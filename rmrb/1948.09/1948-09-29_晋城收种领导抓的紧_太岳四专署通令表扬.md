　　Jincheng Grasps Autumn Harvest and Planting Leadership Tightly
  　Taiyue Fourth Administrative Office Issues Circular Commending
    [Taiyue Electric Dispatch] The Fourth Administrative Office of Taiyue issued a circular commending Jincheng for its rapid progress in promoting the autumn harvest campaign. Since September 3rd, when all districts simultaneously convened village cadre meetings to call for strengthening leadership in production, the masses in all villages have been organized to harvest autumn crops and plant wheat. In just ten days, two-thirds of the county's more than 250,000 mu of millet have been harvested. In nine villages including Houjiang and Weijiang in the Fifth District, more than 2,400 mu of millet were completely harvested by September 8th. To prevent spoilage from rain, the masses in the mountainous areas implemented the practice of cutting, carrying, and threshing simultaneously, and harvested all the millet in the fields within five days. In the Liuquan Administrative Village, 76 percent of the labor force has been organized, with 280 women participating as full laborers, one-third more than the number of male full laborers. All the millet in the village has been harvested, and two-thirds has been threshed, with 1,496 shi having been brought home. Wheat fields throughout the county have generally been plowed once, and most have been plowed twice. According to statistics from 13 villages in the Fourth District, 1,708 mu of the 5,778 mu of dry land wheat fields have been plowed three times. According to statistics from nine villages, 3,750 mu of dry land wheat have already been sown. The reason why Jincheng has been able to do so quickly this year is mainly because the county and district leadership have grasped the work tightly. Before the instructions of the local Party committee and the administrative office on fully mobilizing the autumn harvest campaign were even printed, the Jincheng County Party Committee and the county government had already arranged the work based on the revised draft and issued supplementary instructions, stating that the wheat was planted late last year, resulting in losses, and this year it must be planted early and well, calling on cadres to take the lead and overcome the spontaneous tendency of not paying attention to leading production. At that time, most of the county and district cadres had gone to participate in the district Party committee and local Party committee meetings, and there were very few cadres left in the county. However, in order to strengthen leadership, the county government and the county Party committee organs squeezed out eight cadres to guide the work in various districts.

　　晋城收种领导抓的紧
  　太岳四专署通令表扬
    【太岳电】太岳第四专署通报表扬晋城三秋运动推动的快。自九月三日各区同时召开村干部大会，号召加强领导生产后，各村群众都组织起来收秋种麦。仅十天工夫，全县二十五万多亩谷已割了三分之二。五区候匠、苇匠等九个村二千四百多亩谷，至九月八日已全部割完。山头群众为防止雨沤，实行随割、随担、随打，五天就把全部谷子收到场里。柳泉行政村百分之七十六的劳力已组织起来，光妇女全劳力就参加了二百八十个，比男全劳力还多三分之一。该村谷子已全割完，并打了三分之二，收回家的有一千四百九十六石。全县麦地普遍犁过头遍，大部犁过二遍。据四区十三个村统计：五千七百七十八亩旱麦地，有一千七百零八亩犁过三遍。又据九个村统计：已有三千七百五十亩旱麦地下种。今年晋城所以能做得这样快，主要是县、区领导抓的较紧。当地委、专署全力动员开展三秋运动指示还未印出，晋城县委和县政府即根据修正好的草稿布置了工作，还发出补充指示，说去年麦子种的晚，受了损失，今年要种的早，种的好，号召干部带头，克服不重视领导生产的自流现象。当时全县县、区干部大部参加区党委、地委会议去了，县里留的干部很少，但他们为加强领导，在县府与县委机关挤抽出八个干部到各区指导工作。
