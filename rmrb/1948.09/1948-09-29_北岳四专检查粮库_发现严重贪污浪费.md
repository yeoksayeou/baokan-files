(Editor's note: The above situation is caused by serious bureaucracy; now the leadership has examined the bureaucracy and stipulated future guidelines and methods, which is very good. However, it is not enough to abstractly propose a sentence of "solving legacy issues" for past problems. Various methods should be specifically discussed and resolved thoroughly and completely, otherwise it will be difficult to eliminate.)

[Beiyue News] In order to implement the spirit of the District Party Committee's Financial Committee's "Instructions on Thoroughly Investigating Grain Depots and Strengthening Grain Management," the Fourth Special Administrative Office convened a meeting of grain depot directors from various counties in early this month, and discovered serious chaos in grain and fodder work. Li Laomu, a cadre from the Nanjicheng sub-depot of Lingshou, village head Li Shuzhen, and veteran preferential treatment committee member Shang Laohui privately borrowed 1,280 catties of wheat and 121 catties of corn to open a store to make money. Li Laomu also lent his younger brother 820 catties of wheat. From then on, the grain gate was wide open. No matter whether cadres or the masses encountered happy or sad events, festivals, temple fairs, eating, clothing, opening stores, buying livestock, or treating patients, they could borrow public grain. A total of more than 30 households borrowed 12,534 catties of wheat, 1,647 catties of cotton, and 629 catties of millet. This spring, when the government levied funds, the director of the poor peasant league, the director of the farmers' association, the village head, and the branch secretary of Beijicheng saw the disparity in the rice funds and arbitrarily levied grain, which was then sold to pay the funds. A total of 8,417 catties of millet and 4,537 catties of beans were levied, with a total selling price of 3,294,360 yuan. 2,054,418 yuan was handed over to the district, with a net profit of 1,239,941 yuan. Except for the existing 141,000 yuan in silver, another 256,300 yuan was handed over to the district, and 539,600 yuan in silver was used to repair waterwheels, the remaining 303,011 yuan was wasted and squandered. The two responsible cadres of the Mengjiatuo Village Poor Peasants League and the New Farmers' Association privately sold 1,060 catties of public grain, and colluded with other village cadres, a total of 14 people, to jointly sell 1,995 catties of public grain rice, totaling more than 300,000 yuan in silver, which was distributed among themselves. Village head Meng Jixiang stole 140 catties of rice, and privately sold 400 catties of rice, earning 80,000 yuan in silver. The village head, deputy village head, director of the New Farmers' Association, and finance committee member used public grain for trading, earning more than 700,000 yuan in silver. Last winter, when Baimagang Village levied funds, the government set the price at 140 yuan per catty of rice, but the village collected it at 200 yuan per catty. In the end, 1,018 catties of surplus rice was not returned to the masses. 567 catties were used to offset the old public grain, 336 catties were used for education rice, and the rest was all wasted by the cadres. Last year, during the Spring Festival, the poor peasant league of Gangbei Village proposed eating tofu for the New Year and borrowed 2,000 catties of public grain. The poor people's league of Dongtazikou Village in Zhengding randomly borrowed 700,000 yuan of public funds, the village office used 1,000 catties of public grain, and the cooperative used more than 1,000 catties of public grain and more than 100,000 yuan of public funds (approved by the District Committee). During the levy, the village levied 55,000 catties of public grain, but only handed over 42,000 catties to the district, and the remaining 13,000 catties were wasted. The branch secretary and grain committee member of Quyangqiao Village privately sold 500 catties of public grain black beans and bought a cow. This March, Dong'anfeng Village levied more than 2,000 catties of public grain. The village head, branch secretary, and director of the farmers' association delayed sending it to the district. As a result, on the evening of May 1st, 1,600 catties were stolen.

The above materials from Lingshou were discovered by the special commissioner's grain inspection team. There are still many problems with the county's grain depot. While inspecting and dealing with the problems, it has now recovered more than 19,500 catties of wheat borrowed, more than 1,640 catties of cotton, and more than 1,000 catties of millet; 292 catties of wheat due to improper scaling; 1,084 catties of wheat and 340 catties of millet sold privately, totaling 280,000 yuan; and 750 catties of stolen grain and 1,900 catties of millet embezzled.

The Zhengding materials were discovered through the county's own inspection. There are also many problems in various villages. The leadership is determined to rectify the situation. In other counties, except for Fuping, which is relatively good, there are many problems such as embezzlement, waste, theft, private borrowing, spoilage, and consumption. According to preliminary statistics from eight counties, the losses of millet, wheat, and cotton total 332,919 catties, straw 476,903 catties, and firewood 147,182 catties. Based on these materials, a strict review and criticism was carried out at the meeting. It was unanimously believed that the root cause of this serious loss was the serious bureaucratic style of the leadership, with more arrangements and less inspection, work not being thorough, cadres being irresponsible, and embezzlers and illegal elements not being dealt with in a timely manner. The meeting finally decided that it is necessary to conduct in-depth inspections, truly "go to," "see," and "do," oppose superficiality, cultivate a responsible and not wasteful atmosphere of every catty of public grain and grass, earnestly implement the system, and fight against those who violate the system. County leaders should personally take action to thoroughly clean up village depots and resolve legacy issues. Prepare warehouses, organize warehouses, and equip cadres to accept the upcoming autumn levy tasks.

　　北岳四专检查粮库
  　发现严重贪污浪费
    （编者按：以上情况是严重的官僚主义所造成；现在领导上检查了官僚主义，规定了以后方针与办法，这是很好的。但对过去问题只抽象提出一句“解决遗留问题”是不够的，应该具体讨论各种办法，认真彻底的解决，否则仍难肃清。）
    【北岳讯】四专署为了贯彻区党委财委会“关于彻底清查粮库加强粮食管理”指示的精神，本月上旬召开各县粮库主任会议，发现粮秣工作中有严重的混乱现象。灵寿南纪城分库干部李老木、村长李书珍、优恤委员尚老辉三人私借小麦一二八○斤，玉米一二一斤，开店赚钱，李老木又借给其弟小麦八二○斤。从此粮门大开，不论干部群众遇到红白喜事、过节过庙、吃穿开店、买牲口、养病人均可借公粮，共计三十多户，借小麦一二五三四斤，花料一六四七斤，小米六二九斤。北纪城贫农团主任、农会主任、村长、支书等在今春政府征款时，见到米款悬殊擅自征成粮食，粜粮交款，共征小米八四一七斤，豆子四千五百三十七斤，总卖价三、二九四、三六○元，交区二、○五四、四一八元，净得利一、二三九、九四一元。除现存洋一四一、○○○元，又交区二五六、三○○元，及修置水车用洋五三九、六○○元外，其余三○三、○一一元都乱化浪费了。孟家托村贫农团新农会两个负责干部私卖公粮一、○六○斤，又勾结其他村干共十四人，合卖公粮米一、九九五斤，合洋三十余万元，共同分赃。村长孟吉祥偷米一四○斤，又私卖米四○○斤，赚洋八万元。村长村副新农会主任财政委员用公粮作买卖，赚洋七十余万元。白马岗村去冬征款，政府定价每斤米一百四十元，村里按二百元征收，最后长米一、○一八斤，未退还群众，用五六七斤顶了旧公粮，三三六斤做了教育米，下余的全被干部浪费了。岗北村贫农团去年年节，提出过年吃豆腐，借出公粮二千斤。正定东塌子口村贫民团乱借公款七十万元，村公所动用公粮一千斤，办合作社动用公粮一千多斤，公款十多万元（区委批准的）。在征收当中，本村征了公粮五五、○○○斤，只交区四二、○○○斤，其余一三、○○○斤随便浪费了。曲阳桥村支书粮秣委员私卖公粮黑豆五百斤，合买牛一头。东安丰村今年三月征公粮二千余斤，村长支书农会主任拖延不让送区，结果五月一日晚上，被盗去一千六百斤。
    以上材料，灵寿的问题是专署粮食检查组检查出来的。该县粮库问题尚多，在一面检查一面处理当中，现已收回外借小麦一九、五○○余斤，花料一、六四○余斤，小米一、○○○余斤；折秤不当小麦二九二斤；私卖小麦一、○八四斤，小米三四○斤，二八万元；贪污偷盗谷子七五○斤，小米一、九○○斤。
    正定材料是该县自行检查出来的，各村问题亦不少。领导上已决心大力整顿。其余各县，除阜平较好外，贪污浪费、偷盗、私借、腐烂消耗等问题均很多。据八县初步统计损失小米、小麦、花料共三三二、九一九斤，谷草四七六、九○三斤，木柴一四七、一八二斤。根据这些材料，会上进行了严格的检讨批判，一致认为遭此严重损失的根源，是领导上存在着严重的官僚主义作风，布置多，检查少，工作不深入，干部不负责，对贪污浪费不法分子不及时处理所致。会议最后决定：必须深入检查，切实“走到”，“看到”，“办到”，反对走马观花，养成积极负责，不浪费一斤公粮公草的风气，切实执行制度，与破坏制度者作斗争。各县领导应亲自下手，彻底清理村库，解决遗留问题。准备库房、整理库房，配备干部，以接受将要到来的秋征任务。
