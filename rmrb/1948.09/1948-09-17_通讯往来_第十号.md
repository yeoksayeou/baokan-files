　　Correspondence
　　No. 10 To all regional, special, and county committees' offices, and all correspondents:

　　The autumn harvest and wheat planting season is approaching. All localities should vigorously report on the autumn harvest and wheat planting, as well as the mobilization and organization of autumn plowing:

　　I. How is the leadership fully and deeply leading and organizing the masses in this year's autumn harvest? What is the situation of labor and animal power organization in various places? How are the masses being organized? What role are women and children playing in the autumn harvest? How are households without labor being helped to solve their difficulties? What is the actual harvest situation in various places this year? In disaster-stricken areas, how is the leadership organizing the masses to expand wheat planting and helping to solve wheat planting difficulties? In non-disaster areas, how are the masses combining autumn harvest, wheat planting, and autumn plowing to achieve timely wheat planting and complete autumn plowing universally? How is the production sentiment of the masses stabilized during the autumn harvest, so that the masses can boldly cultivate carefully and expand wheat planting?

　　II. In the border areas' autumn harvest, please focus on reporting our efforts to take the initiative in carrying out the autumn protection struggle. How are the masses organized to combine labor and military affairs, form joint village defenses, launch explosive political offensives to disintegrate enemy puppets, and achieve rapid harvesting, rapid fighting, and rapid concealment? What model deeds and creations have the masses shown in the autumn protection struggle?

　　III. In addition to the above suggestions for reporting, pay attention to having a process and being comprehensive in reporting. What are the problems, characteristics, experiences, and lessons of this year's autumn harvest? What are the ideological problems of the masses? We hope that you will write to us at any time.
