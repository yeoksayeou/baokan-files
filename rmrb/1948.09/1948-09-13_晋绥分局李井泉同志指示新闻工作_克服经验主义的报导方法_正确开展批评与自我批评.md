Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 10th. At the "September 1st" Journalist Day symposium for news workers in the Jin-Sui Border Region, Li Jingquan, Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Jin-Sui Sub-Bureau, delivered a speech on various issues related to news work. He pointed out that the future direction for news workers is to deeply study the Party's policies and practical work. For example, specific experiences in Party rectification, political construction, production, and joining the army should be analyzed, studied, and summarized based on the Party's policies to guide the advancement of the movement. It would be even better if problems in practical work could be elevated to the theoretical level for discussion and debate. He encouraged everyone to improve themselves ideologically and theoretically. He also said that newspapers must overcome empirical reporting methods, otherwise, the newspapers will lag behind the actual movement. Newspapers should strengthen their combativeness and conduct criticism and self-criticism of the shortcomings and errors in the movement. Only by clearly grasping the Party's policies, specifically analyzing practical problems, and correctly conducting criticism and self-criticism can the newspaper become a powerful weapon for promoting and guiding work, and become a combative newspaper. Comrade Li Jingquan pointed out the key points of future reporting: In terms of Party rectification, the main issue is transforming ideology and work style. How to unite the people and lead the mass work is something that must be well resolved in the future. It is not only necessary to report on the contact between individual Party members and the masses, but also to focus on reporting and studying how the Party branch strengthens its connection with the masses and plays a core and leading role in various tasks and movements. In terms of political construction: The People's Representative Conference led the land reform and also did a lot of work in production and disaster relief, joining the army and participating in the war, and supporting the front line, and generally did it very well. However, the People's Representative Conference and the government committee elected by it, this brand-new form of political power, is still in its infancy. How can it better lead the masses in daily work, how to establish a complete organization and work system, these are the issues that the newspaper should focus on publicizing and studying in the future. In terms of production: it is necessary to publicize and promote how to make production plans consciously and voluntarily through the masses, so that the production this winter and next spring will overcome blindness and create a planned large-scale production movement, and to continue to strengthen the publicity of policies through this movement.

　　晋绥分局李井泉同志指示新闻工作
    克服经验主义的报导方法
  　正确开展批评与自我批评
    【新华社晋绥十日电】在晋绥边区新闻工作者“九一”记者节座谈会上，中共中央晋绥分局书记李井泉曾就新闻工作诸问题，发表谈话。他指出新闻工作者今后努力方向是深入研究党的政策和实际工作。如对整党、建政、生产、参军各方面的具体经验，即应根据党的政策，经过分析研究，加以总结，以指导运动前进。如能把实际工作中的问题提高到理论上展开讨论与争论，那就更好。他勉励大家要从政策思想上、理论上提高自己。并且说：报纸要克服经验主义的报导方法，否则就会使报纸落后于实际运动。报纸要加强战斗性，对运动中的缺点和错误，要进行批评与自我批评。只有明确地掌握了党的政策，具体地分析实际问题，正确地开展批评与自我批评，这样才会使报纸成为推动与指导工作的有力武器，成为有战斗性的报纸。至此，李井泉同志指出今后报导的要点：在整党方面，主要是改造思想作风问题。如何团结人民，领导群众工作，这是今后必须很好解决的。不仅要报导党员个人与群众的联系，而且要着重报导及研究党的支部如何加强与群众的联系并在各种工作与运动中起核心与领导作用。建政方面：人民代表会议领导了土地改革，在生产救灾、参军参战、支援前线等方面也做了许多的工作，而且一般都做得很好，但人民代表会议及其选出的政府委员会这个崭新的政权形式还是个雏型，它如何才能更好的领导群众进行日常工作，如何建立一套完整的机构和工作制度，这是报纸今后应该着重宣传与研究的问题。生产方面：要宣传与提倡如何通过群众自觉自愿订生产计划，使今冬及明春的生产克服盲目性，造成有计划的大生产运动，并且要通过这个运动继续加强对政策的宣传。
