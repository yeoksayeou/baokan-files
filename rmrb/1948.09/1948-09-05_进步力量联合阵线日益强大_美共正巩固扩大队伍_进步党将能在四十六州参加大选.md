　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. TASS, Moscow, 26th: *Labor Daily* published an article entitled "The Crisis of the Two-Party System and the American Progressive Party," which stated: The rise of the new American Progressive Party is a direct result of the crisis of the monopoly two-party system and the growing dissatisfaction of the American people with the anti-popular domestic and foreign policies of the rulers. The Progressive Party represents the anti-imperialist and anti-fascist sentiments that permeate the United States, and it appears in the form of a broad united front. It has the support of a large number of workers, the vast majority of farmers, progressive liberal professionals, the urban middle class, and the oppressed black people. All these social strata are united in the common desire to safeguard democratic rights and freedoms. This has been proven by the Progressive Party movement and the party's national congress. The article continued: The American Communist Party, as the independent party activity of the American proletariat, announced its support for the Progressive Party's policy of striving for peace, opposing inflation and fascism. However, the American Communist Party also pointed out that there are differences with Wallace on certain basic and tactical issues. According to recent newspaper reports, the American Communist Party is consolidating and expanding its ranks, strengthening the united front of the working masses, and working towards the unity of action of the American working people to promote democracy, peace and freedom. The article concluded: The united front of American progressive forces against monopoly capital, whose strength and scale are growing day by day, is an indisputable fact.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Reports from various sources: Baldwin, director of the Progressive Party's campaign movement, recently declared that the new party will be able to participate in the November election in forty-four to forty-six of the forty-eight states in the United States. Only in Florida and Oklahoma has the Progressive Party been definitively rejected from participating in the election. Because the rise of the Progressive Party has broken the monopoly of the two parties over elections, according to Baldwin, "the masses will no longer be apathetic in this election, which would have been the case if only Truman and Dewey were competing." Baldwin further predicted that the emergence of the Progressive Party on the American political stage will attract millions of voters who did not participate in the 1946 congressional elections to the polls. The American reactionaries, frightened by the development of the Progressive Party, are imposing various illegal obstacles on the party. In Truman's home state of Missouri, the state's Secretary of State Nelson announced on the 21st the decision that the Progressive Party has no right to campaign in Missouri. In Pennsylvania, Lenny, the Progressive Party's black candidate for Congress, was arrested and beaten by the police. The chairman of the Progressive Party in Missouri has appealed to the Supreme Court, and Lenny has also sued the state police for preventing his legal campaign. Commenting on Missouri's decision to ban the Progressive Party from participating in the election, Wallace pointed out that this was a brazen attempt by Truman and his Democratic Party followers to steal the state's election results. Wallace also said that Truman was clearly frightened by the overwhelming support the Progressive Party had gained among tens of millions of voters. "I warn Truman that the people of Missouri will not tolerate another stolen election."

　　进步力量联合阵线日益强大
  　美共正巩固扩大队伍
  　进步党将能在四十六州参加大选
    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：劳动报于题为“两党制度的危机与美国进步党”一文中写道：美国新的进步党的兴起，乃是垄断的两党制度危机的直接结果，乃是美国人民日益不满于统治者反人民的内外政策的结果。进步党代表着弥漫于全美国的反帝国主义、反法西斯主义的情绪，并以广泛的联合阵线的姿态出现。它拥有大量工人、广大农民、进步自由职业者、城市中产阶级及被压迫的黑人的支持。所有这些社会阶层，都在维护民主权利与自由的共同愿望中团结起来了。这点已由进步党运动及该党全国代表大会所证明。该文继称：作为美国无产阶级独立的政党活动的美国共产党，宣布支持进步党争取和平、反通货膨胀与法西斯主义的政策。但是美共同时指出在某些基本的与策略的问题上，和华莱士有分歧。据最近报纸消息，美国共产党正在巩固与扩大其队伍，加强劳动群众的联合战线，并努力于美国劳动人民行动的统一，以促进民主和平与自由。该文结语称：美国进步力量反独占资本的联合阵线，其力量与规模正与日俱增，乃是一个不可辩驳的事实。
    【新华社陕北一日电】各方报导：据进步党竞选运动主任鲍尔温最近宣称：新党将能在美国四十八州中之四十四州至四十六州，参加十一月大选。仅在佛罗里达与俄克拉荷马两州，进步党才确定地被拒绝参加竞选。由于进步党的兴起打破了两党对选举的垄断，据鲍氏宣称：“这次竞选中群众不会再有漠不关心的现象，而假如只有杜鲁门与杜威对抗，这种现象是会有的。”鲍氏进而预料，进步党在美国政治舞台上的出现，将吸引不曾参加一九四六年国会选举的千百万选民到选举站来。美国反动派慑于进步党的发展，正对该党施以各种非法的刁难。在杜鲁门故乡的密苏里州，该州州务部长纳尔逊于廿一日宣布了进步党无权在密苏里州竞选的决定。在宾夕法尼亚州，进步党的黑人众议员候选人伦尼，竟被警察逮捕与殴伤。密苏里州进步党主席已向最高法院申诉，伦尼亦已控告该州警察阻止其合法竞选。华莱士在评论密苏里州决定禁止进步党参加竞选时指出：这是杜鲁门及其民主党徒众企图窃取该州选举结果的厚颜行为。华氏又称：杜鲁门显然是被进步党在成千万选民中获得的势不可当的支持所吓慌了。“我警告杜鲁门，密苏里的人民是不会容忍再有盗窃的选举的。”
