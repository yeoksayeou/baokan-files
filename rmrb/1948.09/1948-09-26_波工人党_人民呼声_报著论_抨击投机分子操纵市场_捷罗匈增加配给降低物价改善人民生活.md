Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Telecommunications Agency, 15th: In the past two weeks, shortages of meat, butter, fats, and sugar have occurred in Polish cities. The Polish Workers' Party organ, the People's Voice newspaper, emphasized on the 15th when discussing this matter: The current food shortage "has no objective basis but is caused by the clandestine activities of capitalist elements—enemies of the working class. Saboteurs are consciously brewing alarming noises, spreading anxiety, and frightening naive consumers; at the same time, they hide goods behind counters and in warehouses to obtain huge profits." The People's Voice newspaper continued: Fortunately, we have sufficient goods and political and economic methods to eliminate the saboteurs, and they will be dealt a heavy blow. The organization of state-owned stores and cooperatives will "allocate meat, adjust prices, eliminate speculators as soon as possible, and ensure fair and uniform distribution throughout the year by eliminating the seasonal shortages that have enriched speculators." The People's Voice newspaper also warned: "Organized workers will teach those who need to be taught not to mess with the workers' daily bread."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania continue to increase rations and lower prices to improve the lives of the working people. Czechoslovakia has increased the bread ration for children under twelve from 20 pounds to 21 pounds per month, and for adults from 21 pounds to 26 pounds, since September 1st; workers and mothers with children receive even more. From November, the sugar ration will be increased from 2 pounds 1.5 ounces to 3 pounds per month, and workers will receive an extra pound of sugar and 3.5 ounces of lard for Christmas. This action by the Czechoslovak government has won the heartfelt support of the working people throughout the country. Employees in various regions have sent telegrams, letters, or resolutions to the President, the Cabinet, and the Central Action Committee of the National Front, expressing their deep gratitude. The Romanian government decided on September 15th to generally reduce prices again from October 1st. The decision pointed out that this is because workers are full of labor enthusiasm, labor productivity has greatly increased, and production costs have been greatly reduced after the nationalization of banks, industry, and transportation, and industrial products have greatly increased. The Hungarian government also announced on the 14th of this month that the prices of canned fruits and canned vegetables would be reduced by 25 percent.

　　波工人党“人民呼声”报著论
  　抨击投机分子操纵市场
    捷罗匈增加配给降低物价改善人民生活
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】电通社十五日讯：过去两周中，波兰各城市发生肉类、牛油、脂肪、及食糖等物的缺货现象，波兰工人党机关报人民呼声报，十五日于论及此事时着重指出：目前的粮荒“并无客观的基础，而是由资本主义分子——工人阶级的敌人——暗地的活动所引起的；破坏分子有意识地酝酿惊人的嚣闹，散布不安，吓唬天真的消费者；而同时，他们却把货物藏在柜台里，藏在库房里，从而获取大利。”人民呼声报继称：我们幸而有足够的货物，和政治经济的方法来清除破坏分子，他们将受到重大的打击。国营商店与合作社的组织，将“尽早达到肉类的分配、调整价格，清除投机分子，并以消除曾使投机分子致富的季节性缺货现象的方法，来确保全年公正与一律的分配。”人民呼声报并警告称：“有组织的工人们将教训那些需要教训的人们，不要在工人每日的面包上来捣乱。”
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】捷克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚三国继续增加配给、降低物价，以改善劳动人民生活。捷克自九月一日起将十二岁以下儿童的面包配给量自每月二十磅增加至二十一磅，成人自二十一磅增加至二十六磅，工人与带孩子的母亲超过此数。十一月起，食糖配给量将自每月二磅一两半增加至三磅，工人在圣诞节的配给将额外增加一磅糖和三两半猪油。捷克政府此举获得全国劳动人民衷心拥戴，各地职工均致电、致函、或通过决议向总统、内阁与民族阵线中央行动委员会表示深切的感激。罗马尼亚政府九月十五日决议自十月一日起再度普遍减低物价，决议指出这是因为在银行、工业与运输业国有化以后，工人们充满了劳动热情，劳动生产率大为提高，生产成本已大为减低，工业产品已大为增加。匈牙利政府亦于本月十四日宣布罐头水果与罐头蔬菜的价格降低百分之二十五。
