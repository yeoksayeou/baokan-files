Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Telegraphic dispatch from the Telegraph Agency: The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) will hold its quarterly regular meeting in Paris from the 17th to the 21st of this month. The first item on the agenda is the All-Asia Trade Union Conference; others include: the results of the seventh session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council in Geneva; the WFTU's plans regarding labor hygiene, workplace safety equipment, and treatment for illnesses caused by poor working conditions; the further suppression of trade unions and civil liberties in India; the situation of trade unions in Germany and Greece; the labor situation in Latin America; and the agenda for the Second World Trade Union Congress to be held in Brussels this December. Prior to the regular meeting, the WFTU Executive Bureau will consult with representatives of the International Trade Secretariats (ITS) to resolve the issue of incorporating the old ITS into the WFTU. British and American right-wing labor leaders have been doing their utmost to delay and obstruct the incorporation of the ITS into the WFTU because they see the ITS as a possible foundation for an American-controlled international labor organization and use it to split the WFTU.

　　世界工联执委会在巴黎举行常会
    【新华社陕北十五日电】电通社讯：世界工联执委会将于本月十七日至二十一日在巴黎举行三个月一次的常会。议程首项为全亚洲职工大会问题；其他为：日内瓦联合国经社理事会第七届会议的成果；世界工联关于劳工卫生、工作安全设备与因劳动条件不良而罹病的待遇等问题的计划；印度进一步镇压职工会与公民自由问题；德国、希腊职工会的情况；拉丁美洲的劳工情况；将于今年十二月在布鲁塞尔召开的第二届世界职工代表大会的议程。在常会召开之前，世界工联执行局将与国际职工秘书处代表会商，解决将旧的国际职工秘书处并入世界工联问题，英美右翼劳工领袖已尽力拖延与阻挠将国际职工秘书处并入世界工联，因为他们把国际职工秘书处看作一个美国控制下的国际劳工机构的可能基础，并用它来分裂世界工联。
