[Ji Lu Yu Telegram] Huang Youheng, battalion commander of the Special Service Battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's Reorganized 83rd Division (number 6482), and Wang Ziyun, deputy battalion commander, dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's rule and unwilling to die for Chiang Kai-shek, took advantage of a field exercise on the 16th of last month to lead all 434 officers and soldiers of the battalion in an uprising in Feng County. The weapons they brought included 4 heavy machine guns, 80 light machine guns, 4 60mm mortars, 36 submachine guns, 88 rifles, 11 twenty-round rapid-fire pistols, 7 ten-round pistols, 4 grenade launchers, 6 rifle grenades, over 1,000 hand grenades, and over 20,000 rounds of various ammunition. The battalion arrived at a certain location on the 25th, and the military region and administrative office hosted a special banquet on the 26th. All officers and soldiers expressed their gratitude and stated that they would serve the people to the end in the future. On the 26th, the reporter visited Huang Youheng and his wife, Gu Jingyu, at a certain location. When the reporter asked, "Battalion Commander Huang, what is the main reason for this uprising?" he said, "Over there, I was completely desperate. I wanted to serve the country and the people, but it turned out to be harming the country and the people! I cannot go against my conscience, so I made up my mind to come to the Communist side. We came here in pursuit of the truth."
