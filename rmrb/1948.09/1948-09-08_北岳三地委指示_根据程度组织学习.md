　　Northern Yue Third Prefectural Committee Instruction
　　Organize Learning According to Level
　　[Northern Yue Electric] The Third Prefectural Committee of the CCP Northern Yue District, summarizing the cadre study in the sub-district in July, the main gain was that study was linked to practice. Especially in studying "Preface to Chapter Two of 'Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder' (Reprinted)" in conjunction with documents such as "Opposing Liberalism," "Strengthening Party Spirit Cultivation," and "Gutian Conference," most cadres in various agencies reflected on themselves in connection with their personal situations. Many comrades wrote reflective notes. Some, in connection with the work of their own agencies, focused on carrying out the struggle against bad tendencies. For example, in its study, the Huaxing Company examined the lack of organization, discipline, and anarchic state in the thinking, work style, and work of the agency's individuals, and launched a ruthless ideological struggle against the shortcomings of comrades ×× and ×××, such as corruption, waste, liberalism, sectarianism, irresponsibility in work, and lack of discipline, and strictly enforced discipline. Through this practical education, the awareness and enthusiasm of all personnel were enhanced. The Huaxing Company's study was done relatively well, mainly because the leading cadres of the agency attached importance to study and personally led everyone. Generally, in the cadre study in the entire sub-district, there are still the following shortcomings: (1) The study requirements are generalized. People study everything without distinguishing levels. They simply follow the department and everyone studies together. As a result, those with high levels cannot further develop, while those with low levels feel very strenuous. (2) The study methods are too simple. Many departments use the method of one person reading and everyone listening, followed by discussion. As a result, due to the different levels of everyone, they cannot delve into it. (3) Individual departments are not active and are largely forced to study, emphasizing that they are too busy with work to study. Therefore, the Prefectural Committee hereby gives the following instructions for future study: (1) In the implementation of the unified study plan, each unit must put forward different requirements according to the different levels and standards of cadres. For example, when studying the Central Committee's instructions on land reform and party rectification in 1948, comrades who have done actual land reform work should link it with practice and conduct in-depth discussions. Cadres who have not done actual land reform work are required to understand the essential spirit of the document. (2) In terms of learning methods, self-study, explanation, and discussion should be combined. Those with poor comprehension ability can focus on explanation and discussion; those with high levels can focus on self-study and discussion. Therefore, the various agencies and departments should organize backbone groups to implement the method of taking the lead, or designate special personnel to help comrades with low levels to explain. (3) Overcome the erroneous views and understandings of "It's okay not to study, but it's impossible not to work" and "Study conflicts with work." It is necessary to clearly understand: study is for work, and study is part of work.

　　北岳三地委指示
  　根据程度组织学习
    【北狱电】中共北狱区三地委，总结分区七月份干部学习，主要收获是学习与实际得到联系。特别在学习“重印左派幼稚病第二章前言”时与“反对自由主义”、“增强党性锻炼”、“古田会议”等文件结合学习中，各机关干部大部联系个人，作了反省。不少同志写了反省笔记。有的联系本机关工作，有重点的开展了反不良倾向的斗争。如华兴公司在学习中，曾检查机关个人思想、作风、工作中的无组织无纪律无政府状态，对××、×××二同志贪污浪费、自由主义、闹宗派、工作不负责、缺乏纪律性等缺点，展开了无情的思想斗争，严格的执行了纪律。经过这一实际教育，提高了全体人员认识及积极性。华兴公司的学习搞得较好，主要原因是该机关的领导干部重视学习，并亲自带动了大家。总的检讨起来，在全分区干部学习中，尚存有以上缺点：（一）学习要求一般化，学习什么都学习什么，不分程度，单纯按部门，大家都在一起学习，结果程度高的不能进一步发挥，低的却感觉很费劲。（二）学习方法太单纯，很多部门都是用一人读，大家听，完了讨论的方法，结果由于大家程度不一，都钻不进去。（三）个别部门不积极，带有很大的被迫性，强调工作繁忙，学习不了。为此，地委对今后的学习特作如下指示：（一）在执行统一的学习计划中，各单位要根据干部的不同程度与水平，提出不同要求。如学习一九四八年中央关于土改与整党指示时，作过土改实际工作的同志，就要联系实际，作深入的讨论。没有作过土改实际工作的干部，要求他们能了解文件的精神实质。（二）在学习方法上要把自习、讲解、讨论结合起来进行。理解能力差的可以讲解讨论为主；程度高的可以自习讨论为主。因此，各机关部门，应组织骨干组，实行带头的办法，或指定专人帮助程度低的同志进行讲解。（三）克服“不学习可以，不作工作不成。”“学习与工作矛盾”的错误观点与认识，要明确认识：学习就是为了工作，学习就是工作的一部分。
