　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Reports from various sources: The new provocative actions of the Dutch invading army against Indonesia have aroused increasing anger among the Indonesian people. A TASS dispatch on the 9th, citing "Dutch-Indonesian News" and Dutch news agencies, reported that Dutch troops attacked 800 Indonesian soldiers in the Garut area of ​​West Java. Dutch troops continued so-called "mopping-up operations" in West Java, rampaging through the Karawang area, searching over 10,000 Indonesian people, arresting 400, and massacring 47. According to an AFP dispatch on the 11th, the Dutch military commander-in-chief in East Java, unable to suppress the resistance movement of the Indonesian people in the occupied areas, issued an ultimatum to Indonesia on the 8th, unreasonably demanding that Indonesia cease "destructive actions" in the Dutch-occupied areas within 48 hours. The Deputy Commander of the Indonesian Army in East Java has refused this. A TASS dispatch on the 14th, citing reports from the Indonesian news agency, stated that Indonesia's "Suara" newspaper, "Ibu" newspaper, "Kota" newspaper, and "Revolutionary" newspaper all pointed out that the Dutch ultimatum was an attempt to force the Republic to make further concessions in order to finally eliminate the Republic, and all newspapers expressed indignation at this. A TASS dispatch on the 14th, citing news from Dutch newspapers and news agencies, stated that the Indonesian Communist Party has issued an appeal, calling on the people to prepare to meet the new Dutch aggression, and to fight for their freedom by all means, including implementing a "scorched earth" policy when necessary. Indonesian Communist Party leader Muso said in a speech at a mass meeting in Madiun: "We do not recognize any agreement with the Netherlands." He called on the Indonesian people to resolutely resist the Dutch aggressors.

　　印尼共产党号召人民
  　坚决反击荷帝新侵略
    【新华社陕北十八日电】各方报导：荷兰侵略军对印尼之新的挑衅行动，使印尼人民的愤怒日益增加。塔斯社九日电引“荷印新闻”与荷兰通讯社消息，荷军在西爪哇之加鲁塔地区袭击八百印尼军，荷军继续在西爪哇进行所谓“扫荡战”，在加拉旺地区对万余印尼人民横行搜索，逮捕了四百人，残杀了四十七人。另据法新社十一日消息：东爪哇荷军总司令因无法压制其侵占区内印尼人民的抵抗运动，竟于八日向印尼提出最后通牒，无理要求印尼于四十八小时内停止在荷占区内的“破坏行动”。东爪哇印尼军副司令对此已加拒绝。塔斯社十四日电引印尼通讯社报导：印尼的“苏亚拉”报、“伊布”报、“柯塔”报及“革命者”报都指出荷兰的最后通牒是企图迫使共和国作进一步的让步，以便最后消灭共和国，各报对此均表愤慨。塔斯社十四日电引荷兰报纸通讯社的消息称：印尼共产党已为此发出呼吁，号召人民必须准备迎击荷兰的新侵略，必须以一切方法为自己的自由而战，包括必要时实行“焦土”政策。印尼共产党领袖穆索在马地恩的群众大会上讲演说：“我们不承认任何与荷兰的协议”。他号召印尼人民坚决反击荷兰侵略者。
