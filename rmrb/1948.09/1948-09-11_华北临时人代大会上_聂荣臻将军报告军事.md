Xinhua News Agency, North China, 8th: General Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the North China Military Region, reported to the North China Provisional People's Congress on August 10th, on the great victories of the People's Liberation War in North China over the past two years. General Nie pointed out: The North China Liberated Area was created under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, through the long-term bloody struggle of the broad masses of people and the People's Liberation Army in North China. Besides the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, this is the oldest liberated area in the country, with a long-standing foundation of work by our Party, the workers' movement since the "February 7th" strike, the peasants' struggle since the First Great Revolution, and the glorious revolutionary traditions of the May Fourth and December 9th student movements. Here, we stood together with the broad masses of people and persisted in the eight-year arduous War of Resistance Against Japan, smashing countless frenzied mopping-up operations by the enemy. If we forget this history, we cannot imagine what the North China Liberated Area is today. General Nie recounted the course of the war and the victories achieved on the North China battlefield from the beginning of the Liberation War in July 1946 to the present, stating: In the first year of the war, the Kuomintang reactionaries concentrated seventy-three brigades and launched offensives against our Chahar, southern Shanxi, northern Henan, western Shandong, and southern Hebei simultaneously with superior forces. At that time, under the wise strategic guidance of Chairman Mao, in order to concentrate our forces to annihilate the enemy's effective strength, and without being concerned about the gains and losses of one city or one place, we voluntarily withdrew from sixty-five cities. This forced the enemy to disperse their forces to guard points and lines, creating favorable conditions for our army to annihilate the enemy. Therefore, by January 1947, the strategic offensive of the Kuomintang bandit army on the North China battlefield had been thwarted. From February to April, our army had completely grasped the initiative. From April to June, our army carried out continuous offensive operations on all fronts in North China, annihilating a large number of enemies and recovering and liberating dozens of county towns. As a result of the first year of combat, a total of 430,000 enemies were annihilated, breaking the enemy's division of the central Hebei area from the northern Yue area, and the northern Yue area from the Taihang area; causing the enemy to fall into a passive position with insufficient forces, while our initiative was increasingly strengthened. In the second year of the war, the Shandong and Northwest battlefields inflicted continuous and serious blows on the enemy, and the three major armies of Liu Deng, Chen Xie, and Chen Su successively marched south, turning to strategic offensives, gloriously realizing Chairman Mao's strategic policy of pushing the war into the Kuomintang-controlled areas. This enabled the North China Liberated Area to smoothly carry out the task of clearing the enemy in its hinterland. From the second half of last year to the first half of this year, we successively liberated important strategic strongholds such as Shijiazhuang, Yuncheng, and Linfen, and recovered southern Chahar and northern Yanbei. Recently, the Jinzhong campaign, directly commanded by Comrades Xu Xiangqian and Zhou Shidi, recovered all areas outside Taiyuan and fourteen county towns. At present, except for the isolated city of Taiyuan, which is besieged by our forces, all the strongholds left by the enemy in the center of the North China Liberated Area have been cleared, and the North China Liberated Area has been completely connected with the Shandong and Jin Sui Liberated Areas. Now, our army on the northern front has cut off the Pingbao Line, isolating Baoding; another unit of our army has entered eastern Hebei to fight, and the victory of the third year of the war is foreseeable. In total, over the past two years, the enemy has been eliminated, reaching 713,800 people, including 451,000 captured, 253,000 killed or wounded, and over 9,000 who revolted and returned to our side. A total of over 260,000 rifles and short guns, over 20,000 light and heavy machine guns, over 4,000 artillery pieces, and other large quantities of military fire weapons and equipment were seized. The number of liberated cities increased by forty-three after offsetting gains and losses.

　　General Nie Rongzhen pointed out: Our victories were by no means accidental. Because the justice of our war represents the interests of the broad masses of the people, the people consciously and willingly participate in, support, and support this new democratic revolutionary war against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In particular, because the basic areas of the North China Liberated Area implemented rent reduction and interest reduction, reasonable burdens, and democratic politics during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and universally promoted land reform after the surrender of Japanese bandits, realizing "land to the tiller," the people's political awareness and organizational strength reached a considerable level. This enabled them to have an unwavering determination to thoroughly eliminate imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the Kuomintang reactionary group. The people in areas such as Ji-Lu-Yu, northern Henan, and the Pingjinbao triangle area are now not only directly fighting heroically against the Kuomintang army and the disasters and Yellow River floods they created, which are even more serious than during the Japanese occupation, but also undertaking and completing arduous war service under the conditions of a seesaw battle between the enemy and us. The people of North China sent a large number of outstanding sons and daughters into the People's Liberation Army, forming today's powerful North China Field Army and local army, and also forming the ever-victorious Liu Deng Army, which, under the wise command of Generals Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping, crossed the perilous Yellow River, liberated the 40 million people of the Central Plains, and restored and opened up the Central Plains Liberated Area; at the same time, the people of North China continue to support the war in the Central Plains with all possible manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Therefore, our victory should first of all be attributed to the people, and victory is also the people's own.

　　General Nie then pointed out: The experience of the past twenty years and more has proved that without the great strategic policy of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we cannot carry out a victorious revolution and a victorious revolutionary war. The Liberation War of the past two years has also proved the complete correctness of Chairman Mao's strategic policy and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's command. Precisely because we have the correct strategic policy, and at the same time we rely on the meticulous planning, courageous fighting, and hard work of all the commanders and fighters and logistics personnel, carried out a new type of military consolidation within the army, implemented the three major democracies of military, political, and economic affairs, strengthened daily political work and policy discipline education, and improved relations between the army and the people, the political awareness and combat effectiveness of the troops, especially their ability to attack strongholds, have been greatly improved. Therefore, it has been possible to forcibly occupy strongly fortified cities such as Shijiazhuang, Yuncheng, and Linfen. This has greatly improved the military, political, and economic status of the North China Liberated Area, enabling us to further strengthen support for the war and continuously achieve victory in the war.

　　General Nie also pointed out: Our war is a comprehensive war led by the proletariat and closely combining the military, political, economic, and cultural aspects of the masses of the people against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Therefore, in the future, under the conditions of thoroughly eliminating the feudal system, liberating productive forces, and relatively stable environment, the central task of the North China Liberated Area is to do everything possible to restore and develop production, strive to build, and more powerfully support the front line of the Liberation War. Only when all the forces in the rear are fully mobilized and organized, developing production, and supporting the front line, can we achieve a more decisive and complete victory in the Liberation War; and only the victory of the war can consolidate and develop our production and political, economic, cultural, and other construction undertakings, that is, consolidate and develop the achievements of the people's war victory.

　　Finally, General Nie Rongzhen called on the military and civilians of the entire region to prepare for the possibility of encountering many difficulties and twists and turns on the road to final victory, and to continue to wage arduous struggles. At present, in addition to continuing to fight in the northern section of Pinghan and eastern Hebei, our North China Field Army is thoroughly eliminating the enemy in Shanxi. Only the two isolated cities of Taiyuan and Datong remain in the entire territory of Shanxi. Its complete liberation and the complete annihilation of the Yan Xishan bandit army are not far off. At the same time, we must continue to thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit armies entrenched on the northern front, and fight valiantly for the liberation of the entire North China, in order to cooperate with and accelerate the final victory of the National Liberation War.

　　华北临时人代大会上
  　聂荣臻将军报告军事
    【新华社华北八日电】华北军区司令员聂荣臻将军八月十日代表华北军区，向华北临时人民代表大会报告两年来华化人民解放战争的伟大胜利。聂将军指出：华北解放区是在中国共产党领导下，由华北广大人民和人民解放军长期流血斗争所创造的。在全国范围内除了陕甘宁边区以外这里是最老的解放区，这里曾有我党长期工作的基础，“二七”以来的工人运动，第一次大革命以来的农民斗争和五四及一二九以来的学生运动等光荣的革命传统。在这里，我们曾经和广大人民在一起，坚持了八年最艰苦的抗日战争，粉碎了敌寇无数次疯狂的扫荡。如果忘记了这些历史，就不能想象会有今天这样的一个华北解放区。聂将军叙述自一九四六年七月解放战争开始迄今两年来在华北战场上的战争经过与胜利战绩称：战争的第一年，国民党反动派集中了七十三个旅，以优势兵力向我察哈尔、晋南、豫北、鲁西、冀南同时举行进攻。当时我们在毛主席英明的战略方针指导下，为集中兵力歼敌有生力量，不计较一城一地得失，曾主动撤离了六十五座城市。迫敌分兵把守点线，造成了我军歼敌的有利条件。因此，到一九四七年一月国民党匪军在华北战场上的战略进攻就已遭顿挫。二月至四月我军已完全掌握了主动权。四月至六月我军在华北各战线进行了连续的攻势作战，歼灭了大量的敌人，收复和解放了几十座县城。第一年作战的结果，共歼敌四十三万人。打破了敌人对冀中与北岳、北岳与太行的分割；使敌人陷于被动和兵力不足，我主动地位则日益增强。战争的第二年，山东和西北两大战场给予敌人连续的严重打击，刘邓、陈谢、陈粟三支大军先后南征，转入战略进攻，光荣地实现了毛主席的把战争推向国民党统治区的战略方针，这就使华北解放区得以顺利进行肃清腹地敌人的任务。从去年下半年到今年上半年，我们即先后解放了石家庄、运城、临汾等重要战略据点，收复了察南、雁北。最近由徐向前、周士第两同志直接指挥的晋中作战，又收复了太原外围全部地区及十四座县城。目前除被我围困的太原孤城外，敌人留在华北解放区中心的据点已全部肃清，并使华北解放区与山东与晋绥两解放区完全衔接起来。现在北线我军又打断了平保线，孤立了保定；我另部并已进入冀东作战，战争第三年的胜利是可预期的。总计两年来消灭敌人共达七十一万三千八百余人。其中俘四十五万一千人，毙伤廿五万三千余人，起义来归的九千余人。共缴获长短枪二十六万余支，轻重机枪两万余挺，炮四千余门及其他大量军火武器和装备。解放城市得失相抵增加四十三座。
    聂荣臻将军指出：我们获得这些胜利决不是偶然的。因为我们战争的正义性，代表广大人民的利益，因此人民自觉自愿地参加、拥护和支持这一反对帝国主义反封建主义反官僚资本主义的新民主主义的革命战争。特别是由于华北解放区的基本地区，在抗日时期曾实行减租减息，合理负担，和民主政治，在日寇投降后又普遍地推行土地改革，实现了耕者有其田，人民政治觉悟和组织力量达到相当的高度，这就使他们对反帝反封建反官僚资本主义，彻底消灭国民党反动集团具有坚定不移的决心。冀鲁豫，豫北，与平津保三角地区等地的人民，现在不但直接与国民党军及其所制造的比日寇时期更为惨重的灾难和黄灾作英勇搏斗，并在敌我拉锯作战的情况下，担负和完成了繁重的战争勤务。华北人民把大批优秀子弟送入解放军，组成了今天这样强大的华北野战军与地方军，而且组成了常胜的刘邓大军，在刘伯承、邓小平两将军英明指挥下横渡黄河天险，解放中原四千万人民，恢复和开辟了中原解放区；同时华北人民并继续以一切可能的人力、物力、财力支援中原的战争。因此我们的胜利，首先应归功于人民，胜利也就是人民自己的。
    聂将军继指出：近二十余年来经验证明，离开了中共中央毛主席的伟大的战略方针，我们就不能进行胜利的革命和胜利的革命战争。两年来的解放战争同样证明了毛主席战略方针和朱总司令指挥的完全正确。正因为我们有正确的战略方针，同时我们又依靠了全体部队指战员与后勤人员的精心计划，奋勇作战与努力工作，在军队内部进行了新式整军，实行了军事、政治、经济三大民主，加强了日常政治工作与政策纪律教育，改善军内军外关系，使部队政治觉悟、战斗力特别是攻坚能力大大提高，因此能够强攻占领象石家庄、运城、临汾等坚固设防的城市。这就大大改善了华北解放区的军事、政治、经济的地位，使我们能够进一步加强支援战争，不断的取得战争的胜利。
    聂将军又指出：我们的战争是无产阶级领导的人民大众的反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义的军事、政治、经济、文化等密切结合的全面战争。因此，今后华北解放区，在彻底消灭封建制度，生产力获得解放，及环境相对的安定的条件下，中心任务是全力恢复与发展生产，努力建设，更有力地支援解放战争的前线。只有一切后方的力量充分动员与组织起来，发展生产，支援前线，才能够取得解放战争更有决定意义的和彻底的胜利；也只有战争的胜利才能够巩固与发展我们的生产和政治、经济、文化等各项建设事业，亦即巩固与发展人民战争胜利的成果。
    最后，聂荣臻将军号召全区军民，在走向最后胜利的道路上，还要准备可能遇到许多困难和曲折，还须继续作艰苦的斗争。我华北野战军目前除在平汉北段和冀东继续作战外，正在彻底消灭着山西的敌人，山西全境只剩下太原与大同两座孤城，它的全部解放和阎锡山匪军的全部消灭，已为期不远了，同时，我们还要继续去彻底消灭盘踞北线的蒋傅匪军，为解放全华北而奋勇作战，以配合与加速全国解放战争最后胜利的到来。
