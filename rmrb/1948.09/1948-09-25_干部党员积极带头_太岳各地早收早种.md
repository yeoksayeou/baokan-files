Cadres and Party Members Actively Lead:
	Early Harvesting and Planting in Various Parts of Taiyue

[Taiyue Electric] The autumn harvest and wheat planting campaign has begun in various parts of Taiyue. In Tunliu County, 150,000 mu of wheat will soon be sown. In Yangcheng County, 200,000 mu of the 210,000 mu of beans have already been harvested. In Nanma Village, Jicheng, wheat sowing was completed in eight days. In Tunliu, Qinyuan, Yangcheng, and Qinshui, leadership has been strengthened from top to bottom this time, and attention has been paid to overcoming laissez-faire attitudes. In Jincheng, district leaders convened meetings of village chiefs, heads of farmers' associations, labor heroes, and mutual aid team leaders to identify cadres with sentiments of waiting for or fearing Party rectification, as well as fears of land appropriation leading to reluctance to apply manure. The leadership immediately clarified the principles of Party rectification, explained the Administrative Office's autumn production instructions, and made it clear that land reform in our region had been basically completed, land rights had been largely determined, and people's minds had been initially stabilized. In Nanma Village, Third District of Jicheng, 800 mu of wheat typically took a month to sow, but this time, on one hand, ideological concerns were resolved, and on the other hand, the organization was good, and it was completed in eight days. Regarding organizational leadership, the methods adopted varied depending on the organizational situation in different regions. In villages with a foundation of mutual aid and labor exchange, cadres went deep into mutual aid teams and worked with the masses in the fields, leading from production. This was relatively successful in Gaoping: cadres and Party members took the lead, first completing the fertilizer accumulation plan, and then continued to lead the promotion of wheat planting and autumn harvesting. For example, in Pangcun, Xia Yujing, Zaili, and Longqu villages, Party member cadres took the lead in applying more fertilizer themselves during wheat planting, which promoted everyone to apply more fertilizer. Zaili Village applied 1,288 loads of Artemisia grass fertilizer and 656 cartloads of pond fertilizer to 64 mu of wheat land, and planted it in a timely manner. Leadership has also been strengthened in most areas of Tunliu, Yangcheng, and Qinshui. In areas where mutual aid teams have disbanded, cadres lead the rectification and restoration of mutual aid teams. Examples include Dongjiashan in Qinshui and Yangyi in Yangcheng, where the reasons for the disbandment of mutual aid teams were examined, and restoration or reorganization was carried out based on the principle of voluntary participation and equal value. In particular, further organization was carried out to involve women, children, and semi-laborers in the autumn harvest and wheat planting. In villages such as Zaili in Gaoping, women were organized to work in the fields, sharing the burden of autumn harvest and wheat planting, and stubble removal with men. Yan Zhixian, the Party branch secretary, and Shen Meirong, the women's association chairman, of Nanzhuang Village in Jincheng, first mobilized and organized four women to work in the fields, harvesting six mu of grain and one and a half mu of corn in three days, which influenced everyone to request participation in the organization. Gradually, a total of 151 women were organized. Even women with bound feet voluntarily went to the fields. Due to the strengthened leadership, first, the realization of the early harvest and early planting plan was guaranteed. The Administrative Office called for planting around the White Dew solar term, which can generally be achieved in various regions. In previous years, some people even planted seeds by the Autumn Equinox, but this year, some wheat seedlings have already emerged. Villages such as Nanma in Jicheng already have seedlings an inch high. This, on the one hand, guarantees an early harvest next spring, and on the other hand, can prevent wheat scab. Early harvesting of millet can prevent wind and rain damage, reducing losses. Second, the masses have begun to pay attention to seed selection. Xucun exchanged more than ten shi of good wheat seeds, and Donglu mixed seeds with oil. Third, some areas have achieved deep plowing and sufficient fertilizer application, such as Nanma, Ganquan, and Dongshoucheng in Jicheng, and Pangcun, Xia Yujing, Zaili, Pucun in Gaoping, and Yaozetou and Xucun in Tunliu, where each mu of land was fertilized with more than 30 loads, and most were plowed three times. According to the masses, this is unprecedented in the past decade. However, it was also discovered that in Xijia Village, Tunliu, due to the lack of correction of deviations, the masses had many concerns, and wheat planting was very perfunctory, with some plowing once, some plowing and sowing in one pass, and very little fertilizer applied, only three to five loads per mu. According to the rectification situation in the entire region, this may not be an isolated case, but rather representative of a small number of villages.

　　干部党员积极带头
  　太岳各地早收早种
    【太岳电】太岳各地已展开秋收种麦运动。屯留全县十五万亩麦子即将种完。阳城全县二十一万亩豆子已收二十万亩。冀城南马村八天就把麦种完。无论屯留、沁源、阳城、沁水，此次均由上而下的加强了领导，注意了克服放任自流。晋城各区分别召开了各村村长、农会主席、劳动英雄、互助组长会议，检查出干部有等待整党、害怕整党的情绪，也有怕抽地而不敢上粪的。领导上即具体说明整党方针，讲解行署秋季生产指示，明确指示我区土地改革已基本完成，地权已大体确定，初步安定了人心。冀城三区南马村有八百亩麦子，平常得一个月种完，这次一方面解决了思想顾虑，一方面组织力量好，八天就种完了。在组织领导上，因各地组织起来情况不同，采取的方法也不同。一种是互助变工有基础的村，干部深入互助组与群众一块到地劳动，从生产中来领导，这在高平比较成功：干部党员带头，首先完成了积肥计划，接着继续带头推动种麦秋收。如庞村、下玉井、宰李、龙渠各村党员干部在种麦中首先自己多上粪，推动了大家多上粪。宰李村六十四亩麦地就上了青蒿粪一千二百八十八担，上池粪六百五十六车，又及时种上。屯留、阳城、沁水等大部地区也加强了领导。另一种是互助组已经散伙的地区，干部领导整顿恢复互助组。如沁水董家山、阳城阳邑一类村子，检查了互助组散伙原因，又根据自愿等价原则恢复或重新组织。尤其是进一步的组织了妇女儿童全半劳力参加秋收种麦。高平宰李等村组织妇女上地，与男人分担收秋种麦、割谷盘茬。晋城南庄支部书记阎志先、妇会主席申美容，先动员组织了四个妇女上地，三天割谷六亩，玉子一亩半，影响大家也要求参加组织，逐渐发展，共组织起一百五十一个妇女。连小脚妇女也自动上了地。由于加强了领导，第一，保证了早收早种计划的实现。行署号召白露前后种上，大体各地都可做到。往年甚至到秋分还有人下种，今年有些麦苗现在已经出土。冀城南马等村已有寸把高。这一方面是明春保证了明年早收，另方面能防止黄黑疸病。谷子早收了可以防止风磨雨沤，减少收成。第二，群众已开始注意选种。许村调换了十多石好麦种，东鲁用油拌种子。第三，有些地区作到了犁深粪饱，如冀城南马、甘泉、东寿城、高平庞村、下玉井、宰李、朴村、屯留尧泽头、许村等村，每亩粪都上到三十担以上，大部犁了三遍。据群众反映，这是十年来所未有的。但也发现了屯留西贾村因没纠偏，群众存在很多顾虑，种麦非常潦草，有的犁了一遍，有的连犁带种一遍，上粪很少，每亩才上三、五担。根据全区纠偏情形，可能这不是个别的，而是代表一小部分村庄的。
