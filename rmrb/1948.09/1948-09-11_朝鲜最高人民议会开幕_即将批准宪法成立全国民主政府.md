Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: TASS, Pyongyang, 3rd: The North Korean Supreme People's Assembly held its first meeting in Pyongyang on September 2nd. Three hundred and sixty representatives from South Korea and two hundred and twelve representatives from North Korea attended. The meeting was opened by Tan Younian (transliteration), an 82-year-old non-partisan farmer from South Korea and veteran of the liberation movement. After pointing out the historical significance of the North Korean Supreme People's Assembly, Tan stated: The so-called "National Assembly" and "government" of South Korea have been established in violation of the will of the Korean people, composed of reactionary and anti-people elements, and are pursuing the goal of permanently dividing the country and transforming South Korea into a colony of the United States. The North Korean Supreme People's Assembly, on the other hand, is elected by the vast majority of the people of North and South Korea and composed of representatives of all classes of people, and therefore it is the true representative body of the will of the entire Korean people. The task of this assembly is to approve the Korean constitution, establish a national democratic government, and guarantee the unity and independence of Korea. In conclusion, Tan expressed gratitude to the Soviet people, the Soviet army, and the people's leader, Marshal Stalin, for liberating the Korean people and assisting them in their struggle for freedom and independence. After electing the Chairman and two Vice-Chairmen of the Supreme People's Assembly, the congress adopted the agenda of the congress, which included approving the Korean constitution, electing the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, forming the Korean government, and electing the Supreme Court. On the afternoon of the same day, the congress elected a constitutional committee composed of forty-nine people and elected Kim Ko-bong, Chairman of the Presidium of the North Korean People's Assembly, as the chairman of the committee. The congress will hold its second meeting on September 4th.

　　朝鲜最高人民议会开幕
  　即将批准宪法成立全国民主政府
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社平壤三日讯：朝鲜最高人民议会于九月二日在平壤举行首次会议。到会者有南朝鲜代表三百六十名和北朝鲜代表二百十二名。会议由解放运动老战士、南朝鲜八十二岁高龄的无党无派农民谭友年（译音）致开幕词。谭氏在指出朝鲜最高人民议会的历史意义后宣称：南朝鲜的所谓“国会”及“政府”，已违反朝鲜人民意志而设立，由反动的反人民分子所组成并追求着永远分裂国家与变南朝鲜为美国殖民地的目的；而朝鲜最高人民议会联系由绝大多数南北朝鲜人民所选出，由各阶层的人民代表所组成，因此它是朝鲜全体人民意志的真正代表机关。这种议会的任务是批准朝鲜宪法，成立全国民主政府并保证朝鲜的统一与独立。谭氏最后对苏联人民、苏联军队和人民领袖斯大林元帅解放朝鲜人民并援助朝鲜人民争取自由独立的斗争表示感谢。大会在选出最高人民议会主席与两名副主席后，通过了大会的议程，其中包括批准朝鲜宪法，选举最高人民议会主席团，组成朝鲜政府，选举最高法院等。大会于当日午后选出由四十九人组成的宪法委员会，并选举北朝鲜人民议会主席团主席金科凤为委员会的主席。大会将于九月四日举行第二次会议。
