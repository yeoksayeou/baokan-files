　　Party, Government, Army, and People Unite in Struggle
  　Gao Village Successfully Rescued
    [Xinhua News Agency, North China, 17th] The Gao Village dangerous work site on the southern bank of the Yellow River in Dongming, which the people of the whole country are concerned about, has been turned from danger to safety after two months of joint and courageous repairs by the Party, government, army, and people of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area. Since the People's Liberation Army recovered Gao Village on June 19th, it has mobilized more than 45,000 civilian laborers and more than 8,000 livestock, transporting more than 200,000 bricks and more than 300 catties of willow branches, and worked hard to repair the dams and weirs destroyed by the Kuomintang army during its occupation. Just as the entire project was about to be completed, it was forced to stop because the Kuomintang bandit army reoccupied the area on July 20th. Wherever the bandit army went, it robbed materials and dug up fortifications, causing the cross-corner of the dangerous work site to collapse into the water, and the 13th and 14th dams were in danger. After the bandit army fled south on the 31st, the employees of the Yellow River Commission's River Repair Department immediately crossed the river at night to resume the emergency repair project, overcoming numerous difficulties, completing the preliminary project from the 13th dam to the 16th dam, and adding two new dams between the 14th and 15th dams. On August 9th, just as the project was completed, unexpectedly, the main flow shifted to below the 16th dam, and the riverbed was fiercely scoured by the flood, eroding 20 meters wide in one day. At this time, the emergency repair headquarters decided to build four new dams below the 16th dam. That night, the foundation of the 17th dam and the brick and willow weir had been mostly completed, but because they could not withstand the scouring of the main flow, they completely collapsed into the water, and the situation was dangerous. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office and the Yellow River Commission urgently decided that, in addition to transporting straw materials from Changyuan and Kunwu (newly established county) on the north bank to provide support, they also consulted with nearby residents and agreed to cut down green sorghum stalks and stick them to the base of the dike to rush to make more than 400 meters of revetment to protect the dike; at the same time, the back of the dike was thickened; and a ring dike was repaired between Baidian and Houchang to prevent the main dike from breaching. By the 12th, half of the 18th dam had been built, but due to continuous enemy air raids, much time was lost, causing a one-meter crack in the dam, facing the danger of breaching, and the scattered air defense civilian workers had not yet gathered. More than 100 of our cadres bravely and fearlessly transported 50,000 catties of willow branches and straw materials, and urgently repaired it, and it was stabilized in the evening. On the afternoon of the 13th, the 18th dam was almost washed away due to continuous strafing by Chiang's planes, and the danger had reached its extreme. Fortunately, all the employees risked the enemy planes' crazy strafing and desperately rescued it, and finally escaped. During our emergency repair period, Chiang's bandits carried out all kinds of sabotage. According to statistics for only ten days from July 7th to 16th, more than 150 emergency repair employees were killed or injured by enemy planes. However, thanks to the strong leadership of our democratic government and the heroic struggle of all employees, the danger was finally turned into safety. In particular, the support of the residents along the river on the north bank for the emergency repair on the south bank is an unprecedented initiative in the history of Yellow River management.

　　党政军民合力奋斗
  　高村抢险成功
    【新华社华北十七日电】全国人民所关切的黄河南岸东明高村险工，经两月来冀鲁豫解放区党政军民各方合力奋勇抢修，现已转危为安。自六月十九日解放军收复高村后，即曾动员民工四万五千余人，牲口八千余头，运砖料二十余万块，柳枝三百余斤，奋力抢修国民党军侵占时所破坏之各坝埽，正当全工将竣之际，因国民党匪军于七月廿日重占该处而被迫停工。匪军所至，到处抢工料，挖工事，致使该险工跨角坍塌入水，十三、十四两坝告急。迄三十一日匪军南窜后，我黄委会修黄处员工当即星夜南渡，恢复抢险工程，克服重重困难，完成十三坝至十六坝的初步工程，并在十四、十五坝之间加修新坝两道。至八月九日，工程刚成，不料大溜移至十六坝以下，河床被洪流凶猛淘刷，一天即淘去二十公尺宽。此时，抢险指挥部乃决定在十六坝以下添筑四道新坝。当夜十七坝坝基与砖柳埽本已完成大半，但因抗不住大溜冲刷，完全坍入水中，形势险恶。冀鲁豫行署与黄委会乃紧急决定，除由北岸长垣、昆吾（新设县）两县赶运秸料支援外，并商得附近居民同意，砍倒青高粱秆，贴堤根抢作四百余公尺长的护沿，以护大堤；同时加厚堤背；并于白店至后场间补修圈堤，以防大堤决口。至十二日，十八坝已修起一半，奈因敌机连续袭扰，误工多时，致该坝裂口一公尺，面临决口危险，而四散防空民工尚未集合，我百余干部乃奋不顾身，亲自搬运柳枝秸料五万余斤，紧急抢修，至晚始形稳住。十三日下午，又因蒋机连续扫射而误工，致十八坝几被冲跑，危险已达极点，幸赖全体员工冒敌机疯狂扫射，拼命抢救，终得脱险。在我抢险期中，蒋匪曾进行百般破坏，仅据七月七日至十六日十天统计，抢险员工死伤于匪机之下者，即达一百五十余人。然赖我民主政府之坚强领导与全体员工之英勇奋斗，终于化险为夷。尤以北岸沿河居民支援南岸抢险，更为治黄史上之创举。
