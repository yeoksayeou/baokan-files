　　Northeast Military University Sends Thousands of Cadets to the Front Lines After Graduation
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th] Thousands of cadets from the 10th graduating class of Northeast Military and Political University graduated on September 1st and have been assigned to work on the front lines. After eight months of intensive study, all the cadets have shown significant improvement in military and political affairs. During the graduation ceremony, they presented letters of determination to the leaders of the university, expressing their intention to not only be excellent commanders in their frontline positions, but also to be close comrades-in-arms with the soldiers, and to strive for the complete victory of the Liberation War.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th] A large number of medical personnel serving on the Northeast front lines and in the rear have established a new style of work and are vigorously improving their work. In order to improve work efficiency, the No. 2 Hospital of the Hejiang Military Region has established strict work discipline and systems, and regularly inspects and discusses ways to improve nursing work. Nursing care now includes scrubbing severely wounded patients once a week to prevent bedsores, as well as regularly washing the patients' feet, sweeping their beds, and exercising their limbs. When nurses are overwhelmed, the hospital's doctors also participate in carrying patients. Doctors, nurses, and wounded soldiers are closely united like a family. In a certain field hospital, soldiers not only carefully care for the wounded and sick but also automatically wash their clothes. Their enthusiasm has deeply moved many wounded and sick soldiers, who have unanimously requested their superiors to award the medical staff with meritorious service awards or to purchase gifts with disability funds to give to them. The Health Department of the Andong Military Region recently held a celebration meeting to commend more than 140 model heroes who have emerged in health work over the past year.

　　东北军大数千学员
  　毕业后赴前线工作
    【新华社东北十六日电】东北军政大学第十期数千学员已于九月一日毕业，分赴前线工作。经过八个月的紧张学习，全体学员在军事和政治上都有显著提高。在举行毕业典礼时，他们对该校首长都呈献了决心书，表示到前线工作岗位后，不但要作个优秀指挥员，并要作战士们的亲密战友，为争取解放战争的彻底胜利而奋斗。
    【新华社东北十三日电】服务于东北前线与后方的大批医务人员，树立新的工作作风，大力改进工作。合江军区医院二所为提高工作效率，建立严格的工作纪律和制度，并随时检查讨论以改进护理工作。现护理上已做到一星期给重伤病人擦洗一次，使伤病员不发生褥疮，并经常给伤病员洗脚、扫床、活动四肢等。该院医生当护士忙不过来时，还参加抬运病人，院内医生、护士、伤员都亲密团结有如家庭。某野战收容所的战士们，除细心看护伤病员外，并自动为伤员洗衣服。由于他们这种工作热忱，很多伤病员都很感动，一致要求上级给医护人员记功，或以残废金购物相赠。安东军区卫生部日前曾召开庆功大会，嘉奖了一年来在卫生工作中涌现的一百四十余位模范功臣。
