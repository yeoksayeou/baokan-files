　　Restoration of Saltpeter and Salt Industries in Yuci, Taigu, Qi, and Other Areas in Central Shanxi
　　[Central Shanxi News] Saltpeter and salt factories and workshops in the newly liberated areas of Yuci, Taigu, and Qi counties in Central Shanxi have all resumed operation with the support of the democratic government. Over two thousand workers are working hard to produce for military and civilian needs. Before and after the "July 7th" Incident, boiling saltpeter and cooking salt was one of the important sideline occupations for the people of Central Shanxi. The saltpeter and salt produced in Taigu, Qi, Xugou and other places could be sold outside the region in addition to supplying the local people. During Yan Xishan's rule, he inherited the Japanese military control methods, treating all saltpeter and salt as military supplies, monopolizing purchases, and restricting the development of saltpeter and salt. Saltpeter and salt workers in various places suffered greatly from exploitation. In Qi County, each saltpeter pot had to deliver 100 jin of pure saltpeter per month, but the price given by Yan's official price was 20,000 yuan per jin, which could only be exchanged for five or six liang of white flour. The workers had to work for Yan while going hungry. The workers could not make a living, so they tried to produce more salt and less saltpeter to earn wages to supplement their income, but they were also subjected to various exorbitant taxes and levies by Yan, and if they did not produce enough saltpeter, they would be beaten and punished. Therefore, many owners of saltpeter and salt factories buried their boilers and fled to the Taihang Mountains. After the liberation of the Central Shanxi Plain, the democratic government immediately helped the saltpeter workshop workers solve the problems of production materials and transportation and sales difficulties, and now they have all resumed work. There are two types of saltpeter workshops: worker partnerships and hired workers. The Saltpeter and Salt Bureau of the Taihang Second Military Sub-district recently sent people to Qi and Taigu counties to provide specific guidance. According to needs, the government issued loans of 7 million yuan to Taigu and Yuci counties to solve current difficulties, and set appropriate prices to help solve the problem of finished product sales. The Qi County Democratic Government is preparing to assist the Saltpeter Mine Bureau in establishing a saltpeter worker grain store to ensure the supply of grain to the saltpeter workers. The saltpeter workshop workers in Xugou heard about this and came to ask the democratic government for help. At present, many salt boiling workshops have been established in the Taigu and Qi County Saltpeter Mine Bureau, and special personnel have been sent to provide technical guidance to improve the quality of finished products. According to a survey by the Qi County Saltpeter Industry Association, each pot produces an average of 400 jin of saltpeter and more than 300 jin of salt per month. The total monthly output of saltpeter in the county can exceed 20,000 jin, and the net monthly income of the county can be around 200,000 jin of millet, with a monthly profit of 50 million yuan.

　　晋中榆、太、祁等地
  　硝盐业全部恢复
    【晋中讯】晋中新解放区榆次、太谷、祁县等地硝盐工厂、作坊，经民主政府扶植，已全部复业。二千余工人正为军需民食而努力生产。“七七”事变前后，熬硝煮盐原为晋中人民重要副业之一，太谷、祁县、徐沟等地所产硝盐，除供给本地人民食用外，尚可外运。阎锡山统治时期，继承日寇军管统治办法，将所有硝盐全部当作军用品，统治采买，限制硝盐发展。各地硝盐工人备受压榨。祁县每口硝锅，每月得交一百斤净硝，但按阎匪官价给价，一斤硝二万元，只能干折五六两白面。工人们只得饿着肚皮给阎匪干活，工人们顾不住生活，想法多出盐，少出硝，挣工钱来补，但也遭到阎匪各种苛捐杂税的剥削，上不够硝，还得挨打受罚。因此，不少盐硝厂主人把锅炉埋了，逃亡到太行山里。晋中平原解放后，民主政府立即帮助硝坊工人解决生产资料以及运销困难，现已全部复工。硝坊有工人碰股和雇佣工人两种，太行二分区硝盐局日前又派人到祁县、太谷各地进行具体指导。政府根据需要，对太谷、榆次两县发放贷款七百万元，以解决当前困难，并订出适当价格，帮助解决成品销售问题。祁县民主政府准备协助硝矿局成立硝工粮店，保证硝工粮食供给。徐沟硝坊工人听说，都找来要求民主政府帮助。现太谷、祁县硝矿局，业已成立不少熬盐作坊，并已派专人作技术指导，以提高成品质量。据祁县硝业会调查，每口锅每月平均出硝四百斤，出盐三百余斤，总计全县每月出硝可超过两万斤，全县每月可净收小米二十万斤上下，每月可取利五千万元。
