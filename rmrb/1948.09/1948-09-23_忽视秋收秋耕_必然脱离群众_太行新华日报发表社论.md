　　Neglecting Autumn Harvest and Autumn Planting
  　Inevitably Leads to Detachment from the Masses
  　Taihang Xinhua Daily Publishes Editorial
    [Taihang Electric] Since the Taihang District Party Committee convened a meeting of cadres above the county level in August, the leadership of autumn harvest and autumn planting has been generally neglected in the execution of this year's autumn and winter work guidelines in various parts of Taihang. The Xinhua Daily here has published an editorial on this matter. The editorial points out that in early August, the District Party Committee convened a meeting of cadres above the county level to determine the work guidelines for this autumn and winter, mainly to conclude land reform, rectify the Party and build political power, develop production, and support the front lines. In terms of specific steps, after cadres went to the countryside, the first thing was to lead the autumn harvest and autumn planting, rectify cooperatives, and at the same time conduct investigations and research to prepare for the conclusion of land reform and the conduct of Party rectification. However, judging from the situation in various counties since the August meeting, apart from some counties that correctly implemented the work guidelines of the District Party Committee and determined correct specific methods, many counties have deviations. The performance in the implementation of the policy is generally focused on concluding land reform and rectifying the Party and building political power, and only made general calls for autumn harvest and autumn planting, without specific organizational arrangements, and some even did not mention it at all. Some counties deployed and discussed the resolutions of the August meeting using an egalitarian approach, without making specific arrangements based on the specific circumstances of the county and the priorities in the work. In the work arrangements before autumn, in order to buy time to end the land reform, many counties relatively neglected or even abandoned the leadership of the autumn harvest and autumn planting. In addition to checking the reasons for not correctly implementing the policy of the District Party Committee, the leaders of various counties should also recall the experience and lessons learned from abandoning the leadership of spring plowing and production during the land reform and Party rectification experiment this spring.
    In order to correct this deviation in a timely manner, the simple task viewpoint and the phenomenon of impetuosity in ending land reform must be overcome ideologically. We must deeply understand the first item of the Central Committee's instructions on land reform and Party rectification work in 1948: "Must pay attention to the season." The six characters, "must pay attention to the season," if the current autumn harvest and autumn planting are affected by the end of land reform, it must be detached from the masses, causing great obstacles to future work. Those who believe that autumn harvest and autumn planting do not need leadership and that the masses will naturally do it should recognize that if autumn harvest and autumn planting, especially autumn planting, are not done well, it will be a serious harm to next year's large-scale production campaign. Therefore, all localities should put their cadre strength into leading production and shorten the time for autumn harvest and autumn planting; at the same time, conduct investigations and research, discover problems, and widely and correctly publicize the policies of ending land reform and democratic Party rectification, and dispel the ideological doubts of cadres and the masses. If this preparatory work is done well, after the victorious conclusion of autumn harvest and autumn planting, the conclusion of land reform and Party rectification will be carried out smoothly and universally.

　　忽视秋收秋耕
  　必然脱离群众
  　太行新华日报发表社论
    【太行电】太行各地自八月区党委召开县以上干部会议后，在执行今年秋冬工作方针上，普遍忽视秋收秋耕的领导。此间新华日报特为此发表社论。指出：八月上旬区党委召开县以上干部会议，确定今年秋冬工作方针，主要为结束土改、整党建政、发展生产、支援前线。在具体步骤上，干部下乡后，第一件事就是领导秋收秋耕，整顿合作社，同时调查研究准备结束土改与进行整党。但从八月会议后各县情况看，除有些县份正确的贯彻了区党委的工作方针，确定了正确的具体作法以外，不少县份存有偏差。表现在对方针的贯彻上一般是着重了结束土改和整党建政，对秋收秋耕只作了一般的号召，没有进行具体的组织布置，有的甚至根本没有提。有的是将八月会议的决议用平均主义的办法去布置与讨论，没有根据县的具体情况和工作中的轻重缓急去具体安排。很多县份在秋前的工作布置上，为了争取时间结束土改，对秋收秋耕便相对的忽视了甚至放弃领导。这种做法，各县领导上除应检查没有正确的贯彻区党委的方针的原因外，并应回忆今春在土改整党实验中，放弃春耕生产领导的经验教训。
    为了及时纠正这种偏向，在思想上必须克服结束土改中的单纯任务观点与急性病现象，要深刻领会中央关于一九四八年土改整党工作指示的第一项“必须注意季节”六个字，如因结束土改而影响了当前秋收秋耕，必须脱离群众，给今后工作造成很大的阻碍。认为秋收秋耕不用领导，群众自然会做的自流论者，要认识秋收秋耕特别是秋耕搞不好，对明年大生产运动将是个严重的危害。因此各地应把干部力量放到领导生产上来，缩短秋收秋耕的时间；同时进行调查研究，发现问题，广泛的正确宣传结束土改民主整党等政策，解除干部群众的思想疑问，这个准备工作做好，秋收秋耕胜利结束之后，即会顺利的普遍进行结束土改与整党建政。
