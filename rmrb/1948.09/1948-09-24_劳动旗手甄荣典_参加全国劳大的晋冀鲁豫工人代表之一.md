Labor Flag-bearer Zhen Rongdian
—One of the Workers' Representatives from Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Attending the National Labor Congress

	Comrade Zhen Rongdian earned the glorious title of "Shell King" during the most difficult period of the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines in the Taihang Mountains. Six years later, he is attending the Sixth National Labor Congress with the honor of being a labor flag-bearer from Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu.

	In 1940, during the Hundred Regiments Offensive that shook the Japanese invaders, the Eighth Route Army's self-made grenade launchers appeared, shocking the Japanese. Okamura Neji exclaimed that the Eighth Route Army had "large-scale, modern military industry." In fact, those were the products of the Huangyandong Arsenal, where "Shell King" Zhen Rongdian began his apprenticeship. There, mountain stream water was the basic power, railway tracks from the enemy-occupied areas were the only source of steel, and the belts were woven from hemp rope. Ten hours of labor a day, constantly repeating simple movements, requiring every second for both hands to exert all their strength—turning the outer circle of artillery shells was a simple, heavy physical labor that offered no technical skills. Others said, "Your body can't take it, there's no progress." But Zhen Rongdian said, "As long as it benefits the front lines, I'll keep doing it." A high sense of responsibility made him persevere for five years. In just two years, he went from an ordinary apprentice to a special-class labor hero who caused a sensation throughout the entire border region.

	In 1942, the anti-mopping-up war in Taihang reached its cruelest point, and the higher authorities called for a new worker movement to support the front lines. Zhen Rongdian suggested, "If the superiors set the plan, the workers always feel that it's the superiors' business, and they can't be blamed if they don't complete it; if they set their own plan, they always feel it's their own responsibility if they don't complete it, and they have to find a way." The plan he set played a leading role in the movement. The output increased from dozens of shells per person per day to one hundred, two hundred... Eventually, general skilled workers reached more than three hundred, and Zhen Rongdian created a record of four hundred and eighty, with each shell averaging only seventy-five seconds, earning the glorious title of "Shell King." As a result, the entire factory's production more than doubled.

	During the war, Comrade Zhen Rongdian always took the lead. For five full years, he never left his "Six-Five" rifle. New Year's, spring plowing, wheat harvest, autumn harvest, every destructive mopping-up operation targeted the military industry department as its main goal. The enemy often used overwhelming force, using "netting" and "combing" tactics to enter the deep, uninhabited mountains. In the winter of 1940, more than a thousand manual workers, along with their families, the old, and the weak, encountered the enemy when they moved to Hualong Mountain. Zhen Rongdian stepped forward and led twenty-three worker self-defense team members, with twenty-three rifles, to fight the enemy searching the mountains. After three difficult days, he finally protected all the workers with the blood of more than ten self-defense team members and rushed out of the chaotic mountain ridges between the two enemy forces.

	After the anti-mopping-up operation ended and he returned to Huangyandong, the painstakingly managed factory was in ruins. A few workers became pessimistic: "What's the point of doing anything!" Zhen Rongdian was a Communist Party member. He said, "That's how the revolution is. There's no place in the liberated area that the enemy can't reach, but there's also no place for the enemy to stand. The enemy has been driven out no matter how fierce they are, so what if the factory building is burned down? We'll rebuild it and keep working!" The forty-day resumption plan was completed in twenty days. After that, every time there was an anti-mopping-up operation, they simply regarded repairing the factory as a necessary part of producing shells.

	Zhen Rongdian often said, "Machines are our two hands. Without hands, we become useless." In order not to lose the machines, he often walked three to five miles outside the factory after extremely tiring work to choose a good place to bury the machines, and carefully memorized the nearby landmarks, measuring the direction and distance, as precisely as he turned shells. Burying the most valuable machines in the factory was especially difficult. Every time he went out, it was either uphill or downhill, and thousands of pounds of iron had to be carried by people for several miles. In order to keep the secret, the machines carried by eight people were carried by four people, and he would carry several trips in one night. After finishing, he had to bury his own tools. This super-physical labor caused Zhen Rongdian to suffer internal injuries, and he suffered from bronchitis every winter.

	During the May mopping-up operation in 1942, the enemy deployed so many troops that they could encircle the entire Taihang area hand in hand. The enemy's mopping-up teams searched the mountain slopes from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain every day, and then searched from the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain like a net. The excavation teams searching for machines dug "three feet into the ground," and dug the nearby ground into a mess. In order to protect the workers, the factory director ordered all the workers to move to a distance, but Zhen Rongdian was reluctant to leave. He and several self-defense team members stayed in the mopping-up circle, often only a mile and a half away from the enemy. Whenever the excavation team approached the location where the machine was buried, they would shoot at the enemy, attract the mopping-up team to the mountains, and play "hide-and-seek" with the Japanese invaders with their lives.

	In 1945, the new "Eighty-Two" shell factory was established. No one was idle, even if no goods were shipped. The superiors thought of Zhen Rongdian and transferred him to make "Eighty-Two" artillery shells. Under the attention of the entire factory, when he was still a beginner, he made forty-five on his first day of work. But what he was most concerned about was how to improve everyone's output. Every day after work, he would chat with the workers, ask about their difficulties, and break through their minds about the old social habit that apprentices dared not exceed their masters in output. He said, "This is wrong. This is a work that requires strength. We can't compare with the master in skills, but the young people should run ahead in strength. When have you ever heard of a top student, but never heard of a top teacher." On the one hand, he also asked the old masters for technical advice. He was a craftsman who taught apprentices in terms of skills, but he often did chores such as carrying water and sweeping the floor. Even people who initially had prejudices against him were united around him. Half a month later, Zhen Rongdian increased from forty-five to eighty every day, and other workers also increased to fifty. Everyone elected him as the chairman of the labor union.

	In October, good news of the great counter-offensive was frequently reported. The front lines needed shells more and more urgently. Zhen Rongdian used all his spare time to find ways to transform tools, and even created an astonishing speed of one hundred and thirty-five per day (ten hours). But this number was still far from enough, so he extended his working hours. He didn't relax for three consecutive months, and even continued to work after two of his toes were crushed. The selfless labor, like a fully powered locomotive, drove up the output of the entire factory and caught up with the needs of the front lines. On the Handan front line, the first beautiful battle to wipe out Chiang Kai-shek's invading army on the front line was launched at this time.

	Victory followed victory. Batch after batch of machines were transported back to the rear. Zhen Rongdian was transferred to the newly established machine factory in the spring of 1947. The machines that had never been seen before were piled up in a mess, and many of them were "broken arms and legs." Zhen Rongdian said, "It's no good if we have machines but don't know how to use them!" He tried to install them one by one. If he didn't understand, he would ask experienced workers for advice. He drew pictures of the missing parts and asked people to repair and match them. He often worked more than fourteen hours a day, and finally assembled all of them. He also launched a vigorous processing assault with the great craftsmen of the machine workshop, making the machines run non-stop for twenty-four hours. The "Shell King," who had been doing simple labor for six years, now ran to the front in the complex and technical work, setting off a heroic labor throughout the factory and manufacturing a batch of machines for manufacturing military supplies. At the same time, the factory's "Shell Donation Movement" was also successfully completed. They used voluntary work and donations of money and goods to arm a company of Liu Bocheng's meritorious troops. After the all-out offensive of the People's Liberation Army began, they continuously used voluntary work to create brand-new cannons, inspiring Liu Deng's army to move south to the Central Plains.

	★　　　　　　★　　　　　　★

	Since being elected as a special-class labor hero in 1942, Zhen Rongdian has always stood at the forefront of the three Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Hero Conferences and has become a recognized labor flag-bearer. But on the road of the hero's career, he suffered enough for no reason. Disgruntled workers said, "It's enough to have a hero, what's the point of us doing anything?" Backward workers watched coldly and said, "Let the hero 'move,' we can't be heroes, and we won't 'move'." But he didn't care, he was still patient in approaching others, examining himself, and said, "If it weren't for everyone's efforts, I wouldn't be able to become a hero. Everyone is a real hero, I'm just a representative cultivated by everyone." He deeply understood the famous saying "Hero's career, mass style." No matter where he worked, he always humbly and seriously learned from the masses and constantly improved himself. Even when he attended the National Labor Congress in Harbin, he still paid attention to learning new technologies whenever he had time. He said, "The revolution is getting bigger and bigger, and there are many machines that I haven't seen before. I'm not afraid of not having used them, I'm afraid of not learning. As long as we twist into a force with the masses, everything can be done well!"

	Selfless and always moving forward, this is the true color of a hero, and Zhen Rongdian, this thirty-one-year-old labor flag-bearer, speaks so humbly, simply, and full of confidence.

	Zhen Rongdian is from Tang County, Hebei Province, the son of a poor peasant. He worked hard on the Yuehan Road at the age of seventeen and has experienced the hardships of society. He has a high degree of class consciousness.

　　劳动旗手甄荣典
    —参加全国劳大的晋冀鲁豫工人代表之一
    甄荣典同志荣获“炮弹大王”这光荣称号，还是在太行山敌后抗日战争最艰苦的时候。六年后的今天，他又带着晋冀鲁豫工人旗手的荣誉，出席全国第六次劳动大会。
    一九四○年，震动日寇的百团大战中，出现了八路军自造的掷弹筒，骇倒了日寇，冈村宁次惊呼八路军有了“规模宏大的现代化军事工业”。其实，那就是“炮弹王”甄荣典开始其学徒生活的黄烟洞兵工厂的产品。在那里，山涧流水是基本动力，敌占区的铁路轨是钢的唯一来源，轮带是自己用麻绳织成的。一天十小时的劳动，不间断的重复着简单的动作以每秒钟双手都得使上浑身力气——旋车炮弹外圆是一种最苦重而又学不到什么技术的单纯体力劳动。旁人说：“身体吃不消，没进步。”甄荣典却说：“只要对前线有利，我就干下去。”高度责任心使他坚持了五年。他在短短的两年中，从一个普通的学徒变成轰动全边区的特等劳动英雄。
    一九四二年，太行反扫荡战争到了残酷的顶点，上级号召展开支援前线的新劳动者运动。甄荣典提意见说：“上级给订计划，工友们总觉那是上级的事，完不成可怪不了咱；要是自己订的计划，完不成总感到是自己的责任，怎的也得想出个办法。”他订的计划，在运动中起了带头作用。从每天每人几十发炮弹提高到一百发、二百发…………最后一般熟练工人高到三百多发，而甄荣典创造了四百八十发的最高纪录，每发平均只需七十五秒钟，荣获“炮弹大王”光荣称号。全厂生产，因而超过一倍以上。
    在战争中，甄荣典同志也总是走在头里。整整五年从没离开过他的“六五”步枪，年关、春耕、麦收、秋收，每一次的毁灭性的清剿都以军工部为其主要目标，敌人经常以压倒优势兵力，用“拉网”“梳篦”战术打进人迹罕到的大山里。四○年冬，一千多徒手工人连带家属老弱，转移到华龙山时遭遇了敌人，甄荣典挺身而出，带领二十三个工人自卫队员、二十三支步枪，和搜山的敌人搏斗，经过艰难的三天，终于以十多个自卫队员的热血掩护了全体工人，从两股敌人之间的乱山梁上冲了出去。
    反扫荡结束后回到黄烟洞，苦心经营的工厂成了废墟。少数工人悲观起来：“这还有啥干的！”甄荣典是共产党员，他说：“革命就是这样，解放区没有敌人到不了的地方，可也没一处地方让敌人站住脚。敌人再凶也打出去了，烧掉厂房算啥？盖了再干！”四十天的复工计划在二十天中全部完成。此后每次反扫荡，他们干脆把修复工厂看做生产炮弹的必经过程之一。
    甄荣典常说：“机器就是我们的两只手，没了手咱就成了废人了。”为了不丢掉的机器，他常在工作极度疲劳之后，走到工厂三五里外，选择埋藏机器的好地方，并且细心牢记附近的目标，量好方向距离，如同车炮弹一样精确。埋藏厂中最贵重的机器尤其困难，一出门不是上坡就是下坡，几千斤铁得用人抬几里地，为了保守秘密，八个人抬的机器四个人就架着走了，一个晚上扛他几趟，完了还要埋藏自己的工具，超体力劳动使甄荣典受了内伤，每年冬天就闹气管炎。
    四二年的五月大扫荡，敌人出动的兵力，手拉手可以把太行区围上一圈。敌人清剿队每天围着山脚搜到山顶，又从山顶撒网一样搜到山脚，寻找机器的挖掘队，“入土三尺”，把附近地皮掏的稀烂。为了保全工人，厂长命令所有工人一律向远处转移，但甄荣典舍不得走开，和几个自卫队员留在清剿圈里，经常只离敌人一里半里，每当挖掘队走近埋藏机器的位置，他们就向敌人射击，把清剿队吸引上山，用生命和日寇捉起“迷藏”来。
    四五年，新成立“八二”炮弹厂，谁也没有闲着，就是不出货，上级想到甄荣典，调他来，造“八二”大炮弹，在他还是初试，全厂瞩目下，他上工第一天就做了四十五个。但他最关心的还是如何提高大家产量，每天下工后，就和工人闲谈，问他们的困难，学徒产量不敢超过师父这是旧社会的恶习，他就打通他们思想说：“这话说岔了，这是用力气的活，比技术咱比不过师父，比力气年轻人就该跑到头里。什么时候只听说状元徒弟，那有说状元师傅的。”一面他又到老师父跟前请教技术。论技术是带徒弟的工匠了，但他常做挑水、扫地等杂活，连起初对他有成见的人都团结到他周围了。半个月后甄荣典每天由四十五增到八十个，旁的工人也提高到五十个。大家选他当了工会主任。
    十月，大反攻捷报频传，前线需要炮弹愈益迫切，甄荣典利用一切空隙时间，又想法改造工具，竟创造了每天（十小时）一百三十五个的惊人速度。但这数字还是差得远，他便将工作时间延长，一连三个月没松劲，甚至脚趾被砸碎两只后，包住伤口还是继续工作。奋不顾身的劳动，就象开足马力的火车头，把全厂的产量带起来，追上了前线的需要。而在邯郸前线，上了前线，全歼蒋介石进犯军的第一次漂亮仗就在这时打响了。
    胜利接着胜利，一批批机器运回后方，甄荣典在四七年春天调到新成立的机器厂。从未见过的机器乱堆在一起，不少都是“断胳膊缺腿”的。甄荣典说：“有了机器不会用还行！”一件件试着按装，不懂的就请教有经验的工人，欠缺的机件自己画图找人修配，每天经常工作十四小时以上，终于全部装配好了。并且和机工所的大工匠们，发动了轰轰烈烈的加工突击，使机器二十四小时不息转动。六年来一直做着简单劳动的“炮弹王”，现在做起技术复杂的细工，一样跑到头里，掀起了全厂英雄劳动，制造出一批制造军火的机器来。和这同时，全厂的“献炮运动”也胜利完成，他们用义务工和献金献物，给刘伯承有功部队武装一个连。解放军全面进攻开始后，他们又不断的用义务工造出全新的大炮，鼓舞着南下中原的刘邓大军。
    ★　　　　　　★　　　　　　★
    从一九四二年当选特等劳动英雄起，甄荣典在晋冀鲁豫三届群英大会中，始终站在前列，已成为公认的劳动旗手了。但在英雄的事业道路上，无端的打击折磨就够他受的，不服气的工人说：“有英雄就行啦，咱还干个啥劲？”落后的工人冷眼看着说：“让英雄‘运动’去吧，咱当不了英雄，咱也不‘运动’。”但他毫不计较，还是耐心的接近别人、检讨自己，并且说：“要是没有大家努力，我也当不了英雄，大家都是真正的英雄，我不过是大家培养出来的代表吧了。”他深深体会了“英雄事业，群众作风”的名言，无论到哪里工作，总是向群众虚心认真学习，不断提高自己，就在他出席哈尔滨全国工代的时候，一有空还注意学习新的技术。他说：“革命越闹越大啦，没见过的机器多着哩。不怕没用过，就怕不学习。只要和群众扭成一股劲，啥事情都能办好了！”
    奋不顾身，永远前进，这正是英雄的本色，而甄荣典，这个三十一岁的劳动旗手，说起话来又是那样虚心、朴素、闪烁着信心。
    甄荣典河北唐县人，贫农的儿子，十七岁就在粤汉路做苦工，在社会饱经风霜，他有着高度的阶级的觉悟。
