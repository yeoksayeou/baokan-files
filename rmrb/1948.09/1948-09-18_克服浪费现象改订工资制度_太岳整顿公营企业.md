Taiyue Telegram: To implement the resolutions of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, the Taiyue District convened an industry and commerce conference from August 4th to 30th. A total of 110 representatives attended the meeting, including 13 representatives from private industry and commerce. The meeting enthusiastically discussed the summary report of Comrade Bo Yibo of the North China Central Bureau. In addition to conducting necessary research on the development of private industry and commerce, the meeting focused on examining the operational management, wage system, worker welfare, and other issues in the leadership of Taiyue's public enterprises. The meeting first pointed out the achievements of Taiyue's public enterprises in construction. For example, the match factory was built in three months under extremely difficult conditions, and its output has continuously increased. It can now produce 20 large boxes of matches per day. The spinning mill could not start up due to a lack of carding machines. Later, engineer Li Maoxuan trial-produced a drafting machine, and now it can produce 60 jin of fine yarn per day. Other departments, such as the clothing factory and military factory under the military supply department, have also guaranteed the army's supply under extremely difficult conditions. On the other hand, the meeting severely criticized the serious shortcomings in the operational management of public enterprises: First, serious waste and anarchic indiscipline. For example, in selecting a site for the Kejing Coal Mine, no careful investigation, research, or measurement was conducted. The mine entrance was opened at the junction of two mountains, and after only one month of mining, all twelve mine tunnels were damaged, with an estimated loss of 100 million yuan. This kind of phenomenon was very common in public enterprises in the past. The meeting stipulated that in the future, the establishment of factories, relocation of factories, and mining operations must undergo detailed investigation and measurement, and plans must be drafted based on market sales and other conditions, signed by engineers, and submitted to higher authorities for approval before they can be implemented. The meeting also strictly enforced the planning of the production process and ensured that each employee can consciously complete their plan. If unexpected difficulties are encountered and the plan cannot be completed on time, the superior must be notified in a timely manner. If no notification is made and the plan is not completed, the factory director will be held responsible. Second, the organizational structure is bloated, turning the factory into an "office" and "militarized." According to statistics from the 60 factories present at the meeting, non-production and redundant personnel accounted for 40.96% of the total number of employees. Among them, the redundant and non-production personnel in manufacturing plants accounted for 38% of the total number of employees in the factory. A certain factory under the military supply department did not focus on production, but simply emphasized political work, turning the factory into a barracks, with collective speeches every morning and frequent meetings, which affected production. The meeting decided that the inventory of factory property and adjustment of organizational structures will begin in September. In the future, each factory will strive not to employ an incompetent employee. Third, labor, technology, tools, and raw materials were not organized in a planned manner, resulting in serious losses, destruction, and waste. For example, in order to use pig iron, a manufacturing plant cut the iron axles of trains into several sections. When the spinning mill was established, it recruited many apprentices, thinking that apprentices were easy to lead, ideologically pure, and had low wages. However, due to their low skills, they damaged more than 1,000 jin of cotton while spinning a total of 300 jin of yarn in the first two months. These phenomena are stumbling blocks that hinder public factories from improving production and moving towards enterprise management. In the future, the organization of labor, technology, tools, and raw materials must be strengthened to achieve the goal of increasing production and reducing costs. In addition, the meeting also examined the current wage system in public enterprises, which also violated the principle of developing production. There were two extremely unreasonable manifestations: First, wages were determined not based on production technology and contributions to actual production, but according to class origin. Therefore, the wage system was egalitarian, which greatly affected the improvement of production technology. Second, the phenomenon of mismatch between grades and skills was common in various public enterprises. The main reason was that there was no skill assessment system in the past. Grades were determined not based on skills, but based on the length of working time, the degree of personal difficulty, and the number of family members. Therefore, people with high skills were dissatisfied, which reduced production efficiency. The meeting sharply criticized this egalitarian and purely relief-oriented view and decided to determine wages based on the skill level of production technology and the contribution to actual production. There should be a regular skill assessment system. Any worker whose skills have improved can have their grade raised. It was also decided to organize worker welfare undertakings, mainly by organizing production cooperation and organizing the production of workers' families.

　　克服浪费现象改订工资制度
  　太岳整顿公营企业
    【太岳电】为贯彻执行华北工商业会议的决议，八月四日至三十日，太岳区召开了工商业会议。出席会议的代表共一百一十位，其中有私营工商代表十三位。会上热烈讨论了华北中央局薄一波同志的总结报告。除对私营工商业的发展问题作了必要的研究外，着重检查了太岳公营企业领导中的经营管理、工资制度、工人福利等问题。首先指出太岳公营企业在建设中的成绩。如：火柴厂能在极端困难的条件下三个月建设起来，产量不断提高，现在每日能产二十大箱火柴。纺纱厂机器中因缺少梳棉机不能开工，后来李茂轩工程师试制了拉条机，现在每日能产六十斤细纱。其他如军供部门的被服厂、军工厂也都在极端困难的条件下保证了军队的供给等等。另一方面严格批评了公营企业经营管理中的严重缺点：第一、严重的浪费和无政府无纪律现象。如磕井煤矿在选择地区上，没有经过慎重调查研究和测量，把窑口开到两座山的接合部，只下了一个月煤，十二个煤洞就都坏了，估计损失一亿元。这类现象在过去公营企业中是很普遍的。会议规定今后设厂、移厂、开采矿山，必须经过详细调查测量、根据市场销路等条件拟订计划，经过工程师签字，送交上级批准，然后才可实行。并严格生产过程中的计划性，并使每个职工能够自觉完成自己的计划。如发现意外困难无法按期完成计划时，应及时向上级声明，如不声明，又完不成计划，厂长要负责任。第二、组织机构庞大，把工厂“机关化”“军队化”了。据到会的六十个工厂统计：非生产及多余人员占总人数百分之四十点九六，其中制造厂的多余人员和非生产人员竟占到全厂人数百分之三十八。军供部门某厂不从生产着眼，单纯强调政治工作，把工厂变成兵营，每天早晨集体训话，开会又多，影响生产。会议决定九月份要开始清理厂内财产，调整机构。今后各厂力求不用一个不称职的员工。第三、没有把劳力技术、工具、原料有计划的组织起来，造成严重的损失破坏浪费现象。如制造厂为了要用元铁，把火车上的铁轴截成几节。纺纱厂开办时吸收学徒多，总以为学徒好领导，思想纯洁，工资低。但因技术低，在初创的两个月共纺三百斤纱，就损坏了一千多斤棉花。这些现象是障碍公营工厂提高生产、走向企业化的绊脚石。今后必须加强劳力、技术、工具、原料使用的组织性，作到提高生产、减低成本的目的。另外又检查出公营企业中现行的工资制度，也违背了发展生产的原则。有两种极不合理的表现：一、规定工资不是根据生产技术和对实际生产的贡献，而是按照成份出身，因此工资制度是平均主义的。这就大大影响了生产技术的提高。第二、各公营企业中普遍发生等级和技术不符合的现象，主要原因是过去没有考工制度，不看技术只看工作时间长短及个人困难程度、人口多少等划分等级，因此技术高的人不满，降低了生产效率。会议尖锐的批评了这种平均主义、单纯的救济观点，决定按生产技术的熟练程度和在实际生产上的贡献来决定工资。要有定期的考工制度。任何工人技术有了提高，等级就可以提高。又确定举办工人福利事业，主要靠组织生产合作，组织工人家属生产来解决。
