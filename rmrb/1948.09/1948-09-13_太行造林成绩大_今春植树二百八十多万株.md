　　Great Achievements in Afforestation in Taihang
  　More Than 2.8 Million Trees Planted This Spring
    [Taihang Telegram] The afforestation and construction work in the Taihang area, under the active leadership, support, and encouragement of our democratic government, is gradually expanding in scale and development. In 1946, twelve counties planted a total of more than 2.03 million trees, three counties restored 714 "forbidden mountains," and seven counties established 395 nurseries. In 1947, incomplete statistics from fifteen counties and cities showed that more than 1.5 million trees were planted, averaging more than five trees per person. This year's three-month spring afforestation campaign, drawing on past experience and adopting the guiding principle of universal mobilization and focused promotion, has achieved greater success than any previous year. According to statistics from twelve counties and cities including Xingtai, and six hundred and thirty villages in ten counties including Lucheng and Zanhuang, and both sides of the Handan-Changzhi Highway and the Qin River: a total of more than 2,276,000 timber trees and more than 565,000 fruit trees were planted. The total number of trees planted this spring is more than 2,842,000. Some areas have also carried out tree protection, pruning, and grafting work. Lingchuan County alone pruned more than 73,000 trees. Two districts in Pingshun grafted more than 6,700 timber trees. Secondly, various places have restored and established "forbidden mountains" and "forbidden forests." The total area of Songshan Mountain in Heshun County is about 150,000 mu, directly led by the county, and a management system of nearly 10,000 mu has been established. Xiangyuan and Wuxiang restored 1,675.9 mu of "forbidden mountains." In Lai County, a management system has been established for 150 mountain forests. In the Changzhi and Yincheng area, a forest area of about fifteen li, and the Xishan forest area in Xigou, Lingchuan, and man-made pine and cypress trees have all restored forest protection management.
    In order to build a long-term afforestation foundation and solve the problem of tree seedling shortage in afforestation, various places have also established a large number of nurseries in recent years. The Guancun Nursery of the Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has supplied more than 46,850 tree seedlings of various kinds to counties such as Licheng, Lucheng, Pingshun, Huguan, and Changzhi, as well as the Handan-Changzhi Highway. The Kangzhuang Nursery of the Xingtai Agricultural and Forestry Bureau supplied tens of thousands of cypress seedlings to the masses. The nurseries in Dalian South, ＠ North, and Ganquan villages in Pingshun supplied 11,895 tree seedlings, accounting for 48.9% of the total tree seedling source of the three villages. The private nursery of labor hero Liu Jubao in Lucheng supplied more than 2,000 seedlings to the masses. In addition, various places have also discovered and utilized a large number of natural nurseries. For example, in the Shahe Beach Forest Area, twenty-six villages, nine of which discovered more than 1,740 mu of natural nursery seedlings, ranging from one and a half feet to five feet in height. This spring, Yushe and Heshun counties established ninety new village nurseries. She County and Lin County established more than 2,400 mu. The discovery, establishment, and renovation of a large number of nurseries have laid a favorable foundation for future afforestation. During this spring's afforestation campaign, attention was also paid to forest protection work, and many areas established forest protection organizations and systems. For example, in Hengling Village, Heshun, a dedicated person is responsible, and the masses take turns providing meals. There has been no loss of a single tree for three or four years. Yushe pays attention to organizing cattle, sheep, workers, and children to participate in the forest management committee, and also organizes the use of manure and red mud to smear the trees to prevent sheep from eating them. The management method for tree planting on the Handan-Changzhi Road adopts tree tagging, barbed wire fencing, regular watering, and replanting as soon as trees die. Various places have also stipulated compensation and punishment methods, stimulating the enthusiasm of the masses for forest protection.

　　太行造林成绩大
  　今春植树二百八十多万株
    【太行电】太行区的植树造林建设工作，经过我民主政府的积极领导与扶助奖励，其规模与成绩逐渐在扩大与发展中。一九四六年十二个县共植树二百零三万多株，三个县恢复禁山七百一十四设，七个县建立苗圃三百九十五处。一九四七年十五个县市的不完全统计，共植树一百五十余万株，每人平均五株以上。今年三个月的春季植树造林运动，接受以往经验，采取普遍号召重点推动的指导方针，取得了超过以往任何一年的巨大成绩。根据邢台等十二个县市，及潞城赞皇等十个县六百三十个村，和邯长公路两旁、沁河两岸等的统计：共栽木材树二百廿七万六千多株，栽果木树五十六万五千多株。总计今春植树二百八十四万二千多株。有些地区并进行了保树修树接木工作，陵川一个县，即修树七万三千多株。平顺两个区接材木树六千七百多株。其次各地并恢复和建立了禁山、禁林。和顺全县松山总面积在十五万亩左右，由县直接领导，建立了近万亩的管理制度。襄垣，武乡恢复禁山一千六百七十五亩九分。涞县一百五十处山林，已建立了管理制度。长治、荫城一带，长约十五里面积之山林，及陵川西沟的西山林区，及人造松柏，均恢复了护林管理。
    为建设长期植树造林基础，解决植树造林中的树秧困难，数年来各地并大量建立了苗圃，长治农林局的关村苗圃，供给黎城、潞城、平顺、壶关、长治等各县及邯长公路的各种树秧即达四万六千八百五十余株。邢台农林局的康庄苗圃，供给群众只柏树秧即数万株，平顺大梁南、＠北、甘泉三村的苗圃供树秧一万一千八百九十五株。占该三村全部树秧来源百分之四十八·九。潞城劳动英雄刘巨宝的私人苗圃供给群众植秧两千多株，此外各地并大量的发现与利用天然苗圃，如沙河滩林区，二十六个村，即有九个村发现一千七百四十余亩天然铺场苗秧，高达一尺半至五尺。今春新建立的村苗圃榆社、和顺两县即有九十处。涉县林县两县建立了二千四百余亩，大量苗圃的发现、建立与修整，对今后植树造林打下了有利的基础。今春的植树造林运动中，同时注意了护林工作，不少地区建立了护林组织与制度。如和顺横岭村，确定一个专人负责，群众轮流管饭，现已有三四年没有损失一棵树，榆社注意组织牛羊工儿童参加林木管理委员会，又组织用粪和红泥土抹树以免羊腊。邯长路植树管理的办法，采用树木挂牌，围圪针，定期浇树，随死随栽，各地并规定了偿罚办法，刺激了群众护林的积极性。
