Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, September 7th: The news undertakings in the Northeast Liberated Areas, after three years of vigorous efforts, have laid the foundation for further development. Currently, in addition to the Northeast Daily, which serves the entire region, there are more than ten major newspapers in the region, including the New Heilongjiang Daily, the Hejiang Daily, the Nenjiang New Daily, the Andong Daily, the Southern Liaoning Daily, the Victory Daily of Liaobei Province, the Masses Daily of the Hebei-Chahar-Jehol Border Region, and the Eastern Hebei Daily. In addition, there is the Inner Mongolia Daily, as well as more than ten private newspapers in Harbin, such as the Dazhong Daily, the Gongshang Daily, the Shenghuo Bao, the Wenhua Bao, and the Wu Bao. Each special district and larger county also publishes small newspapers. In addition to the Self-Defense Daily of the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region and the Logistics Daily of the Political Department of the Logistics Department, various field corps and rear military regions also publish newspapers in various forms. Major enterprise departments such as postal and telecommunications and railways also publish specialized small newspapers.

　　The Northeast Daily currently has a daily circulation of over 70,000 copies, covering all parts of the Northeast Liberated Areas. In mid-August, after the newspaper's printing plant installed a power rotary press, it can print 80,000 to 100,000 copies per hour, providing excellent conditions for expanding the circulation volume. The circulation of other provincial-level newspapers is also around 20,000 copies. Due to the convenient and developed railways and highways in Northeast China, and the developed modern paper industry, newspapers have sufficient paper, and distribution is extremely fast. Major cities can see the newspapers on the same day or the next day, and other remote towns and villages can see the newspapers within a week at the latest.

　　According to incomplete statistics, there are 500 reporters and editors in the news work force in various places. All newspapers have a large number of local, urban, and military special reporters and correspondents. The Northeast Daily currently has more than 150 regularly contributing special reporters, and the Andong Daily has more than 3,200 worker-peasant correspondents, which has played a significant role in the newspaper's work.

　　Among the magazines, "Knowledge," "Northeast Literature and Art," "Northeast Pictorial," and "Emancipated Happiness" have the widest sales. "Emancipated Happiness" is a popular publication loved by the vast number of farmers, with a circulation of 50,000 copies per issue. "Northeast Pictorial" is very popular among front-line soldiers, with a circulation of over 30,000 copies per issue.

　　The news agencies include the Northeast General Branch of the Xinhua News Agency and three branches in Hebei-Chahar-Jehol, Andong, and Southern Liaoning, a front-line branch, and nineteen sub-branches. The branches in Heilongjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, Liaobei, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia are currently being prepared for establishment and restoration.

　　There are currently eight Xinhua Broadcasting Stations in Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Jilin, Jiamusi, Andong, Hejiang, and Yanji. Among them, the Harbin Xinhua Broadcasting Station is the largest, and can be heard throughout the country and Southeast Asia (the station's call sign is XNMK, the wavelength is 42 meters shortwave, 7100 kilocycles, with programs from 11:25 to 13:30 in the afternoon, and 18:55 to 23:30 at night). In addition to relaying important news and other programs from the Xinhua News Agency headquarters, the Northeast stations also have joint broadcasts of news from the Northeast Liberated Areas throughout Northeast China.

　　In the past two years, newspapers and news agencies in the Northeast Liberated Areas have had some deviations in their reporting work, especially in the reporting of the land redistribution movement, where they made relatively serious "leftist" errors. But on the whole, they have made great achievements in publicizing the revolutionary war, publicizing the party's policies and guidelines, and reflecting the situation and exchanging experiences. Especially after the anti-"Ke Li Kong" movement last year, news workers in various places have been able to be more realistic and pay more attention to the study and mastery of the Party's various policies. Since this year, led by the Northeast Daily, they have more strictly promoted the spirit of criticism and self-criticism in the newspapers, making the newspapers a powerful tool for implementing policies and promoting work. The prestige of the newspapers has therefore increased day by day. The Northeast Daily currently receives over a thousand letters from readers every month, inquiring about policies, daily life issues, and criticisms and suggestions for the newspaper. The newspaper publishes and answers these letters with considerable space, showing that the newspaper has continuously strengthened its ties with the masses. The newspapers in Northeast China have published many articles on industrial technology, which has also been of significant help to industrial production in Northeast China. In order to meet the large demand for news cadres under the new situation, various places have begun to train news cadres. The News Cadre School established by the Andong Daily has now opened its second term; the News Training Class of the Southern Liaoning Daily has more than 50 students.

　　东北新闻事业发达
  　新闻工作者更能实事求是掌握政策报纸发扬批评与自我批评威信日高
    【新华社东北七日电】东北解放区新闻事业经三年来大力经营，已奠定进一步发展的基础。现全区大型报纸除全区性的东北日报外，计有新黑龙江报、合江报、嫩江新报、安东日报、辽南日报、辽北省的胜利报、冀察热辽的群众日报与冀东日报等各省、市报纸十余种。此外尚有内蒙古日报，及哈市私营报纸大众日报、工商日报、生活报、文化报、午报等十数种。各专区及各较大县份亦均有小型报纸出版，部队报纸除东北军区政治部之自卫报及后勤政治部之后勤报外，各野战兵团及后方军区均有各种形式的报纸出版。各大企业部如邮电、铁路等亦各出版专门性的小型报纸。
    东北日报现每日发行七万余份，遍及东北解放区各地。八月中旬该报印刷厂装置电力轮转机后，每小时可印报八万至十万份，使扩大发行数量具备了优越条件。其他各省级报纸发行亦均在二万份左右。由于东北铁路公路交通便利发达，及现代化造纸业发达，各报用纸充裕，发行极快，各大城市可当日或隔日见报，其他较远之城镇乡村最迟亦可于周内见报。
    各地新闻工作干部据不完全统计共有记者与编辑五百余人。各报皆拥有大量地方、城市、部队特约记者及通讯员。东北日报现有经常投稿之特约记者一百五十余人，安东日报有工农通讯员三千二百余人，对报纸工作起了很大作用。
    杂志方面，以“知识”、“东北文艺”、“东北画报”、“翻身乐”销路最广。“翻身乐”是广大农民所爱好的通俗刊物，每期发行达五万份。“东北画报”极受前线战士欢迎，每期发行三万余份。
    通讯社有新华社东北总分社及冀察热辽、安东、辽南三个分社，一个前线分社，十九个支社。近正筹备建立和恢复的有黑龙江、合江、嫩江、辽北、吉林及内蒙古地区各分社。
    广播电台现有哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江、吉林、佳木斯、安东、合江、延吉等八个新华广播电台，其中以哈尔滨新华广播电台为最大，全国及东南亚各地均能收听（按该台呼号为ＸＮＭＫ，波长短波为四二公尺，七一○○千周，时间自中午十一点二十五分到十三点三十分，及夜间的十八点五十五分到二十三点、三十点两个节目）。广播内容除转播新华总社之重要新闻等节目外，东北各台并有东北解放区新闻在全东北地区之联合播音。
    近两年来，东北解放区报纸及通讯社在报导工作上，曾发生若干偏向，特别是在平分土地运动的报导中犯过比较严重的左的错误，但从整个说来，他们在宣传革命战争、宣传党的政策路线及反映情况、交流经验等方面均有很大成绩。特别经过去年反“客里空”运动后，各地新闻工作者已更能实是求是，更加注意对党的各种政策的学习和掌握。本年以来。以东北日报为首，更严格发扬了报纸的批评与自我批评精神，使报纸进一步成为贯彻执行政策，推进工作的有力工具，报纸的威信因此日益提高。东北日报现每月收到读者来信达千余件，询问政策、日常生活问题、及对报纸批评与建议，报纸均以相当篇幅予以刊载和答复，显示报纸已不断地加强了与群众的联系。东北的报纸登载了很多关于工业技术的稿件，对于东北工业生产也有重要的帮助。各地为适应新形势下对于新闻干部的大量需要，已开始进行新闻干部的培养工作。安东日报设立之新闻干部学校，现已开办第二期；辽南日报之新闻训练班，现有学生五十余人。
