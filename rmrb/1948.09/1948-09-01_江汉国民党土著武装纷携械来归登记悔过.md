　　(Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 29th) Under the combined effect of our efforts to disintegrate and military strikes, Nationalist indigenous armed forces and government personnel in various parts of the Jianghan Military Region have brought their weapons to register and repent to the democratic government. Local democratic governments have repeatedly convened mass rallies to publicize the lenient policy, and have mobilized the families of the puppet regime and released prisoners of war to carry out extensive publicity and persuasion work. Our district and village cadres have also written individual letters to advise them to quickly reform. Incomplete statistics for Xiangyang, Zao yang, and Yicheng areas in June and July show that a total of 228 Nationalist indigenous armed forces and puppet government personnel registered with the government, handing over 139 long and short guns. These included Nationalist Security Captains Tao Dajun and Zhu Hanzhang, and puppet township chiefs Peng Gongmin, Huang Pengfei, and Huang Jiaji. In one district of Sui County, in June alone, 31 Nationalist indigenous armed forces platoon leaders, including Chang Haibin and Hu Dajun, brought 27 guns to surrender. Jiang Nianshan, the puppet Bao chief of Sujiahe Village in the county, and 20 others also voluntarily came to register with the democratic government in June. On June 20th, more than 30 members of the puppet township armed forces in Chenjiaxiang, Anying (newly established county, parts of Anlu and Yingshan), led by platoon leader Tang Wenpei, surrendered with 30 guns. Others from various places have been continuously contacting the democratic government to negotiate surrender. Those who came back were very grateful for our leniency, and expressed their determination to correct their past mistakes. Those who are willing to participate in work are appropriately employed by the democratic government, while the rest are released on bail to return home to live and work in peace. Those with difficult lives are given appropriate care.

    【新华社中原二十九日电】江汉军区各地国民党土著武装及政府人员，在我争取瓦解与军事打击配合下，纷纷携械归来，向民主政府登记悔过。各地民主政府曾一再召开群众大会宣传宽大政策，并发动伪属与释放的俘获人员作广泛宣传劝说工作，我区、村干部亦个别写信劝告促其从速自新。六、七两月襄（阳）、枣（阳）、宜（城）地区不完全统计：来归之国民党土著武装及伪政府人员向政府登记者即共达二百二十八人，交出长短枪一百三十九支。其中包括国民党保安队长陶大君、朱汉章，伪乡长彭工民、黄鹏飞、黄家吉等。随县一个区在六月份即有国民党土著武装分队长常海斌、胡大均等三十一人携枪二十七支来归。该县苏家河村伪保长姜年山等二十一人亦于六月自动前来向民主政府登记。六月廿日，安应（新设县，安陆、应山各一部）陈家巷伪乡武装三十余人在分队长唐文佩率领下携枪三十支投诚。其他各地向民主政府接洽投诚络绎不绝。来归人员对我之宽大均十分感激，表示决心痛改前非。除愿参加工作者民主政府酌予收留外，余均取保回家安居乐业。生活困难者并予适当照顾。
