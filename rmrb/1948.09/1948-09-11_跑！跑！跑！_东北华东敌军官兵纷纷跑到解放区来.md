Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Morale in the Kuomintang military in Northeast, North, and East China is disintegrating, and the number of deserters fleeing to the Liberated Areas is increasing daily, especially among the enemies besieged in Changchun, Shenyang, Xinmin, and Jin County. According to statistics, one enemy officer and soldier reception center established by the People's Liberation Army on the Northeast front alone received 1,738 officers and soldiers from various units of the enemy's New First Army, New Third Army, New Sixth Army, etc., who had deserted and fled to the Liberated Areas from June 18 to the end of July, including 822 non-commissioned officers. A large number of soldiers from the 87th and 88th Divisions entrenched in northern Shaanxi deserted, leaving only forty or fifty men in each regiment. Partial statistics from Wanping and Liangxiang in the West District of East China, Rongcheng, Dingxing, and Jin County in Central Hebei, and Yutai, Shanxian, and Feicheng in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area from January to June show that more than 12,000 enemy soldiers were received after surrendering. Among the 1,118 enemy officers and soldiers received in the West Hebei District from January to June, many were from the enemy's 16th Army, 92nd Army, etc., who voluntarily surrendered with their weapons. In the Jiaodong District of the East China Liberated Area, in July alone, 479 enemy personnel were received after surrendering, more than in any month in the first half of the year, and most of them had fled from the enemy's main force units, with the 54th Division accounting for 286 alone. After the Kaifeng and Eastern Henan campaigns, the 5th Army, one of the enemy's five main forces, has recently experienced platoon-level desertions. To prevent soldiers from deserting, the enemy in various places has employed various methods of special agent surveillance and brutal suppression, but they have been unable to stop it. For example, the remaining enemy troops in Jiaodong stipulate that soldiers and platoon leaders cannot go out without a company commander's note; a three-person guarantee system is implemented in the company; new recruits are not issued guns normally, only when they are drilling. However, one company of the New Third Brigade originally had ninety-seven men, but within a month, only twenty-eight remained. When the soldiers of that company ran away, three squad leaders took their guns to catch them, but they also took the opportunity to escape. Then the platoon leader took his gun to catch the squad leaders, but he also disappeared. The company commander and special agent chief saw that things were going badly and were afraid of being punished, so they finally defected to the Liberated Area.

  　东北华东敌军官兵纷纷跑到解放区来
    【新华社陕北五日电】东北、华北、华东各地国民党军事军心涣散，士气日趋低落，逃亡投奔解放区者日益增多，尤以困踞长春、沈阳、新民、锦县之敌为最甚。据统计，仅东北前线解放军某地所设立之敌军官兵收容所一处，从六月十八日起至七月底止，收容逃亡投奔解放区之敌新一军、新三军、新六军等各部官兵达一千七百卅八名，内尉部兵八百二十二名。困驻于陕北八十七师、八十八师士兵大批逃亡，每团仅剩四五十人。华东西区之宛平、良乡，冀中之容城、定兴、锦县，冀鲁豫之鱼台、单县、肥城等地自一月至六月的部分统计：共收容投诚敌军一万二千余名。其中平西区一月至六月收容之敌军官兵一千一百一十八名中，不少系从敌十六军、九十二军等部自动携械投诚者。华东解放区之胶东区，仅七月份一个月，收容投诚之敌军人员四百七十九名，较之上半年任何一个月为多，其中且绝大部分是从敌主力部队逃来的，仅整五十四师即占二百八十六名。开封、豫东战役后，号称敌五大主力之一的整五军，最近亦已发生整排逃亡现象。各地敌为防止士兵逃亡，施用了种种特务监视与残酷镇压办法，但亦无法制止。如残留胶东敌军规定，士兵和排长无连长条子不能外出；在连里实行三人联保；新兵平时不发枪，只在出操时才发枪。但新三旅的一个连原来有九十七人，一月内就跑剩了二十八人。该连士兵跑了，三个班长带枪去捉，结果也趁机逃跑了。于是排长又带枪去捉班长，但也一去不返。连长、特务长见事已糟，怕被惩办，最后就都投奔到了解放区来。
