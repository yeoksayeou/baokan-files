　　How to Use Iron Machines with Handspun Yarn
　　Answers to Readers' Questions from the Xingtai City Trade Union

To the Editor:

Regarding the development of the textile industry in our city from wooden machines to iron machines, here are the answers to the readers' questions, based on the information provided by Comrade Yan Jinyu, Chairman of the Third District Trade Union:

The first question: "Are these iron machines with iron wheels or electric iron machines? Does the wide cloth woven from handspun yarn use foreign warp and handspun weft, or handspun warp and handspun weft? If the warp is handspun yarn, has it been processed? How is it processed and modified?"

The iron machines in question are human-powered machines with iron wheels, not electric iron machines. The wide cloth made of handspun yarn is entirely made of handspun warp and weft. Before the [Sino-Japanese] Incident, there were iron wheel machines weaving wide floral cloth, but at that time, the yarn used was purely foreign yarn. During the enemy's [Japanese] occupation, cotton was monopolized, and all large and small textile industries were shut down. After liberation, the textile industry gradually recovered and developed with the support of the government, but at this time, we felt that the technology was low, and the quality of the products was poor, unattractive, and not durable. Therefore, it was often affected by foreign goods, and the masses did not welcome it. At this time, several experienced craftsmen began to study whether iron machines could weave handspun yarn. When they tried it, it kept breaking. Of course, the low quality of the yarn was a reason, but after investigation, it was found that the sizing was not good, and the yarn was not strong enough and easily became fuzzy, causing it to break. In the past, when using foreign yarn, only sizing the surface was enough, and after sizing, it only needed to be twisted once and dried. That would not work with handspun yarn. It must be processed and have materials added. Therefore, after research and experimentation, the solution is this: When sizing the yarn, in addition to using flour, some oil must also be added. The general experience is that one pound of oil is needed for twenty pounds of yarn (animal oil is better). First, mix the flour with water to make a thin paste, then melt the oil and mix it with the flour paste before applying it to the yarn. In summer, when the weather is humid and the yarn is soft, some glue must also be used (half a pound is enough for twenty pounds of yarn). Using the above-mentioned method of mixing animal oil, it will harden the yarn when used during sizing. In addition, after mixing the flour paste and oil together, apply the mixture to the yarn, knead it evenly, lift it out, twist it once on the sizing rod, and then twist it twice more when it is almost dry but not quite. At the same time, smooth it up and down several times with your hands, so that the flour paste is evenly distributed, and the yarn is shiny and strong. It must also be noted that handspun yarn is spun by women and does not have the uniform strength of foreign yarn. You have to twist it along the direction of the yarn, otherwise, if you twist it backwards, the yarn will become loose and weak, and it will easily break during weaving.

This experience solved the problem that had not been solved for a long time: the lack of strength of handspun yarn, the fuzziness and easy breakage when pulled on the machine. Therefore:

The second question, "Handspun yarn does not have enough tensile strength to be used as warp for wide cloth, and there are still problems with using iron wheel wooden machines, and electric iron machines have even greater force." With this method, iron wheel machines can be used completely. However, electric motors have not been used yet and still need to be studied. Here, we cannot ignore the improvement in the quality of yarn due to the progress of women's spinning, which is also a decisive factor.

This experience is now widely adopted throughout the city. Wooden machines will all be replaced with iron machines. They are indeed more convenient and faster to use, and the quality of the cloth has been greatly improved, which is welcomed by the masses. This local product - floral striped wide cloth - has been sold to Ci County, Wu'an, and the Changzhi and Lu'an areas of Shanxi, and merchants are flocking to buy it. All factories are unable to meet the demand. The above can only be considered a bit of experience gained, and cannot be considered a major achievement. In the future, we are willing to work with workers and industrialists in the textile industry to conduct joint research.

### 土线怎样上铁机　邢市职工会答读者问

　　土线怎样上铁机
  　邢市职工会答读者问编辑同志：
    关于本市纺织业由木机改用铁机这种发展上，读者询问的几个问题，根据三区工会主席阎金玉同志所谈分别答复如下：
    第一个问题：“铁轮木还是电动铁机？土宽布用的是洋经土纬呢，还是土经土纬？如果经线是土线是否加过工？怎样加工改造的？”
    所说铁机是铁轮的人力机，而非电动铁机。土宽布完全是土线经纬。原来事变前就有铁轮机织宽面花布，不过那时所用线子纯系洋线。在敌人统治时期，棉花被垄断，大小纺织业全被封门。解放后纺织业经政府扶植逐渐恢复发展，不过这时就感到技术低，出来的货身分坏，不好看不耐穿。因此常常受外货影响，群众也不欢迎。这时几个有经验的工师才着手研究铁机能否织土线？试用起来总好断，当然线子质量低是个原因，但考查结果，浆不好线子，线子劲小容易发毛也好断。过去使用洋纱，只面做浆而且浆出来拧一次晒干就行了，土线那样就不行。必须加工加材料，故经研究试验结果是这样：在浆线子时除去用面以外还须放一些油，一般经验是二十斤线需用油一斤（腥油较好）先将面用水和成稀糊糊，然后将油熔化开与面糊掺和起来就能下线。如果在夏天气候湿线劲软还须用些水胶（二十斤线有半斤就够）。如以上腥油掺和办法，浆线时一块用上起干硬作用，此外浆时把面糊连油一并闹好以后再将线子下浆揉匀，提出来拧一遍上浆杆，等快干而未干时再拧两次，同时用手上下多理顺几次，这样面糊走匀，线子又光又有劲。还须注意土线是妇女纺不比洋纱是一股劲，得顺线劲拧，否则拧倒了线，发松皮劲，织时容易断。
    这方面得出经验就解决了好长时间所没有解决的土线没劲，上机一拉发毛容易断的问题，因此：
    第二个问题，“土纱用作宽布经线拉力不够，使用铁轮木机尚有问题，电动铁机力更大”。这样话铁轮机完全可以使用的，唯电动机未曾用过尚须研究。这里不能忽视妇女纺织进步线子质量提高，也是一决定原因。
    这种经验现全市普遍采用，木机将全部换为铁机，在使用上确灵便而快，布的质量已大大提高，得到广大群众欢迎，此路货——花条宽面布已推销到磁县、武安及山西长治、潞安一带，各商贩纷纷前来争购，各厂皆是供不应求。以上这只能算是一点经验之获得，不能算是什么大的成就，今后愿与纺织业行的工人，工业家共同研究。  　　　　邢台市职工会九月六日
