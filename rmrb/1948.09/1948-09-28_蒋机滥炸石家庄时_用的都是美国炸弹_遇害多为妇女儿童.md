Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 27th—When the Kuomintang Air Force indiscriminately bombed the peaceful city of Shijiazhuang in mid-September, the bombs and incendiary bombs dropped were all marked with "U.S.A." (Made in the United States). Most of the civilian victims were women and children. In the "Christian Gospel Church" at 289 Xinhua Road in the city, five female church members, Wang Weizhen, Li Wenhua, Hu Aimei, Zhang Xiulin, and Yang Zangen, were bombed to death, and Zhu Junlan, Wang Xianglan, and Li Guixiang were injured. Seven bombs fell on the residences of Dr. Ayers (American), representative of the North China Working Team of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, who had just arrived in Shijiazhuang from Tianjin and Henan, and Mr. Hiss (American), President of the Friends Service Unit, but fortunately there were no casualties. More than 200,000 citizens in Shijiazhuang and farmers in the suburbs are extremely resentful of the Kuomintang bandits' atrocities of killing peaceful residents with the help of American imperialism. In Xiaojiaying, 15 miles away from the city, an old man surnamed Ren, in front of the body of his only grandson who was less than a month old, said with grief and indignation: "If I capture Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi alive, I will make them pay me back my grandson!" Under the slogan of avenging the dead, the citizens are actively carrying out various production and support work.
