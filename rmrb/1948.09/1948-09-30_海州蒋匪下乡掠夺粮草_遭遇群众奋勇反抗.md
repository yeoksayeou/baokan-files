Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Consolidated news from Kuomintang-controlled newspapers: On August 27th, more than 40 members of the puppet Donghai County Security Team, belonging to the Nationalist army stationed in Xinba, more than 30 li south of Haizhou on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, went to a village west of Xinba to plunder grain. A farmer surnamed Hu pleaded with the team leader but was beaten black and blue. Immediately, more than 150 villagers, men and women, came running with homemade cannons, axe heads, and iron forks, surrounding the bandit troops, saying, "We will fight you to the death! If you don't die, we won't be able to live." Two bandit soldiers were injured on the spot, and the team was ordered to surrender their weapons. Furthermore, on August 28th, a squad from the 449th Regiment of the Nationalist 44th Division stationed on Jinpingshan, south of Haizhou city, went to a village east of Xinba to grab grain and chickens. When a villager surnamed Zhao reasoned with them, he was slapped twice and knocked to the ground. Struggling to get up, he was stabbed with a bayonet by a bandit, and blood flowed freely. The masses were filled with irrepressible anger. Immediately, more than 80 villagers, men and women, armed with wooden poles and sickles, surged forward and seized two rifles.

　　海州蒋匪下乡掠夺粮草
  　遭遇群众奋勇反抗
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】综合国民党区报纸消息：陇海路东段海州南三十余里新霸之伪东海县保安中队四十余人，八月二十七日到新霸以西某庄掠夺粮草，农民胡某向该队队长哀求，却被打得满身青肿。庄上群众顿时跑来男女一百五十多人，拿着土炮、斧镞、铁叉，将该匪军团团包围，说：“与你们拚了！你们不死，我们也活不成。”当场打伤两个匪军，并喝令该队缴械。又八月二十八日驻海州城南锦屏山的国民党军整四四师四四九团一个班，到新霸以东某庄抢粮抓鸡。庄上赵某向其说理，被两个耳光打倒在地，挣扎起来又被匪用刺刀猛戮，鲜血直流。群众怒不可遏，当即有男女八十余人，齐执木杠、镰刀拥上，夺得步枪两支。
