(From the Ping-Bao Front) A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in North China held a large-scale sand table review after the Ping-Bao Campaign. On the large threshing ground in the village, a model of the south city wall of Xushui was built, more than three zhang long. All the large bunkers, pillboxes, obstacles, ditches, bridges, and various gun emplacements were made according to the original. Each participating unit reported its pre-war preparations, the situation encountered during combat, and how it was handled. They also used the sand table to compare and explain, and finally everyone commented and found the meritorious units. Yan Shiping, the second platoon leader of the first company of a certain unit, reported the meticulous organization and preparation of the second platoon before the general attack: compiling numbers, repeated drills, using sorghum stalks to make chevaux-de-frise, and using small sticks to tie explosives for testing. Before departure, when checking confidence, it was discovered that comrades responsible for the sneak attack and blasting raised concerns: the moon made it easy to be spotted by the enemy, the accumulated water made noise when walking, etc. The cadres explained these concerns one by one to dispel them. At the start of the battle, he described how he blasted away three layers of obstacles such as wooden fences and chevaux-de-frise, and how he blasted a section of the city wall during the general attack, opening a path for the troops to charge. The city-climbing action was reported by Feng Yunhui, the third platoon leader of the company, on the three sets of experiences in organizing the attack and the ladder-climbing methods studied before the war. He said: At the beginning of the attack, after the tenth squad was injured by enemy flanking fire, the second and eleventh squads quickly took over. Before the ladder was set up, Deputy Company Commander Zhang Fuzhen and soldier Guo Baotai tried to climb up the city wall first. At this time, Guo Baotai himself reported how he climbed the city, how he went to the enemy's large bunker, and how he repelled two enemy counter-attacks by himself, protecting the troops to continue climbing the city. After the report, everyone commented, supplemented, and put forward different opinions. Finally, it was unanimously decided that the second platoon of the first company had made great contributions and should be awarded a great merit, and Zhang Fuzhen and Guo Baotai, who were the first to climb the city, should also be awarded great merits. Then, the responsibility for failing to complete the task was investigated. Everyone believed that after the third company climbed the city, it did not quickly go down the city and develop in depth. Deputy Company Commander Shi Jianxin said, "The city wall is more than one zhang high, and I was afraid of falling and breaking it, so I started digging the city wall." Squad Leader Wang Yiheng said, "The deputy company commander said he loved the soldiers and was afraid of them falling and breaking, which is not right. This is not loving the soldiers, this is failing to complete the task!" Some said, "The wall is very thick, and it took more than an hour to dig through it, but in the end they still jumped down, and no one was injured. It was just that he was afraid of death! He was not actively developing, and should be held responsible!" A platoon leader said, "After Company Commander Ma Qingshan was wounded, he should have replaced the company commander in commanding the troops, and should not have only commanded the firepower team. The battalion commander ordered him to go up, but he did not go, and he should also be held responsible!" It was proposed that these comrades should be subject to disciplinary action. Such a sand table review concretely carried out the democratic comparison and evaluation movement of the troops, so that the commanders and fighters who were brave and resourceful in the battle were rewarded, and the commanders and fighters who did not complete the task accepted the lesson.

　　某部开展民主比评运动
  　筑成模型检讨战斗
    【平保前线讯】华北人民解放军某部于平保战役后，举行大沙盘检讨。在驻村的沙堆大场上，筑成徐水南城墙模型，全长三丈多，凡当地所有大碉、地堡、障碍、沟壕、桥、各种枪眼都按原样制好。由各参战部队报告自己的战前准备，战斗中遇到的情况，和怎样处理的。并在沙盘上来回比方、说明，最后大家评论，找出有功部队。某部一连二排长阎式平，报告二排总攻前的严密组织和准备：编成号码，反复演习，用秫秸做拒马，用小棍绑炸药试验，在出发前，检查信心时，发现担任偷袭爆破的同志提出：有月亮容易被敌人发觉，有积水走路就响等等顾虑，干部就一一解释，解除这些顾虑。战斗开始时，又怎样爆破扫清木栅、拒马等三层障碍，总攻时怎样炸坏一块城墙，给部队打开了一道冲锋道路。登城动作由该连三排长冯运会报告攻城组织的三套经验及战前研究的架梯登城办法。他说：攻城开始时，十班上去受敌侧射火力杀伤后，二、十一等班就迅速接上去，梯子还没有架好，副连长张福振和战士郭保泰就想法从城墙上爬上去首先登城。这时就由郭保泰自己报告怎样登的城，怎样走到敌人大碉边，一个人打退了敌人两次反冲锋，保护部队继续登城。报告完了以后，大家评论补充和提出不同的意见，最后一致选出一连二排功劳大该立大功，先登城的张福振、郭保泰也立大功。接着就追究没有完成任务的责任。大家认为：三连登城以后，没有很快下城向纵深发展，副连长石建新说：“一丈多高的城墙，恐怕跳下去摔坏了，就挖起城墙来。”班长王义恒说：“副连长是说爱兵怕摔坏，这不对。这不是爱兵，是没有完成任务！”有的说：“墙很厚，挖一点多钟也挖不透，最后还是跳下去，也没有摔坏人，就是他怕死！不积极发展，应负责任！”一个排长说：“指导员马庆山同志在连长负伤以后，应代替连长指挥部队，不应光指挥火力队，营长命他上去，他也不去，同样要负责任！”提出这些同志应受纪律处分。这样的沙盘检讨具体的开展了部队的民主比评运动，使在战斗中有勇敢有智谋的指战员受到了奖励，使没有完成任务的指战员接受了教训。
