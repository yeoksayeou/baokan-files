    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社报导：希腊民主军正胜利地击退保垒法西斯军队在马其顿、艾匹鲁斯地区的进攻，并在色萨利主动出击。保垒法西斯军队十余日来对马其顿区，主军阵地的进犯，均被击退，并蒙受重大损失。据民主军俘掳的敌军士兵供称“保垒法西斯军队在这一地区死伤的军官达百分之七十五。”雅典公报亦承认民主军曾在此区进行“猛烈的反攻”。在马其顿萨伊罗皮加作战的敌军第四十五旅，曾发生哗变，拒绝对民主军作战。在艾匹鲁斯之莫尔干山区，民主军打败了法西斯军队的两次攻势。在色萨利，民主军制敌机先，于九月五日进攻拉利萨至柯萨尼铁路线上的重镇第那伏斯城。参加进攻该城的民主军有三个旅及驻兵部队。民主军在歼灭该城守军后占领了该城。次日晨，民主军主动撤出该城。该城居民七十人自动参加了民主军。
