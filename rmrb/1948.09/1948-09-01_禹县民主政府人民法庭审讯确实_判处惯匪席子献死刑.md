Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 29th. Xi Zixian, a habitual bandit in western Henan and deputy commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang's Yu (County), Chang (Ge), Yan (Ling), Fu (Gou), and Wei (Chuan) five counties, as well as Kuomintang County Magistrate of Yu County, had been committing crimes in the Yu County area for over ten years. The People's Liberation Army arrested him near Zhengzhou on June 19th. People from various counties formed groups to file accusations with the democratic government. After a thorough trial by the People's Court of the Yu County Democratic Government, he was found guilty and sentenced to death according to the law. On July 27th, a mass meeting was held in Yu County to announce his crimes and carry out the execution by firing squad, which greatly pleased the people. At the meeting, the democratic government also reiterated its lenient policy, calling on scattered bandits to recognize the overall situation and repent and reform as soon as possible. Bandit Xi began looting and plundering in the Yu County area in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Later, he was incorporated into the Kuomintang army and became an official bandit, intensifying his crimes, slaughtering the people, and acting tyrannically, committing all kinds of evil. Later, he surrendered to the Japanese invaders and actively massacred anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians. After the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang again appointed him as a brigade commander, and then transferred him to his current position. After the liberation of western Henan, our army and the democratic government have consistently adopted a lenient policy of striving for defection towards bandits and scattered Kuomintang bandit troops who were wandering around. However, Bandit Xi remained unrepentant. In May of this year, when Bandit Xi harassed Yu County, he buried 37 merchants and civilians alive within five days. In total, Bandit Xi has successively killed more than 3,000 people in Yu County, Mi County, Dengfeng County, and other counties.

　　禹县民主政府人民法庭审讯确实
  　判处惯匪席子献死刑
    【新华社中原二十九日电】豫西惯匪、国民党禹（县）、长（葛）、鄢（陵）、扶（沟）、洧（川）五县副总指挥兼禹县县长席子献在禹县一带为非作歹业经十余年。解放军于六月十九日在郑州附近将其逮获，各县人民成群结队向民主政府控告，经禹县民主政府人民法庭审讯确实，依法判处死刑，于七月二十七日在禹县召开群众大会，宣布罪状，执行枪决，人心大快。会上，民主政府并重申宽大政策，号召散匪认清大局，早日悔过自新。席匪抗战初期即在禹县一带打家劫舍，后经国民党收编成官土匪，乃变本加厉，屠杀人民，横行霸道，无恶不作。后即投降日寇，积极屠杀抗日军民。日寇投降后，国民党又加委作旅长，转任现职。豫西解放，我军与民主政府对土匪与零散流窜的土著国民党匪军始终采取争取反正的宽大政策。但席匪怙恶不悛，今年五月席匪窜扰禹县城时，五天内即活埋商民三十七人。总计席匪先后杀害禹县、密县、登封等县人民在三千人以上。
