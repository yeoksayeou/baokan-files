Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 15th: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region's *Mass Daily* recently published an editorial calling for the widespread planting of winter wheat. The editorial stated: "Seize the time, get organized, expand the planting of winter wheat, and increase grain production. This is a major political task for the border region's farmers to improve agricultural production at present."

The editorial pointed out: "Due to the devastation caused by the Kuomintang bandit troops, the labor, livestock, farm implements, and rations of the masses have suffered severe losses, resulting in generally rough cultivation. In areas that were liberated later, as well as border areas, spring plowing was missed, or the cultivated area was greatly reduced due to frequent harassment by Kuomintang troops. The serious drought this spring, and the continued drought in some areas this year; the repeated warfare in the Huanglong New District, and the lack of organizational leadership experience among some cadres in the New District; therefore, the recovery of grain this year will not be very large, and grain shortages may still occur next year. In order to smoothly expand production next year, we must mobilize and organize all the people to vigorously expand the planting of winter wheat."

The editorial called for expanding the existing six million mu of wheat fields by another 600,000 mu. Each sub-region must ensure that all existing wheat fields are planted, and strive to plant as much winter wheat as possible in areas where it was previously planted less or not at all. To this end, it is necessary to implement correct land policies, consolidate the farmers' enthusiasm for production, appropriately organize the labor force, and strive to improve wheat planting techniques.

The editorial pointed out that the central key to completing this major task lies in the correct, timely, and meticulous organization and leadership of local party and government personnel.

　　陕甘宁群众日报号召：
    广种冬麦增产粮食
    【新华社西北十五日电】陕甘宁边区群众日报顷发表社论，号召广种冬麦。社论称：抓紧时间，组织起来，广种冬麦，增产粮食，这是目前边区农民提高农业生产的一个重大政治任务。社论指出：由于国民党匪军的摧残，群众的劳力、畜力、农具、口粮受到严重损失，使耕作一般都较粗糙；光复较晚地区，以及边沿地区，春耕失去时机，或由于国民党军经常骚扰，耕地面积大量减少；今春的严重灾荒与今年部分地区继续遭受灾荒；黄龙新区战争反复，新区部分干部缺乏组织领导生产经验；因此今年粮食的收复量不会很大，明年的粮食还可能发生困难。为使明年能顺利扩大生产，必须动员与组织全体人民，大力广种冬麦。社论号召在现有的六百万亩麦田的基础上，再扩大六十万亩。各分区要保证原有的麦田全都种上，并争取过去少种、没有种过的地区尽量多种冬麦。为此必须执行正确的土地政策，巩固农民生产积极性，适当地组织劳动力，并在种麦的技术上力求改进。社论指出，完成这一重大任务的中心关键，在于各地党政人员正确、及时、细密的组织与领导。
