　　Qingyuan Border Area Village Militia
  　Combining Labor and Military Affairs to Protect the Autumn Harvest
    [Jizhong Dispatch] The militia of a certain village in the Qingyuan border area is implementing a combination of labor and military affairs to protect the autumn harvest of all the villagers. The village is 25 li from Baoding and 15 li from the Beigoutou stronghold. After the autumn harvest began, the enemy actively prepared to seize the crops. Village cadres and militiamen held a meeting to discuss organizing mutual aid teams. They divided the entire village's militia into five squads, which took turns on duty every day. The rest carried their rifles to work collectively. Whoever's crops were ripe, they would help harvest first. If there was a situation, they would pick up their rifles and go to fight. This way, they did not delay production and could protect the masses in harvesting crops. Starting from September 3rd, the militiamen worked very enthusiastically. They worked a full day during the day, ambushed enemy agents at night, and guarded against the enemy in the morning. If there was no situation after meals, they would go to the fields. In this way, in just a few days, fifteen families harvested their ripe crops. From September 3rd to 13th, an average of twelve people worked every day for eleven days, harvesting more than 150 mu of crops just for the militiamen's families, and contracted to harvest another 49 mu for others. In between, they also cooperated with other villages to fight two battles, and chased away enemy agents three times at night. Under the active leadership of the militia, the entire village's enthusiasm for production is very high. Now they are planning to jointly pull water carts to irrigate the land and prepare to plant wheat.

　　清苑边沿某村民兵
  　劳武结合掩护秋收
    【冀中电】清苑边缘区某村民兵实行劳武结合，掩护全村群众秋收。该村离保定二十五里，离北沟头据点十五里。秋收开始后，敌人积极准备抢秋。村干和民兵便开会商量组织互助组，把全村民兵分了五班，每天轮班出去放哨，其余的集体背着枪去作活，谁家的庄稼熟了，就先帮助谁家收拾，有了情况，背起枪来就去打仗。这样又不耽误生产，又能掩护群众收拾庄稼，从九月三日开始，民兵们干的很起劲，白天做一天活，晚上还伏击敌之特务，早晨警戒敌人，吃了饭没情况就下地。这样，不到几天，十五家的熟庄稼收拾到家了。从九月三日到十三日，十一天中每天平均十二个人做活，光给民兵家里就收割了一百五十多亩庄稼，又给别人包工收了四十九亩。中间还配合外村打了两次仗，夜间追跑了三回特务。在民兵积极带动下，全村生产情绪都很高。现在他们正盘算着合伙拉水车浇地，准备种麦。
