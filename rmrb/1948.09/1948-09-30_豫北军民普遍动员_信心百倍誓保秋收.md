　　【Taihang Telegram】Since late August, the Yubei border area has been actively mobilizing to protect the autumn harvest. The mobilization has now been completed at all levels, laying a solid foundation for carrying out a truly mass-based struggle to protect the autumn harvest. The Fourth and Fifth Military Sub-districts and the thirteen border counties under their jurisdiction have successively convened meetings of key cadres above the district level from various systems. Each military sub-district also held mass mobilization meetings for autumn harvest protection at the county or district level. Village cadres, militia, self-defense forces, district cadres, working teams, and county garrison soldiers have generally undergone ideological mobilization and organizational rectification. The following tasks were generally carried out during the mobilization for autumn harvest protection: First, the left or right leaning ideological tendencies among cadres and the masses were eliminated. In areas where the struggle against the enemy was relatively proactive and military victories were constantly being won, the common tendency of underestimating the enemy and neglecting actual preparations for autumn harvest protection was overcome. In areas where our strength was relatively weak, pessimistic and fatigued sentiments were overcome, and confidence in the victory of autumn harvest protection was enhanced. On the one hand, all localities guided everyone to analyze and study the victorious situation nationwide and the favorable conditions for struggle locally. On the other hand, they educated the masses to recognize the severity of the disaster in the Chiang area and the desperate struggle of the Chiang bandits, who would inevitably engage in crazy grain grabbing. The Second District of Xiuwu also educated and overcame the passive and retreating idea of simply relying on the main force, by promoting the active fighting spirit among cadres. Second, the experiences and lessons learned from all aspects of the wheat protection struggle were specifically summarized, and the policy thinking of cadres and the masses was further clarified. They mastered the weapons for carrying out the autumn harvest protection struggle, and confidence in victory was further enhanced. On this basis, all localities, from top to bottom, clearly proposed to defeat the enemy by correctly implementing policies. The guerrilla warfare was pushed into the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the focus of the struggle was moved forward, and the strength of village-level and joint defense self-defense was strengthened. In particular, the mobilization and organization of self-defense forces to cooperate with the militia to strengthen armed struggle, and to more widely carry out mass guerrilla warfare. Third, commendations and model selections were carried out to promote new heroism in the autumn harvest protection, and to strengthen organization and discipline. A certain unit of the Fifth Military Sub-district's local armed forces and the militia armed forces of Zhangnan Anyang in Ye County successively held grand commendation and celebration model meetings, and 716 heroes and model individuals who emerged since the wheat protection struggle were gloriously awarded. Six villages, including Dashuang in Ji County, a joint defense, and four militia joint defenses, including Wang Ergang in Anyang, were also awarded the title of "Model." This established the backbone of the struggle and further aroused the fighting spirit of the masses. A certain unit of the local armed forces proposed to further develop the movement to create model squads and platoons during the autumn harvest protection. At the conferences of more than 8,000 militia and self-defense forces, county garrison soldiers, district cadres, and working teams held in Anyang and Ji County respectively, collective autumn harvest protection oaths were taken to fully defend the autumn harvest.

　　豫北军民普遍动员
  　信心百倍誓保秋收
    【太行电】豫北边地自八月下旬以来，积极动员保秋，现已逐级完成，给开展真正群众性的保秋斗争奠定有力基础。四、五分区及其所辖之十三个边沿县，均先后召开了各系统区以上主要干部会。各分区亦以县或区为单位举行了带有群众性的保秋动员会，村干，民兵，自卫队，区干队，武工队，县营兵，普遍经过思想动员与组织整顿。在动员保秋中普遍作了以下几件事情：第一、肃清了干部与群众中或左或右的思想倾向。在对敌斗争比较主动、军事上不断获胜的地区，克服了普遍存在着的轻敌麻痹思想与忽视实际保秋准备的倾向；在我力量较为薄弱的地区，克服了悲观与疲倦情绪，提高了保秋胜利信心。各地一方面引导大家分析研究全国胜利形势与当地斗争的有利条件，一方面教育群众认识蒋区灾情严重，蒋匪垂死挣扎，必然疯狂枪秋。修武二区并以发扬干部中积极的斗争情绪，教育和克服单纯依靠主力的消极退缩思想。第二、具体总结保麦斗争中各方面的经验教训，进一步明确了干部与群众的政策思想，掌握了进行保秋斗争的武器，胜利信心更加提高。在这个基础上，各地自上而下明确提出要以正确执行政策来战胜敌人。将游击战争推向国民党区，把斗争重点向前推进，并加强村级与联防自卫的力量。特别是发动和组织自卫队协同民兵加强武装斗争，更广泛的开展群众性游击战争。第三、进行评功表模，开展保秋中新英雄主义运动，加强组织性纪律性。五分区地方兵团某部及邺县漳南安阳民兵武装，先后举行了盛大评功贺功表模大会，保麦斗争以来涌现出的七百一十六名英雄模范光荣受奖。汲县大双等六个村，一个联防，与安阳王二岗等四个民兵联防，亦荣获“模范”的称号。由此树立了斗争骨干，更加鼓起群众斗争情绪。地方兵团某部队提出在保秋中进一步开展创造模范班、排运动。安阳汲县分别召开的八千余民兵自卫队，县营兵，区干队，武工队等大会上，均集体举行保秋宣誓，全力保卫秋收。
