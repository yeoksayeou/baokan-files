(Jilu Yu Electric) Currently, Juancheng County is facing a severe famine and insect plague. The County Committee has specifically decided that disaster relief and preparations for planting wheat are the central tasks. Due to enemy destruction and "leftist" errors in our policy implementation, Juancheng has experienced a reduction in manpower and livestock, resulting in more than 300 hectares of abandoned land. Although cadres throughout the county led the masses in rushing to plant autumn seedlings, 11,181 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, but many planted areas cannot be hoeed due to continuous autumn rains. Weeds are rampant, and seedlings are only five or six inches high, so the amount of wasteland has actually increased compared to before. Not only that, but severe insect infestations have been discovered in the second, third, fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth districts, causing insect plagues. The masses in Juancheng are therefore experiencing great difficulties in their lives, and some are preparing to flee the famine. In this serious situation, the County Committee convened a meeting of activists from across the county on August 25 to discuss emergency rescue measures. The County Committee first pointed out that the disaster situation is developing, and it is necessary to resolutely overcome the erroneous thinking of some cadres who do not care about the suffering of the masses, and called on every comrade to actively lead the masses to eliminate disasters, overcome difficulties, and strive to plant all wheat this year. The following decisions were made at the meeting: (1) Cadres must personally organize, mobilize, and lead the masses to quickly weed and strive for a good harvest of late seedlings. If the seedlings are truly unusable, they can be removed immediately to cultivate the land and prepare for planting wheat. (2) Mobilize the masses to work together to catch and kill black insects. The methods are: 1. Manually catch them row by row; 2. Sprinkle soot from the bottom of pots on autumn seedlings in the morning to prevent insects from eating the seedlings; 3. Dig ditches to let the insects crawl into the ditches and quickly bury them. (3) Call on the masses to buy livestock together. First, dispel the masses' hesitation and unwillingness to buy, explaining that in the event of war, they can sell the livestock after planting wheat. (4) Investigate and collect statistics on how many households cannot solve the problem of wheat planting, and how much seed is needed, so that the government can help solve it as soon as possible. In addition to the above active production and disaster relief measures, the masses throughout the county are called upon to accumulate substitute foods, and cadres and staff of various agencies are to implement savings in preparation for the famine.

　　灾荒严重威胁鄄城
  　县委领导灭荒种麦节约渡荒
    【冀鲁豫电】目前鄄城县正处在严重荒灾和虫灾威胁中。县委会特决定灭荒准备种麦为当前工作中心任务。鄄城因受敌人摧残及我在执行政策上左倾错误，以致人畜力减少，造成荒地三百余顷，虽经全县干部领导群众抢种秋苗，已灭荒一万一千一百八十一亩，但有许多已下种地区又因秋雨连绵不能锄地，野草丛生，苗高只五六寸，荒地反而较前增多。不仅如此，二、三、四、五、七、九六个区发现虫害相当严重，造成虫灾。鄄城群众因此甚感生活困难、有的准备逃荒。在此严重情况下，县委会特于八月二十五日召开全县活动分子大会，讨论紧急抢救措施。县委会首先指出目前灾情正在发展，要坚决克服部分干部中不关心群众疾苦的错误思想，并号召从现在起，每个同志应积极领导群众消灭灾荒，克服困难，争取今年全部种上麦子。会上作出如下决定：（一）干部要亲自组织动员领导群众，赶快锄草，争取晚苗收成。如苗子真不成用，可除去立即耕地，准备种麦。（二）发动群众一齐下手捕灭黑虫，其办法：一、用手挨垄挨晾捕捉；二、早晨用锅底灰向秋苗上撒，制止虫吃秋苗；三、挖渠让虫爬到渠里赶快埋掉。（三）号召群众合伙买牲口。首先解除群众犹豫不愿买的思想顾虑，说明战争情况下，种完麦后可以卖。（四）调查统计无法解决种麦的户有多少，需要多少种子，政府可及早帮助解决。除以上积极生产救灾办法外，并号召全县群众积存代食品及各机关干部职员实行节约备荒。
