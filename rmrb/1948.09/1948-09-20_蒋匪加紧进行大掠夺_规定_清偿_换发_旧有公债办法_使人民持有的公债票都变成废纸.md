Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. The Kuomintang reactionary government is further plundering the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas through two measures: "clearing" old puppet legal tender public bonds and exchanging old foreign currency public bonds for newly issued so-called "consolidated public bonds." The "Measures for Handling Legal Tender Public Bonds," passed and promulgated by the Kuomintang Executive Yuan on the 4th of this month, stipulate that the "cleared" legal tender public bonds include seventeen types of bonds issued from 1928 to 1944. These were all issued by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to make up for its fiscal deficits and increase the wealth of the four major families. A large portion of these public bonds has not yet been repaid. According to a dispatch from the Associated Press in Nanjing on the 6th, citing Kuomintang official disclosures, this figure is 6 billion yuan. The Kuomintang government's current "clearing" method is to try its best to suppress the repayment multiple, making it far behind the current multiple of price increases, so that the people's assets are greatly devalued, almost equivalent to confiscation. For example, the "clearing" multiple for five types of public bonds, such as the 1936 Unified Public Bond, is stipulated as 27,000 times, but since 1936, prices in the Kuomintang area have risen at least 7 million times (according to the Central News Agency's figure on the 8th of this month). In reality, this devalues the capital used by the people to purchase these public bonds to less than one two hundred and sixtieth. In 1936, ordinary people took ten yuan to buy public bonds, and at that time, these ten yuan could buy one dan of rice. Now, according to the Kuomintang's "clearing" multiple, they can exchange for 270,000 "legal tender" (that is, 9 cents of counterfeit gold yuan), but they can only buy four or five silver yuan-sized small baked cakes. Under this "clearing" method, the public bonds held by the people become waste paper.

As for the step of issuing new so-called "consolidated public bonds" to exchange for foreign currency public bonds, it is part of a whole set of conspiracies by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to deprive the people of their gold, silver, and foreign currency assets. According to the "Principles for the Issuance of Consolidated Public Bonds" passed and promulgated by the Kuomintang Executive Yuan on the 4th, the amount of this "consolidated public bond" to be issued is 523 million counterfeit gold yuan. The exchange targets are four types of British and American gold bonds issued from 1938 to 1944. These bonds were originally purchased by the people under the order of the Kuomintang government with gold, silver, and foreign currency, or converted from legal tender into foreign currency. The Kuomintang government had promised to repay them with cash and foreign exchange. Now, under the name of "exchange," the Kuomintang government completely cancels the people's right to recover these gold, silver, and foreign currency, or to obtain repayment according to more stable foreign currency prices, and exchanges them for so-called "consolidated public bonds" denominated in rapidly depreciating counterfeit gold yuan paper currency. Moreover, according to the original issuance regulations, these foreign currency public bonds will soon mature and should be fully repaid. But the Kuomintang government now wants to exchange them for so-called "consolidated public bonds," and the repayment date of these "consolidated public bonds" is postponed to five, ten, or even twenty years later. In this way, with the passage of time and the depreciation of the counterfeit gold yuan, the result of this "consolidation," like the above-mentioned "clearing," is that the "consolidated public bonds" in the hands of the people are invisibly transferred into the treasury of the four major families. This is another great plundering magic trick played by Chiang Kai-shek.

　　蒋匪加紧进行大掠夺
  　规定“清偿”“换发”旧有公债办法     
    使人民持有的公债票都变成废纸
    【新华社陕北十五日电】国民党反动政府又以“清偿”旧有伪法币公债，和新发行的所谓“整理公债”换发旧有外币公债两项办法，掠夺国民党统治区人民。国民党行政院本月四日通过并公布之“法币公债处理办法”中，规定“清偿”之法币公债包括自一九二八年至一九四四年发行的十七种债券，都是过去蒋家匪帮为弥补其财政赤字和增加四大家族财富而发行者。而这些公债中的极大一部分现在尚未归还，据美联社南京六日电引国民党官方披露此项数字为六十亿元。国民党政府现在“清偿”的办法是极力压低偿还的倍数，使之远远落后于现在物价上涨的倍数，使人民这笔资产大量贬值，几乎等于没收。例如一九三六年的统一公债等五种公债“清偿”倍数规定为二万七千倍，但从一九三六年以来，国民党区物价至少已经上涨了七百万倍（据本月八日中央社数字），实际上这就是将人民用以购买这笔公债的资本贬值到二百六十分之一以下。一九三六年老百姓拿十块钱去购买公债，当时这十块钱能买一担米，现在按照国民党“清偿”倍数换到二十七万“法币”（即九分伪金圆券），却只能买到四五个银圆大的小烧饼了。人民所持有的公债票在这种“清偿”办法下就成了废纸。
    至于发行新的所谓“整理公债”用以换发外币公债的步骤，则是蒋家匪帮剥夺人民金、银、外币资产的一整套阴谋中的一部分。此项“整理公债”之发行数额，据国民党行政院四日通过公布之“整理公债发行原则”规定，为五亿二千三百万伪金圆券。其换发对象为自一九三八年至一九四四年发行之四种英美金债票，这些债票原系人民在国民党政府命令下被迫以黄金、白银及外币等或以法币折合外币缴购，而国民党政府则曾允诺以现金、外汇清偿者，现在国民党政府则一律在“换发”名义下，根本取消了人民收回这些金、银、外币的权利，或按照较稳定的外币价格取得偿还的权利，而换为以正在迅速贬值的伪金圆券纸币为单位的所谓“整理公债”。而且按原来发行规定，这些外币公债均很快到期而应予以全部清偿。但国民党政府现在却要换以所谓“整理公债”，而这“整理公债”的清偿日期，则推延到五年、十年甚至二十年以后。这样，随着时间的推移，伪金圆券的贬值，这次“整理”的结果，象上述的“清偿”一样，人民手中的“整理公债”便无形中转入到四大家族财库中去了。这又是蒋介石玩的大掠夺魔术之一。
