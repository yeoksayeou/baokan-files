From the 9th, the congress successively heard reports from representatives Yang Xiufeng and Song Shaowen on the government work of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee over the past two years, a military report from representative Nie Rongzhen on the North China Military Region over the past two years, a suggestion report from representative Bo Yibo on behalf of the CCP North China Central Bureau regarding the policy guidelines for the North China Liberated Area, as well as explanations from representatives Yang Xiufeng, Xie Juezai, and Rong Wusheng on the drafting process and spirit of important legal drafts such as the "North China People's Government Organizational Outline Draft," "Village, County, and City People's Representative Election Regulations Draft," "Village, County, and City People's Regime Organization Regulations Draft," and "North China Liberated Area Provisional Agricultural Tax Regulations Draft." The representatives submitted a total of 1,180 proposals.

The representatives participated in various committees or groups, engaging in detailed and heated discussions. On the 16th, the congress heard and discussed the review reports of various review committees and groups, and voted on various laws and proposals. At this point, the election of members of the North China People's Government began. The congress decided that the number of government members would be 39, reserving 12 vacancies to adapt to the development of the North China situation, so that representatives from the soon-to-be-liberated areas could jointly participate in the government.

The entire congress process fully embodied the patriotic, democratic, and united front, and the spirit of democratic unity regardless of race, party affiliation, belief, gender, or occupation, to fight for the complete overthrow of the rule of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries in China.

On the evening of the 19th, the congress victoriously concluded amidst enthusiastic cheers.
