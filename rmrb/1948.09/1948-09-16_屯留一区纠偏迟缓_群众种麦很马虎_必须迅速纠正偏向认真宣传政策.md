　　[Taiyue Telegraph] A correspondent from our branch reported: In individual villages in Tunliu First District, because deviations have not been corrected, the masses do not know how to proceed with work after the autumn harvest, and cadres have abandoned leadership over production, so wheat planting is very sloppy. For example, in Xijia Village, some land was plowed once, and some was finished with plowing and planting at the same time. Very little fertilizer was applied; generally, only three to five dan of manure were applied per mu, and some applied only one or two bean cakes. From the start of sowing on August 23rd until it rained on the 1st, over 280 mu had already been planted, accounting for one-third of the village's wheat land. The reasons for this phenomenon are as follows: (1) Correction work has not been carried out; class status has not been determined in the village. Among the 40-odd households that were struggled against, only a few were rich peasants; the vast majority were middle peasants. Two of the households that were struggled against still do not have housing and are experiencing difficult living conditions. Therefore, the masses still have doubts about the policy, do not know how to proceed after the autumn harvest, and are afraid that if they plant, they will not be able to harvest, so even good land left uncultivated by rich peasants is not dared to be planted. Work in the village cannot be promoted either; in recent months, not only can mass meetings not be convened, but even cadre meetings cannot be held. (2) Cadres are passive and speak negatively, saying, "Party rectification will eliminate administrative orders, making work difficult," and abandoning production leadership. Only the village chief and deputy village chief are still doing work, but because they are attending meetings and receiving training, they have not been able to focus on leading production. The production committee has not made specific plans or arrangements for the masses' wheat planting work; some military dependents lack seeds, fertilizer, and labor, and their problems are not being solved. It was not until the evening of September 1st that they made a self-criticism, stating that they would strengthen production leadership. (3) There is more land than labor in the village. The entire village has over 40 qing of land and over 150 households, with only 130 male full and semi-laborers. Each laborer has to cultivate over 30 mu of land. There are only 28 draft animals, and over 30 military dependent families need labor assistance. Last year, mutual aid teams were organized, but because wages were not settled, they have disbanded. Moreover, women have not been organized to work in the fields, so the labor shortage cannot be resolved. Based on this situation, the Taiyue Xinhua Daily publishes a short commentary today, calling on all regions to eliminate ideological obstacles in the Three Autumn Campaigns. It first states: According to recent reports, some masses in Yangcheng Fourth District are afraid of equal distribution after the autumn harvest and are not diligently collecting manure. Some middle peasants in Tunliu are afraid of requisitioning and compensation after the autumn harvest and are not diligently producing, saying that if they plant, they are afraid it will be requisitioned in the future. Middle peasants in Liangzhuang, Qinshui, are unwilling to apply more fertilizer, saying that they cannot guarantee who it will be distributed to after the autumn harvest. In Guo Daozhen, Qinyuan, some people even wrote letters asking, "When will our district have equal distribution?" These facts prove that because correction work has not been done well or has not been done at all in some places, coupled with poor publicity work, some of the masses still have great doubts about local land adjustments after the autumn harvest. They still have a knot in their hearts, which affects production work. This is a key issue that will determine whether our Three Autumn Campaigns can be carried out well and whether we can harvest more grain next summer, and it should be given sufficient attention. Secondly, it is stated that land reform in our district has been largely completed, and land rights have been largely determined. If adjustments are needed, only local or individual adjustments will be made after the autumn harvest, and there will never be another equal distribution, and the land and property of middle peasants will never be infringed upon. These things have been repeatedly announced. The current problem is how to publicize these policies to the masses. This requires using concrete facts to explain the policies and stating that these policies will never be changed after the autumn harvest. Wheat planting has already begun, and time is of the essence. We must quickly take effective measures to eliminate ideological obstacles in the Three Autumn Campaigns.

### 屯留一区纠偏迟缓　群众种麦很马虎　必须迅速纠正偏向认真宣传政策

　　屯留一区纠偏迟缓
  　群众种麦很马虎
  　必须迅速纠正偏向认真宣传政策
    【太岳电】分社记者报导：屯留一区个别村，因为偏向没纠正，群众不知秋后怎样干工作，干部放弃对生产的领导，所以麦子种的很潦草。如西贾村，一部分地犁了一遍，有的连犁带种一下就完了。上粪也很少，一般每亩只上三、五担粪，有的只上了一两个豆饼。八月二十三日开始下种到一日下雨以前，已经种好二百八十余亩，占全村麦地的三分之一。形成这种现象的原因有以下三个：（一）纠偏工作没有进行，村中没有划过成份，被斗的四十多户中，只有三几家是富农，绝大部分是中农，有两家被斗户现还没有房住，生活困难。因此群众对政策还有怀疑，不知秋后怎样干，怕种上收不上，以致富农荒下的好地没人敢种。该村工作也推不动，近几月来，不只群众会召集不起来，就是干部会也开不成。（二）干部消极，说二话：“整党要取消行政命令，工作不好干”，放弃生产领导。只有正副村长还作工作，但因开会受训，也没顾上领导生产。生产委员对群众的种麦工作，没有具体计划和布置，有些军属缺种子肥料，没有劳力，也得不到解决。直到九月一日晚上才作了检讨，要加强领导生产。（三）村中地多劳力少，全村共有四十多顷地，一百五十多户人家，只有男全半劳力一百三十人，每个劳力要种三十多亩地，只有二十八头能种地的牲口，有三十几家军属需要劳力帮助。去年组织了互助组，因没有清理工资，已经散了，又没有将妇女组织起来上地，这样劳力困难就解决不了。太岳新华日报根据这类情况，于本日发表短论，号召各地扫除三秋运动的思想障碍。首称：据近日报载阳城四区有少数群众怕秋后平分，不好好闹粪。屯留有些中农怕秋后抽补，不好好生产，说种上怕将来抽走。沁水梁庄中农不愿多上粪，说秋后还保不住分给谁。屯留西贾村群众因不知秋后怎样干，地犁一遍就马马虎虎将麦子种上了。沁源郭道镇更有人写信来问“我区何时平分？”………这些事实，证明因有些地方纠偏没作好或没有作，加上宣传工作太差劲，一部分群众对秋后局部调剂土地还有很大怀疑，他们胸中还积着一块心病，以致影响了生产工作。这是我们三秋运动能不能搞好，明年夏季能不能多收粮食的一个关键，应引起我们足够的重视。其次说明了我区土改已大体完成，地权已大体确定，如有需要调剂者，秋后只作局部调剂或个别调剂，绝不再来一次平分，绝不侵犯中农的土地财产……。这些已再三再四宣布了，目前的问题是如何将这些政策宣传到群众中去，这就要拿出具体事实来解释政策，说明这些政策秋后绝不变更。现在种麦已经开始，时间是一刻千金，要迅速采取有效的办法，扫除三秋运动的思想障碍。
