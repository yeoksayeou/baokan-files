Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: According to a Nanjing dispatch in the July 14th Tianjin Xin Xing Bao (New Star News): All technical workers under the Tianjin-Pukou Railway system in Pukou and Puzhen, to resist the Kuomintang reactionary government's hunger policy and demand the full payment of arrears in rice subsidies, broke out in an "unprecedented transportation technicians' strike" on July 2nd, with over 5,000 people participating. The strike was triggered by the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau's Puzhen Machine Factory's three thousand-plus technicians demanding improved treatment, which the bureau ignored. Consequently, the bureau's Puzhen Machine Factory, Pukou Station, Power Plant, Water Plant, Machine Factory, Ferry, Locomotive Depot, and other ten-plus units declared a strike at approximately 9:00 AM on the 2nd, and dispatched over twenty representatives to negotiate with the bureau, putting forward four demands: (1) Allow each person a temporary advance of 10 million yuan for July; (2) Immediately issue the one stone and four dou of rice owed from May and June; (3) Retroactively pay the 140,000-fold amount of wages owed from June, plus an additional 30%, totaling 182,000-fold, to be issued according to the index; (4) In addition, issue a monthly rice subsidy of seven dou, and ensure no future arrears. When the strike began, all trains on the line were suspended, and the ferry between Xiaguan and Pukou was also halted. Transportation was interrupted, even the Chiang bandit army's transportation command headquarters could not cross the river. All telephones, water, and electricity were also interrupted. Awed by the power of the striking workers, the bureau finally signed and agreed to the workers' four demands at approximately 7:00 PM. By 8:30 PM, all transportation, after eleven hours, was restored.

　　反抗国民党政府饥饿政策
  　津浦路五千技工大罢工
  　阻断列车轮渡等交通达十一小时
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据七月十四日天津新星报南京通讯：浦口、浦镇两地津浦铁路所属一切机构之枝工，为反抗国民党反动政府饥饿政策，要求补足欠发米贴，于七月二日爆发“空前未有之交通技工大罢工”，参加者共达五千余人。罢工系因津浦路局浦镇机厂三千余技工要求改善待遇，局方置之不理而起。于是该局浦镇机厂、浦口车站、电厂、自来水厂、机工厂、轮渡、机务段等十余单位即于二日晨九时许宣告罢工，并推派代表二十余人向局方交涉，提出四项条件：（一）七月份准许每人暂时借支一千万元；（二）将五六两月份欠米一石四斗即日发下；（三）追补六月份欠发工资十四万倍之金额，另加三成之金额，共计十八万二千倍，准依指数发下；（四）此外发每月七斗米贴，以后不要欠帐。当罢工开始时，全段列车停驶，下关至浦口之轮渡亦告停航。一时交通中断，甚至蒋匪军运指挥司令，亦未能渡江。其他一切电话、自来水、电灯亦告中断。局方慑于罢工工人之威力，方于下午七时许签字答应了工人四项要求。至八时半，经过十一小时之一切交通，始告恢复。
