　　Imam He Qikuan
  　Introducing People's Representatives of North China, Part Two
    Imam He Qikuan is a people's representative elected by representatives of the Hui people from various counties in southern Hebei, and was elected to the presidium of the North China People's Representative Conference. He is one of the most eye-catching representatives. He feels that attending this conference is a glory for the entire Hui people. He said, "This time, the Hui people have separately elected seven representatives to participate in the conference, and there are also Hui people participating in the conference presidium. This is unprecedented in the history of the Hui people."

    He praised the land reform, saying, "Among the Hui people, landlords and rich peasants account for only two or three percent of the total population. Land reform is beneficial to the Hui people. During the land reform, the Han people distributed a lot of land to the Hui people. As a result, 60 percent of the Hui people in southern Hebei have risen to become middle peasants." He also expressed great appreciation for the CCP's policy of developing industry and commerce, saying, "Most of the Hui people do small businesses. Small loans and the organization of cooperatives are very beneficial to them. The saltpeter tanning industry in Linqing has recovered a lot, and most of it is run by the Hui people." He said excitedly, "We have always been called 'poor Hui people.' In the future, as long as we follow the Communist Party's policies and develop industry and commerce well, the Hui people will no longer be poor." In his capacity as a Hui representative, he suggested to the conference the establishment of a Hui Language Institute to train Hui teachers and the establishment of more Hui primary schools in various places to improve the knowledge of the Hui people and promote Hui culture.

    He compared the different positions of the Hui people in the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas with emotion, saying, "In the liberated areas led by the Communist Party, the Hui people have obtained true ethnic equality. However, the Kuomintang oppressed the Hui people and tried to assimilate the Hui people. Chiang Kai-shek himself denied that the Hui people were a nation. Incidents of insulting and残害ing the Hui people occurred constantly in various parts of the Chiang-controlled areas. In the past, there were large-scale massacres of Hui people in the Northwest. The 'Little Pig Bajie' case, which caused a sensation before the War of Resistance against Japan, was an example." (Note: Before the War of Resistance against Japan, the journal run by Kuomintang Railway Minister Zeng Zhongming published a novel insulting the Hui people called 'Little Pig Bajie,' which meant that the Hui people were descendants of Pig Bajie, so they did not eat pork, etc. This aroused opposition from Hui people in various places.)

    Imam He felt honored that the Hui people in various parts of the liberated areas actively participated in the People's Liberation Army and enthusiastically supported the war in order to defend national equality, defend land and democratic rights. He said, "In Zhangluji, Weixian County, which has a total of six or seven hundred Hui households, there are more than fifty revolutionary military families; and the number of Hui people who voluntarily participated in the war and carried stretchers in various places is countless." He was very satisfied with the freedom of religious belief in the liberated areas. Recently, he suggested building a祠堂 (ancestral hall) for Comrade Ma Benzhai, the Hui detachment leader (Ma was a Communist Party member who led the Hui people in various parts of North China to fight alongside the Han people during the War of Resistance Against Japan), to commemorate this banner of the liberation of the Hui people in North China and promote the heroism of the Hui people.

　　回民教长何其宽
  　华北人民代表介绍之二
    何其宽教长是冀南各县回民代表推选的人民代表，并被选入华北人民代表大会主席团。他是最引人注目的代表之一。他感到这次出席大会是整个回民的光彩。他说：“回民这次单独选出代表七人参加大会，大会主席团还有回民参加，这在回族历史上是空前未有的。”
    他赞扬土地改革说：“在回族中，地主富农占总人口不过百分之二或三，土地改革对回民有利。在土地改革中，汉人分给回民许多土地，冀南回民百分之六十因此上升为中农。”他对中共发展工商业政策也极表赞扬，他说：“回民大都做小买卖，小本贷款和组织合作社，对他们好处多。临清硝皮业恢复了不少，大部是回民开的。”他兴奋地说：“我们向来被人叫做‘穷回回’，今后只要照共产党方针好好发展工商业，回民就不穷了。”他并以回民代表资格，向大会建议成立回文学院，培养回民师资，各地多设回民小学，提高回民知识以发扬回族文化。
    他感慨地将回民在解放区和国民党统治区所处的不同地位加以对比说：“在共产党领导的解放区，回民获得了真正的民族平等。而国民党却是压迫回民，力图同化回族的。蒋介石本人就否认回族是一个民族。蒋管区各地侮辱残害回民的事件不断发生，过去西北大量屠杀回民，抗战前轰动一时的‘小猪八戒’案（按：抗战前国民党铁道部长曾仲鸣办的刊物上，登着一篇污辱回民的小说叫‘小猪八戒’，意思是说回民是猪八戒的子孙，所以不吃猪肉等。引起各地回民的反对）就是例子。”
    何教长对解放区内各地回民为保卫民族平等、保卫土地和民主权利，踊跃参加解放军和热情支援战争感到光荣。他说：“共有回民六七百户的威县张鲁集，就有五十多户革命军人家属；各地回民自愿参战抬担架的，更是不计其数。”他对解放区信教自由，甚为满意。最近他更建议给回民支队长马本斋同志建立祠堂（马是共产党员，抗战时期领导回民在华北各地与汉人并肩作战），以纪念这个华北回民解放的旗帜来发扬回民的英雄主义。
