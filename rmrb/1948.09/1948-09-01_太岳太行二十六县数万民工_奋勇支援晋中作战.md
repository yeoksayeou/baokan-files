　　[Jinzhong Electric] During the Jinzhong Campaign, tens of thousands of liberated civilian laborers and militia from 26 counties in Taiyue and Taihang enthusiastically supported the front lines. They traveled hundreds of miles to the front, undertaking intense combat support tasks, and demonstrating the fine traditions of the liberated area people's heroic struggle and hard work. After the Battle of Xiaochang, the third detachment of civilian laborers from Gaoping was supposed to be replaced by the fifth detachment; however, they all refused to leave, saying, "The front is the same as the rear." On July 15th, when the front urgently needed ammunition, the civilian laborers from Yangcheng braved the frantic bombing of five enemy planes and transported ammunition twice in a row. Han Fugui, the company commander of the militia from Wuxiang, and his deputy calmly delivered ammunition to the soldiers during intense fighting, persisting until the battle ended. When civilian laborers from Yangcheng, Zuoquan, Gaoping, Wuxiang, and other counties encountered rain while transporting ammunition, they used their own clothes and straw hats to cover the ammunition. Hao Caiming, a civilian laborer from Wuxiang, carried a colored flag all the way while trying to find boiled water, and took out his own money to buy eggs for the wounded. Bi Mancheng, a civilian cook, was stationed in Xiangyuan Village, Taigu, and delivered meals to civilian laborers more than 30 miles from the front line. Li Baoquan, a militiaman from Qin County, detoured hundreds of miles from Rencun, Taigu, to Liwan, Qi County, to deliver letters, completing the glorious task twice. The civilian laborers and the masses in the new district had a good relationship. During breaks in the fighting, civilian laborers from Yangcheng, Xiangyuan, Zuoquan, Gaoping, and other counties helped the masses in the new district with weeding, hoeing, carrying water, and sweeping the courtyard, winning the support of the masses in the new district. The civilian laborers also implemented mass discipline and city discipline very well. Civilian laborers from Gaoping paid 100 yuan for breaking a villager's bowl. The seventh company of the Tunliu militia was assigned to guard Taigu City, and although the streets were full of items left behind by the enemy, no one took anything. They not only completed their due tasks but also captured many fleeing enemy soldiers and seized a lot of weapons. Wang Denglin, the militia company commander from Changzi, captured nine bandits and three Japanese soldiers in Rencun, killed a Japanese squad leader, and seized three rifles. According to incomplete statistics, the militia and civilian laborers from Qin County, Xiangyuan, Zanhuang, Gaoyi, Xingtai, Neiqiu, Yuanshi, and other counties captured more than 200 enemy soldiers (including three Japanese), killed one Japanese squad leader, and seized two machine guns, more than 150 rifles, four pistols, eight small cannons, 100 grenades, 3,781 bullets, 50 mountain artillery shells, two pairs of binoculars, and one telephone.
