　　[Taiyue Telegraph] The Yicheng Third District Ganquan Base Point Work Group went deep into the mountain villages to inspect and solve the difficulties in wheat planting in the mountain villages. The residents of Ganquan administrative village live very scattered. In order to understand the difficulties of the masses in wheat planting in various mountain villages, the work group recently went deep into the natural villages to conduct inspections and found that two problems in six natural villages, including Shifo, hindered wheat planting. First, the preferential treatment for military families and cultivation on their behalf was very chaotic. The village head, militia, and agricultural association executive committee members did not comply with the duty of cultivating on behalf of military families. Second, some poor farmers had not yet planted wheat because they did not have enough wheat seeds. The work group then convened a meeting of cadres and group leaders from various villages to explain the "Service Draft" of the Administrative Office regarding the methods of cultivating on behalf of military families, review the work of cultivating on behalf of military families, conduct criticism, and discuss how to solve the problems of cultivating on behalf of military families and the lack of wheat seeds. After discussion, it was proposed: (1) Past accounts were unclear and a general settlement would be made after the autumn harvest. From today onwards, a new account would be established. All male full and half laborers in the village, whether cadres or militia, aged between twelve and sixty, would be responsible for the duty of cultivating on behalf of military families. (2) Seven households of military and cadre families in the village who lack labor and have difficulties must be helped with an additional fourteen laborers and twenty-five livestock, according to the current need for wheat planting, to ensure timely planting. The responsibility should first be borne by those who have not served in the past. (3) 400 catties of wheat should be taken from the existing temple property and lent to households lacking wheat seeds for planting, to be returned after the autumn harvest. After these problems were solved, the wheat planting work immediately proceeded smoothly, and the masses were happy to cultivate on behalf of military families.

　　[Taiyue Telegraph] After rectification and correction of deviations in Yicheng Nanma Village, the emotions of the masses from all strata have stabilized. This time, wheat planting has achieved "deep plowing and abundant manure." Last year, only over one hundred mu of the village's eight hundred mu of wheat land was plowed twice, and the rest was planted after only one plowing. But this year, half of the eight hundred mu of land has been plowed three times, and half has been plowed four times, plowing deeply and finely. Last year, very little manure was applied, with an average of more than twenty loads of manure per mu, and more than two hundred mu of land was planted without manure. But this year, in addition to applying thatch and manure to the land, they also cut artemisia to make manure, bedded sheep, applied bean cake, mixed seeds with oil, and applied beans, with an average of about fifty loads of manure per mu, and even eighty loads per mu in some cases.

  　深入山庄解决种麦困难
    【太岳电】翼城三区甘泉基点工作组深入山庄，检查与解决了山庄种麦中的困难。甘泉行政村居民住得很分散，工作组为了解各山庄群众种麦困难，最近深入到各自然村进行检查，发现石佛等六个自然村有两个问题妨碍种麦。一是优军代耕非常混乱，闾长、民兵、农会执委都不服代耕勤务。二是有些贫农因为麦籽不够，还没种上。工作组随即召集各闾干部、小组长会议，讲解行署“服勤草案”中优军代耕办法，检讨代耕工作，开展批评，讨论如何解决代耕和麦种缺乏的问题。经过讨论，提出：（一）过去差帐不清，秋收后作一次总清算，从今天起另立新帐。全村无论干部、民兵，凡是十二岁以上六十岁以下的男全半劳力，一律分别负担优军代耕勤务。（二）全村七户没劳力有困难的军、干属，根据现在种麦需要，必须再帮人工十四个，牲口二十五个，使能保证按时种上。首先从过去没服勤的负担起。（三）从现存的庙产内拿出四百斤麦子，借给缺麦种的户种麦，秋后归还。这些问题解决后，种麦工作立即顺利进行，群众也就高兴代耕了。
    【太岳电】翼城南马村经过整党纠偏，各阶层群众情绪安定，此次种麦做到了“犁深粪饱。”去年全村八百多亩麦地，犁两遍的才有一百多亩，其余都是一遍就种上了。但今年八百亩地，一半犁过了三遍，一半犁了四遍，犁的又深又细。去年上粪很少，平均每亩上粪二十多担，有二百多亩地没上粪就种上了。但今年除把茅粪地粪都上到地外，还割蒿沤粪、卧羊、上豆饼、油拌籽、上豆子等，平均每亩上粪约五十担，甚至有上八十担的。
