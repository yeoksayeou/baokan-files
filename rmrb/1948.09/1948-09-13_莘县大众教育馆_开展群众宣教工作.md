[Jinan Telegram] The Xin County Public Education Center is dedicated to carrying out mass propaganda and education work, and has achieved considerable results. The center has a reading room with more than 600 books and three newspapers. In addition to being open on market days, it is also open at any time according to the masses' production leisure. In addition, since the establishment of the center more than a year ago, it has actively engaged in the following social education activities: Eleven male literacy classes and twelve women's literacy groups were organized in the four villages in the town, with teachers from Shilong Elementary School and a dozen students taking primary responsibility for teaching. Two tests of the women's literacy organization proved that most of them could recognize more than 100 characters, and some could recognize more than 200 characters, which actively promoted the mass literacy movement. Folk artists were organized into three ballad singing groups, who completely sang new lyrics. In addition to performing in the county, they also went to Guanxian and Wuxun areas to carry out mass propaganda activities, and influenced and transformed the old artists in the area. A painting class was established to transform the technology of temple painters. Nearly a hundred street murals were painted in the four villages of the town and in the market towns of the second district, to cooperate with production, land reform and the development of the situation for propaganda. In addition to regularly publishing blackboard newspapers, reprinting current news and local production conditions, government decrees, etc., the center has also added a loudspeaker since the beginning of spring to broadcast news every evening after dinner, combined with the ballad singing group, to give lectures and propaganda on market days. In addition, there are mass writing and inquiry offices to write letters for military families and the masses, and to forward manuscripts to newspapers. During the New Year's holidays, five temporary theater troupes and three Yangko teams were also organized to promote policies and decrees through various forms of folk entertainment, which were very popular among the masses.
