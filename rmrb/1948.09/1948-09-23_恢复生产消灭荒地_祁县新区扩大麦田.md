　　Restore Production and Eliminate Wasteland
  　Qixian New District Expands Wheat Fields
    [Jinzhong Electric] White Dew has passed, and it is the season for planting wheat. Party, government, and civilian cadres in Qixian are making every effort to mobilize the masses in the Qixian area to restore production and expand wheat fields by 200,000 mu. The new district aims to restore the acreage of wheat fields to the level before Yan's bandits implemented the so-called "soldier-peasant integration," while the old district aims to reach the 1946 wheat planting level, ensuring that each person plants two to two and a half mu of wheat. To solve the difficulties of the masses in the new district in planting wheat, the democratic government has allocated a special loan of 4 million and 100 dan of seeds, to be distributed to the 3rd, 5th, and 6th districts, which were the most severely looted by Yan's bandits. Currently, cadres in various districts have gone deep into the countryside to mobilize the masses, adjust land, and strive to complete the arduous task of expanding wheat planting as soon as possible.
    [Jinzhong Electric] The broad masses in the newly recovered areas on both sides of the Tongpu Road South Baijin Line in Qixian County, after abolishing Yan's bandits' "soldier-peasant integration" and regaining the right to cultivate their own land, are actively engaged in restoring production and rebuilding their homes. In the Zi Hongkou Liuhegou area of the former Second District, under the brutal rule of Yan's bandits for less than half a year, a large amount of land was deserted, with over 15,000 mu of cultivated land and 10,200 mu of uncultivated land lying fallow. Farmers who had been robbed and scattered before have successively returned to production and rushed to plant crops and settle their families. The democratic government has helped them solve the problems of means of production and livelihood, and people from all walks of life have displayed their enthusiasm for labor and have begun to cultivate the barren land. Farmers in Liang Village praised the People's Liberation Army and thanked the democratic government as soon as they picked up their rice bowls, saying, "If the local emperor (referring to Yan's bandits) hadn't been overthrown, how could us ordinary people have food to eat?" "When Yan's bandit army was around, the grain harvested belonged to them, and the faces of the people were all yellow. Since the People's Liberation Army came, the grain harvested belongs to us, and the wives and children are all rosy-cheeked." In a short period of time, the masses in Liang Village rushed to plant 120 mu of naked oats and eliminated 138 mu of wasteland. The masses in the entire district put forward the slogan "The front eliminates Yan Xishan, the rear eliminates wasteland," mobilizing men and women to eliminate wasteland and replant late crops in large quantities. According to statistics from 16 villages in the Second District, a total of 2,380 mu of naked oats and 1,040 mu of millet were replanted, and more than 1,800 mu of wasteland was eliminated. The masses in this district have a tradition of mutual aid labor and have confidence in restoring production and rebuilding their homes. They said, "Our land is very rich, and with the leadership of the democratic government, it will be turned around in less than two years." Women and children in many villages have all set out to pull up weeds and prepare to expand wheat planting. The waterlogged land in Gaobei Village has now been plowed twice, more than 80% of the wheat fields in Shentangtou and Wanglianzhuang have been plowed, and more than half of the land in the 20 villages of Sunjiahe in Wuhezhuang has been plowed. After the democratic government promulgated measures to reward reclamation, the masses in the entire district are mobilizing all full and semi-labor forces to focus on planting wheat, preparing to eliminate 10,000 mu of wasteland. The democratic government also guarantees the safety of life for those fugitive landlords who were afraid of struggle during the land reform in the border areas in the past after they return home, and distributes land to them, so that they can settle down and produce.

　　恢复生产消灭荒地
  　祁县新区扩大麦田
    【晋中电】白露已过，正是种麦的季节。祁县党政民干部正以全力发动祁区群众恢复生产，扩大麦田二十万亩。新区要恢复阎匪实行所谓“兵农合一”以前的麦田亩数，老区达到一九四六年种麦水平，作到每人种麦二亩到二亩半。为解决新区群众种麦困难，民主政府特拨贷款四百万，种子一百石，分发给遭阎匪抢掠最重之三、五、六区。现各区干部已深入农村发动群众，调剂土地，争取早日完成扩大种麦的艰巨任务。
    【晋中电】祁县同蒲路南白晋线两侧广大新恢复区群众，在废除了阎匪的“兵农合一”重新获得耕种自己土地的权利以后，正积极从事恢复生产重建家园。原二区子洪口六合沟一带农民，在阎匪横暴统治下未及半年，土地大量荒芜，熟荒达一万五千余亩，生荒一万二百亩。以前被劫逃散的农民，相继归来生产抢种，安置家务。民主政府帮助他们解决生产资料与生活资料，各阶层群众发扬劳动热忱，开始在荒芜的土地上进行耕种。梁村农民一端起饭碗就拥赞解放军，感激民主政府说：“要不打倒了土皇帝（指阎匪），咱老百姓还能有饭吃？”“阎匪军在时打下粮食是人家的，老百姓脸都是黄腊腊的，解放军来了，打下粮食是自己的，婆姨娃娃都吃的红光光的。”梁村群众在短期内曾抢种莜麦一二○亩，消灭荒地一三八亩。全区群众提出“前方消灭阎锡山，后方消灭荒地”口号，动员男女劳动消灭荒地，大量补种晚庄稼。据二区十六个村统计，共补种莜麦二三八○亩，抢种小谷一○四○亩，消灭荒地一千八百余亩。该区群众原有互助劳动习惯，对于恢复生产重建家园都具有信心，他们说：“咱这片地面顶富足，有民主政府领导，用不了二年就翻过来了。”许多村庄妇女儿童都一齐出发拔蒿除草，准备扩大种麦。郜北村水地现已耕过二遍，神堂头、王联庄麦地已翻百分之八十以上，五合庄孙家河二十村翻地已在一半以上。民主政府颁布奖励开荒办法以后，全区群众正动员所有全半劳动力突击种麦，准备消灭一万亩荒地。过去在边沿地区土改时畏惧斗争的逃亡地主返家后，民主政府亦同样保障其生命安全，并分给他们土地，使他们安心生产。
