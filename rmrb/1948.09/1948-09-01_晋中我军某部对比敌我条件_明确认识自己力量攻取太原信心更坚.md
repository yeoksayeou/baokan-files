(Taixing Electric Telegram) In the Jinzhong front, the eighth squad of combat hero Li HaiShui of a certain unit of our field army, in evaluating the victory in the Jinzhong campaign and rectifying their thinking, the soldiers used their own experiences and the specific facts they were most familiar with to analyze the ten major comparisons between the enemy and ourselves. This helped them to more clearly recognize their own strength and the enemy's corruption, find the reasons why we can win battles, and strengthen their confidence in capturing Taiyuan. This is a new creation in the army's mass political rectification. The materials of the ten major comparisons can not only serve as a reference for political rectification in their unit, but also as a reference for the current affairs study of participating militiamen, laborers, and the masses in the rear. The details are as follows:

(1) In terms of weapons, since the Linfen and Jinzhong campaigns, we have annihilated more than 100,000 of Yan’s regular troops, obtaining thousands of large and small artillery pieces. Now we have more weapons and ammunition than the enemy.

(2) In terms of troop strength, each enemy company has only 30 to 50 soldiers, all of whom want to desert and are unwilling to fight. Our army's companies are all at full strength. In the Dachang annihilation battle, one of our companies was able to wipe out four or five enemy companies.

(3) In terms of the number of the masses, almost the entire Shanxi is about to be liberated. We have the support of the people of Shanxi. Yan Xishan now only rules over hundreds of thousands of people in the isolated city of Taiyuan.

(4) In terms of materials and supplies, we have supplies from the rear. Yan Xishan is trapped in an isolated city, and his supplies and ammunition are limited, like water in a stagnant pit, which will be exhausted after being used up.

(5) In terms of morale, our soldiers are all here to defend their emancipated fruits or their own liberation, and their fighting is brave and tenacious. The enemy is forcibly conscripted and fundamentally opposes fighting, and they are defeated as soon as they fight.

(6) In terms of war support, our militiamen, laborers, stretcher teams, etc., are all volunteers, transporting ammunition on the front line and rescuing the wounded. The enemy randomly grabs ordinary people on the battlefield, and the people slip away at any opportunity, abandoning the wounded soldiers.

(7) In terms of combat, we are actively attacking fortified positions, and we can fight whenever we want, and the troops can take turns to rest. The enemy is on the defensive, with few troops, and has to defend the city fortifications day and night, getting no rest at all.

(8) In terms of relations with the masses, we protect the interests of the people, and we buy and sell fairly wherever we go, not taking a needle or thread from the people. The masses welcome us. The Yan bandit army robs things wherever they go, beating and oppressing the masses, causing opposition from the masses.

(9) Officer-soldier relationship: In the People's Liberation Army, officers and soldiers are united and friendly, and are completely equal politically. In Yan's army, there is oppression at every level, high-ranking officers bully low-ranking officers, and soldiers bully the common people. They oppose each other, and therefore have no strength.

(10) Comparing the Liberated Areas with the Yan-occupied areas, the people in the Liberated Areas all have land to cultivate and houses to live in, living in peace and working happily, with freedom and happiness. In Yan's controlled areas, one must have "three major certificates" to go out, otherwise they are "disguised." Strong men are all arrested, and the land is barren. Countless people starve to death or are forced to death. This is the reason for Yan's inevitable demise.

　　晋中我军某部对比敌我条件
  　明确认识自己力量攻取太原信心更坚
    【太行电】太原前线我野战兵团某部战斗英雄李海水连八班，在评晋中胜利战役与整顿思想中，战士们以亲身经历的和自己最熟悉的具体事实，研究出敌我十大对比，更明确地认识了自己力量和敌人的腐败，找到我们所以能打胜仗的原因，坚定了攻取太原的信心。这是部队群众性政治整训的一种新的创造。十大对比材料，不仅可作为其部队政治整训中的参考，而且也可作为参战民兵民工及后方群众时事学习的参考。兹特介绍如下：（一）从武器上来比，我们自临汾和晋中战役以来，共歼灭阎匪正规军十万余人，得大小炮数千门，现在各种武器弹药比敌人都多。（二）从兵力上比，敌每连是三十人至五十人，还都是想开小差，不愿打仗的，我军各连则都是满员的。在大常歼灭战中，我一连能消灭敌四、五个连。（三）从群众多少来比，全山西都快解放了，我们得到全山西人民的拥护，阎锡山现只统治太原孤城的几十万老百姓。（四）物质上、给养上来比，我们有后方接济，阎锡山困守孤城，给养和弹药有限，好比死水坑道的水一样，吃完就没有了。（五）士气上来比，我们的战士都是为保卫自己翻身果实或自己的解放而来的，作战是勇敢顽强的，敌人是编组强行抓来的人根本反对打仗，一打就败。（六）战勤上来比，我们的民兵民工担架队等都是自愿出来的，在火线上运送弹药，把伤员救下来，敌人则在战场上乱抓老百姓，老百姓抽空就溜，伤兵都扔了。（七）从作战上来比，我们是主动的攻坚战，想什么时候打就什么时候打，队伍能替换着休息；敌人是防御战，兵力又少，昼夜都得死守城碉，一点得不到休息。（八）从群众关系方面来比，我们是爱护人民利益的，走到哪里都是公买公卖，不拿人民一针一线，群众都欢迎我们；阎匪军则走到哪里都是乱抢东西，打骂压迫群众，引起群众反对。（九）官兵关系：解放军是官兵一致，团结友爱，政治上完全平等的；阎匪是一级压一级，大官欺小官，当兵的欺侮老百姓，互相反对，也就没有力量。（十）解放区与阎占区来比，解放区的群众是人人有地种，人人有房住，安居乐业，自由幸福；阎匪统治区一出门就要“三大证”，否则即是“伪装”。壮丁都抓走，土地都荒芜，饿死逼死的人就不知道有多少，这就是阎匪必然死亡的原因。
