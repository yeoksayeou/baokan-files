[JiluYu Electric] Chengwuxian County has suffered severe flooding, with six out of eight districts in the county inundated. The average reduction in autumn grain harvest for the entire county is expected to be more than half. In some areas, the land is completely submerged, making wheat planting very problematic, and wheat seeds are also scarce. Some people are selling cattle and donkeys due to lack of food, which would further hinder wheat planting. Failure to plant wheat will exacerbate the famine. To address this, the county government convened a meeting of cadres from various districts to study how to organize production in disaster areas, overcome the famine, and tackle wheat planting issues. After discussions, the following decisions were made: (1) Actively assist the masses in flood control, conduct in-depth investigations of the disaster situation, and mobilize the masses to avoid fleeing the famine as much as possible, or at least to plant wheat before fleeing, otherwise the famine next year will be even more unbearable. (2) Strengthen the relationship between the government and the people, enhance rural unity, and call for the development of a "people love the people" movement. (3) Mobilize the masses to collect and store edible wild vegetables, leaves, tree bark, fine bran, as well as grain chaff, grass seeds, hemp seeds, and cottonseed to prepare for the famine, and promote a thrift campaign. Organize the masses to develop sideline production. (4) Systematically eliminate wasteland and plant more wheat, calling for the coordinated use of draft cattle, with cattle from irrigated land lent to those with dry land for plowing, and compensation provided in the form of fodder. After the water recedes, cattle from dry land will help plant wheat in low-lying areas. All land that can be planted must be planted early and extensively. (5) Make every effort to accumulate and apply more fertilizer. If one's own land is flooded and cannot be planted, one can plant wasteland on higher ground. Whoever plants the wasteland gets the harvest and is exempt from rent. (6) Distribute relief loans and funds to support production, overcome the famine, and facilitate wheat planting.

　　灾区种麦有困难
  　城武县府研究解决办法
    【冀鲁豫电】城武县水灾严重，全县八个区有六个被淹，全县秋粮平均要减收大半。有的地方满地是水，种麦很成问题，麦种也困难。有的因没吃的要卖牛驴，如果卖了就更影响种麦。种不上麦，灾荒将更严重。为此，该县政府特召集各区干部开会，研究如何组织灾区生产，渡过灾荒和种麦等问题。经大会讨论决定：（一）积极帮助群众治水，深入调查灾情，动员群众最好不逃荒，少逃荒，即便逃荒也必须种上麦子，否则明年的灾荒更不堪设想。（二）密切政民关系，加强农村团结，号召开展“民爱民”运动。（三）发动群众将能吃的野菜、树叶、树皮、细糠及谷秕、草子、麻种、棉子等集藏起来，准备渡荒，开展节约运动。组织群众发展副业生产。（四）有计划的消灭荒地多种麦子，号召调剂使用耕牛，水地牛借给干地的来耕地，可给以草料的报酬。水下去再以干地的牛帮助洼地种麦，凡能种上的地一定要早种多种。（五）想尽一切办法多积肥多施肥，自己的地有水种不上，可种高岗上的荒地，荒地谁种谁收不纳租。（六）发放赈贷粮款扶助生产渡荒和种麦。
