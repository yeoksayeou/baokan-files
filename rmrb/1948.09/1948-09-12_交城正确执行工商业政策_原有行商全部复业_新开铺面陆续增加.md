　　[Jinzhong Telegram] Jiaocheng's urban industrial and commercial sectors originally included 92 workshops and shops, such as handicraft workshops, stores, fur shops, Chinese medicine shops, and general merchandise stores. After liberation, with the support of the democratic government, all of them resumed business in just one month. Moreover, one stationery store, one inn, one hospital, two general merchandise stores, five restaurants, 34 stalls, and dozens of mobile vendors were newly added. Merchants who had fled under the tyrannical rule of the Yan bandit regime have also returned to open businesses. The Dongshahe Market has been established. The trading center near the city关 (guān, gate/pass, can also refer to a city gate area), the number of vendors and people attending the market exceeds twice the number during the period of bandit occupation. During the Yan bandit's rule, there were numerous heavy taxes, and the burden on industry and commerce was extremely heavy. In addition, the practice of integrating soldiers and merchants was implemented, with two out of every six people being drafted as standing soldiers, and the remaining people doing hard labor every day, building projects, digging trenches, and carrying bricks, making it impossible for various businesses to operate. After the democratic government entered the city, it resolutely implemented the policy of protecting industry and commerce. When accepting materials from the Yan bandit's government-run stores, it strictly distinguished the private shares within them. For example, cloth from the Jinquanchang store that was deposited in the Yan puppet grain and tax office was returned after verification. For private businesses and private shares in public enterprises, as well as private shares and private property of Yan puppet personnel who fled due to oppression by the Yan bandits, the democratic government properly protected them and posted announcements explaining that the original amounts were sealed up and entrusted to their neighbors or relatives for safekeeping, waiting for them to return and claim them. For example, the Grain Joint Cooperative, Cultural Supply Cooperative, Cultural Service Cooperative, and People's Transportation Cooperative run by the Yan bandits, the government has announced that all private property still belongs to the individuals. For example, the eight packages of Kang Shaoxu from Duancun stored in the Grain Joint Cooperative remained untouched. Kang took them all away after finding a witness. At the beginning of liberation, merchants still had some doubts about the democratic government's industrial and commercial policies. After the government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce repeatedly explained and interpreted them, the cadres of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce visited each household. At the same time, they stabilized prices, established grain stores to regulate people's food, and issued loans of 15 million yuan (farmers' currency) to coal kilns, which can now produce 12,000 catties of coal per day. Various industries in the urban area have successively opened for business, and the market is becoming increasingly prosperous. At the beginning of liberation, farmers' currency was extremely scarce, and transactions were mostly done with grain, and even silver dollars were used, causing market chaos. Later, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce established a Jinzhong Grain Store outlet and supplied various daily necessities, which increased the credibility of the farmers' currency and lowered prices. From July 11th to 21st, the price of one foot of white cloth dropped from 60,000 yuan to 28,000 yuan in ten days. The price of a towel dropped from 130,000 yuan to 60,000 yuan. One catty of white flour dropped from 30,000 yuan to 16,000 yuan. One dou of millet, which used to cost 300,000 yuan, can now be bought for 160,000 yuan. Other prices have also been greatly reduced compared to before. Saltpeter used to be controlled by the Yan bandits, and each catty of saltpeter was only given 20,000 yuan in Chiang's currency, which could only buy a pack of cigarettes. Now all saltpeter workshops are privately operated. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce purchases it for 20,000 yuan in farmers' currency per catty, which can buy two catties of wheat. The enthusiasm of the workers for production has greatly increased. Zhang Zhisheng, a shoemaker in Dongguan, said: "In the past, I worked hard for others every day and still had to go hungry. Now I can make four pairs of shoes a day, and each pair of shoes can earn 30,000 yuan in labor costs. My family has enough to eat and even has some left over." The People's Transportation Cooperative was preparing to close down when it was first liberated, and the original 70 catties of gasoline were also sold to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. After the Bureau of Industry and Commerce explained that the gasoline was converted into 8.69 million yuan, they used the money to buy a cargo truck and continued to operate.

　　交城正确执行工商业政策
  　原有行商全部复业
  　新开铺面陆续增加
    【晋中电】交城城关工商业，原有作坊商店皮货行药材行杂货行等九十二家。解放后在民主政府扶植下仅一个月即全部恢复营业，且新增文具行、店房、医院各一家，杂货行两家，饭铺五家，摊贩三十四家，流动摊贩数十家，在阎匪暴政下逃走的商贩也都回来开张营业。东沙河市关集已成立。城关附近的交易中心，摊贩与赶集的群众超过匪占期间二倍以上。阎匪统治时苛税繁多，工商业负担极为严重，加以实行兵商合一，六人中抽二人当常备兵，其余的人每天做苦工、修工事、挖壕沟、背砖头，使各商号无法营业。民主政府入城后坚决执行了保护工商业的政策，在接受阎匪官办商店物资时，严格分清其中的私商股份。如晋泉昌商号寄放在阎伪钱粮行的布匹，经证实后即退还。对因受阎匪欺压而逃亡的私人商号及公营企业中的私人股本，以及阎伪人员的私人股本，私人财物，民主政府均妥为保护，并张贴告白说明原数封存，交其邻人或亲友代管，等他们回来领取。如阎匪办的粮联社、文化供应社、文化服务社、民众旅运社等，政府已宣布所有私人财物仍归本人所有。如段村康少煦存放在粮联社的八个包袱原封未动，康找到证明人即全部取走。初解放时商人们对民主政府的工商业政策还有些怀疑，经政府工商局反复说明解释，工商局干部挨门逐户的进行访问，同时平抑物价，设立粮店调剂民食，发放煤窑贷款一千五百万元（农币），现每日可出煤一万二千斤。城关各业陆续开张营业，市面日趋繁荣。初解放时农币极缺，交易多用粮食，甚至使用白洋，造成市场混乱现象。后经工商局设立晋中粮店门市部，并供给各种日用品，农币威信提高，物价也随之下降。七月十一日至二十一日十天内白洋布一尺由六万元减至二万八千元。毛巾每条由十三万元降至六万元。一斤白面由三万元降至一万六千元。小米三十万元一斗现在十六万元即可买一斗。其他物价均较前大为降低，盐硝过去受阎匪统制，每斤硝只给蒋币两万元，仅能买一支纸烟，现在所有硝房都由私营。工商局收购每斤给二万元农币，可买二斤小麦。工人们生产情绪大为提高。东关做鞋工人张之盛说：“过去天天给人作苦工，还得饿肚子，现在一天可揽四双鞋，一双鞋可赚手工钱三万元，一家人吃饭还有余。”民众旅运社刚解放时准备停业，原有七十斤汽油也卖给工商局，轻工商局解释将汽油折价八百六十九万元后，又用此钱买了一部货物，继续经营起来。
