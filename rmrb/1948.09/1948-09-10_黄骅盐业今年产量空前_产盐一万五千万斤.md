[Jizhong Electric] Huanghua County (newly established county, formerly belonging to the Bohai Liberated Area, assigned to Jizhong in early August) has 120 *li* of coastline and is a famous salt-producing area in North China. With the support of the democratic government, the county is expected to produce 150 million *jin* of salt this year, more than any previous year. The county produces four types of salt: the first is called "Da Qing Salt," which is sun-dried from seawater, with over 270 salt fields and more than 3,100 salt workers. Small fields cover 50 or 60 *mu*, while large fields cover more than 300 *mu*. Each field employs 10 to 35 salt workers. The second type is called "Well Field," also known as "Er Salt," which is produced by drawing water from wells and sun-drying it. The third type is called "Leaching Field," also known as "Small Salt," which is produced by leaching salt-rich soil with well water and then sun-drying it; this type of work can be done even by semi-able-bodied people. The fourth type is "Boiled Salt," which is the same as the boiling method used in Hejian and Renqiu in Jizhong. In Huanghua County, many women and children make a living from the salt industry. This year, the salt workers are doing better than in previous years, with some earning as much as 100 *shi* of grain, and others earning 20 or 30 *shi*. Before the "July 7th Incident," during the Kuomintang rule, anyone who wanted to produce salt had to go through "procedures," pay taxes, and be subject to "exclusive purchase." The salt farmers worked extremely hard and lived a very difficult life. After the People's Liberation Army liberated the county in 1938, the democratic government vigorously supported the salt industry. At the Bohai Land Conference last winter, a policy was established to further develop the salt industry. The government provided 1.25 million *jin* of grain and 60 million yuan (North Sea currency, same below) in loans to 3,050 salt farming households. The Huanghua County Committee assigned 11 cadres to organize a salt farmers' union preparatory committee to lead the opening of salt fields and absorbed more than ten experienced and public-spirited veteran "Niantou" (old "Niantou" are skilled workers in the salt industry who can tell how much salt is in the water and direct the workers' work) to help with the leadership. Initially, the salt farmers had many ideological concerns, fearing that the government would buy the salt at a low price, that the loans would not be enough, that there would not be enough seawater, and that bandits would cause trouble, etc. After repeated mobilization and loan support, these concerns were gradually dispelled. On the eighth day of the first lunar month this year, the salt farmers' union mobilized everyone, saying: "The army is going to fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive. We must rush to the beach and turn the alkaline land into gold." When the salt farmers arrived at the beach, they were all worried when they saw the endless alkaline land and mud. Director Zhang of the county, and others, took the lead in assigning rivers and fields, influencing the salt farmers to go down to the fields together, and the work of assigning rivers and fields was completed in three days. On the sixteenth day of the first lunar month, 1,652 salt workers began to dig rivers, completing 21,715 cubic *fang* of earth in five days. By March 27th, 176 new salt fields had appeared. After the seawater came in with the tide, the newly dug rivers were filled with water, and both new and old fields produced salt at the same time.

The cadres of the salt farmers' union preparatory committee worked with the salt workers and conducted education in the fields during breaks. Because many new fields were opened, and there were few "Niantou", the cadres educated the "Niantou" to direct three to five fields each and paid attention to taking apprentices. This year, 300 new "Niantou" have been trained, solving the difficulty of a lack of technical personnel. Some salt workers still had the misconception of being "struggled against" for becoming rich. The union cadres explained to them our party's policy of developing production and becoming rich, proposing: "More sweat, more rivers dug, more water coming in, more salt produced, more grain and money sold." These ideological concerns were gradually dispelled.

The lives of the salt workers have greatly improved. Old "Niantou" Zhao Kuiyu said: "I have worked in 'Changlu Beach' for more than 40 years and have nothing left. Seeing the good times now, my heart is blooming." They all felt that they had truly turned over. Cao Guiquan, a Hui Muslim from Yang'erzhuang, earned six sacks of wheat, nine sacks of corn, and 100,000 yuan. He married a wife, bought a donkey, paid off his old debts, and still had enough grain to eat. Salt farmers added new furniture to their homes. In the past, they used dippers to draw water, but this year they added two waterwheels, 3,919 rocking waterwheels (water dragons), and lever water dippers. Since this spring, they have also added 700 mules.

During the "May Day" Labor Day, the salt workers launched a "model evaluation," "model selection," and "model award" campaign, resulting in eight model fields and 148 model salt workers. From March to June, the salt workers averaged 20,000 *jin* of salt each. Large carts from six counties, including Dongguang and Huimin, went to transport salt, and the salt transportation industry developed along with the salt industry. Initially, smuggling was very serious, but after discussion among the members, it has been greatly reduced.

Currently, the salt farmers in the county have a high enthusiasm for production and are actively requesting to open new fields after the autumn harvest. Some are automatically assigning fields. They said: "The old officials (referring to the Kuomintang authorities) have never done such a good thing!" They asked to dig large rivers and deepen and widen the old rivers. The Huanghua County Committee is actively planning to develop sea salt, mobilizing salt workers from "leaching fields" and "well fields" to operate "sea salt," and plans to formally establish the salt farmers' union to more effectively lead the salt farmers' work.

　　黄骅盐业今年产量空前
  　产盐一万五千万斤
    【冀中电】黄骅县（新设县，原属渤海解放区，八月上旬划归冀中）沿海岸一百二十里，为华北著名产盐区。在民主政府扶植下，该县今年约产盐一万五千万斤，比过去那年都产的多。该县产盐分四种：一种叫“大青盐”，用海水晒成共有二百七十多付滩，三千一百多盐工。小滩占地五、六十亩，大滩占地三百多亩。一个滩有盐工十多人到卅五人。第二种叫“井滩”，又名“二盐”，是在地里掘井汲水晒成的。第三种叫“淋滩”，也叫“小盐”，以井水在盐土上淋过晒成，这种活半劳力也可以作。第四种是“熬盐”，和冀中河间、任邱等地的熬法一样。黄骅县妇女、儿童多以盐业为生，今年盐工的光景比那年都好，一个人最多的可赚一百石粮食，少的也赚二、三十石。在“七七事变”前国民党统治时期，谁要晒盐得办“手续”，纳捐税，还得“专买”。盐民劳动极重，生活很苦。一九三八年人民解放军解放该县后，民主政府即大力扶植盐业。去冬渤海土地会议上，确定了进一步发展盐业的方针。政府以一百二十五万斤粮食及六千万元（北海币，下同）贷给三千零五十户盐民。黄骅县委抽出十一个干部，组织盐民工会筹备会，领导开滩工作，并吸收十多个晒海盐有经验、热心公益的老“埝头”（老“埝头”是盐工里的技术工人，能看出水里有多少盐，指挥工人工作）帮助领导。最初盐民们还有许多思想顾虑，怕晒出盐来政府低价收买；怕贷的款不顶事；怕海水不够用；怕海匪扰乱等等。经过反复动员和贷款扶植，逐渐打破了这些顾虑。今年旧历正月初八，盐民工会动员大家说：“军队要打到南京去，活捉蒋介石。咱们要跑到海滩边，把海滩碱地变成金”。盐民们到了海边，对着一眼看不到边的碱地和稀泥，都发了愁。县里张科长等带头号河、号滩，影响盐民们一齐下了滩，三天就完成了号滩、号河工作。正月十六日，一千六百五十二个盐工开始挑河，五天完成二万一千七百十五方土。到三月二十七号，出现了一百七十六付新滩。海水上潮后，新挑的河里＠满了水，新滩和老滩同时出了盐。
    盐民工会筹备会的干部，工作时和盐工一起工作，休息时到各滩进行教育。因为新滩开的很多，“埝头”又少，干部就教育“埝头”每人指挥三个到五个滩，并注意拉徒弟。今年已培养出新“埝头”三百名，解决了技术人材缺乏的困难。有的盐工还有怕过富了“挨斗”的错觉，工会干部即向他们讲解我党发展生产，发家致富的政策，提出：“出的汗多，挑的河多，来的水多，出的盐多，卖得粮食和票子多”。逐渐打破了这些思想顾虑。
    盐工们的生活大大改善了。老“埝头”赵奎玉说：“我在‘长芦滩’干了四十多年，啥也没有剩下，看到眼下的好光景，心里开了花。”他们都觉着真正翻了身。羊二庄回民曹贵全挣了六口袋麦子，九口袋棒子和十万元。说了个媳妇，买了个驴，还完了陈帐，粮食还够吃。盐民们家家户户都添了新家具。过去都是用斗子提水，今年添了水车两辆，摇水车（水龙）三千九百十九辆，和杠水斗子等。今春以来还增加了骡子七百头。
    过“五一”劳动节的时候，盐工们开展了“评模”“选模”“奖模”运动，出现了八个模范滩，一百四十八个模范盐工。三月到六月盐工们平均每人得到二万斤盐。东光、惠民等六个县的大车都去拉盐，运盐业随着盐业发展而发达了。最初走私很严重，通过会员讨论以后，已大大减少。
    目前该县盐民生产情绪很高，积级要求秋后开新滩。有的自动去号滩。他们说：“老辈官家（指国民党当局）从来没办过这么好的事！”他们要求挑大河，把旧河加深、加宽。黄骅县委积极筹划发展海盐，动员“淋滩”“井滩”的盐工去经营“海盐”，并计划把盐民工会正式成立起来，更有力的领导盐民工作。
