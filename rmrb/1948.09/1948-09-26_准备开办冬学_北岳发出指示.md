　　Preparing to Launch Winter Studies
  　North Yue Issues Instructions
    [North Yue Telegram] The North Yue Administrative Office and the District Party Committee issued instructions on holding winter studies, stating in brief: Our district's land reform work has been completed. In order to stabilize the countryside, develop production, and further improve the political and cultural level of the masses, winter studies should continue to be held this year. To this end, the following decisions are made: (1) This winter, from November 1st to the end of February next year, winter studies should generally be held in all consolidated areas. However, two different organizational forms can be adopted according to the different objects: For adult and elderly masses, the focus is on strengthening political education, without emphasizing cultural learning. The content should center on the two documents "A Summary of the Two Years of the People's Liberation War and the Tasks for the Third Year" and "Take the Agricultural Production of the Liberated Areas a Step Further," with the addition of instructional materials from the Administrative Office and the District Party Committee regarding local work (especially production teaching materials). The District Party Committee will soon issue an outline as a reference for lectures. Primary school teachers should become the teachers of winter schools. Villages without primary schools can hire other teachers. In order to improve the understanding level of winter school teachers, counties and districts should conduct short-term or temporary instruction for winter school teachers. At the same time, it is encouraged that district cadres go to the countryside to give lectures for winter schools. In addition to participating in political classes, young men and women should be specially organized to conduct cultural learning, and literacy competitions can be launched among young people. Attention should be paid to turning cultural learning into a regular habit, that is, during busy farming seasons, it should be adhered to as much as possible without affecting production, so as not to forget what has been learned. In places where the New Democratic Youth League has been established, the Youth League should take organizing and leading youth learning as its regular and important task. (2) All localities should attach importance to the leadership of winter studies. The government's education departments, the Party's propaganda departments, and the farmers' associations, youth federations, and women's federations should jointly form a winter studies committee. The Party branch should take strengthening the political education of the masses and organizing the political and cultural learning of young people as one of its regular tasks; calling on Party members and cadres to play a model leading role in learning and become active members in winter studies. The progress of winter studies should be reported to the higher authorities regularly by all departments, and communications should be organized for publication in newspapers. (3) Government organs and schools should help and guide the villages where they are stationed to do a good job in winter studies. (4) All localities should immediately start to arrange and prepare, requiring that classes start on time and proceed according to plan.

　　准备开办冬学
  　北岳发出指示
    【北岳电】北岳行政公署和区党委发出举办冬学的指示，略称：我区土地改革工作已经完成，为了安定农村，发展生产，进一步提高群众的政治文化水平，今年的冬学，应该继续举办。为此，特作如下决定：（一）今年冬季从十一月一日至明年二月底，各巩固地区应一般的开办冬学，但可根据不同的对象采取两种不同的组织形式：对壮年老年群众主要是加强政治教育，不强调文化学习。内容以“人民解放战争两周年总结和第三年的任务”，“把解放区的农业生产提高一步”两个文件为中心，斟酌增加行署区党委关于当地工作之指示材料（特别是生产教材）。区党委即将编发提纲，作为宣讲的参考。小学教员应成为冬学的教员，无小学的村庄可另聘。为了提高冬学教员的认识水平，县区应进行冬学教员短期或临时传授。同时提倡区干部下乡为冬学讲课。青年男女除参加政治课外，应特别组织他们进行文化学习，并可在青年群众中展开识字的竞赛，应注意把文化学习变成一个经常的习惯，即在农忙期间也应在不影响生产下尽可能坚持下去，以免忘掉。已成立新民主主义青年团的地方，青年团应该把组织领导青年的学习作为自己经常和重要的任务。（二）各地应重视冬学的领导，由政府的教育部门、党的宣传部门，和农会、青联、妇联共同组成冬学委员会，党的支部应该把加强群众的政治教育，组织青年群众的政治文化学习，作为自己经常的任务之一；号召党员、干部在学习中起模范带头作用，成为冬学中的积极分子。冬学进行情况，各部门要向上级定期报告，并组织通讯在报纸上发表。（三）机关学校要帮助和领导驻在村庄搞好冬学。（四）各地应即着手布置和准备，要求准时开学，并按计划进行。
