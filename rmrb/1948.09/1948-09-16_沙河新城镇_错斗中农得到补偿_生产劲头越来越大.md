[Taihang News] Shahe New Town has completed the correction of errors and ended land reform, with the entire village united in developing production. In last year's land reform, the interests of middle peasants were harmed, with 24 out of 42 households struggled against being middle peasants. In January of this year, a work team arrived in the village to carry out democratic rectification of the Party and made some corrections, but because the work was not thorough, the middle peasants still had doubts about the policy. Furthermore, the emphasis on returning the original items to the middle peasants also made the poor and hired peasants uneasy, as they thought what they had been allocated was not guaranteed. Everyone was unclear about the policy, and production enthusiasm was low. Houses were not repaired when they were damaged, and the land was not cultivated well. At the beginning of last month, the village branch and the People's Congress, in accordance with the spirit of the District Party Committee's May meeting, implemented the correction of errors, corrected wrongly determined class status, and separately returned and compensated wrongly accused middle peasants and settled landlords and rich peasants. Land, houses, livestock, farm tools, clothing, grain, etc., were all carefully compensated and adjusted. After the compensation, a village-wide unity meeting was held to explain the policy of ending land reform and turning to production, so that everyone understood that the land reform in the village had been thorough and that the future direction was to boldly develop production, with land ownership determined, free buying and selling, and each person's labor belonging to themselves. After this announcement and explanation, the masses had a clear understanding of the policy, and their doubts were dispelled. Yao Gejin said, "If the policy is like this, I will cultivate my land well." Yao Zhangshan said, "It won't work if it's like last winter (referring to the chaos after the establishment of poor and hired peasant groups), people would try to take away the land I worked hard for with my wheelbarrow, who would have the heart to work?" Yao Qingyu, a middle peasant who was wrongly struggled against, said, "My livestock was struggled against, but this time I was compensated, and I will buy a mule!" The masses understood the Party's policy, and their enthusiasm for production has increased, and they have been buying livestock and opening workshops to vigorously develop production. In the past month, one new grain store, one flower workshop, and one meat workshop have been added. Twenty-seven new livestock have been added, including five bought by middle peasants who were compensated and had their class status changed. Twenty-two houses have been repaired, and even more new houses have been built. Mutual aid is now being reorganized in preparation for the autumn harvest. (Guang Xue)

　　沙河新城镇
  　错斗中农得到补偿
  　生产劲头越来越大
    【太行讯】沙河新城镇完成纠偏结束土改，全村团结发展生产。该村去年土改中曾损害了中农利益，全村斗了四十二户有二十四户是中农。今年一月工作组到村进行民主整党，作了些纠偏工作，但因作得不彻底，中农对政策仍有怀疑，又因强调退回中农原物，影响到贫雇翻身户也不安，以为分的东西没保障。大家都对政策不摸底，生产情绪不高，房子坏了也不修补，地也不好好种。上月初，该村支部和人代会，依照区党委五月会议以后的精神，贯彻纠偏，改正错订成份，分别退补错斗中农安置地富。土地、房屋、牲口、农具、衣服、粮食等，都进行了认真的补偿与调剂。补偿以后，召开了全村的团结大会，说明结束土改转上生产的政策，使大家了解本村土改已彻底，今后方向是放手大胆发展生产，地权确定，买卖自由，各人劳动都归自己所有。这样宣布讲解之后，群众对政策有了清楚的认识，疑虑打消，姚圪金说：“政策要是这样吧，我可要把我的地种好。”姚掌山说：“要象冬天那样（指去冬成立贫雇组后的混乱）就不能过了，我推小车闹下的地，人家就也要动我哩，谁还有心干？”错斗中农姚青玉说：“斗了我的牲口这次又补了我，我还要买个骡子哩！”群众了解了党的政策，生产劲头越来越大，纷纷买牲口、开作坊大搞生产。一个月来计新添粮店一座、花坊一座、肉坊一座。新添牲口二十七头，其中补偿与改订成份后的中农买了五头。修房二十二间，新盖房的更多。现正整顿互助，积极准备秋收。　　　（广学）
