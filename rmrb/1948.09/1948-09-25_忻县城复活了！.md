　　Xinxian City is Revived!
    Shu Ting
    After being oppressed and exploited by the Japanese and Yan regime for twelve years, Xinxian City was recovered by our army on July 20th, and 230,000 people in the county were liberated. After our army entered the city, it strictly implemented our Party's correct policy for newly recovered cities. With the support of the people and the efforts of all comrades in the Party, government, army, and civilians, the market order stabilized after more than ten days of control, most of the industry and commerce resumed business, the "soldier-peasant integration" tyranny was abolished, and grain and seeds were loaned, wasteland was reclaimed, and the poor were aided, which won praise from the majority of citizens and people from all walks of life.
    Our Army Enters the City with Strict Discipline
    After our army entered the city, it was strictly disciplined and adhered to the strict discipline of not taking a single needle or thread from the people. Individual violations of city discipline occurred, such as the cavalry company confiscating a private hospital. After it was discovered, the unit was immediately ordered to return everything and compensate for the loss of 10 million yuan (currency of the Jin-Sui Peasant Bank). The company's instructor is preparing to punish them. Some people took away some personal items left by the enemy and puppet organs, and the city defense troops immediately stopped and corrected them. They were kind and amiable to the people. Those who were previously deceived by Yan's bandits and were afraid of our Party and our army now say: "We have never seen such a good army."
    Correct Implementation of Lenient Policy
    After entering the city, the Public Security Bureau established police stations in various streets. In addition to issuing announcements, mass meetings were held in various districts to announce our Party's lenient policy. It was announced that as long as the puppet personnel registered and declared their residential address, they would be conditionally restored to freedom. As a result, within five days of liberation, more than 1,000 Yan bandit personnel came to register. They gratefully said of the lenient policy: no one was killed, few people were detained, and they felt that they had been fooled by Yan Xishan.
    Citizens Help Me Search for Supplies
    After I announced that the masses in Chengguan should hand over the enemy and puppet's hidden and abandoned military materials, the citizens enthusiastically helped me search, and they reported it themselves, searching for a lot of military weapons and other military supplies from basements, wells, fire pits, and toilets. According to preliminary statistics, more than 170,000 bullets alone were collected, and thousands of stones of grain.
    Four Doors Open Wide · The Eighth Route Army Brings in Wealth
    The democratic municipal government continued to employ most of the original street office personnel, except for a few who were most dissatisfied by the masses, and they worked under the leadership of the democratic government. In order to gradually restore the prosperity of the market and facilitate cultivation, the east and west gates, which had been closed by the enemy for several years, were opened for traffic. The citizens were extremely happy. An old man, Li Liansheng, said: "The 'soldier-peasant integration' divided my land, and I had no choice but to set up a small stall. Later, I couldn't afford to donate money, so I had to work for others. A soldier from the 39th Division and his wife planted my land. This time the soldier and his wife left, and my land is back. I came in from the east gate and went out from the west gate, circling around. It's really 'four doors open wide, the Eighth Route Army brings in wealth.'"
    Explicitly Protect Industry and Commerce
    There were originally sixteen lines of business in Xincheng, with more than 500 companies. Under the heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies of Yan's bandits, many large businesses closed down, leaving only 266 stalls, pharmacies, and dim sum shops, and more than 130 small vendors. More than 70 shops and more than 200 small vendors were forcibly transferred outside the city by Yan's bandits. When the enemy fled, they looted the merchants, and some had already suspended business. As soon as our army entered the city, it explicitly ordered the protection of industry and commerce. After a few days of propaganda and contact, they were all willing to resume business quickly. We listened to the merchants' voices and agreed to move the market from outside the city back to the city, and divide the market in the city to restore the market. Now the merchants are returning one after another. What the merchants are particularly concerned about are the landlords and rich peasants in the countryside who have been classified as such, and they doubt whether we will liquidate them. After we explained the industrial and commercial policies, some people immediately expressed their willingness to increase capital. Most of them have resumed business within ten days of liberation. The daily transaction volume is about 100 million yuan. A butcher, Niu Bao, said: "If the Eighth Route Army hadn't come, I would have run away. This time I can live. When Yan Xishan was in power, relatives were not relatives, and six people were not six people. As soon as the sun went down, the streets were like dead people. Now relatives can come, the streets are bustling and lively, the four doors are open, and people can come and go freely, and business can be done. It's really liberated." Under the care and custody of the workers, the electric light company generated electricity as usual on the second day after liberation.
    Abolish the "Soldier-Peasant Integration" Tyranny
    Under the tyranny of Yan's bandits' "soldier-peasant integration," more than 90 hectares of land in Chengguan were abandoned, more than 2 hectares were occupied by enemy fortifications, and the output generally decreased by 30% to 40%. Merchants were also incorporated into the industrial and commercial groups, and three people had to provide a soldier. In addition to the business tax and the same heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies as the peasants, two people had to support one of Yan's soldiers, and each family had to pay at least four jiao of silver (equivalent to 20,000 yuan) in preferential treatment fees every day. Therefore, when our democratic government announced the abolition of the "soldier-peasant integration" tyranny and all heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies under the rule of Yan's bandits, the people were all overjoyed and happily said: "This time we can live!"
    Lend Grain and Seeds to Rush to Plant Wasteland
    In order to prevent the land from being abandoned and to facilitate rush planting, the democratic government decided that the abandoned land and summer stubble land should be cultivated by the original owners (landless people), and the green seedlings should still be cultivated and harvested by the original planters. Those who could not afford to cultivate could be adjusted, and after the autumn harvest, the rent would be reduced and the grain would be distributed. And allow the masses to adjust each other under fair and reasonable conditions. The masses happily said: "The Eighth Route Army does things reasonably and fairly, everyone has land to plant, and they can live in the future." At the same time, seize the opportunity to lend out seeds. Mobilize the masses to rush to plant buckwheat and autumn vegetables, and announce that buckwheat and autumn vegetables are exempt from public grain. A total of 12 shi of buckwheat seeds and more than 10 shi of grain were lent to help poor citizens rush to plant. In the past, the white land around the city has now been transformed into a green field.

　　忻县城复活了！
    舒挺
    被日阎统治压榨了十二年的忻县城在七月二十日为我军收复后，全县二十三万人民获得了解放。我军进城后，严格执行了我党对新收复城市的正确政策，在人民拥护与党政军民全体同志的努力下，经十余日的管制，市面秩序安定，工商大半恢复营业，“兵农合一”暴政废除，贷粮贷种抢荒济贫，获得广大市民与各阶层人士的称赞。
    我军入城纪律严明
    我军进入城后，纪律严明，遵守不拿人民一针一线的严格纪律；有个别违犯城市纪律的，如骑兵连没收一家私人医院，发现后，即令该部将东西全部退回，并赔偿损失一千万元（晋绥农民银行钞票下同），该连指导员正拟处分中。有人拿走敌伪机关留下的一些私人用品，城防部队即马上制止、纠正。他们对人民和和气气。以前受阎匪骗而害怕一我党我军的，现在都说：“咱们没有见地这样好的部队”。
    正确实行宽大政策
    入城后，公安局成立各街派出所，除出布告外，分区召开群众大会，宣布我党宽大政策。宣布伪人员只要登记声明，注明居住地址，即有条件的恢复自由。这样，解放后五天内，来登记的阎匪人员即达千余人。他们对宽大政策感激说：没杀一人，扣人很少，感到是上了阎锡山的当。
    市民帮我搜查物资
    当我通告城关群众交出敌伪隐藏遗弃之军火器材后，市民即热烈帮助我搜查，纷纷自报，从地下室、水井、火坑、厕所中搜寻出不少军火武器及其他的军用品。据初步统计：只子弹一项即搜集十七万余发，粮食数千石。
    四门大开·八路进财
    民主市政府对原街公所人员，除个别为群众最不满者予以撤换外，大部人员继续留职，在民主政府领导下进行工作。为便于逐渐恢复市面繁荣，便利耕作，将敌人封闭数年的东、西二门拆开通行，市民异常高兴，一个老汉李连生说：“兵农合一把我的地分走了，没办法摆了一个小摊子，后来捐款捐的也干不起啦，只好给人家动弹，我的地叫三十九师的一个兵种着，这次那个兵和他老婆走了，我的地又回来了。我从东门进来从西门出去，绕了绕，真是‘四门大开，八路进财’。”
    明令保护工商业
    忻城商业原有十六行，共五百余家，在阎匪苛捐杂税下，很多大商号倒闭，只留下摊贩、药店、点心铺等二百六十六家，小担百三十余个。其中七十余家商号和二百余家小摊贩，被阎匪强制转移城外。敌人逃跑时，对商户实行抢劫，有的已暂停营业。我军一入城，即明令保护工商业，经几天的宣传与接近后，均愿迅速恢复营业。我们听取商家呼声，同意将市场由城外迁回城内，并在城内划分市场，恢复集市。现各商户正纷纷回迁。商人特别关心的是被划为地主富农的乡下财东，怀疑我们是否清算。当我们将工商业政策说清后，有人当场表示愿意增加资本。在解放后十天内已大半恢复营业。每日交易额约十万万元。一个屠夫牛保说：“八路不来，我就准备跑了，这一下可活出来了。阎锡山在时亲家没亲家，六人没六人，太阳一落，街上就象死下人了。现在亲家也能来了，街上烘烘火火，热热闹闹，四门大开，自由往来，买卖能作了，真是解放了。”电灯公司在工人爱护保管下，解放后第二日，即照常发电。
    废除“兵农合一”暴政
    在阎匪“兵农合一”暴政下，城关九十余顷土地，荒掉十余顷，敌工事占了两顷多，产量普遍降低百分之三十至四十。商人也被编在工商组内，三个人同样要出一个兵，两个人除出营业税和农民一样的苛捐杂税外，也要养活阎军一个，全家每天每人平均至少要出四角白洋的优待费（合洋二万元）。因而当我民主政府宣布废除阎匪统治下的“兵农合一”暴政与一切苛捐杂税后，人民无不额手相庆，高兴的说：“这下可活出来了！”
    贷粮贷种抢种荒地
    民主政府为了不荒地及便于抢种，决定已荒地及夏茬地归原主（失地人）耕种，青苗地仍由原种地人负责锄耧收割，无力耕种的可调剂，秋收后，按减租分粮。并允许群众在公平合理的条件下互相调剂，群众高兴的说：“八路军办事合情合理，人人都有地种，以后能活了。”同时抓紧机会贷发种籽。发动群众抢种荞麦、秋菜，并宣布荞麦、秋菜免征公粮。计贷荞麦种十二石，贷粮十余石，帮助贫苦市民抢种。过去城周围片片白地，现已变为绿色的原野。
