Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: The education cause in the Northeast Liberated Areas has achieved great development. According to recent preliminary statistics, there are currently 17,726 primary schools in the entire Northeast, an increase of 72.4% compared to the same period last year. The number of students is 1,688,446, an increase of 90.8% compared to last year. The number of primary school students in some provinces has increased by more than 150% compared to the puppet Manchukuo period. There are 125 middle schools, with 59,481 students and 2,229 teachers, an increase of 20 schools, 19,416 students, and 645 teachers compared to last year. In addition to those run by various provinces, there are more than ten institutions of higher learning, including the Northeast Academy of Sciences, Northeast University (formed by the merger of the original Northeast University and Jilin University), China Medical University, Military and Political University, Railway College, and Postal and Telecommunications School, with over 10,000 students. This tremendous achievement is the result of the democratic government's efforts to restore and develop school education and timely correct errors in its work. One of the main reasons for the sharp increase in the number of students is the economic and educational liberation of the laboring people. For example, the number of primary school students in Songjiang Province was 88,471 last year and 171,082 this year, an increase of 100%, the vast majority of whom are children of middle and poor peasants. Peasant cadre classes have been universally attached to middle schools in various places. In the past, very few middle school students came from poor peasant and farm laborer families, but according to statistics from Songjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, and Liaoning provinces, and Harbin city, they now account for 24.5% of the total. While the doors of schools were opened to the children of the laboring people, they did not refuse students from other family backgrounds to enroll. Leftist errors were once made on this issue, but they have been quickly corrected. The work of reforming the blind Kuomintang "orthodox" ideas of old students and teachers in Northeast schools has achieved great results in the past year. The vast majority of students and old teachers now have a basic stance of serving the people.

　　东北
  　学生学校数目激增
    【新华社东北二十七日电】东北解放区教育事业已获得极大发展。据最近初步统计，全东北现有小学一万七千七百二十六所，较去年同时期增加百分之七十二点四。学生一百六十八万八千四百四十六人，较去年增加百分之九十点八。有些省份的小学生较伪满时增加一倍半以上。中学一百二十五所，学生五万九千四百八十一人，教员二千二百廿九人，比之去年，学校增加二十所，学生增加一万九千四百十六人，教员增加六百四十五人。专科以上学校除各省所办者外，现有东北科学院、东北大学（原东北大学与吉林大学合并而成）、中国医科大学、军政大学、铁路学院、邮电学校等十余处，学生万余名。这个巨大的成绩是民主政府努力恢复和发展学校教育并及时纠正工作中的错误的结果。学生人数激增的主要原因之一是劳动人民在经济上和教育上的解放。如松江省小学生去年为八八四七一名，今年为一七一零八二名，增加了一倍，其中绝大部分是中、贫农的子弟。各地中学校内，已普遍附设农民干部班。过去贫雇农家庭出身的中学生只有极少的一部分，现据松江、合江、嫩江、辽宁四省和哈尔滨市的统计，已占总数百分之二十四点五。当学校大门为劳动人民子弟开放的时候，它并不拒绝其他家庭成份的学生入学，在这个问题上曾经犯过左的错误，但已迅速纠正。改造东北学校中旧有学生和教员盲目的国民党“正统”观念的工作，在过去一年中收到了极大的成效。绝大部分学生和旧教员现在已经具有为人民服务的基本立场。
