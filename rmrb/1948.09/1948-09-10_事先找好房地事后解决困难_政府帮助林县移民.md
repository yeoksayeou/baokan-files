　　【Taihang Telegraph】In order to adjust the people's livelihood and improve social productivity, the Taihang Administrative Office has decided to transfer immigrants in batches from Lin County, Fifth Administrative Region, which has a large population and little land, to Bo'ai County, Fourth Administrative Region, which has a small population and barren land after being devastated by the enemy for a long time. The first batch of immigrants has now been properly settled and has begun to reclaim wasteland. When the Lin County government began to carry out this work, it first sent people to Bo'ai County to make contact and identify suitable houses and land, and then mobilized immigrants. It was planned to move a batch first, gain experience, and then continue to move people after autumn. Because the first batch of immigrants was eager to rush to plant late seedlings, the time was relatively short. Twenty-four poor households from the first, second, fourth, and fifth districts were mobilized first, with one person from each household going to settle down, led by county and district cadres, and they set off last month. The Special Commissioner's Office issued 30 jin of millet per person as travel expenses, and reception stations were set up along the way, with Lin and Bo'ai counties responsible for solving the living difficulties of the immigrants on the road in stages. When they arrived at the Xiasuimo Immigrant Distribution Office in Bo'ai, the local county and district cadres warmly received them, and the accommodation was in tile-roofed houses. The county governments of both sides also sent special personnel to solve the problems of land, farm tools, and utensils for the immigrant households. The Bo'ai branch of the Jinnan Bank loaned the immigrants 350,000 yuan to buy two large cattle. The Bo'ai County government lent each person 120 jin of wheat and 300 jin of seeds. With the problems of living and production basically solved satisfactorily, the immigrants immediately went into production. Each person planted two mu of autumn seedlings, which have now been hoed. It is planned to reclaim another 290 mu of wasteland, ensuring that it will be plowed and sown with wheat this year as soon as possible. After planting the autumn land, some people engaged in sideline production, carrying goods back to Lin County to sell, and visiting relatives and friends in their hometown. The villagers enthusiastically inquired about the situation in the immigrant area. When they heard that the land in Bo'ai was irrigated land and the houses were large tile-roofed houses, and that it was no problem to become rich as long as they worked hard, they all said, "The current government is really doing everything for the masses." Many people are willing to move there as soon as possible. Seven peasant households in Wangzhi Village were helped by the government to move to Bo'ai on the 5th of this month.

　　事先找好房地事后解决困难
  　政府帮助林县移民
    【太行电】太行行署为了调剂人民生活，提高社会生产力，特决定从人多地少的五专区林县，分批移民到被敌长期摧残后人少地荒的四专区博爱县。第一批移民现已妥为安置，开始开生荒。林县县府在开始进行这一工作时，先派人到博爱接洽，看好房子土地，然后动员移民。准备先移一批，取得经验，秋后再陆续迁移。第一批移民因急于赶种晚苗，时间比较仓促，先在一、二、四、五区动员了较穷苦的二十四户，每户先去一人安置，由县区干部带领，在上月动身。专署发给每人小米三十斤作为路费，沿路并设有招待站，由林、博两县分段负责，解决移民在路上的生活困难。到达博爱下水磨移民分配处时，当地县区干部热情招待，安顿的住处都是瓦房。双方县府又派专人解决了移民户的土地、农具、用具等问题。冀南银行博爱支行贷给移民三十五万元，买了大牛两头。博爱县府每人借给麦子一百二十斤，又借出种子三百斤。生活和生产问题大致完满解决，移民立即进入生产。每人种了二亩秋苗，现已锄好。计划再开种荒地二百九十亩，保证最近开完犁好，今年种上麦子。有一部分人种好秋地，又搞起副业生产，担上货物贩回林县来卖，捎带着看老家的亲邻朋友。乡亲们热心询问移民地的情形，听说移到博爱种的是水浇地，住的是大瓦房，只要劳动生产，发家致富是不成问题时，都说：“现在的政府真是为群众为到底了。”有很多人都愿早些移去。王掷庄七户农民，又在本月五日由政府帮助移往博爱。
