Xinhua News Agency Northeast, 22nd: A correspondent reports: How the strongholds stubbornly defended by the Kuomintang bandit troops and the liberated areas outside these strongholds are two different worlds is most sharply manifested in the comparison between Changchun today and the surrounding rural areas of Changchun. While Changchun is plunged into famine because the defending bandit troops refuse to lay down their weapons and carry out ruthless plunder, the boundless fields outside the city are presenting a scene of abundant harvest. The best crop is sorghum, generally over two people tall, with solid ears. Local farmers estimate that each hectare (ten acres) can yield about eight *shi* (approximately 800 kg), and at worst, no less than five *shi*. Although it cannot be said to be a perfect year, it is not far from it. Farmers have now harvested most of the corn, and millet is also beginning to be harvested. The residents of the suburbs, who have suffered from the looting of Chiang bandits and fallen into famine, are overjoyed at the sight of the autumn grain everywhere. In May of this year, when the People's Liberation Army entered the suburbs of Changchun, everything was desolate. The Kuomintang bandit troops robbed the masses of all their grain and property, dragged away herds of livestock, and kidnapped large numbers of young men and women, leaving behind a ruthless famine. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army, while eliminating the Chiang bandits around Changchun, assisted the democratic government in launching a wide-ranging production and disaster relief campaign, providing large amounts of grain and seeds to the masses and mobilizing them to rush planting. Various army units also launched a campaign to save and relieve disaster, and actively helped the masses with rush planting without any compensation. When livestock was insufficient, the soldiers personally pulled plows. A certain unit alone saved 15,000 *jin* of grain, contributed 15,000 labor days, and provided 40 livestock, which were distributed to poor farmers by the government. According to incomplete statistics, 70 percent of the land in the area was saved from being deserted due to the help of the troops in rush planting. In addition, the People's Liberation Army stipulated that each division should grow 350,000 *jin* of vegetables, all of which would be used to relieve the victims of the disaster. In this way, coupled with the full-scale disaster relief efforts of the democratic government, 200,000 disaster victims were finally rescued from the tragic situation of death and dispersal. Subsequently, various departments assisted the democratic government in launching a rush-weeding and rush-cultivating campaign, solving various difficulties such as grain, tools, manpower, and animal power for the masses, thus ensuring the abundant harvest this autumn. The local people are very clear: without the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government, there would be no abundant harvest in the vicinity of Changchun. Therefore, the local people widely spread the saying: "The Central Army harms us to death, and the People's Liberation Army saves us to live." They also expressed their willingness to help the People's Liberation Army quickly take Changchun and rescue the starving citizens of Changchun.

　　孤城内外两个世界
    长春因匪军盘据掠夺陷于饥饿
  　城外辽阔田野上呈现丰收景象
    【新华社东北二十二日电】分社记者报导：国民党匪军困守的据点与据点以外的解放区怎样是两个世界，正在今天的长春和长春周围农村的比较上最尖锐的表现出来。当长春因守城匪军拒绝放下武器并实行残酷掠夺而陷于饥饿时，城外一望无际的田野上正呈现着丰收景象。最好的是高粱，一般都有两人多高，穗头坚实，据当地农民估计，每垧（十亩）地可打八石左右，最坏也当在五石以上；虽不能说是十分年景，但也相差不远。现农民已将苞米大部收割，糜子也已开收。曾饱受蒋匪洗劫而陷于饥饿的城郊居民，眼看着满地秋粮，无不异常欣喜。今年五月，人民解放军进驻长春城郊的时候，到处是满目荒凉，国民党匪军抢光了群众所有的粮食财物，拉走了成群的牲口，抓去了大批青年男女，留下的是无情的饥荒。于是，解放军一面肃清长春周边蒋匪，一面协助民主政府发动广泛的生产救灾运动，大批给群众贷粮贷籽种，动员群众抢种。军队各个单位也掀起了节约救灾的热潮，并无代价地帮助群众积极抢种，牲畜不够，战士们就亲自拉犁，仅某部即节省粮食一万五千斤，帮助人工一万五千个，并拿出牲口四十匹，经政府发给贫苦农民。据不完全统计，该地区百分之七十的土地即系在部队帮助抢种之下，才得免于荒芜。此外解放军又规定每师种卅五万斤菜蔬，全部用以救济灾民。这样，配合了民主政府的全力救灾，终于使二十万灾民从死亡离散的悲惨情况中挽救过来。接着各部又协助民主政府发动抢铲抢趟运动，解决了群众粮食、工具、人力、畜力等各种困难，这样，才保证了今秋的丰稔。当地人民十分清楚；没有解放军和民主政府，便没有这长春近郊的丰收，因此当地人普遍流传着这样的话：“中央军害我们死，解放军救我们活。”他们并纷纷表示愿意帮助解放军迅速打下长春，解救饥饿的长春市民。
