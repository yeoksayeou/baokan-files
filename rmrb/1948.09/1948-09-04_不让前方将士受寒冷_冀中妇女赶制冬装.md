　　Jizhong Women Hastily Make Winter Clothes to Keep Frontline Soldiers from the Cold

　　[Jizhong Electric] As summer departs and autumn arrives, women in various parts of Jizhong are busily making winter clothes for the soldiers on the front lines. More than 200 women from twelve villages near Chengguan in Anping come to the city every day to make winter clothes; on the 19th and 20th, despite the rain, the women still came. They are competing with each other to win the title of model worker. Women from Daliu Village in Shen County challenged women from Raoyang, guaranteeing that their work would not be reworked, that they would not waste a single thread, and that their work would be strong and not deformed. To do more work, the women of Daliu Village eat breakfast every morning and take some dry food to the factory, working until dark. The neighboring villages of Raoyang originally planned to have forty people come from each village, but every day eighty people came from each village; more than 300 came from Wodi Village every day. They said, "When we heard that we were making military uniforms for the soldiers on the front lines, we came before the village assigned us." They worked actively and had made 18,862 military uniforms in seven days. Women in Zhoujiazhuang Village in Jin County made 500 pairs of military socks in ten days. When the military socks were distributed, the women rushed to make them. Grandma Zheng, who was over sixty years old and whose eyesight was so poor that she could hardly see the needle and thread, said, "I can't see to make socks, but I have to make a pair by trading work with others." Many women disliked the cloth issued by the public and took out their own good cloth to replace it. Ling Ai said, "We should do this work even better than we do for our own men. If it weren't for the People's Liberation Army fighting Chiang Kai-shek on the front lines, could we have turned ourselves around? Could we live in peace?" Women in Wuyangpu Village in Shenze County finished 80 pairs of military socks in three days. Under the leadership of women cadres, women in Wangmeizhuang, Gaochuan Town and other villages in Qingcangjiao (newly established county) made more than 480 pairs of military socks in ten days. Grandma Pang made six pairs by herself. When the village cadres assigned Zhao Yu, a woman from Huangpu Village, to make one pair, she insisted on making ten pairs, saying, "Isn't the army fighting hard on the front lines for us, the common people? What does it matter to make a few pairs of socks?" At her insistence, the village assigned her nine pairs. She finished them in ten days.

　　不让前方将士受寒冷
  　冀中妇女赶制冬装
    【冀中电】夏去秋来，冀中各地妇女纷纷给前方将士赶制冬装。安平城关附近十二个村二百多妇女，每天到城内来做冬装；十九、二十两天下着雨，妇女们也冒雨前来。她们为了争取模范，互相展开竞赛。深县大流村妇女向饶阳妇女提出挑战，保证做的活不翻工，不浪费一条线，做的结实不走样。大流村妇女为了多做活，每天早晨吃完饭，拿些干粮就到工厂来，一直做到黑。饶阳邻村等村，本打算让每村来四十个人，可是每天每村都来八十个；窝堤村每天来三百多。她们说：“听说给前方战士做军装，没等村里分派就来了”。她们积极做活，七天中已做好军衣一万八千八百六十二件。晋县周家庄妇女，十天做好军袜五百双。分配军袜时，妇女们都抢着做，六十多岁的郑大娘眼花的已看不清针线了，她说：“我看不见做袜子，给别人换工也得做一双。”好多妇女嫌公家发的布不好，把自己的好布拿出来换上。伶爱说：“咱们做这活，比给自家男人做的还好才算哩。要没解放军在前方打老蒋，咱们能翻身吗？能过安生日子吗？”深泽武羊铺村妇女三天中做完八十双军袜。青沧交（新设县）王美庄、高川镇等村妇女，在妇女干部带头影响下，十天做好军袜四百八十多双，庞大娘一个人做了六双。黄铺村干部分配妇女赵玉做一双，她坚决要做十双，她说：“军队在前方拼死拼活不是为了咱老百姓吗？做几双袜子算什么。”在她坚决要求下，村里分配给她九双。在十天内就做完了。
