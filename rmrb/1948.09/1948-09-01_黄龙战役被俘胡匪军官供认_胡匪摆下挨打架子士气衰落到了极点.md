Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 29th. Zhang Xianjue, the captured Hu匪 (Nationalist soldier) Major General Staff Officer of the reorganized 36th Division during the Huanglong Campaign, recently told reporters that the Hu匪 army lacked the spirit of attack even during offensives, and their morale was extremely low. He said: In this operation, Zhong Song (commander of the 36th Division) advocated: "Not losing soldiers is equivalent to winning a battle." Therefore, what we set up did not look like an "offensive" but rather a defensive posture. And after your army seized Hutishan, Zhong Song led a few guards and fled without notifying anyone. He also said: "Since our (referring to the Hu army) defeat in the Jingwei Campaign, we have been under attack on three sides. To the east, we have to defend against western Henan; to the south, we have to defend against southern Shaanxi; and to the north, we have to defend against your army. Your army is completely in an active position and can take northern Wei to the south, enter Jingwei directly to Baoji, and advance into Hanzhong. Our troops are insufficient, and defense is extremely difficult. Everyone feels that the future is bleak. After this loss of troops, it will be even more difficult to maintain the trapped situation." Zhang is from Yunxi County, Hubei Province, 42 years old, and has served as the Chief of the Military Staff Office of the 90th Army (i.e., the reorganized 90th Division), and the Chief of the First Section of the Staff Office of the 39th Army Group Headquarters of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters. He was captured on the evening of the 9th in the Yijing area, more than ten miles north of Chengcheng. At that time, Zhang tried to conceal his identity, discarded his diary on the roadside, and claimed to be a platoon leader. When the People's Liberation Army soldiers found a telegram addressed to him as Chief of Staff Zhang in his pocket, he could not deny it.

　　黄龙战役被俘胡匪军官供认
  　胡匪摆下挨打架子士气衰落到了极点
    【新华社西北前线二十九日电】在黄龙战役中就俘之胡匪整编三十六师少将参谋长张先觉，顷对记者谈，胡匪军作战就是在进攻中也没有攻击的精神，士气衰落到了极点。他说：在这次作战中，钟松（三十六师师长）的主张就是：不损兵折将，就等于打了胜仗。所以我们摆的就不象“攻势”，乃是挨打架子。而当贵军夺取壶梯山后，钟松就带领几名卫士不通知任何人先行逃跑了。他并说：“我们（指胡军）自泾渭战役失败后，即三面受敌，东要防豫西，南要防陕南，北要防贵军。贵军完全站在主动地位，南可取渭北，西可入泾渭直下宝鸡，进取汉中。我们兵力不足，防御极感困难，大家都觉得前途黯淡。此次损兵折将后，就更难维持困守的局面了。”按张系湖北郧西县人，四十二岁，曾历任匪九十军（即整编后之九十师）军参谋处长，西安绥署三十九集团军总部参谋处第一科科长等职。九日晚在澄城北十余里之义井地区就俘。当时，张曾图掩藏身份，将其日记本抛弃路旁，并自称排长。当解放军战士从他的口袋中搜出一署衔为参谋长张之电报时，彼始无法狡赖。
    【新华社西北前线二十九日电】解放军在黄龙战役俘获之胡匪三十六师高级军官中，现又查出有一六五旅四九四团少将团长陈涟堤，师少将高级参议李秀＠，上校政工处长尚庭豫，师参谋长三课上校课长吴连海，国防部战地视察团第九组上校视察官马国荣等五人。
