Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 30th -- Zhang Dexin, Acting President of Changchun University under the Kuomintang, unable to bear the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, resolved to dedicate himself to the democratic education cause in the liberated areas. On June 3rd, he and university staff member Wu Ziyi risked their lives to cross the Kuomintang military defense line, escaped from the dark and hopeless Changchun to the liberated area, and recently arrived safely in Harbin. He received a warm welcome and condolences from the democratic government and people from all walks of life along the way. At 6 p.m. on the 20th, Lin Feng, Chairman of the Northeast Political Council, and Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman, specially held a grand welcome banquet at the Songhua River Water Club in Harbin. Nearly 200 representatives from the cultural circles of Harbin, various organizations, and representatives of the Northeast education circles attending the meeting in Harbin were invited to accompany them. In his welcome speech, Chairman Lin Feng expressed a warm welcome to Zhang's righteous action of resolutely leaving Changchun to come to the liberated area to participate in construction work. He continued: People from all walks of life with a sense of justice in the Kuomintang-ruled areas have gradually come to the liberated areas one after another. We warmly welcome such righteous actions. Now, the task at the front of the liberated area is to win battles, and the rear is for production and construction. The Northeast Liberated Area urgently needs various specialized talents and to train a large number of production and construction cadres. We sincerely hope that various experts and scholars will come and work with us to build a new Northeast and a new China. Zhang then rose to speak amidst applause. He described the Kuomintang reactionary group's destruction of education and the people of Changchun's eagerness for the Liberation Army, saying, "They (referring to the Kuomintang reactionary group) are afraid that you will not degenerate and are most afraid of you getting close to the masses. Compared with the liberated areas, one side is truly hell and the other is heaven." Then he said loudly and enthusiastically: "We must widely publicize the fact that the liberated areas warmly welcome academic talents and intellectuals to the Kuomintang-ruled areas, so that a large number of people with a sense of justice there will come to the liberated areas to participate in construction work."
    Shortly after arriving in Harbin, Zhang participated in the education conference convened by the Northeast Political Council, attended every day, and actively spoke. Zhang told reporters: "From this meeting, I can see the spirit of the comrades in the liberated areas who are working hard and diligently studying and improving. This is in sharp contrast to the perfunctory and negligent manner of the Kuomintang at education conferences." He said excitedly: "Now I can also express my opinions and say what I want to say! But when I was the acting president of Changda, I couldn't say anything!" He told reporters that on April 7, the Kuomintang army, police, secret agents, and military police in Changchun dispatched together to surround Changchun University, arresting more than 80 students, faculty, and staff. Although he was the president, he could not avoid being inspected, and even his personal letters were opened and inspected. He smiled and said, "Now I often go to the Songhua River to swim and escape the heat, which is truly free!" Zhang is from Huang County, Shandong Province, and graduated from Beiping Prison Affairs College. In 1931, he studied at the University of Berlin in Germany and received a doctorate in mathematics. During his studies, he participated in the Anti-Imperialist League and the Anti-Japanese Allied Association. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, he returned to China and served as a professor at Xi'an Lin University, Northwest Associated University, and Northwest Normal College, as well as the head of the Department of Mathematics. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the Dean of Academic Affairs and Dean of the College of Science at Changchun University. In June last year, he became the acting president of the university. He is the author of books such as "Introduction to Higher Mathematics."

　　参加解放区建设工作
  　长春大学校长张德馨抵哈
  　林枫主席在欢迎宴会上致词
  　热诚欢迎各种专家学者共同建设新东北新中国
    【新华社东北三十日电】国民党长春大学代理校长张德馨因不堪国民党反动统治，决心献身解放区的民主教育事业，于六月三日与该校职员吴子义冒险穿越国民党军防线，逃出暗无天日的长春来解放区，于日前安抵哈市。沿途备受民主政府及各界人士之热烈欢迎与慰问。二十日下午六时，东北政委会林枫主席与高崇民副主席特假哈市松花江水上俱乐部举行盛大欢迎宴会，哈市文化界、各机关团体代表及在哈开会之东北教育界代表近二百人奉邀作陪。林枫主席在欢迎辞中对于张氏毅然离开长春来解放区参加建设工作的正义行动，表示热烈的欢迎。继说：国民党统治区具有正义感的各界人士，现在已逐渐先后来解放区，我们对于这样的正义举动，十分欢迎。现在解放区前方的任务是打胜仗，后方就是生产建设，东北解放区亟需各种专门人材，并培养大批生产建设干部，我们热诚希望各种专家学者来和我们共同建设新的东北，新的中国。张氏继于掌声中起立讲话。他叙述了国民党反动集团摧残教育的情形及长春人民切盼解放军的心情，他说：“他们（指国民党反动集团）唯恐你不堕落，最怕你接近群众。同解放区比，真是一面是地狱，一面是天堂。”接着他高声热情的说：“我们一定要把解放区如此热忱欢迎学术人材和知识分子的事实，广泛的宣传到国民党统治区去，使那里大批有正义感的人，都到解放区来参加建设工作。”
    张氏抵哈后不久，即参加了东北政委会召开的教育会议，每日必到，并且积极发言。张氏告记者说：“从这个会议，看出了解放区教育同仁埋头苦干，努力钻研改进的作风。与国民党在教育会议上那种例行公事，因循苟且简直成一鲜明对比。”他兴奋的说：“我现在也能够发表意见，说我要说的话了！但是当我做长大代理校长时，却什么也不能说！”他告诉记者，四月七日长春的国民党军队、警察、特务、宪兵即曾一齐出动，将长春大学团团包围，捕去学生教职员八十多人，他虽身为校长，亦不免被检查，连平日来往私人信件也要被拆阅检查。他微笑说：“现在我经常到松花江去游泳避暑，真是自由自在！”张氏为山东黄县人，北平监务专门学校毕业，一九三一年留学德国柏林大学，获数学博士学位。留学期间曾参加反帝同盟和抗日同盟会。一九三七年抗战爆发后归国，历任西安临大、西北联合大学教授，及西北师范学院教授兼数学系主任。抗战胜利后任长春大学教务长兼理学院院长。去年六月任该校代理校长。曾著有“高等数学概论”等书。
