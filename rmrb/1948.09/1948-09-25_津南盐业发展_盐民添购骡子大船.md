[Ji Zhong Electric] Jinan County (newly established county, formerly Tianjin County, Hebei Province, previously under the Bohai Liberated Area, assigned to Ji Zhong this August) has a vast salt field, producing a large amount of salt, and the local people depend on salt production for a living. Before liberation, the salt farmers suffered under the rule and oppression of the Kuomintang government, local feudal forces, and bandits, leading to a very difficult life. Before the incident [likely referring to the Communist takeover], the Kuomintang government seized the salt flats, prohibiting the masses from opening the flats for salt production. Some salt farmers who secretly produced a little salt would have their salt flats destroyed and be arrested if discovered by patrols, requiring bribes to be released. Some who boiled small amounts of salt would have their pots smashed if found. After the incident, local feudal landlords and despots became the owners of the salt flats, and the local people had to pay salt rent to the landlords every year, and selling salt had to be done secretly, otherwise they would be kidnapped by bandits. The local puppet self-defense corps even extorted in every possible way, requiring tax money for salt carts coming and going, deterring many people from transporting salt. Salt sales were sluggish, prices plummeted, and the masses were subjected to layers of exploitation, making their lives extremely difficult.

When the People's Liberation Army reached Jinan, the salt farmers were liberated. The democratic government first called on the masses to open salt flats and produce salt in large quantities, explaining our Party's policies and taking responsibility for opening up sales channels for the salt farmers, announcing that if the salt produced could not be sold, the government would purchase it at market prices. Initially, the masses were concerned that the government would purchase the salt at low prices, but after repeated explanations from the government, the masses began to produce salt. Because they had been living in poverty for many years, they had no grain to eat and could not go to the salt flats, so the government provided grain loans to support them. In Qiu Zhuangzi, Da Su Zhuang, and other eight villages alone, 16,130 catties of grain were loaned. With the strong support of the government, the salt industry has greatly developed this year, the number of salt farmers has increased, and many new salt flats have been opened. For example, in Qiu Zhuangzi, the entire village had 60 salt farmers last year, producing 300,000 catties of salt. This year, the number of salt farmers has increased to 119, producing 1,000,000 catties of salt, and 49 new salt flats have been opened. Sun Sichang's family of five in this village, father and son, have been producing salt every year, but have been in debt every year, owing 40,000 catties of salt. After liberation, in just one year, he saved and repaid all his debts. This year, he produced another 50,000 catties of salt, which can be exchanged for 100 shi of corn (100 catties per shi), enough for the whole family to eat for five years. In the entire village of 280 households with 2,000 people, 260 households produce salt. This year, the most productive salt farmers (referring to the actual labor force producing salt) averaged more than 30,000 catties each, the average was 15,000 catties each, and the least was 10,000 catties. In total, the village produced 6,000,000 catties of salt. The entire village has now added 15 mules, 6 large carts, and 4 large boats, and is preparing to greatly expand salt transportation.

　　津南盐业发展
  　盐民添购骡子大船
    【冀中电】津南县（新划县，原为河北省天津县，前属渤海解放区，今年八月划归冀中）有一片广阔的盐场，产盐甚多，当地群众都依靠晒盐为生。该区在未解放前，盐民们受着国民党政府和当地封建势力以及土匪的统治欺压，生活很苦。事变前，国民党政府霸占盐滩，不许群众开滩晒盐，有的盐民偷着晒一点，被巡查出，先把盐滩毁坏，把人捕走，托人花钱才能出来。有的熬点小盐，查出还砸锅。事变后，当地封建地主和恶霸分子成了滩主，当地群众年年得给地主们拿盐租，卖盐时还得偷着，不然就会被土匪绑走。当地伪自卫团更百般勒索，拉盐的大车来往都要给税钱，闹的许多人不敢去拉盐。盐销路不畅，价钱跌落，且受层层剥削，群众生活极为困难。
    解放军打到了津南，盐民解放了。民主政府首先号召群众大量开滩晒盐，讲明我党政策，并负责给盐民打开销路，宣布如果晒的盐卖不了，政府以市价收买。起初群众有顾虑，怕晒出盐来政府以低价收买，经政府再三解释，群众这才开始晒。因历年生活困难，早已没粮食吃了，不能下滩，政府便贷粮扶植。仅邱庄子、大苏庄等八村，即贷粮一万六千一百三十斤。在政府大力扶植下，今年盐业大大发展，盐民增加，并大量开设新滩。如邱庄子去年全村盐民六十人，产盐三十万斤。今年盐民增至一百一十九人，产盐一百万斤。并开设了四十九副新滩。本村孙思常五口人，爷俩年年晒盐，年年欠债，已欠下四万斤盐的帐。解放后才一年的工夫，他省吃俭用把帐都还了。今年又晒了五万斤盐，能换一百石棒子（每石一百斤），够全家五年吃的。全村二百八十户，二千口人，晒盐的有二百六十户，今年产盐最多的每人（指实际晒盐的劳动力）平均三万多斤，平常的每人平均一万五千斤，最少的也晒一万斤。总共全村产盐六百万斤。现全村已添了十五头骡子，六辆大车，四只大船，还准备大量开展运盐。
