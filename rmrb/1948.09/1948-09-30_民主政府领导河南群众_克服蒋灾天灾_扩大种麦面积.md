[Ji Lu Yu Electric] The Henan region is currently experiencing four major disasters: First, the enemy disaster, with the Third District being the most severely affected. According to a survey of ten counties, since this spring, 11,933 livestock have been looted, 6,123 Zhuang Ding (farm laborers) have been captured and not returned, over 20,000 houses have been burned down, over 1,000 carts have been destroyed, over 14.9 million catties of civilian grain have been looted, and over 1,400 people have been killed. The Fifth District is the next most affected, but in Heze and Qibin counties alone, over 5,000 Zhuang Ding have been captured and not returned, and over 9,000 houses have been burned. In Qibin alone, over 2,000 livestock have been looted. Second, the flood disaster, with the Seventh District being the most severely affected, followed by the Third and Second Districts. Preliminary statistics show that in Kunshan alone, 250 villages were flooded, covering 2,000 hectares of land. In Jining, over 2,500 hectares of land were flooded. In Nanwang and Jiaxiang, over 1,000 hectares each were flooded, totaling 476 villages and 6,574 hectares of land. In the Third District, 1,710 villages were flooded, covering 9,850 hectares of land. The most severely affected area is Yutai, where all autumn crops in five districts were destroyed by floods, with 640 out of 850 villages in the county being flooded. The Third Administrative Office has allocated 20,000 catties of grain for relief. Six out of eight districts in Chengwu were flooded. In the Second District, over 230 villages were flooded, covering over 914 mu of land. Third, the drought disaster. The entire county experienced drought followed by flooding, resulting in a general reduction in autumn harvests. The drought disaster is most severe in the Fifth District, where 46,000 out of 130,000 people in Qibin County are affected by the disaster. In the most severely affected villages, such as Hanzhuang, the average yield of small autumn crops is 50 catties, and the average yield of large autumn crops is 60 catties. Fourth, the insect disaster, mostly black insects, originating from wasteland and spreading rapidly. In Kunshan, small autumn crops in four districts were mostly eaten by insects. Black insects also appeared in five districts of Juancheng and parts of Dongming. In Nanwang, there are many bean worms, affecting about 400 villages. In addition to the above-mentioned severe disasters, the amount of wasteland is also alarming. In Juancheng County alone, the area of old wasteland plus seedling wasteland has reached 800 hectares. In Yunbei, there are 200 hectares of wasteland. The Third District currently has 600 hectares of wasteland. The total wasteland in Henan is estimated at 2,500 hectares. Therefore, the primary task for government departments is to seize the opportunity to plant wheat and eliminate wasteland. The following specific measures were decided at the Commissioner's meeting: (1) Regardless of class, whoever cultivates the wasteland will be guaranteed the harvest. In severely affected areas, the government will provide wheat seeds on credit, and Party, government, military, and civilian organizations will organize manpower and livestock to help the masses eliminate wasteland and plant wheat. In the border areas, the land of fleeing landlords and rich peasants will be managed by the government on behalf of the owners, and the masses will be encouraged to cultivate it. If the masses are unable to cultivate large areas of wasteland, government agencies can cultivate it. (2) Dredge and drain accumulated water, and try to drain water wherever possible to expand the wheat planting area. For example, the accumulated water in Yunju is being dredged and drained jointly by the Second and Seventh Administrative Offices and the Administrative Office. The survey team of the Administrative Office is currently conducting surveys in Nanwang. The government will vigorously mediate conflicts among the masses. If the dredging causes disasters and damages the interests of some of the masses, the government will provide appropriate relief and compensation. At present, governments at all levels are leading the masses to overcome difficulties, expand the wheat planting area, and strive to overcome Chiang Kai-shek's disaster and natural disasters.

　　民主政府领导河南群众
  　克服蒋灾天灾
    扩大种麦面积
    【冀鲁豫电】我河南地区现有四种大灾：一种是敌灾，以三分区为最重，据十个县调查，从今春到现在被抢走之牲口即达一万一千九百三十三头，被抓未回的庄丁六千一百二十三人，共烧毁房子二万余间，大车一千余辆，被抢民粮一千四百九十万八千余斤，被杀群众一千四百余人。五分区次之，但只菏泽、齐滨两县，被抓未回壮丁即达五千余人，烧房九千余间。仅齐滨牲口被抢二千余头。第二是水灾，以七分区为最重，三、二分区次之。初步统计昆山全境二百五十村，被淹地两千顷，济宁被淹地两千五百余顷，南旺、嘉祥各淹一千顷，共淹村庄四百七十六个，淹地六千五百七十四顷。三分区被淹村庄一千七百一十个，淹地九千八百五十顷。全境以鱼台为最重，五个区的秋苗全被淹毁，全县八百五十村，被淹的六百四十个村。三专署已拨粮两万斤进行救济。城武八个区被淹六个。二分区被淹二百三十余村，淹地九百一十四亩多。第三是旱灾，全县先旱后淹，大秋普遍减收，旱灾以五分区为最重，齐滨全县十三万人口已有灾民四万六千人。最严重村如韩庄，小秋平均收五十斤，大秋平均六十斤。第四是虫灾，多数为黑虫，产生于荒地，蔓延甚速。昆山四个区小秋多被虫吃，鄄城五个区及东明一部地区亦有黑虫，南旺豆虫很多，约有四百村。除以上重灾外，荒地亦甚惊人，只鄄城一县，老荒加苗荒已达八百顷。郓北荒地二百顷。三分区现全境荒地六百顷，全河南总计荒地两千五百顷。所以政府部门首要抓紧的即种麦灭荒。日前在专员会议上议决了如下具体办法：（一）灭荒不分阶层，保证谁种谁收。灾情严重区，政府贷麦种，并在党政军民各机关，组织人畜力帮助群众灭荒种麦。边沿区逃亡地富的地，以政府名义代管，叫群众来种，大片荒地群众真正种不了的机关可种。（二）疏顺积水，把可能找到出路的水尽量疏出，扩大种麦面积。如郓钜积水正由二、七两专署及行办共同负责疏顺，行署测量队正在南旺测量。对于群众间的矛盾，政府大力调解，若因疏水成灾而损害部分群众时，政府予以适当的救济与补偿。现在各级政府正在领导群众克服困难，扩大种麦面积，为战胜蒋灾与天灾而努力。
