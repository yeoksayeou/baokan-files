【North Yue Electric Dispatch】On the morning of the 12th, a unit of our army in Western Hebei, while en route to Ganchi (northwest of Zhuoxian County) to strike against the enemy repairing the road in Liulihe and Zhoukoudian, encountered the 128th Regiment of the 43rd Division of the 94th Army of bandits. Upon encountering the enemy's vanguard company (8th Company), they acted bravely and decisively, taking swift action and preemptively launching a fierce attack on the enemy. Catching the enemy off guard, after only 37 minutes of intense fighting, they completely annihilated the enemy's vanguard 8th Company and routed the main force of the enemy's forward troops, killing and wounding over 130 enemy soldiers, including the company commander. Sixty-three enemy soldiers were captured, including a deputy battalion commander, instructor, deputy company commander, and platoon leader. The captured items included four light machine guns, two 60mm mortars, one submachine gun, twenty-five rifles, two pistols, thousands of rounds of ammunition, and a portion of other military supplies, which are currently being inventoried.

【Central Hebei Electric Dispatch】The militia and armed work teams of Xiongxian and Anci counties are continuously striking against grain-grabbing enemies and protecting the autumn harvest by force. On September 6th, the armed work team of a certain district in Xiongxian County, in coordination with the armed work team of a certain district in Xingu, suddenly raided the pseudo-large village stationed in Bayangzhuang to seize grain. After 25 minutes of fierce fighting, they captured two bandits, seized five rifles and 370 rounds of ammunition, and drove away the pseudo-large village head. On the same day, the armed work teams and militia of two districts, in coordination with the armed demolition team of Xiongxian County, attacked the pseudo-large village of Xizan, capturing two pseudo-bao chiefs and one pseudo-reserve team member alive, seizing one rifle and sixty rounds of ammunition. The remaining bandits fled in disarray. On September 8th, the armed work teams of several districts, in coordination with the demolition team, attacked the pseudo-large village stationed in the Mangmangkou village northeast of Baigou, north of Daying. Due to the brave actions of the armed work teams, the battle ended in a few minutes, completely resolving the pseudo-large village and capturing fifteen people alive, seizing three pistols and over a hundred rounds of ammunition. On September 5th, the Xiongxian demolition team captured a Dragon Bay bandit spy in Guanlima Village (west of Zangang), seizing a pistol. On the same day, the armed work team of a certain district captured a bandit reserve team member alive in Mijiawu Village (north of Zangang), seizing a rifle and 225 rounds of ammunition. Cadres and militia of a certain district in Anci County also harassed more than 500 bandits of the 25th Regiment of Anci, who had sneaked into the pier to seize the autumn harvest, on September 4th. Upon hearing gunfire, the bandits abandoned pancakes all over the street and fled in a panic.
