　　【Ji Zhong, 7th dispatch】In the training movement, the Third Company of a certain unit of the Ji Zhong Local Corps adopted a method of realistic simulation, learning by doing, and improving through practice in their demolition training, achieving significant results. Before the training, the Third Company received a batch of newly liberated soldiers. In order to ensure the training yielded tangible results and to dispel the liberated soldiers' doubts about demolition, after discussion, it was decided to adopt a realistic simulation approach, reviewing as they practiced, and fully promoting military democracy, encouraging everyone to offer ideas and solutions. When Companies One and Three were training, they utilized natural terrain and objects, treating the simulations as real. Company One used a wheat stack as the core fortification, a pile of earth in front of the stack as a bunker, a pit on the side as a hidden bunker, surrounded by a shallow ditch less than three feet deep. When Company Seven practiced, they even set up chevaux de frise. After each squad practiced, the entire company would collectively review. On the first day of Company One's practice, some comrades were not serious enough, lacked awareness of the enemy situation, and moved slowly. They were criticized at the review meeting. Liberated soldier Wang Yonglai was praised at the meeting for his quick movements and low profile. When Company Three first started, some new comrades showed fear. After repeated explanations by everyone, their doubts were dispelled. Some people felt it was troublesome and didn't put in the effort, so a group of people was sent to the fortifications to act as hypothetical enemies. This way, while defending and attacking, combining the situation of mine demolition, everyone would discuss and solve problems at any time. In Company Two, veteran soldiers would first demonstrate so that new soldiers could watch. If there was anything they didn't understand, they could ask questions and get answers immediately. Only after they understood would the new soldiers be asked to practice. Finally, veteran and new soldiers would work together, reviewing after each practice. Some even had new soldiers lead as squad leaders in the final stage, giving everyone the opportunity to practice. In the few days of training, the newly arrived soldiers made significant progress in terms of both understanding and technique. Liberated soldier Yu Baotai from the Third Squad said, "In the past, I didn't know what demolition or flying mines were. After these few days of learning, I not only know what they are, but I can also use them." Shen Zhiming from the Ninth Squad said, "I also know the structure and power of the mines now." Finally, at the demolition learning summary meeting of the entire regiment, an actual demolition drill was conducted, dispelling the doubts and fears of individual comrades.

　　某部三连演习爆破
  　以假比真边演边学
    【冀中七日电】冀中地方兵团某部三连于练兵运动中，对于爆破学习，采取了以假比真、边演边学、边演边改进的方法，收效不小。练兵前，三边接受了一批解放战士，为了使练兵收到切实的成绩和打破解放战士对爆破的怀疑心理，经过大家研究，决定采取以假比真的办法，边演边检讨，充分发扬军事民主，让大伙出主意想办法。该连一、三排学习时利用自然地形地物，以假当真，一排利用麦秸垛当核心工事，以垛前的一堆土当地堡，一边的一个坑当暗堡，周围并有深不满三尺的一道小沟。七排作的时候，还特别设置了拒马。一个班作一次后，全排就集体检讨一次。一排头一天作的时候，有的同志态度不严肃，没敌情观念，动作迟缓，检讨会上都受到了批评。解放战士王永来动作快，姿势低，会上及时的表扬了他。三排刚作的时候，有的新同志表现害怕，经过大伙反复讲解，才打消了怀疑，有些人感觉麻烦，不上劲，于是又派一班人到工事里当假设敌。这样一边防御，一边攻击，结合地雷爆破情况随时变，大家就随时讨论解决。二排是老战士先作个样子，让新战士看，不明白的随问随答，都明白了，才叫新战士作，最后新老战士结合在一起作，作一次检讨一次，还有的在最后让新战士当小组长带着作，让大家都有演习的机会。新来的战士在几天的练兵中，不论从认识上、技术上，进步都不小。三班解放战士余保太说：“过去我不知道什么是爆破、飞雷，经过这几天的学习，我不但知道了，而且也会用了。”九班的沈志明说：“我也知道雷的构造和它的威力了。”最后全团在总结爆破学习大会上，又作了实际爆破的演习，把个别同志怀疑恐惧的心理打消了。
