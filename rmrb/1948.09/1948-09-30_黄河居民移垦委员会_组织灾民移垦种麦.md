[Ji Lu Yu Electric News] The Huanghe River Residents Relocation Committee, since its establishment in mid-June, has been conducting surveys in the Weinan Slope wasteland area. It was originally planned to relocate 300 to 500 households of riverbed disaster victims this year, with loans of 2 million jin of grain. However, due to the urgency of time, the plan was revised to temporarily relocate 100 households. In early July, personnel were sent to Kunwu's 2nd, 4th, and 5th districts, which were the most severely affected by the disaster, to conduct door-to-door investigations and all preparations for relocation (such as livestock and farm tools). The relocation began on July 29th, and by August 6th, 62 households of relocated people had arrived successively. They were divided into two large teams, based on villages, with seven subgroups under each team. Currently, some groups, based on the principle of voluntary participation, have formed three small mutual-aid teams, with two or three livestock per team, and each team consisting of three to five people engaged in production. Weinan Slope currently belongs to the 3rd and 4th districts of Hua County. This place is a large waterlogged area, repeatedly silted up by the Yellow River, resulting in fertile land. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was seized by large landlords from Qing, Pu, and other counties. After the Japanese invaders occupied the area, they and local bandits disturbed it for years, making it impossible for tenant farmers to cultivate the land, and most of them fled. In the past ten years, it has become a sparsely populated wasteland, more than thirty li in length and width. The Relocation Committee decided that the first batch of disaster victims would reclaim land here. Most of the disaster victims who have been relocated this time are from tenant farmer backgrounds, and they are skilled at plowing, harrowing, sowing, and planting. Ruan Degong's team got up in the middle of the night to cut more than 60 mu of grass, and the stubble land has been plowed for the second time. Li Xincheng's team plowed more than 80 mu in a month. Cao Yongxian was a model stretcher-bearer at home, and he is also a hero who can endure hardship in land reclamation. The 63 relocated households have reclaimed more than 1,000 mu of wasteland in just one month, and have already planted 303 mu of rape. In addition to reserving more than 200 mu of spring land nearby for vegetable gardens and nurseries, the more than 900 mu of wheat land that has been plowed and harrowed is waiting to be sown. It is expected that the first batch of early wheat will be completely planted by the beginning of the ninth month of the lunar calendar. Their most pressing difficulty at present is the lack of houses. Every relocated person has already made up their mind to become a resident of the new village, and in the center of Weinan Slope, they have already marked out residential areas, harvesting grounds, fertilizer yards, vegetable gardens, nurseries, etc., all of which have been arranged according to everyone's plans. All around are the green rape edges and the fertile land that has been cultivated. This place is named the United New Village. When spring comes next year, the United New Village will have a new look.

　　黄河居民移垦委员会
  　组织灾民移垦种麦
    【冀鲁豫电】黄河居民移垦委员会，自六月中旬成立后，即到卫南坡荒区进行勘查。原定本年迁移河床灾民三百至五百户，贷粮二百万斤，后因时间迫促，改定暂移一百户。七月上旬，已派员到灾情最严重的昆吾二、四、五区进行挨村挨户的调查，及一切垦移的准备工作（如牲口农具等），七月二十九号开始迁移，至八月六号先后到达垦民六十二户，共分两个大队，以村为单位，下设七个小组，刻下有的组在自觉自愿的原则下形成三个小犋，两个或三个牲口为一犋，每犋三五人不等进行生产。卫南坡现属滑县三、四区，此地是一个大水泊，经过黄河数次淤垫，因此土地肥沃。抗战前被清、濮等县大地主抢占，自日寇侵入该地后，日寇和当地土匪连年扰乱，佃户无法耕种，大部逃走，近十年来便成了长宽三十余里的地广人稀的荒区。移委会决定灾民首批在这裹垦荒。这次移来灾民多是佃户出身，犁、耙、耩、种顶在行，阮得功组半夜起来割草六十多亩，茬地已犁完第二遍。李心诚组一月犁了八十多亩，曹永先在家是个抬担架的模范，开荒也是顶能吃苦的英雄。六十三户垦民，只一个月就开出一千多亩荒地，并已种好三百零三亩蔓菁。除在附近留菜园苗圃二百多亩春地外，已犁耙好的九百多亩麦地，只待下种。预计旧历九月上旬头耧早麦即可全部种上。他们目前最感困难的是没有一座房子，每个垦民的内心早已做了新村之民，而且在卫南坡的中心，已经标记下住宅区、收割场、肥料场、菜园、苗圃等，这都是按照大家的计划安排的。四周围全是青绿的蔓菁边和已耕耙起来的肥沃土地，此地命名为联合新村。到明年春暖花开的时候，联合新村当有一幅新景象。
