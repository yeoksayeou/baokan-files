  　Several Problems in the Production Merit Campaign
  　Clarify the Purpose of the Production Merit Campaign
    The purpose of the merit campaign is to clarify the concept of serving the people in the minds of the workers, to encourage and organize the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, to improve technology, to promote business, and to improve the quality and quantity of production a step further.
    At the beginning of the mobilization of the merit campaign, there were many confused ideas among the workers. Some said, "Anyway, they're just asking us to work more." "We earn a day's wage for a day's work, what's the point of earning merit?" Some argued, "We worked the same way without setting plans in the past, what's the use of setting plans?" Others excused themselves because of the different nature of their work and said they couldn't set plans. For example, the Construction Section stated: Auxiliary workers don't have specific fixed tasks, they just go wherever and whenever they are needed. Staff members of the General Affairs Section believed: "The work is messy and miscellaneous, there's no way to set specific plans."
    Based on these ideological situations, the factory leaders first mobilized among the cadres, gradually implemented it to the groups, and let the workers discuss and study it themselves. As a result, many confused ideas were resolved in the group discussions. For example, when the equipment installation workers in the Textile Section discussed it, they said, "Let's hurry up and install more machines, so that many workers will have work to do and food to eat." Finally, they discussed how to install them quickly, and then they set a plan.
  　Specifically Formulate Merit Plans
    In the textile factory, the nature of various jobs is different except for the Textile Section, but each section is closely related and needs to cooperate well. Therefore, formulating a production merit plan is also a matter of resolving the relationship between each other and improving the quality and quantity of products.
    How to start formulating a plan? Should we formulate individual plans first, or collective plans first? After discussion, it was decided to formulate collective plans first. First, the factory leadership studied the entire production task, researched ways to complete the task, and then each section discussed and determined its own plan, and then individuals formulated their own plans based on the plans of each section. The entire production merit plan revolves around the plan of the Textile Section. For example, the collective plan for the equipment installation part of the Textile Section is: 12,000 spindles should be installed by the end of June, and 8,000 spindles should be completed by the end of July. A total of 20,000 spindles should start initial operation by the end of July. Therefore, the collective plan of the Mechanical Section is to guarantee the supply of all parts, large and small, required for installation. The collective plan of the Construction Section is to guarantee the construction of the installation factory building. The collective plan of the General Affairs Section is to guarantee the full supply of all materials. In this way, the close cooperation between the departments was adjusted in the merit campaign, and merit was achieved in completing the tasks of each department.
    After the collective merit plan is clarified, individual production merit plans are formulated according to each person's specific situation to ensure the completion of the entire collective plan. There are mainly the following issues when formulating the plan: (1) There must be a focus: For example, the maintenance workers of the opening and cleaning section of the Textile Section focus on checking and adjusting the machines to make them run smoothly and save raw materials. Therefore, the main conditions of the individual production plan are: (a) Frequently check and adjust the machines. (b) Save raw materials, so that the oil consumption is reduced by nine pounds compared with before. When pouring oil, pour frequently and less often. Machines with fast rotation speeds need to be poured more than twice a day. (c) Take care of the machines, clean them regularly, and do a major cleaning once a week. (2) It must be tailored to each person's specific situation. Merit standards should be stipulated separately for technicians and ordinary workers. For example, ordinary workers mainly improve their skills, and take care of tools and raw materials in the process of learning skills. Therefore, technical progress and care for raw materials and tools should be rewarded. Technicians mainly increase production, promote production, teach technology to others, play a leading role, and improve technology, etc., all of which should be conditions for recording merit. (3) The conditions for earning merit should not be too high or too low. They should mainly be based on the machine production volume and the existing technical level of the workers, taking into account that everyone can earn merit (of course, not by lowering the conditions for earning merit). (4) Inspire and encourage workers' creativity, so that workers use their brains and hands to improve their skills and master technology.
  　Merit Campaign and Organization Leadership
    Organizational leadership is an important part of the merit campaign. It is not only important at the beginning of the merit campaign, but also must be well led and controlled during the campaign. The entire factory established a merit committee, composed of the factory director, the chairman of the trade union, etc. The main task is to guide and control the entire merit campaign, and to assess and approve the merit grades on time. Each section established a merit branch, composed of the section chief, the branch chairman of the trade union, etc. The main task is to supervise the completion of the merit plan as scheduled, report the merit grades to the merit committee on time, and put forward opinions on the evaluation and determination of the merit grades; directly lead the merit groups in each section and group. The merit group is based on the trade union and administrative group, and is not reorganized separately. After the merit is evaluated, it is immediately announced to the workers; encourage and commend those who have done well, and put forward future directions for those who have not done enough, and help them quickly correct their shortcomings.

### 安东纺织厂　生产立功运动的几个问题

  　生产立功运动的几个问题
  　明确生产立功运动目的
    立功运动是为了使职工在思想上明确为人民服务的观念，鼓励和组织职工的劳动积极性和创造性，提高技术，推进业务，把生产的质量和数量提高一步。
    在动员立功运动的开始，职工中有很多糊涂思想，有人说：“反正叫咱多干活。”“干一天总挣一天工资，立功干什么？”有的主张：“过去没订计划也是一样干，何用订计划？”也有的借口工作性质不同，不能订计划。如工事科提出：补助工没有具体固定任务，什么地方什么时候用着就去干。总务科职员认为：“工作零乱事务，没法订具体计划。”
    根据这些思想情况，工厂的领导者首先在干部中进行动员，逐步贯彻到小组并由工人自己来讨论和研究，因之，在小组讨论中，解决了很多糊涂思想。如纺织科按装工人讨论时说：“咱们赶快干，多按几架机，能使很多工人有活干，有饭吃。”最后又讨论怎样快按装，于是便订了计划。
  　具体订立功计划
    在纺织厂来说，除纺织科外，各种工作性质都有所不同，但各科都是密切地联系着，都需要很好地配合起来。因此，订生产立功计划，也是解决互相间关系，提高产品质与量的问题。
    怎样着手订计划？究竟先订个人计划，还是先订集体计划？经讨论后，决定先订集体计划。首先是厂的领导方面根据整个生产任务，研究出完成任务的办法后，各科再讨论、确定各科的计划，个人又根据各科计划，来订自己的计划。整个生产立功计划都围绕着纺织科的计划。如纺织科按装部分集体计划是：六月底要按装一万两千锭子，七月底完成按装八千锭子，总计至七月底两万锭子要开始初步运转。因此，机械科的集体计划便是保证供给按装上需要之一切大小零件。工事科集体计划就是保证按装厂房的建筑。总务科的集体计划就是保证一切材料的充分供给。这样在立功运动中，调整了各科密切配合的关系，在完成各科的任务上立功。
    集体立功计划明确了之后，即按照每人具体情况订立个人生产立功计划，保证整个集体计划的完成。订计划时，主要有下面几个问题：（一）要有重点：如纺织科清花股保全工，重点是检查调整机器，使之顺利生产，而又节省原料。因此个人生产计划，主要条件是：（甲）经常检查及调整机器。（乙）节省原料，使油料比以前节省九斤。在浇油时，勤浇少浇，回转数快的机器，每日需浇两次以上。（丙）爱护机器，定斯扫除，每星期大扫除一次。（二）要切合每个人的具体情况。技术工与普通工，都要分别规定立功标准。如普通工主要是提高技术，在学习技术过程中，爱护工具和原料。因此，技术进步和爱护原料工具，都应记功。技术工主要是增加生产，推动生产，把技术教给别人，起带头作用，改进技术等，这些都应为记功条件。（三）立功条件，不要过高或过低，主要还应根据机器生产量和工人的技术现有水平来订，照顾到人人都能立功（当然不是降低立功条件）。（四）启发和鼓励工人的创造，使工人用脑用手提高技术，熟练技术。
  　立功运动与组织领导
    组织领导，是立功运动中重要的一环，不仅在开展立功运动开始，就是在运动中，也要很好领导掌握。全厂成立立功委员会，以厂长工会会长等为委员组成。主要任务是指导与掌握整个立功运动，按时评定和批准立功等级。各科成立立功支会，以科长工会支会长等组成，主要任务是督促如期完成立功计划，按时将立功等级报告立功委员会，并提出评订立功等级的意见；直接领导各科股立功小组。立功小组，以工会和行政小组为基础，不另编组。评功后，立刻向工人宣布；进行鼓励表扬，作得不够的，要提出今后方向，帮助迅速改正缺点。　　　（新华社东北电）
