　　Yuci Masses Assist Government
  　Investigating Yan Clique Personnel and Weapons
    [Jinzhong Electric Dispatch] After the masses in Yuci, Jinzhong, were liberated, they enthusiastically assisted the democratic government in investigating Yan Clique personnel who had not registered with the government and the weapons and ammunition they had retained. It has now been found that there are forty-six Yan army officers, more than two hundred soldiers, two hundred and eighty-one light and heavy machine guns, one thousand nine hundred and forty rifles, more than twenty thousand artillery shells, ten thousand "shi" (石, a unit of dry volume, here likely meaning piculs) of grain, and one hundred and seventy telephones.
