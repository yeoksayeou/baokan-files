Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. To strengthen his increasingly unstable dictatorial rule and to enhance his control over state institutions and the people, the Tito clique substantially reorganized the Yugoslav cabinet on August 31. According to Agence France-Presse, the number of Deputy Prime Ministers has been increased from two to three after the reorganization. Police chief Rankovic has been promoted to Second Deputy Prime Minister, while remaining Minister of the Interior. Former First Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj remains in office and replaces Simic as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Four members of Tito's personal clique have joined the cabinet, one of whom is former Serbian Prime Minister Nicickovic, who has been appointed Third Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Federal Control Commission. According to a report by the Telegraph Agency, the Czechoslovak Communist Party's *Truth Daily*, in commenting on the latest reorganization of the Yugoslav cabinet, pointed out that the Tito clique has degenerated into a group of murderers. The "reorganization" clearly demonstrates the panic and instability felt within the Tito camp. Rankovic's rise to become the highest figure in Yugoslavia after Tito reflects the characteristic of this reorganization, and the fact that Kardelj, the main "theoretician" of the Tito clique, has taken charge of Yugoslavia's foreign policy is also highly significant.

    【新华社陕北七日电】铁托集团为加强其日益不稳的独裁统治，并加强其对国家机构与人民的控制起见，于八月三十一日大事改组南斯拉夫内阁。据法新社消息称，改组以后，原副总理二人增至三人。警察首脑兰科维奇擢升第二副总理仍兼内政部长，前第一副总理卡德尔连任并代西米区而任外交部长。铁托私人集团有四人入阁，其中之一系前塞尔维亚总理尼契柯维区已出任第三副总理，并兼联邦管制委员会主席。据电通社报导，捷共真理报在评论此次南阁改组时指出：铁托集团已蜕化为谋杀者集团。“改组”明显地证明了铁托阵营中所感到的惊恐与不稳。兰科维奇之成为仅次于铁托的南斯拉夫最高人物，表现了这次改组的特点，而铁托集团主要“理论家”卡德尔之出掌南斯拉夫外政交策，也是意味深长的事。
