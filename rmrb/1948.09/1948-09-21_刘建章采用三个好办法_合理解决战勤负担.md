　　Liu Jianzhang, Director of the Yan'an Sub-district Cooperative of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, in Liulin District, Yan'an County, adopted methods such as wartime service contracting, mutual aid transportation, and the establishment of wartime service transfer stations to improve the past wartime service mobilization methods, taking into account the difficulties faced by farmers in the district regarding labor and livestock, and better completing the wartime service tasks. Farmers, with their wartime service burdens more reasonably resolved, have been relieved of concerns about feeding livestock for service, and are gradually increasing the number of livestock they raise.

　　Due to the brutal destruction during the occupation by bandits, the number of livestock in the district decreased sharply by 74% compared to before the war. Due to a severe shortage of grain, most farmers went south to areas like Luochuan to trade grain to maintain their livelihoods, but due to a lack of organization and capital, they not only delayed agricultural production but also transported little grain. In the past, the district's wartime service mobilization methods involved concentrated mobilization, which wasted a lot of work time, and each donkey carried little weight. Moreover, the civilian laborers had to pay for their own fodder and food on the return journey. In order to solve the above difficulties and contradictions, Liu Jianzhang, in coordination with the district government, adopted the following three methods:

　　(1) Organize long-distance contracting: The supply station converts the rice, grass, and fodder supplied to the civilian laborers into cash, which is handed over to the cooperative to organize long-distance transportation for wartime service tasks. Because the price of grain is low in the south, the cooperative organizes civilian laborers to bring back grain on the way. The results showed that the labor and livestock used were reduced, but the amount transported actually increased. For example, in the past, 500 donkeys could only carry 45,000 catties, but the first time six teams were organized for contracting, 349 donkeys carried more than 51,000 catties and completed the task ahead of schedule. As a result, the cost of supplies from the supply station was reduced by 45%. The porters moved quickly and orderly, saving 1,500 man-days and animal-days compared to the previous mobilization method due to assembly. The porters earned more than 77 shi of grain by selling the grain they brought back on their return journey, which was distributed among the porters according to their labor. In addition to using six mules from the Yan'an County Cooperative as a base, the remaining porters were farmers in the district with livestock who volunteered to participate, and their crops were cultivated through mutual labor exchange with others in the villages, with the profits from grain trading shared with them. This method combines wartime service, grain trading for relief, and agricultural production, and is deeply welcomed by the masses. To facilitate transportation, the Industrial Cooperative has invested 10 million yuan as a grain trading fund for the contracting team, and the cooperative has also sent people to the transportation locations in advance to prepare the purchase of grain, making it easier for the porters to transport it upon arrival.

　　(2) Mutual aid for sideline transportation: This method combines wartime service transportation with sideline transportation and agricultural cultivation through labor exchange. This method is more flexible than long-distance transportation. In the past, spontaneous trading by the masses was characterized by a shortage of capital and meager profits. This situation was completely reversed after Liulin Village and Wangjiagou adopted this method. For example, Ai Keqin, He Zhanyuan, and Ma Haixiu from Liulin Village jointly bought donkeys to transport wartime service supplies and trade grain. One person took turns farming in the village, and they transported six times in two months, earning a net profit of 1.83 million agricultural currency and 1.3 dou of wheat. Recently, they bought two more livestock for transportation, and the crops were cultivated as usual. In Wangjiagou, 13 out of 48 households participated in transportation, making a significant profit. Those in the village who lacked capital for trading received assistance from the cooperative and private individuals. The cooperative provided 34% of the grain trading capital. After several grain transportations and contracting jobs, not only was the food shortage solved, but all the autumn fields were cultivated as usual.

　　(3) Wartime service transportation station: The masses raised funds and the government provided loans to help purchase livestock, and established stations specifically for the transfer of routine, small-scale wartime service tasks. This changed the past problem of transferring goods along villages, with each village changing people and donkeys, which wasted a lot of time and affected agricultural production. In mid-June, the district set up three stations with ten livestock at key transportation routes in the district, and all routine wartime service tasks were handled by these three stations. When there were tasks, they were transferred according to the station. When there were no tasks, they were used for milling flour and transporting coal for production. If there were many wartime service tasks, the masses were temporarily mobilized for transfer, and then the stations would repay the labor. If the expenses exceeded production, the cost was borne by the people of the entire district. The results of the implementation were well-received by the masses.

　　By June, the district had formed a long-distance donkey team of 111 donkeys, a short-distance cattle team of 50 cattle, 70 temporarily mutually-aided livestock, and three wartime service transportation stations. The number of livestock in each village increased daily, with more than 30 heads added in the entire district in two months.

### 刘建章采用三个好办法　合理解决战勤负担

　　刘建章采用三个好办法
  　合理解决战勤负担
    【新华社西北十八日电】陕甘宁边区延属分区联社主任刘建章，在延安县柳林区，采用战勤包运，朋帮运输和建立战勤转运站等办法，改善过去战勤动员方式，照顾了该区农民劳畜力困难和生产，并更好的完成了战勤任务。农民以战勤负担得到较合理解决，解除了怕喂牲口支差的顾虑，日渐增喂牲口。
    该区由于胡匪侵占期间的残酷破坏，畜力较战前锐减百分之七十四。由于粮食非常缺乏，多数农民南至洛川一带贩粮维持生活，但因缺乏组织和本钱，既耽误农业生产，又驮运不多；而该区过去战勤动员方式，动员集中既误工很多，每驴驮的重量也不大，民工在返回途中，尚须自贴草料、吃用等费。为解决以上困难和矛盾，刘建章乃协同区政府采用了以下三个办法：
    （一）组织长脚包运：即由兵站将供给民工之米、草、料等折成现金，交给合作社组织长脚包运战勤任务；因南钱粮价低，由合作社组织民工附带贩回粮食。实行结果，所用人力、畜力减少，驮量反而增加。如过去五百头驴只能驮四万五千斤，而第一次组织六个小队包运结果，三百四十九头驴，就驮了五万一千多斤，并提早完成了任务。因而兵站供给的费用减少了百分之四十五。脚户动作迅速整齐，又比过去实行动员时，节省了因集合等而浪费的一千五百个人工和畜工。脚户回程中贩回粮食出卖，共赚粮七十七石多，由脚户按劳力分配。包运队除以延安县联社六个骡子作基础外，其余脚户由该区有牲口的农民自愿报名参加，其庄稼则在农村中自找对象变工耕种，而以贩粮所赚与之分红。这一办法使战勤、贩粮渡荒和农业生产三者结合起来，深受群众欢迎。为便利运输，现工合特投资一千万元作包运队贩粮基金，合作社亦已派人至运输地点事先筹买好粮食，便于脚户随到随运。
    （二）朋帮副业运输：即战勤运输与副业运输、农业耕种变工结合进行。此办法比长脚运输更具机动性。过去群众自发贩运，因资本短少，利润轻微。柳林村和王家沟采用此法后即完全相反。如柳林村艾克勤、何占元和马海秀三人合伙买驴运输战勤及贩粮食，一人轮流在村种地，两月中共贩运六次，净赚农币一百八十三万元及麦子一石三斗，最近又增买两头牲口运输，庄稼则照常耕种。王家沟全村四十八户，即有十三户参加运输，获利很大。该村贩运缺乏资本者，由合作社和私人间借助。贩粮资本有百分之三十四为合作社所借。经几次运粮、包脚，不但吃粮得到解决，并使全部秋田照常耕种。
    （三）战勤运输站：即由群众集资及政府贷款帮助购买牲口，设站专门转运日常零星战勤。改变了过去沿村转送，村村换人换驴，化费时间很多，影响农业生产的毛病。六月中旬该区以十头牲口在该区交通要道分设了三个站，一切零星战勤统由该三站负责转送。有差时即按站转送，无差时即磨面驮炭生产。如战勤繁多时，临时动员群众转运，随后由各该站还工。如开支超出生产，由全区人民负担。实行结果，群众反映很好。
    至六月份该区已组成长脚驴一百十一头，短脚牛五十头，临时朋帮牲口七十头，战勤运输站三处。各村牲口日见增加，全区两个月间增加了三十余头。
