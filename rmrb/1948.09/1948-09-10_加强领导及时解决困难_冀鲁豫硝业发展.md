(Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch) The nitrate industry in areas such as Guancheng, Puyang, Nanle, and Yanggu is rapidly developing under the strong support of the democratic government. In Guancheng, there are more than 300 nitrate producing households in the city. From March 10th to June 19th, the Guancheng Nitrate and Sulfur Bureau provided loans of 500,000 yuan to support nitrate producers in developing production; it collected 21,000 jin of nitrate, valued at 1,200 yuan per jin, totaling 25.52 million yuan. In Puyang city, 118 people were boiling nitrate in November of last year, producing 3,560 jin per month. In March of this year, in order to strengthen leadership, the government established a city-wide nitrate boiling organization – the Nitrate Producers Committee – to promptly resolve difficulties for nitrate producers. It was determined that a portion of the nitrate price could be prepaid before collection to solve their funding difficulties, which greatly increased the enthusiasm of nitrate producers; nitrate boiling quickly developed. In April, the number of nitrate boiling households increased to 344 households, 440 people; production increased to 8,822 jin, of which first-class nitrate accounted for 95 percent and second-class nitrate accounted for 5 percent. In May, the number of nitrate boilers increased to 1,040 people, with a production of 17,568 jin, all of which was first-class nitrate in terms of quality. In order to develop nitrate and sulfur production, the Yanggu democratic government specifically established a Nitrate and Sulfur Bureau. This year, the bank branch provided loans of 275,000 yuan, and the Huafeng Store lent 2.35 million yuan to nitrate producers. As a result of the development of the nitrate industry, the number of nitrate producers increased from 136 households to 225 households. In the first half of this year, 56,766 jin of nitrate were produced. This spring, Nanle city produced 19,550 jin of boiled nitrate. To avoid nitrate producers suffering losses due to grain price fluctuations, it was decided that the nitrate price would be based on the grain price when the public collected nitrate. It has now increased from 900 yuan per jin to 1,300 yuan, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of nitrate producers.

  　冀鲁豫硝业发展
    【冀鲁豫电】观城、濮阳、南乐、阳谷等地硝业，在民主政府大力扶植下迅速发展。观城城关共有硝户三百多户，从三月十日到六月十九日一百天中，观城硝磺局曾贷款五十万元扶植硝民发展生产；收硝两万一千斤，每斤按一千二百元计算，共值二千五百二十万元。濮阳城关去年十一月份共有一百一十八人熬硝，每月生产三千五百六十斤。今年三月政府为加强领导，成立了全城的熬硝组织——硝民委员会，及时解决硝民困难，确定收硝前可预支一部硝价，解决他们的资金困难，硝民生产情绪更加提高；熬硝迅速发展起来。四月份熬硝户增至三百四十四户，四百四十人；产量增至八千八百二十二斤，其中头等硝占百分之九十五，二等硝占百分之五。五月份熬硝者增至一千零四十人，产量达一万七千五百六十八斤，在质量上均变为头等硝。阳谷民主政府为了发展硝磺生产，专门设立了硝磺局，今年银行支行曾贷款二十七万五千元，华丰商店借给硝民二百三十五万元。硝业发展，硝民由一百三十六户增到二百廿五户。今年上半年产硝五万六千七百六十六斤。南乐城区今春熬硝一万九千五百五十斤。为避免粮价变动时硝民吃亏，公家收硝时决定硝价按粮价定，现已由九百元一斤，增至一千三百元，硝民生产情绪极高。
