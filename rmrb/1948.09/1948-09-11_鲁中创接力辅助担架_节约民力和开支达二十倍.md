Xinhua News Agency, East China, August 8th: When the People's Liberation Army was operating on the Xu-Ji section of the Tianjin-Pukou Front, the transfer station under the Lu Zhong Support-the-Front Headquarters adopted a temporary auxiliary stretcher method of relaying and transporting the wounded, using work as a form of relief. According to preliminary results of experiments in old liberated areas and semi-old areas (including newly recovered semi-old areas), if organized well, this method can save manpower and expenses by twenty times compared to the previous method of using only permanent stretchers to transport the wounded directly from the forward dressing station to the rear hospital.

The auxiliary stretcher system transforms the previously military-affiliated wounded transfer stations into local ones, under the leadership of the Support-the-Front Headquarters. Its organizational form involves setting up a sub-station every thirty or thirty-five miles along the transfer line, coordinating with the village government to organize the masses locally to prepare stretchers, and allocating them according to the number of wounded. This type of stretcher is specifically used for transferring the wounded. During combat, the stretcher-bearers of the company rescue the wounded from the front line and hand them over to the permanent military stretcher team, which transports the wounded to the forward dressing station. Then, the auxiliary stretchers relay them station by station to the rear hospital.

The advantage of the auxiliary stretcher is that it allows permanent stretchers to focus on transporting from the battlefield to the dressing station, saving a large amount of manpower. For example, during the six or seven months of operations on the Tianjin-Pukou Line, the transfer station used auxiliary stretchers, with five people per set, giving out a total of fifteen catties of work grain per day. If permanent stretchers were used entirely, with each person serving for two months, the manpower and grain would exceed about twenty times (not including firewood). Auxiliary stretchers are allocated as needed, thus overcoming the waste of the past, where some permanent stretchers were idle for two or three months. On the other hand, this type of stretcher does not detach from production. For example, if they depart after supper, travel sixty or seventy miles to the next station and back, they can return before midnight, and can still continue production the next day, and also get grain, so it is willingly accepted by the masses. For example, the masses in the Loude District of Taining (a newly established county, part of Tai'an and Ningyang) voluntarily provided 1,200 stretchers even during the wheat harvest.

Regarding the organization and mobilization of auxiliary stretchers, the transfer station has gained the following preliminary experience in the trial implementation: First, the transfer station should establish close ties with the local government (mainly the district government) and maintain contact with the county. For example, the Taining County Party Committee assigned the task of organizing auxiliary stretchers at the district party secretary meeting, with the district party secretary or district head serving as the chief station master, responsible for mobilization, education, and other political responsibilities. The cadres of the transfer station are mainly responsible for liaison, handover, accounting, and other specific tasks, but they must also personally engage in mass work and cooperate with the government to conduct current affairs and support-the-front education for village cadres and the masses in order to lay a good foundation. In this way, when it is necessary to open up a new transfer line, the original transfer station can be entrusted to the local authorities. In old or semi-old areas, the organization of this type of auxiliary stretcher can be based on the original village organization. At the same time, when the wounded arrive at the station, while they are changing dressings and eating (handled by the attached medical personnel), someone must be sent to notify the next station of the number of wounded in advance, so that the next station can prepare stretchers in time, so as to avoid delays due to lack of prior preparation.

　　鲁中创接力辅助担架
  　节约民力和开支达二十倍
    【新华社华东八日电】解放军在津浦前线徐济段作战时，鲁中支前司令部所属之转运总站，采取以工代赈的按站接力运送伤员的临时辅助担架。据在老区、半老区（包括刚收复的半老区）试验初步结果，如组织得好，可较以往全部使用常备担架从前方包扎所直达后方医院这种方法节省民力和开支达二十倍。
    辅助担架系将过去属于军队系统的伤员转运站变为地方性的，由支前司令部领导。其组织形式是在转运线上每隔三十里或三十五里设立分站，协同村政府就地组织群众准备担架，看伤员多少随时支拨。此种担架专用于转运伤员。战斗中，连队的担架兵把伤员枪救出火线后，交给常备随军担架团，由担架团将伤员运至前方包扎所，再由辅助担架按站转运至后方医院。
    辅助担架的优点在于：可使常备担架专门负责由战地至包扎所的担运而节约大批民力。例如在津浦线作战六、七两月中，转运总站使用辅助担架，每付五人，每天共支给工粮十五斤。如果完全使用常备担架，以每人服务两个月计，则民力、粮食均超过约二十倍（柴草尚不在内）。辅助担架乃按需要随时支拨，因此克服了过去有的常备担架两三个月中没事做的浪费现象。另一方面，这种担架不脱离生产。如吃过下午饭出发，至下一站往返六、七十里，半夜前即可返回，第二天仍可照旧生产，又能得粮食，因此为群众所乐意接受。如泰宁（新设县，泰安、宁阳各一部）楼德区群众正当麦收时，仍自愿出担架一千二百付。
    关于辅助担架的组织与动员，转运总站在试行中得出以下初步经验：首先转运站应与地方政府（主要是区政府）取得密切结合，与县取得联络。如泰宁县委把辅助担架的组织任务在分区书记会议上布置，由分区书记或区长任正站长，负责动员教育等政治责任；转运站干部主要负责联络、交替、算帐等具体业务，但也必须亲自下手去作群众工作，配合政权对村干、群众进行时事和支前教育，以求打下良好基础。这样，在需要开辟新转运线时，即可将原有的转运站委托给地方负责。在老区或半老区，此种辅助担架之组织可以原有村组织为基础。同时在伤员到达站时，趁换药吃饭之际（由附设之医务人员负责），必须派人先往下一站通知伤员人数，使下一站能及时准备担架，以免事先无准备而拖延时间。
