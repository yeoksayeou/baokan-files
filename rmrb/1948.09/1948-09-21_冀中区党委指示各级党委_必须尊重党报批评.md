　　Jizhong District Party Committee Directs All Levels of Party Committees
  　Must Respect Criticism from Party Newspapers
    [Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently instructed all levels of Party committees to fully utilize newspapers to strengthen criticism and self-criticism. It first pointed out: Party newspapers are an important weapon for implementing the Party's policies, guiding work, and strengthening the Party's ties with the masses. Party committees and cadres at all levels must respect the criticism from newspapers and accept democratic supervision. Only in this way can they continuously improve themselves, improve their work, and strengthen the Party's ties with the masses. It then pointed out: Recently, the newspaper has published some criticisms of certain regions and departments, but those who were criticized generally adopted an attitude of ignoring them, lacking the spirit of review and self-criticism; a few even adopted an opposing, or even resistant, attitude, using distorted logic to cover up their mistakes instead of self-criticism, seemingly harboring a mentality of only allowing good news to be reported and not bad news. These are not the behaviors that a Party organization and its党员 cadres should have. In order to promote mass criticism and self-criticism, the following instructions are given: (1) Newspapers should truly become an important weapon for the people to express their opinions and supervise the bureaucracy of leading organs or certain Party members and cadres. For criticisms and suggestions in the newspaper that involve the local area or department, the local leading organ and the competent department, regardless of the source of the news and whether it is true or not, should conduct a serious inspection. After analysis and research, if the criticism is correct, supplementary materials should be provided to the Party newspaper, further self-criticism should be conducted, and the specific measures and results of correcting shortcomings and mistakes should be reported to the Party newspaper in a responsible and continuous manner; if the criticism is incorrect, the actual situation should be calmly explained. Any refusal to accept criticism or deliberate failure to respond to criticism is not allowed, otherwise, organizational criticism will be received; those who persist in their mistakes will be subject to Party disciplinary action. (2) In the future, newspapers should strengthen criticism and self-criticism. Party committees at all levels should mobilize Party members and cadres to seriously examine their work and conduct a factual and public disclosure of shortcomings and mistakes, so as to educate the whole Party and educate the masses. (3) In the future, manuscripts belonging to criticism, suggestions, and inquiries can be published without review by local leading organs. After receiving such manuscripts, the newspaper should handle them responsibly. If problems are found, they can be investigated or inquired about before publication. If the published manuscripts contain inaccuracies, the local leading organs or Party members and cadres can provide accurate materials for public defense. If the criticism is wrong, counter-criticism can be carried out. Those who deliberately distort the facts and make groundless accusations will also be subject to criticism and even punishment. However, this does not apply to those who are within the scope of understanding the issue. Criticisms on major issues should be published after being approved by the District Party Committee. If necessary, the consent of the local leading organ can be obtained before publication. If there is a major dispute over the issue, the District Party Committee can send people to conduct a thorough investigation to clarify the truth.

　　冀中区党委指示各级党委
  　必须尊重党报批评
    【冀中电】中共冀中区党委顷指示各级党委，充分利用报纸，加强批评与自我批评。首先指出：党报是贯彻党的政策，指导工作，加强党与群众联系的重要武器，各级党委与各部门干部，必须尊重报纸的批评，接受民主的监督。只有这样，才能不断提高自己，改进工作，密切党与群众的联系。接着指出：近来导报发表了一些对某些地区和部门的批评，但被批评者一般采取了置之不理的态度，缺乏检讨与自我批评的精神；个别的还采取了对立，甚至反抗的态度，用歪曲道理掩饰其错误来代替自我批评，似乎存有只准报喜不能报忧的精神。这都不是一个党的组织和党员干部应有的表现。为提倡群众性的批评与自我批评，指示提出：（一）报纸应真正成为人民大众发表意见，监督领导机关或某些党员干部的官僚主义的重要武器。对报纸上的批评建议，涉及本地或本部门的问题，当地领导机关及主管部门，不管消息来源，不管真实与否，应进行认真的检查，经过分析研究，批评对的，应向党报补充材料，做进一步的检讨，并将改正缺点错误的具体办法与结果向党报做负责的连续报导；批评的不对的，应冷静的说明确实情况。任何拒绝批评或对批评故意不答复，都是不允许的，否则要受组织批评；坚持错误的要受党的纪律处分。（二）今后报纸上要加强批评与自我批评，各级党委应发动党员干部，认真检查工作，对缺点错误进行实事求是的公开揭发，以便教育全党，教育群众。（三）今后属于批评建议及问事处之类稿件，可不经当地领导机关审查。报社接到此类稿件后，应作负责的处理。认为有问题时，可调查或询问后发表。已刊登之稿件，如有不真实处，当地领导机关或党员干部可提出确切材料，公开申辩。批评错了的，可进行反批评。若有故意歪曲事实，无中生有的乱批评，亦要受到批评甚至处分。但属于对问题认识范围者不在此限。有关重大问题的批评，应经区党委批准后再发表。必要时可取得当地领导机关同意后再发表。对问题如有大的争论，区党委可派人切实调查，弄清真象。
