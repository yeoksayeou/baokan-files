　　Fishermen of Haibao in Huanghua
　　Huanghua County (i.e., Xin'hai County south of Tianjin, Hebei Province, originally under the Bohai District, assigned to the Jizhong District in August this year), the Haibao District, is a coastline over a hundred miles long. The entire district, except for one rural village, has twenty-three Haibao, with two thousand five hundred and ninety-eight fishing households. Before liberation, everything "within sight" and "within reach" belonged to the fort lords (similar to rural landlords). The fort lords traditionally held three major privileges: fort rights, sea rights, and land rights, turning fishermen into fishing serfs. Even if the fishermen built their own houses, the house ownership belonged to the fort lord, who could evict the fishermen from their houses at any time. The fort lords practiced cruel "stripping," monopolized the sale of seafood, and engaged in usury and unpaid labor, among other feudal exploitations. "Stripping" meant that whenever fishermen returned from fishing at sea, they had to hand over 15% of their catch to the fort lord without compensation, and the fort lord could pick the best. If they did not catch good seafood, they had to buy good seafood from others to give to the fort lord. Furthermore, fishermen were not allowed to sell their seafood freely; they had to sell it to the fort lord at a low price and endure exploitation through rigged scales. Fishermen were not allowed to buy fishing gear from outside; they could only buy it from the fort lord at a high price. Under this cruel exploitation, fishermen's lives became difficult after the fishing season. The fort lord would seize the opportunity to offer high-interest loans, converted into low-priced seafood, to be repaid the following year. This type of debt was called "shrimp debts." In addition, the fort lords forced fishermen to perform various types of unpaid labor and could arbitrarily rape fishermen's women. Women in the Fengjia Fort area dared not walk in front of the fort lord.
　　The fort lords also organized armed forces to suppress the fishermen's resistance. Fishermen described the fort lords' establishment of public halls and armed suppression of fishermen as "the golden palace of the Tongju family, the false court of Shimingxuan," and "connected to officials above (colluding with the old government) and connected to bandits below (colluding with bandits)."
　　After liberation, through long and complex struggles, the fishermen finally gained liberation.
　　The struggle was complex and tortuous. After the fishermen's struggle initially achieved victory, in 1946, the fort lords, led by Shi Mingxuan, organized armed special agents (Kuomintang returning legions, wearing tall hats) to carry out a restoration, reversing the achievements and shooting fishermen activists. Afterward, after a long struggle, the fishermen had their own armed forces—the Sea Defense Detachment, district teams, and village fishermen's joint defense teams—which crushed the reactionary fort lord forces and suppressed the fort lords who had committed heinous crimes. Last year, the struggle deepened further, but due to the implementation of policies without considering specific circumstances and mechanically applying the land reform model, "dividing boats and nets" was implemented, and class lines were drawn arbitrarily, failing to clearly distinguish the targets, which disrupted the class ranks. In the struggle, the interests of independent laborers and small property owners were attacked and damaged. Added to this were heavy fish taxes, some cadres issuing coercive orders, detaching themselves from the masses, and Kuomintang secret agents colluding with local feudal forces to spread rumors. Kuomintang armed forces constantly roamed the sea, robbing boats and kidnapping people. Therefore, the situation along this hundred-mile coastline was very chaotic, and many fishing boats fled elsewhere. Over a hundred fishing boats from Qikou Village alone fled to Donggu, affecting the fishermen's enthusiasm for production. After the Land Conference of the Bohai District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, it was decided that, in addition to eliminating the feudal occupation and exploitation of the fort lords, legitimate fishing at sea should be protected, and the policies of developing production, promoting economic prosperity, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital were explained thoroughly and correctly. At the same time, it was decided to cancel the past practice of drawing class lines and determining class composition, and three of the four types of fish tax were abolished. Furthermore, county and district cadres humbly reviewed their past coercive orders and errors in policy implementation with the masses. These measures dispelled the fishermen's concerns about being struggled against if they became rich and the heavy burden of fish taxes. The two hundred and forty households and over a thousand people who had fled returned home to produce. Now, the three major privileges unique to the fort lords of past generations—sea rights, fort rights, and land rights—have been eliminated. The fishermen have their own houses, and there is no longer the threat of eviction. The sea belongs to the country, and fishermen can produce freely without any restrictions. Feudal exploitation such as "stripping," monopolizing the sale of seafood, and usury has been abolished, and the fishermen are no longer subject to feudal exploitation.
　　On the basis of the fishermen's emancipation, the democratic government has strengthened sea defense and provided loans of 52 million yuan in North Sea currency and 20,000 jin of grain to support the development of the fishing industry. Fishermen are competing to purchase means of production. Statistics show that the entire district has purchased more than 1,500 new fishing nets of various kinds and built and repaired 27 fishing boats. Villages have also restored and established organizations centered on production; some villages have already established village administrative committees. The cadres of the original fishermen's trade union have also participated in administrative leadership. New and old cadres and experienced producers in each village have organized production committees to lead various freely formed partnership groups in production. Fishermen's enthusiasm for production is high, and harvests are abundant, which has improved their lives. The entire village of Fengjia Fort has laid a total of 1,050 nets, and from the first month to the end of May of this year, the total value of seafood collected amounted to over 1 billion yuan. The entire village of Zhao Jia Fort laid 1,600 nets, had four salt marshes, and produced 400,000 jin of salt in addition to a large amount of seafood. The total profit for the entire village was 240 million yuan. The 158 households, 784 people, each earned an average of over 300,000 yuan. The fishermen in the entire district have produced enough food for at least one year this year, and for some, enough for three years. Fishermen are actively purchasing fishing gear, livestock carts, weaving machines, and organizing cooperatives and agency stores.
　　In the past, maritime fishermen's lives had "three surges": winter was the "stagnant surge" (meaning they could not fish and had to sit at home and eat); spring was the "wild surge" (after eating up all the savings from fishing throughout the winter, they had to spend money to repair boats and nets); summer was the "sunny surge" (they caught fish, sold them for money, and had no worries about food, drink, clothing, and fuel). Now the fishermen say: "This year's 'three surges' only have the 'sunny surge' left!" Liu Chaofu of Yingtou, with his five brothers, caught more than 6,500 jin of fish and sold them for 7.86 million yuan, which can be exchanged for more than 39,000 jin of grain. The fishermen all say, "We have never had such a good year." Zhao Li of Zhao Fort said, "This year we have loans, more fish, and lower taxes, so it's all ours!" Zhao Qingzhang had food to eat after receiving a production loan, he said: "I will do whatever you ask me to do. I can't be separated from the Communist Party!" After receiving loans for production, many fishermen also broke with their ideas of relying on the heavens and gods. Li Dianwu's mother from Tang Fort said: "In the past, I believed in gods, burned incense and kowtowed, but for so many years, I didn't get anything! Now that the Communist Party has come, we have everything, this is the real god." After we abolished the feudal exploitation such as "stripping" by the fort lords at sea, the fishermen were freed from their chains and are living well. Ji Fengting of Langtuozi built three new rooms, and he said: "This is what I saved by not having the fort lord 'strip' my catch." The fishermen of Mapengkouzi, who sold forty-seven wives and daughters in the famine years, are now rich and are busy looking for wives. The Haibao, which was formerly ruled by feudal forces, has now become the fishermen's own Haibao!
　　Although the fishing industry here is doing very well this year, there is still a problem that needs to be solved urgently. Originally, one net boat was counted as ten and a half shares, the net owner counted as two and a half shares, the boat owner counted as two and a half shares; among the five people, the helmsman counted as one and a half shares, and the rest each counted as one share. The nets have to be repaired several times a year, which is borne by the net owner, and in reality, there is nothing left except for the repair money. The boat owners reflected: "It's okay in such a good year, but if the year is slightly worse, we will lose money, so no fishermen are willing to add nets."
　　Sea bandits are constantly harassing and sabotaging the fishermen's production. This year, Kuomintang bandits have harassed the area several times, shelling the fishermen in the area, robbing fishing boats, and constantly using planes to strafe the fishermen in the area. Our sea defense forces are actively operating on the coast and in the heart of the sea to protect fishermen's production, guarding against and attacking Kuomintang bandits, so that the fishermen dare to go to sea to fish. At present, the fishermen are asking to buy guns to defend themselves and protect their production.

　　黄骅海堡的渔民
    黄骅县（即河北省天津以南的新海县，原属渤海区，今年八月划归冀中区）海堡区，是一条长百余里的海滨。全区除一个农村外，有二十三个海堡，二千五百九十八户渔民。解放前，“眼望无边”“手指所及”（即眼力所及、手指所向）都属于堡主（类似农村地主），堡主传统地操有堡权、海权、地权等三大特权，把渔民变为渔奴。渔民自己盖了房子，房权却属堡主，堡主随时可以拔锅揭席把渔民赶出自己的房子。堡主对渔民实行残酷的“扒货”、垄断海货出售和进行高利贷、无代价劳动等封建剥削。所谓扒货，即凡渔民从海中捕鱼回来，须按百分之十五毫无代价地纳给堡主，并且由堡主任意挑选。如未捕得好货时，还须买别人的好货送给堡主。此外，渔民所得海货一律不准自由出售，必须低价卖给堡主，并得忍受过秤时之大秤剥削。渔民不准向外购买渔具，只能以高价向堡主购买。在这种残酷剥削下，渔季过后，渔民生活即陷困境。堡主便乘机放高利贷，折成低价海货，待明年讨还。这种债务叫作“虾空子”。另外堡主还强制渔民无代价地给作各种劳动，堡主可以任意强奸渔民妇女。冯家堡一带渔民妇女不敢在堡主面前走。
    堡主并组织有武装，镇压渔民的反抗。渔民拿“同聚家的金銮殿，时明轩的假朝廷”和“上通官（勾结旧官府），下通土（勾结土匪）”等话来描写当时堡主立公堂武装镇压渔民的残暴。
    解放后，经过长期的复杂曲折的斗争，渔民终于获得了翻身解放。
    斗争是复杂曲折的。当渔民斗争初步获得胜利后，一九四六年，堡主以时明轩为首组织了武装特务（还乡团、高帽队）实行复辟，倒回果实，枪杀渔民积极分子。之后，又经过长期斗争，渔民有了自己的武装——海防支队、区队以及各村渔民组织的联防队，摧垮了反动的堡主武装，镇压了罪大恶极的堡主。去年，斗争进一步深入，但又由于执行政策没有根据具体情况，机械搬运了土地改革的一套，实行“分船分网”，而且乱划阶级，没有很好分清对象，阶级阵营搞乱了；在斗争中打击与损害了独立劳动者和小资产者的利益，加上鱼税重和一些干部强迫命令，脱离群众，以及蒋匪特务结合当地封建势力乘机造谣；和蒋匪武装不断窜到海面上抢船捆人。因此在这一百多里的海岸线上，情况很是混乱，好多渔船都躲到外面去了。歧口一村即有百余只渔船逃亡东沽，影响了渔民的生产情绪。经过中共渤海区党委土地会议后，乃决定了除堡主的封建霸占剥削必须消灭外，海上正当渔业一律保护，并正确地深入地讲解了发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的政策。同时决定取消过去的划阶级定成份，四种鱼税取消了三种，另外县区干部虚心的向群众检讨了过去的强迫命令和执行政策的错误。经过这些工作打破了渔民怕过富了挨斗和鱼税太重的顾虑。躲出去的二百四十户、一千多人都回家生产来了。现在历代堡主所特有的海权、堡权、地权等三大特权铲除了，渔民有了自己的房子，再没有拔锅揭席的威胁。大海归国家所有，渔民可以自由生产，没一点限制。废除了“扒货”、垄断渔货出品、高利贷等封建剥削，渔民再不受封建剥削了。
    在渔民的翻身基础上，民主政府又加强了海防，还贷款北海币五千二百万元，两万斤粮食，扶持渔业发展。渔民均争购生产工具。统计全区共增买各种渔网一千五百余条，新造及修理渔船二十七只。村里也恢复和建立了以生产为中心的组织；有的村已成立了村行政委员会。原来渔民工会的干部也参加了行政领导。各村新老干部和生产有经验的人组织了生产委员会。领导各种自由结合成的插伙小组进行生产。渔民生产情绪高涨，收获甚丰，生活即随之改善。冯家堡全村共下网一千零五十条，自今年旧历正月到五月底共征海货折款达十亿余元。赵家堡全村下网一千六百条，有盐滩四付，除获大批海货外，又出盐四十万斤，总计全村共获利两亿四千万元，全村一五八户，七八四人，每人平均得卅万余元。全区渔民今年生产所得，至少够一年食用，多者够三年食用。现渔民均积极添购渔具及牲口大车、织布机等，组织合作社、代理店。
    过去海上渔民生活有“三涨”：冬季是“闷涨”（即是治不了鱼坐在家里干吃）。春季是“野涨”（一冬天把全年治鱼的积蓄吃光了，这功夫就得使钱收拾船、网）。夏季是“阳涨”（治了鱼卖下钱，吃、喝、穿、烧都不愁了）。如今渔民们说：“今年的‘三涨’，光剩下‘阳涨’了！”鹰头刘朝福，哥五个捕鱼六千五百多斤，卖了七百八十六万元，能换三万九千多斤粮食。渔民们都说：“没有过过这样的好年头。”赵堡赵立说：“今年贷粮贷款，鱼又多，税又轻，光剩咱的啦！”赵清章贷款后，生产有了饭吃，他说：“叫我干啥我干啥，我和共产党，算分不开啦！”经过贷款生产，好多渔民靠天赖神的思想也打破了。唐堡李殿武他娘说：“以先我顶信神，烧香磕头，这么些年，什么也没磕了来！如今共产党来了，什么也有了，这才是真神呢。”我们取消了海上堡主“扒货”等封建剥削后，渔民们解除了锁链，日子过的都很烘火。狼坨子姬风亭，新盖上三间房，他说：“这是没叫堡主‘扒货’省下来的。”马棚口子的渔民，闹荒年卖了四十七个老婆、闺女，今年过富了，都在张罗着讨老婆。从前为封建势力统治的海堡，现在已变成渔民自己的海堡了！
    虽说今年这里的渔业生产很好，但目前还有个问题应当急待解决。原来这里一个网船算十个半股，网主算两个半，船主算两个半；五个人当中，掌船的算一个半，剩下的每人算一个。鱼网每年要收拾几回，都由网主负担，实际上除了收拾钱，没有什么剩余了。船主们反映说：“象这样的好年头还凑合，年头稍赖点就赔本，这样渔民们谁也就不愿添网了。”
    海匪们是不断骚扰破坏渔民生产的。今年间蒋匪就骚扰该区数次，向该区渔民们打炮，抢渔船，并不时用飞机在该区扫射渔民。我海防部队为保护渔民生产，积极活跃于海岸和海心，警戒与打击蒋匪，使渔民们都大胆的下海治鱼了。目下渔民们都要求买枪自卫，保卫自个好好生产。
