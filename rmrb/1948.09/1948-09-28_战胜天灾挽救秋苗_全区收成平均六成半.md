　　Overcoming Natural Disasters to Save Autumn Crops
  　Average Harvest Across the Region Reaches Sixty-Five Percent
    [Our dispatch] This newspaper reports: Autumn harvesting is being accelerated in the vast areas of North China. According to preliminary estimates from various sources, the average harvest in the region this year is around sixty-five percent, which is better than the fifty percent harvest of the entire region last year. Spring rainfall was generally well-distributed, and the average wheat harvest across the region was around eighty percent. Better areas after the autumn harvest may reach over eighty percent, such as the first and second districts of Taiyue, the fifth and sixth districts of Beiyue, the Changzhi area of Taiyuan, and the areas east of Yuncheng and west of Weishan Lake in Jilu Yu, including Jiaxiang, Jinxiang, Yuncheng, and Juye counties. It is estimated that the average harvest in Taiyue, Beiyue, and Jizhong regions this year will be around seventy percent; while the average in Jinan, Jilu Yu, and Taihang regions will be around sixty percent. The average for the entire North China region will be around sixty-five percent.

    Floods, insect plagues, hailstorms, and partial droughts have impacted this year's autumn harvest in North China, leading to a poor harvest. Cadres at all levels in the North China region and the broad masses of people have made efforts to combat various disasters, reducing their impact on the autumn fields. However, due to various limitations, some losses were still incurred. This year, over eighty counties in the region suffered from floods, with over 11 million mu of autumn fields affected. Jizhong and Jinan were the most severely affected. In Jizhong, multiple breaches occurred in the Zulong River and upstream of the Hutuo River, flooding Gaocheng, Jinxian, Shenze, Anping, Raoyang, Gaoyang, Renqiu, Suning, and other counties. Among the more than 4.9 million mu of autumn fields affected in this area, approximately 2.5 million mu yielded no harvest at all. In Jinan, approximately 3 million mu of land in 22 counties along the Fuyang River and upstream of the Wei River, including Yongnian, Baixiang, Longyao, and Ningjin, were affected by floods. Parts of Pingshan and Xingtang in the Beiyue region, Anyang and Yexian along the Zhang River in the Taihang region, and Kunshan, Jining, and Hua County in Jilu Yu also suffered damage. Insect pests were found in over 150 counties across the region, with more than half of the counties experiencing severe infestations. In the second and fourth districts of Jinan, over one million mu of crops were eaten by armyworms and locust nymphs, resulting in an estimated reduction of 16 million jin of grain. In Jizhong, over 3,900 villages in the eighth, ninth, and eleventh districts suffered from insect pests, resulting in a 30 to 50 percent reduction in the autumn harvest. In the Taihang region, locusts damaged over 100,000 mu of autumn seedlings in more than ten counties including Linxian and Tangyin. In some areas, rainfall was delayed after the wheat harvest, and late autumn crops could not be sown in time. Some autumn seedlings suffered from drought after being sown, resulting in poor harvests in small areas of Jilu Yu, Jinan, Taihang, and Beiyue regions. Wind and hail disasters also caused damage in some areas, with 43 counties across the region suffering from hailstorms, affecting an area of approximately 1.8 million mu. In total, the area affected by various disasters was over 15 million mu, accounting for approximately one-tenth of the total cultivated area of 155.6 million mu in North China (excluding the Jinzhong district).

　　战胜天灾挽救秋苗
  　全区收成平均六成半
    【本报讯】总分社记者报导：华北广大区域正加紧秋收。据各方面初步估计：今年全区收成平均在六成半上下。较优于去年全区之五成年景。今春雨水一般比较调匀，全区麦收平均八成上下。秋后较好地区可达八成以上，如太岳之一、二分区，北岳之五、六分区，太原之长治一带，冀鲁豫之运东及微山湖以西之嘉祥、金乡、郓城、巨野等县。估计今年太岳、北岳、冀中各区平均在七成上下；冀南、冀鲁豫、太行各区平均在六成上下。全华北区平均在六成半上下。
    水灾、虫灾、雹灾及一部分旱灾，影响华北秋田今年歉收。华北区各级干部与广大人民，曾对各种灾害努力进行斗争，减少其对于秋田的影响。但受各种条件限制，仍造成部分损失。全区今年有八十余县遭水灾，被灾秋田达一千一百余万亩。其中以冀中、冀南最为严重。冀中潴龙河、滹沱河上游多处决口，冲淹藁城、晋县、深泽、安平、饶阳、高阳、任邱、肃宁等县。在该区被灾之四百九十多万亩秋田中约有二百五十多万亩全无收成。冀南滏阳河及卫河上游之永年、柏乡、隆尧、宁津等二十二县，受水灾面积约三百万亩。北岳区之平山、行唐，太行区漳河沿岸之安阳、邺县，冀鲁豫之昆山、济宁、滑县等处均有部分受灾。全区有一百五十余县发现害虫，半数以上县份较重。冀南二、四分区被黏虫蝗蝻吃光的庄稼有百万亩，估计减收一千六百万斤。冀中在八、九、十一等分区有三千九百余村遭虫害，被害秋田减收百分之三十至五十。太行林县、汤阴等十余县蝗虫吃坏秋苗十余万亩。某些地区麦收后落雨较迟，晚秋未能及时播种，有的已播种后秋苗受旱，在冀鲁豫、冀南、太行、北岳等地均有少部分地区歉收。风、雹等灾，亦在部分地区成害，全区遭雹灾地区县份达四十三县；受灾面约一百八十万亩。总计各种受灾面积为一千五百余万亩，约占华北全部耕地面积一万万五千六百余万亩中十分之一（不包括晋中分区）。
