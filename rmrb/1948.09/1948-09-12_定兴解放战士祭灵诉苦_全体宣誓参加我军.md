[Pingbao Frontline News] Two hundred and eighty soldiers of the Kuomintang army's New Second Army Provisional 21st Division, who were liberated in the Dingxing battle, recently held a memorial service in their garrison to vent their grievances. All vowed to join the People's Liberation Army to avenge their deceased relatives. During the memorial service, spirit tablets of twelve soldiers' parents, children, and siblings who were killed by Kuomintang bandits and local tyrants were arranged on the altar. Banners and wreaths sent by commanders and fighters of each company hung on both sides of the altar. Serial pictures illustrating Zhang Yuanguo's family's history of persecution by local tyrants were displayed, and white slogans were pasted around, creating an atmosphere of solemnity and tragedy. After the chief celebrant burned incense and made offerings before the spirits, more than thirty liberated soldiers rushed forward, vying to be the first to speak of their grievances. The atmosphere became tense. Comrade Fu Conghe was the first to speak, saying, "I am from Sichuan, and my family has five members. Since I was a child, my family has not had a house or a piece of land. My father carried sedan chairs for others, my elder brothers picked up horse manure every day, and my mother gathered chaff and leaves. The food we ate was not as good as the landlord's dog. Because the Red Army passed through our area, the Kuomintang bandits said that my elder brother and father had connections with the Red Army and killed them. Now that I have been liberated, I deeply feel that unless we overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, the poor will never be able to turn over. I want to take revenge and join the People's Liberation Army." Zhou Yuqing, from Henan, recounted, "In the past, my family rented land from Wei Zhidai, a landlord and head of the baojia system. One year, the harvest was bad, and we couldn't pay the rent. My father was beaten to death by Wei. My mother begged the villagers for a straw mat to bury my father. Later, my mother took me to beg for food, but the landlord refused to give us any, and my mother also starved to death." At the end of his account, he clenched his fists tightly, trembling all over, and gnashed his teeth, declaring, "I want to join the People's Liberation Army and avenge myself against those man-eating, blood-drinking landlords, tyrants, and Chiang Kai-shek." Zhang Chong recounted that because he couldn't pay the rent, he was driven to a temple by the landlord. The landlord was still not satisfied and wanted to forcibly take his younger sister, forcing her to hang herself. He was already sobbing uncontrollably as he spoke. The soldiers below were all crying. Li Qingzha recounted the tragic situation of his family eating chaff after his father died of illness, wiping away his tears and resolutely stating, "I am not sad, I want to resolutely join the army. I will go wherever the higher-ups tell me to go. After we finish fighting the enemies in North China, we will fight the enemies in South China." Finally, he called on everyone, saying, "Comrades! The day of revenge has arrived. We must take up our guns and fight Chiang Kai-shek to the end." On the spot, all the comrades were filled with grief and indignation, and actively signed up to join the army to avenge their deceased fathers. They also swore before the spirits that they would guarantee to serve the people to the end, would not desert, and would not return home until Chiang Kai-shek was completely defeated.

    【平保前线讯】定兴战斗中被解放的蒋军新二军暂二十一师战士二百八十名，最近在驻地举行祭灵诉苦大会，全体宣誓参加解放军，为死去的亲人报仇。祭灵时，灵桌上排着被蒋匪和地主恶霸杀害的十二位战士的父母子弟的灵牌，灵桌左右悬挂着各连指战员们送来的挽联、花圈，张元果家中被地主恶霸迫害的历史连环画，四周贴着白色标语，显得分外严肃悲壮。由主祭人代表在灵前焚香奠祭后，卅多名解放战士蜂拥向前，争着要求先诉苦，会场上顿时紧张起来，傅从河同志首先诉苦说道：“我是四川人，家有五口人，从小家就房无一间，地无一垄，父亲给人家抬轿，大哥二哥每天拾马粪，母亲讨糠采树叶，吃的饭还不如地主家的狗，因为红军在我们那里经过，蒋匪说我大哥和父亲与红军有关系，便将他们杀害了。现在我被解放了，我深深感到不打倒蒋介石，穷人永远翻不了身。我要报仇，参加解放军”。周玉清是河南人，他诉说道：“过去我家租种地主兼保长魏志代的地，有一年，年景不好，交不上租，父亲就活活叫魏打死了。母亲向村里老乡哀求了一领席子才埋了父亲；后来，母亲领我去讨饭，地主不给，母亲也饿死了。”诉到最后，他紧紧握拳，全身颤抖着，咬牙切齿的表示：“我要参加解放军，向那些吃人肉，喝人血的地主恶霸蒋介石报仇”。张充诉说因交不起租子，被地主赶到庙里，地主还不甘心，要强占他妹妹，逼得妹妹上吊死了，他诉到这里，早已哭不成声。下面战士们都哭了。李清栅诉说父亲病死，全家吃糠的惨状，一面擦着眼泪，坚决表示：“我不难过，我要坚决参军。上级叫我到那里都行，打完华北的敌人，再打华南的。”最后他号召大家说：“同志们！报仇的日子到了，我们要拿起枪杆，和蒋介石拼到底。”当场全体同志悲愤激昂，纷纷踊跃报名参军，为死难的父亲报仇，并在灵前宣誓说，保证为人民服务到底，不开小差，不彻底打垮蒋介石不回家。（赵质彬、王金座）
