　　◇Shandong Jiao Gao (newly established county, parts of Jiao County and Gaomi County) organized the people to repair water conservancy projects after the spring ploughing. Before the wheat harvest, they completed eleven sections of projects such as opening canals, dredging, straightening bends, and building dikes and blocking breaches on the main and branch streams of the Dagu River and the Jiao River. Now the flood discharge speed of the main rivers in the county has increased three times, and more than 478,000 mu of land along the rivers are free from floods, which can increase grain production by 110 million jin per year. Jiao County also newly opened and dredged ten rivers and built ten dikes before the wheat harvest, so that 100,000 mu of fertile land in 137 villages were free from floods, which can increase grain production by 5 million jin this year. Before the bamboo wheat harvest, the opening and dredging of the Eight Rivers was completed, benefiting more than 20,000 mu of land, which can increase production by more than 1.5 million jin.
　　◇After the land reform in Jin Sui, the feudal water conservancy old regulations were abolished, and with the government's assistance in providing grain loans, farmers in various places took advantage of the gap between summer hoeing to open canals and build dams, and use flood irrigation to improve the soil. According to incomplete materials from nine counties including Guoxian, Shanyin, and Hejin, a total of 21 canals have been completed, which can irrigate more than 60,000 mu of land and increase production by more than double.
