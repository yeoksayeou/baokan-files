Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 19th: After the city of Harbin began publicly disclosing Party branches and members in factories, businesses, government organs, and schools, initial experiences from the Harbin Power Plant indicate significant progress in reforming Party members, strengthening ties between the Party and the masses, leveraging the Party's leadership role among the masses, enhancing mass awareness, and increasing production enthusiasm among Party members and the masses.

　　The Harbin Power Plant originally had twelve Party members, most of whom were veteran industrial workers. Except for two young Party members, the remaining ten had over fourteen years of work experience. They possessed proficient skills and enjoyed credibility among the masses. However, before the public disclosure of the branch, due to a lack of practical Party education and other factors, only some Party members played a exemplary role in production, and the overall organizational role of the Party was weak, with many Party members being disconnected from the masses. Consequently, some workers reflected: "The locomotive runs on its own without telling us about the carriages!" "Activists only visit other activists' homes, who speaks for us?" In order to ensure that the masses had a full understanding of the Party before the branch was made public, the plant first conducted public Party education, explaining what the Communist Party is, who can join the Communist Party, how the Party came to be, the relationship between the Party and the masses, and the Party's current platform and ultimate goals. This emphasized the distinction between the Party and the trade union, and the relationship between immediate and long-term interests. This transformed past misconceptions among the masses, such as "Communists are all intellectuals" and "As long as you are selfless, don't do bad things, and work hard, you meet the requirements for joining the Party." During the public Party education process, branch offices were organized within the Party to overcome Party members' ideological concerns about the public disclosure of the Party. Initially, most Party members advocated for "disclosing good Party members, but not disclosing backward ones"; some advocated for "keeping both ends secret (i.e., good and bad members), and disclosing the middle" to facilitate the collection of opinions from outside the Party. After deliberations through group meetings, branch general meetings, and individual talks, discussing "what are the benefits of public disclosure of the branch" and "how to avoid being disconnected from the masses," everyone finally agreed to fully disclose all Party members. During this period, internal criticism and self-criticism were also conducted within the Party, reviewing the work of Party members and the relationship between Party members and the masses. At the branch general meeting, many opinions were raised not only about Party members who usually had many problems, but also about Party members who had been elected as labor heroes and held administrative responsibilities. After several such meetings, it was decided that several Party members with more serious disconnection from the masses should conduct self-criticism at the public branch mass meeting, publicly admitting their shortcomings and expressing their determination to correct them.

　　After the public disclosure of the branch, the masses, seeing Party members publicly criticize themselves and admit their shortcomings, said: "We always thought Party members were here to supervise us!" "Now that Party members are also open, who is good and who is bad, we still need to listen to our opinions, we are truly one family!" "The Communist Party says what it means, it doesn't fool people." On the Party member side, there was a general feeling that they had to study hard: "Before the disclosure, we were somewhat lax; now that it's public, the masses often ask this and that." Li Xue, the Party member with the most serious disconnection from the masses in the whole plant, whom the masses used to think was "incurable, even the factory director couldn't criticize him," humbly accepted the opinions of the masses after this public disclosure of the branch, and was completely different from before. The phenomenon of activists only visiting activists' homes has decreased, and the phenomenon of the masses only gossiping about Party members' problems behind their backs has also decreased significantly. The masses' concern for the Party has also increased significantly. Many workers have applied to join the Party. Among the first batch of sixteen formal applicants, eight were approved after public discussion by the masses and have been submitted to the general branch for approval according to the procedures for joining the Party. The workers who were accepted into the Party have greatly increased their enthusiasm for production. For example, welder Wang Yongqin, who used to seem to work very hard, but only welded two-thirds of an iron frame a day, welded a whole one a day after the masses agreed to his joining the Party and did not even feel tired. Workers who applied but were not approved by the masses after individual education said: "The Communist Party does not bury good people. I don't meet the requirements now, but if I work hard in the future, I can join the Party soon."

　　哈市发电厂公开支部
    进一步密切了党与群众的关系
  　提高了群众的觉悟和生产热忱
    【新华社东北十九日电】哈尔滨市工、商、机关、学校开始公开党的支部和党员后，根据该市发电厂的初步经验，在改造党员、密切党与群众的联系，发挥党在群众中的领导作用、提高群众觉悟、提高党员和群众的生产热忱等方面已收到很大效果。
    哈市发电厂原有十二个党员，其中大多数都是多年的产业工人，除两个青年党员外，其余十人工龄均在十四年以上；他们有熟练的技术，在群众中有信仰。但在支部公开前，由于缺乏实际的党的教育等原因，只有部分党员在生产中起了模范作用，整个党的组织作用很弱，许多党员脱离群众。因此，有的工人反映说：“火车头开动时光自己跑，也不告诉我们火车箱！”“积极分子家里跑，谁说咱们？”为了在支部公开前使群众对党有充分的认识，该厂首先进行公开的党的教育，说明什么是共产党，什么人才可以加入共产党，党是怎样来的，党与群众的关系，党的目前主张与最高纲领等；其中并着重说明党与工会的区别，目前利益与长远利益的关系。这样，使群众中间过去存在着的“共产党尽是知识分子”、“只要大公无私、坏事不干，好好干活就够入党条件”等错误认识有了转变。并在公开党的教育过程中，党内组织了分支部，克服党员对公开党的思想顾虑。最初多数党员都主张“公开好的党员，落后的不要公开”；有的主张“两头秘密（即好与坏的秘密），中间公开”，以便容易收集党外的意见。经过小组会、分支部大会及个别谈话酝酿，讨论了“支部公开有什么好处”、“怎样才能不脱离群众”，最后，一致同意了党员全部公开。在这期间，同时展开了党内的批评与自我批评，检讨党员工作和党员与群众的关系。在分支部大会上，不仅对平时毛病很多的党员，而且也对当选为劳动英雄及负行政责任的党员提了很多意见。经过几次这样的会议，大家决定，脱离群众比较严重的几个党员要在公开支部的群众大会上作自我批评，当众承认自己的缺点，并表示改正的决心。
    支部公开后，群众见党员当众自我批评，承认缺点，都说：“在早总以为党员是来监督咱们的！”“而今党员也公开了，谁好谁坏，还要听听咱们的意见，真是一家人了！”“共产党有啥说啥，真不唬弄人。”党员方面，则普遍感到非好好学习不成：“在早没公开，有些马马虎虎；现在公开了，群众经常问这个，问那个。”全厂脱离群众最严重的党员李学，过去群众认为他“没法治，厂长也批评不了他。”这次支部公开后，李学虚心接受群众意见，与前大不相同。从前积极分子光到积极分子家中串门的现象已经减少，群众对党员的毛病光在背地里叽咕的现象也很少了。群众对党的关心也显著提高，很多工人纷纷要求入党，第一批正式申请的十六人中，经过群众公议通过八名，已按入党手续送交总支批准。被接受入党的工人，生产情绪大大提高。如电焊工人王永勤，过去看来干得很卖力气，但一天才焊一个铁房架子的三分之二，群众公议同意其入党后，一天焊一个整的还不嫌累。报了名没有被群众公议通过的工人，经个别教育后说：“共产党不埋没好人，我现在不够条件，今后好好干也能很快入党。”
