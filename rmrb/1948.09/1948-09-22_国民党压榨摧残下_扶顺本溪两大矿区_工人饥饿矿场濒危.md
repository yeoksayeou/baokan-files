Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th: According to news from the Shenyang Xinbao, the Kuomintang government is doing everything possible to exploit and devastate the workers and mines of the two major mining areas of Fushun and Benxi. An article in the newspaper on August 22nd, entitled "The Miserable Fushun," stated: This Fushun Coal Mine, known as Asia's largest, is facing its final crisis. More than 30,000 workers have not received their salaries for June, July, and August, and are now living on bean cakes boiled with tree leaves. The article stated that workers at the Longfeng Mine are unable to work due to starvation, and the daily coal production is insufficient for power generation; insufficient power is preventing mine drainage. The normal water level of the mine is 150 meters below zero, but it has now risen to 10 meters below zero. If the power is cut off for three hours, the mine will be flooded and collapse, and it will spread to other mines. An August 19th dispatch in the newspaper, entitled "Benxi on the Decline," reported that workers at the Benxi Coal and Iron Mine are only receiving 2 million yuan in circulating currency each month, which, according to the market conditions published in the same newspaper on the same day, can only buy five catties of rice. Workers have not received the stipulated grain rations. The dispatch admits: "The life of workers in the 'bandit areas' (a slanderous term for the liberated areas) is good. Workers are successively and collectively abandoning their picks and tools here and fleeing to the 'bandit areas' to work."

　　国民党压榨摧残下 　 扶顺本溪两大矿区
  　工人饥饿矿场濒危
    【新华社东北十八日电】据沈阳新报消息，国民党政府对抚顺、本溪两大矿区的工人及矿场，竭尽压榨与摧残之能事。该报八月二十二日“悲惨的抚顺”一文称：此号称亚洲第一大矿场之抚顺煤矿，已临最后危机。现有工人三万余，六、七、八月均未领到薪水，现以树叶煮豆饼度日。该文称：该地龙凤矿场工人因无力工作，每日采煤不足发电之用；电力不足，使矿井无法进行排水工作。该井正常水位为零下一百五十米，现在涨至零下十米，如断电三小时，矿场即将为水淹塌；且将蔓延其他矿井。八月十九日该报“本溪走向下坡路”之通讯，报导本溪煤铁矿工人每月底只领流通券二百万元，按同日该报所载商情，此数只能买米五斤。规定配给的粮食，工人并未得到过。通讯承认：“‘匪区’（诬指解放区）工人生活好，工人们均陆续集体的丢下这里的镐头和工具，逃到‘匪区’去工作了。”
