(Taihang Electric) In early August, the Taihang District Party Committee held a joint meeting of all county party committees to convey the spirit of the North China Bureau's July meeting and to arrange winter work. The conference reviewed the land reform in the Taihang District over the past few years, explaining that land reform had been thorough. However, serious left-leaning errors had occurred during the land reform process, such as infringing upon the interests of middle peasants and industry and commerce. It was not until the land conference in the entire Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region last winter that the correction of these errors began. Since the implementation of the policy of combining large-scale production with rectification of deviations in the May conference this year, the work in the entire district has undergone significant changes. Currently, the thinking of cadres has been largely clarified, the volatile emotions of the masses and social order have stabilized, and the enthusiasm of the masses for production has also significantly increased. Based on the above specific circumstances, it was decided that the guiding principle for winter work should be to end land reform, rectify the Party, establish political power, and simultaneously launch a winter production campaign. The central task in the entire work process is Party rectification. In terms of work steps and arrangements, a large number of district and village cadres must be trained before the autumn harvest, with all district cadres receiving training and at least five or six village cadres being trained in each village. By late September, cadres should be in the villages. Each district should be divided into about five key points, and work teams should be organized to lead the work of each village in conjunction with village cadres. After arriving in the villages, the first task is to lead the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat planting, vigorously consolidate cooperatives, and prepare for winter production. At the same time, conduct investigations and research to understand the problems in land reform and Party rectification; and, without affecting production, complete the work of ending land reform in as many villages as possible. After the autumn harvest, preliminary rectification of the Party and peasant organizations should be carried out, and temporary people's congresses should be established to end land reform. After the end of land reform, Party rectification will be carried out, and this work must be done carefully and meticulously. After Party rectification, formal people's representatives and village committees will be elected, and the village-level democratic system will be established. In February and March of next year, a county-level people's congress will be convened to elect county-level governments, mobilize production, and launch a large-scale production campaign. Party rectification requires meticulousness and stability, and preparations should be made for Party rectification when land reform is completed. The establishment of political power should be combined with the end of land reform and Party rectification. For winter production, it is required to vigorously consolidate cooperatives before autumn and rely on cooperatives to carry out the work. After the end of land reform, areas where Party rectification has not yet taken place should focus on production, while areas where Party rectification is taking place should focus on Party rectification, while also taking care of production. The 500 experimental villages in the entire district (villages where land reform and democratic Party rectification were carried out this spring) must do a good job in the winter production campaign. When the production season arrives in February of next year, the entire district will fully launch a large-scale production campaign. The conference especially emphasized establishing clear policy thinking, strengthening organization and discipline, strengthening close ties between higher and lower levels, timely inspection and reporting, and opposing empiricism, in order to strengthen leadership.

　　太行县委联席会布置秋冬工作
  　结束土改进行整党
    建立民主制度开展大生产
    【太行电】八月初旬，太行区党委召开全区县委联席会议，传达华北局七月会议，布置冬季工作。大会对太行区几年来的土地改革作了回顾，说明土地改革已经彻底，但是在土改过程中，曾发生严重的左倾错误，如侵犯中农和工商业等。直到去冬晋冀鲁豫全区土地会议以后，才开始了对这些错误的纠正。今年五月会议转向大生产结合纠偏的方针施行以来，全区工作获得显著转变。目前干部思想大体澄清了，群众的动荡情绪和社会秩序已趋稳定，群众的生产积极性也显著提高了。根据以上具体情况，决定冬季工作的方针应该是结束土改、整党、建政，并平行的开展冬季生产运动。在整个工作中，以整党为中心。在工作的步骤与安排上，秋收以前必须大量训练区村干部，区干部普训一遍，村干部每村至少训练五六人。九月下旬干部都要到村。每区划分五个左右的基点，组织工作组，结合村干部，领导各村工作。到村之后，首先要领导秋收、秋耕、种麦，大力整顿合作社，准备冬季生产。同时进行调查研究，了解土改及整党中的问题；并在不影响生产的条件下，尽可能进行一部村庄结束土改的工作。秋收后，即初步整顿党与农民等组织，建立临时的人代会，进行结束土改。土改结束后，进行整党，这一工作要求谨慎而细致的去做。整党之后，选举正式人民代表和村政委员会，把村级民主制度建立起来。明年二、三月间，召开县级人民代表会，选举县级政府，动员生产，开展大规模的生产运动。对整党要求细致稳当，并在结束土改时，为整党作准备。对建政，要求与结束土改和整党结合进行。对于冬季生产，要求在秋前大力整顿合作社，依托合作社进行。土改结束之后，暂时不整党的地方以生产为主，整党的地方以整党为中心，同时照顾生产。整党完了即全力进行生产。全区五百个实验村（今年春天进行土改、民主整党的村），一定要把冬季生产运动搞好。到明年二月生产季节到来，全区即全力开展大生产运动。会议特别强调树立明确的政策思想，加强组织性，纪律性，密切上下连系，及时检查汇报，反对经验主义，以加强领导。
