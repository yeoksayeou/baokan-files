　　The Masses Should Not Be Beaten or Cursed
    Editor:
    Wang, the District Chief of the 11th District of Xian County, has a serious problem of beating the masses and village cadres. In mid-July, due to the issue of breaching the dike, he slapped Gong Guanglin, the sixty-year-old head of a family of military dependents in Fujiagang, twice. He also tied up Gong Sanxing, the village deputy, with ropes overnight and beat him with two sticks. In early August, because of a divorce issue in a certain village, District Chief Wang beat the grandmother so hard that she knelt on the ground and begged him for mercy. This practice seriously violates the laws of our democratic government. We believe that District Chief Wang should conduct a thorough review and self-reflection.

    Editor's Note: Cursing and raising a hand to strike someone is a feudal bureaucratic practice. It violates the laws of the democratic government that protect human rights. As a working cadre of the democratic government, one should resolutely oppose and eliminate this bad practice. The deplorable behavior of District Chief Wang of the 11th District of Xian County, who beats and curses the masses at will, cannot be tolerated. In addition to District Chief Wang conducting a thorough self-criticism and resolutely correcting his behavior, we hope that the Xian County government will promptly investigate and handle the matter, and publish the results of the handling in this newspaper to educate everyone.

　　不应打骂群众编辑同志：
    献县第十一区王区长，有打群众打村干部的严重现象。七月中旬因为扒堤问题，打了富家庄六十多岁的抗属主任巩广林两个耳光，又把村副巩三兴用绳子绑了一夜，并打了两棒。八月初某村群众因离婚问题，王区长又把那婆婆打得跪在地上向他求饶。这种作风严重违犯我民主政府法令，我们认为王区长应很好进行检讨反省。

    编者按：张口骂人举手打人，这是一种封建官僚作法，这是违反民主政府保障人权法令的，身为民主政府的工作干部，更应坚决反对与肃清这种恶劣作风。象献县十一区王区长这种随便打骂群众的恶劣作风，是不能容许的，除王区长应彻底检讨坚决改正外，希望献县县政府迅速检查处理，并将处理结果在本报公开发表，以教育大家。
