　　Korea Establishes New Type of Democratic State
　　Polish Workers' Party Clears Rightist Deviation
　　The Korean Supreme People's Assembly, "the only legitimate Korean supreme legislative power organ in the whole country" elected by 85.2 percent of voters from all over Korea, successfully completed its historically significant first session from September 2nd to 10th. It passed the constitution of the People's Democratic Republic; it elected the Presidium of the Assembly; it formed "a general national government established by the will of the people of North and South Korea"; it proposed to promote the Land Reform Law, the Industrial Nationalization Law, the Labor Law, the Women's Equality Law, and other democratic reforms that have been implemented in North Korea to the whole country, and to oppose the American monopoly capital's colonization of Korea, to oppose the revival of Japanese imperialism, and to strengthen the Korean People's Army and other correct political programs; it issued a note requesting the immediate simultaneous withdrawal of troops by the United States and the Soviet Union. Since the Soviet Union has repeatedly expressed its willingness to withdraw troops simultaneously with the United States since September last year, this note is in fact a powerful condemnation of American imperialism, which continues to unreasonably occupy South Korea and support a puppet regime in South Korea. The establishment of the national Korean Supreme People's Assembly and the national democratic government demonstrates "the political unity of the vast majority of people in North and South Korea," indicating that the Korean people, relying on their own unity and strength, have entered a new period of struggle for the liberation and independence of all of Korea. A new type of country, admired by all oppressed nations, has been erected on the Asian continent. The success of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly, the unity and strength of the Korean people, have greatly shocked the South Korean reactionaries and their American masters: Syngman Rhee, the puppet president of South Korea, admitted that thousands of people in South Korea have been arrested for participating in the election of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly; a special martial law has now been declared in Seoul; and the U.S. occupation forces have expressed in various ways that they will remain stationed in South Korea indefinitely.
　　The Central Committee of the Polish Workers' Party, at its plenary session held from August 31st to September 3rd, successfully cleared the rightist ideology and nationalist errors deviation within the party, headed by the former General Secretary Gomulka. The plenary session passed a resolution, pointing out that the root of this deviation was the idea of ​​overestimating the reactionary forces and underestimating the weak and incompetent thinking of the revolutionary forces. Therefore, it lacked confidence and loyalty to the working class, relaxed the class struggle, and had an unclear understanding of the role of the Soviet Communist Party in the international anti-imperialist camp. The resolution called on the whole party to launch criticism and self-criticism, and strengthen learning to correct the above-mentioned erroneous deviation. This resolution of the plenary session was sincerely supported by the whole party, and Gomulka also openly admitted his mistakes. The current General Secretary of the Workers' Party and President of Poland, Beirut, pointed out: "The Workers' Party has extricated itself from the crisis and has become stronger and more robust than in the past."
　　The League for the Defense of Democracy, initiated by the Japanese Communist Party as a prototype of a people's front organization, has been formed in Japan. In a letter to Wallace, it stated that its goals are to defend political freedom, world peace, national independence, and oppose the revival of fascist forces. It joined the fight against the anti-strike law as soon as it was born. The strike struggles of Japanese railway workers and communications workers are still continuing. "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Japanese working class is putting up a tenacious resistance to the attempt of imperialism to establish a colonial regime in Japan. The Japanese democratic forces have now become a powerful unit in the world democratic camp." (Labor News) The Soviet Union has repeatedly insisted at and after the meetings of the Allied Council for Japan that the reactionary authorities of the United States and Japan must abolish anti-labor directives, orders, and suppressive actions.
　　The movement of the Indonesian people to resist the Dutch aggressors has been developing again. The Indonesian Communist Party issued an appeal, calling on the people to prepare to meet the new aggression of the Netherlands, and must fight for their freedom by all means. The brutal suppression and "sweeping" of the Dutch army in the occupied areas of Java has further aroused the armed resistance of the local people. The new provocations of the Dutch army against the Republic of Indonesia have aroused local resistance from the Indonesian army in some areas of East and West Java. Indonesian youths in Yogyakarta held demonstrations against the Hatta government's continued negotiations that would lead to the betrayal of national sovereignty and humiliation.
　　Other important international events in recent times are as follows:
　　(1) The meeting of representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on the disposal of former Italian colonies was held in Paris from the 13th to the 15th at the suggestion of the Soviet Union. Because the United States, Britain, and France had the intention of circumventing the Soviet Union and dividing the former Italian colonies among themselves, the meeting did not achieve any results.
　　(2) The Greek Democratic Army won another great victory. In the Vitsi-Florina area in the far north of Greece, in continuous operations from August 24th to September 13th, nearly 8,000 enemies were killed, wounded, or captured, and an unprecedented amount of enemy equipment and military supplies were seized.
　　(3) Italian guerrilla fighters commemorated the "Resistance Day" of the Italian people on September 8th. Italian Communist leader Togliatti issued a message on the anniversary, calling on the people to unite and declaring that "the ideals and programs of the resistance movement still live in the hearts of the best sons and daughters of Italy."
　　(4) On September 12th, all cities in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany held conferences to commemorate the victims of the Nazi rule era. In Berlin, 400,000 working people held a large anti-fascist demonstration. Delegations from the Soviet Union, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, Free Greece, and Free Spain participated.
　　(5) The Third International Congress of the Democratic Lawyers Association, attended by representatives from 16 countries, was held in Prague from September 6th to 10th. The conference passed resolutions on guaranteeing human rights, opposing propaganda for new wars, and punishing war criminals and collaborators.
　　(6) The long-prepared war of the Indian army against the Hyderabad State broke out on the 13th. (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th)

### 朝鲜建立新型民主国家　波工人党清算右倾偏向

　　朝鲜建立新型民主国家
  　波工人党清算右倾偏向
    朝鲜最高人民议会，这个由全朝鲜百分之八十五点二选民选出的“真正全国的唯一合法的朝鲜最高立法权力机关”，已于九月二日至十日胜利地完成其有历史意义的首届会议。它通过了人民民主共和国宪法；它选出了议会主席团；它组成了“为南北朝鲜人民的意志所建立的总的全国政府”；它提出了将土地改革法、工业国有化法、劳工法、妇女平等法以及在北朝鲜已实行的其他民主改革，推行到全国去，以及反对美国垄断资本殖民地化朝鲜，反对复活日本帝国主义，加强朝鲜人民军等正确政纲；它发出了要求美苏立即同时撤兵的照会，而由于苏联自去年九月以来即屡次表示与美国同时撤兵的愿望，因而，这一照会事实上对于继续无理盘踞南朝鲜、在南朝鲜扶植伪政权的美国帝国主义是有力的声讨。全国性的朝鲜最高人民议会和全国民主政府的建立，表现了“朝鲜南北两部绝大多数人民的政治团结”，说明朝鲜人民依靠自己的团结和力量，进入了为全部朝鲜的解放与独立而斗争的新时期。亚洲大陆上已经矗立起一个为所有被压迫民族所欣慕的新型国家。朝鲜最高人民议会的成功，朝鲜人民的团结与力量，已使南朝鲜反动派及其美国主子大为震惊：南韩伪总统，承晚承认，南朝鲜人民因参加朝鲜最高人民议会的选举而被捕者已达数千人；汉城现已宣布特别戒严；美占领军则以各种方式表示将无限期留驻南朝鲜。
    波兰工人党中央委员会在八月三十一日至九月三日召开的全会上，胜利地清算了以前总书记哥穆尔卡为首的党内右倾思想和民族主义的错误偏向。全会通过决议，指出这种偏向的根源是过高估计反动力量，过低估计革命力量的软弱无能思想，因此，对工人阶级的力量缺乏信心和忠诚，放松了阶级斗争，并对苏联共产党在国际反帝国主义阵营中的作用认识不清。决议号召全党展开批评与自我批评，加强学习，以纠正上述错误偏向。全会这一决议受到全党的衷心拥护，哥穆尔卡亦公开承认了自己的错误。工人党现任总书记波兰总统贝鲁特指出：“工人党已自危机中解脱出来，并变得比过去更加壮大坚强了”。
    由日共发起的、作为人民阵线组织雏型的保卫民主同盟，已在日本组成。它在致华莱士的信中表示，其目标为保卫政治自由、世界和平、国家独立和反对法西斯力量的复活。它一诞生就参加了反对反罢工法的战斗。日本铁道工人、递信工人的罢工斗争仍在继续中。“日本工人阶级在共产党的领导下，对帝国主义在日本建立殖民地政权的企图，正予以顽强的抵抗。日本民主力量现已成为世界民主阵营的一个强大的单位。”（劳动报）苏联在盟国对日委员会的会议上和会议后，一再坚持美日反动当局必须取消反劳工的指令、命令与镇压行为。
    印尼人民再度起来抗击荷兰侵略者的运动正在发展中。印尼共产党发出呼吁，号召人民准备迎击荷兰的新侵略，必须以一切方法为自己的自由而战。荷军在爪哇侵占区的残酷镇压与“扫荡”，更加激起当地人民的武装反抗。荷军对印尼共和国的新挑衅，已激起印尼军在东西爪哇若干地区的局部抵抗。日惹印尼青年曾举行示威，反对哈达政府继续丧权辱国的谈判。
    最近时期国际上之其他重要事件如下：
    （一）关于处置前意大利殖民地的苏、美、英、法四国代表会议，在苏联的提议之下于十三日至十五日在巴黎召开。由于美、英、法存有避开苏联并在他们自己之间瓜分前意属殖民地的企图，此次的会议未获任何结果。
    （二）希腊民主军又获大捷。在希腊极北部之维齐——佛罗里那地区，在八月二十四日至九月十三日的连续作战中，毙伤俘敌人近八千名，缴获敌人的装备和军事物资空前众多。
    （三）意大利游击队战士们于九月八日纪念意大利人民的“抵抗运动日”。意共领袖托格里亚蒂在纪念日发表文告，号召人民团结，并宣示“抵抗运动的理想与纲领仍然活在意大利最优秀儿女的心里”。
    （四）九月十二日，德境苏占区一切城市都举行了纪念法西斯统治时代受难者的大会。在柏林，四十万劳动人民举行了反法西斯大示威，苏联、法国、波兰、捷克、挪威、丹麦、奥地利、瑞士、匈牙利、自由希腊、自由西班牙都派有代表团参加。
    （五）有十六国代表参加的民主律师协会第三届国际大会于九月六日至十日在布拉格举行。大会通过关于保障人权、反对新战争宣传及惩办战犯与通敌分子的决议。
    （六）准备已久的印度军队对海德拉巴土邦的战争已于十三日爆发。（新华社陕北二十日电）
