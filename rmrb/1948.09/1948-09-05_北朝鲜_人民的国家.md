　　North Korea – A People's Country

　　In August 1945, with the assistance of the powerful Soviet Red Army, the people of North Korea were liberated from nearly half a century of enslavement by Japanese imperialism. Today, the ten million people of North Korea, who account for 40 percent of the total Korean population, are building their paradise on this free land and have become a beacon inspiring the people of South Korea, enslaved by US imperialism, to fight.

　　Before liberation, North Korea was the domain of Japanese monopoly capital and colonizers. It concentrated most of Korea's heavy industry, hydroelectric power, chemical industry, and coal and iron mining. The total value of industrial production accounted for about 50.2 percent of all of Korea, of which the total value of metal, power generation, and chemical industries accounted for more than 80 percent of all of Korea. The total value of agricultural production accounted for about 37.6 percent of the national production. The vast majority of farmers had no land, and tenant farmers accounted for 45 percent of the total number of tenant farmers in the country.

　　After the Red Army entered, North Korea underwent a fundamental change: all factories, mines, railways, banks, etc. belonging to Japanese monopoly capital and Korean traitors were nationalized and handed over to the people's government for management. The land of Japanese colonizers and Korean traitors was confiscated and distributed without compensation to farmers who had no land or little land. 683,000 farming households received nearly one million hectares of cultivated land. Since liberation, the national economy has recovered and developed at a rapid pace. In the past two years, the output of industrial products has increased fourfold, and similar success has been achieved in improving agricultural production. The railway network and road networks have also fully returned to normal.

　　Korea's first people's representative organ, the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea, was officially established in Pyongyang in February 1946 through universal elections. In November of the same year, official elections were held for the People's Committees of provinces, cities, counties, and townships. All citizens who have reached the age of twenty, regardless of their gender, property, education, belief, or residence, have the right to vote and stand for election. 4.6 million voters participated in the voting, accounting for 99.6 percent of all voters, and elected representatives of all sectors of the people, including workers, farmers, staff, intellectuals, businessmen, industrialists, former landlords, and religious professionals, to participate in the people's representative organs at all levels. By February 1947, the formal People's Committee of North Korea was formed at the congress of representatives of the People's Committees in various regions. This is the highest organ of power that truly represents the interests of all sectors of North Korea except Korean traitors. Of the 21 members of the People's Committee, the Korean Workers' Party (the name after the merger of the Korean Communist Party and the Korean New Democratic Party), which represents the vast majority of workers and peasants, accounts for 11 members; the Korean Democratic Party, which represents general public educators, progressive intellectuals, national capitalists, and upper-class figures from all walks of life, accounts for 3 members; the Young Friends Party, which represents urban business circles and general middle-class figures, accounts for 2 members; and non-party members account for 5 members. Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean Workers' Party who insisted on the anti-Japanese struggle, was elected as chairman, and among the two vice-chairmen, one was Kim Chaek, another leader of the Workers' Party, and the other was Hong Ki-ju, the leader of the Democratic Party. In April of this year, amidst the joy of the people, the North Korean People's Assembly passed the Charter of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　北朝鲜——人民的国家
    一九四五年八月，北朝鲜人民在强大苏联红军协助下，从日本帝国主义将近半世纪的奴役中获得了解放。今天，占朝鲜总人口百分之四十的一千万北朝鲜人民，正在这片自由的土地上，建设自己的乐园，并已成为鼓舞在美帝奴役下的南朝鲜人民奋斗的灯塔。
    北朝鲜在解放以前，是日本独占资本与殖民者的天地。这里集中了朝鲜大部分的重工业、水力发电、化学工业与煤、铁等矿业。工业生产总值约占全朝鲜百分之五十点二，其中五金、发电、化学等工业生产总值，均占全朝鲜百分之八十以上，农业生产总额约占全国生产的百分之三十七点六。广大的农民没有土地，佃农占全国佃农总数的百分之四十五。
    当红军进入以后，北朝鲜的面貌，就起了根本变化：一切属于日本独占资本与韩奸的工厂、矿山、铁道、银行等全部收归国有，交给人民政权管理，日本殖民者与韩奸的土地被没收，无代价地分给无地和少地的农民，有六十八万三千户农家，获得了将近一百万公顷的耕地。解放以来，国民经济以飞跃的速度恢复与发展。过去两年中，工业品产量增加了四倍，在提高农业生产上也获得类似的成功。铁路网与各线公路网亦已完全恢复常态。
    朝鲜第一个人民代表机关——北朝鲜临时人民委员会，在一九四六年二月普选中于平壤正式成立。同年十一月，举行了各省、市、县、乡人民委员会的正式选举。凡年满二十岁的公民，不问其性别、财产、教育程度、信仰以及居住等状况，一律有选举权与被选举权。有四百六十万选民参加了投票，占全部选民百分之九十九点六，选出了包括工人、农民、职员、知识分子、商人、工业家、旧地主以及宗教职业者等各阶层人民的代表，参加各级人民代表机关。至一九四七年二月，正式的北朝鲜人民委员会，便在各地区人民委员会的代表大会上产生。这是一个真正代表除韩奸以外北朝鲜各阶层利益的最高政权机关。在人民委员会的二十一名委员中，代表广大工农的朝鲜劳动党（朝鲜共产党与朝鲜新民党合并后的名称）占十一名，代表一般公教人员、进步知识分子、民族资本家及各界上层分子的朝鲜民主党占三名；代表城市工商界及一般中产分子的青友党占二名；无党无派者五名。坚持抗日斗争的朝鲜劳动党领袖金日成荣任主席，二名副主席中，一为劳动党的另一领袖金策，一为民主党领袖洪箕畴。今年四月，在人民的欢欣鼓舞中，北朝鲜人民议会通过了朝鲜人民民主共和国宪章。（新华社）
