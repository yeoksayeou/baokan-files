　　【Taiyue Telegram】Qinshui began rectifying and restoring mutual aid teams in June and has achieved preliminary experience: (1) Party members and cadres should personally lead the rectification, acknowledge the past mistakes of forced mutual aid, and emphasize the implementation of the principle of voluntary exchange of equal value. This not only rectifies the mutual aid but also restores the authority of the leadership. (2) Thoroughly understand the reasons for the collapse, examine the problems in past mutual aid, and thoroughly rectify and transform. For example, in the Li Zhenwen team of Guzhen Village, District 1, a meeting was first held to examine the problems. It was found that Cui Zhuguo and others plowed the land for households without cattle last year but did not earn fodder, which made them unwilling to help each other and gradually withdrew. This team truly solved the problems identified in the examination, and everyone agreed to reorganize. (3) The organization of mutual aid teams should be based on families to ensure that the family's production pace is consistent, which can reduce conflicts between husband and wife and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and can combine family odd jobs with the collective labor of the mutual aid team. (4) Production plans and various systems should be democratically established, and the regulations for wages, work point evaluation, accounting time, and work review should be decided through democratic discussion and not by coercion. (5) Accounts should be settled in a timely manner according to the production season so that what is earned can be obtained early to solve one's own difficulties. Wages should be paid in installments to avoid accumulating them until they cannot be paid at once. At the same time, in the case of unstable prices, it is better to settle wages in a timely manner, which can also stimulate those who pay wages to work hard and strive to pay less. (6) The labor unit of the mutual aid team should not be too large, as poor planning with too many people easily wastes time. The order of doing work is also difficult to resolve. Large teams can be divided into several sub-teams to do work, but efforts should be made to achieve unified leadership.

　　沁水整顿互助获得六项经验
    【太岳电】沁水在六月开始整顿与恢复互助组，已取得初步经验：（一）党员干部应亲自领导整顿，承认过去强迫互助的错误，强调贯彻自愿等价的原则。这样作既整顿了互助，又恢复了领导威信。（二）深入了解垮台的原因，检查过去互助中的毛病，彻底整顿改造。如一区固镇村李振文组，先开会检查毛病，发现崔柱国等去年给没牛户犁了地，没赚上草料，弄得不想互助，慢慢的退后了。这个组真正解决了检查出的毛病，大家都同意重新组织起来。（三）组织互助组，应以家庭为单位，作到家庭生产步调一致，可以减少夫妇间与婆媳间的矛盾，并可使家庭零活和互助组集体劳动结合起来。（四）民主订出生产计划和各种制度，规定工资，评定工分，算帐时间，工作检讨等，都要经过民主讨论决定，不能强迫命令。（五）按生产季节及时算帐，该得的可以早得，解决自己的困难。该出工资的零星出了，免得积累起来一下出不起。同时在物价不稳的情况下，及时清理工资是比较好的，也能刺激出工资的人好好劳动，争取少出工资。（六）互助组的劳动单位不宜过大，人多计划不好，容易浪费时间。做活先后问题也不好解决。组大的可分为几个小组做活，但要设法作到统一领导。
