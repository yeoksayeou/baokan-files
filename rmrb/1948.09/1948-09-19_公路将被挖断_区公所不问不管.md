　　Highway to Be Dug Up
  　District Office Turns a Blind Eye

To the Editor:

    The motor vehicle highway from Hengjian Mine to Fengshan Mine, belonging to the Jingxing Coal Mine, has a section near the east side of Hengjian Town that is about to be cut off due to local villagers digging for soil. This section of road is 7.3 meters wide. Currently, a large pit has been dug on the east side of the road, measuring 4.2 meters wide, 2.5 meters deep, and 9.4 meters long. More than half of it has been excavated, and some has collapsed due to rain, making it very dangerous for large carts to pass, and cars dare not use it at all. Another section, over one meter wide, has been dug up not far south of this pit. Nearby villagers still frequently dig there, greatly hindering both public and private transportation. The Jingxing Coal Mine Company has repeatedly suggested to the Hengjian District Office (Fourth District) that they stop this behavior and repair the road to facilitate vehicle passage, but the District Office has ignored these requests. This section of highway is less than half a kilometer from the front of their District Office. Their staff members often pass by it. Can't they see it? We believe that the working attitude of the responsible comrades of the Fourth District Office deserves scrutiny! (Jing Cun)

　　公路将被挖断
  　区公所不问不管编辑同志：
    井陉煤矿从横涧矿到凤山矿的汽车公路，挨近横涧镇村东边，有一段路被当地老百姓挖土挖的快要断了。该段路宽七米三，现在从路东边被挖了一个大坑，宽四米二，深二米五，长九米四，被挖了一半多，雨后又被冲塌些，大车过都很危险，汽车更不敢通行。离这段坑不远的南边又挖了一段，有一米多。现附近老乡还是常去挖，公私运输都受到很大阻碍。井陉煤矿公司曾几次建议横涧区公所（四区）制止此行为并加修补，以利车轮通行，但该区公所置之不理。该段公路距他们区公所门前尚不到一里地，他们工作人员常由此经过，难道就看不见吗？我们觉得四区公所负责同志此种工作态度值得检查！（竞存）
