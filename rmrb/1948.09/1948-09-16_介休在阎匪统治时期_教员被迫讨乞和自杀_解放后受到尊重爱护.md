[Jinzhong News] In Jiexiu, under the tyrannical rule of the local tyrant Yan Xishan, many educators were treated as "disguised" elements, suffering all kinds of humiliation and abuse. Since the city's liberation, educators have been respected and cherished. Most young people have obtained ample opportunities to study freely. In the teachers' training courses for middle and primary schools, run by the democratic government, a middle school student from Jiexiu, Kang Yunqi, wrote in his record of observations on the democratic government's entry into the city: "From July 17th, the people of Jiexiu truly tasted the flavor of democracy and freedom!" After seven or eight days of short-term study, the teachers' desire to pursue progress was greatly encouraged. The teachers have been actively denouncing Yan's crimes. Cheng Xiangjiu, who taught at Jiexiu Middle School for two or three decades, said: The bandit Yan brought back his henchmen, such as the "Comrades Association," from western Shanxi, treating intellectual youths who did not cooperate with the Japanese, Yan, special agents, and traitors as dissidents and anti-Yan factions. A primary school teacher in Zhanglan Town, because he refused to be bullied by Japanese invaders and traitors at Zhanglan Station, and taught near the border of the liberated area, was regarded as a "disguised" element by Yan's special agents, arrested, and tortured to force him to admit that he had relations with the Sacrifice League and the Eighth Route Army. Cheng Xiangjiu himself, because he refused to serve the enemy and opened a shop at home to make a living, was regarded by Yan's bandits as a "Communist cultural element" and an anti-Yan faction, and was arrested for investigation three times. He was detained in prison for fifty-eight days, and later escaped to the Taigu liberated area to live.

Many educators in the urban area, after losing their land under Yan's "soldier-farmer integration" tyranny, had to rely solely on teaching for a living, but the education section chief of Yan's county government still had to "eat two hairs" (meaning bribes) from them. Li Xinmei and other teachers from the Central Primary School in Shuncheng Street said: Becoming a teacher does not depend on knowledge, but on connections. You have to send a stone of wheat to the enemy's education section chief before you can become a teacher. People with knowledge cannot become teachers, but the enemy county magistrate's two guards filled three teacher vacancies. Teachers had to assist enemy township cadres in urging the collection of grain and force the masses to pay grain for Yan's bandits in order to beg for grain from the township government, and the collected grain was sent to Taiyuan. The teachers could not be sure where their next meal would come from. Li Shiying, the principal of Zhanglan, wrote in his life memories: "Since the 'soldier-farmer integration,' my wife and children at home could not live. My son and I went out to teach. In addition to teaching every day, we had to beg from door to door. We were in danger of running out of food every day, and we were extremely mentally distressed and our lives were miserable!"

Yan's bandits' massacre of educators was especially cruel. In this year's "political rescue" movement in the first month, one-third of the more than 300 people were punished as "disguised" elements. A female teacher said: As long as a special agent targets you, you can't escape being beaten and humiliated. Guo Lixiang, a teacher in Yi'an, was driven to mental disorder by Yan's special agents, shouting and screaming in the middle of the night and jumping to his death. Teacher Sun Ziping was forced to jump into a toilet. Yan's bandits' tyranny has completely lost its deceptive effect from the personal experiences of people from all walks of life.

　　介休在阎匪统治时期
  　教员被迫讨乞和自杀
  　解放后受到尊重爱护
    【晋中讯】介休的教育界，在土皇帝阎锡山暴政统治下，很多被当作“伪装”分子受尽各种侮辱和摧残。该城解放后，教育界人士现已得到尊重与爱护。大部青年已获充分自由学习机会，在民主政府举办之中小学百余教员训练班中，一位介休中学生康运起，在他对民主政府入城设施的观感录上写着：“从七月十七号这一天起，介休人民真正尝到了民主自由的滋味！”经过七、八天短期的学习，大大鼓舞了教员们追求进步的要求。教员们纷纷控诉阎匪的罪行。曾在介休中学教学二三十年的成象九诉说：阎贼从晋西带着他的爪牙“同志会”等回来，把不与日、阎、特务、汉奸合作的知识青年都当作异己反阎派看待。张兰镇一位高小教员，因不愿在张兰车站受日寇汉奸欺侮，到靠近解放区边沿教学，就被阎特当作“伪装”分子，抓去非刑拷打，逼他承认和牺盟会八路军有关系。成象九本人也因不甘事敌，在家开铺子谋生，被阎匪视作“共产党的文化分子”和反阎派，先后抓去考查三次。在监狱里押了五十八天，后逃到太谷解放区生活。
    城关许多教育界人士，在阎匪“兵农合一”暴政下失掉土地后，不得不专靠教学谋生，但阎匪县府教育科长，还要从中“吃二毛”（贿赂之意）。顺城街中心小学教员李新梅等说：当教员不是凭知识，而是凭关系。得先向敌教育科长送一石麦子，才能当教员。有知识的人不能当教员，而敌县长的两个警卫员却顶了三处教员空额。当教员的为着向乡公所讨粮，得协助敌乡干部催征粮款，替阎匪威逼群众缴粮，缴的粮食都送到太原。教员们吃了上顿接不上下顿。张兰校长李世英在他的生活回忆中写着：“兵农合一以来，家中妻子没法生活，我与儿子出外教学，每天除教学外，还得沿门乞讨，日有断炊之虑，精神上痛苦万分；生活上苦不堪言！”
    阎匪对教育界人士的屠杀，尤其残忍。在今年正月“政治救护”运动中，三百余人，就有三分之一被当作“伪装”分子来惩办。一位女教员说：只要特务分子瞄准你，怎也逃不脱挨打受辱。义安教员郭立相被阎特逼的神经失常，半夜大呼乱叫，跳楼而死。教员孙子平被逼跳了厕所。阎匪的暴政，已从各阶层人民切身利益的体验中，完全丧失了他的欺骗作用。　　　　　　（冰如、春旬）
