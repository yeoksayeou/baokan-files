　　【Taihang Electric Dispatch】The Taihang Military Region People's Armed Forces Department issued a directive on August 30th to all areas, instructing them to earnestly conduct participation education and organizational rectification, utilizing the current production season and gaps in the war, to prepare for large-scale participation tasks. The directive first requires strengthening current affairs education for militiamen and laborers, ensuring that everyone understands that only by eliminating Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang reactionary clique can peaceful production and construction be carried out. It is particularly important to establish the concept of fighting to establish a People's Democratic Republic. Secondly, support-the-front education should be treated as an important part of social education, allowing every member of the masses to understand how they should consciously support the war. The content of the education includes two aspects: one is production savings and financial support, and the other is labor support through the mobilization of manpower and animal power. To this end, it is necessary to enhance the masses' understanding of the unity of current and long-term interests, and to enhance the masses' understanding of the unity of individual family interests and national interests. Thirdly, it is necessary to rectify participation organizations according to the needs of the front line, implement scientific organization, strive for cadre stabilization, and establish company-level organizations to ensure good organization in peacetime and rapid mobilization when needed. It is necessary to strengthen organizational discipline education, overcome the phenomenon of some cadres being afraid to lead and extreme democracy resulting in disorganization and indiscipline. In addition, military training and exercises must be carried out, such as air defense, marching, camping, utilizing terrain and ground features, dispatching quartermaster services, and disassembling stretchers.

　　太行人民武装部指示各地
  　加强参战教育整顿组织
    【太行电】太行军区人民武装部八月三十日指示各地，利用目前生产季节与战争空隙，认真进行参战教育与组织整顿，以准备迎接大规模的参战任务。指示首先要求加强民兵民工的时事教育，要使大家认识只有消灭蒋介石及国民党反动集团，才能进行和平生产建设。并特别要树立为建立人民民主共和国而战斗的观念。其次应把支前教育作为社会教育的重要部分，让每个群众懂得自己该如何自觉的去支援战争。教育内容包括两方面，一方面是生产节约，财力支援，一方面是出动人力畜力的劳力支援。为此就必须提高群众对目前利益和长远利益统一的认识，提高群众个人的家庭利益与国家利益统一的认识。再次，要根据前线战争需要，整顿参战组织，实行科学编制，并求得干部固定化，成立连队组织，做到平时组织好，用时调动快。要加强组织纪律教育，克服某些干部不敢领导和极端民主的无组织无纪律现象。另外，必须进行军事训练和演习。如防空、行军、宿营、利用地形地物、派遣勤务、拆卸担架等。
