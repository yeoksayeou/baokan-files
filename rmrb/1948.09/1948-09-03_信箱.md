　　To Comrade Gu Lichen: Regarding the issue of a certain factory infringing upon your property, we have forwarded the original letter to the Taihang District Party Committee and requested them to investigate and handle it.
　　To Comrade Yang Linchuan: The issue you raised regarding the wrongly labeled middle peasant is too vague to answer. You can directly apply to the county and district leaders to resolve it based on the specific situation.
　　To Comrade Wang Shucheng: It is true that many characters in the July 17th newspaper you mentioned were unclear. This was indeed due to carelessness in printing and distribution, and newspapers with unclear prints were sent out. We should apologize to the readers and strive to check and improve.
　　To Comrade Wang Zhizhong: The specific issues you raised, such as the cooperative making vinegar from barley, should be resolved in consultation with the higher authorities based on the situation in your village. The letter is not detailed enough, making it difficult to answer.
　　To Comrade Gu Wenying from Gaoyi, Comrade Huang Menxiao from Lingshou, and the reading group in Yechang Village, Wutai: Your letters have been forwarded to your respective county committees and we have requested them to investigate and handle them.
　　To Comrade Wang Qiaomin: Regarding the issue of the Handan City Public Security Bureau detaining Wang Zhitong and others for two months without explanation, we have forwarded your letter to the Handan City Committee and requested them to investigate.
