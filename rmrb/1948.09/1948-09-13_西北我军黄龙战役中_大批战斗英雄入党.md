Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 10th. In the battle where the Northwest People's Liberation Army annihilated the Hu bandit 36th Division, a movement to kill the enemy, perform meritorious service, and join the Party, transfer Party membership, and strive to be a model Party member was launched. The Party Committee of the Second Battalion of a certain unit worked out specific methods for joining the Party at the front line, stipulating that victory news and heroic figures in the battle should be disseminated in a timely manner on the battlefield. Those who have demonstrated sufficient qualifications as a Party member in completing the most difficult combat tasks can have their application to join the Party accepted and be admitted into the Party. In three consecutive days of fighting, a certain unit admitted a large number of soldiers who had performed meritorious service into the Party, transferred Party membership, and elected model Party members. The Third Detachment of the Fourth Company re-elected its branch committee and rectified the branch and Party member groups within hours after the Wang Village battle. Party member Ma Shiren continued to fire steadily holding the gun body after his machine gun stock was shot off by the enemy in the battle, preventing the enemy from counterattacking, and was selected as a model Party member. Correspondents Zhou Daodi and Zhang Zhicai were approved to join the Party; the transfer of three probationary Party members was discussed and approved. The branch also posthumously recognized Li Xingzhong (probationary Party member), who heroically sacrificed in the battle, and Fu Hengxiang, a soldier who had requested to join the Party, as official Party members. Wang Changfa, a seventeen-year-old soldier from the Fifth Platoon, braved enemy artillery fire to climb onto the village, throwing grenades at the enemy, covering the whole platoon to climb up one after another, forcing fifty to sixty enemies to lay down their weapons and surrendering one heavy machine gun, two light machine guns, more than twenty rifles, and two pistols. The Seventh Platoon followed the Fifth Platoon to climb the village. Wang Dechang, a sharpshooter of the platoon, used leggings to pull up dozens of comrades under enemy artillery fire, shortening the time to climb the village. The young heroes Wang Changfa and Wang Dechang were both approved to join the Party, and platoon leader Yang Wanxiang was approved to transfer Party membership.

  　大批战斗英雄入党
    【新华社西北前线十日电】西北人民解放军各部在痛歼胡匪三十六师的战斗中，展开杀敌立功入党、转党、争取当模范党员的运动。某部二大队党委研究出火线入党的具体办法，规定在战场上及时传播胜利消息与战斗中的英雄人物。凡在完成最艰难的战斗任务中表现够党员条件者，即可接受其入党请求，吸收入党。在连续三天的战斗中，某部即吸收了大批立功战士入党、转党，并选出了模范党员。四支三分队在王庄战斗后数小时即补选支委，整顿支部及党员小组。党员马世仁在战斗中机枪托被敌人打掉后，仍沉着地握着枪身继续发射，阻止敌人反扑，被选为模范党员。通讯员周道地、张志才等被批准入党；三个候补党员被讨论通过转党。支部并追认在战斗中英勇牺牲的李兴忠（候补党员）和曾请求入党的战士符恒祥为正式党员。五班十七岁的战士王昌发冒敌炮火登上寨子，向敌投弹，掩护全班相继攀登而上，迫使五、六十个敌人放下武器，缴重机枪一挺，轻机枪两挺，步枪二十余支，手枪二支；七班尾随五班登寨，该班神枪射手王德昌在敌炮火射击下用绑腿带拉上去几十个战友，缩短了登寨时间。小英雄王昌发和王德昌均被批准吸收入党，班长杨万祥被批准转党。
