To Comrade Chen Zhong of the Beiyue First Special District Commissioner's Office:
    Regarding the two issues of "inconsistent postal rates for official documents and letters from industry and commerce bureaus and other agencies in Yanggao, Datong and other counties" and "failure to receive registered mail receipts on time," they have been forwarded to the Beiyue Postal Bureau for their inspection and resolution.

To Comrades Dian Qilin and Bing of the Beiyue Directly Subordinate Hospital:
    Regarding the slow delivery and backlog of newspapers, according to a letter from the Beiyue Postal Bureau, this is due to the recent continuous rain and flooding rivers, which have hindered postal traffic. Efforts are now being made to improve the situation.

To Cao Litian from Yangquan City:
    Regarding the confiscation of your ironware shop in Xiyang, you can contact the Xiyang County Government for a resolution. We have also sent a letter to them requesting an investigation and handling.

To Wang Jintang from Ren County:
    If the two mu of land you bought from the Jiang family was purchased through the proper rural land transaction procedures, it is wrong for the Jiang family to forcibly demand its return, not only without refunding the land price, but also harvesting your crops. This matter can be resolved by the district or county government.

To Ren Qingjie from Xingtang:
    (1) After you were wrongly criticized, the village decided to return the house to you, but Zhang Luodeng is occupying your five rooms and refuses to return them. You can ask the village to resolve this. (2) Regarding the divorce between Liu Meiying and your mute son, consideration should be given to whether the woman married voluntarily or by family arrangement. What was the relationship like after the marriage, and is reconciliation possible? Forced matchmaking will not lead to happiness.

　　信箱北岳一专署陈中同志：
    关于“阳高大同等县邮局对工商局与其他机关公文信件邮资不统一”与“挂号信件之回执不能按时收到”两个问题，已转寄北岳邮政局，请他们检查解决。北岳直属医院殿琪林冰同志：
    关于报纸邮寄迟慢与积压现象，据北岳邮局来函，是因近来阴雨连绵河水暴涨，邮政交通受到障碍所致，现已力求改进。阳泉市曹立田君：
    你在昔阳开设的铁器铺，被没收的问题，可到昔阳县府接洽解决，同时我们也去信请他们调查处理。任县王金堂君：  　你所买姜姓的二亩地，如果是按照农村买卖土地的正当手续所买的，姜姓强行索回，不但不退出地价，反而又收了你的庄稼这更是不对的，此事可请区县政府解决。行唐任清姐君：
    （一）你被错斗后，村里又决定把房子退给你，而张洛登占着你五间房子不退，可请村里解决。（二）关于刘美英与你哑吧儿子离婚问题，应考虑当年结婚时，是女方自愿呢，还是家庭主婚？结婚后感情如何，是否有和解可能。强制撮合是不会美满的。
