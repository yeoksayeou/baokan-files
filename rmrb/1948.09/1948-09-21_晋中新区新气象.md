　　New Atmosphere in the Jinzhong New District
　　I. The Taiyuan-Fenyang Highway is Revived
　　The Taiyuan-Fenyang Highway, which was lifeless under the rule of the Yan bandit gang, has been revived with the liberation of Jinzhong. In the past, there were few pedestrians on this road, because anyone who walked on it would be interrogated and harassed by the Yan bandits, and even be labeled as "collaborating with the bandits" and lose their lives. Now that the people are liberated, the road is also liberated. Every day, people, horses, and vehicles come and go in an endless stream, and the number of small vendors along the road has surged. In the section from Fenyang to Wenshui alone, there are more than 70 households. The common people say: "In the past, the Taiyuan-Fenyang Road belonged to Yan Xishan, but now it belongs to us, the common people."
　　II. Grand Temple Fair Held in Xiaoyi City
　　On July 23rd, Xiaoyi City held its first temple fair since liberation. The number of attendees reached 50,000 to 60,000, including 346 merchants from as far away as Beiping, Tianjin, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Suiyuan, as well as 440 mules and horses, and countless small vendors. The bustling situation was the first of its kind in ten years. Under the rule of the Yan bandits, Xiaoyi City had no contact with other places and was lifeless. After liberation, it became accessible in just two or three months, with merchants coming and going, making it prosperous and lively.
　　III. Taigu Democratic Government Protects Industry and Commerce
　　When the Taigu County government took over the Yan puppet public-run stores, it first conducted a preliminary investigation. At that time, it was found that there were 17 stores in the city with Yan bandit signboards. After further investigation, it was found that only seven stores, such as "Preparation Warehouse" and "Pingzhi Association," were public-run stores of the Yan bandits. The other ten stores, although bearing Yan bandit signboards, were actually privately funded. For example, the pseudo-prefecture commissioner's mill was jointly established by pseudo-county government staff, and the "Tax Goods Cooperative" and "Cultural Service Center" and other commercial firms hung up public signboards out of fear of "preferential grain" and "standing soldiers" under the rule of the Yan bandits. The democratic government did not touch any of the private funds of the above two types of stores. If there were Yan bandit official funds, it only took over the Yan bandit official part and allowed them to continue operating. Mr. Wu Huaning, the owner of Guang Shengyu, said: "Now we can do business. The democratic government protects private funds and allows us to operate freely."
　　IV. Fenyang City Establishes a People's Hospital
　　Fenyang City suffers from serious diseases and disasters. The democratic city government cares about the people's suffering and established a people's hospital at the former site of the Yan bandit health院. Most of the staff in the hospital are newly liberated doctors and nurses. They deeply feel the leniency and preferential treatment of our Party towards them and are working actively.

　　晋中新区新气象
  　一、太汾公路复活了
    在阎匪统治下死气沉沉的太（原）汾（阳）公路，随着晋中的解放也复活了。过去这条路很少行人，因为谁要在路上走，就要受到阎匪们的盘问留难，甚至给戴上“通匪”帽子丧了性命。现在人民解放了，路也解放了，每日路上人马车辆络绎不绝，路旁小摊贩激增。仅汾阳到文水一段，即达七十余家。老百姓说：“过去太汾路是阎锡山的，现在成了咱们老百姓的了”。
    二、孝义城举行大庙会
    七月二十三日孝义城举行解放后的第一次庙会，赶会者达五、六万人，内有北平、天津、陕西、宁夏、绥远等地远来的商人三四六家，到会骡马四四零头，大小摊贩无数，其热闹情况为十年来第一次。阎匪统治时，孝义城与各地不通往来，死气沉沉，解放后只两三个月就四通八达，商贩往来，繁荣热闹了。
    三、太谷民主政府保护工商业
    太谷县政府在接收阎伪公营商店时，首先进行了初步调查。当时查出城内挂阎匪牌号的商店共有十七家，后经深入了解，发现只有“准备库”“平执会”等七家是阎匪的公营商店，另外十家虽挂着阎匪牌号，实际上是私人股金，如伪专署磨房即以伪县府职员合股开办，“税务货物合作社”与“文化服务处”等商号，是因在阎匪统治下怕出“优待粮”“常备兵”而挂起了公家牌号。民主政府对以上两种商号，私人资金一概不动，如有阎匪官方资金，也只接收阎匪官方那一部分，并让其继续营业。广升裕老板吴华宁先生说：“现在可以作买卖了，民主政府保护私人资金，能自由营业。”
    四、汾阳市成立民众医院
    汾阳市病灾严重，民主市府关怀人民痛苦，在阎匪卫生院旧址成立一民众医院，院内工作人员大部是新解放之医生护士，他们深深的感到我党对他们的宽大和优待，都在积极的工作。
