　　【Taihang Electric】The Bo'ai Eighth District militia and rotation team fought valiantly, crushing the "mopping-up" operation of an enemy four times their size. On the 6th of this month, the 12th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's Hebei-Baoding Garrison, colluding with the local armed forces of the bandit Wang Delin's unit, more than 800 men in total, carrying 24 light and heavy machine guns and three mortars and small cannons, launched an all-out attack on our Eighth District in several directions, attempting to destroy the local people's armed forces and plunder grain and conscript soldiers. When the enemy came down from Nan Si Ling, they stepped on two landmines, wounding two men. When the enemy was busy tending to the wounded, our Ma Jie Gou militia and rotation team fired fiercely, covering the masses' evacuation from the village. When the enemy attacked us in three directions, the village militia and rotation team did not fire a shot, but quickly moved to the rear to set an ambush. When the enemy entered the ambush circle, we immediately fired with machine guns, rifles, and grenades, repelling the enemy. The enemy charged a second time, and the quick-witted militia and rotation team fought while retreating, then withdrew to both sides, luring the enemy deep. When the enemy reached Yang Quan, the three-way joint defense militia of the east, west, and center quickly concentrated and charged the Chiang bandits, covering the troops and killing or wounding eight enemies. The enemy fled in panic. On the way, a part of our rotation team intercepted them, killing or wounding more than 20 enemies. When the enemy fled to Ma Jie Gou and Long Dong, they again stepped on landmines, killing or wounding 10 men. The other two groups of enemies attacking the Eastern Joint Defense advanced to Zhong Wei Village, where the militia and another detachment concentrated their fire to block the enemy, continuously repelling 12 enemy assaults, covering the masses' evacuation. At the same time, they laid landmines and ambushed the enemy behind the village; when the enemy entered the village to loot grain, a soldier was killed by a landmine as soon as he pushed open a door. The village cadres led the militia to charge from the side, scattering the enemy. Running into the street, they stepped on another landmine, wounding one man. This forced the bandits to flee back along the mountain road. At this time, our 18th Detachment and two groups of militia joined forces to pursue the enemy, chasing them all the way to Twelve Association Ridge, wounding seven enemies and intercepting a portion of the grain. In total, in this battle lasting two hours, 17 enemies including the enemy company commander Gao Mingyi were killed, 31 enemies were wounded, one enemy was captured, and two rifles, more than 600 rounds of ammunition, and 13 grenades were seized. We only had two men wounded. The Fourth Special Prefecture, the Fourth Military Sub-district Command, and the Armed Forces Committee jointly issued a circular of commendation and awarded a bonus of 150,000 yuan.
