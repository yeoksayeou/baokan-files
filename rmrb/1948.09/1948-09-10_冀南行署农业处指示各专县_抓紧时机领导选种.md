Jinnan Administrative Office Agricultural Department Instructs Each Special County to Seize the Opportunity to Lead Seed Selection

[Jinnan Electric] The Agricultural Department of the Jinnan Administrative Office instructed each special and county to actively lead the masses in seed selection during the autumn harvest season. It pointed out that selecting superior varieties is one of the concrete methods to improve agricultural production. As the saying goes, "A strong mother produces a fat son," which is a very practical and scientific principle. The Yulinbai wheat from the Shifosi area of ​​Linqing, as proven over the years, yields 20 to 30 jin more per mu than ordinary wheat, regardless of where it is planted. If seeds are not selected and the seeds are mixed, the crops in a field will not mature at the same time. Harvesting according to the early-maturing ones will inevitably result in low yields, and harvesting according to the late-maturing ones will definitely suffer losses. For example, one family in Shichangtun, Linqing, had very mixed wheat seeds and uneven maturity, resulting in reduced wheat yield. Uneven maturity will also affect the entire field's ability to catch up with the planting schedule.

How to select seeds and promote them? (1) Select and promote locally. Any superior variety recognized by the local masses should be selected and then promoted to the masses. Introduce the advantages of this variety, planting methods, and management techniques. This is easy for the masses to become familiar with and master, and the masses are also more likely to accept it. (2) Before selecting seeds, you should go to the field to observe in detail to see which seeds are good. After selecting the seeds, they should be harvested, threshed, and stored separately to maintain the purity of the seeds. What are superior varieties? The following are introduced for reference: (1) Millet: The grains are moderate in size, the color is uniform, the grains are round and thick-skinned, the ears are heavy, the grains are small, the ears are dense, the awns are stiff and long, the stalks are upright, there are many tillers, and there are no diseases such as "empty grains," "black mold," "exposed heart," or "burnt heart." According to the results of experiments conducted at the Linqing Farm last year, "811" millet yielded 15 jin more per mu than the locally recognized best "Goose Feather White" millet under the same cultivation conditions, and yielded half a jin more rice per hundred jin of millet. The same results were obtained in the trial planting at the Yulin Farm. This proves that "811" millet is suitable for the soil and climate of Jinnan and should be continuously promoted. (2) Cotton: The plants are strong, the fruit branches are long, the cotton bolls are numerous and large, the cotton opens early, the lint is clean and white, the fiber is fine and long, and it has luster. "S-character cotton" is a new foreign variety, and the yield is very good according to the Linqing Farm's experiment. (3) Corn (maize): The grains are plump, the color is uniform, the skin is thick, the ears are long, the cob (ear axis) is thin, there are no insects in the cob, the head and tail are about the same thickness, the grains are full at the ear end, the whole ear has seventeen or eighteen rows of grains, the rows are straight, the grains are arranged neatly, there is no black mold disease, and it matures early. (4) Sorghum: The stalks are thick and long, upright, the ears are heavy, the grains are large, the outer shell cap is small, and it does not grow red spores or black mold. (5) Drought-resistant and famine-preparedness seeds: This year, the region has suffered severe floods, and special attention should be paid to selecting and storing early-maturing and early-harvesting seeds that can enable the masses to have an early harvest next spring and prevent spring drought. For example, "60-day return to granary" small yellow millet, small jade corn, small mung beans, and broomcorn millet are excellent varieties that should be given special attention this year, which is of great significance for drought prevention and famine preparedness.

The specific tasks of each special and county in selecting and promoting superior varieties: The construction sections of each county under the jurisdiction of the First, Second, and Fourth Special Districts should earnestly be responsible for leading the masses to plant "811" millet. And according to the field block selection method, the "811" millet should be harvested and stored separately. The public sector will exchange 11 jin of public grain millet for 10 jin of "811" millet. When selecting "811" millet, the construction sections of each county should inquire in detail about the growth conditions, various characteristics, and the yield comparison with local general millet. It should be reported to the promotion section of this office in Linqing before the end of this month. The construction section of Xiajin and the promotion section of this office should conduct detailed inquiries and research on the "S-character cotton" experimental area in Xiajin and Linqing. In order to maintain the purity of the seeds, the agricultural supply cooperative of this office specially purchases "S-character cotton" in Linqing City and stores the cotton seeds itself. The seed processing in Xiajin is organized and managed by the government to prepare for large-scale promotion next year. Varieties of millet, cotton, corn, sorghum, beans, etc., that are recognized by the masses as good varieties should be selected, stored, and promoted locally; if there are particularly good varieties, the seed households, the masses, or cadres should report to this office. After inspection and visits by this office, if it is indeed a superior variety that needs to be widely promoted, this office will commend and reward it.

　　冀南行署农业处指示各专县
  　抓紧时机领导选种
    【冀南电】冀南行署农业处，指示各专、县抓紧秋收时机积极领导群众选种。指出：选择优良品种是农业生产提高一步的具体办法之一，俗话说：“母壮子肥”这是一个很实际科学的道理。临清石佛寺一带的鱼鳞白小麦，几年来的证明，不论在什么地种，都比一般小麦每亩多收二、三十斤。如果不选种，种子杂乱，一块地里庄稼不能同时熟，要按早熟的收割必然产量小，按晚熟的收割就必定受损失。如临清石长屯有一家麦种非常杂，成熟不齐，结果麦子减收。由于成熟期不齐，也会影响整个地的赶茬。
    怎样进行选种及推广呢？（一）就地选就地推广。凡被当地群众公认的优良品种，经过选择再推广到群众中去。介绍该种的优点，种植方法，以及管理的技术等。这样易为群众熟悉掌握，群众也容易接受。（二）选种时事先应到地里详细观察，看那些种子好，选好后应单独收打和存放，保持种子纯粹。那些为优良品种？现介绍以下几种以供参考采用：（一）谷：籽粒适中，颜色一律，粒圆皮厚，穗头重，码子小，穗密，毛刚毛长，秆直立，分杼多，没有“糠谷老”“乌霉”“露心”“烧心”等病。“八一一”谷，去年在临清农场试验结果，在同样耕作条件下，比当地认为最好的“鹅翎白”谷每亩多产十五斤，每百斤谷多出斤半米。在鱼鳞农场试种，也得到同样结果。证明“八一一”谷适合于冀南土壤气候，应该继续推广。（二）棉花：棵强壮，果枝长、棉桃多而大，吐絮早，絮洁白，绒细长，有光泽。“斯字棉”是外来新品种，经临清农场试验，产量很好。（三）棒子（玉蜀黍）：籽粒饱满，颜色一律，皮厚，穗长，棒轴（穗轴）细，轴心里没虫子，头尾粗细差不多，籽粒长满穗端，全穗籽粒有十七八行，行直籽粒排列整齐，没有乌霉病，成熟早。（四）高粱：杆粗长，直立，穗重，籽粒大，外壳帽小，不长红斐和乌霉。（五）防旱备荒种子，今年本区水灾严重，应该特别注意选存早种早收能使群众明春早接口及防春旱的种子，象六十天还仓的小黄谷、小玉茭、小绿豆、黍子等忧良品种，在今年应特别注意选择，这对防旱备荒有重要意义。
    各专、县选、推优良品种的具体任务：一、二、四专区所辖各县建设科，切实负责领导群众种“八一一”谷。并按田间块选办法，把“八一一”谷单收打和保存。公家用十一斤公粮谷换“八一一”谷十斤。各县建设科在选“八一一”谷时，应详细询明生长情况，各种特点，和当地一般谷的产量比较。务于本月底前呈报临清本处推广科。夏津建设科及本处推广科，对夏津临清“斯字棉”试验区作详细的询问和研究。为了保持种子的纯粹，本处农业供应社特在临清市收买临清“斯字棉”，自己轧存棉种。夏津轧种，由政府组织管理，以备明年大量推广。各地谷、棉、棒子、高粱、豆子等，被群众公认为好品种，应就地选存推广；如有特别好的，由种户及群众或干部向本处报告，经本处检查访问，如确系优良品种需要广泛推广的，本处予以表扬奖励。
