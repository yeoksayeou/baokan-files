　　Xinji Yuhua Public Store Has Planned Support for Production
    [Report from this newspaper] Xinji Yuhua Public Store in Jizhong has clearly implemented the Party's guidelines and policies, and has gradually moved towards planned business operations. In the past six months, it has achieved significant results in stabilizing prices, supporting production, and assisting disaster areas. The store is located in the central part of the 11th District, with eight branches in the surrounding towns. Last year, the 11th District suffered a widespread drought, with the average yield in each county only reaching 50%. Zhao County's autumn grain harvest was only enough to supply the county's population for two months. Based on the above situation, the main store and branches have planned to organize long-distance transportation. By the end of July, a total of 14,999,900+ catties of wheat and 30,080,000+ catties of coarse grains were transported and sold from eastern Jizhong and the Bohai area of Shandong Province, with transportation costs reaching 900 million yuan. Among them, the Xinji market (main store) sold more than 16,000,000 catties of coarse grains; 80% were sold to Zhao, Luan, and other counties with the most severe disasters. The number of handcarts pushing grain in Zhao County increased to more than 700, with about 1,000 people involved. The Ningjin market (6th branch) regularly sold more than half of its grain to Zhao County; adding the 2,070,000+ catties sold by the 7th branch in Zhao County, the grain shortage problem was basically solved. In terms of support for the western mountainous areas, in addition to the main store's bulk transaction of more than 800,000 catties of coarse grains with Shijiazhuang, the Jiucheng market saw an average of 1,400 shi of grain brought in by the masses per market day, of which 50% to 70% were sold to Shijiazhuang and Huolu. The 3rd branch (Jiucheng) sold a total of 6,343,000 catties of miscellaneous grains, all of which were sold to the west. Due to the vigorous organization of transportation, the risk of selling livestock due to livelihood difficulties in disaster areas was resolved, the needs of the market were met, and the rise in prices was suppressed. Except for a brief fluctuation in mid-May, the prices were basically kept stable, allowing the masses in the disaster areas to eat relatively cheap grain. The masses in Zhao County generally reflected: "If it weren't for the public store's grain transfer, the disaster would have been impossible to overcome!" Some said: "Having a cart is like having a guaranteed meal!"
    The store provided raw materials to the masses, solved the sales of finished products, and supported the sideline production of the masses. Taking textiles as an example, the main store and branches sold a total of 595,024 catties of ginned cotton and purchased 310,976 bolts of native cloth in the past six months. Among them, the disaster-stricken Zhao and Luan counties accounted for an estimated 177,706 bolts; calculating a gross profit of 20 catties of millet per bolt, the two counties could obtain 3,554,120 catties of millet. In May, due to the existence of a purely task-oriented view in management, the calculation of weaving profits was once insufficient, and the price increase could not keep up with the rise in grain prices, resulting in a slight decrease in the quality of native cloth. Later, it was stipulated that Grade A cloth should be calculated based on local grain prices and flower prices, and a gross profit standard of 20 to 23 catties of millet should be maintained, ensuring the quality of native cloth, which is improving day by day.
    The store has also made considerable achievements in providing loans for shipbuilding and restoring river transportation. It has provided loans of 60 million yuan to organize 450 boatmen in 18 villages in Gao and Zheng (Ding) counties. Between March and April, 79 flat-bottomed boats were completed, and 31 privately funded shipbuilding projects were initiated. They were launched to load goods, and within half a month, 1,500,000 catties of coal were transported to eastern Jizhong through the Gaocheng 5th branch. The restoration of river transportation not only solved the difficulties of some land-scarce farmers along the river but also saved the public a lot of manpower and animal power. In terms of secondary businesses, a total of 1,490,000+ catties of salt were transported, 460,000+ catties of white oil were sold, and 3,954 catties of well-drilling equipment such as lead wire and palm bark, and 385 pieces of bamboo products were purchased and sold, directly supporting the development of agriculture and supplying the necessities of life for farmers.

　　辛集裕华公营商店有计划的扶植生产
    【本报讯】冀中辛集裕华公营商店，明确贯彻党的方针政策，逐渐走向了有计划的经营业务。半年来，在稳定物价，扶植生产，支援灾区等方面，已获得重大成绩。该店位于十一分区中部，在周围城镇设有八个分店。去年十一分区普遍遭旱，各县平均只五成年景，赵县秋季收粮，仅供全县人口两月之用。根据以上情况，总、分店即有计划的组织远途调运，至七月底，从冀中东部与山东渤海区，共调运和出售小麦一千四百九十九万九千余斤，粗粮三千零八十余万斤，开支运费达九亿元之多。其中辛集市场（总店）即出售粗粮一千六百余万斤；百分之八十销到灾情最重的赵、栾等县，赵县推粮小车增至七百余辆，人数达一千左右；宁晋市场（六分店），经常有半数以上的粮食销往赵县；加上赵县七分店出售的二百零七万多斤，粮荒问题基本上得到解决。对西部山地的支持，除总店与石家庄大宗成交粗粮八十多万斤外，旧城市场每集群众上粮平均一千四百石，其中百分之五十至七十销到石家庄、获鹿一带；三分店（旧城）共出售杂粮六百三十四万三千斤，完全销往西部。由于大力组织了调运，解决了灾区因生活困难而卖牲口的危险，供给了市场的需要，平抑了物价的上涨。除五月中旬一度波动外，基本上保持了物价的稳定，使灾区群众吃到比较便宜的粮食。赵县群众普遍反映：“要不是公家商店的调粮，灾荒可没法过！”有的说：“有辆车，就保住了饭碗！”
    该店供给群众原料，解决成品销路，扶植了群众副业生产。单就纺织说，半年来总分店共售出皮棉五十九万五千零二十四斤，收购土布三十一万零九百七十六匹。其中灾区赵、栾两县，估十七万七千七百零六匹；以每匹得毛利二十斤小米计算，两县即可得小米三百五十五万四千一百廿斤。五月份，由于经营上存在着单纯的任务观点，曾一度对织布利润计算不够，提价赶不上粮价的上升，土布质量有些降低。后来即规定甲等布根据当地粮价和穰花价计算，除去原料外，保持毛利润二十斤至二十三斤小米的标准，保证土布质量，日益提高。
    在贷款造船，恢复河运方面，该店也作出相当成绩。曾贷款六千万元，在藁、正（定）两县的十八个村中，组织四百五十个船户，于三四月间，先后完成平船七十九只，并带起私资造船三十一支，下水装货，半月时间经藁城五分店运往冀中东部煤炭一百五十万斤。由于河运的恢复，不仅解决了沿河两岸一部缺地农民的困难，同时公家也节省不少人力畜力。在次要业务上，共运食盐一百四十九万余斤，出售白油四十六万余斤，购买与出售打井器材铅丝、棕皮三千九百五十四斤，缺竹货三百八十五件，直接扶植了农业的发展和供给了农民生活中的必需品。
