　　波工人党动员中小农民进行反富农斗争
    【新华社陕北十三日电】电通社华沙讯：波兰工人党中央机关报“人民呼声”九日宣布：工人党目前的任务是动员广大的中小农民群众进行反对富农和资本家的斗争，并组织维护乡村工人阶级经济利益的工作。该报继称：这一任务得以成功的条件，为肃清农村党组织内的异己分子和工人阶级的敌人，以及清洗农业行政机关。据波兰社会党中央机关报“工人报”报导，波兰农村中有一种暗中恐吓农民的流言，说农民可能失去波兰革命所给予他们的土地。该报提醒农民说：实业部长明兹已向农民作过保证，组织合作社之后，个体农民不仅不会丧失其为土地主人的资格，反之，由于生产方法的改进和社会事业的进步，农民将得到好处。
