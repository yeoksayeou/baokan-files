Xinhua News Agency, East China, 12th: Under the leadership of the democratic government, the people of Bohai, Lucent South and other places in Shandong Province have actively dredged rivers and built embankments, benefiting two million mu of farmland. The Bohai area has completed the dredging projects of seven rivers, including the Shibei River, the Fu River, the Tuhai River, the Xiaofu River, the Xuanhui River, the Qundai River, and the Mi River. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 132,000 laborers were used, and more than 4.477 million cubic meters of earth were excavated. The Shibei River originates in Nanpi, Hebei Province, passes through Cangxian and Huanghua (renamed from Xinhua), and enters the sea through Qikou. There are 72 depressions on both sides of the river, all of which rely on the river for drainage to avoid disasters. However, due to years of disrepair, several sections of the riverbed have been silted up. The Great Wave Depression and Caijia Kiln and other places have accumulated water for as long as 18 years. Most of the land in northern Huanghua was occupied by the river, and the local people could not cultivate the land, but only made a living by fishing, drying salt, cutting reeds, and selling grass. The Fu River originates from the Grand Canal south of Cangzhou City, passes through Cangxian and Jinan (newly established county, parts of Huanghua and Qingxian), and also enters the sea through Qikou. Due to disrepair of the river course, coupled with repeated destruction by the Kuomintang army, dangers have occurred frequently. The upper reaches of the river, including the Zhang and Wei rivers, have been dredged by the Hebei-Luyu Democratic Government, and the water flow has accelerated. If the Fu River downstream is not repaired, it will cause serious floods. Therefore, the democratic governments of Huanghua, Jinan, Jingyuan (formerly Yanshan), Nanpi, and Cangxian mobilized more than 64,000 laborers in April this year to start dredging, which was completed by the end of June, and a new river channel of more than 16 kilometers was newly excavated, and a new sluice gate was built at the junction of the two rivers. In this way, more than 5,000 mu of land in the above-mentioned 72 depressions were freed from water disasters, and the accumulated water along the river for 18 years was also dredged. The reed marsh of more than 800 square li in the suburbs of Huanghua can increase the production of reeds by one time. If water conservancy is further developed, 3,000 square li of land east of Xiasanpu in Jinan and west of Qikou can be irrigated by the Shibei River and turned into paddy fields; ships on both rivers can also navigate inland and sell fish and salt along the coast. The Tuhai River, which flows through Shanghe, Bin County, and Zhanhua, has been dredged for more than 200 kilometers. The Xiaofu River in Huantai, the Xuanhui River in Jingyuan, the Mi River in Shouguang, and the Qundai River in Boxing have all been dredged and embanked. After the Mi River and Qundai River were repaired and dredged, 230,000 mu of land benefited.
    Weian (newly established county, northeast of Anqiu), Yishui North, Yishui South and other counties in Lucent South have dredged and opened the Honggou, which has been silted up for 70 years, and built the dam on the Mazhan River and opened canals, with a total length of 98 li, protecting a total of more than 300,000 mu of land, with a total of more than 226,000 laborers. The government provided a total of 5.5 million yuan in North Sea currency and 400,000 jin of grain for work accounts.
    Gaomi County in Binbei repaired the Wulong River, using more than 115,000 laborers. Now the river is straight and the river is surging. After the river was repaired, 60,000 mu of good land was rescued, and 6 million jin of grain can be increased annually.

　　山东人民积极治河修筑堤坝
  　受益田地达二百万亩
    【新华社华东十二日电】渤海、鲁中南等地人民在民主政府领导下，积极疏浚河流，修筑堤坝，受益田地达二百万亩。渤海区先后完成石碑河、滏河、徒骇河、孝妇河、宣惠河、群带河、弥河等七条河流疏导工程。据不完全统计，共用民工十三万二千余人，挖土四百四十七万七千余方。石碑河发源于河北省之南皮，经沧县、黄骅（新海改名）由歧口入海。两岸有洼地七十二处，均靠该河排水，始能免灾，但因年久失修，河床数段淤平，大浪淀、蔡家窑等地竟有积水达十八年者。黄骅北部大半土地被该河水侵占，当地群众无法耕作，惟以捕鱼、晒盐、割苇、卖草为生。滏河发源于沧州城南之运河，经沧县、津南（新设县，黄骅、青县各一部），亦由歧口入海。河道失修，又加国民党军多次破坏，曾不断出险；而该河之运河上游及其支流漳、卫两河，均经冀鲁豫民主政府修浚，水流加急，下游之滏河不修，必将造成严重水灾。因此，黄骅、津南、靖远（原盐山）、南皮、沧县等六县民主政府于今年四月动员民工六万四千余人，开始疏浚，于六月底大功告成，并新挖河道十六余公里，在两河相接处新修水闸一座。这样就使上述七十二洼地五千余亩土地免除了水患，沿河十八年积水亦获疏浚。黄骅城郊八百余方里的苇洼可增产苇子一倍。如进一步建设水利，则津南下三铺以东、歧口以西三千方里土地可得石碑河之灌溉而变为稻田；两河船只亦可通航内地，畅销沿海鱼盐。流经商河、滨县、沾化等地的徒骇河疏浚了二百余公里。桓台孝妇河、靖远宣惠河、寿光弥河、博兴群带河等均进行了疏浚与筑堤。弥河及群带河修浚后，受益土地达二十三万亩。
    鲁中潍安（新设县，安邱东北）、沂（水）北、沂（水）南等县，疏浚开凿已淤塞了七十年的洪沟，修筑了马站河上的大堤及开渠等共长九十八里，保护了总共三十余万亩的田地，计共用工二十二万六千多个。政府共贷北海币五百五十万元，发工帐粮四十万斤。
    滨北高密县修治五龙河，用工十一万五千多个。现该河河身笔直，河水浩荡奔流。修河以后，救出良田六万亩，年可增产六百万斤粮食。
