Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Reports from various sources indicate that the French Marie cabinet, established just a month ago, collapsed on the 28th. Marie resigned after insurmountable disagreements arose during a cabinet meeting to draft and implement the Reynaud financial and economic program. According to Agence France-Presse, "the point of contention in the cabinet meeting was the issue of wage increases; Finance Minister Reynaud was prepared to agree to a 10 percent increase, while the Socialists insisted on a 15 to 16 percent increase." However, as Agence France-Presse stated, "it must be emphasized that there was no fundamental difference in the views of Reynaud and Blum (leader of the Socialist Party)." In fact, the Socialist Party was an enthusiastic accomplice of Marie while the Marie cabinet was vigorously pursuing its "Reynaud Plan" and raising prices. Only when these reactionary policies had aroused widespread dissatisfaction and anger among the French people did they "force the 'Workers' Force' faction of the trade union, initiated by the Socialist Party, to align with the General Confederation of Labor on the wage issue" (Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th). At the same time, with municipal elections about to be held, the Socialist Party, wearing the mask of "defender of the people," had to make some "politically necessary gestures before the election" (ibid.). Therefore, the French Communist Party's organ, "L'Humanité," pointed out: "The downfall of Blum, Reynaud, Marie, and Schuman is the result of popular discontent. Their high-price policies, their demands for anti-democratic privileges, and their policies of preparing for war have aroused the anger of the entire French people" (TASS, Paris, 28th). The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communiqué stating: "The current cabinet crisis proves that a government without the participation of workers and against the working class is incapable of managing state affairs." The communiqué firmly advocated "organizing a broad democratic coalition government that will implement a genuine patriotic policy, protect industry, prevent worker unemployment, and reduce the cost of living by reducing the scandalous profits of capitalists, while adjusting wages and stipulating a minimum essential wage of 12,900 francs per month" (Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th). The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a communiqué on the night of the 28th, calling on all workers to strengthen unity and action in order to establish "a democratic coalition government" in France (ibid.).

　　没工人参加的政府是无能的
  　法国马利内阁短命成立刚一月就倒台
    【新华社陕北二日电】各方报导：成立刚刚才一个月的法国马利内阁，已在二十八日倒台。马利是在内阁草拟实施雷诺财政与经济纲领的会议上发生了没有办法克服的分歧以后提出辞职的。据法新社报导，内阁会议的“争执之点是增加薪资问题，财长雷诺准备同意增加百分之十，而社会党则坚持要增加百分之十五到十六”。但是，如法新社所说，“必须强调指出，雷诺和勃鲁姆（社会党头子）的观点，并没有基本上的不同”。事实上，在马利内阁大搞其“雷诺计划”和抬高物价政策时，社会党正是马利的一名热心的帮凶。只是在这些反动政策已引起法国人民的普遍不满和愤怒的时候，才“迫使社会党所发起的‘工人力量’派工会，在工资问题上同总工会一致”（电通社巴黎二十九日电）。同时在这市选行将举行的时候，带上“人民保卫者”假面具的社会党也不得不作些“在选举前的政治上所必要的表示”（同上）。所以法共机关报“人道报”指出：“勃鲁姆、雷诺、马利和舒曼倒台是人民不满的结果。他们的物价高涨政策，他们要求反民主特权和准备战争的政策，已引起全法国人民的愤怒”（塔斯社巴黎二十八日电）。法国总工会执行局发表公报说：“目前的内阁危机证明了，没有工人参加并且反对工人阶级的政府，是不可能管理国事的。”公报坚决主张“组织一个广泛的民主联合政府，这一政府将执行一种真正的爱国政策，保护工业，不使工人失业，同时以减少资本家的可耻的利润来降低生活费，并调整工资，规定必不可少的工资为每月一万二千九百法郎。”（法新社巴黎二十八日电）法共政治局二十八日夜发表公报，号召一切工人加强团结与行动，以便使法国成立“一个民主的联合政府”（同上）。
