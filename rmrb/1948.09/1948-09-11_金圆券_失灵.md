　　"Gold Yuan" Fails
    Since the Kuomintang reactionaries announced the "currency system reform," they have told a lot of myths about the omnipotence of the "Gold Yuan," such as "full reserves," "containing 0.22217 centimeters of pure gold," and "firmly believing that the price level will gradually return to pre-war levels," and so on. But despite all the hype, prices have generally risen. From the issuance of the fake Gold Yuan to the present, the most urgent "emergency economic measures" of the Kuomintang reactionaries have been to use economic police and secret agents to indiscriminately arrest merchants and vendors who "do not comply with price limits" and send them to special criminal courts. They call this method "gagging." They dig a dike themselves, but fire at the raging flood, saying, "Don't flow!" The people are suffering, but the water still has to flow. This kind of pretending to be foolish madness is not the first time for the Kuomintang reactionaries. As early as January 15, 1943, they had already implemented a set of forced price limits, announcing that "those who violate the price limit policy, both buyers and sellers, will be punished according to military law," and after the orders and talks, they arrested people everywhere. But what was the result? Price limits were transformed into negotiated prices, then into self-negotiated prices for various industries, "evaluating and raising, evaluating and raising," the more limited, the more fierce the rise. Before long, the so-called price limits disappeared and completely went bankrupt, and prices continued to rise. Five and a half years later, the Kuomintang reactionaries' plunder of the people and destruction of production have become even more ferocious, and the amount of their income falling short of expenditure, that is, relying on inflation, has become even greater. The "Gold Yuan" and "emergency economic measures" began to go bankrupt as soon as they appeared. In this way, the Kuomintang's "Gold Yuan," on the one hand, is a severe robbery of the people, and on the other hand, it also shows that the reactionaries' road has come to an end. What other way out do they have besides the final collapse? (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th)

### “金圆券”失灵

　　“金圆券”失灵
    国民党反动派宣布“改革币制”以来，讲了一大堆“金圆券”万能的神话，诸如“十足准备”呀，“含纯金零点二二二一七公分”呀，“深信物价水平当逐渐回复到战前水准”呀，等等。但是尽管讲得天花乱坠，物价依然普遍上涨。从伪金圆券发行到现在，国民党反动派最紧急的“紧急财经措施”，就是用经济警察和特务四出滥捕“不遵限价”的商人小贩，送入特种刑庭。他们把这套办法叫做“堵口”。自己把一座堤挖开了，却对着汹涌的洪流开炮，说：“不许流！”人民是遭殃了，但是水却还是要流。这种装作愚蠢的疯狂在国民党反动派并不是第一次。早在一九四三年一月十五日他们就曾经来过一套强迫限价，宣布“凡违反限价政策者，买卖两方，均按军法惩处”，并且在命令、谈话之后，到处捕人。然而结果怎么样？限价一变而为议价，再变而为各业自行议价，“评评涨涨评评涨”，越限就涨得越凶，于是不多一会儿，所谓限价也者，就消声匿迹，全部破产，物价依然涨个不休。时隔五年半，国民党反动派对人民的搜刮即对生产的破坏更凶了，其收入不敷支出的数目即仰赖于通货膨胀的数目更大了，“金圆券”和“紧急财经措施”一出现便开始破产。这样，国民党的“金圆券”从一方面说，是对于人民一次狠狠的大抢劫，从另一方面说，这也表示了反动派的路已经走到尽头。除了最后的大崩溃以外，他们还能有什么旁的出路呢。（新华社陕北八日电）
