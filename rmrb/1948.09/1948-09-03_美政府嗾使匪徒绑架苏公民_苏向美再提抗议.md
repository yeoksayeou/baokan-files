Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. TASS reports: Since Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov protested on the 11th against the US intelligence agencies' connivance with White Russian bandits to illegally kidnap Soviet citizens, the US government has not only refused to notify the Soviet embassy of the whereabouts of the kidnapped Soviet citizen Samarin and his family, but has instead issued summons and hostile threats of punishment against Korsenkina, who was rescued by the Soviet Consul General in New York after escaping danger, completely denying the Soviet consulate's legitimate right to protect its citizens' freedom and human rights. Korsenkina, after being kidnapped and tortured by White bandits for a week, and then subjected to various threats from American reactionaries after escaping danger, suffered a nervous breakdown and jumped from the Soviet consulate in New York on the afternoon of the 12th. At that time, the US police violated diplomatic conventions, rushed into the Soviet consulate in New York, and abducted the injured Korsenkina, refusing Soviet personnel to visit her. Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, lodged another protest with the US government on the 14th for this reason. In its reply on the 19th, the US government not only unreasonably rejected the Soviet ambassador's protest, but also used the blatant slander that Soviet Consul General in New York, Lomakin, had "detained Korsenkina" and "violated the duties of diplomatic officials" as an excuse to demand that Lomakin leave the United States. On the 24th, the Soviet Embassy in the United States, on behalf of the Soviet government, sent a formal note to the US government, which, in addition to refuting the US reply's sophistry and unreasonable condemnation point by point, announced the Soviet government's decision as follows: (1) The Soviet government has decided to immediately close its consulates in New York and San Francisco, because they can no longer perform their duties normally; (2) Based on the principle of reciprocity between the Soviet Union and the United States, the Soviet government believes that the US consulate in Vladivostok should be closed immediately, and the Soviet government's understanding with the US government regarding the opening of a US consulate in Leningrad should also be invalidated.

Furthermore, the Truth Daily on the 22nd, in commenting on the US government's instigation of White Russian bandits to kidnap Soviet citizens and fabricate their names to publish anti-Soviet slanders, strongly condemned the unparalleled provocations of the American intelligence agencies against Soviet citizens, and pointed out that this was an attempt by American reactionaries to cover up the failure of their foreign policy. The American Workers' Daily pointed out: The kidnapping case of Soviet citizens is related to the "secret plan" of the United States to oppose the progressive forces of the world. The newspaper also stated that this is a shocking revelation of the American conspiracy to undermine Soviet-American peace. However, it would be madness if these conspirators thought that humanity would choose crisis and death and abandon the future of liberation.

　　美政府嗾使匪徒绑架苏公民
  　苏向美再提抗议
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社讯：自苏联外长莫洛托夫于十一日抗议美国情报机关纵容白党匪徒非法绑架苏联公民后，美国政府不但拒绝将被绑架的苏联公民萨马林及其家属下落通知苏大使馆，反而对被苏联驻纽约总领事营救脱险的柯森金娜发出传讯和惩罚的敌意威胁，完全否认苏联领事馆保护其公民自由及人权的合法权利。柯森金娜由于被白匪绑架，折磨一周之久，脱险后又遭受美国反动派的各种威胁，因此神经错乱，于十二日下午在纽约苏领事馆跳楼。当时，美国警察即破坏外交惯例，冲入纽约苏领事馆，将受伤的柯森金娜劫持而去，并拒绝苏联人员探视柯氏。苏联驻美大使潘友新十四日为此曾再次向美政府提出抗议。美政府十九日在其复文中不但无理拒绝苏大使的抗议，反以苏驻纽约总领事罗马金“拘禁柯森金娜”、“违反外交官员职权”等横蛮污蔑为借口，要求罗氏离开美国。苏联驻美大使馆乃于廿四日代表苏联政府，向美政府致送正式照会，其中除逐一驳斥美国复文中的强辩与无理谴责外，宣布苏联政府的决定如下：（一）苏联在美国纽约与旧金山两地的领事馆决定立即关闭，因为他们已不能正常地执行其职务；（二）根据苏美双方互惠的原则，苏政府认为美国在海参威的领事馆应即关闭，苏政府与美政府关于美国在列宁格勒开设领事馆的谅解亦应失效。
    又讯：真理报二十二日在评论美政府嗾使白党匪徒绑架苏联公民并捏造他们的名字发表反苏诽谤一事时，痛斥美国特务机关对苏联公民无与伦比的挑衅，并指出这是美国反动派以此来掩盖其外交政策失败的企图。美国工人日报指出：苏联公民的被绑案与美国反对全世界进步势力的“秘密计划”有关。该报又称，这是美国阴谋破坏苏美和平的惊人透露。但是，如果这些阴谋家以为人类将选择危机与死亡而放弃解放的前途，那将是疯狂的。
