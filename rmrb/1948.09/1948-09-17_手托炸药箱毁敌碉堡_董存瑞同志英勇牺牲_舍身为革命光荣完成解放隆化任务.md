Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: Comrade Dong Cunrui, squad leader of the Sixth Squad of a certain unit of the Jicha-Rehe-Liao Liberation Army, sacrificed his life to destroy a strong enemy bunker, playing a significant role in the battle to liberate Longhua City in Western Rehe at a crucial moment. On May 26th, during the Longhua battle, as our army approached the core fortifications of the Kuomintang city, the enemy's group of hidden and exposed bunkers in the northeast corner, and a bridge-like bunker built over a shallow trench, blocked our army's advance. They fired a crossfire network, making it difficult for our army to approach. Two demolition teams were sent up continuously but failed to complete their mission. If this bridge-like fortress could not be destroyed, the battle could not move forward, and it would be impossible to finally annihilate the enemy concentrated in the core fortifications. At this time, Communist Party member Comrade Dong Cunrui, disregarding the fatigue from completing the previous two demolition tasks and the platoon leader's dissuasion, resolutely requested to continue to take on the task of destroying this bridge-like fortress. After receiving permission, he wiped his sweat, picked up the dynamite box, and rushed to the enemy fortress. However, at the time, there was nothing else to support the explosives in the middle of the fortress, and placing them below would not destroy it. Comrade Dong Cunrui then displayed the high spirit of self-sacrifice of the proletariat, without hesitation, holding the dynamite box with one hand and pulling the fuse with the other. In a deafening roar, the fortress was destroyed, and our excellent Communist Party member Comrade Dong Cunrui also gloriously sacrificed himself, becoming immortal. This heroic feat inspired the entire troop to intensify their fire of hatred against the enemy. The assault team immediately followed his bloody trail, rushed into the enemy's formation through the thick smoke, and finally occupied the enemy's core fortifications, capturing more than 130 enemies on the spot, seizing more than ten machine guns and submachine guns. The remaining enemies who broke through and fled were also completely annihilated by another part of our army, gloriously completing the task of occupying Longhua City, an important stronghold outside Chengde.
    Comrade Dong Cunrui was from Nanshanbao Village, Huairou County, Chahar Province. He was twenty years old. Born into a poor peasant family. He joined the army in February 1945 and joined the Chinese Communist Party a year later. He had been credited with three major merits in the battles of Dushikou, Fuxintun, and Nanwanzi. He usually worked hard to train soldiers. In two grenade throwing and shooting practices, he was the first in the whole company, and he also worked hard to learn about explosives. He was also good at uniting soldiers and the masses. Before attacking Longhua, when the unit passed through Toudaogou Village, two women complained to our army about the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang who had killed their husbands, leaving their weak wives and orphaned children unable to survive. At that time, Comrade Dong was filled with righteous indignation and swore: "We must avenge the people of Rehe at any cost!" On the eve of the battle, he requested to be the first to carry out the demolition at the soldiers' meeting and finally fulfilled his heroic oath in this battle.
    Regarding the sacrifice of Comrade Dong Cunrui, Cheng Zihua, Commander of the Jicha-Rehe-Liao Military Region, specially wrote an article of condolence a few days ago and called on the entire army to carry forward his great heroic spirit, strive to improve tactical skills, and strive for greater victories.

　　手托炸药箱毁敌碉堡
  　董存瑞同志英勇牺牲
    舍身为革命光荣完成解放隆化任务
    【新华社东北十三日电】迟到：冀察热辽解放军某部六班班长董存瑞同志，牺牲自己的生命，只身摧毁敌军坚强碉堡，对解放热西隆化城的战斗，在重要关键起了重大作用。五月廿六日隆化战斗中，当我军逼近国民党城内核心工事时，敌人在东北角的明暗地堡群和一个架在浅沟上的桥状碉堡，阻住了我军的进路；并发射交叉火网，使我军接近困难，当时曾连续上去了两个爆炸组都没有完成任务。如不能炸毁这座桥状堡垒，战斗就不能再向前发展，就无法最后歼灭集中在核心工事里的敌人。这时共产党员董存瑞同志，不顾刚才因完成其他两次爆破任务的疲劳和连长的劝阻，坚决要求继续担任炸毁这一桥状堡垒的任务。他得到允许后，抹了抹汗，就抱起炸药箱子冲到敌堡垒跟前，但当时没有别的东西可以把炸药支在堡垒中间，而放在堡垒下面，则又炸毁不了它。董存瑞同志于是发挥了无产阶级的高度自我牺牲精神，毫无犹豫的一手托住炸药箱，一手拉开导火线，在震天的一声轰响中，堡垒被炸毁了，而我们优秀的共产党员董存瑞同志也永垂不朽地光荣牺牲了。这一英勇壮举，激动了全体指战员的杀敌烈火，突击队马上踏着他的血迹，随着浓烟冲进敌阵，终于占领了敌人的核心工事，当场俘敌一百三十余名，缴获机枪冲锋枪各十余挺，突围逃窜的残敌，也经另部我军全数歼灭，光荣地完成了占领承德外围重要据点隆化城的任务。
    董存瑞同志是察哈尔省怀柔县南山堡人。现年二十岁。出身于贫农家庭。一九四五年二月参军，一年后加入中国共产党。他先后曾在独石口、复新屯、南湾子诸次战斗中立过大功三次。平时刻若练兵，两次投弹射击都是全连第一名，对学习爆炸也很用功。并善于团结战士和群众。在进攻隆化前，该部途经头道沟村时，曾有两个妇女向我军控诉蒋介石匪帮残杀了她们的丈夫，致使弱妻孤子无法过活的罪行。当时董同志即义愤填胸，宣誓：“不惜任何牺牲，定要为热河人民报仇！”战斗前夜，他在军人大会上要求第一个担任爆炸，终于在这次战斗中，实践了自己的英雄誓言。
    对于董存瑞同志的牺牲，冀察热辽军区程子华司令员特于日前撰文悼念，并号召全军发扬他的伟大英勇精神，努力提高战术技术，以争取更大的胜利。
