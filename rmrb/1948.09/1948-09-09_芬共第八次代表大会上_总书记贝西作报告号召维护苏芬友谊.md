　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: TASS, August 31st: The General Secretary of the Finnish Communist Party, Pessi, recently delivered a report at the Eighth Congress of the Finnish Communist Party. Pessi first pointed out the economic situation in Finland, stating: The working people have achieved significant results in restoring the war-ravaged economy. Finnish industrial production has reached 85 to 90 percent of pre-war levels. The Communist Party fights for the vital needs of the working people, thus preventing price increases. These achievements could have been much greater without the opposition of the Social Democratic Party. Pessi pointed out: The upcoming economic crisis in capitalist countries will inevitably affect the Finnish economy. Therefore, Finland must trade with countries that do not have such crises, namely the Soviet Union and the people's democracies of Eastern Europe. Regarding the political situation in Finland, Pessi stated: In the recent elections, the reactionaries failed to defeat the people's democratic forces, and the Finnish People's Democratic League remains one of the three major parties in parliament. Communists have been excluded from the government because the reactionary bourgeoisie wants to abolish the foreign and domestic policies insisted upon by the Communist Party. Their aim is to purge democratic elements from government agencies, transform Finland into a police state like before the war, and restrict the political rights of workers and ordinary civil liberties. Pessi finally pointed out that the main tasks of the Finnish Communist Party at present are: to maintain the friendship between Finland and the Soviet Union, to ensure unconditional compliance with the peace treaty and the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between Finland and the Soviet Union; to completely eradicate the remnants of fascism, to nationalize the large industries, commerce, banks, and insurance companies controlled by monopoly capital; to implement democratic land reform, and to fight for improving the living standards of the working people.

　　芬共第八次代表大会上
    总书记贝西作报告号召维护苏芬友谊
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社八月三十一日讯：芬兰共产党总书记贝西顷在芬共第八次代表大会上作报告。贝西首先指出芬兰经济情况称：劳动人民在恢复为战争蹂躏的经济方面，获得了重大成绩，芬兰工业生产已达战前水平百分之八十五至九十。共产党为劳动人民的切身需要而奋斗，因而防止了物价的上涨，如果没有社会民主党的反对，这些成就还可以大得多。贝西指出：资本主义国家即将来临的经济危机必将影响芬兰的经济，因此，芬兰必须以没有这种危机的国家，就是苏联与东欧各人民民主国家为贸易对象。论及芬兰的政治形势时，贝西称：在最近的选举中，反动派并没有能打败人民民主力量，而且芬兰人民民主联盟依然是议会三大党之一、共产党人被排斥于政府之外，因为反动的资产阶级想废除共产党所坚持的对外对内政策，他们的目的是想肃清政府机关中的民主分子，变芬兰为战前那样的警察国家，限制工人的政治权利与普通的公民自由权利。贝西最后指出芬共目前的主要任务就是：维护芬苏两国的友谊，确保无条件遵守和约与芬苏友好合作互助条约：完全根绝法西斯残余，将独占资本所控制的大工业、商业、银行与保险公司收归国有；实现民主的土地改革，为提高劳动人民生活水平而斗争。
