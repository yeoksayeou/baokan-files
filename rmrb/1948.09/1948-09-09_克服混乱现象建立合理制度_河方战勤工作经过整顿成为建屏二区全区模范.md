[North Yue News] Hefang Village in Jianping Second District has eighty-five households, with eighty-two men aged eighteen to fifty-five. Excluding five disabled individuals, there are seventy-seven able-bodied laborers. Adding the village's forty-seven donkeys, which equate to forty-seven laborers, and one mule, which equates to two laborers, the village has a total of one hundred and twenty-six laborers. In the past, assigning tasks was quite difficult. Some militiamen would bring up old grievances whenever a task was assigned, and were unwilling to participate. There were even individual militiamen who would frequently feign illness and request leave whenever a task was assigned. When others went out on duty, they would be found working in the fields. Instances even occurred where wartime service committee members couldn't find the squad leader, and squad leaders couldn't find their members. However, these phenomena were not appropriately addressed. Over time, honest and proactive individuals also became reluctant to participate, saying, "We are not afraid of going on duty, but we resent the unfairness. Long duties are still long, and short duties are still short. There is no decision from above, and no rewards or punishments." Obviously, this opinion was very correct, and the wartime service cadres agreed with this statement, but they couldn't find a way to achieve it. Why?

First, the cadres were afraid of offending people and dared not struggle against the phenomenon of shirking duty, and dared not refuse those who feigned illness and asked for leave.

Second, the wartime service department had not established a system. For example, regarding leave, there were no specific regulations regarding who could ask for leave under what circumstances, when to ask, etc. Therefore, mischievous and backward people frequently asked for leave, avoiding arduous, heavy, and long duties. The wartime service department could not calculate short duties, and even if they could, they were not compensated. This created a chaotic situation regarding leave. Secondly, systems such as equal work distribution were also not established.

Third, the wartime service cadres were afraid of trouble, and the work records were unclear. Each time a task was assigned, the wartime service committee member and the wartime service accountant only responsible for assigning the task to each squad and maintaining balance between the squads. However, they did not specifically help the squad leaders maintain a balance of duty among the people. Originally, according to the unified regulations of the county and district, each laborer should carry fifty catties of weight for thirty li (that is, 1,500 catty-li) to be equivalent to one work unit. However, some squad leaders, in order to save trouble or due to limitations in their writing and calculation skills, often did not record catties and li when recording work, only recording that someone had been on duty a certain day. In this way, it was impossible to calculate how many work units were equivalent to one duty performed by someone on a certain day. Therefore, when assigning tasks, even if those performing short duties claimed they had carried for long distances, the wartime service cadres could not expose them.

Fourth, some wartime service cadres lacked a selfless spirit and often prioritized personal relationships. For example, the assignment in April of the previous year was a typical example. The hospital in Zhongshe was moving to Haotian. On the first night, the village received an order from the station to send × stretchers to transport the wounded the next morning. Therefore, the wartime service committee member, in collaboration with the squad leaders, assigned the stretchers overnight and notified each of the militiamen who were to go on duty. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the station sent another order, requesting that more people and livestock be sent to Hongzidian to carry grain, because carrying stretchers was heavy, and carrying grain was light, some wartime service cadres prioritized personal relationships, and withdrew two stretcher bearers who were on good terms with them to carry grain, and replaced them with two other militiamen to carry stretchers. This aroused the opposition of all the militiamen, who all complained about unfairness, and no one was willing to go on duty. The whole morning was a mess, leaving the wartime service cadres at a loss and speechless. Finally, after repeated requests from all the cadres, the militiamen reluctantly went on duty.

As mentioned above, the chaotic situation in the village's wartime service department persisted until it was thoroughly cleaned up in January of last year.

In January of last year, the village's wartime service department underwent a re-election. The masses carefully elected Liu Shu and Liu Tai, whom they supported, as wartime service committee member and accountant. After taking office, they first broke with the concept of favoritism. They said, "If you are afraid of offending people and do not handle public affairs fairly, the masses will be dissatisfied, and you will offend even more people. If you handle public affairs fairly, even if a few bad people are dissatisfied, you are not afraid of offending them." After taking over the work, they never showed any hesitation in the face of difficulties, but actively and proactively solved all the difficulties in the work.

First, they helped the wartime service cadres implement equal work distribution, spending more than ten days sorting out past accounts, posting lists of those who had worked long hours and those who had worked short hours, and explaining that those who had worked long hours would work less in the future, and those who had worked short hours would make up for it. However, for two squads, the accounts were so carelessly recorded on weekdays that they could not be settled. Therefore, with the consent of all the members of the squad, a conclusion was also made. According to estimates, those who had worked long hours would work a little less in the future, and those who had worked short hours would make up for a portion. The specific numbers of reduced and compensated work units were specifically stipulated at the squad meeting. Subsequent work records were then started anew.

Second, various systems were established, starting with the establishment of a leave system. With the consent of the entire village, the wartime service department stipulated that no matter when, anyone, or livestock, if they were sick, they should report to the wartime service department at any time. Wartime service cadres took turns being on duty to register. In this way, during the period when people and livestock were sick, they would not be assigned to duty. If it was their turn to go on duty, the wartime service cadres could skip the names of the sick and assign duties to those further down the list. Here, in order to prevent the phenomenon of shirking duty, it was further stipulated that those with serious illnesses who were bedridden would have their names skipped, and those who had not been on duty would not be compensated for in the future. Those with minor illnesses who could do their own work but could not go on duty would have to make up for it next time they were on duty. This unified regulation won the unanimous support of the entire village, who all said, "Who can live without sickness? Everyone abides by the regulations, no one suffers a loss, and no one gains an advantage." This can not only prevent the phenomenon of individual shirking duty, but also take care of the sick, enabling equal work distribution. Otherwise, before the chronically ill are exempted from duty, they cannot make up for it, making it impossible to equalize work with other militiamen, making it easy for mischievous people to use it as an excuse to shirk duty. Secondly, a system for reporting leave for people and livestock was also stipulated. Those who reported leave would have their names skipped by the wartime service cadres when it was their turn to go on duty, and they would make up for it the next time they were on duty. Those who went out without reporting leave, and had no one to replace them at home, the wartime service cadres had the right to find someone or livestock to go on duty for them, and the wages would be paid by them.

Third, the wartime service accountant controlled the work records and determined a unified and scientific method of recording work. In the past, the work record book was controlled by the squad leaders, and the recording methods were not unified. As mentioned earlier, some recorded the number of trips, some recorded catties but not li, and some recorded li but not catties, making it difficult to equalize work. This time, it was uniformly stipulated that the wartime service accountant would record the work, and the squad leaders' responsibility was only to call people. After the wartime service accountant took control of the record book, he learned from past lessons and never recorded the number of trips. Each work record was clear and transparent.

Secondly, there were also unified regulations on the method of converting work units for substitute cultivation work and trip duties. For example, one work unit was set at ten points (the time before breakfast was set at two points, the time from breakfast to lunch was set at four points, and the time from lunch to dinner was set at four points). These specific regulations strictly limited the phenomenon of mixed work units. In the past, militiamen would cultivate land for military families (allocate temporary workers), and one morning would be equivalent to one work unit, and one afternoon would also be equivalent to one work unit, as well as the phenomenon of going on duty for ten or eight li and being equivalent to one work unit was also eliminated.

The order of assigning duties was also fixed in a certain sequence. Generally, those who had worked shorter hours were assigned duties first, followed by those who had worked longer hours. But when two people had worked the same length of time, they were assigned duties according to the order in the roster. The village's roster was arranged from house to house from the back street to the front street.

Again, a running account method was not adopted when recording work, because the running account method could not equalize work at any time, so it took a lot of time to settle accounts every month. They adopted a method of recording work based on households and based on labor. Each time work was recorded, it was actually equivalent to each time work was equalized.

For example, how much work have militiamen Liang Rugui and Liu Tai each performed? Who should go on duty first next time? You can tell by looking at the account book.

This method of recording work, on the one hand, facilitates the assignment of tasks. At the same time, because a regular calculation system has been established, after a certain period of time, cadres do not need to spend a lot of time settling accounts. However, in order to gather more opinions from the masses and make it more fair, the village still established a regular inspection system, inspecting work units every two or three months, summarizing once a year, and posting lists. Everyone agreed that if individual militiamen did not participate in the work unit inspection or did not look at the posted list, and they raised objections when they were assigned to duty, then all militiamen would have the right to criticize him. At the same time, the squadron, through democratic discussion by all the villagers, stipulated that "it is not allowed to turn over old accounts when assigning duties, and if you have any opinions, turn them over after returning from duty." This decision was made in order not to delay the dispatch of tasks.

After this reorganization, Hefang's wartime service work has become a model for the entire district. Whether it is during the busy farming season or during heavy rain, as long as the order for wartime service comes, the task is immediately assigned, and no noise or shouting is heard. The militiamen always quietly lead their livestock, carrying ropes and cloth bags, to the designated place to assemble. For example, the assignment on the fifteenth day of the sixth lunar month was a typical good example. It was raining heavily that day, and the order came from above to transport ammunition to a certain place. The wartime service cadres braved the heavy rain and immediately assigned the tasks. The militiamen all prepared dry food and stood by for departure. Later, the county sent an order to stop them from leaving.

For more than a year, no cadres have been heard complaining in the village's wartime service department. Automatically meeting at the wartime service department after dinner every day seems to have become their habit. When the masses mention the names of Liu Shu and Liu Tai, everyone praises them, saying, "They handle things fairly." At the same time, the masses also believe that the village's wartime service work can be done well even if it is handed over to other cadres. Because it has laid a good foundation.

From the village's wartime service work, we have come to this experience: as long as the cadres are selfless, actively responsible, there is nothing that cannot be done well in the village.

### 克服混乱现象建立合理制度　河方战勤工作经过整顿成为建屏二区全区模范

　　克服混乱现象建立合理制度
  　河方战勤工作经过整顿成为建屏二区全区模范
    【北岳讯】建屏二区河方全村八十五户，其中有十八岁到五十五岁的男人八十二个，除了五个残疾者以外，能够出差的劳动力七十七个。加上村里四十七头毛驴顶四十七个劳动力，和一头骡子顶两个劳动力；全村共有劳动力一百二十六个。过去，派差相当困难，有的自卫队员一派差就要翻老帐，不愿出差，还有个别的自卫队员，往往一派差，就要告病假，旁人出差了，他又下地做营生，甚至派差时，战勤委员找不着班长，班长找不着队员的事情，也曾发生过。但是，对这些现象，没有适当的处理。久而久之，老实积极的人也不愿出差了，他们说：“我们不怕出差，只嫌不公，长差的尽管长，短差的尽管短，上面没个主张，也没个赏罚。”很显然的，这个意见是很正确的，战勤干部也同意这个说法，只是他们没有办法做到这一条，为什么呢？
    第一、干部害怕惹人，对躲差的现象不敢进行斗争，对装病告假的人又不敢不准。
    第二、战勤部没有建立制度，例如告假问题，什么人在怎样的情形下可以告假？何时告？……等等均无具体的规定。所以，调皮落后的人经常告假，遇苦差、重差、长差不出，短了差战勤部算不出来，即便算出来又不补。这样一来，在告假问题上便形成了混乱的现象。其次，关于齐工等制度，亦未能建立起来。
    第三、战勤干部怕麻烦，工帐不清楚，每次派差，战勤委员和战勤会计，只负责将差派到各班，掌握了班与班之间的出差平衡。但是，却没有具体帮助班长掌握人与人之间的出差平衡。本来，根据县、区统一规定，每个劳动力背五十斤的重量，送三十里路程（即一千五百斤里）顶一个工。但是，有的班长为了省事，或者是由于写算技术的限制，记工的时候往往不记斤、里，只记某天某人出差一趟，这样一来，某天某人出差一趟顶工多少便无从记算了。所以派差的时候，尽管短差的人说自己长送，战勤干部也无法揭露他。
    第四、个别的战勤干部缺乏大公无私的精神，往往要私情，譬如前年四月的一次派差，便是一个典型的例子，中舍的医院要往郝田搬，第一天黑夜，村里接到站上的命令，派担架×付，翌日清晨出发运伤员，于是，战勤委员协同班长连夜派好了担架，分别通知了各个出差的自卫队员。不料，次日清晨站上又来了个命令，要再派人和牲口若干到洪子店驮粮食，因为抬担架差重，驮粮食差轻，个别的战勤干部要了个私情，抽下了两个和自己相好的担架队员去驮粮食，另补了两个自卫队员去抬担架。这一来，便引起了全体自卫队员的反对，谁都嚷着不公，谁也不肯出差了。整整的闹了一个上午，弄得战勤干部束手无策，哑呒言。最后，经过全体干部再三央求，自卫队员们才勉勉强强出了差。
    如上所述，该村战勤部门的混炖现象，一直延至去年正月，才得到了彻底的清理。
    去年正月，该村战勤部门进行了一次改选。群众认真的选出了自己拥护的刘树、刘太担任战勤委员和会计。他们担任了干部，首先破除了情面观点，他们说：“怕惹人不沾，公事办不公群众不满意，惹的人更多。公事办公了，少数坏人不满意，也不怕得罪他。”他们接手工作以后，从没有在困难面前表示过畏缩，而是积极主动的解决了工作中的一切困难。
    第一，他们帮助战勤干部实行齐工，花了十多天的工夫，清理了过去的帐目，贴出了长工者和短工者的名单及其长短数，并说明长工的以后少出，短工的补工。但是，有两班，由于平日帐目记得草率，无法结算。于是，在本班全体队员的同意下，也做了一个了结。根据估计，长工多的以后少出一点，短工多的以后补出一部分。少出和补工的数目，在班的会议上都有了具体的规定。以后的工帐便重新开始。
    第二，建立了各种制度，首先是建立了请假制度。在全村群众同意下，战勤部规定，不论何时，何人或牲口，有病都要随时向战勤部告假。战勤干部轮流值日，负责登记。如此，在人和牲口生病的期间，轮不到它和他出差便罢，若轮到他和它出差的时候，战勤干部便可跳过病号的名字往下轮派。这里为了防止躲差现象，又更进一步的规定：凡重病卧床不起者，跳过他的名字，没有出差的，以后不补差。轻病号能干自己的营生而不能出差的，得于下次出差时补出。这种统一的规定，博得了全村群众的一致拥护，都说：“谁吃五谷不生灾，大伙儿的规定大伙儿遵守，谁也吃不了亏，谁也沾不了光。”这样既可防止个别人的躲差现象，又可照顾病人，能够齐工。否则，久病者没有免差以前，不能补差，便无法与其他自卫队员齐工，容易给调皮人以躲差的借口。其次，又规定了人和牲口外出告假制，出外告假者，轮他出差时，战勤干部便跳过他的名字往下轮派，下次出差时他补差。若外出不告假者，家里又无人顶替的，战勤干部有权替他觅人觅牲口出差，工钱多少由他出。
    第三，战勤会计掌握工帐，确定了统一的科学的记工方法，过去记工簿由各班班长掌握，记法不统一，如前段所述，有记趟子差的，有记斤不记里的，有记里不记斤的，以致齐工时发生困难。这次统一规定由战勤会计记工，班长的责职仅仅是叫人，战勤会计掌握了簿帐以后，接受了过去的教训，从来不记趟子差。每次的记工都是一清二白。
    其次，关于代耕工和趟子差的折工办法也有统一的规定，例如，一个工定十分（早饭以前的时间定二分，早饭至午饭的时间定四分，午饭至晚饭的时间又定四分），这种具体的规定严格的限止了混工的现象，过去，自卫队员给军属代耕（拨临时工），一早上顶一个工，一下午也顶一个工，以及出差十里八里都顶一个工的现象也就从此根除了。
    派差的先后也均有一定的序列。一般地，是遇差先派短工的人，后派长工的人。但在两人出工同样长短时，则按花名册子的先后次序派。该村的花名册子，是从后街挨门挨户排到前街的。
    再次，记工时不采取流水帐的记法，因为流水帐的记法不能随时齐工，因而每月结算时花费时间很多。他们采取了以户为单位，以劳动力为基础的记工办法。每次记工，实际上便等于每次齐工。
    譬如：自卫队员梁儒贵、刘太各出工多少，下次出差应谁先去？一看帐簿便可知道。
    这种记工方法，一方面派差方便，同时，因为建立起了经常的计算制度，经过一定的时间以后，干部便不需要用很多时间去结算帐目。但是，为了更多的吸取群众的意见，做得更加公平。该村依然确定了定期的检查制度，二月三月一查工，一年一总结，并贴清单。大家公约，如果有个别的自卫队员，查工时他不去参加，贴了清单也不看，派他出差他便提意见。那么，全体自卫队员都有批评他的权利。同时中队部由全村农民民主讨论规定了一条“临派差时不许翻帐，有意见出差以后回来翻”。这个决定是为了不误支差工作。
    经过这番整理以后，河方的战勤工作，已经成为全区的模范。无论是农忙的时候，或下大雨，只要战勤差的命令一来，差便立刻派下，听不到吵吵，也听不到嚷嚷，自卫队员们总是静悄悄的牵着牲口，带着绳索、布袋走到指定的地点去集合。如阴历六月十五日的派差，便是一个典型的好例子。那天正在下着倾盆大雨，上面来了命令，要往某地去运子弹，战勤干部冒着大雨，马上把差派下了，自卫队员们个个准备了干粮，待命出发。后来县里来了命令才停下没走。
    一年多以来，在该村的战勤部门，从没听到干部叫苦的声音，每天晚饭以后，自动到战勤部碰碰头，似乎已经成了他们的习惯。群众一提到刘树、刘太的名字，是人人称道，都说“他们办的公平。”同时，群众也相信该村的战勤工作，现在交给别的干部也能办得好。因为它已经打下了好的基础。
    从该村的战勤工作，我们得出这样一个经验，只要干部大公无私，积极负责，村里没有办不好的事情。
