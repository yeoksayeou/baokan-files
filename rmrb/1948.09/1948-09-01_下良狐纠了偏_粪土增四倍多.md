　　[Taiyue Electric] After the correction of deviations in Xiajiao Village, Second District of Yicheng, the masses' enthusiasm for production increased. In half a month, the masses in Xia Lianghu Natural Village of the village chopped 422,000 jin of thorny branches and cut 40,800 jin of artemisia. Calculated at 50 thorny branches per load of smoked manure and 30 jin of green artemisia per load of composted manure, 9,785 loads of fertilizer can be produced. Applying 50 loads per mu, it can fertilize 195.5 mu. Everyone said: "This is at least four times more than in previous years." According to normal calculations, applying 50 loads of manure per mu in this village can increase grain production by three dou; next year, wheat production can increase by more than 40 shi, enough for the village's summer rations for a year. They said: "I am not afraid after correcting the deviations, and I dare to produce well."

　　下良狐纠了偏
    粪土增四倍多
    【太岳电】翼城二区下交村纠偏后，群众生产情绪高。该村下良狐自然村群众半月内就刹圪枝四十二万二千斤，割草蒿四万零八百斤。按五十个圪枝薰粪一担，三十斤青蒿沤粪一担计算，可造肥九千七百八十五担。每亩上五十担，就能上一百九十五亩半。大家说：“这至少比往年增加粪土四倍多。”按通常计算，该村土质每亩上五十担粪，可增加三斗粮食；明年就能增产麦子四十多石。足够该村一年的夏屯。他们说：“纠偏后我不怕了，可敢好好生产了。”
