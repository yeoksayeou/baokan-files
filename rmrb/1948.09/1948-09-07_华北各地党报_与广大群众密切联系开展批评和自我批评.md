　　Xinhua News Agency, North China, 4th. Party newspapers in the liberated areas of North China are playing an increasingly important role and enjoying a growing reputation in the lives of the masses. In addition to striving to implement the Party's policies and reflect the demands and wishes of the masses in the news they publish, these newspapers have established various columns closely linked to the broad masses, such as "Voices of the Masses," "Correspondences between Editors and Readers," "Criticisms and Suggestions," "Inquiries and Replies," "Social Services," and "Mailbox." The former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Daily, in May of this year alone, received 48 contributions to its dedicated "Voices of the Masses" column. In addition, it accepted "complaints" from those who came to the newspaper office in person and wrote opinions on behalf of 11 readers. The newspaper office handled these "voices" of the masses with great care. Some of the contributions were published, some were excerpted and sent to relevant departments for processing before publication, and some were investigated by reporters. For example, when Wei Dianhua, a farmer from Shahe County in the Taihang District, came to the newspaper office to "complain," the newspaper sent a reporter to Shahe County with an investigation team organized by the Border Region Government to investigate and clear his name. Xu Gengdi, a farmer from Wu'an County in the Taihang District, was falsely accused and detained by the Wu'an County Government. After a reporter from the newspaper discovered this, he exposed it, immediately promoting the rectification of judicial work in Wu'an and arousing the attention of the judicial departments in the Taihang District. As a result, many county judicial sections conducted file reviews and inspections of their work. Shortly after its inception, the North China People's Daily published reports on certain laissez-faire phenomena in production leadership in counties such as Pingshan and Jianping (a newly established county west of Pingshan), enabling various localities to conscientiously implement the North China Central Bureau's policy of uniting in production. In the "Criticisms and Suggestions" section of the Ji-Lu-Yu Daily, after it was revealed in June that the production department of the administrative office of the district had seized a cigarette machine belonging to a merchant from Changyuan, the administrative office conducted an inspection, returned the machine to its original owner, and sent a letter to the newspaper office explaining the handling of the matter. In July, after the newspaper revealed that the production team of the Ninth Sub-district of the district had borrowed utensils from villagers in Zhang Niuwu Village and delayed their return, the production team immediately convened a Party meeting to conduct a review of mass discipline and sent cadres to Niuwu Village to apologize. Newspapers in Taihang, Taiyue, Ji-Zhong, Ji-Nan, and Bei-Yue have also strengthened the connection between the masses and the Party and the government through the same work, promoting land reform, supporting the front lines, and production for disaster relief. High-level Party and government leading organs in various localities attach great importance to the criticisms in Party newspapers, advocate criticism, and stipulate that replying to Party newspapers' inquiries on work is the duty of all levels of organs and cadres. Lin Tie, secretary of the Ji-Zhong District Party Committee, pointed out at the district's communications work conference in June: "We should not be afraid of criticism in movements and work. Only by carrying out criticism and self-criticism can we improve our work better. Therefore, the practice of only allowing reports of advantages and achievements, not allowing reports of shortcomings and errors, and only reporting good news and not reporting bad news in some places is not allowed. On the other hand, we should also pay attention to preventing only finding shortcomings and problems and not making positive and active reports, which is also incorrect." The Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office recently instructed its subordinates to pay attention to the criticisms of various works published in Party newspapers, believing that this is a powerful weapon for enabling governments and cadres at all levels to accept the supervision of the people and correct bureaucratic work styles. The instruction pointed out: (1) The criticisms and inquiries raised in the newspapers must be examined in a serious manner, with a high degree of enthusiasm for serving the people, and in a timely manner. Any phenomenon of refusing to inspect or deliberately delaying should be strictly criticized. If the mistake is persisted in, disciplinary action should be taken. (2) If leading departments and responsible comrades find criticisms of their departments in the newspapers, regardless of where the opinions come from, they should immediately conduct an inspection. There should be no phenomenon of ignoring or shelving, and even less should they shift the blame to subordinates or adopt a bureaucratic attitude. (3) No department should simply examine the matter that has been criticized because of that matter. After clarifying the situation, it should carefully analyze it, and thereby connect it to similar matters, find the problems in leadership, find the key, and solve them thoroughly and comprehensively. However, on the whole, the work of fully developing criticism and self-criticism by Party newspapers in various localities is still far from sufficient, and some local Party committees still have a tendency to dislike criticism. Strengthening the critical work of Party newspapers and establishing closer ties with the masses remains an important task for Party newspapers in North China.

### 华北各地党报　与广大群众密切联系开展批评和自我批评

　　华北各地党报
  　与广大群众密切联系开展批评和自我批评
    【新华社华北四日电】华北解放区各地党报在群众生活中的作用和声誉正在日益增高。这些报纸除了在其所登载的新闻中，力求贯彻党的政策、反映群众的要求与愿望之外，都设有与广大群众密切联系的各种专栏，如“群众呼声”、“编读往来”、“批评与建议”、“询问与答复”、“社会服务”、“信箱”等。前晋冀鲁豫人民日报，仅今年五月一个月，即在其专设的“群众呼声”栏内，收到来稿四十八件，此外还接受亲来报馆者的“告状”，并为十一位读者代书意见。对于群众的这些“呼声”，报馆都慎重予以处理，有的把来稿披露，有的把来稿先摘述要点，寄交有关部门处理，然后披露，有的派记者前往调查。如太行区沙河县农民魏殿花来报馆“告状”，报馆即派记者协同边区政府组织调查团赴沙河县调查，为之洗清冤苦；太行区武安县农妇徐更的被人诬陷，扣押于武安县政府，报馆记者发现后，予以揭露，立即促进武安司法工作的整顿，并引起太行区司法部门的重视，许多县司法科都因而进行清理档案，检查工作。华北人民日报创刊后不久，即揭载了平山、建屏（新设县，在平山以西）等县领导生产中的某些自流现象，使各地认真贯彻执行华北中央局团结生产的方针。冀鲁豫日报“批评与建议”之内，六月揭露该区行署生产部门侵占长垣商人卷烟机后，行署即进行检查，把机器退还原主，并致函报馆说明处理经过。七月该报揭露该区九分区生产股借用了张牛吴村村民用具，拖延不还后，该生产股立即召开党内会议，进行群众纪律检查，并派干部至牛吴村道歉。太行、太岳、冀中、冀南、北岳等地报纸，也都以同样的工作加强了群众和党和政府的联系，推动了土地改革、支援前线、生产救灾等工作。各地高级党政领导机关都很重视党报的批评，都会提倡批评，并规定答复党报对工作的质询为各级机关与干部的义务。冀中区党委书记林铁在六月该区通讯工作会议上指出：“在运动中和工作中我们应该不怕批评，只有开展批评和自我批评，工作才会更好的改进。因此有些地方只许报导优点成绩，不许报导缺点错误，只报喜不报忧的作风，是不准许的。另一方面，也应注意防止只找缺点毛病，不做正面的积极的报导，这也是不对的。”冀鲁豫行署于日前指令所属重视党报刊载的对各种工作的批评文字，认为这是使各级政府与干部很好的接受人民大众的监督，纠正官僚主义作风的有力武器。指示指出：（一）报纸上所提出的批评与询问，必需以严肃的态度，本高度为人民服务的热情，及时检查。任何拒绝检查或故意拖延的现象，都应受到严格的批评。如果坚持错误则更要受到纪律的处分。（二）各个领导部门和负责同志，如果在报纸上发现对本部门作的批评时，不问其意见来自何处，应该马上进行检查，绝不许有忽视与搁置现象，更不能诿过下级，不能采取官僚主义态度。（三）任何部门不应该因为那件事情遭受了批评，就单纯检查那件事情，应于弄清情况之后，仔细的进行分析，并从而联系到类似的事情，找出领导的毛病，找出关键，予以彻底全面的解决。但是整个地说来，各地党报对于充分开展批评和自我批评的工作，做得还很不够，某些地方党委也还存在着不喜欢批评的倾向。加强党报的批评工作和更密切地联系群众，仍然是华北党报的重要任务。
