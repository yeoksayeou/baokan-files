Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th.
Comprehensive reports indicate that since the Kuomintang government implemented its so-called "currency reform," "price controls," and "ban on the black market," prices have risen in all major cities under its control, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Chengdu, Guiyang, and Xi'an. Black market activities continue. Taking Shanghai, the economic center of the Kuomintang government, as an example, "cotton, cotton yarn, flour, miscellaneous grains, cigarettes, and other daily necessities have all risen in price compared to the previous day" (Reuters, 25th). A large number of merchants holding newly obtained fake gold yuan certificates "have begun to attack the market. Those who hoard gold and US dollars have switched to hoarding commodities" (Associated Press, 24th). The fake Shanghai Municipal Government's wholesale commodity index, released on the 25th, also admitted that "from August 16th to 21st, prices rose by an average of 15 percent." According to an Associated Press report on the 24th, the Shanghai authorities were "shocked by the continuing rise in prices" and arrested "more than a hundred vegetable, fish, and meat vendors" on the morning of the 24th. Economic agents and police are arbitrarily breaking into all stock markets, grain stores, warehouses, and banks to conduct "inspections" and make arrests. They even break into stationery stores and "drag merchants out," imposing fines and imprisonment. Therefore, as reported by an Associated Press reporter on the 25th, Shanghai merchants are "clearing their shelves to retaliate against the government's order to freeze prices at the August 19th level. There is very little pork in Shanghai's major food markets today (the 25th), and live chickens are almost non-existent. Stale fish is sold at the highest price for top-quality goods on August 19th. Tofu is sold at the highest limit price, but the quantity is reduced."

In other areas, Chiang Kai-shek is arresting merchants and peddlers en masse, attempting to suppress prices with fascist violence. According to continuous reports from the bandit Central News Agency, economic agents and police arrested four merchants in Nanjing on the 25th. In Qingdao, 53 black market gold certificate merchants were arrested. In Guiyang, several cases involving meat, rice, and salt were uncovered. In Chengdu, several stores, yarn factories, and salt shops were inspected and fined on the 24th and 25th, and two silver dollar vendors were arrested. In Xi'an, eight stores, including general merchandise stores, pharmacies, and barbershops, have been ordered to suspend business for five days each and fined 30 fake gold yuan certificates. In Tianjin, several department stores and hotels have been ordered to suspend business for three days or handed over to the so-called "Special Criminal Court." In Xuzhou, on the Central China front, more than a hundred rice and meat merchants and silver dollar peddlers have been arrested. In Peiping, Guangzhou, Hankou, Wuchang, Hangzhou, Nanchang, and other places, merchants are also being arrested on a large scale due to rising prices. Along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, the black market is particularly active.

The above situation proves that the Kuomintang government's so-called "currency reform" and the "gold yuan certificate" it issued still cannot deceive the people's discerning eyes. The so-called "emergency decree" to "control prices" and "ban the black market" is nothing more than a fascist violent suppression of all classes of people who oppose this large-scale plunder. However, this kind of violent suppression cannot maintain the "credit" of the "gold yuan certificate," just as it cannot avoid the bankruptcy of the "legal tender."

　　伪金元券骗不了人民
  　蒋区物价普遍上涨
  　蒋贼妄图以暴力压抑大捕商人小贩
    【新华社陕北三十日电】综合各方消息：国民党政府于实行所谓“改革币制”，以及“限制物价”、“禁止黑市”后，其统治区内京、沪、平、津、汉口、广州、杭州、成都、贵阳、西安等各大城市，日来物价无不上涨，黑市也继续活动。以国民党政府的经济中心上海为例，“棉花、棉纱、面粉、杂粮、香烟及其他日用必需品，较前一日均有上涨”（路透社二十五日电）。握有最近获得的伪金圆券的大批商人，“已开始袭击市场。囤积黄金美钞的人，已改而囤积商品”（合众社二十四日电）。伪上海市政府于二十五日发表的批发商品指数，也承认：“八月十六日到二十一日，物价平均上涨百分之十五”。据合众社二十四日消息称：上海市当局已为物价仍然上涨的“倾向所震惊”，于二十四日晨逮捕“蔬菜鱼肉商贩百余人”之多。经济特务及警察正在任意闯入一切证券市场、粮行、货栈、银行，进行“检查”并捕人。甚至闯入文具店，将“商人拖出来”，处以罚金和监禁。因此，如美联社记者二十五日所报导的，上海商人正“把货架肃清，来报复政府冻结物价于八月十九日水平的命令。上海各主要食品市场上，今日（二十五日）猪肉很少，活鸡几告绝迹。不新鲜的鱼类，以八月十九日上等货的最高价格出售。豆腐以最高的限定价格出售，但数量却减少了”。
    其他各地，蒋贼正在大批逮捕商人、小贩，企图以法西斯的暴力手段压抑物价。据匪中央社连日报导供认：经济特务及警察，二十五日在南京逮捕商人四名。青岛逮捕金钞黑市商人五十三名。贵阳逮捕肉、米、盐等数起。成都于二十四、二十五两日检查商店、纱厂、盐店数家受罚，银元贩两名被捕。西安已有行货、药房、理发等八家商店，各被勒令停业五天及罚伪金圆券三十元。天津百货、旅馆业数家，被分别勒令停业三天或交所谓“特种刑庭”。华中前线的徐州，共逮捕米、肉商人及银元小贩百余人。其余在北平、广州、汉口、武昌、杭州、南昌等地，亦因物价上涨，而在大捕商人。京沪路沿线各地，则黑市非当活跃。
    上述这些情况，证明国民党政府的所谓“改革币制”，它所发行的“金圆券”，依然骗不过人民的雪亮的眼睛，而所谓“限制物价”、“禁止黑市”的“紧急处分令”，则不过是对所有反对这次大掠夺的各阶层人民采取法西斯的暴力镇压而已，但是这种暴力镇压决不能维持“金圆券”的“信用”，正如它之不能避免“法币”的破产一样。
