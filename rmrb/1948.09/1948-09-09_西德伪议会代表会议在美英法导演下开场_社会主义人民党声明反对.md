Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 6th: Reports from various sources indicate that after the US and British governments repeatedly declared that the establishment of a West German separatist government would not be delayed, the so-called West German "Parliamentary Representative Conference" was launched on September 1st in the city of Bonn (south of Cologne) in the British occupation zone, under the direction of the US, British, and French "political advisors." A total of sixty-five representatives appointed by the state parliaments attended the conference, which was chaired by Adenauer, chairman of the Christian Democratic Party in the British occupation zone. The task of the conference is to draft a so-called "West German National Constitution Draft" for the West German puppet regime, which the London Six-Power Conference unilaterally decided to establish this autumn, so as to "legitimize the division of Germany carried out under foreign orders" (Berliner Zeitung). Lehman, leader of the German Socialist People's Party (i.e., the West German Communist Party) attending the meeting, proposed a motion at the opening meeting demanding the immediate dissolution of this conference, but it was rejected. The leading organ of the German Socialist People's Party also issued a statement strongly opposing this "representative conference established in violation of the Yalta and Potsdam resolutions." The statement said: "The establishment of the Parliamentary Representative Conference not only has nothing to do with the German people, but also violates the will of the vast majority of the German people. What the German people demand is nothing other than the convening of a National Assembly by the German people to formulate a constitution and establish a new democratic republic. The leading organ of the German Socialist People's Party believes that the draft constitution drafted by the German People's Committee, in which people from all strata of German society participate, is the basis for the all-German constitution."

　　西德伪议会代表会议在美英法导演下开场
  　社会主义人民党声明反对
    【新华社陕北六日电】各方报导：在美、英政府一再声明西德分裂政府决不延缓成立以后，所谓西德“议会代表会议”已于本月一日在美、英、法“政治顾问”导演之下，在英占区波昂城（科隆以南）开锣上场。各州议会指派出席会议代表共六十五名，会议由英占区基督教民主党主席阿登纳任主席。会议任务是替伦敦六国会议片面决定要在今秋成立的西德傀儡政权起草所谓“西德国家宪法草案”，使“根据外国命令而进行的对德国的分裂得以合法化”（柏林日报），出席会议之德国社会主义人民党（即西德共产党）领袖雷曼在开幕会议上提出动议、要求立即解散这一会议，但遭到否决。德国社会主义人民党领导机关亦发表声明，严正反对这一“违背雅尔塔和波茨顿决议而建立的代表会议”，声明称：“议会代表会议的建立不仅与德国人民没有关系，而且违反绝大多数德国人民的意志。德国人民所要求的不是任何别的东西，而是由德国人民召开国民议会以制定宪法并建立新的民主共和国。德国社会主义人民党领导机关认为，由有德国各阶层人民参加的德国人民委员会所起草的宪法草案，才是全德宪法的基础。”
