　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Free Greece Radio recently broadcast a communique from the Greek Democratic Army stating: The first stage of the major battle in the northern Pindus Mountains has concluded. From June 14th to August 21st, the Greek Democratic Army, with unparalleled heroism, defended the positions in the Boron-Solikas and Grammos regions, successfully executing the Supreme Command's operational plan and victoriously annihilating the enemy's elite troops. It is estimated that a total of 22,800 officers and soldiers of the Royalist Fascist army were killed, wounded, or captured, 35 enemy aircraft were shot down, 18 enemy tanks and 5 field guns were destroyed, and countless spoils of war were seized. The Supreme Command of the Democratic Army sent a telegram to the Democratic Army in the area congratulating them on their great victory, pointing out that the result of this victory has shattered all the plans of the Royalist Fascist army headquarters to eliminate the Democratic Army in this campaign. The Democratic Army in the Epirus, Roumeli, Hesia, Trikala, and Kalambaka regions completed significant offensive operations in coordination with the actions of the Democratic Army in the northern Pindus Mountains. Currently, the main force of the Democratic Army in the northern Pindus Mountains broke through the enemy's lines on the evening of August 21st and is advancing east and southeast.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Simultaneously with the Greek Democratic Army in the Grammos Mountains in the northern Pindus Mountains annihilating over 20,000 enemy troops and victoriously breaking through the enemy's defense lines to engage in outside operations, the Democratic Army throughout Greece launched widespread offensives. According to a report from the Electric News Agency on the 25th: "The Democratic Army continues to conduct victorious offensive operations in various regions. Important transportation lines and power stations in several provinces have been controlled or destroyed by the Democratic Army. These new offensives by the Democratic Army have forced the Athens government to conscript another 30,000 men into the army at the behest of the Americans." Previously, during the major battle in the Grammos Mountains, because half of the Greek Royalist Fascist army was tied down in that mountainous area, it created favorable conditions for the Democratic Army to launch widespread attacks in other regions. Now these attacks are seriously threatening the US-Greek reactionaries. Even a United Press reporter admitted in a report on the 24th: "Guerrilla warfare has reached an unprecedentedly bad level." The Democratic Army "shells provincial capitals, ambushes transport convoys, lays landmines on roads, and destroys reservoirs." In the Larissa, Trikala, and Karditsa regions northwest of Athens, "the gendarmerie can no longer control the situation there. Guerrillas raid American military installations there, tear down the American flag, and shred it to pieces." The Democratic Army even "attacked and entered the heavily defended coastal city of Aegion in the northern Peloponnese peninsula, and former Deputy Prime Minister Konnilopoulos was almost captured." The Democratic Army's offensive has caused significant casualties among American officers commanding the Royalist army on the front lines. According to a TASS report: Van Fleet, head of the US military mission in Greece, has recalled all US officers from the front lines and ordered British officers to replace them. Van Fleet's move is a "double-edged sword, both saving the lives of American officers and shifting the responsibility for defeat to the British."

　　平都斯山北部奋战两个多月
  　希民主军歼敌两万
  　全国各地同时展开胜利攻势
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】自由希腊电台顷广播希腊民主军公报称：平都斯山北部大战的第一阶段业已结束。希腊民主军自六月十四日至八月廿一日间，以无可比拟的英雄主义坚持波戎——索利卡斯、格拉姆斯地区的阵地，胜利地执行了高级司令部的作战计划，胜利地歼灭了敌人的精锐部队。计共毙伤俘保皇法西斯军官兵二万二千八百人，击落敌机三十五架，击毁敌坦克十八辆、野炮五门，并缴获战利品无算。民主军高级司令部特致电该区民主军祝贺其伟大的胜利，指出这一胜利的结果已粉碎了保皇法西斯军司令部企图在这次战役中消灭民主军的一切计划。在艾匹鲁斯、罗米利亚、海西亚、特里喀拉与卡拉姆巴卡地区的民主军，于配合平都斯山北部民主军的行动中均完成重大的攻势作战。现北部平都斯山区民主军的主力，已于八月二十一日晚间突破敌人防线向东及东南方向推进中。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】于平都斯山北部格拉姆斯山区希腊民主军歼敌二万余人并胜利突破敌军防线，转入外线作战同时，全希各地民主军广泛展开攻势。据电通社二十五日电：“民主军继续在各地进行胜利的攻势作战，若干省的重要交通线与电力站已被民主军控制或破坏。民主军这些新的攻势，使雅典政府不得不在美国人授意下再征调三万人入伍。”前此在格拉姆斯山区大战期间，由于希腊保皇法西斯军之半数被吸住在该山区，造成了其他各地民主军广泛出击的有利形势。现在这些出击已严重威胁美希反动派。连合众社记者也于二十四日报导中承认：“游击战已到达了空前最坏的程度。”民主军“炮击各省省会，伏击运输队，在路上埋地雷，炸毁蓄水池”。在雅典西北的拉利萨、特利喀拉、卡地扎地区，“宪兵已不能控制那里的情势，游击队突袭那里的美国军事机关，拉下了美国国旗，把它撕成粉碎。”民主军并一度“攻入防御坚强的摩里亚半岛北部沿海之艾吉安城，前副总理康尼洛普洛斯差一点被俘。”民主军的攻势已使在前线指挥保皇军的美国军官伤亡重大。据塔斯社报导：美驻希军事使团团长范佛立特已将火线上的美军官悉数召回，并下令英国军官代替他们。范氏此举为“一箭双雕之计，既挽救了美国军官的性命，又把战败的责任转嫁于英国人”。
