　　To the Editor:
    During my inspection of locusts in Xiaoma Village, Fourth District, Weixian County, I discovered over one hectare of wasteland near the village, with lush grass growing two to three chi high. According to the village cadres and residents, this land belongs to the Nonghui (Farmers' Association) of Houzhai Cunbu Village, Fifth District, Nanle County, and has been lying waste for two or three years. Although the two villages are only five li apart, and the wasteland is mostly located on the edge of Xiaoma Village, Houzhai Cunbu Village in Nanle County is not under the leadership of the Jilu Military Region but under the jurisdiction of the Jiluyu Military Region. Consequently, the masses are hesitant to cultivate it. The soil quality of this land is excellent and is not prone to flooding. It is said that in normal years, it can yield over one shi of grain per mu. Based on this calculation, this year's loss amounts to over a hundred shi, which is a significant loss. It is hoped that the leadership of Nanle County will promptly send someone to Houzhai Cunbu Village to conduct an inspection and quickly lead the masses to eliminate this wasteland, ensuring that they do not miss the wheat planting season. Otherwise, the losses will be even greater.

### 请南乐县快检查荒地

　　请南乐县快检查荒地编辑同志：
    我这次到魏县四区小马村检查＠蝗，发现该村附近有一顷多荒地，二、三尺高的青草长得很茂盛。据该村干部和群众说，这都是南乐县五区后翟村步村农会的，荒了二、三年了。两个村虽然只距离五里地，荒地又多在小马村村边、可是南乐后翟村步村不归冀鲁军区领导，而归冀鲁豫军区管，因之，群众想种不敢种。这些土地土质很好，又不受水淹，据说平常年景每亩可收一石多粮食。这样计算，今年就少收百几多石，这是个很大的损失。希望南乐县领导上赶快派专人去后翟村步村作一检查，迅速领导群众消灭这些荒地，尽量让群众不误种麦。否则损失就会更大。
