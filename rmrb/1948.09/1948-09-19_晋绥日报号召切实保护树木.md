　　Jin Sui Daily Calls for
  　Earnest Protection of Trees
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 15th】The Jin Sui Daily recently published an editorial calling for the earnest protection of trees. The article pointed out that since last winter, many instances of tree felling have occurred in various regions. Some farmers lack long-term planning, cutting down the trees they were allocated to sell or burn; some landlords and idlers are unwilling to work and secretly cut down trees for firewood. All regions should pay attention to and immediately stop these behaviors that are detrimental to production and long-term construction. The article believes that, apart from the large forests belonging to the government which should be under unified and strengthened management by the government, public trees belonging to the village should be managed by the village representative assembly, and a forest protection agreement can be discussed and decided by the villagers. For private trees, forest protection regulations can also be established to prohibit indiscriminate felling. Those who achieve results in forest protection and afforestation should be commended and rewarded. The article also pointed out that the Jin Sui border region is mountainous and has favorable conditions for afforestation; at the same time, due to uneven climate conditions of drought and flood, there is also an urgent need for afforestation and serious forest protection. This is a major event that benefits the masses and eliminates malpractices, and everyone should earnestly do this work well.

　　晋绥日报号召
  　切实保护树木
    【新华社晋绥十五日电】晋绥日报顷著论号召切实保护树木。该文指出自去冬以来，各地发生砍伐树木的事情很多。有的农民缺乏常远打算，把分到的树木，砍下卖了，或者烧了；有的地主和二流子不愿劳动，偷砍树木当柴烧。各地应重视并立即制止这些有害生产及长期建设的行为。该文认为，除属于政府的大山林应由政府统一加强管理外，属于村的公树即由村代表会管理，并可由村民议定护林公约。对于私人树木，亦可订出护林纪律，以禁滥伐。对于护林造林有成绩的，应给予表扬和奖励。该文并指出：晋绥边区多山，具备造林有利条件；同时，由于气候旱涝不匀，也迫切需要造林与认真护林。这是为群众兴利除弊的一件大事，大家应认真做好这个工作。
