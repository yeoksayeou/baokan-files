Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 20th: Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave important instructions on the work of the Northwest Party newspapers at the Yan'an news workers' meeting commemorating "September 1st" Journalist Day. He first pointed out that the Masses Daily has made great progress in linking with reality and the masses since this spring, and encouraged everyone to further improve the newspaper in the current situation of revolutionary victory and development. They immediately conducted a specific review of the newspaper. He pointed out that a major problem in the newspaper's current communication work is that the quality of the manuscripts cannot keep up with the development of the quantity. This is reflected in the newspaper as fragmented and piecemeal news, with many enumerations of phenomena. Many manuscripts cannot systematically, centrally, and analytically reflect an event or a movement, so that readers cannot see the whole picture of the entire event or movement. Therefore, the role of enlightening and guiding work, and the role of exchanging experiences to improve and promote work are not great. In order to overcome this shortcoming, it is necessary to provide ideological, policy, and work-style guidance to correspondents; to help correspondents constantly study their business and specifically help them improve their writing skills from their own practical work; and to cultivate a large number of worker and peasant correspondents to transform readers into authors. Only by relying on such a foundation can we say that the newspaper is run by the whole Party.

In terms of editing, we must overcome the phenomena of no center, no system, and being scattered. To this end, the editing work must be combined with the research and summary work of the party, government, and military leadership organs at all levels in the border area. To achieve this, it is not enough to rely solely on reporter interviews, because they are not familiar with the overall situation of various departments. It is both laborious and impossible to grasp the center. Therefore, the party, government, and military organs at all levels must work together. However, if the various organs only provide the newspaper with immature materials without correct conclusions, it will still not be of great help to the work. In the future, we must summarize the work on a regular basis and provide the newspaper with mature materials so that it can be combined with reporter interviews. The Northwest Bureau will stipulate this system, and all agencies must implement it conscientiously. This is a win-win situation that will both improve the work of the leading organs and make the newspaper better.

At this point, Comrade Xi Zhongxun pointed out that the newspaper's insufficient reflection on the life of the troops is a major shortcoming. Armed struggle is the central link in the Party's leadership of all work today, and without military affairs, the newspaper cannot see the development of the revolutionary movement. Therefore, truthfully reflecting the situation of the troops is currently the most practical educational work. Overcoming the above weaknesses is an important task for the staff of the Masses Daily.

Comrade Xi Zhongxun believes that some comrades do not pay attention to and study the news in this area, but only like to read news from other distant areas, which is a manifestation of being divorced from reality and aiming too high. However, the newspaper should also examine whether it has really done a good job in running the newspaper. He pointed out that, in summary of the above reviews, in order to run the newspaper well, the reports must be closely combined with the Party's current tasks. After any new task is put forward, it should first be reflected in the newspaper, otherwise the role of the Party newspaper will be reduced. For example, after the Party Central Committee put forward the opposition to indiscipline and anarchy, there was very little reflection on this issue in the newspaper, which deserves attention and review. Therefore, how to better integrate the newspaper with reality is the first issue that the newspaper staff should pay serious attention to.

Comrade Xi Zhongxun then discussed the issue of reporters' style, the use of criticism and self-criticism, and the class position of the Party newspaper. He said: A good Party newspaper reporter must first be able to connect with the masses, go deep among the masses, and participate in practical work in a simple and down-to-earth manner. Even if they cannot do it themselves, they should at least take a look, talk to them, or hold a discussion; and avoid hearsay and conjecture. The exaggerated style of writing is extremely harmful, and the wording must be as realistic as possible. He cited a previous frontline communication as an example. In that communication, a soldier who continued to fight after being injured and blocked the wound with a towel was described as "filling a ditch." Such a moving heroic deed was damaged by such exaggeration.

He emphasized that the newspaper does not show enough spirit of criticism and self-criticism. In addition, some comrades still have deviations in their understanding and use of this weapon, and lack a comprehensive and developmental perspective in conducting criticism and self-criticism. For example, the newspaper once criticized the work of a certain place that was working hard to improve its shortcomings without encouraging it to consolidate this progress, which poured cold water on it inappropriately. He pointed out that we do not need formalistic criticism and self-criticism, which will only turn the problem upside down and undermine the guiding role. The newspaper's criticism is the Party's criticism, and the editor's note should represent the opinion of the Northwest Bureau, so it cannot be added casually. All opinions and thoughts in the newspaper must conform to the will of the Northwest Bureau, and no opinions and thoughts that deviate from the Party's will are allowed. Only in this way can the Masses Daily become a good mouthpiece for the entire Northwest Party and the entire Northwest people.

　　西北局书记习仲勋同志指示
  　把党报再提高一步
    有系统有中心有分析的反映运动全貌
    【新华社西北二十日电】中共中央西北局书记习仲勋，在延安新闻工作者纪念“九一”记者节会议上，对西北党报工作，作了重要的指示。他首先指出今春以来群众日报在联系实际、联系群众方面已有很大进步，勉励大家在目前革命胜利发展的形势下，把报纸再提高一步。他们即对该报作了具体检讨。他指出：目前该报通讯工作中的一个主要问题是稿件质量赶不上数量的发展。表现在报纸上消息零碎、片断，现象罗列多，很多稿件不能对一件事或一个运动，作有系统有中心有分析的反映，使读者不能看出整个事件或运动的全貌，因此对于工作的启发与指导作用和交流经验以改进与提高工作的作用不大。为克服这种缺点，必须对通讯员有思想、政策和工作方针的领导；要帮助通讯员经常钻研业务，十分具体地从通讯员本身实际工作中去帮助他们提高写作能力；要大量培养工农通讯员，把读者变为作者。只有依靠这样一个基础办报，才说得上是全党办报。
    在编辑工作方面，要克服没有中心、没有系统和零散的现象。为此，必须使编辑工作和边区党政军各级领导机关的研究总结工作结合起来。要做到这一点，光靠记者采访是不够的，因为他们不熟悉各部门全盘情况，既费力又不能掌握中心。因之必须各级党、政、军机关共同努力。但如果各机关只供给报社不成熟的材料，没有正确的结论，对工作还是无大帮助。今后必须按期总结工作，供给报纸以成熟材料，使它与记者采访结合起来。西北局将规定这种制度，要各机关切实执行。这是一举两得的事，既可使领导机关的工作做好，报纸也会办得更好。
    至此，习仲勋同志指出，报纸对部队生活反映不够，是一个很大缺点。武装斗争是今天党领导全部工作的中心环节，报纸离了军事，就看不出革命运动的发展。因此，真实地反映部队情况，是目前最有实际教育意义的工作。克服上述弱点，乃是群众日报社工作人员的一个重要任务。
    习仲勋同志认为有些同志不重视与研究本区消息，只喜欢看远的别的地区的消息的现象，是一种脱离实际、好高鹜远思想的表现。但报社也应检讨是否真把报纸办好。他指出，综合上面的检讨，要办好报纸，必须使报导与党的当前任务密切结合起来。任何一个新的任务提出后，首先应在报纸上反映出来，否则就降低了党报的作用。比如党中央提出反对无纪律无政府状态后，报上对这个问题反映很少，就值得注意和检讨。因此如何更好的使报纸与实际密切结合，乃是报社工作人员首先应严重注意的问题。
    习仲勋同志继论及记者作风、运用批评自我批评和党报的阶级立场问题。他说：一个好的党报记者，首先要能联系群众深入群众，朴素踏实地参加到实际工作中去，即使不能专门动手去做，起码也要看一看，谈一谈或者开个座谈会；切忌道听途说，捕风捉影。写作上的夸张作风是极有害的，用语必须力求切合实际。他举报上一篇前线通讯为例，那篇通讯中把受伤后继续杀敌的一个战士用毛巾堵伤口描写为“好象填塞一个水渠似的”。这样一个动人的英雄事迹，就被这样的夸张损坏了。
    他着重指出报纸表现批评与自我批评的精神还不够。此外，某些同志对这一武器的认识和使用还有偏差，缺乏从全面、从发展的观点去进行批评和自我批评。如报上曾对正努力改进缺点的某地工作，不用鼓励的办法去巩固这种进步，而不恰当地加以批评，泼了冷水。他指出：我们不需要形式主义的批评与自我批评，这只会把问题颠倒起来，损害了指导作用。报纸的批评就是党的批评，报纸编者的按语应当代表西北局的意见，因此不能随随便便就按。报纸上一切言论思想，都要合乎西北局的意志，不允许有离开党的意志的言论思想。只有这样，群众日报才能成为全西北党的和全西北人民的良好的喉舌。
