　　Pingshun and Yushe Village Cadres Actively Promote Education with Success

    [Taihang News] Some villages in the second and third districts of Taihang in Yushe, Pingshun, and Licheng counties, after reviewing and correcting past biases in education, cadres are actively helping elementary school teachers run schools well. In Wuyuan Village, the second district of Yushe, Village Head Comrade Zhou Shengrong has always been actively responsible for his work and is very enthusiastic about education. He always participates in the Xuanwei Committee meetings to jointly study propaganda and education work. Whenever he has time, he visits the school to see what difficulties the teachers have and what they need. He persuades the children not to be playful and to study hard. He often says, "No matter what work is done, it cannot be separated from propaganda and education." Dazhao Village in the seventh district of Pingshun is a scattered village, forty li around, making it difficult for all children to attend school. More than 70 percent of the school-age children in the village are herding cattle. In Qingnan Village, the second district of Licheng, no children enrolled when school started this time. After several parent meetings, they unanimously said, "The children only fight and don't learn to read at school, so it's better for them to do some work at home." The teacher made a self-criticism on the spot. However, the number of enrolled children was still small. The teacher consulted with Zhao Shusheng, the chairman of the Farmers' Association. Zhao said, "If you can guarantee that the children will learn to read, I guarantee that I will persuade the parents to send their children to school." That day, he immediately mobilized door-to-door. Li Shiyun often said that the school was a grazing field, and that children could not learn a single word, so he would not let his children go to school. Comrade Zhao Shusheng repeatedly persuaded and mobilized him, using the principle that not being able to read would cause great losses, and he got through to him. He personally sent his daughter to school and made many suggestions to the school, "Children should be taught more abacus and daily-use writing, and should not be beaten or scolded randomly." Zhao Tuhai, who was fifteen years old, played at home every day and did not go to school. Zhao Shusheng took the time to talk to him every day, not afraid of trouble, and persuaded him in every way. He also mobilized his parents, and finally convinced him. Zhao Tuhai enrolled in school and studied very actively. The village elementary school has gradually become standardized. Shi Yusheng, the education director of Baojiajiao Village in the second district, and Wang Zhagen, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, are very concerned about the school. They specifically divided the work. They did not take a nap at noon and convened meetings of parents and women. Comrade Shi Yusheng used accounting methods to get through to the parents who were unwilling to let their children go to school. Wang Zhagen mobilized the women, saying, "If women want liberation and want to have a position, one is production and the other is culture. It's so pitiful that we've been blind all our lives. If children don't study from an early age, they will blame us adults when they grow up." The women's thinking was cleared, and both boys and girls enrolled in school.

　　保证儿童识字学文化
  　平顺榆社村干部积极劝学有成绩
    【太行讯】太行二、三分区榆社、平顺、黎城等县某些村，检讨纠正过去教育上的偏向，干部积极帮助小学教员办好学校。榆社二区武源村，村长周生荣同志一贯对工作积极负责，对教育工作也很热心，宣委会开会时，他总要参加共同研究宣教工作。他有空就去学校看看教员有什么困难？须要什么东西？劝说儿童们不要贪玩，好好学习，他经常说：“无论哪一件工作都离不了宣传和教育。”平顺七区达到村是个分散的村子，周围四十里，儿童很难全部入学，占全村学龄儿童百分之七十以上的儿童都在放牛。黎城二区青南村，这次开学没有儿童，经过几次家长会议，却异口同声说：“儿童们到学校光打架不认字，不如在家还能多少做些事。”教员当场作了检讨。但入学儿童还是不多。教员找农会长赵书升商量。赵说：“你既能保证叫儿童识字，我保证劝解家长们送儿童入学。”当天即挨门挨户动员。李士云常说学校是放牛场，一个字也认不下，不叫孩子去上学。赵书升同志再三说服动员，用不识字吃大亏的道理，打通了他的思想，他亲自送女儿入学，并对学校提了好多意见，“应多教儿童学珠算日用文字等，不要叫乱打乱骂。”赵秃孩十五岁，每天在家玩耍不上学，赵书升每天抽时间和他谈话，不怕麻烦好说歹说，又动员家长，终于说转了，赵秃孩入了学，学习还很积极。该村小学校已逐步正规化。二区暴家脚村教育主任石玉胜、农会主席王扎根，对学校很关心，他们具体分了工，晌午不睡，召开家长和妇女会议，石玉胜同志用算帐的方法打通了家长不愿叫儿童上学的思想；王扎根动员妇女说：“妇女要求解放，要求有地位，一个是生产，一个是文化。咱们一辈子是瞎汉多可怜，儿童从小不念书，大了埋怨咱大人。”妇女们思想打通了，男女儿童都入了学。（杨守庭、程志远、连保堂、李爱虎、王有田、赵志民）
