　　A Certain Military Supply Worker
  　Protects Revolutionary Materials
  　Drains Warehouse in the Rain
    [Our Newspaper] The living quarters of the workers at the × factory of the First Military Supply Clothing Bureau suffered many collapses during the last heavy rain. Comrade Gao Zhitong, the worker group leader, immediately checked the warehouse and discovered that a warehouse storing 10,000 jin of Sophora japonica seeds was leaking severely, with water also pouring into the room from the doorway. Sophora japonica seeds are extremely susceptible to water damage. Comrade Gao quickly returned to the workers' dormitory and informed everyone. Workers like comrades Qi Xincai immediately started moving the seeds to a room half a mile away. Once the news spread, all the workers and cadres in the factory participated. It was raining at the time, and the streets were covered in half a foot of muddy water. The workers, shirtless and barefoot, rushed to carry the seeds. Some gathered five or six people to pull large carts (it was too rainy to use livestock). Some used small carts to push, and some carried them on their backs. Worker Qi Xincai had been suffering from back pain for half a month and was still taking medicine. You Zhenjun had injured his leg in the line of duty only four days prior, and the wound was still oozing, but they both participated. Some carried loads seven or eight times, each time carrying 120 jin. The leadership, fearing that the heavy rain would harm the people, advised everyone to stop and wait for the rain to lessen, but the workers insisted on continuing and carried everything away in one go.

　　某军供工人
  　爱护革命资材
  　冒雨倒转库房
    【本报讯】军供第一被服局×厂住的房舍，在上次大雨中，很多倒塌，工人组长高志同同志即注意检查库房，发现一个存有一万斤槐子的库房漏的很凶，门道口亦往房内灌水。槐子是顶怕水的，高同志赶快回到工人宿舍，告大家说，当时就有工人齐新才等同志，立即动手，把槐子往一个相隔半里路的房内移。这消息传开后，全厂工人干部均参加了。当时正下着雨，街上积水半尺泥泞不堪。工人们光着膀子、赤着脚、抢着背。有的凑五六个人伙拉大车（雨大不能用牲口）。有的用小车推，有的背。工人齐新才腰疼了半个月，还正吃着药，尤振军腿上才因公受伤四天伤口还流水，也都参加了。有的背了七八次，每次均背一百廿斤。领导上怕大雨淋坏了人，劝大家停停，雨小些再背，但工人们坚持不休，一气把东西背完。
