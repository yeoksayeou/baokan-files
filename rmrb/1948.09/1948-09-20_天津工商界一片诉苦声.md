Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Under the Nationalist government's "currency reform" followed by "price controls" and "tax increases," Tianjin's industry and commerce have been severely impacted. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on August 28th, the complaints of people in Tianjin's business community included: (1) The selling price of finished products is uniformly pegged to the price on August 19th. However, the price of raw materials is not controlled. Raw material prices rise every day, but the price of finished products cannot be set according to cost, causing factories to suffer heavy losses. For example, on August 19th, a bale of 20-count yarn sold for 2.2 billion yuan, but the current price of cotton has risen to 500 million yuan per dan (unit of weight). According to cost calculations, each bale of yarn now loses 600 million yuan. (2) The price of imported equipment and raw materials has suddenly increased. Before the 19th, importers settled foreign exchange at a rate of 8 million legal tender per US dollar. After the "currency reform," the legal rate was 12 million legal tender per US dollar. In addition, import taxes have also increased, so the burden on raw materials and equipment needed by factories has increased by 55 percent compared to the past, while the finished products produced are sold at the original price. (3) The Nationalist government's banks have canceled industrial loans and switched to borrowing at high interest rates.

　　天津工商界一片诉苦声
    【新华社陕北十六日电】在国民党政府实行所谓“币制改革”后的“限价”和“增税”政策下，天津工商业受极大打击。据八月二十八日天津大公报披露天津工商界人士所陈诉的痛苦情形称：（一）成品出售价格一律照八月十九日价格钉住。但原料价格却未在管制之列。原料天天涨，成品不能依照成本订价，工厂赔累不堪。如八月十九日二十支纱一包售价二十二亿元，而目前棉花每担售价已涨达五亿元，照成本计算，则目前每包纱赔累六亿元之巨。（二）进口器材原料价格突增。十九日以前进口商结汇美元一元兑换法币八百万元，“币改”后美金一元合法币一千二百万元，加以进口税又有增加，因而各工厂所需要之原料器材进口较之过去增加负担百分之五十五，而所产成品则按原价销售。（三）国民党政府银行取消工业贷款，改为借款收高息。
