Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th -- According to an August 24th Tianjin Ta Kung Pao report: Xuzhou's industrial and commercial circles and various trade associations are opposing the Kuomintang government's extortionate taxes and levies. Under the Kuomintang government's oppression, the city's industry and commerce are becoming increasingly depressed. Factories and shops are already finding it difficult to bear the heavy business taxes of this spring and summer. The Kuomintang Jiangsu Provincial Government, however, claimed that the Xuzhou puppet municipal government and tax collection office were not "rectifying" matters effectively and ordered further extraction. They also increased the total business tax for the second half of the year to a staggering 100 billion "legal tender" per month. The city's puppet mayor even announced: "We are determined to use drastic measures to 'rectify' business tax collection." The collection office issued a notice forcing the chairmen of various trade associations to attend a meeting at the municipal government on August 16th to decide on collection issues, and threatened them with "reporting to the municipal government for deliberation" if they disobeyed. The chairmen and others were outraged and jointly drafted a telegram on the 15th, stating: "In recent years, the market has been extremely depressed and the economy is on the verge of collapse," while "tax collection is as urgent as a shooting star," and "the 'incompetent' chairmen of various industries are unable to cope." They unanimously declared their resignation, firmly refusing to attend the meeting, and replied to the collection office's threat, saying: "As for the matter of being punished for absence, we will leave it to your discretion." Afterwards, after the "mediation" of the Senate, it was decided to temporarily reduce the amount by half.

　　徐州工商业界
  　反对横征暴敛
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据八月二十四日天津大公报消息：徐州工商业各同业公会反对国民党政府之横征暴敛。该市工商业在国民党政府压榨下，日趋萧条，工厂商店对今年春夏两季苛重之营业税已难于负担。国民党江苏省政府却谓徐州伪市政府及税捐稽征处“‘整顿’不力”，饬令更进一步的榨取；并提高下半年营业税总额为每月“法币”一千亿元之巨。该市伪市长且宣布：“决以大刀阔斧手段，‘整顿’营业税收。”由稽征处发出通知强迫各同业公会理事长于八月十六日到市府开会，以决定征收问题，并以“违则呈请市府议处”相恫吓。理事长等群情激愤，遂于十五日联合草拟代电，略谓：“年来市面极度凋敝，经济濒于崩溃”，而“税收催科，急如星火”，“非‘低能’之各业理事长所能应付”，一致宣告辞职，坚决拒绝出席会议，且答复稽征处之恫吓称：“至于缺席议处一节，悉听尊便。”此后经过参议会“疏通”，决定暂定减半。
