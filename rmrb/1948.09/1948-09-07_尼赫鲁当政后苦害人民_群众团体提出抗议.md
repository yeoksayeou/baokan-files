Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: TASS Moscow, August 30th: Eighteen mass organizations in Delhi recently sent an open letter to Nehru, protesting the Indian government's policy of abolishing the people's democratic freedoms. The letter declared: The Indian people had hoped that under Nehru's rule, they would be liberated from the shackles of slavery, but the government's actions have destroyed this hope. The vast majority of the people are starving, the prices of major commodities and the fees for municipal utilities are constantly increasing, while wages remain at the same level. Freedom of speech has been deprived. The letter concluded: The working class, students, and youth are ready to fight for true peace and democracy.

　　尼赫鲁当政后苦害人民
  　群众团体提出抗议
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社莫斯科八月三十日讯：德里十八个群众团体顷致尼赫鲁公开信一封，抗议印度政府取消人民民主自由的政策。该函宣称：印度人民曾希望在尼赫鲁当政之后，能从奴隶束缚中解放出来，但政府的行动已毁灭了这一希望。绝大多数的人民正在挨饿，主要商品价格及市政公用事业的收费正在不断增加，而工资仍旧是原来的水平。言论自由已被剥夺。该函结语称：工人阶级、学生及青年已准备为争取真正的和平及民主而斗争。
