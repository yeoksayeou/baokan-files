Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th -- Comprehensive reports indicate that the Kuomintang reactionary government is currently conducting large-scale looting and robbery in various regions under its control, seizing gold, silver, foreign currency, and various supplies from the people. This kind of frantic robbery by the Kuomintang reactionaries has severely impacted not only the general working people and small and medium-sized merchants, but also managers of large stores and companies that are unrelated or have little relation to the four major families, who have become targets of their extortion and robbery. In the past half-month, the Kuomintang government, under the pretext of violating price control "laws," has arrested large numbers of merchants and vendors from various industries, including finance, jewelers, grain, department stores, food and beverage, stationery, pharmacies, shoes and hats, hotels, barbershops, and bathhouses, in cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Guiyang, Changsha, Chengdu, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, Xuzhou, and Kaifeng. According to incomplete statistics, nearly nine hundred people have been arrested. In Qingdao alone, more than two hundred people have been arrested; while in Shanghai, "police stations are filled with various victims of the government's economic cleansing. Most of the managers of Shanghai department stores are there, in addition to sixteen gold shop owners, seven shoe store owners, one hundred meat merchants, six warehouse managers, and countless street vendors, shop owners, and brokers of all sizes" (Associated Press, Shanghai, August 30th). The majority of these arrested merchants and vendors have been subjected to the Kuomintang gang's cruel extortion, and some have even been sent to "special criminal courts" for trial. Hungry wolves also pounced on former sworn brothers of their rogue president Chiang Kai-shek. According to the Central News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd, Du Weiping, head of Hongxing Securities, and son of Du Yuesheng, as well as Rong Hongyuan, head of Shenxin Textile Mill, Zhan Peilin, chairman of the Paper Industry Association, Wu Xilin, a major cotton cloth merchant, and Huang Yicong, general manager of Yongtaihe Tobacco Company, have been arrested one after another. The Chiang Kai-shek gang's propaganda department has also cooperated with these arrests, carrying out large-scale intimidation of the economic circles in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. In an editorial entitled "Shanghai This Week" issued on August 29th, it put forward the idea of "borrowing one or two heads to consecrate the blade" and "using severe penalties in chaotic times." Shanghai's CC's Zhengyan Daily also advocated that the best way to implement "currency reform" is to "borrow heads."

　　蒋匪公开进行大劫掠
    从人民手中夺取黄金白银外币物资
  　各行业大中小商人被捕者已近九百
    【新华社陕北八日电】综合各方消息：国民党反动政府，近日正在其统治区各地公开进行大规模的掳掠抢劫，从人民手中夺取黄金、白银、外币及各种物资。国民党反动派这类疯狂的抢劫，不但一般劳苦平民和中小商人受祸极深，即与四大家族无关或关系较少的大商店和大公司经理也成了他们勒索抢掠的对象。过去半个月内，国民党政府曾以所谓违反限制物价“法令”的罪名，在上海、南京、北平、天津、汉口、广州、南昌、杭州、贵阳、长沙、成都、西安、兰州、青岛、济南、徐州、开封等城市，大批逮捕包括金融、银楼、粮食、百货、饮食、文具、药房、鞋帽、旅馆、理发、浴室等各行业的商人、小贩，仅据不完全材料统计，即已近九百人。仅青岛一地，即有二百余人被捕；而上海方面，则“警察所挤满了政府经济清洗的各种牺牲品。大多数上海百货公司的经理都在那里，此外尚有十六个金店老板，七个鞋店老板，一百个肉商，六个货栈经理，和不计其数的夏季街上的小贩、商店老板、大小经纪人”（美联社上海八月三十日电）。这些被捕的人中占大多数的商人、小贩，都受到蒋家匪帮残酷的敲榨勒索，有的还被送到“特种刑庭”去受审。饥不择食的饿狼还扑向他们流氓总统蒋介石往日换帖拜把的同道。据中央社上海三日消息，鸿兴证券号负责人杜维屏，即杜月笙的儿子也和申新纱厂负责人荣鸿元，纸业公会理事长詹沛霖，棉布业巨商吴锡麟，永泰和烟行总经理黄以聪等人先后被捕。蒋匪中宣部并配合这种逮捕行动，对国民党统治区经济界大肆恫吓，在八月二十九日发出题为“上海一周”的社论中，提出“借一两颗人头祭刀”和“刑乱世用重典”的主张。上海ＣＣ的正言报也主张：实施“改革币制”的最好办法是“借人头”。
