Xinhua News Agency, North China, 2nd: Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, and Song Shaowen, Director of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee, reported to the North China Provisional People's Congress on August 9th on the work of the two border region governments. They detailed the great achievements made by the two regions in mobilizing the masses, supporting the war, implementing land reform, and developing production since the Japanese surrender.

Concerning Support for the War:

In the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, hundreds of thousands of young and middle-aged men have joined the army in the past two years, 99% of whom are peasants who have been emancipated after land reform and have a very high level of political awareness. Seven hundred thousand militiamen throughout the region cooperated with the main forces in combat. In the past year alone, they killed, wounded, and captured 38,395 enemy officers from brigade commander and regimental commander down. There has also been great progress in the economical use of civilian labor in war services, gradually reducing from five laborers per soldier at the beginning to one laborer per soldier. Now it is done with two or three soldiers per laborer. Most of the military families throughout the army have been properly taken care of in the equal distribution of land and burdens. In the past two years, more than 80,000 veterans have been given pensions and resettled.

In the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border region, hundreds of thousands of young and middle-aged men have also joined the army in the past two years and 500,000 militiamen have participated in front-line combat, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 20,000 enemy soldiers. The broad masses of people in the rear actively undertook war services and cultivated land on behalf of some military families. In addition to resettling more than 35,000 veterans, the government also organized veterans' management offices, established veterans' schools for education, and provided job referrals.

Concerning Land Reform:

In 1946, the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan region carried out a universal land reform and leveling-up movement. By March 1947, the old and semi-old areas with a population of 21.5 million, excluding the border guerrilla areas, had eliminated the feudal system. About 90% of the poor and hired peasants were allocated land and some floating property and means of production roughly equivalent to the average (the average obtained by dividing the total cultivated land area by the region's population). Only 10% of the poor and hired peasants, although they also received some land and property, had not yet obtained due satisfaction. Middle peasants generally maintained land above the average, and their production capital and tools were relatively abundant. Landlords and rich peasants generally had land equal to or slightly less than the average. After the autumn of last year, the entire region shifted to focusing on production while quickly resolving the small number of supplementary adjustments and correcting deviations. Due to the past lack of clear and specific instructions from the leadership on certain issues, the failure to deepen policy education, and the lack of timely inspection and understanding, left-leaning errors of varying degrees occurred in the later stages of land reform in various places, such as infringing on middle peasants and infringing on industry and commerce. After the review at the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China cadre meeting in November last year, resolute measures were taken to correct the deviations, strengthen ideological education to correct the policies among cadres and the masses, and promulgate various relatively specific and detailed deviation correction methods in accordance with the "Outline Land Law of China" and various policies of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. After several months of efforts, the deviations have been largely corrected and have entered a normal construction state.

In the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border region, after the Japanese surrender, the broad masses of people carried out an anti-traitor liquidation movement and voluntarily demanded land. In the year after May 1946, more than half of the farmers in the region participated in the movement to equally distribute land. After the review in May 1947, the land problem had been largely resolved in parts of Central Hebei, Jinbei and Chahar. In the autumn of last year, the Administrative Committee of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border region also passed a resolution to use the "Outline Land Law of China" as the land law of the border region. After the supplementary distribution from last winter to this spring, more than 90% of the areas with a population of 10,680,000 have largely achieved equal distribution of land, and only about 8% of the areas still need to continue supplementary distribution. The following deviations also occurred in the land reform: the leadership was impatient, and the merits and demerits of village cadres, the severity of the responsibility for making mistakes were not strictly distinguished in the land reform, and the education and persuasion of the masses were also insufficient. In the early stage of the movement, many middle peasants were wrongly designated as rich peasants and landlords, and after successive corrections, about 80% have been thoroughly or relatively well corrected so far, and the remaining 20% still need to be seriously corrected. At the same time, some industry and commerce were infringed, of which 92% have been thoroughly corrected, and the rest still need to be corrected.

Concerning Economic Construction:

After detailing the achievements of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region in increasing grain production, improving agricultural technology, planting trees, water conservancy, developing rural sideline industries, machine industries, transportation, finance, and trade in the past two years, Chairman Yang Xiufeng emphasized that due to grasping the correct implementation of the policy of developing agriculture, industry, and commerce during the intense war, prices have remained balanced in the past two years, and in foreign trade, there has been a surplus of 16.59 billion yuan in the past two years. Mistakes have also been made in production and construction, mainly formalism and coercion in agricultural production, such as the occurrence of organizing mutual aid and labor exchange without following the principles of voluntariness and equivalent value. In industrial production, the leadership lacked planning and experience, was not good at management, and had relief and egalitarian views on wage issues. All of these have been corrected or are being corrected.

In the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border region, Director Song Shaowen pointed out that the most successful aspect of agricultural production is water conservancy construction, and there has also been significant progress in breeding livestock, eliminating wasteland, and restoring and developing rural sideline industries. In the industrial sector, the machine industry has grown from small to large and is gradually developing towards modernization, but in general, there are still shortcomings such as high costs, poor quality, low technical level, high labor costs, large waste, and remnants of the supply system in the wage system, which must be greatly improved.

Concerning Culture and Education:

Chairman Yang said: In 1946 and the first half of 1947 in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, school education developed vigorously, and the North China United University and many middle schools and normal schools were established, training more than 5,000 cadres in various fields. In the second half of 1947, under the left-leaning influence of land reform and party rectification work, "three investigations" were carried out in schools, resulting in a serious phenomenon of reduced schools and students, and a decline in the cultural level of students. After the corrections since this year, according to recent reports from various places, the errors have been gradually corrected. Currently, there are 30 middle schools and normal schools with more than 7,000 students; 960 complete primary schools with more than 144,000 students; and 38,579 elementary schools with more than 2,234,400 students. In terms of social education, current affairs politics and some production education have been strengthened; literacy, hygiene, and breaking superstitions still need to be improved.

From 1946 to the spring of this year, the North China United University, Medical University, Industrial and Transportation College, and various middle schools in Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei have trained a total of more than 10,000 cadres. Currently, in addition to military schools and universities, there are 67 middle schools and normal schools with more than 11,000 students, 677 higher primary schools with more than 47,000 students; and 17,458 elementary schools with more than 1,089,400 students. Social education has also developed unprecedentedly, with civil schools, rooftop broadcasts, blackboards, and reading groups spreading throughout the vast countryside. Larger cities have civil education centers responsible for promoting urban social education. The problems that need to be solved in the cultural and educational fields at present include improving educational institutions, unifying and stipulating the guiding principles for running schools, as well as comprehensive plans for the school system, curriculum, etc., training teachers, and appropriately improving their treatment.

　　杨秀峰主席、宋劭文主任在华北临时人代会上
  　分别报告政府工作
  　支前土改生产两区均获巨大成绩
    【新华社华北二日电】晋冀鲁豫边区政府主席杨秀峰、晋察冀边区行政委员会主任委员宋劭文八月九日分别向华北临时人民代表大会报告两边区政府工作，详述两区自日本投降以来发动群众、支援战争、实行土改、发展生产所获得的巨大成绩。
    关于支援战争
    晋冀鲁豫全区两年来有数十万青壮年参军，其中百分之九十九系土改后翻身之农民，政治觉悟极高。全区七十万民兵配合主力作战，仅去年一年，毙伤俘敌旅长团长以下达三万八千三百九十五人。在战争勤务的节约使用民力上亦有极大进步，由开始时之一兵五夫逐渐减至一兵一夫，现在则做到二兵一夫或三兵一夫。全军军属，在平分土地和负担上多半得到适当照顾。两年来抚恤和安置荣誉军人八万余人。
    在晋察冀边区两年多来参军之青壮年亦有数十万人，民兵参加前线作战者达五十万，毙伤俘敌二万余。后方广大人民则积极负担战勤，并为部分军属代耕土地。除安置了三万五千余荣誉军人外，政府并组织了荣誉军人管理处，设立荣誉军人学校进行教育，并介绍工作。
    关于土地改革
    晋冀鲁豫一九四六年进行了普遍的土地改革及填平补齐运动，至一九四七年三月，除边沿区游击区外，全区拥有人口二千一百五十万的老区半老区已消灭了封建制度，贫雇农中百分之九十左右分得了大体相当于平均数（全区人口除耕地总面积所得的平均数）的土地及部分浮财和生产工具，只有百分之十的贫雇农虽亦分得了部分土地和财产，但尚未获得应有的满足。中农一般保持平均数以上的土地，生产资本及工具则比较优裕。地主富农土地一般等于或略少于平均数。去年秋后，全区即转入以生产为中心，同时迅速解决小部分的抽补调剂及纠正偏向问题。由于领导上过去对某些问题指示不够明确具体，政策教育未能深入，检查了解不够及时，土改后期各地曾发生程度不同的侵犯中农、侵犯工商业等左倾错误。经过去年十一月中共晋冀鲁豫中央局干部会议的检讨，坚决地采取了严肃的纠偏措施，在干部与群众中，加强端正政策的思想教育，并按照中国土地法大纲及中共中央各种政策，颁行各种比较具体详细的纠偏办法，经数月努力，偏向已大体纠正，进入正常建设状态。
    在晋察冀边区，日本投降后广大人民曾进行了反奸清算运动，并自动起来要求土地。从一九四六年五月以后的一年中，全区有半数以上农民参加了平分土地的运动。又经过一九四七年五月的复查，冀中、冀晋及察哈尔的部分地区，大体上已解决了土地问题。去年秋季，晋察冀边区行政委员会又通过决议，以中国土地法大纲为边区土地法。经过去冬今春的抽补，在一千零六十八万人口的地区，已有百分之九十以上地区大体实现了平分土地，只有约百分之八的地区尚须继续抽补。在土地改革中亦曾发生下列偏向：即领导上的性急，在土地改革中对村干部的功过大小、犯错误责任的轻重未严格区分，而对群众的教育说服亦不够。在运动初期曾把许多中农错订为富农、地主，后经陆续改正，至目前止改正得彻底和改正得较好的占百分之八十左右，还有百分之二十尚待继续认真纠正。同时也侵犯了某些工商业，其中百分之九十二已彻底纠正，其余仍待纠正。
    关于经济建设
    杨秀峰主席于详述晋冀鲁豫边区两年来增产粮食、提高农业技术、植树、水利、发展农村副业、机器工业、交通运输、金融贸易等各方面之成绩后，着重指出由于在紧张战争中抓紧正确执行发展农工商业之政策，二年来物价均保持平衡，在对外贸易上两年来出超一百六十五亿九千余万元。在生产建设上也曾犯过错误，主要是农业生产上的形式主义与强迫命令现象，如发生不按自愿、等价的原则组织互助变工。在工业生产中则是领导上缺乏计划与经验，不善经营，工资问题上有救济及平均主义的观点等。凡此均早已改正或正在改正。
    在晋察冀边区，宋劭文主任指出在农业生产中最有成绩的是水利建设，在繁殖牲畜，消灭熟荒，恢复与发展农村副业等方面亦有显著进步。在工业方面，机器工业由小而大，逐渐向近代化发展，但一般尚存在成本高、质量差、技术水平低、用人多、浪费大以及工资制度上的供给制残余等缺点，须大力改进。
    关于文化教育
    杨主席称：在晋冀鲁豫区一九四六年及一九四七年上半年，学校教育蓬勃发展，创办了北方大学及许多中学、师范，培养了五千多各方面的干部。一九四七年下半年，在土地改革和整党工作中的左倾影响之下，在学校里进行“三查”，以致发生学校与学生减少，学生文化程度降低的严重现象。经过今年以来的纠正，据最近各地报告，错误已逐渐改正，现全区共有中学、师范三十座，学生七千余人；完全小学九百六十座，学生十四万四千余人；初小三万八千五百七十九座，学生二百二十三万四千余人。在社会教育方面，时事政治及某些生产教育加强了；识字、卫生及破除迷信等教育则有待改进。
    晋察冀文化教育工作，自一九四六年至今年春季，华北联合大学、医科大学、工业交通学院以及各中学，总共培养出一万以上的干部。现全区除军事学校及大学外，有中学、师范六十七处，学生一万一千余人，高小六百七十七处，学生四万七千余人；初小一万七千四百五十八处，学生一百零八万九千余人。社会教育亦有空前发展，民校以及屋顶广播、黑板报、读报组等遍及广大农村，较大城市均设有民教馆，负责推动城市社会教育。目前文教方面尚待解决的问题则有健全教育机构，统一规定办理学校的方针以及学制、课程等的通盘计划，培养师资，适当提高其待遇等。
