　　Snippets of Soviet Agricultural Construction
    ★ In a region of Ukraine, previously considered to have infertile land and low yields, scientists, after researching and determining which fertilizers should be used for each type of sandy soil, have enabled collective farmers in the area to achieve an unprecedentedly high buckwheat harvest this year, exceeding past harvests by more than threefold.
    ★ This autumn, Soviet collective farms will plant trees on over 40,000 hectares of land to protect farmland from wind and water. This will allow crops to grow even in the driest grasslands.
    ★ The Soviet Union has begun small-scale autumn afforestation. In Georgia alone, collective farmers, workers, civil servants, and students planted six million trees on the "Afforestation Day" at the beginning of this month. This year, the total afforestation area in the Soviet Union will reach over 280,000 hectares. To support afforestation, factories have been producing various new tree planting machines in large quantities, and nurseries have been cultivating tree seedlings extensively.

　　苏联农业建设零讯
    ★过去认为土地贫瘠、产量不丰的乌克兰一个地区，经科学家研究结果，确定每一块砂质的土壤应使用什么肥料以后，该地集体农民今年已获得了空前高额的荞麦收获，比过去的收获量超过三倍以上。
    ★苏联集体农场今秋将在四万余公顷土地上种植树木保护农田，防风防水。这将使农作物甚至在最干燥的草原上都可以成长。
    ★苏联已开始小规模秋季造林。仅乔治亚一地，集体农民、工人、公务员与学生，在本月初的“造林日”即种树六百万株。本年全苏造林面积将达二十八万公顷以上。为了造林，各工厂已大量生产各种新式植树机，各苗圃已大量培养树苗。
