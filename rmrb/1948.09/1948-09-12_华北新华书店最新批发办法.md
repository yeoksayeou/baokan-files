New Wholesale Method of the North China Xinhua Bookstore

　　I. Any bookstores, cultural cooperatives, peddlers, etc. within our border region who are willing to sell books, magazines, and textbooks published or distributed by our store, as long as they genuinely sell and promote them, and frequently interact with our store to establish a cooperative agreement, will be handled according to these methods.

　　II. Each sales agency has only a buying and selling relationship with our store and cannot engage in external activities in the name of our store.

　　III. For all books, magazines, and textbooks published by our store, an 80% discount is offered for cash payment and self-pickup; an 85% discount is offered for cash payment and postal delivery by our store; an 85% discount is also offered for self-pickup, advance payment of 50% of the total value, and settlement at the end of the month.

　　IV. For all foreign books, magazines, and textbooks distributed by our store, an 85% discount is offered for cash payment and self-pickup; a 90% discount is offered for cash payment and postal delivery by our store.

　　V. If there are books or magazines with missing or misprinted pages, they can be returned to our store for exchange immediately. Books that have been shipped, except for textbooks and magazines, if they are indeed slow-selling, can be returned to our store at the original shipping price within three months, but not exceeding 20% of the number of books shipped. Books that are damaged, stained, or have pages missing to the point of being unsalable will not be accepted for return.

　　VI. This method will be implemented from the date of its announcement, and all previous wholesale methods will be invalidated.
　　Welcome Wholesale and Consignment!
