Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th -- According to various sources: Zhang Qun, the head of the Political Science Clique within the Kuomintang reactionaries and a well-known pro-Japanese figure, flew to Tokyo on the 21st of last month for a "visit" to Japan. MacArthur and Japanese reactionaries had repeatedly expressed their "welcome" beforehand. According to Central News Agency reports, Zhang Qun, on the second day of his arrival in Japan (22nd), paid his respects to his master MacArthur at noon. On the afternoon of the 25th, he met with Japanese reactionary government Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida and Vice Minister Aizawa. From the morning of the 26th, he successively met with the leaders of various Japanese reactionary parties, including Ken Inukai, advisor to the Democratic Party, Takeo Miki, Secretary-General of the National Cooperative Party, and Kijuro Shidehara of the Democratic Liberal Party. On the 31st, he paid a second visit to MacArthur at noon, holding talks for two hours. Late at night, he also met with Tetsu Katayama, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party. Zhang Qun repeatedly stated that his ugly behavior of colluding with MacArthur and the Japanese reactionaries was a "private inspection," but it is widely rumored that Zhang Qun's main purpose in visiting Japan is to further betray national independence and, under MacArthur's command, form a so-called "Sino-Japanese-Korean Anti-Communist Alliance." In addition to visiting Japan, Zhang Qun will also go to Korea and other places. Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 12th of last month, reported: "Well-informed sources announced that 'Zhang Qun's main purpose for this trip is to pave the way for the Sino-Japanese reconciliation and joint anti-communism of Asian countries that he advocates.'" Reuters, Nanjing, 12th, further quoted a conversation from an "anonymous senior government official" revealing that Zhang Qun's trip was to plan an "anti-communist alliance" or a so-called "regional group security." Associated Press, Shanghai, 9th of last month, reported that Zhang Qun's visit to Japan was "ordered" by the bandit Chiang. According to TASS, Nanjing, 29th of last month: when Zhang Qun held talks with MacArthur and representatives of the Japanese reactionary camp in Japan, "South Korean reactionaries also participated in these negotiations. It is generally believed here that these negotiations are supported by the US intelligence office."

　　进一步出卖国家民族独立
  　张群“访问”日本
  　在麦克阿瑟指挥下组织“反共同盟”
    【新华社陕北五日电】据各方消息：国民党反动派中政学系头子著名的亲日派张群，于上月二十一日飞往东京，“访问”日本。事先麦克阿瑟及日本反动派曾一再表示“欢迎”。据中央社连日报导：张群于抵日第二天（二十二日）中午，即叩见其主子麦克阿瑟。二十五日下午会见日本反动政府首相芦田均及外次芳泽。廿六日晨起接连会见日本各反动党派首领民主党顾问犬养健、国民协同党干事长三木武夫、民主自由党币原喜重郎等人。三十一日午第二次叩见麦克阿瑟，会谈两小时。深夜又会见社会民主党主席片山哲。张群对其与麦克阿瑟及日本反动派勾搭之丑行，一再声明系“私人性质之考察”，但各方盛传张群访日主要目的，在于进一步出卖国家民族独立，在麦克阿瑟指挥下，组成所谓“中日韩反共同盟”。张群除访日外，并将赴朝鲜等地。法新社上月十二日南京电称：消息灵通人士宣布：“张群此行主要目的，为铺平走向他所主张的中日和睦与亚洲国家共同防共的道路”。路透社南京十二日电更引证某“匿名的政府高级官员”谈话透露：张群此行即在筹划“反共同盟”或所谓“区域集团安全”。美联社上月九日上海消息则称，张群访日系蒋贼所“授命”。又据塔斯社上月二十九日南京消息：张群在日本与麦克阿瑟及日本反动阵营代表进行会谈时，“南朝鲜反动派亦参加这些谈判。此间一般认为这些谈判系由美情报处所支持”。
