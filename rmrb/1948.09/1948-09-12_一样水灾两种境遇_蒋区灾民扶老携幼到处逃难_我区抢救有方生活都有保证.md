(Taihang Dispatch) River floods are rampant, and the water disaster is severe. The disaster victims in the liberated areas of northern Henan and the areas ruled by the Kuomintang are experiencing two extremely different situations. When the river water rose sharply in late last month and the banks burst, the cadres of democratic governments at all levels in the Fourth and Fifth Administrative Regions of northern Henan braved the rain and water, led the masses to forcibly block the breaches, eliminated the pessimistic mood of the masses, and organized support from the non-disaster areas. Finally, within a short period of less than a week, they blocked all of the hundreds of breaches in the Qin River, Mang River, Guangji River, Yunliang River, Zhang River, Qi River, Anyang River, Dan River, Fuyang River, and Wei River within the borders of Xiuwu, Bo'ai, Jiaozuo, Wen County, Qinyang, Xinxiang, Ji County, Hui County, Qi County, Zhangnan, Ye County, and Anyang. The county magistrate and county secretary of Zhangnan County personally led the work, and nineteen breaches were closed within seven or eight days. A total of 30,000 civilian laborers were mobilized, costing nearly 20 million yuan and 180,000 jin of wheat. The Sixth District of the county also awarded 10,000 jin of wheat to those who were exemplary in blocking the breaches and repairing the dikes. At the same time, a large amount of relief grain and loans were distributed to urgently relieve the disaster victims, and they were organized to engage in production for self-salvation. The Fifth Administrative Office allocated 50,000 jin of grain, and the severely affected areas of Jiaozuo Xiuwu also provided loans of nearly 10 million yuan and more than 6,000 jin of grain. On August 2, the Fourth Administrative Office also held a meeting to inspect the flood control and disaster relief work, and assigned cadres to go to the countryside to carry out disaster relief work. In addition to planting turnips and other autumn vegetables on more than 40,000 mu of flooded land in the Sixth and Ninth Districts of Hui County, the masses were also mobilized to open up more than 30 hectares of ripe wasteland in Luozhuang and other villages, most of which were also planted with autumn vegetables. Loans of 45 million yuan were issued to organize disaster victims to engage in sideline production such as livestock trading, weaving, and saltpeter boiling. Through active rescue and relief, more than 500,000 disaster victims in northern Henan were given a way out. The disaster victims said with emotion: "The Communist Party and the democratic government are really our saviors. If the government hadn't led us to block the river breaches, we wouldn't have our lives." Now, while carrying out production for self-salvation, the river dikes are being consolidated to prevent further flooding. The disaster victims in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, who suffered the same disaster, are displaced and dying in the rolling floodwaters. The Chiang Kai-shek party personnel sit idly by. The masses in the Kuomintang-controlled areas on the south bank of the Dan River in Xinxiang saw that the people in the liberated areas on the north bank were actively rescuing the flood under the leadership of the democratic government, and said painfully: "When a breach occurs, people (referring to the democratic government) think of ways to block the water and provide loans for relief; no one cares about us here!" Helpless, they fled to the liberated areas with the old and the young. Only 680 people fled to the Ninth District of Hui County and the First and Fifth Districts of Xiuwu. The democratic government gave them warm condolences and resettled them. After the Mulandi Qin River Bridge was destroyed by the Chiang bandits in mid-June last year, although our army and civilians rushed to repair it, it could not be repaired due to repeated obstruction by the Chiang bandits. This time, the Qin River breached again from here. Forty-two villages within thirty miles around Xiuwu City and forty miles from east to west in the Kuomintang-controlled area suffered, and nearly 10,000 people were affected. In Xiaohan Village, which has less than 100 people in total, more than 60 people were washed away by the flood. The disaster victims in Changqiao did not eat for three days on the branches of trees. The local disaster victims gathered more than 200 people, holding pitchforks and iron shovels, crossed the Qin River and arrived at the West Gate of Xiuwu City, demanding that the puppet county magistrate Xu Jingshan exempt them from grain and conscription and provide relief to the people, but Xu stood on the city tower and prevaricated the disaster victims. More than 100 disaster victims in Huaifeng Township, forced by hunger, angrily spread the word: "It's death if we don't starve, anyway, we'll risk our lives to fight the dog people (referring to the Chiang puppets)." They crowded outside the village, demanding relief from the puppet township chief Guo Qinghe. Guo ignored them. The disaster victims angrily broke into the township office and robbed all the rice and flour.

　　一样水灾两种境遇
    蒋区灾民扶老携幼到处逃难
  　我区抢救有方生活都有保证
    【太行电】河洪泛滥，水灾深重。豫北解放区和国民党统治区的灾民，经遇着两种极不同的境遇。当上月下旬，河水暴涨，决堤时，我豫北四、五分区各级民主政府干部，即冒雨涉水，率领群众强行堵口，扫除群众悲观情绪，组织非灾区群众支援，终在不满一周的短促时间内，将修武、博爱、焦作、温县、沁阳、新乡、汲县、辉县、淇县、漳南、邺县、安阳境内之沁河、漭河、广济河、运粮河、漳河、淇河、安阳河、丹河、滏阳河、卫河等上百处决口，全部堵住。漳南县长、县书亲自领导，十九处决口在七八天内即告堵竣。共动用民力三万个，费洋近两千万，麦子十八万斤。该县六区并以一万斤小麦，奖励了堵口修堤的模范者。同时并发放大批救济粮、贷款急赈灾民，和组织其生产自救。计五专署即拨粮五万斤，焦作修获武严重地区亦贷款近千万元，粮食六千多斤。四专署于八月二日又召开会议，检查治水救灾工作，分派干部下乡进行救灾工作。辉县六、九区除将四万余亩被淹田地种上蔓菁等秋菜外，并发动群众到罗庄等村开熟荒三十余顷，亦大部种上秋菜。发放贷款四千五百万元，组织灾民贩牲口、纺织、熬硝等副业生产。经过积极的抢堵救济，豫北五十万以上的灾民得到了生路，灾民感动的说：“共产党、民主政府真是咱的救命恩人，要不是政府带领咱堵河口，哪里还有咱的命在。”现在对群众一面进行生产自救，一面继续巩固河堤，防止再泛。遭受同样灾难的国民党统治区灾民，即在黄水滚滚的灾难里流离失所，奄奄待毙。蒋党人员坐视不理。新乡丹河南岸国民党统治区群众，看到北岸解放区人民在民主政府领导下积极抢救水灾，痛心的说：“冲开口人家（指民主政府）想法堵水，又贷款救济；咱这里谁管哩！”无奈何即扶老携幼纷纷逃来解放区，仅逃到辉县九区与修武一、五区的即有六百八十人。民主政府当热情慰问安置。去年六月中旬木栾店沁河大桥被蒋匪破坏后，虽经我军民抢修，但因蒋匪一再阻扰，未能修筑，此次沁河又从此处决口，国民党统治区修武城周卫北三十里，东西四十里之四十二个村，近万人民遭难。小韩村一共不到一百口人，即被水冲走六十多口。常桥灾民在树枝上三天未吃饭，当地灾民集合二百余人，手持杈把铁锹渡过沁水，到达修武城西关，要求伪县长徐景山，免除派粮派丁，救济国民，但徐却高踏城楼支吾灾民。怀封乡灾民百余人为饥饿所逼，愤怒相传：“不饿也是死，反正冒着死跟狗人（指蒋伪）拼一下。”齐拥寨外，要求伪乡长郭清河救济，郭不理，灾民一怒打进了乡公所，把米面全部抢去。
