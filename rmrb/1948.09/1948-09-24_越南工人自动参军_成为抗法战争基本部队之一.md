　　Vietnamese Workers Voluntarily Enlist
  　Becoming One of the Basic Forces in the Anti-French War
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] TASS reports citing the Vietnam News Agency: Vietnamese workers who voluntarily join the guerrillas have now become one of the basic forces in the Vietnamese resistance war. Even in towns temporarily occupied by the French army, trade unions are waging a relentless war against the colonial oppressors. The number of mercenaries and European soldiers in the French army defecting to the Vietnamese army is increasing daily: in the first six months of 1948 alone, 1,000 mercenaries and 200 European soldiers in northern Vietnam voluntarily surrendered, bringing with them large quantities of weapons and ammunition.

　　越南工人自动参军
  　成为抗法战争基本部队之一
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社引越南新闻社讯：自动参加游击队的越南工人现已成为越南抵抗战争中的基本部队之一。甚至在被法军暂时占领的城镇中，职工会都在对殖民压迫者进行无情的战争。法军中雇佣兵与欧籍兵投诚到越军的数目正与日俱增：在一九四八年头六个月中，仅在越南北部即有一千名雇佣兵与两百名欧籍兵自动投降，并携来大量武器与弹药。
