    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 24th] The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government recently issued a notice commending the Ningtai Guerrilla Unit of the Western Shaanxi Sub-district and awarded the organizers and leaders of the unit, Su Zhi, Zhao Yanfang, and Yang Guangyao, a New Democracy Medal each. The unit was established at the end of last year. Due to mastering the correct line of army building, it quickly developed into a strong people's armed force, stubbornly operating behind enemy lines on both sides of the Jing River. Recently, it successively repelled more than ten enemy attacks in the Yongshou area, completely crushing the enemy's plan to seize grain and conscript soldiers in the area, and carried out mass work locally. The circular called on local corps, local armed forces, and personnel working in enemy areas to learn from the unit.
