[Taihang Telegram] The intense struggle to protect the autumn harvest has begun in northern Henan. Hui County and Ye County started their autumn harvest in late August. Local armed forces have also proactively extended their activities to the front-line areas and have promoted the experience of "holding a gun in one hand and a sickle in the other" from the wheat protection campaign to help the masses with the harvest. A unit of the Hui County Brigade, with extremely high morale after the democratic movement, advanced to the area around the city to strike the enemy and carry out political offensives, covering the masses' harvest. This unit operated as close as one li from the city, near the west and south gates, and slogans were written all over the villages. During operations in the Liulin area, they specifically set aside time during their afternoon nap to wholeheartedly help the masses with the harvest, which was warmly supported by the local people. The city gate and Ninth District militia rotation teams of the county have achieved continuous victories in the autumn harvest protection campaign. On the night of August 23rd, more than 100 enemies from the city surrounded Liudian Village to seize grain. The Zhuoshui joint defense militia discovered them and opened fire. The Liulin joint defense ×× militia, working team, and the Second Battalion of the battalion soldiers rushed to support them. The Zhuqiao militia self-defense team also ambushed the enemy along the road. In this joint defense operation, two enemies were wounded. On the same night, more than 100 enemies from Xiuwu came out to seize recruits and livestock, but were defeated by our Ninth District militia rotation team at Wuliyuan, capturing two enemies, seizing two rifles, and 50 rounds of ammunition. On the night of the 24th, the enemy went to Changwu and set up camp, seizing five head of livestock and taking away six people from the masses. The militia rotation team heard about this and rushed to attack. The enemy fled in panic, and all the livestock were intercepted, and five people from the masses were freed. In addition to issuing a circular of commendation, the county headquarters specifically awarded the combat militia 200 rounds of ammunition, 50 hand grenades, and 20 artillery shells. The Ninth District militia rotation team was awarded 400 rounds of ammunition and 20 small artillery shells. When a unit of the Ye County Brigade was operating in Wang'an Village, they also took time to help two households harvest more than ten mu of sorghum.

[Taihang Telegram] In order to proactively welcome the autumn harvest protection struggle, the Yingbing unit of Xiuwu, northern Henan, after a sixty-li forced march on August 31st, crossed a thirty-li desert area, and unexpectedly attacked the enemy's forward stronghold of Huanfeng (more than ten li southeast of Xiuwu city). After a forty-minute battle, the defending enemy, the puppet township armed forces, were completely annihilated, except for more than 20 people who escaped over the walls. Huanfeng was immediately captured by us. It is estimated that more than 20 enemies were wounded, and 51 puppet company commanders and soldiers below were captured. One small cannon, four light machine guns, and 51 rifles were seized. We only suffered one injury. The Taihang Military Region Headquarters specifically issued a commendation order on September 5th.
