[Taihang Dispatch] The Yan bandit gang in Taiyuan, an isolated island surrounded by our People's Liberation Army, is in a state of panic, and soldiers are deserting in droves. Since August, groups of three to five Yan soldiers have been defecting to our army positions every day. According to Li Renyi, a soldier from the 6th Company of the Yan bandit's 44th Division's Replenishment Regiment who defected, more than half of the 40-plus men in the company had already run away, and those who remained were afraid of being killed and would run out of the camp at night. Speaking of the situation in Taiyuan, he said: The Yan bandits in Taiyuan are living in constant fear, not knowing when the People's Liberation Army will attack. After the 44th Division was wiped out by the People's Liberation Army, only the sick and wounded and more than 300 "People's Defense Army" soldiers remained. Now they are still called the 44th Division, just like a bankrupt shop, with a sign but no goods. Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's planes are constantly transporting away factory machinery, which is making people even more panicked. Prices are rising several times a day. Now a cigarette costs 100,000 yuan, and private businesses are closing their doors. The people are eating soybean cakes and are hoping that the People's Liberation Army will liberate them quickly. He said: Yan's bandits earn 830,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency a day as privates, which is not even enough to buy a box of Truman cigarettes. They don't get enough to eat every day, and they have to tighten their belts to build fortifications. Their quilts are all lightly packed and taken to the city. They sleep in the fortifications at night, and at least six or seven out of ten people have scabies. The officers don't let the soldiers run away, but they all shave their heads and prepare plain clothes.

After Tian Fuchang, a platoon leader of the 1st Company of the Yan bandit's 2nd Machine Gun Regiment, defected to us, he said: Don't say the new recruits are scared, I've been a soldier for eight years and I'm just as scared. My platoon has run away completely in the last ten days or so. Seven of us ran away together the day before yesterday. The company commander and battalion commander can't do anything about it, and those "iron army backbone" members can't monitor them either. As long as the brothers have a chance, they give each other a look, and then they run away. The officers eat and drink all day long, saying, "Eat up, you won't get to eat it if you get killed when the Eighth Route Army comes." Many students have been forced into the army. In the past, students had to undergo half a year of training, but now they are sent to the troops after only half a month. Do you think they can fight? Now eight out of ten soldiers in the army are new recruits, and they have no combat effectiveness. He said: I know Taiyuan very well. When attacking Taiyuan, I can lead the way. Those dogs [expletive] are useless and will collapse with one blow.

　　太原阎匪成天提心吊胆士兵成群跑来向我投诚
    【太行电】在我人民解放军团团围困下的太原孤岛，阎匪恐慌万状，士兵逃跑成风。八月以来，每天都有三五成群的阎兵跑来我军阵地投诚。据阎匪四十四师补充团六连投诚士兵李仁义说：该连四十多人已经跑了一多半，留下的都怕被打死，夜里就跑出营盘。谈到太原情况，他说：太原阎匪成天提心吊胆，不知道人民解放军哪时要进攻。四十四师被解放军消灭后，只剩病号和“民卫军”三百多人，现在还叫四十四师，就象垮了台的店铺一样，有招牌没有货。蒋阎飞机成天运走工厂机器，人心更加慌乱。物价一天涨好几回。现在一根纸烟十万元，私人生意都关了门。老百姓吃的是豆饼，都盼望解放军赶快解放他们。他说：阎匪二等兵一日赚八十三万蒋币，还买不了一盒杜鲁门牌香烟。每天吃不饱，束紧腰带修工事，被子都轻装到城里去了，夜间在工事里睡觉，十个人至少有六、七个生疥疮。当官的不让士兵跑，他们却都推光平头，准备好了便衣。
    阎匪机二团一连排长田福昌向我投诚后说：不要说新兵害怕，我当了八年的老兵也是一样。我排这十来天都跑光了，前天和我一路跑过来的有七个，连长营长没办法，那些“铁军基干”也监视不了。兄弟们只要有机会，丢个眼色，跟着就跑了。当官的成天大吃大喝，都说“吃吧，八路军一来，打死了就吃不到了。”好些学生被逼着当了兵。过去学生要经半年训练，现在只半个月就分送到部队里去了，你说那能打仗吗？现在部队十个有八个是新兵，没有战斗力。他说：太原我很熟，打太原时我去领路，那狗＠的不顶事，一打就垮了。
