(Taiyue Electric) The Pingyao Municipal Democratic Government has absorbed a large number of intellectuals to participate in various tasks. In early August, the municipal government held two meetings for teachers on the job and unemployed intellectuals, with a total of more than 400 people attending. After discussing current affairs and various policies of the Communist Party, everyone had a relatively clear understanding of the Communist Party and the democratic government, and expressed their willingness to participate in the work of democratic construction. Mr. Wei Ding, who served as the director of studies at Taiyuan Xinmin Middle School before the war, painfully recounted the depression and danger of teachers' lives under the rule of the Yan bandit, and then excitedly said: "I am determined to engage in education in the liberated areas." More than a dozen young men and women also joined the government and bank work on the spot. The remaining 340 people also expressed their willingness to dedicate themselves to the democratic cause in the liberated areas. The government then appointed them as teachers in primary and secondary schools. The three senior primary schools and most of the primary schools outside the city have already started. The five senior primary schools and Pingyao Middle School in the city are also preparing to start school in the near future.

　　平遥大批知识分子参加各项民主建设
    【太岳电】平遥市民主政府大量吸收知识分子参加各种工作。八月初，市府两次召开在职教员及失业知识分子会议，共到四百余人，经过座谈时事和讨论共产党的各种政策，大家对共产党及民主政府都有了比较明确的认识，纷纷表示愿意参加民主建设工作。战前曾任太原新民中学教务主任的卫定先生痛述在阎匪统治下，教员生活的苦闷与危险，接着兴奋的说：“我决意在解放区从事教育工作”。另有十余名男女青年亦当场参加了政府和银行工作。其余三百四十余人，亦表示愿献身解放区民主事业。政府当分别委任为初高级小学教员。现城外的三个高小和大部小学，已经开学。城内的五个高小及平遥中学，亦准备最近期间开学。
