　　【Jinnan Telegram】Pests in Jinnan have spread from fourteen counties to thirty-one counties. Many crops have been eaten or gnawed to death, causing significant losses to the autumn harvest. Currently, the entire Jinnan region is carrying out a pest control campaign through ideological mobilization and organizational guarantees. At the beginning of the campaign, the masses had thoughts of superstitious belief in fate, fear of harming seedlings while killing insects, pessimism and paralysis, and the idea of "sweeping only the snow in front of one's own door." In response to the above-mentioned thoughts of the masses, cadres in various places used the facts of pest control and harm reduction to carry out propaganda and education among the masses, and led village cadres to take the lead in demonstrating, so as to enhance the masses' confidence in pest control. Then the masses were organized to capture and kill pests collectively or dispersedly, and a pest control campaign was launched everywhere. Two old women in Wulichang Village, En County, did not go to kill insects themselves, but went door-to-door to collect incense paper to pray at the temple. As a result, the insects in other people's fields were gradually reduced by killing, while the crops in their fields were almost eaten by insects because they were not killed. This fact not only educated her, but also educated the masses. Crickets were rampant in the first district of Pingxiang, and these insects came out at night to eat crops and hid during the day. Many people believed that this insect was not as easy to kill as grasshoppers, and expressed a lack of confidence. Some were even afraid of trampling on crops and deliberately emphasized that they could not be killed. After the district cadres led the village cadres and activists to kill the insects in a field, the masses' thinking was cleared. Then, the masses in each village actively started fighting. Locust plagues were found in Aicun in the second district. Most of the masses were willing to fight, but they were afraid of trampling on the crops. When the mobilization to capture and kill was launched, they all refused to fight in their own fields. After mobilizing the masses for discussion and formulating discipline, they divided into shifts according to plots to fight. As a result, the fighting was fast and did not trample on the crops. Therefore, the masses asked to fight in their own fields first. After two days of capture and killing in the village, most of the locusts were eliminated. Aixin Village formed a team of one person from each household to fight in the fields where the insect disaster was the most serious, and the remaining people were scattered in the fields where there were fewer insects. It was stipulated that each person must hand in one jin of insects every day. This could not only concentrate efforts to destroy the areas where the insect disaster was serious, but also kill insects in their own fields. The masses were very willing, and 760 men, women and children were mobilized to capture 1,698 jin of insects in one day.

　　打破迷信侥幸心理冀南继续捕灭害虫
    【冀南电】冀南各地害虫已由十四个县发展到三十一个县。不少庄稼被吃光咬死，秋收大受损失。目前冀南全区，正以思想动员，组织保证，开展捕虫运动。运动开始时，群众思想上存在着迷信命运，打虫怕毁苗，和悲观麻痹，以及各扫门前雪的思想。针对群众以上思想情况，各地干部拿捕虫免害的事实，对群众进行了宣传教育，并率领村干部带头示范，以提高群众打虫信心。然后将群众组织起来，集体或分散捕打，到处展开捕虫运动。恩县五里长屯两个老太太，她自已不去打虫，还挨门敛香纸到庙上去祷告。结果别人地里的虫子打的日渐显少，她们地里的虫子因没打，庄稼几乎被虫快吃光了。这种事实不但教育她本人，而且也教育了群众。平乡一区蟋蟀成灾，此虫晚上出来吃庄稼，白天就藏起来。不少群众都认为该虫不如蚂蚱好打，表示没信心。有的还怕踏毁庄稼故意强调不能打。经区干领导村干和积极分子在一块地里将该虫捕灭后，才搞通了群众思想。然后，各村群众都积极打起来。二区艾村发现蝗灾，大多数群众本来愿意打，就是怕踏毁庄稼。当发动捕打时，都拒绝打自己地里的，经发动群众讨论，订出纪律，按地块分班排打，结果打的又快，并没有踏毁庄稼，于是群众纷纷要求先打自己地里的。全村经两天捕打，蝗虫大部消灭。艾辛庄以每户一人组成队，到虫灾最严重的地里去打，下剩的人分散在虫少的地里打，并规定每人每日须交一斤虫，这样既可集中力量，将虫灾严重的地方歼灭，又可在自己地里打虫，群众都很愿意，男女老幼动员起来七百六十名，一天内捕虫达一千六百九十八斤。
