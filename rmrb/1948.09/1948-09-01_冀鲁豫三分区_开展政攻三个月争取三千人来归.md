Jiluyu Third Military District

Launching a Three-Month Political Offensive to Win Over 3,000 People
[Jiluyu Telegram] The Jiluyu Third Military District has launched a political offensive with remarkable results. In three months, it has won over 3,568 fugitive households, puppet soldiers, and personnel from puppet organizations. Yutai County originally had 875 fugitive households. Since we launched the propaganda offensive in mid-April, 466 households have returned. After the wife and children of landlord Zhang Fugang (former village chief) from Bailou Village, Shan County, returned home, the village gave them 20 jin of wheat, five mu of land, and some cotton wadding to engage in production. She also admitted her past mistakes at a meeting and was very grateful for the government and the people's arrangements. Under the influence of our Party's lenient policy, more and more fugitive households are returning home. Recently, Yutai won over two groups of bandits, one with a squad and the other with more than 50 people, bringing with them one machine gun and more than 50 rifles.

  　开展政攻三个月争取三千人来归
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫三分区开展政治攻势，成绩卓著。三个月争取逃亡户、伪军、伪组织人员三千五百六十八人来归。鱼台县原有逃亡户八百七十五户，从四月中旬我开展宣传攻势起，现已回来四百六十六户；单县白楼村地主张福广（旧保长）的媳妇小孩回家后，村里给他二十斤麦子、五亩地和一部分棉絮，叫她进行生产。她也在大会上承认了过去的错误，对政府与群众的安置非常感激。在我党宽大政策的影响下，逃亡户回家的日多。鱼台在最近争取了两股土匪武装，一股有一个班，一股五十多人，并带来机枪一挺、步枪五十余支。
