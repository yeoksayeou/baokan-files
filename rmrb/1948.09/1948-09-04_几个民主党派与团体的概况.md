　　Overview of Several Democratic Parties and Groups

　　Question: On this year's May 1st Labor Day, our Party issued the May 1st Slogan, in which the fifth point advocated: "All democratic parties, people's organizations, and social notables should promptly convene a political consultative conference to discuss and realize the convocation of a people's representative assembly and the establishment of a democratic coalition government." On May 5th, all democratic parties and groups telegraphed Chairman Mao to express their support. What is the overview of these democratic parties and groups?

　　Answer: The following is a brief introduction to the democratic parties and groups that telegraphed Chairman Mao on May 5th to support the convening of a new political consultative conference:

　　Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

　　The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was formally established in Hong Kong on New Year's Day, 1948. Prior to this, some members of the Kuomintang who opposed Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship had broken away from the Kuomintang and established separate organizations. These included the Chinese Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association led by Li Jishen and Cai Tingkai, and the Three People's Principles Comrades Association led by He Xiangning, Liu Yazi, and Tan Pingshan. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was a unified leading body formed by these two organizations and other anti-Chiang Kuomintang members such as Feng Yuxiang and Zhu Xuefan. When the committee was established, it issued a declaration and action program, declaring that "the foreign and domestic policies decided by the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang are the basic principles," advocating that the policy of alliance with Russia, cooperation with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants should be expanded to include "uniting with all nations in the world that treat us equally," "uniting with all democratic parties in the country," and "land to the tillers." At the same time, it advocated "overthrowing Chiang" and "opposing the United States" to establish a democratic coalition government.

　　China Democratic League

　　The predecessor of the China Democratic League was the United Association for National Construction, established in January 1940. In March 1941, it was renamed the Democratic League of Political Groups. Participants included the National Salvation Association, the Third Party (later renamed the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party), the China Vocational Education Society, the Rural Reconstruction Faction, the Northeast Revolutionary Comrades Association, the National Socialist Party (later renamed the Democratic Socialist Party), the Youth Party, and individual league members such as Zhang Yimin and Liu Yazi, and Zhang Lan. It was not until September 1945 that it was called by its current name. Before the 1946 Political Consultative Conference, the Youth Party defected to Chiang Kai-shek and withdrew from the Democratic League. The following year, in January, the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League expelled another reactionary organization, the Democratic Socialist Party. Since the Political Consultative Conference, they have advocated stopping the civil war and implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. League members Wen Yiduo, Li Gongpu, and Du Binzhang were all murdered by Chiang Kai-shek for opposing the civil war and opposing the dictatorship. In November 1946, Chiang Kai-shek convened a puppet National Assembly, and in the spring of 1947, the puppet government was reorganized, and they all refused to participate. In November, the Kuomintang government announced the dissolution of the Democratic League, and on November 5th, the League's chairman, Zhang Lan, announced the "automatic dissolution" of the Democratic League. Soon after, another group of leaders of the League, such as Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, and Zhou Xinmin, fled to Hong Kong and, together with their southern leaders such as Deng Chumin, Peng Zemin, and Shen Zhiyuan, held the Third Plenary Session in January 1948, rebuilt the leadership structure, and issued a declaration, putting forward four propositions: "First, under the current situation, it is impossible to achieve China's peace and democracy through negotiations and compromises; second, oppose the entire group representing landlords, local bullies, compradores, and feudalism, and thoroughly implement land reform, so that industry and commerce can prosper; third, oppose the United States' policy of aggression against China and do not recognize any treaties that harm the interests of the Chinese people; fourth, be willing to cooperate with all democratic parties to create a strong democratic united front. The Chinese Communist Party is the vanguard of democracy, and its history of struggle is worthy of the respect of every patriotic Chinese. This League is willing to work hand in hand with them."

　　China Association for Promoting Democracy

　　The China Association for Promoting Democracy was established in Shanghai during the 1946 Political Consultative Conference. It was composed of a group of scholars, writers, and industrialists from Shanghai, and its leaders were Ma Xulun and Wang Shao'ao. On June 23, 1946, representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai went to Nanjing to petition against the civil war and advocate peace. 50,000 to 60,000 Shanghai citizens saw them off at the station. They arrived in Nanjing that evening and were beaten by Kuomintang secret agents at the Xiaguan Railway Station. Most of the representatives were leading members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy.

　　Chee Kung Party

　　The Hongmen was an organization that opposed the Qing Dynasty and sought to restore the Ming Dynasty during the Manchu Qing Dynasty. After the failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution, Hongmen leader Yang Fuqing went to the Americas and founded the Hongmen Association. In March 1944, the New York Hongmen Association convened the All-American Hongmen Relatives and Friends Conference, which decided to change the American Chee Kung Tong into the Chinese Hongmen Chee Kung Party. Its主張s were "to realize the integrity of territorial sovereignty externally, and to abolish one-party dictatorship and realize democratic politics internally." In 1946, the party leader Situ Meitang returned to China and planned to organize the Hongmen Chee Kung Party in Shanghai, but was opposed by the Shanghai gangs. Situ Meitang then announced his withdrawal from the party. The current leader is Chen Qiyou.

　　Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party

　　The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, commonly known as the Third Party, was originally the Chinese Revolutionary Party, established in Shanghai after Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal in 1927. In January 1930, it was formally organized as a party and renamed the Provisional Action Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. Deng Yanda, who was killed by Chiang Kai-shek, was the leader of the party at that time. In the winter of 1933, the party leaders participated in the Fujian People's Government incident. After the failure, it was reorganized in 1935 and renamed the Chinese National Liberation Action Committee. In February 1947, it was renamed its current name. Its current political主張s are: 1. Support the Democratic League and realize democracy; 2. Struggle together with workers and peasants across the country; 3. Implement "land to the tillers" and improve the lives of workers and peasants; 4. Oppose the aggression of American imperialism and the civil war of aiding Chiang, and ensure China's independence and autonomy. The leaders of the party are Zhang Bojun and Peng Zemin.

　　China National Salvation Association

　　Since the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, the Chiang Kai-shek government has consistently implemented a policy of national betrayal and surrender to Japan, which has aroused the resolute opposition of the people across the country. In 1935, students in Peiping (now Beijing) took the lead and launched the great "December 9th" anti-Japanese movement. All parts of the country responded one after another. The Shanghai cultural circles united with all walks of life to establish the Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation Association. On May 30, 1936, they convened national representatives in Shanghai and established the National All-Circles National Salvation Association Federation, electing Ma Xiangbo (deceased), Shen Junru, Zou Taofen (deceased), Tao Xingzhi (deceased), Zhang Naiqi and other thirty-five people as executive members. This is the predecessor of the China National Salvation Association. The association's founding declaration responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party's "August 1st Declaration," demanding immediate resistance to Japan, "stopping all civil wars," and "rapidly establishing a national united front." In 1936, Shen Junru, Zou Taofen, Sha Qianli, Li Gongpu, Wang Zaoshi, Zhang Naiqi, and Shi Liang were arrested and imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government for advocating unity against foreign aggression, and were known as the "Seven Gentlemen." They were released after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. In 1938, Shen Junru led the organization of the National War of Resistance and National Construction Promotion Association, which was persecuted by the Kuomintang. In 1939, it restored its old name, and soon joined the United Association for National Construction and the Democratic League of Political Groups, and has always been the backbone of the Democratic League. After Japan's surrender, it changed to its current name. Since 1946, the association has consistently supported the Political Consultative Conference line and opposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' anti-people policies of dictatorship, civil war, and national betrayal. The current leaders are Shen Junru and Li Zhangda.

　　几个民主党派与团体的概况
    问：今年五一劳动节，我党发布了五一口号，其中第五项主张：“各民主党派、各人民团体及社会贤达，迅速召开政治协商会议，讨论并实现召集人民代表大会，成立民主联合政府”。五月五日各民主党派及团体即致电毛主席表示拥护。这些民主党派及团体的概况如何？
    答：兹将五月五日致电毛主席拥护召开新政治协商会议的各民主党派及团体，概略介绍如下：
    中国国民党革命委员会
    中国国民党革命委员会于一九四八年元旦在香港正式成立。在此以前，国民党内一部分反对蒋介石独裁的党员曾脱离国民党，另树组织，先后有李济琛、蔡廷楷领导的中国国民党民主促进会，以及何香凝、柳亚子、谭平山领导的三民主义同志联合会，中国国民党革命委员会即为这两个组织及其他反蒋的国民党员如冯玉祥、朱学范等参加的统一领导机构。该委员会成立时，曾发表宣言与行动纲领，宣称：“以中国国民党第一次全国代表大会决定之对外对内政策为基本原则”，主张将联俄联共扶助工农政策扩大为“联合世界上以平等待我之民族”，“联合国内一切民主党派”及“耕者有其田”三项政策。同时主张“倒蒋”“反美”，成立民主联合政府。
    中国民主同盟
    中国民主同盟的前身为统一建国同志会，成立于一九四○年一月，一九四一年三月改称民主政团同盟，先后参加者有救国会、第三党（后改名中国农工民主党）、中华职业教育社、乡村建设派、东北革命同志会、国社党（后改名民社党）、青年党及个人盟员如张一岷、柳亚子、张澜等。一九四五年九月始称现名。一九四六年政协会议前，青年党投靠蒋介石，脱离民盟。翌年一月民盟二中全会将另一反动组织民社党开除。政协以来，他们主张停止内战实行政协决议，盟员闻一多、李公朴、杜斌丞均因反内战反独裁遭受蒋介石残杀。一九四六年十一月蒋介石召开伪国民大会，一九四七年春伪政府改组，他们均拒绝参加。十一月，国民党政府宣布解散民盟，十一月五日该盟主席张澜宣布民盟“自动解散”。不久，该盟另一部分领导人如沈钧儒、章伯钧、周新民等出走香港，与其南方负责人如邓初民、彭泽民、沈志远等，于一九四八年一月举行三中全会，重建领导机构，并发表宣言，提出四项主张：“一，在目前形势下，欲实现中国的和平民主，已不可能由谈判妥协求之；二，反对代表地主豪绅买办封建的整个集团，彻底实行土地改革，然后工商业才能繁荣；三，反对美国对华侵略政策，不承认对外的一切损害中国人民利益的条约；四，愿与一切民主党派合作，造成坚强的民主统一战线，中国共产党为民主之先进，其奋斗的历史，值得每个爱国的中国人敬佩，本盟愿与他们携手合作”。
    中国民主促进会
    中国民主促进会于一九四六年政协时期在上海成立，由上海一部分学者、作家及工业界人士组成，领导人为马叙伦、王绍鏊。一九四六年六月二十三日上海各界代表为反对内战主张和平赴宁请愿，上海民众五、六万人送至车站，当晚抵南京即被国民党特务殴伤于下关车站，其中多数代表即为中国民主促进会领导分子。
    致公党
    洪门为满清时反清复明之组织，太平天国革命失败后，洪门领袖杨辅清走美洲，创立洪门会。一九四四年三月纽约洪门会召开全美洲洪门恳亲大会，决议将美洲致公堂，改为中国洪门致公党。其主张为“对外实现领土主权完整，对内取消一党专政，实现民主政治。”一九四六年该党领导人司徒美堂回国，拟在上海组织洪门致公党，遭上海帮口反对，司徒美堂遂宣布脱党。现在之领导人为陈其尤。
    中国农工民主党
    中国农工民主党通称第三党，一九二七年蒋介石叛变后，在上海成立之中华革命党，即其最初之组织。一九三○年一月正式组党，更名为中国国民党临时行动委员会，被蒋介石杀害的邓演达，即为当时该党之领导人。一九三三年冬，该党领导人曾参加福建人民政府事变。失败后，于一九三五年改组，称为中华民族解放行动委员会。一九四七年二月又更为现名。现在其政治主张为：一、支持民盟，实现民主，二、与全国工农共同奋斗，三、实行耕者有其田，改善工农生活，四、反对美帝国主义的侵略及援蒋内战，确保中国的独立与自主。该党领导人为章伯钧、彭泽民。
    中国人民救国会
    自一九三一年“九一八”以来，蒋介石政府一贯执行对日投降的卖国政策，激起全国人民的坚决反对，一九三五年北平学生首先发难，掀起“一二九”伟大抗日运动，全国各地纷纷响应，上海文化界联合各界成立上海各界救国联合会，一九三六年五月三十日于上海召集全国代表，成立全国各界救国会联合会，选出马相伯（已故）、沈钧儒、邹韬奋（已故）、陶行知（已故）、章乃器等三十五人为执行委员。这便是中国人民救国会的前身。该会成立宣言响应中国共产党“八一宣言”的号召，要求立即抗日，“停止一切内战”，“迅速建立民族阵线”。一九三六年沈钧儒、邹韬奋、沙千里、李公朴、王造时、章乃器、史良因主张团结御侮，同时被蒋介石反动政府逮捕下狱，时称为“七君子”，至抗战爆发后始释出。一九三八年，沈钧儒领导组织全国抗战建国协进会，备遭国民党迫害。一九三九年又恢复旧名，不久便参加统一建国同志会及民主政团同盟，始终为民主同盟之中坚。日本投降后，始易现名。一九四六年以来，该会一贯拥护政协路线，反对国民党反动派的独裁、内战、卖国的反人民政策。现在的领导人为沈钧儒、李章达。
