　　The village of Hulei Mountain in Wu'an County is a village with a relatively solid foundation in mutual aid production. Starting in 1944, under the leadership of labor hero Wang Dazhuang, the entire village was organized for production. However, due to formalistic work styles, several serious deviations arose. The village once forcibly organized the entire village into a large mutual aid group, with some organizing communal dining, which the masses were unwilling to do, and cadres would label those who didn't as backward. Mutual aid teams had no freedom of movement; if the work wasn't finished, no one could freely leave. The entire village engaged in production competitions; as soon as the drum sounded, even if they hadn't finished eating, they had to get up and go to the fields. Sometimes many people would work on one piece of land, which looked fast on the surface but actually wasted a lot of labor. In order to win, teams worked tirelessly. Wang Ertang's team started early and worked late, once working more than eight *xiangs* in a day (normally five *xiangs* in a day), exhausting everyone. Mutual aid teams unilaterally emphasized taking care of the poor, hired laborers, and orphans, disadvantaging households with labor. The masses were dissatisfied with this approach. When party rectification began this spring, all the mutual aid teams and production brigades in the village, except for the small team led by labor hero Wang Dazhuang, which could still engage in mutual assistance on a small scale, completely collapsed. After party rectification, most cadres, influenced by certain deviations during the rectification, abandoned production leadership, and no one reorganized mutual aid. On the one hand, the masses still remembered the benefits of mutual aid in the past, but on the other hand, they felt that mutual aid in the past was too restrictive. The old members of Dazhuang's team often grumbled at mealtimes, asking Dazhuang if they would still engage in mutual aid this year. Dazhuang understood the masses' thinking, so he widely publicized the mutual aid policy, saying: This year, mutual aid will be implemented in a new way, with no forced organization; whoever wants to participate can participate. Under this genuine principle of voluntarism, before the wheat harvest, Shuanhe and 12 other households jointly organized a work exchange team, and everyone held a meeting to review past deviations and mistakes, and publicly elected Wang Dazhuang as the leader. Their mutual aid method was to exchange labor for labor, returning labor at any time, working together when needed, and each working separately when not needed. For the time being, only male laborers participated, without scoring points or using work points. When someone outside the team needed labor, they could simply tell Dazhuang, who would introduce someone to go. Whoever had surplus labor could freely decide among themselves, without restriction from the team leader. After the wheat harvest, the team used 242,000 yuan to buy two cotton ginning machines, deciding on a share of 10,000 yuan for a full share and 5,000 yuan for a half share, with whoever wanted to participate participating. Yincheng, Yinji, Yuanming, Changhui, and others who had previously jumped to other teams have now returned. When Si Laoben was hoeing seedlings, because he couldn't manage alone, he asked Dazhuang's team for four people, who finished hoeing in half a day. Later, he also joined the work exchange team. In this way, the work exchange team gradually expanded to 28 households, with 38 male full and half laborers, and 27 female full and half laborers, with a total of 355 mu of land. Everyone's production enthusiasm is very high, and they are currently rushing to hoe seedlings and make fertilizer, striving to hoe the millet one more time. This autumn, the entire team plans to plant 122 mu of wheat, aiming to apply 20 loads of fertilizer per mu.

(Taihang Branch Press Note: The process of the Hulei Mountain mutual aid team from collapse to re-establishment shows that the masses, on the one hand, oppose forced orders and formalistic work styles, but also do not forget the benefits of mutual aid. As long as the leadership can earnestly correct deviations, clear up outstanding issues, and reorganize based on the principles of voluntarism and equivalent exchange, the masses are willing to engage in mutual aid. Some comrades only see the side of the masses opposing formalism and forced orders in mutual aid, and do not see the side of the masses benefiting from mutual aid in the past. Therefore, they completely negate the achievements of past organization and allow it to collapse on its own, which is an extreme and erroneous approach. Reorganizing mutual aid must have strong and effective leadership, promoting the good and correcting the bad, so that mutual aid teams can develop forward and become conscious and voluntary production organizations of the masses. In the reorganization, it is necessary to oppose the tailism of abandoning leadership.)

### 忽雷山群众不忘互助好处　改进领导又组织起来

　　忽雷山群众不忘互助好处
  　改进领导又组织起来
    【太行电】武安忽雷山村是一个互助生产较有基础的村庄。该村从一九四四年起，在劳英王大庄带领下，全村组织起来进行生产。但由于形式主义作风，产生了若干严重的偏向。该村曾强迫编制全村大互助，有的组织大锅集体吃饭，群众不愿这样做，干部就说人家落后。互助组出入不自由，如果活做不完，谁也不能自由出外。全村进行生产竞赛，一打鼓，就是吃不完饭，也得站起队往地里走。有时许多人到一块地上做活，表面上看着很快，实际上浪费了不少劳力。各组为了争胜，不顾疲劳的一直干。王二堂组搭黑起早，一天曾赶过八晌（一般一天五晌），把人都累坏了。互助组片面强调照顾贫雇孤寡，使有劳力户吃亏。对于这种作法，群众都不满意。今春整党一开始，全村的互助组和生产大队，除了劳英王大庄领导的小组还能三三两两拨工互助外，其余全部垮台。整党后，大部分干部由于整党时的某些偏向影响了工作情绪，放弃了生产领导，互助没人整顿。群众一方面对过去互助得到的利益还念念不忘，另一方面却感到过去互助受拘束太厉害。大庄组的旧组员在饭场上就经常圪嚷，问大庄今年还互助不互助。大庄摸透了群众的心思，便广泛宣传互助政策说：今年互助要实行一种新的方式，决不能强迫编制，谁愿意参加就参加。在这种真正的自愿原则下，麦收前拴和等十三户便共同组织起一个拨工组，大家开会检讨了过去的偏向和错误，公选王大庄为领导人。他们的互助办法都是工拨工，随时还工，需要时就伙干，不需要时就各干各的。暂时只有男劳力参加，没有评分，也未使用工票，组外有人需要劳力时，与大庄一说，便可介绍人去。谁有剩余劳力，由他们相互自由决定，组长不加限制。麦收后，组内用了二十四万二千元买了两辆弹花车，决定一万元一股，五千元半股，谁愿参加谁参加。银成、银吉、元明、长会等过去跳到别组，现在又回来了。四老笨在锄头遍苗时，因一个人赶不过来，便向大庄组找了四个人，半天就锄完了。后来他也参加了变工队。这样变工队逐渐扩大到二十八户，男全半劳力三十八个，女全半劳力二十七个，共土地三百五十五亩。大家生产情绪很高，现正突击锄苗造肥，争取谷子多锄一遍。秋后全队计划种麦一百二十二亩，每亩做到上肥二十驮。
    （太行分社按：忽雷山互助组从垮台而再起的过程，说明群众一方面是反对强迫命令与形式主义的作风，但也并不忘记互助的好处。只要领导上能认真纠正偏向，清理遗留问题，根据自愿等价原则来整顿，群众是愿意互助的。有些同志只看到群众反对互助中形式主义与强迫命令的一面，看不到群众过去因互助得利的一面，因此就完全否定过去组织起来的成绩，一任其自流垮台，这是走了极端，是错误的。整顿互助必须有强有力的领导，发扬好的，纠正坏的，使互助组能向前发展，成为群众自觉自愿的生产组织。在整顿中要反对放弃领导的尾巴主义。）
