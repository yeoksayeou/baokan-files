　　Letter of Correction
　　To the Editors of the People's Daily: I am Jia Dingwen, director of the Cejing Farmers' Association in the Second District of Shahe County. I was very saddened to see the article "Why I Didn't Let Liu Shuan and Get Married" published on page two of the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Daily on June 6th. Liu Shuan and's real name is Zhang Liushuan, and I have no objection to his marriage to Ma Shuangzhen. The article stated that I wouldn't allow him to see women, reported to the district that he wanted to "rape first and then marry," wouldn't allow them to get married, wanted the marriage certificate back, and wouldn't let the matchmaker Zhang Qiu take care of the matter, etc. I never said these things. It is true that I was working in the fields and not at home on the day Zhang Liushuan married Ma Shuangzhen. We have all testified about this matter in the district, and the actual situation is that Ma Shuangzhen has three daughters and a son who did not want their mother to marry someone else. They cried and hindered her, and Ma Shuangzhen, moved by this, was also unwilling to get up and marry, thus failing to meet Zhang Liushuan's request. I hope the editors will make a correction.

　　来函更正
    人民日报编辑同志：我是沙河县二区册井农会主任贾定文，前晋冀鲁豫人民日报在六月六号二版登载着我为何不让刘拴和结婚一稿，我看到十分难过，刘拴和他的真名叫张留拴，他给马双珍结婚，我对这没有意见。报上登着我不叫见女人面，并上区上说先奸后娶，不能结婚，往回要结婚证书，不叫介绍人张秋的管这事等，这些话我并没有说过。在张留拴给马双珍结婚那天，我在地劳动没在家，这是对的。关于这事我们都到区上对证了，实际情况是马双珍有三个闺女一个小子，不愿意叫他母亲和别人结婚，哭哭啼啼阻碍她，马双珍在这种感动下，亦不愿起身了，因此不满张留拴的要求。希编辑同志更正为盼。
