　　Correspondence
　　No. 10
　　To comrades of the local committees, district offices, county offices, and local correspondents:

　　The autumn harvest and wheat planting season has arrived. Please vigorously report on the autumn harvest and wheat planting in various regions, as well as the mobilization and organization of autumn plowing:

　　1. How is the leadership fully leading and organizing the masses for this year's autumn harvest? What is the situation of labor and animal power organization in various regions? How are the masses being organized? What role are women and children playing in the autumn harvest? How are households without labor power solving their difficulties? What are the actual harvest conditions in various regions this year? In disaster-stricken areas, how is the leadership organizing the masses to expand wheat planting and helping to solve the difficulties of wheat planting? In non-disaster areas, how are the masses combining autumn harvest, wheat planting, and autumn plowing to achieve timely wheat planting and universally complete autumn plowing? How is the production mood of the masses stabilized during the autumn harvest, so that the masses can boldly apply fertilizer, cultivate meticulously, and expand wheat planting?

　　2. In the autumn harvest in the border areas, please focus on reporting the situation of our efforts to take the initiative in launching the struggle to protect the autumn harvest. The masses are organized to carry out a combination of labor and military affairs, joint village defense, launching explosive political offensives to disintegrate the enemy and puppets, quick harvesting, quick fighting, and quick hiding, setting off a mass movement to protect the autumn harvest. What exemplary deeds and creations have the masses made in the struggle to protect the autumn harvest?

　　3. In addition to the above suggestions for reporting, pay attention to having a process and being comprehensive in reporting. What are the problems, characteristics, experiences, and lessons learned in this year's autumn harvest? What are the ideological problems of the masses? We hope you will write to us at any time.
