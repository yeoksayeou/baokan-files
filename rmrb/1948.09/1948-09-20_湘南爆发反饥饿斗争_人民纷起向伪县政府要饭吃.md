Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th -- According to the Shanghai News on August 9th, a widespread famine has recently occurred in various counties in southwestern Hunan. People in each county have risen up to demand food from the puppet county governments. More than a thousand starving people in Xinning County stormed the county government to petition on July 26th and 27th. The puppet county magistrate ordered the county police to carry out a large-scale massacre, resulting in the tragic deaths of several starving people and widespread chaos in the city. Shops and schools, moved by righteous indignation, went on strike in unison to protest the puppet government's atrocities. On the 28th, hundreds of starving people again broke into the county government. The puppet county magistrate, intimidated by the power of the masses, led the police with guns and retreated to the suburbs, where the two sides faced off for several days. Similar movements have erupted in the neighboring counties of Chengbu and Wugang: On July 22nd, thousands of starving people in Chengbu, carrying baskets and bamboo crates, rushed into the puppet county government hall to demand food from the county magistrate. The puppet police opened fire to intimidate them, but the starving people did not retreat. Only when the puppet county magistrate agreed to sell the grain levy at a public price did the masses withdraw. The people of Wugang also surrounded the county government due to famine. In late July, more than a hundred starving people in Anren County, in southeastern Hunan, carrying baskets and bamboo crates, looted all the grain from the Tangwan granary belonging to the county.

　　湘南爆发反饥饿斗争
  　人民纷起向伪县政府要饭吃
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据上海新闻报八月九日载，最近湘西南各县普遍发生饥荒，各县人民纷起向伪县政府要饭吃。新宁县饥民千余人，于七月二十六、七两日冲向县府请愿，伪县长竟令县警大肆屠杀，饥民惨死数人，全城大乱。商店、学校激于义愤，一致罢市、罢课，以抗议伪政府之暴行。二十八日饥民数百又闯进县府，伪县长慑于群众威势，率领枪警，退守城郊，双方相持数日。邻近之城步、武冈两县也爆发同样运动：七月二十二日城步饥民数千人，肩篓挑箩奔入伪县府公堂，向县长要饭吃，伪警开枪示威，饥民不退。直至伪县长允将赋谷公粜，群众始退出。武冈人民亦因饥荒，一度包围县府。湘东南之安仁县七月末亦有饥民百余人挑箩背筐，将该县属塘湾一粮仓之粮食抢光。
