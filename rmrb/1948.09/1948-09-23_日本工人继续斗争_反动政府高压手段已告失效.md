　　Using Strikes to Oppose Anti-Strike Orders
  　Japanese Workers Continue to Struggle
  　Reactionary Government's High-Pressure Tactics Have Failed
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th] Reports from various sources: Japanese workers' struggle against anti-strike orders continues to develop. According to the Ministry of Transportation's announcement on the 8th, recently, 736 state-run railway workers have been fired for striking, 389 arrested, and 629 have had their wages reduced. As of September 10th, the reactionary government has issued 20,000 arrest warrants to strikers. However, according to Agence France-Presse, these high-pressure tactics "have failed." On September 7th alone, 1,029 crucial railway workers in Hokkaido went on strike, including many drivers. In August, strikes in Hokkaido caused 1,562 trains to be cancelled, almost paralyzing the local economy. According to the Ministry of Communications, as of the 14th, 437 communications workers have "voluntarily resigned." Electrical workers responded to the current sporadic strikes on the 14th by continuously carrying out short-term power outages; for example, 33 of the 48 power plants in Gunma Prefecture in central Japan conducted short-term strikes; a power station in Wakayama Prefecture experienced an eight-hour power outage on the 14th.

　　以罢工反对反罢工令
  　日本工人继续斗争
  　反动政府高压手段已告失效
    【新华社陕北二十日电】各方报导：日本工人以罢工反对反罢工令的斗争继续开展中。据运输省八日宣布：最近国营铁道工人因罢工被开除者七百三十六人，被捕者三百八十九人，受减低工资处罚者六百二十九人。截至九月十日，反动政府已向罢工者发出拘票两万张。但是，据法新社称，这些高压手段“已告失效”。九月七日一天内，仅北海道就有一千另二十九名紧要的铁道工人罢工，包括许多司机。八月份北海道的罢工曾使一千五百六十二班列车停驶，当地经济生活几乎瘫痪。据递信省宣布：至十四日为止，已有四百三十七个递信工人“自行离职”。电气工人十四日响应目前零散式的罢工，不断进行短时间的停电；例如中部群马县四十八个电力厂中三十三个厂进行短期罢工；和歌山县一电力站于十四日停电八小时。
