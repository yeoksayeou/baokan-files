Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th: At the Labor Congress on the 21st of last month, Comrade Li Lisan gave a summary of the discussions on the current tasks of the Chinese labor movement. He first stated that all labor unions in the liberated areas, the Chinese Labor Association, representatives of democratic labor unions in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and representatives of major cities and industries, unanimously agreed with Comrade Gao Gang's political report and Comrade Chen Yun's report on the current tasks of the Chinese labor movement, based on their different practical experiences in various regions. They unanimously supported the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's general line and various policies in the current revolution. The representatives also unanimously and enthusiastically supported the proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to convene a revolutionary political consultative conference without the participation of reactionaries, opposing the reactionary rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang, and to establish a revolutionary coalition government. Comrade Zhu Xuefan, representative of the Labor Association, also submitted a written proposal for the realization of this proposal. All of these prove that the Sixth National Labor Congress marks the unprecedented great unity of the Chinese working class, not only establishing a unified national All-China Federation of Trade Unions in organization, but also achieving ideological consensus and unity of will. Through this congress, the unity of the national working class will be further consolidated, and the actions of the national working class will be more unified. With the leadership of such a united working class, the liberation struggle of the broad masses of the people will surely develop more vigorously and help the people's liberation war to accelerate its victory. Comrade Li Lisan pointed out that any reactionary ruling class, when it is about to perish, will always make a last-ditch struggle. For example, recently the Kuomintang reactionary group has carried out an unprecedented large-scale plunder in the economy with the so-called currency reform, issuing "gold yuan" banknotes; at the same time, it has organized special criminal courts and arbitrarily arrested people, using even more brutal means to suppress the resistance movement of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, especially workers and students. It can be asserted that all these struggles will only arouse the hatred of the people, strengthen the unity of the people, and more resolutely rise up to support the revolutionary war of the People's Liberation Army.

	Comrade Li Lisan pointed out that the working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has always inherited the glorious tradition of history. The future task of the working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is, as pointed out in Comrade Chen Yun's report, to use tactics more flexibly, pay close attention to the methods and means of struggle, consolidate their positions, accumulate strength, expand their ranks, and prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, they must work hard to study production issues, prepare to immediately take control of enterprises and manage enterprises after liberation, prevent the enemy from sabotaging them before their demise, and do their best to protect machines, factories, and all materials, transforming bureaucratic capitalist enterprises into people's enterprises.

	Regarding the tasks of the labor movement in the liberated areas, Comrade Li Lisan first pointed out that, thanks to the extremely high consciousness of the workers and staff in the liberated areas, who have recognized their position as masters of the country, they have demonstrated amazing labor enthusiasm and created various heroic deeds. In short, Comrade Li Lisan pointed out that there are still many difficulties in developing production in the future, and the only reliable way to overcome these difficulties is to "rely on the masses." Therefore, after explaining the issue of democratic management of public enterprises based on the principles and methods in Comrade Chen Yun's report, he proposed that public enterprises in various liberated areas should immediately begin to select key points, try out the organization of factory management committees, and establish employee representative conferences in larger enterprises with more than 500 people. The management committee should be composed of the factory director, technicians, and employee representatives. The factory director should have the final decision-making power. In case of emergencies, the factory director may handle the matter first and then submit it to the management committee for approval. If the factory director's opinion contradicts the opinion of the majority of the committee members, the factory director's opinion should be implemented first, and the matter should be reported to the higher authorities for instructions. Comrade Li Lisan summarized the four functions of the factory management committee and the employee representative conference: (1) to unite all employees, cooperate fully, and develop production; (2) to demonstrate the principle that employees are the masters of the enterprise in the organization, and to improve employees' labor enthusiasm, discipline, consciousness, and sense of responsibility for production; (3) to promote criticism and self-criticism, and overcome bureaucracy; (4) to cultivate employees' ability to manage production. He proposed entrusting the executive committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to study and formulate detailed regulations on factory management committees and employee representative conferences. Next, he gave a brief explanation of the issue of enterprise management, proposing nine conditions for achieving enterprise management: (1) strict production plan; (2) strict economic accounting system; (3) the administrative and wage system should be based on operating ability, technical knowledge, proficiency, and work attitude; (4) strict worker assessment system; (5) reasonable working conditions; (6) a reasonable organizational structure suitable for scientific management principles; (7) strict responsibility system; (8) labor discipline and reward and punishment system; (9) implementation of labor inspection and finished product inspection. In addition, he also provided explanations to the various questions and specific issues raised by the representatives, such as wage systems, working hours, leave issues, age limits for child labor, the necessity of labor contracts, and labor insurance. Regarding the issue of working hours, he pointed out that only small businesses or shops that cannot temporarily shorten working hours, and large enterprises that must operate day and night and consistently implement a two-shift system, may temporarily implement twelve hours; otherwise, it should be set at eight to ten hours.

	After Comrade Li Lisan's summary, the conference unanimously adopted the resolution on the current tasks of the Chinese labor movement and handed it over to the executive committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for textual modifications before publication. Regarding the constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Comrade Li Lisan also provided detailed explanations to several issues raised by the representatives during the discussions that were questioned or disagreed with, and obtained the approval of the conference, which was handed over to the executive committee for textual modifications.

　　李立三同志根据劳动大会讨论
  　总结中国工运当前任务
    【新华社东北六日电】劳动大会于上月二十一日由李立三同志作大会关于中国职工运动当前任务讨论的总结。他首先说明：所有各解放区工会，中国劳动协会，国民党统治区各民主工会的代表，各大城市、各大产业的代表，在讨论中均根据各地不同的实际经验一致同意高岗同志的政治报告和陈云同志关于中国职工运动当前任务的报告，一致拥护中共中央在目前革命中的总路线和各种政策。各代表并一致热烈拥护中共中央所提出的召集没有反动派参加的、反对美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动统治的革命的政治协商会议、及成立革命的联合政府的主张；劳协代表朱学范同志并且为这一主张的实现提出了书面建议。这些都证明了第六次全国劳动大会标志着中国工人阶级的空前大团结，不仅在组织上成立了全国统一的中华全国总工会，而且取得了思想上的一致和意志的统一。经过这次大会，全国工人阶级的团结必更加巩固，全国工人阶级的行动必更加统一。有了这样团结统一的工人阶级的领导，广大人民的解放斗争一定会更汹涌的向前发展，帮助人民解放战争加速获得胜利。立三同志指出任何反动统治阶级快要灭亡时，总是要拼死作最后挣扎的。如最近国民党反动集团在经济上实行空前大掠夺的所谓币制改革，发行“金圆”钞票；同时，组织特种刑事法庭，滥捕人民。用更残暴的手段镇压国民党统治区的人民——首先是工人和学生的反抗运动。可以断言，这一切挣扎，只会更引起人民的仇恨，更加强人民的团结，更坚决地起来支援人民解放军的革命战争。
    立三同志指出国民党统治区的工人阶级是始终继承着历史的光荣传统的。国民党统治区工人阶级今后的任务就是如陈云同志的报告中所指出的：要更灵活地运用策略，十分注意斗争方式和方法，巩固自己的阵地，积蓄力量，扩大队伍，准备迎接人民解放军。同时，要努力研究生产问题，准备在解放后，能立即掌握企业，管理企业；防止敌人在覆灭前的破坏，全力保护机器工厂以及一切物资，将官僚资本的企业转变为人民的企业。
    关于解放区职工运动的任务，立三同志首先指出由于解放区的职工已有极高的觉悟，认清了自己主人翁的地位，因而表现了惊人的劳动热忱，创造了各种英雄事迹。总之立三同志指出今后在发展生产方面还有不少困难，而战胜困难的唯一可靠办法便是“依靠群众”，因而他对公营企业管理民主化问题，依据陈云同志报告中的原则和办法加以阐明后，提出各解放区公营企业应立即着手选择重点，试行组织工厂管理委员会，并在五百人以上的较大企业中建立职工代表会议，由厂长，技术人员和职工代表组织管理委员会，厂长应有最后决定权，如遇紧急事件，厂长得先行处理，再提交管理委员会批准；遇有厂长意见与大多数委员意见矛盾时，首先按厂长意见执行，同时报告上级请示。立三同志归纳工厂管理委员会和职工代表会议的四个作用即：（一）团结全体职工，通力合作，发展生产。（二）把职工是企业主人翁的原则在组织上表现出来，提高职工劳动积极性、纪律自觉性和对生产的责任心。（三）发扬批评与自我批评，克服官僚主义。（四）培养职工管理生产的能力。他提议委托全国总工会执委会研究制订有关工厂管理委员会与职工代表会议的详细条例。接着，他对于企业化问题作了简单的说明，提出作到企业化的九个条件：（一）严密的生产计划；（二）严密的经济核算制；（三）任人行政与工资制度应以经营能力、技术知识、熟练程度、劳动态度为标准；（四）严格的考工制度；（五）合理的劳动条件；（六）适合于科学的管理原则的合理的组织机构；（七）严格的专责制；（八）劳动纪律和赏罚制度；（九）实行劳动检查，成品检验。此外他对各代表团提出的各种疑问和具体问题，如工资制度、工作时间、休假问题、童工年龄限制、劳动契约之必要、劳动保险等项都一一作了说明。他对工作时间问题指出只有在小企业或店铺暂时不能缩短工作时间的，以及须昼夜开班，一贯实行两班制的大企业，可暂行十二小时，其他则应定为八小时至十小时。
    立三同志总结毕，大会一致通过了中国职工运动当前任务的决议，并交付全国总工会执委会作文字上的修改然后公布。关于中华全国总工会章程，立三同志对各代表在讨论中提出了怀疑或不同意的几个问题，亦作了详尽解释，并获得大会通过，交执委会作文字上的修改。
