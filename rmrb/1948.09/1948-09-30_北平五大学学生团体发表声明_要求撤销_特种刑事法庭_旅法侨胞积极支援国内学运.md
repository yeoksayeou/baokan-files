　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. According to a United Press, Beiping dispatch on the 22nd: Student groups from five universities in Beiping, including Beiping Normal College, Peking University, Yenching University, Tsinghua University, and Sino-French University, jointly issued a lengthy written statement demanding the revocation of the Kuomintang government's "Special Criminal Tribunal" and condemning the tribunal as a disguised military court. The statement said: Since last month, the "Special Criminal Tribunal" has ordered the arrest of hundreds of pure and patriotic students (Note: arrest warrants for 320 students were issued in Beiping alone) under the false pretense of unfounded state affairs crimes. Universities in major cities have suffered "unprecedented harm," "the people's personal freedom has been deprived, and the dignity of academic institutions has been completely destroyed."
　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 27th. According to the Shanghai Observer magazine on September 15th: The Kuomintang reactionary government's large-scale bloody suppression of students has aroused angry protests from overseas Chinese. The "General Association of Chinese Laborers Participating in the War in France," the "Overseas Chinese Peace Promotion Association in France," the "Paris Chinese Student Association," the "Chinese Fine Arts Association in France," the "Science Students Association of the University of Paris," and the "Ministry of Education's 1946 Publicly Funded Students Association in France" formed the "Joint Association for Supporting the Domestic Student Movement." On August 20th, they sent a letter to the magazine stating: "We hope that teachers and students in China will continue to lead the people to resist violence and uphold justice." "We have launched a large-scale fundraising campaign abroad to support the domestic student movement." The letter also paid tribute to the teachers and students across the country who are struggling arduously, protested the Kuomintang government's measures to arrest students, and called on compatriots across the country to unite in support of the patriotic and democratic student movement.

    【新华社华东二十七日电】据九月十五日上海观察杂志载：国民党反动政府大规模镇压学生的血腥罪行，激起国外侨胞的愤怒抗议。“旅法华侨参战华工总会”、“旅法华侨和平促进会”、“巴黎中国学生会”、“中国留法艺术学会”、“巴黎大学理科同学会”、“教育部三十五年度公费留法同学会”等团体组成“支援国内学运联合会”，于八月二十日向该刊投函称：“盼国内师生继续领导民众抵抗暴力，主持正义。”“我们已在国外发起大规模之募捐运动，以为国内学运之支援。”该函并向全国艰苦斗争的师生致敬，抗议国民党政府逮捕学生的措施，呼吁全国同胞一致支援爱国民主的学生运动。
