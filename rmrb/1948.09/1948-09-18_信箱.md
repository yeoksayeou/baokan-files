    Mr. Zong Yiting of Yuxin Flower Shop, Shijiazhuang: Regarding the matter of the Tongren Cooperative taking over the Dasheng Pharmacy in Handan, the original letter has been forwarded to the Border Region Government for them to investigate and reply.
    Mr. Su Fu of Xingtai County: In your county's Beixianxian Village, the misstruggle against the Jishanxiang and Juxingheng commercial firms in the city, the county district has decided to return the properties. However, the village cadres are using the excuse of "popular opinion" to not return them. This is incorrect. The county district should conduct another investigation and urge them to return the properties to their original owners as soon as possible.
    Mr. Xu Kegong of Xiangling: (1) What is your family's class status? Because you have not stated whether your main source of livelihood is land or industry, it is impossible to determine. (2) Since your family is a military family and lacks labor, regardless of your class status, you can request land tilling assistance.
    A certain person from Dongzhaotong Village, Zhengding: The matter of Zhai Xiaoen of your village bullying women and seizing civilian property has been reported to the Zhengding County Government for investigation and handling.
    A certain person from Unit 303: In the "Questions and Answers" column of this unit's 78th issue, the passage concerning women: "Land distributed during land reform after divorce can be taken away; land not distributed cannot be taken away," refers to the portion of land that a woman (regardless of her family's class status) is entitled to in her family, not specifically to land distributed during the land reform period.
    Mr. Bin Qiao of Jianping: If a certain working cadre in your county's Donghuanghua Village is indeed marrying someone else without going through divorce proceedings, it is a violation of the marriage regulations and you can request the Jianping County Government to handle it.
