[Jinzhong Dispatch] In the seventh district of Wenshui, the war support burden is unfairly distributed, and human and animal power are not adequately coordinated, leading to a widespread phenomenon of peasants selling donkeys. In Zhongzhuang Village, during the war support efforts, each ox averaged 8.5 war support workdays, each male laborer 12.4 workdays, and each donkey 29 workdays within eighty days. The donkey-raising masses felt the burden was too heavy, and some sold their donkeys, while others sold donkeys to buy oxen. Zhongzhuang Village had twelve donkeys, and on September 2nd, seven were sold in one day at the Macun meeting, and four oxen and horses were bought back. In Xicun Village, eight donkeys were exchanged for eight oxen and horses. In Dongcun Village, six donkeys were sold and three oxen were bought back. The masses in Tuta Village, who rely on raising donkeys to transport and sell coal for a living, also sold three donkeys. This phenomenon exists in most villages in the seventh district. When County Head Wang inspected war support production in the district, he further discovered that some villages had not kept accounts or made them public for a long time. For example, village cadres in Zhongzhuang Village raised donkeys without participating in long-term assignments. He immediately convened a cadre meeting to discuss solutions. In addition to criticizing the district cadres for their bad habit of ignoring problems, failing to solve them after discovering them, and failing to report them to higher authorities, the meeting, based on the opinions of the majority of the masses during the investigation, formulated four specific solutions: (1) Clear up the old accounts for the eighty days and make them public to everyone. Those who owe workdays should repay them or provide grain. If some poor people really cannot repay the workdays, they can be repaid after the autumn harvest. (2) Each village should establish an inspection committee to announce war support workdays every month and settle accounts every three months. (3) Human and animal power should be coordinated in a planned manner, saving animal power as much as possible. For example, when delivering grain and wheat, human power should be used more when possible. (4) Collective expenses distributed throughout the team are not recorded, and often the entire team and village bear the burden. At several meetings, it was determined that the county level and above should keep accounts to balance the burden between districts and villages.

　　文水七区
  　战勤负担不公
  　农民纷纷卖驴
    【晋中电】文水七区战勤负担不公，人畜力没有适当调剂，造成群众普遍卖驴现象。中庄村在支前中，八十天内平均牛出战勤工八点五个，男劳动力出十二点四个，毛驴出廿九个。养驴群众感到负担过重，有的把驴卖掉，有的卖驴换牛。中庄村有驴十二头，九月二日在马村会上一天就卖了七头，买回四头牛马。西村八头驴换了八头牛马。东村卖了六头驴买回三牛。土塔村群众长年靠养驴驮卖煤为生，也将驴卖了三头。这种现象在七区大部村庄都有。王县长到该区检查支前生产时，更发现有的村长期不算帐，不公布。如中庄村村干部养驴不支长差等。随即召集干部会议，讨论解决办法。会上除批评了区干部这种对问题熟视无睹、发现问题后既不解决又不向上级反映的坏作风外，并根据调查中多数群众的意见，定出四条具体的克服办法：（一）清理八十天的旧帐，向大家公布。欠工的还工或出粮。如有些贫苦群众着实还不起工，可以秋后补还。（二）各村成立检查委员会，每月公布战勤工，三个月结算一次。（三）人畜力有计划的调剂，尽可能节省畜力。如送粮送麦，可能时多用人力。（四）整个队里分配了集体花销不记帐，往往整个队与村负担起几次会上确定了县级以上的记帐，平衡区与区、村与村的负担。
