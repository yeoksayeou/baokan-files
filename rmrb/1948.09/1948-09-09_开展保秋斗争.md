　　Launch the Autumn Harvest Protection Struggle

    As the autumn harvest approaches, the Chiang bandits, besieged by our forces in a small area and a few isolated cities in North China, will undoubtedly intensify their looting due to the unprecedented famine of food. Therefore, protecting the autumn harvest has become the central task of the Party, government, army, and people in the border areas of north of Daqing River, Chahar South, Yanbei, northern Henan, southern Shandong, and the Yellow River area of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Province.

    To accomplish the task of protecting the autumn harvest, the following work must be carried out resolutely and consistently.

    First, we must conduct widespread and in-depth propaganda and ideological mobilization among the Party, government, army, and people in the border areas, so that the broad masses understand the significant role and meaning of protecting the autumn harvest and preventing the enemy from taking a single grain of food, which can accelerate the enemy's demise. We must overcome all paralysis and passive phenomena, and consciously and actively launch a grain protection struggle against the enemy.

    Second, we must earnestly implement the policy towards the enemy in the border and guerrilla areas, continue to correct and avoid past deviations, strengthen leadership, and consolidate and expand the anti-American, anti-Chiang, patriotic united front. It must be clearly announced that land reform will be suspended in the border areas, and rent and interest reduction will be implemented (the vested interests of the peasants must be protected). We must carry forward the experience of the Anti-Japanese War and unite the largest number of people to fight against the enemy. At the same time, we must actively launch a political offensive, publicize the victories of our army, point out the overall collapse of the Kuomintang reactionaries in military, political, and economic terms, expose the Kuomintang's conspiracy to plunder the people by issuing fake gold yuan coupons, and correctly implement the policy of leniency, so that the broad masses of people and enemy officers and soldiers in the border areas can recognize the current situation and our Party's policies, disintegrate the enemy, strengthen our ranks, and defeat the enemy.

    Third, we must learn from the experience and lessons of protecting the wheat harvest this summer. In the early stages of the summer wheat protection struggle, some areas were temporarily put in a passive position and suffered unnecessary losses due to insufficient prior vigilance and preparation. Later, the leadership in the border areas grasped the analysis of the situation, actively organized offensives, and took the initiative, thus reversing the situation. Therefore, in the autumn harvest protection struggle, we must remember this lesson, stay sober, and strive for initiative. The armed forces in the border and guerrilla areas should actively engage, look for opportunities to strike the enemy, and avoid passively dividing troops to guard key points, but should organize battles in a planned and focused manner. We must be good at utilizing our superior mass conditions, give full play to the tradition of combining labor and military affairs, launch a widespread mass guerrilla war, implement joint village defense, and launch an explosion movement. The economic and trade departments in the border areas should also organize forces to cooperate with the armed struggle to smash the enemy's conspiracy to buy and defraud food. At the same time, we must not only protect the autumn harvest of the masses in the border areas, but also go deep into the Kuomintang-controlled areas to prevent more of the masses' rations from being snatched by the enemy.

    Fourth, implement quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick drying, quick storage, and quick planting.

    This year's autumn harvest protection struggle is a part of the entire war and production task. With the victory of autumn harvest protection, the entire North China will be liberated more quickly; with the victory of autumn harvest protection, the foundation will also be laid for large-scale production in the border areas next year.

    Grain is the lifeblood of the people, we must resolutely protect it!

    Be proactive, combine military, political, and economic struggles, organize offensives, protect the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army on all fronts to strive for greater victories!

### 开展保秋斗争

　　开展保秋斗争
    秋收将至，在华北被我围困在狭小地带与几个孤城的蒋匪，由于食粮的空前恐荒，必将更疯狂的进行抢掠，因此保卫秋收，就成为大清河北、察南、雁北、豫北、鲁南与冀鲁豫黄河南等边沿地区党政军民的中心任务。
    为了完成保卫秋收任务，必须坚决一致的进行下列工作。
    第一、要在边地党政军民内进行普遍深入的宣传与思想动员，使广大群众了解保卫秋收，不让敌人抢走一粒粮，可以加速敌人的死亡的重大作用与意义，克服一切麻痹消极现象，自觉的积极的对敌人展开保粮斗争。
    第二、认真执行边沿区和游击区对敌政策，继续纠正和避免过去发生过的偏向，加强领导，巩固扩大反美、反蒋、爱国统一战线。要明确宣布边地停止土改，实行减租减息（对农民既得利益，则要予以保护），发扬抗日时期的经验，团结最大多数人民一致对敌。同时，积极开展政治攻势，宣传我军胜利，指出国民党反动派在军事、政治、经济上的总崩溃，指出国民党发行伪金元券对人民的大掠夺的阴谋，并正确执行宽大政策，使边地广大人民和敌军官兵认清时局和我党政策，瓦解敌人，壮大我们的队伍，战胜敌人。
    第三、接受今夏保卫麦收经验与教训。今夏护麦斗争初期，由于事先警惕和准备不够，有些地区曾一时陷于被动，遭受不应有的损失。以后边地领导上抓紧分析形势、积极组织攻势，取得主动，才扭转了形势。因此，在保秋斗争中，我们要记取这一教训，保持清醒，力求主动。边缘区及游击区武装要积极活动，寻找机会打击敌人，不要消极的分兵把口，而要有计划有重点的组织战斗。要善于利用我们优于敌人的群众条件，发挥劳武结合的传统，开展广泛的群众游击战争，实行联村联防，开展爆炸运动。边地经济贸易部门，亦应组织力量，配合武装斗争，粉碎敌之收买、骗取食粮阴谋。同时，不仅要保卫边沿区群众的秋收，还要深入国民党统治区，使更多群众的口粮不被敌人抢去。
    第四、实行快收、快打、快晒、快藏、快种。
    今年的保秋斗争，是整个战争和生产任务的一部分。有了保秋的胜利，全华北就能更快获得解放；有了保秋的胜利，也就为边地明年大生产打下了基础。
    粮食是人民的命根，我们要坚决保卫它！
    积极主动，军事、政治、经济斗争相互结合，组织攻势，保卫秋收、秋耕、秋种，配合各线解放军争取更大胜利！
