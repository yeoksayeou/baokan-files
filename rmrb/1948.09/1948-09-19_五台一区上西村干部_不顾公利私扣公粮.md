The cadres of Shangxi Village, Wutai First District,
Disregard Public Interest and Secretly Withhold Public Grain

During the public grain collection last year, the cadres of Shangxi Village, Wutai First District, were afraid of difficulty in assigning labor, so in order to get a good reputation from the people, they did not report the already collected two thousand catties of public grain to the higher authorities and kept it in the village warehouse specifically for stretcher transport and village school expenses. Now, as the final collection of past arrears is being carried out, the district cadres asked them to hand it over, but they all said that they could not collect any more. Later, the district cadres slowly investigated and found out that the village had secretly withheld more than two thousand catties of public grain. During the cadre meeting in the evening, they confessed the truth. This practice of deceiving the higher authorities and affecting the entire front-line support work for the convenience of one village's people is very wrong. Leaders in various places should quickly pay attention to whether there are similar situations.

### 五台一区上西村干部　不顾公利私扣公粮

　　五台一区上西村干部
  　不顾公利私扣公粮
    五台一区上西村，在去年征收公粮时，干部们怕支差人困难，为了叫老百姓说好，把已起了的二千斤公粮也没报告上级就放在村库里，专供给担架运输和村学校开支。现在要结束过去征收尾欠，区干部叫他们缴，都说一点也不能起了。后来，区干部慢慢调查，才知道该村私自扣存公粮二千余斤的事。晚上，干部会上检讨，他们才实说出来。这种为了一个村群众的方便而欺骗上级，影响整个支前工作的做法，是非常错误的，各地是否还有这种情形，领导上应赶快注意起来。
