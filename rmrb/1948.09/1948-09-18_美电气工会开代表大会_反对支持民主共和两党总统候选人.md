Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 13th: TASS, New York, September 9th: The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), one of the three major unions of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), held a convention attended by 1,000 delegates representing 500,000 workers. The majority of the union's leadership passed a resolution recommending that it not support any presidential candidate, asserting that each union member, local union, or district union should decide on this issue according to its own wishes. The convention severely condemned those union leaders who presumptuously attempted to represent the interests of the people by supporting the Democratic and Republican parties, as well as those who participated in the anti-communist movement launched by these two parties to maintain their political monopoly. The resolution criticized right-wing union leaders for supporting the Democratic Party under the pretext of "choosing the lesser of two evils." The convention rejected the proposal of the union's former president, Emspak, to support Truman as a presidential candidate. The New York Herald Tribune and the New York Times admitted that the majority of the convention supported Wallace. The majority of the convention delegates denounced the conspiracy of the union's right-wing leaders (led by former president Emspak) to undermine the union's activities by using the Taft-Hartley Act, and passed a resolution demanding that the CIO leadership condemn and not support such a conspiracy. The convention re-elected Fitzgerald as the union's president, with Emspak's henchmen only receiving 18 percent of the vote. Furthermore, the executive board of the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU), which has 100,000 members, passed a resolution by a vote of 19 to 5 at its meeting on September 5th, vehemently denouncing the presidential candidates of the Democratic and Republican parties and condemning the union's president, Quill, for unilaterally announcing his support for Truman without consulting the executive board.

　　美电气工会开代表大会
  　反对支持民主共和两党总统候选人
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社纽约九日讯：产联三大工会之一的联合电气、无线电工人工会召开代表大会，出席者有代表五十万工人的代表一千人。工会领导机关的绝大多数通过决议，建议不支持任何总统候选人，主张各会员工会或地方工会根据自己的意愿决定此一问题。大会严厉谴责那些支持民主、共和两党独揽人民利益代表权的狂妄企图的工会领袖，以及那些参加该两党为维持其政治垄断而发动的反共运动的人们。决议批评右翼工会领袖在“两害相权取其轻”的借口下支持民主党。大会否决了该工会前主席加莱号召支持杜鲁门为总统候选人的建议。纽约先驱论坛报与纽约时报承认：该大会大多数支持华莱士。大会大多数代表斥责该工会右翼领袖（以前主席加莱为首）图利用塔夫脱——哈特莱法案破坏该工会活动的阴谋，并通过决议，要求产联领袖谴责及不支持此种阴谋。大会再次选举费兹吉拉德为该工会主席，加莱的走卒仅获得百分之十八的选票。又拥有会员十万人的产联运输工人工会执行局于九月五日会议中，会以十九对五票通过决议，痛斥民主、共和两党的总统候选人，谴责该工会主席奎尔未与执行局协商即擅自宣布支持杜鲁门之行动。
