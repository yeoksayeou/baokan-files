Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—According to various sources, the Kuomintang reactionary government is currently intensifying its efforts to annex all commercial banks and firms in its controlled areas, especially Shanghai, that are not part of the four major families. They are seizing the foreign currency and precious metals held by these firms. In Chiang Kai-shek's "Measures for Handling Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency," announced on August 19th, it was stipulated that only the puppet Central Bank and its authorized banks were allowed to exchange, hold, or safeguard gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currency. Other banks and money shops were forbidden from doing so and were required to convert and deposit these assets with the puppet Central Bank. Commercial banks and firms recognized this as a major annexation scheme. Therefore, according to Chiang Kai-shek's remarks at an expanded memorial week meeting in Nanjing on the 6th, "The Shanghai Banking Association intends to gather US$10 million from all Shanghai banks and firms to sell to the Central Bank as a way to fulfill their responsibilities." Chiang Kai-shek was enraged by this and, at the meeting, vehemently cursed the Shanghai banking community, saying that they "still have the same mindset as they did twenty or thirty years ago, loving only money and not the country, knowing only selfishness and not the people's livelihood, with no change whatsoever." He threatened them, saying, "Since they do not love the country (the four major families), the country will not be lenient with them either." Chiang Kai-shek finally set a deadline of September 8th for all major commercial banks and firms in Shanghai to automatically register and deposit all their foreign exchange with the puppet Central Bank; otherwise, they would be "severely punished." At the same time, he ordered the puppet Vice Minister of Finance, Xu Baiyuan, and Yu Hongjun to go to Shanghai on the 7th to force the commercial banks and firms to hand over their foreign exchange. This foreign exchange asset is rumored to "total US$400 million" (Reuters, Shanghai, 7th). Under Chiang Kai-shek's hooligan-like threats and the application of violence, although Shanghai commercial banks and firms prepared to hand over a portion of their foreign exchange, many firms adopted a passive resistance approach and "sold all or most of their assets, remitting them to Guangzhou, and then converting them into Hong Kong dollars in Guangzhou to escape to Hong Kong" (Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th).

Another method used by the Kuomintang reactionary government to annex commercial banks and firms was the so-called "Measures for Adjusting the Capital of Commercial Banks" passed by the puppet Executive Yuan on the 4th. These "Measures" stipulated that commercial banks and firms in the Kuomintang-controlled areas must re-adjust their capital. For example, the minimum capital for joint-stock banks in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou was set at 500,000 puppet gold yuan notes, and the minimum capital for money shops of the same nature was 250,000 puppet gold yuan notes. Those that did not meet this minimum were not allowed to operate. If firms wished to continue operating, in addition to converting their original capital into puppet gold yuan notes, at most 50% of the shortfall could be covered by revaluing the original assets, while at least 50% of the capital must be subscribed in cash by the original shareholders in proportion within two months. This cash must be deposited with the puppet Central Bank within three months of completing the capital increase, and its use would require the approval of the competent authority of the puppet Ministry of Finance. This means that each commercial bank and firm must contribute at least 50% of its newly increased capital in cash to the puppet Central Bank, allowing this treasury of the four major families to "increase capital."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—Under the large-scale robbery and plunder by the four major families, a large amount of capital from the Kuomintang-controlled areas has fled to Hong Kong. According to Reuters, Shanghai, 8th, citing reports from Ta Kung Pao, Xinwen Bao, and Shen Bao, "Guangzhou has become an open channel for the flow of funds from Shanghai to Hong Kong." A Hong Kong report from Xinwen Bao stated that since the promulgation of the "Economic Control" regulations, the funds flowing into Hong Kong from Shanghai "have been so large that they cannot be estimated." Due to the large influx of foreign currency and gold, the Hong Kong market has been in severe turmoil in the past few days. A Guangzhou correspondent for the same paper reported that in the six days from September 2nd to 7th, "approximately 1.6 million gold yuan flowed into Guangzhou from Shanghai." According to Ta Kung Pao's statistics, 644,701 puppet gold yuan were remitted to Guangzhou from Shanghai and other places on September 4th alone, and 672,169 yuan on September 6th. These funds flowing into Guangzhou were then converted into Hong Kong dollars in Guangzhou and escaped to Hong Kong. According to a TASS report from Shanghai on the 7th, citing Ta Kung Pao, the Kuomintang reactionary government was "seriously shocked" by the large amount of capital fleeing from Shanghai to South China.

　　蒋贼公开抢劫商业行庄
  　商民识破阴谋大量资金逃往香港
    【新华社陕北十三日电】据各方消息：国民党反动政府，近日正加紧吞并其统治区各地尤其是上海的四大家族以外的一切商业行庄。夺取行庄手中所存有的外币金银。在八月十九日蒋贼公布的“金银外币处理办法”中，即规定除伪中央银行及其委托的银行之外，其他银行、钱庄一律不准收兑、持有或保管黄金、白银、银币及外币，必须分别向伪中央银行折换及储存。商业行庄知道这是一个大吞并的阴谋。所以，据蒋介石于六日在南京扩大纪念周会上说：“上海银行公会理事会，拟集合上海所有各行庄凑集美金一千万元卖给中央银行，便算塞责了事。”蒋贼为此恼羞成怒，乃在该会上破口大骂上海银行界，说他们“仍如过去二三十年前不爱国家只爱金钱，只知自私不知民生的脑筋，毫无改变”；并恫吓他们说：“彼等既不爱国家（四大家族），而国家对他们自亦无所姑息”。蒋贼最后限定上海各大商业行庄必须于九月八日以前，将所有外汇自动向伪中央银行登记存放，否则便“予以严厉制裁”。同时又命伪财次徐柏园及俞鸿钧等于七日去沪，强迫各商业行庄交出外汇。这笔外汇资产，据传“总数共达四亿美元”（路透社上海七日电）。上海各商业行庄在蒋贼流氓式的恫吓及暴力相加的威胁之下，虽然准备交出一部分外汇，但不少行庄则采取消极抵抗的办法，而“将其全部或大部分资产变卖，汇至广州，再由广州套汇港币，逃往香港”（中央社南京七日电）。
    国民党反动政府吞并商业行庄的另一办法，是伪行政院于四日通过的所谓“商业银行调整资本办法”。这一“办法”规定国民党统治区各地的商业行庄必须重行调整资本，例如上海、天津、广州三市股份有限公司性质的银行资本最低额，规定为五十万伪金元券，同一性质的钱庄资本最低额为二十五万伪金元券，凡不足此最低额者，即不准营业。如需继续营业的行庄，除以原有资本折算伪金元券外，不足之数中至多只能有百分之五十由原有资产重新估价抵补，而至少有百分之五十的资本必须于两个月内由原股东按比例认缴现金。这笔现金并须于完成增资后三个月内，储存于伪中央银行，如有用途应经伪财政部主管机关之核准，才能动用。这就是说，每一商业行庄至少必须拿出其新增资本百分五十的现金，奉献给伪中央银行，让这个四大家族的金库去“增资”。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】在四大家族进行大规模抢劫掳掠之下，国民党统治区的大量资金已逃往香港。据路透社上海八日电引大公报、新闻报、申报的消息称：“广州已成为上海资金向香港流转的敞开孔道”。新闻报香港消息称：自“经济管制”条例颁布以来，从上海流入香港的资金，“已庞大得无法估计”。由于大宗外币黄金的流入，过去数日内香港市场已剧烈混乱。该报广州通讯报导，自九月二日至七日的六天之内，“约有一百六十万金元自上海流入广州”。另据大公报统计：九月四日一天之内上海等地汇入广州的伪金元为六十四万四千七百零一元；六日一天之内为六十七万二千一百六十九元。这些流入广州的资金，便在广州套汇港币，逃往香港。据塔斯社上海七日电引大公报消息称：国民党反动政府已为大量资金自上海逃至华南一事所“严重震惊”。
