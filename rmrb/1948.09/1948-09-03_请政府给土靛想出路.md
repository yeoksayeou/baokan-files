　　Please Government, Find a Way Out for Indigo
　　Editor：
    In order to resist enemy goods and develop indigo production in the liberated areas, the government and newspapers have actively advocated planting indigo. This year, the acreage and output of indigo have increased dramatically compared to previous years. In the area along both banks of the Fu River east of Nanyan Village and west of Fudong Bridge in Yongnian alone, the acreage and output of indigo this year have increased tenfold to fifteenfold compared to last year. Due to the influx of foreign dyes and the limited number of local dyeing houses, the sale of indigo has become a major problem, and prices have fallen accordingly. The price of the best red indigo this year is only about 4,000 yuan per jin (with a three-tael scale). Such indigo yields only thirty-five to forty jin per mu. Let's say it's forty jin, worth 160,000 yuan. However, each mu of indigo requires 400 jin of fertilizer (oil cake). Currently, local rapeseed cake costs 240,000 yuan per 1,000 jin (18-tael scale), which amounts to 96,000 yuan. Add to that the cost of consumption during soil manufacturing (good meals), which requires 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, totaling about 120,000 yuan (excluding the cost of frequent irrigation and weeding). Each mu of indigo yields only a profit of over 40,000 yuan, which can only buy 200 jin of rapeseed cake (fertilizer) or no more than 4 dou of millet. It turns out that planting indigo is less profitable than growing grain. Under such unprofitable circumstances, it is very difficult for indigo farmers to sell indigo and exchange it for other food. Because there is nowhere to sell, my village planted 80 mu of indigo, but only 3 mu have been sold to local small dyeing houses. The rest has been ignored. In general, indigo farmers urgently need to sell indigo to buy fertilizer for planting cabbage. The time for fertilizing cabbage is imminent, and it is difficult to proceed without fertilizer. I hope that the editor will appeal on our behalf and suggest to our government and relevant agricultural authorities to establish shops for the purchase and sale of indigo and to provide indigo loans to facilitate adjustments and benefit production. Otherwise, not only will the acreage of indigo be reduced next year, affecting the resistance to enemy loans, but also this season's cabbage production will be greatly affected.

### 请政府给土靛想出路

　　请政府给土靛想出路编辑同志：
    为了抵制敌货，发展解放区的土靛生产，政府和报纸积极提倡种土靛，今年种土靛的亩数和产量比往年有极大的增加。仅永年南沿村以东、府东桥以西的滏河两岸，今年种土靛的亩数和产量，比去年增加了十倍至十五倍。由于外来的颜料充斥，本地的染房又滑有多少，土靛的出售成了大困难，价格也随之低落。今年最好的红色靛价格，每斤（加三秤）在四千元左右。像这样的靛每亩地仅产三十五斤到四十斤，就按四十斤算吧，值十六万元。但每亩土靛得用肥料（油饼）四百斤，现下当地菜子饼每千斤（十八两秤）二十四万元，该洋九万六千元；再加土制造时的消耗（吃好饭），需一万至两万，共费去十二万元左右（经常浇锄人工在外），每亩靛仅落四万余元，只能买二百斤菜子饼（肥料），买小米也不过四斗，算起来种靛还不如种粮食利大。在这样不合算的情况下，种靛户想把靛买用换成其他食料是很不容易的。因为无处可卖，我村种土靛八十亩，现下卖给本地小染房的滑有三亩，其余就无人过问。一般的种靛户，极需售靛卖肥料养种白菜；刻下白菜施肥在即，无肥难以下。望编辑同志代为呼吁，向我政府及有关农业机关建议，设收卖土靛的商店，我指靛贷款，以资调剂而利生产。否则不仅来年土靛亩数减少。以抵制敌贷，且本季白菜生产也受莫大的影乡。    永年大堡种靛户农民谨启
