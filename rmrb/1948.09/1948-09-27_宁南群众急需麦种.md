　　Ningnan Masses Urgently Need Wheat Seeds
    I originally lived in Liujia Tai Village, Ningnan County, Jinnan District. Our area was flooded in July, and nothing was harvested. The flood was eight or nine feet deep. Now the flood has receded completely, and the land is entirely suitable for sowing wheat. However, the villages do not even have enough to eat. Each mu of land requires two and seven-eighths sheng of seeds, which is a real problem. Precisely because the disaster area in Ningnan County is so wide, the government cannot provide large-scale seed loans. The masses request the newspaper to appeal on their behalf. The masses are willing to find a place, as long as they can borrow seeds, they are willing to repay more next wheat harvest. Otherwise, a serious grain shortage will certainly occur next spring and summer, and sowing autumn crops will be even more problematic.
    It is now very convenient to sow wheat. After the flood receded, no livestock is needed, and three or four people can sow the seeds. This is called "plowing wheat" locally. Generally, "plowing wheat" yields better and is more drought-resistant. The local masses eagerly await a reply!

　　宁南群众急需麦种
    我原住冀南区宁南县刘家台村，我处在七月间被水淹没，颗粒未收，平地水深八九尺。至现在洪水已落完，平地完全可耩麦子，可是各个村庄中连吃的也没有，每亩地得耩二升七八合种子，实成问题。正是因为宁南县灾区太宽，政府也不能大力贷种子。群众意见无论如何请求报社呼吁一下，群众愿找个地方，只要能贷种，明年麦熟情愿还多一些，不然明春夏一定造成严重粮荒，种秋地更成问题。
    现在种麦很便利，水落后不用牲口，只是三四人就可种下。这在当地叫犁麦子，犁麦子一般收成较好而且耐旱。当地群众热望着答复！
