Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th -- Reports from various sources: The French General Confederation of Labor (CGT), the "Workers' Force" union, and the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC) issued a joint communiqué, calling on their eight million members to hold a two-hour general strike on September 24th. The communiqué pointed out: French workers can use this national demonstration to express their strong will to be able to maintain their livelihood. Prior to the issuance of the joint communiqué by the three major unions, strike movements had already spread throughout France, especially in Paris. On the 15th, 90,000 aviation, automobile, and steel workers in the Paris region held a strike. Aviation workers also marched in formation to the front of the head office of the state-owned airline, holding small flags with the slogans "We want bread!", "We want a democratic government!", and "Down with the Marshall Plan!". On the 16th, 400,000 metalworkers in the Paris region held a 24-hour strike, demanding a 33% wage increase. The Pravda reporter Zhukov reported from Paris that the current characteristic of the French workers' movement is that "the workers' economic demands are increasingly combined with political demands. Now, the most advanced workers are not only demanding wage increases. Experience has shown that even when they obtain wage increases, prices rise again. These most advanced workers are bravely meeting the difficulties; they are opposing the 'Marshall Plan,' demanding the abolition of France's economic dependence on the United States, and demanding the establishment of a democratic coalition government that does not serve Wall Street but can safeguard the interests of France. Workers are gaining increasingly frequent and resolute support from farmers, artisans, and small merchants who are also suffering from the 'Marshall Plan.'"

　　法三大工会号召八百万会员
  　定期举行总罢工示威
    巴黎数十万工人罢工要面包要民主
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】各方报导：法国总工会、“工人力量”工会、基督教工人联盟发表联合公报，号召其所属之八百万会员于九月二十四日举行两小时总罢工。公报指出：法国工人可借这一全国性的大示威，以表示他们要求能够维持生存的坚强意志。在三大工会的联合公报发表以前，全法各地已弥漫着罢工运动，特别是在巴黎。十五日，巴黎区九万航空、汽车、钢铁工人举行罢工。航空工人并列队往国营航空公司总公司门前示威，他们手执小旗，上书“我们要面包！”“我们要民主的政府！”“打倒马歇尔计划！”。十六日，巴黎区的四十万金属工人举行二十四小时的罢工，要求加薪百分之三十三。真理报记者朱可夫自巴黎报导称：目前法国工人运动的特点，是“工人的经济要求与政治要求日益结合。现在，最先进的工人不仅是要求增资而已。经验业已表明，即便当他们获得增资时，物价又有新的上涨。这些最先进的工人正奋勇迎接困难，他们正反对‘马歇尔计划’，要求取消法国对美国经济上的依赖，要求建立民主联合的政府，这个政府不为华尔街服务，而能维护法国的利益。工人正获得同样遭受‘马歇尔计划’打击的农民、手工业工人和小商人越来越经常而坚决的支持。”
