  　Reporter's Account of the Battle on the Outskirts of Jinan

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Front, 25th】Our frontline reporter's account of the battle on the outskirts of Jinan states: At midnight on the 16th, the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the People's Liberation Army launched the great campaign to liberate Jinan. Tens of thousands of PLA soldiers, along a front of over a hundred li, surged towards Jinan from all directions. On the eastern front, under the cover of artillery fire and tanks, our troops eliminated enemy resistance and rapidly captured enemy positions at Maoling Mountain, Yanchi Mountain, Zhongjingdian, Hancang, Guodian, and others. On the 17th, they captured strongholds at Xindian, Huilong Town, Dianliuzhuang, Yaotou, and others. On the 18th and 19th, our troops on this front continued to attack and advance, successively occupying Yanchi Mountain, Majiazhuang, Pingdingshan, Yinjiazhuang, and Hongjialou. On the 20th, they captured Huayuanzhuang, the sugar factory, Huangtai Mountain, Yiwang Bridge, and Yangtouyu, with their vanguard reaching the city of Jinan. In the above battles, portions of the enemy's 73rd Division and the 57th Brigade of the 83rd Division were annihilated. On the western front, our troops cleared out bandits south of Changqing city on the 15th, capturing over 700 alive; they then turned east and attacked in coordination with our eastern forces, capturing enemy strongholds such as Yangjiatai, Pipa Mountain, and Lijiazhuang east of Changqing on the same day. On the 17th, they continued their attack, occupying positions such as Fanhuitun, Silizhuang, Changqitun, Phoenix Mountain, and Renlizhuang, and successfully converged with our southern forces. On the same day, a unit of our troops on this front, in a brief 50-minute battle, completely annihilated a battalion of the Kuomintang Second Security District's Special Service Brigade and the puppet Changqing County Brigade, totaling over a thousand men, liberating Changqing County. On the 18th, they captured strongholds such as Boji Mountain, Damiaotun, Wangjiatun, and Zhao Jiazhuang, advancing towards Jinan step by step. On the 19th, they completely annihilated over a thousand enemy vanguards at Guanzhuang. At this time, the entire Kuomintang 84th Division and a battalion of the 8th Security Brigade victoriously staged a battlefield uprising. Our troops then rapidly occupied La Mountain, Duandian, the Army Barracks, and Yujiazhuang, directly pressing the edge of the western commercial district, and also occupied the airport, completely cutting off enemy air reinforcements. In the above battles, our troops on this front annihilated approximately one regiment of the enemy's 2nd Division. On the southern front, our troops occupied Yangshanyu and Shuang Shantou on the 16th, and the defending enemy fled in disarray. On the 17th and 18th, they occupied Zhangxia, Gu Mountain, Danga Zhuang, Dajian Gou, Jiashan Po, Kang Erzhuang and Shi Fang Yu, then victoriously joined forces with the western front troops, advancing in unison, and on the 19th occupied Qilishang, Baima Shan, Wangguan Zhuang, Jingjia Gou, Longke, and Xinglong Shan; thus from the south they attacked the edge of the commercial port. In the above battles, our army annihilated a portion of the enemy's Second Division, capturing one howitzer, and a total of four infantry guns and recoilless guns. On the northern front, our troops captured Qihe County on the evening of the 16th, and the defending enemy fled south across the river. On the same day, another unit of our troops occupied Beiluokou, Zaoyuan, and Xiaozhan. On the 17th, they reoccupied Queshanzhuang and Meihua Mountain. On the 19th, they crossed the Yellow River Iron Bridge, fiercely pursuing the fleeing enemy, and occupied Xincheng, Phoenix Mountain, and Nanluokou on the south bank of the Yellow River, attacking Jinan from the north. By this point, our troops on all four fronts had completed the close encirclement of the enemy defending Jinan city and the commercial district. In the above battles, the fighting style implemented by the People's Liberation Army was fierce attacks, fierce charges, fierce pursuits, and fierce advances, disrupting the enemy's deployment and not allowing the enemy the slightest chance to catch its breath, successfully completing the first stage of the liberation of Jinan campaign. From the launch of the offensive to the clearing of enemy outposts, it only took four days.
