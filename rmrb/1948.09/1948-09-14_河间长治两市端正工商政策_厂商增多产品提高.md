[Ji Zhong Electric] Hejian City has seen a gradual development of its industry and commerce since it corrected its industrial and commercial policies, rectified errors that infringed upon industry and commerce, and the government and banks have provided greater support to industry and commerce. According to statistics from January, excluding vendors, the city had a total of 242 industrial and commercial households; by the end of July, this had increased to 341 households, an increase of 99 households. Among the newly added households, industry accounted for 62%. In terms of the textile industry: the city had no foundation in the past, but with the support of the government, according to statistics from August, the number of weaving households has increased from 10 in January to 24, driving a number of women to engage in weaving. The mass factory alone has driven 480 households. The quality of products is also improving day by day. For example, the striped and patterned earth cloth woven by mass and Xin Sheng factories, and the socks woven by Guangfa and Yihua are very strong and sell well in nearby counties. Recently, in order to solve the problem of cooked cotton for textile households, the electric light company has researched and developed the use of electricity to drive six cotton gins, which can produce 500 kilograms of cooked cotton per day. One has already been installed, and others are being installed. In terms of the iron industry: in addition to the 12 blacksmith furnaces that regularly manufacture agricultural tools, there are also 8 iron factories. The front, rear, and middle axles and axle blocks produced by Zhenzhong, Zhenxing, and Dazhong are of good quality and are sold in Shijiazhuang, Southern Hebei, and other places. Dazhong has also created a casting machine. The iron pots cast by a certain iron factory are often not enough to sell. They are now vigorously manufacturing waterwheels and other agricultural tools. In terms of wood product manufacturing: there are already 8 wood factories, mainly manufacturing large carts, waterwheels, looms, agricultural tools, and sideline tools. For example, Xinghe Wood Factory manufactured 22 large carts, 75 small carts, repaired 75 large carts, and 2 looms in half a year, and also created a light hoe (which can replace the plow, saving animal power). In terms of the chemical industry: there are currently 3 soap factories, etc. Manager Ma of the mass factory has also researched and developed the use of local alkali to boil caustic soda, which can replace foreign alkali, and has been successfully tested. Wanyou Factory earned a net profit of 619,000 yuan in seven months. Yuhua Factory has been able to manufacture its own ink, ink sticks, ink, etc. Chexin Pharmacy has begun to self-produce Dawang Oil, Ten Drops Water, Rendan, and Plague Prevention Powder. Minsheng Firecracker Factory has also successfully tested the manufacture of firecrackers. The shoe industry had developed to 60 households and 700 workers, driving 2,500 people (mostly women) by the time of the wheat harvest. From April 20th to June 10th, 14,379 pairs of shoes were produced in 50 days. Since the rectification of the village, the quality of shoes has been greatly improved. In terms of commerce: because the city is located in the center of central Hebei, most goods are concentrated in the city and then transferred to various places; coupled with the needs and increased purchasing power of farmers after land reform, commerce is also developing day by day. Among the merchants, the cart, general merchandise, pharmacies, and restaurants are the most numerous. The above five industries have developed to 114 households. In order to activate the financial market, Tongyi Bank (privately operated) has recently been added. The industrial and commercial households are also very active in repairing and building houses and rectifying storefronts. The 40 storefronts and houses of 13 households that were burned down by the Fu bandits during the spring were all repaired in one month with the support of the government.

Although Hejian's industry and commerce are gradually developing, there are still many shortcomings in the city's leadership of industry and commerce, such as the lack of clear development priorities for industrial development and the lack of long-term development plans. The development of the shoe industry has not opened up sales channels based on the needs of the masses, and only relies on public purchases, resulting in a large number of blind developments. As a result, some businesses have closed down after the public no longer purchases them. The housing problem has not been well resolved in the past. The houses of landlords and former rich peasants that were confiscated and requisitioned during land reform have not been properly dealt with; the rent collection in various villages is very inconsistent (some prices are too high), which has affected the development of some industrial and commercial households. The attendance of industrial and commercial households is unbalanced. For example, Dehe Yong, a grocery store, often sends laborers, while Baiyunzhong Factory and Dazhong Factory have not sent a laborer for several years. At the same time, due to the prosperity of the market and the large amount of goods being transported, industrial and commercial households often feel the difficulty of transportation capacity. These problems have had a certain impact on the further development of industry and commerce, and the city is currently studying solutions.

[Taihang Electric] Changzhi City has seen significant development in industry and commerce after returning subsidies to industry and commerce and correcting forced mutual assistance for industrialists. Private capital has increased, and industrial technology has improved. In terms of commerce: according to incomplete statistics, 52 new merchants were added to the five streets in May and June, with a capital of 100,348,500 yuan, accounting for 9.1% of the city's total commercial capital, of which 30 were privately operated, with a capital of 60,970,000 yuan, accounting for 58.9% of the new capital. Mass cooperative enterprises totaled 18, with a capital of 24,215,500 yuan, accounting for 23.4% of the new capital. Publicly operated enterprises totaled 4, with a capital of 18,300,000 yuan, accounting for 17.7% of the new capital. There were 101 new vendors, accounting for 42.5% of the original vendors, with a capital of 43,072,200 yuan, an increase of two times compared to the past vendors' capital. The development of industry: is reflected in the improvement of technology and the improvement of tools. Xinghua Factory private workers used vegetable oil to make their own coal gas and glycerin, which were of good quality and sold well. The factory's business has greatly developed. Recently, more than 6,000 kilograms of gas and kerosene and more than 200 kilograms of glycerin have been produced, and all of them have been bought by merchants from Shijiazhuang, Linfen, and other places through the Hundred Goods Conference. A merchant from Shijiazhuang has also booked more than 2,000 kilograms of kerosene, which is being rushed day and night. Currently, the factory workers are studying local charcoal boiling to expand reproduction. Wang Fengming, a skilled worker at Yihhe Knitting Factory, transformed the pressing machine to increase efficiency tenfold. Wang Fengming led all the workers to design and make wooden frames with the factory's wood during their spare time, and transformed four small iron wheels and one large iron wheel. Without spending a penny, a new pressing machine was made in May. In the past, two people could iron 40 kilograms of material per day, but now three people can iron 600 kilograms per day with the new machine. In the past, ironing material required 7 kilograms of charcoal per day, but now no charcoal is needed. Handicraft industry has developed rapidly after correcting forced mutual assistance and promoting free production: The production of the fur industry on Qingzhen Street has a new look. Ma Baoze of No. 20 Street is a skilled maker of black sheepskin pants. Because he was forced to participate in mutual assistance last year, his production enthusiasm was not high, and he was also afraid that others would say he was rich, so he did not dare to take capital out to produce. After promoting free production, he took 290 leather pants (worth 150,000 yuan) to Jincheng the day after withdrawing from the group and exchanged them for 400 black leather pieces. The down pulled off by his children was enough to cover the cost, and the leather was pure profit. Now, after operating for more than a month, in addition to what has been sold, there are actually 250 pieces of white leather and 215 pieces of black leather in stock, worth 1,430,000 yuan. Miao Chou'e, a merchant of iron goods in Nanguan Street, actively collected iron from various places after understanding the policy. Since April, she has collected an average of more than 10,000 kilograms per month, earning more than 100,000 yuan per month. In order to accumulate capital and expand production, she took 600,000 yuan and borrowed 750,000 yuan from the bank to build a mill. With four animals and three and a half laborers, she can earn 22,000 yuan per day. From July 10th to this month's 10th, she has earned more than 660,000 yuan by grinding wheat in one month.

　　河间长治两市端正工商政策
  　厂商增多产品提高
    【冀中电】河间市自端正了工商政策、纠正了侵犯工商业的错误，而政府和银行对工商业更大力扶植，因此，该市工商业日渐发展。据一月份统计，除摊贩外，全市共有工商户二百四十二户；到七月底，已增加到三百四十一户，共增加了九十九户；新增户中工业占百分之六十二。在纺织业方面：该市过去本无基础，在政府扶植下，据八月份统计，已由一月份的十户织布户增加到廿四户，并带动一部纺织妇女。只群众工厂即带动四百八十户。在产品的质量上，亦日见提高。如群众、新生等工厂织的条格花纹等十余种土布，广发、益华织的袜子等都很坚固，畅销附近各县。最近为解决纺织户的熟棉问题，电灯公司已研究出用电力带动六个轧花机，每日可出熟棉五百斤，现已按上了一个，其他正在安置。在铁行方面：除现在铁匠炉十二个经常制造农具外，并有铁工厂八个。振中、振兴、大中等四户出品的前后中轴和轴挡，质量很好，行销石门、冀南等地。大中还创造了铸扣机。某铁工厂铸出的铁锅，常不够卖。现正大力制造水车，及其他农具。在木货制造上：已有木厂八个，主要是制造大车、水车、织布机和农具，以及副业工具。如兴合木厂半年中就制出大车二十二辆，小车七十五辆，修理大车七十五辆、织布机两张，还创造出轻便耠子（可以代替犁张，能节省畜力）。化学工业方面：现有造胰厂等三户，群众工厂马经理并研究出用土碱熬成火碱，可以代替洋碱，现已试验成功。万有工厂七个月的纯利赚了六十一万九千元。玉华工厂已能自治油墨、墨汁、墨水等。车新药房开始自制大王油，十滴水、仁丹、避瘟散等药品。民生火柴厂制火柴，也已试验成功。鞋业到麦秋前后已发展到六十来户，七百个工人，带动群众二千五百人（大部是妇女）。从四月廿日到六月十日五十天即出鞋一万四千三百七十九双。自整庄后，鞋的质量已大为提高。在商业方面：由于该市处于冀中中心，一般货物多集中于该市再转各地；再加上土改后农民的需要及购买力的提高，使商业也日益发展。坐商中尤以车子行，广货、杂货、药铺、饭店等五行最多。以上五种行业已发展到一百一十四户。为了活动市面金融，最近又添设了同益银号（私营）。各工商户在修理与建筑房子、整顿门面上也很积极，春季被傅匪窜扰时烧毁的十三户四十间门面和房子，在政府扶植下，于一个月中全部修好。
    河间工商业虽日渐发展，但在该市对工商业的领导上仍有不少缺点，如发展工业与发展重点不明确，缺乏长期发展的计划。对鞋业的发展，没根据群众的需要打开销路，只依靠公家收买，使大量盲目的发展，结果公家不收买以后，有的歇了业。对于房子问题过去也未很好解决。土改中没收与征收地主旧富农的房子尚未适当处理；各乡收租很不一致（有的价太高），影响到部分工商户的发展。各工商户出勤不平衡，如杂货铺德和永三个人经常出夫，白云中工厂和大中工厂几年未出过一个夫。同时，由于市场的繁荣，货物大量的转运，工商户常常感到运输力的困难。这些问题，都给了工商业进一步发展上起了一定的影响，现该市正研究解决中。
    【太行电】长治市经过退补工商业及纠正对于工业者的强迫互助后，工商业均有显著的发展。私营资本增加，工业技术提高。商业方面：据不完整统计，五条街五、六月新增坐商五十二家，资金一万万零三百四十八万五千元，占全市商业总资金百分之九点一，内中私营三十户，资金六千零九十七万元，占新增资金百分之五十八点九。群众合作事业十八家，资金二千四百二十一万五千元，占新增资数百分之二十三点四。公营四家，资金一千八百三十万元，占新增资数百分之一七点七。摊贩新增一百零一个，占原有摊贩百分之四二点五，资金四千三百零七万二千二百元，较过去摊贩资金增加二倍。工业的发展：表现在技术的提高与工具的改良上。兴华工厂私营工人以植物油自制煤汽、甘油，质量好、销路广，该厂营业大为发展。最近制出之汽、煤油六千余斤，甘油二百余斤，经过百货大会已全部让石庄、临汾等地客商买去。石家庄某客商又预定两千余斤煤油，正日夜赶制中。现该厂工人正研究土煮黑，以扩大再生产。义合成针织工厂技术工人王凤鸣，改造压料机使效率增加十倍。王凤鸣带领全体工人于工余时间设计用厂里木料做木架，改造了四个小铁轮，一个大铁轮，没化一个钱，于五月做成新的压料机。过去每天二人能熨四十斤料子，改用新机后每天三人可熨六百斤，过去每天熨料需用木炭七斤，现在已不需用木炭。手工业在纠正强迫互助，提倡自由生产后迅速发展：清真街毛皮业生产有新气象，廿头街马保则是做黑羊皮裤的把式，因去年强制他参加互助，生产情绪不高，同时又怕别人说他富，不敢往出拿资本生产。提倡自由生产后，退组的第二天即拿皮裤二百九十张（合十五万元）到晋城换成四百张黑皮回来，和他孩拔下毛绒就够了本，皮是净利。到现在营业一月余，除卖出的外，实存白皮二百五十张，黑皮二百一十五张，合一百四十三万元。南关街铁货商人苗丑女了解政策后，积极到各地收铁。从四月起每月平均收万斤以上，月赚洋十万余元。为积累资本，扩大生产，又自拿六十万元，银行贷款七十五万元内设磨坊一座，有四个牲口雇三个半劳力每天可赚洋二万二千元，从七月十日到本月十日，一月内磨麦已赚六十六万余元。
