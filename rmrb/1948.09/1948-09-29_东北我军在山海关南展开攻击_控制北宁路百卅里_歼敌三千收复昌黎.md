Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 27th—A unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army launched an offensive against the enemy on the Beining Railway line between Luan County and Qinhuangdao on September 13th. By September 21st, a total of over 3,000 enemy troops had been annihilated, and the county town of Changli, as well as important stations and strongholds such as Liushouying, Beidaihe, Shimen, and Houfengtai, had been recovered, controlling over 130 li of the railway line between Tangshan and Liushouying. On September 13th, at the beginning of the offensive, our army successively captured Changli city and the stations of Shimen, Anshan, Houfengtai, and Zhangzhuang on the Beining Railway line, annihilating most of the enemy's Hebei Security 21st Regiment and Guard 1st Regiment. On the 16th, we continued to capture the stations and strongholds of Liushouying, Beidaihe, Yantongshan, Qiyunsi, Caigezhuang, Niujiazhai, and Gangezhuang east of Changli, annihilating one battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the enemy's Provisional 50th Division and the 9th company of the 3rd Regiment, as well as the division's transport battalion and part of the local armed forces. On the same day, the enemy's 62nd Army's 151st Division and two regiments of the 67th Division advanced eastward from Luan County to reinforce, and at about 11:00 on the 18th, they attacked Changli County, but were repelled by our defending forces after fierce fighting until dusk, capturing a portion of the enemy. On the 19th, the enemy again concentrated its main force to attack Habo Town, more than 30 li northwest of Changli. After repeated hand-to-hand combat, we stopped the enemy in the area south of the town. At dusk, we launched a counterattack, defeating the enemy, who fled west of Tangshan overnight. By this time, the entire 130-li railway line from Tangshan to Liushouying was under our control. On the 20th, the enemy again attacked our positions north of Tangshan with a division's strength, launching more than ten assaults with fierce artillery fire, all of which were repelled by our army. At 4:00 on the 21st, our army counterattacked again, routing the enemy and capturing some of them. Preliminary statistics of the above battles show that our army annihilated a total of 3,045 enemy troops, including 904 killed or wounded and 2,141 captured. We seized 2 rocket launchers, 2 82mm mortars, 21 60mm guns, 7 grenade launchers, 2 rifle grenade launchers, 88 light and heavy machine guns, 62 submachine guns, 2 carbines, 1,050 long and short guns, and more than 117,000 rounds of ammunition of various types.
