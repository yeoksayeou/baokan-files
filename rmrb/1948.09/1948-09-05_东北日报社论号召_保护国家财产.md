Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st. The Northeast Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Protect State Property, Protect Public Property," stating:

　　Our liberated areas now have large cities, large industries, and railways. Our state property and public property have greatly increased. This is a huge historical change in the development of the Chinese revolution. Because of this change, the revolutionary war can victoriously transition to today's large-scale offensive situation. The editorial continued: All state property and public property are the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the Chinese working people, and are a huge wealth of the nation. If these assets are in the hands of counter-revolutionaries, they will become tools for oppressing and exploiting the people and supporting counter-revolutionary wars; but if they are in the hands of revolutionary people, they will become tools for safeguarding the people's interests, raising the people's living standards, and supporting revolutionary wars. They are so crucial to the success or failure of the revolutionary war!

　　The editorial recalled the difficult conditions during the ten years of civil war and the War of Resistance Against Japan, stating: At that time, we did not have large cities, large industries, or railways. We relied solely on the unyielding efforts of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people to organize the economic strength of agriculture and handicrafts in the countryside and carry out long-term and arduous guerrilla warfare. At that time, we tasted the bitterness of "no industry, no cities" and suffered all kinds of hardships. At that time, we all thought that if we ever had these things, we must cherish them, use them well, and rely on them to overthrow the rule of the counter-revolutionaries.

　　The editorial pointed out that, unfortunately, many places and many comrades have not paid good attention to and implemented the protection of state property and public property. Especially in newly recovered areas, some people searching for scrap metal have "collected" complete lathes, boilers, and engines, making originally complete factories incomplete; in some places, when electrical materials are particularly scarce, some factories are even allowed to buy electric wires to melt and cast spittoons and washbasins, saying that this is "developing industrial production"; some places regard rails as scrap iron and sleepers as fuel, completely forgetting how much we currently need these materials for railway construction. In the old areas, after much education and struggle, the above phenomena are much less, but there are still chronic destructive and wasteful phenomena. In individual places, factories have caught fire carelessly, and huge amounts of grain have been wasted. Such damage and waste of state property and public property is a vicious enemy in the new democratic economic construction. To tolerate and condone these phenomena, and to turn a blind eye to them, is tantamount to committing a crime against the revolutionary cause.

　　The editorial pointed out that the main ideological causes of these phenomena are the guerrilla habits, localism, and narrow financial viewpoints developed over a long period in a decentralized, rural, and guerrilla warfare environment, so that when dealing with state property and public property, there is no overall concept, no unified concept, and no planned concept. As a result, they unconsciously damage the overall interests for the sake of the local interests of their own units. Furthermore, the reflection of some non-proletarian ideas—the disorganization, destructiveness, and selfishness of small producers, and the extravagance of playboys who do not work for a living—in the revolutionary ranks has aggravated these destructive and wasteful phenomena. Therefore, the protection of state property and public property must be achieved through serious ideological struggle.

　　In connection with this struggle, we must strengthen the planning of the entire financial and economic work and strive for true unity and centralization. If the state of each doing its own thing in the financial and economic system is not overcome, then the phenomena of destruction and waste cannot be completely eliminated.

　　At the same time, we must tighten up the protection methods and management system of state property. Political and economic organs must formulate systems for protecting and managing state property and public property, promulgate laws and regulations against destruction and waste of public property, and formulate strict sanction measures. Factories that cannot resume work for the time being and houses that cannot be repaired for the time being need to be guarded by special personnel. Do not save this relatively small expense and allow them to be destroyed, which would cause even greater losses to the state. Each factory, each agency, and each school must register all state property and public property, conduct regular inspections, and clearly define responsibilities and strictly enforce rewards and punishments for the custody and use of property.

　　In connection with this struggle, we must also create a large-scale, mass movement to protect state property. Mobilize the masses, especially the working class, to fight against all destructive and wasteful phenomena. We must fully understand and bring into play the enthusiasm of the working class for production and construction.

　　Finally, in the work of protecting state property, we must greatly enhance our vigilance, strengthen the work of safeguarding and eliminating spies, and prevent the sabotage plots of counter-revolutionary enemy agents.

　　The editorial pointed out that the revolutionary people paid a huge price to take back the cities, industries, and railways they created from the counter-revolutionaries, and many comrades sacrificed their lives for this. Our existing property is not only the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the working people, but also the crystallization of the blood and sweat of revolutionary heroes. Therefore, protecting state property and public property is the sacred revolutionary responsibility of every worker, farmer, intellectual, Communist Party member, public servant, People's Liberation Army fighter, and all democratic人士 (democratic people).

### 东北日报社论号召　保护国家财产

　　东北日报社论号召
  　保护国家财产
    【新华社东北一日电】东北日报顷发表题为“保护国家财产，保护公共财产”之社论称：
    我们解放区现在有了大城市、大工业，也有了铁路，我们的国家财产与公共财产是大大增加了，这是中国革命发展过程中一个巨大的历史变化。因为有了这一变化，所以革命战争才能胜利地转入今天大规模进攻的形势。社论继称：一切国家财产和公共财产，都是中国劳动人民的血汗结晶，都是国家民族的巨大财富。这些财富如果拿在反革命手里，就成为压迫人民、榨取人民与支持反革命战争的工具；但是如果拿在革命人民手里，就会成为保卫人民利益、提高人民生活水平、支持革命战争的工具了。它们对于革命战争就是如此的成败攸关！
    社论回溯十年内战和抗日战争时期的艰苦情况称：那时我们没有大城市、大工业和铁路，只靠中国共产党与中国人民不屈不挠的努力，组织农村中农业和手工业的经济力量，进行长期的艰苦的游击战争。那时，我们是尝过了“无工业，无城市”的滋味，受尽了千辛万苦的。那时我们都曾想到：如果我们一旦有了这些东西，一定要好好爱护它、使用它、依靠它来打倒反革命的统治。
    社论指出，现在对于很好地保护国家财产与公共财产，可惜还有不少地方不少同志没有很好的注意和执行。特别在新收复区，有些搜检破铜烂铁的人们，把完整的车床、锅炉和发动机也“检”走了，使本来完整的工厂倒反而残缺不全；有的地方，在电气材料特别缺乏的时候，竟允许某些工厂收买电线熔铸痰盂、洗脸盆，还说这是“发展工业生产”；有的地方把路轨当废铁、把枕木当燃料，完全没有想到我们目前铁路建设工作是多么需用这些材料。在老地区，经过许多教育与斗争之后，上述现象是比较少多了，但仍有慢性的破坏与浪费现象。个别地方，工厂不慎失火了，价值巨大的粮食耗费了。这种对国家财产和公共财产的损坏和耗费，实是新民主主义经济建设中一个凶恶的敌人，对于这些现象的容忍放任，熟视无楮，无异对革命事业犯罪。
    社论指出，造成这些现象的思想原因，主要的是长期在分散的，乡村的、游击战争的环境中所养成的游击习气、本位主义、狭隘的财政观点，以致在处理国家财产与公共财产的时候，没有整体观念，没有统一观念，没有计划观念，其结果，就不自觉地为了本单位的局部利益，破坏了整个的利益。再夹杂一些非无产阶级的思想——小生产者的散漫性，破坏性，自私心理与纨绔子弟不事生计的挥霍习气反映到革命队伍中来，就更加重了这类破坏现象与浪费现象。因此，保护国家财产与公共财产，是必须通过严重的思想斗争，才能达到目的。
    联系这一斗争，要加强整个财经工作中的计划性，力求做到真正的统一与集中。如果财政经济系统中的各自为政的状态不克服，那末，破坏与浪费现象还是不能完全消灭的。
    同时要严密国家财产的保护方法与管理制度。政权机关与经济机关必须订出保护与管理国家财产与公共财产的制度，颁布反对破坏与浪费公有财产的法令，订出严厉的制裁办法。一时不能复工的工厂和一时不能修复的房屋等等都需要专人看管，不要为节省此比较小的开支而任其破坏，反使国家受到更大的损失。每个工厂，每个机关，每个学校必须将一切国家财产及公共财产加以登记，定期检查，财产之保管与使用必须责职分明，赏罚严明。
    联系这一斗争，还必须造成大规模的、群众性的、保护国家财产的运动。动员群众，首先是工人阶级去和一切破坏与浪费的现象作斗争。必须充分理解与发挥工人阶级对生产建设事业的积极性。
    最后在保护国家财产的工作中必须大大提高我们的警惕性，加强保卫锄奸工作，防止反革命敌探特务的阴谋破坏。
    社论指出，革命人民从反革命手里夺回自己所创造的城市、工业和铁路，曾经付出了巨大的代价，许多同志曾因此而贡献了自己的生命。我们现有的这些财产，不但是劳动人民血与汗的结晶，而且是革命英雄血与汗的结晶。因此保护国家财产和公共财产是每个工人、农民、知识分子、共产党员，公务人员和人民解放战士及一切民主人士的神圣的革命的责任。
