Mr. Shang Yue, Member of the China Democratic League
　Introduction to Representatives of the People of North China, Part Three

　　Mr. Shang Yue, a member of the China Democratic League, said at the opening ceremony of the conference: "Participating in the conference as a member of the China Democratic League and being elected as one of the members of the presidium is the most proud and glorious thing in my forty-five years of life. Because the conference is a conference for the people to create a new history, and participating in this conference is also participating in the great cause of creating a new history and a new world."

　　Mr. Shang is from Luoshan County, Henan Province. He was a professor at Yunnan University and joined the China Democratic League in 1943, participating in leading the democratic movement in the Southwest. After Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo were brutally assassinated by the Kuomintang reactionaries, he was forced to come to the Liberated Areas at the end of 1946. He first taught at Shandong University and then transferred to the Research Office of North China University. He is currently a professor at North China University.

　　When Mr. Shang talked to reporters about the situation of Shi Lei, a student of North China University, running for the representative of the people of North China, he said: Shi Lei is not a member of the Communist Party. In this election of more than 1,000 voters in Huabei University, he actually won the election and was elected as the representative of the people. This shows that there is true democracy only under the leadership of the Communist Party. Based on personal experience, he firmly stated that the China Democratic League can only achieve its goal of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism and building a prosperous and happy New China by establishing the closest and most solid united front with the Chinese Communist Party.

　　民盟盟员尚钺先生
  　华北人民代表介绍之三
    民主同盟盟员尚钺先生在大会开幕典礼上说：“以民盟盟员资格参加大会，并被选为主席团之一，是自己生平四十五年来最可骄傲的光荣。因为大会是人民创造新历史的大会，参加了这次大会，也就是参加了创造新历史新世界的大事业。”
    尚先生河南罗山县人，曾任云南大学教授，于一九四三年加入民主同盟，参加领导西南民主运动。在李公朴、闻一多两先生惨遭国民党反动派暗杀后，被迫于一九四六年底来解放区。先在山东大学任教，后转入北方大学研究室工作，现任华北大学教授。
    尚先生与记者谈及华北大学学生石磊竞选华北人民代表的情形时说：石磊并不是共产党员，此次在华大的一千多学校选民选举中，他竟赢得了选举，当选为人民代表。这表明只有在共产党领导下才有真正的民主。根据亲身的体验，他坚决地表示：民盟只有和中共建立最密切巩固的联合战线，才能达到自己反帝反封建、建立富强康乐的新中国的目的。
