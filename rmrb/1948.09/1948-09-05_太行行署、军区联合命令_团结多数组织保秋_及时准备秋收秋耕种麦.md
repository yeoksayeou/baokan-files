Taihang Administrative Office, Military Region Joint Order
　Unite the Majority to Organize Autumn Protection
　Promptly Prepare for Autumn Harvest, Autumn Planting, and Wheat Sowing
[Taihang Telegraph] In order to welcome the autumn protection struggle in northern Henan, the Taihang Administrative Office and Military Region issued a joint order on August 22. The basic task of this year's autumn protection struggle is to further mobilize and organize the masses in the border and guerrilla areas on the basis of the victory of the summer harvest struggle, and to carry out a full-scale autumn protection struggle. To achieve this task, it is necessary to continue to implement correction of deviations, correct policies, unite the masses, consolidate and expand the united front against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit border areas, and isolate the enemy. Regarding the specific implementation of tasks, in addition to the army doing a good job in preparation, each special and county should also hold special meetings to discuss the plan, steps and methods of autumn harvest and grain storage. In the general, in-depth and specific mobilization, in addition to pointing out the reasons for the victory of the summer harvest struggle, it is necessary to recognize that the task of the autumn harvest struggle will be longer and more arduous than the summer harvest, so it is necessary to be vigilant and overcome complacency, luck, and paralysis. In addition, it is necessary to recognize that the autumn harvest struggle is a general and widespread struggle, but it must be organized with emphasis and closely combined with the strength of all parties. Under unified leadership, with the autumn protection struggle as the central task, launch an offensive against the enemy and a struggle to protect grain and manpower. Under the general principle of winning the autumn protection struggle, establish county and district headquarters with the county as the unit, with the county and district cadres as the backbone, combined with militia, armed work teams, and other armed organizations, and go deep into the enemy area and near strongholds to disrupt the enemy's transportation, strike the enemy's transportation, crush the enemy's grain robbery, destroy the enemy's bunkers, and annihilate the enemy. In addition, the county and district headquarters should strengthen intelligence and mobilize the masses to disintegrate the enemy. In particular, we must give play to the experience of the masses in the past struggle against grain requisition and prevent the view of simply relying on arms. In the autumn protection struggle, the leadership should constantly supervise, inspect and sum up experience, and promptly commend and criticize. Prevent self-flow and the phenomenon of being tight at the beginning and loose at the end.
　[Taihang Telegraph] The Beginning of Autumn has passed, and the season for autumn harvest, autumn cultivation, and wheat planting is approaching. In order to do a good job in preparation and carry out the autumn harvest, autumn cultivation, and wheat planting movement, the Taihang Administrative Office has issued the following instructions: (1) Publicize that when land certificates are issued this winter, only minor adjustments of land will be combined with the correction of deviations, and there will be no large-scale withdrawal and replenishment, filling in and making up. Those who have not made adjustments before autumn cultivation and wheat planting, such as minor land changes, will have whoever plants the wheat, who harvests it, and those who only cultivate but do not plant will also give the original owner compensation for wages and fertilizers. At the same time, it is necessary to carry out production education, eliminate ideological obstacles, and restore and develop the large-scale production movement. (2) In addition to continuing to implement fertilizer accumulation, labor exchange organizations for people and animals should be organized to carry out autumn harvest, autumn cultivation, and wheat planting in a planned manner. Mutual aid organizations should truly be voluntary combinations, in various organizational forms that are welcomed and loved by the masses. (3) Wheat seed adjustments must be organized, and the selection of autumn crops should be promoted. Break the conservative, backward and unscientific psychology of the masses. And organize the masses to purchase red alum asphalt and other insecticides, and promote seed disinfection as a necessary step to restore and improve agricultural technology. (4) Attention must be paid to the season, oppose formalism, and harvest in a timely manner, and seize the time to "turn over" the land and sow in a timely manner. For some narrow experiences that do not reach harvest according to the season, patient persuasion and education should be carried out. (5) Border areas should rectify the militia, repair weapons, appropriately solve the difficulties of the militia in autumn harvest, autumn cultivation, and wheat planting, stipulate specific methods for the combination of labor and military work, and maintain close contact with local armed forces to prepare to defend the autumn harvest, grab cultivation, and grab planting.

    【太行电】立秋已过，秋收、秋耕、种麦节令即将到来。为了做好准备工作，开展秋收秋耕种麦运动，太行行署特作如下指示：（一）宣传今冬发土地证时，只结合纠偏和进行小部分之土地调剂，不再大抽大补，填平补齐。秋耕、种麦前未进行调剂者，如少数土地变动，已种麦者是谁种谁收，只耕不种者也给原主以工资肥料之补偿。同时要进行生产教育，扫清思想障碍，恢复与发展大生产运动。（二）除继续贯彻积肥外，应组织人畜力变工组织，有计划的进行秋收、秋耕和种麦。互助组织应真正的是自愿结合，各种各样为群众所欢喜乐意的组织形式。（三）必须组织麦种调剂，提倡秋庄稼选种。打破群众保守落后不相信科学的心理。并组织群众购买红矾柏油等除虫药剂，提倡种子消毒，做为恢复与提高农业技术的必要步骤。（四）必须注意节令，反对形式主义，要应时收割，抓紧“垡”地应时下种。对某些不按节令达到收成的狭隘经验作法，要耐心说服教育。（五）边沿区要整顿民兵修整武器，适当解决民兵秋收、秋耕、种麦困难，规定劳武结合变工的具体办法与地方武装取得密切联系，准备保卫秋收、抢耕、抢种。
