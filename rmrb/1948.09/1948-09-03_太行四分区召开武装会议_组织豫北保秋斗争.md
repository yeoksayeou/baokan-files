	Taihang Fourth Military Subdistrict Convenes Armed Conference
	Organizes Autumn Harvest Defense Struggle in Northern Henan
	[Taihang Electric] The Taihang Fourth Military Subdistrict Military Commission convened a joint meeting of county military commission directors at the beginning of the month to discuss strengthening the construction of the people's armed forces and prepare for the autumn harvest defense struggle. The meeting first reviewed the armed work of the first half of the year, finding that the composition of the militia was basically pure, the relationship with the masses was closer than before, and the previous undisciplined and bad work style had been basically overcome. After a short-term training of more than 1,700 border area armed cadres, militia, and demolition experts in late April, the awareness of the people's armed forces was generally improved, the will to fight was firm, and the phenomenon of desertion was eliminated. The meeting focused on studying and determining the tasks of the people's armed forces construction before and after the autumn harvest. In terms of organizational construction: conduct immediate scientific and rational rectification, distinguish between general militia and expeditionary militia, reorganize them, and perform their respective duties. The meeting pointed out that due to certain "left-leaning" and adventurous deviations this spring, the number of militia has been greatly reduced. Now, special efforts should be made to strengthen the work of restoring and consolidating the militia. A large number of armed cadres should be trained and cultivated, and each county should conduct a collective training of key village cadres before the autumn harvest, mainly to clarify their thinking; the sub-district military commission is preparing to train district cadres once and cultivate a group of district-level reserve cadres. The meeting studied the sources of ideological confusion among the militia: (1) A small number of militia members do not understand current affairs and policies, and have shaken and pessimistic sentiments, feeling that there is no future. (2) Conflicts with family interests, excessive work delays, inability to produce well, and no work points for participating in the war. (3) Leading cadres do not care for the militia, issue administrative orders, have a purely utilitarian viewpoint, and fight adventurous battles. Based on the above situation, it was determined that in the future it is necessary to strengthen current affairs and policy education, strengthen organization and discipline, and establish a set of political life systems. At the same time, it is necessary to solve the militia's production problems and resolutely implement the system of work points for participating in the war; the best way is to earnestly implement the combination of labor and military affairs. Finally, the meeting studied tactical issues and decided to thoroughly change the two tactics of right-leaning retreat and defense and head-on confrontation. We must promote landmine explosions and outsmarting the enemy. In order to carry out the "ten thousand landmine explosion" campaign during the autumn harvest defense, each county must send personnel to be specifically responsible for training demolition experts, dividing minefields, and changing the passive burying of defensive mines to actively burying offensive mines in front, while combining with combat activities and turning "dead mines" into "live mines." Combine with the interests of the masses, and do not damage the crops of the masses. Each county should hold small-scale explosion research conferences to exchange experience and improve technology.

　　太行四分区召开武装会议
  　组织豫北保秋斗争
    【太行电】太行四分区武委会于月初召开县武委会主任联席会议，讨论加强人民武装建设，迎接保秋斗争。会议首先检查了前半年的武装工作，发现民兵成份基本上是纯洁的，与群众关系较前密切，基本上克服了过去无纪律的恶劣作风。四月下旬短期训练了一千七百余边地武装干部、民兵、爆炸手等后，人民武装的觉悟普遍提高，斗争意志坚定，根绝了逃亡现象。会议着重研究与确定了保秋前后人民武装建设的任务。在组织建设上：立即进行科学合理的整顿，分别一般民兵与远征民兵两种，重新编制，各司其职。会议指出：由于今春犯了某些左倾冒险的偏向，民兵数量大减。现应特别加强恢复与巩固民兵的工作。大批训练与培养武装干部，各县保秋前要将主要村干集训一次，主要是澄清思想；分区武委会准备将区干训练一次，并培养一批区级预备干部。会议研究了民兵思想混乱的来源：（一）少数民兵对时事和政策不了解，发生动摇悲观情绪，觉得无前途。（二）与家庭利益矛盾，误工特别多，不能好好生产，参战又不顶工。（三）领导干部不爱护民兵，行政命令，单纯使用观点，打冒险的仗。根据上述情况，确定今后必须加强时事政策教育，加强组织性纪律性，建立一套政治生活制度。同时必须解决民兵生产问题，坚决执行参战顶工制；最好的办法是认真实行劳武结合。最后研究战术问题，会议决定要彻底转变右倾退缩防守与牛抵角硬顶硬的两种战术。要发扬地雷爆炸与斗智。为了开展保秋中的万雷爆炸运动，每县必须派人专门负责训练爆炸手，划分雷区，把消极的埋防御雷改变为积极到前边埋进攻雷，同时与战斗活动结合，变死雷为活雷。与群众利益结合，不能损害群众庄稼。各县应开小型爆炸研究会，交流经验提高技术。
