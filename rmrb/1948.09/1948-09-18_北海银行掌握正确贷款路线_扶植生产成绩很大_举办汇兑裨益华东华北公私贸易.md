Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th. The Beihai Bank of Shandong has made remarkable achievements in coordinating disaster relief and supporting production in the past six months. In the first half of the year, it issued a total of 11.3 billion yuan in various loans. When the Bohai Branch of the bank issued spring loans in disaster areas this spring, it emphasized both agriculture and sideline occupations. One aspect was to help solve problems such as wheat seed and farm tools; the other was to support sideline production to solve the problem of food rations for farmers and livestock feeding. In the waterlogged areas, five counties in the third district alone issued 1.1 million catties of wheat seeds, of which Boxin County issued more than 430,000 catties, which could be planted on more than 32,000 mu, yielding about 6.5 million catties. Guangrao County issued loans of more than 50 million yuan, together with the sideline loans of more than 40 million yuan granted to cooperatives last year, and combined with private funds from the masses, it added more than 2,200 head of livestock this spring. The increase in livestock has not only strengthened sideline transportation in the waterlogged areas of northern Guangrao, helping them overcome the spring famine, but also guaranteed the smooth completion of this year's production. In general loans, 880,000 catties of coarse grains and 88.8 million Beihai currency were issued for the fishing and salt industries, combined with some funds from the fishing and salt farmers' cooperatives, to solve the difficulties of grain for salt farmers and fishing nets and other production tools for fishermen. The original 1,046 salt fields in Wudi and Zhanhua counties increased to 1,579 after the loans; and the output increased from 75 million catties to 300 million catties. Because the loans truly solved the difficulties for farmers, when the loans were due, the farmers actively returned them with dry, good grain.
　　The issuance of agricultural loans has basically grasped the correct policy line. According to statistics from the four regions of Jiaodong, Luzhong, Binhai, and Binbei, a total of more than 290,000 households received loans, of which poor and hired peasants accounted for 83.58 percent, middle peasants accounted for 14.28 percent, and other components accounted for 2.14 percent. However, many cadres have insufficient understanding of agricultural loans, limiting their work to weighing grain, delivering money, and grasping procedural affairs, while relaxing the central link of correctly determining loan households and loans through the mass line.
　　In stabilizing finance and regulating prices, the bank has also achieved significant results in the past six months by cooperating with industrial and commercial departments. In the first half of the year, prices in the Shandong Liberated Area rose by only 66 percent; while in the same period, general prices in Qingdao, which was occupied by the enemy, rose more than eight times.
　　The bank has decided to add 100 million catties of grain to the agricultural loan in-kind fund in its future rural financial work, together with the existing in-kind fund, to vigorously carry out agricultural loan work, and to combine agricultural loans with organizing the masses' labor and funds to engage in production work. The issuance of agricultural loans will be based on the amount of production materials that farmers must help in their planned production, and will be issued on a priority basis according to the strength of the bank. The target of issuance is generally poor and middle peasants, but landlords who actively participate in labor after land reform and rich peasants who have been removed from feudal and semi-feudal exploitation may be given loans with the consent of the masses if they lack production funds and cannot solve the problem themselves. At the same time, loans must be repaid with interest. The agricultural loan interest rate is set at 1.5 percent per month for both in-kind and cash loans starting from this autumn loan, and the interest rate for fishing, salt or other sideline loans is 1.5 percent for in-kind and 1.8 percent for cash. In addition, it is planned to select appropriate locations to help establish mass-based credit cooperatives in rural areas, create experience, and serve as a demonstration for the future development direction of rural banking business. Regarding urban financial work, in the future, public and private industrial and commercial enterprises and transportation industries will be given loans according to their relationship to the national economy and people's livelihood, and mass small-scale loans and cooperative loans will be issued at the same time, and deposit and loan business will be carried out, and remittance business will be established to promote the development of industry and commerce. The Shandong Beihai Bank currently has 145 branches, sub-branches, and offices, of which 50 were added in the first half of this year.
Xinhua News Agency, East China, 12th. The remittance business of Shandong Beihai Bank started on September 1st. It is tentatively set that 25 locations including Huaxian County, Shahe (under Yexian County), Longkou, Shidao, Huimin, Dezhou, Boshan, Zhoucun, Qiandou, and Taian will be the focus of interbank remittance, and Dezhou is designated as the transshipment point between the two major liberated areas of North China and East China. Remittance is divided into two types: bill remittance and telegraphic transfer. Bill remittance is the issuance of a bill of exchange by the local interbank bank, and the payee can collect the money from the paying bank with the bill of exchange; telegraphic transfer is the direct notification of the payee by the bank (the bank charges postage) to collect the money from the paying bank. Remittance fee: 3 per thousand within 200 li, 6 per thousand above 500 li; the highest remittance fee does not exceed 150,000 yuan at a time (if it exceeds, it will still be charged according to 150,000 yuan), and the lowest is not less than 500 yuan. The maximum remittance limit is tentatively set at 10 million yuan. If it is more than 10 million yuan, you must talk to the bank and agree to indicate installment payment on the bill of exchange. This move by Beihai Bank is of great benefit to the public and private trade and capital flow between the two regions of East China and North China.

　　北海银行掌握正确贷款路线
  　扶植生产成绩很大
    举办汇兑裨益华东华北公私贸易
    【新华社华东十三日电】山东北海银行半年来配合救灾，扶植生产，成绩卓著。上半年共发放各种贷款达一百十三亿元。该行渤海分行今春在灾区发放春季贷款时，农业副业并重，一则帮助解决大麦种、农具等问题；一则扶持副业生产，解决农民的口粮及饲养牲口等问题。在水涝区域仅三分区五个县就发放了一百一十万斤麦种，其中博兴一个县发放了四十三万余斤，可种三万二千多市亩，约收获六百五十余万斤。广饶县发放了五千余万元贷款，连同去年贷给合作社之副业贷款四千余万元，并结合群众私资，于今春新添牲口二千二百余头。牲口的增加，不但使广饶北部水涝区增强副业运输，渡过春荒，且保证了今年生产顺利完成。在一般贷款中，渔盐业贷款发放了八十八万斤粗粮及北海币八千八百余万元，结合渔盐民合作社一部资金，解决盐民粮食及渔民的渔网渔杆等生产工具的困难。无棣、沾化两县原有一千零四十六付盐滩，经贷款后增到一千五百七十九付；产量由七千五百万斤增产到三万万斤。由于贷款真正为农民解决困难，所以贷款到期收回时，农民均以干、好粮食，踊跃交还。
    农贷的发放基本上掌握了正确的政策路线。据胶东、鲁中、滨海、滨北四个地区的统计，得贷款户共二十九万余户，其中贫雇农占百分之八三·五八，中农占百分之一四·二八，其他成份占百分之二·一四。但也有许多干部对农贷的认识不足，把工作限制在秤粮、送款与掌握手续的事务工作上，而放松了通过群众路线来正确确定贷户与贷款这一中心环节。
    银行在稳定金融调节物价上，半年来与工商部门协力，亦取得极显著成绩。上半年山东解放区物价仅上升百分之六十六；而同一时期敌占之青岛一般物价则上涨八倍多。
    该行确定今后在农村金融工作上，新增加农贷实物基金一万万斤粮食，连同旧有实物基金，大力开展农贷工作，并使农贷与组织群众劳力、资金从事生产工作相结合。农贷的发放将一面依据农民计划生产中必须帮助的生产资料数额，一回依据银行的力量实行重点发放。发放对象一般是贫雇中农，但土改后积极参加劳动的地主与已除去封建半封建剥削的富农，当缺乏生产资金自己又无法解决时，经群众同意，并酌予贷款。同时贷款要做到有借有还，并收一定利息。农贷利息确定自今年秋贷开始实物现金贷放，均为月息一分五厘，渔盐或其他副业贷款利息，实物为一分五，现金为一分八。此外准备选择适当地点，扶助建立农村中群众性的信用合作社，创造经验，以作今后农村银行业务发展方向的示范。关于城市金融工作，今后对公私营工商业，运输业，根据其对国计民生之关系如何，分别轻重予以贷款，同时发放群众性小本贷款及合作贷款，开展存放款业务，建立汇兑业务，以促进工商业之发展。按山东北海银行现有分行、支行与办事处共一百四十五个，其中于今年上半年增加的有五十个。
    【新华社华东十二日电】山东北海银行举办汇兑业务业于九月一日开始。暂定化县、沙河（属掖县）、龙口、石岛、惠民、德州、博山、周村、签都、泰安等二十五处为通汇焦点，并指定以德州为华北与华东两大解放区之转汇点。汇兑分票汇与信汇两种，票汇系由当地通汇银行发给汇票，由收款人持汇票向付款行领款；信汇系由银行直接通知收款人（银行加收挂号邮资）向付款行领款。汇费：二百里以内千分之三，五百里以上千分之六；汇费最高一次不超过十五万元（如超过仍按十五万元照收），最低不低于五百元。汇款最高限额暂定为一千万元。如在一千万元以上得与银行面谈，商定在汇票上注明分期付款。北行此举，对华东华北两区公私贸易，资金流转裨益甚大。
