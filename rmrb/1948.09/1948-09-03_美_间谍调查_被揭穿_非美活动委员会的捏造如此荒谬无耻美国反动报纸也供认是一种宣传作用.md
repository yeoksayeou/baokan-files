Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. Reports from various sources: The absurd uproar of the "spy investigation" manufactured by the House Un-American Activities Committee, controlled by the US Republican Party, has been miserably exposed. Since July 30, the committee, based on the fabrications of a neurotic female swindler, Bentley, who became an FBI agent before the war and claimed to be a "Soviet spy," has successively summoned several officials from the Roosevelt administration and announced that it would separately summon people who support the Progressive Party, creating a "spy terror" on a large scale. According to Wallace, former Undersecretary of the Treasury White died on the 16th after being tortured by the committee after being summoned. Recently, the committee has fabricated ridiculous claims such as "Truman hiding evidence of Soviet spies" and Columbia University President Eisenhower "accepting money from the Communist intelligence bureau." Because their fabrications are so absurd and shameless that many reactionary American newspapers have said that this is a propaganda effect, and even Truman, who once ordered the arrest of the American Communist leaders based on Bentley's slander, has, seeing that this "investigation" by the committee is not only aimed at attacking the progressive forces, but also at attacking him, had to declare again on the 19th that he disagreed with the congressional "spy investigation" and denounced it as a violation of human rights.

American Progressive Party presidential candidate Wallace recently pointed out in his radio address that the House Un-American Activities Committee represents the interests of international capitalists and arms dealers, whose profits increase or decrease entirely according to the degree of world crisis and white terror, and that they are the real huge threat that needs to be stopped. Four famous black leaders in the United States—singer Robeson, historian Du Bois, politician Howard, and "Black Communications" newspaper editor Dungee—and a group of famous writers, artists, and scientists issued a statement on the 23rd opposing the creation of hysteria and demanding the immediate cessation of the House Un-American Activities Committee's hearings, pointing out that this is an "attempt to strengthen the recent war propaganda and the general reactionary movement by threatening all political opposition."

　　美“间谍调查”被揭穿
  　非美活动委员会的捏造如此荒谬无耻美国反动报纸也供认是一种宣传作用
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】各方报导：美国共和党控制下的众院非美活动委员会所制造的“间谍调查”的荒诞喧嚣，已被悲惨地揭穿了。该委员会自七月三十日以来，即根据早于战前即成为联邦调查局特务的一个神经质女骗子，自称为“苏联间谍”的班特丽的捏造，先后传讯了若干罗斯福政府时代的官员，并宣布将另行传讯支持进步党的人士，大肆制造“间谍恐怖”。据华莱士宣称：前财次怀特在被传讯后，已于十六日被该委员会折磨致死。最近，该委员会又造出“杜鲁门隐藏苏联间谍的证据”，和哥伦比亚大学校长艾森豪威尔“接受共产党情报局金钱”的无聊谰言。由于他们的捏造如此荒谬与无耻，以致许多美国反动报纸也说出这是一种宣传作用，甚至曾根据班特丽诬陷而下令逮捕美共领袖的杜鲁门，在见及该委员会这种“调查”，不但旨在打击进步势力，而且也打击到他自己头上时，亦不得不于十九日再度声明不同意国会的“间谍调查”，并斥之为违反人权。
    美进步党总统候选人华莱士最近在其广播演说中指出：非美活动委员会是国际资本家及军火商利益的代表，他们利润的增减完全根据世界危机和白色恐怖的程度而定，他们才是真正的巨大威胁，需要予以制止。美四位著名黑人领袖——歌王罗伯逊、历史学家杜波斯、政治家郝瓦德及“黑人通讯”报编辑邓基，及一群著名作家、艺术家、科学家，均于二十三日发表声明，反对制造歇斯底里，并要求迅速停止非美活动委员会的审讯，并指出这是“企图用威胁所有政治反对派来加强最近的战争宣传与一般的反动运动”。
