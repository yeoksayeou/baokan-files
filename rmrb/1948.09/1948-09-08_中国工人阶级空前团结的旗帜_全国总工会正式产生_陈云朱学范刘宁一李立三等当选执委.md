Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 5th. The Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was formally elected at the Labor Congress on the 20th of last month. From now on, the unified and highest leading body of the national labor movement has been established. Prior to the election, Comrade Li Lisan, on behalf of the presidium of the congress, explained the significance of the election and the presidium's proposals for the election principles. He stated: The election of the highest leading body of the national working class mass organization is the final agenda item of the Labor Congress; and for the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, it is the first item on the agenda, a great beginning. The establishment of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is not only the organizational unification of the national working class, but will also transform the unified thought and unified will of the congress into unified action. Therefore, the presidium of the congress proposed: (1) It is hoped that the elected executive committee members of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (referred to as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions hereinafter) will include representatives from democratic trade unions in various regions of the country and representatives who truly have prestige among the working masses; at the same time, it is hoped that not only will representatives of manual laborers be elected, but also representatives of mental laborers—clerks, technicians, and administrative management personnel. The presidium especially hopes to pay attention to the election of labor heroes and production models, because they can play a great mobilizing role among the working class; (2) In order to take care of the above points, the presidium proposed that the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions consist of 81 members, including 59 official members and 22 alternate members; (3) It is proposed to leave 8 vacancies (6 official and 2 alternate) so that workers from newly liberated cities can have representatives to participate in the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions during the period from this congress to the next congress. The above proposals were unanimously approved by the audience. The congress also unanimously approved that, due to the different numbers of worker members represented by the delegates from various regions attending the meeting, each 2,000 members would be counted as one vote. The number of votes for each delegate from each delegation is as follows: China Labor Association and the Kuomintang-controlled area delegation each had 17 votes; the Northwest delegation had 5 votes each; the North China delegation had 8 votes each; the Northeast delegation had 1 vote each; the East China delegation had 10 votes each; and the Liangguang delegation had 1 vote each. A total of 1,440 votes. The number of votes for elected executive committee members must exceed one-half of the total number of votes; if the number of elected executive committee members is less than the fixed number, a supplementary election will be held. The election method was direct secret ballot.
    The election results are as follows:
