Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd. In order to unify the Party's actions and oppose the state of disorganization and indiscipline within the Party, the struggle carried out by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has been launched in a certain unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army front. The Party Committee of the unit held an enlarged meeting a few days ago and decided to conduct ideological examination from top to bottom among leaders at all levels of the unit to correct some of the current state of disorganization and indiscipline. At the meeting, the Party Committee first reviewed that since the Party Central Committee put forward the opposition to anarchism and indiscipline, emphasized centralization and unity, and issued the resolution on the South Communist issue, although the unit has conveyed it to cadres at all levels and carried out some publicity and education at various meetings; the leading organs have never raised this issue of ideological construction with a Party-wide nature to the central link, and have not taken a certain amount of time to organize ideological reviews from top to bottom and fully launch ideological struggle. This is a concrete manifestation of extreme indiscipline to keep some important instructions of the Central Committee at the level of verbal propaganda. The Party Committee then pointed out the specific manifestations of disorganization and indiscipline in the unit. On the one hand, the general cadres lack research on the Party's policies and instructions from superiors, and there are habits of being rough and not seeking thorough understanding, as well as certain purely military viewpoints, lax military discipline, and chaotic systems; on the other hand, cadres at all levels have failed to regard making comprehensive reports to superiors as a matter of organizational concept and discipline. They do not have sufficient understanding of the great importance of reporting comprehensive information to superiors so that superiors can make various instructions in a timely manner and correct shortcomings in time, so that the work does not make or makes fewer mistakes. They think that as long as they act according to the instructions of their superiors, it does not matter if they do not report, or they use the excuse of not being able to write comprehensive reports, and some even have the idea of "rather report less than report wrong." They often only rush to deal with it under the strict supervision of their superiors, so that it often happens that only the process is reported, lacking analysis or summary, or even only the beginning is reported and not the result. The objective reasons for these problems, in addition to the weak ability of the cadres, also lie in the fact that the leading organs do not conduct in-depth investigation and research on the situation, the instructions and plans for the subordinates are not carefully considered, there is a lot of work and the center is not clear, the requirements for work are not strict, problems cannot be investigated in time, and there is a lack of strict work discipline. Therefore, the Party Committee of the unit called on cadres at all levels to go deep into their work and make more comprehensive reports to their superiors, and especially decided to launch an ideological struggle against anarchism and indiscipline and various bad work styles in the troops, and conduct in-depth inspections in connection with the implementation of policies, systems, and military discipline. The focus of the inspection is on the Party committees above the regiment level and the main cadres and organs, carrying out strict criticism and self-criticism, and exposing the phenomena of anarchism and indiscipline and the shortcomings of leadership methods.

　　东北某部党委召开扩大会议
  　检查无政府无纪律思想
    【新华社东北二十二日电】中共中央为了统一党的行动，反对党内无组织无纪律状态所进行的斗争，在东北人民解放军前线某部中展开了。该部党委会于日前召开扩大会议，决定在该部各级领导中进行从上而下的思想检查，以纠正目前存在着的某些无组织无纪律状态。会上，党委首先检讨自党中央提出反对无政府无纪律状态，强调集中统一，及发表关于南共问题的决议以来，该部虽对各级干部进行了传达，在各种会议上进行了一些宣传教育；但领导机关始终未把这一带有全党性的思想建设问题提高到中心环节的地位，拿出一定时间来组织自上而下的思想检讨，全力展开思想斗争。这是把中央的一些重要指示停留在口头宣传上，是一种极无纪律的具体表现。党委继即指出该部无组织无纪律状态的具体表现，一方面是：一般干部对党的政策、上级指示缺乏研究，存在着粗枝大叶不求甚解的习惯，及某些单纯军事观点、军纪松懈、制度紊乱等；另一方面是：各级干部未能把对上级作综合报告看成是组织观念和纪律问题。他们对于向上级反映全面情况，以便使上级能适时作出各种指示和及时纠正缺点，使工作不犯或少犯错误的巨大重要性认识不够，以为只要按照上级所指示的去作，不报告也没关系，或以不会写综合报告作借口，有的并存在着“宁少报，不报错”的想法。他们又往往只是在上级严格督促下才急于应付，以至经常发生只报告经过，缺乏分析或总结，甚至只报告开始不报告结果等等毛病。产生这些毛病的客观原因，除干部能力弱外，还在于领导机关对情况不作深入的调查研究致对，下级的指示、计划考虑不细致，工作多，中心不明确，对工作要求不严，发生问题不能及时追究，缺乏严格的工作纪律。因此，该部党委号召各级干部深入工作，对上级多作综合报告，并特别决定在部队中展开反对无政府无纪律状态及各种恶劣作风的思想斗争，联系执行政策、制度、军纪的情形作深入的检查。检查重点放在团以上党委及主要干部与机关部门，开展严格的批评与自我批评，揭发无政府无纪律的现象与领导方法的缺点。
