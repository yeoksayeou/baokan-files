　　To Comrade Wang Yongze of Jinan, Hebei: The issue of your sauce garden in Hejin Town, Wu'an, being liquidated by the shop assistants has been transferred to the Wu'an County Committee for investigation and handling. You will be notified of the results later.
　　To Comrade Xingmin of Gaoyi Post Office: Wang Shunshun, a woman from the East and West Han Villages in the Third District of Gaoyi, picked up a bundle of People's Daily newspapers lost by the Shijiazhuang postal vehicle and immediately reported it to the district cadre. This spirit of cherishing newspapers and not pocketing found items is worthy of everyone's emulation.
　　To Comrade Cheng Shutong of Anguo Electric Light Company: Regarding the issue of your family being swept out of your home during the land reform, and the village cadres refusing to return it despite the commissioner's office sending a letter, we have asked the Eighth Administrative Office of Central Hebei to inspect and urge them to do so.
