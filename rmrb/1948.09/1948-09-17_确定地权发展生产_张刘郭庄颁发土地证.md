[Ji Zhong Electric] Zhang Liuguozhuang in Shen County fairly and reasonably distributed land and floating wealth during the Qingming Festival earlier this year. The seven middle-peasant households whose interests were violated due to misclassification of class status also received compensation in April. The county party committee then decided to issue land certificates in this village to create experience. The issuance began on August 14th and partially completed by early September. The working process and experience are introduced as follows:

What are some of the problems encountered when issuing land certificates?

At the beginning, the village peasant representative conference was used to spread the news of issuing land certificates throughout the village. From the brewing process, we understood that the masses had different ideas and requirements: poor peasants and well-to-do middle peasants were very happy, and landlords and rich peasants were also happy. Poor peasant Zhang Liancai said: "Based solely on official documents and seals, I was allocated six mu of land, without any license. This time, with the land certificate issued, I can be more assured in farming." Well-to-do middle peasant Zhang Baoshen said: "With the land certificate issued, I won't feel so uneasy about farming." Landlord Zhang Gengquan and rich peasant Zhang Zhongxun, because they were not called to participate in the mass meeting, randomly found cadres after the meeting to ask: "Will you issue land certificates to us? With the land certificate issued, our own things will be secure." Some middle peasants were not enthusiastic about issuing land certificates, some said: "Our land has already been taxed and deeded, why bother with that trouble?" Old middle peasants Zhang Ruxian and Zhang Ruiyan said: "Let's exchange it if we're told to, anyway, we're following the trend!" Some thought they would have to pay deed tax, so they had concerns. (According to usual circumstances, in areas where land reform has been completed, the government's issuance of land certificates to determine land rights must be supported by all classes, but the middle peasants in Zhang Liuguozhuang are not active. In addition to "trouble," are there other reasons? Whether correcting misclassified class status and compensating middle peasants have some outstanding issues that have not been resolved, resulting in dissatisfaction among middle peasants? Local leaders should pay attention to in-depth inspection – Editor). In order to unify the masses' understanding of issuing land certificates and discover specific problems, various meetings were held continuously. First, a village-wide mass meeting was held, proposing: (1) Determine land rights to reassure all classes to engage in production, abolish old documents, and ensure men and women have equal economic status. (2) After the land reform, everyone has a share of land. Should land certificates be issued to each individual or to the whole family? You can convene a family meeting to discuss and determine, to achieve family unity and harmony. (3) Issuing land certificates does not require deed tax. Finally, everyone was called upon to raise any land disputes they might have. Secondly, a village-wide women's congress and different women's forums were convened. Later, small group meetings were held among the masses, casually discussing the specific issues in issuing land certificates: 1. All land that has not been measured must be measured. 2. How to issue land certificates for land without contracts. 3. What if the area of land with contracts is less than actual. 4. Most of the villagers do not have contracts, and some have incorrect sizes due to family division. How to issue? 5. If land certificates are issued to each person in the family, it is not easy to distribute the good and bad land evenly. Therefore, the majority opinion is to write the names of all family members on one certificate. Some groups proposed to only write the name of the head of the household, followed by the number of men and women in the whole family.

In order to complete this task, a "Land Certificate Issuance Committee" was established, and a committee and chairman and vice-chairman were elected. Based on the actual situation of land issues in the village, it was decided to establish propaganda, measurement, registration and accounting, and problem-solving groups, each with a group leader and a number of members according to the workload of each group. After the meeting, the radio station was used to inform the whole village of the organization for issuing land certificates, and asked each household to prepare their contracts for registration.

The work of each group was combined to mobilize the masses to solve disputes themselves. At the beginning, door-to-door registration was carried out. In order to create experience, on the first day, only one group (cadres of the registration group) carried out demonstration registration in one neighborhood. Because the publicity and preparation work was not good, some people were unwilling to discard the old contracts and refused to register. As a result, only eleven households were registered in one day. That night, a meeting of all cadres was held to discuss the issue of not having contracts and how to proceed with the work the next day. Everyone unanimously agreed to respect the village's custom of "giving priority to those with written contracts, and giving priority to red deed land." After this decision was made, it was immediately broadcast throughout the village, urging everyone to quickly prepare their documents. When the measurement group started measuring land, many people requested measurement. Some households whose land had no problems also requested measurement to feel at ease. At this time, the measurement group called on the masses to measure themselves. The measurement group only measured the land of households whose disputes could not be resolved. Many people measured their own land. Because the masses had accumulated problems for many years, some problems that had been solved earlier were overturned, so many problems could not be cleared up. At this time, the problem-solving group explained to the masses: Problems do not necessarily have to be solved by the problem-solving group, everyone can help each other to solve them. Later, many people solved the problems themselves. Only problems that the masses could not solve were brought to the problem-solving group. After more than ten days, the problem-solving group handled forty problems. The measurement group also measured the land that had to be measured and handed it over to the registration and accounting group for registration and conversion to new mu.

Because the autumn harvest had arrived, the registration and accounting could not be fully completed. In order to demonstrate the experience of issuing land certificates, thirty-five households were selected for review by the county government, the land certificates were stamped, and a small meeting of household heads was convened. At the meeting, the importance of invalidating old documents and issuing land certificates was explained, and then the certificates were issued to everyone, who voluntarily took out their old documents to exchange for land certificates. Poor peasant Liu Dechang, after receiving the land certificate, held it in both hands and said: "This year's allocated land and my house are all on this, this is my lifeline." Some also said: "Now that the land certificate has been issued, let's work hard! Living a good life is for ourselves."

The peasants who received the land certificates said: "Let's work hard! Living a good life is all for ourselves from now on."

Solution to Several Specific Problems: (1) For land and houses without documents or with lost documents where the wide-scale size is unknown, first measure the land adjacent with documents, determine the boundaries, and then measure. Write down as much as one has on the land certificate. If two adjacent plots of land have no wide-scale deeds, first measure the land adjacent to those two plots, determine the boundaries, and then those two plots will use the existing planting edges as the boundary. Whoever plants the crops harvests them, and new boundaries will be established after the autumn harvest. The above method is the old custom of the masses, and the masses agree. (2) If a contract is not presented, first measure the land adjacent to it, determine the boundaries, and then calculate how much is there, but declare: If the contract is not presented today, it will be equivalent to waste paper in the future. (3) For those who are preparing to divide the family after the autumn harvest and need each person to have their own land certificate, the problem-solving group will help to divide the land first, and after measuring and determining the boundaries, each will establish a new name and register their own. (4) Clan land issues. For clan land without graves, if ownership has been determined, the land certificate will be issued to whoever owns it. For clan land with graves but also vacant land, such land is to be obtained with the consent of the clan, determined to be collectively owned by the clan, and the clan's public name will be written on the land certificate. The right to use the land is to be reasonably distributed for cultivation after discussion and agreement by the clan. (5) Writing names issue. In order to implement anti-feudalism, women are encouraged to write their names on land certificates to break the feudal idea that "women cannot use paper and pens." Eight women in this village voluntarily requested to issue land certificates separately. Some wrote the names of the whole family on one land certificate, while others only wrote the name of the head of the household, followed by the number of men and women. (6) For lazy wives and lazy men, they only have the right to use the land. The land certificate is kept by the peasant association and will be issued after they are transformed. (7) Issues that should be paid attention to when issuing land certificates: (1) Before issuing the certificates, the significance and purpose of issuing the certificates must be explained to eliminate the masses' illusions about old documents and establish the masses' trust in the land certificates issued by the democratic government. (2) Let everyone speak and seek the consent of the individual and the family, and do not create disputes among families and masses for the sake of issuing land certificates. (3) Registration, measurement, and conversion to new standards must be carried out, but should be carried out separately depending on the circumstances, and combined with each other. Do not mechanically divide into several stages. If there are no problems, it can be written directly on the land certificate, and only those with problems will be measured, etc. (4) It is necessary to mobilize the masses to solve disputes themselves. Relying solely on the problem-solving group to solve them is not enough. (5) Issuing land certificates to women alone carries great significance in implementing the spirit of anti-feudalism and improving the economic and political status of women. However, women should not be forced to propose it, but should be educated to consciously propose it, and try to obtain the consent of the family to avoid being separated from the masses and causing family disunity. Parents should be told: This is to prevent disputes for children in the future and reduce anger.

　　确定地权发展生产
  　张刘郭庄颁发土地证
    【冀中电】深县张刘郭庄，今年头清明节就公平合理的分配了土地和浮财。错定成份而侵犯了的七户中农，今年四月里也进行了补偿工作，县委乃决定在这村颁发土地证创造经验。从八月十四日开始至九月初，已经颁发一部。现将工作过程和经验介绍如下：
  发土地证时都有些什么问题？
    开始先通过村农代会把发土地证的消息传遍全村，从酝酿中了解群众有不同的思想情况和要求：贫农、富裕中农都很欢喜，地主富农也高兴。贫农张连才说：“单凭文书官凭印，俺分了六亩地，什么执照也没有，这回要发给土地证，以后种地可就更放心了。”富裕中农张保申说：“发了土地证，种着地心里也就不敲小鼓了。”地主张根全和富农张仲勋，因为开群众大会没有叫他参加，会后便乱找干部问：“给俺发土地证吗？发了土地证，自己的东西就牢靠了。”有的中农对发土地证的态度不积极，有的说：“俺们的地才税了契，找那个麻烦干什么？”老中农张汝贤、张瑞延说：“让换就换，反正是跟潮流走吧！”有的以为要拿税契米，所以有顾虑。（按通常情况，在土改已经完成地区，政府颁发土地证，确定地权，必为各阶层所拥护，但张刘郭庄的中农却不积极，除“嫌麻烦”以外，是否还有其他原因？是否改正错订成份，补偿中农有些什么遗留的问题未获得解决，以致引起了中农不满？当地领导应注意深入检查——编者）为了统一群众对发土地证的认识，并发现具体问题，连续召开了各种会议。首先召开全村群众大会，提出：（一）确定地权，使各阶层安心生产，废除旧文书，男女要有同等的经济地位。（二）土改后人人有一份土地，土地证是一人发一份呢？还是全家发一张呢？可召开全家会议商量确定，作到全家团结和睦。（三）发土地证不要税契米。最后并号召大家还有什么土地纠纷问题，都提出来。其次召开全村妇女大会，和不同的妇女座谈会。后又在群众中召开小片会，漫谈了发土地证中的具体问题：一、没有丈量过的全要丈量。二、没有契约的地这回怎么发土地证。三、有契约的地数少了怎么办。四、这村的庄户大部分没有契约，有的因分家，尺码也不对了，怎么发。五、土地证如全家一人一张，地的好坏配搭平均不容易。所以多数的意见是把全家所有的人名字写上就行了。有的组提出，只写家长的姓名，然后写上全家男女人数。
    为了完成这个任务，特建立“发土地证委员会”，选出委员会与正副主任。又按本村土地问题中的实际情况，决定下设宣传、丈量、登记核算、处理问题等股，各股设股长一人，股员多少按着各股工作的轻重聘请。会后利用广播台将颁发土地证的组织告诉全村，并让各户准备拿契约来进行登记。
    各股工作互相结合，发动群众自己解决纠纷。开头先进行挨户登记，为了创造经验，头一天只有一个组（登记股的干部）在一个闾里进行示范登记。因事先宣传准备工作不好，所以群众有的不愿把旧契约作废，便推托不登记，结果一天只登记了十一户。当天晚上开了个全体干部会，讨论没有契约的问题，和第二天的工作怎么办。大家一致意见是尊重本村习惯“没有文契的要先尽有文契的，先尽红契地。”这样决定后，立即广播全村，让大家赶快把文书准备出来。为了集中力量搞登记，就把四个股里的干部全动员起来，分了四个小组进行。第二天工作开始后，推托说找不到文书的，觉着自己要先尽有文书的，都赶快把文书找出来了。丈量股里一开始丈量地，要求丈量的很多。有些户的地本来一点问题也没有，他也要求丈量才放心。这时丈量股便号召群众自己丈量，纠纷解决不了的户，丈量股里才丈量。有好多群众自己就把地量好了。处理问题股因为群众积有多年的问题，早先解决过的有的也翻案，所以也有好多问题处理不清。这时处理问题股就向群众说明：问题不一定非给处理问题股解决，大家可以互尽互让自己解决。后来有好多群众就自己下手解决问题了。只有群众不能解决的问题，提到处理问题股。这样经过十几天，处理问题股处理了四十个问题。丈量股也丈量了必须丈量的土地，交登记核算股进行登记和折新亩。
    因秋收已到，登记核算不能全部完成，为了示范颁发的经验，便找出了三十五户由县政府审查，把土地证盖好印，召开了一个小型的户主会，在会上讲明旧文契作废和发土地证的重要，然后就发给大家，都自愿的拿出旧文书换了土地证。贫农刘德昌领到土地证后，双手捧着说：“今年分的地和俺的房屋，都在这上哩，这就是我的命根子。”也有的说：“土地证发了，掏劲干吧！过好了日子是自己的。”
    农民拿到土地证说：“掏劲干吧！以后过好日子都是自己的。”
    几个具体问题的解决：（一）没有文书和丢掉文书而不知道阔尺的地和房子，先尽有文书的地邻量够，定出地界后再量，自己有多少就在土地证上写多少。如两家并列地全没有文契阔尺，就先尽双方有文契的地邻量够，然后这两家就以现种的地边为地界，有多少算多少，互相找补了地，庄稼谁种谁收，秋后立新界。以上的办法是群众旧有的习惯，群众都同意。（二）有文契不拿出来，就先尽地邻量够，定出地边后，有多少算多少，但是声明：有文契今天不拿出来，将来等于废纸。（三）准备秋后分家的，需要各人拿各人的土地证的，由处理问题股帮助，先把土地分开，经过丈量定出地界，就各立新名，各人登记各人的。（四）族田问题。没有坟头的族田，已经确定所有权的，是谁的就给谁发土地证，有坟头的也有空地，这样的地是征得本族同意，确定为本族公有，在土地证上写上族里的公名。土地使用权经本族讨论同意，合理分配耕种。（五）写名字问题。为了贯彻反封建，号召妇女在土地证上写名字，打破“妇女上不得纸笔”的封建思想。这村有八户妇女自动要求，单发了土地证，有的是把全家姓名写一张土地证上，有的是只写户主姓名，下写男女人数。（六）懒婆懒汉，只有土地使用权，土地证由农会保存，转变后再发给。（七）发土地证应注意的问题：（１）发证前必须讲明发证的意义和目的，肃清群众对旧文契的幻想，建立群众对民主政府所发土地证的信赖。（２）让大家说话，征求本人本家的同意，不要为发土地证而造成家庭中群众间的纠纷。（３）登记、丈量和新标准的折算都必须进行，但应分别情况，互相结合去作。不要机械的划分几个阶段。没问题的，可一直就写到土地证上，有问题的才进行丈量等。（４）必须发动群众自己解决纠纷，只靠处理问题股来解决，力量是不够的。（５）妇女单发土地证，是贯穿着反封建、提高妇女经济政治地位的精神，有很大意义。但不应强制妇女提出，而应教育妇女自觉提出，并尽量取得本家同意，免得脱离群众，使家庭闹不团结。应告诉家长：这是为儿女将来不出纠纷，少生气。
