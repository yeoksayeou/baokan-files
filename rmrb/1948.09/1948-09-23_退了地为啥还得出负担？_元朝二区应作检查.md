　　Why Do I Still Have to Pay Taxes on Land I Returned?
　　The Second District of Yuanchao Needs to Conduct an Inspection

　　During the land reform, the outer village of Ding had a lot of land that no one was farming. It was divided among me and Wu Zhongyan and six others. This land was more than four li away from the village. Because the land was far away and difficult to cultivate, it required a lot of labor, but the harvest was small (a total of one large dou of grain for the whole year). Therefore, everyone voluntarily withdrew from farming it. But they all said that I had little land. This land, nine mu, nine fen, and seven cai, was not even equivalent to two mu of standard land. Whether it yielded grain or not, even gathering firewood, so I continued to farm it. When it came time to pay the public grain, the village chief, Chen Yanhai, and the village farmers' association director, Song Maochun, said: You can't calculate that land at two fen per mu, you have to pay public grain according to the standard land. I asked that when they farmed it before, it was calculated at two fen per mu, why is it being raised to the standard now that I am farming it? He said it was raised to the standard for you. I had no choice but to pay the public grain entirely according to the standard land.

　　But the price of that land is still two fen. This means I have to use the grain from other land to pay the public grain for this piece of land. I can't afford to farm this land anymore. Therefore, in February of the lunar calendar this year, I asked the branch secretary and other village cadres to stop renting this land. The village chief and the director of the farmers' association irresponsibly said, now that democracy is being implemented, we have no right to solve this for you, you should find the masses. In February of the lunar calendar, the village cadres convened a mass meeting of the entire village. I took this opportunity to explain to the masses, so I did not farm this land this year, and to this day no one has farmed this land.

　　During the wheat harvest season this year, the director, village chief, and other cadres forced me to pay the public grain for this piece of land. I felt wronged and went to find the village cadre, Wang Wenqing. He said if you truly explained it to the masses, then we wouldn't ask you to pay. But if you said you weren't farming that piece of land during the collection, then you have to pay the public grain. I'll ask the village cadres later if you explained it. In the evening, the village cadre and the village cadre called me to the exchange. Wang Wenqing and the village branch secretary said I was undermining the Land Law Outline and used three militiamen to detain me and send me to the district office.

　　I was kept in the detention room for eleven days before they questioned me once. I explained the above situation about farming the land. Assistant Liu said you have to pay the public grain for this piece of land. If you don't pay, we'll send you to the county. I was also made to stand as punishment before the messenger sent me back home. The next morning, they sent me to the county judicial section. I explained the above situation to the judicial section. The judicial section didn't accept it and told me to go back to the district. I was detained for another two days. Assistant Liu asked me again, still forcing me to pay the public grain for this piece of land. I said I couldn't afford it, I would sell my land. Only then did he let me go home, giving me five days to pay. I asked him to give me a written explanation of the reason, but he didn't give it to me.

　　Should Assistant Liu in the district have made me stand as punishment? Should he have detained me for eleven days before questioning me once? Should the village cadres have raised the land to the standard land? I declared to the masses that I would not farm this land anymore, should I still be forced to pay the public grain for this piece of land? Please answer.

### 退了地为啥还得出负担？　元朝二区应作检查

　　退了地为啥还得出负担？
  　元朝二区应作检查
    在土改时，外村的町的土地较多没人种，分给我和吴仲言等七个人种；这地离村四里多远，因为地远难耕，下劳力较大，收获却少（全年共打粮一大斗），因此大家都自愿退出不种。但他们都说我地少，这地九亩九分七才折合不足二亩标准地，打粮食不打粮食，落把柴火，所以我就接着种了。到交纳公粮的时候，村长陈彦海，村农会主任宋茂春他们说：你种那地每亩不能算折二分了，得按标准地纳公粮。我问原先他们种时，每亩折合二分，我种怎么就提成标准了？他说就这给你提到标准地了。我没法只好完全按标准地交纳公粮。
    但那地的价格仍是二折。这样还得将其它地打的粮食，纳这块地的公粮，这地我也种不起了。所以在今年旧历二月间，向支部书记及其他村干部要求，不租这块地，村长农会主任不负责的说，现在实行民主哩，我们没有权给你解决，你找群众吧。旧历二月村干召集全村群众大会，借此机会向群众说明，所以今年就没种这块地，直至现在这块地还没人种。
    在今年麦季征收公粮的时候，主任村长等干部，却逼迫我交纳这块地的公粮。我感觉冤枉，又找坐村干部王文卿，他说如果真正向群众说明过，就不叫你拿了；如果这会征收时，你随时说不种那块地了，你得纳公粮，一会我问问村干部看你说明否？到晚上村干与坐村干部把我叫到交易所，王文卿、村支部书记说我破坏土地法大纲，用三个民兵将我拘押送到区公所里。
    一直住了十一天禁闭室，才问了我一次。我将上述种地情况述说一遍，刘助理说你得拿这块地的公粮，你不拿送你县。又罚了一回站，才叫通信员送回我去。到第二天早晨将我送到县司法科。我将上述情况对司法科述说了一遍，司法科不收，又叫我回到区里，又扣押了两天，刘助理又问了一次，仍逼着叫我拿这块地的公粮。我说我拿不起，我回家卖地吧。他才让我回家，限五日缴纳。我请他批给我一个手续说明理由，他不给我。
    区里刘助理该不该叫我罚站，该不该扣押我十一天才问我一次？村里干部该不该将地提成标准地？我向群众声明不种这块地了，该不该继叫我纳这块地的公粮？请答复一下。
