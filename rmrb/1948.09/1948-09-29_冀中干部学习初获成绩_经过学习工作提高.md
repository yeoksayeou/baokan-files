[Hebei News] The Central Hebei District Party Committee has been organizing the study of four major documents since late June: the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau's designated "Current Tasks in the Liberated Areas of North China," the CCP Central Committee's "Instructions on Land Reform and Party Consolidation Work in 1948," the Propaganda Department's "Reprint of the Preface and Text of Chapter Two of 'Left-Wing' Communism: An Infantile Disorder," and "Lenin on How Soviet Government Employees Should Work." The study lasted two months, ending around August 20. The study was better in the directly subordinate organs of the Central Hebei level, most of the directly subordinate organs of the Ninth Sub-district, and in Li County, Gaoyang, Qingyuan, Hejian City, Hejian County, Renhe, Qing County, and Shen County. Among them, the various departments of the Administrative Office (行署) gained the most, checking and improving the work of the organs according to the spirit of the documents. The inspection revealed the following problems: (1) Backlog and delay in work. For example, the Civil Affairs Department of the Administrative Office had not issued a new method of land cultivation on behalf of others from this spring to the present. The appointments of eight new county heads in the Eleventh Sub-district had not been announced for a long time after they took office. The Education Department's opinions on the education work of the refugee camps in the Tenth Sub-district could have been issued after a review, but it was delayed from May to the present. The Finance Department's grain depot had grain coupons in arrears for four or five months that could not be reimbursed. The price list of goods had not been updated for several months. The Xingde General Store of the Central Hebei Trading Company shelved its business plan without studying its implementation for a month. (2) Lack of division of labor and clear responsibilities. Generally, the work of the departments in various organs lacked scientific division of labor, resulting in uneven workloads between units and departments, and between cadres within departments, with some work unattended. For example, the various departments of the Administrative Office found that the division of labor between the Secretary's Office and the various sections was unclear. The Secretary's Office was busy all day, while some comrades in the sections had nothing to do. The Research Office of the District Party Committee was also very busy in the previous stage, often working late into the night, while those who were idle could read novels. As a result, the work was often in a passive state of response, unable to promote the strength of all cadres and organizations to solve problems in a planned and step-by-step manner, but only dealt with them individually and temporarily, reducing work efficiency. (3) Careless and perfunctory work attitude and methods. The Accounting Section of the Finance Department of the Administrative Office wrote 1.2 million catties for 120,000 catties of old inventory grain. Bo County reported 400,000 catties of grain stored as 40,000 catties, and then instructed the Eleventh Sub-district to transfer it, resulting in a serious waste of manpower and material resources. In other cases, some comrades in the Editorial Section of the Guide (导报) did not consider the consequences of revising drafts, revised them as soon as they picked up a pen, and did not review them after the revision, and did not give enough consideration to policies. A careless and perfunctory work attitude was quite common among cadres at all levels. Generally, there was a lack of strict inspection systems from superiors to subordinates. (4) Failure to observe time. This was particularly evident in meetings. Many gatherings of cadres often spent more time waiting for people than the official meeting time.

The reasons for these phenomena are primarily the lack of systems and scientific division of labor in the work, and the failure to earnestly implement inspections. Therefore, even if errors are discovered, it is difficult to investigate responsibility and correct errors, allowing the phenomena of carelessness, delay, irresponsibility, and non-implementation of resolutions in the work to develop and grow. Secondly, it is due to the individualism and liberalism in the minds of the cadres. These were also appropriately exposed and criticized in the work inspection.

After studying the documents and inspecting the work, the organs generally established systems and studied methods to improve the work. In the various departments and sections of the Administrative Office and the Secretary's Office, the various enterprise departments of Central Hebei, as well as the Public Security Bureau, the District Party Committee, and other organs, in the county party committees of Qing County, Hejian, Gaoyang, Renhe, Shen County, and other counties, as well as the governments of Shen County and Hejian, the Anguo Flag Pharmaceutical Factory, and other places, scientific division of labor was started, and various systems were established: meeting system, reporting system, and timely answers to questions from below. For example, the Gaoyang County Party Committee stipulated a work reporting system for county and district party committees, and some districts have already reported to the county party committee once every three days. And began to overcome the tendency of the district party committee not doing party affairs work in action. Most departments have made work plans and established work logs, striving to complete the work of the day on the same day. Some organs, such as the various departments of the Administrative Office, even sacrificed lunch breaks and rest to deal with past backlogs. After studying, the Anguo Flag Pharmaceutical Society improved the leadership of the organs, and the production volume of workers increased greatly. In the past, each medicine-cutting worker could cut six or seven catties of medium-quality herbs and eleven or twelve catties of coarse herbs per day. Now, they cut an average of thirteen to sixteen catties of medium-quality herbs and thirty to sixty catties of coarse herbs per day. The efficiency of counting tickets in the Ninth Sub-district Bank has increased by one-third. After this inspection and transformation movement, the work, study, and life of most organs have become more intensive and regular than in the past, the work efficiency has improved a step, and the enthusiasm of cadres has generally increased.

From the two-month study movement in Central Hebei District, the following major experiences can be drawn:

Unified Leadership of Branch and Administration

(1) The unified leadership of the branch and the administration is the first key to doing a good job in study, which is primarily determined by the serious attention and personal organization of cadre study by the administrative responsible cadres of each organ, regarding leadership of study as one of the main tasks of their own ideological leadership. Wherever the branch can unify leadership with the administration, with the head being responsible and personally organizing the leadership of cadre study, the study will definitely be sustained, and the results of the study will inevitably become practical actions to inspect and improve the work. For example, Director Luo of the Administrative Office and Director Song of the Finance Department, Director Zhang of the Agriculture and Forestry Department, and other department directors, the administrative responsible cadres of the Public Security Bureau and Central Hebei Trading Company, and the Party Committees of Li County, Hejian, Shen County, Gaoyang, and Qing County were able to personally lead the study and listen to reports. The Shen County Party Committee Secretary personally went to various departments every day to inspect the study, organize reports, and answer questions. The results of the study in these places were great. Conversely, wherever the branch and the administration cannot unify leadership, and the administration believes that study hinders work, and the responsible cadres do not participate in the study leadership, causing the branch leadership to fall into an isolated state, the study will inevitably not be done well. For example, in the early days of the Central Hebei Public Security Bureau and some county party committees, they regarded themselves as special and always thought they were busy and could be an exception, and therefore could not turn the study into a upsurge of improving work.

Leading Cadres Setting an Example

(2) Leading cadres being able to set an example and influence cadres with their own exemplary role in study is the second important condition for doing a good job in study. Especially in the initial stage of leading the actual inspection work, if leading cadres can humbly examine themselves, the development of the study movement and work inspection will inevitably be rapid and avoid detours. Because this can: First, promote the development of criticism and self-criticism; Second, provide cadres with specific methods of connecting with reality. This experience is extremely obvious in the Central Hebei Administrative Office.

Clarifying the Purpose and Method of Study

(3) In each stage of study, the leadership must clarify the main purpose of study and put forward specific requirements. In the initial stage of this study, due to the lack of clarity in the purpose and method of study by the leadership, only general indications were given to examine oneself in the spirit of the documents and carry out criticism and self-criticism, resulting in two deviations: One was the formal, mechanical, and trivial connection with reality, confined to the surface words and phrases of the documents, making the study dry and uninteresting, and unable to go deep. The other was that the problems connected were very broad: individualism, liberalism, bureaucracy, corruption, status concepts, arrogance, marriage problems, everything; the main method of study was individual reporting in groups, the problems were extremely broad, lacking a central purpose, and unable to go deep. At the joint meeting of the directly subordinate organs branch propaganda departments on July 30, the Central Hebei level emphasized that the purpose of the study was: "To improve the work of the organs, improve work efficiency, and initially establish scientific work methods and systems." For individuals, it was to overcome carelessness, perfunctory delays, lack of enthusiasm and lack of organization and discipline. The method of study was to focus on the main problems of the various departments after initially seeking unified understanding of the documents, and individual reflection should revolve around the work of the departments. At the same time, it was further emphasized that the standard for checking the quality of study should be the actual effect of work improvement. In this way, the blindness and formalism in the study leadership of some organs were overcome.

Starting from Specific Objects

(4) It is necessary to start from specific objects and classify according to cultural and political level and work experience in order to overcome generalization and formalism. In this study, the Central Hebei divided the study groups into three levels: Level A was for cadres above the county section chief level with higher cultural and political levels, focusing on self-study and supplemented by casual talks and group discussions. Level B was for general cadres at the district level, with responsible comrades giving reports on the spirit of the documents, combined with collective discussion. Level C was for service personnel, mainly attending large classes in shifts. This method is good, but in addition to studying by level, the responsible cadres of each small unit (such as section chiefs, section heads, and ministers of the Party Committee, etc.) should return to their department, section, or office at a certain time to listen to the opinions of general cadres on study and work, or conduct self-criticism in their unit, adopting a method of concentrating on studying problems in groups from time to time and discovering problems in departments, sections, and offices from time to time.

Correctly Using Study Tests

(5) The correct and timely use of study tests can play a role in encouraging and criticizing cadre study. Many cadres felt ashamed because of poor test results and then grasped the study tightly. After testing in Shen County, Hejian, Renqiu, Li County, Qingyuan, and other counties, the enthusiasm of cadres for study generally increased. When testing, the leadership must pay attention to grasping the following issues so that the test does not go astray: (1) Testing cannot become the main method of leading study. Simply emphasizing testing is prone to formalistic deviations. The most important thing is still to rely on constantly strengthening the ideological leadership and organizational leadership of study. (2) The test must be linked to reality. The questions should be based on the current policies of the Party, with concrete work and important political and current affairs common sense as the content, in order to help cadres further understand the policies of the Party and how to implement them in concrete work. Avoid asking questions that are divorced from the current reality of work, only remember nouns and numbers, or talk empty big truths, which will make cadres move towards a dogmatic method of study. (3) After the test, the results must be summarized and announced immediately, analyzing various correct and incorrect understandings and ideological problems in the test. In the evaluation, those comrades who originally had very low cultural and political levels but studied hard and made rapid progress should be given encouragement, and their efforts should not be erased. Finally, the test should be linked to the actual actions of the cadres and the results of the implementation of policies, and attention should be paid at all times to correcting and preventing the incorrect attitude of studying not for work but for testing.

　　冀中干部学习初获成绩
  　经过学习工作提高
    根据文件精神切实检查工作
  　两月来学习中的主要经验：
    【冀中讯】冀中区党委自六月下旬布置学习华北局宣传部指定之“华北解放区的当前任务”“中共中央关于一九四八年土改工作与整党工作的指示”，中宣部“重印左派幼稚病第二章前言”及本文，“列宁论苏维埃机关工作人员应如何工作”等四大文件以来，历时两月，到八月二十日左右结束。各处学习以冀中级直属机关，九分区大多数直属机关及蠡县、高阳、清苑、河间市、河间县、任河、青县、深县等较好。其中尤以行署各厅收获较好，根据文件精神检查与改善机关工作。在检查中发现了以下的问题：（一）工作上的积压与拖延，如行署民政厅对一个新的代耕办法，从今春延至现在还未发出。十一分区八个新县长就职很久，未通令加委。教育厅对十分区难民收容所的教育工作意见，本来审查一下就可以发出。但却从五月拖延到现在。财厅粮库积压粮票四五个月没法报销。实物价目数月不加清理。冀中贸易公司的兴德总店将业务计划搁置起来，不研究执行，直压了一个月。（二）缺乏分工与明确职责。一般机关部门的工作都缺乏科学分工，致使各单位与部门之间，部门中干部之间忙闲不一，某些工作则无人管理。如行署各厅都检查出秘书室与各科分工不清，秘书室成天很忙，而某些科内同志无事可作。区党委研究室前一阶段也是忙的经常开夜车，闲的可以看小说，因此，影响工作经常处于被动应付状态，不能推动全体干部与各个组织力量，有计划有步骤的解决问题，而只是零星琐碎的去个别处理，和临时应付，降低了工作效率。（三）粗枝大叶潦草的工作态度与方法。行署财政厅会计科把旧库存粮十二万斤写成一百二十万斤。博野县存粮四万斤，报告为四十万斤，后指示十一分区去调运，结果严重浪费了人力物力。其他如导报编辑科有些同志改稿不考虑，提笔就改，改后也不审查，对政策慎重考虑不够。潦草与粗枝大叶的工作态度在各级干部中相当普遍存在。上对下一般都缺乏严格的检查制度。（四）不遵守时间。这特别表现在开会上。干部中好多集会往往等人的时间比正式会议的时间还要长。
    这些现象产生的原因首先主要是由于工作上缺乏制度与科学分工，不能认真执行检查，因而即使发现错误亦难追究责任，纠正错误，使工作中的潦草、拖延、不负责任、不执行决议等现象得以发展滋长。其次，是由于干部中的个人主义与自由主义思想。这些，在工作检查中也作了适当的揭露与批评。
    经过文件学习和工作检查以后，各机关都较普遍的建立了制度，研究了改进工作的方法。在行署各厅各科与秘书室、冀中各企业部门，以及公安局、区党委等机关，在青县、河间、高阳、任河、深县等县委机关，以及深县、河间政府、安国旗帜药厂等处，都着手进行科学分工，规定了各种制度：会议制度，汇报制度，并及时答复下面的问题。如高阳县委规定了县区委工作汇报制度，有的区已做到三天向县委报告一次。并开始从行动上克服区委不作党务工作的偏向。多数部门都作了工作计划，建立了工作日志，争取当天工作当天完成。有的机关，如行署各厅为处理过去积压工作，甚至牺牲了午睡和休息。安国旗帜药社学习后改善了机关领导，工人生产量大增。过去每个切药工人每天切中货六、七斤，粗货十一、二斤，现在中货每天平均切十三斤到十六斤，粗货卅多斤到六十多斤。九分区银行点票效率提高了三分之一。经过这一个检查与改造运动之后，大多数机关的工作、学习、生活都比过去紧张正规了，工作效率提高了一步，干部积极性普遍增长。
    从冀中区两个月来的学习运动中，可以得出以下几点主要的经验：
    支部行政统一领导
    （一）支部与行政领导的统一是学习搞好的第一个关键，而这又首先决定于各机关行政负责干部认真重视与亲自组织干部学习，把领导学习看作自己思想领导的主要工作之一。凡是支部能与行政上统一领导，由首长负责，亲自动手组织领导干部学习的，学习就一定能坚持，学习的结果必然成为检查与改进工作的实际行动。如行署罗主任及财政厅宋厅长、农林厅张厅长等各厅厅长，公安局、冀中贸易公司的行政负责干部和蠡县、河间、深县、高阳、青县的党委，都能亲身领导学习，听取汇报。深县县委书记每天还亲自到各部门去检查学习，组织报告，和解答问题。这些地方的学习成绩就大。反之，凡是支部与行政不能统一领导，行政上认为学习妨碍工作，负责干部又不参加学习领导，使支部领导陷于孤立状态，则学习必然搞不好，如冀中公安局初期，及某些县委自视特殊，总以为自己忙，可以例外，因而便不能把学习造成为改进工作的热潮。
    领导干部以身作则
    （二）领导干部能以身作则，以自己的学习模范作用影响干部，是搞好学习的第二个重要条件，尤其在领导实际检查工作的初期，领导干部如能虚心检讨自己，学习运动和工作检查的开展必然很快，而且少走弯路。因为，这样可以：第一、推动开展批评与自我批评；第二、提供干部联系实际的具体方法，这个经验在冀中行署极为明显。
    明确学习目的方法
    （三）在各个学习阶段，领导必须明确学习的主要目的，提出具体要求。这次学习的初期，由于领导上对学习目的方法不够明确，只是一般的指出以文件精神检讨自己，开展批评与自我批评，因而发生两种偏向：一个是形式的机械而琐碎的联系实际，拘限于文件的表面字句，使学习干燥无味，不能深入。另一个是联系问题非常广泛：个人主义、自由主义、官僚主义、贪污腐化、地位观念、自高自大、婚姻问题应有尽有；学习方法主要是个人在小组报告，问题极广，缺乏中心目的，不能深入。冀中级在七月三十日直属机关支宣联席会上就强调提出学习目的是：“改进机关工作，提高工作效能，初步建立科学的工作方法与制度。”对个人则是克服粗枝大叶，潦草拖延，不积极不热情及无组织无纪律状态。学习方法是在初步求得文件统一认识之后，以检查各部门的主要问题为主，个人反省则应围绕部门工作。同时更强调检查学习的好坏应以工作改进的实际效果为标准。这样，才克服了某些机关学习领导上的盲目性与形式主义。
    从具体对象出发
    （四）必须从具体对象出发，按文化政治水平和工作经验分级，才能克服一般化与形式主义。冀中在这次学习小组共分三级，甲级是文化政治水平较高的县科长以上干部，以自学阅读为主，辅以漫谈和小组讨论。乙级为区级一般干部，由负责同志作关于文件精神的报告，结合集体讨论。丙级为勤杂人员，主要是分班上大课。这种方法是好的，但除按级学习外，各小单位负责干部（如科长、股长、党委的部长等），在一定时间应回到本部门、科、室，听取一般干部对学习和工作的竟见，或在本单位进行检讨，采取时而按组集中研究问题，时而到部、科、室发现问题的方法。
    正确利用学习测验
    （五）正确的适时的利用学习测验，对干部学习可起鼓励与批评的作用，好些干部因测验成绩不好，觉着丢人，以后就抓紧学习了。在深县、河间、任邱、蠡县、清苑等县经测验之后，干部学习情绪普遍提高。在测验时领导上必须注意掌握以下问题，不使测验走了偏向：（一）测验不能成为领导学习的主要方法，单纯的强调测验，就易犯形式主义的偏向。最重要的仍赖于经常加强学习的思想领导与组织领导。（二）测验必须与实际联系，出题要根据当前党的各种方针政策，以具体工作与重要的政治时事常识为内容，以帮助干部进一步了解党的政策与在具体工作中如何贯彻。切忌出些脱离当前工作实际，光记名词数字或空讲大道理的题目，那会使干部走向教条主义的学习方法。（三）测验之后，必须即时总结宣布成绩，分析测验中各种正确与不正确认识与思想问题。评判中对原来文化政治水平很低，但学习努力，进步很快的同志，要给他们以鼓励，不要抹煞了他们的努力。最后要把测验与干部的实际行动以及执行政策的结果联系起来，时时注意纠正与防止不是为工作乃是为测验而学习的不正确态度。
