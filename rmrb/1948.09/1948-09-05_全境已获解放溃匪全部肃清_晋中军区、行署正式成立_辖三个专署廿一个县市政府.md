　　【Jinzhong Telegram】Under the victorious offensive of our army, the Jinzhong area, except for the isolated city of Taiyuan, has been completely liberated. The Jinzhong Military Region and the Administrative Office were officially established on August 15th. Comrade Luo Guibo serves as the Commander and Political Commissar of the Military Region, and Comrades Niu Yinguan and Shi Huaibi serve as the Director and Deputy Director of the Administrative Office, respectively. The entire region administers three special districts and twenty-one democratic county and city governments. The first special district has seven counties: Wutai, Dingxiang, Mengxian, Xinxian, Yangqu, Pingding, and Chouyang. The second special district has seven counties: Xugou, Qingyuan, Jinyuan (formerly Taiyuan County), Jiaocheng, Wenshui, Fenyang, and Xiaoyi. The third special district has six counties and one city: Yuci, Taigu, Qixian, Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, and Pingyao City. Currently, democratic regimes have been established in all newly recovered counties. All remnants of bandits within the territory have been eliminated, and order is very good. Jinzhong was originally the most prosperous region in Shanxi, with fertile land and convenient transportation. Unfortunately, under the tyrannical rule of Yan's bandit army-peasant unity policy, fields were left barren, and the people lived in misery. Now, our democratic government is vigorously eliminating wasteland, restoring production, and actively preparing for the autumn harvest and wheat planting, in order to overcome the serious disaster caused to the people by the Jiang-Yan bandits.
    【Additional News】The Jinzhong Branch of the Xinhua News Agency was officially established on August 25th and has already begun sending稿 (gao - articles) to the main branch.

　　全境已获解放溃匪全部肃清
  　晋中军区、行署正式成立
  　辖三个专署廿一个县市政府
    【晋中电】在我军胜利进攻下，晋中地区除太原孤城外，已全部解放。晋中军区与行政公署，已于八月十五日正式成立。罗贵波同志任军区司令员兼政治委员，牛荫冠、史怀必二同志任行署正副主任。全区辖三个专署，二十一个民主县市政府。一专署七个县：五台、定襄、盂县、忻县、阳曲、平定、筹阳。二专署七个县：徐沟、清源、晋源（原太原县）、交城、文水、汾阳、孝义。三专署六个县一个市：榆次、太谷、祁县、平遥、介休、灵石、平遥市。现新收复区各县民主政权，已经建立。境内溃匪全部肃清，秩序甚为良好。晋中原为山西最富庶的地区，土地肥沃，交通方便。惜在阎匪兵农合一暴政下，弄得田园荒芜，民不聊生。现我民主政府，正以大力消灭荒地，恢复生产，积极准备秋收种麦，借以渡过蒋阎匪给人民所造成的严重灾荒。
