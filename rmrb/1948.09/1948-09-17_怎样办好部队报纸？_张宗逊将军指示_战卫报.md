Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th. Northwest People's Liberation Army Deputy Commander General Zhang Zongxun is concerned about military newspapers. He recently wrote to a certain unit's "Zhan Wei Bao" (Combat Guard Newspaper) to instruct them on how to run a good military newspaper. In his letter, he pointed out: "The newspaper is a leadership tool, not a literacy textbook. Leaders who pay attention to mass work often value the role of newspapers, using newspapers to unite, educate, and organize the masses to complete the current political tasks." "A good and reputable newspaper is one that is connected with the masses and concerned by the masses," and "it will play a great leading role in completing certain political tasks." "Newspaper workers who do not have this basic idea often regard the newspaper as purely 'cultural' work, and their cultural work in their minds is for the sake of cultural work." Deputy Commander Zhang believes that the content of military tabloids "should mainly educate the masses with the deeds of the masses," followed by the calls of the leading organs and leaders, materials from neighboring units, and current affairs news. "When writing about the deeds of the masses, it is not the editor's fabrication, or out of interest, nor is it a record of everything heard among the masses; but to find typical examples among the masses." It is necessary to be good at praising, promoting, and improving typical examples that are active and creative, so that the masses can learn; it is also necessary to be good at exposing backward and failed typical examples, so that the masses pay attention to overcoming and being vigilant. "When writing calls, be concise, to the point, and easy to understand, and avoid the style of writing editorials in large newspapers. When writing materials from neighboring units, it should be limited to outstanding typical examples. When publishing news, it should also be limited to particularly important victory news. In short, the material should be suitable for the nature of the tabloid and suitable for the reading of the target audience." He also pointed out that in the newspaper's recent four issues, each issue had a long article, occupying one-half or two-thirds of the newspaper's space; the material was divorced from the soldiers, who are the newspaper's basic audience. In the four issues, there was only one article reflecting the soldiers of the company, and the rest were articles reflecting cadres and office staff. The newspaper does not see contributions from soldiers and junior-level cadres.

　　怎样办好部队报纸？
    张宗逊将军指示“战卫报”
    【新华社西北十三日电】西北人民解放军副司令员张宗逊将军，关心部队报纸，最近特写信给某部“战卫报”指示如何办好部队报纸，他在信里指出：“报纸是领导工具，不是识字课本。注重群众性工作的领导者，常是重视报纸的作用，利用报纸团结群众、教育群众、组织群众去完成当前的政治任务。”“一个好的有威信的报纸，是与群众有联系，为群众所关心的”，“在完成一定的政治任务中是会起很大的领导作用”。“没有具备这种基本思想的报纸工作者，往往把报纸看作单纯的‘文化’工作，他们思想上的文化工作又是为文化而作文化工作。”张副司令认为部队小报内容，“主要的应以群众的事迹来教育群众”，其次才是领导机关与首长的号召，友邻部队的材料及时事新闻等。“在写群众事迹时，不是编者的臆造，或出自兴趣，也不是在群众中有闻必录；而是在群众中找出典型”。要善于表扬、推广与提高有积极性、创造性的典型，使群众学习；也要善于揭发落后与失败的典型，使群众注意克服与警惕。“写号召时，要简明、扼要、通俗，切忌办大报写社论的作风。在写友邻材料时，应限于特出的典型。在登载新闻时，也仅限于特别重大的胜利消息。总之，取材要适合于小报性质，适合于对象阅读”。他并指出该报最近四期，每期都有一篇大文章，占去报纸二分之一或三分之二的篇幅；取材脱离战士群众，而战士才是这种报纸的基本群众。四期中，仅有一篇反映连队战士的稿件，其余都是反映干部和机关工作人员的稿件。报纸中看不到战士和初下级干部的投稿。
