　　To Cultivate Thousands of Revolutionary Construction Talents
  　North China University Officially Established
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China University Founding Ceremony was solemnly held on August 24th. In addition to the more than 2,000 faculty members and students of the school, guests included Comrades Xie Juezai, Lan Gongwu, Chen Jinkun, Qiao Mu, Zhou Yang, Xiao San, Huang Mo, and Tian Jian, as well as Mr. Li Junfu, director of the Chemistry Department of Henan University who had arrived from afar, along with a group of six people, the Shijiazhuang City Primary and Secondary School Teachers Association, students from city middle schools, the Shijiazhuang City Youth Committee, and visiting groups from the Daxing Yarn Factory. When Chairman Qian Junrui, the Academic Affairs Director, announced the opening of the meeting, he said: "The thriving atmosphere of this conference symbolizes the victory of the revolutionary education cause under the victory of the people's revolutionary war." President Wu Yuzhang called on everyone to study Mao Zedong Thought diligently and explained the basic content of Mao Zedong Thought. He announced the school's policy, which is to absorb a large number of educated youth and train them through basic political education to become thousands of construction cadres for all aspects of the liberated areas. The entire school is divided into four departments: the first department is a short-term political training class; the second department is to train and improve the teachers of secondary schools; the third department is to train and improve the cadres of people's literature and art; the fourth department is a research department, including advanced research groups for various specialized subjects, to cultivate teachers for universities. Finally, Wu Lao encouraged everyone with the four words "loyalty, trustworthiness, faith, and sincerity." Amid cheerful music, students from each department presented gifts and paid respects to their alma mater. Comrade Xie Juezai called on everyone to combine study with practice and establish a revolutionary outlook on life that serves the people. Mr. Lan Gongwu proposed that North China University should undertake the task of "transforming knowledge and transforming thought – that is, the ideological revolution and the knowledge revolution." Comrade Zhou Yang pointed out in his speech: "North China University is a university for studying politics, a university for studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Politics must be studied as a science, and at the same time, politics must become the flesh and blood of life. If a person does not strive to understand the actual situation among the masses, is unwilling or unable to observe problems and study problems from the interests of the masses, he will never understand politics." The famous jurist Mr. Chen Jinkun pointed out: The contrast between universities in the liberated areas and universities in the KMT-controlled areas is like comparing heaven and hell, so he called on everyone to consciously complete their study tasks. Mr. Li Junfu, director of the Chemistry Department of Henan University, talked about his impressions of the liberated areas, and said with great emotion: "Just as the Chiang bandits were indiscriminately bombing innocent people in Kaifeng, seventy-nine of us escaped from Kaifeng to contact the People's Liberation Army. They vacated the trucks that were transporting artillery and ammunition and said: 'We would rather not have the artillery than send you to a safe area.'" Finally, he talked about his feelings about participating in the ceremony and said: "The students here are living a free and happy life; but the students in the KMT-controlled areas are suffering persecution and hunger. They are expecting you to liberate them. I hope that all the people in the liberated areas should shoulder the responsibility of liberating the compatriots who are still suffering in the KMT-controlled areas!" Comrade Ai Siqi spoke on behalf of the faculty and staff, and put forward two points, "unity" and "study," to encourage everyone. Finally, student representative Yang Li resolutely stated on behalf of all the students: We will unite closely under the banner of Mao Zedong and study hard, and complete our tasks under the leadership of the North China Bureau and the North China Government, and Presidents Wu, Fan, and Cheng, and all the leaders. At the conference, President Cheng awarded graduation certificates to the first and second classes of the first department and the second, third, fourth, and fifth classes of the former Peking University College of Arts and Education. The entire conference lasted for four days. At the same time as the conference, a North China University founding exhibition, ball games, dramas, music, film evenings, and other events were held, featuring programs such as "March of Democratic Youth" and "Chiye River." Finally, the conference passed a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De to pay tribute.

    【本报讯】华北大学成立典礼大会已于八月廿四日隆重举行。到会者除该校全体教职学员二千余人外，来宾有谢觉哉、蓝公武、陈瑾琨、乔木、周扬、萧三、荒煤、田间等同志，新从远道而来的河南大学化学系主任李俊甫等一行六人及石家庄市中小学教联会，市中同学、石市青委会，大兴纱厂等参观团等。主席钱俊瑞教务长宣布开会时说：“大会这种兴旺气象，象征着在人民革命战争的胜利之下革命教育事业的胜利。”吴玉章校长号召大家努力学习毛泽东思想，并阐明毛泽东思想的基本内容。他宣布了学校的方针，是吸收大量的知识青年，经过基本的政治教育培养成千成万的为解放区各方面的建设干部。全校分设四部，第一部是短期政治训练班性质；第二部是训练和提高中等学校的师资；第三部是训练和提高人民文艺的干部；第四部为研究部，包括各项专门学问的高级研究组，培养大学校的师资。吴老最后以“忠诚信笃”四字勖勉大家，在欢快的乐声中，各部同学向母校献礼致敬。谢觉哉同志号召大家学习要与实际结合，建立为人民服务的革命人生观。蓝公武先生提出今后华北大学应负起“改造学问、改造思想——也就是思想革命学问革命的任务。”周扬同志讲话指出：“华北大学是个学政治的大学，是学习马列主义毛泽东思想的大学。政治必须当作科学来学习，同时政治必须成为生活的血肉。一个人如果不努力去了解群众中的实际情况，不愿意或不善于从群众的利益去观察问题，研究问题，他是永远不会懂得政治的。”名法学家陈瑾琨先生指出：在解放区大学里和蒋管区大学对比，恰是一个天堂，一个地狱，因此他号召大家完全自觉的完成自己的学习任务。河大化学系主任李俊甫先生谈到对解放区的观感，很感动的说：“正当蒋匪在开封滥施轰炸无辜人民的时候，我们七十九个人从开封逃出来向解放军接洽，他们就把正在运送大炮军火的汽车誊了出来说：‘我们宁可不要大炮，也要把你们送到安全地区。’”最后他谈到参加典礼的感想说：“同学们在这里正过着自由幸福的生活；可是蒋管区学生正遭受迫害饥饿，他们正期望着你们去解放他们，我希望全解放区的人们应该担负起解放还在蒋管区受苦难的同胞的责任！”艾思奇同志代表教职员讲话，提出“团结”“学习”二点勉励大家。最后学员代表杨犁代表全体同学坚决表示：紧密的团结在毛泽东旗帜下努力学习，在华北局与华北政府，在吴、范、成三校长和各首长的领导下完成我们的任务。大会并由成校长颁发第一部第一、二班及前北大文教学院二、三、四、五班毕业证书。大会全程历时四天，与大会同时，连日并举行华大成立展览会、球赛、戏剧、音乐、电影晚会等，演出“民主青年进行曲”，“赤叶河”等节目。大会最后通过向毛主席、朱德司令去电致敬。
