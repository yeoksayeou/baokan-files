【Jinan News】Handan City cadres, during their July study sessions, with the exception of a portion of state-owned store cadres, implemented and adhered to the study plan and system. They also conducted ideological self-reflection and work reviews based on the Four Great Documents, discovering widespread and significant problems in the thinking and work of cadres.

　　(1) Lack of organization and discipline. Many comrades violated organizational principles without realizing it, and did not recognize their mistakes when they made them. Some comrades knew it was wrong and deliberately did it. Regarding the implementation of resolutions, some said they would execute them in action, but disagreed in their minds. (If one disagrees with a superior's resolution, one can reserve their opinion, but must declare it to the superior. Before the superior changes the resolution, it must still be resolutely implemented. - Editor). For example, Section Chief × of the government's judicial section reflected on himself, belittling the higher-level organization, thinking that it would not be good if the city were placed under the leadership of the prefectural committee. ×× of the middle school only saw the shortcomings of the head of teaching, but not the merits, thus generating thoughts of disbelief and disrespect. They considered this to be a relationship between individuals, and did not recognize it as a relationship between the individual and the organization. (2) Unclear responsibilities, unclear division of labor, and lack of efficiency in work. This problem also existed within the municipal party committee itself. Until studying the documents, the relationship between the municipal party committee and the government was not well resolved. Problems could not be solved in a timely manner, and thorough inspections could not be carried out in a timely manner. (3) After party rectification, cadres were afraid of making mistakes and did not dare to move forward, believing that the more work they did, the more mistakes they would make, and that it was better to do less than more. This was especially true for some comrades from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds. For example, a cadre reflected that after party rectification, his own background was not good, and others looked down on him and he could not get along. He was suspicious and did not feel at ease in his work, holding a "monk-like" attitude. (4) Some comrades who had been punished were constantly planning for their punishment after the correction of errors, making noise everywhere, complaining about the leadership, and even some individuals used their punishment as an excuse to resist work, demanding that they would not work unless the punishment was revised. Some said: The conclusion made by the leadership on me is unreasonable, so I cannot work and study with peace of mind. (5) Some cadres with family difficulties requested solutions to personal debts and children's issues. Because these problems were not easy to solve, they affected their emotions, and they were unwilling to study or even work. (6) There was a general lack of dedication and responsibility in work, especially in schools. Many teachers adopted a perfunctory attitude toward teaching, preparing lessons without preparation or research, and casually compiling teaching materials. In managing students, they often proceeded from likes and dislikes, and did not patiently educate and transform them. They did not try to overcome difficulties, and lacked a spirit of innovation.

　　In studying the documents, due to a preliminary understanding of the basic spirit of the documents, reflecting on thoughts, and reviewing work, there were significant changes and improvements in the thinking and work of cadres. (1) Consciously exposed ideological problems, criticized erroneous thoughts, and improved ideological awareness and revolutionary responsibility, and enhanced the cadres' political enthusiasm. For example, ××× in the middle school developed a fear of death due to illness, was spiritually decadent, and did not want to do anything. He wanted to be a messenger, eating when he could eat and playing when he could play. He held the erroneous attitude of living one day less than three meals. After studying, he realized that this kind of thinking was wrong, and clarified that decadent thoughts are all political degeneration. ××× used to be unwilling to do teaching work, feeling that it was meaningless and had no future, and asked to do mass work. After studying, he settled down in his work. Some primary school teachers were previously dissatisfied with education work, believing that it had no status or future. Some suggested that their abilities were small and they would not be able to do it for long, so it was better to quit early and do business. After studying, their emotions generally stabilized. (2) Inspected and criticized the undisciplined and anarchic thinking of the staff of the organs, resolved the cadre disputes that occurred as a result, established or are establishing new systems, and clarified the responsibilities and authority of each person. At the city-wide cadre meeting, the municipal party committee put forward preliminary opinions on establishing systems in the future. Each unit, based on the general spirit, is researching and formulating various systems suitable to their situation. For example, the Industry and Commerce Bureau previously had chaotic work relationships that affected the unity of cadres. After studying, they divided labor and clarified authority. The municipal party committee organs formulated a new living system, and the administrative staff and odd-job personnel all carried out clear and specific divisions of labor, and delineated the scope of work. (3) Improved the relationship between superiors and subordinates and between cadres. (4) Eliminated the ideological concerns of cadres who had been "cleansed" and returned, and old intellectuals, and stabilized their working emotions. For example, ×××, who was sent to a middle school as a teacher after being struggled against, is willing to serve the people wholeheartedly after studying, and has recently become more active in his work. ×× said: "The government has opened up a path for me, and I am very willing to serve the people." He was unwilling to approach people when he first came, and dared not speak at meetings. After studying, he became bolder in speaking and also approached people. (What kind of cadres were cleansed, why were they cleansed, should they have been cleansed, and why were they cleansed and then returned? ×× was unwilling to approach people and dared not speak at meetings. In addition to his ideological concerns, are there any shortcomings in leadership methods and work style? The above questions are worth further reflection. - Editor)

　　The reasons for achieving these results in a month of study are mainly the following: (1) In-depth and repeated mobilization to break down ideological obstacles in learning. For example, the Municipal Party Committee convened a cadre meeting to conduct unified ideological mobilization and arrange study, and specifically pointed out the key points and purposes of the study. Then, each unit conducted deliberations in light of the actual situation of the department and formulated specific plans. For example, the Cultural and Education Department Study Branch emphasized that the importance of learning is to unify thoughts and organizations, concentrate efforts to strengthen combat effectiveness, and improve work efficiency. At the same time, it pointed out the bad phenomena of overcoming the separation of learning and work in the past, slack leadership, letting things go, and engaging in formalities without connecting with reality. (2) Starting from reality, different learning focuses and requirements are proposed for different objects. For example, the municipal government proposed that the section chief group focus on checking organizational concepts and the accuracy, creativity, and bureaucratic style in their work. (3) The leadership sets an example and constantly discovers problems and corrects deviations in a timely manner. The cadres of the Industry and Commerce Bureau were initially not in high spirits. After inspection, it was found that the staff's thinking was mainly that they were afraid that the section chief would not inspect them if they did not feel they had a right to offer opinions. Later, the leaders made an inspection, and the staff felt that the problem could be solved, which improved the staff's enthusiasm for learning and the courage to offer opinions. Although there are the above achievements, there are still many shortcomings and deviations. Individual units have not started learning at all. Five of the six cadres in a state-owned store are still in a bad mood. Some units only checked some phenomena in their work and have not yet traced the root causes of their thinking. Comrades with low cultural levels tend to engage in terminology (for comrades with low cultural levels, a more teaching-based approach should be adopted to explain difficult terminology. - Editor). Some cadres still have ideological concerns and dare not boldly reflect on themselves and criticize others. The leadership still lacks regular and timely inspection, timely discovery of problems and solutions to problems, and exchange of experiences. These shortcomings and deviations need to be overcome and continuously improved in future studies.

　　邯市干部坚持学习制度
  　批判错误思想克服无政府现象提高工作
    【冀南讯】邯郸市干部在七月份的学习中，除一部分公营商店干部外，各机关部门都执行与坚持了学习计划和学习制度，并根据四大文件进行了思想反省和工作检讨，发现了干部思想和工作上存在着普遍而繁重的问题。
    （一）缺乏组织性和纪律性。许多同志违犯了组织原则自己不觉悟，犯了错误不认识错误。有些同志知道是错误故意去犯。在执行决议上有人说行动上执行，思想上不同意（对上级决议，思想上不同意，可以保留，但必须向上级声明，在上级改变该决议之前，仍须坚决执行。——编者）。如政府司法科×科长反省自己，轻视上级组织，认为该市划给地委领导不会好。中学××对教导主任只看到毛病而不看忧点，因而产生不相信不尊重的思想。对此错误思想，还认为是人与人的关系，不承认是个人与组织的关系。（二）职权不清，分工不明，工作缺乏效率。这个问题在市委本身也存在，直到学习文件市委与政府的关系未很好解决，工作上不能及时解决问题，不能及时深入检查。（三）整党后怕犯错误不敢前进，认为作的工作多犯的错误多，多一事不如少一事。特别是一些地富出身的同志更甚。如某干部自己反省认为整党后自己成份不好别人看不起吃不开，怀疑多，不安心工作、抱着“当和尚”的态度。（四）一些受处分的同志在纠偏之后天天为处分作打算，到处乱吵吵，埋怨领导，甚至个别同志拿受处分作为抵当工作的借口，提出不修改处分就不工作。有的说：领导上对我作的结论不通，因此不能安心工作和学习。（五）个别家庭有困难的干部，要求解决个人的债务和小孩等问题，这些问题因为不易解决，就影响了情绪，不愿学习甚至不作工作。（六）工作上普遍缺乏事业性和责任心，在学校中尤其严重。许多教员在教学问题上抱应付态度，上课无准备不研究，随随便便编教材。在管理学生上多从好恶出发，不耐心教育改造。有了困难不设法克服，无创造精神。
    在学习文件中，由于初步领会了文件的基本精神，反省了思想，检查了工作，所以在干部思想及工作上都有显著的转变与改进。（一）自觉的暴露了思想问题，批判了错误思想，提高了思想觉悟与革命的责任心，提高了干部的政治情绪。如中学×××有病产生怕死思想，精神颓废啥也不想干，想当通讯员，得吃就吃得玩就玩。抱着过一天少三晌的错误态度。学习之后认识到这种思想是错误的，并明确了颓废思想都是政治上蜕化。×××过去不愿作教导工作，觉得没意思没前途，要求作群众工作。学习后工作安下心来。一些小学教员过去对教育工作不满，认为没地位没前途。有的提出自己能力小干不长，不如早些不干做买卖去。学习后一般的都安定了情绪。（二）检查批判了机关人员无纪律无政府状态的思想，解决了因此发生的干部纠纷问题，建立了或正在建立新的制度，明确了每个人的职责权限。市委在全市干部会议上提出今后建立制度的初步意见，各单位根据总的精神正在研究制订适合情况的各种制度。如工商局过去因工作关系混乱影响了干部团结，学习后进行了分工，明确了权限。市委机关制订了新的生活制度，事务勤杂人员都进行明确具体的分工，划定了工作范围。（三）改善了上下级之间与干部互相间的关系。（四）解除了曾经“清洗”又回来的干部与旧知识分子的思想顾虑，安定了他们的工作情绪。如被斗后到中学当教员的×××，学习后愿忠心为人民服务，最近工作也积极起来了。××说：“政府给自己开辟了一条道路，自己很愿为人民服务”。他刚来时不愿接近人，开会不敢发言，学习后说话也大胆了，也接近人了。（被清洗的是什么干部，为什么被清洗，该不该清洗，为什么被清洗了又回来。××不愿接近人，开会不敢发言，除他思想上有所顾虑外，在领导方法与作风上是否还有缺点。以上问题值得深入检讨。——编者）
    在一个月的学习中，能获得这些成绩的原因，主要有以下几点：（一）深入的反复动员，打破学习中的思想障碍。如市委召开干部大会，进行统一的思想动员与布置学习，并具体指出学习的重点与目的。然后各单位又结合部门实际情况进行酝酿，制定具体计划。如文教部门学习分会，强调说明学习的重要是为了思想统一与组织统一集中力量加强战斗力，提高工作效率。同时指出克服过去学习与工作分家，领导松懈自流抓不紧，和光搞名词不联系实际的不良现象。（二）从实际出发，对不同对象提出不同的学习重点和要求。如市政府在科长组提出着重检查组织观念与工作中的精确性、创造性，与官僚主义作风等问题。（三）领导上以身作则，并经常发现问题及时纠正偏向。工商局的干部开始情绪不高，经检查后发现科员的思想主要是见科长不检查怕自己提意见不顶事。后来领导上作了检查，科员都认为能解决问题，提高了科员的学习情绪和提意见的勇气。虽有以上成绩，但还存在许多缺点和偏向。个别单位学习根本没搞起来，某公营商店六个干部还有五个在闹情绪。有的单位只检查了工作中的一些现象，还没有追清思想根源。文化水平低的同志偏重搞名词（对文化水平低的同志，应多采取讲授方式，解释难懂名词。——编者）。有些干部思想上还有所顾虑，不敢大胆反省自己批评别人。领导上还缺乏经常及时的检查，及时发觉问题解决问题，交流经验。这些缺点与偏向，在今后学习中需要努力克服，继续改进。
