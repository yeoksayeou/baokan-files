Beiyue Administrative Office Issues Detailed Instructions
	Organize Labor to Complete the Three Autumn Harvests

【Beiyue Electric】The Beiyue Administrative Office issued instructions on August 31 regarding autumn harvesting, wheat planting, and autumn plowing. The original text is as follows:
	(1) Autumn Harvesting: Autumn harvesting work should propose different tasks for different regions. To consolidate, the first priority is timely harvesting, reaping as soon as crops are ripe, to avoid losses from windstorms and autumn rains. In border areas and guerrilla zones, labor must be combined with military preparedness, remaining vigilant against enemy plots to seize grain. Local military units, work teams, and militias should proactively launch attacks to protect the autumn harvest. Party and government leading organs must seize the initiative to organize peasants to rush harvesting, rush reaping, quick threshing, and quick storage, and strengthen anti-smuggling efforts to prevent the enemy from forcibly requisitioning, buying, or stealing a single grain of food.
	Regardless of whether it is a consolidated area or a guerrilla zone, selecting seeds in the field should be an important task for this year's autumn harvest. In recent years, crop varieties have been mixed and of poor quality, and diseases are very serious. In many places, millet production has decreased by as much as 15% due to "exposed cores" or "old-looking grains." Corn, sorghum, and millet have experienced yield reductions of 10% to 20% due to head smut. Field selection of seeds is one of the basic methods to reduce crop infectious diseases and achieve increased grain production. All localities must conscientiously study and widely publicize the seed selection methods published in the Chahar Daily on August 27, and specifically convene symposiums of industry assistant, industry committee members, and experienced farmers to arrange, implement, supervise, and inspect, make concrete achievements, lay the foundation for seed selection, and gradually change the backward habits of farmers not selecting seeds or selecting them in the field. The selected seeds should be dried and placed in a dry, cool place, not hung under the eaves to avoid wind, rain, sun, and smoke.
		Organize Field Seed Selection 	Prepare Sufficient Fertilizer
	To protect the fruits of the peasants' labor for the year, all localities should establish field watching organizations, formulate autumn protection covenants, and strictly prevent sabotage by thieves and vandals. Special attention should be paid to Chahar South and Yanbei.
	(2) Wheat Planting: This year's abundant rain is good for wheat planting. Wheat should be planted as much as possible in suitable watered land and good dry land. However, wheat should not be forced to be planted in bad land that is not suitable for wheat planting or where wheat yields will be reduced due to thin soil, or in dry land where sowing cannot be done in a timely manner after summer drought. This year's focus for guiding wheat planting is:
	First, vigorously solve the fertilizer problem: The lack of fertilizer for wheat planting last year is an important reason for the reduced wheat yield this year. When planting wheat this autumn, it is required to apply more base fertilizer and fully fertilize. All kinds of fertilizer that can be delivered to the field should be used for wheat fields first. (Fertilizer for next spring sowing can be quickly prepared during the slack season by continuing to accumulate fertilizer, build reservoirs, and release silt to prepare early.) If it is still insufficient, it should be advocated to use black beans, hemp seeds, and other supplements. Attention should be paid to helping the military, workers, families of martyrs, and poor households solve their fertilizer shortage difficulties through mutual aid and agricultural loans. Poor farmers who really need and are willing to apply base fertilizer but lack fertilizer for planting wheat can be given special fertilizer loans.
	Second, in order to effectively prevent bunt disease, this year efforts should be made to promote the warm water soaking method of "two openings and one cooling" or the method of mixing one jin of seeds with seven qian of Chinese dates wine (grain wine can be slightly less), as well as methods of using fine sieves, salt water, muddy water, and windmills to eliminate wheat weeds (bunt spores) (see the "Prevention and Control of Diseases and Pests" booklet issued by the Border Government Agricultural and Forestry Department). These methods are simple, easy to implement, and very effective. Cadres at all levels leading production must master this technology, convene meetings, make special arrangements, personally demonstrate typical examples, to promote the entire village, district, and county to make concrete achievements. All agricultural extension stations and extension workers must select areas and personally teach technology to promote implementation.
		All Autumn Land Ploughed 	Fallow Land Can Eliminate Insects
	(3) Autumn Plowing: Autumn plowing is a fundamental method to eliminate insect pests. It is not only simple and easy to implement, but also has the greatest effect. Universally implementing one autumn plowing can eliminate at least half of the insect disasters. This year requires early plowing and deep plowing. All land that can be ploughed should strive to avoid leaving unploughed land. Early plowing can allow the land to rest early, get more sun, and be strong next year; deep plowing can restore the land that has been cultivated shallowly year by year to its original depth, deepening it by three or four tenths of an inch to four or five tenths of an inch each year. After several months of sun and weathering, raw soil can be transformed into cultivated soil. Yanbei, Chahar South, and areas with climates unsuitable for wheat planting should concentrate their efforts to lead a campaign for autumn plowing, to correct the crude cultivation methods of planting on unploughed land in previous years and lay the foundation for improving agricultural production by one inch next year. In places where rice stem borers have occurred, rice stubble should be picked up and burned in conjunction with autumn plowing to completely eliminate stem borers. In autumn plowing, in addition to mobilizing the masses to purchase livestock themselves, providing loan support, and organizing human and animal labor exchange; attention should also be paid to the quantity of livestock in different regions, the busy and slack seasons, and, based on the principle of equal value and willingness, calling on the masses with surplus livestock power to sell yokes and sell labor (no coercion or interference is allowed for any reason) to regulate the shortage of livestock power.
	(4) Organizing all labor is the central link to complete the autumn harvest, wheat planting, and autumn plowing. Based on the principle of voluntary and equal value, good organization of mutual labor assistance should be done, and family participation should be vigorously promoted. This is a good method to mobilize women and children to participate in production and solve the shortage of labor. For military, worker, martyr families, and families of conscripted laborers who lack labor, the greatest attention must be paid to earnestly organizing substitute harvesting and plowing to help them solve their difficulties. Party, government, people's rear-service organs, and troops, schools, and civilian laborers supporting the front should all take out possible time to help the masses locally. The first priority is to help military, worker, martyr families, and families of conscripted laborers who lack labor.
	Leading organs at all levels should pay attention to resolving the contradiction between autumn harvesting, wheat planting, autumn plowing and other work. During this period, with the exception of necessary war mobilization, all work must be centered on production and carried out in conjunction. Sufficient time should be allowed for production work to ensure that agricultural timing is not missed.

　　北岳行署发出详细指示
  　组织劳力完成三秋
    【北岳电】北岳行政公署于八月三十一日发出关于秋收、种麦、秋耕工作的指示。原文如下：  　（一）秋收工作：秋收工作要按不同地区提出不同任务。巩固其首先要做到收割及时，熟一片收一片，做到不遭风灾和秋雨损失；在边沿区和游击区必须实行劳武结合，百倍警惕敌人的抢粮阴谋。各地方兵团、武工队及民兵，要主动出击掩护秋收。党政领导机关要抓紧组织农民抢收、抢割、快打、快藏，并加强缉私，不使敌人强征、强买、抢走一粒粮食。
    不论巩固区或游击区，都要将田间选种作为今年秋收的重要任务。几年来作物品种杂劣，病害十分严重。不少地方谷子因有“露心”或“看谷老”，致减产已达百分之十五。玉茭、高粱、黍稷等，因黑疸致减收百分之十至二十。田间选种是减少作物传染病害，达到粮食增产基本方法之一。各地要切实研究广泛宣传察哈尔日报八月二十七日所载选种方法，并专门召开实业助理员、实业委员以及老农座谈会，布置执行督促检查，做出具体成绩，打下选种的基础，逐渐改变农民不选种或在场里选的落后习惯。所选种子要晒干，放在干燥凉爽的地方，不要挂在房檐下，以免风吹、雨打、日晒、烟薰。
    　　　　组织田间选种　准备充足肥料
    为保护农民一年的劳动成果，各地应建立看田组织，制定护秋公约，严防破坏分子偷盗破坏。察南、雁北尤应格外注意。
    （二）种麦工作：今年雨多好种麦。适宜种麦的水地和好旱地，应该尽量多种；但土壤不宜种麦，或因地瘦种麦反而减产的坏地，或因夏旱麦后不能及时播种的旱地，不应勉强多种。今年领导种麦的重点：
    一、大力解决肥料问题：去年种麦肥料不足，是今年麦子减产的重要原因。今秋种麦时，要求多下垫本，充分施肥，凡能送到地里的各种肥料，都要先尽麦田使用；（明年春播的肥料，可抓紧农闲继续压肥、积肥、修渠放淤，早作准备。）如仍感不足，应提倡使用黑豆麻糁等辅助。对军、工、烈属和贫苦户的缺肥困难，应注意以互助和农贷帮助其解决。确有需要，又肯下垫本的贫苦农家，种麦缺乏肥料，可以专作肥料贷款。
    二、为了有效地防除黑穗病，今年要努力推行两开封一凉的温水浸种，或一斤种子七钱元花枣酒（粮食酒可略少）的拌种方法，以及细筛、盐水、泥水、风车等淘汰麦莠子（王母瘤）的方法（详见边府农林处印发之防除病虫害小册子），这些办法简单易行，效力很好。各级领导生产的干部，都须掌握这个技术，并召开会议，专作布置，亲自下手典型示范，以推动全村、全区、全县作出具体成绩。各农场推广场推广员，均须选定地区，亲自动手传授技术，推动进行。
    　　　　秋地全部耕过　歇地又能灭虫
    （三）、秋耕地：秋耕地是消灭虫害的治本方法。不但简单易行，而且效果最大，普遍实行一次秋耕，虫灾至少可以免除一半。今年要求早耕深耕，凡能耕过的地，争取不留白茬地。早耕可以使地早得休息，多晒太阳，明年力壮；深耕可将逐年耕浅的土地恢复到原有的深度，每年加深三四分至四五分，经过几个月的日晒风化，生土可以变成熟土。雁北、察南及气候不宜种麦的地区，更应集中力量，领导突击秋耕，以改正历年种白茬地的粗劣耕作方法，打下明年农业生产提高一寸的基础。在发生过谷钻心虫的地方，要结合秋耕拾去谷茬烧掉，以求彻底消灭钻心虫。秋耕地中，除发动群众自购牲畜，贷款扶助，组织人畜变工外；还应注意不同地区牲口多寡，季节忙闲，在等价自愿的原则下，号召群众有剩余畜力者卖犋、卖工（不得以任何理由加以勉强或干涉），以调剂畜力之不足。
    （四）组织全部劳动力是完成收秋、种麦、秋耕工作的中心环节。应该根据自愿等价的原则，很好的组织拨工互助，并大力提倡全家下手。这是发动妇女儿童参加生产，解决劳力不足的良好方法。对于缺乏劳动力的军、工、烈属及出征民工家属，更要以最大的注意，切实组织代收、代耕，帮助他们解决困难。各级党、政、民后方机关及部队、学校、支前民工，均须抽出可能的时间，就地帮助群众。首先是帮助缺乏劳力的军、工、烈属，出征民工家属。
    各级领导机关要注意解决秋收种麦秋耕工作与其他工作的矛盾。在此期间，除必要的战争动员外，一切工作均须以生产为中心，结合进行。要给生产工作留出充裕的时间，保证做到不误农时。
