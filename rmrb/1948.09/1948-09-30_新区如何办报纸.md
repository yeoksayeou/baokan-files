How to Run a Newspaper in a New Area
    Chen Kehan

　　Judging from the three letterpress newspapers already published in the Central Plains, a common weakness at present is the lack of characteristics of newspapers in new areas, with little or no difference from newspapers in old areas. In general, various places are using the experience and methods of running newspapers in old areas to run newspapers in new areas. This is the case whether from the perspective of the target audience, editorial policy, content, or layout format. When the Xin Luoyang Bao was first launched, it also published some reader Q&A, which was quite helpful in answering questions from the masses in the new area, but this was later cancelled. Such newspaper publishing obviously cannot establish a close relationship with the local masses. How to run newspapers well in new areas is indeed worthy of study. Here are some personal views.

　　(1) On the Issue of the Target Audience

　　Old area newspapers generally target our cadres (mainly rural work cadres) as the main audience, and educate the broad masses of illiterate and semi-literate people through these cadres. This was generally suitable in the old areas in the past. In today's increasingly expanded situation, with the number of newly liberated areas and cities increasing, and the scope of readers becoming increasingly complex, whether old area newspapers should continue to maintain the old methods without any change is an issue that needs to be studied. However, old areas still have many conditions that allow newspapers to be close to the masses. For example, old areas, from the border region to the district and village, have formed a systematic organization, with cadres working at all levels, and with national elementary schools, mass night schools, blackboard newspapers, rooftop broadcasting stations, etc. as auxiliary tools, newspapers can be passed on to the masses through village cadres, elementary school teachers, intellectuals, and students. At the same time, rural culture in the old areas is backward, and few people can directly read newspapers. Most of those with some knowledge have joined the work force and become cadres. The general masses, after ten years of struggle, living together with our Party and our army, have greatly improved their political awareness, and their life forms and ideological forms have undergone great changes, and have formed a close relationship with the cause of our Party and our army. Therefore, the form of the Party's newspapers is relatively easy for the masses to accept. However, in the new area, in addition to still being able to and still should educate the broad masses through cadres (they are the leaders and backbone of the masses), there are many conditions that are different from the old area:

　　First, we have not yet formed a complete organization of the Party, government, and mass organizations, and there are very few cadres. The existing cadres have not yet fully gained the trust of the masses. Of course, cadres will gradually grow among the masses, and their connection with the masses will become increasingly close, but this requires a transition period.

　　Second, the cultural level of the masses is higher than that of the old areas. The masses demand to read newspapers themselves, and when newspapers are posted on the wall, people surround them to read. Many intellectuals and businessmen want to subscribe to newspapers. Especially in cities, the masses often scrutinize newspapers word by word. And through these people, the influence of newspapers can be transmitted to a wider range of people.

　　Third, although there are many masses in the new area who directly read newspapers, their political awareness is temporarily lower than that of the masses in the old area, and there is often a considerable distance between them and the cadres in terms of thinking.

　　Because of these circumstances, in addition to still taking cadres (they are the leaders and backbone of the masses) as the main target, newspapers in the new area must also pay attention to the readers of the general masses, and pay attention to adopting appropriate methods to unify the needs of both.

　　(2) On the Issue of the Newspaper's Propaganda Policy and Content

　　New area newspapers should be different from those in the old liberated areas. This is not only based on the wider and more complex scope of readers, but more importantly, it is based on the characteristics of the new area environment. If these characteristics are not taken into account, it will not only fail to meet the needs of the masses in the new area, but also fail to meet the needs of the cadres in the new area. Old area newspapers generally take guiding the thinking of cadres, conducting policy education, reflecting and guiding mass movements and practical work in various periods as their own editorial policy. In addition to the above tasks, newspapers in the new area should focus on publicizing our basic propositions, policies, and methods, reflecting and guiding the new life of the masses, and changing many old ideas and old concepts of the masses. These tasks have been largely resolved in the old area, but they are precisely the issues that urgently need to be resolved in the new area. In terms of propaganda content, what is applicable to the old area cannot be completely applied to the new area, and often requires a lot of explanation. In addition, the new area should also have propaganda that is adapted to its own special urgency. Propaganda in the new area must take into account the following two aspects: First, as mentioned above, the political level of the masses in the new area is relatively low, and their life and thinking habits are temporarily a greater distance from us. Many things that are very common in the old area are difficult for the masses in the new area to understand. The political level of the masses can only be gradually improved with the advancement of social reforms and the deepening of our propaganda and education work. It cannot be hoped that they will undergo a miraculous transformation overnight. Second, the masses in the new area have no experience of living under the new society, but have the experience of being oppressed and ruled by Kuomintang corrupt officials and local bullies for a long time. These experiences have created a set of habits for them to view problems. Although they have felt many new things since the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, such as speaking kindly, not visiting people's homes casually, and officials not putting on airs, many people still see it as an ordinary change of dynasty, with the old rulers being driven away and the new rulers coming. These people easily use the experience of the old society to measure all our measures, often maintaining a skeptical attitude, and even taking a negative view. This old habit of thinking is not easy to break without a considerable period of correct work and propaganda. Therefore, many things need to be explained from one, two, and three, they need to be explained repeatedly, they need to be educated in connection with their own life experiences and interests, and they must be proven by action before they will truly accept them. Here are some examples:

　　1. Some old area cadres and new recruits, heading south in a steady stream, talked to the masses in the new area, saying that three brothers in his family had joined the army (which is of course a special case in the old area), and had not returned home for several years, expressing their glory. The masses in the new area were very surprised. They suspected that there was a famine north of the Yellow River, which caused so many people to go south, suspected that our conscription was even more severe than the Kuomintang, drawing three out of three, suspected how the parents and wives at home would live if the whole family went to war, and suspected whether the People's Liberation Army would allow soldiers to go home to see their families.

　　2. Reasonable burden, stipulating five dou as the exemption point. This was originally a very reasonable and ordinary provision, but when it was first announced in the new area, rumors almost everywhere said that the common people had five dou of their own, and the rest had to be handed over to the granary. Only after actual calculation and work in the grain requisition, did the masses understand what the exemption point was all about.

　　3. The troops stationed helped the masses harvest wheat. The common people thought that "the army wants reputation" and thought that we were just pretending, saying: "Let them cut a little bit." Only when we really took action and worked hard did they believe that "it is different from Tang Enbo's troops."

　　Therefore, do not think that things that we understand or that the masses in the old area are accustomed to, the masses in the new area can also accept and understand in the same way.

　　What exactly should the new area especially publicize? I think there are the following items:

　　1. Compare the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the "Central Army" and the People's Liberation Army, the special agent Baojia rule and the people's democratic government, explaining the two kinds of people, the two kinds of nature, the two societies, the two systems, the two kinds of methods, and the two kinds of wars, all of which are different. Dig out all the dirty things from the Kuomintang's smelly toilet and criticize them (do not think that this is a thing of the past and does not need to be publicized, but the masses should often recall it), and expound our basic program, propositions, policies, and methods of new democracy. We must constantly expose and crack down on the Kuomintang reactionaries' rumors and deceptions. Tell the masses that they should look at the words of the Kuomintang reactionaries from the opposite side, but they should not look at us with the eyes of the old society, otherwise they will be fooled. In this way, the masses can recognize the enemy and us, form a basic understanding of us, and break the masses' habit of looking at problems with the experience of the old society. At the same time, we must be good at utilizing and developing the good traditions and experiences of the masses, and guide them to use them to attack the ruling faction of the old society and the reactionary armed forces.

　　2. Publicize victory, use the enthusiastic facts of the masses to explain the reasons for victory (break the fear of airplanes, the fear of atomic bombs, and the fear of the United States), the close relationship between our victory and the vital interests of the masses, and the different nature, purpose, and future of the anti-revolutionary war of US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek and our liberation war.

　　3. Current affairs propaganda, explaining that we have always advocated peace, and now we are willing to end the war as soon as possible and realize true peace and democracy; the civil war was caused by the US and Chiang; today, if we do not eliminate the Kuomintang reactionary army, overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary rule, expel the aggressive forces of US imperialism, solve the land problem, confiscate bureaucratic capital, and establish a democratic government, China will not have peace and democracy. We must publicize the facts of US imperialism's aggression against China and Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country. This kind of national issue propaganda is especially needed in towns and cities and for intellectuals.

　　4. We must stabilize the people's hearts, publicize the elimination of bandits, stabilize order, protect the lives and property of law-abiding people, implement the three main rules of discipline and the eight points for attention, maintain political integrity, fairness, and justice, save the people's strength, rationally bear the burden, oppose theft and sabotage, reward agricultural and industrial production, and make it possible for the people to get a chance to live as much as possible.

　　5. Publicize various policies, especially the armed policy, the burden policy, the industrial and commercial policy, the policy of striving for and uniting intellectuals, the judicial system, the marriage system, and the attitude towards Kuomintang local teams, bandits, and other enemy personnel. The propaganda of each policy must explain why it is stipulated in this way, what is the relationship with the people, and what is the specific method of this policy. It should be simple and clear, and use fewer words that are difficult for the masses in the new area to understand.

　　6. Systematically introduce the situation in the old liberated areas and the people's lives. Various forms such as reports, communications, novels, and poems can be used, each article introduces one thing, in a simple and popular way, starting from daily ordinary things. This work is best done by the general office's oral broadcast.

　　7. A column for cadre study should be specially set up. In addition to policy and strategy education, we must also conduct ideological and style education, otherwise, even if there are good policies and strategies, it will be difficult to implement them and difficult to overcome empiricism and blind phenomena. We must promote and commend the practice of investigating and researching everything from practical experience, and oppose and criticize the practice of arbitrarily applying old experience regardless of time and place. We must promote and commend the style of hard work and simplicity, seeking benefits for the people, and connecting with the masses, and oppose the arrogance and self-importance of old cadres, relying solely on administrative orders, as well as the tendency of newly grown district and village cadres to learn the style of old Baojia chiefs.

　　(3) On the Issue of Editing Methods

　　Currently, Xinhua News Agency manuscripts account for more than one-half or even three-quarters of the newspaper, with very few local news items, only four or five or seven or eight, and many of these few local news items reflect the internal work of the troops, government, and organs, and have less relationship with the people's lives. The forms are the same, generally the first edition is important news, the second edition is local news, the third edition is liberated area news, and the fourth edition is international and Chiang area news, which is not very lively. This editing method needs to be changed. Local news in the new area should constitute the main content of the newspaper, at least accounting for one-third of the space, and this local news, in addition to reporting the work done by the Party, troops, government, and cadres in various aspects for the people, should also directly reflect the lives and activities of the people. As for the adoption of Xinhua News Agency manuscripts, it should not be unplanned, simply filling the page, but should be carefully selected, edited, and cut according to the local situation (instructive and documentary articles and news should not be changed). New area newspapers are very much in need of a comprehensive supplement, the content of which is mainly to publicize the Party's basic propositions and policies in a popular way, answer various questions from readers, and introduce new life and new knowledge.

　　新区如何办报纸
    陈克寒
    从中原已出版的三个铅印报纸看来，目前一个共同的弱点，是缺乏新区报纸的特色，与老区报纸很少差别，或没有差别。各地大体还是以老区办报的经验，办法，在办新区报纸。无论从宣传对象，编辑方针，内容，编排形式看，都是如此。新洛阳报在初办时还刊登一些读者问答，颇能解答新区群众疑问，但后来也取消了。这样的办报，显然不能与当地群众发生亲切关系。新区报纸究竟如何办好，实有研究必要。兹将个人所见写出。
  　（一）关于宣传对象问题
    老区报纸一般是以我们的干部（基本是农村工作干部）作为主要对象，通过这些干部来教育广大的文盲半文盲群众，这在老区过去是大体适合的。在今天局势日益开展，新解放地区日益扩大，城市日益增多，读者范围日益复杂，老区报纸是否还照旧维持过去办法，一成不变，已是需要研究的问题。但老区总还存在许多条件，可使报纸与群众接近。比如，老区由边区到区村，都已形成一套系统的组织，层层都有干部工作，并有国民小学、民众夜校、黑板报、屋顶广播台等等作为辅助工具，报纸可经由村干部、小学教员、知识分子、学生传到群众中去。同时，老区农村文化落后，很少群众能直接读报，稍有知识者大部已参加工作，成为干部。而一般群众，经过十年的斗争，与我党我军共同生活，政治觉悟大大提高，生活形态和思想形态都已有很大变化，与我党我军事业已结成亲密的关系。因此，党的报纸采取那样的形式，比较容易为群众所接受。但在新区，除了仍然可以、仍然应当通过干部去教育广大群众以外，还有许多与老区不相同的条件：
    第一，是我们目前还未形成一套党的、政府的、民众团体的完整组织，干部很少，已有的干部目前也尚未完全取得群众的信赖。当然，干部会逐渐众群众中生长，他们与群众的联系也将日益亲密，但这需要一个过渡期间。
    第二，是群众文化水平比老区高，群众要求自己读报，报纸贴在墙上，就有人围着读。许多知识分子和商人要订阅报纸。尤其是在城市，群众对于报纸常常逐字逐句推敲。而经过这些人却能把报纸的影响传达到较广大的群众中去。
    第三，新区直接读报的群众虽然多，但是他们的政治觉悟暂时却要比老区的群众低些，他们与干部在思想上往往有一段不小的距离。
    因为这些情形，新区报纸除了仍然应当以干部（他们是群众的领袖和骨干）为主要对象以外，必须同时注意一般群众的读者，并注意采取适当的方法，把两者的需要统一起来。
  　（二）关于报纸的宣传方针和内容问题
    新区报纸应与老解放区的有所不同，这不但是从读者范围较为广大与复杂出发，更重要的是从新区环境的特点出发。如果不顾及这些特点，就不但不能满足新区群众的需要，而且也不能满足新区干部的需要。老区报纸一般以指导干部思想，进行政策教育，反映和指导各个时期的群众运动和实际工作为自己的编辑方针。新区报纸，除了上述任务以外，应该着重宣传我们的基本主张、政策、办法，反映和指导群众新的生活，改变群众的许多旧思想，旧观念，这些任务在老区大体上已经解决了，而在新区却正是迫切需要解决的问题。在宣传内容上，适用于老区的不能完全适用于新区，同时常须加以很多的解释，此外，新区还应有适应自己特殊紧要的宣传。新区宣传，必须照顾下列两方面的情况：第一，是上面说过的新区群众政治水平较低，生活和思想的习惯暂时与我们有一段较大的距离，许多事情在老区说来是很普通的，在新区群众却是很难理解的。而群众的政治水平，却只能随着社会改革的推进，以及我们宣传教育工作的深入，而逐步提高，不能希望他们一个早上就奇迹式地突变。第二，是新区群众没有在新社会下生活的经验，却有在国民党贪官土劣下面长期受压迫受统治的经验，这些经验造成他们一套习惯的看问题的方法。他们对于解放军的到达，虽然已感到有许多新鲜事物，比如说话和气，不串门子，当官的没有架子等，但是许多人仍看作是普通的改朝换代，旧的统治者打跑，新的统治者来了。这些人对于我们的一切措施，很容易以旧社会的经验来衡量，常常保持怀疑态度，甚至作反面看法。这种旧的思想习惯，非经相当时期正确的工作和宣传，很不容易打破。因此，许多事情都需要从一、二、三说起，都需要反复的说明解释，都需要与他们本身的生活经验和利益联系起来进行教育，而且必须以行动证明，然后他们才会真正接受。这里不妨举些例子：
    一、老区干部和新兵，源源南征，有些和新区群众交谈，说他家兄弟三人全家参军（这在老区当然也是特殊情形），出来数年都未回家，表示不胜光荣。新区群众听到很惊讶，他们怀疑黄河北面闹灾荒，以致这许多人南下，怀疑我们征兵比国民党还利害，三丁抽三，怀疑全家出征，家里父母妻子如何生活，怀疑解放军是否允许当兵的回家看看。
    二、合理负担，规定五斗为免征点。这本来是一个很合理很普通的规定，但新区在初宣布时却几乎到处发生流言，说老百姓自有五斗，其余都得交囤。只有在征粮中经过实际的计算和工作，群众才懂得免征点是怎样回事。
    三、驻军帮助群众割麦，老百姓认为“军队要名誉”，以为我们是装样子的，说：“让他们割一点吧。”等到我们真正出手，十分卖力，才相信“与汤恩伯的队伍不同”。
    因此，决不要以为我们懂得或老区群众习以为常的事物，新区群众，也可以同样接受和理解。
    新区究竟应当特别宣传些什么呢？我认为有如下数项：
    一、对比国民党与共产党，“中央军”与解放军，特务保甲统治与人民民主政府，说明两种人，两种性质，两个社会，两个制度，两种办法，两种战争，一切不同。把国民党臭毛厕中的脏东西都掏出来加以批判（不要以为这已是过去的事，可以不必宣传，而要群众经常回忆才好），把我们新民主主义的基本纲领，主张，政策，办法加以阐扬。对于国民党反动分子的造谣欺骗，要经常揭发和打击。告诉群众对于国民党反动分子的话都应从反面来看，而对我们却不应以对旧社会的眼光来看，否则就会上当。这样来使群众认清敌我界线，形成对我们的基本认识，打破群众以旧社会经验看问题的方法。同时又要善于利用和发扬群众中的好的传统和经验，引导他们用于打击旧社会的统治派，和反动武装。
    二、宣传胜利，用群众热心的事实宣传，说明胜利的原因（打破恐飞机病，恐原子弹病和恐美病），我们的胜利与群众的切身利害关系，美帝和蒋介石的反革命战争和我们的解放战争的不同性质，目的和前途。
    三、时事宣传，说明我们向来主张和平，现在也愿早日结束战争，实现真正的和平民主；内战是美蒋造成的；今天不消灭国民党反动军队，不推翻国民党反动统治，不驱逐美帝侵略势力，不解决土地问题，不没收官僚资本，不建立民主政府，中国就不会有和平民主。要宣传美帝侵略中国和蒋介石卖国的事实，在城镇和对知识分子，尤需此种民族问题宣传。
    四、要安定民心，宣传肃清土匪，安定秩序，保护守法人民的生命财产，实行三大纪律八项注意，政治廉洁公正，节省民力，合理负担，反对偷盗破坏，奖励农工生产，尽可能使人民得到生息机会。
    五、宣传各种政策，尤其是武装政策、负担政策、工商政策、争取和团结知识分子政策、司法制度、婚姻制度、对国民党地方团队、土匪和其他敌方人员态度。每一政策的宣传，都须说明为何如此规定，与人民有何关系，这一政策的具体办法如何，要简单明了，少用新区群众所难懂的字眼。
    六、系统介绍老解放区的情形，与人民生活。可用报告、通讯、小说及诗歌等各种形式，每篇介绍一件事，浅近通俗，从日常普通的事情说起。这工作最好由总社口语广播来做。
    七、要专设干部学习一栏。除政策策略教育以外，更要进行思想和作风的教育，否则即有好的政策策略，也会难以贯彻，难以克服经验主义和盲目现象。要提倡和表扬调查和研究一切从实际经验出发的作法，而反对和批评那种不同时间地点，任意套用老经验的作法。要提倡和表扬艰苦朴素，为民谋利，联系群众的作风，而反对那种老干部的骄傲自大，专靠行政命令，以及本地新生长的区村干部学习旧保甲长派头的倾向。
  　（三）关于编辑方法问题
    目前各报新华社稿件占了二分之一以上，乃至四分之三，地方新闻很少，只有四五条或七八条，而这寥寥数条地方新闻，许多又是反映部队、政府、机关等的内部工作，与人民生活较少关系。形式千篇一律，大体一版是要闻，二版地方新闻，三版解放区新闻，四版国际和蒋区新闻，很不活泼。这样的编辑方法需要改变。应该以新区的地方消息构成报纸的主要内容，至少应占三分之一篇幅，而且这种地方新闻除了报导党的、部队的、政府的和各方面的干部为人民所作的工作以外，还应多直接反映人民的生活和活动。至于新华社稿件的采用，不应是无计划的，以填满版面了事，而应经过严格选择，根据当地情况，进行编辑和剪裁（指示性和文件性的文章新闻，则不应改动）。新区报纸很需要有综合性的副刊，内容主要是用通俗方法宣传党的基本主张政策，解答读者各种疑问，介绍新的生活和新的知识。
