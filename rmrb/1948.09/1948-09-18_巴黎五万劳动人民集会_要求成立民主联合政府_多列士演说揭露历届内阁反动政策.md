Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. TASS reports: 50,000 working people in Paris held a mass rally on the 9th, chaired by Duclos, leader of the French Communist Party's parliamentary group. From the meeting hall to the streets, crowds gathered around loudspeakers to listen to the speeches. After Duclos delivered the opening remarks, Maurice Thorez, Secretary-General of the French Communist Party, delivered a speech exposing the anti-labor and anti-republican reactionary policies of successive cabinets. He emphatically pointed out the continuous rise in prices, the freezing of low wages, the increasing number of strikes, and the widespread dissatisfaction of the working masses, which was further aggravated by the Marshall Plan. He emphasized what kind of government the French people were demanding, saying: The people demand the formation of a democratic, united government trusted by the working class, relying on the support of the working class and the entire nation to implement a program for national salvation. This government should abolish all agreements and treaties that endanger French national independence, adopt a friendly and peaceful policy with all countries, and remember that the cause of France's suffering lies in denying the importance and role of the Soviet Union in Europe and the world. He said: What we want is a government that faithfully fulfills its obligations, defends France's sacred rights to security and reparations, immediately ends the war in Vietnam, and ends the shameful colonial activities in Madagascar and throughout the French Federation; this government should reorganize the army along democratic lines, and reduce the military budget by at least 200 billion francs; this government should bring about a new increase in production, improve the living conditions of the working masses and increase the tax on capitalists' profits; this government should stop persecuting true patriotic people and participants in the resistance movement, and fight against the enemies of the republic united around de Gaulle. After Thorez's speech, the assembly passed a resolution demanding the establishment of a democratic coalition government and fully agreeing with the position of the French Communist Party as listed by Thorez.
