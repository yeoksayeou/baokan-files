　　Insect Pests Still Severe in North China
  　Leaders at All Levels Should Vigorously Organize Continued Eradication
    [This newspaper dispatch] In recent months, insect pests have occurred successively in various places. In Jinnan, with the exception of Linqing, all the remaining forty-one counties have been universally affected, with the second and fourth districts being the most severely affected. In Jizhong, twenty-seven counties (including Xinji City), more than 3,400 villages, and in the fifth district of Beiyue, the seven counties of Yi, Man, Xu, Ding, Wan, Tang, and Wang, more than 170 villages in thirty districts, as well as the Jingxing area of the fourth special district and the Wei County area of the sixth special district, have also experienced insect pests. Secondly, in the Taihang area, after locusts were captured and eliminated in seventeen counties, small insects and black ladybugs have now appeared in the valleys of She County, Qi County, Neiqiu, Wu'an, and Lin County; Insect pests have also occurred in individual areas of Taiyue and Jilu豫 (Chengwu, Neihuang, Shanghe, etc.). Among them, the most harmful are armyworms, aphids, corn borers, and locust nymphs. In more than a dozen counties in Jinnan, such as Yuanchao, En County, Feixiang, Nangong, Fudong, and Hengshui, the most severely affected areas have four or five corn borers per corn stalk. Once the corn is bitten by insects, the ears immediately wither and fall over. In the third district of Guangping, corn affected by insect pests accounts for 50%, and other areas have armyworms and various other pests, and the disaster is quite common. Feixiang and Qizhi have the most severe locust nymphs eating grain. In Jizhong, the ninth and eleventh districts are more severely affected by insect pests, with the most severely affected villages accounting for 26-27% of the affected villages, and some areas have no harvest. In the four districts of insect-affected counties, statistics show that more than 33,000 mu of crops and 152,471 mu of cotton have been damaged. More than 1,000 mu of cotton in Beiyi Village, Bono, has no harvest, some cotton has been completely replanted, and even those that have not been replanted have suffered a 60% reduction in yield. In Shulu, armyworms initially occurred only in the ninth district, but now they are also commonly found in the fifth, fourteenth, and seventeenth districts. In the Shancheng area of the fifth district, the late grain has had its ears eaten by insects. Secondly, in Luancheng, Zhao County, Ningjin, Shulu, Shen County, and Anguo, the disaster is also very serious in most areas. The heavy grain and late corn are bitten into bare stalks, and the light ones are also bitten into mottled leaves. Armyworms have universally occurred in the counties of Yi, Man, Xu, Ding, Wan, Tang, and Wang in the fifth district of Beiyue. Most of them have just been eradicated, and black small armyworms have universally occurred. Statistics show that in addition to grain, corn, and cotton, other rice (Anxin, Pingshan), mung beans (Renqiu), and sorghum (Qinghe) have also been damaged by insects in some areas. Thus, insect pests in various regions have caused widespread disasters.
    At present, Party, government, military, and civilians schools in various places are combining with the broad masses to enthusiastically carry out insect eradication campaigns, adopting various effective methods for insect eradication, and have achieved great results and experience:
    　　　　Some Counties and Districts Do Not Pay Enough Attention, Resulting in the Spread of Insect Pests Throughout the Area
    (1) The first is that the leadership attaches importance to grasping and eliminating them: On August 4th, the Fifth Special District of Beiyue discovered that armyworms had occurred in various counties, and immediately issued two notices, calling on all Party, government, and civilian cadres to earnestly supervise and inspect with the spirit of being responsible to the people, and to conscientiously prevent development, and immediately conducted capture and suppression in areas where insect pests had occurred. Chen Xi, the county head of Mancheng, personally led a pest inspection team to inspect various districts and help the masses capture and suppress pests. In the XuShui county-level agencies, in addition to the personnel left behind by the agencies, combined with the training class to help the village residents capture and suppress, and the rest of the cadres went to the countryside to fight armyworms. At present, the first batch of yellow old armyworms has been largely eliminated, and the second batch of black small armyworms is being eliminated. After the discovery of insect pests in the second district of Jinnan, the prefectural committee personally instructed the counties on the telephone, that wherever insect pests were discovered, the masses should be immediately organized to eliminate them. The areas that have now been basically eliminated are Jize, Yuanchao, Qiu County, and two districts in Qinghe, ten districts in Gaotang, the northern part of four districts in Wu'an, and the southern part of two districts in Xiajin. Some are also starting to act while calling on others. On August 14th, the Eleventh District of Jizhong issued an emergency call to all levels of the Party, government, military, and civilians in the district, vigorously organizing the elimination of pests. Comrade Guo Fang, secretary of the prefectural committee, personally led 47 cadres from the agency, combined with the Party school and the No. 2 Middle School, to help the masses catch insects in the fields. Within five days, they generally sprayed the insects twice on more than 1,700 mu of land, and even six times in some cases, which had a great impact on the masses. However, in some places, they do not pay attention to insect pests. For example, in many areas of the counties in the eighth district of Jizhong, armyworms and fire spiders have appeared, and some areas are even very serious, such as some villages in the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth districts of Xianjiao. Facing such insect pests, they actually used the excuse that the young and middle-aged people were all on the embankment to block the water, and it was difficult to mobilize the masses, so they ignored them. The ninth district of Renqiu initially completely ignored the discovery of insect pests, and even when it spread throughout the district, it still focused on "distributing floating wealth and sweeping the tails of the land." Although it was reviewed and changed later, it was too late, causing the masses to suffer avoidable losses.
    (2) The most important thing is to mobilize the masses and organize the masses, and use practical examples to overcome the superstitious ideas and concerns of the masses: When armyworms were first discovered in Chaigezhuang, Wan County, the village deputy asked the masses to contribute 10,000 yuan per household, and collected 256,000 yuan to buy livestock to offer to the "Insect King", but the pests became more and more rampant. On August 3rd, after the cadres of the county's industrial department and three comrades from the Border Region Technology Promotion Brigade arrived in the village, they seized the example of Yin Dezi, who went hungry two years ago because he did not fight armyworms, to educate the masses, and mobilized and helped the masses to capture and suppress them. When armyworms were rampant two years ago, Yin Dezi was superstitious and did not fight insects, and the crops were eaten up by insects, and he went hungry himself. This year, as soon as he saw armyworms in the field, he and his mother pushed the armyworm cart to the field to capture and suppress them without waiting for the cadres to mobilize. He said: "Whoever wants to believe in gods can believe in them, anyway, I don't believe in them. The previous year hurt me, and I went hungry myself if I couldn't grow food!" The masses in the whole village were organized, and 23 village cadres were responsible for each street and area, and the armyworms on more than 400 mu of land were killed in three days.
    　　　　On-the-Spot Education to Break Superstition; Free Association to Help Each Other Eradicate Insects
    In addition, special attention should be paid to the method of fighting insects: In the Wencheng Township area of Jizhong, 16 villages with 1,043 mu of land had armyworms. Some villages let the masses fight in a disorganized manner, a large group of people squeezed the nodules in the field, and the children trampled and ran around, destroying more than seven mu of grain, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Cao Xingbang's daughter-in-law said: "Are you catching insects for me? You are hitting my rice bowl!" Sun Jichen of Dabao Village blocked the insect eradication team from entering the field at the edge of the field and said: "You must give me the grain, I will cut all the grain, or it will be ruined and there will be no food." After hitting a snag, the district and village cadres made a review, mainly because they did not listen to the masses and subjectively forced the masses to collect insects collectively. A forum for landowners was also held, and according to the opinions of the masses, small groups were freely and voluntarily formed, and the whole family went to the field to encourage everyone to protect crops and eliminate pests. The masses in Zhao Village went to the field early in the morning with ducks. The people in the front knocked, and the ducks in the back followed to eat. Zhan Baotang said: "This is so good, it doesn't ruin the crops and it's fast to catch." After the transformation of the method in Nanchengzi, Tang County, the heads of households mobilized the whole family to combine with the neighbors and the land to go to the field to catch insects, and the enthusiasm was very high and the efficiency was great. Similar examples can be found in Anguo in Jizhong and Jize and Nangong in Jinnan. In addition, specific leadership and unified action have been noted. Nanliushan and other villages in Suning proposed that "if one family does not take it, the four neighbors will suffer, and everyone will help each other to supervise and help capture." The whole village organized an insect control committee to lead in a unified manner, and the cadres were responsible for taking care of the three families of military martyrs and industrial workers and the lonely and widowed without labor, and they did not let the insects damage the crops. The cadres of Hongshan Village in Wu'an, Taihang, led the masses to catch black ladybugs. Everyone took a small pocket and caught two or three he of insects in half a day. After catching them for more than four days, they have already eliminated 70-80%.
    (3) Timely inspection and proactive prevention: Director Luo of the Jizhong Administrative Office went to the field on August 16 to inspect the insect pests. After discovering armyworms, he immediately instructed the agencies to organize and help the village residents to eliminate the pests, and showed the captured armyworms to the masses to attract the attention of the villagers. Comrade Gou Zhengge of the Brigade Department of the Second District of Yi County heard that insect pests had been discovered in neighboring villages, so he immediately went to the field to inspect. After the discovery of armyworms in Wanglizhangtun Village, the fifth district of Zaoqiang, they dug long ditches more than one foot deep and wide around the edges of the land where armyworms had not been discovered, with smooth ditch walls and small pits at one end. The armyworms could not climb into the land and fell into the small pits, and they were buried alive when there were too many. As soon as Wang Ruxing in Qudi Village, Anguo, had insects in his field, he held a family meeting and mobilized the women of the whole family to go to the field to fight insects, and the crops were not damaged.
    At present, although a campaign to eliminate insect pests has been universally launched in various places, and considerable achievements have been made, the insect disaster has not yet passed, and some areas are still continuing to spread and develop. In particular, autumn locusts, cabbage worms, black ladybugs, mole crickets, grubs (eating wheat), and armyworms have not yet exceeded the breeding season. Therefore, leaders at all levels should pay special attention to this work, resolutely overcome the paralysis of cadres and the superstitious ideas of the masses, and make further efforts to eliminate insect pests and strive for the final victory in agricultural production this year.

　　华北各地虫害仍严重
  　各级领导上应大力组织继续扑灭
    【本报讯】近月来各地陆续发生虫害。冀南除临清外，其余四十一县普遍发生，其中以二、四分区最重。冀中二十七个县（辛集市在内）三千四百多村、北岳五分区易、满、徐、定、完、唐、望七县三十个区一百七十多村及四专井陉、六专蔚县一带也都有虫害发生，其次在太行十七县蝗虫捕灭后，现涉县、淇县、内邱、武安、林县的谷地，又发生了小虫和黑婆虫；太岳、冀鲁豫（城武、内黄、尚和等县）个别地区也有虫害发生。其中为害最大的是黏虫、蚜虫、钻心虫和蝗蝻，在冀南元朝、恩县、肥乡、南宫、阜东、衡水等十几个县，虫害最严重的地方，每棵棒子上有钻心虫四、五个，棒子一经虫咬，穗子立刻枯萎歪倒。广平三区受虫害棒子占百分之五十，其他地区发生黏虫、火笼各种害虫，灾情相当普遍。肥乡、企之均发生蝗蝻吃谷最厉害。冀中以九、十一两个分区虫灾较重，其中灾情最重的村子占灾村百分之二十六、七，有的地区已无收成。虫县四区二十七个村，统计被咬坏庄稼三万三千多亩，棉花十五万二千四百七十一亩。博野北邑村一千多亩棉花已无收成，有的棉花已经全部毁种，就是没毁种的也已减收六成。束鹿最初只九区发生黏虫，现在五区、十四区、十七区也普遍发见，五区鄯城一带晚谷被虫吃掉谷穗码子。其次栾城、赵县、宁晋、束鹿、深县、安国，大部地区灾情也很严重，谷子、晚棒子重的咬成光秆，轻的也咬成花叶。北岳五专易、满、徐、定、完、唐、望各县普遍发生了黏虫，大部刚刚扑灭，黑色小黏虫又普遍发生，统计庄稼受害的除谷子棒子和棉花外，其他稻子（安新、平山）绿豆（任邱）高粱（清河）也有部分地区被虫咬坏，如此各地区虫害已造成普遍性的灾害。
    现在各地党政军民学校结合广大群众，正在热烈的开展着除虫运动。采用各种除虫有效办法，获得很大成绩和经验：
    　　　　有些县区重视不够　致使虫灾蔓延全区
    （一）首先是领导上重视抓紧扑灭：北岳五专在八月四日发见各县发生黏虫，立即发出两次通知，号召党政民全体干部以为人民负责的精神，切实督促检查，认真防止发展，并即在已发生虫害地区进行捕打。满城县长陈希亲带害虫检查组到各区检查，帮助群众捕打。徐水县级机关除留守机关人员结合训练班帮助驻村捕打，其余全体干部下乡打黏虫，现第一番黄色老黏虫大体扑灭，正在进行第二番扑灭黑色小黏虫。冀南二分区虫害发现后，地委亲在电话上指示各县，那里发现害虫，立即组织群众扑灭，现已基本上消灭的有鸡泽、元朝、邱县和清河两个区，高唐十区，武安四区北部，夏津二区南部。有的还一面号召一面动手，冀中十一分区于八月十四日向全区各级党政军民发出紧急号召，大力组织扑灭害虫，地委书记郭芳同志亲自带领机关干部四十七人结合党校和二中下地帮助群众捕虫，五天内把一千七百多亩地内的虫普遍打了两遍，有的甚至六遍，影响群众很大。但也有一些地方，对虫灾不重视，如冀中八分区各县的不少地区出了黏虫、火蛛子，有的地区甚至很严重，如献交六、七、八、九、十等区的一部分村庄，对这样的虫灾，竟借口青壮年都上堤挡水，发动群众有困难而置之不管。任邱九区最初发现虫害完全置之不理，到蔓延全区时，仍以“分浮财，扫土地尾巴”为中心，后虽经检讨转变，但为时已晚，使群众遭受了本可避免的损失。
    （二）最主要是发动群众组织群众，用实际例子来克服群众的迷信思想和顾虑：完县柴各庄开始发见黏虫时，村副让群众每户出一万元，共集了廿五、六万元买牲羊供献“虫王”，但是害虫却越闹越多。八月三日县实业科干部和边区技术推广大队三个同志到村后，便抓住该村尹德子前年不打黏虫挨饿的例子教育群众，发动和帮助群众捕打。尹德子前年闹黏虫时迷信不打虫，庄稼被虫吃光，自己挨了饿。今年一见地里有了黏虫不等干部动员就和他娘推着黏虫车下地捕打。他说：“谁愿信神谁就信，反正我是不信了，前年个一年把我治伤了，打不下粮食自己挨饿！”全村群众组织起来，二十三个村干部，分街分片负责，三天打完了四百多亩地的黏虫。
    　　　　实地教育打破迷信　自由结组互助灭虫
    此外，特别注意打虫的方式：冀中文新城厢区有十六个村一千零四十三亩地出了黏虫。有的村无组织的让群众乱打，一大群人到地里乱挤疙疸，儿童们乱踩乱跑，踏坏了七亩多谷子，引起群众的不满。曹兴邦的媳妇说：“这是给俺拿虫吗？是打我饭碗子来啦！”大堡村孙继臣在地头拦着不让打虫队进地，并说：“一定要给我拿，我就把谷子都割喽，要不也得糟塌的不打粮食了。”碰了钉子以后，区村干部做了检讨，主要是不听群众的话，主观的强迫群众集体拿虫。又召开了地户座谈会，根据群众意见自由自愿结合了小组，全家都下地，鼓动大家保护庄稼消灭害虫。赵村的群众带着鸭子一早下地，前边人磕打，后边鸭子跟着吃，斩保堂说：“这多好，又不糟塌庄稼又拿的快。”唐县南城子在转变方式以后，各户家长动员全家结合邻居地邻二律下地拿虫子，情绪很高，效率很大。冀中安国，冀南鸡泽、南宫，均有同样的例子。另外并已注意到具体领导和统一行动。肃宁南留善等村提出“一家不拿，四邻吃亏，大伙互助督促，帮助捕打。”全村组织捕虫委员会统一领导，三家没劳力的军烈工属和孤寡，干部们负责照顾也没叫虫子咬坏庄稼。太行武安洪山村干部带领群众捉黑婆虫，每人拿个小口袋，一个人半天捉二三合，捉了四天多已经消灭了七八成。
    （三）即时检查主动预防：冀中行署罗主任于八月十六日亲到地里检查虫害，发见有黏虫以后，立即指示各机关组织起来帮助驻村扑灭害虫，又把捕到的黏虫让群众看，引起全村老乡注意。易县二区大队部苟振葛同志听说邻村发见虫害，就立刻到地里检查。枣强五区王里张屯村发见黏虫后，一面捕打一面在还没有发见黏虫的地边周围挖成深宽一尺多的长渠，渠壁光滑，一端有小坑，黏虫爬不到地里掉到小坑内，要多了就埋死它。安国曲堤村王汝兴地里刚一有虫就开了家庭会议，动员全家妇女下地打虫，庄稼没有受害。
    目前，各地虽然普遍掀起扑灭虫害的运动，且获得不小的成绩，但虫灾仍未过去，有的地区还继续蔓延发展，特别是秋蝗、菜虫、黑婆虫、蝼蛄、蛴螬（吃麦子），黏虫亦尚未逾繁殖季节，因此各级领导应特别重视此一工作，坚决克服干部麻痹和群众的迷信思想，进一步努力把虫害扑灭，争取今年农业生产最后的胜利。
