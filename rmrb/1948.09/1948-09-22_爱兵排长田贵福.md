　　"A True Brother to the Soldiers"
　　Loving-Soldier Platoon Leader Tian Guifu
	Zhang Kerang
	Comrade Tian Guifu, a meritorious hero of a certain unit's 813th Regiment, 3rd Company, 1st Platoon, is 27 years old this year. He is from Tianjiawan Village in Yuci and worked as a long-term laborer for landlords from a young age, enduring 22 years of hardship. He joined the army in 1944 and the Party in 1946. Since he arrived at the 1st Platoon, especially after the Party rectification, the 1st Platoon has become a model platoon of unity and solidarity. He is recognized by the entire platoon as "a true brother to the soldiers."
　　Brave and Decisive, He Earns Great Merit in the North and South Shangshe Battles
	In combat, Comrade Tian Guifu has consistently demonstrated bravery, composure, decisiveness, and often secures significant victories with minimal sacrifices. During the battle of North and South Shangshe on May 9th of this year, after the enemy in the river channels was annihilated, his platoon had not yet captured any prisoners or seized any weapons. The company commander ordered him and 2nd Platoon Leader Li Genfu to lead the 1st and 4th Squads, a total of 14 comrades, to annihilate the regimental headquarters of the enemy's 49th Division, 1st Regiment. The enemy numbered over 200, equipped with three heavy machine guns, four light machine guns, and more than ten light cannons, interspersed with rifles and hand grenades, all firing at them. They were suppressed by the enemy's superior firepower. Under his encouragement, a second charge was launched, during which 2nd Platoon Leader Li Genfu heroically sacrificed himself, and two other soldiers were wounded, forcing them to retreat under the enemy's fire. A third charge was launched, but they were again forced back by the enemy's firepower, causing some panic among the soldiers. Comrade Tian Guifu promptly proposed, "We must eliminate the enemy to avenge our 2nd Platoon Leader!" He also said, "Whether from the 2nd Platoon or the 1st Platoon, I will command you all." However, they only had about ten hand grenades left. He gathered the hand grenades, reorganized the group, and encouraged everyone, saying, "We must charge forward and seize the enemy's heavy machine guns and 'Czech hedgehogs'! Comrades, let's go!" As soon as he finished speaking, everyone charged forward. After using up their own hand grenades, they threw the enemy's hand grenades back at their positions. The enemy began to waver. Coincidentally, friendly forces also pressed forward, and he seized the opportunity to mislead the enemy, saying, "Look! Aren't those our troops coming from behind? Surrender quickly!" In that instant, the enemy was thrown into confusion. He led two squads and quickly charged up the hill, defeating the enemy's regimental headquarters, which led to the end of the entire battle. In this battle, he led fourteen comrades (including himself) and, with only three wounded and one dead, defeated the enemy's regimental headquarters of over 200, killing and wounding dozens of enemies, playing a decisive role in ending the entire battle, and earning great merit. During the Jinzhong Campaign, Comrade Tian Guifu continued to demonstrate bravery and tenacity, repeatedly completing arduous tasks, and was awarded another commendation.
　　Loving-Soldier Platoon Leader, a True Brother to the Soldiers
	Because Tian Guifu has a strong belief in loving the soldiers, in the seven months since the Party rectification, there have been no desertions from Tian Guifu's platoon, and he is recognized by the entire platoon as "a true brother to the soldiers."
	Tian Guifu is more considerate of soldiers and the wounded than of himself on the battlefield. Before each mission, he always shares the battle plan with everyone and discusses in the squad how to fight and how to complete the mission. Before the Dong Anzhuang battle, he explained the terrain to everyone before the assault. Before the North and South Shangshe battles, they were responsible for guarding Shili Mountain. The squad took turns on sentry duty, and he did not sleep all night. After dawn, when the soldiers were resting, he dug fortifications for an entire morning. He said, "If we sweat more in peacetime and dig good fortifications, we can avoid being harmed by the enemy's firepower, conceal our bodies, and reduce casualties." When the assault began and they were fighting the enemy with hand grenades, Squad Leader Gao Shitang and soldier Wang Wenlin were stunned by the explosions. He immediately went over and told them to take cover. Gao Shitang moved quickly and took cover, but Wang Wenlin hesitated and was wounded. He is even more concerned about the wounded. During the battles before and after the camp, 1st Squad Leader Fan Guihai was seriously wounded in the abdomen. The combat team was scattered, and the enemy was only 30 meters away from Fan. Comrade Tian Guifu led a combat team of the 2nd Squad to retreat. Seeing Fan lying there alone, he had no time to comfort him. He hurriedly took the gun from Fan's hand, resisted the enemy, and called back the 2nd Squad combat team. He used hand grenades and rifles to drive the enemy back, protecting and carrying the wounded soldier away. Later, after Fan Guihai recovered, he said with emotion whenever he mentioned the platoon leader: "If it weren't for the platoon leader, ten Fan Guihais would have been finished." After the troops returned from the Daogou battle, everyone was tired and went to sleep. Four lightly and seriously wounded were carried back to the platoon. Platoon Leader Tian went to see the wounded twice in the middle of the night, fed them water, and comforted them. He said, "Comrades shed blood for the revolution. We should be more tired." In addition to loving the soldiers on the battlefield, he usually pays close attention to improving everyone's military skills, often leading soldiers in research and conducting practical reviews after battles. Wei Guihai did not know how to use a bayonet. He explained, "We will use bayonets more in the future. If you don't learn, you will suffer." He then gave practical instruction and corrected his movements. Liu Erxiao's fortifications were not suitable, so he personally made a model and asked everyone to watch it before doing it themselves. In training, his platoon was the first to create sand table exercises, using spare time to study combat formations, field operations, formation identification, and usage. Because of this, his 1st Platoon often achieved significant victories at a small price in battle.
　　Consolidating the Troops, Helping the Sick and Injured
	Comrade Tian Guifu often said, "Consolidating the troops doesn't just mean no desertions. If soldiers get sick, it also reduces combat effectiveness." When the troops were stationed in Jiang Village, his platoon had twelve scabies patients (out of more than twenty in the entire company). Because it was a "no-man's land" created by the Yan bandits, they couldn't find an iron pot. He personally found one, gathered firewood, chopped wood, and boiled water. He personally scrubbed the scabies patients with yellow explosives from the enemy's hand grenades. Four days later, when the troops went to Shouxihuang Village and Shanqing to carry out missions, none of the twenty-plus scabies patients were left behind. In Zhonglan, he and the medic突击 treated a dozen more scabies patients. In March, Liu Jincun (a newly liberated soldier) was assigned to the 1st Platoon and had scabies all over his body, especially his neck. He thought, "The higher-ups sent him to us. Curing him means we have a good soldier." At first, Liu was unwilling to be washed, but the soldiers explained it to him, and after repeated persuasion, Liu finally started washing. But washing alone was not enough; he needed to apply medicine to get better. He and the soldiers tried to persuade him for two days and two nights, but they couldn't change Liu Jincun's strange behavior. On the third day, he washed Liu's scabies again. When he had washed to a certain point, he secretly grabbed a handful of yellow explosives and smeared it on Liu's body. Liu Jincun couldn't stand the pain and started cursing: "This is worse than you killing me with a knife!" But Platoon Leader Tian didn't get angry. He continued to explain and smear, letting him bake. After three or four times, Liu Jincun's scabies were cured, and he never cursed the platoon leader again. Instead, he said proudly: "The platoon leader cured my scabies!" In this way, he personally突击 treated more than fifty scabies patients in the entire company. During the march from the north to the south, Zhang Yongzhen had a stomach ache and hadn't eaten breakfast. He gave his dry rations to the sick soldier, going hungry himself. Chen Sanmao got sick, so he boiled water, cooked food, and washed his body. When he sweated, he found a small room for him to rest in. As a result, he recovered in three days. Chen was also night blind, so Platoon Leader Tian always led him during night marches. Later, he found sheep liver for him to eat and cured him. During marches, he often helped sick soldiers carry their guns and bedrolls. As soon as they arrived at the campsite, while the soldiers rested, he always made sure everyone drank water and washed their feet before going to sleep. At night, he was afraid the soldiers would get cold, so he went to the squad to cover them with blankets, always caring for the soldiers' hardships and health. Therefore, the soldiers often said happily and excitedly: "Our platoon leader is just like us. He carries more than us on the march!"
　　Correctly Grasping Praise and Criticism, Patiently Solving Soldiers' Ideological Problems
	He often called meetings to conduct reviews. He praised those who had merits and conducted individual talks with those who had shortcomings, one after another, until they finally understood the issues. For example, Wang Hantang was liberated from the Zhengtai Campaign last year. His family had been liquidated, and he was in low spirits. He repeatedly explained to him the reasons why poor people had turned over and told Wang: "Although your family has been liquidated, if you have difficulties, the government will take good care of you." Sure enough, a few days later, Wang's family wrote a letter saying: "Five or six mu of land have been left to the family." Platoon Leader Tian then explained: "When there was more land, the family couldn't farm it all. Although there is less land now, the village will help in every way, and the family's life will definitely not be bad." In this way, Wang Hantang's spirits rose. When guarding the post in Chengwu Village, Gao Jifu instigated him to desert. He reported it to the platoon leader. Wang was praised and became more active. He captured a light cannon in the Daogou battle. He played a significant role in attacking the regimental headquarters of the 49th Division in the North and South Shangshe battles, and captured two more small cannons. After the war, he was credited with a minor功. In the Jinzhong Campaign, he volunteered to join the demolition team to blow up Beizhao and completed the task continuously, earning another minor功.
	In order to consolidate his platoon, Comrade Tian Guifu did not relax the principled struggle against some soldiers who repeatedly refused to change despite patient education. After Gao Jifu was exposed for instigating Wang Hantang to desert, he immediately launched a struggle in the entire platoon to provide mass education. Wu Rengong had consistently failed to take care of his weapons. He lost two hand grenades on two trips home and casually slammed his machine gun against the wall. He was not united with the squad leader. Platoon Leader Tian had individual talks with him and criticized him at the squad meeting more than ten times, but he still did not change. After the North and South Shangshe battles, when evaluating merits, he stood aside and just "giggled." The squad leader said he didn't listen, and the platoon leader asked him to sit down several times, but he said indifferently: "I can't hear what you are saying!" Finally, at the request of the soldiers, a struggle was launched at the platoon meeting, and he was asked: "The revolutionary weapons are earned with blood and sweat. Why don't you cherish them? ......" After the meeting, Platoon Leader Tian did not relax individual education and repeatedly inspired Wu Rengong's self-awareness. He finally realized his mistake, and Platoon Leader Tian immediately helped him formulate a plan to correct his mistakes and make contributions. Wu Rengong changed, and the entire platoon became more united and consolidated.
	Comrade Tian Guifu loves soldiers, cares for soldiers, and helps soldiers. In the democratic movement, all the soldiers elected him as the consolidation of the troops committee member of the Revolutionary Soldiers Committee, and he was publicly recognized by all the comrades in the platoon as a true brother to the soldiers. At the divisional celebration meeting on August 15th, he wore the big red flower of a meritorious hero. When he spoke, he said: "I am not worthy of being a meritorious hero. I will work harder in the future and make more contributions!"

　　“战士的亲兄弟”
  　爱兵排长田贵福
    张克让
    某部大功功臣田贵福同志是八一三团三连一排长，今年廿七岁，榆次田家湾村人，从小给地主扛长工，一直过了二十二年的苦难生活。一九四四年入伍，四六年入党。自他到一排后，特别整党后，一排便成了一个巩固团结的模范排，他被全排公认为“战士的亲兄弟”。
　　英勇果敢南北上社立大功
    在战斗上，田贵福同志一贯勇敢沉着，机动果敢，常以小的代价换取大的胜利。在今年五月九日南北上社战斗时，河漕里的敌人被歼灭了，他排还未捉到俘虏缴到枪。连长命令他和二排长李根富同志带一、四班共十四个同志去歼灭敌四十九师一团的团指挥所，敌人是二百多，而且配有重机枪三挺，轻机枪四挺和十余门轻炮，夹杂着步枪、手榴弹一齐向他们打下来，他们被敌人的优势火力压下来了，在他鼓动之下，随着第二次冲锋发起了，二排长李根富同志便在这次冲锋中牺牲了，还有两个战士挂了花，被敌火力压下来。第三次又冲上去，又被敌人的火力压下来，战士们有些恐慌不安，于是田贵福同志及时提出：“咱们一定要消灭敌人，为我们的二排长报仇！”又说：“不管二排的、一排的都由我指挥。”但是他们的手榴弹打的只留下十来颗了，他把手榴弹集中起来，又重新组织了一下，鼓动大家说：“咱们一定冲上去，缴敌人的重机枪、歪把子，同志们上吧！”话刚落地，大家便冲上去了，自己的手榴弹打完，又把敌人投过来的手榴弹打到敌人的阵地上，敌人开始动摇了，恰巧友邻部队也压下来，他便趁机迷惑敌人说：“你们看！后边不是我们的部队都下来了，快缴枪吧！”就在这一刹那时间内，敌人混乱了，他带两个班迅速冲上山头把敌人的团指挥所打垮了，随着整个战斗便解决了。这次战斗，他带领的十四个（连他）同志仅以伤三、亡一的代价打垮了二百余敌人的团指挥所，毙伤敌数十名，对整个战斗的结束起了决定性作用，立了大功。在晋中战役中，田贵福同志仍表现了英勇顽强，屡次完成艰巨任务，又记功一次。
　　爱兵排长、战士的亲兄弟
    由于田贵福有坚强的爱兵观点，所以自整党以来七个多月，田贵福排一个逃亡也没有，他被全排公认为“战士的亲兄弟”。
    田贵福在战场上爱战士爱伤员比自己都周到。每次接受任务后，他总要把战斗方案告给大家，在班里讨论怎样打？怎样完成任务？董安庄战斗在冲锋前给大家讲解地形，在南北上社战斗前，他们在石梨山担任警戒，班里轮流着放哨，他一夜没睡觉，天明后战士们休息，他自己整整挖了一上午工事，他说：“平时咱多流点汗，挖好工事，不受敌人火力杀伤，隐蔽身体，减少伤亡。”冲锋开始，和敌人拼手榴弹时，班长高士堂、战士王文林被手榴弹震呆了，他马上过去叫他们隐蔽，高士堂动作快隐蔽了，王文林稍一呆挂了花。对伤员他更关心，前后营战斗，一班长范贵海腹部负重伤，战斗小组被冲散，敌人离范只有三十米远了，田贵福同志在最后带领二班一个战斗小组撤下来，见范一个人躺在那里，他来不及安慰，忙从范手里拿起枪，一面抵抗敌人，一面喊回二班战斗小组，用手榴弹、排子枪把敌人打回去，掩护着把伤员背下来，以后范贵海休养好了，一提起排长就感动的说：“要不是排长，我十个范贵海也完了。”打草沟部队回来大家都疲劳的睡觉了，排里有四个轻重彩号抬回来，田排长半夜去看了伤员两次，喂他们喝水，安慰伤员，他说：“同志们为革命流了血，咱累点是更应该的。”除战场上爱兵，他平时对大家军事素养的提高很注意，时常领导战士研究，战斗下来即进行实际检讨。魏贵海不会使刺刀，他一面解释说：“今后咱们用刺刀多，学不会就要吃亏。”一面实际教练纠正动作。刘二小工事挖的不适合，他亲自作了个样子，叫大家看了再做。在练兵中，他排首先创造了沙盘演习，利用课余时间研究战斗队形，土工作业，队形识别及使用。由于这样，他带领的一排在战斗中，常以小的代价，换取大的胜利。
　　巩固部队、帮助病员医疗
    田贵福同志常说：“巩固部队不光是没开小差的，发生了病号，同样减少了战斗力。”部队住在蒋村时，他排有十二个疥号（全连二十多个）因那里是阎匪造成的“无人区”，找不到铁锅，他亲自给找了一个，找下柴火劈柴烧水，用缴获敌人手榴弹内的黄炸药，亲自给疥号擦洗，四天后部队到寿西黄家庄、山庆执行任务，二十多个疥号都没有掉队。在中兰他又和卫生员突击好十几个疥号。三月里刘金存（解放战士）补到一排，害了满身疥，脖子里满满的，他想：“上级给补充来，治好了就是个好战士。”初给刘洗时，死不愿意，后来战士们也给解释，他再三劝说，刘才洗起来，但光洗不顶事，要擦药才会好，他和战士们说服了两天两夜，也没把刘金存那怪劲扭过来。第三天，他又给刘洗疥，洗到一定时候，他偷偷抓了一把黄炸药抹在刘身上，刘金存耐不住疼，竟骂起大街：“这还不如你拿刀杀了我呢！”但田排长不生气，仍一面解释一面给擦，让他烤，一连三，四次，刘金存的疥好了，以后再也不骂排长了，却洋洋得意的说：“排长给我的疥擦好了！”这样他亲自突击好全连五十多个疥号。部队从北线到南线行军中，张永珍肚子疼，早上也没吃饭，他把干粮让给病号吃，自己饿着。陈三毛病了，他给烧水、做饭、洗身上，出了汗又给找个小屋子养着，结果三天病就好了。陈又是个“夜瞎子”，晚上行军田排长总拉着他，后来又设法找羊肝子吃治好了。行军中他经常帮忙得病战士扛枪、背被包，一到宿营地，战士们休息，他总关心着让大家喝水洗脚后再去睡。晚上他怕战士冻着，到班里给盖被子，处处是关心着战士的疾苦和健康。因此，战士们常是愉快兴奋的讲着：“我们的排长和我们一样样的，行军比我们还背的多哩！”
　　正确掌握表扬批评、耐心解决战士思想问题
    他经常召集开会进行检讨，谁有优点就表扬，谁有缺点就接二连三的个别谈话，直到最后搞通思想。如王汉堂是去年从正太战役解放过来的，家里被清算了，情绪不高，他三番五次的给解释穷人翻身的道理，并告王说：“你家里虽然叫清算了，家里有困难，政府一定很好的照顾。”果然隔不几天，王家里来信说：“给家里留下五、六亩地。”田排长随即又给解释：“原来地多时家里种不了，这会虽然地少了，村里一切帮助，家里的生活一定赖不了。”这样王汉堂的情绪就高了起来。在城武村站岗时，郜计福勾引他开小差，他就汇报了排长，王受到表扬更积极了，他草沟战斗缴了一门轻炮，南北上社战斗，攻打四十九师一团指挥所起了很大作用，并又缴小炮两门，战后记了一小功，晋中战役打北赵自报奋勇参加爆炸组，连续完成任务又记了一小功。
    田贵福同志为巩固他的排，对一些屡经耐心教育不改的战士，并不放松原则性的斗争，郜计福勾引王汉堂开小差被揭发后，他即在全排开展斗争，给予群众性的教育。武仁功一贯不爱护武器，回了二次家丢了两个手榴弹，随便在墙上摔打机枪，和班长闹不团结，田排长和他个别谈话，在班务会上也批评有十次之多但仍未改，南北上社战斗后评功，他站在一旁只管“咯吵”，班长说他不听，排长几次让他坐下，他反满不在乎的说：“听不见你说甚哩！”最后在战士要求下，排务会上开展斗争，向他提出：“革命的武器是流血流汗换来的，你为什么不爱护武器？………………”会后，田排长不放松个别教育，再三启发武仁功的自觉，他终于认识了自己的错误，田排长即帮助他订了改过立功计划，武仁功有了转变，全排更加团结和巩固了。
    田贵福同志爱护战士，关心战士，帮助战士，在民主运动中全体士兵选他为革命军人委员会的巩固部队委员，并被全排同志公认为是战士的亲兄弟。八月十五日分区庆功大会上，他带上了大功功臣的大红花，他讲话时说：“我当这大功功臣是不够的，今后要再努力，再立功！”
