Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Comprehensive reports from various sources: Since the Kuomintang reactionary government announced the implementation of "currency reform" on the 19th of last month, freezing prices and adopting violent means to "control the economy," legitimate transactions in markets throughout its ruling areas have been paralyzed, and black market transactions and material flight have become widespread. Taking Shanghai, the economic center of the Kuomintang-controlled area, as an example, according to a Reuters report on the 10th, "Business in all industries in Shanghai has almost completely come to a standstill." "This is partly due to government regulations freezing prices, which merchants strongly resist, and partly due to the government's implementation of strict economic controls." The agency's reporter has requested the London headquarters to report the stagnation of the Shanghai market to the British government, as this situation has "seriously affected our (British) business." Furthermore, according to the agency's telegram on the same day, citing the Ta Mei Wan Pao's commentary on the market stagnation, if this situation continues, "Shanghai is likely to face a massive wave of unemployment due to the closure of factories and businesses." Since the Chiang bandits began large-scale inspections of warehouses and storage yards in Shanghai at the end of August, merchants have used various methods to evade them. According to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on the 2nd, "In the past week," Shanghai's economic police (secret agents) have been constantly searching warehouses and inspecting stored goods. Many merchants moved their goods away before the police arrived. When the police arrived, they found that thirty-two warehouses were empty." Although airports, docks, and stations in Shanghai are full of economic secret agents to prevent material flight, the post office parcel department is filled with packages of cotton yarn and cloth about to be shipped out. Flour and rice are also being transported to private residences. Some merchants even "hire mobile vehicles, load them with their goods, and cruise the streets day and night" (Associated Press). At the same time, "Merchants are conducting 'mobile' black market transactions. They move stockpiled goods from one place to another" (Reuters, Shanghai, 7th). Therefore, according to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on the 8th, quoting a merchant, "It is impossible to do business according to the prices stipulated by the order. Now, the business being done at official prices is merely a gesture for the government to see by individual merchants." The agency's reporter pointed out: "The prices of various items are rising endlessly. The economic police's military strides cannot suppress prices." Outside of Shanghai, in Hankou and Chengdu, according to a TASS report from Shanghai on the 7th, citing the Ta Kung Pao, even under violent "control," "prices are still rising. In reality, there are no goods for sale because they have all been hoarded."

　　国民党政府“改革币制”“管制经济”后
  　蒋区市场交易陷于瘫痪
    黑市交易及物资逃避成为普遍现象
    【新华社陕北十六日电】综合各方消息：上月十九日国民党反动政府宣布实施“币制改革”，冻结物价及采用暴力手段“管制经济”后，已使其统治区各地市场正当交易陷于瘫痪，黑市交易及物资逃避，成为普遍现象。举国民党统治区经济中心的上海为例，据路透社十日消息：上海“各业生意几乎全部陷于停顿”。“这部分是由于政府规章将物价冻结而商人却有很大抵抗，部分是由于政府实施严格经济管制”之故。该社记者已要求伦敦总社把上海市场停顿的情况报告英国政府，因为这种情况已“严重的影响我们（英国）的商业”。又据该社同日电讯引大美晚报对市场停顿的评论称：这种情况如果延长下去，“上海很容易会因工厂商行倒闭而面临失业的大浪潮”。自蒋匪于八月底开始大规模检查上海仓库货栈之后，商人即用各式各样的办法来逃避。据美联社上海二日报导：“过去一周中”，上海经济警察（特务）不停地在搜查货栈，检查所藏商品。许多商人都在警察搜查之前，将货物运走。当警察来到时，他们发现三十二所货栈已空空如也”。上海的机场、码头、车站各处虽满布经济特务，防止物资逃避，但在邮局包裹部中却塞满行将运走的棉纱、布匹的包裹。面粉和大米也被运到私人住家去。有的商人甚至“雇一些流动车辆，装上他们的货物昼夜在大街上巡游”（美联社）。与此同时，“商人们正进行‘机动的’黑市交易。他们把囤积的商品由一地移至另一地”（路透社上海七日电）。因此，据美联社上海八日电引一个商人的话说：“按照命令规定的价格做生意是不可能的。现在按照官定价格所做着的生意，只是个别商人做给政府看的姿态。”该社记者指出：“各种物品的价格都在上涨不已。经济警察的军步压低不了物价。”上海以外的汉口、成都两地，据塔斯社上海七日电引大公报的消息称：虽在暴力“管制”之下，“物价仍然上升。实际上没有货物供出售，因为它们都被囤积起来了。”
