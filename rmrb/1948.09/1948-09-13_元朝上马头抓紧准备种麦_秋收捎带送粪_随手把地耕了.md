[Jinan News] Shangmatou District in the Second District of Yuanchao is actively arranging for the autumn harvest and wheat planting, implementing a plan of achieving a bumper harvest, delivering manure while harvesting, plowing while delivering, and preparing for timely planting. In Sanniangniangmiao Village, two-thirds of the manure dug out of the manure pits has already been delivered to the fields. Wang Dianzhong immediately started plowing the stubble after harvesting the sorghum, and then carried manure to the fields. Zhang Peixing's wife participated in harvesting sorghum, while her husband pushed the manure cart and she pulled it, and the manure has now been completely delivered. Currently, the village has plowed 54 mu of early-stubble land from sorghum, millet, etc., and the entire village plans to plant wheat on 65% of its land (the village is not entirely good land). The masses in Shangmatou Village are vying to use carts to deliver manure. Due to a shortage of carts, they have switched to using livestock for two *xiang* at a time. In order to plant more wheat, Qi Yuhai specially bought 100,000 yuan worth of manure from Daming. The village also convened mass meetings by area to discuss and study the wheat planting plan. Zhengzhai Village has now plowed more than 20 mu of early-stubble land. Many women, such as Liu Jinchao's wife, are participating in agricultural labor, helping their husbands chop sorghum, and taking time to cut grass to free up male labor for more intensive work. Huang Jiusi is cutting and plowing the stubble on his three *mu* of millet as he harvests, delivering manure, and then plowing it. In Xinzhuang Village, sorghum is harvested as it ripens. Currently, all villages in the district are generally making wheat planting plans, and planning to apply two to three large cartloads of manure per *mu*, harvesting, applying manure, and plowing in succession, planting according to the season. Every night, the village loudspeakers praise model workers and disseminate experiences, and the masses in each village have very high production enthusiasm. (Dian Qing, Wen Yun, Pei Yin)

　　元朝上马头抓紧准备种麦
  　秋收捎带送粪
  　随手把地耕了
    【冀南讯】元朝二区上马头小区，各村积极布置秋收种麦，实行丰收、随送粪、随耕、准备及时下种。三娘娘庙村从粪坑里扒出来的粪，已送到地里三分之二。王殿忠杀完高粱，立即＠起茬来，又将粪担到地里。张培兴妻参加杀高梁，她丈夫推粪她拉车子，粪现已送完。现该村已犁起来高梁、谷子等五十四亩早茬，全村计划种麦达到百分之六十五（该村不是纯好地）。上马头村群众争着使车送粪，因车缺，已改为两晌使牲口。为了多种麦，齐玉海特从大名买了十万元的大粪。该村又分片召开了群众会，讨论研究作种麦计划。郑寨村现已耕起来早茬地二十余亩。如刘进朝妻等不少妇女，均参加了农业劳动，帮助男人切高粱，并抽时割草，腾出男劳力干整活。黄九思三亩谷子随割随＠起茬来，随送粪，随又犁起来了。辛庄村高粱熟一片杀一片。现全小区各村正普遍作种麦计划，并计划每亩上两大车至三大车粪，随收割、随上粪、随耕起来，按季节种上。每夜各村的广播筒表扬模范，传播经验，各村群众生产情绪很高。（殿卿、文运、培荫）
