[Jinzhong News] Medical workers of a certain unit of the North China People's Liberation Army bravely carried out rescue work during the Jinzhong Campaign. Medical orderly Niu Mingying was rescuing the wounded in the battle of Dongjia Village, Xugou County, when she herself was wounded. Despite this, she insisted on rescuing the wounded, bandaging them well before applying medicine and bandaging herself. Medical orderly Zhang Jinzhong, during the battle to attack Baijiazhuang in Jinyuan County, organized two cooks to rescue the wounded on the front lines. At a distance of fifty meters from the enemy, one cook was wounded, and the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, making it impossible to advance. Zhang Jinzhong was resourceful and immediately consulted with Squad Leader Bai Xiaowu of the small artillery unit, asking him to provide fire support and rescued nine wounded soldiers. Doctor Li Yin carried a machine gun for the soldiers during the march. During the struggle to protect wheat in Xiaoyizhuang'er, he saw four comrades wounded and immediately organized medical orderly Liu Heguang to quickly carry all the wounded down. In this unit, nine medical personnel including Niu Mingying were wounded while rescuing the wounded, and three comrades including Sun Ai'er and Wu Guanzhong gloriously sacrificed themselves while rescuing the wounded. The above comrades were all awarded merits or commendations in the battle evaluation. Under the general objective of "everything for the front, for the safety of the wounded," the medical personnel of this unit not only persisted in their work in close proximity to the enemy (only a hundred meters away from the enemy's bunker when attacking Baijiazhuang) but also were good at overcoming difficulties. When medical equipment was incomplete, ordinary sterilized knives were used as substitutes. When medical cotton and bandages ran out, quilts were taken apart and sheets were torn up, and sterilized to replenish the supply. Under extremely difficult conditions, they stopped bleeding and removed shrapnel for the wounded, thus greatly reducing the mortality rate of the wounded.

　　晋中解放军某部医务人员
  　浴血救护负伤同志
    【晋中讯】华北人民解放军某部医务工作者于晋中战役英勇进行救护工作。卫生员牛明英在徐沟县东贾村战斗中抢救伤员时，自己也负了伤，仍坚持把伤员抢救下来后，给伤员包扎好了，才给自己上药包扎。卫生员张金忠，在攻晋源县白家庄战斗中，曾组织二炊事员往火线抢救伤员，在距敌五十米处，一炊事员负伤，敌炮火很猛，无法前进，张金忠机动灵活，立即与小炮班长白小武等商量，请其以火力协助，抢救了九个伤员。医生李银戮行军中替战士扛机枪，在孝义庄儿上护麦斗争中看到四个同志负了伤，立即组织卫生员刘和光把伤员全部迅速背下来。该部卫生员因抢救伤员而负伤的有牛明英等九人，孙爱儿、武贯忠等三同志因抢救伤员而光荣牺牲。以上诸同志在战评中均分别受到记功或表扬。该部医务人员在“一切为了前线，为了伤员安全”的总目标下，不仅在距敌极近的情况下（攻白家庄时仅距敌碉百十公尺）坚持工作，且善于克服困难。医疗器械不全，即以普通刀子消毒代替，药棉绷带用完了，则拆被子撕被单，经过消毒来补充，他们在非常困难的条件下，为伤员止血取弹片，因而伤员死亡率大为减少。
