Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th: The various units of the Northeast People's Liberation Army front, in the summer military training, due to the hard work and diligent study of the entire army, regardless of the sweltering heat, all commanders and fighters have made great progress in technology and tactics. In terms of technology: the vast majority of soldiers have mastered the skills of blasting. All infantry in a certain unit have learned blasting. In a certain unit, only 3% of the total number of people knew how to blast at the beginning of the training, but now it has reached 98%, of which more than 55% are completely proficient. Shooting and grenade throwing techniques have also greatly improved. In a certain unit, only two soldiers missed the target in shooting practice. A certain unit's rifle shooting average improved by 6 rings, light machine gun shooting average improved by 5 rings, and heavy machine gun shooting improved by 10 rings. The hit rate of a certain unit's grenade throwing improved by 20% compared with the first stage of training, and the average grenade throwing distance of a certain unit improved by more than 5 meters. In terms of tactics: all units, in connection with past combat experience and combined with tactical requirements, carried out lectures and exercises, and launched various "training and evaluation" activities. All commanders and fighters have made significant progress in understanding tactical thinking. Cadres at all levels can generally understand that after receiving a task, they must use their brains, look at the terrain, choose the charging route and breakthrough point, and study how to engage the enemy and charge, as well as the actions at each stage, and what preparations should be made in advance, etc. In addition, everyone also has a deeper understanding of how to flexibly use infantry and firepower in coordination according to the terrain and landforms at the time, combat formations, and tactical principles for independent operations.

    【新华社东北十九日电】东北解放军前线各部，在夏季大练兵中，由于全军不避酷署勤学苦练的结果，全体指战员在技术上和战术上均获得巨大进步。在技术方面：绝大多数战士都掌握了爆炸的技能，某部的步兵全体学会了爆炸，某部在练兵开始时会爆破的只占全人数百分之三，现在已达百分之九十八，其中完全熟练者则在百分之五十五以上。射击和投弹技术也有很大进步，某部在打靶中全体战士只有两个人脱靶，某部步枪射击平均较前进步六环，轻机枪射击平均进步五环，重机枪射击进步十环。某部投弹命中率较练兵第一阶段进步百分之二十，某部投弹平均进步五米多。在战术方面：各部都联系过去实战经验，结合战术要求，进行讲解和演习，并展开了各种“练评”运动，全体指战员在贯通战术思想上都有了显著的进步。各级干部一般的都能领会接受任务后要用脑子，要看地形，选择冲锋开路和突破点，并研究如何接敌冲锋及各阶段的动作，事先要作好那些准备等等。此外对步兵与火器的协同动作如何根据当时的地形地物灵活运用，战斗队形及对独立作战的战术原则等，大家也都有了较深刻的体会。
