Inquiry and Reply

　　To the Editor:

　　In areas where land reform has been thoroughly completed, can we provide loans to landlords and rich peasants if they encounter difficulties in production (such as a lack of necessary farm tools, seeds, and livestock) that they cannot resolve themselves? One opinion is that we can and should provide loans, arguing that: (1) In areas where land reform has been thoroughly completed, the feudal or semi-feudal classes—landlords and rich peasants—have become historical terms. Therefore, the saying "only lend to poor and hired peasants, not to landlords and rich peasants" is no longer valid; (2) Under the directives of "vigorously developing agricultural production" and "organizing the labor of landlords and rich peasants to strive for the common recovery and development of agricultural production," especially for "landlords" who have been deprived of basic means of production in the past, it is appropriate to provide loans to them when they have difficulties in production. Because doing so gives them a way out through labor reform and is beneficial to the development of social production. Another opinion is that loans should not be given, or even if they are given, they should not be treated the same as loans to middle peasants, poor peasants, and hired laborers. The reasons are: (1) Although land reform has been completed, the status of landlords and rich peasants cannot be changed for a while, so they cannot be given loans; (2) No document from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has ever stated that loans can be given to landlords and rich peasants.

　　The above are the main bases for the two opinions. We are still unclear about who is right and who is wrong. Please provide an answer in the newspaper.

　　Answer: In areas where land reform has been thoroughly completed, feudal and semi-feudal exploitation has been eliminated. The future direction is to unite all working people in rural areas and organize the labor of landlords and rich peasants to restore and develop production, first and foremost supporting peasants in production. If the landlords and old-style rich peasants who have been liquidated are unable to carry out production, it is permissible to provide loans to them, as this is beneficial to the development of production. Therefore, treating loans to landlords and old-style rich peasants the same as loans to poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants is incorrect; however, it is also incorrect to believe that no loans can be given at all.

### 土地平分后，地富能否贷款？

专栏：询问与答复

　　土地平分后，地富能否贷款？编辑同志：
    在土地改革业已彻底完成的地区，如地主富农在其进行或发展生产遇有困难（如缺乏必要的农具、种子、牲畜）不能解决时，我们能否贷款给他？一种意见认为可以而且应当贷给，理由是：（一）土改既已彻底完成的地区，作为封建或半封建的阶级——地主富农，已经成了历史上的名词，因此所谓“只贷给贫雇，不贷给地富”的说法不能成立；（二）在“大力发展农业生产”与“组织地富劳动力为共同恢复与发展农业生产而奋斗”的指示下，特别对过去被剥夺了基本生产资料的“地主”，当其进行生产有困难时，贷款给他是应当的。因为这样做是给他以劳动改造的出路，对发展社会生产也有好处。另一种意见认为不能贷给，即使贷给也不能与中农、贫雇农一般看待。理由是：（一）土改虽已完成，但地主富农的成份一时不能改变，因此不能贷给他；（二）中共中央任何文件上没有说过可以贷款给地富。
    上边是两种意见的主要根据，谁是谁非，还弄不清楚，请在报上作一答复。

    答：在土改彻底完成地区，封建半封建剥削，已经消灭，今后的方向是团结农村中一切劳动人民并组织地主富农的劳动力恢复与发展生产，首先是扶助农民进行生产，如果被清算后的地主、旧式富农无法进行生产时，贷款给他是可以的，这样对发展生产是有好处的。因此，给地主、旧式富农贷款与贫雇农、中农一般看待，是不对的；但认为完全不能贷给也是不对的。　　　　　　——编者
