　　How to Lead Spontaneous
  　Small-Scale Mutual Aid Groups
    Zhi Jian
    This year, many areas in Taihang have seen the emergence of several spontaneous small-scale mutual aid groups in agricultural production. For instance, there are 26 such groups in Xihu Village, Wu'an; 28 in Huangguanying Village, Ci County. These mutual aid groups are widespread in the Sixth Administrative Region. Similar groups also exist in Gaoyi in the First Administrative Region, and Huguan in the Third Administrative Region. There are 14 such groups in Wubai Village (village name), Gaoyi, and more than 20 in Cangfang Village. These small-scale production mutual aid groups have various names, such as "Cha Junzi" (meaning sharing livestock for plowing), "Da Boli Huo" (meaning working shifts), and "Boli Gongzu" (meaning shift work group). These groups are mostly formed based on the needs of local agricultural work, with each group consisting of two to three or five to six households. The basis of their association is compatibility and shared sentiments, and some are relatives or brothers. Some involve mutual aid between those with good livestock and those with good labor, while most involve mutual aid between those with more labor and those with less, those with more farm tools and those with fewer, those with livestock and those without, those with skills and those without, and between poor and middle peasants. For example, the "Cha Junzi" between Lao Si and San Hei in Maliu Village, Gaoyi, involves Lao Si, who is a poor peasant and can weave, and San Hei, who is a middle peasant and cannot. The two families have been helping each other for more than ten years. Another example is Lao Dui in Wubai Village, who has twenty mu of land and one laborer, and Wang Zhen, who has thirty mu of land and also one laborer. Wang Zhen has a cart, waterwheel, and a full set of farm tools, as well as a large mule; Lao Dui only has a weak donkey. The two families have been helping each other for more than ten years. These mutual aid arrangements often lack a formal system, a leader, and hold few meetings. Matters are discussed during breaks or while working in the fields. Labor accounting is sometimes done by memory, and sometimes with copper coins. For example, in Lao Xiang's group in Dachun Village, Fifth District, Shahe, each person takes twenty copper coins, and each day is calculated as five "shang" (periods of work). Accounts are settled when a certain time has passed, and whoever has fewer copper coins contributes more labor.
    Most of these mutual aid groups do not welcome the leadership of cadres, and some are even conducted in secret. A district cadre in She County said: "When we go to the village to lead production, we see mutual aid groups in the fields, but when we ask about them in the village, they deny their existence." A district cadre working in Nanzhuang said: "When we see people holding a meeting, they disperse as soon as we approach." The formation of these mutual aid groups is due to the fact that the masses of peasants want to overcome certain difficulties in individual production; on the other hand, it is also because we have had formalistic work styles in production leadership in the past. Some cadres organized mutual aid not through the voluntary participation of the masses, but through forced and rigid arrangements, imposing unrealistic production plans on the masses, forcing them to hold unnecessary meetings, and having those with labor provide uncompensated care for those without, even assigning village chores to the mutual aid groups. As a result, mutual aid did not allow them to do more work. They want to produce, don't want to waste time, don't want to be taken advantage of, and don't want to be constrained. This year, after emphasizing the opposition to commandism and formalism in production leadership, the masses spontaneously organized flexible and convenient small-scale mutual aid groups.
    This fact shows that the masses' demand for organized mutual aid production is very urgent. If we do not conduct thorough investigations and research, and only superficially see that the masses' enthusiasm for the mutual aid organized by our leadership is not high, it would be completely wrong to believe that the masses do not want mutual aid. Our fundamental attitude towards this spontaneous small-scale mutual aid should be affirmative. Since the masses have the freedom to choose their production methods and organizational forms, and this small-scale mutual aid is the form that most of the masses can accept today, it should not be regarded as a feudal combination and opposed or disbanded. On the contrary, it should be cherished and helped, and gradually improved on the existing foundation.
    For the specific leadership of these small-scale mutual aid groups, it is best to first go deep into a few groups, live and work with them (otherwise the peasants will not welcome us), and thoroughly understand its advantages, as well as its disadvantages. For example, mutual aid without labor accounting, unwillingness to express opinions face-to-face, each person having their own small calculations, which over time will lead to resentment and affect unity, the inability to plan and arrange labor-saving methods accurately, the inability to expand the scope, and the flexible mobilization for sideline production, etc. In this way, on the one hand, promote its advantages, such as democracy and fairness; on the other hand, introduce new experiences and methods from other more advanced mutual aid groups, allowing them to choose the parts that are suitable for themselves and can overcome some of their shortcomings, and gradually implement them. But never delay people's production because of "leadership", nor force people to accept this or that new system. It is entirely up to persuasion and the demonstration of good experiences, otherwise the leadership will inevitably fail, and we will be shut out by the masses, and even the mutual aid itself will be kept secret. After gaining experience in one or several groups, summarize it well, then formulate general methods, promote leadership, and widely propose new directions and methods that the masses can accept, to improve and develop more reasonable and beneficial mutual aid.
    While deeply leading, we should widely publicize and educate about the policy of mutual aid—voluntary and equivalent exchange. So that the masses know that this is a definite and unchanging principle. If any cadres want to force the masses to adopt this or that production method, it is illegal. At the same time, conduct extensive and in-depth self-criticism of the past bad work styles in leadership, and conduct extensive and in-depth publicity of the past good examples and practices. Thoroughly examine and solve all the legacy issues under the old work styles in the past, so that the masses believe in our Party's mutual aid policy. Otherwise, spontaneous mutual aid groups will definitely use various methods to reject our leadership, or even collapse again.

　　如何领导群众自发的
  　小型互助组
    志坚
    今年太行不少地区发现群众生产中存在着若干自发的小型互助组，武安西湖村就有二十六个；磁县黄官营村有廿八个；在六专区这种互助组是普遍的。其他在一专区的高邑、三专区的壶关等县均有。高邑五百村（村名）有十四个，仓房村有二十多个。这种小型生产互助组的名称不一，有叫“插犋子”（即牲口插犋）、有叫“打拨活”，也有叫“拨工组”的。这些组多是根据各地农活需要组成，每组二三户至五六户不等。结合的基础都是对心思、合得来，亲戚本家弟兄在一起的也有。一部分是好牲口和好牲口、好劳力对好劳力互助，大多数是劳力多和劳力少、农具多和农具少、有牲口和无牲口、有技术和无技术、贫农和中农的互助。如高邑马留村老四和三黑的“插犋”，老四家是贫农，会织布，三黑家是中农，不会织布。两家在一起互助已经十多年了。又如五百村焦老对有二十亩地，一个劳力，王振有三十亩地也是一个劳力，王振有大车、水车、全套农具，大个骡子一头；老对只喂一个赖驴，两家在一起互助也是十余年了。这种互助多是没制度、没组长、开会少，有事抽空或在地里干活时就商量了。记工有的靠心记，也有用铜钱记的。如沙河五区大村老相组，每人拿二十个铜钱，每天按五晌计算，到一定时候算帐，谁的铜钱少谁就出工。
    这些互助组大部分不欢迎干部领导，也有暗互助的。涉县有的区干部说：“咱去村领导生产，到地里见有互助，回村里问就没有了。”在南庄工作的区干部说：“见人家在开会，咱往跟前一走就散了。”这种互助组的形成，一方面是农民群众为了克服个体生产中若干困难；另方面是过去我们在生产领导上存在着形式主义作风，有的干部组织互助不是通过群众自觉自愿，而是强迫硬编，给群众订不合实际的生产计划，硬叫群众开不必要的会议，有劳力者无代价的照顾没劳力者，甚至把村上一些杂事都叫互助组去做。群众互助起来反倒不能多做活。他们要生产，不愿浪费时间，不愿吃亏，也不愿受拘束。今年强调反对了领导生产中的强迫命令和形式主义之后，群众就自发组织了灵活方便的小型互助组。
    这事实说明群众对组织起来互助生产的要求是很迫切的，如果我们不深入调查研究，只是表象的看到群众对我们领导组织的互助热情不高，就认为群众不要求互助，是完全错误的。我们对待这种自发的小型互助的根本态度应该是肯定的。群众既然有选择生产方式与组织形式的自由，而这种小型互助又是今天大部群众所能接受的形式，那就不能把它看成封建的结合而加以反对和解散。相反，应加以爱护和帮助。并从现有的基础上逐渐把它提高。
    对这些小型互助的具体领导，最好是先深入几个组，和他们生活劳动在一起（否则农民就不欢迎我们），彻底了解一下它的优点，也了解一下它的缺点。比方，互助不记工，有了意见当面不愿说，各人内心有自己的小算盘，久了会挽成疙瘩，影响团结，生产不上善于精确计划和安排省工，不能扩大范围，灵活调动做副业生产等。这样一方面发扬它的优点，如民主、公平等；一方面介绍一些别的较高级互助组的新经验、新办法，让他们选择适合于自己的、能克服自己某些缺点的部分，逐渐实行。但决不能因“领导”而耽误人家生产，也不能强制人家接受这样那样的新制度。完全要靠说服与好经验的示范，否则领导必然失败，被群众把我们关在门外，连互助本身都秘密起来。在一个组几个组取得了经验之后，好好总结一下，然后规定一般的方法，推广领导，普遍提出群众可能接受的新方向，新办法，提高与发展更合理、更有利益的互助。
    与深入领导同时，我们应广泛宣传教育抚助政策——自愿等价。使群众都知道这是确实不变的原则。如果有的干部要强制群众采取这种那种生产方式，那就是不合法的。同时对过去领导中的不良作风进行广泛深入的检讨，对过去好的榜样和做法进行广泛深入的宣传。彻底检查与解决过去一切旧作风下的遗留问题，使群众们都相信我党的互助政策。不如此，自发的互助组就一定会用各种方法拒绝我们领导，甚至再次垮台。
