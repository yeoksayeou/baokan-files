Jizhong Electric News: The Jizhong Women's Federation issued instructions calling on women in various regions to actively participate in the autumn harvest and wheat planting. It pointed out that the central task of women's work in September and October is the autumn harvest and wheat planting. All regions must recognize that organizing the vast number of women for production has special significance in the context of a shortage of male labor. Therefore, all regions must universally call upon and effectively organize the vast number of women to participate in production, making them one of the main forces on the production front. All non-disaster areas and lightly affected areas should organize women for the autumn harvest and wheat planting, participating in harvesting, seed selection, threshing, manure accumulation, manure delivery, plowing, and wheat planting, according to their labor conditions. They should also organize female labor to replace male labor and female labor to replace animal power (other regions with conditions for labor exchange should do the same). At the same time, domestic affairs should be appropriately organized (such as childcare, cooking, needlework, etc.) to free up time for field labor. In disaster areas, in addition to planting wheat in areas where it is possible, the main task is to organize women's sideline production. Women's federations in various regions should, according to local conditions and sideline production habits, deeply organize women to carry out various sideline productions, and cooperate with relevant departments at any time to solve their production difficulties (such as capital, sales, etc.). They should also call on women and children to dig wild vegetables, collect leaves, and practice frugality to prepare for famine. In border areas, women's work is mainly to combine production with the struggle against the enemy, carrying out anti-plunder, anti-arrest, and anti-rape campaigns, providing support to the front lines, and sheltering working personnel. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting period, the main task is to organize the masses to protect the autumn harvest, organize women to participate in the autumn harvest protection struggle, and combine with the armed forces to participate in quick harvesting, quick planting, quick gathering, quick threshing, and quick hiding. Through this year's autumn harvest and wheat planting work, unite the vast number of middle and poor peasant women and all women who oppose enemy and puppet looting and rape, and establish women's organizations according to the situation. Regardless of disaster areas, non-disaster areas, or border areas, attention should be paid to organizing the production of military dependents. Not only should mutual aid in cultivation be organized for military dependents who truly lack labor, but more importantly, military dependents should be organized and educated to engage in production themselves. In the future, in the development of production, these women should be educated to recognize that it is glorious for their children or husbands to go to the front line to kill the enemy, and it is also glorious to work hard in production in the rear. Only through production can they have a good life. In addition, education should be carried out among representatives and male peasants to change their views of disliking trouble and not valuing women's production (especially field production).

　　冀中妇联号召妇女积极参加秋收种麦
    【冀中电】冀中妇联会发出指示，号召各地妇女积极参加收秋种麦。指出：九、十两月的妇女工作，以秋收种麦工作为中心。各地必须认识，在男劳动力缺乏情况下，组织广大妇女生产更有其特殊意义。因此，各地必须普遍号召与切实组织广大妇女参加生产，使之成为生产战线上的主力之一。凡非灾区和轻灾区，都要组织妇女秋收种麦，根据劳动条件参加收割、选种、打场、积肥、送粪、耕地、种麦等工作，并组织女工换男工和女工换畜力（其他地区有条件换工者同此）。同时将家务应适当组织好（如看孩子、做饭、针线活等），挤出时间到田间劳动。在灾区：除能种麦地区进行种麦外，主要是组织妇女副业生产。各地妇会应根据地区情况及副业生产习惯，深入组织妇女开展各种副业生产，随时配合有关部门解决她们生产上的困难（如资本、销路等）。并号召妇女，儿童挖野菜、采树叶、节衣缩食，以备渡荒。在边缘区：妇女工作主要是结合生产进行对敌斗争，开展反掠夺、反抓捕、反奸淫，进行支前，掩护工作人员等。在秋收种麦期间，主要是组织群众护秋，组织妇女参加护秋斗争，和武装结合，参加抢收、抢种、快收、快打、快藏。通过今年秋收种麦工作，团结广大中贫农妇女及一切反敌伪抢掠奸淫的妇女群众，并根据情况建立妇女组织。无论灾区、非灾区、边缘区，都要注意组织军属生产，不仅对确无劳力的军属组织代耕互助，更重要的是组织教育军属自己动手生产。今后在发展生产中要教育这些妇女，认识自己的子弟或丈夫上前线杀敌是光荣的，自己在后方努力生产也是光荣的，只有生产才能过好光景。此外还要向代表会和男农民进行教育，转变他们某些嫌麻烦不重视妇女生产的观点（尤其是田间生产）。
