Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. TASS News: Soviet workers are enthusiastically launching a movement to reduce production costs and increase labor productivity, striving to exceed planned targets and increase socialist capital accumulation. This movement, along with the Soviet peasants' movement to complete and exceed grain delivery plans ahead of schedule, aims for the common goal of completing the Five-Year Plan in four years. Initiated by thirty-five leading factories in Moscow, this movement has spread throughout the Soviet Union at "express speed" (Pravda) and has become a mass movement. Economic leaders' conferences and workers' meetings are being held everywhere in Leningrad, the Urals, and the Donets Basin. Thousands of factories are setting ambitious goals day by day, guaranteeing to reduce costs and increase capital accumulation beyond planned targets. The creativity of workers, engineers, and technicians has been greatly enhanced by this powerful incentive. New inventions and rationalization proposals are being put forward everywhere to improve working methods, increase labor intensity, reduce non-productive expenses, and save raw materials, fuel, and electricity. Moscow industries originally planned to exceed capital accumulation targets by 1 billion rubles, but due to the movement's development, it has now been decided to increase this to 2 billion rubles. They are challenging workers across the country, calling on everyone to do the same. In this movement, the labor productivity of Moscow workers has now exceeded pre-war levels by 45.8 percent. Pravda published an editorial pointing out that "this movement has great significance" because it "will not only enable the state to gain tens of billions of rubles to promote the revival and development of the national economy," but also clearly demonstrates "the superior moral qualities of the Soviet people, their ardent patriotism, and their new spirit as members of a socialist society." Soviet newspapers are prominently publishing letters written to Stalin by workers participating in this movement. For example, textile workers, engineers, technicians, and staff in the Ivanovo Oblast guaranteed in a letter to Stalin that they would save 348 tons of cotton and 136 tons of yarn by the end of this year, thereby producing an additional 3 million meters of fabric. In addition, they guaranteed to reduce production costs by 40 million rubles. When publishing this news, Pravda also published an editorial to commend and encourage them.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. TASS News: The Soviet harvest and grain delivery plans are being successfully completed and exceeded ahead of schedule. As of September 10th, 86 percent of all grains have been harvested. Soviet newspapers have been prominently publishing letters from all collective farms and state farms in various republics, border regions, and states to Stalin, reporting on the completion of grain delivery plans. The Ukrainian Republic, known as the "granary of Europe," completed its grain delivery plan ahead of schedule on September 3rd, one month and seven days earlier than last year, with total grain deliveries exceeding last year by 115 million poods (one pood equals 32.76 jin), exceeding 1940 by 33 million poods. All Ukrainian peasants have guaranteed to deliver at least an additional 31.6 million poods of grain and have challenged the collective farms and state farms in Siberia and the Far East to engage in socialist competition for exceeding grain delivery quotas. The Republics of Belarus and Moldova completed their grain delivery plans ahead of schedule in late August, with total grain deliveries exceeding last year by 34 million poods. All peasants in the two republics also guaranteed to deliver at least an additional 7.5 million poods of grain. In addition, all collective farms in the Moscow Oblast and many other states have completed their grain delivery plans ahead of schedule, with total grain deliveries exceeding not only last year but also 1940. Pravda pointed out in its commentary: "The grain delivery movement vividly demonstrates the political consciousness of the Soviet peasants and the outstanding patriotic enthusiasm of the collective farmers to realize the post-war agricultural recovery and further development plan as soon as possible."

　　苏工人展开减低成本提高生产运动
  　增加社会主义资本积累
    农民争先纳粮力求进一步发展农业
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社讯：苏联工人正热烈展开减低生产成本、提高劳动生产率，以争取超过计划增加社会主义资本积累的运动，与苏联农民提前完成并超过纳粮计划的运动同为争取五年计划四年完成的共同目标而努力。这一运动是由莫斯科三十五家首要工厂发起的，迅即以“特快的速度”（真理报）传遍全苏而成为群众性的运动。列宁格勒、乌拉尔、顿尼兹等地到处都举行了经济领导人员的大会与工人大会，成千的工厂一天多似一天地订出努力目标，保证超计划地减低成本、增加资本积累。工人、工程师、技师的创造性已因这一有力的激励而大大提高。各地提出新发明和合理化的建议，以求改进工作方法，增加劳动强度，减少非生产费用，节省原料、燃料与电力。莫斯科各工业本来预计超过计划资本积累十亿卢布，但由于运动的展开，现已决定增加至二十亿卢布，并向全国工人挑战，号召大家也这样做。在这一运动中莫斯科工人的劳动生产率，现在已超过战前水平百分之四十五点八。真理报特发表社论指出“这一运动具有伟大的意义”，因为它“不仅在于将使国家多得数十亿卢布以促进国民经济的复兴与发展”，还在于它明白显示了“苏维埃人民优越的道德品质，他们热诚的爱国主义，他们作为社会主义社会成员的新精神”。苏联各报均以显著的地位刊载参加这一运动的工人们给斯大林写的信。例如伊凡诺伏州纺织业工人、工程师、技师与职员在给斯大林的信中保证：在今年年底以前节省三百四十八吨棉花与一百三十六吨纱，以此来额外生产三百万公尺的织物，此外并保证减低生产成本四千万卢布。真理报在刊出这一消息时，并撰社论予以表扬与勉励。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社讯：苏联收获与纳粮计划正胜利提前完成并超过中。截至九月十日止，全部谷物已有百分之八十六收割完毕。苏联各报连日均以显著地位刊载各共和国、各边疆、各州全体集体农庄、国营农庄向斯大林报告完成纳粮计划的信件。号称“欧洲谷仓”的乌克兰共和国，已于九月三日先期完成纳粮计划，比去年早一个月又七天，纳粮总额超过去年一亿一千五百万普特（一普特合卅二点七六市斤），超过一九四○年三千三百万普特。乌克兰全体农民已保证至少再额外纳粮三千一百六十万普特，并向西伯利亚与远东的集体农庄与国营农庄提出挑战，进行超额纳粮的社会主义竞赛。白俄罗斯与摩达维亚两共和国，在上月下旬即已先期完成纳粮计划，纳粮总额超过去年三千四百万普特。两共和国全体农民还保证至少额外纳粮七百五十万普特。此外，莫斯科州与其他许多州的全体农庄，均已先期完成纳粮计划，纳粮总额不仅超过去年而且超过一九四○年。真理报特撰论指出：“纳粮运动生动地证明苏维埃农民的政治自觉性，与集体农民大众力求尽速实现战后农业复兴与进一步发展计划的卓越的爱国热忱。”
