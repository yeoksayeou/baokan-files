　　Changchun Stopped at "Half Past Six"
    Interview with Dr. Zhang Dexin, Former Acting President of Changda University, Who Fled to Harbin
    Wang Ping
    This is a story told by Dr. Zhang Dexin, the acting president of National Changchun University who fled from the KMT controlled city:
    In mid-October of last year, the People's Liberation Army attacked the Jilin-Changchun Railway, and the power supply at Xiaofengman was cut off. Changchun experienced a city-wide blackout at 6:30 PM on October 17th—trolleybuses stopped wherever they were, and machines froze in whatever position they were in. In that split second, the whole city lost its heat and light with a collective "ah-ha." To this day, some trolleybuses are still parked on the streets, the machines remain poised for action, and the hands of electric clocks still point to half-past six.

    Mr. Zhang Dexin disguised himself as a businessman and left Changchun on June 3rd this year, arriving in Jilin on June 17th. He only arrived in Harbin two days ago.
    "Ordinary people leave Changchun mostly for livelihood reasons," Mr. Zhang Dexin said. "Sorghum rice has already been sold for 330,000 yuan (Northeast Circulation Notes in the KMT-controlled area) per kilogram, which is equivalent to 3.3 million yuan in inland KMT currency; each kilogram of sorghum rice contains about 30,000 grains, which means it takes 100 yuan of KMT currency to buy a single grain of sorghum. How can ordinary people survive?" Mr. Zhang paused for a moment and said, "But my departure from Changchun was entirely due to political distress."
    I asked him what specific events caused him distress. He said:
    "Take the issue of Changda's relocation, for example. I never expressed a specific opinion, so the Kuomintang threatened me, saying that I was suspected of helping the Communist Party to control the youth. Originally, their logic was: those who advocate relocating the school are Communists, because this can maintain a part of the force to 'make trouble' in the rear, and, the relocation can be used to shake people's hearts; but those who do not advocate relocating the school are also Communists, because this can preserve the school equipment and most of the faculty and students, so that the Communist Party can take over when it enters Changchun. In fact, those who advocate relocating the school and those who oppose relocating the school are all Kuomintang members—the former are the Kuomintang members within the school, and the latter are the local Kuomintang members outside the school. This is truly a case of dogs fighting and biting someone, this is one. Second, the party members in the school (including faculty and students) interfere with school administration, making it impossible to carry out education. Some teachers are selfish and only care for their personal gain. For example, Wang Daogen, a professor at the Agricultural College and also the director of the Department of Agricultural Economics, was a cadre of the North China Puppet Regime's New People's Society before the recovery. He is now a key figure in the Northeast branch of the Youth Party. In early April, seeing that Changchun was 'in danger' and fearing capture, he sought an opportunity to flee, and demanded to borrow three months' salary in advance. When I refused, he actually wanted to resort to violence, so I immediately dismissed him. There were also four staff members who were openly gambling and were fired by me. There was a 'student' named Wu Yonggui who was actually a secret agent. He wore seven or eight gold rings on both hands and carried a pistol to class. Where did his money come from? Some students used the school's subsidized grain to make a fortune. For example, the school bought a large batch of sorghum rice at a price of 2,000 yuan per kilogram. When the price of rice rose to 8,000 yuan per kilogram, these special students used the student union or other names to force the school to sell it to them at the original price. After buying it, they hoarded it. When the price rose to 20,000 yuan per kilogram, they came to the school to negotiate, saying, 'The non-staple food allowance has not been issued yet (the non-staple food allowance from the KMT Ministry of Education is often delayed for a month or two), and the students are making a lot of noise. Let's sell the sorghum rice we have stored to the school as a non-staple food allowance!' With this transaction, they earned 18,000 yuan per kilogram. I discussed this matter with the director of the accounting office, and he said, 'Anyway, it's the same thing. If students sell it to outsiders, it's this price, and if the school buys it from outside, it's also this price.' Whether they colluded with each other to cheat, I don't know."
    "The most ridiculous thing is that after they saw that I was gone, they didn't move the reserved car for my use into the special office for the principal. They said I had a Communist style, and therefore firmly opposed my sitting in the car. In short, if we want to run the school in a good, upright, down-to-earth, and orderly manner, then you are considered to have 'ideological problems,' you are a Communist; the more chaotic, corrupt, and degenerate you are, the more 'ideologically correct' you are, and the more you are a loyal believer of the Kuomintang!"

　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　×
    We talked about Zheng Dongguo, the highest military commander of the Kuomintang in Changchun.
    He is a person full of pessimism. Once, someone asked him what his opinion was on the relocation of Changda University. He smiled bitterly and said:
    "If I were the principal of Changda University, I would not advocate moving. If Changchun is lost, can Beiping still be defended? In China, no place is safe. To be safe, we can only move to the United States!"
    When the Kuomintang newspapers spread rumors, saying that the Shenyang "National Army" was "attacking" north and had already reached a certain place; or that the new army trained in Taiwan had arrived in the Northeast and landed in Huludao, Mr. Zhang Dexin asked Zheng Dongguo if there was such a thing. He kept shaking his head, waving his hands, and smiling bitterly.
    Once, several news reporters asked him:
    "The Communist Party compares Changchun to a large prison. What do you think?"
    He answered quite bluntly:
    "That's right! I am the warden!"
    Now, this warden is preparing to become a prisoner, because land transportation has long been cut off. After the People's Liberation Army captured Dafangshen Airport in May, planes could no longer land, and all supplies and ammunition had to be dropped from the air. This is exactly in line with a common saying: "There is no way to go to heaven, and no way to enter the earth." Let's see where this warden and his big and small jailers will flee.

  　×　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    We also talked about the lives and desires of the general people in Changchun, which are very simple: life is about surviving, and the desire is for liberation. The food situation was mentioned above, and the housing situation is also very desolate: many buildings have been demolished by the Kuomintang army, some buildings are not inhabited, so the upper floors are demolished; some are inhabited on one side and the other side is demolished. The wood that is torn down replaces coal and firewood. Some people collect wooden items to sell as firewood, selling them cheaper than firewood, the reason being that firewood is easier to split and ignite, while wooden items are difficult to split and ignite.
    "Merchants and people have heard about the industrial and commercial policies of the liberated areas, and they also know that Harbin and Jilin are becoming increasingly prosperous. They are hiding their goods, hoping to do business after liberation."
    This reminds me of the story he told at the beginning: the trolleybus stopped in its original place waiting for electricity, the machine stopped in its original position waiting for electricity. As soon as the Eighth Route Army arrives, the electricity will arrive, the trolleybus will move, the machine will move, the goods will be taken out, and the market will recover.
    Until Mr. Zhang left Changchun, the hands of the electric clock still pointed to half-past six, but people had already forgotten whether it was 6:30 PM or 6:30 AM—this "half-past six" has two meanings: from the Kuomintang's point of view, it is 6:30 PM, close to dusk, but when the people achieve their desire—liberation, it is 6:30 AM, and the sun has just come out.

　　长春停在“六点半钟”
    逃到哈尔滨的前长大代理校长张德馨博士访问说
    王坪
    这是国民党长春大学代理校长张德馨博士讲的一个故事：
    去年十月中旬，解放军进攻吉长路，小丰满的电源被截断了，长春在十月十七日下午六点半钟全城停电——电车走到哪里便停在那里，机器转在什么姿势便停在什么姿势上。就在那一秒钟的时间里，全城一声“啊嗬”便失去了热力，失去了光明。直到今天，有的电车还停在街上，机器还保持着待动的姿势，电钟的时针还指着六点半。
　　×　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    张德馨先生是今年六月三号化装成商人离开长春的，六月十七日到了吉林，前两天才到哈尔滨。
    “普通老百姓离开长春多是为了生活”，张德馨先生说：“高粱米已经卖到三十三万元（蒋管区东北流通券）一斤了，合关内蒋币三百三十万元；每斤高粱米约三万颗米粒，就是说：要一百元蒋币才能买到一颗高粱米粒，普通老百姓怎么活得下去呢？”张先生稍停顿一会说：“但我的离开长春，完全为了政治上的苦闷。”
    我问他有哪些具体事情使他苦闷呢？他说：
    “比方长大的迁校问题吧，我一直没有表示具体意见。国民党便恐吓我，说我有替共产党把握青年的嫌疑。原来，他们的逻辑是：主张迁校的人是共产党，因为这样可以保持一部分实力到后方‘捣乱’，而且，利用迁校可以动摇人心；但是，不主张迁校的人也是共产党，因为这可把学校器材与大部分教职员学生保留下来，以便共产党进长春时好接收。其实呢，主张迁校与反对迁校的都是国民党——前者是校内的国民党，后者是校外的地方的国民党。这真是狗打架把人咬一口，这是一。第二、校中的党团分子（有教职员、也有学生）干扰校政，无法进行教育。有的教员自私自利，比方农学院教授兼农业经济系主任王道根，光复前为华北敌伪新民会的干事，现为青年党东北要角，四月初旬看到长春‘危险’恐怕被俘、弄到机会想要飞走，强要预借三个月的薪金，被我拒绝，竟要动武，结果被我立即解聘，还有四个职员公开赌博，被我开除。有一个叫吴永贵的“学生”其实就是特务，他两只手上戴了七八只金戒指，腰里带着手枪去上课。他的钱哪儿来的呢？有些学生就利用学校的平价粮来发财，比方说，学校用二千元一斤的价钱买进了大批的高粱米，当米涨到八千元一斤时，这些特种学生便利用自治会或其他名义，硬要学校照原价卖给他们，他们买去后，便囤积起来，等涨到两万元一斤时，他们又来同学校交涉说：‘副食费还没有发下来（国民党教育部的副食费常常要拖一两个月才发下来的），同学们又吵又闹。我们把存的高粱米卖给学校作为副食费吧！’这样一倒动，他们便每斤赚了一万八千元。我为这事与会计室主任商量，他说：‘反正是一样，学生卖给外人，是这个价，学校从外面买，也是这样价钱。’其实他们是否狼狈为奸，通同作弊，我就不知道了。”
    “最可笑的是他们见我走了，留用的小汽车，又不搬进校长特备的办公室里面，说我有八路作风，由于说坐汽车的原因，因此坚决反对我。总之我们要好正派的踏踏实实规规矩矩的办学校，你就是‘思想有问题’，你就是共产党；你越是乱七八糟，贪污腐化，那才是‘思想正确’，才是国民党的忠实信徒！”
　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　×
    我们谈到长春国民党最高军事负责人的郑洞国。
    这是一个充满了悲观情绪的人，有一次有人问他对长大迁校有何意见。他苦笑着说：
    “如果我是长大的校长，我是不主张搬的。长春丢了北平难道还能保吗？在中国，没一个地方是安全的，要保险，只有迁到美国去！”
    当国民党的报纸大放谣言，说沈阳“国军”向北“进攻”，业已抵达某地；或者说：台湾训练的新军已开抵东北，已在葫芦岛登陆云云。张德馨先生去问郑洞国有没有这样的事，他不断地摇头，不断的摆手，还不断地苦笑。
    有一次几个新闻记者问他：
    “共产党把长春比成一个大监狱，你有什么意见？”
    他回答得颇为干脆：
    “对啦！我就是监狱长！”
    如今，这位监狱长正准备当俘虏，因为陆上交通早已断绝，当解放军五月攻占大房身飞机场后，飞机也不能落地了，所有的给养弹药只好凭空抛下。这正符合一句俗语：“上天无路，入地无门”，看这位监狱长及其以下的大大小小的狱卒往何处逃命。
  　×　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    我们还谈到长春一般人民的生活与愿望，说起来也很简单：生活就是捱命，愿望就是解放。吃的情形上面提到了，住的情形也很凄凉：很多楼房被国民党军队拆了，有的楼不住着人，楼上便拆光；有的是这边住着人那边便拆光。拆下来的木料便代替了煤，代替了柴，有人收木器当劈柴卖，卖价比木柴便宜，理由是木柴易劈易着，木器则是难劈难着。
    “商民听说了解放区的工商业政策，也知道哈尔滨、吉林正日趋繁荣，他们都把货物藏起来，希望解放后好做买卖。”
    这使我想起他开头讲的那个故事：电车停在原来的地方等电，机器停在原来的姿势上等电，八路军一到，电就到了，电车也动了，机器也动了，货物也拿出来了，市面就复苏了。
    直到张先生离开长春时，电钟的时针还指着六点半，但人们已经忘记了是下午六点半呢，还是上午六点半——这“六点半”是有两个意味的：在国民党方面说，是下午六点半，已经近黄昏的时候，但，人民一旦达到了他们的愿望——解放时，那便是上午六点半，太阳刚好出来了。
