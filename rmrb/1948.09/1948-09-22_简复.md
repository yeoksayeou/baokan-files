To Liu Chengjun, West Street, Xingtang:
    Regarding the pharmacy in your street occupying the house of a fleeing household, now that the fleeing household has returned, the property rights should revert to the original owner. As for the pharmacy's expenses for repairing the house, the landlord should bear them. Specific solutions can be discussed by the street government in coordination with both parties.

To Li Hexiang, Gaoyang:
    Regarding the matter mentioned in your letter about a certain woman who engaged in illegal activities marrying a cadre in Shijiazhuang in an attempt to evade legal sanctions, please provide detailed information. We will send a letter to the relevant authorities to resolve the matter.

To Han Silu, Fourth District, Boping:
    It is true that your family, being middle peasants, were wrongly struggled against. You should receive appropriate compensation. As for the farmer from Boping who rode a donkey home with you, and the donkey was confiscated by your village, it should naturally be returned to its original owner.

To Wang Yongze, Southern Hebei:
    The liquidation of your sauce garden by the shop assistants in Hejin Town, Wu'an, followed by three changes of ownership, is a complex matter. We have forwarded it to the Wu'an County Party Committee for investigation and handling.

To Hu Zhaojun:
    The materials concerning the damage done to middle peasants by village cadres in the Fifth Jia Village District of Huolu County have been forwarded to the Fourth Committee of the Northern Yue Region for investigation and handling.

To An Changshu, Tenth District, Xingtai:
    It is right for you to teach according to educational principles and treat all students equally. You should persevere. It is inevitable that some individuals will be dissatisfied, but do not let this affect your work morale. As your letter lacks detail, we cannot provide specific answers.
