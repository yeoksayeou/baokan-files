　　Our Army Liberates Jinan
　　Annihilating All Enemy Troops
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Front, urgent telegram, 18:00 on the 24th] The People's Liberation Army completely liberated Jinan at 5:00 PM today. All defending enemy troops were annihilated, with none escaping. The results of the battle are currently being tallied.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Front, 24th] The People's Liberation Army, attacking Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, has completely occupied the Jinan commercial port and the entire outer city, and is currently engaged in the final stage of street fighting in the inner city. As of the morning of the 23rd, the total number of enemy troops annihilated and those who revolted had reached over 60,000. The Liberation Army began its offensive on the night of the 16th. After several days and nights of fierce fighting, it broke through three lines of heavily fortified defense zones on a broad front spanning over a hundred li in all directions, successively capturing Qihe, Changqing, Wang Sherenzhuang, Zhangxia, Yide, Gushan, Zhonggong and other satellite strongholds of Jinan. On the afternoon of the 19th, when the Liberation Army attacked the commercial port and the suburbs, General Wu Huawen, commander of the Kuomintang 96th Army and concurrently commander of the 84th Division, immediately led the entire 84th Division and the Independent Brigade of the 96th Army in revolt, joining the People's Liberation Army. This unit has now been transferred to the rear of the liberated area. The Liberation Army occupied the airport west of the commercial port at 8:00 PM on the 19th. It launched an offensive against the commercial port on the night of the 20th, and completely occupied the commercial port by dusk on the 22nd. Immediately afterwards, it launched an attack on the city, capturing most of the outer city that night, and completely occupying the outer city by noon on the 23rd. On the night of the 23rd, it launched another attack on the inner city and had already entered. Due to the overwhelming superiority and rapid victory of the Liberation Army, and because Chiang Kai-shek's so-called reinforcements were still far away in Xuzhou and Bengbu at this time, any resistance from the remnants of Wang Yaowu's troops in Jinan's inner city was clearly meaningless.

### 我军解放济南　全部歼灭守敌

　　我军解放济南
  　全部歼灭守敌
    【新华社济南前线二十四日十八时急电】人民解放军今日下午五时全部解放济南，守敌全部歼灭，无一漏网，战果正清查中。
    【新华社济南前线二十四日电】进攻山东省会济南的人民解放军，已经完全占领济南商埠及外城全部，并正在内城进行最后阶段的巷战。守敌就歼及起义总数截至二十三日晨止已达六万余人。解放军于十六日夜开始进攻，经数昼夜激战，在南北东西各百余里的广阔战线上，突破敌三道坚固设防地带，连克齐河、长清、王舍人庄、张夏、义德、崮山、中宫卉济南卫星据点。十九日下午，当解放军攻击商埠及城郊时，国民党第九十六军军长兼整八十四师师长吴化文将军即率领整八十四师全部及九十六军独立旅起义，参加人民解放军；该部现已开赴解放区后方。解放军于十九日晚八时占领商埠以西的飞机场。二十日晚向商埠进攻，至二十二日黄昏将商埠完全占领。继即发起攻城，当夜攻占外城大部，至二十三日午即完全占领外城。二十三日夜又发起攻击内城，并已攻入。由于解放军的压倒优势和神速胜利，由于蒋介石的所谓援军直至此时尚远在徐州、蚌埠，济南内城王耀武所率残部的一切抵抗显已毫无意义。（附图片）
