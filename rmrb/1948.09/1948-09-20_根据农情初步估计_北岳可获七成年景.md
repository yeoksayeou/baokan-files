North Yue Region Expected to Achieve 70% of a Normal Harvest, According to Preliminary Agricultural Assessment.

[North Yue Electric Dispatch] The North Yue Administrative Office recently conducted preliminary assessments of the overall annual harvest based on survey materials from various regions. Using the average normal yield since the Anti-Japanese War as a benchmark, the following is projected: First Special District (Guangling, Lingqiu, Fanshi, Yingxian, Yanggao, Datong, Hunyuan) 80%, Third Special District (Liangshui, Fangshan, Laizhuo, Wanping, Liangxiang, Changwan, Huailai) 70%, Fourth Special District (Lingshou, Pingshan, Fuping, Quyang, Xingtang, Zhengding, Jianping, Jingxing, Huolu) 60%, Fifth Special District (Tangxian, Wanxian, Wangdu, Mancheng, Yixian, Xushui, Dingyu, Laiyuan) 70%, Sixth Special District (Zhuolu, Yuxian, Xuanhua, Tianzhen, Yangyuan, Hairen) 80%. Crops in unaffected areas across the region are growing reasonably well. Therefore, the overall estimated harvest for the region is 70% of normal. The basis for this estimate is as follows:

At the start of the spring plowing season, rainfall was well-distributed, and war mobilization had little impact on production. These factors laid a favorable foundation for this year's harvest. However, very little land was plowed last autumn, and fertilizer accumulation was less than half of the normal amount. Furthermore, since summer, localized droughts, hail, wind, floods, and insect infestations have occurred successively, all having some impact on the harvest.

Drought: After rainfall in early June, most areas (the Sixth Special District had some rain, and other special districts had scattered showers) did not receive rain for more than forty days until July 20th. Water levels in rivers within the region dropped, and canal water volume was insufficient. In some parts of the Fourth Special District, even wells dried up. The average wheat yield was only seven or eight *shi* per *mu* (normal yield is about one *shi*). In Pingshan and Jingxing, more than two-thirds of the seedlings along the road dried up due to drought. In Hongzidian, Jianping County, leaves fell off the trees due to drought. In the Seventh District of Lingqiu, 5,431 *mu* of peas dried up. Seedlings in sandy soil in the Third Special District also showed signs of drying up. It is estimated that losses due to drought will be between 10% and 20%, with the Fourth Special District being the most severely affected.

Hail: Around June, the First Special District suffered three hailstorms. Affected villages were scattered across the counties of the entire district. Incomplete statistics from Datong, Hunyuan, Lingqiu, and Guangling alone show that the affected area reached 25,600 *mu*. In the Third Special District, statistics from only two villages in the Second District of Huailai show that more than seven *qing* of seedlings were destroyed. Eleven percent of the administrative villages in the Fourth Special District were affected, with Xingtang being the most severely impacted. Hailstones were as large as human heads or as small as fists. It is estimated that production in affected areas of the entire district will be reduced by 20%, with some villages in Xingtang and Zhengding experiencing reductions of 40% to 50%. In the Fifth Special District, hail damage was relatively light in Mancheng. Wangdu experienced a reduction in wheat production of about one-third due to hail. The remaining counties each experienced a reduction in yield of 20% to 30% in the affected villages, with some villages experiencing as much as 40% to 50% reduction. In the Sixth Special District, 214,400 *mu* were affected in Yuxian, Zhuolu, Xuanhua, Tianzhen, and Yangyuan, resulting in a production decrease of more than 10%.

Wind: On June 30th, sixteen villages in the Fourth District of Wanping, and parts of the Second, Sixth, and Seventh Districts, thirteen villages in the Fourth District of Fanshi and the Sixth District of Hunyuan were hit by windstorms. On June 20th, the Sixth and Seventh Districts of Laishui and the Fifth District of Liangxiang, and on May 6th, the Sixth District of Wanxian also experienced windstorms. In the sixteen villages of the Fourth District of Wanping alone, 2,982 *mu* of corn and 1,240 *mu* of millet were damaged, along with 10 *mu* of special crops. In the Fourth District of Laishui, 1,528 *mu* of corn and 742 *mu* of millet were damaged. In Fanshi, half of the fruit trees on the mountains were blown down, and between 20% and 60% of special crops were destroyed. More than half of the pears and peaches in western Pingxi, and the apples and pears in Yixian, were blown down.

Flood: From July 19th to 22nd, continuous rain fell for four days and four nights, causing flooding in the Fourth Special District and parts of other special districts. According to statistics, in Xingtang, Fourth Special District, more than 25,000 *mu* of land were washed away or buried by sand, more than 22,000 houses collapsed, more than 11,000 pieces of farm equipment were damaged, and 382 head of livestock were killed or injured (mostly pigs). In Fuping, 5,959 *mu* of paddy fields, 464 *mu* of dry land, and 1,250 *mu* of bottomland were destroyed, along with 26,491 trees. Eight hundred and five houses collapsed. In Pingshan, the banks of the Tuo River eroded sixteen *qing* of land, and water accumulated to a depth of one to three feet in low-lying areas along the river, which had not receded by the 25th. In Jianping, ten thousand *mu* of terraced fields and thirteen thousand *mu* of bottomland were washed away. In Lingshou, nine *qing* of land were washed away. In Dongwanglou, Pingshan, black spots appeared on the stems and leaves of cotton plants after the rain, and more than one *qing* died after being exposed to the sun (the cause is still unclear). In total, 193,849 *mu* of crops were washed away, buried by sand, or drowned throughout the region, accounting for nearly 1% of the region's total cultivated land area. By special district, the Fourth Special District accounted for slightly more than 2.5% of the district's total cultivated land area, the First Special District 2.7%, and the Sixth Special District (Yuxian and Zhuolu) 3.4% of the two counties' total cultivated land area.

Insect Infestation: Since the beginning of spring, various insect infestations have occurred successively, with different crops affected at different times. Although leaders at all levels have paid close attention to eradicating insect pests, some areas have experienced reduced yields due to inadequate organization, late detection, limited technical conditions, and superstitious beliefs among the masses. For example, the jujube weevil was not effectively controlled in Fuping, Quyang, and Xingtang, and the drought during the flowering season further reduced the yield. It is estimated that the total jujube production in the region will be reduced by one-third compared to normal years, with Xingtang being even worse. Armyworms have occurred successively in Yixian, Mancheng, Xushui, Tangxian, and Wanxian in the Fifth Special District; the first and eighth districts of Lingqiu, the second, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts of Fanshi in the First Special District; fifteen villages including Dawangcheng in Yuxian in the Sixth Special District; and the first and fourth districts of Jingxing in the Fourth Special District. In Chuanfang in the first district of Pingshan, Zhufang in the second district, and Zhuhao in the sixth district, oil shortages have occurred successively in the bottomlands, with the area affected by oil leaks in Zhuyongfang and Zhufang reaching six to seven *qing*. Woodborer damage is very serious in the border areas of Huailai, affecting income by 70% to 80%.

　　根据农情初步估计
  　北岳可获七成年景
    【北岳电】北岳行署顷根据各地调查材料，对全一年成作出初步估计。以抗战以来的一般常年产量为标准，预计一专区（广灵、灵邱、繁峙、应县、阳高、大同、浑源）八成，三专区（良水、房山、涞涿、宛平、良乡、昌宛、怀来）七成，四专区（灵寿、平山、阜平、曲阳、行唐、正定、建屏、井陉、获鹿）六成，五专区（唐县、完县、望都、满城、易县、徐水、定与、涞源）七成，六专区（涿鹿、蔚县、宣化、天镇、阳原、怀仁）八成。全区未被灾地区庄稼长的还不坏。因此全区总的估计为七成年景。估计的根据如下：
    春耕开始时，雨水调匀，战争动员对生产也影响不大，这是奠定今年收成的有利方面。但去秋耕地极少，积肥不及常年的半数，又加入夏以来局部地区旱、雹、风、水、虫灾相继发生，故对收成均有或多或少的影响。
    旱灾：自六月初落雨后，直到七月二十日的四十多天中，大部地区（六专区曾落过，其他专区亦零星落雨）没有下雨，境内河水低落，渠道水量不足，四专区有的地方甚至井水枯干，小麦一般收成每亩仅七、八市斗多（常年产量一石左右）。平山、井陉沿路禾苗有旱死三分之二以上的，建屏洪子店树叶有旱落了的，灵邱七区旱死豌豆五千四百三十一亩，三专区沙地庄稼苗也有枯死现象。估计因旱减收要在一成至二成，以四专区为最严重。
    雹灾：六月份前后，一专遭受三次雹灾，灾区遍及全专各县，受灾村庄占全专行政村的百分之十二，受灾面积仅大同、浑源、灵邱、广灵四县不完全统计，即达二五六零零亩。三专仅怀来二区两个村统计，被毁禾苗即达七顷以上。四专有百分之十一的行政村受灾，尤以行唐最为严重，雹大如人头，小如拳头，全专区被灾地区估计减产占二成，行唐正定部分村庄有减产四成至五成者。五专除满城雹灾较轻，望都因雹灾小麦减产约三分之一，其余各县灾村均减产二三成，少数村庄竟达四五成。六专蔚、涿、宣、天镇、阳原等五县二一四四零零亩受灾，减产十分之一以上。
    风灾：六月三十日，浑源六区，繁峙四区十三村，二、六、七区一部，宛平四区十六村刮风成灾，六月二十日涞水六、七区，良乡五区及五月六日完县六区亦相继发生风灾。仅宛平四区十六村玉茭刮坏二九八二亩，谷一二四○亩，特种作物十亩。涞水四区刮坏玉茭一五二八亩，谷七四二亩。繁峙山上果木刮掉半数，特种作物折毁百分之二三十到六十不等。平西梨、桃，易县苹果、梨等刮掉半数以上。
    水灾：七月十九日至二十二日，阴雨连绵四天四夜，四专及他专区部分村庄均遭水灾。据统计四专行唐冲毁、沙压土地两万五千多亩，倒塌房屋两万二千多间，砸农具一万一千多件，死伤牲畜三百八十二头（猪占多数）。阜平毁水地五九五九亩，旱地四六四亩，滩地一二五○亩，树木二六四九一棵，倒房屋八○五间。平山的沱河岸冲地十六顷，沿河洼地停水一尺至三尺，至二十五日尚未撤尽。建屏冲梯田万亩，滩地一万三千亩。灵寿冲地九顷，平山东望楼雨后棉茎叶上起黑色斑点，日晒后枯死顷余（原因仍未弄清）。总计全区冲毁、砂压、涝死庄稼共计一九三八四九亩，占全区总耕地面积近百分之一。按专区说，四专占全专总耕地面积百分之二点五强，一专百分之二点七，六专蔚、涿两县被毁土地占该两县总耕地面积百分之三点四。
    虫灾：入春以来，随着季节的推移，各种作物的不同虫灾相继发生。各级领导在扑灭虫害上虽都高度注意，但有些地方由于具体的组织工作没有赶上，有些地方发现较晚，加以技术条件限制及群众迷信思想等仍将减收。如阜平、曲阳、行唐等地的枣步曲没有打好，开花时又遇天旱，估计全区枣的产量将较常年减少三分之一，行唐更加差。五专易、满、徐、唐、完，一专灵邱一、八区、繁峙二、五、六、七区，六专蔚县大王城等十五个村，四专井陉一、四区，均先后发生黏虫。平山一区川坊，二区朱坊，六区朱毫等滩地相继发生油缺，朱用坊、朱坊二村油龙面积即有六七顷之多。怀来边缘地区的木被虫害十分严重，影响收入十分之七八。
