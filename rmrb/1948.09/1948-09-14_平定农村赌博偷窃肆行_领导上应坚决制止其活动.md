　　Pingding Rural Areas
  　Gambling and Theft Rampant
  　Leadership Should Resolutely Stop These Activities
    In the past six months, many villages in Pingding have seen gambling, theft, shamanistic activities, and even the construction of temples and the sculpting of idols. Recently, during our visit to the countryside, we heard that the above phenomena have become even more serious, especially gambling, which is developing universally. In Shajing, people gather to gamble and even organize lookouts. It is said that the gamblers are also preparing wooden and stone weapons, and if a few cadres try to catch them, they will resist with force. Wei Liancheng of Dongzhuangtou Village used a loan of 50,000 yuan for gambling. The temple construction and idol sculpting in Ciciyao Village of the county were later forced to stop due to difficulties in raising funds.
    Theft has also occurred in many areas. Yang Sanmao of Dongzhuangtou Village had a total of four dou of wheat harvested this year, all of which were stolen. Hu Jilian, Hu Jinniu, and Guo Hucheng of Jiaokou Village are all young and strong men, but they do not cultivate their own land. Instead, they hire others to cultivate half of it. The three of them form a small group and wander around all day, eating and gambling heavily. When they have no money, they find ways to steal. Once, they stole someone else's donkey and were discovered and fled. Hu Jicheng broke his leg while stealing and was caught by the masses. According to Hu Jicheng's own confession, he stole a total of six dou of millet and corn from poor peasant Hu Ming, two dou of grain from Hu Yuanxiao, and a donkey from middle peasant Hu Zhengliang, all of which were squandered. The stolen donkey was sold in Yangquan for 160,000 yuan and completely lost in gambling. In April of this year, two middle peasant households and two poor peasant households lost more than one shi of wheat in total.
    In addition, the old operas performed in Mukou and Luomianzui, the welcoming of gods and temple fairs in Lijiazhuang, and the praying for rain in many villages such as Heizhang and Yangpo in mid-July are not good. Moreover, when Haojiazhuang performed the old opera, the district cadres went to explain and stop it, but were beaten by a group of hoodlums (the perpetrators have been detained by the government). This fully demonstrates a state of anarchy, lack of leadership, and extreme democracy. Although the county's democratic government has issued several announcements to stop these activities, they have not been earnestly implemented in the villages, and those rogue ruffians are still extremely rampant. (Editor's note: Thugs and troublemakers should be punished. Performing old operas and welcoming gods and temple fairs are not good, and the masses should be persuaded through education, but forced prohibition should never be adopted.)
    Why does this phenomenon occur in some old areas of Pingding County? (1) Leftist deviations during the land reform. (2) Tailism in leadership during the land reform period. (3) Many new cadres lack work experience and are afraid to deal with problems boldly. Under the above conditions, bad people take the opportunity to act and attempt to disrupt the revolutionary social order.
    It is hoped that the Pingding County Government will immediately conduct a good inspection and make appropriate corrections. The backward peasants who follow suit should be enlightened and educated to raise their awareness and not follow bad people, as this will not benefit them. The government should resolutely stop the activities of those who are willing to be bare-handed rogues, do not work, do not engage in proper business, and ruin their families and properties after repeated education, and should force them to participate in labor and impose necessary punishments. Otherwise, it will have a great impact on the future social order, the production of the masses, and the overcoming of famine. (Pei Sheng)

### 平定农村赌博偷窃肆行　领导上应坚决制止其活动

　　平定农村
  　赌博偷窃肆行
  　领导上应坚决制止其活动
    近半年来，平定有不少村庄发现有赌博、偷窃、闹神婆，还有的修庙塑神像等现象。最近我们下乡，听到以上的现象发展的更严重了，特别是赌博，普遍的在发展着。沙井聚众赌博，还组织放哨的，据说赌徒们还准备着木石武器，倘有少数干部去捕捉时，就要以武力拒抗。东庄头村的魏连城，将贷款五万元用来耍钱。该县烧磁瑶村的修庙、塑神像，后来因凑款困难而被迫停工了。
    还有不少地区发生偷窃现象，东庄头杨三猫，今年共收下四斗麦子，全部被偷走了。交口村胡计连、胡金牛、郭虎成都是青壮年，家里的土地自己不种，雇上别人半种着，他三人结着个小团体终日漂流浪荡，大吃大赌，没有钱时就想法偷。有一次又偷人家的驴被发觉后逃跑了，胡计成因偷东西跌伤腿，被群众抓住了，据胡计成自己承认的，计有：偷本村贫农胡明小米和玉茭共六斗，偷胡元小的粮食二斗，偷中农胡正良的一头驴，这些都胡花乱用了，偷的驴在阳泉卖了一十六万元，完全赌博输光了。今年四月还有两户中农、两户贫农共失掉麦子一石多。
    另外，木口、罗面咀的演旧剧、理家庄迎神赛会，七月中旬，黑掌、阳坡等好多村子祈雨，都是不很好的，而且郝家庄演旧剧时，区干部去解释阻止，被一伙地痞分子打伤了（凶手已被政府扣押），这十足的表现了无政府、无领导的、极端民主的状态。该县民主政府虽然数次颁发布告制止，但在各村里都没有认真的去执行，而那些流氓地痞无赖之徒仍然极为猖狂。（编者按：流氓地痞捣蛋，应当处分。演旧戏迎神赛会不好，应向群众进行说服教育，但决不能采取强迫制止办法。）
    为什么在平定县一部分老区，还会发生这种现象呢？（一）土改中左倾偏向。（二）在土改时期领导上的尾巴主义。（三）很多新干部，缺乏工作经验，不敢大胆的处理问题。在上述条件下，坏人才乘机活动起来，企图把革命的社会秩序搅乱。
    希望平定县政府，立即很好的进行检查，并适当的予以纠正。对随着跑的落后农民，应进行启发教育，提高他们的觉悟，不要再随着坏人跑，这样对他们没有好处的。对那些甘做徒手流氓、不劳动、不务正业、荡家败产屡次教育不改的分子，政府应坚决制止他们活动，应强制他们参加劳动，并进行必要的处分。否则，对今后社会秩序，群众的生产和渡荒上，都会有很大的影响。　　（佩胜）
