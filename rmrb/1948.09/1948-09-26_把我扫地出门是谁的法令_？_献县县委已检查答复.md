　　"By Whose Decree Was I Swept Out the Door?"
  　Xian County Party Committee Has Investigated and Replied
    Editor's Note: It is very good that the Xian County Party Committee has earnestly examined and corrected errors in its work, and promptly investigated and replied to the opinions of the Party newspaper. This is the attitude that every Communist Party member should have towards the Party newspaper. Responsible comrades in various localities and departments should adopt this attitude when criticized or censured by the Party newspaper on a certain issue; otherwise, it is a lack of organization and discipline, which is not permissible. Comrade Sun Zhen failed to conduct thorough investigations in the village when writing on behalf of someone, resulting in an incomplete reflection of the problem, and some individual places were even erroneous. This should alert future ghostwriters to pay attention to conducting calm, multi-faceted analyses and, if possible, actual investigations to avoid one-sided exaggeration. In addition, Li Shuwen's attitude upon returning to the village after receiving education from the People's Army is not permissible and should be thoroughly reviewed and corrected, and he should obey the leadership of the government.

    To the editors and reader comrades:
    The following is a reply regarding the articles "By Whose Decree Was I Swept Out the Door?" published in People's Daily No. 46 and "Where Was the Mistake?" published in No. 68:

    In our county, in some villages, there are indeed very serious instances of compulsory orders violating Party policies during conscription. Our county welcomes the criticism raised in the newspaper and has made a deep examination and correction. According to the situation in Monan, the "parading through the streets" and "sealing the door" were both facts at the time. After this serious error occurred, the county party committee also severely criticized the district and village cadres and set a deadline for the immediate return of the original items and the unsealing of the door. The main reason for this serious situation was that Li Xuezhong (real name Li Shujun) had embezzled 140 catties of village public grain to buy land and seized five mu of school land, used village timber to build houses, etc., when he was the village chief in the past. At the same time, his work style was very bad. His family was originally poor peasants, but in recent years they have successively divided up eleven mu of land, increasing from eight mu to nineteen mu, and both brothers at home have married wives. His younger brother returned from the army and did not go back, and people said that his family had forgotten their roots. He lived at home, and the village still treated him as a military dependent, and his mother sometimes acted improperly, so the masses hated him very much.

    When conscription began, Li Shuwen not only did not automatically return to the team, but instead gathered five or six deserters to curse in the streets, threatening, "Let's see who dares to mobilize me." When Wei Chuansheng's mother discussed the work of returning to the team at the group meeting, she suggested that his family should join the army, but he actually went to her door to block it and curse. He refused to be mobilized, and some of the village cadres had prejudices against him and had xenophobic thoughts, so they proposed that if he did not go, he should be driven out of Monan Street. Because his ancestral home was Zhangzhigen, where he also had houses and land, the masses stood up, detained him, and sealed his door. So, the problem was not simply that he was swept out the door because he refused to return to the team.

    After the county party committee discovered this, it immediately instructed the district cadres to solve it, but due to the district cadres' face-saving and undisciplined thinking, the solution was delayed and not actively pursued. After the county gave three instructions and made severe criticisms, it was resolved (it has now been resolved for two months). The door was unsealed, and all the things were returned. He said that three hoes were missing, so the peasant association's hoes were used to replace one and 150,000 yuan was compensated. The camera bag and other items he brought back from the army were all returned.

    Finally, because Li Shuwen's other problems have not yet been resolved, he has not yet returned to the team. This manuscript was not originally written by Li Xuezhong himself, but by Comrade Sun Zhen after hearing the person's face-to-face conversation in the county political office. He did not go to the village to learn more, so it is somewhat one-sided, only mentioning the mistakes of the district cadres and village cadres, but not mentioning the aspect of his return to the team. Furthermore, four names were mistaken in this draft: Li Xuezhong's original name is Li Shujun; Li Xuewen is Li Shuwen; there is no Comrade Liu as the secretary of the county party committee; Comrade Han, the deputy secretary of the county party committee, is the deputy secretary of the district party committee.

### “把我扫地出门是谁的法令”？　献县县委已检查答复

　　“把我扫地出门是谁的法令”？
  　献县县委已检查答复
    编者按：献县县委认真检查纠正工作中的错误，并对党报意见及时检查答复，这是很好的。这是每一共产党员对党报应有的态度。各地各部门负责同志在某一问题上受到党报指摘或批评时均应采取此种态度，否则即是无组织、无纪律，是不许可的。孙振同志在代笔时未能到村深入调查，以致反映问题不够全面，个别地方并有错误，应引起以后代笔者注意，要冷静的多方分析，尽可能实际调查，以免片面夸大。另外，李书文受过人民军队的教育，回村这样态度是不允许的，应很好检讨改正，服从政府的领导。编辑及读者同志：
    关于人民日报第四十六号所登载的“把我扫地出门是谁的法令？”及六十八号所登“错误在那里？”两文答复如下：
    我县在参军中有的村庄是存在着很严重的强迫命令违犯党的政策的地方，报上给提出批评，我县很欢迎，并且作了深刻检讨与纠正。按陌南问题发生，当时“游街”“封门”俱是事实。这种严重错误发生后，县委也对该区干、村干提出严格批评，并限期立即退回原物启封其门。闹成这样严重的原因，主要是该李学忠（真名李书君）过去担任村长时贪污，用村公粮一百四十斤买地，霸占学地五亩，用村中木头盖房等，同时，作风很坏。他家原本是贫农，这几年先后分了十一亩地，由八亩增到十九亩，在家的弟兄两个都娶上了媳妇。他弟弟在部队上回来不回去了，人们都说他家忘本。他在家中住着，村中还按军属优待他，他母亲有时还发歪，所以群众很痛恨他。
    参军开始了，该李书文不但不自动归队，反而拉拢五六个逃亡战士在一块骂街，扬言“看哪个敢来动员我”，魏川生的母亲在小组会上讨论归队工作时，曾提出他家应参军，而他竟到人家门口堵门骂街。动员他不服，村干部中有一部分人与他有成见，存在排外思想，即提出如他不去，即赶出他陌南街去。因他老家是张支根，那里他有房也有地，当时群众就起来了，把他扣起来，封了他家门。所以说这个问题不是单单的因为动员李书文归队，他不归队而扫地出了门。
    县委发觉后，即马上指示区干解决，但由于区干存在好面子与无纪律的思想，致拖延不积极去解决。经县指示了三次，并提出严格批评后才解决了（现已解决了两个月了）。门启封东西完全退回，他说没了三张锄，当将农会之锄补上一张并赔了十五万元。其在部队上弄回来之照像机皮包等都退回去了。
    最后因该李书文其他问题还未解决清，所以现在还未归队。此稿原本不是李学忠自己所写，而是孙振同志在县政治处，听到该人面谈而写成，没有到村去再了解，所以让人看了是有些片面性的，光是该区干部村干部的错处，而没提到他该归队的方面。再者此一稿内弄错了四个名字：李学忠原名李书君；李学文是李书文；县委书记并没有个刘同志；县委副书记韩同志是区委副书记。
