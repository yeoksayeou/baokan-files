　　[North Yue Telegram] After Ying County was liberated, the entire party in the first district of North Yue launched a political offensive against the bandits and puppet regime. They held symposiums with the families of those in the puppet regime, explained the Party's lenient policy, and mobilized fathers to call their sons and wives to call their husbands. Two reception stations for surrendered puppet and diehard personnel were set up in Liujiazhuang Shanmencheng. They were granted freedom after registration. Those who surrendered with weapons were given bonuses. When the news reached the remnant troops of the puppet Zhang Zhen, stationed in Datong, soldiers came back in groups of three or five at first, and then in entire squads and platoons. Although the enemy in Datong repeatedly spread rumors to deceive the soldiers, saying: "Shi Fushen (a platoon leader of Zhang's bandit troops) led a platoon of brothers to surrender to the Eighth Route Army. But after handing over their guns, they were all killed. If you run back, none of you will survive." In order to expose Zhang's lies, Shi Fushen personally wrote letters to his comrades, causing even more desertions. In June and July alone, more than 1,200 people were received, bringing 77 rifles, 3 light machine guns, 5 pistols, and 3 small cannons, as well as a lot of bullets and hand grenades. More than 2,500 fugitive households were persuaded to return to their hometowns, and the government allocated land to them and arranged for them to engage in production.
　　[North Yue Telegram] Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi's troops in Chanan and Western Hebei are constantly defecting and revolting to our side. The Huailai County government received 200 Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi's soldiers in June and July. Among the 126 received in July, 65 were from the Provisional 4th Army, 20 from the Provisional 3rd Army, 35 from the 35th Army, 1 from the 32nd Army, 2 from the Provisional 10th Division, 1 from the 54th Army, and 2 from Fu Zuoyi's trusted Guard Regiment. Most of the surrendered soldiers were conscripted, and most of them were honest farmers, including 104 farmers, 13 small merchants, 5 cattle and sheep herders, 2 businessmen, 1 weaver, and 1 antique dealer. The reception station for escaped soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi's troops in Zhuolu County received 217 people from January to the end of July, bringing 6 rifles and 1 broken gun. When the Provisional 32nd Division of the 35th Bandit Army left Xiayuan, more than 30 soldiers in the ×× Company deserted in one day. In the 8th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the × Regiment of the Provisional 4th Army, Li Zengchuan and four others deserted from the 1st Platoon in two days. The 8th Squad of the 3rd Platoon was on guard in the southwest corner of Xuanhua City, and the squad leader led the entire squad to desert. The Fu Zuoyi's soldier reception station in Yuxian County registered 152 people in July.
