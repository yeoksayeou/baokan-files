　　Annihilating Locusts in Anyang
  　What Were the Specific Steps?

Editor:

In the July 18th issue of your newspaper, on the first page, there was a news item titled "Eight Counties in Taihang Suffer from Insect Pests," which included a passage about the locust-catching situation in Anyang: "Anyang has now launched a widespread mass insect eradication campaign. In the seven districts, one hundred and six natural villages... twenty-five villages have already eliminated 6,880 cartloads of locusts, and the entire district will be able to completely eliminate them in another three days."

What I question is that twenty-five villages have eliminated 6,880 cartloads. It doesn't specify how many people were mobilized in these twenty-five villages? How many days did they catch locusts? Also, what kind of carts were they? Were they carts pushed by people or pulled by animals? How much did each cart weigh? Was the number of carts estimated, or were they all actually weighed and pulled? If they were all actually weighed and pulled, with nearly 7,000 cartloads, even without calculating the locust-catching time, just loading and unloading these 6,000-plus cartloads would take a considerable amount of time. Of course, I certainly don't deny the power of the masses. Please provide further explanation from the reporter.

Secondly: In the July 12th issue, on the first page, there was a news item titled "Cadres in Guangling and Yanggao Counties Practice Economy to Provide Disaster Relief," followed by a section on the spread of infectious diseases in the third and sixth districts of Wanxian County, which stated: "Recently, in the Dayuhuang and Ningjiazhuang areas of the first district of the county... 'Cow lice' have appeared on cotton and bean plants in some villages in the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts. The masses are using water to kill the insects, and the rescue effect is significant." What I don't understand is what kind of water is being used? Is it well water, canal water, or pesticide water? And what kind of pesticide is it? Or how is it being sprayed? Please ask the reporter to provide more detailed explanations on this point, so that it can be widely used and promoted to eliminate pests and diseases.

Editor's Note: It is good to raise questions about the content of news reports. Please provide supplementary explanations immediately, branches and correspondents. News reports that lack factual details or are unclear in their presentation will weaken their guiding role. The editor's failure to clarify and revise before publishing is naturally a shortcoming and should be improved. It is very important for correspondents to pay more attention to reporting the specific process of each news item when writing articles, and to clearly explain the key points so that readers can understand them easily.

### 安阳消灭蚂蚱　具体过程是怎样的？

　　安阳消灭蚂蚱
  　具体过程是怎样的？编辑同志：
    贵报七月十八日第一版刊载标题“太行八县发生虫害”新闻，其中有一段说到安阳的捕虫情形：“安阳现已掀起广泛的群众性的除虫运动。七区一百零六个自然村……有二十五村已消灭了六千八百八十车蚂蚱，全区再有三天即可全部消灭。”
    我所怀疑者是二十五村已消灭了六千八百八十车，这里没说清二十五村，发动了多少群众？捕打了几天？另外到底是什么样的车，是人推的车呢？牲口拉的车呢？一车有多重？是估计出来的车呢？或是都经过车拉呢？如都经过车拉的话，将近七千来车，不用计算捕打的时间，光装卸这六千多车，这个时间恐怕也得用相当长的工夫。当然群众力量之大，我决不否认，请报导者再加说明。
    其次：七月十二日第一版刊载标题“广灵、阳高等县干部节约救灾”新闻，后有完县三、六区流行传染病一节，其中说：“近日该县一区大黄峪、宁家庄一带……。四、五、六区部分村庄的棉花豆角上发生了牛妮，群众用水杀虫，抢救效果很大。”我不明者是用的什么水？是井水渠水还是药水呢？又是什么药水呢？或如何喷洒呢？此点请转介绍者，再加详细说明，以便广泛使用和推广，消灭病虫害。

    编者按：对新闻内容提出疑问，是很好的。请分社及通讯员同志即予补充说明。新闻报导缺乏事实经过或交代不清，都会减弱其指导性，编者在发稿前没有弄清修正，自然是个缺点，当力谋改进。希望通讯员同志写稿时，也多注意报导每件新闻的具体过程，关节处一定要交代清楚，使读者一阅便懂，是很重要的。
