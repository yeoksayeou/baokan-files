【Taiyue Telegram】After the Gaoping County Committee called on branches and cadres to take the lead in carrying out fertilizer accumulation campaigns with their own exemplary actions, each district held branch committee member and cadre meetings in each joint defense village on the 18th and 19th of last month. After in-depth mobilization, concrete plans were made. For example, at the meeting of branch committee members and cadres of the Third Joint Defense Village in the First District, Li, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, guaranteed to take the lead in cutting 20,000 catties of artemisia. Plans were made in Pang Village, Yujing, Suzhuang, and Pu Village. After returning to the village, they all actively took action. Pang Village held a branch meeting on the 19th to mobilize and organize. Party members and cadres first took the lead and accumulated fertilizer. Shen Shuifa, chairman of the Donghao Farmers' Association, mobilized his family of six to go to the fields and cut 3,000 catties of thorns. This mobilized the masses to cut thorns and artemisia, compost dregs, pen sheep, buy sesame cakes, carry manure, dig wild manure, and carry night soil everywhere. Niu Tuhai of Pang Village locked the door and his whole family cut artemisia, cutting more than 300 catties in one day. Cui Hugen, an old man from Silibei'ao Village, who is over fifty years old, also rushed to cut artemisia, cutting more than 2,000 catties in three days. Shen Fenglian, the village chief of Dongying Village, said, "The wheat we planted last year yielded one stone per mu. Everyone said our wheat was good because we applied a lot of fertilizer. This year we want to plant six mu of stubble wheat, and we have already purchased 300 catties of sesame cakes, ready to put 300 dan of thatch fertilizer on the ground, so the seedlings will not dare to not grow well for me." Due to the vigorous and enthusiastic movement, many people changed their original wheat planting plans and wanted to plant more. Dongying, Tang'an and other villages in the Third District plan to plant 134 mu more wheat. Jueshan Village in the Second District plans to plant more than 90 mu of wheat. According to statistics from villages in the Fifth District and Labor Branch, 934,700 catties of thorns and artemisia have been cut; 2,560 carts of compost dregs have been composted; 59,010 dan of penned manure have been collected; 24,002 dan of sheep manure have been collected; 123,044 dan of thatch manure have been collected; 30,516 catties of sesame cakes have been purchased.

　　高平党员干部带头
  　割蒿压肥扩大麦田
    【太岳电】高平县委会号召支部与干部以自己的模范行动，带头展开积肥运动后，各区在上月十八、九日分别在各联防村召开支部委员及干部会议，经过深入动员，都订出了具体计划。如第一区三联防村支委及干部会议上李农会主席保证带头割蒿二万斤，庞村、玉井、苏庄、朴村等村都作了计划。回村后就都积极行动起来。庞村十九日回去就召开支部大会，动员与组织。党员干部首先以身作责，带头积肥。东郝农会主席申水法把一家六口人都动员上了地，割荆三千斤。就此把群众动员起来了，到处割荆蒿，沤渣粪，卧羊，买麻饼，挑粪，刨荒粪，担大粪。庞村牛秃孩锁住门子全家割蒿，一天就割了三百多斤。四里北凹村崔胡根老汉，已五十多岁，也抢着割蒿，三天割了两千余斤。东营村村长申丰连说：“咱去年种的麦子，一亩打了一石。都说咱的麦好，原因是咱上的粪多，今年要种六亩茬麦，已购下三百斤麻饼，准备下三百担茅粪，上在地，苗就不敢不给我长好。”由于闹起了轰轰烈烈的积极运动，不少人改变了原来的种麦计划，都要多种一些。三区东营、唐安等村，计划多种麦一百三十四亩。二区掘山村计划多种九十多亩小麦。现据五区与劳动支部村庄统计，已割下荆蒿九十三万四千七百斤；沤渣粪二千五百六十车；圈粪五万九千零一十担；羊粪二万四千零二担；茅粪十二万三千零四十四担；买麻饼三万零五百一十六斤。共能供种九千零四十九亩。
