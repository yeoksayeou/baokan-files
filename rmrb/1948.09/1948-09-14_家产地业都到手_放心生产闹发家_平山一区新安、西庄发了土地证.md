【Beiyue News】The land certificate issuance work, eagerly anticipated by the masses, has been completed in Xin'an and Xizhuang villages in the first district of Pingshan. Before the land certificates were issued in these two villages, the masses generally felt that land ownership was not determined, and they were not at ease with production. The masses in Xizhuang said, "The land doesn't even have a piece of paper to prove it, so we just plant it in a muddle. It doesn't matter if we don't apply fertilizer, we'll still get two seasons." They lacked the idea of becoming rich through production. Some people were also afraid that the land would be divided again this year. "I heard that land reform will take two or three years to complete. Who knows if it will happen again this winter?" Many people in Xin'an also said, "Today you see that the land belongs to Wang, but who knows who it will belong to tomorrow?"

When the work of issuing land certificates began, various opportunities were used to explain that the purpose of issuing land certificates was to finally determine land ownership and develop production. Immediately, land boundaries and housing property were registered (the registration was not detailed during the distribution). Xizhuang Village established a review committee, divided into land and housing property groups, measurement groups, and accounting groups, responsible for reviewing, measuring, registering, and resolving housing and land disputes. The houses of landlords were also appropriately distributed to the five families who did not have houses. At the beginning of the registration work in the village, the village cadres were not enthusiastic, and no one spoke at the meetings. After individual conversations, it was discovered that the village had concealed black land. The village cadres were afraid of being punished and having to pay public grain if they were exposed. After repeated explanations that they would not be punished as long as they reported the truth now and corrected it later, and after mobilizing the masses, more than two *qing* of black land were found. After that, the village cadres became active. Xin'an Village first called on the masses to register land boundaries through the distribution committee, but only two households registered in two days. Later, it was changed to district-based supervision and inspection, with the masses finding someone to write the land boundaries and housing property drafts themselves. After writing, they were submitted to the distribution committee for review, and disputes were resolved every midday. Only then did the masses become active, and the drafts and registration were completed in three days. The land boundary disputes of eight families, the housing site problems of three families, and the family division issues of ten families were also resolved. Twenty families who secretly returned the distributed land to the original owners now regretted it and wanted to get the returned land back. After the distribution committee completed the review, ten calligraphers were hired to fill out the land certificates separately. When filling out the registration, the masses believed that this was a permanent proof and requested that it be written in regular script, and they did not like it to be smudged with black, so special care was required. Land certificates were issued collectively. When issuing, old contracts were to be returned. After the issuance, a mass meeting was convened to explain that land ownership had been finally determined and would not be changed again, and that everyone should be at ease with production. Finally, the old contracts were burned in public. At the land certificate issuance meeting in Xizhuang Village, the masses discussed the problem of Liu Shuangkui, a loafer who ate and drank lavishly, liked to gamble, and did not work hard in production, and decided not to issue him a land certificate for the time being, and to issue it after he had truly reformed. After the land certificates were issued, the masses felt that the land was truly their own, and they cherished the land certificates very much. When a farmer in Xizhuang saw a member of the work team, he asked him to read his land certificate for him, fearing that it was written incorrectly. After receiving the land certificates, everyone carefully folded them and kept them safe. From then on, the "stone in the hearts" of the masses was put down. Yu Lianrong, an old man in Xizhuang, said, "This time it's insured. The family property and land are all in hand. We must produce well in the future!" (Fourth Branch)

　　家产地业都到手
  　放心生产闹发家
  　平山一区新安、西庄发了土地证
    【北岳讯】平山一区新安、西庄两村，群众热望的土地证颁发工作业已完成。该两村土地证颁发前，群众普遍觉得地权未确定，生产不安心，西庄群众说：“地连个凭据也没有，稀里糊涂种上算了，不上粪也闹两季”，缺乏生产致富思想。也有的人怕今年还平分，“听说土改两三年才完成，谁知道今年冬天还闹不闹？”新安不少群众也说：“今天你看着那地姓王，明天谁知道它姓什么？”
    发土地证工作开始时，先利用各种机会，说明发土地证为了最后确定地权，发展生产。随即进行土地四至，与房产的登记，（平分时登记得不详细）西庄村成立了审查委员会，分为地亩房产组，丈量组、会计组，负责审查、丈量、登记与解决房地纠纷，五家没房产的也将地主房屋适当分给他们一部。该村登记工作之初，村干不起劲，开会谁也不发言。经过个别谈话，发现该村瞒有黑地，村干怕暴露了受处分，赔公粮，经过再三说明只要现在实报以后改正，就不处分，又向群众进行了动员，结果查出黑地两顷多，此后村干就积极起来。新安村先由平分委员会号召群众登记土地四至，但两天来登记者只有两户，后改为分片督促检查，由群众自己找人代写土地四至，房产草底，写好后交平分委员会审查，每日晌午解决纠纷，这群众刚才积极起来，三天草底、登记即告完成，还解决了八家的地界争执问题，三家房址问题，十家分家的。二十家暗自将分得土地退回原主的现在又后悔了，也将退回土地要回。分委会审查完毕，聘请了十个掌笔先生，分别填写土地证。在填写登记时，群众认为这是永久的凭据，要求写正楷，不喜欢涂抹得一片片黑，因而需要特别细心。发土地证采取集体发的方式，发时要交回旧文契，发完即召开了群众大会，说明地权已最后确定再不变更，大家要安心生产，最后当众将旧文契烧毁。西庄村在发土地证会上，由群众讨论了胡吃乱喝、好耍钱、不努力生产的二流子刘双魁的问题，决定暂不发给土地证，等他真正转变后再发。土地证颁发后，群众觉得土地真是自己的了，对土地证非常爱惜。西庄一个农民一见到工作组同志，就叫给他念土地证，恐怕写错了，领到土地证后大家都把它好好折叠包藏起来。从此，群众“心里的石头放下了”，西庄老汉于连荣说：“这回可保险了，家产地业都到手了，以后可得好好生产哩！”（四支社）
