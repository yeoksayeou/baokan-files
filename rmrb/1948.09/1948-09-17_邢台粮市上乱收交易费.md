　　To the Editor:
    In the grain markets in Dongmenli and Nanguan Mashi Street in Xingtai City, some people are illegally collecting handling fees. Regardless of whether they give the agreed grain price or weigh the grain, they charge 250 yuan per dou as a handling fee for anyone selling grain, and only allow them to leave the market after issuing a small strip of hemp paper one inch wide and two inches long. They don't even allow grain that hasn't been sold to leave the market. The government has stipulated that no handling fees should be paid for transactions not completed through a broker. Why are they not acting in accordance with government laws and regulations and forcibly collecting handling fees? The masses have a lot of opinions about this. Please inspect and correct this situation quickly, Xingtai Municipal Government!

　　邢台粮市上乱收交易费编辑同志：
    邢台市东门里及南关马市街两粮食市上，都有些人在乱收手续费，他们不管给成交粮价，也不给过斗过秤，谁要卖了粮食，每斗要抽手续费二百五十元，给开一个一寸宽二寸长的麻纸小条才准出市场；没有粜的粮食，也不让出市场。政府曾有规定：不经交易员成交的买卖，不缴纳手续费。他们为什么不按政府法令办事，而强收手续费。群众对这一点意见很大，请邢台市府赶快检查纠正！邢台市苏夫
