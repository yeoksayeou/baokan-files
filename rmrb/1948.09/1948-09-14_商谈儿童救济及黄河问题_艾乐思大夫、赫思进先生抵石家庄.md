　　Discussing Child Relief and the Yellow River Issue
  　Dr. Etheldred Brown and Mr. Hersey Arrive in Shijiazhuang
    Xinhua News Agency, North China, 11th -- Dr. Etheldred Brown (American), representative of the North China Working Team of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, Mr. Han Li-Ting (American), and Mr. Hersey (American), President of the American Friends Service Committee, Mr. J. Bradbury (British), Mr. MacFarland (American), and Mr. Yu Hengrui (Chinese), arrived in Shijiazhuang in mid-August, having come to the Liberated Areas from Tianjin and Henan respectively. Dr. Brown and others are here to discuss with the General Headquarters [of the People's Liberation Army] the use of the $500,000 allocated to the Liberated Areas. Mr. Hersey's mission is primarily to respond to the appeal of Comrade Dong Biwu, Director of the General Headquarters, to stop the Kuomintang army's bombing and destruction of the Yellow River dikes, and to discuss this matter with the General Headquarters. At the same time, they will take the opportunity to discuss specific issues related to medical relief in the Liberated Areas.
    Note: The International Children's Emergency Fund is an agency under the United Nations, established in December 1946, with more than twenty participating countries. It is a committee with an executive department in New York. It also has offices or working teams in each participating country. In the Far East, it currently has only two working teams in China, one in the Kuomintang-controlled area and one in the Liberated Area (i.e., the North China Working Team). The American Friends Service Committee is an international relief organization that began working in China in 1941 and has its headquarters in Shanghai.

　　商谈儿童救济及黄河问题
  　艾乐思大夫、赫思进先生抵石家庄
    【新华社华北十一日电】联合国国际儿童紧急基金委员会华北工作队代表艾乐思大夫（美国人）、韩立亭先生（美国人）及公谊服务会会长赫思进先生（美国人）、会员贾伯里先生（英国人）、麦福兰先生（美国人）、余蘅瑞先生（中国人），分别自天津及河南来解放区，于上月中旬抵达石家庄。艾乐思氏等此行任务，系与解总商谈拨与解放区五十万美金之用途问题。赫思进氏此行任务，则主要系响应解总董必武主任关于制止国民党军轰炸破坏黄河堤岸之呼吁，前来与解总商谈。同时借此机会商谈一些对解放区医药救济的具体问题。
    按：国际儿童紧急基金委员会是联合国下面的一个机关，成立于一九四六年十二月，参加者有二十多个国家，是一个委员会，下设执行部于纽约，另在参加各国均设有办事处或工作队。在远东现仅在中国设有两个工作队，一在国民党统治区，一在解放区（即华北工作队）。公谊服务会是一个国际救济团体，一九四一年开始即在中国工作，其总部设于上海。
