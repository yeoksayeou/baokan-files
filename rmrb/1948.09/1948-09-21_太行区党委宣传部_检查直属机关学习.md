　　Taihang District Party Committee Propaganda Department
  　Inspects Learning in Directly Subordinate Organizations
    [Taihang Electric Dispatch] The Propaganda Department of the Taihang District Party Committee convened the second study meeting of directly subordinate organizations on August 25th to examine the learning situation of the Four Great Documents. After more than a month of study, most organizations have completed the first two documents. Many comrades felt after studying that their theoretical level was low, and they did not pay attention to the Party's policies, relying on narrow experience to blindly and recklessly act, committing many unnecessary mistakes. The meeting made special research and discussion on improving learning methods and other issues, and first required leaders to personally lead, grasp the key points and give timely guidance, regularly summarize experience, answer difficult questions, and instruct on improved methods. The task of the organization's branch should be regular inspection. Secondly, it emphasized ideological leadership to enlighten comrades' learning consciousness, cultivate their ability to independently think about problems, advocate freedom of thought, boldly put forward different opinions, and debate to their heart's content, but when a stage is over, the leadership must make a clear conclusion. In terms of learning methods, empiricism should be opposed. Some comrades one-sidedly exaggerated practical experience, and in handling practical problems and solving specific ideological problems, they showed that they could not improve, treating the foot when it hurts and the head when it hurts. There were also some comrades who regarded themselves as "practical," had no reading habits, and had no interest in exploration and research. When they saw others flipping through books or looking for reference materials in their studies, they thought it was dogmatism. In the future, attention should be paid to making every comrade attach importance to theory and overcome empiricism. Third, learning should not be regarded as a shock task, and should not be too tense. Individual organizations study in the morning, work during the day, and study again at night, and everyone feels very tired. It should be carried out step by step, and the study of the Four Great Documents should be used to regularize the learning of organ cadres.

　　太行区党委宣传部
  　检查直属机关学习
    【太行电】此间区党委宣传部，于八月廿五日召开直属机关第二次学习会议，检查四大文件的学习情况。经过月余学习，大部机关都学完了前两个文件。许多同志学习以后感觉到自己理论水平既低，又不注意党的政策，凭着狭隘的经验盲目蛮干，犯了许多不应有的错误。会上对改进学习方法等问题，作了专门研究讨论，首先要求首长亲自领导，抓住关键给以及时指导，定期总结经验，解答疑难，指示改进方法。而机关支部的任务，应是经常的检查。其次强调思想领导，以启发同志们的学习自觉，培养他们独立思考问题的能力，提倡思想自由，大胆提出分歧意见，尽情争辩，但告一段落时，一定由领导上作出明确结论。在学习方法上要反对经验主义。有些同志片面的夸大了实际经验，在处理实际问题和解决具体思想问题时，表现出提不高，脚痛医脚头痛医头。另有一些同志，以“实际”自居，无读书习惯，更无探讨钻研兴趣，看到别人在学习中翻翻书本子或找点参考材料的学习，就认为教条主义。今后应注意使每个同志重视理论，克服经验主义。第三、学习不能当作一个突击任务，不应过分紧张，个别机关早上学习白天工作，晚上又学习，大家觉得很疲劳。应按步就班的进行，通过四大文件学习把机关干部学习经常化起来。
