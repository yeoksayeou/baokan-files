　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. U.S. monopoly capitalists are preparing to monopolize Taiwan's fertilizer industry. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Taipei on the 8th, a "Fertilizer Industry Technology Investigation Group" dominated by the U.S. side has flown from Shanghai to Taipei on the 7th. The group includes Mr. Xie Erkai, General Manager of Shanghai Shenchang Foreign Firm and Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, Mr. Weng Yi'an, engineer of the firm, Mr. Xu Shanxiang, representative of American Chemical Construction Company in China, and Mr. Huang Renjie, Deputy Director of the preparatory office of the Central Fertilizer Company of the Kuomintang government. The dispatch stated that the investigation group is "related to U.S. aid, but not dispatched by the ECA China Mission." They will visit the Taiwan Fertilizer Company in Keelung and will also go to Hsinchu, Kaohsiung, and other places. It is said that the plan to build a sulfuric acid plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons in Hsinchu County will be implemented as soon as the group completes its investigation. A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 3rd revealed that the plant has been decided to be jointly invested and operated by American businesses and the Kuomintang's so-called "national banks."
