Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 24th: Kuomintang officers and soldiers besieged in Changchun are fleeing the city of death to surrender to the People's Liberation Army. According to statistics from our Changchun Frontline Command: From June 25th to September 5th, in the two months and ten days, the besieging forces have taken in a total of 13,000 people, accounting for more than one-tenth of the enemy's total force. This includes more than 8,800 soldiers from the enemy's regular army, the New 7th Army and the 60th Army. According to incomplete statistics, there are a total of 298 officers at the rank of Major and Captain; among them, Luo Zhenya, a Major and Deputy Battalion Commander of the 60th Army, and Cai Songpo, a Captain and Company Commander of the Temporary 52nd Division, surrendered with their weapons. Collective surrenders with weapons include the Cavalry Security Brigade and other units, totaling 259 people. In total, the surrendering soldiers brought with them 4 60mm mortars, 1 rifle grenade launcher, 30 light machine guns, 49 submachine guns, 2 signal guns, a total of 1,364 rifles and other guns, more than 60,000 rounds of various ammunition, 1 radio, 4 telephones, 21 binoculars, and 8 warhorses.

When these surrendering Kuomintang officers and soldiers crossed the firing line, the People's Liberation Army provided cover and repelled enemy pursuers, ensuring their safe arrival at the People's Liberation Army positions. They all believe that the sentry line, only 100 meters apart, is a boundary between life and death; staying on the other side means certain death, and escaping to this side means happiness and a bright future.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 25th: On the 18th and 19th, two companies of the enemy besieged in Changchun collectively surrendered. On the 18th, Lu Fengwu, the Company Commander of the 2nd Regiment of the enemy's Jilin Security Brigade, led 24 men to surrender to our army. The next day, Qi Fengfa, the Company Commander of the enemy's Cavalry Brigade, led 55 men to surrender. The two companies brought with them a total of 70 rifles and other guns, 9 submachine guns, 2 light machine guns, and 1 60mm mortar.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 26th: The Changchun Frontline Command of the People's Liberation Army recently issued a stern warning to the enemy garrisoning Changchun: if they do not immediately cease their large-scale destructive actions against Changchun, the People's Liberation Army will severely punish them separately after the liberation of Changchun. The Kuomintang bandit army, facing extinction, is now frantically demolishing houses. Thousands of buildings surrounding the suburbs of Changchun have been completely destroyed, and now the demolition has reached the central area. All beams, rafters, doors, windows, tables, chairs, furniture, etc., have been looted for firewood. Large numbers of Kuomintang bandit troops are dispatched every day, driving away residents on one hand and climbing onto roofs to demolish buildings on the other. The entire city is filled with dust, appearing a hazy yellow from a distance. Part of the Changchun University dormitory has also been demolished, and all books and instruments have been looted and sold by the bandits; the well-equipped instruments and equipment of the medical school have been completely stolen. All factories have been turned into barracks; most of the machinery has been damaged, stolen, or used for defensive fortifications. Scattered machine parts can now be picked up near every factory site. The machinery and wiring of the large substation in the east of the city are in disarray and beyond repair. All public facilities in the city, such as water pipes, heating pipes, and electrical wires, have also been largely destroyed for use in bunker construction. Only a few of the power poles in the city remain, except for the iron ones. The transformers on the poles have been smashed, and the insulating oil inside has been taken to clean guns. The beautiful trees on the major streets of Changchun have been mostly cut down, leaving only rows of stumps. The bandit troops even dig up the asphalt and coal slag on the asphalt roads for fuel. This desperate destructive behavior of the enemy garrisoning Changchun has aroused unprecedented resentment among the people of the city.

　　长春国民党军官兵纷纷逃出死城
  　两个月万余人向我投诚
    我军警告长春守敌停止疯狂破坏
    【新华社东北二十四日电】困守长春的国民党军官兵，纷纷逃出死城向解放军投诚。据我长春前线指挥部统计：自六月二十五日至九月五日的两个月零十天中，围城部队共已收容一万三千人，达守敌总兵力的十分之一以上。其中包括敌正规军新七军、六十军所部共八千八百余名。据不完全统计，共有校尉级军官二百九十八名；其中六十军少校团副罗震亚、暂五十二师上尉连长蔡松坡等多人皆系携械投诚者。集体携械投诚的，有骑兵保安旅等部共二百五十九名。总计投诚者共携来六零炮四门，枪榴筒一具，轻机枪三十挺，冲锋式四十九支，信号枪二支，长短枪等共一千三百六十四支，各种弹药六万余发，电台一架，电话机四架，望远镜二十一个，军马八匹。
    这些投诚的国民党军官兵逃越火线时，解放军都予以接应，击退敌人追兵，使他们安全到达解放军阵地。他们都认为相距仅一百米的步哨线，就是一条生死界，留在那边便是死路，逃过来就是幸福和光明大道。
    【新华社东北二十五日电】十八、十九两日长春被围之敌，两连集体投诚。十八日敌吉林保安旅二团一连连长卢凤武率部二十四人归降我军。次日，敌骑兵旅连长齐风发又率部五十五人来归。两连共携来长短枪七十支，冲锋式九支，轻机枪两挺，六零炮一门。
    【新华社东北廿六日电】解放军长春前线指挥部，顷对长春守敌发出严厉警告，如不立即停止对长春的大规模的破坏行动，则解放军于解放长春之后，决分别予以严厉惩处。面临灭亡的国民党匪军现正疯狂地拆房，围绕长春市郊的成千幢楼房，已被拆毁殆尽，现并已拆到中心区。所有梁椽、门窗、桌椅、家具等全部被抢去作了烧柴。每日国民党匪军大批出动，一面驱逐居民，一面就架梯子上房。全市尘土冲天，远望一片昏黄。长春大学宿舍一部亦已被拆除，图书仪器全部为匪劫卖；设备完善的医学院的仪器器材，被盗窃一空。所有工厂都作了兵营；机器大都被损被盗或作了防御工事。每一厂址附近，现都可拾到散落的机器零件。城东大变压所机器、线架东倒西歪，不可收拾。市内各公共设备，如自来水管、暖气管、电线等也大部被毁作地堡工事，全城电线杆除铁的以外，已所剩无几。电杆上之变压器都被砸毁，其中之绝缘油被拿去擦枪。长春各大街上美丽的树木，绝大部分均被砍去，只剩下一排一排的树桩。匪军甚至把柏油马路上的沥青和煤屑掘起来当燃料。长春守敌的这种绝望的破坏行为，已引起该市人民的空前愤恨。
