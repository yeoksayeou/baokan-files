　　Major Step Towards Establishing a Unified, Independent, and Democratic Korea
  　All-Korean People Elect Supreme People's Assembly
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd] TASS, Pyongyang, 29th: According to the resolution of the Second Conference of North and South Korean political parties and social organizations regarding the establishment of the All-Korean Supreme People's Assembly and a unified Korean government, the All-Korean people held elections for representatives to the Supreme People's Assembly on August 25th. In North Korea, the elections were conducted through universal, direct, equal, and secret ballots. On that day, early in the morning, many voters in the 212 electoral districts of North Korea gathered in queues to prepare for voting even before the polling stations opened. Within three to five hours after the start of voting, almost all voters had completed their ballots. As this election was a major step in the process of the Korean people establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korean nation, the election in North Korea turned into a national festival. Mass celebrations were held in towns and villages, continuing joyously until late at night.
    In South Korea, the election of the All-Korean Supreme People's Assembly could not be held through direct voting due to the frenzied suppression by the US occupying authorities and the South Korean reactionaries. However, under the leadership of the Special Guidance Committee appointed by the North and South Korean political parties and social organizations conference, the South Korean people divided the election into two stages: first, the South Korean people elected representatives to the South Korean People's Congress, and then the Congress elected representatives to the Supreme People's Assembly. As previously reported, the representatives of the South Korean People's Congress elected by the South Korean people held a conference in Haeju City, North Korea, on August 21st. After discussing the list of candidates for South Korean representatives to the Supreme People's Assembly, the congress elected the South Korean representatives to attend the Supreme People's Assembly on August 25th.

　　建立统一独立民主朝鲜的重大步骤
  　全鲜人民选举最高议会
    【新华社陕北二日电】塔斯社平壤二十九日讯：根据南北朝鲜各政党及社会团体第二次会议关于成立全朝鲜最高人民议会及单一朝鲜政府的决议，全朝鲜人民于八月二十五日举行了最高人民议会代表的选举。在北朝鲜，选举系于普遍、直接、平等及秘密投票的方式下进行。是日清晨，北朝鲜二百一十二个选区中的许多选民早在投票所开始办公之前，即结队前往准备投票。在投票开始后三小时至五小时内，几乎全体选民都已完成投票。由于这次选举是朝鲜人民为建立统一、独立、民主的朝鲜国家过程中的重大步骤，选举在北朝鲜变成了全国的节目。各城镇乡村都举行了人民的群众庆祝活动，胜欢至深夜始止。
    在南朝鲜，全朝鲜最高人民议会的选举由于遭受美国占领当局及南朝鲜反动派的疯狂镇压，不能举行直接投票。但在南北朝鲜政党及社会团体会议所委派的特别指导委员会的领导下，南朝鲜人民将选举分为两阶段进行：即南朝鲜人民先选举南朝鲜人民代表大会的代表，再由代表大会选出最高人民议会的代表。如前已报导者，南朝鲜人民所选出的南朝鲜人民代表大会的代表，已于八月二十一日在北朝鲜的海州城举行大会。大会在讨论了最高人民议会南朝鲜代表的候选名单后，于二十五日选出了南朝鲜出席最高人民议会的代表。
