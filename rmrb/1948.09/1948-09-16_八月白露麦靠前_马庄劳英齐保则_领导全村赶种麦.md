　　“Plant Wheat Before the White Dew in August”
  　Labor Hero Qi Baoze of Mazhuang
  　Leads the Whole Village to Rush Plant Wheat
    [Taiyue Electric] "Plant wheat before the White Dew in August, plant wheat after the White Dew in July." Qi Baoze, a labor hero from Mazhuang, Tunliu, has led the whole village to finish planting 105 mu of old wheat land ahead of schedule. Last year, the village did not pay attention to seed selection when planting wheat, and because the planting was too late (according to experts, if wheat seeds do not emerge nine days after being planted, it means the planting was too late and the wheat will not grow well), wheat blight was very serious this summer. Out of the village's one hundred mu or so of wheat, only two mu were not blighted. Shi Xiaomao's six mu of wheat only yielded five dou. Labor hero Qi Baoze learned from this lesson. In addition to paying attention to seed selection, this year he paid special attention to leading the masses to plant wheat according to the season. This year, the White Dew fell on the sixth day of the eighth lunar month, so the wheat should be planted before the White Dew. Therefore, after hoeing the millet for the third time, Qi Baoze held a meeting with various mutual aid groups to discuss wheat planting. They unanimously recognized the benefits of early planting and formulated a specific wheat planting plan to plant wheat early. On August 23rd, led by group leader Chen Haitang and others, they began planting wheat. By September 5th, in twelve days, all 105 mu of old wheat land in the village had been planted. In terms of seed selection, in addition to exchanging some good wheat with each other, group leader Cheng De also went to Wangjiazhuang, Qin County, to exchange for more than five dou of wheat seeds, and other groups exchanged good wheat seeds on their own. Some people also used warm water to soak the seeds. Baoze also experimented with rubbing the wheat seeds with wine to ensure that they would not become moldy next year. Now, they are rushing to plant 25 mu of replanted wheat. The hemp fields have also been plowed twice, and can be planted within a day or two.

　　“八月白露麦靠前”
  　马庄劳英齐保则
  　领导全村赶种麦
    【太岳电】“八月白露麦靠前，七月白露麦靠后”，屯留马庄劳动英雄齐保则领导全村，已将一百零五亩老麦地提前下种完毕。该村去年种麦没注意选种，又因种的太迟（据行家谈麦籽入土九天后上不来，就是种迟了，长不好），今夏麦霉很厉害。全村一百来亩麦子，只有二亩麦没霉。史小茂家六亩麦只打了五斗。劳动英雄齐保则，接受了这一教训，除注意选种外，今年特别注意领导群众按节令种麦。今年是阴历八月初六日白露，在白露前把麦种好。所以在锄完三遍谷后，齐保则就和各互助组开了个讨论种麦的会议，一致认识了早种有好处，订出具体种麦计划，提前种麦。八月二十三日，在组长陈海堂等带头下，就开始种麦，至九月五日为止，十二天已将全村一百零五亩老麦地全部下种。在选种上、除互相调换一部分好麦外，组长成德还到沁县王家庄换回五斗多麦籽，其他各组都各自调换下好麦种。有些人还用温汤浸种。保则还试验用酒搓麦种，以保证明年不生霉。现在，又赶种回茬麦二十五亩，葫麻茬地也已犁过两遍，一二日内即可下种。
