Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Front, 28th: Our frontline correspondent reports: The Kuomintang army's outer defense system around Jinan, extending over a hundred miles north-south and east-west, was completely shattered after three days and four nights of fierce attacks by the powerful People's Liberation Army. The PLA's offensive spearheads quickly reached the city walls and commercial district of Jinan. Jinan's defensive fortifications, built over many years by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang army, and further reinforced by the enemy chieftain Wang Yaowu in recent months, formed a modern, semi-permanent defense system. A deep and tight four-layered defensive system, consisting of outer positions, forward positions, main positions, and core positions, was constructed in the vast area north from Queshan Mountain on the northern bank of the Yellow River, south to Wandekezhan Station on the Jinpu Railway, east to Guodian Station on the Jiaoji Railway, and west to the counties of Changqing and Qihe, protecting the urban area of Jinan. The outer positions were made up of towns and strongholds such as Changqing, Qihe, Gushan, and Zhonggong, located twenty to sixty *li* from Jinan, dotted with pillboxes and crisscrossed by trenches. The enemy intended to use these to prevent the PLA's advance and deplete its combat power. However, on the first night of the PLA's offensive (the night of the 16th), these towns and strongholds suffered devastating blows and collapsed across the board. The defending enemy was either annihilated (as in Changqing) or scattered (as in Gushan and Zhonggong). The PLA advanced rapidly, like a hot knife through butter, directly attacking the forward and main positions. The forward positions, fifteen to twenty *li* from the city, consisted of more than sixty small strongholds; the main positions, within fifteen *li* of the city, consisted of over a hundred strong and fortified strongholds, including the Yellow River Railway Bridge, the airfield under Thousand Buddha Mountain, and the army barracks. Strongholds such as Lashan, Jingjiagou, Maolingshan, and Pingdingshan all had numerous mother-and-son pillboxes and cavity-style fortifications, constructed of reinforced concrete or thick earth and stone, with depth and focus, and a tight interlocking fire network. The defending enemy had fantasized about stubbornly resisting here. However, under the powerful artillery fire and the astonishing bravery of the PLA, the enemy's three lines of defense were shattered in just three days and four nights from the 17th to the 19th. Most of the strongholds and defending enemy were captured and annihilated, leaving only a few isolated remnants and strongholds that had been cut off. On the night of the 19th, the PLA attacked the core positions consisting of Jinan's outer moat and the commercial district. At this point, the first stage of the Battle of Jinan had achieved a decisive victory. The rapid progress of the offensive reflected the unprecedented strength of the PLA and the vigorous fighting spirit of the commanders and soldiers, demonstrating that no solid fortifications could stop the PLA's advance. A saying was widely spread among the frontline soldiers and participating laborers: "Too fast! Too fast!"

　　强大炮火无坚不摧
  　粉碎济南敌外围防御经过
    【新华社济南前线二十八日电】前线记者报道：国民党军在济南周围南北、东西各百余里的外围防御体系，经强大的解放军三昼四夜的勇猛攻击即被彻底粉碎。各路解放军的攻势矛头迅即抵达济市城垣与商埠区。济南的防御工事经过日寇与国民党军多年的构筑，又加上敌酋王耀武最近数月日夜增修，形成现代化半永久性的防御体系。北起黄河北岸的鹊山、南抵津浦路万德车站、东至胶济路郭店车站、西达长清、齐河县城的广阔地带内，编成了外围阵地、警戒阵地、主阵地与核心阵地四层纵深严密的防御工事，围护济南市区。外围阵地是由距济南二十至六十华里的长清、齐河、崮山、中宫等城镇据点所构成，点碉林立，沟壕纵横。敌人准备据此以阻止解放军的前进与消耗解放军的战力。但在解放军发起攻势的第一夜（即十六日夜），这些城镇据点就受到了毁灭性的打击，全线崩溃。守敌或被歼（如长清）或溃散（如崮山、中宫）。解放军长驱直入，势如破竹，直捣警戒阵地与主阵地。警戒阵地距城十五至二十里，为六十余小据点所构成；主阵地为距城十五里以内地带，黄河大铁桥、千佛山下飞机场与陆军营房等百余强固据点所构成。其中腊山、井家沟、茂岭山、平顶山等据点均拥有大量的子母堡群与夹壁式工事，为钢骨水泥或高厚的土石筑成，有纵深、有重点，并有严密的交叉火力网，守敌曾幻想凭此顽抗。但在解放军的强大炮火与惊人的勇猛的巨大威力下，仅十七日至十九日短促的三昼四夜内敌三道阵地即告粉碎，大部据点与守敌被攻克、歼灭，只剩少数被分割的孤立的残敌与据点。十九日夜各路解放军即攻至济城外壕与商埠所构成的核心阵地。至此，解放济南之战第一阶段即取得决定的胜利。攻势进展的神速，反映了解放军空前强大与指战员旺盛斗志；说明任何坚固工事也无法阻止解放军前进。前线战士和参战民工普遍流传着一句话：“太快了！太快了！”
