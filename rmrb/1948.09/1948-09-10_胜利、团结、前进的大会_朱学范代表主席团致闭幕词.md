　　A Victorious, United, and Forward-Looking Congress

　　Zhu Xuefan Delivers Closing Remarks on Behalf of the Presidium

　　The Labor Congress held its closing ceremony on August 22nd. Mr. Zhu Xuefan delivered the closing remarks on behalf of the Congress Presidium, calling the congress "a victorious congress, a united congress, a forward-looking congress." Mr. Zhu stated that this congress was the first national unity that the working class across the country had looked forward to day and night for nineteen years, ever since the Fifth National Labor Congress was secretly convened in Shanghai in 1929, and had strived for at every moment. At the same time, the convening of this congress also occurred as the People's Liberation Army was victoriously advancing towards the areas ruled by the traitorous and corrupt Kuomintang reactionaries, just as the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in its congratulatory message: "This indicates that our people's liberation war under the leadership of the proletariat has reached its final victory, that a new national revolutionary period has arrived, and that the Kuomintang reactionary clique's policy of splitting the working class across the country has finally been declared bankrupt, and the national workers' movement has been reunited under the banner of revolution."

　　He pointed out that the gains of this congress are limitless, precious, and great.

　　First of all, through this congress, the working class across the country has a more correct and victorious direction in terms of understanding and future goals. This direction is that the working class across the country should first unite itself, and then unite with peasants, independent laborers, freelancers, intellectuals, the national bourgeoisie, and all patriotic elements to completely overthrow the rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary clique, and establish a new democratic people's democratic republic under the victorious banner of the Communist Party of China, the vanguard of the working class, and Comrade Mao Zedong.

　　Secondly, the congress reinstated the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and elected formal and alternate executive committee members, forming the unified supreme leading organ of the mass organization of the working class in China. It unites 2.83 million workers in various enterprises in major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the liberated areas to fight the final victorious struggle against American imperialism and its running dog, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in China, with unified steps. This organization—the All-China Federation of Trade Unions—is a powerful force in the democratic front of the world's working class against imperialism, anti-aggression, anti-oppression, and anti-split. Under the banner of the World Federation of Trade Unions, it will strive for the democratic, peaceful, united, and unified direction of the world's trade union movement and wage an irreconcilable struggle against the reactionary camp headed by American imperialism, especially against the conspiracy to split the world's trade union movement by means of the "Marshall Plan."

　　Thirdly, the congress listened to the reports on the labor movement and work reports from various regions and carefully studied issues such as working hours, wages, and workers' welfare, and made specific provisions in the current task resolution. These are things that the working class in China had struggled for for decades in the old society without achieving, but were victoriously resolved at this congress.

　　At the same time, after hearing the reports on the labor movement and workers' lives in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the congress unanimously passed the "Resolution on the Report on the Labor Movement in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas" and decided that workers in various liberated areas should volunteer one day of work to support their struggle. As soon as this resolution was announced, workers in various parts of Northeast China immediately responded and have already donated tens of millions of yuan (Northeast currency). This shows that the struggle of the worker comrades in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is not isolated. They have the support of 2.83 million members of the unified and united All-China Federation of Trade Unions as their backing, and their liberation struggle will surely achieve victory more quickly.

　　Finally, the congress unanimously supported convening a revolutionary new political consultative conference without the participation of reactionaries, and advocated that it be convened by the Communist Party of China, thereby establishing a revolutionary coalition government.

　　Mr. Zhu stated: "Now the time has come: the democratic forces of the world are rising, and the liberation of the Chinese people is approaching final victory. Whoever wants to carry out imperialist aggression, whoever wants to carry out reactionary rule, will suffer destruction under the blow of the democratic forces. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions must lead and urge the working class in the liberated areas to increase production and support the front lines, and lead and urge the working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to continue their heroic struggle, prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army, and liberate all of China. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions must, based on the glorious tradition of the working class struggle during the 'February 7th', 'May 30th', 'Guangdong-Hong Kong Strike', the three uprisings in Shanghai, and the First Great Revolution, and the spirit of the heroic figures in the struggle such as Lin Xiangqian, Shi Yang, Liu Hua, Wang Shouhua, Su Zhaozheng, Deng Zhongxia, Luo Dengxian, Deng Fa and other comrades, complete the great revolutionary cause. After the representatives return to their posts, they must use the greatest determination and flexible methods to complete the various tasks assigned to us by the congress; when each of us has done our due strength, our complete liberation will be achieved very quickly."

　　Finally, on behalf of the Congress, he expressed his gratitude to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the domestic and foreign working class and democratic groups, and the various spiritual encouragement and material condolences given to the Labor Congress by the Party, government, military and people of the Northeast Liberated Area and various organizations.

　　胜利、团结、前进的大会
  　朱学范代表主席团致闭幕词
    【新华社东北七日电】劳动大会于上月二十二日举行闭幕典礼，朱学范氏代表大会主席团致闭幕词，他把这次大会称之为“胜利的大会，团结的大会，前进的大会”。朱氏称：这次大会是全国工人阶级自一九二九年在上海秘密召集第五次全国劳动大会以来，十九年间日日夜夜盼望，时时刻刻争取的第一次全国性的大团结。同时这次大会的召开，又是在人民解放军向卖国的腐朽的国民党反动派所统治的地区胜利大进军的时候，正如中共中央祝词中所指出的：“表示在无产阶级领导下的我们人民解放战争已经走到最后胜利，表示全国性的新的大革命时期又已到来，表示国民党反动集团在全国工人中的分裂政策已经最后宣告破产，全国工人运动重新在革命的旗帜下统一起来。”
    他指出这次大会的收获是无可限量的、宝贵的、伟大的。
    首先，经过这次大会，使我们全国工人阶级在认识上和今后奋斗目标上有了一个更正确的和胜利的方向，这个方向就是：全国工人阶级首先应该团结自己、并联合农民、独立劳动者、自由职业者、知识分子、自由资产阶级与一切爱国分子，为彻底推翻美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动集团在中国的统治，在工人阶级先锋队共产党与毛泽东同志胜利的旗帜下，建立新民主主义的人民民主共和国。
    其次，大会恢复了中华全国总工会、并选出了正式和候补执行委员，组成了全中国工人阶级群众组织的统一的最高领导机关。它团结了国民党统治区各大城市和解放区的各种企业的二百八十三万工人，以统一步伐，向美帝国主义及其走狗国民党在中国反动统治作最后的胜利的斗争，这个组织——中华全国总工会，是世界工人阶级反帝、反侵略、反压迫及反分裂的民主阵线上一支有力量的队伍。它将在世界职工联合会的旗帜下，为世界职工运动的民主、和平、团结、统一的方向而奋斗，向以美帝国主义为首的反动阵营，尤其是以“马歇尔计划”为手段的分裂世界职工运动的阴谋作不调和的斗争。
    再次，大会听取了各个地区的工运报告和工作报告，并仔细地研究了工时、工资和工人福利等问题，在目前任务决议案中都作了具体规定。这些是过去我们中国工人阶级在旧社会中奋斗了几十年还没有争取到的，而在这一次大会上胜利解决了。
    同时，在听到了国民党统治区工人运动与工人生活的报告后，大会一致通过了“关于国民党统治区职工运动报告的决议”，并决定各解放区职工作义务工一天，支援他们的斗争。这一决议传出，东北各地职工立刻响应，已献款几千万元（东北币）。这说明了国民党统治区的职工同志们的斗争不是孤立的，他们有统一团结的中华全国总工会下二百八十三万会员作他们的后盾，他们的解放斗争一定会更快的得到胜利。
    最后大会又一致拥护召开没有反动派参加的革命的新的政治协商会议，并且主张由中共来召集，从而建立革命的联合政府。
    朱氏称：“现在时候到了：全世界民主力量日益高涨，中国人民的解放已接近最后胜利，谁要实行帝国主义侵略，谁要实行反动统治，谁就要在民主力量的打击之下遭受灭亡。中华全国总工会要领导和督促解放区工人阶级增加生产、支援前线，要领导和督促国民党统治区工人阶级继续英勇斗争，准备迎接解放军，解放全中国。中华全国总工会要根据历史上‘二七’、‘五卅’、‘省港罢工’、上海三次起义和第一次大革命时期工人阶级斗争的光荣传统和斗争中的英雄人物象林祥谦、施洋、刘华、汪寿华、苏兆征、邓中夏、罗登贤、邓发等同志的精神，完成伟大革命事业。代表们回到各人的岗位以后，必须用最大的决心，用灵活的方法来完成大会给我们的各项任务；当我们每一个人都尽到了我们应尽的力量的时候，我们的彻底解放就很快能达到目的了。”
    最后他代表大会向中共中央、国内国外工人阶级和民主团体以及东北解放区党政军民各机关团体给予劳大的各种精神鼓励与物资慰劳，表示感谢。
