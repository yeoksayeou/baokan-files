Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th. In the battle to annihilate the enemy's 36th Division, the Northwest People's Liberation Army artillery excelled in coordinating with the infantry, using a high hit rate to destroy the enemy's star-studded defense system in the foothills of Huanglong Mountain, which was built using the complex natural terrain, ensuring the victory of the battle. At 4:00 PM on the 8th, when we launched a general attack on Hutishan, the pivotal point of the entire battle, the artillerymen, after aiming and test-firing the first shot, hit the strong fortress on the mountain ridge—the Great Temple—with the second shot, destroying the enemy's mountain artillery position. They then turned to bombard the top of the temple, covering the infantry's smooth capture of Hutishan. When attacking the enemy's stronghold south of Fengyuan Town, under the cover of our valiant artillery, the 7th company of infantry captured the first bunker without a single casualty. And the 3rd and 6th companies captured two bunkers in succession in less than an hour, with enemy-own casualties at a ratio of seven to one. The infantrymen wrote letters praising the artillery units, and sang their own composed song: "Artillerymen, you're the best! Aiming at the enemy's tortoise nest, every shot hits the mark, covering the infantry to charge forward, charging towards the enemy's position like a gust of wind."
