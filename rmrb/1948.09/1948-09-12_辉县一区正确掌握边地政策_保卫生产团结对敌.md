【Taihang Telegram】Huixian First District (Chengguan), after we stopped land reform, corrected policies, and launched a mass struggle to defend production and unite against the enemy, has now transformed from a no-man's land into an advancing position for fighting the enemy and has greatly strengthened the people's armed self-defense forces. The district originally had ten administrative villages that were border areas, with the furthest village being no more than eight li away from the enemy, and they were frequently attacked by the enemy. Since last June and July, due to the influence of our emphasis on mass relocation and indiscriminate struggle, coupled with the destruction by the enemy and the threat of military offensives, a large number of landlords, rich peasants, and middle peasants fled to enemy-controlled areas. Of the more than 9,000 people in the ten border villages, more than 4,600 fled. The most serious case was in Jiushengying, where 1,200 out of 1,900 people fled, leaving only women and the elderly at home. As a result, there were more than one hundred hectares of wasteland in the entire district, and the struggle against the enemy was left to only a few militiamen who dared not stay in the villages, returning early every morning and leaving late every night. After studying this situation, our leadership stopped land reform in the area last autumn, focusing on production and combining it with policy propaganda to win back the border area masses. At that time, the biggest difficulty for the masses in the border areas was that there was no one to weed the seedlings, and they could not plant wheat on the wasteland. We seized on this demand from the masses and immediately launched two production support efforts to the border areas, mobilizing 2,000 laborers and 105 head of livestock, including 25 head from the enemy-occupied areas. They all brought their own food, and district and village cadres personally led them to the fields, combining it with propaganda. Soon, all the seedlings were weeded, and most of the wheat was planted. This greatly moved the masses in the border areas, and the fleeing households returned one after another. Nearly 600 people returned to Jiushengying village alone. About 4,000 people returned to the entire district. The morale of the masses began to stabilize, and the village militia self-defense teams also began to develop, organizing "dare-to-die" squads for the struggle against the enemy, presenting a new atmosphere. This spring, after the reorganization of cadres, we further carried out policy propaganda, resettled the fleeing households, and made extensive efforts to win them over through various relationships. Now, eight out of ten fleeing households in the entire district have returned home to engage in production. From then on, the no-man's land was eliminated. After most of the fleeing households returned, the leadership explained and rectified policies, resettling the fleeing households one after another, enabling them to quickly obtain land for cultivation, and especially promoted the policy of "whoever cultivates it, owns the harvest." Under this influence, the worries of landlords, rich peasants, and some middle peasants who were afraid of struggle and unable to focus on production were dispelled. In ×× village, after more than 90 poor peasant households distributed the land from two evil landlord households and the public land, they quickly turned to production. Four landlord and rich peasant households, including three rich peasants occupying 156 mu of land, also participated in thirteen mutual aid teams. The rich peasants also actively stood guard and patrolled, using "dare-to-die" spears to attack the enemy. The mood of unity against the enemy among all classes rose even higher. In terms of production, this year a total of more than 5,000 mu of wasteland were eliminated in the ten villages, and six villages increased their livestock by 90 head. Many poor peasants who did well in production also bought new livestock. Sixteen poor peasant households in ×× village have increased their livestock by sixteen head.

　　辉县一区正确掌握边地政策
  　保卫生产团结对敌
    【太行电】辉县一区（城关），在我停止土改，端正政策，发动了以保卫生产团结对敌的群众性斗争后，现已由无人区变为对敌斗争的前进阵地。并大大增强了人民武装自卫的力量。该区原有十个行政村是边沿区，离敌最远的村不过八里，时遭敌人袭击。去年六、七月来，由于我强调群众大转移和乱斗乱杀的影响，更加上敌人的摧残及军事进攻的威胁，大批地富以及中贫农逃往敌区，边沿十个村九千多人口即跑了四千六百多人。其中最严重的如九圣营，全村一千九百口跑了一千二百口，留在家里的只剩妇女老弱。因此全区荒地百顷以上，对敌斗争只剩少数民兵，每天晚出早归，不敢在村坚持。我领导上研究了这个情况后，于去秋便停止了当地的土改，以生产为中心结合宣传政策，争取边地群众归来。当时边沿区群众的最大困难是苗荒没人锄，荒地种不上麦子。我抓住群众这个要求，当即发动了我区和敌占区群众两次对边地的生产支援，动员了二千劳力，一百零五犋牲口，其中有敌占区群众二十五犋，支援时都是自带干粮，区村干部亲自率领上地，并结合进行宣传，很快即将荒苗全部锄完，麦子也大部种下。这一来大大的感动了边地群众，逃亡户陆续回来，九圣营一村即回来近六百人。全区回来四千人左右。群众情绪开始稳定，各村民兵自卫队也开始发展，自卫队组织起决把枪班对敌斗争，现出新的气象。今春经过干部整编，又进一步的开展政策宣传，安置逃亡户，利用各种关系大量放手进行争取。现全区十分之八的逃亡户已返家进行生产。从此无人区便消灭了。在大部逃亡户回来后，领导上又进行讲解政策，端正政策，陆续安置逃亡户，使他们迅速得到土地耕种，并特别宣传了谁种谁收的政策，在此影响下解除了地富以及一部中农怕斗争不安心生产的顾虑。××村全村九十多户贫农，在分配了二户恶霸地主和公社分地后，便很快转向了生产。四户地富其中三户富农占土地一五六亩，也分别参加了十三个互助班，富农也积极站岗放哨，拿决把枪打击敌人，各阶层一致团结对敌斗争的情绪由此更加高涨起来。生产方面，在十个村内今年共消灭荒地五千余亩，六个村增加牲口九十头。不少贫农生产搞的好，也新买了牲口。××村十六户贫农已增加牲口十六头。
