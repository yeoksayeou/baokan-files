Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. According to a communication published in the Nanjing Kuomintang Central Daily News on August 2nd by a reporter "after visiting wounded soldiers in Northern Anhui," the soldiers who sacrificed for the four families were subjected to cold neglect and abuse after being wounded. The communication stated: "In Chuxian, a wounded officer of the Parachute Corps said: A few days ago, when more than 100 of their wounded brothers were sent to Huaiyuan, they couldn't find a place to rest. Nearly 2,000 wounded soldiers from other units were sent to Huaiyuan, and no one was responsible for helping them. So more than 2,000 wounded soldiers were lying on the streets of Huaiyuan, unattended. The weather was hot, and the seriously wounded couldn't bear it, and a few died that day." As for the situation in the Kuomintang's military hospitals, the communication reported: "Medicines, nursing care, and nutritional products are all pitifully lacking." "The Sixth Hospital in Chuxian and the Fourth Hospital in Mentai can be said to be the largest hospitals in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. The two hospitals usually have more than a thousand wounded soldiers, sometimes even reaching three thousand. Their pharmacies and operating rooms are all terribly simple. Surgical equipment is still old equipment from a long time ago. Nursing care is especially out of the question. The situation in some seriously wounded wards is difficult to describe. In terms of nutrition, it is especially difficult to imagine. The daily food cost for a wounded soldier is 70,000 yuan (including firewood, oil, salt, and vegetables, in addition to rice). 70,000 yuan can only buy two fried dough sticks, how can it provide nutrition to the wounded? In addition, there is a special nutrition fee, only 60,000 yuan per person per month, which is simply a joke."

　　国民党军伤兵备受冷漠虐待
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据八月二日南京国民党中央日报刊载该报记者“访问皖北荣军之后”的通讯供认：为四大家族卖命的官兵，在受伤后备受冷漠与虐待。该通讯说：“在滁县的时候，一位伞兵总队的负伤军官说：几天前，他们一百多负伤的弟兄被送往怀远的时候，竟找不到歇脚的地方。其他部队的伤兵被送往怀远的，将近两千人，没有人负责去救助。所以二千多伤兵竟致卧倒在怀远的街上，无人过问。天气又热，重伤的受不了，当天就有少数死去的。”至于国民党的伤兵医院情形，该通讯报导：“医药、看护和营养品，全都缺乏得可怜。”“滁县的第六医院，门台子的第四医院可以说是津浦南段最大的医院，两院的伤兵平常都在一千以上，有时竟到三千。他们的药房和手术室，一切都是那样简单得可怕。手术器材还是很久以前的旧器材。看护尤其谈不到。好些重伤室，里面的情形是难于叙述。营养方面，尤其令人难于想象，一个伤兵每天的伙食费是七万元（除米以外，柴油盐菜均在内）。七万元只能买两根油条，对伤者哪里能有营养？另外有特别营养费，一个月每人只有六万元，这简直是笑话。”
