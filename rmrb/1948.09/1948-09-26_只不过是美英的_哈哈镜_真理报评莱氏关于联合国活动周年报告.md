Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 22nd: TASS reports: Pravda recently published an article entitled "Distorted Reflection Under the Guise of a Report," commenting on UN Secretary-General Lie's annual report on UN activities, which was released as the third UN General Assembly was scheduled to convene in Paris on the 21st. Pravda first pointed out: Amidst the increasingly sharp struggle between the world's democratic and anti-democratic camps, the UN has become a battleground for two kinds of foreign policy: the democratic forces, led by the Soviet Union, strive to strengthen international cooperation, peace, and democracy, thereby strengthening the UN organization; while the imperialist forces, led by the United States, are doing their utmost to pursue expansion and world hegemony, thereby undermining the principles and purposes of the UN. Unfortunately, however, Lie's report fails to correctly interpret events based on factual materials. In its general assessment of the situation, the report equates the two "conflicting trends," creating the false impression that both tendencies are undermining the UN. Pravda then cited facts to show that Lie's report, in its sections on the principle of unanimity among the great powers, on Greece, Korea, Indonesia, Palestine, and the so-called "Little Assembly," defends the U.S. and Britain's position of undermining the UN Charter and carrying out imperialist expansion. Pravda also stated: Lie's report allows for the possibility of submitting the German question to the UN General Assembly, but he knows that the formulation of a German peace treaty is solely within the purview of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Lie appears prepared to comply with the intentions of American politicians, who, because they cannot force their conditions to be accepted in the Council of Foreign Ministers on resolving the German question, have planned to "appeal" to the UN in order to achieve the goal of deceiving public opinion. The most prominent point of Lie's departure from the UN's principles and tasks is his praise of the "Marshall Plan," which, it is already completely clear, will not only cause Western European countries to lose their economic independence but also their national sovereignty. Pravda concluded: This report reflects only the situation in the "funhouse mirror" of the U.S. and Britain, who are trying to turn the UN into a tool of their foreign policy.

　　只不过是美英的“哈哈镜”
  　真理报评莱氏关于联合国活动周年报告
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社讯：真理报顷以“在报告掩盖下的歪曲反映”为题，著文评论联合国秘书长莱氏在第三届联合国大会定于二十一日在巴黎举行之际所发表的联合国活动周年报告。真理报首先指出：在世界民主阵营与反民主阵营间斗争日益尖锐之下，联合国已变成两种外交政策斗争的场所：以苏联为首的民主力量力谋加强国际合作、和平与民主，从而加强联合国组织；而以美国为首的帝国主义势力，竭力追逐扩张和世界霸权，从而破坏联合国的原则和目的。但不幸的是，莱氏报告并未根据确实的材料来正确地解释事件。该报告在其一般形势估计中，把两种“互相冲突的趋势”等量齐观，造成两种倾向都是破坏联合国的错误印象。真理报继即列举事实，说明莱氏报告在大国一致原则，在关于希腊、朝鲜、印尼、巴勒斯坦、所谓“小型大会”各节中，为美英破坏联合国宪章及进行帝国主义扩张的立场辩护。真理报又称：莱氏报告允许德国问题可能提交联合国大会，但他知道：德国和约的制订，仅仅是外长会议的权限。莱氏似乎准备遵从美国政客的意图，他们因为在外长会议中解决德国问题不能强人接受他们的条件，已打算“上诉”联合国，以达到欺骗舆论的目的。莱氏背离联合国原则与任务最突出的一点，是他对“马歇尔计划”的称读，这个计划不仅将使西欧国家失去经济独立，而且失去国家主权，这已是完全明白的事情。真理报结语称：这个报告所反映的，只是美英“哈哈镜”中的情形，后者正力图把联合国变成他们外交政策的工具。
