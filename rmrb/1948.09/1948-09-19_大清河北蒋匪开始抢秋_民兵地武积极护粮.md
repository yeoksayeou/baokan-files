　　[Jizhong Telegram] Chiang Kai-shek and Fu bandits in areas north of the Daqing River have begun grabbing autumn crops. Our military and civilians in the border areas have launched a struggle to protect autumn harvests and grain. On August 27th, bandit troops from Wang Qingtuo in western Tianjin grabbed many carts and seized whichever ripe crops they found in the fields. The six pseudo-major townships of Xin'an, Tang'erli (both belonging to Baxian County), Dongduan, Cecheng, Donggugang, and Deshengkou (all belonging to Jinwu County) have recently formed the "Six Great Joint Townships" in order to sabotage our region's autumn harvest and plunder grain. The Dongduan pseudo-major township even forced each village to establish a "Field Protection Association." If a family's crops ripened, they had to first obtain a "Harvest Permit" from the "Field Protection Association" before being allowed to harvest. At the beginning of the harvest, they also had to hand over eight catties of "green grain" per mu. The Taohe (belonging to Jinwu County) pseudo-major township forced each household to hand over twelve catties of "green grain" in advance. In addition, they demanded large quantities of grain from various villages. The Dongduan pseudo-major township demanded more than 12,000 catties from its own village in one instance. The Wuqing pseudo-county government extorted "compensation grain" from the villages (because the bandits lost the county town and grain in July, they made the masses compensate), at thirteen catties per mu. Chiang bandits in various places also arrested people and seized livestock on a large scale, forcing the masses to compensate with grain. In Zhangfang Village (Jinwu County), with just over twenty households, eight people were arrested and eight mules were seized. Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Anci County also constantly arrested people and seized grain in villages in the fifth and sixth districts of the county. On September 2nd and 3rd, two regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Baoding went to Da Hou Village and Xiao Hou Village in Anxin County to grab crops and disrupt the people's autumn harvest. In order to smash the Chiang bandits' conspiracy to grab autumn crops and grain, border villages in Jinwu, Qingyuan and other places are actively organizing armed forces, implementing the integration of labor and military affairs, and defending the autumn harvest. Local armed forces, militia, and work teams are also actively conducting grain protection and autumn harvest protection struggles. In August, according to incomplete statistics, our local armed forces, militia, and work teams north of the Daqing River fought a total of sixty-seven battles, annihilating more than 320 enemies, seizing five machine guns, 138 rifles and pistols, more than 3,300 rounds of ammunition, and other items. At present, local armed forces and militia in various places are continuing to carry out the struggle to protect the autumn harvest.

　　大清河北蒋匪开始抢秋
  　民兵地武积极护粮
    【冀中电】大清河北等地蒋傅匪开始抢秋，我边缘区军民已展开护秋护粮斗争。津西王庆坨匪军于八月二十七日抓了很多大车，到地里见哪块庄稼熟了就抢那块。信安、堂二里（以上属霸县）、东段、策城、东沽港、得胜口（以上属津武）等六个伪大乡，为了破坏我区秋收，抢掠粮食，最近编成了“六大联乡”。东段伪大乡并强迫各村成立“护田会”，谁家庄稼熟了一定先在“护田会”里领取“收割证”，才许收割。在开始收割时，一亩地还得先交八斤“青粮”，陶河（津武属）伪大乡强令群众每户先交十二斤“青粮”。此外，还大批向各村要粮。东段伪大乡向本村一次要一万二千多斤，武清伪县府向各村勒要“赔偿粮”（伪匪七月份丢了县城丢了粮食，叫群众赔），每亩十三斤。各地蒋匪并大肆抓人、抢牲口，强迫群众用粮食赔。二十多户的张坊村（津武）被抓走八个人，抢去八个骡子。安次匪军也不断在该县五、六区一带村抓人抢粮。保定蒋匪两个团于九月二、三两日到安新大侯村、小侯村一带抢庄稼，破坏人民秋收。为粉碎蒋匪抢秋抢粮阴谋，津武、清苑等地边缘村庄正积极组织武装，实行劳武结合，保卫秋收。各地地武民兵武工队也积极活动，进行护粮护秋斗争。八月份中，据不完全统计，我大清河北地武、民兵、武工队共作战六十七次，歼敌三百二十余名，缴机枪五挺，长短枪一百三十八支，子弹三千三百余发，其他物品一部。现各地地武民兵仍在继续进行护秋斗争。
