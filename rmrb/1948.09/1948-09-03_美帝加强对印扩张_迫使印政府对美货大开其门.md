Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 31st: American imperialism is strengthening its expansion into India. According to TASS, New Delhi, August 24th: After "visiting" Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, U.S. Navy Admiral Connolly has gone to Delhi, the capital of India, accompanied by senior officials from the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force. At the same time, the U.S. naval fleet led by Connolly has also arrived in Bombay. The Delhi press believes that the "visit" of U.S. officials is related to the conclusion of the "Friendly Trade and Navigation" treaty between India and the United States and the large-scale loans that the United States is about to grant to India. Nehru told United Press reporters on August 14: "We hope to sign contracts with American companies to develop Indian industry." An August 9th dispatch from the Telecommunications Agency stated that the new U.S. Ambassador to India, Henderson, who had just taken office to strengthen U.S.-Indian relations, notified the U.S. Department of Commerce and the State Department that he was "seeking" "opportunities" for American companies to invest in Indian manganese mining companies. As early as July 6, the Indian Information Office had revealed that the United States was forcing the Indian government to open its doors wide to American goods. A dispatch from the Indian Information Office stated: "In accordance with the provisional agreement on tariffs and trade signed in New York on June 8, the Indian government has ordered that, starting from July 8, tariff concessions be implemented to reduce the tax rates on 59 imported goods."

　　美帝加强对印扩张
  　迫使印政府对美货大开其门
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】美帝国主义正加强对印度的扩张。据塔斯社新德里二十四日讯：美国海军上将康诺利于“访问”巴基斯坦首府喀拉蚩后，已前往印度首府德里，随行者有美国海陆空军高级官员多人。同时，由康诺利率领的美海军舰队亦抵达孟买。德里新闻界相信，美国官员“访问”之举，系与缔结印美“友好贸易航海”条约及美国行将对印大批贷款有关。尼赫鲁曾于八月十四日向合众社记者称：“我们希望与美国公司订立合同，以开发印度工业”。电通社九日的电讯称，为了加强美印关系而新赴任的美驻印大使韩德逊，通知美商务部及国务院称，他正在“寻觅”美国公司投资印度锰矿公司的“机会”。早在七月六日，印度新闻处即已透露美国正迫使印度政府对美货大开其门。印度新闻处电讯称：“印度政府依照六月八日在纽约签订的关税及贸易临时协定，已下令自七月八日起，实施关税特许办法，减低五十九种进口货的税率。”
