Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st—Recently in Harbin City, a small number of industrial and commercial owners have openly violated laws and regulations, illegally seeking profits, and even using the excuse of developing production to oppress workers and apprentices. The municipal government has punished them separately according to the law. This kind of handling by the government has attracted the attention of all relevant parties, who believe that it is very necessary to correctly implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and developing production.

The managers of the Tianzhucheng Iron Factory, Hu Jinyin and Cao Zhijun, constantly beat and scolded workers, and used feudal methods such as forcing apprentices to kneel to oppress them, extending working hours to as long as eighteen hours without paying overtime. Sui Yingsan, the manager of the Zhenxingxiang Iron Factory, arbitrarily mistreated apprentices, extending working hours to fourteen hours. Yu Li, the female owner of Yongxing Furnace, was dissatisfied with worker Xu Xuewen's learning, and scolded him. When Xu questioned her, Li used a wooden stick to injure Xu's face. Ma Guoliang, the director of the Dongxing Clothing Factory, contracted to dismantle and wash 400 cotton coats for the Northeast Military Supply Department. Ma ordered the workers to use two liang less cotton per coat, stealing a total of eighty jin of cotton. The factory also contracted to produce more than 500 sets of uniforms for workers at the Dongsheng Textile Factory. Ma personally cut the fabric, stealing more than 170 chi of cloth. At the same time, the factory extended production time to sixteen hours a day and deliberately delayed wage payments, using the wages for speculative business. The above incidents were exposed by the trade union, and the district government, trade union, military supply bureau, industry and commerce bureau, and both labor and capital were invited to a meeting to discuss them. Ma still stubbornly defended himself, so the trade union filed a lawsuit with the court. After the Harbin Municipal Court tried and confirmed the above-mentioned illegal acts of the above-mentioned owners, they were sentenced to detention for one to two months, and Ma Guoliang was sentenced to return the stolen cotton and cloth to the original owners.

Furthermore, in June, Guo Jinyin, the director of the Jinji Shoe Factory in the city, made 10,000 pairs of "Ula" (shoes made of Ula grass, which are very warm) for the Songjiang Forestry Bureau. Both parties agreed on the weight of the "Ula," but Guo ordered the workers to brush syrup on the leather to make up the weight, and it was still not up to standard. The factory also used inferior cloth to replace the fabric when making military shoes for the Liaobei Military Region. The above two points were exposed by the factory's workers and confirmed by the court's investigation. The court held that the factory owner had harmed military production and illegally sought profits, and should have been sentenced to imprisonment. However, considering that this was his first offense, the punishment was reduced, and he was fined 20 million yuan. In addition, some factory owners in the clothing and military shoe industries in Daoli District and Xinyang District of Harbin City also had behaviors such as delaying or deducting wages, unreasonably dismissing workers, and cutting corners. After being discovered by the joint association of the clothing and shoe industries in the two districts, in order to implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and establish correct labor-capital relations, worker representatives were sent to negotiate with the factory owners separately. After both parties debated, and with the on-site witnessing of all relevant parties, the factory owners admitted their mistakes due to their unreasonableness, and returned the deducted wages in kind.

　　哈市少数工商业主
  　偷工减料虐待工人
    【新华社东北二十一日电】哈尔滨市最近有少数工商业主公然违反法令，非法牟利，甚至借口发展生产，压迫工人学徒。该市政府已依法分别予以惩处。政府此种处置已引起各有关方面的重视，认为对正确地贯彻劳资两利，发展生产的方针是非常必要的。
    该市天祝成铁工厂经理胡金印、曹志钧，曾不断打骂工人，并用罚跪等封建办法欺压学徒，工作时间竟延长至十八小时，不给加班费。振兴祥铁工厂经理隋英三随意虐待学徒，延长工作时间至十四小时。永兴炉女掌柜于李氏不满工人许学文学习，出口大骂，许质问时，李氏即用木棒将许之面部打伤。东兴被服厂厂长马国良，承包拆洗东北军需处棉大衣四百件，马竟令工友每件少絮二两，从中偷花八十斤。该厂又承制东生纺织厂工人制服五百余套，经马亲自剪裁，偷布一百七十余尺。同时该厂生产时间每日延长至十六小时，故意迟发工资，将工资做投机生意。以上各节，经工会揭发，并邀请区政府、职工会、军需局、工商局及劳资双方开会讨论，而马仍强词狡辩，工会乃向法院起诉。上述各事件均经哈市法院审讯证实上述业主各项非法行为后，分别判处各该业主拘役一至两月，并判马国良将偷减的棉花与布料退还原主。
    又讯：该市金记鞋厂厂长郭金印六月间为松江林务局做“乌拉”一万双（以乌拉草做的鞋，很温暖），双方订定“乌拉”重量，而郭竟令工人于皮上刷糖稀顶重量，且仍不够标准。该厂为辽北军区包作军鞋店，亦用劣布顶换。以上两节经该厂工人揭发，并经法院调查证实。法院以该厂主如此妨害军需生产，非法牟利，本应判处徒刑，但姑念其尚属初犯，减轻处分，罚款两千万元。此外，哈市道里区、新阳区被服军鞋业，亦有些厂主缓发或克扣工资，无理解雇工人和偷工减料等行为。经两区被服及鞋业联合会发现后，为贯彻劳资两利方针，建立劳资正确关系，乃派工人代表分别与厂方进行交涉。经双方辩论，并请各有关方面当场见证，厂方以理曲，承认错误后并将克扣工资折合实物赔还人。
