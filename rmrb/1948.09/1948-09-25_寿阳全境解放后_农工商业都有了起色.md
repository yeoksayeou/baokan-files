　　After the Liberation of Shouyang

  　Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce All Improved
    [Jinzhong News] Most areas of Shouyang were long occupied by the Japanese invaders. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they were invaded again by the Yan bandit army. Under their tyrannical rule, industry and commerce were almost completely destroyed. All eleven well-known market towns in the county, such as Zong'ai and Jiechou, were also destroyed. In the hundred or so villages under the Yan bandit's "integration of soldiers and farmers," most of the young and middle-aged people were forced into the army. After the Zhengtai Campaign, the Yan bandits created large areas of no-man's land, leaving vast areas of rural land barren. It is estimated that the county has more than 187,000 mu of wasteland, accounting for more than a quarter of the total land area. The grain harvested in the cultivated areas was also forcibly requisitioned and plundered by the Yan bandits, causing a serious disaster in Shouyang, which was known as a grain-producing area. According to partial statistics from six districts, the disaster victims who have nothing to eat currently account for an average of about 20% of the population in these six districts. During the Jinzhong Campaign, the entire territory of the county was liberated. The north and south Shouyang, which had been divided by the Yan bandits, announced their unification and merger on the seventh of last month. After investigation and understanding, our democratic government quickly carried out disaster relief and resumed and developed production. In terms of disaster relief, 200 shi of relief grain were distributed at the beginning of this month. On the 10th of this month, the county party committee organized a work group of 22 people, including office cadres, led by Zhang Cuisan, secretary of the county party committee, to organize mass production in the newly liberated disaster areas. In terms of production, they are actively preparing to eliminate wasteland, accumulate fertilizer, and plant wheat. It is planned that each person in the old and semi-old areas will plant 2.5 mu of wheat, and each person in the new area will plant 1 mu of wheat. The shortage of 1,759 shi of wheat seeds will be solved by the county for 520 shi, and the rest will be solved by mobilizing social mutual assistance. In order to stabilize the masses' production mood, it was also announced that the land reform will not be carried out in areas where the Yan bandit's "integration of soldiers and farmers" had been implemented, nor will rent and interest reduction be implemented, but land adjustment will be implemented, with a 30/70 split. At present, all districts are actively carrying out production recovery. The fifth district is making a concentrated effort to cut artemisia and compost fertilizer in preparation for planting wheat. In ten days, 28 villages in the district have cut more than 500,000 jin. The decision to eliminate wasteland is to have each able-bodied laborer reclaim 2 mu of wasteland and each livestock labor reclaim 5 mu of wasteland. In terms of industry and commerce, after the government conducted in-depth publicity on the war situation and explained industrial and commercial policies, it first adjusted the city's housing, deciding that the houses should be returned to their original owners. For some merchants' old stock of American and Chiang goods, free trade was allowed and no more taxes were levied, and loans of more than 3 million yuan were issued. Under this correct grasp of policies and practical support, the commerce in Shoucheng has developed from the more than 60 households restored when it was first liberated to 150 stores of all sizes in just over 20 days, with all kinds of daily necessities such as agricultural tools and printed cloth available, and the market is gradually prospering. Nine of the original eleven market towns have reopened. In Zong'ai town, the number of businesses has grown to 157 households, and the market is very crowded. Workshops have also begun to be built. In the industrial and mining industry, the bowl kiln in Duanwang town has been repaired and is shipping goods, and the coal kilns in the Huangdangou area have been put into operation one after another.
