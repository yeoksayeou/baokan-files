Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 24th: TASS reports: The Finnish Communist Party's newspaper "Työkansan Sanomat" recently published an editorial exposing the increasingly reactionary nature of the Social Democratic cabinet headed by Fagerholm. The editorial stated: "The activities of the Fagerholm cabinet prove that the Communist Party's assessment of this cabinet was justified from the very first day of its formation. Now, everyone can see that the Fagerholm government's task is to pave the way for reactionaries, and it is carrying out the will of the capitalists." The editorial summarized the government's reactionary activities during this period, stating: it is protecting capitalists from obtaining illegal profits from the manufacture of reparations goods; it is dismissing civil servants with democratic ideas and squeezing out democratic elements in the police agencies; it claims to be friendly to the Soviet Union, but this "friendship" was initially demonstrated by the release of the convicted war criminal Kivimäki. According to TASS, citing the French weekly "Action": Fagerholm held extremely secret talks with the US Ambassador to Finland, Warren, last month. The United States will lend Finland $150 million on the condition that Finland effectively participates in the Marshall Plan. It is said that Fagerholm has accepted this condition. As early as the beginning of August, shortly after the formation of the Fagerholm cabinet, Ms. Kuusinen, Chairman of the Finnish People's Democratic Union parliamentary group, analyzed this right-wing Social Democratic government, stating: "Governments like this around the world represent a transition to a completely reactionary stage." However, she also pointed out with confidence: The People's Democratic Union "will be able to rely on our supporters even more in the future than today. The false victory of the reactionary elections and the accompanying fraudulent gambling have opened the people's eyes to the current situation."

　　芬共报纸发表社论
  　揭露政府日趋反动
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社讯：芬兰共产党机关报“杜坎森·杉诺玛”报顷发表社论，揭露以法吉荷尔姆为首的社会民主党内阁日趋反动。社论称：“法吉荷尔姆内阁的活动，证明了共产党对这一内阁的估计从其组成的第一天起就是有根据的。现在，每个人都可以看出，法吉荷尔姆政府的任务，就在为反动分子铺平道路，而且它正在执行资本家们的意旨。”社论总结政府这一时期的反动活动称：它正包庇资本家从制造赔偿货物中获取非法利润；它正辞退有民主思想的公务员，并排挤警察机关中的民主分子；它扬言对苏联友好，但这种“友好”一开始就表现为开释已判决的战犯基维马基。另据塔斯社引法国“行动”周刊消息：法吉荷尔姆曾于上月与美国驻芬大使瓦伦举行了极端秘密的谈判。美国将贷与芬兰一亿五千万美元，而以芬兰在事实上参加马歇尔计划为条件，据说，法吉荷尔姆已接受了这一条件。早在八月初，即法吉荷尔姆内阁组成后不久，芬兰人民民主联盟国会党团主席库西宁女士即分析过这个右翼社会民主党的政府称：“全世界这样的政府都代表着一个过渡到完全反动的阶段”。但她也满怀信心地指出：人民民主联盟“在将来甚至比今天更能依靠我们的拥护者。反动派选举的假胜利以及随之而来的欺诈的赌博，已使人民睁开眼睛，认识了当前的局势。”
