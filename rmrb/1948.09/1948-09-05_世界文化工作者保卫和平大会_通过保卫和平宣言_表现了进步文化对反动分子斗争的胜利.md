Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st - Reports from all sources: The World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace, attended by representatives from 46 countries, opened on August 25th in Wrocław (formerly German Breslau), western Poland. On the first day, the congress unanimously elected six people to the presidium: France's Curie, Soviet Union's Fadeyev, Britain's Huxley, Poland's Bolesław, Italy's Guttuso, and Denmark's Norregaard. Chairman Curie then announced the congress agenda as follows: 1. Fadeyev's report: Science and culture in the struggle for peace, progress, and democracy. 2. Stapleton's report on peace and culture. 3. Harasimowicz's report: On the freedom of national cultures. 4. Belyayev's report: On international cultural cooperation. After listening to the above four reports and a recorded message from Wallace to the congress, the congress began a heated discussion. Huxley and Taylor, the head of the British delegation, under the instruction of the British Foreign Office, attempted to sabotage the congress and waited for an opportunity to withdraw. In the August 27th congress discussion, Huxley and Taylor launched attacks against Fadeyev's report. Taylor even vigorously defended the Marshall Plan in his speech, praising it for "saving the whole world." Taylor's speech was met with a powerful rebuttal from Soviet representative Ehrenburg. Ehrenburg's fiery speech repeatedly won thunderous applause from the audience. He denounced the war-mongers' slogan of "defending Western culture." He said: "All culture is threatened by the pseudo-civilization engaged in an anti-European crusade." Brazilian writer Amado, Italian representative D'Onini, and Spanish representative and former Republican Prime Minister Giral all emphasized the anti-people essence of the so-called "culture" of imperialism, and condemned the cultural figures who sold themselves to American imperialism. American representative Rocky claimed: "The British people who support Roosevelt's policies have not changed," and pointed out that Wallace's Progressive Party is increasingly increasing its influence in the struggle against American fascist protectors. The congress delegates listened with great interest to the speeches of representatives from colonial and dependent countries and decided to stand with the people of all countries fighting for independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd - The World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace, which began on August 25th in Wrocław, concluded on August 28th. Amidst thunderous cheers and applause, the congress passed the Declaration in Defense of Peace by an overwhelming majority. Only 16 votes from the US and British delegations (a total of 74 votes) opposed or abstained, and one vote from the Brazilian delegation abstained. The declaration first pointed out that human culture is facing a major threat. The culture of European countries, which have made significant contributions to the treasure trove of human culture, is in danger of losing its national characteristics and becoming a fascist slave. Science is being used by war instigators for the purpose of destruction. It advocates: the free development and dissemination of the achievements of progressive culture, mutual understanding between cultures and nations, and the application of science to reduce the poverty, ignorance, disease, and deprivation of the majority of mankind. The declaration pointed out that the people of the world have enough strength to defend peace and culture, and to oppose all attempts at neo-fascism, and called on intellectuals to fight for the above purposes. The declaration finally suggested: all countries should convene national congresses of cultural workers in defense of peace, establish national committees in defense of peace, and strengthen the international connections of cultural workers in all countries for the benefit of peace. The congress decided to establish an International Liaison Committee in Paris, with Soviet Fadeyev (famous writer), Fedoseyev, American Robeson (famous black singer), Fiest (editor of the American "Mainstream" magazine), Chilean Neruda (famous poet), French Aragon (famous poet), Madame Curie (famous physicist), Republican Spanish Giral (former prime minister, political commentator), and Polish Dąbrowski as members. Before the closing ceremony, the congress continued its debate. Hayden, a famous British scientist and popularizer of science, stated: "We must resist the reactionary elements' attempt to divide culture into so-called Western culture and Eastern culture. We must block the spread of promises and slanders about the Soviet Union." He pointed out: "The threat of a new war comes from the US imperialist bloc." The speeches of some British and American representatives, especially the speech of Huxley, the head of the British delegation who had attempted to slander the Soviet Union, aroused widespread indignation. Soviet representative Zaslavsky rebutted such speeches, and he denounced the persecution of intellectuals in certain countries. Zaslavsky called: "I wish that all of us will unite in our hatred of imperialism, fascism, and war-mongers. We believe in peace and friendship among all peoples, and will strive to achieve it."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd - TASS News: Viktorov, an observer of Pravda, recently wrote an article commenting on the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace, saying: The World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace, held in Wrocław, Poland, has rightfully attracted the attention of all freedom-loving people. The representatives attending the congress exposed the reactionary plans of American imperialists at home and abroad. This feverish activity of the imperialist camp does not indicate their strength, but rather their weakness. The forces of democracy have greatly surpassed the forces of reaction. However, one must not conclude from this that one can take a passive attitude towards the plans of war-mongers and demagogues who poison the minds of the people. No, a thousand times no! Cultural workers must actively fight against reactionaries, fascism, and new wars. The Wrocław Congress is an event of international significance. It vividly demonstrates the unity of democratic forces throughout the world and the will of the people of all countries to demand peace and fight for peace.

    【新华社陕北三日电】自八月二十五日起在罗克劳城举行的世界文化工作者保卫和平大会已于二十八日宣告闭幕。大会在雷动的欢呼与掌声中以绝大多数通过了保卫和平宣言，仅美英两国代表团（共七十四票）中，有十六票反对与弃权，巴西代表团有一票弃权。宣言首先指陈人类文化正面临重大威胁，对人类文化宝库曾有重大贡献的欧洲各国，其文化正处于丧失民族特性而沦为法西斯奴仆的危险境遇中，科学正被战争挑拨者用于毁灭的目的，并主张：自由发展与传布进步文化之成就、文化间与民族间的相互谅解、科学应用于减少大多数人类的贫困、愚昧、疾病与匮乏。宣言指出：世界人民具有足够力量来保卫和平与文化，而反对新法西斯主义的各种企图，并呼吁知识分子为上述目的而奋斗。宣言最后建议：一切国家召开全国文化工作者保卫和平大会，成立保卫和平全国委员会，并为和平的利益而加强一切国家文化工作者的国际联系。大会决定在巴黎设立国际联络委员会，由苏联法捷耶夫（名作家）、菲多塞夫，美国罗伯逊（黑人歌王）、费斯特（美国“主流”杂志编辑），智利尼鲁达（名诗人），法国阿拉贡（名诗人）、居里女士（名物理学家），共和西班牙吉拉尔（前总理、政论家），波兰董布罗夫斯基任委员。闭幕之前，大会继续辩论。英国著名科学家与通俗化工作者海登声称：“我们必须对抗反动分子划分文化为所谓西方文化与东方文化的企图，我们必须阻塞关于苏联的诺言与诽谤之散布”。他指出：“新战争的威胁是来自美帝国主义集团”。若干英美代表，特别是曾企图诋毁苏联的英国代表团长赫胥黎的演讲，激起了普遍的愤慨。苏联代表萨斯拉夫斯基曾对这种演讲予以反击，他痛斥某些国家之迫害知识分子。萨氏呼吁：“我愿我们大家将在我们对帝国主义、法西斯主义与战争贩子的憎恨中团结起来。我们相信和平与各国人民的友谊，并将奋力以求。”
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社讯：真理报观察家维克托罗夫顷撰文评论世界文化工作者保卫和平大会称：在波兰罗克劳城举行的世界文化工作者保卫和平大会，已正当地引起了一切爱好自由人民的注意。出席大会的代表们揭露了美帝国主义者在国内外的反动计划。帝国主义阵营这种热病似的活动不是说明他们强大，而是说明他们衰弱。民主力量已大大超过了反动力量。但是，决不能就此得出结论，认为可以对毒害人民心灵的战争贩子与愚民主义者计划，抱消极态度。不能，一千个不能！文化工作者要积极进行战斗，反对反动派、法西斯主义和新战争。罗克劳大会是具有国际意义的事件，它生动地证明了全世界民主力量的团结与各国人民要求和平与为和平而斗争的意志。
