　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. TASS reports: The people of the Soviet Union mourn Zhdanov nationwide. When the radio broadcast the sad news on the evening of the 31st, sorrow enveloped the entire country. Upon hearing the news, many people were moved to tears. Black-bordered mourning flags were raised or flown at half-mast across the country to express grief. Newspapers devoted entire pages to publishing the obituary of Zhdanov and condolences from across the country and around the world. That evening, workers and farmers in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Kalinin, Gorky, and other places held memorial services. The depth of the grief of the people of Leningrad cannot be expressed in words. During the most difficult years of the anti-fascist war, under the leadership of Zhdanov, they fought to the death against the German invaders who besieged Leningrad and repelled the enemy. Everything here reminds people of Zhdanov's inexhaustible Bolshevik energy and historically significant contributions. In Gorky City, where Zhdanov led for more than ten years, workers at memorial services recalled Zhdanov's past work, pointing out that many districts were built under his guidance, and that he personally laid the first cornerstone of the Molotov Automobile Factory. At a memorial service at the "Red Proletarian" factory in Moscow, retired soldier and worker Dmitry Shmief stated in his speech: "All the workers of our factory and the entire working class must compensate for this loss. We must unite more closely around the Party and Comrade Stalin." Academician Vavilov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, wrote in Pravda that the death of Zhdanov was a loss to the Soviet intellectual community and the world's progressive cultural circles, who had lost an outstanding theorist of the new Soviet culture. Soviet scientists deeply felt the grief. Zhdanov's understanding of the spirit of Soviet science as a whole and the characteristics of its various departments was particularly clear. Our scientists and scientific institutions have received instructions, suggestions, and the most thorough discussions from Zhdanov on all important principles related to the essence and organization of science. It is the responsibility of our scientists to always clearly remember Zhdanov.

　　苏联全国人民痛悼日丹诺夫
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社讯：苏联全国人民痛悼日丹诺夫之丧。当无线电于三十一日晚间播出噩耗之时，哀思即笼罩全国，人民闻讯，多热泪盈眶，各地均升起镶有黑边之丧旗或悬半旗志哀，报纸则均以整版篇幅刊载日丹诺夫逝世的公报与来自全国全世界各地的唁电。当晚，莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、加里宁、高尔基等地工人农民即纷纷举行追悼会。列宁格勒人民哀痛之深，非言语所可表达。因他们曾在反法西斯战争最艰苦年月中，在日丹诺夫领导下，与包围列宁格勒的德寇作殊死战，并击退了敌人。此地每一事物都使人回想到日丹诺夫无穷尽的布尔什维克的精力和永垂史册的功勋。在日丹诺夫领导了十多年的高尔基城，工人在追悼会上，回忆日丹诺夫过去的工作，提出许多个区都是在他指导下建筑起来的，莫洛托夫汽车工厂的第一块基石是他亲手奠立的。莫斯科“红色无产阶级”工厂追悼大会上，退伍军人工人德米特里希密夫在演讲时指出：“我们工厂全体工人与整个工人阶级必须把这个损失补偿起来，我们必须更亲密地团结在党和斯大林同志周围。”苏联科学院院长瓦维洛夫在真理报著文称：日丹诺夫之死，使苏维埃知识界和世界进步文化界丧失了苏维埃新文化杰出的理论家，苏联科学家深感哀痛。日丹诺夫对于整个苏维埃科学的精神及其各个部门的特性的了解，具有特出的明确性。我们的科学家和科学机关在有关科学之本质和组织的一切重要原则问题上，都得到日丹诺夫的指示、建议和最透彻的论述，我们科学家的责任就是永远清晰地记忆着日丹诺夫。
