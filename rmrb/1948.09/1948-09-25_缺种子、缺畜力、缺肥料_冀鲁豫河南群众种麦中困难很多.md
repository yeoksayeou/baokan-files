　　Lack of Seeds, Livestock, and Fertilizer
　　Many Difficulties Faced by the Masses in Planting Wheat in Hebei, Shandong, Henan

　　[Hebei, Shandong, Henan Dispatch] Currently, the autumn harvest on the south bank of the Yellow River is coming to an end, and people are plowing the land to prepare for wheat planting. Xinhua News Agency reporters visited twenty-one poor farmers in Qinliuzhuang in the second district and Dalizhuang in the sixth district of Chengwuxian County, which had undergone preliminary land reform. They reported that there are still many difficulties that cannot be resolved in this year's wheat planting. The most important are: (1) Everyone generally lacks wheat seeds. For example, Qinliuzhuang poor farmer Wang Xintian and his wife used to have more than two mu of land. During the land reform, they were allocated two mu. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits swept through in the spring of this year, all their grain was looted by the enemy. At that time, in addition to borrowing some grain, they harvested and ate a lot of wheat before it was ripe. After threshing the wheat, paying public grain and settling debts, they only had more than 30 jin left, and they finished eating it before the sorghum was ripe. Now he doesn't even have a single wheat seed. (2) Lack of livestock. Some used to have livestock, but after repeated seesaw battles and sweeps, they were robbed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. They said, "We'll wait until those who have livestock have planted before we talk." Due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' looting, the problem of manpower, livestock, and seeds are all difficult problems for the masses in various counties of Henan this year. It is hoped that local governments will pay attention to solving them as soon as possible. Also: Correspondent Zhang Jiexu wrote that the masses in Liuguan Yan Village, Nanhe County, have great difficulties in planting wheat. Most of the masses want to plant wheat, but they don't have manure. Planting one mu of wheat yields one dou and twenty-eight sheng, which is not as good as planting sorghum next year. In the past, those who applied more manure could harvest seven or eight dou of wheat per mu; this year, the best wheat in the whole village only yielded two dou, and the land that was not fertilized yielded only nine sheng. The main reason is that too little fertilizer was applied. If three or forty jin of bean cake could be applied to one mu of land, then three to five dou of wheat could be harvested. In addition, there are more than 30 mu of wasteland in this village, which is sandy land. If wheat is planted and there is no hail, it will yield more than other land. It is not difficult to get one cloth bag of wheat per mu. However, because there are no wheat seeds, no one is planting this wasteland. Because if there is hail, the wheat seeds will be wasted. Zhang Jiexu suggested that the government should lend four or five dou of wheat seeds to plant this land. The leadership should find ways to lead the masses to solve the difficulties of fertilizer and wheat seeds.

　　缺种子、缺畜力、缺肥料
  　冀鲁豫河南群众种麦中困难很多
    【冀鲁豫电】目前黄河南岸秋收将要结束，正犁地，准备种麦。新华分社记者在城武县初步经过土改的二区秦刘庄、六区大李庄访问了二十一个贫农，他们反映，今年种麦仍有不少困难没法解决。最主要的是：（一）大家普遍的没有麦种。如秦刘庄贫农王新田老俩口，从前有二亩多地，土改中分了二亩，今年春天蒋匪扫荡时，所有的粮食全被敌人抢去，当时他除借了一部粮食外，麦子不熟就割来吃了很多；打麦后交公粮还帐，只剩了三十多斤，没等高粱熟就吃完了。现在他连一颗麦种也没有。（二）缺乏畜力。有的以前有牲口，经过屡次拉锯扫荡，被蒋匪抢去了。他们说：“等人家有牲口的种上后咱再说。”由于蒋匪的抢掠，河南各县群众在今年种麦上人畜力和种子都是困难问题，希各地政府及早注意解决。又：通讯员张阶顼来信说，南和县刘贯岩村群众种麦很困难。群众多数想种麦子，但没有粪，种麦子一亩，收斗二八升，不如明年种高粱。从前有的上粪多，一亩地有收七、八斗麦的；今年全村最好的麦子只收二斗，不上粪的地还有收九升的。主要是上的粪少。一亩地如能上三、四十斤豆饼，即能收麦子三斗至五斗。另外这村有三十多亩荒地，是沙河地，如种上麦子飙不打的话，比别的地收的还多，一亩弄一布袋麦子不难。可是没有麦种，谁也不种这荒地。因为如果飙打了，就搭了麦种。张阶顼提出意见，由政府贷四、五斗麦种，把这地种上。领导上应设法领导群众解决肥料及麦种困难。
