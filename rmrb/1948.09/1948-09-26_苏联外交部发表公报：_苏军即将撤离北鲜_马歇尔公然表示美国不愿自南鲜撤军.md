Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS, Moscow, 19th: The Soviet Foreign Ministry has issued the following communiqué regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Korea: On September 10th, the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea passed an appeal to the governments of the Soviet Union and the United States, requesting the simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea. The appeal stated that the establishment of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea and the formation of a unified Korean government by representatives of different political persuasions from North and South Korea, representing the will of the vast majority of the Korean people, is a guarantee that complete order and public tranquility will be maintained throughout Korea during and after the withdrawal of foreign troops. It is well known that after defeating the Japanese Kwantung Army in the autumn of 1945, Soviet troops liberated Korea from the Japanese aggressors and, in accordance with agreements between the Allies, remained in Korea north of the 38th parallel, while American troops remained in Korea south of the 38th parallel. The presence of Soviet troops in the territory of North Korea has provided the Korean people with ample opportunity to establish democratic administrative institutions and has provided friendly assistance to the regeneration of the Korean nation. The number of Soviet troops in North Korea has gradually decreased. In September 1947, the Soviet government proposed to the United States government the simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea, and subsequently reiterated its readiness to immediately withdraw Soviet troops from North Korea, provided that the United States government simultaneously withdraw American troops from South Korea. However, the United States government has not yet agreed to this. The Soviet government has reported the issue of the simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea, as proposed by the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The Presidium, having considered the aforementioned appeal of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, recognizes that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea is timely and expresses the hope that the United States government will also agree to withdraw American troops from South Korea, as requested by the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea. In accordance with the decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union hereby resolves: (1) to withdraw Soviet troops stationed in North Korea to Soviet territory; (2) to order the Soviet Ministry of Armed Forces to begin withdrawing Soviet troops from North Korea no later than the second half of October this year, and to complete this work by January 1, 1949.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Reports from various sources: US Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference in Washington on the 19th that the United States "does not intend to withdraw US troops from South Korea." This, at a time when the Korean People's Supreme Assembly has requested the simultaneous withdrawal of US and Soviet troops from Korea, and the Soviet Union has announced its withdrawal from North Korea, once again exposes the US imperialist conspiracy to enslave the Korean people to the condemnation of world opinion. Previously, Syngman Rhee's representative in the United States, Chen Yoh Han, catering to the wishes of his American masters, stated at a press conference in New York that even if Soviet troops withdraw from Korea, the Syngman Rhee government will request that American troops remain in Korea. Furthermore, a broadcast from Pyongyang Radio quoted by TASS on the 17th stated that an agreement had recently been concluded between the Syngman Rhee puppet government and the US occupation forces command in South Korea, stipulating that South Korean police and troops will be entirely under the command of Americans, and that the US military has not set a date for its withdrawal from Korea, but will remain in South Korea indefinitely. The broadcast also pointed out that the puppet government had already transferred coal mines and power industries to the Americans on September 10th, and that the entire economy of South Korea is now under American control. All of this proves that the transfer of eleven departments under its jurisdiction to the Syngman Rhee government by the US military government in South Korea ten days ago was the most hypocritical thing possible.

### 苏联外交部发表公报：  苏军即将撤离北鲜  马歇尔公然表示美国不愿自南鲜撤军

　　苏联外交部发表公报：
    苏军即将撤离北鲜
    马歇尔公然表示美国不愿自南鲜撤军
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科十九日电，苏联外交部发表关于苏军撤出朝鲜的公报如下：朝鲜最高人民议会九月十日通过一项致苏美两国政府的呼吁，请求苏美军队同时撤离朝鲜。呼吁声称，朝鲜最高人民议会的建立以及由此议会组成的南北朝鲜不同政治倾向的代表的统一的朝鲜政府之成立，代表南北朝鲜绝大多数人民的意志，乃是外国军队撤离朝鲜时期及其以后朝鲜全境将保有完全的秩序与公共的安宁之保证。众所周知，苏军击败日本关东军后于一九四五年秋季将朝鲜自日本侵略者手中予以解放，并遵照盟国间的协议驻留于朝鲜北纬卅八度以北之地，美军则驻留于朝鲜北纬三十八度以南之地。苏军驻留于北朝鲜的领土上，曾给予朝鲜人民以建立民主行政机构的充分机会，并对朝鲜民族的再生提供了友好的协助。北朝鲜苏军的数目逐渐减少。苏联政府曾于一九四七年九月向美国政府提议苏、美军队同时撤离朝鲜，其后并曾一再重申准备立即将苏军撤离北朝鲜，只要美国政府同时将美军撤离南朝鲜。然而美国政府对此至今未予同意。苏联政府已将朝鲜最高人民议会所提苏、美军队同时撤离朝鲜的问题报告苏联最高苏维埃主席团，主席团考虑了朝鲜最高人民议会上述呼吁，承认将苏军撤离北朝鲜是合时的，并表示希望美国政府也同意将美军撤离南朝鲜，象朝鲜最高人民议会所请求者一样。苏联部长会议遵奉苏联最高苏维埃主席团决定，兹作下列决议：（一）将驻留北朝鲜的苏军撤至苏联领土；（二）命令苏联武装部队部不迟于今年十月下半月开始将苏军撤离北朝鲜，至一九四九年一月一日完成此项工作。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】各方报导：美国务卿马歇尔十九日在华盛顿记者招待会上表示：美国“不拟自南朝鲜撤退美军”。这在朝鲜人民最高议会要求美苏同时自朝鲜撤军，及苏联宣布从北朝鲜撤军的今日，又一次使美帝国主义的奴役朝鲜人民的阴谋暴露于世界舆论谴责之前。前此，李承晚驻美代表陈约翰即奉承美国主子旨意，在纽约记者招待会上声称：即使苏军撤离朝鲜，李承晚政府也将请求美军驻留朝鲜。又塔斯社十七日所引的平壤电台广播称：李承晚走狗政府和南朝鲜美占领军司令部之间最近缔结了协定，规定南朝鲜警察和军队将全属美国人统辖，而美军则未确定撤离朝鲜日期，即无限期留驻南朝鲜。广播并指出：伪政府已于九月十日将煤矿和动力工业移交给美国人，南朝鲜的全部经济现已在美国的控制之下。这些都证明，旬日前南朝鲜美军政府将其所辖十一个部门移交给李承晚政府，是最虚伪不过了。
