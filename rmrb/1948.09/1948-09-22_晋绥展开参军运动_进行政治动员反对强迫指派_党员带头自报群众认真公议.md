Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 19th—The military recruitment campaign unfolding throughout the Jin-Sui area has now concluded successfully in counties such as Linxian, Lishi, Suixian, and Daixian. In some areas, the campaign has even exceeded the original plan by more than one-half. The reasons this recruitment campaign has received the enthusiastic support of the people, aside from the unprecedented heightening of the people's political awareness after the implementation of land reform and preliminary Party rectification, and the transformation of the style of work of cadres and Party members, are also due to the following three correct methods adopted by local leading organs in completing the recruitment work: First, boldly and openly conduct political mobilization, opposing assignment and coercion. At the beginning of mobilization in various localities, in-depth propaganda of "For whom are we joining the army?" was universally carried out. For example, in Guoxian County, the village peasant representative conference fully discussed "Whose army is the People's Liberation Army, and for whom are they fighting?", enabling the people to clearly understand "This is our own army," and "Fighting is for our own liberation," establishing the idea of the people's army and the people building the army, and breaking down the idea that some people regard joining the army as "the higher-ups want soldiers." Some people also did not have enough understanding of the people's awareness, believing that "other things can be democratic, but joining the army cannot be democratic," and "there is not a single volunteer." However, after implementing political mobilization and creating a mass upsurge in joining the army, these erroneous understandings were broken by the facts. Various localities also universally held celebrations for the victory on the Jinzhong front, encouraging the people's emotions of joining the army to avenge themselves. Second, call on Party members and cadres to take the lead in joining the army and implement mass democratic recommendation and evaluation. In the past, only the masses were mobilized to join the army, but cadres did not move, causing dissatisfaction among the masses; this time, the leadership of Party members and cadres was put first. Due to the Party rectification, Party members and cadres actively took the lead in joining the army this time, and the movement immediately unfolded. Liu Feng, the secretary of the Linxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and many county and district cadres joined the army; in the second district of the county, Communist Party members accounted for half of the young people joining the army. In order to make joining the army reasonable, various localities, while cadres took the lead and the masses volunteered, also carried out mutual recommendation and democratic evaluation by the masses. However, during the recommendation and evaluation, in-depth political mobilization must still be carried out for the recommended or decided persons to avoid creating another form of coercion. Some areas have experienced this error. Third, establish the idea of being responsible to the people's army to the end. Not only guarantee the completion of the number, but also guarantee the quality. New soldiers must be approved by mass evaluation, no landlords or rich peasants, no old or weak, so that the troops can become "elite soldiers." For example, in Longgong Village, Guoxian County, more than sixty people signed up, but only twenty-five were approved by the mass review. At the same time, it is also necessary to overcome the wrong idea of "once the new soldiers are sent away, everything is fine," and truly do a good job in supporting the army and breaking down the family concerns of the new soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th—In recent months, the people of various counties in Andong Province have universally launched an upsurge in joining the army. More than 2,300 young adults have enlisted in five counties, including Fengcheng, Andong, and Xinbin.

　　晋绥展开参军运动
    进行政治动员反对强迫指派
  　党员带头自报群众认真公议
    【新华社晋绥十九日电】在晋绥全境展开的参军运动，现已有临县、离石、绥县、代县等县胜利结束，有的地区并超过原订计划二分之一以上。这次参军运动所以得到人民的热烈拥护，除了因为实行土地改革和初步整党后，人民的政治觉悟空前提高，和干部与党员的作风得到改造外，还因为各地领导机关在完成参军工作中采取了下列三种正确的方法：第一、大胆公开地进行政治动员，反对了指派和强迫。各地动员之初普遍进行了“为谁参军”的深入宣传。如崞县在村农代会中充分讨论了“解放军是谁的队伍，为谁打仗”，使人民明确地认识了“这是咱自己的军队”，“打仗是为自己解放”，树立人民军队、人民建军的思想，打破了有些人把参军认作“上面要兵”的思想。也有些人对人民的觉悟认识不够，认为“别的事情能民主，参军不能民主”，“没有一个自愿的”。但经实行政治动员造成参军的群众热潮后，这些错误认识都被事实打破了。各地还普遍召开了庆祝晋中前线胜利大会，鼓舞了人民参军复仇的情绪。第二、号召党员干部带头参军和实行群众民主推荐与评议。过去参军，只动员群众，干部却不动，引起群众不满；这次将党员干部带头提到第一位。由于经过整党，这次党员、干部都积极带头参军，于是运动立即展开。临县中共县委刘枫和许多县、区干部都参了军；该县二区参军青年中，共产党员占一半。为求参军的合理，各地并在干部带头和群众自报同时，由群众互相推荐和民主评议。但推荐与评议时，对被推荐者或议定者，仍要进行深入政治动员，避免产生另一种形式的强迫命令。某些地区是曾发生了这种错误的。第三、确立为人民军队负责到底的思想。不仅保证数目完成，还要保证质量。新战士都须经过群众评议批准，不要地富分子，不要老弱，使部队尽成“精兵”。如崞县龙宫村报名者六十余人，经群众审查批准的只二十五人。同时还要克服“新战士一送走就万事大吉”的错误思想，要真正做好优军工作，打破新战士的家庭顾虑。
    【新华社东北十九日电】安东省各县人民近月来普遍掀起参军热潮，凤城、安东、新宾等五县已有二千三百余青壮年入伍。
