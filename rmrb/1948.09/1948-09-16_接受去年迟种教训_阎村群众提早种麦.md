【Taihang News】In Yan Village, Xiangyuan Third District, the wheat was planted late last year, and some of it didn't even turn yellow this summer. Coupled with the yellow dwarf and black rust diseases, most of the crops failed. On August 24th, the village held a meeting of cadres above the group leader level to discuss wheat planting. First, Branch Secretary Xu Haifang talked about the disadvantages of late planting affecting the harvest last year, and suggested that attention should be paid to seed selection this year to prevent yellow dwarf and black rust, and asked everyone to discuss it. Xu Liankui said, "If you ask me, the wheat should be planted now. As the ancients often said: 'If it dew in the seventh month, it's over; if it dews in the eighth month, it's not over.' Isn't it the eighth month now? It should be planted now!" Xu Qingchang said, "Last year I planted a piece of wheat in Ya'ergou. When others were planting, we thought it was too early and waited for two days. Then it rained, and planting was delayed. When we harvested this summer, other people's early wheat was good, but our wheat had both yellow dwarf and black rust, and it only yielded a斗把多 per mu. This year, I prepared the land early and sent the manure to the field. I plan to plant it in half a day." Zhao Waniu said, "Xu Zhongqi planted four mu of wheat early, and it grew very well. Early planting yields a harvest every year, while late planting depends on luck. In the past two years, whether it's autumn or summer, planting early is better." After discussion, everyone agreed to plant early, but also pointed out that early planting should not mean that manure is not applied to the fields. Finally, the branch secretary proposed: we must publicize to the masses to plant earlier, but don't delay planting. If the task of requisitioning stretchers comes, we will panic and not be able to plant wheat well. Each mutual aid group should plan adjustments and see which piece of land is prepared and has manure, and plant it first; if there is no manure, hurry up and haul it and prepare the land. After this meeting, the whole village started working, some hauling manure, some preparing the land, and those who were ready planted. According to statistics on August 30th, 182 mu had been planted.

　　接受去年迟种教训
  　阎村群众提早种麦
    【太行讯】襄垣三区阎村去年麦种的迟了，今夏有的根本就没黄，再加上黄黑疸病害，大部分歉收。八月二十四日，该村召开了组长以上的干部会议，讨论种麦问题。首先有支书许海芳谈了去年种迟影响丰收的害处，并提出了今年要注意选种，防止黄黑疸，让大家酝酿讨论，许连魁说：“要叫我说，麦是种的啦，古人常说：七月露，过了露，八月露，不过露。今年不是八月露吗？现在就种的啦！”许青昌说：“我去年在鸦儿沟种了块麦，人家都种时咱嫌早，等了两天，又下来雨，下种迟啦。今年收夏时，人家早麦都好，咱那麦又黄疸，又黑疸，一亩打了斗把多，今年我早早把地修好了，粪也送到地啦，一半天就打算种哩。”赵娃牛说：“许中起早种了四亩麦，长的很好，早种年年收迟种碰年头；这两年不管秋夏都是种早了好。”经过讨论，大家都同意早种，但又提出不要因早种就上不到地里粪。最后支书提出：要向群众宣传，早些种，可不要叫耽误了下种，再等出担架任务来，咱们就慌了手脚，种不好麦了。各互助组，计划调剂，看哪块地修好，有了粪，就先种；没粪，赶快拉赶快修地。经过这次会后，全村都干起来，有的拉粪，有的修地，好了的就种。八月卅号统计，已下种了一百八十二亩。　　　　　　（襄垣联合办公室）
