　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 12th. The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to strengthen education on class, party spirit, internationalism, the spirit of self-criticism, and discipline within the Party during the cadre study movement, issued a notice on July 21st, instructing Party committees at all levels to list the Information Bureau of the Nine Communist Parties' "Resolution on the Situation of the Yugoslav Communist Party," the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Resolution on the Yugoslav Communist Party Issue," and the document "Opposing Empiricism" as study materials for senior Party cadres in the recent period. On August 21st, a further directive was issued, instructing all localities to link the study of the above three documents with the previously studied Central Propaganda Department's "Reprint of the Preface to Chapter Two of 'Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder'" and the recent "Questions and Answers on Agricultural Socialism." It also succinctly highlighted four issues to be clarified in the study of these documents, namely: "Opposing bourgeois nationalism, upholding proletarian internationalism," "Class and class struggle," "Developing criticism and self-criticism within the Party," and "Strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism and opposing empiricism." The directive instructed Party committees at all levels to conduct a review in the near future to further deepen the study movement. Currently, directly affiliated organs of the Northeast Bureau are studying according to the above-mentioned central issues.
　　
　　Furthermore, the Propaganda Department of the Songjiang Provincial Party Committee, based on the situation of the cadres, divides the study into three categories: A, B, and C. Category A includes upper-level cadres with considerable work experience, theoretical level, and reading ability, who study according to the directives of the Northeast Bureau. Category B includes middle and lower-level cadres with considerable self-study ability but less theoretical knowledge and work experience, who should combine with Party building work and study Party constitution materials,党员读本 (Party Member Reader), production policies, class division, land reform summaries, opposing liberalism, working methods, and the mass line. The county Party committee should allocate time to give them reports on the South Communist issue. Category C includes worker and peasant cadres who are illiterate or have limited literacy, who, in addition to strengthening the study of culture and current work business, are assisted by specialists in studying policies.

　　东北局指示加强学习
    注重党内关于阶级的、党的、国际主义的、自我批评和纪律性的教育。
    【新华社东北十二日电】中共中央东北局为加强干部学习运动中，党内关于阶级的、党的、国际主义的、自我批评精神和纪律性的教育，曾于七月二十一日发出通知，责成各级党委将九国共产党情报局“关于南斯拉夫共产党状况的决议”、中共中央“关于南斯拉夫共产党问题的决议”及“反对经验主义”三个文件列为最近时期党内高级干部的学习材料。八月二十一日复发出指示，要各地将以上三个文件的学习和过去已学习过的中宣部“重印左派幼稚病第二章前言”及最近“关于农业社会主义的问答”两文件联系起来。并扼要的提示了在这些文件学习中要弄清的四个问题，即：“反对资产阶级的民族主义，坚持无产阶级的国际主义”、“阶级与阶级斗争”、“开展党内批评与自我批评”、“加强马列主义理论学习，反对经验主义”。指示责成各级党委必须在最近期内检查一次，使学习运动深入一步。现东北局直属各机关正根据以上中心按问题依次学习中。
    又讯：松江省委宣传部根据干部情况，分甲、乙、丙三类学习。甲类为有相当工作经验、理论水平与阅读能力之上级干部，按照东北局指示学习。乙类为有相当自学能力而理论知识工作经验均较少的中下级干部，应与建党工作相结合，学习党章教材、党员读本、生产政策、划分阶级、土改总结、反对自由主义、工作方法与群众路线等，由县委抽时间给他们作南共问题的报告。丙类为没有文化或粗通文字的工农干部，除加强文化与当前工作业务的学习外，并由专人帮助他们学习政策。
