[Taihang Telegram] After Lucheng, Shexian, Xiyang, and other counties corrected their policies and clarified their educational guidelines, cadres at all levels and the masses have begun to attach importance to and care about education. Teachers' morale has greatly improved, and there have also been new improvements in teaching methods. After studying the new education guidelines, a teacher at Shenquan Elementary School in Lucheng went to various households to explain that the main focus in the future would be on literacy, mobilizing 35 children in the village to enroll in school. In Zhushipu, Xiyang, there were a total of 117 school-age children, but only 21 attended school. The elementary school teacher in the village, on the one hand, used children to mobilize each other to enroll, and on the other hand, focused on the learning of existing children, using actual achievements to break through the thinking of children's parents. As a result, the number of students increased from 21 to 62. In order to change the past negative impression of the school among the masses and consolidate the children's enthusiasm, the teacher of Baicun in the first district compiled the academic achievements of each student in each semester into a rhythmic story and asked the children to go back and present their achievements to their parents. For example, after student Hou Yongen completed one book, the teacher compiled a rhythmic story based on his academic performance: "Little model Hou Yongen, diligent in learning, writes well, writes truly, memorizes and writes two books thoroughly, and can also memorize and write the names of 27 villages." After the child went home and read it to his father, his father was very happy and bought Hou Yongen many slate pencils and hemp paper to encourage him to continue to study hard, and told others everywhere on the street: "The school is different from before. Hou Yongen recognized so many characters in a few days and wrote through two thick books." In terms of teaching methods, the teacher at Zhushipu Elementary School was very patient when teaching children to recognize characters. Before each lesson, he wrote the new words on the blackboard, stroke by stroke, to teach students how to write and recognize them. Then, he opened the textbook and asked the children to read and explain it themselves. If there was anything they couldn't understand, everyone discussed it, and the teacher made a final supplement. When Qian Kuanzhang Elementary School in Shexian was on vacation to pick peppercorns, in order not to delay the students' studies, they made literacy cards for each student, copying the new words according to grade and textbook. In the morning, the children were asked to lead the cards to recognize the characters, and in the evening, they reported their results to the school. Due to the changes in educational guidelines and teaching methods, the number of enrolled children has generally increased, and the masses are very concerned about the school and the learning of their children. When the masses in Wujing Village, the first district of Hebei and Ping Shun, saw that the elementary school in their village had no desks or benches, they suggested to the teacher to ask the village education committee to find a way to repair them. Shu Richang, a villager in the village, saw that the school walls in his village were collapsing and the roof was leaking, so he automatically drove his two donkeys to carry bricks and soil for construction. Zhao Village Elementary School in the fifth district of Changzhi has overcome the past chaotic phenomena, and the masses reflected: "There are not many schools like today. In the past, they didn't let their children study well, and they couldn't even recognize their own names in a year." Wang Guishan, a villager, saw that his son recognized many characters during this period, so he specially bought a slate and writing brush for his child when he went to Yincheng market and repeatedly told him to study hard.

　　潞城等县纠正偏向后
  　小学教育大有转机
    【太行电】潞城、涉县、昔阳等县经过端正政策明确教育方针后，各级干部与群众对教育工作已开始重视和关心。教员情绪大大提高，在教学方法上亦有新的改进。潞城神泉小学教员学习回去后，经过深入各户解释新教育方针，说明今后主要以识字为主，动员了全村三十五个儿童入学。昔阳朱石铺学龄儿童共一百一十七人，但到校的仅二十一个，该村小学教员一方面运用儿童互相动员入学，同时抓紧现有儿童学习，用实际成绩打通儿童家长思想，结果由廿一个学生增至六十二个。一区白村教员为了转变过去群众对学校的不良印象和巩固儿童情绪，便把每个学生每学期的学业成绩编成快板，叫儿童回去给家长献成绩。如学生侯永恩学完一册后，教员便根据他的学习成绩编成快板：“小模范侯永恩，对学习肯用功，写的好，写的真，两本一册背写通，还能背写二十七个村名。”该儿童回家给他爸念后，他爸听了非常喜欢，给侯永恩买了许多石笔麻纸鼓励其继续好好用功，并在街上到处告别人说：“现在的学校可和以前不一样了，侯永恩不几天认了那么多的字，把厚厚的两本书都写通啦。”在教学方法上朱石铺小学教员教儿童认字时非常耐心，在每一课前先把课内生字写在黑板上，一笔一画叫学生写会认会，然后再翻开课本叫儿童自己念自己讲，有闹不通的地方大家讨论，教员最后作补充。涉县前宽漳小学在放假摘花椒时，为了不耽误学生学习，便给每一学生制了识字牌，按年级按课本把生字抄上，早上叫儿童领牌认字，黄昏时到校汇报成绩。由于教育方针及教学方式的转变，入学儿童都普遍增加，群众对学校和自己子弟的学习也非常关心。和平顺一区五井村群众看到本村小学没桌子没凳子便给教员建议要求村教育委员会设法修补，该村群众舒日昌看到本村小学校墙倒屋漏，便自动赶上自己的两头毛驴驮砖土修筑。长治五区赵村小学由于克服了过去混乱现象，群众反映说：“象今天这样的学校还是不多，过去不让孩子好好念书，一年连自己的名字都认不得”。该村王贵山看到自己儿子这一时期认字很多，到荫城赶集时特给自己小孩买下石板毛笔并再三嘱其努力学习。
