　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 27th. TASS, New York, September 23rd: The National Committee of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) issued a statement to the press, denouncing the leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties as responsible for the assassination attempt on Thompson, a member of the CPUSA National Committee. The statement said, "This fascist attack must be directly blamed on the bipartisan conspirators of the Democratic and Republican parties, who are inciting violent 'anti-red terror' to pave the way for fascism and war." The statement emphasized that this attack was political in nature and a direct result of this "anti-red terror." "Anti-red terror" creates a political atmosphere that encourages fascists to use violence against communists and all Americans who oppose Wall Street's plans. Communist Party General Secretary Dennis announced that he had sent a letter to Attorney General Clark, demanding that the federal government arrest the perpetrators.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 25th. TASS, New York, September 22nd: The "Civil Rights Congress" announced that a petition signed by 1,100 members of the CIO and AFL had been sent to the White House, protesting the government's persecution of twelve CPUSA leaders and demanding an end to the suppression of the democratic rights of the Communist Party. This petition marks the beginning of a campaign to collect 250,000 union member signatures in protest and indicates that unions are weary of the intimidation of various "red scare" tactics aimed at covering up the destruction of union activities and the people's living standards.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 25th. New York News: Gates, the editor-in-chief of the New York Worker's Daily, announced to reporters that on the morning of September 22nd, three unidentified individuals attacked Thompson, the chairman of the Communist Party of New York State. Thompson sustained injuries to his head and abdomen.

　　美共全委会发表声明
  　民主共和两党应对汤姆逊遇刺负责
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：美共全国委员会对报界发表声明，斥责民主共和两党领袖应对谋刺美共全国委会委员汤姆逊负责。声明称，“这次法西斯攻击必须由民主共和两党的两党一致的阴谋家直接负责，他们煽动狂暴的‘反赤恐怖’，借以为法西斯主义和战争开辟道路。”声明强调指出：这次攻击是属于政治性质的攻击，乃是这种“反赤恐怖”的直接结果。“反赤恐怖”造成一种鼓励法西斯分子用暴力对付共产党人及一切反对华尔街计划的美国人的政治气氛。共产党总书记但尼斯宣布，他已致函司法部长克拉克，要求联邦当逮捕凶手。

    【新华社陕北二十五日电】纽约讯：纽约工人日报总编辑盖兹向记者宣布：九月二十二日清晨，三个来历不明的人行刺共产党纽约州主席汤姆逊。汤氏头部及腹部受伤。
