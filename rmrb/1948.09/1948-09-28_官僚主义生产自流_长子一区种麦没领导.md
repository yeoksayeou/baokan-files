　　Bureaucracy Leads to Uncontrolled Production
　　No Leadership in Wheat Planting in the First District of Changzi
　　[Taiyue Electric] According to the production inspection team of the Yuebei Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office: Bureaucracy exists in the leadership of production in the Changzi area, affecting the wheat planting work. On the 28th of last month, when the district held a meeting of all district cadres to report on production work, it was very perfunctory, and no problems were raised or resolved before preparing to end it. The inspection team suggested a thorough inspection. When asked how much the prefecture had allocated to the county for wheat seeds out of the 400 shi of wheat seeds and 27 million yuan of fertilizer loans, none of the twelve district cadres present knew. However, according to Director Yang of the county office, the wheat planting loans were distributed to the districts on August 9th, but it had been 20 days since then. Although the loans were distributed later, they were very untimely. Lingshang Village received a fertilizer loan of 92,000 yuan, but it was only issued to the village on the 5th of this month. Some villagers had already planted wheat, so a portion of the loan could not be used, which affected the enthusiasm of the masses to apply manure. Secondly, the production leadership organization in the entire district is also very unsound. The Northwest Sub-district, with sixteen administrative villages, has not established production committees. Each village only has one production committee member who only does some work such as allocating preferential treatment to military families, and rarely inquires about the overall production of the village. The district has also failed to supervise and inspect this. The reason for these phenomena, according to this discussion, is mainly that the leadership has a bureaucratic work style, does not understand the situation in the villages, and does not have a complete set of sound systems. For example, instructions from higher levels to lower levels are often kept by whoever receives them in their pockets or backpacks, and there is no explanation when they go out. The ideological root cause is that some comrades have the mistaken idea that "the masses will produce even without leadership," and the leadership has failed to educate and correct this in a timely manner, resulting in uncontrolled production. Only after this meeting did it attract everyone's attention.

### 官僚主义生产自流　长子一区种麦没领导

　　官僚主义生产自流
  　长子一区种麦没领导
    【太岳电】据岳北地委与专署生产检查小组报告：长子一带，对生产的领导存在着官僚主义，影响了种麦工作。上月二十八日，该区召开全区干部会议汇报生产工作时很潦草，也没提出和解决什么问题，就准备结束。检查组提议深入检查一下，问到专署给全县贷麦种四百石，肥料贷款二千七百万元，该区分配了多少，怎样分配的，到会的十二个区干部竟没有一个人知道。但据县里办公室杨主任谈，八月九日种麦贷款即已分配到区，当时已过了二十天。以后贷款虽分发了，但已很不及时。岭上村贷了九万二千元肥料贷款，本月五日才发到村，有的群众麦已经种上了，所以有一部分就贷不出去，影响了群众上粪。其次，全区生产领导组织上也很不健全，西北小区十六个行政村都没建立起生产委员会，每村只有一个生产委员，只作了一些拨差优军等工作，对全村生产很少过问，区上对此也没有督促检查。产生这些现象的原因，据这次讨论，主要是领导上存在着官僚主义作风，不了解村中情况，也没有整套健全制度，如上级对下的指示，往往是谁收到谁装到口袋里或放到背包里，出外走了也没有个交代。其思想根源是一部分同志存在着“不用领导群众也会生产”的错误想法，领导上也未能及时教育纠正，以致生产形成自流。经过这次会议，才引起大家的注意。
