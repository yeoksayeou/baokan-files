　　【Taihang News】 Since the expanded cadre meeting in She County on the 24th of last month, village cadres have returned and conducted policy propaganda and education, which has boosted the production enthusiasm of the masses. According to reports received by the office from the first, second, fifth, seventh, and eighth districts, most villages have launched a manure accumulation and production increase campaign in the past ten days, and have formulated specific plans for expanding wheat field preparation for intercropping wheat, and are starting to reorganize cooperatives. The process has proven that breaking down ideological barriers is the key to promoting wheat planting and manure accumulation. For example, in Xiaoche Village in the fifth district, when the production committee mobilized the masses to accumulate manure, poor peasant Li Jinyuan said: "Accumulate manure! The fruits of the distribution might have to be returned to others, let's wait and see!" The leadership then carried out propaganda to end land reform and production policies. Middle peasant Li Shigong also clarified that earning a living through labor will not change, and there will be no absolute equal distribution, and said he was still planning to buy another mu of good land. After policy propaganda, the whole village cut artemisia and accumulated 7,500 loads of manure in three days. In Dongyu Village in the eighth district, after policy propaganda, the whole village first collected 13,000 jin of firewood for the families of soldiers, striving to expand wheat fields to more than 50%. Shentou and Linghou accumulated 40,000 dan of manure in five days after policy propaganda. The seventh district convened a district-wide village cadre meeting to explain policies, and everyone was in high spirits, and they formulated manure accumulation and wheat planting plans. The district also formulated a district-wide plan based on the specific wheat planting plans of each village. Dry land wheat planting in the district accounts for about 66% of the total dry land area, and paddy field wheat planting accounts for 80% of the paddy field area. We also strive to plant wheat in the garden land. We strive to apply 25 to 30 dan of fertilizer to dry and paddy fields. Conversely, in places where policy propaganda is not good or has not been carried out, the masses' thinking is confused, and production enthusiasm is not high. For example, in the Xishu base point in the third district, the masses are not thorough about the policies. When the leadership proposed expanding wheat fields and accumulating manure, the masses were not very enthusiastic, and only said that there were many late crops and intercropping wheat was not possible.

　　When Linghou discussed the lack of fertilizer for intercropping wheat, the old man Sun Shixiang said: "Last year, I intercropped wheat by rubbing the wheat seeds with oil. One jin of oil is enough for one dou of wheat seeds. Intercropping provides top and base fertilizer." When Nan Village in the first district was brewing and discussing intercropping wheat, some people proposed that it should still be called intercropping wheat, but we suffered losses from intercropping last year, and it is better to have one crop a year. Wang Jinshui said: "The wheat of Wang Shouhun in our village matured early last year, and this year's wheat yielded five dou per mu, mainly because you intercropped it late." Everyone agreed with this opinion, and after discussion, the whole village will plant 75% of the dry land.

　　宣传政策打破思想障碍
  　涉县开展积肥串麦
    【太行讯】涉县在上月二十四日扩大干部会议后，各村干部回去都作了政策的宣传教育，群众的生产情绪提高。据办公室接到一、二、五、七、八区的汇报来看，十日来绝大部分村是开展了积肥增产运动，及扩大麦田准备串种麦的具体计划，并着手整理合作社。在进行中证明打破思想障碍，是推动种麦积肥的关键。如五区小车在生产委员会动员群众积肥时，贫农李金元说：“积肥哩！分的果实地不定还给人家退回哩，等等再说吧！”领导上就进行宣传结束土改和生产政策。中农李世功也明确了劳动起家不动，不是绝对平分，他说我还准备再买一亩好地。经宣传政策后，全村三天割蒿积肥七千五百驮。八区东宇庄在宣传政策后，首先全村给抗属打柴一万三千斤，争取扩大麦田到百分之五十以上。神头、岭后，经过宣传政策，五天积肥四万担。七区召开全区村干部会，讲解政策，大家情绪很高，纷纷订出积肥种麦计划。区上根据各村的具体种麦计划，也订出了全区的计划。全区旱地种麦约占旱地总数百分之六十六，水地种麦占水地百分之八十。园子地也争取种上麦子。旱地水地争取上二十五担到卅担肥。反之在宣传政策不好或未进行宣传的地方，群众思想混乱，生产情绪是不高。如三区西戍基点，群众对政策不蹬底，当领导上提出扩大麦田积肥时，群众劲头不大，只说晚庄稼多，串麦不行等。
    岭后在讨论串种麦缺肥时，老汉孙时香说：我去年串种麦就是用油搓了麦种，一斗麦种用一斤油就行，串种上顶上底肥。一区南庄村在酝酿讨论串麦时，有的人提出还叫串种麦哩，咱去年串就吃了亏，还不如一年一季哩。王金水说：“咱村王寿勋去年麦子的早，今年的麦子每亩打了五斗，主要是你串的迟了。”大家都同意这意见，经讨论，全村旱地要种到百分之七十五。
