　　Achievements and Problems in the Cadre Study in Taihang Over the Past Two Months
　　The cadre study in Taihang started on July 10th and has lasted for nearly two months. Below is the general situation of these two months:
　　Achievements in Learning
　　1. Learning has been absorbed: Comrades who previously lacked confidence, interest, had complaints, or had problems in learning have undergone significant changes after their personal issues were appropriately resolved during the study, and their learning attitudes have been corrected. Some cadres from the First Prefectural Committee said, "This is the first time since joining the revolution that I have really absorbed the learning." They also said, "I am finally feeling interested, and listening to a lecture once is better than reading it myself ten times." A cadre from Changzhi said, "In the past, I felt that my brain was not sufficient, but in reality, I was afraid of using my brain; saying that my memory was not strong was actually because I was not concentrating; I was constantly daydreaming. Saying I had no time was actually because I lacked determination. Without studying, work is equivalent to doing it blindly. Only now do I realize the disadvantage of not studying."
　　2. Preliminary examination and reflection were conducted by the organs and individuals: After studying the document "Lenin on How Soviet Staff Should Work," the District Party Committee and Military Region Political Department deeply felt that in the past, their work lacked planning, system, unclear division of responsibilities, poor research on issues, failure to understand the situation below, delay and carelessness, and failure to provide specific guidance to the lower levels in a timely manner. There was only deployment of work without inspection. There was a lack of serious and responsible spirit towards the people's cause, and a lack of long-term construction perspective in every matter (even small issues).
　　In terms of personal reflection, there are generally the following kinds of thoughts: (1) After the reorganization, there was fear of making mistakes, and they dared not work boldly, thinking that it was better to do less than to do more, and whoever was active would be unlucky. Some comrades secretly made plans for themselves: to protect themselves wisely, seek no merit but avoid fault, and do whatever they were asked to do, but ignore everything else. Some comrades, when working at the lower levels, insisted on having the tasks assigned by the leaders in written form, fearing that if something went wrong in the future, no one would be responsible. (2) They also showed enthusiasm in their work, but did not like to study, did not want to use their brains, did whatever came their way, and grabbed at whatever they thought of, making a mess, but not getting anywhere. They thought that the instructions and policies from above were always the same old thing, and put them aside after looking at them. Studying or not studying could not solve the difficulties of "counting ballots," "buying vegetables," "calculating accounts," and "cutting stencils." They were sweating profusely when busy, and sleeping soundly when idle. (3) They were not at ease or responsible in their work, shied away from trouble, and made excuses; their hearts were not in the office, and they thought only about personal matters all day long, unable to accomplish anything even sitting at their desks for half a day.
　　3. The enthusiasm of cadres has been enhanced through examination and reflection, and the work of the organs has been initially transformed: After the examination, the District Party Committee and the Political Department stipulated some new systems and improvement methods in order to correct the problems, and most of them have been implemented consistently. The Audit Section of the Fourth Prefectural Committee Secretariat took the initiative to convene a meeting of the secretaries of the county committees to understand and study the living and production conditions of the organs in each county. The Finance and Grain Section of the Fourth Special Commissioner's Office used to take three days to produce a monthly report, but now it only takes half a day. The accountants used to calculate the abacus seven or eight times without being sure, but now they only need to do it three times. The transportation personnel of the District Party Committee organs used to take at least fifteen days to go to the Fourth Military Sub-district, but now it only takes ten days for a round trip. It has also been shortened by two days to go to the Second Military Sub-district.
　　Continued Efforts Are Needed
　　The achievements mentioned above only indicate that the transformation has just begun, because in fact, the phenomenon of lack of organization, discipline, delay, and carelessness still exists universally in the entire area, and continued efforts are needed to overcome it. In the scope of propaganda work alone, many inappropriate events have already occurred: For example, the Sixth Branch of the Jinnan Bank published a newspaper without the approval of the Prefectural Committee, and published a founding speech in the name of an individual. The Huixian United Office printed and distributed a summary of the propaganda of the production movement with errors in its content without the examination of the Prefectural Committee. Qi County casually published a "Special Issue on Captives," which completely misunderstood our Party's lenient policy and fully reflected the right-leaning sentiment of the county's leadership in winning over and disintegrating the enemy's puppet troops. Although these facts have been criticized and corrected by the District Party Committee and the Prefectural Committee, it can be seen that truly learning the documents and transforming work is still an arduous process of effort.
　　How is the Learning Being Led?
　　(1) Strengthening ideological leadership in learning, stipulating clear objectives and requirements for each document in advance, conducting necessary lectures and answering questions, making discussion summaries, promptly exchanging learning experiences, and consciously and plannedly praising, rewarding, and criticizing - this is what "leaders taking responsibility and personally doing it" means.
　　(2) In terms of reading methods, the document is first read collectively once, then read section by section to clarify the general meaning of the words and phrases. Then, discussions are conducted in connection with personal familiar matters. After the discussion, they return to understanding the spirit and essence of the document, and then enter a more systematic examination and reflection, and finally rise to the principles to conduct a comprehensive study. Whoever has the deepest understanding of a certain point during the discussion will be the main speaker. For comrades with self-study conditions, self-study is the main focus, in order to cultivate their ability and habit of thinking independently.
　　(3) The Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee and the local committees have seriously conducted multiple inspections, and have begun to overcome the problem of "everything is fine once the task is assigned." Two direct-affiliated organ learning review meetings have been held before and after, and the reports from various places have been answered promptly by means of convenience letters. The propaganda departments of the local committees have also held more than two inspection meetings, almost every time presided over by the local committee or the head of the propaganda department.
　　(4) Starting in August, the learning situation, experience, problems, as well as personal learning experiences and typical reflections from various places have been published in the Taihang Xinhua Daily one after another, to strengthen the learning guidance to the entire area through the Party newspaper. This work is not yet systematic and regularized enough, and the newspaper has not yet truly played its role in guiding and promoting learning.
　　Problems in Learning
　　In the beginning, some units only emphasized organizational guarantees and neglected ideological leadership, mechanically implementing the two-hour collective learning system. The higher authorities neither raised questions nor solved problems, resulting in opposition between the lower authorities and the branches, and everyone's learning enthusiasm was not high, such as the Public Security Bureau of the Fourth Military Sub-district and the Military Committee of the Fifth Military Sub-district. Some units made egalitarian mistakes in leadership, without considering the degree, differentiating the situation, or combining the cadres' business requirements, and uniformly distributed the four major documents, making it difficult for some cadres to digest and not enthusiastic. In some places, the leaders did not clearly stipulate the purpose and requirements of the documents in advance, so everyone argued and reflected for a long time, but in the end, they did not grasp the essence of the documents and took detours. In some units, many things were reflected, and a pile of materials was gathered, but the leaders did not analyze and criticize them, and did not summarize them in time, which greatly affected the effectiveness.

### 太行两月来干部学习的成绩与问题

　　太行两月来干部学习的成绩与问题
    太行干部学习，从七月十日开始，将近两月，下面是这两个月来的一般情况：
  　学习有成绩
    一、学进去了：过去在学习上没信心、没兴趣、有牢骚、有问题的同志，经过在学习中个人问题的适当解决，端正了学习态度，有了很大转变。一地委一些干部说：“参加革命以来，第一次学习进去了。”又说：“这才感到兴趣、听讲一遍，比自己读十遍都强。”长治一个干部说：“过去我觉得脑筋不够用，实际上是怕用脑子；说自己记忆力不强，实际上是思想不集中；成天胡思乱想。说没时间，实际上是没决心。不学习，工作就等于瞎干，这才知道吃了不学习的亏。”
    二、机关和个人进行了初步检查反省：区党委和军区政治部，在学习“列宁论苏维埃机关人员应如何工作”文件后，深感过去在工作中无计划、无制度，分工职责不明，研究问题差，不了解下情，拖延草率，不能及时给下面以具体指导。工作有布置没有检查。在每一件事情上（那怕是细小问题）缺乏严肃的、对人民事业负责的精神，缺乏长期建设观点。
    个人反省方面，一般有这样几种思想：（一）整编以后怕犯错误，工作不敢大胆干，认为多一事不如少一事，谁积极谁倒霉。有的同志暗中给自己订出计划：明哲保身，但求无过，叫我干啥就干啥，其他一概不管。还有的同志在下边做工作，领导上布置任务时，非写成成文不可，怕将来出岔子没人负责。（二）工作也表现积极，就是不爱学习，不想多用脑子，来了啥干啥，想起啥干啥，乱抓一阵，但忙不出个头绪来。对上级指示、政策认为总是那一套，看看便放到一边。学习不学习解决不了“点票子”，“买菜”，“算帐打算盘”，“刻蜡板”的困难。忙时满头大汗，闲时睡大觉。（三）工作不安心不负责、嫌麻烦，遇事推脱；身在机关心在外，一天想着的只是个人问题，坐在办公桌子旁半天也干不出一点事来。
    三、经过检讨反省提高了干部积极性，初步改造了机关工作：区党委和政治部经检查后，为了纠正毛病，规定了一些新制度和改进办法，大部已坚持实行了。四地委秘书处审计科主动召集各县委秘书开会，了解和研究各县机关生活和生产情况。四专署财粮科以前三天造一个月报表，现在只用半天，会计打算盘七八遍还不能保险，现在三遍就行了。区党委机关交通人员以前去四分区至少要十五天，现在只用十天即可往还，去二分区也缩短了两天。
  　还须继续努力
    有了上面提出的成绩，只说明转变才开始，因为事实上无组织、无纪律、拖延、草率现象在全区仍普遍的存在，仍须继续努力克服。仅就宣传工作范围来说，目前即已发生许多不应有的事件：如冀南银行六分行，不经地委批准就出版报纸，并以个人名义发表创刊词。辉县联合办公室不经地委审查就印发了一个内容有着错误的生产运动宣传要点。淇县随便出了一期“俘虏特刊”，完全误解我党的宽大政策，充分反映了该县领导上在争取瓦解敌伪军方面的右倾情绪，这些事实，虽都经区党委和地委批评纠正了。可以看到，真正学好文件改造工作，还是一个艰苦努力过程。
  　学习是怎样领导的
    （一）加强学习中的思想领导，对每个文件事先规定明确的目的和要求，进行必要的讲授和解答疑问，做讨论总结，即时交流学习经验，有意识有计划的表扬、奖励和批评，这才是“首长负责亲自动手”。
    （二）在阅读方法上，先集体把文件读一遍，然后逐段读，弄清辞句大意。再联系个人的熟知事情进行讨论，讨论后返回来领会文件的精神与实质，而后进入较系统的检查反省，最后提高到原则上来做全盘研究。讨论中谁对某一点体会最深刻谁即做主要发言人。对于有自修条件的同志以自学为主，以培养他们独自思考问题的能力和习惯。
    （三）区党委和各地委宣传部，认真进行了多次的检查，开始克服那种“任务布置下去就万事大吉”的毛病。前后开过两次直属机关学习检讨会，对各地报告及时的用便信方式答复。各地委宣传部也都开过两次以上的检查会议，差不多每次都由地委或地委宣传部长亲自主持。
    （四）从八月份开始，陆续把各地学习情况、经验、问题以及个人学习心得、典型反省等在太行新华日报发表，通过党报加强对全区学习指导，这个工作还不够系统化、经常化，还没使报纸真正发挥它指导和推动学习的作用。
  　学习中的毛病
    开始有些单位只强调组织保证，忽视了思想领导，机械的执行两小时集体学习制，上边既不提出问题，也不解决问题，结果形成下边和支部闹对立，大家学习情绪不高。如四分区公安局，五分区武委会。有些单位在领导上犯了平均主义，不按程度，不分情况，不结合干部的业务要求，千篇一律把四大文件布置下去，有些干部啃不动，劲头不大。有的地方领导上对文件目的和要求事先没明确规定，以致大家争论半天，反省半天，结果没掌握文件精神实质，走了弯路。还有的单位反省出许多东西，拢一堆材料，领导上未加分析批判，未及时讨论总结，影响收效很大。
