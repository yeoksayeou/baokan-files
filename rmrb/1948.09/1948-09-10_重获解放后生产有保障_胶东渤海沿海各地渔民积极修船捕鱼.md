Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th: The fishing industry in the coastal areas of Shandong is gradually recovering and flourishing. When the enemy launched a "major offensive" against Shandong last year, some fishing areas suffered disasters due to enemy occupation and harassment. According to statistics from 21 fishing villages in the suburbs of Weihaiwei City alone, when the enemy fled Weihai, 1,600 out of a total of more than 2,000 fishermen were captured; nearly 300 out of a total of about 400 fishing boats were robbed or destroyed. In Longkou, Changshan Island, Penglai, and Fushan in the Jiaodong-affiliated Bohai coastal area, 858 fishermen were captured by the enemy, 167 were killed or injured, and 65 fishing boats were looted and destroyed. In Shijiusuo, Rizhao County, Binhai, 350 fishermen were extorted more than 21.5 million yuan in Beihai currency. The loss of other grains, clothing, and fishing gear is incalculable. The vitality of the fishing villages was almost completely damaged, and the fishermen's lives were plunged into misery. After liberation, the democratic government provided assistance to fishermen in various aspects. According to incomplete statistics, the Shidao Production Promotion Society in Jiaodong District, the Bohai coastal fishing areas affiliated to Jiaodong, Huanghua County (formerly Xinhua County, Hebei) in the Bohai District, Cangma County (newly established county, east of Nuocheng) in the Binbei Sub-district of Jiaodong District, and Shijiusuo in Rizhao County, Binhai District, have successively issued fishing loans of 171.69 million yuan in Beihai currency, 1.78 million catties of grain, and a large number of tung oil and hemp thread and other raw materials for repairing boats in the past six months. In addition, agricultural loans and salt amounting to 100.7 million yuan, and nearly 500,000 catties of relief grain were distributed. The fishermen's confidence in production has been greatly enhanced. They actively repaired their boats and nets to go fishing and have reaped great profits. The total value of fish production income in twelve seaports such as Liujiawan Village, Penglai, Jiaodong, this spring and summer was more than 923 million yuan. According to statistics from Fengjiabao Village in Huanghua alone, the income from fish in half a year was more than 1.069 billion yuan. The lives of the villagers have been greatly improved, and every family has two to three years of surplus grain. Although it is nearly mid-May, the fishery in Shidao Port is still very impressive, and 100,000 catties of horseshoe crab can be produced daily at the Lidao seaport. In the first half of the year, the Shidao fishing area produced a total of 11.3 million catties of fish. However, this is still a decrease of 15 million catties compared to last year. The main reason for the decrease in production is that enemy warships and planes constantly bombarded and strafed our ports, causing fishermen to dare not go far to fish. Enemy speedboats also rushed and dispersed schools of fish in the fishing area, and killed fishermen, causing losses of 120 million yuan to coastal fishermen and merchants. After the fishermen produce, the government also provides strong support for sales and exports. After the Shidao Sea Market ended, the 150,000 catties of shrimp caught by the fishermen were exchanged by the Promotion Society for fertilizer for the farmers at the cost of 50 catties of autumn grain per 100 catties, which satisfied both parties. In addition, the government has also helped develop sideline production related to the fishing industry, such as blacksmithing, spinning, and net-making. Preparatory committees for fishermen's associations have been established in some areas to lead fishermen's work and strengthen the struggle against the enemy at sea to protect fishermen's production. Autumn fishery production will be even more guaranteed.

　　重获解放后生产有保障
  　胶东渤海沿海各地渔民积极修船捕鱼
    【新华社华东四日电】山东沿海各地渔业日趋恢复兴盛。去年敌人向山东进行“重点进攻”时，部分渔区，因遭敌侵陷及滋扰，渔民饱受灾难。仅威海卫市郊二十一个渔村统计，当敌人自威市逃窜时，全部二千余渔民即被抓走一千六百余人；全部约四百只渔船即被劫、毁近三百只。胶东所属渤海沿海龙口、长山岛、蓬莱、福山四地，被敌抓去渔民八百五十八人，打死打伤一百六十七名，劫去和破坏渔船六十五只；滨海日照县石臼所三百五十个渔民，被敌敲榨勒索北海币二千一百五十万余元；其他粮食、衣物、渔具的损失无法统计。渔村元气伤损殆尽，渔民生活陷入惨苦境地。解放后，民主政府从各方面给渔民以帮助，据不完全统计：胶东区石岛生产推进社、胶东所属渤海沿海渔区，渤海区黄骅县（原河北新海县）、胶东区滨北分区藏马县（新设县，诺城东）、滨海区日照县石臼所等渔区，半年来即先后发放渔贷北海币一亿七千一百六十九万元，粮食一百七十八万斤及大批桐油麻线等修补船只的原料，另发放农贷，盐达一亿零七百万元，救济粮食近五十万斤。渔民生产信心因之大为提高，积极修补船网下海扑鱼，获利甚丰。胶东蓬莱刘家旺村等十二个海口，今年春夏季鱼产收入总值九亿二千三百余万元；黄骅仅冯家保一村统计，半年得鱼折款十亿六千九百余万元，该村渔民生活大为改善，家家有两三年余粮。石岛海港，虽近五月中旬，渔业仍极可观，俚岛海口每日可产鳌鱼十万斤。上半年石岛渔区共产鱼一千一百三十万斤。但比去年还减产一千五百万斤。减产主要原因系由于敌军舰、飞机不断发炮轰击，扫射我各港口，致渔民不敢远出捕鱼；敌汽艇并在渔区横冲直撞驱散鱼群，捕杀渔民，使沿海渔商损失达一亿二千万元之巨。渔民生产后，政府又以大力帮助推销、出口。石岛海市结束后，渔民捕得之虾十五万斤，推进社帮助以每百斤秋后还粮五十斤的代价换给农民肥田，双方都很满意。此外政府并帮助发展渔业有关之打铁、纺线、结网等副业生产。个别地区已成立渔民会筹委会，领导渔民工作，加强海上对敌斗争，保卫渔民生产。秋季渔业生产当更有保障。
