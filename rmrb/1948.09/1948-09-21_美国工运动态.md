　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. The number of striking workers in the U.S. West Coast docks, New York truck drivers, California oil refineries and other unions has increased to over 100,000. According to Bridges, president of the dockworkers' union, on the 11th, the members of the union voted 10,740 to 376 to reject the management's requirement that union cadres sign a non-communist affidavit. The U.S. Army Department, using the excuse of shipping military supplies, announced that it would hire its own workers to load cargo on the 15th. A union spokesperson denounced this as using the Army Department to break the strike.

　　Telecommunications reported that in the Congressional committee investigating "Communist infiltration" into unions, management representatives admitted that members of the New York Fur Workers Union "very enthusiastically believe" in their Communist leaders because they have won very favorable working conditions for the workers. The Fur Workers Union has approximately 90,000 members, and its chairman is the famous Communist Gold.

　　At its closing meeting, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) passed a resolution condemning the Marshall Plan, calling it interference in other countries' internal affairs, controlled by big capitalists and for the benefit of big capitalists. At the same time, the conference passed a resolution condemning Carey, a right-wing leader of the CIO, and decided to send this resolution to the CIO's affiliated unions and the World Federation of Trade Unions, "so that workers know how Carey's own union judged him."

　　美国工运动态
    【新华社陕北十八日电】美国西岸码头、纽约卡车司机、加州炼油及其他工会工人的罢工人数，已增至十万人以上。据码头工会主席布利治十一日宣布：该工会所属会员已以一万零七百四十票对三百七十六票否决了资方对工会干部签署非共产党具结的要求。美陆军部借口装运军事物资，宣布该部将于十五日雇用自己的工人装载货物，工会发言人斥责这是用陆军部来破坏罢工。
    电通社报导，在调查“共产党渗入”工会情形的国会委员会上，资方代表承认纽约毛皮工人工会会员“非常热烈的信仰”他们的共产党领导，因为他们为工人赢得了很有利的工作条件。按毛皮工会拥有会员约九万人，其主席为著名的共产党人哥尔德。
    产联电气与无线电工人工会代表大会于闭幕会议中，通过斥责马歇尔计划的决议，称之为干涉他国内政，由大资本家所控制并且是为了大资本家利益的。大会同时通过谴责产联右翼领袖加莱的决议，并决定将此决议送交产联所属各工会及世界工联，“借使工人知道加莱自己的工会对他作了怎样的判断”。
