　　What is "Cross-Progressive Wage System"?
    Question: Comrade Chen Yun recently advocated the implementation of a cross-progressive wage system in his labor conference report. What is a "cross-progressive wage system"?
    Answer: The cross-progressive wage system is a wage grading system. Why is it called cross-progressive? Because there are two main issues in the wage grading system: first, the problem of grade arrangement; second, the problem of the difference between grades. The cross-progressive wage system means that the grade arrangement is crosswise, and the difference between grades is progressive.
    First, why is the grade arrangement crosswise? Because the labor nature of various employees (such as skilled workers, technicians, technical personnel, management personnel, etc.) in various enterprises (such as cotton weaving, machinery manufacturing, etc.) is different, the standards for stipulating wage grades are also different, either according to technical level, or according to responsibility, or according to skill level, or according to strength, etc. Since grades are stipulated separately according to various different standards, the wage grades of various enterprises and various employees will inevitably be arranged in a crisscrossing form, and it is impossible to arrange them together into a single grade sequence. A simple analogy: Assuming that the minimum wage for ordinary workers in a certain enterprise is 100, and the maximum wage is 180; the minimum wage for skilled workers may be 120, and the maximum wage may be 250; the minimum wage for technical workers may be 150, and the maximum wage may be 350. This makes them cross each other. At the same time, each type of employee is divided into several grades and levels based on skills, responsibilities, qualifications, and other conditions. The arrangement between grades is also in a crisscrossing manner, that is, the minimum wage of a first-grade, first-level worker can be lower than the maximum wage of a first-grade, second-level worker; the maximum wage of a first-grade, third-level worker can be higher than the minimum wage of a first-grade, second-level worker. Therefore, if all wage grades of various enterprises and various employees are combined into a chart, it will inevitably form a very complicated crisscrossing form. This method of grade arrangement is called a crosswise grading system. Conversely, if the wage of a first-grade, third-level worker is 150 to 210, a first-grade, second-level worker is 210 to 280, a first-grade, first-level worker is 280 to 350, or the wage of ordinary workers is 100 to 150, the wage of skilled workers is 150 to 220, and the wage of technical workers is 220 to 350, then these all become single ladder-shaped grading systems, not crosswise grading systems.
    Second, why is the difference between grades progressive? Because no matter what kind of employee, once their skills and knowledge have reached a certain level, they must make greater efforts to improve further. Therefore, a more reasonable wage system should be such that the lower the grade, the shorter the distance between grades (smaller difference); the higher the grade, the longer the distance between grades (larger difference), so as to encourage employees to strive for progress. For example: the wage of a certain worker can be divided into thirteen levels, assuming that the thirteenth level is 100 points, each level above increases by 5 points, from the eighth level and above, it is changed to an increase of 8 points per level; from the fourth level and above, it is changed to an increase of 12 points per level, until the highest level is 200 points, which is a progressive grading system. Conversely, if the distance between each level is equal and progresses according to level, it is an equal difference grading system, not a progressive grading system.
    This cross-progressive wage grading system is a reasonable wage system based on the principle of "more work, more pay" and suitable for the actual labor conditions of various enterprises and various employees. The implementation of this wage system will enable employees with various technical and production management experience and capabilities to receive reasonable treatment, and greatly encourage employees to learn. Except for small enterprises with very small production and operation scale, very simple production process, and few types of employees, which do not yet have the conditions for implementation, most large-scale enterprises and factories should implement this wage system, which is conducive to the development of production. The theory and implementation of the wage system should be discussed in separate articles, and only a simple answer can be given here.

### 什么是“交叉累进工资制”？

　　什么是“交叉累进工资制”？
    问：最近陈云同志在劳动大会报告中主张实行交叉累进工资制，什么叫做“交叉累进工资制”？
    答：交叉累进工资制是一种工资等级制度。为什么说是交叉累进呢？因为工资等级制度中主要有两个问题：一、等级排列的问题；二、等级之间的差额问题。交叉累进工资制就是说等级排列是交叉的，等级间的差额是累进的。
    第一、为什么等级排列是交叉的？因为各种企业（如棉织业机器制造业………等）之中，各种职工（如技术工人、熟练工人、技术人员、管理人员………等）的劳动性质不同，所以规定工资等级的标准也不一样，或按技术高低，或按责任轻重，或按熟练程度，或按强度大小………，既然按照各种不同标准分别规定等级，那末各种企业各种职工的工资等级必然排列成为上下交叉的形式，而不可能混在一起排列成一个单一的等级序列。简单譬喻：假设某种企业的普通工人最低工资为一○○，最高工资为一八○；熟练工人最低工资也许是一二○，最高工资可以是二五○；技术工人最低工资也许是一五○，最高工资可以是三五○。这样就使彼此成为交叉。同时每种职工又根据技能、职责、资历等等条件，在本身中，分成几等几级，等级之间，也是采取这种交叉式的排列，即是一等一级工人的最低工资可以低于一等二级的最高工资；一等三级的最高工资可以高于一等二级的最低工资。因此如将所有各种企业各种职工工资等级合并列成图表，必然形成极错综的上下交叉的形式，这种等级排列的办法名为交叉的等级制。反之，如果一等三级工人的工资是一五○至二一○，一等二级是二一○至二八○，一等一级是二八○至三五○，或者是普通工人工资是一○○至一五○，熟练工人工资是一五○至二二○，技术工人工资是二二○至三五○，这就都成为单一梯形的等级制，而不是交叉的等级制了。
    第二、为什么等级的差额是累进的？因为不论何种职工，他的技能学识已达到一定程度以后，如再求提高，就必须付出更大的努力。因此，比较合理的工资制度，应是等级愈低，等级间的距离愈短（差额小）；等级愈高，则等级间的距离随之放长（差额大），这才能鼓励职工力求进步。譬如：某种工人的工资可分为十三级，假设其第十三级为一○○分，以上每进一级增加五分，自第八级以上，改为每级增加八分；自第四级以上，改为每级增加十二分，直到最高一级为二○○分，这就是累进的等级制。反之，如果每级距离相等，按级递进，即是等差的等级制，而不是累进的等级制了。
    这种交叉的累进的工资等级制，是根据多劳多得的原则，适合各种企业各种职工实际的劳动情况的合理的工资制度，这种工资制度的实行，将使具有各种技术与生产管理经验能力之职工得到合理的待遇，并大大鼓励职工的学习。除了生产经营规模甚小，生产过程十分简单，职工种类不多的小企业，还不具有施行的条件以外，一般较大规模的企业工厂都应实行这种工资制度，对于发展生产是有利的。关于工资制度的理论与实施，应另有专文，于此只能做简单的答复。
