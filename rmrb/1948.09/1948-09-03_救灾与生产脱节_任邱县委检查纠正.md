　　Disconnection Between Disaster Relief and Production
　　Renqiu County Committee Conducts Inspection and Correction

　　[Hebei Central Electric] The Renqiu County Committee discussed and decided on the production and disaster relief work for villages affected by the floods on July 31st. On August 3rd, the director of the Promotion Cooperative led ten cadres to the disaster areas to coordinate with local cadres in leading production and disaster relief. After twelve days of work, they initially understood the local people's production base and production habits, distributed 1,200 catties of loan grain, and 6.1 million yuan in loans. They organized 34 production groups for fishing, windlassing, purchasing livestock, spinning thread, transportation and sales, carpentry, carting, weaving cloth, and weaving mats, and also motivated a lot of private capital. Through the promotion of "frugality to survive the famine," they gradually changed the masses' idea of not being thrifty.

　　The achievements of Renqiu's disaster relief work are certain, but at the same time, some serious deviations have occurred: (1) The Promotion Cooperative's policy on production and disaster relief was vague. Instead of solving the actual difficulties of the masses through organizing mass production, it wanted to simply provide disaster relief with loans. At the same time, it decided to sell the village's surplus property to solve the problem of insufficient loans. In the five key villages for production and disaster relief in the Eleventh District, the surplus property had all been sold. In Yuanguo Village in the Twelfth District, the farmers were unwilling to sell their surplus property, but the cadres leading production and disaster relief in the village insisted on selling it. (It is wrong to force the masses to sell their surplus property when they are unwilling to do so. This is not good for production and will also alienate oneself from the masses, and should be immediately inspected and corrected—Editor). The comrades leading production and disaster relief in Yuanguo Village did not thoroughly understand the situation, did not conduct a good survey of the needs of the masses, and only listened to the village cadres saying that they needed 6 million yuan, so they asked the Promotion Cooperative for 6 million yuan. (2) In the loan process, the stages of propaganda, organization, and loan issuance were mechanically separated, which was troublesome and time-consuming, and the masses were very annoyed. The chairman of the poor peasant league and four others in Baiyang Village had already organized a windlass group. When they went to the Promotion Cooperative to discuss loans, Secretary Li said: "Go back first, see how many groups your village organizes, how much money you need, and then borrow it all together." The chairman of the poor peasant league accepted the spirit of "more groups organized, more money borrowed," and that night held a mass meeting, talking about "free association to borrow money," and suddenly organized 29 groups. Comrade Cheng, who led the production and disaster relief in the village, believed that he had completed the task, and then returned to the office to get the money. (3) The cadres leading production and disaster relief were not thorough in their work. Comrades Cheng and Wang, who worked in Baiyang Village, understood the situation for twelve days, but could not even figure out the numbers. (4) Some districts still neglected production and disaster relief: There were eight villages in the Twelfth District that were completely flooded, but the main cadres of the district did not participate in the leadership of production and disaster relief. When Comrade Gao of the Promotion Cooperative approached the district committee to study production and disaster relief work, the district committee secretary said: "No matter what, you can figure it out." After the Second District arranged production and disaster relief work, they did not organize a single group in twelve days, and only took care of cleaning up surplus property, putting production and disaster relief aside.

　　In order to overcome the above shortcomings, the county committee held another meeting on the 15th of this month to study and re-clarify the policy of production and disaster relief, correcting the purely disaster relief viewpoint. It was proposed: (1) To correctly recognize that disaster relief work is an extremely complex and meticulous work, cadres must have a strong mass viewpoint, go deep into each household, specifically understand the disaster situation and production situation, and provide loans according to the urgent needs of the masses, and organize mass production. When issuing loans, propaganda should be carried out along with organization and loan issuance at any time, correcting the erroneous method of mechanically separating stages and simply emphasizing organization before loans are issued. (2) To change the purely relief viewpoint of cadres and the masses, implement the spirit of production, thrift, and self-reliance, and enable loans to truly play a role in assisting mass production.

### 救灾与生产脱节　任邱县委检查纠正

　　救灾与生产脱节
  　任邱县委检查纠正
    【冀中电】任邱县委在七月三十一日讨论决定了遭水灾村庄的生产救灾工作，八月三日，推进社主任带着十个干部分赴灾区，协同当地区干领导生产救灾。经过十二天的工夫，初步了解了当地群众生产基础和生产习惯，发放了一千二百斤贷粮，六十一万元贷款。组织起捕鱼、风弓、购买牲口、纺线、运销、木匠、大车、织布、织席等三十四个生产组，还带动了很多私资。经过宣传“节约渡荒”，逐步转变了群众不节约的思想。
    任邱救灾工作有成绩是肯定的，但同时也发生了若干严重偏向：（一）推进社对生产救灾的方针是模糊的，不是从组织群众生产中解决群众的实际困难，却想单纯用贷款赈济灾民，同时确定变卖村里的浮财，解决贷款少的困难。十一区五个生产救灾的重点村，浮财都变卖了。十二区袁果庄农民不愿卖浮财，在该村领导生产救灾的干部非让卖不可。（群众不愿变卖浮财，你硬逼着人家卖，这是错误的。这样作对生产没有好处，还会使自己脱离了群众，应立即检查纠正——编者）在袁果庄领导生产救灾的同志，没有深入了解情况，没有很好的调查群众的需要，只听到村干说需要六百万元，他就向推进社要求六百万元。（二）贷款中机械的硬分开宣传、组织、贷款等阶段，又麻烦又费时间，群众很讨厌。白洋村贫农团主席等五个人早就组织了风弓组，到推进社商量贷款时，李秘书说：“你们先回去，看你村组织多少组，用多少款，再一块贷。”贫农团主席接受了“组织的组多贷的款多”的精神，当天晚上开了个群众大会，讲了讲“自由结组来贷款”，一下子就组织了二十九个组。领导该村生产救灾的程同志便认为完成了任务，接着就回机关取款。（三）领导生产救灾的干部工作上不深入，在白洋村工作的程、王两同志，了解了十二天情况，连个数字也弄不清。（四）有的区仍忽视生产救灾：十二区全部被淹的村有八个，但该区主要干部都没参加生产救灾的领导。推进社高同志找到区委研究生产救灾工作时，区委书记说：“不管怎么着，你们看着去弄去吧。”二区布置生产救灾工作后，十二天中连一个组也没组织，光顾清理浮财，把生产救灾放在一边。
    为克服上述缺点，县委于本月十五日又开会作了研究，再次明确生产救灾的方针，纠正单纯救灾观点。提出：（一）正确认识救灾工作是极其复杂细致的工作，干部必须有坚强的群众观点，切实深入到户，具体了解灾情及生产情况，根据群众迫切需要进行贷款，组织群众生产。贷款时应随宣传随组织随时贷，纠正机械分开阶段和单纯强调组织起来才贷的错误方法。（二）转变干部和群众单纯赈济观点，贯彻生产节约自救的精神，使贷款真正起到扶助群众生产的作用。
