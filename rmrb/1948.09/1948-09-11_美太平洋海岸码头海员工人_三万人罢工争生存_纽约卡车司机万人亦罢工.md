Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: San Francisco News: The strike of dockworkers and seamen on the US Pacific Coast broke out on September 2nd. By the 3rd, three of the five dock and seamen unions on the Pacific coast, namely the International Longshore and Warehouse Union affiliated with the CIO, the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union affiliated with the CIO, and the independent Marine Firemen, Oilers, Watertenders and Wipers Association, with a total of 30,000 workers, had joined the strike. The other two unions are also holding meetings to discuss participating in the strike. Their slogan is "One for all, all for one." This strike, which insists on a 15-cent hourly wage increase, was originally scheduled for June 15th, but was postponed to today due to Truman's order to freeze wages for 80 days. The strike has paralyzed shipping in all ports along the US Pacific coast from Mexico to Canada, halting about 160 freighters. Dockworkers union leader Bridges, speaking to cheering union members on the 3rd, declared that this strike is a struggle for survival. He said: "We have bowed our heads and begged, and all we have received is cold contempt. Now, we must prepare for a four- to six-month strike. Unless it is on our terms, we will no longer negotiate with the capitalists."

Another report: Approximately 10,000 truck driver workers in New York City also went on strike on September 1st, insisting on wage increase demands. As of the 3rd, the strike was continuing and expanding. This strike is threatening the economic life of New York City, the economic center of the United States: bridges and thoroughfares are blocked, goods are piling up at railways and docks, and the supply of goods to stores is partially interrupted. The New York City Chamber of Commerce and Industry has requested Truman to issue an order to prohibit the strike for 80 days under the Taft-Hartley Act, because they fear that this strike will seriously affect the implementation of the "Marshall Plan" and American foreign trade.

　　美太平洋海岸码头海员工人
  　三万人罢工争生存
    纽约卡车司机万人亦罢工
    【新华社陕北七日电】旧金山消息：美国太平洋海岸码头工人与海员工人的罢工，已于九月二日爆发。至三日止，太平洋岸五个码头与海员工会中已有三个工会，即产联所属的国际码头与仓库工人工会、产联海员厨师与侍者工人工会及独立的生火工人工会三万人参加罢工。其他两工会亦在召开会议，讨论参加罢工事宜。他们的口号是“一人为大家，大家为一人”。这坚持每小时增资一角五分而举行的罢工，原订于六月十五日举行，但以杜鲁门下令冻结八十日而延至今日。罢工已使美国太平洋岸从墨西哥至加拿大的沿海各港口之航运陷于瘫痪，一百六十艘左右的货轮因之停顿。码头工会领袖布利治三日对向其欢呼的工会会员演说时声称：这次罢工是生存的斗争。他说：“我们曾经低头恳求，而我们得到的只是冷眼的轻蔑。现在，我们必须作四个月至六个月的罢工准备。除非依照我们的条件，我们将不再与资方谈判。”
    又讯：纽约市卡车司机工人约一万人，亦因坚持增资要求而于九月一日罢工。罢工迄三日止，仍在继续与扩大中。这一罢工正威胁着美国经济中枢——纽约市的经济生活：桥梁与通路阻滞、铁路与码头上货物山集、商店的货源部分中断。纽约市工商协会已要求杜鲁门根据塔夫脱——哈特莱法下令禁止罢工八十天，因为他们害怕这一罢工将严重影响“马歇尔计划”及美国对外贸易的实现。
