To the Editor:
    There are seven people in Zhang Xiuji's family in my village, four generations who built their fortune from scratch, with 115 mu of land. Before the incident (抗战事变, presumably meaning the start of the War of Resistance against Japan) he employed two long-term farmhands. Three members of his own family also participated in the labor, suffering alongside them. After the incident, he stopped employing farmhands. His father participated in underground anti-Japanese activities in the village and was killed by the enemy. Xiuji works in the county. Last year, the masses said that his family had feudal exploitation before the incident and liquidated him, not even leaving him a single house. Now, he cannot maintain his livelihood. What is his family's class status? How should this be resolved?

Answer:
    Since Zhang Xiuji cannot maintain his livelihood, he should first be provided with the means of subsistence and production so that he can engage in production. As for whether Zhang should be held accountable for liquidation, the materials provided are not specific and detailed enough. For example, how much land Zhang owned after the incident (what percentage of the local average landholding) and how he cultivated it are not explained. Therefore, we cannot answer you now. Please send us the detailed materials mentioned above as soon as possible so that we can reply.

　　抗战前有剥削是否清算编辑同志：
    我村张修己家中七口人，四辈劳动起家，有一百一十五亩土地，在事变前用两个长工，他自有三个人参加劳动，跟班受苦，到事变后就不用长工了。他父亲在本村参加抗日秘密活动，被敌人杀害。修己在县里工作，前年群众说他家在事变前有封建剥削将他清算了，没给留一间房子。现在生活无法维持。他家是啥成份？应如何解决？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　沙河二区张沟村清河
    答：张修己既然生活无法维持，应即先给以生活资料与生产资料，使其能从事生产，至于张某是否该还清算，因所提材料还不具体详细，如事变后张某土地占有多少（占当地土地平均数若干）与如何耕种，都未说明，故现在没法答复你，请你将上述说明的详细材料，迅速寄来，以便答复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
