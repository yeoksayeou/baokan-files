Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd. The broad masses of laboring women in the Hebei, Chahar, Jehol, and Liaoning areas have played a significant role in agricultural and sideline production, supporting the front lines, and participating in political power work. Women cadres in Koubuyingzi Village, Beipiao, mobilized 110 women from the whole village to deliver fertilizer to 300 mu of land and participate in planting 2,000 mu; most of them directly participated in major labor such as rush planting, and more than 30 women learned how to plow and filter fertilizer. Therefore, they began to break the masses' long-held view that women cannot participate in major labor. In Yutian, Baodi, Pinggu, Luanxian, Leting and other counties in eastern Hebei, spinning and weaving are the main sideline production, and in some districts, almost every household spins and weaves cloth. Eastern Jehol is a cotton-producing area, and women's spinning is also very developed in Suizhong, Chaoyang, Jinxi and other counties. According to statistics from seven villages in Suizhong and other places, more than 40 percent of the 2,300 women participated in spinning and weaving. In supporting the front lines, they not only sent their husbands and sons to join the army, but many military families also personally cultivated the land and did not require assistance. Women in the second district of Yutian, eastern Hebei, organized 54 stretchers and transported the wounded in the rain. In rural areas, women mostly take on the tasks of guarding posts, sentry duty and delivering letters. In Shun Jiao and Di Gu villages in Baodi, 58 women voluntarily participated in sabotaging enemy transportation in one instance. During the Yanggezhuang battle in Leting, more than 40 women from Bianliuhe, Liuzhuang and other villages voluntarily went to the front line to rush to transport the wounded and deliver water and food, and persisted in working on the front line. After the land reform, the women's political awareness has been greatly improved, and they actively participate in various political activities and political power work. Among the 800 farmer representatives from all over the Hebei, Chahar, Jehol, and Liaoning regions, women representatives account for 100.

　　冀察热辽劳动妇女积极参加各种工作
    【新华社东北二日电】冀察热辽地区广大劳动妇女在农、副业生产、支援前线以及参加政权工作中发挥了极大作用。北票扣卜营子村妇女干部发动了全村妇女一百一十人送了三百亩地的粪，并参加种地两千亩；其中大部直接参加了抢种等主要劳动，有卅余名妇女学会了扶犁滤粪。因此，开始打破了群众历来认为妇女不能参加主要劳动的看法。冀东玉田、宝坻、平谷、滦县、乐亭等县多以纺织作为主要副业生产，有些区几乎是家家纺线户户织布。热东为产棉区，绥中、朝阳、锦西等县妇纺亦极发达。据绥中等地七个村的统计，二千三百名妇女中，有百分之四十以上参加了纺织。在支援前线中，她们不但送夫送子参军，而且不少军属亲自耕种，不要助耕。冀东玉田二区妇女，曾组织了五十四付担架，冒雨转送伤员。农村中，站岗放哨以及送信等工作也大多由妇女担任。宝坻的瞬角、抵古二村，一次有五十八名妇女自动参加了破袭敌人交通。乐亭杨各庄战斗时，边流河、刘庄等村有四十余名妇女自动上火线抢运伤员，送水送饭，在火线上坚持工作。土改后，妇女政治觉悟大为提高，积极参加各种政治活动和政权工作。冀察热辽全区各地八百农民代表中，妇女代表即占一百名。
