To the Editor:
    Qian Li, in the Second District of Shouzhang, is an extremely poor village with no landlords or rich peasants. During the re-examination, in order to mobilize the masses, five middle-peasant households were struggled against. None were driven out of their homes, and their lives are not difficult. Should they be compensated in this case? If they are to be compensated, the village has no fruits of labor, and if we ask the poor peasants to take them out again, they won't agree (nor will the village cadres). They say, "This is more property than our poor peasant families have!" Is it okay not to compensate them?
    Also: During the re-examination last year, Wang Zhencai, a middle peasant from Mengzhuang, in the Third District of Shouzhang, had all his farm tools and property confiscated, including an ox he was raising. On a certain day in June, the village cadres wanted to sell two willow trees on his ancestral grave, and then buy an ox to compensate him. They discussed it with Zhencai, but he was unwilling. Is it okay for the village cadres to force the sale?
                                                                                                                      Wang Zhenshan

    Answer: 1. As mentioned in the letter, in poor villages like Li Village, where there are no landlords or old-fashioned rich peasants, it is wrong to struggle against middle peasants in order to mobilize the masses. Such villages, having no landlords or rich peasants, should not engage in struggle. If some middle peasants have land exceeding the village's average landholding by a factor of one, an adjustment can be made on a truly voluntary basis for the middle peasant (not exceeding one-fourth of their land). At the same time, the higher-level government should vigorously support mass production and solve the farmers' difficulties. The five middle-peasant households that have already been wrongly struggled against should first be acknowledged as having been wronged, and the wrongly assigned class status should be publicly corrected. As for compensation, the solution can be discussed and resolved by all the villagers. If, as the letter says, "none were driven out of their homes, and their lives are not difficult," and the village has no fruits of labor, and the wrongly struggled households can agree not to be compensated or to be compensated less, then no compensation or less compensation can be given. If the wrongful struggle is severe and the individual cannot maintain production and livelihood, and the wrongly struggled household is indeed a middle peasant who started from labor, then every effort should be made to compensate them. It would be wrong to shelve the matter and not resolve it because the masses and village cadres do not understand. However, in this work, we must be careful not to discourage the poor and hired peasants. On the contrary, we should rely closely on the poor and hired peasants to carry out compensation. We must first educate the poor and hired peasants, explaining repeatedly so that they understand the positive significance of correcting deviations, which is to develop production, and this is also beneficial to the poor and hired peasants. And from analyzing the causes of the mistakes and the methods of correction, we can improve the class consciousness of cadres and the masses, so that they can recognize what is the policy of our party, what is the deviation in execution, and finally achieve the goal of uniting all strata to develop production.
    2. Infringing on the interests of middle peasants is not permitted by policy. Compensating wrongly struggled middle peasants is to strengthen unity and develop production, so deviations should be corrected. If Wang Zhencai is indeed a middle peasant who started from labor, the village cadres should immediately use other reasonable methods to compensate for his losses. Selling the trees on Wang Zhencai's grave and then buying an ox to compensate him for his losses is not appropriate.
                                                                                                                                             —Editor

### 没有地富的穷村也不应斗争中农

专栏：询问与答复

　　没有地富的穷村也不应斗争中农编辑同志：
    寿张二区前李，是个极贫苦的村子，没有地主富农，复查时为了发动群众，斗了五家中农，都没扫地出门，生活也不困难，象这样是否还补偿他呢？若要补偿吧，村里又没有果实，再叫贫农拿出来，他们都不通（村干也不通），他们说：“这比咱贫农的家业还大哩！”不补偿是否行呢？
    又：寿张三区孟庄中农王振才在去年复查时，他的各样农具财产都被没收啦，喂着一头牛也没收啦。六月某日，村干要卖他老坟上的两棵柳树，然后再买牛补偿他，与振才商量，他不愿意，村干强迫卖了是否能行？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　王振山
    答：一、如来信所说李村那样没有地主、旧式富农的穷苦村，为了发动群众而斗争中农是错误的。这样的村子，既没有地主富农，就不应实行斗争，如果有的中农土地数超过全村土地平均数一倍上下者，在中农真正自愿的条件下，可调剂一部（以不超过其土地的四分之一为限）。同时上级政府应大力扶助群众生产，解决农民的困难。目前已经错斗了五户中农，首先应向其承认错误，错订的成份应公开地加以订正。至于补偿办法，可由全村农民商讨解决，如确如来信所说“都未扫地出门，生活也不困难”，村中又没有了果实，而错斗户也能同意不补或少补，可以不补或少补。如错斗严重，其本人不能维持生产与生活，而错斗户又确系劳动起家的中农，则应尽量设法补偿，如因群众村干思想不通而搁下不予解决则是错误的。但在这一工作中，必须注意不要给贫雇农泼冷水，相反地应该紧紧依靠贫雇进行补偿，必须首先在贫雇农中进行教育，反复解释，使他们认识到纠偏的积极意义，是为了发展生产，这样对贫雇农也是有好处的。并从分析错误原因及纠正办法中，提高干部与群众的阶级觉悟，使他们认清什么是我党的政策，什么是执行中的偏向，最后达到团结各阶层发展生产的目的。
    二、侵犯中农利益是政策所不允许的。补偿错斗中农，是为了加强团结发展生产，所以有了偏向就应该纠正，如王振才确系劳动起家的中农，该村干部应即另行以其他合理办法，补偿他的损失。如卖了王振才坟上的树，再买牛补偿其本人损失的办法，是不妥当的。
