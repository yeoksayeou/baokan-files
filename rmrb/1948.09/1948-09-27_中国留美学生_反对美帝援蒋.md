　　Chinese Students in the United States
  　Oppose American Imperialist Aid to Chiang Kai-shek
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Belated news from New York: Chinese students in the United States oppose American imperialist aid to the Kuomintang reactionaries in slaughtering the Chinese people. The "Chinese Christian Student Association" held a summer conference in Medford, New Jersey in June, appealing to the American people to stop American military aid to the Kuomintang and opposing the American policy of cultivating Japan's war potential. This action has attracted the attention of the American people. Note: This association is composed of Chinese students in the United States, with approximately one thousand members, accounting for about one-third of the total number of Chinese students in the United States.
    Another dispatch: Chinese and American students refused to intern at a factory in Connecticut and published a statement in newspapers such as the Christian Science Monitor, explaining the reasons for their refusal. They stated that they discovered the factory was manufacturing munitions for the Chinese Kuomintang government to slaughter the Chinese people; the statement expressed their "opposition to the American military intervention in China policy."

　　中国留美学生
  　反对美帝援蒋
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】纽约迟到消息：留美中国学生反对美帝国主义援助国民党反动派屠杀中国人民。“中国基督教学生联合会”六月间在新泽西州之麦德福特举行夏令会时，曾向美国人民呼吁停止美国对国民党的军事援助，反对美国培植日本战争潜力的政策。此一行动已引起美国人民注意。按：该会为留美中国学生组成，会员约千名，约占中国留美学生总数三分之一。
    另讯：中国及美国学生曾拒绝往康涅狄格州某工厂实习，并在基督教科学箴言报等报纸上发表声明，说明拒绝前往的原因，是他们发现该工厂正为中国国民党政府制造军火来屠杀中国人民；声明表示他们“反对美国军事干涉中国政策”。
