Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. TASS reports: Moscow, the Soviet capital, bid a final farewell on the afternoon of the 2nd to the great citizen and patriot, and outstanding leader of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state, Zhdanov. From 4 PM on the 1st, when Zhdanov's remains were placed in the Hall of Trade Unions, until 4 PM on the 2nd, half a million people had visited the hall to pay their respects. The line of people waiting outside the Hall of Trade Unions stretched for several kilometers. Ministers, representatives of the Supreme Soviet, labor heroes, Soviet heroes, outstanding scientists, writers, and artists took turns standing guard.

　　At 5:20 PM on the 2nd, Stalin, Molotov, Beria, Voroshilov, Malenkov, and others took the final watch. Subsequently, Stalin and other party and government leaders carefully carried the coffin out of the Hall of Columns and placed it on a gun carriage, and the funeral procession proceeded towards Red Square. At the front of the procession was a long line of people carrying wreaths and holding the various medals and decorations Zhdanov had received during his lifetime, shining brightly against the scarlet backdrop. This was the great motherland's high praise for its excellent son. Red Square and its adjacent streets were filled with people from all over the country, and the troops stood in neat formations, waiting solemnly. When the procession reached Lenin's Mausoleum, Stalin and the party and government leaders carried the coffin off the gun carriage and placed it on a high platform, then ascended to the podium of Lenin's Mausoleum.

　　At 6 PM, the memorial service began. Molotov first gave a eulogy on behalf of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Council of Ministers. He briefly described the life of the deceased, pointing out that "Zhdanov was an outstanding Marxist theorist. His reports on literature, art, and philosophy were a major contribution to the development of Marxism-Leninism. By pointing out new paths for our socialist culture and in many ways assisting in eliminating the shortcomings existing in these fields, he set an example of a Bolshevik leader who combined participation in daily construction work with a deep study of Marxist theoretical problems." Finally, Molotov bid farewell to Zhdanov with deep sorrow. Following him, Marshal Govorov, who had fought alongside Zhdanov in Leningrad, reported on the great leadership role he played in the Battle of Leningrad. After the speech by Popov, secretary of the Moscow Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and chairman of the funeral committee, the memorial service concluded.

　　To the sound of a funeral march, Stalin and the party and government leaders lifted the coffin and carried it to the Kremlin wall, where it was buried in the cemetery of outstanding leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state. At 6:40 PM, the national anthem was played, the coffin was lowered into the ground, and a three-volley salute was fired. The flag on the roof of the Supreme Soviet Building of the Soviet Union was slowly raised to the top of the pole, and the funeral came to an end. Stalin and the party and government leaders then re-ascended Lenin's Mausoleum and began to review the mighty Soviet army marching in formation. Millions of Muscovites marched in columns along with the army, and the eyes of the soldiers and working people were all fixed on the great Stalin. Under his leadership, the Soviet people are confidently marching towards new victories for communism.

　　百万人民挤满红场
  　悲痛安葬日丹诺夫
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社报导：苏京莫斯科于二日下午最后送别伟大的公民与爱国者、布尔什维克党与苏维埃国家的杰出领袖日丹诺夫。自一日下午四时日丹诺夫遗体停放职工会大厦之时起，至二日下午四时之一昼夜间，已有五十万人民赴灵堂瞻仰日丹诺夫遗容，职工会大厦门外伫候的行列长达数公里。部长们、最高苏维埃代表们、劳动英雄们、苏联英雄们、杰出的科学家、作家、艺术家们，更番前往守灵。
    二日下午五时二十分，由斯大林、莫洛托夫、贝利亚、伏罗希洛夫、马林科夫等最后守灵。随后，斯大林与党政领袖们谨慎地将灵柩抬出圆柱大厅，并安放在炮车上，出殡的行列即向红场进发。行列的前面是一长串的人群，他们抬着花圈，捧着日丹诺夫生前获得的各种勋章、奖章，在猩红的衬底上闪耀生光，这是伟大的祖国对其优秀儿子的崇高褒奖。红场及其毗邻的街道上挤满了来自全国各地的人民，军队排成划一的方阵，肃立伫候。当行列到达列宁墓前时，斯大林与党政领袖将灵柩抬出炮车，安置于高台上，旋即升至列宁墓讲台。
    六时正，追悼会开始。莫洛托夫首先代表联共（布）中央与部长会议致辞。他简述了死者的生平，指出“日丹诺夫是出类拔萃的马克思主义理论家。他关于文学、艺术和哲学的报告，是对发展马列主义的重大贡献。由于指出了我国社会主义文化的新道路，并多方面助成了消除这些领域中存在着的缺点，他树立了参加每日建设工作和深刻研究马克思主义理论问题相结合的布尔什维克领袖之典范。”最后，莫洛托夫以深沉的悲哀向日丹诺夫告别。继之，曾与日丹诺夫在列宁格勒并肩作战的戈沃罗夫元帅，报告他在列宁格勒战役中所起的伟大领导作用。在联共（布）莫斯科党委书记、治丧委员会主席波波夫演讲后，追悼会遂告结束。
    在葬仪进行曲声中，斯大林与党政领袖扶起灵柩，抬至克里姆林宫墙下安葬布尔什维克党与苏维埃国家杰出领袖之墓地。六时四十分，国歌高奏，灵柩下葬，排炮齐鸣三响，苏联最高苏维埃大厦屋顶的半旗即徐徐升至杆顶，葬仪至此结束。斯大林与党政领袖又重升列宁墓，开始检阅排成行列式前进的强大苏军，成百万的莫斯科市民随着军队列队前进，战士们与劳动人民的眼睛都注视着伟大的斯大林，苏维埃人民在他的领导下，满怀信心地朝着共产主义的新胜利前进。
