Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Comprehensive report: Salt production in Bohai and Southern Liaoning has greatly increased after restoration and development. According to statistics from the first two months of this spring, the 1,025 salt fields in the Chengkou District Salt Field of Wudi County, Bohai, produced 70 million jin of salt, equivalent to the total output of the entire last year. The salt farmers in Chengkou started working on the salt fields around the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, half a month earlier than in previous years. In the past, there was a water shortage period from Grain Rain to the Beginning of Summer, but this spring, 2,800 zhang of water diversion ditches were dug, making the seawater inexhaustible, which greatly helped increase production. Influenced by the development of the salt industry in Huanghua (Xinhua) County, the masses in the surrounding six counties of Dongguang, Huimin, etc., have developed the transportation industry from salt-carrying porters. More than 570 old salt workers from the Kuomintang-controlled areas also fled to participate in salt production. The salt fields in Southern Liaoning have officially started production since the Spring Equinox this year. As of late July, a total of more than 380,000 tons of salt have been produced, exceeding the original target by more than 80,000 tons. The area has now restored more than 4,100 salt fields, employing more than 11,000 salt workers, repairing and adding more than 1,100 horsepower of electric power, building 64.3 kilometers of small railways, 610 trains, 1,500 beach houses, and five transformer substations. Workers have also established a new attitude towards labor. For example, the workers of the Baijiakou salt field in Fuxian County have voluntarily proposed to increase production three times, reaching more than 30% above the original plan, and the quantity and quality have exceeded the period of the puppet Manchukuo. In addition, after the Gaiping salt field started production this year, the workers also voluntarily increased working hours, digging more than 170 tidal ditches day and night. Production and administrative cadres have also gone deep into the salt fields to learn technical operations. At the end of the spring production, the Salt Affairs Bureau conducted a general democratic inspection to consolidate the foundation of salt production and solicited workers' opinions on production management. The salt fields in Southern Liaoning are now actively preparing for autumn production.

　　渤海、辽南盐业增产
    【新华社陕北十九日电】综合报导：渤海、辽南各地盐业经过恢复和发展，产量大增。渤海的无棣县埕口区盐场一千零二十五付海滩，据今年初春两个月统计，即产盐七千万斤，等于去年全年总产量。埕口盐民于农历正月十五前后即下滩工作，比往年提早半月。往年从谷雨到立夏是缺水期间，今春挖了二千八百丈的引水沟，使海水用之不尽，对增产帮助极大。在黄骅（新海）县盐业发展的影响下，附近东光、惠民等六县群众，由运盐驮脚而发展了运输业。国民党统治区的五百七十余个老盐工，亦逃来参加晒盐。辽南盐场自今年春分正式开晒，至七月下旬止，共计产盐三十八万余吨，超过原定任务八万余吨。该地现已恢复盐田四千一百余付方，用有盐工一万一千余人，修复、添置电动力一千一百匹马力以上，修建小铁道六十四点三公里，火车六百十余辆，滩房一千五百余幢，变电所五处。工人并树立了新的劳动态度，如复县百家口盐滩工人，曾三次自动提出增加产量达原定计划百分之三十以上，数量质量均超过伪满时期。又盖平盐滩于今年开晒后，工人亦自动增加劳动时间，昼夜掏挖潮水沟一百七十余条。生产行政干部更深入盐滩，学习技术作业。在春晒结束时，盐务局为奠定盐业生产基础，进行了普遍的民主大检查，征求工人对生产管理的意见。辽南盐场刻正积极准备秋晒工作。
