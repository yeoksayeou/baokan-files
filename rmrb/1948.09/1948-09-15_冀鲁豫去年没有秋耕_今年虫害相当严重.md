(Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram) Due to the heavy war service tasks in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region last year, many areas did not carry out autumn cultivation. Coupled with the initial discovery of insect pests and ineffective extermination efforts, the insect plague this year is quite severe. According to reports from local correspondents, meat worms eating corn first occurred in more than 20 villages in the first district of Neihuang on July 19. Subsequently, it was discovered in the first and sixth districts of Kunwu on August 7. On August 13, Dongming first discovered the problem in the third and eighth districts, gradually spreading to more than 200 villages in the first and second districts. Following this, cotton worms became prevalent in four districts of Chiping. Around August 16, insect plagues occurred in all eight districts of Shou Zhang, except for villages with irrigation. In the Shangnan sub-district of the first district, all the corn in the small districts was eaten up. Because the leadership initially believed that insects would not cause much harm, they underestimated the insect plague, leading to a widespread disaster throughout the county. As of September 5, in addition to the aforementioned counties and districts, insect plagues had also been discovered in over 300 square li in the third and fifth districts of Fanxian. In Yanggu, all five districts (the first, second, and third districts alone cover 150 square li) were affected. Four districts in Puyang (with the third district being more severe). Partial villages in four districts of Nanfeng. Partial villages in three districts of Puyang. All six districts of Xiaofeng. Partial villages in individual districts of Weihe. In Nanle, nine villages in the fifth district discovered the problem and immediately took action, but more than 500 mu of crops had already been eaten. Most of the four districts of Kunwu were affected, as were six districts of Juancheng, partial villages in one district of Linze, partial villages in four districts of Gaoling, more than a dozen villages in two districts of Quhe, an area of over ten li around the seventh district of Huaxian, certain areas of Weinan (four districts of Chiping and eight districts of Dong'a), an area of over 20 square li around the area, and individual villages in one district of Liaoyang (newly established county). Partial villages in two districts of Xuji. In total, 23 counties and 69 districts have been affected (it is estimated that some areas have not yet reported). Some areas have mostly suppressed the plague, some are still fighting it, some have eradicated it completely, and some are still developing. The types of insects include mole crickets, corn borers, date weevils, date stink bugs, armyworms, cutworms, grubs, scarabs, locusts, and small locusts, with armyworms and small locusts being the most devastating. They can eat all the leaves of grain and corn in just a few days. In Zhangzhuang and Liukui Village in the first district of Shou Zhang, people initially believed in gods and remained on the sidelines, failing to organize the masses to fight the insects. As a result, more than 35 qing of crops were eaten up in just a few days. In Dongming, only the third and eighth districts were initially affected. However, because the county was busy organizing the emergency repair of the Gaocun dangerous section of the Yellow River at the time, they did not pay enough attention to the insect plague, which gradually spread to many villages in the first and second districts, eating up more than 600 mu of crops. After the occurrence of this insect plague, the Sixth Special Commissioner's Office issued instructions on August 13, calling for strict prevention of insect disasters and pointing out that if insect plagues are discovered in various places, forces should be immediately organized to eliminate them within a limited time and that there should be no delay, causing the disaster area to expand. It also stated that in the process of organizing the masses to kill pests, experience should be drawn, and reports should be made at any time for dissemination. The District Party Committee issued a call on August 27 to eliminate insect pests and protect autumn seedlings. Subsequently, the Administrative Office, the Eighth and Ninth Special Commissioner's Offices, and some local party committees and county party committees also issued emergency insect catching instructions and notices. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily also issued an editorial, "Make Every Effort to Eliminate Insect Pests," calling on the leading organs in various places to pay attention. Many areas implemented and promoted the spirit and experience of locust catching in 1944, organizing the masses to resolutely fight the insects, and achieved rapid annihilation results, breaking the masses' superstitious views of waiting and seeing, believing that they were "divine insects" that "multiply the more they are killed," and the backward views of not wanting to organize and everyone looking after themselves, and correcting the cadres' paralysis and waiting and seeing, and absurd sayings such as using "the masses are backward" and "superstitious" as excuses. For example, after discovering insects, the Yanggu District Sub-committee immediately arranged for cadres to inspect and immediately led the masses to catch them. Although the leaders in Fanxian started fighting early, several villages in the first district were still eaten up. The dense insects discovered in Chiping have already been dealt with. Louying in the eighth district of Xuji rescued more than 1,100 mu. The Shanghe Third District Sub-committee initially did not pay enough attention and had more than 50 mu eaten up. Later, they persuaded the masses and rescued more than 800 mu. In addition, the Xuyi Seventh Team and training class of the Direct Hospital, and other organs and schools, participated in the insect eradication campaign after discovering insects, leading the masses to fight them and achieved great results. However, some leading organs and cadres were paralyzed and wavering about the insect plague, and the masses were superstitious and did not act, leaving them helpless. For example, in Shou Zhang, a small number of insects were discovered on August 17, the number of insects increased by August 22, the county made the decision to fight them on August 26, the district cadres were mobilized on August 29, and the masses were not widely mobilized until August 31. The cadres of the first district were still holding meetings to discuss other work when insects crawled into the courtyard, causing the insect plague to spread throughout the county, although the losses were recovered. Some experience has been gained in insect catching: During publicity and education, it must be pointed out that this year's insect plague is the reproduction of a small number of pests in the past. Killing one today is equivalent to killing hundreds or thousands in the future or next year, breaking the nonsense of "heavenly insects," "divine insects," and "the more they are killed, the more they multiply." If necessary, completely eliminate one piece first to protect the seedlings, so as to lay the foundation for the masses' confidence and improve their enthusiasm, and then catching them will be faster. In areas where autumn seedlings are well protected, the leaders pay attention, the cadres personally take action and combine with the organization of the masses to fight the insects, and the enthusiasm for fighting the insects persists. In addition to organizing forces to fight, the masses in Liukui Village in Shou Zhang are carrying out weeding and plowing. The Nanfeng Third District is carrying out the work of digging and catching moths to prevent insect roots from harming next year's production.

　　冀鲁豫去年没有秋耕
  　今年虫害相当严重
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区由于去年的战勤任务繁重，不少地区未进行秋耕，兼之开始发现虫害，扑灭不力，致今年虫灾相当严重。据各地通讯员报导，首先七月十九日在内黄一区二十多个村发生肉虫吃棒子，嗣后昆吾一、六区于八月七日发现。东明于八月十三日首先在三、八区发现，逐渐蔓延到一、二区二百多个村，继之茌平四个区普遍发生棉虫。八月十六日前后，寿张八个区除上水的村外，均发生虫灾，其中一区尚南小区中小区的棒子全部吃光。因为领导上开始认为虫子生不了多大害，轻视虫害，致使虫灾普遍全县。截至九月五日止，除上述各县区外，已发现虫灾的范县三、五区有三百多方里。阳谷全县五个区（只一、二、三区就方圆一百五十方里）。濮县四个区（其中三区较严重）。南峰四个区的部分村庄。濮阳三个区的部分村庄。消丰全县六个区。卫河个别区的部分村庄。南乐五区九个村发现后即打下去，但已有五百多亩庄稼被吃掉。昆吾四个区大部。鄄城六个区。临泽一个区的部分村庄。高陵四个区部分村庄。曲河二个区有十几个村。滑县七区周围十余里。卫南某些地区（茌平四个区东阿八区）周围二十多方里。聊阳（新设县）一个区个别村庄。徐冀二个区部分村庄。共计二十三个县六十九个区（估计尚有某些地区未有报来）。有的已大部打下，有的正在扑打，有的已消灭光了，有的正在发展。虫类包括蝼蛄、钻心虫、枣八角，枣步曲、黏虫、夜盗虫、蛴螬、密虫、蝗虫、＠蝗，其中尤以黏虫、＠蝗为最厉害。几天之中，可将谷叶棒子叶吃光。寿张一区张庄、刘魁斋两村，开始信神观望，不组织群众扑打，不几天庄稼被吃掉三十五顷之多。东明只三八区发现，因县里当时正组织抢修黄河高村险工，未重视虫害，渐蔓延到一、二区的许多村庄，吃掉六百多亩庄稼。在此种虫害发生后，六专署于八月十三日发出指示，号召严防虫灾，并指出各地如发现虫灾，应马上组织力量限期消灭，不得稍有迟延，使灾区扩大，并须在组织群众力量扑杀害虫过程中，吸取经验，随时报告，以便广播。区党委于八月二十七日发出消除虫害保护秋苗的号召，接着行署八、九专署及有的地委、县委亦先后发出紧急捕虫指示和通知，冀鲁豫日报亦发出“尽一切努力消除虫害”的社论，号召各地领导机关的注意，有不少地区贯彻和发挥了一九四四年捕蝗的精神和经验，组织群众坚决扑打，便取得了迅速歼灭的成绩，打破了群众迷信观望、认为是“神虫”“越打越多”和不愿组织起来各顾各的落后观点，纠正了干部麻痹观望，借口“群众落后”“迷信”等荒谬说法。象阳谷一区分委会于发现虫子后，立即布置干部检查，马上领导群众捕扑下去。范县虽然领导打的早，在一区也有几个村吃光。茌平发现密虫，已打下去。徐冀八区娄营抢救了一千一百多亩。尚和三区分委会开始注意不够，被吃掉五十多亩，后来说服群众，抢救了八百多亩。另外××直属医院徐翼七队和训练班等机关学校，均在发现虫后，参加了灭虫运动，领导群众扑打，收了很大成绩。但有的领导机关和干部，对虫害麻痹观望动摇，群众迷信不动，自己束手无策。象寿张八月十七日发现少数虫子，到二十二日虫子就多了，到二十六日县里才下决心打，二十九日才推动起区干，到三十一日才普遍推动群众打。一区干部，当虫子爬到院里时，还在开会讨论别的工作，致虫害蔓延全县，损失虽以挽回。捕虫中已得到点滴经验：在宣传教育时，必须指出，今年的虫害是过去少数的害虫的繁衍，今天打死一个，就等于打死以后或明年的几百几千个，打破“天虫”“神虫”“越打越多”等无稽之谈。必要时先彻底消灭一片，保住苗，以奠定群众信心，提高群众情绪，再捕时就快了。秋苗保的好的地区，则是领导重视、干部亲自动手与组织群众扑打相结合，打虫热情才坚持了下去。各虫灾区除组织力量扑打外，在寿张刘魁斋群众，正进行锄草地犁草地。南峰三区正进行挖蛾扑蛾的工作，以防虫根遗害明年生产。
