(Jinan Telegram) Due to the Ji County Party Committee's prompt leadership in organizing over 400 villages to engage in ten days of pest extermination, the insect infestation has now been completely and thoroughly eradicated. After discovering insect eggs and armyworms in Yangcun Village and other villages in the seventh district, the County Party Committee immediately notified all districts to conduct thorough inspections and promptly mobilized the masses to eliminate them. Within six or seven days, armyworms were found throughout the county (leaving only three or four villages unaffected). In Jintai Village in the fifth district, 500 mu of the 560 mu of millet was consumed. 122 villages suffered heavy damage, accounting for over a quarter of the county's villages. According to incomplete statistics, in 338 villages, 318,100 mu of millet were consumed, and over 50,000 mu had their leaves half-eaten. In this serious situation, the County Party Committee immediately instructed all districts to cease all other work and concentrate all efforts on leading the masses to thoroughly eliminate the armyworms. It was also decided to establish county, district, and village-level pest control headquarters or committees to actively lead the masses in pest extermination. Initially, the masses had many ideological concerns. Some believed that "you can't catch them all, and they will ruin the crops anyway." Others said, "This is fate, the more you catch, the more there are." To break through the masses' thinking, the County Party Committee put forward the slogan "Catch one less, get one less. Fight the armyworms for our rice bowls!" and educated the masses on the concept of the collective, explaining that "the armyworms are alive, they will eat yours after they finish theirs." For the masses whose millet had been eaten by armyworms, slogans such as "If you can't save the millet, save the corn!" were put forward to deeply educate the masses and increase their confidence in exterminating the pests. They also organized activists in each village to take the lead and organize the broad masses to actively catch and kill the pests. As of the 24th of last month, all armyworms in the county had been completely eradicated.

　　县委领导抓的紧
  　冀县虫害迅速扑灭
    【冀南电】冀县的虫害，因县委迅速领导四百余村群众进行了十多天捕杀，现已全部彻底扑灭。该县开始在七区杨村等村发现虫卵和黏虫后，县委即急告各区认真检查，并立即发动群众扑灭。六七天内黏虫在全县普遍发现（只剩三、四个村没有）。五区吉金台村五百六十亩谷，吃光五百亩。受重灾村一百二十二个，占全县村庄四分之一强。据不完全统计：三百三十八个村中，吃光谷子三十一万八千一百亩，吃半叶的五万多亩。在此严重情况下，该县县委立即指示各区停止一切工作，集中全力领导群众彻底消灭黏虫。并决定建立县、区、村捕虫指挥部或捕虫委员会，积极领导群众捕打。开始时，群众都有不少思想顾虑，有的认为“捉不完就把庄稼糟踏光了”。有的说：“这是天意，越捉越多”。为了打通群众思想，县委提出“打一个少一个，向黏虫争夺饭碗子”的口号，并向群众进行整体观念的教育，说明“黏虫是活的，吃完他的吃你的。”对被黏虫吃光谷子的群众提出：“保不住谷子保棒子”等口号，深入教育群众，提高了群众灭虫信心。又组织各村积极分子带头，组织广大群众，积极捕打。截至上月二十四日，已将全县黏虫全部扑灭。
