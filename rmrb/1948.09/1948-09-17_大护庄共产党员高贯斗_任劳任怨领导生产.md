[Jizhong Telegram] Gao Guandou, a labor hero and Communist Party member from Dahu Village in Shen County, is enthusiastically leading the village's farmers in production, restoring and developing cooperative mutual aid. During the land reform and party rectification in the village this year, his class status was incorrectly elevated due to unclear standards, and he was removed from his position, his Party membership was suspended, his door was sealed, and he was detained for ten days. Later, the masses in the village realized the mistake and quickly unsealed his door, released him, and the branch restored his Party membership. After Gao Guandou came out, he was not pessimistic, disappointed, or prone to complaining. Instead, he was determined to lead the village's production well. (This spirit of being clear-headed, strong, actively working for the Party and the people is worth learning from by other comrades – Editor). Because during the Party rectification, some people said that his organization of mutual aid was "not seeking interest or getting up early," "only trying to please superiors, and simply engaging in paternalistic control." Gao Guandou humbly examined himself, constantly thinking: this year's organization of production must not be paternalistic, but must still be vibrant. Later, he came up with a new method. Gao Guandou, Zhang Maorong, Ma Wenshang and others, on the basis of the existing agricultural mutual aid group, borrowed 30,000 yuan, each contributing two bags of wheat to turn into funds, and organized a "Promotion Group" (also known as the Agricultural Implement Cooperative) to promote other groups and cooperatives.

The Promotion Group was responsible for Gao Guandou's management of buying and selling, combined with Zhang Maowei Luo's sideline handicrafts, and sales were made outside the village. After its establishment, the group developed its business according to the season and the needs of the farmers. For example, the masses had already hung up their hoes and were preparing for the autumn harvest, and they needed some agricultural tools, especially some newly emancipated farmers who were very short of tools. Gao Guandou and the others bought a batch of winnowing fans, sieves, fork handles, brooms, etc. Gao Guandou also had some family skills and repaired furniture very sturdily, which the masses were very willing to buy. When it was time to plant vegetables, they saw that the masses lacked vegetable seeds, so they bought a batch. They also saw that the masses had dug many new pigsties and planned to make fertilizer, so they bought a batch of pigs and sold them to the masses at low prices. Gao Guandou saw that many women on the street were idle, so he borrowed a portion of cotton from the county promotion agency and lent it to the women and weaving groups. It was stipulated that the first loan would be used as capital, and the spun thread would be exchanged for cotton later, so that there would be more and more. This brought up more than sixty women to spin thread. Gao Guandou often taught them how to spin fine thread and weave good cloth, and the spun thread and woven cloth would be sold to the Promotion Group. From March to now, in six months, twenty-seven bolts of cloth have been woven, and after seven bolts were woven for relatives for free, the remaining cloth was sold for 370 jin of rice. They said: "If it weren't for Gao Guandou's constant guidance, we wouldn't even know where to start, and we wouldn't be able to do it for so long. That day when the thread broke, he would help us with cotton, and solve any difficulties at any time." Under the influence of the village, nearby Nanwang Village, Yanggong Bridge Village, etc., also went to Gao Guandou's promotion team to exchange cotton for spinning thread.

Gao Guandou's promotion team also paid attention to supporting the recovery of the cooperatives that had collapsed. For example, the sesame oil cooperative organized by Gao Xingzhou and others, because the division of labor and work measurement were unclear, and they did not achieve equal value for both parties, some only cared about doing their own work and eating the oil mill's food. Some worked very hard but received the same dividends as others, resulting in everyone becoming negative. Gao Guandou introduced the experience of the promotion team to them. Later, the society cleared up the old accounts and specifically divided the work, and determined the dividend method according to the size of the labor force. In this way, everyone worked very enthusiastically. The society also plans to expand its capital recently. In addition, the village's weaving cooperative also almost collapsed, but it was not collapsed after Gao Guandou's assistance. All five cooperatives in the village are very active in business under Gao Guandou's leadership.

In addition, Gao Guandou also led farmers to transform alkaline land. He saw that the alkaline land of Li Daqi, Sun Hailin and others did not grow crops for many years, so he often went to their homes to mobilize them and inspire their interest in transforming alkaline land. He also mobilized alkaline land households to pull soil to their own land to seep down the alkalinity, and cultivate it once after a rain. Now, the crops growing in the old alkaline land of Sun Hailin and others are very strong. In this way, it also inspired other households to transform alkaline land.

　　大护庄共产党员高贯斗
  　任劳任怨领导生产
    【冀中电】深县大护庄劳动英雄高贯斗，热心领导本村农民生产，恢复与发展合作互助。今年该村土改整党时，因为订成份的标准不明确，提高了他的成份，并被撤了职，停止了党籍，门也封了，还被扣了十天。后来该村群众知道作错了，很快的给他启了封，把他放出来，支部又恢复了他的党籍。高贯斗出来后，并没悲观失望乱发牢骚，而且他决心把本村生产领导好。（这种清醒坚强为党、为人民积极工作的精神值得其他同志学习——编者）因整党时有人说他组织互助是“不图利息不打早起”、“光为往上级讨好，净包办代替”。高贯斗便虚心的检讨了自己，不断的想：今年组织生产既不包办代替，又要搞的红火。后来，便想了一个新办法，由高贯斗、张茂荣、马文尚等几家，在前有的农业互助组的基础上，又贷了三万元的款，每家拿出两口袋麦子变成款，组织了个“推进组”（又名农具合作社），以推动别的组和合作社。
    推进社由高贯斗负责张罗买卖，结合着张马尾罗的副业手工，外出销售。成立后，便根据季节和农民需要开展业务，如群众已挂了锄都准备秋收，需要一些农具，尤其是一些新翻身的农民农具很缺。高贯斗他们便买了一批簸箩、筛子、杈把、扫帚等。高贯斗又会些家传手艺，把家具收拾的很结实，群众都很愿买。种菜时他们见到群众缺菜种，便买了一批。他们又见到群众挖了好些新猪圈打算造肥，便买来一批猪贱价出卖给群众。高贯斗见到街上好些老婆闲着没事，便到本县推进社贷来一部分棉花，借给老婆们和纺织组；并规定头一次借的作本，以后纺了线再换棉花，这样越来越多。带起了六十多个老婆纺线。高贯斗经常去教给她们怎么纺细线、织好布，纺了线、织了布到推进组去卖。从三月到现在，六个月已织了廿七匹布，除七匹是给亲戚家白织的外，其余卖了三百七十斤米。她们说：“要不是高贯斗不断的指挥，俺也摸不着门，也做不了这么长工夫。那天纺线断了棉花，他就接济一下，有点难事随时给解决。”在该村影响下，附近南王庄、杨贡桥等村，也到高贯斗的推进组里换棉纺线。
    高贯斗的推进组，并注意扶植垮了台的合作社复业。如高兴周等组织的香油合作社，因为分工、计工不清，没有作到等价两利，有的只顾做自己活，吃油房的饭。有的卖很大力气也和别人一样分红，结果都消极起来。高贯斗便把推进组的经验介绍给他们。后来该社清理了一下旧帐，又具体分了工，并根据劳动力的大小确定了分红办法。这样谁也干的很上劲。该社并计划最近扩大资金。此外，该村织布合作社也几乎垮台，后经高贯斗帮助，才没垮台。全村五个合作社，在高贯斗领导下，业务都很活跃。
    此外，高贯斗还领导农民改造碱地。他见到李大起、孙海林等家的碱地成年不长庄稼，便经常到他们几家动员，启发他们改造碱地的兴趣。并动员碱地户到自己地里拉土，把碱性渗下去，下一场雨耕一次。现在孙海林等几家的十几亩老碱地长的庄稼很强。这样，也启发了别的户改造碱地。
