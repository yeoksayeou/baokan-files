　　Compensating Middle Peasants Wrongly Struggled Against:
　　What exactly is the purpose?
　　Comrade Editor:
　　I have several questions to ask for clarification.
　　1. One of the three generations employed a long-term farmhand. The family's living standard declined in 1933 (owning 1.1 mu of farmland and renting 1.5 mu, relying on weaving for a living), and there was no longer any exploitation. In 1944, the daughter-in-law inherited a piece of land from her maiden home, and the family's living standard rose. Now there are six people in the family, cultivating 5.8 mu of paddy field, 2.9 mu of river beach land, and 2 mu of dry hillside land, totaling 10.7 mu, which is cultivated through hired labor (the family has no labor force; there are three men, two of whom went out to participate in revolutionary work after the incident, leaving only a four-year-old boy at home, and three women, one 56 years old, one 32, and one 11). The family only does light work such as planting vegetables, weeding, and watering. What is their class status? Should they be considered a wealthy middle peasant, an ordinary middle peasant, or a poor peasant? Also, should the feudal remnants of exploiting long-term farmhands (1.1 mu of land) from the family's three generations be considered feudal roots and confiscated?
　　2. When determining class status based on three generations, they were initially classified as landlords and rich peasants but were changed to middle peasants during the rectification of policies. To protect the interests of the middle peasants, wrongly confiscated items should be returned. However, some items have already been borrowed by the poor peasant committee and the work team or distributed to the peasants, making it difficult to return them. Or the items distributed to the peasants have already been damaged. What should be done? Currently, most of the items are still stored in the warehouse and have not been distributed. Would it be acceptable to return 65% of the confiscated items and classify the remaining as feudal roots and not return them? Is giving these things to wrongly classified households to take care of their production, or to not infringe on the interests of the middle peasants? Can it be said that it is the "leniency" of the poor peasant leagues and the poor towards wrongly classified households, to carry out unity?
　　3. After the policy is rectified, the class status determined by the poor peasant committee and the land reform work team after discussion is not agreed to by the classified household. Is it correct to ask the district committee to approve the execution? If the wrongly classified household keeps raising opinions to the work team during the reclassification of class status, affecting the work, can they be suppressed? Is it considered a counterattack?
　　4. One household was classified as landlords when investigating three generations and was completely evicted. Now they have been reclassified as middle peasants. One member of the family has been working outside since the incident and returned home last winter for medical treatment due to illness. When the family was evicted, his personal belongings, medicines, bedding, clothes, shoes, socks, mosquito nets, pens, and books were all confiscated. Now they want to be returned, but some of them have been borrowed or distributed to the peasants and have been used up or damaged, making it difficult to return them. How should this be handled? Also, the Certificate of Glorious Sacrifice issued by the government after another man in the family died in battle was also confiscated and lost during the eviction last year. Now his family members are demanding its return. What should be done?
　　5. From when to when should things be returned to middle and poor peasants who were wrongly classified? What should be done if things are lost (such as due to rain) during the return period? Also, the wheat fields of the wrongly classified households that were confiscated this year were cultivated by the original owners, and the newly assigned households have harvested them and planted autumn crops. Should the wrongly classified middle peasants be returned the wheat? Also, the wrongly classified households have more good land and less bad land, but the total mu and output per capita are all below the average middle peasant level. Now that their good land has been confiscated, they do not want land from other families. After the class status is reclassified, should the land still be returned to them? Also, if the poor peasant league's accounts do not have a record of something being returned to a wrongly classified household, but the wrongly classified household says it exists and has proof from a person who participated in the confiscation that it was indeed taken, can it be returned? If there is proof that it was confiscated, but it cannot be found in the warehouse, what should be done?

　　Answer: The purpose of land reform is to eliminate feudal and semi-feudal exploitation, liberate the productive forces, and develop production, not other things. Therefore, all issues in land reform should start from this principle. Why should we consolidate and unite with the middle peasants? Because the middle peasants are laborers and producers. Protecting the middle peasants means protecting the productive forces. Infringing upon the middle peasants means destroying the productive forces. In the process of new democratic economic construction, from the individual economy to the collective cooperative economy, we mainly rely on the middle peasants. They have rich production experience and relatively complete production tools. We must consolidate and unite with all the middle peasants to make large-scale production successful. If we undermine the interests of the middle peasants, or even oppose them, then our slogan of "raising agricultural production by an inch" will fail, and even lead to the failure of the revolution. Compensating the wrongly struggled middle peasants is to achieve the goal of developing production. Consolidating and uniting with all the middle peasants is our strategic task. Therefore, it is wrong to say that compensating the middle peasants is the "leniency" of the poor peasant leagues towards the middle peasants. The middle peasants are our own people. If we mistakenly hurt the middle peasants, we must compensate them. If we do not compensate them, we cannot unite with the middle peasants well and achieve the goal of unity and production. (Regarding the issue of uniting the middle peasants, Comrade Ren Bishi has a brilliant explanation in his article "Several Issues in Land Reform." Please pay attention to and refer to it.)
　　Compensating the middle peasants should mobilize the poor and hired peasants and rely on them to actively discuss and resolve issues with the middle peasants in a consultative manner. On the one hand, the class status should be publicly revised, and on the other hand, compensation should be given based on the specific situation. If we do not analyze and rigidly adhere to returning the original items, this will cause unnecessary fluctuations in the countryside and affect rural unity and production. This is not the purpose of our rectification. In revising the class status, the person concerned should be involved. Anyone (regardless of class status) can raise opinions. If they disagree, they can appeal to the higher-level government for revision. Democracy should be fully promoted. The work team should not be afraid of others raising opinions. It is good to raise opinions, which can reduce mistakes. It should never be thought that someone raising questions or appeals is a counterattack and should be "suppressed." That is a manifestation of not implementing policies and lacking a democratic style, which should be corrected.
　　The specific issues raised in the letter can be easily resolved based on these principles:
　　1. The family's male labor force participates in the revolution, and the land is cultivated by hired labor, which cannot be considered exploitation. Their class status can be determined based on their relationship to the means of production. In the past, there was feudal exploitation, leaving 1.1 mu of land, which cannot be confiscated as feudal remnants. If landlords and rich peasants whose class status has been lowered still possess a large amount of feudal property, a portion of it can be confiscated.
　　2. Compensation should be based on the specific situation. If the items have not yet been distributed, the peasant masses should be persuaded to return the original items. If they have been distributed, all public and private efforts should be made to compensate them. We should not rigidly adhere to returning the original items.
　　3. The items of this cadre that were wrongly confiscated should be appropriately compensated. If the Certificate of Glorious Sacrifice of his family was also confiscated and lost, a request should be submitted to the higher-level government to reissue it.
　　4. If the good land of the middle peasants has been taken away, it can be appropriately adjusted to make up for the average middle peasant level.

### 补赏错斗中农究竟是为了什么？

　　补赏错斗中农
  　究竟是为了什么？编辑同志：
    我有几个问题请解答。
    一、三辈中有一辈雇过长工种地，民国二十二年生活下降（自耕地一亩一，租地一亩五分，靠织布为生活），没有剥削了。民国三十三年媳妇到娘家继承了一部土地财产，生活上升，现在六口人，种水地五亩八分，河滩地二亩九分，旱岭地二亩，共十亩七分靠代耕来种（家无劳力，男三人，两名事变后出去参加革命工作，家里只剩一个四岁的男孩子，女人三口，一五十六岁，一三十二岁，一十一岁），自家只作种菜锄草浇水等轻活。是什么成份呢？算富裕中农呢算普通中农呢？或是算贫雇。又这家三辈中剥削长工的封建遗物（地一亩一分）是否算封建根子，应不应没收？
    二、查三代定成地富，端正政策时改为中农，为了照顾中农利益，应退回错没收东西。但有一部分已经贫农委员和工作组讨论借出去，或分配给农民了，难以退回。或分给农民已经用坏，应怎么办呢？现在库里还存着大部东西未分，给他退还被没收的百分之六十五，其余归成封建根子不退，可以不可以？给错定户这东西，是为了照顾他生产呢，还是为不侵犯中农利益呢？可不可说成是贫农团和贫民对错定户的宽大？以便进行团结。
    三、端正政策，经贫农委员和土改工作组讨论评定的成份，被定户不同意，请区委批准执行对不对？错定户在改定成份时，老找工作组提意见，影响工作是否可以镇压一下？算反攻不算？
    四、有一户查三代时定成地主，全部扫地出门了。现在改定为中农，其家有一人自事变即出外参加革命工作，去冬因病回家治疗，没收时把他的私人用品、药品、被褥、衣服、鞋、袜、蚊帐、水笔、书籍，全没收了，现在要给他退，但农民已借用或分到的一部，已经用完或用坏，现在难以退回，应如何处理？又其家另一男人作战牺牲后，政府发给的光荣牺牲证，去年扫地时一并没收了，并已失落找不见了，现在他家属要求退还，应怎么办？
    五、退东西给错定成份的中农和贫农，是由什么时候开始退？到什么时候结束呢？若在退还期间东西损失了（如雨水等），应怎么办呢？又今年没收的错定户的麦田，是原主培植成的，新分配户已收割并种上秋田。是否还给错定的中农退麦子？又错定户好地多坏地少，但按人口平均总亩数和产量全在一般中农以下。今年没收他好地后，他也不要别人家的地，现成份改定后，土地是否还要退还他？又给错定户退东西，对于贫农团帐上没有的，错定户说有，并有参加没收时的经手人证明确实拿过，是否可以退还？如果确有证明曾经没收，但保管库里现在找不见了，又该怎办？

    答：土地改革目的是为了消灭封建与半封建剥削制度，解放生产力，发展生产，而非其他。因之土改中的一切问题，皆应从这个原则出发。为什么要巩固地团结中农？因为中农是劳动者，生产者，保护了中农，就是保护了生产力，侵犯了中农就是破坏了生产力，在新民主主义经济建设中，由个体经济到集体合作经济的发展过程中，主要是依靠中农，他们有丰富的生产经验，与比较完备的生产工具，必须巩固地团结全体中农，才能把大生产搞好，如果我们破坏了中农的利益，甚至与他们对立起来，那就要使我们“把农业生产提高一寸”的口号落空，甚至会使革命趋向失败。补偿错斗的中农，就是为了达到发展生产的目的。巩固的团结全体中农，是我们的战略任务。因之说补偿中农，是贫农团对中农的“宽大”是错误的。中农是自家人，误伤了中农，必须补偿，不补偿便不能很好团结中农，达到团结生产之目的。（关于团结中农问题，任弼时同志在“土地改革中的几个问题”一文中有精辟的解释，望注意参考）。
    补偿中农应发动贫雇农，并依靠他们主动地以协商方式和中农共同商量解决，一面公开地改订成份，一面根据具体情况，予以补偿。如果不加分析，拘泥退还原物，这样将在农村中引起不必要的波动，影响农村团结生产，这不是我们纠偏目的。在改定成份中应吸收本人参加，任何人（不管是什么成份）有意见都可提出，不同意时可向上级政府申诉改订，应该充分发扬民主，工作组不应怕别人提意见，有意见提出是好的，可以减少错误，绝不应认为有人提出疑问或申诉，就认为是反攻，而予以“镇压”，那是不执行政策，缺乏民主作风的表现，应该改正。
    来信中提出的几个具体问题，根据这些原则也就好解决了：
    一、家中男劳力参加革命，土地代耕，不能算做剥削，其成份可根据其对生产资料的占有关系来决定。过去曾有封建剥削，留下一亩一分地，不能当成封建遗物予以没收。地富成份下降的，如仍拥有大量封建财产，则可征收其一部。
    二、补偿应根据具体情况，如果实尚未分配，应说服农民群众退回原物，如已分配，则应尽一切公私力量给以补偿，不应拘泥退还原物。
    三、这个干部被错误没收的东西，应适当补偿，其家中的光荣牺牲又被没收遗失，应呈请上级政府补发。
    四、中农好地被抽，可适当调剂一下，补够一般中农水平。
