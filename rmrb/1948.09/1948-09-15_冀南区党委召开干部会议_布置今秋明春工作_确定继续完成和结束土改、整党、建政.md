Jinnan District Party Committee Holds Cadre Meeting
　　Deploys Work for This Autumn and Next Spring
    Determining to Continue to Complete and Conclude Land Reform, Party Consolidation, and Political Construction

　　[Jinnan Electric] The Jinnan District Party Committee convened a meeting of district and county cadres on August 13th to thoroughly study the Central Committee's 1948 instructions on land reform and party consolidation. Based on this spirit and the extent of land reform in the district, the meeting determined the future work direction and tasks, as well as specific steps for implementation. Taking advantage of the relatively idle season for farmers, from September this year to April next year, the work of completing or concluding land reform, party consolidation, and political construction will be carried out, combined with winter production, to prepare for the large-scale production movement next year. Based on investigations and reports from various district and county party committees, the land reform work in the entire district was assessed. Except for areas of the Second District (Gaotang, Pingyuan) and parts of the Third District near Anyang where there are still small groups of armed special agents active, the entire district is considered consolidated. Moreover, after struggles such as rent reduction, interest reduction, grain lending, debt redemption, wage increases for hired workers, and the liquidation of traitors, the feudal system has been basically eliminated, but not completely. It is estimated that in the entire district, only areas with a population of about two million still require large-scale supplementary adjustments. According to the standards stipulated in the Central Committee's 1948 instructions on land reform and party consolidation, Jinnan can be roughly divided into two categories of areas (first and second category areas), with third category areas only found in individual villages. The first category areas account for approximately 75 percent of Jinnan. This type of area has two situations: one is that the feudal system has been eliminated, and land has been generally divided equally, with similar average landholdings for each class; however, a small number of landlords and rich peasants still occupy more and better land and property. The other is that the feudal system has been eliminated, and the land obtained by each class is the same as in the first category areas, but the land and property left for landlords and rich peasants are less than the average for peasants, resulting in an "inverted pagoda" phenomenon. These areas are mostly places that underwent major reviews last year. The second category villages are those where land reform is not thorough. These villages account for approximately 25 percent of Jinnan. Third category areas are only individual villages in the Jinnan District. According to a survey in Nangong County, only one out of more than one hundred villages is in this category. In the entire district, wrongly targeted middle peasants account for approximately 20 to 50 percent of the households that were struggled against. The reasons for this are: first, there was no unified standard for class division; second, the boundaries for local despots and traitors were not clearly defined; third, the idea of absolute egalitarianism was supported. According to statistics from Qinghe: in the county's 323 villages, 3,928 households were struggled against, of which 1,672 were middle and poor peasants who were wrongly targeted, accounting for 44.1 percent of the total number of households struggled against (they have now been returned and compensated). The Party in Jinnan, judging from the leading cadres and the majority of party members and their completion of party tasks since the War of Resistance Against Japan, is basically pure. However, impure thinking and work style are common. According to a survey of 12 villages in Xiazhen: out of a total of 343 party members, 42 were involved in corruption and embezzlement, seizing excessive fruits of labor, 12 unreasonably beat the masses, 16 sheltered landlords and rich peasants, 5 did not work, and 3 raped women, while 243 were actively working and had no major errors. A survey of 40 villages in the Fourth District: out of a total of 769 party members, 20 had consistently sheltered landlords and rich peasants, embezzled for personal gain, committed murder, engaged in sectarianism, coerced the masses, or raped women, accounting for 2.53 percent of the total number of party members. 151 individually sheltered landlords and rich peasants, constantly beat and scolded the masses, or engaged in corruption, accounting for 19.09 percent of the total number of party members. 237 built air-raid shelters for themselves, engaged in petty corruption, or had an undemocratic work style, accounting for 30 percent of the total number of party members. 361 had no errors, accounting for 45.46 percent of the total number of party members. According to a survey of party member composition in seven villages in Gaotang: out of 64 party members, 35 were poor peasants and 29 were middle peasants. In Feixiang's First District, there were a total of 789 party members, including 2 landlords, 14 rich peasants, 281 middle peasants, and 492 poor peasants. A survey of 93 villages in Xiazhen: there were 971 party members, including 712 poor peasants, 254 middle peasants, 3 rich peasants, and 2 landlords. From the above statistics, it can be seen that impure class composition is not serious, but it also shows that impurity exists. In more than 40 villages in Feixiang, 19 branches, except for two relatively good branches, the rest must be disbanded (the reason why they must be disbanded is not clearly explained, and the wording that the rest must be disbanded is also ambiguous, possibly referring to a part of the 40 villages surveyed. – Editor). The branch of a certain village is run by a father and son, and they do not develop others. In a certain village, there are eight party members, including three fathers and sons, three sisters-in-law, who are controlled by special agents and detached from the masses. In a certain village, seven party members are all controlled by special agents. This shows that political impurity within the Party is also serious. In order to further strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses, and to make rural branches the core of leadership, it is necessary to conscientiously carry out party consolidation in accordance with the policy of education and transformation.

　　Based on the above situation, the future work direction and tasks are: to continue to complete and conclude land reform, party consolidation, and political construction. On this basis, prepare for all aspects of the large-scale production campaign next year, so as to provide the greatest support to the front lines and improve the people's lives. In late August, each unit will convene county and district cadre meetings to thoroughly discuss the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, autumn tax collection, manure accumulation, and wheat planting. Flood-stricken areas should focus on disaster relief through production. Around September 10th, land reform work in key land reform counties should come to an end. On September 15th, cadres will go to the villages. From the end of September to the beginning of October, the content of this phase of work should focus on production, specifically leading the masses in the autumn harvest and wheat planting, combined with doing a good job of social investigation, clarifying the land ownership situation in various types of villages and the situation within the Party. Combining production, correct the wrongly classified components of individual villages, and each district should focus on developing land ownership certificates for individual villages. In the first half or second half of October, each county will convene county and district cadre meetings again to thoroughly discuss land reform and party consolidation, and formulate a work plan to carry out land reform and party consolidation with a focus. Strive to conclude the supplementary adjustments before the lunar new year. After the lunar new year, continue party consolidation and political construction, and establish people's representative conferences at the county, district, and village levels. The work focus and methods for each type of village are: the work content of the first category of villages is: completing small-scale land adjustments, issuing land ownership certificates, correcting wrongly classified components, improving or enriching farmers' associations, compensating for losses of middle peasants, arranging for landlords and rich peasants, consolidating the party and building the government, re-determining burden standards, and other work. The work content of the second category of villages is: understanding the situation, conducting preliminary statistics, removing obstacles to land reform, classifying classes, organizing, mobilizing, or establishing poor peasant committees, making supplementary land adjustments, issuing land ownership certificates, preventing class enemies from participating in party consolidation, and by April next year, the entire district should transition to production. Farmers must pay attention to combining winter production with all preparations for the extensive large-scale production movement in the spring, during the spring plowing. In the large-scale production movement, farmers must prevent two deviations: one is being careless, only focusing on completing the task without regard for quality; the other is opposing doing things piecemeal, without a plan, and being slow. In the face of serious tasks and tight deadlines, call on leaders at all levels to be conscientious and responsible, unite their strength, train cadres well, unite Party activists and better elements, publicize policies, thoroughly understand the situation, make plans, and enlighten all the masses to take action and successfully complete the work tasks.

　　冀南区党委召开干部会议
  　布置今秋明春工作
    确定继续完成和结束土改、整党、建政
    【冀南电】冀南区党委于八月十三日，召开地、县干部会议，详细研究了中央一九四八年土改与整党指示。并根据此精神和本区土改程度，确定了今后工作方针与任务，以及具体执行的工作步骤。乘农民较闲季节，从今年九月始至明年四月，完成或结束土改整党、建政并结合冬季生产，作好明年开展大生产运动的一切准备工作。根据各地、县委的调查汇报，估计了全区土改工作。全区除二分区的高唐、平原，三分区接近安阳的部分地区，尚有小股武装特务活动外，均为巩固区。而且都是经过减租、减息，借粮斗争，赎地还债，雇工增资，反奸清算，土改等斗争，封建制度基本上已被消灭，但还没完全消灭。估计全区仅有二百万人口左右地区，还须作较大范围的抽补调剂。根据中央一九四八年关于土改与整党工作指示规定的标准，冀南大体可分两类地区（第一、二类地区），第三类地区只是个别村庄。第一类地区在冀南约占百分之七十五。此类地区有两种情况：一种是封建制度已经消灭，土地已大体平分，各阶层土地的平均数相差不多；尚有一小部分地主富农，占有较多较好的土地财产。另一种是封建制度已消灭，各阶层所得土地和一类区同，但留给地主富农的土地财产少于农民的平均数，有倒宝塔的现象。这种地区多是去年经过大复查的地方。第二类村是土改不彻底的。这类村在冀南约占百分之二十五。第三类地区，在冀南区仅是个别村庄。据南宫县调查，一百多个村中只有一个。全区误伤中农，约占被斗户的百分之廿到百分之五十。其原因：第一没有划阶级的统一标准；第二对恶霸汉奸的界线划分不明确；第三绝对平均主义的思想支持。据清河统计：全县三百二十三个村，被斗者三千九百二十八户，其中错斗的中、贫农占一千六百七十二户，占被斗户总数百分之四十四点一（现已退还补偿）。冀南的党从领导骨干，党员大多数，和自抗战来完成党的任务上来看，基本上是纯的。但思想作风不纯是普遍的。据夏津十二个村调查：共有党员三百四十三人，贪污腐化、多占果实的四十二人，无理捆打群众的十二人，包庇地主富农的十六人，不干工作的五人，强奸妇女的三人，工作积极和没有什么错误的二百四十三人。四分区四十个村的调查：共有党员七百六十九人，一贯包庇地主富农、贪污自肥、有杀人罪、闹宗派、强迫群众、强奸妇女的二十人，占党员总数的百分之二点五三。个别包庇地主富农、不断打骂群众、贪污腐化的一百五十一人，占党员总数百分之一九点零九。当防空洞、小贪污、作风不民主的二百三十七人，占党员总数百分之三十。没有错误的三百六十一人，占党员总数百分之四十五点四六。据高唐七个村的党员成份调查：六十四个党员中，贫农三十五人，中农二十九人。肥乡一区党员共七百八十九人，地主二人，富农十四人，中农二百八十一人，贫农四百九十二人。夏津九十三个村的调查：党员九百七十一人，贫农七百一十二人，中农二百五十四人，富农三人，地主二人。从以上统计来看，阶级成份不纯虽不严重，但也说明不纯是有的。肥乡四十多村，十九个支部，除两个支部较好外，其余都须解散（为什么须要解散未交代清，其余都要解散词句也含混，恐系指所调查的四十村的一部。——编者）。某村支部是父子，不发展别人。某村八个党员，父子三人，妯娌三人，被特务掌握，脱离群众。某村七个党员，都被特务掌握。这说明党内政治不纯也是严重的。为了更加密切党和群众的连系，使农村支部成为领导的核心，必须按照教育改造的方针，认真进行整党。
    根据以上情况，今后的工作方针与任务：继续完成和结束土改、整党、建政。在此基础上，作好明年开展大生产的一切准备工作。以尽最大的支援前线，改善人民生活。八月下旬，各单位召开县、区干部会，详细讨论秋收、秋耕、秋征、积肥、种麦。水灾区要以生产救灾为主。九月十号左右，土改重点县，土改工作要告一段落。九月十五号，干部到村。九月底到十月初、这一段的工作内容：要以生产为主，具体领导群众秋收、种麦，结合作好社会调查，弄清各种类型村土地占有情况及党内的情况。并结合生产，改正个别村的错订成份，每个区要有重点的发展个村的土地证。十月上半月或下半月，各县再召开县、区干部会，详细讨论土改、整党，并订出工作计划，有重点的开展土改、整党。要争取阴历年前结束抽补。阴历年后继续整党、建政，建立县、区、村三级人民代表会。各类型村的工作中心及作法上，第一类村的工作内容是：完成小范围的土地调剂，发土地证，改正错订成份，改进或充实农会，补偿中农损失，按置地主富农，整党建政，重订负担标准等工作，第二类村工作内容是：了解情况进行初步统计，扫除土改障碍，划阶级，组织、发动或建立起贫民委员会，抽补调剂土地，发土地证明，阻止阶级敌人来整党，至明年四月全区转入生产，农民在每年春天的耕作进行中，都必须注意结合冬季生产为春天的广泛大生产运动的一切准备工作。在大生产运动中农民要防止两种偏向：一是粗枝大叶，只管作完不管好坏的急性子；二是反对作到哪里算哪里，没有计划，不紧张的慢性病。在任务严重，时间紧迫的情况下，号召各级领导认真负责，团结力量，训练好干部，团结党内积极分子和较好分子，宣传政策，深入了解情况，做好计划，启发所有群众，行动起来，胜利完成工作任务。
