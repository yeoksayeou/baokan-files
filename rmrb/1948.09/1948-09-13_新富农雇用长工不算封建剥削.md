　　Employing Long-Term Laborers by New Rich Peasants Does Not Constitute Feudal Exploitation

To the Editors:
    Currently, our streets are covered with slogans promoting vigorous production and striving for wealth. We are also singing songs of vigorous production, calling on everyone to work hard and learn from the good examples of labor heroes in building up their families through labor. However, the masses say that some labor heroes, such as Wu Manyou, own a lot of land, raise cattle, sheep, and donkeys, and also employ long-term laborers. Does this constitute feudal exploitation? Here, households that have employed long-term laborers have been classified as landlords or rich peasants. Are these newly emerged labor heroes not feudal elements? Is the classification of class status not based on land ownership and exploitative relationships? Then, what else are these households if not feudal rich peasants? The masses asked me, and I was stumped. Please provide a quick reply to avoid the masses having misgivings and hesitating to engage in bold production.

    Answer: Those who have risen to become rich peasants through labor and production with the support of the policies of the democratic government are not feudal rich peasants. Their land and property ownership is not derived from feudal exploitation but mainly from building up their families through labor. They should be considered new-style rich peasants. Although they employ long-term laborers, this constitutes capitalist exploitation, not feudal exploitation. They should be treated the same as prosperous middle peasants. Why is the exploitation by new-style rich peasants capitalist rather than feudal? The difference lies in the fact that the long-term laborers employed by new rich peasants have fundamental differences in political status and economic treatment compared to the feudal exploitation by old rich peasants. The former's employees and employers are completely equal in political status. The contract is voluntarily entered into by both parties. Employees can participate in peasant associations and village political activities. Naturally, the feudal servitude and abuse and humiliation of personality by employers against employees are eliminated. Economically, although employees are still exploited for their surplus value by employers, their general wage and living standards are guaranteed to a certain extent under the conditions of the contract between the two parties, and the arbitrary illegal exploitation, deduction, and other extra-economic exploitation by employers against employees are abolished.
    The Party's policy is to allow the existence and development of new rich peasants. Comrade Ren Bishi clearly pointed out in "Several Questions on Land Reform": "The existence of such rich peasants is not harmful to us. Moreover, it will continue to develop in the future. In the past, we encouraged such rich peasants, such as Wu Manyou, to develop their production, which played a great role in confirming the status of middle peasants and stimulating their enthusiasm for production. Our policy in the future should still be like this." Even in our North China, there are such examples, such as the labor hero Li Shunda in Taihang and Shi Zhenming in Taiyue. They all became wealthy through labor and have employed both long-term and short-term laborers, constantly receiving commendations and rewards from the Communist Party and the democratic government. This has played a significant role in stabilizing the middle peasants and stimulating their enthusiasm for production. This policy was correct in the past and is still correct now and will continue to be implemented in the future. In the future, employing long-term laborers and freely buying and selling land will still be allowed. Everyone can rest assured and boldly engage in production to get rich, and the government will definitely protect them.

专栏：询问与答复

　　新富农雇用长工不算封建剥削编辑同志：
    现在我处各街都是写的开展大生产努力发家致富的标语，唱的也是大生产的歌子，都是号召大家努力生产，学习劳动英雄们劳动发家的好榜样，可是群众说，有些劳动英雄如吴满有等家里种着很多土地，喂着牛羊驴，并且还用着长工，这算不算封建剥削呢？在我们这里用过长工的户都按地主或富农清算了，这些新发的劳动英雄难道就不是封建吗？划分阶级不是按土地占有和剥削关系划分的吗？那么这些户不是封建富农是什么呢？群众问我，把我问住了，请快给以答复，以免群众心里有疙瘩不敢大胆生产。

    答：凡在民主政府政策的扶植下，而劳动生产上升为富农者，非封建富农，因其土地财产的占有，非由封建剥削所得，主要靠劳动起家，应是新式富农。虽然他们雇长工，但因其系资本主义式的剥削，而非封建剥削。对他们应和富裕中农同等看待。新式富农为什么是资本主义剥削而非封建剥削呢？其区别是新富农所雇佣的长工在政治地位和经济待遇上和旧富农的封建剥削都有基本的不同，前者雇工和雇主在政治上是完全平等的，契约是双方自愿订立的，雇工可以参加农会，可以参加村里的政治活动，自然更取消了雇主对雇工的封建性的奴役及人身人格上的虐待污辱等。在经济上，雇工虽还被雇主剥削其剩余价值，但一般工资生活待遇在双方契约条件下有一定保障，而废除了雇主对雇工的任意非法剥削克扣及其他超经济剥削。
    党的政策是允许新富农的存在和发展的。任弼时同志在“土地改革的几个问题”中明确指出：“这种富农的存在对我们并无害处。而且在将来一个时期内还会发展的。过去我们鼓励这种富农，例如吴满有那样的人们，发展其生产，对于确定中农，刺激中农的生产热情，起了很大作用，我们今后的政策，还是应当如此。”即在咱们华北，也有这种例子，比如太行的劳动英雄李顺达，太岳的石振明等，他们都是劳动致富，曾雇用长短工，不断受到共产党和民主政府的表扬奖励。这对稳定中农刺激中农的生产热情起了很大作用。这个政策，过去现在都是正确的，今后还要继续执行，今后也允许雇长工，自由买卖土地，大家放心大胆的努力生产去发财，政府绝对加以保护。
