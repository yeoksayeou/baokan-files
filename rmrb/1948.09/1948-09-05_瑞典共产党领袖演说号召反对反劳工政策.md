　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. TASS reports: Swedish Communist leader Lindroth, in a speech at a party organizational meeting in Stockholm on the 26th, stated that in Sweden only the Communist Party is a party fighting to realize socialism, while the Social Democratic Party has abandoned this fight. They do not mobilize the working class but cooperate with the bourgeoisie to jointly oppose the Communist Party. Lindroth then pointed out that the Swedish bourgeoisie is attempting to reduce workers' wages and lower people's purchasing power under the pretext of so-called restoring domestic economic balance. Lindroth called on the people to rise up and actively fight against this anti-labor policy.

　　瑞典共产党领袖演说号召反对反劳工政策
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社报导：瑞典共产党领袖林德鲁兹二十六日在斯德哥尔摩的党的组织会议上发表演说称，在瑞典只有共产党才是为实现社会主义而战斗的政党，而社会民主党却已放弃这个战斗。他们不去发动工人阶级，却去和资产阶级合作，共同反对共产党。林德鲁兹接着指出，瑞典资产阶级正在借口所谓恢复国内经济平衡，而企图消减工人工资及降低人民购买力。林德鲁兹号召人民起来为反对这个反劳工政策而积极斗争。
