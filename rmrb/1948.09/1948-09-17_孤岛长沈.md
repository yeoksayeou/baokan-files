　　Due to the Kuomintang army's stubborn resistance and frantic plunder, prices in the few isolated strongholds of Changchun and Shenyang have skyrocketed, causing immense suffering for the people, who are rising up in resistance.
    In Changchun, the price of sorghum per pound was 3.8 million yuan (puppet Northeast circulating currency, same below) on August 2nd, and had soared to 29.5 million yuan by August 18th. In those sixteen days, the price of one pound of sorghum increased by an average of 1,100 yuan per minute. At the same time, even tree bark was selling for 600,000 yuan per pound. In market transactions, currency notes with denominations below 5,000 yuan were weighed by the pound. One pound of 1,000-yuan notes was worth 250,000 yuan; it took 118 pounds of 1,000-yuan notes to buy one pound of sorghum. Another reason for the soaring grain prices in the city, according to the Peiping World Daily on August 16th, was the Kuomintang bank's excessive issuance of promissory notes, reaching 500 to 600 billion yuan per day. The Kuomintang army's plunder in the city has become all-pervasive. The most common practice is to break into people's homes to rob them, even stealing steamed bean noodles and tree bark cakes that citizens haven't finished cooking. Many citizens are forced to cook at night. According to a report in the Shenyang newspaper on August 10th, grain prices in Shenyang rose sharply in half a month: sorghum from 140,000 yuan to 240,000 yuan per pound, and corn from 130,000 yuan to 220,000 yuan. The Kuomintang army's grain robbery in Shenyang is roughly the same as in Changchun, but they can also rob in the suburban areas. In one village in Tieling, the Kuomintang army even killed piglets weighing only ten pounds when they arrived. The people begged, "The pig is too small! Please don't kill it!" The Kuomintang army replied, "It's still bigger than a chicken!"
    The populations of Changchun and Shenyang are decreasing rapidly. The Kuomintang army in Changchun is driving large numbers of citizens out of the city. Police arrest people on the streets every day, search their bodies for all their belongings, and then drive them out of the city. The Kuomintang authorities in the city also issued an order stating that only citizens with three months' worth of food reserves who register can live in the urban area; all others must be driven out. According to Zheng Zongyin, a worker representative who came to our liberated area from Changchun, when he left Changchun, the city authorities were investigating wealthy peasants and landlords who had fled into the city last year, preparing to plunder their grain and then drive them out. According to statistics released by the puppet municipal government of Shenyang, the population in July had fallen to 992,000, more than half the population at the time of the Japanese surrender. More than half of the citizens remaining in Shenyang are unemployed and starving. According to the Kuomintang city authorities, more than 620,000 of these nearly one million people are destitute, unemployed workers, and refugees.
    Under the brutal oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang army, the people's resistance is growing daily. All railway employees from Shenyang to Benxi (including the Benxi Coal Mine, totaling over 30,000 people) went on strike on July 27th. Trains on all lines were suspended, and work in engineering, machinery, and telecommunications was completely halted. They put forward five demands, including increased wages, distribution of grain, and timely payment of salaries. By early August, the Kuomintang authorities, under the workers' powerful pressure, were forced to concede, and the struggle came to an end. Workers in various departments of the Benxi Coal and Iron Company (including electrical, foundry, special steel, electric light factory, and large factories) began a strike on August 7th. Over 400 workers, armed with wooden sticks and iron picks, surrounded the company manager's office building, demanding food. They persisted until the next day, when the company agreed to the workers' wage increase demands, and the strike ended victoriously. All primary school teachers in Changchun went on strike for a month, finally forcing the municipal government to grant primary school teachers the same grain rations as municipal government employees. The poor are constantly staging grain riots. On the night of July 27th, seventy or eighty people broke through the enemy's "suppression team" guard and opened the warehouse in the backyard of the puppet Kantei Hall to carry away grain. On another occasion, when enemy grain trucks passed by, starving people swarmed forward and robbed all the grain. Recently, when enemy grain trucks drive through the area, hundreds of people often lie down on the road, preventing the trucks from passing and demanding the return of the grain stolen from the people. Although the Kuomintang authorities are doing their utmost to suppress these actions, mass riots continue to erupt.
    Workers, students, and the poor, unable to bear the Kuomintang's persecution and exploitation, are fleeing to the liberated areas in droves. Electric power workers Cui Fengyi, Wang Maocai, and over 180 members of their families recently escaped from the Kuomintang-controlled area. As soon as they arrived in the liberated area, they said, "This time, we've finally returned home!"

　　孤岛长沈
    由于国民党军的盘踞顽抗以及疯狂的掠夺，长春、沈阳等少数孤立据点物价狂涨，生活痛苦万分，人民纷纷起而反抗。
    长春市八月二日高粱米每斤为三百八十万元（伪东北流通券，下同）八月十八日已涨至二千九百五十万元。一斤高粱米在这十六天中平均每分钟涨价一千一百元。同时连树皮都卖到每斤六十万元。市面交易时，票面额在五千以下的流通券都是过秤以斤计算的。一千元的流通券每斤值二十五万，要一百一十八斤一千元的流通券才能买到一斤高粱米。该市粮价狂涨另一原因据八月十六日北平世界日报透露，系由于国民党银行滥发本票，每日达五、六千亿元。该市国民党军的掠夺已发展至无孔不入，最通常的是闯进民家去抢，连市民还没有蒸熟的豆面和树皮的饼子都抢走，许多市民被迫改在晚上煮饭。沈阳的粮价据八月十日该市报载：半月间高粱米从每斤十四万涨到二十四万，苞米从十三万涨到二十二万。该市国民党军的抢粮大致跟长春的相同，不过可以抢到城郊地区。如铁岭一个村，国民党军来时连十斤重的小猪都杀了，老百姓哀求说：“猪太小哩！不要杀吧！”国民党军回答：“总比鸡大吧！”
    长、沈两地人口均在急剧减少。长春市国民党军正把大量市民驱出市外。警察每天在街上抓人，搜尽身上财物后便逐到城外。该市国民党当局并曾下令宣布：除有三个月存粮的市民经登记可住在市区外，其余一律赶出市区。据自长市来我解放区之工人代表郑宗印谈，他离长时该市当局正调查去年逃进城去的富农地主，准备在搜刮他们的粮食后赶出城外。沈阳市据伪市府发表统计，七月份人口已降为九十九万二千余人，较日寇投降时减少一半以上。而所有这些留沈的市民半数以上都在失业和饥饿中。据国民党市当局供认，这近百万人中有六十二万多人是赤贫、失业工人和难民。
    在国民党军残暴压榨下，人民的反抗日益增长。沈阳至本溪的全体铁路员工（包括本溪煤矿共三万余人），于七月廿七日起怠工，各线车辆停驶，工务、机务、电务亦全部停顿。他们提出增资、发粮食及准时发薪等五项要求，至八月初国民党当局在工人强大威力下被迫让步，斗争始告一段落。本溪煤铁公司各部工人（包活电气、翻砂、特殊钢，电灯厂、大工厂等）于八月七日开始罢工，工人四百余手持木棍、铁镐等包围该公司经理办公的大楼，要求给饭吃，坚持到次日，公司答应工人增资要求，罢工乃胜利结束。长春市全体小学教员曾罢教达一个月，终于迫使市府答应小学教员与市府职员发给同等粮食的要求。贫民不断发生抢粮骚动。七月二十七日夜间，有七、八十人冲破敌“清剿队”警戒，打开伪康德会馆后院的仓库搬运粮食；另一次当敌军粮车经过马路时，饥民即一拥而上将粮抢光。近来该地敌军运粮汽车行驶时，常有数百群众横卧路上，阻止汽车通过，要求退回自老百姓手中抢来的粮食。国民党当局对此虽竭力镇压，但群众性的骚动，仍此伏彼起。
    工人、学生及贫民等不堪国民党迫害榨取纷纷逃来解放区。电力工人崔凤仪、王茂材等及其家属一百八十余名日前逃出国民党统治区，他们一到解放区就说：“这回才算回到了自己家里！”　　　　　　　　【新华社东北电】
