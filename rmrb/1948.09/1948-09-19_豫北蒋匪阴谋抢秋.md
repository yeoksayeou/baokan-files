(Taixing Telegram) Amidst our active preparations to organize a full-scale struggle to protect the autumn harvest, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the northern Henan border region are stepping up their preparations, attempting to begin their nefarious activities and plunder our autumn harvest. The enemy along the Daokou-Qinghua Railway in the Fourth Military Sub-district is repairing the Daokou-Qinghua Railway to Xiuwu city, planning to continue laying tracks to Daiwang before the autumn harvest; they are also building a highway to Wuliyuan, attempting to control our most grain-producing area. At the same time, the enemy has secretly planned the amount of "grain levies" and plundering in our border areas and some villages in adjacent core areas, and is preparing to send secret agents to investigate the situation, organize puppet village and town organizations, and prepare to plunder the autumn harvest after the enemy invades and establishes temporary strongholds. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Xinxiang, Anyang, Huixian, and Ye counties in the Fifth Military Sub-district are preparing to plunder the autumn harvest, adjusting and deploying their forces. The enemy in Huixian is holding meetings; the enemy at the Huaicun camp stronghold in the county has increased by one regular army battalion, and the troop strength in the city has also continued to increase. The enemy in Anyang has made the following preparations for plundering the autumn harvest: (1) Conducting intensive training for puppet organization personnel to arrange for the plundering, the main content of which is to rectify and investigate the number of villages, security units, land, and autumn seedlings, in order to plan and assign the task of grain plundering to various regions. They have now gone to the countryside to carry out the above work. (2) Mass conscription to replenish the main force and strengthen the garrison and mobile armed forces for plundering. From July 2nd to August 20th, in nearly fifty days, they have conscripted 427 young and middle-aged men from twenty-eight villages in our border areas. At the same time, the enemy also forced the conscription of more than 200 men from the armed forces of various puppet villages and towns to serve as the backbone of new recruits and is concentrating on training them in Anyang city. (3) Robbing and developing maintenance forces everywhere to expand the autumn plundering front. Since July, the enemy has successively carried out large and small-scale "mopping-up" operations and raids in our weak areas such as Dangzhonggang, Panjia'an, Gao Xiaotun, and Beiqugou, attempting to defeat our people's armed forces and border organizational institutions, threatening to maintain order, but they have all been repelled by us. At present, our border troops and civilians are actively preparing, and counties such as Hui and Ye have begun to launch attacks to protect the autumn harvest.

　　豫北蒋匪阴谋抢秋
    【太行电】在我积极准备组织全力保秋斗争声中，豫北边区蒋匪正加紧准备，企图开始蠢动，向我进行抢秋。四分区道清沿线之敌，正在修复道清铁路至修武城，计划在秋收前续向待王铺轨；又向五里源修公路，企图控制我产粮最多地带。同时敌人已在我边地及某些毗连之腹心地区村庄，暗地计划好“派粮”抢收数目，并准备派遣密探侦察情况，组织伪村镇机构，准备随敌进犯，打下临时据点后进行抢秋。五分区新乡、安阳、辉县、邺县等地蒋匪已在准备抢秋，调整配备兵力。辉县敌正在召开会议，现该县槐村营据点敌增加正规军一个营，城内兵力亦续有增加。安阳敌更作了如下抢秋准备：（一）集训伪组织人员布置抢收，主要内容是整顿与调查乡保和地亩秋苗数目，以计划分配各地区抢粮之任务，现已下乡开始进行上述工作。（二）大批抓兵，补充主力以加强守备与抢收机动武装。自七月二日开始，到八月二十日近五十余天中，已在我边沿区二十八个村庄，抓走青壮年四百二十七人。同时敌又强迫从各伪乡镇武装中，抽丁二百余，以作新兵骨干，正集中安阳城训练。（三）四出抢劫发展维持，扩大抢秋阵地。从七月以来，敌先后向我当中岗、潘家庵、高小屯、北曲沟等薄弱地区，进行大小“扫荡”与突击，企图打垮我人民武装与边地组织机构，威胁维持，均被我击退。现我边地军民正积极准备如辉、邺等县，已开始出击，进行保秋。
