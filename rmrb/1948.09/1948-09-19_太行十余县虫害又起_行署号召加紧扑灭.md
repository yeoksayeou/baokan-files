　　Taihang Insect Plague Returns to More Than Ten Counties
  　Administrative Office Calls for Intensified Efforts to Eradicate It
    [Taihang Electric] Since the beginning of autumn, more than ten counties in the Taihang First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Special Districts have experienced insect plagues, which are developing rapidly. Thousands of mu of rice paddies east of Xingtai City have been infested with old rice stem borers. Due to the lack of timely eradication, they have suffered serious losses. In Wu'an County of the Sixth Special District, and Lin County, Ye County, Zhangnan, Anyang, and other counties of the Fifth Special District, cutworms, locusts, and scarabs have been found to be severely damaging mung beans and millet. With the autumn harvest approaching, the Taihang Administrative Office issued an emergency instruction on August 30, requiring leaders at all levels to be seriously vigilant, immediately launch inspections, and overcome complacency. In areas where insect plagues have already occurred, regardless of their severity, once they are discovered, the masses must be organized to eradicate them with all their might. Complacency and inaction are not permitted, resulting in losses. It is also required that the occurrence, development, eradication process, and experiences of insect pests, as well as the degree of damage, affected area, types of pests, and their characteristics, be reported to the Administrative Office in a timely manner. On the same day, the Administrative Office issued a circular throughout the region, commending the Fifth Special District Agricultural and Forestry Team, the Lin County Cooperative Section, and the cadres of Dongtun Village for their active struggle against insect plagues. They had adopted new medicines and tools, actively organized the masses, and quickly eradicated scarabs that had spread across more than 700 mu of millet land.

　　太行十余县虫害又起
  　行署号召加紧扑灭
    【太行电】入秋以来，太行一、四、五、六专区十余县发生虫灾，发展甚速，邢台城东数千亩稻田发生稻缠旧虫，也因没有及时消灭，受到严重损失。六专区武安、五专区林县、邺县、漳南、安阳等县，也都发现黏虫、蝗洫（＠蝗）、明虼螂等虫为害绿豆谷子甚大。目前秋收已近，太行行署特于八月三十日发出灭虫紧急指示，要求各级领导干部严重警惕，立即发动检查，克服麻痹。在虫灾已发生地区，不论严重与否，已经发现，都必须组织群众全力扑灭。不许麻痹不管，造成损失。并要求将虫害发生发展扑灭经过及灭虫经验、为害程度、为害面积、害虫种类、特性等及时报告行署。同日，行署向全区发出通令，表扬对虫灾积极作斗争的五专农林组、林县合作科，及东屯村干部。因他们曾采用新的药剂与工具，积极组织群众，迅速扑灭了蔓延于七百余亩谷地的明虼螂虫。
