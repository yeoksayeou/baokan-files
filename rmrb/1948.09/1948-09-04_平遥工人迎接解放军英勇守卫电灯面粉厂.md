[Jinzhong News] "The factory is the life of us workers. We depend on motors and steel mills for our livelihood, and we cannot allow Yan's bandits to destroy it. Whoever tries to destroy it will be beaten back with iron bars!" This was the just and firm cry from the workers of the electric light factory and flour mill in Pingyao when our People's Liberation Army approached the city. On May 11th, the Yan bandits in the city, fearing annihilation by our forces, abandoned the city and fled at midnight. At this time, the workers were very happy. First, the day they had been waiting for day and night had arrived; second, the enemy did not have time to destroy the factory. However, there were still remnants of the enemy in the city. The workers closed the gates and held a meeting to discuss how to deal with the remaining enemies and protect the factory. Some of the workers were deceived by Yan's bandits' propaganda and were uneasy, fearing that our army would carry out "thirty-six killings" upon arrival. Yang Fuwei, an electrical worker, immediately exposed these absurd claims of Yan's bandits, and those few people felt relieved. Han Junde, the head of the engineering section who came from a working-class background, firmly stated, "The machines are ours, and we must protect them well. We will welcome the People's Liberation Army when they enter, and if a few enemies come to destroy our factory, we will beat them out with iron bars!" He repeated these encouraging words to those few fearful workers, saying, "I will open the door, I will make contact. If there are killings, kill me first." This further reassured them, and they continued to work on sending electricity as usual. At eight o'clock in the morning on the 12th, seven Yan puppet soldiers came, holding guns and calling at the door. The workers thought it was the People's Liberation Army. When they went out and saw that it was not the People's Liberation Army, Han Junde refused to let them into the factory. They demanded fifty bags of foreign flour. Han Junde gave them ten bags of flour and sent them away. At nine o'clock, more than a hundred suspicious people came, looking fierce, and insisted on entering the factory. All the workers immediately mobilized urgently, preparing to resist. Yang Fuwei said to the enemy, "This is a factory, our rice bowl. If you destroy it, how will we live? When the People's Liberation Army comes, how will we explain it? Who will take responsibility?" The workers said angrily in unison, "We rely on this factory to eat! When the Liberation Army comes, the factory will belong to the people. Whoever dares to make trouble will be beaten out!" Seeing that the situation was not good, these suspicious guys turned around and left. The workers were extremely anxious. Just then, the People's Liberation Army entered the city. Han Junde quickly went to the army to make contact and reported to County Chief Lu of the democratic government that the factory's machines were undamaged and that there were still 130,000 catties of white flour milled. The factory was still operating. County Chief Lu immediately praised their contribution to protecting the factory and proposed that everyone be reinstated at their original positions and salaries to work with peace of mind. Han Junde told everyone this, and they were overjoyed. They immediately proposed to help the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government quickly restore order in the city, providing electricity all night for three nights to ensure bright lights, so that the staff could work well. The electrical workers Lin Weizhi and Yan Dehua went to the democratic municipal government, the municipal committee, and the army organs and repaired more than two hundred light bulbs in a row, and helped the telephone bureau set up the wires. The reporter visited the Pingyao Power Plant and the steel mill and saw that all the factory equipment was intact. The flour mill workers and electric light workers were all working actively.

　　平遥工人迎接解放军英勇守卫电灯面粉厂
    【晋中讯】“工厂是我们工人的生命，我们凭着电机、钢磨生活，不能让阎匪破坏。谁要破坏，用铁棍把他打回去！”这是我人民解放军兵临平遥城下时，该城电灯厂、面粉厂工人发出的正义、坚强的呼声。五月十一日，该城阎匪畏惧被我歼灭，在当夜十二时弃城逃跑了。这时工人们很高兴，一是日夜盼望的解放的日子到来了；二是敌人来不及破坏工厂了。但是城内还有残敌，工人们关住门，开起怎样对付残敌保护工厂的会议。工人中有几个受了阎匪的欺骗宣传，害怕我军来了实行“三十六杀”，心中不安。电气工人杨福尉立刻把阎匪这些胡说揭穿，那几个人心也安了。工人出身的工务科长韩俊德，坚决表示说：“机器是咱们的，咱们要好好保护它，人民解放军进来咱就欢迎，少数敌人来破坏咱们工厂，就用铁棍把他打出去！”他又对那几个害怕的工人重复的说壮胆话：“我开门，我接头，杀的话先杀我。”更使他们心情安定下来，照常做起送电工作。十二日早晨八点，果然来了七个阎伪军，持着枪叫门，工人只当是人民解放军来了，出门一看，不是解放军，韩俊德就不准他们进厂，他们要五十袋洋面，韩俊德给了十袋面，把他们支应走了。九点钟，又有一百多不三不四的人，气凶凶的来了，非进工厂不可，全体工人，立即紧急动员起来，准备抵抗，杨福尉对敌人说：“我们这是工厂，是我们的饭碗，你们破坏了，我们怎样活呢？人民解放军来了，怎样交代，谁负责任呢？”工人们愤恨的同声说道：“我们凭这工厂吃饭的！解放军过来，工厂就是人民的，谁敢来捣乱，就把谁打出去！”这群不三不四的家伙，见势不妙，扭头走了。工人们心焦极了，正在这时，人民解放军进城了，韩俊德连忙去找军队接洽，又找到民主政府的卢县长报告工厂机器毫无破坏，还有磨下的十三万斤白面，工厂还开着工。卢县长当即表扬了他们保护工厂的功劳，提出原职原薪叫大家安心工作，韩俊德把这话回来对大家一讲，大家欢喜若狂，马上提出来帮助解放军民主政府迅速恢复城市秩序，长夜送电三夜，保障电灯明亮，使工作人员很好工作，各机关毁坏的电灯泡立即修起来，电气工人林尉之阎德华到民主市政府市委会部队机关一连换修了二百多个灯泡，并帮助电话局架设好电线。记者参观了平遥发电厂和钢磨，见全部工厂用具完整无损，面粉工人和电灯工人们，都在积极的工作着。（郑东）
