　　(Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th) TASS reports: The Third Congress of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, which began on the 6th of this month in Prague, successfully concluded on the 10th after passing three major resolutions. The first resolution passed by the congress concerned the issue of protecting human rights, which pointed out that fascism is being revived in certain countries, forming a serious threat to human rights and peace. The U.S. imperialist bloc has launched an offensive against the civil rights of American citizens and progressive political parties, and certain imperialist countries are implementing policies towards colonial and semi-colonial peoples that violate international law and the United Nations Charter. The resolution requested that the future declaration of human rights should be supplemented by an international convention guaranteeing human rights and declared that guaranteeing human rights is an urgent issue. The second resolution of the congress concerned the issue of opposing propaganda for a new war, which pointed out that acts of openly propagating and encouraging a new war are being carried out in the United States, Turkey, and Spain through radio, film, and newspapers. However, the people of the world reject this clamor. Therefore, the resolution stipulates that any form of directly or indirectly inciting war is a criminal act, and the dissemination of news inciting national hatred should be prohibited. The third resolution of the congress concerned the issue of punishing war criminals and collaborators. The resolution denounced the American and British occupying authorities in Germany for violating international agreements by refusing to extradite war criminals and instead defending Nazi war criminals. The resolution announced that the congress has established a standing committee to study the issue of war criminals.

　　国际民主律师大会闭幕
  　通过保障人权决议
    议决任何战争鼓动行为均属有罪
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社讯：本月六日起在布拉格举行的国际民主律师协会第三届大会，已于十日在通过三大决议后胜利闭幕。大会通过的第一项决议为保障人权问题，其中指出：法西斯主义正在某些国家复活，形成对人权与和平的严重威胁。美帝国主义集团发动了对美国公民权利与进步政党的攻势，某些帝国主义国家正对殖民地与半殖民地人民实行着违背国际法与联合国宪章的政策。决议要求未来的人权宣言应补充以保障人权的国际公约并宣布保障人权为迫切的问题。大会第二项决议为反对新战争宣传问题，其中指出，公开宣传与鼓励新战争的行为正在美国、土耳其、西班牙三国以广播、电影与报纸进行中。但全世界人民均弃绝这种叫嚣。因此决议规定：任何形式的直接或间接的鼓动战争，均属犯罪行为，并应禁止散布挑拨民族仇恨的消息。大会第三项决议为惩办战犯及通敌分子问题。决议指斥德境美英占领当局违反国际协定，拒绝引渡战犯并转而替纳粹战犯辩护。决议宣布大会已设立一常务委员会以研讨战犯问题。
