　　The fundamental characteristic of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and one of the important conditions for its victorious development is the democracy within its troops under centralized leadership. This kind of democracy in the army is carried out under conditions of strict order. It does not abolish or weaken the discipline necessary for the army. On the contrary, it consolidates and strengthens discipline. It merely makes this discipline based on the interests of the people and the common interests and consciousness of the officers and soldiers, and becomes the discipline commonly observed by all personnel of the army. As early as 1928, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed: "Not only do the workers and peasants need democracy in China, but the army needs it even more urgently. The thorough implementation of democracy in the army will be an important policy to destroy the feudal mercenary army in China. Because the life of soldiers in the feudal mercenary army is simply unbearable." At that time, in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army personally led by Comrade Mao Zedong, soldiers' committees were established, and officers were forbidden from beating soldiers, officers and soldiers wore and ate the same, enjoyed equal treatment, soldiers had freedom of assembly and speech, abolished cumbersome etiquette, economic affairs were thoroughly open, meals were managed by soldiers, and soldiers' representatives reviewed the final accounts. At that time, although there were only five cents of food money per day (rice was supplied by the local area), life was still good, and all personnel could share the leftovers (about sixty or seventy coins per person per day) for pocket money. After these measures were implemented, the soldiers were very satisfied, especially the new soldiers who had been captured from the Kuomintang army and joined the Red Army, who felt that the life in the Kuomintang army yesterday was obviously a different world from the life in the Red Army today. Therefore, the same soldier, who yesterday fought for the landlords, bureaucrats, and bourgeoisie, was still timid and did not move forward, but today, fighting for the workers and peasants, was twice as brave. This proves that democracy in the army has become one of the sources of the invincible strength of the Chinese People's Army.

　　In the past year, after the People's Liberation Army implemented the "three check-ups" and "speaking bitterness" new-style rectification movements in various units, the democratic life of the troops has had many new creations. In the army, this democracy is divided into three aspects: political democracy, military democracy, and economic democracy. The main points are as follows:

　　1. Political Democracy: Before the new-style rectification, many troops had already carried out democratic evaluations of merits and demerits quite universally, followed by evaluations of casualties and technical creations. After the new-style rectification, democratic criticism was further developed in the troops, mainly evaluating party members and cadres.

　　Evaluating party members includes opening up party branches, inviting non-party soldiers to give opinions on party members and branches, participating in the review and recommendation of new party members, and participating in the review of the conversion of probationary party members, etc.

　　Evaluating cadres includes using democratic methods to inspect leadership, suggesting the selection and promotion of cadres, suggesting the removal of incompetent cadres, and democratically evaluating merits and demerits and discipline at war evaluation meetings, etc.

　　This democratic movement is actually a broad movement of criticism and self-criticism in the army, and mainly the criticism of officers by soldiers, the criticism of party members by non-party masses, and the public self-criticism of cadres and party members among the masses. In this process of criticism, the firepower of criticism often focuses on the shortcomings of the criticized. Therefore, in the later stage of the democratic movement, that is, after the criticism, some focused on evaluating merits, and some held unity meetings, so that the results of the criticism achieved the purpose of strengthening unity and consolidating leadership.

　　2. In terms of military democracy: it is developed from the democratic evaluation of merits and demerits in the meritorious service movement to the evaluation of casualties (related to the idea of loving soldiers on the battlefield), and then to the evaluation of technology. From this, it has developed into the currently universally implemented war evaluation. In addition, there is also the "brainstorming meeting" (some call it the "Zhuge Liang meeting") before the war, to concentrate the wisdom of the masses and inspire morale, overcome difficulties on the battlefield, and defeat the enemy. Some troops also hold meetings to discuss how to complete the task after accepting the task before the battle, and absorb correct opinions from the masses during the battle to correct shortcomings.

　　In addition, in the method of evaluating battles after the war, some troops in East China and North China recently adopted the sand table method, arranging the actual situation of the war in the sand table, and conducting democratic inspection and evaluation according to the command and actions taken by each person during the battle, which can determine merits and demerits and study experiences and lessons. Doing so closely combines the actual situation of training and war.

　　3. In terms of economic democracy: the main thing is to combat corruption and waste, the meals are managed by soldiers, and the accounts are published regularly. The company has an economic committee organization (those who have established soldiers' committees are subordinate to the soldiers' committee), and one economic member is elected for each platoon, and one economic representative (or economic officer) is elected for each squad.

　　According to reports from various places, after the troops have earnestly and correctly implemented the above three aspects of democracy, they have shown a new atmosphere, and it is the most practical education for all kinds of personnel in the troops. Experience proves that as long as the democratic movement in the army is under correct leadership, for the purpose of improving and strengthening leadership and discipline, rather than for the purpose of undermining leadership and discipline, it can achieve great results. Here are three aspects to explain.

　　1. After the implementation of political democracy, the troops have made the following progress:

　　After the evaluation of party members, the prestige of the party has been improved, and many people have asked to join the party, all taking it as an honor to be a communist party member. In a certain company in Northeast China, twenty-three non-party members requested to join the party at the party evaluation meeting, and some even voluntarily paid party fees in advance. In various troops, there are many who voluntarily write applications to join the party and propose to be tested on the battlefield, and ask the party to posthumously recognize them as communist party members if they sacrifice on the battlefield. When liberated soldiers first come to our army, they often have a wrong understanding of our party. After the evaluation of the party, based on their own experience, and in contrast to the situation in the Kuomintang army, they realize that the Communist Party is truly upright and wholeheartedly serves the people. Some who had participated in the Kuomintang were moved, confessed, and declared their withdrawal from the Kuomintang. A liberated soldier in a certain unit in North China reflected, "When I first came, I thought that party members were supervising us, but now I understand that the Communist Party is completely different from the Kuomintang." Some said, "Because I suffered from Kuomintang members over there (in the Kuomintang army), after coming here, I was scared all day when I saw there were also party members. Now I know that the Communist Party is much stricter with party members than with the masses!" An Guo-cai, a liberated soldier from a certain regiment, praised when he saw the list of party members published, "The Communist Party is really great. Over there (referring to the Kuomintang), party members are only announced at the theater for half-price tickets." Liu Zhong, a liberated soldier from a certain regiment, said, "I've been in the army for more than a year and haven't become a party member yet. I will work hard in the future and strive to join the Communist Party." Some party members worried that the work would not be easy after the branch was opened up. Facts proved that it was just the opposite, because the party evaluation work was done well, not only educating the party members, but also educating the masses, and the masses trusted the party even more. The Kuomintang maintains the secrecy of its organization in the army and in society, and adopts secret surveillance methods against the masses. Our Communist Party should never and does not need to adopt this method, because this method is seriously divorced from the masses and causes suspicion and fear among the masses. It is completely wrong for some people to want to learn this bad style of the Kuomintang.

　　In addition, after the evaluation of cadres, the soldiers generally reflected: "The cadres have made progress, and we must also make progress. The opinions have been put forward, and our hearts are bright, and we are more motivated to work." Some cadres initially worried that letting soldiers evaluate cadres would lose their prestige. Facts have proved that as long as cadres take the initiative to lead this criticism, humbly listen to the correct criticisms of the masses, and make self-criticisms, and seriously improve their work and leadership style, their prestige will be enhanced, and the soldiers will love the cadres even more. After the democratic inspection of leadership in a certain unit in East China, the soldiers saw the cadres working with everyone and said, "Actually, you don't need to participate. Just give us more ideas and help us educate us well." Some cadres worried that it would be difficult to lead the soldiers in this way. However, as long as democracy is under centralized leadership, not leaderless and disordered extreme democracy, such results will not occur. In a certain unit of the Northwest Liberation Army, the soldiers' representative at the cadre evaluation meeting said: "Don't think that cadres will not be easy to be in the future, and don't dare to boldly lead us. We are an organized and disciplined army. After the problem is liberated, we should still handle things impartially." A certain unit in North China carried out a democratic movement in the Linfen campaign. After that, the cadres generally reflected, "It's strange. There were often problems in fighting in the past, but this battle was more cruel, and everyone automatically completed the task. The troops are easier to lead."

　　After the implementation of political democracy in the army, cadres, soldiers, and liberated soldiers all believe that it has a great educational effect on them, and their sense of responsibility and enthusiasm have been greatly improved. In the later period of the democratic movement in a certain unit in Central Plains, many battalion and company cadres said: "It's really dangerous! I didn't know how many mistakes I had made before!" Brigade and regimental cadres said: "Our bureaucracy is really killing people. We don't know how many serious phenomena are coming!" Zheng Xichun, the instructor of a certain unit in Northwest China, said after the soldiers' democratic evaluation, "I was responsible for not completing the task last time. This time, I want to be in front with the soldiers. Even if I am the only one left, I will complete the task." Xing Zeru, who was demoted from platoon leader to soldier, also made his own plan to correct his mistakes. Yang Jihui, who was demoted from squad leader to soldier, said: "We must resolutely complete the task and dedicate it to Chairman Mao. If it is street fighting, I guarantee to be the first to go to the roof." There are many similar examples. After the correct democratic movement, soldiers generally show that they are more eager to make progress, more obedient to orders, more brave in combat, and more consciously abide by discipline. The reason is that their political consciousness has been improved, the shortcomings of cadres have been corrected, and discipline has become their own discipline.

　　After the democratic movement, the progress of liberated soldiers is even more significant. They feel that the implementation of democracy in the army is something they have never seen before. A liberated soldier in a certain unit in North China said: "The Kuomintang is afraid of democracy. When soldiers see officers, if they don't agree, they are beaten with sticks and dealt with by military law. Offer opinions? Evaluate cadres? That's a dream! This time, evaluating cadres and evaluating party members is the first time I've ever seen it." Based on their own experience and comparison, they have increased their hatred for the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism. Some liberated soldiers in the Northwest troops tore up Kuomintang hats, hat badges, American-made supplies, and hidden armbands in public. They demanded not to be treated as prisoners of war and not to be called liberated soldiers. Some voluntarily exposed many hidden Kuomintang officers, spies, dissidents, and violators of discipline. The implementation of the democratic movement has enabled them to have a deeper understanding of the People's Liberation Army. Jiao Wendao, a liberated soldier in a certain unit in North China, reflected: "When I first came, I heard that we were going to fight Shijiazhuang. I thought, isn't this a head-on collision? A few days later, I heard that Shijiazhuang had been captured. I thought, Shijiazhuang's fortifications are strong and there are many soldiers, how could it be liberated so quickly? I figured it out a few days ago. The best weapon of the Eighth Route Army is troop democracy, unity between officers and soldiers, and everyone coming up with ideas to fight. Why can't we win?" They have already experienced that "in the Kuomintang, you can't be a squad leader even if you are a soldier for two years. Here, as long as you do a good job, everyone will elect you." In some troops, after the democratic movement, liberated soldiers no longer look at the issue from the distinction between prisoners of war or new soldiers and old soldiers, but from a class perspective.

　　2. After the implementation of military democracy, there are also many examples of the progress of the troops. As far back as the Panlong battle in Northwest China, a certain unit attacked a stronghold, but failed to capture it after two days of attack. Later, by adopting the suggestions of lower-level cadres and soldiers and changing the method of attack, they captured the stronghold in one fell swoop. In the Shijiazhuang battle, the capture of the Yunpan Mountain position was also due to the promotion of military democracy. From the start of the attack to the occupation, it took only ten minutes, with more than ten casualties, creating a model for siege warfare. More recently, in the Weixian siege battle in East China, the 5th Company of the 73rd Regiment adopted the opinions of the 2nd Squad when attacking the East City and quickly completed the task of blasting the city wall.

　　The implementation of military democracy is not only very beneficial in combat and training, but also has a great educational effect on cadres. For example, Xu Shengtang, the company commander of a certain unit in Central Plains, only knew that he wanted the soldiers to charge in the past, but never considered how to charge. Recently, during the democratic inspection of command and leadership, he was initially unable to accept the criticisms of the soldiers and was very distressed. Later, he repeatedly considered the "fourteen opinions on improving combat command" given to him by the soldiers, and after the actual experience of the Xuchang battle, he realized that each soldier has his own certain talents and began to change his command method. Later, in the battle to capture Luoyang, his company was assigned the task of the first assault company. The soldiers more actively discussed their opinions with him, and the entire company worked together to successfully complete the arduous task of breaking through Luoyang. This made him realize that implementing military democracy makes soldiers easier to command. Another example is a regimental commander of a certain unit in North China who initially did not believe in the masses. After the Linfen battle, he actually experienced that military democracy helped him, so he himself became an active supporter of military democracy.

　　3. After the implementation of economic democracy, due to the improvement of meals, the elimination of corruption and waste, the surrender of seized goods to the public, and the reasonable distribution of spoils of war, the mood of the soldiers immediately underwent a new change. For example, in a certain company in East China, sometimes there was not enough rice cooked, but the soldiers had no objections and did not want to cook a second time. The spoils of war seized by a certain unit can be distributed according to merit and need, promoting class friendship and giving more care to new soldiers and newly liberated soldiers. The soldiers said with satisfaction: "If this is the case, there will be no objections. Why commit discipline?" Therefore, the development of economic democracy has also helped maintain discipline in the army.

　　However, democracy must be organized and led. Extreme democratization without organization and leadership is wrong. The democratic movement and the establishment of democratic life in the army must be carried out in an organized, orderly, and led manner. Democracy in the army is to improve the relationship between officers and soldiers, the relationship between the military and the people, and improve the combat effectiveness of the army. It is to improve and strengthen leadership and discipline in the army, not for democracy for the sake of democracy, let alone to weaken the legitimate power of army officers to command operations, manage troops, and solve problems. Some troops did not clarify this point at the beginning, so some tendencies of extreme democratization and tailism of abandoning leadership occurred in some troops in a very short period of time, so they could not obtain the due effect of the democratic movement and slackened the unity of the troops. However, these tendencies were quickly corrected under the instructions of the higher authorities and were not allowed to develop. When carrying out democratic movements and establishing democratic life in the army, all troops must prevent and correct these tendencies at any time. But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Do not be afraid to let go and lead the masses and implement necessary democracy that is harmless and beneficial within a certain range because these deviations may occur. We must recognize the great achievements of democracy in the army, dare to implement democracy, so as to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, improve leadership, promote achievements, overcome shortcomings, and achieve greater unity and greater improvement in combat effectiveness of the troops. This is a manifestation of being more responsible to the party and the people's cause. (Xinhua News Agency, 4th)

### 军队中的民主运动

　　军队中的民主运动
    中国人民解放军的基本特点及其胜利发展的重要条件之一，是在它的部队中有集中领导之下的民主。这种部队中的民主，是在具有严格秩序的情况下进行的，它并不废除或削弱军队中所必需有的纪律，相反，它还巩固并加强纪律，它不过使这种纪律建立在人民利益和部队官兵群众共同利益与自觉的基础之上，而成为部队一切人员共同遵守的纪律而已。远在一九二八年，毛泽东同志就曾这样指示：“中国不但工农群众需要民权主义，军队需要更切。彻底的民权主义之施行于军队，将是破坏中国封建的雇佣军队之重要政策。因为封建的雇佣军队中的士兵生活，简直不是人能忍受的”。在当时为毛泽东同志所亲自率领的工农红军中，就建立了士兵委员会，并实行了官长不打士兵，官兵穿吃一样，待遇平等，士兵有开会言论之自由，废除繁缛礼节，经济彻底公开，伙食由士兵管理，士兵代表审查决算等。当时虽每日只有五分的伙食钱（米归地方供给），但生活仍过的不错，全体人员且能分得伙食尾子（每人每日约分得六七十文）以资零用。这些办法施行之后，士兵非常满意，尤其当时从国民党军队俘掳过来又加入红军的新兵，感觉昨日在国民党军队中的生活与今日在红军中的生活，是显然的两个世界。因此，同一士兵，昨日替地主官僚资产阶级打仗，尚畏缩不前，今日替工农群众打仗，便勇敢加倍。这证明军队中的民主成为中国人民军队不可战胜的力量的源泉之一。
    在过去一年中，人民解放军各部队实行了“三查”“诉苦”等项新式整军运动以后，部队的民主生活又有了不少新的创造。在部队中把这种民主分为政治民主、军事民主、经济民主三个方面，其要点如下：
    一、政治民主：在新式整军之前，许多部队已相当普遍地进行了民主的评功评过，接着又有评伤亡、评技术的创造，经过新式整军后，民主批评在部队中更进一步展开，主要地是评党员和评干部。
    评党员包括公开党的支部，邀请非党战士对党员和支部提意见，参加审查和推荐新党员，参加审查候补党员的转党等等。
    评干部包括采用民主方法检查领导，建议选拔干部，建议撤销不称积的干部，以及在战评会上民主的评功过，评纪律等等。
    这种民主运动，实际上就是军队中一种广泛的批评与自我批评运动，而且主要的是士兵对于长官、非党群众对于党员的批评，及干部和党员在群众中公开的自我批评。在这种批评过程中，批评的火力往往偏重于被批评者的缺点方面，因之，在民主运动的后一阶段，即在批评之后，有的就着重评功，有的开了团结大会，使批评的结果达到了加强团结，巩固领导的目的。
    二、在军事民主方面：是由立功运动中的民主评功过，进而评伤亡（与战场爱兵思想的关联），再进而评技术，由此发展为目前普遍实行的战评。另外还有战前的“想办法会”（有的叫“诸葛亮会”），以集中群众智慧，并激励士气，在战场上克服困难，战胜敌人。有些部队并在战前接受任务后，即开会讨论如何完成任务的办法，在战斗进行中又吸收群众中正确的意见改正缺点。
    此外，在战后实行评战的方法上，最近华东和华北有些部队，采用沙盘法，将战争实际情况在沙盘中布置出来，按照战斗进行中每人所采取的指挥、动作等，进行民主检查、评论，既可确定功过，又可研究经验教训。而这样做的本身，也就将练兵和战争的实际情况密切结合起来了。
    三、在经济民主方面：主要地是反贪污浪费，伙食由战士参加管理，帐目定期公布。连有经济委员会的组织（已建立士兵委员会者隶属士兵委员会），每排选一经济委员，另外每班选一经济代表（或叫经济员）。
    据各地反映，部队在切实而正确地实行了上述三方面民主之后，均呈现出新气象，并且是对部队各种人员的最实际的教育。从经验中证明：部队民主运动，只要是在正确领导之下，为着改善与加强领导和纪律，而不是为着破坏领导和纪律，就能收到很大的成效。这里仍分三个方面来说。
    一、在实行了政治民主之后，部队就获得了以下的进步：
    在经过了评党员以后，党的威信提高了，许多人要求入党，均以作一个共产党员为光荣。东北某连在评党会上，即有二十三个非党人员要求入党，并有预先自动缴纳党费者。各部队有很多自动写入党请求书者，并提出在战场上考验自己，要求如果在战场上牺牲了，也希望党追认其为共产党员。解放战士初到我们部队时，对我党常有错误认识，经过评党之后，他们根据自己的切身经验，与在国民党军队时的情况对照之下，认识到共产党真是光明正大，诚心诚意为人民服务的。有曾参加过国民党者，因受感动，便坦白了，并声明退出国民党。华北某部一个解放战士反省说，“我初来时，认为党员是监督我们的，现在明白了共产党和国民党完全不一样”。有的说，“因为在国民党那边受过国民党员的害，到这边后，看见也有党员，就整天心里害怕，现在知道共产党对党员比对群众严多啦！”某团解放战士安国材，见到公布党员名单，称赞说，“共产党真伟大呀，那边（指国民党）党员只是到了戏院才公布党员半票”。某团解放战士刘中说，“参加部队一年多啦，还不是党员，以后要好好干，争取参加共产党。”有些党员顾虑支部公开后，工作不好作，事实证明恰恰相反，因为评党工作做得好的，不惟教育了党员，而且也教育了群众，群众是更加信任党了。国民党在部队中，在社会上，保持组织的秘密，对群众采取秘密监视的特务办法，我们共产党决不应该也完全不需要采用这种办法，因为这种办法是严重地脱离群众的，是引起群众的怀疑和畏惧的。有些人想学习国民党这种恶劣作风是完全错误的。
    此外，在经过了评干部以后，战士们一般的反映说：“干部进步了，咱也得进步。意见提出来了，心里也就亮了，干工作也有劲。”有些干部最初顾虑，让战士评干部，恐将丧失自己的威信。事实证明，只要干部主动地领导这种批评，虚心听取群众的正确批评，并作了自我批评，认真改进自己的工作和领导作风，威信会更加提高，战士对干部也更加爱戴。华东某部民主检查领导后，战士看到干部和大家一起劳动，就说，“其实用不着你们参加，只要你们多出主意，好好帮助教育我们就行了”。有些干部顾虑，这样兵不好带。但是只要民主是在集中领导之下，不是无领导无秩序的极端民主，就不会发生这样的结果，西北解放军某部，评干会上战士代表说：“不要以为今后干部不好当，不敢大胆领导我们，我们是有组织有纪律的军队，问题解放了，还是应当公事公办。”华北某部在临汾战役中开展了民主运动之后，干部普遍反映说，“也怪，过去打仗常有毛病，这次的仗打得更残酷，都自动完成任务。部队更好带了。”
    政治民主在部队实施后，不论干部、战士以及解放战士，都认为对他们的教育作用很大，责任心、积极性都大为提高。中原某部在民主运动的后期，不少的营连干部说：“真危险！以前不知犯了多少错误！”旅团干部说：“我们官僚主义真害死人，多少严重现象都不知道来！”西北某部指导员郑锡纯，经过战士民主评论后，在攻运城时说，“上次没有完成任务，我应负责，这次我要在前面和战士一起，剩下我一个人，也要完成任务。”由排长撤职当战士的邢泽如，也订出自己改正错误的计划。由班长撤职当战士的杨继辉说：“要坚决完成任务献给毛主席，如果巷战，我保证第一个上房。”类此的例子很多。战士经过正确的民主运动后，一般是表现更迫切要求进步，更服从命令，更勇敢作战，更自觉地遵守纪律，原因是政治觉悟提高了，干部缺点改正了，纪律也成为他们自己的纪律。
    解放战士经过民主运动后，进步更加显著。他们感觉部队实行民主，是他们过去所从没有见过的事。华北某部解放战士说：“国民党怕民主，兵见了官，一不对头，就是棒子，军法从事。提意见？评干部？那是做梦！这回评干部，评党员，是我生平以来第一次见过。”他们根据自己切身经验对比的结果，更增加了对国民党反动派和美帝国主义的仇恨。西北部队的解放战士，有的将国民党的帽子、帽花、美制的用品、暗藏的臂章等，当众撕毁。他们要求不要把他们当俘虏看待，也不要叫他们解放战士。有的自动揭露了许多隐藏的国民党军官、奸细、异己分子、违犯纪律的分子。民主运动的实行，使他们对人民解放军有了更进一步的认识。华北某部解放战士焦文道反省说：“我初来就听说要打石门，心里想，这不是明碰钉子？不几天，听说石门打下了，心里还想，石门工事强，兵也不少，怎么就解放得这样快呢？前些日子想通了，八路军最好的武器就是部队民主，官兵一致，大伙出主意打仗，为什么不胜利呢？”他们已经体验到，“在国民党那边，当两年兵也当不了班长，这里只要好好干，大家就会选上你。”在若干部队中，解放战士经过民主运动后，已不再从俘虏兵或新兵与老兵的区别上去看问题，而从阶级观点去看问题了。
    二、在实行军事民主之后，部队的进步也有很多范例。远如西北蟠龙战斗，某一部队进攻一个据点，连攻两日不下，后因采纳了下级干部和战士的建议，改变方式攻击，结果一鼓攻克该据点。又如石门战斗中，云盘山阵地的攻占，也因发扬军事民主，从攻击开始到占领，仅只十分钟，伤亡十余人，造成攻坚战的范例。近如华东潍县攻坚战斗中，七十三团五连攻东城时，采纳了二班意见，而迅速完成了爆破城墙的任务。
    军事民主的实行，不但在作战上，练兵上好处很多，对干部的教育作用也很大。例如中原某部连长许盛堂，过去作战时，只知要战士冲，却从不考虑要怎样冲。最近在民主检查指挥和领导时，开始，他对战士的批评不能接受，很苦恼，后来他将战士给他提的“改进战斗指挥的十四条意见”反复考虑，又经过许昌战斗的实际体验，他才懂得每个战士都有他一定的才能，开始转变他的指挥方法。以后攻克洛阳的战斗，他这一连担任突击第一连的任务，战士们更加积极同他商量意见，全连同心努力，胜利地完成了突破洛阳的艰巨任务。这使他体验到，实行军事民主，战士更好指挥。又如华北部队某团长，开始对群众不相信，经过临汾战斗，实际体验到军事民主对他有帮助，于是他自己也成为军事民主的积极拥护者。
    三、在经济民主实行以后，由于伙食的改善，贪污浪费的消除，缴获归公及胜利品的合理分配，战士的情绪立即起了新的变化。例如华东某连，有时饭煮的不够吃，但战士们也没有意见，不要再作二次饭。某部缴获的胜利品，能按功劳与需要，发扬阶级友爱，对新战士和新解放战士多加照顾。战士们满意地说：“象这样就没有意见了，犯纪律干啥呢？”因此，经济民主的开展，也帮助了部队纪律的保持。
    可是，民主必须是有组织和有领导的。没有组织没有领导的极端民主化，是错误的。在部队中进行民主运动和建立民主生活，更必须是有组织，有秩序，有领导地去进行。部队中的民主，是为了改善官兵关系、军民关系并提高部队的战斗力，是为改善与加强领导和部队中的纪律，而不是为民主而民主，更不是要削弱部队长官指挥作战，管理部队，解决问题的正当的权力。有些部队开始没有弄清这一点，因而在某些部队中在极短的时间内发生一些极端民主化的偏向，及放弃领导的尾巴主义偏向，因而就不能获得民主运动所应有的效果，并松懈了部队的团结。但是，这些偏向在上级指示之下都很快地得到了纠正，没有让其发展，各部队在进行民主运动建立部队民主生活时，必须防止和随时纠正这些偏向。但不可因噎废食。不可因为可能发生这些偏向，便不敢放手领导群众，实行必要的在一定范围内有益无害的民主，要认识部队民主的伟大成绩，敢于实行民主，以便虚心听取群众意见，改善领导，发扬成绩，克服缺点，达到部队的更加团结和战力的更加提高。这就是对党对人民事业的更加负责的一种表现。（新华社四日电）
