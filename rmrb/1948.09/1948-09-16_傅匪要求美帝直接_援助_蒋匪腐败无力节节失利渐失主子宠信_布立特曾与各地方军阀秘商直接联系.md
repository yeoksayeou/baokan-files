Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. According to a Shanghai dispatch in the New York Star on August 6th, Fu Zuoyi requested the American Bullitt to ensure that the American aid military supplies for Fu's troops be directly transported to Tianjin, which was controlled by Fu Zuoyi, without passing through Shanghai, which was controlled by Chiang Kai-shek. Considering the corruption and ineffectiveness of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, and their repeated defeats, the American imperialists sent Bullitt to China in April this year to visit various places in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin. His secret mission, in addition to studying technical issues related to the use of 400 million US dollars, was to negotiate with various local warlords to establish direct armed aid relationships. Fu Zuoyi was one of the targets with whom Bullitt negotiated to receive direct American military supplies.

　　傅匪要求美帝直接“援助”
    蒋匪腐败无力节节失利渐失主子宠信
    布立特曾与各地方军阀秘商直接联系
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据纽约星报八月六日沪讯，傅作义曾要求美国布立特促使将供给傅部之美援军火，直接运往傅作义所控制的天津，而不经过蒋介石所控制的上海。按美帝国主义者鉴于蒋介石匪军腐败无力，节节失利，今年四月曾派布立特来华，遍访京、沪、平、津各地，其秘密任务，除研究有关使用四亿美元的技术问题外，便是与各地方军阀商洽建立直接武装援助关系；傅作义即为布立特商定直接以美国军火供给对象之一。
