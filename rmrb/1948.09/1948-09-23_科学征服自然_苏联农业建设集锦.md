　　Science Conquers Nature
  　A Collection of Soviet Agricultural Achievements
    ★ Cotton harvesting is underway in the Soviet cotton-producing regions. Soviet cotton leads the world in both quality and yield. Soviet scientists have not only cultivated varieties with long fibers but also varieties with fluffy fibers, and most notably, varieties with natural colors, with about twenty shades.
    ★ Researchers at the Plant Physiology Institute named after the great biologist Timiryazev have developed several chemicals to increase plant yields. Spraying a powdered medicine on tomato blossoms can increase the harvest by four to five times. Spraying a powdered medicine on fruit tree blossoms can prevent premature fruit drop and make the fruit grow exceptionally large. These powdered medicines have been used extensively on thousands of hectares of collective farms this year.
    ★ Winter wheat and naked barley are being sown for the first time this year in the frigid Siberian steppe region, which was previously considered unsuitable for growing these winter crops. However, scientist Lysenko carefully studied the conditions there and concluded that the inability to cultivate them was due to the accumulation of large amounts of ice shards in the soil after autumn plowing, which damaged the plant's system, along with dry winds. Therefore, he suggested sowing seeds on unplowed land after the autumn harvest to prevent the crops from being harmed by underground ice shards and leaving the stubble of the autumn harvest crops to protect against the wind.
    ★ Thanks to the painstaking cultivation of Soviet breeders, valuable fruit trees that were originally only suitable for planting in the south have been successfully planted in Leningrad. Fifteen varieties of cherry trees have been planted there, and the size and color of the cherries are no less than those in the south, with some varieties tasting even better than those in the south.
    ★ The All-Union Tea Industry and Subtropical Plant Science Research Institute in Georgia-Anasuri has created valuable new varieties of tea, lemons, and geraniums. The new lemons weigh nearly four taels each, are juicy and fragrant, and contain 2% more citric acid than other varieties. The new geraniums produce twice as much oil as other varieties.

　　科学征服自然
  　苏联农业建设集锦
    ★苏联产棉区正在进行收割。苏联棉花不论在质量与产量方面皆在全世界占领导地位。苏联科学家不但培植了具有长纤维的品种，还培植了具有柔毛纤维的品种，而最特出的则是具有天然颜色的品种，其色度约有二十种。
    ★以大生物学家季米里亚捷夫命名的植物生理研究所的研究人员，已研究出数种增加植物产量的化学品，当番茄开花时洒上一种药粉，就能使收获增加四倍至五倍，在果树开花时，洒上一种药粉，就能防止果子过早掉落而长得特别大。这些药粉今年已在数千公顷的集体农场上大量使用。
    ★冬麦与裸麦今年第一次在苦寒的西伯利亚草原地区播种，那里在过去是认为不能种植这些冬季作物的，但科学家李森柯仔细研究了那里的情况，认为不能耕种是因为秋耕后土地中积存大量冰屑伤害了植物的机体，同时并有干燥的大风，因此建议，秋收后在未加耕种的土地上下种，使作物不致受到地下冰屑的伤害，并留下秋收作物的残梗借以防风。
    ★由于苏联选种家苦心培养的结果，使本来仅适宜种植于南方的贵重果木，已成功地种植于列宁格勒，已有十五种樱桃树在该地种植，樱桃的大小和颜色并不低于南方，若干品种的味道胜于南方。
    ★乔治亚安那苏里的全苏茶叶工业与亚热带植物科学研究所，已创造了茶、柠檬、天竺葵的宝贵新品种，新种柠檬每个重量几近四两，多汁而芳香，比其他品种多含柠檬酸百分之二。新种天竺葵产的油较其他品种多一倍。（新华社）
