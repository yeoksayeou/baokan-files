Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: TASS Budapest, August 28th: Professor Pham Huy Thong, the Vietnamese delegate attending the International Teachers' Conference, stated: We fought against the Japanese aggressors, and now we are defending our freedom from French colonialists. Our war against French imperialism is progressing victoriously, and our troops are on the offensive everywhere. Although the French army is well-equipped, they can only move along flat roads and can therefore only capture cities. We are able to maintain freedom in most of the land. Pham also said that the Republic of Vietnam has also done a lot in promoting culture and is now implementing two years of compulsory education.

    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社布达佩斯八月二十八日讯：出席国际教师大会的越南代表范辉尚（译音）教授发表谈话称：我们曾与日本侵略者作战，现在我们又在保卫我们的自由不受法国殖民者侵害。我们对法帝国主义的作战正在胜利地进行，我们的军队到处都在采取攻势。尽管法军装备优良，但他们只能沿平坦的大路运动，因此只能攻取城市。我们则能在大部分土地上维护自由。范氏又称：越南共和国在促进文化方面，也作了很多事情，现正实施两年的义务教育。
