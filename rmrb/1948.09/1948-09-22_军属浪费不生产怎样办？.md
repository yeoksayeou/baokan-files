To the Editor:
　　Hu Feng, a military dependent in Daxinwang, Sixth District, Neiqiu, has a family of four (father-in-law, mother-in-law, and husband). Her husband has joined the army, and she wants to separate from her in-laws. After the separation, the masses are tilling her land for her, and she doesn't cultivate the five or six fen of garden land she was given. The weeds in the field are more than a foot high. This year, she harvested two shi and eight dou of wheat, and also wants to recover four dou of wheat in borrowed debt, totaling three shi and two dou of wheat (large dou). She eats well all day long and doesn't work, wandering around the streets. She wears a silver bracelet and good clothes, and goes wherever there is a gathering. She spends money freely, throwing away Mao banknotes. There are often three or five women who dress up and separate from the masses, constantly visiting her (she says they are her friends), eating, drinking, laughing, and not doing any work. Her in-laws don't dare to say anything, and when the village cadres speak to her, she not only doesn't listen but also argues and curses. The masses can't stand it at all, and the village cadres don't want to provoke her because she is a military dependent. For military dependents like this, can the grain harvested by the masses who till the land for her be given to her in installments instead of all at once, giving her a little less first (and saving the rest for her), to stop her from wasting it and make her work? What can be done?

Answer: The military dependent woman in Daxinwang Village, your county, who is not engaged in production and is corrupt and wasteful, can be persuaded to participate in labor through persuasion and education. If education is ineffective, the women's association can lead discussions on specific measures, and everyone can criticize and educate her to correct her shortcomings. It is also permissible for everyone to believe that the grain tilled for her should not be given to her all at once in order to limit her waste. However, she should be allowed to participate in the discussion in order to achieve the effect of education.

专栏：询问与答复

　　军属浪费不生产怎样办？编辑同志：
    内邱六区大辛旺有一军属胡凤，家人四口（公、婆、男人），男人参军了，她要与公婆分开家，分家后她的地群众给代耕着，给她丢了五、六分园地她也不养种，地里的草长够尺余高，今年她收二石八斗麦子又要回四斗麦子的外借帐共麦子三石二斗（大斗），她整天吃好的不做活在街串，手上带着银镯子穿着好衣服，那里集会到那里，毛票子一把一把哩花钱顺手流，经常有三、五个妇女束装脱离群众，你来了我走了不断她的门子（据她说是她的朋友），整天好吃好喝说说笑笑不做一会活。公婆不敢提，村干部一说不但不听，还要拉着骂。群众一点也看不惯，村干部觉得她是军属也不愿惹她。象这样的军属，群众给她代耕地收的粮食是否可以不一下给了她，先少给她点（其余给她存着），制止她浪费使她劳动。可怎样办请答复。　　　　　　　　　　
  　内邱县府合作科　郑汉杰
    答：你县大辛旺村军属妇女，不事生产、腐化浪费，可用说服教育方式，劝她参加劳动，如教育无效，可由妇会领导讨论具体办法，大家批评教育她纠正毛病。大家认为给她代耕粮食不一下给她，以限制她的浪费也是可以的。但应让她参加讨论，以收教育之效。
