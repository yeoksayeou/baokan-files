　　US-Canadian Supplied Chiang Kai-shek Bombers
    Indiscriminately Bomb Shijiazhuang Again
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 20th] The bombers supplied by the United States and Canadian governments to Chiang Kai-shek, from the 13th to the 17th of this month, again carried out continuous indiscriminate bombing of peaceful residents inside and outside Shijiazhuang. A total of 54 enemy planes came to bomb over five days, dropping more than 360 bombs. More than one hundred civilians were injured or killed, mostly women and children. Some civilian houses were destroyed, including the residences of Mr. Elsworth, representative of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund North China Working Team, and Mr. Hescott, president of the Friends Service Unit. A bomb struck the Christian Gospel Church. During the bombing, order in the city was good, and all the protection teams quickly dispatched to rescue and extinguish fires. The residents are extremely resentful of the Kuomintang bandits' bestial acts of bombing Chinese peaceful city residents with the backing of American and Canadian imperialism. Mayor Ke told reporters: "This kind of bombing by the Kuomintang bandits will not help their failures on the front lines, but it is a great education for our people in the rear. We must always remember this hatred and punish all the murderers who committed this crime."
