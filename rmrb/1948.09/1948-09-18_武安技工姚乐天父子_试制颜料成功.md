[Taihang Telegram] Yao Letian, a technician from Wu'an County's Bate Town, and his son Yao Peijiang, who are in the wool weaving business, are both skilled workers. To overcome the difficulty of purchasing pigments, they meticulously researched and are now able to use local materials to produce six kinds of pigments: sea blue, wool blue, vat blue, powder blue, cyan, and silver-gray. Every two taels of sea blue and powder blue can dye one zhang of cloth, and the other four kinds can dye one zhang and five chi of cloth per two taels. After dyeing and washing once with clean water, the color never fades after drying, almost the same as foreign products. They say that red, yellow, cyan, and green can all be manufactured in the future. In addition, soil indigo can be used to make indigo powder or indigo paste, which can replace foreign fast indigo. Recently, with the help of the Tenth District United Cooperative and the Bate Town Cooperative, they raised 8 million yuan in shares to open a wool weaving factory. After seeing the news in the newspaper encouraging innovation, their enthusiasm is even higher. They are now actively purchasing indigo seedlings to prepare for trial production of fast indigo.

　　武安技工姚乐天父子
  　试制颜料成功
    【太行电】武安县八特镇姚乐天和他儿子姚培疆，以毛织为业，都是技术工人。为克服购买颜料的困难，自己精心研究，现已能用本地原料制成海蓝、毛蓝、缸蓝、粉蓝、青色、银灰等六种颜料。海蓝、粉蓝每两能染布一丈，其他四种每两都能染一丈五尺。染后用清水洗一遍，干后永不退色，与外来品差不多。据谈：红、黄、青、绿将来都可制造。另外还可用土靛制成靛粉或靛糊，能顶外来快靛。最近在十区区联社和八特镇合作社帮助下，集股八百万元，开设了毛织工厂一座。他看见报纸上鼓励创造的消息后，情绪更高，现正积极购买靛苗，准备试制快靛。
