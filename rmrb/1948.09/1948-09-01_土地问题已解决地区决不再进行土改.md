　　Editor Comrade:
　　Currently, a rumor is spreading in the countryside that there will be a "second major leveling in September." Under this rumor, the farmers' enthusiasm for production has begun to waver, and eating, drinking, and gambling are gradually developing again. I went to Nan Quyu (under the jurisdiction of the Fifth District of Xingtang) to visit relatives, and the masses there were also saying the same thing: another leveling is coming soon. Some also said: The first major leveling targeted landlords and rich peasants; this time (the second time) it might target middle peasants. Some middle peasants are very uneasy, and the trend of eating, drinking, and wasting is rising again. Just at a small market in that village on the tenth, three or four meat sellers and several steamed bun sellers sold out before noon. Middle peasant Li Sanni (who used to work very hard) also rushed to the market to sell her mule, fearing that this leveling would level her mule as well.
　　I believe that if the rumors continue to spread, it will greatly damage the future work of the masses in working diligently and assiduously to actively produce and lay the foundation for next year's production. Therefore, I hope that the editor comrade will quickly reply to reassure the people and facilitate the masses' active production.

　　Answer: The fourth item of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instruction on "Land Reform and Party Consolidation Work in 1948" clearly points out: "In areas where the feudal system has been fundamentally eliminated, and poor and landless peasants have obtained land roughly equivalent to the average amount, and the difference between their land and that of middle peasants is small (which is permissible), it should be considered that the land issue has been resolved, and the issue of land reform should no longer be raised. The central task in these areas is to restore and develop production, complete the work of party consolidation and construction, and support the front lines." In most of the areas within the North China Liberated Area, the feudal and semi-feudal systems have been completely eliminated, and landless and land-poor peasants have received their due share of land. In these areas, the basic direction of rural work should shift from land reform to uniting people of all strata to fully restore and develop production. Since Xingtang has already undergone leveling and the number of land occupied by all strata is roughly average, it should be considered that the land issue has been resolved according to the central instructions. The main task in the future should be to unite people of all strata and make great efforts to restore and develop agricultural production, striving to improve agricultural production from its current level so as to better support the war and improve people's lives. Now is the time to seize the opportunity to accumulate fertilizer and compost manure to prepare for planting wheat and lay the foundation for next year's major production. The government should quickly determine land ownership, issue land certificates, formulate new agricultural tax regulations and burden standards, and help farmers solve production difficulties. The counties in the North Yue District have already done or will do so. Even if a few villages still have some land to be distributed or adjusted, or the class composition needs to be revised, it is not to carry out another leveling. The saying that there will be a leveling after autumn is baseless. The so-called second leveling to target middle peasants is even more unfounded. Our Party's policy of solidly uniting the middle peasants has been repeatedly stated in numerous instructions and has been resolutely implemented in actual work. All past deviations that infringed upon the interests of middle peasants must be corrected, and many have already been corrected. We should go deep among the masses to explain and publicize our Party's land reform and production policies, as well as the central tasks of the North China Liberated Area, and formally announce to the masses that land reform has been completed and that land will generally not be changed in the future. All strata should dispel concerns and concentrate on production. Pay attention to and analyze the nature and source of various rumors at any time and refute them. The leading organs should carefully check whether the deviations in land reform have been corrected and whether there are still infringements on the interests of middle peasants. Because concrete facts are the most convincing and the most sufficient to stabilize the people's emotions and clear obstacles to production. The situation reflected in the letter is extremely important, and we hope to continue to provide various concrete materials in the future in order to improve and promote work in various places.　——Editor

### 土地问题已解决地区决不再进行土改

专栏：询问与答复

　　土地问题已解决地区决不再进行土改编者同志：
    目前乡间正流传着一种“九月份再来第二次大平分”的说法。在这种流言下，农民生产情绪开始动荡，吃喝赌博又渐发展。我到南瞿营（行唐五区管）看亲去，那里群众也是这样说：又快搞平分呀。还有的说：第一次大平分搞完了地主富农，这次（第二次）可能搞中农。吓的一些中农很不安，吃喝浪费风气又起，只在初十该村一个小集上，三、四个卖肉的、几个卖馍馍的不等上午就卖光了。中农李三妮（过去干活很强）也赶紧上集去卖骡子，怕这次平分再平分了他的骡子。
    我看谣言流传下去，对今后群众勤劳刻苦，积极生产，为明年生产打基础的工作将受到很大损失。故望编辑同志迅速答复，以安民心，以利群众积极生产。

    答：中共中央关于“一九四八年土地改革和整党工作”指示中第四项明确指出：“凡属封建制度已经根本消灭，贫雇农已经得到大体上相当于平均数的土地，他们与中农所有土地虽有差别（这种差别是许可的），但是相差不多者，即应认为土地问题已经解决，不要再提土地改革问题。在这类地区的中心任务，是恢复和发展生产，完成整党建设工作及支援前线的工作。”华北解放区内部大部地区，封建与半封建制度已经彻底消灭，无地少地农民已分得应有的一份土地，在这些地区，农村工作的基本方向，应该从土地改革转到团结各阶层人民全力恢复和发展生产方面去。行唐既然已经经过平分，各阶层占有土地数目已大体平均，即应根据中央指示，认为土地问题已经解决，今后主要任务应是团结各阶层人民，以极大努力恢复与发展农业生产，争取农业生产能从现有的水平上提高一寸，以便更好地支援战争改善人民生活。目前正应抓紧时间，积肥沤粪，准备种麦，为明年的大生产打下基础。政府方面应赶快确定地权，颁发土地证，制定新的农业税则和负担标准，并帮助农民解决生产困难。北岳区各县已经或即将这样作。即有少数乡村有些土地尚待分配或调剂，阶级成份尚待改订，但也不是再来一次平分。秋后平分的说法，是毫无根据的。所谓第二次平分要搞中农，更是无中生有。我党巩固地团结中农的政策在屡次指示文件中已再三申明，在实际工作中也已坚决执行。过去所有侵犯中农利益的偏向，必须纠正，而且已纠正了不少。我们应该深入群众解释宣传我党土改和生产政策及目前华北解放区的中心任务，正式向群众宣布土改已经完成，今后土地一般不再变动，各阶层应打消顾虑，安心生产。随时注意并分析各种谣言的性质来源，予以批驳。领导机关要认真检查一下，看看土改中的偏向是否已经纠正，是否仍有侵犯中农的事情。因为具体事实是最有说服力，最足以安定群众情绪，扫清生产障碍的。来信所反映情况极为重要，以后望能不断供给各种具体材料，以便改进并推动各地工作。　——编者
