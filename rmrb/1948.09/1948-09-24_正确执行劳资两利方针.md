　　Correctly Implement the Policy of Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit

    Today's news broadcast by this agency regarding labor-capital relations in Harbin reflects that while the correct policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital" is being universally promoted in various liberated areas, achieving remarkable results in production and construction campaigns, there are still some private industrialists and business owners who distort government policies, arbitrarily infringe upon the legitimate rights of workers and apprentices, and violate the interests of the People's Government. This situation has also been found in other liberated areas and deserves attention.

    "Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit" is the basic principle of the New Democratic People's Government in handling labor-capital relations. The so-called "mutual benefit" means that, in order to achieve the goals of "developing production and promoting economic prosperity," the interests of both labor and capital must be taken into account simultaneously, and the interests of either party cannot be considered at the expense of the other. In the past, many places mistakenly overemphasized the temporary interests of the workers, neglecting the interests of capital, causing capital to be unprofitable, and even mistakenly applying the methods of anti-feudal struggle in rural areas to ordinary capitalists. The indirect or direct results of these erroneous actions not only harmed ordinary capitalists but also more seriously harmed the workers themselves. This "leftist" deviation has been or is being corrected in various places recently, and as long as it continues to exist, it must continue to be corrected. However, equally important is the need to oppose and prevent another deviation, namely, one-sidedly emphasizing the interests of capital, condoning illegal and undisciplined behavior by capital, infringing upon the legal rights of workers without interference, and even sacrificing the basic interests of the workers. This also violates the basic principle of labor-capital mutual benefit.

    The liberated New Democratic government, in the past, present, and even for a long period after the national victory of the revolution, while resolutely implementing the policy of eliminating bureaucratic capitalism, allows the existence of general capitalist economy and protects all private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy. But it must be pointed out that the capitalist industry and commerce allowed and protected by the New Democratic government are only those that benefit the national economy, only their legitimate business operations. If there are elements that undermine the national economy or behaviors that violate laws and regulations, they are naturally not allowed or protected, but should be prohibited and subject to appropriate legal sanctions. Acknowledging that the free bourgeoisie occupies a certain position in the economic and political organization of the New Democracy does not mean abolishing or relaxing the economic leadership of state-owned enterprises and the political leadership of the proletariat, or inappropriately raising the status of capitalists above workers and peasants, oppressing workers and peasants. Protecting the legitimate interests of industrialists and business owners does not mean that we should therefore unconditionally assist their operations that are detrimental to the national economy, or that we can ignore ensuring the various rights that workers should enjoy.

    Therefore, in dealing with labor-capital relations, party and government leading organs at all levels must correctly implement the policy of "labor-capital mutual benefit," and oppose both "leftist" and rightist deviations. We must both protect the interests of the workers and appropriately take care of the interests of capital; we must both appropriately protect the free bourgeoisie economically and politically; but when they have erroneous behaviors that violate the interests of the people and their government, we must also carry out appropriate struggles to ensure that the politics and economy of the country and society develop smoothly in the right direction that benefits the entire people. Wherever there are "leftist" errors, workers should be persuaded to take care of their long-term interests and correct this error; where capitalists violate policies and laws, the capitalists should be persuaded or ordered to abide by policies and laws. For the few who disobey persuasion, knowingly commit violations, or feign compliance, the government and relevant departments should impose effective sanctions according to the severity of the circumstances and in accordance with the law. However, at the same time, it is also necessary to pay attention to preventing the repetition of "leftist" errors, and not to adopt a policy of attacking and undermining the legitimate business operations of all small and medium-sized capitalists that are beneficial to the national economy, instead of adopting a policy of resolute protection. All relevant leading organs should pay attention to preventing the occurrence of any of the above-mentioned deviations at all times and in all places, and ensure the correct implementation of the policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." However, if such two-sided struggles are not carried out in society, if such two-line struggles against "leftism" and rightism are not carried out in party and government organs, then the correct implementation of this policy cannot be guaranteed, the New Democratic economy cannot be developed, and either the error of agricultural socialism or the error of the capitalist road will be committed. This is what all communists and revolutionary cadres must understand.

### 正确执行劳资两利方针

　　正确执行劳资两利方针
    今天本社所广播的关于哈尔滨市劳资关系的消息中，反映解放区各地在普遍推广“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的正确政策并获得显著成效的生产建设运动当中，尚有部分私营工商业主曲解政府政策，任意侵犯工人学徒正当权利和侵犯人民政府利益的违法行为。这个情况在其他解放区也有发现，值得提起注意。
    “劳资两利”，是新民主主义的人民政府处理劳资关系的基本方针。所谓“两利”，就是说，为达到“发展生产，繁荣经济”的目的，必须同时兼顾劳资双方的利益，而不能只顾劳资任何一方而不顾对方的利益。过去许多地方，曾经错误地过分强调了工人一方面的暂时利益，忽视了资方利益，致使资方无利可图，甚至错误地搬用农村反封建斗争的方法来对付普通资本家，这些错误行动的间接或直接结果，不但损害了普通资本家，而且更严重地损害了工人本身。这种左的错误的偏向，近来各地都已纠正或正在纠正中，只要它继续存在，也还要继续纠正。但是，同样重要的，就是必须反对与防止另一种偏向，即是片面地强调资方利益，纵容资方违法犯纪，侵犯工人的法定权利而不加干涉，以至牺牲工人方面的基本利益。这也是违背了劳资两利的基本方针。
    解放了新民主政府，在过去、现在乃至将来革命在全国胜利以后的一个长时期内，与坚决执行消灭官僚资本主义政策同时，是允许一般资本主义经济的存在，是保护一切有益于国民经济的私营工商业的。但必须指出，新民主政府所允许和保护的，只是一切利益于国民经济的资本主义工商业，只是其合法的营业。如果其中有破坏国民经济的成份，有违反法令的行为，自然不在被允许保护之列，而应受到禁止与法律上适当的制裁。承认自由资产阶级在新民主主义的经济和政治组织中占一定的位置，并不等于取消或放松国家企业的经济领导和无产阶级的政治领导，或者把资本家的地位不适当地抬价到工人、农民之上，压迫工人农民。保护工商业主合法的正当的利益，并不是说因此就应该去无原则地有助其不利于国民经济的经营，就可以不注意保障工人应享有的各种权利。
    因此，在处理劳资关系问题上，各地党政领导机关，必须正确执行“劳资两利”的方针，反对“左”的和右的两种偏向。既要保障工人利益，又要适当地照顾资方利益，既要在经济上政治上适当地保护自由资产阶级；但当他们有违反人民及其政府利益的错误行为时，又必须进行适当的斗争，才能保证国家和社会的政治与经济循着有利于全体人民的正确方向顺利发展。凡是存在着“左”倾错误的地方，应说服工人照顾长远的利益纠正这种错误，在发生资本家违反政策法令事情的地方，则应劝导或命令资方遵守政策法令。对于少数不服劝导明知故犯或阳奉阴违的分子，则应由政府及有关方面分别轻重依法予以有效的处置。但是同时又须注意，不要由此而又重复左的错误，对于一切有益国民经济的中小资本家的合法营业，不采取坚决保护的方针而采取打击破坏的方针。一切有关的领导机关，应随时随地注意防止上述任何一种偏向的发生，保证“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的政策的正确执行。但是，如果在社会上不进行这样两方面的斗争，如果在党政机关中不进行这样反左与反右的两条战线斗争，那就不能保证这个政策的正确执行，就不能发展新民主主义的经济，就或者要犯农业社会主义的错误，或者要犯资本主义路线的错误。这是一切共产党员和革命干部必须了解的。
