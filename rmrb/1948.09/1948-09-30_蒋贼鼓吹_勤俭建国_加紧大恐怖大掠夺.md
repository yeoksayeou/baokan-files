Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. From various sources: As the bandit Chiang Kai-shek faces the crisis of total military, political, and economic collapse, he launched a so-called "National Construction Through Diligence and Thrift Movement" in a broadcast on the 15th. This head of the Four Big Families, notorious for sucking the people's blood, being thoroughly corrupt, shameless, and indulging in extravagance, actually started singing the tune of "diligence and thrift," which is utterly ridiculous. However, judging from the "program" he announced, this "movement" is a massive conspiracy to intensify the rule of secret agents and further squeeze the manpower and material resources of the Kuomintang-controlled areas, a great terror and great plunder by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries against the people. According to the Central News Agency, Chiang lamented in the "program" that his rule was encountering "great difficulties" and "great enemies," and the so-called "thrift movement" was "to thoroughly implement total war and concentrate the nation's (Kuomintang-controlled areas) manpower, financial resources, and material resources to maximize effectiveness" to "guarantee" his delusional so-called "suppression of the rebellion victory." This "movement" will rely on "basic organizations" of no more than fifteen people in various places to penetrate various regions, factories, shops, schools, troops, institutions, organizations, and professional groups to conduct deception, investigation, control, threats, and other activities. Its central goals: In the economic aspect, to cooperate with all the reactionary economic measures after the "currency reform," "assist in registering grain, manage the economy, universally launch a movement to expose 'smuggling,' and implement the economic blockade policy against the 'bandit areas' (a slanderous term for the liberated areas)," driving the people to "purchase stocks in state-owned and publicly-owned (bureaucratic capital) enterprises" and to participate in "savings competitions and foreign exchange deposits," etc. In the political aspect, to "prevent 'riots'," "conduct household registration checks," "rectify the Baojia system," and "report 'communist spies'," etc. In the military aspect, to "launch youth to join the army movement," etc. This "movement" is cloaked in the guise of "diligence and thrift" and "economy" on top of the above ugly original form. Now Chiang Kai-shek is ordering his minions to make a big noise in various parts of his controlled areas. An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 15th, reporting on this matter, pointed out: "If this plan becomes law, it will make China one of the most controlled areas in the world." "Many of the economy measures are already included in the Executive Yuan's original economy regulations, and almost none of them have won the support of the people." On the 17th, the Central News Agency revealed that the Catholic Church in Nanjing commented: "Economy is a matter that must be implemented by reducing the privileges and enjoyment of a few in the country (the Kuomintang area, same below). As for the vast majority of compatriots talking about economy today, it seems redundant, because most of the clergy, citizens, and laborers in the country today find it difficult to maintain a minimum standard of living with their income, let alone economy?"

### 蒋贼鼓吹“勤俭建国”　加紧大恐怖大掠夺

　　蒋贼鼓吹“勤俭建国”
  　加紧大恐怖大掠夺
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】综合各方消息：蒋贼介石因面临军事、政治、经济总崩溃的危机，于十五日广播发起所谓“勤俭建国运动”，这个以吸吮人民膏血、腐败彻骨、鲜廉寡耻、穷奢极欲而恶名昭彰的四大家族的头子，竟然唱起“勤俭”的调子，本来是滑天下之大稽，但是从他所宣布的“纲领”看来，这个“运动”是妄图加紧特务统治，进一步榨取国民党统治区人力物力的大阴谋，是蒋介石反动集团对人民的大恐怖和大掠夺。据中央社报导：蒋贼在该“纲领”中首先即哀鸣他的统治遭遇“大难”与“大敌”，所谓“勤俭运动”是“为了彻底实行总体战，集中全国（国民党统治区）人力财力物力，发挥高度效能”，以“保证”他幻想的所谓“戡乱胜利”。这个“运动”将依靠各地的十五人以内的“基本组织”，深入各地区、各工厂、商店、学校、部队、机关、社团和职业团体，进行欺骗、调查、控制、威胁等活动。其中心目标：在经济方面为配合“币改”后的一切反动经济措施，“协助登记粮食，管理经济，普遍发动检举‘走私’运动，贯彻对‘匪区’（对解放区的诬称）经济封销政策”，驱使人民“购买国营公营（官僚资本）事业股票”，“储蓄竞赛，外汇存款”等；政治方面为“防制‘暴乱’”，“清查户口”，“整顿保甲”，“检举‘匪谍’”等；军事方面为“发动青年从军运动”等。该“运动”在上述丑恶原形之外，披上“勤俭”、“节约”的外衣。现蒋介石正命令其喽罗在其统治区各地大事鼓噪。美联社十五日南京电于报导此事时指出：“假若该计划成为法律，则将使中国变为世界上最受控制的地区之一”。“许多节约措施早已包罗在行政院原先的节约条例里，几乎没有一条赢得人民的支持。”十七日中央社透露天主教南京市天主教的评论称：“节约是项须待国内（国民党区，下同）下数特权享乐现实物去实行，至于全国大多数同胞今日要来谈节约，似乎是一件多余的事，因为当前国内大多的公教人员、市民与劳动者，要以他们的收入来维持最低生活水准，已感困难，遑论节约？”
