　　What to Do About Those Who Vow to Perform Opera Due to Drought or Illness?
To the Editor:
　　In Caojiazhuang Village, Jianping District 1, there is a carpenter who vowed to perform opera for three days at the price of one stone and five dou of wheat, including food for the opera troupe, when his son fell ill this summer. The number of guests in the village greatly increased, resulting in significant expenses. Also, in Qingyangshu Village in the same district, a vow was made to perform a grand opera during the drought this year to pray for rain, which has now been completed, incurring substantial costs. Is this considered superstition and waste? Should the democratic government prohibit it?

　　Answer: Vowing to perform opera due to illness or praying for rain during drought by performing opera are both forms of superstition and waste. In addition to persuading and explaining to the masses, we should actively organize and lead them to pay attention to hygiene, conduct epidemic prevention, and develop medical services to combat diseases. We should lead, mobilize, and educate the masses to plant trees and grass. During droughts, we should lead the masses to seize water for planting and struggle against the weather. As the culture of the masses gradually improves and scientific knowledge is gradually promoted, they will not resort to vowing to perform opera to pray for blessings from heaven when illness or drought strikes. If, after understanding the principles, the masses still want to vow to perform opera, they should be allowed to do so, but education should continue to be strengthened to break superstition. Forcibly prohibiting it by the government at present will not only be ineffective but may also produce adverse results. And according to the degree of awareness of the masses, gradually improve their democratic consciousness.

### 因旱因病而许愿唱戏者怎办？

专栏：询问与答复

　　因旱因病而许愿唱戏者怎办？编辑同志：
    建屏一区曹家庄村有一木作工人，在今年夏天为儿子生病许下口愿唱了三天戏，戏价是一石五斗小麦，并管戏班伙食，全村客人大增，耗费很大。还有本区青杨树村，在今年天旱求雨时，许下唱天大戏，现在也唱完了，所耗费用甚巨。这是否算迷信浪费？民主政府应否禁止？
    　                        　　　建屏一区乔如
    答：因病许愿唱戏，天旱祈雨唱戏，都是迷信浪费，我们除了向群众进行说服解释外，更应积极组织与领导群众注意卫生，进行防疫，发展医药事业，和疾病作斗争。领导、发动和宣传广大群众造林种草等，旱时领导群众抢水点种，和天时作斗争。群众的文化逐渐提高，科学知识逐渐推广，因生病或天旱就不会去许愿唱戏而祈求上苍保佑了。若在搞明道理后，如群众还要许愿唱戏，应邀群众去唱，但仍应继续加强教育，打破迷信。目前由政府强行禁止的话，不但不会有效反会产生恶果。并根据群众觉悟程度，逐渐去提高自己的民主意识。
