　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th: The Northeast Liberated Areas are actively welcoming the first harvest after the land reform. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Agricultural Department of the Northeast Political Committee, and the provinces of Hejiang, Nenjiang, and Heilongjiang have all called on local areas to strengthen organizational leadership, mobilize all men, women, and children, and various livestock to cooperate with each other on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis, and harvest in a timely manner to avoid damage to the grain from wind disasters, early frost, and early snow. Before and after the autumn harvest, all localities should organize farmers to carry out various sideline productions and prepare for next year's large-scale production, paying particular attention to accumulating fertilizer, collecting manure, selecting seeds, and increasing next year's grain yield. The Northeast Bureau's instructions emphasized: The local armed forces and main forces in the areas bordering the enemy should take the struggle to protect the autumn harvest and grain as their main task at present. The Hejiang Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government instructed leading cadres at all levels to immediately shift from other work to preparing for the autumn harvest. The joint instructions of the Nenjiang Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government required that practical assistance be given to elderly and widowed dependents of soldiers, dependents of martyrs, and dependents of war laborers to ensure that they can harvest in a timely manner without encountering difficulties. It is necessary to vigorously organize surplus labor in cities to sell labor to areas lacking labor and carry out crash harvesting. Rural branches and party members in various places, as well as labor models in production, should actively play a leading, exemplary, and bridging role to ensure the successful completion of the autumn harvest.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd】If there are no unexpected natural disasters before the autumn harvest, the Northeast Liberated Area is expected to complete the plan to increase production by 12% compared to last year. This is the result of developing production and initially overcoming natural disasters after the equal distribution of land. The main problems that still exist in the countryside are due to the remnants of past leftist influences, and because some cadres and peasant activists still have agricultural socialist-style absolute egalitarian ideas, many farmers are still worried about whether there will be "re-distribution" after they become wealthy through developing production. Some district and village cadres also regard the organization of farmers' labor to participate in mutual-aid plowing teams as a "means of equalizing production," thinking that now is the time to "share blessings, do work together, and in a communist country, it is not right to stand out; whoever stands out is unequal"; and they use coercive methods to implement so-called "universal organization," requiring "the entire village to be incorporated into mutual-aid teams, not allowing a single household to work alone." In order to correct these erroneous concepts and put the development of production and the organization of labor on a sound track, the Northeast Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Consolidate Farmers' Enthusiasm for Production, Improve the Organization of Mutual-Aid Plowing Teams." The editorial once again announced that in the basic areas, the anti-feudal struggle has been completed, the Party's policy is to determine land rights, allow and reward wealth through labor, allow free lending, wage labor, and tenancy under specific conditions, and strive to reduce the burden on the people as much as possible and make it fair and reasonable. Regarding the issue of organizing the masses for production, the editorial emphasized that it is necessary to adhere to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and to adopt gradual organization and gradual expansion based on the awareness and demands of the masses, resolutely opposing infringement on private property rights and the freedom of independent labor. The editorial pointed out: In order to achieve the goal of implementing the Party's correct policies, it is necessary to seize the current opportunity to universally hold short-term training classes for district and village cadres, summarize the experience of the production movement, correct the egalitarianism and commandism of cadres, and strengthen the education on various policies and work styles that are directly related to their work, in order to win the victory of this year's autumn harvest and lay a good foundation for next year's agricultural production.

　　东北积极迎接丰收
    注意积肥选种提高明年粮食产量
  　纠正左倾残余加强政策作风教育
    【新华社东北二十日电】东北解放区各地积极迎接土地改革后的第一个丰收。中共中央东北局、东北政委会农业部及合江、嫩江、黑龙江等省均号召各地加强组织领导，动员全体男女老少与各种畜力，在自愿与两利的基础上互助合作，及时收割，以免遭受风灾、早霜、早雪糟踏粮食。各地在秋收前后，并应组织农民进行各种副业生产，及准备明年大生产，特别注意积肥起粪，选种留种，提高明年粮食产量。东北局指示中强调指出：接敌区地方武装与主力部队，应把护秋护粮斗争，作为当前主要任务。合江省委、省府指示各级领导干部应立即从其他工作上转到准备秋收上来。嫩江省委、省府联合指示中，要求对孤寡军属、烈属、战勤家属等予以切实帮助，保证他们及时收割，不受困难。要大力组织城市多余劳力到缺少劳力的地区卖工，突击收割。各地农村支部与党员，生产中的劳模，应积极发挥领导、带头与桥梁作用，保证秋收圆满进行。
    【新华社东北二十二日电】东北解放区在秋收前如无意外灾荒，可望完成较去年增产百分之十二的计划。这是平分土地后发展生产和初步战胜灾荒的结果。现在农村中还存在着的主要问题，就是由于过去左倾影响的残留，由于一部分干部和农民积极分子还有农业社会主义式的绝对平均思想，许多农民在发展生产当中仍然顾虑着发家之后会不会“再平分”。某些区村干部在组织农民的劳动力参加插犋换工时，也看成是“均产手段”，以为现在是“有福大家享，有活大家干，共产国家，不兴冒尖（出头），谁冒了尖，就是不平等”；并用强迫方法实行所谓“普遍组织起来”，要求“全村编入换工组，不让一家单独干”。为纠正这些错误观念，使发展生产、组织劳动力走上健全的轨道，东北日报在最近发表了“巩固农民生产热情，改善插犋换工组织”社论。该社论再一次宣布在基本区反封建斗争已经完成，党的政策是确定地权，允许并奖励劳动致富，允许自由借贷、雇佣劳动和特定条件下的租佃，以及力求可能的缩减人民负担，并使之公平合理。关于组织群众生产问题，社论强调必须坚持自愿两利的原则，必须在群众觉悟与要求的基础上采取逐步组织，逐步扩大的办法，坚决反对侵犯私有权与独立劳动自由权。社论指出：为了达到贯彻党的正确政策的目的，必须抓紧目前时机，普遍举办区村干部短期训练班，总结生产运动的经验，纠正干部中的平均主义和命令主义思想，加强与他们的工作有直接联系的各种政策作风的教育，以争取今年秋收的胜利，并给明年的农业生产打好基础。
