Xinhua News Agency, East China, 25th: The Shandong Provincial Government has recently issued a circular on the protection of ancient cultural relics and established the Shandong Ancient Cultural Relics Management Committee. Local management committees will also be established in various regions. The committee has already collected hundreds of precious items in Binbei, Bohai, Jiaodong, Weifang and other places, including oracle bones from the Yin Ruins, bronzes, tripods, pots, mirrors, and pottery from the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Wei dynasties, as well as porcelain, ancient jade, ancient coins from various dynasties, famous paintings and calligraphy from the Ming and Qing dynasties, rare books from the Song and Yuan dynasties, ancient rubbings from stone inscriptions, and calligraphy, and more than two thousand books. Many of these items were voluntarily donated by local people after understanding the democratic government's policy of protecting ancient cultural relics. The committee is currently sorting and properly preserving them.

In other news: When our army liberated Yanzhou, it seized fifty boxes of ancient artifacts from the Confucius Temple in Qufu. These artifacts were secretly transported to Yanzhou by Kong Lingshu, a degenerate descendant of Confucius, in collusion with Kuomintang bandit troops before the liberation of Qufu, with the intention of transporting them abroad. After identification by the Shandong Ancient Cultural Relics Management Committee, to which our receiving agency handed them over, it was determined that ten Zhou dynasty bronzes were ancient treasures, which were first given to the Confucius Temple during the Qianlong period of the Qing dynasty to be displayed during the spring and autumn ceremonies and usually stored in the inner treasury. It was truly inappropriate to transport them abroad, and they have been taken into custody by the committee. The remaining items, such as the Han offering vessels, golden bells, and jade chimes inscribed with the words "Confucius Temple," were returned to the Confucius Temple for use. A portion of the items that belonged to the personal belongings of the Kong family were all returned to their original owners.

　　山东
  　征集保存古代文物
    【新华社华东二十五日电】山东省政府顷发出保护古代文物通令，并成立山东古代文物管理委员会，各地亦将建立地方管理委员会。现该会已在滨北、渤海、胶东、维坊市等地搜集到殷墟甲骨，周、秦、汉、魏之钟、鼎、壶、镜、陶器，历代瓷器、古玉、古钱，明、清名人书画，宋、元善本书、古拓碑帖、字画等珍品数百件，藏书二千余册。其中不少是地方人士在了解民主政府保护古代文物之政策后，先后自动捐献者。现该会正整理并妥为保存中。
    又讯：我军解放兖州时，曾查获曲阜孔庙古物五十箱，系孔子不肖子孙孔令淑于曲阜解放前，勾结国民党匪军私运抵兖，准备外运者。经我接收机关移交山东古代文物管理委员会鉴别结果，其中周代铜器十件，为古代珍物，清乾隆年间始给孔庙于春秋两祭时陈列，平时收藏内库，此次竟被外运，实属不合，已由该会保管；其余如汉供五器、金钟、玉罄等铸有孔庙字样者，仍发回孔庙应用；其中一部分属于孔氏私人之用品，全部发回原主。
