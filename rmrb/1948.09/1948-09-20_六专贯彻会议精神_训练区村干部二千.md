　　Sixth Special District Implements the Spirit of the Conference
　　Training Two Thousand District and Village Cadres
　　[Our Newspaper News] The Taihang Sixth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party reported: In order to thoroughly implement the resolutions of the August meeting of the District Party Committee (County Committee Joint Meeting), complete the land reform, party rectification, and political construction, and launch the winter production campaign, each county in the Sixth District has successively convened expanded cadre meetings, training more than two thousand district and village cadres. The meetings conveyed, studied, and arranged the work for the autumn and winter seasons, and preparations are being made to train another three thousand people before winter, for a total of five thousand people. Before the meetings, most cadres were concerned about party rectification after the autumn harvest and felt unable to lead the work. The masses were also waiting for land redistribution after the autumn harvest and were in an uneasy mood. During the meetings and training, each county reviewed past work and the extent of land reform, explained policies with specific issues, allowing the vast number of cadres to understand the policies thoroughly. After studying various specific issues in class demarcation and the conclusion of land reform, realistic plans were formulated, and work was arranged. Everyone became clear about the general principles and policies, work tasks, and goals. After the meetings, in order to quickly stabilize the farmers' production sentiment and promote the autumn harvest and wheat planting, each county, based on specific circumstances, pre-set the villages to conclude land reform before autumn. Thirty-two in Shahe, forty-nine in Shexian, one hundred and thirty in Cixian, and sixty-nine in Wu'an. These villages were assigned a certain number of cadres to begin various specific tasks to conclude land reform. It is generally expected that it can be completed in about twenty days (Cixian has too many villages to conclude, and it is not certain that all can be completed). At the same time, some cadres were also assigned to lead the masses to collect fertilizer in preparation for planting wheat. The cadres leading the conclusion of land reform also started by leading production to understand the situation. They also convened party member meetings, peasant association group meetings, mass meetings, and other gatherings to publicize policies, and then specifically proceeded. Currently, each county is carrying out the work intensely.

　　六专贯彻会议精神
  　训练区村干部二千
    【本报讯】中共太行六地委报导：六专各县为贯彻区党委八月会议（县委联席会）决议完成结束土改，整党，建政，开展冬季生产运动，各县均先后召开了扩大干部会议，训练区村干部达两千余人。传达研究布置了秋冬两季工作。并准备在冬前再训练三千人，共五千人。会前，干部大多对秋后整党有顾虑，对工作感觉无法领导。群众亦在等待秋后抽补土地，情绪不安。会议及训练中，各县都回顾了过去工作和土改程度，用具体问题解释了政策，使广大干部对政策摸了底。并经研究划阶级与结束土改中各种具体问题，实际订计划，安排工作，大家对方针政策与工作任务、目的都明确起来。会后，各县为迅速安定农民生产情绪，推进秋收种麦，都根据具体情况，预订了秋前结束土改村庄。沙河三十二个；涉县四十九个；磁县一百三十个；武安六十九个。这些村都配备一定的干部开始进行各种具体的结束土改工作。一般预计二十天左右可以完成（磁县结束村太多，不一定都能完成）。与此同时，也配备了一部分干部领导群众集肥，准备种麦。领导结束土改的干部，也是先从领导生产入手，了解情况。同时召开党员会、农会小组会、群众大会等宣传政策，然后具体进行。现各县均在紧张进行中。
