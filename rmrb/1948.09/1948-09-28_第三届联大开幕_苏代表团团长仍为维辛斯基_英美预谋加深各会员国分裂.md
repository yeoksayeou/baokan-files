Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: TASS reports: The Third United Nations General Assembly opened at 3:20 PM on September 21st at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris. Representatives from 58 countries attended the assembly. The agenda includes approximately 70 items, including many issues of great importance to the peace and security of all nations. However, on the eve of the assembly's opening, Western newspapers launched a propaganda offensive to spread doubts about the assembly's success and to deepen divisions among member states. A spokesman for the US delegation revealed the purpose of this offensive, namely that they feared the Soviet Union would once again take the initiative in the assembly and use the assembly's platform to fight against warmongers. After the opening remarks by Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, in his capacity as temporary president of the assembly, and a welcoming speech by French President Auriol, in his capacity as host country, the assembly proceeded to elect the various organizations of the assembly. Because the US-controlled group was determined to occupy all important positions with its supporters, at the expense of undermining the UN Charter's tradition that assembly positions should be distributed according to geographical fairness, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, a faithful accomplice of the US-British bloc, was elected as the President of this session of the General Assembly after a vote. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, who had actively served the interests of the Anglo-American group in the previous session, was elected as the Chairman of the Political and Security Committee of the General Assembly. The chairmanships of the other five committees—Finance and Economy, Social and Humanitarian, Trusteeship, Administrative Budget, and Legal—were also seized by representatives from Chile, Lebanon, Iran, Canada, and Panama, all members of the US-British group. The results of the first day of the assembly proved that the majority of the assembly preferred to move the voting machine to advance the interests of the Anglo-American group. The assembly will elect seven vice-presidents on the 22nd, and then the president, the seven vice-presidents, and the chairmen of the six committees will form the fourteen-member steering committee of the assembly.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Reports from various sources: Delegations from various countries attending the Third United Nations General Assembly have successively arrived in Paris. The Soviet delegation arrived in Paris by plane on the 20th, led by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, who delivered a famous speech at the UN General Assembly last year denouncing war profiteers. Members of the delegation included Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Soviet representative to the Security Council Malik, Ambassador to France Bogomolov, Ambassador to Belgium Pavlov, and Soviet Foreign Ministry official Yarujian. The US and British delegations, headed by Marshall and Bevin respectively, arrived in Paris on the 20th. The notorious American warmonger and Republican Dulles remains a representative of the United States. Delegations from other countries have either arrived or are en route. It is said that the agenda of this UN General Assembly includes more than seventy items, and the session is estimated to last more than two months. The Soviet newspaper Pravda pointed out that in the course of the meeting, "the US-British group will try its best to turn the United Nations into a tool of their foreign policy." But this attempt will inevitably be resolutely countered by the anti-imperialist camp led by the Soviet Union. Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Clementis declared on the 19th, when departing for Paris, that the Czechoslovak delegation would defend the principles on which the United Nations was founded.

　　第三届联大开幕
  　苏代表团团长仍为维辛斯基
    英美预谋加深各会员国分裂
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社报导：第三届联合国大会于九月二十一日下午三时二十分在巴黎夏洛宫开幕。大会到有五十八国的代表，议程约达七十　项，其中包括许多对各国和平与安全具有重要意义的议题。但在大会开幕前夕，西方国家的报纸为了散布对大会成功的怀疑及加深各会员国间的分裂，发动了宣传攻势。美国代表团发言人道出了这种攻势的用意，即他们唯恐苏联再次在大会中取得主动，并利用大会讲坛与战争贩子作斗争。大会在阿根廷外长布拉马格里亚以大会临时主席资格致开幕词及法总统阿里奥尔以东道国资格致欢迎词后，即进行大会各组织的选举工作。由于美国控制下的集团决心以其拥护者占据一切重要职位，不惜破坏联合国宪章关于大会职位应遵照地域公平分配的传统，经表决结果，美英忠实的走卒澳外长伊瓦特被选为本届大会主席。上次大会中曾为英美集团积极效力的比外长斯巴克被选为大会的政治安全委员会主席，其他财政经济、社会人道、托管、行政预算及法律五个委员的主席，亦分别为美英集团中的智利、黎巴嫩、伊朗、加拿大、巴拿马五国代表所盘据。大会头一天的结果证明：大会的多数宁愿拨动表决器以增进英美集团的利益。大会将于二十二日选举大会副主席七人，然后由主席、七个副主席及六个委员会主席组成大会的十四人指导委员会。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】各方报导：出席第三届联合国大会的各国代表团，已相继抵达巴黎。苏联代表团于廿日乘机抵巴黎，团长仍为去年在联大会上发表著名痛斥战贩演说的苏联副外长维辛斯基。团员有苏副外长兼苏驻安理会代表马立克、驻法大使鲍格莫洛夫、驻比大使巴夫洛夫及苏外交部官员亚鲁疆。美、英两国代表团分别以马歇尔与贝文为首，于二十日抵达巴黎。美国著名战争贩子及共和党人杜勒斯，仍为美国的代表。其他国家的代表团，或则已抵达或正在途中。据称：这次联大议程共达七十余项，会期估计将历时两月以上。苏联真理报指出：在会议过程中，“美、英集团将竭力企图把联合国变成它们外交政策的工具”。但这种企图必将受到以苏联为首的反帝国主义阵营的坚决打击。捷外长克里门蒂斯十九日在启程赴巴黎时宣称：捷代表团将保卫创建联合国时所根据的原则。
