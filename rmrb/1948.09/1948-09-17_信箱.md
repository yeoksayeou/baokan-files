    Li Xiangting from Ji County, Liu Jingtang from Shen County: The questions you raised do not clearly describe the family's economic situation and working conditions, making it impossible to answer. Please send more specific details.
    Organization and Education Section, Jinnan Sixth Prefectural Party Committee Party School: Because the letter was received too late, the comrades from the Party School have likely dispersed. We will not answer the several questions raised regarding class designation. In the future, if you encounter difficult problems in your actual work, you can write to us at any time to discuss them.
    Zhang Mingqing from Anguo: Your letter regarding the compensation of middle peasants in Nanma Village, your county, and the corruption issues in the cooperative has been forwarded to the Anguo County Committee for investigation and resolution during the upcoming autumn settlement of land reform leftovers.
    Comrade Li Guoyi: The materials you provided, reflecting that Sun Jinxiang, the militia captain of Wangdao Village in the First District of Nanying County, is oppressing the masses and engaging in excessive eating and drinking, and that the district political commissar is not accepting opinions and even speaking abusively, have been forwarded to the Nangong County Committee for investigation and handling.
    Yang Haoming from Zhengzhuang Elementary School, Pingshan: The method you sent for treating rice leaf rollers is no longer necessary for publication, as the rice leaf roller season has passed. It has been sent to the Border Region Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry for reference.
    Cui Zhenhai from Tang County: Regarding the issue of your cloth shop in Tang County being confiscated by your village during last year's land reform, you can request the county and district governments to return it or compensate you based on the actual situation.
    A reader from Central Hebei said that the issues you raised regarding how to correct the work in the village are very good. We have tried to find out more information. We hope you can provide more specific facts and problems, and please include your name and address in your letters.
