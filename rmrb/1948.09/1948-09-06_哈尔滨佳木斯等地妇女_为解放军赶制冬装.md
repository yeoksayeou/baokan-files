Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st: Women in Harbin, Jiamusi, and other cities are actively and meticulously making winter clothing for the People's Liberation Army. In the five districts of Jiamusi City, women have made more than 22,700 sets of winter clothing in the twenty days from the 12th of last month to the end of the month. In the fourth district and seventh street, the first batch they took on was 400 sets, and by the third time, they took 1,000 sets, which was still not enough to distribute. Women in Harbin are vying to participate in the wadding factories for sewing. In addition to the original 23 wadding factories in the city, 12 more wadding factories will be added this month. The production quality of each wadding factory is rapidly improving. In Majia District, the clothes made in the first two days did not meet the standards, and many were returned for rework. After the seventh day, on average, only one set, or even none, was returned. The production volume also increased daily with the proficiency of the techniques. Generally, each person can quilt one to one and a half sets per day, with the highest reaching three and a half to four sets.

　　哈尔滨佳木斯等地妇女
  　为解放军赶制冬装
    【新华社东北一日电】哈尔滨、佳木斯市等地妇女正积极精工细作的为解放军赶制冬装。佳市五个区妇女自上月十二日至月底的二十天内，已制成冬装两万两千七百余套。四区七街第一次领做四百套，到第三次，领了一千套，还不够分配。哈市妇女争着参加絮行厂缝制。该市除原有之二十三个絮行厂外，本月内即将再增设十二个絮行厂。各絮行厂生产质量都迅速提高。马家区开始两天做的衣服不合标准，退回重做的很多，第七天后平均只有一套，甚至没有。生产量也随着技术的熟练日益增加。一般每天每人均能絮一套至一套半，最高的达三套半、四套。
