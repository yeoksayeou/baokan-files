Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 14th: TASS Moscow reports: *Pravda* published an article on the 8th entitled "Where Will the Nationalism of the Yugoslav Tito Group Go?" stating: The Tito group now only constitutes a minority within the Yugoslav Communist Party. It relies not on the trust of the Party, but on the administrative and police apparatus of Yugoslavia.

Furthermore, the Telepress Agency, Warsaw, reports: The central organ of the Polish Workers' Party, *People's Voice*, published an editorial on the 10th entitled "The Majority of Communists Within the Yugoslav Communist Party Oppose the Tito Group," stating: The Polish Workers' Party believes that the reign of terror in Yugoslavia will not last long. "More and more Yugoslav Communists are realizing that the Yugoslav Communist Party is completely isolated from the working-class parties of the world; they know that the leading organs of the Yugoslav Communist Party are running into the arms of the imperialist camp, and Yugoslavia is becoming increasingly isolated from the camp of peace and democracy. More and more Yugoslav Communists understand that among the enemies of the Yugoslav people, the nationalist enemies wearing the mask of patriotism are no less dangerous than foreign enemies, and the Tito group is, in fact, a greater enemy than any enemy outside Yugoslavia." The newspaper pointed out: The intensification of the Tito group's terror against loyal members of the Yugoslav Communist Party shows its increasing fear that the majority of Yugoslav Communist Party members know that the Tito group is an enemy of the Party and the nation. The newspaper believes that Yugoslav Communist Party members will not succumb to terror and will be able to lead the Party and the country back to the path of cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

    铁托集团日趋孤立
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报八日在题为“南斯拉夫铁托集团的民族主义会走到什么地步”的专文中称：铁托集团现在南斯拉夫共产党中只占少数，其所凭借的不是党的信任，而是南斯拉夫的行政和警察机构。
    另据电通社华沙讯：波兰工人党中央机关报“人民呼声”十日在题为“南共党内大多数共产主义者反对铁托集团”的社论中说：波兰工人党相信南斯拉夫的恐怖统治将维持不了多久。“越来越多的南共党员了解到南共完全孤立于全世界的工人阶级政党之外；他们知道：南共领导机构正在投奔帝国主义阵营，南斯拉夫正日趋孤立于和平与民主阵营之外。越来越多的南共党员懂得：在南斯拉夫人民的敌人中，戴着爱国主义假面具的民族主义者敌人并不小于外国敌人，铁托集团事实上是较南斯拉夫国外任何敌人更大的敌人。”该报指出：铁托集团对南共忠实党员所施的恐怖手段的加剧，表示它日益恐惧南共党员中的大多数知道铁托集团是党和民族之敌。该报相信，南共党员将不会对恐怖屈服，并将能把党和国家引回到与苏联及人民民主国家合作的道路。
