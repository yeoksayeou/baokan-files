Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 24th – The Jin-Sui “Front Line慰问团” and the People’s慰问团 of the Third Special District (which governs the counties of Linxian, Lishi, Zhongyang, and Fangshan) who went to the Jinzhong front lines to offer their condolences have returned in recent days. The慰问团 used meetings, informal discussions, and individual conversations at the front to solicit many valuable opinions from the front-line soldiers regarding work in the rear. The main points are: 1. Communication between the front and rear is not very good. Soldiers hope to understand the situation of land distribution and liberation at home and see letters from their families and villages. 2. The work of supporting the military has not been done well in some places. As a result, some soldiers' families have written to report difficulties in their family life, which affects the soldiers' morale. 3. After the news of meritorious service is sent to the rear, some local governments have not attached importance to congratulating the military families and mobilizing the masses to do so; some have not even sent it to the soldiers' homes. 4. Returning to the team is not regular. 5. The organization and education of civilian laborers participating in the war is poor, and some have poor discipline and do not listen to commands. The various rear organs attach great importance to these opinions and are now studying how to improve them.

The Third Special Commissioner’s Office, in light of the fact that the front-line troops are carrying out a commendation movement and the "News of Meritorious Service" is about to be sent back to the homes of meritorious personnel, specifically instructed all counties to clearly recognize that every "News of Meritorious Service" is exchanged by soldiers with boundless loyalty and bloody battles against the enemy. Therefore, they must assign certain cadres to personally deliver the news to the homes of the meritorious personnel and congratulate the families of the meritorious personnel; at the same time, they must earnestly mobilize the masses to congratulate the families of the meritorious personnel and convene mass congratulatory meetings to create an atmosphere of respect for military families and encourage the masses to actively join the army and participate in the war.

　　晋绥慰问团在前线
  　征得对后方工作的宝贵意见
    【新华社晋绥二十四日电】赴晋中前线慰问之晋绥“前线慰问团”及三专区（辖临县、离石、中阳、方山等县）人民慰问团，已于日前归来。慰问团在前方曾利用会议、漫谈及个别交谈等方式，征得前方将士对后方工作的许多宝贵意见。主要的有：一、前后方情况没有很好的沟通，战士们都希望了解家中分地翻身的情形，看到家里与本村的来信。二、优军工作有些地方没有做好，因此有的战士家属来信报告家庭生活困难，影响战士情绪。三、功臣喜报送到后方后，有的地方政府没有重视与发动群众给军属贺喜，有的甚至没有送到战士家中。四、归队工作不经常。五、参战民工组织教育差，有的纪律不好，不听指挥。各后方机关对这些意见极为重视，现正研究改进。
    三专署以前方部队正在开展评功运动，“功臣喜报”即将送回功臣家中，特指示各县，明确认识每一张“功臣喜报”都是战士以无限忠诚浴血歼敌换来的，因此必须责成一定干部将喜报亲送功臣家中，向功臣家属致贺；同时，认真发动群众给功臣家属贺喜，召开群众祝贺大会，以造成尊重军属的风气，并鼓励群众积极参军参战。
