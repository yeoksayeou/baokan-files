Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 26th: Jinan City has been completely liberated. The Political Department of the East China Military Region Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has specially ordered the establishment of the Jinan Special Municipality Military Control Commission. The order stated: "The Jinan Chiang bandits have been completely annihilated, and the people of the city are celebrating the liberation. However, the battle has just ended, and it is feared that there will be scattered soldiers, routed bandits, and lawless elements disturbing the peace and endangering the interests of the people. In order to establish revolutionary order, protect the lives and property of all the people, and maintain social tranquility, it is ordered that military control be temporarily implemented, and the Jinan Special Municipality Military Control Commission be established as the highest authority during the period of military control, unifying all military and administrative control matters in the city. Tan Zhenlin, Zeng Shan, Xu Shiyou, Guo Zihua, Yuan Zhongxian, Xie Youfa, and Liu Ziyuan are appointed as members of the commission, with Tan Zhenlin as the director and Zeng Shan as the deputy director.
