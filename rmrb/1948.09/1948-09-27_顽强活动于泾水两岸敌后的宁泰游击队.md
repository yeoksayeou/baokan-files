　　At the end of last year, Su Zhi, who was responsible for the work in a certain area of Xifu, deeply felt the difficulty of operating in enemy-occupied areas without armed forces. He sought and obtained approval from his superiors, and together with Zhao Yanfang, who had connections and prestige among the local people, actively planned to establish a guerrilla force.

　　When the guerrilla force was first established, there were only three people: Su Zhi, Zhao Yanfang, and a communications员 Su San De. However, on the day of its establishment, they held a grand ceremony, slaughtered a pig, and invited farmers from both sides of the Jing River to explain the purpose of building an army for the people. Su Zhi also used the example of Commander He's uprising with a kitchen knife to illustrate the greatness of the people's power and the bright prospects for development. The fame of "Zhao Yanfang's establishment of a guerrilla force" spread, and soon three hired laborers, unable to bear the oppression of the Kuomintang government's forced grain and conscription, ran away to join. Seven or eight young people from the Changning town area, fleeing the extortion and harassment of the local tyrant Lü Shisan, also ran to the guerrilla force; two of them automatically joined. Zhao Yanfang also invited three hired laborers who could not make a living to join. Then, a demobilized soldier of the People's Liberation Army, unable to stay at home, also invited four or five farmers to come; in addition, seven or eight farmers who had benefited from land reform voluntarily joined. By April of this year, the entire team had grown to thirty-five people. Thus, the "Ningtai Guerrilla Force" was officially formed, with Zhao Yanfang as the captain, Yang Guangyao as the instructor, and under the direct leadership of Su Zhi, to carry out the struggle against the enemy. When the People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the Jingwei River Valley in April of this year, a large number of farmers poured into the guerrilla force, and the team expanded even more rapidly.

　　After the guerrilla force was established, Su, Zhao, and Yang first taught the members the song of "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," and explained them item by item, so that everyone deeply understood the discipline of the people's armed forces. In addition, they often explained to the members Chairman Mao's report "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," "How to Be a Good Communist," "Manifesto and Slogans of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and other documents and news of victories, and launched discussions. Once, after reading a newspaper article on the "Malan Guerrilla Force," the members said: "We must catch up with them!" In order to make everyone remember the issues that should be observed and paid attention to, they posted notes in the accommodation places with sayings such as "Never beat or scold people, persuade people slowly with reason." Everyone also frequently struggled against erroneous behaviors and thoughts, such as a squad leader with a very bad character, who everyone was dissatisfied with. After repeated education, he did not change, and was finally purged. A member who failed to turn over captured items to the public, a member who killed a dog to eat, and a member who stole things were all corrected after timely education by everyone. A simple summary of each day's life was made during roll call in the evening, so that everyone was often vigilant and followed the rules. A squad meeting was also held once a week to encourage everyone to make suggestions to the leading comrades to improve leadership. From the beginning of its establishment, the team also paid attention to the work of supporting the government and cherishing the people. Whenever they went, they took advantage of the gaps to chop firewood, hoe wheat, weed, build pig pens, and carry water for the masses; and organized discipline inspection teams to strictly prohibit entering civilian houses, chatting with women, and borrowing things at will. They also paid attention to cultural learning, and checked learning results every week. For example, a squad leader who was originally illiterate can now copy the names of the team members. They paid great attention to party member education, established the core leadership of the party, held party lessons once a week, and required party members to play a leading role in every task. Model party members such as squad leader Wang Sifu and squad leader Liu Yanxi emerged. Through the above-mentioned education, the political awareness of the members was greatly improved, and they began to develop the habit of contacting the masses, observing discipline, and obeying command. The troops became increasingly consolidated as they expanded, and there has never been a desertion since the establishment of the troops.

　　Due to the purity of the team's composition, high political awareness, and extremely strong morale, they have achieved great results in more than half a year of struggle against the enemy. Before the People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the Jingwei River Valley, they crossed the Jing River and operated in the enemy area more than 30 times, supporting local work, destroying enemy bunkers and fortifications, and attacking the enemy. When the People's Liberation Army launched an attack, they actively cooperated in combat, and successively captured more than 200 machine guns and rifles, more than 10,000 bullets, and more than 1,000 grenades. After the main force was transferred, they continued to persist in guerrilla warfare in their original locations, covering local work. When the enemy invaded Guanzhong in August, a part of the team crossed the Jing River again and inserted into the Yongshou area. In one month, they repelled more than ten enemy invasions. On the evening of August 10, they destroyed two enemy military trucks on the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway and captured eight enemies. They seized five tons of Qinghai salt and immediately distributed it to the local people. On the 11th and 12th, more than 380 members of the enemy Qian County and Yongshou "Self-Defense Forces" attempted to retaliate and sneaked into Changning town. They immediately went to meet the enemy and repelled them, killing or wounding 16 enemy soldiers including the company commander and below, and helped the people recover two stolen mules. The team only suffered one minor injury. Because they resolutely fought to protect the interests of the people, the local people automatically collected more than 2,000 bullets and some weapons and sent them to them, helped them deliver food, scouted for information, and 40 farmers and students voluntarily came to join the team, further expanding the troops.

　　In this way, this guerrilla force has been rapidly tempered into a strong force with good equipment, bravery in combat, ability to contact the masses, observe discipline, and obey command.

### 顽强活动于泾水两岸敌后的宁泰游击队

　　顽强活动于泾水两岸敌后的宁泰游击队
    去年年底，负责西府某地区工作的苏智，深感在敌占区活动没有武装的困难，就呈准上级，和在当地群众中有联系有威信的赵彦芳一起，积极筹划成立游击队。
    游击队开始成立时就只有苏智、赵彦芳和通讯员苏三德三个人。但成立那天，他们举行了隆重的仪式，杀猪请了泾河两岸的农民，说明为人民建军的目的。苏智并以贺司令员一把菜刀起义的例子，说明人民力量的伟大和发展前途的光明。“赵彦芳成立游击队”的声名传开了，不久就有三个雇工不堪国民党政府逼粮逼丁的压迫跑来参加。常宁镇一带有七、八个青年躲避恶霸吕十三的敲榨骚扰，也跑到游击队来；其中两人就自动参加了。赵彦芳又约了三个生活无法维持的雇工来参加。接着，一个解放军退伍军人因家里站不住也约了四、五个农民前来；另外又有得土地改革利益的七、八个农民自动参加。到今年四月，全队就发展到了三十五人。于是正式组成“宁泰游击队”，赵彦芳为队长，杨光耀为指导员，在苏智直接领导下进行对敌斗争。当今年四月解放军出击泾渭河谷时，大批农民涌进游击队，队伍更迅速扩大了。
    游击队成立后，苏、赵、杨首先教会队员“三大纪律、八项注意”歌，并逐条讲解，使每个人都深刻了解人民武装的纪律。此外，经常给队员讲解毛主席“目前形势和我们的任务”的报告、“怎样做一个共产党员”、“人民解放军宣言和口号”等文件和胜利消息，并发动讨论。有一次读了报上一篇“马栏游击队”，队员们就说：“我们一定要赶上它！”为了使大家记住应遵守和注意的问题，就在住宿地贴了“千万不要打人骂人，用道理慢慢说服人”等字条。大家并经常对错误的行为和思想进行斗争，如有一个班长，品质很坏，大家不满，经屡次教育不改，最后就清洗了。有个队员缴获不归公，有个队员杀狗吃，有个队员偷东西，都经大家及时教育后改正了。每天的生活都在晚间点名时作一简单总结，使大家经常有所警惕和遵循。每星期并开班务会一次，发动大家对领导同志提意见以改进领导。该队从成立开始也就注意了拥政爱民工作，每到一处就利用空隙替群众砍柴、锄麦、锄草、起圈、担水；并组织纪律检查组，严禁随便进民房，随便和妇女闲谈，随便借东西等。他们对文化学习也很注意，每周检查学习成绩，如原来不识字的一个分队长，现在已能抄下队员的名单。他们很注意党员教育，建立党的核心领导，每星期上党课一次，要求党员们在每件工作上都起带头作用，涌现了分队长王思富、班长刘彦秀等模范党员。经过上述种种教育，大大提高了队员的政治觉悟，开始养成了联系群众、遵守纪律、服从指挥的习惯。部队随着扩大而日益巩固，从部队成立到现在，始终没有发生逃亡现象。
    由于该队成份纯洁，政治觉悟高，士气极为旺盛。在半年多的对敌斗争中获得很大战绩。解放军出击泾渭流域前，他们就曾渡过泾水，到敌区活动三十多次，拥护地方工作，摧毁敌碉堡工事，袭击敌人。解放军出击时，他们积极配合作战，先后缴获机枪、步枪等二百多枝，子弹万多发，手榴弹千余枚。主力转移后，他们仍坚持原地游击战争，掩护地方工作。八月敌犯关中时，该队一部又渡过泾水，插到永寿地区。一月之间曾击退了进犯敌十余次。八月十日晚他们在西兰公路上毁敌军用大卡车二辆，俘敌八名。缴获青海盐五吨，当即散给了当地群众。十一、十二日，敌乾县、永寿“自卫队”三百八十余名企图报复，窜抵常宁镇，他们立即前往迎战，将敌击退。毙伤敌中队长以下十六人，并替老百姓夺回了被抢的骡子两头，该队仅轻伤一人。由于他们坚决作战保护人民利益，当地人民自动搜集了子弹二千多发和武器一部送给他们，帮助他们送饭，探消息，并有四十个农民和学生自动前来参加了该队，使部队进一步扩大了。
    这支游击队就是这样迅速地从斗争中锻炼成了装备优良、英勇善战、能联系群众、遵守纪律、服从指挥的坚强力量。（新华社西北电）
