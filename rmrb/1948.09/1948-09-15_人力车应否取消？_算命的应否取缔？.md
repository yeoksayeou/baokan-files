　　Should Rickshaws Be Abolished?
    Should Fortune-Tellers Be Banned?
    To the Editor:
    (1) Pingyao City has been liberated, and there are still many rickshaws on the streets. There are still people paying to ride in them. Although no military or government personnel have been seen riding, the people who do are local residents. However, I believe this is an inequality. My opinion: stipulate that rickshaws are only allowed to carry goods and not people, or abolish them altogether. Is this correct? What methods should be used to change this unequal phenomenon?
    (2) On the streets of Pingyao, there are two professional fortune-tellers. Because the bandit army in Pingyao kidnapped many people when they fled, the people are hoping for the return of their sons and husbands, and many are going to have their fortunes told. Should their activities be stopped? Can their deceptive methods be exposed?
    (Xiu Yun, Pingyao Branch of the Jinnan Bank)
    Answer: (1) Rickshaws in the city are an unreasonable phenomenon in an exploitative society. In the past, due to the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and feudal forces, some farmers and unemployed workers who had lost their means of production were able to make a living from this. However, if they are abolished immediately after the liberation of the city, it will inevitably lead to the unemployment of a large number of rickshaw pullers. Not only will it not solve their problems, but it will also make it impossible for them to live. The basic solution is still to start with the development of urban industry and commerce and transportation. When industry and commerce are prosperous and urban transportation is developed, people will not need rickshaws as a means of transportation. Rickshaw pullers can also find a way out in other areas and no longer have to pull rickshaws. At that time, rickshaws may be reduced or eliminated. Therefore, they should neither be abolished now nor should it be stipulated that they are only allowed to carry goods and not people. Doing so would reduce the income of rickshaw pullers and be detrimental to them.
    (2) Fortune-telling is a product of feudal society. Under certain conditions, that is, when the masses have not yet been organized and their level of awareness has not been raised, it has its market. Therefore, for fortune-tellers in newly liberated cities, persuasive mobilization should be used. Starting from their own interests, explain that this occupation has no future in the new society and advise them to engage in manual labor production or change their profession. The most important thing is to stabilize social order, develop mass culture, and develop production, so that the masses' level of awareness will gradually increase, and superstition will gradually be eliminated. Naturally, no one will go to have their fortune told. It is not good to forcibly ban it now.
    As for the families of Pingyao Chiang's soldiers who are hoping for the return of their children, they should think of ways from a positive perspective, such as through relationships, letters, or other means, to persuade their children to take advantage of every possible opportunity to break away from the Chiang-Yan bandits and return to the liberated areas. Fortune-telling is of no use. Local cadres should educate them and should not forcibly stop them. (Editor)

### 人力车应否取消？　算命的应否取缔？

专栏：询问与答复

　　人力车应否取消？
    算命的应否取缔？编者同志：
    （一）平遥城解放了，大街上的洋车还不少，仍然还有花钱坐车的人，虽然军政人员还未见有人坐，坐的都是本地群众，但我认为这是不平等的事，我的意见：规定洋车只准拉货，不准拉人，或是一律取消，这是否正确？应想什么方法来改变这种不平等的现象？
    （二）平遥大街上，有两个专门职业的算卦者，因为平遥匪军逃走时，抓走好多人，老百姓盼望自己的儿子、丈夫回来，去算卦的很多。这是否能停止他的活动，是否可以揭破他的骗人手法？
    （冀南银行平遥支行　秀云）
    答：（一）都市里的人力车，这是剥削社会里的一种不合理的现象，在过去由于帝国主义与封建势力的压迫剥削，一些失掉生产资料的农民与失业工人，得以此糊口。但城市解放后，若马上一律取消，必将造成大批洋车工人的失业，非但解决不了他们的问题，反将使他们无法生活。基本的解决办法还是应从发展城市工商业与交通工具着手，工商业繁荣城市交通工具发展时，人们不需要人力车做交通工具，人力车夫在别的方面也可找到生活出路，不一定再拉车，那时人力车可能减少或被淘汰。故现在既不应取消也不应规定只准拉货，不准拉人。因为如此会减少洋车工人的收入，反对洋车夫不利。
    （二）卜卦算命，是封建社会的产物，在一定条件下，即是当群众还没有组织起来，觉悟程度还未提高的时候，是有它的市场的。因此，对新解放城市的卖卜卦的人，应当用说服动员方式，从他本身利害出发，说明这种职业在新社会里是没有前途的，劝他从事动劳生产或改业。而最主要的，是安定社会秩序，开展群众文化，发展生产，使群众觉悟程度逐渐提高，迷信逐渐破除后，自然就没人再去算卦，现在强迫取缔是不好的。
    至于平遥蒋军家属，盼望子弟家里，应从积极方面设想办法，如通过关系，书信或其他方式，劝其子弟利用一切可能的机会脱离蒋阎匪，返还解放区。卜卦算命是无济于事的，当地干部应向他们进行教育，不可强行制止。　（编者）
