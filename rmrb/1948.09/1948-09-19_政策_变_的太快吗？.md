　　Is the Policy "Changing" Too Fast? To the Editor:
    I have found several issues that I would like to request be studied:
    Since the correction work began in Changzhi City, it has caused confusion in the minds of many party members and cadres. Generally, they feel that the policy is changing too fast, and they want to do a good job, but they can't grasp the bottom line and don't know how to do it right. Some are unwilling to correct the deviation, thinking that we struggled against them in the past, and now we have to return things to them, which is too embarrassing. Or they think that the correction should be done, but it is difficult to do because it is embarrassing. Some more confused party members and cadres say that correcting deviations is like cutting chives; after correcting one deviation, another one comes along. The policy on industry and commerce is a dead policy applied flexibly. Some say that if we didn't struggle in the past, the higher-ups wouldn't allow it, and now if we don't correct it, it's not allowed either. The policy is changing all the time. They also say that it took us a lot of effort to stand up in the past, and we only managed to stand up halfway. Now we have to return things to them (referring to those who were wrongly struggled against), and they turned over in one night and raised their heads again. Some say that the rich are still rich anyway, and the poor are still poor. What kind of "standing up" is this after two years of struggle? As a result, some party members and cadres are ideologically confused and work is passive, which makes the leadership feel very difficult. What kind of ideological education should be adopted for these comrades to make them active in their work? Please publish this in the newspaper.
  　　　　　　　　Gao Da, August 16th
    Answer: To solve some ideological problems of party members and cadres in correcting deviations, the most important thing is to strengthen policy study. The confused thoughts reflected in the letter are all caused by a lack of understanding of the party's general line and general policy at the present stage, as well as the general line and general policy in the land reform. First of all, it is necessary to clarify whether the "policy is changing too fast" to the extent that the comrades below "want to do a good job, but they can't grasp the bottom line"? In Chairman Mao's speech at the meeting of cadres in Shanxi and Suiyuan, he explained that the party's general line and general policy today is: "The revolution led by the proletariat, of the broad masses of the people, against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism." The general line and general policy in the land reform during this period of new democratic revolution is: "Rely on the poor peasants, unite with the middle peasants, and eliminate the feudal exploitation system step by step and with distinction, and develop agricultural production." This was not proposed today; it was clearly stated in On New Democracy a long time ago, and it has never changed. Why do comrades feel that the policy is changing quickly? This is because many of our comrades do not pay attention to study and forget the general line and general policy when implementing the policy, which leads to deviations. For example, in the land reform, if the elimination of feudalism is not thorough, and the poor and hired peasants are not relied upon, a right-leaning error is committed, which should be corrected. But if you infringe on the middle peasants and struggle against industry and commerce, forgetting that land reform is only to eliminate feudalism and forgetting that you should unite with the middle peasants, then you are leaning to the left, which must also be corrected. In this way, it seems that after correcting one deviation today, another one comes along tomorrow, correcting the left and then having the right, etc., as if the policy is constantly changing. In fact, the policy has not changed. It is that we have forgotten the general policy and general line in the implementation, sometimes leaning to the left and sometimes to the right. It is not that the policy is sometimes leaning to the left and sometimes to the right. The so-called correction of deviations is not simply a matter of correcting the left and correcting the right, but a struggle between the correct line and the wrong line. Understanding that correcting deviations is to correct mistakes and correctly implement the policy, some personal concerns, such as feeling embarrassed, will naturally be dispelled. The leading organs should also seriously and responsibly analyze and examine the causes of the errors and distinguish responsibilities, explaining that some problems were not clearly stated by the higher authorities and cannot be solely the responsibility of the lower levels. At the same time, based on the general line and general policy, analyze the nature of past errors and resolve the ideological knots of comrades. For example, some say: After struggling for half a year, we still have to return things; the rich are still rich, and what kind of "standing up" have the poor achieved? This is because they do not understand that land reform cannot eliminate poverty, because it does not eliminate all exploitation, but only eliminates feudal exploitation, freeing the rural productive forces from feudal exploitation. The purpose of land reform is to develop production. Therefore, the middle peasants should not be struggled against, because they are not feudal, they are producers, and they are still the main force in agricultural production in the old areas. To struggle against them is a mistake and should be corrected. Industry and commerce cannot be struggled against either, because they are not feudal exploitation, but an indispensable factor for developing production today. Naturally, correction and compensation should not be a matter of "eating what you spit out," but should pay attention to not causing fluctuations, not discouraging the masses, and not affecting production, because the purpose of correcting deviations is still to develop production. The ideas of absolute egalitarianism among the masses must be educated and explained. For example, if someone says, "After two years of struggle, what kind of 'standing up' have we achieved?" it is necessary to analyze it according to the specific situation. If his land is indeed much less than the average amount of land in the whole village, it should be appropriately supplemented to roughly the average amount. If his land is already close to the average amount in the whole village, or if there is a shortage of land in the whole village and it cannot be supplemented, then he should be patiently explained to. Party members and cadres should not be tailists who think that "whatever the masses say is what it is." This is abandoning the leadership of the proletariat. What is even more important is to pay attention to the ideological situation of party members and cadres at all times and places in the future, combine policy education with reality, and solve problems in a timely manner, so as not to cause ideological confusion and passive work.

### 政策“变”的太快吗？

专栏：询问与答复

　　政策“变”的太快吗？编辑同志：
    我发现有如下几个问题请作研究：
    自长治市进行纠偏工作以来，在许多党员干部思想上引起混乱，一般都感到政策转的太快，想把工作搞好，就是摸不住底，不知该怎样做才对。有的不愿纠偏，认为过去咱斗争了人家，今天又给人家退哩，太丢人，或认为纠偏应纠，就是丢人难干。有些更糊涂的党员干部则说，纠偏是割韭菜，纠了一个偏，又来了一个偏，工商业政策是死政策活运用，有的说过去不斗，上级不行，现在不纠又不行。政策是一会一会的在变。并说过去咱翻身费了九牛二虎之力，好容易才翻了半个身，现在还得给人家退，人家（指错斗户）一黑夜就翻了个身，且又抬起头来了。有的说反正有钱的还是有钱，穷人还是穷人，翻身翻了二年这叫翻了个啥。因而造成一部分党员干部思想混乱，工作消极。致使领导很感困难，对这些同志们的思想应采取何种思想教育，把工作积极起来，请在报上发表。
  　　　　　　　　高达　八月十六日
    答：解决党员干部在纠偏中的一些思想问题，最重要的是加强政策学习。来信中所反映的这些混乱思想，都是由于没有了解党在现阶段的总路线与总政策及在土改中的总路线总政策所引起的。首先要弄清楚是否“政策转的太快”，以致使下面同志“想把工作搞好，就是摸不住底”呢？毛主席在晋绥干部会议上的讲话中，说明党在今天的总路线和总政策是：“无产阶级领导的、人民大众的、反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命”。在这种新民主主义革命时期的土地改革中的总路线和总政策：“依靠贫农、团结中农，有步骤地、有分别地消灭封建剥削制度，发展农业生产。”这不是今天才提出的，早在新民主主义论中，就已说的明明白白，并且也从未改变。为什么同志们会觉得政策变的快呢？这是我们许多同志不注意学习，在执行政策时忘记了总路线和总政策，以致发生了偏差。譬如在土改中，消灭封建不彻底，没有依靠贫雇农，犯了右倾错误，应该纠正。但假如你又侵犯了中农，斗争了工商业，忘记了土改只是消灭封建，忘记了应该团结中农。这又左了，也得纠正。这样看起来是今天纠了一个偏，明天又来了一个偏，纠了左又有了右等，好象政策不断在变动，实际上政策并未改变，而是我们在执行中忘了总政策总路线，忽左忽右，并非政策忽左忽右；所谓纠偏也就不是单纯的纠左纠右的问题，而是正确路线与错误路线的斗争。明白了纠偏是改正错误正确执行政策，一些个人顾虑如觉得丢人难看等就自会打消。领导机关并应认真负责的分析检查错误原因并分清责任，说明有些问题，上面没说清楚，不能单由下级负责。同时并根据总路线总政策，分析过去错误的性质，解开同志们思想上的疙瘩。比如有的说：斗了半年还得退，有钱的还是有钱，穷人翻身翻了个啥？这就是不明白，土改并不能消灭贫穷，因为它并不消灭一切剥削，而只是消灭封建剥削，使农村生产力从封建剥削下解放出来。土改的目的就是发展生产。所以中农就不应斗，因为他不是封建，他是生产者，在老区还是农业生产上的主力，斗了就是错误，就应该纠正；工商业不能斗，也因为他不是封建剥削，而是今日发展生产所不可少的一个因素。自然纠正补偿也不是吃啥吐啥，而应注意到不引起波动，不给群众泼冷水，不影响生产，因为纠偏目的还是为了发展生产。对于群众的绝对平均主义的思想，必须予以教育解释，如说：“翻身翻了二年，翻了个啥”，必须根据具体情况，加以分析，如他的土地真正不够全村土地的平均数很多，应适当补够大体相当于平均数。如他的土地已和全村平均数相差不多，或全村土地缺少无法补够，则应向他耐心解释。党员干部不应尾巴主义的“群众说啥就是啥”，这样就是放弃了无产阶级的领导会更重要的，是以后应随时随地注意党员干部思想情况，政策教育结合实际，发现问题及时解决，就不致造成思想混乱工作消极。
