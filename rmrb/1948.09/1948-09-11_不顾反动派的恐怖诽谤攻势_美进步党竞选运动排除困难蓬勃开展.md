　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. TASS dispatch: Despite the organized campaign of terror and slander by reactionary forces, the American Progressive Party's election campaign is flourishing. Regardless of the repeated disruptions by fascist thugs, Wallace continues his tour of the Southern states. Even many of his hostile critics have said that Wallace's courage in the face of terror will win him huge support, especially among Black people. At the same time, the Progressive Party's vice-presidential candidate, Taylor, is also making an election tour of the Western states, regardless of the reactionary forces' violence. In several states, reactionaries are attempting to deprive the Progressive Party of the right to participate in the election through all sorts of legal tricks. Following Missouri, the Illinois electoral board, composed of both Democratic and Republican parties, decided on August 31st not to allow the Progressive Party to run in the state. Nevertheless, the Progressive Party will undoubtedly remain an important force in the election. Recent opinion polls show that the Progressive Party will win around one million votes in New York State and retain a significant influence in major states such as Illinois and California. Within labor organizations, although the CIO Executive Board passed a resolution on August 31st, after intense debate, by a vote of thirty-five to twelve to support Truman's election, the twelve major unions within the CIO that originally supported the third party, such as the Transport Workers Union and the Electrical Workers Union, still adhere to their position of supporting the Progressive Party.

　　不顾反动派的恐怖诽谤攻势
  　美进步党竞选运动排除困难蓬勃开展
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社讯：美国进步党的竞选运动虽在反动派有组织的恐怖与诽谤攻势下，仍在蓬勃地展开。不顾法西斯暴徒的一再捣乱，华莱士仍继续其在南方各州的旅行。即使许多敌视他的评论家也说了，华氏在恐怖行为面前所表示的勇气，将使他能赢得巨大的支持，尤其在黑人之中。同时，进步党的副总统候选人泰勒，也同样不顾反动派的暴行，正在西部各州作竞选旅行。在若干州内，反动分子企图以各式各样的法律诡计来剥夺进步党参加选举的权利。继密苏里州之后，伊利诺斯州由民主与共和两党组成的选举委员会，又于八月卅一日决定不让进步党在该州竞选。尽管如此，进步党无疑仍将为选举中的一支重要力量。最近的民意测验表明：进步党将在纽约州获得百万张左右的选票，并在伊利诺斯、加利福尼亚等大州保有重大的影响。在劳工组织中，虽然产联执行局于八月三十一日在激烈辩论后以三十五票对十二票通过支持杜鲁门竞选的决议，但产联中原来支持第三党的各大工会如交通工会、电气工会等十二个工会，仍坚持其拥护进步党的立场。
