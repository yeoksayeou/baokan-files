【Taihang Dispatch】In order to resolve civil disputes among the masses through consultation, the Pingshun County Government has emphasized mediation in judicial work, which has yielded significant results. This approach has proven to be highly suitable for the current rural situation. As a result of the large-scale production campaign and the completion of land reform in recent years, people's lives have improved and their awareness has increased, leading to a significant reduction in criminal cases. However, due to the relatively dispersed nature of land and property, the relationships between farmers have become more complex than before (such as jointly dividing houses and land, jointly using toilets, and jointly feeding livestock), and farmers are constantly experiencing some new disputes in their daily lives. According to a survey of several villages in the fourth, fifth, and seventh districts: in the past six months, there have been 88 disputes over jointly feeding livestock, 20 disputes over jointly using toilets, 38 disputes over land boundaries, 19 disputes over courtyards, and 15 disputes over jointly using farm implements. There have also been some debt disputes arising from cooperative production and jointly purchasing livestock. This is one of the main contents of the current judicial mediation work. After the masses were emancipated, they demanded to establish families and careers, and the broad masses of women demanded liberation, family democracy, gender equality, and freedom of marriage. Therefore, there are also many disputes over marriage relations and family issues in rural areas. According to statistics from five districts in half a year, there were 251 divorce and contract termination cases, which is another important content of judicial mediation work. If these problems can be properly resolved, it will have a positive effect on strengthening mass unity and promoting production. The sixth district of Pingshun has made remarkable achievements in mediation work. Within one month, 116 various disputes occurred in the district, of which 71 have been resolved by the village mediation committees (including 18 cases of family discord, 14 cases of quarrels, 8 cases of fights, 6 cases of wage issues, 6 cases of jointly feeding livestock, 6 cases of petty theft, 3 cases of land boundary disputes, and 10 other cases). By understanding the thoughts, distinguishing right from wrong, and resolving disputes fairly and reasonably in mediation, both parties can be satisfied and achieve unity in production. For example, Shi Menze, a mother-in-law in Ku＠ Village, had disagreements with her daughter-in-law and requested a separation. During the mediation, it was learned that there were often sick people in her family, and it would be more difficult to separate the family. Immediately grasping this point, they repeatedly persuaded her, and she was convinced after being explained to. The mother immediately said: "You are right. I will not be angry in the future. The more angry I get, the more difficult it will be." Her daughter-in-law also began to change her mind at this time: it would be more difficult to have children without help if the family was separated, and family discord would not benefit her at all. Therefore, not only did she not ask for a separation, but she also proposed to respect her mother-in-law and work hard to unite and produce. In order to strengthen this mediation work, the county decided on the following guidelines and specific practices for the future: (1) Except for major cases, civil disputes should be resolved by the village mediation committees as much as possible. As the saying goes, "A year of litigation is ten years of injustice." The current democratic government is certainly not the yamen of the past, but if things are brought to the village government, the ideological emotions of both parties will form further opposition. If it is brought to the district or county level, it will be even more wasteful of manpower and money, increase grievances, and sometimes it will not be a matter of solving the problem, but simply forming the phenomenon of "selling the land in front of the hall to fight for a breath." Therefore, it is very important to promote farmers to resolve disputes themselves. (2) Restore and transform the past mediation organizations in order to resolve problems in a timely and reasonable manner. The village chief should be the chairman of the committee, the civil affairs director should be the vice chairman, and then some villagers who have prestige, are selfless, and are good at mediating disputes should be elected to jointly form the mediation committee and carry out mediation work in conjunction with production. Problems related to each system can be jointly resolved with the responsible cadres of each system. For example, women's cadres should participate in solving women's issues. (3) Mediation work is a social work and an ideological education work. If all disputes between farmers are resolved well, it will remove obstacles to the central work and make the production movement a victorious one. This is the sole purpose of mediation work. Therefore, when mediating each problem, it must be combined with mobilizing the masses to carry out ideological education for the large-scale production movement.

　　平顺为加强农民团结生产
  　民事纠纷着重调解
    【太行电】为了以协商方式解决群众间的民事纠纷，平顺县府强调在司法工作中实行调解，收效很大。证明这种办法，非常适合当前农村中的实际情况。几年来开展大生产运动与完成了土地改革的结果，人民生活改善，觉悟提高，刑事案件大大减少，但因土地财产相对分散，农民相互间的关系较前复杂（如伙分房子土地，伙用厕所，伙喂牲口等），农民在日常生活中不断发生一些新的纠纷。据四、五、七三个区几个村庄调查：近半年来发生伙喂牲口纠纷八十八件，伙用厕所纠纷二十件，争地界纠纷三十八件，争房院纠纷十九件，伙使农具纠纷十五件。还发生了一些因合伙生产、伙买牲口而产生的债务纠纷。这是目前司法调解工作的主要内容之一。群众翻身后要求成家立业，广大妇女要求解放，要求家庭民主，男女平等，婚姻自由，因此农村中婚姻关系、家庭问题等纠纷也很多。据五个区半年内统计，离婚解约案件达二百五十一件，这是司法调解工作的另一重要内容。这些问题如能适当解决，对加强群众团结，推动生产将会发生良好效果。平顺六区在调解工作上已做出显著成绩。一个月内全区发生各种纠纷一百一十六件，已经各村调解委员会调解结束的有七十一件（计家庭不和十八件，吵嘴十四件，打架八件，工资问题六件，伙喂牲口六件，小偷六件，争地界三件，其他十件）。在调解中揣摸心思、分清是非，公平合理解决，就能取得双方满意，达到团结生产。如库＠村石门则婆媳不和，要求分家，调解时了解了他家里经常有病人，分开家实际困难会更多。当即抓住这点，多方劝告，一经解释就说通了。当娘的当场就说：“你们讲的对，我以后可不生气啦，过时光越生气越困难”。她儿媳这时也想转了：分开家生下小孩无人帮助，更困难，家庭不和对自己没有一点好处。因此不但不要求分家，还提出要尊重婆婆，好好团结生产。该县为了加强这种调解工作，决定今后方针与具体作法：（一）民间除重大案件外，尽量由各村调解委员会解决。俗话说：“一年官司十年冤”，现在的民主政府当然不是过去的衙门，但事情闹到了村政府，双方的思想情绪就会形成进一步的对立，如再闹到区上、县上，越发劳民伤财，增加冤气，甚至有时就变成不是解决问题，而单纯形成“为了争口气，卖了堂前地”的现象，所以发扬农民自己起来调解纠纷，非常重要。（二）恢复与改造过去的调解组织，以求及时合理解决问题。应以村长为主任委员，民事主任为副主任委员，再民选一些土改生产运动中有威信、大公无私、善于调解纠纷的群众，共同组成调委会，结合生产进行调解工作。和各系统有关的问题，可会同各系统负责干部共同解决。如妇女问题即要让妇女干部参加解决。（三）调解工作是一件社会工作，是一件思想教育工作，农民间发生的一切纠纷如果解决的好，就会扫除中心工作的障碍，使生产运动胜利开展，这是调解工作的唯一目的。因此在调解每一个问题时，就必须与发动群众进行大生产运动的思想教育结合起来。
