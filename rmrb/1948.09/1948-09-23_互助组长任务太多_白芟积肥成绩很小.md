　　Editor's Note: The mutual aid team is a production organization, and the team leader's main task is to lead production. In Baicun Village, many administrative tasks are piled on the mutual aid team leader, which greatly affects production leadership. This phenomenon is not unique, and many mutual aid teams have collapsed because of this in the past. This should be closely watched by all localities.
　　[Taihang Electric] In Baicun Village, Shexian County, the accumulation of fertilizer has been severely unsupervised for a month because the mutual aid team leader has too many tasks and has no time to lead production. The White Dew solar term has passed, and wheat is about to be planted, but the village is still short of two-thirds of the fertilizer needed. At the cadre meeting held at the end of August for all village mutual aid team leaders and above to review this situation, farmers Niu Fubao and Niu Yuhua said: "Last year's mutual aid was well led by the cadres: distributing life according to labor, doing whatever one could do, and organizing women to participate in production, cutting turf, cutting artemisia, and accumulating a lot of fertilizer. This year, the organization of women's labor is not good, the leadership is poor, and the results are not as good as last year." Niu Qiuzi said: "Strengthening the leadership in the team is right, but I am the mutual aid team leader, the substitute farming team leader, the ward head, the ditch head, and the storage team leader. The cooperative also asks me to collect arrears, and I am also asked to distribute military shoes, which makes me unable to attend to everything. How can I lead the mutual aid well?" After he said this, four or five teams raised this issue. After inspection and discussion, everyone unanimously proposed that no matter who is the team leader in the future, they should not have too many tasks and should focus on production. Finally, it was decided to quickly solve the problem of mutual aid leadership, adjust cadres, and quickly promote the fertilizer accumulation campaign. On the same night, a mass inspection was carried out in mutual aid groups, which also reflected the seriousness of the above-mentioned problems. As a result of everyone's discussions, it was necessary to adjust the cadres: Mutual aid team leader Yang Duanyuan was appointed as the substitute farming team leader, specializing in leading substitute farming work. Chen Hengchang was appointed as the mutual aid team leader, specializing in leading production. A deputy team leader was also hired. Then, the current production was studied. First, it was decided that the whole team would plant 117 mu of wheat. Based on 16 dan of fertilizer per mu, there was still a shortage of more than 1,700 dan. All male and female full and half laborers must be organized, and whoever can do what should be done, and labor should be used rationally. For example, female full laborers weeding vegetable fields, young children catching insects, male laborers making fertilizer, and old men and women sweeping manure, etc., the plan is to complete it within five days. And put forward the slogan: now compare manure piles, next May compare wheat piles, to encourage the masses to accumulate fertilizer.

### 互助组长任务太多　白芟积肥成绩很小

　　互助组长任务太多
  　白芟积肥成绩很小
    编者按：互助组是生产组织，组长任务主要是领导生产。白芟村把许多行政任务堆在互助组长身上，大大影响了生产领导。这种现象并不是个别的，过去曾因此垮了不少互助组，应该引起各地密切注意。
    【太行电】涉县白芟村由于互助组长任务太多，没时间领导生产，一个月来的积肥工作严重自流。白露已到，就要种麦，而全村肥料尚差三分之二。八月底召开全村互助组长以上的干部会议对此种情况进行检查时，农民牛福保和牛玉华说：“去年互助，干部领导的好：按劳力分配生活，谁能干啥就干啥，并组织妇女也参加生产，割草皮，割蒿子，积了好多肥。今年没有很好组织妇女劳力，领导差，成绩就不如去年。”牛秋子说：“加强组里领导是对的，就是我一个人担任着互助组长、代耕组长、闾长、渠头儿、又是保管组长，合作社收欠帐也找我，派军鞋也找我，闹得我顾了东顾不了西，那能领导好互助呢？”他这样一说，就有四、五个组都提出这问题。经过检查讨论，大家一致提出：今后不管谁担任组长，也不能任务太多，要以生产为主。最后决定迅速解决互助领导问题，调整干部，把积肥运动很快推动起来。当天黑夜以互助小组开会，进行群众性的检查，也同样反映了上述问题的严重。大家拉扯的结果，要调整一下干部：互助组长杨端元担任代耕组长，专门领导代耕工作。陈恒昌担任互助组长，专门领导生产。又聘请了一个副组长。接着研究了当前的生产，首先订出全组种麦一百一十七亩，每亩按上肥十六担计，还差一千七百余担，必须把男女全半劳力组织起来，谁能干啥就干啥，合理使用劳力。如女全劳力拔菜地草，小儿童捉虫，男劳力造肥，老汉老婆扫粪土等，计划五天内完成。并提出口号：现在比粪堆，明年五月比麦堆，来鼓励群众积肥。
