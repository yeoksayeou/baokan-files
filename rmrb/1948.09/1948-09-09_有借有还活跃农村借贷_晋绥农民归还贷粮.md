Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, September 5th—The severe disasters suffered by the Jin-Sui Border Region last year and the year before have now been largely overcome. Peasants in various places are actively returning government loan grain and grain borrowed among villagers. When the masses in villages like Xia Liushui in Baode discussed returning the loan grain, an old peasant named Kang Jinjin said, "During the famine in the Guangxu years, many people in our village starved to death. This year's disaster was even worse than that year, but fortunately, we had the help of our new government, and no one in the village died. Now, we must pay back what we borrowed, so that the government can help us again if we encounter difficulties in the future." Within a few days, the village handed over more than 3,000 jin of grain and 90 million yuan in loans. In the Jinpen Gou village of the Fifth District of Xing County, the logistics department of the military region helped with grain this spring, which solved the difficulty of sowing. Now, the villagers are enthusiastically returning the grain, and some peasants are personally delivering the grain to the cooperative. In Yonghe County, Jin-Southwest, the government instructed all districts and villages to recover wheat seeds borrowed last autumn in order to develop rural lending. Those borrowed between middle and poor peasants should be returned to the original owners. Those borrowed from landlords and rich peasants should be taken over by the village people's representative assembly since they are old debts before the land reform, and be kept as wheat seeds for this autumn. Note: In previous years, the democratic government issued loan grain and loans, but most of them were not recovered as stipulated, forming a semi-relief nature. As a result, on the one hand, some cadres shielded private embezzlement and corruption, and on the other hand, some people developed the idea of ​​relying on government relief, blurring the significance of loans for developing production and implementing self-reliance, and affecting the government's continued efforts to help the masses with production. At the same time, private lending in rural areas has also been hampered by the failure to provide adequate legal protection, hindering the development of lending relationships. This time, the return of public and private loan grain and loans will greatly benefit the revitalization of rural lending and the development of production.

　　有借有还活跃农村借贷
  　晋绥农民归还贷粮
    【新华社晋绥五日电】晋绥边区去年和前年所遭受的严重灾荒，现已基本上渡过，各地农民纷纷归还政府贷粮及农村互借粮。保德下流水等村群众商量归还贷粮时，老农康锦金说：“光绪年间的灾荒，咱村饿死不少人，今年灾荒比那年重，幸好有咱新政权帮助，全村一个人也没死。现在有借有还，以后再有困难政府才好帮助。”该村几天之内把粮食三千余斤，贷款九千余万元如数交清。兴县五区金盆沟等村今春曾由军区后勤部合作社帮助粮食一事，解决了下种时的困难，现各村村民均踊跃还粮，有的农民亲自把粮送上合作社去。晋西南永和县政府为发展农村借贷，特指示各区村归还去秋互借的麦籽，中贫农互借者归还原主，借自地富者，因系土改前之旧债，一律收归村人民代表会保存，作为今秋麦籽。按：民主政府历年发放贷粮贷款，绝大部分均未按规定收回，形成半救济性质，其结果一方面造成某些干部包庇私人贪污腐化的不良作风，一方面又造成一部分群众经常依赖政府救济的思想，模糊了贷款的发展生产实行自救的意义，影响政府继续发挥力量扶助群众生产。同时，农村私人借贷亦因未能很好予以合法的保障，阻碍了借贷关系的发展。此次归还公私贷粮贷款，对活跃农村借贷，发展生产大有裨益。
