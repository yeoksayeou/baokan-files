Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 26th—The Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Plains Bureau issued instructions on propaganda work on August 15th. The original text is as follows:

　　(1) Although propaganda work has achieved some successes in the past, it has serious weaknesses. The main weakness is that our propaganda work has not been done well enough, and we have not conducted systematic ideological struggles with the enemy. There are many incorrect aspects in publicizing the Party's propositions and policies. There is a lack of sufficient investigation and research into the social conditions, the people's lives and ideological state in the Central Plains New District, and the enemy's propaganda activities. Therefore, the content of propaganda is often not fully in line with the actual situation in the New District and the demands of the people. Facts prove that because the New District has been under the rule and influence of the Kuomintang for a long time, because the general public does not know much about our Party, our army, and our propositions and policies, because the ideology and emotions of cadres and soldiers are prone to change after entering the New District, and because we are not familiar with many things in the New District and need good research and guidance, propaganda work must be particularly strengthened. We should educate the entire Party and army to become propaganda fighters, carry out propaganda work at all times and places, combine it with the local social situation and the people's lives, use facts and materials familiar to the masses, publicize the current situation and our propositions and policies, expose and combat the enemy's rumors and deceptions, establish their ideological positions in the New District, and liberate the masses from the influence of Kuomintang's arbitrary propaganda.

　　(2) Based on the recent instructions from the Central Committee, the New China News Agency editorial, and the Central Bureau's "66 Instructions," we have formulated the following general propaganda points. Various localities can refer to these points and formulate their own more specific propaganda guidelines based on the actual situation:

　　A. Publicize that Chiang is bound to be defeated and we are bound to win, expose the fake peace conspiracy of the American imperialists and the Chinese reactionary group, and call for overcoming difficulties and striving for the nationwide victory of the People's Liberation War. Explain that any operational plan of the US-Chiang has failed, the overall strategy is in a passive state, Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary group have completely lost popular support, and are on the verge of final collapse. Our march into the Central Plains has great significance and has achieved great success. The complete liberation of the Central Plains is not far off. Although we may still have temporary and local difficulties, we should not underestimate the enemy in specific struggles, but we must not exaggerate the difficulties. Any difficulty can be overcome. We advocate peace and are willing to end the war as soon as possible. The civil war was created by the US-Chiang. Today, the American imperialists' fake peace conspiracy is only an attempt to allow the Kuomintang to gain a respite, reorganize its forces, and make a comeback. Without overthrowing the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and without allowing the aggressive forces of American imperialism to withdraw from China, China will not have true peace and democracy. American imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries are outwardly strong but inwardly weak and can be defeated. The war launched by the US imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek is a counter-revolutionary war. Our opposition to the US-Chiang is a people's liberation war, which has two different natures. Only the victory of the People's Liberation War can liberate the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. The New China News Agency’s editorial, "A Summary of the Two Years of the People's Liberation War and the Tasks of the Third Year," should be widely and repeatedly publicized among the masses.

　　B. Distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, combat the enemy's rumors and deception, and win over the masses. The Communist Party represents the people of the whole country, and the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government are the people's own army and government. They take the people's will as their will and strive for the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. Our basic proposition is to unite people from all walks of life to form an anti-American and anti-Chiang united front, overthrow the reactionary rule of the American imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek, and establish a democratic coalition government. All our policies, laws, and measures are for the benefit of the people. The Kuomintang, the Kuomintang army, and the Kuomintang government represent imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital. Their rule is the rule of a few warlords, bureaucrats, compradors, and landlords. They sell out the country to foreigners and oppress the people internally. They seize recruits, levy grain, impose taxes, extort and plunder, issue paper money indiscriminately, are corrupt and degenerate, and run rampant without regard to the law. Everything is for the benefit of a few people, forcing the majority of the people to be unable to live. The liberated areas and the Kuomintang areas are two societies and two systems, and the people's lives are fundamentally different. Kuomintang reactionaries spread rumors and slander against the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, distorting the policies and decrees of the democratic government. Their purpose is to undermine the people's own army and government, so that the people cannot turn over and continue to be subjected to their rule and oppression. We will definitely stand firm, the reactionary forces will definitely be defeated, and the world will definitely belong to the common people.

　　C. Publicize the reasons for the current cessation of land reform and the implementation of rent reduction and interest reduction and reasonable burden. The current rent reduction and interest reduction is the first step in land reform and a preparatory step for the complete reform of the land system in the future. In areas where land reform has been implemented, the vested interests of farmers should be guaranteed, and landlords should not reverse the settlement, which can be promoted in accordance with the Yuxi Daily editorial "Stop Land Reform and Implement Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction."

　　D. Advocate eliminating bandits, opposing the Kuomintang reactionary forces, establishing democratic power, stabilizing social order, strictly implementing the three main rules of discipline and the eight points for attention, and protecting the people's lives and property. All those who do not oppose the People's Liberation Army and obey the laws of the democratic government shall be protected. Chiang's bandits and enemy personnel, except for those who have committed heinous crimes that must be punished, the rest of the coerced followers will be exempt from prosecution as long as they repent and reform themselves to the government, strictly enforce political integrity, be fair and just, save people's resources, reasonably share the burden, oppose theft and destruction, and reward agricultural and industrial production.

　　E. Publicize the various policies stipulated in the Central Plains Bureau's June 6th instructions, especially the policies on bandits, reasonable burden, protecting cities, protecting industry and commerce, and winning over intellectuals. Explain the relationship between each policy and the people's interests, advocate contacting the masses, improving work style, conducting investigation and research, being hardworking and simple, and seeking benefits for the people. Proceed from reality in everything, and oppose the arbitrary application of old experiences regardless of time and place. Outside cadres must unite with local cadres, learn from each other's strengths and overcome weaknesses, and oppose arrogance and the bad work style of relying solely on administrative orders. Attention must be paid to cultivating activists among the local masses, and at the same time, outside cadres should strive to take root among the masses.

　　F. Call on cadres to study the Party's line and policies, especially the policies for newly liberated cities and newly liberated areas, combine them with the local reality, resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's guidelines and policies and the Central Plains Bureau's June 6th instructions, oppose independence from the Party's policies, and oppose the state of disorganization and indiscipline in which the system is not implemented, so that cadres become more politically mature and the Communist Party becomes stronger.

　　In order to implement the above propaganda, all possible propaganda opportunities should be used to adopt various propaganda methods. For example: 1. Use the form of government announcements to publicly announce propositions and policies; 2. Use more oral propaganda, such as individual conversations, street speeches, disguised propaganda, dramas, singing, etc.; 3. Conference propaganda, various agencies and troops should regularly hold various symposiums and mass meetings, and make them a system; 4. Write slogans, slogans, leaflets, and publish bulletins and intelligence; 5. Publish newspapers and books, and use the New China Branch's news reports for propaganda; 6. Run various training classes and seminars, especially to hold symposiums and training classes for primary and secondary school teachers, etc., to absorb intellectuals to participate, publicize our propositions and policies to them, and spread them to the broad masses through them.

　　(3) In order to strengthen propaganda work, the Party committees and columns of each district should improve their propaganda departments, first of all, establish and enrich the organization of the New China Branch or sub-branch in the short term, equip necessary cadres with radio stations and printing equipment, so that they can at least copy the broadcasts of the New China General Agency, and maintain regular contact with the Central Plains General Branch. The original propaganda cadres should be persuaded and assigned to propaganda work positions as much as possible. At the same time, new intellectuals should be absorbed in various forms, and they should be trained in short-term politics to become propaganda workers. Leading organs should have special personnel to take care of propaganda work regularly. District Party committees and column Party committees should hold regular meetings to specifically discuss propaganda guidelines and propaganda work issues.

### 中共中原局宣传部　关于传宣工作的指示

　　中共中原局宣传部
  　关于传宣工作的指示
    【新华社中原二十六日电】中共中原中央局宣传部于八月十五日发出关于宣传工作的指示，原文如下：
    （一）过去时期宣传工作虽有若干成绩，但存在严重弱点，主要的是我们的宣传工作做得很不够，没有系统的与敌人进行思想斗争。在宣传党的主张政策上，有许多不正确的地方。对中原新区的社会情况、群众的生活和思想状态，和敌人的宣传活动，缺乏充分的调查研究，因而宣传内容往往不完全切合新区实际和群众要求。事实证明：由于新区长期受国民党的统治和影响，由于一般群众对我党我军和我们的主张政策不很了解，由于干部和战士进入新区以后思想情绪容易发生变化，也由于我们对新区许多事情不熟悉，需要很好研究与指导，宣传工作必须特别加强。应该教育全党全军，人人都成为宣传战士，随时随地进行宣传工作，结合当地的社会情况和群众生活，运用群众熟悉的事实材料，宣传目前形势和我们的主张政策，揭发和打击敌人的造谣欺骗，确立他们在新区群众的思想阵地，使群众从国民党的武断宣传的影响下解放出来。
    （二）我们根据最近中央指示和新华社社论以及中央局六六指示，规定如下一般的宣传要点，各地可以参照这个要点，根据当地的实际情况，规定自己更具体的宣传方针：
    甲、宣传蒋必败，我必胜，揭发美帝及中国反动集团的假和平阴谋，号召克服困难，争取人民解放战争的全国胜利。说明美蒋任何作战计划均告失败，全盘战略处于被动，蒋介石及其反动集团完全丧失人心，已到最后崩溃边缘。我进军中原，具有伟大意义，且已获得很大成就，中原的全部解放已为期不远。我们虽尚可能有暂时的局部的困难，不应在具体斗争中轻敌，但也决不可夸大困难，任何困难均可克服。我们向主和平，现在也愿赶快结束战争，内战是美蒋造成的，但今天美帝国主义的假和平的阴谋，只是企图使国民党获得喘息，重整兵力，卷土重来。不推翻国民党反动统治，不使美帝国主义侵略势力退出中国，中国就不会有真正的和平民主。美帝和各国反动派外强中干，是可以战胜的。美帝及其走狗蒋介石所发动的是反革命战争，我们反对美蒋，是人民解放战争，具有两种不同性质。只有人民解放战争胜利，中华民族和中国人民才能得到解放。新华社“人民解放战争两周年的总结和第三年的任务”的社论，应全部在群众中广泛并反复宣传。
    乙、分清敌我界限，打击敌人造谣欺骗，争取群众。共产党代表全国人民，解放军、民主政府是人民自己的军队和政府，以人民的意志为意志，为中国人民和中华民族而奋斗。我们的基本主张是：联合各阶层人民组成反美反蒋统一战线，推翻美帝及其走狗蒋介石的反动统治，成立民主联合政府。我们的一切政策、法令、措施，都是为人民谋利益的。国民党、国民党军队和国民党政府，是代表帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本的，他们的统治是少数军阀、官僚、大买办、大地主统治，对外出卖祖国，对内压迫人民。他们抓丁拉夫，征粮派款，敲诈掠夺，滥发纸币，贪污腐化，横行不法，一切为少数人利益而迫使大多数人民无法生活，解放区和国民党区是两个社会，两个制度，人民生活根本不同，国民党反动分子造谣诬蔑共产党和解放军；歪曲民主政府的政策法令，其目的在破坏人民自己的军队和政府，使人民不能翻身，继续受他们的统治和压迫。我们一定站得住，反动势力一定被打垮，天下一定是老百姓的。
    丙、宣传目前停止土改实行减租减息和合理负担的原因和理由。现在的减租减息是土地改革的第一步，是将来彻底改革土地制度的准备步骤。凡已实行土改的地方，保障农民既得利益，地主不应倒算，可照豫西日报社论“停止土改实行减租减息”宣传。
    丁、提倡肃清土匪，反对国民党反动势力，建立民主政权，安定社会秩序，严格执行三大纪律，八项注意，保护人民生命财产。凡不反对解放军并服从民主政府法令者，一律予以保护。蒋党土匪和敌方人员，除罪大恶极分子必须惩办者外，其余胁从分子，只要向政府悔过自新，一律免予追究，厉行政治廉洁公正，节省民力，合理负担，反对偷盗破坏，奖励农工生产。
    戊、宣传中原局六月六日指示所规定的各项政策，其中尤其是对土匪政策，合理负担政策，保护城市、保护工商业政策，和争取知识分子政策，说明每一政策与人民的利益关系，提倡联系群众，改进作风，调查研究，艰苦朴素，为民谋利。一切从实际出发，反对不问时间、地点任意套用老经验。外来干部必须和本地干部团结，互相取长补短，反对自高自大及专靠行政命令的坏作风。必须注意培养当地群众中的积极分子，同时外来干部应力求在群众中生根。
    己、号召干部学习党的路线政策，尤其是新解放城市和新解放地区的政策，结合当地实际，坚决贯彻党中央的方针政策和中原局六月六日指示，反对对于党的政策闹独立性，和不执行制度的无组织无纪律状态，使干部在政治上更加成熟，共产党更加强大。
    为贯彻上述宣传，应利用一切可能的宣传机会采取各种各样的宣传方法。例如：一、运用政府布告形式，公开宣布主张政策；二、多用口头宣传，如个别谈话，街头讲演，化装宣传，演剧、唱歌等；三、会议宣传，各机关部队均应经常召开各种座谈会和群众大会，并把他订为一种制度；四、书写标语、口号、传单、出刊捷报情报；五、出版报纸书籍，并利用新华分社新闻报道进行宣传；六、开办各种训练班、讲习所、尤其要举行中小学教员的座谈会和训练班等，吸收知识分子参加，向他们宣传我们的主张政策，通过他们传播到广大群众中去。
    （三）为了加强宣传工作，各区党委和纵队都应健全自己的宣传部门，首先在短期内把新华分社或支社的组织建立和充实起来，配备必要干部设置电台和印刷器材，做到至少能抄收新华总社的广播，并和中原总分社保持经常联络。原来的宣传干部，应尽量说服和分配他们到宣传工作岗位上来，同时应用各种形式吸收新的知识分子，经过短期政治训练，培养他们成为宣传工作人员。领导机关应有专人经常照顾宣传工作。区党委和纵队党委，应定期会议，专门讨论宣传方针和宣传工作问题。
