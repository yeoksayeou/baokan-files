Xinhua News Agency, North China, 29th: According to various sources: Under the continuous blows of our powerful People's Liberation Army, the Fu Zuoyi bandit gang has recently been forcibly levying huge sums from the people in Tianjin and other places to increase and repair city defense fortifications, attempting to prolong their lives. According to the Tianjin Yishi Daily on August 5th, "The various taxes and levies in Tianjin are heavy. The self-defense special donation, city defense fee, and horse feed fee that urgently need to be levied now have reached a staggering 13 trillion yuan. Averaged over the two million people in Tianjin (in reality, Tianjin only has 1.8 million people), each person has to bear an average of 6.5 million." The Tianjin Yishi Daily on August 8th reported: The collection method for the city defense fee has been drafted and is awaiting collection. "The method is divided into two parts: one is a direct collection method, collecting 1 trillion yuan, with payers divided into special households and ordinary households. Special households will pay a total of 600 billion, including 150 billion from large private enterprises, 120 billion from the banking industry, 50 billion from the import and export and shipping industries, etc. Ordinary households will pay a total of 400 billion, including 280 billion from merchants and 120 billion from residents in various districts. The other method is an indirect collection method, which is to add a "stamp duty" to checks and promissory notes, deducting 2 per mille of the face value." In addition to Tianjin, according to a Tianjin Dagongbao report on July 19th, the enemy troops guarding Tangshan in eastern Hebei also plan to build a new three-li long outer moat (36 feet wide and 18 feet deep) and repair the old moat, forcibly apportioning the project cost of "over 200 billion yuan, requiring it to be collected within ten days. Merchants and civilians, unable to bear the burden, plan to send representatives to Ping to petition the Suppression Headquarters."

　　天津唐山等地
  　傅匪搜刮巨额城防费
    【新华社华北二十九日电】综合各方消息：傅作义匪帮在我强大人民解放军不断打击下，近日正在天津等地强向人民摊派巨款，增修城防工事，企图苟延残喘。据八月五日天津益世报载称：“津市各项捐税重重，目前急待开征的自卫特捐、城防费和马料费，已达十三万亿元之巨。以津市二百万人口来平均计算（实际津市仅一百八十万人），每人平均要负担六百五十万”。八月八日津益世报载：城防费的征收办法，又已拟就待征，“该办法共分为两部，一为直接征集办法，征集一万亿元，纳费人分特户、普通户两种。特户总共纳六千亿，包括私人大企业一千五百亿、银钱业一千二百亿、进出口及轮船业五百亿等。普通户共纳四千亿，计商户共二千八百亿，各区住户共一千二百亿。另一个办法是间接征集办法，即在支票及本票上加以“贴证”，按票面抽千分之二”。除津市外，据津大公报七月十九日消息，冀东唐山守敌，亦因拟新建三华里长外壕一道（宽三丈六尺，深一丈八尺），及修理旧壕，强制摊派工程费“二千亿元以上，限十天内集齐。商民以无力负担，拟派代表赴平向剿总请愿”。
