Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Foreign news reports: The late General Feng Yuxiang bravely rejected the US imperialist conspiracy to undermine the Chinese people's democratic front and suffered joint oppression from Chinese and American reactionaries. Hong Kong's "Far East Newsletter" weekly published on the 11th of this month, Feng's letter to Mr. Li Jishen of Hong Kong on August 12th, stated that while Feng was residing in the United States, US government officials had indicated to him that as long as the anti-Chiang factions in China abandoned their united front with the Communist Party, the US government would "abandon Chiang Kai-shek" and support them with "sufficient money and military supplies." The US official gave them "six months to consider this matter," but Feng immediately replied, rejecting this despicable proposal. While implementing enticements, the American reactionaries also carried out threats against Feng. As Feng increasingly felt the deterioration of the environment in the United States, he was determined to return to the motherland to engage in effective struggle. Feng said in the above letter: The final departure was not without difficulties because the passport had expired. Feng condemned Chiang Kai-shek and the American reactionaries for attempting to subvert his plans; "They are in league with the villains Chute and Luce in Congress and scold me whenever they have the opportunity." Former US Secretary of the Interior Ickes wrote on the 8th of this month that Chiang Kai-shek, a dictator as cruel as Hitler or Mussolini, had sent his henchmen to pursue Feng with the apparent permission or even help of the US government. "Feng had reason to suspect that he was not safe here, so he quietly set off for another land; he hoped to find greater safety in that land to avoid possible assassination."

　　冯玉祥曾拒绝美帝诡计
    留美时遭中美反动派联合压迫
  　决心回祖国来从事有效的奋斗
    【新华社陕北十九日电】国外消息报导：已故的冯玉祥将军曾勇敢地拒绝了美帝国主义破坏中国人民民主阵线的诡计，并遭受了中美反动派的联合压迫。本月十一日香港“远东汇报”周刊刊载冯氏八月十二日致香港李济琛氏信称，冯氏留居美国时，美国政府官员曾向他表示，只要中国反蒋的派别抛弃与共产党联合的立场，美国政府便会“抛弃蒋介石”，而以“充足的金钱与军火”支持他们。该美国官员给他们“六个月时间考虑这事”，但冯氏立即作了答复，拒绝了这个卑鄙的提议。美国反动派在实行利诱的同时，向冯氏实行了威胁。冯氏在日益感觉到美国环境的恶劣时，决心回到祖国来从事有效的奋斗。冯氏在上述的信中说：最后的启程不是没有困难的，因为护照已满有效期。冯氏谴责蒋介石与美国反动派企图颠覆他的计划；“他们与国会里的恶棍楚德和鲁斯联成一气，一有可能就痛骂我”。前美国内政部长伊克斯于本月八日著文称：与希特勒或墨索里尼同样残酷的独裁者蒋介石，曾在美国官方显然的允许甚至帮助之下派遣他的鹰犬追逐冯氏。“冯氏有理由猜疑他在这里是不安全的，所以他悄悄地动身到另外一块土地上去；他希望能在那块土地上找到较大的安全，以免遭遇到可能的暗杀。”
