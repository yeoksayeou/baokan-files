Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: TASS reports: The Soviet Red Star newspaper recently published an article entitled "US Monopoly Capital and the Militarization of the United States," stating that US monopoly capital is deliberately creating a war crisis domestically in order to pursue new profits. One of the most prominent features of the United States today is the rise of new large companies producing war materials. American arms magnates, like Krupp in pre-defeat Germany, play a decisive role in American political and economic life. Many facts illustrate the close ties between US monopoly capital and major military groups. Secretary of Defense Forrestal, Undersecretary of the Army Draper, Undersecretary of the Air Force Whitney, and Undersecretary of the Navy Brown all previously held important positions in American banks and industries. At the same time, an increasing number of representatives of military factions are being selected to serve as leaders of monopoly capital groups. They are closely linked together. It is these figures who are promoting the new arms race and provoking new wars.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Various reports indicate that the profits of major US corporations have increased again compared to last year. Comparing the first half of this year with the first half of last year, the profits of Standard Oil of New Jersey rose from $134 million to $210 million, General Motors Corporation from $137 million to $206 million, and US Steel Corporation alone can earn an additional $180 million annually from steel price increases. One of the main reasons for this surge in profits is the expansion of government military spending and military orders, which has greatly increased the burden on the American people. According to a United Press report on the 5th, citing sources from the US Department of Defense, the US Army, Navy, and Air Force budget for the fiscal year 1949 (from July 1st of this year to June 30th of next year) totals $15.25 billion. This figure is more than $4 billion higher than what Truman proposed in January of this year, accounting for 36 percent of the total US budget expenditure. As a result, the military spending burden on the American people in peacetime has increased from an average of $8 per person in 1938 to an average of about $100 per person now. If the so-called "foreign aid expenses" are included, the burden on each American per year will be even more staggering. Furthermore, according to Truman's review on the 15th of last month of the congressional revisions to the fiscal year 1949 budget, the total expenditure of the US budget for this year has increased from $39.6 billion proposed in January to $42.2 billion, while the total revenue has been reduced from $44.4 billion to $40.7 billion, resulting in a deficit of $1.5 billion, which has to be made up from the previous year's surplus.

### 美独占资本家追逐新的利润　故意挑拨新战争

　　美独占资本家追逐新的利润
  　故意挑拨新战争
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社讯：苏联红星报最近于题为“美国独占资本与美国军国主义化”一文中宣称：美国独占资本为追逐新的利润，故意在国内制造战争危机。美国今日最突出的特征之一，就是生产战争物资的新的大公司的兴起。美国的军火大王如象德国战败前的克虏伯一样，在美国政治经济生活中起着决定性的作用。许多事实说明美国独占资本与主要军人集团间的密切联系。国防部长福莱斯特尔、陆军部次长德莱伯、空军部次长惠特尼、海军部次长布朗等人以前都曾在美国银行和工业中占有重要职位。同时军事派系的代表被选来充当独占资本团体领袖的人数，也越来越多。他们紧密地结合在一起。宣传新军备竞赛，挑拨新战争的正是这些人物。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】各方报导：美国各大公司的利润较诸去年又有新的增加。以今年上半年与去年上半年相比较，新泽西美孚油公司的利润从一亿三千四百万元升至二亿一千万元，通用汽车公司从一亿三千七百万元升至二亿零六百万元，美国钢公司则仅由钢产加价一项，每年即可多获利润一亿八千万元。这种利润激增的主要原因之一，就是由于政府军费与军事订货的膨胀所致，而这种军费的膨胀则大大加重了美国人民的负担。据合众社五日电引美国防部人士称：美国一九四九年度（自本年七月一日至明年六月卅日）的海陆空军预算共达一百五十二亿五千万元。这一数字较杜鲁门今年一月所提者增加了四十亿元以上，占美国预算总支出的百分之三十六。因此，美国人民和平时期的军费负担已自一九三八年的每人平均八元增至现在的每人平均一百元左右。若再计入所谓“援外费用”的支出，则美国每人每年的负担将更为惊人。又据杜鲁门上月十五日在检讨国会修正的四九年度预算时声称，美国本年度预算的总支出已自其一月份所提出的三百九十六亿元增至四百二十二亿元，而总收入则反自四百四十四亿元被削减至四百零七亿元，因而形成了十五亿元的赤字。不得不由上年度的盈余项下予以弥补。
