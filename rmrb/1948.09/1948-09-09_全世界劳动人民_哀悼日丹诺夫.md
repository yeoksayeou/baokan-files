Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Reports from various sources: Laboring people around the world are mourning the death of Zhdanov in unison. Communist parties and trade unions of various countries, as well as governments and parliaments of people's democracies, sent telegrams to the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party and the Soviet government to express their condolences upon hearing the sad news. Soviet embassies abroad have been receiving a steady stream of telegrams of condolence from the laboring people of their host countries. Democratic newspapers in various countries have published detailed news reports of Zhdanov's death in prominent positions, and have written articles of mourning. In the people's democracies of Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Albania, workers in factories have held memorial services. The Albanian government, upon receiving the sad news on the evening of the 31st, convened a special meeting at midnight and decided to order the nation to fly flags at half-mast until the deceased is buried. The Political Bureau of the Romanian Workers' Party held a meeting on the morning of the 1st, where Comrade Luca, the secretary of the Romanian Communist Party, reported on the life of the deceased. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, with two million members, flew flags at half-mast at the location of each of its organizations. The French Communist Party, represented by Thorez, and the Japanese Communist Party, represented by Nosaka Sanzo, sent telegrams to Stalin on behalf of their respective central committees to express their condolences. In addition, the People's Socialist Party of Cuba and the Communist Party of Uruguay, far away in South America, and even the Communist Party of Morocco in Africa, also sent telegrams of condolence. Democratic newspapers in Norway and Sweden wrote articles pointing out that the death of such an outstanding leader as Zhdanov is not only a most painful loss for the Soviet people, but also for the international workers' movement. The Italian Communist Party's newspaper, Unità, published an editorial calling: In memory of Comrade Zhdanov, we pledge to continue the struggle to defeat imperialism, which enslaves our country and provokes new world wars, with even greater efforts.
