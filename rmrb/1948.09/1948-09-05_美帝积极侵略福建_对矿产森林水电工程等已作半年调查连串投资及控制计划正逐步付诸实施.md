Xinhua News Agency, East China, 1st: According to the Fuzhou correspondence in the "Outlook" magazine, Volume 2, Issue 11, of Nanjing on August 17, US imperialism has been actively invading Fujian in the past half year. From October last year to April this year, Corden, an American engineer from the Kuomintang government's "Central Hydropower Generation Office," went to Gutian, northwest of Fuzhou, to investigate water conservancy. Durant, a representative of the American banking group, went to southern Fujian to investigate "construction projects." Zhou Zixing, the Chinese manager of the American "Jiangnan Construction Company," and the American engineer, Dunard, and others inspected the Gutian Creek hydropower project, the paper industry, the coal mines in Linsen and Shaowu counties in northern Fujian, the minerals in southwestern Fujian, and the Mawei port. Dai Jiege, an inspector of the American "China Relief Mission," went to Fuzhou, Zhangpu, Xiamen, and other places to inspect. The "Geological Survey Team" went to Jinjiang and the Jiulong River to survey the soil and geological conditions of the two river basins. Drillers from the American "Goodyear Company" went to Fujian to explore for lead mines. Even the American destroyer "Twolte" visited Fujian.

After this series of "inspections," the US plot to invade Fujian has been gradually implemented. The Jiangnan Construction Company has already invested in establishing the Gutian Creek power generation project, with the plant site located in Xunting. Once this project is completed, the economies of the surrounding thirteen counties, including Fuzhou, Linsen, Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Ningde, Pingnan, Jian'ou, Nanping, Youxi, Minqing, Changle, and Yongtai, will be controlled by it. It can also indirectly control the mining of Gutian ironsand and sulfide mines in Yongtai, Ningde, and other counties. It can also use electricity refrigeration to control the fisheries of Fujian Province.

In terms of the paper industry, Kuomintang bureaucratic capital has colluded with the Jiangnan Construction Company to select Mawei as the site for a paper mill, covering an area of 2,000 mu. All the farmers living in the area of the factory site and the rice seedlings they planted were forcibly cleared in early May, and construction began in July. Personnel have also been sent to Longyan and Yongchun in southern Fujian to prepare for the construction of paper mills. Fujian is one of the three major forest areas in the country, and the local handmade paper industry has always been developed. In the future, the original paper industry in the province will be squeezed by American capital and fall into despair.

In terms of minerals, the Jiangnan Construction Company is also preparing to invest in mining. The mining plans for coal mines in Longyan, Jian'ou, Chong'an, Liancheng, Yongtai, and other counties, as well as iron mines in Anxi, Shanghang, Hua'an, and other places, have been submitted to Washington for review. In addition, the company plans to build a railway from Xiamen to Longyan to facilitate its invasion.

　　美帝积极侵略福建
  　对矿产森林水电工程等已作半年调查连串投资及控制计划正逐步付诸实施
    【新华社华东一日电】据八月十七日南京“展望”杂志二卷十一期福州通讯披露：近半年来，美帝国主义积极侵略福建。去年十月至今年四月间，曾先后有国民党政府“中央水力发电处”美籍工程师柯登赴福州西北之古田考察水利，美国银行团代表杜朗至闽南调查“建设事业”，美商“江南建设公司”华籍经理周自兴及美籍工程师杜纳德等考察古田溪水电工程、制纸工业、闽北林森、邵武等县煤矿、闽西南矿产、及马尾港口等，美“援华救济团”视察戴杰恪赴福州、漳浦、厦门等地考察，“地质调查队”赴晋江及九龙江勘察两江流域土壤及地质情形，美国“固特异公司”钻探家至闽钻探铅矿，甚至美国驱逐舰“特窝尔特”号亦来闽访问。美国侵略福建的阴谋计划在这一连串的“视察”后，已逐步付诸实行。江南建设公司已投资建立古田溪发电工程，厂址设在循亭，这一工程完成后，其周围福州、林森、连江、罗源、宁德、屏南、建瓯、南平、尤溪、闽清、长乐、永泰等十三县经济都要受其控制，并可间接控制古用铁砂矿及永泰、宁德等县硫化矿的开采，另可利用电力冷藏控制闽省渔业。造纸业方面，国民党官僚资本已与江南建设公司相勾结，择定马尾设立造纸厂，占地两千亩，所有居住在厂址一带农民及其所种植的秧苗，五月上旬即被武力清除，七月间开始动工兴筑。并已派员至闽南龙岩、永春两地筹建造纸厂。福建为全国三大森林地带之一，当地手工造纸业一向发达，今后该省原有纸业势将遭受美国资本排剂而陷于绝境。矿产方面，江南建设公司亦准备投资开采，关于龙岩、建瓯、崇安、连城、永泰等县煤矿及安溪、上杭、华安等地铁矿的开采计划书，已送交华盛顿审核。此外，该公司并拟兴建厦门到龙岩的铁路，以便利其侵略。
