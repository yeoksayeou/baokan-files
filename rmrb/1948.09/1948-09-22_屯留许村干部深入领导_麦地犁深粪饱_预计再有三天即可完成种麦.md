　　Intensify Wheat Planting and Increase Grain Production
  　Tuntliu Xucun Cadres Deeply Lead
  　Wheat Fields Deeply Plowed and Manure Saturated
    Expected to Complete Wheat Planting in Three More Days
    [Taiyue Electric] Cadres in Xucun, the second district of Tuntliu, actively lead wheat planting. By September 5th, they had planted 800 mu of wheat, accounting for one-half of the village's wheat fields. After arranging wheat planting on August 14th, the cadres went deep into each group to lead wheat planting, and met once after dinner every day to exchange information and opinions, and used the radio station to commend the good and criticize the bad in a timely manner to promote wheat planting. Under such in-depth and timely leadership, all 21 small mutual aid groups, 210 male laborers, and 80 animals in the village went to the fields to plow and plant. More than 400 mu of the village's 1,225 mu of wheat fields were plowed four times, 550 mu were plowed three times, and the rest were plowed twice. Moreover, an average of 45 dan of manure was applied per mu. Miao Xian's first group applied 80 dan per mu on 130 mu of wheat. In order to give full play to the power of organization, fair methods of exchanging labor and wages were jointly stipulated within the mutual aid group. It was stipulated that animals plowing a day of land would receive 7 sheng of rice, and manual labor would receive 5 sheng. Sending manure and planting would count as two manual labor units for animals, and semi-labor was based on the amount of work. This was combined with participation in the war, and one labor unit for a combatant could be exchanged for one agricultural labor unit. Regarding substitute farming, Cui Daosheng, a committee member in charge of assisting the military, personally took charge during this wheat planting and planted the land for military families early. For example, Liu Junfa, a military family member, applied 50 dan of manure per mu to his 5 mu of wheat and plowed it three times, and it has now been planted. After arranging wheat planting on August 14th, the village had planted 800 mu of wheat by September 5th, and it is expected to complete wheat planting victoriously in three more days.
    [Taiyue Electric] Lianfang Village in Gaoping Pangcun continues to plant wheat on time under the leadership of party members and cadres. Because each village actively composted and created fertilizer in the previous stage, this time it was possible to achieve "deep plowing and saturated manure." Each village started planting on the 3rd. According to statistics from the four villages of Pucun, Zaili, Longqu, and Xiayujing, 30,004 mu of wheat have now been planted. Yan Jinwang of Xiayujing planted 6 mu of wheat and applied 120 carts of manure. Zhang Rui, a member of the Pucun Farmers' Association Standing Committee, planted 7 mu of wheat and applied more than 150 dan of thatch manure and 3,100 jin of Jinghao manure. Village Chief Han Mingshun planted 7 mu of wheat, and applied more than 100 dan of thatch manure alone, as well as slag manure and Jing fertilizer. In Zaili Village, 1,288 dan of green wormwood and 656 carts of slag manure were applied to 64 mu of wheat fields. At the same time, in order not to delay the autumn harvest and plant wheat in time, women were organized to participate, and a division of labor between men and women was implemented, striving to complete planting on the 12th or 13th, and wheat stubble wheat should also be planted in advance. The Women's Mutual Aid Group led by Tang Yinying harvested 5 mu of grain in one day. Yujing Village has harvested 74 mu of grain, 76 mu of sorghum, and also "moved" 36 mu of stubble.
　　Some Villages in Wenxin and Renhe
  　Actively Eliminate Wasteland and Plant Wheat
    [Jizhong Electric] Some villages in Wenxin and Renhe (both newly established counties) actively eliminate wasteland and plant wheat. Recently, Qianxu Gezhuang, Jiliukou, and other seven villages in the western part of the fifth district of Wenxin found more than 80 mu of wasteland. The reasons for the wasteland are: (1) When distributing land during the land reform, district cadres did not work in depth and did not clearly propose a solution for land entrusted to outside villages. For example, more than 20 mu of land belonging to the Chen family landlord in Wen'an city and more than 10 mu of land belonging to the Lu Yunfei landlord in Zougezhuang to the north of Xiangguanzhuang Village have not been distributed, and no one has planted them to this day. (2) The Farmers' Association did not properly manage or assign people to cultivate some of the land of famine-stricken households. For example, 30 mu of such land were found in Jiliukou. (3) Some village cadres engaged in localism, and during the land reform, they were afraid of transferring land to outside villages, so land on the outer boundaries (i.e., far from their own village and close to other villages) was not reported, but it was not planted either. For example, 20 mu of land were wasted in Xizhuang in this way. After discovering this wasteland, the district cadres immediately organized the masses to investigate the wasteland, and the district cadres personally led the cadres of each village to investigate the land. The wasteland that was found was distributed to a part of the poor village of Guanzhuang. Now the masses in the village are cutting the weeds in the field and preparing to plant wheat. There are still 330 mu of wasteland in Caicun, the tenth district of Renhe, of which 130 mu were not distributed during the land reform, mostly thin land or too far from the village, and no one cultivated them; 200 mu were distributed to landlords and rich peasants, mostly bad land, and they lacked farm tools and livestock, so they were barren. Recently, when Zhang Wu of the district committee inspected the production situation in the village, he found this wasteland and immediately convened a branch committee meeting, made a review, and discussed solutions. Branch Secretary Kong Zao proposed using wood from floating assets to exchange for some livestock, and then getting some farm tools to distribute to landlords and rich peasants who did not have or lacked livestock and farm tools, so that they could produce well and plant wheat. The land that was not distributed was also mobilized by the masses to be divided up and planted with wheat. The masses in the whole village agreed with this method. Now the village is also actively eliminating wasteland and preparing to plant wheat.

　　加紧种麦增产粮食
  　屯留许村干部深入领导
  　麦地犁深粪饱
    预计再有三天即可完成种麦
    【太岳电】屯留二区许村干部，积极领导种麦，至九月五日已种麦八百亩，占全村麦地二分之一。该村从八月十四日布置种麦后，各干部都深入到每个组内领导种麦，并在每日晚饭后接头一次，交换情况意见，利用广播台及时表扬好的，批评坏的，以推动种麦工作。在这样深入及时领导之下，全村二十一个小型互助组，二百一十个男劳动力，八十头牲口全部下地犁地下种。全村一千二百二十五亩麦地，有四百多亩就犁了四遍，五百五十亩犁了三遍，其余犁过两遍。而且每亩平均上粪四十五担，苗先一组一百三十亩麦，每亩担上八十来担。因为要发挥组织起来的力量，又在互助组内共同规定了公道的变工方法与工资。规定牲口犁一天地七升米，人工五升，送粪下种牲口一工顶两个人工，半劳力是按活计工，并与参战结合，打战人一工可以换农业劳动一工。对代耕方面，抗勤委员崔道生，在这次种麦时亲自掌握，把军属的地早早种上。如军属刘均法的五亩麦，每亩上了五十担粪，犁了三遍，现在已种上。该村从八月十四日布置种麦后，到九月五日就已种麦八百亩，预计再有三天就可胜利完成种麦工作。
    【太岳电】高平庞村联防村，继续在党员干部带领下，按时种麦。由于在前一阶段各村积极沤粪造肥，所以这次能作到了“犁深粪饱”。各村从三日起开始下种，据朴村、宰李、龙渠、下玉井四村统计，现已种麦三万零四亩。下玉井阎金旺种麦六亩，上粪一百二十车。朴村农会常委张瑞则种麦七亩，上茅粪一百五十余担，荆蒿粪三千一百斤，村长韩明顺种麦七亩，光茅粪就上了一百余担，还有渣粪、荆肥。宰李村六十四亩麦地，就上青蒿一千二百八十八担，上渣粪六百五十六车；同时为了不误收秋，回茬种麦，又组织妇女参加，实行男女分工，争取在十二、三日种完，老麦茬麦也要提前种上。妇女互助组唐银英领导六个妇女，一天就割谷五亩。玉井村已割谷七十四亩，割黍子七十六亩，还“搬”了三十六亩茬。
　　文新任河有些村
  　积极灭荒种麦
    【冀中电】文新、任河（均新设县）有些村庄积极灭荒种麦。文新五区西部前许各庄、急流口等七个村最近查出荒地八十余亩。荒地的原因是：（一）土改中分配土地时，区干部工作不深入，未明确提出外寄庄地的处理办法。如向官庄村北便有文安城里陈家地主的二十余亩，邹各庄地主卢云飞的地十余亩未分配，到现在也没人种。（二）一部分逃荒户土地，农会没很好代管或派人耕种。如急流口就查出这样的地三十亩。（三）有的村干部闹本位，土改中怕往外村调剂土地，在外边界（即距本村很远、距别的村很近的）的地没有报上，但也没有种上。如西庄就这样荒了二十余亩。区干部发现这些荒地后，立即组织群众查荒，区干部并亲自带着各村干部到地里去查。将查出的荒地分配给穷村官庄一部。现该村群众正在割地里的荒草，准备种麦。任河十区蔡村现在还有三百三十亩荒地，其中一百三十亩是土改中没分配下去，多是薄地，或离村太远，没人耕种；有二百亩是分给地主富农的，多是坏地，他们缺少农具、牲口，因而荒芜。最近区委张晤到该村检查生产情况时，查出这些荒地后，立即召开了支委会，做了检讨，商量了处理办法。支书孔造提议用浮财里的木料换几个牲口，再弄一部分农具，分给没有或缺少牲口农具的地主富农，让他们好好生产，种上麦子。没分配的地，也动员群众分了，种上麦子。这个办法，全村群众都很同意。现该村也在积极灭荒，准备种麦。
