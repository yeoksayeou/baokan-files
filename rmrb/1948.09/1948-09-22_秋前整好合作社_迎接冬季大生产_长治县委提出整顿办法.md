(Editor's Note: The Changzhi rectification methods for cooperatives still lack specific and clear solutions to the current major problems of cooperatives and issues regarding business operation guidelines. Although this may solve some problems, it may still be difficult to achieve thorough rectification. We hope the Changzhi County Committee will conduct another in-depth inspection and formulate more specific and comprehensive improvement measures.)

[Taihang News] The Changzhi County Committee has examined and researched the situation of cooperatives in the county and decided to vigorously rectify them, requiring completion before autumn to welcome winter production. The County Committee Secretary made a special report on the methods and steps of rectification at the expanded cadre meeting of the county district on the 24th of last month. The main points are as follows:

The current situation of cooperatives in Changzhi can be roughly divided into three types: one is those that have been rectified, one is those that are starting to be rectified, and one is those that are half-dead and have not been rectified. The reasons why cooperatives are currently half-dead or even collapsing are as follows: First, the foundation is not solid enough. Most or all of the county's cooperatives were established using the fruits of struggle, without determining the masses' share capital. The masses are not very concerned, and they take things from the cooperatives at will, considering them to be public property. Second, the cooperatives themselves have no rules. There are no rules for personnel establishment, share subscription and withdrawal, profit distribution, and treatment of miscellaneous staff, leading to chaos in the cooperatives. Managers have no power, cadres are unwilling to work, and loans are taken and not repaid, and debts are not repaid. As one district cooperative director said, "The cooperative has become a relief center for the masses and a supply department for the village public office." Third, there is blindness in operation, without organization or planning. There are as many as ten units in one village, including general cooperatives, branches, sub-branches, and small cooperatives, resulting in them all being unable to sell. There are too many people, high expenses, and they are eaten to death. Some engage in speculative buying and selling, resulting in losses that cannot be resolved. Fourth, there has been no clear policy for a long time, with a purely profit-seeking viewpoint. The relationship between county, district, and village cooperatives is not clear enough. They swallow and merge each other, resulting in collapse. Fifth, leadership from the county to the village has not paid enough attention to the cooperatives.

Based on these situations, the following rectification methods are proposed: (1) Settle accounts and distribute profits, discuss democratically, and resolve specific issues. First, resolve the issue of treatment for miscellaneous staff, using a profit-sharing system or a wage system. It is necessary to calculate whether it can match the benefits they would receive at home, and strictly overcome the phenomenon of working for free. In addition, during the account settlement and profit distribution period, a certain amount of profit should be set aside as a bonus for miscellaneous staff. (2) Clear internal and external debts, and overcome the relief viewpoint. Explain that the relief viewpoint in production is destructive to production and reactionary. Do not sacrifice the interests of the majority to cater to the interests of a few, and organize production for repayment. (3) Clearly determine share capital. All share capital that was not determined by the fruits of struggle should be distributed to the masses or, with the voluntary participation of the masses, to determine shareholders and distribute shares. (4) The shareholders' meeting should formally elect a board of directors to supervise the work of the cooperative and establish certain rules. (5) Determine the business direction based on the specific conditions of the village, grasping the principles of organizing production, promoting the sale of local specialties, and selling back the things needed by the village, especially the things needed for production, and strictly overcome the purely profit-seeking viewpoint and speculative buying and selling. (6) Party committees at all levels should pay attention to the leadership of cooperatives and regularly study cooperative work. It is required to complete the rectification before autumn, and in conjunction with the Farmers' Association, formulate a winter production plan and a spring plowing preparation plan for next year.

　　秋前整好合作社
  　迎接冬季大生产
  　长治县委提出整顿办法
    （编者按：长治关于合作社的整顿办法中，对当前合作社存在的主要问题，业务经营方针问题，解决得仍不够具体明确，这样虽解决部分问题，恐仍难达彻底整顿之目的。希长治县委再次深入检查，定出更具体周详的改进办法来。）
    【太行讯】长治县委会检查研究了本县合作社的情况，决定大力整顿，要求秋前整完，迎接冬季生产。县委书记在上月廿四日的县区扩大干部会议上关于整顿的方法与步骤，专门作了报告。要点如下：
    长治现在的合作社情况，大体有三种：一种是已经整顿好的，一种是开始在整顿的，一种是半死不活尚未整顿的。当前合作社半死不活甚至垮台的原因，有以下几种：一、基础不够巩固。全县合作社大部或全部都是用斗争果实成立起来的，没确定群众的股金，群众不大关心，在合作社随便乱取东西，认为是公家的。二、合作社本身没有制度。人员编制、入股抽股、分红、干杂人员待遇等没制度，形成合作社的混乱。经理没有权，干部不愿干，随便借钱不还，赊帐不还。正如一个区联社长说：“合作社成了群众的救济所，村公所的供给部”。三、经营上的盲目性，无组织无计划，有一个村多到十数个单位的，有总社、分社、支社、小型社等单位，结果都卖不了。人员多，开支大，吃垮了。有的买空卖空，结果赔了钱无法解决。四、长期没有明确的方针，单纯营利观点。县区村合作社关系上不够明确，你吞我并，结果垮台。五、由县到村对合作社领导上注意不够。
    根据这些情况，提出整顿办法：（一）结帐分红，民主讨论，具体解决，首先解决干杂人员待遇问题，用分红制度或工资制度，要计算一下能顶住他在家所得到的利益，严格克服白服务的现象。另外在结帐分红期，抽出一定红利作为干杂人员奖励金。（二）清理内欠和外欠，要克服救济观点，说明在生产中的救济观点是破坏生产的，反动的，不要照顾了少数人利益，损害了大多数人利益，组织生产归还。（三）明确确定股金。凡是用斗争果实没确定的股金，应分给群众或经群众自愿来确定股东分配股票。（四）由社员大会正式选举董事会，负起监督合作社的工作，并规定一定的制度。（五）根据本村具体情况来确定业务方针，掌握原则。组织生产，推销本村特产，贩回本村需要的东西，特别是生产上需要的东西，严格克服单纯营利观点，及买空卖空现象。六、各级党委要注意对合作社的领导，定期专门研究合作社工作。要求秋前整顿完毕，结合农会定出冬季生产计划及明年春耕准备计划。
