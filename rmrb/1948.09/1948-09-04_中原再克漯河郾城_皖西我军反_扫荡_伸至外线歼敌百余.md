Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 31st: A certain unit of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army, on the afternoon of August 23rd, once again recovered the important towns of Luohe and Yancheng on the Pinghan Railway. A part of the defending enemy was eliminated, and the majority fled south.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 30th: After the Anhui-West People's Liberation Army annihilated the majority of the Third Regiment of the Anhui Provincial Constabulary south of Shucheng on the 1st of this month, the Eighth Pacification Zone of the Kuomintang immediately gathered three regiments of its 48th Division, two battalions of the 46th Division, and a part of the Anhui Provincial Security Regiment, and on the 9th launched a large-scale intrusion into the area between Yuexi, Huoshan, Shucheng, and Tongcheng, attempting to carry out retaliatory joint "sweeping up" operations. Our army maneuvered to strike the enemy, and in coordination with friendly neighboring forces, counterattacked the enemy, forcing the entire enemy to flee back to their original defenses in a panic by the 12th, completely shattering their "sweeping up." Our army in outlying areas again defeated parts of the local Kuomintang army at Yexi (southwest of Yuexi), Shenjiaqiao (east of Shucheng), and Zhongmei River (southwest of Shucheng) on the 12th and 13th, killing or capturing over sixty of them. On the 16th, two battalions of the enemy's 46th Division again invaded eastward from Zaotan Factory (southeast of Huoshan) and were ambushed by our forces, resulting in over a hundred enemy casualties.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 31st: A certain unit of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army, on August 21st, raided the enemy stronghold of Jiuzhen Temple north of Tianmen in one fell swoop, annihilating the 14th Company of the Tianmen County Security Force, killing the enemy company commander Xie Guangqin and seven others, and capturing twenty-nine enemies. On the 22nd, the 80th Brigade of the enemy's 28th Division, with one battalion in coordination with two local Chiang Kai-shek companies, invaded the Jiuzhen Temple area from the north of Tianmen, and was completely crushed by another unit of our People's Liberation Army. Twelve enemies below the platoon leader level were killed, and thirty were captured alive, including the company commander. The above two battles resulted in the capture of one mortar, one 60mm mortar, two light machine guns, four submachine guns, and fifty-nine rifles. We suffered no casualties.
