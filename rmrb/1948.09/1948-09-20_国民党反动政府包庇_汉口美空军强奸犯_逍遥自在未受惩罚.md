Xinhua News Agency, North China, 16th: According to the Tianjin Yishi Daily News on August 20th and 23rd, after the atrocities committed by U.S. Air Force personnel in Hankou on August 8th, who collectively raped Chinese women, aroused public outrage among the citizens of Hankou. However, under the shelter and cover of the Kuomintang government, the U.S. military rapists are still at large and have not been punished in any way. The newspaper stated: "The dance party rape case has been widely discussed, and public opinion is also dissatisfied with the municipal government. Several American airmen who participated in the dance are still lingering in Hankou frankly." The newspaper pointed out: The reason why the U.S. military rapists are at large is because the Kuomintang "central authorities are unwilling to expand" the matter. The newspaper stated: "An investigation revealed that forty women were raped (according to the newspaper's previous report, there were more than twenty), including five wives of high-ranking military officers."

    【新华社华北十六日电】据八月二十、二十三日天津益世报消息，八月八日汉口美国空军人员，集体强奸中国妇女兽行发生后，激起汉口市民公愤，惟在国民党政府包庇掩护下，美军强奸犯仍逍遥自在，未受任何惩罚。该报称：“舞会强奸案街谈巷议已久，舆论亦对市府表示不满。有几个参加舞会的洋空军，仍坦然流连汉市。”该报指出：美军强奸犯逍遥自在的原因系由于国民党“中央方面不愿扩大”。该报称：“被奸妇女经调查为四十人（按该报前报导为二十余人），内有高级军事首长夫人五人。”
