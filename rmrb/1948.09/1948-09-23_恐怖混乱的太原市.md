　　The Terrifying and Chaotic Taiyuan City
　　Ma Ming
　　In the past month, under the mighty victory of the People's Liberation Army in the Jinzhong Campaign, the Yan bandit, entrenched in the isolated city of Taiyuan, is filled with panic and despair. As the People's Liberation Army approached the suburbs, and the sound of cannons shook the city, high-ranking officials and their families scrambled to "fly" to Peiping and Tianjin to escape. Fearing that our army would attack the city, they forced the masses in Chenjia Yu, Yangjia Yu, and other villages in the east of the city to crawl on the ground day and night, listening for any sounds of tunneling. The entire city was placed under martial law with increased sentry posts. Police, security, and secret agents roamed the streets. Anyone entering the city needed to find two lieutenant colonels to vouch for them or hold a certificate from the city defense headquarters. At night, the street lights were dim and sparse, and people were fearful, as if in a dead city. Staff members of the Pacification Headquarters were restless day and night, losing confidence in the city wall fortifications: "All this busywork is in vain!"
　　In order to save this last nest, the Yan bandits have been plundering goods and property on a large scale and strengthening their "defenses." All civilian materials that could be used for construction or weapon manufacturing, such as stones, bricks, tiles, wood, steel, iron, and machinery, are being "requisitioned" or "borrowed." They forcibly seized citizens to rush to build an airport in the northwest corner of the city, frantically declaring that they would not hesitate to demolish more than 720 civilian houses. After being opposed by the citizens, they stopped halfway and changed to building it outside the South Gate. Fearing that the civilian houses and autumn crops inside and outside Zhengtail Street and Qifeng Street outside the new South Gate would be used by our army for attacking the city, the bandit army hurriedly demolished and harvested all civilian houses and autumn crops within forty meters. At the same time, they ordered all students, clerical staff, and citizens aged sixteen to thirty-seven to be organized into "Student Divisions," "Clerical Staff Divisions," and "Civilian Defense Forces," respectively. Workers were organized into groups of three, and those of appropriate age were extracted to form "Worker Divisions," with the vacancies being filled by young women. More than 300 women were organized into "Armed Self-Defense Teams," all of whom were issued firearms and military uniforms, forcing them to die for the Yan bandits. In particular, the three massacres directed by the special agent chief Liang Huaizhi last month are unforgettable for the citizens. More than 130 innocent citizens and workers who were arrested by the "Special Police and Security Command" (Liang was the director) were falsely accused of "disguise" and were brutally buried alive or shot outside Hanximen, Xinnanmen, and Xiaodongmen.
　　Under the Yan bandits' massacres, plunder, demolition of houses, and soaring prices, the vast majority of citizens have fallen into a desperate situation of hunger, terror, and homelessness. They dare not look up when speaking (fearing being accused of "disguise"), and dare not walk close to the wall (fearing being accused of posting slogans for the Eighth Route Army). Currently, those who can swallow "Pingjing flour" (actually bran flour), bean cakes, and bitter herbs have become the middle class. Citizens whose houses were demolished on Zhengtail Street and Qifeng Street are living in makeshift shelters by the roadside, weeping under the rain, and there are many beggars and disabled people cast out by the Yan bandits wandering the streets. Robberies are constantly occurring at food stalls on the streets. Cases of jumping into wells, hanging, and taking poison are frequently heard. After a wealthy family near the Lüzu Temple was looted, seeing that they had no means of living, the woman sewed the only remaining gold ring into her child's clothes and committed suicide by taking poison while the child was out. Not only that, but the citizens are still forced to engage in indefinite "voluntary labor" while hungry. Last year alone, the labor "requisitioned" amounted to 607,700 workdays. No one knows how many adults starved to death or infants miscarried during the construction and in the rubble. Even the Yan bandits' middle and lower-ranking officials have suffered from hunger since the "family rations" were stopped.
　　The Yan army issues only two liang of flour per day, and the soldiers are constantly suffering from famine. Military morale is wavering, and desertion is rampant. According to the registration at one of our reception stations in a certain area alone, there are already more than 200 people. The defeated bandits, shrinking in the suburbs, rob and kill residents everywhere. Most of the villages in the eastern and southern suburbs have been looted several times. In Xiaojingyu, Jiajie, and Xiazhuang alone, eight people, including village chiefs and secretaries Wen Benhe, have been killed.
　　The people inside and outside Taiyuan, who are in deep water and scorching fire, can no longer live. Although the Yan bandits frantically shouted at the "Defend Taiyuan" mobilization meeting, "We must annihilate the Communist army under the city of Taiyuan," the citizens firmly believe, "Yan Xishan is finished. He only loses and never gains. Taiyuan cannot be defended either." The villagers in the suburbs are crying and telling about the Yan bandits' crimes and anxiously asking everywhere, "When will the city be attacked?" They place all their hopes on the early liberation by the People's Liberation Army.

　　恐怖混乱的太原市
    马明
    一月来，在解放军晋中胜利威震下，困踞太原孤城之阎匪，充满慌乱和悲观绝望。当解放军逼近城郊，炮声震撼市内外时，高级官员家眷争抢“飞”往平、津逃命。唯恐我军攻城，迫令城东陈家峪、杨家峪等村群众昼夜爬伏地下，听取有无挖地道声音。全市戒严增设岗哨，街上警宪特务横行，任何人进城，需找两个中校保或者持有城防司令部证明。入夜则路旁电灯暗淡稀疏，人心惶恐，有如死城。绥署参谋人员日夜坐卧不安，对城垣工事丧失信心：“白忙一起，徒劳无功”！
    阎贼为挽救这座最后巢穴，大肆掠夺商品财物和加强“防务”。凡民间一切可供作工事、武器制造的石头、砖、瓦、木材、钢、铁、机器等均在“征用”“征借”之列。强抓市民在城内西北角赶修飞机场，狂叫不惜拆毁民房七百二十余处，遭到市民反对后，始中途停止改到南门外修筑。匪军又唯恐新南门内外正太街、起凤街之民房秋禾为我军攻城所利用，竟急忙将四十公尺以内之民房秋禾悉数拆光割尽。同时勒令凡年在十六岁至三十七岁的学生、机关杂务人员及市民均分别编为“学生师”、“杂务人员师”、“民卫军”。工人则三人编一组，适龄者抽出编为“工人师”，遗缺迫使青年妇女补充。三百余妇女被编“武装自卫队”，一律发以枪械军装，迫使为阎贼送命。尤其上月特务头子梁化之一手导演的三次大屠杀，更为市民永远不能忘记，先后被“特种警宪指挥处”（按梁任处长）逮捕之一百三十余无辜市民、工人，被诬加“伪装”罪名，在旱西门、新南门、小东门以外惨遭活埋枪杀。
    广大市民阶层在阎匪屠杀、掠夺、拆房加以物价狂涨下，普遍陷入饥饿、恐怖和无房无衣的绝境，说话不敢抬头（怕说成“伪装”），走路不敢靠墙（怕说成给八路军写贴标语），目前能吞食“平经面粉”（实则糠面）豆饼和苦菜者已成中产阶级了。正太街、起凤街被拆毁住房的市民，群给含泪露宿于马路旁席棚阴雨下叫苦连天，流浪街头的乞丐及阎匪赶出残废人员甚多。大街食摊上不断发生争抢事件。跳井、悬梁、服毒自杀者时有所闻。吕祖庙附近某富家被掠夺精光后眼看生活无着，其女人将仅余之金戒指缝入小孩衣服，乘小孩外出服毒自杀。不仅如此，市民们饿着肚子仍被迫从事无期限的“义务劳动”。仅去年作工即“征用”六十万七千七百个工。不知多少大人饿死或婴儿小产在作工事和乱石中，就连阎贼的中小官员们自停发“眷粮”以后，亦饱尝饥饿之苦。
    阎军每日发斤二两面，士兵整日闹饥荒，军心动摇，逃风日甚，仅我某地一处招待所登记者，已有二百余人。龟缩于市郊溃匪，四出抢劫，抓杀居民，东、南市郊各村大部被洗劫数次，仅小井峪、嘉节、下庄等数村，即杀死村长书记温本和等八人。
    处于水深火热中的太原市内外老百姓，已再无法生活下去，尽管阎贼在“保卫太原”动员会上狂叫：“要消灭共军于太原城下。”但市民们却坚信：“阎锡山完啦，只见丢不见收，太原也保不住。”城郊老百姓则纷纷哭诉阎匪罪行并着急的到处打问：“什么时候攻城？”他们把一切希望寄托在解放军早日解救他们。
