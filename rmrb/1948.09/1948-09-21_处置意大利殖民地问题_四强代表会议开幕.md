Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 17th: TASS reports: The Four-Power Representatives Conference on the disposition of Italian colonies opened in Paris on the 13th. Attending the meeting were Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas, British Minister of State McNeil, and French Foreign Minister Schuman. Western countries attempted to portray this conference as a meeting of foreign ministers. Vyshinsky delivered a speech strongly refuting this, pointing out that the conference was not a meeting of foreign ministers. Vyshinsky stated that, according to the Italian peace treaty, the foreign ministers' conference should consider the recommendations after the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference had submitted them. However, the U.S. government violated the treaty by refusing to send the Secretary of State to participate in the meeting, and the British government adopted the same attitude, making it impossible for the foreign ministers' conference to discuss this issue. After pointing out that the timing of the conference was also deliberately delayed, Vyshinsky stated: "If the British and French representatives also agree, the Soviet Union will not oppose this Four-Power Representatives Conference on the Italian colonial issue."

　　处置意大利殖民地问题
  　四强代表会议开幕
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社报导：关于处置意大利殖民地问题的四强代表会议已于十三日在巴黎开幕，出席会议的有苏联外交部副部长维辛斯基、美国驻英大使道格拉斯、英国国务大臣麦克奈尔和法国外长舒曼。西方国家企图将这次会议说成是外长会议，维辛斯基发表演说予以强有力的驳斥，指明这次会议不是外长会议。维辛斯基称：按照对意和约规定，在四强外长代表会议提出建议以后，外长会议即应考虑这些建议。但美国政府却违背和约规定，拒绝派遣国务卿参加会议，英国政府也采取了同样的态度，使外长会议对这一问题的讨论成为不可能。在指出召集会议的时间也被故意拖延以后，维辛斯基称：“如果英法两国代表也同意，苏联将不反对这个四强关于意大利殖民地问题的代表会议。”
