The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region New Democratic Youth League Preparatory Committee recently issued instructions that mobilizing young people to actively participate in the autumn and winter work of land adjustment, determination of land rights, rectification of rural branches, and autumn and winter production, and establishing and improving youth work in these tasks, is the main task of the region's current youth work. The instructions of the committee include the following three aspects:

    First, in the adjustment of land, the issuance of land certificates, and the development of rural democratic movements, it is necessary to break the old method of limiting the target of mass work only to parents, and to promote the advantages of young people's simplicity, straightforwardness, courage to reflect the true situation, and courage to put forward opinions to others. They should be absorbed to participate in land registration, writing calculations, and other work. In organizing winter production and preparing for next year's spring plowing, all young people and children should be mobilized to participate in manure accumulation, fuel preparation, and various sideline productions within their capabilities, in order to facilitate the upsurge of the entire rural production movement. Where conditions permit, night schools, literacy groups, reading groups, etc. should be organized as much as possible during leisure time to improve the culture of young people and children and promote healthy recreational activities. In these activities, they should be organized according to the various forms they are willing to take, their ideological awareness should be raised, and activists should be cultivated to lay a better foundation for future youth work.

    Second, in areas where the Youth League has been established, League members should first be mobilized to play an exemplary role in doing a good job in mobilizing the youth; at the same time, in view of the fact that the majority of local League branches are not yet sound, they should be rectified in coordination with the Party rectification movement. The methods are: 1. Replenish the necessary number of district and county-level youth work cadres, give them specific help, and improve their work ability. 2. Improve the League branch committee, elect good League members to the committee; recruit a group of new League members from among the new youth activists; educate and transform some League members with poor conditions or bad work styles. 3. Coordinate with the current central work and, according to the demands of the youth, establish regular work activities for the Youth League. In the work of establishing the League, it is necessary to base it on the youth's consciousness and voluntariness, prevent forced orders and formalism such as copying rosters; and it is necessary to focus on and plan to select areas with relatively dense populations and more young people to establish the League.

    Third, in the autumn and winter land adjustment and other work, youth cadres must obey the unified allocation of the Party and closely combine with the entire work steps of the local Party to avoid being out of touch with the entire work activities. To this end, it is recommended that Party committees at all levels strengthen their leadership over youth work and help district or county youth cadres formulate specific work plans and implementation steps and methods for improving the Youth League; youth cadres should be used as centrally as possible to facilitate doing a good job in typical districts and townships, summarizing experience, and promoting general work.

　　陕甘宁新青团筹委会指示
  　发动青年参加秋冬工作
    【新华社西北二十二日电】发动青年群众积极参加秋冬两季之调剂土地、确定地权、整顿农村支部及进行秋冬生产等工作，并在这些工作中建立和健全青年工作，这是最近陕甘宁边区新民主主义青年团筹委会所指示的该区目前青年工作的主要任务。该会的指示包括以下三个方面：
    一、在调剂土地、发土地证及开展农村民主运动中，必须打破过去不少地区把群众工作对象只限于家长的旧办法，发扬青年纯朴直爽，勇于反映真实情况和勇于向别人提出意见的优点，吸收他们参加登记土地写算等工作。在组织冬季生产和准备明年春耕工作上，应发动所有青年儿童参加积肥和准备燃料以及各种力所能及的副业生产，以有利于掀起整个农村生产运动的热潮。在条件许可的地方，还要尽可能利用闲暇时间，组织夜校、识字组、读报组等，提高青年、儿童的文化，提倡正当的娱乐活动。在这些活动中，依据他们所愿意采取的各种形式组织起来，提高其思想觉悟，培养积极分子，给今后青年工作打下更好的基础。
    二、在已建立青年团的地区应首先发动团员起模范带头作用，做好发动青年群众的工作；同时鉴于大多数地方团的支部尚不健全，应在配合整党运动中予以整顿。办法是：一、充实必要数量的分区和县级青年工作干部，级予具体帮助，提高其工作能力。二、健全团的支部委员会，选举好的团员到委员会中去；在新的青年积极分子中吸收一批新团员；教育改造一些条件较差或作风不好的团员。三、配合当前中心工作，并依据青年群众的要求，建立起青年团的经常工作活动。在建团工作中，必须根据青年的自觉自愿，防止抄名册等强迫命令和形式主义；要有重点、有计划的选择人口比较稠密，青年较多的地区建立。
    三、在秋冬两季调剂土地等工作中，青年干部必须服从党的统一分配，与当地党的整个工作步骤密切结合，避免与整个工作活动脱节。为此建议各地党委加强对青年工作的领导，并帮助分区或县的青年干部，制订改善青年团的具体工作计划和实行的步骤、方法；尽可能比较集中地使用青年干部，以便于能做好典型区、乡，总结经验，推动一般。
