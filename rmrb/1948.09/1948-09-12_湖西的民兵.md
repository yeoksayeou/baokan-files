The Militia of Huxi

In every county of Huxi, one can see militiamen carrying big-cap rifles, machine guns, Thompson submachine guns seized from the Chiang bandits; some militiamen even carry captured Chiang army small cannons and hold Mauser pistols. They are all emancipated peasants who, through guerrilla warfare, have become as brave and tenacious as soldiers of the regular army in protecting the masses and their own interests. One company of the 96th Brigade of the enemy's 5th Army, in coordination with two companies of local bandits, went to the eighth district of Chengwu to seize grain. Twenty militiamen in the eighth district stretched out a battle line twenty miles wide to fire their guns, confusing the enemy and holding them back for two hours, preventing the three companies of enemies from advancing. The common people took advantage of this time to hide their belongings and themselves. The large force of Chiang bandits stationed in Chengwu was constantly disturbed by the sound of gunfire from the militia every night, leaving them in a state of panic and unable to sleep. Sometimes, a single militiaman would go near the enemy's garrison to shoot, disrupting and capturing scattered bandit soldiers. Once, two large columns of enemy troops passed through Chengwu. Between each company was a Chiang soldier riding a rickshaw. A militiaman hiding in the sorghum field would rush out, knock the rickshaw over, and ride off. When the enemy army was laying telephone lines, the militiamen would follow and cut them. In the first half of this year alone, the Chengwu militia, in coordination with cadres, cut more than 500 catties of telephone wire. The militia around Kaoshan Wanggang also constantly used machine guns and small cannons to drive away or kill and wound enemies attempting to plunder. They have made many contributions and produced many heroes. Night combat is the most proficient skill of the militia in the Dandong area. They can defeat large enemy forces with a small number of armed men. The militia of Dandong × Village had only five guns after the wheat harvest. At night, they were on guard on the roofs of houses when they suddenly heard movement in the sorghum field. It turned out to be more than 300 Chiang bandits preparing to attack the village. The militiamen discovered them and shouted loudly, "What are you doing in the sorghum field?" The noise in the sorghum field stopped, but no one answered. The militiamen fired a shot at the place where the noise had come from. The enemy knew they had been discovered and fired machine guns and cannons at the militiamen from all directions. Six machine guns were aimed directly at the militiamen's courtyard. The brave militiamen calmly returned fire while shouting, "First Battalion, attack from both sides! Second Battalion, Third..." The enemy could not figure out the situation, and only fired guns without daring to advance. Soon, militiamen from other villages came to support. The militiamen shouted, "The First Battalion is coming up from the south!" The Chiang bandits were so frightened that they fled in panic. Another time, three militiamen from × Village were patrolling at night when they reached a ditch in front of the village. They squatted down and looked east, vaguely seeing a dark mass of people in the distance. They spread out, one to the south and one to the north. The group of people got closer and closer, and in the starlight, they could see that they were Chiang bandits coming to plunder. The three militiamen fired their guns simultaneously from three directions. The unprepared Chiang bandits turned around and ran. The three militiamen did not shout, but simply chased after them, driving more than sixty fleeing soldiers for more than a mile. This spring, gunshots could be heard almost every night in Dandong and other places. Some were driving away Chiang bandits, others were killing or wounding enemies.

　　湖西的民兵
    在湖西的每个县里，都会看到民兵们从蒋匪手里夺来的大盖枪、机枪、汤姆式，甚至有的民兵扛着缴获的蒋军小炮，提着匣枪。他们都是翻身农民，如今在游击战争中，锻炼得和部队的战士一样英勇顽强的保护群众和自己的利益。敌五军九十六旅一个连，配合土顽两个连，到城武八区抢粮。八区的廿个民兵，拉了廿里宽的战线打枪，迷惑敌人，一直坚持了两个钟头，使三个连的敌人不敢前进。老百姓在这个空隙里把东西藏起来人躲了。蒋匪的大股军队驻在城武，每天夜里四面响着民兵的枪声、蒋匪十分惊惶，睡不成觉。有时仅一个民兵单独到敌人驻地附近去打枪，扰乱捕捉零星的匪兵。一次敌两路大军从城武经过，中间每隔一连，就有一个蒋军骑洋车子的，被我在高粱棵里隐避的民兵上去，把洋车推倒，骑上就走，敌军拉电线时民兵们就跟着割电线。光今年上半年，城武民兵配合干部即割电线五百余斤。靠山王岗一带的民兵，还不断用机枪小炮打跑或毙伤企图抢掠的敌人，他们立了不少功，出现了不少英雄。夜战，是单东一带民兵最熟练的本领，他们能以少数的武装，打败大股的敌人。单东×庄的民兵，麦后仅有五棵枪，夜里在房子上站岗，忽然听着高粱里有动静，原来是三百多蒋匪，正准备向村里进攻。民兵发觉了大声喊道：“高粱棵里干啥的？”高粱棵的响声停止了，但没有任何人回答。民兵照着高粱棵响过的地方就是一枪，敌人知道已被发觉，机枪大炮四处向民兵打来。六挺机枪直对着民兵的院子打。英勇的民兵沉着的向敌人还击，一面喊：“一营从两边攻，二营、三……。”敌人搞不清情况，光打枪不敢前进。不一会别村的民兵来接应了，民兵们喊着：“一营从南边上来啦！”蒋匪吓的抱头乱窜。又有一次，×村的三个民兵夜里放哨走到村前路沟里，蹲下往东一望，暗的远处隐约看见黑压压的一队人马，他们便南边一个，北边一个散开，这队人马越走越近了，在星光下看清是来抢掠的蒋匪，三个人便从三面一齐开枪，毫无准备的蒋匪扭头就跑，三个民兵也不呐喊，光在后面追赶，把六十多个逃兵赶了一里多地。今年春天，在单东等处几乎每夜都听到枪响。有的是赶跑蒋匪，有的是毙伤敌人。
