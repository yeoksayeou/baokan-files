[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Dispatch] Insect pests have been discovered in parts of villages in fourteen counties within the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Ninth Sub-regions. The Regional Party Committee has called for emergency eradication. Various locations are currently engaged in eradication efforts. In Yanggu County of the Ninth Sub-region, parts of villages in the First, Fourth, and Seventh Districts have discovered insect pests. The insects are about six or seven fen (approximately 2 cm) long and come in three colors: yellow, red, and patterned. One type of insect is called "@ Emperor insect," and another is called "boring insect." In the morning, they climb to the heart of the corn stalks, with at least two to four insects per stalk. In the afternoon, they go halfway down the corn stalk and hide in the leaf sheaths, becoming more difficult to extract the harder you try. Upon discovering the pests, the sub-district committees immediately arranged inspections and mobilized the masses to eradicate them. Currently, over two hundred mu of millet have been saved. On the 25th evening, the county held an emergency meeting specifically to study eradication methods. After the meeting, teams were dispatched to the affected areas to lead the eradication efforts. In Shou Zhang County, hairy caterpillars have been widely discovered in the First, Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Districts, with the First and Sixth Districts being the most severely affected; the corn has already been eaten clean! In Fan County's First District, the area affected by the insect plague covers about seven to eight li, and some corn has already been eaten clean. The masses lack confidence in eradication, and the leadership is not resolute, lacking confidence, leading to the spread and expansion of the insect plague. Attention has now been paid, and eradication efforts are being led. In Neihuang County's First District, only nine out of seventy-four villages are not infested, with twenty-seven villages being the most severely affected; one-third of the corn has been eaten. Some villages have lost half of their crops. The masses in villages such as Yangliu Village, Houliu Village, Wangying, and Hanchao Village launched surprise attacks and have now mostly eradicated the pests. After the insect plague was discovered in the Second District of Shanghe, the county headquarters led the masses to go to the fields together to eradicate the pests, eliminating the insects on more than forty mu of land in one afternoon, ensuring that the grain harvest will not be reduced. Insects have also appeared in Dongke Zhuohezhai and Xiaolou in the Third District. According to incomplete statistics, the crops on more than fifty mu of land have been damaged. The village cadres of Yulintou Village specifically assigned leadership, ensuring that no crops were damaged. They organized groups of eight to ten people, with one village cadre leading two groups. Because the division of labor was clear and manpower was not wasted, progress was rapid, and two hundred people eradicated the insects on forty mu of millet fields in one day. After insects were discovered in Nanxiao Village in the Fourth District of Kunwu, some old women burned incense and prayed to the gods, resulting in crop damage. Resolute eradication efforts protected the seedlings. A total of fourteen counties in the region have discovered insect plagues. The Regional Party Committee has called on cadres, personnel, and rural branch members of Party, government, and military at all levels to immediately organize forces in areas where insect plagues have been discovered to lead the masses in eradication efforts. It is imperative to quickly eliminate the pests and resolutely prevent their spread and development. In the process of pest eradication, cadres and Party members should personally take action, stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses, and carry forward the spirit of the 1944 locust control campaign. Concentrate the various experiences of the masses and create various methods, such as organizing various forms of mutual assistance and adopting commendation and reward measures. Finally, it is proposed that in order to eradicate insect pests, it is necessary to vigorously organize mutual assistance on a voluntary and equivalent basis, eliminate wasteland, strive to plant all wasteland during the autumn plowing and sowing movement, and cultivate the areas where insect pests have been discovered in order to eliminate the breeding and prevent future troubles.
