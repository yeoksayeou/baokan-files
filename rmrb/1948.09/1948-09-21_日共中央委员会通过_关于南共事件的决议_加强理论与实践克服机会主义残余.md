　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Electronegative News Agency reported: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party passed a resolution on the South Communist incident on the 15th. The resolution declared: The South Communist incident "is not an isolated phenomenon caused by Tito's personality and the unique environment of the South country, but rather a mistake made by petty-bourgeois elements in the anti-imperialist communist international movement." The error of the South Communist leadership "is a major lesson for the Japanese Communist Party. The Japanese Communist Party deeply understands the necessity of strengthening its theory and practice." The resolution pointed out that there are still some opportunistic remnants within the Japanese Communist Party. The truth derived from the South Communist incident should be taken as a warning by all members of the Japanese Communist Party, whose membership has greatly increased since the end of the Great War.
    　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. TASS reported: The Japanese Alliance for the Defense of Democracy, newly formed by progressive groups and progressive individuals, sent a letter to Wallace on the 10th, congratulating the program of the American Progressive Party. The letter emphasized: "The Japanese ruling class is once again adopting fascist methods to suppress the working class and is restoring imperialism in Japan." The Alliance for the Defense of Democracy is launching a resolute struggle against these. The letter, pointing out the consistency of the goals of the Alliance for the Defense of Democracy and the Progressive Party, expressed the firm determination to fight for the defense of political freedom, world peace, national independence, and against the revival of fascist forces. The Alliance for the Defense of Democracy also protested to the Far Eastern Commission against the Japanese government's adoption of a reactionary policy that openly undermines the democratization of Japan. Note: The Far Eastern Commission was established according to the decision of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1945, and is composed of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, China, France, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada, India, the Philippines and New Zealand, and is responsible for making decisions on Japan. However, due to obstruction by the US, it failed to carry out its tasks.

  　关于南共事件的决议
    加强理论与实践克服机会主义残余
    日本保卫民主同盟致函华莱士与进步党一致反对法西斯复活
    【新华社陕北十八日电】电通社报导：日本共产党中央委员会于十五日通过关于南共事件的决议。决议宣称：南共事件“不是由铁托个性及南国特有环境所造成的孤立现象，而是小资产阶级分子在反帝的共产主义国际运动中所犯的错误。”南共领导的错误，“乃是对于日本共产党的一大教训，日共深知加强其理论与实践之必要”。决议指出：日共党内仍有若干机会主义残余。从南共事件中得出的真理，应让自大战结束以来党员人数业已大增的日共的一切党员引以为训。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社报导：新近由进步团体及进步人士组成的日本保卫民主同盟于十日致函华莱士，祝贺美国进步党的纲领。该信强调指出：“日本统治阶级正再次采用着法西斯方法镇压工人阶级，并在日本恢复帝国主义”，保卫民主同盟正为反对这些而发动坚决的斗争。该信于指出保卫民主同盟与进步党目标的一致时，表示为保卫政治自由、世界和平、国家独立及反对法西斯力量复活而斗争的坚定决心。保卫民主同盟并向远东委员会抗议日本政府采取公然破坏日本民主化的反动方针。按：远东委员会系根据一九四五年十二月莫斯科三国外长会议的决定设立的，由苏、英、美、中、法、荷、澳、加、印、菲暨新西兰等国组成，本负有对日决策之责，然因美方阻梗，未能执行任务。
