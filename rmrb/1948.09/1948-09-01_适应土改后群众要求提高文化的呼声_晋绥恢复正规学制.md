　　To Adapt to the Masses' Demand for Increased Culture After Land Reform
  　Jin Sui Restores Formal Education System
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 28th】 Due to severe disasters, school education in Jin Sui has suffered greatly in the past two years. At present, in order to adapt to the masses' urgent demand for improving culture after the land reform, various places have been actively engaged in restoring school education according to the degree of disaster reduction in their respective areas. The Jin Sui Sub-bureau also issued the "Instructions on Restoring School Education in Disaster Areas" to party committees at all levels on "August 1st." It pointed out that schools that have been closed down in various places should be restored step by step and with emphasis, according to the specific situation. The educational policy should focus on cultural and professional courses. Extracurricular activities, in addition to student self-government activities, should be reduced as much as possible in terms of meetings and production. The years of study for students should be strictly implemented according to regulations, and they should not be arbitrarily sent in or transferred out. Children of all classes, including those of landlords and rich peasants, should have the opportunity to enroll. Public expense quotas should be appropriately established for poor military, martyrs' families, and general poor children to solve their enrollment difficulties. In addition, various schools should immediately try out half-day classes and night classes, and winter schools should be opened in winter. Each county should also try out a cadre class in primary schools, etc., to provide more learning opportunities for farmers, farm women, and new and old cadres who are busy with production. Regarding the issue of teachers, the instructions pointed out that regardless of their background or past experience, intellectuals who are competent in academic ability can be requested by the government for appointment, except for those who are indeed counter-revolutionaries. Those who have been transferred to other positions after the land reform should be requested by the government to be transferred back to educational positions, and those who have been suspended at home should be reinstated. A group of cadres, especially women cadres, should be transferred to school education work according to the actual situation, and teacher training classes should be held during the gap between semesters to actively pay attention to cultivating and improving teachers. At present, the original experimental schools, Chengcheng, Helong, Hechang, No. 1 Middle School, and No. 2 Middle School in the old areas of Jin Northwest have been restored from short-term training courses for district and village cadres to formal education systems, and have begun to enroll new students in various places. Each county in Lan County, Lin County, Lishi, and Zhongyang has restored one or two complete primary schools and more than ten general primary schools. In addition to the original teachers, more than 300 students were transferred from Helong Middle School to serve as teachers in various places. All primary and secondary schools in the new districts will start school after the summer vacation. Linfen currently has Linfen Middle School, Linfen Normal School, and Private Pingshui Middle School, with nearly 2,000 students. Linfen Middle School was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit wounded soldiers' hospitals before liberation. After active repairs and rectification by the democratic government, enrollment and school began, and there are nearly 1,000 students. Pingshui Middle School was formed by the merger of Private Fenbin and Zili schools, with Zhang Zigao, the former principal of Zili Middle School, and Pan Fengzhi, the principal of Fenbin Middle School, serving as principals and vice principals respectively. Part of the funding is subsidized by the government. Xinjiang Middle School and the city's four complete primary schools also started school in July, and the number of students has greatly increased compared to the past.

　　适应土改后群众要求提高文化的呼声
  　晋绥恢复正规学制
    【新华社晋绥二十八日电】晋绥学校教育近两年来因严重灾荒，损失极大。目前为适应土地改革后群众迫切要求提高文化的呼声，各地已按当地灾情减轻程度，积极从事恢复学校教育的工作。晋绥分局并于“八一”向各级党委发出“关于恢复受灾区域学校教育的指示”。指出各地停办之学校应即按具体情况有步骤有重点的加以恢复。教育方针应以文化课、业务课为主。课外活动除学生自治活动外，开会、生产等应尽量减少。学生受业年限应认真按规定执行，不得任意送进调出。各阶层子弟包括地主富农子弟在内均应有入学机会。对贫苦军、烈属及一般贫穷子弟应适当设立公费名额，解决其入学困难。此外各校应即试办半日班、夜班，冬季开办冬学，各县并在完小内试办一个干部班等，予生产繁忙的农民农妇及新老干部以更多的学习机会。关于师资问题，指示指出：不论何种出身，有过何种经历的知识分子，凡学识能力称职者，除确系反革命分子外，均可提请政府任用。土改后调任他职者，应请政府调回教育岗位，停职在家者，应予复职。并应根据实际情况调一批干部特别是妇女干部转入学校教育工作，及利用学期空隙办教员训练班，积极注意培养与提高师资。目前晋西北老区原有之实验学校、成成、贺龙、贺昌、一中、二中等中学，已由训练区村干部的短期班制恢复为正规学制，开始在各地招收新生。岚县、临县、离石、中阳等每县已恢复完小一、二所及普小十余所，各地除原有教员外，另由贺龙中学抽调三百余学生任职。新区各中小学校则于暑假期满后全部开学。临汾现有临汾中学、临汾师范及私立平水中学三所，有学生近两千名。临汾中学解放前为蒋阎匪伤兵医院霸占，经民主政府积极修理整顿后，招生开学，现有学生近千人。平水中学系由私立汾滨及自立两校合并而成，由原自立中学校长张子高，汾滨中学校长潘逢治分任正副校长，经费由政府补助一部。新绛中学及该市完小四所亦均于七月开学，学生较前大增。
