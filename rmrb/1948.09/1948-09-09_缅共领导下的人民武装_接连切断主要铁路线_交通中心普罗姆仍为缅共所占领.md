Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Reports from various sources indicate that the people's armed forces under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party (BCP) are actively operating in central Burma. The BCP armed forces have repeatedly cut off the Rangoon-Mandalay railway line that runs north-south through Burma; fierce fighting also broke out in Toungoo District and Pegu, where the BCP forces are strong, on August 30th. In the west, some important cities along the Irrawaddy River have become battlefields. A Reuters dispatch on the 1st stated that the transportation hub of Prome is still occupied by the BCP forces; Sagaingmyo, a well-known cement manufacturing center, was also occupied by the BCP forces on August 10th. On September 1st, battles also took place between the BCP army and the reactionary government army in Shwezayan, northwest of Mandalay, and in Monywa on August 30th. The BCP army is very active in the Irrawaddy Delta and near Bassein. Moreover, according to the Associated Press, a "rebellion" broke out in the Karenni hills northeast of Toungoo on August 26th. At the same time, armed forces defecting from the volunteer army are operating in western and southern Burma. Sagaingmyo was also briefly occupied by this unit on the 22nd. Kyauktan northeast of Rangoon, Thanlyin to the southeast, Syriam, Burma's largest oil depot three miles from Rangoon, Dala one mile from Rangoon, and Hmawbi to the north have all been occupied by mutinous volunteer forces opposing Thakin Nu.
  Such widespread armed struggle has alarmed the British and American imperialists, the masters of the Burmese government. The Manchester Guardian, representing the interests of the British big bourgeoisie, published an article on August 17th, anxiously demanding that the British government openly step forward to suppress the Burmese people with armed force. The newspaper stated: "As far as Britain is concerned, we can better assist Burma by setting an example than by giving admonitions. This example is to resolutely and effectively implement military actions appropriate to the situation, as in Malaya." The American imperialists have also eagerly taken measures to interfere in Burma's internal affairs. According to a United Press reporter on August 24th, the United States has agreed to the British transfer of leased materials from the Middle East to the Burmese government. American officials also emphasized that the British government should hold direct negotiations with the Burmese government on military assistance.

　　缅共领导下的人民武装
  　接连切断主要铁路线
  　交通中心普罗姆仍为缅共所占领
    【新华社陕北六日电】各方报导：缅共领导下的人民武装正积极活动于缅甸的中部。缅共武装曾接连切断纵贯缅甸南北的仰光至曼德勒的铁路线；而缅共力量强大的倘古区及庇古，八月卅日亦发生激战。在西部，沿伊洛瓦底江的一些重要城市已成为战场。路透社一日消息称，交通中心的普罗姆仍为缅共部队所占领；著名的水泥制造中心萨页谬，八月十日亦曾为缅共部队占领。本月一日在曼德勒西北的舒砂及八月卅日在蒙尼亚，缅共军与反动政府军亦均有战斗。伊洛瓦底江三角洲及巴森附近，缅共军很活跃。不仅如此，据美联社称，在倘古东北的卡伦尼山地，八月二十六日也爆发了“叛乱”。同时由志愿军哗变出来的武装，正在缅甸西部及南部活动。萨页谬于二十二日，也一度为这方面活动中的该部武装所占领。仰光东北的开阳，东南的丹瓦，距仰光三哩的缅甸最大油库锡库，和距仰光一哩的达拉以及北面的茂比，都曾为反抗达钦努的志愿军哗变部队所占领。
    如此广泛的武装斗争，使缅甸政府的主子英美帝国主义惊惶失措。代表英国大资产阶级利益的曼彻斯特卫报于八月十七日著论，焦急的要求英政府公开出面武装镇压缅甸人民。该报称：“就英国而论，我们采取以身作则的方式，较诸告诫方式将能更有助于缅甸，这种以身作则，就是与在马来亚一样，坚决而有效地施行与情势相适应的军事行动”。美帝国主义者亦急切地采取了干涉缅甸内政的措施。据合众社记者八月二十四日透露，美国已同意英方以英国在中东的租借物资转交缅甸政府。美国官员并强调英政府应与缅甸政府举行关于军事援助的直接谈判。
