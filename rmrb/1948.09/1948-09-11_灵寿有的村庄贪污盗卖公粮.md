To the Editor:

Recently, it has been discovered that many local and warehouse leaders are not taking care of grain, and are not responsible for its storage, causing the grain to rot. Some are even embezzling and stealing. This selfish behavior, which disregards the people's hard work and harms the interests of the revolution, should be given high attention by leading organs at all levels. Here are some opinions based on materials reported by the Fourth Special Prefecture of the North Yue District: The grain sub-depot in Nan Jicheng, Fifth District of Lingshou County, has incomplete accounts that cannot be reconciled. A false seal is pasted on the door of the grain depot, and it is used more than a dozen times. Village cadres privately open the seal at any time to "borrow grain." According to the existing figures, the hall has borrowed more than 14,000 catties of grain (including 25 times by 13 cadres, and also borrowed by people with so-called good relations with cadres). In the village of Bei Jicheng in the same district, the main responsible cadres used the price difference between the public grain discount and the market price to sell public grain in large quantities, profiting more than 12 million yuan. With such income, they wasted it greatly, spending more than 310,000 yuan on travel expenses alone, and the village chief privately borrowed 61,000 yuan. Mengjiatuo cadres privately sold about 6,000 catties of public grain. In Zhongqingjing Village, nine cadres including Han Niannian privately divided 2,413 catties of public grain into their own pockets, benefiting themselves at the expense of the public. Cadres in Nantixia Village stole 750 catties of public grain and 82 catties of cotton. Li Qiusheng, an old grain official, reported 120 catties more per scale when sending wheat to the warehouse, and the cadres divided the spoils. Wang Jiansheng and others in Xicheng Nanwang could not find the whereabouts of 700 catties of rice supplied to the military. After the Gangbei Poor People's Group pretended to help newly liberated farmers, they privately used 2,000 catties of grain. This spring, the Third Grain Depot milled more than 700,000 catties of rice, but more than 120,000 catties have not been recovered. Sun Shuande in Xiguan Village mixed more than 30 catties of sand into each bag of rice he delivered. The Wujiazhuang rice milling team bought 32 dou of sprouted grain and privately used it to offset public grain rice. Among the eight rice milling households in Beihu, seven ate and sold grain privately. Meng Tuo's Meng Shubao privately sold 400 catties of milled rice to use as his own rickshaw capital.

The above-mentioned serious phenomena of anarchy and lack of discipline probably exist not only in Lingshou. This should arouse widespread inspection in various places. This is certainly due to the selfishness and irresponsibility of the cadres of various grain depots, but it is actually caused by the bureaucratic style of the leading organs, the lack of inspection, and the failure to educate the cadres. It is suggested that leaders in various places should combine "Lenin on How Soviet Officials Should Work" to examine their own work, strictly implement the grain depot system, clarify responsibilities, and give appropriate punishment to those who make serious mistakes or persist in their errors. Those who are corrupt should be ordered to return the money, and those who manage grain well should also be commended. Thoroughly rectifying grain depots should be the urgent task of leading organs at all levels. (Hao Jimin, Zhang Haoran of the Finance Department)

### 灵寿有的村庄贪污盗卖公粮

　　灵寿有的村庄贪污盗卖公粮编辑同志：
    近来发现很多地方及仓库负责干部，对粮食不加爱护，保管不负责任，致使粮食腐烂，有的竟贪污盗卖。这种对人民血汗不负责任，损害革命利益的自私肥己行为，应引起各级领导机关高度的注意。兹仅据北岳四专署报告的材料提出一些意见：灵寿县五区南纪城粮食分库，帐目不全，无法对帐，粮库门上虚贴一张封条，每每都用十几次之多，村干部随时私自揭开封条“借粮”，根据现有的数字，该厅共借出一万四千多斤粮食（内干部十三个借二十五次，还有所谓与干部关系好的人借的）。该区北纪城村，主要负责干部利用公粮折价和市价差额，大批出卖公粮，从中取利一千二百万余元，有了这样的收入，即大加浪费，只盘费即用去三十一万余元，村长私借六万一千元。孟家托干部私卖公粮约六千斤，中顷井村干韩年年等九人，私将公粮二千四百一十三斤分入私囊，损公肥己。南堤下村干部偷公粮谷七百五十斤，棉花八十二斤，旧粮秣干部李秋生，送麦入库时，多报一秤一百二十斤，干部分了赃。西城南王建生等将供给军用的七百斤米找不到下落。岗北贫民团假借帮助新翻身农民过后，私用粮食二千斤。三粮库今春碾米七十余万斤，迄今尚有十二万余斤收不回来。西管村孙拴德交上口袋米即掺沙三十余斤。吴家庄碾米组，买成生了芽的谷子三十二市斗，私自抵换公粮米。北湖八个碾米户，吃卖者即有七户。孟托孟书保将碾的米私卖四百斤作自己推车本钱用。
    以上这些无政府无纪律的严重现象，恐不仅灵寿一地存在，应引起各地普遍的检查。这固然是各粮库干部自私自利不负责任，但实为领导机关的官僚主义的作风，缺乏检查，对干部不加教育所造成。建议各地领导者，应结合“列宁论苏维埃机关人员应如何工作”，检查自己工作，严格粮库制度，明确责任，对错误严重或坚持错误者，应给予适当处分，贪污者勒令退出，而粮食保管好的，亦应加以表扬。彻底整顿粮库，应为各级领导机关当前急务。（财政厅郝济民、张浩然）
