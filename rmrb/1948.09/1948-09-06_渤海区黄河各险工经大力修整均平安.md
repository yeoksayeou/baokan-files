Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd. The dangerously engineered sections of the Yellow River in the Bohai area are safe. When the Yellow River rose for the second time in mid-August, the water level at Zhangxiaotang in Bin County reached 14.13 meters, only 0.74 meters lower than the highest water level last year. The first time was on the 7th of last month, and the water level was the same as this time. The most dangerous engineered sections along the river, such as in Putai, Lijin, Bin County, and Huimin counties, are all safe because they have been heavily repaired this year. However, the Wangjiazhuang dangerously engineered section in Lijin was scoured by the main stream, and the straw mats protecting the bank were washed away. More than 300 cubic meters of stones were dragged by more than 700 residents from Zhangwo and other villages to repair and block the breach, and it has been restored to its original state. Some of the groynes at the Zhangxiaotang dangerously engineered section were also damaged, and they have been consolidated after days of repairs. When this dangerously engineered section was repaired last year, the groynes and other structures were mostly built gropingly at night because of the constant shooting by the Kuomintang bandit troops on the south bank, so they were not strong enough.

　　渤海区黄河各险工经大力修整均平安
    【新华社华东二日电】渤海地区黄河各险工平安。上月中旬黄河第二次上涨时，滨县张肖堂水位达十四点一三公尺，比去年最高水位仅低零点七四公尺。第一次为上月七日，水位与此次相同。沿河最险要的蒲台、利津、滨县、惠民等县险工，因经今年大力修整，均平安无恙。惟利津王家庄险工，因大溜冲刷，挡水的秸扫掉蛰，经张窝等村七百多居民拖石三百多方修堵，已恢复原状。张肖堂险工部分埽坝发生掉蛰，经连日修整，亦趋巩固。该险工去年抢修时，因南岸国民党匪军不断射击，埽坝等多在夜间摸索着做成，因此不够巩固。
