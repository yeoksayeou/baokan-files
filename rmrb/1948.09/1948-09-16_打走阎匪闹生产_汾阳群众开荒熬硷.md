　　Fighting to oust the Bandit Yan and Stir Up Production
    Fenyang Masses Reclaim Land and Boil Alkali

    [Jinzhong News] In Fenyang, the combination of land reclamation and alkali boiling has formed a movement, achieving great results. In thirty-one natural villages in the third, fifth, and eighth districts, 11,408 mu of wasteland was eliminated in four or five days, accounting for more than 52 percent of the wasteland area. In the process of land reclamation, the masses invented a method of boiling alkali using Korean artemisia, gray shrubs, and broom grass ash, which further promoted the land reclamation movement. Under the assistance of the democratic government, Renyan Village has established an alkali plant. When the masses reclaim land, they cut down the Korean artemisia, gray shrubs, and broom grass that are taller than a person in the wasteland, burn them into ash, and sell the ash to the alkali plant. Each jin of ash can be sold for six liang of wheat, and at least six jin of wheat can be exchanged per day. The alkali plant uses ash to boil alkali, with each pot yielding 160 to 210 jin, with an average of three jin of ash producing one jin of alkali. Each jin of alkali can earn a profit of two jin and fourteen liang of wheat. Influenced by Renyan Village, the masses in Ji Village, Da Village, and other nine villages have learned to boil alkali and converted the eighteen salt houses that were suspended under the rule of Bandit Yan into alkali plants, boiling hundreds of pots of alkali in nine days, with each pot yielding at least fifty jin, earning more than ten thousand jin of wheat. This greatly increased the number of people participating in land reclamation, grass cutting, and ash burning. Eighty-three people from Renyan, a natural village, participated. In Zhangjiabao in the third district and Renyan in the fifth district, two natural villages, two hundred and thirty-five women and children participated in land reclamation and production. Lu Dafu (poor peasant) from Zhangjiabao does everything from hoeing to cutting and carrying, and the masses call her a female labor hero. Some villages have also established blackboard newspapers to commend the good and criticize the lazy.

　　打走阎匪闹生产
    汾阳群众开荒熬硷
    【晋中讯】汾阳开荒与熬硷结合形成运动，获得很大成绩。三、五、八区三十一个自然村，四、五天内消灭荒地一一四○八亩，占荒地面积百分之五十二强。群众在开荒中发明了用韩蓬、灰条、扫帚草灰熬硷的办法，进一步推动了开荒运动。仁岩村在民主政府帮助下，已成立了一座硷厂。群众开荒时，将荒地中一人多高的韩蓬、灰条、扫帚草割掉，烧成灰，将灰卖给硷厂，每斤灰可卖得六两小麦，每天至少可换六斤麦。硷厂用灰熬硷，每锅可熬一百六十斤至二百一十斤，平均三斤灰出一斤硷。每斤硷可获利二斤十四两小麦。在仁岩村影响下，冀村、大相等九个村群众均学会熬硷，并将在阎匪统治下停顿了的十八座盐房改为硷厂，九天熬硷百锅，每锅至少五十斤，可赚麦万余斤。这样开荒割草烧灰的人大大增加。仁岩一个自然村即有八十三人参加。三区张家堡、五区仁岩两个自然村，有二三五个妇女儿童参加开荒生产。张家堡路大富（贫农）的女人锄割刨担，样样都干，群众称她为女劳动英雄。有的村还建立了黑板报，表扬好的，批评赖的。
