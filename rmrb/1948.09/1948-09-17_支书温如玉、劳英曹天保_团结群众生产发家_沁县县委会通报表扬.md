[Taiyue Electric Dispatch] The Qin County Party Committee issued a commendation for model Branch Secretary Wen Ruyu and Labor Hero Cao Tianbao, calling on all county branches and party members to learn from their example of leading and uniting all social strata to develop production and prosper. Comrade Wen Ruyu is the branch secretary and cooperative manager of Shihe Village, consistently loyal to the Party and responsible to the people. The Shihe Cooperative was established on a trial basis in 1942, but suffered four failures due to incorrect policies. In August of last year, Comrade Wen Ruyu was determined to run the cooperative well, reviewed the lessons of the failures, and established a policy of developing production. First, he and Wen Changyi, Wang Sanyi, and others used their own capital to try their best to run an oil pressing workshop, earning more than 30,000 yuan. With this as capital, they founded the cooperative, organizing the masses for transportation and sideline production in addition to oil pressing. Because the policy was correct, they earned a lot of money and were supported by the masses. As a result, the cooperative gradually developed and integrated with agricultural production. Secondly, Comrade Ruyu worked hard and never used public property for personal gain. Thirdly, Comrade Ruyu was able to consult with everyone on everything. During the land reform movement, whether it was struggle or the distribution of fruits, he would consult with everyone to make decisions. The same was true in leading production. Under the influence of Comrade Ruyu's exemplary style, all the cadres in the village were able to endure hardship before enjoying comfort, and were able to unite the masses. Comrade Cao Tianbao is the branch secretary of Bao Village, born a tenant farmer, and has a hardworking and dedicated work style. After the land reform movement, he devoted all his efforts to leading and uniting all social strata in production. As a result, Bao Village was recognized as a model village for production in the entire district, and Comrade Tianbao was also elected as a labor hero. By August 8th, all the wheat fields in the village had been plowed once, the autumn seedlings had been hoed twice, and most of the manure for the wheat fields had been prepared. Now they are working intensely to cut artemisia and compost manure.

　　支书温如玉、劳英曹天保
  　团结群众生产发家
  　沁县县委会通报表扬
    【太岳电】沁县县委会通报表扬模范支部书记温如玉及劳动英雄曹天保，号召全县支部及党员学习他们领导与团结各阶层生产发家的范例。温如玉同志是石壑村支部书记兼合作社经理，一贯对党忠实，对人民负责。石壑合作社于一九四二年试办，因方针不对，连遭四次失败。去年八月，温如玉同志决心要办好合作社，检讨了失败的教训，确定了发展生产的方针。先和温常义、王三义等用自己资本，努力试办一个榨油坊，赚下了三万多元，就以这为资本创办合作社，除榨油外还组织群众运输的副业生产。因为方针对头，就赚了很多钱，受到群众拥护。因此合作社逐渐发展，并与农业生产结合。其次，如玉同志克苦耐劳，从不私用公家一点东西。第三，如玉同志能作到有事就和大家商量。在翻身运动中，无论斗争、分配果实都要和大家商量决定，在领导生产中也是如此。在如玉同志的模范作风影响下，该村全体干部都能吃苦在前，享受在后，并能团结群众。曹天保同志是堡村支部书记，佃户出身，有任劳任怨埋头苦干的作风。翻身运动后，就全力领导与团结各阶层生产，堡村因此被认为全区生产模范村，天保同志也被选为劳动英雄。至八月八日，全村麦地已犁过一遍，秋苗已锄过二遍，麦地粪也大部准备妥当，现正紧张的割蒿沤粪。
