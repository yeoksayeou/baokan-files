　　【Taihang News】In order to prepare for this winter's production and support the masses' autumn harvest and wheat planting, Lincheng convened a county-wide meeting of village and district cooperative directors on the 7th of last month. The meeting revealed that, with the exception of a few cooperatives that were relatively well-run (such as Fangnao), most villages were in a state of stagnation or collapse. The main reasons for this were unclear business directions, failure to cater to the needs of the masses, failure to support mass production, and a focus on mere profit. In addition, many village cooperatives sold goods to members at excessively low prices, and with a one-sided pro-poor peasant/hired laborer viewpoint and a paternalistic approach, extended large amounts of credit to take care of the interests of poor peasants, leading many village cooperatives to a standstill. In response to these reasons, the meeting studied rectification methods and clarified business directions. After the meeting, all villages actively carried out rectification. In the space of ten days, twenty-four villages have achieved preliminary results: First, clearing outstanding debts. According to statistics from Wangjiazhuang, Chengyang and other twelve villages, a total of 2.16 million yuan was owed, of which 1.68 million yuan has been recovered, accounting for 77.7% of the total outstanding debts. The recovery process is now being carried out universally. Another aspect is the re-election of cadres and the resolution of compensation issues. For example, Zilizhuang decided that cadres working in the cooperative, in addition to fulfilling the corvée labor required of each able-bodied person in the village, would have the cooperative pay wages to hire people to do the work for the extra labor days, while the cadres themselves would be responsible for their own meals. The cooperative would distribute profits according to an 80/20 split. When the iron factory in Zhangjiazhen was established, it did not consult with the masses, and the compensation issues for workers were not well resolved. Workers lacked motivation, and the factory collapsed in February of this year. Rectification has now been carried out, the leadership has made self-criticisms, accounts have been settled and announced, and a new manager has been re-elected, and workers' compensation has been stipulated. The factory has opened the furnace twice in half a month, doubling the previous rate of twice a month. The masses reflected: "This time it's sure to be better than last time, the manager is an expert!" There are plans to purchase large quantities of pig iron and open more furnaces. The Shilou Village cooperative bought a tree and plans to organize transportation. Chengyang plans to buy cotton carding bows. Wangjiazhuang plans to purchase cotton, preparing to support mass winter weaving and solve raw material difficulties. However, this is only the beginning of the rectification. There are still pressing problems to be solved: such as cooperative cadres holding too many concurrent positions, affecting their concentration on business. The compensation issue for cadres has not yet been adequately resolved in some villages. Some cooperative directors reflect: "Other work is easy to talk about and easy to handle, but it's not easy to raise the issue of cadre compensation, for fear that the masses will say we're greedy." Currently, all parts of the county are continuing to rectify, further discovering and solving problems, so that cooperatives can be universally restored and developed, laying the foundation for winter production.

　　清理外欠改选干部
  　临城各村积极整顿合作社
    【太行讯】为了有准备的开展今年冬季生产和扶植群众秋收种麦，临城曾于上月七日召开全县村区合作社长会议。会上了解，除一部分合作社办的比较好（如方垴）外，大部村庄陷于停顿与垮台的状态。其原因主要是业务方向不明确，不根据群众需要，不扶植群众生产，单纯营利。还有不少村社，过低价卖给社员东西，再加上片面贫雇观点和恩赐观点，为照顾贫农利益，大量赊欠，许多村社因而停顿。会上针对这些原因，研究了整顿的办法，明确了业务方向。会后各村都在积极进行整顿。十余天的时间，有二十四个村已获得初步成绩：首先是清理欠帐，据王家庄、城阳等十二村统计，共欠款二百一十六万元，已收回一百六十八万元。占全部外欠百分之七十七点七，现正普遍清理中。另外是重新改选了干部，解决了待遇问题。如自立庄决定在社工作干部，除顶全村每个劳力应出的差役外，超过的工数，社里出工资给雇人干活，本人管饭。社里赚了钱按二八分红。张家镇的铁工厂成立时没有和群众商量，对工人待遇问题未很好解决，工人没劲干，今年二月垮了台，现已进行整顿，领导上作了检讨，结算与公布了帐目，重新选了新经理，规定了工人待遇。开门半月就开了两次炉，比过去每月两次增加了一倍。群众反映：“这次准比上次干的好，经理是内行！”现计划大批收买生铁，更多开炉。石楼村社买树一部，准备组织运输。城阳计划买弹花弓。王家庄计划收买棉花，准备扶植群众冬季纺织，解决原料困难。但这仅是整顿的开始，目前仍存在着急待解决的问题：如合作社干部兼职太多，影响专心业务。干部的待遇问题，仍有部分村未得到适当解决。有的社长反映：“旁的工作都好说，也好办，就是干部待遇不好提，怕群众说财迷。”现全县各地，正继续整顿，进一步发现与解决问题，使合作社普遍的恢复发展起来，打下冬季生产的基础。
