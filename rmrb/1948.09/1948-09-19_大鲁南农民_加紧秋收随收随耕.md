Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th: Farmers in Shandong, having weathered the spring and summer droughts, are now intensely engaged in the autumn harvest and are cultivating the land as they harvest. In Linshu (new county, formerly eastern Linyi), after ten days of concentrated effort, 400,000 mu of autumn crops have been completely harvested. In the Lingquan District of Junan (new county, formerly southern Ju County), as of August 26th, over 40,000 mu of wheat fields out of the district's total of 60,000 mu have been cultivated. In the Zhaixi District of Yidong (new county, eastern Yishui), mutual-aid teams of men and women are organized, and the autumn harvest is generally completed ahead of schedule. In Puwang Village of this district, 97 young and middle-aged women and some children cut the ears, bundled sorghum stalks, and pulled cowpea seedlings while the adult men and women were cutting sorghum. This enabled the village's six-day harvesting plan to be basically completed in four days, and the 26 head of cattle in the mutual-aid group then went to the slopes to plow the land. In areas lacking draft animals, under the slogan of "early cultivation, early planting, early eating," autumn cultivation is carried out by people pulling plows while harvesting. The frontier area of Linshu has completed the rush harvest under the combination of labor and armed forces. Before the autumn harvest and autumn cultivation, farmers have been adding livestock and farm implements, and also composting and accumulating fertilizer. The Fuli District of Linshan (new county, formerly northeastern Fei County) purchased more than 200 head of cattle for plowing, and the Lidong District of Pingyi (new county, formerly southern Fei County) added 102 head of cattle and donkeys in July. The Henan District of Yidong added 274 pieces of farm implements such as wheelbarrows and plows. Qushu Village in Junan composted one-third to one-half more fertilizer than in previous years. These new developments have laid a favorable foundation for next year's production plan.

  　加紧秋收随收随耕
    【新华社华东十六日电】渡过了春夏两季灾荒的山东农民，现正紧张进行秋收，并随收随耕。临沭（新县，原临沂东部）经十天突击，四十万亩秋禾已全部登场。莒南（新县，原莒县南部）县岭泉区至八月二十六日止，全区六万亩麦地已耕完四万余亩。沂东（新县，沂水东部）寨西区组织男女变工，普遍提前完成秋收。该区蒲汪庄九十七个青壮妇女及一部儿童在成年男女砍高粱时，她们就割穗子，捆秫秸，拔豇豆秧，使全庄六天收割计划在四天内基本上完成，变工组的二十六犋牲口则随即上坡耕地。在耕牛缺乏地区，也在“早耕早种早吃”的口号下，一边秋收，一边组织人拉犁进行秋耕。临沭边沿区在劳动与武装结合下，已抢收完毕。农民在秋收秋耕前纷纷添置牲畜、农具，并沤粪积肥。临山（新县，原费县东北部）付里区购入耕牛二百余头，平邑（新县，原费县南部）历东区七月份即添买牛驴一百零二头。沂东河南区添置小车、犁等农具达二百七十四件。莒南曲沭村比往年多沤肥三分之一到二分之一。这些新气象，为明年增产计划立下了有利的基础。
