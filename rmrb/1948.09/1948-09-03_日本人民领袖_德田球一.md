　　Japanese People's Leader
　　Tokuda Kyuichi
    Tokuda Kyuichi, the leader of the Japanese people, is the General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party. He is currently 54 years old, born in 1894 in Nago Town, Okinawa Prefecture. During his student days, he studied Marxism and participated in the labor movement. In 1921, Tokuda and other comrades began preparations to establish the Japanese Communist Party. In November 1922, the JCP was officially founded, and he led it in struggle. In June 1923, the JCP was suppressed. Tokuda maintained contact between the Party and the working class in a secret environment. After three and a half years of effort, he restored the Party. Tokuda was also the founder of the left-wing trade union, highly respected by Japanese workers, who affectionately called him "Tokkyu." In 1928, the JCP was suppressed again, and Tokuda was arrested and imprisoned. He maintained the integrity of a Communist in prison for 18 years, continuing the struggle against the enemy heroically and unyieldingly until he was released after Japan's surrender in 1945. In December of the same year, Tokuda led the Fourth Party Congress, which was of great significance in the history of the JCP, and determined the general line of the JCP in the new situation. During the general election last April, he was elected as a member of parliament with more than 70,000 votes as a candidate in Tokyo's Second District. When the Katayama Cabinet resigned this February, the JCP nominated Tokuda as Prime Minister in the parliament controlled by reactionary conservative parties and right-wing socialists, which was supported by 27 left-wing socialists. This reflects Tokuda's prestige among the working class. (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th)

  　德田球一
    日本人民领袖德田球一，是日本共产党的总书记，现年五十四岁，一八九四年生于冲绳县的名护町。他在学生时代就钻研马克思主义和参加职工运动。一九二一年，德田及其他同志，开始筹备成立日本共产党，一九二二年十一月日共正式成立，他就领导它进行斗争。一九二三年六月，日共遭受破坏，德田在秘密环境中保持党与工人阶级的联系，经过三年半的努力，恢复了党。德田也是左翼职工会的创始人，备受日本工人的爱戴，工人群众都亲昵地简呼他为“德球”。一九二八年，日共遭受了破坏，德田被捕入狱，在狱中坚持共产党人的气节长达十八个年头，十八年中英勇不屈地继续对敌斗争，直到一九四五年日本投降后才出狱。同年十二月，德田领导了在日共历史上有重大意义的第四届党代表大会，确定了日共在新形势下的总路线。去年四月大选时，他作为东京第二区的候选人，以七万余票当选为议员。今年二月片山内阁辞职时，在反动的保守政党和右翼社会党人所控制的议会中日共提名德田为首相，曾获得二十七名左派社会党人的支持，这反映了德田在工人阶级中的威信。（新华社陕北三十日电）
