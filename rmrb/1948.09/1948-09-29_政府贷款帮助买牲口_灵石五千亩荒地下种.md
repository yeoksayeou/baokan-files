【Taiyue Telegram】 The Lingshi County government issued grain loans to help people in the newly liberated areas buy livestock and cultivate wheat on wasteland. Due to the exploitation and plunder by the Yan bandit gang, and the drafting of men, large tracts of land in the county were left uncultivated. In the first, second, and third districts, there were over 12,000 mu of wasteland; in Caojialing, 580 mu out of 892 mu were abandoned. After liberation, the local democratic government, in addition to abolishing the Yan bandit gang's "soldier-farmer cooperation," also issued 200 shi of grain loans to help households without livestock or lacking livestock to purchase them. The bank also provided 200 shi of wheat seeds to solve the problem of seed shortage. In the first district, twelve villages with severe difficulties have already purchased 81 heads of livestock. The second district has increased its livestock by 67 heads. With livestock and wheat seeds, the masses are now actively eliminating fallow land and rush-planting wheat. In Chenjiashan, the first district, 280 mu out of 400 mu of wheat fields were previously barren, but now all have been plowed and are being rushed to be planted. In Beiwang Village, 70 mu out of 100 mu of wasteland have been eliminated. According to statistics from the first half of the month, 5,000 mu of wasteland throughout the county have already been sown.

　　政府贷款帮助买牲口
  　灵石五千亩荒地下种
    【太岳电】灵石县政府发放贷粮贷款，帮助新区群众购买牲口，开荒种麦。该县由于阎匪的压榨掠夺，抓丁捕人，土地大批荒芜。一、二、三区有荒地一万二千余亩，曹家岭八百九十二亩地荒了五百八十亩。解放后，当地民主政府除废除阎匪的“兵农合作”外，又发贷粮二百石，帮助无牲口户和缺牲口户买牲口。银行也贷出麦种二百石，解决麦种困难。一区有十二个困难大的村子，已买牲口八十一头。二区增加牲口六十七头。群众有了牲口和麦种，现在积极消灭熟荒，赶种麦子。一区陈家山四百亩麦地，过去荒了二百八十亩，现在都已犁过赶种。北王村一百亩荒地已消灭了七十亩。据上半月统计，全县有五千亩荒地已下种。
