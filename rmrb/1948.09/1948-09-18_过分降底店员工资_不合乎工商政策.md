　　Excessively Lowering Store Employee Wages
  　Not in Accordance with Industrial and Commercial Policies
    To the Editors:
    I am a shop assistant at the Chunheqing Pharmacy in Baixiang city. The salaries of our shop assistants are determined arbitrarily by the manager at the end of each year. However, no one is allowed to withdraw their full salary for the year, and by the following year, due to rising prices, the saved wages lose their value. Last August, the store was confiscated by the government, but some of the shop assistants had received part of their wages for the previous eight months, while others had received nothing at all. Now that the government has returned Chunheqing Pharmacy, the shop assistants are demanding a settlement of the wages owed for the past eight months with the manager. Manager Wang proposed that last year's wages be calculated at 20,000 Jichaos per month, which would not even buy two dou of millet now. Considering that Chunheqing is an average private business, this response to the shop assistants' demands is considered unreasonable. The shop assistants have limited savings beyond clothing expenses and are experiencing difficulties. Everyone is requesting that this matter be written to the newspaper. Is such an excessive reduction of wages in accordance with industrial and commercial policies? Do shop assistants have any protection?
  　　　　　　　　　Baixiang Chunheqing Pharmacy Shop Assistant Wang Qilin
    Answer: In order to develop industry and commerce and implement the labor-capital mutual benefit industrial and commercial policy, we have opposed the leftist tendency of excessively raising wages. However, some businessmen, under the pretext of protecting and developing industry and commerce, excessively reduce the wages of shop assistants and apprentices. Like Manager Wang of Chunheqing mentioned in your letter, who has long suppressed the wages of shop assistants, profiting from the rising prices, and now wants to use the same method to settle the wages owed, is extremely unreasonable. This issue should be resolved reasonably according to the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital, based on the general living conditions at that time and the economic situation of Chunheqing after its return. We hope that the Baixiang County Government and the trade union will assist both parties in resolving this matter reasonably and inform us of the handling situation. At the same time, it is necessary to check whether there are similar deviations in other factories and businesses.  　　——Editor

### 过分降底店员工资　不合乎工商政策

　　过分降底店员工资
  　不合乎工商政策编辑同志：
    我在柏乡城内春和庆药铺当店员，我们店员每年薪资都由经理到年底随便给，但是当年的工资谁也不让支光，到第二年因物价上涨所存工资就吃亏了。在去年八月间柜上被政府没收，可是以前八个月的工资有的店员支了一部分，有的分文未支，现在政府退还了春和庆药铺，店员们都要求与经理清算去年八个月的工资。王经理提出，去年工资每月按冀钞二万元计算，这样现在还买不到二斗小米。按春和庆在普通私营里也是个乙等商号，就这样答复店员的要求，店员都感到不合理，因店员们除去做衣服外剩余有限，都感觉困难，大家都要求把这事写给报社，象这样过分降低工资，是不是合乎工商政策？店员是否还有保障？
  　　　　　　　　　柏乡春和庆药铺店员王岐林
    答：为了发展工商业，执行劳资两利的工商政策，我们曾反对了过分提高工资的左倾偏向。但有些商人借口保护发展工商业，过分降低店员学徒的工资，象你所提春和庆王经理，过去长期积压店员工资，等物价上涨从中取利，现又想仍用前法来清偿所欠工资，是极为不合理的。这个问题，应根据劳资两利的原则，按当时当地一般生活条件，与春和庆退还后的经济情况，合理解决。希望柏乡县府及职工会协助双方合理解决，并将处理情况告诉我们，同时更应检查其他工厂商号中是否也有类似偏向。  　　——编者
