Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd – Reports from various sources: Among the Communist Party members and people of Yugoslavia, the forces supporting the Information Bureau's decision and opposing the Tito leadership group are growing daily. As early as late July, hundreds of Yugoslav students and overseas Chinese students in the Soviet Union issued declarations opposing the Tito group one after another, and wrote to the then-ongoing Fifth Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party requesting the replacement of the party's leaders to bring the party back to the track of Marxism-Leninism. Subsequently, some personnel from the Yugoslav Embassy in the United States, the mission to the United Nations, and the Embassy in Czechoslovakia, disregarding the pressure from their superiors belonging to the Tito group, successively issued joint protest declarations. At the end of July, the Yugoslav Ambassador to Romania, veteran Communist Party member Golobovich, attended the Fifth Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party and witnessed with grief all the measures of the Tito group that betrayed internationalism. After returning to Bucharest, he wrote to the Presidium of the National Assembly of Yugoslavia, protesting the Tito group's anti-Soviet policy and requesting his resignation. Mr. Golobovich simultaneously sent the original letter to Pravda in Moscow for publication and refused the Yugoslav government's order to return home. On August 24, the Yugoslav Minister to Iran, Ali Hodžić, and his staff also issued a statement opposing the Tito group. In addition, the well-known Yugoslav writer Becker, now in Prague, and Yugoslav Communist Party members in France also condemned the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party in mid-August. As for Yugoslavia itself, on August 11, former Chief of the Army General Staff and wartime hero Lieutenant General Jovanović, along with two other senior military officers, left Yugoslavia for Romania due to their opposition to the Tito group. Unfortunately, they were shot by the Tito group's personnel before crossing the border. On August 14, the Deputy Commander of the Yugoslav Army Air Force, Communist Party member Major General Popivoda, flew an aircraft to Romania and wrote to Pravda in Moscow, exposing the truth about the Tito group's anti-Soviet and anti-people policies and the reign of terror in Yugoslavia. In his letter, Popivoda called out: "Yugoslav Communists must bravely begin to work, so as to force the leading organs of our party to abandon their treacherous line, purge the party and government organs, bring them back to the big family of brotherly Communist Parties, and embark on the road of proletarian unity." According to a report by the Electrical News Agency, a Norwegian youth delegation that recently visited Yugoslavia said that even among the activists of the "Tito Youth League," doubts and dissatisfaction with the political line pursued by the Tito group are increasingly expressed. According to the Associated Press and United Press, the Tito group is massively replacing dissidents in various party, government, and military departments, including many senior officials. To date, up to five thousand people have been arrested. However, this reign of terror, as the French Communist Party's L'Humanité stated on August 26, "only proves the existence of forces opposing the current Yugoslav regime that are more powerful than previously imagined, and proves the correctness of the Information Bureau's confidence in the sound forces within the Yugoslav Communist Party" (Electrical News Agency).

　　南共党员与南国人民中
  　反铁托力量益增长
    【新华社陕北二日电】各方报导：南斯拉夫的共产党员与人民中拥护情报局的决定和反对南共领导集团的力量正日益增长。早在七月下旬，数百名南斯拉夫留苏学生与侨民即先后发表宣言反对铁托集团，并致书当时正进行中的南共五届代表大会要求撤换党的领袖使党回复到马列主义的轨道上来。其后，南斯拉夫驻美大使馆、驻联合国使团以及驻捷克大使馆等的一部分人员，均不顾其属于铁托集团的首长之压力，先后联名发表抗议宣言。七月底，南驻罗马尼亚大使、南共老党员高鲁波维区，在列席南共第五届代表大会，痛心地目睹铁托集团一切叛变国际主义的措施，而回到布加勒斯特之后，即致书南人民议会主席团，抗议铁托集团的仇苏政策，并自请辞职。高氏同时将原信寄交莫斯科真理报发表，并拒绝了南政府召他回国的命令。八月二十四日，南驻伊朗公使阿里霍吉区及其属员亦发表声明，反对铁托集团。此外，现在布拉格的南著名作家贝克尔和旅法南共党员亦于八月中旬谴责南共中央。至于在南斯拉夫国内，八月十一日，前陆军参谋总长、战时抗敌英雄尤伐诺维区中将偕其他高级军官二人，因反对铁托集团，离开南国而往罗马尼亚，不幸在通过边境前为铁托集团人员枪杀。至八月十四日又有南陆军航空队副司令、南共党员波比沃达少将驾机飞至罗马尼亚，并致书莫斯科真理报，揭露铁托集团反苏反人民政策的真相与南斯拉夫国内的恐怖统治。波氏在信中号召：“南共党员必须勇敢地着手工作，俾迫使我们党的领导机构放弃其叛变路线，清洗党和政府机构，使之回到兄弟共产党的大家庭中，并走上无产阶级团结的大道。”据电通社报导最近访南归来的挪威青年代表团谈，即使在“铁托青年联盟”的积极分子中也已对铁托集团所奉行的政治路线日益表示怀疑和不满。据美联社与合众社消息：铁托集团正大批撤换党政军各部门中的反对分子，包括许多高级人员在内，迄今被逮捕者已达五千人。但这种恐怖统治，正如八月二十六日法共人道报所称，“只是证明了较以前所想象者更为强大的反对南斯拉夫现政权的力量之存在，并证明情报局决定中对南共党内健全力量的信心之正确”（电通社）。
