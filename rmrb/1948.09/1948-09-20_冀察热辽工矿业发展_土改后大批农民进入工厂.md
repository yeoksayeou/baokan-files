　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th: Public and private industrial and mining enterprises in the Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning area are developing rapidly, and large numbers of liberated peasants are entering factories from the countryside. According to preliminary statistics, there are now more than 25,600 employees in various enterprises in the area (in addition, there are approximately 10,000 fishermen and salt workers in the coastal areas of eastern Hebei), and 20,000 have joined trade unions. In the eastern Hebei military factory alone, new workers from the countryside who entered the factory last year accounted for 55% of the total number of technicians in the factory, and by April of this year, this had increased to 74%. These new workers are enthusiastic about studying technology and are making rapid progress. Yao Baolu improved his work efficiency by 9.85 times within a month of joining the factory. Factories and mines have also made great achievements in increasing production, improving quality, reducing costs, and improving technology. For example, the output of a certain product in a certain military factory increased by 61 times compared with last year. The average daily coal output per person in a certain coal mine in April was 0.3 tons, which increased to 1.3 tons in June. After the employees of a coal mine power plant made an electric drilling machine, the work efficiency was increased tenfold compared with before.

　　冀察热辽工矿业发展
  　土改后大批农民进入工厂
    【新华社东北十六日电】冀察热辽地区公私工矿企业发展迅速，大批翻身农民自农村进入工厂。据初步统计，该区各企业已共有职工二万五千六百余名（此外冀东沿海地区尚有渔盐工人约一万名），参加工会者达二万人。冀东军工厂仅去年由农村进厂做工的新工人即占全厂技工总数百分之五十五，到今年四月已增至百分之七十四。这些新工人热心钻研技术，进步很快。姚保禄来厂一个月，工作效率即提高了九点八五倍。各厂矿在增加产量、提高质量、减低成本、改进技术等方面成就亦大。如某军工厂某项成品产量较去年提高六十一倍，某煤矿四月份每人平均日产煤零点三吨，六月份即增至一点三吨，煤矿发电厂职工在制成电动打眼机后，工作效率较前提高十倍。
