Xinhua News Agency, North China, 26th—According to people coming from Beiping and Tianjin, the people of Beiping and Tianjin have extreme distrust of the Gold Yuan notes issued by the Chiang bandits, and universally believe they are a kind of disguised large denomination bills. Recently, very few people have gone to the banks to exchange them. There is a market but no trade; shop buying and selling has already turned to underground activities. On the Beiping black market, the price of gold has reached 800 million [yuan], 200 million higher than the official price; silver dollars are 8 million per piece, 2 million higher than the limited price; US dollars are 15 million, 3 million higher than the limited price; Elephant brand cigarettes are officially priced at 800 million per carton, but 1.5 billion on the black market; medicine has already exceeded the limited price by 30 to 40 percent. According to the New Star Daily, black markets in Tianjin are as numerous as cattle hairs. In just two days, more than 60 merchants have been investigated and arrested by economic secret agents and police for privately operating black markets.

  　平津人民都不信任它
    【新华社华北二十六日电】据平津来人谈：平津人民对蒋匪所发行之金圆券极不信任，普遍认为是一种变相的大钞。近来到银行兑换者寥寥无几，市场有行无市，商店买卖已转入地下活动。北平黑市金价已达八亿，比官价高二亿；银元每块八百万元，比限价高二百万；美钞一千五百万，比限价高三百万；烟卷大象牌每箱官价八亿，黑市十五亿；药品已超过限价百分之三十至四十。据新星报讯称；天津黑市多如牛毛，两天即有六十余家商户因私营黑市被经济特务及警察查捕。
