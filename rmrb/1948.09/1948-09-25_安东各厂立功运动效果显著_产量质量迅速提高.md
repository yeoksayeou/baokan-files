Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd: Since the launch of production emulation drives, factories in Andong have achieved remarkable results in increasing production, improving quality, and reducing waste. The quality of 44-count yarn, the main product of the Northeast No. 1 Silk Weaving Factory, improved two-fold from the end of July compared to the beginning of May. In early May, there was one slub for every 400 yards, while at the end of July, there was only one slub for every 1,200 yards. Production at the end of July increased by 10% compared to May, and waste was reduced by two-thirds. Before the emulation drive, the Andong Textile Factory produced only 20 yards of cloth per machine per day, and the quality was poor. Now, each machine produces more than 40 yards of cloth, and the quality exceeds the standard. In the past, a cloth-pulling machine could pull 6,000 to 7,000 yards of cloth per machine per day, but now it can pull more than 14,000 yards. The Andong Rubber Factory, which is currently rushing to make cotton shoes, has seen most workers increase their daily output from 20 pairs to 40 pairs. Before the emulation drive, the shipyard needed 380 workdays to build one large ferry. Now, it only needs more than 190 workdays to build two. In order to promptly commend and reward meritorious workers, and to summarize the recent period of emulation drives to promote production, the factories have successively conducted merit evaluations and award ceremonies.

    【新华社东北二十二日电】安东各工厂自开展生产立功运动以后，在提高产量、质量及减少废品上获得显著成绩。东北第一丝织厂主要产品四十四支细纱的质量，七月底较五月初提高两倍，五月初每四百码有一个疙疸，七月底的每一千二百码才有一个疙疸；七月底的产量较五月份增加了百分之十，废品减少了三分之二。安东纺织厂在立功运动前，每天一架机织布二十多码，质量也差，现在每架机织布四十多码，质量超过了标准。拉布机过去每天每机拉布六七千码，现在能拉一万四千多码。正突击做棉鞋的安东胶皮工厂，大部工人每天由做二十双增加到四十双。造船厂在立功运动前，造一只大渡船需工三百八十个，现在造两只需工一百九十多个。现各厂为及时表扬与奖励有功工人，并总结最近一个时期的立功运动，推进生产，已先后进行了评功和奖功。
