　　Are the Family Members of Military Factory Apprentices Considered Military Dependents?

Editor:
    In our village, Liu Xiaodong's elder brother, Liu Qiucheng, was introduced by the district to work as an apprentice in the iron factory of the Military Industry Department the year before last during the first month of the lunar year. His family has 24.5 mu of land, with a family of five and one laborer. During the discussion of providing land cultivation for military dependents in our village, it was decided that he should return the land to other military dependents. In this case, should his family be considered military or industrial dependents, and should they be provided with land cultivation by others?

    Answer: This question has been answered by Comrade Huo Xiuwen of the Civil Affairs Department of the Border Government as follows:
    According to what you said, Liu Xiaodong's elder brother was introduced by the district to work as an apprentice in the iron factory of the Military Industry Department. Treating him as an industrial dependent is inappropriate. If he is a military ordnance worker on the supply system and has obtained military status, he should be treated as a military dependent. If he is a salaried worker and has obtained military status, he can only enjoy the political treatment of a military dependent, but not material subsidies and land cultivation. Otherwise, he can only enjoy the factory insurance law and cannot enjoy military dependent status. Therefore, according to the situation you described, he is working as an apprentice in the factory, and it is unlikely that he has obtained military status. If he has obtained military status, it can be handled according to the above principles. If he has not obtained military status, his family members should perform land cultivation duties like the general public.

专栏：询问与答复

　　军工厂学徒的家属是否算军工属？编辑同志：
    我村刘小东，他的哥哥刘秋成，于前年正月经区上介绍，到军工部铁工厂当学徒，他家有地二十四亩半，人五口，有一个劳力。这次本村讨论给军属代耕地问题，经研究叫他还给别的军属代耕，这样他家是否算军属或工属，应不应给别人代耕？  　　　　　　　　
　　                                      临城祁村阎庆寿
    答：这个问题已请边府民政厅霍秀文同志答复如下：
    据你所谈刘小东的哥哥在家经区上介绍到军工部铁工厂当学徒，按工属待遇是不妥的，如系供给制的军火工人且已取得军籍者，应按军属待遇，如系薪金制且已取得军籍者，只可享受军属之政治待遇，不得享受实物补助和代耕。否则，只可享受工厂保险法，不能享受军属地位。所以按你所说的这个情况，是到工厂当学徒，恐不一定取得军籍，如已取得军籍，即可按以上原则处理，如未取得军籍，其家属应与一般群众一样服代耕勤务。　　　　　　　　　　——编者
