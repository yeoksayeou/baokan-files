Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th. Zhang Hongquan and Yue Hongxiu, carpenters and mechanics in the Boshan West River Mining Area of Shandong, gave play to their creativity and successfully installed a new water bucket car, which increased the drainage of the mine's No. 3 well by nearly three times and saved 60% of labor. The West River Mine has the largest water flow among the mines in the area, with a normal daily water inflow of 3,500 tons. The mine regularly drains water from five wells, with only one well used for coal mining. Among them, No. 3 well, due to poor well construction, could only use leather buckets to draw water. However, the leather buckets could not be equipped with automatic water gates. Therefore, when the bucket reached the wellhead, four workers had to use long hooks to knock the bucket over onto the water pan to release the water. Draining one bucket took two minutes, its capacity was only 0.8 tons, and it could only drain more than 570 tons in a day and night.

After the recovery of West River, mine officials organized mechanical and electrical workers to study improvement methods. Zhang Hongquan and Yue Hongxiu got together to actively research after work, often until late at night. By early May, they finally developed a new water bucket car. The new water bucket car has rails laid on the left and right sides of the wellhead. The water bucket cars are placed on both sides, with the left car connected to the left bucket and the right car connected to the right bucket (the well drains water with two buckets). The bucket mouths of both cars face the water pan, and the bottom plates of the water bucket cars also slope towards the water pan, so the water automatically flows out when the bucket lands on the car. After researching this method, they drew a diagram and requested the machinery and equipment section to manufacture the car rails. This caused a lot of discussion at the time. Some people said, "This is simply too much trouble. We have never encountered this even in a large mine." Yue Hongxiu later told reporters, "I felt half-hearted at the time, fearing that if it wasn't successful, the labor and materials would be wasted." However, the mine quickly approved their plan and explained, "In order to encourage research and creation, even if some labor and materials are wasted, it is worth it."

In mid-May, the new water bucket car was installed, but when it was tested, the water would not flow out, mainly because the slope of the bottom of the water bucket car was not steep enough. Zhang Hongquan was very anxious and immediately re-nailed the bottom of the car. It was raining at the time, and his pants were completely soaked. However, after re-nailing the bottom of the car, the results of the first hour of testing proved to be completely successful. Compared to the past, the time for draining one bucket has been reduced from two minutes to one minute and ten-sevenths of a second. In the past, ten water-scooping workers, including the foreman, were needed day and night, but now four people (divided into two shifts, twelve hours per shift) can do it very easily. And the capacity of the leather bucket, because it no longer relies on manpower to overturn the bucket, has increased from 0.8 to 1.5 tons. More than 2,000 tons of water can be drained in a day and night.

When Yue Hongxiu talked to reporters about the success of this research, he said, "In my opinion, the credit mainly goes to the higher authorities. During the Han Fuju era, the Japanese occupation era, and the Kuomintang occupation era, we were all here. At that time, how much were the workers worth? Not to mention creation, no one believed that workers could do research. Now the higher authorities are constantly calling on workers to conduct research and creation. To be honest, if the higher authorities hadn't repeatedly said that they weren't afraid of wasting labor and materials, I wouldn't have dared to do it."

　　积极研究发挥创造性

    装制新水车斗成功
    排水量提高三倍节省人力百分之六十
    【新华社华东十五日电】山东博山西河矿区木工张鸿泉、机务工岳鸿庥发挥创造性，装制新水斗车成功，使该矿三号井排水量提高近三倍，且节省人力百分之六十。西河矿井在该地各矿区中水势最大，平时每日涌水三千五百吨，矿内经常以五个井排水，仅以一个井采煤。其中三号井因井筒建设欠佳，只能用牛皮罐打水；但皮罐不能装置自动水门，因此罐到井口，必须有四个工人以长钩把罐打倒水簸箕上，始能放水，排水一罐需时两分钟，其容量只有零点八吨，一昼夜只能排水五百七十余吨。
    西河收复后，矿区公务员即组织机电工人研究改善办法。张鸿泉和岳鸿庥两人，在下班后，就凑到一起积极研究，常常直到深夜。到五月初，他们终于研究出了新水斗车。新水斗车是在井口左右两边铺设铁轨，水斗车分置两边，左车接左罐，右车接右罐（该井以两水罐排水），两车的水斗口都朝水簸箕，水斗车的底板亦向水簸箕倾斜，罐落车上水即自动流出。他们研究出这一办法后，就画出图，请求交机务股制造车轨。当时曾引起许多议论。有人说：“这简直是多费事，我们在某大矿井时也未遇见过。”岳鸿庥后来向记者说：“当时我心里冷了半截，深怕万一不成功，又白搭了工料。”但矿方迅速批准了他们的计划，并说明：“为了鼓励研究创造，即使白搭一部分工料也在所不惜。”
    五月中旬，新水斗车装置起来了，但一试用，水流不出来，主要是水斗车的底斜度不够。张鸿泉非常着急，立即又重钉车底。当时正下雨，他的裤子全湿透了。但重钉车底后，第一小时试验结果，证明完全成功。比较过去，排水一罐由二分钟减至一分又十分之七秒；过去连领班一昼夜需十个捋水工人，现在有四个人（分两班，每班十二小时）就很轻快了。而皮罐容量，因不再靠人力捋罐，由零点八，增为一吨半。一昼夜可排水二千吨以上。
    岳鸿庥向记者谈起这次研究成功时说：“依我说，功劳主要是上级的。韩复渠时代，日寇侵占时代，国民党侵占时代，我们也都在这里，那时工人值几个钱，别说创造，谁也不信工人能研究。现在上级却时时刻刻号召工人进行研究和创造，说实在的，要不是上级口口声声说不怕白搭工料，我早不敢去弄了。”
