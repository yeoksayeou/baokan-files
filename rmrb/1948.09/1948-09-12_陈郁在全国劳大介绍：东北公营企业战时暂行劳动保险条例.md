Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 9th: Chen Yu, head of the Northeast Industrial Department delegation, introduced the draft of the "Northeast Public Enterprise Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations" at the National Labor Congress on the 16th. He pointed out that the labor insurance regulations to be adopted by this congress and proposed to the government are a historically significant document in the Chinese workers' movement. The past five labor congresses have focused on how to struggle against capitalists to win labor insurance benefits; while now, the workers in the liberated areas are studying how to strive to develop production, support the front lines, and establish a rational wartime labor insurance system under the people's regime. He said: In capitalist countries, the labor insurance fund is borne by the workers themselves, and capitalists contribute only a very small portion at most; while in the laws of colonial countries, there is basically no provision for labor insurance, and workers' demands for labor insurance are illegal, and the struggle of workers to win labor insurance will be subject to armed suppression by reactionary rule. In the past 20 years, the Chinese working class has written many heroic struggles in the struggle to win labor insurance benefits. During the Great Revolution of 1925-1927, many victories were won in labor insurance, but they were limited to individual enterprises and industries, and had not yet been clearly stipulated by the state in law. Moreover, after the failure of the Great Revolution, the Kuomintang cancelled or reduced labor insurance benefits in individual enterprises and industries.

　　In contrast to this situation, although the New Democratic government in the liberated areas did not have written legislation on labor insurance in the past, the employees of public factories enjoyed labor insurance benefits. The government is firmly implementing the policy of protecting the interests of workers, especially paying more attention to chemical industry workers, miners, and munitions workers whose physical health is endangered. Appropriate treatment measures are in place for those injured or killed on duty, as well as for sickness, pensions, and maternity allowances for female workers. After this Labor Congress formulates the labor insurance regulations, the labor insurance undertakings in various parts of Northeast China can be unified, forming a system, and can be used as a reference for other liberated areas.

　　Chen Yu then gave a brief explanation of the Northeast Public Enterprise Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations. The draft is divided into: Chapter 1 General Provisions; Chapter 2 Regulations on the Collection and Custody of Labor Insurance Funds; Chapter 3 Various Labor Insurance Undertakings to be Conducted; Chapter 4 Regulations on the Method of Distributing Labor Insurance Funds; Chapter 5 Supervision and Review of Labor Insurance Funds; Chapter 6 Supplementary Provisions. The full text contains 28 articles. Chen Yu pointed out that many of the methods stipulated in the regulations have not yet been achieved in capitalist countries. For example, the standard for the collection of labor insurance funds stipulates that the enterprise contributes 3% of the total wage as the labor insurance fund, and the employees contribute 0.5% of the wage as the labor insurance fund, which shows that the government mainly bears the burden, and the employees only bear a very small part; and the amount borne by the government, if the medical treatment and the wages paid during the injury and illness are included, is about 10% of the total wage, which is quite high as wartime labor insurance. The labor insurance funds of capitalist countries are mainly borne by the workers, who are deducted from their wages. For example, for the living allowance for elderly workers, it is stipulated that elderly employees who are 60 years old and have worked for more than 25 years can enjoy the living allowance. The calculation of seniority is not limited to the enterprise or the national area, so the working time during the puppet Manchukuo period can also be included in the seniority. In capitalist countries, most regulations stipulate that workers can enjoy the benefits at the age of 65 or 50, with 30 to 40 years of service, and are limited to the enterprise and the country. For example, the Kuomintang Beining Railway has only a history of more than 50 years, but the Kuomintang stipulates that only those with 40 years of service can enjoy pensions, and the eight years of service during the Anti-Japanese War are not counted. In fact, the pension benefits are clearly cancelled. For example, the regulations on compensation stipulate that all medical expenses for those injured on duty are borne by the enterprise, and the full wages are paid for the treatment period, limited to six months, which also exceeds the regulations of many capitalist countries.

　　Chen Yu concluded by pointing out that labor insurance is a long-term plan to improve workers' lives and increase production, so it is inseparable from the production system. To truly do a good job in insurance, it is not only a matter of increasing labor insurance funds or improving living conditions, but more importantly, actively adopting new technical conditions, increasing new production equipment, so as to avoid accidents in the production process, reduce the physical and mental consumption of workers, and reduce disease and death. In capitalist countries, the bourgeoisie simply pursues profits and takes a indifferent attitude towards the health and life of workers, and it is impossible to have special equipment to protect the health and safety of workers. Socialist Soviet Union is the most advanced banner of labor insurance in the world. There, employees do not need to pay insurance premiums, which are entirely borne by the enterprise. They are more actively committed to improving machinery and equipment and production technology, so that workers can get safer protection in labor and reduce the occurrence of accidents. The New Democratic Chinese Liberated Areas cannot be immune to many restrictions when running labor insurance undertakings during the war, but these difficulties can be gradually overcome with the victory of the war. He said enthusiastically: "The Soviet Union has made great strides in economic construction and rapid progress in employee labor insurance undertakings due to the strength of the people. I believe that the current liberated areas, as well as the labor insurance undertakings of the liberated China in the future, will certainly be able to make rapid progress."

    东北公营企业战时暂行劳动保险条例
    【新华社东北九日电】东北工业部代表团团长陈郁十六日在全国劳动大会介绍“东北公营企业战时暂行劳动保险条例”草案。他指出此次大会行将通过准备向政府提议的劳动保险条例，是中国职工运动中有历史意义的文献。过去五次劳动大会都是研究如何向资本家作斗争以争取劳动保险利益；而现在解放区的职工是研究在人民政权下，如何努力发展生产，支援前线，并建立合理的战时劳动保险制度了。他说：在资本主义国家劳动保险基金是由工人自己负担，资本家最多也不过是拿出极少一部分；而在殖民地国家的法律里，基本上是没有劳动保险这一条的，工人要求劳动保险是违法的，工人为争取劳动保险的斗争是要遭受反动统治的武装镇压的。中国工人阶级二十余年来在争取劳动保险利益的斗争中，曾写下了许多英勇斗争的史篇。一九二五至一九二七年的大革命时代中，曾在劳动保险上获得了不少胜利，但只限于在个别企业和产业，还没有得到国家在法律上明文规定。而且在大革命失败后，国民党又把个别企业与产业中的劳动保险待遇取消了或降低了。
    与这种情形相反，解放区新民主主义政府过去虽然没有劳动保险的成文立法，但公营工厂的职工，都有劳动保险的待遇。政府是坚决执行保护工人利益政策的，特别是对工人身体健康有危害的化学工业工人、矿工、军火工人等更加注意。对因公受伤或因公死亡的，以及疾病、养老金和女工生育补助金等都有适当待遇办法。这次劳动大会制订出劳动保险条例后，东北各地的劳动保险事业便可趋于统一，形成制度，并可供其他解放区参考。
    陈郁继对东北公营企业战时暂行劳动保险条例，作简略解释。该草案计分：第一章概则；第二章关于劳动保险基金之征集与保管方法规定；第三章应举办之各项劳动保险事业；第四章关于劳动保险基金支配方法之规定；第五章劳动保险基金之监督与审查；第六章附则。全文共二十八条。陈郁指出该条例中所规定之办法，有许多是资本主义国家至今还没有办到的。如在劳动保险金之征集标准中规定由企业方面缴纳等于全部工资的百分之三为劳动保险基金，职工则缴纳工资千分之五的劳动保险金，这说明了主要是由政府负担，职工仅负担极小部分；而政府负担之数量，如将医药治疗及伤病时所付的工资等均计算在内，则约及全部工资百分之十左右，这个数目作为战时劳动保险是相当高的。而资本主义国家的劳动保险基金，主要是由工人担负，从工资中扣收。又如对于老年工人生活补助金，规定老年职工年满六十岁，工龄在二十五年以上者，即可享生活补助金之待遇。工龄之计算并不限定必须在本企业或本国区域之内，因而在伪满时期作工时间，亦得算入工龄之内。而资本主义国家，大都规定在六十五或五十岁，工龄三十年至四十年方可享受，且限制于本企业和本国。如国民党北宁铁路仅有五十余年的历史，而国民党却规定工龄四十年者方得享有养老金，且抗战八年间的工龄又不得计算在内，实际上是明白取消养老金的待遇。再如对于恤金规定因公负伤者之全部医疗费由企业方面负担，并付给治疗期之全部工资，以六个月为限，这也是超过许多资本主义国家规定的。
    陈郁在结语中提出：劳动保险，是改善工人生活，为增加生产作长期打算，因此也是同生产制度分不开的。要真正做好保险事业，就不仅是增加劳动保险基金或改善生活条件，更重要的是积极采取新的技术条件，增加新的生产设备，以避免生产过程中发生事故，减少工人体力脑力的消耗，减少疾病和死亡。资本主义国家，资产阶级单纯追逐利润，对工人健康生命采取漠视态度，不可能为保障工人健康安全而有特殊设备。社会主义的苏联，则是全世界劳动保险事业最先进的旗帜。在那里职工不用缴纳保险费，完全由企业方面负担，他们更积极致力于机器设备和生产技术的改进，使工人在劳动中得到更安全的保障，减少意外事故的发生。新民主主义的中国解放区，在战争时期举办劳动保险事业，不能不受很多限制，但这些困难随着战争的胜利进展是可以逐渐克服的。他热忱地说：“苏联是由人民的力量使经济建设大踏步前进，职工劳动保险事业突飞猛进。相信现在的解放区，以及将来解放了的全中国的劳动保险事业也一定能够很快的进步。”
