[Jizhong Electric] The Raoyang County government, in order to strengthen village financial management, reduce the people's burden, and strive for a balanced and reasonable burden between villages, began to implement county-level unified management of village finances and grain in August. Before the land reform last year, a district-level unified management pilot program was conducted in the First District. The financial and grain resources for half a year were used for three seasons, and it did not become chaotic even until the land reform. In villages without district-level unified management, waste was very serious. Actual expenditures exceeded the required expenditures by one to two times. In Daqianmin Village with 290 households, the regular expenditure from January to July was 1,002 jin of millet, and the extra expenditure was 2,400 jin of millet. Yao Village, with a total of 268 households, spent 346 jin of rice in April alone for regular expenses, and 945 jin for wasteful expenses. Villages that implemented unified management saved much more. For example, in the Northeast Street of the city with 221 households, the total expenditure in March was 181 jin of rice. In Nanguan with 243 households, the expenditure for three months was 450 jin of rice. In July, the Raoyang County government convened a joint meeting of district heads and a financial meeting to discuss the unified management and expenditure issues, and stipulated the future management methods and various systems: (1) Method and Quantity of Unified Management: According to the severity of the disaster before autumn this year, villages were divided into several grades, with appropriate reductions and exemptions. Villages not affected by floods were allocated according to their taxpaying capacity, with a total of three months of unified management. An average taxpaying unit would bear 14.5 liang of millet. Semi-disaster villages would have a 15% reduction. Severely affected villages without wheat harvest and also affected by floods (unable to plant wheat this year) would receive a 50% reduction, with a taxpaying unit contributing 6 liang of millet. (2) Expenditure Items and Expenditure Standards: Four major items were determined: village office expenses, education expenses, Armed Forces Committee office expenses, and miscellaneous expenses. The expenditure standards and quantities should be determined according to the number of households in each village: 250 jin per month for villages with 400 to 500 households, 200 jin per month for villages with 250 to 400 households, 150 jin per month for villages with 150 to 250 households, and 100 jin per month for villages with less than 150 households (80 jin for villages with less than 100 households without teachers). The above expenditure amounts do not include teachers' salaries. (3) To reward savings in expenditure, public and miscellaneous expenses are implemented on a contract basis, and surpluses belong to the village. Each month, a budget is prepared according to the expenditure standards, and villages with surpluses can pay less when submitting unified management grain next time. (4) Management Method: Adopt county-level unified management and district-level administration. The county directly allocates to the village, and each district sets up a "village grain depot" in the resident village, finding a dedicated person to be responsible for issuing grain with vouchers. The depot is opened once a month, and each district reports accounts and submits forms to the county. Miscellaneous expenses account for 35% of the total monthly expenditure (excluding teacher grain), with 15% issued to the village, and the remaining 20% can only be used with district approval, and can also be adjusted and used by the county and district. When adjusting, major expenditures must be reported to the county for approval.

　　饶阳克服浪费减轻民负
  　实行村财粮县统筹
    【冀中电】饶阳县政府为加强村财政管理，减轻人民负担，争取村和村的负担平衡合理，从八月份开始实行村财粮县统筹。去年土改以前，就在一区试办过区统筹，半年的财粮用了三季，直到土改也没混乱了。没由区统筹的村，浪费现象就很严重。实开支超过应开支的一倍到两倍。大迁民庄二百九十户，一月到七月正项开支一千零二斤小米，额外开支二千四百斤小米。姚庄共二百六十八户，光四月份正项开支三百四十六斤米，浪费开支九百四十五斤。实行了统筹的村就节省多了。如城里东北街二百廿一户，三月共开支了一百八十一斤米。南关二百四十三户，三个月开支四百五十斤米。饶阳县政府，在七月里召开了区长联席会和财政会议，讨论了统筹和开支问题，规定了今后管理办法和各种制度：（一）统筹的办法和数量：按照今年秋前灾情轻重分出几等村，适当减免。没受水灾的村，按纳税富力摊派，共统筹三个月的，一个富力平均负担小米十四两半，半灾村减少百分之十五，没麦收又被水灾的重灾村（今年也种不上麦子的），照顾百分之五十，一个纳税富力统筹六两小米。（二）开支科目和开支标准：确定有村公所办公费、教育费、武委会办公费、临时费四大科目。开支标准和数量，要按各村户数多少确定：四百到五百户的，一个月二百五十斤。二百五十户到四百户的村，一个月二百斤。一百五十户到二百五十户的村，一个月开支一百五十斤。一百五十户以下的村，一个月一百斤（一百户以下没教员的村八十斤）。以上开支数目，不包括教员薪金。（三）为奖励节省开支，公杂费采取包干制，节余归村。每月按开支标准填造预算，下次交统筹粮时，节余村可少交。（四）管理办法：采取县统筹区管理。由县直接分配到村，每区在驻村设一个“村粮库”，找出专人负责，凭支票发粮食。一个月开一回库，各区报帐，造表报县。临时费占每月总开支的百分之三十五（不包括教员粮），把百分之十五发到村，剩下的百分之二十，经区批准才能动用，还可以由县区调剂使用，调剂的时候，大项开支得报县批准。
