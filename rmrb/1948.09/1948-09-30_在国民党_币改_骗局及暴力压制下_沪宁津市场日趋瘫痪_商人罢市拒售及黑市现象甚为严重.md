Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Comprehensive reports from various sources indicate that under the reactionary Kuomintang government's implementation of "currency reform" and continued violent suppression, markets in Shanghai and Tianjin are becoming increasingly paralyzed. The phenomena of merchants hoarding, refusing to sell, and black markets are very serious. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on the 5th, in Shanghai, various daily necessities are in short supply, and stores cannot replenish their stock after selling at the "ceiling price," so they have restricted the quantity that each person can purchase. For example, cigarettes are limited to one tin or one box per person, and milk powder is limited to one tin per person. Furthermore, according to a special dispatch from Shanghai carried by the Tianjin Yishibao on the 2nd, "Because various goods exceed the ceiling price, they cannot be officially traded in the market and have mostly gone 'underground.' Currently, paper and silk are the most prevalent in the black market for major commodities, and other goods also mostly exceed the limit. It is said that most of those who deal in gauze in the black market are wealthy families, and the same is true for the stock market." The situation in Tianjin is particularly abnormal. Yarn, cloth, cigarettes, eggs, and meat all have experienced hoarding due to high prices. "Most of the good quality goods are placed on high shelves by daily necessities retailers, and only scattered inferior goods are sold in the market. The phenomenon of evading and refusing to sell is particularly serious, especially for autumn and winter supplies such as woolens and yarn." (7th, Xin Xing Daily) "The situation of customers crowding in cloth shops, silk shops, and department stores is close to a rush. Plain cloth is nowhere to be bought, and cloth shops sell it in scraps of two or three feet." (6th, Ta Kung Pao) The Yishibao on the 10th also reported that "The general price level in Tianjin is still restless, and the black market is rampant."

At the same time, the financial market has also experienced a stagnant phenomenon. In Shanghai, "Credit is loose and abundant, and even a one-yuan daily loan is difficult to release (it was twelve yuan on August 19th)" (2nd, Tianjin Yishibao). This phenomenon even caused an American bank owner to complain: "In the past three weeks, we have done nothing but exchange US dollars for the Chinese government (Kuomintang government).""Companies are paralyzed by terror and everything else, and no one even wants a loan, and if they get a loan, they don't know what to do with it." (Associated Press, 13th) Tianjin is also experiencing "credit looseness" and "even humble words offering low interest rates are met with closed doors" (3rd, Ta Kung Pao).

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: United Press, Shanghai, 20th dispatch: Merchants refuse to continue operating under controlled prices. It is increasingly difficult to hire cars, and most car companies have simply announced a holiday to protest the price freeze at the level of August 19th. The Kuomintang's reactionary "price limit" policy continues to be resisted by merchants and vendors in various places. TASS, Shanghai, 21st dispatch: "Since September 17th, meat has been absent from the Shanghai market. Top-quality rice and flour can no longer be bought in the market." The Associated Press reported on the same day: Shanghai housewives discovered yesterday that the grain market was observing an unscheduled holiday. A few vendors standing behind half-empty stalls gave customers the "strange excuse that a boatload of chickens and pork had sunk." In Nanjing, according to the Kuomintang Central News Agency on the 23rd, members of the Kuomintang Supervisory Yuan also admitted that black market transactions and refusal to sell were very popular in Nanjing, and that "merchants privately increase prices and hoard and conceal daily necessities and refuse to sell them, which is constantly happening."

　　在国民党“币改”骗局及暴力压制下
  　沪宁津市场日趋瘫痪
    商人罢市拒售及黑市现象甚为严重
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】综合各方消息：在国民党反动政府实行“币改”及继续采取暴力压制下，沪、津两地市场日趋瘫痪。商人惜售、拒售及黑市等现象甚为严重。据五日天津大公报讯：上海各种日用品由于求过于供，商店照“限价”售出即无法补进，故已限制每人购买数量。如香烟每人限购一听或一盒，奶粉每人限购一听。又据天津益世报二日载上海专电：“各货因超过限价，无法在市场内正式成交，已多转入“地下”。目前各主要商品，以纸张及丝绸黑市最盛，其他各货亦多逾限。营纱布黑市者，传大部为豪门，股市亦同。”天津市况尤为畸形。纱布、纸烟、鸡蛋、肉类都发生价高惜售的现象。“日用品门市商好货多置之高阁，仅以零星次货应市，尤以秋冬用品呢绒、毛线等，逃避拒售情形甚为严重。”（七日新星报）“各布庄、绸缎店、百货店顾客拥挤情形，近乎抢购。本色市布无处购买，布庄有以二、三尺零块应市者。”（六日大公报）十日益世报则载称：“津市一般物价仍在蠢动，黑市猖獗。”
    同时，金融市场也发生了呆滞现象。上海“银根松滥，日拆一元尚难放出（八月十九日为十二元）”（二日天津益世报）。这种现象甚至使一家美国银行老板也抱怨说：“过去三个星期我们除了给中国政府（国民党政府）换美钞外，什么生意也没有做。”“公司都给恐怖和其他每一件事弄麻痹了，甚至贷款也没有人要了，如果有了贷款他们也不知道用来干什么。”（美联社十三日电）天津也是“银根松泛”，“拆放甚至低利卑辞，仍遭闭门羹”（三日大公报）。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】合众社上海二十日消息：商人拒绝在管制价格下继续营业。雇用汽车日益困难，大部分汽车行为抗议限价冻结在八月十九日上，已干脆宣告放假。国民党的反动的“限价”政策继续受到各地商人和小贩的反抗。塔斯社二十一日上海电称：“自九月十七日起，上海市场即不见肉类。市场上已买不到上等大米与面粉。”同日美联社报导：上海的主妇们昨日发现粮食市场度着一个并非规定的假期。少数站在半空摊子后面的商贩，拿出“有一船小鸡和猪肉沉了的奇怪借口”来应付顾客。在南京，据国民党中央社二十三日电，国民党监察院委员亦承认，南京黑市交易及拒售现象至为流行，“商人私行加价及囤积隐匿日用货品不予出售等事层出不穷”。
