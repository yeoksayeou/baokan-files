Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. The long-prepared war by Indian troops against Hyderabad State broke out on the 13th. According to a TASS dispatch from Delhi on the 13th, "Indian troops have crossed the Hyderabad border in three routes—north, west, and southeast—and have captured the four cities of Balahar, Naldrug, Benmakalu, and Munagala. Indian troops are encountering weak resistance from the Hyderabad army." Note: Hyderabad is one of the largest states in India, located in the south-central part of India, with an area of over 82,000 square miles and a population of over 16 million, making it the most densely populated state in India. Since 1946, there has been a strong peasant movement within Hyderabad, which has liberated over 2,000 villages with a population of five million from the old rule. The entire territory of Hyderabad is surrounded by Hindustan. Since India's partition last year, the Nehru government has insisted that Hyderabad join the Indian Federation, but this has been repeatedly rejected by the King of Hyderabad. Indian progressive newspapers point out that the attitude of the King of Hyderabad is mainly due to the support of British rulers and Pakistan. Due to the stalemate between the Indian and Hyderabad governments, traffic between Hyderabad and the outside world has been blocked by Indian troops in recent months. Prior to this war, the Indian government had demanded that the Hyderabad government disband the Muslim volunteer army "Razakars" and allow Indian troops to be stationed in Hyderabad, but both demands were rejected. On the 10th of this month, Nehru publicly declared that Indian troops would enter Hyderabad regardless of any resistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. The King of Hyderabad State of India issued a ceasefire order on the 17th, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Hyderabad army, El Edroos, surrendered to the Indian Army Commander Chaudhuri on the 18th on behalf of the King of Hyderabad. The King of Hyderabad has accepted the two demands of the Indian government, namely, the re-stationing of Indian troops in Secunderabad in Hyderabad and the disbandment of the Muslim volunteer army "Razakars." The military leader of the "Razakars," Razvi, has been arrested by the Indian army. Chaudhuri has been appointed by the Indian government as the Governor of the military government of Hyderabad.

　　印军攻入海德拉巴土邦
  　海邦王公已向印军投降
    【新华社陕北十八日电】准备已久的印度军队对海德拉巴土邦的战争已于十三日爆发。据塔斯社德里十三日电称，“印军已分北、西、及东南三路越过海德拉巴边境，并已攻占巴拉夏、纳尔德罗格、奔马卡卢及慕纳加拉四城。印军正遭遇着海德拉巴军软弱的抵抗。”按：海德拉巴为印度最大土邦之一，位于印度中部偏南，面积为八万二千余方哩，人口为一千六百余万人，系印度人口最稠密的土邦。一九四六年以来，海德拉巴境内即存在着一个强大的农民运动，曾使拥有五百万人口的两千余乡村从旧的统治之下解放出来。海德拉巴整个领土为印度斯坦所包围。自印度于去年分治以来，尼赫鲁政府曾坚持要求海德拉巴参加印度联邦，但一再为海德拉巴王拒绝。印度进步报纸指出，海德拉巴王的态度，主要是由于英国统治人物及巴基斯坦的支持。由于印海政府之间的僵持，最近数月以来，海德拉巴与外界之交通即为印军封锁。此次战争之前，印度政府曾要求海德拉巴政府解散回教义勇军“拉查卡”并允印军在海邦境内驻扎，但均被拒绝。本月十日，尼赫鲁遂公开宣称，印军将不顾任何抗拒而开入海邦。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】印度海德拉巴土邦王公已于十七日颁发停战令，海邦军队总司令艾德罗斯已于十八日代表海邦王公向印军司令曹德莱投降。海邦王公已接受印度政府之两点要求，即印军重新驻扎海邦之塞孔得拉巴及解散回教义勇军“拉查卡”。“拉查卡”之军事领袖拉兹维已被印军逮捕。曹德莱已被印度政府任命为海邦军政府总督。
