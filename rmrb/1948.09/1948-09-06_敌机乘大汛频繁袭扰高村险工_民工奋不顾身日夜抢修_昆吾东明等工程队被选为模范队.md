Xinhua News Agency, North China, 2nd: In recent days, enemy planes, taking advantage of the emergency of the major flood, have intensified their raids on critical projects such as Gao Village on the south bank of the Yellow River. From the 12th to the 23rd of last month, the Gao Village critical project had already been bombed and strafed five times, resulting in the deaths of civilian laborers Chu Shidun and Li Erxuan, civilian laborer Li Shilang having one leg blown off, and three large material transport boats being destroyed. On the 13th and 15th, the area experienced fierce storms and torrential rains, with huge waves fiercely attacking the embankments, creating an extremely dangerous situation. Enemy planes frequently raided, causing the repair work to be halted, and three sections of the levee below Dam No. 18, totaling over a hundred meters, collapsed. Dam No. 18, which was still under construction, was also almost washed away. At the same time, on the 12th, 16th, and 17th, enemy planes repeatedly raided major critical projects such as Zhukou, Liuzhuang, and Linpu, destroying one of our material transport boats at Jiaoji. At 9:00 PM on the 17th, they strafed Nankai in Fan County for an hour, dropping six bombs, killing and injuring five residents.

Furthermore, residents along the river in Dongming, witnessing engineering teams from various counties braving bombing and strafing by Kuomintang planes, as well as heavy rain, and bravely repairing the Yellow River critical projects day and night, on the 15th specifically brought comfort goods to express their appreciation.

[Ji-Lu-Yu Dispatch] After the Gao Village critical project was turned from danger to safety, on the 24th of last month, all employees involved in the emergency repair conducted a summary of the rescue efforts and elected model engineering teams. The process began with the evaluation of merits and selection of models, preceded by seven days of deliberation and discussion. Everyone unanimously agreed that the Kunwu Engineering Team, under the leadership of Captain Guo Youliang and Instructor Kong Qingzhen, disregarding the enemy situation and the disturbances from planes or the obstruction of wind and rain, consistently adhered to the emergency repair work, demonstrating a heroic and tenacious spirit. During the most critical times of the critical project, they always undertook the most difficult and dangerous engineering tasks of blocking major breaches, and were able to complete their missions. Therefore, they were awarded the First-Class Model Team. Secondly, the Dongming Team and the Shoubei Team were both selected as Second-Class Model Teams. On the evening of the same day, a celebration was held, and the Kunwu Team, amidst thunderous applause, received a model flag with the four large characters "Turned the Tide." In addition to receiving double wages for August, technical personnel and engineering teams from each repair and defense section, as well as all personnel who persisted in the emergency repair work, were each awarded a single layer of clothing and a pair of shoes. The model team members of each team were awarded a towel each.

  　民工奋不顾身日夜抢修
  　昆吾东明等工程队被选为模范队
    【新华社华北二日电】连日来，敌机乘大汛紧急，袭扰黄河南岸高村等险工益剧。自上月十二日至二十三日，高村险工已被轰炸扫射五次，死民工褚石敦、李二玄二人，民工李石朗被炸断一条腿，运料大船被毁三只。十三日及十五日，该地狂风暴雨，洪涛巨浪猛扑堤坝，极为危险，而敌机频繁袭扰，抢修工程时遭停顿，第十八坝以下大堤有三段共百余公尺坍塌。尚未完工之十八坝亦几被冲走。同时十二、十六、十七等日，敌机并多次袭扰朱口、刘庄、临濮等大险工，在焦集毁我运料船一只。十七日午后九时，在范县南开扫射达一小时，投弹六枚，死伤居民五人。
    又讯：东明沿河居民，目睹各县工程队冒国民党飞机轰炸扫射及暴雨，奋不顾身日夜抢修黄河险工，十五日特纷纷携带慰劳品，前往慰劳。
    【冀鲁豫电】高村险工转危为安后，上月二十四日，全体抢险员工进行抢险总结和选举抢险模范工程队。首先进行评功选模，事前经过七天的酝酿讨论，大家一致认为昆吾工程队在队长郭友良和指导员孔庆珍同志领导下，不顾敌情和飞机的扰害或风雨阻难，始终坚持抢险工作，表现了英勇顽强的英雄气概，在险工最危急的时候，都是担任大溜顶冲非常艰险之工程，且能完成任务，因此荣获甲等模范队。其次，东明队及寿北队，均被选为乙等模范队。是日晚，举行庆祝会，昆吾队在掌声雷动中荣获“力转危局”四个大字的模范旗，各修防段的技术人员及工程队，除了八月份奖发双份工资外，各坚持抢险的人员，各奖单衣一身，和鞋子一双。各队的模范队员，每人奖毛巾一条。
