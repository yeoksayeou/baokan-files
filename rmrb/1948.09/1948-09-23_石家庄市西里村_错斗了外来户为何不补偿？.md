　　Xili Village, Shijiazhuang City

Why No Compensation for Wrongfully Accused Outsider?

Comrade Editor:

I have lived in Xili Village, Seventh District, Shijiazhuang City, for eight years. I am now sixty-four years old. I worked in the anti-Japanese resistance since 1939. Later, due to illness, I came to the village (with a letter of introduction from my village district to Xili Village as proof) to treat sores and make a small living as a porter. On September 26th of last year, when the People's Liberation Army arrived in the village, Bai Ernian (who served as a railway guard for the Japanese-controlled South Manchuria Railway in the old years) hid in the courtyard where I lived. The district cadre came to the village, and Bai Ernian and his elder brother Bai Danian (who worked as a staff member for the Japanese-controlled South Manchuria Railway in the old years) became village cadres (Danian as director of the Armed Forces Committee, Ernian as a public security officer). They conspired with the wife of Wang Dezi, who lived in the same courtyard as me (who owed me wages and 67 jin of millet that I should have received for my work as a porter, which he didn't want to give me), to falsely accuse me of being a person to be struggled against. First, they confiscated 103 jin of salt that I used for business (including the bags). District cadre Lao An (who lived in the village and led the work) instructed Bai Ernian to threaten me not to give me a confiscation receipt and put the hat of a fleeing landlord/struggled-against household on me, and threatened me as a Guomindang spy. On the thirteenth day of the twelfth lunar month last year, on a day of heavy snow, the village cadres forcibly drove me out of the village and completely confiscated the materials I had worked hard to acquire. After my family of three returned to my home village, my village cadres, after hearing my description of the village's illegal methods, immediately gave me a letter of introduction, proving that I was not a rich peasant, let alone a landlord, and that I was indeed working in the anti-Japanese resistance and recovering from illness in Shijiazhuang. The Sixth District of Longyao County also sent a letter to the village to negotiate for the return of my materials. On December 27th, I took a letter of introduction from the village district to the village and asked District Cadre Lao An to return my materials. After reading the letter, Lao An told me to negotiate with the village cadres, and the village cadres told me to ask Lao An, passing the buck back and forth. Village cadre Liu Jitang insisted that I was a person who should be struggled against and would not return my materials, saying that the letter of introduction was fake. I told them to communicate with my home village district for investigation, and if it was fake, I would gladly accept the punishment. Bai Shuangxi shouted loudly, "If you don't leave, and say any more, we'll detain you for a few days and execute you!" I had no choice but to return to my home village and report the true situation in the village to the Sixth District of Longyao. The Sixth District and my home village again wrote letters to the municipal government. On the fourteenth day of the first lunar month, I took the district and village letters to the municipal government. On the eighth day of the second lunar month, the municipal government told me that they had sent people to the village twice, and the village cadres had agreed to return the materials in full, and instructed me to go to the village to collect them. On the tenth day, I went to the village again, and Lao An instructed the village cadres to tell me that the salt had been divided up and eaten, the foreign cloth had been divided up and used, the coat was worn by someone, the student clothes were given to someone, and all the valuable things were gone, refusing to give them to me, prevaricating and stalling. He also said: The city doesn't care about the district, the district doesn't care about the village, if the village doesn't give it to you, no one can do anything. I went to the municipal government again, and they told me to wait a few days. After waiting a few days, I ran out of money and had to return to my home village again. When I left, I asked the municipal government to negotiate with the village, and if there were any results, to instruct me to go to Shijiazhuang again, but I have not received any news so far. I am now in such poverty that I have no way to do anything, and I cannot go to Shijiazhuang. My list of materials and supporting documents are all in Shijiazhuang. How should the materials detained by Xili Village now be handled? Can they be returned to me? I know that the newspaper office is the place to solve the people's suffering. Please advise by letter.

　　石家庄市西里村
  　错斗了外来户为何不补偿？编辑同志：
    我在石家庄市第七区西里村住居八年，现在六十四岁，自民国二十八年作抗日工作，后因病到该村（有原籍村区给西里村介绍信证明）治疮做小买卖当夫度日。至去年九月二十六日解放军到该村时，该村白二年（旧年给日寇满铁当护路队）避在我住的院里，区干到该村，白二年与其胞兄白大年（旧年给日寇满铁当职员）当了村干（大年当武委会主任、二年当公安员）与我同院王德子（欠我工钱及我当夫应得的六十七斤小米对到他身上他不想给我）之妻同谋，诬我是被斗户，先没收我作买卖食盐百零三斤（连口袋）。区干老安（常住该村领导工作）指示白二年威胁我不给开没收条，给戴上逃亡地主被斗户的帽子，并以国特威胁。村干于去年阴历十二月十三日天降大雪之日，硬将我赶出该村，将我劳力经营的物资完全扣留。我老小三口回我本村后，我村村干听我述说该村这样办法不合法令，即给我开介绍信，证明我不是富农，更非地主，确是作抗日工作养病赴石。隆尧县第六区亦开信向该村交涉，使其交还我物资。十二月二十七日带村区介绍信至该村，向区干老安要求还我物资，老安看信后，令我向村干交涉，村干令向老安要求，互相推诿。村干刘计堂硬说我是被斗户，不还我的物资，并说介绍证明信是假的。我叫他们向我原籍村区通信调查，倘是假的，我甘当罪。白双喜即大声喊说：“你若不走，再说，将你禁闭几天，把你枪决！”我不得已再回原籍，向隆尧六区报告在该村经过实情，六区及本村又给向市政府写信，我拿信于正月十四日又至该村，向老安村干要求。老安说你的食盐已分吃了，物资分用了。当面问二年说：都完了吗？二年说：“并未动用，完全存着。”这明是老安从中作梗，白双喜硬将给市政府的信扣留，我又回原籍，六区令我带信直呈市政府。二月初四日又向市政府呈上区村信件，初八日市政府对我说：已派人至该村两次，其村干已允将物资原数交还，令我到该村领取。初十日再到该村，老安指示村干对我说：食盐分吃了，洋布分用了，大衣某人穿了，学生衣给了某人，凡值钱东西都完了，硬不给我，搪塞支吾。他并言：市不管区，区不管村，村中不给你，谁也没办法。我即再至市政府，令我等几天，等了几天，盘费用尽，只得又回原籍。走时请市政府与该村交涉，有结果时指示我再赴石家庄，至今未得音信。我现在穷的半点办法无有，我也去不了石家庄，我的物资清单、证明文件都在石家庄。现在西里村扣留我的物资应如何处理？能否归还我？知道报馆是解决群众痛苦的，请来信指示。
