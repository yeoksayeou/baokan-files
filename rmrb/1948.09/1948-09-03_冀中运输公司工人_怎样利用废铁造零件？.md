　　How Did Workers at Jizhong Transportation Company Use Scrap Iron to Make Parts?
To the Editor:
　　I read a news item on the lower right corner of page two of the People's Daily on July 27th: "Jizhong Transportation Company auto workers Yu Haiquan and others used scrap iron to manufacture automobile parts such as hooks, hook shaft expansion rings, and rubber cloth, which are of better quality than foreign goods, and the finished products are also half the price of foreign goods." Such a spirit of creation is truly admirable. However, there is no detailed explanation of the manufacturing process of these parts, the quality standards in use, and how many kilometers they can actually travel. Because we are also engaged in the research and manufacture of such parts, we are very willing to exchange experiences with them and learn from comrades like Yu Haiquan. Please forward our sincere opinions to them, and we hope that they will send us the specific details of the manufacturing process of these parts, and also provide us with their mailing address for contact.

　　冀中运输公司工人
  　怎样利用废铁造零件？编辑同志：
    读到人民日报七月二十七日第二版右下角消息一则：“冀中运输公司汽车工人于海泉等，利用废铁，制造勾贝、勾贝轴涨圈、胶布等汽车零件，比外来货质量还好，成品也比外货低一倍。”象这类创造精神，实堪敬佩。不过对于该项零件的制造过程情形，及使用上的质量标准，实际能行驶多少里程？没有详细说明。因为我们今天也是正在从事研究制造这类零件的工作，所以我们极愿和他们交流经验，并向于海泉等同志学习。我们这点诚恳的意见，请编辑同志转给他们。并望他们把制造这些零件详细过程的具体情况函示，同时请把他们的通讯地点赐告，以资联系。
