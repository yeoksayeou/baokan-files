Students in the Kuomintang-controlled Areas
　　Persist in Struggle Amidst Persecution
    △ According to a United Press report from Shanghai on August 28th, the "Student News," a mimeographed publication of the "Shanghai Student Federation," which persists in underground struggle, revealed that more than 20 students in Kunming were tortured to death in concentration camps, and more than 100 are missing. On August 15th, when Kuomintang military police in Kunming besieged patriotic students participating in the movement against the US policy of supporting Japanese aggression against China, in addition to shooting and wounding more than 150 students on the spot with rifles and machine guns, they also arrested 400 to 500 students, of whom 337 were sent to the summer camp, a disguised concentration camp, for "training."
    △ According to a TASS report on August 9th, citing the Nanjing Central University Weekly, Li Hongbang (transliteration), a student of Central University, was arrested on his way from Chongqing to Chengdu. The report stated that two secret agents and three armed soldiers found a Chinese translation of a selected collection of works by the old Russian writer Pushkin in the student's luggage. They did not even know Pushkin's name, but when they found a reference to the Soviet Union in the preface of the book, they immediately arrested the student.
    △ More than 160 students from major universities and middle schools in Shenyang lined up and went to the Shenyang Enemy Garrison Command on the morning of August 10th to petition, protesting the atrocities of arresting Wang Wenyan, assistant teacher of Shenyang Medical College, and Qi Yulin and other five students of the Teachers College, demanding unconditional release, and sang anti-persecution tunes in front of the department until they dispersed at 5 pm.
    △ On August 4th, a large number of military police of the Chiang and Fu bandit gang in Beiping suddenly surrounded Changbai Normal College and the Northeast Provisional Middle School dormitory, and arrested Ma (character not clear) and other 18 people, cadres of the Changbai Normal College Student Union. Northeast University and seven other universities and colleges in Ping expressed serious protest against this.
    △ Zhou Xiangsheng, a female student of the Engineering College of Peking University in Beiping, was kidnapped by plainclothes agents and taken to a nearby police station when she stepped out of the school gate on August 4th. Just as the agents were about to call for a car, she was discovered and rescued by a professor from the college.
