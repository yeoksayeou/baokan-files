Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd – The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued a notice on helping military families with the autumn harvest and resolving the production and living difficulties of military families. It stipulates that all localities must pay attention to helping military families lacking labor and families of civilians serving at the front to carry out the autumn harvest, ensuring timely harvesting, and organizing them for all-season production. The notice emphasizes that all district and township Party organizations, Communist Party members, government, and Party groups in cooperatives should earnestly and responsibly help military families solve difficulties in production and life. It also points out that special care should be given to families of martyrs and those with particularly severe labor shortages and production and living difficulties. Resolutely correct the erroneous thinking and practices of favoring workers' families more than military families, and the so-called "favoritism based on personal relationships." At the same time, patiently persuade and educate military families, mobilize them to participate in all possible productive labor, and make them understand that it is even more glorious for sons and husbands to kill the enemy at the front, while parents and wives are production models in the rear. Overcome some backward ideas of only waiting for preferential treatment and not engaging in production, so that all military families can establish themselves and make a living through their own hard work and the help of the masses.
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 24th – All parts of Jin-Sui are strengthening the work of providing preferential treatment to military families through farming assistance, helping the families of new soldiers who have recently joined the army with production. County-level cadres in Shenfu County personally went to the homes of military families to check and solicit opinions on preferential treatment work. The representative meeting of Xixiangwang Village in Lishi convened a meeting of young men joining the army to jointly determine methods for providing preferential treatment through farming assistance. Cadres in Zhuhua Village took the lead in working in the fields with the substitutes and checking on the spot. Pengfengshan Village formed several farming assistance teams, each led by a cadre to ensure that the military families' crops were carefully and efficiently cultivated. Xuejiapo Village also established an evaluation system for the quality of farming assistance. Each village in Lin County has established a Military Support Committee or Military Support Team. In Sanjiao Village, more than a hundred Party members, cadres, and militiamen helped 32 military martyrs' families to go to the fields for production. When the new soldier Zhang Guilin returned home to visit, he was very happy to see this and returned to his unit. All localities have also begun to pay attention to organizing women from military martyrs' families to participate in agricultural production. According to the inspection by the Women's Representative Conference in the Second District of Xing County, most women in mountainous areas are participating in agricultural production, and women in riverine areas are also participating.

　　东北帮助军属收秋
  　晋绥加强优军代耕
    【新华社东北二十二日电】中共中央东北局顷发出关于帮助军属秋收与解决军属生产生活困难的通知。规定各地必须注意帮助缺乏劳动力的军属与服务前方的民工家属进行秋收，保证按时收割，并组织他们进行各季生产。通知着重指出一切区、乡党的组织、共产党员、政府与合作社的党组，都应认真负责，帮助军属解决生产中与生活中的困难。并指出：对于烈属与特别缺乏劳动力，生产与生活困难的，尤应多予照顾。坚决纠正那种工属优待多，军属优待少，及所谓“人在人情在”的错误思想和做法。同时应耐心说服教育军属，动员他们参加一切可能的生产劳动，使他们懂得：儿子丈夫在前方杀敌，父母妻子在后方做生产模范是更加光荣的。克服某些只等优待，不事生产的落后思想，使全体军属都能在自己的努力生产与群众的帮助下，安家立业。
    【新华社晋绥二十四日电】晋绥各地正加强优军代耕工作，帮助最近参军的新战士家属生产。神府县级干部亲自到各军属家检查和征询对优军工作的意见。离石西相王村代表会，召开参军青年会议，共同确定优军代耕办法。该次朱化村干部作带代耕人下地作活，就地检查。鹏凤山村编成若干代耕小组，每组都有干部领导，保证军属庄稼作务得细致省工。薛家坡村并成立对代耕好坏的评议制度。临县各村皆成立优军委员会或优军小组。该县三交村党员、干部和民兵百余人，帮助三十二户军烈属下地生产，新战士张贵林回家探望，见此情景，非常高兴地归队。各地亦开始注意组织军烈属妇女参加农业生产。据兴县二区妇女代表会检查，山地大部妇女均参加农业生产，川地妇女也有参加的。
