　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, August 31st: Chen Xie's army held a rally in a city on the front lines on August 23rd to celebrate the anniversary of crossing the Yellow River on the southern expedition and advancing into Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei. On this day last year, the army first crossed the Yellow River and entered western Henan. In the past year, they have established liberated areas in western Henan and southern Shaanxi, liberating the broad masses of the people. On that day, national flags were hung all over the city, and a dozen Yangko teams appeared on the streets, with drums and music filling the air. The anniversary meeting also held an exhibition of the achievements of the past year's victories, which was extremely crowded with spectators. The exhibition charts explained that Chen Xie's army had annihilated 130,000 Kuomintang troops in the past year, captured 17 Kuomintang generals, captured 51 cities, and liberated nearly 10 million people. Generals Chen Geng and Xie Fuzhi personally attended the meeting, and the audience cheered like thunder when they entered. At the beginning of the meeting, Chief of Staff General Wang Qiming explained the victorious situation of the Central Plains Liberated Area in front of a large map. Then, Director of the Political Department General Liu Youguang gave a report. He pointed out that the reasons for the victory in the past year were: First, the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's great strategic policy of pushing the war into the Kuomintang-controlled areas; second, the powerful cooperation of Liu Deng and Chen Su's advance into the Central Plains and the three major field armies; third, the correct leadership of Chen Xie's leaders, the efforts of all commanders and fighters, and the support of the people of western Henan. He said: In the past year, we have not only learned to fight, but also initially learned to mobilize the masses and manage cities. He called on everyone not to be arrogant and complacent, but to more bravely annihilate the enemy, completely liberate the Central Plains, and continue to push the war into the Kuomintang-controlled areas; and to better learn to implement the Party's policies, implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, and overcome certain undisciplined and unorganized tendencies. Finally, the congress passed a message of greetings to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the leaders of the Central Plains Military Region, and the Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China in North China.
