　　【Taiyue News】The Kuomintang officers (with a small number from Zhang Lan Town in Jiexiu) who laid down their weapons in large numbers on the Linfen battlefield in May this year were concentrated in the Taiyue People's Liberation Army Officer Training Regiment for short-term education. Now, most of them have been released. They were moved by the truth and saw that the Kuomintang's rule was about to end. Therefore, they quickly realized that they had been deceived by the Kuomintang rulers in the past and were ready to become new people. For example, Li Zhenting, the regimental commander of the "Tiger Regiment" of the 72nd Division of the Yan Xishan army, was ill when he was first captured and brought to the regiment. We treated him as a friend and gave him good medical care. Soon, his illness improved, and he was very moved. He immediately called on the officers of the "Tiger Regiment" who had been captured with him to put down their ideological baggage, tell the truth to the People's Liberation Army, and provide detailed information about their true ranks, real names, and true histories. He also said with great indignation: "Yan Xishan is a real traitor. I personally witnessed and participated in the Anping meeting with the Japanese invaders in 1943, and the collaboration between the 62nd Army and the Japanese invaders in southeastern Shanxi to jointly suppress the Eighth Route Army. There will be no good end to following him. I am over fifty years old this year and have been working for him all my life. In name, I am a regimental commander of the 'Tiger Regiment,' but in reality, I don't even have a horse to ride. The lame, brownish-yellow mule that I often ride was borrowed from a friend. I have decided to go home (to the liberated area) and do my best for the people." There are many such examples. Starting in mid-August, they were sent back to their places of origin. Those who have already been sent back include Wei Shaoren, a Kuomintang army major battalion commander of the 30th Brigade, Liu Yingjie, a major deputy battalion commander, Cai Shengxun, Li Zhenting, a colonel regimental commander of the "Tiger Regiment" of the Yan Xishan army's 72nd Division, Zhang Ru, a colonel deputy commander of the Jinan Garrison Area, and Guo Wei, a major press officer of the 66th Division, and other officers (with a small number of soldiers), totaling 963 people. Before their departure, they were given a rich farewell banquet and a warm send-off, provided with sufficient travel expenses, and all their stored belongings were returned to them. Many of them were moved to tears and expressed their heartfelt gratitude. For example, Chen Hanshou, a warrant officer of the 30th Brigade, said: "I thought the watch you kept for me was broken long ago, but I didn't expect you to return it to me this time, and it still works well." Shi Guoquan, a soldier of the 27th Brigade, said: "The money you kept for me was returned to me without even changing the numbers. It's really rare!" In particular, Chen Yueqiao, a lieutenant deputy platoon leader of the 38th Division, and Yu Mingshan, a soldier of the First Army Headquarters, were both members of the Hui Muslim community. We took care of their Muslim lifestyle habits in their daily lives and allowed them to slaughter their own sheep and prepare their own food during the banquet. They were very grateful and said: "We have never seen such care for us in the Kuomintang army for more than ten years. We will never forget the Communist Party."

　　临汾战役被俘军官经过教育大部遣散
    【太岳讯】今年五月在临汾战场大批放下武器的蒋阎军官（有一少部是介休张兰镇来的），集中太岳解放军官教导团短期教育后，现已大部遣散。他们受到真理的感召，看到蒋阎统治快要完蛋，因此很快觉悟到过去受了蒋阎统治者的欺骗教育，准备再作新人。例如阎军七十二师老虎团团长李震廷，初被解放来团时，身上有病，我方拿他当朋友看待，给他好好的疗养，不久他的病好了，他很感动，立即号召同时被解放的老虎团军官，放下思想包袱，对解放军说实话，把他们一伙十多个军官的真级职、真名姓、真历史，都详细说出来。他又很愤激的说：“阎锡山真是汉奸，三十二年和日寇在安平会议，六十二军在汾东勾结日寇共同扫荡八路军，这些事我都亲眼见过，也参加过。跟他搞有什么下场，象我今年有五十多岁，跟他干了一辈子，名义上是个老虎团长，实际连一匹乘马也没有，我经常骑的那茶色跛脚骡子，还是朋友借给我的。我决定要回家（解放区），为人民尽一点力。”这样例子是很多的，从八月中旬开始遣送他们各回原籍，计已遣送者，有蒋军三十旅少校营长魏绍仁、少校副营长刘英杰、蔡圣训，阎军七十二师老虎团上校团长李震廷、晋南团管区上校副司令张儒、六六师少校新闻干事郭伟等军官（有少数士兵）九百六十三名。临别时对他们举行了丰盛的会餐，与热烈的欢送，发给足够的路费，并归还每个人存放的财物。他们很多人都感动的流泪，说出衷心感激的话来，如三十旅准尉特务长陈汉收说：“你们替我保存的手表，我以为早坏了，想不到这次还给我，仍然走得好好的。”二十七旅士兵施国权说：“替我保存的票子，发还我连号码也没有掉换一下，真难得！”特别是卅八师中尉副连长陈月樵，第一军军部士兵余明山等都是回教教胞，日常照顾他们回教的生活习惯，会餐时让他们自己杀羊，自己弄来吃，他们很感激的说：“象这样照顾我们，在国民党部队干了十多年也没有见过一回，我们永远忘不了共产党。”
