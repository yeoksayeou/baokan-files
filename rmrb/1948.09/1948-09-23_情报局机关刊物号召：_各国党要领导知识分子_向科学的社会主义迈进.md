　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 19th. A dispatch from Telepress Bucharest: The magazine "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy," published on September 15th, points out that working among intellectuals is one of the main tasks of the Communist Party. The publication states: The experience of intellectuals actively and bravely fighting against fascist aggression alongside the working class in recent years has led ideologically progressive figures in the scientific and cultural fields into the democratic and anti-imperialist camp. Today, progressive intellectuals constitute a considerable force among millions of peace, progress, and democracy fighters. This was clearly demonstrated at the Wroclaw Congress for the Defense of Peace and Culture. The decisions of the Wroclaw Congress place significant and glorious tasks before the Communist Parties of all countries, especially those in the countries led by the Communist Party, namely, to organize and lead the intellectuals in their respective countries in the defense of peace and culture. The publication demands that the Communist Party should pay more attention to the work of intellectuals and train them in the spirit of the most progressive Marxist-Leninist scientific thought. Naturally, those intellectuals who participate in or lean towards the Communist Party inevitably carry a certain burden of bourgeois ideology and prejudices. They must be helped in various ways to eliminate the remnants of bourgeois ideology and prejudices, and be firmly led to advance towards scientific socialism. Working among intellectuals requires thoughtful consideration and careful deliberation in solving and handling problems; but this does not mean that the Communist Party should tolerate those who verbally acknowledge the communist worldview but are actually tools of bourgeois ideology, or tolerate those who still maintain a so-called independent and non-partisan stance in their actual work.

　　情报局机关刊物号召：
    各国党要领导知识分子
  　向科学的社会主义迈进
    【新华社陕北十九日电】电通社布加勒斯特讯：九月十五日出版的“争取持久和平与人民民主”杂志指出，在知识分子当中进行工作，是共产党的主要任务之一。该刊称：近几年来，知识分子与工人阶级一道积极与勇敢地进行反法西斯侵略的斗争之经验，将科学与文化界思想前进的人士引导到民主与反帝国主义阵营中。今天，进步的知识分子，在千百万和平、进步与民主战士当中构成一支相当大的力量。这在保卫和平与文化的罗克劳大会上得到了明显的证明。罗克劳大会的决定，使各国共产党特别是共产党领导的国家，面临着重大而光荣的任务，这就是在保卫和平与文化当中组织及领导其国内的知识分子。该刊要求共产党应该更多的注意对知识分子的工作，本着最进步的马列主义科学思想之精神去训练他们。自然，参加或倾向共产党的那些知识分子，当然带有资产阶级思想意识与偏见的某种负担，必须以各种办法帮助他们涤除资产阶级思想意识与偏见的残余，并坚定地领导他们向科学的社会主义迈进。在知识分子当中工作，对问题的解决和处理需要深思熟虑与谨慎周密；但这并不是说共产党应该宽容那些口头上承认共产主义世界观而实际上仍为资产阶级思想意识之工具的人们，或宽容那些在其实际工作中依然保留所谓独立及无党派立场的人们。
