Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th. A certain unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army used democratic reasoning methods to educate a deserter, Xue Taigui, and also examined shortcomings in the leadership methods of the company cadres. Xue is 18 years old, from Jiang County, Shanxi Province, a peasant who was emancipated. Before joining the army, he participated in the farmers' association and the militia, and supported the front lines with the army. He voluntarily joined the army last November and was assigned to a certain company of the unit this March. On June 15th, he deserted. When the squad leader brought him back, he said, "Squad leader, I made a mistake, but I want to reason." At that time, a comrade from the brigade political department who was sent to the company to help work talked with him, comforted him, and guided him to speak his mind. It turned out that on the third day Xue arrived at the company, he was called out by the company commander and asked to self-criticize in front of everyone because he sang during exercises. Once, when he was sick, he asked for leave from the drill ground, but the instructor rebuked him without asking the reason, saying, "You just came down casually. You've only been a soldier for a few days and you're already getting mischievous." This caused him great embarrassment. Once, when the whole company took apart and washed cotton-padded clothes, he went to wash after guarding the post, but everyone had finished washing and assembled. He asked to stay and finish washing, but the squad leader did not allow it, and criticized him at the criticism meeting. The company commander also said in front of the team that he was a "lazybones." On the evening of June 14th, when the squad leader held a squad meeting, he severely criticized him and two other soldiers, saying that they were not united and that there must be a saboteur among them. In this way, he felt both wronged and afraid, so he deserted this dawn.
After learning about the above situation, the comrades of the brigade political department and the battalion political department believed that the leadership should also bear great responsibility for Xue's desertion. This exposed serious oversimplification problems in the leadership style of the company cadres. It was decided to let everyone democratically discuss Xue's desertion issue in order to educate everyone and improve the cadres. First, a meeting of cadres above the squad level was convened to study how to deal with it. At the beginning, some cadres advocated punishing Xue Taigui, but after clarifying the facts, everyone believed that Xue, a liberated peasant who had been trained by the militia, should be an excellent member of the People's Liberation Army. Because he had just arrived in the army, lacked war experience, was not accustomed to discipline and life, and was not proficient in his movements, the cadres provided little help and education to him, but much reprimand, and even mistakenly suspected him of being a saboteur, which led him to desert out of disappointment. Therefore, everyone at the cadre meeting agreed that a soldier like Xue should be educated, and also recognized the shortcomings in the leadership style. Then, a general meeting of all soldiers in the company was held, and Xue reported his thoughts on desertion. Everyone then launched a democratic discussion and mutual criticism. The company cadres made a solemn self-criticism to the whole group for not going deep into the masses of soldiers in the past, not understanding, and therefore not being able to understand Xue's thoughts and emotions, so that there was little help and education, but much criticism. At the same time, it was sternly pointed out that Xue had the mistake of not raising opinions to the leadership and of deserting. Under the influence of the general meeting, Xue Taigui further reflected on his own wrong ideas such as fearing war and homesickness. He also expressed his determination to correct himself, to study hard in training, and to be a people's soldier.

### 西北某部结合实例进行教育　民主处理逃亡问题

　　西北某部结合实例进行教育
  　民主处理逃亡问题
    【新华社西北十二日电】西北人民解放军某部用民主说理方法，教育开小差的战士薛太贵，并检查了连队干部中领导方法上的缺点。薛年十八岁，山西绛县人，翻身农民，参军前曾参加农会和民兵，曾随军支前，去年十一月自动参军，今年三月才补到该部某连，六月十五日开小差逃跑。当班长追回他时，他说：“班长，我犯了错误，但我要讲道理。”当时旅政治部派往该连帮助工作的同志就和他谈话，安慰他，引导他讲出了心里的话。原来薛到该连的第三天，就因在上操时唱歌，被连长把他叫出来要他在大家面前检讨。有一次他病了，从操场请假下来，指导员不问情由就训责他说：“随便下来，当兵几天就调皮了。”这给他很大难堪。某次全连拆洗棉衣，他放哨后才去洗时，大家已洗完集合，他要求留下洗完，班长不许，并在检讨会上批评他，连长又在队前说他是“懒虫”。六月十四日晚上，班长开班务会时又狠狠地批评了他和另外两个战士，说他们不团结，当中一定有个破坏分子。这样，他心里既觉委屈，又加害怕，这天黎明就开了小差。
    旅政治部工作同志及大队政治处了解以上情况后，认为薛的逃跑，领导上也应负很大责任。这暴露了连队干部领导作风上有严重的简单化毛病。乃决定将薛的逃跑问题让大家民主讨论，以教育大家，提高干部。首先召开了班以上干部会研究如何处理，开始时有的干部主张惩办薛太贵，但经弄清事实后，大家都认为象薛这样的翻身农民，又经过民兵的锻炼，应该是解放军的优秀成员。由于初到部队，缺乏战争锻炼，对纪律生活不习惯，动作不熟练，干部对他帮助少，教育少，责备却多，甚至错误地怀疑他是破坏分子，致使他因失望而开小差。因此干部会上大家都同意对薛这样的战士应该教育，同时也认识了领导作风上的缺点。于是召开全连军人大会，由薛报告了开小差思想，大家就展开了民主讨论和互相批评。该连干部就向全体严肃地自我批评了因过去不深入战士群众，不了解同时也就不能体贴薛的思想情绪，以致帮助教育少，苛责批评多，同时也严正指出了薛有意见不向领导上提，和开小差的错误。薛太贵在大会感动下进一步反省了自己也有害怕战争和想家等错误思想。并表示决心改正，要在练兵中好好学习，作一个人民战士。
