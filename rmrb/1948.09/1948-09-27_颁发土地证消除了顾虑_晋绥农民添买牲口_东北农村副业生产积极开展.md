　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 21st -- Farmers in the Jin-Sui liberated areas are purchasing large numbers of livestock in preparation for winter production and next year's large-scale production, as the government issues land certificates and confirms land rights. In recent months, Hequ County has imported over 1,000 head of livestock from Mongolia, and imports are continuing steadily. In the past three months, Xinjiang County in southern Shanxi has also purchased over 1,000 head of livestock. The county also lent 1,000 dan of grain and converted the gold and silver from the fruits of struggle in various places into cash, which was then lent by the farmers' association to farmers lacking livestock to help them purchase livestock.
    In order to protect and encourage the increase of livestock, all areas are now strictly enforcing the Border Region Administrative Office's order to protect cattle. Aiming at farmers' concerns that cattle rights are not consolidated, the Yanbei Fifth District decided to determine cattle rights and issue cattle certificates at the same time as determining land rights. During the spring plowing season, Shuoxian County transferred cattle shares and issued unequal immediate exchange, and even free use rights, resulting in farmers being unwilling to feed livestock. Therefore, the county recently instructed all villages to resolutely supplement cattle prices and implement the principle of voluntary and equivalent exchange during autumn plowing.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th -- Rural areas in the Northeast liberated areas are widely developing sideline production. In Tailai County, Nenjiang Province, due to the influence of land evaluation and land allocation, farmers have dispelled concerns about land rights and production, and are more actively engaged in sideline production. Farmers in five districts of the county have collected 93.5 million catties of firewood and grass. In addition to exchanging it for millet and bean cake, they have also bought horses and carts. Dayushu Village alone bought 34 horses and 52 carts. The masses in the Sanchahe District of Fuyu earned 870 million yuan from collecting grass and weaving baskets, and have now bought back 675,900 catties of grain. Farmers in five districts, including Mao'ershan in Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, earned over 90 million yuan from pulling planks, making axe handles, and women's spinning and weaving in 20 days, solving the problem of food and winter clothing during the lean season, and bought 121 horses. The masses in Saima County, Andong Province, which suffered from famine, organized transportation and have transported 1,666,600 catties of grain; ＠yang, Shuangshan and other districts have all solved the food shortage. The masses in Jining and Hada Districts, Hejiang Province, earned 200 million yuan from collecting firewood and grass in 11 days. In addition to solving their own firewood and grass needs, they also earned 92.75 million yuan, which can be used to add winter clothing and for pocket money.

　　颁发土地证消除了顾虑
  　晋绥农民添买牲口
    东北农村副业生产积极开展
    【新华社晋绥廿一日电】晋绥解放区农民在政府颁发土地证并确定地权过程中，大量购买牲畜，准备冬季生产和明年大生产。河曲县近月来已自蒙古输入牲畜千余头，现仍源源输入。晋南新绛县最近三月内亦购进牲畜千余头。该县并曾贷粮一千大石，及将各地斗争果实中的金银兑成现款，由农会贷给缺牲畜农民，帮助他们购买牲畜。
    为保护与奖励增加牲畜，各地现皆严格执行边区行署保护耕牛令。雁北五分区针对农民害怕牛权不巩固的顾虑，决定在确定地权同时，确定牛权，颁发耕牛证。朔县在春耕期间，调牛犋，曾发放了不等立即换，甚至无代价使用权限，致农民不愿喂牲口，因此该县近特指示各村坚决补充牛价，并在秋耕中执行自愿及等价交换原则。
    【新华社东北二十日电】东北解放区农村正广泛开展副业生产。嫩江省泰来县由于评地发地照的影响，农民解除对地权及生产等的顾虑，更加积极从事副业生产。该县五个区农民打柴草九千三百五十万斤，除换谷子、豆饼外，并买马置车，仅大榆树村即买马三十四匹，买车五十二辆。扶余三岔河区群众打草编筐获利八亿七千余万元，现已买回粮食六十七万五千九百斤。松江省尚志县帽儿山等五个区农民，二十天内拉木板、做镐把及妇女纺织等获利九千余万元，解决了青黄不接的吃粮及冬衣问题，并买马一百二十一匹。遭受灾荒的安东省赛马县群众组织运输，已运进粮食一百六十六万六千斤；＠阳、双山等区，都解决了粮荒。合江省鸡宁、哈达区群众打柴草，十一天获利两亿元，除解决自用柴草外，尚赚九千二百七十五万元，可添加冬衣及作零用。
