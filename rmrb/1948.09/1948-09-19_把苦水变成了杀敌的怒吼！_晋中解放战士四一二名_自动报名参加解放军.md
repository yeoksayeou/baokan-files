Turning Bitter Water into a Roar of Anger to Kill the Enemy!
412 Liberated Soldiers in Jinzhong Voluntarily Enlist in the People's Liberation Army

[Jinzhong Electric] The first batch of 412 Yan's army soldiers liberated by a certain unit on the Jinzhong front have signed up to join the People's Liberation Army. They were peasants who were forcibly conscripted or captured by the Yan bandits last winter and this spring, and were liberated in successive battles such as Jiajiazhuang in Xiaoyi and Nanbeiqi in Wenshui. When they saw the democratic freedom and good life with food and clothing in the liberated areas, they recalled the painful situation in the Yan-occupied areas and the Yan bandit army. Coupled with their personal experience of our army's lenient policy, they were deeply moved and quickly awakened. In a team of 246 people, 58 people declared their withdrawal from the Yan bandit's "Comrades Association" and "Iron Army Cadre" and other special agent organizations. They turned the bitter water in their stomachs into a roar of anger to kill the enemy! Second-class soldier Liu Guoping recounted that after he was taken away by the 69th Division, there was nothing to eat at home. His mother and wife came to say that they could not survive at home, and they were driven away by the company, who said that they were sending information to the Eighth Route Army, and Liu Guoping was locked in the room and forced to confess. Liu fainted from fright. Speaking of this, his tears rolled down. Quartermaster Liu Shuangcai said: "Once the battalion adjutant asked me to steal vegetables from the villagers. When I said no, he slapped me twice. I swallowed my tears and deserted, but was caught and imprisoned again, and only given a thin soup of three liang of rice a day. This time, the Liberation Army saved my life." Second-class soldier Zhang Ziyi cried and said: "At the time of the organization, the old people said that they could not survive at home. I was conscripted into the army in February. I didn't know how to drill, and the squad leader was going to beat me to death." He shouted angrily: "I want to join the Liberation Army! Eliminate Yan Xishan!" (Ma Ming)

[Jinzhong News] The new liberated soldiers of Jinzhong who joined our army have successively accused Yan's bandits of their crimes and exposed the dark rule in Yan's army, and are determined to eradicate the scourge of Chiang and Yan bandits to avenge their hatred. At the grievance meeting of the third squad of the 201st Brigade, He Chengtong, a liberated soldier from Jinyuan, burst into tears as soon as he spoke. When he narrated that during Yan's bandit "organization," he was forced to say that he was eighteen years old when he was only seventeen, and was conscripted into the army. Because he could not carry a stone weighing more than a hundred pounds during training, he was tied up by the platoon leader and detained for seven days. Because he said he was "hungry" because he was not full, he was identified as a "disguised element" and was brutally beaten. He said angrily: "This suffering was given by Yan Xishan. I will attack Taiyuan, catch him, and cut him piece by piece." Jiao Guiwa, a liberated soldier from Wangjiazhuang, was forced to join the army, and was tied up and pushed into a burial pit, buried up to his waist, and ordered to "be free." Because he was not full all day long, his family brought him six jin of fried noodles, which was stolen by the platoon leader by four jin. He had to ask the sergeant to eat, and he only ate four liang. He said: "This suffering cannot be suffered in vain. Only by resolutely eliminating Yan Xishan can we avenge our hatred." Liberated soldier Liu Xuecheng said: "At home, I suffered the landlords' anger, and when I was a soldier, I suffered the officials' anger. I was forced to become a soldier, and the only half mu of reed land in my family was also occupied by the landlord. When I got to the army, I couldn't get enough to eat all day long. I drilled during the day and pushed the mill at night. In the cold winter and twelfth lunar month, I marched in heavy snow without shoes, and no one cared if my feet were frostbitten. Today I was liberated, and I realized that all this suffering was given to me by the reactionaries. I have made up my mind that only by resolutely eradicating the scourge of Chiang and Yan can the poor people turn over." Han Zigui, a new liberated soldier from the sixth squad, said: "After I was forced to be organized and pulled to Yan's bandit's new recruit brigade, they told me to be a 'little tiger' to harm people (Iron Army organization). The captain thought I didn't report things, called me a 'dead tiger' and slapped me again." Yang Hong had spent money twice when he was organized. After being forced to become a soldier for the third time, he was often in a state of terror in the atmosphere of checking the Eighth Route Army today and checking "disguise" tomorrow, and could not live. Recalling the scene when he was just liberated, he said: "Because I was deceived by the enemy's propaganda for a while, I was a little scared when I was just liberated, but the comrades treated me like brothers, and since then my heart has changed. I want to attack Taiyuan, catch Yan Xishan, and settle accounts with the old dog." (Chen Keng)

Having Heard the Accusations of the People of Jinzhong, the Soldiers are Determined to Avenge and Catch Yan the Thief
[Jinzhong News] After our certain unit of the First Corps of the North China Field Army entered the newly liberated area of Jinzhong, the local people constantly accused us of the suffering they had suffered under Yan the thief's evil government. On August 11, an elderly man named Li Tianban, who was 58 years old, said to the troops: "I would like to say to the Communist Party and the Liberation Army what is in my heart. My family of seven were originally poor peasants. Yan Xishan's 'Integration of Soldiers and Peasants' took away all the land. The old and young in the family had no labor force, and they had to grow ten mu of land for the national soldiers, and produce seventeen shi of grain. They couldn't eat a full meal all year round. When the harvest came this summer, the pseudo-township chief and the 'special commissioner' personally supervised it. They wanted it after every harvest. They couldn't eat a full meal all year round. They couldn't make a living, so they sold the broken furniture in their home and bought seven jin of sesame cakes. The whole family ate four jin in three days, and the remaining three jin were also taken away by the pseudo-township chief. The whole family cried bitterly, watching the old and young starving and unable to move. In order to let the children escape alive, they found a 23-year-old husband for their ten-year-old daughter. Even in this situation, they constantly called us to serve. Because we couldn't eat enough and were hungry, we couldn't walk, and I was beaten to death several times. If it weren't for the life-saving benefactor, the Liberation Army, who came early, nine out of ten families in this place would have starved to death." The comrades were moved to tears after hearing this. After the × company went back, they launched a heated discussion in the squad. Soldier Liu Futian said: "When I joined the army, I didn't want to leave home far away, so I deserted. I feel very sad after listening to the villagers' accusations. If our place hadn't been liberated by the Communist Party earlier, it would be like the people here. I am determined to study hard, improve my skills, kill more enemies, and capture Taiyuan as soon as possible." The comrades in the telephone platoon reviewed and said: "Seeing the suffering of the people in Jinzhong, it was wrong to not save the people's strength in the past. In the future, we will try our best to carry it ourselves, so as not to increase the burden on the people." Ge Xiuhai said: "I feel very sad after listening to the villagers' accusations. When I was at home, my father went to the field to get some firewood, and the landlord saw it and insisted that he had taken his wet firewood, saying that he had committed a crime, and fined him one shi and two dou of wheat, including the expenses of the person in charge. Since then, it has become a bottomless pit, and it is not enough every year, so he became poor. Only after the three investigations and studies did my class consciousness improve, and I realized that I was doing it for myself. But I still miss my home. Recalling that I used to miss my home often was wrong. I must practice high skills, strengthen political training, resolutely attack Taiyuan, capture Yan the old thief alive, and get rid of this old scourge to avenge the people of Jinzhong." (He Jia)

A Good Example of Obeying Discipline: Company Commander Li Weishun
Comrade Li Weishun, the company commander of the Seventh Company of a certain regiment, usually loves his soldiers and is brave in battle. He has shown mastery of principles and good implementation of discipline in this Jinzhong Campaign, and has therefore made meritorious service.

During the Wanghu battle, he checked a dozen prisoners. A prisoner platoon leader was very scared and took out thirteen silver dollars to give him: "Comrade, do you want it? I don't want it!" Not only did he not want it, but he explained: "Don't be afraid, our People's Liberation Army has liberated you and you are one of us. We don't want anything of your own. We will register it for you, and the things will not disappear." The prisoner platoon leader happily pointed to their dozen people and said: "Whoever has anything, take it out and let the chief see it, and it will not disappear after registration." One of them took out another seven silver dollars. After registration, they were all returned to the person. This influenced the communication soldier Wu Zhong. When he caught a prisoner, the prisoner gave him something, but he refused and explained: "We don't want your own things. If you hand over your weapons, you are one of us." Gao Shiyi, the leader of the first machine gun squad, also refused the offer and things from the prisoner. He said to everyone: "None of our comrades should covet the prisoners' things. This is our policy, and no one should violate it. We must strive to be a model company and see who obeys it well. Explaining to the prisoners plays a great role and is also one of the conditions for making meritorious service." In Yuci City, he immediately asked the cooks to weigh two bags of flour seized from the enemy's county government and reported them to the higher authorities as they were. At that time, some comrades said: "Why not report less?" He immediately explained: "We are the party army of the Communist Party, and we must be practical and realistic, and we must not be hypocritical to the superiors and hold two minds with the party." When our army entered Yuci City, many villagers were very scared under the deceptive propaganda of Yan the bandit. He saw a villager trying to run and asked: "Where are you from? What do you have on you?" The villager said: "I am a merchant in the city" while taking out a watch and a roll of bandit currency from his pocket and giving it to him. Li Weishun said kindly: "Villagers, don't be afraid. We are the People's Liberation Army, and we are fighting for the people. You don't know yet, we don't want anything from the people. Don't run, go back quickly, it's okay, our troops don't beat or scold, you will know in a few days." In Chewan Liujialei Village, when the troops had their meal, there was the villagers' garlic field next to it. Some comrades pulled the villagers' garlic to eat because they had no vegetables. When he saw it, he explained to everyone: "We have violated the discipline of the masses. This is the people's thing. Of course, we have difficulties, but this is temporary. What kind of impact will this have on the newly liberated villagers?" Everyone listened and stopped eating.

　　把苦水变成了杀敌的怒吼！
  　晋中解放战士四一二名
    自动报名参加解放军
    【晋中电】晋中前线某部首批解放之阎军四一二名报名参加解放军。他们是去冬今春被阎匪强编或抓去的农民，先后于孝义贾家庄、文水南北齐等历次战斗中解放过来的。他们一见到解放区民主自由、有吃有穿的好生活，就回忆起在阎占区及阎匪军中的痛苦情形来。加上对我军宽大政策的亲身体验，使他们深受感动，很快觉醒过来。在二四六人的一个队上，就有五十八人声明脱离阎匪“同志会”“铁军基干”等特务组织。他们把肚里的苦水变成了杀敌的怒吼！二等兵刘国平诉说他被六十九师抓走后家里没吃的，母亲老婆找来说了一句家里不能活，就被连里赶走，说她们是给八路军送情报，把刘国平关在房内，硬叫他自白。刘被吓的昏过去。说到这里，他的眼泪滚滚而下。勤务兵刘双财说：“有一次营部副官叫我去偷老乡的菜，我说不去，一连打了我两个耳光，我把泪咽在肚里，开了小差，又被抓回来坐了监，一天只给三两米的稀汤。这回才叫解放军救下我的命。”二等兵张子义哭着说：“编组时，老人就说家里没法活了。二月里抓我当了兵，我不会操法，班长就要往死里打我。”他愤怒的高呼：“我要参加解放军！消灭阎锡山！”（马明）
    【晋中讯】参加我军之晋中新解放战士，纷纷控诉阎匪罪行与揭露阎匪军中的黑暗统治，并下定决心拔除蒋阎匪祸根报仇雪恨。在二○一大队三小队的诉苦会上，晋源解放战士贺成统刚一发言，即不由的痛哭起来。当他叙述到阎匪“编组”时，把他逼打着硬将十七岁说成十八岁抓了兵，因练兵背不动百多斤的大石头，被排长捆起押了七天，因吃不饱饭说了句“肚饿”而被指为“伪装分子”，惨遭毒打，他愤怒的说：“这苦都是阎锡山给的，打进太原捉住他，非一刀刀剐了他不行。”王家庄解放战士焦桂娃被迫当兵后，又被捆着推到埋人坑里埋着半截身子，勒令“自由”，因整天吃不饱，家里给捎来六斤炒面，就被排长偷去了四斤，到班上还得请上等兵吃，轮到自己仅吃了四两。他说：“这苦不能白受，只有坚决把阎锡山消灭才算报了仇。”解放战士刘学成说：“在家受老财的气，当兵受做官的气，我被迫当了兵，家里仅有的半亩苇地也被地主霸占去。到部队上是成天吃不饱，白天下操，夜晚推磨，十冬腊月下大雪行军没鞋，脚冻烂了也没人理。今天我得到了解放，才懂得这些苦都是反动派给我的。我已下定决心，只有坚决拔掉蒋阎祸根，穷人才能翻身。”六小队新解放战士韩自贵说：“我被迫编组拉到阎匪新兵大队后，叫我当‘小老虎’害人（铁军组织），队长嫌我不报告事情，把我叫去骂我是‘死老虎’，又打了我一顿耳光。”杨洪被编组时曾花了两次钱，到第三次被迫当兵后，却经常在今天查八路，明天查“伪装”的恐怖空气中闹得提心吊胆，没法生活。他回忆到刚解放过来的情景时说：“因为我一时受了敌人的欺骗宣传，所以刚解放过来时心里有些害怕，可是同志们待我却象弟兄一样，从此我的心就变了。要打进太原捉住阎锡山，非和老狗日算帐不行。”（陈铿）
    　　　　听了晋中人民的控诉　战士决心报仇捉阎贼
    【晋中讯】我们华北野战第一兵团某部，进入晋中新解放区后，驻地人民不断向我们控诉阎贼恶政下所受的痛苦。八月十一日，又有一位五十八岁的老年人李天半向部队说：“我愿向共产党、解放军道说道说我的心里话。我家七口人，原是贫农，阎锡山‘兵农合一’把地都给合走了，家里老的老小的小没有劳力，还得给国民兵代种十亩地，出十七石粮，养种一年吃不上一顿饱饭。今夏打场时，伪乡长和‘特派员’亲身监督，打一场要一场，养种一年吃不上一顿饱饭。无法生活，就把家里破烂家具卖了，买回七斤油饼，全家三天吃了四斤，剩下三斤也被伪乡长拿走了。全家痛哭一场，眼看老少饿的走不动了。为叫孩子们逃个活命，把十岁的女儿找了个二十三岁的丈夫。就这光景还不断的叫俺支差。因吃不上饭，饿的心慌，走不动，把我几次打的死去活来。要不是救命恩人解放军早来了，这地方十家就得饿死九家。”同志们听了，感动的滴下泪来。×连回去后，在班里展开热烈的讨论。战士刘富田说：“我参军时不愿离家远了，曾开过小差。听了老乡诉苦，我心里很难过。我们那里要不是共产党早解放了，得象这里人民一样。我下定决心，保证好好学习，提高技术，多杀些敌人，早打下太原。”电话排的同志们检讨说：“看到晋中人民这样痛苦，过去行军不节省民力是错误的。今后尽量自己扛，做到不加重人民负担。”葛修海说：“听了老乡诉苦，很难受，在家时我父亲去地里弄了点烧柴，被地主看见，硬说是弄了他的湿柴，说是犯了法，连罚带办事人花费了一石二斗麦子。从此成了无底窟窿，一年还不够一年，便弄穷了。经三查学习才提高了我的阶级觉悟，才晓得是为自己干。可是还想家，回想我过去常想家是不对的，我一定要练高技术，加强政治锻炼，坚决打进太原去，活捉阎老贼，刨掉这老祸根，为晋中人民复仇。”（何家）
    　　　　遵守纪律的好榜样　李维顺连长
    某团七连连长李维顺同志，平时爱兵，打仗勇敢，这次晋中战役中更表现了掌握原则，执行纪律好，因此立了功。
    在王胡战斗时，他检查十几个俘虏，一个俘虏排长很害怕，拿出十三块白洋来给他：“同志你要吧，我不要了！”他不但不要，而且解释说：“你们不要害怕，咱们人民解放军解放了你们就是一家人，你自己的东西我们谁都不要，给你登记起来，东西没不了。”俘虏排长高兴的指着他们十几个人说：“谁有什么，拿出来叫首长看看，登记起来没不了。”里边有一个又拿出了七块白洋，登记后全还给了本人。这样影响了通信员武忠，他捉住俘虏，俘虏给他表他拒绝后解释说：“我们不要你自己的东西，交了武器就是一家人了。”一机枪班长高十一，俘虏给他表和东西，也同样拒绝了。他给大家说：“我们同志谁也不要眼热俘虏的东西，这是咱们的政策，谁都不要违犯，咱们要争取当模范连，看谁遵守的好。给俘虏作解释起的作用大，也同样是立功条件之一。”在榆次城，从敌人县政府缴下两袋面，他马上叫炊事员秤了，如数报了上级，当时有的同志说：“不如少报点。”他马上解释说：“咱们是共产党的党军，要实事求是，不能对上级虚伪，和党抱两条心。”我军进了榆次城，不少老乡在阎匪欺骗宣传下很害怕。他看见了一个老乡想跑，就问：“你是哪里的，身上有什么东西。”那个老乡一边说：“我是城里做买卖的。”一边从口袋里掏出一只表和一卷匪币给他，李维顺很和善的说：“老乡，你可不要害怕，咱们是人民解放军，是为老百姓打仗的，你今天还不知道，我们一点东西也不要老百姓的，你不要跑了，快回去吧，没事，咱的部队又不打骂，你等几天就知道了。”在车湾刘家垒村时，部队开了饭，旁边就是老乡的蒜地，有的同志因没菜，拔老乡的蒜吃，他看见就给大家解释：“咱们这是犯了群众纪律，这是老百姓的东西，咱们困难是当然的，但这是暂时的，如这样给新解放区老百姓个什么影响呢？”大家听了就都不吃了。
