The "Combat Model" red flag of a certain unit of the Jinzhong Military Region was planted in the first squad of "Warrior's Dear Brothers" Tian Guifu's platoon at the August 15th celebration meeting for meritorious service. Under the leadership of platoon leader Tian Guifu and former first squad leaders Duan Hailong, Fan Guihai, and current squad leader Gao Shidang, this squad has cultivated and promoted two deputy platoon leaders, two squad leaders, and two deputy squad leaders. It has produced major meritorious individuals like Duan Hailong, as well as three meritorious individuals and six minor meritorious individuals (including four who received additional awards).

Combat Model

From January to July, in seven months, they carried out fourteen major missions, sacrificing only one person. They captured seventy-five enemies, seized fifty-one rifles, six light machine guns, one heavy machine gun, and four light cannons. Why were they able to achieve great victories at such a small cost? Because they were brave, decisive, good at using combat teams, and organizing firepower.

They often used combat teams (two) to cooperate with each other and achieve victory in battle. During the battle of Caogou, the combat team led by Gao Shidang, in a critical situation, put forward the slogan "We must stick together until death." First, one team provided cover while the other team climbed onto the house to control the high ground. Unexpectedly, two enemies had already climbed onto the house. They immediately threw grenades that had already been pulled, driving the enemies down, controlling the rooftop, and annihilating a platoon of enemies without any casualties. In the battle of Nanliang in Shouyang, although the enemy was prepared, because of their swift actions, they embraced the enemy sentries, disarmed them, and rushed into the courtyard before the enemies could come out, quickly resolving the battle. In the battle of Shangshe North and South, they successively repelled four counterattacks by the enemy, and destroyed the enemy's regimental command post of more than two hundred men. Before the assault on Beizhao, they covered the leaders while they reconnoitered the terrain. An enemy battalion came out, only one hundred meters away from them. When retreating, they used one team to cover while the other team retreated, completing the mission without any casualties. During the assault on Beizhao, before resolving the battle, the squad leader carried a box of explosives to breach the outer moat. The firepower of the two teams was organized to block the enemy's gun holes. The squad leader pulled the fuse and rushed forward. The enemy threw out a grenade, but he quickly leaned against the bunker, rendering the enemy's grenade ineffective. They picked up two grenades thrown out by the enemy and threw them back into the bunker through the gun holes, inflicting casualties on two of the four enemies, and they occupied the bunker.

Unity and Consolidation

In ordinary times, the first squad is also a model squad of unity and consolidation. Comrades in the squad help each other and learn from each other. Except for two comrades who have not yet received awards, all the others have received major, meritorious, and minor meritorious awards. Since August of last year, only one person has been sent to the hospital due to illness, three had temporary illnesses, and no one deserted. Why is that? First of all, the squad leader's leadership method is good. They often use praise for good deeds to inspire everyone's enthusiasm. For comrades with ideological problems, they use a democratic approach to discuss them. Li Qingchang and Zheng Shuanglin are the bravest in combat and also work very hard in ordinary times. Li had sores on his body, but did not fall behind during marches, and the squad leader brought it up for praise at the squad meeting, introducing them to inspire everyone. Qiao Shilan, right-leaning and afraid of death, was not sick when eating white flour in the afternoon in Hedong, but when he heard about sweeping utility poles in the afternoon, he said he was sick. After everyone's discussion, he said: "I am afraid of carrying out tasks, I am not sick, I will not pretend to be sick in the future. I am sorry for everyone, I promise to learn from Wang Hantang and Zheng Shuanglin, and I will strive for meritorious service in the future." Li Haiyan was not active in public service, especially in this campaign, when asked to dig fortifications he refused. After criticisms were made on the position, he became active. All the soldiers in the squad strive for progress and talk to each other to help others progress. Yang Shengmao, the leader of their study group, often automatically went to the company headquarters to find "Victory News" (military newspaper) and "Comrade-in-Arms" to introduce good experiences, models of abiding by discipline and standing firm, etc. When the liberated soldier Li Jincheng first came, he did nothing, but after the squad leader Fan Guihai washed his scabies and applied medicine to cure it, he felt that everyone was very good to him and became active in his work. Qiao Shilan often wanted to ask for leave to go home, so everyone in the squad told the story of "Xia Yu passing by his house without entering" and said to Qiao: "You are from the liberated area, what are you going back for?" Gradually, Qiao's homesickness was overcome. Wang Hantang (a liberated soldier) had his family settled, and often said strange things. During the party rectification, people called him a landlord, and he was dissatisfied and raised the issue to the squad: "It's enough if I don't have landlord thinking, don't always call me a landlord." After the squad meeting explained, "As long as you don't have it in your actions and thoughts, don't be afraid of that." Later, his mood was high and his position was firm. When Gao Jifu wanted to lure him into deserting, he thought it was wrong and told the squad leader, and launched an ideological struggle against Gao at the squad meeting, letting Gao set out a plan for reform.

Everyone in the squad is united like brothers, not distinguishing between you and me. When Zheng Shuanglin was sick, the squad leader Fan Guihai bought him two catties of pears, and the soldiers pooled their money (five thousand yuan) to buy four ounces of honey. Wang Yuanlin got up in the dark to get a urinal and boil water. When Wang Hantang was sick, the comrades in the squad were afraid that the food prepared by the kitchen would not suit his taste, so they brought things to the squad, and made whatever Wang wanted to eat. Wang Hantang and Zheng Shuanglin said: "I never want to leave the first squad." Therefore, they also won the glorious title of "Model Squad for Consolidating Troops." (Zhang Kerang)

### 红旗插在第一班

　　红旗插在第一班
    晋中军区某部以“战斗模范”的红旗在八月十五日庆功大会上插在了大功功臣“战士亲弟兄”田贵福排的第一班。这班在排长田贵福和原一班班长段海龙、范贵海、现班长高世堂同志领导下，培养和提拔了副排长两个、班长两个，副班长两个，涌现了大功功臣段海龙、及三个立功功臣，六个小功功臣（内有四个功上加功）。
  　战斗模范
    一月至七月七个月中，他们执行过十四次主要任务，我仅牺牲一人。俘虏敌人七十五名，缴步枪五十一支，轻机枪六挺，重机枪一挺，轻炮四门。他们为什么能以极小的代价换取大的胜利呢？因为他们英勇果敢，善于使用战斗小组和组织火力。
    他们经常在战斗中用战斗小组（两个）互相配合取得胜利。打草沟时，高世堂带着的战斗小组，在危急的情况下提出了“咱们要死死在一起”的口号。先以一个小组掩护，一个小组爬上房去控制制高点。不料已有两个敌人爬上房去了。他们即将早已拉出火线的手榴弹打到房上去，把敌人压下去，控制了房顶，歼灭了一个排的敌人，毫无伤亡。寿阳南梁战斗，虽然敌人早有准备，但由于他们动作轻快，把敌人的哨兵抱住，下了武器，冲到院子里敌人还没出来，很快又解决了战斗。南北上社战斗，他们一连打垮了敌人的四次反冲锋。打垮了敌二百多人的团指挥所。北赵攻坚战前，他们掩护首长看地形，敌人一个营的兵力出来，离他们只一百米达了，往回退时，他们以一个组掩护，一个组退，结果毫无伤亡的完成了任务。北赵攻坚，解决战斗前，班长搬了一箱子炸药去爆破外壕，两个组的火器组织起来封锁了敌人的枪眼，班长拉了炸药，先冲上去，敌人打出了炸弹，他很快靠在地堡跟前，使敌人打出来的炸弹无效。他们又拾起敌人打出来的两个炸弹从地堡的枪眼里给敌人打进去，四个敌人伤亡各二，他们进占了地堡。
  　团结巩固
    在平时，一班又是团结巩固的模范班。班里同志们互相帮助，互相学习。全班除两个同志没立过功外，其余都立了大功、功、小功。去年八月以来只病送院一人，临时发生病的三人，没有逃亡。他们为什么会这样呢？首先是班长领导方法好，他们常以表扬好的来启发大家的积极性，对思想有毛病的同志，以民主方式大家评。李庆昌、郑双林战斗上最勇敢，平时又很吃苦。李身上有疮，行军不掉队，班长就在班务会上提出表扬。介绍他俩，启发大家。乔石兰，右倾怕死，在河东下午吃白面时还没病，下午听说扫电杆，他就说是病了，经过大家评论后，他说：“我是怕执行任务，没有病，以后我不装病了。对不起大家，保证向王汉堂、郑双林学习，我要争取今后立功。”李海彦公差勤务不积极，特别在这次战役中，叫挖工事不挖，大家在阵地上即开展批评以后就积极了。全班战士都争着进步，又互相谈话帮助别人进步。他们的学习小组长杨生茂同志常自动到连部找“胜利报”（部队报纸）和“战友”给大家介绍好的经验，遵守纪律站稳立场的模范等。解放战士李金成刚来时，什么也不干，但经班长范贵海给他洗疥，抹药，把疥治好后，他感到大家对他很好，工作积极了。乔石兰常想请假回家，大家在班里就讲开了“夏禹治水路过家门不进家”的故事，并说乔：“你是解放区的，回去干甚哩。”逐渐克服了乔的想家思想。王汉堂（解放战士）家里被清算了，常说怪话，在整党中人们都叫他地主，他不满意向班里提出意见：“我没有地主思想就行了，老叫我地主。”经班务会解释“只要自己在行动中，思想中没有了，不要怕那样。”后来情绪高了，立场坚定了，郜计福想勾引他开小差时，他想不对，告诉班长，在班务会上向郜开展了思想斗争，让郜订出改过计划来。
    大家在班里团结的象亲兄弟，不分你我，郑双林病了时，班长范贵海给买了二斤梨，战士们把自己身上的钱集中起来（五千元）买了四两蜂蜜，王元林黑夜起来给拿尿盆、烧水。王汉堂在病时，班里的同志怕伙房做下的饭不合口味，把东西领到班里，王想吃什么就给做什么。王汉堂、郑双林说：“我永不想离开一班了。”因此他们又得到了“巩固部队模范班”的光荣称号。（张克让）
