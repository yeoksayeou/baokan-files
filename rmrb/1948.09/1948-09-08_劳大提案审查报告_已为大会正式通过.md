Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th: The Labor Congress listened to Chen Yu's report on the review of proposals on the morning of October 22nd. In total, the Congress received 387 proposals, of which 117 were related to labor protection and employee welfare, 49 were related to wages, working hours, holidays, technical rewards, and factory management, and over 200 were related to trade union organization, employee education, labor movement work in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, proposals from overseas Chinese, and the political tasks of various constructions and employee movements of the liberated areas to the government. Each proposal was submitted with review opinions and approved by the assembly. Proposals regarding the convening of a new Political Consultative Conference, opposing American imperialism's support for the revival of Japanese fascist forces, as well as those concerning employee old age, disability, and illness, equal pay for equal work for male and female workers, and welcoming technicians from the Kuomintang areas to the liberated areas, were deemed to be included in the reports by Comrades Gao Gang and Chen Yun and the "Resolution on the Current Tasks of Chinese Workers" passed by the Congress and therefore, no separate resolutions were made. The proposal regarding employee cooperatives included the establishment of employee cooperatives to solve the difficulty of supplying employees with daily necessities, that all enterprises and factories should establish cooperatives, attract employees to invest, and that enterprises, factories, and the government should assist cooperatives in establishing democratic centralism organizational and working systems; state trading agencies should help employee cooperatives purchase goods; and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions should provide as much help and guidance as possible to the establishment and improvement of cooperatives. The review committee believes that these proposals are very important, and all trade unions should consult with factories to establish, improve, or expand employee cooperatives and request the government to provide more possible assistance, and the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions should provide as much help and guidance as possible to the establishment and improvement of employee cooperatives. Other proposals, such as those suggesting that the government investigate and develop mining industry, various proposals related to employee cooperatives, and the formulation of commendation methods for employees in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to assist in the liberation struggle, were all decided to be submitted to the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the governments of the liberated areas for specific research and handling.
