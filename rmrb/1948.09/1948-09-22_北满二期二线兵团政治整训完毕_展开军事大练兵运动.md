Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th. After undergoing political rectification and preliminary technical training, the second-line corps of the second phase in various military regions of Northern Manchuria have now launched a large-scale military training movement. The units of the Hejiang Military Region particularly emphasized the integration of training with actual combat experience. In response to several unrealistic shortcomings identified after the first-phase second-line corps joined the main force in combat, it was decided that more aiming at head targets and moving targets should be incorporated in shooting practice this time; when throwing grenades, the action of uncovering and pulling the pin must be included. Many soldiers often run first and then hold their breath to practice aiming, so that they are more confident when shooting on the battlefield. Some soldiers practice throwing grenades targeting enemy bunker loopholes, conducting live throwing exercises to overcome the formalism of simply emphasizing "throwing far." Significant progress has been made in various techniques in each unit. A certain regiment has produced a sharpshooter who hit 95 rings with ten shots. After the technical training in Nenjiang units came to an end, they have now switched to tactical education. In the study, a certain regiment pays attention to linking actions such as blasting, crossing trenches, throwing grenades, charging, and street fighting, and conducts actual exercises to enable commanders and fighters to clearly understand tactical thinking. In addition to actively training during the day, some companies of a regiment in the Songjiang Military Region have also made lantern targets to practice aiming and shooting at night, with good results. In grenade throwing practice, some soldiers initially only threw 15 meters, but after a few days, it doubled to 35 meters. The enthusiasm of the soldiers for training is very high. Some soldiers are reluctant to rest and interrupt their training even when they have minor illnesses. They say, "At the front, we don't leave the line of fire even with minor injuries. Why would we rest when we have a slight illness while training in the rear?" The training work in other military regions such as Jilin, Liaobei, and Heilongjiang is also progressing actively and smoothly. After the end of military training, the Heilongjiang Military Region is conducting widespread military education tests to check training results and summarize experience. The test methods are divided into live ammunition shooting, bayonet fighting, grenade throwing, blasting, tactical exercises, and other items, and formalism and simple championshipism are avoided in the test.

　　北满二期二线兵团政治整训完毕
  　展开军事大练兵运动
    【新华社东北十九日电】北满各军区第二期第二线兵团经过政治整训及初步技术教练后，现已展开军事大练兵运动。合江军区各部特别强调与实际战斗经验结合，针对第一期二线兵团加入主力作战后所检讨出的若干不切实际的缺点，决定在这次练习射击时要多瞄人头靶、活靶；投弹时须将揭盖拉练的动作列入。许多战士常先跑步，再压住气练习瞄准，以便到战场上射击时更有把握。有的战士以敌地堡枪眼为目标练习投弹，进行实地投掷，克服单纯的讲究“投弹远”的形式主义，现各部对各项技术均获显著进步，某团并出现十枪射中九十五环的神枪手。嫩江各部于技术教练告一段落后，现已转入战术教育。某团学习中注意联系爆破、过壕、投弹、冲锋、巷战等动作，并进行实际演习，使指战员们都能明显的体会战术思想。松江军区某团若干连队除日间积极练兵外，并做了灯笼靶，在夜间练习瞄准射击，效果颇好。练习投弹中，开始有些战士仅投十五米，几天后即倍增至三十五米。战士练兵情绪十分高涨，某些战士虽生小病也不愿休息中断，他们说：“在前方轻伤都不下火线，在后方练兵有点小病还休息吗？”他如吉林、辽北、黑龙江各军区练兵工作，亦均在积极顺利进行中。黑龙江军区于军事教练结束后，为检查练兵成绩与总结经验，正普遍举行军事教育测验，测验办法共分实弹射击、刺杀、投弹、爆破、战术演习等项目，在测验中均力免形式主义与单纯的锦标主义。
