Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th -- To Convey the Joy of the Rear to the Frontline Victory: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui慰問团 Arrives at the Front.
　　The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui All Circles慰問团 arrived at the front lines a few days ago. That afternoon, they went to the headquarters to congratulate Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai and Deputy Commanders Zhang Zongxun and Zhao Shoushan on the great victory of annihilating the 36th Division and express their condolences. Deputy Commander Peng also expressed his heartfelt thanks for the help and support of the party, government, military, civilians, students, and working cadres and people in the new areas in the rear; he was very concerned about the production and disaster relief situation in the rear. Labor hero Yang Buhao happily said: "The disaster caused by the Hu bandits has passed after everyone's hard work in production. After the wheat harvest, we are also eating melons, vegetables and red bean pods. This year's autumn rain is strong, and after the autumn harvest, the disaster will completely pass, and we can look forward to a good life of abundance and sufficient food and clothing year after year." The representatives had a lively conversation with the leaders for more than an hour before leaving. The Northwest People's Liberation Army's headquarters and political organs held a grand welcoming party to welcome the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui All Circles慰問团. At the meeting, the representatives of the慰問团 recited the慰問 speech, and Wang Weizhou, the head of the慰問团, on behalf of the seven million people in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Liberated Area, presented a red banner decorated with a lighthouse pattern to Deputy Commander Peng Dehuai of the Field Army. The representatives also spoke one after another, conveying the joy and encouragement of the rear to the news of the frontline victory, and the warm support and earnest condolences of the party, government, military, civilians, students from all walks of life in the rear to the field army. Yang Mingxuan, vice chairman of the慰問团, specifically stated in his speech that the government is currently focusing on two things: mobilizing soldiers who have taken leave and not returned and deserters to return to the team, and giving preferential treatment to military families, encouraging frontline commanders and fighters to fight with peace of mind. Zhang Shulin, chairman of the Yan'an City Chamber of Commerce, described that the industry and commerce of Yan'an City have recovered to the pre-war situation, and the number of industrial and commercial operators in the city has reached 867. The industrial and commercial operators in the rear will work hard to prosper the market, develop the economy, and support the front lines. Han Qixiang, a folk artist representative from Yan'an Division, also played "Three Great Victories" and other songs at the meeting to add to the fun. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely enthusiastic. The next day, the慰問团 set off to visit various troops to express their condolences.
