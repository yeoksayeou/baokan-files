Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 9th: The Northeast Workers' Representative Conference opened on August 1st, simultaneously with the National Labor Conference, and closed on August 22nd, also simultaneously with the Labor Conference. The Northeast delegates attending the National Labor Conference were also the delegates attending the Northeast Workers' Representative Conference; therefore, the opening and closing ceremonies were combined with the Labor Conference. After the opening ceremony, the delegates participated in the agenda of the Labor Conference. After the Labor Conference concluded its agenda on national issues on the 13th of last month, the Northeast Workers' Representative Conference formally discussed issues related to the Northeast workers' movement. Non-Northeast delegates attending the Labor Conference also participated in the sessions.

From the 14th onwards, the conference successively listened to and discussed reports by Guo Linjun on the "Regulations on Production Emulation Campaign in Northeast Public Enterprises," Chen Yu on the draft "Provisional Wartime Labor Insurance Regulations for Northeast Public Enterprises," Zhang Weizhen on the outline of the "Wartime Labor Regulations of Harbin," and Tang Yunchao on the "Charter of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions." The conference approved the aforementioned reports in principle on the 21st. The outline of the Wartime Labor Regulations of Harbin was formulated based on the principles of developing production, prospering the economy, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital within the New Democratic economic policy. Originally named the Labor Law Outline, it was proposed by the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in February this year and passed at the Harbin Workers' Representative Conference on May 1st. It has now been revised according to the spirit of Comrade Chen Yun's report on the current tasks of the workers' movement. Because it is wartime and of a trial nature, it has been renamed the Labor Regulations Outline. During the discussion, the Hegang delegation proposed that these regulations be used as the wartime labor regulations for the Northeast Liberated Area, and the conference decided to submit them to the Executive Committee of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and the Northeast Administrative Committee for discussion and decision. The Charter of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions was formulated according to the spirit of the Charter of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and in accordance with the local conditions in the Northeast.

On the 20th, the conference elected the Executive Committee of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions. A total of 71 executive committee members were elected, including 47 official members and 24 alternate members.
