[Jizhong Electric] Dongsigong Village in the Eighth District of Gaocheng County, a flood-affected village, has broken away from the simple reliance on relief and is organizing the masses for production and self-salvation through various means. The village has a total of 454 households with 2,253 people. It has 6,451.7 mu of land, of which 5,377.2 mu were flooded, including 4,252.1 mu buried in sand. There are still 275 mu of land underwater. Additionally, 142 wells were damaged and 34 houses collapsed. After the floodwaters receded, when the village began to organize production for disaster relief, the district cadres held an attitude of bestowing favors and did not send anyone to the village to investigate and understand the situation. They only sent a message to the village, asking the village to register how much buckwheat would be planted, so that the cooperative could lend them seeds. As a result, 215 households were counting on borrowing seeds. However, the seeds were never lent out, and the district did not send anyone to explain, which resulted in dissatisfaction among the masses, and buckwheat was not planted. On August 16th, district cadres went to the village to organize the masses for production and self-salvation. They learned that the cadres had a strong mentality of simply relying on disaster relief. The district cadres first convened a joint meeting of the branch committee and group leaders to educate them, explaining that Party members and cadres leading the masses to overcome the famine through production was "disaster relief" work, and they should find ways to mobilize the masses for production and self-salvation. They also discussed how the branch committee and group leaders should divide their work, investigate and register disaster-stricken households, how to organize carts for transportation, and mobilize weaving households to organize and carry out textile production. After the meeting, they held a general meeting of all village cadres and elected a production and disaster relief committee. They also separately convened meetings of weaving households and cart-owning households to implement the education of production for self-salvation, putting forward slogans such as "Relieving you for one day won't solve the hunger of a thousand days" and "If you want to eat, find work to do." They also organized through core members. Based on the village's production foundation, the district cadres found various avenues for the masses to produce. The village originally had 227 livestock, but after the flood, 90 were sold due to lack of work and fodder. If transportation is not organized, the number of livestock will continue to decrease. The cooperative has established a coal yard on the north bank of the Pangtuo River to supply transportation to disaster-stricken villages in Hebei. Currently, Dongsigong Village has 32 voluntarily formed cart teams with 56 livestock, preparing to engage in transportation and sales. The village has 110 looms, of which 61 are currently in operation. The rest are not operating due to lack of capital and low profits from weaving (each bolt of cloth can only earn 1,000 to 3,000 yuan). However, the masses in the village have high confidence in textile production as a means of fighting disaster, with the saying: "Don't be afraid of a lean year, just be afraid that textile production won't make money." They are asking the government to find ways to solve the sales problem. The county cooperative and district cadres are actively trying to solve this problem. In addition, the district cadres are also planning to introduce some surplus young and middle-aged laborers to work at the station and coal yard, in order to overcome the famine through various means.

　　打破依赖赈济思想多方组织生产自救
    【冀中电】藁城八区水灾村东四公，打破单纯依赖赈济思想，从多方设法组织群众生产自救。该村共四百五十四户，二千二百五十三人。有地六千四百五十一亩七分，五千三百七十七亩二分被水淹，其中四千二百五十二亩一分淤了沙。现在还有二百七十五亩地有水。还淤坏水井一百四十二眼，塌房三十四间。水撤以后，开始组织该村生产救灾时，因为区干部存在着恩赐观点，又没派人到该村调查了解，只给村里捎了个信，叫村里登记种多少荞麦，好说给推进社贷给种子。结果二百一十五户专指望着贷种。但后来种子也没贷下来，区里也没来人解释，结果遭到群众不满，荞麦也没有种上。八月十六日，区干部到该村组织群众生产自救，了解到干部单纯依赖赈灾的劲头很大，区干部首先召开了支委、小组长联席会，进行教育，说明党员，干部领导群众生产渡荒是“救灾”工作，应想法发动群众生产自救。并讨论了支委和小组长如何分工，调查登记灾户，如何组织大车搞运输，发动织布户组织起来开展纺织等问题。会后，又开了全体村干会选举了生产救灾委员会。并又分头召集织布户、大车户开会，贯彻了生产自救的教育，提出“救你一日饱、解不了千日饥”、“要吃饭找活干”等口号。并通过骨干进行组织。区干部根据该村生产基础，从多方为群众找出生产门路。该村原有牲口二百二十七个，发生水灾后，因没活干和缺少草料，已卖出九十个，如不搞运输，牲口还会减少。推进社便在滂沱河北岸设立了一个煤炭厂，供给河北灾村运输。现在东四公村已自由结伙三十二辆大车，五十六头牲口，准备跑运销。该村有织布机一百一十张，现在正动着的六十一张，其余的因为本钱少，织布利小（每匹布只能赚一千元到三千元）没有活动着。但该村群众对纺织抗灾信心很高，流传着：“不怕过歉年，就怕纺织不赚钱。”要求政府设法解决销路问题。现该县推进社和区干部，正积极设法解决这个问题。另外区干部并计划介绍一些剩余的青壮年劳动力，到车站、煤厂作工，从多方面设法渡荒。
