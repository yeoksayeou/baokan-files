　　Yuci Democratic Government Correctly Implements Policies

  　Three Hundred Stores Resume Business

    [Jinzhong News] After the liberation of Yuci, the democratic government correctly implemented the policy of protecting private industry and commerce. With the assistance of the original Chamber of Commerce, it held separate forums for businessmen to publicize policies and stabilize the mood of businessmen and residents. Three hundred and three businesses have already opened their doors. The government also provided loans of 5 million yuan to support them. The state-owned trading company, in order to regulate the market and supply the daily necessities of the citizens, has sold 400 shi of wheat, 5,600 jin of sea salt, and 1,000 jin of sesame oil to the market. Prices immediately fell. Sea salt fell from 900 yuan per jin to 750 yuan, and sesame oil fell from 6,400 yuan per jin to 3,200 yuan. Our army seized nearly 10 million jin of coal stockpiled by the Yan bandits, which was sold to the citizens at a low price by the trading company. The democratic government also protects the industry and commerce of general Yan puppet personnel. The Social Restaurant opened by the pseudo-Yuci County Mayor, the Public Security Bureau Chief, and the Military Police Captain, although they themselves have fled with the Yan army and taken most of the capital with them, the democratic government still protects the personnel and property they left behind, allowing them to operate freely. Only the physical reserve society, the Xi Lian Society, the He Lian Society, and the Xinmin Factory, which were publicly operated by the Yan puppet organs, were registered and accepted by the government according to law.

　　榆次民主政府正确执行政策
  　三百家商店恢复营业
    【晋中讯】榆次解放后，民主政府正确执行保护私人工商业的政策，在原商会协助下，分头召开商人座谈会，宣传政策，安定商民情绪，市面已有三百零三家商号开门营业。政府并贷款五百万元予以扶植。公营贸易公司为调剂市面物资，供给市民日用必需品，已向市场抛售四百石小麦，五千六百斤海盐，一千斤麻油，物价立时下落，海盐由九百元一斤，跌至七百五十元，麻油由六千四百元一斤，跌至三千二百元。我军缴获阎匪集存的近千万斤煤炭，由贸易公司经手廉价售给市民。民主政府对于一般阎伪人员的工商业，同样予以保护，伪榆次县长、公安局长、宪兵队长等所开之社会饭店，虽其本人已随阎军逃走，资本大部带去，民主政府仍保护他们留下的人员财产，使之自由营业。仅阎伪机关公营的实物准备社、系联社、合联社、新民工厂等，由政府依法登记接受。（冰如、春旬）
