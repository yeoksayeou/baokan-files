Xinhua News Agency, East China, 17th: The southeastern coastal counties of Shandong (belonging to the Binhai Partition of the Lu Zhongnan District) are generally reporting a rich harvest. Except for a few areas that suffered from hail and drought disasters resulting in reduced yields, sorghum and millet generally have yields of 80% to 90% or more. In Ju County, out of fourteen districts, only two districts were reduced to 70% due to drought, another two districts yielded 100%, and the rest averaged around 80%. The total of over 400,000 mu of sorghum in the county increased by an average of one-third compared to last year. Rizhao, Zhuting (i.e., Ganyu), Donghai, and other counties, except for coastal areas and a few villages, generally yielded 80% or more in most areas. Zhennan, Chengguan, Zhumeng, Wushan, and other districts in Zhuting achieved a 100% bumper harvest. Due to the development of the increased production movement in the southern districts of Ju (County), calling for more hoeing and fertilization, the yields were particularly high. For example, in Sangzhuang District, Xu Xianrong's 1.2 mu (large mu) of millet in Heilongpo Village yielded 450 jin. He estimated, based on medium-sized millet ears, that each ear had 7,000 grains. Compared to the usual years of "60 for wheat, 3,000 for millet," this year it has more than doubled. Linshu (New County, originally eastern Linyi), except for thirty-some villages in Cangshan and Yushan districts that suffered from hail, generally produced two-fifths more than last year. Wan County also eliminated 50,000 mu of wasteland this year, which can increase grain by 500 jin.

　　山东东南沿海各县
  　今秋普告丰收
    【新华社华东十七日电】山东东南沿海各县（属于鲁中南区的滨海分区）普告丰收。除个别地区因遭受雹灾旱灾而减收外，高粱、谷子一般均有八、九成以上成收。莒县十四个区中，仅两区因天旱减至七成，另两区收十成，其余平均都在八成左右。全县四十余万亩高粱，较去年平均增产三分之一。日照、竹庭（即赣榆）、东海等县除沿海及少数村庄外，大部地区均收八成以上。竹庭之镇南、城关、竹孟、吴山等区均为十成丰收。莒（县）南各区由于展开增产运动，号召多锄多施肥，产量尤高，如桑庄区，黑龙坡村徐先荣的一亩二分（大亩）谷子，收四百五十斤。他以中等谷穗计算，每穗有七千粒，按平常年景“麦收六十、谷三千”，则今年多了一倍多。临沭（新县、原临沂东部）除仓山、玉山两区三十余村遭雹灾外，普遍较去年多产五分之二。万县今年并消灭了五万亩荒地，可增加粮食五百斤。
