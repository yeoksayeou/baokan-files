　　Restoring Organization, Establishing Systems
　　Laishui Cadre Study Achieves Results
    [Beiyue Telegram] Since the Laishui Party member cadres' study expansion meeting in May, the county party committee has equipped each district committee with two propaganda committee members who have strong working abilities and higher levels of education. One person is responsible for branch education, and the other specializes in leading cadre study and communication work. Regarding cadre study, the county party committee promptly drafts specific study plans based on the current central work and important documents published by the Party Central Committee, determining different study centers for different periods. Over the months of June and July, the following achievements have been made: restoring the study organization and establishing a study system. All units have universally restored the organization of the propaganda and education committee since June. Based on the level of education and work area, study groups were organized (cadres going to the countryside used work groups as study groups). Everyone fully subscribed to study notebooks, and the group leader checked the notes at any time. In addition to adhering to two hours of study every day, four days were set aside each month as study days. Two centralized sessions are held, each lasting two days, for collective study and research on Party policies. For example, after studying documents such as "Reprint of the Preface to Chapter Two of 'Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder'," Comrade Yang Tian, ​​educational instructor of the Sixth District, examined himself and said: "When I returned from supporting the front, I didn't ask for leave, and I went home halfway. I must correct this kind of disorganized and undisciplined behavior in the future." Assistant Zhao of the Seventh District said: "When I went to Nankuan Village to work in the countryside, the masses urgently asked me to solve their problems. But I was too lazy and secretly came back early in the morning. This is the biggest mistake of not caring about the masses and being divorced from the masses." After the county's cadre expansion meeting, the Fifth District formally established a propaganda and education committee and set up a bulletin board question-and-answer column to guide everyone's study. The First District established a club, driven by the propaganda section to promote comprehensive study. The Seventh District even specially cleaned up a room as a study room. Every morning and on study days, all cadres come to the study room to collectively study and research documents, overcoming the previous free-flowing phenomenon. In July, everyone's enthusiasm for study was even higher. Some cadres of the county committee didn't even take a nap in order to study the documents. They were reluctant to put down the documents even when the meal bell rang in the morning. During this period, all in-service cadres further familiarized themselves with the Party's policies, and the confused ideas of the past, such as the old cadres not being bold enough in their work, and the new cadres being afraid of setbacks, afraid of transfers, and unwilling to work, have been largely resolved. Therefore, despite the cadres' illnesses and frequent transfers, they still led the masses to complete the arduous tasks of production, disaster relief, and supporting the front lines. Moreover, most worker-peasant cadres unanimously reflected: "Since we have grasped the study firmly, we feel that there are more methods in our work."

　　恢复组织，建立制度
  　涞水干部学习获成绩
    【北狱电】涞水党员干部学习，自五月扩干会后，县委即对各区分委配备了两个工作能力较强，文化程度较高的宣传委员。一人负责支部教育，一人专门领导干部学习和通讯工作。关于干部学习方面，根据当前的中心工作，和党中央发表的重要文件，由县委及时的拟出具体的学习计划，不同时期确定不同的学习中心，六、七两月来，获得以下成绩：恢复了学习组织，建立起学习制度。各单位从六月份都普遍的恢复了宣教委员会的组织。根据程度和工作地区，组织了学习小组。（下乡干部以工作组为学习小组）每人全订了学习笔记本，由组长随时检查笔记，除每天坚持两小时学习外，每月还抽出四天时间，作为学习日。集中两次，每次学习两天。集体学习和研究党的政策。如学了“重印左派幼稚病第二章前言”等文件后，六区教导员杨田同志检查自己说：“我支前回来，没请假，半路上就回家去了，这种无组织无纪律的行为，今后一定要改正。”七区赵助理员说着：“到南款村下乡，群众迫切要求我给他们解决问题。可是我嫌麻烦，就起早儿偷着回来了。这是不关心群众，脱离群众的最大错误。”五区从县扩干会后，就正式成立了宣教委员会，设立了墙报问答栏等领导大家学习。一区则成立了俱乐部，由宣传股推动全面学习。七区更专门收拾一间房子为学习室，每天早晨和学习日，全体干部一律到学习室来集体学习，研究文件。克服了以往的自流现象。在七月份中，大家的学习情绪更高涨了，县委会有的干部，为了研究文件，连午觉都不睡。早晨打吃饭钟还舍不得放下文件。这一期间，全体在职干部，进一步熟悉了党的政策，过去旧干部工作不大胆，新干部怕碰钉子，怕调动，不愿工作等混乱思想，已大体上解除。因而在干部多病和频繁的调动下，仍然领导群众完成了生产渡荒和支援前线的艰巨任务。而且大部工农干部，一致反映：“自从抓紧了学习，觉着工作上办法也多了。”
