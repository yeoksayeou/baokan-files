[Jilu Yu Electric Dispatch] Liaoyang is rectifying the work of the market trade, abolishing the evil practices of "secret language" and "touching codes," and eliminating obstacles to free trade. According to investigations, the bad systems of dark transactions and exploitation of both sellers and buyers in various markets in the past still exist seriously today. In the livestock trade, "secret language" is used to make deals. The traders change the ten numbers into: Ding One, Ci Two, Pin Three, etc., so that people who sell and buy livestock do not know the details, so as to make money from them. Grain and cotton traders also use secret codes to make the masses suffer losses. Cloth traders do not use a ruler to measure but casually use hand measurements. Other miscellaneous trades also make money in secret. For example, the Shatu Market traders secretly use pig and sheep fees. The main reasons for these problems are the legacy of the bad habits of the old society and the bureaucratic work style of industrial and commercial workers who do not conduct in-depth inspections and corrections. Recently, these ugly and dark secrets of exploitation were exposed at the trader's conference, and bad ones were criticized and educated, and a few very bad ones were suspended from their positions as traders. Active traders were mobilized to reflect on how they had let down the masses in the past, and secret codes were abolished. Standard scales and rulers were set up in each city and placed in the middle of each trade, allowing the masses to freely weigh and measure. Livestock traders are not allowed to speak "secret language" or "touch codes." For cotton and retail sales of cloth not exceeding fifteen feet, and grain not exceeding thirty jin, no handling fees are allowed.

(Editor's note: Regarding transaction fees, they should be implemented in accordance with the regulations of the Border Government, that is, no transaction fee should be paid for transactions not completed through traders, and a certain transaction fee should be paid for transactions completed through traders. It should not be simply stipulated based on the transaction quantity.)

　　废除“黑话”“摸码”恶习
  　聊阳整顿交易工作
    【冀鲁豫电】聊阳整顿集市交易工作，废除“黑话”“摸码子”恶习，扫除贸易自由障碍。据调查，各集市上过去黑暗成交，剥削卖货与买货双方的不良制度，今天仍然严重存在。在牲口行用“黑话”成交，交易员把十个数目字变成：丁一、次二、品三等等，不叫卖买牲口的人知道底细，以便从中使钱。粮行、棉花行也是用暗码办法，使群众吃亏。布行交易员不用尺量随便用手丈量。其它杂行也暗中使钱。如沙土集交易员暗中使用猪羊费。产生这些毛病的主要原因，是旧社会恶习遗留和工商工作者官僚主义作风不深入检查纠正所致。最近把这些剥削人的丑恶黑幕在交易员大会上揭发出来，对坏的批评教育，个别很坏的停止交易员职务。发动积极交易员，反省过去如何对不起群众，废除黑码。各市设置了标准秤尺，放在各行中间，群众自由去秤量。牲口行不准说“黑话”，“摸码子”。棉花，零买零卖的布不超过十五尺的，粮食不超过三十斤的，一律不准抽手续费。
