　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. A dispatch from Amsterdam on the 23rd via Electric Communication Agency: The newly appointed General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, the well-known and experienced Musso, delivered an important statement on the policies of the reorganized Indonesian Communist Party at a mass meeting in Madiun (formerly translated as Maidi'en) ten days before the workers took over the city. Musso was expelled from the country by the Dutch in 1926. His return has made a deep impression on the people. It is said that 90,000 people attended the meeting. Musso frankly condemned the Republic's government's attempt to compromise with the Dutch and Americans. He declared: "We do not recognize the truce agreement, nor do we recognize the Renville Agreement." By accepting the American "mediation" proposal, Hatta is once again allowing the country to fall into a colonial status. Musso pointed out that the Indonesian revolution is only the beginning of a national revolution, not a socialist revolution or a communist revolution. Although the revolution has been going on for three years, workers, farmers, women, and youth have not enjoyed the fruits of the national revolution. He continued: This is due to "mistakes made at the beginning, and the Communist Party also made mistakes." He said: "Externally, we firmly oppose imperialism, but internally, we maintain certain old conventions and remnants of feudalism, so there is no sign of new democracy." As a result, the leadership of the revolution fell into the hands of the propertied class, while the working class was completely excluded. After narrating the examples of the Soviet Union and New Democracy, Musso stated: The leadership of the country must be handed over to progressive workers, land will be equally distributed, and new village chiefs must be elected from poor farmers. He said: "In our revolution, the Dutch colonial army is our enemy. But if there are those among our Indonesian people who oppose the realization of the national revolution, we will classify them in the same category as the Dutch." The Communist Party is ready to cooperate with other political parties, provided they have the courage to fight against the Dutch reactionaries. When he spoke of the world being divided into two camps, peace and imperialism, he said, "Can we remain neutral in the struggle between the two camps? Absolutely not. We must choose the anti-imperialist camp." Musso pointed out that there are now 130,000 Dutch troops in Indonesia. "But compared with 70 million people—from whom our soldiers come—what does this number count for?" He urged the workers to train themselves to defend the Republic. He called for close cooperation with the people in the Dutch-occupied areas and declared his confidence in liberating those Republic territories that have been seized.

　　印尼共产党总书记发表演说
  　声述目前党的政策
    革命领导权应归于工人阶级
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】电通社阿姆斯特丹二十三日电：印尼共产党新任总书记、闻名而有经验的穆索，于工人接管茉莉芬（前译为马地恩）前十日，在该城群众大会上发表关于改组后的印尼共产党政策的重要声明。穆索在一九二六年曾被荷兰驱逐出境。他的归来，给予人民深刻的印象。据称：参加这次会议的群众达九万人。穆索率直地谴责共和国政府企图与荷美妥协。他宣称：“我们不承认停战协定，也不承认伦维尔协定。”由于接受美国“调处”建议，哈达正再次使国家沦陷到殖民地地位。穆索指出：印尼革命只是民族革命的开始，这不是社会主义革命或共产主义革命。虽然革命已有三年，但工人、农民、妇女与青年却享受不到民族革命的果实。他继称：这是由于“在开始时犯了错误，共产党也犯了错误”。他说：“对外我们坚决反对帝国主义，但对内我们却保持某些旧的成规和封建主义的残余，因此还没有新民主主义的迹象。”结果革命的领导权落到有产阶级的手里，而工人阶级却完全被排斥在外。穆索在叙述苏联与新民主主义的例子之后称：国家的领导权必须交到进步的工人手里，土地将予平分，新村长须自贫苦农民中选出。他说：“在我们的革命中，荷兰殖民军是我们的敌人。但假若在我们印尼人民中间有反对实现民族革命的那些人，我们必将他们与荷兰人划归一类。”共产党准备与其他政党合作，假如他们有勇气与荷兰反动派作战的话。他在谈及世界分裂为和平与帝国主义两个阵营时，说道：“在两个阵营的斗争中，我们能够保持中立吗？绝对不能。我们必须选择反帝阵营。”穆索指出：现在印尼有荷军十三万。“但若与七千万人——我们的士兵即来自其中——相较，这个数目又算得什么？”他敦促工人们为保卫共和国而锻炼自己。他呼吁与荷占区人民密切合作，并宣布有信心解放那些被夺去的共和国领土。
