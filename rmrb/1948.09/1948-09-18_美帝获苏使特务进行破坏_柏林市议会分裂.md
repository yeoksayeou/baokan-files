Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: TASS reports: The Berlin City Council has split due to sabotage by reactionaries. At the demand of the masses, the City Council was originally scheduled to meet at noon on the 6th of this month to discuss the United Socialist Party's proposal on preparations for Berlin citizens to get through the winter. When the meeting was about to begin on the day, reactionary members of the council and spies pre-arranged by the US side suddenly created disturbances in the meeting place. The director of the political department of the US military command attempted to forcibly close the gate and pushed workers in the guest seats out of the meeting place, intending to incite dissatisfaction among the workers outside the meeting to create riots, but the workers outside the meeting were not provoked. After the spies performed a riotous state, the reactionary speaker Suhr announced that the meeting was postponed indefinitely, and all democratic councilors expressed dissatisfaction with this despicable conspiracy. At 2:30 in the afternoon, Gerschke (United Socialist Party), in his capacity as vice-speaker, announced the opening of the meeting. Littek, chairman of the United Socialist Party caucus, stood up and spoke, condemning the reactionaries for evading discussion of the winter preparations plan. Brand, chairman of the executive committee of the Christian Democratic Party, also issued a statement saying, "If the majority of the current city council is unwilling to express the interests of the people, responsible individuals outside the current city council must unite and come forward to serve as representatives of the people of Berlin." At 6:30 in the afternoon, reactionary councilors who insisted on an anti-people stance actually stole the name of the "Berlin City Council" and held their so-called "Berlin City Council" meeting in a venue that had been well-prepared in the British-occupied area, and "resolved" to hold the Berlin city election on November 14. Thus, the Berlin City Council split.

　　美帝获苏使特务进行破坏
  　柏林市议会分裂
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社报导：柏林市议会由于反动派的破坏已告分裂。市议会在群众要求之下，原定于本月六日正午举行会议，以讨论统一社会党所提关于柏林市民过冬的准备计划。临到当日会议将开始时，由议会反动派及美方所预先布置的特务分子，突然捣乱会场，美军司令部政治部主任企图强行将大门关闭，并将来宾席上的工人推出会场，意欲激起会外工人群众的不满以制造骚乱，但会外工人群众不为挑拨所动。在特务分子表演作骚乱状态以后，反动派议长苏尔即宣布会议无定期延期，各民主议员对此卑劣阴谋均表不满。下午二时半，格什克（统一社会党）以副议长身份宣布开会，统一社会党党团主席立特克起立发言，斥责反动派逃避讨论过冬准备的计划。基督教民主党委执委会主席勃兰德亦发表声明称，“如本届市议会的多数派不愿表达人民的利益，则本届议会以外的负责的各个人必须团结起来，并出而担任柏林人民的代表。”下午六时半，坚持反人民立场的反动派议员，竟盗用“柏林市议会”名义在英占区早已布置妥善的会场内举行其所谓“柏林市议会”会议，并“决议”于十一月十四日举行柏林市选。至此柏林市议会乃告分裂。
