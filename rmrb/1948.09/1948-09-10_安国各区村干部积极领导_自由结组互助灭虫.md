[Jizhong Electric] After pests were discovered in over fifty villages in the Third, Fourth, and Seventh Districts of Anguo County, cadres from each district immediately led the masses to actively capture and kill them. In mobilizing the masses and in the methods of capture, there were generally the following two types: (1) Organized and led implementation. For example, the Fourth District organized an insect-fighting command post, divided into three sub-districts, with one sub-district forming an insect-fighting brigade, and sub-district cadres serving as captains. Villagers freely combined to form insect-catching teams, with three teams forming a squad, and the entire village forming an insect-catching detachment, with village cadres serving as detachment leaders, squad leaders, and team leaders. The village branch educated party members to play a backbone role. For example, after armyworms were discovered in Beilou Village, the branch immediately held a branch meeting, calling on party members to actively catch insects. On the 19th, under the leadership of the branch, all 147 households in the village mobilized 548 people to catch insects, including 180 women. When catching insects, most villages had their own groups fight their own plots, but some groups that had finished their own plots also helped other groups, implementing mutual aid and labor exchange. Song Luokuan, from Beibao Village, had a very awkward temper. This time, he resolutely refused to join the mutual aid group to catch insects. Later, he had too many insects in his field to handle, so he automatically joined the group. Everyone helped him for a day, and more than half of the insects were killed. He happily said, "I know now that organized mutual aid is powerful." (2) Using facts to break superstition. When armyworms were first discovered, some backward people said they were "god insects" that would "leave after they had eaten enough" and that "the more you kill, the more there will be." Song Guanghe, from Songjia Village, burned paper money for the insects in his grain field, but the more he burned, the more insects there were. Seeing that his crops were about to be ruined, he anxiously said, "I think it's better to beat them than to respect them!" The whole family went to the field and managed to kill some of the insects. Li Laowen, from Nanbao Village, burned paper money for the insects. Later, seeing that others were killing fewer and fewer insects, while his field had more and more, he anxiously started beating them too. The leadership seized this fact and used the village blackboard newspapers and radio stations to publicize it, and many superstitious people stopped being superstitious. (3) Mobilizing women to participate in insect catching. Wang Ru, from Qudi Village, held a family meeting as soon as there were armyworms in her field, mobilizing all the women in the family to go to the field to kill insects, and the crops were not damaged. Beilou Village mobilized 180 women, and the Fifth Village of Chengguan mobilized 24 women. Female cadres such as Bu Yinxia took the lead in capturing and killing insects, influencing more than 20 women to go to the fields to capture and kill them. They all said, "Look at them not being afraid of insects and not minding the dirt. What are we afraid of!" Under the active leadership of the cadres and the capture and killing by the masses, the county's insect-catching work has achieved initial results. On the morning of the 17th, Liushuang Village in the Fourth District mobilized 320 people, organized 28 groups, and worked on 148 mu. In the afternoon, 415 people were mobilized, 34 groups, and 240 mu were worked on. On the 17th, Zhangzhuang Village mobilized 159 people, 13 groups, and worked on 173 mu. After one or two days of such organized capture and killing, the insects have been greatly reduced. Beiyang Village has reduced by three-quarters, and Beihuazhuang has reduced by two-thirds. According to the statistics of the Fourth District on the 17th, thirteen villages organized 291 insect-fighting groups, with a total of 2,749 people. According to the statistics of eleven villages, a total of 1,242 mu of insects were killed.

　　安国各区村干部积极领导
  　自由结组互助灭虫
    【冀中电】安国三、四、七区五十来村，先后发现害虫后，各区干部立即领导群众积极捕打。在动员群众和捕打方法上，一般有以下两种：（一）有组织有领导的进行。如四区组织了一个打虫指挥所，下分三个小区，一个小区为一个打虫大队，小区干部当队长。各村群众自由结合组成捕虫小组，三个小组为一班，全村组成捕虫分队，村干部任分队长、班长和组长。村支部则教育了党员起骨干作用。象北楼村发现黏虫后，支部马上召开了支部会，号召党员积极捕虫。十九日，在支部领导下，全村一百四十七户，就发动了五百四十八人捕虫，其中妇女一百八十名。捕虫时，各村大都是自已组打自己组的，但有的组打没了自己的还帮助别组打，实行互助拨工。北堡村宋洛宽脾气挺蹩扭，这次打虫他坚决不参加互助组，后来他地里虫子太多拿不过来，才自动入了组，大家帮助他一天就把虫子打了多一半。他欢喜的说：“我可知道组织起来互助力量大了。”（二）用事实打破了迷信。开始发现黏虫时，有的落后群众说是“神虫”，“吃够了日子就走了”，“越打越多”。宋贾村宋广合的谷地里有了虫子，他却给虫子烧纸，可是越烧虫子越多，眼看庄稼快吃坏了。他才着急的说：“我看敬它不如打它！”全家都下地，才把虫打少了。南堡村李老文给虫子烧纸，后来见人家越打越少，他地里越来越多，他也着急的打起来。领导上抓住这个事实，利用各村黑板报、广播台进行宣传，好多迷信的群众才不迷信了。（三）发动妇女参加捕虫。曲堤村王汝与地里刚一有黏虫，就开了家庭会，动员了全家妇女下地打虫，庄稼没有受害。北楼村发动了一百八十名妇女，城关第五村发动了二十四名妇女。该村妇女干部卜银霞等四人带头捕打，影响的二十多个妇女也下地捕打。都说：“看人家不怕虫，不嫌脏，咱怕什么！”在干部积极领导群众捕打下，该县捕虫工作已获初步成绩。四区流双村十七日前半晌，就发动了三百二十人，组织二十八个小组，打了一百四十八亩。后半晌，发动了四百一十五人，三十四个组，打了二百四十亩。张庄村十七日发动群众一百五十九人，十三个组，打了一百七十三亩。这样有组织的捕打了一两天，虫子已大大减少。北洋村已减少四分之三，北化庄减少三分之二。据四区十七日一天统计，十三个村组织了二百九十一个打虫组，共二千七百四十九人。据十一个村统计，共打虫一千二百四十二亩。
