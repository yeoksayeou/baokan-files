Determining Land Rights, Developing Production
  Luancheng Begins Issuing Land Certificates
    [Report from this newspaper] The work teams dispatched by the Luancheng County Party Committee to Xi'an Village and Dongying Village have now completed the work of issuing land certificates. The process of their work is introduced as follows:
    The first difficulty encountered was the disunity of cadres. The main cadres of Dongying Village were all old cadres who were reinstated after rectification. For example, Feng Xiaofu, the former chairman of the Farmers' Association and current security officer, said: "We can't even get the representatives to a meeting. We used to move their stones, but how did they move ours back then?" The work team held a meeting of cadres to resolve the contradictions, and then overcome the cadres' fear of delaying production. Cadres in Xi'an Village said: "We are so busy now, the crops are so high, and issuing land certificates requires measuring the land, which is impossible." However, the masses had long been looking forward to the issuance of land certificates, so they approached the cadres and said: "If our village doesn't do it, the county and district cadres will go to other villages." The work team also explained the important relationship between issuing land certificates and developing production. Under this persuasion from above and below, the cadres' thinking changed.
    Secondly, publicize and mobilize, and establish a land committee. The Dongying Land Committee, under the leadership of the Farmers' Representative Conference, is chaired concurrently by Feng Youza, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, and has four sections: publicity, surveying, evaluation, and secretariat. The publicity section posted notices, convened mass meetings, explained the significance and methods of issuing land certificates, and solicited opinions from the masses. After the meeting, there were many discussions, and the notice was surrounded by viewers, with the middle peasants being the most active. The twenty mu of land left over from the equal distribution, no one wanted it at first, but now many people came to ask for it. The middle peasant Li Xiaowen said that he worked hard and was willing to have a few mu of land. In addition to giving him four mu, the Land Committee distributed the rest to poor and hired peasants with labor power.
    Third, combine rectification with yield assessment and distribute land certificates. Some of the yields set during the equal distribution of land were unreasonable and not based on the geological output. Under the one-sided idea that poor peasants should take advantage of everything, and in order for the poor peasants to bear less burden, some yields were determined according to class status. For example, a piece of land belonging to the middle peasant Qiu Xiao in Xi'an Village was sandwiched between the land of two poor peasants. Because he worked well and harvested more grain, and the soil quality was the same, his yield was set as first class, while the adjacent land was set as second class. This time, the unfairness was completely corrected based on soil quality and yield. Then it was reviewed and approved at the group meeting, and then submitted to the Land Committee for registration and listing, soliciting opinions, and correcting errors.
    Hand over old documents and issue land certificates. The main thing was to break the orthodox ideology. Some said: "These old deeds have not been changed for so many years, and whoever comes along honors them." Many people said that they had no documents, and some took out a few and kept a few, always reluctant to hand them over. After repeated explanations and mutual discussions, their thinking was changed, and they handed them over. Xi'an Village finally held a village meeting, announcing the end of the equal distribution, that all past red and white documents and contracts were null and void, and that everything would be done according to the new land certificates. It called on everyone to produce well in the future and get rich.

    Editor's note: The biggest shortcomings in Luancheng's issuance of land certificates are abandoning the branch and failing to resolve the unity of the new and old cadres. The Xi'an Village material said: "The cadres in this village are not responsible for each other, and the branch is not functioning... In order to work well, a land committee was established." It also said: "Various organizations were not well utilized to complete this work." The Dongying work team said: "In the work, the cadres made the mistake of being eager for quick success, and failed to grasp the handling of cadre problems as soon as they arrived in the village, so the work was not very smooth from beginning to end." Without relying on the branch and resolving the unity of the new and old cadres, the branch will never function, the cadre problem will always exist, and once the work team leaves, all work will be impossible to carry out. The role of the branch and the cadre problem must be further improved and resolved in every specific work. Otherwise, it is repeating the mistake of "abandoning the old organization."

### 确定地权，发展生产　栾城开始发土地证

　　确定地权，发展生产
  　栾城开始发土地证
    【本报讯】栾城县委派往西安庄与东营村的工作组，现已完成颁发土地证工作。兹将其工作经过，介绍如下：
    首先遇到的困难问题，是干部不团结。东营村主要干部都是纠偏后复职的老干部，如前任农会主任现任治安员冯小赋说：“代表们开会叫不到，咱们就搬他们的石头，怎么那时候他们搬咱们哩。”工作组召开了干部会，解决矛盾，接着打通干部怕耽误生产的思想。西安庄干部说：“现在这么忙，庄稼这么高，发土地证还得量地，那可没法做”。而群众早就盼着发土地证，即找干部说：咱村要不做，人家县区干部就到别的村去了。工作组也说明发土地证对于发展生产重要关系。在这种上下劝说之下，干部思想才转变过来。
    其次，宣传动员，建立土地委员会。东营土地委员会在农代会领导下，主任由农会主任冯右杂兼任，下设宣传、丈量、评议、秘书四股。宣传股张贴布告，召开群众大会，说明发土地证的意义与办法，征求群众的意见。会后议论纷纷，布告被观众包围了起来，中农最为活跃。平分时剩下的二十亩地，没有人要，现在好多人来问，中农李小稳说自己劳动多，愿意要几亩地，土委会除给他四亩外，其余的都分给了有劳动力的贫雇农。
    第三、结合纠偏评产量，分发土地证。平分土地时定的产量有的不合理，没有根据地质产量来定，在贫农什么也得占便宜的片面思想支持下，为了贫农少拿负担，有的竟按成份定产量。如西安庄中农秋小的一块地，夹在两个贫农的地中间，因他劳动好，粮食打的多，土质都是一样，但产量定为一等，邻地定为二等。这次根据土质产量，将不公平的完全纠正过来。接着在小组会上审查通过，然后交土地委员会登记列榜，征求意见，修正错误。
    交出旧文书，发给土地证。主要的是打破正统思想，有的说：“这么多年老契都没有换过，什么人过来都顶事。”很多人都说没文书了，有的拿出几张，留下几张，总是不愿交出来。经过反复解释与互相酝酿，打通了思想，才交出来。西安庄最后开了一个村民大会，宣布平分结束，过去红白文书契约一律作废，按新土地证办事。号召今后好好生产，发财致富。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：栾城发土地证中最大的缺点是抛开支部，以及没有解决新老干部的团结问题。西安庄材料说：“这个村干部互不负责，支部也不起作用………为了很好工作，才建立了一个土地委员会”。又说：“没有很好利用各种组织来完成此工作”。东营工作组说：“工作中干部犯了急于求成，一到村未抓住干部问题的处理，工作从始到终不很顺利。”不依靠支部，不解决新老干部团结问题，支部永不起作用，干部问题永远存在，工作组一走，一切工作无从进行。支部作用，干部问题，必须在每一件具体工作中进一步的提高与解决。否则就是重复了“抛开老组织”的错误。
