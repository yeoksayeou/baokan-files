　　After Three Years of Hard Work
  　A Pharmaceutical Factory Manufactures Sulfanilamide
    [This Newspaper] Sulfanilamide is one of the most important medicines for war wound surgery. A certain pharmaceutical factory, under the direction of technician Yang Taishan, has finally achieved preliminary success in manufacturing it after nearly three years of effort. It is expected that mass production for the front lines will be possible in another six months to a year. The manufacturing process of sulfanilamide is very complex, involving ten steps from raw materials to finished products. Sulfanilamide had already been manufactured shortly after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, but at that time, many key raw materials had to be sourced from abroad, resulting in limited progress for a long time. With the continuous victories of the Liberation War, favorable conditions were created for the research work. The leadership also made the greatest determination, replenishing personnel and equipment. All personnel of the pharmaceutical factory were mobilized in high gear. Technician Yang and his assistants often worked day and night continuously. Other technicians, assistants, and workers also actively participated. Other production departments, as long as it was possible, always prioritized the allocation of good machines, parts, and materials to the sulfanilamide research, ensuring the smooth progress of this work. The sulfanilamide manufactured by the factory now, according to chemical inspection results, is comparable to that manufactured abroad. Efforts will continue to be made to mass produce it in the future.

　　经三年努力研究
  　某药厂制成磺胺
    【本报讯】磺胺是战伤外科中最重要的一样药，某药厂在技师杨太山同志主持下，经过将近三年的努力，终于初步的制造成功了，预计再经过半年至一年，即可大量供应前方。磺胺的制造手续很复杂，从原料到成品，一共要经过十个步骤。远在抗战胜利后不久，就已经制成了磺胺，可是那时很多主要原料都得从外边来，以致长时没有很大进展。随着解放战争的不断胜利，给研究工作造成了有利条件，领导上也下了最大的决心，充实人员器材，药厂全厂人员也都紧张的动员起来，杨技师和他的助手们，常常不分白天夜晚，连着工作。其他技师和助手、工人也都积极参加。其他生产部门，只要做得到，总是把好的机器、零件和材料等尽先让给研究磺胺用，使得这一工作顺利进行。现在该厂所制成的磺胺，经化学检查结果，和外国制造的不相上下，今后当继续努力以便大量的制造出来。
