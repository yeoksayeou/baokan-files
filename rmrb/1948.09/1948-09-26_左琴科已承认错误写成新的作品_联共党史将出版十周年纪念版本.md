　　Soviet Publishing Briefs
　　△The "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks): Short Course" will be published in a commemorative edition this year to celebrate its tenth anniversary. This is one of the best-selling books in the world. In the past ten years, 63 language versions have been published in the Soviet Union, totaling 208 editions, with a total circulation of 35 million copies, all of which have been sold out. In addition to the languages of the Soviet nationalities, there are 17 foreign language translations.
　　△The total number of books issued by the Soviet State Publishing House in the first half of this year has reached 73 million copies, which greatly exceeds the pre-war figures. Among them, novels accounted for 10 million copies, and the works that won the 1947 Stalin Prize were particularly popular. The two-volume "Collection of Documents and Materials on the Eve of the Second World War," compiled by the Soviet Information Bureau, was published in 200,000 copies and has been completely sold out.
　　△Since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has published 26,500 kinds of children's books, with a total circulation of 700 million copies. In the twelve months before August, 1,100 kinds of children's books were published, totaling 40 million copies. The State Publishing House for Children's Literature, established fifteen years ago at Gorky's initiative, plans to publish 32 million copies of books this year, an increase of one-third over last year, including "Travels of an Atom," written by the famous children's science writer Ilyin.
　　△Soviet writers are the writers with the most readers in the world. Sholokhov's novels "Quiet Flows the Don" and "Virgin Soil Upturned" have 59 translations in 17 countries. Alexei Tolstoy's works have 70 translations in 16 countries. Ehrenburg's works have 87 translations in 26 countries. Simonov's "Days and Nights" sold 400,000 copies in the United States alone, and the Chicago Sun praised it as "the most outstanding work depicting war."
　　△Zoshchenko, a Soviet writer who was severely criticized by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) two years ago for making serious mistakes in his creative thinking, has admitted and corrected his mistakes. Last year, he wrote a new novel dedicated to the Leningrad guerrillas, and this year he wrote a play satirizing American bourgeois morality.
　　△"New Times," an authoritative publication reflecting Soviet foreign policy, was originally a bi-monthly publication. Since it was changed to a weekly publication on New Year's Day last year, the length has remained the same, and four versions in Russian, English, French, and German are published simultaneously.
　　△The Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences published a new magazine in early March this year, edited by Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences, Ostrovitianov, with economists such as Varga, Varga, Vazhlov, and Gladkov serving as editorial board members. It is an authoritative magazine for studying Soviet and foreign economic issues.

    苏联出版简讯
    △联共（布）党史简明教程，今年将出版纪念版本，以庆祝其出版十周年。这是全世界最畅销的书籍之一。十年来在苏联已出版了六十三种文字的版本，共二百零八版，总发行量达三千五百万册，已完全售罄。在苏联各民族语言以外，尚有十七种外国文译本。
    △苏联国家出版局今年上半年发行书籍总额已达七千三百万册，已大大超过战前数字。其中小说占一千万册，得到一九四七年斯大林奖金的创作尤为畅销。苏联情报局编纂之两巨册“第二次世界大战前夕文件资料汇编”，计出版二十万部，已全数售罄。
    △自从十月革命以来，苏联已出版儿童读物二万六千五百种，发行总量达七亿册。八月份以前的十二个月中，即发行儿童读物一千一百种，共四千万册。十五年前应高尔基的倡议而设立的儿童读物国家出版局，今年计划出版书籍三千二百万册，较去年增加三分之一，其中有著名儿童科学读物作家伊林所著的“原子旅行记”等。
    △苏联作家是全世界拥有最多读者的作家。萧洛霍夫的小说“静静的顿河”与“被开垦的处女地”，在十七个国家有五十九种译本。小托尔斯泰的作品在十六个国家有七十种译本。爱伦堡的作品在二十六个国家有八十七种译本。西蒙诺夫的“日日夜夜”单在美国即销出了四十万本，芝加哥太阳报誉之为“描写战争最杰出的作品”。
    △因为在创作思想上犯严重错误而于前年受到联共中央严厉批评的苏联作家左琴科，已经承认和进行改正其错误，去年曾写了一本奉献给列宁格勒游击队的新小说，今年又写成了一本讽刺美国资产阶级道德的剧本。
    △反映苏联外交政策权威刊物“新时代”，原来是半月刊，自去年元旦改成周刊以后，篇幅照旧，以俄文、英文、法文、德文同时发行四种版本。
    △苏联科学院经济研究院于今年三月初出版一种新杂志，由科学院通讯会员奥斯特洛维将诺夫任主编，瓦尔如、瓦兹洛夫、格拉德可夫等经济学家任编委，为研究苏联与外国经济问题的权威杂志。
