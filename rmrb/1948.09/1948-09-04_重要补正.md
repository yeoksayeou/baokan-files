　　Important Correction

　　In the top headline on page one of this newspaper on the 16th of last month, "North China People Elect Representatives," the first paragraph, from "successfully concluded by the end of the month" to "among them are local peasant leaders...", should be corrected as follows:

　　"A total of 567 representatives were elected (excluding 31 representatives hired by the government), including 301 regional representatives, 93 representatives of social notables, 35 representatives of workers and staff, 31 representatives of chambers of commerce, 50 women representatives, 35 representatives of the People's Liberation Army, 15 representatives of cultural circles, and 7 representatives of the Hui people."
