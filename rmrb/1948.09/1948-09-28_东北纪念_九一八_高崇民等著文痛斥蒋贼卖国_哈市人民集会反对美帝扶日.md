Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th: On the 17th anniversary of the "September 18th Incident," Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, Che Xiangchen, Minister of Education, Feng Zhongyun, Chairman of Songjiang Province, Zhou Baozhong, Chairman of Jilin Province, and others, all wrote articles based on their personal experiences, denouncing the Kuomintang government's betrayal of Northeast China and the whole of China, as well as the crimes of U.S. imperialism in supporting the Japanese invaders with weapons, scrap iron, gasoline, and other war materials. They also recounted the inhuman suffering endured by the people of Northeast China during the 14 years of Japanese occupation. They pointed out that only the Communist Party members stood with the people of Northeast China in their struggle at that time, and only the Soviet Union spoke out righteously in the international arena, condemning Japan's aggression and ultimately helping to liberate Northeast China with its powerful Red Army.

　　Vice Chairman Gao, in his article "If the Chiang Kai-shek Gang Doesn't Die, the National Crisis Won't End," concluded: "After August 15th, Chiang Kai-shek's only intention was to replace Japan with U.S. imperialism, turning China into a colony of U.S. imperialism, while he himself would replace Puyi and Wang Jingwei." He called on the people of Northeast China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to vigorously support the Liberation War, completely destroy the reactionary ruling structure of the Kuomintang gang, and establish a New Democratic Coalition Government.

　　Chairman Feng Zhongyun, formerly a leader of the Anti-Japanese United Army, said in his article "Recalling the Tragic Fourteen Years": For fourteen years, Northeast China was like a giant labor camp, prison, and execution ground. Tens of thousands of people from Northeast China were captured and massacred after being forced to build fortifications for the Japanese invaders. To deal with the Anti-Japanese United Army, the Japanese invaders adopted the "three alls" policy (kill all, burn all, loot all), consolidated villages, and established so-called "collective settlements." He said: Even now, various instruments of torture and remnants of killing machines abandoned by the Japanese invaders, as well as many "settlements," can still be found in various places. During this period, the Kuomintang government abandoned Northeast China, and Kuomintang officers such as Ma Zhanshan betrayed and surrendered to the enemy. Only the Communist Party members, under the guidance of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, maintained close ties with the people and fought bravely against the enemy in the deep mountains and forests.

　　General Zhou Baozhong, formerly a leader of the Anti-Japanese United Army, paid tribute in his article to the martyrs of the Chinese Communist Party and people's heroes Luo Dengxian, Yang Jingyu, Wei Zhengmin, Wang Detai, Li Zhaolin, and Li Qidong, and to the Soviet soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the liberation of Northeast China.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd: On the 17th anniversary of the "September 18th Incident," various agencies, organizations, factories, and schools in Harbin held meetings to commemorate the event. The Youth Workers Department of the Trade Union Federation and the Daowai Mao Zedong Youth League branch held lectures. Workers from the waterworks, telegraph, and telephone bureaus held forums to recall the "September 18th Incident." Various people's education centers exhibited materials commemorating the "September 18th Incident." The Daowai People's Education Center also exhibited photos of land reform, economic construction, army support, and victories in the revolutionary war in the liberated areas of Northeast China over the past three years. All newspapers also published special commemorative issues.

　　The Northeast Daily published an editorial on that day entitled "Oppose U.S. Imperialist Plot to Support Japan," pointing out that "resolutely overcoming all difficulties and striving for new and greater victories until the complete liberation of all of China" is the "only effective way for the Chinese people to oppose U.S. imperialism's support of Japan."

　　On the eve of the "September 18th" anniversary, the Officer Training Regiment of the Harbin PLA convened a forum of former Northeast Army officers. Everyone used their personal experiences to denounce the Kuomintang government's "non-resistance policy" and concrete facts of surrender and national betrayal during the "September 18th Incident," as well as Chiang Kai-shek's various oppressions and destruction of the Northeast Army to eliminate dissidents.

　　东北纪念“九一八”
    高崇民等著文痛斥蒋贼卖国
  　哈市人民集会反对美帝扶日
    【新华社东北二十六日电】“九一八”十七周年纪念日，东北政委会副主席高崇民、教育部长车向忱、松江省主席冯仲云、吉林省主席周保中等，均以亲身经历，撰文痛斥国民党政府出卖东北、出卖中国及美帝国主义以武器、废铁、汽油等作战物资支援日寇的罪行；他们并历数东北人民在日寇侵占下的十四年中，所遭受的种种非人世间的痛苦。他们指出：那时，只有共产党员和东北人民在一起坚持着斗争；也只有苏联，在国际上仗义执言，痛斥日本的侵略行动，并最后以强大红军帮助解放了东北。高副主席在“蒋匪帮不死，国难不止”一文结语中说：“八一五”后，蒋介石的唯一企图，就是要以美帝国主义代替过去的日本，使中国沦为美国帝国主义的殖民地，而他自己则代替溥仪和汪精卫。他号召东北人民在中国共产党领导下，努力支援解放战争，彻底摧毁国民党匪帮反动统治机构，建立新民主联合政府。原是抗日联军的领导者之一的冯仲云主席在“追忆惨痛的十四年”一文中说：十四年中，东北有如一座巨大的劳动营、监狱、刑场，成千成万的东北人民在被抓去为日寇建筑工事后被全部屠杀。为了对付抗日联军，日寇采取了三光政策，归屯并户，建立所谓“集团部落”。他说：直到现在，各地还可以发现日寇遗弃的各种刑具和杀人机器的残骸，以及不少“部落”。这期间，国民党政府把东北弃置不顾，国民党军马占山等叛变投敌，东北就只有共产党员在中共中央指示下，与人民紧密联系一起，在深山丛林中坚贞不屈地与敌人搏斗。前抗日联军领导者之一的周保中将军在文中向中共党员和人民英雄罗登贤、杨靖宇、魏拯民、王德泰、李兆麟、李启东等先烈和为解放东北而牺牲的苏联将士致敬。
    【新华社东北二十三日电】“九一八”第十七周年，哈尔滨市各机关、团体、工厂、学校，纷纷集会纪念。职工总会青工部及道外毛泽东青年团分团部，分别举行讲演会；自来水厂、电报、电话局等职工举行回忆“九一八”的座谈。各民教馆分别展览纪念“九一八”的各种材料。道外民教馆并展览东北解放区三年来土地改革、经济建设、参军支前、革命战争胜利等照片。各报亦均出版纪念特刊。东北日报于是日发表题为“反对美帝扶日阴谋”的社论，指出：“坚决克服一切困难，争取新的更大的胜利，直到全中国的完全解放”，是中国人民“反对美帝扶日的唯一有效的道路”。哈市解放军官教导团于“九一八”纪念日前夕，召开旧东北军军官座谈会。大家都以亲身的经历，控诉“九一八”时国民党政府“不抵抗主义”和投降卖国的具体事实，以及蒋贼对东北军实行消灭异己政策的种种压迫与摧残。
