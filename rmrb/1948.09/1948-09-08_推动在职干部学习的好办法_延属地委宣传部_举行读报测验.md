　　Good Way to Promote Learning Among On-the-Job Cadres
  　Yan'an Prefectural Party Committee Propaganda Department
  　Holds Newspaper Reading Test
Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 5th—The Yan'an Prefectural Party Committee Propaganda Department of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region held a newspaper reading test on the 13th of last month. The results proved that this is an important and effective method to promote learning among on-the-job cadres, and it is worthy of vigorous promotion and popularization. The subjects of the Yan'an Prefectural Party Committee Propaganda Department's test were county party secretaries, county magistrates, and district-level cadres who came to Yan'an for meetings. The test questions totaled twenty, all selected from the July and August issues of the *Masses Daily*, including the Party's policy instructions, important news from Yan'an Prefecture, and major events in the Liberated Areas, the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and internationally. The test results: out of a total of 103 people, only 29 passed, and 74 failed. The number of those who failed exceeded three-quarters.

　　The test shows that some departments and some cadres are very serious about reading and studying the Party newspaper, but most cadres (especially economic and financial cadres) and leading comrades in some counties have a very serious problem of not reading the Party newspaper seriously or regularly. The answers from 57 district party and government cadres and leading comrades from various counties reveal the following serious problems: First, not enough importance and research is given to the Party's policies and instructions from higher authorities. The fifth item of the "May 1st" Labor Day slogans issued by the Party Central Committee, namely, "All democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all enlightened people should promptly convene a political consultative conference to discuss and realize the convocation of a people's congress to form a democratic coalition government," has won the support of people from all democratic parties across the country. They sent telegrams to Chairman Mao, and the newspaper also published it in large print, but as many as 24 people could not answer the main content of the slogan. Only fourteen people answered correctly about the basic characteristics of the military situation in the second year of the Liberation War and the five important tasks in the third year, twenty-six people did not answer completely, and seventeen people answered completely wrong or left it blank. After the summary of the two-year Liberation War was published in the newspaper, the Prefectural Party Committee Propaganda Department notified all localities under its jurisdiction to require every cadre to memorize its main contents and figures so as to publicize it to the masses anytime and anywhere. The test results showed that twenty-one people did not answer completely or answered incorrectly regarding the names of the five major liberated areas and the current total population. As for the number of enemies annihilated in the past two years, forty-two people (seventeen in each county) also did not answer completely or left it blank. The news that the Border Government instructed all counties to gradually restore schools and social education was published on the front page of the newspaper, but twenty-three people (including nine leading comrades from various counties) did not know about the "government-subsidized, people-run" policy for restoring primary schools. Secondly, local news is ignored. Some comrades usually only read the war news from the Liberated Areas and major international events, and take a indifferent attitude towards the news from the Border Region that has practical guiding significance for their work. For example, Liu Jianzhang's three methods of combining wartime transport and production, which was published on the front page of the August 10th newspaper, was not known to forty-seven people. Third, some people said, "I have a bad memory, and I can't remember it after reading it once." But the main reason is that they don't pay enough attention to the newspaper ideologically, and they haven't developed the habit of reading it regularly. In addition, there are shortcomings in the method of reading the newspaper, and they can't grasp the important news published in the newspaper every day, use their brains, and think about how to connect it with their work. It just flows through like "water off a duck's back." In this way, some common sense news that has appeared repeatedly in the newspaper is ignored, and naturally "can't remember." For example, generally comrades say that they like war news, but they don't look at the map, don't distinguish between east, west, north, and south, and answer that Xiangyang in Hubei is in "Anhui" or "Shandong" province, Shijiazhuang in Hebei is in "Northeast," and the Sixth National Labor Congress held in Harbin is in "Kaifeng." The leaders of the Italian and Japanese Communist Parties were assassinated by the reactionaries, and Chairman Mao sent telegrams to express his condolences. Nearly half of the people "can't remember" their names. When asked which countries the European Intelligence Bureau was composed of, some even filled in five countries including China, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and India. In particular, the years in which our Party and our army were founded, which were commemorated not long ago, and which were also introduced in the newspapers, were "not remembered" by four people (Party members) for the former and eleven people for the latter.

　　This test has played a role in awakening and promoting comrades who usually do not pay attention to reading newspapers. Now they generally pay more attention to reading newspapers, and some have begun to take current affairs notes. In order to maintain this enthusiasm, the Prefectural Party Committee Propaganda Department has issued instructions based on the experience of this test: 1. In coordination with document study, stipulate that one morning of study time per week should be used to discuss current events; 2. In the future, district-level cadres will be given irregular tests; 3. After a certain period of time, send questions by letter to the leading comrades of each county, asking them about their learning situation and opinions on important news articles related to their work published in the newspaper, so as to help them develop the habit of reading newspapers, and through them, urge county and district cadres to pay attention to reading Party newspapers.

### 推动在职干部学习的好办法　延属地委宣传部　举行读报测验

　　推动在职干部学习的好办法
  　延属地委宣传部
  　举行读报测验
    【新华社西北五日电】陕甘宁边区延属地委宣传部于上月十三日举行了一次读报测验，结果证明这是推动在职干部学习的重要有效办法之一，值得大大提倡推广。延属地委宣传部此次测验对象是来延开会之县委书记、县长和分区级干部。测验题共二十条，都是从七月份八月份群众日报上选择的，包括党的政策指示，延属重要消息及解放区、国民党统治区和国际主要大事。测验结果：合计一百零三人，及格的仅二十九人，不及格的七十四人。不及格的超过了四分之三。
    从测验中可看出，一部分机关部门和一部分干部对党报的阅读研究还很认真，但大部分干部（特别是财经干部）和一些县的领导同志，在阅读党报中，不认真不经常的现象非常严重。从分区党政干部和各县领导同志五十七人的答案里可以看出下面几个严重问题：首先是重视与研究党的政策和上级指示不够。党中央颁发的“五一”劳动节口号第五项即“各民主党派、各人民团体、各社会贤达迅速召开政治协商会议，讨论并实现召集人民代表大会，成立民主联合政府。”一条，曾获得全国人民各民主党派人士的拥护，他们打了电报给毛主席，报纸也用大字登了出来，但竟有二十四人答不出该项口号的主要内容。解放战争第二年军事情况的基本特点和第三年的五个重要任务，只有十四人答对，二十六人答不完全，十七人全错或空白。两年解放战争的总结在报上发表后，地委宣传部曾通知所属各地，要每个干部熟记其主要内容和数字，以便随时随地向群众宣传。测验结果，五大解放区的名称和现有人口总数，有二十一人答得不完全或答错误。而两年来歼敌数目则有四十二人（各县十七人）也答得不完全或空白。边府指示各县逐渐恢复学校和社会教育工作的新闻，登在报纸第一版上，其中恢复初小的“民办公助”方针，还有二十三人（其中各县领导同志九人）不知道。其次是漠视地方新闻。若干同志平时只看解放区战讯和国际上的重大事件，对工作有实际指导意义的边区消息，采取漠不关心的态度。如八月十日报纸一版头条登载刘建章同志创造战勤运输和生产相结合的三个办法，就有四十七人不清楚。第三、有些人说：“记性不好，看过一遍记不住。”但主要是由于思想上对报纸不够重视，未养成经常阅读的习惯，再加上读报方法有缺点，不能抓住每天报上登载的重要消息，动动脑筋，和自己的工作连系起来想一想。只是“水过鸭背”似的流过去，这样，一些再三在报纸上出现过的新闻常识也熟视无睹，自然“记不住”。比如一般同志都说爱好战讯，但是不看地图，不分东南西北，把湖北的襄阳答在“安徽”或“山东”省，河北的石家庄答在“东北”，在哈尔滨开幕的第六次全国劳动大会答在“开封”，意大利和日本共产党的领袖曾被反动派阴谋刺伤，毛主席打了电报去慰问，近半数的人却“记不住”他们的名字。欧洲情报局是那些国家共产党组成的，竟然答项中有填中、英、美、荷、印等五国参加的。特别是我党和我军成立的年份，才开过纪念会不久，报纸也有介绍，前者有四人（党员）后者有十一人“记不住”了。
    这次测验，对于平时不注意看报的同志，起了惊醒和推动的作用，现在他们已经普遍地比较注意看报了，有的已开始做时事笔记。地委宣传部为使这种热情坚持下去，特根据这次测验经验，发出指示：一、配合文件学习，规定每周要以一个早上的学习时间漫谈时事；二、今后分区级干部举行不定期测验；三、经若干时日，函寄题目给各县领导同志，询问他们对于报上登载与工作有关的重要消息文章的学习情况和意见，以帮助他们养成看报习惯，经过他们再督促县区干部重视阅读党报。
