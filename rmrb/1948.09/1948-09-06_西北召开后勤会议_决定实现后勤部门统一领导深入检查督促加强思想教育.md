Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 1st: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-JinSui Joint Defense Military Region recently held a logistics work meeting, deciding to achieve unified leadership of logistics departments and concentrate all manpower, material resources, and financial resources in the rear to support the front and supply the needs of the field army. It was also decided to strengthen the Party's leadership and political work in the logistics departments.

The meeting was personally presided over by Commander He Long. In his summary of the meeting, he pointed out that the logistics work, under the difficult conditions of internal operations, disaster and famine, continuous expansion of the troops, and increasingly heavy supply tasks, has basically completed the task of supporting the front.

The shortcomings are that unified leadership has not been well implemented, the organizational strength has not been fully utilized, and therefore, the work steps are not coordinated enough, the spirit of adhering to various work systems is not enough, and there is a lack of timely in-depth inspection and supervision; there is a lack of planning and organization in the work, a lack of overall planning, and separate planning for urgency and importance in supply; ideological leadership is relatively weak, and there is a lack of serious criticism and education for the shortcomings of localism and underestimation of logistics work existing in the thinking of some cadres. There has been no active strengthening and improvement of the political understanding of cadres to further promote and improve logistics work.

Commander He pointed out that the Logistics Department of the Joint Defense Military Region is the command post for logistics work in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-JinSui. In the future, it should implement unified leadership for all logistics departments in the rear, establish the idea of fully relying on and giving play to the strength of the masses to overcome difficulties, and focusing everything on the victory of the war, concentrate all efforts to increase revenue and reduce expenditure to support the front.

The Party Affairs Committee should be established in the Logistics Department of the Joint Defense Military Region to strengthen the Party's leadership, improve the work of the branch, and ensure the progress and completion of logistics work. At the same time, the Political Office of the Logistics Department of the Joint Defense Military Region should be expanded into a Political Department to strengthen political work, promote democracy, educate and train cadres in a planned way, and improve the enthusiasm and creativity of each cadre. The Logistics Department of the Joint Defense Military Region should immediately and resolutely implement the "July 1st" study instructions of the Northwest Bureau, conscientiously organize political studies in the logistics system, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and overcome the unhealthy tendencies of localism, underestimation of logistics work, destruction of work systems, and damage to raw materials and resources.

　　西北召开后勤会议
  　决定实现后勤部门统一领导深入检查督促加强思想教育
    【新华社西北一日电】陕甘宁晋绥联防军区近召开后勤工作会议，决定实现后勤部门的统一领导，集中后方一切人力、物力、财力支援前线，供应野战部队的需要。并决定加强后勤部门的党的领导及政治工作。
    会议由贺龙司令员亲自主持。他在会议的总结中指出：后勤工作在内线作战、灾荒侵袭、部队不断扩大、供给日益繁重等困难的条件下，基本上完成了支前任务。
    缺点是没有很好的贯彻统一领导，没有充分发挥组织力量，因之，工作步骤不够协调，坚持各种工作制度的精神还不够，缺少及时的深入的检查与督促；缺乏工作的计划性与组织性，缺乏全盘筹划及分别缓急轻重的进行供给；思想领导比较薄弱，对于部分干部思想中存在的本位主义，轻视后勤工作等缺点，还缺少严肃的批评教育，没有从积极加强与提高干部的政治认识，更进一步推动与改进后勤工作。
    贺司令员指出：联防军区后勤部为陕甘宁晋绥后勤工作的指挥所，今后对于后方一切后勤部门应贯彻实现统一领导，树立充分依靠与发挥群众力量克服困难，和一切为着战争胜利的思想，集中全力开源节流支援前线。
    联防军区后勤部应成立党务委员会，加强党的领导，健全支部工作，保证后勤工作的进行与完成。同时扩大联防军区后勤政治处为政治部，加强政治工作，发扬民主，有计划的教育与培养干部，提高每个干部的积极性与创造性。联防军区后勤部，应即坚决执行西北局“七一”学习指示，认真组织后勤系统的政治学习，开展批评与自我批评，克服本位主义以及轻视后勤工作、破坏工作制度、损坏原料资材等无政府无纪律的不良倾向。
