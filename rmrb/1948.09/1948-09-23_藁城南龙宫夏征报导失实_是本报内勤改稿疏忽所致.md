　　False Report on Summer Grain Tax in Nanlong Palace, Gaocheng
　　Due to Careless Revision by Our Internal Staff

Comrades of the Editorial Department:
　　Upon seeing the news published in your newspaper on July 24th regarding the exemption of poor peasant league members from the summer grain tax burden in Nanlong Palace Village, Gaocheng County, we immediately notified the district to conduct an investigation. The next day, the district wrote a report stating, "There is no such matter in the summer grain tax collection." Still fearing inaccuracy, Director Zhao (Director of the Finance Section) personally went to the village yesterday for detailed inquiries. Today, we have confirmed the truth: the report in the newspaper likely confused the timing, or the source of the material was hearsay. The talk of exempting poor peasant league members from the grain tax burden during the wheat tax collection is completely inconsistent with the facts. Only this spring, when collecting the outstanding autumn grain tax, the village work team mistakenly announced at a meeting that poor peasant league members would be exempt from the burden. We promptly corrected this and reported it to the Commissioner's Office several times in meetings. Because the work team also made deviations in party rectification, no one among the new and old cadres is working, and the wheat tax distribution has not been properly allocated to households to this day. How did Wang Xiaogui get seven pieces of cloth? It must be that the writer carelessly brought up a past situation again, causing a major mistake. Please investigate thoroughly and correct it accordingly!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　County Magistrate of Gaocheng, Liu Xue

◇ Earlier this month, we received a letter from County Magistrate Liu Xue of Gaocheng, correcting the false report about the exemption of poor peasant league members from the summer grain tax burden in Nanlong Palace Village. In the middle of the month, we also received a report from Director Luo of the Border Government Administrative Office, along with a report from County Magistrate Liu Xue of Gaocheng to Commissioner Yang on this issue (identical to the above letter), after the Border Region Government Finance Department promptly telegraphed the Jizhong Administrative Office to send personnel to investigate and correct the matter based on the newspaper report. All stated that there was no exemption for poor peasant leagues in the village's summer grain tax collection this year. Originally, there was a period when poor peasant leagues were not exempt from the burden during the collection of the remaining autumn grain tax from last spring, which was immediately corrected. The news incorrectly wrote the mistake made during the autumn grain tax collection as a fact in the summer grain tax collection, which is incorrect. This material was written by our newspaper reporters Yao Fu and Huai Yu. The original spirit of the manuscript was based on the fact that the summer grain tax collection in the village was lagging behind, describing the past disunity of the branch and the work team's erroneous announcement during the autumn grain tax collection that poor peasant league members would be exempt from the burden, which had aroused dissatisfaction from all strata. At the beginning of the summer grain tax collection, no one in the village was responsible, and the poor peasant league chairman was acting alone, unable to even hold meetings, so the summer grain tax allocation could not be carried out. This situation is real, and the original manuscript written by Yao Fu and Huai Yu was not wrong. The cause of the error was that an assistant editor, when revising the manuscript, did not understand the original spirit, felt that the manuscript was not clear enough and did not grasp the key points, and did not write to inquire about it. They then mistakenly changed "autumn grain tax" to "summer grain tax," and our editorial department's various links were negligent in proofreading the original manuscript, resulting in an error that was inconsistent with the facts. In addition to conducting a profound self-criticism, we extend our apologies to the village cadres of the Gaocheng district. The Border Region Government, the Administrative Office, and the Commissioner's Office can seriously and quickly inspect the actual work problems reflected in the newspaper, and immediately inform us when they find facts that do not match, which is very beneficial to improving our work and improving the newspaper. We hereby express our thanks!

### 藁城南龙宫夏征报导失实　是本报内勤改稿疏忽所致

　　藁城南龙宫夏征报导失实
  　是本报内勤改稿疏忽所致编辑部诸同志：
    看到七月二十四日贵报登载我县南龙宫村夏征中，贫农团员不纳负担的新闻，我们即马上通知该区赶快考查，次日该区即写来报告说：“夏征中无有此事”；我们还尚恐不实，昨日赵科长（财政科长）又亲去该村详细查问，今日确实弄真，报上所载可能是把时间弄错，或材料的来源是道听途说。麦征中贫农团不纳负担之谈，完全与事实不符。仅今春征收秋征尾欠时，该村工作组误在大会上公布贫农团员不纳负担，早经我们作了纠正，并几度在会议上向专署作了报告。因为该工作组在整党方面也发生偏差，新老干部没人工作，到如今麦征布还没作对户分配。王小贵拿七块布是何从说起呢？这一定是写稿者把已过的情况，不慎重的又重新搬了出来，致造成大错，请详细考查，加以校正为荷！
    　　　　藁城县长　刘学
    ◇上月初我们接到藁城刘县长对南龙宫村夏征中贫农团员不纳负担报导失实的更正信，月中又接到两边府财政厅根据报纸登载这一消息迅电冀中行署派员前往调查纠正后，署罗主任的报告，并附有藁城刘县长给杨专员对此问题的报告（与上函同），都在说明该村今年夏征中贫农团并无不纳负担的事情。原在今春征收去年秋征尾欠中，贫农团曾有一度不纳负担，随即纠正，该新闻误将秋征中所犯错误写成了夏征中的事实是不对的。这一材料，系本报记者药夫、槐玉二同志所写，原稿精神系根据该村夏征落了后，叙述过去支部不团结，秋征中工作组错误宣布贫农团员不纳负担曾引起各阶层的不满；夏征开始，该村无人负责，贫农团主席一人光杆跳舞，连会也开不成，所以，夏征一直分配不下去。这种情况是真实的，药夫、槐玉二同志所写原稿并无错误。错误产生原因，系一助理编辑同志当修改这一稿件时，未曾体会原稿精神，认为该稿写得不够清晰，未抓住要害，又未去信问明，即将秋征误改为夏征，而我们编辑部门各个环节在审稿时又疏于对证原稿，以致造成与事实不符的错误。我们除作深刻检讨外，特向藁城区村干部同志致歉。边府、行署和专署，对报纸反映之下面实际工作问题能认真迅速进行检查，发现不符事实者，即来函告诉我们，这对改进工作与改进报纸都有很大好处，特在此一并致谢！
