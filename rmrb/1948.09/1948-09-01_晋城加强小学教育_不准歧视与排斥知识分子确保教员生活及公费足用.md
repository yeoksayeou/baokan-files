Taiyue News: The Jincheng County Government has made the following decisions to strengthen primary school education: (1) Villages are not allowed to arbitrarily increase teachers' burdens outside of teaching (such as assigning corvée labor or substitute farming). Teachers in the village are to be counted as part of the population, deducting the tax exemption point. (2) No individual, group, or organization is allowed to arbitrarily remove a school without the approval of the district or county government; primary school teachers and intellectuals are not allowed to be discriminated against or excluded by anyone as long as they abide by government laws and policies. (3) Primary school teachers are hired by the village and appointed by the county government. They may not be dismissed or transferred without government approval. (4) Ensure adequate teacher livelihood and public funds. According to the administrative office's regulations, the county government will allocate funds in a unified manner and issue them on time. (5) The county government will restore the Culture and Education Section and establish educational supervisors to strengthen leadership and establish central primary school districts to facilitate regular exchange of experiences. (6) Teaching should implement the principle of combining theory with practice and integrating learning with application; however, it is wrong to undertake unlimited work tasks and production tasks and turn the school into a work team or mutual aid group; it is also wrong to ignore the masses' production and demands, study books rigidly, and even cultivate students' contempt for labor. (7) Primary school teachers should strengthen their studies, subscribe to newspapers in all schools, observe and learn from each other, overcome the work style and viewpoint of being divorced from the masses and despising the masses, and actively cooperate with the work in the village. (8) County, district, and village meetings at all levels should include teachers as participants.

                                                                                                                                                                        (Wang Yi)

　　晋城加强小学教育
  　不准歧视与排斥知识分子确保教员生活及公费足用
    【太岳讯】晋城县府为加强小学教育工作，特作出如下决定：（一）村中不准随便加重教员教学以外的负担（如派差代耕等），教员在村中一律算人口，扣除免征点。（二）校址不经区县政府批准，任何个人团体机关不准随便把学校撵走；小学教员、知识分子在其遵守政府法令政策原则下，任何人不准加以歧视和排斥。（三）小学教员由村聘请，县府加委，非经政府批准，不得随便解聘与调动。（四）确保教员生活及公费足用，按照行署规定，由县府统筹统支按时发给。（五）县府恢复文教科，并设督学员，加强领导，建立中心小学区，以便经常交流经验。（六）教学上要贯彻理论与实践结合，学用一致的方针；但无限制的担任工作任务与生产任务，把学校变成工作队与互助组是错误的；不顾群众生产和要求，死读书甚至养成学生轻视劳动的观念，也是错误的。（七）小学教员要加强学习，各校普遍订报纸，互相观摩学习，克服脱离群众轻视群众的作风与观点，主动配合村里的工作。（八）县区村各级会议，要分别吸收教员参加。
