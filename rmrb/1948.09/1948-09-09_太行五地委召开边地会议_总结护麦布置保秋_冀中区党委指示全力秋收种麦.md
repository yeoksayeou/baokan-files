Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee Convenes Border Area Conference
	Summarize Wheat Protection and Deploy Autumn Harvest
	Jizhong District Party Committee Directs Full Effort for Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting
[Taihang Electric] In order to strive for greater victories in the autumn harvest struggle, the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a border area conference on August 14th. Cadres from eight border counties, districts, and villages attended. They held group discussions by county, starting with a bottom-up summary of the wheat protection struggle, and raised three issues that must be noted in carrying out the autumn harvest struggle: First, mobilizing the masses in border areas must be based on implementing the new policy of shifting from land reform to organizing and mobilizing the masses for production, and organizing and expanding the anti-Chiang Kai-shek united front for border area struggle against the enemy. Second, mass guerrilla warfare must be launched, with a clear understanding that border area struggle must rely on the masses and the forms and organization of guerrilla warfare appropriate to different areas. Third, mass struggle against the enemy must be launched in enemy-occupied areas, focusing on the large-scale development of mass armed forces and the bold work of winning over and disintegrating bandits and puppet personnel. After five days of group discussion and research, and typical speeches at the general assembly, five kinds of experiences were specifically summarized from the three issues, including the mass joint defense struggle in wheat protection, the elimination of no-man's-lands, the development of the struggle against the enemy based on production, and the winning over of secret society armed forces and the disintegration of enemy military hidden work. At the same time, our major weaknesses were also discussed, and specific arrangements were made for the autumn harvest struggle.
[Jizhong Electric] In order to specifically implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on land reform and party rectification work in 1948, the Jizhong District Party Committee specifically instructed the entire district that in September and October, whether land has been distributed or not, and in border areas, full effort must be made for autumn harvest and wheat planting. It pointed out that this year, more than 1,600 villages in Jizhong suffered severe floods, and 3,470 villages suffered insect plagues. Under these circumstances, the current autumn harvest and wheat planting has become the central task of reducing disasters, laying the foundation for next year's production, and supporting the war. The central issue of autumn harvest and wheat planting is the organization of people, animal power, and agricultural implements. Party committees at all levels should organize the masses to actively participate in production, and pay attention to mobilizing women to participate in autumn harvest and wheat planting. On the basis of the masses' existing production, small temporary mutual aid labor exchange groups should be organized under the principles of voluntariness and equivalence. At the same time, organs and troops must actively help the masses in the villages with autumn harvest and wheat planting. All economic departments must serve this work and solve the difficulties of the masses. In addition, different work priorities should be put forward according to different regions: in areas where land reform has been implemented, disaster areas should focus on production for disaster relief. Where there is no autumn harvest but wheat can be planted, the masses should be vigorously organized for production and disaster relief; in areas where there is no autumn harvest and wheat can be planted, all levels of the people should first be led to carry out a crash planting of wheat, and then the masses should be organized for sideline production. In wheat planting, every effort should be made to organize manpower, draught animals, and agricultural implements to solve the problem of wheat seeds and fertilizer. In areas where there is no disaster or the disaster is mild, and there is both an autumn harvest and wheat can be planted, the main thing is to first organize the masses to deliver manure and harvest the autumn crops, striving to plant as much land as possible that can be planted, and whoever plants the autumn seedlings will harvest them. In areas where land reform has not been implemented, the masses should be vigorously led in the autumn harvest and wheat planting. However, because the land has not been distributed, the masses are worried about planting wheat. It must be announced that whoever plants it will harvest it and whoever will bear the burden, and the land will be handed over after the wheat harvest next year (the same method will be used for land not distributed in areas where land reform has already been carried out). In the border areas, the armed forces must actively operate to protect the autumn harvest and wheat planting; strive to unite the broad masses to fight the enemy together. Strengthen militia work, implement joint defense for autumn protection, and combine labor and military to rush harvest and plant. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting, obstacles existing in different villages, such as the land being divided in a disorderly manner in some villages, the village-level organization being chaotic and unable to work, or the military family substitute farming being chaotic, should be appropriately adjusted and resolved without delaying the autumn harvest and wheat planting. In order to improve the production enthusiasm of people of all strata and break the concerns of the masses, it should be publicized that there will be no more equal division in areas where land reform has already been carried out (i.e., land has been fairly distributed or land has been basically equally divided). If some village cadres have inappropriate allocations and poor and hired farmers still lack land, and the land they lack is about 10% of the average number per person in the whole village, it will no longer be redistributed. And widely publicize the New China News Agency's editorial "Take the agricultural production of the liberated areas one step further" and the spirit of the North China People's Representative Conference's agricultural burden method. Regarding the issue of organization and leadership, party committees at all levels should conduct detailed discussions in accordance with the above spirit, and organize forces to deploy them to the villages before September 10. When cadres at all levels lead the masses in production, they should do so without delaying the masses' production and try to hold as few meetings as possible. Party committees at all levels must attach importance to production leadership and use key leadership methods to promote the general.

　　太行五地委召开边地会议
  　总结护麦布置保秋
  　冀中区党委指示全力秋收种麦
    【太行电】为了争取在保秋斗争中的更大胜利，中共太行五地委于八月十四日召开边地会议。到会有八个边沿县的县区村干部，以县为单位分小组座谈，首先经过自下而上的总结保麦斗争，提出开展保秋斗争中必须注意的三个问题：第一、边缘地区发动群众必须以贯彻由土改转向组织发动群众生产，和组织扩大反蒋统一战线的边地对敌斗争的新方针。第二、必须开展群众性的游击战争，明确认识边地斗争必须依靠群众和在不同地区下的游击战争的斗争方式和组织形式。第三、开展敌占区群众性的对敌斗争，以大量的发展群众武装和放手进行争取瓦解匪伪人员为主。经过五天的小组讨论研究和大会典型发言，从三个问题上具体的总结了保麦中的群众性的联防斗争、消灭无人区、以生产为基础开展对敌斗争及争取会门武装、瓦解敌军隐蔽工作等五种经验，同时也讨论了我们存在着的极大弱点，并具体布置了保秋斗争。
    【冀中电】冀中区党委为具体执行中共中央关于一九四八年土改工作与整党工作指示，特指示全区在九、十月份中，不论已经分地或未分地及边缘区，均须全力进行秋收种麦工作。指出：今年冀中一千六百余村遭受严重水灾，三千四百七十村遭虫灾。在此情况下，当前秋收种麦已成为减缩灾荒，打下明年生产基础，支援战争的中心任务。而秋收种麦的中心问题是人、畜力、农具的组织，各地党委应组织群众积极参加生产，并注意发动广大妇女参加秋收种麦。在群众旧有生产基础上，在自愿与等价原则下，组织小型的临时互助换工组。同时机关部队必须积极帮助驻村群众秋收种麦。各经济部门必须为此工作服务，解决群众困难。另外应根据各地不同地区提出各种不同工作重点：在已实行土改的地区，灾区应以生产救灾为中心。无秋收又不能种麦的，应大力组织群众生产救灾；无秋收能种麦的地区，应首先领导各阶层人民突击种麦，再组织群众副业生产。种麦中要尽一切可能组织人力、耕畜、农具，解决麦种及肥料问题。无灾或灾轻又有秋收又能种麦的地区，主要是先组织群众送粪秋收，争取能种麦的地收一块种一块，秋苗谁种谁收。在未实行土改地区，应大力领导群众，秋收种麦。但因土地未分，群众对种麦有顾虑，必须宣布谁种谁收、谁负担，待明年麦收后再移交土地（已土改过的地区未分出的土地种麦亦用此法）。在边缘区，武装要积极活动，保卫秋收种麦；争取团结广大群众共同对敌斗争。并加强民兵工作，实行联防护秋，劳武结合抢收抢种。在秋收种麦期间，对不同村庄存在的障碍，如有的村土地分乱了，有的村级组织混乱无法工作，或军属代耕混乱等，在不误秋收种麦原则下，应适当调整和解决。为了提高各阶层人民生产积极性，打破群众顾虑，应宣传凡已土改地区不再平分（即指土地已经公平分配或土地已经基本上平分了的），如有的村干因分配不恰当，贫雇农还缺少土地，其所缺土地在全村每人平均数百分之十左右者，即不再重分。并根据新华社“把解放区农业生产提高一步”社论和华北人民代表会议关于农业负担办法的精神广泛宣传。关于组织领导问题，各级党委应根据上述精神，进行详细讨论，并组织力量，于九月十日前布置到村。各级干部在领导群众生产时，要作到不误群众生产，尽量少开会。各级党委必须重视生产领导，并运用重点领导方法推动一般。
