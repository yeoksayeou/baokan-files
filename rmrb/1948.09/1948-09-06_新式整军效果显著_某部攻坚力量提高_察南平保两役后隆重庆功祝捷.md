　　Remarkable Results Achieved in New-Style Military Consolidation
  　Attacking Power of a Certain Unit Enhanced
  　Grand Celebration and Victory Meeting Held After the Pingbao Campaigns in Southern Chahar
    [Pingbao Frontline News] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army solemnly held a celebration and victory meeting. In the Party consolidation and military consolidation before the Pingbao campaigns in southern Chahar, this unit strictly reviewed the phenomena of lax discipline in individual units, insufficient determination in carrying out orders, and even delays in military opportunities. Therefore, during the advance into southern Chahar, senior leaders of the brigade and regiment went deep into the companies, sharing joys and hardships with the commanders and fighters. During the five-day march, there were very few desertions, creating a new record for the unit's consolidation. After the launch of the campaign, they received the order for the siege of a certain city, crossed the Sanggan River in a 140-li rapid march, and surrounded the enemy who attempted to escape. Comrade Du Fuqing, the battalion commander of a certain battalion, used binoculars to count the bricks on the city wall, accurately calculating the height. After the attack was launched, the unit quickly ascended the city wall, and all one thousand defending enemies were annihilated. In the Pingbao campaign, the unit received an emergency order to launch a 120-li rapid march to encircle a certain city where bandits attempted to flee, and in coordination with friendly forces, ascended the city in seven minutes, annihilating all the defending enemies. In the two siege battles, all the defending enemies were annihilated, two cities were liberated, and the combat mission was successfully completed. In the siege, 2,241 people were recognized as people's heroes. To celebrate this glorious achievement, the unit held a military celebration and victory meeting in a certain place a few days ago. In addition to summarizing the successful experience, it also proposed: "Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the leaders of the corps, resolutely implement orders, learn the skills of siege warfare, continue our efforts, and strive for thousands of heroes; call on all commanders and fighters to learn from the heroes, overcome all difficulties, resolutely complete the tasks, and strive for greater victories." All the commanders and fighters were extremely excited. After the meeting, Wang Yuqi, a major hero, said: "From now on, if I have ten points of strength, I must not use only nine points. I must use unparalleled determination to respond to the call of the higher authorities, strive for the entire platoon to achieve meritorious service, and repay the people." The third company of a certain unit, which did not undertake the main attack last time, is now intensifying its martial arts training, preparing to take on the most arduous combat tasks.

  　察南平保两役后隆重庆功祝捷
    【平保前线讯】解放军某部隆重举行庆功祝捷大会。该部在察南平保两役前的整党整军中，严格检讨了个别部队纪律不严，执行命令不够坚决，甚至耽误军机的现象，因此该部在察南进军中，旅团高级首长，深入连队，与指战员同甘苦共患难，行军五天，部队无甚逃亡，创造了该部巩固部队的新纪录。战役发起后，他们领取了某城攻坚战的命令，以一百四十里急行军渡过桑干河，包围企图逃跑之敌；某营营长杜甫卿同志用望远镜数城墙上的砖，精确计算高度。攻击发起后，该部迅速登城，守敌千人悉数被歼。平保战役中，该部接到紧急命令，以一百二十里急行军奔袭包围某城企图逃窜之匪，配合友军，七分钟登城，将守敌全歼，两次攻坚战斗，均全歼守敌，解放两城，圆满完成战斗任务。攻坚中涌现出人民功臣两千二百四十一名。为庆祝这种光荣战绩，该部特于日前在某地开军人祝捷庆功大会，除总结这次成功的经验外，并提出：“在党中央及兵团首长领导下，坚决执行命令，学好攻坚本事，再接再厉，争取千万功臣；号召全体指战员，向功臣看齐，克服一切困难，坚决完成任务，争取更大胜利”。全体指战员情绪极为激昂，会后，大功臣王玉岐表示：“今后咱有十分力量，不能使九分，一定要用无比的决心，响应上级的号召，争取全排立功，报答人民”。上次没有担任主攻的某部三连，现正加紧习武，准备担当最艰巨的战斗任务。（李洁臣）
