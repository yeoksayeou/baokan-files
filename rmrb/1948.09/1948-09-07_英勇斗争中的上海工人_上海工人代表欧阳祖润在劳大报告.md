　　The Heroic Struggle of Shanghai Workers
  　Shanghai Worker Representative Ouyang Zurun's Report at the Labor University

    For more than two years, the workers of Shanghai have waged a heroic struggle against the Kuomintang reactionary authorities, and in the struggle, they have further enhanced their political consciousness, expanded their ranks, and become an important force in the Chinese people's liberation struggle. Their epic struggle was reported in detail and vividly by Ouyang Zurun, a representative of Shanghai workers, at the Sixth National Labor Congress, arousing great concern and respect from the worker representatives of the liberated areas for their worker brothers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The following is an excerpt of the report:

    Since Japan's surrender in 1945, the anti-Chiang and anti-American struggle of Shanghai workers can be divided into three stages.
  　The first stage: from the factory protection and resumption of work movement after August 15th to the anti-civil war and demand for peace struggle climax on June 23, 1946.

    From the first day of the Japanese surrender, Shanghai workers launched the struggle to protect factories and eliminate traitors. Led by the machine workers and cotton mill workers in the Hudong and Huxi industrial areas, a struggle was launched against the traitors and running dogs. The struggle continued for three or four months, and the workers received relief funds, severance pay, victory bonuses, and supplies such as rice, cloth, and oil. They also organized armed pickets, seized guns from the Japanese army, and guarded factories and warehouses day and night, preserving a large amount of raw materials and protecting cotton mills (Shanghai has more than 2 million spindles, accounting for half of the country), machine factories, and shipyards. Workers in the Hudong district also organized a joint picket headquarters of 18 major factories, checking and patrolling at important intersections and passages, preventing the enemy and puppets from smuggling goods. At that time, the Shanghai workers were preparing to welcome the New Fourth Army to liberate Shanghai. However, in order to strive for peace and democracy, the New Fourth Army did not occupy Shanghai and reluctantly withdrew to northern Jiangsu. However, the Kuomintang's "takeover" officials flew in from the sky and crawled out from the ground to "take over" the factories and warehouses. The Shanghai workers handed over the factories they had protected, only making one request - "Start work immediately." But the "takeover" officials seized the factories and warehouses, putting up seals on the front door during the day and secretly transporting materials and machines away by truck from the back door at night. Some even set fire to eliminate traces, such as the sale of military supplies from the Japanese military headquarters on North Sichuan Road, and the strange fires in Maochang Cold Storage and Huangpu Warehouse, which were well-known major cases of takeover corruption in Shanghai. Large enterprises and factories were seized by Kuomintang bureaucrat-capital, organizing so-called China Textile, China Silk, and Wool Textile companies, implementing comprehensive control; the remaining dilapidated old factories were sold to national capitalists at a discount. These officials were busy with the takeover and not only did not talk about starting work, but also slandered the workers who demanded work as "puppet workers." As a result, the remaining illusions of some workers about the Kuomintang were shattered. The workers further organized and carried out the first demonstration and march after the victory, shouting slogans such as "Corrupt officials get rich, workers suffer," and "Victory in the War of Resistance, factories close down." As a result, the workers successfully fought for the resumption of work at the end of the year.

    Although the struggle to resume work was victorious, the lives of the workers were still not guaranteed. For example, the price of rice had increased 400,000 times compared to before the war, while wages had only increased 100,000 times. Therefore, a general strike struggle was launched in various industries and factories throughout Shanghai to increase the base salary, calculate wages according to the cost of living index, and demand freedom to organize trade unions, year-end bonuses, and welfare benefits. From the day of victory until April of the following year, there was the joint general strike of more than 100,000 workers in more than a dozen public and private cotton mills in the city, which forced the capitalists to accept the workers' 18 conditions. First, in Chiang Kai-shek's state-owned enterprises, there were strikes by the Jianghai Customs, the Four Banks employees, and Longhua Airport, strikes by telecommunications employees, a broom parade by more than 3,000 sanitation workers of the Health Bureau, a dung cart parade by night soil collectors, and the collective resignation of all civil servants of the municipal government. Secondly, there were strikes by French-owned water and electricity workers, British-owned water and electricity workers, gas workers, and American-owned electricity workers, followed by the involvement of machinery, printing, wool textiles, the six major department stores, hardware, and other industries. Even the bathhouse industry, barbershop industry, hotel industry, and shoemaker industry, which were more deeply controlled by feudal gangs, also participated. These strikes, whether for a few hours, a few days, or a few months, although suppressed, mostly achieved victory. This was an unprecedented wave of strikes since the Japanese surrender. Only the strike of the Central Printing Factory was suppressed by the Kuomintang reactionaries with military and police blockades, and more than 100 employees were dismissed and arrested.

    In addition to the struggle for livelihood, the Shanghai workers also launched a movement to expose traitors and demand democracy. For example, the employees of Xinxin Company exposed the company's manager, Li Ze, who had colluded with the Japanese invaders to loot cotton and iron materials and had served as a puppet business unification director. The employees of Kangyuan Cotton Mill exposed Xiang Kangyuan, the manager of the factory and a puppet advisory committee member. These actions exposed the Kuomintang reactionary group's traitorous crime of sheltering traitors. In April 1946, female workers in Shanghai cotton mills held a public opinion poll to oppose the Kuomintang's "National Assembly representatives" fixed ten years ago, and elected their own female National Assembly representatives, preparing to participate in the National Assembly under the Political Consultative Conference line. Comrade Tang Guifen of the Shanghai delegation attending this conference was honorably elected. On May Day, Shanghai workers held a parade and celebration meeting with nearly 100,000 people from more than 200 units, and successively held memorial services for the "April 8th" martyrs and Yu Zai, the Kunming "December 1st" democratic martyr.

    Through continuous struggle, the Shanghai workers organized a strong force of their own, established democratic trade unions representing the interests of the workers and leading the workers' struggle, and trained many outstanding worker leaders, all of whom were deeply supported by the vast number of workers.

    In early June 1946, the Shanghai working class, students, democratic人士, and national capitalists organized a united front against civil war and demanding peace. On June 23, nearly 100,000 workers from various industries in the city participated in a demonstration and march against the civil war, gathering at the North Railway Station to welcome the petition delegation to Nanjing, demanding that Chiang Kai-shek stop the civil war and implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Although the Kuomintang military, police, secret agents, and special agents were dispatched to sabotage, they were deterred by the huge momentum of the masses and did not dare to act. The railway workers more bravely refused the station master's order not to start the train and automatically drove the train out of the North Railway Station to Nanjing.

    In the first stage of the struggle, the Shanghai workers organized their own forces, improved their living conditions, demonstrated the power of the workers, increased their confidence in the struggle, recognized the true colors of the Kuomintang reactionary group and American imperialism, and began to move from an economic-based struggle to a clear anti-Chiang and anti-American struggle.

　　The second stage: from the "June 23rd" Grand Parade to the major strike of municipal enterprise workers in September 1947.

    During this period, the struggle of the workers became more clearly and resolutely a political struggle against American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary group. The struggle greatly educated the Shanghai workers and people, further strengthened the worker ranks, and enriched the struggle experience. The Kuomintang reactionary group, which was suffering successive military defeats, also changed its approach to the worker movement from secret sabotage to open arrests and massacres.

    In July 1946, workers in more than 200 silk factories in Shanghai launched a two-month strike. This was the longest strike since the victory of the War of Resistance. As a result, the strike was victorious, and the workers won the right to calculate wages based on the cost of living index.

    In February 1947, the Shanghai three-district department store guild, led by Yong'an, Xinxin, and other six major companies, launched a movement to love Chinese goods and resist American goods in order to oppose the dumping of American goods and save the crisis of national industry and commerce. On February 9, an enlarged meeting was held, attended by more than 400 employee representatives and industry and commerce representatives. Guo Moruo, Deng Chumin, Ma Yinchu, and other democratic figures also gave speeches at the meeting. The Kuomintang authorities actually sent more than 500 thugs to rush into the venue, beating anyone they saw and destroying anything they could find. More than 20 department store employees were seriously injured, and Liang Renda, an employee of Yong'an Company, died of his injuries that afternoon. The next day, the department store guild launched a counterattack against the reactionary rulers, established the Liang Renda Funeral Committee, and social figures and workers from all walks of life in Shanghai also organized the Liang Renda Martyr Tragedy Support Association. Seeing the growing strength of the workers, the Kuomintang reactionaries hastily tried to buy off Liang Renda's family with 100 million yuan, which was severely rejected, and had to agree to punish the murderers.

    At this time, the Kuomintang reactionary group implemented the so-called "economic emergency measures," freezing the cost of living index at the December 1946 level, so the lives of the workers were not guaranteed and continued to deteriorate. On May 1, Kuomintang Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Shanghai Kuomintang Chairman Fang Zhi, and others usurped this great festival, forced workers to participate in the memorial meeting, and stipulated anti-communist slogans, attempting to organize an anti-communist demonstration. However, the workers shouted the slogans "Unfreeze the cost of living index" and "Oppose freezing the cost of living index" at the meeting. These slogans expressed the most pressing demands of the broad masses of workers in Shanghai. Then, demonstrations by machine, silk weaving workers, American electricity, French electricity, and cotton spinning workers broke out successively to protest against the freezing of the cost of living index. When the French electricity workers petitioned the Shanghai Kuomintang Social Affairs Bureau, they happened to meet the petition procession of middle school students from the city opposing the scientific "unified examination." The two teams merged and shouted each other's slogans. As a result, both sides won victory.

    After that, the Shanghai workers' struggle turned to enterprises operated by imperialism and enterprises of the Kuomintang municipal government, and successively carried out struggles demanding occupational security, opposing arrests, and guaranteeing human rights. In September, the Kuomintang reactionary group attempted to draft workers in Shanghai factories and levy "wage income tax" on workers, which aroused the resistance of the six major municipal enterprises, won the sympathy and support of the broad masses of citizens, and achieved victory.

    On September 22, all 2,000-plus electricity workers gathered at the Social Affairs Bureau to protest the arrest of six editors of the "Electricity Worker Monthly" by Kuomintang special agents. Kuomintang special agent heads Zheng Jiemin, Wu Guozhen, Xuan Tiewu, etc., then planned a large-scale persecution of Shanghai workers. That night, they arrested electricity trade union representatives and activists on a large scale. On the 25th, the Kuomintang Social Affairs Bureau openly disbanded the electricity trade union and announced a list of trade union leaders wanted. Then, they sealed up the three-district department store trade union and arrested dozens of people. However, the workers' resistance struggle became even more resolute and heroic. On the 27th, French electricity workers went on strike to resist handing over a list of trade union activists, persisting for a week. Kuomintang military police and labor scabs entered the factory, attempting to sabotage the strike, but were resolutely resisted by the workers' picket team and workers. At that time, 96 workers were arrested, but the strike still persisted. The Kuomintang Social Affairs Bureau then ordered the disbandment of the French electricity trade union. At this time, the entire Shanghai was shrouded in the terror of the Kuomintang military, police, secret agents, and special agents. However, the workers' heroic struggle continued one after another. In late October, more than 200 leaders of the Shanghai Democratic Trade Union jointly issued a protest against the persecution by the Kuomintang reactionary group. At the same time, many trade union leaders of the editorial staff had to temporarily part with the workers. When these trade union leaders who were forced to leave said goodbye to the workers, the workers said with excitement: "You go! When the People's Liberation Army arrives, we can meet again!"

    Third stage: Unyielding resistance against the enemy's open arrests and massacres.

    Following the September general strike, no matter how openly the Kuomintang rulers terrorized and suppressed, a strike broke out at the Dalu Iron Factory in October, successfully hitting the conspiracy of capitalists colluding with bureaucratic capital to transfer machinery to Guangdong (the reactionary rulers attempted to establish their last base in South China). The Shanghai puppet General Labor Union wanted workers to donate money to build a meeting place. Secret agent head Lu Jingshi had previously feasted the trade union representatives, trying to win them over. On November 12, the puppet General Labor Union convened a meeting of trade union representatives, but everyone still rejected the proposal to donate money. The representatives said in unison: "We represent the interests of the workers and cannot sell out the workers, otherwise we will be beaten." After saying that, they dispersed in a huff. Lu Jingshi was caught between laughter and tears, flew into a rage, and ordered the factory owners to deduct workers' wages as a construction fee for the puppet General Labor Union. Some factories run by imperialism and bureaucratic capital carried out his order, but the workers immediately went on strike to protest, and the capitalists had to reissue the full amount. Until now, the puppet General Labor Union still has to live in its original dilapidated temple.

    This year, January, there was also a struggle by more than 10,000 dance hall employees against the Kuomintang Social Affairs Bureau's closure of dance halls, threatening and extorting huge sums of money.

    Soon after, the heroic and outstanding struggle of the workers of Shenxin No. 9 Factory resisting the massacre by the military police took place. Shenxin No. 9 Factory is the largest cotton mill in Shanghai, with more than 7,500 employees, four-fifths of whom are female workers. On January 28 (Lunar New Year's Eve), the factory employees went on strike to protest the capitalists' deduction of rationed rice, deduction of income tax, and the factory's unreasonable oppression of workers. The more than 7,000 workers were very well organized, with picket teams maintaining order, and song and drama teams conducting education and entertainment activities. On the morning of the 2nd, more than 5,000 plainclothes police officers, special agents, and armed forces of the Garrison Command, tanks, machine guns, American-style carbines, tear gas, and cavalry surrounded the factory on all sides. Secret agent heads Lu Jingshi, Xuan Tiewu, etc., said to the striking masses from armored vehicles: "Don't be exploited by the Communist Party, go home and celebrate the New Year." The workers unanimously replied: "We want to live, no matter what party, whoever seeks welfare for the workers, we will support them!" Seeing that threats and deception could not shake the workers' determination, these secret agent heads ordered a charge to be sounded at 5:30 p.m., directing the military police to attack the workers. Armored vehicles first rushed open the factory gate, and machine guns swept at the unarmed workers, and tear gas was released. The blood of the workers was boiling. One worker immediately jumped onto the factory's large truck, accelerated and charged at the armored vehicle, finally冲出ing the armored vehicle out of the factory. For a time, thousands of workers also used iron rods, stones, and machine parts, desperately throwing them at the military police. The female workers on the roof used water hoses to spray downwards, and threw anything they could lift downwards. Batches of workers fell down, and batches of them rushed up again. But the workers' flesh and blood could not withstand machine guns, tanks, and tear gas. Finally, the military police rushed into the factory. The cruel massacre lasted for two hours, killing and wounding more than 100 workers, arresting more than 200 people, and dismissing more than 1,000 workers. Currently, there are still 38 people imprisoned. A female worker picket captain, after being arrested, was severely tortured, asked to confess the list of strike leaders and picket teams, but she never said a word. The beasts pulled out her fingernails, but she only shouted; "Workers, remember this tragedy!"

    Afterwards, the Kuomintang reactionary group blocked the news, saying that only three people were killed or injured. But they couldn't stop the mouths of 7,000 workers. This unprecedented tragedy immediately spread throughout Shanghai, spread throughout the country, and shocked the world's workers!

    Workers and students from all industries in Shanghai indignantly organized donations to provide support, and stipulated that at 2:22 p.m. on February 22, all Shanghai workers and students would wear black紗 two inches and two points wide to commemorate the "February 22" tragedy. At the same time, the "Shen Jiu Incident Support Association" was organized to prepare for a memorial service for the fallen martyrs. The Kuomintang reactionary group not only strictly prohibited people from wearing black紗, but also conspired to sabotage the memorial service, arresting more than 200 worker leaders from various industries on the eve of the memorial service. The arrest terror action continued for a week.

    No matter how the Kuomintang reactionary group massacred and suppressed, the workers not only did not fear and retreat in the slightest, but instead adopted various more ingenious ways of struggle. This year, in April, the workers of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway carried out a "silent work" struggle. The workers lay on the rails without saying a word. When the Kuomintang authorities sent people to interfere, no one uttered a sound. They used this clever way to protect the worker leaders and achieved the victory of increasing wages.

    ★　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★

    The Shanghai workers have never succumbed under heavy oppression, and they have never been negative and disappointed. On the contrary, their ranks are stronger and more powerful. They have already paid the price, and they firmly believe that the blood of the martyrs has not been shed in vain. They all know that the day when the People's Liberation Army will liberate them is not far away.

　　英勇斗争中的上海工人
  　上海工人代表欧阳祖润在劳大报告
    上海的工人两年多来向国民党反动当局进行了英勇的斗争，并且在斗争中更提高了自己的政治觉悟，扩大了自己的队伍，成为中国人民解放斗争中的一个重要力量。他们的可歌可泣的斗争事迹，在第六次全国劳动大会上，由上海工人代表欧阳祖润作了详尽而生动的报告，引起了解放区工人代表对国民党统治区工人兄弟的极大关怀与崇敬。兹将这一报告内容摘志如下：
    从一九四五年日本投降以来，上海职工的反蒋反美斗争可以分为三个阶段。
  　第一阶段：从“八一五”后的护厂复工运动到一九四六年六月二十三日反内战要和平的斗争高潮。
    从日寇投降头一天起，上海职工便开展了护厂、肃奸斗争。以沪东沪西两工业区的机器工人、纱厂工人为首，发动了对汉奸、走狗的斗争。斗争继续了三四个月，工人得到了救济金、解散费、胜利金及米布油等物资，并组织了武装纠察队，夺取日军的枪支，日夜看守工厂仓库，保存了大宗原料，保护了纱厂（上海的纱锭有二百多万，占全国半数）、机器厂、造船厂等。沪东区工人并组织了十八个大厂的联合纠察队指挥部，在重要路口孔道检查巡逻，防止了敌伪的偷运。当时上海工人是准备迎接解放上海的新四军的。但为了争取和平民主，新四军没有进占上海，忍痛向苏北撤退。而国民党的“劫收”大员却从天上飞来，从地下钻出来把工厂仓库“劫收”了。上海工人把自己保护下来的工厂交给他们，只提出一个要求——“立刻开工”。但是“劫收”大员将工厂仓库抢到手，白天在前门贴封条，夜晚便从后门把物资机器用卡车偷运走，有的甚至放一把火消灭痕迹，如北四川路的日军司令部军用物资的变卖，如茂昌冷藏库、黄浦仓库的怪火，便是上海人民周知的劫收贪污大罪案。大的企业工厂则都被国民党官僚资本所劫收，组织所谓中纺、中蚕、毛纺等公司，实行全面统制；剩下一些破烂不堪的旧厂，才折价卖给民族资本家。这些大员忙于劫收，不但不谈开工，反污蔑要求开工的工人是“伪工人”，于是部分工人中对国民党残存的幻想，也都破灭了。工人们进一步组织起来，进行了胜利后第一次的示威游行，高呼“贪官发财，工人遭殃”，“抗战胜利，工厂关门”等口号。结果，工人胜利地争取了在年底复工。
    复工斗争虽然胜利了，但工人生活仍没有保障。如米价比战前涨了四十万倍，而工资才增十万倍。因而全沪各业各厂普遍展开了增加底薪、按生活指数计算工资，要求组织工会自由、年赏、福利等的罢工斗争。从胜利日始截至第二年四月止，先后有十一月全市公私营纱厂十余万工人的联合大罢工，迫使资方接受了工人的十八个条件。首先，蒋匪国营企业中有江海关、四行职工、龙华飞机场的罢工，电讯职工的罢工，卫生局三千余清道夫的扫帚游行，粪夫的粪车游行，以及市府全体公务员的总辞职。其次则有法商水电工人、英商水电工人及煤气工人、美商电力工人等的罢工，继之卷入的有机器、印刷、毛纺、六大百货公司、五金等行业，连封建帮会统治较深的浴室业、理发业、旅馆业、皮鞋匠等也都参加了。这些罢工，或数小时，或数天，或数月，虽遭到镇压，但大都取得了胜利。这是日本投降以来空前的一次罢工潮。仅有中央印刷厂的罢工，被国民党反动派用军警封锁镇压下去，开除并逮捕了一百余职工。
    除了生活斗争之外，上海职工又展开检举汉奸以及要求民主的运动。如新新公司职工检举曾勾结日寇搜刮棉铁物资并曾任伪商统一理事的该公司经理李泽，康元制纱厂职工检举该厂经理伪咨询委员项康元等，暴露了国民党反动集团庇护汉奸的卖国罪行。一九四六年四月上海纱厂女工为反对国民党十年前固定的“国大代表”而举行了一次民意测验，选举自己的女国大代表，准备参加政协路线下的国大。此次参加大会的上海代表团汤桂芬同志，光荣当选。五一节，上海工人举行了包括二百多单位近十万人的游行庆祝大会，并先后举行了纪念“四八”烈士和昆明“一二、一”民主烈士于再的追悼大会。
    从不断的斗争中，上海职工自己组织起了强大的队伍，建立了代表工人利益领导工人斗争的民主工会，锻炼出许多优秀的职工领袖。都深得广大工人的拥护。
    一九四六年六月初，上海工人阶级和学生与民主人士，民族资本家，组织了反内战要和平的统一战线。六月二十三日，全市各业将近十万工人参加了反内战的示威游行，集合在北站欢送请愿代表团赴南京，要求蒋介石停止内战，实行政协决议。国民党军、警、宪、特虽武装出动，准备破坏，终慑于群众浩大的声势，未敢动手。而铁路工人更英勇地拒绝站长不许开车的命令，自动将火车开出北站，驶往南京。
    在第一阶段的斗争中，上海的职工组织了自己的队伍，得到了生活的改善，表现了工人力量，提高了斗争信心，认清了国民党反动集团和美帝国主义的面目，开始从以经济为主的斗争走上明确的反蒋反美斗争的道路。
　　第二阶段：从“六二三”大游行到一九四七年九月的市政企业工人大罢工。
    工人在这一期间的斗争，更加具有明确和坚决的反对美帝国主义及国民党反动集团的政治斗争的性质。在斗争中大大教育了上海的职工和人民，进一步锻炼了职工队伍，更丰富了斗争经验。而在军事上节节失败的国民党反动集团对职工运动也从秘密破坏变为公开的逮捕和屠杀。
    一九四六年七月，上海二百多家丝厂工人掀起了两个月的罢工。这是抗战胜利后最长的一次罢工。结果获得胜利，工人争得了依生活指数计算工资。
    一九四七年二月，上海三区的百货业公会，以永安、新新等六大公司为首，为反对美货倾销，为挽救民族工商业危机，发起了爱用国货抵制美国运动。二月九日召开扩大会议，到会职工代表及工商代表四百余人；会上并有郭沫若、邓初民、马寅初等民主人士演讲。国民党当局竟派五百余打手冲进会场，逢人便打，见物就毁，二十余名百货业职工受重伤，永安公司职工梁仁达当天下午因伤重逝世。第二天，百货公会便展开了向反动统治者的反击，成立梁仁达治丧委员会，上海社会人士及各界职工也纷起组织梁仁达烈士惨案后援会。国民党反动派见职工声势壮大，一面手忙脚乱的想以一万万元收买梁仁达家属，遭到了严止的拒绝，一面不得不答应惩办凶手。
    这时，国民党反动集团实行了所谓“经济紧急措施”，把生活指数冻结在一九四六年十二月水平，职工生活因而毫无保障，愈趋恶化。五月一日，国民党上海市长吴国桢、社会部长谷正纲、上海国民党主委方治等，僭用这个伟大的节目，强迫工人参加纪念会，规定了反共口号，企图组织一个反共示威游行。但工人们即在这次大会上喊出了“解冻生活指数”“反对冻结生活指数”的口号。这些口号，喊出了上海广大劳动群众的最迫切要求。于是先后爆发了机器，丝织工人，美电、法电、棉纺等工人的抗议冻结生活指数的示威游行。当法电工友在上海国民党社会局请愿时，恰巧和全市中学生反对科学式的“会考”的请愿行列相遇。两个队伍就汇合在一起，互相喊出对方口号。结果双方都争取得了胜利。
    此后，上海职工斗争即转入帝国主义经营的企业和国民党市政府的企业，连续进行了要求职业保障、反对逮捕、保障人权等斗争。九月，国民党反动集团企图在上海工厂抽丁，并向工人抽“工资所得税”，当激起了六大市政企业的反抗斗争，取得广大市民的同情和拥护，获得了胜利。
    九月二十二日，电力职工全体二千余人，为抗议国民党特务逮捕“电工月报”的六位编辑，齐集社会局请愿。国民党特务头子郑介民、吴国桢、宣铁吾等乃布置了对上海工人的大规模迫害。是晚，即大肆逮捕电力工会代表和积极分子。二十五日，国民党社会局又明令解散电力工会，并公布通缉工会领袖名单。接着，查封了三区百货业工会，捕去数十人。但工人们的反抗斗争也更加坚决英勇。二十七日法电工人为反抗交出工会积极分子名单，举行罢工，坚持了一个星期。国民党军警和工贼进工厂，企图破坏罢工，遭到了工人纠察队及工人的坚决的抗拒。当时工人被捕去九十六人，但罢工仍坚持着。国民党社会局于是又下令解散法国工会。这时，全上海均在国民党军、警、宪、特的恐怖笼罩下。但工人的英勇斗争，仍此伏彼起。十月下旬，上海民主工会二百余领袖即联名发表了反对国民党反动集团迫害的抗议书，同时，许多编缉的工会领袖不得不暂时与工人们分别。当这些被迫出走的工会领袖与工友们话别时，工友们都激昂的说：“你们去吧！人民解放军到来的时候，我们又可以见面的！”
    第三阶段：不屈不挠对抗敌人的公开逮捕和屠杀。
    继九月大罢工后，不管国民党统治者怎样公开恐怖镇压，十月又爆发了大陆铁厂罢工，胜利的打击了资方与官僚资本勾结，将机器向广东转移的阴谋（反动统治者企图在华南建立他们最后的基地）。上海伪总工会为了建造会所，要工人捐款。特务头子陆京士事先曾大宴工会代表，想从中笼络收买。十一月十二日，伪总工会召集各工会代表开会，但大家依然否决了捐款的提议。代表们齐说：“我们代表工人利益，不能出卖工人，不然就要挨打。”说后一哄而散。陆京士哭笑不得，暴跳如雷，下令各厂资方扣除工人工资作为伪总工会建立费。有些帝国主义和官僚资本的厂方执行了他的命令，但工人马上罢工抗议，资方只得照数补发。直到现在，伪总工会还只得住在原来那所破庙里。
    今年一月，又发生了万余舞业职工反对国民党社会局封闭舞厅，威胁勒索巨款的斗争。
    此后不久，就发生了申新九厂工人英勇卓绝的抵抗军警屠杀的斗争。申新九厂是上海最大的纱厂，有职工七千五百余，其中五分之四都是女工。一月二十八日（阴历年夜），该厂职工为了反抗资方克扣配给米、扣所得税，反抗厂方无理压迫工人，举行了罢工。七千余工人组织得很严密，有纠察队维持秩序，有歌咏、话剧队等进行教育和文娱活动。二日上午，五千余名单警特务和警备司令部的武装部队、坦克车、机关枪、美式卡宾、催泪弹以及马队，就把工厂四面包围，特务头子陆京士、宣铁吾等在铁甲车上向罢工群众说：“你们别受共产党利用，快回家过年。”工人一致的回答是：“我们要生活，不管什么党，谁为工人谋福利，我们就拥护谁！”这些特务头子见威胁和欺骗都不能动摇工人的决心。至晚五时半，宣铁吾下令吹冲锋号，指挥军警向工人进攻。一辆辆装甲车先冲开了工厂大门，机枪向徒手工人齐扫，并施放了催泪弹。工人们的血都沸腾起来了。有一个工友立即跳上工厂的大卡车，开足马力向装甲车冲去，终于把装甲车冲出厂外。一时数千工人也都用铁棍、石头和机器零件，拼命向军警投掷；在屋顶上的女工们，用水龙向下冲，用一切拿得动的东西向下掷。工人一批批的倒下去，一批批地又冲上来。但工人的血肉当然抵不住机枪坦克和催泪弹。终于被军警冲进了工厂。残酷的屠杀进行了二小时，死伤工友一百余人，被捕的二百多人，被开除的工人一千余。现尚有三十八人被囚在牢里，一位女工纠察队长被捕后，受着严刑拷打，要她供出罢工领袖和纠察队名单，但她始终一字不吐；野兽们把她的手指甲都拔了出来，但她只叫喊着；“工友们要记住这场惨案！”
    事后国民党反动集团封锁新闻，说只死伤三人。但他们封不住七千工人的嘴，这空前的惨案马上传遍了上海，传遍了全国，并震动了世界的职工！
    上海各业工人以及学生，痛愤地组织了募捐支援，并规定于二月二十二日下午二时二十二分，全上海工友、学生佩带二寸二分宽的黑纱，纪念“二二”惨案。同时组织了“申九事件后援会”，准备为死难烈士开追悼会。国民党反动集团一面严禁人民戴黑纱；一面更阴谋破坏追悼会，在追悼会召开的前夜，逮捕了各业工人领袖二百余人。逮捕的恐怖行动继续一星期之久。
    不管国民党反动集团怎样屠杀和镇压，工人不但丝毫没有畏惧退缩，相反地采取了各种各样更巧妙的斗争方式。今年四月，京沪铁路工人进行了“哑工”斗争。工人齐卧铁轨上一言不发，国民党当局派人来干涉，没有一个人哼声。他们就利用这种巧妙的方式，保卫了工人领袖，取得了增加工资的胜利。

    上海职工，在重重压迫下面，始终没有屈服，始终没有消极失望，相反的，他们的队伍是更强大、更有力量了。他们已经付出了代价，并且深信先烈的血并没有白流，他们都知道人民解放军前去解放他们的日子已不还了。
