　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st—Electone News Agency, Calcutta, 15th: News arriving here reveals that British intelligence agencies are behind the Karen people's rebellion in Burma, who are fighting for the establishment of an autonomous Karen State independent of the Burmese government. Reliable sources say that British personnel have been in contact with key figures of the Karen National Union (whose forces control the entire Salween region in southeastern Burma), urging them to continue their struggle for autonomy and promising that the Karen State will be recognized by Britain. This confirmation of British intelligence activity in the Burmese conflict leads observers here to assume that Britain will also support the movements of other tribes further north seeking autonomy—especially the Daibu and Kachin tribes. The aim of British personnel is to encourage various ethnic or disguised "ethnic" autonomous movements within Burma, in order to spread chaos and dissatisfaction among the Burmese people, and to divide and weaken the Burmese people's liberation movement, whose forces are waging an independent struggle for freedom against the British puppet government in Rangoon. It is pointed out that Britain can safely support such autonomous movements of backward tribes, which can establish a small regional government under permanent British control. Several leaders of the Karen National Union—especially those educated in Britain—have indicated their willingness to play this role. By interfering through orchestrating these small "riots," Britain hopes to put the Burmese government in an embarrassing position and declare that the Burmese government is unable to maintain order within its own country. This will serve as a pretext to forcibly change the Burmese government (which is increasingly showing signs of instability in the face of the people's rebellion) and replace it with extreme right-wing political figures. Britain could then invite itself to send troops into Burma, using the same methods as in Malaya—using Spitfire fighter planes, the latest weapons, and barbaric "headhunters"—to suppress the liberation movement. This would be a complete exposure of the farcical "independence" treaty signed with the Burmese government this spring.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st—TASS, Moscow: Commenting on the situation in Burma, Izvestia wrote: The national liberation movement, which has been developing in Burma for many years, is now increasingly taking the form of guerrilla warfare against the British colonialists and their agents in Burma. The declaration of martial law throughout Burma on August 20 is merely one indication of the joint operations being prepared by the British colonialists and Burmese reactionaries against the Burmese people's national liberation movement. At the same time, this illustrates the magnitude of the Burmese people's struggle for national independence.

　　缅甸人民解放运动有增无已
  　英阴谋派军队入缅
    站在克伦族人幕后散布混乱制造借口
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】电通社加尔各答十五日讯：到达此间的消息显示，英国情报机关正站在缅甸的克伦族人暴动的幕后，而该族人正为争取成立不属于缅甸政府之自治的克伦邦而战。可靠消息称，英国人员已与克伦族联盟的首脑人物相接触（这些人物的军队正控制着缅甸东南部萨尔温区的全境），力促他们继续自治斗争，并提出此一诺言，即克伦邦将会获得英国的承认。由于缅甸内争中英国情报机关活动之这一证实，此间人士认为，还可以假定英国将要支持更北的其他部族争取自治的运动——特别是大部及卡钦族。英国人员的目的，在于鼓励缅甸境内各种民族的或伪装“民族”的自治运动，以便在缅甸人民中间散布混乱与不满，并希望借此分裂与削弱缅甸人民的解放运动，此种运动的军队，正在进行争取自由反对仰光英国傀儡政府的独立斗争。人们指出，英国能够安全地支持落后部族的这种自治运动，此种部族能成立一个在英国永久支配下的小地区政府。克伦民族同盟若干领袖——特别是曾在英国受过教育的——已表示他们情愿扮演这种角色。英国借其对于主持这种小“暴动”之干涉，正希望使缅甸政府处于难堪的地位，并宣布缅政府无力在其自己的国家内维持秩序。这将会成为强行改变缅甸政府（在人民暴动的面前，该政府已日益现出其动摇不稳的迹象）并使极端右翼的政界人物替代该政府之借口。英国就能使自己被邀派遣军队进入缅甸，用与在马来亚所采取的相同的办法——用喷火式战斗机，最新式武器及野蛮的“猎头颅专家”——以镇压解放运动。这将会是今年春季与缅甸政府签订之滑稽的“独立”条约的完全暴露。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报在评论缅甸情势时写道：已经在缅甸发展多年的民族解放运动，现在正在有增无减地采取游击战形式以反对英国殖民者及其在缅甸的代理人。八月二十日在缅甸全国颁布的戒严令，仅仅是英国殖民者及缅甸反动派准备中的反对缅甸人民民族解放运动的联合作战的迹象之一而已。同时，这说明了缅甸人民争取国家独立斗争规模的宏大。
