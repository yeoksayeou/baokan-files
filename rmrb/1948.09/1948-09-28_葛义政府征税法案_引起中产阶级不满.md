　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Paris dispatch: The tax law bill stipulated by the Gouin government, which increases the burden on the people, was passed in the French National Assembly on the 19th by a vote of 300 to 262. This bill stipulates an increase in taxes of 80 billion francs on various domestic industrial products such as tobacco, petroleum, and postage. It will increase the income tax rate for farmers, merchants, industrialists, and professionals by 30 percent, and the property tax by 20 percent. As a result of the tax increase, the prices of goods such as gasoline, bread, and tobacco will rise by more than 25 percent, subway and train fares will increase by 80 to 100 percent, and wine will increase by 50 percent. The Small Capital Merchants Association of southern France issued a statement before the bill was passed, saying that if the automobile tax is implemented, all trade will stagnate. The soaring prices caused by the sharp increase in freight (every car owner has to pay a monthly tax of 5,000 francs) will make it impossible for people to buy goods. The Paris Volunteer Army newspaper commented on the matter, saying: "The French people will never forgive the majority of the National Assembly that passed this bill, because the Gouin bill is a fatal blow to the working people."

　　葛义政府征税法案
    引起中产阶级不满
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】巴黎讯：葛义政府所规定的加重人民负担的征税法案已于十九日在法国国民议会中以三百票对二百六十二票通过。这一法案规定对各种本国工业产品烟草、石油及邮资等加税达八百亿法郎，将农民、商人、工业家和专业者的所得税税率增加百分之三十，财产税增加百分之二十。增税结果，将使汽油、面包、烟草等货物价格上涨百分之二十五以上，地下铁路和火车票价加价百分之八十到一百，酒涨价百分之五十。法国南部的小资本商人协会在该法案通过前发表谈话称：如实行对汽车增税将使一切贸易陷于停滞。因运费剧增（每辆汽车车主须付月税五千法郎）而造成物价高涨，将使人民无力购买物品。巴黎义勇军报于评论此事时说：“法国人决不会饶恕通过这一法案的国民议会的大多数。因为葛义法案是对劳动人民的致命打击。”（塔斯社）
