　　Jinnan Daily Editorial Calls for
  　Concrete and Specific Leadership in Wheat Planting
    [Jinnan Electric] The Jinnan Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Specifically Lead, Concretely Plan, and Complete the Wheat Planting Task." It began by stating: "The wheat planting season is approaching. Although all regions in the district have emphasized leadership in wheat planting, most lack specific plans for wheat planting, specific work, and in-depth inspection. This will inevitably cause the work to remain at the level of empty slogans." The editorial proposed: "The policy for wheat planting should be to strive to plant as much as possible. All reserved wheat land and early stubble land (good sorghum stubble) must be guaranteed to be planted in a timely manner, and late stubble should also be strived to be planted as early as possible. Some areas should also have planned organization of labor for reclaiming wasteland for wheat planting." All regions should put forward specific requirements according to the specific conditions of the local geology, such as the increase in yield per mu next year, the area and amount of wheat planting, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu, and the number of plowing and harrowing times before sowing, seed selection, etc. In addition to specific requirements, it is also necessary to further solve specific difficulties. In areas where the masses do not have the habit of accumulating fertilizer, it is estimated that the lack of fertilizer will be a major problem in wheat planting. It is necessary to call on the masses to accumulate and buy fertilizer. If it is really impossible to solve, it is necessary to plan for top dressing in the coming spring. In order to achieve more and earlier planting, it is necessary to solve the difficulties of manpower and animal power. On the one hand, do a good job in organization, and on the other hand, call on the masses to reduce unnecessary animal power consumption. Call on all agencies to lend their livestock to the masses during the wheat planting period. Call on women to participate in agricultural labor and organize manpower to pull plows and cultivators to solve the difficulties of human and animal power." The editorial finally pointed out: "All regions must effectively promote district and village organizations and provide specific assistance to districts and villages. County and district leading organs must also conduct in-depth inspection and supervision, and discover and solve problems at any time."
    [Jinnan Electric] More than a dozen counties including Baixiang, Guanxian, and Qinghe in Jinnan have successively issued instructions on wheat planting, calling on the masses to actively harvest autumn crops, deliver manure, turn the soil, organize mutual aid, and prepare for wheat planting. Many areas have already taken action. In order to solve the difficulty of animal power for the masses in wheat planting, the Second District of Yuanchao widely publicized the free lending of livestock, and the interest was determined by both parties. In addition, it educated village cadres and party members to consciously and voluntarily provide beneficial or non-beneficial loans to poor households, returned famine refugees, and elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households. The North Shenzhuang Farmers' Association in the Fourth District of Xin County called on the masses to plow, fertilize, and sun the land as they harvested, and plowed more than 190 mu of land in two days. Beixiabao in Guangping reclaimed 98 mu of wasteland in six days and collected more than 128,000 catties of thatch. The whole village is conducting a second plowing. In order to expand the wheat planting area, the Sixth District of Xiajin mobilized more than 1,000 civilians to dig ditches to divert water, so that the water could enter the Shahe River from Longwangkou. A command post was also established to provide work in exchange for relief. Linzhang County plans to strive to expand the wheat field by more than 80%. Qinghe County is preparing to expand more than double (last year was 1,000 hectares). In order to solve the difficulty of wheat seeds in the disaster area, Ningnan County's government lent out 120,000 catties of wheat seeds.

　　冀南日报社论号召
  　切实具体领导种麦
    【冀南电】冀南日报顷以“具体领导切实计划完成种麦任务”为题，发表社论。首称：种麦季节将到，全区各地虽然重视了领导种麦，但大都缺乏种麦的具体计划，缺乏具体工作及深入检查。这样必然使工作停留在空口号召上。社论提出：种麦的方针，应是尽量争取多种，全部留麦地和早茬地（好高粱茬）要保证及时种好，晚茬也要尽量争取多种早种，某些地区还应有计划组织劳力开荒种麦。各地应按照当地的地质等具体条件，提出具体要求，如明年每亩增产要求，种麦面积和数目，每亩施肥多少，以及播种前犁、耙等次数、选种等，除具体要求外，还须进一步解决其具体困难。在群众没有积肥习惯的地区，估计种麦中肥料缺乏是个大问题，必须号召群众积肥买肥，如实在解决不了，要计划明春追肥。为了达到多种、早种，必须解决人力和畜力困难，一方面很好的进行组织工作，一方面号召群众节少不必要的畜力消耗。号召各个机关在种麦期间把牲口借给群众。号召妇女参加农业劳动，组织人力拉犁拉耧，以解决人畜力之困难。社论最后指出：各地必须切实推动区村组织，对区村予以具体帮助。县区领导机关，还必须深入检查督促，随时发现与解决问题。
    【冀南电】冀南柏乡、冠县、清河等十几县相继发布种麦指示，号召群众积极收秋、送粪、翻土、组织互助、准备种麦后，不少地区已行动起来。元朝二区为解决群众种麦中畜力困难，广泛宣传自由出贷牲口，利息由双方自定。另外教育村干、党员自觉自愿的对贫户、逃荒归来户、老弱孤寡户做有利或无利借贷。莘县四区北沈庄农会号召群众随收随给随晒地，两天耠地一百九十余亩。广平北下堡六天开荒九十八亩，拾茅草十二万八千多斤。全村正在进行翻二遍地。夏津六区为扩大种麦面积，动员民力千余挖沟顺水，使水由龙王口入沙河。并成立了指挥部，以工代赈。临漳县计划争取扩大麦田百分之八十以上。清河县准备扩大一倍以上（去年为一千顷）。宁南县为解决灾区麦种困难，政府贷出麦种十二万斤。
