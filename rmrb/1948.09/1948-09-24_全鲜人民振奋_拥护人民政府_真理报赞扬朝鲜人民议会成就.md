    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] TASS reports: The success of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly meeting and the establishment of a unified government of the People's Democratic Republic have excited the Korean people and shocked the South Korean reactionaries and their American masters. In North Korea, mass rallies and demonstrations are being held everywhere to celebrate the establishment of a unified democratic government. According to preliminary statistics, as of the 15th, the number of people participating in mass rallies and demonstrations in Pyongyang exceeded 300,000, 120,000 in Hamhung, 118,000 in Sinuiju, 91,000 in Wonsan, 89,000 in Chongjin, 90,000 in Nanam, and 57,000 in Haeju. At the mass rally in Pyongyang, representatives from various political parties in North and South Korea, as well as representatives from workers, farmers, and intellectuals, delivered speeches, unanimously expressing their welcome and support for the unified democratic government. Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman of the Presidium of the Assembly Kim Tu-bong delivered speeches in reply. The meeting passed a resolution stating: "The central government, headed by the national hero Kim Il-sung, is a government of the true people. The program announced by the government is the struggle program of the entire people." In South Korea, the US military occupation authorities and the Seoul puppet government, frightened by the success of the Supreme People's Assembly elections, have been carrying out large-scale arrests of people from all walks of life who participated in the Korean Supreme People's Assembly elections since mid-August. According to South Korean puppet President Syngman Rhee, as of September 2nd, thousands of people had been arrested. According to other news agency reports, the flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has appeared several times in front of the heavily guarded puppet government building in Seoul and in other parts of the city. A special curfew was announced in Seoul on the 16th. Two democratic newspapers were sealed off.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] Moscow News: Pravda published an editorial on the 13th entitled "A Major Historical Event in the Life of the Korean People," pointing out that the achievements of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly "mean that the Korean people have taken an important step forward on the road to unification"; and "demonstrates the unanimous will of the Korean people to continue striving for the reunification of North and South Korea into a single, independent, and democratic Korean state." The editorial emphasized the Soviet Union's attitude, saying: "The Soviet Union has consistently and unswervingly defended the interests of the Korean people, fulfilled its obligations and demanded that the United States fulfill its obligations, and guaranteed the truly democratic development of Korea as a single, independent, and sovereign state." The editorial exposed that the reason why the United States repeatedly rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw troops from Korea simultaneously "is because the US policy aims to dismember Korea and turn South Korea into a colony of American monopoly capitalists." The editorial concluded: "The Soviet people welcome the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and regard it as an extremely important step towards the unification of the entire Korean people."

　　全鲜人民振奋
    拥护人民政府
  　真理报赞扬朝鲜人民议会成就
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社报导：朝鲜最高人民议会会议的成功与人民民主共和国统一政府的建立，振奋了朝鲜人民，震骇了南朝鲜反动派及其美国主子。在北朝鲜，各地普遍举行群众大会与示威，庆祝统一的民主政府的建立。据初步统计，截至十五日止，参加平壤群众大会与示威的人数有三十万以上，咸兴有十二万人，新义州有十一万八千人，元山有九万一千人，清津有八万九千人，罗南有九万人，海州有五万七千人。在平壤的群众大会上，南北朝鲜各政党代表以及工人、农民、知识分子的代表，均发表演说，一致表示欢迎与拥护统一的民主政府。总理金日成与议会主席团主席金＠凤曾致答词。大会通过决议称：“以民族英雄金日成为首的中央政府，是真正人民的政府。政府所宣布的纲领便是全体人民的斗争纲领。”在南朝鲜，为最高人民议会选举的成功所吓慌的美军占领当局与汉城傀儡政府，自八月中旬起，即对参加朝鲜最高人民议会选举的各阶层人士，实行大规模逮捕。据南朝鲜伪总统李承晚承认：至九月二日止，被捕者已达数千人。另据其他通讯社消息：朝鲜人民民主共和国国旗曾在汉城警卫森严的伪政府大厦之前及市内其他地方数度出现。十六日汉城已宣布特别戒严。两家民主报纸被查封。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】莫斯科讯：真理报于十三日发表题为“朝鲜人民生活中的重大历史事件”的社论，指出朝鲜最高人民议会的成就，“意味着朝鲜人民已沿着统一的道路迈进了重要的一大步”；并“表明了朝鲜人民要继续争取南北朝鲜重新结合为一单一独立民主朝鲜国的一致意志”。社论着重说明苏联的态度说：“苏联一贯地不屈不挠地维护朝鲜人民的利益，自己履行并要求美国履行所承担的义务，保证朝鲜作为单一的独立主权国之真正民主发展”。社论揭穿美国之所以一再拒绝苏联提出的同时自朝鲜撤兵的建议，“是因为美国政策是以肢解朝鲜与变南朝鲜为美国垄断资本家殖民地为其目标的”。社论结语称：“苏联人民欢迎朝鲜人民民主政府的成立，认为这是走向整个朝鲜人民统一的极其重要的步骤。”
