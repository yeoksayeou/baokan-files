　　Bravely Occupying Xifan Village
　　Geng Xi
　　1. "We are fighting a nail-in-the-ground battle."
　　"Comrades are brave and tenacious,
　　We are fighting a 'nail-in-the-ground battle';
　　Wherever we fight,
　　We stick like a nail."
　　Currently, this slogan is very popular in our army. No matter where we fight, enemies several times our size cannot move us; if they do not surrender, they can only be annihilated. On July 12th, after we captured Dachang Town and annihilated the Provisional 34th Army, the Zhao Chengzhou group, which had long been heavily besieged, had only two divisions left, compressed into the small villages of Xifan and Xiaochang. Zhao Chengzhou even stuffed his headquarters and the 33rd Army headquarters into Xifan Village, which had less than fifty households, and stubbornly waited for reinforcements. This was obviously a posture of being beaten, a posture of preparing to be annihilated. This was a fierce battle, and this battle determined Zhao Chengzhou's fate as a prisoner.
　　On the morning of the 14th, after a fierce artillery bombardment, Wang Siniu, the deputy platoon leader of the 2nd Platoon of a certain company, led his assault group to the enemy's front line. But when he looked back, there were only seven or eight people left. It turned out that the enemy had learned a lesson from the annihilation at Dachang Town and, fearing the killing power of our fierce artillery fire, used the three water channels outside the village to construct fortifications, linking and surrounding Xifan and Xiaochang villages. They deployed their light and heavy weapons and main forces there. When our powerful artillery fire fiercely bombarded, they hid in the bomb shelters built using the water channels, making it difficult to detect them. When Wang Siniu rushed to within a dozen meters of the enemy, the smoke raised by our artillery fire disappeared, and a row of black machine guns appeared in front of Wang Siniu, suddenly spewing out several rows of bullets. So he discovered the reason why only seven or eight of them could rush up. This was an open area several hundred meters wide, and it was dangerous to show one's head even slightly. They clung to the cornfield, which was only a foot high, and used shovels to push the soil in front of their heads, trying to use it to temporarily cover themselves, preparing to attack immediately.
　　After a burst of small artillery fire and rifle grenades, the enemy, wearing steel helmets and wielding bayonets, rushed over. A volley of grenades drove the enemy back, but the enemy's bullets also pierced through the soil that temporarily sheltered them. One comrade sacrificed himself, and another was wounded.
　　After repeatedly defeating the enemy's two counterattacks, only five people were left: Wang Siniu, Yang Cheng, Song Caishun, Li Tiancheng, and Liang Youxing. Only thirteen grenades and ten bullets were left. The soldiers became afraid and whispered:
　　"Oh dear! What shall we do when we run out of bullets?"
　　Siniu said: "It doesn't matter. If the enemy comes, throw a volley of grenades first, leaving two. Then fire two shots, leaving three bullets. Fix bayonets and fight them when the enemy comes. The machine guns behind us will definitely cover us."
　　After the enemy's fifth counterattack, there were only two grenades and two rifle bullets left. The soldiers were afraid again. Siniu dared not send anyone back to get ammunition, fearing that the person sent back would be wounded. So he discussed with everyone:
　　"If you can guarantee that we won't lose the position, I can guarantee that I'll bring back bullets."
　　Yang Cheng said: "If you guarantee that you'll bring back bullets, I guarantee that I'll repel the enemy's counterattack. If we lose the position, you can have my head. If the bullets run out, I'll fight with my bayonet."
　　Siniu crawled back and brought back eight grenades and fifty bullets. Everyone was very happy. It was noon, the sun was shining directly, there was no wind, and the corn leaves were curled up. The sweat on people's bodies seemed to be wrung dry. Everyone was dizzy, their eyes were black, their hearts were anxious, their mouths were sticky, and taking a few Rendan pills didn't help. Their tongues were dry and parched, and they didn't seem to be very nimble. The soldiers whispered again:
　　"Platoon leader, it's too dry, it's too dry...."
　　Siniu crawled back, even drier than them. But he knew that the kitchen hadn't sent water yet, and there was nothing to drink behind them. He remembered the encouragement they had given him in previous battles, and he said to everyone: "We are fighting a nail-in-the-ground battle. Our comrades are brave and tenacious. Wherever we fight, we must stick like a nail!"
　　The soldiers became quiet when they heard this sentence. Then he added: "We have already repelled the enemy's five counterattacks. Can we lose the position again because of thirst? If we retreat, just the few of us, three or four would be wounded, and the enemy would chase us. That would be too embarrassing, too uneconomical."
　　After he said this, the soldiers' hearts brightened. Then, water and ammunition were crawled and sent over, and the enemy, from then on, only fired small artillery and rifle grenades, but dared not come out again.
　　Who says we are not fighting a nail-in-the-ground battle? There are many such things. Company Commander Feng Quanzhu and Platoon Leader Jiang Yupen also led their comrades to repel the enemy's six counterattacks, and then fought with the enemy three times at night, taking down a bunker. We consolidated our position on the enemy's front line.
　　2. If there are more enemies, defeat them.
　　On the night of the 14th, Zhao Chengzhou, under the fierce attack of our artillery fire, sneaked into Xiaochang Village. They had already issued an order to break through at 9:00 p.m. on the 15th. But at 7:30 p.m. that night, the sound of the People's Liberation Army's attack artillery rang out. We set off from the position we had already acquired, extended the communication trenches, and prepared to attack the isolated small temple in the northeast of the village from the front, and then break into the village from there.
　　This time, the 2nd Company rushed up and blew up the small temple. Because of the killing power of the enemy's flanking fire, the follow-up troops could not come up and could not advance. Comrade Bi Sanlou of the 1st Company led the assault group and rushed to the enemy's single-person bunker with a volley of grenades, but was also beaten back. The second time, the company commander followed him. Bi Sanlou attacked again but was beaten back. He reported to the company commander: "The enemies are all hiding in single-person bunkers, there are many of them..."
　　The company commander said: "If there are more enemies, then fight them; can we make them fewer by not fighting?"
　　So the company commander and them together threw another volley of grenades, and the enemies jumped out of the single-person bunkers and fled to the small temple.
　　Suddenly, a shell fell with a sound like a cloth bag hitting the wall. It was very clear in the moonlight: a puff of gray smoke and a puff of white smoke intertwined and came out. Company Commander's Feng Jinxian's mouth and nose flowed with acid, his throat felt a burning sensation; his head was dizzy, and everything in his eyes was blue. He quickly sprinkled some urine on the mask and put it on, but it was too late. The enemy had released poison gas, covering an area fifty meters wide and seventy or eighty meters deep. All the soldiers in the battalion were lying on the ground, unable to get up. At this time, it was extremely dangerous. But we organized the firepower on both wings to block the area and protect the poisoned comrades, and the enemy did not dare to come down.
　　3. Advance in the artillery fire.
　　Two hours later, our artillery fire fell on the enemy's fortifications. Lightning-like flames burst out in the night sky, and the enemies all shrank into the bomb shelters. They still wanted to follow the old rules and jump out to meet our infantry attack after our shells were finished. They were so terrified that they shouted blindly everywhere:
　　"Get ready, the enemy is coming."
　　"Get ready, the enemy is coming."
　　But the soldiers of the 5th Company of our 3rd Battalion jumped forward amidst the sound of the artillery explosions. They were very familiar with the places where our shells were about to fall. Before a volley of artillery had finished, the demolition team Li Meizhen and An Jiuyue had already placed the demolition poles against the back wall of the small temple. When our shells finished, the demolition team pulled the firing line, and a room of the small temple collapsed.
　　At this time, the small temple could not hide the enemies anymore. The enemies hiding in the fortifications in the southwest corner of the temple were still firing at us from the side. Zhao Kaoxiang, the deputy platoon leader of the 3rd Platoon, quickly led the 9th Squad up and drove the enemies in the northern trench of the temple to the southern trench with a volley of grenades. They immediately broke into the small temple and threw grenades around the temple. Liberated soldier Niu Sanfu was wounded. Squad Leader Liu Haihe of the 9th Squad said to him: "I am also wounded, it's nothing, it's better to eliminate the enemy than anything else!" They brushed their wounds as if brushing away dust, and continued to fight. It was almost dawn, and the enemies east of the temple had not retreated. Deputy Squad Leader Gang ran over to blow it up, but the enemies counterattacked and he was wounded. They threw a volley of grenades and suppressed the enemies into the trench. Liu Haihe and Niu Sanfu climbed to the top of the trench and threw a volley of grenades. Some of the enemies fled, and some were still in the trench. Wang Xiaojiu and Li Gonglin jumped into the trench, climbed up through the trench, and blew up a dilapidated house east of the temple. Before the bricks lifted by the explosives had finished falling, the 6th Company had broken into the village from their breach.
　　This small temple faced east. In front of the temple gate, the enemies built a north-south communication trench, which was connected to the fortifications around the outside of their village. No matter where we broke in, we could be attacked by the enemy's flanking fire. However, when the 6th Company broke into the village, the 4th Company had already held off the enemies in the trench south of the temple and expanded the breach to the south. Squad Leader Liu Haihe of the 9th Squad also led his squad to drive out all the enemies in the northern communication trench. A pair of hard "walnut shells" was broken.
　　4. Regardless of everything, crush the enemy.
　　After the "walnut shell" was smashed, the soldiers charged bravely. All ten or so members of the assault group of the 6th Company were wounded, but none of them left the front line. They completely forgot about themselves. Some knew that they were wounded, while others lost the sense of pain in the intense battle and did not know that they were wounded at all. Company Commander Liang Dexiang was wounded three times, Platoon Leader Du Huangqiu was wounded twice, and Squad Leader Lu Yaoting of the 2nd Squad was also wounded twice. However, they did not want the soldiers to know this, and the soldiers also knew their psychology, and just gently and considerately said: "Company Commander, there is something red on your body!" The company commander said "It doesn't matter", waved his hand, and led the soldiers to charge again.
　　When they occupied the first courtyard and repelled the enemy's counterattack, they ran out of ammunition. The soldiers picked up the bullets scattered on the ground by the enemy and fired them, and took the ammunition from the prisoners. The enemy had been besieged for nearly ten days, and they did not have much ammunition either. When the second courtyard was blown up, Platoon Leader Du Huangqiu grabbed the ladder and went up to the roof. The enemies also came up from the opposite side. They thought they were their own people and quickly asked:
　　"Which part are you from?"
　　"The People's Liberation Army is here!" Zhu Guiqiu said, giving him a grenade and a rifle shot. The enemy cried out and rolled off the roof. The enemies at the bottom of the roof shouted: "They are on the roof", and threw grenades up from below. Zhu Guiqiu's grenades also ran out. He was just saying to the soldiers: "If the enemies come up, throw bricks at the son of a bitch!" Company Commander Yang Dexiang told him to come down quickly. As soon as he jumped off the ladder, there was a loud bang, and the courtyard was blown up again. They could not see anything in the smoke, and rushed to the third string of courtyards; there, the enemies were separated from them by a wall, and the grenades they threw could not reach them. They threw two incendiary bombs and fired two bursts of machine gun fire, suppressing the enemies. The fourth string of courtyards was the enemy's division headquarters. Those big officials were more afraid of death than the soldiers and had already fled, leaving behind crisscrossing telephone lines at the door.
　　When the division headquarters fled, the enemy collapsed across the board, like a group of ants whose nest had been smashed, desperately running towards Xiaochang Village from all directions. Some fell as soon as they got up, and some fell and then got up again. Some crawled, some rolled. At this time, the commanders and fighters stood up excitedly, clapping their hands to watch our artillery's fire pursuit. Our artillery shells followed the enemy's footsteps, exploding violently amidst their screams...

　　勇猛攻占西范村
    耿西
  　一、“我们打的是钉子仗”。
    “同志们英勇顽强，
    我们打的是‘钉子仗’；
    无论打到哪里，
    就跟钉在哪里一样。”
    目前，在我们部队里，这样的口号已经很流行了。我们无论打到哪里，多少倍的敌人也无法攻动，如果他们不投降，便只有被歼灭了。七月十二号，我们攻占了大常镇，歼灭暂三十四军以后，早已陷入重重包围之中的赵承绶集团，只剩两个师，被压缩在西范和小常两个小村了。赵承绶还把他的总部和三十三军军部，塞在不满五十口人家的西范村，固守待援，这当然是一副挨打的架子，一种准备就歼的姿态。这是一场激烈的战斗，这战斗决定了赵承绶必然当俘虏的命运。
    十四号清晨，一阵猛烈的炮击之后，某连二排副王四牛带着他的突击组冲到敌人的前沿。但他回头一看，只剩七八个人了。原来敌人接受了大常镇被歼的教训，害怕我们猛烈炮火的杀伤，利用村外三道水渠构成工事，把西范和小常村联结环绕起来，轻重火器和主力也都布置在那里了。当我们强大的炮火猛烈轰击的时候，他们躲在利用水渠修成的避弹坑里，很难发觉。等王四牛冲到离敌人十几米达的时候，我们的炮火所扬起的灰烟消失了，一排黑乌乌的机枪，出现在王四牛的面前，蓦地冒出几排子弹。于是他发现了他们只有七八个人能冲上来的原因。这里是一片好几百米达宽的开阔地，稍一露头便有危险。他们紧贴在只有尺把来高的玉茭地里，用铁锹把头脑前面的土推了推，想利用它暂时遮掩一下，准备马上出击。
    一阵小炮，一阵枪榴弹过后，敌人戴着钢盔，掂着刺刀扑过来了，他们一排手榴弹把敌人打回去，敌人的子弹也穿透了他们临时遮身的积土。一个同志牺牲了，一个同志挂了彩。
    接连着又打垮了敌人两次反扑，这时候只剩下王四牛、杨诚、宋才顺、李天成、梁有兴等五个人了，手榴弹还剩了十三个，子弹只有十发了。
    第四次打垮敌人反扑以后，敌人有三个彩号，躺在地下只哼哼，旁边还有三个敌人看着他们不走了。王四牛心里着急起来，他和大家说：“这三个人不走怎样办呢？他们看出我们就只五个人那就糟了。”临汾解放战士李天成拿起一颗手榴弹说：“我爬上去给他一家伙，看它走不走。”手榴弹一响，只听哎呀一声，那三个家伙跑了，挂彩的敌人也再不哼哼了。这时候他们又接着打了敌人一阵，只剩下五颗手榴弹，五粒子弹了，战士们害了怕，小声的叫唤着：
    “哎呀！没有子弹了怎样办？”
    四牛说：“不要紧，敌人来了先打一排手榴弹，剩下两颗。再打它两枪，剩三粒子弹。上起刺刀来，敌人来了跟他拼，我们后面的机枪看到了一定要掩护咱们的。”
    敌人五次反扑以后，就是只剩两颗手榴弹，两粒步枪子弹了。战士们又害怕了。四牛不敢打发人回去取弹药，害怕差回去的人再挂了彩，于是，他和大家商量说：
    “你们能保证不失阵地，我就能保证拿回子弹来。”
    杨诚说：“你保证拿回子弹来，我保证打退敌人反扑，丢了阵地，你要我的脑袋，子弹打完了，我用刺刀拼。”
    四牛爬回去，拿了八颗手榴弹，五十发子弹来，大家很高兴。这时候天正晌午了，太阳直射着，一点风也没有，玉茭叶儿都卷起来了。人身上的汗水似乎都绞干了，大家头昏、眼黑、心焦、嘴里黏糊糊的，吃点仁丹也不顶事。舌头干的发燥，似乎不怎样灵便了，战士们又低声的叫唤着：
    “排长，干的不行，干的不行呀………”
    四牛爬回来，比他们干的更厉害。但是，他知道火房还没有送水来，后面也没喝的。他想起了历次战斗中给他们的鼓励，他给大家讲道：“我们打的是钉子仗，我们同志是英勇顽强的，打到那里就要钉在那里！”
    战士们一听到这句话便安静了。接着他又补充道：“我们已经打退了敌人五次反扑了，还能因为渴再失了阵地，就我们这几个人，退回去也得挂彩三四个，敌人还要撵，那太丢人，太不上算了。”  　他这一讲，战士们心里明亮了。接着，后面的水、弹药都爬着送来了，而敌人从此以后，光打小炮，打枪榴弹，却不敢再出来了。
    谁说我们打的不是钉子仗呢？这样的事情多得很，一连长冯全柱，三排长蒋玉盆同样带着他们的同志，打退了敌人六次反扑，晚上又与敌人争夺三次，拿下了一个地堡。我们巩固了在敌人前沿的阵地。
    二、敌人多了，打垮它。
    十四日晚上，赵承绶在我们炮火猛烈攻击之下，溜到小常村去了。他们已经下达了命令，准备十五号夜晚九点钟突围。但是，当晚七点半钟的时候，人民解放军攻击的炮声打响了，我们从已取得的阵地出发，伸长了交通壕，准备从正面攻占村东北的孤立小庙，再从那里突进村去。
    这一次二连冲上去，爆破了小庙。因为敌人侧射火力的杀伤，后续部队上不来，不能前进了。一连毕三楼同志领着突击组，一溜手榴弹冲到敌人单人掩体前面，也被打下来了。第二次连长跟在他后面，毕三楼攻上去又被打下来了，他报告连长说：“敌人尽躲在单人掩体里，多得很……”
    连长说：“敌人多了打嘛；不打还能少得了。”
    于是连长和他们一起，又一阵手榴弹打上去，敌人从单人掩体里跳出来，逃到小庙里了。
    突然，一颗炮弹，带着象土布袋打在墙上那样的声音落下来了。月亮地里看得很清楚：一股灰烟，一股白烟渗绞着冒出来，一连长口鼻里流出酸水，喉咙里一阵辣；脑袋发昏，眼睛里什么都是蓝蓝的了。他赶紧在口罩上撒些尿戴上去，但是，已经迟了。敌人放了毒，宽五十米，纵深七八十米以内尽是毒气，冯金弦跑下来和营长握了握手，便什么都不知道了。营长也中毒了。全营战士爬在地下起不来，这时候危险极了。但我们组织两翼的火力封锁，保护了中毒的同志，敌人也不敢下来了。
    三、在炮火中跃进。
    两个钟头以后，我们的排炮落到敌人的工事上了，夜空里爆出了闪电似的火光，敌人都龟缩到避弹坑里去了，他们还想循照老规矩，等我们炮弹发完了，再跳出来迎接我们的步兵攻击，他们恐怖得太厉害了，到处盲目的惊叫着：
    “准备好，敌人上来了。”
    “准备好，敌人上来了。”
    但是，我们三营五连的战士，就在炮弹爆炸声中，跳跃着前进了，他们非常熟悉我们的炮弹将要落到的地方。一个排炮还没有落完，爆炸组李美珍和安九月已经把爆炸杆子靠到了小庙的后墙上，等我们的炮弹落完，爆炸组一拉火线，小庙的一间房子塌下来了。
    这时候小庙里是藏不住敌人了的，庙西南角躲在工事里的敌人却还在向我们侧射。三排副赵考祥赶紧带着九班上去，一排手榴弹把敌人撵到庙南的壕沟里。他们马上突进小庙，向庙周围投弹。解放战士牛三福挂了彩，九班长刘海和跟他说：“我也挂了彩，没啥，把敌人消灭了比啥都好！”他们象拂去灰尘似的，拂了拂他们的伤口，又干起来。天快亮了，庙东的敌人还未退，五班副刚跑过去爆炸，敌人反扑过来挂了彩，他们一排手榴弹，把敌人压倒壕里。刘海和与牛三福爬到壕顶上投了一阵手榴弹，敌人有的逃跑了，有的还在壕沟里。王小九、李贡林便跳进壕里，又通过壕沟爬起来，爆破了庙东的一座破房子。被炸药掀起来的砖块还未落完，六连已从他们的爆破口突进村了。
    这座小庙是座西朝东的。庙门前，敌人修了直通南北的交通壕，和他们村外四周的工事联结起来。我们从任何一点突进来，都可以遭到敌人的侧射。但是，六连突进村的时候，四连已经顶住庙南壕沟里的敌人，向南扩大缺口。九班长刘海和又带着他的班把北交通壕里的敌人都驱逐了。一双坚硬的“核桃壳”打破了。
    四、不顾一切，摧垮敌人。
    “核桃壳”砸破后，战士们勇猛的突击。六连的突击组十来个人全部挂了彩，没有一个下火线的。他们完全忘记了自己。有的挂了彩是自己知道的，有的则在紧张的战斗中，失掉了痛的感觉，根本不知道挂了彩。连长梁德相带了三次彩，一排长杜黄秋挂了两次，二班长吕耀庭也挂了两次。然而，他们不愿让战士们知道这一点，战士们也知道他们这种心理，只是轻轻的体贴的说：“连长，看你身上有了红的！”连长说声“不要紧”，一摆手又带着战士们冲击了。
    占领了第一座院子，他们打退敌人的反扑时，把弹药打光了。战士们拾起敌人撒在地上的子弹打上去，收下俘虏身上的弹药打上去，敌人被围将近十天，弹药也不多了。第二座院子爆炸开，一排长杜黄秋抓住梯子就上房。敌人也从对面上，他们还以为是自己人，赶紧问：
    “你是那一部分？”
    “解放军来了！”朱贵秋一边说着，就给了他一手榴弹，再加一步枪，敌人唉呀一声，滚下房去了。房底下的敌人乱叫：“他们上房了”，从底下打上手榴弹来。朱贵秋的手榴弹又打光了，他正跟战士们说：“敌人上来了拿砖砸狗日的！”连长杨德相却叫他赶紧下来，他刚蹦下梯子，轰然一声巨响，那座院子又一次被爆炸了。他们在烟雾之中，什么也看不见，又冲到了第三串院子；那里敌人和他们隔着一道墙，手榴弹打过来探不到他们。他们打了两颗燃烧弹，两梭子机枪，便把敌人压下去了。第四串院是敌人的师部，那些大官们比士兵更怕死，早就逃跑了，门边上留下了纵横交错的电话线。
    师部一逃跑，敌人全线溃乱了，象一群砸了窝的蚂蚁，从四面八方，拼命向小常村狂奔。他们有的刚爬起来又跌倒，有的跌倒了又爬起来。爬的爬，滚的滚。这时候，指战员们兴奋的立起身来，拍着手看我们炮兵的火力追击，我们的炮弹群跟着敌人的脚步，在他们的惊叫声中，猛烈爆炸着………。
