The Joint Office of the Agricultural Bureaus of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Governments Calls for Universal Autumn Plowing to Prevent Insect Pests

[This newspaper report] Everywhere is already placing importance on the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat planting, and have made many preparations, and successively issued instructions. Currently, a movement is generally beginning to form in most areas. However, many areas still do not sufficiently emphasize autumn plowing and the organization of labor and livestock. For example, the statement from Central Hebei that "areas without the habit of autumn plowing can carry it out with a focus" is one such instance. To overcome this situation, the Agricultural Bureau of the Joint Office of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Governments is once again calling for carrying out autumn plowing with the strength used for spring plowing. Excerpts:

This year, our region has suffered widespread insect pests. Through vigorous capture efforts in various areas, a major disaster was averted, but still, relatively severe losses were incurred, and a great deal of labor was expended. Therefore, resisting insect disasters must start with prevention, and the most effective method of prevention is autumn plowing. After autumn plowing, insect eggs and pupae in the soil are turned up to the surface, and after freezing, sun exposure, and being eaten by birds, they can die, avoiding a disaster. In recent years, due to the impact of the war in our region, there has been a lack of labor, and autumn plowing has not been widespread. As a result, insect disasters occur every year. In particular, the erroneous struggle against middle peasants during the land reform in many areas last winter affected the stability of the masses' emotions, and a large amount of land was not autumn-plowed, becoming one of the reasons for this year's severe insect pests (of course, climate, humidity, etc., are also reasons). Moreover, in addition to preventing insect disasters, autumn plowing can also prevent some diseases, improve the soil, increase fertilizer efficiency, and conserve moisture, reducing the threat of drought next year. In order to prevent the fruits of next year's major production movement from being lost to insect pests, we must seize this year's autumn plowing and ensure that all cultivated land in the region is plowed at least once.

In order to successfully complete autumn plowing, autumn plowing, autumn harvesting, and wheat planting must be closely integrated. All possible forces must be organized to participate in autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and wheat planting, each doing their best, to the greatest extent possible. Semi-auxiliary labor should be assigned to threshing, hulling grain, pushing millstones, etc. tasks that they can handle, so that able-bodied young and middle-aged labor and livestock can be freed up to carry out autumn plowing, achieving harvesting on one piece of land and plowing on another, plowing and planting as we go, without wasting a single unit of labor or livestock power.

To give the masses sufficient time for autumn plowing, all unnecessary meetings and work should be suspended, and even some necessary meetings and work should be postponed as much as possible, and official duties should be stopped or reduced as much as possible. For example, the Taiyue area has stipulated that official duties be suspended for one month (except for war service). Other areas are also preparing to determine the date of suspension based on the specific situation, depending on the length of time for autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and wheat planting. All government agencies, schools, and rear-area troops should organize a certain amount of labor and livestock power to help the masses with autumn plowing with the strength used for spring plowing and autumn harvesting, and the livestock of all state-owned enterprises should also be rented out to the masses for plowing as much as possible.

Areas with serious insect disasters this year are mostly areas that had less autumn plowing in the past, which are also areas where autumn plowing is particularly important. These areas are, on the contrary, lacking in labor and livestock power, making autumn plowing the most difficult. Therefore, the organization of labor and livestock mutual aid must be strengthened, leadership must be strengthened, and in some plains, where farmers have the custom of hiring livestock from mountain areas to plow the land (some call it "selling cattle hours"), this custom should be organized, advocated, and promoted to all areas with labor and livestock power difficulties, regulating livestock from neighboring villages and regions, but it must be for a price, and both parties must be willing and mutually beneficial. Where possible, some of the livestock from rear-area government agencies and troops can be transferred to these areas with livestock power difficulties to ensure that universal autumn plowing can be carried out once.

In order to stabilize and improve farmers' production enthusiasm and carry out autumn plowing, villages where land reform has been completed should confirm ownership and issue land certificates. In villages where land reform has not been completed, the principle of "whoever plants it harvests it" announced this spring must be resolutely implemented during the autumn harvest, and it must be announced again. Many areas have announced the completion of land reform, confirming land rights, and have also announced "whoever plants it harvests it" in areas where it has not been completed. Southern Hebei, Taihang, and Taiyue have also announced that those who carry out pre-sowing land redistribution on already cultivated but not yet sown land will be compensated with a considerable price to the original cultivators. These measures are all conditions for ensuring the smooth completion of autumn plowing.

Because most areas have suffered from disasters such as floods, droughts, diseases, and insect pests this year, and at the same time have the condition of abundant rainfall, we must seize the opportunity to lead the masses in planting wheat, expanding the wheat field area, increasing the summer harvest next year, and shortening the threat of spring famine. To this end, we must mobilize the masses to use the fertilizer accumulated this autumn as much as possible for wheat fields (and accumulate a large amount of fertilizer this winter and next spring for spring sowing). In areas without accumulated fertilizer or lacking seeds, the cooperative and production promotion agency should coordinate. On the other hand, to avoid yellow dwarf disease, variety replacement should be promoted in wheat planting; superior varieties should be promoted; and seed disinfection should be promoted: warm water soaking, mixing with alcohol, mixing with asphalt, and applying arsenic sulfide to prevent diseases and insect pests.

### 晋冀鲁豫、晋察冀两区政府联合办公处农业厅号召　普遍秋耕预防虫害

　　晋冀鲁豫、晋察冀两区政府联合办公处农业厅号召
  　普遍秋耕预防虫害
    【本报讯】各地对秋收秋耕种麦已经重视，作了许多准备工作，并先后发出指示，目前一般地区，且已开始形成运动。但许多地区，对秋耕工作及劳畜力组织，仍然强调不够。如冀中提出：“无秋耕习惯的，可以有重点的进行，”即是一例。为克服这一情况，晋冀鲁豫与晋察冀两区政府联合办事处农业厅特再次号召以春耕的力量进行秋耕。略称：
    今年我区普遭虫害，经各地大力捕捉，未成大灾，但仍遭到相当严重的损失，且花费劳力甚巨。因之，抗拒虫灾，必须从预防着手，而预防最有效的方法是秋耕。经过秋耕，地中虫卵、虫蛹等翻出地面，经冻、晒、鸟吃，即可死亡，避免成灾。几年来我区因战争影响，劳动力缺乏，秋耕不普遍，因之，虫灾每年发生。尤以去冬许多地区土改中错斗中农等偏向，影响群众情绪不稳，大量土地未进行秋耕，成为今年严重虫害的原因之一（当然气候、湿度等也是原因）。且秋耕的作用除预防虫灾外，并能防除部分病害，改良土壤，增加肥效，保存水分，减少明年旱灾威胁。为了明年大生产运动果实不为虫害而受损失，必须抓紧今年秋耕，保证全区耕地至少普耕一次。
    为了秋耕的胜利完成，必须使秋耕秋收种麦紧密结合。必须组织一切可能动员的力量，参加秋收秋耕种麦，各尽其能，尽量使半辅劳力担任打场、掏谷、推碾磨………等他们所能担任的活，以便抽出青壮年整劳力及牲畜进行秋耕，做到收一片，耕一片，随种随耕，不浪费一个劳力，不浪费一个畜力。
    为使群众有充分时间进行秋耕，暂停一切不必要的会议与工作，即使一些必要的会议与工作，也应尽可能的推后进行，并尽可能停止或减少勤务。如太岳已规定停止支差一月（战勤除外）。其他地区亦正在准备按具体情况，视秋收秋耕种麦的时间长短，定出停差日期，各机关学校后方部队，均应组织一定人畜力，以帮助春耕、秋收的力量帮助群众秋耕，各公营企业之牲口也应当尽可能的让群众雇用耕地。
    今年虫灾严重的地区，多是过去秋耕少的地区，也就是秋耕特别重要的地区，这些地区反而劳畜力缺乏，秋耕最困难，因此，必须加强劳畜互助的组织，加强领导，有些平原，农民曾有雇用山地牲口耕地习惯的（有的叫卖牛晌），则应根据这一习惯，加以组织倡导，推广这一习惯到一切劳畜力困难的地区，调剂邻村邻区的牲口，但必须有代价，而且要双方自愿两利。在可能条件下，可调动一部分后方机关部队的牲畜到这些畜力困难的地方，以保证能普遍秋耕一次。
    为了稳定与提高农民生产情绪，进行秋耕，土改完成的村庄，确定所有权，发给土地证。土改未完成之村，在秋收中要坚决执行今春宣布的谁种谁收，并再次宣布谁种谁收。现许多地区均已先后宣布土改完成，确定地权，也宣布了未完成的地区谁种谁收，冀南、太行、太岳并宣布在已耕未种前进行抽补者，给原耕地人以相当代价的补偿，这些措施都是保证顺利完成秋耕的条件。
    因为今年大部地区遭受水旱病虫等灾，同时又有雨量充足的条件，我们必须抓紧领导群众种麦，扩大麦田面积，增加明年夏收，缩短春荒威胁。为此，必须动员群众，将今秋所积之肥料，尽量用于麦地（今冬、明春再大量积肥用于春播）。没有积肥的，及种子缺乏等地区，应由合作社及生产推进社调剂。另方面，为避免黄黑疸，在种麦中应提倡换种；推广优良品种；提倡种子消毒：温汤浸种，拌酒，拌柏油，上信石（砷）等防除病虫等害。
