　　*New Era* Evaluates the Third UN General Assembly
  　The United Nations Faces a New Severe Test
    The United States Will Have New Tricks
  　Appropriate Counterattacks Must Be Made
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th] TASS dispatch: *New Era Weekly* published an editorial entitled "The Third United Nations General Assembly," stating: The United Nations has failed in the past to meet the hopes placed in it by peace-loving countries. Its record of activities shows that it has committed many serious mistakes and made many decisions that have undermined the prestige of the United Nations. These mistakes are the result of American imperialism's deliberate attempt to turn the institution that guarantees international cooperation and world peace into a tool of Wall Street. The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are fighting to defend the goals and ideals of the United Nations. If the enemies of international cooperation have not yet succeeded in completing their conspiracy, this is mainly due to the Soviet Union's unyielding policy of peace. All the commendable achievements of the United Nations have been obtained through the advocacy of the Soviet Union. The resolution of the First General Assembly on universal disarmament and the destruction of atomic weapons, as well as the resolution of last autumn's General Assembly condemning the instigators of a new war, were all proposed by Soviet representatives. The American imperialists, blinded by the concept of world hegemony, have shown astonishing clumsiness in learning historical lessons after the war. It can be expected that there will be new tricks in the Third General Assembly in order to achieve the goals that the United States has not yet achieved. Many signs indicate that the United States intends to put the United Nations to a new severe test, even at the risk of undermining the United Nations. Lie's report with ulterior motives is a sign. The democratic people of all countries will closely watch the proceedings of the Third General Assembly. They demand that the enemies of international cooperation be given appropriate counterattacks, and hope that the resolutions that have been passed will be implemented and that appropriate handling of urgent issues related to security will begin.

　　新时代评三届联大
  　联合国面临新的严重考验
    美国还会有新的花样
  　必须予以适当的反击
    【新华社陕北廿六日电】塔斯社讯：新时代周刊以“第三届联合国大会”为题发表社论称：联合国过去并未能符合爱好和平国家所寄予的希望。它的活动纪录显示：它曾犯了许多严重的错误，作出了许多破坏联合国威信的决定。这些错误的产生乃是美帝国主义立意将保障国际合作与世界和平的机构变为华尔街工具的结果。苏联和人民民主国家正为保卫联合国的目标与理想而奋斗。如果说国际合作的敌人至今还未能完成他们的阴谋，那么这主要地应归功于苏联不屈不挠的和平政策。联合国一切被人称誉的成绩，都是由于苏联的倡导而获得的。第一届大会关于普遍裁减军备及毁灭原子武器的决议及去秋大会关于谴责新战争挑拨者的决议，都是苏联代表所提出的。被世界霸权观念冲昏头脑的美帝国主义者，在战后学习历史教训中显得惊人的笨拙。可以预期，为了达到美国迄今还未成功的目的，第三届大会中还会有新的花样。许多迹象显示：美国打算把联合国置于新的严重考验中，甚至不惜冒使联合国垮台的危险。莱氏的别有用心的报告就是一种征候。一切国家的民主人民将密切注意第三届大会的议事。他们要求予国际合作的敌人以适当的反击，期望实行已通过的决议并对与安全有关的紧要问题开始作适当的处理。
