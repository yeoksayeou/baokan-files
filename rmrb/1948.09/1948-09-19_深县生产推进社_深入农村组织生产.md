　　Shen County Production Promotion Cooperative
　　Deeply Penetrates Rural Areas to Organize Production

[Central Hebei News] The Shen County Production Promotion Cooperative was transformed from the county store this spring. During the transformation, a thorough business inspection was conducted, and the operation of goods that were not urgently needed for farmers' production was completely changed. The five branches were changed into seven sub-cooperatives, and the spirit of supporting farmers' production became clearer than before. However, the old methods and styles of business operation have not yet been transformed, and they are still waiting for customers at the counter, unable to penetrate the rural areas. On June 15th, a joint meeting of sub-cooperative directors was held, at which the slogans "Transform methods" and "Business goes to the countryside" were put forward. The specific practices of business work were clarified: (1) The task of each promotion sub-cooperative should be to deeply penetrate rural areas to organize production. The sub-cooperatives do not carry out procurement. The general cooperative uniformly procures according to the needs of the masses reflected by each sub-cooperative and distributes them to each sub-cooperative for promotion. (2) Except for one or two people (accountant plus trainee) to take care of the store, all other business personnel of each sub-cooperative should go to the countryside to work, and find business from the work in the countryside. (3) When business personnel of each sub-cooperative go to the countryside, on the one hand, they should help the masses with production, and on the other hand, they should carry out supply and marketing business. Organize the masses to invest the distributed floating wealth into production to prevent waste, and use this to develop the supply and marketing business of the Promotion Cooperative. From June 15th to the end of July, in one and a half months, in terms of organizing the investment of floating wealth into production, according to incomplete statistics from seven villages including Mu Village: 15 waterwheels were bought with floating wealth, more than 600 hoe blades, 3 livestock, and many other production tools such as chaff cutters and plows. In solving the problem of alfalfa (fodder) planting for the masses, the masses in the whole county need a total of 20 catties of alfalfa seeds. The county cooperative has bought 1,800 catties and distributed them to various sub-cooperatives to sell to the masses. It is estimated that 2,000 mu can be planted. The masses lacked cart bodies, so they provided loans to support the organization of two wooden goods factories, which produced 600 water buckets. In the past, the practice of supply and marketing business was from top to bottom, that is, goods were handled and distributed to various sub-cooperatives for promotion based on seasonal estimates. Therefore, the types and quantities of goods often did not meet the needs of the masses, making the goods unsalable. After the business went to the countryside, the combination of top-down estimation and bottom-up investigation gradually achieved complete conformity between supply and marketing business and the needs of the masses. The past counter-style operation tied the cadres to the market towns, and they could not often go to the countryside, so the tasks of organizing mass production and supporting the organization of mass cooperatives were difficult to achieve. After the business went to the countryside, more than 30 cadres were drawn from the whole cooperative to regularly help the masses plan and organize production, which laid a convenient foundation for organizing the work of mass cooperatives. In the past, supply and marketing business (must be in market towns) and agricultural loan work (must be in the countryside) were contradictory. Emphasizing supply and marketing business naturally relaxed agricultural loan work. Now that the supply and marketing business has gone to the countryside, it is naturally integrated under the general task of organizing farmers' production. At the same time, it will greatly reduce the cold goods in operation and speed up capital turnover.

In the process of implementing business going to the countryside, it will encounter various ideological and habitual obstacles. According to the experience of this period, to make "business going to the countryside" work well, the following points must be paid attention to: (1) Eliminate concerns and increase confidence. At the beginning, there were fears that less business would be done and no money would be made, and that "it would not be able to sustain itself." Some business cadres who were accustomed to counter operations and had not done mass work were very tricky about business going to the countryside and did not know where to start. Therefore, the leadership must personally take action, provide specific help, and use concrete facts to dispel their concerns and increase confidence. (2) Prevent the viewpoint of bestowing favors and the tendency of laissez-faire. On the one hand, business going to the countryside is for the better support of mass production, and on the other hand, it is for the better development of business. The two are unified. However, some cadres only accepted the former aspect and did not earn the money they should earn when selling goods, which is not right. (3) It must be clear that the business cadres going to the countryside should simultaneously bear the three regular tasks of developing supply and marketing business, handling agricultural loans, and supporting mass cooperatives. These three are unified in the task of helping mass production and should not be neglected. (Zhan Wu)

　　深县生产推进社
  　深入农村组织生产
    【冀中讯】深县生产推进社是今春从县商店转变来的，转变时曾进行过一次业务大检查，把不是农民生产上迫切需要的货品经营统统转了业。五个支店改成七个分社，扶植农民生产的精神比过去进一步明确了。但是过去经营业务的那套方式和作风仍未转变，仍然在柜台里等待顾客，不能深入农村。六月十五日开了个分社主任联席会，会上提出了“转变做法”，“业务下乡”口号。并明确了业务工作的具体做法：（一）各推进分社的任务应是深入农村组织生产，分社不进行采购，由总社根据各分社反映的群众要求统一采购，分发各分社推销。（二）各分社平日除留一到二人（会计加练习生）照应门市外，其他业务员应全部下乡工作，从下乡工作中找出业务来。（三）各分社业务员下乡，一方面扶助群众生产，另方面又要进行供销业务。组织群众将分得的浮财投入生产，防止浪费，并借此开展推进社的供销业务。从六月十五号到七月底，一个半月内，在组织浮财投入生产方面，据穆村等七个村不完全统计：用浮财买水车十五辆，锄板六百多个，牲口三头，还有铡刀、犁耙等很多生产工具。在解决群众种苜蓿（饲料）的问题上，全县群众共需苜蓿籽二十斤，县社已买来一千八百斤分到各分社卖给了群众，估计可种二千亩。群众缺乏车斗子，便贷款扶植组织了两个木货厂，打出水斗六百个。过去供销业务的做法是自上而下的，即根据对季节性的估计来办货，分发各分社推销，因而在货种上和数量上都往往不切合群众需要，使货卖不出去。业务下乡后，自上而下的估计与自下而上的调查结合起来，即逐渐做到供销业务与群众需要完全吻合。过去柜台式的经营，将干部束缚在集镇中，不能经常下乡，所以组织群众生产，扶植组织群众合作社的任务都很难实现；业务下乡后，全社抽出三十余名干部经常帮助群众计划组织生产，这就给组织群众合作社工作打下便利的基础。过去供销业务（必须在集镇中）与农贷工作（必须在乡下）是矛盾的，强调供销业务，就自然的放松了农贷工作。现在供销业务下了乡，在组织农民生产的总任务下自然结合起来。同时将大大减少经营中的冷货，加速资金周转。
    业务下乡在实行过程中会遭到各种思想和习惯上的阻碍。根据这一时期的经验，要使“业务下乡”作得好，必须注意以下几点：（一）消除顾虑，提高信心。开始时怕业务少做了，赚不了钱，“混不住吃”。有的习惯于柜台经营，没有做过群众工作的业务干部对业务下乡很棘手，不知从何下手。因此，领导上必须亲自下手，具体帮助，用具体事实来打消他们的顾虑，提高信心。（二）防止恩赐观点与自流倾向。业务下乡一方面为的更好的扶植群众生产，另方面也为的更好的开展业务，两者是统一的。但有的干部只接受了前一面，在卖货时应赚的钱也不赚，这是不对的。（三）必须明确下乡业务干部应同时负担开展供销业务，办理农贷与扶植群众合作社三种经常任务。这三者在帮助群众生产的任务中统一起来，不可偏废。（詹武）
