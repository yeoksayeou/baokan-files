Various Regions Actively Implement the Guiding Principles of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference
　　Rectify Enterprises and Improve Production
　　[Report from this newspaper] Since the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, public and private enterprises and industrial and commercial management departments in various parts of North China have begun to carry out inspections and rectifications. According to reports from various regions, the common bias in industrial and commercial management is to deal with urban problems from a rural perspective, mechanically transplanting rural struggle forms and production mutual aid organizational forms into all industrial and commercial enterprises, which seriously hinders the development of industry and commerce. In Changzhi City, various independent laborers and handicraft workshops were forcibly organized into mutual aid groups for collective operation, or mass funds were forcibly invested in private shops to change them into cooperative societies. Regardless of their production technology, cadres and activists were arbitrarily sent to serve as managers and accountants, and in some cases, poor and lower-middle peasants were sent to private shops to serve as "backbones." This has forced many industries to become depressed or collapse. In some mining areas in Wu'an, the "poor and lower-middle peasant line" was also emphasized, disregarding costs, raising wages, and lowering coal prices. Even if the coal baskets made by rural peasants were of extremely poor quality, factories were forced to purchase them at high prices, ostensibly to take care of mass production. Some village cadres in Yangquan City insisted on introducing workers to factories and stipulating wages. This spring, the policy was corrected, and the above phenomena were corrected in most areas. Compensation was also made to the industrialists and businessmen who had been struggled against. According to statistics from the 9th Sub-district of Central Hebei, a total of 1,490 industrialists and businessmen were infringed upon. By June, 1,235 had been corrected, 124 were being corrected, and only 41 had not been corrected. Another aspect of the rural perspective is the lack of attention to scientific management, one-sided emphasis on the immediate interests of the masses, and a lack of long-term construction concepts. Many coal mines in Yangquan only proceed from the current lives of the workers, arbitrarily mining and excavating, without regard for coal mine safety. In many areas of North Yue, no one repairs the factory buildings and shops that are borrowed or rented. General production management lacks long-term planning and does not focus on economic development. According to the inspections of the Taihang and Taiyue regions' industry and commerce conferences, industrial and commercial management departments have always emphasized taxation and neglected production. In the border areas, it is simply confiscation without actively organizing exports, while in the inland market, it is simply control. As late as recently in Gaoping, there were cases of arbitrarily increasing industrial and commercial taxes by 5 million yuan in order to increase fiscal revenue. In some areas of North Yue, industrial and commercial taxes even exceeded 34 percent of net profit (the North China Industry and Commerce Conference stipulated that it should not exceed 20 percent), and this has not been corrected. The operation of public and private enterprises underwent preliminary rectification this spring in various regions. The main problems were: first, wages were too high and the wage system was egalitarian; second, there were too many non-production personnel, and factory management was unreasonable and unscientific. The former has been widely abolished in various regions, and a fixed wage system has been adopted instead of the supply system, but unreasonable situations have not been completely eliminated. According to a survey of factories in Changzhi City, taking the pre-war period as a base, only individual factories were slightly lower than before the war, and the rest were increased to between 131 and 375 percent. In addition, there were supplementary wages that accounted for 80 percent of the formal wages. A factory in Taiyue was four times higher than before the war. Moreover, the wages of light industry are generally higher than those of heavy industry, and the difference between various different labor intensities, skilled workers and general workers and apprentices is also too small. In some coal mines in Yangquan City, wages are still determined according to the family composition of the workers. Non-production personnel account for a large proportion in various regions. In the Central Hebei region, they account for about 21 percent of the personnel in each factory. In the public-operated factories in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, they account for one-quarter, and in some cases, they account for half. In some factories in Taiyue, they account for one-third. In a factory in Taihang, there were only 30 workers, but there were 32 non-production personnel. Following this anti-enterprise production organization, various phenomena of wasted working hours and materials arose. In the Yonghua Chemical Plant in Central Hebei, only 15 percent of the formal production workers were working every day in May and June. In another factory, the actual production time was only two hours a day. In the public-operated factories in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, the formal production workers only reached 89.4 percent in June. Recently, various regions have been gradually improving. The egalitarianism of the wage system has been overcome more quickly, and wages have been generally evaluated according to labor intensity and production technology. Some factories in Shijiazhuang City have adopted a reasonable cross-progressive wage system, while most other regions have adopted piece-rate wages. Non-production personnel have also been greatly reduced. The management of various factories has largely implemented a strict economic accounting and cost accounting system, correcting the previous waste and chaos. According to statistics from the public-operated factories in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, the actual working hours of each factory have increased by 18 percent recently, and production efficiency has increased by 16 percent in some cases, and by 27.7 percent in others. Since the implementation of the cost accounting system, the cost of a match factory in Central Hebei has gradually decreased. Taking March as a base, the cost decreased to 88.9 percent in April, 81.7 percent in May, and 71.2 percent in June. In a factory in Taiyue, the cost was reduced by half. At present, industrial and commercial departments in various regions are still studying and improving in order to continue to correct policies and implement the guiding principles of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference.

　　各地积极贯彻华北工商会议方针
  　整顿企业提高生产
    【本报讯】华北各地公私企业及工商管理部门，自华北工商会议之后，均着手进行检查整顿。据各地报导：工商管理上的普遍偏向，为以农村观点处理城市问题，机械搬运农村斗争形式与生产互助组织形式到一切工商企业中去，严重地妨害了工商业发展。长治市曾强制各种独立劳动者和手工作坊，编成互助组集体经营，或向私人商店强行投入群众资金，改为合作社性质，并且不论其生产技术如何，随便派干部积极分子去当经理、会计，有的竟派贫雇农民到私人商店中去当“骨干”，这样逼使某些行业萧条或垮台者不少。武安有些矿区也强调“贫雇路线”，不顾成本，提高工资，减低煤价，乡村农民所制煤篓质量极坏，也得强制工厂以高价购买，名为照顾群众生产。阳泉市有些村干部硬给工厂介绍工人，规定工资。今春端正政策，曾对上述现象进行纠正，大部地区均已克服，被斗争的工商业也进行赔偿，据冀中九分区统计，被侵犯的工商业共一千四百九十家，至六月份已纠正一千二百三十五家，正在纠正的一百廿四家，未纠正的只四十一家。农村观点的另一方面，便是不重视科学管理，片面强调群众眼前利益，缺乏长期建设观念。阳泉的许多煤矿，只从目前工人的生活出发，随便开采挖掘，毫不顾及煤矿安全。北岳许多地区借住或租用的厂屋铺面坏了也无人修理，一般生产管理都缺乏长期计划，不是从发展经济着眼。据太行、太岳两区工商会议检查，工商管理部门一向着重税收，轻视生产。在边地是单纯没收，未积极组织输出，在内地市场又是单纯统制。高平直至最近，还有为增加财政收入，而擅自加派工商业税五百万元的事。北岳有些地区的工商业税，竟超过纯利百分之三十四（华北工商会议规定，不得超过百分之二十），而未改正。公私企业的经营，今年春间各地均曾进行初步整顿，主要问题，一是工资过高，及工资制度的平均主义；一是非生产人员过多，及工厂管理的不合理、不科学。前者各地已普遍废除供给制度采取定额工资制，但不合理情形还未完全肃清。长治市各工厂调查，以抗战前为基数，只个别工厂比战前略低，余皆提高至百分之一百三十一至三百七十五，此外尚有占正式工资达百分之八十的附属工资。太岳某厂比战前提高四倍。而且轻工业工资，一般竟比重工业为高，各种不同的劳动强度，技术工人与一般工人和学徒之间差额也太小，阳泉市某些煤矿，至今还有按工人家庭成份定工资者。非生产人员各地都占很大比重，冀中区约占各厂人员百分之二十一，冀鲁豫各公营工厂合计，占四分之一，其中有的竟占一半，太岳有些工厂占三分之一，太行某工厂全部工人只三十人，非生产人员却有三十二人。跟着这种反企业化的生产组织，各种浪费工时、材料现象随之而生，冀中永华化学厂五、六两月每天只有百分之十五的正式生产工，另一工厂每天实在生产时间只有二个钟头，冀鲁豫各公营工厂六月份合计，正式生产工也只达百分之八十九点四。最近各地已在逐渐改善，工资制度的平均主义克服比较迅速，普遍已按照劳动强度，生产技术评议工资。石家庄市有些工厂并已采用合理的交叉累进工资制，其他各地则多数采用计件工资。非生产人员也大大裁减，各工厂管理已大部实行严格的经济核算与成本计算制，纠正以前的浪费混乱现象。据冀鲁豫各公营工厂统计，最近各厂实用工时已增加百分之十八，生产效率有的提高了百分之十六，有的则提高至百分之二十七点七。冀中某火柴厂自实行成本计算制度以后，成本已逐渐降低，若以三月份为基数，四月份成本降低至百分之八十八点九，五月份降低至百分之八十一点七，六月份降低至百分之七十一点二。太岳某厂，成本降低一倍。现各地工商部门为继续端正政策，贯彻华北工商会议方针，仍在研究改进。
