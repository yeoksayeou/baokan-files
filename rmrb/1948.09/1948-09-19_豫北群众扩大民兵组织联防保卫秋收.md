【Taihang Telegram】The masses in the edge regions of northern Henan, such as Xiuwu, Wuzhi, and Jiaozuo, are actively demanding to protect the autumn harvest, and the militia self-defense forces have been further developed. Based on past experiences, the masses in the border areas of Xiuwu recognized the inevitability of the enemy seizing the autumn harvest, and they have requested grenades, landmines, and quick-firing guns to prepare for protecting the autumn harvest. In the past month alone, the area has developed more than 120 militiamen. A 16-year-old youth in Village × told our district cadres, "As long as we are armed, the enemy will not be able to seize our autumn harvest, and we will definitely be able to eat it." A certain village that has been constantly subjected to enemy looting, after our propaganda and education, aroused the masses' hatred of the enemy and organized two blasting groups. After breaking off the connections of a few individuals with the enemy and eliminating illusions about the enemy, a certain village in Wuzhi borrowed rifles from neighboring counties and also organized a militia to launch a struggle against the enemy. The leaders of the Second District firmly supported the masses' armed demands, and the villages successively restored village command posts, established militias, organized joint defense, and launched a blasting campaign. In Xiuwu's Anyangcheng Village, Wang Jizu, a middle peasant who had been properly redressed after correcting deviations, compensating, and revising his class status, automatically requested to join the militia. He said, "I have long wanted to be a militiaman to protect myself, but because I was said to be a rich peasant in the past, I have never dared to say anything." Jiaozuo also rectified its policies, corrected some of the "leftist" errors in the people's armed work in the past. Within twenty days, villages such as ×× restored 22 militias, newly developed 23 militiamen, and organized nearly 200 self-defense forces. In Xiuwu, the reasonable solution of issues such as the rotation of militiamen in combat, production, and combat service has greatly promoted the development of the militia. In mid-July, the county generally went through the process of calculating the work points for participation in combat, and the militiamen all received the labor service rice they deserved. Five people in Dongwanjie Village quickly joined the militia. After the Third District implemented the method of deploying militiamen on a rotational basis according to the amount of labor, the militias in the villages also experienced new development. The development and strengthening of the militia in the above-mentioned areas is an extremely important guarantee for winning the autumn harvest struggle. The militia in various places is still constantly increasing.

　　豫北群众扩大民兵组织联防保卫秋收
    【太行电】豫北修武、武陟、焦作等边缘区群众积极要求保秋，民兵自卫队又获得发展。修武边地群众根据过去的体验，认识了敌人抢秋的必然到来，纷纷要求发手榴弹地雷快枪等武器，准备保秋。该地一个月来仅民兵发展一百二十多名，×村一个十六岁的青年对我区干部说：“只要武装起来，敌人就抢不走咱的秋，保险能吃到嘴里。”不断遭受敌人抢劫的某村，经我宣传教育后，激起群众对敌仇恨，组织了两个爆炸组。武陟某村在打断了个别人和敌人连系，消除了对敌的幻想后，向邻近县借到步枪，亦组织起民兵，向敌展开斗争。二区领导上坚决支持群众的武装要求，各村先后恢复村指挥部，建立起民兵，组织联防，展开了爆炸运动。修武安阳城村经过确实纠偏，补偿及改订成份后的中农王吉祖即自动请求参加了民兵，他说：“我早就想干民兵保卫自己，因过去说我是富农，我就一直不敢吭。”焦作亦由于端正政策，纠正了过去在人民武装工作中的某些左倾错误，廿天内××等村恢复民兵二十二个，新发展了民兵二十三人，组织起自卫队近二百人。在修武因合理解决轮战民兵生产及参战勤务等问题，亦大大促进了民兵的发展。该县七月中旬普遍经过算参战工帐，民兵均得到了应得的勤工米，东万解村很快就有五个人参加了民兵。三区实行按劳力多少调集民兵轮战的办法后，各村民兵亦有了新发展。上述地区民兵的发展壮大，对争取秋收斗争的胜利是一个极重要的保障，现各地民兵仍在不断增加。
