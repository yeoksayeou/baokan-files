    [Jinzhong Electric Dispatch] With the assistance of the democratic government, the salt, alkali, and saltpeter industries in Fenyang and Yuci in Jinzhong are gradually recovering and developing. Fenyang County originally had 106 salt houses (excluding the salt houses in the urban area), but under the massive extortion of the Yan bandit, almost all of them collapsed. The Yan bandit stipulated that regardless of the size of the pot, each salt house had to pay eight or nine *shi* of rice as "tax"; regardless of whether the soil could be used to boil saltpeter, each person in the salt house had to be forcibly levied 50 *jin* of gunpowder saltpeter every month. In addition, the Yan bandit often blackmailed salt farmers on the pretext of "boiling saltpeter for the Eighth Route Army." Zhang Qifa of Dongmazhai was arrested for this reason and only escaped after handing over one *shi* of sorghum; Fan Yutang of Qingdui Village and two salt-boiling workers from Baijinbao in Dijia Community were beaten to death by the Yan bandit under this pretext. After the county was liberated, the democratic government posted notices to publicize our party's policy on industry and commerce, and abolished all the Yan bandit's harsh taxes and levies, and the salt and alkali industry was able to gradually recover. In the past month or so, seven salt pans, large and small, have been ignited, producing 2,600 *jin* of salt per day. According to statistics from 14 alkali houses in six natural villages, including Daxiang, Renyan, Xibao, Gufutu, and Da-Xiao Luocheng, 19,160 *jin* of alkali have been boiled in the past month, which can be exchanged for more than 67,000 *jin* of wheat. Furthermore, it is reported that the saltpeter industry in Yuci, which was strangled by the Yan bandit, is also gradually recovering with the support of the democratic government. During the Yan bandit's rule, it was stipulated that each saltpeter household had to hand in 600 *jin* of saltpeter per month, and the price given for each *jin* was not enough to buy two cigarettes. After liberation, the democratic government priced the saltpeter according to its quality, with a general price of no less than four *jin* of millet per *jin*, and in September, each saltpeter pot was given 5,000 *jin* of coal to solve the fuel difficulties of the saltpeter farmers. Now, the number of saltpeter factories in and around the city has increased from eleven to twenty-five, and another three are preparing to open.

　　民主政府废除阎匪苛杂
  　汾阳榆次盐硝业复活
    【晋中电】晋中汾阳、榆次盐、碱、硝业，经民主政府扶助，逐渐恢复与发展。汾阳县原有盐房一零六座（城关盐房在外），在阎匪大肆勒索下，几乎全部垮台。阎匪规定不管大小锅，每年均须交八、九石米的“税票”；也不管你这土能不能熬盐硝，每月要向盐房的每个人强征火硝五十斤。此外阎匪又常以“给八路军熬硝”的罪名敲榨盐民，东马寨张起发为此被抓去，交出高粱一石才逃出虎口；青堆村范玉堂与狄家社百金堡的两个熬盐工人，竟被阎匪借此乱棍打死。该县解放后，民主政府张贴布告，宣传我党工商业政策，废除了阎匪一切苛捐杂税，盐碱业才得以逐渐恢复。月余来，已有大小七个盐锅点火，每天可出盐二千六百斤。据大相、仁岩、西堡、古俘图、大小罗城等六个自然村十四座碱房一个月来的统计，已熬碱一万九千一百六十斤，可换麦六万七千余斤。又讯：被阎匪绞杀的榆次硝业，经民主政府的扶持，也已逐渐恢复。阎匪统治时，规定每家硝户每月交硝六百斤，每斤发价换不出两支纸烟。解放后，民主政府按硝质优劣发价，一般的每斤不低于四斤小米，并在九月份发给每个硝锅五千斤煤，解决硝民的燃料困难。现在城内及附近的硝厂，已由十一家增至二十五家，另有三家准备开张。
