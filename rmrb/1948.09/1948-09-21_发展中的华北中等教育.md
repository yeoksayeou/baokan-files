　　Developing Secondary Education in North China

　　The education sector in the North China Liberated Area has been continuously developing and innovating since the Anti-Japanese War, and has experienced even more vigorous growth in the past three years. According to recent incomplete statistics from various locations, there are 144 secondary schools scattered throughout the North China Liberated Area: including 43 middle schools established by administrative offices and municipalities/counties, 5 normal schools established by administrative offices and municipalities, 90 simplified normal schools established by counties, and 6 other vocational schools such as finance and economics schools. There are regularly 24,962 students enrolled in these schools. Specifically: 15,506 middle school students, accounting for more than half of all students; 7,128 normal school students; and 2,328 vocational school students. The distribution of these schools in various administrative offices and municipalities is as follows: The Taihang District has a total of 29 schools: 6 middle schools established by the administrative office, 2 normal schools, 1 finance and economics school, and 20 simplified normal schools established by counties. There are a total of 3,284 students. The Jinnan District has a total of 27 schools: 6 middle schools established by the administrative office, 3 vocational schools (agricultural school, finance and economics school, and telephone training school), and 18 simplified normal schools established by counties. There are a total of 3,263 students (statistics are missing from eight county normal schools). The Jizhong District has a total of 25 schools: 5 middle schools established by the administrative office, 20 simplified normal middle schools established by special commissioner's offices and counties, and some county-level higher primary schools also have attached middle school classes. There are a total of 6,369 students. The Beiyue District has a total of 22 schools: 7 middle schools established by the administrative office, 1 normal school, and 14 simplified normal schools established by counties. There are a total of 3,127 students. The Ji-Lu-Yu District has a total of 19 schools: 5 middle schools established by the administrative office and 14 simplified normal schools established by counties. There are a total of 3,407 students. The Taiyue District has a total of 18 schools: 6 middle schools established by the administrative office, 1 normal school, 1 political and civilian cadre school, and 10 simplified normal middle schools established by counties. There are a total of 3,637 students. Shijiazhuang City has a total of 4 schools: Municipal Middle School, Municipal Girls' Middle School, Municipal Normal School, and Construction College. There are a total of 1,875 students. In addition, the North China Central Bureau and the North China Government directly administer Yucai Middle School, with 450 students, as well as staff schools, finance and economics schools, accounting schools, and maternal and child health schools.

　　In approximately three years, the number of secondary schools in the North China Liberated Area has increased fourfold compared to the Anti-Japanese War period. According to statistics before the Japanese surrender: At that time, there were a total of 34 secondary schools in the entire North China region, 26 in the original Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area, and 8 in the Jin-Cha-Ji area, with 6,359 students. This was a truly remarkable achievement in the difficult environment of guerrilla warfare during the Anti-Japanese War. In the six months after the Japanese surrender and the first half of the second year, secondary schools developed rapidly. In the Jin-Cha-Ji area, the number of middle schools increased from 8 to 43, and the number of students increased from 1,655 to more than 6,000. Before the evacuation of Zhangjiakou, it further developed to 56 schools, with 10,350 students. The number of schools in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area also increased from 26 to 50. Due to the large influx of students into schools in various locations, the number of student classes in each school generally increased. For example, in the first half of 1946 in Taihang, the number of middle schools rapidly increased from 9 to 14, the number of classes from 35 to 61, and the number of students from 1,309 to 2,674. By the end of 1946, it had further increased to 71 classes with 3,500 students. In 1947, in order to meet the demand for teachers caused by the universal development of national education in various locations, Taihang County established 20 simplified normal schools with a total of 37 classes, training 1,480 teachers. In other areas such as Jinnan, Taiyue, and Ji-Lu-Yu, secondary schools also experienced rapid development in a short period.

　　After the Japanese surrender, the vigorous development of secondary schools in the North China Liberated Area was due, on the one hand, to the adaptation of educational workers in various locations to the new situation, making every effort to expand and establish new schools. On the other hand, it was due to our correct implementation of policies towards intellectuals in the newly recovered cities, which allowed us to quickly restore the schools we took over. For example, after Jin-Cha-Ji recovered Zhangjiakou and other cities, middle schools quickly reopened. After Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu recovered Jining, schools such as the No. 7 Middle School in the city, Jining Normal School, and Girls' Middle School were quickly restored. Even pre-war schools that had collapsed during the Anti-Japanese War, such as Juancheng Normal School, Yuncheng Normal School, Ningyang Middle School, Shouzhang Normal School, Yanggu Middle School, and Qingfeng Normal School, were re-established by the democratic government at this time. Many of the original teachers from these schools, as well as intellectuals who had lived in seclusion in the countryside during the Anti-Japanese War, participated in the educational work of the new schools. In Taihang, after our army liberated Xingtai, Jiaozuo, Boai, and other places, the majority of the original teachers from the local secondary schools remained in their original schools to teach, and the number of new students who had just been liberated from the long-term rule of the enemy reached 1,019 in 1945. The situation in other areas was generally the same.

　　During the intense two years of the People's Liberation War, secondary schools in North China persisted in their work under various difficult conditions, training 36,168 students. These are the achievements of the efforts of educational workers and are worthy of commendation. However, due to changes in the situation, unclear leadership guidelines, lack of systems and plans, and failure to establish certain systems in a timely manner, secondary education could not fully adapt to the needs of the war and construction. In addition, during the land reform and party rectification, the mistake of transplanting the methods of rural struggle to schools once created a state of chaos in the schools. These greatly affected the due achievements of secondary education. In particular, last winter, many teachers and students suffered undue blows and purges simply because of their family background or certain shortcomings in their style of work. This was a serious loss. This error has begun to be corrected in some areas since this spring. The situation has now changed. Taiyue wrote letters to the purged teachers and students, and Jizhong assigned special personnel to go down to correct the errors. Other regions have all carried out deviations, and considerable results have been achieved. The purged teachers and students have gradually returned to school, and most of those who have not returned have also participated in work. Since the beginning of summer, various regions have convened middle school conferences to study educational guidelines, correct educational policies, and continue to implement deviation corrections. Middle schools in various places are showing a new atmosphere. In Jinnan, there were only more than 800 students in six middle schools this spring, but after correcting deviations, the number has now increased to 1,548.

　　This North China Secondary Education Conference has further clearly defined the future direction of secondary education, formulated school systems and courses, unified thinking, and the secondary education cause in the North China Liberated Area will surely make brilliant achievements on the existing basis.

　　发展中的华北中等教育
    华北解放区的教育事业，从抗日战争时期，就在不断建设并有许多创造，三年以来，更有蓬勃的发展。据最近各地不完全的统计，散布在华北解放区各地的中等学校，有一四四处：其中行署与市县立中学四十三处，行署与市立师范五处，县立简师九○处，其他职业学校如财经学校等六处。经常在校学习的学生，有二四九六二名。计：中学生一五五○六人，占全部学生二分之一强。师范生七一二八人，职业学校学生二三二八人。这些学校在各行署市分布的情形如下：太行区共二十九处。行署立中学六处，师范二处，财经学校一处，县立简师二○处。学生共三二八四人。冀南区共二十七处。行署立中学六处，职业学校（农校，财经学校及电话训练学校）三处，县立简师十八处。学生共三二六三人（缺八个县师统计）。冀中区共二十五处。行署立中学五处，专署与县立简师中学二○处，此外有些县立高小尚附设有中学班。共有学生六三六九人。北岳区共二十二处，行署立中学七处，师范一处，县立简师十四处。学生共三一二七人。冀鲁豫区共十九处。行署立中学五处，县立简师十四处。学生共三四○七人。太岳区共十八处。行署立中学六处，师范一处，政民干校一处，县立简师中学十处。学生共三六三七人。石庄市共四处：市立中学，市立女中，市立师范，建设学院。学生共一八七五人。此外，华北中央局与华北政府所直属的有育才中学一处，学生四五○人，及职工学校、财经学校、会计学校、妇婴卫生学校等。
    约三年的时间，华北解放区的中等学校，比抗日战争时期骤增了四倍。据日寇投降前的统计：那时全华北区共有中等学校三十四处，原晋冀鲁豫二十六处，晋察冀八处，学生六三五九人。这在抗日时期艰苦的游击战争环境里，成绩实属惊人。日寇投降的后半年与第二年上半年，中等学校即飞速地向前发展。晋察冀区中学由八处增加到四十三处，学生由一六五五人增加到六千余人。至张家口撤退前，又发展到五十六处，学生一○三五○人。晋冀鲁豫区学校也由廿六处增加到五○处。由于各地学生大批涌进学校，各校学生班次，都普遍增加。如太行四六年上半年，即由过去的九处中学，三十五个班，一三○九学生，迅速增到十四处中学，六十一个班，二六七四学生。到四六年底，又增至七十一班，三五○○学生。四七年，为了满足各地国民教育普遍发展所引起的师资要求，太行各县又设立了二○个简师，共三十七个班，受训师资一四八○人。其他如冀南、太岳、冀鲁豫等地，中等学校，短期也获得迅速发展。
    日寇投降以后，华北解放区中等学校如此蓬勃发展，一方面是由于各地教育工作者适应新的形势。全力扩大和创设新校，另一方面，则由于我们在新收复城市，正确执行了对知识分子的政策，把接收过来的学校，迅速恢复的原故。如晋察冀收复张家口及其他城市后，中学即迅速开学。晋冀鲁豫在收复济宁后，市内第七中学，济宁师范，女子中学等校，都迅速恢复，连抗日战争中垮台的战前学校，如鄄城师范、郓城师范、宁阳中学、寿张师范、阳谷中学、清丰师范学校，也都在这时被民主政府重新建立起来。这些学校的原有教员，及抗日期间隐居乡间的知识分子，不少参加了新学校的教育工作。在太行我军解放邢台、焦作、博爱等地后，当地中等学校的原有教员，绝大部分仍留原校教书，刚从敌人长期统治下解放出来的新生入学，在四五年即达一○一九人。其他地区情形，大体相同。
    在人民解放战争的紧张的两年多中间，华北中等学校在各种困难条件下，坚持了工作，培养了三六一六八个学生，这些都是教育工作者努力的成绩，是值得表扬的。但是由于形势的变化，领导上方针不明确，无制度，无计划，没有及时建立一定制度，致使中学教育不能完全适应战争和建设的需要。又加以在土改与整党中，错误地把农村斗争的一套搬运到学校来，曾经一时地造成学校的混乱状态。这些都大大影响了中等教育应有的成绩。特别是去年冬季，许多教员和学生，仅仅因为家庭出身的关系或某些作风上的缺点，受到了不应有的打击和清洗。这是一个严重的损失。这种错误，今春以来，部分地区即已开始纠正。现在情况已经改变过来。太岳给被清洗的教职员学生写信，冀中指派专人下去纠正。其他各区都进行了纠偏，并获得相当的成效。被清洗的教职员学生，逐渐回校，没有回校的也大部分参加了工作。入夏以后，各区召开了中学会议，研究了教育方针，端正了教育政策，继续贯彻纠偏，各地中学又呈现着新的气象。冀南今春六处中学，只有八百多名学生，纠偏后，现在已增加到一五四八人。
    这次华北中等教育会议，更明确规定了今后中等教育方针，制订了学制课程、统一了思想，华北解放区中等教育事业，在已有的基础上，定量做出了灿烂的成绩。
