Criticism and Suggestions

　　Occupying City Housing Should Require Rent Payment
　　Editor:

　　(1) On the morning of September 5th, I heard from comrades registering houses in Xijie, Pingshan City, that private city housing occupied by public institutions for business purposes in the city is not paying rent. The most obvious example is the Xinhua Bookstore, which occupies seventeen rooms of Ruijihao's city housing and has never paid a penny in rent. Moreover, when they initially moved in, it was not genuinely with the homeowner's true consent, but they moved in anyway. This was personally told to me by the owner of Ruijihao. As a result, he has no intention of repairing the house that was damaged by rain this year. According to the New Democracy economic policy, rental relationships are allowed to exist under certain conditions, especially city housing rentals, which are not feudal in nature. If this continues, it will be harmful to the development of industry and commerce and social construction, and it violates the Party's policy.

　　(2) Gambling is rampant in Zhongjiabi Village, Pingshan, with frequent money games. Cadres are helpless in the face of it. Gambling is something done by hooligans and idlers, which not only hinders production and disrupts social order but also corrodes the masses' thinking and should be corrected immediately.

　　The above two suggestions, hope relevant departments will investigate and resolve them.

专栏：批评与建议

　　占用市房应出赁钱编辑同志：
    （一）九月五号上午，听平山城内西街登记房屋的同志谈，该城私人的市房被公家占居经商者，都不出赁钱。最显明的例子如新华书店，占领瑞记号的市房十七间，始终未给分毫赁钱。同时，在初居时，并非真得房主真心自愿，就搬进去了。这是该号亲自向我谈的。所以在今年被雨淋垮的房屋他至今无心修理。按新民主主义经济政策，是允许租赁关系在一定条件下存在的，尤其是市房的租赁，并非封建剥削性质，如果这样下去，对工商业的发展与社会建设是有害无益的，是违反党的政策的。
    （二）平山中贾壁村赌博风行，经常玩钱，干部见了束手无策。赌博是流氓懒汉所办的事，不仅妨碍生产，扰乱社会秩序，而且会腐蚀群众的思想，应即纠正。
    　牛登逵
    以上两个建议，希有关方面加以检查解决。
