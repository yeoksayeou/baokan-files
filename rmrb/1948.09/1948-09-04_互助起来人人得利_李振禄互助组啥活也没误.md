　　Mutual Aid Benefits Everyone
  　Li Zhenlu's Mutual Aid Group Never Misses a Thing
    [Taiyue Telegraph] Li Zhenlu, a poor peasant in Xiwuwu Village, Fifth District of Jicheng, discussed with five close neighbors in front of his house during the spring plowing season, saying, "Why don't we form a mutual aid group?" The five families agreed, and they elected Li Zhenlu as the leader. The families together had eight full laborers, one half-laborer, two cows, and 215 mu of land. They worked together, initially not keeping accounts, but just estimating in their minds, considering the work and labor to be equivalent. Just as they were sowing seeds, they happened to be called upon to join the battle in Linfen, and six full laborers from the group left at once, immediately causing a labor shortage. When the six who joined the battle left, they all felt that their family's production would be affected. Gu Chengxi said, "If everyone can help me, then help me, if you can't help, then let the weeds take over." Zhang Lianke also planted several ridges of tobacco seedlings and was afraid that if he was called away, no one would take care of them, and they would die of drought. Li Zhenlu understood everyone's concerns and led everyone to work harder, doing whoever's work was most urgent first, and doing whatever was most urgent first. He first calculated how many ridges of tobacco seedlings everyone in the group needed to plant and then concentrated their efforts to plant 150 ridges. This solved the problem of tobacco seedlings for everyone in the group at once. He also organized the half-laborer: the old man plowed the land, and the women and children sowed seeds, using this method to plant 28 mu of cotton, 10 mu of sesame, 7 mu of sorghum, and 20 mu of sweet potatoes and watermelons. The women in this village used to do nothing, and even grinding grain relied on men. This time they did so much work, and when the people who joined the battle came back, they saw that nothing had been missed in production and said with smiles, "This year, the mutual aid group is really useful." Zhang Zilai said, "If it weren't for the mutual aid group, the land would have been deserted when people went to war, and the cattle would have been idle in the stalls with no one to use them." Gu Chengxi said, "Knowing that our mutual aid group is like this, we can rest assured when we are called upon in the future." The good production performance of Li Zhenlu's mutual aid group influenced Zhang Mingxin, Li Mingchang, and others who were unwilling to participate in mutual aid, and they volunteered to join his mutual aid group. At the time of wheat harvesting, the whole group increased from five households to twelve households, and the number of livestock increased from two to five. In addition, seven women also wanted to join his mutual aid group. At this time, Li Zhenlu's mutual aid group took a step forward and decided to record work points based on the amount of work done. Zhou Lianhua, a woman, cut wheat the same as men, so she was given ten points. This method made everyone more willing to work hard. In four days, all 293 mu of wheat in the group were harvested. Their labor price was not fixed, but adjusted according to the season. Usually, every ten points of work were worth four jin of wheat, but during the wheat season, it became one dou. This was because at this time, everyone could pick up one dou of wheat a day, and if the labor price was not increased, everyone's enthusiasm would be reduced. Accounts were settled once a month, with surpluses and shortages being compensated, and no one owing anyone anything. Now all the group's wheat fields have been plowed two or three times. They plan to plow them again thoroughly so that by the time of wheat sowing, they will have been plowed five times. The autumn fields have been weeded twice and are starting to be weeded a third time. In the past, cotton was only hoed once, but this year it has been hoed four times. The last time there was a heavy rain, everyone proposed to plant a large number of vegetables to ensure that they would not have to buy vegetables in the fall. The group planted a total of three mu of red and white radishes, two mu of green onions, and one mu of mixed vegetables. After harvesting the vegetables, half of them will be sold, and the rest will be enough to eat. The group planted 20 mu of tobacco (which can yield 2,000 jin) and plans to build a tobacco-curing furnace to cure the tobacco leaves, making them easier to sell. They also plan that after plowing the wheat fields three times, the whole group will take time to transport coal once to prepare for curing the tobacco leaves. Everyone happily said, "This year, the mutual aid group has done the right thing. The fields have never been worked as well as they have been this year."

　　互助起来人人得利
  　李振禄互助组啥活也没误
    【太岳电】冀城五区西仵伍村贫农李振禄，在春耕时和门前五家亲邻商量说：“咱几家成立一个变工组吧。”当时这五家都很赞成，就推李振禄当组长。几家合起来共有八个全劳力，一个半劳力，两头牛，二百一十五亩地。他们在一块儿做活，起初不记帐，只是心里盘谋一下，活与活、工与工相等就算啦。正在下种时候，可巧碰到要上临汾参战，组里一下就走了六个全劳力，马上感到劳力困难。当参战的六个人走时，都觉着家里的生产要受影响，谷成喜说：“大家能帮助我做就做一做，不能帮助做，就叫草混去吧。”张连科又种几畦旱烟苗，也恐怕支差走了没人管，旱死了。李振禄摸透了大家的心思，就领导大家加紧作活，谁的活紧先给谁作；什么活紧先作什么。他把全组谁需要种多少畦旱烟苗先统计了一下，然后集中力量突击，种了一百五十畦。把全组人的烟苗问题一下就解决了。又把半劳力也组织起来：老汉犁地，妇女儿童溜籽，用这种方法种了二十八亩棉花，十亩芝麻，七亩高粱，二十亩红薯和西瓜。这村妇女过去啥活也不干，连推磨都靠男人。这次干了这样多的活，参战人回来一看，啥生产都没有误，笑嘻嘻的说：“今年变工组可真管用啦。”张子来说：“如果不是变工组，人去参战，地也荒啦，牛在槽上闲着，也没人使。”谷成喜说：“知道咱变工组有这个样儿，以后支差就放心啦。”李振禄变工组生产成绩好，把不愿互助的张鸣信、李鸣昌等影响得也自愿报名参加了他的变工组。收麦时，全组由五户增加到十二户，牲口由两头增加到五头。另外还有七个妇女也要参加他的变工组。这时李振禄的变工组向前发展了一步，决定按做活多少记工，妇女周莲花割麦和男人一样，就给记十分。这样干法，更使大家愿意出力。四天工夫就将全组二百九十三亩麦子全部割完了。他们的工价不定死，按季节走。平时每十分工四市斤麦子，到麦时就成了一斗。因为这时每人一天可拾一斗麦子，工价如不提高，大家情绪就要降低。一月结算一次帐，长支短补，互不欠帐。现在全组麦地都犁过两遍、三遍。计划还用翻犁大翻一遍，到种麦时要犁够五遍。秋地都锄过两遍，已开始锄三遍了。棉花往年只是刀一下，今年全锄过四遍。前次下透雨，大家提出要大量种菜，保证秋后不买菜吃。全组共种了红白萝卜三亩，葱二亩，杂菜一亩。收了菜，卖上一半，剩下的还可够吃。组里种的二十亩烟（能收两千斤），计划盖一座薰烟炉，把烟叶薰一薰，容易卖钱，又计划翻过三遍麦地后，全组再抽空运一次煤炭，以备薰烟叶时用。大家都高兴的说：“今年互助组可搞对啦，这几年的地里都没有今年做的好。
