　　Overcome Self-Flow, Strengthen Wheat Planting Leadership
    Autumn Equinox has passed, and the wheat planting season is fast approaching. In areas where wheat has not yet been planted, efforts should be intensified to plant wheat and expand wheat fields immediately. In areas where wheat has already been planted, leaders should conduct thorough inspections, seize the time to resolve various difficulties faced by the masses, and strive to complete planting entirely, laying the foundation for next year's large-scale production campaign.

    Based on incomplete materials currently available, the wheat planting movement is extremely uneven. In areas such as Taiyue, Taihang, and Central Hebei, the district party committees and administrative offices have issued general calls and provided specific guidance. In many places, they have publicized our party's land policy and the basic situation of "Ending Land Reform" during production leadership, and proposed the slogan of determining land ownership. Some villages have even issued land certificates, which have played a significant role in stabilizing people's hearts and minds and preparing for the successful completion of land reform. In many areas of Taihang and Taiyue, through the leadership of the party branch, the masses have been organized to plant wheat, accumulate fertilizer, and harvest autumn crops. This has established the leadership authority of the party branch among the masses, eliminated the concerns of some party members who "fear being criticized," and laid a victorious foundation for the upcoming party rectification work. Under these circumstances, in areas where leadership has been good, deep plowing, sufficient fertilizer application, expansion of wheat fields, and selection of superior varieties have generally been achieved. Furthermore, the production enthusiasm of all strata has been encouraged during the wheat harvest, and the organizations of the party and the masses have been strengthened and consolidated.

    It is important to note that there are still some areas where the tendency to neglect leadership over autumn harvesting and planting persists seriously. Many ideological concerns and practical difficulties of the masses have not been properly resolved. This should be given high attention by the leadership in various places.

    This is specifically manifested in the following aspects:

    First, it violates the basic spirit of "paying attention to the season" in the 1948 CPC Central Committee's instructions on land reform and party rectification work. It has failed to focus primary efforts on leading autumn harvesting and planting, simply emphasizing land reform and party rectification. No specific investigations have been conducted on autumn planting, nor have there been any special discussions. Some have simply copied the instructions and calls from above, while others have devoted all their efforts to running training classes and holding village cadre meetings, completely ignoring the major work of autumn harvesting and planting. Some places have only paid attention to "seizing the time to end land reform," thinking that the common people would take care of autumn harvesting and planting themselves. As a result, leadership was abandoned, and the largest number of current demands and highest interests of the masses were neglected, which will actually add great difficulties to future work.

    Second, the work style of dogmatism and bureaucratism of cadres is at play. Many cadres have the view that "it is easier to make progress by doing land reform and party rectification, and it is not easy to make progress by leading production," and that "first-class cadres are engaged in land reform, and second-class cadres are engaged in production." They underestimate the leadership of production, failing to recognize that leading production is a long-term construction task, and only regard it as a statistical number (such as how many mutual aid organizations have been formed, how many people have been affected by disasters, etc.) or a simple technical work that is "always the same every year." This thinking is very common and has a great impact. It is manifested in the work style of leading production as serious bureaucratism. In many areas, cadres go to the countryside not to go deep into the masses to discover problems, solve problems, and promote production, but to ask village cadres for information, fill in forms with numbers, or hold unprepared and lengthy mass meetings or cadre meetings, exhausting everyone and affecting production. The production arrangements for each village are generalized: empty talk about "party members taking the lead and the role of backbones" without solving specific problems. In some places in Anguo, the phenomenon of "the top calls, and the bottom sleeps" has occurred. Taihang criticized this work style as a "purely task-oriented viewpoint," detached from the masses and a tired old form of formalism, which will result in the failure of autumn harvesting and planting, which is critical to the success or failure of next year's large-scale production movement.

    Third, some places lack specific and effective methods for resolving the ideological concerns of party members and the masses. "Party members are afraid of being criticized," thinking that it is better to do less than more, and dare not actively lead the masses in production. The masses are afraid of "equal distribution" and afraid of "not being able to keep it." As far as we know, many local party committees attach importance to this issue. The Taihang District clearly stated that the main task in the future is production, and the main content of ending land reform is to carry out a small amount of land adjustment in conjunction with correcting deviations. Central Hebei and other places have repeatedly publicized the slogan of "whoever plants it, harvests it." Some counties in Taiyue have convened meetings of party members and labor heroes to dispel ideological concerns and promote mass production. Many places have expressed to the masses that "land reform has basically been completed, and land ownership will be determined in the future," and all these measures have played a very good role in stabilizing people's hearts and minds. However, it is rare to see specific analysis of the ideological conditions of various strata in the villages, and the identification and resolution of specific problems that currently exist based on the specific conditions of each place. In some places in Central Hebei, explaining policies to the masses through typical figures and facts is one method. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Party Committee has adopted the method of conducting in-depth investigations of one or two villages to help party committees at all levels concretely understand the central government's policies for old and semi-old areas, and ideologically resolve the understanding of the degree of completion of land reform. This method is also better for mass propaganda. Today, the biggest weakness in our propaganda work is that we only put forward general slogans to the masses, without linking them to specific facts that the masses are most familiar with and concerned about. The masses do not feel close to it, and they are half-convinced, affecting their enthusiasm for wheat planting.

    Fourth, attention should be paid to solving some specific difficulties of the masses in a timely manner. This is manifested differently in various regions. In the saw-toothed region of Henan in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the masses' large numbers of livestock and strong laborers were robbed by the enemy, making them unable to plant wheat. Although this issue has been reported, no active measures have been seen to solve it specifically. The biggest difficulty for the masses in various disaster-stricken areas is the lack of seeds. This newspaper has repeatedly received appeals from readers in Central Hebei and Southern Hebei requesting seed loans and exchanges. We hope that various places will conduct further inspections. Mobilizing the masses in Central Hebei to boil saltpeter to exchange for wheat seeds, and the Shouyang Democratic Government's timely allocation of 520 stones of wheat to adjust seeds, are examples worth emulating. Conversely, there are still many areas that only put forward the empty slogan of "social mutual assistance" without conducting in-depth investigations to come up with various specific methods, which only delays the wheat planting season. In the support-the-front areas, the young and strong have gone to the front line. It is also important to note that labor should be organized rationally and production should be arranged properly, so that the land of wartime laborers and military martyrs' families is not "wronged." In addition, there are those who are unwilling to plant wheat due to excessive burdens last year, and those who are unable to drain water due to flooding, which affects wheat planting. These must be carefully and seriously resolved.

    Time is extremely urgent. All rapid and effective methods must be adopted to check the wheat planting situation in various places, commend the good, criticize the bad, and not be satisfied with various figures and reports, but go deep into the masses to conduct serious inspections. The Ninth Prefectural Committee of Central Hebei has already started this inspection work. At the same time, the leadership should earnestly give cadres specific help, so that they truly understand the party's policies, the working principles in various regions, and the basic situation of land reform in the local area, and make them clear about the serious significance of industrial and agricultural production in the long-term construction of North China in the future, and tell them that the ideological deviations of the peasant class can be corrected with correct publicity and explanation, and the various concerns of the masses will not find a way to express. All of this depends on: "Strengthening wheat planting guidance."

### 克服自流，加强种麦领导

　　克服自流，加强种麦领导
    秋分已过，种麦季节眼看就要过了，未种上的地区要立即加紧种麦扩大麦田，已种上的地区领导上则应深入检查，抓紧时间解决群众各方面困难，不失时机的争取全部种上，打下明年大生产运动基础。
    依据目前不完整的材料看，种麦运动表现为极不平衡，在太岳、太行、冀中等地，区党委行署均做了普遍号召并进行了具体指导，许多地方在领导生产中宣传了我党土地政策和“结束土改”的基本情况，提出了确定地权的口号；有些村子还发了土地证，这在安定人心和准备顺利完成结束土改工作上都起了极大的作用。太行、太岳许多地区通过支部领导群众种麦积肥收秋，树立了支部在群众中的领导威信，消除了某些党员“怕挨整”的疑虑，给即将到来的整党工作打下了胜利的基础。在这样情况下，凡是领导得好的地区，一般地均做到犁深粪饱，扩大了麦田，选了优良品种，并在麦收中鼓舞了各阶层生产情绪，健全和巩固了党和群众的组织。
    值得我们注意的是：仍有若干地区至今仍然严重的存在着忽视领导秋收秋种的偏向，群众的许多思想顾虑和实际困难都还没有得到适当的解决。应引起各地领导上高度注意。
    这具体的表现在以下几个方面：
    第一、是违背了一九四八年中共中央土改工作和整党工作指示中“必须注意季节”的基本精神，没有把主要力量放在领导秋收秋耕，只是单纯的着重了土改和整党，对秋耕秋种既未做具体调查，也没做专门讨论，有的把上边的指示号召照抄一遍，有的则以全部力量忙于开训练班，开村干会议，对于秋收秋耕的重大工作根本没有理睬，有的地方只注意了“争取时间，结束土改”，以为秋收秋耕老百姓自己会搞，结果放弃领导，脱离群众当前的最大多数要求和最高利益，实际上将要给今后工作增加极大困难。
    第二、干部的经验主义官僚主义作风在作怪。不少干部有这样一个看法：“做土改整党容易进步，领导生产不容易进步”，“头等干部搞土改，次的干部搞生产”，轻视领导生产，不认识领导生产是长期的建设工作，只把它看作统计数目字（如互助组织了多少，受灾人口多少等）或是“年年总是这么一套”的单纯的技术工作。这种思想非常普遍，影响也很大，表现在领导生产的作风上便是严重的官僚主义。不少地区干部下乡不是深入群众中去发现问题解决问题推动生产，而是向村干要情况，要数字填表，或是开无准备的漫长的群众会或干部会，弄的大家精疲力竭，影响生产。对各村生产布置是一般化的：空谈什么“党员带头，骨干作用”，不解决具体问题。安国有些地方就发生了“上边号召，下边睡觉”的现象。太行批评这种作风为“单纯任务观点”，脱离群众，形式主义老一套，其结果会使关系明年大生产运动成败的秋收秋耕工作落空。
    第三、有些地方对解决党员和群众的思想顾虑缺乏具体有效的方法，“党员怕挨整”，认为多一事不如少一事，不敢积极领导群众生产，群众怕“平分”，怕“落不住”。据我们所知很多地方党委是重视了这一问题，太行区明确提出今后主要任务是生产，结束土改工作的主要内容是结合纠偏进行小部分之土地调剂，冀中等地一再宣传“谁种谁收”的口号，太岳有些县召集党员、劳动英雄会议，解除思想顾虑并推动群众生产。许多地方都向群众表示“土改基本上完成，今后要确定地权”等，这一切措施都起了很好地安定人心的作用。但如何在村里具体分析各阶层的思想状况，依据各地具体条件，找出现在存在的具体问题加以解决，还很少见。冀中有些地方通过典型的人物及事实去向群众解释政策是一种方法。冀鲁豫区党委采取深入调查一二村庄情况，帮助各级党委具体认识中央对老区半老区政策，从思想上解决对土改完成程度的认识，这种方法对群众宣传同样也较好。今天我们宣传工作最大的弱点是只向群众提一般的口号，而没有把它同具体的群众最熟悉最关切的事实连系起来，群众听了不亲切，以致半信半疑，影响了种麦的积极性。
    第四、群众有些具体困难应注意及时解决，这在各种不同地区各有不同的表现；冀鲁豫河南拉锯地区，群众大批牲口和壮丁被敌人抢走，以致无力种麦，这一问题虽有报导，但如何具体解决尚未见有积极措施，各地受灾区群众最大困难是缺乏种子，本报曾一再接到冀中、冀南读者呼吁，要求贷种换种，希望各地再作检查。象冀中动员群众熬硝换麦种，寿阳民主政府及时拨麦五百二十石调剂种子，都是一些值得仿效的例子。相反的还有不少地区只提出“社会互济”的空洞口号，而不做深入调查想出各种具体办法，结果只有耽搁了种麦季节。在支前地区青壮走上前线，合理的组织劳力安排生产，而不让打战民工及军干烈属土地“背屈”，也是值得注意的一个问题。此外还有是因去年负担过重而不愿种麦的，也有因被水淹无力排水而影响种麦的。这些均要细密的认真的求得解决。
    时间异常紧迫，必须采取一切迅速而有效的方法检查各地种麦情形，表扬好的，批评坏的，不要满足于各种数目字及报告，而要深入到群众中去认真检查。冀中九地委已经开始了这一检查工作。同时领导上应认真给干部以具体帮助，使他们真正了解党的政策，各种不同地区工作方针，了解当地土改的基本状况，使他们明确在工农业生产在今后华北长期建设工作中的严重意义，告诉他们以正确的宣传解释农民阶级的思想偏向端正了，群众的各种疑虑便始终找不到门径。而所有这一切都依靠于：“加强种麦指导”。
