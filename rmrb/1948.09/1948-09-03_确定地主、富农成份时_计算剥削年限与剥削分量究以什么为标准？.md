　　When determining the class status of landlords and rich peasants,
  　What standards should be used for calculating the years and amount of exploitation?
    Question: We have encountered two problems in reviewing class status that we cannot resolve. One is the number of years of exploitation by landlords and rich peasants, and the other is the amount of exploitation by rich peasants. Regarding the former, the 1933 document stipulated that the calculation should start from the establishment of the revolutionary regime, counting backward. Anyone who continuously lived as a landlord or rich peasant for three years would be classified as a landlord or rich peasant. However, Comrade Ren Bishi's report stipulated that in the old liberated areas, landlords who had engaged in labor for five consecutive years after the establishment of the democratic regime, and rich peasants who had not exploited others for three consecutive years, could change their class status. Regarding the latter, the 1933 document stipulated that "those whose exploitation exceeds 15 percent of their family's total annual income are called rich peasants." However, Comrade Ren Bishi's report stipulated that their exploitation income must exceed 25 percent of their income to be considered rich peasants. Which document should be followed in the old liberated areas regarding the above two issues? Also, how should the amount of exploitation by rich peasants be specifically calculated? Should the food and wages of hired laborers be deducted from their total income?
    Answer: Regarding the question of "which document should be followed," when the Central Committee re-promulgated the two 1933 documents this year, it also issued the "Decision on the Two 1933 Documents," which was printed in front of the two documents. It clearly pointed out: "Issues not mentioned in these two documents, and issues concerning the division between rich peasants and middle peasants, should be based on other documents published by the Central Committee and Comrade Ren Bishi's speech 'Several Issues in Land Reform' made on January 12, 1948." The 1933 document, supplemented in this way, is the correct standard for classifying classes.
    Regarding the number of years of exploitation. The 1933 decision stipulated that the calculation should start from the establishment of the revolutionary regime, counting backward for three consecutive years, as the time standard for classifying class status. This is the time standard for determining whether someone was a landlord or rich peasant at the time of the establishment of the revolutionary regime. Comrade Bishi's report stated that landlords who have worked for five years and rich peasants who have eliminated exploitation for three years under the democratic regime should change their class status. This is based on the 1933 decision. When the revolutionary regime was established, they were originally landlords and rich peasants, but under the democratic regime, due to the implementation of our party's policies such as reasonable burden, rent reduction, and interest reduction, or for other reasons, they have descended to the level of peasants. Those who have been landlords for five years and rich peasants for three years should have their class status changed. These two regulations are not contradictory. The 1933 decision stipulates the number of years for constituting class status, and Comrade Bishi's report stipulates the number of years for changing class status. The latter is a supplement to the former. Suppose the revolutionary regime was established in early 1938. If someone continuously lived as a landlord in 1935, 1936, and 1937, or their annual exploitation income exceeded 25 percent of their total income (the 15 percent stipulated in 1933 was changed to 25 percent according to Comrade Bishi's report), then this person has constituted landlord or rich peasant status. However, if this person has been engaged in labor himself and no longer exploited others for five years since 1938, regardless of when he started, he should be changed from a landlord to a peasant. Or, if this person was originally an old-style rich peasant, if he has eliminated his exploitation for three years, he should be changed from a rich peasant to a peasant.
    Regarding the amount of exploitation. The boundary between rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants should be uniformly determined according to Comrade Bishi's report, using 25 percent as the dividing line. As for the calculation method of the amount of exploitation by farmers who hire farm laborers, it is to deduct wages and food (no other deductions) from the products of the hired laborers, and see if the surplus exceeds 25 percent of the employer's total income. If it exceeds, it is a rich peasant; if it does not exceed (or is exactly equal to), it is a well-to-do middle peasant. Suppose a farmer works himself and also hires people to work, and his total annual income is 100 shi. Suppose the hired laborer's products are 60 shi, and the hired laborer's wages and food amount to 30 shi. Subtracting 30 shi from 60 shi leaves 30 shi, which exceeds 25 percent of his total income of 100 shi. This farmer should be classified as a rich peasant. In the above example, if the total income is 100 shi, if the hired laborer's products are 50 shi, and the hired laborer's wages and food amount to 25 shi or more than 25 shi. Subtracting 25 shi or more than 25 shi from 50 shi leaves 25 shi or less than 25 shi, which only accounts for 25 percent or less of his total income of 100 shi. This farmer should be classified as a well-to-do middle peasant.

### 确定地主、富农成份时　计算剥削年限与剥削分量究以什么为标准？

　　确定地主、富农成份时
  　计算剥削年限与剥削分量究以什么为标准？
    问：我们在审订成份中，遇到两个问题不能解决，一个是地主、富农的剥削年限问题，一个是富农的剥削分量问题。关于前一问题，一九三三年文件中规定以革命政权建立时为起点，向上推算，凡连续过地主、富农生活满三年者即构成地主、富农成份；而任弼时同志报告中则规定在老解放区内，民主政权建立后，地主劳动连续满五年、富农不剥削连续满三年者即可改变成份。关于后一问题，一九三三年文件中规定“其剥削分量超过其全家一年总收入的百分之十五者，叫做富农。”而任弼时同志报告中，则规定其剥削收入要超过其收入百分之廿五者才算富农。以上两个问题，在老解放区究应依从那个文件？又富农的剥削分量，怎样具体计算？是否应从其总收入中扣除雇工的伙食、工资？
    答：关于“究应依从哪个文件”的问题，今年中央重新公布一九三三年两个文件时，并发表了“关于一九三三年的两个文件的决定”，印在两个文件前面，其中即曾明白指出：“这两个文件中没有讲到的问题及关于富农和中农分界的问题，则应以中央发表的其他文件及任弼时同志在一九四八年一月十二日所作‘土地改革中的几个问题’的讲演中所说者为准。”加上这样补充以后的一九三三年文件，就是划分阶级的正确标准。
    关于剥削年限问题。一九三三年的决定，规定以革命政权成立时为起点，向上推算，连续三年做为划分阶级的时间标准，这是确定某人在革命政权成立时是否地主或富农成份的时间标准；弼时同志报告中说，在民主政权下地主劳动五年、富农取消剥削三年者改变其成份，这是根据三三年决定，当革命政权建立时，原是地主富农，但在民主政权上，由于我党历年来合理负担、减租减息等政策之执行或其他原因而下降为农民，地主满五年，富农满三年者，即应改变其成份。这两个规定并无矛盾，三三年决定规定的为构成成份的年限，弼时同志报告中规定的是改变成份的年限，后者正是前者的补充。假定革命政权成立于一九三八年初，某人在一九三五、三六、三七三年，连续过地主生活或每年的剥削收入均超过其总收入百分之二十五（三三年规定的百分之十五，照弼时同志报告改为二十五），则此人已构成地主或富农成份；但如此人自一九三八年以后，无论从何年起自己从事劳动，不再剥削别人已满五年者，即应由地主改为农民，或此人原为旧式富农，如取消其剥削已满三年者，即应由富农改为农民。
    关于剥削分量问题。应一律依照弼时同志的报告，以百分之廿五为富农与富裕中农的界限。至于对雇用雇农的农民之剥削分量的计算方法，则是从雇农的生产物中扣除工资和食粮（其余不扣），看其盈余是否超过此雇主的总收入的百分之二十五，如超过则为富农，不超过（或刚好等于）则为富裕中农。假定某农民自己劳动，也雇人劳动，全年总收入是一百石，假定雇农的生产物是六十石，雇农的工资、伙食合三十石，从六十石中减去三十石，尚余三十石，超过其总收入一百石的百分之二十五，此农民应定为富农。如上例，总收入为一百石，若雇农生产物为五十石，雇农的工资、伙食合二十五石或比二十五石还多，从五十石中减去二十五石或二十五石多，尚余二十五石或不到二十五石，仅占其总收入一百石的百分之二十五或不足二十五，此农民应定为富裕中农。
