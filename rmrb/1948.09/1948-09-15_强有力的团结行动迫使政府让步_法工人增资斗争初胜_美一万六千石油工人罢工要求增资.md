　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: TASS reports: The French General Confederation of Labor issued a public statement on the 6th, pointing out that the French working class's strong and united action has forced the government to make concessions, agreeing to issue workers an August subsidy of 2,500 francs (workers originally demanded 3,000 francs). The statement suggested that the General Confederation of Agricultural Workers should demand the same subsidy for its workers, and expressed that the General Confederation of Labor would support all activities of government employees to obtain subsidies. Finally, the statement emphasized that the political agreement to issue this subsidy is an attempt to avoid resolving the entire wage issue. Workers should not be satisfied with obtaining this subsidy, but should unite to realize the basic demands of the working class. According to the Associated Press, General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, Frachon, said in a speech on the night of the 6th that obtaining the subsidy was the first victory in the working class's struggle for wage increases, but French workers will continue to fight to raise the minimum wage from 10,900 francs to 13,500 francs per month.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: US Labor Briefs: (1) The strike of nearly 30,000 dockworkers, which has paralyzed shipping operations at various Pacific ports in the United States, continues. The loss to coastal commerce is estimated at $4 million per day. The US Department of the Army, fearing that the strike will affect the transportation of military supplies to the Far East, is preparing to intervene in the strike. (2) The strike of 10,000 truck drivers in New York City has spread to neighboring Newark, where 4,300 drivers joined the strike on the 5th, which will lead to a food crisis in New York City. (3) 16,000 oil workers in California, affiliated with the CIO, went on strike on the 4th after the employers refused to increase wages. This strike has closed nine major refineries and will cause an oil panic in the western states.

　　强有力的团结行动迫使政府让步
  　法工人增资斗争初胜
    美一万六千石油工人罢工要求增资
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社报导：法国总工会于六日发表公报，指出法国工人阶级的强有力的联合行动已迫使政府让步，同意发给工人八月份补助费二千五百法郎（工人所要求者原为三千法郎）。公报建议农业工人总工会应为其工人要求同样的补助费，同时表示总工会将支持政府雇员要求获得补助费的一切活动。最后，公报强调指出，政治同意发给这项补助费的目的，是在企图逃避解决整个工资问题。工人们不应以得到这项补助费为满足，而应团结一致以实现工人阶级的基本要求。又据美联社消息，总工会总书记佛拉商于六日夜发表谈话称，补助费的获得，是工人阶级增资斗争的第一个胜利，但法国工人将继续为争取最低工资自每月一万零九百法郎提高至一万三千五百法郎而斗争。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】美国职工简讯：（一）使美国太平洋各港口航运工作陷于瘫痪的近三万的码头工人罢工，迄今仍在坚持中。海岸商业的损失，估计每日将达四百万美元。美陆军部由于害怕罢工将影响远东军用物资运输，已准备出面干预罢工。（二）纽约市一万卡车司机的罢工已波及其邻近的纽瓦克城，该城四千三百名司机，已于五日参加罢工，纽约市将因此而发生粮食的危机。（三）加利福尼亚州产联所属的一万六千石油工人，在资方拒绝增资要求后，亦于四日进入罢工。这一罢工已使九大炼油厂关门，并将引起西部各州的石油恐慌。
