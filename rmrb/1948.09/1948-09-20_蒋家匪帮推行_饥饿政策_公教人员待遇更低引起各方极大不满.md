Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 14th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the new salaries for public servants stipulated by the Kuomintang reactionary government after the "currency reform" have caused great dissatisfaction in all quarters. According to the new regulations, the salary standards for all public servants in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, taking the Shanghai area as an example, are uniformly based on 40 yuan of the original salary converted to the new "Gold Yuan" currency; 20 percent is paid for the portion exceeding 40 yuan up to 300 yuan. Other regions outside of Shanghai will increase or decrease by a certain percentage from this standard. Under this new standard, a public servant with a monthly salary of 100 yuan will actually only receive 52 yuan. At the same time, due to the abolition of the cost-of-living index, continued price increases, and the inevitable devaluation of the "Gold Yuan," their actual income will be far less than 52 yuan. Furthermore, public servants with a monthly salary of 100 yuan are in the minority; the suffering of the vast number of middle and lower-level public servants with monthly salaries below 100 yuan is even more unbearable. According to a Central News Agency report from Nanjing on August 29th, the professors' associations of national colleges and universities in Nanjing held a joint meeting on the 29th, attended by more than 20 professor representatives from universities such as Central University, Drama Academy, and Conservatory of Music. They unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with the new salary standard for public servants, pointing out that this treatment "is not only vastly different from pre-war treatment, but it is also difficult to maintain even a minimum standard of living." Even the pseudo-legislators generally "expressed dissatisfaction" with the "meager treatment" given to public servants this time, believing that "this treatment is less than 20 percent of the pre-war salaries of public servants" (Associated Press, Nanjing, August 28th). However, the ruthless Chiang Kai-shek, in his speech at the enlarged memorial week meeting in Nanjing on the 6th of this month, asked the public servants who were already starving to "grit their teeth and tighten their belts," and told them to "do the work of two people with one person, and eat the food of one person with two people" (Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th). This precisely exposes the essence of the "starvation policy" implemented by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique. Only the calculations of the rogue Chiang Kai-shek, who came from a stock exchange "scalper" background, could be so harsh and cruel.

　　蒋家匪帮推行“饥饿政策”
  　公教人员待遇更低引起各方极大不满
    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合各方消息：国民党反动政府于“币改”后所规定的公教人员的新待遇，已引起各方极大不满。按照新规定，国民党统治区一切公教人员的薪资标准，以京沪区为例，一律以原薪改订四十元为基数，实发伪金元券；超过四十元至三百元之部分，按百分之二十发给。京沪以外各地区，则以此标准分别增减若干成。在这新标准下，一个月薪一百元的公教人员，其实际收入只有五十二元，同时又因生活指数的取消，物价继续上涨和伪金元的必然贬值，其实际收入将远不足五十二元，且月薪一百元的公教人员乃属少数，其余月薪一百元以下的广大中下级公教人员，其苦更不堪言。据中央社南京八月二十九日消息，南京国立各专科以上学校教授会，于二十九日召开联席会议，到有中大、剧专、音乐学院等各校教授代表二十多人，对于公教人员待遇新标准，一致表示不满，并指出这一待遇“不但与战前待遇相差极巨，即维持最低限度之生活亦属不易”。甚至伪立法委员们，也一般都对这次给予公教人员的“低微待遇”“表示不满”，认为“这一待遇，不及战前公教人员薪水的百分之二十”（合众社南京八月二十八日电）。但心狠手辣的蒋介石，却在本月六日南京扩大纪念周会讲话中，要求早已陷入饥饿中的公教人员“咬紧牙关，抽紧肚带”，并要他们“一个人做两个人的事，两个人吃一个人的饭”（中央社南京六日电）。这正是一语道破蒋介石反动集团所推行的“饥饿政策”的实质。这也只有交易所做“抢帽子”出身的流氓蒋介石的算盘，才能打得如此刻薄残忍。
