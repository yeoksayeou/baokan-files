Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: According to a dispatch from Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 27th: Members of the Japanese Communist Party and left-wing Socialist Party, along with labor union and farmer association leaders, held a meeting in Tokyo and decided to form a new organization called the Democratic National Front. The formation of this new organization has been under discussion for a long time, and it will be called the League for the Defense of Democracy. It is expected to serve as a united center for workers, farmers, merchants, and small business owners to fight against intensifying reactionary activities. All democratic political parties and mass organizations will be invited to participate.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Tokyo News: JCP Secretary-General Tokuda Kyuichi granted an exclusive interview to a Domei News Agency reporter on the 25th, and issued a statement regarding the establishment of a Japanese People's Front. Tokuda emphasized: "The current situation in Japan is favorable for the establishment of a broad People's Front representing workers, farmers, the middle class, and even small and medium-sized industrialists. This People's Front is the first goal of the Communist Party, and it will fight to defend national independence and democracy, civil rights, and the economic interests of the majority of the people." Based on the assassination attempt against him in July by reactionaries and the anti-strike actions, Tokuda profoundly analyzed the current situation in Japan, stating: "The Japanese ruling class can no longer rule within the scope of bourgeois democracy and has adopted reactionary policies characterized by force and violence. The government's action of using MacArthur's letter to Ashida to deprive 2.5 million government employees of the right to collective bargaining and strike is the first step in a general offensive against the organization of the working class. The government is pinning its hopes on obtaining American capital. The situation of Japanese capitalism is so desperate that it cannot rule for long without foreign capital." Tokuda declared: The Communist Party will participate in organizing a national committee system representing various groups (political parties, trade unions, farmer associations, and other organizations) whose interests depend on freedom and national independence. In analyzing the favorable conditions for establishing a People's Front, Tokuda particularly emphasized the living conditions of Japanese workers and farmers, saying: Japanese workers today earn only about half of their living expenses, and the threat of unemployment hangs over their heads. Due to the government's increased grain collection and low official grain prices, poor and middle peasants are experiencing great difficulties. The serious shortage of agricultural capital can be illustrated by the fact that farmers' savings have decreased from 35 billion yen to 10 billion yen last year. A large number of small industrial enterprises are in danger of bankruptcy or being annexed by monopoly capital, and they have recently formed their own organizations to fight for survival.

　　日共及工农领袖等集会东京
  　决定组织民主阵线
  　德田发表谈话指出人民有利条件
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据电通社东京二十七日消息：日本共产党及左翼社会党议员与工会及农会领袖们在东京举行会议，决定组成一个民主民族阵线的新组织。这个新组织的组成已经讨论了很久，它将称为保卫民主同盟，预料将作为工人、农民、商人和小企业家对加厉中的反动活动进行斗争的团结中心。一切民主政党和群众团体均将被邀请参加。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】东京消息：日共总书记德田球一于二十五日单独接见电通社记者，发表关于建立日本人民阵线的谈话。德田着重指出：“目前日本情势，有利于建立代表工人、农民、中产阶级，甚至中小工业家的广泛的人民阵线。这一人民阵线是共产党的第一个目标，它将为保卫国家独立民主、公民权利以及大多数人民的经济利益而战斗”。德田根据七月间反动派对他的行刺和反罢工的行为，深刻地分析目前日本情势称：“日本统治阶级已再不能在资产阶级民主的范围内进行统治，而采取了以武力及暴力为其特征的反动政策。政府利用麦克阿瑟致芦田的信，剥夺二百五十万政府职工集体议价与罢工权利的行动，是对工人阶级的组织实行总进攻的第一步。政府正将其希望寄托于获得美国资本。日本资本主义的处境是如此绝望，以致没有外国资本就不能统治多久了”。德田宣称：共产党将参与组织代表各团体（政党、职工会、农会及其他组织）的全国性的委员会系统，这些团体的利益依赖于自由及国家独立。德田在分析建立人民阵线的有利条件时，特别重视日本工农的生活状况，他说：日本工人今天所得工资仅约达生活费用的半数，失业的威胁悬在他们的头顶上。由于政府增加粮食征收和粮食官价过低，贫农与中农正经历着巨大的困难。农业资本的严重短缺，可以拿农民的储蓄在去年中由三百五十亿日元降低到一百亿日元一事来说明。大量的小工业企业都处在破产或被独占资本并吞的危险之中，他们最近组成了他们自己的组织，来进行求生存的奋斗。
