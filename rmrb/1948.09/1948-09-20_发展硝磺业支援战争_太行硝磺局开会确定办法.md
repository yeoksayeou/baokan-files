Taihang Telegram: In order to better organize the masses for production and support the war, the Taihang Saltpeter and Sulphur Administration Bureau held a meeting of branch and county bureau chiefs in mid-August to summarize the achievements of saltpeter and sulphur work over the past year. Thanks to the strong assistance of party, government, and military leaders at all levels in the region, and the masses' practical experience of the benefits of the saltpeter and sulphur industry, the saltpeter and sulphur industry has developed rapidly. The number of saltpeter producing areas has increased from 15 counties in four special districts to 37 counties in six special districts. The quantity of saltpeter produced has almost doubled compared to last year, and the quality of saltpeter has also improved significantly. After 14 days of discussion, the meeting determined the future direction and specific methods of saltpeter and sulphur production: (1) Organize labor for saltpeter and sulphur production, quickly correct the past "leftist" errors that caused losses to saltpeter and sulphur production, and compensate saltpeter operators who were wrongly struggled against to restore their production. In the old areas, the focus is on consolidating and restoring saltpeter and sulphur work, improving technology, increasing production, and ensuring quality. In the new areas, the focus is on developing mass saltpeter production, training technical personnel, and gradually improving quantity and quality. (2) According to the different conditions in different regions, production can be organized in roughly three ways: partnership, mutual aid, and independent operation. In practice, these are small workshops and household sideline businesses. Regardless of the form of organization, the three principles of voluntariness, equivalent exchange, and democracy must be adhered to. (3) In terms of business management, it is necessary to improve the organizational structure of saltpeter workshops and combine them with the government for unified management, inspection, and guidance, such as registering and issuing production licenses, strictly adhering to economic procedures, formulating reasonable profit-sharing methods and simple rules, and educating workers. (4) The regulations on the price of saltpeter and the price of ash should be based on the principles of not wasting military expenses, not increasing the burden on the people, benefiting both public and private interests, and supporting the front lines. To stimulate production, rewards should be given for high output, and quality should be graded. Free purchase of ash should be encouraged, and apportionment should be minimized, with a price of one to four liang of millet per jin of ash to compensate the masses for fertilizer losses. (5) Each bureau must strictly implement the interim accounting system, and all receipts, disbursements of grain and money, and expense reimbursements must be signed and sealed by the bureau chief and deputy bureau chief. Public funds must not be borrowed under any circumstances. Opposition to one-sided worker interests and relief views in production. After the summary, each county formulated specific plans to complete the tasks based on its own situation, and the district bureaus reviewed and revised them.

　　发展硝磺业支援战争
  　太行硝磺局开会确定办法
    【太行电】为了更好的组织群众生产，支援战争，太行硝磺管理局于八月中旬召开分、县局长会议，总结一年来硝矿工作成绩。由于全区党政军各级领导干部的有力帮助，及群众实地中体验到硝磺事业的利益，使硝磺事业迅速发展，产硝地区由四个专区十五个县增至六个专区三十七个县，硝产数量比去年差不多增加一倍，硝的质量也有显著提高。会议经过十四天讨论，确定今后硝磺生产的方针与具体作法：（一）组织劳力进行硝磺生产，迅速纠正过去左倾错误给予硝磺生产的损失，退补错斗的硝业者，使其恢复生产。在老区是巩固与恢复硝磺工作，提高技术，增加产量，保证质量。在新区开展群众性的硝业生产，培养技术人材，逐渐提高数量质量。（二）根据不同地区的不同情况，组织生产大致可分为合伙经营、互助经营、独立经营三种。实际是小型作坊与家庭副业两种类型。不管什么组织形式，都必须掌握自愿等价民主三原则。（三）在经营管理上，要健全硝坊组织机构，与政府结合统一管理检查与指导。如登记与发生产许可证，严格经济手续，制订合理的分红办法与简要的制度，以及工人的教育等。（四）关于硝价灰价的规定，要根据不浪费军费、不加重民负、公私两利、支援前线的原则。为了刺激生产，产量多的要奖励，质量高的要分等。提倡自由购灰，尽量少派，并付给每斤一两到四两小米的灰价，以补偿群众肥料损失。（五）各局确实执行暂行会计制度，一切领发粮款开支报销必须有局长，副局长签名盖章，一律不准借公款。反对片面的工人利益与生产中的救济观点。总结以后，各县都根据自己情况，定出完成任务的具体计划，区局又进行了审查与修改。
