　　Taihang Electric: The local armed forces of the Fifth Sub-district of Northern Henan, in nine consecutive days from the 28th of last month to the 5th of this month, have smashed two large-scale key grain grabbing incursions by the Chiang bandits' reorganized 40th Division and its local troops. Starting from August 28th, the Chiang bandits launched a "sweep" from Cuijiaqiao, Baibiji, Wadianji and other places into the Yexian area east of the Pinghan Railway (formerly eastern Anyang), attempting to plunder grain from the area. One part of our local armed forces bravely resisted the enemy, covering the transfer of grain. Another part, with swift action, twice strongly attacked the Dougong stronghold (north of Anyang city) on the nights of September 3rd and 4th, pinning down the enemy. On the night of the 4th, the enemy was forced to flee back to its lair in the east of the road in a panic, and the Chiang bandits' key grain grabbing plan was bankrupt. At dawn on the 5th, four battalions of the bandit reorganized 40th Division, together with its local troops, totaling 3,500 men, launched a retaliatory incursion into our Fourth District of Anyang in two routes. We immediately bravely resisted them at Dongxi Biaojian. After six hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was completely routed, with a total of more than 100 enemy killed or wounded.
　　Taihang Electric: In the triangular area of Xinxiang, Huixian, and Ji counties in Northern Henan, the people's armed forces of the three counties have jointly fought, transforming the situation of the enemy-us struggle in the area. Xinxiang First District, Jixian Third District, and Huixian Fifth District are all guerrilla zones bordering the enemy, with long terrain and defense lines, and weak armed forces. At the same time, they are all located in the triangular area and are often subjected to the combined attacks of the enemies of Xin, Ji, and Hui and the threat of being cut off. It is difficult for one county to deal with the enemy alone. Therefore, these three districts have the demand to unite to deal with the enemy. In April of this year, the three counties organized joint defense and achieved close cooperation. In more than a month, they fought many beautiful battles, greatly changing the guerrilla situation in the area and making the enemy afraid to come out frequently. The experience of joint operations in the area is: (1) Closely unite and help each other. No matter who goes to whose place to fight, they are warmly received. Therefore, both sides have a great effect on encouraging and comforting each other spiritually. (2) Exchange intelligence with each other in a timely manner, so that everyone understands the situation quickly and can concentrate their strength to attack the enemy. Therefore, every time they can achieve victory. (3) They can support each other when acting alone. For example, the Xinxiang First District cooperated with the Huixian Independent Battalion to ambush the enemy in Xiaohuangtun. When the enemy detoured to the rear of Xinxiang and started fighting, the armed forces of the Jixian Third District heard the sound of gunfire and went to support Xinxiang. When the armed forces of the First District returned, they happened to sandwich the retreating enemy, and this time they eliminated 38 enemies. (4) When fighting in whose area, that family is responsible for the main attack, and other militia and work teams are uniformly commanded by it. This is convenient for command and victory because it is familiar with the terrain conditions.

　　豫北五分区地武
  　粉碎敌重点抢粮
    【太行电】豫北我五分区地武于上月二十八日至本月五日九天内，连续粉碎蒋匪整编四十师及其地方部队两次大规模重点抢粮进犯。蒋匪从八月二十八日起，分由崔家桥，白壁集，瓦店集等地向我平汉路东邺县地区（原安阳东部）进行“扫荡”，企图搜刮该地区之粮食。我地方武装一部英勇阻击敌人，掩护转移粮食。另一部即以神速动作，于九月三、四两日晚两度强袭豆公据点（安阳城北），牵制敌人。四日晚，敌被迫由路东慌忙回窟，蒋匪重点抢粮计划即告破产。五日拂晓，匪整编四十师四个营纠合其地方部队共三千五百人又分两路向我安阳四区实行报复性的进犯，我当即于东西彪涧英勇阻击。激战六小时，将敌全部击溃，总计毙伤敌一百多名。
    【太行电】豫北新（乡）、辉（县）、汲（县）三角地带，三县人民武装联合作战，转变了该地敌我斗争形势。新乡一区、汲县三区、辉县五区都是接敌游击区，地形和防线较长，武装力量薄弱，同时又都处于三角地带，常受新、汲、辉敌人的合击和断后路的威胁，一县单独对付敌人很困难，因此，这三个区就都有联合起来对付敌人的要求。今年四月间三县便组织联防，取得密切配合。月余内，打了很多次漂亮仗，大大改变了该地区的游击局面，使敌人不敢经常出来活动。该地联合作战的经验是：（一）相互密切团结与帮助，不论谁到谁的地方作战时，都是热诚招待。因此双方在精神上相互鼓励，相互安慰的作用很大。（二）互相及时交换情报，使大家了解情况都很快，能集中力量打击敌人。所以每次都能取得胜利。（三）单独活动时能相互支援，如新乡一区配合辉县独立营到小黄屯伏击敌人，敌人绕到新乡后边打起来了，汲县三区武装听到枪响，就去支援新乡，一区武装返回时，恰好把撤退的敌人夹着，这次就消灭敌人三十八名。（四）在谁家地区打仗时，由谁家担任主攻，其他民兵武工队等统一由它所指挥，这样因对地形条件熟悉，便于指挥和取得胜利。
