　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 25th—To meet the needs of the developing war situation, strengthen support for the front lines, overcome confusion, and ensure the planned and organized mobilization of civilian labor, the Yuxi Liberated Area Administrative Office promulgated front support regulations in mid-September, establishing front support organizations at all levels to lead the usual and wartime work related to front support, as well as front-line and rear-area work. These organizations are responsible for the usual investigation, organization, and training of civilian workers, and wartime guarantees for the supply of people, livestock, grain, and grass. The regulations specifically stipulate that front support headquarters be established at the military region, sub-region, and county levels, front support command posts at the district level, and front support committees at the village level, allowing for vertical command between upper and lower levels. The front support headquarters of the military region will have three specialized departments: civilian labor, supply, and rescue.
