Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 8th: After the "Four Evaluations" (evaluating fighting spirit, evaluating wisdom, evaluating command, and evaluating policies) rectification and the summer military training, a certain brigade of the Northwest People's Liberation Army displayed an astonishingly high fighting spirit and excellent combat actions in this battle to fiercely annihilate the 36th Division of the Kuomintang army on the southern Huanglong front. Du Pengcheng, a reporter from the Northwest Frontline, reported his observations from participating in this battle to Deputy Commander Peng and Gan Siqi, Director of the Political Department of the Northwest Field Army. Deputy Commander Peng believes that this in-depth combat style of party news reporters and their responsible method of reporting the situation to leading bodies are worthy of promotion. He specifically sent a letter to the Northwest General Branch to publish the letter. The original text of Du's report to Deputy Commander Peng and Director Gan is as follows:

    The last time our reporters gathered at the frontline branch, you instructed us to frequently reflect the true situation of regiments, battalions, and companies. Therefore, I will briefly describe what I saw during the annihilation of the 36th Division for your leadership's reference.

    On the 8th, when attacking Huti Mountain, the column called for planting the great banner of the People's Liberation Army on Huti Mountain. Therefore, it only took two hours to capture it in one fell swoop during the offensive. In a certain brigade that first climbed the mountain, I saw the following characteristics:

    First, the troops have made amazing progress after the summer's "Four Evaluations" and large-scale military training. This is reflected in their heroic and tenacious fighting spirit, refusing to leave the front line when wounded, and persevering in combat to the end. Almost all cadres exclaimed, "Evaluating fighting spirit has changed the troops." When the battle began, squads and groups bravely and suddenly climbed up the enemy's front lines everywhere. The enemy could not cope, so the fortifications were quickly broken through layer by layer. Zhang Darong, a soldier from a certain regiment, was wounded twice but refused to leave the front line. Blood covered his body, but he firmly denied that he was wounded. Xue Jinzhong, a soldier from a certain regiment, applied to join the Party before the battle. During the assault, he ran ahead of the entire class, drilled through a hole pierced by a shell, and threw five grenades, wiping out an enemy squad. He was wounded three times, and although the wounds were serious, he did not leave the front line. He said, "I won't go down. As long as I don't sacrifice, I will strive to join the Party!" When he rushed up, he was stunned by a shell. When he regained consciousness, he climbed up again to charge. Many soldiers suddenly pounced on the enemy's gun emplacements, stuffing explosive packs and grenades into the "turtle nests" (underground bunkers). Qiao Bosheng, the squad leader of the eighth squad of a certain regiment, and a soldier pounced into the enemy crowd. The follow-up troops lost contact with them. The enemy threw grenades at them. He quickly picked up four or five and returned them to the enemy. Then he pounced on the enemy's heavy machine gun, killing the enemy gunner, and immediately turned the enemy's gun to fire on the enemy. They generally not only sustained three or four wounds without leaving the front line, but also refused to be carried away when wounded, saying, "Don't worry about me, just attack!" They crawled down themselves, struggling to return. The fourth company of a certain regiment suddenly inserted itself into the enemy's heart—the Huti Mountain temple peak. There were twenty-two wounded in the entire company, some with three or four wounds, some with broken legs, and some with broken arms. The entire eleventh regiment had more than sixty seriously wounded, but no one went down. They said, "Even if we die, we want to join the Party." When they and the ninth company rushed to the final group of fortifications on the top of the mountain, they started throwing grenades at each other. Smoke obscured the sky, and the mountains shook. Many companies rushed up, but could not gain a foothold. They lay on the ground and rolled out a little, turned over and pounced again. This was repeated three or four times, or even seven or eight times. In short, they were determined not to retreat a step, "Wherever we advance, we will hold that position." A squad in the second company of a certain regiment was bleeding from all seven orifices due to a shell explosion. Everyone said they had been killed, but they crawled out of the smoke and charged forward again. The fourth company of a certain regiment climbed up again and again, once, twice, three times, four times, to plant the victory red flag on the top of the mountain. When the ladders were broken and people were wounded, they built them again and climbed again. From this side, that side, all directions, regardless of any danger, the red flag finally fluttered on the top of Huti Mountain. This heroism is truly admirable!

    Second, the battle fully demonstrated conscious and automatic combat morale. Lower-level cadres and soldiers used their brains; there were many examples of combat being automatically continued by acting leaders after squad leaders and platoon leaders were wounded or killed. There were many vivid examples of resourcefulness, taking the initiative to find the enemy's weaknesses and subdue them. Peng Qingyun, Zhang Youde, and other six young soldiers from the second company of a certain regiment were praised as "Little Tigers." They repeatedly engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, shouting, charging, and killing, penetrating directly into the enemy's midst. When they lost contact with their own company, they asked the third company to command them. Wang Chenghai, a soldier from the fourth company, after everyone in his squad was defeated, ran to the second platoon and said, "I am under your command!" and continued fighting. In this way, no matter who a soldier lost contact with, as long as you were one of our own, he would join in and fight together. This spontaneity made the enemy helpless. Because once they attacked, every squad, every group, and every individual climbed up from all directions. No matter how capable the enemy was, they could not cope. As long as one person went up, if the enemy could not kill him, he would charge and kill from left and right, making it impossible for the enemy to respond.

    Third, they feared no difficulties or sacrifices to support neighboring fraternal units. The fifth company of a certain regiment automatically inserted itself to help a neighboring unit repel an enemy counterattack and recapture the lost position of the neighboring unit. When a neighboring unit on the right of a certain regiment was threatened by the enemy, the eighth company of that unit automatically repelled three enemy counterattacks, repelling several enemy counterattacks in a very difficult and almost impossible-to-stand situation. When the third company of that unit was blocked in its attack, the second company automatically supported it from the other end. The enemy was threatened from both front and rear, and was thus wiped out in one fell swoop.

    Fourth, our infantry-artillery coordination was the most outstanding in this battle (but there were also shortcomings). As soon as our infantry charged, artillery fire was always ahead of the infantry, destroying enemy firepower points and blasting the enemy with their men and weapons to the side. As our infantry advanced, the artillery fire immediately shifted to the front of the infantry, encouraging the commanders and fighters to constantly shout, "Good shot!" It was very common for rifle grenades to be fired into enemy gun emplacements. The soldiers in these companies were also very surprised. They said, "Practicing tactics has really taught us skills."

    Fifth, the heroic examples on the battlefield and the mutual encouragement of political mobilization work had a great effect. For example, the political instructor of the first battalion of a certain regiment stood still even when seriously wounded, inspiring the soldiers. Some shouted slogans: "Comrades, fight resolutely!" "Comrades, be calm!" "Communists must be heroic, and not leave the front line when wounded!" "Long live combat heroes!" These slogans resounded throughout the battlefield. This time, a certain brigade put forward slogans such as "Everyone mobilizes, join the Party on the front line" and "Make contributions to the people's cause," which played a great role. In terms of disintegrating the enemy, they shouted, "Who are you fighting for?" "Your parents are starving, who are you fighting for?" "If you die, Chiang Kai-shek won't be sad, but your parents will be sad!" Finally, the enemy on the top of the mountain surrendered under our fierce attack and the coordination of our shouting.

    Sixth, this war was truly a mobilization of everyone. For example, the grooms and cooks of a certain regiment automatically organized ten stretchers. The captain of the medical team, doctors, and others of a certain regiment sustained serious injuries. They bandaged themselves and then bandaged the wounded, persevering until the end of the battle.

    The reason why the above facts are valuable is that they are very common actions, not individual examples. After the battle, a certain brigade suffered 370 casualties, but the enthusiasm for joining the Party was even greater, and the morale was even higher. Many soldiers sharpened their fists and rubbed their palms, saying, "It's not fun enough, we want to fight more!" All this shows the new face after the Four Evaluations movement and the summer military training. As for the shortcomings, the formation was dense at the beginning, resulting in heavy casualties, the attack was not timely enough, and the command of some cadres could not keep up with the automatic consciousness of the soldiers, etc. Because of fighting and marching, the writing is scribbled. I hope for more instructions. I wish you good health!

  　向彭副总司令反映火线见闻
    新闻工作者这种深入战斗的作风与向领导机关报告情况的办法，值得提倡推广。
    【新华社西北八日电】西北人民解放军某旅，经四评（评斗志、平智慧、评指挥、评政策）整军与夏季大练兵后，在此次黄龙南线痛歼国民党军三十六师之役中，表现了惊人高涨的斗志和优良的战斗动作。西北前线记者杜鹏程特将参加此次战斗的见闻，报告了彭副总司令及西北野战军政治部甘泗淇主任。彭副总司令认为党的新闻工作者这种深入战斗的作风与负责向领导机关报告情况的办法，值得提倡推广，特致函西北总分社，将该函予以发表。杜向彭副总司令、甘主任的报告原文如下：
    前次我们记者在前线分社集会，你们指示我们经常把团、营、连真实情况反映上来，故我将消灭三十六师中所见情形简述如下，以供领导上参考。
    八日攻壶梯山时，纵队号召把人民解放军大旗插在壶梯山上，故进攻中仅两小时便一举攻克。我在首先登山的某旅看到有如下几个特点：
    第一，部队在夏季四评大练兵后有了惊人的进步，表现在战斗上的英勇顽强，负伤不下火线，坚持战斗到底。几乎是全体干部都惊叹地说：“评斗志后改变了部队”。当战斗一开始，班和小组勇猛突然的在敌人前沿上到处往上爬，敌人没办法应付，故一层层的工事迅速的被突破。某团战士张大荣两次负伤不下火线，血流满身，他坚决不承认自己负伤。某团战士薛进中战斗前要求入党，冲锋时，一个人跑到全班前面，从被炮弹打穿的孔中钻进去，投了五颗手榴弹，敌人一个班被打垮，他负伤三次虽很重，不下火线。他说：“我不下去，只要我牺牲不了，我总要争取入党！”他冲上去时，被炮弹震昏了，当他清醒后又爬上去冲锋了。很多战士，突然扑到敌工事枪眼下，把爆炸弹、手榴弹塞进王八窝（伏地碉）。某团八班长乔伯生和一个战士，扑到敌群中，后续部队和他失掉联络，敌人向他们投手榴弹，他迅速的捡起四五个回敬敌人，然后他猛扑到敌人重机枪前面打死敌射手，即刻扭转敌人的枪打敌人。他们普遍的不但负三、四次伤不下火线，而且负伤不要人抬，“不要管我，你们只管攻！”他们自己往下爬，挣扎着回去。某团四连突然插在敌人心脏——壶梯山庙顶上，全连有二十二个负伤者，有的负伤三、四处，有的被打坏腿，打断臂，十一团全团负重伤六十余人，但都没有一个人下去，他们“死也要入党”。当他们和九连冲到山顶最后的集团工事边，双方就拼起手榴弹，烟雾遮天，山摇地动。很多连队冲上去，但站不住脚，就卧在地下往外滚一点，翻过身又扑上去。就这样三、四次甚至于七、八次反复。总之一个决心，不向后退一步，“进到那一块就站到那一块”。某团二连一个小组被炮弹震的七窍出血，大家都说他们被炸死，但他们从烟雾中爬起来又向前冲了。某团四连为把胜利红旗插上山顶，一次、二次、三次、四次，不断的往上爬。梯打断了，人负伤了，再架，再爬，这面，那面，四面八方，不顾什么危险，红旗终于招展在壶梯山顶。这种英雄主义，真是令人万分敬佩！
    第二，战斗中充分表现了自觉自动的战斗情绪。下级干部、战士群众大家用脑子；班长、排长伤亡后，战斗自动代理继续战斗的例子非常多。有许多急中生智的生动例子，主动找敌人的弱点制敌人于死地。某团二连彭青云、张有德等六个青年战士被誉为小老虎，他们反复和敌肉搏，喊话，冲杀，直插入敌人中间，和自己连队失掉了联络，他们就要求三连指挥他们。四连战士王承海当全班人打完后，跑到二排说：“我属你指挥！”又继续战斗了。就是这样，战士们在失去联络后不管谁，只要你是自己人，他即参加进去一起战斗。这种自动性使敌人毫无办法。因为一攻击，每班、每小组、每个人即四方八面往上爬，敌人有多大本事也顾不过来，只要上去一个人，敌人打不死，他就左右冲杀，使敌人无法应付。
    第三，为了支援友邻兄弟部队不怕任何困难和牺牲。某团五连自动插过去帮友邻部队打退敌人反冲锋，夺取友邻失去的阵地。某团右邻部队受到敌人威胁，该部八连即自动打退敌人三次反冲锋，在非常困难，几乎是无法立脚的情形下，连续打退敌人几次反冲锋。该部三连攻敌受阻，二连就自动从另一端支援，敌前后受威胁，于是被一举消灭。
    第四，我步炮协同在这次作得最出色（缺点也有）。我步兵一冲锋，炮火老在步兵前头摧毁敌人火力点，将敌连人带武器炸的摔在一旁。我步兵一前进，炮兵火力即转移至步兵前面，鼓励着指战员们不断喊：“打的好”！枪榴弹从敌枪眼打进去，更是非常普遍的。这些连战士也深为奇怪，他们说：“练战术硬是学到本领了”。
    第五，战场上的英雄范例及相互鼓舞的政治鼓动工作作用很大。如某团一营教导员负重伤屹立不动，鼓舞了战士。有的是喊口号：“同志们，坚决打！”“同志们，沉住气！”“共产党员要英勇，负伤不下火线！”“战斗英雄万岁！”这些口号响彻战场。这次某旅提出“人人鼓动，火线上入党”、“为人民事业立功”等口号起了很大作用。在瓦解敌人方面则喊：“你为谁打仗？”“你的父母受饿，你为谁打仗？”“你们死了，蒋介石不难过，你的父母难过！”最后山顶上的敌人便是在我猛攻和喊话配合下缴枪的。
    第六，此次战争真是全体动员起来了。如某团马夫、伙夫自动组织起来十付担架。某团卫生队队长、医生等负重伤，他们给自己包扎好，又给伤员包扎，一直坚持到战斗结束。
    以上事实之所以可贵，由于是一种非常普遍的行动，而不是个别例子。在战斗后，某旅伤亡三百七十名，但是要求入党的风气更盛，士气更高。很多战士磨拳擦掌：“还没有过瘾，还要打！”这一切说明四评运动及夏季军事练兵后的新面貌。至于缺点方面，则是开始时队形密集，伤亡大，攻击不够及时，有些干部的指挥还赶不上战士的自动自觉等。因为打仗行军，写得潦草，希多指示。敬祝健康！
