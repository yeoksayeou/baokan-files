Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 7th: At the closing ceremony of the Sixth National Labor Congress, General Lin Biao delivered a speech on behalf of the Northeast Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party. He said: "The participants in this conference include not only representatives from all liberated areas, but also representatives from the China Labor Association and representatives of workers from major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. This signifies a unity of the working class with significant historical importance. This conference is taking place in an era when the people's revolutionary war is achieving great victories. Currently, China is undergoing an unprecedented people's revolutionary war in its history. It is because of the hatred accumulated by the people from thousands of years of oppression, the accumulated experience, and the accumulated courage and strength that the people can wage such a massive war of liberation. This war is the expression of various long-term people's struggles developing to their highest form, and it will fundamentally change China's history of thousands of years. Chinese history will move forward under the conscious guidance of the people's leading party – the Communist Party, and the leading class – the working class. The Chinese people's heroic struggle against the enemy has been numerous, long, and magnificent, but only this time has it reached an unprecedented scale; only this time, with the leadership of the working class, is there a guarantee of inevitable victory; and only this time is it being conducted with such a high degree of consciousness. Chiang Kai-shek, the chieftain of the Chinese civil war, and the reactionary feudalist bureaucratic capitalism, colluded with American imperialism, attempting to reduce the Chinese people to slaves of American imperialism. They thought their offensive could suppress the working class and democratic forces, and that their power was absolute. Of course, they have considerable strength, with a reactionary regime and army, and American imperialism as their backing. However, they are reactionary, regressive, and violate the people's will, so they are destined to suffer final defeat and destruction. With the working class and the Chinese Communist Party, their reactionary attempts cannot be realized! In the two years of war, they have not only failed to defeat the people, but have been defeated by the people. In the future, the Kuomintang reactionary group will accelerate towards complete collapse. Now, the Chinese working class should be more aware of the greatness of the struggle tasks and resolutely lead the struggle to the final victory. Therefore, the working class must first unite itself. History proves that if the people want liberation, there is no other way but unity; only unity can defeat the enemy." General Lin Biao then pointed out: "In the liberated areas, workers have already become the masters of society and the state. In the future, they must further unite to participate in the current liberation struggle, support the war, and develop production. They must ensure that the quantity of weapons and ammunition produced is large and the quality is high; they must raise labor enthusiasm to the highest level, striving to work hard, study business, and improve their political level, preparing to be the leading class of the national regime. The workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas should be more courageous and confident in the liberation struggle; the workers in every city must prepare their strength well and coordinate wherever the People's Liberation Army advances. They must protect the machines and put them into production once liberated." General Lin Biao said: "In the past, workers have made great efforts, actively producing in the liberated areas and bravely resisting in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. In the future, they must further demonstrate the spirit of active production and the spirit of heroic resistance to strive for the final victory to come sooner and faster!"

　　劳大闭幕会上
  　林彪将军讲话
    【新华社东北七日电】在第六次全国劳动大会的闭幕典礼中，林彪将军代表中共东北中央局讲话。他说：“这次与会者，不仅包括全解放区代表，而且包括了中国劳动协会代表以及国民党统治区各大城市职工的代表，这表示了工人阶级有重大历史意义的团结。这次大会正处在人民革命战争取得伟大胜利的时代。目前中国正进行着有史以来空前规模的人民革命战争。由于几千年来人民遭受压迫所积蓄的仇恨，所积累的经验，所积累的勇气和力量，所以人民才能进行如此巨大规模的解放战争。这次战争是各种各样长时期的人民斗争发展到最高形式的表现，它将把中国几千年的历史根本地改变。中国历史将在人民的领导政党——共产党、领导阶级——工人阶级自觉地指导下向前发展。中国人民为反抗敌人所进行的英勇斗争是很多、很长、很壮烈的，但只有这一次，才达到空前的规模；只有这一次，由于有工人阶级为领导，才有必然胜利的保证；也只有这一次，才是如此高度自觉地进行着。中国内战头子蒋介石和反动的封建主义官僚资本主义同美帝国主义勾结，企图把中国人民沦为美帝国主义的奴隶，他们以为他们的进攻可以把工人阶级和民主力量打下去，以为他们的力量是可以为所欲为的；当然，他们是有相当力量，有反动的政权和军队，又有美帝国主义作后台，然而，他们是反动倒退违反人民的，所以就注定了他们必然遭受最后的失败和灭亡。有了工人阶级和中国共产党，他们的反动企图就不能实现！两年的战争中，他们不但没有打败人民，反而被人民打败了。今后国民党反动集团就将加速地走向完全崩溃。现在，中国工人阶级应该更加觉悟到斗争任务的伟大，坚决领导斗争到最后胜利。因此，工人阶级首先本身要团结。历史证明：人民要想解放，除了团结，便没有第二条道路；只有团结，才能战胜敌人”。林彪将军继指出：“在解放区，工人已经作了社会国家的主人，今后就是要进一步团结起来参加目前的解放斗争，支援战争，发展生产。要使制造的武器弹药数量多，质量高；要把劳动热忱提到最高度，一面努力工作，一面努力学习业务，提高政治水平，准备作全国政权的领导阶级。国民党统治区的职工，应对解放斗争更勇敢，更有信心；每个城市的工人都要好好准备力量，人民解放军打到那里，就在那里配合。要保护机器，一经解放即转入生产。”林彪将军说：“过去工人已经尽了极大的努力，在解放区积极生产，在国民党统治区英勇反抗，今后更要高度地发挥积级生产的精神，英勇反抗的精神，争取最后胜利更快更早到来！”
