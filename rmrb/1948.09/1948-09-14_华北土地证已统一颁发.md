Inquiries and Answers

　　North China Land Certificates Have Been Uniformly Issued
    To the Editor:
    Farmers are very eager to receive land certificates, but we have encountered two problems in our actual implementation that we cannot solve:
    (1) There is an "annual yield" on the land certificate of Ping Shan County. The county and district instructed: "The agricultural tax this year is basically based on the unified tax yield of last year. Individual unreasonable cases can be changed after review and discussion." However, the district also said: "According to last year's yield, the actual production of land in Ping Shan Chengguan cannot reach that level." Herein lies the problem. If the land certificate is issued according to last year's tax yield, it is generally higher than the actual yield. If it is filled in according to the actual yield, the county and district instruct that it generally cannot be lowered this year. So, how should it be filled in reasonably? Based on the actual yield or based on the tax yield?
    (2) According to my personal understanding, the land certificate should replace the old documents of the past, but the current land certificate actually cannot replace them. Because the "plot" and "house type" only have the number of mu, but no length and width, this reduces the importance the masses attach to the land certificate, and will cause many disputes in the future, and it will be even more troublesome to change it in the future.
    The above two problems are hindering the issuance of land certificates. Please reply.

    Answer: Regarding the land certificate issue, we have requested the Border Region Government's Department of Civil Affairs to reply as follows:
    After the merger of the two regions, when studying the formulation and issuance of unified North China land certificates, it was considered that the "annual yield" item was not easy to fill in appropriately and was also not important. Therefore, the newly issued North China Land and Property Ownership Certificate has cancelled this item and added the length and width item. The land certificate form issued by Jin-Cha-Ji last year originally did not have a length and width item, but had an annual yield item. If the old certificate form issued last year is still used, in order to avoid wasting labor and materials, the annual yield can be changed to fill in the length and width. If it is considered that the column is too narrow and inconvenient to fill in, the new certificate paper form can be changed to be used voluntarily by the masses. This new certificate and the filling method have been issued to governments at and above the county level by the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee on August 9th with the order Min-She No. 9. – Editor.

### 华北土地证已统一颁发

专栏：询问与答复

　　华北土地证已统一颁发编辑同志：
    农民对发土地证要求很迫切，但在我们实际执行当中，却遇到了两个问题不能解决：
    （一）平山县土地证上有个“年产量”，县区指示：“今年纳农业税，基本上以去年的统税产量为标准。个别不合理者，经过审查讨论方可变动”。但区里又说：“按去年的产量，平山城关的地实际产不出来。”这里问题就来了。发土地证按去年纳税产量，一般高于实产量，按实产量填，县区又指示，今年一般的不能降。那么，究竟怎样填法合理呢？以实产量为根据还是以纳税产量为根据呢？
    （二）根据我个人的了解，土地证要代替过去的旧文书，但按现在的土地证实际上代替不了。因为“地段”“房别”只有亩数，而没有弓口（即长横阔），这样，就减低了群众对土地证的重视，将来也会因此而发生好多纠纷，将来如再换更为麻烦。
    以上两个问题，已阻碍着发土地证的进行，请答复。
    （平山一区王俊峰）
    答：关于土地证问题我们已请边府民政厅答复如下：
    两区合并后，在研究制发华北统一土地证时，已认为年产量一项不易适当填写，且亦无关重要，故新发之华北土地房产所有证内已取消此项，并把长横阔一项增添上了。去年晋察冀所发之土地证式样，原无长横阔一项，而有年产量一项，如仍用去年所发旧证式样，为避浪费工料起见，可将年产量改为填写长辽阔，如嫌该栏狭窄不便填写，可根据群众自愿改用新发证纸式样填写。此项新证及填写办法，已由晋冀鲁豫边区政府及晋察冀边区行政委员会于八月九日以民社字第九号令发至县以上各级政府。——编者。
