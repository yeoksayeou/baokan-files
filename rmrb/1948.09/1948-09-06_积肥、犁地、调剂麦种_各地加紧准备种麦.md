　　Various Regions Intensify Preparations for Wheat Planting
　　Many Areas in Southern Hebei Actively Reclaim Wasteland and Hasten Wheat Planting
　　[Jinan Telegraph] Many areas in southern Hebei are reclaiming wasteland in preparation for wheat planting. The Fifth Special Prefecture held a meeting of Hengshui and Ji counties to discuss reclaiming the thousands of acres of wasteland bordering the two counties. After discussion, the conference resolved: (1) Establish four wasteland reclamation stations, each with dedicated personnel responsible for immediately organizing labor to plow the land with tractors in preparation for wheat planting. (2) Rationally allocate draft cattle and loan grain to solve the problem of insufficient animal power. Hengshui will be loaned 40 draft cattle, and Ji County will be loaned 60 draft cattle; each head is calculated at 1,500 jin of rice, totaling 150,000 jin of loan grain. An additional 50,000 jin of loan grain will be allocated separately by the Special Prefecture. The government should provide appropriate care for disaster victims newly returned from the Jiang-occupied areas or returning home from the Northeast who are willing to reclaim wasteland. To ensure the smooth completion of wasteland reclamation, cadres with experience and skills in wasteland reclamation will be assigned to work with the reclamation stations to promptly inspect, research, and promote the work.
　　[Another Telegraph] Some villages in Guangping, Chengci, and Qiu counties are actively reclaiming wasteland in response to the call for reducing burdens on wasteland reclamation and are preparing to plant wheat. After Guangping arranged wasteland reclamation, each district achieved great results in the first half of August (half a month). In Nanhancun, the Second District, 23 teams of livestock plowed wasteland every day, 52 militia members each took responsibility for one mu, and 47 semi-able-bodied laborers gathered thatch. 1.4 hectares of wasteland have now been reclaimed. Dongchubao has a total of 73 mu of wasteland and has organized 15 teams of livestock and 70 militia members to jointly reclaim the land. On the third day of the seventh lunar month, Beixiabao organized ten teams of livestock to plow wasteland. Village cadres specifically assigned tasks to supervise and inspect, and in less than three days, 65.3 mu of wasteland were reclaimed. Nanwangfeng, Zhangtun, Yantun, and other villages have all reclaimed their wasteland. A total of more than 30 villages have reclaimed 2.65 hectares of wasteland. The First District had a total of 25.58 hectares of wasteland, of which 19.27 hectares have now been reclaimed. The Third District originally had 1.52 hectares of wasteland, which has now been completely reclaimed. Statistics show that there are still 8.61 hectares of wasteland in the whole county, which is estimated to be completely reclaimed in five days. Beisanhucun in the Second District of Chengci and Hecun and Dongliucun in the Third District have all started wasteland reclamation, and some are preparing to plant wheat after reclamation. In Qifangcun, the Second District of Qiu County, the masses benefited greatly from wasteland reclamation last year. Li Chuncheng, Sui Mingli, and Sui Jialu group prepared wasteland early this year to prepare for wheat planting, and each mutual aid group is planning to reclaim all the wasteland in the village.
　　Xin District of Pingyao Organizes Wasteland Reclamation
　　[Taiyue Telegraph] The Pingyao Democratic Government is actively organizing the masses in the new district to eliminate wasteland in preparation for wheat planting. In the newly liberated area of Pingyao, due to the past rule of Yan bandit's conscription, grain grabbing, and combined military-agricultural tyranny, there is a lot of wasteland throughout the county. According to statistics from the Third District, there are more than 20,000 mu, accounting for one-sixth of the district's land. Some villages are even more barren. For example, Beiwanggou village has 1,547 mu of wasteland, accounting for one-quarter of the village's land, and even the yards in front of the houses are barren and no one is planting them. However, Yan bandit continued to demand grain and money, forcing some people to be unable to survive, and many people had to flee to other places and wander around. Forty-one households fled Beiwanggou village, accounting for one-sixth of the village's population. After this liberation, after the democratic government thoroughly publicized various policies, everyone was overjoyed and actively produced to catch up with planting buckwheat and other late autumn crops. According to statistics from the Third District, more than 3,000 mu of late autumn crops have been planted. The Third District Office is actively organizing the masses to eliminate wasteland and rush to plant wheat.

　　积肥、犁地、调剂麦种
  　各地加紧准备种麦
  　冀南不少地区积极灭荒赶种麦
    【冀南电】冀南不少地区正在开垦荒地准备种麦。五专署为开垦冀、衡交界的千顷荒，召开了冀衡两县垦荒会议。经大会讨论后，最后决议：（一）建立四处开荒站，各站均设专人负责，马上组织力量，以拖拉机翻土，准备种麦。（二）合理分配耕牛贷粮，解决畜力困难。计衡水贷耕牛四十头，冀县贷耕牛六十头；每头按一千五百市斤米计算，共合贷粮十五万斤。另外五万斤贷粮，由专署负责另行分配。对新由蒋占区归来或由东北回家愿开荒的灾民，政府应予适当照顾。为顺利完成开荒工作，还抽出对开荒有经验和有技术的干部，配合各开荒站及时检查研究推动开荒工作。
    【又电】广平、成磁、邱县一些村庄，在开荒减免负担的号召下，积极开荒，准备种麦。广平布置了开荒后，半个月（八月上半月）各区开荒都有很大成绩。二区南韩村，每天有二十三犋牲口犁荒地，五十二个自卫队员，每人分了一亩，还有四十七个半劳力拾茅草。现下已开荒地一顷四十亩。东处堡共有荒地七十三亩，组织了十五犋牲口，七十个自卫队员下地伙开荒。北下堡旧历七月初三，组织了十犋牲口下地开荒，村干具体分工督促检查，不到三天功夫开荒六十五亩三分。南王封、张屯、烟屯等村都已将荒地开完。共计三十多村开荒二顷六十五亩。一区共荒地二十五顷五十八亩，现已开起来十九顷二十七亩。三区原有荒地一顷五十二亩，现已开完。统计全县还有荒地八顷六十一亩，估计五天以后就可全部开完。成磁二区北散湖村，三区河町村、东流村等都已进行开荒，有的开完后正准备种麦。邱县二区七方村群众，因去年开荒沾光很大，李春成、睢明礼、睢家禄组今年早早就整好了荒地，准备种麦，各个互助组正计划把全村荒地都开出来。
    平遥新区组织灭荒
    【太岳电】平遥民主政府积极组织新区群众消灭荒地，准备种麦。平遥新解放区，由于过去受阎匪的抽丁、抢粮、及兵农合一暴政的统治，全县荒芜土地很多，据三区统计：即有两万余亩，占全区土地六分之一。有个别村荒得更多。如北汪沟一村，就荒了一千五百四十七亩，占全村土地四分之一，连门前园地也荒的没人种。但阎匪又继续要粮要款，逼得有些人更无法活下去，许多群众只得流落他乡，四下逃亡。北汪沟村逃荒四十一户，占全村户口六分之一。这次解放后，经民主政府深入宣传各种政策后，大家欢欣若狂，积极生产赶种荞麦等晚秋。据三区统计，已种晚秋三千余亩。三区区公所正积极组织群众，消灭荒地赶种麦子。
