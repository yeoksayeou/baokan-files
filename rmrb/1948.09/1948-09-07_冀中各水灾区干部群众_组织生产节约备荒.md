　　[Central Hebei Electric] Cadres and masses in various disaster areas of Central Hebei are carrying out a movement to save the disaster through thrift. In Jinghai County, the Ziya River breached its banks in July, inundating 136 villages and 8,800 hectares of land. More than 95,000 people suffered from the flood, and 60,000 people are unable to maintain their lives. The county party committee specifically instructed all cadres in the disaster area to vigorously mobilize and help the victims collect wild vegetables, gather grass seeds, and dig groundnuts to save the disaster through thrift. More than 4,000 disaster victims were organized to dig groundnuts in Wen'an. Cadres were also responsible for taking the lead and contacting local village cadres to properly resettle the victims. This year, the groundnuts in the low-lying areas of Wen'an are large and plentiful, and each person can dig seven large sheng a day, and some can dig a dou a day. On average, each person digs half a dou a day, which can produce nine jin of flour. Each dou can be sold for 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, which can be exchanged for at least half a dou of grain. In Qizhuang and Dazhangzhuang villages in the Second District, 80% of the households rely on digging groundnuts for food. After 49 villages in Suning were flooded, the district held a joint meeting of district and village cadres, calling on all men, women, and children in the villages to mobilize and engage in transportation and sales, develop the textile industry, collect more wild vegetables and leaves, and carry out a movement to save the disaster through thrift. In Dawang Village, Renhe, out of 140 households, more than 50 are collecting wild vegetables. Now each household has collected three to four hundred jin. Cadres and teachers in various places are also carrying out a movement to save the disaster through thrift. Teachers at Anping Primary School are actively donating rice. As of August 18, teachers throughout the county had donated 3,410 jin of rice. In Wuqi County, district cadres decided to save one or two liang of rice a day starting in August to help the victims. Now cadres throughout the county have saved 690 jin of rice, all of which has been given to the victims.

  　组织生产节约备荒
    【冀中电】冀中各灾区干部、群众开展节约救灾运动。静海县，子牙河于七月间决口，被淹一百三十六个村，淹地八千八百多顷。九万五千多人遭受水灾，现有六万人没法维持生活。该县县委特指示灾区全体干部，大力发动和帮助灾民采野菜、弄草子、挖地梨节约救灾。并组织了四千多灾民，到文安去挖地梨。并有干部负责带头和当地区村干部接洽，适当安置灾民。今年文安洼地梨又大又多，每人一天能挖七大升，多的一天能挖一大斗。平均每人一天挖半大斗；能出九斤面。每斗可卖四、五千元，最少可换半斗粮食。二区齐庄、大章庄等村十分之八的户依靠挖地梨吃饭。肃宁四十九个村被水淹以后，区里开了区村干部联席会，号召各村男女老少动员起来搞运销，开展纺织业，多采野菜和树叶，开展节约救灾运动。任河大汪村，一百四十户，有五十多家采野菜的。现在各户都采了三、四百斤。各地干部、教员也开展节约救灾运动。安平小学教员都踊跃献米。截止八月十八日，全县教师已献米三千四百一十斤。无极县区干部为救济灾民，决定从八月份开始一天节米一两。现在全县干部已节米六百九十斤，全部给了灾民。
