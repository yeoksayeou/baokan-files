Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. The Danish government is supplying weapons to the Kuomintang government. According to a TASS dispatch from Copenhagen on the 18th, citing the "Bikuben and En报" newspaper, the value of the weapons Denmark has delivered to the Kuomintang government in the past few months has reached 1.1 million Danish Kroner (approximately $229,600 USD). Commentators here remarked that since the US imperialists' $500 million aid failed to save the Kuomintang reactionaries from defeat, but instead brought them closer to death, the Danish government's mere tens of thousands of dollars in aid is nothing more than a drop in the bucket, like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. The Danish reactionaries, violating the will and interests of the Danish people and willingly becoming enemies of the Chinese people, will surely suffer the consequences of their actions.

　　丹麦竟以武器援蒋
  　违反人民意志无异螳臂当车
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】丹麦政府正以武器供应国民党政府。据塔斯社哥本哈根十八日电引“比科本和恩报”消息称：过去数月间丹麦所交与国民党政府的武器，已达一百一十万丹币（约合二十二万九千六百余美元）。此间舆论界就此评称：既然过去美帝国主义五十万万美元的援助，没有能够挽救国民党反动派的失败，反使其日益接近死亡，那末，现在丹麦政府区区几十万美元的援助不外杯水车薪，正如螳臂当车一样。丹麦反动派违反丹麦人民意志和利益，甘与中国人民为敌，必将自食其恶果。
