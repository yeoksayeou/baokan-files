　　To Comrade Song Zhian of the North China Party School:
    Regarding the issue of your family's class status, you may write a letter to your county committee detailing the specific circumstances and request a re-determination during the upcoming revision of class statuses. If your family was evicted and is currently unable to make a living, you may request assistance from the county and district to be resettled.
    To Comrade Chang Daozhong of the North China Party School:
    Regarding your question "Which counties are included in the Jinzhong Administrative Office," please refer to the news item "Jinzhong Military Region Administrative Office Officially Established" on page one of this newspaper on September 5th.
    To Xu Wenjun of Jingxing Coal Mine:
    According to government decrees, the people have the freedom to migrate and reside. You are free to move and change your registered residence for the convenience of employment and work.
    To Comrade Li Xiulan of Shexian People's Education Center:
    If a woman remains living in her parents' home after marriage, she can be counted as part of her parents' household and allocated land and property. However, she cannot receive a duplicate share in her husband's home. Regardless of whether a female cadre is married or not, her direct relatives should be treated as revolutionary family members.
    To Geng Kaosheng of Beishuiyu Village, Zanhuang:
    Your village cadre's statement that "the method of providing assistance to the families of revolutionary staff will not be implemented this year and will be considered next year" is incorrect. This method is effective from the date of its promulgation, and all levels of government must implement it.
    To Comrade Yang Zhengzhi of the Sixth Column Military Law Office:
    The matter of "post office backlog of official documents and letters for seventy-six days" and "secret documents being opened midway" has been reported to the General Post Office for investigation.

　　信箱华北党校宋治安同志：
    你家庭的成份问题，可将具体情形函告你县县委会，在最近进行改订成份工作中重新改订。你家被扫地出门，如目前仍无法生活，可请县区予以安置。华北党校常道中同志：
    你问“晋中行署包括哪些县份”可参看九月五日本报一版“晋中军区行署正式成立”之消息。井陉煤矿许温君：
    根据政府法令人民有迁移居住之自由，你为了就业与工作上的便利，自由迁居改籍是可以的。涉县民教馆李秀兰同志：
    女子结婚后，生活居住仍在娘家，可以在娘家算人口，并分配土地、财产，但不能在婆家重分一份，女干部不管结婚与否，其直系亲属应按革命家属待遇。赞皇北水峪村耿考生君：
    你村村干说：“今年不按革命职员家属代耕办法执行，等明年再说”是不对的，因该办法自公布之日起，即行有效，各级政府均须执行。六纵军法处杨正之同志：
    关于“邮局积压公文信件七十六天”与“秘密文件半途拆口”之事已转告邮总，请他们检查。
