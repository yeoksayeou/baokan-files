　　The Blockade at Dunfang

　　On July 7th, we knocked out six of the enemy's vehicles. As dusk fell, the Third Battalion of the ×× Unit arrived at Dunfang Village, and a small enemy force had also slipped through here. The sky was heavily overcast, and despite searching until nearly dawn, nothing was discovered. The soldiers were exhausted from marching and fighting, and the fortifications were not well-prepared. By the time it was fully light, the enemy's scouts were already at the edge of our position. The Seventh Company had just returned from outside the village to build fortifications when the enemy's scouts were already at the edge of our position. We captured the two scouts alive, suppressed them with fire, drove them back a bit, and defeated the enemy.

　　However, ten minutes later, the enemy organized its firepower, and four artillery groups launched a fierce attack on our position, first hammering away at the Ninth Company's position to our due south for quite a while, but unable to break through. Then, they turned to attack the Eighth Company to the southeast.

　　The Eighth Company's position was a hundred meters or so from the village, built in a small east-west ditch, with a small bridge consisting of three large stone slabs in the middle. The soldiers' individual foxholes were dug on the west side of the bridge, and the ditch was very shallow. Crawling forward, it was easy to expose oneself. Fifty or sixty meters east of the bridge, there was a large bend turning southwest. The enemy moved along the ditch to that point, and a platoon or more of troops rushed to within only thirty or forty meters of them without any regard for formation. The Eighth Squad Leader shot down an enemy company commander holding binoculars and a red flag with a burst of machine-gun fire. Immediately, a platoon leader picked up his red flag and continued to charge, but the soldiers threw a volley of grenades and shot him down as well. When the third man picked up the red flag, he was also shot down. Only then did we drive the enemy back.

　　The second time, the enemy moved up from the trenches again, no longer daring to be ostentatious or disregard formation, but instead adopted small-group tactics. The soldiers could only see their helmets and bayonets. After firing two bursts of machine-gun fire, the Eighth Company drove the enemy back again. At this time, airplanes came and strafed several times. The company commander had already been killed, and orders came from the rear to appoint the Second Platoon Leader as acting deputy company commander. However, there were only fourteen or fifteen people left at the front. The Second Platoon Leader was afraid that the small number of people would result in the loss of the position, so he had already sent three people down to make contact. At this time, there was still no news. He immediately appointed the First Squad Leader as acting platoon leader and personally went to contact the instructor, hoping to bring up a few more people. However, the artillery fire and airplane strafing were so fierce that the three people he sent were all killed or wounded, and the instructor had already been killed. He himself had only crawled a few steps before he was hit and killed.

　　The Second Squad Leader took over as platoon leader, but soon after, he was shot and killed by an enemy sniper. At this time, the soldiers were not panicked. They said very solemnly to the deputy squad leader: "The cadres have all been killed. You are the only deputy squad leader left. You are responsible for commanding us!" Li Junxiang immediately agreed: "I am responsible for command." And he said to everyone:

　　"There are only ten of us left. Let's learn from Li Haisui!"

　　Everyone silently listened to his words and put forward a common slogan: "We are here, the position is here, and we will never lose the position." Li Junxiang divided the six rifles into three groups: Zhang Zhongyuan and a liberated soldier were north of the bridge, Guo Zhenyi and Wang Laohu were south of the bridge, and Cai Laibao and Zuo Baoxiao were in the middle. Each group was responsible for one direction, monitoring the enemy. The machine gun was placed on the rear side, and all the magazines were filled to the brim. They would only fire when a large number of enemies charged up. They were only allowed to use snipers against a small number of enemies, and not to use machine guns, in order to conserve ammunition. They also took all the grenades from the dead and wounded comrades, unscrewed the caps of each grenade, pulled out the fuses, and waited for the enemy.

　　Having suffered twice, the enemy dared not advance rashly. Several small attacks were repelled by them, but the enemy's artillery fire was still very fierce. Wang Haicheng's hat was swept away by a bullet, and the accumulated soil on the individual foxholes was all pushed away by heavy machine guns. Ten or so heavy mortar shells were fired in a volley, and Zhang Zhongyuan was buried by the soil, but he crawled out again. Airplanes came and strafed straight along the ditch twice. A willow branch on the side of the ditch was broken off, and the leaves were all swept away. Holes were punched in everyone's backpacks. However, these ten people still persevered without wavering.

　　The battle was silent for a moment. The enemy was still moving forward. On the flank of the neighboring position, a blaze of light rose up. The enemy's clothes were on fire, and they fled in panic. Li Junxiang saw it and immediately told everyone: "Isn't that the × Column? They've outflanked the enemy. Look! They're firing incendiary bombs." The soldiers all knew that the incendiary bombs were what we captured at Linfen. The Yan bandit army didn't have that stuff, so the soldiers were happy. The × Column, which had captured Qixian, had also caught up. The enemy was surrounded on all sides.

　　Soon after, the superiors sent a simple map of the enemy's encirclement to the front line. The soldiers looked at the map and fought with more energy.

　　Before dusk, the Fifth Company had added a dozen more people. The enemy's attack on the Seventh Company's position to the due east had also failed to move them. The bugle sounded the charge. Li Junxiang said: "Look, it's the same old trick again. The enemy is going to retreat." Sure enough, after firing a few volleys of artillery at our position, the enemy retreated. This retreat tightened the encirclement, and they could no longer stretch out. They could neither break through nor run away.

　　The blockade at Dunfang Village was still very fierce. The enemy was a division, while we had only a battalion defending the position. The enemy had four artillery groups, at least twenty cannons. Our telephone line, less than three hundred meters long, was broken twenty times by the enemy's artillery fire. But what use was that? Our rifles turned red, and when the machine gunners moved their positions, they hugged the gun barrels and burned their faces. But the enemy was stopped, and the enemy's doomsday was also coming.

　　敦坊阻击战
    七月七号，我们打倒了敌人的六辆汽车。天擦黑的时候，××部队三营走到敦坊村，敌人的一个小部队，也从这里插过去了。天阴得厉害，搜索到天快亮了，也没有发觉什么，战士们行军中又打了仗，累得很，工事没做好，天已经大亮了。七连刚从村外收回来做工事，敌人的尖兵已经到了我们阵地边边上了。我们活捉了那两个尖兵，一阵火力压下去，撵了一节，把敌人打敌了。
    但是，十分钟以后，敌人组织了火力，四个炮兵群向我阵地猛烈攻击，先向我们正南九连的阵地啃了半天，啃不动，又转到东南啃八连了。
　八连的阵地离村还有百多米达，是在一条由东向西的小渠里修的，中间有一条三块大石板构成的小桥。战士们的单人掩体，都挖在桥西边，而渠是很浅的，匍匐前进，稍不注意便暴露了目标。桥东面，五六十米达远的地方，有一个转向西南的大拐弯，敌人顺着水渠运动到那里了，一个多排的兵力，不讲究任何队形的冲到离他们只三四十米达了，八班长一梭机枪打倒了一个挂着望远镜，手拿红旗的敌连长，马上一个排长又拿起他的红旗继续冲，战士们一排手榴弹打过去，又把他打倒了，第三个才拿起那个红旗来时，又被我们打倒了，这样才把敌人打下去。
    第二次，敌人又从壕沟里运动上来，再不敢大模大样，不讲究队形，而是采用小组动作了。战士们只能看见他们的钢盔和刺刀，八连机枪打两梭子弹后，又把敌人打退了。这时候，飞机来扫射了几次，连长已经牺牲了，后面传命令来指定二排长代理副连长，前面却只剩下了十四五个人，二排长害怕人少会丢阵地，早就连派三个人下去连络了。此时仍不见音信，他马上指定了一班长代理排长，亲自找指导员连络去，想增加几个人上来。但是，炮火与飞机扫射是那样的猛烈，他派去的三个人都牺牲挂彩了，指导员也早已牺牲了，他自己刚爬了几步，也中弹牺牲了。
    二班长代理了排长，不一会，又被敌人冷枪打着牺牲了，这时候，战士们并不惊慌，他们很沉痛的对副班长说：“干部们都牺牲了，就剩下你一个副班长了，你负责指挥我们吧！”李俊祥马上答应：我负责指挥。并向大家说：
    “就剩下我们这十来个人了，我们学习李海水吧！”
    大家都默默的听着他的话，提出了共同的口号：人在阵地在，决不丢阵地。李俊祥把六支步枪分了三个组，张忠元和一个解放战士在桥北，郭振义王老虎在桥南，蔡来保和左保小在中间，每组负责一个方向，监视敌人。机枪放在后侧，把所有的梭子都压满，等大批的敌人冲来再打，少数敌人上来只准用冷枪打，不准用机枪，好节省弹药，又把所有牺牲挂彩同志的手榴弹拿来，把每颗手榴弹的盖子拧开，把火线都拉出来，等待着敌人。
    敌人吃了两次亏，也不敢冒然前进了，一连几次的小进攻都被他们打退了，但敌人的炮火仍旧是非常猛烈的，王海成的帽子，叫子弹扫掉了，单人掩体上的积土都被重机枪推光了，十来发重炮迫击炮齐排射过来，张忠元被土埋住了又爬出来，飞机来顺着水渠直扫了两次，水渠边的一棵柳树枝子打断了，叶子都扫光了，战士们每个人的背包上都打穿了窟窿。但是，这十个人仍旧毫不动摇的坚持着。
    战斗沉寂了片刻，敌人仍向前运动，在侧面友邻阵地上，冒起了一片光，敌人的衣服烧着了，狼狈的逃窜，李俊祥看见了，马上告给大家：“这不是×纵队？他们抄到敌人侧翼了。看！他们打燃烧弹了。”战士们都知道燃烧弹是我们打临汾得来的，阎匪军没有那家伙，于是，战士们高兴了。×纵队攻下祁县也赶上来了，敌人已在我们四面的包围之中。
    不久，上级把敌人被围的形势简图传到了火线，战士们看着地图，越打越有劲了。
    黄昏以前，五连又增加上十几个人来，敌人攻正东七连的阵地也未攻动，吹起冲锋号来了，李俊祥说：“看又是那老一套，敌人要退了。”果然不一会，敌人猛烈的向我们阵地上打了几排炮后，便缩回去了。这一缩使它被包围得紧紧的，再也不能伸展了，突也突不出，跑也跑不动。
    敦坊村的阻击战，还是激烈得很的，敌人是一个师，而我们守阵地的却只一个营，敌人四个炮兵群，起码有二十门大炮，我们一条不到三百米长的电话线，竟在敌人排炮之中被打断了二十次，但那有什么用处呢？我们的步枪打红了，机枪射手转移阵地时，抱着枪筒，把脸都给烧坏了。但敌人却被阻止住了，敌人的末日，也跟着就来了。
