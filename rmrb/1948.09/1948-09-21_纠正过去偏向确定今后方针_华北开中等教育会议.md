Correcting Past Deviations and Determining Future Policies
　　North China Holds Conference on Secondary Education

　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The North China Conference on Secondary Education was held in a certain location in North China on August 25th. The conference lasted twelve days and concluded on September 5th. Based on the current needs of the People's Liberation War and the construction of the North China Liberated Area, the conference re-examined the direction, nature, and tasks of general secondary education, stipulated the implementing principles and methods for the formal education system and curriculum, corrected past confusion and deviations, and unified the thinking of education workers. Finally, it adopted draft proposals such as the implementation measures for middle schools and teachers' colleges, and the standards for the treatment of primary and secondary school teachers and staff, which were submitted to the North China Government for review and promulgation.

　　Prior to the conference, the Taihang, Taiyue, Jizhong, Jinnan, and Jilu Yu Administrative Offices had all held education conferences successively. Although the Beiyue District had not held a conference, it had made preparations for convening one. According to incomplete statistics: in the six administrative districts and one municipality in the entire region, there are 138 secondary schools (including teachers' colleges), with 23,084 students; vocational schools are not included. In the past two years, 36,168 students have been assigned to work, supplying the needs of various aspects of war and construction. North China's secondary education has made achievements and has contributed to the people. This is the result of the arduous struggle of all middle school teachers and staff and education administration cadres under extremely difficult conditions of human and material resources. However, there have also been many shortcomings and deviations in secondary education. The first is that the direction and tasks are not clear, and the development of the situation has not been adapted to in a timely manner. The unavoidable and necessary nature of training classes in the past guerrilla warfare environment for secondary schools has not been overcome in a timely manner, and a certain necessary formal system has not been established. Not enough emphasis has been placed on the basic education of cultural and scientific knowledge necessary for general middle schools. In land reform and party rectification, the rural struggle was mistakenly moved to schools in its entirety. Poor peasant associations were also organized in many schools to struggle against landlords and rich peasants, squeeze out feudalism, distribute floating wealth, and conduct three investigations, and absurd slogans such as "filling in and completing culture," "culture returning to agriculture," and "students having their own schools" were put forward, which once threw schools into a state of chaos. This situation has now been corrected. Each administrative office made a review of these situations at the education conference. Taihang focused on reviewing the so-called "vocationalization" of the education policy. Jizhong reviewed the policy towards intellectuals. All administrative offices unanimously reviewed the phenomena of lack of system, lack of planning, and lack of discipline in secondary education, and initially proposed implementation measures for secondary education. The North China Conference on Secondary Education was convened on this basis.

　　More than 40 people attended the conference, including heads of education administration and representatives of middle school and teachers' college principals from various administrative offices and cities. Major faculty members of the Second Department of North China University were also invited to participate. The conference was presided over by Comrade Chao Zhefu, former Director of the Education Department of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, and Comrade Liu Aifeng, former Director of the Education Department of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region. Comrade Zhou Yang, Minister of Propaganda of the North China Central Bureau of the CPC, personally guided the conference. First, Director Chao Zhefu made a report on the direction of secondary education, and put forward draft proposals such as the implementation measures for secondary education, which were submitted to the conference for study and discussion. The conference conducted detailed discussions, and Comrade Zhou Yang made a special speech during the discussion, which led to a consensus among the participants.

　　The Task of Middle School Education: To Cultivate Talents with Secondary Cultural Level and Basic Scientific Knowledge for the New Democratic Country

　　The conference clearly pointed out that middle school education is general education in nature. Its task is to cultivate talents with secondary cultural level and basic scientific knowledge for the New Democratic country, so that after graduation, students can participate in work after a certain professional training, or directly participate in work, or continue to study for further education, to meet different needs in various aspects. The task of teachers' colleges is to cultivate and improve primary school teachers and junior education administration cadres for the New Democratic country. The conference reviewed the past ambiguity of the direction of middle school education, blindly advocating the so-called "vocationalization," advocating "central work is the central curriculum," and inappropriately emphasizing "learning from doing" and "teaching from doing," which led to the relaxation or even cancellation of the cultural education that should be possessed by general middle schools. For example, Yubei Middle School, under this policy, students went out of the school and organized three work-study groups to learn in actual work. In one semester, only three Chinese language articles were taught, and they were also taught as political classes. As a result, the students' working ability was not as good as that of the local cadres, and the students' cultural level could not be improved as necessary. In addition, due to financial difficulties, the policy of "supporting study through work" was inappropriately put forward, resulting in an excessive increase in students' production, and the school became a "production team." In many schools, students did not attend classes for even half the time. Therefore, the low cultural level of students has become a common phenomenon, which has been criticized by all sectors of society. The students themselves also strongly demand to learn culture. However, many schools ignored this legitimate demand of students, and some schools even asked students to reflect on their so-called "pure cultural viewpoint." This spring, many schools' enrollment simply emphasized composition. In the entrance examination, some students could only write two of the three characters of their own names. According to statistics from 25 middle schools, half of the new students enrolled this spring were below the level of primary school graduation. The same is true for primary schools. Some teachers have a low cultural level and cannot teach students to read, and some teach students to engage in production and social activities, and do not teach students to read. The masses reflected that it was "a dou of rice for one character," and said that "the Eighth Route Army's schools are good, but they don't know how to read."

　　The conference reviewed the chaotic phenomenon of lack of system and lack of planning in secondary education in the past, pointing out that the common shortcomings in middle schools in the past were that students had too much mobility, were recruited and transferred at any time, and the school became a cadre "supply station" and "distribution center" for various departments. In the past two years, Jizhong No. 1 Middle School has transferred a total of more than 1,500 students, of which more than 80 students only stayed in school for one week. The longest study time for students did not exceed one year. No. 4 Middle School was transferred 18 times last year, and in March this year, 127 students were transferred out in 9 times in 25 days. Jin Yu Middle School in Taiyue often had only more than 100 students last year, but the number of students transferred out throughout the year reached 209. As a result of such frequent transfers, schools were often busy with enrollment, class placement, and solving teaching difficulties, and could not implement education plans or cultivate students with a certain cultural and scientific level. Therefore, this conference clearly stipulated that the duration of study in junior high school is three years, and a one-year short-term middle school will be established to take care of the current urgent needs. Senior high schools will be established as needed and possible. The duration of study in teachers' colleges is three years, and one year for simplified teachers' colleges. Establish a scientific and reasonable examination system, and strictly control entrance, promotion, and graduation examinations. Students are not allowed to be transferred midway before the graduation deadline.

　　Establish a Formal School System
　　Overcome the View of Neglecting Culture

　　In adhering to the formal system, the conference believed that it is necessary to overcome the view of neglecting cultural learning. The conference specifically criticized the erroneous view in the past that emphasizing cultural learning would deviate from politics, or that it would be an old-fashioned formalization. It pointed out that cultural knowledge is a tool; when we master it, it is our weapon to fight against the enemy. Today, we do not have too much culture, but rather we have no culture or too little culture. Therefore, improving culture itself is a serious political task at present. In order to effectively strengthen cultural education, it is necessary to reduce students' social activities, productive labor, and reduce excessive political classes. The conference clearly stipulated that activities such as productive labor, student self-government, and social services should not exceed eight hours per week, and the task of production for public purposes should be abolished. Students participating in social activities, production, and acting with more than three days of class suspension must be approved by the competent authority before they can proceed. It is also stipulated that the actual class time per year shall not be less than 36 weeks. The conference believes that all methods that are effective in improving culture should be adopted. We cannot reject them all just because these methods were once adopted by old-fashioned schools, regardless of whether they are good or bad, or whether they meet our needs, and call them old-fashioned formalization.

　　The conference also reviewed the ideological and political education in middle schools, believing that although the ideological and political education in middle schools in the past has achieved certain results, there are too many portions, and there are shortcomings in the content and methods. No matter what class is taught, it must be linked to politics, and even the sun must be studied for its class nature. Too many political articles that are not easy for middle school students to understand were selected for Chinese language textbooks. History classes neglect historical facts and abstractly talk about the laws of historical development and lessons learned. As for the political class itself, it often instills students with abstract and empty nouns and terms, lacking specific and vivid content. In addition, the methods of struggle such as forced tracking of thoughts, introspection, and confession adopted in the life review meetings are also undesirable. The conference believes that the ideological and political education in secondary schools must be effectively improved in the future. The amount and content of political classes must be appropriately stipulated, and the method of forced struggle must be prohibited. The students' thoughts must be transformed with the method of true education.

　　Pay Attention to Classroom Teaching and Teacher Guidance
　　Individual Learning Supplemented by Collective Mutual Assistance

　　In terms of teaching, the conference believes that it is necessary to pay attention to classroom teaching and the guiding role of teachers. The content of education must be practical, and the methods of education must be linked to reality. Teachers should be good at setting an example, inducing and enlightening, so that the education plan can be transformed into students' conscious and automatic actions. Students should focus on individual learning, supplemented by collective mutual assistance. Under the spirit of collectivism, develop students' personality. The conference criticized the past abuse of collective learning, even mathematics classes required collective discussion, neglecting the importance of individual learning and individual efforts, and even thinking that "individual understanding does not count, only everyone's understanding counts." This is unreasonable. This conference stipulates that collective discussions should be limited to courses related to ideological education, and can only be held once a week.

　　Regarding the leadership of schools, the administrative offices and municipal governments should strengthen the leadership of the secondary schools under their jurisdiction. Administrative offices should strengthen inspection and guidance. Special administrative offices and county governments should help local schools solve difficulties. The school's internal leadership is the responsibility of the principal. The principal is responsible to the government for completing the tasks assigned by the government. After the direction of secondary education is determined, the teachers play a decisive role in the work. In the past, the living conditions of primary and secondary school teachers were too low, and they must be appropriately improved. At the same time, the political life and professional learning of teachers should be improved. The view of neglecting and excluding intellectuals is wrong and must continue to be corrected.

　　After repeated discussions and revisions, the conference unanimously approved the implementation measures for general middle schools and teachers' colleges, and the draft standards for the treatment of primary and secondary school teachers and staff. The attendees were very satisfied with the conference. Liu @, Director of the Education Department of the Jizhong Administrative Office, said: "This conference has solved problems that have not been solved for a long time. However, the implementation of the policy is not easy, and it is necessary to vigorously promote the creation of various places and prevent it from developing into rote learning." Gao Zhenwu, an old educator from Jilu Yu, who is 69 years old, said: "This time, all the past problems of the school have been corrected. Everyone has changed together, and I am very happy. Although I am old, I still want to work hard. I hope everyone will work hard and compete." Comrade Zhou Yang finally encouraged everyone that the conference has stipulated the direction and system of middle school education, and hoped that everyone would boldly create within the stipulated scope and make more achievements on the education work front.

### 纠正过去偏向确定今后方针　华北开中等教育会议

　　纠正过去偏向确定今后方针
  　华北开中等教育会议
    【本报特讯】华北中等教育会议，于八月二十五日在华北某地召开。会议历时十二日，于九月五日结束。会议根据目前人民解放战争与华北解放区建设的需要，重新检讨了普通中等教育的方针、性质与任务，规定了正规学制、课程等实施原则与办法，纠正了过去的混乱与偏向，统一了教育工作者的思想。最后并通过了中学与师范实施办法，中小学教职员待遇标准等草案，送呈华北政府审核，公布实行。
    会议前，太行、太岳、冀中、冀南、冀鲁豫各行署都先后举行过教育会议。北岳区虽未举行会议，也已作了召开会议的准备工作。据不完全的统计：全区六个行署区，一个市，共有中等学校（包括师范）一三八处，学生二三、○八四名，职业学校不在内。两年以来，有三六、一六八名学生分配工作，供给了战争与建设各方面的需要。华北中等教育是有成绩的，是对人民有贡献的。这是全体中学教职员与教育行政干部在人力物力极端困难的条件下艰苦奋斗的结果。但中等教育中也曾有不少缺点和偏向，首先是方针任务不明确，没有适应形势的发展，及时地克服中等学校在过去游击战争环境中所不可免的而且必要的训练班性质，而建立一定的必需的正规制度，没有足够地重视普通中学所必需的文化科学知识的基础教育。在土改与整党中又错误地把农村斗争的一套原封原样搬到学校中去，不少学校中也组织了贫农团，斗争地富，挤封建，分浮财，进行三查，并荒谬绝伦地提出什么“文化上填平补齐”“文化还农”“学生有其校”的口号，曾经一时地使学校陷于混乱状态。现在这种情况是已经纠正了。各行署针对这些情形在教育会议上作了检讨。太行着重检讨了所谓“职业化”的教育方针。冀中检讨了对知识分子的政策。各行署都一致检讨了中学教育中无制度、无计划、无纪律的现象，并初步提出了中等教育的实施办法。华北中等教育会议，是在这种基础上召开的。
    会议到各行署市教育行政负责人及中学师范校长代表四十余人。华北大学第二部主要教职员，也被邀参加。大会由前晋冀鲁豫教育厅长晁哲甫同志与前晋察冀教育处长刘皑风同志主持。中共华北中央局宣传部长周扬同志亲临指导大会。首由晁哲甫厅长作中等教育方针的报告，并提出中等教育实施办法等草案，交大会研究讨论。大会进行了详细的研讨，在讨论中周扬同志作了专门性的发言，使大会意见趋向了一致。
  　中学教育任务：为新民主主义国家培养具有中等文化水平及基本科学知识的人才
    大会明确指出了中学教育是普通教育性质。其任务是为新民主主义国家培养具有中等文化水平及基本科学知识的人才，使学生毕业后，经过一定专业训练，即能参加工作，或直接地参加工作，或继续升学深造，以适应各方面不同的需要。师范学校的任务，则是为新民主主义国家培养与提高小学师资及初级教育行政干部。大会检讨了过去对中学教育方针不明确，曾盲目地提倡所谓“职业化”，提倡“中心工作即中心课程”，不适当地强调“从作中学”，“从作中教”，致放松了甚至取消了普通中学应有的文化教育。例如豫北中学，就在这种方针下，学生走出了学校，组织三个工学团，到实际工作中去学习。一学期只教了三篇国文，也是当政治课讲的。结果，这些学生的工作能力，既不如当地的地方干部，学生的文化水平也得不到必要的提高。又由于财政困难，曾不适当地提出“以工养学”方针，致过分加重学生生产，学校成了“生产队”。许多学校，学生上不到一半时间的课。因此，学生文化水平低，成为普遍现象，遭到社会各方面的批评。学生本人也强烈要求学文化。但许多学校忽视了学生的这种正当要求，有的学校甚至反而叫学生去反省自己的什么“单纯文化观点”。今春许多学校招生单纯强调成份，有的学生入学考试，连自己名字的三个字都只会写两个。根据二十五个中学统计，今春新收学生，有一半不到高小毕业程度。小学也是这样，教员有的文化水平低，不能教学生识字，有的教学生去搞生产与社会活动，不教学生识字，群众反映说是“斗米一字”，说“八路军的学校好是好，就是不识字”。
    大会检讨了过去中等教育中无制度无计划的混乱现象，指出过去中学普遍存在的缺点是学生流动性太大，随招随调，学校变成了各部门的干部“供应站”“收发处”。冀中第一中学，两年以来，共调出学生一千五百余人，其中八十余人，入校只一个星期。学生学习时间最长的也超不过一年。第四中学，去年一年学生被调十八次，今年三月，二十五天中又调出学生九次，共一二七人。太岳晋豫中学去年经常只有一百多个学生，但全年调出的学生，即达二○九人。这样频繁抽调的结果，学校便经常忙于招生编班和解决教学的困难，无法实施教育计划，无法培养一定文化科学水平的学生。因此，这次会议明确规定初级中学修业期间为三年，为照顾目前的急需，设立一年制的短期中学。视需要与可能设立高中。师范学校修业期限为三年，简师为一年。建立科学合理的考试制度，严格入学、升学与毕业考试。学生未到毕业期限，不许中途抽调。
　　建立学校正规制度
    克服轻视文化观点
    在坚持正规制度中，大会认为必须克服轻视文化学习的观点。会议特别批评了过去那种认为强调文化学习就会脱离政治，或者就是旧型正规化的错误观点。指出文化知识是一种工具；掌握在我们手里，就是我们向敌人斗争的武器。今天我们不是文化太多，而是没有文化或文化太少了。因此，提高文化本身就是当前一个严重的政治任务。为了切实加强文化教育，必须减少学生的社会活动，生产劳动，减少过多的政治课。大会明确规定生产劳动、学生自治、社会服务等活动，每周不得超过八小时，生产缴公任务一律取消。学生参加社会活动、生产、演戏停课在三天以上者，必须经过主管机关批准，才能进行。并规定每年实际上课时间不得少于三十六周。大会认为凡在提高文化上有效的办法，都应该采用，不能因为这些办法，旧日学校曾经采用过就不分好坏，不管是否合乎我们需要，一律名之为旧型正规化，加以排斥。
    关于中学的思想政治教育，大会也进行了检讨，认为过去中学的思想政治教育，虽收到了一定成效，但是分量太多，内容与方法都有缺点。不管讲什么课，都要联系政治，甚至讲太阳也要研究它的阶级性。国文教材选了过多的为中学生所不易理解的政治性的文章。历史课则忽视历史事实，抽象地讲什么历史发展规律与经验教训。至于政治课本身又往往是灌输学生一些抽象空洞的名词术语，缺乏具体生动内容。还有生活检讨会上采取强制追思想反省坦白等斗争办法，也是要不得的，大会认为今后中等学校的思想政治教育必须切实加以改进，必须适当规定政治课的分量与内容，禁止采用强制斗争的方法，而用真正教育的方法，改造学生的思想。
　　重视课堂教学教师指导
    个人学习辅以集体互助
    在教学方面，大会认为必须重视课堂教学及教师的指导作用。教育内容必须切合实际，教育方法必须联系实际。教师应善于以身作则，诱导启发，使教育计划变成学生自觉自动的行动。学生应注重个人学习，辅以集体互助。在集体主义精神下，发展学生的个性。大会批判了过去滥用集体学习，什么课程甚至数学课都要集体讨论，而忽略了个人学习，个人努力的重要，甚至认为“个人会，不算会，大家会，才算会”，这都是不合理的。这次会议规定集体讨论应限于有关思想教育的课程，而且每周只能有一次。
    关于学校的领导方面，各行署市府对所管辖的中等学校应加强领导。行署要加强视察指导。专署县府要帮助所在地学校解决困难。学校内领导为校长负责制，由校长对政府负责，完成政府所交给的任务。中等教育方针确定之后，对工作起决定作用的是教员。过去中小学教员生活待遇太低，必须适当加以改善。同时应提高教员的政治生活与业务学习。轻视与排斥知识分子的观点，是错误的，必须继续加以纠正。
    经过会议反复讨论与修改，最后一致通过了普通中学与师范学校实施办法，及中小学教职员待遇标准等草案。到会人员对会议进行都是很满意的。冀中行署教育厅长柳＠说：“这次会议解决了长期没有解决的问题。但方针贯彻是不容易的，必须大力发扬各地的创造，防止发展为读死书”。冀鲁豫六九高龄的老教育家高镇五先生说：“这次把学校过去的毛病都改正过来，上下一齐改，心里很高兴。我虽然老了，还要干，希望大家努力竞赛”。周扬同志最后勉励大家，会议已规定了中学教育方针和制度，希望大家在规定的范围内大胆的去创造。在教育工作这条战线上作出更多的成绩来。
