　　Organizing Women to Work in the Fields
　　Taihang Area Balances Support for the Front and Production
　　[Taihang News] Since the spring plowing and summer harvest, a large number of able-bodied men in Jinzhong and Jindong districts have participated in the war effort. Shouyang County sent out four groups of civilian laborers from June 29th to July 8th. In the third district alone, one group sent 813 people, accounting for two-fifths of the district's labor force. In Wuxiang County, the labor force participating in the war effort accounted for about 40% of the total labor force. This has led to an extreme shortage of labor in various places. The local leadership has paid attention to mobilizing and organizing the vast number of women to work in the fields, and has timely completed the huge tasks of supporting the front and production.
　　Shouyang once put forward the slogan "Men participate in the war in the front, women produce in the rear." Various districts and villages also held women's meetings to mobilize them, breaking the historical concept of Shouyang women not being able to endure hardship and loving beauty, and organizing themselves freely to produce. For example, the four textile groups of 22 women under the leadership of Liu Shuanni, chairman of the women's association in Beichang, were also the weeding group during weeding. According to statistics from the first district, there are 136 women in the district who regularly carry large hoes to the fields. Xima Palm Village in the district planted a total of 1,050 mu of corn, and women hoed more than 600 mu. Twenty-one villages in Wuxiang organized 1,360 women to harvest 43,176 mu of wheat, equivalent to 2,699 male laborers, and weeded 822.6 mu, equivalent to 418 male laborers.
　　In mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production, various places have gained a lot of experience: (1) First of all, it is necessary to improve their awareness and break the backward idea that women think labor is shameful. (2) Educate women that if they want to strive for equality between men and women, they must first participate in labor and achieve self-reliance. If they are capable and economically independent, their political status can be improved. Li Xiangyun, a woman from Duancun Village in Wuxiang, said: "I used to think that equality between men and women just meant that men shouldn't beat you, and I still had no status at home. Since I started working in the fields this year, the family doesn't need to hire anyone, which saves food, and the men treat me better." (3) Resolve the confused thinking of women hero cadres and party members and make them actively play a leading role. (4) Solve the parasitic idea of ​​women being afraid of hardship and eating without working. In Beishanghe Village, Wuxiang, neither Han Futian's brothers are at home, only two women. Through this organization of women's labor, all the wheat in their family was harvested and all the seedlings were weeded. Shi Juying alone, in addition to pulling up 11 mu of seedlings and harvesting 5 mu of wheat in her family, earned 6 dou of wages. Now they are all happy to say: "We used to just want to eat ready-made food and were looked down upon. Now it's good, we can do the same work as men." (5) Adhere to the principle of voluntariness, free grouping, and separate organization. Some young women and old uncles are very restrained together, and their production results are not great. In equal exchange, implementing work-based calculation and fair scoring can consolidate women's organizations. The Linxiang group in Duancun Village, Wuxiang, had fixed points, and later the women's production enthusiasm declined and they did not go to production. After changing and determining the standard points, and then implementing fixed points and flexible work, the women became energetic. (6) Regularly broadcast the victory news from the front to women, strengthen women's confidence in victory, and encourage production enthusiasm. (7) Break the wrong view of men underestimating women and thinking that women are useless. For example, when Duancun organized women, no one wanted them. The men reflected: "It's nonsense to call women to the fields to work. Small feet make two holes in one step, and we have to fill them. They will trample the rice seedlings." The leadership explained with concrete facts. For example, the Duan Xiangyun group of seven women in the village harvested 70 mu of wheat a day, surpassing the men, and educated the whole village with their active work. Eighty-seven women were organized, and the original plan was to harvest wheat in six days, but it was completed in four days. The masses unanimously reflected: "This year, women participated in labor, harvesting wheat and weeding seedlings, which is really a big deal!"

### 组织妇女下地劳动　太行各地支前生产两不误

　　组织妇女下地劳动
  　太行各地支前生产两不误
    【太行讯】晋中晋东区自春耕夏收以来，各县均有大批全劳力参战，寿阳从六月二十九日开始到七月八日先后出征民工四批，仅三区一个组就走了八一三人，占全区劳力五分之二，武乡全县参战走的劳力占所有劳力的百分之四十上下，造成了各地劳力极端缺乏，各地领导上注意发动与组织广大妇女下地劳动，适时完成了支前与生产的巨大任务。
    寿阳曾提出“男人前方参战，女人后方生产”的口号，各区村并召开了妇女会议，进行动员，打破了寿阳妇女历史上不吃苦爱漂亮的观念，自由结合组织起来生产。如北昌妇女主席柳拴妮领导下的四个纺织组二十二人，锄苗时就是锄苗组。据一区统计，全区经常扛大锄上地的妇女有一三六人，该区吸马掌村共种一○五○亩玉茭，妇女就锄出六○○余亩。武乡二十一个村共组织一三六○个妇女，割麦子四三一七六亩，折合男劳力二六九九个，锄苗八二二·六亩，折合男人工四一八个。
    在发动妇女参加农业生产上，各地获得了不少经验：（一）首先要提高她们觉悟，打破妇女认为劳动丢人的落后思想。（二）教育妇女要想争取男女平等，首先必须参加劳动，做到自力更生。自己有本事，经济上独立，政治地位才能提高。武乡段村妇女李相云说：“我以前认为男女平等，只是男人不打就算，自己在家里仍无地位，自今年上地参加劳动，家中不用雇人了，节省了粮食，男人才对我好了。”（三）解决妇女英雄干部党员的混乱思想，使其积极的起带头作用。（四）解决妇女怕吃苦，穿汉吃汉的寄生思想。武乡北上合村，韩福田弟兄二人都不在家，只有两个妇女，经这次组织妇女劳动，他家的麦子全部收割完，青苗全部锄完。史菊英一个人，除拔了她家十一亩青苗，割了五亩麦子外，就赚了工资米六斗，现在她们都高兴的说：“以前咱们光想吃现成，被人家看不起，现在可好了，男人们能做的活，咱们同样能做。”（五）要坚持自愿原则，自由结组，并单独组织为好。有些青年妇女和翁翁大伯在一块，很受拘束，生产成绩不大。在等价交换上执行以活计工，评分公道，才能巩固妇女组织。武乡段村林香组，订的死分，以后妇女生产情绪低落，不去生产，经过改变确定了标准分之后，再死分活干，妇女才起了劲。（六）给妇女经常广播前线胜利消息，坚定妇女胜利信心，鼓舞生产情绪。（七）打破男人轻视妇女认为妇女不顶事的错误观点。如段村把妇女组织起来没人要，男人们反映：“叫妇女上地做活扯蛋，大脚板还不要紧，小脚一步两圪洞，还得咱填哩，把谷苗都给踏坏了。”领导上拿具体事实，进行解释。如该村段香云组七个妇女，一天割麦七十个，赛过了男人，用她们活的事实，教育了全村。组织了八十七个妇女，割麦子原计划六天割完，四天即完成了，群众一致反映：“今年妇女参加劳动，又割麦又锄苗，真顶了大事！”
