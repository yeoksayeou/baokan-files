[Jinzhong Electric] The phenomenon of "weak donkeys" in Yangqu is very serious, greatly impacting production and support for the front lines. In the First District, there were a total of 311 donkeys. Before supporting the front, 97 were already weak and 16 had died from illness. After sending 100 to support the front, another 42 became weak and 4 died from illness after returning home. Of the 380 donkeys sent out by the entire county in the first phase of support, 200 were lost due to illness, weakness, and other reasons. The reasons for the weak donkeys are: (1) The harvest was poor last year, and there was a shortage of fodder during this year's spring plowing. The alfalfa planted was mainly used for human consumption, neglecting the livestock. Since the start of summer, the drought has prevented grass from growing, resulting in many becoming ill and weak even before supporting the front. (2) Historically, loans and the distribution of livestock during last year's land reform were too dispersed, with almost everyone without livestock receiving a share. Some families received one head of livestock for every six households, and some even received one for every nine households. In many cases, ownership was not fixed during distribution, and the masses feared that well-fed animals would be taken away. Some received only "half a leg" [a small share], making it unusable in times of urgency, and even then they had to support the front, which was not worthwhile. (3) The burden of military service is unfair: those who raise livestock support the front, those who don't don't support the front; those who raise good livestock support the front more, those who raise poor livestock don't support the front. The military service accounts are not carefully settled, leading to unequal suffering and happiness. Consequently, people are unwilling to raise livestock, let alone raise good livestock. Some individual households even nailed nails into the hooves of their donkeys to avoid supporting the front. Zhao Huangfa from Liujialin in the Fifth District was unwilling to support the front and deliberately lamed his donkey. Chou Hou'er from Dananping in the Third District sold five jin of millet when his livestock became weak during support and returned with the saddle on his back. Some embezzled fodder during support to buy straw hats and tobacco, neglecting to feed the livestock. Others didn't want to go to support the front themselves, relying on others to bring them along or hiring people to drive them, etc. All of these can lead to livestock being poorly fed and becoming weak. After analyzing these reasons, the county has recently formulated measures to overcome the "weak donkey" problem: (1) Resolutely implement the military service burden regulations. In the past, county and district leaders believed that military service was not much and did not pay attention to implementing the military service burden policy. Most village cadres did not understand the calculation methods or settle accounts. It has now been decided to immediately print and distribute the military service calculation methods to the village level, with county and district cadres seriously leading the inspection, extensively reviewing the past advantages and disadvantages among the masses, and determining that in the future, people and livestock will be uniformly calculated as labor. Those who support more will earn wages according to the number of labor days they contributed, and those who support less or do not support will subsidize rice. Expose and overcome the selfishness of individual cadres and their unwillingness to implement the military service regulations, and establish a settlement system. The county will uniformly issue labor tickets or military service payment certificates. (2) Properly handle and determine the ownership of livestock. For the donkey shares of real loafers, the masses can withdraw them at a price, paying the price in installments or offsetting it with cultivated land. For the rest, if the donkeys are not well fed, and they are willing to be consolidated by one family or two or three families, they can be dealt with according to the correct opinions of the masses by pricing and returning labor. Clearly announce: No matter whether the livestock is loaned, from fruits, or from relief, whoever receives it owns it and must not be randomly withdrawn or moved. (3) After the cultivation is completed, mobilize the livestock-raising households to organize themselves to graze on the back mountains. (4) Commend and reward those who feed livestock well, criticize those who feed them poorly, and those who deliberately damage livestock and sabotage support for the front lines, and combine this with educating the masses to improve their understanding of the revolutionary struggle and their enthusiasm for supporting the front lines. (5) Overcome the bureaucratic leadership style of the front-line transportation teams, commend the leadership style of those who love livestock, go deep among the masses, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner.

### 支差不公平分配太零散　阳曲牲口大批病倒

　　支差不公平分配太零散
  　阳曲牲口大批病倒
    【晋中电】阳曲“乏驴”现象十分严重，对生产支前影响很大。一区共毛驴三一一头，支前以前即乏下九七头，病死十六头；支前去了一百头，又乏下四二头，回家后病死四头。全县第一期出去支前的三八○头，因病、乏等原因减少了二百头。乏驴原因：（一）去年收成不好，今年春耕时草料缺，种的苜蓿只顾人吃，顾不得喂牲口。入夏以来，天旱草不长，在支前以前就病乏很多。（二）历年贷款及去年土改分配牲口太分散，凡没牲口的都有份。有六户分一头的，还有九户分一头的。分配时有很多没固定所有权，群众怕喂好拉走，有的分下了半条腿，紧时用不上，支前还得跟着，不合算。（三）军勤负担不公，养牲口支前，不养牲口不支前，养好牲口多支前，养坏牲口不支前。不认真结算军勤帐，苦乐不均，因之大家不愿意养牲口，更不愿养好牲口。有个别户竟把驴蹄子上钉上钉子，躲避支前。五区刘家林赵黄发不愿意支前，故意将驴打拐。三区大南坪臭猴儿，支前中牲口乏下，卖了五斤小米，背上鞍子回来了。有的在支前中把草料贪污了买草帽、旱烟，不喂牲口。还有人自己不愿去支前，靠别人捎着赶或雇人赶等等。这些都会使牲口喂坏乏下。分析了这些原因，县上最近订出克服“乏驴”的办法：（一）坚决执行军勤负担条例。过去县区领导思想上认为军勤不多，没有注意贯彻军勤负担政策。村干部多数不懂计算办法，也不结算。现在决定即刻印发军勤计算办法，发至村级，县区干部认真领导检查，在群众中广泛检讨过去利弊，确定今后人、牲口统一算工。多支者按多支工数赚工资，少支不支者贴米。揭发并克服个别干部之自私与不愿执行军勤条例的思想，建立结算制度。由县统一制发工票或军勤支付证。（二）妥善处理和确定牲口的所有权。对真正二流子的驴股，群众要抽可以作价抽股，分期付价，或耕地顶价。其余凡驴没喂好，愿意一家或三二家归并者，可根据群众正确意见作价还工归并处理。明确宣布：不论是贷款或果实或救济的牲口，给了谁就是谁的，不得乱抽乱动。（三）耕种完后，发动喂牲口户组织起来到后山放青。（四）表扬奖励喂好牲口的，批评喂坏的，故意将牲口闹坏，破坏支前的，并结合教育群众，提高他们对革命斗争的认识与支前的积极性。（五）克服支前运输队领导上的官僚主义，表扬爱护牲口，深入群众，发现问题，及时解决的领导作风。
