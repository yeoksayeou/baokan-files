Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th. At the Northeast Workers' Representative Congress on the 14th of last month, Guo Linjun, a representative from Harbin, reported on the regulations for the production merit campaign in state-owned enterprises in the Northeast Liberated Area. Based on the experience of the production merit campaign in Harbin and other areas of the Northeast Liberated Area, he elaborated on several issues concerning production merit.

He said: Regular ideological education and ideological preparation before the start of the campaign are the political foundation of the merit campaign. The purpose of ideological preparation is to get through the thinking from the leadership to the masses, overcome incorrect views on production merit, and establish clear goals and understanding. The specific method is to adopt various forms of meetings, lectures, and discussions, going deep from point to surface to mobilize the masses ideologically. Regarding the issue of formulating production merit plans, he said: The formulation of production merit plans should be based on the administrative production tasks of the enterprise, which is a guarantee for completing or exceeding the administrative production tasks. When making plans, it is first necessary to grasp production standards, which is a basic link in making plans, because the level of production standards will affect the smooth development of the merit campaign. In order to grasp the standards, leading cadres must delve into the business, study technology, and understand the situation. When making plans, the leadership should grasp the key points of the enterprise departments, find typical examples, and personally lead the work. Regarding the organization and leadership of the merit campaign, he put forward several issues that should be paid attention to in the leadership: First, pay attention to the fact that the production merit campaign should take improving production quantity and quality as the starting point; second, the merit campaign is a broad mass movement, and should make "everyone can achieve merit, everything can achieve merit." Whether workers and staff, technical and non-technical personnel, leading cadres and the masses, masters and apprentices, those who have special performance in any work can achieve merit, and pay attention to the fact that employees with regular work also have the opportunity to achieve merit, so as not to become a trophy movement for only a few people; third, establish various systems, such as reporting and commendation system, inspection system, merit evaluation and merit list system, reward system, etc.; fourth, pay attention to avoid overusing the enthusiasm of the masses, protect the health of employees, and avoid engaging in temporary sprints and desperation, while paying attention to transforming lazy people in the production merit; fifth, the leadership should pay attention to grasping materials, not burying real achievements, and further studying production standards to gradually improve production standards; sixth, regularly summarize experience, enrich the content of the merit campaign, and improve the movement.

Finally, Guo Linjun also explained the general spirit of the merit campaign, the standards and types of heroes, what are the standards for production merit, the merit evaluation organization, the merit evaluation method, the merit evaluation principles, the commendation and reward of merit, and the emergence of labor heroes in production.

　　郭林军在东北职代大会报告
  　企业生产立功运动条例
    【新华社东北九日电】上月十四日东北职工代表大会中由哈市代表郭林军报告东北解放区公营企业中生产立功运动条例。他根据哈尔滨市及东北解放区其他地区生产立功运动的经验，阐述了关于生产立功中的几个问题。
    他说：平时的思想教育与运动开始的思想酝酿，是立功运动的政治基础。而思想酝酿的目的，是要从领导上到群众打通思想，克服对生产立功的不正确看法，树立明确的目的和认识。其具体办法是采取各种形式的会议，讲解、讨论，从点到面的深入下去，使群众在思想上动员起来。关于制订生产立功计划问题，他说：制定生产立功计划要根据企业行政生产任务来进行，这是完成或超过行政生产任务的保证。在订计划时首先要掌握生产标准，这是订计划的基本环节，因生产标准的高低会影响立功运动的顺利开展。为了掌握标准，领导干部要深入业务，研究技术，了解情况。在订计划时，领导上要掌握企业部门的重点，找典型，亲自动手领导去作。关于立功运动的组织领导，他提出了在领导上应该注意的几个问题：一、注意生产立功运动，应以提高生产数量与质量为出发点；二、立功运动是广泛的群众性的运动，应使“人人能立功，事事能立功”，不论工人与职员，技术与非技术者，领导干部与群众，师傅与徒弟，在任何工作上有特殊表现者都可立功，并注意有经常性工作的职工，亦有立功的机会，这样才不致成为单只少数人的锦标运动；三、建立各种制度，如汇报与表扬制度，检查制度，评功加功劳榜制度，奖励制度等；四、在生产立功中注意不要过度使用群众的积极性，保护职工健康，避免只从事一时的突击和拼命主义，同时注意改造懒汉；五、领导上注意掌握材料，不埋没真实功劳，进一步研究生产标准，达到逐渐提高生产标准；六、经常总结经验，充实立功运动的内容，使运动提高一步。
    最后郭林军将立功运动的总精神，功臣标准与种类，生产立功有什么标准，评功组织，评功方式，评功原则，功劳之表扬与奖励及生产中的劳动英雄的产生等问题，亦作了解释和说明。
