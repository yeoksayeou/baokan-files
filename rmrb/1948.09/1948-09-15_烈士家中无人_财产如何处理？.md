    What Happens to the Property of a Martyr's Family When There is No One Left?
    To the Editor:
        There are a few issues I am unclear about, please reply:
        1.  When classifying class status, there was a household where, at the start of the War of Resistance, there were two laborers. One went to Taiyuan as a foreman and did not participate in labor himself; the other participated in revolutionary work. In 1938, the household hired a long-term laborer, which only stopped during the land reform in 1947. This household has 18 mu of land and six people. Except for the one participating in the work, there are no laborers in the family. Can hiring a long-term laborer for ten years be considered a middle peasant? The masses say he relies entirely on exploiting labor to live; is it correct to classify him as a rich peasant?
        2.  There is a martyr's family with no one left. The woman remarried and took away half of the property. Who should cultivate the remaining land? Is it considered abandoned land? The masses are discussing whether it is appropriate to leave it to a close relative of the martyr's family to cultivate, in honor of the warrior's merits. How should the houses and movable property be handled?
        3.  In six villages including Sitou Village in Pingshun County, there is a large temple that was transferred to the county's public property last year. The masses lack housing and are requesting distribution. Can it be returned to the masses?
        (Yang Haizhong, Wang Tianfu, Pei Chengsuo)
    Answer: (1) This household has six people and 18 mu of land. There are two laborers, one working as a foreman outside (the foreman's income cannot be considered feudal exploitation) and one participating in revolutionary work outside. Because there is no labor force, they hire workers to cultivate the land, which should not be considered exploitation. At the same time, the land averages only three mu per person, which is probably at the level of a general middle peasant. Therefore, this household is not a landlord or rich peasant, but a middle peasant.
    (2) The martyr's merits should be commemorated and praised by the government, but since there is no one left in the family, if the deceased has legal heirs, their land, houses, and movable property can be inherited by their heirs. Otherwise, the masses should discuss how to handle it, and it is best to use it for village public welfare.
    (3) Larger temple buildings, especially places of historical interest, should be handled by the county or higher-level government.

### 烈士家中无人　财产如何处理？

专栏：答复与问询

　　烈士家中无人
  　财产如何处理？编辑同志：
    有几个弄不清的问题，请答复：
    一、划阶级中有一户，抗战开始，家中有两个劳力，一个到太原当工头，自己不参加劳动；一个参加了革命工作，家中在二十七年雇长工一个，到四六年土改才停止了。这一户有十八亩土地，六口人，除参加工作的，家里没有劳力。雇长工十年能否算中农？群众说他全靠剥削劳力生活；是富农成份对不对？
    二、有一户烈属，家没别人；女人改嫁带走一半财产，留下的地该归谁种？是否算绝户地？群众讨论为了战士功绩，给他亲本家留下耕种，是否合适呢？房屋浮财等如何解决？
    三、平顺县寺头等六个村伙有一个大庙，去年归了县公产，群众缺房屋住，要求分配是否能归群众？
    （杨海忠、王天福、裴成锁）
    答：（一）这户六口人十八亩地，有两个劳动力，一个在外当工头（工头收入不能算是封建剥削），一个在外参加革命工作，因无劳力而雇工耕种，不得认为是剥削行为。同时土地平均仅三亩，可能在一般中农水平，故该户不是地主富农，而是中农。
    （二）烈士的功绩应由政府纪念表扬，但家中已无人，本人如有法定继承人，其土地房屋浮财可由其继承者继承，否则应让群众讨论处理，最好作为村公益事业之用。
    （三）较大的庙房，尤其是名胜古迹，应由县或县以上政府处理。
