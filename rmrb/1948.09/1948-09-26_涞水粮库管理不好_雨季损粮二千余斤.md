【North Yue Electric】The Laishui County Finance Section inspected the granaries in each district during the rainy season and found that a total of 1,870 jin of millet, 300 jin of corn, 300 jin of white flour, and 5,500 jin of public grass had rotted or become infested with insects in six districts. In addition, 100 jin of millet had been stolen. The reasons for these losses are: (1) Some district leaders were guilty of bureaucracy and their work was not thorough. For example, the Seventh District once reported "inspecting the Zijingguan Granary several times in the rain," but the specific inspection this time revealed that 1,200 jin of millet had gone bad. (2) Some district cadres did not pay enough attention to financial and grain work, considering it to be the job of the finance department and adopting an attitude of indifference. (3) Some districts neglected leadership in financial and grain work, allowing finance assistants to do other administrative work. For example, the county discovered that more than 300 jin of white flour had spoiled in the Yushanpu Granary of the Seventh District, and immediately notified the district finance assistant to go and inspect it as soon as possible. However, the assistant was doing other work in another village and did not go to inspect it. (4) Villages or cadres who managed the granaries well were not promptly commended, and those who did poorly were not criticized or punished.

　　涞水粮库管理不好
  　雨季损粮二千余斤
    【北岳电】涞水县财政科在雨季期间检查各区粮库，发现六个区共霉烂、生虫坏小米一千八百七十斤，玉米三百斤，白面三百斤，公草五千五百斤；另外偷盗小米一百斤。造成这些损失的原因：（一）有的区领导上犯了官僚主义，工作不深入。如七区曾报告“冒雨检查紫荆关粮库数次”，经此次具体检查结果，即坏了小米一千二百斤。（二）有些区干部对财粮工作不够重视，认为是财政部门的工作，采取漠不关心的态度。（三）有的区忽视财粮工作的领导，让财政助理作其他事务工作。如县里发现七区玉山铺粮库发坏了白面三百多斤，即通知该区财政助理赶快亲去检查，结果因在外村做其他工作，竟没有去检查。（四）对粮库保管好的村庄或干部没有及时加以表扬，坏的也没有加以批评或处分。
