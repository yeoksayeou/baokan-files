　　Agricultural Tax Should Be Levied Based on Normal Yield

Comrades Editors:

　　The spirit conveyed by the district this year is to levy the same amount based on the average yield per mu in homogeneous areas, without increasing the tax for those with higher yields, as an incentive for production. However, in this village where land reform is not thorough, the amount of land is similar, but the quality differs significantly. This reward for production largely benefits landlords and rich peasants who were not thoroughly struggled against.

　　The poor peasant association has raised several points: First, within homogeneous areas, landlords and rich peasants have years of deep plowing and fertilization, while poor peasants and hired laborers lack draught animals and the ability to cultivate intensively. Second, those with oxen can plant early and have higher yields; those without oxen plant late and have lower yields. Third, within homogeneous areas, yields vary from one plot to another. If we proceed according to the original spirit, it will be difficult to convince the poor and hired laborers.

　　Based on the opinions reflected above, and in conjunction with the specific research of village cadres, we have come up with a flexible approach: to divide the average land quality (wheat land) of each household into three different grades (not based on class composition), but in this way, landlords and rich peasants, as well as a few village cadres who have turned over too quickly, are placed in the first grade, middle peasants in the second grade, and poor peasants and below in the third grade. The tax per mu for each grade is allocated according to the total wheat tax task of the village. Apart from this, other principles and methods are carried out according to the district's arrangements.

　　After this preliminary arrangement was reported to the district, the district official in charge believed that the grading was based on class composition. He said this was a violation of principles and ordered immediate correction. He also told us to study the Border Region Government's wheat tax work instructions (People's Daily No. 4). After reading it, I believe that there are differences between the Jinnan and Jizhong areas in terms of land reform work, and in areas where the struggle is not thorough, such wheat taxation may not be reasonable for both the landlord/rich peasant and poor/hired laborer classes. We were told to correct it immediately, and since it was said to be a violation of principles, we had no choice but to correct it. However, the poor and hired laborers have the above opinions, and we have made the above decision. Please provide a solution and instructions!

　　In addition, regarding the party rectification issue: After we arrived in the village, we divided the party member cadres and non-party cadres into two groups and conducted the rectification separately. Later, the district party committee, after research, said that they should be mixed together. Apart from believing that mixed grouping can concentrate the opinions of mass representatives and reduce the number of leading comrades, we do not understand the other spirit. Please also introduce the advantages of mixed grouping in various places to us for reference.

　　Answer: Regarding the burden issue, we have asked the Department of Finance to reply as follows:

　　It is correct to calculate the burden of land based on normal annual yield in order to reward production. One cannot divide classes in rewarding production just because land reform is not thorough. Doing so will cause some people to be passive in production and affect production. The burden should serve the interests of developing production.

　　Regarding the many difficulties of peasants who have turned over in production, we must pay attention to helping solve them in supporting farmers' production. For example, mutual aid and loans should especially take into account the difficulties of newly turned-over peasants. However, one cannot divide grades when calculating the burden. Doing so will not only increase the burden on "landlords and rich peasants" who have not been thoroughly struggled against, but also increase the burden on middle peasants. This is still the mistake of a pure poor peasant and hired laborer perspective. One of the five specific policies of uniting with the middle peasants as stipulated by Chairman Mao is that the burden should be fair and reasonable and should not harm the middle peasants. After the poor peasants have turned over, we should pay great attention to helping them solve their difficulties, but we cannot expect them to have the same production base or the same harvest as other middle peasants or well-to-do middle peasants all at once. This is impossible. On this point, we should conduct a good explanation and persuasion of the poor and hired laborers.

　　Regarding the issue of party rectification, party rectification is only for party members, so party member cadres and non-party cadres should not be mixed together. In order to make the party rectification open and facilitate the absorption of the opinions of the masses, mass representatives and non-party cadres can be invited to attend branch party rectification meetings. As for criticism of non-party cadres, it should generally be conducted at the village people's representative meeting or village government meeting.

### 农业税应按常年产量征收

专栏：询问与答复

　　农业税应按常年产量征收编者同志：
    今年区里布置的精神，在同质地区以每亩平均产量等量征收，而多产者不多收，这是为奖励生产。但在土改不彻底的这个村，土地数量相差不多，而质量则有显著的差别，这样奖励生产大都奖励了斗的不彻底的地富了。
    贫农团提出了几个意见：一、在同质地区内的土地，地富有多年的深耕、肥大，而贫雇则多年缺乏耕牛，无力精耕细作。二、有牛可以早种，产量多；没牛则晚种产量即少。三、在同质地区范围内，这一块与那一块产量也有不同。若按原精神作下去打不通贫雇阶层的思想。
    我们根据以上反映的意见，结合村干具体研究出灵活办法是：按每户的平均地质（麦地）划分为三个不同的等级（不是以阶级成份划分），但这样划清，无形中地富及翻身过高的个别村干列为一等，中农列为二等，贫农以下为三等，各级每亩所征数，按全村麦征任务数字，分别分配。除此外其他原则办法等均按区里布置进行。
    按这样初步布置汇报区后，区负责同志认为划分等级是以阶级成份划分的。说这是违犯原则了，叫立即纠正。并叫我们研究边府麦征工作指示（人民日报第四号），我看了后，认为冀南和冀中等区域在土改工作上是有区别的，而象这斗争不彻底的地区，那样麦征恐对地富及对贫雇两阶级不易合理，而叫立即纠正，并说是违犯原则，我们只有纠正。但贫雇群众有上述意见，我们有过上述决定，请给解答指示！
    另外关于整党问题：我们到村后是将党员干部与非党干部分编两组，同时分别进行的。后区委研究后，说应混合编组进行。我们除认为混编后，可使群众代表集中意见及减少领导同志外，其他的精神，领会不到。亦请把各地混编的优点介绍给我们作参考。

    答：关于负担问题，我们已请财政厅答复如下：
    为了奖励生产，土地按常年应产量计算负担，这是对的，不能因为土地改革不彻底，而在奖励生产上划分阶级。这样做的结果会造成某些人生产上的消极，而影响生产，负担是应当服从发展生产的利益的。
    关于翻身农民生产上的许多困难，我们在扶植农民生产上，必须注意帮助解决。如组织互助、贷款都应特别照顾新翻身农民的困难。但不能在计算负担时划分等级，这样做，不仅加重未斗透的“地主富农”的负担，也将加重中农负担。这还是单纯的贫雇观点的毛病。毛主席所规定的团结中农的五项具体政策中，就有一条是负担公平合理，不要伤害中农，在贫苦农民翻身以后，我们应该予以极大注意帮助解决他们的困难，但也不能要求他们一下子通通都与其他中农或富裕中农有一样的生产基础，一样的能收到同等的收获量，这是做不到的。在此点上，应对贫雇农进行很好的解释说服。
    关于整党问题，整党是只对党员进行的，故不应将党员干部与非党干部混合编组进行。为了公开整党，便于吸收群众的意见，支部开整党会议时可邀请群众代表、非党干部参加。至于对非党干部的批评，一般应在村人民代表会或村政府会议上进行。  　　　　　　——编者
