Xinhua News Agency, North China, August 31st: The following is an abstract of Dong Biwu's opening speech at the North China Provisional People's Representative Conference on August 7th:

Comrade Representatives,

Our North China Provisional People's Representative Conference has now opened. It is provisional and also regional to North China. However, it will become a prelude and prototype for the National People's Congress. Therefore, it is a landmark conference in the history of the Chinese democratic revolution and will occupy a glorious chapter in the history of the Chinese democratic revolution.

People say that the 20th century is the century of the people. Before the 20th century, history was always about a minority ruling the majority, a minority exploiting the majority. In capitalist countries, the bourgeoisie often used the democratic system as a guise to deceive the people. The democracy they talked about was the democracy of the old democracy, which in reality was still a minority ruling the majority of the people. After the victory of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, the Soviet working people overthrew the old rule, abolished the system of exploitation, and the people truly stood up, managed their own affairs, and truly realized the most thorough democracy. Afterwards, the people of various countries were influenced by the victory of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union and rose up in revolution one after another. The people of many countries seized power and established new democratic systems. The establishment of new people's power is a political feature of the 20th century.

Our current People's Representative Conference precisely fits the statement that the 20th century is the century of the people.

American imperialism often calls itself the "most democratic" country in the world. However, some universities in the United States do not even allow lectures on Darwin's theory of evolution. Black people and white people cannot only not live in the same place, but they cannot even ride in the same car, and even the white people's toilets are not allowed for black people to enter. Only a very small number of black people have the right to vote. Because black people account for the majority in Washington, the mayor has to be appointed by the government, and they dare not have him elected by the people. For example, the British election law stipulates that candidates must have a certain amount of cash as a guarantee. If the number of votes obtained does not reach the legal number, this cash will be confiscated; if the candidates cannot provide the legal cash, they cannot become candidates. Capitalist countries use these many methods to restrict and deprive the people of their democratic rights.

And our representative conference, although temporary and regional, does not discriminate against race, belief, or gender. Not only do we have representatives of the Hui people participating in our conference, but we also have representatives of the Hui people elected to the presidium. There are many women representatives, and there is also a female chairman in the presidium. The presidium also includes representatives of workers, representatives of peasants, representatives of industrialists and businessmen, representatives of students, representatives of the army, representatives of political parties, non-party social elites, and representatives of enlightened gentry. The people's right to elect is fully respected. Our democratic system is far superior to the democratic system of capitalist countries. As for the Kuomintang reactionary ruling group's pseudo-"National Assembly" convened on March 29th this year, it is notorious and full of ugly behaviors, and it is not worth comparing it with our People's Representative Conference.

In the past, our liberated areas also held senates, but they were very different from this representative conference. First of all, the names are different, secondly, the composition of the members is different, and the powers of the meetings are also different.

Our People's Representative Conference shows that the regime in our liberated areas is a revolutionary regime, a people's regime, and a new democratic regime. It is roughly similar to some democratic countries in Eastern Europe such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Albania. These countries solved the land problem after the war, eliminated fascism, and united to establish their people's regimes, new democratic regimes. Some of these countries have begun to embark on socialism. But as far as East Asia is concerned, it is our representative conference that has the form of a new democratic regime.

Now we can hold such a People's Representative Conference, which has certain conditions. First of all, our North China Liberated Area has basically completed the land reform. People in North China who had no land or very little land in the past have now been allocated land that roughly averages the number of acres per capita in the local area; the landlord class that monopolized the land in the past no longer exists, feudal exploitation has been eliminated, the relations of production have changed, the countryside has a new look, and the peasants have obtained a basis for a better life than before. Without this condition, even if we wanted to hold such a People's Representative Conference, it would be impossible.

Secondly, there is the victory of the Liberation War. The situation in the North China Liberated Area has changed in the two years of war. In the past, this vast area was divided by the enemy. But after our army victoriously controlled the Zhengtai Railway and liberated Shijiazhuang and the surrounding county towns, the area of thousands of miles in North China was completely united. Our Liu Deng, Chen Xie, and Chen Su armies went south, pushing the Liberation War to the Kuomintang-controlled areas and victoriously opening up the Central Plains Liberated Area. The victorious offensives of our Northeast, East China, Northwest, and North China North and South Line Corps made the Kuomintang bandit army completely passive. This allows our North China Liberated Area to be less affected by the war and to vigorously engage in production and construction. Without the condition of war victory, it would be impossible to hold such a People's Representative Conference. Winning this condition is the result of the efforts of all the compatriots in North China, the result of the efforts of the compatriots in the liberated areas, especially the Liberation Army commanders and fighters and the rear service personnel who worked hard and sacrificed blood. In order to commemorate the heroic martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the front and rear, I ask all the representatives of the conference to stand in silence for three minutes to express our condolences to them! (All representatives stood in silence for three minutes.) In order to express the joy of the people of North China in gaining liberation, I propose that the conference, in its name, pay sincere and warm respect to Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and the Liberation Army commanders and fighters and rear service personnel led by them! (Loud applause)

This conference will resolve the major current tasks in North China. The Jin-Chahar-Hebei Administrative Committee and the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government will report to the conference. The governments of these two regions have made their best efforts in the past war environment to lead the people to support the war, complete land reform, and achieve their historical mission. They have laid a good working foundation, which enables us to engage in broader political, economic, and cultural construction on this basis. Of course, North China has not completely gotten rid of the impact of the war, and all kinds of construction should still focus on supporting the war and striving for victory. Therefore, at this conference, we must formulate the future government's policies, discuss the work reports of the two border region governments, some basic policies, the organization of the new government, and the proposals of the government and representatives. These tasks must be completed within the schedule set by the conference. We have been entrusted by the people of North China, and we will certainly be able to achieve our goals and complete our tasks.

Let us hold high the banner of New Democracy and advance by leaps and bounds on the basis of our achieved victories! Long live the new people's China! Long live the new democratic China! (Loud applause)

### 在华北临时人民代表大会上　董必武同志致开幕词

　　在华北临时人民代表大会上
  　董必武同志致开幕词
    【新华社华北三十一日电】董必武八月七日在华北临时人民代表大会上的开幕词摘要如下：各位代表先生：
    我们华北临时人民代表大会已经宣布开幕了，它是一个临时性的，而且也是华北一个地区的。但是，它将成为全国人民代表大会的前奏和雏型。因此它是中国民主革命历史中划时代的一次大会，在中国民主革命历史上将占有光荣的篇幅。
    人们说：二十世纪是人民的世纪。在二十世纪前，历史都是少数人统治多数人，少数人剥削多数人，资本主义国家内资产阶级常用民主制度作幌子，来欺骗人民。他们所说的民主，是旧民主主义的民主，实际仍是少数人统治着大多数的人民。到了苏联十月革命胜利，苏联劳动人民推翻了旧的统治，废除了剥削制度，人民才真正翻了身，自己管理自己的事，真正实现了最彻底的民主。以后各国人民受了苏联十月革命胜利的影响，纷纷起来革命，有许多国家人民夺取了政权，建立起来了新的民主制度。崭新的人民政权的建立，是二十世纪政治上的特色。
    我们现在的人民代表大会，正适应了二十世纪是人民的世纪这句话。
    美帝国主义经常自称为世界上“最民主”的国家。但美国有的大学竟不准讲达尔文的进化论。黑人与白人不仅不能在一块地方居住，而且不能同乘一辆汽车，甚至于白人的厕所也不许黑人进去。黑人中只有极少数人有选举权。华盛顿因黑人占大多数，因此市长只好由政府委派，而不敢经人民选举。再如英国选举法规定候选人要有一定数量的现金作保证，如得票未达到法定数目，这笔现金就被没收了；竞选人如果不能提供法定的现金，也就不能成为候选人。资本主义的国家就是用这许许多多方法限制和剥夺了人民的民主权利。
    而我们这个代表会，虽然是临时的、一个地区的，但是没有种族、信仰、性别的歧视，我们大会不但有回民代表参加，而且还有回民代表被选入主席团。妇女代表很多，主席团中也有女主席。主席团中还有工人代表、农民代表、工商业者代表、学生代表、军队代表、党派代表、无党无派社会贤达、开明绅士的代表等。人民的选举权利受到充分的尊重。我们的民主制度比起资本主义国家的民主制度是优越得多。至于国民党反动统治集团在今年三月二十九日召开的伪“国大”，臭名远扬，丑态百出，不值得把它拿来和我们的人民代表大会相比拟。
    过去，我们各解放区也举行过参议会，但跟这次的代表大会有很大的不同。首先是名义的不同，其次是构成分子不同，会议的职权也不同。
    我们这个人民代表大会，表现了我们解放区的政权是革命的政权、是人民的政权、是新民主主义的政权。它大体上与东欧一些民主国家如波兰、捷克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利及阿尔巴尼亚等相近似。这些国家在战后解决了土地问题，消灭了法西斯，并团结起来建立了他们的人民政权、新民主主义的政权。其中有的国家已开始走上社会主义。但就东亚来说，具有新民主主义政权形式的，也就是我们这一个代表大会。
    现在我们能开这样一个人民代表会，是有其一定条件的。首先是我们华北解放区已基本上完成了土地改革。华北过去没有土地或很少土地的人们，今天都分得了照当地人口大体上平均亩数的土地；过去垄断土地的地主阶级已不存在了，封建剥削扫除了，生产关系改变了，农村的面貌一新，农民得到了比以前生活优裕的基础。没有这个条件，我们纵然想开这样一个人民代表大会，也是不可能的。
    其次是解放战争的胜利。华北解放区在两年战争中已改变了它的形势。过去这一广大地区被敌人分割着。但经我军胜利的控制了正太路，解放了石家庄及其周围的几座县城以后，华北纵横千里的地区就完全打成一片了。我刘邓、陈谢、陈粟大军南下，把解放战争推向国民党统治区，胜利的开辟了中原解放区。我东北、华东、西北和华北南、北两线兵团的胜利进攻，使国民党匪军完全处于被动。这就使我华北解放区少受战争影响，可以大力从事生产建设。没有战争胜利这个条件，要想开这样一个人民代表大会也是不可能的。赢得这个条件，是全华北同胞努力的结果，是各解放区同胞努力的结果，特别是解放军指战员、后方的参战人员戮力奋斗，不顾牺牲流血的结果。为了纪念前后方英勇牺牲的烈士，我请大会代表诸先生起立静默三分钟向他们致哀！（全体代表肃立静默三分钟。）为了表示华北人民获得解放的庆幸，我提议用大会名义向中国人民领袖毛泽东、朱德总司令及其所率领的解放军指战员和后方参战人员致诚恳热烈的敬意！（大鼓掌）
    这次大会将要解决华北当前的重大任务。晋察冀行政委员会及晋冀鲁豫边区政府将向大会作报告。这两区的政府在过去战争环境下，尽了他们最大的努力，领导人民支援战争，完成土地改革，达成了他们所负的历史使命。奠定了优良的工作基础，使我们可能在这一基础上从事更广大的政治、经济、文化诸般建设。当然，华北地区还没有完全摆脱战争的影响，各种建设仍应以支援战争、争取胜利为主。因此在这次大会上我们必须订出将来政府的施政方针，讨论两边区政府工作报告，某些基本政策，新政府的组织，以及政府和各代表的提案等。这些工作都要在大会规定的日程内完成。我们已受华北人民的付托，我们一定能够达到目的，完成任务。
    我们高举起新民主主义的旗帜，在既得胜利的基础上，大踏步前进！新的人民的中国万岁！新民主主义的中国万岁！（大鼓掌）
