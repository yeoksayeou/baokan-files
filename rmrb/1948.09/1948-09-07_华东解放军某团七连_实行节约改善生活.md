Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 31st - The Seventh Company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army gave a typical report on improving living standards and methods of thrift at the National Supply Training Class. All comrades engaged in administrative work unanimously agreed that the Seventh Company is a good example for the whole country. Its main characteristic is that the comrades in the kitchen can consciously and proactively think of ways to save money and improve the company's life within the supply standards. The Seventh Company first convened a meeting of kitchen cadres, party members, and activists to explain that Shandong was experiencing food difficulties due to looting by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, especially in areas that had undergone combat, where many ordinary people were eating wild herbs and tree leaves. Therefore, improving living standards should not exceed the system's requirements, and waste should be opposed in order to save food for disaster relief. Then, all the comrades in the company were mobilized to ensure that not a single grain of rice was lost and not a single extra blade of grass was burned.

　　After the meeting, the kitchen precisely calculated how much firewood was needed to cook a meal and boil a pot of water, and split the firewood and sorghum stalks to burn in order to save fuel. When the platoons needed grass to boil water for ironing clothes, the kitchen feared waste and personally burned the water for them, or used the water from steaming steamed buns to iron clothes. The kitchen comrades also personally delivered boiling water and lamp oil to the platoons to avoid waste. Therefore, the entire company was supposed to receive 455 catties of grass per day, but actually burned only 250 catties, saving 205 catties.

　　In the past, the leftover cold rice from the kitchen was distributed to the platoons. If the platoons didn't eat it, they would give the cold rice to the ordinary people and still go to the kitchen to ask for newly cooked food. After the kitchen found out, they kept the cold rice for themselves to eat. When the platoons saw that the kitchen often ate cold rice, everyone also scrambled to eat it and no longer gave it to the ordinary people privately, and the unity with the kitchen became closer. The kitchen also turned over the flour sacks after emptying them and swept them once, with each sack yielding two taels, saving a lot.

　　Many people were not used to eating pancakes made from sorghum flour, which resulted in waste. The kitchen then studied cutting the pancakes into small pieces and stewing them, or making noodles. The supply sergeant consulted with the kitchen when buying vegetables, asking about the platoons' reactions and which vegetables they liked to eat, and regularly sought the opinions of the economic committee member. The accounts were summarized every ten days and fully summarized every month, announced to the entire company, and pointed out any waste and savings during this period, so that the administration could mobilize everyone to correct them in time.

　　For the sick, the kitchen and the administration platoon leader personally delivered food and kindly asked them what they wanted to eat, doing their best to meet their needs. After one liberated comrade recovered from his illness, he automatically helped the kitchen carry water. He held the administration platoon leader's hand and said, "I owe my recovery to you. If I were in the Kuomintang, I would have died long ago."

　　After the Changwei Campaign, the kitchen secretly ironed and washed the soldiers' clothes and put forward the slogan: "No need for the platoons to carry grass or grain, so everyone can rest well and train."

　　In order to encourage the kitchen comrades, the administration platoon leader drew thirty-one towers, called the upgrade tower, to record each person's achievements, and everyone competed to see who could reach the top of the tower first.

### 华东解放军某团七连　实行节约改善生活

　　华东解放军某团七连
  　实行节约改善生活
    【新华社华东前线三十一日电】解放军某团七连，在全国供给训练班中作了关于改善生活与节约方法的典型报告，全体作事务工作的同志，一致认为七连是全国的好榜样。其主要特点是伙房同志能自觉和自动的积极想法节约，在供给标准内改善连队生活。七连首先召开了伙房干部、党员、积极分子会议，说明山东因受蒋匪抢劫造成粮食的困难，特别是经过战斗的地区，不少老百姓吃的是苦菜、树叶，因此改善生活不要超过制度以外，反对浪费，实行节约，省下粮食救济灾民。接着动员了全连同志，保证不丢一粒米，不多烧一根草。
    伙房经过会议后，精密的计算了做一次饭烧一锅水要用多少柴，并把木柴、高粱秸劈开着烧，以求节省。排里要草烧水烫衣服，伙房怕浪费，亲自代烧，或者利用蒸馒头水烫衣服。伙房同志又亲往排里送开水，送灯油，以免浪费。因此全连每日应领草四百五十五斤，而实烧仅二百五十斤，节约了二百零五斤。
    过去伙房剩的冷饭都分到排里，排里不吃，把冷饭送给老百姓，仍到伙房要新煮的吃，伙房知道了以后，就把冷饭留着自己吃，排里见伙房常吃冷饭，大家也就争着吃，再不私自给老百姓了，与伙房的团结也更密切起来。伙房并将装白面的干粮袋倒出后，翻过来扫一遍，一条能扫出二两，节省很多。
    高粱面子做的饼很多人吃不惯，因此产生了浪费现象，伙房就研究把饼切成小块烩着吃，或做面条吃。上士买菜都与伙房研究，排里有那些反映，爱吃那些菜，经常征求经济委员的意见。帐目是十天小结、一月大结，向全连公布，并指出在这一个时期有那些浪费与节约，行政上即时动员大家纠正。
    对于病号，伙房与管理排长亲自送饭，并亲切的问他们要吃什么尽可能做到，一位解放同志病好了后自动帮伙房挑水，他握着管理排长的手说：“我的病多亏你们，若在国民党那里早就死了。”
    昌潍战役后，伙房偷着把战士的衣服烫洗了，并提出口号：“不用排里搬草搬粮，叫大家休息好练兵。”
    管理排长为了鼓励伙房同志，并画了三十一个塔，名为升级塔，来记每个人的成绩，大家比赛谁能先达到最高的塔顶。
