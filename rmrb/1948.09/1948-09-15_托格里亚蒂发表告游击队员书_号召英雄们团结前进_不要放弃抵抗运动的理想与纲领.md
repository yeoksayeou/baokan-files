　　Togliatti Publishes Letter to Guerrilla Fighters
  　Calling on Heroes to Unite and Advance
    Do Not Abandon the Ideals and Program of the Resistance Movement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th] On the 8th of this month, guerrilla fighters of the Italian Resistance Movement held gatherings in Piedmont (on the Franco-Italian border) and other places to commemorate the "Resistance Movement Day" of the Italian people. Italian Communist leader Togliatti specially published a letter to the guerrilla fighters, which was read by Longo, the deputy commander of the "Volunteer Liberation Corps," at a grand commemorative meeting. The message stated in brief: It is extremely necessary for everyone to know that the ideals and leaders of the Resistance Movement are still alive in the hearts of the best sons and daughters of Italy. Our heroes – tens of thousands of our soldiers – demand the restoration of Italy's youth for the sake of freedom, justice, and work. Today's Italy, increasingly resembles the Italy of the fascist riots era, and is not the Italy that the people fought for and won in the name of the people. The message continued: Do not abandon your hope, because no one has ever been able to suppress a people determined to win justice and freedom for long. Let us be as determined and united as we were in the most difficult days of the war. The message concluded: For the democratic and socialist rebirth of our country, advance! Victory will ultimately belong to the working people of Italy!

　　托格里亚蒂发表告游击队员书
  　号召英雄们团结前进
    不要放弃抵抗运动的理想与纲领
    【新华社陕北十二日电】本月八日，意大利抵抗运动的游击队战士们在皮德蒙州（在法意边境）等地举行集会，纪念意大利人民的“抵抗运动日”。意共领袖托格里亚蒂特发表告游击队员书，由“志愿解放军团”副指挥隆哥在一盛大纪念会上宣读，该文告略称：一切人都应该知道抵抗运动的理想与领袖仍然活在意大利最优秀儿女的心里，这是万分必要的。我们的英雄们——成万的我们的战士，为了自由、正义与工作，要求恢复意大利的青春。今天的意大利，已是一个与法西斯暴乱时代越来越相象的意大利，并不是一个人民曾为它战斗而且以人民的名义赢得了胜利的意大利。文告继称：不要放弃你们的希望，因为从来没有人能够长期镇压决心赢得正义与自由的人民的，让我们象在战时最严重的日子一样，坚决和团结起来吧。文告结语称：为了我们国家的民主的与社会主义的新生，前进吧！胜利终究是意大利劳动人民的！
