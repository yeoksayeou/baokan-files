　　Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, is located on the fertile alluvial plain of the Yellow River in the northwest of the province, about ten miles north of the Yellow River. The city has a population of 700,000 and is situated at the junction of the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways. It is the largest city between Nanjing and Tianjin and plays a significant role in connecting China's north-south economy and culture. The city is divided into inner and outer cities. A commercial port was opened in the west of the city in the 30th year of the Guangxu reign (1904). Before the War of Resistance, commerce was quite prosperous. The urban area is lined with factories, and it is a major industrial city in Shandong along with Qingdao, with light and heavy industries such as flour, textiles, ironworks, papermaking, oil extraction, and leather making. The city has a well-developed education system and is the cultural center of Shandong Province, with four colleges and universities including the private Qilu University, the Provincial Medical College, the Normal College, and the Agricultural College, as well as twenty or thirty middle schools, with tens of thousands of students in the city. Jinan was the largest stronghold of the Kuomintang reactionaries in Shandong. The city was surrounded by three lines of permanent and strong defensive fortifications extending for dozens of miles, surrounded by numerous satellite strongholds, and defended by 100,000 heavily armed troops. However, in this offensive launched by the People's Liberation Army, the enemy's defense system completely collapsed after only eight days and nights of fighting, and the People's Liberation Army completely occupied the city. Jinan is the second provincial capital liberated by the People's Liberation Army in Guannei after Kaifeng. Its difference from Kaifeng is that it has been isolated in the encirclement of the liberated areas for a long time, so once it is liberated, it can be firmly owned by the people. After the liberation of Jinan, the Jinpu Railway, from Jinghai in the north to Lincheng north of Xuzhou in the south, is entirely controlled by the People's Liberation Army. The entire province of Shandong, with the exception of Qingdao, Yantai, and a few isolated strongholds in southern and southwestern Shandong, has been completely liberated. The two major liberated areas of Shandong and North China are also unobstructed. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　济南介绍
    济南为山东省省会，位于该省西北部黄河冲积的肥沃平原上，北距黄河约十里，全市人口七十万，地当津浦、胶济两铁路联结点，为南京、天津间的最大城市，对中国南北经济文化的联系上起着很大的作用。城分内外二城，清光绪三十年（一九零四年）在城西自辟商埠，抗战前商业颇为繁盛。市区工厂林立，与青岛同为山东的大工业城市，有面粉、纺织、铁工、造纸、榨油、制革等轻重工业。市内教育发达，为山东省文化中心，有私立齐鲁大学、省立医专、师范专科及农学院等四所专科以上学校，中学二、三十所，全市大中小学生数万人。济南为国民党反动派在山东的最大据点，城周数十里设有三道永久性的坚强防御工事，环以无数卫星据点，并有十万重兵防守。但此次人民解放军发起攻势，仅经八昼夜战斗，敌之防卫体系即全部土崩瓦解，解放军即全部占领该城。济南是关内的解放军继解放开封后所解放的第二座省会，其与开封的不同处，是它长期孤立于解放区的包围中，所以一经解放，便可以巩固地为人民所有。济南解放后，津浦路北起静海，南至徐州以北的临城，已全为解放军控制。山东全省除青岛、烟台和鲁南、鲁西南的少数孤立据点外，已全部解放。山东、华北两大解放区，亦已畅通无阻。（新华社）
