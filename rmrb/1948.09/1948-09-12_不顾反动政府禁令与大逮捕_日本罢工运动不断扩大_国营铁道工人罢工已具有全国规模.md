Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. TASS reports: Disregarding the reactionary government's strike ban and mass arrests, Japanese workers' strike movement and protest movement against the revision of the Civil Service Law are still expanding. The strike of Hokkaido National Railway workers has now spread to Honshu and Kyushu, and has become a national-scale strike. In Kyushu, in addition to the railway workers' strike, telecommunications workers have also stopped working, and metalworkers and miners are also preparing to strike. The strike of Hitachi postal workers has developed into a general strike. The wave of strikes in state-run enterprises is rapidly spreading to members of private enterprise labor unions, such as the All-Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union, the Steel Industry Workers' Union, and the Transportation Workers' Union. Akahata (Red Flag) reported that the Japanese police's suppression of strikers has reached an unprecedented scale in the history of the Japanese labor movement. In August, the reactionary authorities issued 1,000 arrest warrants to arrest workers and farmers. On September 3rd alone, 660 people were arrested in Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaido, and the government dismissed 399 workers and staff on the same day. The National Liaison Committee of Government Agencies and Municipal Agencies Workers' Unions, the National Railway Workers' Union, the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, and the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Labor Unions have all protested against the government's reactionary suppression.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. TASS, Tokyo, 3rd. "Social News" reports that Japanese capitalists, after banning the Civil Service Workers' Union Committee, are also attempting to restrict or completely abolish workers' rights to collective bargaining and strikes. The general headquarters for the capitalists' offensive against the working class is the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations. The federation has five manufacturers' associations under its jurisdiction and established eight local branches in April. The Standing Committee of the federation has prepared a plan to revise labor laws for the worse. The federation is supported by former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida and other leaders of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party. The employers' conference scheduled for mid-September will mark the beginning of the capitalists' offensive against the workers.

　　不顾反动政府禁令与大逮捕
  　日本罢工运动不断扩大
    国营铁道工人罢工已具有全国规模
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社报导：不顾反动政府的禁止罢工令与大量逮捕，日本工人为反对修改公务员法的罢工运动与抗议运动仍在不断扩大中。北海道国营铁道工人的罢工，现已蔓延至本州和九州，已具有全国规模罢工的性质。在九州，除铁路工人罢工外，电讯员工亦已停止工作，五金工人与矿工亦正准备罢工。日立邮政工人的罢工，已发展为总罢工。国营专业的罢工浪潮，正迅速蔓延至私人企业工人工会如全日电气业工人、制钢业工人及运输业工人诸工会的会员中。赤旗报载称：日本警察对罢工者的镇压已具有日本劳工运动史上无可比拟的规模。在八月份，反动当局曾发出一千张拘票逮捕工人与农民。而在九月三日一天，在北海道首府札幌，即有六百六十人被捕，政府并于同日辞退了三百九十九名工人与职员。政府机关与市政机关职员工会全国联络委员会、国营铁道工人工会、全日递信工人工会、全日产业劳动组合联合会，均对政府的反动镇压提出了抗议。
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社东京三日讯：“社会新闻”报导，日本资本家在封禁公务员工会委员会以后，又在意图限制或完全取消工人集体议价及罢工的权利。资本家对工人阶级进行攻势的总司令部是日本经济组织联合会。该会下辖五个制造家协会，于四月份设立八个地方分会。该会常务委员会已准备将劳工法修改得更坏的计划。该会受到前首相吉田茂及自由党和民主党其他领袖的支持。预定九月中旬召开的雇主会议，将标志着资本家对工人发动攻势的开端。
