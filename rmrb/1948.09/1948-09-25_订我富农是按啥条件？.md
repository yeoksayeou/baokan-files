　　What Conditions Were Used to Classify Me as a Rich Peasant?
　　Editor's Note: In the process of class determination, democracy should be fully promoted, allowing anyone (including landlords and rich peasants) to freely express different opinions, so that no one is wronged. After the three-round public discussion and finalization, if the person concerned still disagrees, they can appeal to the higher-level government. Based on this principle, if the situation described by Li Lulü is true, then the method of changing the class status in Xiyanxing Village deserves investigation. It is a mistake and a violation of policy for the work team to arbitrarily detain people during class determination. After Li Lulü came to our newspaper to complain, our newspaper has twice sent letters to the Ping Shan County Committee requesting investigation and handling and a reply. However, according to the situation Li Lulü described, the Ping Shan County Committee's handling of this issue is not serious enough. It is hoped that the Ping Shan County Committee will handle this issue in a timely manner before the distribution of floating wealth in the village, based on the spirit of the policy and the specific circumstances, and provide a public response.

Comrade Editor:
　　I am from Xiyanxing Village, Second District, Ping Shan. Since I was a child, my family was poor and relied entirely on renting land from others to make a living. Through years of hard work, our life gradually improved. Around 1933, we started using a long-term hired laborer. At this time, my family had about forty mu of land (all dry land, only five or six mu of irrigated land), more than one mu of garden land, and rented seven mu of paddy fields. There were fourteen people in my family, and my eldest and second sons and I were the main labor force. My father ran a pharmacy (the annual income was not much, and because it was a family business, accounts were never settled annually, but it only supplemented some pocket money). He also delivered meals to the fields, threshed, and did some light work. The women all spun and wove, and also worked in the fields when they were free. This continued until 1935. In 1936, because the rented paddy fields were returned, we no longer used a long-term hired laborer. In 1937, we bought ten mu of paddy fields and hired another long-term laborer (this land was flooded in 1939). My eldest and second sons and I participated in the labor. Later, after the Japanese devils came, around 1938, our Eighth Route Army also arrived. My eldest son participated in work at the district level, and we still used a long-term laborer. My second son and I worked at home, and my third son, who was sixteen or seventeen years old, could also provide a person's worth of labor. At this time, my family still had about forty mu of land. But in August, the Japanese devils came and burned our house, and the long-term laborer left in less than a year. In the following eight or nine years, due to financial difficulties, we did not hire anyone again (not even short-term laborers). However, last year during the distribution, my family was classified as landlords and driven out of the house. In February of this year, only one courtyard gate was opened to allow us to return. This autumn, the work team came to re-determine class status and return things, and classified me as a rich peasant. I felt that the conditions were not met, so I went to the district with my eldest son to ask. The district committee said that whatever the classification is, it is, and they cannot wrong you. They wrote a letter to the work team. Later, Comrade Gao of the work team consulted with the district. My third son went to ask again, and the district said that it should be a rich household. Later, my eldest son went to ask again, and they still said that it should be a rich peasant and cannot be changed. Afterward, the village distributed some cooking utensils to the landlord and rich peasant households first, and what they gave me was all broken. My third son was a bit reckless and asked the work team, "What is my class status? Why are you giving me these unusable things!" The work team said it was a rich peasant. My third son took the September 3rd issue of the People's Daily and showed it to him, which contained the New China News Agency mailbox's answer regarding the standards for calculating the years and amount of exploitation of landlords and rich peasants, and asked him what conditions he was using to classify us. He didn't say anything and detained my third son. He was detained for three days before being released. Later, my fourth son (who is a teacher in Huolu) and I went to the newspaper office to ask what my class status should be. The newspaper office introduced us to the county committee for handling. The county committee calculated the amount of exploitation at 15%. My fourth son felt this was incorrect, so he went to the newspaper office again. The newspaper office wrote another letter to the county committee. This time, the county committee calculated it at 25%, but when calculating the total income, they only included agricultural income, saying that it exceeded 25%, and decided it was a rich peasant. However, my family also had income from the pharmacy, spinning and weaving, and raising pigs, none of which were included in the calculation. My fourth son said this was incorrect and asked the county committee to recalculate, but the county committee still said it was a rich peasant. I don't know what to do about this matter. My village is currently returning floating wealth to wrongly accused well-to-do middle peasants. I don't know if my class status meets the requirements for a rich peasant. What should be done with my confiscated floating wealth? I hope you can resolve this quickly.

### 订我富农是按啥条件？

　　订我富农是按啥条件？
    编者按：划成份中应该充分发扬民主，允许任何人（包括地主富农）自由发表不同意见，不叫一人受屈。三榜定案后，本人不服仍可向上级政府申诉。根据这一原则，如李禄禄所提情况真实，则西沿兴改定成份的办法值得检查。工作组划成份中随便扣人，更属违犯政策的错误作法。李禄禄来本报诉说后本报已两次函请平山县委检查处理并作答复。但根据李禄禄所谈情况，平山县委处理这问题是不够严肃认真的，希望平山县委对此问题根据政策精神，和具体情况在该村分浮财前及时处理，并作公开答复。编辑同志：
    我是平山二区西沿兴村人，自小时家里穷苦，全靠租种人家的地过日子。全家长年辛苦劳动，光景才慢慢过好。到民国二十二年时开始用过一个长工，这时家里有四十来亩地（都是旱地，只有五六亩井浇地），一亩多园地，还租种了七亩稻地，家里大小十四口人，我和大儿二儿参加主要劳动，父亲开了个药铺（一年收入不多，因是自家生意，年年也不结帐，只是贴补个零花），也还上地送饭碾场做些轻活。妇女们都纺织，忙了也下地。这样到二十四年。二十五年因租的稻地退了，便不用长工了。二十六年买进了十亩稻地，又用了一个长工（这地二十八年被水冲了），家里是我和大儿二儿参加劳动。后来日本鬼子来后大概是二十七年吧，咱八路军也来了，我大儿参加区上工作，仍用了一个长工，我和二儿在家劳动，三儿已十六七岁，也能顶住一个人劳动，这时家里还是四十来亩地。但到八月间鬼子来烧了房子，不到一年长工就走了。以后这八九年因生活困难，没再用过人（短工也没用）。可是去年平分时把我家订成了地主，扫地出门，今年二月才开了一个院的门让回去。今年秋天工作组来改订成份退东西，又把我订成富农，我觉得条件不合，就和大儿一块到区上去问问，区委说该啥是啥，不能屈你。他给工作组写了信。后来工作组高同志到区上商量了，我三儿又去问，区上又说该是富家，后来我大儿子又去问，还是说该是富农，不能改啦。以后村里给地主富农户先分了些做饭家具，给我的都是破的，我三儿有些鲁张，就问工作组：“我是啥成份，为啥给我这些不能使的！”工作组说是富农，我三儿就拿了九月三号的人民日报给他看，上面有新华社信箱答的计算地主富农的剥削年限剥削分量的标准，问他是按的是啥条件？人家不说，就把我三儿扣起来了。一直扣了三天才放出来。后来我和四儿（在获鹿当教员）到报社问问，看我到底该是个啥成份，报社介绍我找县委处理，县委给算剥削分量是按百分之十五算的，我四儿觉得不对，后来又找报社，报社又给写信找县委，这次县委是给按百分之廿五算的，可是算总收入只算农业收入，说是超过百分之二十五，决定是富农，但我家还有药铺、纺织、养猪等项收入，均不给计算在内。我四儿说不对，请县委再算算，县委还说是富农。这事情不知到底该怎办？我村正在给错斗的富裕中农退浮财，不知我的成份到底够不够个富农？没收我的浮财该如何处理？希望能赶快给我解决一下。　　　　　平山二区西沿兴村李禄禄
