[Jinzhong News] The democratic governments of Qixian and Yuci counties correctly implement the lenient policy towards Yan's puppet military officers and civil servants. When Qixian city was first liberated, many Yan's puppet personnel were afraid to approach us due to the deceptive propaganda of the Yan bandits. The democratic government implements a lenient policy towards puppet soldiers, personnel of puppet political organs, and special agents who lay down their weapons. More than 700 officers and soldiers of the People's Self-Defense Army who were captured were released on the spot and sent home. Puppet government and economic organ cadres captured on the battlefield were released after investigation, allowing them to continue to keep documents and materials and hand them over to the democratic government. Eight section-level cadres of the puppet government, deeply feeling the leniency of the democratic government, led the original organ personnel to report schedules to our city defense organs, clear materials, and explain relationships. More than 400 people from the puppet army and puppet family members have registered with us continuously. We adopt a policy of not arresting or capturing personnel from the puppet Jin-Cha (Jinzhong-Chahar) system, from bureau chiefs and police station chiefs downwards. Fan Wei Niu, the leader of the special police team of Yan Bandit's Comrades Association, was initially afraid of being killed. During martial law, he jumped over the city wall and ran to Nanxi Village. However, when our army lifted martial law and opened the city gates, he automatically returned to the city and registered with the democratic government. The person in charge of the county branch of Yan Bandit's Comrades Association also registered with the democratic government after the Zhao Chengshou group was completely annihilated and recognized the lenient policy of our army. After the liberation of Yuci, the democratic government treated puppet army and puppet organization personnel who stopped resisting and were unwilling to flee with Yan Bandit with leniency, protecting their lives and safety. Up to now, 1,166 people have registered with the democratic government, including more than 380 field grade officers such as the puppet Eighth Column Commander, Chief of Staff, Deputy Commander, Military Hospital Director, and school-level officers from the Provisional 45th Division and the 7th Security Regiment. After talks, they voluntarily surrendered many weapons, ammunition, and supplies. The process by which Li Shusheng, a major staff officer of the puppet Yuci Security Command, broke away from the Yan bandit group and registered with the democratic government to start a new life, can represent the common psychology of ordinary Yan puppet personnel: He was originally a surplus officer of Yan Bandit's 19th Army. After Japan surrendered, he returned to Taiyuan with his family and served as a major staff officer of the Eighth Column. When he received Yan Bandit's retreat order on the night of the 19th of last month, he was discussing with his wife at home: Following the Yan Bandit army back to Taiyuan, they would not be able to make a living, and they would soon become prisoners. If they didn't follow, they were afraid that the People's Liberation Army would enter the city and kill them. At this time, he remembered that the People's Liberation Army had sent back two wounded battalion commanders and company commanders of the puppet Ninth Column during the day, and all his fear disappeared. While his family was arguing fiercely, the People's Liberation Army had already entered the city. His family changed into civilian clothes and hid. Wang Qin Zheng, a deputy commander of the Yan army who lived not far from him, also changed his name and hid. Under the influence of the democratic government's lenient policy, they initially took a tentative attitude to register with the democratic government. However, when he remembered that the People's Liberation Army staff had been to his courtyard twice and had not touched anything in his house, he finally dispelled the ghost stories told by Yan Xishan, the warlord, that the People's Liberation Army abused and killed prisoners. He voluntarily told the democratic government his true position and asked to atone for his crimes. He said: "I am willing to be a free citizen in the liberated area, and I am no longer willing to be a reactionary pawn for the local emperor Yan Xishan." (Chun Dian, Bing Ru)

　　祁县榆次伪员深感我军宽大
  　自动交出弹药物资
    【晋中讯】祁县、榆次两县民主政府，正确执行对阎伪军官职员的宽大政策。祁县城甫告解放时，不少阎伪人员因受阎匪欺骗宣传影响，尚不敢向我接近。民主政府对于放下武器之伪军、伪政民机关人员及特工人员一律执行宽大政策，被俘的七百余名民卫军官兵，当场释放回家，在战场上俘获之伪政府及经济机关干部，经查明后，即予释放，让他们继续保管文件物资，向民主政府移交。伪政府八名科级干部深感民主政府之宽大，率领原机关人员向我城防机关呈报表册，清理物资，交待关系。伪军伪属人员连续向我登记者，已达四百余人。对于伪晋察人员，从局长、派出所长以下，我均采取不捕不俘政策。阎匪同志会特警组长范卫牛，最初怕杀，在戒严期间，跳城跑至南席村，但当我军解除戒严开放城门后，他又自动返回城来，向民主政府登记。阎匪同志会县分会负责人，于赵承绶集团被全部歼灭，认清我军宽大政策后，也向民主政府登记。榆次解放后，民主政府对于停止抵抗，不愿跟阎匪逃窜的伪军伪组织人员，一律宽大对待，保护其生命安全。刻向民主政府登记者已达一一六六人，其中有伪八总队团长、参谋长、副团长、军医院长及暂四十五师、保七团等校级军官三百八十余人，经过谈话后，彼等自动交出武器弹药物资很多。伪榆次保安司令部少校参谋李树生脱离阎匪集团向民主政府登记自新的过程，可以代表一般阎伪人员的共同心理：他原系阎匪十九军编余军官，日本投降后，带着眷属随阎匪回了太原，任八总队少校参谋，当他上月十九日夜接到阎匪撤退命令时，正和老婆在家里商量：跟着阎匪军回到太原，生活顾不住，不久也就要当俘虏。不跟走又怕解放军进城杀头。这时他想起解放军在白天送回伪九总队两个负伤的营长和连长的事情，顿时消失了一切恐惧。一家人正在激剧的争辩，解放军已经入城了，他一家人便换上便衣，隐藏起来。和他住得不远的一个阎军副团长王勤政，改名换姓，也隐蔽起来。他们在民主政府宽大政策的感召下，起初还抱着试探态度去民主政府登记，但当他想起解放军工作人员去他院内两次，都没有动他家里任何东西时，终于最后打消了阎匪锡山所说解放军虐杀俘虏的鬼话，自动向民主政府说出真实的职位，并且要求立功赎罪。他说：“我愿意在解放区当一个自由的公民，不愿再给土皇帝阎锡山做反动的走卒了”。（春甸、冰如）
