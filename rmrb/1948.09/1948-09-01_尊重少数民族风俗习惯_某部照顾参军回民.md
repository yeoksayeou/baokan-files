The company collectively performed a great meritorious service on the way south, and after arriving at the unit, they were respected and welcomed by their superiors and comrades, and their morale was extremely high. All the commanders and fighters of the company recently wrote a letter to the Daming Democratic County Government saying: "The superiors take great care of our Hui people's living habits and respect our ethnic minorities very much. All of our weapons are captured American weapons, and everyone is very happy." The political department of the unit also sent a letter to the Daming Democratic County Government regarding the company's work and living conditions, requesting that it be forwarded to the families of all Hui soldiers.
