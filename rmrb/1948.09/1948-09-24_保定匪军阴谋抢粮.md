[Jizhong Electric] The Kuomintang bandit army in the isolated city of Baoding is plotting to seize the autumn harvest, as confirmed from various sources. They have now divided the surrounding areas into three grain seizure zones: The area east of the Pinghan Railway and west of the Gao-Bao Road is the Southern Baoding grain seizure zone, responsible for by the 3rd Regiment of the Provisional 32nd Division of the enemy's New 3rd Army, the puppet Security 9th Regiment, and the 13th and 15th Squadrons of the puppet National Salvation Vanguard Force. The area west of the Pinghan Railway and north of Baoding is the Northwest grain seizure zone, responsible for by the 2nd Regiment of the Provisional 33rd Division of the New 2nd Army, equipped with the major townships of the puppet 8th Special Commissioner's Office. The Dacheng Village area east of Baoding is the Eastern Baoding grain seizure zone, responsible for by a portion of the enemy's New 2nd Army and the 12th and 14th Squadrons of the puppet National Salvation Vanguard Force. The remaining 1st Regiment of the 32nd Division serves as a mobile force, equipped with the puppet Qingyuan County Government, to forcibly collect grain in enemy-controlled villages near Baoding.
