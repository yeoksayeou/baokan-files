	Bird's-Eye View of Major Cities in the Northeast Liberated Area
    Within the interconnected Northeast Liberated Area, a dense network of railways and highways links 230 cities and towns of all sizes. Over the past three years, these cities have gradually embarked on a path of sound development under the vigorous protection and active restoration efforts of the democratic government. Especially in the past six months, due to the thorough implementation of the policy of developing production, prospering the economy, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital, a new and thriving atmosphere has emerged.
    Harbin, with a population of over 800,000, is the capital of the Northeast Liberated Area and its political, economic, and cultural center. Five railways radiate in all directions, connecting major cities and towns in eastern, western, southern, and northern Manchuria. Trucks on the highways and ships on the Songhua River travel back and forth incessantly, making industry and commerce extremely prosperous. According to statistics at the end of June, there were 26,320 industrial and commercial establishments in the city, an increase of three and a half times compared to February of last year, and unemployment has gradually disappeared. The municipal construction, such as the supply of tap water, electricity, fuel, and grain, has been sufficient and abundant due to the vigorous management of the democratic government. There has been great development in culture and education in the past three years. The city now has more than ten colleges and universities, including the Northeast Academy of Sciences, the Industrial University, and the Railway College, as well as six middle schools and one normal school, and nearly two hundred primary schools. The publishing industry includes more than 20 public and private newspapers and periodicals, such as the Northeast Daily, the Harbin Daily, the Northeast Pictorial, and Knowledge Magazine. Among them, the Northeast Daily sells more than 70,000 copies daily, covering all parts of the Northeast Liberated Area. There are more than 33,000 foreign residents from more than 20 countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Korea, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Italy, and Romania, who operate more than 700 industrial and commercial enterprises. They are protected by the democratic government and receive equal treatment in all material supplies under the principle of complying with the laws and regulations of the democratic government.
    Traveling northwest from Harbin by train along the Changchun Railway for eight hours will take you to Qiqihar. The city is one of the oldest cities in Northeast China and is now the economic center of Heilongjiang and Nenjiang provinces. Goods from the Nenjiang River basin and the Mongolian grasslands northwest of Qiqihar are gathered and distributed here. Business is booming in the city, with the South Gate being the most prosperous. Mongolians, Manchus, Han Chinese, and Hui people trade here, mainly in grain, timber, furs, mountain products, and industrial products, and new industries are also increasing daily. According to statistics in early August, there were 4,021 industrial and commercial establishments in the city. The city has railways south to Liaoyuan and Siping, northwest to Manzhouli, northeast to Bei'an and Nenjiang, and southeast to Harbin, all of which are unobstructed.
    Mudanjiang City, 270 kilometers southeast of Harbin, is a newly emerging city in Northeast China. Fifteen years ago, the city was just a small station on the Changchun Railway. Because of the abundance of timber and various industrial raw materials in the surrounding area, it became an important town after the construction of the railway connecting Tumen in the south and Jiamusi in the north. According to statistics in May of this year, there are more than 5,000 industrial and commercial establishments in the city, more than half of which are modern industries. Their products sell well in northern and southern Manchuria. The total number of workers in the city is more than 100,000.
    Jiamusi, the capital of Hejiang Province, located on the south bank of the lower reaches of the Songhua River, is also one of the emerging large cities in Northeast China. Two railways extend in semicircles towards Harbin, taking 18 hours to reach the whole journey. The Songhua River has frequent shipping, making the city the most prosperous water and land port in the lower reaches of the Songhua River. Industry and commerce are developing rapidly. There are nearly 3,000 industrial and commercial households in the city, including 803 new industrial establishments from January to April of this year. Helibei County, north of the city, is rich in coal, which is of good quality and high output. In addition to supplying the entire province, it also supplies a large amount to Harbin and its surrounding areas.
    Jilin City is located on the right bank of the Songhua River and is the fourth largest city in Northeast China. The scenery in the suburbs is beautiful and is known as the "First Scenery Under Heaven." It has a population of about 260,000. In 1943, the Japanese invaders completed the famous Xiaofengman Hydropower Plant here, which supplied electricity to Jingbo Lake, Fuxin, Xi'an, Fushun, Anshan, and other places, with a power generation capacity of 280,000 kilowatts, making Jilin a heavy industrial city. This March, within 20 days after the city was liberated, trains to Harbin were running smoothly. Tap water, electricity, post and telecommunications were also quickly restored. Except for industries that are detrimental to the people's livelihood, such as luxury goods and superstitious items, the rest of the industry has been fully restored. Among the industries, papermaking, cement, flax, synthetic petroleum, and shipbuilding are well-known. The market is much more prosperous than during the Kuomintang rule. The city now has Northeast University, Industrial College, Midwifery School, and four middle schools, with more than a thousand students each. There are more than 20,000 primary school students.
    East of Jilin, Yanji City on the north bank of the Tumen River has railways north to Mudanjiang and west to Jilin, and can be transferred to Harbin from Lafa. It is one of the oldest cities in Northeast China. Before Jilin was recovered, it was the seat of the Jilin Provincial Government. Due to the enemy and puppet regimes' various monopolistic rule before August 15th, there were only about 500 industrial and commercial establishments in the city. In the three years since liberation, with the support of the democratic government, factories and shops have been increasing daily. There are now 2,500 formal industrial and commercial establishments. Yanji's school education is particularly developed, with 19 public and private middle schools, and the number of middle school students accounts for 21 per thousand of the total population of the county. Fifty percent of the students are poor children who could not attend school in the past.
    Sipingjie, southwest of Jilin, is the transportation center of Manchuria and one of the emerging cities. It is a strategic point in military terms, and in economic terms, it is also an industrial town due to the abundant coal reserves in the nearby Xi'an area. The original railway runs north to Changchun, south to Shenyang, east to Xi'an, and west to Liaoyuan, turning north to Qiqihar, or turning to Rehe from Liaoyuan. The urban area has a considerable scale of modern industrial base, but it was reduced to a dead city during the occupation of Chiang's troops. After our army recovered it, the railways east to Xi'an and to the rear of Liaoyuan were opened long ago. The number of industrial and commercial establishments that have been restored and newly opened has reached more than 1,600, including machinery, leather, papermaking, cloth and groceries. Post, telephone, and tap water were restored within a few days after the liberation, and the restoration of electricity made the dead city, which had been dark for more than a year, see the light again.
    Traveling southeast by train from Sipingjie will take you to Tonghua, Ji'an, and other places. From Ji'an, you can reach Andong City on the banks of the Yalu River in two days by car. The city is one of the economic centers of southern Manchuria and the seat of the Andong Provincial Government. The southern section of the Anfeng Railway has long been opened to traffic, and in addition to the highways northeast to Tonghua and Ji'an, there are also highways west to Wafangdian and Haicheng on the southern section of the Changchun Railway. Since the city was re-liberated last year, especially after the southern Manchurian liberated area has been gradually expanded and the transportation with northern Manchuria has been restored and smooth, it has gradually recovered and has some development. According to recent statistics, there are 1,849 industrial establishments and 3,200 stores. The city's textile, papermaking, shipbuilding, and other industries are very large in scale and occupy an important position in Northeast China's industry.
    Wafangdian, the political and economic center of the southern Liaoning area west of Andong and south of Shenyang, is densely populated, and its textile industry is the most developed. Because of its coastal location, the fishing and salt industries are very developed, and the fruit-growing area is also vast.
    In addition, there are Anshan and Yingkou, newly recovered cities in the southern Liaoning area. Anshan is located 120 miles south of Shenyang and is the location of one of the largest steel mills in the Far East, known as the "Steel Capital," "Iron Capital," and "Treasure of Manchurian Industry." The iron reserves are 600 million tons. Yingkou is located at the mouth of the Liao River and is an important trading port in southern Manchuria, mainly producing fish and salt. Due to the long-term rule and destruction of the Kuomintang bandit troops in the above two cities, the people's lives are extremely difficult, and the recovery of industry and commerce is also more difficult. At present, the democratic government is continuing to vigorously support industry and commerce and help the people solve production difficulties.

　　东北解放区主要城市鸟瞰
    在联成一片的东北解放区内，密如蛛网的铁路与公路联结着二百卅个大中小城市。三年来，这些城市在民主政府大力保护和积极恢复下，已逐渐走上了健全发展的道路，特别是在过去半年中，由于贯彻执行发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的方针，更呈现了蒸蒸日上的新气象。
    拥有八十多万人口的哈尔滨，是东北解放区的首府，政治、经济、文化的中心。五条铁路向四周辐射，畅通东西南北满各大城镇，公路线上的汽车大车和松花江上的航轮往来不绝，工商业极为繁盛。据六月底统计，该市工商业共达两万六千三百二十家，较去年二月增加三倍半，失业现象已逐渐敛迹。市政建设如自来水、电力、燃料及粮食的供应上，由于民主政府的大力经营，目前已足够而有余裕。文化教育方面三年来更有极大之发展。市内现有东北科学院、工业大学、铁路学院等专科以上学校十余所，中学六所及师范学校一所，与小学近两百所。出版业有东北日报、哈尔滨日报、东北画报，知识杂志等二十余家公私营报刊。其中东北日报每日畅销七万余份，遍及东北解放区各地。市内外侨有苏、美、英、法、朝鲜、捷、匈、意、罗等二十余国侨民三万三千余人，经营工商业之外侨共七百余家。他们在遵守民主政府法令的原则下经营各种工商业，同样得到了民主政府的保护和一切物资供应上的平等待遇。
    从哈尔滨沿中长铁路搭火车向西北行八小时可抵齐齐哈尔。该市为东北古老城市之一，现在是黑龙江、嫩江两省经济中心。嫩江流城及齐市西北蒙古草原之商货，均以此为集散地。市内生意兴隆，以南门最盛，蒙满汉回均贸易于此，以粮食、木材、皮毛山货及工业产品为大宗，新兴工业也日有增加。据八月初统计：全市工商业共为四○二一家。该市有铁路南到辽源、四平，西北到满洲里，东北到北安、嫩江，东南到哈尔滨，各线均畅通无阻。
    哈市东南二百七十公里之牡丹江市，为东北一新兴城市。该市十五年前还是中长路上一小站，因附近盛产木材及各种工业原料，自修筑南通图们北到佳木斯的铁路后，乃成要镇。据本年五月份统计：全市工商业已超过五千家，半数以上为现代化的工业，产品畅销南北满各地。统计全市工人达十万以上。
    位于松花江下游南岸的合江省省会佳木斯，也是东北新兴大城市之一。有两条铁路各以半圆形伸向哈尔滨，全程十八小时可到。松花江航轮来往频繁，故该市已成为松花江下游最繁盛的水陆码头。工商业日渐发达。现全市有工商业近三千户，其中本年一月至四月新闻的工业即达八○三家。市北鹤立县盛产煤炭，煤质好，产量大，除供应全省外，并大量供应哈市及其附近地区。
    吉林城濒松花江右岸，为东北第四大城。四郊景色美丽，有“天下第一江山”之称。人口约二十六万。一九四三年日寇在此完成著名的小丰满水力发电厂，曾供给镜泊湖、阜新、西安、抚顺、鞍山等地电力，发电量达二十八万基罗瓦特，使吉林一跃而为重工业城市。今年三月该市重获解放后二十天中，与哈尔滨之火车即告畅通。自来水、电力、邮电等亦迅速恢复。工商业除不利国民生计的奢侈品迷信品等行业外，其余已完全复业。工业中以造纸、洋灰、亚麻、人造石油与修船等为著。市面较国民党统治时期已大见繁荣。市内现有东北大学、工业专门学校、助产学校及中学四所，学生皆在千人以上。小学学生达两万余人。
    吉林以东，图们江北岸之延吉市，有铁路北通牡丹江，西通吉林，并可由拉法转哈尔滨，是东北古老城市之一，在吉林未收复前曾为吉林省政府所在地。市内工商业因“八一五”前遭敌伪各种垄断统治，仅剩五百家左右，解放后三年来，在民主政府扶植下，工厂商店日有增加，现正式工商业已达二千五百家。延吉学校教育特别发达，有公私立中学十九所，中学生数目占全县人口总数千分之二十一。学生中有百分之五十为过去根本不能入学之贫苦子弟。
    吉林西南之四平街，为满洲交通中心亦是新兴城市之一。在军事上为一战略要点，在经济上以其附近西安诸地煤藏极丰，故亦为一工业重镇。原有铁路北通长春，南到沈阳，东至西安，西到辽源北转齐齐哈尔，或从辽源转向热河境内。市区有相当规模的现代工业基础，但在蒋军侵占期间曾沦为一座死城。我军收复后，东到西安和通往辽源后方的铁路早已畅通。工商业恢复和新开的已达一千六百余家，其中有机械、皮革、造纸、布匹杂货等业。邮政、电话、自来水，在解放后几天内即告恢复，而电力的恢复更使黑暗了一年多的死城重见光明。
    从四平街乘火车东南行，可达通化、辑安等地，从辑安乘汽车两天可达鸭绿江滨之安东市，该市为南满经济中心之一，亦为安东省府所在地。现安奉铁路南段早已通车，公路除东北到通化、辑安外，向西并至中长路南段的瓦房店、海城两地。市内工商业自去年重获解放，特别是南满解放区日渐扩大，与北满交通恢复畅通后，乃逐渐恢复并有若干发展。据最近统计：有工业一八四九家，商店三二○○家。该市纺织、造纸、造船等工业规模甚大，在东北工业中占重要地位。
    安东以西沈阳以南的辽南地区政治经济中心为瓦房店，该地人口稠密，以纺织业最为发达。因地势滨海，故渔业、盐业，均甚发达，水果种植地区亦广。
    此外辽南地区尚有鞍山、营口等新收复城市。鞍山位沈阳南一百二十里，为远东最大炼钢厂之一的所在地，有“钢都”、“铁都”及“满洲工业之宝”之称。铁的蕴藏量达六万万吨。营口位于辽河入海处，为南满一重要贸易港口，以出产渔盐为大宗。以上两城由于国民党匪军长期的统治和破坏，人民生活极为困苦，工商各业之恢复也较艰难。目前民主政府正继续大力扶植工商业，帮助人民解决生产困难。
