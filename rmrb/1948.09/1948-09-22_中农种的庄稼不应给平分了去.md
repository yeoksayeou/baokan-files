    Crops Grown by Middle Peasants Should Not Be Divided Equally
    To the Editors:
        I am from Bailinzhuang Village, Fifth District, Shijiazhuang City. During the land reform this spring, most of the land rented by middle peasants from wealthy peasants and landlords was divided among the poor peasants. The division of land is reasonable, but the crops grown by the middle peasants on these lands were also divided without compensation. Does this comply with the provisions of the Land Law Outline?
    Shijiazhuang City, Wang Ying

    Answer: The land rented by middle peasants from landlords and wealthy peasants should be divided during land reform, but the crops should still be harvested by the farming households according to the principle of whoever sows, reaps.

　　中农种的庄稼不应给平分了去编辑同志：
    我是石家庄市第五区柏林庄村人，在今年春季土改时，多数的中农所租种的富农地主的地，都给贫农平分了；平分土地是合理的，但是中农在这些土地上所种的庄稼也无代价的平分了。这是否合乎土地法大纲上的规定呢？
    石家庄市　王英
    答：中农租种的地主富农的土地，在土改中是应当予以平分的，但庄稼应根据谁种谁收原则仍归种地户收割。  　　　——编者
