　　Strive for Increased Wheat Production Next Year
  　Zuoquan Launches Manure Accumulation Campaign
    [Taihang News] In mid-August, the Zuoquan County Party Committee issued a notice calling on everyone to launch a large-scale manure accumulation campaign during agricultural idle time, "to ensure every household has a manure yard and manure piles everywhere." Now, under the leadership of labor heroes and village cadres, a movement has formed in various villages. Zhangba Village in the Third District, after hoeing the village's crops three times, held a production summary meeting on August 28th to discuss manure accumulation work. Team leader Cheng Fuxiang said: "If we want to harvest more grain next year, we must accumulate more manure now." He planned: his team has eight households, eight full laborers, three semi-laborers, and two female semi-laborers. In ten days, they can collect 172 loads of mountain manure, cut 1,000 bundles of artemisia, and compost 30 loads of fertilizer. Each household should accumulate 500 loads. His team's precise plan inspired other teams. Party member Gao Rongxi said, "Skillful seed selection is not as good as diligently applying manure." After the meeting, he negotiated to have the sheep graze on the wheat fields for 30 nights, and all team members mobilized to accumulate manure. Various deputy villages also launched challenges and competitions. Zhangbagou wanted to compete with Wangyangnao, and if the plan was not fulfilled, they would hoe two furrows as punishment. On August 29th and 30th, 112 male full laborers and 12 semi-laborers in the village all mobilized to collect mountain manure and cut artemisia, accumulating a total of 45,880 catties of fertilizer. Village deputy Du Yanchang continued to cut artemisia in the rain. He said, "Artemisia cut in the rain has high moisture content, decomposes quickly, and generates more heat, so it can compost more fertilizer." Woman Du Aiqiao led all the women in the village to cut 30 artemisia stalks a day, carry them back, chop and compost them immediately, and still spin cotton at night. Xin'dian Village in the Fifth District also held a manure accumulation meeting of sixteen mutual aid team leaders after hoeing the seedlings three times. Party member Zhang Youjin went out of the village and arranged for two flocks of sheep (700 in total) to be divided into two pens, plus more than 250 cattle in the village, divided into three pens, changed every five days, and filled in more than 3,000 loads of soil each time. Within twenty days, a total of twenty pens were trampled, yielding more than 77,000 loads of manure. Added to the artemisia cutting, the two items totaled 85,800 loads of compost. There are more than 23,000 mu of land, with an average of 36 loads of manure applied per mu. In addition, if accumulation continues this winter and next spring, the amount will increase to 70 loads per mu next year, striving to increase grain production by one dou per mu next year. Veterans Wang Cunxin and Miao Deyu from Beishang Village cut 9,840 catties of artemisia in seven days. Under their exemplary actions, they inspired the masses of the whole village. The two of them were written up on the village's public bulletin board for their model manure accumulation deeds. Pei Laifu from Caoting Village in the Third District has always been diligent, cultivating 19 mu of land. He hoed the corn three times and the millet twice. Hearing that the government called for manure accumulation, he didn't go to see operas or attend temple fairs, cutting more than 2,000 catties of artemisia and chopping and composting it immediately. When the villagers saw it, they all regretted not going to see the opera. Now, the whole county is carrying out this movement. (Hao Shimin, Zuoquan Office)

　　争取明年小麦增产
  　左权积肥形成运动
    【太行讯】左权县委八月中旬发出通知，号召大家在农闲空隙中展开积肥大运动，“要作到家家有粪场，处处有粪堆”。现在各村已在劳动英雄与村干部领导下形成运动。三区丈八村，在全村庄稼锄出三遍空隙中，于八月二十八号召开了生产总结会议，讨论了积肥工作。程福祥组长说：“要想明年多打粮，就得现在多积肥。”他计划着：他组共八户，男全劳力八个、半劳力三个，妇女半劳力二个，十天能打山粪积肥一百七十二担，割蒿一千捆，能沤肥三十担。每家要积到五百担。他组的精确计划，启发了各组。党员高荣喜说：“巧养种，不如拙上粪。”会散后，他就交涉好让羊群卧麦地三十夜，组员全部出动进行积肥。各副村还展开了挑战竞赛，丈八沟要和望阳瑙竞赛，作不到计划锄铧二口。在八月二十九日到三十日二天中，该村男全劳力一百一十二人，半劳力十二人，都出动打山粪、割蒿，共积肥四万五千八百八十斤。村副杜彦昌下着雨仍在割蒿。他说：“雨中割蒿水份大，烂的快，起火大，能多沤一担。”妇女杜爱巧，领导全村妇女，一天割蒿三十个，自己担回去，随手铡压沤上，夜里还不误纺花。五区新店村也是在三遍苗锄完后，召开了十六个互助组长积肥会议。党员张有金出村约好二群羊（七百只），分二个圈，再加上本村有二百五十多个牛，分了三个圈，每五天换一次，换时填土三千余担。二十天内，计踩圈二十个，得粪七万七千余担。加上割蒿，二宗共沤粪八万五千八百担。计有地二万三千余亩，每亩平均上粪三十六担。再加上今冬明春继续积，到明年每亩增到七十担，争取明年每亩增粮一斗。背上村荣军王存新、苗德雨二同志，七天内割蒿九千八百四十斤。在他二人模范行动下，带起了全村群众。现村里大众黑板上已公布着他二人积肥模范事迹。三区草亭村裴来富，一贯勤劳，种着十九亩地，玉茭锄出三遍，谷也锄了二遍，听说政府号召积肥，城里唱戏赶会都不去，割蒿二千余斤，并随手铡压了。村中人见了，都后悔不该去看戏。现全县都在开展着这一运动。（左权办公室郝世民）
