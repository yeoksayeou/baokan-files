Note: Comrade Ito Ritsu is a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and the Minister of the Peasant Movement Department. He is in his thirties and has been arrested and imprisoned twice. He was released after Japan surrendered.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Tokyo dispatch: Ito Ritsu, a spokesman for the Japanese Communist Party, was unsuccessfully assassinated by a reactionary assassin on the 13th. The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" recently published a commentary on this incident, stating that the Ashida government is fully responsible for this matter. The government has not taken any measures to dissolve the "Anti-Communist League" that attempted to assassinate Tokuda and has preserved militarist groups and rogue groups. The root of this violent behavior lies in the anti-communist instigation, evil encouragement, and conspiracies of parties and groups that hate the people, and they are trying to establish a "Non-Japanese Activities Investigation Committee."

　　日反动派谋刺伊藤律
  　日共赤旗报评称：芦田政府对此应负全责
    按：伊藤律同志系日共中央政治局委员、农民运动部部长，今年三十余岁，曾被捕入狱两次，日本投降以后始出狱。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】东京消息：日共发言人伊藤律于十三日为一反动派凶手谋刺未遂。日共机关报赤旗报顷就这一事件发表评论称，此事之责任完全在于芦田政府。政府未曾采取任何措施解散试图刺杀德田的“反共同盟”，并保存了军国主义团体与恶棍团体。这种暴力行为的根源，在于仇视人民之党派团体的反共煽惑、邪恶的鼓励与阴谋诡计，他们力图设立“非日活动调查委员会”。
