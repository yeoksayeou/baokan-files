Criticism and Suggestions

　　Lingshou wastes manpower
　　Affecting the masses' autumn harvest and wheat planting
The Lingshou County Grain Bureau and Armed Forces Department, due to a lack of precise planning each time they allocate public grain, are needlessly wasting manpower and increasing the burden on the masses, who are extremely dissatisfied with this. For example, when the Jiankang Brigade was stationed in ××, it needed more than 30,000 jin of millet per month. The Grain Bureau had about 50,000 to 60,000 jin of public grain stored in the village. A few days ago, the Grain Bureau mobilized a large number of laborers to transport the grain away. The Jiankang Brigade repeatedly requested that the public grain in the village be allocated to them to avoid wasting manpower on round-trip transportation, but the Grain Bureau emphasized unified allocation. As a result, the public grain was transported away, and the day after it was transported away, for some unknown reason, the originally transported grain was sent back. At this time of the autumn harvest season, when the masses are busy preparing for the autumn harvest and planting wheat, this round-trip transportation makes the masses very dissatisfied, and they are saying all sorts of strange things. This phenomenon of needlessly wasting manpower is the result of bureaucratic work style. It is hoped that the Lingshou County government will conduct a thorough inspection and correct it.

　　灵寿浪费民力
  　影响群众收秋种麦
    灵寿县粮食局、武装部每次拨发公粮，因缺乏精确的计划，而无故的浪费民力，增加群众的负担，群众对此极不满意。例如健康大队驻××时，每月需用小米三万余斤，粮食局存在该村公粮约五、六万斤，在前几天，粮食局动员了大批的民工，要把该村的粮食运走，健康大队曾多次要求把该村公粮拨给健康大队应用，以免往返搬运浪费民力，但粮食局强调统一调剂，结果把公粮运走了，运走的第二天，不知为什么又把原运走的公粮送回来了。当此秋忙时期，群众正在忙着进行准备秋收、种麦，这样往返转运，使群众非常不满意，说什么怪话的也有，这种无故浪费民力的现象，是官僚主义作风的结果所致，希望灵寿县政府，应该深刻的检查并予以纠正。  　　　　　　　　（湘龙）
    如果这一反映属实，应即纠正，希灵寿县府切实进行检查——编者
