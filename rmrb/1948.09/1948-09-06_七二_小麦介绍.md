Introduction to "72" Wheat
    Guo Yimin

    I. Origin of the Variety: "72" wheat is an excellent variety bred before the "July 7th Incident." It was widely planted around Qingfengdian in Ding County. Later, it was gradually promoted to the Tang River basin and the Guangli Canal area. However, because the masses did not pay attention to seed selection, this excellent variety has undergone some changes due to gradual hybridization. The six-edged head, six large edges, flat head, big head man, and "qi si feng" (wind-resistant) wheat currently planted by the masses in the Guangli Canal area of Tang County, although with diverse names, have roughly the same characteristics and traits as "72" wheat. However, the color and appearance are slightly inferior and not as attractive as "72" wheat.

    II. Planting Method: The cultivation method is the same as for ordinary wheat. The sowing period is from the Autumn Equinox to the Cold Dew. The masses in the Guangli Canal area generally apply grass manure and sow with a seed drill, using seven or eight *shi* (市) *sheng* (升) of seeds per *mu* (亩). If black beans and oil cake are also applied with the seed drill, eight or nine *shi sheng* of seeds per *mu* are required. If broadcasting, only one or two *shi sheng* of seeds are needed. The maturity period is one or two days later than ordinary wheat. "72" wheat has tall, thick, and hard stalks and is very wind-resistant, commonly known as "qi si feng." Its resistance to jaundice is also very strong. The wheat grains are white, large, short, and thick, also known as "big head man" or "击鼓麦" (drum wheat). "72" wheat has deep roots and can absorb more nutrients.

    III. Yield: If sufficient fertilizer is applied, "72" wheat can yield up to 30 *shi dou* (市斗) per *mu*, which is 10 *shi dou* more than the highest yield of other wheat. Luo Kuizi, a villager in Beiluo Village of a certain county, planted 1.7 *mu* of "72" wheat last year, applying 80 loads (approximately 27 carts) of grass manure per *mu*, and harvested more than 23 *shi dou* of wheat per *mu*. With the same fertilizer and management methods, other wheat yielded 12 *shi dou* per *mu*. This year, he planted 1.7 *mu* of "72" wheat again, applying 70 loads of grass manure and 10 pieces of oil cake, and harvested 16 *shi dou* per *mu*. The "line wheat" (线麦), managed in the same way, yielded 10 *shi dou* per *mu*. According to him, the previous crop was corn stalks last year, and this year it was millet stalks, so the yield was slightly lower. Yang Luopei, a villager in Zhu Beiluo, planted 1.5 *mu* of "big head man" wheat the year before last, applying 10 large carts of hot manure (freshly taken from the pen) and 20 pieces of oil cake per *mu*, and harvested 27 *shi dou* per *mu*. Kang Luomei has continuously planted "72" wheat for five or six years, with an average yield of three to four *shi dou* more per *mu* than ordinary wheat each year. In the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), when jaundice was most severe, ordinary wheat yielded only three or four *shi dou*. "72" wheat still yielded 15 *shi dou*. The above villages have sticky soil, sown around the Autumn Equinox, and frozen water is applied before the Beginning of Winter. The following year, the first watering is done after Grain Rain, followed by hoeing with a large hoe. The second watering is done twenty days later, and the third watering is done another twenty days later. If hoeing follows watering, the wheat will be more drought-resistant and the harvest will be better. Three waterings are enough to ensure maturity. If watered again about half a month later, not only is it easier to pull when harvesting, but the wet soil also facilitates early planting of other crops. Sandy loam soil is cultivated in the same way as sticky soil, except that frozen water is not applied. Chen Luoshou, a villager in Dongxiasu, has continuously planted "72" wheat for two years. Last year, he applied 16 carts of grass manure per *mu* and harvested 13 *shi dou*, while ordinary wheat yielded a little more than 10 *shi dou*. It is said that the initial color of "72" wheat was very white, but it has turned red in the past two years (due to soil properties). Shi Luogen, a villager in Xixiasu, planted "72" wheat this year, applying 15 carts of fertilizer per *mu*, and harvested 23 *shi dou*, while ordinary wheat yielded less than 10 *shi dou*.

    IV. Wheat Comparison: In the past, because "72" wheat had large grains and thick skin, the masses feared that it would produce less flour, and the price of its flour was slightly lower than that of other wheat flour. In recent years, according to the experience of many people, "72" wheat flour can be used in various foods, and the price is only slightly different from that of ordinary flour. Some people have tested that "72" wheat does not produce less flour, but it is a bit refined, short, brittle. Each *dou* of "72" wheat weighs 16 *shi jin* (市斤), and can produce 13.5 *jin* of flour. The experiences and results of the masses and farms are consistent.

    "72" wheat is especially suitable for planting in low-lying and jaundice-prone areas. Its significant advantages are: 1. Stalks are stiff and wind-resistant; 2. Yield is higher than other wheat; 3. Ears are uniform; 4. Strong resistance to jaundice; 5. Large grains and white flour. The disadvantages are: 1. Flour is slightly coarse; 2. Flour refinement is slightly worse.

　　“七二”小麦介绍
    郭毅民
    一、品种的由来：“七二”小麦系“七七”事变前育成的优良品种，在定县清风店周围种植很多。以后逐渐推广到唐河流域及广利渠一带。但因群众不注意选种，这一优良品种已因逐年杂交而产生若干变化。现在唐县广利渠一带群众种植的六棱头、六大棱、齐头儿、大头翁、气死风等麦，名称虽杂，特点和性状却与“七二”麦大体相同，惟色气稍逊，不如“七二”麦漂亮好看。
    二、种植法：耕种方法与一般小麦同，秋分到寒露为播种期。广利渠群众一般施草粪耧播，每亩用种子七八市升；如兼施黑豆及油饼耧播，每亩需种子八九市升。如系撒播，仅需种子一二市升。成熟期比一般小麦晚一、二天。“七二”麦秆高大粗硬，非常耐风，俗有“气死风”之称。抗黄疸病力也甚强。麦粒色白，肥大短粗，又称大头翁、击鼓麦。“七二”麦扎根很深，能多吸收养分。
    三、产量：“七二”小麦如下足肥料，每亩最高能产三十市斗，比其他小麦最高产量多十市斗。某县北罗村民骆奎子，去年种“七二”小麦一亩七分，每亩上草粪八十驮（约二十七车），收麦二十三市斗多。其他小麦以同样肥料和经营方法，一亩收十二市斗。今年他又种了“七二”小麦一亩七分，施草粪七十驮、油饼十块，每亩收了十六市斗；同样经营的线麦，一亩收了十市斗。据他说去年系棒子茬，今年系谷茬，故产量差些。朱北罗村民杨洛配，前年种大头翁一亩五分，每亩施热粪（刚从圈中起的）十大车及油饼二十块，每亩收了二十七市斗。康洛美连种“七二”小麦五、六年，每年每亩平均较普通小麦多收三至四市斗。民国三十五年黄疸病最重，一般麦只收三四市斗。“七二”小麦还收了十五市斗。以上村为粘性土质，在秋分前后下种，立冬前放冻水；第二年谷雨后浇第一次水，随即以大锄锄一次。隔二十多天浇二水，再隔二十多天浇三水。如能随浇随锄，更能耐旱，收获更好。浇够三水，便能保证熟了。如再隔半月左右浇一次，不但收麦时易拔，且地湿便于提早播种别的作物。砂壤土质，耕种习惯除不上冻水外，其他与粘性土同。东下素村民陈洛寿，连种“七二”小麦二年。去年每亩施草粪十六车，收十三市斗，一般小麦收十市斗多。据说“七二”小麦最初粒色很白，近二年来变的红了（因地性关系）。西下素村民石洛根今年种“七二”小麦每亩施肥十五车，收二十三市斗，一般小麦则不及十市斗。
    四、出麦比较：过去因“七二”麦粒大、皮厚，群众害怕出面少，价钱比其他小麦面也稍低一点。近年来根据不少人的经验，“七二”麦粉在各种食品上都能使用，价钱和一般面粉也相差甚微了。有人试验，“七二”麦出面并不少，惟有点精短发脆。“七二”麦每斗粒重十六市斤，可出面十三斤半。群众和农场的经验，成果都相符合。
    “七二”麦在下湿地和好闹黄疸病的地区，种植特别适宜。其显著优点：一、秸硬耐风；二、产量高于其他小麦；三、出穗整齐；四、抗黄疸病力强；五、颗粒大面洁白。缺点是：一、出面稍笨；二、面精稍差。
