Taihang Xinhua Daily editorial calls for
	Immediately organize border area autumn harvest protection
[Taihang Electric] As the autumn harvest approaches, the Taihang Xinhua Daily, based on the current characteristics of the struggle against the enemy in the Yubei border area and the experience of wheat protection struggles, published an editorial calling for "immediate organization to protect the autumn harvest." It pointed out: (1) This year's wheat protection struggle began under relatively difficult and passive conditions, but thanks to our implementation of correct struggle principles and deployments, and the heroic struggle of the Party, government, army, and people, especially the armed forces and militia, the task of protecting the wheat harvest was successfully completed. Through the wheat harvest struggle, the phenomenon of no-man's-lands and the opposition between red and white areas was eliminated in our border areas. The positions for fighting the enemy and the people's ability to defend themselves have been greatly strengthened compared to before. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, after our powerful military and political blows, has become even more shaken and weakened, which has changed our previous passive situation and formed the current favorable situation for the autumn harvest protection struggle. Therefore, when deploying the autumn harvest protection struggle in the border areas, we should base ourselves on this favorable condition, on the one hand, to further strengthen the mass guerrilla warfare in the border areas, give full play to the excellent tradition of combining labor and military affairs, and rush to harvest, rush to cultivate, and rush to plant; on the other hand, we must more actively and aggressively attack the enemy, penetrate deep into the enemy's rear, and destroy the enemy's conspiracy to seize grain, putting the enemy in a passive position, so that we can more effectively protect the autumn harvest in the border areas. (2) In the wheat harvest struggle, the disintegration of the enemy and the elimination of the opposition between red and white areas and no-man's-lands yielded quick results. The most important reason for this was the launch of the political offensive. Therefore, in the autumn harvest protection struggle, we should continue to exert the power of the political offensive. We should, based on the two-year summary of the Liberation War, and in connection with the situation in our region, publicize victory, disintegrate the enemy, and organize the people in the Chiang-occupied areas to resist grain and resist taxes, exposing the enemy's conspiracy to divide the masses. We should educate the people in the Chiang-occupied areas not to fall for the enemy's tricks, and to cooperate with each other to deal with the enemy. (3) The basic reason why the political offensive exerted great power in the wheat harvest struggle is that our border areas have straightened out their policies. Therefore, in the autumn harvest protection struggle, we must continue to implement the correction of deviations and the straightening of policies step by step, in order to consolidate the anti-Chiang united front and further mobilize the masses. (4) After the autumn harvest, wheat will be planted soon. Our slogans are: defend the autumn harvest, defend wheat planting, and defend the able-bodied men. Harvest quickly, fight quickly, hide quickly, plant quickly; harvest while fighting, hide while fighting, plant while fighting; use the fields as threshing grounds and hide the harvest as you go. (5) It is necessary to hold good cadre meetings, to make necessary rectification and training of the divisional troops, county cadre teams, district cadre teams, and militia, to unify thinking and unify deployment, and to make full preparations for weapons such as landmines and ammunition, and to strengthen the command and intelligence work at all levels. The editorial said: The wheat harvest struggle was victorious, and we are also confident of achieving victory in the autumn harvest protection struggle. But we must not be blinded by victory. All ideas of arrogance and paralysis are dangerous.
    The editorial pointed out: The autumn harvest in the hinterland and the wheat planting on fallow land will also be a series of relatively intense tasks, and we should also seize the leadership and organize the masses to harvest and thresh quickly, and strive for time to plant wheat on fallow land. Some areas will inevitably have to complete certain war service tasks at the same time. Therefore, we should continue to rectify and organize mutual aid teams, give full play to the role of organizational mutual aid, and mobilize the vast number of women laborers and all semi-auxiliary laborers to participate in harvesting and threshing, in order to gain time to prepare the wheat fields. This year's wheat planting should generally maintain the past level as a standard, and all cultivated land should be strived to be fully prepared. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting, attention should be paid to seed selection and seed disinfection to avoid insect plagues and increase next year's harvest. At the same time, it should be publicized that whoever sows reaps, and timely sowing should be guaranteed.

　　太行新华日报社论号召
  　立即组织边地保秋
    【太行电】秋收即将到来，太行新华日报特根据目前豫北边地对敌斗争的特点及护麦斗争的经验发表社论，号召“立即组织保卫秋收”。指出：（一）今年护麦斗争是在比较困难与被动的条件下开始的，但由于我们执行了正确的斗争方针与部署，党政军民特别是武装部队和民兵英勇奋斗，使保卫麦收的任务胜利完成。经过麦收斗争，我边沿地区消灭了无人区与赤白对立的现象。对敌斗争的阵地及群众自卫的能力比以前大为坚强了。而蒋匪军经过我有力的军事与政治的打击，更加动摇，更加削弱了，这就改变了我们以前的被动形势，形成了现在保秋斗争的有利形势。因此边地在部署保秋斗争时，应当依据这一有利的条件，一方面进一步加强边地群众性的游击战争，发挥劳武结合的优良传统，抢收、抢耕、抢种；一方面要更主动更积极的向敌人进攻，深入敌人后方，破坏敌人的抢粮阴谋，陷敌于被动，而使我更有力的保卫边地秋收。（二）在麦收斗争中瓦解敌人，消灭赤白对立与无人区，收效很快，其中最重要的原因，就是政治攻势的开展。因此保秋斗争中仍应继续发挥政治攻势的威力。应根据解放战争两年总结，连系本区形势，宣传胜利，瓦解敌人，并组织蒋占区人民抗粮抗款斗争，揭露敌人分裂群众的阴谋。应教育蒋区人民不要中敌诡计，要互相配合应付敌人。（三）麦收斗争中政治攻势发挥巨大力量的基本原因，在于我边沿区端正了政策。因此在保秋斗争中必须继续有步骤的贯彻纠偏、端正政策，以巩固反蒋统一战线，并进一步发动群众。（四）秋收后很快种麦，我们的口号是保卫秋收，保卫种麦，保卫壮丁。快收、快打、快藏、快种，边收、边打、边藏、边种，就地晒场，随打随藏。（五）必须开好干部会议，对分区部队、县干队、区干队及民兵作必要的整顿训练，统一思想统一布置，并作充分的地雷弹药等武器准备，加强各级指挥部与情报工作。社论称：麦收斗争是胜利了，我们也有把握取得保秋斗争的胜利。但不能因胜利冲昏头脑，一切骄傲、麻痹的思想都是危险的。
    社论指出：腹地的秋收与垡地种麦，也将是一连串的比较紧张的工作，亦应抓紧领导，组织群众快收快打，争取时间垡地种麦。若干地区必然也要同时完成一定的战勤任务。因此应继续整顿与组织互助组，尽量发挥组织互助的作用，发动广大妇女劳力及所有半辅劳力参加收割打场，以便争取时间垡好麦地。今年种麦一般以保持过去的水平为准，所有耕地应争取全部垡好。秋收种麦时应注意选种及种子消毒，以避免虫灾，增加来年收成。同时应宣传谁种谁收，保证及时下种。
