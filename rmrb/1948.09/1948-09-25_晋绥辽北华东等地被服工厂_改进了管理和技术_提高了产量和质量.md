Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Clothing factories in Jin-Sui, Northeast, and East China have improved management and technology, increasing production and quality. This year, clothing factories in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area have doubled their summer military uniform production compared to previous years with the same labor and production conditions, and have completed their tasks ahead of schedule. Their experience is: First, implement joint compilation and unified leadership of production. Clothing styles, sizes, and quality are uniformly regulated, saving a lot of manpower in decentralized operations and improving technology and efficiency. Second, establish and improve factory duty, technical inspection, and other systems, clearly stipulate the standards for recording work and merit, and factory rules, etc., strengthen the workers' sense of responsibility, and enable the leadership to understand the overall production situation in a timely manner. Third, the Party and the administration cooperate closely. Production tasks are discussed by the Party's小组 [small groups], plans are made, and the exemplary role of Party members is brought into play to promote the completion of all employees. The First Clothing Factory of the Logistics Department of the Northeast Military Region, which is rushing to make winter clothes for the People's Liberation Army, promotes mutual assistance and implements scientific division of labor, exceeding the production quantity every day. It is expected to complete the original plan three days earlier; the quality has also improved, with 99% meeting the standards, compared to only 94% in the past. The Liaobei Military Region Supply Department's Clothing Factory had scattered work and wasted a lot of manpower in the past due to unscientific grouping. Now, specific division of labor has been implemented, an inspection system has been established, and three more wadding factories have been added to cooperate with the work. East China's clothing factories have also made significant achievements in improving technology and saving materials. Zhang Yushan of the cutting department repeatedly studied the clothes four or five times before cutting. He cut 5,470 sets of military uniforms, saving more than 3,100 square meters of cloth, while still meeting all the standards for size and style. In the past, the carbon, machine needles, and machine oil used for ironing in the machine department were often insufficient. Workers combined broken carbon with water, dried it, and reused it. They also used hammers instead of stones to break carbon (to produce whole pieces more easily). After the whole factory adopted this method, it saved 3,880 catties of carbon in half a year. Due to careful responsibility, 69 catties of machine oil and 1,129 machine needles were saved in half a year.

　　晋绥辽北华东等地被服工厂
  　改进了管理和技术
  　提高了产量和质量
    【新华社陕北二十日电】晋绥、东北、华东等地被服工厂改进管理，提高技术，提高了产量和质量。晋绥解放区各被服厂今年在同等劳力与生产条件下，夏季军服生产较往年增加一倍，且提前完成任务。其经验是：第一，实行合编，统一领导生产，服装式样、尺码、质量均有统一规定，节省了分散经营时的许多人工，提高了技术与效率。第二，建立和健全工厂中值日值班、技术检查等制度，明确规定记工立功和总结标准、厂规等，加强了工人的责任心，并使领导上能及时了解全盘生产情况。第三，党和行政密切配合，生产任务由党的小组进行讨论，订出计划，发扬党员模范带头作用，推动全体职工完成。正为解放军赶制冬装的东北军区军需部第一被服厂发扬互助，实行科学分工，每天超过生产数量，预讦可按原计划提早三天完成；质量也提高，合乎标准者占百分之九十九，而过去则只达到百分之九十四。辽北军区供给部被服厂过去分组不科学，以致工作散漫，人力浪费很大；现已实行具体分工，建立检查制度，并增设三个絮行厂配合工作。华东被服厂在改进技术节省材料上也有显著成绩。裁工部张玉山裁衣时反复研究四五遍才下剪，他裁军装五千四百七十套，节约布三千一百余方公尺，尺寸式样仍全合标准。机工部过去荡衣用的木炭、机针、机油常不够用，经工人把碎木炭用水合起晒干再用，又改用锤子代替石头砸木炭（易出整块）。全厂采用这办法后，半年中节约木炭三千八百八十斤。机针、机油亦因负责小心，半年内节约机油六十九斤，机针一千一百二十九支。
