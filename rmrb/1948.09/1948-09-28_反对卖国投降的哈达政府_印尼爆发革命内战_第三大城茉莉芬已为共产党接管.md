Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th—Comprehensive reports: Under the leadership of the Communist Party, a self-defense armed uprising of Indonesian patriotic people against the treasonous and capitulationist Hatta government has broken out. According to a TASS dispatch citing a Dutch news agency report from Batavia: Communists took over Madiun, a major city in Java (currently the third largest city in the Indonesian Republic region, located in eastern Java, northeast of Yogyakarta) on the 18th. Hatta government communiqués also acknowledged that regular troops in Madiun, under the leadership of the Communist Party, participated in the uprising. Various sources cite Madiun radio broadcasts on the 19th stating: The Deputy Mayor of Madiun has been appointed Chairman of the Javanese Revolutionary Government, and Colonel Zoko Suyono has been appointed Commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces; Indonesian Communist leader Muso issued a proclamation to the Indonesian people on the 19th, denouncing Sukarno and Hatta as lackeys of American and Japanese imperialism, and criticizing their implementation of treasonous and capitulationist policies for the past three years. Muso urged the people to rise up and fight for national independence. A statement broadcast by Madiun radio stated: The Sukarno-Hatta government, which has betrayed the interests of the Indonesian nation, must be overthrown and replaced by a new government that serves the interests of all the people. Five days before the Madiun uprising, on the 13th of this month, fighting broke out in Solo (northeast of Yogyakarta), the second largest city in the Indonesian Republic region; as of the 20th, armed conflicts between patriotic elements and uprising soldiers led by the Communist Party, and the Kuomintang, the Islamic Party, the Trotskyist "People's Revolutionary Movement," and the forces of Song Ke-no, who were ordered to suppress the uprising, were still ongoing in Solo.

Prior to this armed uprising of the Indonesian patriotic people, the Hatta government had first attacked the Indonesian people. On the 11th of this month, two days before the Solo fighting, the Hatta government instructed the police to "sweep" patriotic armed forces resisting the Dutch invading army in Central Java. On the 16th, two days before the Madiun uprising, Hatta delivered an anti-communist and anti-people speech to the working committee of the parliament, openly becoming an enemy of the people, and announced the release of the notorious Trotskyist leaders Chen Malujia and Sukani, who were arrested the year before, deliberately using them to alienate workers and oppose communism. On the 19th, Sukarno further ordered the arrest of Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Muso in a radio broadcast and declared martial law throughout Java. On the 20th, Sukarno obtained so-called dictatorial powers from the parliament to "resist the Communist Party." The Hatta government has now torn off its mask of democracy. In Yogyakarta alone, more than 200 democratic elements, including trade union leaders, were arrested in 24 hours. Communist and leftist newspapers in Yogyakarta have been sealed, and all public demonstrations and propaganda activities have been banned. The Hatta government's actions have been applauded and supported by American and Dutch imperialism. Dutch Foreign Minister Stiek, who recently arrived in Washington to confer with Marshall and reached an agreement, declared on the 20th: the US and the Netherlands "generally discussed how to reach a decision to help constructive elements in Indonesia (should read: treasonous and surrenderist elements)," and "invited Hatta to conclude a new agreement with the Netherlands to deal with the Communist Party and resolve Indonesia's future status." On the 21st, Dutch-Indies Governor-General Mook also hurried to leave The Hague for Batavia, and declared that "the Dutch government is prepared to support the Hatta government." Long before the Indonesian people's armed uprising, American and Dutch imperialism had been plotting to stage an anti-people coup in Indonesia. "According to London sources, one of the purposes of Dutch Foreign Minister Stiek's consultations with US Secretary of State Marshall in Washington was to report on the progress of the Netherlands in preparing for a leftist coup."

　　在共产党领导下
  　反对卖国投降的哈达政府
  　印尼爆发革命内战
    第三大城茉莉芬已为共产党接管
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】综合报导：在共产党领导之下，印尼爆发了爱国人民反对卖国投降的哈达政府的自卫武装起义。据塔斯社引荷兰通讯社巴达维亚消息：共产党已于十八日接管爪哇大城市茉莉芬（目前印尼共和国地区的第三大城，位于爪哇东部，日惹东北方向）。哈达政府公报亦承认茉莉芬的正规军在共产党领导下参加起义。各方引述茉莉芬电台十九日广播称：茉莉芬副市长已被任命为爪哇革命政府主席、左柯苏约诺上校已被任命为革命武装部队司令；印尼共产党领袖穆索于十九日发表告印尼人民书，斥责苏加诺与哈达为美、日帝国主义的奴才，斥责他们三年来执行卖国投降的政策。穆索敦促人民起来为国家的独立而斗争。茉莉芬电台广播的声明称：必须推翻出卖印尼民族利益的苏加诺——哈达政府，而代之以符合全民利益的新政府。在茉莉芬起义之前五日，即本月十三日，印尼共和国地区的第二大城市梭罗（日惹之东北）就发生了战事；截至二十日止，以共产党为首的爱国分子及起义士兵，与国民党、回教党、托派“人民革命运动”及受命镇压起义的宋柯诺所部之间的武装冲突，仍在梭罗进行中。
    在这次印尼爱国人民武装起义之前，哈达政府即首先向印尼人民进攻。本月十一日，即梭罗战事发生前两天，哈达政府即已指使警察在爪哇中部“扫荡”正在抵抗荷兰侵略军的爱国武装。至十六日，即茉莉芬起义前两日，哈达在国会工作委员会上又发表反共反人民演说，公然与人民为敌，并宣布释放前年被捕的恶名昭彰的托派头子陈马六甲和苏卡尼，蓄意利用他们来离间工人与反共。十九日，苏加诺在广播中更下令逮捕印尼共产党总书记穆索，并宣布爪哇全境戒严。二十日，苏加诺又从国会获得了所谓“抗击共产党”的独裁大权。哈达政府现已撕下民主假面具，仅在日惹，二十四小时内就逮捕了二百余民主分子，包括职工会领袖。日惹的共产党及左翼报纸已被查封，一切公共示威和宣传活动均遭禁止。哈达政府的行动获得美荷帝国主义的喝采与支持。新近抵华盛顿与马歇尔会商并获得协议的荷兰外长斯蒂克于二十日宣称：美荷“一般地讨论了怎样达到帮助印尼建设性分子（应读为卖国投降分子）的决定”，并“邀请哈达与荷兰缔结新的协议以对付共产党及解决印尼将来的地位”。二十一日，荷印总督穆克也赶忙离海牙飞巴达维亚，并声明“荷兰政府准备支持哈达政府”。远在印尼人民武装起义之前，美荷帝国主义即进行在印尼布置反人民政变的阴谋，“据伦敦方面人士谈，荷外长斯蒂克在华盛顿与美国务卿马歇尔会商目的之一，就是报告关于荷兰在准备左派分子政变一事上的进展”。（电通社伦敦二十日电）
