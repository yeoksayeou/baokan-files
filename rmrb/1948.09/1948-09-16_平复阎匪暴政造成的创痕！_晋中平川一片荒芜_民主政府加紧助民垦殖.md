　　Healing the Wounds of Yan Bandit's Tyranny!
  　A Wasteland in the Central Shanxi Plain
    Democratic Government Intensifies Efforts to Help People Reclaim Land
    [News from Central Shanxi] Under the "soldier-peasant integration" tyranny of the Yan bandits, the Central Shanxi Plain is filled with wasteland and barren seedlings, hunger, and death. In Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Wenshui, Jiaocheng, and Xugou counties alone, there are 200,000 mu of wasteland. The conscription of soldiers and laborers has led to a severe shortage of rural labor. Even the crops that were planted are indistinguishable from weeds, and the number of un-weeded barren seedlings is no less than that of wasteland. In Duancun Village in Jiaocheng District, the number of households has decreased from over 500 to only 368. More than 4,000 mu of land out of over 9,000 mu have been abandoned. For more than three years, the canals have not been repaired, and much of the irrigated land has become dry land. More than 100 households survive on wild vegetables and coarse chaff, and 86 people have already starved to death. After liberation, under the leadership of the democratic government, the village transferred 90 mu of green seedlings from the Yan bandit cooperative to poor families of military martyrs and workers. They collected Yan puppet materials and exchanged them for 2,000 jin of wheat, helping to solve the problem of food and seeds for more than 90 households, and organized more than 60 households to sell fruits and vegetables. The stationed organs helped with weeding and donated vegetable seeds, allowing the green seedlings mixed in with the weeds to grow. They also planted late crops on over 600 mu of wasteland. The "soldier-peasant integration" disrupted the original land relations, and those who were not of age could not receive any land. After liberation, it was announced that this tyranny would be abolished, and the issue of green seedlings is being actively handled by the leadership to help the original households and the current land cultivators to negotiate. In Renyan, Xiaoxiangzhai, Shangxiachijiazhuang and other four villages in Fenyang, there are a total of 9,550 mu of wasteland, accounting for 4.7 percent of the total land. After liberation, the county sent special personnel to lead, and organized labor teams from the mountains and other villages in the plain. Dozens of livestock were organized from the mountains, and three sheng of wheat were given for cultivating one mu. Together with the livestock in the village, more than 3,000 mu of autumn vegetables and late-harvest crops were rushed to be planted. There are still more than 6,000 mu, and a large number of women and children are being mobilized to pull up artemisia grass in preparation for planting wheat. (Qiao Huafu)
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 13th - The vast rural areas of the new Central Shanxi district are stepping up reclamation and plowing to restore production. Under the Yan bandit's "soldier-peasant integration" tyranny in the district, most of the land was barren, and half of the people were in famine. According to statistics from Fenyang, Wenshui, Xiaoyi, Jiaocheng, Xugou and other five counties, there are more than 200,000 mu of wasteland and more than 300,000 mu of autumn fields that have not been weeded. The Central Shanxi Second Special District Office (under the jurisdiction of Fenyang, Wenshui, Jiaocheng and other seven counties) issued an urgent instruction in the middle of last month: mobilize all military and civilian labor forces that can be used for production to reclaim wasteland and plow wheat fields to ensure that everyone in the new district sows one mu of wheat on time to survive the spring famine next year; county and district cadres and work groups should immediately go to the villages to organize production committees to lead the plowing of wasteland and wheat stubble fields, adjust land, and ensure that whoever plants it harvests it. At present, democratic governments in various places have organized many work groups to go deep into the countryside to lead production, mobilize women and children to rush to weed and plant, and solve difficulties such as food and seeds by using some of the captured materials and mobilizing the masses to help each other. Autumn crops have been generally weeded, and one-third of the wasteland has been reclaimed to plant late autumn crops.
    [News from Central Shanxi] Last year in Shouyang County, under the rule of the Yan bandits, in addition to using "self-confession and rebirth" and "slaughter and suppression" to brutally kill innocent people, they also carried out arbitrary levies, conscription, and looting, resulting in sparse population and barren land in the countryside. Especially in the first and second districts, many people died due to hunger, cold, exhaustion, and lack of money for treatment. In Xigongyi Village alone, 91 people died within a few months. After this liberation, one often sees corpses buried in the rural areas, and many people are still struggling with diseases.
    Due to the increase in the number of patients and the death rate, coupled with the Yan bandits' frantic conscription, good farmland is barren everywhere. Duangwang Village has a total of 2,200 mu of land, of which more than 900 mu are barren. Shuangjiaquan Village was turned into a no-man's land by the Yan bandits, and all the land was abandoned. In Luojiazhuang, Zhangjiazhuang and other areas, although the masses planted green seedlings due to the Yan bandits' looting when they fled, they were generally not weeded.
    After this liberation, the masses have been crying out about the persecution they suffered from the Yan bandits. The masses in the second district said: "That Yan Xishan, that beggar, robbed the common people of all their grain. Wheat was requisitioned when it was green, grain was robbed in June and July, grain was 'requisitioned' in August and September, it was transferred in October and November, and 'self-confession and rebirth' in December and January, and it was all gone by March."
    In order to relieve the suffering of the masses, the Shouyang Democratic Government immediately issued an emergency notice, deciding to dispatch doctors from various places to concentrate in the first and second districts to treat the masses, and the County Medical Cooperative transported a batch of medicines to be sold on credit to the masses who could not afford the medicine. It also mobilized manpower and animal power in various districts to help cultivate the first and second districts. The county government has now allocated 6,500 jin of relief grain to the first and second districts to help farmers who have no food.

　　平复阎匪暴政造成的创痕！
  　晋中平川一片荒芜
    民主政府加紧助民垦殖
    【晋中讯】在阎匪的“兵农合一”暴政下，晋中平川到处是荒地荒苗，饥饿死亡。汾阳、孝义、文水、交城、徐沟五县，即有荒地二十万亩。抽兵抓丁，使农村劳动力奇缺，种上的庄稼，草苗不分，没锄的荒苗也不少于荒地。交城一区段村过去有五百多户，现在只有三六八户。九千多亩土地就荒了四千多亩。三年多了，水渠不加修整，水地多变为旱地。百余户人家靠吃野菜粗糠度日，已饿死八十六人。解放后在民主政府领导下，该村才将阎匪合作社的九十亩青苗调剂给贫苦的军工烈属与农民，搜集阎伪物资，变成麦子二千斤，帮助解决了九十多户的口粮籽种，组织了六十多户担卖水果瓜菜。驻地机关帮工锄地，捐助菜籽，使混在草中的青苗得以长成，又把荒地六百余亩种上晚作物。“兵农合一”把原有的土地关系打乱，不合年龄的领不到一点土地；解放后宣布废除这一暴政，青苗问题正由领导上积极帮助原地户和现种地户商量处理。汾阳仁岩、小相寨、上下池家庄等四个村，共有荒地九五五零亩，占全部土地百分之四点七。解放后，县上派专人领导，由山上及平川其他村组织扎工队，由山上组织下来牲口数十头，耕一亩给三升麦。连本村牲口，共抢种秋菜及晚收作物三千多亩。尚有六千多亩，正发动大批妇女儿童拔蒿草，准备种麦。　　　　　　（乔华甫）
    【新华社晋绥十三日电】晋中新区广大农村加紧垦荒翻地，恢复生产。该区在阎匪“兵农合一”暴政下，土地大部荒芜，有一半人民陷于饥馑。据汾阳、文水、孝义、交城、徐沟等五县统计，共有荒地二十多万亩，尚未锄过的秋田有三十余万亩。晋中二专署（辖汾阳、文水、交城等七县）于上月中旬发出紧急指示：动员军民全部可资生产的劳动力垦荒翻麦地，保证新区每人按期下种小麦一亩，以渡过明年春荒；县区干部及工作团应立即到各村组织生产委员会领导翻荒地及麦楂地，调剂土地，保证谁种谁收。现各地民主政府已组织了许多工作组，深入乡村领导生产，动员妇女儿童突击抢锄抢种，并以部分缴获物资和发动群众互济，解决口粮、种籽等困难。现秋禾已普遍锄过，并开垦了三分之一的荒地种晚秋作物。
    【晋中讯】寿阳县去年在阎匪统治下，除去以“自白转生”，“屠杀镇压”来残杀无辜的群众外，还进行横征暴敛抓丁抢掠。弄的农村中人稀地荒。特别在一、二两区，群众因饥寒交迫，困累成疾，又无钱治疗，死亡的人很多。仅西安公一村数月内即死去九十一人。这次解放后，在农村里经常看到无人掩埋的死尸，很多群众仍在疾病中挣扎。
    由于病人及死亡率的增加，加上阎匪疯狂的抓丁，因此到处良田荒芜。段王村共有二千二百亩地，即荒了九百多亩。双家泉村被阎匪造成无人区，土地全部荒了。罗家庄、张家庄一带由于阎匪逃跑时的劫掠群众虽然种上青苗，普遍还未锄过。
    这次解放后，群众都纷纷哭诉阎匪对他们的迫害，二区群众说：“阎锡山那个讨吃鬼，抢的老百姓一点粮也没有了，麦子青绿就征收，六、七月里是抢粮的，八、九月里是‘征粮’的，十月、十一月是转移，腊月正月是‘自白转生’，转到三月里就转光了。”
    寿阳民主政府为解救群众的灾难，即发出紧急通知，决定从各地抽调医生，集中到一、二区给群众治疗疾病，县医联社运了一批药材，赊给出不起药钱的群众。并在各区动员人力、畜力到一、二区助耕，县政府现已拨给一、二区六千五百斤赈粮，救济没饭吃的农民。（赵政邦、孙国庆、张宏道、阎世忠、李良秀）
