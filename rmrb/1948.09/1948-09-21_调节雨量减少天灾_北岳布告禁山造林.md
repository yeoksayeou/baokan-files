　　Regulating Rainfall to Reduce Natural Disasters
  　Northern Yue Proclamation Bans Mountain Clearing and Afforestation
    [Northern Yue Dispatch] The Northern Yue Administrative Office issued a proclamation on September 6th regarding the prohibition of mountain clearing and afforestation, stating: "Droughts, floods, wind, and hail are the greatest threats to agricultural production. The Northern Yue region loses no less than one million *shi* annually due to these disasters, greatly affecting the national economy and the people's livelihoods. The fundamental reason lies in the scarcity of trees and the abundance of sand and stones, leading to climate imbalance and unfavorable weather. Only by prohibiting mountain clearing and extensively afforesting can we regulate rainfall and reduce natural disasters. However, some people, seeking temporary gains, are clearing mountains everywhere, cutting down trees in large quantities, and even setting fire to slopes, destroying forests. This is extremely detrimental to economic development and increased production. For the long-term interests of the people, all counties and districts must earnestly educate the masses to implement the prohibition of mountain clearing and afforestation." The methods are: (1) For all uncultivated mountain land, regardless of slope or soil thickness, from now on, planting trees and afforestation should be universally promoted, and clearing land for cultivation should be prohibited. Those whose livelihoods are insufficient due to the prohibition of mountain clearing will be assisted by the government to develop sideline occupations or resettled on the plains. (2) All reclaimed mountain land that can be managed long-term should be terraced and cultivated intensively. Those that can only be cultivated temporarily should be planted with trees to gradually transform them into forest areas. (3) It is strictly forbidden to indiscriminately cut down trees. Before trees mature, sparse trees may only have branches trimmed occasionally, and dense trees may only be felled according to plan. After trees mature, felling must be approved by the government, and replanting must be carried out on the original site after felling. (4) It is strictly forbidden to set fire to mountains. Those who violate the law and cause damage will be required to replant or restore the vegetation for minor offenses, and those who commit serious offenses will be subject to criminal penalties. (5) All prohibited mountains and forests must not be arbitrarily cut down. Grazing must be allowed according to regulations based on the size of the trees. Illegal damage should be compensated, or appropriate punishment should be given. (6) Each village must establish a forest protection agreement and conduct regular mass education.

　　调节雨量减少天灾
  　北岳布告禁山造林
    【北岳电】北岳行署于九月六日发出关于禁山造林布告称：水旱风雹为农业生产之最大危害，北岳全区每年因此减产不下一百万石，影响国计民生甚大。其根本原因，在于树木过少，沙石太多，以致气候失调，风雨不顺。只有禁止开山，广泛造林，才能调节雨量，减少天灾。而部分群众因图一时之利，到处开山，大量砍树，甚至放火烧坡，破坏林木，这对发展经济，增加生产极为不利。为人民长久利益着想，各县区务须切实教育群众实行禁山造林。其办法：（一）凡未开垦之山地，不论坡度大小土层厚薄，自今以后普遍提倡植树造林，禁止开荒种地。其因禁止开山而生活不足者，由政府扶助开展副业，或于平川招垦安置。（二）凡已开垦堰山地可以长期经营者，均应修成梯田，实行精耕细作。只能暂时耕种者，即加种树木，逐渐改为林区。（三）严禁滥伐树木，树未成材以前，稀者只许以时加枝，密者只许按照计划砍伐，树已成材之后，伐前须由政府批准，砍后须就原地补栽。（四）严禁放火烧山，违法破坏者，轻的令其补栽补种，重者酌予刑事处分。（五）一切禁山禁林，不得任意砍伐，放牧须按林木大小规定开放办法，违法破坏应令补偿，或予适当处分。（六）各村须定护林公约，经常进行群众教育。
