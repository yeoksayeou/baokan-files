Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th—The Fangzi Public Coal Mine in Weifang City, Shandong Province, has actively improved its equipment, resulting in increased production in the three months since liberation, and saving a large amount of manpower. The daily output has now reached 467 tons, and the average daily output per person has increased by 3.3 tons compared to the enemy-occupied period last year. When mining began after the liberation of Fangzi, while mining coal in the mine, more than 50% of the labor force was used for opening coal mining tunnels, repairing old tunnels, replacing supports, adjusting air ducts, blocking areas with fire hazards, and establishing connecting roadways between various wells. This was a great waste of manpower. Now, the mine is vigorously improving equipment. The fifth well has broken through the dozens of meters of rock layer that could not be penetrated during the enemy occupation and has built 66 meters of railway, saving at least 60 man-days per day. The third well has solved the problem of ventilation regulation that could not be solved during the German, Japanese, and Chiang Kai-shek periods by installing a new electric winch and an electric fan. In addition, the mine is an old mine with many cracks in the ground wells. During the rainy season, large amounts of water seep into the strata, and the tunnels are easily flooded. Last year, work was suspended for half a year. This year, eight water pumps were added inside and outside the wells, and dikes and canals were built on the ground, so normal mining is possible during the rainy season. The water pool of the first well was silted up with mud and broken bricks and tiles to a depth of two feet. When the boiler pumped water, it often brought in mud, causing the boiler to rust two or three inches thick and consuming 20 tons of coal per day. After the workers thoroughly cleaned the pool and scrubbed the boiler, only 16 tons of coal were needed per day. In the past, after the coal was pulled out of the cage in the second well, it was dumped in the yard. After the company sold it, it was moved out of the yard basket by basket, which wasted a lot of manpower. Now, as a result of the improvement, the coal can be directly transported out of the yard after being pulled out of the cage, saving 40 man-days per day.

### 华东坊子公营煤矿改进设备产量增加

　　华东坊子公营煤矿改进设备产量增加
    【新华社华东十一日电】潍坊市坊子公营煤矿，由于积极改进设备，解放后三个月来产量增加，且节省大批人力。现每日产量已达四六七吨，每人每日平均产量较去年敌占时增加百分之三点三吨。解放坊子后开始采煤时，井内一面采煤，一面则要以百分之五十以上的人工用于开辟采煤坑道、修整旧坑道、拆换支柱、调整风道、堵塞有火患危险地区、建立各井联系巷道等，人力浪费甚大。现在矿方大力改善设备，第五井将敌占时未能通过的十几米达的石层凿通，并增筑铁路六十六米，每日至少可节省六十个人工；第三井由于新装电绞车及电风车各一部，解决了在德人、日寇至蒋匪时期均未能解决的风气调剂问题。此外，该矿因系老矿，地面井眼裂痕很多，每逢雨季，大水渗入地层，坑道动辄被淹，去年即曾有半年未能工作，今年在井内及井口增设抽水机八部，并于地面筑堤修渠，故雨季仍能照常开采。一井的水池原被淤泥及碎砖乱瓦淤塞有二尺深，锅炉抽水时往往将泥带进，致使锅炉生锈有二三寸厚，每日费煤二十吨，经工人彻底清扫水池，洗刷锅炉后，每日只需煤十六吨即可。第二井过去把煤从灌笼里拉出来后，倒在场子里，公司卖好后，再一筐一筐的搬到场外，极浪费人力，现经改进结果，煤从灌笼拉出可直运场外，每日可节省人工四十个。
