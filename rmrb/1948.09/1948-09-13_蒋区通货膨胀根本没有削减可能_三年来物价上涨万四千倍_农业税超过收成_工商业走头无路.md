Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. An article in the "Observer" magazine of Shanghai, Volume 4, Nos. 23 and 24, entitled "China's Economy in the Past Seven Months," provides noteworthy figures on the economic situation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the past six months or so. The article states that in the less than three years since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, prices in the Kuomintang area have risen more than 14,000 times. The main reason for this price increase is inflation, and "inflation has no possibility of reduction at all, so there is absolutely no hope of easing the economic crisis." Regarding the agricultural situation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the article says: In agriculture, "one mu of land must yield one shi of taxes, at the very least five or six dou. How can people survive when taxes exceed the harvest? In addition to the drought in Guangdong, Anhui, Henan and other provinces in the spring, the recent floods in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces have affected 20 million people and caused a loss of 100 million dan of grain, exceeding 11% of the total national grain output last year." In industry, "there are frequent reports of reduced production in the textile industry. According to a survey by the Shanghai Cotton Textile Association, factories have only 20 days of cotton in stock, so they have reduced work by 20%. More small and medium-sized textile mills have stopped production. The woolen textile industry only operates for 11 or 12 days a month, and the underwear industry has reduced production by one-third. The cigarette industry produced 175,000 boxes last December, but less than 100,000 boxes this June. 30% of the rubber industry has stopped production, and others are barely maintaining production with reduced output. Half of the match industry has shut down. 70% of steel manufacturers are in a state of semi-shutdown. In addition to the threat of Japanese goods recently poured into the Chinese market like crazy, industrial and commercial sales are sluggish, and there is no way out." "The wealthy are fleeing abroad with large amounts of capital. Chinese deposits in Hong Kong and other places have reached 1.5 billion Hong Kong dollars (approximately 285 million US dollars). Those running factories are relocating their factories to the south. Last year, 20% of the newly registered factories in Hong Kong were relocated from the mainland. From January to May this year, of the 180 or 190 newly registered factories, more than 60% were relocated from the mainland." Regarding the impact of the Sino-US bilateral agreement, the article states: "US aid has brought 'bilateral agreements,' which is equivalent to abandoning the policy of protective tariffs, further colonizing China, and failing to solve the financial difficulties; while controls only promote the flight of capital to the south, block the transshipment of goods, fuel price increases, sacrifice small and medium-sized manufacturers, and concentrate wealth in the hands of a few people once again."

　　蒋区通货膨胀根本没有削减可能
  　三年来物价上涨万四千倍
    农业税超过收成·工商业走头无路
    【新华社陕北十日电】上海“观察”杂志第四卷第二十三、四期所载“七个月来的中国经济”一文，对近半年多来国民党统治区的经济情况供给了可注意的数字。该文称抗战胜利后不满三年国民党区物价已上涨一万四千多倍，此种物价上涨的主要原因为通货膨胀，而“通货膨胀根本没有削减可能，从而经济危机也绝无缓和的希望”。该文在论及国民党统治区的农业状况时说：在农业方面，“一亩地要出一石捐税，最低也要五六斗，赋税超过了收成，怎叫人民活得下去？加上春间粤、皖、豫等省旱灾，最近粤、桂、闽、赣、鄂、湘、川、皖、苏九省的水灾，受灾人民达二千万，捐失粮食一万万担，总数超过去年全国粮食总产量百分之十一以上。”在工业方面，“纺织业减产之声时有所闻。上海棉纺公会调查，各厂只有二十天存棉，乃减工百分之二十，中小纺织业停工的更多。毛纺工业每月只开工十一、二天，内衣工业已减产三分之一；卷烟业去年十二月产十七万五千箱，今年六月不足十万箱；橡胶业停工三成，其他亦在减产勉强维持中；火柴业停业一半；钢铁工业有百分之七十厂家陷于半停工状态。加上最近疯狂投入中国市场的日货威胁，工商业实销清淡，走头无路。”“富豪们则将大量资金逃往国外，香港等地，华人存款即达十五亿港币（约合美金二亿八千五百万元）。办工业的人则将工厂南迁，去年香港新登记之工厂中有百分之二十是国内迁去，今年一月至五月新登记之工厂一百八、九十家，有百分之六十以上是国内南迁的。”关于中美双边协定的影响，该文称：“美援带来了‘双边协定’，等于放弃了保护关税政策，使中国更进一步殖民地化，解救不了财政困难；而管制只有促进资金南逃，阻塞商品转运，助长物价上涨，牺牲中小厂家，财富再度向少数人集中。”
