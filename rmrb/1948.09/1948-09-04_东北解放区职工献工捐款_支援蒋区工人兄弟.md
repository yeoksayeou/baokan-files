　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 30th. Workers in various parts of the Northeast Liberated Area have recently launched a fervent campaign to support their worker brothers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. In the past week, the All-China Federation of Labor has received more than a dozen letters and telegrams from workers in the Northeast military industry and various factories under the Military Industry Department, and from trade unions of various enterprises in Harbin, responding to the call of the conference to donate one day of voluntary labor to support workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, as well as donations of over 29.8 million yuan for voluntary labor. Workers and shop assistants in various industries in Harbin have also launched a wave of donations to express sympathy, with workers and shop assistants in Daowai District donating over 56 million yuan in three days. Workers in various private factories have also made generous donations. Workers at Lao Bana Tobacco Company donated 4.32 million yuan, and workers at Yichangtai, Shuanghesheng, and three other flour mills donated over 4.22 million yuan. In the enthusiastic donations, most of the factory workers exceeded the call for one day of voluntary labor. Wu Shanglou, a shop assistant at a department store, voluntarily donated seven days' wages. Lu Yaoting, a young worker at the Northeast Electric Power Bureau's battery factory, said at the donation meeting: "Workers all over the world are one family and should help each other. Not to mention just one day of voluntary labor, even five days is not too much. I am willing to do ten days of voluntary labor and give ten days' wages to my worker brothers in the KMT-controlled areas to help them fight Chiang Kai-shek to the death. In addition, I will take out that 14,000 yuan in overtime pay to support the front lines." Comrade Liu Yingyuan, a famous labor hero in the Northeast, although with a heavy family burden, also donated one-third of his August salary. Workers in various factories in Heilongjiang Province have also launched an aid campaign, with workers in only the Bei'an Textile Factory, Leather Factory, and Sack Factory donating over 2.3 million yuan.

　　东北解放区职工献工捐款
  　支援蒋区工人兄弟
    【新华社东北三十日电】东北解放区各地职工，近热烈展开支援国民党统治区工人兄弟的运动。过去一周间，全国六次劳动大会即收到东北军事工业及军工部两办事处所属各厂工人、哈市各企业之职工会响应大会号召作义务工一天以支援国民党统治区职工的函电十数件，及义务工之献款两千九百八十余万元。哈市各行业工友并已掀起捐款慰问的热潮，道外区的工友店员三日之间即捐款达五千六百余万元。各私营工厂的工人们也纷纷捐助。老巴拿烟草公司工人捐款四百三十二万元，义昌泰、双合盛等五家面粉厂工友捐献四百二十余万元。各厂职工们在踊跃捐献中，大多数超过了献义务工一天的号召。百货店员吴尚楼自愿献出七天的工资。东北电业局蓄电池厂青年工人卢耀庭在献金大会上说：“天下工人是一家，应该帮助，莫说才一天的义务工，就是五天也不多。我愿意做十天的义务工，把十天的工资送给蒋管区工友兄弟，帮助他们向蒋介石作生死的斗争。另外我把那一万四千元加工的工资拿出来支援前线。”东北著名劳动英雄刘英源同志虽家庭负担甚重，亦献出八月份的工资三分之一。黑龙江省各工厂工友亦展开援助运动，仅北安纺织厂、皮革厂、麻袋工厂等三个厂工友即捐款二百三十余万元。
