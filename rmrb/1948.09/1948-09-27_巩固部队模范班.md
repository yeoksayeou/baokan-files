Model Platoon for Strengthening the Troops
    Zhang Kerang
    The 4th Platoon of the Machine Gun Company of a certain unit of the Taiyuan Military Region, with three Party members out of ten soldiers, and under the leadership of Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua and Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Hongshun, experienced no desertions, casualties, or illnesses during the Jinzhong Campaign. At the celebration meeting on August 15th, the commander personally awarded them the red banner and honorary title of "Model Platoon for Strengthening the Troops," and the entire platoon collectively received a commendation.
    During the thirty-six days of the Jinzhong Campaign, they participated in twelve major battles, completing their tasks successfully in each one. Furthermore, due to the careful planning and flexible command of Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua and Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Hongshun, their care for the soldiers on the battlefield, and the timely reviews after battles, the platoon suffered no casualties. During the Chewang battle, they followed the 1st Battalion to attack the enemy near friendly forces. Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua personally scouted the terrain ahead and led them forward with individual leaps. Although the enemy's firepower was fierce, they passed through safely. In the Wumaqiao battle, the heavy machine gun was only thirty or forty meters away from the enemy, and the soldiers were very nervous. Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua and Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Hongshun personally crawled forward to scout the terrain and helped everyone build fortifications for cover. The enemy couldn't find their target and fired machine guns, rifles, and artillery at them, with more than a dozen mortar shells landing around them, but none of them were injured. When attacking the enemy in Xifan, a soldier stood up to look at the enemy. Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua pulled the soldier down to find cover, and just as they hid, a burst of machine-gun fire came over. When the troops arrived at Wangjiazhai, it was almost dawn. The higher-ups ordered them to dig fortifications. Four members of the platoon suffered from eye problems, and everyone was afraid that digging would aggravate their condition, so they didn't let them dig. As a result, in two hours, six people dug two bunkers. During the attack on Beilai, they were very close to the enemy, making it easy to be detected, and they couldn't stay in one position for long. They made four fortifications in five hours and constantly changed positions. The soldiers in the platoon said, "If it weren't for our platoon leader and deputy platoon leader, we wouldn't know what would have happened to us." At the same time, because they were meticulous, thorough, and frequent in their review of actions after each battle, such as Shi Haixiang standing up to look at the enemy in the Xifan battle, everyone criticized him during the review. Shi Haixiang said with emotion, "Our platoon really cares about me; if it weren't for the platoon leader, I would have been done for." In this way, unfavorable actions in combat were overcome, avoiding casualties.
    During the Jinzhong Campaign, thanks to the care and good management and education of the platoon leader and deputy platoon leader, the 4th Platoon not only experienced no desertions (from March until now), but also had no seriously ill members during the Jinzhong Campaign, consolidating their combat effectiveness. Four members of the platoon suffered from eye problems. Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua and Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Hongshun, fearing that their condition would worsen and reduce their combat effectiveness, personally dug air-raid shelters and built covers for them. When finding houses, they always let the soldiers sleep on the heated brick beds, while they took care of the guns in the courtyard. On the front lines, they always let the soldiers rest in covered areas, taking turns watching the guns themselves. For comrades with weak bodies, the platoon leader and deputy platoon leader helped carry their belongings and carried more guns. The soldiers said, "Our platoon leader and deputy platoon leader love us like our own brothers; what are we afraid of!" During this campaign, Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua often read the news to everyone, reporting good news and encouraging everyone's spirits, so that the soldiers did not feel distressed. Therefore, the soldiers said, "When the platoon leader reported the good news, I don't know why, but I was very happy!" They also did a good job of assigning tasks for explanation. The three Party members in the platoon each helped two non-Party members, holding individual talks every three to five days. In this way, the Party's prestige was enhanced, and the relationship between the masses and the Party members became closer, making the whole platoon more united. For example, Wang Xucheng helped Chen Honggao. Chen wanted to go home and said to Wang, "I'm afraid we won't be able to go back there. Let's go back earlier." Wang immediately explained to Chen, "We are the People's Liberation Army. If we don't defeat Yan Xishan, we can't live there. If we want to live a good life, we must first defeat Yan Xishan." Although Chen Honggao attempted to desert twice, no one in the platoon ever said he "wanted to desert," nor did they criticize him. They always used self-criticism and commendation of merits in platoon meetings to carry out edification. In this way, Chen was moved and revealed his ideological burden: "If it weren't for the care of the platoon leader and everyone, I would have left long ago...." "I tried to desert, but the platoon leader and comrades didn't say I wanted to desert. I can't do it again. How can I be worthy of the platoon leader and everyone!" Once, when they arrived at a certain village, it was almost dawn. The soldiers went to sleep, and Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Hongshun boiled water for everyone to wash their feet, wash their faces, and drink. Because the platoon leader and deputy platoon leader took good care of the soldiers, everyone's spirit of unity was very high, like brothers. When marching, they carried things for each other and fought to carry the machine guns. Although it was the hot summer season, and they were marching and fighting day and night, they were all energetic and successfully completed their combat missions.

　　巩固部队模范班
    张克让
    太原军区某部机炮连四班，全班十个人有三个党员，在班长王建华、副班长张鸿顺的领导下，在晋中战役中没逃亡、没伤亡、没病号，八月十五日庆功会上，司令员亲授了“巩固部队模范”班的红锦旗和光荣称号，全班集体立了功。
    在晋中战役的三十六天中，他们参加了十二次较主要的战斗，在这十二次的战斗中，都圆满的完成了他们的任务，并且由于班长王建华同志副班长张鸿顺同志精心计划，指挥灵活，战场爱兵和战后的及时检讨，全班没有一个伤亡。车辋战斗时，他们随一营出击攻我友邻的敌人，班长王建华同志亲自到前面看好了地形，以个个跃进带上去，当时敌人的火力虽然打的很凶，但他们却安全的通过了。在五马桥战斗时，重机枪离敌人只三、四十米远，战士们很慌张，班长王建华同志副班长张鸿顺同志亲自爬到前面看了地形，又给大家做好工事隐蔽了。敌人找不见他们的目标，机枪、步枪、炮向他们打来，在他们周围落了十几个迫击炮弹，但他们都没有一个被打伤。攻击西范敌人时，一个战士站着看敌人，班长王建华拉着那个战士找下隐蔽地，刚隐蔽了，敌人的一梭子机枪即打了过来。部队到王家寨，天就快亮了。上级让挖工事，他们班有四个害眼病的，大家怕他们挖的上了火，更厉害了，不让他们挖，结果在两个钟头内，六个人挖好了两个地堡。打北赖时因距敌人很近，容易被敌人发觉，不能常在一个位置，他们即在五个小时内做好了四个工事，经常变换位置，这样班里的战士们说：“要不是咱们班长副班长，咱们还不知怎样了。”同时因为他们在每次战后对动作的检讨细致、深刻、经常，如史海祥在西范战斗站起来看敌人，大家在检讨时给了他个批评。史海祥感动的说：“咱们班真爱我，要不是班长，我就完了。”这样，就使战斗上不利的动作克服了，避免了伤亡。
    晋中战役中，四班由于班长副班长爱兵和管理教育的好，不但没逃亡（从三月到现在）甚至在晋中战役中没有一个重病员，巩固了战斗力。班里有四个害眼病的，班长王建华和副班长张鸿顺怕他们上了火，眼病厉害了减少战斗力，他俩亲自给他们挖防空洞，做掩体。在找下房子时每次都是让战士们睡在炕上，自己在院子里照料枪。在阵地上，他俩总是让战士们在隐蔽地休息，自己轮流看枪。班里有身体弱的同志，每次行军正副班长照顾背东西。还要多扛枪，战士们说：“咱们正副班长就象咱的亲兄弟一样爱咱们，咱们还怕什么！”在这次战役中，班长王建华时常给大家念报，报告好消息，鼓动大家的情绪，使战士们不感到苦脑，因此战士们说：“班长给报告了好消息，心眼里不知怎么，可高兴哩！”他们分工解释也做的好，班里三个党员每人分工帮助两个群众，隔三五天即个别谈一次话，这样党的威信提高了，使群众和党员关系也密切了，使全班团结的更好。如王绪成帮助陈鸿皋，陈想回家就对王说：“这怕回不了咱那里了，咱早些回吧。”王马上给陈解释说：“咱们是人民的解放军，不把阎锡山打败，回去也在不住，要想过好光景，那就得先把阎锡山打败。”虽然陈鸿皋两次企图开小差，但班里总没人说过他“想开小差”，也没有批评过，总是在班务会上用检讨思想，表扬好处，进行感化的，这样使陈感动的揭开了自己的思想包袱：“我要不是班长和大家的关心早走了……。”“我企图开小差，班长和同志们还不说是想开小差，咱可再不了，怎样对得起班长和大家哩！”一次到某村时，天快亮了，战士们睡了，副班长张鸿顺同志给大家烧下开水，洗足、洗脸、喝。由于班长副班长照顾战士周到，大家团结的情绪非常高，象亲兄弟，行起军来就互相背东西，争着扛机枪，虽然是暑伏天，又加日夜行军打仗，但他们个个精神旺盛，胜利地完成了战斗务任。
