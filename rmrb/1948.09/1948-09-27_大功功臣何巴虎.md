　　Heroic Merit Citation Recipient He Bahu
　　Comrade He Bahu, a recipient of a citation for great merit, is the squad leader of the second machine gun squad of the fourth company of the 914th regiment of a certain unit. After joining the army, he received education from the Party, his class consciousness was raised, he was active and responsible in his work, brave and calm in battle, and held infinite loyalty to the Party and the people. In the Shangzhuang battle to defend spring ploughing and the Xifancun battle in the Jinzhong Campaign, he disregarded his own safety in the most dangerous and difficult circumstances, twice covering the main force to successfully complete its mission.
　　On May 8th, the entire 49th Division of the Yan bandit launched a multi-pronged attack on my Mengxian border. Zhao Junyi, the deputy division commander and commander of the first regiment of the division (who was captured in the Beishangshe battle on May 9th), bought off local ruffians with three silver dollars a day to form a "Black Tiger Team" and launched a fierce attack on the fourth company's position guarding Shangzhuang Village on the Shoumeng border, thus beginning a fierce battle. A battalion of Yan bandits launched assaults in several directions and engaged our company's soldiers in fierce hand-to-hand combat with bayonets. The enemy rushed up throwing grenades and engaging in bayonet charges, and were beaten back three times. In these three melee combats, He Bahu showed unparalleled bravery. He held his machine gun and fired fiercely at the enemy rushing in from the flanks, firing six bursts of ammunition, killing a large number of enemies, preventing them from rushing up, and ensuring the safety of the main force's flank. But when he retreated, the enemy had already rushed up and blocked his way. He fired back at the enemy with his machine gun and jumped into a ditch. Seeing that our two wounded soldiers' guns were unattended, he picked them up and started walking. The enemy blocked his way again. Bahu, carrying two rifles and a machine gun, detoured. By this time it was already dark. Because he was avoiding the enemy, he lost his way in the middle of the night and started going around in circles on the mountain. He thought: "Am I deserting the battle by leaving the unit? No! I covered the main force to retreat, but I couldn't get down because the enemy blocked my way! And I saw the revolutionary weapons about to be lost, wouldn't it be wrong not to carry them? I am a member of the branch committee! The situation is unclear everywhere, where can I find the troops? I would rather die than be captured, this is the quality of a Communist Party member!" After thinking it over, he decided to break through the encirclement at night and escape, and look for the troops in the direction of Mengcheng. He went up the mountain and got his bearings, then started walking, but who knew that the direction of Mengcheng had already been occupied by the enemy, sandwiching Bahu on the hillside. Before dawn, machine guns and cannons were firing intensely, and he watched the enemy running back and forth, getting closer and closer to him. He wondered: "How can I break out? Can I keep these machine guns and rifles?" Finally, he made up his mind to hide the machine gun and one rifle on the hillside, and fight the enemy with one rifle himself! As soon as he hid the gun, he saw that the enemy was surrounded by us and fighting each other. He was extremely happy. Although he hadn't eaten anything for a whole day and night, he still perked up and took the opportunity to kill his way up the mountain again, killing three enemies and joining the main force.
　　On the morning of July 12th, the troops woke up from their sleep and set off running. Due to the urgency of the situation, the orders were very simple: "The enemies in Nanzhuang, Dachang, and Xiaochang are now surrounded by us, and only the southwest corner of Xifan is to be the responsibility of our regiment." The troops immediately ran to the designated direction, but unexpectedly, the situation developed and tens of thousands of enemies in Xifan were breaking out from here. The vanguard troops had already captured prisoners and opened fire. The situation was tense, and the main force of the regiment had not yet had time to deploy. The enemy attacked from three sides, and three airplanes came to harass us. The troops in front retreated, and the soldiers of the fourth company accepted the arduous task of "quickly counter-attacking and repelling the enemy! Resolutely prevent the enemy from breaking out from here" in this tense atmosphere. As soon as Deputy Battalion Commander Hu's order was issued, the enemy's artillery shells, bullets, and machine gun bullets from the planes concentrated on our position, and the soldiers felt a little uneasy. Comrade He Bahu picked up his machine gun and fired two bursts of ammunition. After this attack, the enemy turned around and ran away. Then, squad leader Pan Cunshan and Cao Jucai took the lead in rushing up, and the first and seventh squads also rushed up. At this time, He Bahu was even more fearless. In order to ensure the safety of the charging troops, he still held his machine gun and was with the assault troops, preventing the enemy from launching several counter-attacks, leaving behind corpses, banners, and weapons, and fleeing back to their original entrenched Ditch in a panic, no longer daring to act fiercely. In this fierce battle, He Bahu's machine gun fired more than 700 rounds of ammunition, and the gun barrel turned red. Comrade Bahu's heart also calmed down, and the entire regiment turned from danger to safety. The dream of tens of thousands of enemies in Xifan to break out was dealt a head-on blow, and they no longer wanted to break out. (Zhang Kerang, Wang Zhiguo)

　　大功功臣何巴虎
    大功功臣何巴虎同志是某部九一四团四连二机枪班班长。入伍后，受到党的教育，阶级觉悟提高，工作积极负责，战斗勇敢沉着，对党、对人民抱着无限忠心。在保卫春耕中的上庄战斗和晋中战役中的西范村战斗，他在最危难艰苦的环境下，奋不顾身，两次掩护主力胜利完成任务。
    五月八日，阎匪四十九师全部向我盂县边界分路进攻，该师副师长兼一团团长赵俊义（五月九日，北上社战斗已被俘虏）以一天三块白洋收买了兵痞流氓，组成一个“黑虎队”，向我寿盂边界上庄村担任警戒的四连阵地猛烈冲击，激烈的战斗就此开始。阎匪一个营的兵力分数路冲锋上来，和我连健儿展开了肉搏白刃战。敌人冲上来就拼手榴弹、拼刺刀，反复三次将敌杀下去。在这三次肉搏中，何巴虎表现了无比的英勇，他端着机枪向侧翼冲来的敌人猛烈射击，连打六梭子，大量杀伤敌人后，阻止敌人不能冲上来，保证了主力侧翼的安全。可是当他撤退时，敌已冲上来，挡住了去路，他用机枪向敌还击后，跳下沟去，见我们两个伤员的枪没人管，他扛起来就走，敌人又把他的去路堵住了，巴虎扛着两支步枪，一挺机枪绕道而行，这时天已大黑了，因为躲避敌人，在深夜迷失了方向，围着山打起转转来。他想：“我离开部队这是临阵逃脱吧？不！我是把主力掩护下去，被敌人堵住去路而下不去了啊！而且我看到马上就要丢掉的革命武器，要不背起，这不是错误吗？我是支部委员啊！四处情况不明，我到哪里去找部队呢？我宁死也不能当俘虏，这是共产党员的品质”！盘算来盘算去，他决定赶夜突围脱险，向盂城方向去找部队。他上了山头，搞清了方向后，开始走了，但哪知道盂城方向早被敌人占了，把巴虎夹在半山腰了。天不明，机枪大炮响的紧了，他眼看着敌人跑过来转过去，越离他越近。他奇怪的想：“这怎么向外冲呢？这机枪步枪能保守住吗？”最后他下了决心，把机枪和一支步枪掩蔽在山腰里，自己带上一条步枪和敌人拼！他刚把枪掩蔽好，只见敌人被我们包围了，两下里打在一起，他高兴极了，虽然一天一夜还没吃点东西，仍抖擞精神，趁机又杀上山头，打死三个敌人和主力会合了。
    七月十二日清晨，部队从睡梦中醒来，即跑步出发了，由于情况紧急，命令是很简单的：“现在南庄、大常、小常敌人都被我包围起来了，只有西范西南角要我团负责”。部队随即跑步到达指定方向，不料情况发展，西范万余敌人正从此突围出来，前卫部队已捉住了俘虏，打响了。情况是紧张的，团主力尚未来得及展开，敌人三面夹击，冲了过来，三架飞机又来肆扰，前面的部队撤下来，四连的健儿们就在这种紧张的空气中接受了“迅速反冲锋，打退敌人！坚决不能让敌人从这里突围”的艰巨任务。当胡副营长的命令刚下达，敌人的炮弹、子弹、飞机上的机关炮弹集中射击我们的阵地，战士们心里有点不安了。何巴虎同志端起他的机枪就是两梭子，敌人经这一打，扭头就跑，接着四班长潘存山、曹巨才首先冲上去，一、七班也冲上去了，这时何巴虎更是奋不顾身，为保证冲锋部队安全，依然端着机枪和突击部队在一起，打的敌人几次反冲锋未能实现，丢下尸体、彩号、武器狼狈的逃回原据守的大渠上，再不敢逞凶了。这一场恶战，何巴虎的机枪打了七百余发子弹，枪身烧红了，巴虎同志的心也安定了下来，全团转危为安了。西范万余敌人的突围迷梦，挨了当头一棒，再也不想突围了。（张克让，王治国）
