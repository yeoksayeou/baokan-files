　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. American imperialism, in collusion with the Kuomintang's political, military, and business circles, has designated the Yangtze River Power Company, the Jibei Power Plant, the Kailuan Coal Mine, and the Taiwan Sugar Corporation as the first batch of enterprises to be supervised by the United States under the so-called "Industrial Rehabilitation and Parts Program" of American aid. The China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration announced on the 1st that, "in view of the important position of the four enterprises in the Chinese economy, the United States has decided to invest 4.4 million U.S. dollars in these four enterprises as 'American aid investment'," and stipulated that "all American aid investments must be supervised by reliable engineering experts." The bureau has now selected Jardine Engineering Corporation, Andersen, Meyer & Co., Jardine Matheson & Co., and the United States Transport Company to be responsible for the supervision of the aforementioned four enterprises. These companies have the power to dispatch engineers and "propose plans" to each enterprise. According to Steelman, the United States has signed a "contract" with the Kuomintang stipulating that for all Chinese enterprises receiving "American aid," the United States has the right to supervise their property status, the use of funds, the procurement and transportation of materials, the installation of parts, and the business profits; and it publicly stipulates that the application forms of these enterprises to the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration must be treated "as if the management is reporting to the board of directors."
