　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Reuter reports: The British Communist Party issued a statement on the 19th, calling on British workers to resist the Labour government's American-inspired war policies and the attack on living standards. Referring to the government's decision to slow down demobilization and increase arms production, the British Communist Party pointed out: It is precisely for the colonial wars that are already underway and the world war that is being attempted that "a full-scale offensive has been launched against the living standards of British workers, so Cripps is demanding more production and more sacrifices, but at the same time, prices and profits are rising, and the United States is stepping up its control over British industry and trade." "The Labour government's policy is to wholeheartedly and bloodily defend the interests of the monopolists; the working-class movement must challenge it and defeat it." Due to the government's sinful policies, the foundation of full employment has already been undermined, and all these factors are maturing the British economic crisis, unemployment, and economic collapse, just as the United States is entering a crisis. The statement declares that now is the time to enter such an offensive! This offensive is for higher wages, for defending living standards, for cutting profits, and for seeking a policy to resolve the crisis in the interests of the people.

    【新华社陕北二十二日电】电通社报导：英国共产党于十九日发表声明，号召英国工人抵抗工党政府所采取的由美国授意的战争政策而对生活标准的进攻。英共在提及政府减缓复员和增加军备生产的决定时指出：正是为了已经进行的殖民战争和企图进行的世界战争，“所以展开了对英国工人生活标准的全力攻势，所以克利浦斯要求更多的生产和更多的牺牲，但在同时，物价和利润却在上涨，而美国则加紧它对英国工业和贸易的控制。”“工党政府的政策，就是全力和血腥的保卫垄断家的利益，工人阶级运动必须向它挑战并击败它。”由于政府的罪恶政策，充分就业的基础业已被破坏，这一切因素都正使英国经济危机、失业和经济暴跌趋于成熟，亦如美国一样正进入危机。声明宣示，现在已是进入这样一个攻势的时候了！这个攻势是为了更高的工资、为了保卫生活标准、为裁减利润和为了谋求一个按照人民利益解决危机的政策。
