Xinhua News Agency, North China, 27th – Former Northwest Army officers who were liberated and are now studying at the PLA Officer Training Corps in North China, expressed their deep indignation at Hu Zongnan's airlift of the Northwest Army's 30th Division, 27th Brigade, to the isolated city of Taiyuan to die. Xie Xichang, former Deputy Brigade Commander of the 30th Division, 30th Brigade, who was captured in the Linfen Campaign, said, "This is to be a funeral offering for Yan Xishan!" He said, "Hu Zongnan knew very well that Taiyuan was completely isolated and on the verge of collapse, and that reinforcements would never return. Of course, he would send in the miscellaneous troops. This way, he could respond to Yan Xishan without losing his own assets." He said, "The Northwest Army is either assimilated by Chiang and Hu, or sent to their deaths to be destroyed. In 1929, the original Northwest Army still had 34 regiments, not including the directly subordinate brigades of various armies and divisions. Now, only a few remnants remain, such as Liu Ruming, Cao Fulin, and Feng Zhian. The 30th Division now has only three regiments left. The reason why Chiang Kai-shek has not immediately swallowed up these troops is simply to use them to fight to the death against the Communists for him." He was extremely concerned about his many old friends in the 27th Brigade. He said, "They are about to face final destruction. Whether they are killed in battle, captured, or stage an uprising and embark on the road to infinite brightness, at this final juncture, everything depends on themselves."

　　西北军被解放军官谢锡昌谈
  　廿七旅空运太原是给阎锡山陪葬
    【新华社华北二十七日电】在华北解放军官教导团学习的西北军被解放军官，对胡宗南空运西北军系的三十师二十七旅到太原孤城去送死，都表示非常痛愤。前在临汾战役被俘的三十师三十旅副旅长谢锡昌说：“这是给阎锡山当殉葬礼哩！”他说：“胡宗南明知太原已完全陷于孤立绝地，朝不保夕，增援部队有去无回，他当然是派杂牌去。既应付了阎锡山，自己又不蚀本。”他说：“西北军不被蒋、胡化掉，就被送到死路上去打掉。在二十九年，原西北军还有三十四个团，各军师直属旅部尚未计算在内，现在就只剩了刘汝明、曹福林、冯治安等少数残部，三十师现在就只剩了三个团。蒋介石所以还没有立即吃掉这些部队，不过是要利用去替他和共产党拚死。”他对二十七旅的许多老朋友异常关怀。他说：“他们即将遭到最后覆灭了。阵亡，被俘，还是举行起义，走上无限光明的大道，在这最后关头，一切都靠他们自己了。”
