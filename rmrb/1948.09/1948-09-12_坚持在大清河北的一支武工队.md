A Guerrilla Unit Persisting North of the Daqing River

　　A certain district in Baxian County, Jizhong Tenth Military Sub-district, used to be our old base area. Since the enemy began "sweeping" north of the Daqing River in August of last year, the bandit Wang Fenggang has built towers and dug trenches along the Daqing River embankment and the Heping Highway, "searching and suppressing" and "sifting and selecting" day and night. To fight the enemy and defend their homes, the village cadres and militiamen of this area organized a guerrilla unit. In constant combat, they have gradually developed into an organized and disciplined armed work team.

　　The guerrilla unit frequently cooperated with district cadres to penetrate behind enemy lines, conducting high-altitude broadcasts, shouting slogans around towers, and writing slogans to launch extensive political offensives, exposing the rumors and deceptions of bandit Wang and bringing hope to the suffering people. In the tense environment of bandit Wang’s “sweeping” and “suppression,” they continued to break in and out, propagandizing to the masses, educating puppet office personnel, and attacking small groups of enemies who were seizing grain and conscripting soldiers.

　　This spring, the guerrilla unit fought a battle in Gonggang, rescuing more than twenty farmers who had been captured by the enemy. They sheltered the masses during spring plowing in a certain village and helped the landlord with his work. They engaged in public buying and selling in the enemy-occupied areas, without violating regulations. In Niugang, Baxian County, they repelled the enemy who were conscripting soldiers, and the villagers offered them cigarettes, which they declined. During the New Year, they fought a battle in Suqiao, Baxian County, and the masses voluntarily offered them white flour, but they were considerate of the people's suffering and returned the flour intact, earning the enthusiastic praise of the broad masses.

　　During campaigns, the guerrilla unit actively cooperated with the main forces in combat, capturing fleeing enemies. Last September, when our army counterattacked the enemy, the guerrilla unit captured two machine guns and two rifles and took three prisoners in Gonggang (southwest of Baxian). When escorting the prisoners, they observed battlefield discipline and patiently educated the prisoners. When escorting stretchers, they helped the laborers lift and lower them gently, taking care of the wounded by taking their excrement and urine, showing a deep concern for the wounded. They were commended by the logistics command of the military sub-district.

　　On April 2nd, they cooperated with the local armed forces to attack Chaheji (southwest of Baxian). After the battle began, Wang Yantian of the guerrilla unit bravely rushed forward, killing an enemy with a bayonet and then killing a puppet company commander. Chen Zhongyuan and Wu Huichen shouted "Those who lay down their arms will not be killed!" while searching the courtyard. After capturing a prisoner, they immediately educated the prisoner to shout slogans. Chen Zhongyuan also bravely rushed into a house and seized a light machine gun. Niu Tiemai of the Second Squad saw a group of enemies trying to break through and shot down two of them with one shot. In just ten minutes, the battle was over, and all seventy-one enemies were wiped out. In this battle, the guerrilla unit independently captured thirty-five enemies and obtained a light machine gun and seventeen rifles, without any casualties.

　　The activities and tactics of the guerrilla unit were active and proactive, resourceful and brave, acting according to circumstances, and taking action when appropriate, and retreating when not. The enemy forced the masses in each village to signal "Red lights for the arrival of the Eighth Route Army staff, torches for the arrival of the field army." The guerrilla unit used this trick to their advantage, spreading out to light torches everywhere in the villages, scaring the enemy into not daring to come out for four or five days, thus thwarting the enemy's scheme. The cunning enemy would come out secretly during the night and openly during the day. The guerrilla unit grasped the enemy's pattern and secretly ambushed them. In Fengcun, Baxian County, an ambush killed three enemies, wounded one, and obtained two rifles. When the enemy secretly dispersed and hid during the night, the guerrilla unit would gather and launch a sudden search and suppression. The guerrilla unit also proposed "Three Don'ts:" "Don't attack if the target is unclear, don't attack if not accurate, don't attack if you can't win." One night, they encountered the puppet exiled county government of Xin town, wounding four enemies and rescuing fifteen village cadres who had been detained. The guerrilla unit's unpredictable actions completely foiled Wang Bandit’s Seventh Regiment’s (now reorganized into the First Brigade, First Regiment) boast of eliminating the district guerrilla unit. Small groups of enemies no longer dared to move easily at night.

　　Relying on the leadership of the Party and the support of the people, and with the active assistance of the local armed forces, all the members of the guerrilla unit have achieved considerable success through their heroic struggles day and night. From August 20th of last year to April 10th of this year, they fought a total of fifty battles, large and small, destroying twenty-two blockhouses and碉堡, eliminating one hundred and eight enemies below the battalion commander level, and capturing one 82mm mortar, three light machine guns, thirty long and short guns, and some grain, horses, and other military supplies. They have played a significant role in restoring work in the areas they persisted in. They have been commended by a circular from the leaders of the Jizhong Military Region. (Jizhong News)

### 坚持在大清河北的一支武工队

　　坚持在大清河北的一支武工队
    冀中十分区霸县某区，以前是我们的老根据地。从去年八月敌人开始对大清河北“扫荡”后，王匪凤岗沿着大清河堤和平大公路修楼挖沟，日夜“搜剿”“剔抉”。这片村子的村干部和民兵，为了打击敌人保卫家乡，便组织了一个武工队。他们在不断的战斗中，已逐渐锻炼成一支有组织有纪律的武装工作队。
    武工队经常配合区干部伸进敌后，进行高房广播、围楼喊话，写标语等，开展了广泛的政治攻势。揭破了王匪的谣言欺骗。给当地苦难的人民带来了希望。在王匪“扫荡”“清剿”的紧张环境中，他们仍不断突进突出，向群众宣传，教育伪办公人员，打击小股抢粮抓丁的敌人。
    今年春天，武工队在宫岗打了一仗，救下了被敌人抓去的二十多个农民。在某庄掩护群众春耕，帮助房东作活。到了敌占区公买公卖，不违犯制度。在霸县牛岗打退了抓丁的敌人，村里慰问他们烟卷，他们谢绝了。过年的时候，在霸县苏桥打仗，群众自动给他们白面吃，他们体贴群众的苦难，把白面原封送回去，获得广大群众热心赞扬。
    开展战役时，武工队很积极配合主力作战，捕捉溃散的敌人。去年九月，我军向敌反击时，武工队在宫岗（霸县西南）缴了两挺机枪，两支步枪，捉了三个俘虏。押送俘虏时，并遵守战场纪律，还耐心教育俘虏。护送担架时，帮助民工轻抬轻放，接屎接尿，热心爱护伤员。曾得到分区后勤司令部的嘉奖。
    四月二日，配合地方武装打岔河集（霸县西南），战斗开始后，武工队王砚田勇猛冲上去，一刺刀刺死一个敌人，接着打死一个伪中队长。陈仲元、吴会臣一面搜索院里一面喊话：“缴枪不杀！”捉住一个俘虏，他们马上又教育这个俘虏喊话。陈仲元还英勇窜到屋里夺了一挺轻机枪。二中队牛贴劢见一股敌人要突围，一枪打倒了倒两个。只十分钟，战斗就结束了，七十一个敌人全部被歼灭。这一仗，武工队单独活捉了三十五个敌人，得了一挺轻机枪，十七支步枪，武工队没有一个伤亡。
    武工队的活动和战术，积极主动，机智勇敢，看情况办事，采取了该打就打，不打便走。敌人强迫各村群众“八路军工作人员来了点红灯，野战军来了点火把。”武工队就将计就计，伸到各村到处点起火把，吓的敌人四五天不敢出来。这一下就把敌人的诡计破坏了。狡猾的敌人黑价走白日来。武工队抓住敌人的规律，就秘密的伏击。在霸县冯村一伏打死敌人三个，打伤敌人一个，得枪两支。当敌人黑价分散偷着住时，武工队就集合起来猛扑搜剿。武工队并提出“三不打”：“目标不明不打、不准不打、打不过不打。”一天黑价碰上新镇伪流亡县政府，打伤了四个敌人，救下了被扣的村干部十五人。武工队神出鬼没，使王匪七团（现改为一旅一团）消灭区武工队的牛皮完全失败了。小股敌人黑价已不敢轻易活动。
    武工队靠着党的领导和人民的支援，靠着地方武装的积极帮助，全体队员们日日夜夜的英勇斗争，得到了不少成绩。从去年八月二十日到今年四月十日，共大小战斗五十次。摧毁点碉二十二座，歼敌营长以下一百零八名，缴八二迫击炮一门、轻机枪三挺、长短枪三十支、粮食、马匹和别的军用品一部。在坚持地区恢复工作上起了很大作用。曾得到冀中军区首长的通令嘉奖。（冀中讯）
