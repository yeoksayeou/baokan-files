　　▲ In August, Japanese food prices rose sharply by 51% compared to January-July, and clothing prices increased by 12%.
　　▲ As of the end of August, Japan had issued a total of 250.6 billion yen in currency. On August 28th alone, 755 million yen in banknotes were issued.
　　▲ In June, Japan's industrial production was 52.7% of the 1930-1934 average; in July, it was 55%. (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th)
