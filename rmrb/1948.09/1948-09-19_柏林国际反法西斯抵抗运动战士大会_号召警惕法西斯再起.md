Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS reports: On September 11, the day before the International Memorial Day for those who died under fascist rule, the International Conference of Anti-Fascist Resistance Fighters was held in Berlin. The conference was convened by the Presidium of the International Federation of Former Political Prisoners and was attended by representatives from the Soviet Union, France, Switzerland, Norway, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Yugoslavia, Poland, and fighting Greece and democratic Spain. Many representatives from the four occupied zones of Germany and Berlin also attended. Colonel Dupanov, representative of the Soviet Military Administration, paid tribute to the conference; he pointed out that the reactionary camp is intensely preparing for a new world war, and he called on German anti-fascists to pay attention to the new fascism in West Germany. Hans Siegiwasser, member of the Central Bureau of the League of Forced Victims under Nazi Rule and former chairman of the Political Prisoner Committee of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, discussed the current tasks of German anti-fascists, pointing out that the democratization of public life in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany was only possible because the material pillars of fascist forces were deprived immediately after the defeat of German fascism.

Siegiwasser also pointed out: Currently, a military alliance of "Steel Helmet" members has been established in West Germany, and former Nazi SS members are now developing their activities under the guise of the "Steel Helmet." The French representative said: "We cannot tolerate the resurgence of fascist forces in power." Lorenzo, the representative of Democratic Spain, assured the conference that the Spanish people would fight against Franco's terrorist regime until complete victory was achieved. The representative of Fighting Greece conveyed the respect of the Greek people to the conference and called on the democratic forces of all countries to support the Greek people in their struggle against imperialism and fascism. Representatives from Denmark, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia also delivered speeches at the conference.

　　柏林国际反法西斯抵抗运动战士大会
  　号召警惕法西斯再起
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社报导：九月十一日，即法西斯主义统治下殉难者国际纪念日的前一日，柏林举行了国际反法西斯抵抗运动战士大会。该会由国际前政治犯联盟主席团召集，有苏、法、瑞（士）、挪、奥、捷、丹、南、波诸国及战斗希腊与民主西班牙的代表参加。德境四占领区及柏林也有代表多人参加。苏联军政府代表杜潘诺夫上校向大会致敬；他指出反动阵营正紧张地准备新的世界大战，他号召德国反法西斯主义者注意西德的新法西斯主义。纳粹统治下被迫害者联盟中央局委员，前萨克逊豪森集中营政治犯委员会主席汉斯·西吉瓦瑟论述德国反法西斯主义者的当前任务，指出德境苏占区公共生活的民主化之所以可能，只是因为在击败德国法西斯之后立即剥夺了法西斯力量的物质支柱。
    西吉瓦瑟并指出：目前又有一种“钢盔团”的军人联盟在西德建立起来，以前的纳粹党卫队队员今日又在“钢盔”的掩盖下发展他们的活动。法国代表称：“我们不能容忍法西斯力量再度当政。”民主西班牙代表罗伦佐向会议保证西班牙人民将对佛朗哥恐怖制度作战，直到获得完全胜利。战斗希腊代表向大会传达希腊人民的敬意，并呼吁一切国家的民主力量支持在对帝国主义、对法西斯主义斗争中的希腊人民。丹、南、捷代表也在大会上发表了演说。
