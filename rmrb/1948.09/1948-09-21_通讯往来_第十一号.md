Correspondence

No. 11
To Comrades of Offices and Correspondents of Various Special Counties in Taihang:

After the District Party Committee's joint meeting of county committees in August, each county has been working intensely to prepare and arrange for the conclusion of land reform, Party rectification, establishment of political power, and the development of production. How are your county's specific plans and steps for this autumn and winter and next spring arranged? How is the work of training a large number of cadres before autumn progressing? What are the common ideological problems among the cadres, and how are they being resolved? How did you begin the work? How many villages have been identified to complete land reform before autumn? What is the current progress? What problems have been discovered in the process of concluding land reform? What experiences and lessons have been learned? What are the specific reactions of the masses to the conclusion of land reform? How is the stability of the masses' production morale manifested? How are the villages that will not complete land reform before autumn integrated with the autumn harvest, wheat planting, and autumn plowing? What is the current situation of autumn harvest and wheat planting in each county? What experiences have been gained in the general rectification of cooperatives (in addition to comprehensive reports, you can choose one or two typical cases to report)? At the same time, in the course of work, what situations and problems have been investigated and understood regarding past land reform and Party rectification? We hope you will write about these promptly and continuously.
