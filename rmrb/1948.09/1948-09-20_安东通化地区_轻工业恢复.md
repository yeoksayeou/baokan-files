　　Andong-Tonghua Area
  　Light Industry Recovery
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th] Various light industries producing daily necessities in the Andong Province's Tonghua area, which had been devastated twice by the enemy, have now rapidly recovered. These include the match, wine, soap, leather, textile, pine root oil, paper making, glass, ironwork, dyeing, printing, and clothing industries. The recovery and development of the match industry is particularly remarkable. One small match factory in the area, which had been shut down for over a year, has been reorganized and rebuilt. In the past, each clamp-lever machine produced less than ten boxes per day, but now it can produce over 21 boxes at its peak. The Lion brand matches produced now contain 80 to 90 or even 100 matchsticks per small box, compared to 70 in the past, and are guaranteed to be durable and ignite every time. Furthermore, the chemical raw materials used have been reduced by over 16% compared to the past. Tonghua wine is a famous specialty of Northeast China, and it has maintained its excellent quality after resuming production. The manufacturing of pine root oil had no achievements under the puppet Manchukuo regime. However, after nearly a year of efforts by the democratic government, preliminary success has been achieved. The crude oil (raw “Mingzi” oil after the first distillation) and refined oil (raw oil after the second distillation) can generally be used as substitutes for gasoline in automobiles. The refined oil, in particular, has a high explosive power and a flash point of 45 degrees Celsius, making it especially convenient to use in the summer. It is generally believed that the gas power is even greater than that of gasoline. The oil yield of "Mingzi" is 5%, and the total cost is less than half the selling price of gasoline. There are also by-products such as lubricating oil (which can be used as mechanical lubricating oil), wood vinegar, wood alcohol, and black oil, which have significant uses in industry and medicine. In addition, there are many new types of industries emerging in the area, such as using soybean oil to make hard soap, using various animal fats or soybean oil to make fine scented soap, using machinery to manufacture various chemical leathers (such as textured leather and suede), and manufacturing cutting, weaving, pressing, and root-pulling machines and glassware for agricultural and industrial use. Although the scale is not large and the technology is still preliminary, it has made a significant contribution to the local people. Its development prospects are immeasurable.

　　安东通化地区
  　轻工业恢复
    【新华社东北十六日电】曾遭敌两次摧残之安东省通化地区各种日用必需品轻工业，现已迅速恢复，包括火柴、葡萄酒、肥皂、皮革、纺织、松根油、造纸、玻璃、铁工、漂染、印刷和被服等业，其中火柴工业之恢复发展尤为显著。该地停工一年多的一家小火柴厂，经整顿重建后，过去每架夹杆机日产不足十箱，现在最高能产廿一箱以上；所产狮子牌火柴每小盒已由过去之七十根增到八九十根甚至一百根，且保证经久不坏，根根发火；所用化学原料则较过去节省百分之十六以上。通化葡萄酒是东北著名特产之一，复工后，仍保持了优良品质。松根油之制造，伪满时并无任何成就，经民主政府近一年来之努力，已获初步成功。所制粗油（“明子”原油经第一次蒸溜）、精油（原油第二次蒸溜）一般可作汽车汽油的代用品，特别是精油，爆发性很大，引火点是摄氏四十五度，夏季使用尤为方便；一般认为瓦斯力量且较汽油为大。“明子”出油率为百分之五，全部成本不及汽油卖价一半，并有副产物润滑油（可作机械润滑油使用）、木醋酸、木精、黑油等，在工业及医药上用途甚大。此外该地尚有出现不少新型工业，如以豆油制造硬性肥皂，用各种动物脂肪或豆油制造精细香皂，用机械制造各种化学皮革（如纹皮、翻毛皮等），以及制造农工用的切草、织布、压力、拔根等机器及玻璃器具等。现虽规模不大，技术亦属初步，但对当地人民贡献很大。其发展前途不可限量。
