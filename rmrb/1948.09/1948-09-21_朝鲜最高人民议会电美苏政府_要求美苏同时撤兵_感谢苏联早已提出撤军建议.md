　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th] TASS, Pyongyang dispatch: The Korean Supreme People's Assembly cabled the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union on the 10th, requesting the simultaneous withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops from Korea. The cable first pointed out that for three years, the Korean people's desire to rapidly restore national independence and establish an independent democratic state has not been realized. U.S. and Soviet troops still continue to be stationed in Korea, and therefore Korea is divided into two parts. In the north and south of Korea, completely opposite social, economic, and political systems have been established. This division seriously hinders the regeneration of Korea's economy, politics, and culture. The cable pointed out that this division, in addition to causing huge economic damage to the Korean people, also facilitates pro-Japanese elements and various reactionaries to incite hostility between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, as well as animosity between the North and South Korean people. This is a dangerous factor for world peace. The cable declared that there is no legitimate reason for foreign troops to continue to be stationed in Korea, because it has been three years since Japan surrendered and the Japanese army in Korea was disarmed. The decisions of the Moscow Conference on the Korean issue have in effect been obstructed. Therefore, the Korean people demand that all foreign troops immediately withdraw from Korea and allow the Korean people to decide their own destiny without foreign interference. The cable reiterated that the Korean people have consistently refused to recognize the illegal elections held in South Korea and the "National Assembly" and "government" established after the elections, and declared that the North-South Korean elections held in August were elections that truly reflected the free will of the people. The Korean Supreme People's Assembly, produced by this election, is the only legitimate supreme legislative power organ in Korea that truly represents the entire nation. The cable solemnly declared: "The Korean Supreme People's Assembly hereby expresses the wishes and unyielding will of the entire Korean people, requesting the United States Government and the Soviet Government to immediately and simultaneously withdraw their troops from Korea." The cable concluded: "The Korean Supreme People's Assembly, on behalf of the entire Korean people, conveys its gratitude to the great Soviet Government for its suggestion as early as September 26, 1947, that the U.S. and Soviet troops should simultaneously withdraw from Korea, and for repeatedly reiterating thereafter that as long as the U.S. government also withdraws its troops from Korea at the same time, the Soviet Union is willing to immediately withdraw its troops from Korea."

　　朝鲜最高人民议会电美苏政府
  　要求美苏同时撤兵
    感谢苏联早已提出撤军建议
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜最高人民议会于十日致电美苏两国政府，请求将美苏军队同时撤离朝鲜。电文首先指出：三年以来朝鲜人民的迅速恢复民族独立与建立独立民主国的愿望迄未实现。美苏军队现仍继续驻留朝鲜，因此朝鲜被分为两部分，在朝鲜的北部和南部，已建立了完全相反的社会情况、经济情况与政治制度。这种划分严重地阻碍着朝鲜经济、政治、文化各方面的再生。电文指出：这种分割除使朝鲜人民蒙受巨大的经济损害以外，还便于亲日分子及各种反动分子煽动美苏两国的敌意以及南北朝鲜人民间的敌对情绪，这是对世界和平的危险因素。电文宣称，外国军队继续驻留朝鲜已无任何正当理由，因为自日本投降与朝鲜日军被解除武装以来，迄今已达三年。而莫斯科会议关于朝鲜问题的决定，实际上已遭受阻挠。故朝鲜人民要求一切外国军队立即撤离朝鲜和使朝鲜人民得以自行决定其命运而不受外国干涉。电文重申朝鲜人民始终不承认南朝鲜所举行的非法选举和选举后成立的“国民议会”与“政府”，并宣称：八月间所举行的南北朝鲜选举是真正反映人民自由意志的选举，而由这次选举所产生的朝鲜最高人民议会，是真正全国的惟一合法的朝鲜最高立法权力机关。电文至此郑重宣告：“朝鲜最高人民议会兹表示全体朝鲜人民愿望与不屈的意志，请求美国政府与苏联政府立即同时将其军队撤离朝鲜”。电文最后称：“朝鲜最高人民议会代表全体朝鲜人民向伟大的苏联政府转达谢意，感谢它远在一九四七年九月二十六日即已建议美、苏军队同时撤离朝鲜，并于其后一再重申，只要美国政府也将其军队同时撤离朝鲜，苏联愿意立即将其军队撤离朝鲜。”
