　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. According to reports from TASS and Telepress: The working people of Berlin, opposing the reactionary Berlin City Council and City Government, which are controlled by reactionaries, for implementing reactionary American and British policies and causing economic chaos in Berlin, held a powerful demonstration on August 26th and 27th, with 250,000 people participating. During the demonstration on the 26th, 50,000 workers gathered in front of the Berlin City Hall (the City Council is also located inside the City Hall), holding signs and shouting "We demand a unified autonomous government, a unified currency, and unified supplies," "We demand the resignation of the City Council," and "The corrupt City Government must step down immediately." The demonstrators also demanded that preparations for winter be started. When the City Council evaded their demands, the demonstrators orderly occupied the City Hall, held a meeting, and demanded the formation of an emergency committee composed of nine city councilors and nine Berlin citizens each, to prepare to take over the functions of the City Government. Ritterke, the chairman of the Unified Socialist Party faction of the City Council, addressed the demonstrators, agreeing to their various democratic demands. Reactionary leaders of the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and others held a "counter-demonstration," gathering staff members of various reactionary parties, black market operators, and vagrant street children in the square, but they numbered only about five thousand, and when they delivered platitudes to these "counter-demonstrators," the audience dispersed.

　　反对美英走狗市议会市政府
  　柏林劳动人民大示威
  　要求统一的自治政府统一的货币
    【新华社陕北一日电】据塔斯社、电通社报导：柏林劳动人民为反对反动派把持的柏林市议会和市政府奉行美英反动政策并造成柏林经济情况混乱，于八月二十六、二十七两日举行有二十五万人参加的强大示威。二十六日示威进行时，五万劳动人民齐集柏林市政府门前（市议会亦设在市政府内），手持标语牌，高呼“我们要求统一的自治政府，统一的货币，统一的供给”、“我们要求市议会辞职”、“腐化的市政府立即下台”。示威者并要求着手准备过冬计划。当市议会对他们的要求规避不理后，示威群众即井然有序地占据市政厅，举行会议，要求组成一个包括市议员和柏林公民各九人之紧急委员会，准备接收市政府职权。市议会之统一社会党党团主席李特克对示威群众发表演讲，同意他们的各项民主要求。社会民主党、基督教民主党等反动领袖曾举行“反示威”，他们把各反动政党的工作人员、黑市活动者和流浪的野孩子纠集在广场上，但为数只有五千人上下，而且当他们对这些“反示威”者大发谚语时，听众便纷纷走散了。
