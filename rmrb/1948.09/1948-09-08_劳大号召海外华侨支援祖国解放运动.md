Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 5th. The Labor Congress unanimously passed a telegram to overseas Chinese on August 16, expressing deep sympathy for the persecution suffered by overseas Chinese under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and expressing deep concern for their patriotic movement and struggle to protect their vital interests. It called on them to join the people of the country in fighting to overthrow the rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary group, in China. The original telegram is as follows:

To all overseas news agencies, overseas Chinese organizations, and all compatriots overseas:

Our Sixth National Labor Congress of China has victoriously opened in Harbin, a city of the people. We have excitedly united the strength of the working class throughout the country, reviewed our experiences in the struggle in the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and formulated future tasks to prepare for the upcoming victory of the national people's liberation cause. At the same time, we are thinking of our worker compatriots and all overseas compatriots with the utmost concern.

The patriotism and contributions of overseas Chinese to the motherland are well known to the people of the whole country. Whether it was during the Xinhai Revolution, the Great Revolution, or the War of Resistance Against Japan, the overseas Chinese were enthusiastic supporters. During the War of Resistance, the surging patriotic salvation movement and donation movement by overseas Chinese in various places, especially overseas Chinese workers, and even the people's armed forces returning to China to participate in the War of Resistance; during the period when the Japanese invaders invaded Southeast Asia, many overseas Chinese directly participated in the local anti-Japanese struggle. That is to say, in the anti-Japanese war in China and Southeast Asia, our overseas compatriots have gloriously fulfilled their responsibility.

Like the people at home, overseas compatriots also yearn for a new China that is independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous. However, all domestic and foreign policies of the Kuomintang reactionary rule completely violate the wishes of the people of the whole country and overseas compatriots. For the benefit of the four major families, bureaucratic capitalists, large warlords, big landlords, and even big traitors, for the sake of national betrayal, dictatorship, and counter-revolutionary civil war, they are implementing the Qing Dynasty's policy of "preferring to give to friendly countries rather than domestic slaves," kowtowing to American imperialism for money, and offering the sovereignty of China's sea, land, and air, inland river navigation rights, customs rights, development rights, and all kinds of sovereignty to American imperialism with both hands. They hired Japanese war criminals as senior consultants, and even used Japanese fascist armed forces to attack the Chinese people; before the Japanese peace conference was held and the peace treaty was signed, they flattered the will of American imperialism, sang praises of leniency towards Japan, and condoned the revival of Japanese imperialism. For the sake of the pockets of bureaucratic capitalists, they have already condoned the dumping of American goods in China, and now they are condoning the dumping of Japanese goods in China, causing unprecedented blows to Chinese national capital, massive unemployment of workers, hunger and bankruptcy of the broad masses of people, the flight of large numbers of compatriots overseas to seek a living, and the economic destruction of overseas Chinese businesses in various places, making it impossible for overseas Chinese businessmen to operate and overseas Chinese workers to find employment. In a word, the Kuomintang reactionary rule wants to turn China into a colony of American imperialists, plunging the people of the whole country and overseas compatriots into the abyss of slavery.

The crimes directly committed by the Kuomintang reactionary rule against overseas compatriots in various places overseas are even more well-known to you. They collude with imperialism and local reactionary rule to suppress your patriotic democratic movement and legal activities to protect your vital interests, close your schools and newspapers, arrest people or deport them. They even use various conspiracies to provoke unity within overseas Chinese and between overseas Chinese and local ethnic groups, and even achieve their goals by means of secret agents. All these facts show that as long as the rule of American imperialists and their running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary group, in China is not eliminated, the suffering of the broad masses of overseas compatriots cannot be alleviated.

Compatriots, we deeply sympathize with your current situation, and we are equally deeply concerned about your patriotic movement and struggle to protect your vital interests. Now, thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party, the strength of the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army has become unprecedentedly strong. The rule of the American imperialists and their running dog, the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary group, in China is increasingly heading towards extinction. No matter how much American imperialism helps, it cannot save the fate of its running dogs. The day of complete liberation for the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country is not far away, and the arrival of this day will also bring light to overseas compatriots. We sincerely believe that you will definitely be able to unite better in the future, and the overseas Chinese and the local ethnic groups will also unite better, so that Kuomintang secret agents will have no way to use their divisive tricks, strengthen the movement to fight for democracy and freedom and support the liberation of the motherland, and cooperate with the people at home to strive for the early realization of complete victory.

At present, the workers and people from all walks of life in the liberated areas are stepping up production with the highest enthusiasm, prospering the economy, and striving to support the People's Liberation War. At the same time, they sincerely welcome overseas workers and business people to come to the liberated areas to participate in industrial construction, and to work together with the people in the liberated areas to strive for the establishment of a new China that is independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous.

　　劳大号召海外华侨支援祖国解放运动
    【新华社东北五日电】劳动大会于八月十六日一致通过致电海外华侨，对华侨在海外所遭受的国民党反动统治的迫害，表示深切的同情，对他们的爱国运动和保护切身利益的斗争，表示深切关怀，号召他们与国内人民一起为推翻美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动集团在中国的统治而奋斗。原电如下：
    海外各通讯社，各华侨团体，转各地全体侨胞公鉴：
    我们中国第六次的劳动大会，胜利地在人民自己的城市哈尔滨开幕了。我们兴奋地团结了全国工人阶级的力量，检讨了我们在解放区和国民党统治区奋斗的经验，并规定了今后任务，准备迎接即将到来的全国人民解放事业的胜利。同时我们以最关切的心情，惦念着我各地华侨工友和全体侨胞。
    华侨的爱国热忱和对祖国的贡献，是全国人民所熟知的。无论是辛亥革命时期，大革命时期，抗日时期，侨胞们都是热心的支持者。在抗战时期，各地侨胞特别是侨工，奔腾澎湃的救亡运动，捐献运动，甚至回国参加抗日的人民武装；在日寇侵入东南亚的时期，许多侨胞直接参加了当地的抗日斗争。这就是说，在中国和东南亚的抗日战争中，我海外侨胞光荣地尽了自己的一份责任。
    侨胞们也同国内人民一样，渴望一个独立、自由、民主、统一与富强的新中国。然而国民党反动统治的一切内政外交措施，却完全违背了全国人民和侨胞的愿望。他们为了四大家族、官僚资本家以及大军阀、大地主甚至大汉奸的利益，为了卖国独裁和反革命内战，竟执行着满清的“宁赠友邦勿予家奴”的政策，向美国帝国主义叩头借钱，把中国海、陆、空的主权，内河航行权，关税权，开发权，各种各样的主权都双手奉送给美帝国主义。他们把日本战犯聘为高级顾问，以至使用日本法西斯武装来进攻中国人民；在对日和会还未开，和约未订的时候，他们就奉承美帝国主义意旨，高唱对日宽大，纵容日本帝国主义的复活。为了官僚资本家的腰包，他们既已纵容了美帝货物在中国的倾销，现在又纵容了日货在中国倾销，使中国民族资本遭受空前打击，工人大量失业，使广大人民饥饿破产，使大量同胞逃亡海外求生，使各地侨胞在国内经营之经济大遭破坏，使侨商无业可营，侨工无业可就。总之一句话，国民党反动统治要把中国变为美帝国主义者的殖民地，使全国人民与各地侨胞更加陷入奴隶生活的深渊里。
    国民党反动统治在海外各地所直接加于侨胞的罪行，更是你们所亲受熟知的。他们勾结帝国主义和当地反动统治，压迫你们的爱国民主运动和保护切身利益的合法活动，封闭你们的学校和报纸，逮捕人员或驱逐出境，他们更使用各种阴谋以挑拨侨胞内部及侨胞同当地民族间的团结，甚至以特务手段达到他们的目的。所有这些事实说明，美帝国主义者及其走狗国民党反动集团在中国的统治一天不消灭，广大侨胞的痛苦是无法解除的。
    侨胞们，我们深切地同情你们的当前处境，我们同样深切地关心你们的爱国运动与保护自己切身利益的斗争。现在由于共产党的领导，中国人民和解放军的力量，已经空前地强大起来，美国帝国主义者及其走狗的国民党反革命集团在中国的统治则日益走向灭亡，不管美帝国主义怎样帮助，也无法挽救其走狗的覆没的命运。中国工人阶级和全国人民全面解放的日子已经不远了，而这个日子的到来，同时也就带来了侨胞们的光明。我们衷心地相信你们今后一定能够团结得更好，侨胞与当地民族之间也团结得更好，使国民党特务无从施展其挑拨离间的技俩，加强争民主、争自由的与支援祖国解放的运动，配合国内人民争取全面胜利的早日实现。
    目前解放区工友和各界人士正以最高的热忱加紧生产，繁荣经济，努力支援人民解放战争，同时衷心地欢迎海外工友及工商界人士到解放区来参加工业建设，与解放区人民一起，为建立独立、自由、民主、统一与富强的新中国而奋斗。
