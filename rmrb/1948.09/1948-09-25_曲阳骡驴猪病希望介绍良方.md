[North China News] In Quyang's first, fourth, and sixth districts, mules, donkeys, and pigs are suffering from plagues. According to statistics from eight villages including Dongheliu, thirty-six mules, horses, and donkeys have died in half a month. Pig plague is also very serious in the third, fourth, and sixth districts. In Zhujiayu in the sixth district, there are 300 pigs, and more than 100 are now sick. In Xiguo Village in the fourth district, more than 60 have died, and in Nanguzhang, four have died. The county leadership has now issued two notices to all districts, in addition to organizing local veterinarians to actively treat the animals, the main task is to organize and lead the masses to take early preventive measures. There is still no good method to treat this plague, especially the "limp jaundice" disease affecting livestock, which is impossible to cure. It is hoped that various regions will introduce good remedies to benefit production. (Jiang Fu, Feng Yi)
