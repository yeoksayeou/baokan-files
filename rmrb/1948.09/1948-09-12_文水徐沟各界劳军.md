[Jinzhong Electric] The masses in the new district warmly comforted the People's Liberation Army. Representatives from all circles in Wen Shui formed a comfort group and propaganda team, bringing 22 pigs, 142 sheep, 57 chickens, 18 banners, 58 letters of appreciation, and a large quantity of cigarettes, eggs, and watermelons to the front lines to comfort the People's Liberation Army. Meng Yun's wife, a poor peasant from Old City Village, used the money she earned from selling melons to buy 60 eggs and personally participated in the comfort group to comfort the wounded. Ma Wuzhen, a poor woman, sewed six undershirts overnight to comfort the troops. A midwife from Yiren Village took out a large handkerchief and insisted on giving it to the People's Liberation Army, saying, "When the Yan bandits were here, people were not allowed to move around after dark. No one dared to call me when a family had a baby at night. Now that we are liberated, it's okay to call me anytime." On August 16th, the people of Xu Gou also rushed pigs, sheep, cigarettes, vegetables, watermelons, and other items to a celebration meeting in a certain place to comfort the People's Liberation Army. The comfort banners were inscribed with bold characters such as "Lifesaving Benefactors," "The People's Army is Invincible," and "Heroic and Meritorious in Killing the Enemy." Businesses and school students in Jiaocheng Chengguan jointly wrote letters to comfort the front-line troops. (Li Muzhi, Dahai)
