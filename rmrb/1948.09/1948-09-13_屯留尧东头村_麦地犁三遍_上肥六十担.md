【Taiyue Electric】 Tunliu Yaodongtou Village has begun planting wheat. Since the rectification of policies, the enthusiasm for production among all classes in the village has been high. After weeding the autumn seedlings, all ten mutual aid groups in the village (thirty-four male full and semi-laborers, twenty-six head of livestock) actively accumulated land and fertilizer. By September 2nd, over 270 mu of the village's 370 mu of wheat fields had been plowed three times, and the rest had been plowed twice. Shen Changju's twelve mu of wheat fields were even plowed four times, with an average application of 65 to 70 loads of dry manure per mu, or 16 to 17 loads of thatched manure. Middle peasant Shen Qichang, who had been mistakenly criticized, applied two layers of fertilizer to his wheat fields, with 35 loads of dry manure and 16 to 17 loads of thatched manure per mu. Even the resettled rich peasants Wang Puming and Shen Yimao planned to plant eight mu of wheat. Village Chief Wang Hei Han and Production Director Wang Junmeng also helped them borrow wheat seeds. According to Village Chief Wang, "This year's production enthusiasm is very high, greatly exceeding previous years. Last year, wheat fields were plowed at most twice, and most were planted after being plowed only once. This year, they are plowed one more time. Last year, each mu of wheat land received about ten loads of thatched manure, some only received two soybean cakes, and some didn't receive any fertilizer at all. This year, an average of 65 to 70 loads of fertilizer are applied per mu, exceeding last year's amount by six to seven times." Sowing has already begun, and it is expected that all will be planted within ten days.

　　屯留尧东头村
  　麦地犁三遍
  　上肥六十担
    【太岳电】屯留尧东头村开始种麦。该村自端正政策以后，各阶层生产情绪高涨，锄完秋苗全村十个互助组（男全半劳力三十四人，牲口二十六头。）就积极积地积肥，九月二日全村三百七十亩麦地已有二百七十多亩犁过三遍，其余都犁过两遍。申常居的十二亩麦地还犁了四遍，每亩平均上干粪六十五担到七十担，或灌茅粪十六七担，误斗过的中农申起昌等麦地都上了两层粪，每亩上干粪三十五担外，还灌茅粪十六七担。就是安置了的富农王普明、申益茂两家也计划种麦八亩。村长王黑汉和生产主任王俊梦，还帮助他们借下麦籽。据王村长说：“今年生产情绪很高，大大超过往年。去年麦地最多犁两遍，大部分是犁一遍就种了，今年多犁一遍；去年种麦每亩上茅粪十来担，有的只上两个豆饼，甚至有根本不上粪的；今年平均每亩上粪六十五担到七十担，超过去年六七倍。”现已开始下种，预计十天内就能全部种上。
