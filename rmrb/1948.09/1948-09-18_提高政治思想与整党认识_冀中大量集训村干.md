Jizhong News: In order to enable village-level cadres and party members to correctly accept the instructions of the Central Committee and the North China Bureau regarding the tasks for 1948, and to thoroughly correct deviations and rectify policies, the Jizhong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided in July to massively train village cadres and party members. This training aims to prepare them ideologically and organizationally for completing the Party rectification and governance construction, ending land reform, and transitioning to production work in the autumn. Training classes were opened in various counties during the agricultural slack season in July and August. Some counties have already concluded the first phase, and the second phase has begun. The first phase of training for cadres in Shen, Zhao, Gao (cheng), and Su (ning) counties, as well as the village cadre team of the District Committee Party School, involved a total of 1,928 trainees, with training periods ranging from one to twenty days. The main experience was to initially allow trainees to express their opinions freely, with the leadership conducting self-criticism of their work, and then mobilizing the trainees to conduct serious criticism and self-criticism, ultimately resolving pressing ideological and work-style issues. When this approach was adopted, the results were good; otherwise, the achievements were small. The experience of the training classes in the district in resolving cadres' ideological problems is presented below for reference.

　　　　Mobilizing Trainees Must Be Prudent; Indiscriminate Sending and Receiving Makes It Difficult to Succeed

First, mobilizing trainees must be prudent and responsible, with strict requirements. The Eighth District Committee of Jizhong stipulated that the trainees should generally be the village branch secretaries, organization, publicity, and deputy chairmen of peasant representative conferences, and production, security, and militia committee members. Those who had served as puppet soldiers or in puppet offices, degenerated cadres, those with unclear political backgrounds, "lackeys," or idlers, and those who were substitutes should not be included. Because the aim was to train a group of key figures in the shortest possible time to enable them to undertake the arduous tasks of Party rectification in rural areas and ending land reform, if there were indiscriminate sending and receiving, it would be difficult for such a short-term training class to succeed. The lessons from Zhao County and Gaocheng County were painful. Among the trainees sent by various districts and villages in these counties were old men in their seventies, sons in their sixties, pregnant women about to give birth, seventeen-year-old children, those who had defected to the enemy and been expelled from the Party but whom the district committee had re-introduced as formal party members, those bringing one or two children and suffering from malaria, and those who were impersonating relatives as substitutes. Of the 488 people sent by Zhao County, 131 were returned due to being unqualified, and ten fled. The reason was a lack of understanding of the significance of this training for village cadres, and fear that village work would suffer after training. Therefore, they mostly sent secondary cadres, and even resorted to deception and coercion to make up the numbers. Some deceived by saying, "Go to a meeting for seven or eight days and come back." Some threatened, "You are a party member and must obey the organization's arrangements; if you don't go, we'll tie you up and take you." Some trainees wasted public funds and brought money casually. Zhao County estimated that more than 80% of all trainees used public funds, and two trainees from Xihe Village in the 11th District brought 30,000 yuan. After reviewing the above shortcomings, the Zhao and Gaocheng County Committees again instructed the districts and villages to oppose this liberal attitude and strictly stipulate the qualifications of trainees to ensure the completion of the next phase of the study plan.

At the beginning of the term, the leadership clearly announced that all opinions could be expressed regarding the Party rectification, clarifying right and wrong and responsibility, with higher authorities taking responsibility for the mistakes of higher authorities. Because most trainees were dissatisfied with the Party rectification, believing that the Party rectification was "a mess," and that veteran cadres had been taken down. The burden of "merit" was very heavy, and they felt that after driving away the Japanese, Chiang Kai-shek drove away half of the country again. They thought that after they had won the country, they were now being turned against. Therefore, some thought, "Even if we study, we won't work when we go back." Some cursed the work teams, and some felt wronged. Among the 682 trainees in Shen County, veteran cadres accounted for the vast majority, including 44 who had been detained, 129 who were dissatisfied with land reform and Party rectification due to incorrect suspensions of party membership or some land being touched, and 278 veteran cadres who were also shouting "a mess" due to being affected by confused thinking. These accounted for 66% of all trainees. There were 231 people who supported land reform and Party rectification and worked actively in the villages, most of whom were new cadres, accounting for only 34% of the trainees. Therefore, at the beginning of the term, many people came with the attitude of "complaining" and "seeking redress," and some even had thoughts of revenge. At this time, the leadership must treat them warmly, guide and enlighten them, and let them say what they wanted to say as much as possible, without fearing complaints or rushing to criticize them. The leadership should conduct sincere and appropriate self-criticism based on the facts presented by everyone and certain errors in the Party rectification. At the opening ceremony, the Shen County Committee made appropriate self-criticism of the deviations or errors in the Party rectification and called on everyone to humbly examine themselves, adhere to the truth, and correct their mistakes. After these efforts, the trainees gradually calmed down and gradually turned to examining themselves.

　　　　The Leadership Conducts Sincere Self-Criticism; Trainees' Criticism and Self-Criticism

At this time, it is necessary to rely closely on the emerging activists and better elements to take the lead in self-examination and carry out criticism and self-criticism. The Party School's village cadre team, in connection with the content of each lesson in the party member textbook, reflected on themselves. Initially, some people thought that the rural party should be rectified, but they themselves should not be rectified. When they learned how to be a good Communist Party member and used the six standards of a party member to measure themselves, everyone felt that they had shortcomings and that they should also be rectified. Shen County came up with several topics: (1) Why implement land reform and Party rectification? (2) What deviations occurred in your village during land reform and Party rectification? (3) Are the achievements of land reform and Party rectification greater or the errors greater? (4) What problems exist in your village now, and how should they be resolved? The ideological struggle was very sharp in the discussion. At this time, the main ideological situations were: agreeing that good people should rectify the party, opposing bad people rectifying the party; in villages where Party rectification had deviations, those leading the Party rectification should be blamed. Many veteran cadres regarded themselves as "heroes," complaining and seeking redress, and not examining themselves; some were discouraged and did not work, fearing further Party rectification. In the discussion, activists and better elements were discovered and cultivated, and they were encouraged to give typical reports. These included: 1. The Xili Village branch, which was usurped by the Kuomintang district branch organization member Yuan Xicai, who was a rich peasant, and the rich peasant Hao Shunhua. Upright party members were suppressed, and the mass struggle was obstructed. 2. The Nanhe Le Temple branch, controlled by the hooligan Zhang Huanzhang, embezzled public funds, used coercion, and messed around with women. 3. Liu Zhensheng of Liren Village had personal opinions about Yan Mingzhi, a cadre from a poor peasant background and a demobilized soldier, and Yan deliberately detained him. His parents and wife became ill and died, but he still worked actively, without retaliation or pessimism. 4. Wang Wanjin, a party member and cadre from Xiaolv Village. 5. Guo Zhenqian from West Guanjie, all talked about the ideological transformation from pessimism to active work after being detained. These five typical materials were all reported by the parties involved. After the first two branch materials were reported, the trainees realized the importance of Party rectification and also conducted self-examination in connection with the situation in their own villages. The reports of the latter three typical people had a very profound educational significance for some veteran cadres with pessimistic, negative, and retaliatory emotions. In particular, Liu Zhensheng's report deeply moved everyone. Then, in conjunction with the trainees' ideological situation, a brief summary of the county's land reform and Party rectification was reported, and then Party rectification education was implemented, so that the trainees had a further correct understanding of the past and future Party rectification ideologically, and further deeply examined themselves, carried out criticism and self-criticism, affirmed and promoted achievements, and at the same time carried out a resolute struggle against incorrect thoughts and styles. Rao Yang County also achieved results using the same method, but Suning's failure to pay attention to equipping and cultivating backbones when mobilizing trainees and in the study, therefore, showed weakness in ideological struggle and transformation, and the learning effect was not great.
Discovering and Cultivating Activists Typical Reports Enlighten All
    　　Resolving the Relationship between New and Old Cadres Learning Work Methods and Styles
In in-depth self-criticism, two currently urgent problems were solved: First, the issue of the relationship between new and old cadres. In the Shen County training class, there were many old cadres, and the atmosphere of dissatisfaction with the Party rectification prevailed in the early stage of learning. New cadres spoke less at the beginning, but were not convinced in their hearts, saying behind their backs: "Don't quack, we still have to rectify in the autumn." The leadership gradually changed this situation according to the trainees' ideological situation. Through discussion, four relationships were resolved—the relationship between party members and the party, the relationship between the party and the masses, the relationship between new and old cadres, and the relationship between the poor peasant associations and the new peasant associations—generally making the old cadres realize their shortcomings and making a more appropriate self-examination of the deviations in the Party rectification, and achieving preliminary ideological consistency between new and old cadres. Second, the Party School village cadre team specifically studied "leadership methods and work style" in order to overcome the bad style of coercion and command. Initially, it was generally believed that coercion and command was not a mistake, anyway, it was not for oneself, not corruption. It was thought that being responsible to the higher authorities meant not being able to be responsible to the masses, that the masses were backward, and giving things was okay, but asking for things was not. Later, after studying the bad results caused by coercion and command, for example, a certain village sent laborers to demolish the Zhengding city wall. The village was small, the number of laborers required was large, and the time limit was short. It was estimated that mobilization would not be successful, so some "meat head households" were picked and forced to go. Soon after arriving in Zhengding, they all ran back, offending people and not getting things done. In this way, the trainees slowly realized that the style of coercion and command would separate the party and themselves from the masses and would harm the work! At the same time, the trainees were induced to deeply reflect on themselves, and everyone examined that the village affairs were not easy to handle for the following reasons: First, the cadres were unfair in handling affairs, such as the issue of labor, some people contributed more, some contributed less, and some did not contribute at all, and those who contributed more were unwilling to go. Second, some cadres could not play an exemplary leading role, such as expanding the army, some cadres had three brothers, and none of them went, letting the two brothers go, of course, people would not want to go; and some cadres pretended to take the lead, which also increased the difficulty of expanding the army. Third, there was no preparation in advance, and they only held the Buddha's feet at the last minute, such as the issue of labor, the higher authorities often stipulated a short time and a large task, eager to complete it, without education and mobilization in advance, and they were at a loss when the task came. The trainees realized from the self-examination that the coercion and command caused by the above reasons was the responsibility of the cadres, not the backwardness of the masses. Finally, everyone discussed and concluded that cadres should play an exemplary leading role, not be selfish, and every work should have propaganda and sufficient preparation, unite the active, improve the backward, and educate and criticize the wrong, and jointly abide by the democratic discipline formulated by the masses. This issue was generally understood in theory by the trainees, but not completely in their minds. For example, a few people still said that in some cases, coercion and command were still necessary. This requires education and assistance in future practical work to completely overcome the bad style and gradually establish a democratic style.

Editor's note: (1) It is absolutely necessary for the leadership to review the deviations in the Party rectification and make appropriate self-criticism; however, the achievements of the Party rectification, and the fact that impurities within the Party must be rectified, must be affirmed unswervingly. Only in this way can party members of peasant origin and party members with non-proletarian consciousness be raised to the level of the Party Constitution. (2) Serious criticism and self-criticism must be carried out among party members and cadre trainees. This is an extremely important part of conducting intra-party education; however, it is necessary to distinguish between right and wrong, and to distinguish between the seriousness of errors, whether they are accidental or consistent, conscious or unconscious, etc., and give them respective treatment. Those who are affirmed in the Party rectification, those who are wrong are corrected, and those who are serious are reduced. Without this step, simply solving ideological problems is not enough.

　　提高政治思想与整党认识
  　冀中大量集训村干
    【冀中讯】中共冀中区党委为了使村级干部与党员正确接受中央与华北局关于一九四八年任务的指示，并彻底纠正偏向，端正政策，特于七月决定大量训练村干部与党员，为秋后完成整党建政与结束土改、转向生产工作作好思想准备与组织准备。七、八月间正当挂锄的农隙期间，各县训练班先后开办，有些县第一期已结束，第二期已开课。深、赵、藁（城）、肃（宁）等四县及区党委党校村干队，第一期训练学员共一九二八人，时间一、二十天不等。其主要经验是开始放手让学员发表意见，领导上实行工作检讨，然后发动学员开展严肃的批评与自我批评，最后解决思想上与作风上迫切需要解决的问题。凡是这样做的，效果都好，反之成绩即小。现将该区训练班解决干部思想问题的经验，介绍出来，以供参考。
    　　　　动员学员必须慎重　滥送滥收很难办好
    首先动员学员必须慎重负责，严格条件。冀中八地委确定受训人员一般是村支部书记、组织、宣传及农代会正副主席，生产、保卫、武装等委员，不要当过伪军伪办公人员的、蜕化干部、政治面目不清的、“狗腿”、二流子、顶名代替的等等。因为要在最短的时间内，训练出一批骨干分子，使他们能够担当农村整党与结束土改的繁重任务，如滥送滥收，这种短期训练班便很难办好。赵县、藁城的教训是很痛苦的，该县各区村送来的学员中有七十余岁的老翁、六十多岁的儿子；有将上炕的孕妇、十七岁的小孩；有投敌叛变被开除党籍的人、分区委又介绍他为正式党员的；有带着一两个小孩并正发着疟疾的女同志，有子替父，兄替弟顶名冒充的等恶劣现象。赵县送来四八八名中，因不合格退回者一三一名，逃跑者十名。原因是对这次训练村干的意义认识不够，并怕受训后，村里工作受损失，所以便多叫次要干部来，甚至为了凑数，还有欺骗、强迫的等花样。有的欺骗说：“去开七八天会就回来了”。有的威胁说：“你是党员要服从组织调动，不去用绳捆着去”。来的学员有的浪费公款，随便带钱的，赵县估计，在全体学员中用公款的要占百分之八十以上，十一区西河庄两个学员带了三万元。赵、藁县委会检讨了以上缺点后，再次指示区村，反对这种自由主义态度，严格规定学员资格，以保证下期学习计划的完成。
    开学之始，领导上明确宣布对整党可以发表一切意见，分清是非责任，上级的错误上级负责。因为多数学员对整党不满，认为整党“一团糟”，老干部被整下去了。“功劳”包袱很沉重，觉得打跑了日本，蒋介石又打跑了一半，天下咱们打下来，现在却被搬了“石头”。因此有的想“学习了回去也不工作”。有的骂工作组，有的觉得冤枉。深县六八二个学员中，老干部占绝大多数，内有曾被扣押过的四四名，错停党籍或动了一些土地而不满土改整党的一二九名，因混乱思想的波及一时也跟着喊“一团糟”的老干部二七八名，以上共占全体学员的百分之六十六；对土改整党表示拥护并在村中积极工作的有二三一人，其中新干部较多，仅占学员的百分之三十四。因此，开学之初，不少人是抱着前来“诉苦”“伸冤”的态度，有的并存在报复思想。这时领导上必须热情相待，诱导启发，尽情的让他们说出想说的话，不要怕发牢骚，不要急于批评他们。领导上要根据大家提出的事实及整党中的某些错误，进行诚恳的适当的自我检讨，深县县委在举行开学典礼时，即对整党中的偏向或错误，作了适当的自我批评，同时号召大家虚心检讨自己，坚持真理，修正错误。经过这些努力，学员们便慢慢冷静下来，逐渐转向检讨自己方面来。
    　　　　领导上诚恳进行检讨　学员批评与自我批评
    这时要紧紧依靠已涌现的积极分子与较好分子，带头检讨，开展批评与自我批评。党校村干队根据党员课本每课的内容，联系自己，进行反省，最初一部分人认为农村党该整，但自己不该整。等到学了怎样做一个好共产党员，拿出党员的六条标准来衡量自己一下的时候，谁也感到自己有缺点了，认为自己也该整。深县出了几个题目：（一）为什么实行土改与整党？（二）你村土改、整党中发生的偏向？（三）土改、整党成绩大，还是错误大？（四）现在你村存在什么问题，应如何解决？在讨论中思想斗争是很尖锐的，这时主要的思想情况是：赞成好人来整党，反对坏人来整党；整党出了偏差的村，领导整党的人应受到责备。很多老干部以“功臣”自居，诉苦喊冤，不检讨自己；有的灰心丧气，不干工作，怕再整党。在讨论中发现了与培养了积极分子与较好分子，鼓励他们做典型报告。计有：一、被富农成份的国民党区分部组织委员袁西财及富农郝顺花篡夺了的西李村支部，正派党员被压制，群众斗争被阻挠。二、流氓张焕章掌握的南和乐寺支部，贪污公款，强迫命令，乱搞女人。三、利仁村刘振生因此逃亡军人贫农中的干部阎明治有私人意见，被阎故意扣押，父妻二人气病而死，但自己仍积极工作，不报复不悲观。四、小吕邑党员干部王万金。五、西关街郭振谦，都谈了被扣后由悲观到积极工作的思想转变。这五个典型材料，均由当事人亲自报告。前两个支部材料报告后，使学员认识到了整党的重要性，还联系了本村情况，进行检讨；后三个典型人的报告，对存在悲观、消极、报复情绪的一些老干部，有极深刻的教育意义，特别是刘振生的报告，使大家深受感动。接着结合学员的思想情况，报告了该县土改整党的简要总结，再贯彻整党教育，使学员思想上对过去和今后整党均有了进一步的正确认识，并进一步的深刻的检讨自己，开展批评与自我批评，肯定与发扬成绩，同时对不正确的思想与作风作坚决的斗争。饶阳县用同样方法亦收到了效果，但是肃宁因在以前动员学员时及在学习中未注意配备与培养骨干，因此，在思想斗争与改造中表现了软弱无力，学习效果不大。
  发现培养积极分子　典型报告启发全体
        　　解决新老干部关系　学习工作方法作风
    在深入检讨中，解决了两个目前迫切需要解决的问题：第一、新老干部关系问题。深县训练班老干部多，学习初期，对整党不满的空气占了上风，新干部开始发言少，但内心不服气，背后说：“不用呱呱，秋后还得整。”领导上根据学员思想情况逐渐转变这一局面。经过讨论，解决了四种关系——党员与党的关系，党群关系，新老干部关系，贫农团与新农会关系——一般做到了使老干部认识了自己的缺点，与比较恰当的检讨了整党中的偏向，达到了新老干部思想上的初步一致。第二、党校村干队专门学习了“领导方法与工作作风”，以克服强迫命令的恶劣作风。最初普遍的认为强迫命令不是错误，反正不是为了自己，不是贪污了腐化了。认为对上级的任务负责，就不能对群众负责，认为群众落后，给东西可以，要东西就不行。以后研究了强迫命令所造成的恶果，比如某村派夫拆正定城墙，村小要的夫多，限时间又短，估计动员不成，便挑了一些“肉头户”，强迫人去，到正定不久，便都跑了回来，人也得罪人，事也没办成。这样学员们慢慢的认识到强迫命令作风会使党使自己脱离了群众，会使工作受到危害！同时诱导学员深入反省自己，大家检讨出来村里的事不好办，有这么几个原因：第一、干部办事不公，象出夫问题，有人出的多，有人出的少，有的还不出，出夫多的就不愿意去。第二、干部有的不能起模范带头作用，如扩兵，有的干部哥儿三个，一个也不去，让哥儿俩的去，当然人家就不愿去；还有的干部假带头，也给扩兵增加了困难。第三、事先没准备，临时抱佛脚，如出夫问题，上级往往规定时间短，任务大，急于完成，事先没有教育动员，任务一来就抓瞎。学员们从检讨中认识到由于以上种种原因产生的强迫命令，那是干部应负责的，并不是群众落后。最后大家讨论的结果，干部要起模范带头作用，不自私自利，每件工作要有宣传酝酿和足够的准备，团结积极的，提高落后的，教育批评有错误的，通过群众订出民主纪律，共同遵守。这个问题，一般学员在理论上认识了，但在思想上尚未完全搞通，如有少数人还说在某种情况下，还得强迫命令。这就需要在今后实际工作中进行教育与帮助，将坏的作风完全克服掉，将民主作风逐渐树立起来。
    　　　　　　
    编者按：（一）领导上检讨整党中的偏向并作适当的自我批评是完全必要的；但对整党成绩，党内不纯必须整顿、应毫不动摇地肯定起来，唯有如此，才能使农民出身的党员及带有非无产阶级意识的党员，提高到党章的水平。（二）在党员与干部学员中，要开展严肃的批评与自我批评，这是进行党内教育极重要的一个环节；但必须分清是非轻重，分清错误大小，偶然的或是一贯的，自觉的或是不自觉的等等，分别给以处理、在整党中处分对者肯定之，错者改正之，重者减轻之，没有这一步骤，单纯解决思想问题，是不行的。
