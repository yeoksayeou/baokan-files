Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 3rd: Xinhua News Agency is instructed to declare: The so-called letter from Zhou Enlai to Zhang Zhizhong published in certain newspapers and periodicals in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in July and August is entirely fabricated by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. According to reliable intelligence, as the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's military defeats become increasingly obvious, especially after suffering disastrous defeats in the Kaifeng and Yudu campaigns, some American imperialist elements are increasingly losing confidence in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's combat capabilities. They are attempting to use reactionary warlords and politicians such as Li Zongren, He Yingqin, and Song Ziwen to deceive the Chinese people with a facade of peace and replace Chiang Kai-shek in continuing to oppose the Chinese people's revolutionary forces when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is even more defeated and unable to maintain its position. This conspiracy by the American imperialists has caused panic among the Chiang Kai-shek direct line bandit gang, especially the CC clique. Therefore, the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department forged the so-called letter from Zhou Enlai to Zhang Zhizhong, issued it to party headquarters in various provinces and cities, and instructed Kuomintang secret agents in major cities to spread and fabricate rumors, thereby striking at Li, He, Song, etc., in order to unite the bandit gang internally and maintain the position of bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek. If asked why the CC clique wants to strike at Zhang Zhizhong, it is because Zhang Zhizhong, although loyal to Chiang Kai-shek, is worried about Chiang Kai-shek's military situation. When Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting with Zhang Zhizhong, Hu Zongnan, and others in Xi'an in late June, Zhang Zhizhong inquired whether Chiang Kai-shek could hold peace talks at the moment. After this sentence was leaked, the CC clique believed that it was necessary to strike at Zhang Zhizhong. However, the central purpose of the CC clique's spreading rumors is that they fear that the Americans are trying to use Li, He, Song, etc. to replace Chiang Kai-shek. For the sake of protecting Chiang Kai-shek and his direct line's position, they believe it is necessary to expose this in advance. As for the anti-communist speech drafted by the CC clique during this period and given to Weng Wenhao to read on the radio, it was mainly intended for the Americans. The purpose was to beg some Americans who had lost confidence in Chiang Kai-shek to continue to protect Chiang Kai-shek. They told these Americans that even the conspiracy to deceive the Chinese people with peace talks should not be allowed, as this would not only harm the interests of Chiang Kai-shek and his direct line, but also the interests of the United States. The truth about all the so-called peace rumors recently is this.

  　揭露蒋匪捏造和谣
    【新华社陕北三日电】新华社奉命声明：七八月间国民党统治区域某些报纸刊物上所登载的所谓周恩来给张治中的信，完全是蒋介石匪帮的捏造。根据可靠情报，当蒋介石匪帮的军事失败愈益明显，特别是在开封及豫东作战中遭受惨败以后，某些美帝国主义分子对于蒋介石匪帮的作战能力表示愈益丧失信心，企图利用李宗仁、何应钦、宋子文等反动军阀政客，于蒋介石匪帮更加失败无法维持时，以和平的假面具欺骗中国人民，代替蒋介石继续反对中国人民革命力量。美帝国主义者的这一阴谋，使蒋介石嫡系匪帮尤其是ＣＣ系感到恐慌，乃由国民党中央宣传部伪造所谓周恩来给张治中的信，发给各省市党部，并指使各大城市的国民党特务分子散布和谣，借此给李、何、宋等以打击，以便团结匪帮内部，保持匪首蒋介石的地位。若问ＣＣ系为什么要打击张治中，则因张治中虽然忠于蒋介石，却对蒋介石的军事形势感到忧虑。当六月下旬蒋介石召集张治中、胡宗南等在西安开会时，张治中曾探问蒋介石目前是否可以举行和谈。这句话泄露出来以后，ＣＣ系便认为有打击张治中的必要。但ＣＣ系散布和谣的中心目的，还是他们恐惧美国人企图利用李、何、宋等代替蒋介石，为保护蒋介石及其嫡系的地位起见，认为有预先揭露之必要。至于在这一期间由ＣＣ起草交给翁文灏在广播电台上照念的那篇反共演说词，则主要地是给美国人看的，其目的是哀求某些对蒋介石丧失信心的美国人继续对蒋介石给以保护。他们告诉这些美国人，就是欺骗中国人民的和谈阴谋也使不得，这不但对蒋介石及其嫡系的利益有妨碍，即对美国的利益也是有妨碍的。最近时期一切所谓和谣的真相，就是如此。
