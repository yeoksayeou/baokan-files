Protecting Draft Animals

Today, this agency published a news item regarding livestock deaths in North China. The reduction and death of livestock is not a unique phenomenon in parts of North China; similar situations exist in other liberated areas as well. Due to the decade-long war, the number of livestock in rural areas has already decreased significantly. In particular, last year, due to the severe devastation by the Kuomintang bandit troops, the famine, and certain errors in our policies regarding supporting the front lines, mutual aid labor exchange, and land reform, the reduction of draft animals was more severe than in the past. In order to develop agricultural production and improve our production even slightly, this issue deserves serious attention from leadership organs in all regions. Based on reports from North China and past reports from other regions, we believe the following three issues are worth raising for everyone to study.

First, wartime labor conscription is one of the important reasons for the reduction of draft animals. In particular, long-distance conscription is more likely to cause concerns among farmers. Last winter, in order to protect draft animals, the Bohai Region of Shandong Province stipulated that draft animals in the central area should cease conscription and that military supply transportation should be changed to a "contracted relay transportation" method. This involves organizing the livestock and vehicles of the masses in sections to transport military supplies, with a certain amount of freight paid according to the distance and weight. In this way, military supply transportation changes from a burden on the people to a profitable side business for the people. Farmers not only no longer sell their livestock but also buy back livestock to contract for military supply transportation. At the same time, transportation capacity is greatly improved. In the past, a large cart could only carry 700 jin and travel 30-40 li per day, but now it can carry more than 1,000 jin and travel 60-70 li per day, one large cart being equivalent to two large carts in the past. In the past, the government did not pay freight but had to provide grain and fodder for the people and horses of two large carts. Now, with only one large cart used, the freight paid is not more than the fodder provided in the past, and may even be less. Similar experiences in North China and Northwest China have proven that stopping the conscription of draft animals in the central area and changing to a contracted transportation method is an important measure to protect draft animals and benefit both the public and private sectors. At the same time, it can also limit the arbitrary conscription by rear-area organs, which hinders mass production.

Second, violating the principles of voluntariness and equal value in mutual aid labor exchange is another important reason for the reduction of draft animals. In the past, in some places, the consent of the draft animal owners was often not sought, and draft animals were arbitrarily sent to till fields or participate in mutual aid labor exchange, and even the land of military and government families had to be tilled first (in some areas, even the draft animals of middle peasants had to till the land for poor peasants first) before they could till their own land. The compensation for draft animals participating in mutual aid labor exchange was often too low (such as one animal labor being equivalent to only one human labor), or even non-existent. In this way, naturally no farmer would want to raise draft animals. In order to encourage farmers to raise draft animals, the principles of voluntariness and equal value must be strictly observed in mutual aid labor exchange, that is, the use of draft animals must be with the consent of the owners, and the method of valuing labor exchange must be fair and reasonable so that farmers who raise draft animals can also obtain certain benefits from the mutual aid labor exchange. Draft animals raised by middle peasants are equally protected and must not be discriminated against. In order to truly realize the voluntary principle of labor exchange, governments in all regions must announce to the people, prohibit all coercion, and allow all members joining labor exchange groups to freely withdraw from the labor exchange group at any time without any obstruction.

Third, last year, during the land reform, many draft animals of landlords and rich peasants were often distributed to several peasant families to be jointly raised. After the land reform, most poor peasants are still unable to raise a draft animal independently, which is certainly an objective difficulty. However, joint raising of draft animals still has many problems that are not easy to solve today, such as everyone being unwilling to feed more fodder when taking turns feeding, and everyone not cherishing the animals when taking turns using them. Due to insufficient nutrition and overwork, jointly raised draft animals often become increasingly thin and even die. Today's mutual aid teams and labor exchange groups are still based on individual economy, with each family as a production unit, and the farmers' self-interest cannot be immediately eliminated. Therefore, such phenomena are really difficult to avoid. In the future, it is best to encourage independent raising of draft animals. Farmers who independently raise draft animals can exchange labor with farmers who do not have draft animals, or lease them out, sign contracts, specifying how much land to till, how much fodder to provide, or other compensation, or simply sell the livestock to farmers who need draft animals. In some areas, forcing collectivism and encouraging joint raising of draft animals has proven to be completely inappropriate today.

The above three points are the important keys to protecting draft animals. In addition, there are other methods of protection and reward, such as appropriately reducing the burden on draft animals (such as raising one ox or mule can reduce the amount of public grain or public grass to be contributed), encouraging the breeding of draft animals, purchasing draft animals from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and training veterinarians to treat livestock diseases. Governments in all regions should learn from each other and earnestly promote these measures to protect draft animals in order to facilitate the recovery and improvement of rural production.

### 保护耕畜

专栏：新华社短评

　　保护耕畜
    今天本社发表了一个关于华北牲畜死亡的消息。牲畜的减少和死亡，并不是华北部分地区的特殊现象，其他各解放区亦有类似情形。农村中的牲畜由于十年的战争，已经大量减少，特别是去年由于国民党匪军的严重摧残，灾荒，和我们在支援前线、变工互助、土地改革中的某些政策上的错误，耕畜的减少比较过去更为严重。为着发展农业生产，把我们的生产提高一寸，这个问题值得引起各地领导机关严重注意。根据华北报导，和过去其他地区的报导，我们觉得有下列三个问题值得提出来供大家研究。
    一、战争支差是引起耕畜减少的重要原因之一，尤其是长距离的支差，更容易引起农民的顾虑。去冬山东渤海区为着保护耕畜，曾经规定中心地区牲畜停止支差，军需运输改用“包工接力运输”办法。即分段组织群众的牲畜和车辆，包运军需物品，按路程，按重量，给以一定数量的运费。这样军需运输就从人民的负担，变为人民有利可图的副业，农民不但不再出卖牲畜，而且买回牲畜包运军需物品。同时运输力亦大大提高，过去一辆大车只装到七百斤，日行三四十里，现在可装一千多斤，日行六七十里，一辆大车可抵两辆大车。过去政府不给运费，但须供给两辆大车人马的粮秣。现在只用一辆大车，所付运费并不多于过去所供草料，甚至反而节省。华北、西北等地区也曾有类似的经验，证明中心地区停止耕畜支差，改用包运办法，是保护耕畜，公私两利的重要措施。同时亦可限制后方机关的随意支差，妨碍群众生产。
    二、变工中违反自愿和等价的原则，是使耕畜减少的另一重要原因。过去有些地方往往不征求耕畜主人的同意，把耕畜随便派去代耕或参加变工，甚至必须先把军属工属的地耕好（曾经有些地区中农的耕畜还要先替贫农耕种），才能耕自己的地。耕畜参加变工往往代价太少（如一个畜工只顶一个人工），甚至毫无代价。这样，农民自然谁都不愿饲养耕畜。为着奖励农民饲养耕畜，在变工中必须严格遵守自愿和等价的原则，即使用耕畜必须征求主人的同意，变工计价办法必须公平合理，使饲养耕畜的农民也能从变工中获得一定的利益。中农所养耕畜同样保护，不得歧视。为了切实实现变工的自愿原则，各地政府必须布告人民，禁止一切强迫，必须允许一切加入变工组的成员随时自由退出变工组，不得有任何阻难。
    三、去年在土改中，许多地主富农的耕畜，往往分给几家农民合养。土改以后大多数的贫农仍然无力独养一个耕畜，这固然是客观上的困难，但合养耕畜在今天还有很多问题不易解决，如轮流饲养大家不愿多喂草料，轮流使用大家不加爱惜。合养的耕畜由于营养不足和过度劳动，往往日益消瘦，以至于死。今天的互助组，变工组仍以个体经济为基础，一家一户为一生产单位，农民们的自利思想也不可能即时消灭。因此这样的现象，实在很难避免。今后最好奖励独养耕畜，独养耕畜的农民可与无耕畜的农民变工，或实行出租，订立合同，耕多少土地，供给多少草料，或其他代价，或者索性把牲口卖给需要耕畜的农民。有些地区强求集体，奖励合养耕畜，这在今天，证明是完全不适当的。
    以上三点是保护耕畜的重要关键。此外还有其它保护和奖励的办法，如耕畜可以斟酌情形减轻负担（如养一牛骡即可少出多少公粮或公草），奖励繁殖耕畜，和向国民党统治区购买耕畜，培养兽医医治牲畜疾病等。这些保护耕畜的措施，各地政府均应互相学习，认真推行，以利农村生产的恢复和提高。
