Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 29th - According to a Reuter's report from Singapore on the 24th, the British army's first phase in the war against the people of Malaya has failed. The Malayan liberation movement is so powerful that, according to the British government's own statistics, when the democratic forces' united front called for a boycott of the elections in early summer, 94 percent of Singapore voters refused to participate in the farcical elections. The Communist Party, which is now fighting to defend Malayan freedom, had approximately 10,000 members in July. The armed forces under its leadership have been officially named the Malayan People's Anti-British Army. There are no precise statistics on its numbers, but at least the majority of the 8,000-strong wartime People's Anti-Japanese Army has been mobilized. In the first phase of the war, the British made much of their "jungle clearing operations," but failed to capture any people's leaders or destroy guerrilla headquarters. The British army's offensive was actually used to intimidate the people, and as a result, even British officers themselves admit that the difficulty lies in "finding the enemy." Entering the jungle to sweep, the only results brought back were the killing of small batches of "suspects"; the rocket-launching Spitfire fighters only ravaged villages suspected of being guerrilla concentration points. Now, the British are planning to launch a "general offensive" in an attempt to gain control of major cities and break the main force of the guerrillas, driving them into the jungle areas; however, no responsible official believes that this war is sure to be won. The myth of "red rebels" spread in Singapore, London, New York and other places is intended to cover up the fact, well known to observers here, that the Singapore government is politically and morally bankrupt.

　　马来亚人民武装保卫自由英军第一阶段作战遭惨败
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据电通社记者二十四日自新加坡报导：英军在反对马来亚人民的战争中的第一阶段业已失败。马来亚解放运动已如此强大，据英政府自己的统计，在今年夏初民主力量的统一战线号召抵制选举时，新加坡选民的百分之九十四，就拒绝去参加滑稽戏似的选举。现在正为保卫马来亚自由而战的共产党，在七月间拥有党员约万人，它所领导下的武装力量，已正式定名为马来亚人民抗英军，其数量尚无确切统计，但至少战时人民抗日军八千人中的大多数已动员起来。在战争第一阶段中英国人大事渲染的“丛林扫荡战”，并未搜捕到人民领袖或破坏游击队总部。英军的攻势实际上乃用以恫吓人民，其结果，即英国军官自己也承认：困难在于“寻找敌人”；进入丛林扫荡，带回来的战果仅是打死小批“嫌疑”分子；发射火箭的喷火式战斗机，则只蹂躏了被疑为游击队兵力集中点的村庄。现在，英国又在计划发动“总攻势”，以图获得对主要城市的控制并击破游击队的主力，把他们驱入丛林地带；但是，没有一个负责官员相信这场战争一定就会胜利。新加坡、伦敦、纽约等地传播的“赤色叛徒”的神话，其用意在于掩盖此间观察家所共知的这一事实，即新加坡政府在政治上及道义上均已破产。
