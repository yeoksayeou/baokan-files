　　How to Deduct Farmers' Production Costs?
    Editor:
    I have several questions regarding class division that I don't understand, and I hope you can answer them.
    1. If exploitation exceeds one-quarter, it is considered a rich peasant. What should be deducted when calculating capital? Some say deduct workers' wages, food, seeds, and fertilizer; others say only deduct workers' wages and food, but not seeds and fertilizer. Which is correct?
    2. The so-called wages, food, and consumption of seeds and fertilizer are usually in a ratio of three to one, but I don't know which is considered one part and which is considered three parts regarding wages, food, seeds, and fertilizer.
    3. Furthermore, if the land exceeds the peasant's average landholding by more than one to two times, how much exploitation is considered a rich peasant?

    Answer:
    1. The boundary between rich peasants and middle peasants is whether the exploitation income exceeds one-quarter of the total income. When calculating the exploitation income from hired laborers, only the laborers' food and wages are deducted, but not the constant capital such as seeds and fertilizer consumed during their labor.
    2. Here, the so-called three to one means that wages and food account for three parts, and fertilizer and seeds account for one part.
    3. If a farmer's land exceeds the average landholding of a general middle peasant by more than one to two times, they should be considered a rich peasant if their exploitation income exceeds one-eighth of their total income. If their land exceeds the average landholding of a general middle peasant by two times or more, they should be considered a rich peasant even if their exploitation income is less than one-eighth of their total income. However, if there is indeed no exploitation, they should still be considered a middle peasant and not a rich peasant. —Editor

　　怎样扣除农民生产成本？编辑同志：
    我现在对划阶级有几个问题不明白，请答复为盼。
    一、凡剥削超过四分之一就是富农，在扣除资本时应当扣除那些？有的说扣除工人的工资、吃食、种子、肥料；有的说光扣除工人的工资、吃食，不扣除种子、肥料。究竟那个对？
    二、所谓工资吃粮与种子肥料等消耗，通常为三比一，但不知工资吃食种子肥料到底那叫一份那叫三份？
    三、还有土地超过农民一倍以上到两倍以上的，有多少剥削算个富农？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　冀鲁豫东阿一区徐延兴
    答：一、以剥削收入是否超过总收入四分之一为富农与中农的界限，计算对雇工的剥削收入时，只扣除雇工的吃粮工资，而不扣除其劳动过程中所消耗的种子肥料等不变资本。
    二、这里所谓三比一，是工资吃粮占三份，肥料种子等占一份。
    三、农民占有土地如超过一般中农平均所有一倍以上二倍以下时，则剥削收入超过总收入八分之一即应认为富农。若超过一般中农土地二倍或二倍以上，则其剥削收入虽不及总收入八分之一者也应认为富农。但若确实毫无剥削，则仍应认为是中农，而不应认为是富农。——编者
