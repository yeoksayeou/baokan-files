[Ji Lu Yu Electric] Guancheng convened a meeting of county warehouse cadres and financial cadres to examine the reasons for the repeated spoilage of public grain. The main reason was that county warehouse staff did not conduct timely and in-depth inspections, often relying on reports from the districts. Even when they went to the villages to inspect, they only talked to the village cadres, and sometimes only looked at the surface of the grain in the warehouses, without conducting thorough inspections. Some warehouse management personnel were irresponsible, neglecting the grain once it was allocated. Sometimes the allocating authorities did not pick up the grain in time, leading to the spoilage or infestation of large quantities of grain. The procrastination and irresponsibility in warehouse work were also serious. Some warehouses reported that the public grain was damp and needed to be dried, but the county warehouse staff did not dare to take responsibility for such matters, and had to request approval from the Prefectural Commissioner's Office Finance Section. However, due to the cumbersome procedures, the matter was delayed, causing a lot of public grain to rot. The grain stored in the warehouses was too much, making inspection difficult. Before it could be allocated, the grain at the bottom had already rotted. Based on the above situation, it was decided that warehouses should be separated in the future, and no single warehouse should concentrate too much grain. The two staff members of the county warehouse, in addition to transferring grain, should each be responsible for two districts, inspecting each warehouse once every ten days. After heavy rain, inspections should be carried out immediately. If spoilage is found, it should be reported immediately, and the grain in that warehouse should be allocated early to avoid wasting manpower. In the future, if public grain is found to be rotten again, the warehouse staff should bear appropriate responsibility.

　　观城检查公粮仓库规定今后保管办法
    【冀鲁豫电】观城召开县仓库干部与财经干部会议，检查公粮屡次腐烂的原因，主要是县仓库员及时深入检查不够，常常听听区上的汇报就算了。即是到村里检查，也只是和村干部谈谈，有时也到仓房去看看表皮的粮食，并不做彻底的检查。某些仓库管理人员不负责任，把粮食批出去就不管了，有时拨粮机关并未及时取走，致使大批粮食腐烂，或生了虫子。仓库工作上的拖拉作风和不负责任的现象也很厉害。有的仓房报告公粮受了潮湿，应当晒晒，县仓库员对这种事不敢大胆负责，还得请示专署财经科批准，但因来回手续麻烦，拖延了时间，使很多公粮腐烂了。仓库存的粮食太多，检查很不容易。还没有拨完，下边的已经烂了。根据上述情况，确定今后仓房要分立，一个仓房不要集中粮食太多。县仓库的两个干事，除调运粮食外，各分工负责两个区，每十天到各仓房检查一次。大雨过后，要立即检查，发现腐烂立即报告，并提早拨发该仓房粮食，以免浪费人力。今后如再发现公粮腐烂，仓库干事应负适当责任。
