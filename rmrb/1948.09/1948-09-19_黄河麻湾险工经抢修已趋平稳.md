Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: The Mawan dangerous works on the Yellow River in Bohai, Shandong, suddenly became critical on the 19th of last month. After emergency repairs by the county flood control headquarters and flood control workers, who braved the rain to add cofferdams and embankments and throw more than 500 cubic meters of stones, the situation has stabilized. The dangerous works are located at the end of a 20-li straight riverbed, where the river channel suddenly turns sharply, and the bottom base is mostly quicksand, making it extremely difficult to consolidate. During the flood season, the scouring intensified, the large sandbank in front of the dangerous works collapsed, and the main current approached, threatening the new dam foundation that had just been completed this spring. In addition to deciding to increase the number of river watchers along the river and strengthen the defense of the works, Putai County has also mobilized 10,000 sandbags, more than 700 wooden stakes, more than 100,000 jin of straw, 300 cubic meters of stones, requisitioned 750,000 jin of green willow from various districts, and continued to tie up 89 cubic meters of bundled bricks in preparation for emergency repairs.

　　黄河麻湾险工经抢修已趋平稳
    【新华社华东十三日电】山东渤海黄河麻湾险工，于上月十九日突告吃紧，经该县防汛指挥部及防汛员工冒雨抢修，加厢加埽，抛石五百余方，已趋平稳。该险工位于二十里笔直河床之端，河道成陡转急转之势，且底基多为流沙，极难巩固。伏汛中，溜势加剧，险工前面大沙滩坍陷，大溜迫近，今年春始修完成的新坝根而宣告吃紧。现蒲台县除决定增加沿河看水屋子，加强对平工的防守外，并调集麻袋一万条，木桩七百余根，秸料十万余斤，石头三百方，向各区征青柳七十五万斤和继续捆好捆砖八十九方，以备抢险之用。
