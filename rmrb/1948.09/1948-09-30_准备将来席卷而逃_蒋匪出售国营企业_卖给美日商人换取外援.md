　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th -- Following closely on the heels of the "currency reform," the Kuomintang reactionary government has once again revamped five so-called "state-owned" enterprises into "limited liability companies," issuing and selling partial shares to carry out its plunderous and treasonous schemes. The enterprises for sale include the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the China Textile Construction Corporation, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the Taiwan Paper Corporation, and the Tianjin Paper and Pulp Company. A total of 5,640,000 shares are being sold, at a price of 100 pseudo-gold yuan per share, totaling 564 million yuan. This accounts for approximately 28% of the total capital of the five enterprises. The shares went on sale on the 10th of this month.

　　According to reports in Kuomintang-controlled newspapers, the Kuomintang reactionary and traitorous government's move is intended, in addition to converting unwieldy assets into liquid funds in preparation for a sweeping escape, to hand over these fruits of the Chinese people's victory to its masters in exchange for more foreign aid. On August 18th, an author in the Shanghai Business Daily analyzed the recipients of the sold enterprises, stating: "Ordinary people certainly do not have this capability; many high-ranking officials are pretending to be poor and dare not get involved; the only likely recipients are the wealthy, but with the government promoting special relief donations and planning a property tax, who would dare to walk into a trap? The only recipients are foreign merchants!" As early as May 3rd, a special dispatch from Nanjing in the Tianjin Xinsheng Evening News revealed: "American merchants are determined to acquire shares in Zhongfang [China Textile Construction Corporation] at a high price when it is sold. At the same time, it is rumored that some Japanese financial groups may also invest in Zhongfang through American hands." On the same day, according to the Tianjin Yishibao, a person in charge of the Zhongfang Company was invited by the American Consul in Shanghai to discuss the company's business situation, "and it is rumored that Zhongfang will be used as a material for American aid." Furthermore, American textile expert Dade arrived in Shanghai from Japan in late May to serve as a consultant to the Kuomintang's "Yarn Control Committee." From these indications, the purpose of the Kuomintang reactionary and traitorous government in selling "state-owned" enterprises this time is relatively clear.

### 准备将来席卷而逃　蒋匪出售国营企业　卖给美日商人换取外援

　　准备将来席卷而逃
  　蒋匪出售国营企业
  　卖给美日商人换取外援
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】国民党反动政府紧随“币改”之后，又将所谓“国营”事业五个单位改头换面为“股份有限公司”，并发售部分股票，进行其掠夺卖国的勾当。出售事业中有招商局轮船公司，中国纺织建设公司，台湾糖业公司，台湾纸业公司，天津造纸纸浆公司。出售股票共五百六十四万股，每股伪金圆券一百元，合计五亿六千四百万元。约占该五企业全部资本百分之二十八强。股票已于本月十日开始发售。
    据国民党区报纸消息披露，国民党反动卖国政府此举，除了想把笨重资产转变为流动资金，准备席卷而逃外；就是想把中国人民的这些胜利果实拱手献给其主子，以换取更多的外援。八月十八日上海商报某作者分析出售事业的受主称：“一般老百姓当然无此力量；许多大官正在装穷，也还不敢染指；比较可能的只有豪富，但政府正在推行救济特捐与拟办财产税的当儿，有谁敢自投罗网？那唯一的受主就非洋商莫属了！”早在五月三日，天津新生晚报南京专电即披露：“美国商人决将于中纺出售时，尽量以高价收购股票。同时传闻一部分日本财阀亦可能假美国之手，投资中纺。”同日，据天津益世报载：中纺公司某负责人曾应美驻沪领事之邀，商谈中纺公司业务情况，“并传中纺将作为美援之物质”。而美国纺织专家戴德亦于五月下旬由日本到沪担任国民党“纱管会”顾问。从这一些迹象观察，国民党反动卖国政府这次出售“国营”事业的目的就比较明白了。
