(Taiyue Telegram) The Yuncheng Yanchi Bian Hexing Salt Field, after being supported by the democratic government and implementing a policy of benefiting both labor and capital, has completed its annual plan of producing six million catties of salt ahead of schedule. It is now revising its plan to increase production. Bian Hexing was originally one of the four major salt merchants in Yuncheng Yanchi, but for ten years, it was unable to sustain itself under the cruel plunder of the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandit gang. After liberation, it has been rapidly restored with the active support of a loan of 80 million yuan from the democratic municipal government. The number of employees has increased to more than 150, and more than 40 new houses have been built. At that time, a plan was made to produce 6 million catties of salt by the end of the year. Subsequently, the government announced the method of levying taxes on the field and implemented the policy of benefiting both labor and capital for the development of production. Shopkeeper Wang said: "In the past, during the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandits, salt taxes were very heavy, and the field merchants could not continue to operate, so they had to focus on the workers. This caused the workers to be uneasy about production, and the output decreased rapidly. Now the democratic government's salt tax is very low, and labor-capital relations have been improved, the system of beating and scolding has been abolished, wages have been appropriately increased, attention has been paid to the sanitation of workers' housing, attention has been paid to improving workers' diets, and workers' difficulties have also been appropriately resolved, which has brought into play the workers' enthusiasm for production, so the annual salt production plan can be completed four months ahead of schedule." This time, the method of joint discussion was adopted when formulating the new production plan. On August 23, Shopkeeper Wang convened a meeting of foremen and worker representatives to discuss future production increase plans. He first explained that "Our annual salt production plan can be completed ahead of schedule, which is the result of the efforts of all employees. Now let's discuss how much more we can produce in the future and how to do it, and then make a plan." After discussion, according to the production capacity of all employees, a plan was first formulated to produce 60 mings, totaling 2.4 million catties, by the end of August. In terms of quality, we must ensure that everyone is willing to buy the goods.

　　运城卞合兴盐场
  　八月完成全年计划
    【太岳电】运城盐池卞合兴盐场，经民主政府扶植与实行劳资两利政策后，提前完成全年产盐六百万斤的计划。现又增订新计划。卞合兴原是运城盐池四大场商之一，但十年来，在日寇和蒋阎匪帮的残酷掠夺下，竟无法维持。解放后，经民主市政府贷款八千万元的积极扶植，已得到迅速恢复。职工则增到一百五十余人，又新建设房子四十余间，当时就订出了到年底产盐六百万斤的计划。接着政府宣布了就场征税办法与实行了发展生产劳资两利的方针。王掌柜说：“过去在日寇蒋阎匪统治时代盐税很重，场商更无法继续经营，就不得不从工人身上着眼。闹得工人不安心生产，产量迅速降低。现在民主政府盐税很低，又改善了劳资关系，废止打骂制度，适当增加工资，又对工人住房注意卫生，对工人的饮食注意调剂改善，对工人的困难亦适当的解决，发挥了工人的生产积极性，所以到年底的产盐计划能提前四个月完成。”此次订新生产计划时，更采用了共同讨论制订的办法。王掌柜于八月廿三日召集工头工人代表开会，讨论今后增产计划时，首先说明了“咱们全年出盐计划能提前完成，这是全体职工努力的结果，现在再来商量一下今后还能生产多少，如何搞法，再订一个计划。”经过讨论，根据全场职工生产力量，先拟定到八月底的计划，再生产六十铭，计二百四十万斤。在质量上，要作到货叫人人愿意买。
