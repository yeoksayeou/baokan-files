　　Bianqu Bank Jizhong Branch Issues Instructions
  　Adjust Agricultural Loans to Support Wheat Planting
    [Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong Branch of the Bianqu Bank has issued instructions regarding agricultural loan work during the autumn harvest and wheat planting season. The main points are as follows: (1) All agricultural loan cadres must fully devote themselves to the autumn harvest and wheat planting work, and jointly promote the supply and marketing cadres of the cooperatives and the Party and government cadres to organize mass production, and help the masses solve difficulties such as wheat seeds, fertilizers, livestock, and farm tools. The main methods: Rely on mutual assistance and borrowing among the masses to organize the private assets of the masses. Loans can only be used as a supplement when the masses still cannot solve the problem after borrowing and adjusting. Methods for adjusting and borrowing among the masses: exchanging coarse grains for wheat seeds, soybean cakes, and sesame cakes. For example, Raoyang plans to transport a portion of coarse grains to wheat-producing areas to exchange for wheat seeds, and mobilize the masses in non-wheat-harvesting areas to exchange coarse grains. In addition, inspire the masses to borrow from relatives and friends. Furthermore, carpenters and blacksmiths can be organized to repair farm tools, which is better than lending new farm tools. Call on the masses to deposit wheat seeds or other physical objects in promotion cooperatives or village cooperatives, and then transfer them to the masses as loans. Both deposits and loans should have interest. Explain to cadres and the masses that loans support mass production, and overcome the concept of charity relief. (2) Upholding the spirit of lending in kind, based on the experience of lending in kind for half a year, directly lending production materials is the best way to ensure that loans are effective and timely for production, and does not stimulate price fluctuations. In this autumn harvest and wheat planting, efforts should be made to lend entirely in kind. All regions should quickly prepare to transform the loans into wheat seeds, fertilizers, livestock and other production materials needed by the masses in a planned manner. (3) Attention should be paid to checking loans that have not been used for production and resolutely recovering them. All non-disaster area loans that are due should be recovered and placed in disaster areas. The masses should also be educated to strive to repay a portion of the loans before they are due to help the masses in disaster areas with production. If there are special difficulties that prevent recovery, the contracts should be renewed and revalued in kind. In principle, loans due in disaster areas should also be recovered. Do not exaggerate the difficulties in disaster areas and fail to collect them. However, for those who have genuinely used the loans for production but have suffered severe disasters, and whose lives would be affected after repayment, the contracts can be renewed and extended. (4) In order not to delay the agricultural season, there must be sound agricultural loan institutions. Therefore, branches should be established quickly where they have not yet been established. Especially in disaster areas, at least one branch should be established in every two districts. Li County and Xian County have proposed establishing specialized cadres in villages to help branches check, recover loans, and understand the situation. This method can be adopted for reference in various places. (5) In terms of loan methods, it is required that loans are good and fast, and the procedures are simple. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt the method of agricultural loan cadres and Party, government, and civilian cadres going to the countryside in combination, starting from organizing production, understanding the needs of the masses, and directly distributing loans to households. However, the decision-making on loans and the control of loan amounts, terms, interest rates, and procedures must be reviewed and managed exclusively by agricultural loan cadres to avoid misappropriation, charity, village-centrism, and confusion in loan procedures. (6) Loans should generally focus on villages severely affected by disasters.

　　边区银行冀中分行指示
  　调剂农贷扶助种麦
    【冀中电】边区银行冀中分行，对秋收种麦期间的农贷工作发出指示。要点如下：（一）一切农贷干部，要全力投入秋收种麦工作，协同推进社供销干部和党政干部组织群众生产，帮助群众解决麦种、肥料、牲口、农具等困难。主要方法：应依靠群众互助和借贷，组织群众私资浮财。贷款只能做为群众借贷调剂后仍无法解决时的补充。群众间调剂互借的办法：以粗粮换麦种、换豆饼、麻饼。如饶阳计划运一部粗粮到产麦区换麦种，发动未收麦地区群众拿粗粮换。另外启发群众自己向亲朋去借。再者可组织铁木匠修理农具，这个办法比贷给新农具还好。号召群众到推进社或村社存麦种或存其他实物，然后转贷给群众，存与贷都要有利息。对干部和群众说明贷款扶植群众生产，克服恩赐救济观点。（二）在掌握贷实精神上，根据半年贷实的经验，直接贷出生产资料，是保证贷款有效及时的用于生产，并不刺激物价波动的最好办法。这次秋收种麦中，应争取全部贷实，各地应赶快作好准备工作，有计划的将款变成麦种、肥料、牲口等群众所需要的生产资料。（三）应注意检查贷款没用在生产上的要坚决收回。非灾区一切到期的贷款，收回来放到灾区去。并应教育群众，对不到期的也争取零还一部，帮助灾区群众生产。如有特殊困难不能收回的，也应重换契约折实。灾区的到期贷款，原则上也要收回，不能夸大灾区困难而不去催收。但对真用于生产而受灾过重，还款后即影响其生活的，可换约转期。（四）为了不误农时，必须有健全的农贷机构。因此，未建立分社的应迅速建立。特别是灾区，至少要求每两个区有一个分社。蠡县、献县提出在村设专门干部，帮助分社检查、收回及了解情况等办法，各地可参考采用。（五）在贷款方法上，要求贷的好贷的快，手续简便。因此必须采取农贷干部和党政民干部结合下乡，从组织生产入手，了解群众需要，直接发放到户的办法。但在决定贷款和贷款数字、期限、利息、手续的掌握上，必须由农贷干部审查专管，以免发生挪用、恩赐、村本位和贷款手续混乱等现象。（六）贷款一般应以受灾重村庄为重点。
