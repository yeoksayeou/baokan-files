　　Allied Council for Japan Soviet Delegation Reissues Statement
  　US-Japan Authorities Must Rescind Anti-Strike Order
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th] TASS reports: Popov, spokesman for the Soviet delegation to the Allied Council for Japan, pointed out at a press conference held on the 6th that after the Soviet representative requested the cancellation of MacArthur's anti-labor letter and the Ashida government's decrees, the US representative, on the one hand, distorted the Far Eastern Commission's decision on granting Japanese workers the right to strike, saying that it did not apply to workers in government and public institutions; on the other hand, he quibbled that MacArthur's July 22nd statement was only a suggestion, not a directive. Popov said: "In its statement on September 3rd, the Japanese government asserted that MacArthur's letter was a directive." "And the Soviet representative pointed out in the Allied Council for Japan that the Far Eastern Commission's decision on the right to strike for workers did not contain any words that these rights do not apply to workers in state-owned factories and civil servants." Popov said that the British representative to the Allied Council for Japan also criticized the US measures and disagreed with the US representative's distortion of the decision. At this point, Popov condemned the US occupation authorities' persistent policy as "obstructing the democratic tendencies of the Japanese people, with the aim of suppressing the activities of democratic groups, especially trade unions." Popov concluded by stating that the Soviet Union still insists that the US-Japan authorities must rescind the anti-strike directives, orders, and suppressive actions.

　　对日委会苏代表团再度声明
  　美日当局必须取消反罢工令
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社讯：盟国对日委员会苏联代表团发言人波波夫，于六日举行的记者招待会上指出：在苏联代表要求取消反劳工的麦克阿瑟信件与芦田政府的法令之后，美代表曾一方面曲解远东委员会关于给予日本职工以罢工权利的决定，说是不适用于政府与公共机关企业的职工；另一方面又狡辩说：七月二十二日麦克阿瑟发出的只是建议而非指令。波波夫说：“日本政府在其九月三日的声明中，却断言麦克阿瑟的信乃是一项指令。”“而苏联代表在盟国对日委员会上曾指出远东委员会关于职工罢工权利的决定，并未载有这些权利不适用于国营工厂工人与公务员的字样。”波波夫说，盟国对日委员会的英国代表，也曾批评美方的措施，而且不同意美方代表对决定的曲解。至此，波波夫谴责美占领当局所固执的方针是“阻止日本人民的民主倾向，是以镇压民主团体的活动、特别是工会的活动为目的”。波波夫最后声明，苏联仍坚持美日当局必须取消反罢工的指令、命令与镇压行为。
