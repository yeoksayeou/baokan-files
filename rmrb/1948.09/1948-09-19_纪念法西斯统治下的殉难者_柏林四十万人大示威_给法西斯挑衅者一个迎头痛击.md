　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. TASS reports: 400,000 working people in Berlin held a powerful demonstration on the 12th to commemorate the victims under fascist rule. Demonstrators marched through the streets carrying red flags and huge banners. The various terror measures and bans announced by the Western occupying powers in Berlin failed to prevent this grand parade. In Berlin's largest amusement park, a pillar of fire commemorating the anti-fascist martyrs was lit, and the memorial meeting was held here. To commemorate this international memorial day, delegations from the Soviet Union, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary and "Free Greece", "Free Spain", etc. participated. The head of the French delegation, President of the "International Federation of Former Political Prisoners" Lampe, the head of the Soviet delegation, Lieutenant General Gordivil, and the Chairman of the "Association of Those Persecuted by Hitler's Rule in Germany" Geschke (note that Geschke is a member of the Socialist Unity Party and Deputy Speaker of the Berlin City Council) and many other representatives delivered speeches at the meeting. Gordivil said: "We Soviet anti-fascist fighters will not only support the demands of the German people, but also regard the demands of the German people as our own." This large-scale demonstration was also a response to the provocation by the fascists on September 9. On that day, German neo-fascists held an anti-Soviet and anti-people's rally in the western occupied area of Berlin. At the beginning of the meeting, US and British officials were at the forefront, directing everything. The head of the pro-American clique in Berlin, Reuters, the Deputy Mayor of Berlin, Friedensburg, and the head of the reactionary Berlin Social Democratic Party, Numan, openly called for civil war and a war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. After the meeting, the American and French fascist Black Street teams and the newly formed Stormtrooper gangs poured into the Soviet-occupied area, rampaging and provoking, dragging away wounded police officers from the Soviet-occupied area, and firing at the Soviet-occupied area. TASS pointed out that this bloody act of the fascists has aroused deep anger among the people of Berlin. The Berlin Executive Committee of the Socialist Unity Party issued a statement calling on "the working people of Berlin to rise up and remove the weapons from the hands of the fascist provocateurs." The Socialist Unity Party and various democratic groups called on the people of Berlin to participate in the large-scale demonstration on September 12 to respond to the provocations of the fascists. It is also reported that on the 12th, memorial meetings for the victims of fascist rule were held in all cities in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany.

    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社报导：柏林劳动人民四十万人于十二日举行强大示威游行，以纪念在法西斯统治下的受难者。示威者手擎红旗和巨幅标语，通过街头。柏林西占区所宣布要采取的各种恐怖措施和禁令都没有能够阻止这一盛大游行的举行。在柏林最大的乐园广场上，示威者燃起了纪念反法西斯殉难战士的火柱，纪念大会就在这里举行。为纪念这一国际纪念日，苏联、法国、波兰、捷克、挪威、丹麦、奥地利、瑞士、匈牙利等国和“自由希腊”、“自由西班牙”等都有代表团参加，法国代表团团长、“前政治犯国际联合会”主席蓝普、苏代表团团长郭尔迪维尔中将以及“德国遭希特勒统治迫害者协会”主席格什克（按格氏为统一社会党人，任柏林市议会副议长）及其他许多代表等均在大会上发表演说，郭尔迪格尔称：“我们苏联反法西斯战士们，不仅将支持德国人民的要求，而且视德国人民之要求如其自身之要求。”这次大示威，也是回答法西斯分子于九月九日的挑衅。该日，德国新法西斯分子在柏林西部占领区举行反苏反人民大会。大会开始时，美英官方人员即在大会最前列指导一切，柏林亲美集团头子鲁特尔、柏林副市长佛里登斯堡、反动的柏林社会民主党头子努曼等人均在大会上公开号召内战和反苏反人民民主国家的战争。会后，美方法西斯黑街队以及新组成的冲锋队匪帮即涌入苏占区乱冲乱打进行挑衅，拖走苏占区受伤警察，并向苏占区开枪。塔斯社指出，法西斯分子们的此种血腥行为，已激起柏林人民的深沉愤怒。统一社会党柏林执委会发表声明，号召“柏林劳动人民起来搞掉法西斯挑衅者手里的武器”。统一社会党及各民主团体号召柏林人民参加九月十二日的大示威，以回答法西斯分子的挑衅。又悉，十二日，德境苏占区一切城市都举行了纪念法西斯主义统治下受难者的大会。
