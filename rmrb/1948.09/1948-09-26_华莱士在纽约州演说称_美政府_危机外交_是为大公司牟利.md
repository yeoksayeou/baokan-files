Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. TASS, New York, 18th -- Progressive Party presidential candidate Henry Wallace, speaking in Rochester, New York, condemned the State Department and the Truman administration for using "crisis diplomacy" to force the people to accept their war plans, thereby profiting big corporations. He said: The $20 billion military and "foreign aid" budget is a means for trusts to raise prices. This budget is the main source of the $20 billion in profits for major American corporations in 1948. Wallace went on to say that his exchange of letters with Stalin proved that fair negotiations with the Soviet Union are possible, and trade with the Soviet Union is also possible. He said he hoped that the fate of Hitler's army would be a lesson to those anti-Soviet generals.

According to a United Press report, Wallace gave a speech at a mass rally at "American Athletic Field" in New York on the evening of the 10th, declaring that he would vow to fight American fascism to the end of his life. The rally was attended by 48,000 people, the largest number of people at a Progressive Party political gathering. The rally was held to welcome Wallace back from his courageous trip to the South. When Wallace appeared at the venue, the crowd enthusiastically threw confetti at him.

　　华莱士在纽约州演说称
  　美政府“危机外交”是为大公司牟利
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社十八日纽约讯，进步党总统候选人华莱士在纽约州的罗彻斯特演说时，谴责国务院及杜鲁门政府以“危机外交”来强迫人民接受其战争计划，从而为大公司牟利。他说：二百亿美元的军事与“援外”计划预算、就是托辣斯用以提高物价的手段。这笔预算是一九四八年美国各大公司二百亿元利润的最主要来源。华氏继称，斯大林和他的交换信件，证明与苏联的公平谈判是可能的，与苏联贸易也是可能的。他说，他希望希特勒军队的命运将成为那些仇苏的将军们的教训。
    又据合众社电称，华莱士十日晚会在纽约“美国人运动场”群众大会上发表演说，宣称他在有生之日，将誓对美国的法西斯主义作战到底。大会到有听众四万八千人，为进步党政治性集会人数最多的一次。大会的召开系为了欢迎华莱士自南方的勇敢旅行中归来。当华氏出现于会场时，群众曾狂热的向他投掷纸彩。
