Xinhua News Agency, North China, 18th—According to consolidated news from newspapers in Beiping and Tianjin: Students from Northeastern, Shanxi, Henan, and other provinces stranded in Beiping, Hankou, Nanjing, and other places are suffering from extreme mistreatment, deception, and persecution by the Kuomintang government, leading to immense suffering in their lives. Over 1,800 middle school students arriving in Beiping from Taiyuan are housed in the Temple of Heaven and the Imperial Ancestral Temple. Their request to establish a temporary Shanxi middle school has been rejected by the Kuomintang government, and issues such as food, lodging, and education remain unresolved. After Shanxi University students arrived in Beiping, the puppet mayor Liu Yaozhang deceived them, saying, "As long as you can find housing, we will definitely allocate it to you." However, after they found and moved into houses in Diaoyutai near Zhongnanhai, the puppet municipal government immediately sent police to surround the area and order them to evacuate. On August 14th, the students of the university were left starving and trapped. On the 17th, two students were beaten and injured. In addition, several students from the university were beaten by military police on a tram. When they gathered all the students to go to the military police headquarters to demand punishment for the perpetrators, they were surrounded by military police who threatened them with guns. More than 300 Mongolian and Tibetan students arriving in Beiping are all living in the open at the Yonghe Temple. The Mongolian Compatriot Association provides each person with half a catty of millet per day, which is not enough to eat. Henan students stranded in Hankou formed begging teams in mid-August, with five or six dozen people in each team begging along the streets, looking haggard. At the same time, begging groups of Shandong and Henan students also appeared in Nanjing, with thirty to fifty people in each team, each team holding a small flag and begging from shops on the streets. Among them were female students.

Under mistreatment, persecution, and deception, students have actively launched struggles for survival. Shanxi students in Beiping have formed the "Shanxi Students' Association in Beiping," and Mongolian and Tibetan students formed a petition group in mid-August to go to Nanjing to petition for a solution to their living and education problems. Shanxi University students, after being beaten and threatened, said angrily: "All crows are black, Beiping is no better than Taiyuan." More than 300 Henan students stranded in Hankou, after their request to register for accommodation was rejected, angrily smashed the office of the Third Working Team of the Kuomintang Ministry of Education on August 10th. More than 1,700 Henan students surrounded the Nanjing Kuomintang Ministry of Education on the morning of August 10th to petition for a solution to their academic problems and an increase in relief funds. They dispersed in the afternoon under the pressure of military police.

　　流落北平的太原学生
  　食宿无着受饿挨打
    南京出现鲁豫学生乞食团
  　千余学生包围伪教育部请愿
    【新华社华北十八日电】综合平、津报纸消息：流落北平、汉口、南京等地的东北、山西、河南等省份学生，备受国民党政府虐待、欺骗与迫害，生活痛苦万分。由太原抵北平的一千八百余中学生，分住于天坛、太庙内，他们要求成立山西临时中学，已遭国民党政府拒绝，食、宿、学习等问题均无法解决。山西大学学生抵平后，伪市长刘瑶章欺骗他们说：“只要你们能够找到可住的房子，一定拨给你们住”。但当他们找到中南海钓鱼台屋及迁入后，伪市府即派警察前往包围，勒令迁出，八月十四日该校学生在被困中捱饿一天，十七日两人被殴伤。此外，该校学生数人曾在电车上被宪兵殴打，他们集合全体学生赴宪兵队要求惩凶时，又被军警包围，以枪口对准他们加以恫吓。抵平蒙、藏学生已超过三百人，全部露宿在雍和宫，蒙古同乡会每人每日发给半斤小米，无法吃饱。流落汉口的河南学生，八月中旬组成乞食队，每队五、六十人沿街乞讨，容颜憔悴。与此同时，南京亦出现山东、河南学生乞食团，每队三十至五十人不等，各队手持小旗，分向大街上商店行乞，其中还有女学生。
    在虐待、迫害与欺骗下，学生们已积极展开求生存的斗争。北平山西学生已组成“山西流平同学会”，蒙、藏学生八月中旬组成请愿团赴南京请愿，要求解决生活及学习问题。山西大学学生在被殴打及恫吓后愤然说：“天下乌鸦一般黑，北平并不比太原好”。流落汉口的三百余河南学生，在要求登记收容遭拒绝后，于八月十日愤而捣毁国民党教育部第三工作队队部。河南学生一千七百余人，八月十日晨包围南京国民党教育部请愿，要求解决学业问题及增发救济费用，至下午始在军警压迫下散去。
