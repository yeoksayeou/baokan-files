Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 18th: Reports from various sources indicate that the 80th annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress was held in Margate from the 6th to the 10th of this month. It was attended by 850 delegates, representing 188 trade union units affiliated with the British Trades Union Congress. Although these delegates included representatives from progressive unions such as the National Union of Mineworkers and the Electrical Trades Union, most of the delegates could not represent the true interests of the British working masses. The conference was conducted under the control of the right-wing leadership group – the Standing Committee. According to a Reuter's dispatch, before the meeting, the Standing Committee, in close cooperation with Bevin and Cripps, reached a complete agreement with representatives of the major capitalists, deciding to do everything possible to suppress the voices of protest from trade union members at the conference. On September 5th, the Standing Committee of the Trades Union Congress issued a statement expressing support for the government's reactionary wage freeze policy and opposing all methods of controlling profits. Nevertheless, the right-wing leadership group could not suppress the progressive unions from putting forward motions that truly represented the demands of the workers. As a result, the left and right wings engaged in a struggle at the conference, the focus of which was the issue of wages, prices, and profits. Representatives from two powerful unions – the National Union of Mineworkers and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions – proposed a motion to increase wages. They argued that current wages were insufficient to maintain a reasonable standard of living, that the measures taken by the government had failed to prevent wages from falling, and demanded the control of profits and dividends; they advocated that the unions' support for the government should be conditional on reducing prices and limiting profits. Although this wage increase proposal was rejected by a majority of 5.2 million votes at the conference, it received as many as 2.18 million votes in favor. Due to the manipulation of the right-wing leadership group, the conference and its Standing Committee also rejected progressive motions such as "immediately nationalizing the steel industry," "approving the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions and praising its defense of the interests of the working people against monopoly capitalism," and "proposing a new meeting between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to restore wartime unity." In addition, because the right-wing leadership group was intimidated by the growing dissatisfaction of the working masses with high prices, and because the passage of certain particularly reactionary motions would excessively expose their true colors, the conference passed a motion calling on the government to "more effectively control prices" and rejected a motion "requesting the British government to remove communist officials." The conference also unanimously passed a resolution "demanding a sharp increase in Anglo-Soviet trade relations." On the closing day, the conference elected Will Lawther as Chairman of the Standing Committee to replace Hancock.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 18th: TASS, Moscow, September 13th: A Pravda observer wrote that the British Trades Union Congress held in Margate well demonstrates the characteristics of the current policies of the Labour Party and, generally speaking, right-wing socialist parties. The conference announced policies that were completely adapted to the demands of monopoly capital and openly opposed to the interests of the working people on all issues before it. The Margate conference promoted the "Marshall Plan," by which American capitalists enslave Western Europe. At the same time, the heads of the conference created an atmosphere of frenzied slander against progressive representatives of the British and international working-class movement, and spread rumors attacking the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Soviet trade unions. The article pointed out that after the trade union leaders adopted policies that completely violated the demands of British workers, they said: The question is whether the trade union leaders can force British workers to agree to these policies. This question seriously troubles the British ruling group. The voting at the Margate conference does not reflect the mood of the working masses at all. This is manifested in the widespread spontaneous strikes that disregard leadership and the election of new figures with progressive tendencies to leading positions in trade unions. In Britain, as in other Western European countries, the gap between the working masses and the right-wing socialist leadership organs that have openly sided with big business is widening.

　　英职工大会举行年会
    会上表现右派社会党完全适应独占资本的要求，公然反对劳动人民利益。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】各方报导：英国职工大会第八十届年会，于本月六日至十日在马盖特举行，到会代表八百五十人，代表英国总工会所属之一百八十八个工会单位，这些代表中虽然包括进步工会如全国矿工联盟、电气工业工会等的代表，但大部分代表是不能代表英国工人群众的真正利益的。大会在右翼领导集团——常委会的操纵之下进行。据电通社消息称，在会前，常委会在贝文与克利浦斯的密切合作下，与大资本家的代表达成了完全的协议，决定尽一切办法压制职工会会员在大会中抗议的呼声。九月五日，总工会常委会发表声明，表示支持政府反动的冻结工资政策，并反对一切管制利润的办法。然而，尽管如此，右翼领导集团仍不能压制进步工会提出真正代表工人要求的动议。因之，左右两翼在大会上展开了斗争，其焦点为工资、物价与利润问题。两个强有力的工会——全国矿工联盟与造船工人工会的代表在会上提出增加工资的议案。他们认为目前的工资不足以维持合理的生活标准，政府所采的措施，未能阻止工资的下降；要求管制利润和红利；主张工会对政府的支持，应以减低物价和限制利润为条件。这一增资提案虽为大会五百二十万票的反对票所否决，但赞成的有二百十八万票之多。由于右翼领导集团的操纵，大会及其常委会并否决了“立即使钢铁工业国有化”、“批准世界工联活动并赞扬其保卫劳动人民利益反对垄断资本主义”以及“建议英美苏举行新会议以恢复战时团结”等进步议案。除此之外，由于右翼领导集团慑于工人群众对物价高涨的日益不满和某些特别反动的议案的通过将会过份地暴露他们的真面目，大会通过一项要求政府“更有效地管制物价”的议案，并否决一项“要求英政府清除共产党官员”的动议。大会并一致通过了一项“要求急剧增加英苏贸易关系”的决议。在闭幕日，大会选举了威尔·劳瑟为常委会主席以代替汉考克。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：真理报观察家著文称：在马盖特举行的英国职工大会，很能表现工党以及一般说来右派社会党目前政策的特点。大会对于摆在它面前的一切问题，都宣布了完全适应独占资本要求并公然反对劳动人民利益的政策。马盖特大会宣扬美国资本家奴役西欧的“马歇尔计划”，同时，大会的头子们制造了疯狂污蔑英国和国际工人阶级运动进步代表的情势以及造谣攻击世界工联和苏联职工会的气氛。该文指出工会领袖们采取了完全违反英国工人要求的政策之后称：问题在于工会领袖是否能够迫使英国工人同意这种政策。这一问题严重地苦恼着英国统治集团。马盖特大会上的投票，最不能反映工人群众的心境。这表现在蔑视领导而在各处爆发的很多自发的罢工以及选举具有进步倾向的新人物担任工会领导职务。在英国，象在其他西欧各国一样，工人群众与公然投靠大企业的右派社会党领导机关之间的鸿沟是正在加深着。
