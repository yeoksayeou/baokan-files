Northern Yue Administrative Office Instruction
	Villages Along Rivers Release Silt for Fertilizer
[Northern Yue Telegram] The Northern Yue Administrative Office issued instructions for increasing fertilizer after the autumn harvest to increase fertilizer. (1) Prepare to carry out silt release work in a planned manner. Decaying plants and animals, scattered manure and urine, and weathered dust from mountains, fields, streets, and courtyards are all high-quality and abundant fertilizers. After being washed away by rainwater, they can be collected to irrigate fields and silt land, replacing fertilizer. The abundance of products on both sides of the Hutuo River in Pingshan and the Sanggan River in Zhuolu is due to silt release. Any river ditch or village can release silt after a rainstorm. It is necessary to carry out silt release work practically and extensively to increase fertilizer and reduce flood damage. Large-scale silt release projects, which are difficult for one county to overcome, will be built by the administrative office or special commissioner's office according to their own strength and technology. Medium-sized silt release projects, which can be organized by one county, will be built by the county and district governments according to their own strength and technology. Small-scale silt release projects, which can be organized by one or several villages, will be built by the villagers according to their own strength and technology. After each rain, the dirty water from ditches and canals in each village can also be used to silt the land. After the autumn harvest, cadres in each county, district, and village should investigate the terrain and water potential, predetermine the size of silt release projects that should be repaired and can be repaired this year, plan labor and funds, and strive to start construction as soon as possible. (2) Call on the masses to raise pigs and sheep, collect manure and pad pens to increase fertilizer. The work of grazing and lying down for sheep flocks should be well organized according to the principle of mutual benefit for both labor and capital. In addition, mobilize the masses to smoke fertilizer and exchange kangs, especially in areas with abundant firewood (such as western Pingxi), where firewood far from the village should be smoked on the spot after the autumn harvest to increase fertilizer. (3) Reward the opening of oil mills and flour mills to produce a large amount of fertilizer. Flour mills and oil mills that have been suspended due to land reform or other reasons should quickly correct deviations and actively support them to restore development, increase production, and increase fertilizer. (4) To achieve the above objectives, cadres working in rural areas should carry out extensive publicity to the masses, lead the masses to increase fertilizer according to the actual situation in each region, overcome the bureaucratic style of empty talk about increasing fertilizer in the past, and lay the groundwork for applying fertilizer and enriching fields to increase income next year.

　　北岳行署指示
  　沿河村庄放淤积肥
    【北岳电】北岳行政公署为增加肥料，特指示秋后增肥工作。（一）有计划的准备进行放淤工作。山上、地上、街里、院里不断有腐烂的动植物，抛撒的粪尿，风化的尘土，这是质量很好数量极大的肥料，经过雨水冲刷，集中起来可以灌田淤地，代替肥料。平山的滹沱河两岸，涿鹿的桑乾河两岸，所以物产丰富，都得力于放淤。随便那个河沟，那个村庄，雨后的洪水都可以放淤。必须切实而广泛的进行放淤工作，以增加肥料，减少水患。大的放淤工程，一县克服困难，由行署或专署根据本身的力量技术进行兴修。中等放淤工程，一县所能举办的，由县区政府根据本身的力量技术进行兴修。小的放淤工程一村或几村所能举办的，由村民根据本身的力量技术进行兴修。每次下雨后，各村一沟一渠的脏水也可淤地。各县区村干部，应于秋后调查地形水势，预定今年应修而且能修的大小放淤工程、筹划劳力资金，争取早日动手举办。（二）号召群众养猪养羊，拾粪垫圈，以增加肥料。关于羊群的放牧卧地工作，要根据劳资两利的原则好好组织。另外发动群众薰肥换炕，特别是柴草多的地区（如平西），应将离村过远的柴草，于秋后就地薰粪增加肥料。（三）奖励开设油房粉房，大量制造肥料。因土地改革或其他原因而停顿的粉房、油房，均应迅速纠正偏向，积极予以扶助，使其恢复发展，增加生产，增加肥料。（四）为达以上目的，在农村工作的干部，应向群众进行广泛宣传，根据各地区实际情况，领导群众进行增肥，克服以往空喊增肥的官僚主义作风，打下明年上粪肥田增收的准备工作。
