[Taihang Telegraph] The Lincheng Fangnao Village Cooperative, which organizes villagers' production according to seasonal changes and mass needs and is growing stronger, was recognized as a model cooperative in the county at the recent county-wide meeting to rectify cooperatives. The village is a remote and scattered small village, far from the market town, making it very inconvenient for the masses to purchase daily necessities, and the sale of local products is also quite difficult. Therefore, the cooperative has a mixed business of production and consumption, and has achieved great results in organizing mass production over the past year. Last July, it organized the villagers to beat a total of 19,000 catties of black leaves in eight days, and transported 7,000 catties to Loudi, earning a total profit of 456,000 yuan. It cooperated with the Shangweisi Village Cooperative to boil 2,200 catties of black leaf paste, earning a profit of 2.96 million yuan. After deducting expenses, the two village cooperatives divided it equally, each receiving a net profit of 1.05 million yuan. During the paste boiling, the cooperative also organized the masses to collect 86,000 catties of firewood, earning 6 yuan per catty, for a profit of 516,000 yuan. The masses and the cooperative both made money, and the difficulty of dye supply was also solved. Last winter, it organized the masses to pick 1,600 catties of oak valleys, earning a profit of 197,000 yuan. This spring, in order to overcome the spring famine, the cooperative led a 100-day textile movement, responsible for supplying raw materials and tools, buying a total of 280 catties of cotton, manufacturing six looms and twelve spinning wheels for the masses, and newly cultivating six weaving women and seven spinning women. The number of households in the village who do not buy cloth to wear has reached 30% of the village (in the past, the area did not know how to spin and weave), overcoming the spring famine. When apricot kernels came down, it purchased apricot kernels and organized elementary school students to pick three stones and two dou of apricot kernels, 400 yuan per dou, and the students earned a profit of 12,800 yuan, solving the difficulty of stationery. After weeding the fields, when there was no work to do due to drought, the cooperative seized the gap to organize the masses to dig medicinal materials, and the cooperative was responsible for selling them. The masses earned a total profit of 190,000 yuan. During the rush planting after the rain, it also organized the remaining labor of mutual aid groups to raise 5,600 pieces of stone slabs, earning 280,000 yuan in silver dollars. In order to support the masses in raising silkworms, the cooperative purchased silk and organized workers to make 110 catties of silk. The cooperative earned 700,000 yuan in silver dollars, exchanging a large amount of textile raw materials. Under the correct business direction, the cooperative's business is expanding day by day. When it was established in 1939, the share capital was only over 1,000 yuan, which was a small grocery store, opening its doors every five days, specializing in supplying the masses with daily necessities. After rent reduction in 1942, the share capital expanded to 4,000 yuan, and the cooperative was formally formed, leading the masses to overcome disasters. At that time, the profit from textile was great, but no one in the village knew how to spin and weave. The cooperative, on the one hand, used the calculation of interests to mobilize the masses, and on the other hand, organized outsiders to teach techniques. The village cooperative was responsible for supplying raw materials and selling finished products. At that time, although the scale of textile in the whole village was very small, it played a great role in helping the masses to overcome disasters, and the masses supported it very much. Each time the dividends are distributed, the dividends are reinvested as shares. Up to now, the share capital has expanded to 3.3 million yuan, and there is a pharmacy. All 119 households in the village have shares. The three cadres in the cooperative, in addition to the cooperative providing food and clothing, the production difficulties in their homes are solved by the masses helping with work, and the cooperative pays wages to solve them. The reason why the cooperative can guarantee the regular correctness of its business is that the cooperative has established a sound democratic system, and consults with the masses in case of trouble. Members hold meetings every half month to reflect the opinions of the masses on the cooperative to the supervisory committee. According to the opinions of the masses, the board of directors inspects the work of the village cooperative once a month to determine the work for the next month. Recently, the cooperative has set out a plan for the coming year: to breed 30 cattle and donkeys, to achieve that the whole village does not buy cloth to wear through textile, to develop from the existing 270 sheep to 1,000, to solve the fertilizer problem in the whole village, to plant 180 mulberry trees, and to develop silkworm rearing.

　　按季节变化和群众需要
  　随时注意组织生产
  　方垴合作社当了模范
    【太行电】按季节变化和群众需要组织村民生产，日益发展壮大的临城方垴村合作社，在此次全县整顿合作社会议上，被公认为全县模范合作社。该村是一偏僻分散的小村，离集镇很远，群众购买日用必需品很不方便，土产销售亦颇为困难，因此该社是生产与消费的混合业务，一年来组织群众生产，得到很大成绩。去年七月组织全村群众在八日内共打黑叶一万九千斤，往楼底运输了七千斤，共得利四十五万六千元。与上围寺村社合熬黑叶膏二千二百斤，获利二百九十六万元。除花费外，两村社对半分，各得净利一百零五万元。熬膏中，该社并组织群众打柴八万六千斤，每斤六元，得利五十一万六千元。群众、社里都赚了钱，又解决了染料困难。去年冬季组织群众拾橡谷一千六百斤，得利十九万七千元。今春为渡过春荒，该社领导开展百日纺织运动，负责供给原料和工具，共买棉花二百八十斤，给群众制造织布机六张，纺车十二架，新培养了织妇六个，纺妇七个。全村不买布穿的户数已达全村百分之三十（过去该地不会纺织）战胜了春荒。杏核下来时，收买杏仁，组织小学生拾杏核三石二斗，每斗四百元，学生得利一万二千八百元，解决了文具困难。锄完地后，天旱没活做，该社抓紧空隙组织群众刨药材，社里负责出售，群众共得利十九万元。雨后抢种中，又组织互助组剩余劳力起石板五千六百块，赚洋二十八万元。为扶植群众养蚕，合作社收买蚕丝，组织工人打丝一百一十斤，合作社赚洋七十万元，大量换回纺织原料。在正确的业务方向下，该社营业日益扩大。一九三九年成立时股金只有一千余元，是一小杂货铺，五天一开门，专门供给群众日用必需品。四二年经过减租，股金扩大到四千元，合作社正式形成，即领导群众渡灾荒。当时纺织利大，但该村没一个人会纺织。合作社一面用计算利益发动群众，一面组织外来户传授技术，村社负责供给原料，推销成品。当时全村纺织规模虽然很小，但帮助群众渡过灾荒的作用颇大，群众非常拥护。每次分红，均将红利再作股入进，到现在止，股金已扩大到三百三十万元，并有药铺一座，全村一百一十九户，家家入股。社里三个干部，除社供给吃穿外，家中生产困难由群众帮工，社里出工资解决。该社所以能保证营业的经常正确，是社里建立了一种优良的民主制度，遇事和群众商量。社员半月开会一次，向监事会反映群众对合作社意见。理事会根据群众意见，一月一次检查村社工作，确定下月工作。最近该社定出今后一年计划：繁殖牲口牛驴三十头，纺织作到全村不买布穿，从现有二百七十只羊发展到一千只，解决全村肥料问题，栽桑树一百八十棵，发展养蚕。
