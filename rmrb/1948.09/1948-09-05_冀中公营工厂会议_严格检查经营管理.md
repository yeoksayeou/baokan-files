Jizhong Electric: To implement the spirit of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, the Jizhong Industrial Company convened a conference of public factory directors and managers on July 28, lasting for 25 days. At the meeting, based on the resolutions of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, the serious blind waste, bureaucratization, complacency, and bureaucratic work style in the current management of public factories were severely criticized. Everyone agreed that the past management of factories followed the traditional supply system, with a strong handicraft, workshop, and bureaucratic housekeeping style. Although it was mentioned in the past that the capitalist management methods that should be criticized and accepted, they were actually rejected. All factories conducted in-depth self-criticisms at the meeting. The leaders of the Industrial Company blindly rushed ahead without investigation, and without calculating costs, they established two alkali plants, resulting in the expenditure of 10 to 20 million yuan without achieving much. There was a bureaucratic work style in the leadership, with more arrangements and less inspection, and the work was not thorough. Other factories also identified many serious errors in business management. Many factories only focused on quantity, failing to grasp the key points, aiming too high, and acting blindly. There was no plan in business management, and manpower and materials were seriously wasted. One factory often had surplus funds of 15 million yuan in the bank. Another factory often had 4 to 5 million yuan of unnecessary surplus funds. In one factory, formal production personnel accounted for only 58 percent of all employees, with the remaining 40 percent or more engaged in odd jobs. One factory produced an average of only two hours per day. One factory did not calculate costs for one year and three months, and the pricing of its products was inappropriate, resulting in a loss. These were inseparable from the bureaucratic work style in business management. Some factories had a tailism tendency in leadership, and dared not boldly manage and educate workers; some only emphasized the mass line, resulting in accommodation, and even wages were determined by the workers themselves. Some looked down on technical workers, feeling that technical workers were "backward," and did not actively carry out education. In some factories, workers even replaced the factory director in managing the factory. The meeting also examined the phenomena of disorganization, lack of discipline, and non-implementation of resolutions in public factories: After the Jizhong March Industry and Commerce Conference, one factory did not implement the resolutions, and two managers quarreled, affecting production. Some factories resisted the leadership and did not implement instructions, resulting in a large number of bricks being burned but unable to be sold.

After a thorough review, Luo Yushan, Director of the Jizhong Administrative Office, pointed out: "There is still a phenomenon of inconsistency between the Jizhong public factories and the Industrial Company. The main reason is the existence of a bureaucratic housekeeping style, the emergence of the idea of independent producers, and the phenomena of disorganization and lack of discipline. This is the biggest obstacle to the development of state-owned factories and should be resolutely overcome."

At the meeting, the draft economic discipline of North China and the draft business management, as well as the future direction and tasks, were discussed in detail. The general thinking on the current industrial production direction and tasks has begun to be clarified. The leather factory has planned to develop in the direction of tire specialization, and abolish white leather and nitric leather. The chemical factory decided to abolish the manufacture of batteries and bleaching powder, strengthen the manufacture of malodorous alkali, and study and experiment with alkali noodles. The idea of enterprise management has also been further clarified. Everyone is determined to correct the shortcomings of making false plans in the past, resolutely streamline unnecessary personnel, increase production, and improve quality. Overcome bureaucracy and serious waste, as well as shortcomings and errors such as disorganization and lack of discipline, strengthen management work, and complete production tasks.

　　冀中公营工厂会议
  　严格检查经营管理
    【冀中电】冀中实业公司为贯彻华北工商会议的精神，于七月二十八日召开公营工厂厂长、经理会议。先后历时二十五天。会上根据华北工商会议的决议，严格批判了当前公营工厂管理工作中严重的盲目浪费、机关化、自满情绪和官僚主义作风。大家一致认为过去管理工厂是供给制的传统，有浓厚的手工业、作坊和机关家务的作风。虽然过去曾提到应批判的接受资本主义的管理方法，但实际上是拒绝接受。各个工厂在会议上都进行了深刻的检讨。实业公司领导上盲目蛮干，没调查、没计算成本就建立了两个碱厂，结果花费了一、二千万元，没有得到什么成绩。领导上存在着官僚主义作风，布置多而检查少，工作不深入。其他各厂也检查出经营管理上很多严重错误。不少工厂只图多，抓不住重点，好高鹜远，盲目乱干。在经营管理上没有计划，人力物力严重浪费。某工厂经常有多余资金一万五千万元存在银行。某工厂经常有四、五千万元不必要的余款。某工厂正式生产人员仅占全体职工的百分之五十八，其余百分之四十多都作了杂工。某工厂每天平均只生产两小时。某工厂在一年零三个月中，没计算成本，出品定价不当，结果赔了钱。这些都和经营管理上的官僚主义分不开。有的工厂在领导上存在着尾巴主义，不敢大胆管理教育工人，有的只强调走群众路线，结果形成迁就，甚至工资也叫工人自订。有的看不起技术工人，觉着技术工人“落后”，又不积极进行教育。有的工厂工人竟代替厂长管理了工厂。会议对公营工厂里的无组织无纪律和不执行决议等现象也作了检查：某工厂在冀中三月工商会议以后，不执行决议，两个经理闹分家，影响了生产。有的工厂和领导对抗，不执行指示，结果烧出大批砖卖不出去。
    经过深刻检讨后，冀中行署罗玉山主任指出：“冀中公营工厂和实业公司，还有上下不一气的现象，主要原因是存在着机关家务的作风，产生了独立生产者的思想，和无组织无纪律现象。这是发展国营工厂的最大障碍，应该坚决克服。”
    会上对华北经济纪律草案及经营管理草案，和今后方针、任务都作了详细的讨论。对于当前工业生产的方针任务，大的思想上已开始明确。皮革厂已计划向轮带专业化方向发展，取消白皮硝皮。化学厂决定取消制装电池、漂白粉，加强制造臭碱，并研究试验碱面。在企业化思想上，也进一步明确了。大家决心纠正过去订假计划等缺点，坚决精简不必要的人员，增加生产，提高质量。克服官僚主义及严重浪费与无组织无纪律等缺点与错误，加强管理工作，完成生产任务。
