　　Military Families Encourage Sons to Perform Meritorious Service
  　Taihang Fourth Military Subdistrict Troops Further Consolidated
    [Taihang Electric Dispatch] The Fourth Military Subdistrict troops, in conjunction with local governments and the masses, have been using military families' encouragement of their relatives to reassure them in killing the enemy, which has played a significant role in consolidating and educating the troops. Because the government and the masses have taken good care of military families, and coupled with continuous explanations of the nationwide victory situation, the military families' awareness has been raised. When they visit their relatives in the troops, they directly carry out consolidation work with the soldiers. Dong Chunming, a soldier in the Fifth Company of a certain unit, was always thinking about his wife and not focusing on his work. After his wife found out, she went to see him and encouraged him, saying, "I am an activist at home, serving as the chairman of the village women's rescue association, and I have also performed meritorious service. You must work hard and perform great meritorious service in the army, so that our family will be glorious!" These words touched Chunming's heart and greatly boosted his enthusiasm for killing the enemy. Jiao Boying's soldier, Jiang Wansheng's old mother, educated her son, saying, "You joined the Liberation Army of your own accord, so you must work hard. The family is much better off than before! It will be even better when Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown." Now Jiang Wansheng has become an activist in the troops. During the military families' persuasion campaign, the Fifth Company of a certain unit specially convened a meeting of military family members who came to visit their relatives, warmly received them, and Zhang Baohai's mother said, "We must make them feel at ease!" After the discussion, the idea of dragging the troops back was overcome in some military families, which played a role in consolidating the troops. Wang Fayi's mother, a soldier in the Xiu Huowu camp, after educating her son, also reported to the troops her son's plan to organize the eight brothers to desert, which consolidated the troops.

　　军属劝勉子弟立功
  　太行四分区部队更加巩固
    【太行电】四分区部队与地方政府及群众相互结合，以军属劝勉亲人安心杀敌，对巩固教育部队起作用很大。由于政府与群众很好的照顾军属，再加以向他们不断讲解全国胜利形势，军属觉悟提高，当他们到部队看望亲人时，便对战士直接的进行了巩固工作。某部五连战士董春明，每天光想老婆不安心工作，他老婆知道后就去看他，劝他说：“我在家是积极分子，担任村妇救会主席，还立了功，你在部队上也要好好干，立大功，咱家才光荣哩！”这些话打动春明的心，大大鼓起了他的杀敌劲头。焦博营战士姜万胜的老母亲教育他儿子说：“当解放军是咱自己当的，你要好好干，家里比过去强多啦！打倒蒋介石就更好了。”现姜万胜已成为部队中的积极分子。在军属们劝说运动中，某部五连特召开了看望亲人的军属会，热忱招待，战士张保孩的母亲说：“咱们要叫他们安心干！”经过座谈，克服了部分军属们的拉后腿思想，对巩固部队起作用很大。修获武营战士王法义母亲，在她教育了自己儿子后，并向部队上揭发了她儿子组织八大弟兄逃亡的打算，使部队得到巩固。
