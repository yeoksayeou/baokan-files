　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th -- Reports from various sources: The Paris meeting of representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France concluded on the 15th without reaching any agreement. The issue of the former Italian colonies has been decided to be submitted to the third United Nations General Assembly, which will open on September 21st, for resolution. Under the general principle of maintaining military bases on the Mediterranean coast, U.S. imperialism proposed a so-called proposal to the representative meeting, advocating that Cyrenaica (a part of Libya) be handed over to British "trusteeship" and Somaliland be "returned" to Italy. Agence France-Presse revealed that the U.S. proposal was formulated by the U.S.-British Joint Chiefs of Staff, with the aim of maintaining the so-called anti-Soviet "Mediterranean balance." At the meeting on the 14th, Soviet representative Vyshinsky revealed that the United States and Britain, disregarding the interests of peace, had already expanded wartime American bases in Libya. Based on the principles of considering the wishes and welfare of the residents of the colonies and the security of peace (the Four-Power Joint Declaration in the Italian Peace Treaty), Vyshinsky proposed the Soviet proposal, advocating that Italian colonies be left to Italian representatives to be managed by the United Nations under the condition that democratic governments composed of representatives of local residents could be established in the colonies. This proposal was rejected by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France. In order to reach a compromise agreement, Vyshinsky put forward another new proposal, advocating that Libya be allowed to become independent after ten years. The management issues during these ten years would be handled in accordance with the United Nations trusteeship agreement, and the establishment of a democratic government organized by local residents would be guaranteed. The remaining two Italian colonies would also be handled in essentially the same way. Vyshinsky pointed out that the Soviet proposal actually followed the American plan put forward by former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes on September 13, 1945, but it was still unreasonably rejected by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France, and the meeting failed to make any decision. Note: There are three former Italian colonies, all in Africa, and their strategic positions are very important. The first is Libya, on the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, with an area of ​​more than 600,000 square miles and a population of 880,000. Its eastern part is called Cyrenaica, and its western part is called Tripolitania; the second is Italian Eritrea, on the west coast of the Red Sea, with an area of ​​15,000 square miles and a population of 600,000; the third is Italian Somaliland, on the west coast of the Indian Ocean, with an area of ​​190,000 square miles and a population of 1.3 million.

　　美帝图据有地中海岸军事基地
  　四强代表会未获协议
    【新华社陕北二十日电】各方报导：苏、美、英、法四国巴黎代表会议已于十五日闭幕，未获任何协议，前意大利殖民地问题已决定提交九月二十一日开幕的第三届联合国大会解决。美帝国主义在保持地中海沿岸军事基地的总方针下，这次曾向代表会议提出所谓建议案，主张将昔兰尼加（利比亚的一部分）交给英国“托管”，将索马利兰“交还”意大利。法新社透露，美国建议案是由美英联合参谋部制订的，目的是在保持所谓反苏的“地中海均势”。在十四日的会议上，苏代表维辛斯基揭露美英两国不顾和平的利益，早已在利比亚扩大战时的美国基地。根据应考虑各殖民地居民愿望与福利及和平安全的原则（对意和约中四强联合宣言），维辛斯基提出苏联的建议，主张能在各殖民地建立由当地居民代表组成民主政府的条件下，将意大利各殖民地留交意大利代表联合国托管。此一建议遭到美英法代表的拒绝。为了能够达到一项折衷协定，维辛斯基又提出另一新建议，主张允许利比亚在十年以后独立，在此十年期间的管理问题，则按照联合国托管协议处理，并保证建立由本地居民组织的民主政府。意大利其余二殖民地，也大体上按这一办法处理。维辛斯基提出，苏联这一建议案实际上是沿用前美国国务卿贝纳斯在一九四五年九月十三日所提出来的美国方案，但仍然遭到美英法代表的无理拒绝，并使会议未作出任何决定。按：前意大利殖民地共有三处，都在非洲，战略地位都很重要。其一为利比亚，在地中海南岸，面积六十余万方哩，人口八十八万，其东部称为昔兰尼加，西部称为的黎波里坦尼亚；其二为意属厄立特里亚，在红海西岸，面积一万五千方哩，人口六十万；其三为意属索马利兰，在印度洋西岸，面积十九万方哩，人口一百三十万。
