　　【North Yue Telegram】Fangshan's Third and Sixth Districts are semi-guerrilla areas, close to the enemy strongholds of Huayuan, Zhuoxian, and Changgou. At present, the autumn harvest is underway, and the enemy is constantly attacking. In order to protect the autumn harvest, the Third and Sixth Districts convened village cadre meetings on the 6th of this month to convey the county committee's autumn protection plan, requiring all villages to harvest one piece of ripe crops, cultivate one piece, and plant one piece, and quickly fortify the harvested grain. Militia joint defense was established at the meeting. After the meeting, village cadres returned to their villages and convened villagers' meetings to mobilize and deploy, and everyone took urgent action. It is estimated that the autumn harvest work in the Sixth District will be completed in another three days.

　　房山边地加紧收种
    【北岳电】房山三、六区是半游击区，靠敌据点花园、涿县、长沟很近。目前秋收已到，敌人不断进攻。为了保秋，三、六区于本月六日均召开了村干会议，传达县委护秋计划，要求各村做到熟一片收一片耕一片种一片，打下粮食快坚壁。并在大会上成立了民兵联防。会后各村干部回村，都召开了村民大会做了动员布置，大家紧急行动起来。六区秋收工作估计再有三天即可全部完成。
