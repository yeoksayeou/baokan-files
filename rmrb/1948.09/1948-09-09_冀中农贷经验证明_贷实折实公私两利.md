The Experience of Agricultural Loans in Central Hebei Proves That Loans are Real and Accounted for, Benefiting Both the Public and Private Sectors
[Central Hebei News] In the past, the issuance of agricultural loans in Central Hebei carried a serious "gift-giving" and relief perspective. The understanding of using loans to support production was vague. As a result, loans could not play their due role, and bank loan funds suffered losses year after year. It was also difficult to ensure that the masses could buy certain means of production, or the price stability was often affected due to everyone rushing to purchase at the same time. To make agricultural loans truly benefit both the public and private sectors, both maintaining the state's capital from being lost and achieving the long-term goal of supporting the masses in developing production, it is necessary to overcome the "gift-giving" and relief perspective and strictly separate production loans from relief. During the trial implementation of "loans being real and accounted for" in May and June, many people realized that "loans being real and accounted for" benefited both the public and private sectors, and price fluctuations had no impact after accounting for the real value. The masses in Shenze County, Ninth District, reflected: "This method is good. Farmers rely on what comes out of the land. If it weren't for this (referring to loans being real and accounted for), the price of grain would drop after the autumn harvest, and we couldn't bear it." Guo Jinian and Zhang Fushan from Nanmazhuang, Ningjin, who borrowed money for waterwheels, said: "Grain is so expensive now. If it isn't converted into grain, the grain price will fall after the autumn harvest, and we might not be able to repay it. Now that we have converted it into grain, we are not afraid." Of course, in the early stage of converting to real value, due to insufficient publicity and imperfections in specific practices, some people still had concerns about converting to real value. In Beikanwei Village, Gaoyang, because the cadres did not have enough understanding of converting to real value and did not explain it well to the masses, the masses did not understand the idea and were afraid of suffering losses if the grain price rose in the future. Feng Ming from Dongsan Village, Third District, Shenze, had a strong desire to buy a waterwheel. When it was decided to lend him one million yuan (equivalent to 1,700 catties of rice), he calculated that all the grain produced on his eleven mu of irrigated land would have to be used, leaving his family with no grain to eat. He refused to buy the waterwheel, but after the cadres explained that he could borrow in large amounts and repay in small installments, he dared to borrow the money. Some specific practices of converting to real value were not well-considered, making it difficult for the masses to accept. For example, the real value conversion price in Lixian was divorced from the market, and the masses were unwilling to convert. The grain price in Xinle Third District differed from the city price by 5,000 yuan per dou, and the masses stopped converting. The solution to this problem is to convert according to the average transaction price of the central market at that time and place, and the masses are willing to convert. The deadline stipulated in some areas was inappropriate, so the masses were not easily accepted. The vice-industry loan in Beihao Village, Anping, was converted to real value with a three-month deadline. The masses said: "Returning it in three months is exactly when the harvest is lean and rice is expensive, we will not convert to rice." They preferred to return it after the autumn harvest. From the practice of loans being real and accounted for, it has been tested that loans being real are easier for the masses to accept than loans being accounted for, especially for short-term sideline loans. The masses are not only difficult to accept, but also extend the borrowing period, making it difficult to achieve continuous circulation. For example, the masses in Zhuanghe Village, Jin County, suggested: "Didn't you used to exchange cotton for cloth? This method is good, why don't you do it this way?" Therefore, it is necessary to combine the two methods of loan conversion and loan actuals. This is very necessary. This spring, various regions held loans in real and accountable forms, roughly divided into three forms. One is that the production promotion agency (or bank) directly manufactures and purchases and transports production materials to supply the masses. The second is lending grain and returning grain. The third is to issue loans from organizing the masses to combine private capital and collectively purchase production materials to make up for their insufficient parts. Through these various forms of loans in kind, it has been proven that loans in kind not only overcome phenomena such as embezzlement, waste, and fraudulently obtaining loans under false names, but more importantly, loans in kind solve the masses’ procurement difficulties, save expenses, avoid stimulating prices, and ensure that all loans are used for development. production. In the future, if we can achieve a planned and close combination of loans in kind, conversion, and warehouse management. Timely solving the difficulties encountered by the masses after loans are actually made, and immediately purchasing the necessary means of production, will be even more supported by the masses. Moreover, on the basis of mutual benefit for the public and private sectors and developing production, not only can the agricultural loan funds of the National Bank be fully maintained, but they can even be strengthened. Furthermore, issuing agricultural loans can truly and effectively achieve the goal of developing production.

### 冀中农贷经验证明　贷实折实公私两利

　　冀中农贷经验证明
  　贷实折实公私两利
    【冀中讯】冀中过去的农贷发放，都带着严重的恩赐帐济观点，对贷款用于扶植生产的认识是模糊的。因之贷款不能发挥其应有作用，且造成银行贷款资金年年亏损，又难保证群众买到一定的生产资料，或常因一齐下手争购，影响了物价稳定。要使农贷真正作到公私两利，既能保持国家资本不受损失，又能达到长期扶植群众发展生产之目的，必须克服恩赐赈济观点，使生产贷款与救济严格分开。五、六两个月试行贷实折实中，不少群众都认识到贷实折实是公私两利的，折实后物价涨落都无影响。九分区深泽县群众反映：“这个办法好，庄稼人就是地里出粮食的一着，不那么着（指贷实折实），秋后粮一抽价，可受不了。”宁晋南马庄贷水车的郭尽念、张夫山说：“这时粮食这样贵，如不折成粮食，秋后粮价落了，说还不起就还不起，现在折起粮食来，咱们就不怕了。”当然在折实初期，由于宣传不深入和具体作法上不够完善，因此部分群众对折实还存在着顾虑。高阳北看苇村，因干部对折实认识不够，未向群众进行很好解释，所以群众思想不通，怕将来粮涨了，折实吃亏。深泽三区东三村冯名要求买水车的劲头很大，当决定贷给他一百万元（折米一千七百斤），他算着十一亩水地产粮都得用了，一家无吃粮，说什么也不买水车了，后经干部解释可以整借零还，才敢贷下来。由于某些折实的具体作法上考虑不周，也使群众不易接受，如蠡县折实价格脱离了市场，群众不愿折。新乐三区与城里粮价每斗相差五千元，群众不折了。解决这个问题的办法是：按当时当地中心集市的中等成交价格来折合，群众才愿意了。在期限上某些地区规定不适当，所以群众也不易接受。安平北郝村副业贷款折实限期三个月。群众说：“三个月归还，正是青黄不接米贵的时候，俺不折米。”而愿过秋归还。从贷款折实贷实中，考验到贷款折实不如贷实群众易接受，特别是短期的副业贷款，群众不仅不易接受，而且会使借款时期延长，很难作到川流不息。如晋县庄合寨群众提议：“你们过去不是以棉换布吗？这个办法好，何以不这样作。”因此贷款折实与贷实两种作法应结合起来，是很必要的。今春各地举办贷实折实，大致分为三种形式，一种是生产推进社（或银行）直接制造购运生产资料，供给群众。二是贷粮还粮。三是从组织群众结合私资集体采购生产资料中发放贷款，以补足其不足部分。在通过这些各种贷实形式中，均已证明贷实不仅克服了挪用浪费、冒名骗取贷款等现象，更重要的是贷实解决了群众的采购困难，节省开支，与避免剌激物价，保证了全部贷款用于发展生产。今后我们如能作到贷实、折实、仓库保管三者有计划的密切结合起来。及时解决群众贷实后的出现困难，与立即购得必需的生产资料，就更为群众拥护。且在公私两利发展生产的基础上，则国家银行的农贷资金，不仅可以完全保持，甚至可以壮大，再则发放农贷也真正有效的达到发展生产之目的。
