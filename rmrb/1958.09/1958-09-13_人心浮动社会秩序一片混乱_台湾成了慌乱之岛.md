    Public Panic and Social Order in Chaos
    Taiwan Becomes an Island of Panic
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th – The tense situation created by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique has turned Taiwan into an island of panic.
    Currently, social order in Taiwan is in complete chaos. Especially in major cities such as Taichung, Tainan, and Taipei, the people are panicking and rumors are rampant. Taiwanese newspapers admit that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is "frightening itself." In recent days, the wives and concubines of the Chiang family officials have been moving frantically day and night, searching for so-called "safe" places. On the streets of Taipei, the crowds and vehicles moving houses are congested every day, and thieves and hooligans take the opportunity to engage in large-scale activities.
    Market prices have soared, and industrial, commercial, and banking institutions have been collapsing one after another. In the past two months alone, nearly two hundred factories, businesses, and banks have closed down in the Tainan and Taipei areas. Taiwanese newspapers revealed that many of Chiang's bureaucratic cronies are taking the opportunity to snap up gold and grain. Citizens cannot buy grain and are crying out in misery on the brink of starvation.
    In order to gather a large number of cannon fodder, the US-Chiang group is also seizing men everywhere in Taiwan. In the past two months or more, thousands of young people in Taiwan have been captured by the Chiang bandit army and forced into military service. Not long ago, the Chiang army authorities also transported one hundred women from Taiwan to Jinmen, forcing them to serve as soldiers and military prostitutes.

    人心浮动社会秩序一片混乱
    台湾成了慌乱之岛
    新华社12日讯　美帝国主义和蒋介石集团制造的紧张局势，使台湾成了慌乱之岛。
    现在，台湾社会秩序一片混乱，特别是台中、台南、台北等各主要城镇，人心浮动，谣言频传。台湾报纸承认，蒋介石集团是“自己吓了自己”。连日来，蒋家的官太太和姨太太们像没头苍蝇一样，日夜忙碌地大搬家，到处寻找所谓“安全”之地。在台北街道上，每天搬家的人群和车辆拥挤不堪，盗窃犯和流氓乘机大肆活动。
    市场上物价暴涨，工商业和银行纷纷倒闭。最近两个月以来，倒闭的厂矿、商号、银行，仅是台南和台北地区就增加了近两百家。台湾报纸透露，许多蒋帮的官僚都乘机抢购黄金和粮食。市民买不到粮食，在饥饿线上叫苦连天。
    美蒋为了大量搜罗炮灰，又在台湾到处抓丁。最近两个多月来，台湾有数千青年被蒋贼军捉去当兵。不久前，蒋军当局还把台湾一百个妇女运到金门，强迫她们当兵和作军中妓女。
