    Our People's Liberation Army will do everything possible to fight for the safeguarding of our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. All the people in the rear, both urban and rural, must mobilize, muster greater enthusiasm, and make greater efforts to promote our Great Leap Forward in production, and produce more steel, machinery, and grain. We must extensively establish and develop people's communes. We must accelerate the implementation of universal arming and prepare to respond to the sacred call to defend our great motherland at any time. Let the outwardly strong but inwardly weak American imperialist paper tiger tremble. Victory will surely belong to us.
     —Peng Zhen's Speech at the Rally of People from All Walks of Life in the Capital Supporting the Government's Statement and Demonstrating Against American Aggression

    我们的人民解放军将尽一切努力，为维护我国的主权和领土完整而斗争。一切在后方的城乡人民，一定要动员起来，鼓起更大的干劲，用更大的努力来推动我们的生产大跃进，增产更多的钢铁、机械和粮食。我们一定要广泛地建立和发展人民公社。我们一定要加快实行全民武装，准备随时响应保卫伟大祖国的神圣号召。让外强中干的美帝国主义纸老虎发抖吧，胜利是一定属于我们的。
