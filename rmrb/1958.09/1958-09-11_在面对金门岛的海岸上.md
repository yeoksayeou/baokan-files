    On the Coast Facing Kinmen Island
    Yufeng
    From Xiamen northeastward, on the circular coastline facing Kinmen Island, besides the People's Liberation Army's staunch coastal defense fighters, there are also our heroic militiamen, watching the sea day and night, monitoring the enemy, and awaiting any orders from the motherland.
    Two months ago, I spent a day and a night in a small village close to the sea there, with a small detachment of militia brothers. In the evening, they washed away the sweat and fatigue of the day's labor, lightly shouldered their guns, and quietly walked towards the coast under the starlight. The waves crashed against the rocks, flashing silver spray, and the patrolling militiamen looked around, their eyes emitting a piercing light. The small hut next to the sentry post was their collective home where they took turns sleeping every night.
    Today, the shameless enemy, American imperialism, dares to interfere in our liberation of our sacred territory, and even threatens us with war. At this time, I especially miss the militia brothers I met on the Fujian coast two months ago. I once again pay my respects to you! The people of the whole country are watching the Fujian front, and the people of the whole country are standing behind you, ready to take up arms at any time!
    It is said that long ago, this place was plagued by Japanese pirates, who savagely looted and massacred on a large scale, leaving behind hatred for the invaders and deep national feelings. After liberation, the people became masters, and the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao strengthened their will to defend the motherland. From 1950, they established militia organizations there. For eight years, they held a gun in one hand and a hoe in the other, defending and building the socialist motherland.
    In 1955, there was a famine there for a time. Even at such times, the militiamen did not leave their coastal outposts, and drank seawater when they were hungry. In winter, encountering wind and rain, because they only had one cotton coat, and when it got wet they had no way to change, some people would rather take off their shirts and patrol in the cold of the night.
    Now their living conditions have improved, the militia organization has expanded, and it has become more deeply rooted in the masses and more closely integrated with production. A regular and nationwide struggle against the enemy has been formed there.
    When we walked into the village, before we even found the township government, we encountered so many "hostile" eyes. If you asked questions, even the children wouldn't easily tell you anything. Even if you didn't ask, as long as you were a stranger who appeared for the first time, the little guys would secretly follow you, monitor you, and even come up to question you. But when we came out of the township government, when the comrade in charge of militia work was with us, we immediately received a warm welcome from the whole village. They said these were relatives from Beijing.
    They have achieved that every village has guards and every household has someone on duty. They themselves proposed four guarantees and five safeguards: guaranteeing the area, guaranteeing the situation, guaranteeing surveillance (sea, land, and air), guaranteeing construction sites, safeguarding quality (full staffing of personnel on duty), safeguarding quantity (the number of people mobilized), safeguarding timeliness (being on time for guard duty shifts), safeguarding vigilance, and safeguarding safety.
    The militiamen are not only guards watching over the motherland's gate, but also the core of production. On that blue, quiet sea, in those fishing boats with crimson sails raised, our militiamen are fishing; on the coast, the militiamen manage the rocks and beaches, picking oysters and seaweed, and pouring seawater on the rocks to make potassium chloride fertilizer; in the peanut fields, on the mountains where forests are planted and fruit trees are grown, we can see guns and carrying poles, hoes, and buckets placed together everywhere.
    On this southern seashore, there is strong sunlight, scorching sand, and dense, lush tropical plants, and also strong, enthusiastic, brave, and hardworking people. The militiamen are the most outstanding sons and daughters among them. They absolutely will not allow the ugly American imperialism to stain the motherland's territorial waters. Wherever the enemy pokes its head out, they will crush it!

    在面对金门岛的海岸上
    郁风
    从厦门向东北，在面对着金门岛的环形海岸上，除了人民解放军的坚强的海防战士之外，还有我们的英勇的民兵日夜注视着海上，监视着敌人，等候着祖国的任何命令。
    两个月以前，我曾经在那里紧靠海边的小村庄上过了一天一夜，和一小队民兵弟兄在一起。晚上，他们洗去一天劳动的汗水和疲乏，轻快地背起自己的枪，在星光下悄悄走向海岸。海浪冲击着岩石，闪出银色的水沫，巡逻的民兵了望四方，眼睛里射出逼人的光芒。那哨岗旁边的小屋就是他们每夜轮流睡觉的集体的家。
    今天，无耻的敌人美帝国主义竟敢干涉我们解放自己的神圣领土，还用战争来威吓我们，在这时候我特别想念两个月前在福建海岸边认识的民兵弟兄们，我再一次向你们致敬！全国人民都在注视着福建前线，全国人民都站在你们身后准备随时拿起武器！
    据说在很久以前，这里就闹过倭寇，野蛮地洗劫和大规模屠杀，留下了对侵略者的仇恨和深刻的民族感情。解放了，人民做了主人，共产党和毛主席的恩情更加强了保卫祖国的意志，从1950年起在那里建立了民兵组织，八年来他们一手拿枪，一手拿锄头，捍卫着和建设着社会主义的祖国。
    1955年那里曾一度闹过粮荒，民兵们就在这样的时候也没有离开过海岸的哨岗，饿了就喝海水。在冬天遇着风雨，因为只有一件棉衣，打湿了没得换，有人就宁愿脱光了上身在寒天的深夜里去巡逻。
    如今他们的生活条件改善了，民兵的组织扩大了，更加深入群众，和生产更密切的结合了。在那里形成了经常性的全民性的对敌斗争。
    当我们走进村子，还没有找到乡政府以前，遭遇了多少“敌视”的眼光啊。如果你要是问东问西，连小孩都不会随便告诉你。甚至你就是不问，只要你是第一次出现的生人，小家伙们会暗暗地跟住你，监视你，甚至上来盘问你。但是当我们从乡政府出来，当负责民兵工作的同志和我们在一起，立刻我们受到了全村人的热情接待，他们说这是北京来的亲人。
    他们做到了村村有警卫，户户无闲人。他们自己提出四包和五保，就是包地区、包情况、包监视（海、陆、空）包工地，保质（出勤的人员配备全）、保量（动员的人数）、保时（放哨接班准时）、保警惕、保安全。
    民兵不但是看守祖国大门的警卫，而且是生产中的核心。在那蓝色的静静的海上，在那竖起绛色的帆的渔船中，有我们的民兵在捕鱼；在海岸上民兵管理着岩石和沙滩，采摘牡蛎生蚝和紫菜，在岩石上泼海水晒盐制成氯化钾肥田粉；在花生地里，在造林种果树的山上，我们到处都可以看见枪和扁担、锄头、水桶放在一起。
    在这南方的海边，有着强烈的阳光，灼热的沙和浓绿的厚实的热带植物，也有着健壮、热情、勇敢、勤劳的人民，民兵是他们之中最优秀的儿女，他们绝对不容许丑恶的美帝国主义沾污祖国的领海，敌人从哪里钻出头来就在哪里粉碎他的脑袋！
