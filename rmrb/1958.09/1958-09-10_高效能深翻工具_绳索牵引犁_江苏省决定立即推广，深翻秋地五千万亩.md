　　Jiangsu Province Decides to Immediately Promote Deep Ploughing of 50 Million Mu of Autumn Land
    This Dispatch from Nanjing: (Reporter Yan Fengming) Jiangsu Province is vigorously promoting deep ploughing tools based on rope traction machines, requiring all 50 million mu of autumn-sown land in the province to be deep ploughed to a depth of one chi or more, to strive for an even greater bumper harvest of summer crops next year.
    The deep ploughing rope traction machines designed and manufactured by the masses in various parts of Jiangsu Province have six types of power sources: human, animal, wind, water, mechanical, and electrical.
    Various power-driven rope traction machines have demonstrated great power in deep ploughing. The efficiency of rope traction machines in deep ploughing is at least five times higher than that of manual deep ploughing or animal-powered ploughing, and the efficiency of mechanical and electrical power is as high as dozens or even hundreds of times. The electric rope traction machine in Wuxi County, pulling a two-way plow, with two people operating it, can cultivate three mu per hour at a depth of more than one chi. The mechanical rope traction machines in Fengxian County and Changshu County, using a ten-horsepower engine to pull a double-furrow plow, with two people operating it, can cultivate 1.5 mu per hour at a depth of more than eight and a half cun. The wind-powered rope traction machines in Yancheng County and Gaoyou County, in a level three wind, with one person operating it, without stopping day or night, can cultivate 10 to 14 mu per day at a depth of more than one chi. The human and animal-powered rope traction machines in Xinghua County and Nantong County, pulling ordinary deep ploughing plows, deep plough one chi two to one chi five, can cultivate four to five mu in one day. In Nantong County, the thrust of the human-powered rope traction machine is lighter and more efficient after installing three layers of bearings. These rope traction machines can all be installed in field factories for operation.
    In addition to deep ploughing, various power-driven rope traction machines have the following common advantages: First, they are highly adaptable and are not restricted by any natural conditions. Highland fields, lowland fields, dry fields, and paddy fields can be cultivated day and night. Especially in paddy fields, they have more and greater advantages than tractors. Second, they can exert greater traction. Various power-driven rope traction machines are installed on the edge of the field, and all of its power is used to pull the plow, unlike tractors that drive into the field, where 75% of the power is used to propel itself. Third, they save materials and have low costs. An electric rope traction machine, not including the two-way plow and steel wire rope, only costs more than 200 yuan. A mechanical rope traction machine, including an engine of six horsepower or more, belts, steel wire ropes, and shafts, costs about 500 yuan in total. A human or animal-powered traction machine, except for more than half a jin of iron for the machine core, is all made of wood and is worth about 30 to 40 yuan. The wind-powered rope traction machine uses the original windmill and costs almost nothing. Compared with tractors, a lot of steel is saved.
    The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has attached great importance to these bold and unconventional inventions and creations of the masses. According to the needs of the current deep ploughing task and the material conditions of various places, implementing the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and the principle of starting with indigenous methods first, and then progressing from indigenous to foreign, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee has decided to immediately vigorously promote the two types of human and animal-powered rope traction machines designed by the people of Taixing County throughout the province.
    Taixing County is the first county in Jiangsu Province to basically realize the mechanization of human and animal-powered rope traction machines. On August 19, the county only had 650 rope traction machines, but in just ten days by August 28, it surged to more than 5,500 machines. The human and animal-powered rope traction machines in this county have many advantages, in addition to the four mentioned above, such as deep ploughing and high work efficiency, there are also three advantages: First, the structure is simple and easy to imitate. Zhuli Township imitated 43 units in one day. Second, the "firecracker bullets" are installed on the winding reel, making operation convenient, and both the old and the young can push it. Third, because of the above two points, plus the low cost, the manufacturing is fast, the promotion is fast, and it plays a role quickly.
    At present, technicians from the Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute and cadres from relevant Jiangsu provincial leading organs responsible for agricultural tool reform are further studying and resolving the shortcomings of various power-driven rope traction machines and further improving their efficiency based on the designs of the masses, and are giving full play to the comprehensive utilization capabilities of rope traction machines in agriculture, sideline occupations, and other aspects.

　　高效能深翻工具——绳索牵引犁
　　江苏省决定立即推广，深翻秋地五千万亩
    本报南京电　记者严锋明报道：江苏省大力推广以绳索牵引机为主的深翻工具，要求做到全省五千万亩秋种田全部深翻一尺以上，以争取明年夏熟作物的更大丰收。
    江苏省各地群众设计、制造的深翻绳索牵引机，由于动力来源不同，已有人力、畜力、风力、水力、机力和电力六种。
    各种动力的绳索牵引机已在土地深翻中大显威风。绳索牵引机在深翻土地中的效能，比原来用人工深翻土或畜力牵犁深翻土的效能，最少提高五倍，机力和电力的效能高达几十倍、上百倍。无锡县的电力绳索牵引机，牵引双向犁，两人操作，深翻一尺以上，每小时能耕三亩。奉贤县和常熟县的机力绳索牵引机，用十马力引擎牵引双铧犁，两人操作，深耕八寸半以上，每小时能耕一点五亩。盐城县和高邮县的风力绳索牵引机，三级风，一人操作，昼夜不歇，深翻一尺以上，每天能耕十亩到十四亩。兴化县和南通县的人畜力绳索牵引机，牵引一般深耕犁，深翻一尺二到一尺五，一个白天能耕四亩到五亩。南通县将人力绳索牵引机装上三层轴承后，推力更轻，效力更高。这些绳索牵引机，都可以安装在田头厂房里进行操作。
    各种动力的绳索牵引机，除了能深耕以外，还有以下几个共同的优点：第一，适应性强，不受任何自然条件限制，高田、低田、旱田、水田，白天、黑夜，都可耕作。尤其在水田中，比拖拉机有更多、更大的优越性。第二，可以发挥较大的牵引力。各种动力的绳索牵引机都装置在田边上，它的全部力量都在牵引犁头，不像拖拉机开到田里去，75％的动力用在自身的发动上。第三，省材料，成本低。一部电力绳索牵引机，不连双向犁和钢丝绳在内，只要二百多元。机力绳索牵引机包括六马力以上的引擎、皮带、钢丝绳和轴在内，全部成本在五百元左右。一部人力或畜力牵引机，除用半斤多重的铁做机心外，全是木材制成的，约值三、四十元。而风力绳索牵引机，利用原有风车，差不多不花钱。比起拖拉机来，节省了大量钢铁。
    中共江苏省委对各地群众这些大胆破格的创造发明，都给以极大的重视。根据当前深翻土地任务的需要和各地物质条件，贯彻多快好省的精神和先用土法上马，从土到洋的方针，江苏省委决定立即在全省范围内大力推广泰兴县人民设计的人力和畜力两种绳索牵引机。
    泰兴县是江苏省第一个基本实现人力和畜力绳索牵引机化的县。8月19日全县只有绳索牵引机六百五十部，而到8月28日短短十天中，猛跃到五千五百多部。这个县的人力和畜力绳索牵引机的优点很多，除了前面提到的能深耕、工效高等四条以外，还有三个优点：第一，结构简单，仿制容易。朱李乡一天就仿造了四十三部。第二，绞绳盘上安装“爆仗弹子”，操作方便，老少都能推动。第三，由于上面两条加上造价便宜，因而制造快，推广快，发挥作用快。
    现在，南京农业机械化研究所技术人员和江苏省级有关领导机关负责农具改革工作的干部，正在各地群众设计的基础上，进一步研究解决各种动力的绳索牵引机存在的缺点，进一步提高效能，并发挥绳索牵引机在农业、副业等方面的综合利用能力。
