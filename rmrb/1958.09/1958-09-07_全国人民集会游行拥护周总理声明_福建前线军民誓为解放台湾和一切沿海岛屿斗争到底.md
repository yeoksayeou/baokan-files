Xinhua News Agency Report:

　　The Chinese people have long harbored immense anger towards the heinous activities of the most ferocious enemy of peace-loving people worldwide – American imperialism – in occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan and supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in carrying out armed harassment against the mainland. On the evening of the 6th, when Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait was broadcast, the people of many large cities across the country who first heard the statement were filled with righteous indignation and unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support for Premier Zhou's statement, resolutely opposing American military provocations and war threats. People in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Wuhan, and Chengdu, as well as the broad masses of soldiers and civilians on the Fujian front, gathered and took to the streets to demonstrate. Slogans such as "American troops get out of the Taiwan area!", "Oppose American interference in our internal affairs!", "We must liberate Kinmen and Matsu!", and "We must liberate Taiwan!" resounded through the skies. In many cities, the streets were still bustling with activity late into the night, as people were filled with irrepressible anger. Tens of thousands of people expressed to the Party that they would support whatever the motherland needed, and go wherever the motherland needed them, to shatter American imperialism's war provocations and military threats.

　　According to Xinhua News Agency on the 6th: Beijing was a city of bustling activity tonight, with vast numbers of people in the city and suburbs gathering and demonstrating, unanimously and enthusiastically supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait, and angrily condemning American imperialism's military provocations and war threats.

　　After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait at 19:00 hours, the more than six million citizens of Beijing were immediately aroused to immense anger at American imperialism's military provocations and war threats. They shouted with irrepressible rage, "Oppose American imperialism's threat to peace in the Far East and the world!", "We must liberate Kinmen and Matsu!", "We must liberate Taiwan!" In front of loudspeakers in various public places, people could not remain still, and the voice opposing American interference in our internal affairs echoed in response. People raised their fists and shouted, "American imperialist troops get out of the Taiwan area!" Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant were holding a rally, and newly formed militiamen, carrying various types of guns, shouted their respects to the heroic soldiers on the Fujian front. Steelworkers beside the iron smelting furnaces expressed their determination to work even harder to support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating its own territory of Taiwan.

　　Currently, many factories, schools, government agencies, military units, street residents, and rural people's communes are holding rallies and taking to the streets to demonstrate.

　　According to Xinhua News Agency at 21:30 on the 6th: Beijing is now experiencing thunderstorms, but the crowds demonstrating against American imperialism's military provocations are still carrying cartoons, banners, and even performing skits, singing the song "We Must Liberate Taiwan" in the rain.

　　Demonstrations began to appear on the streets at 20:00 hours. In an instant, East and West Chang'an Avenue, from Dongdan to Beixinqiao, from Xidan to Xinjiekou, from Qianmen to Yongdingmen, and the streets and lanes near these main streets, were quickly filled with demonstrating crowds. More than 200 workers from the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, rushing from the eastern suburban industrial area, performed their newly created skit, "Yankees, Get Out of Taiwan!" on the square. Processions moving from east to west and from west to east quickly passed through Tiananmen Square. When the procession passed in front of the Xinqiao Hotel, representatives and observers from many countries attending the 5th World Student Congress, who were staying at the hotel, crowded in front of the hotel and enthusiastically applauded the procession.

　　The demonstrations quickly shifted from the urban area to the suburbs and industrial areas. Five thousand members of the Shangyou People's Commune in Fengtai marched in the rain, singing their self-composed song "Liberate Taiwan and Oppose Aggression." The militiamen of this commune shouted: "Run the commune well, defend the commune, step up production, and liberate Taiwan!" Workers at the Beijing Steel Plant, who were fighting for steel, did not take off their work clothes after finishing their shift and immediately held a large-scale demonstration outside the plant. More than 3,000 teachers and students from Beijing Normal College also gave speeches on the streets during the demonstration, and people on the streets followed them in shouting slogans.

　　In addition to workers, farmers, and students, the demonstrators included government cadres, housewives from the streets, and working people. Currently, demonstrations in the urban and suburban areas are continuing. The broad masses of people in factories, rural areas, schools, shops, government agencies, streets, newly established people's communes, and people's armed organizations are preparing overnight for a larger-scale demonstration against American imperialism's interference in our internal affairs.

　　According to Xinhua News Agency from the Fujian front on the 6th: The broad masses of soldiers and civilians on the Fujian front enthusiastically support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait, angrily condemning American imperialism's acts of aggression against the Chinese people, and unanimously expressed: We vow to fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan and all enemy-occupied coastal islands, and to defend the inviolability of the motherland's territory, territorial waters, and airspace!

　　Wang Xinghua, deputy squadron leader of a naval gunboat unit that severely damaged a Chiang bandit Jiang-class warship on September 1, said that American imperialism dares to openly declare that it will expand the scope of aggression in the Taiwan Strait area, which is a serious war provocation against the Chinese people. We love peace, but we are never afraid of war. If the American aggressors dare to play with fire, we will certainly retaliate tit-for-tat and give them a resolute counterattack.

　　The heroic artillerymen guarding the coastal defense positions also unanimously expressed their firm support for Premier Zhou's statement. Gunner Wan Guanjin said indignantly: Dulles said that the Chinese people are disrupting peace, which is complete nonsense. In fact, it is American imperialism's warships that have entered the Taiwan Strait to carry out war provocations and disrupt peace. We are determined to give a heavy blow to American imperialism, which is undermining peace in the Far East and the world. Lan Guixiang, a soldier of an air force unit, said: Our people's air force must resolutely fulfill its sacred duty to defend the motherland's airspace. If the American aggressive air force dares to invade, we will never forgive it!

　　Zhou Fangshun, political instructor of a torpedo boat unit of the People's Navy, who participated in sinking a Chiang bandit military ship transporting troops to Kinmen on August 24, said: The Chinese people who have stood up cannot be intimidated by any aggressor. We will never tolerate American imperialism's war provocations, and it will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

　　The people from all walks of life in Fujian Province, enraged by American imperialism's war provocations, are unanimously determined to actively support the People's Liberation Army in resolutely striking at the Chiang bandit troops who are constantly attacking peaceful residents on the mainland.

　　Liu Tong, chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Lin Zhuguang, chairman of the Fuzhou Overseas Chinese Federation, and others also unanimously and enthusiastically supported Premier Zhou's statement after hearing it. Liu Tong said that the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands. If American imperialism wants to impose war on the Chinese people, the Chinese people have the determination and strength to fight American imperialism to the end. He called on Kuomintang military and government personnel under the Chiang gang's rule who still have a conscience not to act as accomplices, to suddenly embrace the motherland, and to contribute their share to the liberation of Taiwan and the maintenance of peace. Lin Zhuguang said that the liberation of Taiwan is a major event that overseas Chinese have been eagerly awaiting day and night. The broad masses of overseas Chinese are determined to work hard in all aspects to fight unremittingly for the integrity of our country's territory and sovereignty. Taiwan compatriots living in Fuzhou City were even more encouraged by Premier Zhou's statement. Wang Tianqiang, director of the preparatory committee of the Fujian Provincial Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said: We Taiwan compatriots in Fuzhou guarantee to better complete our work tasks and vow to fight to the end for the recovery of Taiwan and Penghu.

    据新华社6日讯　北京今晚全城人声鼎沸，市内和郊区广大群众纷纷集会游行，一致热烈拥护周恩来总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，怒斥美帝国主义的军事挑衅和战争威胁。
    北京六百多万市民在十九时收听了周恩来总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明后，立刻激起对美帝国主义的军事挑衅和战争威胁的无比愤怒，他们怒不可遏地高呼“反对美国帝国主义威胁远东和世界和平！”“一定要解放金门、马祖！”“一定要解放台湾！”各个公共场所的扩音器前，人们无法静止下来，反对美帝国主义干涉我国内政的声音一呼百应，人们高举着拳头，高呼“美帝国主义军队从台湾地区滚出去！”石景山钢铁厂的工人正在举行集会，新组成的民兵背着各式枪枝，高呼向英勇的福建前线将士致敬。炼铁炉旁的钢铁工人表示要更加加劲生产，以支援中国人民解放军解放自己的领土台湾。
    现在，很多工厂、学校、机关、部队、街道居民和农村人民公社都在举行集会，纷纷上街示威游行。
    据新华社6日21时30分讯　北京城现在雷雨交加，为反对美国帝国主义的军事挑衅而举行示威游行的人群，还在抬着漫画、标语牌，有的还演着活报剧，在雷雨中高唱“一定要解放台湾”的歌曲。
    示威游行的人群，在二十时开始出现在街头。转瞬之间，在东西长安街，东单到北新桥，西单到新街口，前门到永定门，以及这些主要街道的附近街巷，都迅速挤满了示威游行的人群。从东郊工业区赶来的第一机床厂二百多名职工，在广场上演出了他们刚编出来的活报剧“美帝从台湾滚出去！”由东向西和由西向东的游行队伍，穿梭般地从天安门广场上迅速走过。当游行队伍经过新侨饭店门前时，住在这个饭店的参加第五届世界学生代表大会的很多国家的代表和观察员们，都拥挤在饭店门前向游行的队伍热烈鼓掌。
    示威游行迅速从城区转到郊区和工业区。丰台上游人民公社五千社员，唱着他们自编的“解放台湾反侵略”的歌曲冒雨游行。这个公社的民兵们高呼：“办好公社，保卫公社，加紧生产，解放台湾！”正在为钢而战的北京钢厂的工人，在下班后，没有脱下工作服，立即到厂外举行了示威大游行。北京师范学院三千多名师生在示威游行时，还分别在街头演讲，街上的人也跟着他们高呼口号。
    在示威游行的队伍中，除工人、农民、学生外，还有机关干部和街道上的家庭妇女和劳动群众。现在，城区和郊区的示威游行，正在继续进行。各工厂、农村、学校、商店、机关、街道和新成立的人民公社、人民武装组织的广大群众，都在连夜准备一个更大规模的反对美帝国主义干涉我国内政的示威活动。

    曾在9月1日重创一艘蒋贼江字号军舰的海军某炮艇部队副中队长王兴华说，美帝国主义胆敢公开声称要扩大对台湾海峡地区的侵略范围，这是对中国人民严重的战争挑衅。我们热爱和平。但是决不怕战争。美国侵略者如果胆敢玩火，我们就必将以眼还眼，以牙还牙，给它以坚决回击。
    守卫在海防阵地上的英雄炮兵们也一致表示坚决拥护和支持周总理的声明。炮手万关锦愤慨地说：杜勒斯说中国人民破坏和平，这完全是胡说，事实上正是美帝国主义的军舰开进了台湾海峡，进行战争挑衅，破坏和平。我们坚决要给破坏远东和世界和平的美帝国主义以沉重反击。空军某部战士蓝桂祥说：我们人民空军要坚决履行自己保卫祖国领空的神圣职责，如果美国侵略空军胆敢前来侵犯，我们决不饶恕它！
    曾经在8月24日参加击沉一艘蒋贼军向金门运兵军舰的人民海军鱼雷快艇某部指导员周方顺说：站起来了的中国人民是任何侵略者所吓不倒的，我们决不能容忍美帝国主义对我国的战争挑衅，它必将遭到可耻的失败。
    为美帝国主义战争挑衅激怒了的福建省各界人民一致决心积极支援人民解放军坚决打击不断袭击大陆和平居民的蒋贼军。
    中国国民党革命委员会福建省委员会主任委员刘通、福州市归国华侨联合会主席林珠光等，听到周总理的声明也一致热烈拥护。刘通说，中国人民一定要解放台湾和沿海岛屿，如果美帝国主义要把战争强加在中国人民头上，中国人民有决心有力量同美帝国主义斗争到底。他要求在蒋帮统治下的良心没泯的国民党军政人员耻于为虎作伥，恍然投入祖国怀抱，为解放台湾，维护和平贡献出自己一份力量。林珠光说，解放台湾是华侨日夜渴望的一件大事。广大华侨定从各个方面努力为我国的领土和主权的完整，斗争不懈。旅居福州市的台湾同胞更为周总理的声明所鼓舞。台湾民主自治同盟福建省支部筹备委员会主任王天强说：我们在福州的台湾同胞，保证更好地完成工作任务，誓为收复台湾、澎湖斗争到底。
