This newspaper reports: Shanghai, September 2nd (Reporter Lu Zuohua) The Shanghai Second Medical College Affiliated Guangci Hospital, which rescued Shanggang worker Qiu CaiKang, has, under the leadership of the Party, also saved Deng Mingqi, a patient with 94% burns. The patient was admitted to the hospital on July 24th and is recovering quickly, and will be discharged before the end of September.

Deng Mingqi's burn area was more extensive than Qiu CaiKang's, but the treatment process was shortened, demonstrating the ability to rescue patients from the brink of death.

Deng Mingqi is a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. On July 24th, he was burned due to a broken high-voltage power line causing a fire. The skin from the top of his head to the back of his feet was injured, with only the soles of his feet and a small area of his waist spared. Third-degree deep burns accounted for about 10%. Deng Mingqi had a lot of mud on his body when he was injured and was only taken to the hospital seven hours later, making his condition more dangerous than Qiu CaiKang's.

When Deng Mingqi was first admitted to the hospital, the Party Committee of the Second Medical College was summarizing the work of rescuing Qiu CaiKang, and also making a preliminary medical summary of extensive burns. Therefore, the Party Committee required that this treatment not only be like the rescue of Qiu CaiKang, but also ensure that the patient was not infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and did not develop sepsis. The medical staff who participated in the battle to rescue Qiu CaiKang, absorbed the existing experience, further pursued the mass line, and the medical treatment and medication were collectively discussed. The director of surgery and the attending physicians, among others, took turns on duty all night for the first three days, frequently examining the patient and culturing bacteria on the patient's body and in the blood. Only on the ninth day was Pseudomonas aeruginosa positive cultured in the blood. Due to the great leap forward in laboratory work, the original three-day turnaround for test results was shortened to twelve hours, and reported to the doctor, thus, it was dealt with in a timely manner and did not spread. Based on the experience of multiple skin grafts, starting from reality, Deng Mingqi only underwent three skin grafts. The first was conductor skin graft, donated by three staff and students of Shanghai Second Medical College from their own bodies. Autologous skin grafting was performed twice. Now the new skin in the first and second degree burns has grown well, the body temperature and pulse are normal, and he can sit up and eat, with a very good appetite.

Shanggang worker Qiu CaiKang has now completely emerged from the danger period and is entering a recuperation stage. In addition to the necessary medical care, a hand plastic surgery will be performed for him; at the same time, limb function recovery training will be carried out. According to doctors, Qiu CaiKang can be discharged from the hospital in mid-November this year.

Since Qiu CaiKang, Guangci Hospital has successively received eighteen severely burned patients from Ningbo, Taicang, Nantong and Shanghai, and three patients have been cured and discharged. The doctors at Guangci Hospital are now conducting further research, not only requiring the rescue of any patients with extensive burns, but also achieving painless burn treatment.

    上海广慈医院运用抢救丘财康的经验
　　又治好几个烧伤病人
    本报上海2日电　记者陆左华报道：抢救上钢工人丘财康的上海第二医学院附属广慈医院，在党的领导下又救治了一个烧伤面积94％的病人邓明琪。病人是7月24日进院的，创伤恢复得很快，将在9月底以前出院。
    邓明琪的烧伤面积比丘财康更加广泛，但是治疗过程更加缩短，能抢救病人起死回生。
    邓明琪是中国人民解放军的战士，7月24日由于高压电线断线，引起失火而被烧伤的，从头顶到脚背的皮肤都受了伤，只有两只脚底和腰部一小块地方幸免。其中三度深度灼伤占10％左右。邓明琪受伤时，身上沾了许多污泥，而且在七小时后才送到医院，病情比丘财康更危险。
    当邓明琪刚送进医院时，中共第二医学院党委正在进行抢救丘财康工作的总结，同时也在进行对广泛面积灼伤的初步医疗小结。因此党委要求这次治疗，不仅要像抢救丘财康一样，而且还要做到病人不要受绿脓杆菌感染，不发生败血症。经过抢救丘财康战斗的医护人员，吸取已有的经验，进一步走群众路线，医疗以及用药都经过集体讨论。外科主任和主治医师等人，头三天通宵轮流值班，经常为病人作检查，并在病人身上和血液中作细菌的培养。只有第九天在血液中培出一次绿脓杆菌阳性，由于化验工作的大跃进，把原来必须三天时间才能得出化验结果，缩短为十二小时，就向医生报告，因此，得到及时处理，没有蔓延。根据多次植皮的经验，从实际出发，邓明琪只经过三次植皮，第一次是导体植皮，由上海第二医学院三个工作人员和学生，从自己身上捐献，自体植皮二次。现在一度、两度伤处的新皮肤已经长好，体温、脉搏都正常，并能起坐进餐，胃口很好。
    上钢工人丘财康目前已完全脱离危险期，进入休养阶段。今后除了必要的医护，也将为他做一次手部整形手术；同时作四肢功能恢复训练。据医生说，丘财康今年11月中旬可以出院。
    从丘财康以后，广慈医院陆续收到宁波、太仓、南通和上海等地送来十八个严重烧伤病人，已有三个病人治愈出院。广慈医院的医生，现在正在进一步研究，非但要求救活任何广泛烧伤面积的病人，还要做到治疗烧伤无痛。
