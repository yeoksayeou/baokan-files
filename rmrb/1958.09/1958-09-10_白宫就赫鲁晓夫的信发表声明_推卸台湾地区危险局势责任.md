Xinhua News Agency, New Port, Rhode Island, 9th. White House Press Secretary Hagerty issued a statement on the 8th regarding Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's letter to the American President, saying that Khrushchev pointed out in his letter that the situation in the Taiwan area "is a dangerous situation." The United States has "recognized this danger, and it hopes that the resumption of ambassadorial talks between the United States and the Chinese Communist regime will alleviate this danger."

However, this statement avoided answering the question raised by Khrushchev regarding the withdrawal of American troops from the Taiwan Strait. It continued to confuse right and wrong, describing the dangerous situation in the Taiwan area, which was created single-handedly by the United States, as necessary military measures taken by the Chinese people to punish the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops. The statement also disregarded the fact that the United States used force to occupy Chinese territory and attempted to continue to expand its occupation by force, once again unreasonably describing the Chinese people's determination to liberate their sacred territory as "ambitions to realize territory."

The statement said that after Eisenhower had the opportunity to conduct "a more thorough study" of this letter, he might reply to it.

    白宫就赫鲁晓夫的信发表声明
　　推卸台湾地区危险局势责任
    新华社9日讯　罗得岛新港消息：白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂8日就苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫给美国总统的信发表声明说，赫鲁晓夫在他的信中指出台湾地区的局势“是一种危险的局势”。美国已经“认识到这种危险，它并且希望，美国和中国共产党政权的大使级会谈的恢复会使这种危险得到缓和。”
    但是，这篇声明避而不答赫鲁晓夫提出的美国军队从台湾海峡撤退的问题。它继续混淆是非，把美国一手造成的台湾地区危险局势说成是由于中国人民为了惩罚蒋贼军而采取的必要的军事措施。声明还不顾美国用武力侵占中国领土并且企图继续用武力扩大占领中国领土的事实，再一次无理地把中国人民解放自己神圣领土的决心说成是“实现领土的野心”。
    声明说，在艾森豪威尔有机会对这封信进行“更充分的研究”以后，他可能会答复这封信。
