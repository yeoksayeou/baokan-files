The U.S. and Britain Never Intended to Stop Nuclear Tests!
   Government Officials and Newspapers Reveal the Truth

    (Dispatch from this newspaper) On August 22nd, the U.S. and British governments each issued statements announcing that they were prepared to cease nuclear weapons testing for one year starting on October 31st. However, since then, numerous talks and news items revealed and published by government officials, newspapers, and news agencies of the U.S. and Britain indicate that this is far from the case. These talks and news items are like asides in an ancient play, revealing the true intentions of the actors. Listen to this:

    On the same day the U.S. government issued its statement, a White House official came out and said: "It would be wrong to think that the U.S. is proposing a permanent cessation of testing."

    Authoritative American sources also pointed out that the President's statement was not a change in policy, but merely a change in approach. Therefore, United Press International emphasized in a report: "The arms race will not stop because the three major powers agree to cease testing. The United States will continue to complete all types of atomic weapons, large and small. It will try to continue to employ scientists and technicians who test weapons, and keep its equipment ready for use again when this step of stopping testing fails to promote the further steps it expects towards genuine disarmament." Why are U.S. officials and news agencies so busy expressing their true intentions? It turns out that these words are actually intended to reassure the giants of the major monopoly capital, because, reportedly, the direct representatives of those monopoly companies, namely officials in the U.S. Department of Defense and Atomic Energy, were "uneasy" about this decision. Now they can rest assured about their moneybags, the arms race will continue.

    To further eliminate misunderstandings, United Press International added: "The decision to stop testing for one year was not due to the U.S. government recently reaching any conclusion that the radiation produced by testing is particularly harmful to the people of the world." Precisely because of this, at the same time that the U.S. and Britain issued their statements to stop nuclear testing for one year, the U.S. government was conducting a series of nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific region. And the British government, not long before August 22nd, "hurriedly ordered the British test team on Christmas Island in the Pacific to speed up their work."

    U.S. and British newspapers also pointed out the mystery behind the selection of October 31st as the start date for the cessation of nuclear weapons testing by the two governments. "The New York Times" said: This is because the current series of tests in the United States "will end soon," and "twelve to twenty-four months are needed to carefully study the results of large-scale tests." Just as the British "Daily Telegraph" said, hydrogen bombs currently need a "holiday."

    So what is the purpose of the current willingness of the U.S. and Britain to suspend nuclear weapons testing? According to United Press International, this is Dulles's idea of "using political weapons to wage the Cold War." American newspapers have pointed out that world public opinion has reacted very well to the Soviet Union's cessation of atomic weapons testing and demanded that the United States follow its example. The United States' initial refusal to do so had "caused the United States to lose prestige in neutral countries" ("Christian Science Monitor"). Therefore, continuing to ignore the concerns of millions of people is simply "political stupidity" ("New York Times"). This is one reason. Secondly, hydrogen bombs currently need a "holiday." Thirdly, U.S. and British newspapers emphasized one condition in their reports on this statement: that the Soviet Union, after voluntarily announcing a unilateral cessation of testing on March 31st of this year, would continue to cease testing for another year following the U.S. and Britain. In short, the United States wants to kill two birds with one stone: deceive world public opinion and, at the same time, use this deception to weaken the Soviet Union's strength. This is the new weapon in Dulles's Cold War arsenal.

　　美英哪里是想停止核试验！
    两国政府官员和报纸透露出真情
    本报讯　8月22日美英两国政府分别发表声明，宣布它们准备在10月31日起停止核武器试验一年。但是从那时以来，美英的政府官员、报纸、通讯社所透露和发表出来的大量的谈话和消息，却表明远不是那回事。这些谈话和消息有似古代演戏中的旁白一样，它说出了那个演戏人心里的真心话。请听：
    就在美国政府发表声明的同一天，白宫官员就出来说：“如果认为美国是在提议永久停止试验，那将是错误的”。
    美国的权威人士也指出，总统的声明不是政策上的改变，而只是做法上的改变。因此合众国际社在一则报道中强调说：“军备竞赛是不会由于三大国同意停止试验而停止的。美国将继续完成各种类型的大大小小的原子武器。它将设法继续雇用试验武器的科学家和技术人员，并保持它的设备随时备用，以便在这种停止试验的步骤不能促成走向真正裁军的它所期待的进一步步骤的时候再次使用”。美国官员和通讯社为什么忙着表白心意呢？原来这些话实际上是为的安慰那些大垄断资本的巨头们，因为据报道，那些垄断公司的直接代表人，即美国国防部和原子能方面的官员对这个决定是“感到不安”的。现在他们可以对自己的钱袋放心了，军备竞赛还会继续的。
    为了进一步消除误会，美国合众国际社又说：“作出停止试验一年的决定并不是由于美国政府新近得出了什么结论，认为试验产生的放射性对世界人民特别有害”。正因为如此，就在美英发表停止核试验一年的声明的同时，美国政府正在太平洋地区进行了一系列的核武器试验。而英国政府也在8月22日前不久“火速命令太平洋圣诞岛上的英国试验队，叫他们加速工作”。
    美英报刊对于两国政府选定10月31日这个日期作为停止核武器试验开始的日子，也指出其中的奥妙。“纽约时报”说：这是因为美国当前的一系列试验“将于最近结束”，而“为了仔细地研究大规模试验的结果，需要十二个月到二十四个月的时间”。也正如英国“每日电讯报”所说的，目前氢弹需要一个“休假”。
    那末目前美英表示愿意暂停核武器试验目的何在呢？据合众国际社报道说，这是杜勒斯的“必须用政治武器来进行冷战”的主张。美国报纸曾经指出：世界舆论对苏联停止试验原子武器的反映很好并且要求美国仿效它的榜样。而美国当初拒绝这样做已使“美国在中立国家中失去了威信”（“基督教科学箴言报”）。因此，继续无视千百万人的忧虑，这简直是“政治上的愚蠢”（“纽约时报”）。这是一，其次目前氢弹正需要一个“休假期”，第三美英报刊在报道这项声明时也着重指出其中一个条件是要苏联在今年3月31日主动宣布单方面停止试验后再跟着美英继续停止一年。概言之，美国是想一箭双雕；欺骗世界舆论；同时利用这个欺骗削弱苏联的力量。这就是杜勒斯的冷战武库中的新法宝。
