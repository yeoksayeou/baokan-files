　　"Collodion" as a Substitute for Surgical Sutures
　　Using a quick-drying "collodion" to replace "surgical sutures" for incisions after surgery is a new achievement in technological innovation by obstetricians and gynecologists at the Shanghai State-Owned Trading Enterprise Workers' Hospital, which has been praised by patients.
　　After surgery, patients generally need to have the outer layer of the skin incision sutured with silk thread, wrapped in more than a dozen layers of gauze and thick cotton pads to prevent infection, and the silk thread is removed after the incision has healed. Now, with this quick-drying glue agent "collodion" containing ether, the incision only needs to be aligned and the glue agent applied, without suturing. After the incision heals, the glue agent will also fall off naturally. The advantages of using this glue agent are that it shortens the operation time and reduces the pain of suture removal for patients.

### 代替手术缝合的“火棉胶”

　　代替手术缝合的“火棉胶”
    用一种快速干燥的“火棉胶”代替病人开刀后切口的“手术缝合”，这是上海国营贸易企业职工医院妇产科医生在技术革新中一项深受病人赞扬的新成就。
    病人开刀后，一般都要用丝线把皮肤外层的切口缝合，包扎上十多层纱布和厚厚的棉花垫，防止感染，待切口愈合后再把丝线拆除。现在用这种含有醚的快干的胶剂“火棉胶”，只要把切口拉齐，涂上胶剂，不再缝合，切口愈合以后，胶剂也会自然脱落。使用这种胶剂的好处是缩短手术时间，减少病人缝线拆线的痛苦。
