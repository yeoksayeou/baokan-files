Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 4th: The Polish newspaper "Warsaw Life" published an article on the 2nd titled "Astonishing Numbers," stating that People's China is indeed a country where great miracles occur. The pace of economic development in China has greatly accelerated recently, now even surpassing the achievements of the Soviet Union's first few five-year plans.

The article points out that the new production plan figures for 1958, released at the recent expanded meeting of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, are indeed astonishing: China will produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year, doubling last year's output. The article says that if we look back, we can see that this plan has been expanded; the original plan stipulated that 6.248 million tons of steel would be produced in 1958. After the first revision, the plan was increased to 7 million tons. At that time, this plan seemed very bold, but it still underestimated China's actual potential. The pace of economic development in China has greatly accelerated recently, now even surpassing the achievements of the Soviet Union's first few five-year plans, which is a fact. The recently published communique on China's production results for the first half of 1958 is proof of this.

The article then cited some facts to illustrate the huge speed of China's economic construction, believing that even more astonishing production achievements are in agriculture. The article also talked about the development of China's water conservancy and afforestation undertakings, and pointed out that the fact that China has built a large number of large, medium, and small enterprises more clearly illustrates the acceleration of China's industrialization.

The article concludes by pointing out that the accurate figures of economic development supplied by reliable sources in China are truly remarkable and worthy of constant attention.

　　中国出现伟大奇迹
    “华沙生活报”赞颂我国大跃进
    新华社华沙4日电　波兰的“华沙生活报”2日在题为“惊人的数字”的文章中说，人民中国的确是一个出现伟大奇迹的国家。最近时期中国经济发展速度大大加快，现在甚至超过了苏联头几个五年计划的成就。
    文章指出，最近中国共产党中央政治局扩大会议发表的1958年新的生产计划数字，的确是惊人的：中国今年将生产一千零七十万吨钢，比去年增加一倍。文章说，我们只要回顾一下就可以知道，这个计划曾经扩大过，原来的计划规定1958年生产六百二十四万八千吨钢。计划经过第一次修改后增加到七百万吨。那时看来这个计划就是非常大胆的，但是对中国的实际潜力仍然估计得很不足。最近时期中国经济发展速度大大加快了，现在甚至超过了苏联头几个五年计划的成就，这是事实。最近发表的中国1958年上半年生产成果的公报就是证明。
    文章随后引用了一些事实来说明中国经济建设的巨大发展速度，认为更为惊人的生产成就是在农业方面。文章还谈到了中国水利和造林事业的发展，并且指出，中国建成大批的大、中、小型企业的事实，更加清楚地说明了中国工业化速度的加快。
    文章最后指出，从中国可靠方面供给的经济发展的确实数字真是了不起的，是值得经常注意的。
