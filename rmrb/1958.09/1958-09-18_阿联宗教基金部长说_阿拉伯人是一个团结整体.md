Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 16th: Ahmed Hassan al-Baquri, Minister of Religious Endowments of the United Arab Republic, said at a press conference held in Homs yesterday that the Arab people are a united and unanimous whole in the struggle against imperialism. We will never allow imperialism to create discord and disputes among us, or to use our religious or sectarian issues.

He said that Western imperialism often wants to create hatred and sectarian discord among our citizens. Not only that, imperialism also wants to create disputes between Christians and Muslims, and even between various Islamic sects and groups. Baquri said that we must eradicate the influence left by imperialism, because they regard us as colored people and slaves, and only want to exploit and use us. He also condemned the United States and Britain for persecuting colored people at home and disrespecting their religious beliefs.

    阿联宗教基金部长说
    阿拉伯人是一个团结整体
    新华社大马士革16日电　阿拉伯联合共和国宗教基金部长艾哈迈德·哈桑·巴库里昨天在荷姆斯举行的记者招待会上说，阿拉伯人民是一个万众一心为反对帝国主义而斗争的团结一致的整体。我们永远不会让帝国主义在我们中间制造不和和纠纷，或者让它们利用我们的宗教或教族问题。
    他说，西方帝国主义常常想在我国公民中制造仇恨和教族不和。不仅如此，帝国主义还想在基督教和伊斯兰教的信徒之间，甚至伊斯兰教各教派和团体之间制造纠纷。巴库里说，我们要铲除帝国主义留下的影响，因为它们认为我们是有色人种和奴隶，只想剥削和利用我们。他还谴责美国和英国迫害国内的有色人种和不尊重他们的宗教信仰。
