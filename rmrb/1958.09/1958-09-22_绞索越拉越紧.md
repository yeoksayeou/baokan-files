Dulles' speech at the United Nations General Assembly on September 18th, in which he falsely accused our country of being an "aggressor," is the height of shamelessness, a blatant distortion of the truth, and a vain attempt to deceive the world!

Since the resumption of the Sino-American ambassadorial talks, what kind of activities have the American aggressors been engaged in? They have been intensifying the concentration of armed forces in the Taiwan area, carrying out war provocations. American executioners bearing the title of general have even clamored about what they would do to the Chinese mainland. On the other hand, Dulles has actually counter-attacked our country at the United Nations General Assembly and put forward the absurd proposal of a so-called "ceasefire." This despicable and shameless act shows that the American aggressors do not even care about the most basic morality in the international community. It is not only a great slander against the Chinese people, but also a great slander against the people of the world! Foreign Minister Chen Yi's solemn statement once again tears off the human skin worn by these warmongers, allowing the people of the world to more clearly recognize the true face of this group of jackals; and warns Dulles that the Chinese people love peace, but are definitely not afraid of war.

No matter how Dulles distorts the truth and calls a stag a horse, the fact that Taiwan is Chinese territory and that the Chinese people are carrying out armed struggle with the Chiang Kai-shek group to liberate Taiwan and recover Jinmen and Matsu is China's internal affair is a truth recognized by the whole world. The United States has no reason to interfere. Dulles thinks he can deceive the world with one hand, but the facts are unforgiving. On this issue, all peace-loving people around the world, except for notorious accomplices like Syngman Rhee, condemn the United States in unison. "Condemned by a thousand, one dies without disease." The American aggressors should wake up and recognize their situation.

Foreign Minister Chen Yi's solemn declaration on behalf of the 600 million Chinese people is a representation of the will and determination of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have learned a lesson from the struggle against imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek group, that is, to deal with these rogues and bandits, we must be resolute and not harbor any illusions. The more resolutely you struggle, and the more you are not afraid of war, the more they will restrain themselves and be more honest. When we say this, we can do it. This is not intimidation, but a telling of Dulles and his ilk that 600 million people have this determination and this strength.

I would also like to remind Dulles and his ilk to do the math: We have fought on the Korean battlefield before. The strength of the Chinese people is not what it used to be, and the strength of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is not what it used to be; a soldier fighting for the defense of the motherland, for the defense of peace, and for justice is definitely not comparable to an American soldier forced to fight. The role of the same ton of steel, the same lathe, in the hands of the Chinese people in a socialist country is definitely not comparable to that in the United States under a brutal exploitative system; and you are completely isolated, even your own people are against you, while we have friends all over the world. It would be helpful to calculate this before competing.

Of course, from the perspective of Dulles and his ilk, he is only considering how to make the monopoly capitalists, arms dealers, and financial oligarchs rich, but it is also necessary to remind these guys that the war may not break out, but if the American aggressors insist on provoking a war, then the noose will only get tighter and tighter, and what awaits them is complete and thorough failure and destruction!

    绞索越拉越紧

    杜勒斯9月18日在联合国大会上的发言，竟然反诬我国为“侵略者”，真是无耻之尤，真是颠倒黑白，妄想一手掩尽天下耳目！
    自从中美大使级会谈恢复以来，美国侵略者做的是些什么勾当呢？那就是变本加厉地在台湾地区结集武装力量，进行战争挑衅，那些挂着将军头衔的美国刽子手还扬言要对中国大陆如何如何。另一方面，杜勒斯竟然在联合国大会上对我国反咬一口，并且提出所谓“停火”的荒谬主张。这种卑鄙无耻的行径，说明美国侵略者连国际间最起码的道德都不顾了，不仅是对中国人民的绝大污蔑，也是对全世界人民的绝大污蔑！我国陈毅外长的严正声明再一次把这些战争贩子所披着的人皮撕下来，让全世界人民更加清楚地认识这群豺狼的本来面目；并且警告杜勒斯，中国人民爱好和平，但决不怕战争。
    任凭杜勒斯如何颠倒黑白，指鹿为马，但台湾是中国的领土，中国人民为了解放台湾、收复金门、马祖，同蒋介石集团进行武装斗争是中国的内政，这一真理是全世界所公认的。美国没有任何理由可以干涉。杜勒斯以为一手可以掩尽天下耳目，但事实答复是不容情的，在这一事件上，除了像李承晚这样的臭名远扬的帮凶等外，全世界一切爱好和平的人民都异口同声地谴责美国。“千夫所指，无疾而死”，美国侵略者应当清醒一点，认识自己的处境。
    陈毅外长代表中国六亿人民所作的庄严宣告，正是中国人民意志和决心的表示。中国人民从与帝国主义和蒋介石集团的斗争中学到了一条经验，那就是对付这些流氓、强盗，必须坚决，不能存丝毫幻想，你越是坚决地斗争，不惜一战，他们反而会收敛一些，老实一些。我们这样说到，就能做到，不是恫吓，而是告诉杜勒斯之流，六亿人民有这个决心而且也有这个力量的。
    我还想提醒杜勒斯之流，请他们算一下账：我们在朝鲜战场上曾经较量过的，现在中国人民的力量不是那时所能比的，现在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量也不是那时所能比的；同样一个士兵，为保卫祖国、为保卫和平、为正义而战的中国战士决不是被迫作战的美国士兵所能比的，同样一吨钢、同样一台车床，在社会主义国家的中国人民手里所发挥的作用决不是在残酷的剥削制度下的美国所能比的；还有你们是彻底孤立，连本国人民都反对你们，我们是朋友遍世界。在较量以前，算一算这笔账不无好处的。
    当然，从杜勒斯之流讲来，他考虑的只是如何使垄断资本家、军火商和金融寡头等发财的问题，但也要提醒这些家伙一下，这场战争不爆发则已，如果美国侵略者一定要挑起战争，那末只是绞索愈拉愈紧，等待他们的是全部、彻底的失败与毁灭！
