　　The Broad Masses Actively Assist Public Security Organs in Investigation
　　Jiangsu and Zhejiang Capture a Batch of Secret Agents

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 30th. Public security organs in various parts of Jiangsu Province, with the active assistance of the broad masses, have recently successively captured a batch of secret agents dispatched by the "National Security Bureau Intelligence Bureau" and "Central Committee Society" of the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret service.

These secret agents had all undergone specialized training by the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret service. After infiltrating the Jiangsu area, they conspired to blow up our factories, warehouses, railway bridges, collect our military, political, economic and other intelligence, and develop secret service organizations. Kuang Dexing, a secret agent belonging to the "National Security Bureau Intelligence Bureau," fled to Taiwan before liberation. From 1953, he was sponsored by the former "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics" of the Chiang gang secret service to enter the "Guerrilla Cadre Training Class of the Ministry of National Defense" to receive demolition training. In June 1956, he received sixteen specialized training courses in demolition, defection, intelligence, and "psychological warfare" in the "Special Training Room of the National Security Bureau Intelligence Bureau" and interned in Hong Kong. After Kuang committed the crime of sneaking into the mainland, he actively spied on demolition targets, plotting to blow up our warehouses and bridges, and developed his uncle, Kuang Quanhai, to participate in the secret service organization. Kuang tried every possible means to contact our demobilized soldiers, conspiring to elicit military intelligence such as the location, equipment, and number of our troops. You Yongxiang, the station chief of the Chiang gang’s "Central Committee Society Songjiang Intelligence Station," served as a branch captain of the Chiang gang’s Three Youth League before liberation. He fled to Hong Kong in the early days of liberation and joined a secret service organization. In February of this year, he accepted the Chiang gang's secret service mission of "building the party behind enemy lines" and collecting intelligence. After sneaking into Songjiang, he actively developed secret service organizations, taught the secret agents he developed the method of secret writing, and ordered them to widely carry out so-called "building the party behind enemy lines" and collecting intelligence and other secret service activities. Lu Kuanmeng, a secret agent dispatched by the "Central Committee Society," was a member of the Three Youth League. He fled to Hong Kong before liberation and joined a secret service organization, serving as "Deputy Director of the Wujin Branch of the China Youth Anti-Communist and Anti-Russian Youth League" and other counter-revolutionary positions. This year, Lu accepted the mission dispatched by the Chiang gang's "Central Committee Society" and sneaked into Jiangsu from Hong Kong, also conspiring to carry out so-called "building the party behind enemy lines" and other counter-revolutionary activities.

After being arrested, these secret agents confessed to their crimes. They have now been transferred by the public security organs to the procuratorial organs for handling according to law.

This newspaper reports that the public security organs in the Zhoushan and Jinhua areas of Zhejiang Province, with the assistance of the broad masses, recently cracked two cases of secret agents dispatched by the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret service. Secret agents Yu Minfang (female) and Lou Mingfu have been arrested.

Secret agent Yu Minfang (female) was the "Zhoushan Islands Special Commissioner" sent by the Hong Kong secret service of the Second Department of the Chiang gang's Ministry of National Defense to Zhoushan. In mid-June of this year, she sneaked back to Dinghai in the name of "returning home to visit relatives" in an attempt to collect military intelligence on our Zhoushan Islands and other places.

Secret agent Lou Mingfu joined a secret service organization in Macau at the end of 1956 and accepted the dispatch of the secret service organization to sneak back to his hometown of Dongyang in January last year to carry out counter-revolutionary activities.
