Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th – According to the Korean Central News Agency: Evidence of the inhumane atrocities committed by the U.S. invading army against the Korean people during the Korean War continues to be discovered.

More than two hundred bodies of civilians massacred by the U.S. military during the war have recently been discovered in Guanshan-ri, Eunryul County, South Hwanghae Province, Korea. When the U.S. military occupied this county during the Korean War, they massacred more than 13,000 peaceful residents, including more than 400 in Guanshan-ri alone. The atrocities of the U.S. military have aroused great anger among the local people.

These two hundred or more bodies were found in a deep cave on the back mountain of the village. These bodies, which had been submerged in groundwater for seven years, had become fossilized, with their limbs still bound by ropes and copper wires. Among them were more than fifty bodies of women, and many children's skulls. Many of the bodies had holes in their skulls from bullets and bayonet wounds. Sticks and bayonets engraved with the letters "USA" were also found in this cave. On September 7, the people of Guanshan-ri held a funeral for these two hundred or more innocent civilians who were killed by the U.S. invading army.

    旧恨激起新仇
    朝鲜又发现二百多具被美军残杀的平民尸体
    新华社平壤10日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：美国侵略军在朝鲜战争中屠杀朝鲜人民的惨无人道的暴行的罪证仍然在不断地被发现。
    朝鲜黄海南道殷栗郡冠山里最近又发现了二百多具在战时被美军残杀的平民的尸体。美军在朝鲜战争中侵占这个郡时曾经屠杀一万三千多名和平居民，仅在冠山里就屠杀了四百多名。美军的暴行引起了当地人民的极大愤怒。
    这二百多具尸体是在村庄的后山上很深的地洞中发现的。这些七年来沉浸在地下水里的尸体变得像化石一样，尸体四肢还捆着绳子和铜线。其中有五十多具妇女的尸体，还有许多儿童的头骨。许多尸体的头颅上有被子弹射穿和刺刀刺伤的洞。在这个地洞里还发现有刻有“USA”字样的棍棒和刺刀。冠山里的群众9月7日为这二百多名被美国侵略军杀害的无辜平民举行了葬礼。
