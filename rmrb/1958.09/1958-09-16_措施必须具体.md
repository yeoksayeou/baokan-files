    Measures Must Be Specific
    Kong Sang
    In order to realize the plan of producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year, enterprises in various regions have proposed advanced targets, and the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses has also been boosted. The current problem is to come up with practical measures to ensure the complete realization of advanced targets.
    Plans are the program of action, and measures are the guarantee. Measures follow the plan, and both the plan and the measures must be specific; if the plan is vague, the measures will inevitably be vague as well. Take steel production as an example. If a region or an enterprise only has a vague plan from the leading organs, without allocating the plan to each grassroots unit or group and stipulating that they complete it on time, then it will be difficult to effectively organize the broad masses to charge forward for the realization of the plan. Conversely, it will be different if it is like Handan area, Chengde area, and Tang County in Hebei Province. These places not only have an advanced steel production plan from the leading organs, but also allocate the production tasks to the grassroots units in a quantitative, qualitative, and timely manner, determining how much each region, each unit, and each furnace should produce each day, each month, and by the end of the year, and then check, organize evaluations on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. Because the plan is specific to each furnace and each day, the fighting goals of the workers and masses are very clear. In order to ensure the completion of the plan every day, people have to formulate various specific measures to ensure the supply of raw materials, ensure that one link is connected to another, step by step, and organize rhythmic production. Put the advanced plan on a reliable basis.
    When the plan and measures are specific, it is also easier to organize inspection and evaluation. The enthusiasm of the masses has been boosted, advanced targets and measures have been formulated, and the task of the leadership is to diligently inspect, discover and solve new problems in a timely manner, and strengthen weak links. The leadership must check the plan, check the measures, check the enthusiasm, and check the collaboration on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. After taking each step, we must summarize the experience of that step, and after experiencing an event, we must find out the laws of that event, and if we find good experience, we must immediately organize its promotion, and turn a few high-yield "satellites" into a large-scale harvest. In this way, our road can become wider and wider, our steps can become bigger and bigger, and we can jump higher and higher, and the task of 10.7 million tons can be guaranteed to be completed or over-fulfilled.

    措施必须具体
    孔桑
    为了实现今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的计划，各地企业都提出了先进的指标，干部和群众的干劲也都鼓起来了。现在的问题就是要拿出切切实实的措施来，才能保证先进指标的完全实现。
    计划是行动的纲领，措施是保证。措施是跟着计划走的，计划和措施，都必须具体；计划是笼笼统统的，措施也必然是笼笼统统的。拿钢铁生产来说吧。要是一个地区或者一个企业，只是领导机关有一个笼统的计划，而没有把计划分配到每一个基层单位或小组去，并规定他们按时完成，那末就很难有效地组织广大的群众为实现计划，冲锋陷阵。相反，如果像河北省邯郸地区，承德地区和唐县那样，就会是另一种样子。这些地方不仅领导机关有一个先进的钢铁生产计划，并且把生产任务定量、定质、定时地分配到基层单位去，确定每一个地区、每一个单位、每一个炉子，每天生产多少，每月生产多少，到年底生产多少，然后按日、按旬、按月检查，组织评比。由于计划具体到每一个炉子和每一天，职工群众的奋斗目标非常明确。为了保证每天完成计划，人们就不得不订出各种具体措施来保证原材料的供应，保证一环套一环，一步接一步，组织有节奏的生产。把先进计划放在可靠的基础上。
    计划和措施具体了，也便于组织检查和评比。群众的干劲鼓起来了，先进的指标和措施订出来了，领导的任务就是勤于检查，及时发现和解决新问题，加强薄弱环节。领导必须按日、按旬、按月查计划、查措施、查干劲、查协作。走完一步要总结一步的经验，经历一事要找出一事的规律，发现好经验要立即组织推广，把少数高产“卫星”变为大面积丰收。这样，我们的道路才能越走越宽，步子越走越大，越跳越高，一千零七十万吨的任务就能保证完成或超额完成。
