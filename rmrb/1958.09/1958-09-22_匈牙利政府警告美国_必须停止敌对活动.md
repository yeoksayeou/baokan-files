Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 20th September - The Information Department of the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs today delivered a note to the United States Chargé d'Affaires ad interim in Budapest. The note pointed out that the slanderous propaganda conducted by the U.S. government against Hungary, and the activities aimed at overthrowing the existing social system in Hungary, are contrary to Hungary's policy of peace and cooperation with all countries.

The note stated that the Hungarian government has to remind the U.S. government and its minister in Budapest of the following facts: The U.S. government and other American organizations are continuing to intensify their hostile espionage and sabotage conspiracies against Hungary, which have been going on for several years, and are repeatedly attempting to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs.

The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the U.S. government is not only using some international organizations to attack Hungary but is also driving other countries to take similar actions.

The note stated that the Hungarian government spokesman's statement on September 13 this year clearly pointed out that the U.S. has adopted a hostile policy against Hungary, and the illegal activities carried out by the U.S. government in Hungary are consistent with its activities in the international arena. The Hungarian government condemns these practices by the United States and lodges a strong protest.

The note said that the U.S. government calls Hungary a "country behind the Iron Curtain," and insists that Hungary does not establish normal relations with other countries. However, on the contrary, it is the U.S. that is hindering the development of relations between the two countries.

The note concluded by saying that the Hungarian government is willing to restore normal relations between the two countries and expects the U.S. government to change its attitude. However, an indispensable condition for resolving relations between the two countries is that they must respect each other and not interfere in each other's internal affairs. Therefore, the U.S. government must immediately stop hostile propaganda and all espionage and sabotage activities against Hungary.

    匈牙利政府警告美国
    必须停止敌对活动
    新华社布达佩斯20日电　匈牙利外交部新闻司发布消息说，匈牙利外交部今天向美国驻布达佩斯临时代办递交了一分照会。照会指出，美国政府对匈牙利所进行的诽谤性的宣传和以推翻匈牙利现存的社会制度为目的的活动，是同匈牙利的和平和与一切国家合作的政策相抵触的。
    照会说，匈牙利政府不得不提醒美国政府和它的驻布达佩斯公使注意如下事实：美国政府和美国其他组织正在继续加强其几年来反对匈牙利的敌对的间谍活动和破坏阴谋，一再企图干涉匈牙利的内政。
    匈牙利外交部认为，美国政府不但正在利用一些国际组织来攻击匈牙利而且还在驱使其他国家采取类似的行动。
    照会说，匈牙利政府发言人在今年9月13日的声明中已清楚地指出了美国对匈牙利所采取的这种敌对的政策，美国政府在匈牙利所进行的这种非法活动是和它在国际上的活动相一致的。匈牙利政府谴责美国这些作法并且提出强硬的抗议。
    照会说，美国政府把匈牙利称做“铁幕后面的国家”，硬说匈牙利不和其他国家建立正常关系。但是，与此相反，正是美国妨碍了两国关系的发展。
    照会最后说，匈牙利政府愿意恢复两国的正常关系，也期待美国政府改变态度。但是，解决两国关系不可缺少的条件是：必须互相尊重，互不干涉内政。因此，美国政府必须立即停止反对匈牙利的敌对宣传和一切间谍破坏活动。
