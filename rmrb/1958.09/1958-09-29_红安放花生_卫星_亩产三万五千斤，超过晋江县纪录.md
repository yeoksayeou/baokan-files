Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 27th - A plot of 1.058 mu of peanuts in Annan Brigade, Yonghong People's Commune, Hong'an County, Hubei Province, yielded a total of 37,478 jin and 5 liang of dry peanuts, with a per-mu yield of 35,423 jin and 12 liang. This is 8,455 jin more than the high-yield record of 26,968 jin and 11 liang per mu created by militiamen in Jinjing Township, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province.

Hong'an County has always been known throughout the country for its abundant peanut production. Last year, the county's peanut yield per mu ranked first in the country, averaging 600 jin per mu. Therefore, some people at the time believed that the potential had been almost fully tapped, and that increasing production had reached its limit. However, Dai Xiuli, director of Annan Agricultural Cooperative, Li Dekun, deputy director, Dai Qiren, secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, Dai Qichang, leader of the 17th production team, and other well-known labor models in the province, had different views. They believed that the potential for increasing production was still very large, so they discussed creating a high-yield peanut experimental plot, planning for a yield of 22,000 jin per mu. These miracle-makers painstakingly managed this experimental plot, which had poor soil quality (locally called "horse bone land"). They plowed and harrowed it six times, with a plowing depth of nine inches to one foot. The base fertilizer was applied in layers, totaling 2,000 dan of pond mud, 500 dan of cattle manure, 80 jin of superphosphate, 30 jin of bone meal, 20 jin of gypsum, and 5 dan of grass ash. In addition, foliar phosphorus fertilizer was applied three times. A total of 400 jin of seeds were sown on this plot, with a row spacing of three and a half inches and a plant spacing of one inch. Only a month after the peanuts emerged from the soil, the entire plot was covered. This brought new problems to field management, but the masters of the experimental field solved them one by one. In order to ensure regular ventilation, they used bamboo poles to separate the peanuts every day; when cultivating the soil, they scattered fine soil brought from afar by hand.

Because these peanuts grew particularly well, people had been very concerned about their yield for a long time. When the news of the harvest on the 24th spread, some people carried hoes, some held red flags, and some carried baskets, all rushing to the scene. The 1.058 mu of peanuts, except for 0.1 mu that was not dug and was specially reserved for visiting representatives from other places, took the entire day to dig.

When the field was harvested, Wang Yanchun, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, Zhang Hua, Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Committee, Ren Aisheng, Deputy Director of the Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Department, Ma Youcai, County Head of Hong'an County, and others, all rushed to the scene to watch and congratulate. Wang Yulin, Secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat, technical cadres from the County Agricultural Bureau, and representatives of the commune members participated in the acceptance from beginning to end.

    红安放花生“卫星”
    亩产三万五千斤，超过晋江县纪录
    新华社武汉27日电  湖北省红安县永红人民公社安南大队的一点零五八亩花生，共收干花生三万七千四百七十八斤五两，亩产三万五千四百二十三斤十二两。这比福建省晋江县金井乡民兵们创造的亩产二万六千九百六十八斤十一两的高产纪录还多八千四百五十五斤。
    红安县历来以花生丰产闻名全国。去年，这个县花生亩产量居全国第一位，平均亩产六百斤。因此，当时有些人认为潜力挖得差不多了，增产已经到顶。但是全省著名的劳动模范、安南农业社主任戴修礼、副主任李德坤、共青团支部书记戴启仁、十七生产队长戴启长等人却有着不同看法。他们认为增产潜力还是大得很，便商量着搞一块花生高产试验地，规划亩产二万二千斤。这些创造奇迹的人们，对这块土质较差（当地叫马骨地）的试验地，进行了苦心经营。他们先后犁、耙了六次，耕深达九寸到一尺。底肥分层共施塘泥二千担、牛栏粪五百担、过磷酸钙八十斤、骨粉三十斤、石膏二十斤、草木灰五担。另外，又根外施磷肥三次。这块地共下种四百斤，行距三寸半，蔸距一寸。花生出土才一个来月，就把整块地铺得满满的。这给田间管理工作带来了新的问题，但是试验田的主人却一一解决了。为了经常通风，他们每天用竹杆把花生拨开；培土壅蔸时，他们就把远处挑来的细土用手撒下去。
    由于这块花生长的特别好，老早人们就很关心它的产量。24日收获的消息一传开，有的人扛着扒锄，有的人拿着红旗，有的人挑着箩筐，都纷纷赶来了。这一点零五八亩花生，除留下零点一亩未挖专门留作外地代表参观以外，整整挖了大半天。
    这块田收获时，中共湖北省委书记处书记王延春、省委副秘书长张华、省委农工部副部长任爱生、红安县县长马友才等，都赶到现场观看和祝贺。县委书记处书记王玉林、县农业局技术干部以及社员代表自始至终参加了验收。
