Time Has Not Yet Arrived, But Has Already Become History
Chen Xingya
Propaganda Minister of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

The No. 1 Blast Furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel (WISCO) was completed ahead of schedule on September 13th, and the first furnace of molten iron flowed out. Since then, it has entered the era of being a mother, producing pig iron day and night. Now, a mass rally of tens of thousands of people is held to celebrate its victory. This is truly a day of double happiness. At the same time, something that has become a historical irony is deeply imprinted on people's minds. That is, some spokesmen of Western imperialism expressed doubt and disbelief about whether WISCO's No. 1 Blast Furnace could produce iron by the end of this year. It is said that they even put a big question mark in their newspapers.

Putting a question mark means disbelief, waiting and seeing, and awaiting the sequel and waiting for the facts. The implication is that they are watching the time, and if the No. 1 Blast Furnace fails to produce iron by then, they can gloat, spread rumors and slander, and reveal the true colors of the spokesmen of imperialism. However, the development of objective facts always goes against the subjective wishes of these spokesmen of imperialism. Let us calculate. Comparing the time when WISCO's No. 1 Blast Furnace produced iron with the time they predicted it "could not" produce iron, the three months and eighteen days are already a historical ironic laughing stock. In this way, the bewitching fog set up by the spokesmen of imperialism has been dispelled! For the Chinese people, this cannot but be a miracle; for the spokesmen of imperialism, it cannot but be a slap in the face.

It is not surprising that the spokesmen of imperialism can arbitrarily fabricate rumors, slander, and spread doubts about something that is clearly a real thing. However, there is a reason for this, which more or less represents the imperialists' view of the Chinese people. From the Opium War to the overthrow of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, for hundreds of years, they have never taken the Chinese people seriously. They cannot understand, and it is impossible for them to understand, the tremendous potential, soaring enthusiasm, and infinite wisdom of the liberated Chinese people in building the socialist motherland. This is one point. Secondly, in the era of capitalist development, in the history of their steel industry spanning decades or hundreds of years, it has never been possible to build a large-scale, modern, world-class blast furnace at such a rapid speed. They believe that things that are difficult or even impossible for them to do, the Chinese people will certainly not be able to do. They look at the vigorous new Chinese people with the decadent eyes of imperialism. Of course, they can only run into walls everywhere.

From this, we can easily draw a truth: that no matter what the imperialists say, whether they believe it or not, the Chinese people must follow their own path, that is, the path of the Party's general line for building socialism. Things that the imperialists think are difficult or even impossible to do, the liberated Chinese people can completely do, and do it faster and better.

    时间还没有到来，就已经成为历史
    中共武汉钢铁公司委员会宣传部长  陈醒亚
    武钢一号高炉，于9月13日提前建成，流出了第一炉铁水，从此，它就进入了日夜生产生铁的母亲时代，现在又举行几万人的大会，来庆祝它的胜利，这真是一个喜事重重的日子。与此同时，有个已经变成了历史讽刺的事情，深深的记忆在人们心上，这就是，有些西方帝国主义的代言人，对于武钢一号高炉今年年底能否出铁表示怀疑、不相信，据说，还在他们报纸上打上了一个大问号。
    打问号，是意味着不相信、等着瞧，听候下文，等待事实的意思。弦外之意，就是他们注视着时间，到时候，如果一号高炉不能出铁的话，他们就可以幸灾乐祸地大做文章，造谣污蔑，显露一下帝国主义代言人的本色。但是，客观事实的发展，总是走向这些帝国主义代言人的主观愿望的反面。我们计算一下，把武钢一号高炉出铁时间，同他们预计“不能”出铁时间对比，还需三个月又十八天的时间，就已经成为历史讽刺的笑柄。这样，帝国主义的代言人所设想的迷魂阵，被打散了！这对中国人民来说，不能不是一个奇迹；对帝国主义的代言人来说，不能不是一个耳光。
    明明是一件实实在在的事情，帝国主义的代言人，都可以任意造谣中伤，随便散布疑云，这本来没有什么奇怪的。但是，事出有因，这多少代表帝国主义者对中国人的一种看法。他们从鸦片战争起，到蒋介石的反动统治被打倒止，成百年来，一直都不把中国人民放在眼里。对于解放了的中国人民，在建设祖国社会主义的巨大潜力，冲天干劲，无穷智慧，更是没法理解的，也不可能理解的。这是一。其二，在资本主义的发展时代，他们钢铁工业的几十年、成百年的历史上，能够用这么快的速度，建成一座大型的、现代化的、世界第一流的高炉，是从来没有过的，他们就认为，他们很难办到的事情，甚至不可能办到的事情，中国人民也一定不能办到。他们是以腐朽的帝国主义眼光，来看生气蓬勃的新中国人民，当然，他们只好到处碰壁。
    从这里，我们不难得出一条真理：即不管帝国主义说什么，不管他们相信不相信，中国人民要走自己的路，即走党的建设社会主义总路线的路。帝国主义认为很难办到，甚至永远办不到的事情，解放了的中国人民完全能够办到，而且办得更快更好。
