Xinhua News Agency, 11th - The warnings of the Chinese and Soviet leaders to the American aggressors have aroused tremendous cheers among the masses of people across the country. People have expressed their sincere support for Chairman Mao's incisive analysis and solemn appeal regarding the domestic and international situation in his speech at the Supreme State Conference, and they have warmly welcomed Chairman Khrushchev's letter to Eisenhower expressing support for the Chinese people.

As the leaders of the two countries stated in their statements, the people of the powerful socialist camp and the victorious Chinese people possess an unparalleled revolutionary heroism and have never taken a handful of imperialist elements seriously. This spirit of fearless heroism can also be fully evidenced in the bold statements made by people in various places. Shi Baozhen, an advanced producer at the Anhui No. 1 Textile Factory in Hefei, said: "US imperialism has eyes but fails to recognize Mount Tai. It was a defeated foe at the hands of the Chinese and Korean people. Today, China has the sympathy and assistance of the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world. If it does not abandon its aggressive ambitions, we will definitely strike it down into the Pacific Ocean." Chen Zuyou, a member of the Wudongzha People's Commune in Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, said: "The people of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are united as one. If US imperialism dares to risk launching a war, we will eliminate it like we eliminate pests." Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the Zhejiang East Front unanimously stated that the US Seventh Fleet cannot frighten us. If it dares to come, we will smash it to pieces. Soldiers who liberated Yijiangshan Island even wrote a quick-rhyme poem to express their contempt for the imperialists. The poem says: "American robbers overestimate themselves, monkeys trying to jump out of Buddha's palm, peanuts, dates and honey (referring to gunshots and bullets) and the South Sea water, let's see if they dare to taste it!"

Chairman Mao's statement that the American aggressors are putting a noose around their own necks has become a common saying among the masses these days. People are infinitely excited by this profound metaphor put forward by Chairman Mao and are determined to be the executioners who tighten the noose and strangle US imperialism to death. Yu Shaotang, a senior engineer at the Shenyang May 3rd Factory, said: "If US imperialism does not repent and rein in its horses early, we will tighten the noose it has put around its own neck until we strangle it to death." Ma Chonggong, an ironworker at the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Plant, said: "From Chairman Mao's speech, it can be clearly recognized that the establishment of many military bases abroad by US imperialism does not demonstrate its strength; on the contrary, it shows that US imperialism is already on the gallows and is on the verge of death."

Khrushchev's warning to Eisenhower that an invasion of China is an invasion of the Soviet Union has given the Chinese people tremendous encouragement and support. People sincerely thank the Soviet brother people for this noble proletarian internationalist friendship. Guo Shaojiang, a national model worker and worker at the Nanjing Chenguang Machinery Factory, said: "Comrade Khrushchev's letter is a great support to the Chinese people from the Soviet people and a head-on blow to the US imperialists. We must accelerate the expansion of our factory into a heavy machinery plant and produce more rolling mills and various heavy machine tools to strike back at the American aggressors." Ye Yongda, deputy director of the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Xiamen, said: "Eisenhower and Dulles should carefully read Comrade Khrushchev's letter. If they remain obdurate and do not accept the warnings of the Soviet and Chinese governments, they will be crushed under the iron fists of the powerful Chinese and Soviet people."

The joyous and inspiring emotions aroused by the statements of the Chinese and Soviet leaders among the broad masses of people have rapidly transformed into a powerful material force on the production front. People have taken increasing production as the best gift to respond to the call of the leaders. After listening to the broadcast of Chairman Mao's speech, more than 40 workers in the team of Wang Benkuan, an electric furnace steelmaking worker at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, were full of energy and created a new record of shortening the smelting time by 70 minutes, producing seven tons of steel more in eight hours. More than 40 workers in the electric locomotive workshop of the Shenyang May 3rd Factory were originally on vacation on the 9th. After seeing Chairman Mao's speech in the newspaper, they immediately went to the factory to contribute their labor and completed the planned task six days ahead of schedule by manufacturing an inner pressure rod for a motor impeller fan made of wood plastic instead of aluminum.

    全国人民欢呼中苏两国领袖对美帝国主义的警告
    决心要做拉紧绞索的执刑人
    新华社11日讯　中苏两国领袖对美国侵略者的警告，在全国各地人民群众中引起了巨大的欢呼。人们对于毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话中对国内外形势所作的精辟分析和庄严号召，表示竭诚拥护；对于赫鲁晓夫主席给艾森豪威尔的信件中所表示的对我国人民的支持，表示热烈欢迎。
    正如两国领袖在声明中所表示的，强大的社会主义阵营各国人民和胜利了的中国人民，具有着无比磅礴的革命英雄主义气概，是从来都不把一小撮帝国主义分子放在眼下的。这种大无畏的英雄气概，在各地人民群众所发出的一些豪言壮语中也可以找到充分的证明。合肥市安徽第一纺织厂先进生产者石宝珍说：“美帝国主义有眼不识泰山，它是中朝人民手下的败将。中国今天有苏联和全世界爱好和平人民的同情和援助，如果他不放弃侵略的野心，我们一定要把它打下太平洋。”浙江省慈溪县五洞闸人民公社社员陈祖尧说：“以苏联为首的社会主义国家人民团结一条心，如果美帝国主义敢冒险发动战争，我们要像消灭害虫一样消灭它。”中国人民解放军浙东前线部队的官兵们一致表示，美国第七舰队是吓不倒我们的，它如果敢来，定叫它粉身碎骨。解放一江山岛的部队战士还写了一首快板诗，来表示他们对于帝国主义者的蔑视。这首诗说：“美国强盗不自量，猢狲想跳如来掌，花生蜜枣（指枪炮子弹）南海水，看它敢来尝一尝！”
    毛主席讲话中所说的美国侵略者把绞索套在自己脖子上的话，这些天来成了在广大群众中普遍流传的口头语。人们都为毛主席提出的这个深刻的比喻而感到无限兴奋，决心要做拉紧绞索绞死美帝国主义的执刑人。沈阳市五三工厂老工程师虞绍唐说：“美帝国主义如果不及早幡然悔悟，悬崖勒马，我们就拉紧他自己套在脖子上的绞索，直到绞死它才松手。”济南汽车制造厂铁工马崇功说：“从毛主席的讲话里可以明显地认识到，美帝国主义在国外建立许多军事基地，不是说明他的强大，相反地说明美帝国主义已经上了绞架，已经死到临头了。”
    赫鲁晓夫主席向艾森豪威尔提出的侵犯中国就是侵犯苏联的警告，使我国人民感到了巨大的鼓舞和支持。人们衷心地感谢苏联兄弟人民这种崇高的无产阶级国际主义的友谊。全国劳动模范、南京晨光机器厂工人郭绍江说：“赫鲁晓夫同志的信是苏联人民对我国人民极大的支持，是对美帝国主义者一个迎头的痛击，我们要加速把工厂扩建成一座重型机械厂，生产更多的轧钢机和各种重型机床，来回击美国侵略者。”厦门市“五一”农业社副社长叶永达说：“艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯应该好好地读一读赫鲁晓夫同志的信，如果他们仍然执迷不悟，不接受苏联政府和我国政府的警告，必将在强大的中苏人民的铁拳下被打得粉碎。”
    中苏两国领袖的声明在广大人民群众中所引起的欢欣鼓舞的情绪，已经迅速地转化为生产战线上的强大的物质力量。人们纷纷以增加生产的实际行动作为他们响应领袖号召的最好的礼物。太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢工人王本宽所在的小组四十多名工人，听了毛主席讲话的广播后，大家干劲十足，创造了缩短冶炼时间七十分钟的新纪录，在八小时内多炼了七吨钢。沈阳市五三工厂电机车间的四十多名工人本来在九号这天休假，当他们看到报纸上登载的毛主席的讲话后，立即到工厂献工，当晚就制成了用木制塑料代替铝质的电机叶轮风扇内压杆，提前六天完成了预定的计划。
