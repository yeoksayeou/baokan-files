Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, 16th – Teachers, students, and staff of Xiamen No. 3 Middle School and Xiamen University, who have suffered from the frenzied shelling by the Chiang bandit troops, are taking various measures to continue teaching and working, determined to transform grief and indignation into strength. They will use practical actions such as strengthening the struggle against the enemy, improving teaching quality and scientific research results, and vigorously running factories to thank the people across the country for their concern and condolences, and to protest the atrocities of the Chiang bandit troops.

The teachers and students of Xiamen No. 3 Middle School, where fifteen teachers and students were killed and injured by American-made Chiang bandit shells and whose offices and some dormitories and classrooms were damaged, in addition to using their deep hatred for the enemy to accuse and expose the enemy's ferocious face at various rallies in the city, and working harder to produce and support the liberation of Taiwan, also put forward militant slogans such as "Using superior teaching results, always be ready to respond to the call of the motherland, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating all coastal islands, and avenge the victims of the teachers and students". On the second day after suffering shelling by the Chiang bandit troops, all of the more than six hundred teachers and students at the school mobilized to repair school buildings and new teaching places day and night, dig air-raid and artillery shelters, and all signed up to join the militia regiment. On the 9th, they continued to persist in teaching by adopting methods such as dispersed classes, while at the same time starting military training. Huang Tianshou and Lin Yaru, first-year junior high school students who were wounded in their arms and bodies by Chiang bandit shells, returned to school to attend classes one after another before their wounds had healed.

More than four thousand teachers and students of Xiamen University, where three students and teaching assistants were successively wounded by Chiang bandit shells, are also enthusiastically carrying out teaching, scientific research, and factory operations according to the original plan. In addition to adhering to the teaching policy of combining education and labor, and continuing to go to factories and rural areas in batches to participate in industrial and agricultural labor production, conducting on-site teaching and scientific research, they also have more than 130 iron smelting plants, sulfuric acid plants, cement plants, refractory brick plants, etc., that have been established and are being established around the school. They have successively manufactured more than 80 kinds of products while building factories and producing. Now they have decided to manufacture dozens of new products before National Day as a gift for National Day, and use practical actions to打击 [dǎ jī] strike, hit, attack, crack down on the enemy. Wu Simin, a professor in the Department of Chemistry, Lin Rongji, a staff member, and Hong Xiangling, a student, after working day and night amid the sound of gunfire, successfully trial-produced soft films from wheat straw on the 10th ahead of schedule. Various scientific research work carried out by teachers and students of various departments to combine production and implement the policy of emphasizing the present and belittling the past are also being accelerated day and night in laboratories, air-raid shelters, factories, and rural areas. The Xiamen University Militia Division, newly established amid the sound of gunfire, is making intensive military training during breaks and gymnastics, ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, abandon their pens and join the army to go to the front line to kill the enemy.

    化悲愤为力量　向敌人讨血债
    厦门大学和第三中学坚持教学
    新华社厦门16日电　遭受蒋贼军疯狂炮击的厦门第三中学、厦门大学师生员工，正采取各种措施，继续坚持教学和工作，决心化悲愤为力量，用加强对敌斗争，提高教学质量和科学研究成果、大办工厂等实际行动，来答谢全国各地人民的关怀和慰问，抗议蒋贼军的暴行。
    有十五个师生被美制蒋贼军炮弹打死打伤，办公室和一部分宿舍、教室被打坏的厦门第三中学师生，除了用对敌人的刻骨仇恨在全市各种集会上控诉、揭发敌人的凶残面目，更加努力生产、支援解放台湾外，还提出了“用优越的教学成绩、时刻准备响应祖国的号召，支援解放军解放沿海一切岛屿，为受害师生报仇”等战斗口号，在遭受蒋贼军炮击的第二天，在校的六百多名师生都全部动员起来，日夜赶修校舍和新的教学场所，挖防空防炮洞，并全体报名参加民兵团，在9日就一面采用分散上课等办法继续坚持教学，一面开始进行军事训练。手臂和身上被蒋贼军炮弹打伤的初中一年级学生黄添寿、林亚汝等伤口还未痊愈，就相继出院回校听课。
    有三个学生、教学辅助员先后被蒋贼军炮弹打伤的厦门大学四千多名师生，也都按原订计划热火朝天地开展教学、科学研究和办厂等工作。他们除了坚持教育和劳动相结合的教学方针，照常分批下厂下乡结合参加工、农业劳动生产，进行现场教学和科学调查研究工作外，还在学校周围已兴办和正在兴办的有一百三十多座炼铁厂、硫酸厂、水泥厂、耐火砖厂等工厂，并在边建厂边生产中先后制造出了八十多种产品，现在他们决定要在国庆节前再制造几十种新产品作为国庆节的献礼，用实际行动打击敌人。化学系教授吴思敏、职工林荣基、学生洪香玲等在炮火声中，经过日夜苦战后，已提前在10日用麦秸试制软片成功。各系师生为结合生产和贯彻执行厚今薄古方针而进行的各种科学调查研究工作，也正日日夜夜地在实验室、防空防炮洞里和工厂、农村中加速进行着。在炮火声中新成立的厦门大学民兵师，正在利用空隙和体操等时间，加紧进行军事训练，随时准备响应祖国的号召，投笔从戎上前线杀敌。
