Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 13th. After the realization of people's communes in the rural areas of Shanxi Province, the more than 20,000 agricultural cooperatives in the province have been merged and transformed into 890 people's communes from early August to early September. Mountainous communes generally consist of around 2,000 households, semi-mountainous and semi-plain areas mostly consist of around 4,000 households, and plain areas mostly consist of around 10,000 households. At present, most communes are rectifying their organizations and establishing new rules and regulations. Some communes have already held commune member congresses, elected commune cadres, and, based on the characteristics of the communes, deployed the work for the most recent period.

In this magnificent movement of merging large cooperatives and transforming them into communes, Party organizations at all levels in Shanxi Province mobilized and organized the masses to engage in extensive airing of views, big debates, and wholeheartedly supported the urgent demands of the masses by standing at the forefront of the movement. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has successively deployed the work of developing people's communes in various places three times, and organized cadres to conduct pilot projects, planning, and investigation. After the movement was launched, all localities sent a large number of cadres to lead the preparation for the establishment of people's communes, so the movement progressed rapidly, developed healthily, and the masses were satisfied. In debating issues such as "the establishment of people's communes is the inevitable trend of the development of the situation," "the benefits of people's communes," "who to rely on to run people's communes," and "the nature of people's communes," the peasants solved many confused ideas and became more motivated in their labor. After thoroughly airing their views and clarifying the issues, many peasants were in high spirits, believing they had taken the best lesson, and the commune's founding congress was the happiest day. Leading departments and commune cadres at all levels also had a clear understanding of the work after the establishment of the communes and proceeded in an orderly manner.

In the booming upsurge of establishing people's communes in rural Shanxi Province, news came that American imperialism was carrying out military provocations against our country, and the peasants immediately combined this with discussions on the current struggle situation and task requirements. From the first day of their establishment, the communes in various places fully utilized the favorable conditions of the communes to launch a struggle to support the liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands with practical actions; the province's rural production was also pushed to a higher upsurge. The communes throughout the province universally organized and expanded three great armies: one is the iron and steel army, going up the mountains to mine ore, dress ore, and build indigenous blast furnaces; one is the agricultural army, vigorously engaged in the late-stage processing of autumn fields, deep plowing, and manure accumulation; and one is the militia armed forces, stepping up rectification training and standing ready to respond to the call of the motherland. Liu Jiata and other four communes in Hequ County put forward the slogan of producing one more jin of iron to add one more point of strength to the liberation of Taiwan, and made unified arrangements for the iron factories of the original agricultural cooperatives in terms of labor, technical strength, and organizational leadership, and the daily output of iron quickly increased three times compared with the past.

### 山西公社化后建立三支大军

    山西公社化后建立三支大军
    钢铁大军—上山采矿选矿和兴建土高炉
    农业大军—大搞秋田后期加工翻地积肥
    民兵大军—加紧整训随时响应祖国召唤
    新华社太原13日电　山西省农村已经实现人民公社化。全省两万多个农业社，从8月上旬到9月上旬已先后合并转成八百九十个人民公社。山区公社一般是两千户左右，半山半川区多数在四千户上下，平川大部分是一万户左右。目前大部分公社正在整顿组织，订立新的规章制度。有些公社已经举行了社员大会，选出公社干部，并根据公社的特点部署了最近一个时期的工作。
    在这次规模壮阔的并大社转公社运动中，山西省各级党组织发动和组织群众大鸣大放大辩论，站在运动前面热情支持群众的迫切要求。中共山西省委曾先后三次布置各地发展人民公社的工作，并组织干部进行试点、规划和调查。各地在运动开展以后都派出大批干部，领导筹建人民公社，因此运动进展很快，发展健康，群众满意。农民们在辩论了“人民公社是形势发展的必然趋势”、“人民公社的好处”、“依靠谁办人民公社”，以及“人民公社的性质”等问题中，解决了许多糊涂思想，劳动劲头更大了。许多农民经过鸣透辩清，精神焕发，认为上了最好的一课，公社成立大会是最快乐的一天。各地领导部门和公社干部对建立起公社后的工作也作到了心中有数，有条不紊。
    在山西省农村轰轰烈烈建立人民公社的热潮中，传来了美帝国主义向我国进行军事挑衅的消息，各地农民立即结合讨论了当前斗争形势和任务要求。各地公社从成立第一天起，就充分利用公社的有利条件，展开了以实际行动支援解放台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争；全省农村的生产也由高潮推向更高潮。全省公社普遍组织和扩大了三支大军：一支是钢铁大军，上山采矿、选矿和兴建土高炉，一支是农业大军，大搞秋田后期加工、深翻地、积肥；一支是民兵武装大军，加紧整顿训练，随时响应祖国召唤。河曲县刘家塔等四个公社提出多出一斤铁，为解放台湾多增一分力的口号，把原来农业社的铁厂从劳力、技术力量、组织领导上作了统一安排，铁的日产量很快比过去增加三倍。
