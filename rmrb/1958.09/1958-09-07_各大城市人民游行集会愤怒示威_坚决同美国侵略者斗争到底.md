    Shanghai
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 6th: "Resolutely oppose American military provocations! We will not give up until Jinmen and Mazu are liberated, and Taiwan is liberated!" This is the roar issued by the seven million people of Shanghai on the banks of the Huangpu River tonight!
    Tonight, workers, farmers, students, office workers, and citizens of Shanghai, after hearing Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait on the radio, gathered one after another, and tens of thousands of people poured into the streets to march and demonstrate, resolutely supporting Premier Zhou's statement and angrily protesting American military provocations.
    Steelworkers said: "Smelt one more ton of steel to increase the strength for liberating Taiwan." Steelworkers in the open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 3 held a meeting in front of the furnace to protest against the United States' expansion of aggression against our territory. Steelworker Wang Jinming said that Premier Zhou's statement represents our determination and will. The open-hearth furnace workshop must produce one thousand tons more steel in September than in August to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.
    Zhong Min, chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, said at a meeting of veteran workers and advanced workers in the city that if the American imperialists continue to expand their aggression, we will take up guns to eliminate them. After ten o'clock, everyone was filled with uncontrollable anger, and immediately went to the Bund to march and demonstrate. Along the way, workers, government cadres, and citizens continued to pour into the marching ranks.
    Responsible persons of Shanghai Jiaotong University, Fudan University and other universities, local organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai, and non-party democrats also gathered tonight to strongly protest against the war provocations of American imperialism against our country.

This is a serious provocation to the 600 million people of our country and the people of the world. If the United States dares to provoke a war, the result will inevitably be to promote its own destruction!

    Tianjin
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 6th: The people of Tianjin have launched a magnificent demonstration to resolutely support Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region and protest the shameless provocations of American imperialism.
    At eight o'clock, an endless stream of people angrily took to the streets. More than 400,000 workers, students, government cadres, and shop assistants marched forward, holding high red flags and torches, shouting slogans such as "Oppose American imperialist military provocations and war threats," "Oppose American imperialist threats to peace in the Far East and the world," "We must liberate Jinmen and Mazu," and "We must liberate Taiwan."
    The workers of Tianjin Steel Plant who had just finished their shifts did not go home, but immediately organized a march and took to the streets. The heroes who are working hard and racing against time to produce steel decided to overfulfill the leap forward plan of 180,000 tons of steel.
    Teachers and students from six universities in Tianjin gathered and marched one after another. At the protest meeting held by more than 18,000 teachers and students from Tianjin University and Nankai University to oppose American imperialist provocations against our country, they unanimously adopted a protest letter supporting Premier Zhou's statement and protesting against the United States' interference in our liberation of Taiwan. Subsequently, teachers and students from the two universities held a demonstration.
    Taiwanese compatriots who have returned to Tianjin since 1953 to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland also held a meeting tonight. They excitedly stated that in order to liberate Taiwan as soon as possible, they are determined to stand on the front line of liberating Taiwan and contribute everything they have.

    Shenyang
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 6th: All circles in Shenyang gathered tonight to resolutely support Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region and strongly condemn the military provocations of American imperialism.

After listening to the broadcast of Premier Zhou's statement, one thousand teachers and students from Shenyang Medical College immediately shouted slogans and took to the streets to demonstrate.
    People from all walks of life in the city cannot suppress their resentment towards the U.S. imperialists' armed interference in China's internal affairs. They are rushing to make slogans overnight to prepare for tomorrow's gatherings and marches.
    Wang Fengen, a famous labor model in Shenyang and a worker at Shenyang Transformer Factory and professor of the Electrical Engineering Department of Northeast Institute of Technology, said that if American imperialism launches a war madly, we must give it a head-on blow like in the Korean War and eliminate them.

    Lin Donghai, director of the preparatory committee of the Guangzhou branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said: Our determination to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands cannot be shaken by the threats of American imperialism. If American imperialism disregards our serious warnings and dares to interfere in our country's liberation of Taiwan, it will inevitably be buried in the turbulent waves of the Taiwan Strait under the heavy blow of the Chinese people.
    In Guangzhou No. 1 Heavy Machinery Factory, after the broadcast of Premier Zhou's statement, the workers immediately gathered together from the workshop and held a meeting with more than 300 people.

    The people of the city, who were enjoying the weekend, went to the streets in groups from workshops, shops, offices, schools, and homes to march in the rain tonight. The workers who had just finished their shifts did not even have time to wash off the oil stains on their hands before participating in the march. Some housewives in the marching ranks held their children in one hand and raised the flags they had made in the other. As of press time, there were still angry slogans against American aggressors echoing everywhere on the streets.

If the American aggressors dare to violate the just rights of the 600 million Chinese people, the workers of Wuhan will go from the production front to the struggle to liberate Taiwan at any time. At present, we have made all preparations to ensure that as soon as the No. 1 blast furnace is put into production, it can produce iron normally and use more steel to support the liberation of Taiwan.
