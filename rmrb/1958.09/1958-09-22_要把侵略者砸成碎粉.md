　　We must go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. We must also exercise sovereignty over Chinese territory. Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the coastal islands occupied by the scum of the Chinese people, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, are Chinese territory, and we must exercise our sovereignty over these territories.

　　The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang occupies Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands, destroying the integrity of Chinese territory, and preventing the Chinese people from completely unifying China. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang also uses these places to harass our socialist construction. We are fully free to punish these scum by any means we wish to use. This is the sovereignty of the Chinese people, it is the Chinese people's own business, it is supported by all just and peace-loving people in the world, and no one has the right to interfere.

　　However, the American imperialist aggressors have stubbornly sent armed forces to occupy our Taiwan, and sent warships and aircraft to invade our territorial waters and airspace, carrying out military provocations and war threats against us, creating tension in the Taiwan Strait. This is a well-known act of aggression. But American imperialism says that we are the "aggressors" and demands that we "cease fire." Cease fire with whom? We are not at war with the United States, so where is there a fire to cease? We are carrying out military punishment against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. What qualifications do American imperialists have to interfere? Are we "aggressors"? Whom are we aggressing against on our own territory? Are we aggressing against ourselves? Isn't this the biggest joke in the world?

　　American aggressors, you better be "sensible" and get out of the Taiwan Strait quickly! The current era is the era when the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. The Chinese people, who have stood up, will never allow imperialists to run rampant on Chinese territory again. Six hundred million Chinese people have raised their iron hammers high. If the aggressors don't get out, they will be smashed to dust.

    要把侵略者砸成碎粉
    张修竹
    我们要鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义。我们也要在中国的领土上行使主权。中国人民的败类、蒋匪帮所霸占的台湾、澎湖列岛和沿海岛屿，是中国的领土，我们要在这些领土上行使我们的主权。
    蒋匪帮占据着台湾、澎湖和沿海岛屿，破坏了中国领土的完整，使中国人民还没有能够把中国完全统一起来。蒋匪帮还利用这些地方来骚扰我们的社会主义建设。我们完全有自由按照自己愿意使用的任何方法，来惩办这些败类。这是中国人民的主权，是中国人民自己的事情，是世界上一切正义的、爱好和平的人们所支持的事情，是任何人也无权干涉的事情。
    可是美帝国主义侵略者，硬派武装力量霸占我国的台湾，并派军舰和飞机侵犯我国的领海和领空，向我们进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，制造台湾海峡的紧张局势。这是尽人皆知的侵略行动。可是美国帝国主义反而说我们是“侵略者”，要我们“停火”。我们和谁停火？和美国没有打仗，哪里有火可停，我们对蒋匪帮实行军事惩罚，美帝国主义者有什么资格来干涉？我们是“侵略者”吗？我们在自己的领土上侵略谁呢？是自己侵略自己吗？这岂不是天大的笑话？
    美国侵略者还是“识相”一点，赶快从台湾海峡滚出去！现在的时代是东风压倒西风的时代。站了起来的中国人民，再也不会允许帝国主义者在中国的领土上横行霸道。六亿中国人民高高举起了铁锤，如果侵略者不滚开就要被砸成碎粉。
