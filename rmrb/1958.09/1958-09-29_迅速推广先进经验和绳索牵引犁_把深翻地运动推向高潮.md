Xinhua News Agency Report: Rapidly promote advanced experiences in large-scale deep plowing and rope-traction plows, and universally push the deep plowing movement to a climax. This was the main requirement put forward to various regions by the Ministry of Agriculture at the National Deep Plowing Land Telephone Conference held on the evening of the 26th. At this conference, five regions introduced their experiences and methods in carrying out the deep plowing movement.

In order to plant all winter wheat on deeply plowed land, the provinces and cities in the main winter wheat producing areas of the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins have successively launched deep plowing movements since early September. By mid-September, most areas had formed a high tide of deep plowing. According to recent statistics, ten provinces and cities including Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Beijing, Shaanxi, Gansu, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Hubei have deeply plowed more than 129 million mu of land, accounting for more than 30% of the winter wheat planting area. Among them, the scale and momentum of the deep plowing movement in the four provinces and cities of Henan, Shandong, Hebei, and Beijing are particularly massive, with more than 32 million deep plowing troops fighting day and night in the fields, and the daily plowing progress is very rapid. However, according to the Ministry of Agriculture's understanding, the progress of deep plowing varies greatly from place to place. Some places have already accounted for 70%-80% of the wheat field area, while others are less than a quarter, and individual counties have only plowed 10%-15%. A small portion of the wheat fields were plowed to a depth of less than one foot; some places lacked experience and turned up raw soil, which did not meet quality requirements. In addition, in general areas, 20%-30% of the deeply plowed land has not yet been fertilized with base fertilizer, and in individual places, the proportion of unfertilized land has reached more than half.

In order to reverse this situation and universally push the deep plowing movement to a climax, the Ministry of Agriculture invited Henan and Hebei provinces, which have carried out the deep plowing movement relatively well, as well as Shangqiu Special District in Henan Province and Chang'an County in Shaanxi Province, to introduce their experiences at the telephone conference; Jiangsu Province was invited to introduce its experience in promoting rope-traction plows, in order to further promote the rapid popularization of this deep耕工具 in various places.

Among the experiences introduced by various regions, the most important is to strengthen leadership, comprehensively plan, rationally arrange labor, and ensure that steelmaking and iron smelting and the three autumn tasks, with deep plowing as the main focus, are not neglected. Henan and Hebei provinces have organized rural labor and animal power into two major armies based on the needs of steelmaking and iron smelting and autumn agricultural production, divided into two fronts, each with dedicated personnel in charge, and commanded the operations separately. In the agricultural production army, various professional teams were organized separately.

Secondly, the secretaries took the lead, personally grasped deep plowing, and responsible cadres were assigned to specific areas, taking the lead and leading the plowing. Wherever this was done, the plowing movement was in full swing. In Shangqiu Special District, Henan Province, more than 390 secretaries of the Prefectural Committee, County Committee, and People's Commune Party Committee led more than 27,000 cadres to take the lead in deep plowing and personally commanded on the front lines, which greatly encouraged the masses. More than 2.4 million farmers rushed to plow the land day and night, and more than 7.56 million mu of land have been plowed in more than 20 days, and more than 85% have been fertilized with base fertilizer.

Thirdly, various regions have carried out large-scale corps operations, implemented military organization, combat-like actions, collective living, and universal construction of sheds, promoted eating, living, and other "ten to the fields" and "fifteen to the fields," and enthusiastically launched red flag competitions, which greatly improved labor efficiency and plowing progress.

At the telephone conference, Liu Ruilong, Vice Minister of Agriculture, said in his final speech that all regions felt that labor was tight. To solve this problem, it is necessary to vigorously grasp tool reform, especially to promote rope-traction plows as soon as possible. Before October 20, every commune and team should have them.

    迅速推广先进经验和绳索牵引犁
    把深翻地运动推向高潮
    据新华社讯  迅速推广大搞深翻的先进经验和绳索牵引犁，把深翻土地运动普遍推向高潮。这是农业部在26日晚召开的全国深翻土地电话会议上对各地提出的主要要求。这次会议有五个地方介绍了开展深翻运动的经验和办法。
    为把冬小麦全部种在深翻土地上，冬小麦主要产区黄河和长江流域各省、市从9月上旬以来相继掀起了深翻运动。到9月中旬大部分地区都已形成深翻高潮。据最近统计，河南、河北、山东、山西、北京、陕西、甘肃、安徽、江苏、湖北等十个省市已经深翻土地一亿二千九百多万亩，占冬种麦田面积的30％以上。其中河南、山东、河北、北京等四个省市深翻运动的规模和声势尤为浩大，三千二百多万深翻大军正日夜在田间奋战，每日翻耕的进度很快。但据农业部了解，各地深翻进度很不平衡，快的已占麦田面积70％—80％，慢的还不到四分之一，个别县份只翻了10％—15％。一小部分麦地翻耕的深度还不到一尺；有些地方缺乏经验，把生土翻了上来，不合质量要求。另外，一般地区都有20％—30％的深翻地还没施上底肥，个别地方未施肥的达到一半以上。
    为了扭转这种情况，把深翻运动普遍推向高潮，在电话会议上农业部请深翻运动开展得较好的河南、河北两省和河南省商丘专区、陕西省长安县介绍了经验；邀请江苏省介绍了推广绳索牵引犁的经验，以便进一步推动各地迅速把这种深耕工具推广开来。
    各地介绍的经验中，首要的一条是加强领导，全面规划，合理安排劳力，保证炼铁炼钢和以深翻为主的三秋工作两不误。河南、河北两省都根据炼钢炼铁和秋季农业生产的需要，把农村劳力、畜力等组成两支大军，划分两条战线，各有专人负责，分头指挥作战。在农业生产这支大军中，分别组织了各种专业队。
    其次，书记挂帅，亲抓深翻，负责干部分片包干，带头和领导翻地。凡是这样做的地方，翻地运动都搞得热火朝天。河南省商丘专区由于三百九十多名地委、县委和人民公社党委的书记带领二万七千多名干部带头参加深翻，并在阵地上亲自指挥，对群众鼓舞极大。二百四十多万农民星夜突击翻地，二十多天已翻地七百五十六万多亩，85％以上都施了底肥。
    再次，各地搞大兵团作战，实行组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化，遍地工棚化，推行吃、住等“十到田”、“十五到田”，热烈展开红旗竞赛等，也大大提高了劳动效率和翻地进度。
    电话会议上，农业部副部长刘瑞龙最后在发言中说，各地都感到劳力紧张，要解决这个问题，就要大抓工具改革，特别要尽快的推广绳索牵引犁，在10月20日以前，要做到社社队队都有。
