Let Winter Wheat All Be Planted on Deep-Plowed Land
Rapid Progress in Deep Plowing in the Yellow River Basin; Good Deep Plowing Methods at the Qutou Branch

This newspaper reports that the deep plowing land movement in the winter wheat producing areas of the Yellow River Basin is entering a climax. After more than ten days of hard work, the area of wheat fields deep-plowed in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, and the suburbs of Beijing has increased from more than 20 million mu at the end of August to more than 50 million mu. The depth of plowing is generally around one and a half chi [1 chi = 1/3 meter], and large areas of high-yield fields and "satellite" fields are deep-plowed to more than two chi up to five chi. Among them, Henan Province, where the deep plowing movement has already formed a climax, is far ahead, having plowed more than 19 million mu by the 14th.

The instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on deep plowing and soil improvement are a huge driving force for pushing the deep plowing movement in the Yellow River Basin to a climax. The autumn planting work in this area is about to begin on a large scale. In order to plant all winter wheat on deeply plowed land, the leading organs of various provinces and cities have taken various measures to quickly implement the spirit of the central instructions.

The peasants, cadres, and students who have invested in the deep plowing movement have all implemented militarized organization, combat-oriented action, and collectivized life. Millions of peasants have formed deep plowing field corps with people's communes as units, with the commune party secretary or director serving as commander, directing battalions, companies, and platoons in "operations" according to plan. In many areas, the deep plowing army is carrying out day and night raids under the slogan of "conducting large-scale corps operations, eating and living without leaving the front line." This method of large-scale corps operations has shown great power in deep plowing. First of all, the progress of plowing is rapid and the quality can be guaranteed. The 1.5 million-strong deep plowing army in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, has not only ensured that early autumn land is plowed as soon as it is harvested due to eating and living in the fields and rushing to plow day and night, but many townships and communes have also achieved "small plots of land not past noon, large plots of land not past night," and have all met the quality requirements for deep plowing. The more than 1.35 million mu of wheat land that has been plowed is generally more than one and a half chi deep, and more than 100,000 jin of base fertilizer has been applied to each mu in layers. Secondly, flexible deployment has created very favorable conditions for communist-style large-scale collaboration. In many places in Hebei and Henan provinces, the deep plowing armies have opened up township boundaries, commune boundaries, and even county boundaries, and gone wherever early autumn is harvested first to support each other and rush to plow and cultivate. The mountainous area of Changping District in the suburbs of Beijing has a field corps of 20,000 people who bring their own food and tools to the plains to help the people's communes in the plains area to deep plow.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 19th. The Qutou Branch of the Yongledian People's Commune in Tongzhou District, Beijing, has greatly accelerated the progress of deep plowing by concentrating manpower, using "large corps" operations, and adopting the working method of dividing responsibility by sections and assembly line operations. The average person plows seven fen [1 fen = 1/10 acre] of land per day, and the depth is more than one and a half chi. From late August to September 16, more than 83% of the 18,000 mu of wheat land in the entire branch has been deep-plowed.

The method of plowing in this commune is: before plowing, the land to be deep-plowed is divided into long strips of equal distance, each strip being three to five iron spades wide. In each section, two people work, one person in front uses an iron spade to turn up the topsoil and throw it onto the surface of a strip of land to the right. The second person immediately loosens the soil in place where the topsoil has been turned, deepening the plowing layer and not throwing the subsoil below elsewhere. In this way, after the second person in the first section finishes loosening the soil in place, the second section can begin to work, using the same method as the first section. The third section follows the second section, and the fourth section follows the third section. In this way, one section follows another, and the topsoil is always pressed on the turned subsoil. The work is carried out continuously, the land is very flat, the efficiency is very high, and they supervise each other to avoid idleness.

When adopting this deep plowing method, in terms of manpower allocation, the principle of "soldier to soldier, general to general" is followed, and people with similar labor power are separated into teams, so that the work is closely connected.

### 让冬麦都种在深翻地上  黄河流域翻地进度快　渠头分社翻地方法好

    让冬麦都种在深翻地上
    黄河流域翻地进度快　渠头分社翻地方法好
    本报讯　黄河流域冬小麦产区的深翻土地运动正在步入高潮。经过最近十多天的奋战，晋、冀、鲁、豫、陕和北京市郊区深翻的麦地已由8月底的二千万多亩增至五千多万亩，耕深一般都在一尺五寸左右，大面积丰产田和“卫星”田都深翻二尺以上到五尺。其中，深翻运动已经形成高潮的河南省遥遥领先，到14日已翻一千九百多万亩。
    中共中央关于深耕和改良土壤的指示是把黄河流域深翻运动推向高潮的一个巨大动力。这个地区的秋种工作即将大规模展开，为把冬小麦全部种在经过深翻的土地上，各省、市领导机关都采取各种措施迅速地贯彻了中央指示精神。
    各地投入深翻运动的农民和干部、学生等，都实行了组织军事化、行动战斗化和生活集体化。千百万农民以人民公社为单位组成了深翻地的野战兵团，由公社党委书记或社长等任司令员，按计划指挥营、连、排“作战”。很多地区的深翻地大军，在“大搞兵团作战，吃住不下火线”的口号下，日夜进行突击。这种大兵团作战的方法，在深翻中显示了很大威力。首先，翻地进度迅速，能够保证质量。河北省邯郸专区一百五十万翻地大军，由于吃住到田，日夜抢翻，不仅保证了早秋地随收随翻，很多乡社做到了“小块地不过午，大块地不过夜”，还都达到了深翻的质量要求。已经翻完的一百三十五万多亩麦地一般都深达一尺五寸以上，每亩分层施了底肥十万多斤。其次，调动灵活，为共产主义大协作准备了非常有利的条件。河北、河南两省许多地方的翻地大军，打开乡界、社界甚至县界，哪里先收完早秋就开赴哪里，互相支援，抢翻抢耕。北京市郊昌平区的山区，有两万人参加的野战兵团，自带伙食和工具，开到平原，帮助平原地区的人民公社深翻。
    本报讯　北京市通州区永乐店人民公社渠头分社，由于集中人力，“大兵团”作战，并采取分段负责，流水作业的工作方法，使深翻地的进度大大加快，平均每人每天翻地七分，深度都在一尺五寸以上。这个社从8月下旬到9月16日，全分社一万八千亩麦地已深翻83％以上。
    这个社翻地的方法是：在翻地以前，将准备深翻的地块，划成距离相等的长条，每条地宽三铁铣到五铁铣为一段。每个地段里，有两个人干活，前边一人用铁铣将表面上的熟土翻起，掷到右边一条地的表面上，第二个人，紧接着在翻过表面熟土的地方，用铣在原地松土，加深耕层，不再将下边的生土掷到别处。这样做，第一段第二个人干完原地松土的活茬以后，第二段就可以开始干活，作法与第一段相同。第三段接着第二段，第四段接着第三段。这样，一段接着一段，熟土老是压在翻过的生土上，工作连续进行，地很平整，效率很高，互相督促，不会窝工。
    采用这种深翻方法时，在人力搭配上，本着“兵对兵、将对将”的原则，将劳动力差不多的人分开编队，使工作紧紧衔接进行。
