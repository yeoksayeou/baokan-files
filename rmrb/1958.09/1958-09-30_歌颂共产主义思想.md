In the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory, there is a worker named Ma Xueli who, in the technical revolution, created several important machine tools of great value. However, he just buried himself in his work, not saying a word, and gave the tools he created to others to use. So even though he created the tools, no one knew he did it. When people found out and asked Ma Xueli why he didn't say anything, he replied, "As long as the work is done well and everyone is satisfied, that is my greatest happiness."

What a great voice! What a noble style!

Since the Great Leap Forward, the people of our country have been in high spirits, not only daring to think, speak, and act, but also being selfless. They have invented and created countless invaluable things, and various satellites are flying all over the sky. But for all of this, no one has ever heard of any inventor reaching out to the state or the people for even half a cent! They are heroes who have transcended petty interests!

The heroic deeds created by Comrade Ma Xueli or comrades like Comrade Ma Xueli often leave my heart unsettled for a long time. Because it was not long ago that our people were still ruled in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. In that society, the bourgeoisie turned everything in society into commodities, even including their wives, children, and lives. As long as they had money, they would stop at nothing! Their life philosophy was "Heaven and earth will punish those who do not act for themselves!" Everything revolved around themselves. In a commonly used phrase, it was extreme individualism. They lived for personal fame and gain, for personal clothing and food! For personal gain, they did not hesitate to use all kinds of despicable means, ruining others' families to enrich themselves. They boasted everywhere about their deception of others. Those of us who are older, just by closing our eyes and thinking, can vividly recall the tragic scene of "man eating man" in capitalist society. After liberation, the old social system was overthrown, and a socialist society was established. People's socialist thought soared to unprecedented heights. All of this, compared to the old society, is as different as heaven and earth.

However, is everyone like this? Of course not. There are still many things that make people feel that although the capitalist system has been overthrown, bourgeois ideology still often confuses some people, and ideological transformation is not so smooth sailing. For example, some professors clearly do not understand a certain science, but for personal fame and gain, they stubbornly pretend to understand, even resorting to plagiarism and theft to create a facade, cheat for treatment, and cheat for royalties. Some people only know how to boast about themselves; some technicians bargain with the leadership in advance before inventing something; and some people are keenly interested in fighting for ranks and treatment, while others directly express: "I am worth more than this"… They, like the bourgeoisie, regard themselves as something similar to commodities. They believe that money is the driving force of work.

These people's thoughts and actions, from the perspective of bourgeois rights, seem to be self-evident and beyond reproach. But compared with the actions of people of our era – such as Comrade Ma Xueli and others – how obvious is the lowliness of their style and the vulgarity of their flavor, and how foolish, ridiculous, and absurd they seem.

From here, people can see that there are two kinds of people in the world: one kind of person lives to eat, which, to put it mildly, is low and vulgar; the other kind of person eats only to live, and the purpose of living is for the happiness of the human collective – a communist society. These two kinds of thoughts are always mortal enemies. Facts have proven that only communist thought has great vitality. The revolutionary struggle carried out by the people of our country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the ultimate goal of establishing a communist society, from the very beginning used its own actions to launch a fierce struggle against this ugly thought of the bourgeoisie, and gradually declared the bankruptcy of bourgeois individualism and bourgeois rights. Everyone remembers that the revolutionary队伍(duìwǔ: ranks, troops) led by our Party, in the Jinggang Mountains, in the 25,000-li Long March, when fighting the Japanese devils and Chiang Kai-shek, lived on a supply system, even going several days without a single meal. The imperialists and the bourgeoisie once said: "Who would go to do communist work that is so hard? Don't fight, they will starve to death." But not only did we not collapse, but we became stronger and bigger in that kind of life. In this kind of life, everyone was equal and helped each other, life was happy, and everyone was full of energy. Not to mention that no one fought for ranks or made trouble over treatment, even bloodshed and sacrifice were disregarded. Finally, we finally achieved victory. Now, in the Great Leap Forward, people work hard day and night, and their spirits are so happy and their moods are so cheerful. Can capitalists buy this soaring revolutionary drive of the people with a few stinky copper coins? No, absolutely not!

So, what is it that makes people so courageous and invincible? It is communist thought!

Ma Xueli and the thousands upon thousands of working people in our country are thoroughly destroying all the ugly thoughts of the bourgeoisie with the force of thunder, and are going all out to build a socialist society – a communist society – with the spirit of communism. Each of us, especially every intellectual, should draw lessons from this.

Let us shout: Long live communist thought! Let us hold high the red flag of communist thought and advance!

    歌颂共产主义思想
    海波
    武汉重型机床厂有个工人马学礼，在技术革命中，创造了好几种重要机具，价值很大，但他每天只是闷着头干，不吭声儿，创造出工具就给别人去使。所以虽然他把工具创造出来了，可是谁也不知道是他干的。当人们发觉以后，问马学礼为什么不吭声，他回答说：“只要把工作作好，大家满意，这就是我最大的幸福了。”
    这是多么伟大的声音！这是多么高尚的风格！
    自从大跃进以来，我国人民意气风发，不仅敢想敢说敢干，而且大公无私。他们发明创造了千千万万价值万金的东西，各种卫星满天飞，但所有这些，从来没有听说那个发明者伸手向国家向人民要过半文钱！他们是脱离了低级趣味的英雄们！
    马学礼同志或和马学礼同志一样的同志们所创造的一些英雄事迹，往往使我心里久久不能平静。因为曾几何时，我们的人民还被统治在半封建半殖民地的社会里，在那种社会里，资产阶级把社会上的一切都变成了商品，甚至包括自己的妻子儿女和生命，只要有了钱，他们就不顾一切！他们的人生哲学是“人不为己，天诛地灭”！一切都以自己为中心。用一句常用的话来说，就是极端个人主义。他们活着就是为了个人名利，就是为了个人穿衣吃饭！为了个人，他们不惜利用一切卑鄙手段，倾别人之家，致自己之富。到处吹嘘自己欺诈别人。我们年纪较大一点的人，只要闭眼一想，资本主义社会那种“人吃人”的惨象就会历历在目。解放后，旧的社会制度被推翻了，社会主义社会建立起来了，人们的社会主义思想空前高涨。这一切和旧社会比较起来，真如天渊之别。
    但是，是不是一切人都是这样了呢？当然不是，还有许多事情仍然使人感到资本主义制度虽然被打倒，但资产阶级思想还常常使某些人神志不清，思想改造并不那样一帆风顺。譬如说，有的教授明明不懂某门科学，但为了个人名利，硬是不懂装懂，甚至不惜以抄袭偷窃来装门面，骗取待遇，骗取稿费，有的人则专会吹嘘自己；有的技术人员，在发明一件东西以前就事先向领导上讨价还价；还有些人对争级别争待遇兴趣盎然，有的则直接表示：“我不至值这几个”……他们和资产阶级一样，把自己看作和商品差不多的东西。他们认为钱是工作的动力。
    这些人的思想和言行，用资产阶级法权观点看来，似乎是天经地义无可非议的，但用我们时代的人——和马学礼同志等人的所作所为比较起来，风格之低下，气味之庸俗是多么明显，而且显得多么愚蠢，可笑和荒唐。
    从这里，人们可以看出，世界上有两种人，一种人活着就是为了吃饭，客气一点说，是低级庸俗；另一种人吃饭仅是为了活着，活着的目的则是为了人类集体的幸福——共产主义社会。这两种思想始终是死对头。事实证明，只有共产主义思想才是有伟大的生命力。我国人民在中国共产党的领导下所进行的以建立共产主义社会为最终目的的革命斗争，一开始就用自己的行动向资产阶级的这种丑恶思想展开了激烈斗争。并逐步宣告了资产阶级个人主义和资产阶级法权思想的破产。大家记得，我们党领导的革命队伍，在井冈山上、在二万五千里长征中，在打鬼子、打蒋介石的时候，大家过着供给制生活，甚至几天吃不到一顿饭，帝国主义和资产阶级曾经说：“共产党队伍那样苦有谁去干，不要打，饿也会饿垮的。”但我们不但没有垮，而且就在那样的生活中，越战越强、越打越大，在这种生活中，大家平等互助，生活愉快，干劲十足，不要说没有人争级别闹待遇，就是流血牺牲也在所不顾，最后我们终于取得了胜利。如今，在大跃进中，人们不分昼夜苦干，精神是那样愉快，心情是那样舒畅。资本家拿着几个臭铜钱能买到人民这股冲天的革命干劲吗？不，绝对不能！
    那么，是什么东西使人这样勇猛向前所向无敌？是共产主义思想！
    马学礼和我国千千万万的劳动人民都正在以雷霆万钧之势彻底破除资产阶级的一切丑恶思想，以共产主义精神全力以赴地建立社会主义社会——共产主义社会，我们每一个人，特别是每一个知识分子都应该从这里得到教益。
    让我们高呼：共产主义思想万岁！让我们高举着共产主义的思想红旗前进！
