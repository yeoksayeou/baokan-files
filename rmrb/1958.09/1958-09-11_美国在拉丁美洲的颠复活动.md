    US Subversion in Latin America
    Xiao Guang
    The United States twice instigated military coups in Venezuela on July 22nd and September 7th this year, plotting to subvert the country's legitimate government and attempting to restore the overthrown pro-American dictatorial regime. In July of this year, the United States also instigated a military coup in Haiti; and the US Marines openly announced their readiness to carry out armed intervention in Cuba under the pretext of "protecting water sources." These subversive plots and armed intervention activities carried out by the United States against Latin American countries have met with shameful failure due to the protests and opposition of the Latin American people and the people of the world, but this has once again exposed the hideous face of the American colonialists.

    For a long time, the United States has treated Latin American countries with the domineering attitude of a colonial country. The United States forces Latin American countries to make all aspects of their policies conform to its colonial interests; otherwise, it either creates rebellions and coups, subverts the legitimate governments of these countries, or openly carries out armed intervention.

    Since 1823, when US President Monroe issued his "Monroe Doctrine," the United States has used the slogan "America for the Americans" to proclaim itself the protector of North and South America and vigorously expand in the Western Hemisphere. After decades of implementation of the "Monroe Doctrine," the Americas have changed from "America for the Americans" to "America for the United States."

    In the first three decades of the twentieth century, in order to plunder huge profits, American monopoly groups unscrupulously dispatched naval forces to Central and South America, especially the Caribbean region, to carry out blatant armed intervention. According to incomplete statistics, the United States organized more than 100 armed interventions and coups in Latin America in the fifty years from 1898 alone.

    Let's see how US Marine Corps General Smedley Butler described their mission in Latin America:
    "In 1914, I helped clean up Mexico, especially Tampico, to benefit the American oil industry. I helped turn Haiti and Cuba into places suitable for Citibank to collect taxes...
    I helped Brown Brothers International Bank clarify the situation in Nicaragua in 1902-1912. In 1916, I clarified the situation in the Dominican Republic for the American sugar industry. In 1903, I helped turn Honduras into a place beneficial to the American fruit company..."

    The piratical acts and "big stick" policy of the United States have left extremely painful memories for the people of Latin America.
    Mexicans have not forgotten that the United States seized a large area of land from them in 1846-1848.
    Brazilians remember how US Admiral Benham commanded the US fleet to fire on the insurgents and frantically suppress the revolution during the civil war in 1893-1894.
    In Colombia, no one does not know that Panama was separated from Colombia precisely because of the "revolution" created by the United States in 1903-1904, and the benefit the United States received was: the ten-mile-wide strip of land of the Panama Canal.
    Dominicans have not forgotten the bombardment of the coast of the Republic by the US fleet in 1904. The people of Haiti and Nicaragua will never forget that American soldiers were stationed in their territory for twenty years! ...

    After the 1930s, the economic crisis that occurred in the capitalist world greatly weakened the position of the United States in the world; the political and economic relations between the United States and Latin America became increasingly strained due to its hegemonic policy. In order to more effectively deal with the growing nationalism and democratic movements of the people of Latin American countries and defeat increased imperialist competition, the then US President Roosevelt decided to repackage the old imperialist policy and put forward the "Good Neighbor" policy. But in fact, even during the entire "Good Neighbor" policy period, the United States did not give up interfering in the internal affairs of Latin American countries and making threats of force. During this period, the United States colluded with Batista to overthrow the San Martin government in Cuba; instigated and participated in the Gran Chaco (Great Canyon) war between Paraguay and Bolivia for oil-rich resources; supported reactionaries and interfered in Brazil's internal affairs in the 1935-1937 Vargas coup in Brazil; and in 1938, undermined the nationalization program of the Cardenas government by ceasing to purchase Mexican silver and oil....

    World War II had a particularly profound impact on Latin America. In the late stages of the war and in the initial post-war years, the people's movements in Latin America were inspired by the victory of the anti-fascist struggle, and were quite active in the political life of many countries. In some countries, democratic forces and political forces with progressive tendencies even replaced dictatorial regimes. For example: Guatemala launched an armed uprising in 1944 that overthrew the Ubico dictatorship; in 1946, the Chilean People's Front won in the elections; the democratic forces in Venezuela won in the 1947 elections and established a regime headed by the famous democratic writer Gallegos; in addition, progressive forces in countries such as Brazil, Cuba, and Uruguay also achieved significant success in the elections.

    This situation was naturally intolerable to American imperialism, which had become the new center of reaction and aggression in the world after the war. Therefore, in order to maintain and strengthen its control and plunder of Latin America, the United States did not hesitate to tear off the cloak of "good neighbor" and openly appear as the world's gendarme, using all kinds of despicable means to strangle the democracy, freedom and national independence of Latin American countries.

    This is the reason why coups have occurred one after another in Latin American countries after the war. According to statistics, from 1948 to 1958, the United States carried out as many as fourteen major subversive events in Latin America:

    1. In October 1948, the United States instigated a military coup in Peru, bringing the dictator Odria to power. (But this tyrant was finally overthrown by the people in June 1956.)
    2. In November 1948, the United States instigated a coup in Venezuela, bringing the dictator Jimenez to power. (But he was finally overthrown by the people in January 1958.)
    3. In December 1948, the United States instigated a coup in El Salvador, bringing the dictator Osorio to power. (But he was finally overthrown by the people in March 1956.)
    4. In May 1951, the United States instigated a fascist coup in Bolivia led by Ballivian. (But the people launched an armed uprising in April 1952 and finally overthrew this dictatorial tyrant.)
    5. In March 1952, the United States instigated a coup in Cuba, bringing the dictator Batista to power. (Currently, the Cuban people are engaged in a vigorous armed struggle against the Batista dictatorship.)
    6. In June 1954, the United States instigated Armas to lead troops from Honduras to invade Guatemala, and President Arbenz was forced to step down. (In July 1957, the dictatorial tyrant Armas was assassinated.)
    7. In August 1954, the United States instigated reactionary officers in Brazil to launch a coup, and the 71-year-old President Vargas was forced to commit suicide.
    8. In the second half of 1954, the United States plotted a coup conspiracy in Mexico, but it was crushed by the people.
    9. In January 1955, the United States drove the Nicaraguan dictatorial tyrant Somoza to launch an armed attack on Costa Rica, but it was repelled.
    10. In May 1955, the United States instigated a conspiracy in Chile aimed at dissolving the parliament and establishing a military dictatorship, but it was crushed by democratic forces.
    11. In October and November 1955, the United States plotted the Filo-Luz coup conspiracy in Brazil, but it was crushed by the people.
    12. In July 1958, the United States instigated Venezuelan Defense Minister Castro-Leon to hold a military coup, which was thoroughly crushed by the people.
    13. In July 1958, the United States instigated reactionary officers to hold a coup in Haiti, which suffered a disastrous defeat.
    14. In July 1958, the United States plotted and directed a military coup launched by a reactionary group headed by Rial, commander of the Buenos Aires Naval Military Region in Argentina, which was crushed by the people.

    From the above table, a characteristic can be seen, that is: any legitimate government supported by the people, the United States will do everything possible to sabotage it, and even get rid of it; and the puppet dictatorial regime opposed and despised by the people, the United States will impose it on the people no matter what.

    The methods adopted by the United States are nothing more than the following three:

    The first is to carry out political interference, control the development of political forces in other countries, and make it conform to the interests of US imperialism. One example is the former Videla regime in Chile.

    In 1946, Videla was elected with the support of the People's Front, backed by 300,000 Chilean workers. However, when Videla urgently needed Washington's $50 million loan, the United States used all kinds of shameless means to induce him to betray the People's Front. The new regime quickly deteriorated. The Communist Party was declared illegal, and 90,000 citizens were deprived of their right to vote; the US "loyalty oath" spy persecution system was implemented among Chilean civil servants; the workers' movement was brutally suppressed; and thousands of labor leaders and fighters were thrown into prisons and concentration camps.

    The second method of the United States is secret subversion; replacing regimes that are not obedient enough to it with US agents. In order to achieve this goal, from monetary bribery to launching propaganda offensives, psychological warfare, from arson, assassination to organizing coups, and even the "joint demonstration" of airplanes and fleets, almost everything is used. And all these activities are mostly carried out under the personal planning and command of the American ambassador; the puppets who replace the legitimate government are also "internally determined" by the personnel of the American embassy in their offices.

    In August 1954, the 71-year-old President Vargas of Brazil was sacrificed under this kind of American clutches. President Vargas, who had ruled Brazil for nearly 20 years, adopted some restrictive measures against American monopoly groups at the request of the broad masses of the people. For example, the establishment of the Brazilian Petroleum Corporation; the plan to confiscate foreign (American) power companies and develop the power generation industry with its own strength; the re-restriction of the remittance of interest and profits of foreign companies out of the country; the increase of the minimum wage, etc. These measures aroused the rage of the American monopoly capital group. On the one hand, the US ruling group used the issue of coffee prices to exert great economic pressure on the Vargas government, causing Brazil's coffee exports to the United States in 1954 to decrease by 3.31 million bags compared with 1953, resulting in a loss of 300 million US dollars in foreign exchange and creating a huge fiscal deficit. At the same time, they plotted a coup in Brazil, plotting to replace Vargas with the pro-American element and Vice President Café Filho. In August 1954, under the planning of the US ambassador, the Brazilian reactionary military officer group openly exerted armed pressure, and even dispatched tanks to surround the presidential palace and set up artillery in key points of the capital, fiercely forcing Vargas to "take a vacation." The 71-year-old Vargas finally committed suicide under the coercion of this heavy and brutal pressure.

    A further step taken by the United States to deal with Latin American democratic regimes is to instigate large-scale armed subversive activities and direct armed intervention. In this regard, the incident that occurred in Guatemala in 1954 is a prominent example.

    Guatemala is a small country in Central America with a population of just over 3 million and an area of less than 110,000 square kilometers. The American monopoly capital group's United Fruit Company, Central American International Railway Company, and American Guatemalan Power Company controlled almost all of the country's economic lifeline. The people of Guatemala were subjected to poverty, whipping, imprisonment and even killing under the enslavement and control of the American monopoly group. In 1944, the angry civilians and democratic forces in the army, inspired by the victory of the anti-fascist struggle, launched an armed uprising to overthrow the dictatorial regime. This revolution created a bourgeois democratic republic, enabling Guatemala to begin to move towards getting rid of imperialist enslavement. However, the American monopoly group hated the new Guatemalan regime because it could not be driven by it as before. During the term of office of Dr. Arevalo, the first president of Guatemala (1945-1951), the United States instigated more than 30 subversive conspiracies alone. The Arbenz government, which took office in 1951, promulgated a land reform decree in order to make the country obtain complete economic independence and facilitate the development of domestic capitalism. In addition, it also took some measures to restrict the American monopoly organization's rule over the Guatemalan economy. These reform measures touched the interests of the American monopoly group; and what made the United States even more worried was that Guatemala would set an example of anti-American struggle for Latin American countries. Therefore, the US ruling group immediately shouted loudly that Guatemala had "fallen into the 'control' of international communism" to create an excuse for its conspiracy to overthrow the Arbenz government.

    The US State Department first exerted diplomatic pressure on Guatemala, but failed to make the Arbenz government yield. Then, the United States bought off Colonel Armas, a traitor of the Guatemalan people, and provided him with a monthly funding of 150,000 US dollars to recruit traitors and foreign mercenaries in Nicaragua and Honduras, trained by American officers, preparing to use large-scale military action to carry out subversion. At the same time, the United States carried out preparations for intervention through the Pan American Organization.

    In June 1954, under the direction of the United States, the Armas bandit gang, an agent of the United States, led 5,000 people from Honduras in two ways to invade Guatemala, but they were met with strong resistance from the Guatemalan people. Seeing that its plan for armed subversion from the outside had encountered difficulties, the US imperialists planned for reactionary Guatemalan officers to organize a coup from within. American newspapers did not conceal that this military coup, like the armed intervention in Guatemala, was organized by the US State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency, headed by the Dulles brothers. When the conspiracy was ready, US Ambassador to Guatemala, Peurifoy, went to meet with the Guatemalan Foreign Minister and openly demanded the resignation of the Arbenz government in the form of an ultimatum and a "complete purge" of state organs; at the same time, reactionary soldiers launched a rebellion and coerced the Arbenz government. Thus, the Arbenz government, which was supported by the Guatemalan people, was openly strangled by the United States.

    Latin Americans have never forgotten the countless disasters and harms that American colonialists have historically brought to Latin American countries, and they increasingly do not allow it to replay the Guatemala, Brazil, or Bolivia incidents everywhere. Today, from the Gulf of Mexico to Tierra del Fuego, from Rio de Janeiro to the foothills of the Andes, the flames of anti-colonialism are raging; in the twenty countries of Latin America, only three (Paraguay, Dominican Republic, Cuba) puppet dictatorial regimes remain tottering. Recently, patriots in Venezuela, Haiti, and Cuba have also given a new blow to the US imperialists. The tide of Latin American national independence is unstoppable. Under the situation that the East wind prevails over the West wind, the people of Latin American countries will eventually get rid of American colonial enslavement and plunder and achieve their own independence and freedom.

    美国在拉丁美洲的颠复活动
    萧光
    美国于今年7月22日和9月7日，在委内瑞拉两次策动军事政变，阴谋颠复这个国家的合法政府，企图使被推翻了的亲美独裁政权复辟。在今年7月间，美国还曾在海地策动军事政变；美国的海军陆战队并曾借口“保护水源”，公然宣布准备对古巴进行武装干涉。美国对拉丁美洲国家进行的这些颠复阴谋和武装干涉的活动，由于拉丁美洲和全世界人民的抗议和反对而遭到了可耻的失败，但是这再一次暴露了美国殖民者的狰狞面目。
    长期以来，美国就是以殖民国家的专横态度来对待拉丁美洲各国的。美国强迫拉丁美洲国家各方面的政策都要符合它的殖民利益；否则不是制造叛乱和政变，颠复这些国家的合法政权，就是公然进行武装干涉。
    自从1823年，美国总统门罗发表了他的“门罗主义”以来，美国就利用“美洲是美洲人的美洲”的口号，自封为南北美洲的保护者，在西半球大事扩张。“门罗主义”推行几十年的结果，美洲就由“美洲人的美洲”变成“美国的美洲”了。
    在二十世纪的头三十年里，美国垄断集团为了掠夺巨大的利润，肆无忌惮地派遣海军到中、南美洲，特别是加勒比海峡区域，进行露骨的武装干涉。根据不完整的统计，单是从1898年起的五十年中，美国在拉丁美洲组织了一百多次武装干涉和政变。
    请看美国海军陆战队将领斯沫特莱·巴特勒怎样描写他们在拉丁美洲的任务的吧：
    “1914年，我帮助整顿了墨西哥，特别是坦比哥，以利于美国石油业的开展。我帮助把海地和古巴变为宜于花旗银行收税的地方。……
    我在1902—1912年帮助布朗兄弟国际银行澄清了尼加拉瓜的局势。我在1916年为美国的糖业使多米尼加共和国的局势变为明朗，我在1903年帮助把洪都拉斯变为对美国的果品公司有利。……”
    美国的海盗行径和“大棒”政策，为拉丁美洲人民留下了异常沉痛的回忆。
    墨西哥人忘不了美国在1846—1848年从他们手里夺去了大片土地。
    巴西人记得在1893—1894年的内战时期，美国海军上将宾赫姆曾经怎样指挥美国舰队向当时的起义者开炮，疯狂镇压革命。
    在哥伦比亚，没有人不知道巴拿马正是由于美国在1903—1904年制造的“革命”，才脱离哥伦比亚的，而美国得到的好处是：巴拿马运河宽十英里的狭长地带。
    多米尼加人忘不了美国舰队在1904年对共和国沿岸的扫射。海地和尼加拉瓜人也永远不会忘记美国大兵在他们的国土上，整整驻扎了二十年！……
    三十年代以后，资本主义世界发生的经济危机大大削弱了美国在世界上的地位；美国和拉丁美洲之间政治与经济关系，也由于它的独霸政策变得日趋紧张。当时的美国总统罗斯福为了更有效地对付拉丁美洲各国人民日益增长的民族主义和民主运动，并击败增强了的帝国主义竞争，决定把旧的帝国主义政策改头换面一下，于是提出了“好邻居”政策。但事实上，即使在整个“好邻居”政策时期，美国也没有放弃对拉丁美洲国家内政的干涉和进行武力威胁。在这段时期中，美国曾勾结巴蒂斯塔推翻了古巴的圣马丁政府；策动并参与巴拉圭和玻利维亚争夺盛产石油的格兰查科（大峡谷）战争；在1935—1937年的巴西的瓦加斯政变中，支持反动分子，干涉巴西内政；1938年，以停止收购墨西哥的白银和石油，破坏卡德奈斯政府的国有化纲领……。
    第二次世界大战，对拉丁美洲有着特别深刻的影响。在战争末期和战后最初的年代中，拉丁美洲的人民运动受到反法西斯斗争胜利的鼓舞，在许多国家的政治生活中，表现得相当活跃。在有些国家，民主力量和带有进步倾向的政治力量，甚至取代了独裁政权。例如：危地马拉在1944年发生了推翻乌比哥独裁政权的武装起义；1946年，智利人民阵线在选举中获得胜利；委内瑞拉的民主力量在1947年的选举中得到胜利，并成立了以著名民主作家盖利戈斯为首的政权；另外像巴西、古巴、乌拉圭等国家的进步力量，也在选举中获得重大成就。
    这种形势，对于战后已成为世界新的反动和侵略中心的美国帝国主义，自然是不能容许的。因此，为了保持和加强它对拉丁美洲的控制和掠夺，美国不惜扯掉“好邻居”的外衣，公开以世界宪兵的姿态出现，用种种卑鄙手段绞杀拉丁美洲各国的民主自由和民族独立。
    战后拉丁美洲各国政变之所以接二连三的发生，原因正在于此。据统计，自1948到1958的十年中，美国在拉丁美洲的重大颠复事件就有十四起之多：
    1、1948年10月，美国在秘鲁策动军事政变，使独裁者俄德利亚登台。（但这个暴君终于在1956年6月被人民推翻。）
    2、1948年11月，美国在委内瑞拉策动政变，使独裁暴君希门尼斯登台。（但他终于在1958年1月被人民推翻。）
    3、1948年12月，美国在萨尔瓦多策动政变，使独裁暴君奥索里欧登台。（但他终于在1956年3月被人民推翻。）
    4、1951年5月，美国在玻利维亚策动了以巴伊维昂为首的法西斯政变。（但人民在1952年4月举行武装起义，终于把这个独裁暴君推翻。）
    5、1952年3月，美国在古巴策动政变，使独裁暴君巴蒂斯塔登台。（目前古巴人民正在进行着如火如荼的反对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的武装斗争。）
    6、1954年6月，美国在危地马拉策动阿马斯从洪都拉斯引兵入侵，阿本斯总统被迫去职。（1957年7月，独裁暴君阿马斯被刺身死。）
    7、1954年8月，美国在巴西策动反动军官举行政变，七十一岁的瓦加斯总统被迫自杀。
    8、1954年下半年，美国在墨西哥策划政变阴谋，但被人民粉碎。
    9、1955年1月，美国驱使尼加拉瓜独裁暴君索摩查对哥斯达黎加发动武装进攻，但被击退。
    10、1955年5月，美国在智利策动一个旨在解散议会和建立军事独裁的阴谋，但被民主力量粉碎。
    11、1955年10、11月，美国在巴西策划菲洛—卢斯的政变阴谋，但被人民粉碎。
    12、1958年7月，美国在委内瑞拉策动国防部长卡斯特罗—莱昂举行军事政变，被人民彻底粉碎。
    13、1958年7月，美国在海地策动反动军官举行政变，遭到惨败。
    14、1958年7月，美国在阿根廷策划和指挥以布宜诺斯艾利斯海军军区司令里亚尔为首的反动集团发动军事政变，被人民粉碎。
    从以上的表中可以看出一个特点，即是：任何一个受人民支持的合法政权，美国都要尽一切手段进行破坏，以至搞掉；而为人民所反对和唾弃的傀儡独裁政权，美国无论如何也要把它强加在人民头上。
    美国采取的做法，不外乎以下三种：
    首先是进行政治干涉，控制别国政治力量的发展，使它符合美帝国主义的利益。例子之一就是智利的前魏地拉政权。
    1946年，魏地拉在拥有智利三十万工人为后盾的人民阵线的支持下当选。可是当魏地拉急需华盛顿的五千万美元的贷款时，美国就使出种种无耻手段来诱使他背叛人民阵线。新政权很快就变了质。共产党被宣布为非法，九万个公民被剥夺了选举权；在智利的公务员中实行了美国的“忠诚宣誓”的特务迫害制度；工人运动遭到残酷的镇压；几千名劳工领袖和战士被投进了监狱和集中营。
    美国的第二种做法就是秘密颠复；以美国代理人来取代对它不够顺从的政权。为了实现这个目的，从金钱收买到发动宣传攻势、心理战，从纵火、暗杀到组织政变，以至飞机、舰队的“联合示威”，几乎无所不用。而所有这些活动多半在美国大使的亲自策划和指挥下进行；取代合法政权的傀儡，也全由美国大使馆人员在他们的办公室里“内定”。
    1954年8月，巴西七十一岁的瓦加斯总统，就是牺牲在美国这种魔爪下的。统治巴西近二十年的瓦加斯总统在广大人民的要求下，采取了一些针对美国垄断集团的限制措施。例如成立巴西石油公司；计划没收外国（美国）电力公司，用本国的力量发展发电事业；对外国公司的息金和利润汇出国境重新加以限制；提高最低工资额等。这些措施引起了美国垄断资本集团的狂怒。美国统治集团一方面利用咖啡价格的问题，对瓦加斯政府施加强大的经济压力，使巴西1954年对美输出咖啡较1953年减少了三百三十一万袋，损失三亿美元的外汇，造成巨大的财政赤字。同时，它们在巴西策动政变，阴谋以亲美分子、副总统卡菲·菲洛取代瓦加斯。1954年8月，巴西反动军官集团在美国大使的策划下，公开施加武装压力，甚至出动坦克包围总统府，在首都要冲设置大炮，其势汹汹地逼迫瓦加斯“休假”。七十一岁的瓦加斯终于不堪这重重粗暴压力的胁迫而自杀。
    美国对付拉丁美洲民主政权的更进一步做法，就是策动大规模的武装颠复活动和直接的武装干涉。这方面，1954年发生在危地马拉的事件，是一个突出的例子。
    危地马拉是中美洲一个人口只有三百多万、面积不到十一万平方公里的小国。美国垄断资本集团的美国联合果品公司、中美国际铁路公司和美国危地马拉电业公司控制了这个国家的几乎全部的经济命脉。使危地马拉的人民在美国垄断集团的奴役和控制下，受尽了贫困、鞭打、监禁以至杀戮的折磨。1944年，愤怒的平民和军队中的民主力量，受到反法西斯斗争胜利的鼓舞，举行了推翻独裁政权的武装起义。这次革命缔造了一个资产阶级的民主共和国，使危地马拉开始走向摆脱帝国主义奴役的道路。但美国垄断集团因为危地马拉的新政权不能像从前那样任凭它驱使，恨之入骨。仅在危地马拉首任总统阿雷瓦洛博士的任期内（1945—1951），美国就策动了三十多次颠复阴谋活动。1951年就职的阿本斯政府，为了使国家获得经济上完全的独立，便利本国资本主义的发展，颁布了土地改革法令，另外还采取一些措施限制美国垄断组织对危地马拉经济的统治。这些改革措施触动了美国垄断集团的利益；而使美国更为担心的是危地马拉将为拉丁美洲国家树立反美斗争的榜样。因此美国的统治集团立即大大叫嚷危地马拉已“陷入了国际共产主义”的“掌握”，来为它推翻阿本斯政府的阴谋制造借口。
    美国国务院首先对危地马拉施加外交压力，没有使阿本斯政府屈服，于是美国就收买了危地马拉人民的叛徒阿马斯上校，以每月十五万美元的经费，让他在尼加拉瓜和洪都拉斯招募叛徒和外国雇佣兵，由美国军官进行训练，准备用大规模的武力行动来进行颠复。与此同时，美国通过泛美组织，进行了干涉的准备活动。
    1954年6月，美国代理人阿马斯匪帮在美国的指使下，率领五千人从洪都拉斯分两路向危地马拉进犯，但是遭到危地马拉人民的坚强的抵抗。美帝国主义者看到它所安排的从外部进行武装颠复的计划遇到了困难，便又策划危地马拉的反动军官从内部组织政变。美国报纸并不隐讳，这次军事政变和对危地马拉的武装干涉一样，也是以杜勒斯兄弟为首的美国国务院和中央情报局组织的。当阴谋准备好了的时候，美国驻危地马拉大使普里弗伊便去会见危地马拉的外交部长，公然以最后通牒的形式要求阿本斯政府辞职，“完全清洗”国家机关；同时，反动军人发动叛乱，向阿本斯政府进行胁迫。于是，为危地马拉人民所支持的阿本斯政府就这样被美国公开绞杀了。
    拉丁美洲人从不曾忘记美国殖民主义者历来带给拉丁美洲各国的无数灾难和祸害，他们越来越不容许它再到处重演危地马拉、巴西或是玻利维亚事件。今天，从墨西哥湾到火地岛、从里约热内卢到安第斯山麓，反殖民主义的烽火四起；在拉丁美洲的二十个国家中，傀儡独裁政权只剩下摇摇欲坠的三个（巴拉圭、多米尼加、古巴）。最近委内瑞拉、海地和古巴的爱国者，也给了美帝国主义者一个新的打击。拉丁美洲民族独立的潮流是不可阻挡的。在东风压倒西风的形势下，拉丁美洲各国人民终将挣脱美国的殖民奴役和掠夺，取得自己的独立自由。
