    Two Sets of Military Uniforms

    The Indonesian rebels, transformed into Dutch regular soldiers, makes it very clear where these rebels originally came from.

    The Indonesian rebels put on Dutch uniforms today, and can be said to be Dutch regular soldiers, having taken off their Indonesian rebel uniforms. Of course, when the time comes, these Dutch regular soldiers can change back into Indonesian rebel uniforms.

    All Handled by One Party

    The British "New Statesman" weekly revealed that Britain is instigating Israel to occupy the West Bank of Jordan, or at least threaten to attack the East Bank, so that Britain can use this as an excuse to refuse to withdraw its troops from Jordan.

    Britain yesterday marched into Jordan under the pretext of preventing the so-called "indirect aggression" against Jordan that it fabricated. This was shameless enough. Today, Britain is even plotting to use the direct aggression against Jordan that it planned as an excuse for refusing to end its direct aggression against Jordan. This is even more shameless.

    Specially Permitted

    American soldiers publicly tore up the Turkish flag in Turkey, but Turkish military police could do nothing about it, supposedly because they had not received "special permission" to arrest them.

    The fundamental reason is that the Turkish government is a traitorous American lackey, giving the American occupiers "special permission" to arbitrarily insult Turkey.

    两套军装
    印度尼西亚的叛军，摇身一变成了荷兰的正规军，这些叛军原属何处，就十分明白了。
    印度尼西亚叛军今天穿上了荷兰的军装，也可以说是荷兰的正规军，脱下了印度尼西亚叛军的军装。而当然时机一到这些荷兰的正规军又可以再换回印度尼西亚叛军的军装。
    一手包办
    英国“新政治家”周刊揭露，英国正在怂恿以色列侵占约旦西岸或者至少以进攻东岸相威胁，以便英国可以借此拒绝从约旦撤军。
    英国昨天是借口防止它所捏造的所谓对约旦的“间接侵略”而进军约旦的。这是够无耻的了。英国今天竟阴谋以它所策划的对约旦的直接侵略作为不肯中止它对约旦的直接侵略的借口。这就更加无耻。
    特别允许
    美国兵在土耳其公然撕毁土耳其的国旗，土耳其的军警竟奈何他们不得，据说因为没有得到逮捕他们的“特别允许”。
    根本的原因是土耳其政府是卖国求荣的美国走狗，它给予了美国占领者任意污辱土耳其的“特别允许”。
