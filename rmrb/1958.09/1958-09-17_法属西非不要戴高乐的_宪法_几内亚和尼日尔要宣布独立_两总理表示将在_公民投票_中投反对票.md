Xinhua News Agency, September 16th Dispatch from Paris: The Prime Minister of French Guinea, Sékou Touré, and the Prime Minister of French Niger, Bakari, have stated that their countries will vote against De Gaulle's draft "Constitution" in the "referendum" on September 28th, which seeks to keep them bound by the shackles of colonialism, and will resolutely demand the right to independence.

    On September 14th, at a special representative meeting of the Guinea Democratic Party held in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, Guinean Prime Minister Sékou Touré said that all residents of Guinea should vote against France's new draft "Constitution." He pointed out that this constitutional draft was "merely a change of label," and "it neither gives Africa freedom of action nor gives Africa equal status with France." He said: "We will vote against this illegal and irresponsible practice."

    Touré demanded immediate independence for Guinea. He said: "From September 29th, we will become an independent country. We will take over all responsibility for governing ourselves." It is believed that these words are in effect a "declaration of independence." The special meeting, convened to discuss the Guinea Democratic Party's attitude toward the "referendum," passed a resolution. The resolution emphasized that De Gaulle's draft "Constitution" is contrary to the vital interests of the people of all African countries. The resolution called on European residents and blacks in French colonies, all political organizations and trade unions, and youth groups to reject this "Constitution" draft in order to save Africa's future.

    In addition to representatives of the Guinea Democratic Party organizations, representatives from other French overseas territories attended the meeting, including Chad Territory Government Committee Chairman Lisette and French West Africa Grand Council member Jean-Marie Koné.

    Meanwhile, Niger Prime Minister Bakari, after attending the African People's Union Steering Committee meeting held in Niamey, told reporters: "Niger will vote against it on September 28th." He also said: "Niger will become an independent country."

    According to Agence France-Presse, many people in French West Africa strongly oppose De Gaulle's draft "Constitution." In Senegal, those advocating immediate and complete independence are particularly active. Madagascar's two largest trade union organizations have also expressed their opposition to De Gaulle's draft "Constitution."

    法属西非不要戴高乐的“宪法”
    几内亚和尼日尔要宣布独立
    两总理表示将在“公民投票”中投反对票
    新华社16日讯　巴黎消息：法属几内亚总理塞古·杜尔和法属尼日尔总理巴卡里表示，他们的国家在9月28日举行的“公民投票”中将投票反对要它们继续受殖民枷锁束缚的戴高乐“宪法”草案，而坚决要求享有独立的权利。
    几内亚总理塞古·杜尔14日在几内亚首府科纳克里举行的几内亚民主党特别代表会议上说，几内亚的全体居民都应当投票反对法国的新“宪法”草案。他指出，这个宪法草案“只不过换了个商标”，“它既没有给非洲以行动自由，又没有给非洲以对法国的平等地位”。他说：“我们要投票反对这种非法的不负责任的做法”。
    杜尔要求立即让几内亚独立。他说：“从9月29日起我们将成为一个独立国家。我们将把管理我们的全部责任接收过来。”人们认为，这番话实际是“独立宣言”。为讨论几内亚民主党对“公民投票”的态度而召开的这次特别会议通过了一项决议。决议强调指出，戴高乐的“宪法”草案是违反非洲各国人民的切身利益的。决议呼吁法国殖民地的欧洲籍居民和黑人、一切政治组织和工会以及青年团体都为了拯救非洲的前途而否决这个“宪法”草案。
    出席这次会议的除了几内亚民主党组织的代表外，还有法属其他海外领地的代表，其中包括乍得领地政府委员会主席利泽特和法属西非大议会议员让—马里·科奈。
    同时，法属领地尼日尔总理巴卡里在参加了在尼亚美举行的非洲人民联盟指导委员会会议之后，对记者说：“尼日尔在9月28日将投反对票。”他还说：“尼日尔将成为一个独立的国家。”
    据法新社报道，法属西非洲有许多人强烈反对戴高乐的“宪法”草案。在塞内加尔，主张立即彻底独立的人特别活跃。马达加斯加两个最大的工会组织也表示反对戴高乐的“宪法”草案。
