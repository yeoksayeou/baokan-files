    Welcoming the Asian-African Writers' Conference
    Gē Bǎoquán
    According to the decision of the Preparatory Committee of the Asian-African Writers' Conference, the Asian-African Writers' Conference will be held in Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, on October 7th this year.

    Recalling the first Asian Writers' Conference held in New Delhi in December 1956, Uzbek writers, representing writers from the Soviet East and Central Asian republics, suggested at the meeting that the next conference be held in Tashkent. This suggestion was immediately warmly welcomed by writers from various countries attending the meeting. At the Asian-African Solidarity Conference held in Cairo at the end of last year, a proposal was also adopted calling on writers from various countries attending the conference to actively prepare for the conference to be held in Tashkent, which became a good start for convening the Asian-African Writers' Conference.

    In February of this year, the Soviet Union first established the Preparatory Committee of the Asian-African Writers' Conference, with the famous Uzbek writer Rashidov as chairman, to carry out various preparations. In early June, writers' representatives from China, India, the United Arab Republic, the Soviet Union, and Japan held a preparatory meeting in Moscow and issued a communiqué on convening the Asian-African Writers' Conference and a letter to Asian-African writers. From September 8th to 10th, writers' representatives from ten countries including China, Burma, India, Indonesia, Cameroon, Mongolia, the Soviet Union, Thailand, Ceylon, and Japan gathered in Tashkent, and under the chairmanship of Cameroonian writer Benjamin Matip, discussed issues related to the conference's agenda and duration, reaching a consensus.

    After receiving a letter from the Soviet Preparatory Committee of the Asian-African Writers' Conference in April of this year, the Chinese Writers Association immediately responded to the call for convening the Asian-African Writers' Conference, actively carried out preparations, and successively sent representatives to attend the preparatory meetings held in Moscow and Tashkent. The "Translation" magazine edited two issues of "Special Issues on Asian-African Literature"; the People's Literature Publishing House successively published literary works by Asian and African writers, most of which were translated into Chinese for the first time. Recently, the Chinese Writers Association is also preparing to send a delegation, including writers from our country's ethnic minorities, to Tashkent to participate in the upcoming Asian-African Writers' Conference.

    The convening of the Asian-African Writers' Conference will not only unfold a new glorious page in the history of literary development in Asian and African countries, but will also become a major event in the history of friendship between the people of Asian and African countries. Historically speaking, there is a long-standing relationship of friendship and cultural exchange between the people of Asian and African countries. As early as hundreds of years before the Christian era, the famous "Silk Road" closely linked our country with the countries of the Near and Middle East. Zhang Qian passed through the Western Regions in the second century BC, and Xuanzang went to India to fetch Buddhist scriptures in the seventh century. To this day, Xuanzang's name is closely linked to India's Nalanda Temple, and traces of Sino-Indian cultural exchanges can still be seen in the murals and sculptures of the Ajanta Caves in India and the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, China. As for the relationship between our country and Korea, Japan, Vietnam and other countries, it is even closer. From a literary point of view, Asian and African literature also have glorious traditions. Whether it is China's "Book of Songs" or Japan's "Manyoshu"; whether it is Egypt's "Book of the Dead" or India's epics "Mahabharata" and "Ramayana"; whether it is the Arabian fairy tale "One Thousand and One Nights" or the quatrains of ancient Iranian poets; whether it is the "Khamsa" of the great Azerbaijani poet Nizami or the great Uzbek poet Navoi..., all have long become precious legacies in the world's literary and cultural treasury. From the point of view of opposing colonialism and striving for national liberation, in the past hundred years, the awakened people of Asian and African countries have been carrying out continuous and heroic struggles to strive for their national independence and defend their national cultural traditions. In recent years, we have supported the anti-colonial struggles of the people of Egypt and the people of the Near and Middle Eastern countries, and when US imperialism recently carried out new military provocations in the Taiwan Strait of our country, the people of Asian and African countries supported our just struggle. All this is the best proof of the close unity of the people of Asian and African countries.

    Because of this, the convening of the Asian-African Writers' Conference is of great significance. It will make great contributions to the cause of defending world peace and to the cause of mutual understanding, friendly unity, and cultural exchange between writers and people of Asian and African countries. As the writers of Asian and African countries are about to hold their first historic meeting in Tashkent, we warmly welcome the convening of this conference and wish it success!

    迎接亚非作家会议
    戈宝权
    根据亚非作家会议筹备委员会的决定，今年10月7日，将在苏联乌兹别克共和国的首都塔什干举行亚非作家会议。
    回想1956年12月在新德里举行第一次亚洲作家会议时，乌兹别克作家曾代表苏联东方和中亚各共和国的作家们，在会上提出建议，希望下一次的会议在塔什干举行，这个建议立即得到参加会议的各国作家的热烈欢迎。去年年底，在开罗召开的亚非团结大会上又通过了一项建议，号召到会的各国作家积极准备参加在塔什干举行的会议，这就成了召开亚非作家会议的良好的开端。
    今年2月间，苏联首先成立了亚非作家会议筹备委员会，由乌兹别克名作家拉希多夫任主席，进行各项准备工作。6月初旬，中国、印度、阿联、苏联和日本等五国的作家代表在莫斯科举行筹备会议，发表了召开亚非作家会议的公报和告亚非作家书。9月8日至10日，中国、缅甸、印度、印度尼西亚、喀麦隆、蒙古、苏联、泰国、锡兰、日本等十国的作家代表又在塔什干聚会，在喀麦隆作家班加明·马吉普的主持之下，讨论了有关会议的日程和会期等问题，取得了一致的意见。
    中国作家协会在今年4月间收到亚非作家会议苏联筹备委员会的来信之后，立即响应了召开亚非作家会议的号召，积极进行准备工作，并先后派遣了代表出席参加在莫斯科和塔什干举行的筹备会议。“译文”杂志编辑了两期“亚非国家文学专号”；人民文学出版社陆续出版了亚非各国作家的文学作品，其中大部分都是初次被译成中文的。最近中国作家协会又正在准备派遣包括有我国少数民族的作家在内的代表团，前往塔什干参加即将召开的亚非作家会议。
    亚非作家会议的召开，不仅将在亚非各国文学发展的历史上展开新的光辉的一页，同时也将成为亚非各国人民的友好历史上的一件重大的事件。从历史上来讲，亚非各国人民之间是有着悠久的友谊和文化交流的关系的。远在纪元前的几百年，著名的“丝绸之路”就把我国和中近东各国紧密地联系起来。张骞曾在纪元前二世纪通过西域，玄奘又在七世纪到印度去取过经，直到今天，玄奘的名字和印度的那烂陀寺紧连在一起，而从印度阿旃陀石窟和我国敦煌千佛洞的壁画与雕刻当中，还依然看到中印文化交流的痕迹。至于我国和朝鲜、日本、越南等国的关系，就更为密切。从文学上来讲，亚非各国文学也是有着光辉的传统的。无论是我国的“诗经”，还是日本的“万叶集”；无论是埃及的“亡灵书”，还是印度的史诗“摩珂波罗多”和“罗摩衍那”；无论是阿拉伯的神话故事“一千零一夜”，还是古代伊朗诗人们的四行诗；无论是阿塞拜疆大诗人尼扎米或者是乌兹别克大诗人纳瓦伊的“五诗集”……，都早已成为全世界文学和文化宝库中的珍贵的遗产。再从反对殖民主义和争取民族解放的斗争来讲，近一百年来，觉醒了的亚非各国人民进行着不断的英勇的斗争，争取自己的民族独立，保卫自己的民族文化的传统。近年来，我们曾声援过埃及人民和中近东国家的人民的反殖民主义的斗争，而当最近美帝国主义在我国台湾海峡进行新的军事挑衅时，亚非各国的人民又声援了我们的正义斗争事业，这一切都是亚非各国人民紧密团结的最好明证。
    正因为这样，亚非作家会议的召开就具有非常重大的意义。它对于保卫世界和平事业，对于亚非各国作家和人民之间的相互了解、友好团结与文化交流的事业，都将作出巨大的贡献。当此亚非各国作家即将在塔什干举行历史上的第一次大会见时，我们热烈地欢迎这次会议的召开，并预祝它获得成功！
