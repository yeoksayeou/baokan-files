　　The School of Praising Hard Study
　　Lin Yi
    The story of Li Shimei, the termite expert, is well known. In order to find an effective method of controlling termites, he spent three years reading through entomology and related literature on termites. After thousands of experiments and summaries, he finally uncovered the secrets of the termite world. He proposed methods to eradicate termites and became an expert beneficial to the people. This kind of arduous research process can be called the school of hard study. Not long ago, there was an amazing performance in Beijing. On stage appeared such artists: those who had lost both hands could still play the piano freely, those who had only one hand left could still play melodious flute music... The performers were the extracurricular performance team of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Servicemen's Sanatorium. When you know how they endured physical pain and how much effort they put in, before they could perform a song for you today, can you not shed tears of joy for their success? Another example is Gao Yu Bao, who is well known to everyone. He originally only knew how to write a little over a hundred characters, but after arduous struggle and learning, he wrote an autobiographical novel of two to three hundred thousand words. Similar examples could go on and on. In all parts of our great motherland, the people who can be called the school of hard study are too numerous to mention.
    The characteristics of the school of hard study are: first, they have a noble purpose, which is to do things that are beneficial to the people. Burning in their hearts is the glorious flame of communism, not the selfish desires of individualism; second, they are not inferior, do not believe in anything blindly, and are not afraid of anything. They believe in their own strength, believe in the strength of people. The reason why they are able to do this is because they have the support of the Party and the people, and they regard this support as higher than everything else; third, they are serious about their work. Whatever they do, they do it wholeheartedly. They have learned from long-term labor that difficulties are most afraid of "seriousness." As long as you study seriously and work seriously, there is nothing in the world that you cannot learn and nothing that you cannot do well. In the members of the school of hard study, one can clearly see the character of our great nation.
    The school of hard study is indeed undergoing all kinds of hardships when they are struggling with the enemy of learning with painstaking effort. But they do not flaunt this, nor do they regard it as a remarkable hardship. On the contrary, their hearts are filled with the infinite joy aroused by creation, struggle, and overcoming difficulties. The school of hard study has nothing to do with those asceticists who have become stupid because of superstition and absurdity. They are revolutionary optimists. They are "wearing out their scalps and wearing down their heels to benefit the world." When Li Shimei uncovered the secrets of the termite kingdom and saw that his labor was linked to the safety of millions of houses and bridges, what joy could compare to this? Only those who regard fighting against difficulties as a joy can create miracles in the world.
    I praise the school of hard study. Today, the school of hard study is forming an invincible army, acting as the vanguard of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, advancing bravely to win the complete victory of socialist construction.

　　颂苦学派
　　林伊
    白蚁专家李始美的事迹是大家都知道的。他为了找到除治白蚁的有效方法，三年里面遍读昆虫学和有关白蚁的文献，经过千百次试验总结，终于揭开了白蚁世界的秘密。提出了根治白蚁的办法，成为对人民有益的专家。就这种艰苦的钻研过程来说，是可以称之为苦学派的。不久前在北京有过一次惊人的演奏，舞台上出现了这样的艺术家：失去双手也能弹琴自如，只剩下一只手也能奏出悠扬的笛声……。演出者是四川省革命残废军人教养院的课余演出队。当你知道他们曾是怎样地熬过生理的痛苦，绞出多少心血，今天才能给你演奏一支歌曲时，你能不为他们的成功流出欢欣的眼泪吗？又如早为大家熟知的高玉宝，本来只会写一百多个字，经过艰苦的奋斗和学习，写成了一部二三十万字的自传体小说。类似的例子可以一直写下去。在我们伟大祖国的四面八方，可以称为苦学派的人物是举不胜举的。
    苦学派的特点是：第一，有一个崇高的目的，就是要作出对人民有益的事情。在他们心底燃烧的是共产主义的光辉的火焰，而不是个人主义的私欲；第二，他们不自卑，不迷信什么，不害怕什么。他们相信自己的力量，相信人的力量。他们所以能够如此，是因为有党和人民的支持，而他们是把这种支持看得高于一切的；第三，他们做事认真。无论干什么，总是全心全意。他们从长期的劳动中得出一条经验：困难最怕“认真”。只要你认真地去学，认真地去干，天下没有学不会和干不好的事情。在苦学派的身上，能够清楚地看出我们伟大的民族性格。
    苦学派在呕心沥血跟学习的敌人进行搏斗时，确是千辛万苦的。但他们并不炫耀这一点，也不把它看成是了不起的苦事。相反地，在他们心里充满着由于创造、斗争、战胜困难所激起的无限欢乐。苦学派跟那些由于迷信虚诞而变得蠢头呆脑的苦修主义者毫不相干，他们是革命的乐观主义者，他们是“摩顶放踵，利天下为之”。当李始美揭开白蚁王国的秘密，看到自己的劳动与千百万房宇和一栋一栋桥梁的安危联在一起的时候，还能有什么欢乐可以与此相比呢？把与困难作斗争视为乐事的人才能创造出人世的奇迹。
    我歌颂苦学派。在今天，苦学派正在形成一支所向披靡的大军，充当着技术革命和文化革命的急先锋，一往直前地去争取社会主义建设事业的彻底胜利。
