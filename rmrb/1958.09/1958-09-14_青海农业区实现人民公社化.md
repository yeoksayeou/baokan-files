Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 10th -- After ten days and nights of deliberation and active preparation, all eleven counties and cities in Qinghai Province's agricultural area have realized people's communes, establishing a total of ninety-four people's communes. The percentage of peasant households joining the communes has reached 100%.

The communes average 2,454 households each, which is twenty-four times larger than the average number of households in the original agricultural cooperatives. The largest commune has reached 13,401 households.

The scale and speed of the people's commune movement in Qinghai Province's agricultural area far exceeds that of the agricultural collectivization period. The reasons for this are: First, in this year's great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the broad masses of peasants have deeply realized that small townships and small cooperatives, and the situation of one township with multiple cooperatives, have insurmountable difficulties in the unified allocation of labor, the raising of material and financial resources, and the use of technical forces. They had long had the desire to expand townships and merge into large cooperatives. Second, Qinghai Province has a large area and a small population, and the shortage of labor is even more prominent. However, the sowing and ripening periods in the mountains and plains often differ by one to two months. If they can cooperate or unite into one cooperative, they can fully unleash their labor potential. Third, the superiority of advanced agricultural cooperatives, especially after last year's rural rectification, has greatly strengthened the determination of the broad masses of peasants to establish people's communes.

    青海农业区实现人民公社化
    据新华社西宁10日电　经过十昼夜的酝酿讨论和积极筹备，青海省农业区十一个县市已全部实现人民公社化，共办起了九十四个人民公社。入社农户达到百分之百。
    各地公社平均每社二千四百五十四户，比原来农业社的平均户数大了二十四倍。最大的公社达到一万三千四百零一户。
    青海省农业区人民公社运动的规模和速度，远远超过了农业合作化时期。其原因是：一、广大农民在今年的工农业生产大跃进中，深深地觉察到小乡小社、一乡多社，不论劳力的统一调配、物力财力的筹集以及技术力量使用都存在着难以克服的困难，很早就有了扩乡并大社的要求。二、青海省地多人少，劳动力不足现象更加突出。但山地和平原的播种期、成熟期往往相差一两个月，如果能够协作，或是联合成一个社，就可以充分发挥劳动潜力。三、高级农业合作化的优越性，特别是经过了去年的农村整风，大大坚定了广大农民办人民公社的决心。
