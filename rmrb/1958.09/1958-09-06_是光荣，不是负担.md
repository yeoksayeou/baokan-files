　　A Glory, Not a Burden
　　Ying Lin
　　Since the raising of the red flag in Xuzhou City with the slogan "Marching Towards a City Without Paupers," representatives from various provinces, cities, and towns across the country have been flocking to visit and learn. In the initial period, some staff members of the Xuzhou Civil Affairs Bureau regarded receiving visitors as a burden, believing that it would affect their work, and therefore displayed a sense of annoyance and indifference. This situation was noticed by the Xuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Secretary of the Municipal Committee and the Mayor personally instructed the Civil Affairs Bureau to warmly receive and patiently introduce the situation to the visitors. They were instructed to assign a bureau director and a section chief to manage this matter, and were told that this work must be done well and not poorly. The Xuzhou Civil Affairs Bureau conscientiously implemented this instruction, corrected the incorrect attitude of individual staff members, and ensured that visitors came happily and left satisfied.
　　The responsible cadres of Xuzhou City acted very correctly, because they understand that when an individual or a unit has new experiences or new creations, it is certainly a contribution to the collective and the country. However, if this new experience or new creation cannot be disseminated, then no matter how valuable the experience or how significant the creation, it is only a seed that has not been sown, and will neither germinate and blossom nor bear fruit. The so-called contribution would then be very limited. Conversely, if this new experience or new creation can be disseminated, the result will be "one seed into the ground, ten thousand grains into the barn." The small wealth of one person or one unit will become the collective and national wealth of the people. How can the former type of contribution be compared with this kind of contribution?
　　Of course, in order to receive visitors, it is necessary to spend a considerable amount of time and manpower, which will more or less affect one's own production and work. This is certain. Taking the Xuzhou Civil Affairs Bureau as an example, this bureau assigned five cadres to manage this work exclusively to receive the visiting representatives of more than two hundred units, from early May to the end of July. For the Xuzhou Civil Affairs Bureau, this cannot but be a "loss." The question is how to view this "loss." If only viewed from a parochial perspective, this "loss" is certainly great, and a feeling of annoyance will inevitably arise. If one can think from the overall perspective, this "loss" seems very small, even insignificant, because the small loss of one's own unit is incomparable to the great gain of the whole country. In this way, there can be no feeling of annoyance, nor will one feel that it is a burden. If there is any burden, it is a reasonable "burden," a glorious "burden," a "burden" to fulfill one's responsibility to build communism!
　　The units being visited should learn from Xuzhou's communist spirit of thinking for the visitors. Conversely, the visiting units should also have a communist spirit of thinking for the units being visited. It is certainly good to learn from the advanced experiences of others, but it is not good to only think about the convenience of one's own learning without thinking about the inconvenience it may cause to the unit being visited. This requires the visiting units to organize visiting teams reasonably and, while ensuring the premise of learning advanced experiences, to reduce the burden of receiving visitors for the units being visited as much as possible, and to minimize the impact on the normal work of the units being visited.
　　In any case, on any issue, one should not only think about the part, but also think about the whole; one should not only think about oneself, but also think about others. This is the true communist spirit.

　　是光荣，不是负担
　　应麟
    徐州市“向没有贫民的城市前进”的红旗树立起来以后，全国各省市、各城镇派代表前往参观学习的络绎不绝。最初一个时期，徐州市民政局的个别工作人员，把接待参观者看成一种负担，认为这会影响他们的工作，因而表现出一种厌烦和冷淡的情绪。这个情况被中共徐州市委发觉了，市委书记和市长都曾亲自指示民政局，对前往参观的人必须热情接待，耐心介绍，要他们派一位局长和一位科长管这件事，而且告诉他们这件工作只许作好，不许作坏。徐州市民政局认真地执行了这个指示，纠正了个别工作人员不正确的态度，作到了使参观的人高兴而来，满意而去。
    徐州市的负责干部作得很对，因为他们懂得：一个人、一个单位有了新的经验、新的创造，这对集体对全国，固然是个贡献，可是，如果这个新经验、新创造不能传播出去，那末不管这个经验多么宝贵，这个创造多么重大，也只不过是一粒没有播种的种籽，既不能发芽开花，更不会有所收获。所谓贡献，也就有限得很了。相反，要是这个新经验、新创造能够传播出去，结果是“一籽入地，万粒归仓”，一个人的、一个单位的小财富，就会变成集体的、全国人民的大财富。前面的那种贡献有什么办法和这种贡献相比呢？
    当然，为了接待参观访问的人，必须花费相当的时间和人力，也会或多或少影响自己的生产和工作。这是一定的。即以徐州市民政局为例，这个局为了接待二百多个单位的参观代表，从5月初到7月底，即有五个干部专管这项工作。对徐州市民政局来说，这不能不是一个“损失”。问题是怎样看待这种“损失”。如果仅仅从本位着眼，这个“损失”当然很大，厌烦的情绪一定会产生；如果能从全局着想，这个“损失”就显得很小，甚至小到微不足道，因为本单位的损失之小同全国的收获之大，差得无法比拟。这样就不可能有什么厌烦的情绪，也不会感到是什么负担。如果说有什么负担的话，那也是一种合理的“负担”，光荣的“负担”，尽自己建设共产主义应尽责任的“负担”！
    被参观的单位，应该学习徐州这种为参观者着想的共产主义精神。反过来，参观的单位，也应该有为被参观单位着想的共产主义精神。自己学习别人的先进经验，当然很好，但是，如果只是想到自己学习的方便，而不去想会给被参观单位造成的不便，就不好了。这就要求参观的单位有必要合理地组织参观的队伍，在保证学习先进经验的前提下，尽可能减轻被参观单位接待参观的负担，尽可能少影响被参观单位的正常工作。
    不管在任何情况下，不管在任何问题上，不光想局部，更要想全局，不光想自己，更要想别人，这才是真正的共产主义精神。
