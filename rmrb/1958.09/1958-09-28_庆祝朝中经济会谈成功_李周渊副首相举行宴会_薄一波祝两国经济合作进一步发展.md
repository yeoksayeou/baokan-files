Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: Korean Democratic People's Republic Government Delegation leader Vice Premier Li Juyuan held a banquet in Beijing tonight to celebrate the success of the Sino-Korean economic cooperation talks and the signing of the long-term trade agreement and loan agreement between the two countries.

	Vice Premier Li Juyuan said at the beginning of the banquet: The signing of these agreements will make a great contribution to the further development of economic cooperation between the two countries and the further consolidation of the friendship between the two peoples cemented with blood.
	The Vice Premier said: The fraternal Chinese people not only aided the Korean people with blood in the most difficult war period, but also aided us materially and spiritually during the post-war construction period. Today, they have once again given our country the material assistance needed for socialist construction. These facts will encourage the Korean people to work harder to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland, better complete the first five-year plan for socialist construction, and further develop economic cooperation between the two countries.
	In his speech tonight, Vice Premier Li Juyuan once again severely condemned the US imperialism's military provocations against China. He said: The people of China and Korea will forever advance shoulder to shoulder in the struggle to thwart US imperialist war provocations and strive for peace in Asia and the world and the territorial integrity of their motherlands, and they must drive the US imperialist aggressors out of the Taiwan area and the southern half of Korea.
	Vice Premier Bo Yibo said in his speech at the banquet: China and Korea are the closest neighbors. In the struggle against imperialist aggression, the people of the two countries have cemented an unbreakable friendship with blood; in the struggle to build socialism, we have supported each other and cooperated closely. The achievements made in this meeting will further strengthen the economic relations between China and Korea and the friendly relations between the two peoples, and will have important significance for promoting the socialist construction of the two countries on the basis of self-reliance, further leaping forward, and enhancing the unity and strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
	He said: Under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the government, the Korean people are striding forward on the Chollima with soaring enthusiasm, building socialism, and carrying out unremitting struggles for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The Chinese people, who are making a great leap forward in socialist construction, are as infinitely happy about every achievement made by the Korean people as they are about their own achievements. I wish our two countries' economic relations and friendly cooperation will be more consolidated and developed on the basis of the great leap forward in socialist construction in both countries, and the eternal friendship between the two peoples will be even more brilliant.
	Among those invited to attend tonight's banquet were Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade, Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Liu Mingfu, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, and Lin Haiyun, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, and many others.
	The entire staff of the Korean government delegation and the Ambassador to our country, Li Yonghao, attended the banquet.
	At the banquet, the hosts and guests constantly warmly congratulated the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people and the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
