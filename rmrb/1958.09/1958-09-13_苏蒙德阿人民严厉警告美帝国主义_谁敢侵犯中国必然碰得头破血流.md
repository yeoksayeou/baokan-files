Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 12th: The provocative actions of U.S. imperialism in the coastal areas of China have aroused immense anger among the Soviet people. In recent days, tens of thousands of working people across the Soviet Union have continued to hold protest rallies.

	Forgeman Laansalu said at a mass rally in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, "We assure the Party and the government that we will resolutely support all measures aimed at safeguarding peace and security in the Far East. We unanimously demand that the Americans get out of Taiwan!"

	The workers of the Moscow Watch Factory said in their unanimously adopted resolution, "We want to remind the American aggressors that the Soviet and Chinese people have extremely rich experience in crushing and driving out aggressors, including the United States."

	The aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people have infuriated the Ukrainian people. Davydov, a lathe operator at the Kiev Carriage Repair Factory, said at the factory's protest rally, "U.S. imperialism should remember that if it ignites the flames of war in the Far East, the Soviet and Chinese people will fight shoulder to shoulder."

	In Alma-Ata, the capital of the Kazakh Republic, near China's western border, workers at a shoe factory held a protest rally. Worker Dosmukhanbetov said, "We firmly support our government's policy and will do everything in our power to defend the security of China and the Soviet Union."

	In addition, news of mass protest rallies has been received from Tallinn, Riga, Minsk, Tashkent, Tbilisi, and other cities in the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, September 12th: In recent days, this reporter has heard voices of Mongolian party and government leaders at all levels and the Mongolian people everywhere on the western Mongolian grasslands protesting against the U.S. imperialists' military provocations against China and supporting the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.

	In the Khangai Province, Lubsang Hündeb, First Secretary of the Provincial Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, told reporters that the peace-loving Mongolian people love fraternal China and the Chinese people, and support China's liberation of its territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands.

	Sambuu, the Vice Governor of Övörkhangai Province, told reporters that the Mongolian people resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's occupation of China's territory of Taiwan. Recently, U.S. imperialism has created tension in the Taiwan Strait, further arousing the anger of the Mongolian people. We firmly support the just struggle of the Chinese people. Dorjsuren, the director of the 21-year-old "Bright Road" cooperative, said that the 1,200-plus members of the "Bright Road" cooperative, along with the people of the whole country, resolutely protest against U.S. imperialism's aggressive actions against China, and fully believe that the strength of the Chinese people can recover their territory.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 11th: In recent days, the working people of various places in the German Democratic Republic have been holding rallies or writing letters to the Chinese Embassy in the German Democratic Republic, angrily protesting against the U.S. imperialists' outrageous provocations against China, and resolutely supporting the Chinese people's just struggle for the liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands.

	The Suhl District Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany, representing 500,000 working people in the district, wrote to the Chinese Embassy expressing sympathy and support for the Chinese people's struggle.

	Workers at the Neubrandenburg State-Owned Repair Factory expressed their firm solidarity with the Chinese people at a rally. Marie Glentzmann, a female deputy technician at the Zeiss factory, said at a rally, "We express our heartfelt sympathy and full support for the Chinese people's just struggle. In order to oppose U.S. imperialism's war provocations in the Far East, we must improve the quality of products exported to People's China."

	A letter from the workers of the Halle State-Owned Machine Manufacturing Factory to the Chinese Embassy stated that, like Hitler, U.S. imperialism wants to impose war on humanity, but this is not 1933, and the peace-loving people already have enough power to stop the war.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, September 11th: The Albanian newspaper "Unity" selected three letters from worker and peasant readers condemning the U.S. imperialists' provocative behavior in the Taiwan Strait, and placed them on the front page under the headline. In an editor's note, it wrote: These letters from workers and cooperative members to the editorial department express the hatred and extreme indignation of the Albanian workers and peasants towards the American aggressors.

	Workers Taravani, Mina, and Agiaya from the No. 2 Construction Site in Tirana jointly wrote to "Unity" saying, "The Albanian people and we construction workers all shout in unison: 'U.S. imperialists get out of Taiwan and stop provocations against China!'"

	A. Kolamez, Chairman of the Agricultural Cooperative in the village of Reboreke in Korca Prefecture, wrote in a letter that we believe: Every aggressive plan of the U.S. imperialists against China will meet with a shameful defeat.

	Maraj, Chairman of the Balsher Agricultural Cooperative, pointed out in his letter that no one can conquer the fraternal Chinese people's will to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands. The aggressors can never shake the great China, but can only smash their heads against it.

	On the same day, "Warrior" also published an article by Army Captain S. Tafai condemning the U.S. imperialists' shameful provocative actions. The article wrote that if imperialism dares to touch China, it will pay a heavy price.
