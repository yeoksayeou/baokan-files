New Developments in Rural Literacy in Qinghai
By our reporters Zhao Huaiqing and Yang Liben

	One Day Equals Twenty Years

	Fan Zukui, a young member of Fengsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Huangzhong County, entered a people's school in 1954 but only learned more than twenty characters in four years. However, he recently shed his illiteracy in just half a month. People say, "The General Line has opened people's minds; one day can equal twenty years."

	Fan Zukui, nicknamed Wushiliu ("Fifty-Six"), was known as the "stupid one" in the cooperative. Initially, the people's school organized him to join a literacy crash course, but his father, old man Fan Yongyuan, disagreed, saying that his son was stupid and wouldn't learn, and would only delay work. Some young men also said, "If Wushiliu can learn well, we won't eat." Teacher Qiao Yuxi persuaded his father, criticized the young men who ridiculed him, and said to him, "As long as you are willing to learn, I will teach you a thousand times if you ask a thousand times."

	When Fan Zukui recognized the first batch of characters, the teacher praised him: "Who says you're stupid? Aren't you learning well?" He also said: "There are no stupid people among the working people, only those who don't study diligently." Once Fan Zukui started studying seriously, he became obsessed, sometimes forgetting to eat, forgetting to sleep, and sometimes sweating profusely to remember a single new character. He asked whenever he didn't understand, asking anyone he encountered. The teacher used more than a dozen methods to teach him, such as recognizing characters by seeing objects, lining up homophones and synonyms, and separating and combining the parts of characters. Initially, he could recognize thirty or forty characters a day, but later he could recognize two hundred characters a day.

	On the night Fan Zukui graduated from the literacy class, the people's school held a meeting. At the meeting, the teacher selected several hundred relatively difficult characters from the textbook and tested Fan Zukui in public, proving that he could recognize, read, explain, and write them. He also talked to everyone about his hard-working experience. Everyone present was educated. Old man Fan Yongyuan also said: "In the past, my view of my son was wrong. My old almanac is no longer effective."

	A Cultural Family

	In the dead of night, whose house is still brightly lit? The members of Hongguang Cooperative in Shuimo Township, Xining, say: "It's old man Hu Zhan'ao's family learning culture. His family of eight, except for his wife and third son who are blind, he, his two sons, and three daughters-in-law have all shed their illiteracy in two months."

	People say that Hu Zhan'ao's family is a cultural family. Old man Hu Zhan'ao is over sixty years old and still takes the lead in learning culture. He prepared a smoothed stone slab and mixed red earth juice for each member of the family, so that everyone could practice writing. None of the three daughters-in-law wanted to fall behind. The eldest daughter-in-law, Li Junying, could recognize more than sixty characters a day. The third daughter-in-law, Wu Xingmei, said: "I will recognize eighty characters a day and definitely catch up with you." After returning from a day of work, they would test each other until late at night.

	The blind old woman took on all the housework in order to free up her daughters-in-law to learn culture. If she heard anyone reading while pulling the bellows, she would go over and take over the bellows. There were three unweaned babies in the family, and the children's cries rose and fell when their mothers went to night school. The old woman would feel her way from one room to another, coaxing this one and holding that one. She couldn't see and kept stumbling around, but she said: "I am willing to break my head in order for the young people to learn culture well!"

	The Story of the Rapeseed

	At the "Illiteracy Grievance Meeting" in Hongguang Cooperative, Shuimo Township, Xining City, three female members, Tan Fengqin, Kong Qimei, and Shi Xingde, recounted the following incident: This spring, when planting vegetables, they were worried about the three packets of seeds for Chinese cabbage, cabbage, and radishes. Although the paper packages had words on them, they couldn't recognize a single one. Old man Wang Youde gave them an idea, telling them to wait on the main road and ask people. Tan Fengqin put down production and waited by the roadside. After anxiously waiting for the time it took to smoke two or three pipes, she waited for a worker riding a bicycle before she could ask clearly. But when she returned to the vegetable field, she had completely forgotten everything. Alas! What to do? The three of them had to take a packet of seeds each and ask people again, and it wasn't until the sun was high in the sky that they understood. They only planted eighteen plots of the thirty plots planned for the day.

	Now, these three female members have become active in learning culture. Tan Fengqin and Kong Qimei have already shed their illiteracy, and the old woman Shi Xingde, who is over fifty years old, has also recognized five or six hundred characters. Tan Fengqin draws on the table with her chopsticks when eating. She carries a small blackboard with her and learns whenever she has time. She repairs irrigation ditches during the day and studies until midnight. When she dozes off while listening to lectures, she stands and listens. Kong Qimei is seven or eight months pregnant and is always early for night school. No matter how strong the wind or how heavy the rain, she never interrupts her studies. Old woman Shi Xingde always studies until midnight every night from the beginning of her studies until now. She is a good student in the "Old Liang Hao Class." Once, the teacher asked her to write the words "Go all out, aim high" on the blackboard. She wrote them unhurriedly, and explained to everyone: "It's just like this old woman of mine, who is almost sixty years old, is still trying hard to learn culture. This is called aiming high."

	After learning culture, new things have appeared in production and work. A production team leader was not active in his work, so Tan Fengqin wrote a big-character poster criticizing him. After studying the experience of high wheat yield in Gucheng County, Hubei, with the members, she promoted these experiences in the cooperative according to local conditions, and the planned wheat yield was increased again. Shi Xingde's son, production team leader Wang Guozu, said: "My mother is not simple now! She can now record work points for everyone, and she can also say and write the names and uses of many fertilizers and pesticides."

    青海农村扫盲新事
    本报记者　赵淮青　杨立本
    一天等于二十年
    湟中县丰胜农业社的青年社员樊祖魁，1954年进民校，四年中只学会二十多个字。他在最近半个月内却摘掉了文盲帽子。人们说：“总路线使人脑子开窍，一天能顶二十年。”
    樊祖魁小名五十六，是社里有名的“笨人”。最初民校组织他进扫盲突击班学习，他的父亲樊永元老汉不同意，说他儿子笨，学不会还耽误劳动。一些小伙子也说：“五十六能学好，我们不吃饭。”教员乔玉玺说服了他的父亲，批评了讽刺他的小伙子，对他说：“只要你肯学，你问千遍我教千遍。”
    当樊祖魁认会了第一批字时，教员便表扬他：“谁说你笨啊，你不是学得很好吗？”又说：“劳动人民无笨人，就怕学习不认真。”樊祖魁一旦认真学起来就像着了迷，有时忘记了吃饭，忘记了睡觉，有时为了记一个生字，蹩得满头大汗。他不懂就问，碰着谁就问谁。教员用了见物识字、同音字同义字排队、字体拆开合并等十几种办法教他，开始他一天能认三四十个字，后来一天能认到两百个字。
    樊祖魁在扫盲班毕业的那天晚上，民校开了一个会。会上，教员从课本上挑了几百个较难的字当众测验了樊祖魁，证明他会认、会念、会讲、会写，他还向大家谈了自己苦学的经过。到会的人个个都受到了教育。樊永元老汉也说：“过去我对儿子的看法不对头，我那本老皇历不灵了。”
    文化家庭
    在夜深人静的时候，是谁家的屋里还燃着通明的灯火？西宁水磨乡红光社的社员们说：“这是胡占鳌老汉家在学文化，他一家八口，除了老伴和三儿子双目失明外，他和两个儿子、三个媳妇在两个月里都摘掉了文盲帽子。
    人们说胡占鳌家是个文化家庭。胡占鳌老汉六十多岁了，还带头学文化。他给全家每人准备了一块磨平的石板和搅拌好的红土汁，让大家练字。三个儿媳妇谁也不愿意落在后头，大儿媳李俊英一天能认六十多个字，三儿媳吴兴梅说：“我一天认它八十个，一定赶过你。”她们劳动一天回来，晚上就你考我，我问你，一直学到深夜。
    双目失明的老婆婆为了让儿媳们腾出时间学文化，把一切家务事都担当起来，要是听到谁在拉着风箱念书，她就过去把风箱接过来。全家有三个还没有断奶的娃娃，晚上妈妈到夜校去了，孩子们的哭闹声此起彼落，老婆婆就从这屋摸到那屋，哄这个又抱那个。眼睛看不见，摸来摸去直跌跤，她说：“为了让年轻人学好文化，就是跌破头也情愿呵！”
    菜籽的故事
    在西宁市水磨乡红光社的“文盲诉苦会”上，三个女社员谭凤琴、孔其梅和施兴德诉说了这么一桩事：今年春天种菜时，她们拿着黄芽白、大白菜、水萝卜三包菜籽发了愁，纸包上虽然写着字，可她们都一字不识。老汉王有德给出了个主意，叫她们到大路上等人问，谭凤琴放下生产到路边，焦心地等了两三袋烟的工夫，等来了一个骑脚踏车的工人，才问清楚。可是当她回到菜田时，就忘了个一干二净，什么也说不上来。唉！怎么办呢？三个人只好一人拿着一个纸包再去问人，直到太阳老高才问明白，当天计划种的三十畦菜只种了十八畦。
    现在，这三个女社员都成了学习文化的积极分子。谭凤琴和孔其梅已经摘掉了文盲帽子，五十多岁的施兴德老妈妈也识了五六百字。谭凤琴吃饭时都用筷头在桌上画。她把小黑板带在身边，有空就学。白天修水渠，晚上还学到半夜。听讲时打瞌睡，她就站着听。孔其梅怀孕七、八个月了，上夜校每天数她早，不管风多大，雨多急，从不间断学习。施兴德老妈妈从开始学习到现在，每晚总要学到半夜才睡。她是“老梁颢班”的好学生。有一次，教员叫她在黑板上写“鼓足干劲，力争上游”几个字，他不慌不忙地写了，还当着大家解释道：“就好比我老婆子快六十岁了，还在使劲学文化，这就叫力争上游。”
    学了文化，生产、工作就出现了新样子。有个生产队长工作不积极，谭凤琴就写大字报批评他。她和社员们一起学习了湖北谷城县小麦丰产经验后，把这些经验因地制宜地在本社推广，小麦的计划产量又提高了。施兴德的儿子、生产队长王国祖说：“我妈现在可不简单哩！她已经能给大家记工分了，许多化肥、农药的名字和用处，也都能说能写了。”
