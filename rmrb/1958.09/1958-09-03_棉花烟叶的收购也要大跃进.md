　　Cotton and Tobacco Leaf Procurement Should Also Leap Forward
　　By a Commentator of this Newspaper
    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council recently issued an urgent directive on strengthening the procurement of cotton and tobacco leaves. The implementation of this directive is of great significance for doing a good job in this year's cotton and tobacco leaf procurement work.
    This year's cotton and tobacco leaves are growing particularly well. At present, farmers in various regions are continuing to strengthen field management in the later stages. As long as major natural disasters do not occur, an unprecedented bumper harvest will be achieved. Most regions will achieve the per-mu average production target of ginned cotton stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule this year, and high-yield cotton fields with more than 1,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu will also appear in various regions. It is estimated that the national cotton output will increase by 100% compared with last year, and the tobacco leaf output will quadruple. This will be another huge victory on the agricultural production front in our country after the bumper harvest of wheat and early rice. Due to the bumper harvest of grain, cotton and other crops, the Chinese people's long-cherished wish of "adequate food and clothing" will soon be realized.
    Cotton and tobacco leaves are both cash crops, and the commodity volume accounts for about 90% of the output. Under the circumstances of a bumper harvest of these crops, how to do a good job in procurement and meet the farmers' sales requirements has become a major task for the current financial and trade departments.
    To do a good job in this year's cotton and tobacco leaf procurement, in addition to continuing to implement the state's policy of unified purchase and unified procurement, it is also necessary to adopt the policy of quick procurement, more procurement, good procurement, and sufficient procurement.
    Why should the state adopt the policy of more procurement and sufficient procurement after a bumper harvest of cotton? Is it possible to increase the amount retained by farmers and reduce the amount of state unified purchase? As everyone knows: the amount of cotton retained by farmers as stipulated in the past has taken into account the needs of farmers in all aspects, and is generally reasonable, and can still be implemented as before this year; if there are too high or too low situations in a few areas, it is only a matter of individual adjustments; if more cotton is generally retained, it is likely to cause waste. It should be understood that if the amount of cotton retained by farmers increases, the amount of cotton sold by agricultural cooperatives will relatively decrease. This will not only affect the supply of raw materials for the textile industry, but also inevitably affect the income of agricultural cooperatives, which is detrimental to the development of industrial and agricultural production. The state can spin more yarn and weave more cloth by purchasing a little more cotton, which can accumulate more funds for national industrialization, accelerate the process of national industrialization and agricultural modernization, and meet the needs of the people for clothing. The state can also increase its reserves by purchasing a little more cotton. In recent years, the amount of cotton reserves in our country has been very small. This situation is not commensurate with our needs. Therefore, it is completely necessary to purchase more in bumper harvest years and purchase all commodity cotton to make up for deficiencies in lean years.
    Not only should we procure more and procure sufficiently, but we must also procure quickly. This is a need to adapt to the changes in objective circumstances after agricultural cooperativization. After agricultural cooperativization, the economic law of small-scale peasant economy selling for the sake of buying has also changed accordingly. In order to accelerate capital turnover and expand reproduction, agricultural production cooperatives need to sell their agricultural and sideline products early. In order to promote the development of agricultural production and meet the requirements of agricultural cooperatives to sell early, commercial departments should basically complete the annual procurement task of cotton and tobacco leaves before the end of the year. From the current situation, cotton and tobacco leaves are in a period of transition. In order to support the great leap forward in industrial production, we must seize the procurement as soon as these crops are on the market.
    "The correct leadership of the Party is the guarantee for the victory of all socialist construction undertakings." The Party committees at all levels in the cotton and tobacco producing areas must pay special attention to the procurement of cotton and tobacco leaves, and strengthen the leadership over this work, and list this work as one of the central tasks of the Party committees in the cotton and tobacco producing areas in this stage. At present, a comprehensive inspection should be carried out on the production of cotton and the preparations for procurement by commercial departments, and problems should be discovered and resolved in a timely manner. In the future, the procurement of cotton and tobacco leaves should also be regularly supervised and inspected.
    This year's cotton and tobacco leaf output is large, the procurement volume is large, and the time for agricultural cooperatives to sell to the state is very concentrated. Therefore, to do a good job in this year's cotton and tobacco leaf procurement, it is also necessary to fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and resolutely adopt the working method of the mass line. Last year, in the aspect of cotton procurement, great achievements were made in the procurement work due to relying on the masses in all links from picking and grading to procurement, and implementing the working methods of the mass line of "three searches," "four separations," "five separations," and "five evaluations." Last year, due to the implementation of "three searches" in cotton picking, the phenomenon of cotton loss and waste was greatly reduced or even eliminated, and the actual harvest of cotton was relatively increased. Many places have reported that the phenomenon of waste in cotton picking in the past was quite serious. Some places conducted key inspections and found that the fallen flowers, stiff petal cotton, and "eyelashes" scattered in the cotton fields averaged about two or three jin of ginned cotton per mu. Our country plants 80 to 90 million mu of cotton every year. If we calculate the loss of two jin of ginned cotton per mu, the country will lose 1 million dan of cotton every year. Last year, due to the mobilization of the masses to carry out the "three searches" movement of finding fallen flowers, finding stiff petal flowers, and finding "eyelashes," the waste in this aspect was basically eliminated, and the agricultural cooperatives increased a large amount of income, and the state also increased the amount of cotton procurement. Although the rural labor force is relatively tight this year, women, children, and the elderly and weak semi-labor force can still be mobilized to participate in the "three searches" of cotton, so as to increase the actual harvest of cotton this year and increase the state's cotton procurement volume.
    Relying on the masses to carry out "four separations" of cotton is to separate the pest-damaged cotton and stiff petal cotton from the good cotton when picking cotton according to the order of maturity of the first spray, the second spray, and the tail shoots, and separate them for drying, separate them for storage, and then sell them to the national cotton purchasing agency separately according to this classification. If the seed cotton is processed into ginned cotton by the agricultural cooperative, and is processed according to this classification, then add separate ginning, which is called "five separations." Last year, the grade of cotton generally improved by one grade compared with the previous year, the fiber length and ginning outturn of cotton increased, and the impurities were greatly reduced. In addition to the great relationship with the climate, the popularization of excellent varieties, and the improvement of field management of agricultural cooperatives, the relatively widespread implementation of cotton separation, drying, storage, sales, and ginning is also an important factor in improving the quality of cotton. Due to the general improvement in the grade and length of cotton, agricultural cooperatives have obtained more income, and the state has further implemented the superior cotton for superior use in cotton use, and the textile industry has also reduced the waste cotton rate in production due to the uniform grade of cotton. Therefore, this year we should vigorously promote the benefits of cotton "four separations" or "five separations" to the country and cotton farmers, and combine the actual benefits obtained by cotton farmers last year to mobilize agricultural cooperatives and cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas to comprehensively carry out the work of cotton "four separations" or "five separations."
    Last year, on the basis of cotton "four separations" or "five separations," "five evaluations" were also implemented. Supply and marketing cooperatives helped agricultural cooperatives train more than 100,000 technical personnel for cotton grading, and during the cotton procurement process, they often held symposiums attended by procurement personnel, agricultural cooperative representatives, agricultural cooperative technicians, and experienced old farmers. They jointly evaluated the moisture content, impurities, ginning outturn, and grade length of the cotton sold by agricultural cooperatives to the state based on the national grade standards, turning the grading work into a joint matter for agricultural cooperatives and purchasing stations, thus reducing or even eliminating deviations in the acceptance work and further strengthening the relationship between the state, agricultural cooperatives, and farmers. This year, commercial departments must also help agricultural cooperatives train more inspection technicians and further rely on the masses to do a good job in cotton grading and inspection.
    From the above series of mass line working methods from cotton picking to selling to the state, we can get such an enlightenment: Since cotton procurement can take the mass line, then the procurement of tobacco leaves and many other agricultural products is also entirely possible and entirely should take the working methods of the mass line. The problem now is that some comrades in the commercial departments only talk about the mass line in words, but in fact they still do not have enough understanding of the masses' awareness and the masses' strength, and do not have the confidence or determination to rely on the masses to do things well. Therefore, comrades in commercial departments must insert the red flag of the mass line, which is the key to making procurement work fast, plentiful, good, and sufficient.
    To do a good job in the procurement of cotton and tobacco leaves, in addition to relying on the broad masses of farmers, we must also rely on the broad masses of employees in the commercial system, vigorously carry out the technical innovation movement, and mobilize them to create boldly. All methods that have been proven effective in the reform of cotton and tobacco leaf processing tools and procurement methods should be widely promoted. Under the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the procurement of agricultural products should also have a new leap forward. Commercial workers across the country should do a good job in this year's cotton and tobacco leaf procurement with a great leap forward attitude.
    In terms of cotton and tobacco leaf processing, storage, and transportation, on the one hand, we must give full play to the strength of the commercial system itself, and on the other hand, we should also make full use of local forces and agricultural cooperative forces to jointly do a good job in this year's cotton processing, storage, and transportation.

　　棉花烟叶的收购也要大跃进
　　本报评论员
    中共中央和国务院最近发出了关于加强棉花、烟叶收购工作的紧急指示，贯彻执行这个指示，对于做好今年棉花、烟叶的收购工作具有十分重要的意义。
    今年的棉花、烟叶生长情况特别好，目前各地农民正在继续加强后期的田间管理，只要不发生大的自然灾害，将会获得空前的大丰收。大多数地区的棉花将提前在今年实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的皮棉每亩平均生产指标，各地还将出现千斤以上的皮棉丰产田。预计全国棉花产量将比去年增长一倍，烟叶产量将比去年翻两番。这将是我国农业生产战线上继小麦、早稻丰收以后的又一巨大胜利。由于粮食、棉花等农作物的大丰收，我国人民多年以来“丰衣足食”的愿望，不久就可以实现了。
    棉花、烟叶都是经济作物，商品量占产量的90％左右。在这些作物大丰收的情况下，如何做好收购工作，满足农民的出售要求，就成为当前财贸部门的一项重大任务。
    做好今年棉花、烟叶的收购工作，除了继续贯彻执行国家的统购和统一收购政策以外，还必须采取快收、多收、收好、收足的方针。
    为什么在棉花大丰收以后，国家还要采取多收、收足的方针呢？是否可以增加农民留用的数量，减少国家统购的数量呢？大家知道：各地过去规定的农民留用棉花的数量已经照顾了农民各方面的需要，一般地说是合理的，今年仍可照旧执行；少数地区如有偏高偏低的情况，那只是个别调整的问题；如果再一般地多留棉花，就很可能造成浪费。要知道，农民留用棉花数量多了，农业社出售棉花的数量就要相对地减少，这样，不仅会影响纺织工业原料的供应，而且也必然会影响农业社的收入，对工农业生产的发展都是不利的。而国家多收购一点棉花，就可以多纺纱、多织布，可以多为国家工业化积累资金，加速国家工业化和农业现代化的进程，可以满足人民群众对衣着的需要；国家多收购一点棉花，还可以增加国家的储备，几年来我国棉花的储备数量是很少的，这种情况同我们的需要比较起来是不相称的，因此，在丰收年景多购一点，把全部商品棉都收购起来，以丰补歉，也是完全必要的。
    不仅要多收，收足，而且要快收。这是适应农业合作化以后客观情况变化以后的需要的。农业合作化以后，过去小农经济为买而卖的经济规律也随之改变了。农业生产合作社为了加速资金周转和扩大再生产，就需要提早出售他们所生产的农副产品。为了促进农业生产的发展，满足农业社提前出售的要求，商业部门应该在年前基本上完成棉花、烟叶的全年收购任务。从当前情况来说，棉花、烟叶正处于青黄不接时期，为了支持工业生产大跃进，必须在这些作物一上市就抓紧收购。
    “党的正确领导是一切社会主义建设事业胜利的保证”。对于棉花和烟叶的收购工作，棉烟产区的各级党委必须予以特别的重视，并加强对这一工作的领导，把这项工作列为棉烟产区党委这一阶段的中心工作之一。目前就应当对棉花的生产情况和商业部门收购工作的准备情况，进行一次全面的检查，及时发现问题，予以解决。今后对于棉花和烟叶的收购工作，也还要经常进行督促和检查。
    今年棉花、烟叶产量大，收购量多，而且农业社向国家交售的时间又很集中，因此，做好今年棉花、烟叶的收购工作，还必须充分发动群众、依靠群众，坚决采取群众路线的工作方法。去年在棉花收购方面，由于从采摘、分级到收购的各个环节上依靠群众，实行了“三找”“四分”“五分”和“五评”的群众路线的工作方法，在收购工作上取得很大成绩。去年由于在棉花采摘上实行了“三找”，大大减少了以至杜绝了棉花散失和浪费的现象，相对地增加了棉花的实际收获量。不少地方反映，过去在采摘棉花中浪费现象是相当严重的，有些地方进行重点检查，发现散失在棉田里的落地花、僵瓣棉和“眼睫毛”等每亩平均约合二、三斤皮棉。我国每年种植棉花八、九千万亩，如果每亩以浪费二斤皮棉来推算，全国每年就要损失一百几十万担棉花。去年由于发动群众开展了找落地花、找僵瓣花、找“眼睫毛”的所谓“三找”运动，基本上消灭了这方面的浪费现象，农业社增加了一笔很大的收入，国家也增加了棉花的收购量。今年农村劳动力虽然比较紧张，但是仍然可以发动妇女、小孩和老弱半劳动力等参加棉花“三找”的工作，以便更多的增加今年棉花的实际收获量和增加国家的棉花收购量。
    依靠群众进行棉花“四分”，就是在采摘棉花的时候，根据棉花的头喷、二喷和尾梢的成熟次序，把虫害棉、僵瓣棉同好棉分开采摘，分开曝晒，分开保存，然后按照这种分类分开向国家棉花采购机构交售。如果籽棉是由农业社加工皮棉，并且是按照这种分类加工的，那就再加上分轧，即称为“五分”。去年棉花品级一般比上个年度提高一个等级，棉花纤维长度和衣分率增加，杂质大大减少的原因，除了同气候、优良品种的普遍推广和农业社田间管理的改进有很大关系外，比较普遍地推行了棉花分摘、分晒、分存、分售和分轧也是提高棉花质量的重要因素。由于棉花的品级和长度普遍提高，农业社得到了较多的收入，国家在用棉方面也进一步实行了优棉优用，纺织工业也因为棉花品级整齐而减少了生产中的废棉率。因此今年还应大力宣传实行棉花“四分”或“五分”对国家对棉农的好处，并结合去年棉农得到的实际利益，动员产棉区的农业社和棉农全面地进行棉花“四分”或“五分”的工作。
    去年在棉花“四分”或“五分”的基础上还实行了“五评”，供销社帮助农业社训练了十几万个棉花分级的技术人员，并在棉花收购过程中，经常举行有采购人员、农业社代表、农业社的技术人员和有经验的老农民参加的座谈会，他们把农业社向国家交售的棉花，根据国家规定的等级标准共同评议棉花的水分、杂质、衣分率和品级长度，把评级工作变成农业社和采购站共同的事情，因而减少了以至消灭了验收工作中的偏差，进一步密切了国家同农业社和农民的关系。今年商业部门还必须帮助农业社训练更多的检验技术人员，进一步依靠群众作好棉花的分级检验工作。
    从上述棉花由采摘到向国家交售过程中一系列的群众路线的工作方法看，我们可以得到这样一个启示：既然棉花收购可以走群众路线，那么烟叶以及其他许多农产品的收购工作，也就完全可能和完全应该采取群众路线的工作方法。现在的问题是在商业部门中还有些同志只是在口头上谈谈群众路线，实际上对群众的觉悟程度和群众的力量还认识不足，没有信心或决心依靠群众把事情办好。因此，商业部门的同志必须插上群众路线的红旗，这是收购工作作到快多好足的关键。
    做好棉花和烟叶的收购工作，除了必须依靠广大农民群众以外，还必须依靠商业系统的广大职工群众，大力开展技术革新运动，发动他们大胆创造。凡是在棉花、烟叶加工工具改革以及收购方法方面已经行之有效的办法，都要普遍推广。在工农业生产大跃进的新形势下，农产品采购工作也应有一个新的跃进。全国商业工作人员应以大跃进的姿态做好今年棉花、烟叶的收购工作。
    在棉花、烟叶的加工、保管和运输方面，一方面要充分运用商业系统本身的力量，另一方面还应充分利用地方力量和农业社力量，共同做好今年棉花的加工、保管和运输工作。
