Infinite Vitality
A summary by our reporter: The achievements of work-study programs in Jiangsu over the past six months.
The tremendous achievements of the work-study program in Jiangsu Province over the past six months fully demonstrate the great revolutionary significance and infinite vitality of the Party's socialist education policy. Starting in March this year, work-study programs sprouted throughout all secondary and higher education institutions in the province. As of now, students from 1,366 secondary and higher education institutions across the province have engaged in work-study activities, contributing 24,810,000 workdays, with an average of 32 workdays per student. All of the province's 6,500+ agricultural middle schools and vocational schools have implemented a half-work, half-study system, with students cultivating over 20,000 mu of high-yield experimental plots in addition to engaging in production at home, and running over 10,000 small factories of various kinds. The content of work-study programs has also become richer in practice, evolving from sporadic participation in voluntary labor to the establishment of regular, standardized labor systems; from voluntary labor inside and outside schools to engaging in self-organized industrial and agricultural production; from small-scale experimental trials to large-scale factory operations. This unprecedentedly large-scale and content-rich work-study movement has quickly plunged hundreds of thousands of intellectuals, previously buried in books, into the great melting pot of productive labor. In these six months, it has cultivated 750,000 reserve labor troops with socialist consciousness and culture for the country.

The greatest characteristics of Jiangsu Province's work-study program are its close integration with production, rapid implementation, and widespread coverage. As early as February this year, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized leadership in this work. From the very beginning, it adopted a method of combining airing of views, debates, and actions, mobilizing all secondary and higher education institutions to launch a work-study competition centered on supporting industrial and agricultural production during the winter vacation. Nanjing University organized teachers and students from various departments to go to factories, farms, mountainous areas, and the countryside, according to their specialties and the needs of industrial and agricultural production, to participate in productive labor. The East China Institute of Water Conservancy mobilized more than 1,400 teachers and students to participate in farmland water conservancy construction in Jiangsu Province and Hefei, Guangzhou, and other places. Because the work-study activities of major universities and middle schools were closely integrated with production, this greatly supported industrial and agricultural production, and also enriched the content of work-study activities, further developing the movement.

In the past six months, 750,000 college and middle school students in Jiangsu have been simultaneously studying, researching, and participating in productive labor, gradually changing the past educational methods that were divorced from reality and production, thus greatly improving the quality of education. In the past, students, although they had read many books, could neither work in factories nor farm the land; they were people who neither moved their limbs nor distinguished the five grains. Nanjing No. 1 Middle School recently assessed the students' knowledge levels and found that students who participated in the work-study circuit installation group could all understand and draw circuit diagrams of actual main bodies, install circuits, inspect and repair faults in circuits, repair fuses, and use electrical tools. Most significantly, since the implementation of work-study programs, teachers and students from various schools have jointly trial-produced a large number of new products, 188 of which were not previously produced in the country, and some have reached international standards. The facts eloquently demonstrate that firmly implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, linking theory with practice, and vigorously developing work-study activities are the fundamental reasons for improving teaching quality.

After the work-study program entered the new stage of large-scale factory construction, the work-study activities of various schools formed a new upsurge. Under the principle of prioritizing indigenous methods over foreign ones, and starting small before going big, schools actively raised funds, found equipment, built their own blast furnaces, and found their own factory buildings. In less than a week, many factories and indigenous blast furnaces sprung up everywhere. Currently, schools across the province have established 12,343 factories, including more than 2,000 indigenous blast furnaces that have successively been ignited and produced iron, and are expected to produce 30,000 tons of steel this year. Nanjing Aeronautical Institute has established 27 factories in various departments and teaching and research sections, capable of manufacturing precision machinery, aviation materials, instruments, motors, generators, and other equipment. The entire school is currently collaborating to manufacture an airplane, which is intended to be a gift for the National Work-Study Exhibition. Secondary schools and agricultural middle schools in various special districts and counties across the province have also established a large number of factories within a few days. Changshu County's 21 secondary schools have established an average of ten factories each. Schools running their own factories not only directly supports industrial and agricultural production, but also provides rich production experience, enriches the content of the curriculum, and provides the most practical topics for scientific research when encountering major and difficult problems in production. Nanjing Agricultural College regards all of the college's farms, pastures, and factories as bases for comprehensive scientific experiments, thus skillfully combining teaching, production, and scientific research, enabling them to promote and facilitate each other, driving a great leap forward in the school's teaching work.

Among students in Jiangsu Province, there are three vivid comments circulating: "Refined steel and refined people," "Suntanned skin and reddened hearts," and "Calluses on hands, redness in hearts." After only a few months of work-study activities, the students' spiritual outlook has been completely renewed. Before the implementation of work-study programs, many students were detached from political struggle and productive labor, indulging in the petty circles of bourgeois individualism, their thoughts and feelings were empty. Now, what has taken its place is a healthy atmosphere full of youthful vitality. Students compare products with workers and enthusiasm with farmers. In the factories they run themselves, they also learn from workers and engage in competitions. The Chemical Engineering Department of Nanjing Institute of Technology conducts production completely according to the organization and discipline of a factory, which allows students to personally experience the joy of collective labor and cultivates collectivist thought.

Currently, in major universities and middle schools in Jiangsu, labor classes have become an indispensable and important part of the education plan. Universities and middle schools have actively mobilized teachers and students to discuss the great revolution in teaching work. People can foresee that after such a thorough teaching reform is carried out on the basis of the great achievements of work-study programs, Jiangsu's education will definitely usher in an unprecedentedly prosperous new situation.

    无限的生命力
    本报记者综述：江苏半年勤工俭学的成就
    江苏省半年来勤工俭学的巨大成就，充分显示出党的社会主义教育方针的伟大革命意义和无限生命力。今年3月开始，勤工俭学即在全省中等以上学校遍地生芽。到目前为止，全省一千三百六十六所中等以上学校的学生都投入了勤工俭学活动，已经作了二千四百八十一万个劳动日，每个学生平均做了三十二个劳动日；全省六千五百多所农业中学和职业中学，也一律实行了半耕半读制度，学生除回家生产外，并种了二万多亩高额试验田，办了各种小型工厂一万多个。勤工俭学的内容也在实践中更加丰富，从最初零星的参加义务劳动，到建立经常的正规的劳动制度；从校内外的义务劳动，到自搞工农业生产；从小型实验性的试验，进入到大办工厂。这一规模空前内容丰富的勤工俭学运动，使成千上万的埋头于书本的知识分子，很快投进生产劳动的大熔炉。在这半年时间中，为国家培养着七十五万有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动后备大军。
    江苏省勤工俭学的最大特点是紧密结合生产、推得快、铺得广。早在今年2月间，中共江苏省委就重视了这一工作的领导。一开始就采取边鸣放、边辩论、边行动的方法，发动各中等以上学校利用寒假时间，展开了一个以支援工农业生产为中心的勤工俭学竞赛。南京大学组织了各系教师同学，根据专业性质和工农业生产的需要，分赴各工厂、农场、山区和野外，参加生产劳动。华东水利学院出动了一千四百多师生参加了江苏省和合肥、广州等地的农田水利建设。由于各大中学校的勤工俭学活动紧密结合了生产，这就大大支援了工农业生产，而且也使勤工俭学活动的内容更加丰富多采，使运动得到进一步的发展。
    半年来江苏七十五万大中学生一面读书，一面研究，一面参加生产劳动，逐渐改变了过去脱离实际脱离生产的教育方法，因而教育质量大大提高。过去的学生虽然读了不少书，但既不会做工，也不会种田，是一个四体不勤、五谷不分的人。南京市一中最近考核了学生的知识水平，凡参加勤工俭学电路安装小组的同学，都能看懂能绘电路实际主体图，能安装电路，能检查修缮电路中所发生的故障，能检修保险丝，能使用电器工具。最明显的是，勤工俭学以来，各校师生合作试制了大批新产品，其中有一百八十八种是国内没有生产过的，有些已经达到国际水平。事实雄辩地说明，坚决地贯彻教育结合生产劳动的方针，使理论联系实际，大力开展勤工俭学活动，是提高教学质量的根本原因。
    勤工俭学进入大办工厂的新阶段以后，各校的勤工俭学活动又形成一个新的高潮。各校在先土后洋，先小后大的方针下，纷纷自筹资金，自找设备，自建高炉，自找厂房，不到一个星期，许多工厂和土高炉就遍地开花。现在全省各校已办起一万二千三百四十三个工厂，其中二千多座土高炉已经陆续升火出铁，今年就可产钢铁三万吨。南京航空学院各系各教研室已经建立二十七个工厂，能制造精密机械、航空材料、仪表、电机、发电机等各种设备，最近全校正在协作制造一架飞机，准备作为全国勤工俭学展览会的献礼。全省各专区各县的中等学校、农业中学也在几天之内办起了大批工厂。常熟县二十一所中等学校，平均每校办十个厂。学校自办工厂，不仅直接支援了工农业生产，而且，提供了丰富的生产经验，充实了课程的内容，同时生产中遇到重大的疑难问题，又为科学研究提供了最有实际意义的题目。南京农学院把全院所有的农场、牧场和工厂等生产单位，都做为综合科学试验的基地，这样，就把教学、生产和科学研究巧妙地结合在一起，因而就能互相推动，互相促进，带动全校的教学工作的大跃进。
    在江苏省学生中流传着这么三句生动的评语：“炼了钢铁炼了人”，“晒黑了皮肤晒红了心”，“茧在手上，红在心上”。开展勤工俭学活动仅仅几个月，学生的精神面貌就焕然一新。勤工俭学以前，许多学生脱离政治斗争，脱离生产劳动，沉缅于资产阶级个人主义的小圈子里，思想感情空虚。现在，代之而起的是一片健康的、充满青春活力的风气。学生们和工人比产品，和农民比干劲。在他们自己办的工厂里，也学着工人一样搞竞赛。南京工学院化工系完全按工厂的一套组织和纪律进行生产，这就使同学们亲身感受到集体劳动的欢愉，培养了集体主义的思想。
    目前，在江苏各大中学校里，劳动课已成为教育计划中不可缺少的重要组成部分。各高等学校和中等学校都已经积极地发动全校师生讨论教学工作的大革命。人们可以预见，在勤工俭学获得巨大成就的基础上，进行这样彻底的教学改革之后，江苏的教育事业定会出现一个史无前例的空前兴旺的新局面。
