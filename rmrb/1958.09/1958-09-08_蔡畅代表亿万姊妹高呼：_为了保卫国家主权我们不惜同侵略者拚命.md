　　Cai Chang, representing hundreds of millions of sisters, shouted:
　　We will fight the invaders to the death to defend national sovereignty
    We, the women of the whole country, resolutely support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on September 6 regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait. This statement fully expresses the determination of the Chinese people, regardless of gender, to resolutely oppose the military provocations and war threats of U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait region, and expresses the unwavering will of the Chinese people to liberate their own territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. Defending sovereignty and territorial integrity is the sacred responsibility and right of all the people of the country.
    Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times, and the coastal islands such as Jinmen and Matsu are even more islands belonging to China's inland sea. Liberating these islands is the responsibility of the Chinese people themselves, and it is entirely our country's internal affair. How can we allow U.S. imperialism to interfere? But just as the Chinese people, regardless of gender, are leaping forward on the road of socialist peaceful construction with selfless labor, the American aggressors are openly deploying troops and generals in the Taiwan region. Dulles openly declared that he would expand American aggression in the Taiwan region, brazenly destroying all international laws, and wanting to impose war on us, threatening peace in the Far East and the world. This bandit behavior of U.S. imperialism has aroused unparalleled anger among the Chinese people.
    We warn U.S. imperialism that the Chinese people love peace, but we will never allow aggressors to run rampant. If U.S. imperialism dares to continue military provocations and dares to expand aggression, the Chinese people will never hesitate to shed their blood to protect their sovereignty and territorial integrity. Chinese women, in order to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, to defend the fruits of socialist construction, and to defend the happiness of our children, will not hesitate to fight the American aggressors to the death. The Chinese people cannot be intimidated.
    People's China is the China of the Chinese people, and all the just and peace-loving countries and people in the world stand with us. The military provocations and aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism are bound to be thoroughly defeated under the joint opposition of the Chinese people and the people of the world.
    The entire Chinese people must mobilize and fight to the end to smash any provocation by the American aggressors!
    We must liberate Jinmen and Matsu! We must liberate Taiwan!

　　蔡畅代表亿万姊妹高呼：
　　为了保卫国家主权  我们不惜同侵略者拚命
    我们全国妇女坚决拥护周恩来总理9月6日发表的“关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明”。这个声明充分表达了我国人民不分男女，坚决反对美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅和战争威胁的决心，表达了我国人民解放自己的领土台湾和澎湖列岛的不可动摇的意志。保卫主权和领土的完整是全国人民的神圣责任和权利。
    台湾和澎湖列岛，自古以来就是中国的领土，金门马祖等沿海岛屿更是属于中国内海的岛屿。解放这些岛屿，这是中国人民自己的责任，这完全属于我国的内政，岂能容美国帝国主义的干涉？但是正当中国人民，不分男女，以忘我劳动，在社会主义的和平建设大道上大跃进的时候，美国侵略者却公然在台湾地区，调兵遣将，杜勒斯公然宣言要扩大美国在台湾地区的侵略，悍然破坏一切国际法的规则，要想把战争强加在我们头上，威胁远东和世界的和平。美帝国主义的这种强盗行为，激起了全中国人民无比的愤怒。
    我们警告美帝国主义，中国人民是热爱和平的，但是我们决不允许侵略者横行霸道，如果美帝国主义敢于继续进行军事挑衅，敢于扩大侵略，中国人民为了保护主权和领土的完整，是决不会吝惜自己的鲜血的，中国妇女为保卫国家的主权和领土的完整，为保卫社会主义建设的劳动果实，为保卫我们的孩子们的幸福，是不惜同美国侵略者拚命的。中国人民是吓不倒的。
    人民中国是中国人民的中国，全世界正义的、爱好和平的国家和人民同我们是站在一块的，美帝国主义的军事挑衅和侵略阴谋，必然要在中国人民和全世界人民共同反对之下，遭到彻底的失败。
    全中国人民动员起来，为粉碎美国侵略者的任何挑衅而斗争到底！
    我们一定要解放金门马祖！我们一定要解放台湾！
