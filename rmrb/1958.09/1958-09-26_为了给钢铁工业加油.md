    To Fuel the Steel Industry
    In order to implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, and to fuel the steel industry, the fourth and fifth year students of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology unanimously requested to work outside the school for six months. The school's Party committee, in accordance with the instructions of higher authorities and the students' requests, has now organized a work team of over 1,500 people, composed of fourth and fifth year students majoring in metallurgy, technology, machinery, and mining, and dispatched them to various parts of the country, from northern Inner Mongolia to southern Guangdong, to support steel production. With the exception of a small number of students who are directly assigned to work posts, the majority of the students have recently departed. The students unanimously believe that going to various places to support steel production is a glorious political task, and they all guarantee to fulfill it. (Bing Ren)

    为了给钢铁工业加油
    北京钢铁学院四、五年级的同学，为了贯彻教育同生产劳动结合的方针，为了给钢铁工业加油，一致要求出外工作半年。校党委根据上级的指示和同学的要求，现已组织了由冶金、工艺、机械、采矿等专业四、五年级的学生组成的一千五百余人的工作队，派到北自内蒙古、南至广东的全国各地支援钢铁生产。除少部分同学走向工作岗位外，大部分同学都在最近出发。同学们一致认为到各地去支援钢铁生产是一项光荣的政治任务，大家都保证一定完成。  （冰人）
