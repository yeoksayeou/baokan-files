Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 28th: The Italian newspaper "Unità" published on the 16th the resolution passed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain: "The Communist Party of Spain's Struggle to End the Franco Dictatorship."

The meeting was held on September 13th and 14th. The meeting heard and unanimously adopted two reports from the Political Bureau of the Central Committee made by Comrade Ibarruri and Comrade Carrillo. These two reports discussed the current situation at home and abroad and the tasks of the Party in the struggle against the fascist regime. The meeting also approved the work led by the Political Bureau since the last plenary session of the Central Committee (in September last year).

The resolution said: "The results of the National Reconciliation Day prominently demonstrate the correctness of the Party's policy and the development of the anti-Franco movement among the masses. The Central Committee calls on all organizations and all members of the Party to redouble their efforts to strengthen and unite this movement, giving it increasingly strengthened organization. The anti-Franco movement program includes the most urgent demands of all social strata in Spain: the struggle against hunger and against the economic policies of the dictatorship, the struggle for amnesty for political prisoners and political exiles, and the struggle to safeguard all kinds of social freedoms."

The resolution pointed out: "The preparations for and the course of the National Reconciliation Day showed the progress our Party has made." "The Central Committee instructs all organizations and all members of the Party to redouble their efforts to create the most appropriate organizational forms to establish unity with workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the national bourgeoisie, so that the various actions of the masses' struggle can converge into a torrent, and so that it is possible to reach agreement and consultation with all political organizations opposing the current regime, even on limited issues. The unified action of this tide can form a huge force that the dictatorship cannot resist."

The resolution strongly condemned the United States' aggression against the Middle East and China and Franco's practice of providing bases for the United States. It said: "Disregarding the serious failure of imperialist aggression plots in the Middle East, and disregarding the condemnation of these plots at the special session of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States still insists on threatening world peace, as evidenced by the provocative actions against the People's Republic of China. Spain faces the grave danger of being dragged into the United States' adventurous policies. The Spanish bases handed over by Franco to the North American imperialists have long been used to invade the people of the Middle East and may also be used against the people of other countries. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain reminds all its organizations and all its members of the serious problems that these events may bring to Spain, and the Central Committee calls on organizations at all levels and all members of the Party to mobilize the Spanish people in order to defend peace, fight for the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, and oppose the use of our territory by American imperialists."

The resolution also analyzed the ideological issues of our era of transition from capitalism to socialism on a world scale. The resolution emphasized: "It is necessary to continue to strengthen the struggle against dogmatism and against revisionism. After the publication of the Moscow Declaration of the twelve parties of socialist countries, the Central Committee reiterated that world peace, the safeguarding of the independence of all peoples, and the victory of socialism depend on the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement, and that this unity must be based on Marxism-Leninism and around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Under this premise, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain believes that the revisionist ideas in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia should be criticized and are harmful, because the ideas in this program, in several key issues, are tainted with the ideology of imperialism."

### 把群众斗争汇成巨流  冲毁佛朗哥独裁政权  西共中央通过加强斗争决议

    把群众斗争汇成巨流
    冲毁佛朗哥独裁政权
    西共中央通过加强斗争决议
    新华社28日讯  罗马消息：意大利“团结报”16日刊载了西班牙共产党中央委员会第四次会议通过的决议：“西班牙共产党结束佛朗哥独裁统治的斗争”。
    这次会议是在9月13日和14日举行的。会议听取并且一致通过了由伊巴露丽同志和卡里略同志作的中央委员会政治局的两个报告。这两个报告谈到国内外当前的局势以及党在反对法西斯制度的斗争中的任务。会议也同意政治局自从（去年9月）上一次中央委员会全体会议以来所领导的工作。
    决议说：“全国和解日的结果突出地表明了党所奉行的政策的正确，而且表明了反佛朗哥运动在群众中的发展。中央委员会号召党的一切组织和全体党员加倍努力以便加强和统一这一运动，使它具有日益加强的组织性。反佛朗哥运动纲领中包括西班牙各社会阶层的最迫切的要求：反对饥饿和反对独裁制度的经济政策的斗争，争取赦免政治犯和政治流亡者、争取维护各种社会自由的斗争。
    决议指出：“全国和解日的准备工作和经过，显示出我们党所获得的进展。”“中央委员会责成一切组织和全体党员加倍努力以便创立同工人、农民、知识分子、民族资产阶级建立团结的最适当的各种组织形式，以便使群众斗争的种种行动汇合成一支巨流，以便争取甚至在有限度的问题上，能够同一切反对现政权的政治组织达成一致意见和进行协商。这一潮流的统一行动能够形成独裁制度所无法抵抗的巨大力量。”
    决议强烈谴责美国对中东和中国的侵略以及佛朗哥为美国提供基地的作法。它说：“美国不顾帝国主义侵略图谋在中东所遭到的严重失败、不顾这些图谋在联合国大会特别会议上所受到的谴责，仍然执意威胁世界和平，对中华人民共和国进行的挑衅行为证明了这一点。西班牙面临被卷入美国冒险政策的严重危险。佛朗哥交给北美帝国主义者的西班牙基地早已被用来侵略中东各国人民，而且还可能被用来反对其他国家的人民。西班牙共产党中央委员会提醒自己的一切组织和全体党员注意这些事件可能使西班牙面临的严重问题，中央委员会号召各级组织和全体党员把西班牙人动员起来，以便维护和平、争取禁止使用核武器并反对美帝国主义者利用我们的国土。”
    决议还分析了我们所处的资本主义在世界规模上过渡到社会主义的时代的意识形态问题。决议强调：“必须继续加强反对教条主义和反对修正主义的斗争。在社会主义国家十二个党莫斯科宣言发表以后，中央委员会曾重申：世界和平、各国人民的独立的维护和社会主义者的胜利，都取决于社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，而这一团结必须是建立在马克思列宁主义基础上并围绕着苏联共产党。在这种前提下，西班牙共产党中央委员会认为南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领的修正主义思想，是应该批判的，是有害的，因为这个纲领的思想，在好几个关键性问题上，是染上了帝国主义意识形态色彩的。”
