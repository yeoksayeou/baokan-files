Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 5th: As of September 1st, 107 counties and cities in Hebei Province have realized the people's commune system, establishing 716 large-scale comprehensive people's communes. The broad masses in other areas are also actively preparing to establish people's communes.

According to surveys and statistics, the scale of the communes is generally around 10,000 households in plains areas, around 5,000 households in hilly areas, and around 3,000 households in mountainous areas. In the great movement to establish people's communes, the masses are in extraordinarily high spirits. In particular, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are the most active and firm, vying to sign up and connecting with each other. The majority of upper-middle peasants have expressed support and approval for establishing people's communes, and a small number initially showed wavering, but after airing views, debates, and discussions, they gradually recognized the benefits of establishing people's communes. In the process of establishing communes, the broad masses wrote tens of thousands of big-character posters and pledges, and wrote tens of thousands of poems to praise the people's communes.

The great leap forward in agricultural production has driven a comprehensive leap forward in industry, commerce, education, military affairs, and various socialist construction undertakings in rural areas. As of mid-August, over 1.3 million various types of factories have been established in rural areas throughout the province. At the same time, middle schools, primary schools and universities are being established on a large scale, and the militia is being further strengthened. In addition, as of August 22nd, over 195,000 rural collective canteens, over 240,000 rural nurseries and kindergartens, and over 9,000 homes for the elderly have been established throughout the province. These new changes require agricultural cooperatives to move forward and transform into large-scale comprehensive people's communes.

In the movement to establish people's communes, Party committees at all levels have resolutely stood at the forefront of the movement, actively leading this movement. All issues related to the establishment of people's communes are generally addressed by mobilizing the masses to air their views and hold debates. According to incomplete statistics from the "Satellite," "Rocket," and "Gaimei" people's communes in Xingtai County, in mobilizing the masses to air their views and hold debates, the masses put forward over 30,700 suggestions related to the establishment of people's communes in just a few days. The vast majority of these suggestions are correct and have played a significant role in running the people's communes well.

In the movement to establish people's communes, all localities have paid attention to closely integrating with current production. In particular, after the establishment of people's communes, the unparalleled superiority of centralized allocation of labor and unified planning of production has been brought into play, greatly advancing current production. Before the establishment of people's communes in Xingtai County, agricultural cooperatives throughout the county had only built three small earthen furnaces and produced only 20 jin of iron. After the universal establishment of people's communes on August 25th, with more people and greater strength, 120 earthen furnaces and three small blast furnaces were built throughout the county in just four days. The role of the people's communes in agricultural production is even more evident. From August 15th to the end of August, the total amount of accumulated fertilizer throughout the province increased dramatically to 451.4 billion jin. Many places have launched the "enter the commune without carrying a white flag" movement, resolutely eliminating the three types of seedlings, so that various crops can be rapidly upgraded.

    愈辩心愈明　越走路越宽
　　河北万民争入大公社
    一百零七县市办起公社七百多个
    据新华社天津5日电　到9月1日止，河北省已有一百零七个县、市实现了人民公社化，办起大型的综合性的人民公社七百一十六个。其他地区的广大群众，也正在积极酝酿建立人民公社。
    据调查统计，公社的规模，平原地区一般是一万户左右，丘陵地区一般是五千户左右，山区一般是三千户左右。在建立人民公社的伟大运动中，群众情绪异常昂扬。其中特别是广大贫农和下中农，他们最积极、最坚定，争先报名，相互串联；上中农中的多数人对建立人民公社表示拥护赞成，少数人开始表现动摇，但经过鸣放辩论以后，也逐步认识到建立人民公社的好处。在办公社过程中，广大群众写了成千上万的大字报和决心书，并写出成千上万的诗歌来歌颂人民公社。
    农业生产的大跃进，带动了农村中工、商、学、兵和各项社会主义建设事业的全面大跃进。截至8月中旬，全省农村已办起各种工厂一百三十多万座。同时还大办中、小学校和大学，并进一步加强了民兵武装。另外，截至8月22日，全省已办起十九万五千多个农村集体食堂，二十四万多个农村托儿所、幼儿园，九千多个老年幸福院。这些新的变化，要求农业社前进一步，转为大型的综合性的人民公社。
    在建立人民公社运动中，各级党委都坚决地站在运动的前面，积极领导这个运动。有关建立人民公社当中的一切问题，一般都发动群众鸣放辩论。据邢台县卫星、火箭、盖美等三个人民公社不完全统计，在发动群众鸣放辩论中，短短几天群众就提出三万零七百多条有关建立人民公社的建议。其中绝大多数都是正确的，对办好人民公社起了很大作用。
    各地在建立人民公社运动中，都注意了紧密结合当前生产。特别是建立人民公社后，发挥了集中调配劳力、统一规划生产的无比优越性，使当前生产大大向前推进了一步。邢台县在办人民公社以前，全县农业社只建成了三个小土炉，只生产了二十斤铁。8月25日普遍建成人民公社后，人多力量大，只四天时间，全县即建起土炉一百二十座和土高炉三座。人民公社在农业生产方面的作用更加明显。从8月15日到8月底，全省积肥总量跃增到四万五千一百四十亿斤。许多地方都开展“不带白旗”入公社运动，坚决消灭掉三类苗，使各种作物迅速升级。
