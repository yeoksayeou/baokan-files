Pursuing "Conditionism"
Méi Èr

According to a report in the Shaanxi Daily on September 21st, many people in Pucheng County attribute the low or reduced wheat yield to poor regional conditions. Some even concluded that high yields cannot be achieved for wheat locally; or that high yields are only possible on small areas, not large areas; this is yet another variation of the "conditionism" argument.

"Conditionism" will appear at any time. Wherever there is a revolutionary mass movement, there are always some people who walk in the forefront, others in the middle, and still others who lag behind. Among those in the middle and the latter groups, "conditionists" will emerge. Among those who are content to be in the middle ranks or willingly remain behind, there will be such arguments: Don't look at them walking in the forefront; if their conditions were the same as mine, they would be far behind me. This is the excuse of the "conditionists."

Different conditions naturally produce different results. A wheat yield of over 8,000 jin per mu and a wheat yield of 200 jin per mu are always due to different conditions. However, where do these different conditions come from, and how should we deal with them? These are questions worth studying. Some conditions exist objectively, and some are created by people. Some are masters of conditions, and some are slaves to conditions. Being the master means controlling the conditions, turning unfavorable conditions into favorable ones, and creating all kinds of good conditions for oneself. Chairman Mao said that poverty and blankness appear to be bad things, but they are actually good things. Poverty breeds the desire for change, the desire to work, the desire to make revolution. A blank sheet of paper has no burden and is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, good for painting the newest and most beautiful pictures. What was originally regarded as a bad thing is now seen as a good thing. Isn't this turning unfavorable conditions into favorable ones? Being a slave to conditions will turn even favorable conditions into unfavorable ones. This year, the experience of wheat bumper harvests across the country is very rich. As long as we earnestly learn from these experiences, the wheat in our own regions can also achieve a bumper harvest. This is a good condition. However, some people are pessimistic and disappointed in the face of the national wheat bumper harvest, and are willing to lag behind.

From this, we can see that among many conditions, one condition plays a decisive role: that is, the human mind, the subjective initiative of people. Humbly admitting backwardness but not being willing to remain backward is an excellent condition; not humbly admitting backwardness but being willing to remain backward is a bad condition. With the latter condition, nothing will succeed, and everything will lag behind others. Without changing this condition, one will remain backward forever.

Since "conditionism" will not disappear, we must fight it to the end. This is also a unity of opposites: where there is "conditionism," there is anti-"conditionism." "Conditionism" is very fond of comparing. To defeat "conditionism," we must also use the method of comparison, which is called "using the enemy's spear to attack the enemy's shield." When Pucheng County fought against "conditionism," it compared itself with Chengcheng County. Chengcheng County produced sixteen wheat "satellites" with yields of 1,000 to 1,500 jin this year, while the conditions are the same as those in Pucheng County. This immediately refuted the "low wheat yield theory of the Weibei Plateau" and the "insufficient conditions theory."

Now is the time for planting wheat in various places. Many people want to create more and larger wheat "satellites" and large-area bumper harvests next year. This is certainly good and worth learning. However, there are also a few people who dare not propose creating more and larger "satellites" and proposing larger area bumper harvest targets, and even do not want to maintain the original targets. This is again "conditionism" at work. Therefore, refuting "conditionism" has become the key issue in striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of wheat next year.

    追击“条件论”
    梅二
    据9月21日陕西日报报道，蒲城县不少人把小麦产量不高或减产的原因，归罪于地区条件不好。有的人还得出结论说，当地小麦就不能获得高产；或者说，只能小面积高产，不能大面积高产；这是“条件论”的又一种论调。
    “条件论”在任何时候都会出现。在有革命的群众运动的地方，总是有一些人走在最前头，另一些人走在中间，再一些人落在后边。在中间和最后的两种人中，就会出现“条件论”者。安于中游或甘居下游的人中，就会有这样的论调：你不要看他们走在最前头，如果他们的条件同我一样，就会远远落在我的后边。这就是“条件论”者的遁词。
    不同的条件，自然会产生不同的结果。一个小麦亩产八千多斤，一个小麦亩产二百斤，总是因为具有不同的条件。但是，这种不同条件从何而来，又如何去对待，却是值得研究的问题。条件，有客观就存在的，也有人创造出来的。有的是做条件的主人，也有的是做条件的奴隶。做主人，就可以掌握条件，把不利条件化为有利条件，为自己创造各种各样好的条件。毛主席说，一穷二白看起来是坏事，其实是好事，穷则思变，要干，要革命，一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。原来被当作坏事，现在被看成好事，这不是把不利条件变为有利条件了吗？做条件的奴隶，有利条件也会转化为不利条件。今年全国各地小麦丰产经验非常丰富，只要认真学习这些经验，就可使自己地区的小麦同样获得丰收。这是个好条件。但有人却在全国小麦大丰收面前悲观失望，甘心落后。
    从这可以看出，在许多条件中，有一个是起着决定作用的条件，这就是人的思想，人的主观能动作用。虚心承认落后，但不甘心落后，这是个绝好的条件；不虚心承认落后，但甘心落后，这是个不好的条件。有了后边这个条件，做什么事也不会成功，做什么事也会落在人家的后边。不改变这个条件，那就要永远落后。
    “条件论”既然不会绝迹，我们就必须同它斗争到底。这也是矛盾的统一，有“条件论”，就有反“条件论”。“条件论”是很喜欢比的，要斗倒“条件论”，也就要用比的方法，这叫做“以子之矛，攻子之盾”。蒲城县同“条件论”斗争时，就拿澄城县来比。澄城县今年出现了十六颗千斤至一千五百斤的小麦“卫星”，而条件却与蒲城县相同。这一下可驳倒了“渭北高原小麦低产论”，“条件不足论”。
    现在各地正是种麦的时候，有不少人要在明年创造更多更大的小麦“卫星”和大面积的丰产。这当然是好的，值得大家学习。但是也有少数人不敢提出创造更多更大的“卫星”和提出更大一些面积的丰产指标，甚至连原来的指标都不想保持。这又是“条件论”在作怪。因此，驳倒“条件论”，就成了争取明年小麦全面大丰产的关键问题。
