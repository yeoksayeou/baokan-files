Welcome the Envoys of the Bulgarian People

    The envoys of the Bulgarian people—the Bulgarian National Assembly Delegation headed by Comrade Chervenkov—arrives in Beijing today. At this moment, our country is in the era of the Great Leap Forward, with molten iron flowing everywhere and abundant harvests; our people are mobilizing to oppose the U.S. imperialist military provocations and war threats in our Taiwan region. At this time, the Bulgarian people, who have always deeply cared for our socialist construction and firmly supported our people's just struggle against American aggression, have sent their representatives to our country for a friendly visit. The Chinese people, with excitement and gratitude, extend a warm welcome to the honored guests and pay our highest respect.
    The Chinese people have always watched the heroic cause of the Bulgarian people's socialist construction with admiration and joy. We are pleased to see that under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian people have transformed their motherland from a backward agricultural country into a socialist country with developed industry and large-scale cooperative and mechanized agriculture in the short span of fourteen years since liberation. In 1957, the ratio of industrial output value to agricultural output value in Bulgaria's total national economic output was already 68.3 to 31.7. Before World War II, Bulgaria was at the same level as Greece and Turkey in terms of industrial development. In 1957, Bulgaria's industrial output increased sevenfold compared to the pre-war year of 1939, while Greece only increased by 90% by 1956, and Turkey only increased by more than twofold. Bulgaria's agriculture has also made significant achievements. The socialist transformation of Bulgaria's agriculture is about to be fully completed. At present, more than 94% of the peasant households in Bulgaria have joined agricultural cooperatives, and the cultivated land of agricultural cooperatives and state farms accounts for 93% of the total cultivated land in the country. Basic agricultural operations have been mechanized. In 1957, the total agricultural output of the country increased by 25% compared to 1952. With the growth of industrial and agricultural production, the living standards of the Bulgarian people have been significantly improved. The brilliant achievements made by the Bulgarian people in the past fourteen years prove the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the great vitality of Marxism-Leninism.
    The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, held in June this year, summarized the past achievements and experiences, and adopted the third Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. The implementation of this plan will undoubtedly ensure the further upsurge of Bulgaria's national economy and strengthen the forces of world peace, democracy, and socialism. China and Bulgaria are both inseparable parts of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese people regard the victory of the people of every country in the socialist camp as the common victory of the entire camp, and the Chinese people are deeply proud of every achievement of our Bulgarian brothers.
    The Bulgarian people have carried forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Bulgarian working class, consistently adhered to the principle of proletarian internationalism, and made important contributions in strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, defending the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and the great struggle to criticize modern revisionism. In the past two years, delegations of the Bulgarian Communist Party, government, and parliament have extensively visited the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries, and signed a series of agreements to strengthen friendly relations with them, thereby promoting the unity and cooperation of the socialist camp. The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, held in June this year, firmly supported the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries and severely criticized modern revisionism. All these facts powerfully demonstrate that the Bulgarian people under the wise leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party are worthy of being outstanding children of Dimitrov, an outstanding activist in the international communist movement who was loyal to Marxism-Leninism.
    The profound friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people, built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, is unbreakable. In recent years, the friendship between our two peoples has been further developed. The economic and cultural ties between China and Bulgaria are increasingly strengthening. At the beginning of this year, the volume of trade between the two countries had increased more than threefold compared to 1952, when the first trade agreement was signed. The 1958-1960 trade and payment agreement between China and Bulgaria ensures the further expansion of economic ties between the two countries. Mutual visits of cultural workers, scientists, artists, and others from China and Bulgaria are also becoming more frequent. The Chinese people often hear the voice of the Bulgarian people's friendship towards the Chinese people. Just these few days, we were pleased to learn that the Bulgarian people have been holding rallies to protest against the armed provocations of the American robbers against the Chinese people. A Bulgarian worker said it well: "The security of the Chinese people is closely linked with the security of the entire socialist camp. If we are forced to take up arms, then the shameless aggressors will be completely annihilated." The Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude for the support of the Bulgarian brothers.
    Last year, a delegation of our National People's Congress headed by Comrade Peng Zhen visited Bulgaria; a Bulgarian government delegation headed by Comrade Yugov visited our country. This year, a delegation of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Dong Biwu attended the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Through these visits, the unity and cooperation between the Chinese and Bulgarian people have been further strengthened. Now, the Bulgarian National Assembly Delegation headed by Comrade Chervenkov has been invited to visit our country. We are confident that this visit of the Bulgarian National Assembly Delegation will make new contributions to the further development of friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Bulgarian people and the unity of the socialist camp. We sincerely wish that the fraternal and unbreakable friendship between China and Bulgaria will be further consolidated and developed, and we sincerely wish that the unity of the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union will be further strengthened.

### 欢迎保加利亚人民的使者

    欢迎保加利亚人民的使者
    保加利亚人民的使者——以契尔文科夫同志为首的保加利亚国民议会代表团今日到达北京。今天，我国正处在大跃进的时代，到处铁水奔流，五谷丰登；我国人民正在动员起来，反对美帝国主义在我国台湾地区的军事挑衅和战争威胁。在这个时刻，一向深切关怀我国社会主义建设和坚决支持我国人民反对美国侵略的正义斗争的保加利亚人民，派遣了他的代表前来我国进行友好访问。我国人民怀着兴奋和感谢的心情，向贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎，并致以崇高的敬意。
    中国人民一向怀着钦佩和欢欣的心情注视着保加利亚人民建设社会主义的英雄事业。我们高兴地看到，保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的领导下，在解放后短短的十四年间，已经把自己的祖国从一个落后的农业国建成了一个拥有发达的工业和大规模合作化与机械化农业的社会主义国家。在1957年保加利亚国民经济总产值中，工业产值同农业产值的对比，已经是六十八点三比三十一点七。在第二次世界大战以前，保加利亚在工业发展方面同希腊、土耳其居于同一水平。1957年保加利亚的工业产量已比战前1939年增加了七倍，而希腊到1956年只增加了90％，土耳其只增加了一倍多。保加利亚的农业也取得了重大的成就。保加利亚农业的社会主义改造即将全部完成。目前，保加利亚全国已有94％以上的农户加入了农业合作社，农业合作社和国营农场的耕地已占全国耕地总面积的93％。基本农业操作都已机械化。1957年保全国农业总产量比1952年增加了25％。随着工农业生产的增长，保加利亚人民生活水平有了显著的提高。十四年来保加利亚人民所取得的辉煌成就，证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性和马克思列宁主义的伟大生命力。
    今年6月举行的保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会，总结了过去的成就和经验，通过了发展国民经济的第三个五年计划。这个计划的实现无疑将保证保加利亚国民经济的进一步高涨，增强世界和平、民主和社会主义的力量。中国和保加利亚都是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的不可分割的部分。中国人民把社会主义阵营中每一个国家人民的胜利看成是整个阵营的共同胜利，中国人民深深为保加利亚兄弟的每一成就而骄傲。
    保加利亚人民发扬了保加利亚工人阶级的光荣的革命传统，一贯地忠实于无产阶级国际主义的原则，在加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、捍卫马克思列宁主义的原则和批判现代修正主义的伟大斗争中作出了重要的贡献。最近两年来，保加利亚共产党、政府和议会代表团曾经广泛地访问了苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家，并同它们签订了一系列的加强友好关系的协定，从而促进了社会主义阵营的团结和合作。在今年6月召开的保共第七次代表大会坚决支持各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议宣言并对现代修正主义进行了严正的批判。所有这些事实都有力地表明，在保加利亚共产党英明领导下的保加利亚人民不愧是忠实于马克思列宁主义的国际共产主义运动的卓越活动家季米特洛夫的优秀子弟。
    建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的中保两国人民的深厚友谊是牢不可破的。近年来，我们两国人民的友谊有了进一步的发展。中保两国的经济和文化联系正在日益加强。今年年初，两国的换货量已比签订第一个贸易协定的1952年增加了两倍以上。中保两国1958年到1960年的换货和付款协定，保证两国经济联系的进一步扩大。中保两国的文化工作者、科学家、艺术家等的相互访问也越来越频繁。中国人民常常听到保加利亚人民对中国人民的友谊的声音。就在这几天，我们高兴地知道保加利亚人民纷纷集会抗议美国强盗对中国人民的武装挑衅。保加利亚的一位工人说得好：“中国人民的安全是同整个社会主义阵营的安全紧密地连在一起的。如果我们被迫拿起武器，那时，无耻的侵略者就将被彻底消灭。”中国人民对保加利亚兄弟的支持表示衷心的感谢。
    去年，以彭真同志为首的我国全国人民代表大会代表团访问了保加利亚；以于哥夫同志为首的保加利亚政府代表团访问了我国。今年，以董必武同志为首的中国共产党代表团参加了保共第七次代表大会。经过这些访问中保两国人民的团结和合作有了更进一步的加强。现在，以契尔文科夫同志为首的保加利亚国民议会代表团应邀来到我国访问了。我们确信，保加利亚国民议会代表团的这次访问，对于进一步发展中保两国人民的友好合作和社会主义阵营的团结，将作出新的贡献。我们谨祝中保两国兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊进一步巩固和发展，谨祝以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结进一步加强。
