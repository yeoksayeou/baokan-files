Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: According to American news agencies, U.S. Pacific Command Commander Felt held a military meeting in Taipei on the 22nd to plot intensified military provocations and armed aggression against China. The meeting discussed the "urgent need for the U.S. military to transport more supplies into the besieged coastal island fortress of Jinmen (Quemoy)" and "the future role of the U.S. military in the Taiwan Strait crisis," among other issues.

This military meeting of high-ranking U.S. generals in Taipei was held after the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff announced on the 19th the establishment of a Forward Combat Headquarters in Taiwan. This expanded U.S. military command in Taiwan is under the jurisdiction of Felt's U.S. Pacific Command.

At the same time, the U.S. invading forces have also intensified military threats in the Taiwan Strait area. According to reports, U.S. Air Force FE-101 Voodoo photographic reconnaissance aircraft are flying over the Taiwan Strait, secretly photographing the Chinese mainland. The radar unit of the U.S. 17th Tactical Missile Air Force Squadron, entrenched in the Penghu Islands, not only guides U.S. ships and aircraft in provocative activities against China, but also assumes full responsibility for using radar to direct the Chiang Kai-shek bandit air force in sabotage and harassment of the coastal areas of mainland China. The U.S. Air Force has transferred a group of U.S. military radar station technicians from Guam, the Philippines, northern Japan, and Okinawa to Taiwan, Penghu, and enemy-occupied islands along the Fujian coast to participate in the aggressive activities against China.

U.S. imperialism is also stepping up its nuclear intimidation against the Chinese people and the people of Asia. On the 9th, Bickley admitted to reporters that a "special weapons group on U.S. Seventh Fleet warships had partially assembled nuclear weapons during the Taiwan Strait crisis. The flagship Helena and the heavy cruiser Columbus were equipped with Regulus atomic missiles. The Seventh Fleet is now conducting training exercises near the coast of Taiwan." It is reported that the United States has also equipped Taiwan with "Matador" surface-to-surface missiles, "Nike-Hercules" surface-to-air missiles, and "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles. The U.S. missile forces invading Taiwan are in a state of combat readiness day and night, ready to launch these nuclear weapons at any time.

    美国加紧对我国军事威胁
    美军头目集会策划武装侵略活动
    据新华社22日讯　据美国通讯社报道：美国太平洋地区部队总司令费耳特22日在台北召开了军事会议，策划对中国加紧军事挑衅和武装侵略活动。会议上讨论了美军“把更多的供应品运入被围沿海岛屿金门要塞的迫切需要”以及“美军将来在台湾海峡危机中的作用”等问题。
    美国高级将领这次在台北举行的军事会议，是在美国参谋长联席会议19日宣布在台湾成立前进战斗司令部以后召开的，这个扩大了的侵台美军司令部就是由费耳特的美国太平洋地区部队司令部统辖。
    同时，美国侵略军在台湾海峡地区也加紧了军事威胁。有消息说，美国空军FE——一○一伏杜式摄影侦察机正在台湾海峡地区飞行，偷摄中国大陆的照片。盘踞澎湖列岛的美国第十七战术导弹空军中队的雷达部队不但引导美国的舰只和飞机向中国进行挑衅活动，并且负起了用雷达指挥蒋贼空军向中国大陆沿海地区破坏和骚扰的全部责任。美国空军从关岛、菲律宾、日本北部地区和冲绳岛等地调了一批美军雷达站的技术人员到台湾、澎湖和福建沿海敌占岛屿，参加对中国的侵略活动。
    美帝国主义还加紧对中国人民和亚洲人民进行原子恫吓。比克利9日对新闻记者谈话时供认，美国第七舰队“军舰上的一个特别武器组已经在台湾海峡危机期间把原子武器部分地装配起来。旗舰海伦娜号和重巡洋舰哥伦布号都配备了雷克鲁斯式原子导弹。第七舰队现在在台湾海岸附近进行训练演习。”据悉，美国在台湾还装备了“斗牛士式”地对地导弹，“奈克—赫尔克里士式”地对空导弹，“响尾蛇式”空对空导弹等。侵台美军导弹部队日夜处于备战状态，随时准备发射这种核武器。
