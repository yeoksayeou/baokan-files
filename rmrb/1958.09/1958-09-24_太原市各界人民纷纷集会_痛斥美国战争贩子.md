Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 22nd: People from all walks of life in Taiyuan City, including officers and soldiers, factory and mine workers, suburban farmers, as well as staff from stores and schools, have been holding rallies to warmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and to angrily condemn the shameless nonsense of the American warmonger Dulles. They are determined to use their practical actions to fully support the struggle to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan. After listening to the broadcast on the evening of the 21st, commanders of the Shanxi Military Region immediately gathered. Liu Shihong, Director of the Cadre Department of the Military Region, angrily said that the United States imperialism, disregarding our government's nine solemn warnings, is still carrying out provocative activities in the Taiwan Strait, which we will never tolerate. Liang Jiangong, Deputy Political Commissar of the Jinan Military Sub-district, and responsible cadres from Changzhi, Yanbei, Yuci, Xin County and other military sub-districts, who were participating in the enlarged meeting of the Shanxi Military Region Party Committee, unanimously expressed their determination to vigorously promote steel production, strengthen military training of troops and militia, and be ready to go to the front at any time.

The 1,400 activists participating in the Taiyuan Youth Socialist Construction Activist Conference held a rally on the evening of the 21st. Liu Qingfang, Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and Chairman of the Taiyuan Youth Federation, said on behalf of the 250,000 youths in the city that Dulles's so-called "ceasefire" is complete nonsense. If the American aggressors dare to impose war on us, we will smash them to pieces. Zhang Yiniu, a member of the Yuejin People's Commune in the suburbs of Taiyuan City, said on behalf of the young militiamen at the meeting that we must grasp steel and grain with both hands, practice our martial arts well, and wait for the motherland's order to go to the front immediately. All the commanders and fighters of the "Iron and Steel Reserve Division" of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company have been holding meetings for the past two days while continuing production beside the raging blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces. Wang Guiying, chairman of the Iron and Steel Company's trade union and a national model worker, said that Dulles's stinking speech is complete nonsense. We must once again warn him that the entire Chinese people are unprecedentedly united and strong, the great Soviet neighbor and the people of socialist countries stand with us, and peace-loving people all over the world stand with us. We have enough strength and unwavering determination to liberate Jinmen, Mazu and Taiwan.
