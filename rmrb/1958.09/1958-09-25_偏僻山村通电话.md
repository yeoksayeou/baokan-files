    Telephones Reach Remote Mountain Villages
    The most remote mountain area in Fujian Province, the Kengdi District of Shouning, now has telephone service in every township. Kengdi District is located in high mountains and valleys, and transportation is very inconvenient. In July, the Shouning County Party Committee erected telephone lines in all seven townships of the district and installed loudspeakers. Now, after dinner every evening, many farmers, both men and women, gather under the loudspeakers to listen to beautiful radio programs.

    偏僻山村通电话
    福建省最偏僻的山区，寿宁坑底区也已乡乡通电话了。坑底区处于高山峻岭之中，交通非常不便。寿宁县委于7月间在这个区的七个乡全部架起了电话，并且装上了广播筒。现在每天晚饭后，许多男女农民都聚集在广播筒下，收听优美的广播节目。
