    Less Money, Faster Construction, Better Quality
    Harbin Builds "Four No's" Building
    No Steel, No Cement, No Wood, No Bricks
    (Our newspaper, Harbin, 18th dispatch) Harbin City recently built a three-story, 1,136-square-meter prefabricated building that uses no steel, cement, wood, or red bricks. People call it the "Four No's" building. This creative method has written a new page in the history of architecture.
    The floor slabs, beams, columns, and stairs of the "Four No's" building are made of large silicate blocks reinforced with fiberglass and bamboo, replacing red bricks, cement, and steel; the doors and windows of the building are made of magnesite, using no wood; the radiators are made of white porcelain, which is clean and beautiful, and the heating pipes are made of glass. At the same time, because it uses prefabricated components, it greatly shortens construction time and saves labor. It is estimated that, under normal construction conditions, such a building can be completed in just five or six days.
    After quality inspection, the quality of this building is not only no lower than that of buildings constructed with steel and cement, but it also has the advantages of being fireproof, cold-proof, heat-insulating, and wear-resistant.
    This advanced experience of building without steel, cement, wood, or red bricks is the result of collective research and cooperation by the Harbin First Construction Engineering Company, the Civil Engineering Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Harbin Design Institute, under the direct leadership of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. This experience not only solves the current difficulties of insufficient steel, cement, wood, and red brick construction materials, but more importantly, opens up new directions for building materials. These building materials are readily available everywhere and can be sourced and manufactured locally. For example, silicate is made of shale, white lime, slag, coarse sand, gypsum, stone, and other materials. Magnesite is available throughout the country. Building with these materials costs less, is faster, and the quality is good. One cubic meter of silicate block reduces costs by 28.6% compared to the same red brick masonry, and reduces the cost by 37.44% compared to 110-grade concrete blocks. Doors and windows made of magnesite reduce costs by 39% compared to wood products. Ceramic radiators reduce costs by 30% compared to iron products. In terms of quality, the strength of silicate blocks reaches the standard of 100-grade concrete blocks, and is three to four times higher than the strength of red brick masonry. Using new building materials to construct buildings has significant economic benefits. According to preliminary calculations, Harbin City's construction tasks for next year require 800 million red bricks, which not only exceeds the production capacity of red brick factories, but also requires 1,464 mu of arable land for soil burning. If silicate components are used, there is no need to damage arable land and a large amount of cement can be saved. According to preliminary calculations, if silicate is used to replace 50% of the total amount of concrete in next year's construction tasks, 200,000 tons of cement can be saved.
    Most of the various new building materials used in this building can be promoted at present.

    花钱少　建设快　质量好
    哈尔滨修建“四不用”大楼
    不用钢材　不用水泥　不用木材　不用红砖
    本报哈尔滨18日电　哈尔滨市最近修建了一幢不用钢材、水泥、木材、红砖的预制装配式的一千一百三十六平方公尺的三层大楼。人们都叫它是“四不用”大楼。这个创造性的方法，为建筑史上写下了新的一页。
    “四不用”大楼的楼板、梁、柱、楼梯是用矽酸盐加玻璃丝筋和竹筋制成的大砌块，代替红砖、水泥和钢筋；大楼的门窗是用菱苦土制成的，不用木材；暖气片是白瓷的，又干净又漂亮，暖气管道是玻璃制成的。同时，因为它采用了预制装配式，也大大缩短了建筑时间和节约了劳动力。据估计，在正常施工情况下，这样一座大楼只要五、六天就可建成。
    经过质量检验，这幢大楼的质量不仅不低于用钢筋、水泥的建筑的大楼，并且更具有防火、防寒、保温、耐磨等优点。
    这种建设大楼不用钢材、水泥、木材、红砖的先进经验，是在中共哈尔滨市委的直接领导下，由哈尔滨第一建筑工程公司、中国科学院土建研究所和哈尔滨设计院三个单位集体研究共同合作的结果。这个经验不仅解决了当前钢材、水泥、木材、红砖建设材料不足的困难，更重要的是为建筑材料开拓了新的方向。这种建筑材料到处皆是，可以就地取材、就地制造。例如矽酸盐是采用页岩、白灰、炉渣、粗砂、石膏、石子等材料制成的。菱苦土全国各处都有。用这些材料建大楼花钱少，建筑快，而且质量又好。一立方公尺的矽酸盐砌块比同样的红砖砌体成本可降低28.6％，比110号的混凝土砌块化的成本降低37.44％。用菱苦土做的门窗比木制品成本降低39％。陶瓷暖气片比铁制品成本降低30％。在质量上，矽酸盐砌块的强度达到了100号混凝土砌块的标准，比红砖砌体的强度也高三至四倍。采用新型建筑材料建设大楼，具有重大的经济意义。据初步计算，哈尔滨市明年的建设任务需要红砖八亿块，这不仅红砖厂生产能力不够，而且要有一千四百六十四亩耕地供土烧砖。如果采用矽酸盐构件，既不用挖坏耕地还可大量节省水泥。据初步计算，明年建设任务中如用矽酸盐代替混凝土总量的50％，就可以节省水泥二十万吨。
    这个大楼采用的各种新型建筑材料，绝大部分目前都可以推广。
