    To Make Blast Furnaces Ubiquitous and Iron Flowing Constantly
    Wang Zhongying, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Wanxian District Committee, Sichuan Province
    Our Wanxian area is mostly mountainous, and there was no foundation for the iron and steel industry in the past. Now, under the call of the Party Central Committee to "fight for steel," the 5.4 million people in the district are breaking down superstitions, working with soaring energy, mobilizing masses of troops and horses, and engaging in mass movements to extract minerals from the deep mountains and iron from blast furnaces. Indigenous blast furnaces are developing at a rapid pace, with dozens being completed and put into production every day. So far, more than 2,000 blast furnaces have been built, and more than 1,000 more are under construction. As a folk song describes: "Yesterday the mountain bends were quiet, today iron furnaces are all over the mountainside, factories are run in every township and commune, and the smoke from iron furnaces fills the mountains."
    The rapid development of indigenous blast furnaces is primarily due to the fact that Party committees at all levels have implemented the Party Central Committee's policy of taking steel as the key link, strengthened leadership in running industry, with the first secretaries personally taking command to grasp steel, and commanders at all levels personally going to the front line, going deep into construction sites, engaging in experimental plots, and specifically solving problems in infrastructure construction and production. This has greatly promoted the progress of indigenous blast furnace construction. The district committee also dispatched working groups to go deep into the counties to grasp furnaces. When these commanders arrived at the scene, a new situation immediately emerged in production, and pig iron was produced more and faster.
    We must believe in the masses and rely on the masses. We must believe that once the Party's guidelines and policies are grasped by the broad masses, they will generate immeasurable power. The masses have great enthusiasm and high morale, and can solve any difficulties. They use hard work and shock tactics to build furnaces. The secretary of the Sanhe Township General Branch in Fengjie County personally led more than 3,000 people, working hard for five days and nights, building 18 furnaces, mining more than 200,000 catties of ore, mining more than 60,000 catties of coal, digging up more than 10,000 catties of tree roots, and building seven coking kilns with a daily output of six tons. On the iron and steel front, everyone is Zhuge Liang, everyone can come up with ideas, using mud to build when there are no stones, and using earthen bellows when there is no power. Men, women, old and young have all participated in the movement to produce pig iron on a large scale, demonstrating the heroic spirit of going all out, aiming high, and striving for the upstream.
    On the basis of the Party committee taking command and mobilizing the masses, we must also pay attention to cultivating technical forces, adopting the method of technical return, finding local furnace masters, tapping the potential of veteran workers, uniting and relying on technical personnel, using the old to lead the new, masters to teach apprentices, engaging in experimental plots, and holding on-site meetings. As the technical force has gradually grown stronger, and with the in-depth research of veteran workers and local technical personnel, experiences such as cold air full coke, full white coal, coal briquette iron smelting, and blast coking have been created, opening up a new path for solving the difficulty of fuel shortage in iron smelting.
    A key issue we need to address at present is that some indigenous blast furnaces cannot produce iron normally, and the output of some that have already produced iron is not very high. This requires us to muster even greater efforts, organize forces, and carry out shock tactics to quickly change the current situation of indigenous blast furnaces not producing iron or producing little iron, and strive to increase the output of small furnaces several times over. We must also further grasp technical innovation, promote advanced experience, rapidly catch up with ore and fuel, and speed up the transportation, this vanguard.
    The conservative thinking that steel cannot be produced in remote mountainous areas has been burned to ashes by the iron flowing day and night. We must make blast furnaces ubiquitous and iron flow constantly throughout the entire special district. Our Wanxian area will dedicate at least 100,000 tons of pig iron to the motherland this year, and several times more next year!

### 要使高炉遍地，铁水长流

    千军万马搞生铁
    本报编辑在四川万县专区编的专页
    要使高炉遍地，铁水长流
    中共四川省万县地委副书记  王仲英
    我们万县地区大部分是山区，过去根本没有钢铁工业的基础；现在，在党中央的“为钢而战”的号召下，全区五百四十万人大破迷信，干劲冲天，千军万马，大搞群众运动向深山要矿，向高炉要铁。土高炉正以飞快的速度发展着，每天都有几十个完工，几十个投入生产，到现在，已经有两千多个高炉建成。还有一千多个高炉正在兴建。正如一首民歌所描写的：“昨日山弯静悄悄，今朝铁炉遍山腰，乡乡社社办工厂，铁炉烟雾满山飘。”
    土高炉发展这样快，首先由于各级党委贯彻了党中央提出的以钢为纲的方针，加强了办工业的领导，第一书记亲自挂帅抓钢铁，各级指挥员亲自上前线，深入工地，搞试验田，具体解决基建和生产中的问题，这样就大大推动了土高炉的基建进度。地委又派出了工作组深入到县里抓炉子，当这些挂帅人一到现场，生产上便立即出现了新局面，生铁就出得又多又快了。
    一定要相信群众，依靠群众。要相信党的方针政策为广大群众掌握后，就一定会产生不可估量的力量。群众干劲大，斗志高，什么困难都能解决。他们用苦战的办法突击的办法建炉。奉节县三合乡总支书记亲自率领三千多人，苦战五昼夜，建炉十八座，挖矿石二十多万斤，采煤六万多斤，挖树蔸子万多斤，建起日产六吨的炼焦窑七座。在钢铁战线上，人人都是诸葛亮，个个都能出主意，没有石头用泥筑，没有动力用土风箱。男女老幼都参加了大搞生铁的运动，显示出了鼓足干劲、力争上游的英雄气概。
    在党委挂帅、发动群众的基础上，还要注意培养技术力量，采取技术归队，找土炉师，挖掘老工人的潜力，团结和依靠技术人员，以老带新，师傅带徒弟，搞试验田，开现场会。由于技术力量逐步壮大，老工人、土技术人员的深入钻研，创造了冷风全焦、全白煤、煤球炼铁、鼓风炼焦等经验，为解决炼铁缺燃料的困难开辟了一条新的道路。
    我们当前要解决的一个关键性的问题，就是还有一部分土高炉不能正常出铁，有些已出铁的产量还不太高。这就需要鼓足更大的干劲，组织力量，进行突击，迅速改变当前土高炉不出铁或出铁少的状况，争取使小炉产量番上加番，也还要进一步抓住技术革新，推广先进经验；矿石、燃料迅速跟上去；交通运输这个先行官也要快马加鞭。
    那种认为在偏僻山区不能搞钢铁的保守思想，已经被日夜奔流的铁水烧成灰烬。在全专区内要使高炉遍地、铁水长流。我们万县地区，今年要向祖国献出至少十万吨生铁，明年还要翻上几番！
