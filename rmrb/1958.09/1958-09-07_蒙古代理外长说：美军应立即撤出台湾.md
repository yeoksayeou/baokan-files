Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 6th. The acting Foreign Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, Shagdar Surun, today made a statement to Xinhua reporters on the issue of US armed provocations in the Taiwan Strait, saying that after the Anglo-American imperialist aggression in Lebanon and Jordan was opposed and struck by peace-loving people, the United States is now provoking the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan Strait, attempting to undermine world peace and create tensions in the Far East.
    The US colonialists' aggressive plans against the People's Republic of China are bound to go bankrupt completely, just as their armed aggression in the Middle East has failed.
    The United States is establishing missile and military bases in Taiwan and its surrounding islands, and holding military exercises with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, attempting to threaten the people of Asia with a new war. This has aroused the anger and condemnation of the Mongolian people. No matter how the US imperialists intensify their aggressive activities against China, and no matter how they use US "aid" and weapons to support the Chiang Kai-shek clique, it is impossible to save the traitor Chiang Kai-shek from destruction.
    Shagdar Surun emphasized that Taiwan and its surrounding islands are all part of Chinese territory. The US authorities' policy toward Taiwan is an act of blatant interference in the internal affairs of other countries in violation of international norms. The Mongolian people demand the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Taiwan.
    Shagdar Surun continued, saying that the Mongolian government and all the Mongolian people warmly support the measures taken by the government of the People's Republic of China to stop the provocative behavior of the US-Chiang clique and to defend peace in Asia and the world. Shagdar Surun concluded by saying that the Mongolian people and the Mongolian government firmly believe that the Chinese people, who have the sympathy and support of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people, will surely achieve victory in their just struggle to recover their territory. The people of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving forces stand with the Chinese people.

    蒙古代理外长说：美军应立即撤出台湾
    新华社乌兰巴托6日电　蒙古人民共和国代理外交部长沙格达尔苏伦今天就美国在台湾海峡进行武装挑衅的问题对新华社记者发表谈话说，美英帝国主义在黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略遭到爱好和平的人民的反对和打击以后，美国现在又在台湾海峡向中华人民共和国进行挑衅，企图破坏世界和平和制造远东紧张局势。
    美国殖民主义者对中华人民共和国的侵略计划必定遭到彻底破产，正如它在中东的武装侵略遭到失败一样。
    美国在台湾及其附近岛屿建立导弹和军事基地，并且同蒋介石集团举行军事演习，企图用新的战争来威胁亚洲人民。这引起了蒙古人民的愤怒和谴责。无论美帝国主义者怎样加紧对中国的侵略活动，也不管怎样用美“援”及武器来扶植蒋介石集团，都不可能把蒋介石卖国贼从灭亡中拯救出来。
    沙格达尔苏伦强调说，台湾及其附近的岛屿都是中国领土的一部分，美国当局对台湾的政策是违反国际准则粗暴干涉他国内政的行为，蒙古人民要求立即从台湾撤出美国军队。
    沙格达尔苏伦继续说，蒙古政府和全体蒙古人民热烈支持中华人民共和国政府对制止美蒋集团挑衅行为、为保卫亚洲和世界和平而采取的措施。沙格达尔苏伦最后说，蒙古人民和蒙古政府坚信得到亿万爱好和平人民的同情和支持的中国人民，在收回自己的领土的正义斗争中一定会取得胜利。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民及全体爱好和平的力量都和中国人民站在一起。
