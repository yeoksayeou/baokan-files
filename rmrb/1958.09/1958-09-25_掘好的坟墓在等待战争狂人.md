    The Dug Grave Awaits the Warmongers
    Ji Fang, Acting Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party
    The American aggressors, braving the world's condemnation, persist in being hostile to the Chinese people. In the face of the powerful demonstrations of 300 million people in urban and rural China against American aggression, in the face of the artillery fire punishing the Jinmen (Quemoy) Chiang troops and Chiang's ships protected by the United States, in the face of the solemn warning from the Soviet Union's Khrushchev that "an attack on China is an attack on the Soviet Union," and in the face of the severe condemnation of the people of the world, they show no repentance. Not only do they fail to withdraw their invading armed forces from the Taiwan area, but they repeatedly slander our people's sacred action of liberating their own territory as "aggression," preposterously proposing the so-called "ceasefire." Moreover, disregarding the twelve warnings already issued by our government, they continue to intrude into our territorial waters and airspace for serious military provocations, interfering with our people's recovery of Jinmen (Quemoy), Mazu (Matsu) and other coastal islands. This cannot but arouse our greater anger and further strengthen our determination to resist aggression.
    Eisenhower and Dulles and their ilk, in their statements and speeches at the United Nations General Assembly, have exhausted their ability to slander and intimidate, and have exhausted all the tricks of rogue hooligans. But China is no longer the China of a hundred years ago, and the world is no longer a world where gunboat policy reigns supreme. As the People's Daily editorial said: "The Chinese people cannot be intimidated or defeated." Taiwan is Chinese territory, and we must liberate it from the rule of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. Since we have this determination, no force can stop us. If we were able to defeat the American imperialist aggressors on the Korean battlefield six or seven years ago, then today, when the Chinese people are moving mountains and seas with the force of a thunderbolt, forcing even high mountains and great rivers to bow and give way, what is there that is unconquerable? The natural gods with unparalleled power have already succumbed to the hands of the Chinese people, so what can the long-punctured paper tiger do?
    The American ruling clique should stop dreaming of dominating the globe! They should wake up. Although they have formally rejected Khrushchev's warning letter, they probably have to weigh the weight of this letter. In addition, even a "for reference only, not for publication" document issued by the United States Information Service on September 16th is worth Eisenhower and Dulles using as a cooling agent. It says: "News from Washington and capitals around the world, published in American newspapers, continues to provide a comprehensive impression of our major allies and Asian countries holding critical – even hostile – attitudes toward the U.S. policy toward China. All of this news emphasizes the strong opposition to U.S. military activities in Jinmen (Quemoy), and even stronger hope for 'not getting involved'." Doesn't this further illustrate the unprecedented isolation and crisis of the American aggressors?
    The American aggressors should be told once again that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement represents the greatest determination of the 600 million Chinese people: "If the American aggressors, regardless of the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and the firm opposition of the people of the world, dare to impose war on the Chinese people, then our united 600 million people will not hesitate to sacrifice themselves and fight under the sacred banner of defending the great motherland, to fight against aggression, to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world!" This is also our oath to turn anger into strength. We vow to liberate Taiwan with all our strength, and we vow to defeat all aggressors with all our strength. If Eisenhower and Dulles and their ilk insist on maintaining their imperialist prestige, refuse to admit their predicament and failure, and try to look tough to conceal their weakness, and insist on competing with the Chinese people, then what awaits the warmongers is definitely not an "adventurer's paradise," but a grave that has already been dug.

    掘好的坟墓在等待战争狂人
    中国农工民主党中央代理主席  季方
    美国侵略者甘冒天下之大不韪，坚持与中国人民为敌，在全中国城乡三亿人民反对美国侵略的强大示威面前、在严惩金门蒋军和受美国保护的蒋军舰只的炮火面前、在苏联赫鲁晓夫所作“对中国的侵犯就是对苏联的侵犯”的严正警告面前、在全世界人民的严厉谴责面前，竟然毫不悔改，不仅不把它的侵略武装力量撤出台湾地区；相反地竟多次污蔑我国人民解放自己领土的神圣的行动为“侵略”，荒谬地提出所谓“停火”的主张，并且不顾我国政府已经提出的十二次警告，不断继续地侵入我领海领空进行严重的军事挑衅，干涉我国人民收复金门马祖等沿海岛屿。这不能不激起我们更大的愤怒，不能不更加坚定我们反击侵略的决心。
    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯之流，在他们的一些声明和联合国大会的发言里面，竭尽污蔑恐吓之能事，耍尽了流氓无赖的伎俩。可是中国早已不是一百年前的中国，世界也早已不是炮舰政策称雄的世界了。正如人民日报社论所说：“中国人民是吓不倒和打不倒的。”台湾是中国的领土，我们一定要把它从卖国贼蒋介石的统治之下解放出来，我们既然有了这个决心，那是任何力量也不能够阻挡住的。如果说在六、七年前我们都能在朝鲜战场上击败美帝国主义者的侵略，在今天，中国人民正以雷霆万钧之势，移山造海之力，使得高山大河也不得不低头让路，那么，还有什么不可战胜的呢？具有无比威力的自然之神都已经在中国人民的手中屈服了，早已戳破了的纸老虎又有什么能耐呢？
    美国统治集团不要再做他独霸全球的迷梦了！应该清醒清醒了。对赫鲁晓夫的警告信虽然形式上作了拒绝，但恐怕也不能不掂掂这封信的份量，此外即使美国新闻处9月16日发出的一篇“仅供参考不供发表的资料”，也是值得艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之流作为一副清凉剂的。它里面说：“登载在美国报纸上的来自华盛顿和各国首都的消息，继续提供了我们的主要盟国和亚洲国家对美国的对华政策抱批评态度——甚至是敌对态度——的全面印象。所有这些消息都强调对美国在金门的军事活动的强烈反对，甚至更强烈地希望‘不要卷入’”。这难道还不能说明美国侵略者的空前孤立和危机吗？
    应该再一次告诉美国侵略者，陈毅外长的声明代表了中国六亿人民最大的决心：“如果美国侵略者竟然不顾中国人民的一再警告和世界人民的坚决反对，胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，那末，我国团结一致的六亿人民，必将不惜牺牲，在保卫伟大祖国的神圣旗帜下，为反抗侵略而战，为维护祖国的主权和领土完整而战，为保卫远东和世界的和平而战！”这也就是我们化愤怒为力量的誓言，我们誓以全力解放台湾，誓以全力战胜一切侵略者，如果艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之流硬要维持他帝国主义的威风，不肯承认自己的窘境和失败，打肿脸来充胖子，硬要与中国人民较量一番，那么等待着战争狂人的，决不是什么“冒险家的乐园”，而是掘好了的坟墓。
