Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th dispatch from TASS: Gromyko, head of the Soviet delegation to the 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly, delivered a letter to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 15th, suggesting that the issue of "stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons" be included on the agenda of the 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly as a major and pressing issue.

Gromyko's letter stated that the issue of stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons must be resolved as quickly as possible. Because the continued testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs will intensify the atomic arms race, fuel the production of nuclear weapons with even greater destructive power, and thus increase the risk of atomic war.

Each new nuclear explosion will generate a large amount of radioactive products, contaminating the atmosphere, soil, and seawater. If the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons is not stopped, then the danger of atomic radiation, which already threatens the lives and health of millions of people today, will become even more serious tomorrow. As everyone knows, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation recently emphasized this danger, and the General Assembly should treat this warning from scientists with the utmost seriousness.

The Geneva Conference of Experts reached a consensus that it is possible to establish an effective monitoring system to supervise compliance with an agreement on a universal cessation of nuclear tests. In this situation, it is intolerable to continue to delay the resolution of this important issue.

Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet government has been proposing an agreement on the immediate cessation of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons since 1955. In order to create a practical start for the universal cessation of nuclear testing, the Soviet government decided to unilaterally cease testing all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and called on the United States and Britain to follow the Soviet Union's example. This step by the Soviet government created favorable conditions for countries to immediately cease testing atomic and nuclear weapons. However, the United States and British governments not only did not follow the Soviet Union's example, but instead responded to the Soviet Union's proactive approach with a series of nuclear weapons test explosions, carried out with unprecedented intensity up to the present day. These actions show that the United States and British governments are attempting to take advantage of the Soviet Union's cessation of nuclear testing to gain a military advantage for themselves. Of course, the Soviet government cannot remain indifferent to this situation out of concern for Soviet security.

Gromyko said that the Soviet government believes that the United Nations has an obligation to take all necessary measures to actively resolve the issue of universally and permanently ceasing the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The Soviet government believes that the issue of stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons must be separated from the overall disarmament plan, and that this issue must be resolved independently and immediately.

    葛罗米柯写信给哈马舍尔德
    建议联大讨论停止核试验
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联出席联合国大会第十三届会议代表团团长葛罗米柯15日交给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德一封信，建议把“停止试验原子武器和氢武器”问题作为一个重大迫切的问题列入联合国大会第十三届会议的议程。
    葛罗米柯的信中说，必须尽速解决停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题。因为继续试验原子弹和氢弹，就会加剧原子军备竞赛，助长制造毁灭能力更大的核武器，因而增加爆发原子战争的危险。
    每一次新的核爆炸都将形成大量的放射性产物，感染大气、土壤、海水。如果不停止原子武器和氢武器的试验，那么今天就已经威胁着千百万人生命和健康的原子辐射危险，在明天将更加严重。大家知道，联合国原子辐射影响科学委员会不久前着重指出了这种危险，大会应当极其严肃地对待科学家的这一警告。
    日内瓦专家会议取得了一致的意见，认为有可能建立有效的监督体系，以监督遵守关于普遍停止核试验的协定，在这种情况下，在解决这个重要问题上继续拖延不决是不能容忍的。
    葛罗米柯指出，苏联政府从1955年起便建议就立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器达成协议。苏联政府为了给普遍停止核试验打开一个实际的开端，曾经决定苏联单方面停止试验一切种类的原子武器和氢武器，并呼吁美国和英国效法苏联的榜样。苏联政府的这个步骤为各国立即停止试验原子武器和核武器创造了有利条件。但是美国和英国政府不仅没有效法苏联的榜样，相反倒用直到现在为止还在空前紧张进行的一系列的核武器试验爆炸来回答苏联的这个主动做法。这些行动表明，美国和英国政府企图利用苏联停止核试验来取得自己在军事上的优势，当然，苏联政府出于苏联安全的考虑，对这种情况不能漠然视之。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联政府认为，联合国有义务采取一切必要的措施，来积极地解决关于普遍地永远地停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题。苏联政府认为，停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题必须同总的裁军计划分离开来，必须单独立即解决这一问题。
