    The Intruder's Conspiracy Exposed
    The People's Daily editorial published on September 15, "Cannot Be Deceived or Intimidated," is excellent. It thoroughly exposed the conspiracy of Eisenhower, the chief culprit and ferocious aggressor, and refuted his outrageous lies completely. It fully expressed the unwavering will of the Chinese people to resist aggression and defend the integrity of our motherland's territory and sovereignty. After reading it, I felt that it expressed what was in my heart. As a citizen, I warmly support the position and all the arguments stated in the editorial.

    揭穿了侵略者的阴谋
    人民日报9月15日发表的“骗不了也吓不倒”这篇社论好得很，把艾森豪威尔这个罪魁祸首、凶恶的侵略者的阴谋诡计彻底揭穿，把他天大的谎言驳斥得体无完肤，充分表达了我国人民反抗侵略保卫祖国领土主权完整的坚定不移的意志。读后感到把我心里的话都说出了，作为一个公民，我热烈拥护社论所表明的立场和全部论点。
