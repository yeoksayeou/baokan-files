    Special Feature: Night Camp of Returning Volunteer Army Troops - Friendship and Songs Everywhere on the Triumphant Journey
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yu Fengyuan
    On the 23rd at dusk, night enveloped the earth. The advance troops of the third batch of Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning home had been traveling since dawn, having walked fifty or sixty li with the Korean people seeing them off along the way. They began a memorable night camp in a certain place sixty or seventy li away from the boarding station.
    As soon as the advance troops arrived at the campsite, moving scenes of universal friendship and friendship everywhere immediately appeared in the villages where they were stationed. The troops on guard silently took up their posts. Officers greeted the soldiers. Under the slogan of "Horses not entering villages," the handlers orderly concentrated the army horses on the river滩 at the entrance of the village. Then, regardless of the fatigue of the march, the officers and soldiers rolled up their sleeves and launched a vigorous and enthusiastic friendship labor in the night camp villages. The fields at the village entrance were boiling with the laughter of officers and soldiers harvesting crops. On the threshing ground, the officers and soldiers sang loud songs while stripping corn kernels. The officers and soldiers also swept the courtyards clean for the landlords and filled the water tanks with water.
    At this time, the Korean people in the various stationed villages treated the night-camping Volunteer Army officers and soldiers as if they were welcoming relatives they had not seen for a long time. They vied to vacate their houses, some even whitewashing the houses, pasting white paper on the walls, and sprinkling "666" powder. When a certain unit of the advance troops arrived at a certain里 for a night camp, the members of the Qianji Agricultural Cooperative fetched water for the troops to wash their faces, and some sent freshly picked chestnuts and freshly boiled, plump corn to the officers and soldiers. The male cooperative members carried a freshly slaughtered pig, and seven or eight female cooperative members sent one hundred and forty jin of cleanly washed cabbage. The Volunteer Army was very grateful for the deep friendship of the Korean people, but refused to accept this generous gift. The cooperative members took out菜刀 and cut the pork into pieces on the spot, and also cut the vegetables, urging the officers and soldiers to cook, saying, "You have lived in Korea for eight years and have helped us with everything. Why do you always refuse to eat our things? This is the last time, and you must eat it this time!" Unable to refuse the kindness, the officers and soldiers had to accept it.
    At 19:30, the male and female cooperative members who had returned from the fields joyfully entered the threshing ground, beating long drums. They invited the officers and soldiers who were working on the ground to dance in a joyous get-together. The People's Army stationed nearby also came to sing and dance together. In this boiling mountain village, songs broke through the night sky and echoed in the quiet valleys. People danced for a while, then sat down to strip corn together; after stripping for a while, they got up again to sing and dance, until late at night.

    志愿军归国部队夜营特写
    凯旋途中处处友谊歌声
    新华社记者  于逢源
    23日黄昏，夜幕笼罩了大地。中国人民志愿军第三批归国部队先头部队官兵们从清晨离开驻地，在沿途朝鲜人民依依相送下已经走了五、六十里路，在距登车站还有六、七十里路的某地开始了难忘的夜营生活。
    先头部队一到宿营地，设营的各个村庄里立即出现了人人友谊、处处友谊的动人景象。担任警戒的部队静悄悄地走上了哨位。军官们向士兵们进行了问候。驭手们在“马不进村庄”的口号下，井然有序地把军马集中在村头的河滩里。接着，官兵们不顾行军劳累，纷纷卷起衣袖，在夜营村庄展开了热火朝天的友谊劳动。村头田野里沸腾着官兵们收割庄稼的喜笑声。打谷场上，官兵们一面剥脱玉米粒，一面唱起嘹喨的歌声。官兵们还为房东家里扫干净了院子，水缸里挑满了水。
    这时，各个设营村庄的朝鲜人民，更像款待久别重逢的亲人般地接待着夜营的志愿军官兵。他们争相腾出自己的房子，有的还把房子粉刷一新，墙壁上糊了白纸，撒了“六六六”粉。先头部队某部到达某里夜营时，钱积农业社的社员们有的给部队打来洗脸水，有的把刚摘下的新鲜栗子和刚煮熟的肥嫩的玉米，送到官兵们手里。男社员们抬来刚杀好的一口猪，七、八个女社员送来洗得干干净净的一百四十斤白菜。志愿军十分感谢朝鲜人民的深情友谊，但是无论如何不肯接受这份厚礼。社员们拿出菜刀一面把猪肉当场砍成几块，把菜也切了出来，催促官兵们做菜，一面说：“你们在朝鲜住了八年，什么事都帮助我们做，为什么老是不吃我们的东西，这是最后一次了，这次不吃可不行！”盛意难却，官兵们只好收下来。
    十九时三十分，从田野里归来的男女社员们喜洋洋地敲着长鼓涌进了打谷场，他们邀请正在场上劳动的官兵一起尽情地跳起了联欢舞，驻在附近的人民军也赶来同歌共舞。在这沸腾的山村里，歌声冲破了夜空，回荡在幽静的山谷中。人们跳一会舞，又坐下来一起剥玉米；剥一会，又起来歌舞联欢，直到深夜。
