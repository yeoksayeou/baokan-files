    Fiberglass Yacht "Dongfeng No. 1"
    Huang Yanpei
    Faint sea clouds, a short voyage, the sound of the engine pattering. How fast! And how steady! What are we sitting on? Someone on the boat told me: it's a specially made fiberglass yacht. Its weight is only a quarter of that of steel. It is so light, but its hardness is particularly high; even bullets cannot penetrate it. It has a particularly large buoyancy, and it can travel fifteen nautical miles per hour.
    Qinhuangdao and Yaohua Factory, using practical actions, are responding to technological innovation. It is the crystallization of labor and technological collaboration, and it is another brand-new product of 1958.

    玻璃钢游艇“东风一号”
    黄炎培淡淡的海云，短短的行程，拍拍的机声。多么快！又多么稳！我们坐着的是什么呢？船上的人告我：是特制的玻璃钢游
  艇。它的重量只有钢的四
  分之一。质那么轻，但硬度特别高，虽子弹也打不进。它浮力特别大，一小时能行十五海里
  路程。  秦皇岛、耀华厂，用实际行动，来响应技术革新。是劳动和技术协作的结晶，是1958年又一崭新的产品。
