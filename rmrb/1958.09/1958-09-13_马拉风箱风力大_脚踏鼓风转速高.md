Our newspaper, Hohhot, 12th -- A type of animal-powered wooden blower has recently been successfully trial-produced in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This is an important contribution to the current indigenous iron smelting efforts.

The first wooden blower, made by the Baotou City Wood Factory, does not use any steel. It uses wooden gears to rotate, driving two ordinary blacksmith's bellows to generate wind. It is powered by one horse and produces ten cubic meters of air per minute, which can supply a three-cubic-meter-volume iron smelting furnace. If the size of the bellows is increased and powered by two or three horses, it can supply the required airflow for a five-to-eight-cubic-meter small blast furnace. This type of blower can be manufactured by ordinary carpenters.

Our newspaper reports that Chen Xiang and Zhang Long, workers at the Guanghai Farm Implement Factory in Taishan, Guangdong Province, have successfully created a foot-powered blower.

This blower is very light and only requires one person to pedal, but it generates more than two or three horsepower. It has a very high speed, reaching one thousand three hundred to one thousand five hundred revolutions per minute. Based on its capacity, it can supply a pig iron smelter producing around 1.5 tons per day. The wooden wheel of this blower does not require belt traction; it can be driven with an ordinary hemp rope (about the thickness of a calligraphy brush handle).

    马拉风箱风力大
    脚踏鼓风转速高
    本报呼和浩特12日电　一种兽力木制鼓风机，最近在内蒙古自治区试制成功。这对目前土法炼铁是一项重要贡献。
    由包头市木器厂制成的第一台木制鼓风机，不用钢材，它用木齿轮转动，带动两个普通打铁用的风箱鼓风，用一匹马拉动，每分钟产生十立方公尺的风量，可以供给容积为三立方公尺的炼铁炉使用。如将风箱尺寸加大，用两匹马或三匹马拉动，就能供给五立方公尺到八立方公尺小高炉需要的风量。这种鼓风机，普通木匠也能制造。
    本报讯　广东省台山广海农具厂职工陈祥和张龙二人创造成功一台脚踏鼓风机。
    这个鼓风机很轻便，只需一个人来踏，但是它产生的能力有两三马力以上。它的转速很高，每分钟达一千三百到一千五百转。按它的能力可以供给日产一吨半左右的炼铁炉使用。这个鼓风机的木轮不需要皮带牵动，只要一条普通的（有毛笔杆子粗）麻绳就可带以动。
