Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 21st: According to TASS, Moscow, September 21st: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" today published Khrushchev's opinion paper, approved by the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, on strengthening the connection between school and life and further developing the Soviet national education system.

Khrushchev said that in the forty years of Soviet power, Soviet secondary and higher education have made tremendous achievements. Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet ten-year school currently does not solve the task of cultivating young people to go to life, but only cultivates young people to enter institutions of higher learning. Khrushchev emphasized that the task of Soviet schools should not only be to cultivate generalists who are proficient in the basics of science, but also to cultivate people who can consistently participate in physical labor. Khrushchev pointed out that all students should participate in public labor in factories and collective farms without exception after completing the seventh or eighth grade.

Khrushchev suggested dividing Soviet secondary education into two stages. The first stage is a seven-year or eight-year school, and this stage of education is compulsory for everyone. The second stage is two to three years of vocational education, which is carried out with differences between urban and rural areas.

In his opinion paper, Khrushchev believes that there can be another way for young people who have completed eight years of education in school to further their studies, that is, to participate in production and study at the same time in vocational training classes.

Khrushchev believes that it is appropriate to regard young people's part-time night school studies and correspondence studies as the second stage of secondary education. He pointed out that it is necessary to avoid the phenomenon that night schools believe that their task is simply to train students to enter institutions of higher learning. Students in these schools should deepen their professional knowledge while obtaining a general secondary education. Therefore, it is necessary to start cultivating talents for production and public labor in schools.

He suggested giving preferential treatment to worker and peasant youth students in schools who can well combine study with production work. He emphasized that the widespread development of night schools and correspondence school networks will give everyone who wants to study the opportunity to receive a complete secondary education. Then comes higher education.

Khrushchev pointed out that in order to realize the proposed reorganization, a transition period of three to four years is needed, during which a certain number of the current ten-year middle schools must be retained.

Khrushchev pointed out that many young people who graduate from universities now have very poor practical knowledge and insufficient training to participate in production work. He suggested reorganizing Soviet higher education, reforming the higher education system, bringing it closer to production, and truly combining it with production. The opinion paper suggests that institutions of higher learning should enroll young people who have life experience, have done a certain amount of practical work, and have shown talent and hope to continue their studies.

Khrushchev emphasized that the development of Soviet institutions of higher learning should especially follow the path of developing night schools and correspondence schools. He believes that in most institutions of higher learning, students' studies in the first two or three years should be part-time. Starting from the third grade, university students should have two or three days a week off from production, and only in the last two academic years can university students study full-time, except for the time necessary for production internships.

Khrushchev also suggested resuming the work of establishing factory universities and establishing schools attached to various enterprises and large farms.

Khrushchev suggested that the suggestions he put forward in the opinion paper be widely discussed in the Soviet system and the Party system, as well as in newspapers. The specific decisions on the reorganization of schools will be finally made by the Supreme Soviet conferences of the various republics.

    加强学校同生活的联系
    赫鲁晓夫建议改革苏联教育制度
    每个青年受完八年制教育必须参加生产
    高等教育应当着重发展夜校和函授学校
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：苏联“真理报”今天发表了苏共中央主席团批准的赫鲁晓夫关于加强学校同生活的联系和进一步发展苏联国民教育制度的意见书。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在苏维埃政权四十年来，苏联的中等教育和高等教育都取得了巨大的成就。赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联十年制学校目前不解决培养青年走向生活的任务，而只培养青年进入高等学校。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏联学校的任务不仅应该是培养谙熟科学基础的通才，而且还要培养能够一贯参加体力劳动的人。赫鲁晓夫指出，应当使全体学生读完七年级或八年级后无例外地都参加工厂和集体农庄的公益劳动。
    赫鲁晓夫建议把苏联中等教育分为两个阶段。第一阶段是七年制或八年制学校，这一阶段教育是全体都应受的义务教育。第二阶段是二年至三年的职业教育，城乡有区别地进行。
    赫鲁晓夫在意见书中认为，在学校受完八年制教育的青年进一步学习也可以有另一途径，即参加生产、同时在职业训练班进行学习。
    赫鲁晓夫认为，把青年不脱产的夜校学习和函授学习作为中等教育的第二阶段是适宜的。他指出，必须避免夜校认为自己的任务单单是为高等学校培养入学学生这种现象。这些学校中的学生在获得一般中等教育的同时，应当在他们的职业知识方面进行深造。因此，必须在学校中就开始为生产、为公益劳动培养人材。
    他建议给学校中那些能很好地使学习结合生产工作的工农青年学生以优待。他强调说，夜校和函授学校网的广泛发展将使一切愿意学习的人都有机会受到完整的中等教育。然后是高等教育。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，为了实现所建议的改组，需要有三、四年的过渡时期，在这段期间必需保留一定数量的目前这种十年制中学。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，现在许多大学毕业的青年，实践知识修养很差，参加生产工作的训练不足。他建议改组苏联高等教育，改革高等教育的系统，使它接近生产，并真正同生产相结合。意见书中建议高等学校招收已经有生活经验、做过一定的实际工作、表现有才能和希望继续升学的青年去学习。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，发展苏联的高等学校特别应当走发展夜校和函授学校的路线。他认为，在大多数高等学校里，学生头二三年的学习应当是不脱产的。从三年级开始，大学生每周应当有二三天不参加生产，只有到了最后两个学年，除了生产实习所必需的时间之外，大学生才可以完全脱产学习。
    赫鲁晓夫还建议恢复建立工厂大学的工作，在各企业和大农场附设学校。
    赫鲁晓夫建议把他在意见书里提出的建议拿到苏维埃系统和党的系统以及在报章上广泛地进行讨论。改组学校的具体决议最后将由各加盟共和国最高苏维埃会议作出。
