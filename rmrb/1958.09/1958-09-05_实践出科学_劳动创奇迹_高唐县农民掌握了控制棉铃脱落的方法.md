Practice Yields Science, Labor Creates Miracles
Gaotang County Farmers Master Method to Control Cotton Boll Shedding

(Our dispatch) Reporter Hu Lei reports: When Chairman Mao inspected Shandong in early August, he showed particular concern for the issue of cotton boll shedding and tasked the farmers and scientists with finding a way to prevent or reduce cotton boll shedding. Now, the farmers of Gaotang County, Shandong Province, have found a solution to drastically reduce cotton boll shedding, reducing the county's cotton boll shedding rate by more than 60% compared to the same period last year.

Preserving the cotton bolls so that each boll develops into a cotton peach is key to ensuring a bumper cotton harvest. In the past, the local cotton boll shedding rate generally reached over 70%, and in many cases, as high as 90%. This year, thanks to a series of effective measures taken by cotton farmers in Gaotang County, the county's cotton boll shedding rate has fallen to 30%, and in some cases, as low as 10%. One hundred cotton plants tested by the Hongwei People's Commune have not shed a single cotton boll to date. This fact has shattered the old theory held by scientists that a 25% reasonable shedding rate is normal.

This experience was jointly created by the Gaotang County Yinji Township Agricultural Science Research Station and the agricultural Red and Expert University students from Yinji and Jiangdian Townships. According to their research, the causes of boll shedding are primarily water damage, which prevents the cotton from being properly fertilized. Summer is rainy, and if rainwater enters the corolla when the flowers are in full bloom, the pollen is damaged, which affects fertilization. Their prevention method is to tie the corolla with thread before the flower blooms to prevent rainwater from entering. The result is that the boll preservation effect is almost 100%.

The second cause of boll shedding is the influence of residual flowers. Residual cotton flowers have no function after three days, and if they are not removed, the water-soaked residual flowers will rot easily, which will affect the decay of the young bolls and cause them to fall off. At the same time, residual flowers also restrict the growth of young bolls. Residual flowers are like a headache band; removing them can greatly promote cotton peach growth.

The third cause is poor ventilation and light. This year, cotton branches and leaves are particularly lush, and insufficient sunlight and air can easily cause boll shedding. On the one hand, they prune the branches and shoots, removing the old and ineffective leaves in the middle and lower parts of the cotton plants to promote ventilation and light; on the other hand, they use ropes or bamboo poles to pull the plants and ridge the extra tall satellite fields and high-yield fields, merging the two ridges together to create a ventilation channel, so that sunlight can directly shine on the ground and the entire cotton plant. The ridges are rotated every three to five days, so that each ridge of cotton plants can get sufficient sunlight and air. In large areas of cotton fields, the method of cross-merging ridges of cotton plants is also adopted, and the effect is also very good.

The fourth cause is soil compaction. After rain, the ground hardens, and water vapor rising from the ground increases the ground temperature, causing the cotton bolls to fall off. This year, they broke the conservative idea of "hang up the hoe after autumn begins" and "hoe the cotton eight times, the cotton peach will grow into an egg," and greatly increased the number of times of inter-tillage. Some cotton fields have now been hoed more than a dozen times. According to experimental observations at the Yinji Township Agricultural Science Research Station, the boll shedding rate was only 5% in the five days after hoeing after rain, and 12% without hoeing.

The fifth cause is insufficient fertilizer. The solution is to increase fertilization and apply fertilizer rationally. After mid-July, rainfall increased, and the cotton grew rapidly, requiring continuous fertilization. At the same time, the cotton plants are now tall, with peaches in the lower part, young bolls in the middle, and fruit branches growing, flowering, and budding in the upper part. Therefore, it is necessary to apply more phosphate fertilizer and nitrogen fertilizer. The farmers have mastered this characteristic and apply fertilizer every seven or eight days, carefully formulating the composition of the fertilizer so that it can both protect the peaches and promote continued growth in the upper part.

The sixth cause is pests. The Hongwei People's Commune and the Luwei Agricultural Cooperative in Yinji Township have both treated pests more than fifteen times, and have promptly sprayed pesticides to kill pests such as red spiders, cotton bollworms, and blind bugs in the later stages.

According to experiments conducted by the Yinji Township Agricultural Science Research Station, applying the plant growth stimulant – naphthalene acetic acid – to the boll stalks can also prevent cotton boll shedding. The actual results achieved by adopting the above comprehensive management methods have further increased the confidence of the vast number of cadres and the masses in increasing production. Cao Heguang, director of the cotton department of the Yinji Township Agricultural Red and Expert University, said: These methods were summarized in gradual exploration and experimentation, so this year there is still about 30% of the bud and boll shedding in general cotton fields. If this had been done from the beginning, it could have been guaranteed that the cotton boll shedding rate would be greatly reduced.

### 实践出科学　劳动创奇迹  高唐县农民掌握了控制棉铃脱落的方法

　　实践出科学　劳动创奇迹
    高唐县农民掌握了控制棉铃脱落的方法
    本报讯　记者胡雷报道：毛主席8月上旬到山东视察时，对棉铃脱落问题特别关心，曾向农民和科学家们提出了一个任务：如何使棉铃不脱落或少脱落。现在山东省高唐县的农民们已经找到了解决棉铃大量脱落的方法，使全县棉铃脱落率比去年同期减少60％以上。
    保住了棉铃，使个个棉铃都结成棉桃，是保证棉花丰收的重要关键。往年当地棉铃脱落率一般都达到70％以上，多者达到90％。今年高唐县棉农由于采取了一系列的有效措施，全县棉铃脱落率已下降到30％，有的下降到10％；宏伟人民公社试验的一百株棉花，至今一个棉铃也没有脱落。这个事实已经打破了过去科学家们认为棉铃有25％的合理脱落的陈旧理论。
    这个经验是高唐县尹集乡农业科学研究站以及尹集、姜店两个乡的农业红专大学学员们共同创造的。据他们研究造成落铃的原因，首先是雨水破坏，使棉花不能正常受精。夏季多雨，花朵盛开时如雨水浸入花冠，花粉受到破坏便影响受精。他们防治的办法是：在未开花前用扎线的办法封闭花冠，使雨水不能浸入花冠。这样做的结果，保铃效果几乎达到100％。
    落铃的第二个原因是残花的影响。棉花的残花在三天后即无作用，如不摘去，浸过水的残花发生腐烂，便容易影响幼铃腐烂而脱落；同时残花还束缚幼铃生长。残花好比头疼箍，摘去残花可以大大促进棉桃生长。
    第三个原因是通风透光不好。今年棉花枝叶特别茂密，阳光空气不足便容易引起落铃。他们一方面整枝打杈，打去棉株中下部不起作用的老叶，促其通风透光；另一方面将生长特别高大的卫星田、丰产田用绳子或竹竿拉株并垅，把两垅并在一起，闪出一条通风道，使阳光直晒到地面和棉株全身，隔三、五天轮换并垅一次，使每垅棉株都能得到充足的阳光和空气。在大面积棉田里，则采取棉株相互交叉并垅的办法，效果也很好。
    第四个原因是土壤板结。雨后地面板结，地层上升的水蒸气使地温增高，致使棉铃脱落。今年他们打破了“立了秋挂锄钩”，“棉花锄八遍，棉桃长成蛋”的保守思想，大大增加了中耕的次数，现在有的棉田已锄了十几遍。根据尹集乡农业科学研究站的试验观察，下雨后锄地的五天仅脱铃5％，不锄地的脱铃12％。
    第五个原因是肥料不足。解决办法是增施肥料，合理追肥。在7月中旬以后，雨量增多，棉花猛长，需要不断追肥。同时，现在棉株高大，下部是成桃，中部是幼铃，上部又要增长果枝，开花现蕾，因此，既要多施磷肥，又要增施氮肥。农民们掌握了这个特性，每隔七、八天追施一次肥，把肥料的成分调配好，既可保桃，又可促进上部继续生长。
    第六个原因是虫害。宏伟人民公社和尹集乡鲁伟农业社都已治虫十五次以上，对后期的红蜘蛛、棉铃虫、盲椿象等虫害，都及时用药剂喷杀。
    据尹集乡农业科学研究站试验，将植物生长刺激素——萘乙酸涂抹在铃茎上，也能防止棉铃脱落。采取上述综合管理方法所收到的实际效果，进一步提高了广大干部和群众的增产信心。尹集乡农业红专大学棉花系主任曹和光说：这些办法是在逐渐摸索试验中总结起来的，因此今年一般棉田还有30％左右的蕾铃脱落，如果一开始就这样办，可以保证棉铃脱落率大大降低。
