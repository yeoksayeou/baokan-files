Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Telegram, September 4th: Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, Secretaries Wang Qian, Wei Heng, Chi Biqing, Zheng Lin, Zhu Weihua, Secretary-General Shi Jiyan, and Li Qi, First Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee, and other responsible comrades went to Houjiagou near the eastern mountains of Taiyuan suburbs to mine iron ore.

At 10:00 AM, as soon as they arrived at the construction site, they immediately began digging iron ore alongside the cadres and farmers already on the mountain. They also frequently asked those around them for knowledge on identifying ore and learned about the construction of blast furnaces in the Taiyuan suburbs. They labored for three and a half hours, digging up more than 5,000 catties of ore.

Shanxi Province has now launched a massive, province-wide mass ore-mining movement. Currently, more than 100,000 people in Taiyuan and other parts of the province have gone up the mountains to mine ore, and many county Party secretaries have personally gone to the front lines to participate in ore digging. Jinan and Changzhi regions have launched an ore-mining campaign to "break down county boundaries and go wherever there is ore."

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang Telegram: In the Zunyi region of Guizhou Province, the Party committees at the district, county, regional, and township levels are vigorously establishing "Secretary Furnaces." Deputy secretaries who were originally in charge of industry have all learned to smelt iron in indigenous blast furnaces. First secretaries who were not specifically in charge of industry have now also gone to the blast furnaces. Their establishment of "Secretary Furnaces" has played a significant role in resolving key technical issues in smelting and liberating the thinking of veteran furnace masters and the masses.

As early as June, the Zunyi Regional Party Committee designated Deputy Secretary Chen Bin to take the lead, guiding several county and district Party secretaries and more than 20 technicians, indigenous furnace masters, and cadres to conduct experimental furnaces to solve key issues such as training personnel and smelting iron with anthracite coal. During the experimental process, Chen Bin personally operated, designed furnace types, and learned from the veteran furnace masters. When the experiment failed, he talked to the veteran furnace masters to liberate their thinking and encouraged them to think boldly and act boldly. Finally, at the end of July, he successfully smelted iron using anthracite coal. He also mastered the experience of organizing indigenous blast furnace production.

This experiment gave party organizations at all levels in the Zunyi region an insight: only by understanding production can we better organize and manage production. Entering August, "Secretary Furnaces" were established one after another, and deputy secretaries in charge of industry personally went to the front lines. In just over a month, they successively solved a series of key technical problems in iron smelting, such as smelting iron with anthracite coal, removing sulfur from coal, and eliminating nodules in the furnace. Now, all deputy secretaries and branch secretaries in charge of industry in the entire region have become experts in smelting iron in indigenous blast furnaces, and some can even give technical lectures on the stage. More importantly, they can guide the region's iron and steel production at any time based on their own experience.

### 山西省委书记采铁矿  遵义地区大办书记炉

　　山西省委书记采铁矿  遵义地区大办书记炉
    新华社太原电　4日，中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳，书记王谦、卫恒、池必卿、郑林、朱卫华，秘书长史纪言和中共太原市委第一书记李琦等负责同志，到太原市郊区东山侯家沟附近开采铁矿。
    上午十时，他们一到达工地，就立即同已上山的干部和农民一起紧张地刨挖铁矿，并不时向周围的人询问识别矿石的知识，了解太原郊区高炉的建设情况。他们一直劳动了三个半小时，共挖矿石五千多斤。
    山西省目前已经开展了一个声势浩大的全民采矿运动，现在太原市和全省各地已有十万多人上山采矿，许多县的党委书记亲临前线参加挖矿。晋南、长治地区开展了“打破县界，哪里有矿就到哪里去”的采矿活动。
    新华社贵阳电　贵州省遵义专区的中共地委、县委、区委和乡支部大办书记炉，原来分工管工业的副书记都学会了土高炉炼铁，原来没有具体管工业的第一书记现在也走上了高炉。他们办书记炉，对解决冶炼技术上的关键问题，解放老炉师和群众的思想等，都起到很大作用。
    早在6月份，中共遵义地委就指定副书记陈彬挂帅，带领几个县委、区委书记和二十多个技术员、土炉师和干部搞试验炉，解决培训人员和无烟煤炼铁等关键问题。在试验过程中，陈彬亲自操作，设计炉型，向老炉师们学习。试验失败，他就找老炉师们谈心，解放他们的思想，鼓励他们大胆想大胆干，终于在7月底用无烟煤炼铁成功。他也掌握了组织土高炉生产的经验。
    这一试验，给遵义专区各级党组织一个启示：只有懂得生产，才能更好地组织生产、管理生产。进入8月，各地书记炉便纷纷建立起来，管工业的副书记都亲临前线。在一个多月内，连续解决了用无烟煤炼铁、煤中去硫、消除炉内结瘤等炼铁生产中一系列技术上的关键问题。现在全专区所有管工业的副书记、支部书记都成了土高炉炼铁的内行，有的还能登台讲技术课。更重要的是他们能随时根据自己的经验指导全区的钢铁生产。
