Why is the US Army Still Lingering in Lebanon
Commentator of this newspaper

The new Lebanese President Chehab has been sworn in on September 23; the Chamoun regime, which served the US policy of aggression, has finally stepped down disgracefully. Chehab announced at his inauguration that his government would promote the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon. The downfall of Chamoun and Chehab's request for the withdrawal of US troops are a victory for the Lebanese people's struggle to safeguard national independence and another failure for the US policy of aggression.

A month ago, at the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the US aggressors were forced to accept the proposal of the Arab countries requesting the early withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan. Since then, in order to cope with world public opinion, the United States has withdrawn several battalions of troops from Lebanon, but the majority of the US troops occupying Lebanon are still lingering there. Not only that, but while withdrawing troops from Lebanon, the United States continues to increase its troops in the Middle East; the US occupying forces remaining in Lebanon are still engaged in large-scale construction, building barracks and bases, and actively preparing for the winter. In his speech at the 13th session of the UN General Assembly on September 18, US Secretary of State Dulles was also ambiguous about the withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon, making no clear statement, and once again made vicious attacks and slanders against Arab countries that adhere to national independence, vainly attempting to shift the blame for the tense situation in the Middle East onto others. These facts show that the United States is playing a double game, trying to evade the condemnation of world public opinion, doing its best to delay the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon, attempting to continue to threaten the Arab people, and maintaining the tense situation in the Middle East.

Dulles said at the United Nations General Assembly meeting that the current situation in the Middle East cannot yet make the United States "completely relieved." What is it that makes the United States unable to "rest assured"? Dulles once again rehashed the old tune of so-called "inflammatory propaganda broadcasts" by certain countries, insisting that this is a cause of the tense situation in the Middle East. The so-called certain countries here clearly refer to the United Arab Republic and Iraq, and other Arab countries that adhere to national independence. It is nothing new for US aggressors to make such unwarranted attacks and slanders against Arab countries. People still remember that before the armed invasion of Lebanon on July 15, the United States openly slandered the United Arab Republic for so-called "indirect aggression" against Lebanon; in his speech at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session on August 13, US President Eisenhower processed and reproduced the so-called "indirect aggression" lie, and put forward the so-called "inflammatory propaganda" argument. This slander and attack by the US aggressors against Arab countries has not only been exposed by facts, but also refuted by many countries at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session, and has completely gone bankrupt. However, despite this, in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly meeting, Dulles once again picked up this rag that is completely insufficient to cover shame, creating a completely unfounded excuse for the United States to delay its withdrawal of troops. Dulles's set of nonsense cannot achieve any other effect except to expose that the United States still adheres to its policy of aggression.

At the same time, the United States is also preparing that after it is forced to withdraw its troops from Lebanon, it will continue its military occupation of Lebanon in disguise under various guises. In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly meeting, Dulles once again demanded the establishment of a so-called "United Nations Peace Force" to "replace" the US and British troops and continue to occupy Lebanon and Jordan, and that is its true purpose. According to the logic of the United States, Arab countries seem destined to always be occupied by foreign troops; otherwise, it is not enough to "make people see the concern of the whole world for maintaining peace." Isn't this precisely the typical imperialist logic of aggression?

The US practice of delaying the withdrawal of its invading troops from Lebanon has aroused great indignation among the Arab people. In commenting on Dulles's speech on September 18, Cairo's "Al-Akhbar" pointed out that the resolution passed by the Emergency Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly is gradually becoming a dead letter. It seems that if Western countries want to go out the door, they will definitely plan to jump back in through the window. Therefore, the wisest policy that the Arab people should adopt towards the West is complete distrust. A commentary on "Voice of the Arabs" radio said that US and British imperialism is adopting a policy that is completely contrary to the resolution passed by the Emergency Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, and is creating various obstacles to obstruct the implementation of the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly.

More than a month has passed since the resolution of the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly was made, and now the President of Lebanon has also proposed to promote the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon. The aggressors have no reason to continue to stay there. The people of the world must unite with the Arab people and continue to fight to the end to force the US and British troops to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan and eliminate the tense situation in the Middle East.

    美国军队为什么还赖在黎巴嫩
    本报评论员
    新任黎巴嫩总统谢哈布已于9月23日宣誓就职；为美国侵略政策效劳的夏蒙政权终于可耻地下台了。谢哈布在就职典礼上宣布，他的政府将促使外国军队撤出黎巴嫩。夏蒙的下台和谢哈布要求美军撤退，这是黎巴嫩人民维护民族独立斗争的胜利，也是美国侵略政策的又一个失败。
    美国侵略者在一个月以前，在联合国大会紧急特别会议上，被迫接受了要求外国军队早日撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的阿拉伯国家的提案。在那以后美国为了应付世界舆论，曾从黎巴嫩撤走了几营军队，但是侵占黎巴嫩的大部分美军依然赖在那里不走。不仅如此，美国在从黎巴嫩撤军的同时，又向中东继续增加军队；留在黎巴嫩的美国侵略军队还在大兴土木、建筑营房和基地，积极进行过冬的准备工作。美国国务卿杜勒斯9月18日在联大十三届大会上的发言中，对于美军撤出黎巴嫩的问题，也含糊其辞，未作任何明确表示，而对坚持民族独立的阿拉伯国家，又一次进行了恶毒的攻击和污蔑，妄想把造成中东紧张局势的原因转嫁于人。这些事实说明，美国正在玩弄两面手法，妄想逃避世界舆论的谴责，尽力拖延从黎巴嫩撤军，力图继续威胁阿拉伯人民，并保持中近东的紧张局势。
    杜勒斯在联合国大会会议上，说什么目前中东局势还不能叫美国“完全放心”。到底是什么使美国不能“放心”呢？杜勒斯又重弹某些国家进行所谓“煽动性宣传广播”的滥调，硬说这是造成中东局势紧张的一个原因。这里所谓某些国家，显然指的是阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克等坚持民族独立的阿拉伯国家。美国侵略者对于阿拉伯国家进行这种无中生有的攻击和污蔑早已不是什么新鲜事了。人们都还记得，美国早在7月15日武装侵略黎巴嫩以前，就公开污蔑阿拉伯联合共和国对黎巴嫩进行所谓“间接侵略”；美国总统艾森豪威尔8月13日在联大紧急特别会议上的发言中，又把所谓“间接侵略”的谰言加工翻制，提出了所谓“煽动性宣传”的论调。美国侵略者对于阿拉伯国家的这种污蔑和攻击，不但早被事实所揭破，并且在联大紧急特别会议上受到许多国家的驳斥，而完全陷于破产。但是，尽管如此，杜勒斯在联合国大会会议上的发言中，又一次捡起了这块完全不足以遮羞的破布，为美国拖延撤军制造毫不足凭的借口。杜勒斯这套胡言乱语，除了暴露美国仍然坚持侵略政策以外，是不能得到任何其他的效果的。
    同时，美国还准备在迫不得已从黎巴嫩撤军以后，在这样那样的伪装下，变相地继续它对黎巴嫩实行军事占领。杜勒斯在联合国大会会议的发言中又一次要求建立所谓“联合国和平部队”来“代替”美英军队，继续占领黎巴嫩和约旦，其真正目的就在于此。按照美国的逻辑，阿拉伯国家似乎注定总是要被外国军队占领的，非如此，不足以“使人们看到全世界对于维持安宁的关心”。这难道不正是典型的帝国主义的侵略逻辑吗？
    美国拖延从黎巴嫩撤退它的侵略军队的作法，已经激起了阿拉伯人民的极大愤慨。开罗的“消息报”在评论杜勒斯9月18日的演说时指出，联合国大会紧急会议通过的决议正在逐渐变成一纸具文。看来，西方国家如果要从门口走出去的话，它必定打算从窗口再跳回来。因此，阿拉伯人民对西方所采取的最明智的政策应当是完全的不信任。“阿拉伯之声”电台的评论说，美英帝国主义正在采取同联合国大会紧急会议所通过的决议案完全背道而驰的方针，并且正在制造种种障碍来阻挠执行联合国大会的决议。
    联合国大会紧急特别会议的决议已经作出一个多月，现在黎巴嫩总统也提出了要促使外国军队撤出黎巴嫩，侵略者更没有任何理由继续留在那里了。全世界人民必须同阿拉伯人民一起，继续为迫使美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，消除中东紧张局势而斗争到底。
