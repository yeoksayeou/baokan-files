A Group of "Satellites" Soar into the Sky

    Corn – Yield of over 35,000 jin per mu
    Hemp – Yield of over 11,000 jin per mu
    Tea – Yield of over 1,600 jin per mu
    Sesame – Yield of over 2,000 jin per mu
    Millet – Yield of over 27,000 jin per mu
    Soybean – Yield of over 4,500 jin per mu

    Corn
    Xinhua News Agency: Wang Jixian, Party Branch Secretary of the Eighth Production Team of the Wanglou People's Commune in Shangqiu County, Henan Province, and Zhang Fahai, Secretary of the Third Branch, and others cultivated a 1.27 mu experimental cornfield that actually yielded 44,950 jin of corn, averaging more than 35,393 jin per mu. This "satellite" is more than 8,081 jin higher than the corn yield record of 27,312 jin per mu set by the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Huang County, Shandong Province.
    This high-yield experimental field was deep-plowed three times to a depth of three chi before sowing, with 100,000 jin of base fertilizer applied in layers, and harrowed four times. The seeds were a mixed planting of "Yellow Horse Tooth" and "Golden Queen." In field management, five applications of fertilizer and five irrigations were carried out, and weeding was done five times, with artificial pollination performed five times.
    During the harvesting process, in addition to two inspections and acceptances by the Shangqiu County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wang Lin, Deputy Secretary of the Shangqiu Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Ran Yi, Secretary-General of the Prefectural Committee, personally went to the site for inspection and acceptance.

    Hemp
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 16th: The Manshanhong Agricultural Cooperative in Meilin Township, Nan'an County, in the Fujian front-line area, launched a large hemp "satellite" with a yield of over "10,000 jin" per mu on the 14th. The members of this cooperative immediately reported the good news of creating the hemp "10,000 jin" great "satellite" to the soldiers on the front line. They told the front-line troops: "Our hemp great 'satellite' has soared into the sky! We are determined to use more hemp to support the front line and use hemp to make a noose to strangle the American wolf!" They also expressed their determination to create a "10,000 jin hemp cooperative" next year to support the People's Liberation Army in defeating the American aggressors and annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
    This 1.021 mu high-yield hemp field is the experimental field of the Communist Party Branch of the Manshanhong Agricultural Cooperative. On the afternoon of the 11th, Branch Secretary Chen Kaopao led 239 male and female cooperative members to harvest, which took a full two days to complete on the afternoon of the 13th. The actual yield of dry hemp was 11,656 jin and 2 liang, averaging more than 11,416 jin per mu.

    Tea
    Our newspaper reports: The Gaofeng Agricultural Cooperative in Huangbai Township, Chong'an County, Fujian Province, cultivated a 1.14 mu Shui Xian Yan tea plantation with an average yield of 1,635 jin and 15 liang per mu, breaking the national record of 1,412 jin per mu created by Qiukou Township in Wuyuan, Jiangxi Province. This tea garden was cultivated by Zhu Sihui, Party General Branch Secretary of Huangbai Township, and Wu Lanjin, Township Head, and others.

    Sesame
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: A 1.2 mu spring sesame field in the Zhongzhou People's Commune, Guanzhuang Township, Runan County, Henan Province, actually yielded 2,467 jin, averaging more than 2,055 jin and 13 liang per mu, which is more than ten times higher than the highest historical yield here.
    The sesame was harvested starting on August 20th and completed drying and threshing on September 1st.

    Millet
    Xinhua News Agency: Millet experimental fields in Shangqiu County, Henan Province, Fan County, Shandong Province, and Linzhang County, Hebei Province, have yields as high as 22,000 jin to 27,000 jin per mu.
    A 1.338 mu experimental field in the Songji People's Commune of Shangqiu County yielded 27,133 jin of millet per mu. A 1.3 mu experimental field in the Longwangzhuang Township People's Commune of Fan County yielded 23,611 jin of millet per mu. A 1.02 mu "satellite" field in the Hongguang People's Commune of Linzhang County yielded 22,412 jin of spring millet per mu. The high yields created by these three people's communes have all exceeded the record of 21,787 jin of millet per mu set by the Taiqian Agricultural Cooperative in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province. The millet in the Songji People's Commune of Shangqiu County, which had the highest yield, weighed an average of 6 liang and 6 qian per ear.
    The high-yield records created by these communes have all been inspected and verified by the provincial "satellite" acceptance team, the person in charge of the county party committee, and the secretary of the township party committee.

    Soybean
    Our newspaper reports: The Nan Guangming No. 2 Cooperative in Shuhe Township, Linyi, Shandong Province, planted 154.3 mu of spring soybeans. Harvesting has been completed, with an actual yield of more than 200,200 jin, averaging 1,314 jin and 12 liang per mu. In addition, there are more than 27 mu of "satellite" fields, with an average yield of 4,517 jin and 12 liang per mu. The soybean satellite fields were cultivated jointly by the cooperative's cadres, the youth technology team, and the county agricultural and forestry bureau work team. The main reasons for the high yield are: deep plowing to one chi last winter, harrowing the ground three times after thawing, and re-cultivating twice. Sowing was done during Qingming, using 14 to 16 jin of seeds per mu, and 36 jin for the satellite fields. The inspectors included Liu Huaichuan, Deputy Director of the County Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, Shao Yuju, Deputy Township Head, and more than 30 cooperative members. The acreage and yield have all been verified.

    一群“卫星”飞上天
    玉米——亩产三万五千多斤
    黄麻——亩产一万一千多斤
    茶叶——亩产一千六百多斤
    芝麻——亩产二千多斤
    谷子——亩产二万七千多斤

    玉米
    新华社讯　河南省商丘县王楼人民公社第八生产队党总支书记王继先、第三支部书记张发海等培育的一亩二分七厘玉米试验田，实收玉米四万四千九百五十斤，平均亩产三万五千三百九十三斤多。这颗“卫星”比山东省黄县光明农业社的玉米亩产纪录二万七千三百一十二斤还高出八千零八十一斤多。
    这块丰产试验田，在播种前共深翻了三次，达三尺深，分层施底肥十万斤，并耙了四遍。播种是“黄马牙”和“金皇后”混播。田间管理中，进行了五肥五水，前后锄草五次，人工授粉五次。
    收打过程中，除中共商丘县委组织有关部门两次验收外，中共商丘地委副书记王林、地委秘书长冉毅等又亲自到现场作了检查验收。
    黄麻
    据新华社福州16日电　福建前线地区南安县的美林乡满山红农业社，14日发出一颗亩产“万斤”以上的黄麻大“卫星”，这个社的社员们马上把创造黄麻“万斤”大“卫星”的事迹向前线将士报喜。他们向前线部队说：“我们黄麻大‘卫星’上天了，我们决心用更多的黄麻支援前线，用黄麻制成绞索勒死美国狼”。他们并表示明年决心创造“黄麻万斤社”，来支援解放军打败美国侵略者和歼灭蒋匪帮。
    这丘一点零二一亩黄麻丰产田是中共满山红农业社支部的试验田。11日下午，支部书记陈考炮带领二百三十九位男女社员进行收割，到13日下午整整用两天才收获完毕。实收干麻一万一千六百五十六斤二两，平均亩产一万一千四百十六斤多。
    茶叶

    芝麻
    据新华社郑州讯　河南省汝南县官庄乡中州人民公社一亩二分春芝麻，实收二千四百六十七斤，平均亩产二千零五十五斤十三两多，比这里历史上最高产量增高十倍多。
    这块芝麻8月20日开始收割，9月1日晒打完毕。
    谷子
    新华社讯　河南省商丘县、山东省范县、河北省临漳县的谷子试验田，亩产高达两万二千多斤到两万七千多斤。
    商丘县宋集人民公社一亩三分三厘八毫试验田，亩产谷子两万七千一百三十三斤。范县龙王庄乡人民公社一亩三分试验田，亩产谷子两万三千六百一十一斤。临漳县红光人民公社一点零二亩“卫星”田，亩产春谷两万二千四百一十二斤。这三个人民公社创造的高额产量，都超过了山东省寿张县台前农业社亩产谷子二万一千七百八十七斤的纪录。产量最高的商丘县宋集人民公社的谷子，每穗平均有六两六钱重。
    这些公社创造的丰产纪录，都经过所在省“卫星”验收组、县委负责人、乡党委书记等的验收和核实。
    大豆
    本报讯　山东临沂涑河乡南光明二社种春大豆一百五十四亩三分，目前已经收打完毕，实产二十万零二千多斤，平均亩产一千三百十四斤十二两。另有“卫星”田二十七亩多，平均亩产四千五百十七斤十二两。大豆卫星田是由该社社干部、青年技术组、县农林局工作组等共同培植的。丰产主要原因：去冬深翻一尺，开冻后顶凌耙地三遍，又复耕二遍。清明时播种，每亩用种子十四到十六斤。卫星田三十六斤。验收人有县农林局副局长刘怀川、副乡长邵玉菊等及社员三十余人。亩数产量均已核实。
