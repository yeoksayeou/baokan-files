Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 11th dispatch: The United States is using underhanded tactics to increase its invading troops in Lebanon. According to an announcement by the U.S. Department of the Navy on the evening of the 10th, a Marine Corps battalion stationed in Lebanon will begin withdrawing from Beirut on September 15th. However, at the same time, the United States will dispatch the Second Battalion of the Sixth Regiment of the Second Division from the mainland to the Mediterranean to join the Sixth Fleet. In addition, a company from the regimental headquarters will also be attached. The news stated that the total number of U.S. troops to be transferred to the Mediterranean is approximately 1,900, while the number of troops withdrawn from Lebanon is only 1,700. According to United Press International, the reason for adding an extra company is "to be utilized in case it is necessary to expand the Marine Corps forces in the Mediterranean."

    美国打算玩弄撤军把戏
    宣布将从黎巴嫩撤走一营但又增兵地中海
    据新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国用偷天换日的办法来增加它侵略黎巴嫩的军队。据美国海军部10日晚上宣布，美国驻在黎巴嫩的军队将有一个海军陆战队营从9月15日开始撤离贝鲁特。但同时美国将从本土派遣第二师第六团第二营到地中海参加第六舰队。另外还附加团总部的一个连。消息说，美国将调往地中海的部队一共约有一千九百人，而从黎巴嫩撤出的部队只有一千七百人。据合众国际社说，所以要加派一个连是“为了一旦有必要扩大地中海的海军陆战队兵力时可以加以利用”。
