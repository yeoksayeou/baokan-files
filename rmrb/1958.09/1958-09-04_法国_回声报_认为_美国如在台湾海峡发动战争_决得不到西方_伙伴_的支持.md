Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd. Paris: Several newspapers commented on the 1st that the United States' policy of creating tension in the Taiwan area has left it completely isolated.

    "Liberation" wrote: The United States' Western allies have formally stated that they do not approve of the United States' playing with fire in the Far East; therefore, the United States is now politically completely isolated in the Far East.
    "Les Echos," which represents the interests of French financial giants, believes that if the United States decides to launch a war in the Taiwan Strait, it will not receive the support of its allies in Europe or its allies in Asia. The newspaper believes that within the Atlantic group, the opposition taken by Canada and the United Kingdom is "very telling."
    "Combat" believes that the United States' actions in interfering in the internal affairs of the Chinese people "contain incalculable risks."

    法国“回声报”认为
　　美国如在台湾海峡发动战争
　　决得不到西方“伙伴”的支持
    新华社2日讯　巴黎不少报纸1日在评论中指出，美国在台湾地区制造紧张局势的政策已经使它自己陷于完全的孤立。
    “解放报”写道：美国的西方盟国已经正式表示它们不赞成美国在远东的玩火行为；因此美国目前在远东已经在政治上完全孤立。
    代表法国金融资本巨头利益的“回声报”认为，如果美国决定在台湾海峡发动战争，它将既得不到它在欧洲的盟国、也得不到它在亚洲的盟国的支持。这家报纸认为，在大西洋集团内，加拿大和英国所采取的反对态度是“很能说明征候的”。
    “战斗报”认为，美国干涉中国人民内政的行动“所包含的冒险是无法估计的”。
