Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th - Kopřiva, member of the Political Bureau of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee and Deputy Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia, stated in Prague on the 20th that we stand entirely with China. All imperialists should see that the socialist camp and the forces of peace are incomparably strong today. China has sufficient strength to drive the US imperialists out of its territory.

Kopřiva made these remarks while delivering a congratulatory speech at the Fourth Czechoslovak National Congress of Peace Defenders. When he said that the Czechoslovak people would do everything in their power to support the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate their territory of Taiwan, the whole audience erupted in warm applause.

In his speech, Kopřiva recalled the feelings of infinite joy that the Czechoslovak people experienced when the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. He said, however, that what the US imperialists feared most was that the Chinese people had stood up. On the one hand, they run thousands of kilometers away from their own territory to provoke in the Taiwan Strait, and on the other hand, they perversely describe the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate their territory as a new Munich. Kopřiva said that the Czechoslovak people were direct victims of Munich, and we will never allow US imperialism to carry out deceptive conspiracies.

    柯别茨基副总理表示
    捷人民全力支持中国
    新华社布拉格20日电捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央政治局委员、捷克斯洛伐克副总理柯别茨基20日在布拉格说，我们完全同中国站在一起。所有帝国主义者都应当看到今天社会主义阵营与和平力量是无比强大的。中国有足够的力量把美帝国主义者从自己的领土上赶出去。
    柯别茨基是在捷克斯洛伐克第四次全国和平保卫者代表大会上致贺词时说这番话的。当他说到捷克斯洛伐克人民要尽一切力量支持中国人民解放自己领土台湾的正义斗争时，全场响起了热烈的掌声。
    柯别茨基在讲话中回顾了捷克斯洛伐克人民在1949年中华人民共和国成立时那种无限欢欣鼓舞的心情。他说，但是，美帝国主义者最害怕的就是中国人民站起来了。他们一方面跑到离本国领土几千公里外的台湾海峡去挑衅，另一方面却还颠倒黑白地把中国人民解放自己领土的正义斗争说成是新的慕尼黑。柯别茨基说，捷克斯洛伐克人民是慕尼黑的直接受害者，我们决不允许美帝国主义进行欺骗的阴谋活动。
