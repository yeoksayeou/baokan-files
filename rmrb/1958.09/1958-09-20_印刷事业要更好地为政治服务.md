Since liberation, newspaper and book printing work has made great achievements. Not only has printing productivity greatly developed, but the printing quality has also greatly surpassed that before liberation. Printing workers have basically realized the requirements of the Party and the government for printing work, and have created many good experiences. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, printing workers have mustered their energy and done many things they did not dare to think of in the past. Publications that used to be printed in one or two months to coordinate with political movements and production can now be published in a few hours, a day, or two or three days, and this is not an isolated example of individual places or printing factories.

In order to implement the Party's general line for building socialism and to meet the needs of the cultural and technological revolutions, printing work should serve the Great Leap Forward in industry, agriculture, culture, and education on a larger scale, more rapidly, and more effectively. To this end, printing work is required to solve two key problems in a timely manner: one is to further clarify the nature and guidelines of newspaper and book printing work, and the other is to establish a national printing network from the central government to the county level. Through repeated discussions, this national newspaper and book printing work conference has reached a consensus on these two key issues and has made plans for the construction of the printing network.

Whom does newspaper and book printing work ultimately serve? This is the first issue that the conference focused on debating. Everyone unanimously recognized that newspaper and book printing work is a link in the entire newspaper and book publishing process and must serve politics. This policy is determined by the nature of newspaper and book printing work. Newspaper and book printing work is an industry that publishes various kinds of reading materials through this industry. This industry is an important weapon in publishing work that conducts socialist education and disseminates scientific and cultural knowledge. Therefore, printing work has great political significance in the cause of socialist construction, and it must serve the entire socialist publishing cause and the overall socialist construction cause. Ignoring this political significance, or not understanding the purpose of one's work, will lead to a loss of direction in work, printing for the sake of printing, and even being captured by bourgeois management ideas. Some people believe that there is an insurmountable contradiction between political tasks and economic indicators, and that emphasizing political tasks will inevitably affect the completion of economic indicators. These are all manifestations of bourgeois management thinking. They do not understand that the political tasks and economic indicators of printing work are generally compatible. The better the service to politics, the better the economic indicators will be completed. Of course, some temporary and local difficulties may also arise in actual work. As long as we clarify that economic tasks are subordinate to political tasks, rely on the leadership of the Party, mobilize the masses, and try every means to find ways to improve our work, the contradictions will be readily solved.

At the recently held national newspaper and book printing work conference, a bold slogan was put forward for the establishment of a national printing network, that is, to work hard for three years to establish a national newspaper and book printing network from the central government to the county level, with large, medium, and small enterprises coexisting, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, so that publications in provinces, special districts, and counties can be printed locally in the future, and provinces can print high-quality books and newspapers, and counties can typeset and print their own publications. This is an important and urgent task. Printing is the material foundation of publishing work. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the deepening and development of the cultural and technological revolutions, the variety and circulation of books, magazines, and newspapers have increased rapidly. Therefore, there has been a temporary shortage in the supply of printing productivity, which has affected the smooth progress of publishing work. If plans are not made early, this contradiction between the supply and demand of printing productivity will further expand. Our country is so vast, and the local printing industry, especially at the special district and county levels, is relatively weak. It is a daunting task to build such a printing network in three years. However, as long as we implement the Party's general line for building socialism, strengthen the Party's leadership, give play to the spirit of communist cooperation, and advocate that everyone should run printing, rather than a few people, the goal of establishing a national printing network can be fully realized. There is no doubt that the role of large factories cannot be ignored in the work of building a printing network, and they must play a supporting and backbone role; however, in the future, more attention should be paid to running medium and small factories in order to meet the needs of the publishing industry in a shorter period of time. To build such a printing network, a large number of printing machines are needed, and most of them should be made using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, relying on provinces and cities to manufacture them independently, so that results can be achieved in the shortest possible time. Of course, support and cooperation are also important guarantees for the completion of the national printing network. Since 1956, Shanghai has transferred machinery and equipment to various provinces and cities, with a production capacity of more than 700,000 reams, and 700 workers, which has strongly supported various provinces and cities. At this meeting, it was proposed to provide dozens more machines to support various regions, and Beijing also tried every means to tap its potential and provide support to various regions. The Zhangjiakou Daily used its machinery and equipment to strongly support the eight counties under the jurisdiction of the special district, enabling 14 of the 16 counties in the special district to print county newspapers. This communist spirit is worthy of great promotion.

To successfully solve the two important tasks unanimously confirmed by the conference, namely, clarifying the policy and establishing a national printing network, the key lies in putting politics in command and breaking down superstitions. Whether printing can serve politics is essentially a matter of putting politics in command, and a matter of position and viewpoint. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over printing work, strengthen political and ideological work in the printing industry, remove all kinds of white flags such as purely economic viewpoints and departmentalism, and plant the red flag of serving politics. At the same time, it is also necessary to break down superstitions. If dogmatism, empiricism, and mysterious views in printing work are not broken, we cannot better serve politics and cannot establish a national printing network in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. This national newspaper and book printing work conference is a conference that puts politics in command and breaks down superstitions. By implementing the spirit of this conference and working hard for a period of time, the printing work in our country will surely show a new look and play a powerful coordinating role in the entire technological and cultural revolutions.

### 印刷事业要更好地为政治服务

    印刷事业要更好地为政治服务
    解放以来，报纸书刊印刷工作成绩很大，不仅印刷生产力有了很大的发展，在印刷质量上也大大超过了解放以前；印刷工作者基本上实现了党和政府对印刷工作的要求，创造了许多很好的经验。特别是大跃进以来，印刷工作者鼓足干劲，做了许多过去所不敢想的事情。一般配合政治运动和配合生产的出版物，过去要印一个月两个月的，现在都能在几小时、一天或两三天内出版，而且不是个别地方个别印刷厂的事例。
    为了贯彻党的建设社会主义总路线，适应文化革命技术革命的需要，印刷工作要更大规模，更迅速，更有效地为工业、农业、文化教育事业的大跃进服务。为此，要求印刷工作及时解决两个关键性的问题，一个是进一步明确报纸书刊印刷工作的性质和方针，一个是建立全国的从中央到县的印刷网。这次全国报纸书刊印刷工作会议通过反复的讨论，对这两个关键性的问题都有了一致的认识，并对印刷网的建设作了规划。
    报纸书刊印刷工作究竟为谁服务？这是这个会议首先集中争辩的问题。大家一致明确认识：报纸书刊印刷工作是整个报纸书刊出版过程中的一个环节，必须为政治服务。这条方针是由报纸书刊印刷工作的性质所决定的。报纸书刊印刷工作是一种工业，通过这种工业出版各种各样的读物，这种工业是进行社会主义教育和传播科学文化知识的出版工作中的重要的武器。因此，印刷工作，在社会主义建设事业中具有重大的政治意义，它必须为整个的社会主义的出版事业和总的社会主义建设事业服务。忽视这种政治意义，或者不了解自己工作的目的，就会使工作迷失方向，为印刷而印刷，甚至会被资产阶级经营思想所俘虏。有人认为，政治任务和经济指标之间存在着不可克服的矛盾，强调政治任务，必然影响经济指标的完成。这些都是资产阶级经营思想的表现。他们不了解：印刷工作的政治任务和经济指标一般地说是相适应的，为政治服务得越好，经济指标也会完成得越好。当然也可能在实际工作中出现一些暂时的和局部的困难，只要明确经济任务服从于政治任务，依靠党的领导，发动群众，千方百计地想办法找窍门改进工作，矛盾就会迎刃而解。
    在最近举行的全国报纸书刊印刷工作会议上，对于建立全国印刷网提出了一个豪迈的口号，即苦战三年，建立一个从中央到县的、大中小并举的、土洋结合的全国报纸书刊印刷网，使省、专区、县的出版物今后都能够就地印刷，省省都能印质量较高的书报，县县都能排印自己的出版物。这是一个重要而又紧迫的任务。印刷是出版工作的物质基础，自从大跃进以来，随着文化革命和技术革命的深入和发展，书籍、杂志和报纸的品种和发行量都增加得很快，因而在印刷生产力的供应方面，暂时出现了紧张的情况，影响了出版工作的顺利进行。如不及早筹划，这种印刷生产力供需之间的矛盾，还将更加扩大。我国地方这样辽阔，地方印刷工业，在专区和县两级基础又比较薄弱，要在三年内建成这样的印刷网，任务是艰巨的。但是，只要贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，加强党的领导，发挥共产主义协作精神，提倡大家来办印刷，而不是少数人办印刷，建立全国印刷网的目标是完全可以实现的。毫无疑问，在建设印刷网的工作中，大型工厂的作用不可忽视，它要起支援作用和骨干作用；但是今后更要注意办中小型厂，才能在较短时间内满足出版事业的需要。建设这样的一个印刷网，要有大量的印刷机器，大部分要采取土洋结合的办法，依靠各省市自力制造，然后才能在最短时间内取得成效。当然，支援和协作，也是建成全国印刷网的重要保证。上海1956年以来外调各省市的机器设备，其生产能力达七十余万令，工人有七百人，大力支援了各省市。这次会上又提出好几十台机器支援各地，北京也千方百计挖掘潜力，对各地进行了支援。张家口日报社用机器设备大力支援了专区所属的八个县，使专区十六个县中的十四个县都能印县报，这种共产主义的精神值得大大提倡。
    要胜利地解决会议所一致确认的两个重要任务，即明确方针和建立全国印刷网，关键在于政治挂帅和破除迷信。印刷能否为政治服务，实质上是一个政治挂帅问题，是一个立场观点问题。因此必须加强党对印刷工作的领导，加强印刷事业中的政治思想工作，拔掉单纯经济观点和本位主义等形形色色的白旗，插上为政治服务的红旗。同时也要破除迷信。印刷工作中的教条主义、经验主义、神秘观点，这种种迷信不打破，就不能更好地为政治服务，不能又多又快又好又省地建立全国印刷网。这次全国报纸书刊印刷工作会议就是一个政治挂帅、打破迷信的会议。贯彻这个会议的精神，苦战一个时期，我国印刷工作就一定会出现一个崭新的面貌，对整个技术革命和文化革命起到有力的配合作用。
