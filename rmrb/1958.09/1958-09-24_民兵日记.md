Militiaman's Diary
Yan Yizhong, Worker at Shijingshan Power Plant

I shouldered my rifle and became a glorious militiaman. Everyone looked at me with eyes of both joy and envy, saying, "How impressive!" I held my head high, deliberately shaking the rifle on my shoulder...

I carefully stroked my black, shiny, and heavy little rifle. On the day the gun was issued, I fired the first shot with great curiosity. Just as I was feeling happy, our company commander sternly criticized me, saying, "That won't do! A soldier should act like a soldier; no random firing!" My face flushed with embarrassment, and I said, "I don't understand, can you tell me about it?" He skillfully took the gun, looked at it a couple of times, and said, "There will be more training later, let me tell you a little about it now. I used this type of rifle before; it's an American-made 30 rifle, delivered to us by Chiang Kai-shek's Transportation Corps. It has an effective range of 2,700 meters. Later, when we are well-trained, we will get even better ones." I thought, maybe Chen Zhilun used this rifle to kill many American devils on the Korean battlefield.

The leadership called for using the energy of fighting the enemy in production, and Company Commander Chen Zhilun followed suit. He shifted his efforts to stoking the boiler. In no time, the boiler efficiency broke through the 90% mark, the red arrow went straight up, and it looked like it was heading for 95%.

During work hours, his eyes were fixed on the raging fire in the furnace, as if the fire in his heart fueled the fire in the furnace, causing the boiler efficiency to rise straight up.

I happily congratulated our company commander, and he patted my shoulder and asked, "Militiaman, do you dare to chase after me?" Without hesitation, I said, "No problem."

Although my boiler efficiency indicator had jumped over the 95% mark, which was quite satisfactory, I was still not content. According to Company Commander Chen, we had not yet directly supported the People's Liberation Army brothers on the front lines.

It seems that the higher authorities knew what was on our minds and did something very satisfying this morning.

We fought on the oil construction site. As soon as the bugle sounded, we carried and hauled, and the sounds of battle broke through the silent sky. By daybreak, when the sun peeked out, we had dry-distilled 100 tons of oil from coal. Looking at the colorful lights reflected in the oil in the pool, I thought of the fighters on the coast. This 100 tons of oil is considered our gift, and we have played the role of an assistant and reserve force for the front-line troops. This 100 tons of oil can be used to shoot down enemy planes and sink enemy ships.

    民兵日记
    石景山发电厂工人　阎一忠
    我背起步枪，当起光荣的民兵了。大伙用又高兴，又嫉妒的眼光瞅着我说：“好神气哪”。我把头抬得高高的，故意把肩上的枪摇晃摇晃……。
    我小心地抚摸着我的黑亮黑亮的、沉甸甸的小步枪。发下枪来的那一天，我怀着万分好奇的心情打响了第一枪，正高兴的时候，我们的连长严厉地批评我说：“那怎么行！当兵就要像当兵的样子，不许乱打枪！”我红了脸怪不好意思的说：“我不懂，你给我讲讲吧。”他熟练的把枪拿过去，只看了两下就说：“以后还要讲，我先给你说说吧。我使过这种步枪，是美国造30步枪，经蒋介石运输大队送给咱们的，有效射程是二千七百公尺。以后咱们训练好了还来好的”。我想，也许陈之伦在朝鲜战场上就用这种步枪打死不少美国鬼子呢。
    领导上号召把打敌人的劲头用在生产上，陈之伦连长照办了。他把力量转到司炉上。三下五去二，锅炉效率就突破了九十大关，红箭头直线上升，眼瞅着奔九十五去了。
    上班的时候，他的两只眼睛紧盯着炉膛的烈火，好像他心中的怒火助燃了炉膛中的烈火，把锅炉效率烧得直线上升。
    我高兴地为我们的连长祝贺，他拍拍我的肩膀问：“民兵同志，敢不敢追我”。我毫不思索的说：“没问题。”
    虽然我的锅炉效率指标跃过九十五大关，满够意思了，但是我还不满足，按照陈连长的话说，我们还没有直接支援前线解放军弟兄。
    好像上级知道了我们的心事，今天早晨干了一件大快人心的事。
    我们战斗在石油工地。号角一响，背的背扛的扛，撕杀声划破寂静的天空。到天明，太阳露头的时候，从煤里干馏出一百吨石油。我看着池子里，石油反映出来的花花绿绿的光彩，想起了沿海的战斗员们。这一百吨石油，算做我们的礼品，我们起了一个前线部队的助手和后备军的作用，这一百吨石油可以用来打落敌机、击沉敌舰了。
