Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 2nd: The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formulated specific measures to ensure the overfulfillment of this year's steel production targets.

　　Enabling a large number of newly built indigenous blast furnaces to quickly enter normal production is key to Heilongjiang Province's fulfillment of this year's steel production targets. To this end, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a metallurgical and mechanical conference in Jiamusi. The conference proposed that all counties in the province should take the experience of Linkou County in creating a situation where everyone participates in iron smelting as a benchmark. The indigenous blast furnaces in this county are simple to build, requiring only two hundred red bricks plus some clay, and can be built by four people in half a day, producing two hundred and forty catties of iron per day. The conference required all counties to build three to five furnaces first, and within seven to ten days to grasp the rules of normal production, and then immediately build thousands of indigenous blast furnace clusters on already exploited mining sites.

　　The conference also decided that all cities and counties with mountainous areas should organize two or three local geological teams to go into the mountains to find mineral deposits, combining mass prospecting with professional geological work, prospecting and mining simultaneously, to ensure the needs of blast furnace iron smelting. At the same time, wherever mining is underway, roads should be built immediately to ensure the transportation of ore.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, September 2nd: After the release of the call from the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a Jilin Provincial Steel Production Leap Forward Broadcasting Conference on the 1st, to further mobilize the entire Party and all the people to guarantee the overfulfillment of the province's steel production tasks.

　　The main venue of the broadcasting conference was located in Changchun, with branch venues in Jilin and Tonghua. Three million people participated in the conference. Fu Zhensheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said at the meeting that Jilin Province's industrial production tasks in the last four months of this year are quite heavy, especially the steel production task; because the steel industry is a deficient industry in this province. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously develop the steel industry, to achieve self-reliance, and strive to support other areas. The Provincial Committee proposed that the province should complete the production of 300,000 tons of iron and 100,000 tons of steel this year. This task must be overfulfilled.

　　Fu Zhensheng said that in order to complete the above tasks, mining must take the lead, and a broad mass movement of reporting, prospecting, and mining should be launched throughout the province; the construction of iron smelting furnaces must keep up; and strengthening the leadership of the Party is the decisive condition for ensuring the completion of the tasks. The entire province should focus on steel production as the central task. The slogans are: Mobilize the whole Party and all the people, work hard for one hundred and twenty days, and strive to overfulfill the steel production tasks; take steel as the key link, drive other industrial production, and strive to comprehensively complete this year's industrial leap forward plan.

　　At the meeting, the Party committee secretaries of many regions expressed their support for the Party's instructions and guaranteed the completion and overfulfillment of the tasks.

　　黑龙江推广林口经验人人动手炼铁
　　吉林开展群众性报矿探矿开矿运动
    新华社哈尔滨2日电　中共黑龙江省委已订出具体措施，保证超额完成今年的钢铁生产任务。
    让大批新建土高炉迅速地投入正常生产，是黑龙江省完成今年钢铁生产任务的关键。为此，中共黑龙江省委最近在佳木斯召开了冶金、机械会议。会议提出：全省各县都要以林口县创造的人人都动手炼铁的经验为标兵。这个县的土高炉建造简单，只要二百块红砖加些粘土、用四个人半天时间就能建成一个炉，一天可以炼铁二百四十斤。会议要求各县先搞三、五个，在七天到十天内要摸到正常生产的规律，然后立即在已开采的矿点上建起成千座土高炉群。
    会议还决定，凡有山区的市县，都要组织两三个土地质大队上山找矿，使群众性的找矿与地质专业相结合，边找边采，以保证高炉炼铁需要。同时，凡是开矿的地方，都要马上修路，保证运输矿石的需要。
    据新华社长春2日电　党中央政治局扩大会议的号召发布以后，中共吉林省委在1日召开了吉林省钢铁生产跃进广播大会，进一步动员全党全民保证超额完成全省钢铁生产任务。
    广播大会中心会场设在长春，吉林、通化两地设分会场。参加会议的有三百万人。中共吉林省委书记处书记富振声在会上说，吉林省在今年的最后四个月当中，工业生产的任务相当繁重，特别是钢铁生产任务；因为钢铁工业在本省是缺门工业。因此，必须大力发展钢铁工业，作到自力更生，并且力争支援外地。省委提出，今年全省要完成三十万吨铁、十万吨钢的生产任务。这个任务必须超额完成。
    富振声说，要完成以上的任务，采矿必须走在前头，在全省开展广泛群众性的报矿、探矿、开矿的运动；炼铁炉的建设必须跟上去；加强党的领导是保证完成任务的决定性条件。全省要以钢铁生产为中心任务。口号是：全党全民总动员，苦战一百二十天，为超额完成钢铁生产任务而奋斗；以钢为纲，把其他工业生产带动起来，为全面完成今年工业跃进计划而奋斗。
    会上，许多地区的党委书记表示拥护党的指示，保证完成和超额完成任务。
