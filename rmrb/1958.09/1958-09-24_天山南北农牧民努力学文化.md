All Ethnic Groups Unite to Attack the Fortress of Culture
Farmers and Herdsmen in Tianshan North and South Strive to Learn Culture

In the busy season of agricultural and pastoral production, farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the Tianshan Mountains, both north and south of Xinjiang, have launched a wave of enthusiasm for learning culture without delaying production or study. Currently, according to statistics from 29 counties and cities, more than 460,000 young and middle-aged farmers and herdsmen have participated in literacy campaigns. The number of learners has reached 63% of the total number of illiterate and semi-literate people in the aforementioned counties and cities, and some illiteracy-free townships, villages, and communes have begun to emerge.

In the vast countryside, the walls of many streets and the trunks of large trees are covered with Uyghur alphabet letters and various cultural revolution slogans. Many farmers have written Uyghur or Chinese characters on their houses, farm tools, and various utensils, so that they can study while walking, producing, cooking, or resting. In the fields, learning blackboards hanging on large trees at the edge of the fields can be seen everywhere. Many farmers bring books and study in the fields during lunch and rest breaks. Many production teams also hold a class in the fields after work in the evening before going home for dinner. In Bachu County, where 130,000 Uyghur farmers live, a county-wide literacy campaign has been launched since June. Of the more than 58,000 illiterate and semi-literate people in the county, more than 53,000 have enrolled.

Not only does every team have a people's school, but they have also organized classes and mutual aid groups according to the students' level. About 10,000 people in the county are participating in literacy work. Thanks to the in-depth and extensive organization of literacy work, more than 2,500 people in the county have so far escaped illiteracy. In Changji County, Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, where there are more illiterate people, 80% of the illiterate are currently participating in learning.

In Yining City and Suiding County in northern Xinjiang, more than 90% of young and middle-aged farmers and herdsmen have entered people's schools, spare-time primary schools, and Red and Expert schools in the past two months, basically realizing the opportunity for everyone to learn culture. Most of the herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Barkol Kazak Autonomous County in Hami Prefecture have also participated in the literacy campaign. Most of the herdsmen on the grasslands carry books with them, reading while grazing cattle and sheep. The people of the whole county strive to become an illiteracy-free county by the end of the year.

Under the inspiration of the great leap forward in agricultural and pastoral production and the general line, farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups have further felt the distress of not having culture. Farmers and herdsmen in many places have proposed to change the past situation of learning in winter and forgetting in summer, and insist on year-round learning. (Ding Wen)

    各族人民齐攻文化堡垒
    天山南北农牧民努力学文化
    新疆天山南北各族农牧民在农牧业生产紧张的季节里，掀起了生产、学习两不误的学习文化的热潮。目前，据二十九个县、市的统计，已有四十六万多青壮年农牧民参加了扫盲学习，学习人数已达到上述各县文盲和半文盲总数的63％，并且开始出现了一些无盲乡、无盲村和无盲社。
    在广大农村里，许多街道的墙壁和大树的树杆上，都写上了维文字母和各种文化革命的标语，许多农民在自己的房屋里、农具和各种用具上也写上了维文或汉文单字，以便在走路、生产、做饭、休息的时候都能学习。在田间，到处都可以看到挂在地头大树上的学习黑板，许多农民带着书本，在中午吃饭和休息时就在地里学习。许多生产队在晚上收工后，还要在地里集中上一次课，才回家吃饭。十三万维吾尔族农民聚居的巴楚县，从6月起就掀起了全县性的扫盲运动，全县的五万八千多文盲和半文盲，已有五万三千多人入了学。
    他们不仅是队队有民校，并且还按学员的程度编了班和互助组，全县参加扫盲工作的达一万人左右。该县由于扫盲工作组织的深入广泛，到目前已有二千五百多人摆脱了文盲状态。文盲较多的昌吉回族自治州昌吉县，目前也有80％的文盲参加了学习。
    在北疆的伊宁市和绥定县有90％以上的青壮年农牧民，在近两个月来都分别进入了民校、业余小学和红专学校，基本上实现了人人获得学文化的机会。哈密专区巴里坤哈萨克族自治县的各族牧民，大多数也已参加了扫盲运动。在草场上的牧民大多带着书本，一边放牛羊，一边读书，全县人民力争在年底前变成无盲县。
    在全疆农牧业生产大跃进和总路线的鼓舞下，各族农牧民进一步感到没有文化的苦恼，许多地方的农牧民提出了改变以往冬天学、夏天忘的情况，坚持常年学习的要求。　（丁文）
