Hebei Province Emerges with Four Cities and Counties Producing Over 1,000 Tons of Iron
    Baoding: City-wide Mobilization Leaps to First Place
    Xingtai: 60,000-Strong Army Engaged in Battle
    Yuanshi: Learning from Wu'an, Catching Up with Wu'an
    Shahe: Three Days of Hard Battle Jumps to 1,000

    (Report from this newspaper) As National Day approaches, the vast numbers of cadres and masses in Baoding City, with soaring enthusiasm, launched a large iron-smelting satellite on September 26th, with a daily output of 2,249 tons of iron.

    The high-yield satellite creation is a result of the city's leading cadres and masses earnestly implementing the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, with emphasis on the indigenous. After the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call on September 17th to produce 10,000 tons of iron daily to greet National Day, Party committees at all levels conscientiously implemented the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with emphasis on the indigenous and the small-scale, and launched airing of views, debates on this issue, vigorously criticizing the idea of abandoning indigenous methods for foreign ones. Subsequently, the fighting slogan "Catch up with Lushan, surpass Wu'an, determined to achieve double-thousand tons, present a gift before National Day" was put forward among the people of the city. More than 200,000 steel-making soldiers from government offices, factories, people's communes, the military, schools, and shops threw themselves into the great battle of smelting. More than 20,000 vehicles of all sizes and more than 13,000 donkey carts were invested in the transportation front; more than 8,000 Young Pioneers also came to serve as transportation soldiers. A sea of people, a torrent of vehicles and horses, fought day and night. By September 24th, the city had built 71,797 indigenous furnaces.

    With the furnaces built, in order to break through the second technical barrier, the city's leading cadres personally took action and worked with the masses to summarize operating methods, conduct research and experiments, and organized more than 120 cadres to take ore to Wu'an County to learn iron-smelting technology, and immediately organized flight technology training classes to teach the technology in various places. In this way, the technical barrier was quickly broken. On September 25th, 68,964 indigenous furnaces were ignited. After a day and night of hard work, at zero o'clock on the 26th, a large satellite with a daily output of 2,249 tons of iron was launched.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 27th. Xingtai County, Hebei Province, created a new record of producing 1,556 tons of iron in thirteen hours on the 25th. Currently, the county is deploying its second steel battle, determined to create a new record of producing double-thousand tons of iron daily to celebrate National Day.

    The news that Wu'an County, Hebei Province, had created a new record of producing 1,000 tons of iron daily greatly encouraged the iron-smelting enthusiasm of the cadres and masses in Xingtai County. The number of people in the county engaged in the iron and steel front increased sharply to 61,000. After three days and nights of hard work, the county built 2,649 indigenous furnaces. Together with the existing indigenous furnaces, more than 6,000 indigenous furnaces were put into production on September 25th. On this day, from the ignition at four o'clock in the morning to the statistics at five o'clock in the afternoon, the county produced a total of 1,556 tons of iron. According to the inspection by the acceptance team, the quality of the iron was generally good.

    (Report from this newspaper) On the basis of a previous daily iron production of four tons, Yuanshi County created a new record of 1,124.6 tons of iron on the 25th (including 360 tons of clay iron), laying a good foundation for a greater leap forward in pig iron production in the future.

    The main reason for the county's new record was the vigorous promotion of Wu'an County's experience in indigenous iron smelting. The county built 11,515 indigenous furnaces in two days. On the 25th, after 8,260 indigenous furnaces were put into production, 1,124.6 tons of iron were produced on the same day.

    In order to ensure that the transportation vanguard could travel unimpeded, the county organized sufficient transportation forces, and repaired twenty-five li of highway overnight on the 23rd. Various vehicles were dispatched to timely supply the materials needed for iron smelting, such as ore, coal, and limestone.

    In the midst of vigorously engaging in indigenous iron smelting, the Yuanshi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party adopted the leadership methods of "six fixings" (fixing leadership, fixing time, fixing tasks, fixing labor, fixing equipment, fixing quality) and "four visits to the furnace" (experimenting, meeting, eating, sleeping). The county's 80,000-strong smelting army, organized and planned, threw themselves into the battle and quickly achieved great results. Now, on the basis of this victory, the people of the county are summing up experience and fighting day and night to achieve a daily iron production of 3,000 tons.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 27th. The daily output of pig iron in Shahe County, Hebei Province, has jumped to 1,000 tons. The county produced a total of 1,047.9 tons of pig iron from 12:00 noon on September 24th to 12:00 noon on September 25th.

    Before September 19th, only seventy-seven furnaces in Shahe County were put into production, with a daily pig iron output of less than one ton. In order to quickly change this situation, the county implemented widespread mobilization. By September 24th, in three days, the county put into production 4,735 indigenous furnaces and small blast furnaces. Throughout the county, from mountainous areas to plains, people engaged in iron smelting could be seen everywhere. During the day, smoke billowed, and at night, the red light filled the sky. By noon on the 25th, the county victoriously broke through the daily pig iron production barrier of 1,000 tons.

    河北出现四个千吨市、县
    保定：全市动员跃居第一
    邢台：六万大军投入战斗
    元氏：学习武安赶上武安
    沙河：苦战三天跳到一千
    本报讯  当国庆节即将到来的时候，保定市的广大干部和群众以冲天的干劲，于9月26日射出了一颗炼铁大卫星，日产铁两千二百四十九吨。
    创出高产卫星是这个市领导干部和群众认真贯彻土洋结合，以土为主的成果。9月17日，中共河北省委提出日产万吨铁迎接国庆节的号召以后，各级党委认真地贯彻了土洋并举，以土为主，以小为主的方针，并就这个问题展开了鸣放、辩论，有力地批判了弃土求洋的思想。接着就在全市人民中提出了：“赶鲁山、超武安，决心实现双千吨，国庆节前把礼献”的战斗口号。二十多万来自机关、工厂、人民公社、部队、学校、商店的钢铁大军投入了冶炼大战斗。投入运输战线的，有两万多大小车辆，一万三千多驴驮；八千多名红领巾也赶来作运输兵。人山人海，车水马龙，昼夜奋战。到9月24日，全市即建起土炉七万一千七百九十七座。
    炉建起来，为了突破第二个技术关，全市领导干部都亲自下手和群众一起总结操作方法，研究试验，并组织一百二十多名干部带着矿石到武安县学习炼铁技术，回来马上组织了飞行技术训练班，到各地传授技术。这样，技术关很快就被突破了。9月25日有六万八千九百六十四座土炉点火开炉。经过一昼夜的苦战鏖战，到26日零点放出了一颗日产铁两千二百四十九吨的大卫星。
    新华社天津27日电  河北省邢台县在25日创造了十三个小时产铁一千五百五十六吨的新纪录，目前，这个县正在部署第二个钢铁战役，决心以创造日产生铁双千吨的新纪录向国庆节献礼。
    河北省武安县创造日产千吨生铁新纪录的消息传到邢台县以后，大大鼓舞了这个县干部群众的炼铁热情。全县投入钢铁战线的人数猛增到六万一千人，经过三昼夜的苦战，全县建成土炉两千六百四十九座，加上原有的土炉，在9月25日就有六千多座土炉投入生产。这一天，从早晨四时点火，到下午五时统计，全县共产铁一千五百五十六吨，根据验收组的检验，铁的质量一般都较好。
    本报讯  元氏县人民在过去日产铁四吨的基础上，在25日，创造了日产铁一千一百二十四点六吨的新纪录（内有瓦铁三百六十吨），为今后生铁生产的更大跃进奠定了良好基础。
    这个县创造这一新纪录，主要是大力推广武安县土法炼铁的经验后获得的。全县在两天中就建起土炉一万一千五百一十五座，25日有八千二百六十座土炉投入了生产后，当天就产铁一千一百二十四点六吨。
    为了让运输先行官畅行无阻，全县组织了足够的运输力量，23日一夜就抢修公路二十五里。各种车辆一齐出动，及时供应了炼铁所需要的矿石、煤炭、石灰石等物料。
    在大搞土法炼铁中，中共元氏县委采取了“六定”（定领导、定时间、定任务、定劳力、定设备、定质量）和“四到炉”（试验、开会、吃饭、睡觉）的领导方法。全县八万冶炼大军，有组织有计划地投入了战斗，很快就获得了巨大战果。现在全县人民正在这一胜利的基础上，总结经验，为达到日产铁三千吨而昼夜奋战中。
    新华社天津27日电  河北省沙河县的生铁日产量跃上了千吨。这个县从9月24日中午十二时到25日中午十二时，共产生铁一千零四十七点九吨。
    沙河县在9月19日前，全县只有七十七个炉子投入生产，日产生铁不到一吨。为了迅速改变这种情况，全县实行了广泛动员，到9月24日，三天的功夫，全县投入生产的土炉和小高炉就达四千七百三十五个。全县从山区到平原，到处可以见到炼铁的人群，白天烟雾滚滚，夜晚红光满天，到25日中午胜利突破了日产生铁千吨关。
