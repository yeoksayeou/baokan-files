Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 11th: According to the Arab News Agency, Lebanese opposition leaders submitted two memoranda to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, who is currently visiting Beirut, on the 10th. In the memoranda, they demanded the withdrawal of American troops and the United Nations observer group from Lebanon, and expressed the Lebanese people's opposition to the nomination of Charles Malik, the foreign minister of the Chamoun group, as the next President of the United Nations General Assembly.

"Al-Joumhouria" reported today that residents living in areas controlled by the rebel forces wrote an open letter to Hammarskjöld on the 10th, demanding the withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon. The letter stated: The crisis in Lebanon is purely an internal affair, caused by Chamoun's bankrupt pro-Western policies. The peaceful people of Lebanon are now living under the threat of American cannons and bayonets, as well as American fleets and planes. The immoral behavior of American troops is poisoning Lebanese youth, and Lebanese women are now afraid to go out on the streets. American troops in Lebanon are attempting to establish atomic bases in Lebanon, which is causing great concern among all Lebanese people because their safety will be threatened.

The newspapers here quoted Lebanese Maronite Archbishop Maayoush as saying that the era of foreign rule is over, and the West must know that the national liberation movement in the Arab world is growing stronger.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 11th: "Al-Nour" stated in an editorial today that Dulles' remarks at a press conference on the 9th showed that the United States opposes and refuses to implement the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Special Session on the Middle East issue. The editorial said that the United States is carrying out conspiracies everywhere in order to keep its troops occupying Arab countries.

The newspaper pointed out that in the face of this disregard for the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, it is necessary to unite all national forces to continue the struggle and resolutely remove the American occupation forces from Arab land. The editorial said that there is no force or means in the world today that can prevent us from achieving this great national goal.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 11th: Cairo's "Al-Shaab" published an editorial saying that Dulles' remarks, made during UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's visit to the Middle East, that the time was not yet ripe for the withdrawal of American occupation troops in Lebanon, showed that the United States brazenly disregards the United Nations and the resolutions on the Middle East issue passed by the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Session based on Arab proposals.

    清除阿拉伯土地上的美国占领者
    黎巴嫩反对党领袖要求美军立即撤走
    阿联报纸谴责美国拒绝执行联大决议
    据新华社大马士革11日电　据阿拉伯通讯社报道，黎巴嫩的反对党派领袖10日把两项备忘录递交给正在贝鲁特访问的联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德。在备忘录中，他们要求美国军队和联合国的观察团撤出黎巴嫩，并且表明了黎巴嫩人民反对提名夏蒙集团的外交部长马利克担任下届联合国大会主席的立场。
    “群众报”今天报道，居住在起义部队控制地区的居民10日写给哈马舍尔德一封公开信要求美国军队撤出黎巴嫩。信中说：黎巴嫩的危机纯粹是内政问题，它是由于夏蒙的破产了的亲西方政策所造成的。黎巴嫩的和平人民现在正在美国的大炮和刺刀以及美国的舰队和飞机的威胁下面过日子。美国军队的不道德行为毒害了黎巴嫩的青年，黎巴嫩的妇女现在都不敢上街。在黎巴嫩的美国军队正企图在黎巴嫩建立原子基地，这引起所有黎巴嫩人民的极大忧虑，因为他们的安全将受到威胁。
    这里的报纸引用黎巴嫩马龙派大主教迈乌什的话说，外国统治的时代已经过去了，西方必须知道阿拉伯世界的民族解放运动正在日益壮大。
    据新华社大马士革11日电  “光明报”今天在社论中指出，杜勒斯9日在记者招待会上的谈话表明，美国反对并且拒绝执行联合国大会紧急特别会议关于中东问题的决议。社论说，美国正在到处进行阴谋活动，以便使它的军队继续占领阿拉伯国家。
    报纸指出，面对这种蔑视联合国大会决议的事实，必须团结一切民族力量继续进行斗争，坚定不移地把美国占领军从阿拉伯的土地上肃清。社论说，现在世界上没有任何力量或手段能够阻止我们达到这个伟大的民族目标。
    据新华社开罗11日电　开罗“人民报”发表社论说，杜勒斯在联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德访问中东期间发表谈话说，在黎巴嫩的美国占领军还不到撤退的时候，这番话表明美国悍然漠视联合国和联合国大会紧急会议根据阿拉伯提案所通过的关于中东问题的决议。
