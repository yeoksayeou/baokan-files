Enraged by the U.S. imperialists' military provocations and war threats, people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life held protest rallies, preparing to dedicate all their strength to deal a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors.

At a mass rally of more than three thousand people, emotions ran high, and people in various ethnic languages raised their arms and shouted, "We must liberate Jinmen and Mazu!" "We must liberate Taiwan!"

He called on all the people of Tibet to strengthen unity and resolutely smash the war provocations and military threats of U.S. imperialism. Apel Awang Jimei, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, emphasized that the Tibetan people will never tolerate U.S. imperialism's interference in our internal affairs, and we must liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands to complete the unification and integrity of the motherland's territory and sovereignty. Tan Guansan, Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, representing all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the plateau, warned U.S. imperialism: If they continue to be enemies of the Chinese people, the revolutionary soldiers will mercilessly chop off the invaders' claws.
