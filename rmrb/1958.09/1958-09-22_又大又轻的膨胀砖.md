Expanded Bricks - Large and Light
Nowadays, no matter what kind of house is being built, a particularly large amount of time is spent on bricklaying. How can bricklaying be made faster, better, and more economical? Teachers and students of the Civil Engineering Department of Tsinghua University have developed an expanded brick. This brick is particularly light, and will not sink when placed on water. It has soundproofing properties, so there is no need to add additional soundproofing materials when building walls with it. It has great adhesion, and can be made as large as the brick kiln. Using it to build walls is as convenient as installing prefabricated panels, and it also facilitates mechanization. It can also be used as roofing panels and flooring. The raw materials used for this brick are also very common: readily available clay and some sawdust.

Its manufacturing method is also relatively simple. The production cost of expanded bricks is only about one-half that of ordinary red bricks.

    又大又轻的膨胀砖
    现在不论盖什么房子，花在砌砖上的时间特别多。怎样使砌砖也能多快好省呢？清华大学土木系的师生研究出了一种膨胀砖。这种砖的身体特别轻，放在水上不会下沉。它具有隔音的性能，用它砌墙就可以不必再附加隔音材料。它的粘性大，烧砖的窑有多大，就可以把它制成多大。用它来砌墙就和安装预制板一样的方便，也便于实行机械化。它还可以作屋面板、地板。这种砖所用的原料也很普通，就是到处皆有的粘土加一些锯末。
    它的制造方法也比较简单。膨胀砖的生产成本只有普通红砖的二分之一左右。
