Title: Shifting the Blame for Aggression, Slandering the Chinese People: Eisenhower Distorts the Truth

Xinhua News Agency, September 20th: U.S. President Eisenhower wrote a letter to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev on September 13th, responding to Khrushchev's letter to him of September 7th.

In this letter, Eisenhower did his utmost to call black white and distort the truth, attempting to shirk the responsibility for the United States' expanding aggression against China, thereby seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. He also attempted to use atomic blackmail and intimidation to prevent the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands. Eisenhower also viciously slandered the Soviet Union in the letter and shamelessly asked the Soviet Union to "urge" our country to "exercise restraint." The full text of Eisenhower's reply is as follows:

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I have received your letter of September 7th. I agree with your opinion that there is a dangerous situation in the Taiwan area. As for the root cause of the danger in this situation, I disagree with your opinion.

The current tension in the Taiwan area is directly caused by the actions of the Chinese Communists, not by the actions of the Republic of China, nor by the United States.

The fact is that after a long period of relative calm in that area, the Chinese Communists, without any reason, suddenly launched a fierce bombardment of Jinmen and began to obstruct the normal supply of Jinmen Islands' military and civilians. This intense military activity began on August 23rd—about three weeks after your visit to Beijing. The official radio station in Beijing has repeatedly announced that the purpose of these military actions is to seize Taiwan (Formosa) by force, as well as Jinmen and Mazu. Almost every broadcast from Beijing links Taiwan (Formosa) and the coastal islands together as the targets of the so-called "Chinese People's Liberation Army."

Therefore, the question is whether the Chinese Communists want to achieve their ambitions through the use of force, as they did in Korea, or whether they want to accept the important necessity of peace and order in the nuclear age world and declare their abandonment of the use of force as a tool to satisfy their territorial demands. That territory has never been under the jurisdiction of Communist China. On the contrary, the Republic of China (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek remnant traitorous clique in Taiwan - Xinhua editor's note) - despite the various adjectives you attach to it for ideological reasons - is recognized by the majority of sovereign states in the world, and its government has exercised and continues to exercise jurisdiction over that territory. U.S. military forces are operating in the Taiwan area to fulfill treaty obligations to the Republic of China to assist it in defending Taiwan (Formosa) and the Penghu (Pescadores) Islands. They are there to help resist aggression—not to commit aggression. Twisting the truth, as contained in your letter, cannot change this fact.

The United States Government has expressed its welcome to the willingness of the Chinese Communists to resume the ambassadorial-level talks that began in Geneva three years ago to find ways to ease tensions in the Taiwan area. In the past, the representative of the United States participating in this meeting has tried every reasonable means to persuade the representative of the Chinese Communists to reach a common declaration renouncing the use of force in the Taiwan area; but the latter stubbornly refused to reach such an agreement. The United States hopes that an understanding can be reached through this re-establishment of talks to ensure that force will not be used in efforts to resolve the problems there.

I regret to say that I do not see that your letter is trying to find the kind of common language that could indeed help eliminate the dangers that exist in the current situation in the Taiwan area.

On the contrary, your letter's description of the situation seems to be serving the ambitions of international communism, rather than stating the facts. I also note that you have not written to the leaders of the Chinese Communists, urging them to exercise restraint. If your letter to me is not just a means of unilaterally condemning the actions of the United States, but is indeed an expression of a desire to seek common language for peace, then I suggest that you urge these leaders to stop their military activities and instead adopt a policy of peaceful resolution of the Taiwan dispute.

If the leaders of the Chinese Communists can indeed be persuaded to believe in negotiation and be willing to reconcile, in order to resolve the various issues that have a tendency to disturb the peace in the Formosa area, then I assure you that the United States, on its side, will sincerely work in that spirit for the same purpose.

Sincerely,
Dwight D. Eisenhower (Signature)

### 推卸侵略罪责　诬蔑中国人民  艾森豪威尔颠倒是非

    推卸侵略罪责　诬蔑中国人民
    艾森豪威尔颠倒是非
    新华社20日讯　美国总统艾森豪威尔曾在9月13日写信给苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，回答赫鲁晓夫9月7日给他的信。
    艾森豪威尔在这封信中极尽其指黑为白，颠倒是非的能事，企图推卸美国扩大对中国的侵略，从而严重威胁远东和世界和平的责任。他还企图用原子讹诈和恫吓来阻止中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿。艾森豪威尔并在信中恶毒地诬蔑苏联，并且无耻地要苏联“敦促”我国“有所节制”。艾森豪威尔的复信全文如下：
    亲爱的主席先生：
    我已经接到你9月7日的来信。我同意你的意见：台湾地区是存在着危险的局势的。至于这一局势中的危险的根源，我不同意你的意见。
    目前台湾地区的紧张状态是中国共产党的行动直接造成的，不是中华民国的行动造成的，也不是美国造成的。
    事实是，在那个地区的一个长时期的相对平静之后，中国共产党人，毫无端由地，突然对金门发动猛烈的炮轰，并且开始阻挠对金门列岛军民的正常供应。这一激烈的军事活动是在8月23日开始的——在你访问北平之后三个星期左右。北平的官方电台一再宣布，这些军事行动的目的是要以武力夺取台湾
  （福摩萨），也要以武力夺取金门和马祖。北平的几乎每一次广播，都把台湾（福摩萨）和沿海岛屿联系在一起，作为所谓“中国人民解放军”的目标。
    因此，问题是，中国共产党人究竟是想要像他们在朝鲜所作过的那样，通过运用武力来实现他们的野心呢，还是要接受原子核时代世界和平和秩序的重要必要条件，而宣布放弃使用武力作为满足他们的领土要求的工具。该领土从来没有在共产党中国的管辖之下。相反地，中华民国（即台湾蒋介石残余卖国集团——新华社编者）——尽管你为了意识形态上的原因，给它加上种种的形容词——是得到世界大多数主权国家的承认的，它的政府过去和现在都在对该领土行使管辖权。美国军事部队在台湾地区进行活动是为了履行对中华民国承担的协助它保卫台湾（福摩萨）和澎湖（佩式卡多尔）列岛的条约义务。它们到那里去，是为了帮助抵抗侵略——不是为了进行侵略。像你的来信中所包含的那样的颠倒是非的说法是不能改变这一事实的。
    美国政府对于中国共产党人愿意恢复三年前在日内瓦开始的大使级会谈，来寻找缓和台湾地区紧张局势的办法，已经表示欢迎。过去，美国参加这一会谈的代表曾经尝试用一切合乎情理的办法，来说服中国共产党的代表达成共同宣布在台湾地区放弃武力的协议；但是后者固执地拒绝达成这样的协议。美国希望能够通过这次重新恢复的会谈达成谅解，以保证在设法解决那里的问题的努力中不会使用武力。
    我很遗憾地说，我看不出你的来信是想努力找到确实能够帮助消除台湾地区目前局势中存在的危险的那种共同语言。
    相反地，你的信里对于这一局势的描述似乎是为了替国际共产主义的野心服务，而不是为了说明事实。我还注意到，你根本没有写信给中国共产党的领袖们，敦促他们有所节制。如果你给我的信不仅仅是片面谴责美国的行动的手段，而的确是为了表达为和平而寻求共同语言的愿望，那么我建议你敦促这些领袖们停止他们的军事活动，转而采取和平解决台湾争端的政策。
    如果为了解决有扰乱福摩萨地区和平的趋势的各种问题起见，的确能够劝服中国共产党的领袖们相信谈判并且愿意和解，那么我向你保证，美国这一方面将本着那种精神真诚地为同一目的而努力。
    德怀特·艾森豪威尔谨上（签名）
