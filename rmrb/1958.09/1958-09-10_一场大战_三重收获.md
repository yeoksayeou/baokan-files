One Major Battle, Triple Harvest

It is an excellent thing that over ten thousand students from major, specialized, and secondary metallurgical technical schools have gone up the mountains and down to the factories, standing beside blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and converters, fighting for steel alongside the broad masses of workers.

These over ten thousand students are participating in a major steel battle, but they will reap a triple harvest. First, they will use their knowledge to help various regions build new furnaces and ensure that the furnaces built produce steel and iron normally, contributing their strength and wisdom to completing the target of 10.7 million tons of steel this year. Second, they will increase their perceptual knowledge. Having only book knowledge without practice means that knowledge is incomplete. Now, going to the blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and converters, going into practical production, combining education with productive labor, and combining theory with practice can transform incomplete knowledge into complete knowledge. Third, they can learn from the working class, not only learning from their practical experience but also learning from the working class's noble style, transforming their petty-bourgeois or bourgeois thoughts and feelings, and taking a step forward on the path of being both red and expert.

We wish these students a triumphant return from this major battle!

　　一场大战　三重收获
    一万多位大、专、中等冶金技术学校的同学上山下厂，到高炉、平炉、转炉旁去，和广大职工群众在一起，为钢铁而战，这是一件非常好的事情。
    这一万多位同学参加的是一场钢铁大战，但却将有三重收获。第一是用自己的知识帮助各地建设新炉子，帮助建设起来的炉子正常出钢出铁，为今年完成一千零七十万吨钢贡献自己的力量和智慧。第二是增长自己的感性知识。光有书本知识，没有实践，这种知识就不完全。现在到高炉、平炉、转炉旁边去，到生产实际中，把教育与生产劳动结合起来，把理论和实践结合起来，就可以变不完全的知识为完全的知识。第三是可以向工人阶级学习，不仅学习他们的实践经验，而且学习他们的工人阶级的高尚风格，改造自己的小资产阶级或资产阶级的思想和感情，在又红又专的道路上迈进一步。
    我们祝这批同学在这场大战中凯旋而归！
