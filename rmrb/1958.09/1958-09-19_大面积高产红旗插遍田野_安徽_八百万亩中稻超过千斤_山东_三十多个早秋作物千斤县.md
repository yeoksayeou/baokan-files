Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 18th: Anhui Province overcame ninety days of drought, and more than 25 million mu of mid-season rice has begun to be harvested. The 8 million mu of mid-season rice that has already been harvested has an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu.

In areas where harvesting began early, many communes, townships, and counties with large-scale high yields have emerged. It is reported that nearly thirty counties and cities in the province have an average mid-season rice yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, among which Langxi, Huaining, and Yuexi counties have average yields of over 1,500 jin per mu. Linquan County in the Huaibei New Rice Area has an average yield of 1,358 jin per mu. There are eighty-nine townships in the province with double 1,000 jin yields, three hundred and thirty-nine communes with double 1,000 jin yields, and one hundred and sixty communes with yields of over 3,000 jin.

This year's mid-season rice in Anhui Province hardly received a single thorough rain from planting to harvest. However, the broad masses of peasants, with their heroic spirit of despising the heavens and enraging the Dragon King, engaged in an unprecedented battle against the drought. In order to prevent a single mu from being affected by the disaster, the peasants, under the leadership of the Party, boldly implemented the drought-resistant method of "transplanting seedlings to water." They transplanted mid-season rice seedlings from some arid hilly areas lacking water sources to areas with water. The province rescued more than 900,000 mu of mid-season rice using this method.

This newspaper reports: After achieving a high yield of 3,015 jin per mu of early rice, the Hongxing Cooperative of Zhongqiao Township, Langxi County, Anhui, has again achieved a large-scale high-yield record of an average mid-season rice yield of 4,000 jin per mu. The total area of mid-season rice in the cooperative this year is 3,504.6 mu. As of September 2nd, 2,846 mu had been harvested, yielding a total of more than 11,380,000 jin of dry grain, with an average yield of over 4,000 jin per mu. According to the estimated yield of the harvested mid-season rice, the average yield of the remaining 658 mu will also reach 4,000 jin. This is the first large-scale mid-season rice "satellite" cooperative in Anhui Province.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th: Shandong Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of early autumn crops. According to incomplete statistics up to the 16th, more than 25 million mu of the province's more than 30 million mu of early autumn crops have been harvested. Heze Prefecture, which has always been a low-yield area, has gloriously achieved the title of a double 1,000-jin prefecture, with an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu for both millet and corn on 1,409,643 mu. Shouzhang County has gloriously achieved the title of a double 5,000-jin county, with an average yield of over 5,000 jin per mu for both millet and corn on 66,345 mu. In addition, there are twenty-three counties with corn yields of 1,000 jin per mu, including Jimo, Gaotang, Linyi, Zhucheng, and Junan; eleven counties with millet yields of 1,000 jin per mu, including Laiwu, Shenxian, Liangshan, and Cangshan; and one sorghum 1,000-jin county—Wulian County. In the large-scale bumper harvest, there are 566.8 mu with corn yields of over 10,000 jin per mu and 4,391.9 mu with millet yields of over 10,000 jin per mu. High-yield "satellites" of various crops have also been continuously launched. Following the high-yield record of 27,312 jin per mu of corn created by the Guangming Cooperative of Zhongcun Township, Huang County, recently, 2.33 mu of sorghum at the Linqing County Agricultural Experiment Station and 2.2 mu of sorghum at the Shimen Song People's Commune in Yanggu County have created records of 15,463 jin and 8 taels and 13,048 jin and 12 taels per mu, respectively. Compared with the yield of the same crops in 1957, these new achievements represent an increase of seven to one hundred and fifty-four times for corn, eight to one hundred and thirty-two times for millet, and seven to one hundred and twenty-four times for sorghum.

    大面积高产红旗插遍田野
    安徽——八百万亩中稻超过千斤
    山东——三十多个早秋作物千斤县
    据新华社合肥18日电　安徽省战胜九十天的干旱，两千五百多万亩中稻普遍开镰收割。已收割的八百万亩中稻，平均每亩产量都在千斤以上。
    在收割得早的地区，已出现许多大面积丰产的社、乡、县。据悉，全省已有近三十个县、市中稻平均亩产在千斤以上，其中郎溪、怀宁、岳西等县平均亩产量都在一千五百斤以上。淮北新稻区临泉县平均亩产一千三百五十八斤。全省中稻双千斤乡有八十九个，双千斤社有三百三十九个，三千斤以上的社有一百六十个。
    安徽省今年的中稻从插到收，几乎未得过一场透雨。但是广大农民以藐视天公、气死龙王的英雄气概，与干旱展开了史无前例的搏斗。为了不使一亩受旱成灾，农民们在党的领导下，还大胆地实行了“移苗就水”的抗旱办法。他们把旱情严重而又缺乏水源的部分岗区的中稻苗，移并到有水地区。全省用这个办法就抢救了九十多万亩中稻。
    本报讯　安徽郎溪县钟桥乡的红星社，在获得早稻平均亩产三千零一十五斤的丰产之后，又出现中稻平均亩产四千斤的大面积高额丰产纪录。全社今年中稻总面积为三千五百零四亩六分，截至9月2日止，已收割二千八百四十六亩，共收干谷一千一百三十八万多斤，平均亩产超过四千斤。根据已收割的中稻产量预计，尚未收割的六百五十八亩多平均亩产也可达到四千斤。这是安徽省第一个大面积的中稻卫星社。
    据新华社济南18日电　山东省早秋作物空前大丰收。到16日止的不完全统计，全省三千多万亩早秋作物，已有二千五百多万亩收割完毕。向来是低产区的菏泽专区，一百四十万九千六百四十三亩谷子、玉米平均亩产量都突破千斤，获得双千斤专区的光荣称号。寿张县六万六千三百四十五亩谷子、玉米，平均亩产都突破五千斤，获得双五千斤县的光荣称号。此外，玉米亩产千斤的有即墨、高唐、临沂、诸城、莒南等二十三县，谷子亩产千斤的有莱芜、莘县、梁山、苍山等十一县，一个高粱千斤县——五莲县。在大面积丰产中，玉米亩产万斤以上的有五百六十六点八亩。谷子亩产万斤以上的有四千三百九十一点九亩。各项作物的高产“卫星”也连续升起。全省继黄县中村乡光明社一点零五亩玉米创亩产二万七千三百一十二斤的高产纪录之后，最近临清县农业试验站二点三三亩高粱和阳谷县石门宋人民公社二点二亩高粱又分别创造亩产一万五千四百六十三斤五两和一万三千零四十八斤十二两的纪录。这些新的成就，与1957年同样作物的亩产比较，玉米增产七倍到一百五十四倍，谷子增产八倍到一百三十二倍，高粱增产七倍到一百二十四倍。
    稻禾密密像森林，
    稻秆腰际绕彩云；
    收割要用大锯锯，
    收下要靠火车运。（转载广西日报）
