    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 13th: Washington dispatch: After interviewing some people in American religious circles, a United Press International reporter reported from Washington on the 12th that people in American religious circles are concerned about the provocative and adventurous actions of the United States in the Taiwan Strait. Church leaders this week are "mobilizing moral pressure with a sense of urgency to oppose [the United States] being drawn into war over the issue of Jinmen and Mazu."

    The news said that "the most significant" of these was a letter to US President Eisenhower signed by Sir Edwin Dahlberg, chairman of the National Council of Churches. The letter requested that the US government "should review all policies and issues that have led to the current crisis." The news said that the letter was "a carefully considered policy statement formulated by leaders of the thirty-four denominations during two days of emergency talks."

    The news said that this concern of people in American religious circles is also reflected in their conversations with government officials. These people said that the United States should now "extricate itself from a situation in which it might be plunged into nuclear war because of a few small islands located in places easily hit by mainland Chinese artillery fire."

    The news said that these religious figures believe that the United States has "gone to the brink twice already in Jinmen and Mazu." They demand that the United States seek a basis for Chiang Kai-shek to withdraw "honorably" from easily attacked locations.

    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 13th: Washington dispatch: US Secretary of Defense McElroy once again issued war threats against the Chinese people at a press conference on the 12th, saying that he believes Jinmen is "part of the Taiwan defense system," and an attack on these islands would empower US President Eisenhower to "take any steps he deems appropriate."

    McElroy also revealed that the US interventionist troops have no intention of withdrawing from Lebanon. He said that the "speed or amount of US troop withdrawal will depend on the success of the United Nations in maintaining peace in the Middle East."

    美教会领袖担心政府玩火烧身
    呼吁动员道义压力制止挑起大战
    新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：美国合众国际社记者在访问美国宗教界一些人士后在12日自华盛顿报道说，美国宗教界人士对于美国在台湾海峡的挑衅冒险行动表示忧虑。教会领袖们在本星期“以一种紧急的心情动员道义压力来反对（美国）为金门和马祖的问题卷入战争”。
    这条消息说，在这里面“最有重大意义的”是由教会全国委员会主席埃德温·达耳伯格爵士署名的写给美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封信。这封信要求美国政府“应该回顾一下所有导致目前危机的政策和问题”。消息说，这封信是“由三十四个教派组成的委员会的领袖们在历时两天的紧急会谈中制订出来的一份经过仔细考虑的政策声明。”
    消息说，美国宗教界人士的这种忧虑也表现在他们同政府官员的谈话里。这些人士说，现在美国应该使它自己“摆脱一种它可能会由于少数位于容易被中国大陆炮火击中的地点的小岛而被投入核战争的形势。”
    消息说，这些宗教界人士认为，美国“在金门和马祖两次走到边缘上已经足够了”。他们要求美国寻找基础使蒋介石“光荣地”撤出容易遭受攻击的地点。
    新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊12日在记者招待会上再一次对中国人民发出战争威胁的叫嚣，他说，他认为金门是“台湾防御体系的一部分”，对这些岛屿的进攻将使美国总统艾森威豪尔有权“采取任何他认为适当的步骤”。
    麦克耳罗伊还透露美国干涉军无意撤出黎巴嫩。他说，美军“撤退的速度或多少要取决于联合国维持中东地区和平所取得的成就”。
