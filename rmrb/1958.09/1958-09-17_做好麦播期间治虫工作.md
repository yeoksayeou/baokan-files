    Do a Good Job in Pest Control During Wheat Sowing Period
    Mai Chong Zu, Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
    Eliminating pests during the autumn sowing period is the most important measure to protect the safe growth of wheat seedlings. The most common and serious pests of wheat are underground pests, among which mole crickets, grubs, and wireworms are the most harmful. They start to harm the wheat seeds as soon as they are sown, and are even more ferocious to the newly emerged seedlings, often causing missing seedlings, broken rows, and even crop failure. Therefore, eliminating underground pests is an urgent task.
    According to the experience of various regions, treating the soil with "666" not only has good effects on mole crickets, grubs, wireworms, etc., but also controls multiple pests such as wheat gall midge, wheat spider mites, and wheat sawflies. This method is simple and easy to implement. Use three catties of 6% "666" powder per mu, mix it with forty catties of dry fine soil, stir evenly, spread it evenly on the ground surface before plowing, and then turn the medicine into the soil. The efficacy can be maintained for two years, and various pests hiding in the ground can be eliminated in one fell swoop. In 1957, many counties in Henan Province conducted demonstrations, and the results were very good. For example, in the Meng County demonstration area, before prevention, there were more than 1,000 wheat gall midge per 25 square inches, and no insect bodies were found after the application of the medicine. At the same time, many mole crickets were found dead on the ground. Therefore, the masses reflected that the advantage of this method is that it saves labor and has a great effect.
    In addition, using "666" powder to mix seeds is also very effective in preventing wireworms. Using "666" to make poisonous grains can control three kinds of pests: mole crickets, grubs, and wireworms. Farmers in Anhui Province also use wolfsbane root powder to control grubs and wireworms, which are also good methods for pest control and seedling protection.

    做好麦播期间治虫工作
    中国农业科学院植保所麦虫组
    消灭秋播期间的害虫是保护麦苗安全生长最主要的措施。为害小麦最普遍而且严重的是地下害虫，这类害虫以蝼蛄、蛴螬、金针虫为害最烈，麦种播下后即开始为害，对刚出土的幼苗加害更凶，常造成缺苗断垅，甚至毁种。因此，消灭地下害虫是一项急不可待的工作。
    综合各地经验：“666”处理土壤不但对蝼蛄、蛴螬、金针虫等有良好的效果，并且兼治小麦吸浆虫、麦园蜘蛛、麦叶蜂等多种害虫。这种方法简便易行，每亩地用6％“666”粉三斤，兑干细土四十斤，搅拌均匀，在犁地前漫撒在地表，随后将药翻入土中，药效可维持二年，躲在地里的多种害虫都可一网打尽。1957年河南省不少县份进行了示范，结果很好。如孟县示范区未防治前吸浆虫每二十五平方寸有虫一千多头，施药后找不到虫体，同时发现很多蝼蛄死于地面。内蒙古固阳县蛴螬严重，经“666”处理土壤后基本消灭了为害。因此，群众反映这种办法好处是：省工、效果大。
    此外，用“666”粉拌种对防治金针虫效果也很好。用“666”制毒谷，能兼治蝼蛄、蛴螬、金针虫三种害虫。安徽省农民还利用狼毒根粉防治蛴螬、金针虫，这些也是灭虫保苗的好办法。
