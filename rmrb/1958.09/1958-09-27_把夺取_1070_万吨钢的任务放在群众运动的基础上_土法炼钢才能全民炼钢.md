Sichuan: Building steel furnaces with various indigenous methods
Zibo: Directly refining sponge iron into good steel
Yuci: Refining carbon steel with crucibles is fast and economical
Lanzhou: Small hand-cranked converters are commonly held throughout the city
Guangzhou: Indigenous methods take the lead in promoting crucible steelmaking

Chongqing, September 26 (Reported by this newspaper) Sichuan Province is using indigenous, small-scale, and mass methods to vigorously carry out a mass steelmaking movement using indigenous methods. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an emergency telephone conference on the evening of the 25th, deploying all special districts and cities in the province to immediately build 30,000 indigenous steelmaking furnaces, and also build a number of small converters.

Currently, all government offices, factories, and schools in Chongqing are vigorously engaging in crucible, small electric furnace, and small converter steelmaking. Colleges and several secondary schools alone have established 36 crucible furnaces and refined 14 tons of steel in a short period. Many factories and handicraft cooperatives have refined steel without adding equipment, using cupola furnaces, gasoline barrels, kerosene barrels, iron drills, and iron hammers for refining, stewing, forging, and stir-frying. Judging from the current situation, a single indigenous steelmaking furnace produces just over one ton of steel per month, which may seem small, but if 30,000 furnaces can be built across the province in a few days, the combined output will exceed 30,000 tons of steel per month, surpassing the steel produced by existing open-hearth furnaces in the province from September 1st to 20th.

The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China calls indigenous steelmaking "another leg of steelmaking," and requires all government cadres and school teachers and students in the province to cultivate experimental plots for indigenous steelmaking. Do not only place hope in large steel plants, but learn to walk on two legs. According to the instructions of the Provincial Committee, the Chongqing Municipal Committee has convened a meeting of secretaries of district committees, further criticizing the one-sided erroneous thinking of looking down on indigenous and small-scale methods and only wanting to engage in foreign and large-scale methods. Starting from the 26th, the whole city has taken action, with cadres in urban government offices, factory workers, students, and residents enthusiastically participating. Preliminary plans for the construction of more than 2,000 indigenous steelmaking furnaces have already been made.

Jinan, September 26 (Reported by this newspaper) The faculty and staff of the Zibo City Building Materials Industry School in Shandong Province, displaying a spirit of daring to think and daring to act creatively, and with the strong support of the Party, have finally, after 27 experiments, used crucibles and sponge iron (i.e., sintered iron in which iron and slag have not been completely separated) to refine high, medium, and low carbon steel. After chemical analysis, the quality fully meets the requirements. This has found a broad outlet for the large-scale utilization of sponge iron, which is of great significance for accelerating steel production in our country.

In the experiment, a small crucible was first made with materials such as coke gemstone powder, graphite powder, and clay. The sponge iron was placed in the crucible and smelted in an electric furnace. The temperature was continuously heated to 1,350 degrees, but the sponge iron did not melt. Later, the experiment was carried out with a large electric furnace used for refractory testing. When the temperature was heated to 1,520 degrees, the sponge iron finally melted into molten steel in the crucible. After cooling, the chemical analysis showed that it was high carbon steel, with a carbon content of 1.39%, which fully met the quality requirements. The carbon content of sponge iron is relatively low, generally around 0.13%. During the smelting process, it absorbed part of the carbon from the graphite crucible, thus it could be refined into high carbon steel.

After continuously refining high carbon steel, people wondered: can we achieve whatever steel we want, according to people's wishes? After many experiments, the ingredients for smelting high, medium, and low carbon steel were finally found: using 70% sponge iron and 30% white pig iron (or gray pig iron) will produce medium carbon steel, and using 60% sponge iron and 40% white pig iron will produce high carbon steel. The method of adding glass, lime, or alkali powder to create slag for desulfurization was adopted to reduce the sulfur content of the steel from 1.5% in the past to 1.3%. Sponge iron can be melted at just 1,430 degrees.

Taiyuan, September 26 (Reported by Xinhua News Agency) The Yuci Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory in Shanxi Province has refined carbon steel in crucible furnaces. This type of furnace has simple equipment, convenient operation, small investment, and quick results. It is a good way to carry out mass steelmaking at present.

The method of crucible steelmaking is: as long as there is a crucible and a crucible furnace to heat the crucible, pig iron and forged iron filings (ferric oxide) can be placed in the crucible furnace to refine steel. The carbon content of a furnace of steel recently refined by the Third Workshop of the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory is 0.12%, which can be used to make machine bases and manufacture agricultural tools.

This crucible furnace uses discarded blue bricks to build the furnace wall, and the inner wall is plastered with fine mud made of quartz sand and clay. The crucible is made of graphite powder, cooked coke powder, and crucible clay. The furnace body is drum-shaped, and a pad is built between the furnace bridge and the crucible with refractory bricks. After the raw materials are loaded into this type of furnace, a small electric motor is used to drive a blower to ignite the coke and heat the crucible to melt it.

Because this type of furnace is simple, a person who does not know anything about steelmaking can learn the complete set of operating methods in a very short period. Now all the workers in the factory have plunged into the upsurge of crucible steelmaking. In the four days from the 21st to the 24th, more than 30 crucible furnaces have been built, many of which have already started steelmaking. The factory's engineers and veteran workers believe that agricultural cooperatives and people's communes that can use indigenous methods to make iron generally have the conditions to use crucibles to make steel.

Lanzhou, September 26 (Reported by Xinhua News Agency) In the vigorous steelmaking movement in Lanzhou factories, government offices, schools, and streets, a fast steel-producing small hand-cranked converter has emerged, producing a furnace of steel every 15 to 20 minutes, with each furnace producing about 100 kilograms of steel. The Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting in August at the Lanzhou Prospecting Machinery Factory, which was the first to adopt this type of small converter for steelmaking, and summarized the advantages of this type of small converter. It was decided to build a large number of these small converters in Lanzhou, making them an important force in the city's production of 100,000 tons of steel this year.

This 100-kilogram small converter is only 1.56 meters tall, and can be manufactured by general sand-casting factories and handicraft production cooperatives. The small converters that have already been built are all made of scrap iron casting, or welded from old iron plates, gasoline drums, etc. Generally, only four people are required to operate during production, and two sets of furnaces can be installed to maintain continuous production day and night.

Guangzhou, September 26 (Reported by Xinhua News Agency) Guangzhou has greatly promoted crucible steelmaking, which requires little investment and produces steel quickly. This is an important measure taken by the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to mobilize the whole Party and the whole people to use indigenous methods to quickly produce steel.

The Huanghuagang Red Flag Commune, the Zhongnan Cooperative Factory, and Guangya Middle School in Guangzhou were the first to achieve results in crucible steelmaking. According to the experience of these units, the advantages of crucible steelmaking are that it requires little investment; although the output is low, the steel production is fast; a crucible with a capacity of 15 to 20 kilograms only requires a half-horsepower to one-horsepower motor, and a hand bellows can also be used instead. The operation is relatively simple; the quality of the steel produced is relatively high; and in the case of sufficient air volume, bituminous coal can be used as fuel. After crucible steelmaking was promoted throughout the city, it is estimated that this item alone will produce more than 8,100 tons of steel by the end of September.

    土法炼钢才能全民炼钢
    四川：  用各种土办法大建炼钢炉
    淄博：  直接把海绵铁炼成了好钢
    榆次：  用坩锅炼炭素钢又快又省
    兰州：  全市普遍举办手摇小转炉
    广州：  土法先上马推广坩锅炼钢
    本报重庆26日电  四川省采取土、小、群办法大搞群众性土法炼钢运动。中共四川省委25日晚召开了紧急电话会议、布置全省各专区、市立即赶建三万个土炼钢炉，并建一批小转炉。
    目前，重庆市各机关、工厂、学校都在大搞坩锅、小电炉、小转炉炼钢。单是大专学校和几个中等学校，就已经建立了三十六个坩锅炉，短期内炼出了十四吨钢。许多工厂、手工业社不必增添设置，用化铁炉、汽油桶、煤油桶，铁钻、铁锤等炼、焖、锻、炒，也炼出了钢。据现在情况看，一个土炼钢炉每月出钢不过一吨多，好像为数不多，但全省几天之内就可建炉三万，合起来每月就可炼钢三万吨以上，超过全省9月1日至20日现有平炉炼钢的数字。
    中共四川省委称土法炼钢为“炼钢的另外一条腿”，要求全省机关干部、学校师生都种土法炼钢试验田。不要只把希望寄托在大钢铁厂，要学会两条腿走路。重庆市委根据省委指示，已开了全市各区委书记会议，进一步批判了看不起土的小的，只想搞洋的大的片面的错误思想，从26日起，全市已普遍行动起来，城区机关干部，工厂职工、学生、居民都兴致勃勃，初步筹建的土炼钢炉就已经达到两千多座。
    本报济南26日电  山东省淄博市建筑材料工业学校教职员工，发扬敢想敢干的独创精神，在党的大力支持下，经过二十七次试验，终于用坩锅、海绵铁（即铁和渣质尚未完全分离的烧结铁）炼出了高、中、低炭钢，经过化验分析，完全合乎质量要求。它为大量利用海绵铁找到了广阔的出路，对加速我国钢铁生产有着重大意义。
    在试验中，首先用焦宝石粉、石墨粉、粘土等材料作了一个小坩锅，把海绵铁放到坩锅里用电炉冶炼，温度一直加热到一千三百五十度，海绵铁都没有熔化。后来用做耐火度实验的大型电炉进行试验，温度加热到一千五百二十度时，海绵铁终于在坩锅里熔化成了钢水；冷却以后，经过化验分析，是高炭钢，含炭量在1.39％，完全合乎质量要求。海绵铁的含炭量较低，一般的均在0.13％左右，在冶炼中吸收了石墨坩锅上的一部分炭，因而能炼成高炭钢。
    经过连续炼出高炭钢以后，人们设想：能不能做到随着人们的意愿，要什么钢就有什么钢呢？经过多次试验，终于摸出了冶炼高、中、低炭钢的配料成份：用70％的海绵铁，30％的白口铁（或灰口铁），冶炼出来就是中炭钢，用60％的海绵铁，40％的白口铁，冶炼出来就是高炭钢。采取加玻璃、石灰或碱粉造渣脱硫的办法，使钢的含硫量由过去的1.5％降低到1.3％。只要一千四百三十度即可以熔化海绵铁。
    据新华社太原26日电  山西省榆次经纬纺织机械厂在坩锅炉中炼出了炭素钢。这种炉子设备简单，操作方便，投资小，收效快，是当前开展群众性炼钢的好办法。
    坩锅炼钢的办法是：只要一个坩锅和加热坩锅的坩锅炉，将生铁和锻压铁屑（氧化铁）放在坩锅炉里，就能炼出钢来。经纬纺织机械厂第三车间最近炼出的一炉钢的含炭量是0.12％，可以用来作机器底座和制造农具。
    这个坩锅炉是用废弃的青砖砌炉壁，用石英沙和粘土掺和成的细泥抹内壁，坩锅是用石墨粉、熟焦粉与坩土制成的，炉体成鼓形，在炉桥与坩锅之间用耐火砖筑成垫台。这种炉子装了原料后，用一部小电动机带动鼓风机吹燃焦炭，加热坩锅就可熔炼。
    由于这种炉子简单，一个完全不懂炼钢的人在很短时间内就能学会全套操作方法。现在全厂职工都已投入了坩锅炼钢的热潮，在21日到24日的四天中，已经建成了三十多座坩锅炉，其中有许多炉已经开始炼钢。这个厂的工程师和老工人们认为，凡是能够用土法炼铁的农业社、人民公社，一般都有条件用坩锅炼钢。
    新华社兰州26日电  兰州市工厂、机关、学校、街道在大搞炼钢运动中，出现了一种快速出钢的手摇小转炉，每十五分钟到二十分钟就出一炉钢，每炉出钢一百来公斤。中共兰州市委8月份曾在最先采用这种小转炉炼钢的兰州探矿机械厂召开现场会议，总结了这种小转炉的优点，决定在兰州市大量建设这种小转炉，使其成为今年全市生产十万吨钢的重要力量。
    这种一百公斤的小转炉，身高只有一点五六公尺，一般翻砂厂和手工业生产合作社都可以制造。已经建设起来的小转炉，都是利用废铁铸制，或者用旧铁板、汽油筒等加以焊接制成。生产时一般只要四个人操作，安装两套炉子，就可以轮流保持昼夜不停地生产。
    新华社广州26日电  广州市已经大量推广投资少、出钢快的坩锅炼钢。这是中共广州市委为动员全党全民用土法上马快速出钢而采取的一项重要措施。
    广州市黄花岗红旗社、中南合作工厂和广雅中学最先用坩锅炼钢做出成绩。根据这些单位的经验，坩锅炼钢的优点是投资少；产量虽低但出钢快；容量十五到二十公斤的坩锅，只需用半马力到一马力的电动机，也可以用手风箱代替，操作较简易；炼出的钢质量较高；在风量够的情况下，能用白煤作燃料。坩锅炼钢在全市推广后，仅这一项预计9月底就能产钢八千一百多吨。
