    Self-Made Noose
    Poem by Yuan Shuipai, Cartoon by Hua Junwu
    This gentleman has long legs,
    Stepping into the hall of the Eastern family,
    And barging into the bedroom of the Western family.
    This gentleman has many hands,
    Snatching the silver vault of the neighbor,
    And feeling the clothes of the neighbor.
    Every hand is caught,
    Every leg is tied fast,
    Self-made noose.
    Three hands, Four Overlords,
    Dealt with and jailed separately,
    Leaving you—
    Clinging to the earth
    —A living disgrace.

    自打绞索圈套
    袁水拍诗　华君武画
    这位先生腿长，
    踏进东家厅堂，
    又闯西家卧房。
    这位先生手多，
    抢了隔壁银库，
    又摸邻舍衣裤。
    只只手被抓到，
    条条腿被绑牢，
    自打绞索圈套。
    三只手，四霸天，
    分别处理收监，
    剩下你——
    扒在地球上
    ——活现眼。
