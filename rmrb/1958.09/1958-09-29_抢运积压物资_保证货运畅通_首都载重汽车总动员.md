Beijing has launched a "satellite" in fully organizing and utilizing vehicles from government offices and enterprises. As of today, all of the city's more than 1,600 heavy-duty trucks have been organized to participate in transportation.

The total number of heavy-duty trucks in Beijing's government offices and enterprises is 28% more than all the vehicles in the transportation departments. In the past, the utilization rate of these vehicles was very low, accounting for only one-third of that of the highway transportation departments. After being organized, the potential of these vehicles has been fully realized. For example, since the eleven universities in Beijing's western suburbs unified dispatch and centralized the use of vehicles, the average vehicle utilization rate has increased from 50% in the past to more than 90%. In the past week, the newly formed teams of vehicles from government offices have worked with the transportation departments to rush the transport of 160,000 tons of goods backlogged at various railway stations.

In the process of organizing vehicles from government offices and enterprises to participate in transportation, the vast majority of leaders, managers, and drivers of government offices and enterprises actively support this method of solving the shortage of transportation tools, which does not require the state to spend money and can produce immediate results. People's Daily, Beijing Daily, and other eleven news organizations used to have tight transportation tasks and often needed to rent vehicles. This time, they took the initiative to establish a transportation cooperation team and made specific calculations and arrangements. Now, they have managed to extract one-third of their vehicles for use by the Dongcheng District Transportation Command, while ensuring that it does not affect the publication of the newspapers. In addition, three trucks have been designated to be under unified dispatch to support urgent transportation needs at any time. Automobile drivers from the Ministry of Communications, with the active consent of the leadership, transferred half of the drivers who drive small cars to form a transportation shock brigade to rush the transport of backlogged materials. The cadres in this ministry who can drive cars have also formed a volunteer driver team, ready to be called upon by the Beijing Municipal Transportation Command at any time. Many leaders of central and Beijing municipal government offices and enterprises have also cancelled car pick-ups for commuting to and from work, freeing up drivers who drive small cars or large buses to drive trucks to transport materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Sept 28th. Beijing dispatched two large automobile transport armies on the 27th to rush transport of backlogged transport materials in the city's railway stations. One army was vehicles from government offices and enterprises, and the other was vehicles from the Beijing Municipal Automobile Transportation Company.

The two armies combined more than 2,600 automobiles, completing 93,000 tons of transport tasks in one day. Both the transport capacity and transport efficiency have increased significantly compared to mid-September. There is now no backlog in the transportation of iron and steel smelting materials in the city. Of the materials transported on September 27, 20% were iron and steel smelting materials.

    抢运积压物资  保证货运畅通
    首都载重汽车总动员
    本报讯  北京在充分组织利用机关企业车辆上放出一颗“卫星”，到今天止，全市一千六百多辆载重汽车已经全部组织起来参加运输。
    北京机关企业载重汽车的总数比运输部门全部车辆还多28％。过去，这些车辆的利用率很低，只占公路运输部门的三分之一。组织起来以后，这些车辆的潜力得到充分发挥。例如，北京西郊十一个高等院校自从统一调度、集中使用车辆以来，车辆的利用率平均由过去的50％提高到90％以上。在最近一周内，全市刚编成队的机关车辆就和运输部门一起，已经把积压在各火车站的十六万吨货物抢运完毕。
    在组织机关企业车辆参加运输过程中，绝大部分机关企业领导人员、管理人员和司机都积极地拥护这种不需国家花钱，就能立即收效的解决运输工具不足的办法。人民日报、北京日报等十一个新闻单位过去的运输任务很紧张，常常需要租车使用。这次，他们主动地成立了交通协作队，并且进行了具体的核算和安排，现在已经做到在保证不影响报纸出报的情况下，抽出三分之一的车辆归东城区运输指挥部使用。另外并指定三部卡车服从统一调配，随时支援急需的运输。交通部的汽车司机，主动征得领导方面的同意，抽调一半开小轿车的司机，成立运输突击队，抢运积压物资。这个部会开汽车的干部也组成了义务司机班，准备随时听候北京市运输指挥部调用。许多中央和北京市机关、企业的领导人员，也纷纷取消上下班的汽车接送，把开小轿车或大客车的司机腾出来，去开卡车运输物资。
    本报讯  北京市在27日出动了两支汽车运输大军，抢运市内各车站的运输积压物资。一支是机关企业车辆，另一支是北京市汽车运输公司的车辆。
    两支大军会合了二千六百多辆汽车，一天完成了九万三千吨的运输任务。运输能力和运输效率都比9月中旬增加了一番。现在，市内钢铁冶炼物资运输上已无积压。9月27日运送的物资中，有20％是钢铁冶炼物资。
