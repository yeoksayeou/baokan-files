Demobilized Soldiers Say:
    We Are Ready to Return to the Front Lines at Any Time
    The US imperialism, regardless of our repeated warnings, dares to threaten us with war; this cannot scare us. We have fought with them before, and they were our defeated foes.

    I am a soldier who was demobilized in 1954, thirty-five years old and in good health. I served as a artillery squad leader in the army and am very familiar with coastal defense, guaranteeing that I can complete combat missions. Now I work as a worker on the railway. After being demobilized, I got married, and have children, and live a happy life. But currently, US imperialism does not allow us to live a happy life. I hope you will convey my determination to Premier Zhou: I am willing to be the first to sign up for the army, take up arms again, and beat the US imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek until they are battered and bloody. After Taiwan is liberated, I will return to my hometown to reunite with my family.
                                                        Yang Rongchang, Zanshan Township, Shahe County, Hebei Province

    We are transferred and demobilized soldiers. In the past, we defeated Chiang Kai-shek armed by US imperialism. On the Korean battlefield, we beat US imperialism bloody. US imperialism is our defeated soldier, a paper tiger.

    Today, the mad dog of US imperialism is once again provoking the 600 million Chinese people, and we can no longer tolerate it. We are waiting for the call of the motherland at any time: to leave the classroom, pick up the gun, return to the front line, and resolutely eliminate the American robbers in the Taiwan Strait.
                                                        Zhang Xiuquan and six others, Department of History, Peking University

    Just as the Chinese people are engaged in an unprecedented large-scale peaceful construction, US imperialism openly mobilizes armed forces, expands its aggression against our country, and directly threatens peace in Asia and the world. We feel extremely angry about this war provocation by US imperialism.

    Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have been an inseparable part of Chinese territory since ancient times. The liberation of these places by the Chinese people is China's internal affair, and no imperialist is allowed to interfere. We fully support Premier Zhou's statement and must liberate Taiwan. American troops must get out of Taiwan.

    We are all soldiers who have just bid farewell to the weapons of peace and transferred to work at the Academy of Sciences. We are not at all unfamiliar with military weapons. Now we are always vigilant and prepared. As long as the motherland gives an order, we will immediately rush to the forefront of the battle and take up arms again to give the imperialists a fatal blow. Finally, we warn the American aggressors: if you dare to open fire on the 600 million Chinese people, then don't even think about turning back; the fish bellies in the Taiwan Strait will be your "resting place."
                                                  Wu Shouyong, Zhou Shiyan and thirteen others,

### 复员军人说：我们随时准备重返前线

    复员军人说：
    我们随时准备重返前线
    美帝国主义不顾我国的再三警告，竟敢用战争威胁我们，这是吓不倒我们的。我们与他们打过仗，它们是我们手下的败将。
    我是在1954年复员的军人，现年三十五岁，身体强壮。在部队当过炮兵班长，对于海防很熟，保证能完成战斗任务。现在我在铁路上当工人，复员后结了婚，有儿有女，生活很幸福。但目前美帝国主义不让我们过幸福的日子，我希望你们把我的决心转告周总理：我愿意第一个报名入伍，重新拿起武器，把美帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪帮打个头破血出，等解放台湾以后，再复员回乡团聚。
                河北省沙河县赞善乡　杨荣昌
    我们是转业、复员军人。过去，我们打败了美帝国主义武装的蒋介石。在朝鲜战场上，我们又把美帝国主义打得头破血流。美帝国主义是我们手下的败兵，是纸老虎。
    今天，美帝国主义这只疯狗又向六亿中国人民挑衅了，我们再不能容忍。我们随时等待着祖国的召唤：走出课堂，拿起枪杆，重返前线，坚决把美国强盗消灭在台湾海峡。
            北京大学历史系　张秀全等七人
    正当中国人民在进行史无前例的大规模和平建设的时候，美帝国主义公然调集武装部队，扩大对我国的侵略，直接威胁亚洲和世界的和平。我们对美帝国主义这一战争挑衅感到无比愤怒。
    台湾和澎湖列岛，自古以来就是中国领土不可分割的一部分，中国人民解放这些地方是中国的内政问题，决不准任何帝国主义者干涉。我们完全拥护周总理的声明，一定要解放台湾。美国军队必须从台湾滚出去。
    我们都是刚刚吻别了保卫和平的武器而转到科学院工作的战士，对军事武器并未有丝毫的生疏，现在我们时刻警惕和准备着，只要祖国一声令下，我们将立即奔赴战斗的最前线，重新拿起武器，给帝国主义者以致命的打击。最后我们警告美国侵略者：如果你们胆敢向六亿中国人民开火，那你们就别想再转回去，台湾海峡的鱼腹，就是你们的“安乐室”。
