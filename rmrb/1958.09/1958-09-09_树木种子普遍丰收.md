From the Reader

　　Tree Seed Bumper Harvest
According to key investigation materials from Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan and other provinces, this year, seeds of pine, fir, cypress, sassafras, ailanthus, maple, oil tea, tung oil, as well as mountain apricot, chestnut and other tree species have generally had bumper harvests. In the past, the highest annual collection of sassafras seeds in the south was less than 100,000 jin, far from meeting the needs. This year, Changde Prefecture in Hunan alone can collect 100,000 jin. Acorn seeds account for the largest proportion of the total seed collection, and the fruiting situation this year is generally good. The number of larch, red pine, amur corktree, and Manchurian ash seeds in Northeast China is also better than in previous years.
Forestry seeds are the material basis for greening. Forestry departments estimate that this autumn, the country needs to collect more than 1.3 billion jin of seeds to meet the needs of afforestation. Now is the season when various forest tree seeds mature one after another. All localities must seize the opportunity, mobilize the masses to conduct seed source surveys, and organize seed collection work.

　　树木种子普遍丰收
    据河北、河南、山东、江苏、湖北、湖南等省的重点调查材料，今年松、杉、柏木、檫木、臭椿、枫杨、油茶、油桐以及山杏、板栗等树种种子普遍丰收。南方檫木种子过去最高年采集量不到十万斤，远远不能满足需要，今年仅湖南常德一个专区就可采种十万斤。橡子类种子在采种总数量中所占比重最大，今年结实情况一般良好。东北地区的落叶松、红松、黄波罗、水曲柳结实数量亦较往年要好。
    林木种子是绿化的物质基础。林业部门估计今秋全国要采种十三亿多斤，才能满足造林的需要。现在正是各种林木种子相继成熟的季节。各地要抓紧时机，发动群众进行种源调查组织采种工作。
