The farmland water conservancy construction since last winter has played a significant role in this year's flood control and drought resistance efforts, reducing the area affected by disasters, mitigating the severity of disasters, and reducing grain losses by approximately 30 to 40 billion jin. It has begun to create the possibility of agricultural production being able to basically avoid general water and drought disasters, enabling relatively stable development of agricultural production. The great victory of water conservancy construction and flood control and drought resistance struggles has not only strengthened the belief of the broad masses of farmers in the idea that man can conquer nature, but also demonstrated a great communist spirit in the large-scale cooperation that broke down barriers between communes, townships, counties, and even provinces. Bringing one's own tools and rations to the mountainous areas for soil and water conservation, going to other places to build reservoirs, dig wells, repair canals, open waterways, carry water to fight drought, etc., are all concrete manifestations of a great communist style. These facts fully prove that strengthening Party leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, unified planning, comprehensive management, implementing the "three self" policy, and resolutely relying on the masses are the basic keys to doing a good job in farmland water conservancy construction.

Since last winter, the irrigated area has been expanded by 450 million mu, plus the original irrigated area, totaling 970 million mu, accounting for 57 percent of the existing cultivated land, and more than one-third of the world's existing irrigated area. As long as we work hard for two more winters and two more springs, it is entirely possible to basically complete the water conservancy development of the nation's existing cultivated land. The tasks and specific plans for farmland water conservancy construction in 1959 have already been deployed by the Ministry of Agriculture in the Xiangyang Conference (Southern 12 provinces and regions) and the Zhengzhou Conference (Northern provinces and regions) held in May and June respectively. It is planned to expand the irrigated area by 490 million mu, manage waterlogging area of 72.81 million mu in 1959, with a preliminary estimate of 96.1 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work. After these two conferences, all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have begun to take action, much earlier than last year. The plans made by various localities are generally higher than the plans of the two conferences, and the earth and stone works have exceeded 100 billion cubic meters. It can be predicted that the water conservancy construction this winter and next spring will far exceed the achievements of last winter and this spring. In order to better complete the planning of farmland water conservancy projects, the following opinions are put forward:

	(1)	Policy Issues: In implementing the "small-scale as the main, storage as the main, commune-run as the main" three self policy, it should be noted that on the premise of small-scale projects as the foundation, appropriately develop medium-sized projects and necessary possible large-scale projects, and make large, medium, and small projects mutually combine, and gradually form a relatively complete water conservancy project system in a planned way. Experience has proven that small-scale projects are the basis for cultivating water sources and protecting large and medium-sized projects. Only through small-scale projects can the role of large and medium-sized projects be brought into play in farmland irrigation. Only a complete water conservancy project system with small-scale as the foundation, the combination of large, medium, and small projects, and the mutual use of surface water and groundwater can most effectively and maximize the benefits of water conservancy projects, and also have the possibility to resist major drought and flood disasters, and achieve stable and abundant harvests in agricultural production. When building water conservancy projects, whether they are small-scale projects, medium-sized projects, or general large-scale projects, it must rely mainly on the strength of the masses, supplemented by national assistance, and should also implement storage as the main, to achieve the purpose of fully and comprehensively utilizing water resources. Strive for farmland irrigation, hydropower generation, and shipping to be combined as much as possible, and rural small hydropower generation should be developed in a planned way.

	(2)	Planning Issues: In addition to the planning work carried out in various regions, the longer-term water conservancy planning for the whole country, first of all, the planning that takes the diversion of water from the south (mainly the Yangtze River system) to the north as the main purpose, and connects the Huaihe, Yellow, Han, and Haihe river basins into a unified water conservancy system, and the planning that connects the Songhua and Liaohe river basins into a unified water conservancy system, should be accelerated.

	(3)	Methods to Solve Water Conservancy Problems in Different Regions: Years of experience have provided us with different methods to solve water conservancy problems in different regions. These methods are roughly: (1) Plain and low-lying waterlogged areas should implement a river network system like the Huaibei area of Anhui, or refer to and apply the experience of transforming depressions like Tianjin, Hebei. (2) Mountainous, semi-mountainous, and hilly plateau areas should implement water storage on the mountains, soil and water conservation, comprehensive management of mountainous areas, plains, and depressions, diverting water up the mountains and plateaus, opening up hillside canals, and even opening up mountain canals like the Yintao project to solve mountain water conservancy problems like Wushan, Gansu, Xiangyang, Hubei, and Manghe, Henan. (3) For areas with severe seepage, such as the Hexi area of Gansu near the desert, the main task is to build a large number of reservoirs, line canals, eliminate seepage, and also fully intercept and utilize snow water to ensure irrigation. (4) In areas with soil erosion, it is necessary to implement a combination of engineering measures and biological measures, actively promote the experiences of Daquanshan in Shanxi and Yuxian in Henan, dig fish-scale pits, contour trenches, build gully dams, mountain ponds, and reservoirs, as well as plant trees and grass, close hillsides for afforestation, and terrace cultivated land. Through these measures, the goal of water storage and soil conservation can be achieved. (5) While constructing farmland water conservancy, we should actively carry out land leveling to achieve a combination of construction and utilization. The above-mentioned methods should be applied and developed by various localities according to local conditions.

	(4)	Strengthen Tool Reform: To equip all transportation tools with ball bearings is a key to overcoming labor shortages, improving work efficiency, and completing tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas. In the water conservancy construction campaign last winter and this spring, there have been many inventions and creations. These effective improved tools must be promoted and popularized to every construction site, and further improved on the basis of universal promotion. In the excavation of earth and stone works, attention should be paid to improving operating techniques, such as the loosening blasting method and directional blasting method. Recently, the Yintao construction site in Gansu Province used the loosening blasting method to increase the average daily earth and stone volume per person to 40 cubic meters, and the high-volume typical cases reached more than 1,000 cubic meters of stone and more than 1,500 cubic meters of earth. This shows that improving operating techniques is another key to improving labor efficiency. As long as we grasp these two keys of tool improvement and improved operating techniques, it is possible to complete the huge task of water conservancy construction ahead of schedule and exceed quotas.

Strengthening Party leadership and carrying forward the spirit of communist cooperation since last winter is the basic key to successfully completing the water conservancy construction campaign in 1959. We should earnestly summarize the experience of the water conservancy construction campaign since last winter, and based on the results of the heavy rain during this year's flood season and the severe drought in last winter, this spring, summer and autumn, draw correct experiences and lessons, carefully study the planned water conservancy projects that have been drafted, and review, modify and supplement them, so as to better complete the water conservancy construction work this winter and next spring.

    中共中央关于水利工作的指示
    一九五八年八月二十九日
    去冬以来的农田水利建设，在今年防汛抗旱斗争中，发挥了巨大作用，缩小了成灾面积，减轻了灾害程度，减少了粮食损失约三百亿斤到四百亿斤，开始创造了农业生产能够基本上避免一般水旱灾害的可能，使农业生产能够比较稳定的发展。水利建设和防汛抗旱斗争的巨大胜利，不仅坚定了广大农民人定胜天的信念，而且在打破社界、乡界、县界以至省界的大协作中，发挥了伟大的共产主义精神。自带工具口粮无偿地进入山区进行水土保持，到外地去兴修水库、打机井、修渠道、开运河、挑水抗旱等等，这些都是伟大共产主义风格的具体表现。这些事实充分证明：加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，统一规划，全面治理，贯彻“三主”方针，坚决依靠群众，是做好农田水利建设工作的基本关键。
    去冬以来已扩大灌溉面积四亿五千万亩，加上原有灌溉面积共达九亿七千万亩，占现有耕地的百分之五十七，占全世界现有灌溉面积三分之一以上。只要再苦战两冬两春，全国现有耕地，基本上完成水利化是完全可能的。一九五九年农田水利建设的任务和具体规划，已由农业部在五、六月份分别召开了襄阳会议（南方十二省、区），郑州会议（北方各省、区）作了部署，拟定一九五九年扩大灌溉面积四亿九千万亩，治涝面积七千二百八十一万亩，初步拟做的土石方九百六十一亿公方。这两个会议之后，各省、市、区都已开始行动，时间比去年提早很多，各地所作出的规划，一般都高于两个会议的规划，土石方工程已超过了一千亿公方，可以预计，今冬明春的水利建设将远远超过去冬今春的成绩。为着更好地完成兴修农田水利工程的规划，特提出如下意见：
    （一）方针问题：在贯彻执行“小型为主，以蓄为主，社办为主”的三主方针时，应该注意到在以小型工程为基础的前提下，适当地发展中型工程和必要的可能的某些大型工程，并使大、中、小工程相互结合，有计划的逐渐形成为比较完整的水利工程系统。经验证明：小型工程是培养水源和保护大、中工程的基础，也只有通过小型工程才能在农田灌溉上发挥大、中型工程的作用。只有以小型为基础，大、中、小工程互相结合的地上水地下水互相为用的完整的水利工程系统，才能最有效的和最大限度地发挥水利工程的效益，也才有可能抵抗较大的旱涝灾害，达到农业生产稳定丰收。在兴修水利工程时，不论是小型工程，中型工程或一般的大型工程，必须是依靠群众力量为主，国家援助为辅，并且应当实行以蓄为主，达到充分地综合利用水利资源的目的。力求农田灌溉，水利发电，船运，尽可能互相结合，对于农村小型水力发电，应有计划的发展。
    （二）规划问题：除了各地区进行的规划工作外，全国范围的较长远的水利规划，首先是以南水（主要是长江水系）北调为主要目的的即将江、淮、河、汉、海河各流域联系为统一的水利系统的规划，和将松、辽各流域联系为统一的水利系统的规划，应即加速制订。
    （三）解决不同地区水利问题的办法：多年来的经验，为我们提供了不同地区解决水利的不同办法。这些办法大体是：（1）平原和低洼易涝地区，应像安徽淮北地区那样实行河网化，或参考运用河北天津那样洼地改造的经验。（2）山区、半山区和丘陵高原地区，应像甘肃武山、湖北襄阳、河南漭河那样实行山上蓄水，水土保持，山区、平原、洼地全面治理，引水上山、上塬，开盘山渠道以至像引洮工程那样，开辟山上运河，解决山区水利。（3）渗漏严重地区，如甘肃河西接近沙漠地区，主要是大量修筑水库，衬砌渠道，消除渗漏，并要充分拦蓄和利用雪水，保证灌溉。（4）水土流失地区，都必须实行工程措施和生物措施相结合的办法，积极推广山西大泉山，河南禹县的经验，挖鱼鳞坑、水平沟、修建谷坊、山塘、水库，以及种树种草，封山育林，耕地梯田化等，经过这些措施，达到蓄水保土。（5）在兴修农田水利的同时，应积极进行平整土地，达到兴修与利用结合。上述各项办法，各地应因地制宜地加以运用和发展。
    （四）加强工具改革：要使所有的运输工具都装上滚珠轴承，这是克服劳力不足，提高工效，提前和超额完成任务的一个关键。在去冬今春的兴修水利运动中，已有许多发明创造，这些有效的改良工具必须推广和普及到每一个工地上去，在普遍推广的基础上进一步的加以改良。在开挖土石方工程中，应注意提高操作技术，如松动爆破法，定向爆破法等。最近甘肃省引洮工地利用松动爆破法，把每人每日平均土、石方提高到了四十公方，高额典型达石方一千方以上，土方达一千五百方以上。由此说明操作技术的提高，是提高劳动效率另一个关键。只要抓紧了工具改良和提高操作技术这两个关键，兴修水利工程的巨大任务，就有可能提前和超额完成。
    加强党的领导，发扬去冬以来的共产主义大协作精神是顺利完成一九五九年兴修水利运动的基本关键。应认真总结去冬以来兴修水利运动的经验，并根据今年汛期暴雨以及去冬今春和夏秋大旱考验的结果，得出正确的经验教训，细心地研究已拟定的兴修水利工程的规划，经过审查加以修改和补充，以便更完善地做好今冬明春的水利建设工作。
