    Chinese Students Studying in the Soviet Union Express Resolve to Quickly Master Advanced Technology and Build a Stronger Motherland
    Recently, American imperialism has attempted to expand its aggression against our country in the Taiwan region, instigating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to continuously carry out armed provocations against our country. Dulles has even openly threatened our country with war rhetoric. We feel boundless anger towards this! Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other coastal islands have been our territory since ancient times. Liberating Taiwan and unifying the motherland is the sacred and inviolable right of the Chinese people.
    We resolutely support the solemn statement issued by Premier Zhou on behalf of our government. The Chinese people have every right to liberate our territory of Taiwan at an appropriate time and by appropriate means, and no foreign country is allowed to interfere. We will study diligently, master advanced Soviet science and technology, and, together with the 600 million people of our motherland, strive to build our country into a great socialist power in the shortest possible time, and be ready at all times to contribute our strength to the liberation of Taiwan.

                September 8, 1958
    The 1,700 Chinese students studying in Leningrad held a rally on September 14 to support the government's statement against American aggression. When we learned from newspapers and broadcasts about the shameless acts of American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait region to invade our country and disrupt peace, everyone felt immense anger. We love peace and oppose war; however, if American imperialism dares to undermine our peaceful construction and ignite the flames of war, we will not be afraid of war. We solemnly warn American imperialism: the Chinese people's determination to liberate their own territories of Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan is unshakable. If American imperialism dares to interfere in our internal affairs by force, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the invaders!
    Our struggle is not isolated; our friends are all over the world. Studying in the Soviet Union, we deeply appreciate the great Soviet Union's support for us. Let the American paper tiger tremble before the great united strength of the peace-loving people of the world! If American imperialism continues its war provocations, then the people of the world will surely sentence it to the gallows!
    We, all the international students, solemnly swear to the Party and to the Motherland: We will redouble our efforts to study and successfully complete the tasks assigned to us by the Motherland. We will use our academic achievements to strike at the invaders and stand ready to respond to the call of the Motherland at any time, take up arms, rush to the battlefield, resolutely defend the Motherland, liberate Taiwan, and eliminate American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait!
    All International Students in Leningrad

    留苏中国学生表示
    要迅速掌握先进技术
    把祖国建设得更强大
    最近，美帝国主义企图在台湾地区扩大对我国的侵略，唆使蒋介石卖国集团不断地对我国进行武装挑衅，杜勒斯还公开地以战争叫嚣来威胁我国，对此我们感到无比的愤怒！台湾、澎湖列岛，以及其他沿海岛屿，自古就是我国的领土。解放台湾，统一祖国是中国人民神圣不可侵犯的权利。
    我们坚决拥护周总理代表我国政府所发表的严正声明，中国人民完全有权利用一切适当的手段，在适当的时间解放我国领土台湾，不许任何外国加以干涉。我们将顽强学习，掌握苏联先进科学技术，和六亿祖国人民一道，为把我国在最短期间内建设成为一个伟大的社会主义强国而奋斗，并时刻准备着为解放台湾而贡献出我们的力量。
            莫斯科动力学院全体中国研究生和进修教师
                1958年9月8日
    我们在列宁格勒学习的一千七百名留苏学生，于9月14日举行了拥护政府声明反对美国侵略的大会。当我们从报纸上，广播里知道美帝国主义无耻地在台湾海峡地区进行侵略我国、破坏和平的勾当后，每一个人都感到无比愤怒。我们热爱和平，反对战争；但是，如果美帝国主义胆敢破坏我们的和平建设，燃起战火，我们也决不害怕战争。我们严正警告美帝国主义：中国人民解放自己的领土金门、马祖和台湾的决心是不可动摇的，如果美帝国主义敢于武装干涉我国内政，我们就要把侵略者坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭掉！
    我们的斗争并不孤立，我们的朋友遍于全世界。我们在苏联学习，就更深刻地体会到伟大苏联对我们的支持。让美国纸老虎在世界爱好和平的伟大团结力量面前发抖吧！如果美帝国主义继续它的战争挑衅，那么全世界人民就一定要把它处以绞刑！
    我们全体留学生向党、向祖国庄严地宣誓：我们要加倍努力学习，出色地完成祖国交给我们的任务，用我们的学习成绩打击侵略者。并且时刻准备着响应祖国的号召，拿起武器，奔向战场，坚决保卫祖国，解放台湾，把美帝国主义消灭在台湾海峡！
    列宁格勒全体留学生
                1958年9月14日
