Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: American provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait region have not only been severely condemned by world justice opinion, but have also aroused strong unease in Western countries. Many newspapers in Western countries have recently published commentaries, pointing out that the US provocation against China is an unpopular act, which will bring serious consequences to the United States, and require their governments not to support the US aggression. From these comments, we can see how isolated the American aggressors are.

    The British "Daily Mirror" says:
    Dulles is dreaming if he wants to get support from "allies"
    The British "Daily Mirror's" September 11 editorial reminded Dulles that if he really believed that America's allies would support the US position on the current Far East crisis as he said, then "he is living in a dream." "The overwhelming majority of the British public will not tolerate this country (Britain) being involved in a war with China for these islands. The British public is not interested in maintaining Chiang Kai-shek's indecent regime. The British public wants Communist China to obtain its rightful place in the United Nations." The newspaper demanded that "Mr. Macmillan must quickly warn the United States: Britain is also opposed to reckless adventures in the Far East."
    The "Liverpool Post" published an editorial on September 10, warning the United States that if a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait region, "it seems that of all the edges that Mr. Dulles has put himself on, this one is the most dangerous for himself and the world." The editorial also pointed out that it would be "tragic" if Britain got involved in this dispute.
    The "Manchester Guardian" also pointed out the serious danger of US warships conducting provocative activities in the Taiwan Strait region. The newspaper specifically pointed out: "The Soviet satellite and the Korean War have warned the American people: their country is not invincible and cannot be breached."
    "The Scotsman" said that Dulles had put the United States in a dangerous situation where it could easily be dragged into war. The newspaper emphasized that this situation would never be welcomed by America's allies.

    The French "Le Monde" says:
    Dulles is leading the United States down a dangerous path
    The French "Le Monde" published an editorial on September 9, condemning the US policy of aggression against the People's Republic of China. The article pointed out that now "it is almost universally recognized that the coastal islands of China belong to China."
    "Le Monde" pointed out that Secretary of State Dulles "is still practicing brinkmanship." The newspaper emphasized that the United States is embarking on a "dangerous path." The newspaper believes that the development of the situation requires the United States to quickly revise its Far East policy.

    West German "Telegraph" says:
    The United States must change its attitude towards Beijing
    The influential Hamburg "Die Welt" of West Germany said in a commentary on the US policy towards China on September 9 that no one denies that the US policy is unrealistic. The newspaper said, "For several years, China has become a representative of freedom in Asia, that is, freedom from hunger, freedom from unimaginable spiritual and material poverty, and freedom from unrestricted exploitation and bondage by people of another lighter skin color."
    The "Telegraph" in West Berlin pointed out on the 7th that the way to ease the tension in the Far East and save the world from the "brink of war" is that "the United States should first change its attitude towards Beijing. Washington must see that the representative of China can no longer be Chiang Kai-shek but Mao Zedong... Accepting China into the United Nations and letting Beijing replace Taipei's representative in the Security Council should be the first step."

    Norwegian "Free Struggle" says:
    The US attitude towards China threatens world peace
    Many Norwegian newspapers have firmly condemned the US policy of war provocation against the People's Republic of China. The Labor Party's organ "Workers' Daily" published an article emphasizing that the situation created by the US actions in the Taiwan Strait is a dangerous situation maintained on the "brink of war."
    The Labor Party Youth Organization's organ "Free Struggle" demanded in an editorial that the United States be forced to change its policy towards China. The editorial said, "The recent situation in the Taiwan Strait clearly shows that the US attitude towards the People's China once again puts international peace in danger." The newspaper firmly demanded the restoration of the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

    Swedish "Stockholm Daily" says:
    The US current practices are even less justified than the British and French aggression against Egypt
    The Swedish "Stockholm Daily" criticized the US military provocative actions against China on September 10. The newspaper said that it is "undoubted" on which side the majority of Western European public opinion stands on in the dispute over the Taiwan issue. It pointed out that many people believe that the US current practices are even less justified than the British and French intervention in Suez that year.

    Canadian "Financial Post" says:
    Uncle Sam stretches his nose too far and it is not good for him
    The Canadian "Forum" on September 8 reprinted an article from the Canadian big business mouthpiece "Financial Post" (weekly) on August 30, entitled: "Uncle Sam stretches his nose too far and it is not good for him."
    The article said: If the United States gets involved in a war over the Chinese islands of Jinmen and Matsu, its reasons for sending troops are unpopular. Because the Jinmen and Matsu issues are deliberately created by the US ambition to maintain a base on the coast of the communist world.
    The article said: The two small rocky islands of Jinmen and Matsu, only a few nautical miles from the Chinese coast, were occupied by Chiang Kai-shek under US instigation and fortified there. The openly admitted reason is that these islands will be Chiang Kai-shek's springboard for "recovering" China—a dream of a patient that has long been shattered.
    Now the Chinese Communists are taking steps to eliminate the threat at their door. It is complete nonsense to call this aggression. The article said: Today's world is too small and too dangerous for violent behavior in international affairs. The Americans are asking for trouble by trying to establish a military base on the Chinese coast.
    The article said: Neither heaven nor mankind has assigned the United States the task of ruling all the rest of the world. Uncle Sam's nose is stretched too far and it is not good for him.

    Australian "Sydney Morning Herald" says:
    If the United States attacks China, it will definitely fight alone
    The Australian "Sydney Morning Herald" said that if the United States attacks People's China for the islands of Jinmen and Matsu, it will definitely fight alone. The newspaper said that such a war is unpopular in the United States and will cause non-aligned countries to oppose it with "overwhelming force." The newspaper emphasized that the Western position on Jinmen and Matsu is "untenable."
    "The Sun" criticized the United States for bringing the West to the current dangerous edge in an editorial. It believes that no one is worth sacrificing their lives for these islands.
    The "Sunday Telegraph" questioned whether the United States is not "completely crazy" to bring the world to the brink of war for the islands of Jinmen and Matsu? It asked, "Who wants to die for Matsu?" The newspaper called on the United States to "have a very careful consideration" before taking further action.

    Argentine "The Times" says:
    The United States cannot obliterate the existence of the largest country in the world
    The Argentine "The Times" published an editorial on September 3, criticizing the US policy of provocation against China.
    The editorial said, "While the Chiang Kai-shek puppet group is carrying out sinful provocations against the People's Republic of China, the US Seventh Fleet is flexing its muscles in the Chinese territorial waters of the Taiwan Strait." This shows the "aggressive" nature of the US policy towards that great Eastern republic.
    The editorial also condemned the US hostile attitude towards the legitimate government of China. It said: "How can one obliterate the existence of the most populous and largest country on earth, how can one close one's eyes to the fact that its 600 million residents are living a real life, how can one insist that the world will follow the United States in recognizing Chiang Kai-shek who is placed on a small coastal island?"
    The editorial called on the Argentine government to recognize the government of the People's Republic of China. It said that the recognition of the Chiang Kai-shek group is intolerable, "just as we would not tolerate the day when a certain country would regard and recognize the government of the Malvinas Islands as the Argentine government, because the Malvinas Islands are Argentine, just as Taiwan is Chinese. This situation cannot continue."

### 西方舆论反对美国在远东玩火

    西方舆论反对美国在远东玩火
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国在台湾海峡地区的挑衅行为，不但受到世界正义舆论的严正谴责，而且也引起了西方国家舆论的强烈不安。西方国家的很多报纸最近纷纷发表评论，指出美国向中国挑衅是不得人心的做法，将会给美国带来严重的后果，并且要求本国政府不要支持美国的侵略行动。从这些评论中，可以看到美国侵略者目前的处境是何等的孤立。
    英国“每日镜报”说：
    杜勒斯想得到“盟国”支持完全是做梦
    英国“每日镜报”11日的社论提醒杜勒斯注意，如果他真的相信美国的盟国会像他所说的那样支持美国在目前远东危机问题上的立场，那“他就是生活在梦乡之中”。“英国压倒多数的公众将不能容忍这个国家（英国）卷入为了这些岛屿而同中国进行的战争中。英国公众对维持蒋介石的不体面的政权不感兴趣。英国公众希望共产党中国取得在联合国中的正当地位。”这家报纸要求，“麦克米伦先生必须赶紧警告美国：英国也反对在远东的疯狂冒险。”
    “利物浦邮报”10日发表社论警告美国说，如果在台湾海峡地区爆发战争，“看来，在杜勒斯先生使自己所处的所有边缘中，这一次对他本人和世界来说都是最危险的边缘”。社论还指出，如果英国卷入这场纷争中那将是“悲惨的”。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”也指出美国军舰在台湾海峡地区进行挑衅活动的严重危险性。这家报纸特别指出：“苏联的人造卫星和朝鲜战争已经对美国人民提出警告：他们的国家并不是不可战胜的，也不是攻不破的。”
    “苏格兰人报”说，杜勒斯已经把美国置于很容易卷入战争的危险境地。报纸强调指出，这种局面绝不会受到美国盟国的欢迎。
    法国“世界报”说：
    杜勒斯使美国走上危险的道路
    法国“世界报”9日发表社论，谴责美国对中华人民共和国的侵略政策。文章中指出，现在“差不多各地都不否认中国沿海岛屿是属于中国的”。
    “世界报”指出，国务卿杜勒斯“仍然实行着深渊边缘的政策”。报纸强调指出，美国走上了一条“危险的道路”。报纸认为，事态的发展使美国必须迅速修改它的远东政策。
    西德“电讯报”说：
    美国必须改变对北京的态度
    西德有影响的汉堡“世界报”9日在评论美国对中国的政策时说，没有人否认美国的政策是不现实的，这家报纸说，“几年来中国在亚洲已经成了一种自由的代表，这就是免除饥饿的自由，免除难以想像的精神和物质贫困的自由，以及免除被另一种肤色较浅的人进行无限制剥削和束缚的自由。”
    西柏林的“电讯报”在7日指出，缓和远东紧张局势并且把世界从“战争边缘”解救出来的办法，是“美国应该首先改变它对北京的态度。华盛顿必须看到代表中国的不能再是蒋介石而是毛泽东……接受中国加入联合国，让北京在安全理事会中代替台北的代表，应该是第一个步骤”。
    挪威“自由斗争报”说：
    美国对中国的态度威胁世界和平
    许多挪威报纸坚决谴责美国对中华人民共和国的战争挑衅政策。工党机关报“工人日报”发表文章强调指出，美国在台湾海峡的行动所造成的局势是一种保持在“战争边缘”上的危险局势。
    工党青年组织的机关报“自由斗争报”在社论中要求迫使美国改变它对中国的政策。社论说，“台湾海峡最近的事态十分清楚地表明，美国对人民中国的态度再一次地使国际和平面临着危险。”报纸坚决要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位。
    瑞典“斯德哥尔摩日报”说：
    美国目前做法比英法侵略埃及还要理亏
    瑞典“斯德哥尔摩日报”10日抨击美国对中国进行军事挑衅的行为。这家报纸说，在台湾问题的争端中，西欧舆论的多数究竟站在哪一边是“毫无疑问”的。它指出，不少人认为，美国目前的做法甚至比当年英法干涉苏伊士的行动还要理亏。
    加拿大“金融邮报”说：
    山姆大叔把鼻子伸得太长对自己不利
    9月8日的加拿大“论坛报”转载了加拿大大企业喉舌“金融邮报”（周刊）8月30日的一篇文章，题目是：“山姆大叔把鼻子伸得太长了而对自己不利”。
    文章说：如果美国在中国岛屿金门和马祖问题上卷入了战争，它出兵的理由是不得人心的。因为金门和马祖问题是由于美国野心勃勃地要在共产党世界的海岸边保有一个基地而故意制造出来的。
    文章说：距离中国海岸只有几浬的两个小小的多岩岛屿金门和马祖被蒋介石在美国怂恿下占据并在那里构筑工事。公开承认的理由是，这些岛屿将是蒋介石“收复”中国的跳板——这是一个早已破灭的病人的梦想。
    现在中国共产党人正在采取步骤来消除自己大门口的威胁。把这称为侵略完全是胡说八道。文章说：要在国际事务中要强暴行为，今日的世界是太小了，也是太危险了。美国人试图在中国海岸上建立军事基地，这是自找麻烦。
    文章说：不论苍天或者人类都没有委派美国统治世界所有其余地方的任务。山姆大叔的鼻子伸得太长了而对自己不利。
    澳大利亚“悉尼先驱晨报”说：
    美国如进攻中国肯定要孤军作战
    澳大利亚“悉尼先驱晨报”说，美国如果为了金门和马祖这些岛屿进攻人民中国，它肯定要孤军作战。这家报纸说，这样的战争在美国国内不得人心，并且会使不参加集团的国家以“压倒的力量”来反对它。这家报纸强调指出，西方对金门和马祖的立场是“站不住脚的”。
    “太阳报”在社论中指责美国把西方带到目前的危险边缘。它认为任何一个人都不值得为了这些岛屿而牺牲性命。
    “星期日电讯报”质问美国为了金门和马祖这些岛屿而把世界带到战争边缘，难道不是“完全疯狂了吗？”它问道，“谁愿意为马祖而死呢？”这家报纸要求美国在采取进一步行动之前“有必要进行非常慎重的考虑”。
    阿根廷“时报”说：
    美国无法抹杀世上最大国家的存在
    阿根廷“时报”3日发表社论，抨击美国对中国的挑衅政策。
    社论说，“在蒋介石傀儡集团向中华人民共和国进行罪恶的挑衅的同时，美国第七舰队正在台湾海峡的中国领海内耀武扬威”。这表明了美国对待那个伟大东方共和国的政策的“富于侵略性。”
    这篇社论还谴责美国对中国合法政府的敌视态度。它说：“人们怎能抹煞地球上人口最多的最大的国家的存在呢，怎能闭目不看它的六亿居民过着真正生活的事实，怎能硬说世界将效法美国而承认被安置在小小沿海岛屿上的蒋介石呢？”
    社论要求阿根廷政府承认中华人民共和国政府。它说，承认蒋介石集团之不能容忍，“恰如我们不会容忍某一天某一国竟然把马耳维内斯群岛的政府看作而且承认为阿根廷政府，因为马耳维内斯群岛是阿根廷的，正如台湾是中国的一样。这种情况决不能继续下去”。
