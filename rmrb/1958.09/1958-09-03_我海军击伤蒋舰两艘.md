Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 2nd. Our People's Liberation Army's Fujian Front naval units hit and damaged two U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek military ships on the 1st.
	At 21:26 on the night of the same day, four U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek ships, including a Yong-class patrol ship, a Jiang-class gunboat, and an Mei-class landing ship, carried Chiang's troops and combat materials from Makung to Kinmen. Our People's Liberation Army naval gunboat units and torpedo boat units immediately braved force five or higher winds, heroically went out to sea and fiercely attacked the enemy ships head-on. The Chiang Kai-shek Jiang-class gunboat was seriously damaged by us, and the Yong-class patrol ship was also hit by us, and fled in panic to the sea.
