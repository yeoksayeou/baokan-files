Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 23rd: Ganev, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Secretary of the Central Committee, condemned the military provocations and war threats of U.S. imperialism against China in the Taiwan Strait area during a speech at a conference held in Razlog on the 22nd. He expressed his complete belief that the Chinese people would definitely be able to complete the cause of unifying their motherland.

This conference was held to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Bulgarian people's armed uprising against the fascist regime in September 1923.

In his speech at the conference, Ganev pointed out that the whole world is now seeing the new mad adventures of the U.S. imperialists in the Far East. Even the closest allies of the United States refuse to support the U.S. He said that the situation in the Far East is indeed serious. The U.S. imperialists are rudely interfering in China's internal affairs, intimidating China with airplanes and warships. However, China is not Lebanon, Jordan, or Cuba. New China is a strong country in the world, and it has loyal allies behind it.

Ganev said: We can say with full confidence that the Chinese people will definitely be able to complete the cause of unifying their great motherland. If anyone uses force against the Chinese people, the Chinese people will give the invaders a powerful counterattack.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 23rd: Mikhailov, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Minister of National Defense, said at a meeting of residents in Mikhailovgrad on the 23rd celebrating the 35th anniversary of the anti-fascist people's uprising that the Bulgarian people resolutely advocate stopping the shameless aggression of U.S. imperialism against China, and that the U.S. armed forces should immediately withdraw from the Taiwan area and let the Chinese people arrange their own affairs.

He continued, any infringement on China by U.S. imperialism means an infringement and provocation against the Soviet Union, the entire socialist camp, and all peace-loving humanity. There is no doubt that this aggressive provocation will be met with a devastating blow. The imperialist war maniacs should understand that whoever violates the will of the people of all countries and does not let them live in peace will be crushed by the wheel of history.

In the past few days, mass rallies have been widely held throughout Bulgaria to commemorate the September 9th anti-fascist uprising, a day of great historical significance in the history of the Bulgarian revolution. Leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government attended celebrations in various places and met with participants in the uprising.

    加涅夫和米哈伊洛夫支持我国斗争
    战争狂人必被历史车轮辗碎
    据新华社索非亚23日电  保加利亚共产党中央政治局委员、中央书记加涅夫，22日在拉兹罗格市举行的一次大会上讲话时，谴责美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区对中国进行的军事挑衅和战争威胁。他表示完全相信，中国人民一定能够完成统一祖国的事业。
    这次大会是为庆祝1923年9月保加利亚人民反法西斯政权武装起义三十五周年而举行的。
    加涅夫在大会上讲话时指出，现在全世界都看到美帝国主义者在远东进行的新的疯狂冒险。美国最亲近的盟友都拒绝支持美国。他说，的确，远东地区的局势是严重的。美帝国主义者粗暴地干涉中国内政，用飞机和军舰恫吓中国。但是，中国不是黎巴嫩，不是约旦或古巴。新中国是世界上的强国，而且在它的背后有着忠实的盟友。
    加涅夫说：我们可以满怀信心地说，中国人民一定能够完成统一伟大祖国的事业。如果有人用强力对待中国人民，中国人民就会给侵略者以有力的反击。
    据新华社索非亚23日电  保加利亚共产党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席、国防部部长米哈伊洛夫23日在米海洛夫格勒市居民庆祝反法西斯人民起义三十五周年集会上说，保加利亚人民坚决主张停止美帝国主义对中国的无耻侵略，美国武装力量应立即从台湾地区撤出去，让中国人民自己来安排自己的事情。
    他继续说，美帝国主义对中国的任何侵犯，都意味着是对苏联、整个社会主义阵营及全体爱好和平人类的侵犯和挑衅。毫无疑问，这种侵略性的挑衅必将遭到毁灭性的打击。帝国主义战争狂人应该明白，谁要是违反各国人民的意志，不让他们过和平的生活，谁就要被历史车轮压得粉碎。
    几天来，保加利亚全国各地广泛举行了群众集会来纪念9月9日反法西斯起义这个在保加利亚革命史上具有重大历史意义的日子。保加利亚共产党和政府领导人分别出席了各地的庆祝集会，并会见了这次起义的参加者。
