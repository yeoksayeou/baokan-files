　　Let Stage Art and Performing Art Rival Each Other
    Literary and Art Circles in the Capital Hold Symposium on Stage Art Work
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Chinese Dramatists Association, the Chinese Artists Association, and the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera recently invited people from Beijing's drama and art circles to hold a symposium on stage art work. At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that with the development of socialist drama, stage art, and even stage art as a whole, must be comprehensively innovated accordingly.
    Innovating stage art is a new issue raised to adapt to the development of the content of dramas. Many people pointed out at the symposium that since liberation, China's stage art work has made significant achievements, but its level still lags behind the excellent performing arts of our country's dramas. This contradiction is even more prominent in traditional opera art. With the development of socialist new traditional operas with modern repertoire as the mainstream, the technological innovation of stage art has been placed on the agenda even more urgently. At present, in the stage art designs of many modern traditional opera repertoires, the traditional art can be inherited and creatively developed, thus strengthening the political and artistic effects; however, from some other modern repertoires, we can also see the neglect of the characteristics of traditional opera art and the disregard of stage art. The symposium discussed these issues and proposed specific methods for innovating stage art. The Chinese Dramatists Association, the Chinese Artists Association, and the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera decided to jointly hold a stage art exhibition and experience exchange meeting at the end of this year, publish a stage art work yearbook, and prepare to select some theaters and troupes in Beijing and other places to carry out key demonstration work on stage art innovation. This symposium also hopes that artists can pay attention to this work and directly participate in stage art design.
    At this symposium, Tian Han, chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, said that criticisms of the phenomena of being divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, divorced from politics, extravagance and waste, as well as formalism and naturalism in stage art work, are all correct and necessary, and these biases must continue to be opposed. However, if one therefore believes that stage art, or even stage art as a whole, is dispensable, then that is wrong. He said that doing stage art work must start from the current material and technical conditions, and also see the growing demands of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for dramatic art and the possibility of rapid development of material and technical conditions. The relationship between more, faster, better, and more economical is unified, and innovating stage art does not contradict improving the political and ideological content of dramas. Advocating improving stage art is not the same thing as extravagance and waste.
    Mei Lanfang, president of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera, believes that the innovation of stage art in traditional opera is a matter of urgency. With the development of modern repertoires, stage art should also be completely renewed. In the stage art work of modern repertoires, we must be good at inheriting excellent traditional art and boldly developing and innovating it. The stage art of newly compiled historical repertoires also needs to be innovated. He pointed out that the stage art of Peking Opera must adapt to the exaggeration and concentration characteristics of the performing arts, and the costumes, props, and scenery of Peking Opera cannot be simply limited to the reality of life, but must consider its artistic effect.
    Ma Shaobo, vice president of the China National Peking Opera Company, said that stage art work in Peking Opera should grasp the principles of conciseness and concentration, and oppose both cumbersome extravagance and crude simplicity. Stage art design can also put forward different requirements according to different conditions and local conditions.
    Sun Haoran, professor of the Shanghai Theatre Academy, and stage art workers Gong Hede, Li Xin, Zhang Xuefeng, and others also spoke at the meeting.
    Hua Junwu, secretary-general of the Chinese Artists Association, and director Wang Chaowen said in a joint speech that the art circles will strongly support the innovation of stage art.

　　让舞台美术和表演艺术媲美
    首都文艺界举行舞台美术工作座谈会
    据新华社讯　中国戏剧家协会、中国美术家协会、中国戏曲研究院在最近邀请北京戏剧界、美术界人士举行舞台美术工作座谈会。会上大家一致认为，随着社会主义戏剧事业的发展，舞台美术以至舞台艺术必须相应地实行全面的革新。
    革新舞台美术，是适应戏剧内容的发展而提出的新问题。座谈会上许多人指出，解放以来，我国的舞台美术工作取得了重大的成就，但是它的水平仍然落后于我国戏剧的优秀的表演艺术。这个矛盾表现在戏曲艺术中则更为突出。随着以现代剧目为主流的社会主义新戏曲的发展，舞台美术的技术革新就更迫切地被提到议事日程上来了。目前在很多现代戏曲剧目的舞台美术设计中，能够继承传统艺术并加以创造，因而加强了政治和艺术效果；但从另外一些现代剧目中也可以看到忽视传统戏曲艺术的特点，轻视舞台美术的情况。座谈会针对这些问题进行了讨论，并且提出了革新舞台美术的具体办法。中国戏剧家协会、中国美术家协会和中国戏曲研究院决定在今年年底共同举行舞台美术展览和经验交流会，出版舞台美术工作年鉴，并准备在北京等地选择一些剧院、剧团进行舞台美术革新的重点示范工作。这次座谈会并希望美术家们能关心这一工作并直接参加舞台美术设计。
    在这次座谈会上，中国戏剧家协会主席田汉说，批判舞台美术工作中脱离群众、脱离实际、脱离政治、铺张浪费的现象以及形式主义、自然主义等偏向都做得对，都是必要的，对这些偏向必须继续加以反对。但是，如果因此而认为舞台美术以至舞台艺术可有可无，那就错了。他说，搞舞台美术工作既要从当前的物质、技术条件出发，又要看到广大工农兵观众对戏剧艺术日益增长的要求和物质、技术条件迅速发展的可能性。多快好省的关系是统一的，革新舞台美术，同提高戏剧的政治和思想内容并不矛盾。提倡提高舞台美术同铺张浪费也不是一回事。
    中国戏曲研究院院长梅兰芳认为，戏曲舞台美术的革新是刻不容缓的，随着现代剧目的发展，舞台美术也应当跟着焕然改观。在现代剧目的舞台美术工作中，必须善于继承优秀的传统艺术并加以大胆地发展和革新。新编排的历史剧目的舞台美术同样也需要革新。他指出，京剧的舞台美术必须适应表演艺术的夸张、集中等特点，京剧的服装和道具、布景不能单纯局限于生活的真实，必须考虑它的艺术效果。
    中国京剧院副院长马少波说，京剧的舞台美术工作应当掌握简练集中的原则，反对繁琐铺张和粗糙简陋。舞台美术设计，也可以根据不同的条件，因地制宜地提出不同的要求。
    上海戏剧学院教授孙浩然，以及舞台美术工作者龚和德、黎新、张雪峰等多人曾在会上发了言。
    中国美术家协会秘书长华君武、理事王朝闻在联合发言中表示，美术界将大力支持舞台美术的革新工作。
