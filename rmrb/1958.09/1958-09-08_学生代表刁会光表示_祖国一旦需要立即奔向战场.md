Student Representative Diao Huiguang Declares:
	Ready to Rush to the Battlefield the Moment the Motherland Needs Us
　　After hearing Dulles' statement of blatant interference in our country's internal affairs and open threats to expand aggression against our country, all of us students expressed extreme indignation. We, the Chinese people who have stood up, will never tolerate such frantic war provocations by U.S. imperialism.
　　We firmly support Premier Zhou's solemn statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait. This is the voice of 600 million Chinese people and a warning to U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world. We have long recognized it. This time, Dulles' clamor further exposed its ugly face. U.S. imperialism starts fires everywhere, provokes everywhere, implements its notorious "brink of war" policy, and creates international tension. Wherever the claws of U.S. imperialism extend, peace is threatened.
　　Today, the troops of U.S. imperialism have not yet withdrawn from Lebanon, and now they are creating new war dangers in the Taiwan Strait. They describe the Chinese people's struggle to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity as "aggressive military actions," while the aggressive activities of U.S. warships in the Chinese seas thousands of miles away from the United States are described as defending the security of the United States. This is truly naked pirate logic.
　　Taiwan and all coastal islands have been an inseparable part of our territory for many centuries. We have never forgotten our compatriots in Taiwan who are suffering from the enslavement and oppression of U.S. imperialism and the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique. We must liberate our compatriots in Taiwan from their suffering. In particular, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is still entrenched in Kinmen, Matsu and other coastal islands, harassing the security of our mainland. On the morning of the 6th, the Chiang bandit troops used American shells to bombard the residential area of Jiangtou Town in Xiamen City, injuring twenty-four compatriots and killing eleven, most of whom were students in class. When we saw this news, we couldn't bear it any longer. This brutal crime aroused our incomparable indignation and strengthened our determination to liberate Taiwan and all coastal islands.
　　We must liberate Taiwan and all coastal islands, and we will certainly be able to liberate Taiwan and all coastal islands. U.S. imperialism: We fought you on the Korean battlefield, and you were our defeated general. Your paper tiger has long been exposed by us. We are not afraid of you.
　　Today is the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind. Eisenhower, Dulles, you war mongers should open your eyes and see that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and people in the world are standing with us. This force has long surpassed the strength of imperialism. The era of imperialist hegemony is gone forever. Today, if you dare to invade again, the torrent of 600 million of our people and all peace-loving people in the world will wash you into the Pacific Ocean to feed the sharks.
　　We Chinese young students have a glorious revolutionary tradition of anti-imperialism and patriotism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In the "December 9th" era, students put down their books and left their classrooms to oppose Japanese imperialism and the oppression of the Kuomintang traitorous government, not hesitating to shed their blood and fight alongside the people of the whole country in the struggle to resist Japan and save the country. Today, at a time when our motherland is making great leaps forward, U.S. imperialism is provoking us again. We can no longer suppress the flames of anger in our hearts. All the students of Tsinghua University resolutely respond to the call of the Supreme State Council. Today, we have urgently mobilized and formed the Tsinghua Special Forces Combat Division to achieve military action and combat life. We are the builders of the motherland and also the heroic defenders of the motherland. As soon as the motherland calls, all our officers and soldiers will immediately pick up their guns, put on their military uniforms, leave the classroom, and rush to the battlefield, together with the people of the whole country, to resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate the invaders.
　　We must liberate Kinmen and Matsu!
　　We must liberate Taiwan!
　　American troops get out of the Taiwan area!

    学生代表刁会光表示
　　祖国一旦需要立即奔向战场
    当我们听到杜勒斯发表了粗暴干涉我国内政、公然威胁要扩大对我国的侵略范围的声明后，我们全体同学表示万分的愤慨，我们站起来的中国人民，决不能容忍美帝国主义这种疯狂的战争挑衅。
    我们坚决拥护周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的严正声明。这是六亿中国人民的声音，是对美帝国主义的警告。美帝国主义是中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平人民的最凶恶的敌人。我们早就认得了它，这一次杜勒斯的叫嚣更进一步暴露了它本来的丑恶面目。美帝国主义到处点火，处处挑衅，执行他那臭名远扬的“战争边缘”政策，制造国际紧张局势，美帝国主义的魔爪伸到哪里，哪里的和平就受到威胁。
    今天美帝国主义的军队还没有撤出黎巴嫩，又在台湾海峡地区制造新的战争危险。他们把中国人民维护自己主权和领土完整的斗争说成是“侵略性的军事行动”，把美国军舰在离美国万里以外的中国海上进行的侵略活动，反倒说成是保卫美国的安全，这真是赤裸裸的海盗逻辑。
    台湾和一切沿海岛屿，很多世纪以来就是我国领土不可分割的一部分，我们一直没有忘记遭受美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团奴役压迫的台湾地区的同胞，我们要把台湾地区的同胞由水深火热之中解放出来。特别是蒋介石卖国集团今天还盘踞在金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，骚扰我们大陆的安全，6日上午蒋匪军又用美国的炮弹轰击我们厦门市江头镇的居民区，击伤了二十四个同胞，死亡十一人，其中大多数是正在上课的学生。当我们看到这个消息，实在忍无可忍，这种残暴的罪行激起了我们无比的愤慨，更加坚定了我们解放台湾和一切沿海岛屿的决心。
    我们一定要解放台湾和一切沿海岛屿，我们也一定能够解放台湾和一切沿海岛屿。美帝国主义：我们在朝鲜战场上与你较量过，你是我们手下的败将，你这个纸老虎早已被我们戳穿了，我们不怕你。
    今天已经是东风压倒西风的时代，艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯，你们这些战争贩子们应当睁开眼睛看看了，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民都和我们站在一起，这个力量早已超过了帝国主义的力量，帝国主义称霸的时代早已一去不复返了，今天你们胆敢再来侵略，我们六亿人民和全世界爱好和平人民的洪流，就会把你冲到太平洋里去喂鲨鱼。
    我们中国的青年学生在中国共产党的领导下有着反帝爱国的光荣革命传统，“一二九”时代，同学们为了反对日本帝国主义和国民党卖国政府的压迫，放下了书本，离开了教室，不惜抛头颅，洒热血和全国人民一道，投入了抗日救国的斗争。今天正当我们祖国大跃进的时代，美帝国主义又来挑衅了，我们再也压制不住心头愤怒的火焰，我们清华大学全体同学坚决响应最高国务会议的号召，在今天我们已经紧急动员起来，组成清华特种兵战斗师，要作到行动军事化，生活战斗化。我们是祖国的建设者，也是祖国英勇的保卫者。只要一旦祖国召唤，我们全体官兵马上拿起枪杆，穿好军装，走出课堂，奔向战场，与全国人民在一起，坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭侵略者。
    我们一定要解放金门、马祖！
    我们一定要解放台湾！
    美国军队从台湾地区滚出去！
