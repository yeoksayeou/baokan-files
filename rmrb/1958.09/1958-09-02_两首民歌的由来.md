　　The Origin of Two Folk Songs
　　By our reporter Xiao Ming

　　Before June of this year, a folk song like this appeared in Majiang County, Guizhou:

　　The higher-ups have no ideas,
　　We can't plant rice seedlings in the drought,
　　There will be no harvest this year,
　t you want us to flee from famine?

　　At that time, Majiang County suffered from severe drought. The responsible comrades of the county committee did not take active drought resistance measures, but only passively hoped for rain. Therefore, the masses composed that folk song.

　　When the Secretary of the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture Committee came to inspect the work, he discovered this situation. He took the responsible comrades of the county committee to visit Danzhai, which was also threatened by drought. The Longdong River in the upper reaches of the Qingshui River is the boundary between Danzhai and Majiang. Danzhai is south of the river, and Majiang is north of the river. Because Danzhai paid attention to drought resistance, the crops grew very well.

　　After personally visiting Danzhai, the county committee comrades began to wake up. They found that just in the suburbs, the rushing water was four or five feet deep below, but the fields above were dry and cracked. Building a one-mile-long canal, or a water flume of dozens of meters, could solve the water problem for large areas of land, but no one organized or took action. Xinchang Township and many other townships in the county had planted 70% of their rice seedlings under the same drought conditions. The county committee only used these advanced township materials as reporting materials, without personally summarizing experiences and promoting comprehensive work.

　　After reviewing these thoughts, the county committee made an emergency action plan. Except for one deputy secretary, all other responsible comrades of the county committee went deep into the townships and mobilized more than 120 people from county-level organs to go to various townships and communes to mobilize and personally participate in drought resistance and rice transplanting.

　　In order to make Majiang County's work keep up with the pace of the Great Leap Forward in the entire prefecture, the prefectural committee decided to launch a prefecture-wide collaboration. It mobilized 400 activists from the six counties of Huangping, Shibing, Tianzhu, Zhenyuan, Sansui, and Cengong, which had already finished transplanting rice seedlings, as well as the prefecture-level organs. Led by Prefectural Governor Wang Dean himself, they did not want work points, and brought their own food and drought-resistant tools—pumps, pressure pumps, water diversion machines, etc.—to help Majiang in its drought-resistant and shock rice transplanting efforts. Encouraged by this socialist friendship, the cadres and masses of Majiang County acted more quickly. After a month of hard work day and night, all the county's irrigated and dry land was sown.

　　The work in Majiang County has been basically improved, and all tasks have gradually kept up with the pace of the Great Leap Forward. The masses sang loudly to the leading cadres who worked with them:

　　The leadership is accurate,
　　The masses work hard without slacking,
　　Aim for yields of a thousand catties per mu,
　　Everyone has confidence.

　　两首民歌的由来
    本报记者　肖明
    今年6月以前，贵州麻江县出现了这样一首民歌：
    上级无主张，
    天旱插不上秧，
    今年无收成，
    难道要我们去逃荒。
    当时，麻江县旱象严重，县委负责同志没有采取积极的抗旱措施，却只是消极地望天下雨，因此群众编了那首民歌。
    黔东南苗族侗族自治州州委书记来检查工作时，发现这种情况，就带着县委负责同志前往，也在遭受干旱威胁的丹寨参观。清水江上游的龙洞河，是丹寨与麻江的分界线，河南是丹寨，河北是麻江，因为丹寨注意了抗旱工作，田禾生长得很好。
    经过亲眼参观了丹寨以后，县委同志开始清醒了。他们发现就在城郊，四五丈深下边即是哗哗流水，上边的田却干得开裂；修个一里长的水渠，或几十公尺长的水枧，就能解决大片地的用水问题，但却无人组织，无人动手。本县的新场乡等许多乡社，在同样干旱情况下，插秧70％。县委只把这些先进乡社材料用作汇报材料，而不去亲自总结经验，推动全面工作。
    检查了这些思想以后，县委作了紧急行动计划，县委负责同志除留下一位副书记外，其他一律深入乡社，并且动员了县级机关一百二十多人，到各乡、社发动并亲自参加抗旱插秧。
    为使麻江县的工作跟上全州大跃进的步伐，州委决定发动一次全州大协作。动员已经结束插秧的黄平、施秉、天柱、镇远、三穗、岑巩六个县及州级各机关，共组织了四百多名积极分子，由州长王德安亲自率领，不要工分，并且自带粮食，自带抗旱工具——抽水机、压水机、引水机等，帮助麻江抗旱突击插秧。麻江县的干部和群众在这社会主义友谊的鼓舞下，更迅速地行动起来，经一个月的苦干夜战，全县的水旱地全部播种完毕。
    麻江县的工作已基本改观，各项工作都已逐步跟上了跃进的步伐。群众冲着与他们一同劳动的领导干部，高声唱着：
    领导方面抓得准，
    群众努力不松劲，
    亩产千斤争上游，
    大家全都有信心。
