Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: The following is a summary of the resolution on student activities to safeguard peace, passed by the Fifth Congress of the International Student Union (ISU).

The Fifth Congress of the ISU believes that the issue of war and peace is of vital importance to students all over the world. When humanity faces the danger of atomic war, intricately linked to all aspects of human life, students cannot remain indifferent.

The United States and Britain continue to conduct nuclear weapons tests; establish military bases equipped with nuclear weapons and missiles in foreign countries; the US-British imperialist aggression against Lebanon and Jordan; and the US aggression and provocation in the Taiwan Strait have further deteriorated the situation. Facts have clearly shown that imperialism is the permanent cause of war.

The Congress noted that in the past two years, the forces resolutely opposing imperialist war preparations and striving for peace have grown unprecedentedly around the world. The Congress firmly believes that if all peace-loving forces unite closely and persist in their struggle, war can certainly be stopped. In the past two years, a new high tide has emerged in the national liberation movement, which is making important contributions to the cause of peace, and the struggle for peace is closely linked to the anti-colonialist struggle.

The Congress noted with satisfaction that the number of students from various countries participating in the struggle for peace and against imperialism is rapidly increasing, and the Congress considers it to be the most significant characteristic of today's student movement. These activities of various student organizations are an integral part of the world peace movement.

Students need peace and the easing of international tensions, and they fight for it because they understand that war preparations bring a heavy burden of military expenditure to the people, a declining standard of living, and fewer and fewer opportunities for education. They want to rapidly develop science and technology to serve peaceful construction and the interests of the people.

The Congress values the ISU's consistent encouragement and support for the contributions made by student organizations in their efforts to achieve peace. The Congress decided that the ISU should further intensify its efforts to strive for world peace:

	-- Demand that the United States and Britain immediately and unconditionally cease all nuclear weapons tests, as the Soviet Union did in March 1958.
	-- Oppose the transfer of nuclear weapons and missiles to other countries and the establishment of military bases equipped with these weapons there, and demand the establishment of nuclear-free zones in Central Europe and Asia, including the Middle East.
	-- Condemn the imperialist aggression of the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan, and demand their immediate withdrawal.
	-- Condemn the US imperialist aggression and provocation against China in the Taiwan Strait area, as this is a brazen interference in China's internal affairs, and demand the immediate withdrawal of US troops from this area.
	-- Demand the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.
	-- Demand an end to the colonial wars aimed at suppressing Cameroon, Kenya, and Cyprus, especially the war in Algeria, which has lasted for four years and threatens the entire North Africa, and demand respect for the right to national self-determination and national independence, as important conditions for achieving peace.
	-- Support the demand and desire of the Korean people and students for the peaceful reunification of their country without any foreign interference, and therefore demand the immediate withdrawal of US and other foreign troops from South Korea.
	-- Support the legitimate struggle of the Vietnamese people and students for the full implementation of the 1954 Geneva Accords and the reunification of Vietnam, and demand an end to US military intervention in South Vietnam.
	-- Support the peaceful reunification of the two Germanys through negotiations, oppose the restoration of fascism, and oppose the equipping of West German troops with nuclear weapons.
	-- Support the struggle of Japanese students and people against nuclear armament and against the revival of militarism on Okinawa and the Japanese mainland.
	-- Support the struggle of Cambodian students and people to consolidate their country's neutral policy of peaceful coexistence, condemn US imperialism for instigating South Vietnam and Thailand to repeatedly violate Cambodia's borders and occupy Cambodian territory, and demand an end to this pressure.
	-- Support the struggle of North African students and people together for the withdrawal of foreign troops and the removal of foreign bases that threaten their territorial integrity and independence.
	-- Oppose the planning of new regional military treaties in the Far East and Latin America, and demand the abolition of all existing military treaties and bases abroad.
	-- Demand a reduction in military expenditure, the achievement of a general agreement on disarmament, so that more funds can be used for education, culture and public welfare.
	-- Oppose the Cold War policy and demand constructive cooperation among countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
	-- The Congress fully supports the Seventh World Youth Festival to be held in Vienna in 1959.

The Congress believes that student organizations must take broad and concerted action to achieve these goals.

Believing that students, with their youth and wisdom, can make a significant contribution to peace, the Congress calls on students around the world to make their utmost efforts to safeguard peace.

    帝国主义是战争的永久的起因
    全世界学生必须全力维护和平
    国际学联代表大会关于学生维护和平活动的决议摘要
    新华社15日讯　国际学联第五届代表大会通过的关于学生维护和平活动的决议（摘要）。
    国际学联第五届代表大会认为战争与和平问题对世界各地学生来说是有切身的重要性的，当人类面临原子战争的危险、原子战争错综复杂地关联到人类生活的各个方面的时候，学生对此不能无动于衷。
    美国和英国继续进行核武器试验；在外国建立用核武器和导弹装备的军事基地；对黎巴嫩和约旦的美英帝国主义侵略；以及美国在台湾海峡地区的侵略和挑衅使局势更加恶化，事实已经清楚地表明帝国主义是战争的永久的起因。
    大会注意到在过去两年里，坚决反对帝国主义的战争准备和争取和平的力量已经在全世界空前壮大起来，大会坚信，如果所有爱好和平的力量紧密地团结在一起坚持斗争，战争就一定可以被制止。在过去两年中民族解放运动出现了一个新的高潮，民族解放运动对和平事业正在作出重要的贡献，而争取和平的斗争是和反殖民主义斗争紧密地联系着的。
    大会满意地注意到参加争取和平和反对帝国主义斗争的各国学生的人数正在迅速地增加，大会并认为它是今天学生运动最显著的特点，各学生组织的这种活动是世界和平运动的一个组成部分。
    学生们需要和平和国际紧张局势的缓和，并为此而斗争，因为他们懂得备战给人民带来沉重的军事开支的负担、日益下降的生活水平和愈来愈少的受教育的机会。他们要迅速地发展科学技术来为和平建设、为人民的利益而服务。
    大会重视国际学联经常鼓励和支持各学生组织为争取和平所作的贡献。大会决定国际学联应该进一步加紧努力来争取世界和平：
    ——要求美国和英国像1958年3月苏联所作的那样立即无条件地停止一切核武器试验。
    ——反对向别国输送核武器和导弹，在那里建立以这些武器装备起来的军事基地，并且要求在欧洲中部和亚洲包括中东在内建立无核子地带。
    ——谴责美、英在黎巴嫩、约旦的帝国主义侵略，并要求他们立即撤军。
    ——谴责美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区内对中国的侵略和挑衅，因为这是对中国人民内政的厚颜无耻的干涉，要求美军立即撤出这个地区。
    ——要求恢复中国在联合国的合法地位。
    ——要求停止旨在镇压喀麦隆、怯尼亚和塞浦路斯的殖民战争，特别是在阿尔及利亚进行的战争，它已经延续了四年，威胁到整个北非，并且要求尊重民族自决权和民族独立，把它们作为争取和平的重要条件。
    ——支持朝鲜人民和学生在没有任何外国干涉的情况下和平统一他们祖国的要求和愿望，因此，要求美国和其他外国军队立即撤出南朝鲜。
    ——支持越南人民和学生为完全实现1954年日内瓦协议和统一越南的合法斗争，并要求停止在南越的美国军事干涉。
    ——支持两个德国通过谈判和平地取得统一，反对法西斯主义的复辟和用核武器来装备西德的军队。
    ——支持日本学生和人民为反对核子军备和反对在冲绳岛和日本本土复活军国主义而进行的斗争。
    ——支持柬埔寨学生和人民的斗争，支持他们为巩固他们国家的和平共处的中立政策，谴责美国帝国主义唆使南越和泰国一次又一次地触犯柬埔寨的边境，占领柬埔寨的领土的斗争，并且要求制止这种压力。
    ——支持北非学生和人民一起为撤退外国的军队和撤除威胁他们的领土完整和独立的外国基地的斗争。
    ——反对在远东和拉丁美洲策划新的区域性军事条约，并要求取消一切现有的军事条约和在国外的基地。
    ——要求削减军事开支，达成关于裁军的一般性协议，使更多的拨款能够用于教育、文化和公共福利事业。
    ——反对冷战政策，要求各国在和平共处五项原则的基础上进行建设性的合作。
    ——大会全力支持1959年在维也纳举行的第七届联欢节。
    大会认为各学生组织必须采取广泛的一致行动来达到这些目的。
    由于相信学生以他们的青春与智慧能对和平作出相当的贡献，大会号召全世界学生尽最大的努力来维护和平。
