Xinhua News Agency, 18th, Bangkok dispatch: The aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) military advisors' conference, attended by US Pacific Area Forces Commander Felt, ended today in Bangkok.

The United States attempted to discuss the situation in the Taiwan area at this conference, in order to drag SEATO member states into its military adventurism in the Taiwan area through this military advisors' conference.

As early as September 11th, Eisenhower, in his infamous television speech, threatened countries in the Western Pacific region, particularly the Philippines, with possible "aggression," attempting to drive these countries to support the US war adventure in the Taiwan Strait. At the same time, Felt spent four days in the Philippines on his way to Bangkok for the meeting. He also made war cries in Manila on the 11th. Felt issued frantic aggressor howls at this conference, saying that the US fleet "is not fixed on any point on the earth's surface."

However, these plans of the United States were opposed by its allies. According to the Associated Press, New Zealand, Britain, and Thailand "temporarily opposed discussing any controversial issues not directly related to SEATO." Although the Philippine representative, Philippine Armed Forces Chief of Staff Arellano, requested the conference to discuss the "implications arising" from the Taiwan area situation, and said that "the issue he hoped to discuss" was what action SEATO would take if the Taiwan situation "spread or became uncontrollable," Arellano went on to say that he "had not yet considered extending the scope of SEATO protection to the Formosa (Taiwan) Strait." Thai Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Nai Waiwit had told reporters as early as the 13th that Thailand did not approve of including Taiwan in SEATO's "defense scope." He said that other member states of SEATO had to consider the consequences of including Taiwan in the "defense scope" of this military group.

From the communique issued today by this SEATO military advisors' conference, it can also be seen that the original US plan did not succeed. The communique only stated that the conference discussed the issue of "current threats to the SEATO area," without specifying that the situation in the Taiwan area was discussed. The United States cannot command the military aggression group it planned as it wishes.

However, the conference communique shows that this military group will continue to create tension in the region. The communique said that the conference decided to continue holding a series of military exercises "to further increase the joint military capabilities of SEATO."

### 东南亚集团军事会议草草收场  美国想拉帮凶未遂

    东南亚集团军事会议草草收场
    美国想拉帮凶未遂
    新华社18日讯　曼谷消息：在美国太平洋地区部队总司令费耳特参加下举行的侵略性的东南亚条约组织军事顾问会议今天在曼谷结束。
    美国曾力图在这次会议上讨论台湾地区局势问题，以便通过这次军事顾问会议把东南亚条约组织成员国拖进它在台湾地区进行的军事冒险活动里。
    早在9月11日，艾森豪威尔在他的臭名远扬的电视演说中曾恫吓说西太平洋地区国家，特别是菲律宾可能受到“侵略”，企图驱使这些国家支持美国在台湾海峡地区的战争冒险。同时费耳特在前往曼谷开会的时候到菲律宾进行了四天的活动。他在11日在马尼拉也作了战争的叫嚣。费耳特在这个会议上又发出猖狂的侵略者的嗥叫，他说美国的舰队“不是固定在地球表面的任何一点上”。
    但是美国的这些打算遭到了他的盟国的反对。据美联社报道，新西兰、英国和泰国都“暂时反对讨论任何与东南亚条约组织没有直接关系的争论性的问题”。菲律宾代表、菲律宾武装部队参谋长阿雷亚诺虽曾要求会议讨论台湾地区局势“产生的牵连”问题，并说他“所希望讨论的问题”是，如果台湾局势问题“蔓延或者变得无法控制的话，东南亚条约组织将采取什么行动”。但阿雷亚诺接着又说，他“还没有考虑把东南亚条约的保护范围扩大到福摩萨（台湾）海峡”。泰国外交部副部长乃威戍早在13日就曾经向报界说，泰国不赞成把台湾列入东南亚条约组织的“防卫范围”。他说，东南亚条约组织的其它成员国是要考虑把台湾列入这个军事集团的“防卫范围”的后果的。
    从这次东南亚条约组织军事顾问会议今天发表的公报中也可看出美国原来的打算并未得逞。公报中只说会议讨论了“目前的对东南亚条约地区的威胁”的问题，而没有写明讨论了台湾地区局势问题。美国对它一手策划组成的军事侵略集团也不能指挥如意了。
    但是，会议公报表明，这个军事集团还要继续在这个地区制造紧张局势。公报说，会议确定要继续举行一系列的军事演习，“以进一步增加东南亚条约组织的联合军事能力”。
