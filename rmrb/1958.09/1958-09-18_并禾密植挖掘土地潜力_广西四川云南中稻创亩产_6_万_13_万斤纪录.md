Through close planting and dense planting to unleash land potential, Guangxi, Sichuan and Yunnan achieve record middle-season rice yields of 60,000 to 130,000 jin per mu.

    (Our report) The Hongqi People's Commune in Huanjiang County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, successfully used highly close planting and dense planting methods to achieve a new high-yield record of an average middle-season rice yield of 130,434 jin, ten liang, and four qian per mu. This high-yield field area was one mu, seven li, and five hao. It was black soil, second-class land, and yielded a total of 140,217 jin and four liang of dried grain.

    The harvest of this high-yield middle-season rice field began at 10:00 AM on September 9th, with over 400 people participating in the harvest. On a wide highway, thirty threshing machines roared all day long. Forty-two carts with newly installed ball bearings and fifty-nine shoulder-pole carrying commune members transported the harvest to the drying ground in an endless stream. After more than eleven hours of hard work, the entire harvest was completed at 9:30 PM that day.

    This field used the "close planting" method, with seedlings transplanted from another 18.9 mu of heading fields. It is estimated that there were a total of more than 1.31 million clumps, with about eight ears per clump. The density was so high that it was almost impossible to insert a hand, and it was impossible to distinguish between row spacing and plant spacing.

    (Our report) The No. 9 Agricultural Cooperative of Youai Township, Pixian County, Sichuan Province, adopted the method of merging seedlings and created a high-yield achievement of 82,525 jin per mu of middle-season rice.

    This was achieved in a middle-season rice field of one mu and eight li, with a yield of 89,127 jin of dried grain. The harvest was completed from September 5th to 6th.

    This close planting experiment answered the question of how densely rice paddies can be planted and how much grain can be produced per mu. From August 15th to 16th, Youai No. 9 Cooperative transplanted seedlings that were already scattering seeds from 35.7 mu of land into this field, planting a total of more than 764,000 clumps, with more than 9,944,000 ears, each ear with about 180 grains. This field had already yielded 1,342 jin of early rice this year; before the early rice, it had yielded 124 jin of rapeseed.

    The experiment by Youai No. 9 Cooperative also proved that freeing up land can increase the planting of one season of crops, making full use of the land's fertility. The sweet potatoes they have additionally planted in the rice fields after transplanting the seedlings are growing very well and are expected to yield at least 2,000 jin. The buckwheat planted in the middle of the sweet potatoes can also yield more than 100 jin.

    The Pixian County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to vigorously promote the method of merging seedlings and transplanting in rice production next year. Merging seedlings in early rice to free up land for planting early and middle rice, and merging seedlings in middle rice to free up land for planting late rice. In this way, together with the spring crops and late autumn crops, four to five harvests can be achieved throughout the year. The County Party Committee has also decided to conduct similar experiments on crops such as wheat, rapeseed, tobacco, hemp, and corn.

    (Our report) The Satellite People's Commune in the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province created a high-yield record of 61,584 jin and two liang of middle-season rice per mu and one fen of rice field.

    The harvest of this experimental field began on the 6th. 0.85 mu was harvested (the remaining 0.25 mu was left for visitors), yielding 52,346 jin and eight liang of dried grain, equivalent to a yield of 61,584 jin and two liang per mu.

    This high-yield record, which was previously unimaginable, is the result of criticizing the "theory of backwardness," humbly learning from the advanced experiences of the Han people, and boldly innovating. Originally, this high-yield field was planted with only 4,800 clumps, plowed to a depth of seven inches, and did not have enough fertilizer. Later, the County Party Committee criticized the theory of backwardness during the rectification campaign, and the rice seedlings in this field were uprooted, re-plowed, and harrowed to a depth of 1.5 feet, using more than 100,000 jin of fertilizer and eight jin of "666" powder, including the base fertilizer. Rice seedlings were transplanted from 35.5 mu of land into this field.

    并禾密植挖掘土地潜力
    广西四川云南中稻创亩产6万—13万斤纪录
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区环江县红旗人民公社，成功地运用了高度并禾密植方法，获得中稻平均亩产十三万零四百三十四斤十两四钱的高产新纪录。这块高产田面积一亩零七厘五，黑壤土，二等田，共收干谷一十四万零二百一十七斤四两。
    这块高产中稻田，从9月9日上午十点钟开镰，共有四百多人参加收割。在一条宽广的公路上，三十部打谷机终日隆隆作响。新装上滚珠轴承的四十二辆车子，五十九个肩挑社员络绎不绝地运往晒谷坪，经过了十一个多小时的苦战，直到当天下午九时三十分才全部收割完毕。
    这块田是采用“并禾”的办法，从另外十八点九亩抽穗的田里移来的。据估计总共约有一百三十一万多蔸，每蔸八穗左右，密的程度几乎用手插不进去，分不出行距和株距。
    本报讯　四川省郫县友爱乡第九农业社采用并秧的办法，创造了中稻亩产八万二千五百二十五斤的高产成绩。
    这是在一亩零八厘中稻田内取得的，共产干谷八万九千一百二十七斤。9月5日到6日收割完毕。
    这次并秧试验回答了一亩稻田究竟可以密植到什么程度，打多少粮食？友爱九社于8月15日到16日把三十五亩七分正在散籽的秧子并入这块田中，共栽七十六万四千多窝，九百九十四万四千多穗，每穗一百八十粒左右。这块田里今年已收过早稻一千三百四十二斤；早稻之前，收过油菜子一百二十四斤。
    友爱九社的试验还证明空出田来可以增种一季作物，充分利用地力。现在他们在移苗后的稻田里增种的红苕生长很好，预计最少可收两千斤，红苕中间种的荞麦也可收一百多斤。
    中共郫县县委已决定明年水稻方面大力推广并秧移栽法，早稻并秧腾出田来栽早中稻，中稻并秧腾出田来栽晚稻。这样加上春天的小春作物和晚秋作物，全年就可以做到四熟到五熟。在小麦、油菜、烟、麻、玉米等作物方面，县委也决定进行同样试验。
    本报讯　云南红河哈尼族彝族自治州的卫星人民公社一亩一分中稻田里创造了六万一千五百八十四斤二两中稻的高产纪录。
    这块试验田是6日开始收割的，收了零点八五亩（余零点二五亩留着供参观），计得干谷五万二千三百四十六斤八两，折合亩产六万一千五百八十四斤二两。
    这个在过去为人所不敢设想的高产纪录，是批判“落后论”、虚心学习汉族的先进经验，大胆革新的结果。原来这块高产田只栽了四千八百窝，犁了七寸深，肥料也不足。后来县委在整风中批判了落后论，又把这块田的禾苗拔了，重新犁耙、耕层深达一尺五寸，连底肥共施用了十多万斤肥料和八斤“六六六”粉。把三十五亩半水稻拔来并在这块田里。
