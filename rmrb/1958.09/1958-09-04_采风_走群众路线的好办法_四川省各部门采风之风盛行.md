Xinhua News Agency - Gathering Folk Songs – A Good Way to Follow the Mass Line
	The Trend of Gathering Folk Songs is Prevailing in Various Departments in Sichuan Province
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) A mass movement of large-scale folk song gathering, spanning various departments, is underway in Sichuan Province. This folk song gathering activity has expanded from the initial arts and sciences departments to education, health, cultural departments, and industrial and agricultural departments in some areas. The Propaganda Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the folk song gathering activity is a new form of realizing the combination of popularization and improvement, the combination of experts and the masses, and the combination of scientific research and production practice. It is a good way to follow the mass line in various tasks and can be promoted in all departments and all aspects.
    The folk song gathering activities of various departments in Sichuan Province generally focus on solving the urgent problems in current practical work and production practice. For example, the Education Department focuses on collecting various textbooks for general middle schools, agricultural middle schools, etc., compiled from the special districts, counties, townships to the agricultural cooperatives, and at the same time collecting the experiences and inventions obtained by various schools in implementing the policy of combining education with labor. Collecting various inventions and creations of the masses in the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, as well as proven prescriptions and secret recipes in folk medicine, is the main task of the folk song gathering of the province's health departments. The leading institution of literary and artistic work in Sichuan Province has recently decided to expand the folk song gathering activity from collecting folk songs to collecting and collating folk tales, folk stories, and folk literature of minority ethnic groups, mainly the Yi people. Yunyang County has also widely launched a "technical folk song gathering" movement centered on summarizing the technology of indigenous blast furnace smelting.
    Many regions and departments have established special agencies such as folk song gathering offices and technical innovation offices, mobilizing professional staff from all aspects to go deep into the masses, discuss and explore with the masses, and collect, sort out, study, and appraise and promote simultaneously. The Education Department of Sichuan Province, on the one hand, transferred a group of teachers from various schools and entrusted the teachers and students of Southwest Normal College and Sichuan Normal College to visit dozens of private middle schools, factories, and rural areas respectively to collect information and experience on agricultural middle schools, and compiled new textbooks in a timely manner.

　　采风——走群众路线的好办法
    四川省各部门采风之风盛行
    据新华社讯　四川省正在开展一个遍及各部门的群众性的大采风运动。这个采风活动已从最先开始的文艺、科学部门扩展到教育、卫生、文化部门和某些地区的工业、农业部门。中共四川省委宣传部认为，采风活动是实现普及与提高相结合、专家与群众相结合、科学研究与生产实践相结合的新形式，是各项工作走群众路线的一个好办法，可以在一切部门、一切方面推广。
    四川省各部门的采风活动，一般都以解决当前实际工作和生产实践中的迫切问题为中心。比如教育厅着重搜集从专区、县、乡到农业社编写的普通中学、农业中学等各种教材，同时搜集各种学校在贯彻教育与劳动相结合的方针中取得的经验和创造发明。搜集群众在除四害、讲卫生运动中各种创造发明、民间医药中验方、秘方是全省卫生部门采风的主要任务。四川省文艺工作领导机构最近也决定把采风活动从搜集民歌扩大到民间传说、民间故事和以彝族为主的少数民族民间文学的采集和整理。云阳县还广泛开展了以总结土高炉冶炼技术为中心的“技术采风”运动。
    不少地区和部门成立了采风办公室、技术革新办公室等专门机构，发动各方面专业工作人员深入群众，与群众一起商量、发掘，并一面采集，一面整理、研究，一面鉴定、推广。四川省教育厅一方面从各地学校调集了一批教师，并委托西南师范学院和四川师范学院师生，分别访问了几十所民办中学和工厂、农村，采集农业中学的情况和经验，及时编写出新教材。
