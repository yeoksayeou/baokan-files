Based on the content reported and discussed at the agricultural secretary meetings held in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, the following are some of the main experiences in leading the great leap forward in agricultural production over the past year:

First, ideology is the soul, and politics is the commander. Constantly uprooting white flags and planting red flags, carrying out the struggle between two roads and the struggle between two lines, is the primary guarantee for the great leap forward in agricultural production. Experience has proven that agricultural production conditions can be changed, and any place can increase production; the key lies in who is in charge. Without the anti-Rightist struggle, without the socialist great debate centered on the grain issue, and without a relatively thorough resolution of the struggle between the two roads politically and ideologically, a great leap forward in agricultural production is impossible. Without the Party's general line for socialist construction, without breaking superstitions, liberating thought, and thoroughly criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, a great leap forward in agricultural production is also impossible. Without the nationwide Party-wide rectification movement, without sweeping away the "three winds and five airs," and without creating a new political situation in the relationship between people—that is, a political situation that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, both with unified will and individual ease of mind, liveliness, and vigor—a great leap forward in agricultural production is also impossible. Of course, ideological liberation develops with the development of objective reality and with the development of people's understanding of objective nature.

In the nationwide comprehensive great leap forward, there are a few counties, townships, and communes that do not have a leap forward situation; they have very little or no increase in production, or even a decrease. Tracing the reasons, it is either capitalist elements stirring up trouble there, or people with serious right-leaning conservative ideas issuing orders there. Conversely, in the vast majority of places, a deep and thorough struggle against capitalist ideology and right-leaning conservative thinking was carried out, bourgeois rightists were thoroughly exposed and seriously dealt with, and people with serious right-leaning conservative thinking were removed from leadership positions. In those places, the unhealthy trends and evil practices could not raise their heads, the masses' awareness was rapidly raised, righteousness was high, and morale was full, with production surges wave after wave. However, from a national perspective, no matter what place, even in places where ideological struggle has been carried out relatively well, capitalist tendencies will still appear in one form or another, and the struggle between the two roads in the ideological field is still long-term; right-leaning conservative thinking will still be a stumbling block on our road forward, and the struggle between the advanced and the backward will be permanent. Therefore, constantly uprooting white flags and planting red flags remains the most important guarantee for the continued leap forward in agricultural production.

Second, establish a communist leadership style. The masses call this style "pointing far, clear direction, bold courage, and full of vigor." Wherever this style is established, the mass movement is vigorous, morale is soaring, like a bamboo splitting, with a momentum that swallows mountains and rivers, and parochialism and individualism have been submerged by the communist style of "one for all, all for one." "Ten days to build a reservoir," "one day to set up a factory," "two months to eliminate illiteracy," bringing their own tools and rations, selflessly supporting other communes, townships, and counties, and using their advanced experience, advanced technology, and manpower and materials to support their competitors in a timely manner, to achieve a common leap forward, and so on. Conversely, where cadres are complacent, lethargic, timid, and vacillating, the work is "desolate, lonely, and miserable." The masses praise the former type of leadership as "big-hearted and bold, afraid of nothing"; they despise the latter type of leadership as "small-hearted and timid, unable to do anything."

Third, lead the agricultural production movement with the spirit of "continuous revolution." Leading peasants in production, like leading other mass movements, requires the constant introduction of new tasks immediately after the completion of one task. Only in this way can we continuously maintain a strong morale, keep everyone full of hope, invigorated, tense, and happy, and move forward with full confidence. At the same time, agricultural production has different requirements in different seasons. Each crop, from land preparation to sowing to harvesting, goes through several key stages in its entire growth period. The requirements of various crops and various stages are different, and the timing is also different. Therefore, it is not possible to achieve a full and comprehensive harvest for the whole year by launching a single high tide or organizing a single assault. It is necessary to arrange agricultural activities one after another according to the different seasons and the different growth conditions of various crops. Generally speaking, a new task should be proposed and an assault organized every week, every ten days, or at most every half a month. In this way, it is possible both to seize the farming season and complete various agricultural activities in a concentrated manner, and to promote the high tide of the production movement wave after wave in a rhythmic manner.

Fourth, follow the mass line. Adopt forms such as big airing, big blooming, big debate, big-character posters, on-the-spot meetings, and exhibitions to fully promote socialist democracy, gather the opinions of the masses, and transform these collected opinions into the collective will of the masses, into things that the masses want to do themselves, and rely on the masses to use their brains, find tricks, and do these things together. "Bring, Learn, Look, Debate, Compare" - the five-character formula. Cadres take the lead, learn if they don't know, look if they don't believe, debate if they don't understand, and compete and compare. Wherever this leadership method is conscientiously implemented, the masses and cadres have the same thinking and unified language. The masses praise the cadres as "good leaders sent by Chairman Mao," and the cadres say that the masses "strike wherever they point, and they are really easy to lead." The morale of the masses is raised higher and higher, the methods are learned more and more, the confidence is seen more and more, the direction is debated more and more clearly, and the drive is compared more and more fully. Agricultural production is advancing rapidly and vividly.

Fifth, develop and strengthen the ranks of socialist activists who are both red and expert. On the basis of the great leap forward in agricultural production and the unprecedentedly high socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants, a contingent of socialist construction activists striving toward the goal of being both red and expert has begun to form in the countryside. In some places, the number of people in this contingent accounts for about 20 to 30 percent of the rural male and female labor force. They are all standing at the forefront of the struggle on various fronts of socialist construction. They are the main reliance of the Party in the countryside to implement the general line and build socialism. They are the backbone of the masses and the bridge for the Party to connect with the masses. Without such a group of activists, the new high tide and great leap forward in agricultural production over the past year would have been unimaginable. We should attach great importance to cultivating and developing this contingent of activists, improving them politically, culturally, and technically, and constantly placing them under the supervision of the masses to prevent them from becoming arrogant, complacent, and detached from the masses, so that they can become the backbone of leading the broad masses of peasants, carrying out technical revolution and cultural revolution, and building a modern socialist new countryside under the leadership of the Party.

Sixth, cultivate experimental plots. Cadres, farmers, and technicians cooperate in cultivating experimental plots. This is the best leadership method and an extremely valuable creation. Promoting this leadership method of cultivating experimental plots is an important key to changing the leadership style. Before cultivating experimental plots, the masses said that the cadres were "masters"; after cultivating experimental plots, the masses said that the cadres were "good leaders," fundamentally changing the relationship between cadres and the masses. By cultivating experimental plots, cadres truly participate in production, lead production, and lead mass production with their own production practices and experimental results, which greatly overcomes subjectivism and coercion. Cultivating experimental plots transforms cadres from laymen into experts, and it is the gateway for cadres to become both red and expert. This leadership method of cultivating experimental plots, combined with the method of widely absorbing commune members to participate in commune affairs management and field operation management, complements each other. This is a new creation of following the mass line and practicing democratic commune management, and it should be seriously promoted.

Seventh, conduct major inspections several times a year. Inspection and comparison are a very successful method of leading the agricultural production movement and promoting the continuous advancement of the high tide. Chairman Mao instructed in the "Sixty Articles on Working Methods" that the central government should conduct four inspections a year, which refers to comprehensive major inspections. In fact, there have been many inspections, large and small, since the new production upsurge last winter. The number of inspections by provinces, special districts, and counties, as well as the inspections by townships and communes themselves, is even greater. Each inspection and comparison is a promotion and encouragement to the work. Many places are now conducting five-level major inspections in provinces, special districts, counties, townships, and communes, which is also a great impetus to the current autumn field management, autumn harvest preparation, and various preparatory work for autumn farmland capital construction. Every agricultural cooperative should not only have advanced planned targets, but also specific production increase measures, and the plan should be implemented in teams, the measures should be implemented in the fields, and the responsibility should be implemented in people. Inspect and compare at any time, grasp both ends, and bring the middle along, commend the advanced, and eliminate backward fields and backward teams. This is an important experience and plays a decisive role in overcoming the problems of being flashy but not practical, superficial but not deep, and rough but not detailed in a timely manner. The more advanced the indicators, the more specific the measures, the more clear the responsibilities, and the more frequent the inspections and comparisons, the higher the confidence of the masses and the more motivated they are.

Eighth, the secretary takes command, all parties cooperate, comprehensively plan, and strengthen leadership. Agricultural production is not isolated; it requires the support of industry, and its relationship with commerce is particularly close. It must be led by the main responsible comrades of the Party committees at all levels who "command the three armies" in person. For agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and various production, cultural, and welfare undertakings in rural areas, comprehensive planning and unified arrangements must be made. Everyone should be multi-skilled and multi-talented, engaging in both agriculture, industry, and military affairs, so as to organize the rural labor force more rationally and give full play to labor potential.

At the same time, it is also necessary to take the Party committee as the core and organize comprehensive communist large-scale cooperation between regions, between townships and communes, between urban and rural industry and agriculture, and between competent departments and relevant departments, so that all aspects are "twisted into one rope," taking the great leap forward in production as the key link to drive the overall great leap forward in various socialist construction undertakings in rural areas.

    领导农业大跃进的经验
    中华人民共和国农业部
    综合各省、市、自治区在分区召开的农业书记会议上汇报讨论的内容，关于一年来领导农业生产大跃进，有如下的几点主要经验：
    第一，思想是灵魂，政治是统帅。不断地拔白旗、插红旗，开展两条道路的斗争和两条路线的斗争，是农业生产大跃进的首要保证。经验证明，农业生产条件是可以改变的，任何地方都可以增产，关键在于谁当家。没有反右派斗争，没有以粮食问题为中心的社会主义大辩论，不在政治上思想上比较彻底地解决两条道路斗争的问题，农业生产大跃进是不可能的。没有党的社会主义建设总路线，不破除迷信，解放思想，不彻底批判掉右倾保守思想，农业生产大跃进也是不可能的。没有全党全民整风运动，不扫除三风五气，不在人与人的关系上造成一种崭新的政治局面，即：既有集中又有民主，既有纪律又有自由，既有统一意志又有个人的心情舒畅生动活泼的政治局面，农业生产大跃进也是不可能的。当然思想解放是随着客观实际的发展而发展的，是随着人们对客观自然认识的发展而发展的。
    在全国规模的全面大跃进中，有少数县、乡、社，并不存在跃进形势，他们那里增产很少，或者没有增产，甚至减了产。追究其原因，不是资本主义分子在那里兴风作浪，便是右倾保守思想严重的人在那里发号施令。反之，在绝大多数地方，对资本主义思想和右倾保守思想进行了深透的斗争，彻底揭发和严肃处理了资产阶级右派分子，把右倾保守思想严重的人从领导岗位撤下来，那里的歪风邪气就抬不起头来，群众的觉悟迅速提高，正气昂扬，干劲十足，生产高潮一浪赶一浪。但是，从全国范围看来，无论什么地方，即使是思想斗争开展得比较好的地方，资本主义倾向，还会以这种形式或那种形式出现，在思想领域中两条道路的斗争还是长期的；右倾保守思想也还会是我们前进道路上的绊脚石，先进与落后的斗争将是永久存在的。因此，不断地拔白旗、插红旗，仍然是农业生产继续跃进的最重要的保证。
    第二、树立共产主义的领导风格。群众把这种风格叫做是：“指的远、方向明、胆子大、干劲足”。凡是树立了这种风格的地方，群众运动就轰轰烈烈，干劲冲天，势如破竹，气吞山河，本位主义和个人主义已被“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义风格所淹没。“十天修一座水库”，“一天办一个工厂”，“两月扫除文盲”，自带工具、口粮，无偿地支援外社、外乡、外县以及以自己的先进经验、先进技术和人力物力及时地支援竞赛的对方，以达到共同跃进，如此等等。反之，那里的干部老大自满，暮气沉沉，畏畏缩缩，左右摇摆，那里的工作就“冷冷清清，凄凄惨惨切切”。群众称赞前一种领导是：“心大意大，什么也不怕”；鄙视后一种领导是：“心小意小，什么也干不了”。
    第三、以“不断革命”的精神，去领导农业生产运动。领导农民搞生产，也像领导其他群众运动一样，在一个任务完成以后，必须紧接着提出新的任务，这才能不断地保持旺盛的士气，使大家充满希望，精神焕发，紧张愉快，信心百倍地前进。同时，农业生产在不同的季节有不同的要求。每一种农作物从整地到播种到收获，在整个生长期中都要经过几个关节，各种作物、各种关节的要求各不相同，时间也先后不一。因此，不是发动一个高潮，组织一次突击，就可以获得全年全面丰收的。必须根据不同的季节和各种农作物的不同的生长情况，一项接着一项地安排农事活动，一般说来，每个星期，每十天，顶多半个月提出一项新的任务，组织一次突击。这样，既能够抓紧农时，突击完成各项农事活动，又能够使生产运动的高潮一浪接着一浪地有节奏地向前推进。
    第四、走群众路线。采取大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报、现场会、展览会等等形式，充分发扬社会主义民主，把群众的意见集中起来，又把这种集中的意见变成群众的集体意志，变成群众自己所要办的事，并且依靠群众动脑筋，找窍门，大家动手去办成这些事。“带、学、看、辩、比”——五字诀。干部带头，不会就学，不信就看，不通就辩，竞赛评比。凡是认真实行了这种领导方法的地方，群众和干部思想一致，语言统一，群众称干部是“毛主席派来的好打头的”，干部说群众是“指那里打那里，真好领导”，群众情绪越带越高，办法越学越多，信心越看越大，方向越辩越明，干劲越比越足，农业生产一日千里，有声有色。
    第五、发展壮大又红又专的社会主义积极分子的队伍。在农业生产大跃进和广大农民的社会主义积极性空前高涨的基础上，农村中已经开始形成一支向着又红又专的目标前进的社会主义建设的积极分子队伍。这支队伍的人数，在有些地方，大约占农村男女劳动力的百分之二十到三十。他们在社会主义建设的各个战线上，都是站在斗争的最前列。他们是党在农村中贯彻执行总路线，建设社会主义的主要依靠。他们是群众中的骨干，又是党联系群众的桥梁。没有这样一批积极分子，一年来的农业生产新高潮和大跃进是不可设想的。我们应该十分重视培养和发展壮大这支积极分子队伍，从政治、文化、技术三个方面去提高他们，并且把他们经常放在群众的监督之下，防止他们骄傲自满，脱离群众，使他们在党的领导下，成为带动广大农民，进行技术革命和文化革命，建设现代化的社会主义新农村的骨干。
    第六、种试验田。干部、农民和技术人员，三者合作，种试验田。这是一种最好的领导方法，是一条极其宝贵的创造。推广种试验田这种领导方法，是改变领导作风的重要关键。没有种试验田以前，群众说干部是“相公”；种了试验田，群众说干部是“好打头的”，根本改变了干群关系。种试验田，干部真正参加生产，领导生产，以自己的生产实践和试验结果来领导群众生产，这就大大克服了主观主义和强迫命令。种试验田，使干部由外行变成内行，是干部走向又红又专的门径。种试验田这种领导方法，广泛吸收社员参加社务管理和田间作业管理的方法，两者结合进行，相得益彰，这是走群众路线，实行民主办社的新创造，应该认真推广。
    第七、一年几次大检查。检查评比，是领导农业生产运动，推动高潮不断前进的一种非常成功的方法。毛主席在“工作方法六十条”中指示，中央一年检查四次，这是指的全面性的大检查。实际上，自从去冬新的生产高潮以来，大小检查已经多次了。各省、专、县的检查和乡、社自己的检查，次数就更多。每检查评比一次，就是对工作的一次推动和鼓舞。现在许多地方都在进行省、专、县、乡、社的五级大检查，对于当前的秋田管理、秋收准备和秋后农田基本建设的各项准备工作，也是很大的推动。每一个农业合作社，不仅要有先进的计划指标，还要有具体的增产措施，并且计划要落实到队，措施要落实到田，责任要落实到人，随时检查评比，抓两头，带中间，表扬先进的，消灭落后田，落后队。这是一项重要的经验，对于及时克服华而不实，浮而不深，粗而不细的毛病，具有决定性的作用。指标先进，措施具体，责任明确，随时检查评比，群众的信心越高，干劲越足。
    第八、书记挂帅，各方协作，全面规划，加强领导。农业生产不是孤立的，它需要工业的支援，它同商业的关系尤其密切，必须由“统帅三军”的各级党委的主要负责同志亲自领导。对于农林牧副渔，工农商学兵，农村中各项生产和文化福利事业都必须全面规划，统一安排。人人多能多技，亦农亦工亦兵，把农村劳动力更合理地组织起来，更充分地发挥劳动潜力。
    同时，还必须以党委为核心，组织地区之间、乡社之间、城乡工农之间、主管部门与有关部门之间的全面的共产主义大协作，各方面“拧成一股绳”，以生产大跃进为纲，带动农村各项社会主义建设事业全面大跃进。
