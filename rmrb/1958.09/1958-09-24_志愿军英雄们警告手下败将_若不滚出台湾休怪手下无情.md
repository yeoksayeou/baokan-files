Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd. The vast numbers of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who are closely watching the situation in the Taiwan Strait, are actively preparing to return home victoriously. In the past two days, they have held meetings to resolutely support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and angrily condemn Dulles' shameless lies attempting to further expand aggression against our country. These victorious heroes, who once fought alongside the Korean people on the Korean battlefield and forced the American aggressors to lower their heads, are today enraged by the constant war provocations of American imperialism. They unanimously roared with earth-shattering voices: Defeated foes, get out of the Taiwan area immediately! Otherwise, a greater defeat than in the Korean War, a devastating fate, awaits you!

The heroes of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, who routed the American aggressor troops and their running dog Syngman Rhee's army in the powerful Kumsong counterattack, pointed out that the American aggressors have occupied our country's territory of Taiwan, and Dulles has turned black and white upside down by calling us "aggressors." This is simply daydreaming and nonsense. The American aggressors are constantly increasing their military strength in the Taiwan area, actively preparing to provoke a new war, but they are turning a blind eye and telling us to "cease fire." This is completely the logic of a robber. The heroes angrily warned Eisenhower and Dulles not to forget the lessons of their disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield. They said that we have competed on the Korean battlefield, we have learned about your combat effectiveness, we have captured your prisoners, and we have also seen the ugly state of your soldiers surrendering. You paper tigers are not that great. If you do not recognize the times and insist on being enemies with the Chinese people, and if you do not quickly get out of the Taiwan area, then don't blame us for being ruthless. Lieutenant Liu Yunxian, who was awarded a first-class merit for his bravery in a battle in mid-July 1953 in which he and two platoons of soldiers repelled five enemy attacks on an unnamed high ground, killing or wounding more than 150 enemies, angrily said that Dulles, that mad dog, is baring its fangs and claws again. We have prepared the stick to beat the dog, and we will never let it off lightly if it comes again. Second-class hero Wang Huyuan said that Jinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan have been Chinese territory since ancient times. It is entirely China's internal affair for the Chinese people to liberate their own territory and punish the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and no interference from the United States is allowed. There is no "cease fire" issue here at all. If we are to talk about a "cease fire," then it means that American imperialism must get out of the Taiwan area and immediately stop playing with the flames of aggression against China.

At a meeting in a certain unit denouncing American aggression, more than 920 officers and soldiers wrote letters of determination on the spot to fight to the end to resist aggression and defend peace. Lieutenant Wei Bowen, a staff officer of a certain unit who persisted in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea and defend our homes for more than seven years and was awarded three merits, expressed his extreme anger, saying that he would never allow American imperialism to occupy our country's territory for a long time. After returning home, he would definitely respond to the call of the motherland and be ready to re-enter the new battle at any time under the sacred banner of defending the great motherland. Bao Fuxian, the platoon leader of the Fourth Company of a certain motor vehicle unit, who was awarded two merits in the War to Resist America and Aid Korea, recounted in a chat how he and his three comrades used captured American M1917 Browning machine guns to shoot down an American bomber that attempted to strafe our transport train. He said: Don't look at the American aggressors baring their fangs and claws, they are actually pretending to be "teachers." We have plenty of experience in defeating American soldiers. If the American aggressors insist on imposing war on us, we will definitely rise up to meet the challenge, use war to eliminate war, and smash the heads of the aggressors.

    志愿军英雄们警告手下败将
    若不滚出台湾休怪手下无情
    新华社平壤22日电　时刻密切注视着台湾海峡局势发展的中国人民志愿军广大官兵，在积极准备凯旋归国的同时，两日来纷纷集会，坚决拥护陈毅外长的声明，愤怒谴责杜勒斯企图继续扩大对我国侵略的无耻谰言。这些曾经在朝鲜战场上和朝鲜军民一起，把美国侵略者打得低下头来的胜利的英雄们，今天又被美帝国主义不断的战争挑衅激怒了。他们一致发出震撼天地的吼声：手下败将立即从台湾地区滚出去！要不，比朝鲜战争中更大的失败，毁灭性的命运在等待着你们！
    曾经在强大的金城反击战中，打得美国侵略军及其走狗李承晚军队狼狈溃逃的志愿军某部英雄们指出，美国侵略者侵占了我国领土台湾，杜勒斯竟颠倒黑白说我们是“侵略者”，这简直是白日说梦，胡说八道。美国侵略者不断在台湾地区增加军事力量，积极准备挑起新的战火，却睁眼瞎说叫我们“停火”。这完全是强盗的逻辑。英雄们愤怒地警告艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯，不要忘记在朝鲜战场上惨败的教训。他们说，在朝鲜战场上，我们较量过，领教过你们的战斗力，抓过你们的俘虏，也看到过你们的士兵投降的丑态，你这只纸老虎并不怎么样。如果你不识时务，坚持与中国人民为敌，不赶快从台湾地区滚出去，到时休怪我们手下无情。1953年7月中旬在痛击美李匪军的一次战斗中，荣立一等功的刘云仙中尉在叙述了当年他和两个班的战士在一座无名高地上打垮敌人五次进攻、杀伤敌人一百五十多名的战斗经过后愤怒地说，杜勒斯这条疯狗又张牙舞爪了。我们已准备好打狗的棍子，再来，决不轻饶它。二级英雄王虎元说，金门、马祖、台湾自古就是中国的领土，中国人民解放自己的领土和惩罚卖国贼蒋介石，完全是中国的内政，绝不容许美国干涉。这里也根本不存在“停火”问题。如果要说“停火”，那就是美帝国主义从台湾地区滚出去，立即停止向中国玩弄侵略战火。
    在某部声讨美国侵略罪行的大会上，九百二十多名官兵当场写了为反抗侵略、保卫和平战斗到底的决心书。坚持抗美援朝保家卫国斗争七年多、立过三次功的某部参谋魏博文中尉异常愤怒地表示，绝不容许美帝国主义长期侵占我国的领土，归国后，一定响应祖国的召唤，随时准备在保卫伟大祖国的神圣旗帜下，重新投入新的战斗。在抗美援朝战争中立了两次功的某汽车部队四连排长包福贤，在漫谈会上叙述了他和他的三个战友用缴获来的美国三○式步枪打落一架企图扫射我运输机车的美国轰炸机的故事。他说：别看美国侵略者张牙舞爪，其实是个装腔作势的“教师爷”。我们有的是打败美国兵的经验。如果美国侵略者一定要把战争强加在我们头上，我们一定奋起迎战，用战争来消灭战争，砸烂侵略者的脑袋。
