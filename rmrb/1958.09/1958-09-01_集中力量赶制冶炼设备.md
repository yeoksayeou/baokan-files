　　Concentrate Efforts to Speed Up the Production of Smelting Equipment
　　Jiangxi Adopts Several Measures to Make All Machinery Give Way to Metallurgical Machinery
　　Jilin, Lushun-Dalian and Other Places' Machinery Factories Launch Crash Production to Ensure Key Needs
    (Our Reporter Li Lianbin reports) Jiangxi Province has adopted various measures to rush and accelerate the manufacturing of metallurgical equipment, so that the "Iron and Steel Marshal" can quickly start up, complete the infrastructure construction of the iron and steel industry in a short period of time, and ensure the planned production of iron and steel. According to this year's iron and steel production plan, 2,500 sets of complete iron-making equipment and 87 sets of complete steel-making equipment need to be manufactured. The cranes, converters, rolling mills, generators, etc. required for this equipment are planned to be manufactured within two months. In order to accomplish this task, the Provincial Party Committee has recently adopted a series of effective measures: First, mobilize the province's machinery manufacturing forces to manufacture metallurgical equipment, and "make all machinery manufacturing give way to metallurgical machinery." Except for urgent needs, adopt the method of "a single cut" to completely stop production and concentrate all possible forces to manufacture metallurgical equipment; second, "metallurgical equipment first." The iron and steel produced in the province should first meet the needs of metallurgical equipment, and take care of other urgent needs under the principle of unified planning and distribution; third, carry out an industrial "anti-drought" movement, and deeply and extensively mobilize the masses to collect scrap iron, scrap steel, and scrap copper; fourth, use substitutes to replace iron and steel. Use ceramic pipes instead of steel pipes, use cement instead of steel for blower bases, and use lead instead of steel for blower blades; fifth, transfer all possible forces from various aspects to participate in the manufacture of metallurgical equipment. In order to make these measures more effective and ensure the accelerated manufacture of metallurgical equipment, the Provincial Party Committee decided that the first secretary of each level of the Party Committee should personally take charge, and on the industrial front, with iron and steel as the center, must currently focus on metallurgical manufacturing to ensure the smooth development of iron and steel production.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 31st) All machinery factories in Jilin Province, as well as machine repair workshops of non-mechanical factories and handicraft cooperatives, are rushing to manufacture complete sets of mechanical equipment for iron-making, steel-making, and steel-rolling. They guarantee that in the next month or so, they will produce 300 to 350 iron-making furnaces with volumes of 13 and 28 cubic meters, 31 sets of steel-making converters, and 15 sets of rolling mills.
    All units have made supporting the construction of iron and steel plants and small iron-making furnaces as their primary task. After receiving the task, each factory immediately found drawings, traced drawings, printed drawings, and carried out trial production or put materials into production overnight. The Jilin Provincial Farm Tool Factory also decided to complete the October task ahead of schedule in September, and increase the output of blowers from 50 to 100. In order to save time, the workers had their families deliver meals to the workshop, and no one left their machines to persist in production. Changchun City organized hundreds of units, including large factories such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and handicraft cooperatives with three or five people, to divide the work and cooperate in order to fully tap production potential and rush to manufacture more than 1,400 sets of metallurgical equipment.
    In completing this urgent task, the existing iron and steel raw materials in the province are uniformly allocated and used by the province to ensure key needs. All factories also eliminated the phenomenon of acting independently and blocking each other, and opened warehouses to share resources.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian, 31st) The Lushun-Dalian machinery industry is rushing to manufacture equipment for the iron and steel industry in various provinces and regions across the country. These include equipment for blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, converters, and coke ovens, as well as rolling mills and mining equipment.
    Recently, the iron and steel industry across the country has developed very rapidly. According to the urgent needs of various places, the Lushun-Dalian machinery industry has accepted orders for more than 1,000 tons of metallurgical equipment and has repeatedly revised its leap forward plan.
    In order to quickly manufacture these equipment, the entire Lushun-Dalian industry is now showing a vigorous spirit of communist cooperation. The Dalian Mining and Metallurgical Vehicle Factory, which manufactures the most metallurgical equipment, is receiving a flood of orders, and customers are asking for early delivery, and the tasks are overwhelming. More than a dozen factories in Lushun-Dalian immediately provided support from all directions after hearing this news. The Dalian General Machinery Factory and the Dalian Machinery Manufacturing No. 4 Factory immediately unloaded the parts they were cutting from the machine tools and replaced them with the parts for the metallurgical equipment of the Dalian Mining and Metallurgical Vehicle Factory. Workers in the mechanical processing workshop of the Dalian Chemical Plant sacrificed their holidays and took the initiative to work, processing and cooperating on parts for the Dalian Mining and Metallurgical Vehicle Factory. The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory and the Dalian Crane Factory immediately sent 70 sand mold workers and pneumatic shovel workers when they heard that the Dalian Mining and Metallurgical Vehicle Factory was short of casting manpower.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 31st) The Kunming Mining and Metallurgical Machinery Factory is using the method of ants gnawing at bones to rush to manufacture dozens of smelting equipment and rolling mills for various places in the province.
    This factory could only manufacture and repair geological exploration equipment such as drilling rigs and water pumps, and has only recently undertaken the trial production of steel-making and steel-rolling equipment. During the trial production, many production teams automatically changed the three-shift system to a two-shift system. In August, the factory workers successively built nine indigenous boring machines, indigenous milling machines, and indigenous vertical lathes for processing smelting equipment, easing the tense situation of insufficient equipment.
    Now, this factory has used small machines and self-made indigenous machines to produce 16 sets of smelting equipment, which have been transported to various places in the province; some areas have already used it to make steel.

　　集中力量赶制冶炼设备
　　江西采取几项措施叫一切机械给冶金机械让路
　　吉林和旅大等地机械厂突击生产保证重点需要
    本报讯　记者李连斌报道　江西省采取各种措施赶制和加速制造冶金设备，以使“钢铁元帅”迅速上马，在短期内完成钢铁工业的基建任务，以保证按计划生产钢铁。按今年钢铁生产计划需要制造成套炼铁设备二千五百套、成套炼钢设备八十七套。这些设备所需吊车、转炉、轧钢机、发电机等，准备在两个月的时间内全部制造出来。为了完成这一任务，省委最近采取了一系列有效措施：第一，动员全省机械制造力量制造冶金设备，叫“一切机械制造给冶金机械让路”，除了急需的以外，采取“一刀砍”的办法，全部停止生产，集中一切可能集中的力量制造冶金设备；第二，“冶金设备第一”。全省生产的钢铁首先满足冶金设备的需要，在统一计划和分配的原则下照顾其他急需；第三，开展工业“抗旱”运动，深入地广泛地发动群众搜集废铁废钢废铜；第四，用代用品代替钢铁。用陶瓷管代替钢管、用水泥代替鼓风机座用钢、鼓风机翼以铅代钢；第五，抽调各方面可能利用的力量，参与冶金设备的制造。为使这些措施收到更大效果，保证加快冶金设备的制造，省委决定：各级党委第一书记亲自负责，在工业战线上以钢铁为中心，当前对冶金制造必须抓起来，以保证钢铁生产的顺利发展。
    据新华社长春31日电　吉林省所有的机械厂和非机械工厂的机修车间、手工业社，正在突击赶制炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等成套的机械设备。它们保证在最近一个月左右的时间内，要拿出三百座到三百五十座十三和二十八立方公尺的炼铁炉，三十一套炼钢转炉，十五套轧钢机。
    各单位已经把支援建设钢铁厂、小型炼铁炉作为首要任务。各厂接到任务后，连夜找图、描图、晒图和进行试制或投料生产。吉林省农具厂还决定把10月份任务提前在9月内完成，鼓风机的产量由五十台增加到一百台。工人们为争取时间，让家里人把饭送到车间，谁都不离开机床坚持进行生产。长春市把上百个单位，其中包括像第一汽车制造厂这样的大厂和三、五个人的手工业社，全部组织起来，分工协作，以便充分挖掘生产潜力，赶制一千四百多台（套）冶金设备。
    在完成这批紧急任务中，全省现有的钢铁原材料统一由省负责调拨使用，以保证重点需要。各厂也消除各自为政、相互封锁的现象，做到打开仓库、互通有无。
    新华社旅大31日电　旅大机械工业正在为全国各省区的钢铁工业赶制装备。其中有高炉、平炉、转炉和炼焦炉设备，有轧钢机，有开矿设备。
    最近全国钢铁工业发展得很猛，旅大机械工业根据各地迫切要求，又接受了一千多吨冶金设备的订货，一再修订了跃进计划。
    为了把这些设备迅速赶制出来，现在整个旅大工业表现出了生气勃勃的共产主义协作精神。制造冶金设备最多的大连工矿车辆厂，货主盈门，纷纷要求提前交货，任务应接不暇。旅大十多个工厂听到这个消息，马上四面八方给予支援。大连通用机器厂、大连机械制造四厂，立刻把自己正在切削的部件从机床上卸下来，换上大连工矿车辆厂冶金设备的部件。大连化工厂机械加工车间工人牺牲了休假日，主动上班，为大连工矿车辆厂加工协作部件。大连机车车辆厂和大连起重机器厂听到大连工矿车辆厂铸造的人力不足，马上就派去了七十名砂型工人和风铲工人。
    据新华社昆明31日电　昆明矿山冶金机械厂正在用蚂蚁啃骨头的办法，为省内各地赶制几十台冶炼设备和轧钢机。
    这个厂原来只能制造和修理钻机、水泵等地质勘探设备，最近才承担炼钢和轧钢设备的试制任务。试制中，很多生产小组自动把三班制改成了二班制。8月，全厂职工先后造出加工冶炼设备的土镗床、土铣床、土落地车床等九台，缓和了设备不足的紧张局面。
    现在，这个厂用小机器和自造的土机器已经制出了十六套冶炼设备，运往全省各地；有的地区已利用它炼出钢了。
