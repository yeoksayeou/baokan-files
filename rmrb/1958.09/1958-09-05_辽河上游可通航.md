    Upstream Liao River to Become Navigable
    The first large-scale ship lock in Liaoning Province has begun construction at Zhuajia Gangzi on the right bank of the Liao River in Tai'an County. After the completion of this ship lock, the 200-kilometer-long waterway from the upstream Julu River to Tai'an on the Liao River will become navigable. The Liu River, Jiugu River, and Raoyang River within Tai'an County can also be connected to the Liao River to form a water transportation network. (Fu Xing, Meng Qingzhen)

    辽河上游可通航
    辽宁省第一座大型船闸，已在台安县辽河右岸爪茄岗子动工兴建。这个船闸建成后，辽河上游巨流河至台安之间二百多公里长的航道可以通航。台安县境内的柳河、九股河和绕阳河等也可以同辽河联系起来，形成一个水运网。　（傅兴　孟庆祯）
