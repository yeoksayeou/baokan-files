Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 5th. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio told reporters from the Indonesian News Agency today that China's declaration of its territorial sea width as twelve nautical miles "is in line with the needs of the current era."

He said that Indonesia and Iceland have respectively stipulated their territorial sea width as twelve nautical miles, also in accordance with the needs of the current era. He pointed out that the past regulation of territorial sea width as three nautical miles was determined based on the technological conditions at the time.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 5th. "The Chinese government's statement on China's territorial sea demonstrates the determination of the great China's 600 million people to completely smash the provocations of the U.S. government and the Chiang Kai-shek clique," said Czechoslovakian Radio on the evening of the 4th in its commentary on the Chinese government's statement on the territorial sea. Before issuing the commentary, the radio also broadcast a summary of the Chinese government's statement.

The commentary said that the Chinese government's statement has brought this important Far Eastern issue into a new stage. The commentary pointed out that although the Chinese government has sought various peaceful means to resolve the Taiwan issue for several years, it has never given up its sovereignty over Taiwan and its nearby islands. The statement once again demonstrated the Chinese government's determination to eventually recover its territory.

The commentary pointed out that the Chinese government's statement does not threaten anyone; they are acting entirely in accordance with their legal rights and exercising their own sovereignty.

The commentary condemned the fact that the U.S.-Chiang clique will conduct a large-scale military exercise in the Taiwan Strait. It concluded that such a blatant military provocation cannot be tolerated by any independent country.

On the 5th, all Czechoslovakian newspapers published the Chinese government's statement on the territorial sea.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 5th. All Bulgarian central newspapers today published the statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China regarding China's territorial sea on the fourth page in a prominent position.

"Otechestven Front" published a commentary on this statement. The commentary said that this decision has significant political and economic implications. This decision also helps to determine the legal conditions that are absolutely necessary for the security and defense of great China. The Chinese government's decision clearly reflects the sovereign will of the Chinese people, who have the inalienable supreme right to be masters of their own territory. This decision is based on historical, economic, political, and defense considerations. This decision has all the necessary basis in international law and legal practice.

The newspaper emphasized that the government of 600 million Chinese people has made a very important decision. Every country that respects the rights and independence of others will unconditionally consider this decision. The Chinese people, like all autonomous people, want to control their own territory. This is the requirement of international law. This is the will of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people will realize their will regardless of everything. The commentary concluded that free people, including the Bulgarian people, welcome this decision of the Government of the People's Republic of China.

    评论说，中国政府的声明使这一重要的远东问题进入了新的阶段。评论指出，虽然几年来中国政府曾寻求各种和平解决台湾问题的手段，但是中国政府从来没有放弃对于台湾及其附近岛屿的主权。声明再一次表明了中国政府最终要收复自己领土的决心。
    评论指出，中国政府的声明并不威胁任何人，他们完全是按照自己法定权利行事，是行使着他们自己的主权。
    评论谴责了美蒋将在台湾海峡进行军事总演习的事实。它最后说，这样一种明显的军事挑衅是任何一个独立国家所决不能容忍的。
