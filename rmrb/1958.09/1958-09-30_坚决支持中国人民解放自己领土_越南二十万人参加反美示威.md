Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 29th: According to incomplete statistics, as of now, nearly 200,000 people of all classes and ethnic groups, as well as overseas Chinese, in North Vietnam have participated in rallies and demonstrations against American aid to China.

These rallies and demonstrations were held in response to the call from the Vietnam Fatherland Front National Committee, the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, and the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace.

All the rallies passed resolutions and wrote letters to the Chinese Embassy, expressing their firm support for the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands and oppose the provocations of American imperialism.

The more than 900 patients and staff of the Hanoi Central Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Institute said in their letter that the tense situation created by American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area not only threatens China but also directly threatens the peace and independence of Vietnam; we are willing to join hands with the Chinese people to defend peace and defend our socialist motherland.

The Haiphong City Committee of the Vietnam Democratic Party wrote to the China Democratic National Construction Association, expressing their support for the Chinese people's struggle, saying in the letter that we deeply feel the Chinese people's indignation at the provocative acts of American imperialism.

All the staff and workers of the Forestry, Native Produce and Processing Factory of the Vietnam Ministry of Commerce said in their letter that the actions of American imperialism are unjust; it will certainly be driven out of Taiwan by the Chinese people and will certainly be driven out of South Vietnam by the Vietnamese people.

According to the Vietnam News Agency, a group of priests from the Catholic Center of Nam Dinh Province in Vietnam recently held a symposium to discuss the domestic and international situation. These priests unanimously believed that the American provocations in the Taiwan Strait, the intervention in South Vietnam, and the dispatch of troops to the Middle East were all acts of aggression.

    新华社河内29日电  据不完全统计，截至目前为止，越南北方已经有近二十万各阶层、各民族人民和华侨参加了反美援华的集会和示威游行。
    这些集会和示威游行是北越各地人民热烈响应越南祖国战线全国委员会、越南亚非人民团结委员会和越南保卫世界和平委员会的号召而举行的。
    所有集会都通过决议和写信给中国大使馆，表示坚决支持中国人民为解放台湾和沿海岛屿、反对美帝国主义挑衅的正义斗争。
    河内中央结核病防治院的九百多名病员和工作人员在来信中说，美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区制造的紧张局势不但威胁着中国，也直接威胁着越南的和平、独立；我们愿同中国人民并肩保卫和平，保卫社会主义祖国。
    越南民主党海防市委员会写信给中国民主建国会，表示支持中国人民的斗争，信中说，我们深刻体会到中国人民对美帝国主义的挑衅行为的愤慨。
    越南商业部林土产加工厂全体职工在来信中说，美帝国主义的行动是非正义的；它一定会被中国人民赶出台湾，也一定会被越南人民赶出南越。
    据越南通讯社消息，越南天主教中心南定省的一部分神父最近也举行了座谈会，讨论国内外形势。这些神父一致认为，美国在台湾海峡地区的挑衅、对南越的干涉和出兵中东都是侵略行为。
