Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: China's first experimental atomic reactor and cyclotron, built in the suburbs of Beijing, were officially handed over for production on the eve of the great ninth anniversary of the National Day! The first batch of domestically produced radioactive isotopes has already been produced from this atomic pile; neutrons and two types of rays drawn from the channels in the middle of the atomic pile, as well as particles emitted from the accelerator at a speed of 34,000 kilometers per second, have been used for atomic nuclear physics research. This is a decisive stage in China's development of atomic energy science and the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, a victory for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship.

This morning, a grand handover ceremony was held at the site. Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council, Nie Rongzhen, Vice Premier and Director of the Science Planning Commission, Lin Boqu, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Zhang Wentian, alternate member of the Political Bureau, Wu Yuzhang and Xu Teli, members of the CPC Central Committee, Xie Juezai, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee, Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, heads of various state departments, people's organizations, and democratic parties, leaders of the People's Liberation Army, and nearly two thousand people from the capital's scientific and technological circles and staff of the Atomic Energy Research Institute attended the ceremony.

Attending this grand ceremony were Professor Yefremov, Deputy Director of the Soviet Atomic Energy Utilization Administration, Academician Alikhanov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Academician Vinogradov, who came specially from the Soviet Union, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea headed by Vice Premier Li Zhouyuan, who are currently visiting China, Mr. Suvi Rau, an Indian scientist who came specially to China to attend the ceremony, and Soviet experts who helped China build the atomic pile and accelerator.

Sudarikov, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, and ambassadors and diplomats from various countries in China were also invited to attend the ceremony.

The ceremony began under the chairmanship of Zhang Jingfu, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. After the national anthem was played, Nie Rongzhen, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the National Acceptance Committee, signed the acceptance certificate and delivered a speech. Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen pointed out that the completion and transfer to production of the experimental atomic pile and cyclotron will promote the rapid development of China's atomic energy science and technology; this major event meets the requirements of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture: it not only serves today's great leap forward in industry and agriculture, but also serves the higher development of productivity tomorrow; our policy is that everyone should engage in atomic energy science, and we will build more atomic piles and accelerators. Vice Premier Nie emphasized that China's development of atomic energy science and technology is for the benefit of mankind, not to harm mankind. He then strongly condemned the US imperialists' criminal acts of using atomic energy science and technology for aggression and war purposes, saying: The Chinese people will never tolerate the US imperialists infringing upon the sovereignty and territory of other countries and attempting to interfere in the Chinese people's recovery of coastal islands and the liberation of Taiwan through atomic blackmail and war provocations. Vice Premier Nie warned the US imperialists: In today's era, atomic weapons are not something that the US imperialists can exclusively possess and monopolize. Finally, on behalf of the State Council, Nie Rongzhen thanked the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people for helping China build the atomic pile and accelerator. At the same time, he expressed commendation and condolences to all the staff of the Atomic Energy Research Institute who had overcome difficulties in every possible way and worked diligently.

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said at the ceremony: As you can see, atomic energy science and technology has laid a solid foundation in our country, and its future development will be adapted to the leap forward in production and construction, which will be very rapid. The draft of the twelve-year long-range plan for the development of science and technology formulated in 1956, including atomic energy research, can be basically completed five to seven years ahead of schedule.

Yefremov also spoke at the ceremony. He said: The Soviet people watch the achievements of their Chinese brothers with love and pride. Now no force can turn back the wheel of history. The American aggressors are still trying to revive the ashes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which is completely wishful thinking; the Soviet people fully support Comrade Khrushchev's warning to Eisenhower - an attack on China is an attack on the Soviet Union.

Sudarikov, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, spoke last. He said that the atomic reactor and accelerator put into production today are one of the many major things that symbolize the indestructible friendship between the Soviet Union and China and the grand prospects for further development.

After the ceremony, everyone visited the atomic pile and accelerator in batches. Some guests watched the newly produced Chinese film "Leap Forward into the Atomic Age".

    党的领导的胜利  中苏友谊的结晶
    原子堆和加速器移交生产
    聂荣臻副总理说：我们的方针是大家办原子能科学，我们还要建立更多的原子堆和加速器。他警告美帝国主义：原子武器不是美帝国主义所能够独占和垄断得了的。
    新华社27日讯  建设在北京郊外的我国第一座实验性原子反应堆和回旋加速器，在伟大的国庆九周年前夕正式移交生产了！第一批中国自制的放射性同位素已经从这座原子堆里生产出来；从原子堆横腰里的孔道中引出来的中子和两种射线以及从加速器发出的每秒三万四千公里速度的粒子已经被用来进行原子核物理研究。这是我国发展原子能科学以及和平利用原子能事业中有决定性意义的一个阶段，这是中国共产党领导的胜利，是中苏友谊的结晶。
    今天上午，在现场举行了隆重的移交生产典礼。国务院副总理陈毅，副总理兼科学规划委员会主任聂荣臻，中共中央政治局委员林伯渠，候补委员张闻天，中共中央委员吴玉章、徐特立，中共中央候补委员谢觉哉，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通，国家各部门、各人民团体、各民主党派的负责人、解放军首长以及首都科学技术界人士、原子能研究所的工作人员等近两千人参加了典礼。
    莅临这个隆重典礼的有特地从苏联前来的苏联原子能利用总局副局长叶夫列莫夫教授、苏联科学院阿里哈诺夫院士、维诺格拉多夫院士、正在我国访问的以李周渊副首相为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团、特地来我国参加典礼的印度科学家苏维·劳先生、帮助我国建造原子堆和加速器的苏联专家等。
    苏联驻华大使馆参赞苏达利柯夫和各国驻华大使和外交官员也应邀参加了典礼。
    典礼在中国科学院副院长张劲夫主持下开始。奏国歌后，国务院副总理、国家验收委员会主任聂荣臻签字验收，并讲话。聂荣臻副总理指出：实验性原子堆和回旋加速器的建成和移交生产，将促进我国原子能科学技术获得迅速发展；这件大事正是适应了工农业大跃进的要求：它不仅为今天的工农业大跃进服务，而且为明天的生产力更高的发展服务；我们的方针是大家办原子能科学，我们还要建立更多的原子堆和加速器。聂副总理强调说，我国发展原子能科学技术是用来造福人类而不是危害人类的。他接着强硬地谴责了美帝国主义把原子能科学技术用于侵略和战争目的的罪恶行为，他说：美帝国主义侵犯别国主权和领土、妄想用原子讹诈和战争挑衅来干涉我国人民收复沿海岛屿和解放台湾，中国人民是决不能容忍的。聂副总理警告美帝国主义：在今天的时代，原子武器并不是美帝国主义所能够独占和垄断得了的。聂荣臻最后代表国务院感谢帮助我国建造原子堆和加速器的苏联共产党，苏联政府和苏联人民。同时对千方百计克服困难、付出辛勤劳动的原子能研究所的全体职工表示嘉奖和慰问。
    中国科学院院长郭沫若在典礼仪式中说；大家可以看到，原子能科学技术在我国已经奠定了坚实的基础，它今后的发展将会同生产建设的跃进相适应，是十分迅速的。1956年制定的发展科学技术十二年远景规划草案，包括原子能的研究在内，能够提前五年至七年基本上完成。
    叶夫列莫夫也在典礼仪式上讲了话。他说：苏联人民怀着热爱和骄傲的心情注视着中国兄弟的成就。现在已经没有任何力量能够把历史的车轮倒转。美国侵略者还在妄图让蒋介石匪帮的死灰复燃，这是完全枉费心机；苏联人民完全拥护赫鲁晓夫同志向艾森豪威尔提出的警告——对中国的进攻就是对苏联的进攻。
    苏联驻华大使馆参赞苏达利柯夫最后讲话。他说，今天投入生产的原子反应堆和加速器是象征着苏中不可摧毁的友谊和进一步发展宏伟远景的许许多多重大事物中的一个。
    礼成后，大家分批参观了原子堆和加速器。一部分来宾观看了我国新出产的影片“向原子能时代跃进”。
