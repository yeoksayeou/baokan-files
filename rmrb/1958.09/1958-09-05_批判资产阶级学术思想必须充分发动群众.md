　　Criticizing Bourgeois Academic Thought Requires Fully Mobilizing the Masses
　　Lin Mo
    Recently, under the leadership of the Party, the National Agricultural Economics Science Symposium was held in Beijing. Using Marxism-Leninism and the thought of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong as weapons, it comprehensively and profoundly exposed and criticized the so-called agricultural economics "theories" of the imperialist element Buck and his disciples in China. A struggle between two roads was launched in the academic field, and a significant victory was achieved.

    In the great nationwide rectification movement, although bourgeois academic thought has been further criticized, systematic criticism is still beginning in various academic fields. For many bourgeois intellectuals, especially some senior "experts" among them, the question of whether to take the proletarian road or the bourgeois road in academic thought has not been completely resolved.

    The great leap forward in agricultural production in our country is constantly creating amazing achievements and new world records. These achievements have shattered many outdated concepts and brought about revolutionary changes in agricultural production and agricultural economics science. In order for agricultural economics scientists in our country to understand this situation, catch up quickly, keep pace with the times, and serve the great leap forward in agriculture, it is necessary to launch mass academic criticism.

    This National Agricultural Economics Science Symposium was very successful and fruitful. It criticized various bourgeois thoughts in agricultural economics, educated many people, destroyed the old and established the new, and provided a good start for future criticism. The main experience behind such success, aside from closely relying on the leadership of the Party, is the full mobilization and reliance on the masses, and following the mass line. Those who participated in the battle included not only professors and experts, but also many students and young teachers, cadres from practical work positions, and laboring farmers from agricultural cooperatives. The latter were the main force in the battle. At the meeting, some systematically criticized the set of bourgeois academic ideas in agricultural economics point by point, some thoroughly exposed their old foundations, and some used concrete and vivid real-world materials to give them powerful rebuttals. The reasoning was thorough, the debates were heated, and they were besieged from several directions, making it impossible for bourgeois scholars to hide. In the end, they had no choice but to surrender and admit defeat in the face of truth.

    In order to achieve a complete victory in the struggle between the two roads in the fields of philosophy and social sciences, all disciplines, especially literature, history, philosophy, economics, and other disciplines, must launch mass criticisms of bourgeois academic thought. Some people still have some doubts about whether the mass line can be followed in criticizing bourgeois academic thought, which is completely wrong. Criticizing bourgeois academic thought and establishing proletarian academic thought is a profound ideological revolution. It is far from possible to complete this task with only a few experts and scholars engaging in self-criticism and mutual criticism. Only by fully mobilizing the masses, following the mass line, and launching a massive mass-based climax of criticism in various academic fields can we achieve "promoting the proletarian and eliminating the bourgeois." To mobilize the masses, it is first necessary to liberate thoughts and break down superstitions. Bourgeois academic thought is not mysterious or superior. Only bourgeois scholars deliberately disguise it, complicate it, and mystify it in order to play tricks and scare the people. If it is exposed, workers, peasants, and young students can all participate in academic criticism, and they can criticize very well. The facts have now proved this point. Science comes from practice. Practice is the standard for testing truth. Whether agricultural economics science is correct or wrong, revolutionary or counter-revolutionary, cadres working in rural areas and the working people see very clearly, and they are most powerful when criticizing it. Therefore, academic criticism must never be regarded as the business of a few experts and scholars. Students can criticize professors, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and cadres engaged in practical work can criticize scholars even more. As long as there is the leadership of the Party and the power of the masses is fully mobilized, using Marxism-Leninism and the thought of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong as weapons, any bourgeois academic thought in any discipline or field can be broken and defeated.

    Currently, a mass movement to criticize bourgeois academic thought is rising in many institutions of higher education and scientific research institutions. Many students and young teachers and young researchers bravely rise up to criticize the bourgeois academic thought of some professors and experts. They write articles and speak at discussion meetings with supporting material and clear viewpoints. They are very lively and powerful. After going deep into reality and participating in labor, college students all over the country, under the leadership of the Party, have become a vital force in launching fierce attacks on bourgeois academic thought. This new force, nurtured under the education of the Party, has great significance for the current teaching reform in institutions of higher education and the reform of research institutions. This is a gratifying new phenomenon that has emerged from the further deepening of the socialist revolution on the ideological front. It must be supported and assisted with great enthusiasm. Philosophy and social science workers outside of schools and scientific research institutions must actively participate in mass criticism. What attitude should be adopted towards the masses rising up to criticize academic "authorities"? Is it to actively participate, or to stand by and watch, or to be critical in every possible way? This will be a serious test for every philosophy and social science worker.

　　批判资产阶级学术思想必须充分发动群众
　　林沫
    最近在党的领导下，在北京举行了全国农业经济科学讨论会，以马克思列宁主义，以党中央和毛泽东同志的思想为武器，全面深刻地揭发和批判了帝国主义分子卜凯及其在中国的门徒们的一套所谓农业经济学“理论”，在学术领域中开展了两条道路的斗争，取得了重大的胜利。
    在伟大的全民整风运动中，资产阶级的学术思想虽然已经进一步受到批判，但是在各个学术领域中，系统的批判工作，还正在开始。许多资产阶级的知识分子，特别是其中的一些高级“专家”，在学术思想上，要走无产阶级道路还是要走资产阶级道路，这个问题并未完全解决。
    我国农业生产的大跃进，正在不断创造出惊人的成绩和世界新纪录。这些成就，打破了许多陈旧的观念，使农业生产和农业经济科学起了革命性的变化。为了使我国的农业经济科学工作者，认识这一形势，急起直追，赶上时代的脚步，为农业大跃进服务，就必须开展群众性的学术批判。
    这次全国农业经济科学讨论会，开得很好，收获很大。批判了农业经济学中形形色色的资产阶级思想，教育了很多人，有破有立，使今后的批判工作，有了一个良好的开端。所以有这样的收获，除了紧紧依靠党的领导之外，最主要的一条经验，就是充分发动群众和依靠群众，走群众路线。参加战斗的不仅有教授、专家，而且有许多学生和青年教师、来自实际工作岗位的干部和农业社的劳动农民。而后者是战斗的主力。会上对农业经济方面的一套资产阶级学术思想，有的针对各个论点进行系统的批判，有的则从根子上揭穿了他们的老底子，有的则运用具体生动的现实材料，给以有力的驳斥。说理透彻，辩论热烈，几路围攻，使资产阶级学者无法隐身躲藏，最后不得不在真理面前投降服输。
    为了取得哲学社会科学学术思想领域中的两条道路斗争的彻底胜利，各个学科，特别是文学、历史、哲学、经济等学科都要对资产阶级的学术思想展开群众性的批判。有人对于批判资产阶级学术思想是否可以走群众路线这个问题，还有若干怀疑，这是完全错误的。批判资产阶级学术思想，树立无产阶级的学术思想，是一个深刻的思想上的大革命。只有少数专家、学者进行自我批判和相互批判，是远不能完成这个任务的。充分发动群众，走群众路线，在各个学术领域兴起一个声势浩大的群众性的批判高潮，才能达到“兴无灭资”。要发动群众，首先要解放思想，破除迷信。资产阶级的学术思想，并没有什么神秘和高超之处。只有资产阶级的学者们，为着调弄玄虚，吓唬人民，才故意把它伪装起来，弄得复杂化和神秘化。如果把它揭穿开来，工人、农民、青年学生，都能参加学术批判，而且能够批判得非常好。现在事实已经证明了这一点。科学来自实践。实践是检验真理的标准。农业经济科学是正确的还是错误的，是革命的还是反革命的，作农村工作的干部和劳动人民看得很清楚，批判起来也最有力量。因此，绝不能把学术批判当成少数专家学者的事。学生可以批判教授，广大的工农和实际工作的干部更可以批判学者。只要有党的领导，充分地发动了群众的力量，以马克思列宁主义，以党中央和毛泽东同志的思想作武器，不论对任何一门学科或任何一个领域内的资产阶级学术思想，都是可以攻破和打垮的。
    现在许多高等学校和科学研究机关群众性的批判资产阶级学术思想的运动正在兴起。许多学生和青年教师、青年研究人员勇敢地起来批判一些教授专家的资产阶级学术思想，他们写文章，在讨论会上发言，有材料，有观点，非常生动，非常有力。全国各地的大学生深入实际，参加劳动以后，在党的领导下已经成为向资产阶级学术思想进行猛攻的一支生力军。这一支在党的教养下成长起来的新生力量，对于当前高等学校的教学改革和研究机关的改革具有重大的意义。这是思想战线上的社会主义革命进一步深刻化所出现的可喜的新气象。对此必须以极大的热情给以支持和帮助。学校和科学研究机关以外的哲学社会科学工作者，都要积极起来参加群众性的批判工作。对群众起来批判学术“权威”这件事，采取什么态度：是积极起来参加呢，还是袖手旁观或者百般挑剔呢？这对于每一个哲学社会科学工作者来说，将是一个严重考验。
