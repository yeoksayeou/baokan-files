Miracles Can Only Happen Today
—How Wuyuan County, Jiangxi Province, Eradicated Schistosomiasis
By Our Correspondent Zhong Ming

For many years, schistosomiasis tormented the people of Wuyuan County. But in the old society, people could only endure endless pain and death. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, schistosomiasis has been eradicated here.

This is a narrow valley area, about twenty li long from east to west, including the existing natural villages of Dongjia, Luxia, Changlin, Yanxia, Shiling, Xiaoyanqian, and Hengting. According to legend, before the occurrence of schistosomiasis, this place was prosperous and the harvests were quite good. It is impossible to trace when schistosomiasis began. According to the county chronicles: In the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, a "sudden outbreak of 'gu disease' (i.e., schistosomiasis) occurred, and the people were mostly sick and unable to engage in production, and there were deaths every year." But the feudal ruling class attributed the reason to the peasants opening limestone mountains and damaging the "dragon veins," resulting in "the earth's veins being scorched and withered, and suffering deeply." Therefore, they "severely punished them on the one hand and issued prohibitions on the other," making the peasants even more miserable. Later, the Kuomintang reactionary government, in addition to conscripting soldiers, demanding money, and demanding grain, was indifferent to the suffering of the people. As a result, more and more people became infected with schistosomiasis, and finally, in the 1930s, there was another acute epidemic. According to the memories of the surviving old people, more than a dozen people died every day at that time. In less than a year, the five villages of Tuqiaotou, Lijia, Jinjiajing, Lengshuishan, etc., each with more than a hundred households, were completely wiped out. Now, the remaining seven villages have only a few dozen people in total, and most of them are women who do not work in the fields, and they are also infected with varying degrees of schistosomiasis. At the time of liberation, the total population here, including men from other places and children, was only 111 households with 347 people. Everyone was sallow and emaciated, short and small, hunchbacked and bloated. Because of the lack of labor, the fields were barren and overgrown with weeds and miscellaneous trees, the houses were dilapidated, and there were ruins everywhere. The peasants planted extensively but harvested little, lived on bran and vegetables, and the miserable situation was unbearable to witness. At that time, just after liberation, medical conditions in all aspects were not yet available. In order to help the people restore production, the government often transferred labor from nearby areas to provide support.

In November 1955, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued a call to eliminate schistosomiasis. The schistosomiasis prevention and control organization, led by the county party secretary and the county head, was announced, and a schistosomiasis prevention and control team composed of seven specialized medical personnel was dispatched here in early 1956 to carry out prevention and control work. At first, people thought that treating the masses would be very smooth, but who knew how many difficulties and obstacles there would be for people who had suffered for a long time and accepted the dictates of fate! Explaining to the masses how schistosomiasis came about, saying that snail fever parasites lived on the snails, and when people touched it, it would burrow into the human body, and then turn into hairy larvae in the blood vessels to harm people... no one believed it. People said: "We have never seen any hairy larvae on the snails, unless the snails can burrow into people's stomachs!" Some simply said: "Forget it, the feng shui here is bad, you can't cure our disease!" If you want to talk more, no one will listen. However, the prevention and control team was not intimidated by the difficulties. After research, they put feces, worm eggs, and live snails and larvae under a microscope and sent them to the masses to see, using facts to convince the masses. At this time, people were shocked: "So these little hairy worms burrowed into our stomachs!" The ideas of believing in "dragon veins," "feng shui," and "fate" for many years were shaken, and many people began to send feces for examination according to the doctor's instructions. After examination, of the 347 people here, except for those who had arrived from other places for a short time, 208 people had schistosomiasis.

The first hurdle was broken, can the disease of many years be cured? People doubted again. No one was willing to inject antimony, and after repeated mobilization, old lady He Gui'e from Shiling Village decided to send her son and daughter to try it out. Beyond her expectations, in just over a month, not only did the ascites disappear completely, but her 25-year-old son, who used to look like an 11- or 12-year-old child, thin and small, unable to even lift a bucket of water, began to develop at this time, and his weight increased significantly. Her 21-year-old daughter, who had never had menstruation, also had menstruation at this time. Everyone in the village knew about it, and old lady He was even happier. She said to everyone she met: "The doctor is more effective than immortals." Suddenly, it caused a sensation throughout the valley, and people who wanted treatment came to the door on their own initiative. Patients had to be treated continuously, and the doctors often worked all day and stayed up all night. During the treatment period, the state also issued relief funds to patients with difficult lives. The county party secretary, the county head, and the director of the health bureau often came to check and supervise the work and comfort the patients. People were moved to tears.

To eliminate schistosomiasis, treatment must also be combined with comprehensive preventive measures such as eliminating snails, managing feces, and managing water sources, which can also be strongly supported by the masses. Under the guidance of medical personnel, men, women, and children all went out together to burn snails, kill snails with medicine, and kill snails with lime, just like encircling and suppressing the enemy. The lime kilns that had not been burned for many years started burning lime in large quantities again. In the fields, in the grass, and even in the cracks of the stones, if snails were found, people would not let one go. In addition, old ditches were filled in, new ditches were dug, spring water was drawn down from the mountains through connected bamboo pipes, water storage pools and water pools for washing clothes and vegetables were established in various villages to keep the water source clean. In terms of fecal management, small public toilets or centralized manure tanks were initially established, and the feces were handed over to special personnel for management, and stored in sealed containers regularly to kill the worm eggs before being used as fertilizer. Gradually, everyone developed the habit of paying attention to hygiene and cleanliness.

Year after year of hard work, one patient after another recovered their health, and the face of this place also changed accordingly. By April 25 this year, after re-examination and appraisal by the Jiangxi Provincial and Shangrao Prefectural Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Work Leading Group, it was proved that schistosomiasis had been completely eradicated here.

In just over two years, the people here were forever freed from poverty, weakness, and death. The barren land here in the past has all been reclaimed. Sesame, soybeans, and tall corn are planted everywhere on the dry land on the hillsides. The verdant tea gardens have been tidied up extraordinarily neatly. The flat rice paddies are covered with golden, ripe early rice. Groups of male and female commune members are laughing and busy harvesting, plowing, and transplanting late rice. Everyone is strong and energetic. The commune members told me that because schistosomiasis has been eliminated and the labor force has become stronger, since last year, they have changed most of the single-season rice fields to double-season rice. This year, more fertilizer has been accumulated, and early rice has been densely planted. A mu of field yields about three or four hundred catties of rice, and the highest yield is more than seven hundred catties, which is a bumper harvest that has not been seen in decades! I found Hong Tiansheng, the son of He Gui'e, who was the first to be cured of schistosomiasis. He was plowing the field, tall and strong, with thick arms and a round waist, and he held the plow with ease. I asked him how his family's life was. He said that he is now a very strong labor force in the commune, and he can work about 300 labor days a year. Adding his sister's labor days, the income from grain and cash is more than enough to eat and use, and life is very good. At this time, old commune member Hong Jinzhao couldn't help but come over and said that he originally had three sons. Before liberation, two sons were conscripted into the Kuomintang army with illness and died outside. He and a young son were now saved by the Communist Party. His son got married the year before last, and had a fat baby last year.

Speaking of having babies, many women can be seen in each village holding newborn babies who are one or two years old. In Yanxia Village, no children were born in the twelve years after 1943; since 1956, more than a dozen households have added nine new children. Hong Hehua of Shiling Village was married at the age of eighteen and did not have children until she was twenty-eight. After being cured of schistosomiasis, she gave birth to her first child last year.

I also visited the first place here to be named "New Village," which is Xiaoyanqian Village, which was destroyed by schistosomiasis thirty years ago. Now, a remote farming team of 25 people dispatched by the Licun Agricultural Cooperative lives there. They have initially repaired the collapsed houses and planted various fruit trees and bamboo forests around them.

All this shows that this place is recovering its long-lost youth, and people are embarking on a happy and prosperous life. But people can never forget where the new life came from. Now, a folk song circulating here expresses everyone's feelings: The Communist Party is the savior, Chairman Mao is our father and mother, Pull out the roots of disease and eliminate the roots of bitterness, Enjoy a happy life for ten thousand years.

    奇迹只能出在今天
    ——江西婺源县是怎样根除血吸虫病的
    本报记者　钟明
    多少年来，血吸虫病折磨着婺源县的人民。但是，在旧社会，人们只有忍受着无尽头的痛苦和死亡。今天，在共产党的领导下，这里已经根除了血吸虫病。
    这里是一个狭长的山谷地带，东西约二十华里长的范围，包括现存的董家、路下、长林、岩下、石岭、小岩前、横亭等自然村庄。相传未发生血吸虫病之前，这里是人丁兴旺，收成相当好。血吸虫病究竟从什么时候开始，已无可查考。据县志载：清光绪年间曾“突然发生‘蛊病’（即血吸虫病），民多负病不务生产，年有死亡。”但封建统治阶级把原因归到农民开石灰山伤了“龙脉”，以致“地脉焦枯，深受其害”，因此便“一面严加惩治，一面给示加禁”，使农民更苦上加苦。后来国民党反动政府除了抓兵、要钱、要粮以外，对人民的疾苦漠不关心。于是，感染血吸虫病的人越来越多，终于在1930年前又发生了一次急性流行。据活着的老人们记忆，当时每天都要死十几个人，不及一年，各有百多户人家的土桥头、李家、金家井、冷水山等五个村子便全部复灭了。现在，尚存的七个村子剩下的人总共也只几十个，而且大部分是不下田的妇女，也都感染着不同程度的血吸虫病。解放时，这里连同外来的男人，要来的小孩总人口不过一百一十一户三百四十七人，个个面黄肌瘦，又矮又小，背驼肚胀。因为劳动力缺乏，田地荒芜，长满了野草杂树，房倒椽摧，到处是残垣断壁，农民广种薄收，糠菜度日，凄苦之状，使人不忍目视。那时刚刚解放，各方面的医务条件还不具备，为了帮助人民恢复生产，政府经常从附近地区抽调劳动力给予支援。
    1955年11月党中央和毛主席发出了消灭血吸虫病的号召。由县委书记和县长亲自领导的血吸虫病防治组织宣布成立，并于1956年初派出了由七个专门医务人员组成的血吸虫病防治小组到了这里开展防治工作。开始，人们满以为给群众治病一定会很顺利的，岂知这对于久受痛苦折磨已经接受了命运支配的人，还有多少困难和阻碍！向群众讲解血吸虫病是怎样来的，说钉螺身上寄生着尾蚴，人碰到它会钻进人体，再到血管里变成毛蚴害人，……竟没一个人相信。人们说：“我们没见过钉螺上有什么尾蚴头蚴的，除非钉螺能钻进人肚里！”有的干脆说：“你们算了吧，这里风水不好，你们治不了我们的病！”再要讲，听的人都不听了。但是，防治小组并没有被困难吓退。经过研究，他们把粪便、虫卵和活的钉螺、尾蚴放在显微镜下送给群众看，用事实说服群众，这时人们才大吃一惊：“原来就是这些小毛虫钻到肚子里去了！”历年来迷信“龙脉”“风水”和“命运”的思想动摇了，许多人开始按照医生的嘱咐送粪便来检查，经过检查，这里的三百四十七人，除外地到来时间较短的人以外，二百零八人患有血吸虫病。
    第一关突破了，多少年的病能治好吗？人们又怀疑了。注射锑剂叫谁打针谁都不肯，一再动员，石岭村何桂娥老太太决定把自己的一个儿子和女儿送去试试看。出于她的意料之外，才一个多月，不但腹水全消失了，原来二十五岁的儿子长得像十一、二岁的孩子一样，又瘦又小，连一桶水都提不起，这时开始发育了，体重显著增加。二十一岁的女儿原来一直不来月经，这时也有了月经。村里人都知道了，何老太太心里更是高兴，逢人便说：“医生比神仙还灵。”一下子就轰动了整个山谷，要求治疗的人都自动找上门来。病人要连续治疗，医生们白天工作一天，晚上还常常彻夜不眠。生活困难的病人在治疗期间，国家还发给救济费。县委书记、县长、卫生局长经常来检查督促工作，慰问病人。人们都被感动得流下泪来。
    消灭血吸虫病还必须使治疗与消灭钉螺、粪便管理、水源管理等综合预防措施结合起来，这时也能得到群众大力支持了。在医务人员的指导下，男女老少一齐出动，像围剿敌人一样进行火烧灭螺、药剂杀螺和石灰杀螺，过去多年不烧了的石灰窑又大量烧起石灰来了。田里、草里以至石头缝里，只要发现钉螺，人们一个都不肯放过。另外，填平旧沟，开挖新沟，用连接起来的竹管从山上引泉水下山，在各村建立贮水池和洗衣、洗菜的用水池，保持水源清洁。在粪便管理上，开始建立小型公共厕所或集中粪缸，将粪便交专人管理，定期密封贮存，杀灭虫卵而后做肥料。逐渐使人人养成了讲卫生、爱清洁的习惯。
    一年又一年的苦战，一个接一个的病人恢复了健康，这里的面貌也随着改观了。到今年4月25日，经过江西省和上饶专署血吸虫病防治工作领导小组的复查鉴定，证明这里已经完全根除了血吸虫病。
    仅仅两年多的时间，就使这里人民永远摆脱了贫弱和死亡。这里过去荒芜的土地已经全部垦复了，山坡旱地上到处种着芝麻、大豆和高大的玉米，青葱的茶园被收拾得格外整齐，平坦的田垅里铺满了金黄的成熟了的早稻，成群成伙的男女社员们正欢笑着忙于收割、犁田和栽插晚稻，个个身强力壮，干劲十足。社员们告诉我说，由于消灭了血吸虫病，劳动力强了，从去年起，他们就把大部分一季稻田改种了双季稻，今年肥料积得多，早稻又实行了密植，一亩田打的谷子在三、四百斤左右，最高的有七百多斤，是几十年来没有见过的丰收了！我找到第一个治好血吸虫病的何桂娥的儿子洪天生，他正在犁田，长得又高又大，膀粗腰圆，扶起犁来轻松自如。我问他家里生活怎样。他说，他现在已经是社里很强的劳动力了，一年能作三百来个劳动日，加上他妹妹的劳动日，收入的粮食和现款吃用不完，生活过得顶好。这时老社员洪进兆也忍不住走过来说话了，他说，自己原来有三个儿子，解放前两个儿子带病被国民党抓壮丁死在外边了，剩下他和一个小儿子现在叫共产党救活了，儿子前年娶了亲，去年有了个胖娃娃。
    说起生娃娃来，在每个村子里都可以看到许多妇女怀里抱着一两岁的新生婴儿。岩下村1943年以后的十二年中，没人生一个孩子；1956年开始，十多户人家已经新添了九个孩子。石岭村洪荷花十八岁结婚到二十八岁都不生育，医好了血吸虫病后，去年就生了第一胎。
    我还参观了这里第一个被命名为“新村”的地方，这就是三十年前被血吸虫病毁灭的小岩前村。现在，由里村农业社派来的二十五人的远耕队住着，他们已将倒塌的房屋初步进行了整修，并在周围栽种了各种果树和竹林。
    这一切，都显示着这里正在恢复着它早已逝去的青春，人们正在走上幸福康乐的生活。但人们永远不能忘记新的生活是从哪里来的。现在，这里流传的一首歌谣表达了每个人的心情：共产党是救星，毛主席是爹娘，拔掉病根除苦根，幸福生活万年享。
