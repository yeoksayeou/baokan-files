The following is a compilation of reports from Western newspapers concerning the intensifying economic plunder of Latin American countries by U.S. imperialism. In order to achieve its goals of plunder, U.S. imperialism has employed various despicable and shameless methods, causing severe economic difficulties for Latin American countries.

　　High Profits from Small Investments
　　Argentina

　　Taking advantage of Argentina's economic difficulties, U.S. oil monopoly capital recently lured the Argentine government into allowing foreign capital to develop and produce Argentina's oil. According to a statement on the oil issue by Argentine President Frondizi, the Argentine National Petroleum Corporation has signed contracts or priority agreements totaling $917.5 million with foreign oil groups to "develop" Argentina's oil industry. Except for a Belgian "Petroleum Stock Company" which will invest approximately $35 million, all the investments come from U.S. oil monopoly groups. In the contracts signed, U.S. monopoly capital groups are, as usual, implementing the principle of "small investment, large returns." For example, Pan American International Oil Company (belonging to Indiana Standard Oil) will invest $60 million in an area of 1,540 square miles. However, the contract stipulates that for every cubic meter of oil produced in this area within the first five years, Argentina must pay Pan American $10. After five years, the payment will be gradually adjusted according to the then-current world oil prices. In other words, Argentina has to buy its own oil from the U.S. oil company at market prices.

　　Creating Difficulties
　　Brazil

　　The U.S. is exploiting Brazil's sluggish oil production to pressure Brazil to follow Argentina's example and open up oil exploitation rights to U.S. oil groups. According to "The New York Times," during Dulles's visit to Brazil, the Brazilian government hoped that the U.S. would provide economic support to the state-run Petrobras. However, Dulles rejected this request on the grounds that the U.S. does not support any state-run enterprises. While reporting that Brazil's trade deficit for 1958 would reach $500 million due to massive oil imports, "The New York Times" insidiously wrote that, "Sooner or later, Brazil must face the reality that its brave attempt to 'go it alone' in the oil industry for the past five years has been insufficient to escape massive oil imports." The newspaper also advocated that Petrobras should "unite" with foreign capital like Argentina.

　　Since its establishment five years ago, Petrobras's production has been poor, only able to produce one-fifth of the country's oil needs. Recently, "Time" magazine, a mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital, inadvertently revealed that one of the reasons for this situation is that the U.S. "experts" deliberately dragged their feet. According to the magazine, the person who has been in full charge of the exploration work at Petrobras since 1955 is Link, an American "expert" hired from New Jersey Standard Oil. He is paid $100,000 annually, has a large team of exploration personnel, wasted three years of time, and has not built a single economically viable oil well. "Time" magazine also used this to imply to Brazil that it should follow Argentina's example and allow foreign capital to exploit Brazil's oil.

　　Selling Dear, Buying Cheap
　　Uruguay

　　An article recently published in the Uruguayan "People's Paper" said that the unequal trade policy of "selling dear and buying cheap" implemented by the U.S. is the cause of Uruguay's foreign trade crisis. This U.S. policy has led to lower prices and reduced total exports of Uruguay's exports, while the prices of imported industrial products and fuels continue to rise. The newspaper said that this is a "pair of scissors" cutting off the "throat" of Uruguay's national economy.

　　Uruguay mainly relies on exporting agricultural products such as wool, leather, and meat to earn foreign exchange, with wool exports accounting for about 51% of total exports. All fuel and most raw materials for industrial use rely on imports.

　　The "People's Paper" cited materials published by the Bank of Uruguay, stating that from 1951 to 1957, the prices of Uruguay's main exports fell sharply. Frozen meat fell by 9.38%, canned goods by 12.26%, wool by 45.68%, leather by 56.16%, wheat by 20.40%, and cellulose by 45.91%. During the same period, the prices of imports continued to rise, with crude oil rising by 16.28%, coal by 13.30%, tractors by 17.95%, and tobacco by 16.28%. The newspaper said that there is only one conclusion: it is necessary to change Uruguay's foreign trade policy and orient it towards the socialist market, because in the socialist market, the exchange relationship is completely opposite to the current unequal trade relationship between Uruguay and the U.S.

　　Excluding Exports
　　Peru

　　The U.S. policy of excluding Peruvian exports is causing Peru to experience serious economic difficulties, with a particularly tight foreign exchange situation. Due to inflation and the continuous increase in the national budget deficit, the purchasing power of the sol (Peru's currency) has plummeted. The U.S. government has already begun to push Peruvian cotton out of its traditional markets. As a result, Chile, the main importer of Peruvian cotton, purchased approximately 25% less Peruvian cotton in 1957 than in 1956.

　　The U.S. Congress recently intends to raise import taxes on metals, and even intends to stop importing metals altogether, which makes Peru's economic prospects even gloomier. Peru has already sent a note to the U.S. expressing its "deep concern."

　　Depressing Prices
　　Mexico

　　The Bank of Mexico recently revealed that Mexico's trade deficit for the first five months of 1958 was $83.403 million, compared to a deficit of $49.4 million for the same period in 1957.

　　The bank said that imports during this period increased by $41.6 million compared to 1957, while exports increased by only $20.8 million.

　　The reason for the sharp increase in Mexico's trade deficit is that, in order to alleviate its own economic crisis, the U.S. has reduced imports from Mexico and depressed the prices of imported goods, especially the prices of non-ferrous metals such as lead, zinc, and copper. The U.S. has always been the main buyer of Mexican products, with 80% of Mexico's exports going to the U.S.

### 美国掠夺“后院”不择手段  拉丁美洲经济受害匪浅

　　美国掠夺“后院”不择手段
　　拉丁美洲经济受害匪浅
    本报综合报道　根据西方报刊消息，美帝国主义对拉丁美洲各国的经济掠夺又有进一步的发展。为了达到掠夺目的，美帝国主义施用了各种卑鄙无耻的手段，造成了拉丁美洲各国严重的经济困难。
    一本万利
　　阿根廷
    美国石油垄断资本最近趁阿根廷的经济困难，引诱阿根廷政府允许外资开发和生产阿根廷的石油。根据阿根廷总统弗朗迪西发表的关于石油问题的文告，阿根廷石油矿藏管理局已和外国石油集团签订了共计九亿一千七百五十万美元的合同或优先契约以“发展”阿根廷的石油工业。其中除了一家比利时的“石油股份公司”将投资约三千五百万美元之外，全部是美国石油垄断集团的投资。在所签订的合同中，美国垄断资本集团照例地实行着“投资少而拿走多”的原则。譬如，泛美国际石油公司（属于印第安那美孚油公司）将在广达一千五百四十平方英里的地区中投资六千万美元，但是，合同规定，头五年内，在这地区每生产一立方公尺的石油，阿根廷就要支付给泛美公司十美元，五年以后，还要逐渐调整到按照当时的石油世界价格支付，也就是说，阿根廷要照价向美国石油公司购买本来是属于阿根廷自己的石油。
    制造困难
　　巴西
    美国正利用巴西石油生产不振的状况，企图压迫巴西按照阿根廷的榜样把石油开采权开放给美国石油集团。据“纽约时报”报道，在杜勒斯访问巴西时，巴西政府曾希望美国在经济上支援巴西国营的巴西石油公司，但杜勒斯已以美国不支持任何国营企业为理由而予以拒绝。“纽约时报”在报道巴西由于大量进口石油而致1958年的贸易赤字将达五亿美元时，用心险恶地写到：“巴西迟早必须面对现实，它过去五年间在石油工业上‘单干’的勇敢尝试已不足摆脱石油的大量进口了”。该报并鼓吹巴西石油公司应该像阿根廷一样同外国资本“联合起来”。
    巴西石油公司自成立五年以来，生产情况一直不好，只能生产本国所需石油用量的五分之一。最近美国垄断资本的喉舌“时代”周刊，无意中泄露了造成这种情况的原因之一是美国“专家”故意磨洋工。根据这家杂志的报道，从1955年起就在巴西石油公司全权掌握开采工作的，是一位从新泽西美孚油公司请来的美国“专家”林克。他每年支薪十万美元，弄了一大批勘探人员，浪费了三年的时间，连一个在经济上值得开采的油井也没有建成。“时代”周刊还借此暗示巴西，应该效法阿根廷那样地让外国资本来开采巴西的石油。
    贵卖贱买
    乌拉圭
    乌拉圭“人民报”在最近发表的一篇文章说，美国所执行的“贵卖贱买”的不平等贸易政策是造成乌拉圭对外贸易危机的原因。美国这种政策使得乌拉圭的出口货价格降低和出口总额减少，而进口的工业品和燃料的价格却不断上升。这家报纸说，这是一把割断乌拉圭民族经济“喉咙”的“剪刀”。
    乌拉圭主要靠出口羊毛、皮革、肉类等农产品换取外汇，其中羊毛出口占出口总值的51％左右。而工业用的全部燃料和大部原料都依赖进口。
    “人民报”引用乌拉圭银行公布的材料说，从1951年到1957年这一期间，乌拉圭的主要出口品的价格大大下跌，其中冻肉下跌9.38％，罐头12.26％，羊毛45.68％，皮革56.16％，小麦20.40％，纤维素45.91％。而在同一时期，进口货的价格不断上涨，其中石油原油上涨16.28％，煤炭13.30％，拖拉机17.95％，烟草16.28％。报纸说，结论只有一个：必须改变乌拉圭对外贸易的方针，使它面向社会主义市场，因为在社会主义市场上，交换的关系和现在乌美之间的不平等贸易关系是完全相反的。
    排挤出口
　　秘鲁
    美国对秘鲁出口商品的排挤政策，使秘鲁正在经历着严重的经济困难，外汇情况特别紧张。由于通货膨胀和国家预算赤字的不断增加，索尔（秘鲁的货币）的购买力急剧下降。美国政府已经开始把秘鲁的棉花从它的传统市场上排挤出去。这样的结果，秘鲁棉花的主要进口国智利，1957年收购秘鲁的棉花比1956年减少了大约25％。
    美国国会最近又打算提高金属进口税，甚至打算停止金属进口，这使秘鲁的经济前景更加黯淡。秘鲁为此已照会美国，表示“深感不安”。
    压低价格
　　墨西哥
    墨西哥银行最近透露，1958年头五个月，墨西哥的贸易赤字为八千三百四十万三千美元，而1957年同一期间的赤字为四千九百四十万美元。
    这家银行说，这个期间的输入比1957年增加了四千一百六十万美元，而输出只增加了二千零八十万美元。
    造成墨西哥贸易赤字激增的原因是：美国为缓和自己的经济危机，减少了从墨西哥的进口，并压低进口货价格，尤其是铅、锌、铜等有色金属的价格。而美国一向是墨西哥产品的主要买主，墨西哥出口的80％是输往美国的。
