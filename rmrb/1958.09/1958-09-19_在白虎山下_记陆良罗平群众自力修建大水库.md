Under White Tiger Mountain
——A Record of the People of Luliang and Luoping Self-Reliantly Building a Large Reservoir
By Our Correspondent Chen Yongjin

The Shezhang River, which flows down from the mountains northwest of Luliang, is cut off at White Tiger Mountain to form a lake. This is the Dumushan Reservoir, a large reservoir rarely seen in the country, built by the people of Luliang and Luoping counties themselves. This reservoir project is quite large, with a planned water storage capacity of 100 million cubic meters. The large dam is 34 meters high, higher than the Ming Tombs Reservoir in Beijing, and is now more than 20 meters high.

Regarding water, the people here both hate it and love it. The climate here allows for crops to be grown in all four seasons, but without rain in winter and spring, crops cannot be planted. Not to mention planting crops, even drinking water has to be carried from several or even more than ten miles away. During summer and autumn, people often fight drought in the morning and prevent floods in the evening. Before the cooperatives, the people here said that socialism could be implemented elsewhere, but not here. Only with water could they have a good life. At that time, the Luliang County Party Committee also wanted to build a reservoir on the Shezhang River, but after the relevant departments conducted a survey, they said: This is a matter for the second Five-Year Plan.

After the upsurge of socialist production began, the people here could no longer hold back. The masses said: If large reservoirs can be built elsewhere, why can't we build large reservoirs here! If we wait a few years to build, how can we complete the forty-article program proposed by the Party Central Committee!

In early February, the Luliang County Party Committee and the Luoping County Party Committee jointly decided to immediately start construction of the Dumushan Reservoir in Dumucun, and to strive to complete it this year. As soon as construction started, White Tiger Mountain was covered in heavy snow. But no matter how much it snowed, no matter how slippery the roads were, no matter how cold the weather was, no matter how dangerous White Tiger Mountain was, people still worked day and night. Their clothes were soaked by the snow, they dried them with their own body heat, and if they fell, they got up again. The sand used to pour cement had to be transported from Liaohu, sixty miles away. In order to transport the sand and soil, they organized a pack train of more than 600 horses to transport it non-stop. There were only a few ordinary technicians on such a large reservoir construction site. They did not use engineers to overcome difficulties, but used the method of concentrating the wisdom of the masses to overcome difficulties. Building large reinforced concrete drainage ditches required cement mixing. Although they had never seen cement or reinforcing bars, they learned this work in a very short time. In the long tunnel, a strong smell of gunpowder permeated. People working inside could only persist for half an hour at first. According to general principles, the power of the blower can only work within a distance of sixty meters, but they adopted the result of shortening the distance of the skin tube, which increased the work efficiency by more than one time. For the lingering smoke and dust, they used a watering method to quickly eliminate the gun smoke. Now, people can work inside for several hours without any danger.

Now, the tunnel, more than 200 meters long, is about to be opened, and the dam is about to be completed. From now on, the farmers here will control the Shezhang River and make it benefit the people in the mountainous areas. (The left picture is Dumushan Reservoir, photo by Wang Weiguo)

    在白虎山下
    ——记陆良罗平群众自力修建大水库
    本报记者　陈勇进
    从陆良西北丛山间奔流下来的蛇长河，在白虎山下被拦腰截断形成一个湖泊。这就是全国少见的由陆良、罗平两县群众自己修建的大型水库——杜木水库。这个水库工程颇为浩大，计划蓄水一亿方，大水坝高三十四公尺，高过北京十三陵水库，现在已经筑了二十多公尺。
    对于水，这里的群众又是恨它又是喜它。这里的气候可以四季种庄稼，但冬天春天没有雨，庄稼种不成，别说种庄稼，吃水还要跑到几里到十几里以外去挑。夏秋间，又往往是早上抗旱，黄昏防洪。合作化前，这里的人们说，别处能实行社会主义，这里没法实行社会主义，只有有了水才能过好时光。那时候，陆良县委也想在蛇长河上修个水库，但有关的部门在进行了勘查之后说：这是第二个五年计划的事情。
    社会主义的生产高潮开始后，这里的人民再也沉不住气了。群众说：别处能修大水库，咱们这里就不能修大水库！等几年修，我们怎样完成党中央提出的四十条纲要啊！
    二月初，陆良县委和罗平县委一起决定立即动工在杜木村修建杜木水库，并要争取在今年完成。刚开工，白虎山就飘起了茫茫的大雪。但不管雪怎么下，不管路怎么滑，不管天气怎么冷，不管白虎山怎么险，人们仍然日日夜夜地工作。衣服被雪打湿了，自己暖干，跌倒了再爬起来。浇灌水泥用的沙子，要到六十里路以外的潦浒去运。为了运沙土，他们组织了六百多匹的马帮不停息地运。这样大的水库工地上只有几个普通的技术员，他们不是用工程师来克服困难而是用集中群众智慧的方法来克服困难。修建钢筋水泥的大排水沟要进行水泥搅拌，虽然他们没见过水泥、钢筋，但在很短的时间里也学会这种活了。在漫长的隧道里，弥漫浓重的火药气味，在里面工作的人最初只能坚持半个小时。按照一般的道理，鼓风机的力量只能在六十公尺的距离之内起作用，而他们采用缩短皮管距离的结果，使工作效率提高到一倍多。对于那经久不散的烟尘，他们用洒水的办法，使炮烟迅速地消掉了。现在，人们在里面工作几个钟头也没什么危险。
    现在，长二百多公尺的隧道就要凿通了，水坝也就要完工了。这里的农民从此就要把蛇长河控制起来，使它给山区人民造福。（左图是杜木水库　王伟国摄）
