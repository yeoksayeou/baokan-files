Editorial Afterword:

　　Go to the Masses
    The comprehensive large-scale collection of folk songs and local operas being carried out in Sichuan Province is an effective method of following the mass line.
    People's thinking often lags behind objective practice. In the current great leap forward in various undertakings, this situation is even more prominent. The various miracles created by the masses in the Great Leap Forward cannot be read in books and cannot be imagined in offices and laboratories. To change this backward state, the only way is to go to the masses, learn from the masses honestly, enrich one's knowledge in the practice of the masses, and use one's own theory to help the masses summarize and improve various inventions and practical experiences. Then, take this more systematic and higher knowledge to guide the actions of the masses. In this way, all our work will have a deeper mass base. The comprehensive large-scale collection of folk songs and local operas carried out in Sichuan Province has given us new inspiration in this regard. When our experts and staff in various fields go deep into the masses and summarize the inventions and advanced experiences of the masses in all aspects, and use the creations and experiences of the masses to enrich our experience, this will not only make the knowledge and experience of the masses more systematic and improved, but will also inevitably promote the extraordinary prosperity and flourishing of various undertakings.

　　到群众中去
    四川省正在开展的全面大采风，是走群众路线的一种有效办法。
    人们的思想，往往落后于客观实践。在当前各项事业大跃进中，这个情况显得更加突出。群众在大跃进中创造的各种奇迹，是在书本中读不到，在办公室和实验室里根本无法想像的。要改变这种落后状态，唯一的办法是到群众中去，老老实实地向群众学习，让自己的知识在群众的实践中得到丰富，用自己的理论帮助群众把各种创造发明和实践经验总结和提高起来，然后把这种更加系统的更高的知识，拿来指导群众的行动。这样，我们的一切工作就有了更加深厚的群众基础。四川省开展的全面大采风，正是在这方面给了我们新的启示。当我们各方面的专家和工作人员都深入群众，把群众在一切方面的创造发明和先进经验总结起来，用群众的创造和经验丰富我们的经验，这不仅会使群众的知识和经验更加系统和提高，也必然会促进各项事业分外繁荣和兴盛。
