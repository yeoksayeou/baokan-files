    Everyone Participate in Developing Atomic Energy Science
    The early transfer of China's first experimental atomic pile and cyclotron to production marks another victory for our Party in leading scientific endeavors. As everyone knows, atomic energy is a cutting-edge science of our time, requiring a high level of scientific and technological expertise to master and utilize it practically. Now that our atomic pile and accelerator have been transferred to production, it indicates that we have opened the door to this cutting-edge science, and have taken the first step, entering the vast field of atomic energy science. Although this is just a beginning, the beginning is very important. With a good start, there is a great prospect for development.
    The research and development of atomic energy science are closely related to the current material production base. Because the ultimate goal of any scientific research is for practical application, to engage in material production more, faster, better, and more economically, thereby benefiting mankind. To master and utilize any cutting-edge science and technology, there must be a corresponding material foundation. It is impossible to imagine that in a country with extremely low levels of industrial and agricultural production and scientific and technological expertise, atomic energy can be researched and utilized on a large scale. It can be said that without a foundation, there is no cutting edge. The rapid development of China's industrial and agricultural production and the rapid improvement of scientific and technological levels have opened up broad prospects for China's atomic energy science. This is the foundation for the rapid development of China's atomic energy science.
    The current situation and conditions are very good for the research and utilization of atomic energy. However, good situations and good conditions will not automatically produce good results. Whether atomic energy science can develop relatively quickly depends on what policies we adopt.
    One approach is: because atomic energy is a cutting-edge science, it can only be handled by the central scientific research departments. Because it is cutting-edge, of course, only a few authorities should be invited to participate in the research, and unknown individuals should not be allowed to enter the atomic energy field. Because it is cutting-edge, of course, all methods must adopt foreign approaches. If this approach is adopted, it is certain that the situation will be deserted. Even if atomic energy science develops in a few years, its speed will inevitably be very slow.
    There is another approach, which is for everyone to participate in developing atomic energy science. Adopting this approach will enable the rapid development of atomic energy science. Some people may shake their heads and say that this is impossible. Atomic energy science and technology are extremely complex, how can everyone participate? In fact, all science is the result of human understanding of nature. Before people recognize it, it is infinitely mysterious. Once people recognize it, the mystery is revealed. Before the use of electricity, people used oil lamps and candles for lighting. No one dreamed that pressing a switch would bring light. At that time, people had a fear of lightning in the sky, but now electricity has become a common sense. In this year's Great Leap Forward, in just a few months, tens of thousands of small hydropower stations have been built in rural China. In the struggle between man and nature, it is man, not nature, that plays a decisive role. Many facts since the Great Leap Forward have proved that the peak of science and technology is not out of reach. As long as we are determined, experts, young scientific and technical personnel, technicians, and the broad masses are mobilized together, and everyone participates in developing atomic energy science, atomic energy science will develop vigorously.
    The key issue is still to follow the mass line. The mass line is the Party's fundamental line for leading all work. Atomic energy, this cutting-edge science, is no exception. The research and utilization of atomic energy science must also implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, and implement the policy of combining central and local authorities, combining large, medium, and small scales, and combining foreign and indigenous methods. Current practice has proven that this can be done. Now it is not only the central scientific departments that are researching atomic energy. Party and government leadership organs in various provinces and cities are also very enthusiastic about developing atomic energy science and technology. Several cities, schools, and scientific research institutions have relied on their own strength to conduct atomic energy scientific research and have achieved results. Facts have proved that atomic energy science is by no means only handled by a few people in the central science departments, nor does it take a long time to develop. It can be done on a relatively large scale, mobilizing more people to participate, and completing it in a relatively short period of time. Our goal is to peacefully utilize atomic energy to benefit the people, so the people will definitely actively participate in the work of developing atomic energy science. As long as everyone starts working on it, things will be done quickly and well.
    The great Soviet Union has provided great assistance in the construction of China's first experimental atomic reactor and cyclotron. In China's emerging cutting-edge science sector, the light of the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples also shines. The Soviet Union is a country with a highly developed atomic energy science. We must continue to learn from the Soviet Union in the future.
    In the world of atomic energy, we now only occupy a very small corner. To make atomic energy widely used in China's construction cause, we still need to make extremely great efforts. However, since we are determined to climb to the peak of world science and technology, there are no difficulties that can stop us from moving forward. As long as we continue to break superstitions, liberate our thinking, and as long as we work hard, practically, and diligently, atomic energy science will definitely develop at a high speed in a not-too-long period of time.

### 大家来办原子能科学

    大家来办原子能科学
    我国第一座实验性原子堆和回旋加速器的提前移交生产，标志着我们的党在领导科学事业中取得了又一次胜利。谁都知道，原子能是当代的一门尖端科学，需要有高度的科学技术水平才能掌握它和实际利用它。现在我们的原子堆和加速器移交生产了，这表示我们已打开了这门尖端科学的大门，而且已经跨出了第一步，进入了广阔的原子能科学的领域，这虽然只是一个开端，但开端是很重要的，有了良好的开端，就有了远大的发展前途。
    原子能科学的研究和发展同当前物质生产基础关系很大。因为任何一种科学研究，它的终极目的都是为了实际利用，都是为了更多更快更好更省地从事于物质生产，从而造福于人类。任何一门尖端的科学技术，要想掌握它利用它，必须要有相适应的物质基础，不可能设想在一个工农业生产和科学技术水平极度低下的国家里，能够大规模研究和利用原子能。可以这样说，没有基础，也就没有尖端。我国工农业生产的飞跃发展和科学技术水平的迅速提高，给我国原子能科学开辟了远大前程。这是我国的原子能科学会很快地有很大发展的基础。
    对研究和利用原子能来说，当前形势和条件都是很好的。然而好的形势和好的条件并不会自动地产生好的效果。原子能科学能不能比较迅速地发展，还要看我们采取什么样的方针。
    一种方针是：因为原子能是一门尖端科学，所以只能由中央的科学研究部门来办，因为是尖端，当然只能聘请少数权威参加研究，无名之士一概不得入原子之门。因为是尖端，当然一切方法都必须采取洋办法。如果采取这个方针，可以肯定，局面一定是冷冷清清的，若干年内原子能科学纵有发展，其速度也必然很慢。
    还有另外一种方针，这就是大家来办原子能科学。采取这个方针，原子能科学事业就能很快发展。也许有人会摇摇头说，这是办不到的，原子能科学技术极其复杂，怎么能大家来办呢？其实一切科学，都是人对自然认识的结果。在人没有认识它以前，那是玄妙无比的，一旦被人认识以后，奥妙就被揭穿了。在电能利用以前，人们用油灯和蜡烛来照明，谁做梦也没有想到一按开关就会送来光明。那时人们对空中的闪电存在着一种惧怕心理，而现在电已成为一种普通的常识了。在今年的大跃进中，短短的几个月，在我国农村就办起了几万座小型水电站。在人和自然的斗争中起决定性作用的是人而不是自然。大跃进以来许多事实证明：科学技术的高峰并不是高不可攀的，只要我们下定决心，专家、青年科学技术人员、技术工人和广大群众一齐发动，大家来办原子能科学，原子能科学就会蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。
    关键的问题仍然在于走群众路线。群众路线是党领导各项工作的根本路线，原子能这一尖端科学也不能例外，原子能科学的研究和利用工作也必须贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，实行中央和地方并举，大、中、小相结合、洋土结合的方针。当前的实际已经证明这是可以办到的，现在已不只是中央的科学部门在研究原子能，各省市的党政领导机关对发展原子能科学技术也都很热心，若干城市、学校、科学研究机关已经依靠自己的力量进行原子能的科学研究，并且获得了成果。事实证明：原子能科学绝不是只能由中央科学部门的少数人来办，也绝不是需要很长的时间才可以办起来，完全可以在比较广大的范围内，发动更多的人来办，和在比较短的时间内办起来。我们的目的是和平利用原子能，为人民谋福利，因此人民群众一定会积极参加办原子能科学的工作。只要大家动手来办，事情就会办得又快又好。
  伟大的苏联，对于我国的第一座实验性原子反应堆和回旋加速器的建设，给予了很大的帮助。在我国这门新兴的尖端科学部门中，也闪烁着中苏人民伟大友谊的光辉。苏联是原子能科学高度发达的国家，我们今后还必须继续向苏联学习。
    在原子能的世界中，现在我们只是占有了一个极小的角落，要使原子能在我国的建设事业中得到普遍利用，还需要付出极其巨大的努力。然而，我们既然决心要攀上世界科学技术的高峰，就没有什么困难可以阻挡我们前进。只要我们继续破除迷信、解放思想，只要我们艰苦、踏实、努力工作，原子能科学就一定会在一个不长的时间内高速度地发展起来。
