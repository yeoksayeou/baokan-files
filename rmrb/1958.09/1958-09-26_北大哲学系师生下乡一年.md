    The entire faculty and students of the Philosophy Department of Peking University were sent to Lucheng Township in the Daxing District of Beijing suburbs at the end of last month, where they will labor and study for a year. During this year, they will live, eat, and labor with the peasants, spending two-thirds of their time participating in productive labor and one-third of their time studying. Their task is to integrate participation in labor, ideological transformation, and teaching. All teachers and students have expressed their determination to be in the countryside, have their hearts in the countryside, be red in the countryside, and be specialized in the countryside; to take the commune as their home and the commune as their school. They assured the Party that they would learn and use philosophy in actual struggle, write a philosophy textbook on the history of the cooperative and for the peasants within a year, help cadres summarize experiences, help peasants learn theory, and cultivate themselves into ordinary laborers with socialist consciousness and culture in actual struggle.

    北大哲学系师生下乡一年
    北京大学哲学系哲学专业全体师生于上月底下放到北京郊区大兴区芦城乡，在那里劳动和学习一年。在这一年的时间里，他们将和农民一起同吃同住同劳动，用三分之二的时间参加生产劳动；用三分之一的时间进行学习，他们的任务是要把参加劳动、改造思想、进行教学三位一体地结合起来。全系师生纷纷表示要作到人在农村，心在农村，红在农村，专在农村；以社为家，以社为校。他们向党保证，要在实际斗争中学习和使用哲学，要在一年内写出合作社历史与农民的哲学课本，帮助干部总结经验，帮助农民学习理论，要在实际斗争中把自己培养成为有社会主义觉悟有文化的普通劳动者。
