How to Consolidate People's Communes?
Henan Adopts Five Measures: Strengthening Communist Education; Vigorously Developing Industrial and Agricultural Production; Correctly Resolving System Issues; Conscientiously Doing Autumn Distribution Work; Running Public Canteens Well

(This News) According to our newspaper, the Rural Work Department of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a meeting of rural work directors from prefectures (cities) and counties from August 26 to September 7. The meeting proposed the combat mission of consolidating and improving people's communes at the present time: "Secretaries take the lead, the whole party and the whole people mobilize, and the People's Communes should be well-managed from the aspects of political ideology, distribution, life, management system, and organizational construction, so as to promote the overall great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production."

The meeting believed that the people's commune movement in Henan Province fully conformed to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's resolution on the establishment of people's communes in rural areas and Chairman Mao's instructions. Therefore, the people's commune movement was healthy. After the establishment of people's communes in various places, many commune members voluntarily handed over their private plots, patches of woodland, large agricultural tools, as well as pigs and sheep, etc., to the commune, further eliminating the remnants of private ownership of the means of production and creating good conditions for the transition to a communist society. Due to the change in production relations, people's ideological leap forward has been further promoted, and a new communist ethos of "one for all, all for one" has emerged everywhere. With the realization of the people's communes, not only has the overall development of industrial and agricultural production been greatly promoted, but the face of rural society has also been greatly changed.

The meeting pointed out that the current task is how to consolidate and improve the people's communes. The meeting believed that: we should closely combine the large-scale iron and steel production with the autumn harvest and planting, and conduct a universal consolidation and improvement of the people's communes, so as to give full play to the superiority of the people's communes and promote greater development of various socialist construction undertakings. At present, five tasks should be focused on.

I. Conduct socialist and communist education for all commune members. Continuing to strengthen political and ideological work and implementing the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's instruction on "launching a socialist and communist education movement in rural areas this winter and next spring" is the key to improving and consolidating the people's communes. The content of this work is, first of all, to further raise the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants by summarizing the experience of the unprecedented bumper harvests in agriculture in summer and autumn and discussing the commune charter. Secondly, continue to publicize and implement the policy of democratic commune management and "running the commune diligently and frugally," and correctly handle the relationship between accumulation and distribution under the premise of giving priority to the state, then the commune, and then the individual. Third, it is also necessary to continue to carry out the struggle between the two roads, use ironclad facts to thoroughly refute the "wait-and-see faction," the "autumn reckoning faction," and the "production pessimists," and resolutely crack down on the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements to consolidate the socialist system.

II. Vigorously develop industrial and agricultural production, further organize the overall great leap forward, and create a solid material foundation for consolidating and improving the communes. At present, we should seize the favorable opportunity to vigorously engage in iron and steel production, continue to strengthen the late-stage management of autumn fields, so as to strive for even greater harvests. At the same time, vigorously carry out the agricultural tool reform movement to ensure the realization of agricultural semi-mechanization in the province in October. Do a good job in autumn harvesting and planting in a timely manner, especially to concentrate all manpower, livestock, and materials in the commune to break through the barrier of deep plowing of land.

III. Correctly solve system problems and strengthen business management. We must improve various organizations in the communes according to the principles of centralized leadership, democratic management, being conducive to the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and the close integration and mutual promotion of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. The scale of the communes should be temporarily stabilized and no longer changed, and efforts should be concentrated on large-scale production and construction. The scope of the powers of organizations at all levels within the commune should be rationally determined according to the principle of "unified management, and decentralized administration," and the management system should be actively improved.

IV. Conscientiously do the autumn distribution of the commune, adhere to the principle of "first the public, then the commune, then the commune members," and correctly handle the relationship between the state, the commune, and the commune members. This year's ratio of accumulation to consumption, on the basis of increasing production, should first ensure the completion of the state's requisition tasks for public grain and grain, tobacco, cotton, oil and other agricultural and sideline products; actively expand public accumulation within the commune, generally taking about 70% of the total income as accumulation (including public grain and all deductions within the commune) to expand reproduction; the remaining 30% or so should be used as the distribution portion for commune members (including wages and the supply system portion) to appropriately improve the lives of commune members. In handling the relationship between the commune and its members, we should continue to adhere to the principle of "to each according to his ability, to each according to his work," and strive to increase communist factors. Communes should universally promote the grain supply system or food supply system. After the implementation of the grain or food supply system, the remaining part will then adopt the wage system of "to each according to his work." A small number of communes with good economic conditions, high production income, and high awareness of commune members that have already announced the implementation of a living supply system plus a wage system can consolidate this system. The distribution of the "to each according to his work" portion is generally appropriate to adopt the wage system, and the method of "basic wage plus bonus" or the method of "fixed work points, paid according to the number of days worked" can be adopted. A small number of those with poor conditions who cannot implement the wage system for the time being can also adopt the method of "two distributions throughout the year, unified final settlement." In the distribution work, it is also necessary to fully promote the communist spirit, adhere to the principle of unified distribution, and properly handle the problems of large disparities in production between the original small communes and large disparities in labor remuneration.

V. Vigorously run collective life centered on canteens. Running public canteens well is not only an economic task, but also a political task, and it is an important aspect of running people's communes well. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the political education of the broad masses of commune members, criticize the capitalist ideology of a small number of well-to-do middle peasants, and consolidate the public canteens. The management of public canteens should adhere to the principles of eating enough, eating well, and avoiding waste; and should fully promote democracy and absorb commune members to participate in management. The elderly, the sick, infants, and pregnant women must be well taken care of.

The meeting believed that strengthening the leadership of the Party is the decisive key to further consolidating and improving the People's Communes. Party committees at all levels should conscientiously implement the principle of "lean organization and cadres not divorced from production" as instructed by the Party Central Committee, and establish and improve the leading organs of the People's Communes. The cadres of the communes should all be poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and activists in building socialism who are both red and expert.

    怎样巩固人民公社？
    河南采取五项措施：加强共产主义教育  大力发展工农业生产  正确解决体制问题  切实做好秋季分配工作  办好公共食堂
    本报讯　“书记挂帅，全党全民总动员，从政治思想、分配、生活、管理制度、组织建设等方面，把人民公社办好，促进工农业生产全面大跃进。”这是中共河南省委农村工作部于8月26日到9月7日召开的地（市）、县农村工作部长会议，对当前巩固提高人民公社提出的战斗任务。
    会议认为，河南省人民公社化运动是完全符合中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议和毛主席的指示精神，因此，人民公社运动是健康的。各地人民公社建立后，都有许多社员自愿地将自留地、成片林木、大型农具以及猪、羊等交公社所有，进一步消灭了生产资料私有制的残余，为向共产主义社会过渡创造了良好条件。由于生产关系的改变，更加促进了人们的思想大跃进，到处出现了“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义新风尚。随着人民公社化的实现，不仅大大地促进了工农业生产的全面发展，而且也大大地改变了农村社会的面貌。
    会议指出，当前的任务是如何巩固提高人民公社的问题。会议认为：应当密切结合大办钢铁和秋收秋种，对人民公社普遍进行一次巩固提高工作，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，促进各项社会主义建设事业的更大发展。在目前应当抓好五项工作。
    一、向所有社员进行一次社会主义和共产主义教育。继续加强政治思想工作，贯彻执行中共中央“关于今冬明春在农村中普遍展开社会主义和共产主义教育运动”的指示，是提高和巩固人民公社的关键。进行这一工作的内容首先是通过总结夏、秋两季农业空前大丰收的经验和讨论社章，进一步提高广大农民的政治觉悟和生产积极性。其次，继续宣传贯彻民主办社和“勤俭办社”的方针，在先国家、后社、再个人的前提下，正确处理积累和分配的关系。第三，还必须继续开展两条道路的斗争，用铁的事实彻底驳倒“观潮派”、“秋后算账派”、“生产悲观论者”，并坚决打击地、富、反、坏分子的破坏活动，巩固社会主义制度。
    二、大力发展工农业生产，进一步组织全面大跃进，为巩固提高公社创造雄厚的物质基础。当前应抓紧有利时机，大办钢铁生产，继续加强秋田后期管理，以争取更大丰收。同时，大力开展农具改革运动，保证10月份全省实现农业半机械化。适时做好秋收秋种工作，特别要集中社内一切人力、畜力、物力突破深翻土地关。
    三、正确解决体制问题，加强经营管理。要根据集中领导，民主管理，有利于农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展，工、农、商、学、兵密切结合，互相促进的原则，健全公社中的各种组织机构。社的规模要暂时稳定下来不再变动，集中力量大搞生产建设。公社内各级组织的职权范围，要根据“统一经营，分级管理”的原则，合理确定，并积极改进管理制度。
    四、切实做好公社的秋季分配，坚持“先公后社再社员”的原则，正确处理国家、公社和社员的关系。今年积累和消费的比例，在增加生产的基础上，应首先保证完成国家公粮和粮、烟、棉、油料以及其他农副产品的征购任务；积极扩大社内公共积累，一般应以总收入的70％左右作为积累（包括公粮和社内的一切扣除），扩大再生产；其余的30％左右作为社员分配部分（包括工资和供给制部分），适当改善社员生活。在处理社与社员之间的关系上，应在继续坚持执行“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的分配原则下，尽力增长共产主义因素。公社应普遍推广吃粮供给制或伙食供给制，实行吃粮或伙食供给制后的剩余部分，再采取按劳取酬的工资制办法。少数经济条件好、生产收入多、社员觉悟较高的社，已宣布实行了生活供给制加工资制的，可以巩固下来。“按劳取酬”部分的分配，一般以采取工资制为宜，可以采取“基本工资加奖励”的办法，也可以采用“固定工值，按劳动日付资”的办法。少数确实条件较差，暂时不能实行工资制的，还可以采取“全年两次分配，统一决算”的办法。在分配工作中，还要充分发扬共产主义精神，坚持统一分配的原则，妥善处理原小社之间生产好坏悬殊和劳动报酬高低悬殊的问题。
    五、大力办好以食堂为中心的集体生活。办好公共食堂不仅是一项经济工作，而且是一项政治工作，它是办好人民公社的一个重要方面。因此，必须加强对广大社员的政治教育，批判少数富裕中农的资本主义思想，巩固公共食堂。公共食堂的管理工作，应以吃饱、吃好、不浪费为原则；应充分发扬民主，吸收社员参加管理。对于老年、病人、幼儿、产妇，必须很好照顾。
    会议认为：加强党的领导，是进一步巩固提高人民公社的决定关键。各级党委应该切实贯彻执行党中央所指示的“组织精悍、干部不脱离生产”的原则，建立与健全人民公社的领导机构。公社的干部都应该是贫农、下中农和又红又专的建设社会主义积极分子。
