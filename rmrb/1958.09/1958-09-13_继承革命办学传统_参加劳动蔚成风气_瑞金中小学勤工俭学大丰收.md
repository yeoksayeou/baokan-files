    Inheriting the Revolutionary Tradition of Running Schools, Participating in Labor Becomes a Trend
    A Great Harvest of Work-Study Programs in Ruijin Primary and Secondary Schools

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Reporter Liu Guanghui reports: Ruijin County, the old revolutionary base area, inheriting and carrying forward the revolutionary tradition of running schools in the Soviet era, has achieved three great harvests in learning, ideology, and production through the work-study programs carried out in its primary and secondary schools this year.

    After liberation, Ruijin's education has seen rapid development. To date, seven public middle schools and one hundred and seven private middle schools have been newly established, with six thousand middle school students; there are four hundred and eighty-four public primary schools and three hundred and twenty-six private primary schools, with more than thirty-six thousand primary school students, popularizing primary education. Illiteracy was eliminated in June of this year, making it the first county without illiteracy in Jiangxi Province.

    All the newly established middle and primary schools in Ruijin have carried out work-study programs, combining education with productive labor. Especially this year, the methods and content of work-study activities in primary and secondary schools have become more diverse, the scale larger, and the students' enthusiasm for activities higher, further integrating education with productive labor. In work-study programs, primary and secondary school students engage in agricultural production and public welfare labor. For example, running farms, experimental fields, reclaiming wasteland, developing tea mountains, raising fish, raising livestock, organizing carpentry and bamboo work labor groups, or delivering fertilizer to surrounding agricultural cooperatives, etc. Students from Ruijin No. 1 Middle School and No. 2 Middle School reclaimed more than five thousand mu of wasteland and barren mountains this year, each running a farm. No. 1 Middle School adopts a rotating shift method, with two classes at a time moving to the farm for a week of labor and production, and combining labor lessons with production there; students at school use Sundays and two days of after-school time each week to participate in bamboo work, carpentry, and livestock raising.

    Due to the implementation of work-study programs, students have received labor training. They all take pride in loving labor and actively participating in labor, initially establishing a labor perspective, and the bad habits of seeking easy work and comparing clothes have been swept away. They say: "The hoe and the pen are two weapons that we cannot lack. One is to march towards nature, and the other is to march towards science. Both weapons are equally important." Competing to see who labors better, who has a darker complexion, and who has thicker calluses on their palms has become the trend. Many students have now developed "three thicknesses" (thick skin on the soles of their feet, thick skin on their palms, and thick skin on their shoulders), and have mastered many labor skills. Liang Wentuo and Liang Zhongping, students at Jiu Yan Junior Middle School, used to dislike labor, finding it tiring, dirty, and embarrassing, and were unwilling to participate in labor; after the implementation of work-study programs, they now charge ahead in labor, and can plow fields, transplant rice seedlings, and weed, and have been named activists in work-study. Half of the students in this school have learned to plow fields and fertilize.

    Work-study programs combine education with labor production, and textbook knowledge with practice, ensuring that knowledge is firmly grasped, and students' grades rise in a straight line. Zhangshu Primary School uses its own labor-based experimental garden for lessons, learning both textbook knowledge and operational skills. This year, more than half of the three hundred students in the school received a total score of five in each subject. In addition, work-study programs have solved the school's financial difficulties and students' learning expenses. In the first half of this year, students throughout the county earned more than 40,000 yuan through work-study programs. Zhangshu Primary School's income can cover the school's office expenses and 70% of the students' living and learning expenses.

    继承革命办学传统　参加劳动蔚成风气
    瑞金中小学勤工俭学大丰收
    本报讯　记者刘光辉报道：革命故乡瑞金县继承和发扬苏区时代的革命办学传统，中、小学今年开展的勤工俭学活动，取得了学习、思想、生产上的三大丰收。
    解放后，瑞金教育事业有了飞跃发展。至今新办了公立中学七所、民办中学一百零七所，中学生有六千名；公立小学四百八十四所、民办小学三百二十六所，小学生有三万六千多人，普及了小学教育。今年6月扫除了文盲，成为江西省第一个无文盲县。
    瑞金所有新办的中、小学里都开展了勤工俭学活动，使教育与生产劳动结合起来。特别是今年来，中、小学的勤工俭学活动的方式、内容更多，规模更大，学生们搞活动的劲头更高，教育与生产劳动结合得更好。在勤工俭学活动中，中小学学生们从事农业生产和社会公益劳动。如：办农场、办试验田、垦荒、开垦茶山、养鱼、养家畜，组织木工、竹工劳动小组，或给周围农业社送肥料，等等。瑞金第一中学和第二中学的学生今年开垦了五千多亩荒地和荒山，各办了一个农场。一中学采用轮班的办法，每二班一轮搬到农场劳动生产一星期，并在那里结合生产上劳动课；在校学生利用星期日和每周的两天的课余时间参加竹工、木工、饲养家畜劳动。
    由于勤工俭学活动的开展，使学生们受到了劳动锻炼。他们都以热爱劳动、积极参加劳动为荣，初步树立了劳动观点，过去的想找轻活、比吃穿的坏习气一扫而光。他们说：“锄头、笔杆是我们都不能缺少的两支武器，一支向自然进军，一支向科学进军，两支武器同样重要。”比谁劳动好、比谁脸黑、比谁的手掌上茧厚成了风气。许多学生现在锻炼得有三厚（脚掌皮厚、手掌皮厚、肩膀皮厚），并掌握了许多劳动技术。九堰初级中学学生梁文托、梁中平过去嫌劳动累、脏、丢面子，不愿参加劳动；经过勤工俭学活动的开展，现在变得劳动打冲锋，会犁田、插秧、锄草，被评为勤工俭学积极分子。这个学校已有半数学生学会了犁田和施肥。
    勤工俭学活动使教育结合劳动生产，课本知识结合了实践，掌握知识牢靠，学生的成绩直线上升。樟树小学运用自己劳动的试验园地上课，既学到了书本知识，又学会了操作技术，今年全校三百名学生中有半数以上各科成绩总评得五分。此外，勤工俭学活动解决了学校经费困难和学生的学习费用。今年上半年全县学生在勤工俭学中的收入有四万多元。樟树小学的收入可以解决全校的办公费用和70％的学生的生活、学习费用。
