The Chiang Kai-shek Air Force, under the command of the U.S. military command in Taiwan, used "Sidewinder" missiles to attack our aircraft on September 24th while intruding into the airspace over the Wenzhou area of Zhejiang Province, China. This is an escalation of military provocations by the U.S. imperialists, using the Chiang Kai-shek clique, to achieve the U.S. war conspiracy of expanding its aggression against China. This serious provocative incident has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people. The spokesman of our Ministry of National Defense has been instructed to solemnly announce: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army will certainly take punitive action against this crime of the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force." Peace-loving countries and people all over the world should be seriously vigilant and resolutely stop the war conspiracy of the United States.

The Chiang Kai-shek aircraft's use of "Sidewinder" missiles is obviously a pre-determined step in the U.S. aggressive war plan. The F86F jet fighters and the "Sidewinder" missiles used by the Chiang Kai-shek clique in this intrusion into the airspace over mainland China were recently supplied by the United States. The Chiang Kai-shek clique did not have aircraft of this type or missiles of this kind in the past. It should be particularly pointed out that just two days before the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft used the "Sidewinder" missiles, the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in the Pacific, Admiral Felt, and the Commander of the U.S. Air Force in the Pacific, Carter, held a two-day military meeting with Chiang Kai-shek and his senior military personnel. According to U.S. news agencies, the U.S.-Chiang military meeting discussed issues such as the United States increasing its supply of equipment to the Chiang army and attacks on mainland China. On September 25, the day after the Chiang aircraft used the "Sidewinder" missiles, Dulles also said in a speech that "the use of force by either the United States or the Chiang Kai-shek clique will be a matter of common agreement." This fully proves that the Chiang aircraft's use of "Sidewinder" missiles was carried out under the planning and instruction of the U.S. aggressors. In fact, for a long time, the armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek clique have been under the command of the United States, and the joint U.S.-Chiang command center has long been established. The military activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique are dictated by U.S. generals.

People all over the world can now see more clearly: The U.S. engaging in talks with China in Warsaw and putting forward the so-called "ceasefire" proposal is obviously an attempt to deceive public opinion at home and abroad and cover up its war conspiracy. In fact, the United States is carrying out military deployments to expand its aggression in the Taiwan Strait area and is stepping up its military provocations against China. U.S. aircraft and warships, ignoring our repeated warnings, are increasingly frequently intruding into our territorial airspace and waters. This time, it even instructed Chiang aircraft to use "Sidewinder" missiles. There have long been rumors that the U.S. aggressors were preparing to use missiles. The British "Manchester Guardian" once reported that "some (U.S.) Navy and Air Force generals may be eager to try out their new weapons on mainland China." Now, the U.S. aggressors, ignoring the condemnation of world public opinion, have directed Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft to start using missile weapons. This further proves how shamefully deceptive Eisenhower and Dulles' repeated declarations of "commitment to glorious peace" and "resolving international disputes by peaceful means" are.

The Chinese people will never be intimidated by any new type of weapon. We know how to retaliate against provocateurs with redoubled force. The spokesman of our Ministry of National Defense has clearly announced that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which has committed this crime, will certainly not escape the punishment it deserves. The U.S. aggressors who directed the Chiang Kai-shek clique to use missiles should know that the fire they have ignited will burn them. The debt owed by the U.S. aggressors must be repaid.

Because the United States directed Chiang aircraft to use "Sidewinder" missiles, the situation in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area has become even more serious. It should be pointed out that the U.S. aggressors' direction of the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force to use "Sidewinder" missiles is an extremely serious military provocation, because missiles were not used either in World War II or in the Korean War. This is the first time in the history of world warfare that missiles have been used. U.S. imperialism has placed the danger of missile and nuclear weapons warfare before the people of the world. The urgent task of all peace-loving countries and people in the world is to immediately stop the U.S. aggressors' provocation against all mankind!

    打击挑衅者
    侵台美军司令部指挥的蒋介石空军，24日在窜入我国大陆浙江省温州地区上空，使用了“响尾蛇”导弹对我国飞机进行攻击。这是美帝国主义利用蒋介石集团加紧军事挑衅，以达到美国扩大对中国的侵略的战争阴谋。这一严重的挑衅事件激起了中国人民极大的愤怒。我国防部发言人已奉命郑重宣布：“中国人民解放军对于蒋介石空军的这种罪行，必将采取惩罚性的打击。”全世界爱好和平的国家和人民应当严重警惕并且坚决制止美国的战争阴谋。
    蒋介石飞机这次使用了“响尾蛇”导弹，显然是美国的侵略战争计划的预定步骤。这次窜入我国大陆上空的蒋介石集团的F86F型喷气飞机和使用的“响尾蛇”导弹都是美国最近供给的，过去蒋介石集团没有这样类型的飞机，更没有这样的导弹。特别应当指出的是，就在蒋介石飞机使用“响尾蛇”导弹的前两天，美国的太平洋区美军总司令费耳特海军上将和太平洋区空军司令卡特才同蒋介石和他的高级军事人员举行了为时两天的军事会议。据美国的通讯社说，美蒋军事会议中曾经讨论了美国增加供应蒋军装备和对中国大陆的攻击等问题。在蒋机使用“响尾蛇”导弹的后一天，9月25日，杜勒斯还在演讲中说：美国和蒋介石集团“双方中任何一方使用武力的问题将为共同协议之事项”。这就完全证明了蒋机使用“响尾蛇”导弹是在美国侵略者策划和指使下进行的。事实上许久以来，蒋介石集团的武装部队是受美国指挥的，美蒋的联合指挥中心早已成立。蒋介石集团的军事活动是听命于美国将军的。
    全世界人民现在都可以看得更清楚了：美国在华沙同中国进行会谈，并且提出所谓“停火”的主张，显然是企图欺骗美国国内外舆论，掩护它的战争阴谋。实际上美国正在台湾海峡地区进行扩大侵略的军事部署，并加紧对中国的军事挑衅，美国的飞机和军舰不顾我国的再三警告，日益频繁地侵入我国领空和领海，这次竟然指使蒋机使用“响尾蛇”导弹。本来美国侵略者准备使用导弹已经早有传闻。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”曾经报道，“一些（美国）海军和空军将军们可能急于对中国大陆试用他们的新武器。”现在，美国侵略者竟然不顾世界舆论的谴责，指挥蒋介石飞机开始使用导弹武器了。这益加证明了：艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯一再宣称“致力于光荣的和平”、“用和平方法解决国际争端”等等，是多么可耻的骗人把戏。
    中国人民决不是什么新式武器所能吓倒的。我们知道怎样对挑衅者给以加倍的回击。我国防部发言人已经明确地宣布了，犯下了这次罪行的蒋介石卖国集团一定逃不了应得的惩罚。曾指使蒋介石集团使用导弹的美国侵略者应该知道，他们自己点起来的火会把他们自己烧毁的。美国侵略者欠下的这笔债是必须偿还的。
    由于美国指使蒋机使用了“响尾蛇”导弹，台湾和台湾海峡地区的局势更加严重了。应该指出：美国侵略者指使蒋介石空军使用了“响尾蛇”导弹是极其严重的军事挑衅，因为无论在第二次世界大战中和朝鲜战争中，都没有使用过导弹。这是世界战争历史上第一次使用了导弹。美帝国主义已经把导弹和核武器的战争危险摆在全世界人民面前。全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的迫切任务，就是立即制止美国侵略者向全人类的挑衅！
