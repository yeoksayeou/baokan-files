Premier Kim Il-sung said that today, the socialist transformation of production relations in both urban and rural areas of North Korea has been completed, and our society has become a socialist society. He said that the main task at present is to consolidate and further develop the socialist system in northern Korea, so as to complete the socialist revolution as soon as possible and gradually embark on the road of communist construction.

In his speech, Premier Kim Il-sung emphasized the importance of realizing socialist industrialization. He said that to this end, two important tasks must be completed: strengthening the socialist education of the working people and mastering advanced technology, and completing the technical revolution.

He pointed out that it is necessary to increase the production of grain and textiles, and build more houses. In order to solve the problems of clothing, food, and housing, it is necessary to produce more electricity, coal, and steel, develop the chemical industry and the production of man-made fibers, and develop the relatively backward machinery industry, while also establishing handicraft workshops.

In his speech, Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out the importance of carrying out technical revolution in all sectors of the national economy. He explained the issue of developing collective innovation movements. He said that the innovation movement should not be limited to a small number of people but should be carried out by the masses. He also said that the more heroes that appear, the better.

He emphasized that the struggle against conservatism must be carried out. In his speech, he focused on criticizing conservative ideas that regard industry, technology, and science as mysterious and worship foreign standards. He called on the people to continue to ride the Chollima with even greater revolutionary enthusiasm and complete the first five-year plan.
