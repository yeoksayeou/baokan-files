Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: The new Ambassador of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to China, Mr. Panchevsky, accompanied by all the diplomats of the Embassy, presented his credentials to Vice Chairman Zhu De this afternoon.

Present at the ceremony were: Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Director of the Department of Socialist Countries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Wang Yutian, and Director of the Protocol Department Yu Peiwen.

When presenting his credentials, Ambassador Panchevsky delivered a eulogy, saying: "I am honored to present to you the credentials of the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the People's Republic of China, and I am very pleased to do so. Please allow me to convey to you and the friendly Chinese people the sincere respect of the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian Government, and the wonderful feelings of our people towards your great country.

"Respected Comrade Vice Chairman, the People's Republic of China is now in a new stage of unprecedented upsurge, leaping forward along the road of socialism, and I feel very happy to come to this great country, friendly to our country, at this time. Under the wise and courageous leadership of its own Communist Party and People's Government, the Chinese people have completed the socialist transformation of the economy, politics, and ideology in a short period of time, and are now exerting revolutionary efforts to build China into a great socialist industrial country at an incredible speed. The amazing achievements made by the Chinese working people in the socialist construction of their motherland, especially in the past few months, make every Bulgarian happy and inspire our people to fight for the further prosperity of socialist Bulgaria.

"People's China is a strong pillar of peace in the Far East and the world. The People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a peaceful policy and has made great contributions to opposing the aggressive plans of the imperialist forces, defending world peace, and easing international tensions. The attempts of some imperialist countries, especially the United States, to ignore the People's Republic of China on the international stage are both pitiful and ridiculous, because the extremely important role of the People's Republic of China in international life does not depend on the wishes of those who are hostile to China, but on the objective fact that it exists as a great peace-loving force.

"The People's Republic of Bulgaria and the People's Republic of China are two loyal and strong members of the great family of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. The attempts of the enemies of socialism to undermine our rock-solid unity from within are futile. The Moscow meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries last year and the recent meeting in Beijing between the party and government leaders of the two cornerstones of the great socialist camp – the Soviet Union and China – brilliantly demonstrated this.

"The Bulgarian people highly appreciate the courageous and principled struggle made by the Chinese Communist Party against modern revisionists who oppose Marxism, as well as the great contribution made by the People's Republic of China to further strengthening the unity of the socialist camp, which is the main guarantee for safeguarding world peace and the further comprehensive development of our socialist countries.

"I am pleased to point out that the unbreakable friendship between our two countries, built on the basis of common interests in the struggle for peace and socialism, is being consolidated day by day. The political, economic, and cultural cooperation between our two countries, based on the principles of proletarian internationalism and socialist mutual assistance, is constantly developing. In international relations, Bulgaria and China consistently implement a policy of peace, resolutely repelling aggression and peaceful coexistence.

"Respected Comrade Vice Chairman, on the occasion of my assumption of the post of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to the People's Republic of China, I would like to assure you that I will do everything in my power to work for the further strengthening and development of the friendly, cooperative, and mutually beneficial relations between our two countries. I am confident that in this regard I will receive your valuable assistance and that of the Government of the People's Republic of China.

"Comrade Vice Chairman, please allow me to once again express my sincere brotherly wishes on behalf of the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Government, and all the Bulgarian people, wishing China new achievements in the cause of socialist construction, and wishing you personally good health and happiness."

Vice Chairman Zhu De replied, saying: "I am very pleased to accept the credentials presented by you from the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria appointing you as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the People's Republic of China, and I express my heartfelt thanks for your friendly congratulations.

"Under the leadership of the long-tested Bulgarian Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the industrious, courageous, peace-loving, and freedom-loving Bulgarian people have made brilliant achievements in the great cause of socialist construction, transforming Bulgaria from an agricultural country into a country with developed industry and large-scale cooperative and mechanized agriculture. Now, the Bulgarian people are confidently implementing the instructions of the Third Five-Year Plan for further developing the national economy, which was adopted not long ago by the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party. This instruction presents the Bulgarian people with an infinitely bright future. Bulgaria has made important contributions to consolidating the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism, opposing contemporary revisionism, opposing the aggression of imperialism, and safeguarding peace in the Balkans and the world. The Chinese people deeply admire and are encouraged by these achievements and contributions of the fraternal Bulgarian people.

"In recent years, the friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian peoples and their mutual assistance and cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields have greatly developed. I am convinced that on the common road of building socialism, under the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, this friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries will be increasingly consolidated and developed. This will not only benefit the vigorous socialist construction of our two countries, but also benefit the further strengthening of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the strengthening of the world's forces for peace and democracy.

"Comrade Ambassador, I warmly welcome you to assume the post of the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to the Republic of China. In your work to consolidate and develop friendly cooperation between China and Bulgaria, you will receive the full support of Chairman Mao Zedong and myself, and of the Government of the People's Republic of China.

"I wish you complete success in your work."

Xinhua News Agency: Panchevsky, the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to China, paid a courtesy call on Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, on August 26th to discuss matters related to the presentation of credentials. Wang Yutian, Director of the Department of Socialist Countries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Zhang Shijie, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department, were present at the meeting.

Panchevsky, the new Bulgarian Ambassador to China, arrived in Beijing by plane on August 25th. Zhang Shijie, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was at the airport to welcome him.

　　保新任大使向朱副主席递交国书
    新华社31日讯　保加利亚人民共和国新任驻中国大使潘切夫斯基今天下午偕大使馆全体外交官，向朱德副主席递交国书。
    在场的有：外交部副部长章汉夫，外交部社会主义国家司司长王雨田，礼宾司司长俞沛文。
    递交国书时，潘切夫斯基大使致颂词说：“我荣幸地向您递交保加利亚人民共和国国民议会主席团任命我为驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使的国书和召回前任大使的国书，并且为此感到非常高兴。请允许我向您和友好的中国人民转达保加利亚人民共和国国民议会主席团和保加利亚政府的衷心的敬意和我国人民对你们伟大国家的美好的感情。
    “尊敬的副主席同志，中华人民共和国正处在沿着社会主义道路飞跃发展的空前高涨的新阶段，我能在这个时候来到这个伟大的、同我国友好的国家，感到很幸福。中国人民在自己的共产党和人民政府的英明和果敢的领导下，在短时期内完成了经济、政治和思想方面的社会主义改造，现在正在鼓足革命干劲，用难以置信的飞快速度把中国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义工业国。中国劳动人民在祖国的社会主义建设事业中所取得的，特别是在最近几个月里所取得的惊人成就，使得每个保加利亚人感到高兴，并且鼓舞着我国人民为争取社会主义保加利亚的进一步繁荣而斗争。
    “人民中国是远东和世界和平的坚强支柱。中华人民共和国一贯奉行和平政策，对反对帝国主义势力的侵略计划、保卫世界和平和和缓国际紧张局势作出了巨大的贡献。一些帝国主义国家，首先是美国，在国际舞台上无视中华人民共和国的企图是既可怜又可笑的，因为中华人民共和国在国际生活中的极端重要的作用并不是取决于敌视中国的那些人的愿望，而是取决于它作为一个爱好和平的伟大力量而存在的客观事实。
    “保加利亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国大家庭中的忠诚的和坚强的两个成员。社会主义的敌人想从内部来破坏我们的坚如磐石的团结的企图是徒劳的。去年各国共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议和不久以前在北京举行的伟大的社会主义阵营的两个砥柱——苏联和中国——的党政领导人的会谈光辉地证明了这一点。
      “保加利亚人民对中国共产党向反对马克思主义的现代修正主义者所作的勇敢的原则性斗争以及中华人民共和国对进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结所作的巨大贡献给予高度的评价，社会主义阵营是维护世界和平和我们社会主义各国进一步全面发展的主要保证。
    “我高兴地指出，我们两国建筑在为和平和社会主义而斗争的共同利益的基础上的牢不可破的友谊正在日益巩固。我们两国间以无产阶级国际主义和社会主义互助的原则为基础的政治、经济和文化方面的合作正在不断地发展。在国际关系方面，保中两国一贯实行和平、坚决击退侵略和和平共处的政策。
    “尊敬的副主席同志，在我就任保加利亚人民共和国驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使职务的时候，我愿意向您保证，我将尽一切力量为进一步加强和发展我们两国之间的友好、合作和互助关系而工作。我深信，在这方面我会得到您和中华人民共和国政府的珍贵的协助。
      “副主席同志，请允许我代表保加利亚人民共和国国民议会主席团、保加利亚政府和全体保加利亚人民再一次向您表达诚挚的兄弟般的祝愿，祝中国在社会主义建设事业中获得新的成就，并且祝您本人健康和幸福。”
    朱德副主席致答词说：“我很高兴地接受您所递交的保加利亚人民共和国国民议会主席团任命您为驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使的国书，并且对您的友好祝贺表示衷心的感谢。
    “勤劳、勇敢、热爱和平和自由的保加利亚人民，在久经考验的保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民共和国政府的领导下，在伟大的社会主义建设事业中，取得了辉煌的成就，把保加利亚从一个农业国变成一个具有发达的工业和大规模合作化和机械化的农业的国家。现在，保加利亚人民正在满怀信心地执行着不久以前保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会通过的进一步发展国民经济的第三个五年计划的指示。这个指示为保加利亚人民展示了无限美好的远景。保加利亚在巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁、反对现代修正主义、反对帝国主义的侵略和维护巴尔干和世界和平的事业中，都作出了重要的贡献。中国人民对于兄弟的保加利亚人民的这些成就和贡献，深为钦佩，并且感到欢欣鼓舞。
    “近年来，中保两国人民的友谊和在政治、经济、文化各方面的互助合作，都获得了很大的发展。我深信，在建设社会主义的共同道路上，在马克思列宁主义的伟大旗帜下，我们两国的这种友谊和互助合作必将日益巩固和发展。这不仅有利于我们两国的蓬勃发展的社会主义建设事业，而且也有利于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的进一步壮大和世界和平民主力量的加强。
    “大使同志，我热烈地欢迎您出任保加利亚人民共和国驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使。在您为巩固和发展中保两国友好合作的工作中，您将得到毛泽东主席和我以及中华人民共和国政府的全力支持。
    “祝您在工作中获得完全的成功。”
    新华社讯　保加利亚人民共和国驻华特命全权大使潘切夫斯基于8月26日拜会我外交部副部长章汉夫，商谈递交国书事宜。拜会时在座的有外交部社会主义国家司司长王雨田，礼宾司副司长张世杰。
