Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: Tokyo News: In order to cooperate with American imperialism in creating tension in the Far East, the U.S. military stationed in Japan and the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" have recently held a series of joint large-scale exercises involving the army, navy, and air force throughout Japan over the past month.

    "Akahata" [Red Flag Newspaper] pointed out in its report on the joint military exercises conducted by the U.S. and Japanese forces that the exercises were not only large in scale but also varied in type, including: operations against airborne troops, landing operations, and air combat.

    According to reports, in addition to the joint large-scale exercises, the U.S. Air Force also plans to hold air combat exercises and air force-to-ground combat exercises over Tokyo and other places for a month from August 20 to September 19.

    "Akahata" also reported that the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" will hold a joint army, navy, and air force nuclear weapons combat exercise starting in early October.
    Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: Tokyo News: Japan's "Akahata" [Red Flag Newspaper] reported that the United States is conducting preparations for atomic warfare in South Korea.

    The report said that the U.S. Eighth Army has already established a missile command in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, South Korea, and has built a missile base near Chuncheon. U.S. Eighth Army Commander Decker told reporters not long ago that the U.S. military is prepared to stay in South Korea for ten years. Decker also said that the United States is conducting preparations for atomic warfare in South Korea. "Akahata" pointed out that these circumstances indicate that the United States is preparing to occupy South Korea for a long time and make South Korea a forward base for its atomic warfare.

    "Akahata" wrote that the Syngman Rhee clique has expanded its puppet army from sixteen divisions at the time of the Korean Armistice to the current thirty-one divisions, totaling 710,000 men, and is undergoing nuclear armament with the support of the United States.

    Syngman Rhee said that his army had prepared to "advance north" twice after the Korean Armistice.

    "Akahata" pointed out that the U.S. plot to establish missile bases in South Korea and prepare to provoke atomic warfare is the most blatant provocation against world peace.

    在日本搞联合军事演习　在南朝鲜进行原子备战
　　美国加紧制造远东紧张局势
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：为了配合美帝国主义在远东制造紧张局势，驻日美军和日本“自卫队”最近一个月以来在日本全国各地举行了一系列的有陆、海、空三军参加的联合大演习。
    “赤旗报”在报道美日军队举行联合演习的消息中指出，这次演习不仅规模庞大，而且演习的种类也颇多，其中包括：对空运队作战、登陆作战和空战等。
    据报道，除了联合大演习之外，美国空军还计划从8月20日到9月19日的一个月期间，在东京等地上空举行空战演习和空军对地面作战等演习。
    “赤旗报”还报道，日本“自卫队”将从10月初起举行一次陆、海、空三军核武器作战联合演习。
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本“赤旗报”报道，美国正在南朝鲜进行原子战争的备战活动。
    消息说，美国第八军已经在南朝鲜江原道的春川设立了导弹司令部，并且在春川附近建立了导弹基地。美国第八军司令德克尔不久前向记者说，美国军队准备在南朝鲜呆十年。德克尔还说，美国正在南朝鲜进行原子战争的备战活动。“赤旗报”指出，这些情况表明，美国准备长期霸占南朝鲜，并且使南朝鲜成为它进行原子战争的前哨基地。
    “赤旗报”写道，李承晚集团已经把它的傀儡军队从朝鲜停战当时的十六个师团扩充到目前的三十一个师团，共七十一万人，并且在美国的扶植下正在进行核武装。
    李承晚说过，他的军队在朝鲜停战以后曾经准备两次“北进”。
    “赤旗报”指出，美国在南朝鲜建立导弹基地和准备挑起原子战争的阴谋，是对世界和平的最露骨的挑衅。
