The Noose Around the Neck of U.S. Imperialism
Chen Jun

In the Supreme State Conference, Chairman Mao Zedong, in his analysis of the current international situation, pointed out that if U.S. imperialism persists in pursuing its policies of aggression and war, it will inevitably be sentenced to death by hanging by the people of the world one day. The U.S.'s aggressive and war-mongering policies have already created nooses for itself and placed them around its own neck. The other ends of these nooses have been handed to the Chinese people, the people of Arab countries, and all peace-loving and anti-aggression people around the world. Chairman Mao's analysis further demonstrates the general trend of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, which has already occurred and continues to develop in the international situation, allowing the people of the world to see the essence of the U.S. paper tiger more clearly through the phenomena of U.S. imperialism seeking trouble and creating tension everywhere. Chairman Mao's analysis of the international situation is also a serious warning to U.S. imperialism.

This article intends to discuss this issue through the development of several events.

Enemies With 600 Million People
--Entering a Dead End

Eight years ago, the U.S. militarily occupied China's territory of Taiwan. According to Dulles's latest statement, the U.S. occupation of Taiwan is "of extreme importance to the vital interests of the United States and all friendly countries in the Pacific and along the Pacific coast, with friendly governments securely controlling the island chain in the Western Pacific (of which Taiwan is a part)." Eight years before, MacArthur, who commanded the U.S. troops occupying Taiwan, said triumphantly that the U.S. considered Taiwan an "unsinkable aircraft carrier"; "controlling" Taiwan would allow the U.S. to "control every Asian seaport from Vladivostok to Singapore with its air force." From the mouths of the U.S. aggressors, it is not difficult to see that U.S. policymakers originally believed that occupying Taiwan would be very beneficial to realizing the plan to "make China disappear" and enslave Asia. However, in the past eight years, things have developed in the opposite direction. Being an enemy of 600 million Chinese people has led the U.S.'s Far East policy into a dead end.

The U.S. military occupation of China's territory of Taiwan occurred after the failure of the U.S.'s aggressive plan to wage a civil war through the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and enslave all of China. At that time, the new China was like the rising sun, with boundless radiance illuminating the East. Unwilling to accept defeat, U.S. imperialism could no longer care about the hypocritical mask of "friend," and carried out direct armed aggression that it had not dared to do during the Chinese civil war. The U.S.'s new aggression could not but arouse the indignation of the Chinese people. The smokescreens that U.S. imperialism had always used to deceive the Chinese people, such as the U.S. having "traditional friendship" with China and the U.S. having "no territorial ambitions" towards China, etc., all vanished at once, exposing the true face of U.S. imperialism nakedly in front of the Chinese people. The U.S., while launching the aggression against Korea, announced the occupation of China's Taiwan, following the old path of Japanese imperialism: to conquer Asia, one must first conquer China; to conquer China, one must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia; to conquer Manchuria and Mongolia, one must first conquer Korea and Taiwan. Could the Chinese people tolerate the U.S. aggressors following the old path of Japanese imperialism to re-enslave the Chinese people? For the sake of independence and freedom, and to defend the fruits of the revolution, the Chinese people united unprecedentedly. At the critical moment when the U.S. invading army was rushing towards the border of Northeast China, they fearlessly sent their outstanding sons and daughters to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protecting their homes and defending their country. The Chinese and Korean people who fought for justice were victorious. In the battle with the most powerful imperialist country in the world, the new China was not weakened or even "disappeared," but became stronger and stood tall on the earth. This fact could not but inspire all the oppressed nations in Asia and even the world, and open up bright prospects for all the nations still suffering.

Not only that, but Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times, and the Chinese people have the right to exercise their sovereignty and liberate Taiwan from the Chiang Kai-shek clique at an appropriate time and in an appropriate manner. This is the unwavering will of the Chinese people. U.S. imperialism's occupation of China's territory of Taiwan is a vain attempt to obstruct China from liberating its own territory, and placing its Seventh Fleet in the Taiwan Strait creates a situation where there is a danger of provoking a war with the Chinese people at any time. This situation is by no means what the U.S. says, protecting the security of the Pacific and the United States. On the contrary, it has become the root of the tense situation in the Far East. When Truman announced the occupation of Taiwan on June 27, 1950, because this act of aggression was too blatant, he repeatedly stated in order to deceive people that the occupation of Taiwan was a "temporary measure" caused by the Korean War. Although this statement was deceptive, it had to be admitted that this statement still left the U.S. aggressors a little room to escape. After the Korean War signed the armistice agreement in July 1953, the "temporary measures" of the U.S. occupation of Taiwan lost their basis. So in December 1954, the U.S. signed a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. In this way, Eisenhower and Dulles tied the slipknot of the noose around their necks into a fixed knot. The "mutual defense treaty" closely tied the fate of U.S. imperialism to the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty, which was spurned by the Chinese people and lingering on an isolated island. The "mutual defense treaty" is a treaty in which Chiang Kai-shek betrayed Taiwan, and for the Chinese people, it is illegal and invalid. However, the signing of this treaty once again made the Chinese people realize that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people.

Expanding the Scope of Aggression to Jinmen and Matsu
--Will Inevitably Tighten the Noose Around the Neck

In 1955, Eisenhower and Dulles again adopted the so-called "unfathomable policy" to obstruct China's liberation of Jinmen, Matsu, and other coastal islands. The U.S. Congress passed a joint resolution "authorizing the President to use U.S. armed forces to secure and protect relevant positions such as Jinmen and Matsu." At present, U.S. aggressors are using this joint resolution as an excuse to carry out military provocations and war threats against China, dreaming of intimidating the Chinese people with a "deterrence policy," giving up their sovereignty to liberate coastal islands, and stopping the punishment of the Chiang Kai-shek troops who are harassing China's coastal areas. This crazy provocation by U.S. imperialism has aroused a surge of anger against U.S. aggression among the 600 million people across the country. In the five days from September 6 to 11, 212 million people across the country participated in unprecedented large-scale demonstrations. With one heart and one mind, they will eliminate the aggressors from wherever they come. At present, the most serious war danger situation created by the U.S. since World War II has also educated and mobilized the people of the world to rise up against aggression and defend peace, placing U.S. imperialism in a completely isolated situation once again. Even in the U.S., it has aroused unprecedented panic, unease, and dissatisfaction with the government, and the government's current policies have been sharply criticized.

U.S. Senator Monroney said that interfering with China not only takes risks but also invites nuclear retaliation.

The Christian Science Monitor published several letters from readers on September 10 under the title "Readers Protest Far East Policy." James Warber of Connecticut wrote: "It is almost unimaginable that while our troops are still stationed in Lebanon, we are again on the verge of war with China over two small coastal island groups. These two island groups clearly belong to the mainland."

Norman Thomas of New York City wrote: "The worst thing is that numb or fatalistic attitude, letting Mr. Dulles threaten to drag us into a war for Jinmen, and sending our children to die for Chiang Kai-shek."

U.S. bourgeois public opinion and many political figures believe that the U.S.'s war provocation against China is suicidal. Joseph Alsop, a commentator for the New York Herald Tribune, said: "It is not easy for us to escape from the corner we have strangely fallen into." The Wall Street Journal said: "Defending the coastal islands of Nationalist China against Communist invasion has far less popular support than sending U.S. Marines to Lebanon in mid-July." Then honestly give up the intention of interfering in China's internal affairs and obstructing China's liberation of Jinmen and Matsu, and expanding the scope of aggression to China's coastal islands! However, the aggressors have even greater concerns. A commentator named Higgins sadly revealed this feeling: "Once you lose, it is very, very difficult to stop. The 'paper tiger' has no face in Asia." Former U.S. Secretary of State Acheson lamented: "Now the United States has lost control of the situation... the United States either falls into war or retreats. The government's attitude is this: it does not try to get us out of this situation in peaceful times, and it has no way to deal with it in times of crisis." This is the bitter fruit of the aggressive policy and strategy pursued by the U.S. monopoly capital group. It is in this way that it has put the noose it created around its own neck! If U.S. imperialism does not put away its bellicose policy and continues to be an enemy of the Chinese people, then 600 million Chinese people will inevitably become the executioners of the U.S. aggressors.

Opposing the Arab People
--Defeated More Miserably Each Time

This is the situation on the issue of U.S. aggression against Taiwan. Let's review the incident of U.S. aggression against Lebanon. The Iraqi people's revolution was victorious, and the U.S. hurriedly mobilized troops and landed in Lebanon, vainly attempting to extinguish the Arab people's national independence movement in one fell swoop. However, its aggressive plan was exposed and contained by the Arab people supported by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. However, the U.S. aggressors' invasion of Lebanon put another noose around their necks.

If, before the U.S. troops landed, what the Lebanese people opposed was just a Chamoun, and the common goal of the rebel forces was simply to demand Chamoun's resignation. What was the result of the U.S. sending troops to carry out armed intervention? Instead of Chamoun sitting more firmly on the presidential throne, all the Lebanese people were more strongly united in the face of the U.S. imperialism's tanks and cannons. In the program of the rebel forces, they added the goal of demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops and defending national independence and freedom. In front of the people of the world, an American robber who has always used the United Nations banner to cover up aggression and has always used the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to dress himself up as a "friend" of the Arab people, has stretched out his bloody murderer's hands this time. Everyone remembers that when the U.S. launched the war of aggression against Korea, it used the pretext of the United Nations to assemble sixteen countries to form an invading army. At that time, the U.S.'s voting machine could still play a role in the United Nations, passing resolutions that slandered the Chinese and Korean people. When Egypt recovered the sovereignty of the Suez Canal and was invaded by Britain and France, the U.S. also pretended to be upholding "justice," but found a "vacuum zone" from Britain and France. After Britain and France's aggression against the Middle East failed, U.S. imperialism raised the banner of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to "fill the vacuum." But when the Iraqi revolution broke out and an early morning caused the cornerstone of the U.S.'s aggression in the Middle East to collapse, the hypocritical "Eisenhower Doctrine" completely went bankrupt. So the U.S. took the stage with full force. The U.S.'s aggression not only educated the Arab people but also educated the people of the world once again. Righteous condemnation came from all over the world, forcing the U.S. to accept the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly. At this meeting, even if Eisenhower personally came out to try to clear the aggressors of their crimes and vainly attempted to obtain the United Nations banner again to legalize their crimes of aggression, things developed in the opposite direction. As a result, the U.S. was greatly disappointed. The United Nations voting machine is no longer the U.S.'s wishful thinking. The General Assembly passed a proposal by Arab countries that actually condemned U.S. and British aggression and demanded the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops. Now the U.S. is still delaying the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon, but the Lebanese people have warned the U.S. aggressors that if the U.S. troops do not withdraw, they will be met with iron fists! It is not difficult to predict that the longer the U.S. troops stay in Lebanon, the more resolute the resistance of the Lebanese and even the Arab people will be, and the tighter the noose that the U.S. has put on itself will be pulled.

Establishing Military Bases Everywhere
--Everywhere is a Volcano

The situation is like this on the Taiwan issue, and it is like this on the issue of U.S. occupation of Lebanon. Isn't the situation of military bases established by the U.S. everywhere in South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. the same? In all the places occupied by U.S. troops, the opposition of all the people who love freedom and independence on the occupied land cannot but be aroused. This opposition will inevitably grow with the extension of the U.S. troops' occupation time. May I ask, which self-respecting nation can tolerate U.S. aggressors running rampant, arbitrarily killing people, raping, and plundering on their own land? The old hatred of Japanese farmer Sakai Nakako being shot and killed by U.S. soldier Gerold has not been eliminated, and Japanese college student Miyamura Shoko has been innocently killed by U.S. soldier Tromprey. Aren't the Japanese people investing themselves more and more in the struggle against the U.S. occupiers day by day? Hasn't the cry of "Demand that the U.S. troops get out!" "Demand that the American bastards get out!" been getting louder and more common from Japan to Latin America? U.S. imperialism has established hundreds of military bases all over the world, seemingly powerful, but the foundation of its temporary rampancy is built on volcanoes.

Dreaming of Dominating the World
--The Whole World is United Against U.S. Imperialism

The U.S. imperialism's aggressive policy and war policy have turned into its own noose, also because it is too domineering. It has established military bases all over the world, scattering its troops everywhere, showing the ferocious look of dominating the world, as if everything in the world and the people of the world have to listen to its arrangements. It waves the banner of anti-Soviet and anti-communist, posing as the protector of the "free world" (capitalist world), and piecing together various military groups. When Cuba revolts, it wants to interfere; when Venezuela overthrows the reactionary dictatorial government, it wants to interfere; when Iraq revolts, it wants to send troops to suppress it; when Lebanon has a revolt against Chamoun, it wants to "protect" the "freedom" of small countries; when the Indonesian rebel group wants to overthrow the government, it goes to support it; when Cambodia pursues a neutral policy, it wants to put pressure on it; when the Chinese people severely punish the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen and Matsu islands who harm the country and the people, it also wants to interfere. So, today Venezuela has an incident of the people opposing Nixon, and it mobilizes paratroopers and marines to demonstrate; tomorrow, in order to support the Cuban dictatorial government, it even wants to send troops to interfere in the name of protecting water sources; the day after tomorrow, Iraq has a revolution, and warships and planes are transferred from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The Marines transferred from Okinawa to the Mediterranean Sea have just arrived in the Red Sea, and the sound of the Chinese people punishing the Chiang Kai-shek troops is heard, so they quickly turn around. In order to seize the opportunity to create tension in the Taiwan Strait area, the United States is again transferring warships, planes, and marines from its own country, from the Eastern Pacific, from the Atlantic, and from the Mediterranean. The U.S. fleet's busy parade back and forth at sea is not a sign of U.S. strength, but an exposure of its weakness. There are so many and so scattered military bases, the transportation supply lines are so long, and no matter how many marines, warships, and planes there are, it is never enough. It is really like pressing ten eggs with ten fingers, with no room for loosening at all. This has created the extremely fragile state of U.S. imperialism in strategy. Hundreds of nooses have pulled the necks of the U.S. aggressors too tightly to support. Recently, the U.S. big bourgeoisie newspaper "The Wall Street Journal" asked the government to "reassess" "overseas obligations." This newspaper believes that the current difficulty is: "We have undertaken too many obligations, extended too far," shouldering "obligations" that it cannot fulfill. Although people like Eisenhower and Dulles are still trying to cheer up, bluffing and threatening to "defend" Jinmen and Matsu, and even Nixon says that this time the U.S. is no longer playing the role of a paper tiger, but what magic weapon does the U.S. imperialism, whose mouth is sharp, skin is thick, and stomach is empty, have to prevent the paper tiger from showing its shape once again? This is not something that the subjective wishes of a few rulers in the United States can reverse.

History will eventually develop like this: the more crazy U.S. imperialism is, the more violently it will arouse the resistance of the people of the world, forcing the people of the world to the great struggle to finally eliminate imperialism. U.S. imperialism is bound to be sentenced to death by hanging by the people of the world one day.

    美帝国主义套在自己脖子上的绞索
    陈浚
    在最高国务会议上，毛泽东主席纵论目前国际形势的时候指出：美帝国主义如果坚持推行侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。美国的侵略政策和战争政策，已经给它自己制造了一条条的绞索，并把它们套在自己的脖子上。这些绞索的另一端交给了中国人民、阿拉伯各国人民和全世界一切爱好和平反侵略的人民。毛主席的分析，进一步论证了国际形势所已经发生和继续发展着的东风压倒西风的总趋势，使得全世界人民可以更清晰地透过美帝国主义到处寻衅、到处制造紧张局势的现象，看到美国纸老虎的本质。毛主席对国际形势的分析，也是对于美帝国主义的一次严重警告。
    这篇文章准备通过几件事情的发展情况来讨论一下这个问题。
    同六亿人民为敌
    ——走进了死胡同
    八年以前，美国武装侵占了我国的领土台湾。按照杜勒斯最新的说法，美国侵占台湾，是“由友好政府巩固地掌握西太平洋岛屿锁链（台湾就是其中一部分），对于美国以及太平洋中和太平洋沿岸一切友好国家的切身利益来说，是极其重要的。”而当八年之前，指挥美国军队霸占台湾的麦克阿瑟，曾得意忘形地说：美国认为台湾是“不沉的航空母舰”；“控制”了台湾，美国就可以“用空军控制自海参崴到新加坡的每一亚洲海港”。从美国侵略者的嘴里，不难看到，美国决策者原以为侵占台湾对于实现使“中国消失”和奴役亚洲的计划，是十分有利的。可是八年来，事情的发展，恰恰相反。同六亿中国人民为敌，使美国的远东政策走进了死胡同。
    美国武装侵占我国领土台湾，是发生在美国企图通过蒋介石卖国集团打内战、奴役全中国的侵略计划失败之后，当时，新中国有如旭日东升，万丈光芒，普照东方。不甘心失败的美帝国主义，就再也顾不得什么“朋友”的伪善面具，进行了它在中国内战期间所不敢为的直接武装侵略。美国的新侵略，不能不激起中国人民的义愤，美帝国主义历来用以欺骗中国人民的烟幕，什么美国对中国具有“传统友谊”，什么美国对中国“从无领土野心”等等，一下子烟消云散，在中国人民面前，赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义的原形。美国在发动侵略朝鲜的同时，宣布侵占我国的台湾，是走着日本帝国主义的老路：欲征服亚洲，必先征服中国；欲征服中国，必先征服满蒙；欲征服满蒙，必先征服朝鲜和台湾。中国人民能够纵容美国侵略者循着日本帝国主义的老路，重新奴役中国人民吗？为了独立和自由，为了保卫革命的胜利果实，中国人民空前地团结起来，当美国侵略军直扑我国东北边境的危急时刻，无畏地派出了自己的优秀儿女，抗美援朝，保家卫国。为正义而战的中朝人民胜利了。在同世界上最强大的帝国主义国家的战斗中，新中国不是削弱以至“消失”了，而是更加壮大，屹立于地球之上。这个事实，不能不振奋了亚洲以至全世界一切被压迫的民族，给一切还在苦难中的民族，打开了光明的前景。
    不仅如此。台湾，自古以来就是中国的领土，中国人民有权利行使自己的主权，在适当的时候，用适当的方法，从蒋介石集团手里，解放台湾。这是中国人民不可动摇的意志。美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾，妄想阻挠我国解放自己的领土，并且把它的第七舰队摆在台湾海峡，形成了随时有挑起同中国人民战争的危险局面。这个局面绝不像美国所说的，保护了太平洋和美国的安全，恰恰相反，它成为远东紧张局势的根源。当杜鲁门在1950年6月27日宣布侵占台湾的时候，由于这一侵略行为太露骨了，为了骗人，曾一再声明，侵占台湾是朝鲜战争所引起的“临时措施”。虽则，这个声明是骗人的，但是，也不能不承认，由于有了这个声明，总算还给美国侵略者留着一点脱身的余地。到了朝鲜战争在1953年7月签定了停战协定之后，美国侵占台湾的“临时措施”丧失了根据，于是就在1954年12月，美国同蒋介石卖国集团，又签定了一个所谓“共同防御条约”。这样，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯，就把套在自己脖子上的绞索的活结，打成了死结，“共同防御条约”把美帝国主义同被中国人民所唾弃、苟延残喘于孤岛之上的蒋介石小王朝的命运紧紧拴在一起了。“共同防御条约”是蒋介石出卖台湾的一个条约，对于中国人民来说，是非法的、无效的。但是从这个条约的签订，却又一次使中国人民认识到美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌。
    扩大侵略范围到金马
    ——必将收紧脖子上的绞索
    1955年艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯，又采取了阻挠我国解放金门、马祖等其他沿海岛屿的所谓“使人猜不透的政策”，由美国国会通过了一个联合决议，“授权总统使用美国的武装部队确保和保护像金门和马祖等有关阵地”。目前，美国侵略者正借口这个联合决议，向我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，梦想以“威慑政策”来恫吓中国人民，放弃自己解放沿海岛屿的主权，停止惩办对我沿海地区进行骚扰的蒋介石部队。美帝国主义这种疯狂的挑衅，激起了全国六万万人民反对美国侵略的怒潮。从9月6日到11日的五天时间里，全国各地就有两亿一千二百万人参加了规模空前的大示威。万众一心，要把侵略者从哪里来，就把它们消灭在哪里。而目前，美国所造成的第二次世界大战以后最严重的战争危险局面，也教育和动员了全世界人民，起来反对侵略，保卫和平，使美帝国主义又一次陷在完全孤立的处境。甚至在美国国内，也引起了前所未有的惊恐、不安和对政府的不满，政府现行的政策遭到了尖锐的抨击。
    美国参议员门罗尼说，干涉中国不仅冒风险，而且会招致核报复。
    “基督教科学箴言报”9月10日以“读者抗议远东政策”为题刊载了好几封读者来信。康涅狄格州的詹姆斯·华伯的来信说：“几乎不可想像，在我们的军队还驻在黎巴嫩的时候，我们竟然为了两个小小的沿海岛群而再度濒于同中国发生战争的边缘。这两个岛群显然是属于大陆的。”
    纽约市的诺曼·托马斯来信说：“最糟糕的是那种麻木不仁或听天由命的宿命态度，听凭杜勒斯先生威胁要把我们卷入为了金门而发生的战争中，并且派我们的子弟去为蒋介石送命。”
    美国资产阶级的舆论和不少政界人士，都认为美国对中国的战争挑衅是自寻死路。“纽约先驱论坛报”评论员艾尔索普说：“我们要从已经奇特地陷入的那个角落里逃出来，不是轻而易举的”。“华尔街日报”说：“保卫国民党中国沿海岛屿来对付共产党入侵的做法，远比7月中派遣美国海军陆战队到黎巴嫩去的做法更少得到人民的支持。”那么就老老实实地放弃干涉中国内政和阻挠中国解放金门马祖、把侵略范围扩大到中国沿海岛屿上的打算吧！可是，侵略者又有更大的顾虑。一个叫希金斯的评论员悲伤地吐露了这种心情：“一输起来，要停住是很难很难的。‘纸老虎’在亚洲是没有多大脸面的。”美国前国务卿艾奇逊悲叹说：“现在美国已经失去了对于局势的控制，……美国要么陷入战争，要么退却。政府的态度是这样：在平静的时候不设法使我们从这种情况中脱身出来，而在危机的时候对此毫无办法。”这就是美国垄断资本集团所奉行的侵略政策和战策结下的苦果，就是这样，它把自己制造的绞索套在自争政己的脖子上了！美帝国主义如果不收起它的好战政策，继续与中国人民为敌，那末，六亿中国人民就必然会成为美国侵略者绞刑的执行者。　
    反对阿拉伯人民
    ——一次比一次败得惨
    在美国侵略台湾问题上的情况就是这样，我们再来回顾一下美国侵略黎巴嫩事件。伊拉克人民革命胜利了，美国急急忙忙调兵遣将，登陆黎巴嫩，妄想一举扑灭阿拉伯人民的民族独立运动。可是，它的侵略计划，被以苏联为首的社会主义阵营支持下的阿拉伯人民所揭穿和制住了。但是，美国侵略者侵入黎巴嫩，却给自己套上了另一条绞索。
    如果说，在美国军队登陆以前，黎巴嫩人民所反对的，不过是一个夏蒙，起义部队的共同目标，仅仅是要求夏蒙下台。美国派遣军队进行武装干涉的结果呢？不是夏蒙更加坐稳了总统的宝座，而是全黎巴嫩的人民在美帝国主义的坦克、大炮面前，更加坚强地团结起来了；在起义部队的纲领中，增加了要求美军撤退，保卫国家独立和自由的目标。在全世界人民面前，一个一贯打着联合国招牌掩护侵略，一个一贯用什么“艾森豪威尔主义”把自己打扮成阿拉伯人民“朋友”的美国强盗，这一次把血淋淋的凶手伸出来了。谁都记得，在美国发动侵朝战争的时候，曾经借着联合国的幌子，纠集了十六国组成侵略军队，并且当时美国的表决机器，在联合国还能起点作用，通过了污蔑中国人民和朝鲜人民的决议；在埃及收回苏伊士运河主权，遭到英法侵略的时候，美国也曾装作主持“公正”的外貌，却从英法手里找到了“真空地带”，在英法侵略中东遭到失败之后，美国帝国主义就打出“艾森豪威尔主义”的旗帜，去“填补真空”了。可是在伊拉克革命爆发，一个早上使得美国在中东侵略的基石倾塌的时候，假冒为善的“艾森豪威尔主义”彻底破产了。于是美国就全武行地登台了。美国的侵略，不仅教育了阿拉伯人民，并且又一次教育了全世界人民。正义的谴责来自全世界，迫使美国不能不接受苏联的召开联合国大会紧急特别会议的建议。这次会上，纵然有艾森豪威尔亲自出马，企图洗脱侵略者的罪行，妄想再一次取得联合国的幌子，使自己的侵略罪行合法化。但是，事情的发展却朝着相反的方向，结果是美国大失所望。联合国的表决机器已不再是美国的如意算盘了。大会通过了实际上谴责美英侵略，要求美英撤军的阿拉伯国家提案。现在美国还在拖延从黎巴嫩撤兵，可是黎巴嫩人民已经向美国侵略者发出了警告，如果美军不撤退，将享以铁拳！不难预见：美国军队在黎巴嫩呆得越久，黎巴嫩以至阿拉伯人民的反抗将越加坚决，美国自己已经套上的这条绞索也将拉得越紧。
    到处建立军事基地
    ——到处都是火山
    在台湾问题上是如此，在美国侵占黎巴嫩问题上是如此，在南朝鲜、在日本、在美国到处建立的军事基地的情况，何尝不是如此呢！在所有美国军队占领的地方，都不能不引起被占领土地上的一切爱好自由和独立的人民的反对。这种反对，并且必将随着美国军队占领时间的延长而日益增长。试问，有哪一个有自尊心的民族，能够容忍美国侵略者在自己国土上横行霸道、任意杀人、奸淫掳掠吗？日本农妇坂井奈加子被美国兵哲腊德枪杀的旧恨未消，日本大学生宫村祥之又无辜地死在美国兵朗普雷的枪下。日本人民不是一天比一天更多地投入了反对美国占领者的斗争中去了吗？“要求美军滚出去！”“要求美国佬滚出去！”的呼声，不是从日本到拉丁美洲，越来越响，越来越普遍了吗？美帝国主义在全世界建立了几百个军事基地，貌似强大，可是他的暂时的猖獗的基础都是建立在火山上的。
    好梦独霸全世界
    ——全世界同仇敌忾反美帝
    美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，所以变成了自己的绞索，还因为它太霸道了。在全世界都建立了军事基地，到处撒着它的军队，摆出独霸世界的凶相，似乎全世界的事情，全世界的人民都得听他摆布。它打着反苏反共的旗号，俨然以“自由世界”（资本主义世界）的保护者自居，拼凑各种各样的军事集团。古巴起义，它要干涉；委内瑞拉推翻了反动的独裁政府，它要干涉；伊拉克革命，它要派兵镇压；黎巴嫩发生了反对夏蒙的起义，它又要去“保护”小国的“自由”；印度尼西亚叛乱集团要推翻政府，它去支持；柬埔寨奉行中立政策，它要施加压力；中国人民严惩金门马祖岛上祸国殃民的蒋介石部队，它也要干涉。于是，今天委内瑞拉发生人民反对尼克松的事件，它就调动伞兵和海军陆战队去示威；明天，为了支持古巴的独裁政府，它竟借保护水源为名要派兵去干涉；后天，伊拉克革命了，就从大西洋、太平洋，把军舰、飞机纷纷调去；从冲绳岛调往地中海的海军陆战队刚到了红海，中国人民惩办蒋介石部队的炮声响了，于是，赶快掉过头来；美国为了抓紧机会，制造台湾海峡地区的紧张局势，又把军舰、飞机、海军陆战队，从本国、从东太平洋、从大西洋、从地中海又调过来了。美国舰队这样忙忙碌碌地在海上来回举行大游行，并非美国强大的表现，而是暴露了它的虚弱。军事基地那么多又那么分散，交通供应线拉得那么长，再有多少海军陆战队、军舰和飞机，也永远是不够的。真是十个指头按住了十个鸡蛋，一点松动的余地没有了。这就造成了美帝国主义战略上极度脆弱的现状。几百条绞索把美国侵略者的脖子拉得过分紧张，难于支持下去了。最近美国大资产阶级的报纸“华尔街日报”就要求政府“重新估价”“海外义务”，这家报纸认为现在的困难是：“我们承担的义务过多，延伸得太远”，担负了力不胜任的“义务”。虽则像艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之流，还在强自振作，虚张声势，叫嚣要“保卫”金门、马祖，甚至尼克松说，这回美国再不是在扮演纸老虎的角色了，但是，嘴尖皮厚腹中已空了的美帝国主义，又有什么灵丹妙药使纸老虎不再一次显形呢？这不是美国少数统治者的主观愿望所能挽回的。
    历史终将这样发展下去：美帝国主义越疯狂，它就越会更猛烈地激起全世界人民的反抗，把全世界人民逼上最后消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争中去。美帝国主义势必有一天，要被全世界人民处以绞刑。
