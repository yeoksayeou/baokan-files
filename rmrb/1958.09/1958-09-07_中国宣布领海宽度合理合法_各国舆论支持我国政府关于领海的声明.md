Xinhua News Agency, September 6th. The "Izvestia" published today an article by Nikolayev entitled "The Sovereignty of the People's Republic of China."

　　The article said that this statement is completely legal and fully in line with China's economic and defense interests, and it does not harm the interests of any other country. Undoubtedly, the Chinese government's statement on China's territorial sea will be supported by other countries. This statement has been fully understood by the Soviet public.

　　The article said that the stipulation in the statement that the breadth of the territorial sea is twelve nautical miles applies to all Chinese territory, and this decision is completely in line with the actual situation of established international law. The Soviet Union had already made proposals on the issue of the breadth of the territorial sea at the Conference on the Law of the Sea held in Geneva from February 24 to April 29 this year. At that time, the Soviet Union suggested that each country should determine the breadth of its territorial sea in accordance with the established actual situation, that is, usually from three to twelve nautical miles. This is because of historical and geographical conditions, the economic and security interests of the country, and the interests of international navigation.

　　The Soviet proposal was supported by socialist countries and countries such as the United Arab Republic, Burma, India, and Nepal, but the United States, Britain, and other countries, regardless of the vital interests and security of other countries' sovereignty, tried their best to determine the breadth of the territorial seas of various countries very narrowly.

　　The article finally said that the provisions in our statement that the waters within the baseline are China's internal seas, that the islands within the baseline are China's internal sea islands, and that all foreign aircraft and military vessels shall not enter China's territorial sea and territorial airspace without the permission of the Chinese government are also fully in line with international law and the actual situation of various countries.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 6th. Today's "Red Right Newspaper" commented on the Chinese government's recent statement on China's territorial sea, pointing out that China has the inalienable right to determine its territorial sea and its breadth. The newspaper emphasized that China made this decision following the example of many coastal countries, and its decision must be fully respected.

　　The "People's Defense Newspaper" commented that after the Chinese government made this decision, any intervention by the United States to support the Chiang Kai-shek group will be regarded as an act of aggression by the United States against China and will be condemned by world opinion. The commentary mentioned the statement made by Dulles after consulting with Eisenhower recently, saying that this statement clearly proves the United States' aggressive intentions towards the People's Republic of China.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 6th. Ulrich Mackosch, a commentator for Democratic Germany's Deutsche Radio, published a commentary on the Chinese government's statement on the territorial sea on the 5th. The commentary pointed out that China's declaration of its territorial sea width as twelve nautical miles is reasonable.

　　The commentary said that determining the width of one's own territorial sea falls within the scope of each country's own consideration. For example, some Latin American countries have long stipulated that their territorial sea width is eighty nautical miles.

　　The commentary also condemned the United States' interference in China's internal affairs and provocative behavior in creating tension in the Taiwan region.

　　The commentary said that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles actually issued a statement on the 4th, saying that the People's Republic of China's use of "force" (here he refers to China's announcement that its territorial sea width is twelve nautical miles) "will cause a problem that goes far beyond...the scope of Taiwan's security." This U.S. Secretary of State actually talked about how "the civilized world will never forgive blatant military conquest as a legitimate policy tool." However, the people of Asia are asking today: Who is using force there? Who is using force to interfere in China's internal affairs? It is precisely the United States itself. In fact, it is precisely Dulles himself. The U.S. ruling clique has been creating tension in the Taiwan region these days together with its running dog Chiang Kai-shek. This is of course intolerable to the People's Republic of China.

　　"Neues Deutschland" said in an editorial entitled "A Line Drawn for Dulles" that the Chinese government's statement on the scope of the territorial sea is a major step taken to stabilize the coastal areas of China. It drives the provocateurs beyond a certain line, thereby contributing to the consolidation of security and peace. Today, only a few countries retain a three-nautical-mile zone, and some Latin American countries even have territorial seas of no less than two hundred nautical miles. Can't a great China with 650 million people use this indisputable right? China, which has often been the victim of imperialist aggression in the past, is now strong enough to defend its rights, and it has the support of powerful friends.

　　The editorial concluded by saying that although Dulles is still putting on airs and making shameless threats in Washington, he will not be able to prevent China from obtaining its territory, which is now and always has been its own.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 6th. The Mongolian "Truth" published an editorial today entitled "People All Over the World Support the Just Struggle of the Chinese People," condemning the provocative actions of U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait. The editorial said that the Mongolian people, together with the people of the world, fully support the September 4th statement of the government of the People's Republic of China regarding the territorial sea.

　　The editorial emphasized that imperialism's provocation against China is a provocation against the socialist camp. The editorial finally warned the U.S. imperialists that if you do not immediately stop your provocations against the Chinese people and are unwilling to give up your attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs, then your situation will be even more terrible than your past failures.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, September 6th. "Free Romania" published a commentary on the 6th supporting our country's statement on the territorial sea.

　　The commentary said that U.S. imperialism should restrain its emotions a little on the issue of the territorial sea boundary of the People's Republic of China. Why is the United States so furious about the government of the People's Republic of China expanding its territorial sea to twelve nautical miles? This is because it dreams of annexing all of China's territory. The commentary warned the delirious U.S. ruling clique, "Quickly take back your bloody hand that is invading the people of China! Otherwise, the people will cut off your claws."

　　A recent issue of "Literary Gazette" also published a commentary condemning U.S. imperialism for creating tension in the Taiwan region. The commentary pointed out that Taiwan, Jinmen, and Matsu are all islands of the People's China. No force in the world can stop the Chinese people from liberating these islands.

### 中国宣布领海宽度合理合法  各国舆论支持我国政府关于领海的声明

　　中国宣布领海宽度合理合法
　　各国舆论支持我国政府关于领海的声明
    新华社6日讯　“消息报”今天刊登了尼古拉耶夫写的以“中华人民共和国的主权”为题的一篇文章。
    文章说，这一声明完全合法，完全符合中国的经济和国防利益，它并没有妨害其他任何国家的利益。无疑，中国政府关于中国领海的声明一定会得到其他国家的支持。这一声明获得了苏联公众的充分了解。
    文章说，声明中所指出的领海宽度为十二浬的规定适用于中国的一切领土，这一决定完全符合已经形成的国际法的实际情况。苏联在今年2月24日到4月29日在日内瓦举行的海洋法会议上，就已经对领海宽度问题提出过建议。当时苏联建议每个国家确定本国领海宽度时要符合已经形成的实际情况，即照例是从三到十二浬。这是因为考虑到历史、地理条件、国家的经济利益和安全利益和国际航海的利益。
    苏联的建议曾受到社会主义各国和阿拉伯联合共和国、缅甸、印度和尼泊尔等国家的支持，但美英等国不顾他国主权切身利益和安全，极力企图把各国领海宽度确定得很狭窄。
    文章最后说，我国声明内关于在基线以内的水域都是中国的内海，在基线内的岛屿都是中国的内海岛屿以及关于一切外国飞机和军用船舶未经中国政府许可不得进入中国的领海和领海上空等规定，也完全符合国际法和各国的实际情况。
    新华社布拉格6日电　今天的“红色权利报”评论中国政府最近关于中国领海的声明时指出，中国有决定它的领海及其宽度的不容剥夺的权利。该报强调说，中国作出这种决定是仿照许多滨海国家的例子，它的决定必须充分地予以尊重。
    “人民防线报”的评论强调说，在中国政府作出了这个决定之后，美国为了支持蒋介石集团而进行的任何干涉都将被视为美国对中国的侵略行动，并将遭到世界舆论的谴责。评论谈到最近杜勒斯在和艾森豪威尔会商之后发表的声明时说，这个声明明显地证明了美国对中华人民共和国的侵略目的。
    据新华社柏林电　民主德国的德意志广播电台评论员乌尔里希·马科施5日发表评论，评中国政府关于领海的声明。评论指出，中国宣布它的领海宽度为十二海里是合理的。
    评论说，确定自己的领海宽度，这属于每一个国家自己考虑的范围，例如拉丁美洲一些国家早就规定它们的领海宽度为八十海里。
    评论还谴责美国干涉中国内部事务、在台湾地区制造紧张局势的挑衅行为。
    评论说，美国国务卿杜勒斯居然在4日发表声明说，中华人民共和国使用“武力”（这里他指的是中国宣布它的领海宽度为十二海里这件事）“将引起一个远远超过……台湾安全的这些范围以外的问题”。这位美国国务卿居然侈谈什么“文明世界决不会把公然的军事征服宽恕成为合法的政策工具”。可是，亚洲的人们今天都在问：是谁在那里使用了武力？是谁用武力干涉了中国的内政？恰恰就是美国自己。其实，恰恰就是杜勒斯自己。美国统治集团这些天来正在和他的走狗蒋介石一起在台湾地区制造紧张局势。这当然是中华人民共和国所不能容忍的。
      “新德意志报”在题为“给杜勒斯定的界线”的社论中说，中国政府关于领海范围的声明是为稳定中国沿海地区所做出的重大步骤，它把挑衅者赶到了一定的界线以外从而为安全和和平的巩固作出了贡献。今天只有很少的国家保留着三海里区，一些拉丁美洲的国家甚至保有着不下于二百海里的领海，难道拥有六亿五千万人口的巨大的中国反倒不能够使用这一不可争辩的权利吗？过去经常成为帝国主义者进犯的牺牲者的中国，今天已经强大得足够保卫它的权利，而且它还有强大的朋友的支持。
    社论最后说，尽管杜勒斯还在装模作样并且在华盛顿发表无耻的恫吓，可是他将不能够阻止中国去获得它的现在是而且一向就是属于它的领土。
    据新华社乌兰巴托6日电　蒙古“真理报”今天发表题为“全世界人民支持中国人民的正义斗争”的社论，谴责美帝国主义在台湾海峡的挑衅行为。社论说，蒙古人民同全世界人民一道，完全支持中华人民共和国政府9月4日发表的关于领海声明。
    社论强调说，帝国主义对中国的挑衅就是对社会主义阵营的挑衅。社论最后警告美帝国主义者说，如果你们不立即停止对中国人民的挑衅，不甘心放弃干涉中国内政的企图，那么，你们的处境将比过去的失败还要可怕。
    新华社布加勒斯特6日电　“自由罗马尼亚报”6日发表评论支持我国关于领海的声明。
    评论说，在中华人民共和国的领海界线问题上美帝国主义应该抑制一点自己的感情。美国为什么对中华人民共和国政府把领海扩大到十二海里那么狂怒呢？这是因为它梦想着吞并中国的全部领土。评论警告热昏了头脑的美国统治集团说，“赶快拿回你侵略人民中国的血腥的手吧！不然人民是会斩断你的魔爪的”。
    最近一期“文学周报”也发表了评论，谴责美帝国主义在台湾地区制造紧张局势。评论指出，台湾、金门、马祖都是人民中国的岛屿。世界上没有任何力量能够阻止中国人民对这些岛屿的解放。
