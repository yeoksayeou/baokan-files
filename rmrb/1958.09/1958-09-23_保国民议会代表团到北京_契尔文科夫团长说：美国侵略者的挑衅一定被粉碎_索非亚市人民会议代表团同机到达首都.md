Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: The Bulgarian National Assembly delegation, headed by Comrade Chervenkov, and the Sofia City People's Congress delegation, headed by Comrade Kostov, arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon from Moscow. The honored guests brought the profound friendship of the Bulgarian people and their warm support for the Chinese people's just struggle against American military provocations.

In a written speech delivered at the airport (full text on page 3), Comrade Chervenkov said, "We are visiting China at a time when the American imperialists and their running dogs, Chiang Kai-shek, are carrying out shameless provocations in the Taiwan Strait, threatening world peace. I would like to express here that the Bulgarian people fully support the just cause of the People's Republic of China, which will surely triumph, the sinister schemes of the enemies of peace will surely be crushed, and the East Wind will surely prevail over the West Wind."

Today, the national flags of China and Bulgaria flew in the wind at Beijing Airport. Our national leaders and people from all walks of life in the capital warmly welcomed the honored guests despite the rain. When the distinguished guests stepped off the plane, the welcoming crowd, soaked by the rain, immediately cheered. Young women from the capital rushed forward to present flowers to the guests. Cheers and applause drowned out the sound of the rain. The entire airport was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere of joy.

Vice Chairman Lin Boqu expressed a warm welcome to the honored guests on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chinese people. In his written welcoming speech (full text on page 3), he said, "Such friendly mutual visits between the parliaments, governments, and peoples of our two countries not only further consolidate and develop the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Bulgaria, but also contribute to strengthening the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and upholding the noble cause of world peace."

Also present at the airport today to welcome the honored guests were Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong; Vice Premiers Peng Dehuai and Nie Rongzhen; Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei; responsible persons from various departments of our national government, people's organizations, and democratic parties; as well as the Bulgarian Ambassador to China, Panchevsky, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China.

Finally, as the distinguished guests circled the airport to meet the welcoming masses, Comrade Chervenkov repeatedly stepped into the ranks of the welcoming crowd, warmly shaking hands with young men and women in the capital. The applause and cheers rang out for a long time, and the slogan "Long live the brotherly friendship between China and Bulgaria" once again reverberated throughout the airport.
