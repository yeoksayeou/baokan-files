Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 23rd: Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, in answering questions from West German writer and journalist John, said that the most direct path to consolidating peace in Europe is cooperation and friendship between the Soviet people and all the people of Germany.

Khrushchev answered several questions concerning relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. Khrushchev emphasized that while the Soviet government is strengthening fraternal friendship with the German Democratic Republic, it is also establishing relations with the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of peaceful cooperation, and striving to imbue these relations with a spirit of mutual trust and friendship, which is in the interests of both the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. He said that any suggestion aimed at improving West German relations with the Soviet Union would be welcomed by Moscow.

Khrushchev pointed out that the policies of the West German government do not follow the principles of peaceful coexistence. It does not miss any opportunity to demonstrate its loyalty to the "Atlantic Alliance." Its practical activities frequently erupt in blind hostility towards socialist countries. Speeches by the most responsible figures in West Germany are filled with crude and intolerable attacks on the Soviet Union. Khrushchev said that these people are doing everything possible to hinder the development of relations between the two countries.

Referring to the recent meeting between Chancellor Adenauer and French Premier de Gaulle, Khrushchev emphasized that just as France was resolving the question of its very existence as a republic, the West German government felt it was opportune to express its close cooperation with the French government, which can only have one purpose: to encourage and instigate reactionary forces in France to carry out anti-democratic changes.

As some newspapers have spoken of the possibility of establishing a "Bonn-Paris axis," Khrushchev said: We still remember Hitler's meeting with Mussolini in 1934, which led to the collusion of two dictators against the democratic freedom of the European people and against the interests of peace. Khrushchev warned that those who now want to raise the tattered and torn banner of anti-communism again should not forget the disastrous defeats suffered not long ago by all kinds of anti-communist "axes" and "triangles."

Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet Union and West Germany are both highly developed countries, and they can engage in more extensive trade.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union can only complete its grand plans for developing the national economy smoothly and on schedule under conditions of safeguarding world peace. Of course, the Soviet government's desire to maintain peace is not for propaganda purposes. Peace is a vital need for the Soviet Union.

John asked Khrushchev how the Soviet Union would react if West Germany abandoned its policy of equipping the Bundeswehr with nuclear weapons and limited the number of personnel and equipment of the Bundeswehr to a level that would convincingly demonstrate that it was solely for defense purposes. Khrushchev replied that this would be a very meaningful act of peace, which would help the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany to engage in close cooperation on the basis of trust and friendship. Such measures would have a beneficial effect on the situation in Europe, moving it in the direction of eliminating the tensions that exist in the region. Doing so would also give a powerful impetus to the cause of restoring German unity.

    赫鲁晓夫答西德记者问
    想举起反共破旗的人勿忘历史教训
    建立“波恩—巴黎轴心”的企图不会有好结果
    新华社24日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科23日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在回答西德作家和记者约翰提出的问题时说，巩固欧洲和平的最近的道路是苏联人民同德国全体人民之间的合作和友谊。
    赫鲁晓夫回答了有关苏联同德意志联邦共和国关系中的许多问题。赫鲁晓夫强调说，苏联政府在加强苏联同德意志民主共和国的兄弟友谊的同时，也在和平合作的基础上同德意志联邦共和国建立关系，并且努力使这种关系贯穿着互相信任和友好的精神，这样既符合苏联的利益，也符合德意志联邦共和国的利益。他说，任何旨在改善西德同苏联关系的建议都将受到莫斯科的欢迎。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，西德政府的政策没有遵循着和平共处的原则。它不放过任何机会来表明它对“大西洋国家联盟”的忠心。在它的实际活动中经常爆发对社会主义国家的盲目的敌意。西德最负责的人士的讲话充满对苏联的粗暴和不能容许的攻击。赫鲁晓夫说，这些人正在千方百计地阻挠两国间关系的发展。
    在谈到不久前阿登纳总理同法国总理戴高乐的会见时，赫鲁晓夫强调指出，正当法国在解决共和国存在与否的问题时，西德政府认为表示同法国政府建立密切的合作是适合时宜的，那末这只能有一个目的，就是怂恿和唆使法国反动势力进行反民主的变革。
    由于某些国家报刊谈到可能建立起一个“波恩—巴黎轴心”的问题，赫鲁晓夫说：我们还记得1934年希特勒同墨索里尼的会见，那次会见使两个独裁者勾结起来反对欧洲人民的民主自由，反对和平的利益。赫鲁晓夫警告说，那些现在想要重新举起反对共产主义的千疮百孔的破旗进行活动的人，不应当忘记不久以前形形色色的反共“轴心”和“三角联盟”所遭到的惨败。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，苏联和西德都是高度发达的国家，它们之间可以进行规模更广泛的贸易。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联只有在捍卫世界和平的条件下才能按期顺利地完成发展国民经济的宏伟计划。当然，苏联政府维护和平的愿望不是出于宣传。和平是苏联的切身需要。
    约翰问赫鲁晓夫，如果西德放弃原子武装联邦国防军的做法，并且把国防军的人数和装备限制在使人确信完全是国防任务所需的水平的时候，苏联将如何对待。赫鲁晓夫回答说，这将是一个很有意义的和平举动，它有助于苏联同德意志联邦共和国在信任和友好的基础上进行紧密合作。这种措施会对欧洲局势起有利的影响，使它向着消除现存于这个地区的紧张局势的方向发展。这样做并将给恢复德国统一的事业以有力的推动。
