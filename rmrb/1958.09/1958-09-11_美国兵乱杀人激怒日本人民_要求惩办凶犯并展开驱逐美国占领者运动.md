Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The incident of American soldier Rumpel randomly firing at a moving tram and killing Japanese university student Shoji Miyamura has aroused strong anger among the Japanese people.

Shiga Yoshio, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, stated in today's "Akahata" that the fundamental reason for this incident is that the United States has set up military bases in Japan, armed itself with the occupation of Japan and ruled the Japanese people. He said that in order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, the Japanese people must further strengthen the movement to demand that the United States withdraw its military bases in Japan and withdraw its troops from Japan.

Shiga pointed out that only when the Japanese people unite and launch a strong protest movement can the incident of American soldiers shooting and killing people be truly resolved. He said that the Japanese people must demand that the Japanese judicial authorities stand on the side of the Japanese people to try the American murderer Rumpel.

Shiga called on Japanese democratic groups and the people to immediately launch a large-scale protest movement.

Yesterday, Akikubo and Nishimura, the vice-chairmen of the Japanese Socialist Party's Military Base Countermeasures Committee, together with a survey team from the Socialist Party's Saitama Prefecture Federation investigating the incident of American soldiers shooting and killing a Japanese university student, went to Johnson Air Base to investigate the scene where Rumpel shot and killed Shoji Miyamura. Subsequently, they met with US military base commander Bandyber and handed him a letter of protest. The letter of protest pointed out that this incident shows that the US military authorities have not reflected on the "Gerard Incident" that occurred last time. Representatives of organizations such as the Saitama prefectural organizations of the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party, the Johnson Air Base branch of the All-Japan Garrison Forces Labor Union, and the Saitama Prefectural Countermeasures Committee against Missile Bases, went to Johnson Air Base on the 9th to lodge serious protests with the US military authorities and demanded that the culprit Rumpel be handed over to the Japanese authorities.

The day before, the joint struggle conference against the "Performance Rating" system in Kawagoe City, where Rumpel committed the crime, also held a meeting and decided to launch a broad protest movement regarding this incident.

The All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations issued a statement on the 8th, strongly protesting the US military authorities' protection of the murderer Rumpel and demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government take resolute measures to thoroughly investigate the crimes of the American murderer.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: Japanese Justice Minister Aichi Kiichi said at a Cabinet meeting today that the case of American soldier Peter Rumpel shooting and killing Japanese university student Shoji Miyamura on the 7th without cause should be tried by a Japanese court. He said that Rumpel's killing was not in the performance of his duties.

Currently, Japan and the United States are conducting investigations into this case. However, according to the Japanese police authorities, the US side does not allow the Japanese police authorities to conduct a full investigation until the US side completes its "investigation". Japanese judicial personnel who are negotiating with the US side on this case said that Rumpel's shooting of a Japanese university student this time has nothing to do with his performance of duties, so this case should be tried by a Japanese court.

Shoji Miyamura's mother has already rushed from Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu to Musashino Music University northwest of Tokyo to see her tragically deceased only son.

    美国兵乱杀人激怒日本人民
    要求惩办凶犯并展开驱逐美国占领者运动
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：美国兵朗普雷无故向正在行驶中的电车开枪而打死日本大学生宫村祥之的事件，激起了日本人民的强烈愤怒。
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员志贺义雄今天在“赤旗报”上发表谈话指出，美国在日本境内设置军事基地、武装霸占日本和统治日本人民，是发生这次事件的根本原因。他说，为了使今后不再发生类似事件，日本人民必须进一步加强要求美国撤销它在日本的军事基地和从日本撤出它的军队的运动。
    志贺指出，只有日本人民团结起来展开强烈的抗议运动，才能真正解决这次美国兵开枪杀人的事件。他说，日本人民必须要求日本司法当局站在日本人民的立场上来对美国杀人犯朗普雷进行审判。
    志贺号召日本各民主团体和人民立即展开大规模的抗议运动。
    昨天，日本社会党军事基地对策委员会副委员长茜久保和西村两人会同社会党埼玉县联合会调查美国兵开枪打死日本大学生事件的调查团一道到约翰逊基地，调查了朗普雷开枪打死宫村祥之的现场情况。随后，他们会见了美军基地司令班代伯，向他递交了抗议书。抗议书指出，这次事件表明，美军当局没有就上次发生的“哲腊德事件”进行反省。日本共产党和社会党的埼玉县地方组织、全驻留军工会约翰逊基地分会、反对导弹基地埼玉县对策委员会等组织的代表，在9日分别到约翰逊基地对美军当局提出严重抗议，并且要求把凶犯朗普雷交给日本当局。
    在这前一天，朗普雷肇事地川越市的反对“勤务评定”制度共同斗争会议也举行了会议，决定就这一事件展开广泛的抗议运动。
    全日本学生自治会总联合会曾经在8日发表声明，严重抗议美军当局袒护杀人犯朗普雷，并且要求岸信介政府采取坚决措施，彻底追究美国杀人凶犯的罪行。
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本法务相爱知揆一今天在内阁会议上说，美国兵彼得·朗普雷在7日无故枪杀日本大学生宫村祥之的案件，应该交由日本法庭审判。他说，朗普雷杀人并非出于执行勤务。
    目前，日美双方正在就这个案件进行调查。但是，据日本警察当局说，在美方完成“调查”以前，美方不允许日本警察当局进行充分调查。同美方就这一案件进行交涉的日方司法人员说，朗普雷这次枪杀日本大学生同他执行勤务毫无关系，因此，这个案件应当由日本法庭来审理。
    宫村祥之的母亲今天已经从九州熊本县赶到东京西北的武藏野音乐大学来看她的惨死的独生子。
