Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd – People from all walks of life in Shandong Province and Jinan City have held meetings and issued statements one after another, supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and warning the American aggressors to get out of Taiwan.

The vast number of workers fighting on the iron and steel front have denounced the war cries of American imperialism and are determined to crush the war provocations of the American aggressors with practical actions. Shang Yuntai, an old worker at Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, said angrily, "The American imperialists claim to be negotiating with us, while at the same time amassing troops and engaging in war provocations. Isn't this simply playing the rogue?" All the employees of the factory unanimously expressed their determination to produce more iron and steel to severely strike at the American aggressors.

Licheng County farmers, who are actively striving for an autumn harvest and preparing for an even greater harvest next year, were extremely angry at Dulles' absurd remarks after reading Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement in the newspaper. After collectively reading Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, Kong Qingcai, Yan Zhenhua, and more than a dozen other members of the Second Battalion of the Beiyuan People's Commune unanimously expressed their determination to strengthen autumn field management and strive for a bumper autumn harvest. They pledged to support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and protest against American military provocations and war threats with the practical action of ensuring the realization of the "satellite" field target of 50,000 jin of rice, 5 million jin of cabbage and radishes, and 30,000 jin of lotus roots per mu.

Yesterday, democratic parties and non-party democratic figures in Shandong Province and Jinan City held a symposium on Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and unanimously adopted a joint statement supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and opposing American military provocations. Heads of various people's organizations in the province issued written statements supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 23rd – People from all walks of life in Hefei City have held meetings one after another, warmly supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, denouncing Dulles' shameless and distorted lies, and expressing their firm determination to fight to the end to recover Jinmen, Mazu, and liberate Taiwan and the Penghu Islands with practical actions.

More than 3,000 workers at the Hefei Mining Machinery Factory held meetings next to machines and in the dining hall. Jin Zhongyi, a worker in the Communist Youth League section of the metalworking workshop, said, "Taiwan, Jinmen, and Mazu have been Chinese territory since ancient times. This is a fact recognized by people all over the world, and even the United States itself has admitted it. American imperialism has invaded our country and has recently engaged in military provocations in these areas, while Dulles has falsely accused our country of being an 'aggressor' and proposed the so-called 'ceasefire.' It is truly absurd." Tao Xingsheng, an old worker in the foundry workshop, said: "We want to warn American imperialism: today's China is no longer the China of the past. If the American aggressors do not honestly withdraw from Taiwan, we will certainly make them come alive and go back dead."

The local organizations of various democratic parties in Anhui Province jointly held a meeting on the evening of the 21st, unanimously expressing their support for Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 23rd – Factories, schools, government offices, residents, democratic parties and people's organizations, and People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Nanchang City have held meetings one after another, warning the American aggressors to immediately stop military provocations and withdraw their armed forces from the Taiwan Strait.

Officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanchang City are determined to raise their vigilance, improve their skills, and make full preparations to liberate our country's territory of Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan, and to smash the armed aggression of American imperialism. Liu Tianxun and other soldiers whose terms of service are about to expire resolutely requested the organization to approve their extension of their terms of service and be prepared to strike at American imperialism at any time. All employees of the Jiangxi Tractor Factory unanimously expressed their determination to manufacture a large number of smelting equipment with greater enthusiasm to support iron and steel production and support the liberation of Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan. At the meeting of the militia battalion of the Yangzizhou People's Commune in the suburbs of Nanchang City, they unanimously expressed their warm support for Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, and they guaranteed that they would achieve this year's vegetable yield of 600,000 jin per mu. Members of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee and Nanchang Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, representatives of various democratic parties in Nanchang City, and people from all walks of life held a joint emergency meeting yesterday, supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, and passed a resolution supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement.

    山东　合肥　南昌
    各界人民奋起反对美国侵略
    新华社济南23日电　山东省和济南市各界人民纷纷集会和发表谈话，拥护陈毅外长声明，警告美国侵略者必须滚出台湾。
    战斗在钢铁阵地上的广大工人，纷纷痛斥美帝国主义的战争叫嚣，决以实际行动粉碎美国侵略者的战争挑衅。济南第一机床厂老工人尚运太气愤地说，美帝国主义一面声称和我们谈判，一面又集结兵力进行战争挑衅，这不明明是耍无赖吗？这个厂全体职工一致表示要多炼钢铁，狠狠打击美国侵略者。
    正在积极争取秋季丰收，并为明年更大丰收作准备的历城县农民，从报纸上看到陈毅外长的声明后，对杜勒斯的荒谬言论万分愤怒。北园人民公社二营社员孔庆才、阎振华等十余人集体阅读了陈外长的声明后，一致表示要加强秋田管理，争取秋季大丰收，要以确保“卫星”田亩产五万斤稻子、五百万斤白菜、萝卜和三万斤藕的指标实现的实际行动来拥护陈外长声明，抗议美国的军事挑衅和战争威胁。
    昨天，山东省和济南市各民主党派和无党派民主人士集会座谈了陈外长的声明，并一致通过了关于拥护陈外长的声明和反对美国军事挑衅的联合声明。省各人民团体的负责人分别发表了拥护陈外长声明的书面谈话。

    各民主党派安徽省地方组织21日晚联合举行集会，一致表示拥护陈外长的声明。
