Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd dispatch from New York: According to TASS, at the United Nations General Assembly's plenary session on the afternoon of the 22nd, the issue of including the question of China's representation in the United Nations on the agenda was discussed. The fact that representatives from twenty-three countries have requested to speak on this issue once again demonstrates its immense significance.

Before the Assembly were the U.S. proposal, passed by the General Committee (under U.S. manipulation) stating that the issue of Chinese representation should not be discussed at this session, and the seven-nation amendment (Afghanistan, Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, Nepal, and the United Arab Republic) to the U.S. proposal. This amendment fundamentally altered the U.S. proposal by requesting that the General Assembly discuss the issue of Chinese representation at this session.

Indian delegation leader Menon was the first to speak at the meeting. He pointed out that the General Committee's adoption of the U.S. proposal exceeded its authority, violated the United Nations Charter, and contravened previous resolutions of the Assembly.

Menon emphasized that the events currently unfolding in the Far East necessitate resolving this issue. Restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations represents the demand of many United Nations member states, representing the majority of humanity. Therefore, the Assembly cannot ignore the opinions of these countries and fail to include this issue on the Assembly's agenda, as these countries believe that discussing this issue is extremely important and urgent.

U.S. representative Lodge opposed the Asian-African seven-nation amendment, offering no other reason to support the U.S. proposal other than pointing out that the Assembly had passed similar resolutions in previous sessions.

Subsequently, Soviet delegation leader Gromyko spoke. Gromyko pointed out that the only reason China is not in the United Nations is the hostile policy pursued by the U.S. government towards the Chinese people and their government. He asked, when will the United Nations cease allowing itself to be used as a tool of American policy?

Gromyko noted that the British government has been playing a double game for years, opposing the People's Republic of China's representatives from occupying their legitimate seat in the United Nations, and bears no small responsibility for the situation in the United Nations regarding the issue of Chinese representation. Gromyko continued that most of the countries supporting the U.S. position on the issue of Chinese representation do so only because of American pressure.

Gromyko concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation unreservedly supports the Indian delegation's suggestion to restore China's legitimate representation in the United Nations.

U.S. representative Lodge spoke again, futilely denying the fact pointed out by Gromyko that the U.S. was putting pressure on other countries’ delegations to prevent the restoration of the People's Republic of China's seat. Lodge also used the opportunity to viciously slander the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.

Bulgarian Foreign Minister Lukanov pointed out that the United States is clearly afraid of discussing the issue of restoring China's rights in the United Nations because it cannot defend its policy on this issue. Even America's allies refuse to support it.

Swedish representative Rosell requested that the Assembly discuss the issue of China's representation in the United Nations, saying that the Swedish government considers this issue to be extremely important. He said that this abnormal phenomenon should end, where a handful of people from the island of Taiwan are performing the functions of a major country in the organs of the United Nations, while the People's Republic of China is excluded from this organization. No argument can convince us that this situation is tolerable, or that major international issues, primarily disarmament, can be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China.

Finnish representative Enckell listed many reasons for advocating the immediate discussion of the issue of China's representation in the United Nations. He said that there is no doubt as to who is the legitimate representative of China, and who has the undeniable right to send representatives to the United Nations.

Czechoslovak delegation leader and Foreign Minister David gave a lengthy speech, emphasizing that refusing to discuss China's representation in the United Nations is more detrimental to the United Nations itself than to the People's Republic of China.

Albanian Foreign Minister Shtulla said that the events in the Far East prove that the issue of restoring the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations must be resolved urgently.

Afghan representative Pazhwak said that the issue of China's representation in the United Nations has attracted worldwide attention, and most member states are concerned and uneasy about this issue. Therefore, the proposal to discuss this issue can no longer be ignored. He said that the proposal put forward by the General Committee based on the United States' opinion is unacceptable to Afghanistan. He said that this proposal does not take into account that any United Nations member state has the legal right to propose the inclusion of issues it deems important and necessary for discussion on the Assembly's agenda. This proposal also fails to take into account that the United Nations is a world forum for discussing important issues that United Nations member states are concerned about and uneasy about.

The Afghan representative emphasized that refusing to discuss China's representation in the United Nations is detrimental to international relations and does not help world peace.

Indonesian representative Sastroamidjojo said that excluding the People's Republic of China from participating in the work of the United Nations would have serious consequences for the United Nations itself, because no important international issue can be resolved without the People's Republic of China, especially disarmament, the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and issues related to maintaining world peace and security.

Irish Foreign Minister Aiken said that his government has no sympathy for communism. However, when the Assembly solves such problems, it cannot base decisions on whether representatives have sympathy or antipathy. Aiken concluded by saying that the Irish delegation will vote in favor of the Asian seven-nation amendment.

Representatives from Britain and Canada opposed discussing the issue of China's representation in the United Nations. British representative Dixon's speech clearly showed Britain's consistent double-dealing on this issue. On the one hand, he said that Britain recognizes the People's Republic of China and maintains normal diplomatic relations with it, but on the other hand, he supports the U.S. position.

Assembly President Malik attempted to end the debate. Indian delegation leader Menon pointed out that the debate in the plenary session on whether to include the bill proposed by the Indian delegation on the agenda was entirely due to the General Committee's majority passage of a proposal that violated the Charter. Menon suggested that the discussion on this issue continue at the morning session on the 23rd, a suggestion that was passed by an overwhelming majority of the Assembly.

### 联大中要求恢复我国席位呼声压不住  许多国家坚决主张讨论中国代表权问题

    联大中要求恢复我国席位呼声压不住
    许多国家坚决主张讨论中国代表权问题
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：在联合国大会22日下午的全体会议上，讨论了关于把中国在联合国的代表权问题列入议程的问题。已经有二十三个国家的代表要求在会上就这个问题发言，这再一次表明，中国代表权问题具有多么巨大的意义。
    放在大会面前的有美国操纵的总务委员会多数通过的美国提案（规定在本届会议上不讨论中国代表权问题）以及七国（阿富汗、缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚、尼泊尔和阿拉伯联合共和国）对美国提案的修正案，这个修正案对美国提案作了根本改变，要求联大本届会议讨论中国代表权问题。
    印度代表团团长梅农在会上第一个发言。他指出，总务委员会通过美国的提案，是超越了它的权力范围、破坏了联合国宪章和大会以往的决议的。
    梅农强调指出，目前在远东发生的事件要求解决这个问题。恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，是代表着人类多数的许多联合国会员国的要求。因此，大会不能漠视这些国家的意见，不把这一问题列入大会议程，因为这些国家认为讨论这个问题是极端重要和刻不容缓的事情。
    美国代表洛奇反对亚非七国的修正案，他除了指出大会前几届会议曾通过类似的决议以外，举不出任何其他理由来支持美国提案。
    接着，苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯发言。葛罗米柯指出，联合国里没有中国的唯一原因，是美国政府对中国人民及其政府所奉行的敌视政策。他说，何时联合国才会不允许把自己作为美国政策的工具呢？
    葛罗米柯指出，英国政府几年以来一直在玩弄两面手法，反对中华人民共和国代表在联合国占有合法席位，这对联合国内在中国代表权问题上所形成的局面负有不小的责任。葛罗米柯接着说，在中国代表权问题上支持美国的立场的国家大多数只是因为受了美国的压力。
    葛罗米柯最后说，苏联代表团无保留地支持印度代表团关于恢复中国在联合国合法代表权的建议。
    美国代表洛奇再度发言，他枉费心机地抵赖葛罗米柯所指出的美国对其他国家代表团施加压力以阻止恢复中华人民共和国席位的事实。洛奇还利用发言的机会，对中华人民共和国和苏联进行恶毒诬蔑。
    保加利亚外交部长卢卡诺夫指出，显然，美国害怕讨论恢复中国在联合国的权利问题，因为它无法为自己在这个问题上的政策辩护。甚至美国的盟国也拒绝支持它。
    瑞典代表罗塞尔要求大会讨论中国在联合国的代表权问题，他说，瑞典政府认为这个问题是极端重要的。他说，应当结束这种反常现象，即一小撮来自台湾岛的人在联合国的机构中执行着一个大国的职能，而中华人民共和国被排挤在这个组织之外。任何论点都不能说服我们。说这种局面是可以容忍的，说没有中华人民共和国参加能够解决重大的国际问题，首先是裁军问题。
    芬兰代表恩克尔列举许多理由，主张立即讨论中国在联合国代表权问题。他说，谁是中国的合法代表，谁有无可争辩的权利派代表到联合国，这是没有任何疑义的。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长、外交部长戴维作了长篇发言，他强调指出，拒绝讨论中国在联合国的代表权问题，与其说对中华人民共和国有害，倒不如说是对联合国本身有害。
    阿尔巴尼亚外交部长什图拉说，远东的事件证明，必须火速解决恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利问题。
    阿富汗代表佩吉瓦克说，中国在联合国的代表权问题引起了全世界的注意，大多数会员国都关心这个问题并感到不安。所以不能再忽视要求讨论这个问题的建议了。他说，总务委员会根据美国的意见提出的建议是阿富汗所不能接受的。他说，这个建议没有考虑到：任何一个联合国会员国有把它认为重要并需要讨论的问题提出列入大会议程的合法权利。这个建议也没有考虑到：联合国是讨论联合国会员国所关心和为之不安的重大问题的世界讲坛。
    阿富汗代表着重说，拒绝讨论中国在联合国的代表权问题有害于国际关系而无助于世界和平。
    印度尼西亚代表沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，排斥中华人民共和国参加联合国工作，会给联合国本身带来严重后果，因为没有中华人民共和国就不能够解决任何一个重要的国际问题，尤其是裁军、停止试验核武器问题以及有关维护世界和平和安全的问题。
    爱尔兰外交部长埃肯说，他的政府对共产主义毫无同情。但是，大会在解决这样问题的时候，不能以代表们这种或那种同情或不同情做为准则。埃肯最后说，爱尔兰代表团将投票支持亚洲七国的修正案。
    英国和加拿大的代表反对讨论中国在联合国的代表权问题。英国代表狄克逊的发言明显地表明了英国在这个问题上一贯玩弄的两面手法。他一方面说，英国承认了中华人民共和国并同它保持着正常外交关系，另一方面却支持美国的立场。
    大会主席马利克企图结束辩论。印度代表团团长梅农发言指出，在全体会议上辩论是否把印度代表团提出的议案列入议程的问题，这完全是由于总务委员会的大多数通过了违背宪章的提案而引起的。梅农建议在23日的上午会议上继续讨论这个问题，这个建议被大会压倒多数所通过。
