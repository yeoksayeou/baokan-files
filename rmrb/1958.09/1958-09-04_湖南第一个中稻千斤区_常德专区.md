Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 2nd: The Changde Special District of Hunan has 3,829,720 mu of middle rice, with a total output of 3,836,660,000 jin, an average yield of more than 1,001 jin per mu, an increase of 628 jin over last year's average yield of 373 jin per mu. This is the first thousand-jin middle rice special district in Hunan Province. This year, the area sown with middle rice in the district is only about half of the area sown last year, but the output has increased by 1,151,600,000 jin compared to last year.

According to statistics, among the seventeen counties and cities in the special district, Anxiang County, Hanshou County, and Yiyang City have an average yield of over 1,300 jin per mu; Changde County, Yuanjiang County, Nan County, and Jinshi have an average yield of over 1,200 jin per mu; Yiyang County has an average yield of over 1,100 jin per mu, and Taojiang County, Anhua County, and Linli County have an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. The Tianjing Agricultural Cooperative in Zhoujiadian Township, Changde County, has an average yield of 4,017 jin per mu on 525 mu of middle rice. There are twenty plots of land in the district with a yield of over 10,000 jin per mu, covering a total area of 18.308 mu. Among them, three experimental plots in Fugui Cooperative, Guanxi Township, Changde County, with an area of 3.131 mu, have an average yield of 15,536 jin per mu, an increase of nearly 30 times compared to last year.

The vast number of farmers in the counties of this special district are filled with joy at seeing the fruits of their victory. A poem composed by the farmers in Zhoujiadian Township, Changde, fully expresses the joy of the masses: "Everyone praises early rice for being good, but middle rice is even higher than early rice. Never has this been seen before, satellites competing to ascend to the ninth heaven."

Now, the farmers in the district are working even harder, seizing the time to carry out the middle-tillage and topdressing of late rice, and eliminating the third category of rice paddies in order to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest.

Also, Ningtian County and Yizhang County in the southern mountainous areas of this province have also become thousand-jin middle rice counties. Ningtian County has 227,240 mu of middle rice, with an average yield of 1,086 jin and 15 liang per mu. Yizhang County has more than 150,000 mu of middle rice, with an average yield of 1,050 jin per mu.

The common characteristic of the bumper harvest of middle rice in these two counties this year is the large-scale balanced increase in production. During the harvest, townships and cooperatives with yields of over 1,000 jin per mu emerged continuously and in large numbers; thousand-jin mu were blooming everywhere. The average yield per mu of middle rice in both counties has increased by more than two times compared to last year.

　　湖南第一个中稻千斤区
　　常德专区
    新华社长沙2日电  湖南常德专区三百八十二万九千七百二十亩中稻，总产量达三十八亿三千六百六十万多斤，平均亩产一千零一斤多，比去年平均亩产三百七十三斤增长了六百二十八斤。这是湖南省出现的第一个中稻千斤专区。今年全区中稻播种面积，虽然只有去年中稻播种面积的二分之一左右，但产量却比去年增加了十一亿五千一百六十万斤。
    据统计，全专区十七个县市，平均亩产一千三百斤以上的有安乡县、汉寿县和益阳市；亩产一千二百斤以上的有常德县、沅江县、南县、津市；亩产一千一百斤以上的有益阳县，亩产一千斤以上的有桃江县、安化县、临澧县。常德县周家店乡天井农业社五百二十五亩中稻平均亩产四千零一十七斤，全区亩产一万斤以上的田有二十丘，面积共一八点三零八亩，其中常德县灌溪乡富贵社三块试验田三点一三一亩，平均亩产一万五千五百三十六斤，比去年增产近三十倍。
    这个专区各县的广大农民，看到自己的胜利果实，到处喜气洋溢。常德周家店乡的农民编的一首诗，充分表达了广大群众的喜悦心情，诗是这样的：“人人都夸早稻好，中稻更比早稻高，从古未见这号事，卫星争上九重霄。”
    现在，全区农民正鼓足更大干劲，抓紧晚稻中耕、追肥、消灭三类禾，争取全面大丰收。
    又讯：这个省的南部山区宁远县和宜章县也分别成为中稻千斤县。宁远县二十二万七千二百四十亩中稻，平均亩产一千零八十六斤十五两。宜章县十五万多亩中稻，平均亩产一千零五十斤。
    这两个县今年中稻丰收的共同特点是大面积平衡增产。收割期间，亩产千斤以上的乡、社不断地大量地涌现；千斤亩更是遍地开花。两县中稻的平均亩产量都比去年平均增加两倍多。
