Xinhua News Agency, September 7th—When news arrived at the Fifth Congress of the International Union of Students that U.S. imperialism was blatantly threatening to expand its aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan Strait area and flagrantly carrying out war provocations against the Chinese people, it aroused great anger among student representatives and observers from various countries. At the beginning of the morning session, student representatives from various countries condemned and protested against the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism and expressed their full support for the just struggle of the Chinese people.

　　The Brazilian student representative strongly protested against the military provocations of U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area in his speech. He said that the military provocations of U.S. imperialism are an interference in China’s internal affairs. The United States’ attempt to deny the beautiful China and the victory of its great socialist construction is futile, because the people of the world recognize this country. The people of this country are doing their best to safeguard the cause of world peace.

　　The Cameroonian student representative said that the military provocations of U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan area are an infringement on peace and all mankind. The peace-loving Chinese people have the right to liberate their own territory of Taiwan, and we express our full support.

　　The Iraqi student representative strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for interfering in China’s internal affairs in his speech. He also said that supporting the Chinese people's struggle is part of defending world peace. We will never stand idly by in the Chinese people's just struggle.

　　Student representatives from Algeria, Japan, and Venezuela also unanimously supported the just struggle of the Chinese people. The speeches of student representatives from various countries were warmly welcomed by all the representatives.

　　At today's meeting, all the representatives unanimously passed a protest telegram to the U.S. government in the name of the Fifth Congress of the International Union of Students, protesting against the military provocations of U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area and threatening peace in the Far East. The protest telegram affirmed that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times, and all the representatives present fully support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate their own territory.

　　At the request of the vast majority of representatives, the presidium of the congress decided to suspend the afternoon's visit, and all the representatives participated in the demonstration and rally in front of Tiananmen Square by the masses of Beijing, protesting against the war provocations of U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area.

　　The meeting then continued to discuss the first item on the agenda. The Cuban representative spoke first at the meeting. He said that U.S. imperialism is secretly or openly supporting the Cuban Batista dictatorial government in its bloody suppression and massacre of the Cuban people. He called on the people and students of the world to rise up to aid the Cuban people's struggle and to stop the United States from continuing to ship weapons into Cuba to massacre the Cuban people.

　　Kim Bong-woon, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said that U.S. imperialism, disregarding the lessons of its defeat on the Korean battlefield, is now carrying out war provocations in Asia. We firmly support the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other coastal islands, and firmly support the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and imperialism.

　　A French observer also spoke at today's meeting.
