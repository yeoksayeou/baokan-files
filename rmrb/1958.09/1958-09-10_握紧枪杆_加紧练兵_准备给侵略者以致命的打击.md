Grip the Guns Tightly, Intensify Training
Prepare to Deal a Fatal Blow to the Invaders
    Premier Zhou Enlai's "Statement on the Situation in the Taiwan Strait Region" solemnly reflects the determination and will of the 600 million people in every word and sentence. We listened to it nine times in a row and held meetings overnight to discuss it. We sternly warn the American invaders: They must get out of Taiwan. If American imperialism dares to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands, it will be met with a fatal blow.

    We guarantee to the Party and the people that in this tense moment of imperialist war provocation, we must grip our guns tightly, intensify our training, and be prepared. We will never fail the expectations of the Party and the people. In order to defend world peace and the inviolability of the motherland's territory, we will spare no effort to strike at any enemy who dares to invade us.

    American imperialism suffered a heavy blow from the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield, but it "forgets the pain as soon as the knife is withdrawn." This is the nature of imperialism. If the American aggressors disregard all consequences and dare to invade again, we will thoroughly defeat this paper tiger.

    握紧枪杆　加紧练兵
    准备给侵略者以致命的打击
    周恩来总理“关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明”的每字、每句都庄严的反映了六亿人民的决心和意志，我们连续听了九遍，并连夜集会进行讨论。我们严正警告美国侵略者：必须滚出台湾去，如果美帝国主义胆敢阻挠我们解放台湾和沿海岛屿，必将遭到致命的打击。
    我们向党和人民保证，在这帝国主义进行战争挑衅的紧张时刻，我们一定要握紧枪杆，加紧练兵，做好准备，决不辜负党和人民对我们的期望，为了保卫世界和平和祖国领土不受侵犯，我们将不惜一切地打击敢于侵略我们的敌人。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上遭到了中国人民志愿军的沉重打击，但他“拔了刀子就忘了痛”，这就是帝国主义的本性。如果美国侵略者竟不顾一切后果，敢再侵犯，我们要彻底打垮这个纸老虎。
