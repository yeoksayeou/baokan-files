    "Zhongzhou Review" Focuses on Criticizing Right-leaning Opportunism
    The theoretical journal "Zhongzhou Review," sponsored by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, launched a serious critique of the right-leaning opportunist thought of Comrade Pan Fusheng, the former First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee, from its first to third issues. Comrade Wu Zhipu, the First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, continuously published three critical articles. The titles of the articles are: "Right-leaning Opportunism is the Main Danger within the Party at Present," "On Pessimism," and "Iron Facts Shatter the Fallacy of 'Large Communes Are Not Superior.'" The first article analyzed that the main content of Pan Fusheng's right-leaning opportunism was the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and pointed out that "the victory of the Henan Party in the struggle against this erroneous thinking of his was the turning point in Henan's work in 1957, from being passive to being active." The second article criticized Pan Fusheng's utter pessimism and analyzed the three main reasons why he, a responsible cadre of the Party, degenerated into a pessimistic and disappointed person regarding the Party's socialist revolutionary cause. One of the main reasons was that he did not understand Chairman Mao's theory of the peasant allies and could not see the broadest and most powerful force for carrying out the socialist revolution. The third article criticized Pan Fusheng's fallacy of "large communes are not superior."
    Collaboration Creates New Productivity
    The third issue of the "Upstream" monthly magazine, sponsored by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, published an article on collaboration written by Zhang Yun. The author used examples to demonstrate the assertion that "collaboration not only improves individual productivity but also creates a kind of productivity" (Marx). He said that through collaboration, that is, through the joint labor of many individual forces combined together, people create a new collective force, which greatly exceeds the simple sum of individual forces. For example, after Chongqing Railway Station improved its collaborative relationships, it completed its transportation tasks thirteen days ahead of schedule in April and seventeen days ahead of schedule in May; the freight workshop of the station also greatly improved its labor productivity by improving labor organization and strengthening collaboration and cooperation. The number of employees was reduced from the original one hundred and six to seventy-five, and the business accidents that had always been considered impossible to eliminate were also eliminated.
    "If There Is One Such Commune, There Will Be Many Communes"
    "If there is one such commune, there will be many communes." This incisive assertion made by Chairman Mao during his inspection of the Qiliying People's Commune in Henan was elaborated on in an article in "New Discourse," sponsored by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The author, Mai Qing, said that Chairman Mao's remarks gave us a vivid lesson in dialectics. Dialectics tells us that the emergence of new things is always individual and in the minority at the beginning, and then it goes from less to more, from points to areas, and from the individual to the general. The article points out that in the struggle against nature and the development of social productive forces, there are certainly many conditions for promoting the development of new things from less to more and from small to large, but the most basic is: the leadership of the Party and the consciousness of the masses. When Chairman Mao inspected Shandong on August 9, he repeatedly emphasized that leaders must go down to see the grassroots more often, help grassroots cadres sum up experiences, and provide on-the-spot guidance, which is to make us pay attention to strengthening the leadership of the Party and maintaining the correctness of the Party's leadership. Strengthening the leadership of the Party is the primary and decisive condition for promoting the transformation of new things from less to more and from points to areas. Because the emergence of new things will not be entirely spontaneous; it is the result of the Party's leadership. To make the individual and minority new things grow and be popularized is to expand the victory of the Party's policies from a small scope to a larger scope. Many facts have proved that in places where the Party's ideological and organizational leadership has been strengthened, new things are quickly popularized and promoted, and large-scale victories are achieved. Another decisive condition that is inseparable from the Party's leadership is the consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses. During his inspection of Shandong, Chairman Mao also particularly emphasized that the deployment of work must be done through mass airing of views and debates, which is to make us pay attention to enlightening the consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses. Because, with the consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses, there will be a real mass movement, and good examples will become the actions of the majority.
    The Significance of Agricultural Tool Reform
    The "Advance" theoretical journal sponsored by the Shanxi Provincial Committee published Wang Qian's article "On the Issue of Agricultural Tool Reform" in its third issue of 1958, discussing the significance of agricultural tool reform. The article says that the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural construction requires a large amount of labor force, "Thus, on the issue of labor force, a sharp contradiction has occurred in the two major national economic sectors of industrial and agricultural production. If in the past a large number of peasants flowed into cities, seriously affecting the relationship between workers and peasants and the relationship between urban and rural areas, then in today's new situation of the great leap forward, if the industrial front does not supplement the labor force from the countryside, it will also affect the relationship between workers and peasants and the relationship between urban and rural areas." The article believes that the fundamental method to solve the shortage of labor force is to increase the degree of mechanization for industry, and for agriculture, it is to carry out agricultural tool reform centered on ball bearingization, and realize the semi-mechanization of agricultural tools.

    “中州评论”集中火力批判右倾机会主义
    中共河南省委主办的理论刊物“中州评论”，从第一期到第三期对原河南省委第一书记潘复生同志的右倾机会主义思想展开严肃的批判。中共河南省委第一书记吴芝圃同志连续发表了三篇批判文章。文章的题目是：“右倾机会主义是当前党内的主要危险”、“论悲观主义”、“铁的事实粉碎了‘大社并不优越’的谬论”。第一篇文章分析了潘复生的右倾机会主义的主要内容是“阶级斗争熄灭论”，并指出，“河南党对他这种错误思想斗争的胜利，是1957年河南工作由被动转向主动的转折点。”第二篇文章批判了潘复生的十足的悲观主义，分析了他由党的一个负责干部堕落为对党的社会主义革命事业悲观失望者的三个主要原因。其中一个主要原因是他不懂得毛主席关于农民同盟军的理论，看不到进行社会主义革命的最广大最雄厚的力量。第三篇文章批判了潘复生的“大社并不优越”的谬论。
    协作创造新的生产力
    中共四川省委主办的“上游”月刊第三期，发表了张允写的论协作的文章，作者用实例论证了“协作不仅提高个人的生产力，并且创造了一种生产力”（马克思）的论断。他说，人们由于协作，即由于许多个别力量结合在一起共同劳动，便创造了一种新的集体的力量，这种力量大大超过了个人力量的简单的总和。例如重庆车站在改善了协作关系以后，4月份即提前十三天完成了运输任务，而5月份则更提前十七天就完成了任务；该站货运车间也由于改善了劳动组织，加强了协作配合，大大提高了劳动生产率，职工由原来的一百零六名减到七十五人，而且还消灭了一向被认为不可能消灭的商务事故。
    “有这样一个社，就会有好多社”
    “有这样一个社，就会有好多社。”毛主席视察河南七里营人民公社时所作的这个精辟论断，在中共山东省委主办的“新论语”上有篇文章作了阐述。作者麦青说，毛主席的这席话，给我们上了一课活生生的辩证法。辩证法告诉我们，新事物的出现，开始总是个别的、少数的，然后由少到多，由点到面，由个别到一般。文章指出，在同自然界作战和发展社会生产力的斗争中，要促使新生事物由少到多，由小到大的发展条件固然很多，最基本的就是：党的领导和群众的自觉。毛主席8月9日在山东视察的时候，一再强调的领导必须多到下面看看，帮助基层干部总结经验，就地进行指导，就是要我们注意加强党的领导，并保持党的领导的正确性。加强党的领导是促进新生事物由少到多，由点到面转化的首要的决定性条件。因为新生事物的出现不会完全是自发的，它是党的领导的结果。使个别的、少数的新生事物发展壮大，普及推广，也就是把党的方针政策的胜利从小范围扩大到更大的范围。不少事实证明，凡加强了党的思想领导和组织领导的地方，新事物很快就得到普及和推广，取得大范围内的胜利。和党的领导不可分割的另一决定性条件，就是群众的自觉性和积极性。毛主席在山东视察时还特别强调部署工作时必须通过群众的鸣放辩论，就是要我们注意启发群众的自觉性和积极性。因为，有了群众的自觉性和积极性，才会有真正的群众运动，才会使好的典型变成多数人的行动。
    农业工具改革的意义
    山西省委主办的理论刊物“前进”1958年第三期上，发表了王谦的“论农业工具改革问题”的文章，论述农具改革的意义。文章中说，工农业建设大跃进，需要大量的劳动力，“这样在劳动力问题上，在工农业生产这两大国民经济部门里，就发生了尖锐的矛盾。如果说，在过去曾经发生过大量农民流入城市，严重地影响过工农关系和城乡关系的话，那末，在今天大跃进的新形势下，工业战线所需要的劳动力，如果农村不给以补充，也同样会影响工农关系和城乡关系。”文章认为解决劳动力不足的根本方法，对工业来说是提高机械化的程度，对农业来说，就是要以滚珠轴承化为中心进行农具改革，实现农业工具的半机械化。
