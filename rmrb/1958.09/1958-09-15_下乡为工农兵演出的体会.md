Experiences of Performing for Workers, Peasants and Soldiers in the Countryside
Feng Runting, Li Ziyuan

    Inspired by the great leap forward of the whole people, the Sichuan People's Art Theater Troupe changed its style, emancipated its mind, and formulated this year's great leap forward plan: In terms of performance, resolutely implement enterprise management, ensure self-sufficiency, and turn profits over to the state. The annual performance target is 760 shows with 600,000 audience members. In terms of creation, vigorously develop and prosper creation, the whole troupe will independently create, organize scripts by outside writers and guide amateur authors for a total of 220 scripts, of which 100 will be independently created.

    Comrades are working hard and striving to move forward. Through several months of hard work and practical work, as of the end of August, 640 performances have been completed, with more than 560,000 audience members, and an income of more than 89,000 yuan. Seventy scripts have been written, more than forty scripts have been organized and guided, and nearly forty other small programs such as singing. Judging from the current progress, there is a reliable guarantee of over fulfilling the annual plan.

    The achievements above are the positive results of the Party-led rectification campaign. In February of this year, in order to cooperate with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and to further meet the cultural needs of the masses, the entire troupe of more than 110 people formed three performance teams and went to the countryside and factories to perform for workers, peasants, and soldiers. Everyone was determined to strengthen labor training, learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and transform their thinking. They changed their past erroneous ideas of being greedy for size, emphasizing ostentation, one-sidedly emphasizing theater art, being unwilling to perform more in the countryside and factories, looking down on labor, and pursuing formalism. With fewer people and fewer things, but carrying many plays. Male comrades pulled carts to transport performance equipment, and female comrades carried backpacks, walking out of the theater and touring in northern Sichuan, western Sichuan, and southern Sichuan for half a year. In the performance activities, many unprecedented and moving events occurred. Comrades scrambled to do various tasks, and always maintained full revolutionary enthusiasm. On the road, they were porters; on the stage, they were actors; during scene changes, they were stagehands; whenever they had free time, they went to promote and organize the audience. Leading cadres also often went down to the teams and lived, ate, and worked with the comrades. Whether they were drivers, secretaries, or personnel cadres, they all worked as actors and doctors, holding six positions at the same time: treating illnesses, acting, ticketing, changing scenes, advance work, and creation. They were very enthusiastic in every field. They pulled carts from Simeng to Jiajiang, marching ninety li in one day, and performed for the villagers that night. From Yangkou in Wusheng to the central town, they pulled boats for forty-five li on the Jialing River, which was rapid, steep, and full of shoals. They performed that night and rushed to Yuechi overnight. After thirty-six consecutive hours without closing their eyes, they still insisted on working. In the past, they emphasized conditions; now, they emphasize serving the audience. As long as the audience can see the play and see it well, the comrades are happy no matter how tired they are. In this way, a style of hard work and simplicity was established, and they were able to integrate with the masses. For example, when we were performing in a certain place in Jintang pulling carts, some people didn't even believe that we were actors, and some even said that we didn't have the taste of artists, but after they watched the play, they not only praised our performance, but also praised our enthusiasm. During the performances in the old revolutionary base areas in Tongnanba, northern Sichuan, we performed continuously for nine shows a day in the square, in the courtyard, and on the ridges of the fields, sometimes braving the wind and rain. The audience would not leave, so we just kept performing with full energy, which greatly encouraged the masses and was warmly welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. After performing for the miners in Mount Emei, the workers gave the performance team a silk banner with the words "Respect to the literary and art fighters who performed for the miners at 1,800 meters!"

    Through contact with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we ourselves were also deeply educated. In western Sichuan, when we performed for the Sichuan Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Recuperation Home, we were moved by their revolutionary optimism, noble communist qualities, and strong will to build socialism. Everyone thought of their own small achievements at work, which could not be compared with theirs at all, and expressed their intention to learn from them. The labor enthusiasm of the workers, peasants, and soldiers and their urgent demand for cultural life were educating us all the time, further enhancing everyone's enthusiasm for touring the countryside and factories and striving for labor training.

    Our touring repertoire was all works that reflected the struggle of real life and were closely related to the current political tasks. These works were constantly enriched while marching, performing, and rehearsing. We not only performed dramas, but also performed storytelling and ballads, and not only performed in theaters and stages, but also sent them to teahouses and streets. One-act plays and multi-act plays are all available, rich and colorful, and therefore warmly welcomed by the masses. The audience said: "In the past, if we wanted to see your plays, we could only see them in Chengdu and Chongqing. This time, you took the initiative to bring the plays to our door, cooperated with the tasks, and met the needs of the masses. We hope you will come more often in the future." This is a sharp criticism of our past work, but it also points out a clear path for our future work.

    In the performance, we were both a performance team and a guidance team. While performing, we actively provided guidance to the amateur cultural activities of the masses. We provided guidance wherever we went. In Pixian, Guanghan, Shifang, Zigong, Wutongqiao and other places, we cooperated with the local cultural centers to organize training classes for village and community cultural and entertainment backbones. Each time, we spent five or six days, with about two or three hundred people. The performance team sent people to teach the basic knowledge of directing, performing, and makeup. Through guidance, the grassroots cultural activities were further promoted. It was generally reflected that "it is more effective than buying a few books and reading them for half a year." The Zigong City Workers' Cultural Palace sent a big-character poster in thanks for their guidance, saying: "You are a revolutionary propaganda team, and also a guidance team."

    Due to the establishment of the spirit of running the troupe diligently and thriftily, the implementation of the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, and the full utilization of human and material resources, making the best use of everyone's talents and making the best use of everything, and tapping the potential of all aspects, work efficiency has been greatly improved and costs have been reduced. Before the rectification campaign, the rehearsal time for each large play was generally more than two months, and the production cost was on average about 3,000 yuan; now, a large play can be rehearsed in one week to ten days, ensuring that it is staged on time. The production cost has also been greatly reduced. For example, the production cost of "Liu Jiemei" was only 15 yuan, "The Cuckoo Calls Again" cost 60 yuan, and "Song of Youth" and "Dedicate Everything to the Party" only cost more than 200 yuan. Everyone cares about economic income and expenditure, and everyone is meticulous in planning and calculation, which has become a good atmosphere.

    Through more than half a year of performances, we have deeply realized that we can complete the tasks that were difficult to complete in the past year or even two years in a relatively short period of time. This is entirely due to the correct leadership of the Party and the great nationwide rectification campaign. With politics in command, it has gathered into a strong and huge force.

    Practice has proved that only by combining tasks, facing production, and thinking about the vast workers, peasants, and soldiers everywhere can we be welcomed by the masses. We are very clear that the tasks before us are arduous and difficult, and we need to further improve the quality of our work, especially our creative tasks must further delve into life, delve into reality, and strengthen creation. We all have the confidence and determination to consolidate and expand the results of the rectification campaign under the leadership of the Party in the future, study Chairman Mao's works hard, hold high the red flag and move towards the road of "red" and "expert," and successfully complete the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the Party!

    下乡为工农兵演出的体会
    冯润庭　李自元
    四川人民艺术剧院话剧团在全民大跃进形势的鼓舞下，改变了作风，解放了思想，订出了今年的大跃进计划：在演出方面，坚决实行企业化，保证做到自给自足，并向国家上缴利润，全年演出七百六十场，观众六十万人次。在创作方面，大力发展和繁荣创作，全院自行创作、组织院外作家和辅导业余作者剧本共二百二十个，其中自行创作的一百个。
    同志们鼓足了干劲，力争上游，通过几个月的苦干实干，截至8月底止，已完成演出任务六百四十场，观众五十六万余人次，收入八万九千余元。剧本已写出七十个，组织辅导的剧本四十余个，其他演唱等小型节目将近四十个。就目前所完成任务的情况来看，已经有了超额完成全年计划的可靠的保证。
    以上这些成绩的取得是党所领导的整风运动的积极成果。本年2月间，剧院为了配合工农业生产大跃进和进一步满足群众的文化要求，全团一百一十余人组成了三个演出队，下乡下厂为工农兵演出。每个人都抱着加强劳动锻炼向工农兵学习改造思想的决心，改变了过去贪大、讲排场、片面强调剧场艺术、不愿多下乡下厂演出、轻视劳动、追求形式等错误思想。人少东西少，但是戏带的多。男同志拉着板车装运演出器材，女同志背着背包，走出了剧场，在川北、川西、川南进行了为时半年的巡回演出。在演出活动中，出现了许多前所未有的动人事例。各项工作，同志们都争先恐后地抢着干，始终保持了饱满的革命干劲。在路上是搬运工人，上舞台是演员，换景时是迁换工人，一有空就去宣传组织观众。领导干部也经常下队和同志们同吃、同住、同劳动，不管是司机、秘书、人事干部都兼作演员、医生，同时身兼六职：治病、演戏、票务、迁换、前站、创作，那一门都干得很起劲。他们拉板车由司蒙到夹江一天行军九十里，当天夜里又给老乡演出。在武胜沿口到中心镇，在水急坡陡滩多的嘉陵江上拉航行军四十五里，当晚演出，连夜又赶赴岳池。连着三十六小时没有合眼，仍然坚持工作。过去强调条件，现在强调为观众服务。只要观众能看到戏、能看好戏，同志们再累也高兴。就这样树立了艰苦朴素的作风，做到了和群众打成一片。如我们拉着板车在金堂某地演出时，有些人甚至不相信我们是演员，有的更说我们没有艺术家的味道，但当他们看完戏后，不仅赞扬了我们的演出，而且赞扬了我们的干劲。在去川北通南巴一带老根据地演出中，在广场、在院坝、在田坎一天曾连续演出过九场，有时冒着风雨，观众不散就一股劲的演，对群众的鼓舞很大，受到了工农兵群众的热烈欢迎。在峨嵋山为采矿工人演出后，工人们送给演出队一面锦旗，上面写着“向为一千八百公尺采矿工人演出的文艺战士致敬！”
    通过和工农兵群众的接触，也深深地教育了我们自己。在川西为四川革命残废军人教养院演出，他们那种革命的乐观主义精神，崇高的共产主义品质，和建设社会主义的坚强意志，使我们受到了感动。每个人都想到自己工作的点滴成绩，和他们简直不能相比，都表示要向他们学习。工农兵的劳动热情和对文化生活的迫切要求，随时随地都在教育着我们，更加增强了大家下乡下厂巡回演出和争取劳动锻炼的热情。
    我们的巡回演出剧目全部都是反映现实生活斗争、密切结合当前政治任务的剧目，这些剧目都是在边行军、边演出、边排练当中，不断地充实起来的。不仅演出话剧，而且也演出说唱、快板，不仅在剧场、舞台上演出，而且也送到茶馆、街头演出。独幕剧、多幕剧样样都有，丰富多彩，因之受到了群众的热烈欢迎。观众说：“过去想看你们的戏只有到成都、重庆才可以看到，这次你们主动的把戏送上门来，配合了任务，满足了群众的要求，希望你们以后多来”。这对我们过去的工作是一个尖锐的批评，但却对我们今后的工作也指出了一条明确的道路。
    演出中我们做到了既是演出队也是辅导队。在演出的同时积极地对群众业余文艺活动进行了辅导。走到那里，辅导到那里。在郫县、广汉、什邡、自贡、五通桥等地均与当地文化馆组织了乡、社文娱骨干训练班，每次用五、六天的时间，人数约二、三百人，由演出队派人进行导演、表演、化妆各方面基本知识的传授。通过辅导进一步推动了基层的文艺活动，普遍反映说：“比买几本书读半年还关火”。自贡市工人文化宫为答谢对他们的辅导送来的大字报说：“你们是革命的宣传队，也是辅导队。”
    由于树立了勤俭办团的精神，贯彻了多、快、好、省的方针，并充分发挥了人力物力，使人尽其才物尽其力，挖掘了各方面的潜力，大大提高了工作效率，降低了成本。整风前每个大戏排练时间一般均在两月以上，制作费平均在三千元左右；现在一个大戏一周到十天即可排出，保证按期上演。制作费也大大降低了，如“刘介梅”制作费只用了十五元，“布谷鸟又叫了”花了六十元，“青春之歌”“把一切献给党”也只花了二百余元。人人关心经济收入和开支，人人精打细算，已经成为一种良好的风气。
    经过半年多来的演出，使我们深深体会到能够在较短的时间里完成过去一年甚至两年也难完成的任务，这完全是由于党的正确领导和伟大的全民整风运动，政治挂了帅，所以就汇集成了一股坚强的巨大力量。
    实践证明，只有结合任务，面向生产，处处为广大的工农兵着想，才会受到群众的欢迎。我们十分清楚，摆在我们面前的任务是繁重的艰巨的，需要进一步提高工作质量，特别是我们的创作任务必须进一步深入生活，深入实际，加强创作。我们大家都有信心有决心今后在党的领导下，巩固扩大整风成果，努力学习毛主席著作，高举红旗向“红”“专”的大道迈进，胜利完成党所赋予我们的光荣任务！
