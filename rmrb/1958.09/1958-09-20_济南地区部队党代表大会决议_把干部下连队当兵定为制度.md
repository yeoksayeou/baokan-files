Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th - The Jinan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, at its recent Party Congress, passed the "Resolution on Cadres Regularly Going Down to Companies as Soldiers and Participating in Physical Labor," requiring cadres above the rank of platoon leader in subordinate units (except for those whose physical condition does not permit) to spend one month each year as soldiers in the companies. It also requires that all levels of cadres, except those who are ill or too weak to participate in physical labor, actively participate in socialist economic construction and the military's industrial and agricultural production along with the organs and companies, and labor together with the soldiers. The resolution states that cadres regularly going down to companies as soldiers and participating in physical labor is one of the important measures to inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of unity between officers and soldiers and unity between the military and the people in our army. It is of great political significance for improving leadership style, enhancing cadres' sense of labor and mass concept, and cultivating a cadre contingent that is both red and expert.

At the Party Congress, Shu Tong, First Secretary and Political Commissar of the Jinan Military Region Party Committee, made a report. Yang Dezhi, Second Secretary and Commander of the Party Committee, said in his speech that cadres going down to companies as soldiers has many benefits: it can eliminate "five airs" and strengthen the cultivation of cadres' ideological awareness; it can oppose bureaucracy and subjectivism, and improve leadership style and methods; after becoming soldiers, they can personally experience the life and thoughts and feelings of soldiers, and understand the methods and problems of lower-level cadres in managing and educating soldiers; they can put forward better opinions on revising regulations and teaching materials and better handling rationalization proposals based on personal experience, which will help overcome dogmatism; it can exercise and enhance the physical fitness of cadres, and enhance cadres' mass concept and labor concept, and further close the relationship between officers and soldiers and between the military and the people. He also said that when he first joined the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, he had served as a soldier, but he felt that he had been detached from the life of soldiers for a long time, and it was very necessary to take some time to go down to the company as a soldier every year in the future. The delegates attending the meeting warmly supported this resolution and expressed their determination to implement it resolutely.

In the past six months, the Jinan Military Region has resolutely implemented the instructions on the military participating in industrial and agricultural production labor, implemented the Party's policy of sending cadres to lower levels, and adopted the method of leading cadres planting experimental fields. Many cadres have gone down to companies as soldiers or served as company commanders and instructors, and participated in physical labor in factories and rural areas, experiencing the life of soldiers, which has greatly changed the face of the troops and the style of cadres. This resolution is to institutionalize the regular participation of all cadres in physical labor and living the life of soldiers, and gradually consolidate it.

    济南地区部队党代表大会决议
    把干部下连队当兵定为制度
    新华社济南19日电　中国人民解放军济南地区部队，在最近举行的党代表大会上，通过了“关于干部定期下连当兵和参加体力劳动的决议”，要求所属部队排以上干部（除身体条件不许可者）每年必须以一个月的时间下连当兵，并要求除有病和体弱不能参加体力劳动的干部以外，各级干部均应随同机关、连队积极参加社会主义经济建设和部队的工农业生产，和士兵一起劳动。决议中说，干部定期下连当兵和参加体力劳动，是继承和发扬我军官兵一致、军民一致的优良传统的重要措施之一，它对改进领导作风，提高干部的劳动观念和群众观念，培养又红又专的干部队伍，都具有重大的政治意义。
    在党代表大会上，济南地区部队党委第一书记、政治委员舒同作了报告，党委第二书记、司令员杨得志在讲话中说，干部下连当兵好处很多：可以打掉“五气”，加强干部思想意识的修养；可以反掉官僚主义和主观主义，改进领导作风和领导方法；当兵以后能亲身体验战士的生活和思想感情，了解下层干部对战士的管教方法及存在的问题；可以根据亲身体会提出更好的修改条令、教范的意见和更好的处理合理化建议，有助于克服教条主义；可以锻炼和增强干部的体质，可以增强干部的群众观念和劳动观念，进一步密切官兵关系和军民关系。他还说，他刚参加工农红军的时候，曾当过兵，但他觉得自己脱离士兵生活很久了，今后每年抽出一定时间下连当兵十分需要。到会代表热烈拥护这一决议，并表示坚决贯彻执行。
    济南地区部队，半年来由于坚决贯彻了军队参加工农业生产劳动的指示，执行了党的干部下放政策，采取了领导干部种试验田的方法，许多干部下连当兵或当连长、指导员，到工厂、农村参加体力劳动，体验士兵生活，使部队面貌和干部作风起了很大变化，这一决议是使全体干部定期参加体力劳动和过士兵生活形成制度，并逐步使其巩固起来。
