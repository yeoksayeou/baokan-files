　　Earth Coke Oven with a Capacity of Over 1,000 Tons
　　Sweet Potato Flour Cleverly Made into Plywood

　　The Coking Plant of the Handan City Comprehensive Industrial Company in Hebei Province has built a coke oven using indigenous methods with a capacity of 1,000 tons. This kiln has a high output and good coke quality, producing 15,000 tons of coke annually with fifteen cycles. It is now being widely promoted in various indigenous coking plants in Handan.

　　Xushui County, Hebei Province, has built a small blast furnace without using refractory bricks. The furnace wall is made of powder ground from broken pottery jars, and the bottom of the furnace is made of coke powder, pottery jar powder, and dried clay. The blast furnace is 2.8 meters high, with the outside and bottom entirely made of blue bricks. This small blast furnace can produce more than 80 *jin* (approx. 40 kg) of iron per hour.

　　Cao Quanhui, the Party Branch Secretary of Zhouyang Township in Yidu County, Hubei Province, and carpenter Le Zhaowen converted the manual blower of the iron smelting plant into an animal-powered blower. One cow can now drive two blowers simultaneously, saving twenty man-days per day. The cost is only fifteen yuan. (Zhou Yikuang)

　　The Zhuzhou Steel Pen Harmonica Battery Factory, in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient zinc and galvanized iron supply, uses only a very small amount of zinc sheet as a conductor and replaces the rest entirely with glass tubes to make batteries. It is now in mass production. (Yin Meisheng)

　　The Xiaogouping Chemical Plant Nitrate Mine in Huining County, Gansu Province, which is locally state-owned, is the largest natural mirabilite mine in China and can produce more than twenty products such as sodium sulfate and sodium sulfide. It has now been put into production using indigenous methods. More than 50 tons of sodium sulfate containing 96% anhydrous mirabilite that have been produced will soon be shipped abroad. (Jia Xikui)

　　After the staff of the Jimo County Yellow Wine Factory in Shandong Province created a running water cooling method, they solved the phenomenon that the fermentation workshop had to stop production every summer due to excessive temperature in previous years. (Xing Lizhi)

　　Yang Guangjin, a worker at the plywood workshop of the Guanghua Timber Factory in Beijing, used plywood made with sweet potato flour glue. Not only is the quality superior to soybean flour glue, but it also has the advantages of easy preparation, high adhesion, and low cost. (Jia Ping)
