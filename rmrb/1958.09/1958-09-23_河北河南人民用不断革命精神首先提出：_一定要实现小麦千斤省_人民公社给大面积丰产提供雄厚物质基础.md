    (Our Reporter, Wen Ying) Hebei Province recently formulated an ambitious plan to strive to become a "Thousand-Jin Wheat Province" next year. Now, the people of the entire province are relying on the enormous power of the people's communes to actively carry out various preparatory works for wheat sowing, with deep plowing of land as the center.

    In order to increase the proportion of summer harvest crops and strive to obtain a grain harvest equivalent to this year's entire year's harvest next summer, Hebei Province plans to plant 40 million mu of winter wheat this autumn, striving for 45 million mu; and plant 10 million to 15 million mu of spring wheat and other summer harvest crops, with an average yield per mu striving to reach over 1,000 jin. The sown area of summer harvest crops next year will increase by 50% compared to this year; the yield per unit area and total output will increase by six to nine times respectively compared to this year.

    Increasing the proportion of summer harvest crops and striving for a thousand jin of wheat per mu is a strategically significant greater leap forward on Hebei Province's agricultural production front. After the plan of producing a thousand jin of wheat per mu is realized, the figure of summer harvest wheat next year will be equivalent to twice the total grain output of the entire year of 1957. The province's more than 45 million people will have an average of 1,000 jin of wheat per person, and with the autumn crops added, each person can reach 2,000 jin of grain.

    The plan to strive to become a Thousand-Jin Wheat Province is fully conditional in Hebei. In 1958, the people of the entire province created an unprecedented miracle of wheat high yield, shattering the old concept of low wheat yield. In various soil and climatic conditions such as high-altitude mountainous areas, river beach sand areas, and low-lying alkaline land, 180,000 mu of "satellite" fields and large-scale high-yield models with a thousand jin, double thousand jin, and even over five thousand jin of wheat were created. These high-yield models are distributed in more than 1,200 agricultural cooperatives and production teams in over 90% of the counties and cities in the province, and high-yield red flags have been widely erected throughout the province. This has greatly liberated people's minds and opened up the road for larger-scale high yields. At the same time, the entire province has realized the people's commune system, mobilizing and stimulating the greater revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members. Moreover, the unified planning of the people's communes facilitates cooperation, concentration of manpower and material resources, and organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization, which provide a solid material force for increasing wheat production next year.

    In order to realize the plan of producing a thousand jin of wheat per mu next year, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee put forward a number of guarantees centered on deep plowing of the land, and the operating procedures for achieving thousand-jin high yield -- managing wheat fields like gardens; and put forward the heroic slogan of "Let wheat grow according to people's will, and let output be realized according to people's plans." The specific requirements are: (1) Ensure that all wheat land is deeply plowed to a depth of one and a half to two feet or more, and high-yield fields need to be deeper. At present, specialized teams for deep plowing have been universally established in people's communes, and the movement of deep plowing is being widely carried out in various places in conjunction with the autumn harvest. In order to improve the efficiency of deep plowing, more than 1 million pieces of deep plowing tools have been renovated throughout the province. (2) Ensure that sufficient fertilizer is applied. It is required that each mu of wheat land strive to apply 100,000 jin of base fertilizer and more than 1,000 jin of soil-based fertilizer. (3) Fully utilize machine wells and all irrigation water sources to ensure water for wheat. Currently, over 90% of the province's 40 million mu of winter wheat land has sufficient irrigation water sources. (4) Every plot of land should be densely planted. It is required that 40 jin or so of seeds be sown per mu, and no less than 36 jin for varieties with more tillers.

    (Our Reporter, Hu Minru) On the basis of the unprecedented bumper wheat harvest this summer, Henan Province has decided to continue to organize a greater leap forward in wheat production, and will achieve a "Thousand-Jin Wheat Province" next year. The first battle of wheat sowing preparation, the deep plowing movement, and other preparations have already been launched throughout the province.

    The total output of nearly 70 million mu of wheat in Henan Province this summer increased by 11.4 billion jin compared to last year, an increase of one and a half times, and the average yield per unit area reached 282 jin, which is also nearly one and a half times higher than last year. 220,000 mu of wheat in the province reached more than 1,000 jin per mu, and 3.2 mu of wheat reached more than 7,000 jin per mu. Many high-yield fields are growing at high speed, generally several times, dozens of times, or dozens of times more. This situation shows that Henan's wheat production potential is still very large. In order to strive for a greater leap forward in wheat production, Henan Province has decided to plant 80 million mu of wheat this autumn, an expansion of 10 million mu compared to last year. It is also required that the average yield per unit area reach 1,000 jin per mu, to achieve a "Thousand-Jin Wheat Province," and strive to produce 80 billion jin of wheat next year. Among the 80 million mu of wheat planting area, the method of engaging in large-scale high-yield fields and "satellite" fields is adopted, requiring 20 million mu of wheat to reach 2,000 jin per mu, of which 5 million mu will reach 5,000 jin per mu, and 100,000 mu will reach 10,000 jin per mu, and resolutely eliminate low-yield counties with less than 500 jin.

    In order to realize this grand wheat production increase plan, Henan Province has decided to first grasp the central key to increasing production, which is deep plowing of the land, to lay a good foundation for a greater wheat harvest next year. All 80 million mu of wheat fields in the province must be deeply plowed to a depth of one foot two inches to one foot five inches before sowing this year, and large-scale high-yield fields and satellite fields must be deeply plowed more than three feet. In terms of fertilization, it is required to combine deep plowing of the land with layered fertilization. Generally, more than 50,000 jin of base fertilizer are applied to ordinary wheat fields, and more than 100,000 jin of base fertilizer are generally applied to high-yield fields. In terms of irrigation, it is required to ensure water for wheat, generally watering six to seven times. In terms of dense planting, it is required that this year's ordinary wheat fields sow more than 30 jin per mu, and large-scale high-yield fields and "satellite" fields require reaching more than 50 jin, so as to achieve dense planting with full seedlings, many ears, large ears, and full grains. In terms of good seeds, efforts should be made to achieve complete good seed utilization.

    At present, various wheat sowing preparations in Henan Province are progressing rapidly, and the deep plowing movement, which strives to start the first shot of next year's great wheat harvest, has been launched throughout the province in full swing. More than 10 million commune members throughout the province are fighting day and night, and the deeply plowed land has reached more than 26 million mu, with a depth generally reaching more than one foot two inches, some reaching two feet to three feet, and a few "satellite" fields even reaching deep plowing of five feet to one zhang. The reform movement of deep plowing and dense planting farm implements has also progressed rapidly. More than 1.21 million deep plowing plows have been modified throughout the province, and dense planting drills have reached 750,000. Now, the people of the entire province, who have realized the people's commune system, are full of confidence, full of energy, and high in morale, and are determined to fight for the realization of a "Thousand-Jin Wheat Province."

    河北河南人民用不断革命精神首先提出：
    一定要实现小麦千斤省
    人民公社给大面积丰产提供雄厚物质基础
    本报讯　记者文英报道：河北省最近作出了力争明年实现小麦千斤省的宏伟计划。现在全省人民正依靠人民公社的巨大力量，积极进行以深翻土地为中心的小麦播种的各项准备工作。
    为了提高夏收作物比重，力争明年夏季就拿到相当于今年全年收获的粮食，河北省计划在今秋种冬小麦四千万亩，争取四千五百万亩；种春小麦和其他夏收作物一千万亩到一千五百万亩，平均亩产量力争达到千斤以上。明年夏收作物的播种面积比今年增加了50％；单位面积产量和总产量，将分别比今年提高六倍到九倍以上。
    夏收作物比重增加，力争亩产千斤麦，这是河北省农业生产战线上有战略意义的更大跃进。亩产小麦千斤的计划实现以后，明年夏收小麦的数字，就相当于1957年全年粮食总产量的二倍。全省四千五百多万人民，每人平均可有一千斤小麦，加上秋季作物，每人可达到二千斤粮食。
    力争实现小麦千斤省的计划，在河北是有充分条件的。1958年，全省人民就创造了前所未有的小麦丰产奇迹，粉碎了小麦低产的陈旧观念。在高寒的山地、河滩沙地以及低洼碱地等各种不同的土质气候条件下，创造了十八万亩千斤、双千斤甚至五千斤以上的小麦“卫星”田和大面积丰产典型。这些丰产典型，分布在全省90％以上县、市的一千二百多个农业社和生产队，在全省范围内普遍插起了丰产红旗。大大解放了人们的思想，为更大面积的丰产开辟了道路。同时，全省已经实现人民公社化，调动和激发了广大社员的更大的革命干劲，而且由于人民公社统一规划，便于协作，人力、物力的集中，以及组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化等有利于进行生产的优越条件为明年小麦增产提供了雄厚的物质力量。
    为了实现明年小麦亩产千斤的计划，河北省委和省人委提出了以深翻地为主的多项保证，和实现千斤丰产的操作规程——麦田管理园田化；并提出了“叫小麦按人的意志生长，叫产量按人的计划实现”的英雄口号。具体要求是：（一）保证全部小麦地一律深翻一尺半到二尺以上，丰产田还需要深一些。目前，各人民公社都普遍建立了深翻地专业队，结合秋收，深耕地的运动已在各地普遍开展起来。为提高深翻地效率，全省已改造好深翻地的工具一百多万件。（二）保证肥料要施足。要求每亩麦地争取施底肥十万斤，并施土化肥千斤以上。（三）充分利用机井和一切灌溉水源，保证小麦用水。现全省四千多万亩冬小麦地，90％以上有了充足的灌溉水源。（四）块块地都要密植。要求每亩下种四十斤上下，分蘖多的品种也不少于三十六斤。
    本报讯　记者胡敏如报道：在今年夏季小麦空前大丰收的基础上，河南省决定继续组织小麦更大跃进，要在明年实现小麦千斤省。现在麦播准备的第一仗深翻土地运动和其他准备工作已在全省展开。
    河南省今年夏季近七千万亩小麦总产量比去年增产一百一十四亿斤，增长一倍半，单位面积产量平均达到二百八十二斤，也比去年增产将近一倍半。全省有二十二万亩小麦亩产达到一千斤以上，有三点二亩小麦亩产达到七千多斤。很多高额丰产田更是高速度增长，一般都在几倍，十几倍，几十倍以上。这种情况表明河南小麦生产潜力还大得很。为了争取小麦更大的跃进，河南省决定今年秋播小麦面积达到八千万亩，比去年扩大一千万亩。并要求每亩平均单位面积产量达到一千斤，实现小麦千斤省，争取明年生产小麦八百亿斤。在八千万亩小麦播种面积中，采取大搞大面积高额丰产田和“卫星”田的办法，要求有二千万亩小麦能达到亩产二千斤，其中五百万亩达到亩产五千斤，十万亩达到亩产一万斤，并坚决消灭五百斤以下的低产县。
    为了实现这个宏伟的小麦增产计划，河南省决定首先抓住深翻土地这一中心增产关键，为保证明年小麦更大丰收打下良好基础。全省八千万亩小麦田今年在播种以前都要深翻一尺二寸至一尺五寸，大面积高额丰产田和卫星田深翻三尺以上。在施肥方面，要求结合深翻土地分层施肥，一般麦田施底肥五万斤以上，高额丰产田一般施底肥十万斤以上。在灌溉方面，要求保证小麦用水，一般要浇水六至七次。在密植方面，要求今年一般麦田每亩播种三十斤以上，大面积高额丰产田和“卫星”田要求达到五十斤以上，做到密植全苗，穗多穗大粒饱。在良种方面，力争做到全部良种化。
    目前，河南省各项麦播准备工作进展很快，争取打响明年小麦大丰收第一炮的深翻土地运动，已在全省热火朝天地开展起来。全省每天都有一千多万公社社员在日夜奋战，深翻的土地已经达到二千六百多万亩，深度一般都达到一尺二寸以上，有的达到二尺到三尺，少数“卫星”田还达到深翻五尺到一丈。深耕密植农具改革运动也进展很快，全省改制深耕犁已有一百二十一万多部，密植耧达到七十五万部。现在，实现了人民公社化的全省人民，信心百倍，干劲十足，情绪高涨，决心为实现小麦千斤省而斗争。
