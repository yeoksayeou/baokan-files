    Industrial Common Sense
    Silicates
    In the construction of "Four No Need" buildings, silicates are a new material replacing red bricks and cement. Silicates are generally made of lime and sand as the main materials, and can also be prepared with shale, slag, fly ash, mineral slag and other materials. This is a high-strength artificial stone material that can be used for walls, stairs, columns, floors and other components of buildings.
    The silicate components manufactured for the "Four No Need" buildings have a strength of over 100, meeting the quality requirements of the construction.
    Glass Fiber Reinforcement
    Glass fiber reinforcement, which replaces steel reinforcement, is made by gluing ordinary glass fiber with resin and pressing it into long rod-shaped reinforcement. It has excellent tensile, compressive and anti-corrosion properties, so it is better than bamboo reinforcement as a substitute for steel reinforcement.
    Magnesia Cement
    Magnesia cement, which replaces wood, is made of materials such as sawdust, shavings and talc powder. It has fire resistance, sound insulation, heat preservation and insulation properties. Although its water resistance is poor, these shortcomings can be prevented and overcome by applying paint and other measures. Magnesia cement can be used for wood products such as doors, windows, floors and wooden furniture.

    工业常识
    矽酸盐
    在“四不用”大楼的建筑中矽酸盐是代替红砖和水泥的新材料。矽酸盐一般是用石灰、砂子为主要材料，还可用页岩、炉渣、烟灰、矿渣等多种材料进行配制。这是一种高强度的人造石料，可以做房屋的墙、楼梯、柱子、楼板等构件。
    “四不用”大楼制造的矽酸盐构件强度达到一百号以上，满足了建筑质量要求。
    玻璃丝筋
    代替钢筋的玻璃丝筋是将一般玻璃丝用树脂胶合压成长棒形的筋。它具有抗拉、抗压和防蚀等优良性能，因此代替钢筋，性能比竹筋好。
    菱苦土
    代替木材的菱苦土是用锯末、刨花和滑石粉等材料制的，具有耐火、隔音、保温、绝缘等性能，它虽然抗水性较差，但是只要涂上油漆等措施，这些缺点是可以防止和克服的。菱苦土可作门窗、地板、木器家俱等木制品。
