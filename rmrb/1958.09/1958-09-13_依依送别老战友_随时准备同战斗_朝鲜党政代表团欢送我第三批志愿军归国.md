Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 12th: A Korean Labor Party and Republic Government delegation, headed by Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, arrived at a certain location in Korea this morning, accompanied by Cao Keqiang, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, to bid farewell to the vanguard troops of the third group of Chinese People's Volunteers returning home. The delegation also included Park Jeong-ae, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Labor Party, Nam Il, Vice-Premier of the Cabinet and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Korea, Ha Ang-cheon and Kim Ik-seon, alternate members of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Korean Labor Party, Jeong Seong-eon, Minister of Local Management, General Lee Kwon-mu, Chief of General Staff of the Korean People's Army, and Lieutenant General Kim Tae-geun, Director of the General Political Bureau, among twelve people.

The delegation was greeted by the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the third group of Chinese People's Volunteers returning home.

General Wang Ping, Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Lieutenant General Liang Biye, Deputy Political Commissar, and Major General Wang Yunrui, Chief of Staff, also rushed from their station to welcome the delegation.

Chairman Choi Yong-kun, accompanied by General Wang Ping, Head of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Cao Keqiang, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, and others, reviewed the honor guard.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 12th: A grand meeting was held this afternoon by the Korean Party and Government delegation, headed by Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to bid farewell to the third group of Chinese People's Volunteers returning home.

The meeting was attended by General Wang Ping, Lieutenant General Liang Biye, Major General Wang Yunrui, leaders of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and General Yan Jinsheng, commander of a certain unit of the third group of Chinese People's Volunteers returning home, along with representatives of the broad masses of officers and soldiers.

Cao Keqiang, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, also attended the meeting.

The farewell meeting began with the solemn national anthems of Korea and China. Chairman Choi Yong-kun delivered a farewell speech. He said that the American imperialists occupying China's territory of Taiwan have recently become even more blatant in carrying out heinous provocative activities against the People's Republic of China. This is not only an act of aggression against the Chinese people, but also a direct provocation against world peace and security. The American imperialist aggressor troops must immediately cease their brutal armed interference in China's internal affairs and must immediately withdraw from Taiwan. The Korean people fully support the Chinese people's just struggle for territorial integrity and sovereignty and are confident that the Chinese people will be victorious in this struggle.

Choi Yong-kun said that the American imperialists, frantically pursuing a policy of war, are today moving atomic weapons and rocket weapons into South Korea, turning South Korea into an American atomic base, and instigating the Syngman Rhee bandit gang to stir up a "Northward March." If the imperialists, disregarding the repeated serious warnings from the peoples of Korea and China and the strong protests from the people of the world, do not stop their war provocations in the Far East and deliberately launch a new war of aggression, then they should deeply understand that they will inevitably suffer a more disastrous defeat than in the Korean War.

In his speech, Choi Yong-kun elaborated in detail on the unbreakable internationalist fighting friendship between the peoples of Korea and China, and warmly praised the great internationalist spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers and their great contribution and immortal achievements to the cause of world peace. He said that more than 6,827,000 people in Korea have signed letters of gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese people, with boundless gratitude and friendship.

Choi Yong-kun concluded his speech amidst warm applause. Representatives of the Korean Party, government, and military leading organs and the Korean Democratic Youth League, including Park Jeong-ae, General Lee Kwon-mu, and Park Yong-guk, presented silk banners to a certain unit of the third group of Chinese People's Volunteers returning home. Choi Yong-kun and all the delegates of the delegation awarded the commanders of a certain unit of the third group of Chinese People's Volunteers returning home with commemorative medals of Korean-Chinese friendship.

General Yan Jinsheng, commander of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, then delivered a reply speech, thanking the Korean Party and Government delegation for their kind encouragement and farewell. He said that the fact that the third group of Chinese People's Volunteers is beginning to withdraw from Korea at a time when American imperialism is creating tension in the Far East forms a sharp contrast to the provocative actions of American imperialism and its lackey, the Syngman Rhee clique. This not only demonstrates the consistent sincerity of the Chinese and Korean peoples in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, but also fully demonstrates the unparalleled confidence of the Chinese and Korean peoples in defending peace and preventing aggression. If the American aggressors dare to take risks again, we can assert that they will inevitably suffer a more disastrous and more shameful defeat.

General Yan Jinsheng thanked the Korean people for their meticulous care and full support for the Chinese People's Volunteers. He said that we must transform this lofty friendship into combat power, and be ready at all times to heed the call of the motherland and inflict a heavier blow on the enemy than in the Korean battlefield if they dare to launch a new adventure.

After the farewell meeting, art troupes accompanying the delegation gave a splendid farewell performance.

Before the farewell meeting, Chairman Choi Yong-kun and others met with senior commanders of a certain unit of the third group of Chinese People's Volunteers returning home.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 12th: A grand banquet was held tonight by the Korean Party and Government delegation headed by Choi Yong-kun to bid farewell to representatives of officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the third group of Chinese People's Volunteers returning home.

General Wang Ping, Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Lieutenant General Liang Biye, Deputy Political Commissar, Major General Wang Yunrui, Chief of Staff, and Cao Keqiang, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, who accompanied the delegation, were invited to attend the banquet.

Chairman Choi Yong-kun spoke at the beginning of the banquet. He said that American imperialism is blatantly planning to expand its aggression against the People's Republic of China and obstruct the peaceful reunification of the Korean people. The Korean people will always stand together with the Chinese people. The peoples of Korea and China will surely drive American imperialism out of their territories.

General Tang Jinlong, commander of a certain unit of the third group of Chinese People's Volunteers returning home, also spoke at the banquet. He said that all of our officers and soldiers will soon leave heroic Korea with reluctant feelings. Our hearts will always be linked with the Korean people. The sea may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but the fighting friendship cemented with blood between the Chinese and Korean peoples will last forever.

Before the banquet began, Chairman Choi Yong-kun and other representatives presented gifts to the commanders of a certain unit of the third group of returning troops on behalf of Premier Kim Il-sung.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 12th: The third group of Chinese People's Volunteers returning home, while closely watching American imperialism's war provocations in the Taiwan area and maintaining a high degree of vigilance at all times, is vigorously carrying out preparations for the withdrawal of troops.

Under the slogan of "Handing over well, leaving well, and arriving well," all units have prepared a large amount of materials for the People's Army comrades taking over, renovated barracks and utensils, and beautified the environment of the station.

At the same time, all units are using every bit of time to help the Korean people with production and labor. A unit under a certain unit helped the local agricultural cooperative to build offices, propaganda rooms, or bridges. The health camp of a certain unit built two health stations and a veterinary station for two villages near the station, and trained eleven health workers. The officers and soldiers of a certain motor vehicle company also used waste materials to help the agricultural cooperative build a agricultural tool repair station.

All units have also organized many visiting groups to go to local agricultural cooperatives, factories, and schools to learn from the heroic deeds and advanced experiences of the Korean people.

    依依送别老战友  随时准备同战斗
    朝鲜党政代表团欢送我第三批志愿军归国
    新华社平壤12日电  以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府代表团，今天上午在我国驻朝鲜大使馆临时代办曹克强陪同下到达朝鲜某地欢送中国人民志愿军第三批归国部队先头部队。代表团的成员还有，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱，朝鲜内阁副首相兼外务相南日，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会常务委员会候补委员河仰天、金翊善，地方经理相郑圣彦，朝鲜人民军总参谋长李权武上将，总政治局局长金泰根中将等十二人。
    代表团到达时，受到志愿军第三批归国部队广大官兵的夹道欢迎。
    志愿军政治委员王平上将、副政治委员梁必业中将、参谋长王蕴瑞少将等，也由驻地赶来迎接代表团。
    崔庸健委员长在志愿军首长王平上将和我国驻朝鲜大使馆临时代办曹克强等陪同下检阅了仪仗队。
    新华社平壤12日电  以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健为首的朝鲜党政代表团，今天下午举行盛会欢送中国人民志愿军第三批归国部队。
    参加大会的有志愿军首长王平上将、梁必业中将、王蕴瑞少将和志愿军第三批归国部队某部首长严金生将军与广大官兵代表。
    我国驻朝鲜大使馆临时代办曹克强也参加了大会。
    欢送大会在庄严的朝中两国国歌声中开始。崔庸健委员长首先致欢送词。他说，侵占着中国领土台湾的美帝国主义者，最近更加露骨地对中华人民共和国进行凶恶的挑衅活动，这不仅是对中国人民的侵略行为，而且是对世界和平的安全的直接挑衅。美帝国主义侵略军队必须立即停止对中国人民内政的横暴的武装干涉，必须立即撤出台湾。朝鲜人民全力支援中国人民为国土完整和主权而进行的正义斗争，并且确信中国人民在这个斗争中获得胜利。
    崔庸健说，疯狂地追求战争政策的美帝国主义者，今天在南朝鲜搬进原子武器和火箭武器，使南朝鲜变为美国的原子基地，并唆使李承晚匪帮，掀起
  “北进”骚动。假如帝国主义者们不顾朝中两国人民多次的严重警告和全世界人民的强烈抗议，不停止在远东的战争挑衅，蓄意进行新的侵略战争，那么它们应该深刻地懂得，它们将不可避免的遭到比在朝鲜战争中更加惨重的失败。
    崔庸健在讲话中详细阐述了朝中两国人民牢不可破的国际主义战斗友谊，热烈赞扬中国人民志愿军的伟大国际主义精神和对世界和平事业的巨大贡献与不朽功勋。他说，朝鲜人民怀着无限感谢和友谊之情，在给中国人民志愿军和中国人民的感谢信上签名的已有六百八十二万七千多人。
    崔庸健在热烈的掌声中结束讲话。朝鲜党政代表团代表朴正爱、李权武上将、朴容国等，分别代表朝鲜党政军领导机关和朝鲜民主青年同盟，向志愿军第三批归国部队某部赠送了锦旗。崔庸健和代表团全体代表为志愿军第三批归国部队某部首长佩戴了朝中友谊纪念章。
    志愿军某部首长严金生将军接着致答谢词，感谢朝鲜党政代表团的亲切勉励和送行。他说，中国人民志愿军第三批部队开始撤出朝鲜正处在美帝国主义在远东制造紧张局势的时候，这就和美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚集团的挑衅行动，形成了一个鲜明的对照。这不仅说明了中朝人民对于和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯诚意，而且还充分显示了中朝人民保卫和平制止侵略的无比信心。如果美国侵略者竟敢再次冒险的话，我们可以断言，它必将遭到更加惨重和更加可耻的失败。
    严金生将军感谢朝鲜人民对志愿军无微不至的关怀和全力支援。他说，我们一定把这种崇高的友谊化为战斗的力量，时刻准备着听从祖国的召唤，在敌人一旦敢于发动新的冒险时，给予他们比在朝鲜战场上更加沉重的打击。
    欢送大会结束后，随同代表团前来的艺术团体举行了精采的送别演出。
    欢送大会开始前，崔庸健委员长等曾接见了志愿军第三批归国部队某部高级指挥员。
    新华社平壤12日电　以崔庸健为首的朝鲜党政代表团今天晚上举行盛大宴会，欢送中国人民志愿军第三批归国部队某部官兵代表。
    志愿军政治委员王平上将、副政治委员梁必业中将、参谋长王蕴瑞少将和陪同代表团前来的我国驻朝鲜大使馆临时代办曹克强等应邀出席了宴会。
    崔庸健委员长在宴会开始时讲话。他说，美帝国主义正在露骨地策划扩大对中华人民共和国的侵略，阻碍朝鲜人民的和平统一。朝鲜人民要永远同中国人民站在一起。朝中两国人民一定会把美帝国主义从自己的领土上撵出去。
    志愿军第三批归国部队某部首长唐金龙将军也在宴会上讲话。他说，我们全体官兵怀着依依难舍的心情不久就要离开英雄的朝鲜。我们的心将永远和朝鲜人民连结在一起。海可枯、石可烂，中朝人民以鲜血凝结的战斗友谊将万古常青。
    宴会开始以前，崔庸健委员长等代表金日成首相向第三批归国部队某部首长赠送了礼品。
    新华社平壤12日电　中国人民志愿军第三批归国部队，在密切注视美帝国主义在台湾地区进行战争挑衅，时刻保持高度警惕的同时，大力进行撤军准备工作。
    在“交好、走好、到好”的口号下，各部队都为接防的人民军战友，准备了大量的物资，整修了营房用具，美化了驻地环境。
    同时，各部队利用点滴时间，帮助朝鲜人民生产劳动。某部所属单位帮助驻地农业社，修建了办公室、宣传室或桥梁。某部卫生营为驻地附近两个里，修建了两个保健站和一个兽医站，训练了十一名保健员。某汽车连的官兵，还利用废旧材料帮助农业社修建一座农业工具修理站。
    各部队还组织了许多参观访问小组，到驻地农业社、工厂、学校，学习朝鲜人民的英雄事迹和先进经验。
