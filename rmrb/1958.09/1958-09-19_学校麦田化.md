　　Schools Wheatfield-ized
　　The teachers of Beiguan Street Elementary School in Yidu County, Shandong Province, plan to plant wheat in all the open spaces within the school, ensuring "not an inch is wasted, and not a single stalk is missed." Their slogan is "Schools Wheatfield-ized."
　　This matter makes me think that if all factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, and rural households across the country could plant wheat on all available empty land like this school, the increase in the amount of wheat would be astonishing. Therefore, I propose that a high tide of planting wheat by everyone be launched nationwide by factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, and village households, digging up all vacant land. We should achieve factories and enterprises wheatfield-ized, government offices and schools wheatfield-ized, village households wheatfield-ized, and the whole country everywhere wheatfield-ized. 　　　　Lu Baoyuan

    学校麦田化
    山东省益都县北关街小学的教师们，打算利用校内所有的空地全部种上小麦，做到“寸土不让，一棵不放”。他们提出的口号是“学校麦田化”。
    这个事情使我联想到，如果全国所有的工厂、企业、机关、学校、农村住户都能像这个学校一样，在一切空闲地上种上小麦，那么增加小麦的数量一定是很惊人的。因此，我倡议在全国范围内掀起一个工厂、企业、机关、学校、村庄住户，挖掘一切空地，人人动手种小麦的高潮。达到工厂企业麦田化，机关学校麦田化，村庄住户麦田化，全国到处麦田化。　　　　卢保元
