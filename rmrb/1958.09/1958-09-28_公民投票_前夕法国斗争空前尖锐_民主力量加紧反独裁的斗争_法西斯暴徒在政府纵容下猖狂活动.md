Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 26th: With only two days remaining before the "referendum" that will decide the fate of De Gaulle's dictatorial draft "constitution," the atmosphere of intense struggle currently engulfs the French capital and the rest of the Republic as the propaganda campaigns surrounding this "referendum" conclude with De Gaulle's radio address tonight.

The diverse array of propaganda posters on the streets of Paris profoundly reflects the acuteness of the struggle between democratic and reactionary forces.

The propaganda posters calling on the people to vote "no" are diverse: there are concise summaries of speeches by French Communist Party leaders and other social figures advocating a "no" vote; there are powerful and moving slogans; there are eye-catching, gigantic "NO" characters; and there are leaflets exposing the anti-communist conspiracies of the fascists. The reporter also saw a hand-written, mimeographed article posted by workers, exposing the De Gaulle government's conspiracy to attack workers' rights. Although these posters are often smeared and torn down by fascists, they reappear overnight. This fully reflects the active fighting spirit of the republican and progressive forces of France.

The French Communist Party organizations, "Committees for the Defense of the Republic," and other progressive groups in Paris and throughout the country have been widely organizing small- and medium-sized gatherings, taking advantage of lunch breaks and evenings. Leaders at all levels of the French Communist Party, as well as pro-republic social celebrities, professors, actors, and writers, speak at these gatherings, elucidating the reactionary essence of De Gaulle's new draft "constitution" and mobilizing the people to answer "no." Every district of Paris has held or will hold such gatherings.

In addition, the broad masses of the people are enthusiastically donating to the fund to defend the Republic. According to "l'Humanité," as of today, the people of France nationwide have donated more than 141,770,000 francs.

At the same time, De Gaulle's followers are intensifying their activities, sending people to various factories to conduct deceptive propaganda and attempting to suppress workers' opposition to De Gaulle's draft "constitution."

In the past two days, the bourgeois newspapers have been vigorously proclaiming that De Gaulle will receive about 70% support in the vote, in a vain attempt to psychologically strike those who oppose the new draft "constitution" on the eve of the vote, causing them to lose confidence.

In addition, the De Gaulle government is also intensifying the creation of an atmosphere of terror on the eve of the vote. The persecution of the French Communist Party is becoming increasingly serious throughout the country. In Paris, the reactionary authorities, under the pretext of "maintaining order," have deployed police and gendarmes armed with live ammunition throughout the city; in the dead of night, police cars full of fully armed security police emit ear-piercing wails as they frequently race through the streets, in order to intimidate people.

The authorities announced on the radio on the 25th that the government will take certain measures on the day of the vote on the 28th, but did not reveal the content of these measures. It is pointed out that the measures will certainly include sending police to the polling stations to conduct "surveillance."

Fascists are also openly taking violent and terroristic measures to obstruct the activities of democratic forces. In Sèvres, Seine-et-Oise, late on the night of the 24th, someone threw two burning gasoline bottles at the door of the local Communist Party organization's office. A few days earlier, fascists had already broken into this office and vandalized it.

On the same day, in Clermont-Ferrand, about twenty thugs attacked Republican activists who were posting slogans.

In Nice, two attacks by fascists occurred one after another on the 24th. The first was an attack on the French Communist Party's regional organization in the Bas-de-Las-Plan. The thugs set a fire, causing great damage. The second was when fascist thugs broke into the local Republican Youth League's organization and vandalized it.

"Libération" wrote: "Not a day goes by without hearing news of a building being bombed or a Republican being shot. These methods are reminiscent of the establishment of fascism in Italy and the establishment of Hitlerism in Germany." "Libération" pointed out that the authorities are allowing fascist thugs to go unpunished.

Many newspapers, in their commentaries, emphasized that, judging from the current terroristic means used to deal with democratic organizations, the situation after the new draft "constitution" is passed can be imagined.

### “公民投票”前夕法国斗争空前尖锐  民主力量加紧反独裁的斗争  法西斯暴徒在政府纵容下猖狂活动

    “公民投票”前夕法国斗争空前尖锐
    民主力量加紧反独裁的斗争
    法西斯暴徒在政府纵容下猖狂活动
    据新华社巴黎26日电  离开决定戴高乐的独裁“宪法”草案命运的“公民投票”只有两天了。围绕这次“公民投票”所进行的宣传活动将以戴高乐今晚的广播演说作为结束。紧张斗争的气氛目前正笼罩着法国首都和共和国各地。
    巴黎街头形形色色的宣传招贴深刻反映了民主力量同反动势力之间斗争的尖锐程度。
    号召人民投反对票的宣传招贴是多种多样的：有法国共产党负责人和其他主张投反对票的社会人士讲话的简明摘要；有坚强有力的能打动人心的口号；有引人注目的巨大“不”字；也有揭露法西斯分子反共阴谋的传单。记者还见到有一处贴着工人们用手写油印的文章，揭露了戴高乐政府向职工权利进攻的阴谋。尽管这些招贴往往被法西斯分子涂抹和撕毁，但是一夜之间它们就会又恢复了旧观。这充分反映了法国共和进步力量的积极战斗精神。
    巴黎和全国各地的法国共产党组织、“保卫共和委员会”和其他进步团体连日纷纷利用中午和晚上的时间广泛组织中小型集会，由法国共产党各级负责人以及拥护共和的社会名流、教授、演员和作家等在集会上讲话，阐明戴高乐新“宪法”草案的反动本质，并且动员人民回答“不”。巴黎的每个区都举行了或即将举行这样的集会。
    另外，广大群众也热情捐献保卫共和的基金。据“人道报”报道，到今天为止，法国全国人民已经捐献了一亿四千一百七十七万多法郎。
    在这同时，戴高乐分子也加紧活动，他们派人到各个工厂进行欺骗宣传，并且力图压制工人反对戴高乐“宪法”草案的活动。
    这两天，资产阶级报纸更大肆宣扬戴高乐会在投票中得到70％左右的支持，妄图在投票前夕从心理上打击反对新“宪法”草案的人，使他们丧失信心。
    另外，戴高乐政府在投票前夕也加紧制造恐怖气氛。各地迫害法国共产党的事件日益严重。在巴黎，反动当局也以“维持治安”为名在市内各处布满荷枪实弹的警察和宪兵；夜深人静时，满载全副武装的保安警察的警车发出刺耳怪叫不时驰过街头，借以吓人。
    官方25日在广播中宣布说，在28日投票的当天，政府将采取某些措施，但是没有透露这些措施的内容。据指出，措施中肯定将包括派警察到各选举站去进行“监视”。
    法西斯分子还公然采取暴力和恐怖手段来阻挠民主力量的活动。在塞纳—瓦兹省的塞夫勒，24日深夜有人把两个燃烧着的汽油瓶掷在共产党地方组织办公处的门前。在几天以前，法西斯分子已经破门冲进这个办公处进行了捣毁。
    同一天，在克勒蒙菲朗，有二十来名暴徒袭击张贴标语的共和人士。
    在尼斯城24日一天内也接连发生了两起法西斯分子的袭击。第一次是对法国共产党巴士德地方组织的袭击。暴徒们放了火，造成了很大的损失。第二次是法西斯暴徒冲进了当地共和青年联盟的机构，进行捣毁。
    “解放报”写道：“没有一天不听到某个建筑物遭到爆炸和共和人士遭到射击的消息。这些手段使人回忆起意大利建立法西斯主义和德国建立希特勒主义的时代”。“解放报”指出，当局听任法西斯暴徒逍遥法外。
    许多报纸在评论中都强调指出，从目前对付民主组织的恐怖手段看来，新“宪法”草案一旦通过以后的局面是可以想见的。
