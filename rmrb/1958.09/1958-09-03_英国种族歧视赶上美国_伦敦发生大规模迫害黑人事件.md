    Xinhua News Agency, London, 2nd - News: Large-scale incidents of persecution against Black people have occurred continuously in the London area recently. Groups of racists have been conducting frenzied attacks on Black people.

These thugs shouted "Kill the Blacks!" and committed violence with knives, throwing stones and bottles into the windows of Black people's homes. It is reported that at least three people were stabbed in this attack.
    When forced to retreat, these thugs also threatened: "The attacks will not end unless all the Blacks leave here."

    A few days ago, in Nottingham, one hundred and twenty miles from London, an incident occurred in which one thousand white rioters attacked Black people.

    新华社2日讯　伦敦消息：伦敦地区最近接连发生大规模迫害黑人的事件，种族主义者成群结伙地对黑人进行疯狂袭击。
    8月31日晚间，有五百多名白种人手持刀棒和玻璃瓶子闯进黑人聚居的伦敦诺丁山区。这些暴徒在那里高喊“要杀死黑人”，并且持刀行凶和向黑人住宅的窗子里投掷石头和瓶子。据报道：在这次袭击中至少有三个人受到刀伤。
    这些暴徒在被迫撤离时还扬言：“除非所有的黑人都离开这里，袭击决不结束”。
    在这次袭击以前，8月30日已经有两百名白种人进攻了这个区的黑人。在那次袭击中，暴徒们向黑人的住宅投掷了炸弹。
    前几天，在离伦敦一百二十英里的诺丁汉也发生过一千个白种人暴民袭击黑人的事件。
