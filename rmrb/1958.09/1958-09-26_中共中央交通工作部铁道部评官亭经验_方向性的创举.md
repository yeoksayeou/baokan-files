Xinhua News Agency report: The Guanting People's Commune in Changge County, Henan Province, near the Guanting Station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, has established a transportation army that is both workers and farmers, and also soldiers, loading and unloading when there are trains, carrying when there is cargo, and farming for production when there are no trains or cargo. This approach has had very good results. The CCP Central Communications Work Department and the Ministry of Railways believe that the Guanting Township's experience provides a good organizational form for people's communes to engage in transportation and is also a good way to combine industrial and agricultural production with transportation. It is a directional innovation, embodying the principle of the whole Party and the whole people engaging in transportation.

    中共中央交通工作部铁道部评官亭经验
    方向性的创举
    据新华社讯  河南省长葛县官亭乡人民公社在京汉铁路官亭车站附近，建立了一支亦工亦农亦兵的运输大军，有车就装卸，有货就搬运，无车无货就种田生产。这种作法效果很好。中共中央交通工作部和铁道部认为，官亭乡这个经验为人民公社搞运输提供了一种良好的组织形式，也是工农业生产与运输相结合的好办法，它是一个带方向性的创举，体现了全党全民办交通的方针。
