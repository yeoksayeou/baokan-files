Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, September 24th. Iraqi Republic Prime Minister Qassem told Chinese Ambassador to the Iraqi Republic Chen Zhifang today: The Iraqi government and people support the Chinese people's demands to recover their territory and the struggle for it.

Ambassador Chen Zhifang met with Prime Minister Qassem at noon today. During the conversation, they expressed their mutual desire to strengthen the friendly relations between China and Iraq.

Ambassador Chen Zhifang explained to Prime Minister Qassem the Chinese government's strong attitude towards the U.S. imperialists creating tension in the Taiwan Strait area. Prime Minister Qassem said that the Iraqi and Chinese people are both fighting against imperialism. The Iraqi government and people support the Chinese people's demands to recover their territory and the struggle for it.

This morning, Ambassador Chen Zhifang met with Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamal. During the conversation, Minister Jamal expressed his support for the Chinese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, and he also expressed his support for the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, September 25th. Iraqi Republic Radio published a broadcast commentary on the 23rd, criticizing the United States for delaying its withdrawal of troops from Lebanon and creating tension around the world.

The commentary stated that Dulles' recent speech at the United Nations General Assembly was nothing more than a blatant declaration that the United States insists on pursuing a policy of aggression in the Middle East, the Far East, and other parts of the world. It has been more than a month since the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of invading forces from Lebanon and Jordan, but the imperialists continue to occupy these two Arab countries and are doing everything possible to prolong their occupation, thereby threatening the free Arab nationalist movement.

The commentary stated that the outline of the current situation in the Middle East makes us clearly realize the extent to which the British and American imperialist policies are undermining the United Nations' resolution on the withdrawal of troops from Jordan and Lebanon, and the extent to which the imperialists harbor evil intentions to infringe upon the interests of the people and their legitimate sovereignty. These are all the sins of the imperialists using both hard and soft tactics. This confirms that their ringleader, the United States, was completely forced to agree to the Arab proposal. They did this, on the one hand, to deceive the people and continue their military occupation, distorting parts of the proposal; on the other hand, it was also to re-engage in conspiracy.

The commentary stated that imperialism does not intend to withdraw from the Middle East. Their greed and war mania blind them to the realities of life and the rise of the people and the decline of imperialism. They do not see the consequences they have brought upon themselves in the Middle East or the Taiwan region, and the noose they have tied around their own necks. They disregard the storm of condemnation from people of all countries and the warnings of peace-loving countries, and insist on carrying out dangerous provocations. But contemporary people of insight all know that this dangerous behavior will only lead to the permanent burial of imperialism.

    伊拉克支持中国的正义斗争
    伊拉克电台指出美帝国主义正在埋葬自己
    新华社巴格达24日电  伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆今天对中国驻伊拉克共和国大使陈志方说：伊拉克政府和人民支持中国人民收复他们的领土的要求和为此而进行的斗争。
    陈志方大使今天中午会见了卡塞姆总理，他们在谈话中相互表达了加强中伊两国之间的友好关系的愿望。
    陈志方大使向卡塞姆总理说明了中国政府对美帝国主义者在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势的强烈态度。卡塞姆总理说，伊拉克和中国人民都为反对帝国主义而进行斗争。伊拉克政府和人民支持中国人民收复他们的领土的要求和为此而进行的斗争。
    今天早上，陈志方大使会见了伊拉克外交部长贾迈尔。在交谈中，贾迈尔部长表示支持中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争，他同时表示支持恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位。
    据新华社25日讯  伊拉克共和国电台在23日发表一篇广播评论，抨击美国拖延从黎巴嫩撤军和在世界各地搞紧张局势。
    评论说，杜勒斯最近在联合国大会发表的演说只不过是明目张胆地宣布了美国坚持在中东、远东和世界其他地区奉行侵略政策。联合国大会通过要求侵略军撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的决议已经一个多月了，但是帝国主义者仍然继续占领着这两个阿拉伯国家，并且千方百计地企图使他们的占领长期化，从而威胁自由阿拉伯民族主义运动。
    评论说，中东当前局势的轮廓，使我们清楚地认识到美英帝国主义政策破坏联合国关于从约旦和黎巴嫩撤军决议的程度和帝国主义者包藏祸心企图侵犯人民利益和他们的合法主权的程度。这些都是帝国主义者软硬兼施的罪状。这证实了他们的头子美国完全是被迫而同意了阿拉伯提案的。他们这样做，一方面是为了欺骗人民，继续军事占领，歪曲提案的部分条款；另一方面也是为了重新进行阴谋。
    评论说，帝国主义是不打算从中东地区撤出去的，他们的贪婪和战争狂热使他们闭目不看生活的实际和人民兴起、帝国主义衰亡的实际。他们不看他们在中东或在台湾地区所自招的下场和他们自己套在自己脖子上的绞索。他们不顾各国人民暴风雨般的谴责和爱好和平国家的警告，一意进行危险的挑衅活动。但是当代有识之士，无人不知这种危险的行径只有导致永远埋葬帝国主义而已。
