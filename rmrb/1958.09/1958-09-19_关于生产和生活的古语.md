Old Sayings on Production and Life
	Zifei

	During his inspection of Xushui this time, Comrade Liu Shaoqi gave profound and comprehensive instructions on the layout of local industrial development (see page 2 of the People's Daily, September 18). Comrade Shaoqi quoted a few sentences from the "Four Books," incisively explaining the complexity and importance of production planning. For example, in the distribution of products, when implementing a wage system combining material objects and currency, we must consider all aspects when arranging it. Comrade Shaoqi quoted Mencius's saying: "Moreover, one person's body requires the provision of various kinds of labor." This sentence comes from Mencius's "Teng Wengong Chapter," and is the conclusion after Mencius's debate with Chen Xiang. It means that one person's life needs are satisfied by the supply of various products. Just as he questioned Chen Xiang in the preceding text: Of all the things you wear, eat, and use for farming and making tools, which one is made by yourself, and not supplied by others?

	Regarding stepping up production and accumulating capital, Comrade Shaoqi also quoted a few sentences from the "Great Learning" (also found in the "Book of Rites"): "Let there be a great number of producers, and let there be few consumers. Let there be activity in the production, and economy in the expenditure. Then there will be a constant abundance of wealth." That is to say, the more people producing the better, the fewer people consuming the better, the faster the work the better, and the more frugal the spending the better. If this is the case, our wealth will always be abundant. These words basically conform to today's spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical, which is how to try to minimize non-productive personnel and shorten non-productive time as much as possible. Comrade Shaoqi readily quoted these words to powerfully illustrate the current problems. This is very enlightening for us.

    关于生产和生活的古语
    知非
    这次刘少奇同志视察徐水，对当地的工业发展的布局作了深刻而全面的指示（见9月18日人民日报2版）。少奇同志引了“四书”上的几句话，精辟地说明了生产规划的复杂性和重要性。如在产品分配上，要实行实物加货币的工资时，在安排的时候要从各方面去考虑。少奇同志引了孟子一句话：“且一人之身而百工之所为备”。这句话见于孟子“滕文公章，是孟子和陈相争辩后的结论。意思是说一个人的生活所需，是要各种各样的产品来供应，方能满足。正如他在这句话的上文中质问陈相说的：凡你们穿的戴的、作饭的耕田的一切用物器械等等，那一件是自己制造的，而不是别人供给的呢？
    对于加劲生产、积累资金，少奇同志又引了“大学”（也见于“礼记”）中几句话：“生之者众，食之者寡，为之者疾，用之者舒，则财恒足矣。”就是说生产的人越多越好，消费的人越少越好，工作起来越快越好，花钱的时候越省越好，果然如此，则我们的财富永远是充裕的。这些话基本上合乎今天多快好省的精神，也就是如何设法使非生产的人员尽量减少，使非生产的时间尽量缩短。少奇同志顺手把这些话引来，强有力地说明当前的问题。这是对我们很有启发的。
