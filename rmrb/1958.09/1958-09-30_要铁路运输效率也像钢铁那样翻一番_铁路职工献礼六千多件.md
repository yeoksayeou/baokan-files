    Railway Transportation Efficiency Should Double Like Steel
    Railway Workers Offer Over Six Thousand Gifts
    The national railway sector workers held a "National Day" gift-giving conference today, offering over six thousand precious gifts to the Party and the country.
    Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo attended the conference to accept the gifts and delivered a speech. He encouraged everyone to continue to emancipate their minds, break down superstitions, work hard to change the tense situation of railway transportation, strive to load more cars and transport more goods, and welcome an even greater leap forward in 1959.
    The central venue for the gift-giving conference was located in the square of the Beijing Railway Institute, with 20,000 representatives from various lines participating in today's conference. The conference also used the railway system's dedicated telephone to broadcast the proceedings to railway workers across the country.
    At 9:00 a.m., after the conference was declared open amidst the music of singing about the motherland, two railway workers carried a large red gift-giving sign with the words "5,510,288 pieces" written on it to the rostrum. This number represents the total number of inventions and rationalization proposals made by railway workers across the country during the Great Leap Forward. Today, they brought more than six thousand major projects to Beijing as gifts to the Party and the country. Among these six thousand gifts, one hundred and forty are major technological achievements or new products that have reached international levels. For example, the "Giant Dragon" type double-section diesel locomotive with 4,000 horsepower successfully trial-produced by the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant can pull a freight train with a load of 3,500 tons at a time, and its efficiency is three times higher than that of a steam locomotive. The advanced experience of polarity frequency dispatching centralization created by the Electrical Design Institute of the Electrical Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Railways allows a dispatcher to control a line of 100 to 200 kilometers, eliminating the need for switch operators at stations, and increasing the passing capacity of the line by 40%. The nodular cast iron axle tiles created by the workers of the Puzhen Railway Repair Factory of the Ministry of Railways, if used on all existing vehicles, could save the country more than 6,000 tons of copper a year.
    In their speeches at the meeting, representatives of various delegations unanimously stated that they would never be satisfied with the achievements they had made. In the future, they would continue to work hard, resolutely overcome all difficulties, make greater achievements, and launch more "satellites" to respond to the Party and the country's kind concern and earnest expectations for railway workers.
    Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan also spoke at the meeting. He congratulated all railway workers on behalf of the Ministry of Railways and the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union. He pointed out that in the current situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the task facing the railway sector is to be a good "pioneer," so that the transportation efficiency of the railway can also double like steel and grain, and pave the way for the "Marshal." He demanded that all 1.3 million railway workers must, under the leadership of the Party, work hard, diligently, and skillfully, to ensure that trains do not stop, every second counts, goods do not stay, and every ounce is not suppressed, and strive to load an average of 45,000 cars per day in the fourth quarter, and strive to complete the construction of 6,000 kilometers of railway subgrade this year.

    要铁路运输效率也像钢铁那样翻一番
    铁路职工献礼六千多件
    据新华社29日讯  全国铁路部门职工今天举行“十一”献礼大会，向党和国家献出了六千多件珍贵的礼品。
    国务院副总理薄一波出席大会接受了献礼，并且讲了话。他勉励大家要继续解放思想破除迷信，努力改变铁路运输的紧张状况，争取多装车、多运货，迎接1959年更大的跃进。
    献礼大会的中心会场设在北京铁道学院的广场上，有二万名来自各条线路上的代表参加了今天的大会。大会并利用铁路系统的专用电话向全路职工转播了大会的实况。
    上午九时，当大会在歌唱祖国的音乐声中宣布开幕以后，就有二名铁路职工抬着写有“五百五十一万零二百八十八件”字样的红色大献礼牌走上了主席台。这个数字代表着全路职工在大跃进中的创造发明和合理化建议的总数。今天，他们把其中的六千多件重大项目拿到北京来作为向党和国家的献礼。在这六千多件礼品中，有一百四十项是已经达到国际水平的重大技术成就或新产品。如大连机车车辆制造厂试制成功的四千马力的巨龙型双节内燃机车，一次可拉载重三千五百吨的货车，效率要比蒸气机车提高三倍。铁道部电务局电务设计所创造的极性频率调度集中的先进经验，一、二百公里长的线路只要一个调度员就能控制，车站上不用扳道员，线路的通过能力也可以提高40％。铁道部浦镇铁路修理工厂职工创造的球墨铸铁轴瓦，如在现有的全部车辆上使用，一年就可以为国家节约六千多吨铜。
    各个代表团的代表在会上致词中，一致表示，他们绝不满足于已经取得的成就，今后要再接再厉，坚决排除一切困难，作出更大的成绩，放出更多的“卫星”，来回答党和国家对铁路职工的亲切关怀和殷切期望。
    铁道部部长滕代远也在会上讲话。他代表铁道部和铁路工会全国委员会向全路职工祝贺。他指出，在当前工农业大跃进的形势下，铁路部门面临的任务是要当好“先行官”，使铁路的运输效率也像钢铁和粮食一样翻一番，为“元帅”开路。他要求全路一百三十万职工必须在党的领导下，猛干、苦干、巧干，做到车不停驶、分秒必争，货不停留、斤两不压，为争取第四季度每日平均装车四万五千车而奋斗，为今年修好六千公里铁路路基而奋斗。
