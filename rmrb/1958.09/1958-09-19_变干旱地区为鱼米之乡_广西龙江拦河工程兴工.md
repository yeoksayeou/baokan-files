Transforming Arid Areas into Lands of Fish and Rice
Construction Begins on Guangxi's Longjiang River Dam Project

    (Our report) Nanning – A magnificent water conservancy project in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Longjiang River Dam Project, recently broke ground in Lailang Township, Yishan County. Upon completion, this project will completely eliminate drought for 2.5 million mu of farmland along both sides of the river, transforming the area into a land of fish and rice.
    The transformation of the Longjiang River will be carried out through a cascade development approach, requiring the construction of two large dams on the river. One dam will be located in Lailang Township, Yishan County, with a height of 23 meters and a water intake of 50 cubic meters per second. The canal will be 800 kilometers long, irrigating 2 million mu of land. This phase of the project is scheduled for completion by the end of March next year. The other dam will be located in Laocun Township, Libo County, Guizhou Province, with a height of 28 meters and a canal length of 350 kilometers, irrigating 500,000 mu. This phase is scheduled for completion before the spring plowing of 1960. In addition, it will be necessary to tunnel through ten thousand steep rocky mountains, excavating thirty-five tunnels with a total length of thirteen kilometers; to erect a 50-meter-high double-decker aqueduct over the surging Hongshui River; and to establish a large reservoir with a storage capacity of 4 billion cubic meters in Huanjiang County. The entire project will require the excavation and blasting of 100 million cubic meters of earth and stone, requiring 100 million workdays.

    变干旱地区为鱼米之乡
    广西龙江拦河工程兴工
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区一座宏伟的水利工程——龙江拦河工程，不久前在宜山县拉浪乡破土兴工。这一工程建成后，将使沿江两岸二百五十万亩田地彻底消除旱灾，一跃成为鱼米之乡。
    改造龙江工程将采取梯级开发的办法，要修两座拦江大坝。一座大坝在宜山县拉浪乡，高二十三公尺，引水量五十秒公方，渠道长八百公里，灌溉二百万亩。这段工程要求在明年3月底完成。另一座大坝在贵州省荔波县捞村乡，高二十八公尺，渠道长三百五十公里，灌溉五十万亩。这段工程要求在1960年春耕前完成。此外，还需穿通万座险峻石山，开凿三十五个共长十三公里的隧洞；在汹涌澎湃的红水河上新架一座高五十公尺的双层渡槽；在环江县建立一个储水四十亿公方的大水库。整个工程共需挖炸土石一亿方，需一亿个工日。
