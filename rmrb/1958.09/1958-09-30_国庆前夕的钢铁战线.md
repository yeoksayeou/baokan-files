Xinhua News Agency, 29th: On the steel front on the eve of National Day, in order to complete the glorious and arduous task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year, the tens of millions of steelworkers across the country are fighting day and night without rest or stopping their furnaces. What follows are reports from the hot steelmaking and ironmaking sites across the country by our reporters. It is only a microcosm of the fierce battle on the national steel front. However, readers can see how, in the steel capital of Anshan, molten steel continuously flows from powerful, modern steelmaking furnaces; see how the workers of the Shanghai Red Flag Steel Plant are intensely producing dazzling sparks of steel; see the scene of the people of Henan and Guizhou fighting at their blast furnace clusters at night; and see the heroic spirit of the people of Jinggangshan and the Lunan Mountains producing and transporting supplies for the steel marshal with soaring enthusiasm.

Anshan's Flowing Steel

    The flame of brilliant communist ideology burns ever brighter in the hearts of the people of the steel capital of Anshan, and the golden, glittering molten steel overflows more and more with each passing moment. By 3:30 PM, the steel produced by the workers in the first two shifts today was more than what was produced by three shifts in the past. Immediately afterward, the steel warriors of the last shift launched a new offensive, determined to release an even larger bumper "satellite" together with the previous two shifts of workers to welcome the great National Day.

    When the night was deep and there was still more than an hour before the new day, a moving scene appeared beside the rows of black steelmaking furnaces emitting red flames in this large steel base. The workers of the previous shift were still working intensely, and the workers of the next shift excitedly started their work ahead of schedule. However, when the new day began at midnight, the steelworkers of the previous shift forgot the fatigue of the day, without even taking the time to wipe their sweat, and continued to fight. Time was flying by, and the battle was becoming increasingly intense. By 11:00 AM, an even more moving scene of a "three-shift grand meeting" appeared in various steel plants. It turned out that many workers who should have gotten off work at midnight had been working continuously for nearly twenty or more hours without going home, while many workers who were supposed to start work at 4:00 PM in the afternoon came to join the previous shift five or more hours early.

    On this day, the sparks of communist ideology shone in every plant and on every open-hearth furnace. The workers of the First Steel Plant broke with convention and used the newly successfully tested "mixed carburization method" to increase steel production. The Second Steel Plant, which originally dared not implement four-ladle tapping, boldly implemented it on two open-hearth furnaces today, casting ninety tons more steel per furnace.

    Hundreds of tons of molten steel, furnace after furnace, like dragons emerging from the sea, rolled and roared, rushing from the hearth to the ten-foot-high large steel ladle. When the first furnace of molten steel was poured out from an open-hearth furnace in the Second Steel Plant at 12:30 AM today, only a few minutes later, an open-hearth furnace in the First Steel Plant spewed out hundreds of tons of molten steel. However, in less than half an hour, the two steel plants simultaneously poured out two furnaces of molten steel; after more than ten minutes, six open-hearth furnaces in several steel plants almost simultaneously tapped steel.

Night Battle at the Blast Furnace Clusters

    On the night of the 27th, the tens of thousands of indigenous blast furnace clusters in Henan Province burned fiercely all night, the firelight reddening the night sky.

    This night was the sixteenth night of the Youth Dongfeng Iron Smelting Plant of the Yuxian Heroic People's Commune, fighting for steel, fighting for every second, fighting for every ounce. When night had just fallen, a light rain began to fall. The workers, fearing that the rain would make the road slippery, transported enough ore and coke for fifteen days to the front of the furnace. Fu Jiang, a twenty-three-year-old young worker, joined the Communist Party three days ago on the steel front. He had not slept for four days and four nights, but he worked with particular vigor when transporting ore; he carried two loads when others carried one. He said: I would rather collapse than let the furnace stop! At the Communist Youth No. 2 furnace, the reporter saw a young man crawl his entire upper body into the furnace to repair it. His name is Li Dongfang, a well-known ironmaking expert in Yuxian. Before Yuxian launched its first satellite, he and his father, Li Tianxiang, created a hydraulic automatic blast furnace. The father and son had been fighting for six days and six nights. Others repeatedly persuaded them to rest, but Li Dongfang insisted on not resting and continued to fight until 3:00 AM. The furnace was repaired, and it was immediately ignited. By dawn, another furnace of molten iron had flowed out.

    At dawn, the workers beat on iron blocks with a clang, cheering and singing about their nighttime harvest. On this night, the Communist Youth No. 3 and No. 4 furnaces together smelted more than 2,000 catties of pig iron.

    On the same night, the bright moonlight shone on Lou Mountain Pass, where the Red Army fought a bloody battle. Here, more than 200 male and female commune members from the Red Star People's Commune in Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, set up a challenge arena and were engaged in a night battle to produce 20 tons of pig iron per day.

    At the ironworks built here, the flames soared into the sky, and the singing was loud: The red flag flies high on the mountain, and commune members refine treasure on the hillside. Hundreds of blast furnaces are built, and molten iron flows and steel sparks shine!

    The high-yield red flag has already been planted on the Dong Cunrui Iron Smelting Furnace, but the young men on the other iron smelting furnaces are not willing to give up and are determined to seize the red flag. Beside the scorching indigenous blast furnace, Cai Huayun, a volunteer soldier who had recently returned from abroad, was scooping slag and tapping iron with an iron hook, his arms bare. He said that the current charge was only changing the submachine gun to a large iron hook. Wang Meizhen, a fifteen-year-old girl who was in charge of the bellows, said proudly: This blast furnace was put into production only yesterday, and today it has produced hundreds of catties of iron. When several reporters who came to interview her teased her for being a child, she retorted unconvincingly: Attacking steel does not fear being small. I work the same as adults. As she spoke, she twisted a reporter to pull the bellows to compare who was better. An old man with a full beard laughed heartily and said unceremoniously: Producing more steel to support the liberation of Taiwan is the responsibility of men, women, old, and young. Whoever looks down on people here will not be welcomed!

    The moon slowly fell to the horizon, and the sun dispelled the night. However, the battle for iron and the race to seize the red flag by male and female commune members are still going on fiercely.

On the Steel Transportation Line

    The people of the old revolutionary base area in the Lunan Mountains of Shandong Province, who have a glorious history of supporting the front, have once again launched a upsurge of transporting supplies for the steel industry with the same vigor as they supported the Huaihai Campaign. At present, 700,000 people and 100,000 large and small vehicles in twelve counties of the Linyi area have been put into the steel transportation line, transporting ore and coke for the steel marshal day and night.

    On the 27th and 28th, the reporter traveled by motorcycle through the Lunan area and saw that all the highways and avenues were crowded with people. On the roads leading to iron ore, coal mines, coking, and iron smelting bases, cars, horse-drawn carts, ox carts, handcarts, and tricycles surged forward side by side during the day, and the crowds of people carrying loads on their shoulders rubbed arms and followed closely behind; at night, the lights crawled on the roads, looking like huge fire dragons crawling from afar.

    In the early winter season ten years ago, a great scene of bustling traffic and tens of thousands of troops and horses also appeared on the highway from Linyi City to Xuzhou, Zaozhuang, and Xin Hailian; however, at that time, what people were transporting was not ore, but a large amount of ammunition and food to support the Huaihai Campaign. Now, the busy situation on these roads surpasses the situation on the eve of the Huaihai Campaign. The reporter encountered 40,000 to 50,000 migrant workers transporting ore and coke on a section of highway only a dozen kilometers long from Zaozhuang to Yixian City. Some pushed with cars, others carried them on their shoulders, and they rushed to the small blast furnace clusters. In Lanling and Cangxian, countless vehicles transporting ore and crowds of people carrying loads on their shoulders have formed a long snake formation that continues day and night.

    Those heroes who supported the front in the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War are now leading the masses to engage in the battle of transporting grain for the steel commander. Chen Zhaoyuan, who once served as the battalion commander of the support-the-front migrant workers, is now the commander of the Linyi County Transportation Command. He commands more than 30,000 large and small vehicles and more than 100,000 migrant workers in the county day and night to transport grain for the steel commander. In recent months, although the comrades of the command have only slept for two or three hours a day, everyone has no signs of fatigue under the encouragement of supporting the steel commander to quickly raise his account. Under the soaring enthusiasm of the people of the county, from September 1st to 28th, they transported more than 40,000 tons of ore, coke, and other materials to the side of the iron smelting furnace.

Wuhan Steel's Sunday

    The 28th was Sunday, also the fifteenth day that Wuhan Steel's No. 1 blast furnace was put into production. While people were happily spending their weekly holiday, the workers of Fan Zhekuan's team arrived at the blast furnace one hour early to start the night shift.

    These young steel warriors were in particularly high spirits today. At the meeting in the afternoon, they expressed that they would increase the daily output of the blast furnace from more than 1,000 tons to 2,000 tons in the next few days to welcome National Day.

    Tense labor began, and everyone was holding fast to their posts. Furnace foreman Xu Hongyu was busy with nine team members. Xu Hongyu had just come out of the hospital. The doctor wanted him to rest for a few more days, but he liked to return to the blast furnace to exercise. Worker Pan Xujian was not feeling well today. The foreman wanted him to go back, but he said: Everyone is working hard, what does my little problem count for! The gas workers and piping workers were also never idle. Piping worker Wei Enzhong constantly walked around the blast furnace platform with a flashlight, just as they often said, "We must protect the cooling equipment on the blast furnace as if we were protecting our own eyeballs." The hard work of the blast furnace workers finally achieved good results. Four furnaces of molten iron were successfully poured out in their shift, and the output was close to 2,000 tons per day.

    The morning brought even greater strength to the people. The first to arrive at the ironworks was Deputy Director Zhou Chuandian. After he understood the production situation of the night shift, he proposed that under normal production conditions, the amount of ore and coke could be appropriately increased, so that eleven tons more iron could be produced per hour. Then, Director Xie Jian and Technician Li Fengen also came. Like the workers, they had been living in the ironworks for more than a month, personally directing the battle to seize molten iron.

The Red Flag Steel Plant's Good News

    The open-hearth furnace workshop of the Shanghai Third Steel Plant, which holds the national red flag for high output of open-hearth furnaces, continued to maintain its high output record in the twenty-four hours from yesterday afternoon to today afternoon. On this day, the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces in the entire workshop reached as high as seventeen tons, and the steel output was 26.4% higher than the average daily output in the previous twenty-six days.

    Today, a tense and moving scene appeared in the workshop. Red flags fluttered and drums rumbled at the entrance of the workshop. At 2:00 PM, as soon as a furnace of steel from the No. 1 open-hearth furnace was released, the workers of Yu Honghai's group of Class C immediately took over and charged materials, some shoveling scrap steel into the mouth of the furnace with shovels, and some grabbing scrap steel and throwing it in without even using shovels. Everyone was drenched in sweat, soaking their clothes. From laying the furnace and charging materials to firing the materials, it only took one hour and eleven minutes, about thirty minutes shorter than usual.

    The loudspeaker in the workshop dispatch room directed the battle of the entire workshop, and the duty director, dispatcher, and thermal engineers watched the changes in front of the furnace intently. If the gas supply was insufficient and the flame in the open-hearth furnace was not bright enough, they shouted loudly on the loudspeaker: Gas team workers pay attention! You must cooperate with the front of the furnace to fight! The workers next to the gas furnace immediately opened the gas supply. The dispatcher told the workers how long each furnace of steel had been smelted on the loudspeaker at any time, encouraging everyone to work harder.

    The furnace output in the open-hearth furnace workshop has continuously risen from twenty-eight tons to thirty-two tons and thirty-four tons this month. In order to create higher daily output and new records for the utilization coefficient on the eve of National Day, the workers made new deployments this afternoon. They sharpened their fists and wiped their palms, full of energy, ready to break their own highest record of the 21.2-ton open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient created on the 18th and hold the red flag even higher.

Great Battle in Jinggangshan

    On the eve of National Day, in the deep mountains and steep peaks of the Jinggang Mountains, which stretch for hundreds of miles, the sound of artillery fire shook the sky day and night, and the sound of hammers echoed. More than 120,000 steelworkers are engaged in tense labor to mine ore here.

    The Ji'an area at the foot of the Jinggang Mountains has built more than 6,600 iron smelting furnaces, and iron smelting and mining have become the most intense activities for the people of the old revolutionary base area in the Jinggang Mountains. Whether it is an old man with white hair or a child of a few years old, whether it is a worker, farmer, woman, or cadre, they have all picked up hammers and baskets and rushed to the mountains. The 27th was the Mid-Autumn Festival. According to the customs of the farmers here, on this day, families should reunite and celebrate the festival. However, on this day, before dawn, mining armies from all walks of life came to the mountains, and at night, the lights shone, and the sound of explosions continued all night. On Wushi Mountain, the foot of the farmer Yin Shuifa was bloodied by a stone this day, and the tiger's mouth of both hands was cracked by the shock. People persuaded him to go down the mountain to rest. He smiled, then tore open his headscarf, bandaged the wound, and continued to work.

    Although it rained continuously in many places, the mining armies fighting on the mountains were still full of fighting spirit. They braved the autumn wind and autumn rain and held their ground. Shi Xuegou, a fifty-six-year-old old man in Wushi Mountain, Yongxin County, who had served as a Red Army soldier thirty years ago, also worked hard on the mountain with everyone. Seeing that the working conditions were becoming more and more difficult, people persuaded him to go down the mountain to rest, but he resolutely refused. He said: What does it matter to be a little bitter in socialist construction? It was really bitter when the Kuomintang oppressed us in the past. Now, making steel is for a good life in the future.

    As a result of the soaring enthusiasm of the mining armies from all walks of life, more than 720,000 tons of ore have now been reserved for the iron smelting furnace.

    国庆前夕的钢铁战线
    新华社29日讯  在国庆前夕的钢铁战线上，为了完成今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的光荣而艰巨的任务，全国几千万钢铁大军不歇兵、不停炉地日夜酣战。下面就是本社记者从各地火热的炼钢炼铁现场上发出的报道。它只不过是全国钢铁战线酣战情景的一个缩写。但是，读者们从这里可以看到在钢都鞍山，钢水如何从威力巨大的现代化炼钢炉里源源不断地向外奔流着：看到上海红旗钢厂的职工，如何紧张地放射着耀人眼目的钢花；看到河南和贵州人民夜战高炉群的情景；看到井冈山和鲁南山区人民，以冲天干劲为钢铁元帅生产和运送粮饷的英雄气概。
    鞍山钢水奔腾
    光芒万丈的共产主义思想的火焰，在钢都鞍山人们的心中越烧越旺，金花灿烂的钢水，也一次次越出越多。到下午三点半为止，工人们今天在头两个班内炼出的钢，就比往日三个班增产的还多。紧接着，最后一班的钢铁战士们展开新的攻势，决心同前两班工人一起，放出一个更大的丰产“卫星”，来迎接伟大的国庆节。
    当夜色正浓、离开新的一天还有一个多小时的时候，在这个大钢铁基地黑压压的一排排吐射着红色火舌的炼钢炉旁，就出现了一幅动人的景象。上一班工人还在紧张的操作，下一班工人就兴冲冲地提前开始了工作。可是当午夜零点新的一天开始的时候，上一班的炼钢工人们却忘记了一天的疲劳，连汗水也没有顾得擦，就继续战斗下去。时间在飞速地前进，战斗也越来越紧张。到了上午十一点钟，在各炼钢厂里又出现了“三班大会师”的更加动人的场面。原来，在午夜零点应该下班的许多工人连续干了将近二十多小时还没有回去，而本来应该在下午四点上班的工人，有许多人提前了五个多小时来参加上一班的工作。
    这一天，无论在哪个厂，哪座平炉上，都闪耀着共产主义思想的火花。第一炼钢厂的工人们打破陈规，运用了刚刚试验成功的“混合增炭法”，增加了钢的产量，第二炼钢厂原来不敢实行的四罐出钢，今天也大胆地在两座平炉上实行了，每个炉子多铸了九十吨钢。
    几百吨几百吨的钢水一炉接着一炉，像蛟龙出海一般，滚腾咆哮，从炉膛一下奔向一丈高的大钢水罐。当今天第一炉钢水在午夜零时三十分钟从第二炼钢厂的一座平炉里倾泻出来以后，仅隔几分钟，第一炼钢厂的一座平炉又吐出了几百吨钢水。但是不到半小时，这两个钢厂就同时吐出两炉钢水；隔了十几分钟，在几个炼钢厂里又有六个平炉几乎同时出钢。
    夜战高炉群
    27日的夜晚，河南省成千上万的土高炉群彻夜火焰熊熊，火光映红了夜空。
    这一夜，是禹县英雄人民公社青年东风炼铁厂分秒必争、斤两必争、为钢铁奋战的第十六个夜。当夜幕刚刚降临，落起了一阵小雨。工人们怕雨下大了路滑不好走，就把足供十五天用的矿石、焦炭运到炉前。二十三岁的青年工人傅江三天以前在钢铁战线上参加了共产党。他已经四天四夜没有睡觉了，但是在运矿石的时候干得特别有劲；别人挑一担，他挑两担。他说：宁肯人累倒，也不能叫炉子停住！在共青二号炉，记者看到一个青年小伙子把整个上身钻进炉子里，在那里修理炉子。他叫李东方，是这个厂的有名的炼铁能手，在禹县放出第一个卫星以前，他和他的父亲李天祥创造了水力自动吹风高炉。他们父子二人已经战斗了六天六夜，别人再三地劝他们休息，但是李东方却坚持不休息，一直战斗到下半夜三点钟。炉子修理好了，马上点火，到天亮的时候又流出了一炉铁水。
    天亮了，工人们敲打着铁块当当地响，欢呼和歌唱着他们夜战的丰收。在今天夜里，共青三号炉和四号炉两个炉子，共炼出生铁二千多斤。
    在同一个夜晚，皎洁的月光照耀着红军血战过的娄山关。在这里，贵州省遵义县二百多个红星人民公社的男女社员们摆开擂台，正在为日产二十吨生铁展开夜战。
    建设在这里的炼铁厂里，火焰冲天，歌声宏亮：高高山上红旗飘，社员炼宝在山腰。高炉建起千百座，铁水奔流钢花耀！
    高产红旗已经插到董存瑞号炼铁炉上了，但是别的炼铁炉上小伙子很不甘心，立志要把红旗夺过来。在火焰逼人的土高炉旁，回国不久的志愿军战士蔡华云赤着胳膊，紧握着铁勾捞渣出铁。他说现在的冲锋陷阵，只是把冲锋枪换成了大铁勾。十五岁的姑娘风箱手王美珍，骄傲地说：这个高炉昨天才投入生产，今天就出了几百斤铁。当几个来采访的记者逗她说是个小孩的时候，她却不服气地反驳道：“突击钢铁不怕小，我同大人一样干”，说着她就把一位记者扭去拉风箱，要比一下高低。一个满面胡须的老大爷哈哈地笑了起来，他不客气地说：多产钢铁支援解放台湾，男女老幼都有分，在这里谁要看不起人，谁就不会受欢迎！
    月亮慢慢地落下地平，太阳驱散了夜幕。但是，男女社员们向时间要铁的战斗和夺红旗的竞赛，依然在火热地进行着。
    在钢铁运输线上
    有着光荣支前历史的山东鲁南山区老根据地人民，今天又以当年支援淮海战役的劲头掀起了为钢铁工业运输粮饷的热潮。现在，临沂专区十二个县有七十万人，十万辆大、小车，投入了钢铁运输线，日夜为钢铁元帅运送矿石和焦炭。
  27和28日，记者乘摩托车穿越鲁南地区，看到所有的公路和大道上都是人山人海。在通往铁矿，煤矿、炼焦和炼铁基地的道路上，白天汽车、马车、牛车、手推车、三轮车并排汹涌前进，肩挑的人群磨臂接踵；夜晚，条条道路上蠕动着灯光，远远看去好似巨大的火龙在爬行。
    十年前的初冬季节，从临沂城通往徐州、枣庄和新海连等地的公路上，也呈现着一片车水马龙、千军万马的伟大场面；不过，那时人们运送的不是矿石，而是支援淮海战役的大宗弹药和粮食。现在，这几条大路上的繁忙景况，却胜过了当年淮海大战前夕的景况。记者在枣庄——峄县城仅十几公里的一段公路上，就碰到四、五万名运输矿石、焦炭的民工，他们有的用车推，有的肩挑，争先恐后地向小高炉群奔去。在兰陵和苍县，运输矿石的无数车辆和肩挑人群，已排成了昼夜不断的长蛇阵。
    在抗日和解放战争中那些支前的英雄，今天又带领着广大群众投入了为钢帅运送粮食的战斗。曾经干过支前民工营营长的陈兆元，现在是临沂县运输指挥部的指挥，他夜以继日指挥着全县的三万多辆大车、小车和十多万民工为钢帅运粮。近月以来，指挥部的同志虽然每天只睡两三个小时，但大家在支援钢帅快升帐的鼓舞下，却毫无倦容。在全县人民冲天的干劲下，从9月1日至28日就把四万多吨矿石、焦炭等运到了炼铁炉旁。
    武钢的星期天
    28日是星期天，也是武钢一号高炉投入生产的第十五天。当人们愉快地度着每周的假日时，樊哲宽班的工人却提前一小时赶到高炉来上夜班了。
    这些年青的钢铁战士，今天劲头特别足。还在下午的会议上，他们就表示：要在最近几天把高炉的日产量由一千多吨提高到二千吨，以此来迎接国庆节。
    紧张的劳动开始了，各人都坚守在自己的岗位上，炉前组长徐洪余正和九个组员一起忙碌着。徐洪余是刚从医院出来的，医生要他多休息几天，但他却喜欢回到高炉来“锻炼身体”。工人潘绪俭今天有些不大舒服，工长要他回去，他说：“大家都在苦干，我这点小毛病又算得了什么！”煤气工和配管工也都一刻不闲着。配管工魏恩忠不时地拿着手电筒围着高炉平台转，正像他们经常说的“要像看护自己眼珠一样爱护高炉上的冷却设备”。高炉工人们的苦战终于取得了良好的成绩，在他们这一班里顺利地流出了四炉铁水，产量接近于日产二千吨。
    早晨，给人们带来了更大的力量。最早来到炼铁厂的是副厂长周传典，他了解了夜班的生产情况后，就提出在正常的生产情况下，可以适当地增加矿石和焦炭的数量，这样每小时就可以多出十一吨铁。接着谢健厂长和李凤恩技师也来了。他们与工人一样，一个多月来一直住在炼铁厂里，亲自指挥着争夺铁水的战斗。
    红旗钢厂的捷报
    高举全国平炉高产红旗的上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间，在昨天下午到今天下午的二十四小时里，继续保持了高产纪录。这一天里，全车间的平炉利用系数高达十七吨，钢的产量比前二十六天平均日产量高出26.4％。
    今天车间里出现了一幅紧张动人的画景。车间门口红旗招展，鼓声隆隆。下午二点，一号平炉一炉钢刚刚放掉，丙班郁洪海小组工人马上接上去进料，有些人用铁铲把废钢一铲铲地往炉子口送，有些人连铁铲也不用将手抓起废钢就扔。个个汗水直流，浸透衣襟。从铺炉、进料到烧料，只花了一小时十一分钟，比通常缩短三十分钟左右。
    车间调度室的喇叭，指挥着全车间的战斗，值班主任、调度员、热工们紧张地注视着炉前的变化。煤气供应不足，平炉里火焰不够亮，他们就在喇叭里高喊：煤气小组工人注意！你们要配合炉前一起战斗呀！煤气炉旁的工人马上把煤气开大。调度员在喇叭里随时把每炉钢已经炼了多少时间告诉工人，鼓动大家加油干。
    平炉车间这个月来炉产量已从二十八吨接连上升到三十二吨、三十四吨。工人们为了在国庆前夕创造更高的日产量和利用系数新纪录，今天下午又作了新的部署。他们磨拳擦掌，精神焕发，准备打破18日他们自己所创造的二十一·二吨的平炉利用系数最高纪录，把红旗举得更高。
    大战井冈山
    国庆前夕，在纵横数百里的井冈山区的深山峻岭中，白天黑夜炮声惊天，锤声动地，十二万多人的钢铁大军在这里展开了采掘矿石的紧张劳动。
    井冈山下的吉安专区已建成六千六百多座炼铁炉，炼铁采矿成了井冈山区革命老根据地人民最紧张的活动。不论是白发老人或几岁的孩子，不论是工人、农民、妇女、干部，都拿起了铁锤筐子奔向山头。27日是中秋节，按照这里农民的风俗，这一天都要合家团聚，欢度节日。可是这一天天还没有亮，各路采矿大军就来到了山上，晚上灯火照耀，爆破声仍彻夜不停。在乌石山上，农民尹水发的脚这一天被石头砸出了血，双手的虎口被震裂了，人们劝他下山休息，他笑了一笑，然后把头巾撕开，包扎好伤口又干了起来。
    尽管许多地方阴雨连绵，可是战斗在山头上的采矿大军仍旧斗志高昂。他们冒着秋风秋雨，坚守阵地。永新县乌石山上一位三十年前曾经当过红军的五十六岁老人史雪狗，也同大家一道起劲地工作在山头。人们看到工作条件越来越艰苦，劝他下山去休息，他坚决不答应，他说：“搞社会主义建设苦一点算得什么，过去国民党压迫我们才真是苦，现在搞钢铁就是为了将来的好生活。”
    各路采矿大军以冲天干劲劳动的结果，现在已经为炼铁炉储备好了七十二万多吨矿石。
