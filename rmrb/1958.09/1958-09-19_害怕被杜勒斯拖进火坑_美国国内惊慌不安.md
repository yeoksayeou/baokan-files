Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 17th: The U.S. ruling group's policy of military provocation in the Taiwan area is facing increasingly strong opposition from various circles and public opinion at home and abroad.

    Senator Morse Says
    Dulles is Deceiving the American People
    Democratic Senator Morse published an article in "The Nation" magazine, criticizing Secretary of State Dulles for "blinding and deceiving Congress and the American people" on the Taiwan crisis. Morse said that the era of 19th-century lone-wolf diplomats and manipulators of world destiny is gone forever.
    Morse said that the U.S. Far East policy "is decided by a Secretary of State like Dulles, by a self-proclaimed representative like Dulles, by a Taiwan Strait Commander like Lieutenant General Smoot." He predicted that the American people would be forced to pay an unprecedentedly high price for Dulles's policies.

    Senator Kennedy Believes
    U.S. Provocation of War Would Have Unimaginable Consequences
    Another Democratic Senator, Kennedy, also delivered a speech on the evening of the 14th, vehemently criticizing the Eisenhower administration's policy of playing with fire in the Far East.
    He warned that the U.S. entering into a war with China in the Taiwan Strait area "without allies or the support of world opinion" would have "unimaginable consequences."
    In his speech, Kennedy also revealed the truth about the U.S. "paper tiger" being strong on the outside but weak on the inside. He said that the situation in the Taiwan area provided a "startling lesson," which is that the U.S. "has not considered whether its military strength is sufficient to fulfill these obligations when undertaking obligations around the world."

    "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" Calls
    Americans to Rise Up Against the Government's Policy of Playing with Fire
    The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch," published in St. Louis, criticized Eisenhower's radio address on September 11 as a belligerent and anti-people China speech. The newspaper called on Americans to oppose the authorities' military provocations against China.
　　In another editorial, the newspaper also sharply condemned Dulles for engaging in "mad gambling" in the Far East. It demanded a change in America's aggressive foreign policy and called for Dulles's resignation.
　　"Capital Times" Argues
　　Deprive the President of the Power to "Act Freely"
　　The "Capital Times," published in Madison (Wisconsin), also criticized Eisenhower and Dulles's provocative policies. The newspaper advocated convening Congress to deprive the President of the power to "act freely" on the Taiwan issue before Eisenhower and Dulles push the United States into war.

    "New York Times" Admits
    Ordinary Americans Oppose Taking Risks in the Far East
　　The "New York Times" published a letter to the editor signed by Robert King, which stated that American "ordinary citizens cannot help but feel terrified that the United States is being drawn into a war with China over two small islands only a few miles from the Chinese mainland." The "New York Times" also admitted that American ordinary citizens "hardly anyone believes that the coastal islands (of China) or the island of Taiwan are indispensable to America's vital interests."

    Many Newspapers Worry
    U.S. Provocative Policies Lack Support from Allies
    "New York Herald Tribune" Washington correspondent Drummond worried that U.S. policy in the Far East would lead to a world war. He believes that if the U.S. intervenes in China's liberation of Quemoy and Matsu, it "will be opposed by all non-aligned countries and will not be supported by any major power allied with it."
    "New York Times" London correspondent Middleton wrote that government officials and public opinion in Western European allies of the U.S. strongly oppose U.S. military action to prevent China from liberating Quemoy and Matsu, so as not to lead to war with China as a result.
    Middleton sadly admitted that Western European countries do not consider China to be their enemy; in fact, they have been attracted by the prospect of trade with China.
    "New York Times" correspondents in Paris, Bonn, Rome, and other Western European capitals also presented similar views in their reports. These reports pointed out that in Western European countries, there is a growing demand for the U.S. to pursue a "more sensible" policy in the Far East. This means that the U.S. should recognize China's rights in the United Nations and ultimately abandon the illusion that Chiang Kai-shek could still return to the Chinese mainland.

### 害怕被杜勒斯拖进火坑  美国国内惊慌不安

    害怕被杜勒斯拖进火坑
    美国国内惊慌不安
    据新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：美国统治集团在台湾地区的军事挑衅政策受到美国国内外各界人士和舆论越来越强烈的反对。
    参议员莫尔斯说
    杜勒斯是在欺骗美国人民
    民主党参议员莫尔斯在“民族”周刊上发表文章，抨击国务卿杜勒斯在台湾危机问题上“蒙蔽和欺骗国会和美国人民”。莫尔斯说，十九世纪单枪匹马地横冲直撞的外交家和世界命运支配者的时代，已经一去不复返了。
    莫尔斯说，美国的远东政策“是由杜勒斯这样一个国务卿来决定，由杜勒斯这样一个冒名代表来决定，由斯摩特中将这样一个台湾海峡司令来决定的”。他预言，美国人民将被迫为杜勒斯政策付出空前高昂的代价。
    参议员肯尼迪认为
    美国挑起战争后果不堪设想
    另一个民主党参议员肯尼迪也在14日晚上发表谈话，猛烈抨击艾森豪威尔政府在远东的玩火政策。
    他警告说，美国在“没有盟国、没有世界舆论支持”的情况下在台湾海峡地区陷入同中国的战争，“其后果将不堪设想”。
    肯尼迪在讲话中还道破了美国“纸老虎”外强中干的真相。他说，台湾地区的局势提供了一次“惊人的教训”，这个教训就是：美国“在世界各地承担义务的时候并不曾考虑过自己的军事力量是不是足以履行这些义务”。
    “圣路易邮报”呼吁
    美国人起来反对政府玩火政策
    圣路易市出版的“圣路易邮报”的社论指责艾森豪威尔9月11日的广播演说是一篇好战和敌视人民中国的演说。这家报纸呼吁美国人反对当局对中国的军事挑衅。
　　这家报纸在另一篇社论中还尖锐地谴责杜勒斯在远东进行“疯狂的赌博”。它要求改变美国的侵略性外交政策。并且要求杜勒斯辞职。
　　“首府时代报”主张
　　剥夺总统“自由采取行动”权力
　　在麦迪逊（威斯康星州）出版的“首府时代报”也对艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的挑衅政策进行了抨击。这家报纸主张召开国会，趁艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯还没有把美国推入战争之前剥夺总统在台湾问题上“自由采取行动”的权力。
    “纽约时报”承认
    美国普通人反对在远东冒险 　“纽约时报”登载了由罗伯特·金署名的一封读者来信，这封信说，美国“普通公民对美国因为距中国大陆只有几英里的两个小岛而卷入同中国的战争，不得不感到惊恐”。“纽约时报”还承认，美国的普通公民“几乎没有一个人认为：（中国）沿海岛屿或者台湾岛是美国切身利益必不可少的”。
    不少报纸担忧
    美国挑衅政策得不到盟国支持
    “纽约先驱论坛报”驻华盛顿记者德拉蒙德担忧美国在远东的政策会导致世界大战。他认为，如果美国干涉中国解放金门和马祖，它“将受到所有不参加集团的各国人士的反对，而且也不会得到同它结盟的任何大国的支持”。
    “纽约时报”驻伦敦记者密德尔顿写道，美国西欧盟国的政府人士和社会舆论坚决反对美国采取军事行动来阻止中国解放金门、马祖，以免因此导致同中国的战争。
    密德尔顿悲哀地承认，西欧国家并不认为中国是自己的敌人；事实上，它们已经被同中国进行贸易的前景吸引住了。
    “纽约时报”驻巴黎、波恩、罗马和其他西欧国家首都的记者在报道中也提出了类似的看法。这些报道指出，在西欧各国，人们日益强烈地要求美国在远东执行“比较明智”的政策。这意味着：美国应该承认中国在联合国的权利，并且最终地抛弃关于蒋介石还有可能回到中国大陆的幻想。
