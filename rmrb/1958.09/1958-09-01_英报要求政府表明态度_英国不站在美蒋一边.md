Xinhua News Agency, London, 30th August (Tass): British newspapers are concerned about the tense situation caused by the provocative actions of the United States and its supported Chiang Kai-shek clique in the Taiwan Strait.

	The "Daily Herald" emphasized that there is no interest in linking Britain with Chiang Kai-shek. The newspaper demanded that the British government publicly state to the US government that, regardless of any excuses, Britain will not stand with Chiang Kai-shek. The newspaper stated, "It is not worth fighting for Chiang Kai-shek. It is meaningless to sacrifice even one Briton or American so that Chiang Kai-shek can extend his puppet claws to the Chinese government as before." The newspaper said that US support for Chiang Kai-shek contains the danger of war. "As long as the United States does not abandon its support for Chiang Kai-shek and as long as China does not enter the United Nations, this threat will continue to exist."
	The Washington correspondent for the "Daily Express" said, "The United States may become isolated from world opinion and its own allies." It continued, "If things develop to the point of conflict, the United States will have to explain its actions at another emergency meeting of the United Nations."

　　英报要求政府表明态度
　　英国不站在美蒋一边
    新华社31日讯  据塔斯社伦敦30日讯：英国报纸对美国和它扶植的蒋介石集团在台湾海峡的挑衅行动所造成的紧张局势感到焦虑。
      “每日先驱报”着重说，没有什么利益可把英国同蒋介石联系起来，报纸要求英国公开向美国政府表示：不管有任何借口，英国不会站到蒋介石一边。报纸说，“不值得为蒋介石打仗。为了使蒋介石能够像以前一样地向中国政府伸出傀儡爪子，即使只牺牲一个英国人或美国人也是毫无意义的。”这家报纸说，美国对蒋介石的支持蕴藏着战争危险。“只要美国不放弃对蒋介石的支持，只要中国不进入联合国，这种威胁就一直会存在下去。”
    “每日快报”驻华盛顿记者说，“美国可能脱离世界舆论和自己的盟国而陷于孤立”。它接着说，“如果事情发展到冲突的地步，美国就得在另一次联合国紧急会议上解释自己的行动”。
