    The National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition opens in the capital today. This unprecedentedly grand exhibition is being held against the backdrop of the surging waves of industrial and agricultural leaps forward across the country. Every object, model, photograph, and chart in the exhibition shines with the wisdom of China's working class and laboring people, and with the brilliance of the general line for socialist construction. From here, people can see the great achievements of China's industrial and transportation construction in the past nine years, especially in the Great Leap Forward this year, and can see the bright future of our country. This exhibition will further strengthen the confidence of the Chinese people in accelerating their march towards socialism and push the current surging tide of construction to new heights.
    The exhibition summarizes the achievements of China's industrial and transportation construction with rich objects, models, photographs, and charts. The production indicators that are soaring upwards like rockets tell us that the superiority of the socialist system is not only incomparable to the semi-feudal and semi-colonial social system, but also beyond the reach of the capitalist system. From 1949 to 1958, China's cumulative steel production was 30.21 million tons, while in the forty-nine years from the beginning of modern metallurgical industry to 1949 in old China, the cumulative production was only 7.6 million tons. The nine years of the new China are almost four times that of the forty-nine years of old China. From 1952 to 1957, China's steel production increased at an average annual rate of 31.7%, while during the same period, the United States only increased by 3.7%, the United Kingdom by 3.9%, and France by 5.3%. From the construction of the first power plant in 1882 to 1949 in the old China, the total installed capacity of power generation equipment was only 1.85 million kilowatts. However, in the nine years since liberation, the total installed capacity of power generation equipment increased by 5.09 million kilowatts. The achievements of the new China in nine years are equivalent to 2.7 times that of the old China in sixty-eight years. From 1949 to 1957, China's power generation increased at an average annual rate of 19%, while the United States only increased by 9.6% and the United Kingdom by 8% during the same period. In the thirty-eight years before liberation, China's total coal production was more than 1 billion tons, with an annual average of 27.1 million tons, while in the nine years after liberation, coal production reached more than 830 million tons, with an annual average of more than 92 million tons, which is more than three times that before liberation. This year, when capitalist countries are generally suffering from the storms of economic crisis and industrial production is generally declining or stagnating, the output of various industries in China is growing at a speed unprecedented in history. This year's scale of capital construction and the planned increase in equipment capacity are even greater than the past five years. Comrade Mao Zedong's prediction: "In the future, there will be all kinds of undertakings that people have never imagined, and high yields of crops that are several times, dozens of times, or even dozens of times higher than the current ones. The development of industry, transportation, and exchange undertakings is even unimaginable by predecessors." (See the annotation on page 675 of "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside") is being realized. Those pessimistic people who believe that our "poor and blank" country cannot rapidly develop its own industry, please go to the exhibition and take a look! Miracles are right in front of you. This is a socialist miracle. These miracles are something that imperialists will never understand. The East Wind they fear is vigorously prevailing over the West Wind. The oriental dragon they are worried about is soaring, and in the near future will leave them far behind.
    The miracles that have appeared in China's industrial and transportation construction are by no means accidental phenomena, but the result of the hard struggle of more than 600 million people under the banner of our Party's correct line, and the result of the superiority of the socialist system. Based on the principle of the worker-peasant alliance and the principle of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and based on the specific situation that China is a large country with more than 500 million peasants out of more than 600 million people, and that agriculture not only supplies the people's most necessary living materials, but also is the main source of raw materials for light industry, and is also the most important market for light industry and heavy industry, our Party creatively proposed the policy of "developing industry and agriculture simultaneously under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry." Based on the objective law that socialist economy must develop in a planned and proportionate manner; based on the characteristics that China has a large population, a vast area, and an unbalanced industrial distribution, and that all provinces, cities, and counties, and even every cooperative, have an urgent need and high enthusiasm for developing industry; based on the characteristics that China is rich in mineral and agricultural resources, and that all provinces, cities, and counties, and even every cooperative, have the possibility of developing industry, our Party creatively proposed the policy of "developing central industry and local industry simultaneously, and developing large-scale enterprises and medium- and small-scale enterprises simultaneously under the conditions of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation." The general line for socialist construction formulated by our Party by combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's practice, like a key, has activated the great wisdom and courage hidden in the local organizations at all levels and the more than 600 million people in our country, and turned them into a world-shaking material force. Now everyone can see that on China's vast land, not only are there tens of millions of workers participating in industrial production and construction, but also more than 500 million peasants who have been organized. More than 500 million peasants not only provide abundant raw materials for light industry with an unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture, and open up the world's largest domestic market for light industry and heavy industry products, but also directly participate in industrial construction and production. They not only participate in the construction and production of agricultural and livestock product processing factories, but also participate in the construction and production of heavy industry. They explore mineral resources shoulder to shoulder with the working class, and build steel plants, power stations, mines, fertilizer plants, cement plants, and farm tool repair shops shoulder to shoulder, forming a nationwide upsurge in running industries. Precisely because of this reason, since this year, China has been able to build thousands of medium- and small-sized steel plants, coal kilns, power stations, non-ferrous metal mines, chemical fertilizer plants, cement plants, and machinery plants while building thousands of large-scale modern backbone industrial enterprises, so that the industrially backward China will soon appear a new situation where machines are sounding everywhere and factories are all over the urban and rural areas. The formation of this new situation will greatly accelerate the process of China's industrialization, accelerate the process of China's agricultural modernization, and accelerate the process of eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas.
    The leap in industrial production and construction is also the result of the victory of the nationwide rectification movement. In the rectification movement, the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, not only crushed the bourgeois rightists' offensive, but also swept away the official airs, lethargy, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness of cadres and the masses, and further eliminated the remaining poison of the old system, old habits, and old ideas in society. In industrial and mining enterprises, because leading cadres eat, live, and labor with the masses, because management personnel participate in part of physical labor, and because workers directly participate in part of management work, the mutual assistance and unity between the upper and lower levels and between the left and right have been strengthened, making the relations of production more suitable for the needs of the development of productive forces. Because in the rectification movement, those rules and regulations that restrict the development of productive forces and restrict the enthusiasm of the masses have been improved, the socialist superstructure is more suitable for the needs of the development of the economic base, and can more powerfully promote the development of productive forces. In the rectification movement, because conservative and backward ideas were criticized, the communist ideology of the staff and workers was greatly improved. All kinds of superstition, fear, and inferiority complex towards bourgeois technical authority were swept away, and the spirit of daring to think, daring to act, and daring to create was universally carried forward. The above factors, combined with the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, have been transformed into great revolutionary enthusiasm and infinite power. People have widely carried out competitions to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced in their work. Quotas are constantly being broken, and new technologies are constantly being created. Therefore, in many enterprises, although the workers are still the workers of last year and the equipment is still the equipment of last year, the output of products has increased several times, and the speed of construction has also been accelerated several times. Miracles that people could not have imagined before have appeared one after another. All this proves a truth: the amount of means of production and the role of material are certainly very important for the speed of production development, but what plays a decisive role in production is people. As long as we can consciously solve the contradiction between the relations of production and the productive forces, solve the contradiction between the superstructure and the base, and solve the contradiction between people's subjective world (ideological understanding) and the objective world, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of people in production, we can make China's industry catch up with and surpass all capitalist countries in a relatively short period of time.
    There is no doubt that the achievements of China's industrial and transportation construction are great. Even our enemies have to admit this. However, there is no limit to the upstream, and the potential of 600 million people is infinite. For us, any great achievement is only a new starting point for continuing to move forward, not an end point. Moreover, this year is only the first year of the Great Leap Forward, only a preliminary test of strength, or a prelude. The "Huaihai Battle," which is decisive for the three years of hard work, is still in the next year. At present, we must especially grasp steel production, which is the key of the key in current industrial production. Although steel production has increased significantly, it is still far from the planned target. We must fight this battle with the spirit of combat and combat actions. Therefore, the great achievements reflected in the exhibition should become the driving force for us to continue to move forward. At present, we should take concrete measures to ensure that we get 10.7 million tons of steel, only more, not less. We must not be arrogant or impetuous, continue to hold high the red flag of the general line, and move forward at a greater speed and with more firm steps!

    更大跃进的起点
    全国工业交通展览会今天在首都开幕了。这个规模空前宏大的展览会，是在全国工农业跃进的浪潮一天高过一天的形势下举办的。展览会的每一件实物、模型、照片和图表，都闪烁着我国工人阶级和劳动人民的智慧，闪烁着社会主义建设总路线的光芒。人们从这里可以看见我国的工业交通建设，在过去九年中特别是今年大跃进中的伟大成就，可以从这里看到我们国家光辉灿烂的未来。这个展览会将进一步坚定我国人民加速向社会主义迈进的信心，把当前澎湃的建设高潮推向新的高峰。
    展览会用丰富的实物、模型、照片和图表总结了我国工业交通建设的成就。像火箭一般向上飞奔的生产指标告诉我们，社会主义制度的优越性，不仅是半封建半殖民地的社会制度不可比拟的，也是资本主义制度望尘莫及的。从1949年到1958年，我国钢的累计产量为三千零二十一万吨，而旧中国从开始建立现代冶金工业起到1949年的四十九年间，累计产量只有七百六十万吨。新中国的九年差不多等于旧中国四十九年的四倍。从1952年到1957年，我国钢产量每年平均增长速度达到31.7％，而同期美国才增长3.7％，英国增长3.9％，法国增长5.3％。我国电力工业从1882年建设第一个电厂起到1949年的六十八年间，全部发电设备容量只有一百八十五万瓩，但在解放以来的九年间，增加的发电设备总容量就有五百零九万瓩。新中国九年的成就等于旧中国六十八年的二点七倍。从1949年到1957年，我国发电量每年平均增长19％，而同期美国只增长9.6％，英国增长8％。在解放前的三十八年间，我国煤的总产量是十亿多吨，每年平均二千七百一十万吨，而在解放以后的九年，共产煤达到八亿三千多万吨，每年平均九千二百多万吨，相当于解放前的三倍还多。今年，当资本主义国家正普遍遭到经济危机的风暴袭击，工业产量普遍下降或停滞的时候，我国各种工业的产量却以历史上从来没有过的速度增长着。今年基本建设规模和计划增加的设备能力，更是一年胜过过去的五年。毛泽东同志的预言：“将来会出现从来没有被人们设想过的种种事业，几倍、十几倍以至几十倍于现在的农作物的高产量。工业、交通和交换事业的发展，更是前人所不能设想的。”（见“中国农村的社会主义高潮”六百七十五页的按语）正在实现着。那些认为“又穷又白”的我国不能迅速发展自己的工业的悲观论者，请你们到展览会去看一看吧！奇迹就在你们的面前。这是社会主义的奇迹。这些奇迹是帝国主义者永远所不能理解的。他们所惧怕的东风正在猛烈地压倒西风。他们所担心的东方巨龙正在飞腾，不久的将来就会把他们远远地抛在后面。
    我国工业交通建设中出现的奇迹，绝不是什么偶然的现象，而是六亿多人民在我们党的正确路线的旗帜下，进行艰苦奋斗的结果，是社会主义制度优越性的结果。我们的党根据工农联盟的原理和优先发展重工业的原理，根据我国是一个大国，在六亿多人口中农民占五亿多，农业不仅供应人民最必需的生活资料，而且是轻工业原料的主要来源，又是轻工业和重工业的最主要的市场这些具体情况，创造性地提出了“在重工业优先发展的条件下，工业和农业同时并举”的方针。我们的党根据社会主义经济必须有计划按比例发展的客观规律；根据我国人口众多、地区广阔、工业分布又不平衡，各省各市各县直到每个合作社都有发展工业的迫切需要和高度积极性的特点；根据我国矿产资源和农产资源丰富，各省各市各县直到每个合作社都具备发展工业的可能性的特点，创造性地提出了“在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举”的方针。我们的党把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和我国实践相结合起来制定的社会主义建设总路线，像一把钥匙一样，把我国各级地方组织和六亿多人民中蕴藏着的大智大勇开动起来，变成了翻天复地的物质力量。现在谁都可以看到，在我国辽阔的土地上，参加工业生产和建设的，不仅有几千万的工人队伍，还有组织起来了的五亿多农民。五亿多农民不仅以农业上空前大丰收给轻工业提供丰富的原料，为轻工业和重工业产品开辟世界上最大的国内市场，而且直接参加了工业的建设和生产。他们不仅参加农畜产品加工工厂的建设和生产，而且参加了重工业的建设和生产。他们和工人阶级肩并肩地勘探矿产资源，肩并肩地建设钢铁厂，建设电站、矿山、化肥厂、水泥厂和农具修理厂，形成了全民办工业的热潮。正因为这个缘故，今年以来，我国才能在兴建上千项大型的现代骨干工业企业的同时，兴建成千上万的中小型钢铁厂、煤窑、电站、有色金属矿山、化学肥料厂、水泥厂、机械厂和农畜产品加工厂，使工业落后的中国，很快出现一个机器到处响、工厂遍城乡的新局面。这个新局面的形成，将大大加速我国工业化的进程，加速我国农业现代化的进程，加速消除城乡差别的进程。
    工业生产和建设的飞跃，也是全民整风运动胜利的结果。在整风运动中，全国人民在党的领导下，不仅粉碎了资产阶级右派进攻，并且横扫了干部和群众中的官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气，进一步肃清了旧制度、旧习惯、旧思想在社会上的遗毒。在工矿企业中，由于领导干部跟群众同吃同住同劳动，由于管理人员参加了一部分体力劳动，以及工人群众直接参加了一部分管理工作，密切了上下之间、左右之间的互助团结，使生产关系更适合于生产力发展的需要。由于在整风运动中，改进了那些限制生产力发展、限制群众积极性的规章制度，社会主义的上层建筑更适合于经济基础发展的需要，更能有力地促进生产力的发展。在整风运动中，由于批判了保守和落后思想，职工群众的共产主义思想大大提高。对资产阶级技术权威的种种迷信、恐惧和自卑感，被一扫而空，敢想、敢干、敢独创的精神得到了普遍发扬。上述这些因素和鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线结合起来，便化为伟大的革命干劲，无穷无尽的力量。人们在劳动中，广泛开展了比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛。定额不断地被突破，新的技术不断地被创造。因此，在许多企业里，虽然工人还是去年的工人，设备还是去年的设备，但是产品产量却成倍地增长，建设的速度也成倍地加快，以前人们所想像不到的奇迹一个接着一个出现。这一切都证明了一个真理：生产资料的多少，物质的作用，对于生产发展的快慢固然是很重要的，但是在生产中起决定作用的却是人。只要我们能自觉地解决生产关系与生产力之间的矛盾，解决上层建筑与基础之间的矛盾，解决人们的主观世界（思想认识）与客观世界之间的矛盾，充分发挥人在生产中的积极性和创造性，便可以在比较短的时间内，使我国工业赶上和超过所有的资本主义国家。
    毫无疑问，我国工业交通建设的成绩是伟大的。这一点连我们的敌人也不得不承认了。但是，上游无止境，六亿人民的潜力无穷无尽。对于我们来说，任何伟大的成就都只是继续前进的新的起点，而不是终点。而且今年还仅仅是大跃进的第一年，仅仅是初试锋芒，或者说是一个序曲。对三年苦战具有决定意义的“淮海大战”还在明年。而在目前更要特别抓紧钢铁生产，这是当前工业生产中关键的关键。目前钢铁生产虽有较大增长，但距预定目标还相差很远。必须用战斗的精神、战斗的行动，打好这一仗。因此，展览会反映的伟大成绩应该成为鼓舞我们继续前进的动力，目前应当切实地采取具体措施，保证拿到一千零七十万吨钢，只准多，不准少。我们必须不骄不躁，继续高举总路线的红旗，以更大的速度和更坚定的步伐前进！
