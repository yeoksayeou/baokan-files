Xinhua News Agency, Harbin: Heilongjiang Province is undergoing nationwide arming.

The heads of the newly organized people's commune militias in the suburbs of Harbin are demanding a swift nationwide arming, with one hand on a gun and the other on a hoe, to confront the military provocations of U.S. imperialism. Liu Guolin and Sun Wanqiang, deputy battalion commanders of the Xinfa People's Commune militia, Wu Ronghe, deputy company commander, and Jiang Changfa, platoon leader, arrived at the military service bureau early in the morning, requesting the issuance of weapons. When this people's commune militia organization rallied and paraded on the 7th, the militiamen proposed to "leap forward in production, and quickly train troops."

The Longjiang Electric Factory in Harbin City established a 2,500-member factory defense team, and held a gun distribution ceremony on the 9th. These new defense team members stated: We will hold a gun in one hand and a tool in the other, and give U.S. imperialism a severe blow. Zou Jiqing, deputy captain of the Second Brigade, said excitedly, our backs are straight, and our entire team is ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. Female team members Tan Guijie and Li Fengling said that we women are experts in production, and we will also join the male team members in striking at U.S. imperialists.

The vast rural areas of Heilongjiang Province are undergoing intense militia training. With the development of the people's commune movement and the peasants' anger at U.S. imperialism's war provocations, the militia ranks have expanded to millions of people, forming a situation of universal conscription regardless of gender throughout the province. Taiping People's Commune in Shuangcheng County originally had only 2,000 militiamen, but after the establishment of the people's commune, it immediately developed to more than 4,000 militiamen. The 20,000 militiamen who are building a reservoir on the Nihe River in Hulan County said after hearing Premier Zhou's statement that they are ready to listen to the call of the motherland at any time and defend the integrity of the motherland's territory.

    据新华社哈尔滨讯　黑龙江省正在全民武装。
    哈尔滨市郊区新近组织起来的人民公社民兵的负责人，要求迅速地全民武装起来，一手拿枪，一手拿锄头，来对付美帝国主义的军事挑衅。新发人民公社民兵副营长刘国林、孙万强，副连长吴荣和，排长姜长发，一清早就赶着大车来到了兵役局，要求发给他们枪支。这个人民公社的民兵组织在7日集会游行时民兵们提出要做到“生产大跃进，练兵要迅速”。
    哈尔滨市的龙江电工厂成立了两千五百人的工厂保卫队，9日举行了发枪仪式，这些新的保卫队员们表示：我们要一手拿枪，一手拿工具，给美帝国主义狠狠的打击。第二大队副队长邹吉庆非常激动地说，我们腰干是硬的，我们全队随时准备响应祖国的号召。女队员谭桂洁、李凤玲说，我们妇女生产上是能手，而且也要和男队员一道打击美帝国主义者。
    黑龙江省广大的农村正紧张的进行民兵训练，随着人民公社运动的发展和农民对美帝国主义的战争挑衅的愤怒，民兵队伍已扩展到数百万人，并在全省形成了不分男女，全民皆兵的形势。双城县太平人民公社原来只有二千名民兵，建立人民公社后马上就发展到四千多名民兵。呼兰县正在泥河上修水库的两万名民兵听了周总理的声明后，他们表示，随时听候祖国的召唤，保卫祖国领土的完整。
