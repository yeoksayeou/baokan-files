American Aggressors—The Deadly Enemy of the Chinese People

On September 11, U.S. President Eisenhower, in a radio address, slandered China as a “warlike, aggressive” and “major aggressor.” However, this slanderous curse cannot drown out the truth, and it cannot deceive or intimidate the great Chinese people. The Chinese people clearly know that U.S. imperialism is an experienced aggressor, a major aggressor stained with the blood of the Chinese people, and the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. More than a century ago, the United States used warships and troops to invade China. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it actively supported the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in launching a civil war. After the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, it still tried every means to invade our country, sending special agents to carry out subversion, blatantly interfering in our country's internal affairs, occupying our territory, and frequently carrying out military provocations and war threats against our country.

Who exactly is the "major aggressor"? Now let the criminal facts committed by U.S. imperialism in China testify! (New China News Agency dispatch)

As early as one hundred and fourteen years ago, U.S. imperialism used its fleet to invade China's territorial waters, coercing the Qing government into signing the unequal Treaty of Wanghia, beginning to kill, plunder, seize land, and extort money in China. The lower left of the picture shows the foreign gun team organized by U.S. imperialists to suppress the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising army. The upper picture shows U.S. troops participating in the Eight-Nation Alliance's capture of Beijing. The lower right shows U.S. warships running rampant in the Yangtze River estuary. In 1925, the United States colluded with British and Japanese imperialists to create the May 30th Massacre, and in 1927, it shelled Nanjing and Jiangyin, frantically suppressing our country's democratic revolutionary movement.

The so-called "cultural" and "charitable" undertakings run by U.S. imperialism became places for slaughtering the Chinese people. The "Orphanage" of the Wuchang Diocese of the former Hankou Catholic Church, presided over by an American bishop, massacred more than 57,000 Chinese infants in the twenty-three years before liberation (right). Dr. Lehman, a former American physician at Peking Union Medical College, also used healthy Chinese people for animal experiments with convulsants (lower left). The upper left is a photo of the collective rape case by U.S. troops in the Jingming Building in Hankou.

From the September 18th Incident to the outbreak of the Pacific War, for a full ten years, U.S. imperialism was the largest supplier of military materials to the Japanese invaders in our country. U.S. ports continuously shipped large quantities of steel (top right picture) to Japan, which were used to slaughter millions of Chinese people. Then, U.S. imperialism armed the Kuomintang army with six billion U.S. dollars worth of military supplies to launch a civil war (bottom right picture). U.S. troops stationed in China also arbitrarily killed our civilians. The left picture shows the scene after a U.S. military truck in Qingdao ran over and killed five-year-old Liu Xiaoqing and drove away.

U.S. imperialism used espionage tactics to massacre the Chinese people and carry out subversive activities. In the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization," a joint U.S.-Chiang special agent organization, even two-and-a-half-year-old Wang Xiaohua and nine-month-old Wang Youhua were tragically murdered along with their parents (bottom right). The lower left shows the American shackles of the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization." (Top picture) The dropped American spies Downey, Fecteau, Arnold, Baumer, etc. are on trial in our country. The center left shows the American spy Li An-tung, who plotted to shell Tiananmen Square.

    美国侵略者——中国人民的死敌
    9月11日，美国总统艾森豪威尔在广播演说中诬蔑中国为“好战的侵略成性的”“大侵略者”。可是，这种血口喷人的咒骂毕竟淹没不了真理，这种咒骂既骗不了也吓不倒伟大的中国人民。中国人民清楚地知道：美帝国主义者正是一个侵略的老手，是沾满中国人民鲜血的大侵略者，是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。还在一百多年以前，美国就用兵舰、军队侵略中国，抗日战争胜利后，又积极扶持蒋介石卖国集团发动内战，中国人民革命胜利后，仍千方百计侵略我国，派遣特务进行颠复活动，露骨地干涉我国内政，霸占我国领土，经常对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。
    究竟谁是“大侵略者”？现在就让美帝国主义者在中国干下的罪恶事实来作证吧！　（新华社稿）

    远在一百一十四年前，美帝国主义就用舰队侵入中国领海，威逼清政府签订不平等的望厦条约，开始在中国杀人越货，霸地诈财。图中左下是美帝国主义者组织的镇压太平天国起义军的洋枪队，上是美国军队参加八国联军攻占我北京，右下是美国军舰横行长江口。美国在1925年勾结英、日帝国主义制造五卅惨案，在1927年炮轰南京、江阴，疯狂镇压我国民主革命运动。
    美帝国主义办的什么“文化”、“慈善”事业，成了屠杀中国人民的场所。美籍主教主持的前汉口天主教武昌教区“育婴堂”在解放前的二十三年中，残杀了五万七千多个中国婴孩（右）。北京协和医院前美籍医师雷曼还用健康的中国人来做抽疯剂的动物试验（左下）。左上是汉口景明大楼美军集体强奸案照片。
    从“九一八”事变到太平洋战争爆发，整整十年中，美帝国主义一直是日寇侵略我国的军火物资的最大供应者，美国港口不断地为日本启运大批钢材（右上图），用来屠杀千百万中国人。接着，美帝国主义并以六十亿美元的军火物资武装国民党军队发动内战（右下图）。驻华美军还任意杀害我老百姓。左图是青岛美军卡车辗死五岁儿童刘小青、扬长而去后的现场情景。
    美帝国主义用特务政策屠杀中国人民并进行颠覆活动，在“中美合作所”这个美蒋联合特务机构里，连两岁半的王小华和九个月的王幼华都和父母亲一起惨遭毒手（右下）。左下是“中美合作所”的美国镣铐。（上图）空投的美国间谍唐奈、费克图、阿诺德、包莫等在我国受审。左中是阴谋炮轰天安门的美国间谍李安东。
