Letter Commentary:

    Money is not omnipotent
    The health leadership organizations of Jinci Town, Taiyuan City, and the 119 Geological Exploration Team of the North China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau used fines and high prices to buy flies in order to stimulate the masses' enthusiasm for eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene. In essence, this is a practice that lacks a mass viewpoint and is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology! Eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene are in the vital interests of the masses. Since the Great Leap Forward, the masses' thinking has improved rapidly, and they support all of the Party's policies. As long as we trust the masses, conduct thorough persuasion and education beforehand, and clear the masses' minds, they will consciously and voluntarily do it, and things will be done even better than we imagined. Treating the masses with "fines" and "buying" will only arouse the masses' resentment or develop capitalist tendencies. Money is not omnipotent, political and ideological work is omnipotent. Only by putting politics in command and planting the red flag in our minds can we mobilize the masses and complete the work tasks.

    金钱不是万能的
    太原市晋祠镇的卫生领导机关和华北煤田地质勘探局119地质勘探队用罚款和高价收买苍蝇的办法刺激群众除四害、讲卫生的积极性，实质上这是一种缺乏群众观点的作法，也是资产阶级思想在作祟！除四害、讲卫生是群众切身的利益；大跃进以来，群众思想飞快提高，对党的各项政策都是拥护的。只要我们相信群众，事先进行充分的说服教育，群众的思想搞通了，就会自觉自愿地干起来，事情就会做得比我们所想像的还要好。用“罚款”和“收买”的方法对待群众，只会引起群众的反感或发展资本主义倾向。金钱不是万能的，政治思想工作才是万能的。只有政治挂帅，思想上插了红旗，才能把群众发动起来，完成工作任务。
