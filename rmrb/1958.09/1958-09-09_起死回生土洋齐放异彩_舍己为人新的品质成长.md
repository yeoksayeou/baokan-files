　　Bringing the Dead Back to Life: Indigenous and Foreign Methods Shine; Selfless Dedication: New Qualities Grow

　　Chinese Medicine Launches a Satellite
    In the ginseng-producing areas of Jilin, there's a saying: "Seven taels of ginseng, eight taels of treasure," indicating that in ginseng history, ginseng exceeding seven taels in weight is rare. However, at the exhibition, a ginseng king weighing 22.4 taels, shaped like a hunched, long-bearded old man, attracts the interest of every visitor. This is a ginseng that 73-year-old ginseng farmer Wang Yanshun of Donggang Township, Fusong County, Jilin Province, cultivated himself for 42 years. This ginseng king has a poignant history: ginseng farmer Wang Yanshun was an impoverished working person. From the age of 25, he made a living by growing ginseng. In the old society, he suffered the exploitation of the reactionary ruling class. The ginseng he grew was often plundered or forcibly bought at low prices at a very young age. To escape the destruction of the reactionaries, 37 years ago, he secretly transplanted a ginseng that had been cultivated on his land for five years into the forest, determined not to take it out. After liberation, he saw that the Party and the People's Government, based on the needs of the people's health, not only encouraged the masses to cultivate ginseng but also took the interests of ginseng farmers into consideration as much as possible in terms of price. This greatly boosted the enthusiasm of ginseng farmers. So he cultivated this ginseng more diligently and dedicated it to the Party and the people last year when he dug it out.

    At the exhibition, competing with this ginseng king is a Poria cocos king weighing 72 catties. Poria cocos is one of the main medicinal ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine, which can strengthen the stomach and soothe the nerves, and is of high value. In the past, the general cultivation period was five years, and the heaviest at harvest was only two or three catties. Last year, Yang Zhengqing, Yang Handong and others, members of the Huangxing Agricultural Cooperative in Gedu Township, Qianshan County, Anhui Province, encouraged by the Party and the government, used their brains and found tricks to cultivate Poria cocos. After a year and a half, they harvested two large Poria cocos. The other smaller one also weighed 53 catties.
　　Indigenous Methods Cure Major Diseases
    Among the exhibits from Sichuan Province, there is a photo: a young man who looks like he has just recovered from a long illness, his face thin but slightly smiling. It turns out that this young man unfortunately contracted gallstone disease. Gallstone disease is a difficult disease to treat. The general treatment method at present is to remove the stones by surgery. But this cannot guarantee a complete cure. This young patient had suffered the pain of four operations in five years, and gallstones still appeared. This year, inspired by the General Line, doctors at the No. 2 People's Hospital of Chongqing, in cooperation with Chongqing Medical College, boldly used herbal medicine, mainly Desmodium styracifolium and Stellaria dichotoma, to treat him. After two months of treatment, the stones basically disappeared, finally enabling this young man to regain his health.

    People are very surprised that recently, when treating sores and wound infections, the Tianjin Saltworks Hospital no longer injects patients with expensive penicillin but instead puts some herbal medicine on the wound. This herbal medicine is not only much cheaper than penicillin, but also has a shorter course of treatment and is 100% effective. For example, for wound infections, Western medicine takes about ten days to heal, while this herbal medicine heals in five or six days. What kind of magic medicine is this? It turns out to be just some wild plants that can be picked up everywhere in the fields—Cirsium setosum. Doctors at the Tianjin Saltworks Hospital broke with the superstition of Western medicine and boldly adopted indigenous folk methods, using Cirsium setosum to treat sores, ulcers and other diseases, reducing the pain and economic burden of patients.

    Indigenous methods and herbal medicine can cure major diseases, which is one of the deep impressions given to visitors by this exhibition. The exhibition tells people that in the vast fields and forests of the motherland, there are endless wild grasses and idle flowers waiting for people who have broken with superstition and liberated their minds to study and use. They may be treasures for saving lives and healing the wounded.
　　Electrocardiogram Oscilloscope for Direct Observation of the Heart
    In front of the exhibits from the Shaanxi region, an electrocardiogram oscilloscope shaped like a radio attracts the audience to linger. A female comrade is sitting upright in front of this precise instrument, with rubber bands with electric wires wrapped around her arms. People see the regular beating of her heart being traced by a dot of light on the fluorescent screen of the instrument, just like watching television. As soon as the female comrade moves slightly, the light trace on the fluorescent screen becomes irregular. It turns out that this female narrator is giving a demonstration. The condition of the heartbeat is essential material for doctors to treat patients with heart disease. In the past, the indirect electrocardiographs used by major hospitals to examine the heart were all imported from abroad, and they could not directly observe the heartbeat like this instrument. Who is the clever creator of this first electrocardiogram oscilloscope in China? He is Wang Yong, a young teaching assistant in the Physics Teaching and Research Group who graduated from Xi'an Medical College in 1953. When Wang Yong introduced the process of trial-producing this instrument to the audience in front of the electrocardiogram oscilloscope, he said that his success in trial-producing the electrocardiogram oscilloscope was first of all due to the encouragement and support of the Party. Last year, he drafted a scientific plan for trial-producing this instrument, which was immediately valued by the Party committee. The college Party committee gave him various support as much as possible despite financial difficulties.
　　Everything for the Patient
    In February of this year, a patient with carbon monoxide poisoning was sent to the Henan Provincial People's Hospital. He had been in a coma for 25 days before he was sent to the hospital. This is unimaginable. According to literature, there is no hope of revival if the comatose state lasts for 48 hours or 72 hours. However, under the guidance of the idea of everything for the patient, the doctors of the Henan Provincial People's Hospital immediately decided to admit the patient, and all the staff of the hospital were mobilized to find ways to save the patient's life. They detoxified the patient from a medical point of view and supplemented the patient's body with various nutrients as much as possible. After arduous efforts, they finally made him wake up after 31 days of coma. The medical staff continued to provide careful treatment and care, and the patient finally fully recovered.

    The ideological quality of "everything for the people's health" is rapidly growing among the vast number of medical staff today. Shanghai exhibited many examples of medical staff creating many miracles of bringing the dead back to life after rescuing Qiu Cai Kang. For example, the medical staff of Tongji Hospital of the Second Military Medical University in Shanghai gave full play to the spirit of communism, cooperated inside and outside the hospital, and saved two patients with severe tetanus who were on the verge of death. Lian Shihai, a doctor at the First Hospital of Shandong Province, painstakingly studied and created a new method of diagnosing and treating biliary ascariasis without surgery in order to reduce the pain of patients. In the research process, in order to understand whether the patient had any pain during the treatment, he personally conducted experiments and swallowed duodenal foreign body forceps. The entire exhibition is a concentrated reflection of the technical revolution and equipment innovation carried out by medical staff across the country under the leadership of the Party, starting from everything for the people's health.

### 起死回生土洋齐放异彩  舍己为人新的品质成长

　　起死回生土洋齐放异彩　舍己为人新的品质成长
　　中药放卫星
    吉林人参产区有这么一句话：“七两参，八两宝”，说明在人参史上，超过七两重的人参是稀有的。但是，展览会上，陈列着一棵重二十二点四两、形同伛偻、长须老者的参海之王，吸引着每一个参观者的兴趣。这是吉林省抚松县东岗乡七十三岁参农王延顺亲手培植了四十二年的一棵人参。原来这个参海之王还有一段辛酸的历史：参农王延顺是一个贫困的劳动人民。从二十五岁开始，以种参为业。在旧社会中，他受尽反动统治阶级的剥削。他种的人参，常常在很小的年龄就被掠夺或贱价强收去。为了逃避反动派的摧残，三十七年前，他把一棵在自己参地上栽培了五年的人参，悄悄地移植到森林中，并下决心不把它拿出来。解放后，他看到党和人民政府根据人民健康的需要，不仅鼓励群众培植人参，而且在价格上尽量照顾参农的利益。大大鼓舞了参农的积极性。于是他更尽心地培植这棵参，并在去年把它挖出来，献给了党和人民。
    在展览会上，与这棵参海之王媲美的，还有一个七十二斤重的茯苓大王。茯苓是中药材中主要药味之一，可以健胃、安神，价值很高。过去一般栽培期要五年，收获时最重也不过两、三斤。去年，安徽省潜山县割肚乡黄兴农业社社员杨正清、杨汉东等，在党和政府的鼓励下，动脑筋，找窍门，培植茯苓，经过一年半的时间，收获了两个大茯苓。另一个小的也有五十三斤重。
　　土法治大病
    在四川省的展出品中，有这么一张照片：一个看来久病刚愈的青年，面庞虽瘦削，却微带着笑容。原来这个青年不幸得了胆管结石病。胆管结石这是一个难治的病症，目前一般的治疗方法是用外科手术取出结石。但这不能保证断根。这个青年患者就曾经在五年中，先后经受了四次手术的痛苦，胆管仍然出现结石。今年，重庆市第二中医院医师，在总路线鼓舞下，取得重庆医学院的配合，大胆采用以金钱草、满天星两种野生植物为主的草药，治疗两个月后，结石即基本消失，终于使这位青年恢复了健康。
    人们很奇怪，近来，天津盐场医院在医治疮疡、外伤感染等疾患时，不再给患者注射贵重的青霉素剂了，而是弄一些草药敷在伤口上。这种草药比青霉素不仅价钱便宜很多，并且疗程短，有百分之百的疗效。如外伤感染，西药医治要十天左右才可能封口，敷这种草药五、六天就好了。这是什么妙药呢！原来只不过是些野地随处都能采撷到的野生植物——刺菜。天津盐场医院医师破除对西药的迷信，大胆采用民间土办法，用刺菜治疗疮疡、溃烂等疾患，减轻了病人的痛苦和经济负担。
    土法、草药能治大病，是这个展览会给予参观者的深刻印象之一。展览会告诉人们：在祖国辽阔的原野、山林中，有无穷无尽的野草、闲花，正等待着破除迷信、思想解放了的人们去研究、利用。它们可能是救死扶伤的宝。
　　直接观察心脏的心电示波器
    在陕西地区的展品前面，一架形似收音机的心电示波器吸引着观众留连不去。有一位女同志正端坐在这架精密的仪器前，两手臂上缠着插有电线的橡皮带。人们像看电视一样，看到一个光点在仪器的萤光屏上有规律地划出她心脏跳动的情况。女同志稍微动一动，萤光屏上出现的光迹就不规律了。原来这位女讲解员正在作示范表演。心脏跳动的情况，是医生医治心脏病患者所不可缺少的材料。过去，各大医院用来检查心脏的间接式心电图描记器，都是国外进口，而且不能像这架仪器一样，能够直接地观察到心脏跳动的情形。这架我国第一架心电示波器的聪明的创造者是谁呢？他是1953年才从西安医学院毕业的物理教研组的一位名叫王永的青年助教。王永在心电示波器前，向观众介绍试制这架仪器的经过时说：他能试制心电示波器成功，首先归功于党的鼓励和支持。去年，他拟定出试制这一仪器的科学计划，立即受到党委的重视。学院党委在经费困难的情况下，仍尽可能给予他各种支持。
　　一切为了病人
    今年2月，河南省人民医院里，送来了一个一氧化碳中毒患者，他被送来医院前，已昏迷二十五天了。这是不可想像的。根据文献，昏迷状态延续到四十八小时或七十二小时，就没有复活的希望。但河南省人民医院的医师在一切为病人的思想指导下，立即决定收下这个患者，并且全院人员都动员起来，想尽办法要挽救这个患者的生命。他们一面从医疗方面为患者排毒，一面尽可能把各种营养补充到患者体内。经过艰苦的努力，终于使他在昏迷三十一日后苏醒过来。医护人员又继续给予精心的治疗、护理，这个患者终于完全恢复健康。
    “一切为了人民健康”的思想品质今天正在广大医务人员中迅速成长。上海市展出了不少医务人员继抢救丘财康之后，又创造了许多起死回生的奇迹的事例。如上海市第二军医大学同济医院医护人员发挥高度共产主义精神，院内外大协作，挽救了两个频于死亡的严重破伤风的病人，山东省立第一医院医师连世海为了减轻病人痛苦，苦心钻研创造出胆道回虫病症不动手术，即能诊断、治疗的新方法。在研究过程中，他为了体会患者在治疗中有无痛苦，曾亲自作试验，吞食十二指肠异物钳子。整个展览会也就是全国医务人员在党的领导下，一切为人民健康出发而进行技术革命、器械革新的集中反映。　本报记者  潘荻
