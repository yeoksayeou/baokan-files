Title: The United States Should Rein In At The Brink Of The Precipice

The nationwide mass demonstrations, Chairman Mao Zedong's warning to the American aggressors at the Supreme State Conference, and the punishment by our Fujian front artillery of the Kinmen Chiang troops and their transport ships, which were recklessly provoking under the protection of the American aggressors: these are our solemn replies to the American aggressors in the past two days.

The US government is now engaged in the most dangerous military adventure since the end of World War II. It is the most dangerous adventure because the object the United States has chosen is a major country with a quarter of the world's population, a country that has competed with the United States before, and which has become many times stronger in political, economic, and military terms since then. At the same time, one cannot fail to notice that this country is allied with the powerful Soviet Union, which has stated that an attack on China is an attack on the Soviet Union. The United States had previously invaded China's neighbor, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, thus triggering the victorious War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea by the Chinese People's Volunteers. The United States had long ago invaded China's territory of Taiwan, and Taiwan is bound to be liberated by China sooner or later. But the current situation is different from those two. Kinmen and Matsu are neither China's neighbors, nor are they separated from the Chinese mainland by the high seas. The United States' declaration to help the Chiang Kai-shek group protect Kinmen and Matsu, or to protect the transport lines from Taiwan to Kinmen and Matsu, puts the United States in an extremely dangerous situation where it could directly engage in armed conflict with China at any time.

The American decision-makers may think that the Chinese government's September 4 statement on territorial waters and September 6 statement on the inadmissibility of American interference in China's internal affairs are just empty threats, and therefore continue to pursue a "brink of war" policy and continue to provoke China. But Americans who think this way are completely wrong. The great People's Republic of China is by no means the kind of country that trembles in the face of the enemy's war threats, and is by no means the kind of country that only talks and does nothing. The unprecedentedly high-spirited mass demonstrations of the whole nation show this. The entire Chinese people express their determination to immediately take up arms and go to the front lines as long as the motherland calls. The whole world knows, and Americans especially know, that the Chinese people are a people who are not afraid of death in order to fight for freedom, and that the Chinese people can never be conquered.

Chairman Mao Zedong's speech at the Supreme State Conference on September 8 accurately explained the determination and confidence of the Chinese people. Chairman Mao pointed out: The American aggressors' occupation of our territory of Taiwan, like the occupation of Lebanon and the establishment of hundreds of military bases in many countries, is only putting a noose around their own necks. The United States' creation of tension in the Taiwan Strait, like the creation of tension in Lebanon and elsewhere, has played the role of mobilizing the people of the world to rise up against the American aggressors. Is this not the truth? Doesn't every recent display of the American policy of aggression seem increasingly absurd and insane, pushing American imperialism more and more towards a completely isolated dead end both internationally and domestically? Would such facts make our great people, who have grown up in the great revolutionary struggle, afraid in the slightest? The American aggressors' tricks can only conquer the opportunists who are ready at any moment to bow down to American atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, American wheat, and American gold yuan, but in the eyes of our fearless people who are creating a new history, all the magic weapons in the hands of the American aggressors are nothing but some garbage on the road of human progress that has not yet been cleared away and is still emitting a stench. If the American decision-makers are determined to tighten the noose that they themselves have put around their necks, then let them do so!

The Chinese people love peace, and the Chinese government is willing to live in peace with all countries in the world. But China must liberate its own territory of Taiwan, which is purely China's internal affair and brooks no foreign interference. In particular, the Chinese people cannot tolerate the existence of the Chiang Kai-shek group's outposts in their own territorial waters, which threaten their own security and endanger the lives and property of their own people every day, and cannot tolerate American warships sailing in our territorial waters. All this is as clear as the sun in the clear sky, without any ambiguity or room for compromise, and no sane person would express any doubt about it. The Kinmen Chiang Kai-shek group, which deliberately provoked, disregarded the repeated warnings of our People's Liberation Army and shelled the peaceful residents and school students in coastal villages and towns near Xiamen, causing heavy casualties; and the American warships, disregarding the repeated serious warnings of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, repeatedly intruded into our territorial waters. In response to this, our Fujian front artillery units have already taken action on September 8, giving the Kinmen Chiang troops and the Chiang troops' ships protected by American warships a punitive blow. The artillery fire has already begun, and the serious danger caused by American military provocations has greatly increased. The US government now has the opportunity to prevent the escalation of the situation and to resolve the international dispute in the Taiwan Strait through peaceful negotiations. If the American authorities still have peace in mind, they should rein in at the brink of the precipice and stop immediately.

### 美国赶快悬崖勒马

　　美国赶快悬崖勒马
    全国人民的大示威，毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上对美国侵略者的警告，我福建前线炮兵对于在美国侵略者保护下肆意挑衅的金门蒋军及其运输舰只的惩罚：这些就是两天来我国对于美国侵略者的严正答复。
    美国政府现在正在进行着第二次世界大战结束以来最危险的军事冒险。这是最危险的冒险，因为美国所选择的对象是拥有全人类四分之一的人口的大国，这个国家是曾经同美国较量过的，而从那时以来，它无论在政治上、经济上和军事上，都已经更加强大了许多倍。同时，人们不能不注意到，这个国家是同强大的苏联结成同盟的，苏联已经表示，侵犯中国就是侵犯苏联。美国早就侵略过中国的邻邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，因而引起中国人民志愿军的胜利的抗美援朝战争。美国早就侵略中国的领土台湾，而台湾是中国迟早一定要解放的。但是现在的情况同那两次不同。金门、马祖既不是中国的邻国，同中国大陆又没有公海的间隔。美国宣布要帮助蒋介石集团保护金门、马祖，或者保护由台湾通向金门、马祖的运输线，这就使美国陷入随时可能同中国直接发生武力冲突的极端危险的境地。
    美国的决策者可能以为，中国政府9月4日关于领海的声明和9月6日关于中国内政不容美国干涉的声明只是虚声恫吓，因而继续执行着“战争边缘”的政策，继续向中国挑衅。但是这样想的美国人是完全错了。伟大的中华人民共和国决不是那种在敌人的战争威胁面前吓得发软的国家，决不是那种只说不做的国家。全国人民的空前激昂的大示威显示了这一点。全中国人民表示决心，只要祖国号召，就马上拿起武器，走上前线。全世界都知道，美国人尤其知道，中国人是为了争自由而不怕死的人民，中国人是永远不能征服的人民。
    毛泽东主席9月8日在最高国务会议上的讲话准确地说明了中国人民的决心和信心。毛主席指出：美国侵略者侵占我国领土台湾，同侵占黎巴嫩和在许多国家建立了几百个军事基地一样，只是替自己的脖子套上绞索。美国在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势，同在黎巴嫩以及其他地方制造紧张局势一样，起了动员全世界人民起来反对美国侵略者的作用。事实的真相难道不是如此吗？难道美国侵略政策近来的每一次施展，不是越来越显得荒谬和疯狂，不是把美帝国主义越来越推向在国际和国内完全孤立的绝境吗？这种事实难道会让我们在伟大的革命斗争中生长起来的伟大的人民有丝毫害怕吗？美国侵略者的这一套只能去征服那些时刻准备着向美国的原子弹、氢弹和美国小麦、美国金圆屈膝投降的机会主义者，而在我们的创造着新历史的大无畏的人民看来，美国侵略者手里的一切法宝，不过是在人类前进道路上一些还没有扫除、还在散发着臭气的垃圾罢了。美国的决策者们决心非要收紧他们自己套在自己脖子上的绞索不可，那么，就让他们这样做吧！
    中国人民爱好和平，中国政府愿意同世界各国和平相处。但是中国一定要解放自己的领土台湾，这纯粹是中国的内政，绝不容许外国干涉。中国人民尤其不能容忍在自己的领海内存在着每天威胁着自己的安全、危害着自己人民的生命财产的蒋介石集团的前哨阵地，不能容忍美国军舰在我国的领海内行驶。这一切清楚得像晴天的太阳一样，毫无含糊妥协之余地，也没有一个头脑清醒的人对这一切表示任何怀疑。蓄意挑衅的金门蒋介石集团不顾我人民解放军的一再警告，向厦门附近沿海村镇的和平居民和学校学生进行炮击，造成重大伤亡；而美国军舰也不顾我外交部的一再严重警告，一再侵入我国领海活动。对此我福建前线炮兵部队已经在9月8日采取行动，给予金门蒋军和受美国军舰保护的蒋军舰船以惩罚性的打击。炮火已经打响了，美国军事挑衅所造成的严重危险已经大大增加了。美国政府现在还有机会防止事态的扩大，使台湾海峡地区的国际争端通过和平谈判来解决。美国当局如果还以和平为念，应该悬崖勒马，立即住手。
