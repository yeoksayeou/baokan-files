Xinhua News Agency, Miyun, September 1st: North China's largest comprehensive water conservancy project—the Miyun Reservoir—officially commenced construction today.

This massive reservoir is located upstream of the Chao River and Bai River in Miyun County, northeast of the capital. The main projects include two main dams spanning the Chao and Bai Rivers, and more than ten auxiliary dams. It is also necessary to excavate a tunnel, a diversion gallery, three spillways, an emergency spillway, and a power generation tunnel. After the reservoir is completed, it can store 4.1 billion cubic meters of water. The entire project requires the excavation and filling of 23 million cubic meters of earth and stone, twenty times more than the nationally renowned Guanting Reservoir.

After the completion of this reservoir, it will be of great significance for flood control, irrigation, and solving the current water use problems of Beijing and Tianjin. The southern mountainous area of the Chao River basin is a rainstorm center, and extreme floods often occur, endangering vast areas north of Tianjin and east of Beijing. After the reservoir is built, this area will be protected from exceptionally large floods that occur once in a century, and it can also irrigate 4 million mu of farmland and expand cultivated land by 1 million mu. If each mu increases grain production by an average of 500 jin, it can increase grain production by 2.5 billion jin annually.

While building the reservoir, a canal will be excavated from the Miyun Reservoir, passing through the Huairou Reservoir to Kunming Lake in Beijing, and connecting to the future Beijing-Tianjin Canal. In this way, the current shortage of industrial and urban water use in Beijing and Tianjin can be initially resolved, and shipping can be developed. In addition, a hydroelectric power station with an installed capacity of 90,000 kilowatts will be built on the Bai River.

Many preliminary tasks on the reservoir construction site have already begun. All necessary materials, which are scheduled to be supported by relevant departments of the central government and Beijing Municipality for the construction of the reservoir, are being successively transported to the construction site. Cadres dispatched to the construction site by units such as the Beijing Non-Staple Food Company and Supply and Marketing Cooperative, which serve the reservoir builders, are also actively organizing commercial service work. Many farmers from twenty-six counties and districts in Hebei Province and the suburbs of Beijing have already or will soon enter the construction site as needed.

Bright slogans and slogan boards are erected on the hilltops and intersections near the construction site, calling on the reservoir builders to advance towards nature and declare war on the earth.

### 华北最大综合性水利工程  密云水库正式开工

    华北最大综合性水利工程
　　密云水库正式开工
    新华社密云1日电　华北最大的综合性水利工程——密云水库今天开工兴建。
    这座规模巨大的水库位于首都东北密云县境潮河和白河的上游。主要工程有横跨潮、白两河的两座主坝和十多座副坝，还要开挖一条隧洞、一条导流廊道、三条溢洪道和非常溢洪道以及发电隧洞。水库建成后，可以蓄水四十一亿公方。水库全部工程共需开挖、填筑土石方二千三百万方，比全国闻名的官厅水库多二十倍。
    这座水库建成后，对防洪、灌溉和解决目前北京、天津两市的用水问题都有很大意义。潮河流域的南部山区是暴雨中心，经常发生极大洪水，危害天津以北、北京以东的广大地区。水库建成后，这块地区就可以不受百年一遇的特大洪水灾害，还能灌溉农田四百万亩，扩大耕地一百万亩，如以每亩平均增产粮食五百斤计算，每年就可增产二十五亿斤粮食。
    在修建水库同时，将开挖一条从密云水库经过怀柔水库到北京昆明湖的运河，并且同未来的京津运河接通。这样，就可以初步解决目前京津两市的工业和城市用水不足的困难，又能发展航运。另外，还将在白河修建一座装机容量九万瓩的水力发电站。
    水库工地上的许多先行工作早已开始。预定由中央和北京市有关部门支援水库建设的一切必须物资，正在陆续运往工地。为水库建设者服务的北京市副食品公司和供销合作社等单位抽派到工地的干部，也都在积极组织商业服务工作。河北省和北京郊区二十六个县、区的许多农民，已经或即将根据需要陆续进入工地。
   工地附近的山头和路口竖立着鲜艳的标语和标语牌，号召水库建设者向大自然进军，向地球宣战。
