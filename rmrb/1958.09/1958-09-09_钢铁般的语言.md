　　Steel-like Language

　　At the National Conference on the Exchange of Experiences in Medical and Health Technology Revolution currently being held in Beijing, nearly a thousand representatives from all corners of the country issued a common oath: "Prepared at any time to contribute everything to the liberation of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands and other islands of the motherland, resolutely swear to the Party and Chairman Mao, we will never give up until the task is completed." Many representatives also took the stage to speak, denouncing the heinous acts of military provocations and war threats by US imperialism, and expressing that they would do whatever the Party wanted them to do, and go wherever the Party wanted them to go.
　　The duty of medical workers is to heal the wounded and rescue the dying for humanity, and to contribute their energy and intelligence to human happiness. Therefore, they will absolutely not allow war maniacs to run rampant in creating hatred and manufacturing death. Under the leadership of the Party, medical workers in New China have made many life-saving contributions in medical care, and will also make their own contributions to the struggle to crush the military provocations and war threats of war maniacs who manufacture death.
　　The moving example of the medical staff of Shanghai Guangci Hospital, under the leadership of the Party organization, curing Qiu CaiKang, who had burns covering more than 89% of his body, inspired the people of the whole country and shattered the theories of American authorities on treating burns. Such miracles not only appeared in Shanghai, but also in an ordinary hospital in Chongqing, where more than ten patients with burns covering more than 80% of their bodies, who were previously thought to be certain to die, were cured. Other places such as Hunan and Hebei have also seen such miracles. Under the leadership of the Party, many medical workers, inspired by the moving deeds of rescuing Qiu CaiKang, spared no effort to sacrifice their sleep for several consecutive days, and even donated their own blood and skin, to try to rescue critically ill patients who were previously considered incurable, and brought patients back from the brink of death. The emergence of these miracles is the result of the Party pulling out white flags and planting red flags on the medical and health front. The Party's policy of ideological transformation for intellectuals, the Party's rectification movement, and the policy of liberating the mind, have changed the mental outlook of medical workers, eliminated the superstition of European and American old and pseudo-medicine, promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, thereby enabling them to achieve the results of healing the wounded and rescuing the dying in their medical work.
　　Many of the inventions and creations at this experience exchange meeting mostly came from the broad masses and ordinary medical workers, and some were created by the combination of "foreign experts" and local experts from the intellectual class from the bourgeoisie or petty bourgeoisie after ideological transformation. Medical workers are rejoicing in the achievements they have created and are encouraged by the leap forward development of the motherland's socialist construction. Now, in order to defend the motherland and oppose aggression, they have issued steel-like language. They will use the forceps and sharp knives of healing the wounded and rescuing the dying to pull out the teeth of the paper tiger and cut off the claws it is waving!

　　钢铁般的语言
　　辛蕴教
    正在北京举行的全国医药卫生技术革命经验交流会上，来自全国各个角落的近千个代表，发出了一个共同誓言：“准备随时为解放祖国的台湾和澎湖等岛贡献一切，坚决向党和毛主席宣誓，任务不完成决不罢休。”不少代表还登台讲话，怒斥美帝国主义的军事挑衅和战争威胁的罪恶行为，并表示党要他们干什么他们就干什么，党要他们到哪里他们就到哪里。
    医务工作人员的职责是为人类救死扶伤、为人类幸福贡献自己的精力和聪敏才智，因而他们是绝对不会允许战争疯子为制造仇恨、制造死亡而猖狂的。新中国的医务工作人员，在党的领导下，在医务方面作出了许多起死回生的贡献，也将在粉碎战争疯子制造死亡的军事挑衅和战争威胁的斗争中作出自己的贡献。
    上海广慈医院的医务人员在党组织领导下治愈烧伤面积在89％以上的丘财康的动人事例，振奋了全国人民，打破了美国治疗火伤权威的理论。这样的奇迹不仅出现在上海，在重庆的一个普通医院，也出现过治愈了十多个烧伤面积达80％以上的一向以为非死不可的病人。其他如湖南、河北等地也都出现过这种奇迹。许多医务人员在党的领导下，受到抢救丘财康的动人事迹的鼓舞，不惜接连数天地牺牲自己的睡眠，甚至献出自己的鲜血和皮肤，努力抢救过去认为不能救活的垂危病人，把病人从死亡的边缘抢救回来。这些奇迹的出现，都是党在医药卫生战线上拔白旗、插红旗的结果。党对知识分子改造思想的政策，党的整风运动、解放思想的政策，使医务工作人员的精神面貌改观，破除了对欧美旧医学伪医学的迷信，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，从而使他们在医疗工作中取得了救死扶伤、起死回生的成绩。
    在这次经验交流会上的许多创造发明，大部分来自广大的群众和平凡的医务工作者中间，一部分则是由经过思想改造的出身于资产阶级或小资产阶级的知识分子的“洋专家”和土专家结合而创造的。医务工作者正为自己创造的业绩而高兴，为祖国的社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展而鼓舞。现在他们为了保卫祖国、反对侵略，发出了钢铁般的语言。他们将用救死扶伤的镊子和利刀，把纸老虎张着的牙拔掉，舞着的爪砍断！
