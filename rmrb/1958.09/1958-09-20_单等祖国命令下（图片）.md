    Just Waiting for the Motherland's Order
    In the sky, swift divine eagles are speeding,
    On the coast, a forest of cannons stands tall;
    On the sea, brave and battle-hardened steeds are galloping,
    In the deep sea, dragons capable of stirring up the rivers and overturning the seas are hidden.
    Just waiting for the motherland's order,
    Heroes are about to cross the sea on an expedition;
    Vowing to transform hatred into flames,
    Let the enemy be reduced to ashes in the raging fire!

    单等祖国命令下
    天空飞驰着矫健的神鹰，
    海岸雄立着火炮的森林；
    海面奔跑着骁勇善战的骏马，
    海底深藏着翻江倒海的蛟龙。
    单等祖国一声令下，
    英雄就要跨海出征；
    誓把仇恨化为火焰，
    让敌人在烈火中化为灰烬！
    剑影　诗，邓钧照、陈文辉摄
