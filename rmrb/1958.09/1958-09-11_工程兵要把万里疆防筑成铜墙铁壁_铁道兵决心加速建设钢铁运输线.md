Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: More than four hundred technical experts who converged in the capital to participate in the National Engineering Corps and Construction Troops Technical Innovation Experience Exchange Conference stated that they resolutely support Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council meeting and Premier Zhou's statement, vowing to contribute all their strength to defending the security of the motherland and liberating Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan. They initiated a proposal to all military construction troops: immediately take action, make all combat preparations, accelerate the completion of engineering construction tasks, and build the vast border defense of the great motherland into an impregnable fortress.

With the spirit of "mountains bowing their heads, rivers yielding the way," the engineering heroes of the various construction troops expressed their confidence in building and defending the national defense, and defeating the invaders. Engineering soldiers fighting on the front lines of Fujian are bravely cooperating with fraternal units to strengthen the construction of coastal defense positions, setting up inescapable nets for the enemy. Captain Fan Zhongxiu, an outstanding technical innovation expert, said indignantly: "If the American imperialist wolves insist on running rampant and interfering in our country's internal affairs, we will definitely tighten the noose around their necks and sentence them to death!" Officers and soldiers of a certain pontoon bridge unit, who had fought bravely against the perils of the Yellow River during this year's floods and built a temporary Yellow River bridge at the fastest speed, expressed with full confidence that they have every assurance of cooperating with and supporting fraternal units in victorious combat at any time, eliminating any enemy who dares to venture and invade.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: All officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army resolutely support Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council meeting and Premier Zhou's statement, protest the military threats and war provocations of American imperialism with incomparable anger, and are determined to accelerate the construction of steel transportation lines, vowing to fight to the end to defend the motherland, liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and liberate Taiwan.

All representatives participating in the Railway Corps' Fourth-Level Cadre Conference unanimously stated that they must immediately strengthen combat readiness work, defend the motherland's steel transportation lines; resolutely implement the Party's General Line, build railways more, faster, better, and more economically, so as to rapidly enhance the motherland's national defense strength and economic strength.

In recent days, various Railway Corps units fighting on the railway construction fronts in the north and south of the motherland have held rallies at construction sites to protest the crimes of the American robbers invading our country's territorial waters. Officers and soldiers are transforming anger into strength, accelerating project construction with selfless and creative labor. The troops constructing the Min-Dian Railway Min-Gan line on the Fujian front are determined to complete the railway to Quanzhou ahead of schedule. The troops constructing the Nanping-Fuzhou Railway have also launched a greater leap forward, striving to get the train to Fuzhou earlier. The troops opening mountains and splitting ridges to build the Neijiang-Kunming Railway on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau have also greatly accelerated the progress of the project, with five tunnels more than 1,500 meters long starting construction ahead of schedule.
