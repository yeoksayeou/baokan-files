Science and Practice
Cui Pengyun

Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, in the resounding waves of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, a mass technical revolution movement has unfolded, and many miracle-creating "native" experts have emerged. Their inventions and creations have played an outstanding role in the leap forward in production. This mass-based invention and creation is truly sweeping like a storm, blooming everywhere, with a "sweeping the world" momentum, demonstrating the power of the working people of socialist countries to transform nature. Many scientific and technical workers are delighted by this, and their thinking has also been liberated. They are willing to wholeheartedly combine the practical experience and inventions of the masses to develop scientific undertakings and serve production practice. However, some others still cannot bear to discard the habits and views of the old intellectuals, and they look down upon the many inventions and creations of the masses with cold eyes. One of their arguments is that these "native" methods have no "scientific basis," that predecessors have not said it, predecessors have not done it, and it is not recorded in the "literature," that it is accidental and "unreliable." This argument shows that they have not yet understood the relationship between science and practice.

Scientific workers should respect reality and treat things scientifically. They should know what the source of scientific knowledge is and what the application of scientific knowledge relies on. Does it rely on the production practice and struggle practice of the broad masses, or does it rely on the empty imagination of a few people? Here we should carefully study Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice." He pointed out, "Practice is the criterion of truth," "Many natural science theories are called truth not only when natural scientists created these theories, but also when they are confirmed by subsequent scientific practice," "Discovering truth through practice, and then confirming and developing truth through practice." From this, he summed up a famous formula for exploring science: "Practice, knowledge, re-practice, re-knowledge." This answers a series of fundamental questions we want to discuss: What is science, and what is not science? We can say that the truth that has been tested and verified by practice is science, otherwise it is not. What is the purpose of scientific research? We can say that it is for practice, for transforming the world, not for scientific research for the sake of scientific research. How to study science? We can say that we should summarize the practical experience of the broad masses, raise it to a theoretical height, and then use it in the practice of the masses to verify, supplement, enrich, and develop it, and to guide practice. From this, it can be seen that scientific workers must not be superstitious about books. Books contain the experience of summarizing the practice of predecessors and things that have been tested by practice, but there are also things that are outdated, and some are even bourgeois idealist things that are neither a summary of social practice nor can withstand the test of social practice. Therefore, we must focus on the practical aspect, use practice to examine past theories, and use practice to develop current science. Some people are unwilling to contact reality and are unwilling to combine the current production leap forward to solve scientific problems in production, which is of course wrong. Because if science is separated from reality, does not proceed from reality, and is not applied to reality, it will be impossible to distinguish what is called science and what is not science. It is not enough to call oneself science.

Some scientific workers believe that they have "the highest level of theory," but the wheat they tested based on their profound theory can only yield hundreds of catties per mu; the peasants do not understand that "highest level of theory," but the wheat in the experimental field can yield seven or eight thousand catties per mu. Faced with such facts, can scientific workers remain unmoved? A yield of several thousand catties per mu has far surpassed the world's highest production level. Summarizing and improving such practical experience is the world's highest level of agricultural science. In the leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, many new problems have been raised, which are urgently waiting for scientific workers to solve. This means that the needs of social practice will greatly push the cause of science forward, just as Engels said: "If a technical need arises in society, it will promote science more than ten universities." We are in such a period. Are not the various initiatives that have emerged in various aspects of construction a great encouragement to scientific theory? Because it can be continuously enriched and developed; is this not a solemn review of past theories? Because it can be used to eliminate the crude and retain the essence, eliminate the false and retain the true. Therefore, we ask scientific workers to emancipate their minds, combine with the production practice of the broad masses, go all out, aim high, and strive for high speed in industrial and agricultural production, and promote the leap forward development of science. Relying solely on a few people, a few scientific workers, and solely on personal research in the laboratory, while neglecting the creative power of the broad masses, can in no way adapt to the requirements of science and technology in socialist construction. Saying this is by no means belittling the role of learning scientific theory, but rather requiring that scientific theory be quickly combined with production practice, and that it quickly play a major role in production.

Originally, we are doing undertakings that predecessors have not done, but they insist on using the footprints of predecessors to restrict the way for future generations; originally, the law of the development of things is from nothing to something, from small to large, from incomplete to complete, but they dare not boldly create, but ridicule others' new creations as unscientific and imperfect. This is because of the lack of scientific social viewpoints and ideological methods. Engels, in criticizing general science and philosophy for neglecting the role of practice in cognition, said: "They only know nature on the one hand, and only know thinking on the other hand. But the most essential and closest basis of human thinking is precisely the changes in nature caused by man, and not nature itself alone; human intelligence develops according to how man learns to change nature." (Dialectics of Nature) This means that it is far from enough for natural scientists to simply acknowledge the objective existence of matter. They must correctly understand the relationship between existence and thinking, the relationship between knowledge and practice, which is to require scientific workers to study dialectical materialism well. The reason why the Party and the state require scientific workers to be "both red and expert" lies in this.

It needs to be emphasized that there is no intention to belittle the learning of scientific theory and scientists here. Many facts of the leap forward in the scientific community in the current Great Leap Forward situation have shown that scientific workers with a scientific theoretical foundation, if they can emancipate their minds, dare to think and dare to do, then they will achieve achievements, even greater and more achievements. Moreover, one of the reasons why these "native" experts with inventions and creations have achieved scientific achievements is that many people have also touched the laws of science after diligently studying science and technology books, consulting technical personnel, and consulting with experienced masters, and after many scientific experiments. Therefore, scientific workers should not look down on them in the first place, but should first learn from them the spirit of being "both red and expert," and then cooperate closely, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and help each other. In this way can we make greater contributions to socialist construction.

    科学与实践
    崔鹏云
    在总路线光辉的照耀下，在工农业生产大跃进的声浪中，群众性的技术革命运动展开了，涌现出了许多创造奇迹的“土”专家。他们的创造发明对生产跃进起了卓越的作用。这种群众性的创造发明，真是风起云涌，遍地开花，大有“席卷天下”之势，显示出了社会主义国家劳动人民改造自然的威力。许多科学技术工作者对此欢欣鼓舞，思想也随之解放，愿意全心全力结合群众的实践经验和创造发明，发展科学事业，为生产实践服务。但是另有一些人，还是不忍丢掉旧知识分子的习气和观点，对群众的这许多创造发明，冷眼旁观，看不起。他们的论调之一就是，这些“土”办法没有“科学根据”，前人没有说过，前人没有做过，“文献”上也没有记载过，是偶然的，“不可靠”。这种论调说明，他们还没有懂得科学与实践的关系。
    科学工作者应该尊重实际和科学地对待事物，应该知道科学知识的来源和科学知识的应用到底是依靠什么。是依靠广大群众的生产实践和斗争实践呢，还是依靠少数人的凭空想像？在这里我们应该好好地学习毛泽东同志的“实践论”，他指出，“实践是真理的标准”，“许多自然科学理论之所以被称为真理，不但在于自然科学家们创立这些学说的时候，而且在于为尔后的科学实践所证实的时候”，“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理”。他由此总结出一个探求科学的著名的公式：“实践，认识，再实践，再认识。”这就回答了我们所要讨论的一系列的根本问题：什么是科学，什么不是科学？我们可以说，经过实践检验证实了的真理才是科学，否则就不是。科学研究到底为了什么？我们可以说，是为了实践，是为了改造世界，不是为科学研究而研究科学。怎样研究科学？我们可以说，要总结广大群众的实践经验，使之上升到理论高度，然后再把它用到群众实践中去证实、补充、丰富、发展，去指导实践。由此可见，科学工作者决不可以迷信书本，书本中有总结前人实践的经验，并经过实践检验的东西，但也有过时了的东西，有的甚至既不是社会实践的总结，又经不起社会实践的考验的资产阶级唯心主义的东西。所以我们必须着重于实践方面，用实践来检查过去的理论，用实践来发展现在的科学。有些人偏偏不愿意接触实际，不愿意结合当前生产跃进来解决生产中的科学问题，这当然是不对的。因为科学如果离开实际，不从实际出发，不应用于实际，就分不出什么叫科学，什么叫不科学，光自命为科学是不行的。
    有的科学工作者自认为有“最高水平的理论”，可是他根据自己的高深理论试验的小麦只能亩产几百斤；农民们不懂得那“最高水平的理论”，可是试验田里的小麦却能亩产七八千斤。面对这样的事实，科学工作者们能无所动心吗？亩产几千斤，已经远远超越了世界最高生产水平，把这样的实践经验加以总结、提高，就是世界最高水平的农业科学。在工农业生产飞跃发展中，许多新的问题提出来了，正迫切地等待着科学工作者们去解决。这就是说，社会实践的需要将大大地把科学事业推向前进，正如恩格斯所说：“倘若社会上出现了一种技术上的需要，那就比十个大学还更能推动科学前进。”我们就是处在这样一个时期，这个时期在建设的各个方面所出现的各种创举，对于科学理论来说不是一个很大的鼓舞吗？因为它可以得到不断的丰富和发展；这对于过去的理论来说不是一个庄严的检阅吗？因为它可以借此去粗取精、去伪存真。所以我们要求科学工作者必须解放思想，与广大群众的生产实践结合起来，鼓足干劲，力争上游，才能在工农业生产上力争高速度，才能推动科学事业向前飞跃发展。仅靠少数人、少数科学工作者，仅靠在研究室的个人研究，而忽视广大群众的创造力量，无论如何也不能够适应社会主义建设中对于科学技术的要求的。这样说决不是贬低学习科学理论的作用，而是要求把科学理论赶快和生产实践结合起来，赶快使它在生产中发挥重大作用。
    本来我们办的是前人没有办过的事业，而他们硬要用前人的脚印来限制后人走路；本来事物的发展规律是从无到有，从小到大，从不完全到完全，而他们既不敢大胆创造，却又讥笑别人新的创造不科学、不完善。这就是没有科学的社会观点和思想方法的缘故。恩格斯在批评一般科学和哲学忽视实践在认识中的作用时说：“它们一方面只知道自然界，另一方面只知道思维。但是人的思维之最本质的和最密切的基础，却恰恰是人所引起的自然界的变化，而非单独是自然界本身；人的智力是按照人如何学会改变自然界而发展的。”（自然辩证法）这就是说，自然科学家单承认物质的客观存在还是远远不够的，必须正确地了解存在与思维的关系，知识与实践的关系，这就是要科学工作者好好学习辩证唯物主义。党和国家要求科学工作者“又红又专”的道理正在于此。
    需要强调说明一下，在这里决没有轻视学习科学理论和科学家的意思，目前大跃进的形势中，科学界很多跃进的事实已经表明，有科学理论基础的科学工作者，如果他们能解放思想，敢想敢做，那末就会做出成就，甚至做出更大更多的成就。而且，这些有发明创造的“土”专家，取得科学成就的原因之一，许多人也是由于自己刻苦钻研了科学技术书籍，向技术人员请教，向老师傅请教，并经过许多次的科学试验才摸到了科学的规律。因此，科学工作者首先不要看不起他们，而是首先要向他们学习“又红又专”的精神，然后亲密合作，取长补短，互相帮助。这样才能对社会主义建设做出更大的贡献。
