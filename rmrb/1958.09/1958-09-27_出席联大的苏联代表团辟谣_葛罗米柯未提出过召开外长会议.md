Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 26th (TASS): The Soviet delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly held a press conference on the 25th. The following statement was read at the meeting:

    The "New York Post" published an article signed by Leish on September 25th, stating that during a meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd on September 23rd, they discussed the possibility of convening a meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the situation in the Far East, and that the Soviet Foreign Minister expressed a positive attitude towards this suggestion.

    The Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to state that the Soviet Foreign Minister and the British Foreign Secretary did not raise the issue of convening a meeting of foreign ministers during the aforementioned meeting. Therefore, there was no discussion, nor could there have been a discussion, on this issue. It is clear that the "New York Post's" report is fabricated.

    出席联大的苏联代表团辟谣
    葛罗米柯未提出过召开外长会议
    新华社26日讯  塔斯社纽约26日讯：出席联合国大会的苏联代表团25日举行了记者招待会。会上宣读了如下声明：
    “纽约邮报”9月25日刊登了列什署名的文章说，9月23日苏联外交部长葛罗米柯同英国外交大臣劳埃德在会见时，谈到了召开外长会议来讨论远东局势的可能性问题，文章并且说苏联外交部长对这个建议表现了肯定的态度。
    苏联代表团认为必须声明，苏联外交部长和英国外交大臣在上述会见时间中，没有提出过关于召开外长会议的问题，因此，没有讨论过也不可能讨论这个问题。可见，“纽约邮报”的消息显然是捏造的。
