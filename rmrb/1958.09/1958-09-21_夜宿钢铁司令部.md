    Overnight Stay at the Steel Headquarters
    Ting Jun, Zong Tang

    We were interviewing at the March 8th Women's Iron Smelting Site in Zhangjiashan, and before we knew it, it was midnight. At this moment, a young man suddenly came to us and said he was the secretary of the headquarters, and the commander invited us to stay at the headquarters tonight.

    During the daytime interview, we already knew that the commander's surname was Wang, who was the district head of this area. We had wanted to meet him and learn about the situation for a long time, but we were always out of luck and couldn't find him. Now, we are so grateful for his kindness in sending a secretary to pick us up.

    The sparse starlight in the sky did not diminish the dimness of the deep mountains and old forests. Relying on the flashlight, we walked along the rugged path, one foot high and one foot low. Li Secretary, who was leading the way, started telling us stories along the way: "You probably haven't heard of our mountain in Chengdu. Don't underestimate it; it's a treasure mountain. You can pick up iron ore just by bending over. Some old people say that some of the ore is no different from pure iron and can be used directly to make farm tools." "Then why didn't you open it up in the past?" "We weren't ideologically liberated. We thought that to open an iron mine, we had to build a big factory. We didn't expect that it could be done with hoes. Who knew that the farmers in the surrounding villages already had this idea? As soon as the district gave the order, thousands of men, women, old, and young came with tools and rations. Our headquarters was established urgently at the construction site at that time..."

    Walking and talking, for about an hour, in the gloomy embrace of the mountains, the outline of a rectangular building appeared. Li Secretary said, "We're here, it's upstairs." We followed him up the open-air stairs. At the entrance at the end of the stairs, we used a flashlight to illuminate a large red flag, fluttering in the wind, with the words "First Army of Steel Production in Yongnian District, Fushun County" written on it. Entering the building, we shone the flashlight around, and people were sleeping haphazardly on the ground. The drill bits, iron hammers, carrying poles, and other tools used for mining and road construction were placed tightly beside them. The snoring was like the tide in the sea, rising and falling.

    Li Secretary led us gently through this group of sleepers into a small room separated by wooden boards in a corner of the building. Commander Wang was not there. A girl with pigtails was working at the table by the window. There was a telephone and a kerosene lamp on the table. We thought the commander would be back soon because it was already late. While waiting for him, we took a look at the surroundings. On the wall in the center of the room hung a military organizational chart written in red letters. The chart stated that the district head was the army commander, and the district party secretary was the army political commissar; the army headquarters commanded a combat regiment (for iron smelting), an artillery regiment (for mining), a March 8th Women's Battalion (for both mining and iron smelting), as well as a military supplies and logistics department in charge of transportation and supplies, and a political department in charge of ideological education. On another wall hung the honor roll of the entire army, which was already filled with dense names. In the corner of the wall facing the door was a long bench, on which were displayed dozens of bowls containing various ores. The ores were labeled with their names, origins, etc. Particularly noteworthy was that these ores were discovered in the past few days.

    We waited and waited, but Commander Wang did not come back. Li Secretary came in from outside with a bedding roll and said to us, "He doesn't have a fixed time to come back every day, and sometimes he stays at the construction site. You've been running around all day, you must be tired, rest first, and we'll talk about anything tomorrow." It was almost two o'clock, and we were really sleepy, so the two of us shared a quilt and quickly fell asleep.

    However, in this small room, people kept coming in and out right next to our heads, and that telephone showed its power in the middle of the night, and the ringing woke us up several times. As before, every time the bell rang, Li Secretary's voice followed: "Hello! Hello, hello! We must take it down tonight, this is Commander Wang's order... Overcome the difficulties yourselves, the road to the mountain must be opened tomorrow... The charcoal that other districts are supporting us with will be delivered soon... Be quick, be quick!" After a burst of shouting, it stopped for a while and then started again, "Yongding (village name)? ... Iron is being produced... All the furnaces? Great, great.... The ore can't keep up? ... I knew it, Commander Wang has led five hundred workers and has already set off overnight to mine ore for you, guaranteed to be delivered by dawn...".

    The next morning, we got up at a little after five o'clock. At this time, Li Secretary and the girl were engrossed in working at the table, and it was very likely that they had not slept last night. When we turned over, we found that another tarpaulin had been added next to us, with an un-folded quilt on it. Before we could ask, Li Secretary apologized and said, "I'm really sorry, Commander Wang came back for a while last night and slept next to you, he wouldn't let us wake you up, unexpectedly something urgent happened at the construction site, and he rushed to solve it, and it seems that he won't be back for a while..."

    Because we had to rush to another place for an interview, we couldn't wait any longer and had to say goodbye to Li Secretary. Stepping out of the room, the outside room was already empty, and not a single person could be seen. The sky was not yet bright, and a drizzling autumn rain was falling. However, the sound of cannons and people's shouts, songs, and laughter from the surrounding mountains had already converged into a boiling ocean.

    夜宿钢铁司令部
    挺军、宗棠
    我们在张家山三八妇女营炼铁工地上采访，不知不觉就到了深夜十二点钟。这时，一位年青小伙子突然到了我们跟前，他说他是司令部的秘书，司令员请我们今晚上去司令部住宿。
    在白天的采访中，我们已经知道司令员姓汪，就是这个区的区长。我们早就想和他见见面，了解一些情况，可是机缘不巧，总是会不到他。现在，承他如此盛情，派秘书来接我们去，这可再好没有了。
    天上疏疏落落的星光，并没有减轻深山老林的昏暗。靠着手电筒，我们沿着崎岖的羊肠小道，一脚低一脚高地走着。在前面领路的李秘书，一路上给我们摆开了龙门阵：“我们这座山，你们在成都没有听说过吧，别看它不出名，可真是一座宝山，弯弯腰都能拣到铁矿。听有些老辈子人谈，有几处出的矿石和纯铁没啥差别，拿去直接就能打农具。”“那么，你们过去为啥不赶快开呢？”“思想没解放嘛，我们想，要开铁矿非办大工厂不可，没想到用锄头也行。谁知四乡农民早就有这个意思了，区里一个号令下去，男的女的，老的少的，几千人带着工具、口粮赶来了。我们的司令部就是那时在工地上紧急成立的……”
    走着说着，约摸有一个小时的光景，在阴沉的群山环抱中，出现了一座长方形楼房的轮廓，李秘书说：“到了，就在这楼上。”我们跟着走上了露天楼梯，在楼梯尽头入门处，用电筒照出这里插着一面大红旗，迎风飘扬，上面写着“富顺县永念区钢铁生产第一军”字样。进入楼房里面，我们用电筒晃了一晃，地下横七竖八睡的都是人，开矿、修路用的炮钎、铁锤、扁担等工具就紧摆在身边，呼噜呼噜的打鼾声像海里的浪潮一般，此起彼伏。
    李秘书带我们轻步穿过这群酣睡者，进到楼房一角用木板隔开的一个小房间。汪司令员不在，一个梳双辫子的姑娘正伏在窗户边的桌子上工作。桌上放了一架电话机、一盏煤油灯。我们想司令员不久就会回来的，因为时间已经不早了，一边等他，一边顺便看了看四周的陈设。屋子正中的墙上挂着一张用红字写的军部编制图，图上写着这个区区长是军司令员、区委书记是军政治委员；军部管辖一个战斗团（炼铁的）、一个炮兵团（挖矿的）、一个三八妇女营（又挖矿又炼铁），还有管运输给养的军需后勤部、管思想教育的政治部等。在另一面墙上挂着全军的光荣榜，上面已写满了密密麻麻的名字。对着门的墙角上放着一张长凳子，上面陈列着几十只盛着各种矿石的碗。矿石上都贴有标签，注明名称、来历等，特别引人注目的是这些矿石是前几天发现的。
    我们等呀等的还没见汪司令员回来。李秘书从外面挟着一个铺盖卷进来，对我们说：“他每天回来没有一定时间，有时就住在工地上。你们跑了一天够累啦，先休息吧，有啥事情明天再谈好了。”这时已快二点了，我们也实在困倦了，于是就两人合盖一条被子，很快就入睡了。
    可是，在这个小屋里，不时有人就在我们的头跟前进进出出，而那架电话机在这深夜里更显出它的威力，叮令令的铃声几次把我们吵醒。照样，每次铃响后紧接着就是李秘书的声音：“喂！喂喂！今晚非拿下不可，这是汪司令员的命令……有困难自己克服，明天上山的公路一定要修通……外区支援我们的木炭马上就要运到……要快、快！”一阵嚷声过后停不多久就又开始了，“永定（乡名）吗？……都出铁了……全部炉子？太好了、太好了……。矿石跟不上？……早知道了，汪司令员带了五百个民工已经连夜出发给你们挖矿石去了，保证天明送到……”。
    第二天清早，我们五点多钟就起床了，这时李秘书和那位姑娘已聚精会神地伏在桌上工作了，很可能他们昨晚就没有睡觉。在我们翻身起来时，发现就在我们旁边又添了一块油布，放着一条没有叠的被子。没等我们问，李秘书就抱歉地说：“实在对不起，汪司令员昨晚回来了一下，就睡在你们旁边，他不让叫醒你们，想不到工地上出了一件紧事，他又赶去解决去了，看情况一时不会回来的……”
    我们因为要赶到另一个地方采访，不能再久等了，只得和李秘书告别。走出房门，外面屋子已经空空荡荡不见一人了，天还没有大亮，天上下着绵绵秋雨。但是，四面山上的炮声和人们的喧嚷声、歌声、笑声早已汇合成一个沸腾的海洋了。
