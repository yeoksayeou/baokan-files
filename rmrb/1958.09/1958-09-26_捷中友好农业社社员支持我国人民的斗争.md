Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 24th.  Herman, the director of the "Czechoslovak-Chinese Friendship" Unified Agricultural Cooperative in Vinarice, Czechoslovakia, told our reporter on the 24th that we fully agree with the recent statement made by Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi regarding Dulles' speech at the United Nations General Assembly. If the American imperialists dare to disregard repeated warnings and impose war on the Chinese people, we will definitely support you with all our strength.

Recently, the members of this cooperative have been very concerned about the Chinese people's struggle against the military provocations of American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait. They said, "Every morning when we turn on the radio, the thing we care about most is the reports on this matter. We love the Chinese people; the American imperialists' provocations against the Chinese people are provocations against us."

The entire membership of this cooperative recently passed a resolution expressing their protest against the provocative actions of American imperialism and their support for the just struggle of the Chinese people.

    捷中友好农业社社员支持我国人民的斗争
    据新华社布拉格24日电  捷克斯洛伐克维纳尔日采村“捷中友好”统一农业合作社社长赫尔曼24日对本社记者说，我们完全同意中国外交部长陈毅最近就杜勒斯在联大的发言所发表的声明。如果美帝国主义竟敢不顾一再的警告，将战争强加于中国人民，我们一定全力支持你们。
    最近一个时期，这个合作社的社员十分关心中国人民反对美帝国主义在台湾海峡进行军事挑衅的斗争。他们说，我们每天早晨一打开收音机，最关心的事就是有关这方面的报道。我们热爱中国人民，美帝国主义对中国人民的挑衅就是对我们的挑衅。
    这个合作社的全体社员最近通过了一个决议，表示对美帝国主义的挑衅行为的抗议和对中国人民正义斗争的支持。
