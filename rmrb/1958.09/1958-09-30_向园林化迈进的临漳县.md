    Linzhang County Advances Towards Landscaping
    Wang Jiahua
    Linzhang County is located at the southern tip of Hebei Province, with the Zhang River traversing the entire area. Like many places ravaged by harmful rivers, Linzhang County has had years of tragic experiences. Half of the county's 800,000 mu of cultivated land is sandy, wind-prone land, and there are also 80,000 mu of sandy wasteland. The river often breached its banks and flooded, with frequent water, drought, wind, and sand disasters, and the masses have always lived a hard life. After liberation, based on the spirit of controlling the river by relying on the river, controlling the sand by treating the sand, fighting for grain from the land, and having the sandy wasteland repay its debts, the county vigorously afforested and cultivated forests. From 1949 to 1957, more than 59,000 mu of forest were planted, and more than 7.9 million trees were planted beside villages, houses, roads, and rivers. After afforestation, 80,000 mu of sandy wasteland have begun to be stabilized, and patches of fertile land have appeared on more than 200,000 mu of sandy land. The county's grain yield per mu has increased from more than 100 jin in the past to 300 jin, and this grain-deficient county has become a surplus-grain county. This spring, the county launched another upsurge of afforestation with thousands of troops and horses. The people of the county worked hard for fifteen days, afforesting more than 20,000 mu and completing the planting of 33 million trees around the four sides, realizing the first step in greening.
    After the spring afforestation, rows of trees already line the rural avenues and the nearly thousand miles of main and branch irrigation canals throughout the county; the banks of the ancient Zhang River, which has existed for thousands of years, have been planted with protective forests; and the desolate beaches left over from the past have also been covered with green new clothes. Duanwang Village in Linzhang County, surrounded by sand on all sides, has now been completely transformed: willow trees line the newly opened avenues, followed by rows of grape seedlings, then a narrow flower bed, and surrounding the village are five forest belts of apple, apricot, pear, mulberry, and grape gardens, with lush green locust forests complementing the farmland with lush crops and the pastures with abundant water and grass, making the scenery exceptionally beautiful.
    Linzhang County, which has achieved the first step in greening, has not stopped there. The county party committee further analyzed the county's afforestation situation, found that the potential was still great, and proposed that on the basis of the current average of 1,250 trees per household, after a great battle this winter and next spring, each person will have an average of 10,000 trees. The specific methods are to expand the afforestation area, sweep up remnants, fill gaps, update tree varieties, and thoroughly green all possible greening areas, to achieve beautification and fragrance.
    At the end of August, the county realized the people's commune system. The people of the county are determined to strive for the early realization of rural landscaping and put forward the following specific requirements:
    Greening of sandy wasteland oasis. This winter and next spring, compress the Zhang River channel, afforest 100,000 mu, so that the trees are staggered; in dangerous areas, all create goose-wing forests; the basically greened sandy wasteland should be replanted according to the requirements of 400 to 600 plants per mu, to achieve "Good scenery on both sides of the Zhang River, no difference between rural and urban areas, a green expanse of forest oases and seas, forest belts and networks of trees forming walls, trees connecting trees all over the county, and trees stretching as far as the eye can see in the fields."
    Canal forest networkization and mulberry gardenization. The county has three major canals, Tonghe, Minyou, and Taiping, totaling 600 li in length. Three to five rows of trees should be planted on both sides of the canals, with a total of more than 16 million trees planted, including 6 million mulberry trees. Combine planting mulberry trees with vigorous silkworm breeding, to achieve "Looking at the canal from afar, it is a green forest, looking closely, the forest network is shaded by trees, the river flows with green water, the sand does not rise in the wind, walk to the side of the canal to pick mulberries, every household is busy raising silkworms, silk is woven into satin, and everyone wears good clothes."
    Highway forest wallization and standardization. Major transportation arteries should be built into 10-meter-wide highways, and simple highways should be built between townships and fields for agricultural machinery, with three to five rows of trees planted on the roadsides, totaling 4 million trees, to achieve "Highways forming networks, trees forming walls, evergreen in winter and summer, birds singing and flowers fragrant."
    Village forestation, rural urbanization, ring-town forest ditching, village greening, beautification, fragrance, cleaning, and parkification. Every township has a ring-town forest and a ring-town ditch, with weeping willows and fruit trees planted on the banks, and lotus flowers and fish raised in the ditch. Neat, uniform, wide, and flat roads should be built in the township, with trees planted on the roadsides. The main streets have flower beds, with grape trellises and wisteria frames next to the beds. In order to achieve rural parkification, three to five pavilions are built in front of each township club. After returning from labor, the working people can rest, sing, listen to radio broadcasts, read newspapers, and play chess in the pavilions. It is: "Elm trees nod to welcome people, locust trees are fragrant with white flowers, poplar leaves clap their hands and laugh, toon trees hang golden plaques, pine and cypress are evergreen and people do not age, peach, pear, apricot, and persimmon will never fail."
    Township bee farm fish pondization. Beekeeping and fish farming not only increase sideline production and improve people's lives, but also eliminate mosquitoes and flies and improve environmental sanitation. This constitutes the picture: "Dense locust and poplar trees with long catkins, birds singing and flowers fragrant in all seasons, five forests surrounding the village evergreen all year round, fish swimming in the ponds flashing silver light, fresh fruits hanging on the trees in autumn, wheat, beans, and millet piled up in warehouses, old things go and new things come with joy, the socialist scenery is good."
    County forest farmization, farm industrialization. It is required to achieve "The county's forest farms are like the ocean, pigs and sheep are fed under the big trees, chickens and ducks lay eggs with great income, beekeeping and rabbit raising enrich the villages, timber processing is used for construction, and wood fiber processing plants are built."
    So many "-izations" are not only to decorate the countryside more beautifully, but also to develop diversified operations. It is estimated that within five years, timber can supply the needs of the county's construction, fruit trees can produce more than 20 million jin of fruit, and there should be everything from pepper, walnuts, to honey. Beautiful mountains and rivers, prosperous people and livestock, and abundant grain will be the most appropriate portrayal.

    向园林化迈进的临漳县
    王嘉华
    临漳县在河北省的南端，一条漳河横贯全境。像许多受过害河蹂躏的地方一样，临漳县有着多年悲惨的经历。全县八十万亩耕地，有一半是沙质犯风地，还有八万亩沙荒。河水经常溃堤泛滥，水、旱、风、沙灾害频繁，群众一直过着困苦的生活。解放后，这个县本着靠河治河、有沙治沙、向土地争粮、叫沙荒还债的精神，大力造林育林。从1949年到1957年，造林五万九千多亩，在村旁、宅旁、路旁、河旁植树七百九十多万株。造林之后，八万亩沙荒已经开始固定下来，二十多万亩沙地上出现了一片片良田。全县粮食亩产量由过去的一百多斤提高到三百斤，这个缺粮县变成了余粮县。在今年春季，这个县又掀起了千军万马的造林高潮。全县人民苦战十五天，造林二万多亩，完成四旁植树三千三百万株，实现了绿化的第一步。
    经过春季造林，在全县的乡间大道旁，在近千里的主支灌溉渠道旁，已经是树木成行；万古千年的老漳河的两岸都栽起了护岸林；昔日留下来的荒凉的沙滩，也都披上了绿色的新装。临漳县有个四面环沙的段汪村，现在完全变了样：新开辟的大道旁柳树成行，树后边是一行葡萄苗，再后边是一条狭长的花池，围绕着村庄的是五条林带成片的苹果、杏、梨、桑和葡萄园，浓绿的洋槐林陪衬着长着茂盛庄稼的农田和水多草旺的牧场，风光分外绮丽。
    实现了绿化第一步的临漳县没有就此止步。县委进一步分析了本县植树造林情况，发现潜力仍然很大，提出在现有每户平均一千二百五十株树的基础上，经过今冬明春大战，每人平均有万株树。具体做法是扩大宜林面积，扫残，补缺，树木品种更新，把一切可能绿化的地方都要彻底绿化，实现美化、香化。
    8月底，全县实现了人民公社化。全县的人们决心争取早日实现农村园林化，并且提出以下具体要求：
    沙荒绿洲化。今冬明春压缩漳河河道，造林十万亩，使林木交错排列；在险工的地方，全部造成雁翼林；已基本绿化的沙荒都按照每亩四百到六百株的要求进行补栽，达到“漳河两岸好风光，农村城市没两样，林洲林海一片绿，林带林网树成墙，走遍全县树连树，望断田野树茫茫”。
    渠道林网化、桑园化。全县有同和、民有、太平三条大干渠，共长六百里，要在渠道两旁栽树三、五行，共植树一千六百多万株，其中有桑树六百万株。结合植桑大力发展养蚕，做到“远看渠道是绿林，近看林网树成荫，河渠滚滚流碧水，沙滩刮风不起尘，走进渠旁去采桑，家家户户养蚕忙，蚕丝织成绫罗缎，人人都穿好衣裳”。
    公路林墙化、正规化。交通要道都修成十公尺宽的公路，乡与乡和田间机耕路修成简易公路，路旁栽三、五行树，共植四百万株，实现“公路成网，树木成墙，冬夏长青，鸟语花香”。
    村庄森林化，农村城市化，环乡林沟化，村庄绿化、美化、香化、洁化、公园化。乡乡都有环乡林和环乡沟，岸上栽垂杨柳、果树，沟内种荷花养鱼。乡内修成整齐划一宽广平坦的马路，路旁栽上树木。主要街道都有花池，池旁有葡萄架、藤萝架。为了达到农村公园化，各乡俱乐部门前都修建三、五个园亭。劳动人民生产归来，可以在园亭里休息，歌唱，听收音机广播，阅读书报，下棋。正是：“榆树点头迎人来，洋槐芬芳白花开，杨叶拍着巴掌笑，椿树挂着黄金牌，松柏长青人不老，桃梨杏柿永不败”。
    乡乡蜂场鱼塘化。养蜂养鱼，不但增加副业生产，提高人民生活，而且能消灭蚊蝇，改善环境卫生。这正构成：“槐杨密生柳絮长，四季鸟语花又香，五林围村常年青，池塘游鱼闪银光，秋来鲜果挂满树，小麦豆谷堆满仓，旧去新来喜气高，社会主义好风光”图景。
    全县林场化，场场工业化。要求做到“全县林场似海洋，大树底下喂猪、羊，鸡鸭下蛋收入大，养蜂养兔富家乡，木材加工搞建设，木造纤维加工厂”。
    这么多的“化”，不单是为了把农村点缀得更加美丽，而且是为了发展多种经营。估计五年内木材就可以供应本县建设的需要，果树可以产水果二千多万斤，花椒、核桃、蜂蜜，应有尽有。山川秀丽，人畜兴旺，五谷丰登，将是最适当的写照了。
