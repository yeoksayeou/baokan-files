    As long as the people unite and persist in struggle, colonialism is bound to fail.
    Liao Chengzhi sends a telegram to congratulate the establishment of the Provisional Government of Algeria.
    (Reported by this newspaper) Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, sent a telegram to Ferhat Abbas, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, on September 23, congratulating him on the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. The full text is as follows:
    Your Excellency Prime Minister:
    The Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity wholeheartedly congratulates the birth of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria and warmly celebrates the great victory of the Algerian people in their struggle for national independence.
    The establishment of the Republic of Algeria is the inevitable result of the long and arduous struggle of the heroic Algerian people, and another historically significant victory of the surging national independence movement in the vast Asian-African region. This major victory of the Algerian people has set a brilliant example for the African people who demand to get rid of colonial shackles and strive for national independence. At the same time, this once again proves that no matter how brutally and barbarously the colonialists suppress, as long as the people unite and persevere in their struggle unyieldingly, the colonialists are bound to suffer a shameful defeat.
    The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and fully supported the just cause of the Algerian people in their struggle for national independence. The decision of our government on September 22 to recognize the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria once again embodies the six hundred million Chinese people's sincere friendship and support for the Algerian people. We believe the Algerian people, under the leadership of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, will certainly be able to continue to crush the French colonialists' military suppression and political conspiracies, and achieve greater and complete victory. The Chinese people are willing to join hands closely with the Algerian people to strive for the further development of the friendship between the people of China and Algeria, and to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with the people of Asia and Africa and all peace-loving people in the world, and to work together to completely eliminate the scourge of colonialism and defend world peace.

    廖承志电贺阿尔及利亚临时政府成立
    本报讯　中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志9月23日致电阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府费尔哈特·阿巴斯总理祝贺阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立。全文如下：总理阁下：
    中国亚非团结委员会衷心祝贺阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的诞生，热烈欢呼阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立斗争的伟大胜利。
    阿尔及利亚共和国的成立，是英勇的阿尔及利亚人民进行长期坚苦斗争的必然结果，是广大亚非地区澎湃汹涌的民族独立运动又一次具有历史意义的胜利。阿尔及利亚人民的这一重大胜利，为要求摆脱殖民枷锁和争取民族独立的非洲人民树立了一个光辉的榜样。同时这也再一次证明，不管殖民主义者如何残暴和野蛮地镇压，只要人民团结一致、不屈不挠地坚持斗争，殖民主义者必定要遭到可耻的失败。
    中国人民一贯深切同情和完全支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的正义事业。我国政府于9月22日宣布承认阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的决定，再一次体现了六亿中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民的真诚友谊和支持。我们相信，阿尔及利亚人民在阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的领导下，一定能够继续粉碎法国殖民主义者的军事镇压和政治阴谋，而取得更伟大的、完全的胜利。中国人民愿与阿尔及利亚人民紧密地携起手来，为进一步发展中阿两国人民的友谊而努力，并与亚非人民和世界一切爱好和平的人民加强团结合作，为彻底消除殖民主义祸害和保卫世界和平而共同奋斗。
