　　We Love Peace But Absolutely Fear No War
　　The First Ministry of Machine Building Industry's Fourth Design Institute Establishes Militia Battalion
    We, the entire staff of the Fourth Design Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, resolutely support Premier Zhou's solemn statement and protest the arrogant provocations of American imperialism! After the shameful failure of its military aggression in the Middle East, American imperialism is plotting war conspiracies everywhere and now carries out military provocations and war threats against our great People's Republic of China. We solemnly warn the American aggressors that if they do not quickly withdraw their sinister claws, the Chinese people will smash the aggressors' bloody claws to pieces!
    All our staff have taken action, announcing the establishment of a militia battalion, with the president of the institute serving as the battalion commander and the Party committee secretary serving as the political commissar. All the youth of the institute have actively volunteered to join the people's armed forces. We will receive various military training to train ourselves into a militia force with military knowledge and combat readiness, ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. We can serve as combat teams or engineering teams; wherever the motherland needs us, we will go there. We will fully participate in the struggle to liberate Taiwan and all coastal islands! We must liberate Jinmen and Mazu! We must liberate Taiwan!
    The Entire Staff of the Fourth Design Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry
    Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, Jinmen, and Mazu are territories of our country, and our people have the right to liberate them at any time. No U.S. imperialism is allowed to interfere. The staff of our hospital oppose with utmost anger the military provocations and military threats of U.S. imperialism, resolutely support Premier Zhou's statement, and are determined to liberate Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, Jinmen, and Mazu. U.S. imperialism must get out of all Chinese territory. We want peace, but we are absolutely not afraid of war. If U.S. imperialism dares to ignite the flames of war, we will definitely give it a head-on blow. The more than one thousand employees of our hospital are determined to do a good job in the hospital and are constantly watching the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism, awaiting the orders of the motherland to take up arms, leave the hospital, and go to the forefront of liberating Taiwan, to drive the American troops out of Taiwan.
    The Entire Staff of Beijing Anding Hospital
    We resolutely support Premier Zhou's solemn statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region. We hate the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism. The great People's Republic of China exercises its own sovereignty and liberates its own territory, which no imperialism is allowed to interfere with! Taiwan is China's sacred territory, and we must liberate Taiwan. Our angry shouts pierced the night, and we all marched in the rain. We have also made full preparations to accept the call of the motherland. If necessary, we ask to be among the first to go to the battlefield. We are determined to turn anger into strength to accelerate the progress of our great motherland. If U.S. imperialism does not come to its senses and dares to impose war on us, let our 600 million people unite to pronounce its death sentence!
　　The Entire Membership of the 101 Middle School Trade Union
    We firmly support Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region. Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, Jinmen, and Mazu have been our country's territory since ancient times, and U.S. imperialism is absolutely not allowed to occupy them. We express our utmost anger at Dulles's war-mongering and fact-twisting clamor, and we must liberate Taiwan.
    We solemnly swear to the Party and the motherland: we are always ready to respond to all calls of the motherland, put down our pens, take up arms, and wipe out the American aggressors in the Taiwan Strait!
　　Zhao Zhemian, Ding Bogao, and 21 Others, of the Fourth Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry
    Disregarding the opposition of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism dares to carry out provocative activities in the Taiwan Strait region. Taiwan is our country's territory and an inseparable part of our motherland. Liberating Taiwan is our country's internal affair, and we absolutely will not allow U.S. imperialism to occupy our territory of Taiwan. We fully support Premier Zhou's statement.
    Students! As we live a happy life, let us not forget that our compatriots in Taiwan are living a life worse than animals under the iron hooves of imperialism. In order to liberate our country's territory of Taiwan, all students in our department unanimously expressed that we must listen to the Party. When the motherland needs us, we will immediately put down our pens, pick up our guns, and go to the forefront of the motherland.
          The Entire Student Body of the Construction Department, Beijing Mining Institute
