    60,000 kVA Transformer Can Prevent Lightning and Cool Automatically

    The Shenyang Transformer Factory manufactured the first domestically produced 60,000 kVA, 110,000-voltage giant transformer on the 7th. This is another great leap forward in China's motor manufacturing industry.

    This 60,000 kVA three-phase three-winding air-cooled lightning-proof power transformer was manufactured for the Beijing Thermal Power Plant. It weighs 141 tons and has a huge power transformation capacity, enough to supply lighting for five cities with a population of three million. One such transformer is sufficient for twenty spinning mills with 50,000 spindles each. Due to its high voltage, its power transmission capacity is also very strong. It can transmit electricity directly over 180 kilometers without intermediate substations. Its greatest features are its ability to prevent lightning, automatic cooling, and its ability to transform into two different voltages for ease of use.

    六万千伏安变压器能防雷能自动冷却
    沈阳变压器厂在7日制成了国产第一台六万千伏安、十一万电压的巨型变压器。这是我国电机制造工业的又一大跃进。
    这台六万千伏安三相三线圈风冷防雷电力变压器，是为北京热电厂制造的。它的体重一百四十一吨，变电能力巨大，可供给五个三百万人口的城市照明使用。二十个五万锭子的纱厂有这样一台变压器就足够了。由于电压高，输电能力也很强，它可以不经过中途变电，就直接输送一百八十公里以上。它的最大特点是能够防雷，又能自动冷却，还可以变出两种不同的电压，便于应用。
