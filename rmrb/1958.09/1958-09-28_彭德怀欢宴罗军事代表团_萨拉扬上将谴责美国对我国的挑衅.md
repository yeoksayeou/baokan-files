Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: Upon arriving at Beijing Airport this afternoon, Romanian People's Republic Armed Forces Minister General Sălăjan stated that the Romanian people stand with the Chinese people, along with the other peoples of the socialist family headed by the powerful Soviet Union, and support the Chinese people's struggle to defend their country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The US imperialists' aggressive activities in the ancient Chinese territory of Taiwan, and their provocative threats against the Chinese people, cannot frighten the 600 million people of great China. The Chinese people have the right to take all measures to defend their country and completely liberate the territory of the Republic.

He said that the people and governments of China and Romania have always held completely consistent views on major international issues. The fraternal and close friendship between China and Romania is developing and consolidating day by day. Today, the visit of the Romanian military delegation headed by General Sălăjan to our country will further promote the fraternal unity and friendship between the people and armies of China and Romania, and will further strengthen the unity and cooperation of the socialist camp, thereby making a beneficial contribution to the cause of safeguarding world peace.

In his speech, General Sălăjan said that our two peoples share the same aspirations and interests, resolutely advance along the road of building socialism, and are achieving new and greater successes day by day in the common struggle of socialist construction and defending peace. The people's armies of our two countries vigilantly protect the revolutionary achievements obtained by Romania and China. The fraternal friendship between the peoples and armies of our two countries, and the friendship and unity between the peoples and armies of socialist countries, give our countries and the entire socialist camp an invincible force.

Among those present at the airport to welcome the distinguished guests today were Senior General Huang Kecheng, General Zhang Zongxun, General Peng Shaohui, Vice Admiral Luo Shunchu, Lieutenant General Cao Lihuai, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Tan Xilin, and officers from the Beijing garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Army, Navy, and Air Force.

Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai hosted a banquet tonight to welcome all members of the Romanian military delegation to China, headed by General Sălăjan.

Marshal Nie Rongzhen and senior generals of the People's Liberation Army, Senior General Huang Kecheng, General Zhang Zongxun, Air Force General Liu Yalou, General Peng Shaohui, General Li Juikui, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Vice Admiral Luo Shunchu, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, among others, attended the banquet as guests.

At the beginning of the banquet, Marshal Peng Dehuai said: Tonight, we feel boundless joy to have the opportunity to gather with our close comrades. The glorious Romanian People's Army is a modernized, combined arms, and excellent people's army that has become a powerful force for defending the motherland and safeguarding peace in Europe and the world.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army feel boundless admiration and express heartfelt gratitude to the Romanian people for the great achievements they have made in accelerating socialist construction, for their significant contributions in accelerating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and defending the principles of proletarian internationalism, and for their tremendous efforts in supporting our people's socialist construction, opposing imperialist aggression, and maintaining world peace.

Marshal Peng Dehuai stated that the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will always unite closely with the fraternal armies of socialist countries to work for the security of the socialist camp and world peace.

General Sălăjan said in his speech: Our Romanian and Chinese peoples will always be united. Our two peoples are engaged in peaceful labor. Our common aspirations and efforts are aimed at making our countries prosperous, our lives happy, and promoting world peace and friendship among all peoples. However, it would be a great mistake to regard the desire for peace of our two peoples as a sign of fear and weakness. We are fully prepared to vigilantly defend the position of the socialist camp and will regard an attack on any socialist country as an attack on the entire socialist camp, and give the imperialist aggressor groups the response they deserve for their war provocations.

General Sălăjan sternly condemned the US imperialists' hostility and aggression against the Chinese people, and firmly supported the Chinese people's sacred struggle to liberate their motherland's territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands. He said that the entire Romanian people unanimously express their strong anger at US imperialism and demand that the US aggressor troops immediately withdraw from all the islands belonging to China and retract their clutches. The heroic Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the support of the peace-loving people of the world, will surely win the victory in their struggle.

The participants at the banquet welcomed the speeches of Marshal Peng Dehuai and General Sălăjan with warm applause, and continuously toasted to the unbreakable fraternal friendship and unity between the peoples and armies of China and Romania, and to the friendship between all peoples who oppose aggression and safeguard peace!

Also invited to the banquet tonight were Romanian Ambassador to China, Ludenco, and Military Attaché Lieutenant Colonel Nicu, as well as military attachés from various countries to China.

After the banquet, the Ministry of National Defense held a welcoming party for the distinguished guests.
