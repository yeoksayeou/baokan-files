    Go All Out, Aim High, and Achieve Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results in the Technical Revolution
    Guarantee the Overfulfillment of the September Leap Forward Plan
    We firmly support Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait, and we resolutely protest against U.S. imperialism's occupation of our Taiwan and its threat to world peace.
    We will use practical actions to build our socialism, and we are always ready to stand firmly on the forefront of defending our motherland when the motherland needs us.
    All our members of the Communist Youth League and young people guarantee to go all out, aim high, actively complete and overfulfill the factory's September Leap Forward plan, ensure that technical personnel go deep into the workshops and combine with workers, and solve general technical problems overnight. In the technical revolution, we will use our practical actions to protest against the threat and provocation of U.S. imperialism against our country.
               All members of the Communist Youth League and young people of the Technical Branch of Beijing Instrument Factory
