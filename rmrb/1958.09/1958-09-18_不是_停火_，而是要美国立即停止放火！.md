	Not "Ceasefire," But an Immediate End to the Arson by the United States!
	People all over the world are paying close attention to the resumed Sino-American talks in Warsaw, hoping that this meeting can find a genuine solution to the current dangerous war situation in the Taiwan Strait. However, just as Eisenhower solemnly announced, "We believe that a way out can and should be found through diplomatic means," we see the United States continuing to strengthen and expand its aggressive military deployments in the Taiwan Strait.
	According to a statement on the 17th by the US military command in Taiwan, the US aircraft carrier "Essex," which was transferred from the Mediterranean to the Taiwan Strait, has joined the Seventh Fleet. The Seventh Fleet now has six aircraft carriers. United Press International boasted that this has allowed the United States to assemble the largest naval nuclear strike force ever assembled in the world. According to previous reports, in addition to the aircraft carriers, the Seventh Fleet has also concentrated three heavy cruisers and forty destroyers in the Taiwan Strait. The United States Air Force has transferred at least two to three hundred jets to Taiwan. In recent days, the 11th Air Force Group was transferred from the United States. It is equipped with a batch of F104 fighter jets and another batch of troops equipped with the latest nuclear weapons. Six weeks ago, even before the People's Liberation Army launched punitive strikes against the Jinmen (Quemoy) Chiang troops, the United States had already deployed Matador missiles in Taiwan and kept them in a state of readiness for launch day and night. Now, the US military in Taiwan has announced that the 2nd Missile Battalion of the 71st Artillery Regiment, consisting of seven or eight hundred personnel and forty-eight missile launchers, was transferred from the United States on the 16th. In addition to the thousands of Marines already landed in Taiwan, another five thousand ground troops will be transferred. And the US military aid advisory group in Taiwan has also been expanded to four thousand five hundred people.
	What is the purpose of the United States intensifying its aggressive deployment in the Taiwan Strait? Is this military deployment, as Eisenhower said, for the purpose of "resolving differences without the use of force"? Isn't it precisely what Eisenhower has vehemently opposed: "using naked force to achieve the purpose of aggression"? The Sino-American talks have resumed; however, the situation in the Taiwan Strait has become even more serious due to the US strengthening and expanding its aggressive military deployment!
	While the United States is intensifying its aggressive deployment, on the 15th, the "New York Herald Tribune," the "San Francisco Examiner," and the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" all issued a Washington-sourced message from London, saying that the United States is actually attempting to demand that China "ceasefire" and "stop military operations near the coastal islands." Moreover, the US side believes that this is a prerequisite for resolving the situation in the Taiwan Strait. In his speech on September 11, Eisenhower said, "We believe that it is urgently necessary to make arrangements so that the gunfire ceases and paves the way for a peaceful settlement." From these recent facts, it appears that the United States is continuing to play the same tricks it played in past Sino-American talks, vainly attempting to confuse the international dispute between China and the United States with the internal affairs of the Chinese people liberating Taiwan from the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, in order to induce China to recognize that the United States will forever occupy China's territory of Taiwan.
	There is no war between China and the United States, so where does the talk of "ceasefire" come from? The Chinese people's struggle to liberate all of their territory has been going on for eleven or twelve years. Since the liberation of the mainland, the struggle against the remnant forces of the Chiang Kai-shek clique entrenched in Taiwan and the coastal islands has also been going on for nine years. At present, our people's military actions against the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched in Jinmen are simply a continuation of this struggle and have no direct relationship to international tensions. The root cause of the current resurgence of tensions in the Taiwan Strait is the continuation and development of the tense situation caused by the United States' armed occupation of China's territory Taiwan nine years ago. The United States is deploying troops and stationing them in the Taiwan Strait, using military threats and war provocations to interfere in our liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands, making the dispute between China and the United States one with an imminent danger of war. And this danger is by no means due to what the United States calls "unprovoked attacks" by China.
	Everyone knows that since Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of the United States, launched a full-scale civil war against the liberated areas in 1946, the Chinese people have begun a people's liberation war aimed at eliminating the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people achieved victory in the great People's Liberation War and liberated the entire mainland. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands from the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is merely a continuation of this great People's Liberation War. When the Chinese people were conducting the Liaoshen Campaign, the Pingjin Campaign, the Huaihai Campaign, the campaign to cross the Yangtze River and liberate Nanjing and Shanghai, and even the campaign to cross the sea and liberate Hainan Island, the largest island in the South China Sea, in order to annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek clique's army, these battles were on a much larger scale than the military operations our army is currently taking against Jinmen and other coastal islands. Why was there never any international tension at those times? The matter is clearly laid out: liberating all of China from the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique is a matter for the Chinese people themselves, and it will not cause any threat to "peace," nor will it involve any foreign country, and no foreign country has the right to interfere. Therefore, the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory from reactionary rule can never become the source of international tension, just as the American Civil War, Indonesia's war to eliminate rebel groups, and even the recent overthrow of the Faisal dynasty by the Iraqi people, will not cause international disputes.
	After completing the liberation of the mainland, the Chinese people continued their struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands. As early as September 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the remnants of the Chiang army entrenched in Jinmen. Later, in 1955, the People's Liberation Army liberated Yijiangshan, Dachen, and other Taizhou Islands. Since then, the fighting against Jinmen and Matsu has continued uninterrupted, and the artillery battles have been going on intermittently, but they have never created any international tension. Of course, it should be pointed out that the current situation in Jinmen and Matsu is slightly different from three years ago, that is, the Chiang troops entrenched there are now much larger than three years ago, accounting for one-third of the total strength of the Chiang army. The continuous increase in Chiang troops in the past few years is due to the Chiang Kai-shek clique's attempt, with the support of the United States, to use Jinmen and Matsu as a springboard for attacking the Chinese mainland. Therefore, the Chiang troops entrenched in Jinmen and Matsu have been harassing and probing the mainland for the past few years, especially since the Middle East crisis, while the Chiang Kai-shek clique has been clamoring about "counterattacking the mainland," it has intensified its harassment of the mainland based on Jinmen and Matsu. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army has to give a heavy blow to the Chiang troops entrenched in the coastal islands. This, like the situation in the past eight or nine years, is an internal matter of China. The reason why international war clouds have appeared in the Taiwan Strait today is not due to the Chinese people's continued People's Liberation War to complete their unfinished task and severely punish the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Jinmen and Matsu who are stubbornly incorrigible and harass our mainland, but comes from another source. That is, nine years ago, the United States armed and occupied China's Taiwan, preventing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and causing a serious dispute between China and the United States. The United States' unwarranted aggression has made the Taiwan Strait a "hotbed" of war. The Chinese people, in order to ease the tension in the Taiwan Strait, have made tremendous efforts based on the principle of resolving international disputes through peaceful means. As early as the Bandung Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai of our government proposed sitting down and negotiating with the United States. In the subsequent Sino-American talks, our representatives repeatedly put forward concrete proposals for a peaceful settlement of this dispute. It is only because the United States vainly attempted to confuse the international dispute between China and the United States with the internal affairs of the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, unreasonably demanding that China recognize the United States' right to "individual and collective self-defense" over China's territory Taiwan, and also demanding that China recognize its abandonment of the right to liberate its own territory Taiwan by force, that the dispute between China and the United States over the Taiwan issue has not been resolved to this day. At present, the so-called "ceasefire" proposal put forward by the United States is nothing more than a new trick of an old conspiracy. The US authorities know that our army on the Xiamen-Jinmen front has used powerful artillery fire to blockade the coast of Jinmen, and the Chiang army entrenched there is in great danger of running out of ammunition and food. Therefore, the Americans are trying to obtain a so-called "ceasefire" as a delaying tactic to allow the Jinmen Chiang army to receive reinforcements and respite, and to prevent our people from liberating the coastal islands. The gentlemen in Washington are also trying to use the "ceasefire" trap to induce China to acquiesce in the United States' occupation of our territory Taiwan and its aggressive activities of running rampant in the Taiwan Strait. The decision-makers in the United States should be warned: what the United States failed to obtain in past Sino-American talks will not be obtained today by relying on the United States' gunboat policy and atomic blackmail. The Chinese people will never and absolutely not give up their right to liberate their own territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands! As for when and in what way to liberate them, that is entirely a matter for the Chinese people themselves. A military approach can be adopted, or a peaceful approach can be adopted. There are also many precedents for these different approaches in the Chinese People's Liberation War. For example, in the Pingjin Campaign, Tianjin was liberated after the annihilation of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's army, while Beiping at that time was peacefully liberated. The Chinese people know how to handle their own affairs according to different circumstances. And as long as there is no armed interference from the United States, the peaceful liberation of Taiwan is entirely possible.
	The Sino-American talks have resumed. In the urgent situation where the situation in the Taiwan Strait could break out into a war between China and the United States at any time, time is of the essence. Chairman Mao said at the Supreme State Conference: "If both sides have the sincerity to solve the problem, the negotiations may achieve some results." If the United States is really as Eisenhower swears, "sincerely hopes" for peace, then the urgent task is to first stop the continued intensification of war deployments in the Taiwan Strait, and stop the continued military threats and war provocations against our country, so that the war situation in the Taiwan Strait can be eased immediately. As long as the United States abandons the use of force and the threat of force, there will be no tension in the Taiwan Strait at all. Therefore, the problem is not to demand a "ceasefire," but to immediately stop the arson of the United States before the war is triggered.

### 不是“停火”，而是要美国立即停止放火！

    不是“停火”，而是要美国立即停止放火！
    全世界人民关注着在华沙恢复的中美会谈，希望在这次会谈能够为台湾海峡地区目前出现的战争危险局势找到一个真正解决的道路。然而，就在艾森豪威尔慎重其事地宣布了：“我们认为，以外交手段，能够而且应当找到一条出路”的同时，却看到了美国继续在台湾海峡地区加强扩大侵略的军事部署。
    据侵台美军司令部17日宣布，从地中海调到台湾海峡的美国航空母舰
  “爱塞克斯”号已经参加了第七舰队。第七舰队现有六艘航空母舰。合众国际社吹嘘说，这样就使美国集结了世界上所曾经集结过的最大的海军原子核攻击力量。据以前的消息，第七舰队集中在台湾海峡的，除了航空母舰以外，还有三艘重巡洋舰、四十艘驱逐舰。美国空军已至少有二百架到三百架喷气机调到台湾。最近几天，又从美国调到第十一空军大队。配有一批F104式战斗喷气机，以及另一批配有最新式核武器的部队。在六个星期以前，即早在人民解放军对金门蒋军进行惩罚性的打击之前，美国已在台湾设置的斗牛士式导弹，并且日夜处于准备发射的状态中。现在侵台美军又宣布在16日从美国调到属于第七十一炮兵团在第二导弹营，有七八百人，四十八个导弹发射器。除了已经在台湾登陆的海军陆战队几千人以外，又将调到地面部队五千名。而侵台美国军事援助顾问团也已经扩大到四千五百人。
    美国在台湾海峡地区加紧侵略部署，是为的什么？难道这种军事部署，是像艾森豪威尔所说的为的是“不使用武力解决分歧”吗？难道不正是艾森豪威尔所口口声声反对的：“利用赤裸裸的武力来达到侵略的目的”吗？中美会谈恢复了；台湾海峡地区的局势由于美国加强了扩大侵略的军事部署，却更加严重了！
    在美国加紧扩大侵略部署的同时，15日这一天，美国“纽约先驱论坛报”、“旧金山考察者报”以及日本“读卖新闻”从伦敦发出的一条华盛顿透露出来的消息，都说美国竟企图要求我国“停火”、“停止在沿海岛屿附近的军事行动”。而且说，美国方面认为这是解决台湾海峡地区的前提。艾森豪威尔在9月11日演说中曾说过，“我们认为迫切需要作出安排，以便炮火停止，并且为和平解决铺平道路”。从最近的这些事实看来，原来美国是继续玩弄它在过去中美会谈中的手段，妄想把中美两国的国际争端，同中国人民从蒋介石集团反动统治下解放台湾的内政问题混淆起来，来诱使我国承认美国永远侵占我国的领土台湾。
    中国和美国之间，并没有发生战争，何来“停火”之可言？中国人民为解放全部领土的斗争，进行了已经十一、二年了。自大陆解放后，对蒋介石集团残余部队盘踞的台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争，也进行了九年了。目前我国人民对盘踞金门蒋介石军队的军事行动，完全是这个斗争的继续，根本谈不上和国际紧张局势有什么直接关系。目前台湾海峡地区的紧张局势之所以重现，其根源是美国九年以前武力侵占了我国的领土台湾所造成的紧张局势的继续和发展。美国调兵遣将，陈兵台湾海峡，用军事威胁和战争挑衅来干涉我解放台湾和沿海岛屿，使得中美之间的争端，发生了有一触即发的战争危险。而这个危险，绝不是像美国所说的，由于我国的什么“无端挑起的进攻”。
    谁都知道，从1946年蒋介石在美国支持下发动了进犯解放区的全面内战以后，中国人民就开始了以消灭蒋介石集团的反动统治为目的的人民解放战争。中国人民在中国共产党的领导之下，在伟大的人民解放战争中，取得了胜利，解放了全部大陆。中国人民决心要把台湾和沿海岛屿从蒋介石集团的反动统治之下解放出来，不过是这一伟大的人民解放战争的继续。当中国人民为歼灭蒋介石集团的军队，进行了东北的辽沈战役、平津战役、淮海战役、大举横渡长江的进兵江南解放南京、上海的战役，以至渡海解放南中国海的最大岛屿海南岛的时候，这些战役比起我军现在对金门等沿海岛屿所采取的军事行动来，规模要大得多。为什么在那些时候，从来没有发生过什么国际紧张局势呢？事情是明明白白摆着的，从蒋介石集团反动统治之下，解放全中国，是中国人民自己的事情，根本不会引起什么对“和平”的威胁，根本不会牵连到任何外国，而任何外国也无权来横加干涉。因之，中国人民从反动统治之下解放自己的领土，永远不可能成为国际紧张局势的根源，也正像美国的南北战争、印度尼西亚消灭叛乱集团的战争，以至最近伊拉克人民推翻费萨尔王朝一样，不会引起国际的争端。
    中国人民在完成大陆解放之后，就继续进行解放台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争。远在1949年9月，中国人民解放军曾经对盘据金门蒋军残余发动攻击。其后在1955年，人民解放军就解放了一江山、大陈等台州列岛。从那时以来，对金门、马祖的战斗一直继续不断，炮战时紧时稀地一直在进行，但一直没有形成什么国际紧张局势。当然，应当指出，目前金门、马祖的情况和三年前稍有不同，那就是现在盘据在那里的蒋军比三年前大大增加了，共占蒋军全部兵力的三分之一。过去几年中蒋军的不断增加，是由于蒋介石集团在美国的支持下企图以金门、马祖作为进攻中国大陆的跳板。因此，盘据金门马祖的蒋军在过去几年中一直对大陆进行骚扰和试探，特别是在中东危机以来，蒋介石集团在大喊大叫“反攻大陆”的同时，加紧了以金门、马祖为基地的对大陆的骚扰。因之人民解放军不能不予盘据沿海岛屿的蒋军以沉重的打击。这正如过去八九年的情况一样，这是中国内部的事情。今天台湾海峡所以出现了国际战争的乌云，不是由于中国人民继续未竟全功的人民解放战争，严惩怙恶不悛、骚扰我大陆的金门、马祖的蒋介石部队所采取的军事行动，而是别有由来。那就是九年以前，美国武装侵占了我国的台湾，阻挠中国人民解放台湾，引起了中美两国之间严重的争端。美国无端的侵略使得台湾海峡地区成了一个战争的“温床”。中国人民为了缓和台湾海峡地区的紧张局势，本着通过和平途径解决国际争端的主张，曾作了巨大的努力。我国政府周恩来总理早在万隆会议上提出了同美国坐下来谈判的主张。而在以后的中美会谈中，我方代表又一再提出了和平解决这个争端的具体建议。只是由于美国妄想把中美两国的国际争端同中国人民解放台湾的内政混淆起来，无理地要求我国承认美国对我国的领土台湾有“单独和集体自卫”的权利，而又要我国承认放弃武力解放自己的领土台湾的权利，才使得中美关于台湾问题的争端，迄今未能解决。目前，美国提出的所谓“停火”主张，不过是旧阴谋的新花样。美国当局知道，厦门、金门前线我军已用强大的炮火封锁了金门的海岸，盘据那里的蒋军大有弹尽粮绝的危险。因而美国人企图求得所谓“停火”，作为缓兵之计，使金门蒋军得到增援和喘息，并阻止我国人民解放沿海岛屿。华盛顿的先生们还企图用“停火”的圈套来诱使我国默认美国占领我国领土台湾和在台湾海峡上横行霸道的侵略活动。应当正告美国的决策者们：美国在过去中美会谈中所未能得到的东西，今天，依靠美国的炮舰政策、原子讹诈，同样也是得不到的。中国人民永远和绝对不会放弃自己解放自己领土台湾和沿海岛屿的权利！至于在什么时候，用什么方式解放，那完全是中国人民自己的事情。可以采取武力方式，也可以采取和平方式。这些不同的方式，在中国人民解放战争中，也是不乏先例的。比如平津战役中，天津是在歼灭了蒋介石集团的军队之后解放的，而当时的北平，就是和平解放的。中国人民懂得如何按照不同情况，处理自己的事情。而只要没有美国的武装干涉，和平解放台湾也完全是可能的。
    中美会谈已经恢复了。在台湾海峡局势随时有可能爆发成为中美之间的战争的紧急情况下，时间是刻不容缓的。毛主席在最高国务会议上说：“如果双方具有解决问题的诚意的话，谈判可能会取得某些成果。”美国如果真的像艾森豪威尔赌咒的那样“真诚希望”和平，那末，当务之急就是首先停止在台湾海峡地区继续加紧战争部署，停止继续向我国进行军事威胁和战争挑衅，那样，台湾海峡地区的战争局势马上可以得到缓和。只要美国放弃使用武力和武力威胁，台湾海峡地区根本就不会发生任何紧张局势。因之，问题不在于要求什么“停火”，而是要在战火还没有触发之前，立即停止美国的放火行为。
