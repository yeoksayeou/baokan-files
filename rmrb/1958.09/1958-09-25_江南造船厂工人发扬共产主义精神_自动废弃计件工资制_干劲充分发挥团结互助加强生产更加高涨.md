According to the "Liberation Daily," the broad masses of workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard, in the torrent of the Great Leap Forward of exerting full effort and striving for the top, have, with the communist spirit of awareness, abandoned the piece-rate wage system that hindered the leap forward in production, and a brand-new situation has emerged in production.

During the Great Leap Forward, after education through the rectification movement, the workers' class consciousness was significantly improved. Everyone realized that the piece-rate wage system was not adapted to the situation of the Great Leap Forward. They posted big-character posters demanding the abolition of the piece-rate wage system and the implementation of the time-rate wage system. Some workers believed that the implementation of the piece-rate wage system in 1955 played a certain role in improving labor productivity, but there were many problems. Some people picked and chose the easy jobs with loose quotas, and were unwilling to do the jobs with tight quotas. Due to the implementation of piece-rate wages, it sometimes affected the unity between workers, between piece-rate workers and time-rate workers, and between workers and cadres. Some workers said: Because it is a piece-rate system, a few people do not pay attention to labor discipline. They say with good reason: "Anyway, pay according to work, more work more pay, less work less money!" In actual work, it naturally becomes that there is little exchange of technical experience with each other, and it is even more out of the question to innovate technology that requires time for experimentation.

In August, the only two workshops with piece-rate workers, the forging workshop and the painting workshop, thoroughly exposed the bad influence of the piece-rate system on the leap forward in production in big-character posters, and asked the factory leadership to approve their implementation of the time-rate wage system. The forging worker Zhou Guiquan's group said: Our production enthusiasm is for the realization of communism, for the happiness of future generations, not driven by the piece-rate system. The painter Li Ziwen said: "Before the Great Leap Forward, I thought that the piece-rate system of more work more pay was reasonable, but in the Great Leap Forward, the workers in the shipbuilding workshop were rushing to build a 5,000-ton ocean-going vessel day and night, and then I felt that the piece-rate system was not right." He wrote in a big-character poster: People are making a Great Leap Forward for the early realization of socialism, but in the Great Leap Forward, I am putting money into my own pocket, what kind of Great Leap Forward is this? Only labor for the collective interest is the real Great Leap Forward. Many piece-rate workers expressed their determination in big-character posters to abolish piece-rate, and production should be even more overfulfilled.

Starting in September, the factory leadership accepted the workers' demands and abolished the piece-rate system in the two workshops that implemented it. Competition was widely launched between individuals, between groups, and between work sections. When the forging worker Zhou Jingyun's group was forging the main engine roller shaft of the medium plate machine for rolling steel equipment, everyone used their brains to increase the daily output from the original six to eight and a half at once. Painters Ding Alin and others were doing jobs such as applying foamed plastic paint on the "Sibirtsev" ship. If they couldn't finish it during the day, they automatically continued to work at night. Everyone's enthusiasm was even higher than during the piece-rate system, and as a result, they overfulfilled the quota by forty-two man-days. Workers in the large work section of the forging workshop, which originally implemented the piece-rate wage system, saw that the small work section (time-rate wage) did not have enough time to forge large forgings, and immediately took the initiative to pull them over to forge them instead, and the spirit of unity and mutual assistance was promoted. Many time-rate workers were also very moved when they saw that piece-rate workers consciously abolished the piece-rate system. Everyone helped each other and learned from each other. Originally, only fifteen people in the forging workshop knew how to operate the steam hammer, but now, in just over ten days, more than thirty people in the entire workshop have learned how to operate the steam hammer.

    江南造船厂工人发扬共产主义精神
    自动废弃计件工资制
    干劲充分发挥团结互助加强生产更加高涨
    据解放日报消息  江南造船厂的广大职工在鼓足干劲，力争上游，生产大跃进的激流中，以共产主义的自觉精神，废弃了阻碍生产跃进的计件工资制度，生产上又出现了一个崭新的局面。
    在生产大跃进中，工人们经过整风运动的教育，阶级觉悟有了显著提高，大家认识到计件工资制和大跃进的形势不相适应了。他们纷纷用大字报要求取消计件工资制，实行计时工资制。有的工人认为：1955年推行计件工资制时，对提高劳动生产率起了一定作用，但是问题很多，有些人在工作时拣精拣肥，拣定额松的做，定额紧的就不愿做。由于实行计件工资，有时也影响了工人与工人之间、计件工人与计时工人之间、工人与干部之间的团结。有的工人说：因为是计件制，少数人对劳动纪律也不放在眼里了，他们满有道理地说：“反正按劳付酬，多劳多得，少做少拿钱呗！”在实际工作中，也很自然地变成相互之间很少交流技术经验，革新技术需要花费时间进行试验的事，就更谈不上了。
    8月份，这个厂仅有的锻工和油漆两个车间的计件工人们在大字报上彻底地自我揭发了计件制对生产跃进的坏影响，要求工厂领导批准他们实行计时工资制。锻工周桂泉小组说：我们的生产积极性是为了实现共产主义，为了子孙万代的幸福，并不是计件制推动的。油漆工人李子文说：“跃进以前，我认为计件制多劳多得是合情合理的，大跃进了，造船车间的工人们以冲天的干劲没日没夜地赶制五千吨海轮，这时我觉得计件制不对头了。他在大字报上写道：人家大跃进为着社会主义早日实现，而我在大跃进里却把钞票装进自己口袋里，这还叫什么大跃进呢？只有为集体利益而劳动，才真正叫大跃进。很多计件工人在大字报上表示决心，取消计件，生产要更加超额。
    从9月份开始，这个厂的领导接受了工人的要求，在两个实行计件工资的车间取消了计件制。个人之间、小组之间、工段之间广泛展开了竞赛。锻工周景云小组锻造轧钢设备的中板机主机滚筒轴时，大家开动脑筋，使日产量由原来的六根一下子提高到八根半。油漆工人丁阿林等在“西比尔采夫”轮上做泡立水油漆等工作，白天做不完，晚上便自动连下去干。大家的热情比计件制的时候还要高，结果超额了四十二工。锻工车间原来实行计件工资的大工段工人，看到小工段（计时工资）锻打大型锻件来不及，立即主动拉过来代打，团结互助的精神得到了发扬。很多计时工人看到计件工人自觉取消计件制以后，也很受感动。大家互相帮助，互相学习。原来锻工车间只有十五个人会开汽锤，现在短短的十几天里，全车间就有三十多人学会了开汽锤。
