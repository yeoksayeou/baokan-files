Singing While Working and Studying
　　The school runs a factory, clang, clang! The school runs an iron factory, putting down pens to hold iron hammers, schoolbags turned into tool bags. Dormitory corridors are workshops, classrooms are workrooms; working from morning until the sun sets, never mind the sweat dripping down our faces! Studying and producing, now the school has greatly changed, everyone strives to be multi-talented, and the song of the Great Leap Forward echoes throughout the campus.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Beijing University　Wang Yonghou
　　Work-Study is Good
　　Work-study is really good, you learn a lot, in the past you memorized textbooks by rote, and didn’t know practical knowledge. Now we do it ourselves, theory is cleverly combined with practice, teaching is integrated with production, a win-win for both leap forward. “All occupations are inferior, only studying is superior,” that was the old way, today workers and peasants are intellectualized, and intellectuals must be reformed.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Northeast Institute of Technology　Wang Ruxin
　　Phoenix Flies from a Crow's Nest
　　The workshop is filled with hazy smoke, the foundry workers carry bags of molten iron, a shout of "Pouring!" Wonderful! Phoenix flies from a crow's nest! In the black sand, piles of red castings! Sand is to be molded, iron is to be melted, tractors, lathes, portable steam engines... lined up in rows, which one doesn't have castings? Which one isn't soaked with the sweat of foundry workers?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Tsinghua University　Meng Xianke

    歌唱半工半读
    学校办工厂叮叮当，叮叮当！学校办起铁工厂，放下笔杆握铁锤，书包变成工具囊。宿舍走廊是车间，教室当做工作房；从早干到太阳落，哪管汗珠满脸淌！又学习，又生产，如今学校大改变，个个争做多面手，跃进歌声遍校园。
  北京大学　王永厚
  勤工俭学好勤工俭学实在好，学得东西真不少，过去死背教科书，实际知识不知道。如今动手自己搞，理论实际配的巧，教学生产相结合，两全其美同飞跃。“万般皆下读书高”，那是过去老一套，今天工农知识化，知识分子要改造。东北工学院　王汝信乌鸦窝里凤凰飞车间里飞着迷蒙的烟灰，铸工们抬着一包包铁水，一声“浇注”！好哇！乌鸦窝里凤凰飞！黑色的砂土里，红色的铸件一堆堆！是砂要铸成型，是铁要化成水，拖拉机、车床、锅驼机……排成一队队，那一样没有铸件？那一样不浸着铸工的汗水？
