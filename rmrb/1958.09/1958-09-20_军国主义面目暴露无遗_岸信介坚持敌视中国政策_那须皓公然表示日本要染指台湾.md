    Militaristic features fully exposed
    Nobusuke Kishi persists in a policy of hostility towards China
    Hiroshi Nasu openly expresses Japan's intention to meddle in Taiwan
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 19th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, speaking on the issue of Japan-China relations in Chiba on the 18th, reiterated that he would "resolutely" not change his policy of hostility towards the Chinese people.
    Kishi told a group of Japanese reporters that he did not want to "immediately consider" the Socialist Party's request to his government on September 17th to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations, and that he would "resolutely take a wait-and-see attitude."
    When reporters asked him about Japan's attitude towards restoring China's seat in the United Nations, Kishi said that he "could not make a decision immediately."
    However, on the same day, Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, who was attending the United Nations General Assembly, publicly expressed his opposition to India's proposal to restore China's representation in the United Nations, and also advocated establishing a so-called "United Nations Peace Force" to resolve the situation in the Taiwan Strait, attempting to use the banner of the United Nations to cover up the US aggression against China. This exposes the essence of the Kishi Nobusuke government's consistent hostility towards the Chinese people, which was concealed by the so-called "wait-and-see attitude."
    Xinhua News Agency, September 19th: Japanese Ambassador to India Hiroshi Nasu revealed in Calcutta on the 18th that the latent Japanese imperialism, represented by Nobusuke Kishi, is still attempting to meddle in China's territory of Taiwan.
    Nasu Hiroshi, who once served as "economic advisor" to the Wang Jingwei puppet government and was only cleared of purges in 1951, openly said that "Taiwan was part of Japan before World War II, therefore, Japan should have a representative to attend any negotiations on the issue of the island." He also argued that "in seeking any solution to the Taiwan issue, the will of the Taiwanese people should be considered, and it is best to solve the Taiwan issue through a referendum."
    These remarks by this diplomat of the Kishi Nobusuke government clearly show that the latent Japanese imperialists, represented by Nobusuke Kishi, not only have no remorse for their past acts of aggression against China by force and their occupation of China's territory of Taiwan, but also continue to be hostile to the Chinese people, interfere in China's internal affairs, and even attempt to meddle in China's territory of Taiwan.

    军国主义面目暴露无遗
    岸信介坚持敌视中国政策
    那须皓公然表示日本要染指台湾
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介18日在千叶就日中关系问题发表谈话，再次表示他“坚决”不改变敌视中国人民的政策。
    岸信介对日本记者团说，社会党在9月17日向他的政府提出的关于打开日中关系僵局的要求，他不想“立刻考虑”，他将“坚决采取静观的态度”。
    当记者问他日本对恢复中国在联合国的席位问题所持的态度时，岸信介表示“不能立刻加以决定”。
    可是，就在同一天，正在出席联合国大会的日本外务相藤山爱一郎就公开表示反对印度提出的恢复中国在联合国的代表权的提案，并且还主张建立一支什么“联合国和平部队”来解决台湾海峡局势问题，企图用联合国的旗帜来掩护美国对中国的侵略。这就拆穿了岸信介用所谓“静观态度”来掩盖岸信介政府一贯敌视中国人民的本质。
    新华社19日讯　日本驻印度大使那须皓18日在加尔各答透露，以岸信介为代表的潜在的日本帝国主义仍然妄图染指中国的领土台湾。
    这个曾经担任过汪精卫傀儡政府“经济顾问”并且在1951年才被解除整肃的那须皓竟公然说，“在第二次世界大战以前台湾是日本的一部分，因此，日本应该有代表出席任何关于这个岛屿问题的谈判”。他还主张“在寻求台湾问题的任何解决办法的时候，都应该考虑台湾人的意志，最好是通过公民投票来解决台湾问题”。
    岸信介政府这位外交官的这番谈话清楚地表明：以岸信介为代表的潜在的日本帝国主义者直到今天为止，对他们过去以武力侵略中国以及强占中国领土台湾的侵略行为不但毫无悔过之心，而且还继续敌视中国人民、干涉中国内政甚至妄图染指中国领土台湾。
