    Writing After Editing

    Shedding the Fate of Being a Target
    The incident of American occupation soldiers using a streetcar full of passengers as a target and shooting dead a Japanese university student has aroused the anger of the Japanese people, who are demanding that the criminal American soldier be handed over to the Japanese court for trial. While the American soldier who killed people arbitrarily is undoubtedly guilty, can the occupiers who use the whole of Japan as a target escape responsibility? To fundamentally shed the fate of being a target, the American military occupation of Japan must end.
    Limited Sobriety
    U.S. Republican Senator Cooper said that U.S. aid to the Chiang Kai-shek group to "defend" Jinmen and Mazu has placed the U.S. in a "dangerous situation" and is not in the U.S. national interest. It seems that Cooper is more clear-headed than the Dulles gang.
    But Cooper also advocated that the United States should "do everything possible" to "defend" Taiwan. Wouldn't doing so put the United States in a "dangerous situation"? It is clear that Cooper's mind is still not very clear.
    Expanding the Target
    After Comrade Khrushchev pointed out to Eisenhower that in this era, warships can only be used as targets for rockets, the United States sent another heavy cruiser to the Taiwan Strait area.
    This move can only have one explanation: the heads of the Pentagon apparently believe that their targets are not large enough.

    摆脱作为靶子的命运
    美国占领者的士兵把满载乘客的电车作为靶子，枪杀了一个日本大学生的事件激起了日本人民的愤怒，纷纷要求把那个犯罪的美国兵交给日本法庭审理。任意杀人的美国兵固然罪无可逭，可是能够让把整个日本作为靶子的占领者逃脱罪责吗？要根本摆脱作为靶子的命运，就必须结束美国对日本军事的占领。
    有限的清醒
    美国共和党参议员库柏说美国帮助蒋介石集团“保卫”金门和马祖已使美国处于“危险的境地”，是不符合美国国家利益的。看来库柏倒是比杜勒斯之流头脑清醒一些。
    但是库柏又主张美国应当“尽一切力量”来“保卫”台湾。难道这样做就不会使美国处于“危险的境地”？可见库柏的头脑也还是不很清醒的。
    扩大靶子
    在赫鲁晓夫同志向艾森豪威尔指出，在今天这个时代，军舰只能作为火箭的打靶目标之后，美国又增派一艘重型巡洋舰到台湾海峡地区。
    这种举动只能有一个解释：五角大楼的头目显然认为他们的靶子还不够大。
