Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 15th: The surging anti-aggression patriotic fervor sweeping across the vast rural areas of the Fujian front lines is driving a new upsurge in agricultural production. While simultaneously taking up arms to defend the coast and making all preparations to support the front lines, over ten million farmers throughout the province are also wielding their hoes, toiling day and night in the fields, strengthening field management of grain crops. More than 800,000 cadres at the sixth level and above are going deep into the fields to strengthen specific leadership, ensuring an even greater harvest in the autumn.

Fujian Province's grain crops are generally growing well. Various localities are launching crash campaigns to apply additional fertilizer and eliminate lagging fields. Currently, about 70% of the province's 12 million mu of late rice have undergone weeding and fertilization twice, and about 30% have undergone weeding and fertilization three times. As of September 9th, the province had accumulated more than 37 billion dan of fertilizer for autumn use, averaging over 2,000 dan per mu. The slogans of farmers everywhere are: "Producing one more dan of grain is adding one more point of strength to strike the enemy," and "Produce more grain for the front lines; fiercely strike the American wolves." Farmers in Guanqiao Town, Nan'an County, near Jinmen, recently accumulated 250,000 dan of fertilizer in one evening to provide "tonics" to the poorly growing seedlings. In Jinjiang and Putian counties, where the struggle against the enemy along the coast is exceptionally tense, the broad masses of farmers are vigilantly watching the actions of the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits while intensifying their efforts to apply phosphate and potash fertilizers to late rice, dig drainage ditches, add soil and sand, and erect supports and ropes. They are determined not to allow the late rice to be flattened by typhoons. In remote mountainous areas, farmers are also intensifying their military training while vigorously eliminating lagging fields. Each agricultural cooperative in Jiangle County has established "decisive battle corps." Many decisive battle corps eat at 4:00 AM and set out at 4:30 AM, and continue working until late at night. They have increased the amount of weeding done per person per day from one mu to two and a half mu.

    多打粮食送前方　狠狠打击美国狼
    福建农业生产出现新高潮
    新华社福州15日电　在福建前线广大农村中掀起的汹涌澎湃的反侵略爱国怒潮，推动着农业生产出现新的高潮。全省一千多万农民在一手拿枪保卫海防和作好支援前线的一切准备工作的同时，一手拿锄，日夜苦战田间，加强粮食作物的田间管理，八十多万六级干部深入田头，加强具体领导，确保秋季更大丰收。
    福建省粮食作物一般生长良好。各地正在突击追肥和消灭落后田。目前全省一千二百万亩晚稻，已经中耕锄草和追肥二次的达70％左右，中耕锄草和追肥三次的有30％左右。到9月9日止，全省已积秋季用肥三百七十多亿担，平均每亩二千担以上。各地农民的口号是：“多增产一担粮，就多增加一分打击敌人的力量”、“多打粮食送前方，狠狠打击美国狼”。靠近金门的南安县官桥镇的农民、在最近的一个晚上积了二十五万担肥料，给生长不够好的禾苗增添了“补药”。在沿海对敌斗争异常紧张的晋江、蒲田等县，广大农民一面警惕地注视着美蒋匪盗的行径，一面加紧给晚稻追施磷钾肥料、挖排水沟、添土加沙、搭架拉绳，他们决不让晚稻因受台风影响而倒伏。在偏僻的山区里，农民们也在加紧练武的同时，大举消灭落后田。将乐县各个农业社都建立了决战团，许多决战团在清早四点吃饭，四点半出击，晚上还干到下半夜。他们每人每天除草由一亩增加到二亩半。
