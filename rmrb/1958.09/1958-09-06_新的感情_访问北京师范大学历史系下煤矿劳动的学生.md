New Feelings
　　——Visiting Beijing Normal University History Department Students Working in Coal Mines
　　By Our Correspondent Bai Sheng

　　It was late at night. The lights were out in all the dormitories. But in a spacious classroom at Beijing Normal University, the lights were still on, and several young people were intensely buried in writing.

　　Who is the master of history?

　　Just a few days ago, these history students had returned from working in the Mentougou coal mine. Still covered in coal dust from the mine, they had plunged into the intense work of compiling a "Brief History of the Mentougou Coal Mine."

　　What force was encouraging them? Before setting off from the school to the mine, the Party committee leaders had repeatedly instructed them to transform their thinking through labor, conduct investigations and research, improve teaching quality, and bring culture to the mine. However, they still had some doubts in their minds, especially about whether working in the mine with the workers could be combined with their history major to improve teaching quality and learn historical knowledge. They were very skeptical. However, the short period of labor in the mine completely shattered these erroneous ideas. Their thoughts and feelings changed, and they truly realized what history is and who is the master of history.

　　In the past, in the classroom, they had been misled by the genealogies of emperors and generals and the bourgeois historical scholarship that valued the past over the present, believing that only figures like Qin Shi Huang, Emperor Wu of Han, and Emperor Taizong of Tang were the true records of history. However, when they truly came into contact with the working people and lived with them, they realized that only the history of the working people is the richest epic, and the inspiring history of the working people is endless and inexhaustible.

　　In this quiet night, only the scratching of pens on paper could be heard in the classroom. As the students wrote, they were constantly moved by the history of the miners and unconsciously immersed in the unforgettable memories of their labor in the mine.

　　The First Lesson of Labor

　　The morning at the Mentougou Coal Mine.

　　The mine entrance was unusually lively, with a group of young people in black miner's uniforms and miner's hats appearing among the ranks of many veteran miners. Under the care and protection of the veteran miners, these young strangers stepped onto the lecture hall of mine labor for the first time. They were history students from Beijing Normal University who had come to the mine to participate in labor.

　　When the cage-like elevator took them to the underground mine more than 300 meters below the surface, they were so excited!

　　Everywhere in the mine was the sound of labor. After the experienced miners started the coal cutting machine with a roar, shiny lumps of coal rolled down the chute on the slope with a crash. The young miners, who were stepping onto the labor lecture hall for the first time, closely followed the experienced miners, holding electric drills to drill holes, helping the masters shovel coal into cans, and nervously pushing out can after can of coal weighing 600 kilograms. Although these young new miners sometimes felt that their limbs were very tired, they were encouraged by the selfless labor enthusiasm of the veteran miners, who were unwilling to delay even their meal times, and they were even more motivated to work.

　　Once, when female student Sun Yue'e was helping a veteran miner hold a drill to make holes, a gust of cool wind suddenly struck. The experienced veteran miner, disregarding his own safety, still held the electric drill in one hand and hurriedly pushed Sun Yue'e to the side with the other. Immediately afterwards, there was a loud cracking sound of coal falling, which startled Sun Yue'e. When she couldn't figure out what was going on, she looked more closely and saw that a large piece of coal had fallen from the roof in the place where she had been working. At that time, she immediately realized the veteran miner's infinite concern and love for her. She was so excited that she couldn't say anything, but the veteran miner kindly spoke first: "Don't be afraid, it's okay."

　　After getting out of the mine, this girl with two short braids felt very excited when she thought of the scene at that time. Although she had studied well in her class, she had been criticized by her classmates for having a strong sense of individualism and often cared about personal gains and losses in her studies and life. At that time, she didn't think much of it, always feeling that who wouldn't have individualistic thoughts! But this old worker's action gave her a profound education, making her realize that the working class has a selfless and noble quality at all times. Sun Yue'e was determined to thoroughly transform herself, overcome individualistic thoughts, and learn from the workers.

　　Xu Peng, this petite and enthusiastic girl, was assigned to work in miner Hao Rongming's team as soon as she entered the mine. Every time she went down the mine, the miners chose the best operating tools for her. Once, she held a large handful of shovels in her hand, all of which were tools that the miners had enthusiastically chosen for her. Every time before blasting, the miners always called her to the safest place. Sometimes when working in the mine, when there was too much groundwater, Master Hao would ask her to change places to shovel coal, or let her rest for a while, but little Xu refused. When she was tired, she knelt down to work. Master Hao praised her for being a good person!

　　The miners, like their own worker brothers, often cared about the students' labor safety and helped them learn techniques. Wherever there was difficulty or danger, there would be veteran masters. Under such practical education, the students not only learned coal mining techniques from the miners, but also learned their noble ideological qualities.

　　Close Friends

　　The young college students and the miners lived and worked together for a short period of time. The miners were very satisfied to see that these college students could work hard with them without fear of fatigue. Whether or not they could work was the standard by which the workers measured whether college students were good enough friends. It was in this common labor that they became close friends and established a deep friendship. They worked together during the day and visited each other and talked at night. The college students taught the miners to study culture, and the miners told the college students about the changes in the miners' lives and the struggles in the mines.

　　Based on the many historical facts of the mines told by the miners and the changes in the mines they had seen with their own eyes, the young history students compiled and drew more than 100 hanging pictures with pictures and text, and held an exhibition in the mine. These vivid historical facts not only educated themselves, but also educated the miners.

　　Xu Peng and several other students were left to work as commentators at the exhibition for another three days. When this last group of young people left the mine, they felt particularly nostalgic for the mine. The night before their departure, she ran to the mine entrance to wait for the veteran masters, wanting to see them one last time. The miners in Hao Rongming's team went to work that night at ten o'clock and would not get off work until six o'clock the next day. When Master Hao's entire team heard that their last group of students was about to leave, they blamed Xiao Xu for telling them too late. Master Hao kindly told her to listen to the Party carefully.

　　The next day, Xiao Xu and her classmates took the train at seven o'clock and left the mine early in the morning.

　　They thought that Master Hao was at work and wouldn't see them. However, before the train left, Master Hao Rongming ran to the train station, sweating profusely and out of breath. When he saw Xiao Xu and the others at a glance in the crowd at the station, he shouted happily: "I caught up with you!" He shook Xiao Xu's hand tightly, then took out a large bag of candy from his pocket and stuffed it into Xiao Xu's hand, saying: Take it back to your classmates!

　　The train had already left the Mentougou station, and their eyes were still searching for their Master Hao in the blurry figures.

    新的感情
　　——访问北京师范大学历史系下煤矿劳动的学生
    本报记者　柏生
    夜深了。各个宿舍都已熄了灯。在北京师范大学的一间宽敞的教室里，灯还亮着，几个年轻人，正紧张地埋头写东西。
    谁是历史的主人？
    几天以前，这群历史系的大学生才从门头沟煤矿劳动回来，带着矿山劳动的煤尘，他们还来不及好好洗涤，就投入了紧张编写“门头沟煤矿简史”的工作中。
    是什么力量鼓舞着他们呢？这些历史系的大学生，最初从学校出发到矿山之前，虽然党委领导干部一再叮嘱他们，要做到劳动锻炼改造思想，调查研究，提高教学质量，把文化带到矿山。可是他们思想上却多少还存在着一些疑问，特别是对下矿山和工人一起劳动能不能结合历史专业，提高教学质量，学到历史知识，有很大的怀疑。然而，在短短的一段矿山劳动生活中，完全打破了他们的这些错误的想法。他们的思想感情起了变化，真正地认识了什么叫历史？谁是历史的主人。
    过去，在课堂中，他们曾经被那些帝王将相的家谱，厚古薄今的资产阶级历史学所迷惑，以为只有秦始皇、汉武帝、唐太宗……那些人物才算是历史的真正记载。可是，当他们真正接触了劳动人民，和劳动人民生活在一起，他们认识了只有劳动人民的历史才是一部最丰富的史诗，劳动人民可歌可泣的历史是讲不完写不尽的。
    在这安静的夜晚，教室里只听得擦擦地钢笔划纸的声音，同学们一面写着，不时地为矿工们的历史所激动，不觉地又沉浸在那一段难以忘怀的矿山劳动生活的回忆中。
    劳动的第一课
    门头沟煤矿的早晨。
    井口上比往常显得格外热闹，一群身着黑色矿工服、戴着矿工帽的年轻人，出现在许多老矿工的队伍当中。这些年轻的陌生人，在老矿工的关怀照护下，第一次踏上矿山劳动的讲堂。他们是北京师范大学来矿山参加劳动的历史系学生。
    当电梯似的罐笼，把他们带到离地面三百多公尺的地下矿井时，他们是多么兴奋和激动！
    矿井下到处是一片劳动的声音。当老师傅们把割煤机轰轰地开动了一阵以后，闪亮的煤块顺着斜坡上的溜子，哗哗地滚了下来。第一次踏上劳动讲堂的年轻矿工，紧紧地跟在老师傅的身旁抱住电钻用力打眼，有的忙着帮助师傅们攉煤装罐，有的紧张地把满载着六百公斤重量的煤罐，一罐一罐地推出。这些年轻的新矿工虽然有时感觉四肢已经很疲劳了，可是他们看到老矿工们忘我的劳动干劲，甚至连吃饭的时间也不愿意耽搁的情形，鼓舞着他们更加足了劳动的干劲。
    一次，女同学孙月娥正帮助老师傅抱钻打眼时，忽然一股凉风袭来，那个有经验的老师傅不顾自己的安全，一手仍抱着电钻，一手急忙用力把孙月娥挡到一边，紧接着就听到轰的一声巨煤摔裂的声音，把孙月娥吓了一大跳，她正摸不着头脑是怎么一回事时，再定睛一看，原来就在自己原先工作的地方的顶板上掉下了一大片煤。当时她立刻意识到老师傅对她的无限关怀和爱护，她激动得什么话也说不出来，倒是老师傅和蔼地先开了口：“不要怕，没有关系”。
    上井以后，这个梳着两条短辫的姑娘，一想起当时的情景，就觉得非常激动。她原先在班里，虽然书念的还不错，可是同学们批评她有比较浓厚的个人主义思想，在学习和生活中，常常计较个人的得失。那时她还不以为然，总觉得个人主义思想谁能没有呢！可是这次老工人的行动却给了她深刻的教育，使她认识到工人阶级在任何时候都具有着忘我的高贵品质。孙月娥下决心要彻底改造自己，克服个人主义的思想，向工人学习。
    徐鹏，这个身材矮小，热情肯干的姑娘，一下矿井就被分配到矿工郝荣明班里劳动。每次下井时矿工们都把最好的操作工具挑选给她。一次，她手里竟抱了一大把铲子，都是矿工们热情地给她挑好的工具。每次放炮前，矿工们总是把她招呼到最安全的地方去。有时在井下劳动，地下水冒多了，郝师傅就要她换个地方去攉煤，或者让她去休息一下，可是小徐不肯，累了时，她就跪下去劳动。郝师傅夸奖她是好样的！
      矿工们就像对待自己的工人兄弟一样，经常关怀着同学们的劳动安全，帮助他们学习技术，只要哪里有困难，有危险，哪里就会有老师傅出现。在这样的实际教育下，同学们不但向矿工们学会了采煤的技术，也学习到他们高贵的思想品质。
    亲密的朋友
    年轻的大学生和矿工们在一起劳动生活了短短的一段时间，矿工们见到这些大学生也能和他们一起不怕劳累的苦干，他们感到很满意。能不能劳动，这是工人衡量大学生够不够朋友的标准。就在这种共同的劳动中，他们彼此交成了亲密的朋友，建立了深厚的友谊。上班一起劳动，下班互相访问谈心，大学生教矿工学文化，矿工们给大学生讲矿工生活的变化和矿山的斗争。
    年轻的历史系大学生，根据矿工们讲述的许多矿山史实，和他们亲眼看到的矿山的变化，用图画和文字编绘了一百多幅挂图，就在矿山里举办了一个展览会，这些活生生的史实，不仅教育了他们自己，也教育了矿工。
    徐鹏和几个同学被留下来在展览会上又做了三天的讲解员。当她们这最后一批年轻人离开矿井的时候，格外感到对矿山的留恋，在临行的前一个晚上，她跑到井口上去等老师傅们，想最后见他们一面。郝荣明班的矿工们那天晚上是十点上班，要到第二天六点才能下班，当郝师傅全班听说她们最后一批同学就要离开时，他们直怪小徐告诉他们太晚了。郝师傅亲切地对她说，要好好地听党的话。
    第二天，小徐和同学们赶七点多钟的火车，一清早就离开了矿山。
    他们以为郝师傅正在上班，不会见着了。可是，在开车以前，郝荣明师傅满头大汗，气喘喘地跑到了火车站，当他在车站的人群中一眼望到小徐他们几个人时，他高兴得直喊了起来：“可追上你们了！”他紧紧地握着小徐的手，然后从口袋掏出一大包糖塞到小徐手里说：带回去给同学们！
    火车已经开出了门头沟车站，他们的眼睛还在模糊的人影中寻找他们的郝师傅。
