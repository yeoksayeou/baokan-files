Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 5th: The broad masses of Jiangsu Province are actively engaged in current production, striving for a bumper autumn harvest to welcome the high tide of the movement to establish people's communes.

As of September 1st, 268 people's communes had been established on a trial basis in Jiangsu. Currently, cities and counties are actively preparing for the widespread development of people's communes. In Yancheng County, Xinchang, Yongnan, and Yongbei townships mobilized over 15,000 people for night battles to apply a round of quick-acting fertilizer to all 22,000 mu of late rice in preparation for the establishment of communes.

Areas where communes have already been established have witnessed a new high tide of simultaneous leaps forward in both industrial and agricultural production. After the fourteen agricultural cooperatives of Damao Township in Tongshan County, with a population of over 20,000, established a people's commune in late July, all metalworkers, cadres, school teachers and students, and some members worked intensively for seven days, basically realizing the ball-bearingization of the entire township. After the establishment of the Likou People's Commune in Siyang County, industry and agriculture blossomed across the board, with a massive force surrounding and annihilating pests; within three days, the entire commune established 213 factories.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, September 5th: Zhejiang Province is comprehensively launching pilot projects for establishing people's communes in rural areas. As of September 3rd, 101 people's communes had been established in 86 counties and cities across the province. Many counties that started piloting earlier are expanding from points to areas.

Because the establishment of communes is closely integrated with production, new high tides of production have emerged in various communes before and after their establishment. In the cotton-growing area of Cixi County, the Wudongzha People's Commune has more than 10,000 people participating in drought resistance and fertilizer accumulation every day, accumulating 3.56 million dan of local and miscellaneous fertilizers in a few days; pests have been eradicated from over 40,000 mu of cotton and over 20,000 mu of rice throughout the commune, and fertilizer has been applied twice. On the eve of the establishment of the Fojian People's Commune in Yiwu County, members accumulated more than one million dan of fertilizer overnight as a gift to celebrate the birth of the people's commune. In Ningbo, Jinhua, Jiande, Jiaxing and other special districts, the attendance rate and labor efficiency of commune members have significantly increased after the establishment of many people's communes.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, September 5th: People of Han, Miao, Buyi, Dong, Shui, and other ethnic groups living in the vast mountainous areas of Guizhou Province are jubilantly welcoming the high tide of establishing people's communes. Currently, there are over one hundred people's communes that have begun trial operations or have already been established.

In the upsurge of actively preparing for and rapidly establishing people's communes, the Han, Miao, and Buyi farmers in the suburbs of Guiyang City are at the forefront. As of September 4th, the suburbs of Guiyang City have achieved people's communization. On the basis of the original 161 agricultural cooperatives, 26 people's communes have been established, and the number of peasant households joining the people's communes accounts for 99.9% of the total number of peasant households in the entire suburbs.

After studying the urgent demands and active preparations of the people of all ethnic groups in the province for establishing people's communes, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to various regions at the end of August, requiring them to immediately formulate plans, conduct pilot projects, and then universally carry out this movement after the pilot projects, striving to basically complete it before the end of autumn.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, September 5th: The pilot work of establishing people's communes in Yunnan Province has been universally launched in various regions. As of September 4th, a total of 56 communes have been established. Currently, pilot areas are continuously summarizing experiences and helping other areas train cadres. It is expected that a high tide of establishing people's communes will appear in September.

In order to ensure the smooth and healthy development of the work of establishing people's communes, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all regions to first conduct pilot projects, obtain experience, and make full preparations before fully launching the work; at the same time, it particularly emphasized that the establishment of people's communes must be closely integrated with current production, fully mobilize the masses through extensive airing of views, posting of big-character posters, and holding debates, and establish communes on the basis of the voluntary participation of the masses.

The masses in areas that are currently conducting pilot projects and where communes have been established are very enthusiastic about production. They are all taking action to strengthen late-stage field management and prepare for autumn harvest and autumn planting, giving full play to the superiority of the people's communes.

　　用生产成绩向公社献礼
    江苏浙江贵州云南建社工作密切结合生产
    据新华社南京5日电　江苏省广大群众积极投入当前生产，争取秋季大丰收来迎接建立人民公社运动的高潮。
    到1日止，江苏各地已试办人民公社二百六十八个。目前，各市、县正在积极筹备人民公社的普遍发展。盐城县新场、永南、永北三个乡为了迎接建社，有一万五千多人投入夜战，二万二千亩晚稻全部追上一遍速效肥。
    已经建立公社的地区，更是出现了工农业生产齐头跃进的新高潮。铜山县大庙乡十四个农业社、两万多人口在7月下旬成立人民公社后，所有的铁工、干部、学校师生和一部分社员突击七天，使全乡基本实现了滚珠轴承化。泗阳县李口人民公社成立后，工农业全面开花，千军万马围歼虫害；三天内，全公社办厂两百一十三个。
    据新华社杭州5日电　浙江省农村中全面展开建立人民公社试点工作。到9月3日止，全省八十六个县市已建立起一百零一个人民公社。许多试点较早的县正由点向面推开。
    由于建立公社密切结合生产，各地公社在建立前后都出现了新的生产高潮。慈溪县棉区五洞闸人民公社每天有一万多人参加抗旱和积肥，几天内就积起土杂肥三百五十六万担；全公社四万多亩棉花和两万多亩水稻普遍除了虫，并且施了两次肥。义乌县佛坚人民公社成立前夕，社员们连夜积了一百多万担肥，作为人民公社诞生的献礼。宁波、金华、建德、嘉兴等专区许多人民公社建立后，社员出勤率和劳动效率都显著提高。
    据新华社贵阳5日电　居住在贵州省广大山区的汉、苗、布依、侗、水等族人民，欢欣鼓舞地迎接办人民公社的高潮。目前开始试办和已经办成的人民公社共有一百多个。
    在积极准备和迅速建立人民公社的热潮中，贵阳市郊区的汉、苗和布依族农民走在最前面。到4日止，贵阳市郊区已实现人民公社化，在原有一百六十一个农业社的基础上，建立了二十六个人民公社，加入人民公社的农户占全郊区农户总数的99.9％。
    中共贵州省委研究了全省各族人民迫切要求和积极准备办人民公社的情况后，在8月底向各地发出了指示，要求立即制定规划，进行试点，经过试点把这一运动普遍开展起来，争取在秋末以前基本结束。
    据新华社昆明5日电　云南省建立人民公社的试点工作已在各地普遍展开。到4日为止，共已建立五十六个公社。目前试点地区正陆续总结经验，并且帮助其他地区训练干部。预计9月份内就要出现办人民公社的高潮。
    为了使建立人民公社的工作顺利健康地发展，中共云南省委指示各地必须先试点，取得经验，作好充分准备后再全面展开；同时特别强调办人民公社必须密切结合当前生产，通过大鸣大放贴大字报和大辩论充分发动群众，在群众自愿的基础上办公社。
    现在进行试点和已成立公社的地区，群众生产热情很高，都以加强田间后期管理，作好秋收秋种准备工作的行动，发挥人民公社的优越性。
