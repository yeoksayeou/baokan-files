　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th - According to TASS Moscow, the Soviet government sent a note to the U.S. government on the 3rd, protesting the U.S. releasing balloons into Soviet airspace. The Soviet government hopes that the U.S. government will immediately take measures to stop these actions by the U.S. authorities.
    The Soviet government said in the note, which was delivered by Deputy Foreign Minister Zarubin to the chargé d'affaires ad interim of the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union, that recently, several balloons with instruments were intercepted in Soviet airspace, including automatic aerial terrain photography cameras, radio transceivers, etc. Examination of the instruments proved that they were made in the United States and the balloons were launched by the U.S. Air Force.
    As everyone knows, the U.S. government once stated in a note to the Soviet government on February 8, 1956, that it would take measures to ensure that no balloons that could fly over Soviet airspace would be launched in the future.

　　抗议美国气球侵犯领空
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府在3日照会美国政府，抗议美国把气球放入苏联领空。苏联政府希望美国政府立即采取措施制止美国当局的这种行动。
    苏联政府在这份由外交部副部长查鲁宾交给美国驻苏联大使馆临时代办的照会中说，最近在苏联领空截获了若干带有仪器的气球，仪器中包括空中地形摄影自动照像机、无线电收发报机等。对仪器的检查证明，仪器是美国制造的，气球是美国空军发射的。
    大家知道，美国政府曾经在1956年2月8日给苏联政府的照会中表示过，它将采取措施来保证今后不允许发射可能飞越苏联领空的气球。
