Comrade Liu Shaoqi in Xushui
Kang Tuo

Less than forty days after Chairman Mao inspected Xushui, Comrade Liu Shaoqi came to Xushui again and inspected it for more than a day.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi arrived here at 4:30 p.m. on September 10th and did not leave until 6:00 p.m. on the 11th, with very little rest even at night. Our Party Central Committee's Vice Chairman Liu, disregarding his hard work and fatigue, his sweat-soaked clothes, the scorching sun in the crops, and the scorching heat of the iron furnace, walked with full energy and radiance throughout the vast areas of Xushui's urban and rural areas. Comrade Shaoqi's thoughts, words, and smiling face were thus deeply imprinted in the hearts of the people of Xushui, and imprinted on this plain and mountainous area that is forever leaping forward and boiling.

In the Urbanized Xie Fang Village

Comrade Shaoqi, accompanied by Xie Xuegong, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, Song Lian, Secretary of the Baoding Prefectural Party Committee Secretariat, and Zhang Guozhong, First Secretary of the Xushui County Party Committee, arrived at Xie Fang of the Suicheng People's Commune at 5:00 p.m. on the 10th to inspect this urbanized village. Comrade Shaoqi walked into the village from outside, and immediately went over to the livestock competition field when he saw guns were set up. The male and female militia members who were working there immediately gathered around, cheering and applauding. Then, like an emergency assembly, they put down their shovels and picked up their guns, accepting the inspection of Comrade Shaoqi. These energetic young people, the men with shiny bayonets on their rifles, and the women with carbines, all stood up straight, staring at Comrade Shaoqi with solemn, excited, and joyful eyes. Comrade Shaoqi greeted everyone and asked if they had cleaned their guns. He then took a gun, skillfully opened the bolt, inspected it, and then handed the gun back with a satisfied smile. At this time, the militia members could not help but raise their arms and shout:

"Long live the Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao! We wish Comrade Liu Shaoqi good health!"

As Comrade Shaoqi said goodbye, this group of commune members and militia members cheered and applauded once again. Then, they shouldered their guns and threw themselves into intensive production.

The children in the kindergarten were playing on seesaws, slides, and wooden horses in the kindergarten park. Comrade Shaoqi walked over with a smile, bent down, shook hands with the children who were jumping and surrounding him, listened to them singing, and talked to the caregivers. Afterwards, he went to the Happiness Home, looked at the houses where the elderly lived and the Happiness Home rules posted on the wall, and sat with the elderly in the courtyard, asking in detail about the living conditions in the home, and telling these elderly people, who were so touched by their happiness that they couldn't stop moving, to rest more every day in addition to exercising their muscles and bones. The elderly also chatted with Comrade Shaoqi as if old friends were confiding in each other.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi inspected Xie Fang for a full two hours. He looked at the pig farm, sewing factory, clinic, club, Red and Expert School, fish pond, power plant, and grain processing factory, as well as the supply and marketing cooperative, canteen, auditorium, and the bathhouse called Happiness Pool. Our leader, wearing an ordinary white shirt, gray pants, and cloth shoes, with gray hair and a smiling face, was energetic and never tired. Wherever he went, he raised his hand to greet everyone, shook hands and talked with them, and was simple and approachable, like a kind elder in our big family, a warm and affectionate best comrade. He looked at everything very carefully, asked questions in great detail, and gave instructions at any time.

Comrade Shaoqi attached great importance to the issue of tree planting. When he looked at the auditorium, Comrade Shaoqi found that there were fewer trees in the village's construction plan and immediately told Zhu Chunsheng, the village branch secretary, that "some more should be added." When he saw trees at the satellite pig farm, he praised it and said:

"This is a good method! In addition to planting trees, you should also plant melons next to the pigsty!"

Branch Secretary Zhu Chunsheng assured Comrade Shaoqi that he would definitely do it. However, Zhu Chunsheng was also somewhat nervous, fearing that he would not be able to answer Comrade Shaoqi's questions well. In fact, he answered quite thoughtfully. After Comrade Shaoqi learned about various situations in detail at the Red and Expert School, he knew that Zhu Chunsheng taught political classes there, so he asked him what he taught and how he taught them. He said that he mainly talked about the Party's general line and the materials in the newspapers, and talked about the specific situation. Comrade Shaoqi quickly said:

"Yes! Teach it like that! Very good!"

Comrade Shaoqi also asked Zhu Chunsheng about the labor force situation in the village and the children's enrollment situation, and was very concerned about secondary education in rural areas. After learning that they had focused on high yields of yams and planned to produce more than 2,000 catties of grain per mu this year, he quickly told everyone that yams can be used to make sugar, powder, wine, alcohol, rubber, and pastries, and can also be used to feed pigs, so everyone should make good use of them. Before and after entering the village, Comrade Shaoqi also repeatedly looked at multi-spike corn with great interest, praised this high-yield crop, and asked if ordinary corn here had bamboo sticks inserted in them. Comrade Shaoqi also expressed satisfaction with the urbanized construction of Xie Fang, and repeatedly praised the murals here as being well-painted.

On this day, the sky was clear and cloudless, and the golden sunlight in the evening and the enthusiastic welcome of the Xie Fang people closely followed Comrade Liu Shaoqi; and Comrade Shaoqi also brought valuable strength to Xie Fang, bringing greater enthusiasm and the greatest ambition to strive for the top.

In Shangzhuang People's Commune

On the morning of the 11th, Comrade Liu Shaoqi arrived at Shangzhuang People's Commune. He first inspected the livestock farm, and then walked to the bank of the Pu River by the village, asked about the situation of the Pu River, and suggested building a gate in the river to raise the water level to facilitate self-flowing irrigation, shipping, and power generation. Comrade Shaoqi was very concerned about the irrigation of the land. Yesterday, next to the engine and boiler well outside Xie Fang Village, he talked about irrigation with the young engine and boiler operator Qi Jiaxiang, and asked Qi Jiaxiang to calculate the amount of water pumped every day. Today, in Dasi Gezhuang, he studied a problem with the female engine and boiler operator Yan Fengzhen next to the well. Comrade Shaoqi said:

"The water pumped from the well in summer is too cold. Would it be possible to build a large pool next to the well, pump the water out, put it in the pool, and let it bask in the sun for a day before watering the ground?"

Not only Yan Fengzhen, but everyone felt that this was a very good method. Comrade Shaoqi also said that this method could also continuously and fully utilize the pumping machines, could store sufficient water, and could ensure that one well could supply the needs of 1,000 mu of land.

On this day, the weather was equally good, and Comrade Shaoqi's interest was also extremely high. He looked at the canteen in Shangzhuang, shook hands with the female workers with wet hands when passing by the laundry, and told everyone that there was a washing machine in Tianjin that could be operated by two people and wash more than 1,000 pieces of clothing a day. County Party Secretary Zhang Guozhong immediately agreed to buy that kind of washing machine. Comrade Shaoqi also looked at the children's bedrooms, kitchens, and toys in the Shangzhuang Kindergarten, and listened with a smile to the children singing to him:

Parents go to production, send me to the kindergarten.
There are many friends in the kindergarten, singing and dancing is so happy!

After leaving Shangzhuang, Comrade Shaoqi walked more than a li outside the village of Dasi Gezhuang in this commune, looked at the high-yield cotton that was nearly seven feet tall and the high-yield millet that was more than half a person tall, looked at the plum-shaped densely planted corn and the transplanted densely planted corn, looked at the famous high-yield Chinese cabbage, and also looked at five or six different cultivation methods of high-yield yams and the biogas experimental field. Comrade Shaoqi held the greatest concern for the high-yield land, almost forgetting his fatigue, and seemed not to feel that his shirt was already soaked with sweat. Sometimes he even took off his straw hat and kept looking and asking questions non-stop. When he heard that some people here were irrigating crops with dog meat soup and giving injections—injecting glucose, sesame oil, and cottonseed oil, he couldn't help but say humorously and wittily:

"Is that really effective? Haha! Then you can raise dogs! Dogs reproduce very easily!"

When inspecting the high-yield land, there were more valuable instructions given at any time and place. After seeing some densely planted crops, Comrade Shaoqi said:

"Your method of planting large ridges here is good! Just leave a small ridge between the ridges so that people can get in. If you want to weed or thin the seedlings, you can make a small hoe that is an inch wide, or you can use tweezers."

Comrade Shaoqi also greatly appreciated the conical planting method and other pile-shaped planting methods in the biogas experimental field. He said:

"This is a good method! This three-dimensional method is beneficial even if you don't use biogas. This can increase the area of the land and also absorb more sunlight. Among all three-dimensional objects of the same area, the spherical shape absorbs the most sunlight."

After seeing many high-yield satellite fields and experimental fields, Comrade Shaoqi also suggested to Zhan Dengke, First Secretary of the Shangzhuang People's Commune Party Committee, and the accompanying people that everyone should specifically calculate an account. For example, when planting sorghum, is it more cost-effective to plant one mu with a yield of 20,000 catties, or to plant ten mu with a yield of 2,000 catties per mu. Comrade Shaoqi said that it is probably more cost-effective to plant less and produce more, but this requires a detailed calculation and comparison of the labor, fertilizer, water, etc. spent on the above one mu and ten mu, and then draw a conclusion to convince everyone. Comrade Shaoqi said, "This requires bold experimentation. Don't be afraid of failure in experiments. Failures are always in a small range, and there is no criticism for failure. The Western medicine 606 failed 605 times. We must have the spirit of not being afraid of failure. If the experiment is successful, it will be promoted. Experimentation is for the purpose of promotion."

Comrade Shaoqi also made many other important instructions in Shangzhuang People's Commune. When he saw that everyone there was proud of the special product, Chinese cabbage, he smiled and issued a "warning," saying that other places would definitely learn from you and grow better cabbage, and then you would have to consider the market problem of cabbage! When he heard that a piece of bad land was designated as a public cemetery, he suggested planting flowers and trees in the cemetery and asking artists to design it to turn the graveyard that people used to feel sad about into a park that everyone would be happy to see. When people reported that many upper-middle peasants had dedicated the grain they had buried for many years after the establishment of the commune, he immediately suggested that when there is more grain in the future, a batch of grain can be distributed to each commune member to be stored, because everyone eats in the canteen anyway, and the stored grain certainly cannot be eaten.

Before leaving Shangzhuang People's Commune, Comrade Shaoqi also participated in the labor of deep plowing the high-yield wheat fields and turning over the yam seedlings with the members of Dasi Gezhuang. At this time, the applause and cheers surrounding Comrade Shaoqi suddenly calmed down, and some members were moved to tears and speechless. After Comrade Shaoqi left, the members who were turning over the yam seedlings were full of energy and finished turning over five mu of seedlings in one go as if they were charging; the eighteen-year-old girl Yan Suhua said:

"I will finish this piece of land even if I don't eat! This is the land that our Party Central Committee Vice Chairman Liu turned over!"

In Poor and Empty Factories and Universities

Before going to Shangzhuang Commune on the morning of the 11th, Comrade Liu Shaoqi inspected the joint iron and steel smelting plant of Xushui and Anxin. In the afternoon, he inspected Xushui University, Xushui Machine and Iron Factory, and the Bacterial Fertilizer Factory. On the evening of the 10th, when the county party committee reported to Comrade Shaoqi on the county's mechanization and electrification plan, our Vice Chairman Liu repeatedly emphasized that tractors, cars, and generators all need steel! Comrade Shaoqi's time in Xushui was spent instructing and encouraging people to produce more steel everywhere. In the smelting plant and the machine and iron factory, he meticulously walked through all the workshops.

The smelting plant was newly established on the basis of being poor and empty. Everywhere there are bricks, tiles, iron and stone, small blast furnaces and native furnaces that are being produced or being built, temporary sleeping tents and straw sheds, a boiling sea of people and soaring red fire. Comrade Liu Shaoqi liked these things very much and almost specifically looked for places where red light filled the sky to inspect. Under the guidance of the comrades of the Xushui County Party Committee and the Anxin County Party Committee, he looked at every small blast furnace and native furnace, picked up various iron ores for comparison and inquiry, studied small wind gourds and large blowers and hot blast stoves, calculated the raw materials and finished products of each furnace, and talked with iron smelters, ore smashing laborers, and female machinists. Once he even stepped on the iron slag that had just been discharged from the furnace and was scorching hot. In that open-air battlefield, Comrade Shaoqi not only raised his hand from time to time to respond to people's passionate applause; but also, after watching a furnace of iron being released, he shook hands with the workers and then applauded enthusiastically to congratulate everyone. It should be said that Comrade Shaoqi simply personally participated in the iron smelting there.

Comrade Shaoqi, like Chairman Mao, also inspected the entire process of producing nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the bacterial fertilizer factory. In the machine and iron factory, he greatly praised the scale of the blast furnace built from scratch and the dozen or so lathes, as well as the sand-casting products. When he saw that they had also manufactured machine parts for the Daye Iron and Steel Plant, he was especially surprised and delighted. A comrade next to him said:

"We are also ants gnawing at bones!"

Comrade Liu Shaoqi nodded in agreement.

Comrade Shaoqi also had great interest in the poor and empty Xushui University. He learned in detail about the basic situation of the school and the arrangement of half-farming (or half-working) and half-studying. After looking at the fifteen courses and 1,790 class hours planned for the agriculture department, which graduates in two years, he happily smiled and said:

"Very good! You learn business first and then basic theory. This is from practice to theory, which is very correct!" After learning that the university and the county science institute shared some instruments and equipment, he said: "Good! You will slowly build a regular university, similar to those in big cities, or perhaps even better!"

Comrade Shaoqi instructed the county to develop high schools as a reserve for the development of universities; and suggested that Secretary Xie of the Provincial Party Committee help Xushui University solve the problem of two or three teachers. Then, Comrade Shaoqi cordially inquired about the study and living conditions of the student representative Chang Yunge and others, and then looked at the soil fertilizer factory of the agriculture department and the iron workshop of the mechanical department. Seeing the students tying oilcloth around their waists and forging iron next to the furnace and the ball bearings they made, Comrade Shaoqi excitedly smiled and said:

"These are our university students!"

In the Depths of the Hearts of the People of the Whole County

In more than a day, Comrade Liu Shaoqi did not only inspect a few places in Xushui's urban and rural areas, but also deeply penetrated into the depths of the hearts of the people of the whole county. Comrade Shaoqi also made many wonderful and broad arrangements for the production and life of the people of the whole county through the Xushui County Party Committee and the Shangzhuang Commune Party Committee.

Comrade Shaoqi not only read the draft plan of the Xushui County Party Committee on the comprehensive leap forward in recent years before the inspection, but also remembered it very clearly. Regarding the layout of industrial development here, Comrade Shaoqi felt that there were some problems with the plan and gave profound and comprehensive instructions to the county party committee. Comrade Shaoqi quoted Mencius's words "and one person's body is prepared for the work of a hundred craftsmen," to brilliantly illustrate the complexity and importance of production planning and arrangement. After affirming the wage system of in-kind plus currency requested by the commune members here, he also instructed the county party committee with the above-mentioned words of Mencius that it must carefully consider the ratio of in-kind and currency in order to meet the complex living needs of the commune members. Comrade Shaoqi also instructed the county party committee to calculate a detailed account of the manpower in all aspects of industry, agriculture, logistics, and culture and education in the county, and also cited the words of "The Book of Rites": "If there are many who produce, few who consume, those who work quickly, and those who use comfortably, then wealth will always be sufficient!" Let the county party committee try to minimize non-production personnel and non-production time based on the above detailed account. Since the communes in Xushui have largely realized the system of ownership by the whole people, Comrade Shaoqi also told everyone that the system of ownership by the whole people is not yet communist in nature, and asked everyone to study the Central Committee's resolution on the establishment of people's communes, and fully realize that only when social products are extremely abundant, the people's communist awareness is greatly improved, and universal education is popularized and improved, everyone works half a day and studies culture half a day, and the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and physical labor gradually disappear, can we enter the communist era; however, Comrade Shaoqi gave the greatest encouragement and praise to the enthusiasm and drive of the people of Xushui who urgently desire to transition to communism as soon as possible.

All of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's instructions have penetrated deeply into people's hearts as quickly as lightning, and communes and villages have held carnival celebrations and oath-taking meetings to leap forward towards higher peaks. In Shangzhuang Commune, more than half a day on the 12th was spent planting wheat and harvesting autumn on 7,000 mu of land. Caohe Commune immediately streamlined 2,000 non-production personnel from the logistics department and put them into production. The No. 12 native furnace in the smelting plant created a new record of producing one and a half tons of iron per day. The people of Xushui regarded happiness, honor, and great responsibility as one thing, and everyone was inspired with soaring enthusiasm and a determination and confidence to ensure a permanent leap forward.

    刘少奇同志在徐水
    康濯
    在毛主席视察徐水以后，不到四十天，刘少奇同志又来到了徐水，在徐水视察了一天多时光。
    刘少奇同志从9月10日下午四点半钟来到这儿，直到11日下午六点离开，几乎是黑夜都很少休息。我们党中央的刘副主席不顾辛劳疲累，不顾汗透的衣衫，不顾庄稼丛中灼热的阳光和铁水炉边的炙人的红火，一直精力饱满和神采焕发地走过了徐水城乡的广大地区。少奇同志的思想、言谈和容光笑貌，也就这样深深刻印在徐水人民的心头，刻印在这儿永远跃进着和沸腾着的平川和山地。
    在城市化的谢坊村
    少奇同志由河北省委书记处书记解学恭、保定地委书记处书记宋琏和徐水县委第一书记张国忠等陪同，在10日下午五点钟首先到了遂城人民公社的谢坊，视察了这个城市化的村子。少奇同志从村外步行进村，一眼看到牲畜比赛场上架着枪，就立即走了过去。正在那里做活的男女基干民兵，马上便围拢来欢呼鼓掌；随后又像紧急集合一样，放下铁锨背起枪，接受了少奇同志的检阅。这些满身干劲的青年，男的背着刺刀雪亮的步枪，女的背着卡宾枪，个个昂头挺胸，一动不动地睁着庄严而又兴奋欢乐的眼睛，直望住少奇同志。少奇同志向大家问好，又问大家擦过枪没有；并且接过一支枪来，熟练地打开枪拴检查了一遍，然后满意地笑着递还了枪。这时候，民兵们抑制不住地振臂高呼：
    “共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！祝刘少奇同志健康！”
    在少奇同志告别的时候，这一伙公社社员和民兵又一次鼓掌欢呼。接着就架起枪来，投入了紧张的生产。
    幼儿园的孩子们正在幼儿公园里玩撬板、滑梯和木马。少奇同志笑嘻嘻地走过去，俯下身子和蹦跳着围上来的小孩们握手，并且听他们唱歌，同保育员谈话。随后就去到幸福院，看了老人们住的房子和墙上贴的幸福院制度，又和老人们一道坐在院里，详尽地问了院里的生活情况，同老人们闲谈了一阵，要这些为幸福感动得歇不住手脚的老人每天除了活动活动筋骨以外，还是得多多休息。老人们也跟少奇同志对答着家常话，那谈话的气氛就如同老朋友在互吐衷肠。
    刘少奇同志在谢坊整整视察了两个钟头。他看了猪场、缝纫工厂、诊疗所、俱乐部、红专学校、养鱼池、发电所和粮食加工厂，也看了供销部、食堂、礼堂和名叫幸福池的澡堂。我们的领袖穿着普通的白衬衫、灰裤子和布鞋，一头灰发，满脸笑容，精力旺盛得永不疲倦。走到哪里都举起手来同大家招呼，和大家握手谈笑，朴素平易得就像我们大家庭中的一个谦和的长者，一个热情而亲切的最好的同志。他在每一个地方都看得非常仔细，问话也问得十分细致，而且随时给以指示。
    少奇同志很重视植树问题。在看礼堂的时候，少奇同志发现本村建设规划上的树木少了，马上告诉村支部书记朱春生“应该增加一些”。在卫星猪场看到有树，就很为称赞，并且说：
    “这是个办法！除了栽树，猪圈旁边还应该种瓜！”
    支部书记朱春生对少奇同志的指示都保证一定办到。但朱春生也多少有点儿紧张，对少奇同志提出的问题总怕回答得不好。其实他都回答得相当周到。少奇同志在红专学校里详尽地了解了种种情况以后，知道朱春生在那儿教政治课，就曾问他都教的什么，怎么教的；他说他主要是讲党的总路线和报上的材料，并谈了谈具体情况，少奇同志忙说：
    “对！就这么教！很好！”
    少奇同志还向朱春生了解了村里劳力的情况和儿童入学的情况，而且十分关心农村的中学教育。在知道这里抓住山药高产和计划今年亩产粮食两千多斤以后，连忙告诉大家说，山药可以制糖、粉、酒、酒精、橡胶和点心，还可以喂猪，要大家好好利用。少奇同志在进村以前和进村以后，还曾先后几次兴致极高地看了多穗玉米，对这种高产作物很为称赞，并问这儿一般的玉米有没有插竹扦。少奇同志对谢坊城市化的建设也表示满意，又几次夸奖这儿的壁画画得好。
    这一天，晴空万里，傍晚的金色的阳光和谢坊人的热烈的欢迎，一直紧紧跟随着刘少奇同志；而少奇同志也给谢坊带来了宝贵的力量，带来了更大的干劲和力争上游最大的雄心。
    在商庄人民公社
    11日上午，刘少奇同志到了商庄人民公社。首先视察了畜牧场，然后走到村边的瀑河岸上，问了问瀑河的情况，并建议在河中筑闸提高水位，以便利自流灌溉和行船、发电。少奇同志十分关心土地的灌溉，昨天在谢坊村外的机井旁边，就和年轻的锅驼机手祁家祥谈过灌溉问题，并让祁家祥给他算了算每天抽水的数量。今天在大寺各庄，又在机井旁边和女锅驼机手阎凤珍研究了一个问题。少奇同志说：
    “夏天从机井里抽上来的水太凉，要是在机井边上作个大水池，抽出水来放池子里晒上一天再浇地，这样办行么？”
    不仅是阎凤珍，所有的人都感到这是个很好的办法。少奇同志又说，这个办法还可以不停地充分利用抽水机器，可以储备丰足的水，可以使一眼机井保证供应一千亩地的需要。
    这一天，天气同样很好，少奇同志兴趣也极高。他看了商庄的食堂，路过洗衣房就和手上水淋淋的女工握手，并告诉大家，天津有一种洗衣机，两个人操作，一天可以洗一千多件衣服。县委书记张国忠马上答应去买那种洗衣机。少奇同志还在商庄幼儿园里看了小孩们的卧室、厨房和玩具，并且笑嘻嘻地听小孩们给他唱道：
    爸爸妈妈去生产，把我送到幼儿园。
    幼儿园里朋友多，唱歌跳舞多快乐！
    离开商庄以后，少奇同志在这个公社的大寺各庄村外走了一里多地，看了近七尺高的丰产棉花和半人多高的丰产谷子，看了梅花形的密植玉米和移栽的密植玉米，看了有名的丰产大白菜，也看了五六种耕作法不同的高产山药和沼气试验场。少奇同志对丰产地抱着最大的关怀，简直忘记了疲劳，好像也并没感觉到衬衫已经汗湿，有时甚至还取下草帽，一刻不停地又看又问。他听说这里有人给庄稼灌狗肉汤和打针——打葡萄糖，打胡麻油和棉油，不禁诙谐而风趣地说：
    “那么作真有效果么？哈哈！那你们可以养狗啊！狗很容易繁殖嘛！”
    在视察丰产地的时候，更多的是随时随地给予的宝贵指示。看过一些密植作物，少奇同志说：
    “你们这里种大畦子的办法不错！只要畦跟畦之间留个小垅道，能进去人就行。要锄草、间苗的话，可以作个寸把宽的小锄，也可以用镊子夹。”
    少奇同志还很欣赏沼气试验场的圆锥形种植法和其它的堆形种植法，他说：
    “这是个好办法！这种立体办法，不搞沼气也有好处。这可以增多土地的面积，也可以更多地吸收太阳光。凡是同样面积的立体，以球形的吸收太阳光最多最大。”
    看过许多丰产卫星田和试验田，少奇同志还向商庄人民公社党委第一书记詹登科和陪同的人提议，要大家具体地算一笔账，比如说种高粱，是种一亩亩产两万斤的合算，还是种十亩亩产两千斤的合算。少奇同志说，大概是少种、多产的合算一些，不过这就要把上面的一亩和十亩所花的工、肥、水等等细致地算算并加以比较，然后得出个结论，才能说服大家。少奇同志说，“这就需要大胆试验。试验的东西不要怕失败，失败了也总是小范围的，失败了也不批评。西药六○六就失败了六百零五次。我们要有不怕失败的精神。试验成功了就推广，试验就是为了推广。”
    少奇同志在商庄人民公社还作了许许多多重要的指示。他看到那里人人以特产大白菜而自豪，就笑着提出“警告”说，别的地方一定也会学习你们并且种出更好的白菜，那时候你们就得考虑白菜的市场问题啦！听说那里划了一片坏地作公墓，就建议给公墓栽花种树，并请美术家设计一下，把过去人们一见就难过的坟地变成大家看了都高高兴兴的公园。人们汇报了公社成立后不少上中农怎样献出了多年埋藏的粮食，就马上提出今后粮食多了，可以给每户社员分发一批粮食保存起来，反正人人吃食堂，存粮当然不能吃。
    在离开商庄人民公社以前，少奇同志还和大寺各庄的社员们一道，参加了深掘丰产麦田和翻山药秧的劳动。这时候，簇拥着少奇同志的掌声和欢呼突然平静下来，有些社员感动得热泪盈眶和张嘴结舌。在少奇同志走了以后，翻山药秧的社员浑身是劲，宛若冲锋般地一鼓作气就把五亩秧子翻完；十八岁的姑娘阎素花说：
    “这块地我就是不吃饭，一个人也要翻完呀！这是咱们党中央刘副主席翻过的地啊！”
    在一穷二白的工厂和大学
    刘少奇同志在11日上午去商庄公社以前，曾经视察了徐水和安新的联合钢铁冶炼厂。下午又视察了徐水大学、徐水机铁厂和细菌肥料厂。在10日晚间，县委向少奇同志汇报全县机械化电气化规划的时候，我们的刘副主席就再三强调地说过，拖拉机也好，汽车也好，发电机也好，都要有钢铁！少奇同志在徐水的时光，也就处处指示和鼓舞人们多生产钢铁；在冶炼厂和机铁厂，更是细致入微地走遍了所有的车间。
    冶炼厂是在一穷二白的基础上刚刚建立起来的。到处是砖瓦铁石，是正在生产或正在修建的小高炉和土炉，是临时睡觉的帐棚席棚，是沸腾的人海和冲天的红火。刘少奇同志非常喜欢这些东西，几乎是专找红光漫天的所在视察。他在徐水县委和安新县委同志的引导下，看了每一座小高炉和土炉，拾起各种铁矿石加以比较和询问，研究小的风葫芦和大的鼓风机以及暖风室，计算每一炉的原料和成品，同炼铁工人、砸矿石的小工以及女机器手谈话，有一回甚至还踩到了刚刚出炉而火烫熏人的铁渣上。在那个露天的战场，少奇同志不仅时时高扬着手，回答人们激情的鼓掌；并且还在看过一炉出铁之后，伸出巴掌同工人握手，接着又热烈地鼓掌祝贺大家。应该说，少奇同志简直就亲身参加了那儿的炼铁。
    少奇同志也和毛主席一样，视察了细菌肥料厂生产固氮菌的全部过程。在机铁厂，对那里白手兴建的高炉和十几台车床的规模以及翻砂的产品更是称赏备至。看到那里还制出了给大冶钢厂加工的机器部件，尤其惊喜交集，旁边一个同志说：
    “咱们这也是蚂蚁啃骨头！”
    刘少奇同志点头表示同意。
    对于一穷二白的徐水大学，少奇同志兴趣也极大。他详细了解了学校的基本情况和半耕（或半工）半读的安排，并在看了二年毕业的农业系讲授的十五门课程和一千七百九十个课时的规划以后，高兴地笑道：
    “很好嘛！你们先学业务，后学基础理论，这就是从实际到理论，很对！”知道大学和县里科学研究所共有一部分仪器设备以后，又说：“好呀！你们慢慢地就会办成正规大学，同大城市的差不多，或许比那还要好呢！”
    少奇同志指示县里要发展高中，以作为发展大学的后备；并且建议省委解书记帮助徐水大学解决三两个教员。然后，少奇同志向学员代表常云阁等亲切地询问了学习和生活情况，接着又看了农业系的土造化肥厂和机械系的铁工场；看到在炉边打铁的腰系油布的学生和他们制出的滚珠轴承，少奇同志兴奋地笑道：
    “这才是我们的大学生啊！”
    在全县人民的心灵深处
    在一天多的时刻里，刘少奇同志并不只是视察了徐水城乡的几个地方，而是深入到了全县人民的心灵深处。少奇同志还曾通过徐水县委和商庄公社党委，对全县人民的生产和生活作了许多美妙而宽广的安排。
    徐水县委关于最近几年全面跃进的规划草案，少奇同志不仅在视察以前就看过，而且还记得非常清楚。关于这里工业发展的布局，少奇同志就感到规划得有些毛病，并向县委作了深刻而全面的指示。少奇同志引用孟子的话“且一人之身而百工之所为备”，精辟地说明了生产规划安排的复杂性和重要性。在肯定了这里公社社员要求的实物加货币的工资制以后，也同样以孟子上述的话，指示县委必须慎重考虑实物和货币的比例，以便于满足社员们复杂的生活需要。少奇同志还指示县委对全县工、农、后勤和文教各方面的人力算一笔细账，又引证“礼记”上面的话：“生之者众，食之者寡，为之者疾，用之者舒，则财恒足矣！”让县委根据上述细账，设法使非生产人员和非生产时间尽量减少。由于徐水的公社已经在很大程度上实现了全民所有制，少奇同志又告诉大家，全民所有制还并不就是共产主义性质的，要大家学习中央关于建立人民公社的决议，充分认识只有社会产品极大地丰富了，人民的共产主义觉悟极大地提高和全民教育普及与提高了，大家都半天劳动和半天学文化，工农、城乡以及脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别都逐步消失了，这才得以进入共产主义时代；不过，少奇同志对徐水人民急迫渴望早日向共产主义过渡的热情和干劲，却给予了最大的鼓舞和赞扬。
    刘少奇同志的全部指示已经快如闪电般地深入人心，社社村村都举行了狂欢庆祝和向着更高峰跃进的宣誓大会。商庄公社12日的半天多就种麦和收秋七千亩，漕河公社马上从后勤部门精简了两千非生产人员投入了生产，冶炼厂的十二号土炉创造了日产一吨半铁的新纪录。徐水人民把幸福、光荣和重大的责任当作了一件事，一个个都鼓起了直上云霄的干劲，鼓起了保证永远跃进的决心和信心。
