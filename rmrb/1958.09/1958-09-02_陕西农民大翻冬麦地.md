　　Shaanxi Farmers Intensively Deep-Plowing Winter Wheat Fields

　　(Report from our newspaper) Various regions in Shaanxi province are actively adopting various measures to ensure that all 26 million mu of wheat fields are deep-plowed once this year. As of now, the province has deep-plowed over 9 million mu of land. These deep-plowed lands generally reach a depth of about one chi (approximately 1/3 meter), with high-yield "satellite" fields reaching a depth of three to five chi.

　　In order to overcome the difficulties of labor and animal power, various counties have successively established deep-plowing professional teams, adopting the method of "changing people and shifts without changing hoes" to rationally arrange labor. Many agricultural cooperatives in counties such as Hu, Zhouzhi, and Hanyang have divided the professional teams into two or three shifts, working day and night in a concentrated effort. In order to adjust labor, Baoji and Weinan counties are cooperating with each other between townships, cooperatives, plains, and highlands.

　　Judging from the current progress, the deep-plowing movement in Shaanxi Province is still uneven. Some regions do not fully recognize the importance of deep-plowing, emphasizing labor shortages and being too busy to handle it. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently proposed that 26 million mu of wheat land must be guaranteed to be deep-plowed once; it can only exceed this amount, not decrease it. At present, party organizations at all levels are taking measures, according to the instructions of the provincial committee, to strengthen the leadership of deep-plowing.

### 陕西农民大翻冬麦地

　　陕西农民大翻冬麦地
    本报讯　陕西省各地积极采取各种措施，保证今年把两千六百万亩小麦田全部深翻一遍。到目前为止，陕西全省已深翻土地九百多万亩。这些深翻地一般都深达一尺左右，高额丰产“卫星”田深达三尺至五尺。
    为了克服劳畜力困难，各县先后成立了翻地专业队，采取换人换班不换锨的办法，合理地安排了劳力。鄠县、盩厔、郃阳等县的很多农业社，把专业队分成两班或三班，日夜突击。宝鸡和渭南县为了调剂劳力，乡与乡、社与社、平川与高原之间，互相进行协作。
    从目前的进展情况来看，陕西省深翻地运动的进度还不平衡，有些地区对深翻地的重要性认识不足，强调劳力紧张，忙不过来。中共陕西省委最近提出，二千六百万亩麦地必须保证深翻一遍，只能超过不能减少。目前，各级党组织根据省委的指示，正采取措施，加强对深翻地的领导工作。
