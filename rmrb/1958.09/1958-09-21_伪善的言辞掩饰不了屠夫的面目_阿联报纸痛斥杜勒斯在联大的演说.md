Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 19th - Many newspapers here today published editorials condemning Dulles' speech at the United Nations General Assembly.

"Al-Sahafa" said that Dulles did not mention the real causes of the Taiwan Strait crisis, which are: these islands are an inseparable part of China, but they are used by imperialism to threaten the Chinese mainland.

The newspaper also said, "Dulles did not mention the atomic missiles, the Seventh Fleet, and the huge military power that the United States has concentrated in this region, which have become the root cause of anxiety for world peace. He even ignored the right of 600 million Chinese people to have a seat in the United Nations."

The newspaper said that Dulles' speech shows that the United States still implements outdated imperialist policies to this day, opposing the people's right to fight for sovereignty, freedom, and survival. He also proved to us that the United States will never give up its policy of ruling by force and exploiting by threats, and will insist on protecting its agents all over the world, so that the United States can bring those who have been kicked away by the people into its embrace, making one person the president of the General Assembly and another the "president" of Taiwan.

"Al-Yaum" said that Dulles' speech "is to dye the American fist with henna in order to cover up the blood stains on it, the blood of weak nations."

The newspaper refuted Dulles' claim that atrocities occurred elsewhere, and reminded Dulles of the massacres of black people by white Americans. The newspaper ended with a poem: "We suffer from a prince who mentions God and sings praises to him, he slaughters us like a butcher, but he always mentions God before carrying out the slaughter."

"Al-Jamahir" pointed out that Dulles' speech cannot hide the attempts and conspiracies of US imperialism. It warned the Arabs to be vigilant against the dirty conspiracies of the imperialists.

"Al-Nour" believes that Dulles' speech shows that the United States will insist on implementing deceptive and hypocritical policies.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 19th - "Al-Shaab" today condemned Dulles' demand in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly for the establishment of "international forces" in the Middle East and the cessation of so-called "inflammatory broadcasts in the Middle East." The newspaper pointed out that these were not included in the Arab proposals unanimously adopted by the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.

It is worth noting that Dulles made these remarks a few days before the fall of Shamun, the American lackey. "Al-Shaab" said that this is an attempt to create difficulties and also deliberately to imply the American view: it is not appropriate to withdraw all the troops stationed in Lebanon now.

"Al-Akhbar" said that Dulles' speech shows that he is still determined to create unrest and instability in the region. Obviously, the purpose of the American policy is to buy time and use conspiracies to conquer new territories.

"Al-Akhbar" said: The resolutions passed by the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly are gradually becoming a dead letter. It is obvious that the West has not changed its traditional tactics. It seems that if it wants to go out the door, it must be planning to jump back in through the window.

The newspaper said that the only result of Dulles' new strategy will be to convince the Arabs that the wisest policy they should adopt towards the West should be complete distrust.

### 伪善的言辞掩饰不了屠夫的面目  阿联报纸痛斥杜勒斯在联大的演说

    伪善的言辞掩饰不了屠夫的面目
    阿联报纸痛斥杜勒斯在联大的演说
    新华社大马士革19日电　此间许多报纸今天都发表社论，对杜勒斯在联合国大会的发言提出谴责。
    “沙牧国报”说，杜勒斯没有提到台湾海峡危机产生的真正原因，这些原因就是：这些岛屿是中国不可分割的一部分，但是它们被帝国主义用来威胁中国本土。
    这家报纸又说，“杜勒斯没有提到原子导弹、第七舰队以及美国在这个地区所集中的巨大军力，这些已经成为世界和平焦虑的根源。他甚至无视了六亿中国人民在联合国拥有席位的权利。”
    这家报纸说，杜勒斯的发言表明，美国到今天为止仍然执行已经过时的帝国主义政策，反对人民争取主权、自由和生存的权利。他还向我们证明，美国决不放弃用武力进行统治以及用威胁进行剥削的政策，还要坚持保护它在世界各地的代理人，以便美国能够把被人民一脚踢开的那些人拉入它的怀抱，使一个人成为联大主席，使另一个人成为台湾的“总统”。
    “今天报”说，杜勒斯的演说“是用指甲花染美国的拳头，以便掩盖上面的血迹，这些血是弱小民族的鲜血。”
    这家报纸驳斥了杜勒斯所谓在其他地方发生暴行的说法，它提醒杜勒斯注意美国白种人对黑人的屠杀。这家报纸以一首诗结尾：“我们为王子所苦，他提到真主并且对他讴歌，他像一个屠夫一样地屠杀我们，但是他在进行屠杀之前总要先提一声真主。”
    “群众报”指出，杜勒斯的演说掩饰不了美帝国主义的企图和阴谋。它警告阿拉伯人对帝国主义者的肮脏阴谋保持警惕。
    “光明报”认为杜勒斯的演说表明，美国要坚持执行迷惑人的和伪善的政策。
    新华社开罗19日电“人民报”今天谴责杜勒斯在他在联合国大会发表的演说中要求在中东建立“国际部队”和制止所谓“中东的煽动性广播”。这家报纸指出，这些都是联合国大会紧急会议全体一致通过的阿拉伯提案所没有的东西。
    值得注意的是，杜勒斯在美国的走狗夏蒙就要下台的前几天说这番话。“人民报”说，这是企图制造困难，也是有意要暗示美国的这种观点：现在不宜把驻在黎巴嫩的军队全部撤走。
    “消息报”说，杜勒斯的演说表明，他仍然决心要在这个地区制造不安和不稳定。显然，美国政策的目的在于争取时间，利用阴谋手段来征服新的领土。
    “消息报”说：联合国大会紧急会议通过的决议正在逐渐变成一纸具文，很明显，西方没有改变它的传统的策略，看来，如果它要从门口走出去的话，它必定是打算从窗口跳回来。
    这家报纸说，杜勒斯的新策略所产生的唯一结果将是使阿拉伯人相信，他们对西方所采取的最明智的政策应当是完全的不信任。
