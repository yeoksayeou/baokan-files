Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Electric: Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant has improved a steelmaking open-hearth furnace, enabling a 38-ton steelmaking open-hearth furnace to produce 80 tons of steel, more than doubling the output. It is estimated that by the end of the year, this open-hearth furnace can increase the country's steel production by 10,000 to 13,000 tons.

The workers of Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, in order to fully guarantee the great development of the iron and steel industry and manufacture more metallurgical equipment, are constantly tapping production potential from all aspects. Steelmaking is the first process in this factory's manufacturing of metallurgical equipment. Wu Xibin, a steelmaking worker and Communist Party member in the steelmaking workshop, and Shi Jiafu, a technician in the workshop, with the cooperation of the equipment section's engineer, proposed improving the existing open-hearth furnace to fully utilize its potential. They advocated that the 38-ton open-hearth furnace should produce 80 tons of steel. This suggestion was immediately supported by the workshop's Party branch and leading comrades, and two branch committee meetings were held to discuss it, and a technical research group was established. During the discussion, many people had various concerns, worrying that they would "try to draw a tiger and end up with a dog." However, many engineering and technical personnel and workers, encouraged and supported by the Party organization, studied the structure of the open-hearth furnace from various aspects and conducted scientific calculations, finding sufficient scientific basis for expanding the furnace hearth.

In the process of modifying the open-hearth furnace, the enthusiasm of the workers was high. Workers on vacation volunteered to work at the factory; night shift workers continued to work after their shifts ended; workshop cadres and technicians also joined the battle. Everyone increased the level of the furnace door sill, the furnace roof, and the spray outlet water jacket by 200 millimeters each.

Finally, with everyone's efforts, this open-hearth furnace was put into production one day ahead of schedule. After several days of trial smelting, the production situation is very normal, and the quality is also very good.

　　改进炼钢炉　产量加一倍
    沈阳重机厂一座三十八吨平炉出钢八十吨
    新华社沈阳电　沈阳重型机器厂改进了一座炼钢平炉，使三十八吨的炼钢平炉炼出了八十吨钢，产量提高一倍多。预算到年底，这座平炉可为国家增产一万至一万三千吨钢。
    沈阳重型机器厂职工为了充分保证钢铁工业大发展，更多的制造冶金设备，正在不断从各方面挖掘生产潜力。炼钢，是这个工厂制造冶金设备的第一道工序，炼钢车间炼钢工人、共产党员吴希宾和车间技术员史家富在设备科工程师的配合下，提出了改进现有平炉，充分发挥平炉潜力的建议，他们主张让三十八吨平炉炼八十吨钢。这个建议立即得到车间党支部和领导同志的支持，两次召开了支委大会进行讨论，并成立了技术研究小组。在讨论中，不少人有种种顾虑，耽心“画虎不成反类犬”。但是，许多工程技术人员和工人在党组织的鼓舞和支持下，多方面研究了平炉的结构，并进行了科学计算，找出了扩大炉膛的充分科学根据。
    在改装平炉过程中，职工们热情高涨，休班的工人纷纷到工厂献工；夜班工人下了班，还继续工作；车间干部和技职人员也都投入了这场战斗。大家把平炉的炉门坎水平、炉顶、喷出口水套各增高了二百公厘。
    这座平炉终于在大家的努力下，按计划提前一天投入了生产。经过几天来的试炼，生产情况很正常，质量也很好。
