    In the City of Seven Nos - Shashi
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Wei

    Unforgettable Impressions
    Shashi, Hubei Province, is located next to the Yangtze River. The terrain is low, the population is dense, there is a lot of water accumulation in the urban area, and the sanitary conditions are very poor. However, the excellent sanitation work here and people's conscious hygiene habits have left a deep impression.
    One day in late August, I went to the Shashi Municipal Party Committee for an interview. Comrade Xiao Zhong led me to the office. When I got to the office door, I suddenly saw a row of shoes blocking the entrance. I was stunned, and Comrade Xiao Zhong said, "You're not used to taking off your shoes indoors, are you?" I quickly said, "I am, I am," and quickly took off my shoes and went inside. But I was thinking, "This is the first time I've ever taken off my shoes indoors!" People who come to Shashi say this is a strange phenomenon. In fact, the people of Shashi no longer regard it as a strange thing. In many offices, schools, and households, people take off their shoes before entering (or put on clean slippers) as a good hygiene habit.
    The toilets here are not the convenient and clean flush toilets that we see in big cities, but are built with wooden boards over large dung pits or manure vats. Even in such toilets, people who came to Shashi have personally seen that there are no maggots and no flies. Once, I saw another strange phenomenon in several households in Xiaozixiang: in a small toilet built with wooden boards of less than one square meter (shared by many families), there was a small earthen pot (some were small iron boxes). This was a spittoon. A pair of clean wooden slippers were placed at the door of the toilet for people to wear so as not to dirty the toilet floor. A basin of water was placed outside the door for people to wash their hands after using the toilet. A duty roster was hung on the door, and the person in charge was responsible for cleaning and scrubbing the toilet, changing the hand washing water, and getting stove ash for people to use after using the toilet. The toilet supervisor handed over and took over every day. In these ordinary households, in such simple toilets, people consciously put up such sanitary facilities. Isn't it rare? But this is not considered rare in Shashi. This is also a conscious hygiene habit of the people of Shashi!
    The Power of Big-Character Posters
    Shashi launched the movement to eliminate the "Seven Pests" and promote hygiene, using more than a dozen forms of mobilizing the masses, such as oath-taking rallies, parades, street propaganda, big debates, big-character posters, on-site meetings, visits and comparisons, exhibitions, and lantern slides. However, the most effective was the big-character poster. For example, the Hui Nationality Weaving Factory (with more than 100 employees) was not active in the movement to eliminate the "Seven Pests". When residents came to inspect, they found maggots and flies in the toilet and posted several big-character posters hoping that they would correct this. The factory did not take this to heart, and casually pulled a few workers to clean it up. Some workers even made strange remarks about the residents. The residents came to inspect a second time and found that the factory's sanitary conditions had not improved. So they posted 214 big-character posters all at once, including clapper rhymes, doggerel, poems, and cartoons. The posters were all over the factory, even on the handcarts outside the door. The criticism was directed at the young female factory director, Liu Demao, who was a Party member and a people's representative. One of the big-character posters read: "Liu Demao, you are so confused, you are so-so about eliminating the Seven Pests. You are a people's representative, why don't you seek happiness for the masses?" The title was: "We want your reply." After these 200-plus big-character posters were posted, Liu Demao quickly organized a factory-wide debate. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to accept the criticism of the masses and thoroughly eliminate the Seven Pests. Factory Director Liu first posted her letter of determination, which read, "The big-character posters posted by the comrades of the street section are all treasures. I am determined to change and no longer emphasize the objective." Immediately afterwards, more than 100 workers in the factory posted 110 big-character posters, each expressing their determination to the masses. They worked hard overnight and changed the environmental hygiene. The residents came to inspect for the third time and found that they had achieved "Seven Nos" and "Six Lights" (top, bottom, left, right, front, and back). They went back and posted big-character posters praising them. The municipal headquarters for eliminating the "Seven Pests" immediately held an on-site meeting in the factory to affirm the great role of big-character posters. As a result, the power of the big-character posters resounded throughout the city, and all units and streets universally used big-character posters to promote their work. Each hygiene inspection team carried a backpack with them, containing pens, ink, and paper. When inspecting hygiene in each household, they wrote big-character posters at any time, with both praise and criticism, posting dozens or hundreds of posters at a time, in various and lively forms. The city posted no less than 100,000 big-character posters just to promote the movement to eliminate the "Seven Pests".
    Liaozi River, Past and Present
    Liaozi River used to be a desolate suburb of Shashi. It was bordered by a dike on one side and ponds on three sides, with land occupying less than one-third of the total area. It was full of weeds and smelly ponds, and no pedestrians were seen all day long. Before liberation, people described this place as: "Abandoning men and women in Liaozi River, corpses in smelly ponds and many weeds, poisonous snakes, poisonous insects, and mosquito nests, a scene of desolation is really hard to describe." In 1952, some residents on the dike moved to Liaozi River. The government led them to dig up corpses, shovel weeds, and build simple and tidy thatched sheds and tile houses. But the number of mosquitoes, flies, and rats here was probably the highest in Shashi. Everyone living in Liaozi River was bitten by mosquitoes and insects all over their bodies. Before dark, every household was busy using artemisia to smoke mosquitoes, and people quickly crawled into tents to avoid mosquitoes. The artemisia smoke made people unable to sleep, and the mosquitoes could not be killed or smoked away.
    This spring, as soon as the city mobilized to eliminate the "Seven Pests," the 118 residents of Liaozi River immediately launched a debate, recalled the harms of the "Seven Pests," and were determined to launch a fierce attack on the "Seven Pests." They were divided into four combat groups and carried out three major offensives, filling in six large and small sewage ponds, dredging seven sewage ditches, and ensuring that every pig had a pigsty and every toilet had a manure cover. They comprehensively encircled and annihilated sparrows and rats. They gave the furniture in their houses a thorough cleaning and achieved "Six Lights". After fifteen days of fighting, Liaozi River basically eliminated the "Seven Pests".
    Now, Liaozi River has become a beautiful place. Rows of bamboo mat houses have been plastered with mud and lime, making them white and beautiful. The smelly ponds here have been filled in and transformed into a clear fish pond at the end of the houses. A patch of weeds has been turned into neat vegetable gardens, and many lush trees stand around the vegetable gardens and fish ponds. Every household has put away their mosquito nets. The five small streets and 84 houses here have all been cleaned and tidied up. Even the pigsties have been swept clean. The residents of Liaozi River are also preparing to build a beautiful garden next to the fish pond this year.
    Everyone in Liaozi River is smiling. People sing the praises of Liaozi River: "Now go to see Liaozi River, there are many people coming and going, you also come to say and I also say, everyone praises the happy nest."

    在七无城——沙市

    难忘的印象
    湖北沙市，紧临长江，地势低，人口密，市区积水很多，卫生条件很差。可是，这里的出色的卫生工作，人们自觉的卫生习惯，却给人留下了深刻的印象。
    8月底的一天，我到沙市市委采访，小钟同志领我到办公室去。走到办公室门口，突然看见一排鞋子拦住了门。我正在发楞，小钟同志说：“你脱鞋进屋不习惯吧？”我连忙说：“习惯，习惯，”赶快脱掉鞋子，进屋去了，心里却在想：“脱鞋进屋还是生平第一次呢！”到沙市来的人，都说这是一种奇怪的现象，其实，沙市人民已不把它当成奇怪的事情，在许多机关、学校、住家户，人们都把脱鞋进屋（或套上干净的拖鞋进屋）当作一种良好的卫生习惯。
    这里的厕所，没有一个是我们在大城市看到的那种方便而洁净的抽水马桶，而是在大粪坑或粪缸上用木板架起来的。就是在这样的厕所里，到沙市的人都亲眼看到没有蛆，没有苍蝇。有一次我在孝子巷好几家都看到了另一种奇怪现象：在不到一平方公尺大的木板搭起来的小厕所里（许多家人合用的），放着一个个土磁小盆（有的是小铁盒子），这是痰盂；进厕所的门框边放着一对干净的木拖板鞋，这是让进厕所的人穿的，免得弄脏了厕所的地板；门外放着一盆水，让人们便后洗手；门上挂着一个值日牌，负责人的职责是打扫刷洗厕所，换洗手水和弄炉灶灰，让人们便后撒用。厕所负责人每天交班接班。在这种普普通通的住家户，又是这样简陋的厕所里，人们竟自觉地搞起了这样的卫生设置，难道不稀奇吗？但，这在沙市并不算稀奇，这也是沙市人民自觉的卫生习惯哪！
    大字报的威力
    沙市开展除七害讲卫生的运动，运用了誓师大会、游行示威、街头宣传、大辩论、大字报、现场会、参观评比、展览会、幻灯等十几种发动群众的形式；但是，最起作用的是大字报。例如回民织布厂（有一百多职工），在除七害运动中行动不积极，居民来检查时，发现厕所里有蛆有苍蝇，便给他们贴了几张大字报，希望他们改正。厂里没有把这放在心上，随便拉几个工人打扫一下，有些工人还说居民的怪话。居民第二次又来检查，发现厂里的卫生情况没有转变，于是一下子给他们贴了二百一十四张大字报，有快板、有顺口溜、有诗、有漫画，厂子的里里外外都贴满了，连门外的板车上贴的都是。批评的矛头针对着年轻的女厂长刘德茂，她是党员，又是人民代表；其中有一张大字报是：“刘德茂，你真糊涂，除七害你是马马虎虎，你是人民代表，为什么不给群众谋幸福？”标题是：“要你答复”。这二百多张大字报贴出之后，刘德茂连忙组织全厂辩论，大家一致表示决心，要接受群众批评，把除七害搞彻底。刘厂长首先把自己的决心书贴出去，大字报写的是“街段同志贴我的大字报，张张大字报都是宝，我决心改掉，再不把客观强调。”紧接着，全厂一百多工人，贴出了一百一十张大字报，个个向群众表决心。他们连夜苦战，改变了环境卫生。居民第三次来检查了，发现他们做到“七无”和（上、下、左、右、前、后）六光，回去就贴出大字报表扬了他们。市里除七害总指挥部马上在这个厂召开现场会，肯定大字报的巨大作用。这一来，大字报的威力，响彻了全市，各单位各街道普遍运用了大字报推动工作。每个卫生检查组一出去检查，随身就挂上背包，里边装着笔墨纸张，在各家各户检查卫生时，随时写大字报，有表扬有批评，一贴就是几十张，几百张，形式多样而生动活泼。全市光为了推动除七害运动，贴的大字报就不下十万张。
    廖子河今昔
    廖子河原是沙市一个荒郊。它一面靠堤，三面靠塘，陆地占不到整个面积的三分之一。这里满目野草，臭塘熏人，整天看不到行人。解放前人们形容这个地方是：“抛男弃女廖子河，尸骨臭塘野草多，毒蛇、毒虫、蚊子窝，一片凄凉真难说。”1952年，堤上有一部分居民移居廖子河，政府领导他们在这里挖尸骨，铲野草，新建了简单而整齐的草棚和瓦屋。但是这里的蚊子、苍蝇、老鼠之多，在沙市可说是第一。住在廖子河的人，个个被蚊虫咬的遍身是疮。不到天黑，家家户户忙着用艾熏蚊子，人赶快钻到帐子里躲蚊子，艾烟把人熏得不能睡觉，蚊子也熏不死、熏不完。
    今年春天，市里一动员除七害，廖子河的一百一十八户居民，立即展开了辩论，回忆了七害的危害，下定决心向七害展开猛攻。他们分成四个战斗小组，进行了三次大突击，填平大小六个污水塘，疏通七条污水沟，还做到了家家猪子有猪圈，个个厕所有粪盖。全面围歼了麻雀和老鼠。屋里家具大洗澡，作到了六光。经过十五天的战斗，廖子河基本消灭了七害。
    现在，廖子河变成了一个美丽的地方，一排排的竹席房屋都用泥巴和石灰糊抹了一遍，洁白好看。这里的臭水塘都填平了，在房屋尽头改造成一个清澈的养鱼塘，一片野草的地方，变成了一块块整齐的菜园，在菜园和鱼塘周围耸立着许多绿油油的树木。家家户户收起了蚊帐。这里的五条小街，八十四栋房屋，家家做到了清洁无尘又整齐美观。他们连猪圈都打扫得一尘不染。廖子河的居民还准备今年内，在养鱼塘旁边建起一座美丽的花园。
    廖子河人人喜笑颜开。人们歌颂廖子河说：“如今去看廖子河，来来往往人很多，你亦云来我亦说，人人称赞幸福窝。”
