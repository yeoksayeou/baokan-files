    Combine the "Eliminate the Four Pests" Campaign, Vigorously Purchase Waste Products, and Beautify Homes

    In March of this year, under the unified leadership of the County Party Committee, Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, established a Waste Utilization Committee. It put forward the slogan "Waste Utilization, Beautify Homes" and formulated specific measures to achieve this slogan. This provided a new way to expand the purchase and full utilization of waste products, creating new experiences. The on-site meeting on finance and trade work held by the Finance and Trade Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in Xinhui and the on-site meeting on waste product purchasing and utilization held by the Ministry of Commerce in Wuqi County, Hebei Province in May both promoted this experience. Over the past few months, this experience has been gradually promoted in more than twenty provinces and cities, and new developments have been made in specific practices. We believe that this practice of purchasing waste products and beautifying homes is fully adapted to the requirements of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. It embodies the demands of the broad masses of people and is a concrete manifestation of socialist commerce serving the people. Therefore, it has quickly gained the support and endorsement of urban and rural people and is worthy of learning and promotion throughout the country.

    What is the significance and purpose of vigorously promoting home beautification? Article 30 of the National Agricultural Development Program (Second Revised Draft, same below) points out: "With the development of cooperative production and the increase in the income of cooperative members, agricultural cooperatives should, according to needs and possibilities, encourage and assist members to repair and build new family homes in a planned and phased manner, under the principles of voluntariness, mutual assistance, saving expenses, and saving land, to improve the living conditions of cooperative members. Before launching this work, each county and urban suburb should first conduct pilot projects. In accordance with the principles of suitability, hygiene, safety, economy, and beauty, propose a village layout plan and standard designs for residential buildings, and then promote them in stages." Article 31 further points out: "Starting from 1956, within twelve years, eliminate rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes in all possible places." These are major issues in building socialism and changing customs. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of the whole country have seen unprecedented development in production and greatly improved lives. They also have more urgent demands for improving environmental sanitation and living conditions. For the sake of greater production development in the future, good living environments and living conditions are even more necessary. We believe that purchasing waste products and beautifying homes can be carried out from indoors to outdoors, from courtyards to streets, from doors and windows to cabinets and wardrobes. This is in line with the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Program and is an important means to achieve the elimination of the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, and improve living conditions.

    Is this kind of "beautifying homes" a form of extravagance and waste that is contrary to the principle of diligence and thrift? No. According to the experience of Xinhui and other regions, they sell waste products in exchange for materials as renovation expenses. Generally, there is money left over after selling waste products and carrying out renovations. More importantly, the funds needed by the masses to beautify their homes are paid for with waste copper, scrap iron, rags, broken shoes, rotten socks, and idle items. If these items, such as waste copper and scrap iron, are urgently needed industrial raw materials for the country, allowing them to remain idle and discarded will not only harbor dirt and create unsanitary conditions, but will inevitably lead to their dispersal and loss over time, causing great waste. By using "beautifying homes" as a way to pay wages and collect all these materials, turning useless into useful, and making the most of everything, the virtues of diligence, thrift, and cherishing materials of the Chinese people are further promoted.

    Purchasing waste products and "beautifying homes" is not only reflected in diligence, thrift, and cherishing materials, but also plays an active role in building the country diligently and thriftily, supporting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, especially overcoming the shortage of certain industrial raw materials. According to the statistical analysis of commercial departments over the years, more than 80% of the purchased waste products are the necessary raw materials for industry and handicrafts. We know that copper is an urgently needed material in industrial construction, and a corresponding amount of copper is necessary in the great leap forward in steel production. Doing everything possible to increase the production and purchase of copper is an extremely important task at present. Many regions have collected copper utensils and copper accessories from organs, groups, schools, troops, and cadre dormitories after installing suitable substitutes. This is a very good practice. Among the vast urban and rural residents, it is also worth advocating to voluntarily remove various copper accessories to support socialist construction and pay for the expenses needed to beautify homes based on the voluntary basis of the masses, and actively supply beautiful and suitable substitutes and be responsible for installing and decorating them for residents. This approach not only does not affect the use of organs and the masses, but also collects a large amount of scrap copper, supporting the urgent needs of industry. In the future, this practice should be vigorously promoted in conjunction with the "Eliminate the Four Pests" campaign and the work of beautifying homes.

    What methods should be used to carry out the work of purchasing waste products and "beautifying homes"? The experience of Xinhui and other places proves that it must be carried out smoothly under the unified leadership of the Party committee, following the mass line, opposing coercion and commandism, and focusing on the central tasks of each period. "Beautifying Homes" is a new task. In order to turn this work into a mass movement, it is necessary to do a good job of publicity in depth, repeatedly explaining the political and economic significance of this work to the broad masses of people. The practice of Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, is: under the unified leadership of the County Party Committee, first do a good job of beautifying one village and hold on-site meetings in various townships; after that, each township will do a good job of piloting one village, and then hold on-site meetings separately, blooming in an all-round way. Within twenty days, the entire county's 110,000 households basically achieved: "Every village is clean and tidy, every household is beautiful, there is no abandoned object on the ground, there is no waste product in the house, there are no miscellaneous bones outside the village, and there are no poultry feathers in the village", becoming a clean county with eight absences. This experience is worth learning from everywhere. How to consolidate after beautification? Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, has set up "treasure boxes" in the already beautified courtyards, so that residents can put waste products and waste materials generated in life and production into the boxes, and purchasers regularly patrol and purchase them. This practice is also worth emulating everywhere. Although the work of purchasing waste products and "beautifying homes" is arduous and meticulous, as long as we constantly summarize it in the process of work, constantly enrich the existing experience, and improve the way and method of work, this work can be quickly carried out.

    At present, many regions across the country have carried out this work and achieved great results. However, some comrades have some incorrect ideas that have not yet been clarified, which hinder the comprehensive development of this work. For example, some people think: "Xinhui is in the south, the climate is suitable, the economic conditions are good, and the people's lives are prosperous, so there is a demand for beautification, but this is not possible here." May I ask: The experience of Xinhui can be realized in Shaanxi, Shanxi, and even Baiquan County in Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost part of China. What is the difference between regions and living conditions? Some people say: "Beautifying homes is not suitable for cities, especially big cities." This statement is also unfounded. On the contrary, big cities are far superior to rural areas and county towns in terms of the potential quantity of discarded materials and technical strength, and "beautifying homes" is easier to promote. As long as we are good at organizing, cooperating with all parties, relying on the masses, and supporting each other, the work can be done well. Some people also say: "The work of beautifying homes is both costly and troublesome, so it is easier to simply purchase waste products." This statement does not understand the great political and economic significance of "beautifying homes" by purchasing waste products, nor does it understand that this practice is a new direction and new development in the work of purchasing waste products.

    In order to launch a mass movement that combines eliminating the four pests, purchasing waste products, and beautifying homes, these erroneous ideas must be criticized.

    Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee, the patriotic health campaign centered on the elimination of the four pests has deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and has achieved great results. However, rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, and flies breed very quickly. If we relax a little, they will multiply again. Through the movement of eliminating the four pests and beautifying homes, it has a significant effect on eliminating the breeding of the four pests, and it is also an effective measure to implement the call of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao to carry out the elimination of the four pests and pay attention to hygiene. In this autumn and winter and next spring, we must combine the central tasks such as vigorously developing people's communes, deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation, and water conservancy construction, as well as occasions such as National Day, New Year's Day, and Spring Festival. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and in a led, organized, prepared and batch manner, launch a mass movement of purchasing waste products and beautifying homes throughout the country to support the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    National Day is approaching. Before National Day, we are required to cooperate with the nationwide large-scale movement of eliminating the four pests, learn from the experience of Xinhui and Chang'an in purchasing waste products and beautifying homes, actively take action, eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, clean up thoroughly, and welcome the great National Day holiday.

### 结合除四害运动，大力收购废品、美化家庭

    结合除四害运动，大力收购废品、美化家庭
    广东省新会县于今年3月间在县委统一领导下成立了废物利用委员会，提出了“废物利用，美化家庭”的号召，并制定了实现这一号召的具体办法，使废品的扩大收购和充分利用找到了新的途径，创造了新的经验。中共中央财贸部在新会召开的财贸工作现场会议和商业部5月份在河北无极县召开的废品收购利用的现场会议上，都推广了这一经验。几个月来，这一经验已在二十多个省市逐步推广，在具体做法上也有了新的发展。我们认为这种收购废品美化家庭的做法是完全适应于工农业生产大跃进所要求的，它体现了广大群众的要求，也是社会主义商业为人民服务的一种具体表现，因之很快的得到了城乡人民的支持和拥护，是值得全国各地学习和推广的。
    我们大搞美化家庭的意义和目的何在呢？全国农业发展纲要（第二次修正草案，下同）第三十条已经指出：“随着合作社生产的发展和社员收入的增加，农业合作社应当根据需要和可能，鼓励和协助社员，在自愿、互助、节约开支和节约用地的原则下，有准备地、有计划地、分期分批地修缮和新建家庭住宅，改善社员的居住条件。开展这项工作以前，各县和城市郊区，应当先进行试点。按照适用、卫生、安全、经济、美观的原则，拟出村落布局的方案和住宅建筑的标准设计，然后分期分批推广”。三十一条又指出：“从1956年起，在十二年内，在一切可能的地方，基本上消灭老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇和蚊子”。这些都是建设社会主义和移风易俗的重大问题。全国人民在共产党的领导下，生产空前发展，生活大大改善，他们对改善环境卫生、改善居住条件也有着较为迫切的要求。为了今后生产的更加发展，也就更需要有良好的生活环境和居住条件。我们认为收购废品、美化家庭可以从室内到室外，从庭院到街道，从门窗户壁到仓橱衣柜都进行整修和美化，正是符合于农业发展纲要的精神的，也正是实现除四害讲卫生，改善居住条件的一个重要手段。
    这种“美化家庭”是不是一种铺张浪费并与勤俭持家的原则相违背呢？不是的。根据新会和其他地区的经验来看，他们是出售废品后以物代酬，作为修缮费用的，一般是在出售废品进行修缮后还有余钱。更重要的是群众美化家庭所需要的费用，都是用废铜、烂铁、破布、坏鞋、烂袜子以及呆置无用的物品折款支付的。这些物品如废铜、烂铁是国家迫切需要的工业原材料，任其呆置抛弃，不仅藏垢纳污有碍卫生，旷日弥久必然流散丢失造成很大浪费。通过“美化家庭”以支付工资的形式将这些物资全部收购起来，变无用为有用，使物尽其用，就更进一步的发扬了我国人民勤俭持家、惜物致用的美德。
    收购废品“美化家庭”不仅是体现在勤俭持家惜物致用方面，并且对勤俭建国、支援工农业生产大跃进，特别是克服某些工业原材料的不足，也起着积极的作用。根据商业部门历年来的统计分析，收购的废品中有80％以上是工业和手工业必需的原材料。我们知道，铜是工业建设中迫切需要的物资，在钢铁生产的大跃进中，还必须要有相应数量的铜。千方百计地增加铜的生产和收购，是当前极为重要的任务。不少地区对机关、团体、学校、部队、干部宿舍中的铜制器皿和铜制附件，以适合的代用品为其安装后进行收购。这种作法是很好的。在广大城乡居民中，通过收购废品美化家庭的工作，在群众自愿基础上，自动摘除各种铜制附件以支援社会主义建设和支付美化家庭所需费用时，也是值得提倡的，应该积极供应美观适用的代用品，并负责为居民安装整饰。这种办法，既不影响机关和群众的使用，同时又收购了大量杂铜，支援了工业的迫切需要，这种作法，今后应该结合除四害运动与美化家庭的工作大力加以推广。
    用什么方法开展收购废品、“美化家庭”的工作呢？新会等地的经验证明，必须是在党委统一领导下，走群众路线，反对强迫命令，围绕着各个时期的中心工作才能顺利地进行。“美化家庭”是个新的工作，为了使这一工作形成群众性的运动，就必须深入地作好宣传工作，向广大群众反复说明这项工作的政治和经济意义。陕西省长安县的作法是：由县委统一领导，首先做好一个村的美化工作，召开各乡的现场会议；之后，各乡又作好一个村的试点，再分头召开现场会议，全面开花。全县十一万户在二十天内即基本作到了：“村村整洁，家家美观，地无弃物，家无废品，村外无杂骨，村里无禽毛”，成为八无清洁县。这个经验是值得各地学习的。在美化之后，又如何巩固呢？黑龙江省拜泉县在已经美化的庭院中又设“聚宝箱”，让居民把生活与生产中所产生的废品、废料投入箱内，收购人员定期巡回收购。这种做法也是值得各地效法的。收购废品、“美化家庭”虽然是一项艰巨细致的工作，但只要我们在工作进行中随时加以总结，不断地丰富现有的经验，改进工作方式和方法，这项工作是完全可以很快的开展起来的。
    目前，全国已有不少地区开展了这一工作，并获得了很大成绩。但也有些同志有一些不正确的思想尚未澄清，因而还阻碍着这一工作的全面开展。譬如有人认为：“新会在南方，气候适宜，经济条件好，人民生活富裕，有美化的要求，而我们这里则不行”。试问：新会的经验可以在陕西、山西，甚至在中国最北部的黑龙江省拜泉县实现，还有什么地域和生活条件之分呢？有的人说：“美化家庭不适合于城市、特别是大城市”。这种说法也是毫无根据的。应该是恰恰相反，大城市无论在废弃物资的潜在量和技术力量等方面，都远较农村、县城条件优越，而“美化家庭”也更容易推广，只要善于组织，协作各方，依靠群众，互相支援，工作是完全可以做好的。还有人说：“美化家庭的工作既赔钱又麻烦，不如单纯收购废品省事”。这种说法是既不了解通过收购废品“美化家庭”重大的政治意义与经济意义，也不了解这种作法是收购废品工作的新方向新发展。
    为了开展结合一个除四害、收购废品、美化家庭的群众性的运动，必须批判这些错误思想。
    在中央的正确领导下，以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动已深入人心，并获得了很大成绩；但鼠、雀、蚊、蝇孳生很快，稍一放松，它又会繁殖起来，通过除四害、美化家庭运动，对消灭四害的孳生，有着重大的作用，也是贯彻中央和毛主席提出的开展除四害、讲卫生的号召的一项有效措施。在今年秋冬明年春季，必须结合大搞人民公社、深耕积肥、兴修水利等中心工作，以及国庆节、新年、春节等时机，在全国范围内，在党委统一领导下，发动群众，依靠群众，有领导、有组织、有准备并分批地掀起一个收购废品美化家庭的群众性运动，以支援工农业生产大跃进。
    国庆节将届，我们要求在国庆节以前配合全国普遍的大规模的除四害运动，学习新会、长安收购废品美化家庭的经验，积极地行动起来，消灭四害，讲求卫生，打扫得干干净净，迎接伟大的国庆节日。
