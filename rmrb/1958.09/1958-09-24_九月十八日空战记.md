    The South China Sea, white clouds everywhere, thunderous roars coming from above the clouds. Our heroic war eagles from a frontline air force unit, led by Shen Ke and Zhu Youcai, are patrolling the sacred skies of our motherland.
    Soon, the command post transmitted an order: "Eight enemy aircraft in the combat zone, be alert and search." So they cast their sharp gazes into the distance, closely searching for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit pilots, and swiftly ascended to an altitude of ten thousand meters, speeding like lightning towards the combat zone. Number three aircraft, Li Mantian, was the first to discover four enemy aircraft, stealthily creeping up from the rear and below. In addition, there were four more providing cover on the outside. He immediately reported the situation to the team leader. The air commander immediately issued a decisive battle order.
    A tense battle to annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit pilots began. Shen Ke saw two enemy aircraft heading towards the tail of a brother aircraft and immediately led Li Mantian and others to attack the enemy. The enemy aircraft were thrown into disarray, and two of them hastily fired a few shots before fleeing in panic. Han Yuyan saw the situation clearly and decisively directed his wingman to pursue head-on. Our number six aircraft met an enemy aircraft head-on, and the enemy aircraft was so frightened that it tried to escape outward. Han Yuyan quickly turned around and charged towards it. This fellow panicked and tried to escape upwards, but Han Yuyan gave it a burst of gunfire head-on. It was seen that fire blossoms were erupting from its body as it wobbled and fled towards Taiwan! At this time, another enemy aircraft attempting to escape was firmly "bitten" by Zhu Youcai. Seeing that the situation was bad, the bandit pilot vainly attempted to glide away, but as soon as he turned his head to the left, he was met with a barrage of gunfire from Zhu Youcai, scaring him out of his wits. He then tried to turn and flee towards Taiwan, but "easy to come, hard to go." Before he could see the way, Zhu Youcai fired again, the shells carrying angry flames, exploding on the enemy aircraft. The other enemy aircraft, which were "covering without protecting," had already fled without a trace in order to save their dog lives.
    Across thousands of miles of silver sky, our heroic war eagles pierced through the white clouds and returned victoriously.

    九月十八日空战记
    杨国纲　邹民华
    南海上空，白云密布，云上传来雷鸣般的巨响，我前线空军某部英勇的战鹰，在沈克、朱有财率领下，正在巡视着祖国神圣的天空。
    不久，指挥所传来了命令：“战区八架敌机，注意搜索。”于是他们把锐利的目光，投向远方，严密地搜索着蒋家飞贼，迅速飞上万米高空，风驰电掣地飞向战区。三号机李满田首先发现四架敌机，正偷偷地从后下方向我窜来，另外，还有四架在外边掩护，他马上把情况向带队长机做了报告。空中指挥员立即果断地下达了战斗命令。
    一场紧张的痛歼蒋家飞贼的战斗开始了。沈克看见两架敌机，向兄弟机尾部窜去，立即率领李满田等向敌攻击，敌机被冲乱了套，其中两架敌机慌乱地开了几炮就落荒而逃。韩玉砚看明了情况，果断地指挥僚机，迎头直追。我六号机和一架敌机打了个对头，敌机吓得向外逃跑时，韩玉砚神速地兜转过来，向它冲去，这家伙慌乱地抬头向上逃窜，韩玉砚当头给了它一顿炮火，只见它身上冒出朵朵火花，摇摇晃晃的向台湾方向逃去！这时候，企图逃跑的另一架敌机，被朱有财稳稳地“咬”住。那飞贼见势不妙，妄想下滑逃跑，那知刚刚向左转头，就遭到朱有财一阵当头炮，吓得魂飞魄散，又企图转弯向台湾方向逃窜，“来时容易去时难”，还未看明去路，朱有财又狠狠地开了火，炮弹带着愤怒的火光，在敌机身上爆炸了。另外几架“掩而不护”的敌机，为了保存他们的狗命，早已逃得无影无踪了。
    银空万里，我英勇的战鹰穿过白云，胜利返航。　（新华社）
