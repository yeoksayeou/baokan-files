　　If a Mad Dog Tries to Crawl In, Beat It to Death!
    Our Correspondent in Shanghai

    The people of Shanghai, who fought imperialism for more than a century and finally achieved victory, today once again responded with the most resolute attitude to the new war provocations of US imperialism. From dawn to late at night, from the city center to the suburbs, from the main streets to the back alleys, everywhere was crowded with demonstrating crowds, with more than 2.5 million people participating. This was an unprecedented anti-imperialist demonstration in Shanghai's history.

    Nanjing Road was roaring. In the dark days of the past, the people of Shanghai had waged heroic and bloody struggles against imperialism here. Today, the infuriated people gathered here into an iron torrent. The slogan "American troops get out of the Taiwan area" resounded throughout the entire road. The workers of Wing On Company, who have a long tradition of fighting imperialism, demonstrated until late last night and participated in the parade again today. Anger made them forget their fatigue.

    Shi Xiaomei, a 69-year-old "revolutionary mother" and a participant in the three armed uprisings of Shanghai workers, thought of the scene of the "May Thirtieth" Movement more than 30 years ago when she stepped onto Nanjing Road. At that time, how many imperialist police and military police were there to deal with our unarmed workers, but we were not afraid at all. Now that our country is so strong, US imperialism still dares to provoke us. It is simply a dream.

    In today's marching ranks, there was also Zhou Fengying, an elderly female worker from Shenxin No. 9 Factory who participated in the "February 2nd" strike struggle in 1948, which shocked the country and abroad. When she learned that US imperialism was carrying out war intimidation against our country, she was so angry that she could not even speak. She said, "If a mad dog tries to crawl in, we will beat it to death!"

    The Bund at the end of Nanjing Road was also densely packed with angry crowds. Wang Defu, a motorboat crew member who has been working on the Huangpu River for 30 years, could not suppress the anger in his heart. Although he worked all night last night, he came to the Huangpu River again today. He said that we have not completely settled the old debts with US imperialism, but it dares to provoke us again. But what kind of China is China now!

    More than 100,000 residents of the Zhabei residential area, which was turned into a wasteland in the flames of imperialist aggression 21 years ago, today marched forward with red flags held high on the newly built wide road with a street garden. The team passed in front of rows of four-story red residential buildings newly built from the ruins.

      "When the motherland needs us, we will immediately take up guns...", in the student dining hall of Fudan University, there were bursts of passionate and majestic singing, which was the chorus of the third-year students of the Mathematics Department. They could not restrain the anger in their hearts and expressed their protest with exciting singing. Early in the morning, protest rallies were constantly held in the dormitories of students in various classes. The students of Class 2, Grade 2 of the Mathematics Department refuted Dulles' shameless statement point by point.

    Early this morning, Caoyang New Village - the first workers' residential area built after the liberation of Shanghai - was boiling. The offices of the residents' committee were crowded with people, some grinding ink, some cutting paper, preparing flags, slogans and cartoons for the afternoon parade. In order to participate in the parade, the women had already arranged their housework. The mother-in-law told her daughter-in-law, and the daughter told her mother, "Buy less groceries, clean up early and go to the parade." Retired female worker Yao Shiyun had just returned from the hospital after being ill. Her daughter-in-law persuaded her to stay at home to take care of the children, but she refused. As a result, the two of them had to take the children to participate in the parade.

    After the parade, the people who are vigorously engaged in the cultural revolution immediately threw themselves into the upsurge of literary and artistic creation. In just two hours, they wrote five poems and clappers such as "US imperialism is too rampant" and "Dare to play tricks on the Chinese coast"... Today, Guangci Hospital was not as quiet as usual. The loudspeakers in each ward repeatedly broadcast Premier Zhou's statement. The patients could not suppress the anger in their hearts and held rallies in the wards. The famous steel fighter Qiu Caikang asked the doctor to further accelerate the treatment so that he could strive to be discharged from the hospital early, return to his job, and make more steel to support the liberation of Taiwan.

    The workers of the city's factories worked hard during work hours and held various protest rallies after work, determined to fight the American aggressors to the end. (September 7)

　　疯狗想钻进来，就打死它！
    本报驻上海记者
    和帝国主义较量了一百多年，最后取得了胜利的上海人民，今天又一次以最坚决的态度回击美帝国主义的新的战争挑衅。从清晨到深夜，从市区到郊区，从大街到小巷，到处拥塞着示威游行的人群，参加的人数达二百五十万以上。这是上海历史上规模空前的一次反帝示威大游行。
    南京路在怒吼。在过去的黑暗年代里，上海人民曾经在这里和帝国主义进行过英勇的流血斗争。今天，怒不可遏的人们在这里汇成一股铁的巨流。“美国军队从台湾地区滚出去”的口号声响遍整条马路。有着跟帝国主义长期斗争传统的永安公司职工，昨天示威直到深夜，今天又参加游行。愤怒使他们忘掉了疲劳。
    六十九岁高龄的“革命妈妈”施小妹，上海工人三次武装起义的参加者，当她踏上南京路的时候，她想起了三十多年前“五卅”斗争的情景。那时候，有多少帝国主义的警捕、军警来对付我们赤手空拳的工人，我们一点也不怕，现在我们国家这样强大，美帝国主义居然还敢向我们挑衅，这简直是做梦。
    在今天的游行队伍中，还有曾参加过震惊国内外的1948年“二·二”罢工斗争的申新九厂老年女工周凤英。当她知道美帝国主义对我国进行战争恐吓的时候，她气得连话也说不出来了。她说：“疯狗要想钻进来，我们就打死它！”
    南京路尽头的黄浦江边，也密集着愤怒的人群。三十年来一直工作在黄浦江上的汽艇船员王德福抑制不住心头的怒火，虽然他昨晚通宵工作，今天又来到黄浦江边。他说，我们还没有和美帝国主义彻底清算旧债，它倒胆敢又来挑衅。但是现在的中国是什么样的中国！
    二十一年前在帝国主义侵略战火中变为平地闸北居民区的十多万群众，今天在新修起来的有着街心花园的宽阔马路上高举红旗前进。队伍在一排排从废墟上新建起来的四层楼红色住宅面前通过。
      “当祖国需要的时候，我们马上拿起枪……”，在复旦大学的学生饭厅里，传出了一阵阵激昂雄壮的歌声，这是数学系三年级同学的合唱。他们按捺不住心头的怒火，用激动人心的歌声，表示他们的抗议。一清早抗议集会在各班级同学的宿舍里不断地举行着。数学系二年级二班的学生，逐条驳斥杜勒斯的无耻声明。
    今天一早，曹阳新村——上海解放后新建的第一个工人住宅区沸腾了。居民委员会的办公室里挤满了人，磨墨的磨墨，裁纸的裁纸，准备下午游行的旗帜、标语和漫画。为了参加游行，妇女们老早把家务安排好了，婆婆叮嘱媳妇，女儿叮嘱妈妈“小菜少买点，早点收拾好游行去。”退休女工姚士芸生病刚从医院回来，媳妇劝她在家看孩子，她不肯，结果只好两个人带了孩子都参加了游行。
    游行结束后，正在大搞文化革命的人们马上投入了文艺创作的热潮中。短短的两个钟头里，他们写出：“美帝国主义太猖狂”，“竟敢在中国沿海耍花样”……等五首诗歌快板。在广慈医院里今天也不像往日那样静穆，各个病房的扩音器都一次再次地宣播了周总理的声明，病人们压抑不住心头的怒火，在病房里举行集会。著名的钢铁战士丘财康，他要求医生进一步加速治疗，让他争取提早出院，回到工作岗位上去，多炼钢铁支援解放台湾。
    全市工厂的工人们，上班时紧张的生产，下班后就纷纷举行各种抗议集会，决心同美国侵略者斗争到底。　（9月7日）
