The Whole Party Grasps Science, The Whole People Run Science, Production Uses Science
Anhui's Science and Technology Network is Interwoven

    (Our report) With the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production, a massive and magnificent high tide of scientific and technological research work of "the whole party grasping science, the whole people running science, and production using science" has emerged in Anhui Province. According to incomplete statistics, more than 54,000 scientific research institutions at all levels have been established throughout the province, and a vast and interwoven scientific and technological research network has begun to take shape throughout the province. The Anhui Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is about to be established. All special districts, cities, and counties in the province have successively established scientific research institutions under the general goals of "combining with production, combining with reality" and "serving steel production and serving agricultural production." For example, all fifteen counties in the Bengbu Special District have established scientific research institutes. At present, there are more than 2,300 various research institutions at the district and township levels, and 52,000 various research institutions established by people's communes, agricultural cooperatives, factories, mines, schools, etc., basically achieving research institutes, stations, and groups in every township and commune, and researchers in every team.

    In carrying out scientific and technological research work, all localities have fully implemented the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, relying on the masses, following the mass line, and vigorously engaging in scientific and technological work. In order to overcome difficulties such as cadres, funding, and equipment, they have adopted the methods of "making do with whatever is available," "working while setting up the framework," and "gradually improving and gradually regularizing," breaking people's mystical views of science and technology and ideas of "formalization" and "academicization." They have also widely absorbed and organized working people with rich practical knowledge and various intellectuals and technicians from all walks of life to carry out research work; implemented the policy of combining leadership with the masses, combining various types of personnel, and combining state-run with private-run, and deeply developed scientific and technological work. For example, in Bengbu Special District, more than 101,000 people from all walks of life have participated in scientific research institutions at all levels, and a mass scientific research movement has begun to take shape. In Da Xing Township, Feidong County, there was a research group that had no houses or utensils at the beginning, so they proposed the slogan "the wilderness is the laboratory, the tip of the tongue, fingers, and the sun are the instruments." After hard work, they spent only a little over four yuan and successfully trial-produced five products such as rayon.

    All levels of scientific research institutions in the province are closely integrated with production, focusing on researching and solving the urgent problems raised in local industrial and agricultural production, and carrying out research work according to the needs of production. Many special districts and counties have set up research offices or groups for industry, agricultural tool reform, farmland water conservancy, cultivation techniques, pests and diseases, and fertilizers according to production needs, and carried out scientific research work closely around production. The working principle of the research groups in Wuhu's factories and agricultural cooperatives is: research whatever is being done, and solve whatever problems exist. A research group at the city's textile factory conducted research on the one-way and high-speed operation of sliver making machines, increasing the speed of the sliver making machine from the original 190 revolutions per minute to 390 revolutions per minute, solving the problem of yarn breakage. Because scientific and technological research work is closely integrated with production, it has also greatly promoted the mass movement of tool reform and technological revolution.

    In carrying out scientific research work, all localities have universally combined it with scientific popularization work, and have given full play to the role of science popularization associations at all levels. Many county-level scientific research institutes were established on the basis of science popularization associations, and many science popularization work groups and science popularization teams are also scientific and technological research teams. Members of research institutions are generally also members of science popularization associations. Science popularization work has promoted the development of research work, and research work has also improved the quality of science popularization work. Many newly established scientific and technological research institutions have also vigorously trained cadres and carried out science popularization work. Encouraged by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the technological revolution movement, many scientific and technical personnel have also walked out of laboratories, gone deep into the front lines, gone deep into reality, learned from the masses, implemented the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and carried out scientific research work.

    Party committees at all levels have ensured that secretaries take action and politics take command in leading scientific and technological research work. The Scientific Research Institute of Liu'an County is headed by the county party secretary concurrently, and the county party propaganda minister, the industry and transportation minister, and the agriculture bureau chief concurrently serve as deputy directors, personally grasping scientific research work.

    全党抓科学　全民办科学　生产用科学
    安徽科学技术网纵横交错
    本报讯　随着工农业生产的高速度发展，安徽省已出现一个规模巨大、波澜壮阔的“全党抓科学、全民办科学、生产用科学”的科学技术研究工作高潮。据不完全统计，全省已建立的各级科学研究机构已达五万四千多个，一个庞大的纵横交错的科学技术研究网，已在全省开始形成。中国科学院安徽分院即将成立。全省各专区、市、县在“结合生产，结合实际”和“为钢铁生产服务，为农业生产服务”的总目标下，都陆续建立了科学研究机构。如蚌埠专区十五个县都建立了科学研究所。目前全省已有区、乡级各种研究机构二千三百多个，人民公社、农业社、厂矿、学校等建立的各种研究机构共五万二千个，基本上达到了乡乡社社有研究所、站、组，队队有研究员。
    各地在开展科学技术研究工作中，都充分贯彻了多快好省的方针，依靠群众，走群众路线，大搞科学技术工作。为了克服干部、经费、设备等困难，他们采取了“因陋就简”，“边搭架子边工作”和“逐步完善、逐步正规”的办法，打破了人们对科学技术的神秘观念和“正规化”、“学院化”的思想，并广泛吸收和组织各行各业有丰富实践知识的劳动人民和各种知识分子和技术人员开展研究工作；实行领导与群众相结合，各类人员相结合，国家与民办相结合的方针，深入开展科学技术工作。如蚌埠专区目前参加各级科学研究机构的各行各业人员已达十万一千多人，已开始形成了一个群众性的科学研究运动。肥东县大兴乡有一个研究小组，开始时没有房屋和用具，他们就提出“野外当研究室、舌尖、手指、太阳当仪器”的口号，经过苦战，仅用了四元多钱，就试制成功人造棉等五种产品。
    全省各级科学研究机构，都紧密地结合生产，以研究和解决当地工农业生产中所提出的迫切问题为主，根据生产的需要进行研究工作。不少专区、县都根据生产需要分设了工业、农具改革、农田水利、耕作技术、病虫害、肥料等研究室或小组，紧密围绕生产，进行科学研究工作。芜湖各工厂、农业社的研究小组的工作原则是：做什么研究什么，存在什么问题就解决什么问题。该市纺织厂一个研究小组对条子车单程化、高速化进行了研究，把条子车转速由原来每分钟一百九十转提高了三百九十转，解决了纱的断头问题。由于科学技术研究工作紧密地结合生产进行，也大大地推动了群众性的工具改革和技术革命运动。
    在开展科学研究工作中，各地都普遍和科学普及工作紧密结合起来，充分发挥了各级科普协会组织的作用，不少县的科学研究所就是在科普协会的基础上建立起来的，很多科普工作组、科普小组也就是科学技术研究小组，研究机构的成员一般也都是科普协会的会员。科学普及工作推动了研究工作的开展，研究工作也提高了科普工作的质量。许多新成立的科学技术研究机构，还大力培训了干部，开展科普工作。在工农业生产大跃进和技术革命运动的鼓舞下，不少科学技术人员也纷纷走出了实验室，深入现场，深入实际，拜群众为师，实行土洋结合，进行科学研究工作。
    各级党委在领导科学技术研究工作中，都做到书记动手和政治挂帅。六安县的科学研究所由县委书记兼主任，县委宣传部长、工业交通部长和农业局长兼任副主任，亲自抓科学研究工作。
