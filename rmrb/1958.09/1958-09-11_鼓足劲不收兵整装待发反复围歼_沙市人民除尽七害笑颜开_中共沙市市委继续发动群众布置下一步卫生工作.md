    Muster Strength, Don't Withdraw Troops, Re-equip and Prepare to Go, Repeatedly Encircle and Annihilate.
    Shashi People Eradicate the Seven Pests and Smile with Joy.
    The CCP Shashi Municipal Committee Continues to Mobilize the Masses to Arrange the Next Step in Sanitation Work
    (Our Newspaper Correspondent Zhang Wei) reported: Since January of this year, Shashi, Hubei, launched a large-scale sanitation campaign to eliminate the seven pests (rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, flies, bedbugs, fleas, cockroaches). The city's people have conducted dozens of surprise attacks. By May 1st, the seven pests were basically eliminated, and the achieved results have been consolidated for several months. Recently, the Central Hygiene Inspection Team inspected Shashi's sanitation work and highly praised Shashi's basic elimination of the seven pests and the masses' beginning to develop good hygiene habits.
    Shashi is close to the Yangtze River, and there are thirty-two sewage ponds in the city, with water areas accounting for one-third of the city's total area. There is no drainage system in the city. The city's public and private toilets are all dug cesspools or buried manure tanks, with no sanitary equipment to speak of. Flies and rats were everywhere, and the number of mosquitoes was so great that local people used the word "thick" to describe them. Since January, the CCP Shashi Municipal Committee has led the masses to carry out the work of eliminating the seven pests with a revolutionary spirit of hard work. They captured more than 183,000 rats, killed more than 48,000 sparrows, and eliminated more than 10,000 catties of flies. This summer, every household in the city did not hang mosquito nets. People have developed good hygiene habits in the movement to eliminate the seven pests. Neither the elderly nor children spit or litter fruit peels everywhere. One day, a passenger car from Jingzhou passed through a road in Shashi when suddenly a mouthful of sputum flew out of the car window. The elementary school students passing by immediately stopped the car and went into the car to ask who spit the sputum? No passengers admitted it. At this time, the surrounding pedestrians came up to investigate, until the person who spit sputum admitted his mistake to the people, then they let the car go.
    The result of Shashi people paying attention to hygiene is that the summer's infectious diseases have been greatly reduced. In 1957, there were 404 cases, while this year, by the end of July, there were 34 cases. Patients with dysentery, typhoid fever, and other diseases have decreased significantly this year compared with previous years.
    People's happy mood for getting rid of the seven pests is indescribable. They sang: "Sleeping at night without mosquito nets, Enjoying the cool under the trees in the hot weather, Fish swimming in the pond, Flowers blooming in front of the door. Everyone thanks the Communist Party, This is thanks to Chairman Mao's brilliance."
    Why can the people of Shashi eliminate the seven pests in a short time, and consolidate their achievements to keep the sanitation movement regular? The important reason is that the CCP Shashi Municipal Committee has a firm grasp of the leadership of sanitation work. There are two specific experiences:
    First, fully mobilize the masses to make the elimination of the seven pests and paying attention to hygiene a conscious action of the masses. At the beginning of the movement, the city held a city-wide people's mobilization meeting. After the meeting, various agencies, factories, shops, street residents' committees all conducted major debates separately, mobilizing the masses to recognize the importance of eliminating the seven pests by recalling the past, and to recognize that eliminating the seven pests is in the people's own vital interests. In the movement, they also used more than a dozen forms to mobilize the masses, such as oath-taking rallies, street propaganda, on-site meetings, visits and comparisons, exhibitions, and big-character posters. Since the movement, a total of more than 1.5 million people have been mobilized, and thousands of people have fought the seven pests every day.
    Second, constantly oppose right-leaning slack thinking, so that the movement remains regular. On this issue, the Municipal Party Committee has taken two measures. One is to always stand at the forefront of the movement and constantly put forward new tasks. Since this spring, they have led the city's people in two major battles and organized thirty-seven major surprise attacks, with almost one small surprise attack every week. The other is to stipulate a regular inspection system: the residents' committee inspects once a day, the street office inspects once a week, and the city inspects once a month for major inspections and every half month for minor inspections. In the movement, the Municipal Party Committee constantly struggled against right-leaning paralysis thinking.
    After the Central Hygiene Inspection Team inspected Shashi's sanitation work, the headquarters of the Municipal Party Committee for eliminating the seven pests held another city-wide mobilization meeting to arrange the sanitation work for September and the fourth quarter.

### 鼓足劲不收兵整装待发反复围歼  沙市人民除尽七害笑颜开  中共沙市市委继续发动群众布置下一步卫生工作

    鼓足劲不收兵整装待发反复围歼
    沙市人民除尽七害笑颜开
    中共沙市市委继续发动群众布置下一步卫生工作
    本报讯　记者张碨报道：湖北沙市自今年1月开始了大规模的除七害（鼠、雀、蚊、蝇、臭虫、跳蚤、蟑螂）讲卫生运动以来，全市人民进行了数十次的突击战斗，5月1日已基本上消除七害，数月来并巩固了已得成绩。最近中央卫生检查团检查了沙市的卫生工作，对沙市基本消除七害和群众开始养成讲卫生习惯非常赞扬。
    沙市紧临长江，市内污水塘三十二个，水区占全市总面积的三分之一。市内没有排水系统。全市的公私厕所都是挖的粪坑或埋的粪缸，说不上什么卫生设备。苍蝇老鼠等到处都是，蚊子之多，当地人们是用“厚”字来形容的。1月份以来，中共沙市市委领导群众以革命的苦干精神进行了除七害工作。他们共捕鼠十八万三千多只，灭雀四万八千多只，灭蝇一万多斤。今年夏天全市家家户户不挂蚊帐。人们在除七害运动中养成了良好的卫生习惯。不管是老人和小孩都不随地吐痰，不随地丢果皮。一天，一辆从荆州开来的客运汽车，路过沙市的马路时，突然从车窗飞出一口痰来。过路的小学生马上拦住了汽车，上车去查问痰是谁吐的？没有一个旅客承认。这时，围上来的行人都纷纷追查，直到吐痰的人向人们承认了错误，人们才放汽车走了。
    沙市人民讲卫生的结果，使夏季的流行性疾病大大减少，1957年为四百零四例，而今年到7月底为止患者为三十四例，痢疾及伤寒等病患者今年都比往年显著减少。
    人们对除掉七害的愉快心情是难以形容的，他们唱着：“晚上睡觉不用帐，炎天树荫好乘凉，鱼儿池里来游荡，门前鲜花朵朵香。人人感谢共产党，这是沾的毛主席的光。”
    沙市人民为什么能在短时间除尽七害，而且巩固成绩使卫生运动保持经常化呢？重要的原因是中共沙市市委对卫生工作的领导抓得紧。具体经验有两条：
    一是充分发动群众，使除七害讲卫生成为群众的自觉行动。全市在运动开始曾召开了全市人民动员大会，会后各机关、工厂、商店、街道各居民委员会都分别进行了大辩论，发动群众用回忆的办法认识除七害的重要性，认识到除七害是人民自己的切身利益。运动中，他们还运用了誓师大会、街头宣传、现场会、参观评比、展览会、大字报等十几种形式发动群众。运动以来共发动群众一百五十多万人次，每天有成千上万的人与七害搏斗。
    二是不断反对右倾松气思想，使运动保持经常化。在这个问题上，市委采取了两个措施，一个是始终站在运动前面，不断提出新的任务。今春以来，他们领导全市人民进行了两次大的战役，组织了三十七次大的突击，几乎每周还有一次小突击。另一个是规定了经常的检查制度：居民委员会每天一检查，街道办事处一星期一检查，市里一月一大检查，半月小检查。在运动中市委不断与右倾麻痹思想进行斗争。
    中央卫生检查团检查了沙市的卫生工作后，市委除七害总指挥部又召开了全市性的动员大会，布置了9月份及第四季度的卫生工作。
