Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Telegram - The first domestically-made 2,500-ton forging hydraulic press manufactured by Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant was born on the 1st, four months ahead of schedule. It marks another step forward in the manufacturing technology of China's heavy machinery manufacturing industry.
　　This forging hydraulic press is an important machine for manufacturing large forgings for large metallurgical, large power station, chemical, and shipbuilding equipment. It weighs a total of 473 tons and is more than 47 feet high. Under the powerful pressure of this machine, a red-hot 48-ton steel ingot is forged into various shapes like a dough.
　　This machine was designed independently by more than ten young technicians. They received assistance from Soviet experts while learning the design.
　　Now, the factory's employees are continuing to work hard to ensure that two more hydraulic presses will be produced this year.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 5th - The Nanjing Automobile Factory trial-produced a sedan with a fiberglass body on the 2nd.
　　This car has two rows of seats and can accommodate five people. The car is fully equipped with instruments, lighting, radio, electric clock, etc., and is beautiful and generous. It is very stable when driving on any road.
　　The car engine is manufactured by the factory itself, with a maximum power of 52 horsepower. When driving under normal load on a flat road, the maximum speed is 105 kilometers per hour. The car body is made of glass fiber and polyester plastic, which has the properties of acid resistance, rust resistance, water resistance, and high-temperature resistance. It is sturdy, light, and flexible, with only one-third the weight of a steel plate body, which can improve engine efficiency, increase load capacity, and save steel for the country.
　　The trial production of the sedan was carried out using spare time while intensively producing trucks in batches.

　　2500吨水压机诞生
    玻璃钢车身小轿车在南京制成
    据新华社沈阳电　沈阳重型机器厂制造的国产第一台二千五百吨锻造水压机，提前四个月在1日诞生。它标志着我国重型机器制造工业的制造技术又向前跨进了一步。
    这台锻造水压机是制造大型冶金、大型电站、化工等设备及船舶的大锻钢件的重要机器。它的总重量有四百七十三吨，高四十七尺多。赤热的四十八吨重的大钢锭在这台机器的强大压力下，如同一个面团，被任意锻压成各种形状。
    这台机器是由十多名青年技术员自行设计的。他们在学习设计时，得到了苏联专家的帮助。
    现在这个厂的职工正在继续苦战，保证今年再增产两台水压机。
    新华社南京5日电　南京汽车制造厂2日试制出一辆用玻璃钢作车身的小轿车。
    这种汽车有两排座位，可乘坐五人。车内仪表、照明、收音机、电钟等设备俱全，美观大方，在任何路面上行驶时都很稳定。
    汽车发动机是这个厂自行制造的，最大功率为五十二马力。在平坦道路上正常载荷行驶时，最大速度为每小时一百零五公里。汽车车身是用玻璃纤维和聚脂塑料胶合而成，具有防酸、防锈、防水、耐高温等性能，质量坚固，轻便灵巧，只有钢板车身三分之一的重量，可以提高发动机的效能，增加载重量，为国家节省钢材。
    小轿车的试制工作是在紧张地成批生产载重汽车的同时，利用业余时间进行的。
