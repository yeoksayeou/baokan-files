　　The Steel Seizing Chronicle
　　By our reporter Zhao Shenying
　　On the evening of August 22nd, when the Party Committee of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant decided to immediately establish a converter steelmaking workshop with an annual output of 100,000 tons of steel, the planned site was still growing corn and beans.

　　In just fourteen days, steel water was already gushing from the steelmaking furnace on this land.

　　Valuable "Guerrilla Habits"

　　On the evening of August 22nd, the factory Party Committee's meeting on seizing steel continued until 11:00 PM. After the meeting, the Party Secretary and factory directors went to inspect the construction site overnight. Early on the morning of the 23rd, the entire factory held an emergency meeting of cadres, and the battle order was immediately issued to the entire factory: organize the team within one day, transport urgently needed materials and construction equipment to the construction site, the design department should go to the Metallurgical Industry Publishing House to buy blueprints, revise them by 24:00 at night, and after a little, all relevant units should go to the design department to ask for blueprints and rush to manufacture converter equipment within a limited time; start construction on the 24th and put it into production within half a month.

　　After the meeting, the Party Secretary, Deputy Secretary, factory director, and deputy factory director all came to the construction site. They walked in front, temporarily demarcating the factory site, the bulldozer followed behind to level the ground, the power grid followed behind to pull over, and the trucks and carts transporting materials and construction equipment also followed behind with a booming sound. The construction site was immediately bustling with traffic and people.

　　A large number of agricultural cooperative members also came early in the morning with their sickles. They were full of enthusiasm and high spirits. They cut down the corn and beans on the factory site within two hours. They said excitedly: Produce tens of thousands of tons of steel! Tens of thousands of tons of steel are worth much more than our corn. The factory leaders measured the factory site and looked at the design drawings. The factory site was still not enough. Some agricultural cooperative members, upon hearing that the factory site was still not enough, immediately and voluntarily pulled up a piece of crops.

　　Water was connected to the construction site within two hours, electricity was connected in one and a half hours, and the railway line was quickly laid to the construction site.

　　This scene reminded people of the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, when the military and civilians were united as one, and commanders and combatants went to the front line together. Some people said: This has some "guerrilla habits", but it is precisely because this factory has this kind of "guerrilla habits" that it won a victory in a steel seizing battle in a very short period of time.

　　Everyone wants a share

　　Everyone knows that this is a political task, and everyone wants to participate in this battle to seize steel. However, the workers of the expanding large-scale iron and steel complex and the workers of various production workshops and other departments number in the tens of thousands. How can they all come to this construction site? Here, only a part of the manpower can be drawn from the six engineering offices of basic construction and relevant production workshops to participate in this construction task according to needs.

　　However, as soon as the Second Engineering Office gave the task to the recycling section, the workers of the blast furnace and coking furnace sections said: That won't work. We have to work in three shifts, and everyone has to participate. As a result, each section drew a mixed production team. The Third Engineering Office gave the task to the third section. The workers of the first and second sections said: Whatever the third section needs, we will give it. Under the name of support, many people from the first and second sections also participated.

　　The construction site constantly received calls from various workshops, asking for tasks. At 12:00 on the evening of the 25th, the person in charge of the thermal power workshop called the construction site and said, "We will send twenty people after work. Please prepare tasks for us." As a result, they were assigned the task of building a sewer project. So, they came to participate in voluntary labor every second half of the night.

　　The hospital sent people to the construction site to register twice, but they were not registered. They formed a mobile medical team to come to the construction site. The workers in the various canteens were not approved to participate in the labor on the construction site, so they delivered steamed buns and fried cakes every day. The construction site had fried hairtail, smoked chicken, bread, cakes... They proposed to serve to save every minute of the workers' time. All the workers in the factory took time to participate in voluntary labor on the construction site.

　　On the first day of construction - the 24th, the director of the Second Engineering Office, who was responsible for pouring concrete, came early in the morning with a large group of people. Seeing that there were no conditions for pouring concrete yet, they picked up shovels and started digging earthwork. Hearing that a small bridge in the west, which was the responsibility of the Third Engineering Office, needed to be reinforced to allow a fifteen-ton tank crane to pass, they jumped into the ditch and started repairing the bridge.

　　Every second counts

　　Walking into the factory, one feels a surge of energy, and one's arms and legs feel strong and powerful.

　　The night is the same as the day, and the electric lights illuminate the construction site brightly. Red flags flutter on the roof frame. The sound of motors, the sound of command whistles, and the sound of broadcasting form a grand chorus. The workers pouring concrete are pushing their carts not walking, but running. Earthwork is being dug here, concrete is being poured there, roof frames are being built above, chimneys are being built, and converters are being installed below.

　　At first glance, it seems a bit chaotic, but upon closer inspection, the work is developing according to certain rules. Here, all unnecessary rigid procedures and regulations have been broken, and a battle for every second is being carried out.

　　Without design drawings, construction cannot be carried out, and construction cannot run ahead of design. However, such an interesting thing happened here: On the morning of the 23rd - the day before the start of construction, when the people in the design department were following the instructions of the Party Committee to revise the design drawings before midnight, an old worker sent by the Sixth Engineering Office ran into the office, eager to get the drawings. In order to seize every second, the worker was determined to start construction the day before construction started. But the drawings could not be drawn all at once. What to do? So, this experienced old worker took action himself. He took out a pen, and while watching the designers draw the drawings, he also "drew a gourd according to the ladle". After a while, he took the steel beam "drawings" he had traced and ran back to the construction site. By the time the designers delivered the drawings to the construction site ahead of schedule at 5:00 PM, the steel beams had already been manufactured ahead of schedule.

　　On the 27th - the evening of the fourth day of construction, it rained all night. The workers shouted the slogan "Small rain doesn't stop, heavy rain is dry." As the rain got heavier and heavier, the workers of Shi Wenli's bricklaying team said: "No matter how the rain falls, we will work all night." That night, they completed the bricklaying task five hours ahead of schedule, and their work efficiency was twice as high as usual.

　　Rainwater flowed down from the clothes and necks of the workers in Dan Xiangqi's riveting team, and they also worked for nine hours. The work done in these nine hours was twice as much as the work done in twelve hours the night before.

　　The workers not only won time by relying on their drive, but they also carried out many technical innovations, which shortened the time tenfold or dozens of times. Dan Xiangqi's riveting team created the hydraulic fixed rounding method, assembling four converter caps in ninety-eight minutes, increasing work efficiency by sixty times.

　　How many converters can be built in a year

　　A command post was established on the construction site, and a list of "commanders on night duty" was hung in the command post. A deputy secretary of the Party Committee and three deputy factory directors served as construction site commanders. Like the workers, they fought here day and night, and ate their meals on the construction site. Two steamed buns with two pieces of pickles or two fried cakes were a meal. During the two days I was on the construction site, it was difficult to sit down and talk to the commanders once. I saw them several times, either they were busy solving problems with the workers, or they disappeared in a blink of an eye. Later, I walked a whole circle on the construction site with Gu Shoumin, deputy secretary of the Party Committee. He went to the converter to move the rudder wheel and check the operation of the converter. Then, he climbed to another converter to ask the workers about the lining of the furnace, and then he climbed the high chimney, hand-grabbing the rope and foot-stepping on the scaffolding, to understand the chimney construction.

　　One day at noon, the workers were all eating lunch. I had a short conversation with Deputy Factory Director Li Jie in the command post. His safety helmet was placed on the table, and two fried cakes were placed on the safety helmet. It seemed that he had not eaten lunch yet and was talking to a technician about engineering issues. He was the commander who was more responsible for commanding this project. In the past ten days, he only returned to the factory office for two half-day meetings. Talking about engineering issues, he said: "Think about it! Building several converters with an annual output of 100,000 tons of steel in fourteen days. At this rate, the converters built in a year can produce nearly 2 million tons of steel annually."

　　This sentence is quite thought-provoking. Seizing every second, striving for high speed, if every iron and steel construction site can seize every minute and every second like this, our country's steel will fly straight up like an eagle with wings.

　　夺钢记
　　本报记者　赵慎应
    8月22日晚间，中共石景山钢铁厂党委会决定立即建立一个年产十万吨钢的转炉炼钢车间的时候，计划中的厂地上还长着一片玉米和豆子。
    仅仅用了十四天，在这片土地上，炼钢炉里已经奔出了钢水。
    可贵的“游击习气”
    8月22日晚上，工厂党委会关于争夺钢的会议，一直开到深夜十一点钟。开罢会，党委书记和厂长们，连夜就去查看了工地。23日一早，全厂又召开了一个干部紧急会议，战斗命令立即下达到了全厂：一天内，把队伍组织好，急需的材料和施工设备都运到工地，设计科去冶金工业出版社买好图纸，晚上二十四点钟前修改完毕，下一点，各有关单位都到设计科里要图纸，限期赶制出转炉设备；24日开工，半个月内投入生产。
    开罢会，党委书记、副书记、厂长、副厂长，又都来到工地，他们前面走，临时划定厂地，平土机就在后面跟着开过来，电线网就在后面跟着拉过来，运送材料和施工设备的汽车、马车，也在后面跟着轰轰隆隆开过来，工地上一时车水马龙，人声沸腾。
    大批农业社员，一早也都带着镰刀来了，他们情绪饱满，志气昂扬，两小时内就砍完了工厂需要作为厂地的玉米和豆子，他们兴奋地说：多出几万吨钢吧！几万吨钢比我们这一点玉米值钱得多。工厂领导上丈量了一下厂地，又看了看设计图纸，厂地还是不够用，有些农业社员一听说厂地还不够，就又立即自动地拔了一片庄稼。
    工地上，两小时内通水，一小时半通了电，铁路线也迅速地铺到了工地。
    这种情景，使人回忆到抗日战争、解放战争时期，军民团结一条心，指挥员战斗员一起上前线的情景。有人说：这有些“游击习气”，可是，正是由于这个工厂有了这种“游击习气”，在极短时间内，在一场争夺钢的战斗中赢得了胜利。
    谁都想挨上一份
    谁都知道这是一项政治任务，谁都想参加这场为争夺钢的战斗。可是扩建大型钢铁联合企业的职工和各生产车间以及其他部门的职工，有几万人，他们怎么能都到这个工地上来呢？这里只能根据需要，由基本建设的六个工程处和有关生产车间抽出一部分人力，参加这一项建设任务。
    可是，第二工程处把任务刚交给回收工段，高炉、焦炉两个工段的职工说：那不行，我们三班倒着干，大家都得参加。结果，每个工段都抽出了一个混合生产队。第三工程处把任务给了第三工段，第一、二工段职工说：三工段需要什么，我们给什么。在支援的名义下，第一、二工段也参加了许多人。
    工地上不断接到各车间的电话，要求给任务。25日晚间十二点钟了，热力车间负责人给工地上来电话说：“我们下班后要去二十个人，请给我们准备任务。”结果，他们分到了修筑下水道工程的任务。于是，他们每天后半夜就来参加义务劳动了。
    医院里派人来工地挂了两次号，没有挂上。他们就成立了一个巡回医疗队来到工地上。各个食堂的职工没有被批准参加工地上的劳动，就每天给送馒头和油饼。工地上有炸带鱼、醺鸡、面包、蛋糕……，他们提出为节省工人们的每一分钟而服务。工厂所有职工，都抽空到工地上参加义务劳动。
    开工第一天——24日，负责浇灌混凝土的第二工程处主任带着大队人马一大早就来了，看见还没条件灌混凝土，就拿起铁锨挖起土方来。听说西面三工程负责的一个小桥需要加固，要走十五吨的坦克吊，就跳进水沟里修起桥来。
    分秒必争
    走进工厂，使人浑身鼓起一股劲，胳膊、腿都感到结实有力。
    夜里和白天一样，电灯光把工地照得通明，红旗在屋架上飘扬。马达声、指挥哨声、广播声，混成一个大合唱。浇灌混凝土的工人推着车不是在走，而是在飞跑。这边挖土方，那边就灌混凝土，上面搭着屋架子，在砌着烟筒，下面就安装起转炉。
    乍看起来，好像有点紊乱，仔细看起来，工作却是在按着一定的规律发展着。这里只是打破了一切不必要的死板的程序和规章，而进行着一场分秒必争的战斗。
    没有设计图纸，就不能施工，施工不能跑在设计的前面。但是，这里却发生了这样一件有趣的事情：23日上午——开工的前一天，设计科的人正在按照党委指示，要在午夜前修改好设计图纸的时候，六工程处派来的一个老工人跑到了办公室里，急着要图纸。为了分秒必争，工人决心要在开工前一天开工。但是图纸不能一下绘出来。怎么办呢？于是，这个有经验的老工人亲自动手了，他掏出笔来，一面看设计人员绘图纸，一面也“照葫芦画瓢”地画起来。一会，他就带着自己描好的钢梁“图纸”跑回了工地。等到下午五点钟，设计人员提前把图纸送到工地时，钢梁已经在提前制造了。
    27日——开工第四天的晚上，下了一夜大雨。职工们喊出了“小雨不停大雨干”的口号。雨越下越大，史文礼砌砖小组的工人们说：“不管雨怎样下，我们也要干个通宵。”这一夜，他们提前五小时完成了砌砖任务，工作效率比平常提高了一倍。
    雨水从单象起铆工小组工人们的衣服上和脖子里往下直流，他们也一直干了九个钟头。这九个钟头干的活，等于前一天晚上十二个钟点干的活的两倍。
    工人们不光是凭干劲，赢得时间，他们进行了许多技术革新，使时间成十倍、几十倍地缩短了。单象起铆工小组创造油压固定找圆法，九十八分钟组立了四个转炉帽子，工作效率提高了六十倍。
    一年能建成多少转炉
    工地上成立了指挥部，指挥部里挂着“指挥员值夜班”的名单。一个党委副书记和三个副厂长担任着工地指挥员。他们和工人一样，日夜在这里战斗着，饭也在工地上吃。两个馒头夹上两块咸菜或者两个油饼，就是一顿饭。我在工地上两天，都难以和指挥员们坐下来谈一次话，几次看到了他们，不是他们忙着和职工们解决问题，就是一转眼又不见了。后来，我就和党委副书记谷受民在工地上走了一整圈，他去转炉旁搬动着舵轮，检查转炉的运转情形后，又爬到另一个转炉上向工人们问着砌炉衬的情况，接着又手攀着绳子，脚登着脚手架，上到高高的烟筒上去了解烟筒砌筑的情况。
    一天中午，工人们都在吃午餐，我在指挥部里和李杰副厂长作了短时间的谈话，他的安全帽放在桌上，两个油饼放在安全帽上，看样子他还没吃午餐，正和一个技术人员谈着工程的问题。他是更多地负责指挥这个工程的指挥员，他在过去的十天中，只回工厂办公室开了两个半天的会议。谈到工程问题，他说：“想一想吧！十四天建起几座年产十万吨钢的转炉，照这样的速度，一年建成的转炉就能年产将及二百多万吨钢。”
    这句话，颇令人深思。分秒必争，力争高速度，每个钢铁工地上都能这样抓住一分一秒，我们国家的钢将会像长起翅膀的长鹰一样向上直飞。
