Riding the Electrified Steed
    ——A Record of the Electricity Pavilion at the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition
    By Our Correspondent Luo Xuan
    Electricity can bring warmth, bring light, and can also be transformed into various mechanical energies.... All modern science and technology cannot be separated from electricity. It is the pioneer industry of our socialist construction and the material foundation of the technological revolution.

    The charts in the Electricity Pavilion of the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition show that in the eight years since the founding of New China, the power generation and the increase in equipment capacity of China's power industry have surpassed the sixty-eight years since electricity existed in Old China. This year, the country's power generation will increase by 42% compared to last year, reaching 27.5 billion kilowatt-hours; the newly added power generation capacity of large and medium-sized power stations alone is expected to be 1.4 million kilowatts, which is close to the total installed capacity added nationwide in the last three years of the First Five-Year Plan. According to the plan currently being prepared by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power for 1959, the development speed next year will greatly exceed this year. These figures vividly depict how China's power industry is speeding up to pave the way for the high-speed development of China's industrial and agricultural production.

    “Hydropower First, Thermal Power Second”

    As we toured the Electricity Pavilion, paying attention to the large amount of exhibited materials, the first thing that came to mind was the long-term construction policy for the power industry of "hydropower first, thermal power second" proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This policy pointed out the correct path for the great development of China's power industry.

    On the eastern wall of the Electricity Pavilion is a distribution map of China's hydropower resources, which is filled with green rivers and red and yellow hydropower sites. This map shows that China is the country with the richest hydropower resources in the world, with a total reserve of 540 million kilowatts. The Yangtze River alone is equal to the total hydropower resources of the entire Europe.

    "Hydropower first, thermal power second"—what a clear and distinct construction policy. In order to realize this policy, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power has already taken a series of measures. This year, the number of newly built and continued large and medium-sized hydropower stations has increased from the original twenty-one to fifty-eight. Some large-scale water conservancy and hydropower hubs that were originally scheduled to start construction in the middle of the Second Five-Year Plan or during the Third Five-Year Plan, such as Liujiaxia and Yanguoxia in Gansu, Danjiangkou in Hubei, Jianxi in Fujian, and Longwangmiao in Jilin, have all been started ahead of schedule this year. The large number of small and medium-sized reservoirs and irrigation canals built in the upsurge of water conservancy last winter and this spring will all have power stations added where possible; in the future, water conservancy projects will be built in conjunction with hydropower stations. In order to continuously increase the proportion of hydropower in the entire power industry, there are now thousands of surveying and design personnel working on the main and tributary streams of more than forty rivers across the country. The huge model displayed at the entrance of the Electricity Pavilion—the Yangtze River Three Gorges Water Conservancy Hub—is one that is actively being surveyed and designed. Not long ago, this project was considered a problem that could only be considered in the distant future, but now a model based on the preliminary selected dam site and the envisioned construction plan is also on display to the people of the whole country. According to the model, in the future, the turbulent river water rolling down from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River will be blocked here by a dam more than 200 meters high, and will obediently drive the hydraulic turbine generators in the factory to generate powerful electricity before being diverted downstream. A ship lock will be opened on the left bank of the river to allow ships to pass.

    After the completion of the Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze River, the installed capacity will be five or six times larger than the world's largest Soviet Bratsk Hydropower Station currently under construction, becoming the center of the national power grid.

    While actively developing hydropower, various places are also building a large number of thermal power plants to adapt to the rapidly growing power needs and rationally utilize power resources. This year, there are 119 large and medium-sized thermal power plants being built nationwide that are above the quota.

    Electricity in Every County and Township

    "Combining large, medium, and small, and mobilizing the whole people to run electricity" is an important factor in the rapid development of China's power industry as expressed by the exhibition.

    If during the First Five-Year Plan period, China's power industry was only "run by the Ministry of Electric Power alone," then the many materials displayed at the exhibition prove that now twenty-seven provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions), more than 2,000 counties, and tens of thousands of townships are running electricity, and men, women, old, and young, cities or villages, are all starting to build power stations. The power resources they use are also diverse. In addition to water and coal, there are also wind power, animal power, biogas, petroleum, tidal power, and even firewood, rice husks, weeds, manure, and sewage, etc.

    On the east side of the Electricity Pavilion, against the wall, are two small models. Although their decoration is not as beautiful as the models of large power stations, they often attract the attention of a large group of people.

   One of them is the Youth Four-Energy Combined Power Station in Dawangwu Township, Anci County, created by farmers in the Tianjin Special District. This power station is equipped with four kinds of power machinery: windmill, wooden water turbine, biogas digester, and boiler-towing machine. They jointly drive a generator and other processing machines. Usually, when there is water, electricity is generated with water; when there is a water shortage, electricity is generated with wind; if there is neither water nor wind, electricity is generated using biogas or gas. According to the commentator, this kind of power station can not only generate electricity all year round, but also has very low electricity generation costs. Now, many places in the Tianjin Special District are promoting this kind of combined power station.

    This is just one example of the rural electrification movement that is currently flourishing. In the first half of this year, thousands of rural hydropower stations have been built across the country. This winter and next spring, at least five counties and one hundred agricultural cooperatives in each province will achieve initial electrification.

    While accelerating rural electrification, hundreds of large and medium-sized hydro and thermal power stations are also being established under the unified planning of various provinces. Among them, there are 177 large and medium-sized power stations alone that are above the quota, and their design capacity is five times the current total capacity of all power generation equipment in the country.

    Climbing to the Peak of World Technology

    On the west side of the Electricity Pavilion, there are many inventions and creations by Chinese electrical workers that have reached or exceeded international standards, most of which are products of the Great Leap Forward. Among them are cement power poles across the river that are twice as high as the gilded spire of the Beijing Exhibition Hall, a universal cable fault detector uniquely created in China, a lightweight transformer inter-turn insulation tester, and a computer for factory frame structure, etc.

    During the First Five-Year Plan period, most of the modern power plants built in China still needed Soviet assistance in design and construction, but now we have not only learned the complete set of technologies taught to us by the Soviet Union, but also gigantic power stations dozens of times larger than those built at that time, such as Danjiangkou, Three Gorges, Wuqiangxi, Liujiaxia, and Beijing Gaojing, can all be designed by ourselves. The construction speed of power stations has also been greatly accelerated. The exhibition compared the construction periods of three large hydro and thermal power stations, all of which were shortened by more than half compared to the original plan. For example, the Beijing No. 1 Thermal Power Plant, with a power generation capacity of 200,000 kilowatts, started construction in August last year, and the first generating unit was put into production in September this year.

    At the end of the Electricity Pavilion is a colorful lighting map arranged like a sky full of stars, depicting the bright future of China's power industry. In the near future, hundreds of large-scale water conservancy hub projects that are under construction and about to be built on China's vast territory will be completed. These hubs, combined with countless small and medium-sized hydro and thermal power stations, will tame the thousands of rivers and waters densely distributed throughout the country to generate electricity and irrigate us. The plans for "diverting water from the south to the north" and "diverting the Yangtze River to relieve the Yellow River" will also be realized, so that the water-deficient Yellow River can also generate strong electricity. At the same time, with the completion of the Three Gorges Water Conservancy Hub, the country will be united into a unified power grid. In areas where power resources are insufficient and electricity consumption is concentrated, a large number of atomic energy and thermonuclear energy power stations will also be established. At that time, whether in cities or villages, electricity will become the most common power source in people's production and life. The night will be as bright as day, and the picture of "farming without cattle and lighting without oil," which farmers have dreamed of for many years, will also be realized in all rural areas of the country.

    跨上电气化的骏马
    ——记全国工业交通展览会电力馆
    本报记者　罗漩
    电，能给人带来温暖、带来光明，也可以转变为各种机械能……。一切现代的科学技术都离不开电。它是我国社会主义建设的先行工业，也是技术革命的物质基础。
    全国工业交通展览会电力馆的图表表明，我国电力工业在新中国成立以来的八年中，发电量和设备增加容量都胜过了旧中国有电以来的六十八年。今年，全国的发电量又将比去年增长42％，达到二百七十五亿度；新增加的发电能力仅大中型电站预计有一百四十万瓩，接近第一个五年计划的后三年全国增加的发电设备容量的总和。按照目前水利电力部正在编制的1959年的计划，明年的发展速度还将大大超过今年。这些数字，生动地描绘了我国电力工业是在怎样快马加鞭、为高速度发展我国工农业生产开道。
    “水电为主，火电为辅”
    我们巡回在电力馆里，注视着大量的展出材料，首先想到的便是中共中央提出的“水电为主，火电为辅”的电力工业长期建设方针。这个方针为我国电力工业的大发展指出了正确的道路。
    在电力馆东部墙上有一幅我国水力资源的分布地图，上面画满了绿色的河流和红、黄色的水力地址。这张地图说明我国是世界上水力资源最丰富的国家，总蕴藏量达五亿四千万瓩，仅仅一条长江，就等于整个欧洲水力资源的总和。
    “水电为主，火电为辅”，这是一个多么鲜明的建设方针。为了实现这一方针，水利电力部已经采取了一系列的措施。今年新建和续建的大中型水电站，已从原定的二十一个增加到五十八个。原定在第二个五年计划中期或是第三个五年计划期间开工建设的一些大水利电力枢纽，如甘肃的刘家峡、盐锅峡，湖北的丹江口，福建的建溪，吉林的龙王庙等，现在都提前在今年上马。各地在去冬今春水利高潮中修建的大批中小型水库和灌溉渠道，凡是可以发电的都要补建发电站；今后修建水利工程，都将同时配合修建水电站。为了不断提高水电在整个电力工业中的比重，现在全国还有几千名勘测设计人员在四十多条河流的干支流上工作。陈列在电力馆门口的巨大模型——长江三峡水利枢纽，就是正在积极进行勘测设计的一个。不久以前，这个工程还曾被人认为是遥远的将来才能考虑的问题，现在根据初步选定的坝址和设想的建筑方案制成的模型，也展览在全国人民面前了。根据模型所示，将来从长江上游滚滚而来的湍急的江水，就将在这里被两百多公尺高的大坝挡住，顺从地在厂房里推动水轮发电机发出强大电流后再引向下游。在河流的左岸将开一道船闸，以便船舶通航。
    长江三峡工程建成后，装机容量将比目前正在建设中的世界上最大的苏联布拉次克水电站还大五、六倍，成为全国电网的中心。
    在积极发展水电的同时，各地为适应迅速增长的电力需要，合理地利用动力资源，还正在建设大量的火力发电厂。今年全国建设的限额以上的大中型火电厂就有一百一十九个。
    县县乡乡都有电
    “大中小并举，全民办电”，这是展览会所表示的我国电力工业得以飞快发展的一个重要因素。
    如果说，第一个五年计划期间我国电力工业只是前电力工业部“独家办”的话，那么展览会上陈列的许多材料证明，现在二十七个省（市、自治区）、二千多个县和几万个乡都在办电，男女老少、城市或乡村也都在动手建设电站。他们所采用的动力资源也是多种多样的，除了水和煤外，还有风力、畜力、瓦斯、石油、潮汐，直到木柴、谷壳、杂草、粪便和污水等等。
    电力馆里的东边靠墙放着两个不大的模型，它们的装璜虽不及大电站的模型漂亮，但是却经常吸引着一大群人们的注意。
  其中一个是天津专区农民创办的安次县大王务乡青年四能联合发电站。这个电站上装有风车、木质水轮机、沼气池、锅驼机四种动力机械，它们共同带动着一部发电机和另一些加工机器。平常有水的时候就用水发电，缺水时就用风发电，如果水和风都没有，就利用沼气或煤气发电。据讲解员说，这种电站不但能常年发电，而且发电成本也很低。现在，天津专区已有很多地方都在推广这种联合电站。
    这仅仅是目前正在蓬勃开展的农村电气化运动中的一个例子。今年上半年全国已经建成的农村水电站就有几千座。今冬明春各省至少将有五个县、一百个农业合作社实现初步电气化。
    在加速农村电气化同时，几百座大中型的水、火电站也在各省统一规划下建立起来。其中仅限额以上的大中型电站就有一百七十七个，它们的设计能力五倍于目前全国所有发电设备能力的总和。
    攀登世界技术的高峰
    在电力馆的西边陈列了很多我国电业职工达到或超过国际水平的发明与创造，它们大多是大跃进中的产物。其中有比北京展览馆的镏金塔尖还高一倍的跨江水泥电线杆，我国独创的万用电缆故障探测器，轻便的变压器间绝缘试验器和厂房框架结构电子计算机等等。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我国建设的大部分现代化电厂还需要苏联帮助设计和施工，但是现在我们不但学会了苏联教给我们的全套技术，而且连比那时建设的电站还大几十倍的丹江口、三峡、五强溪、刘家峡、北京高井等巨型电站，也都可以由自己设计了。电站的建设速度也大大加快了。展览会上对比了三个大型水、火电站的施工期，都比原定计划缩短了一半以上。如发电能力为二十万瓩的北京第一热电厂，去年8月开工，今年9月第一台机组就投入生产。
    电力馆最后有一幅布置得像满天星斗一样的彩色灯光图，描绘了我国电业的美好的前景。不久的将来，在我国辽阔的国土上成百个正在建设和即将建设的大型水利枢纽工程都将落成。这些枢纽和无数个中小型的水、火电站结合在一起，将使密布全国的千川万水驯服地为我们发电灌溉。“南水北调”和“引江济黄”的计划也将实现，使缺水的黄河也能发出强大的电力。同时，随着三峡水利枢纽的建成，全国将联合成统一的电网。在动力资源不足而用电集中的地区，大批原子能和热核能的电站也将建立起来。那时，不论城市或农村，电力就成为人们生产和生活中最普遍的一种动力。黑夜将像白昼一样光明，农民们多少年来梦想的“耕田不用牛，点灯不用油”的图景，也将在全国所有农村中实现。
