Xinhua News Agency Reports: Many British newspapers have expressed serious concern about the tensions provoked by the United States and its puppet Chiang Kai-shek in the Taiwan Strait area. They warn the British government not to support U.S. policy.

    The "Manchester Guardian" stated that the British Foreign Office should tell the United States that Britain "does not participate in Chiang Kai-shek's conflict with Communist China over Kinmen and Matsu Islands." The newspaper emphasized that Britain "has no obligations to Chiang Kai-shek. We (Britain) recognize the Beijing government as the government of China, and the coastal islands are part of Chinese territory."

    The Conservative Party's "Spectator" is uneasy about the U.S. Seventh Fleet stationing off the coast of Taiwan. This weekly magazine demands that the British government not support U.S. policy on China's coastal islands, stating, "Our country believes that Kinmen and Matsu rightfully belong to Communist China."

    The "News Chronicle," which is close to the Liberal Party, stated that most British people disagree with the policy of force pursued by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles. The newspaper demands that the British government not support U.S. policy in the Far East, believing that this policy has long been bankrupt.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, September 7th: British Naval Minister Selkirk declared here on the 6th that Britain will strengthen its naval forces in Hong Kong waters. In a conversation with reporters, he said that Britain's fleet in the Far East "will probably increase in the coming months." The British government feels "uneasy" about China's announcement that it has set its territorial sea width at twelve nautical miles. He also clamored that the development of the situation in the Taiwan Strait is a "very serious event."

　　英国舆论叫政府别当美国帮凶
    英海军大臣竟扬言将要增兵香港
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：英国许多报纸对美国和它的傀儡蒋介石在台湾海峡地区挑起的紧张局势表示严重不安。它们警告英国政府不要支持美国的政策。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”说，英国外交部应该对美国说，英国“不参加蒋介石同共产党中国在金门和马祖岛的冲突”。这家报纸强调指出，英国“对蒋介石没有任何义务。我们（英国）承认北京政府是中国的政府，而沿海岛屿是中国领土的一部分”。
    保守党的“旁观者报”对美国第七舰队驻扎台湾海岸感到不安。这家周刊要求英国政府不要支持美国对中国沿海岛屿的政策，它说：“我们国家认为，金门和马祖照理是共产党中国的一部分”。
    接近自由党的“新闻纪事报”说，大多数英国人民不同意美国国务卿杜勒斯所奉行的武力政策。报纸要求英国政府不要支持美国在远东的政策，报纸认为，因为这个政策早已破产。
    新华社香港7日电　英国海军大臣塞尔扣克6日在这里扬言英国将加强它在香港海面的海军力量。他在对新闻记者发表谈话时说，英国在远东的舰队“在今后几个月中大概会有所增加”。英国政府对中国宣布规定领海宽度为十二浬感到“不安”。他还叫嚷台湾海峡局势发展是一个“非常严重的事件”。
