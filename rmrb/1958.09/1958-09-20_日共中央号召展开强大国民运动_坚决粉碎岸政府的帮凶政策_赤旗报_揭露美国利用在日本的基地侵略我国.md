Xinhua News Agency, September 19th, Tokyo dispatch: According to today's "Red Flag" report, the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Presidium issued a statement on the 18th, calling on all members of the Japanese Communist Party to stand at the forefront of the people and launch a massive national movement to smash the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet's policy of assisting the United States in its aggression against and hostility towards China.

The statement pointed out that since the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Presidium issued a statement on September 3 calling for a movement against US war provocations in the Taiwan Strait area and for the defense of peace, joint actions by various mass organizations, peace organizations, and trade unions in Japan, as well as the Japan Socialist Party and the Japanese Communist Party, are being actively organized.

The statement said that in view of the seriousness of the current situation in the Taiwan Strait, the CCP Central Committee once again calls on all the people to stand up and fight against the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet, which is assisting the US imperialist war policy, while struggling against US imperialism.

The statement pointed out that, according to past lessons, despite the Sino-US ambassadorial talks being held in Warsaw, the United States is increasingly concentrating its armed forces in Taiwan, Okinawa, Japan, and South Korea, and is continuing to carry out armed provocations in Kinmen and Matsu.

The statement said that the Japanese people can no longer tolerate the United States using bases and troops within Japan to launch war provocations against China.

The statement strongly condemned the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for ignoring the memorandum submitted by the Soviet government to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 16th regarding the US use of Japanese territory to provoke China, and pointed out that the Kishida Nobusuke government has consistently supported US imperialist policies of aggression against China in its usual statements and in the Fujiyama-Dulles joint statement. The statement accused the Japanese government and monopoly capital, which made huge profits in the Korean War, of dreaming that US imperialism would launch another war against China in order to make another fortune and are waiting for the arrival of a second economic "boom" of the "Jimmu Boom". The statement pointed out that this is very dangerous for the 90 million Japanese people, and the entire Asian people will absolutely not tolerate them doing so.

The statement pointed out that China today is stronger than it was several years ago, and the Chinese people have already carried out nationwide armament, in addition to the guarantee of full support from the Soviet Union. If US imperialism, the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet, and Japanese monopoly capital forget this fact and the painful lessons of the past Korean War and launch a war against China, the result will only bring a devastating blow to US imperialism.

The statement advocated that it is now necessary to force the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet to stop assisting US war policies; to force it to declare the abolition of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and the "Administrative Agreement", and to prohibit the US military from using bases within Japan; to force it to change its policy of hostility towards China, sever diplomatic relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique; to smash the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet's conspiracy to create "two Chinas"; and to force it to take concrete measures to improve Sino-Japanese relations.

The statement called for all democratic groups and groups from all walks of life, led by the working class, to strengthen united action and launch a massive national movement to resolutely fight the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet to the end in order to achieve the above demands. The statement stated that the Japanese Communist Party agrees with the basic policy on improving Sino-Japanese relations recently published by the Central Committee of the Japan Socialist Party, and advocates that the Socialist Party and the Communist Party must strengthen cooperative relations and work together for the victory of the national movement.

Xinhua News Agency, September 19th dispatch, TASS Tokyo, September 18th dispatch: "Red Flag" continues to prove with facts that the US armed forces are using bases in Japan to carry out aggression in the Taiwan area.

"Red Flag" pointed out that the warnings made by the Soviet government to the Japanese government in the memorandum are well-founded. The newspaper drew attention to the fact that the Americans are using the Iwakuni base. The newspaper wrote that according to existing materials, about 1,800 people from this base participated in the US-Chiang joint military exercise held in southern Taiwan on September 8. The newspaper pointed out that since the US invasion of Lebanon, the US military at the Iwakuni base has been in a state of combat readiness: this is clearly to carry out some kind of secretive activity at the base behind the backs of the public.

    日共中央号召展开强大国民运动
    坚决粉碎岸政府的帮凶政策
    “赤旗报”揭露美国利用在日本的基地侵略我国
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本共产党中央委员会干部会18日发表声明，号召日本共产党全体党员站在人民的前列，展开声势浩大的国民运动，以粉碎岸信介内阁协助美国对中国进行侵略和敌视中国的政策。
    声明指出，自从日本共产党中央委员会干部会在9月3日发表声明呼吁展开反对美国在台湾海峡地区进行战争挑衅和保卫和平的运动以来，日本的各种群众团体、和平组织和工会以及日本社会党和日本共产党的统一行动，正在积极组织中。
    声明说，日共中央鉴于目前台湾海峡地区形势的严重性，再次号召全体人民在与美帝国主义展开斗争的同时，必须站起来同协助美帝国主义战争政策的岸信介内阁展开斗争。
    声明指出，根据过去的经验教训，尽管在华沙正在举行中美大使会谈，但是，美国越来越多地向台湾、冲绳、日本和南朝鲜等地集中它的武装力量，继续在金门和马祖进行武装挑衅。
    声明说，日本人民已经不能再容忍美国利用在日本境内的基地和军队对中国发动战争挑衅。
    声明强烈谴责日本外务省忽视苏联政府16日就美国利用日本领土对中国进行挑衅问题向日本外务省提出的备忘录，并且指出岸信介政府在平时的言论中以及藤山—杜勒斯的联合声明中一贯拥护美帝国主义对中国的侵略政策。声明指责，在朝鲜战争捞得莫大利润的日本政府和垄断资本，梦想美帝国主义对中国再一次发动战争，以便从中再捞一把，并且还等待着第二次经济“繁荣”的“神武景气”的到来。声明指出，对于九千万日本人民这是很危险的，同时亚洲全体人民也绝对不会容忍它们这样做。
    声明指出，中国今天的强大已经不能同数年前相比，并且中国人民已经在进行全民武装，此外还有苏联全面支持的保证，如果美帝国主义和岸信介内阁以及日本垄断资本忘掉了这个事实和过去朝鲜战争的惨痛教训而向中国发动战争，结果只能给美帝国主义招来毁灭性的打击。
    声明主张，现在必须迫使岸信介内阁停止协助美国战争政策；迫使它声明废除日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”，禁止美军使用日本境内的基地；迫使它改变敌视中国的政策，断绝与蒋介石集团的外交关系；粉碎岸信介内阁制造“两个中国”的阴谋；迫使它采取改善日中关系的具体措施。
    声明号召，为了实现上述要求，以工人阶级为主的一切民主团体和各阶层的团体，必须加强统一行动，展开声势浩大的国民运动，坚决地与岸信介内阁斗争到底。声明表示，日本共产党同意日本社会党中央最近发表的关于改善日中关系的基本方针，并且主张社会党和共产党两党必须加强合作关系，共同为国民运动的胜利而努力。
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社东京18日讯：“赤旗报”继续用事实证明美国武装部队利用在日本的基地对台湾地区进行侵略。
    “赤旗报”指出，苏联政府在备忘录中对日本政府提出的警告是有根据的。报纸提请注意美国人正在利用岩国基地。报纸写道，根据现有材料，这个基地约有一千八百人参加了9月8日在台湾南部举行的美蒋联合军事演习。报纸指出，自从美国侵略黎巴嫩以后，岩国基地的美国军队就处于备战状态：这显然是要背着公众在基地进行某种诡秘活动。
