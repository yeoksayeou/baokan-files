Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from New York (TASS, 10th dispatch): Many ordinary Americans have expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. government's policy of military provocations against the People's Republic of China. Readers' letters published in newspapers resolutely demand that the U.S. government stop playing with fire.

    The "New York Times" published a letter from a reader in Iowa, Davis, on the 10th, asking what situation would be created if the United States opened fire. He said that we are utterly fed up with all this "brink of war." New York resident Schenichel wrote that the "Kinmen Island Incident" is the most dangerous of all the U.S. government's blind and adventurous attempts to drag people into the "brink of war." Schenichel said that the United States should not risk war for those islands occupied by "notorious political fugitives" who are delusional about "conquering" mainland China. He wrote, "For us, our interests should be more important than Chiang Kai-shek's fantasies."

    Hokinger, a reader from New Hampshire, wrote, "There is undoubtedly an absurd attempt underway, which is to keep the islands near Xiamen under the rule of a regime hostile to mainland China." Hokinger pointed out that Kinmen and other islands are being used to maintain a "dangerous and unrealistic fantasy of conquering mainland China." He said, "Any government that continues to cling to this absurd plan will be guilty of playing with fire that could lead to national disaster." Hokinger emphasized, "Anyone who stubbornly refuses to acknowledge geographical facts that no one can change cannot escape the charge of acting rashly when the world is facing a serious threat."

    Roosevelt, a reader from California, asked in his letter, "Isn't it time to 'revise' the U.S. policy of getting involved in combat to support Chiang Kai-shek?" He wrote that if war really breaks out due to Dulles' reckless adventurism, the United States is bound to be in a situation where "it will expend its strength and lose its prestige in defending a hopeless cause."

    New York resident Shipler said in a letter: "It is essential that Americans wake up and protest against our stubborn and misguided foreign policy leadership, because Eisenhower and Dulles have their eyes open but cannot see the geographical facts and the development of the situation."

    美国人不愿被杜勒斯推进火炕
    许多人给报纸写信反对政府的战争政策
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社纽约10日讯：许多普通的美国人对美国政府对中华人民共和国的军事挑衅政策表示不满。报刊上刊载的读者来信坚决要求美国政府停止玩火。
    “纽约时报”10日刊载衣阿华州读者戴维斯的一封信说，美国开枪就会造成什么局面呢？他说，我们对所有这些“战争边缘”都感到厌烦透了。纽约居民谢尼切尔写道，“金门岛事件”是美国政府盲目地和冒险地把人们卷入“战争边缘”的一切做法中最危险的一次。谢尼切尔说，美国不应该为了那些被妄想“征服”中国大陆的“臭名远扬的政治逃亡者”所盘踞的岛屿而冒战争的风险。他写道，“对我们来说，我们的利益应该比蒋介石的幻梦更重要一些”。
    新罕布什尔州读者霍金格写道，“眼前无疑有一个荒谬的企图，那就是想使厦门附近的岛屿保持在敌视中国大陆的政权统治之下”。霍金格指出，金门和其他岛屿正被用来维持一个“想征服中国大陆的危险而不现实的幻想”。他说，“任何一个继续抱着这种荒谬打算不放的政府，将负起玩弄使民族遭到灾难的把戏的罪名”。霍金格强调指出，“谁要是硬不承认没有人能改变的地理上的事实，那么当世界面临着严重威胁的时候，他就不能逃脱轻举妄动的罪名”。
    加利福尼亚州的读者罗斯福在信中问道，“修改”美国奉行的为支持蒋介石而卷入战斗的政策的时候“难道不是已经到来了吗”？他写道，如果由于杜勒斯不顾一切进行冒险而使战争真正打起来，那么美国势必处于这样一种情况：“它将为了保卫毫无希望的事业而耗费力量和丧失威信”。
    纽约居民希普勒在信中说：“美国人觉醒过来并且抗议我国顽固不化和错误的外交政策领导是十分必要的，因为艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯睁着眼睛但是却看不到地理事实和事态的发展。”
