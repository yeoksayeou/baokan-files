　　How to Ensure Smooth Iron Tapping from Small Blast Furnaces

How to ensure smooth iron tapping from small blast furnaces? This is a concern for everyone. According to relevant departments, the reasons why small blast furnaces fail to tap iron smoothly are roughly twofold:

　　① Preparations before starting the furnace were not done well, resulting in problems that affected the start-up.

　　② Overeagerness for quick results led to premature iron tapping, resulting in issues due to excessive charging or other reasons.

　　To enable small blast furnaces everywhere to tap iron as soon as possible, several points need attention:

　　1. General characteristics of small blast furnaces: small hearth, low furnace foundation making them highly vulnerable to moisture damage, cold-air start-up, unsuitable blowers (low air pressure and volume), coupled with insufficient baking, excessive charging, and lack of technical and operational experience. Maintaining a high temperature at the bottom of the furnace during start-up is challenging, but difficulties can be overcome.

　　2. Before start-up, the blast furnace and hot-blast stove should be thoroughly dried. Build several large coal-burning stoves around the blast furnace, directing smoke down from the tuyere openings. Generally, this should be done for about three days, with the fire starting small and gradually increasing to avoid cracking the firebricks inside the furnace. Do not completely seal the fire-cleaning door of the hot-blast stove's combustion chamber initially. Before start-up, place firewood in the combustion chamber to burn, starting with a small fire that gradually increases, and continue until coal gas is drawn down and burning after start-up, at which point firewood is no longer needed. Pay special attention to safety when introducing coal gas. After ignition, small blast furnaces should wait for the firewood to burn and produce coke gas before drawing it down to burn the hot-blast stove. Make sure there is an open flame in the hot-blast stove when introducing gas, and initially use a small amount of gas, gradually increasing it after the gas is burning.

　　3. Do a good job of inspection and preparation before starting the furnace, paying particular attention to checking water and air system equipment. For example, tuyere water jackets should be pressure-tested or water-flow tested. Only water jackets that do not leak should be installed and used. The furnace hearth and the inner and outer brick linings of the furnace bottom must be protected from moisture. Therefore, also check the water pipes and furnace belly spray for drips or leaks. For example, the blower should be test-run for several hours, checking the machine for overheating or other problems and the pipe joints for air leaks, then apply yellow mud or refractory mud to the pipe joints. The hot-blast air pressure on the U-shaped glass tube should be around 300-400 millimeters of water column or more. If it is only 30-50 millimeters of water column, it is insufficient.

　　4. When charging the furnace, use approximately 2-inch diameter round or square firewood, laying three or four pieces horizontally and three or four pieces vertically, layer by layer up to the tuyeres, and put half a foot of charcoal on the furnace bottom. The furnace belly should also be fully loaded with firewood (throwing the firewood down one piece at a time from the top of the furnace). Place two to three hundred kilograms of charcoal on top of the firewood, and then load coke and limestone. Do not add ore in the first batch, focusing on heating the furnace until slag is tapped twice after ignition. If the slag is hot and flows well, then start adding ore, five kilograms every ten to twenty batches of material. When the ore reaches one-third of the coke weight, decide whether to add more ore after observing a few batches of iron. It is normal for a small blast furnace to reach its designed production capacity ten days after ignition. If scrap iron is collected, adding it after ignition can speed up the production of pig iron.

　　5. The slag alkalinity should be slightly lower, and the alumina content in the slag should be below 18% to ensure it is not viscous and flows easily. If the ash content of coke or anthracite is too high (above 17%-20%), use charcoal for start-up (charcoal ash content is only 0.5%-2.5%). During start-up, the alumina content in the slag caused by initially loading coke and limestone will be high, the furnace temperature low, and the slag very viscous. Adding a small amount of sand can make the slag flow easily. If possible, adding a small amount of fluorite will further improve the slag fluidity. Fluorite can be discontinued after iron tapping.

　　6. Stuff shavings into the tuyere interiors, pour in a few catties of kerosene during ignition, and insert a red-hot iron rod while simultaneously sending air. The ignition work must ensure that all four tuyeres ignite simultaneously. The tapping hole should be left open to heat the furnace bottom. After slag is seen flowing out, then seal the taphole with a small amount of coke powder mud. If the air inlet appears dark after the firewood is burned, use an iron rod to clear the tuyere and facilitate air entry. In the initial one or two days when iron production is low, the amount of mud used to plug the taphole can be reduced.

　　7. After start-up, frequently tap slag and tap iron. Tap slag every 1-2 hours, and after iron is produced, tap iron and slag every two hours. Avoid shutting off the air blast during the initial start-up period. If the taphole cannot be opened, add more coke and reduce the ore as much as possible, releasing iron from the slag outlet. After the iron accumulated at the bottom of the furnace gradually melts, the taphole can be opened, and then the ore can be gradually increased. If conditions permit, prepare more oxygen cylinders and 6-9 mm diameter black iron pipes to use oxygen to burn open the taphole if it cannot be opened.

　　8. It is best to build the furnace foundation higher above the ground, with round channels left in the foundation to drain water vapor. It is also best to have the refractory bricks lining the furnace bottom be more than 700 millimeters thick, to ensure that the furnace hearth is not affected by moisture and does not solidify.

　　9. The lump size of coke, ore, and limestone used in small blast furnaces should not be too large. Coke should be about 15-50 millimeters (about two inches, slightly larger than an egg), ore 3-20 millimeters (about six fen of a Chinese foot, equivalent to the size of a hawthorn), and limestone 15-30 millimeters (about one inch).

　　The above measures aim to resolve the contradictions of cold and heat, water and fire, during the start-up of small blast furnaces. We hope everyone will add suggestions to ensure that the vast majority of small blast furnaces can tap iron smoothly after start-up.

### 怎样叫小高炉顺利出铁

　　怎样叫小高炉顺利出铁
    怎样叫小高炉顺利出铁？这是大家关心的问题，据有关部门研究，小高炉所以不能出铁，大致有二方面的原因：
    ①开炉前的准备工作没作好，结果临时发生问题影响了开炉；
    ②急于求成，想早出铁，结果由于加料过重或其它原因而影响出铁。
    为使各地小高炉均能及早出铁，有几点事项需要注意：
    1、一般小高炉的特点：炉缸小，高炉基础较低，受水湿危害大，冷风开炉、鼓风机不合适（风压和风量都低）等，加上烤炉不够、配料过重、技术与操作经验缺乏的情况，开炉时保持高炉底部较高温度是有一定的困难，但是困难也是可以克服的。
    2、开炉以前，高炉和热风炉应彻底烤干，在高炉周围砌几个烧煤火的大炉灶，烟囱从风口眼往下倒烟，一般应烤三天左右，火力要先小，逐步加大以避免炉内火砖开裂。热风炉燃烧室的清火门先不砌死，开炉前放木柴在燃烧室里燃烧，火力也要先小后大，一直到开炉后引下煤气烧着以后才不烧木柴。在引煤气时，要特别注意安全。小高炉在开炉点火后，待木柴烧完产生焦炭煤气后再引下来烧热风炉。引煤气时热风炉内一定要有明火，开始引煤气时煤气要少一些，待煤气烧着后再逐渐增多。
    3、做好开炉前的检查准备工作，特别要注意检查水与风的系统设备，如：风口水套应先试压或通水试验，不印水和滴漏的水套才能安装使用。高炉炉缸与炉底内外砖衬应保证不受水湿，因此，也要检查水管与炉腹喷水有无滴水或漏水情况。又如：鼓风机应试运转数小时，检查机器有无发热等毛病和管道接头有无漏风现象，然后在管接头上抹黄泥或耐火泥。∪形玻璃管上的热风风压应有300—400公厘左右水柱或更多。如果只有三、五十公厘水柱就显得不够。
    4、装料时用2市寸左右圆木柴或方木柴横摆三、四根，直摆三、四根，一层一层架至风口，并在炉底放半尺厚木炭；炉腹也要满装木柴（从炉顶一块一块木柴扔下去）；在木柴上面放二、三百公斤木炭，然后再装焦炭与石灰石，头一炉料不加矿石，着重烤热炉子，直到点火后出两次渣，如果渣热、流动好，才开始加矿石，每隔十到二十批料加矿石五公斤，当矿石加至焦炭重量的三分之一时，应看几炉铁以后，再决定添不添矿石，小高炉点火十天后达到设计产量可算是正常的现象。如果收集到碎废铁，在点火后加废铁可早见生铁。
    5、炉渣碱度要配小些，渣内含二氧化铝应在18％以下，以保证它不稠，易于流出，如果焦炭或白煤含灰分太高（17％—20％以上），应改用木炭开炉（木炭灰分只有0.5％—2.5％）。开炉时因最初都是装的焦炭及石灰石，所造成的炉渣中三氧化二铝的含量高，炉子温度低，渣很稠，可加入少量砂子，渣就可以容易流出来，如有可能再加入少量萤石，渣子流动性就更好，萤石在出铁后，可以不加。
    6、在风口内部塞入刨花，点火时灌几斤火油，同时插入烧红的铁钎，然后送风，点火工作要保证四处同时燃着。出铁口应敞开，使炉底烤热些。直到见渣流出时，再用少量焦末泥堵口。在点火木柴烧完后，进风口如发暗色，应用铁钎通风口，可以疏通风口使风容易打进去。在第一、二天出铁不多的情况下，堵铁口用泥量可以少一些。
    7、开炉后应勤打铁口出渣出铁，每隔1—2小时出一次渣，有铁以后，每隔二小时出一次铁和渣，开炉初期要避免休风。如铁口打不开，可改加空焦炭及尽量减少矿石，由渣口放铁，待炉底积铁逐步熔化后，铁口即可打开，然后再逐步增矿石。如条件可能时，可再多准备几瓶氧气及6—9公厘直径的黑铁管，在铁口打不开时，可使用氧气烧开。
    8、建设高炉时基础最好高出地面，基础内留有圆孔道排泄水汽，炉底耐火砖砌七百公厘以上厚较好，这样才能保证炉缸不受水湿影响结底。
    9、小高炉用的焦炭、矿石、石灰石块度均不要太大，焦炭约15—50公厘（约合二市寸左右，较鸡蛋稍大即可），矿石3—20公厘（约合市尺六分左右，相当于山楂大小）石灰石15—30公厘（约合一市寸左右）。
    以上措施是要解决小高炉开炉时冷和热，水和火的矛盾，希望大家补充意见，做到绝大部分小高炉开炉顺利出铁。
