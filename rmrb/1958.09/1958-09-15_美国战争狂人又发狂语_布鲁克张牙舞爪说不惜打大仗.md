Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: American Army Secretary Brooke issued war cries in Guam today, saying that the American armed forces are in a state of "combat readiness" and will stubbornly remain in Taiwan.

    Brooke also boasted about the so-called "huge striking power" of the American army. He clamored that the United States is "ready to fight a major war or a local war."

    This American Army Secretary, who recently visited various parts of the Far East for war planning, was on his way back to the United States from Manila today when he passed through Guam.

    During his two-day stay in Manila, he held secret talks with Philippine President Garcia.

    According to Garcia, Brooke mentioned that the United States is helping the Chiang Kai-shek clique "replenish supplies" to its troops in Kinmen.

    Garcia also said that any action by the United States to establish missile bases in the Philippines must be approved by the Philippines.

    Meanwhile, U.S. Pacific Forces Commander Felt arrived in Manila on September 11th from Guam. He will stay in the Philippines for four days and then go to Bangkok to attend the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) military advisors conference. Felt also made war cries in Manila and held talks with Garcia.

    It is revealed that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting will also discuss the situation in the Taiwan Strait.

    A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense also clamored on the 13th that the United States is strengthening its threat to China and actively preparing for war in the Far East. He said that the American troops in the Taiwan area have increased somewhat. The American troops in the Far East have sufficient ammunition to fight any conventional war. The spokesman also said that the United States is "now shipping many kinds of replenishment supplies" to the Far East, including ammunition.

    美国战争狂人又发狂语
    布鲁克张牙舞爪说不惜打大仗
    据新华社13日讯　美国陆军部长布鲁克今天在关岛发出战争叫嚣说，美国武装部队已经处在“作战准备状态”中，并且将赖在台湾“不动”。
    布鲁克还吹嘘美国军队的所谓“巨大打击力量”。他叫嚣说，美国已经“准备好进行大战或者局部战争”。
    这个最近访问远东各地作战争策划的美国陆军部长今天是从马尼拉回美国的途中路经关岛的。
    他在马尼拉逗留两天的时候，曾经同菲律宾总统加西亚进行秘密会谈。
    据加西亚透露，布鲁克曾经谈到：美国正在帮助蒋介石集团给它在金门的军队“补充供应品”。
    加西亚还说，美国在菲律宾建立导弹基地的任何行动都必须得到菲律宾的同意。
    同时，美国驻太平洋部队总司令费耳特在9月11日从关岛到了马尼拉，他将在菲律宾逗留四天，然后去曼谷参加东南亚条约组织军事顾问会议。费耳特也在马尼拉作了战争叫嚣，并且同加西亚进行了会谈。
    据透露，东南亚条约组织会议也将讨论有关台湾海峡局势的问题。
    美国国防部的一个发言人在13日也叫嚷美国加强对中国的威胁在远东积极备战。他说，台湾地区的美国军队有了某些增加。远东的美国军队弹药充足，可以打任何常规的战争。这个发言人还说，美国“现在正在运去（远东）许多种类补充供应品”，其中包括弹药。
