Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd:  A brand-new scene of local industries scattered like stars and blooming everywhere has appeared in many minority areas across the country. The rapid development of local industries is causing significant changes in the economic landscape of these regions.

Minority areas have abundant industrial resources, but their industrial base is very weak, and some ethnic groups did not even have handicrafts in the past. This historical backwardness has further stimulated ethnic minorities to attack the industrial front at an astonishing speed. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the number of factories and mines run by the masses was only 2,200 at the beginning of July, but by August 15th, it had surged to more than 112,000. The Oroqen hunters in the Greater Khingan Mountains, who have just begun to settle down, have also worked hard for two months to build brick and tile factories and dairy factories. In the three special districts of Baise, Liuzhou, and Yongning, where ethnic minorities gather in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, more than 276,000 small factories and mines were built and put into production in the hundred days from late April to the end of July. Yunnan Province expects its industrial output value to increase by 150% to 200% this year compared to last year, while the industrial output value of the ethnic autonomous prefectures of Honghe, Dehong, and Wenshan is expected to increase by about 400% to 600% compared to last year. In Sichuan Province, industrial flowers are blooming from Erlang Mountain to the Jinsha River; the Yi people in the Liangshan area, who have just been liberated from slavery, will also establish more than 800 factories and mines this year. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is vigorously developing petroleum, steel, machinery manufacturing, and textile industries, and a prosperous scene of towering chimneys and roaring machines will appear in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains.

Many minority areas are concentrating their efforts on building steel and machinery industries, setting off a magnificent national movement. In the Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang autonomous regions, small blast furnaces and converters are constantly being built, and some have already produced molten iron and molten steel. In Guizhou Province, 31 counties and cities in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture have built more than 800 indigenous blast furnaces. Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province, where industrial output value reached more than 75% of the total industrial and agricultural output value as early as 1957, pays special attention to the development of the steel industry, which did not exist in the past. The 20 iron-smelting plants built in five counties and one city will soon be put into production one after another.

In the Great Leap Forward in industry, various ethnic minorities have relied on their own efforts to manufacture many products that their ethnic groups have never produced before, which has strongly supported agricultural and animal husbandry production. The factories and mines in Liuzhou Prefecture, Guangxi, alone have produced more than 220,000 various agricultural tools and more than 1.48 million tons of indigenous fertilizer and granular fertilizer, which played an important role in this year's bumper rice harvest. Some ethnic groups in Yunnan Province, who originally practiced "slash-and-burn cultivation," have unprecedentedly made plowshares and tractors themselves. The spiral pumps made by the Wuzhong Machinery Repair Plant in Ningxia have solved the irrigation problems in Jinyin Beach and other places.

### 各兄弟民族大办工业猛攻钢铁  加速开发少数民族地区

    各兄弟民族大办工业猛攻钢铁
　　加速开发少数民族地区
    据新华社3日讯　全国许多少数民族地区出现了地方工业星罗棋布、遍地开花的崭新局面。地方工业的迅速发展，正在促使这些地区的经济面貌发生重大变化。
    少数民族地区有着丰富的工业资源，但工业基础十分薄弱，有的民族过去连手工业都没有。这种历史上遗留下来的落后状态，更加激发少数民族在工业战线上以惊人的速度向前猛攻。内蒙古自治区群众办的厂矿，在7月初还只有二千二百个，到8月15日就激增到十一万二千多个。大兴安岭开始定居下来的鄂伦春族猎民，也苦干两个月建成了砖瓦厂、乳品厂。在广西僮族自治区少数民族聚居的百色、柳州、邕宁等三个专区，从4月下旬到7月底的一百天当中，就有二十七万六千多座小型厂矿建成，投入生产。云南省今年工业产值比去年预计增长一倍半到两倍，而红河、德宏、文山等民族自治州的工业产值，大约都比去年猛增四倍到六倍。四川省从二郎山到金沙江边盛开工业之花；凉山地区刚从奴隶制度下解放出来的彝族人民，今年也要创办八百多个厂矿。新疆维吾尔自治区正在大闹石油、钢铁、机械制造和纺织工业，天山南北将要出现烟囱林立、机器轰鸣的繁荣景象。
    许多少数民族地区集中力量建设钢铁、机械工业，掀起了一个规模壮阔的全民运动。在内蒙古、新疆等自治区小高炉及转炉正在不断建立起来，有些已经流出了铁水、钢水。贵州省黔南布依族苗族自治州和黔东南苗族侗族自治州的三十一个县、市，已建成八百多个土高炉。工业产值早在1957年就达到工农业总产值75％以上的吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州，特别注意发展过去所没有的钢铁工业，五县一市兴建的二十个炼铁厂，即将先后投入生产。
    在工业大跃进中，各少数民族自力更生，制造出了许多本民族历史上从来没有生产过的产品，有力地支援了农牧业生产。仅广西柳州专区的厂矿，就制出各式农具二十二万多件，土化肥和颗粒肥料一百四十八万多吨，对今年水稻大丰收起了重要的作用。云南省一些原来“刀耕火种”的民族，破天荒地自制出犁铧、拖拉机了。宁夏地区吴忠机器修配厂制成的螺旋式抽水机，解决了金银滩等地的灌溉问题。
