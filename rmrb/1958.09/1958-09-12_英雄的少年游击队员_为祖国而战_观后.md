    Heroic Young Guerrilla
    ——After Seeing “Fight for the Motherland”
　  Chen Anjing
    We haven't seen many Korean films, but they are all full of fighting spirit. These films depict the heroic struggle of the Korean people against imperialist aggressors, their difficulties, hopes, confidence, and strength in the struggle. The film "Fight for the Motherland" once again reproduces those heroic deeds, leaving us with a deep impression.
    The film depicts a story from the Anti-Japanese War. The protagonist, Choi Ho-cheol, is a fourteen-year-old Korean boy, but the life he has experienced and the contributions he has made in the guerrilla war far exceed his age. His parents both sacrificed themselves in the struggle to join the guerrillas. He was brought to the Children's Revolutionary Corps by the old guerrilla fighter Park Hoon, and with a strong desire for revenge, he demanded to join the guerrillas to avenge his parents. The struggle made him understand even more that hitting and eliminating the enemy was not just to avenge his parents, but for the people and for national liberation, that is, to fight for the motherland. This growth of Choi Ho-cheol can be seen from a conversation after the victory of the Sandaogou battle:
    The captain led Ho-cheol as he walked and said, "Ho-cheol, have you avenged your father and mother?"
    Ho-cheol: "I have, I killed five devils."
    Captain: "You have avenged your father and mother, so you can leave the guerrillas now."
    Ho-cheol: "No! I will not leave the guerrillas, I will also avenge all my compatriots."
    I think this is exactly what the film wants to tell the audience. But what the film gives us is not just these. From the narrative of Ho-cheol's growth process, from the description of the guerrilla warfare, we see the close ties between the Chinese and Korean people, the fighting friendship established between the two peoples in the struggle against the common enemy - Japanese imperialism, and the destructive blow given to the enemy by the Korean guerrillas under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung.
    The film has been relatively successful in shaping the image of the little hero Choi Ho-cheol, portraying him as having both the heroic spirit of a soldier and the innocent and lovely character of a child. From the scene when he put down his firewood and didn't chop it for the first time they met, but caught fish in the clear river, from his interesting talk of "...the sea has no edge, a piece of blue looks better and better," and his actions of running to find the guerrilla captain alone without the principal's approval, all fully show the pure heart of a teenager. But from his angry facial expression after being beaten, silently cooking after his mother disappeared, especially the many intelligent behaviors in the reconnaissance activities later, it shows that under the education and training of the Party and his elders, he already has the qualities of a qualified soldier.
    The description of guerrilla life is also relatively true and moving. The soldiers' high fighting will, high revolutionary optimism, and mutual care and help between comrades all make people feel very kind. Especially the care for the young guerrillas is meticulous, vividly reflecting the loving fighting life of the guerrillas.
    Although the period depicted in the film is relatively long ago, the glorious achievements of the Korean people in the battle deserve to be written about in detail. Especially when American imperialism is rampantly provoking in the Far East today, the significance of the film's release is not only to make us understand the past of the Korean people's arduous struggle, but it will become a powerful weapon to encourage the people to resolutely oppose the aggressors.

    英雄的少年游击队员
    ——“为祖国而战”观后
  　陈安京
    我们看过的朝鲜影片不算多，但都充满战斗气息。这些影片表现了朝鲜人民反抗帝国主义侵略者的英勇斗争、他们在斗争中的困难、希望、信心和力量。影片“为祖国而战”又一次再现了那些可歌可泣的英雄事迹，给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    影片描写的是抗日战争时期的故事。主人公崔浩哲是个年仅十四岁的朝鲜少年，但是他所经历的生活和在游击战争中所作出的贡献，却远远超过了他的年龄。他的父母都在参加游击队的斗争中先后牺牲了，他被老游击队员朴勋带到了儿童革命团，并且怀着强烈的复仇心情要求参加游击队，为父母报仇。斗争使他更加懂得了打击和消灭敌人不仅仅是为了给父母报仇，而是为了人民、为了民族解放，也就是要为祖国而战。从三道沟战斗胜利结束后的一场谈话可以看出崔浩哲的这种成长：
    队长领着浩哲边走边说：“浩哲，爸爸和妈妈的仇报了吧？”
    浩哲：“报了，我杀了五个鬼子。”
    队长：“你把父亲和母亲的仇都报了，那你现在可以离开游击队啦。”
    浩哲：“不！我不离开游击队，我还要给所有的同胞们报仇。”
    我觉得这正是影片所要告诉观众的。但是影片所给予我们的还不只是这些，从浩哲成长过程的叙述中，从游击队战斗的描写里，我们看到了中朝人民唇齿相关的血肉关系，两国人民在反抗共同的敌人——日本帝国主义者的斗争中所建立起来的战斗友谊，以及朝鲜游击队在金日成将军的领导下给予敌人歼灭性的打击。
    影片比较成功地塑造了小英雄崔浩哲的形象，刻划出他既有战士的英雄气魄，又具有孩子似的天真的可爱性格。从第一次见面他放下柴不打而在清澈的江水中抓鱼的情景，从他有趣的谈着“……大海没有边儿，一片蓝色儿越看越好看的时候”，以及他未经校长批准便独自跑去找游击队长的行动中，都十足地表现了一个少年纯真的心。但是从他挨打后愤怒的面部表情，母亲失踪后自己默默地煮饭，特别是后来在侦察活动中许多机智的行为，又显露出他在党和长辈的教育和培养下，已经具有合格的战士的品质。
    对于游击队生活的描写，也比较真实和动人。战士们高昂的战斗意志，高度的革命乐观主义精神，以及同志间相互关怀和帮助，都使人感到十分亲切。特别是对年小的游击队员的照顾，更是无微不至，生动地反映了游击队充满友爱的战斗生活。
    虽然影片所描写的距离现在已经比较久了，但朝鲜人民在战斗中的光荣业迹是值得大书特书的。尤其是当美帝国主义在远东猖狂挑衅的今天，影片上映的意义就不再单是使我们了解朝鲜人民艰苦斗争的过去，而将会成为鼓舞人民坚决反对侵略者的有力武器。
