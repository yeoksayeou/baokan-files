People's Commentary

　　Critique of "Footsteps of Youth"
　　Uproot the White Flag in Film Creation
    Hearing the name "Footsteps of Youth," one would guess that this must be a film reflecting the progressive steps of our era, encouraging people to move forward. However, after watching it, I felt extremely angry! What the heck. What kind of footsteps of youth are these! Where does it lead the audience onto the right path? Where does it reflect the vigorous spirit of our era? The bourgeois lifestyle and bourgeois thoughts and feelings permeate this film. It deliberately flaunts the petty bourgeois coquettishness and shameless low-level tastes, leading people into a low and lingering mood. The film depicts intellectuals, but it does so from a bourgeois perspective, with not a trace of socialist atmosphere. Not only are the working people unwilling to watch it, but even those of us intellectuals who are willing to thoroughly reform ourselves feel disgusted after watching it! It seems that the director has put a lot of effort into some of the expressions and techniques, especially for the film's heroine, Meilan, a bourgeois spoiled miss, and her alluring low-level tastes. Perhaps this is because the director has deep experience and feelings in this regard! However, we must shout loudly at him: This is an old bourgeois tune! It superficially condemns the morally corrupt behavior of the bourgeoisie, but in reality, it adds fuel to the fire of the bourgeois lifestyle. "Footsteps of Youth" is a white flag in film creation. Today, white flags are being uprooted and red flags are being planted on all fronts. We must not allow this white flag in the film industry to continue to flutter! Uprooting the white flag in the film industry not only depends on film workers, but more importantly, it depends on the broad masses!

　　评“青春的脚步”
　　拔掉电影创作里的白旗
    听到名字是“青春的脚步”，猜想这一定是一部反映我们时代前进步伐、鼓舞人前进的影片。但是，看完之后，十分气愤！活见鬼。这是什么青春的脚步啊！它哪里是把观众往正路上引呢？哪里反映了我们时代的蓬勃气概呢？资产阶级的生活方式、资产阶级的思想情感浸透了这部电影，它有意卖弄资产阶级的撒娇无赖的低级趣味，把人们引到一种低沉缠绵的情调中去。影片描写的是知识分子，但却是从资产阶级的角度来描写的，闻不出一点社会主义的气息。不仅劳动人民不愿看它，就连我们愿意彻底改造自己的知识分子看了它也感到心中作呕！看来，导演在一些表现形式和技巧上花费了许多心血，特别是对于影片的女主人公——美兰，一个资产阶级的娇小姐和她那妖媚的低级趣味作了很多渲染，这也许是因为导演在这方面体验很深、颇有感触的缘故吧！但是，我们要向他大喝一声：这是资产阶级老调调！它表面上是谴责资产阶级道德败坏的行为，实际上却是为资产阶级的生活方式添油加醋。“青春的脚步”是电影创作里的一面白旗，今天，各个战线上都在拔白旗、插红旗，我们决不能让电影界中的这面白旗继续飘扬！电影界中的白旗，不仅要依靠电影工作者去拔，更重要的是要依靠广大群众去拔！
