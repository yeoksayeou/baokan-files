　　(I) Thousands of troops and horses march into the mountains
　　 To vigorously develop iron and steel smelting
　　Mountains are full of ore, all of which are gems
　　A paradise is built by the valley stream
　　Millions of chimneys stand like forests
　　Tens of millions of iron furnaces spark
　　Molten iron surpasses the Yangtze River
　　Steel piles up higher than Mount Tai
　　Men, women, old and young all work together
　　Reddening half the sky of Yuxian

　　(II) Steel industry must be greatly developed
　　Go up the mountain to find ore raw materials
　　Heroes are not afraid of heat and cold
　　Learn from the Red Army to climb snow mountains
　　If there is none on the mountain, dig underground
　　If there is none on the ground, scoop it from the river
　　We are not afraid of thousands of difficulties
　　Completing the task is the top priority
