    Deduced from Fish's Words
    Chi Di
    According to reports: Republican Congressman Fish, who served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee for twenty-two years, spoke about the U.S. government's hawkish policies. He said that the U.S.'s war provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait were "utterly stupid" and "unjustified." He said, "Ninety percent of the American people are against the U.S. getting involved in a nuclear war." He said he opposed the U.S.'s "diplomacy of empty threats, roaring, and futile interference," because "this policy only drives many countries and peoples into the embrace of communism." Moreover, he also "opposed a suicidal nuclear war with Soviet Russia" and "hoped to ban the use of all types of nuclear weapons."
    It should be pointed out that the speaker is not as "unbiased" as he claims. He stated at the outset: "No American is more consistently opposed to world communism than I am." Moreover, his opposition to the U.S. government's interventionist policies is only because such policies "drive many countries and peoples into the embrace of communism" and he fears the U.S. "flirting with the atomic grim reaper" and "committing suicide."
    We can temporarily ignore his prejudice and first look at what else we can easily deduce from this person's words: First, if a person with anti-communist prejudice is like this, then how resolutely should unbiased Americans oppose the U.S. government's aggressive policies? Second, even a person who "served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee for twenty-two years" has risen up to oppose U.S. foreign policy, then how many people in the United States must oppose the government's foreign policy!
    Then, didn't these words unintentionally give the self-aggrandizing Dulles a resounding slap in the face?

    从菲希的话里推出来的
    迟地
    报载：美国共和党众议员、曾在众议院外交委员会服务过二十二年的菲希，谈到了美国政府的好战政策。他说美国在台湾海峡对中国的战争挑衅行为是“愚蠢透顶的”，“是没有道理的”。他说：“美国人民百分之九十是反对美国卷入核战争的。”他说他反对美国的“虚声恫吓、咆哮、进行徒然的干涉的外交政策”，因为“这种政策只是驱使许多国家和人民投入共产党怀抱”。而且，他还“反对同苏俄进行自杀性的核战争”。“希望禁止使用一切类型的核武器”。
    应该指明，说话的人并不像他自称的那样，“不带偏见”。他一开初就曾声明：“在始终一贯反对世界共产主义方面，美国人中间谁也比不上我。”而且，他的反对美国政府的干涉主义政策，也只是因为这种政策“驱使许多国家和人民投入共产党怀抱”和害怕美国同“原子死神勾勾搭搭”而“自杀”。
    我们可以暂且不管他的这种偏见，先来看看从这个人的话里，还可以使我们不费力气地推知一些什么东西：一、具有反共偏见的人尚且如此，那么不具偏见的美国人该是如何坚决地反对美国政府的侵略政策；二、连“在众院外交委员会里服务了二十二年”的人都起来反对美国的外交政策了，那么在美国，反对政府外交政策的人该有多少呵！
    那末，这些话不是无意中给了自吹自擂的杜勒斯一记清脆的耳光吗？
