Everyone is a Laborer, Everyone is a Student
Changchun Factories Establish 158 Schools of Various Forms

(By our newspaper) A surge of school establishment is sweeping through factories and enterprises in Changchun. As of September 20th, factories throughout the city have established a total of 158 various types of worker schools, with 72,384 workers enrolled. A worker education network spanning from primary school to university, from spare-time to semi-work-study, and from cultural education to technical education, is taking shape.

There are four forms of factory-run schools in Changchun: The first is the spare-time cultural and technical school for workers. This type of school is the most numerous, with 104 schools, accounting for 65.7% of the total number of worker schools in the city. The characteristic is to use spare time for learning, studying politics, culture, and technology, three types of courses, three to four times a week, two hours each time. The second is various types of worker semi-work-study schools (classes). At present, thirteen factories in the city have established this type of worker semi-work-study school (class), with 1,969 workers enrolled. The largest is the worker semi-work-study school run by Hengli Cotton Mill, with 350 workers participating in semi-work-study, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of workers in the factory. Workers participating in this type of school spend two to four hours of working time each day studying. The third is the factory-run university. Following the establishment of the Chemical Engineering College by the Gas Company, fourteen more factories in the city have established universities of various specialized natures on the basis of the original spare-time cultural and technical schools for workers, such as the Paper-Making College, the Mechanical Engineering College, the Electrical Engineering College, and the Electrical Machinery and Metallurgical College. The characteristics of this type of school are: spare-time and semi-work-study coexist simultaneously; each college has established a research department (institute) specifically for veteran workers; and a three-level system (advanced, intermediate, primary) or a two-department system (undergraduate, preparatory) is implemented according to the educational level of the workers. This form of school has a national character. It can absorb everyone from veteran workers to apprentices, from primary school level to university level, from factory directors and engineers to ordinary workers, truly embodying "everyone is a laborer, everyone is a student." This type of school can also combine production, education, and scientific research, so that theory and practice are highly integrated. At present, these types of schools are carrying out teaching reforms on the basis of the original spare-time schools for workers. For example, the Jiamai Can Factory's Mechanical Engineering College will change the original eight-year term from higher primary school to high school to a five-year continuous system; the Gas Company's Chemical Engineering College will merge junior high school and high school into a four-year continuous system. The fourth is various secondary vocational schools and technical schools affiliated to factories that mainly enroll primary and secondary school graduates. There are a total of twenty-two such schools, with 8,752 students. All implement semi-work-study. As a reserve labor force for factories. After graduation, under the principle of national needs and students' own volition, they can directly enter factories as technicians, technical staff, or be promoted to universities.

With the continued deepening of the cultural revolution, factory-run schools are currently developing vigorously in Changchun, and various forms of worker schools will become more enriched and complete. There are great benefits to factories running schools: First, they can cultivate worker-class intellectuals in large numbers, quickly and effectively. In recent years, due to the Gas Company's adherence to worker education, forty-three leading cadres have been promoted from among the workers in four years, eighteen of whom were illiterate in the past and have now reached the level of technicians and engineers. Second, it can promote the further development of the technological revolution. After the establishment of the Asbestos Workers' College by the Asbestos Factory, the preliminary successful research on water-soluble colloid by the veteran workers in the research department has promoted production. Now almost all the workers in the factory are involved in the wave of learning and scientific research. Third, it can promote continuous leaps forward in production. The Gas Company originally planned to complete the coking task this year, but due to the level coking method researched by the veteran worker students in the research department of the Chemical Engineering College of the factory, it can now not only be completed on schedule, but also be completed ahead of schedule. Fourth, it can accelerate the popularization of higher education for workers. After the establishment of the Paper-Making College by Changchun Paper Mill, after teaching reform, it was proposed to popularize higher education among existing workers in eight years.

### 人人是劳动者　人人是学生  长春各工厂办起一百五十八所各种形式的学校

    人人是劳动者　人人是学生
    长春各工厂办起一百五十八所各种形式的学校
    本报讯　长春市各工厂企业掀起大办学校的热潮。截至9月20日止，全市各工厂共办起一百五十八所各种职工学校，入学职工七万二千三百八十四人。一个从小学到大学，从业余到半工半读，从文化教育到技术教育的职工教育网正在形成。
    长春市工厂办学的有四种形式：第一种是职工业余文化技术学校。这一类学校最多，共一百零四所，占全市职工学校总数的65.7％。特点是利用业余时间学习，学习政治、文化、技术三类课程，每周学习三到四次，每次二小时。第二种是各类工人半工半读学校（班）。现在全市共有十三个工厂举办了这种工人半工半读学校（班），入学职工一千九百六十九人。其中最大的是恒利棉纺厂办的工人半工半读学校，有三百五十名职工参加半工半读，占该厂职工总数的80％以上。参加这类学校学习的职工每天抽出二到四小时的工作时间学习。第三种是工厂办的大学。继煤气公司创办化工学院之后，全市又有十四个工厂，在原有职工业余文化技术学校的基础上成立了各种专业性质的大学，如造纸学院、机械学院、电机学院、电气机械冶金学院等，这类学校的特点是：业余和半工半读同时并存；每个学院都专为老工人设立了研究部（所）；根据职工文化程度，实行三级制（高级、中级、初级）或二科制（本科、预科）。这种形式的学校具有全民性质，它能吸收从老工人到徒工，从小学程度到大学程度，从厂长、工程师到普通工人入学，真正体现了“人人是劳动者，人人是学生”。这类学校还能使生产、教育、科学研究三方面结合起来，使理论和实践高度结合起来。目前这类学校正在原有职工业余学校的基础上，进行教学改革，如加美制罐厂机械学院将原来从高小到高中，需要八年的学期，改为五年一贯制；煤气公司化工学院合并初、高中为四年一贯制。第四种是工厂附设的以招收中小学毕业生为主要对象的各种中等专业学校和技工学校。这一类学校共有二十二所，学生八千七百五十二名。全部实行半工半读。做为工厂劳动后备力量。毕业后在国家需要和学生本人自愿的原则下，可以直接入工厂当技工、技术员或升入大学。
    随着文化革命继续深入，长春市目前工厂办学校正在蓬勃发展，各种形式的职工学校将会更加充实更加完备。工厂办学校的好处很大：第一能大量地迅速而有效地培养工人阶级知识分子。煤气公司几年来由于坚持了职工教育，四年期间从工人中共提拔了四十三名领导干部，其中有十八名过去是文盲，现在已达到技术员和工程师的水平。第二能促进技术革命进一步开展。石棉厂成立石棉工学院之后，由于研究部里的老工人初步研究成功水溶胶，对生产起了推动作用。现在全厂职工几乎全部卷入学习和科学研究的浪潮中来。第三能推动生产不断跃进。煤气公司原计划今年完成的炼焦任务，由于该厂化工学院研究部的老工人学员研究出来的水平炉炼焦方法，现在不仅能按期完成，而且能提前完成。第四，能够更快的普及职工高等教育。长春造纸厂成立造纸学院以后，经过教学改革，提出在现有职工中，用八年的时间普及高等教育。
