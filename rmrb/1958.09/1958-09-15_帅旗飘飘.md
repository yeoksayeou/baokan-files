　　Chairman Mao said: "With grain and steel, we have everything."

(I)

　　Stepping into the Metallurgy Pavilion, we were immediately filled with a strong, combative passion: facing us was a bas-relief of a steel ladle pouring molten steel, boiling and bursting with orange-red flames; behind the statue of a burly, spirited metallurgical worker, stood majestic models of giant steel ingots and silver giant aluminum ingots; a red arrow rapidly soaring upwards signified the determination of thousands upon thousands of metallurgical workers: they must increase steel production from 5.35 million tons to 10.7 million tons this year, with corresponding increases in pig iron production, a 135% increase in copper production compared to last year, and a 73% increase in aluminum production...

　　We stood in front of a huge chart, gazing at it for a long time. It told us that steel is the marshal's banner of our socialist construction. With steel, there are smelting equipment, machine tools, advanced industries such as electronic computers, atomic reactors, and radar, and pioneering industries such as power stations, trains, automobiles, airplanes, and ships, as well as drilling rigs, tractors, textile machines...

　　Today, our marshal's banner has been raised high. Our country has already produced more than 400 kinds of steel and more than 4,000 kinds of steel products. The alloy steel and steel products needed by various departments can mostly be self-sufficient. The birth of the 43-ton large steel ingot and the 6-meter-high, 1.5-meter-wide large aluminum ingot clearly marked that our country's industry had reached a higher level.

　　Today, our marshal's banner has been planted all over the country. Look! Those scattered points on the national metallurgical industry distribution map this year are an exciting and inspiring good game of chess for our country's metallurgical industry. By the end of this year, a total of 455 large, medium, and small metallurgical factories and mines will be built and continue to be built across the country, including 215 iron and steel plants and mines, and 240 non-ferrous metal plants and mines. Among these 400+ metallurgical plants and mines, 42 are large-scale and are the backbone for the development of the metallurgical industry. The thousands upon thousands of indigenous blast furnaces and small converters scattered all over the country are not included. It can be seen that this year's metallurgical industry game of chess has been set, and victory is within grasp.

　　Seeing these moving exhibits, people cannot help but recall the past and feel proud of the great achievements of our country's metallurgical industry. From the establishment of the Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant by Zhang Zhidong in 1890 to the nearly 60 years before liberation, old China produced only 7.6 million tons of steel; we started from scratch on a dilapidated foundation and produced 19.61 million tons of steel in eight years. During the First Five-Year Plan, the development speed of steel, copper, and aluminum in our country far exceeded that of all capitalist countries. For example, for steel, our country increased sharply by an average of 31.7% per year, while the United States only increased by 3.7% and the United Kingdom by 3.9%.

(II)

　　The exhibition vividly tells people that our country's metallurgical industry construction has undergone a great revolution this year. In the past, only a few people were involved. Today, it has become a magnificent mass movement in which the entire country acts together, from top to bottom. The Party's general line for socialist construction, like a beacon, illuminates people's thoughts, and the secrets of metallurgy have been revealed. Please look at these photos: mechanical workers producing pot-bellied boilers in Shandong, farmers in the mountainous areas of Hebei, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army guarding the front lines in Fujian, young students in Beijing, and commercial salespersons in Liaoning Province—these yesterday's mechanical workers, farmers, soldiers, students, and merchants, who have never smelted steel before, are now operating in front of the golden and brilliant iron-smelting, steel-making, and copper-smelting furnaces, becoming metallurgical workers.

　　This is the main reason why the flower of the metallurgical industry has bloomed all over the country in just a few months. For example, in the Southwest region, the people of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou have put forward the heroic pledge of seeking copper and steel from the high mountains and ridges, and hundreds of thousands of labor troops have rushed to the metallurgical front. The three provinces help and cooperate with each other, and this year the output of pig iron, steel, and copper will increase several times compared to last year.

　　We saw at the exhibition that large, medium, and small, "foreign" and "indigenous" metallurgical enterprises are shining brightly and showing their power on the steel front, fighting day and night.

　　The model of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise, which is being accelerated in construction, is exhibited at the conference as a representative of large-scale enterprises. Not long ago, I visited this construction site, which was boiling day and night. It is equipped with the world's first-class equipment and technology; after completion, it can produce a large number of various large steel products, steel pipes, and steel plates; the No. 1 blast furnace, which has already produced iron ahead of schedule, produces enough pig iron in one day and night to make 100,000 double-wheeled double-furrow plows. These large-scale enterprises are the backbone for driving the national industrial development.

　　The colorful models of indigenous blast furnaces and indigenous converters that were on display were advanced furnaces selected from various places. The indigenous blast furnace created by the handicraft workers of Yingchao Iron Industry Cooperative in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, which has become famous throughout the country, does not use a single steel plate or refractory brick for masonry, but is replaced by blue bricks, ceramic bricks, and gravel; it does not use a single catty of coke for iron smelting, but is replaced by anthracite; and it does not use hot air but uses cold air. It only costs 400 yuan to build such a furnace, which produces 1.5 tons of gray iron per day and the quality is very good. The indigenous blast furnace created by the Huxishan Iron Plant in Lianyuan County, Hunan Province, has a short and fat furnace body and a very strong spleen and stomach. It can swallow the worst quality coal and lean ore with very little iron content and spit out molten iron. The workers affectionately call it the "omnipotent small blast furnace."

　　The workers of the Guxian Iron Plant in Shanxi Province created a hand-cranked small converter. Two small converters are equipped with a set of blowers, which can refine 1,000 tons of steel per year. The investment is only 1,000 yuan, and it only takes a few days from design to steel production. The local people used a song to praise this small converter: The light of the general line is like the sun, shining brightly on our hearts, boldly creating a red banner furnace, and molten steel is rolling all over Taihang.

　　Various places have also created indigenous methods of mining, ore dressing, sintering ore, indigenous methods of refining aluminum oxygen, refining copper, refining lead, refining zinc, refining mercury...

　　All these metallurgical enterprises, which are called small and indigenous, have common advantages that large-scale metallurgical enterprises do not have: low investment, fast construction, wide distribution, immediate results from investment, easy integration of production, supply, and sales, and conducive to reducing the gap between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants.

(III)

　　A large number of vivid examples at the exhibition show that in the magnificent mass movement of the whole people fighting for steel, thousands of steel red flags are waving, and these red flags are leading our country's metallurgical industry from victory to new victory. Since the beginning of this year, from production and design to capital construction, from mining, ore dressing, and smelting to rolling and processing, metallurgical workers across the country have created many unprecedented high-yield miracles.

　　The No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company is a leading red flag among the national iron smelting furnaces that have jumped into the world's advanced ranks. In the first half of the year, the iron-smelting workers improved the national blast furnace utilization coefficient from 0.757 last year to 0.626. In August, the two medium-sized blast furnaces in Benxi No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant had reached 0.517; while the blast furnace utilization coefficient in the United States last year was 1, which means that with blast furnaces of the same volume, our country can produce six-tenths more pig iron than the United States.

　　The utilization coefficient of steel-making open-hearth furnaces is calculated by the steel output per square meter of furnace bottom per day and night. The red flag of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant is raised the highest, reaching 14.227 tons in August; the national open-hearth furnace also increased from 7.21 tons last year to 7.7 tons in the first half of the year. And the United States only had 5.6 tons last year.

　　Old worker and Communist Party member Pan Ayao, who has been working for more than 30 years, is a flag among technical innovators. Pan Ayao is a worker at Shanghai Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory. This "alley small factory" with only dozens of workers and simple equipment is now the sister factory of Angang Seamless Steel Tube Factory. Encouraged by the Party's call to "catch up with Britain in fifteen years," the factory decided to manufacture seamless steel tubes with existing equipment. Communist Party member Pan Ayao and his partners worked day and night, painstakingly studying and overcoming many failures, and finally overcame a series of technical difficulties such as steel pipes being not straight, not smooth, cracked, and one end being too large and the other too small, creating amazing miracles: the quality of seamless steel tubes exceeded the quality of seamless steel tubes produced by the Renault factory in the United Kingdom in 1957, and the output can reach twice the output in the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan. Now, Pan Ayao's photo hangs in the hall of the Metallurgy Pavilion, and people look at his simple face and the straight, smooth, delicate, and uniform seamless steel tubes created by his intelligent hands with respectful eyes.

(IV)

　　This year, the metallurgical industry faces a new and grand task: to fully utilize our country's rich rare metal and rare earth metal resources, establish our own alloy steel system, and make our country's metallurgical technology reach the world's peak. People saw in the Metallurgy Pavilion that in just the first few months of this year, our country has produced 76 new alloy steel grades with good quality and low cost. For example, low-alloy high-strength steel—"Steel Commander 80"—its quality has exceeded that of similar products in the United States. It takes 20,000 tons of ordinary steel to build a Yangtze River bridge, but with this steel, 8,000 tons is enough. This new steel grade does not use nickel in terms of chemical composition, but uses several inexpensive elements that are abundant in our country. It is a major achievement in establishing its own alloy steel system according to our country's resource conditions. People proudly named it "Steel Commander 80" to show that it is the result of implementing political command and ideological liberation in the rectification movement, and to show that its strength and performance can command steel.

　　The exhibition quoted Vice Premier Chen Yi's poem: "Six hundred million people are unparalleled in the world, and it is already romantic to defeat strong enemies. Now, aiming at the natural world, we can freely travel on earth and in the sky." as an aspiration for the bright future of the metallurgical industry. After visiting the Metallurgy Pavilion, people confidently imagine that the days when our country's metallurgical industry reaches the peak of science and freely roams the sky are not only not a distant thing, but are also close at hand.

    帅旗飘飘
    本报记者　冯健
    毛主席说：“一个粮食，一个钢铁，
    有了这两个东西就什么都有了。”
    （一）
    跨进冶金馆，我们心里顿时涌溢着强烈的、战斗的激情：迎面是一幅半浮雕，钢包正在倾注钢水，它沸腾着，迸发出桔红色的光焰；在身材魁伟、神采奕奕的冶金工人塑像身后，巍然耸立着巨型钢锭和银色的巨型铝锭的模型；一支急剧高飞的朱红色的箭头，表明了千千万万冶金工人的决心：一定要在今年把钢产量从五百三十五万吨提高到一千零七十万吨，生铁产量也相应地提高，铜产量比去年增长135％，铝增长73％……。
    我们伫立在一块巨幅图板前面，凝视良久。它告诉我们，钢铁是我国社会主义建设的一面帅旗。有了钢铁，就有冶炼设备、机床，有电子计算机、原子反应堆、雷达等尖端工业，有电站、火车、汽车、飞机、轮船等先行工业，有钻塔、拖拉机、纺织机……。
    今天，我们的这面帅旗已经高高举起。我国已经生产出四百多种钢和四千多种钢材，各部门需要的合金钢和钢材，绝大部分能够自给了。那四十三吨重的大钢锭和六公尺高、一公尺半宽的大铝锭的诞生，鲜明地标志着我国工业已经达到更高的水平。
    今天，我们的这面帅旗已经插遍全国。看！今年全国冶金工业分布图上那些星罗棋布的布点，是令人兴奋鼓舞的我国冶金工业的一盘好棋。到今年年底，全国将建成和继续进行建设的大、中、小型冶金工厂、矿山共有四百五十五个，包括二百一十五个钢铁厂矿，二百四十个有色金属厂矿。在这四百多个冶金厂矿中，有四十二个是大型的，是发展冶金工业的骨干。而遍布全国各地千千万万个土高炉、小转炉，还未包括在内。可以看出，冶金工业今年的这盘棋已经布定，而且胜利在握了。
    看到这些动人心弦的展品，人们不禁会想起过去，为我国冶金工业的巨大成就而自豪。旧中国从1890年张之洞创办汉阳钢铁厂开始，到解放前的近六十年里，只不过生产了七百六十万吨钢；我们在残破的基础上兴家立业，八年生产了一千九百六十一万吨钢。第一个五年计划期间，我国钢、铜、铝的发展速度，都远远超过了所有资本主义国家。例如钢，我国每年平均猛增31.7％，而美国只有3.7％，英国3.9％。
    （二）
    展览会生动地告诉人们：我国的冶金工业建设，今年来了一个大革命。过去，只有少数人办，今天已经成为一个举国上下一齐动手、波澜壮阔的全民运动。党的社会主义建设的总路线，像灯塔一样照亮了人们的思想，冶金的秘密被揭破了。请看这里的几张照片：山东生产锅驼机的机械工人，河北山区的农民，守卫在福建前线的人民解放军官兵，北京的青年学生，辽宁省的商业营业员，这些从未炼过钢铁的、昨天的机械工人、农民、战士、学生、商人，今天都站在金光灿烂的炼铁、炼钢、炼铜炉前操作，成了冶金工人。
    这就是为什么在短短几个月里，冶金工业之花已经开遍全国的主要原因。像西南地区，四川、云南、贵州的人民，提出了向高山峻岭要铜要钢的豪迈誓言，有几十万劳动大军奔赴冶金前线。三个省互助协作，互相支援，今年生铁、钢、铜的产量，都将比去年增加数倍。
    我们在展览会上看到，大型的和中、小型的，“洋”的和“土”的冶金企业，在日日夜夜战斗着的钢铁战线上，并放异彩，各显威武。
    正在加速建设的武汉钢铁联合企业的模型，作为大型企业的代表在会上展出。不久前，我曾经访问过这个日夜沸腾着的建设工地。它是用世界上第一流的设备和技术装备起来的；建成后可以生产大量的、各种各样的大型钢材、钢管和钢板；已经提前出铁的一号高炉，一个昼夜生产的生铁，就足够制成十万部双轮双铧犁。这类大型企业，是带动全国工业发展的骨干。
    陈列出来的、多彩多姿的土高炉、土转炉模型，是从各地挑选出来的先进炉。已经闻名全国的、山西阳城县应朝铁业社手工业工人们创造的土高炉，砌炉不用一块钢板和耐火砖，而由青砖和陶瓷砖、砂石代替；炼铁不用一斤焦炭，而由无烟煤代替；不用热风而用冷风。只需四百元就能建成一座这样的炉子，日产灰口铁一吨半，质量很好。湖南涟源县虎溪山铁厂创造的土高炉，炉身矮胖矮胖的，脾胃十分强健，能吞进最劣质的煤和含铁量很少的贫矿石，吐出铁水，工人们都亲昵地称它“万能小高炉”。
    山西故县铁厂的工人们，创造了一种手摇小转炉。两个小转炉配一套鼓风机，每年能炼一千吨钢，投资不过一千元，从设计到出钢，只要几天工夫。当地群众用一首歌来赞美这种小转炉：总路线光芒像太阳，照得俺心坎亮堂堂，大胆创造红旗炉，钢水滚滚遍太行。
    各地还创造了土法采矿、选矿、烧结矿，土法炼铝氧、炼铜、炼铅、炼锌、炼汞……。
    所有这些被人们称为小的、土的冶金企业，都具有共同的、大型冶金企业所不及的长处：投资少，建设快，分布广，投资收效立竿见影，产供销易于结合，而且有利于缩小城乡和工农之间的差别。
    （三）
    展览会上大量生动的事例说明，在全民为钢铁而战的波澜壮阔的群众运动中，招展着千百面钢铁红旗，这些红旗把我国的冶金工业，从胜利引向新的胜利。今年以来，从生产、设计到基本建设，从采矿、选矿、冶炼到轧制加工，全国冶金工人已经创造出许许多多史无前例的高额丰产奇迹。
    本溪钢铁公司第一炼铁厂是全国炼铁炉跃居世界先进行列中一面领先的红旗。上半年，炼铁工人把全国高炉利用系数从去年的0.757改善到0.626，8月份本溪第一炼铁厂的两座中型高炉已经达到0.517；而美国去年的高炉利用系数是1，这就是说，用同样容积的高炉，我国能比美国多生产生铁十分之六。
    炼钢平炉的利用系数，以每平方公尺炉底一昼夜的钢产量计算，上海第三钢铁厂的红旗举得最高，8月份已达到14.227吨；全国平炉上半年也从去年的7.21吨提高到7.7吨。而美国，去年只有5.6吨。
    有三十多年工龄的老工人、共产党员潘阿耀是技术革新者当中的一面旗帜。潘阿耀是上海永鑫无缝钢管厂的工人，这个只有几十个工人、设备简陋的“弄堂小厂”，今天是鞍钢无缝钢管厂的姊妹厂。在党提出“十五年赶上英国”的号召鼓舞下，这个工厂决心以现有设备制造无缝钢管。共产党员潘阿耀和他的伙伴们，夜以继日地辛苦钻研，经历了多次失败，终于战胜了钢管不直、不光、裂缝和一头孔大、一头孔小等一系列技术困难，创造了惊人的奇迹：无缝钢管的质量，超过了英国雷诺工厂1957年无缝钢管的质量，产量可以达到第二个五年计划最后一年的两倍。现在，潘阿耀的照片悬挂在冶金馆的大厅里，人们用尊敬的目光注视着他那张淳朴的脸和他智慧的双手所创造出来的笔直、平滑、细腻、匀称的无缝钢管。
    （四）
    今年，冶金工业面前摆着一个新的宏伟的任务：充分利用我国丰富的稀有金属和稀土金属资源，建立我国自己的合金钢系统，使我国的冶金技术登上世界高峰。人们在冶金馆里看到，仅仅在今年头几个月，我国已经制成了七十六种质量好、成本低的新合金钢种。例如低合金高强度钢——“钢帅80”，质量已经超过了美国的同类产品。修建一座长江大桥需要普通钢两万吨，而用这种钢，八千吨就够了。这种新钢种，在化学成分方面不用镍，而采用了我国富产的几种廉价的元素，是根据我国资源条件建立自己合金钢系统的一项重大成就。人们自豪地用“钢帅80”来命名，是为了表示它是整风运动中实现政治挂帅、思想解放的成果，表示它的强度和性能都能在钢中挂帅。
    展览会引用陈毅副总理的诗句：“六亿人民世无俦，打败强敌已风流。而今对准自然界，入地上天逍遥游。”作为对冶金工业美好前景的憧憬。看过冶金馆以后，人们满怀信心地设想：我国冶金工业登上科学高峰，上天逍遥遨游的日子，不仅不是遥远的事情，而且近在眼前了。
