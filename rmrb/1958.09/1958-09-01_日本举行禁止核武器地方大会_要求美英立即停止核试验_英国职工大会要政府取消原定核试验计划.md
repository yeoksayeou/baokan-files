Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th – TASS reports from Tokyo on the 29th: A local Japanese conference banning nuclear weapons was held in Osaka City on the 28th.

More than 15,000 people participated in the conference, including representatives from labor unions, youth and women's organizations, activists striving for peace and opposing atomic war, World Federation of Trade Unions Secretary Grassi, World Federation of Democratic Youth Secretary Kinetsky, and many other foreign representatives.

The conference immediately transformed into a mass rally. A resolution was passed at the meeting demanding that the United States and Britain immediately cease nuclear testing.

At the mass rally, participants expressed their determination to fully support the resolutions of the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament. Participants also endorsed the resolutions proposed by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs aimed at preventing nuclear weapons from being brought into Japan and stopping the arming of Japan with nuclear weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 29th – The National Council of the British Trades Union Congress today called on the government to immediately cancel the nuclear weapons tests scheduled to be conducted at Christmas Island between now and October 31 (the date the British government suggested for negotiations on a ban on nuclear tests).

They also demanded that the government prepare for negotiations to halt nuclear testing and that the moratorium on testing be extended for more than a year, regardless of progress on international disarmament issues.

Xinhua News Agency, 31st – TASS reports from Buenos Aires on the 30th: Many Argentinian social groups and trade union organizations, political figures, and cultural celebrities advocate for the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing and the banning of nuclear weapons. A proposal containing this demand has already been submitted to the Chamber of Deputies of the National Congress for discussion.

According to "The Times", the demand to halt testing and ban nuclear weapons has become a national demand in Argentina. The newspaper condemns the United States for merely issuing statements on this matter while actually continuing to conduct thermonuclear weapon explosions.

    他们还要求政府准备举行谈判来停止核试验，并且要求把停止试验期限延长到一年以上，而不论在国际裁军问题上进展如何。
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯30日讯：阿根廷很多社会团体和工会组织、政界人士和文化名流都主张立即停止试验核武器并且禁止核武器。已经有一项包含这种要求的提案提交国民大会众议院要求进行讨论。
