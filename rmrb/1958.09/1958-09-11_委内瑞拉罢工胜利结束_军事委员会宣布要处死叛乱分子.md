Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, 10th: A general strike of one million workers throughout Venezuela demanding severe punishment for the plotters of the reactionary armed coup d'état ended victoriously on the 9th.

　　The massive general strike was launched on the 8th at the call of the Venezuelan National Labor Federation. The strike committee demanded that the Venezuelan Military Committee severely punish all those who participated in the military coup d'état launched on the 7th by lackeys of the U.S. running dog Jiménez, and take necessary measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The Venezuelan working class enthusiastically participated in this action to defend national independence. All shops, offices, and factories in the Caracas area closed their doors that day. In Maracaibo, the large oil center in western Venezuela, and other areas, the general strike was also thoroughly enforced. All activities in all sectors of Venezuela were temporarily suspended. At the same time, many well-known social activists and politicians in Venezuela criticized the Military Committee for not severely punishing those who launched the coup in the past.
　　
    The Venezuelan Military Committee announced that seven leaders of the coup d'état had been arrested, and four had fled to the embassies of Mexico and Cuba. The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry stated that it had requested the embassies of these two countries to extradite these conspirators. The Military Committee also claimed that the rebels would be executed.
　　
    In view of the Military Committee's announcement that the conspirators had been arrested, the National Labor Federation decided to end the general strike.

    委内瑞拉罢工胜利结束
    军事委员会宣布要处死叛乱分子
    新华社10日讯　加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉各地一百万工人要求严惩进行反动武装政变的阴谋分子的总罢工9日在取得很大胜利的情况下宣告停止。
    这个声势浩大的总罢工是在委内瑞拉全国劳工联合会号召下在8日举行的。罢工委员会要求委内瑞拉军事委员会严惩所有参加7日由美国走狗希门尼斯的爪牙发动的军事政变的人，并且采取必要措施防止今后发生类似事件。委内瑞拉工人阶级热烈参加了这个保卫民族独立的行动。加拉加斯地区所有店铺、办公室和工厂都在这一天关上门。在委内瑞拉西部大石油中心马拉开波和其他地区，总罢工也彻底执行了。委内瑞拉各行各业的活动都暂时停顿。同时，委内瑞拉国内许多有名的社会活动家和政治家也批评军事委员会过去没有严惩发动政变的人。
    委内瑞拉军事委员会宣布，有七名发动政变的领导人已经被逮捕，四名躲藏到墨西哥和古巴的大使馆中去了。委内瑞拉外交部声明，它已要求这两个国家的大使馆引渡这些阴谋分子。军事委员会并声称要处死叛乱分子。
    鉴于军事委员会宣布阴谋者被逮捕，全国劳工联合会决定停止总罢工。
