    Nationwide Copper Smelting
    In the great leap forward of the national economy, a new weak link has emerged - insufficient copper production.
    Copper is an important raw material for the electrical and mechanical industries. In order to meet the needs of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the electrical industry has been elevated to "pioneer," and the mechanical industry has taken the "marshal" position. However, the development of the electrical and mechanical industries requires not only a large amount of steel, but also a large amount of copper and aluminum. Manufacturing 10,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment typically requires 500 to 600 tons of copper and aluminum; including transformers and transmission lines, the total requirement is 800 tons of copper and aluminum. Manufacturing one tractor requires 31 kilograms of copper, and manufacturing one Liberation brand truck requires 21 kilograms of copper. Without copper and aluminum, steel is still just steel and cannot be turned into power generation equipment, trucks, tractors, and other mechanical industrial products to use new technology and equipment to transform all sectors of the national economy. Therefore, in industrialized countries around the world, copper and aluminum production maintains a certain ratio with steel production. Typically, for every 10 million tons of steel produced, 250,000 to 300,000 tons of copper and aluminum are produced. Now, the upsurge of nationwide steelmaking has been set off, with molten iron flowing and steel flowers splashing, but copper and aluminum production has not yet received sufficient attention. If we do not immediately grasp the development of the copper and aluminum industries, strive to increase copper and aluminum production several times within one year, and quickly change the backwardness of copper and aluminum production, it will inevitably affect the development of the electrical and mechanical industries, thereby affecting the pace of the entire national economy's leap forward. Under these circumstances, the entire Party and the entire people must, while continuing to grasp steel and machinery, grasp copper and aluminum in the same way as grasping steel and machinery, and treat the development of the copper and aluminum industries as a combat mission to be completed with a shock attack.
    We will discuss the issue of aluminum later; here, let's first talk about copper. Increasing copper production several times within a year is indeed a bold plan; if realized, it would be an unprecedented miracle. Can we create this miracle? Yes and no, depending on the policies we adopt.
    One policy is to only engage in modern, large-scale copper smelting enterprises. Are modern, large-scale copper smelting enterprises good? Of course, they are. We are also building some modern, large-scale copper smelting enterprises and must ensure that these modern, large-scale copper smelting enterprises are put into production as early as possible. This is an indispensable main force in China's development of the copper smelting industry. However, the construction of modern, large-scale copper smelting enterprises requires relatively concentrated resources that have been thoroughly explored, as well as a large amount of modern smelting equipment. However, China's copper resources are relatively dispersed, and most have not been thoroughly explored, and the manufacturing capacity of smelting equipment is also limited. If we only engage in modern, large-scale copper smelting enterprises, it is clear that it will not be possible to develop the copper smelting industry at a high speed, nor will it be possible to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.
    However, if we start from a different perspective, not just focusing on modern, large-scale copper smelting enterprises, but adhering to the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small enterprises, then we can come to the opposite conclusion: increasing copper production several times within a year is definitely achievable. Dispersed resources are indeed a disadvantage for building modern, large-scale copper smelting enterprises; but if we build small, indigenous or a combination of both types of copper smelting enterprises, they become an advantage. Are dispersed resources, with many points and a wide area, perfect for organizing the masses to mine locally and flourish everywhere? Isn't this a very advantageous condition? Unclear long-term reserves are indeed a disadvantage for building modern, large-scale copper smelting enterprises; but if we build small, indigenous or a combination of both types of copper smelting enterprises, they are not much of a problem. Small, indigenous or a combination of both types of copper smelting enterprises can mine when ore is found, extracting as much as possible. Manufacturing smelting equipment for modern, large-scale copper smelting enterprises is indeed time-consuming, but if we build small, indigenous or a combination of both types of copper smelting enterprises, equipment manufacturing can be done using local materials and making do with whatever is available. What difficulty is there? Therefore, as long as our thinking is correct and our path is right, not just keeping our eyes on foreign methods and large enterprises, but combining indigenous and foreign methods, with most areas relying on indigenous methods, and combining large, medium, and small enterprises, with small and medium enterprises being the main focus, we can fully develop the copper smelting industry at a high speed.
    Of course, this does not mean that increasing copper production several times within a year is an easy task. There are many difficulties facing us, and there are many things to do. The most important thing at present is to launch a nationwide copper smelting upsurge, organizing millions of people across the country to go up the mountains to mine and smelt copper. Indigenous copper smelting does not have any major technical problems. China is a country with a long history of copper smelting, and there are many folk copper smelting experts. The problem is that indigenous copper smelting requires a large amount of labor. If we produce hundreds of thousands of tons of copper, it is estimated that each province will have to organize tens of thousands, or even more, of laborers to go up the mountains. This is a huge mobilization and organization effort. According to statistics, more than 3,000 copper mineral resources have been discovered nationwide. In addition to continuing to organize exploration, these more than 3,000 copper mines are the battlefields for millions of laborers. Party committees at all levels should be responsible at each level, arranging labor to ensure that no exploitable copper mine is missed, and ensuring that there are people wherever there is copper. Now, Yunnan Province has elevated copper to "deputy marshal" and organized a movement to mobilize 100,000 farmers to go up the mountains to smelt copper. This is a good example. Of course, because agricultural production is extremely tight and the task of steel production is also very heavy, organizing farmers to go up the mountains to smelt copper can only be done on a large scale during the slack season and on a small scale during the busy season. This requires that, in addition to mobilizing the local masses, counties, districts, and townships without copper mines should also be mobilized to organize expeditionary forces to support areas with copper mines that lack labor.
    To develop the copper smelting industry at a high speed, in addition to organizing labor to go up the mountains, we must also organize all aspects of forces to cooperate. Copper smelting requires fuel. In ancient China, copper smelting mostly used charcoal as fuel. To this day, around the ruins of ancient copper mines, there are often dozens of miles of barren mountains and bald forests. The demise of these ancient copper mines was often not due to the depletion of mineral resources, but because the wood was exhausted. It can be seen how important ensuring fuel supply is to the development of the copper smelting industry. Wood is a valuable national resource, and now copper smelting should use coal. However, copper and coal are formed in two different geological conditions, and places with copper often do not have coal. This requires overall planning in various places, and requires coal miners to produce more coal to ensure the needs of the copper smelting industry. Places with copper mines are mostly remote mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation and difficult transport. To transport coal in, to transport copper out, and to ensure that millions of people have food and supplies after going up the mountains, we must open mountains and build roads, and vigorously organize material supplies. This is an important task for transportation departments, commercial departments, and the local people. In addition, the mechanical industry, especially local mechanical industry departments, needs to cooperate to solve equipment manufacturing. Commercial departments should also continue to actively purchase scrap copper. Various regions should widely exchange experiences in mining, ore dressing, furnace construction, and smelting to accelerate construction, increase recovery rates, increase labor efficiency, increase production, and reduce costs.
    It should also be pointed out that after indigenous methods are launched, all localities should pay attention to developing towards small-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization in a planned way. Our current policy is to combine indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods being the main focus. This is unwavering. However, we should see the shortcomings of indigenous copper smelting, such as high labor consumption, low resource recovery rates, and high costs. Therefore, after indigenous methods are launched, we should actively study small-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization, especially ensuring that we select copper mines with better resource conditions from among the more than 3,000 copper mining points and rapidly develop towards small-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization.
    Our historical experience of revolution and the experience of socialist construction have proven that as long as the entire Party is mobilized and the entire people are mobilized, there are no insurmountable difficulties in front of us. Developing the copper smelting industry at a high speed is a major combat mission in socialist industrialization. Let us take action immediately and launch a nationwide copper smelting upsurge!

    全民炼铜
    在国民经济的大跃进中，出现了一个新的薄弱环节——铜的生产不足。
   铜是电力工业和机械工业的重要原料。为了满足工农业大跃进的需要，电力工业被举为“先行”，机械工业已居“元帅”帐位。但电力工业和机械工业的发展，不仅需要大量的钢铁，还需要大量的铜和铝。制造一万瓩的发电设备，通常需要五百吨至六百吨铜和铝，如果把变电设备、输电线路计算在内共需要八百吨铜和铝。制造一台拖拉机需要三十一公斤铜，制造一辆解放牌汽车也需要二十一公斤铜。只有钢铁，没有铜铝，钢铁还是钢铁，并不能变成发电设备和汽车、拖拉机等机械工业产品，从而用新的技术装备去改造国民经济的各个部门。因此，世界上工业发达的国家，铜和铝的生产都同钢的生产保持一定的比例，通常每生产一千万吨钢，就要生产二十五万吨至三十万吨铜和铝。现在，全民办钢铁的热潮已经掀起来了，铁水奔流，钢花四溅，而铜和铝的生产还没有普遍得到足够的重视。如果不马上抓铜、铝工业的发展，争取在一年的时间内使铜铝的生产增加几倍，迅速改变铜铝生产水平的落后情况，势必要影响电力工业和机械工业的发展，从而影响整个国民经济的跃进速度。在这种情况下，全党全民在继续抓钢铁、抓机械的同时，必须像抓钢铁、抓机械一样地来抓铜铝，把发展铜铝工业当做一个战斗任务，突击完成。
    关于铝的问题，我们以后再谈；这里先谈铜。在一年的时间内使铜的生产增加几倍，确实是一个大胆的计划；如果实现了的话，将是亘古未有的奇迹。我们能不能创造这个奇迹呢？也能也不能，全看我们采取什么方针。
    一种方针是只搞现代化的大型炼铜企业。现代化的大型炼铜企业好不好呢！当然很好。我们也正在建设一些现代化的大型炼铜企业，并且一定要保证这些现代化的大型炼铜企业及早投入生产。这是我国发展炼铜工业一支不可忽视的主力军。然而，建设现代化的大型炼铜企业，需要经过详细勘探的比较集中的资源，需要大量现代化的冶炼设备；而我国的铜矿资源却比较分散，并且大都没有经过详细勘探，冶炼设备的制造能力也很有限。如果只搞现代化的大型炼铜企业，显然就不可能高速度地发展炼铜工业，不可能多快好省。
    然而，如果换一个角度出发，不是只看到现代化的大型炼铜企业，而是坚持土洋结合，大中小结合的方针，那就完全可以得出相反的结论：一年之内使铜的产量增加几倍一定能够做到。资源分散，对于建设现代化的大型炼铜企业，确实是个不利的条件；但如果是建设土法的、土洋结合的小型炼铜企业，又变成有利的条件。资源分散，点多面广，正好组织群众就地开采，遍地开花，这不是十分有利的条件吗？远景储量不明，对于建设现代化的大型炼铜企业，也确实是个不利的条件；但如果是建设土法的、土洋结合的小型炼铜企业，却又算不了是什么困难。土法的、土洋结合的小型炼铜企业本来就可以是见矿就采，有多少采多少的。制造现代化大型炼铜企业的冶炼设备确实费时，但如果是建设土法的、土洋结合的小型炼铜企业，设备制造可以就地取材，因陋就简，又有何难哉？可见，只要思想对头，路子走对，不是眼睛只盯着洋办法、大企业；而是土洋结合，大部分的地方还应该以土为主，大中小并举，以中小为主，我们就完全可以高速度地发展炼铜工业。
    当然，这并不是说一年之中使铜的产量增加几倍就是件轻而易举的事情。摆在我们面前的困难很多，要作的事情也很多。当前最关紧要的，就是掀起一个全民炼铜的高潮，在全国范围内组织几百万人上山开矿炼铜。土法炼铜，技术上没有什么大问题，我国是一个有着悠久的炼铜历史的国家，民间的炼铜专家不在少数。问题在于土法炼铜需要大量的劳动力。如果生产几十万吨铜，估计各省都要组织数万，甚至更多的劳动大军上山。这是一个巨大的动员工作和组织工作。据统计，全国已经发现的铜矿资源达三千多处，除了继续组织勘探之外，目前这三千多处铜矿就是数百万劳动大军的战场。各级党委应该层层负责，安排劳动力，争取保证不漏掉一处可以开采的铜矿，做到有铜就有人。现在云南省已经举铜为“副帅”，组织了一个发动十万农民上山炼铜的运动。这是一个好榜样。当然，由于农业生产极其紧张，钢铁生产的任务也很繁重，组织农民上山炼铜只能农闲大搞，农忙小搞，这就需要除了发动当地群众之外，还要发动没有铜矿的县、区、乡组织远征军，支援有铜矿而缺乏劳动力的地区。
    高速度地发展炼铜工业，除了组织劳动力上山之外，还要组织各方面的力量协作配合。炼铜需要燃料。我国古代炼铜大都用木炭作燃料，至今在古代铜矿的遗址周围，常常几十里地尽是荒山秃林。这些古代铜矿的夭折，很多都不是因为矿藏枯竭，而是由于木材用尽。可见保证燃料供应，对于炼铜工业的发展是一个多么重要的因素。木材是国家宝贵的资源，现在炼铜应该用煤炭。但铜和煤炭却生成在两种不同的地质条件中，有铜的地方常常没有煤。这就需要各个地方统筹安排，需要煤矿工人生产更多的煤炭，保证炼铜工业的需要。有铜矿的地方大都是偏僻的山区，交通不便，运输困难。要把煤炭运进去，要把铜运出来，要保证几百万人上山以后有吃有用，必须开山筑路，大力组织物资供应。这是运输部门、商业部门和当地人民群众的重要任务。此外，设备制造方面还需要机械工业、特别是地方机械工业部门协作解决。商业部门也应该继续积极地收购废铜。各个地区之间应该广泛地交流采矿、选矿、建炉和冶炼的经验，加快建设速度，提高回收率，提高劳动效率，提高产量，降低成本。
    还需要指出，土法上马之后，各地都应该注意有计划地向小型机械化、半机械化发展。我们目前的方针是土洋结合，以土为主。这是坚定不移的。但是，我们应该看到土法炼铜的缺点，如劳动力消耗大，资源回收率低、成本高等等。因此，在土法上马之后，就应该积极研究小型机械化、半机械化，特别是要保证在三千多个铜矿点中，选择资源条件较好的，迅速向小型机械化、半机械化发展。
    我们革命的历史经验和社会主义建设的经验，都证明了只要全党动员、全民动员，在我们的面前就没有不可战胜的困难。高速度地发展炼铜工业，是社会主义工业化中关系重大的战斗任务，让我们立即行动起来，掀起全民炼铜的高潮！
