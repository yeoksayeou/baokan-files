　　An Inspiring Declaration
　　Xu Guangping
　　Premier Zhou's declaration is inspiring. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and Taiwan and its coastal islands must be liberated! The people of Taiwan and other places will certainly return to the embrace of the motherland; the six hundred million Chinese people who have already stood up will never allow the ambitions of American imperialism to succeed. We definitely have the strength to shatter its plots and schemes! In the face of peace-loving people all over the world, the American imperialists cannot be tolerated in occupying Taiwan. The tolerance of the Chinese people also has its limits. Eisenhower's playing with fire threatens the peace of all mankind. To strike the aggressors is the sacred responsibility of us who defend peace and protect the motherland.

　　振奋人心的声明
    许广平
    周总理的声明激奋人心。台湾是中国的领土，台湾及沿海岛屿一定要解放！台湾等地的人民一定会回到祖国的怀抱；已经站起来了的六亿中国人民决不容许美帝国主义的野心得逞。我们一定有力量粉碎它的阴谋鬼计！在全世界爱好和平的人民面前不能容忍美帝霸占台湾。中国人民的容忍亦有一定的限度，艾森豪威尔的玩火态度威胁全人类的和平。予侵略者以打击，是我们捍卫和平、保卫祖国者的神圣责任。
