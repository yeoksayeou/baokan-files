Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong Electric Dispatch: Hong Kong Chung Wah Middle School held its opening ceremony for the first semester of 1958 on the 6th and officially began classes. Teachers, students, and guests from all walks of life unanimously expressed at the opening ceremony that they would continue to oppose the Hong Kong British authorities' persecution of the Chinese people's education and insist on strengthening the school's patriotic education.

The opening ceremony was held on the school's sports field, and more than 300 guests from all walks of life attended to offer congratulations. Principal Huang Zufeng first spoke, saying that Chung Wah Middle School was able to open as scheduled because it had received strong support and moral support from people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and the compatriots in the motherland. He said that since the Hong Kong British authorities forcibly closed the Chung Wah Middle School with force, more than 20,000 representatives of residents from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon have visited the school to express their condolences and support in the past ten days, sending more than 20,000 yuan in condolences, and more than 500 letters and telegrams of condolences from the capital and all over the country. Workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon used eight hours of voluntary labor to build the current temporary classrooms for the school. These facts make us deeply believe that the patriotic cause of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon is inviolable, and our cause will surely be victorious. He also said that the Hong Kong British authorities have not yet approved the repair of the Chung Wah Middle School, and this dilatory attitude towards solving the problem must be changed quickly. Huang Zufeng finally assured the guests and parents present that Chung Wah Middle School will definitely adhere to patriotic education, run the school better, and will not disappoint the expectations of the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and the compatriots in the motherland.

Zhao Kezhi, a representative of the education sector in Hong Kong and Kowloon, said at the meeting that the Hong Kong British authorities are still delaying the approval of the school building's repairs. Therefore, we must continue to strongly support the struggle of Chung Wah Middle School until the school building's repair issue is completely resolved.

Zhong Baisheng, a student representative of Chung Wah Middle School, made a guarantee at the meeting, saying that the students of Chung Wah Middle School must resolutely accept patriotic education.

Huang Yanqing, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Chung Wah Middle School, Chen Jiansheng, a representative of parents, and others also expressed their respect to all teachers and students at the opening ceremony.

People from all walks of life in Hong Kong warmly support Chung Wah Middle School, and many people send their children to this school. In the week since the Hong Kong British authorities forcibly closed the school building on August 26, more than 40 new students have enrolled.

    反对暴力摧残　坚持爱国教育事业
　　香港中华中学正式开学
    新华社香港电　香港中华中学6日举行1958年度上学期开学典礼，并且开始正式上课。学校师生和各界来宾在开学典礼上一致表示要继续反对香港英国当局迫害中国人民教育事业，坚持加强学校的爱国主义教育。
    开学典礼在学校的运动场上举行，各界来宾三百多人前往道贺。黄祖芬校长首先讲话说，中华中学能够如期开学是因为得到了香港各界人士和祖国同胞的大力支持和道义上的声援。他说，自从中华中学校舍被香港英国当局用武力强行封闭，十多天来前往学校慰问和表示支持的港九各界居民代表达两万多人，送来慰问金两万多元，来自首都和全国各地的慰问函电共五百多封。港九工人用八小时的义务劳动，为学校盖起了现在的临时课室。这些事实使我们深深地相信，港九中国人民的爱国事业是不容侵犯的，我们的事业是一定要胜利的。他又说，香港英国当局至今还没有批准中华中学修理校舍，这种拖延解决问题的态度必须迅速改变。黄祖芬最后向到会的来宾和家长保证：中华中学一定坚持爱国主义教育，把学校办得更好，决不辜负港九同胞和祖国同胞的祈望。
    港九教育界代表赵克墀在会上讲话说，香港英国当局现在还拖延批准校舍的修建，因此，我们一定继续大力支持中华中学的斗争，直到校舍修建问题得到完满解决为止。
    中华中学学生代表钟柏生在会上提出保证说，中华中学的学生一定要坚决接受爱国主义的教育。
    中华中学董事会董事长黄燕清，家长代表陈俭生等人也在开学典礼上向全体师生表达了敬意。
    香港各界人士热烈支持中华中学，许多人都把他们的子弟送入这所学校，仅从8月26日香港英国当局用武力封闭校舍以后的一周间，就有四十多个新生报名入学。
