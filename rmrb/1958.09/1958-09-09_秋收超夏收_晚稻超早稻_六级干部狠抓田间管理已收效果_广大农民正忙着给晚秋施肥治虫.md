Autumn Harvest Surpasses Summer Harvest, Late Rice Surpasses Early Rice
Six-Level Cadres Vigorously Grasp Field Management with Positive Results
Broad Masses of Peasants Are Busy Fertilizing and Treating Pests in Late Autumn Crops

(By our newspaper) According to reports from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions at a recent telephone conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture: autumn crops in various regions are generally growing well, and a bumper harvest is highly promising. In the south, single-season late rice has already entered the heading and flowering stage, while double-season late rice is in its peak tillering period, with robust seedling growth. Northern rice has also entered the heading stage; early autumn crops such as corn, millet, and sorghum are nearing completion of harvest, with yields greatly exceeding previous years; late autumn grain crops are growing even better and are in the grain-filling stage. Economic crops such as cotton and sugar料, as well as oil crops such as peanuts, sesame, and soybeans, are all growing better than in previous years, with a generally promising bumper harvest.

The good growth of autumn crops is the result of the vigorous field management implemented by various regions in accordance with the central government's instructions. After the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a notice on August 1 regarding strengthening field management of autumn grain, various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions universally made specific arrangements, organized six-level cadres to converge at the fields, and led peasants in vigorously engaging in field management. According to statistics from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Guizhou, Shanxi, Shandong, and Guangxi provinces and regions alone, more than 8.5 million cadres participated in the field management inspection. In Fujian Province, the number of cadres and masses participating in the inspection reached more than 5 million. Through inspection visits, comparisons, and big debates, cadres and peasants in various regions broke the "deterministic theory," changed the old habit of "hanging up the hoe after the Autumn Equinox," and put forward the fighting slogan of "management will not stop until the autumn harvest is complete." They set specific fighting goals to achieve "four-no's" and "six-no's," such as no weeds, no pests and diseases, and no third-class seedlings in the fields. A field management campaign with the main content of topdressing, cultivating, weeding, and pest and disease control was rapidly launched. During the campaign, many county, district, township, and commune cadres and peasants in many places set up large camps in the fields, "living with the seedlings and sharing the same heart with the crops," and field management was carried out quickly and well. As a result of such vigorous efforts, a new atmosphere of "three-mores" and "three-lesses" has universally appeared in various regions for autumn crops: more irrigation and topdressing, more cultivation and weeding, more spraying of pesticides, and fewer weak seedlings, fewer weeds, and less pest and disease damage. Before the campaign, third-class seedlings generally accounted for 20% to 30% of the total. After processing and management, they generally dropped to below 10%, with some as low as about 5%. In Henan Province, 97% of the 12 million mu of third-class seedlings were upgraded after processing. Shandong Province not only basically eliminated weeds, but also 70% of the townships achieved "six-no's." In Hebei Province, 80% of the communes achieved "four-no's." The oriental tobacco budworm in some cotton fields in the Yangtze River basin in Hubei, Anhui and other provinces, and the armyworm pests in some areas of Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong and other provinces have been basically eliminated.

While strengthening field management, in some areas suffering from flood and drought disasters, the broad masses of cadres and peasants also waged a tenacious struggle against these disasters. In Macheng County, Hubei Province, due to heavy rain and flash floods, more than 100,000 mu of cotton and more than 200,000 mu of rice were flooded. The peasants of the county organized labor, cooperated on a large scale with waterwheels, and carried out emergency drainage and seedling washing day and night. Some townships and communes achieved dry fields and clean seedlings within a day or two. Now the traces of the disaster have been basically eliminated throughout the county, and various crops are growing well. In Anhui Province, the drought was serious some time ago. In the struggle against drought, the broad masses of peasants not only built 150 million cubic meters of water conservancy projects to enhance drought resistance, but also adopted the method of "moving seedlings to water" to move tens of thousands of mu of severely drought-stricken rice seedlings to fields with water sources, ensuring the growth of the seedlings.

Currently, the battle to strengthen autumn field management is still continuing vigorously in various regions. The broad masses of cadres and peasants have shifted the focus of field management to late autumn crops, and are giving late autumn crops processing, fertilization, and pest and disease control. Southern peasants are processing late rice. Some areas of Jiangxi, Hubei, Hebei, Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia provinces and regions that still have drought are continuing to fight drought. The slogan of the broad masses of peasants throughout the country is: adhere to "management will not stop until the autumn harvest is complete," overcome various disasters that have occurred and may occur, and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of grain, cotton, oil and other crops in autumn.

### 秋收超夏收　晚稻超早稻  六级干部狠抓田间管理已收效果  广大农民正忙着给晚秋施肥治虫

　　秋收超夏收　晚稻超早稻
    六级干部狠抓田间管理已收效果
    广大农民正忙着给晚秋施肥治虫
    本报讯　据各省、市和自治区最近在农业部召开的电话会议上汇报：各地秋收作物普遍生长良好，丰收大有希望。南方单季晚稻已经孕穗抽穗，双季晚稻正是分蘖盛期，禾苗生长茁壮。北方水稻也已抽穗；早秋的玉米、谷子、高粱等作物即将收完，产量大大超过往年；晚秋粮食作物长得更好，正在灌浆。各地棉花、糖料等经济作物和花生、芝麻、大豆等油料作物都长得比往年好，普遍丰收在望。
    秋收作物生长良好是各地根据中央指示大抓田间管理的结果。8月1日中共中央发出关于抓好秋粮田间管理的通知后，各省、市和自治区普遍进行了具体部署，组织六级干部在田头会师，领导农民大搞田间管理。仅据江苏、浙江、安徽、湖北、贵州、山西、山东和广西等省、区统计，计有八百五十多万名干部参加了田间管理大检查。福建省参加检查的干部和群众达五百多万人。各地干部和农民，通过检查参观评比和大鸣大放大辩论，打破了“定局论”，改变了“立了秋挂锄钩”的旧习惯，提出“秋收不到家，管理不停止”的战斗口号，订出要实现田间无杂草、无病虫、无三类苗等“四无”、“六无”的具体战斗目标，迅速地掀起了以追肥、中耕除草和防治病虫害等为主要内容的田间管理运动。在运动中，很多地方县、区、乡、社干部和农民，在田间扎了大营，“与禾苗同住，与庄稼同心”，田间管理搞得又快又好。这样大干的结果，各地普遍出现了秋收作物灌溉追肥多、中耕除草多、喷撒药剂多等“三多”和弱苗少、杂草少、病虫危害少等“三少”的新气象。运动开展前，各地三类苗一般占20％到30％，经过加工管理普遍降到10％以下，少的在5％左右。河南省一千二百万亩三类苗经加工有97％升了级，山东省不仅基本上消灭了草荒，还有70％的乡达到“六无”，河北省有80％的社做到了“四无”。湖北安徽等省长江流域棉区部分棉田中发生的斜纹夜蛾和辽宁、河北、山东等省部分地区发生的沾虫等虫害，都已基本消灭。
    在加强田间管理的同时，部分遭受水旱灾害的地区，广大干部和农民还和这些灾害展开了顽强的斗争。湖北省麻城县由于雨大山洪暴发，全县有十万多亩棉花二十多万亩水稻被淹。全县农民组织劳力，水车大协作，日夜突击排水洗苗，部分乡社在一两天内就做到了水干苗净。现在全县已经基本消灭了灾害痕迹，各种作物都长得很好。安徽省前些时候旱象严重，广大农民在抗旱斗争中，不仅兴修了一亿五千万土方的水利工程，增强了抗旱能力，而且采取“移苗就水”的办法，把十几万亩受旱严重的稻苗移到有水源的田里，保证了稻苗的生长。
    当前，各地加强秋田管理的战斗仍在继续大力进行。广大干部和农民已把田间管理的重点转到晚秋作物，正给晚秋作物加工加肥和防治病虫害。南方农民正对晚稻加工。江西、湖北、河北、辽宁和内蒙古等省、区仍有旱象的部分地区正在继续抗旱。全国各地广大农民的口号是：坚持“秋收不到家，管理不收兵”，战胜已经发生和可能发生的各种灾害，力争秋季粮、棉、油料等各种作物全面大丰收。
