"Pioneer Official" Quickly Clears the Way for the "Marshal"
Mù Fānghuá

The order of the Party and the people of the whole country: The three marshals are to ascend to their posts and take command. The one leading the way is the Grain Marshal, who is almost already in the central command tent—the annual grain yield of 600 billion to 700 billion jin is already in sight. Next is the Steel Marshal, who has received the battle order to "Strive to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year!" Under the frequent urging of war drums, it is about to move forward in big strides. Following that is the Machinery Marshal...

The ascension of the three marshals is a top priority for the Chinese people. If the three marshals can sit firmly in the central command tent, victory can be said to be within our grasp. With people who possess heaven-storming, earth-shattering heroic spirit, with sufficient grain, with strong steel, and with powerful mechanical equipment, what a majestic sight it would be. At that time, we will create miracles even more magical than all the miracles we have now, and we will enter a scene of incredible beauty!

However, the marshals are urging the pioneer officials to clear the way quickly! In marching and fighting, to achieve quick success and instant victory, pioneers are indispensable. The pioneer official is so important: they must open roads through mountains, build bridges across rivers, and charge forward to establish extraordinary achievements. Therefore, the position of pioneer official has always been a glorious one, and those who can be entrusted with the pioneer seal have always been the best of the best. Therefore, in ancient times, when armies were reviewed on the drill ground, people always risked their lives to compete for the pioneer seal. Now, the two pioneer officials—electricity and railway transportation—have been selected. Now they must immediately show their great skills. Speaking only of the railway transportation pioneer official, it currently bears the most arduous, the heaviest, and also the most glorious task. Grain must be transported, ore must be transported, coal must be transported, steel must be transported, machinery must be transported, all means of production and means of livelihood need transportation, what a glorious task this is; but it faces a tough battle where there is more freight than available cars, and it must win and cannot afford to lose, what an arduous task this is. But the task must be completed: if it is completed well, one can establish meritorious service in the battle to build the socialist motherland; if it is not completed well, it will "delay military affairs" and become a stumbling block to the motherland's leap forward. The whole world and all of mankind are expecting our motherland's victory. They eagerly await its rapid development, glorious pioneer officials, you must not and will not miss the opportunity.

The pioneer official must have the precious quality of not retreating in the face of difficulties, they must be good at seizing opportunities, and be able to overcome all difficulties and move forward courageously. "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold," the pioneer official must "seize every second and compete for cars with time" to ensure the smooth advance of the entire army.

Railway workers have a glorious tradition in our revolutionary history, and they have served as pioneer officials in revolutionary struggles. In the glorious battle to build the great motherland, they will surely complete the glorious task of pioneer officials. Now, the workers of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau have already raised the red flag first and sent out a signal of victory. It tells us that the pioneer officials have already urged the army to clear the way for the marshals. However, generally speaking, it still needs to be faster, faster, and faster. All railway transport workers and all other transport workers should learn from the workers of Jintie and advance again and again! Glory! Pioneer officials!

    “先行官”快为“元帅开路”
    慕方华
    党和全国人民的命令：要三大元帅升帐视事。走在前边的是粮食大元帅，它差不多已经走进了中军帐——全年六千亿斤至七千亿斤粮食，已经是在望的了。接着是钢铁大元帅，它接受的战斗命令是“为在今年生产一千零七十万吨钢而奋斗！”在战鼓频催之下，它就要大踏步前进了。再接着是机械大元帅……。
    三大元帅升帐对我国人民来说，是一件头等的大事。如果三大元帅能够稳坐中军帐，胜利可以说已在我们把握之中。有着顶天立地的英雄气魄的人民，有了足够的粮食，有了雄厚的钢铁，再有了强大机械的装备，会是何等的威风。到那时我们将会创造比现在所有的奇迹更为神奇的奇迹，我们将会进入一个如何美妙的胜景啊！
    可是，元帅在催先行官快快开路！行兵打仗，要想旗开得胜、马到成功，是离不了先行的。先行官是这样的重要：它要逢山开路，遇水搭桥，冲锋陷阵立奇功。所以，先行官从来就是个光荣的职务，能挂先行印的，从来都是战将中的能手。所以古来校场点军，总是有人拼着性命去争夺先行印。现在两家先行官——电力和铁路运输，已经选定了。现在要它们立即来大显身手。单说铁路运输先行官，目前担负的任务最艰巨、最繁重也最光荣。粮食要运，矿石要运，煤炭要运，钢铁要运，机械要运，一切一切的生产资料生活资料，都需要运输，这任务是何等的光荣；但它面临的是一场货多车少，又一定要它只能胜不能败的硬仗，这任务又是何等的艰巨。但任务必须完成：完成的好，就可以在建设社会主义祖国的战斗中建树功勋；完成的不好，就要“贻误军机”，成为祖国飞跃前进的绊脚石。全世界全人类都在期待我们祖国的胜利。眼巴巴地盼望它飞跃发展，光荣的先行官啊，你决不能也不会坐失时机。
    先行官要有在困难面前毫不退缩的可贵品质，它要善于抓紧时机，能破万难而勇往直前。“一寸光阴一寸金”，先行官必须“分秒必争，向时间要车”，才能保证全军顺利前进。
    铁路职工在我们革命史上有着光荣的传统，他们曾经充任过革命斗争的先行官。在建设伟大祖国的光荣战斗中，他们必定能完成先行官的光荣重任。现在，锦州铁路局的职工们，已经首先树起了红旗，发出了胜利的信号。它告诉我们，先行官已经催动大军为元帅开路了。但是，就整个地说来还需要快些快些再快些。所有的铁路运输工人以及所有的其他运输工人，都应该向锦铁的职工们看齐，前进再前进！光荣啊！先行官们！
