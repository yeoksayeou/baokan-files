　　Twelve Heats of Iron in a Day
    Recently, our Youth Team's small blast furnace has continuously set high production records for two days. On August 24th, the daily output of pig iron from the small blast furnace reached 34.4 tons, and the next day it increased to 35.03 tons. All the comrades in our furnace are excited and proud of this contribution to accelerating the arrival of the Iron and Steel Marshal.
    Our team consists of twenty-nine young workers, whose ironmaking experience is very short. The longest is only half a year, and the shortest is less than a month. In order to increase production, we boldly changed the blast furnace from eight heats of iron a day to twelve heats. Everyone didn't have much experience in ironmaking, so we worked hard, strengthened cooperation between different types of work, and helped each other. As a result, we achieved the leap forward target three days ahead of schedule.
    All the workers in our team are not satisfied with the existing achievements and are determined to continue to work hard, make persistent efforts, and strive for greater achievements.

　　一天出铁十二次
    最近，我们青年号小高炉连续两天创造了高产纪录。8月24日，小高炉生铁日产量达到三十四点四吨，第二天又提高到三十五点零三吨。我们炉上的全体同志都为加速钢铁元帅升帐的这一贡献感到兴奋和自豪。
    我们全组共有二十九个青年工人，炼铁工龄都很短，最长的不过半年，最短的还不到一个月。为了提高产量，我们大胆地把高炉一天出八次铁改为出十二次。大家的炼铁经验不多，就艰苦钻研，加强工种与工种之间的协作，互相帮助。结果，我们提前三天，实现了跃进指标。
    我们全组工人并不满足已有的成绩，决心继续努力，再接再厉，争取更大的成绩。
