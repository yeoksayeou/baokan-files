　　China's First Cobalt Treatment Machine for Cancer Tumors
    The Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin Medical College has successfully trial-produced China's first cobalt (Co60) treatment machine for cancer tumors.

    Treating cancer tumors with cobalt is better than the currently commonly used deep X-ray therapy machine and radium treatment: The penetration ability of the cobalt treatment machine is more than six times greater than that of the deep X-ray therapy machine. It has a relatively high treatment rate for human cancers, especially lung tumors, esophageal cancer, cervical cancer, etc. Moreover, the skin reactions and systemic reactions it causes are relatively small, making it more suitable for treating patients with severe late-stage cancer tumors. All the technical personnel of the Engineering Section of the Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin Medical College, working hard for twenty-three days under conditions of lacking experience and perfect equipment, made this first domestically produced cobalt treatment machine on August 30.

　　我国第一台治癌瘤的钴治疗机
    天津医学院附属医院试制成功国产第一架治疗癌瘤的钴（Co60）治疗机。
    用钴治疗癌瘤，比现在通常采用的深部X线治疗机和用镭治疗的效果好：钴治疗机比深部X线治疗机的穿透能力大六倍以上，对人体癌瘤，特别是肺瘤、食管癌、子宫颈癌等的治疗率比较高，而且它所引起的皮肤反应和全身反应都比较小，因此更适于重症晚期癌瘤病人的治疗。天津医学院附属医院工程股全体技术人员在缺乏经验和完善设备条件下，苦战了二十三天，在8月30日制成这架国产第一架钴治疗机。
