　　Broad and beloved compatriots! Comrades!
    Today, people from all walks of life in the capital are gathering in Tiananmen Square to support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area and to resolutely oppose the military provocations of U.S. imperialism. On behalf of all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association, I assure the assembly: We are determined to take action and, together with the people of the whole country, fight to liberate our own territory and to completely smash the military provocations of the United States!
    Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, Jinmen, Mazu and other coastal islands are all Chinese territory. Liberating our own territory is the sacred and inviolable right of the Chinese people, and no country can interfere. The Chinese people cannot tolerate the existence of direct threats like Jinmen and Mazu in the inland sea of our mainland. The Chinese people love peace, but they are never afraid of war. The Chinese people understand that peace must be defended by struggle; the Chinese people also understand that one must use a club to deal with jackals. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people who have stood up have long seen through U.S. imperialism as a paper tiger. On the Korean battlefield, this paper tiger was beaten black and blue by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people. Now, the American bandit behavior is becoming clearer to the people of the world. All peace-loving people in the world stand on our side, sympathizing with and supporting our just actions. If the American aggressors dare to impose war on the Chinese people, then the American aggressors will not only be beaten black and blue, but the result will certainly be a devastating blow.
    Taiwan must be liberated, and Jinmen and Mazu must be liberated. The victorious red flag will forever be held high in the hands of the Chinese people! Compatriots! Comrades! Let us shout three times:
    We must liberate the territory of Taiwan!
    We must liberate the territory of Taiwan!
    We must liberate the territory of Taiwan!

　　民建中央主委黄炎培高声三呼：我们一定要解放台湾
　　广大的亲爱的同胞们！同志们！
    今天，首都各界人民在天安门集会，拥护周恩来总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，坚决反对美帝国主义的军事挑衅。我代表中国民主建国会全体会员向大会保证：我们决心行动起来，同全国人民一道，为解放自己的领土，为彻底粉碎美国的军事挑衅而斗争！
    台湾和澎湖列岛、金门、马祖等沿海各岛，都是中国的领土，解放自己的领土是中国人民神圣不可侵犯的权利，任何国家不能干涉。中国人民尤其不能容忍在自己的大陆内海中存在着像金门、马祖这些沿海岛屿的直接威胁。中国人民热爱和平，但决不怕战争，中国人民懂得和平必须用斗争来保卫；中国人民也懂得，对付豺狼，要用棍子。在中国共产党的领导下，站起来了的中国人民早已看穿美帝国主义是纸老虎，在朝鲜战场上，这个纸老虎曾经给中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民打得头破血流。现在，美国的强盗行为越来越被世界人民看清楚了，全世界一切爱好和平的人民都站在我们这一边，同情和支持我们的正义行动。美国侵略者如果敢于把战争强加在中国人民的头上，那末美国侵略者不但头破血流，结果一定遭到毁灭性的打击。
    台湾一定要解放，金门、马祖一定要解放。胜利的红旗永远高举在中国人民的手里！同胞们！同志们！让我们高声三呼：
    我们一定要解放领土台湾！
    我们一定要解放领土台湾！
    我们一定要解放领土台湾！
