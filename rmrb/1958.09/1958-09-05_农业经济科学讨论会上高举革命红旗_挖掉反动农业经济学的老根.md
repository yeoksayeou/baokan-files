    Holding High the Revolutionary Red Flag at the Agricultural Economics Science Symposium
    Uprooting the Old Roots of Reactionary Agricultural Economics

    (Our report) From August 1st to 20th, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences held a national agricultural economics science symposium in Beijing. The symposium held high the revolutionary red flag and conducted a comprehensive exposure and profound criticism of bourgeois academic thought in agricultural economics science, mainly the so-called agricultural economics "theories" of the imperialist element John Lossing Buck and his disciples in China.

    Mobilizing the Masses, Multi-pronged Attack

    The meeting fully mobilized the masses, with a firm and clear stance, and diverse and lively methods. Some systematically analyzed and criticized various arguments of bourgeois agricultural economics, while others dug up their historical roots and listed the genealogy of their various schools. Practical workers and working farmers from the countryside also broke the mysterious concept of academic criticism and used their own knowledge, what they had seen with their own eyes, and concrete and vivid realistic materials to powerfully refute bourgeois scholars. Professors criticized professors, and students criticized teachers. Finally, some who had been deceived and confused by bourgeois theories began to wake up.

    Buck was originally a cultural spy of American imperialism, taught at the former Jinling University in Nanjing for more than 20 years, and employed a group of servants to conduct some hypocritical investigations in rural China, writing three reactionary books. These mainly promoted bourgeois "population theory," "law of diminishing returns of land products," "tenant farmer superiority theory," "fair rent theory," and so on. They used these deceptive "theories" as weapons to serve imperialist aggression against China, maintain feudal rule, and oppose the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people. After liberation, some of Buck's disciples continued to sell this set of bourgeois goods in various covert ways, opposing land reform, agricultural cooperation, and the great leap forward in agricultural production; some even openly opposed the Party's policies.

    The meeting pointed out that their set of landlord and bourgeois "theories" had long been shattered by the reality of the Chinese revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong over the past nearly 30 years and by Marxist-Leninist theory.

    Zhang Guishun, director of the Shashiyu Agricultural Cooperative in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, felt that the bourgeois "population theory" was a great insult to the working people when he heard it at the meeting. He said with great indignation: "They look at the working people with the eyes of landlords and the bourgeoisie, thinking that more people are a harm; we believe that people are invaluable treasures. In the great leap forward in agricultural production, we have even more clearly seen this truth, that is: human power is inexhaustible, and land power is infinite." He listed that the population of Shashiyu Village increased from 480 to 520 from liberation to 1956, an increase of 40 people. Grain production increased from the original 90,000 jin to 350,000 jin. According to the production increase targets of this year's great leap forward, the total grain output is expected to reach about 1.8 million jin. He said: "Our village has increased grain production nearly 20 times in the ten years since liberation, and the population has increased by less than one-tenth."

    Pseudo-Science Completely Bankrupted

    Some bourgeois scholars and professors, in order to deceive young people, flaunted the "pure objectivity" of science, saying that "although Buck's theory is wrong, the methods are still acceptable and the data is still useful." At the symposium, people listed a large number of facts to show that Buck's position and viewpoint were bourgeois, the method was also thoroughly idealistic, and the data was also false. Some people at the meeting came out as rural investigators organized by Buck to prove that the rural survey of ten counties they conducted in Sichuan in the past was completely a deceptive trick. At that time, there was a lot of survey material proving that Buck's "fair rent theory" was not "fair," so they simply discarded the part of the material that violated their subjective intentions. Someone at the meeting also provided a photograph, which was a candid shot of their investigation activities: accompanying Buck to conduct the investigation with the farmers were armed militiamen, imposing baojia chiefs, and smug landlord masters. In front of these people, would the farmers dare to tell the truth? What scientific value would the materials obtained from such an investigation have?

    Sun Yefang, director of the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, reviewed at the meeting the history of the struggle between the two roads in the field of agricultural economics since 1927.

    Destroy the Old to Establish the New

    Liu Ruilong, Vice Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture, spoke three times at the meeting. He pointed out that it was very necessary and timely to pull up white flags and insert red flags in this scientific symposium and carry out the struggle between the two roads on the agricultural economic science front. He said that this struggle had been going on for a long time. In the democratic revolution stage, our Party advocated solving the land problem of peasants by revolutionary methods, while imperialists, the landlord class, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and bourgeois scholars tried their best to oppose it. In the socialist revolution stage, our Party advocated that agriculture should take the road of cooperation and collectivization, while bourgeois scholars advocated taking the capitalist road. The struggle has been going on for a long time, and the camps are very clear. He called on agricultural economic science workers across the country to continue to carry out this struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eradicate bourgeois ideology in a deep and extensive way, and we must pull up all the white flags and plant red flags all over this scientific field.

    Regarding how agricultural economic science workers should work in the correct direction in the future, Vice Minister Liu Ruilong emphasized: (1) Agricultural economic science work must put politics in command, and theoretical work must take the actual class struggle and production struggle as the starting point, and serve the great leap forward in agricultural production and socialist construction well. (2) We must systematically study Comrade Mao Zedong's works and take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle to carry out agricultural economic research and teaching. (3) We must continue to criticize bourgeois ideology and revisionism and overcome dogmatism. (4) We must go deep into the countryside and into reality, carry out labor training, and transform our ideology. Now we must be determined to go to the countryside, and in the process of living and working with the peasants, we must conduct investigations and research on the people's communes and the production and living conditions of the peasants, and serve the great leap forward in agriculture. (5) The content of the agricultural economics courses in schools must take the documents of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's works as the main teaching materials and the guiding ideology for compiling teaching materials. Immediately start compiling Chinese socialist agricultural economics textbooks. All regions must compile them, adopting the method of everyone working together, combining leadership and the masses, from top to bottom. (6) We must be determined to establish a strong theoretical team of agricultural economic science that is both red and expert.

    After the national agricultural economic science symposium, Beijing Agricultural University and other institutions of higher agricultural education, combined with the situation of their own units, successively launched an exposure and criticism of bourgeois academic thought in agricultural economic teaching and scientific research work.

    农业经济科学讨论会上高举革命红旗
　　挖掉反动农业经济学的老根
    本报讯　从8月1日到20日，中国农业科学院在北京召开了全国农业经济科学讨论会。讨论会上高举革命红旗，对农业经济科学中的资产阶级学术思想，主要是帝国主义分子卜凯及其在中国的门徒们的一套所谓农业经济学的“理论”进行了全面的揭发和深刻的批判。
    发动群众，几路围攻
    会议充分发动了群众，立场坚定明确，方式不拘一格，发言热烈，生动活泼。有的人针对资产阶级农业经济学的各种论点进行系统的分析和批判，有的则从历史上挖了他们的老根子，数出了他们各个流派的家谱。来自农村的实际工作者和劳动农民，也破除了学术批判的神秘观念，运用亲身所知、亲眼所见、具体生动的现实材料，给资产阶级学者以有力的批驳。教授批判教授，学生批判先生；最后，有些被资产阶级的理论所欺骗和迷惑的人，也开始醒悟过来。
      卜凯原是美帝国主义的一个文化特务，在南京前金陵大学任教二十余年，雇用了一批仆从，在中国农村进行了一些虚伪的调查，写了三大本反动的著作。主要是宣传资产阶级的“人口论”、“土地产品递减律”、“佃农优越论”、“公允地租论”等等。他们以这些骗人的“理论”作武器，来服务于帝国主义对中国的侵略，维护封建统治，反对中国人民的革命斗争。解放后，一些卜凯的门徒们仍然继续以各种隐蔽的方式，贩卖这一套资产阶级的私货，反对土地改革，反对农业合作化和农业生产大跃进，有的甚至公开与党的政策相对抗。
    会上指出，他们这一套地主、资产阶级的“理论”，早已被中国共产党和毛泽东同志所领导的近三十年来中国革命的现实和马列主义的理论所粉碎。
    河北省遵化县沙石峪农业社主任张贵顺，在会上听到资产阶级的“人口论”，感到是对劳动人民的一种极大的污辱，他十分愤慨地说：“他们用地主资产阶级的眼光来看待劳动人民，认为人多了是一害；我们却认为人是无价之宝。在农业生产大跃进中，我们更是看清了这条真理，就是：人力无尽，地力无穷。”他列举出，沙石峪村的人口，从解放到1956年，由四百八十人增加到五百二十人，共增加了四十人。粮食产量由原来的九万斤增加到三十五万斤。根据今年大跃进的增产指标，预计粮食总产量将达到一百八十万斤左右。他说：“我们村解放十年，粮食增产近二十倍，人口增加不足十分之一。”
    伪科学彻底破产了
    有些资产阶级的学者、教授为了欺骗青年，标榜出科学的“纯客观”性，说什么“卜凯的理论虽然是错误的，但方法还是可取的，资料还是有用的。”讨论会中，人们列举出大量事实，说明卜凯的立场、观点是资产阶级的，方法也是彻头彻尾的唯心主义的，资料也是虚伪的。会中有人以卜凯所组织的农村调查者的身份出来证明，过去他们在四川进行的十个县的农村调查，完全是一套骗人的鬼把戏。当时有许多调查材料证明卜凯的“公允地租论”并不“公允”，于是就把那一部分违背他们主观意图的材料干脆抛掉不用。会中还有人提供了一张照片，那是对他们进行调查活动的写真：陪同卜凯一起向农民进行调查的有持枪的团丁，威风凛凛的保甲长和神气十足的地主老爷。在这些人面前，农民敢说真心话吗？这样调查得来的材料，还会有什么科学价值吗？
    中国科学院经济研究所所长孙冶方在会上回溯了自1927年以来，在农业经济学领域中两条道路斗争的历史。
    破而后立
    中央农业部副部长刘瑞龙在会上先后作了三次发言。他指出，这次科学讨论会中拔白旗，插红旗，开展了农业经济科学战线上两条道路的斗争，很必要，很适时。他说这个斗争很早就在进行着，在民主革命阶段，我们党主张用革命的办法解决农民的土地问题，帝国主义、地主阶级、国民党反动派以及资产阶级学者用尽各种办法加以反对。在社会主义革命阶段，我们党主张农业应该走合作化、集体化的道路，资产阶级学者主张走资本主义道路。斗争时间很长，营垒非常分明。他号召全国农业经济科学工作者把这一场兴无灭资的斗争继续深入广泛地开展下去，一定要把这一科学领域内的白旗拔完，红旗插遍。
    对于农业经济科学工作者今后应该如何在正确的方向下进行工作，刘瑞龙副部长强调指出：（一）农业经济科学工作必须政治挂帅，理论工作必须以现实的阶级斗争和生产斗争作为出发点，很好地为农业生产大跃进、为社会主义建设服务。（二）要系统地学习毛泽东同志的著作，要以毛主席的思想为纲来进行农业经济的研究工作和教学工作。（三）要继续批判资产阶级思想和修正主义，克服教条主义。
  （四）要深入农村、深入实际，进行劳动锻炼，改造思想。现在要决心下乡，在和农民同生活、同劳动的过程中，进行人民公社和农民生产、生活情况的调查研究，为农业大跃进服务。（五）学校的农业经济学课程内容，都要以党中央的文件和毛泽东同志的著作作为主要教材和编写教材的指导思想。立即开始编写中国社会主义农业经济学教科书，各地都要编，采取大家动手，领导和群众上下结合的办法。（六）下决心建立起一支强大的又红又专的农业经济科学的理论队伍。
    全国农业经济科学讨论会结束后，北京农业大学等高等农业院校，结合本单位的情况，相继对农业经济教学和科学研究工作中的资产阶级学术思想展开了揭发和批判。
