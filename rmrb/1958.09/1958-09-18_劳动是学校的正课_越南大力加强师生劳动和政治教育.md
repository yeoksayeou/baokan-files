Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In the new academic year beginning September 4th, the Ministry of Education of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has put forward the slogan "Striving for a socialist school" to all levels of schools.

In order to realize this slogan, the Ministry of Education decided to vigorously strengthen labor education and political education for teachers and students, and stipulated that university and college students should attend three hours of political classes every week. Teachers in these schools should have one month of political study every year, and students from senior primary school to university should participate in one or two months of physical labor every year. These decisions have been enthusiastically supported by the majority of teachers and students in Vietnam.

After holding the opening ceremony recently, major universities and colleges in Vietnam also specially organized all teachers and students to begin a month of specialized political study. This study mainly includes two topics: "Cultural Revolution and Ideological Revolution" and "Socialist School." In the new academic year, labor classes have been listed as regular subjects in universities, colleges, middle schools, and senior primary schools. The scope of labor includes industrial and agricultural production, school construction, housework, and handicrafts. Universities also stipulate that students who fail the labor class cannot be promoted to the next grade. All schools presented a vibrant scene at the beginning of the new academic year. After two months of labor and literacy summer vacation, the students brought back to the school considerable achievements in production labor and literacy. They began to establish feelings with the working people; many weak bodies have also become stronger.

    劳动是学校的正课
    越南大力加强师生劳动和政治教育
    据新华社讯  在从9月4日开始的新学年里，越南民主共和国教育部向各级学校提出了“为建设社会主义的学校而奋斗”的口号。
    为了实现这个口号，教育部决定大力加强对教师和学生的劳动教育和政治教育，并且规定大中学校学生每周上三小时的政治课，这些学校的教师每年有一个月的政治学习，从高小到大学的学生每年要参加一两个月的体力劳动。这些决定得到越南广大师生的热烈支持。
    越南各大专学校最近在举行了开学典礼之后，还特地组织全校师生开始进行为期一个月的专门的政治学习。这次学习主要包括“文化革命和思想革命”和“社会主义学校”两个专题。在新学年中，劳动课已在大专学校、中学和高小里列为正课。劳动范围包括工农业生产、建校、家务劳动和手工艺等。大学还规定劳动课不及格的学生不得升班。各学校在新学年到来的时候都呈现了朝气蓬勃的景象。经过了两个月的劳动和扫盲的暑期生活，学生们带回学校来的是可观的生产劳动和扫盲的成绩。他们同劳动人民开始建立了感情；许多虚弱的身体也都变得结实了。
