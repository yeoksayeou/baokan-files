Xinhua News Agency, 3rd - Making a redoubled effort by the whole Party and all the people to ensure the completion of this year's steel production plan has become the center of action for Party and government leaders and the broad masses in the provinces and autonomous regions of North and East China.

The Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference for city and regional Party committees on the evening of the 1st. In order to guarantee the completion of the steel production task, the Provincial Party Committee required: first, to grasp leadership. Party committees at all levels should divide the battle lines, arrange forces, and immediately strengthen leadership over the two fronts of steel and agriculture. The first secretaries of local and county Party committees (counties with steel production tasks) must personally take command and go to the front line of steel production. Second, to grasp organization, local and county Party committees must organize steel command headquarters, and roughly divide them into several battlefields such as production, furnace construction, mining, and transportation. Third, to fully rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and clearly explain the province's steel production tasks to the broad masses and cadres, and mobilize the masses to jointly study methods. Fourth, to grasp production, all the small blast furnaces and indigenous furnaces that have been built must be put into normal production. At the same time, we must firmly grasp mining, transportation, and the supply of equipment and materials.

Shanxi Province has strengthened its leadership over steel production. Party committees at the provincial, regional, and municipal levels have established offices. The Provincial Party Committee has organized a working group and a technical guidance group of more than 800 people to summarize existing production and construction experience in various places, give full play to the potential of existing enterprises, and implement a policy of focusing on indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods. The Provincial Party Committee also proposed that for the issues of ore raw materials, power equipment, and transportation, a comprehensive planning and classification method should be adopted to ensure key points and resolutely complete the province's steel production tasks.

The Party and government leaders of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have adopted the method of "five grasps" to accelerate steel production. Currently, a mining army of 50,000 people in the region is mining iron ore. More than 30 small blast furnaces, more than 300 indigenous furnaces, and 18 steel converters that have been built have been put into normal production for more than half of them. The Autonomous Region Party Committee requires that through the "five grasps", the production plan of 150,000 tons of steel and 250,000 tons of iron will be completed by the end of the year. The "five grasps" are: grasping production, grasping raw materials, grasping equipment, grasping technology, and grasping transportation.

The Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to further adopt various effective measures to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's steel production plan based on the more than 38,000 various types of iron-smelting furnaces that have been built and the more than 21,000 tons of iron that have been produced. The Provincial Party Committee requires party committees at all levels to regard steel production as the overriding political task at present. At the same time, in addition to extensively accelerating the construction of various types of iron-smelting furnaces, we must also seize the construction of the Jinan Iron and Steel Plant and strive to make two 255-cubic-meter blast furnaces produce iron water in October, more than two months ahead of schedule.

The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference on the evening of September 2, calling on the whole Party to launch a high-yield steel competition in a fighting posture, completing steel production, metallurgical equipment manufacturing, and small blast furnace infrastructure tasks without missing a single jin, a single unit, or a single cubic meter, and striving to complete this year's steel production plan one month ahead of schedule. The Provincial Party Committee also put forward specific measures to ensure the completion of the September targets first: the construction of indigenous furnaces must universally implement the "five fixings" (fixing type, fixing group, fixing quantity, fixing personnel, and fixing system). Furnaces put into production should launch a large-scale high-yield competition. Leading cadres at all levels should lead dedicated lines and earnestly engage in experimental fields, cultivating as many workers as possible who can skillfully master iron-smelting and steel-making technologies. In terms of metallurgical equipment, the tasks of the central government, the East China Collaboration Zone, and the province and various regions must be completed on schedule and with quality, and the central government and the East China Collaboration Zone should be prioritized, followed by the province and then the local areas.

Party committees at all levels in Zhejiang Province have held emergency meetings to vigorously grasp steel production. Responsible comrades of party committees at all levels have gone to the mountains and factories. Their slogan is: "Don't leave the furnace until iron water flows, don't go down the mountain until iron ore is seen." The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee decided to take several measures to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the province's steel plan. The Provincial Party Committee also required each regional Party committee to do a good job in a key county before September 5, ensuring that all blast furnaces in the county are put into production. After September 5, each regional Party committee will hold on-site meetings to quickly popularize experience. After September 15, all 15,700 furnaces in the province will be put into production.

Anhui Province has adopted the method of unified leadership and comprehensive arrangement to accelerate the development of the steel industry. Now it has unified and organized relevant departments such as machinery, electricity, transportation, construction, materials, and commerce to implement comprehensive large-scale collaboration and establish a strong metallurgical industry command. Under the unified leadership of the metallurgical industry command, more than 160 machinery manufacturing plants in the province have been fully organized and are rushing to manufacture thousands of sets of metallurgical equipment day and night. Construction forces have been concentrated throughout the province. All civil buildings that can be postponed have been temporarily suspended or postponed. Various places have organized these construction forces into professional furnace building teams. The Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee on August 30 to review the development of the steel industry in the past week, make new arrangements in a timely manner, and formulate a production plan for September to December this year.

The Fujian Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held two telephone conferences to specifically deploy work. Now the first secretaries of party committees in various parts of the province are personally taking command, leading five-level cadres and energetic masses to attack steel in the mountains and factories. In order to accelerate the development of steel production, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee requires party committees in various places to first grasp iron production, immediately organize forces to go to various steel plants, help solve various problems in iron production, so that each steel furnace can produce normally, produce more iron, produce iron quickly, and produce good iron. At the same time, we must focus on building a new batch of steel-making furnace groups to ensure that without an ounce of steel, we will complete the province's steel production tasks this year without missing a single ton.

　　把钢产翻一番作为当前压倒一切的政治任务
　　华北华东摆开钢铁战斗阵势
    据新华社3日讯　全党全民加倍努力，保证完成今年的钢铁生产计划，成为了华北、华东各省、自治区党政领导和广大群众的行动中心。
    中共河北省委在1日晚召开了市、地委电话会议。为了保证完成钢铁生产任务，省委要求：第一要抓领导，各级党委要划分战线，安排力量，立即加强对钢铁、农业两个战线的领导。各地委、县委第一书记（有钢铁生产任务的县）都要亲自挂帅，亲临钢铁生产前线。第二要抓组织，地委、县委都要组织钢铁指挥部，并大体划分生产、建炉、采矿、运输等几个战场。第三要充分依靠群众，发动群众，把全省的钢铁生产任务向广大群众和干部交代清楚，发动群众共同研究办法。第四要抓生产，必须让所有已建成的小高炉和土炉投入正常生产，同时要紧紧地抓采矿、抓运输和抓设备材料的供应。
    山西省加强了对钢铁生产的领导，省、地、市各级党委已成立了办公室，省委并组织了八百多人的工作团和技术指导团，到各地总结已有的生产和建设经验，充分发挥现有企业的潜力，实行以土为主，土洋并举的方针。省委并提出对于矿石原料、动力设备和运输的问题，采取全面规划和分类排队的办法，保证重点，坚决完成全省钢的生产任务。
    内蒙古自治区党政领导采取“五抓”的办法，加速钢铁生产。现在，全区五万人的采矿大军正在开采铁矿石，已经建成的三十多座小高炉，三百多座土炉和十八座炼钢转炉，半数以上已经正常生产。自治区党委要求通过“五抓”，到年底完成十五万吨钢和二十五万吨铁的生产计划。“五抓”是：抓生产、抓原料、抓设备、抓技术、抓运输。
    中共山东省委决定在目前已建各种炼铁炉三万八千多座和已产生铁二万一千多吨的基础上，进一步采取各种有效措施，保证完成与超额完成今年的钢铁生产计划。省委要求各级党委把钢铁生产作为当前压倒一切的政治任务。同时，除了大量普遍地加速各种型号炼铁炉的兴建以外，还要抓紧济南钢铁厂的兴建工作，力争提前两个多月在10月间使两座二百五十五立方公尺的高炉流出铁水。
    中共江苏省委在9月2日晚间召开电话会议，号召全党以战斗的姿态，开展钢铁高产竞赛，一斤不少、一台不少、一立方公尺不少地完成钢铁生产、冶炼设备制造和小高炉基建任务，力争提前一个月完成今年钢铁生产计划。省委并提出了保证首先完成9月份指标的具体措施：土炉的建设要普遍实行“五定”（定型、定群、定量、定员、定制度）。投入生产的炉子要开展大面积的高额丰产竞赛。各级领导干部专线领导，并且切切实实地搞试验田，尽快尽多地培养出一批能熟练地掌握炼铁炼钢技术的工人。冶炼设备方面，中央、华东协作区和省以及各地区的任务都要按期按质完成，而且要先中央、华东协作区，然后省内再本地区。
    浙江省各级党委都召开了紧急会议，大抓钢铁生产。各级党委的负责同志已经上山下厂，他们的口号是：“不流铁水不离炉，不见铁矿不下山”。浙江省委决定采取几项措施，以确保全省钢铁计划的完成和超额完成。省委并且要求各个地委在9月5日前搞好一个重点县，保证全县所有的高炉投入生产。9月5日以后各地委分别召开现场会议，使经验迅速普及，15日后实现全省一万五千七百多个炉子全部投入生产。
    安徽省采取统一领导、全面安排的办法加速钢铁工业的发展。现在已经把机械、电力、交通、建筑、物资、商业等有关部门统一组织起来，实行全面大协作，成立了一个强有力的冶金工业指挥部。在冶金工业指挥部统一领导下、全省一百六十多个机械制造厂已全部组织起来，正在不分日夜地突击赶制上千套冶炼设备。全省各地已把建筑力量集中起来，一切可以缓建的民用建筑已经决定暂时停止或推迟，各地已将这些建筑力量组织专业的建炉队。中共安徽省委在8月30日举行了常委扩大会议，检查了最近一周来钢铁工业发展情况，及时作了新的部署，并拟出今年9月至12月的生产计划。
    中共福建省委两次召开电话会议，具体部署工作。现在全省各地党委第一书记都在亲自挂帅，率领五级干部和干劲十足的广大群众，上山下厂猛攻钢铁。为了加速发展钢铁生产，福建省委要求各地党委首先抓住铁的生产，立即组织力量到各个钢铁厂去，帮助解决炼铁生产中的各种问题，使每个钢铁炉都能正常地生产，做到多出铁、快出铁、出好铁。同时要有重点地新建一批炼钢炉群，保证在没有一两钢的基础上，一吨也不少地完成今年全省的钢铁生产任务。
