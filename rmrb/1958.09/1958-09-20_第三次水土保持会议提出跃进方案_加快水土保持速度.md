Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, September 19th: The Third National Soil and Water Conservation Conference, which concluded here on the 17th, formulated a Great Leap Forward plan for soil and water conservation work next year, striving for high-speed development of soil and water conservation work.

The 470 representatives from 25 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities participating in the conference spent more than a month focusing on visiting advanced areas of soil and water conservation in Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces, and held on-site meetings in Wushan and Lanzhou. Representatives from various regions made typical introductions at the meeting and fully exchanged advanced experiences. Chen Zhengren, Director of the National Soil and Water Conservation Committee, made a summary report on the last day of the meeting. Soviet expert Zaslavsky gave a report on soil and water conservation work.

The meeting believes that in 1958, the national soil and water conservation work has made unprecedented progress. According to statistics, in the eleven months since the Second National Soil and Water Conservation Conference, the national area under control for soil erosion has reached 260,000 square kilometers, which is 70,000 square kilometers more than the total workload of the past eight years, exceeding the original plan for 1958 by two times.

One of the major characteristics of recent soil and water conservation work is the development from point governance to large-scale governance, and from simple governance to an advanced stage of fully utilizing water resources and fundamentally transforming mountainous areas. Such high-speed development of soil and water conservation work has played a significant role in reducing flood flow, retaining silt, increasing grain production, and reducing the area affected by disasters. In the rainy season this year, Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces in the middle reaches of the Yellow River alone retained more than 200 million cubic meters of silt; Gansu, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces retained 28.2 billion cubic meters of runoff, ensuring an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production. According to preliminary statistics from nine provinces including Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, and Jiangxi, grain production increased by 23.6 billion jin this year due to soil and water conservation. The northwestern provinces, which have always been considered low-yield areas, have shed their low-yield label this year and are advancing alongside other provinces across the country.

The meeting determined the task of high-speed development of national soil and water conservation work in 1959, and at the same time stipulated the standards for high standardization of soil and water conservation, namely: afforestation of mountainous areas, terracing of slopes, transforming gullies into level land, and irrigation of cultivated land, so that the mountains and rivers of the country will be beautified. The meeting pointed out that in 1959, the national soil and water conservation work should still focus on the areas in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, such as Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Ningxia, and Qinghai. In order to cooperate with the early completion of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, thoroughly change the face of the loess plateau hilly areas, and ensure high and stable yields in agricultural production, it is required that the area of soil erosion in these areas be basically under preliminary control by 1959.

At the closing ceremony of the Third National Soil and Water Conservation Conference, the National Soil and Water Conservation Committee also awarded flags to 145 advanced units in soil and water conservation.

    第三次水土保持会议提出跃进方案
    加快水土保持速度
    据新华社兰州19日电　17日在这里闭幕的全国第三次水土保持会议，制订了明年水土保持工作跃进方案，力争水土保持工作的高速度发展。
    参加会议的二十五个省、自治区、市的四百七十位代表在一个多月中重点参观了河南、陕西、甘肃等省水土保持的先进地区，并在武山、兰州两地先后举行了现场会议。各地代表在会上作了典型介绍，充分交流了先进经验。全国水土保持委员会主任陈正人在会议最末一天作了总结报告。苏联专家扎斯拉夫斯基作了有关水土保持工作的报告。
    会议认为，1958年全国水土保持工作已经取得史无前例的进展，据统计，从全国第二次水土保持会议以来的十一个月中，全国控制水土流失面积达二十六万平方公里，比近八年工作量的总和还多七万平方公里，超过1958年原定计划的两倍。
    近来水土保持工作的重大特点之一，就是由点的治理发展到大面积的治理，从单纯的治理跃进到充分利用水利资源、根本改造山区的高级阶段。像这样高速度的发展水土保持工作，对于减少洪水流量，拦蓄泥沙，增产粮食，缩小成灾面积都起了显著作用。仅黄河中游的陕西、山西两省，今年雨季即拦蓄泥沙两亿公方以上；甘肃、陕西、河南三省拦蓄径流达二百八十二亿公方，保证了农业生产的空前丰收。据甘肃、陕西、河南、江西等九省的初步统计，今年由于水土保持而增产的粮食就达二百三十六亿斤。过去一直被认为是低产地区的西北各省，今年已摘掉低产帽子，正在同全国其他各省并肩前进。
    会议确定了1959年全国水土保持工作高速度发展的任务，同时规定了水土保持高标准化的标准即：山区园林化，坡地梯田化，沟壑川台化，耕地水利化，使全国的山河都美化起来。会议指出：1959年全国水土保持工作仍应以黄河中上游的甘肃、内蒙古、山西、陕西、河南、宁夏、青海等地区为重点。为了配合三门峡水库的提前建成，彻底改变黄土高原丘陵地区的面貌，保证农业生产的高产稳收，要求这些地区的水土流失面积在1959年内基本上做到初步控制。
    全国水土保持委员会在全国第三次水土保持会议的闭幕式上，还分别授予一百四十五个水土保持先进单位以奖旗。
