    Plastic Car
    The First Ministry of Machine Building Automotive Research Institute and the Nanjing Chemical Plant have successfully trial-produced China's first car with a plastic body.
    The car body's top cover is cream-colored, and the car's hood, doors, rear fenders, and trunk lid are light green, with beautiful and harmonious colors. The car body weighs 87 kilograms, only half the weight of a steel-plate car body of the same size. Because the body weight is reduced, the engine efficiency can be improved, the load capacity can be increased, and fuel consumption can be reduced. The car body has strong impact resistance, comparable to that of a steel-plate car body. This type of car body has thermal insulation properties, keeping the interior warm in winter and cool in summer, and has waterproof, fireproof, rustproof, and acid-resistant properties.

    塑料汽车
    第一机械工业部汽车研究所和南京化工厂试制成功我国第一辆以塑料作车身的汽车。
    这部汽车车身顶盖是奶油色，车头、车门、后翼子板和行李箱盖是浅绿色，颜色美观谐和。汽车车身重八十七公斤，只有同样大小的钢板汽车车身的一半重。由于车身重量减轻，可以提高发动机效率，增加载重量，减少耗油量。汽车车身耐冲击性能很强，可与钢板汽车车身相比。这种汽车车身具有隔热性能，车内冬暖夏凉，并具有防水、防火、防锈、防酸等性能。
