    An Unnamed Comrade
    A reader named De Pu wrote a letter about the following incident: He wrote a letter to Aunt Wang next door, asking her mother, who lives in Shashi, to come to Wuchang within a week. The next day, Aunt Wang went to the market to sell vegetables and accidentally lost the letter, feeling very frustrated. To her surprise, two days later, her mother replied, saying that she had received her letter and decided to take a bus. What happened? It turned out that an unnamed comrade had picked up the letter, paid for postage, and mailed it for her.
    A drop of water can reflect the sun. Through this small incident, we can see how people in our society care for and help each other everywhere, and what a completely new relationship exists between people.

    不知名的同志
    有一位叫德普的读者来信谈到这样一件事：他给隔壁王嫂写了一封信，要她住在沙市的母亲在一个星期内来武昌。第二天王嫂上街卖菜，不慎把信丢了，心里很懊丧，谁知过了两天，母亲回信来了，说已收到她的信，决定乘汽车来。这是怎么回事呢？原来是一位不知名的同志拾到这封信，代她掏钱买了邮票投了邮。
    一滴水可以反映太阳，透过这件小事，可以看到在我们这个社会里，人们是怎样处处关心着别人，成全着别人，人和人之间又是怎样一种完全新的关系。
