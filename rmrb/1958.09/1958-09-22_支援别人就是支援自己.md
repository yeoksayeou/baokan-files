Supporting Others is Supporting Yourself
Cheng Pu

The comprehensive organization of industrial and agricultural cooperation in Jinning County, Yunnan Province, has effectively resolved many difficulties for both industry and agriculture, creating a comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. This is a good experience. It tells people that socialist construction cannot be separated from cooperation at any time. In smooth times, in difficult times, between regions, between units, and even between different production departments, cooperation should be maximized.

At present, industrial and agricultural production in many places is facing the difficulty of a serious shortage of labor. In addition, both industry and agriculture have their own specific difficulties, such as the promotion of new agricultural tools lagging behind production needs, insufficient fertilizer supply, and so on in agriculture. The lack of raw materials in local industry, and insufficient understanding of mineral resources, etc., are all urgent difficulties to be overcome. Organizing comprehensive industrial and agricultural cooperation is one of the important ways to overcome these difficulties.

Some comrades with narrow vision often see supporting others as being in opposition to doing their own work well, which is wrong. In fact, in the socialist era, supporting others is also supporting oneself. First, everyone is one family, working for the same goal. The work of others is, in the final analysis, also one's own work. Second, even from the direct interests of one's own job, supporting others is not always only beneficial to the other party, but often beneficial to both parties. Taking the difficulties of industry and agriculture listed above as an example, if the two parties do not participate in cooperation, then their own difficulties will always be their own difficulties, and it may not be possible to overcome them quickly even with great effort. But the situation is different when everyone cooperates closely. Once there is cooperation, mutual exchanges become frequent, and each side understands the other's current difficulties and urgent needs. By brainstorming together, many solutions can be found. The task of one region or one department actually becomes the common task of several regions or several departments. Everyone had many difficulties originally, but now everyone's difficulties are resolved. This is called "one plus one equals three." In the case of a shortage of labor, the rural areas of Jinning County transferred 10,000 people to support local industry, and the local industrial departments produced 70,000 new agricultural tools, more than 500,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, and 90,000 tons of local fertilizer for the rural areas in two months. As a result, the difficulty of labor shortage on both sides has been initially resolved. Local industry supplied more than 80 water pumps to farmers in drought resistance, helping farmers overcome the worst drought in decades. Later, a massive mass movement to support industry was launched in the countryside. Under the slogan of "Give whatever is needed, contribute whatever is available!" farmers actively searched for and reported mineral deposits, and offered materials for sale. As a result, the work of both sides progressed rapidly.

Due to the different specific conditions of various regions and departments, some things are very difficult to do here, but can be done easily there. For example, if industrial departments want to generally find mines and collect raw materials, they must pay a lot of manpower and material resources. If the peasant masses are mobilized to find and report mineral deposits, and collect scrap copper and iron, the peasants can easily do these things in their spare time from production. There are many such things. Cooperation should be especially organized for such things.

    支援别人就是支援自己

    云南省晋宁县组织工农业全面协作，使工农业双方的许多困难都得到有效的解决，形成了工农业生产全面跃进的局面，这是个好经验。它告诉人们：社会主义建设任何时候也离不开协作，在顺利的时候，在困难的时候，在地区与地区之间，单位与单位之间，以至不同的生产部门之间，都应当尽量协作。
    目前许多地方的工农业生产都面临着劳动力严重不足的困难。除此以外，工业和农业双方还各有自己的一些具体困难，比如农业方面新式农具的推广赶不上生产的需要、肥料供应不足等等。地方工业方面原材料缺乏，对矿产资源情况掌握不够等等，都是急需克服的困难。组织工农业全面协作，是克服困难的重要途径之一。
    有一些眼光狭窄的同志，时常把支援别人和做好自己的工作对立起来，这是不对的。事实上，在社会主义时代，支援别人也就是支援自己。第一、大家都是一家人，都是为着一个目的而工作。别人的工作，归根结底也是自己的工作。第二、就以自己岗位工作的直接利害来说，支援别人也并不常是只对对方有好处，而往往是对双方都有利。就拿上面列举的工农业双方的那些困难来说，如果双方不参加协作，那么，自己的困难，始终是自己的困难，自己费很大的力气，也不一定都能很快克服。可是大家亲密协作起来，情况就不同了。一协作，彼此的交往频繁了，互相都了解到对方当前的困难和迫切需要，共同动脑筋，就能想出许多办法。一个地区、一个部门的任务，实际上就变成了几个地区、几个部门的共同任务。原来大家都有许多困难，现在大家的困难都解决了。这叫做“一加一等于三”。晋宁县农村在劳动力不足的情况下抽调了一万人支援地方工业，而地方工业部门在两个月里就为农村生产了七万件新式农具、五十多万吨磷肥和九万吨土化肥。结果，双方劳动力不足的困难都得到了初步的解决。地方工业在农民抗旱中供应了八十多部抽水机，帮助农民战胜了几十年来所没有的大旱。后来农村中就展开了声势浩大的支援工业的群众运动。农民在“要什么给什么，有什么出什么！”的口号下，踊跃找矿报矿，献料售料。结果双方的工作都迅速地前进了。
    由于各个地区、各个部门的具体条件不同，有些事情在这里做起来很不容易，在那里却不费多大力气就可以做成。比如工业部门要普遍找矿，收集原材料，必须付出很大的人力物力才行。如果发动农民群众找矿报矿，收集废铜烂铁，农民们利用生产的空隙，就能很容易地顺手做好这些事情。这类事情很多。对于这样的事情就特别应当组织协作。
