    March of the Liberation of Taiwan
    Tian Han

    The waves of the Taiwan Strait are churning, and the elders on the island are groaning. To liberate Taiwan, the territory of the motherland, as soon as possible is the unanimous call of the Chinese people. The heinous American imperialists vainly attempt to interfere in our internal affairs, trying to provoke the Chinese people with fleets, planes, and nuclear weapons. Every Chinese person can no longer tolerate this, and peace-loving people all over the world can no longer tolerate it! The pirates must get out, and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops must surrender. If the American imperialists dare to launch a war, we will definitely repay them with double the force! Victory will never belong to aggressors and traitors, but to the great and righteous Chinese people! Compatriots, the motherland is calling you. Let us launch satellites on every front; let us tighten the noose around the necks of the invaders; we must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Matsu, and Kinmen, so that our compatriots who have suffered hardships can bathe in the light of the motherland together, promote the giant wheel of the times, crush all obstacles and brambles, and advance rapidly towards the highest ideal society of mankind, forward, forward!

    台湾解放进行曲
    田汉海峡的波涛在翻腾，岛上的父老们在呻吟，早日解放祖国领土台湾，是中国人民一致的呼声。万恶的美帝国主义妄想干涉我国内政，企图用舰队、飞机、核武器，向中国人民挑衅，每一个中国人民再也不能容忍，全世界爱好和平的人民再也不能容忍！海盗们必须滚蛋，蒋匪军必须归顺，美帝胆敢发动战争，我们一定加倍地回敬，胜利永不属于侵略者和卖国贼，而属于伟大的正义的中国人民！同胞们，祖国在召唤你们，让我们在每一条战线上放出卫星；让我们在侵略者的脖子上，勒紧绞绳；我们一定要解放台湾，澎湖，马祖，金门，让备尝苦难的同胞们同浴祖国的光明，推动时代的巨轮，碾平一切阻碍、荆榛，向人类最高的理想社会，飞速前进，前进！
