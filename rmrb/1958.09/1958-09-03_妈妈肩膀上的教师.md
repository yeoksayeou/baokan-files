　　Teacher on Mother's Shoulders
    Evening. In the people's school of Li Peng Cooperative in Liancheng, Fujian. A paralyzed young man, carried by an old woman on her back, slowly entered the classroom. He sat in the chair in front of the blackboard and began his once-a-day teaching life.
    The young man is called Li Shuiwang, nineteen years old. The old woman is Li Shuiwang's mother, named Lin Xiufeng. Li Shuiwang contracted rheumatism at the age of ten. Because his family was poor and had no money for treatment, he became paralyzed. After liberation, his family was allocated land, and life improved. He began to think: I can't go on like this, I should do some work for everyone to repay the Party and the people. But he was paralyzed and could not move an inch. What to do? After thinking about it, he decided to first get rid of illiteracy. With culture, he could always do something for everyone. Once he made up his mind, his mother was deeply moved. From then on, rain or shine, Lin Xiufeng always carried a kerosene lamp and carried Li Shuiwang to night school every night. In this way, Li Shuiwang's wish was finally realized. Now, he can not only read popular books and newspapers, but also write short essays and use dictionaries.
    The tide of the cultural revolution is impacting the heart of this young man. In order to contribute his knowledge to the working people, he resolutely took on the role of literacy teacher in the people's school. From then on, Li Shuiwang, as in the past, was carried by his mother to the people's school every night to teach. He never interrupted, never was late. Sometimes dinner was late, so he went to class hungry. (Fu Qing)

　　妈妈肩膀上的教师
    傍晚。在福建连城李彭社的民校里。一个瘫痪的青年人，让一位老大娘背着，慢慢地步入了教室。他，坐在黑板前的椅子上，开始了一天一次的教学生活。
    青年人叫李水旺，十九岁。老大娘就是李水旺的母亲，叫林秀凤。李水旺十岁那年，就得了风湿症。因为家贫，无钱医治，成了瘫痪。解放后，他家分了地，生活好了。他开始想到：不能老这样下去，应当为大家作些工作，来报答党和人民。但自己是个瘫痪，寸步难移，怎么办呢？想来想去，决定第一步先摘掉文盲帽子，有了文化，总能给大家办点事。决心一下，使他的母亲深受感动。从此，不管刮风下雨，林秀凤每晚总是提着马灯，背李水旺去上夜校。就这样，李水旺的愿望终于实现了。现在，他不但能看通俗书报，还会写短文、查字典了。
    文化革命的浪潮，冲击着这个年轻人的心。为了把自己的知识贡献给劳动人民，他又毅然地担任了民校的扫盲教师。从此，李水旺又像过去一样，每天晚上由母亲背着到民校教课。他，从不间断，从不迟到。有时晚饭作迟了，他就饿着肚子去上课。　（福青）
