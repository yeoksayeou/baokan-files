　　Rescuing a Sick Child

    In Heping Township, Chaoyang District, a moving story of college students rescuing a sick child's life is circulating.

    One day, Wang Liyang, a medical student from Beijing Medical College and a Communist Party member who was doing labor training in Heping Township, heard that a child in the village had contracted toxic dysentery. He immediately rushed to the child's home for treatment. At that time, the child was already in a coma, with a pale face and clenched teeth.

    Wang Liyang was determined to save the child's life! According to the books, patients with toxic dysentery are difficult to cure after entering a coma, and can only be rescued by methods such as infusion and oxygen. But the countryside did not have these conditions. Suddenly, Wang Liyang remembered that traditional Chinese medicine had methods for treating comatose diseases, so he could treat the coma first and then carry out other treatments. So he ran to a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner's home and asked him to perform acupuncture on the sick child. He stayed by his side, carefully observing the changes in the condition. Suddenly, with a "wah" sound, the child cried out. Wang Liyang quickly gave the child chloromycetin. From then on, the child's temperature dropped, and the condition improved day by day, and finally fully recovered.

    To treat toxic dysentery, it is necessary to combine Chinese and Western medicine. This is a valuable treatment method that Beijing Medical College students found after going deep into the countryside, which was not available in previous textbooks. When compiling the teaching syllabus, the students plan to add the issue of cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine to enrich the teaching content.

　　抢救病儿
    在朝阳区和平乡里，流传着大学生抢救病儿生命的感人事迹。
    有一天，正在和平乡劳动锻炼的北京医学院医疗系学生、共产党员王力扬，听说村里有个孩子得了中毒性痢疾，他立即赶到病儿的家里就诊。当时，孩子已经昏迷，面色苍白，牙关紧闭。
    王力扬决心要救活这个孩子！按书本上说，中毒性痢疾的患者进入昏迷状态后是很难治好的，只能进行输液、输氧等方法来进行挽救。但是农村里又没有这些条件，忽然，王力扬他想起中医对治疗昏迷病症是有办法的，先治好昏迷后再进行治疗。于是他跑到一个中医家里，请他为病儿进行了针灸，他守在身旁，细心地观察着病情变化。只听“哇”的一声，孩子哭出声来了。王力扬连忙给病儿服下合霉素。从此，孩子的体温下降，病情一天天好转，最后全愈了。
    治疗中毒性痢疾，要中西医结合治疗，这是北京医学院学生们深入到农村以后，才找到了以前课本上没有的宝贵的治疗方法。学生们在编写教学大纲时，准备把中西医合作的问题加进去，充实教学内容。
