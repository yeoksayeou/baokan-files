He first expressed a warm welcome and cordial greetings to the victorious returning CPV officers and soldiers. Cheng Shicai, the deputy head of the welcoming delegation and head of the leading organ of the Shenyang garrison, said in his speech about the situation in the Taiwan Strait area that if the imperialists insist on imposing war on our heads, we are determined to wipe them out cleanly and thoroughly.

He said that although U.S. imperialism is stepping up its creation of a tense situation in the Far East, the Chinese People's Volunteers are still resolutely withdrawing from Korea according to the original plan. This fully demonstrates the Chinese people's sincerity in seeking peace and their infinite confidence in their own strength.

General Tang Jinlong said that after we return to the motherland, we are ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland and, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate the aggressors who dare to provoke war.
