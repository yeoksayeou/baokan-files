　　In our report, we will discuss the main experiences of the international student movement and the work issues of the International Student Union.
　　The International Student Union has always believed that although students have their own special problems, they are (at the same time an integral part of the whole society), and they are linked to the whole society in many interests and obligations.
　　We are proud to live in an era of such historically significant events. We have reason to be proud of the active contributions made by students in many countries to the achievements of mankind in recent years. We believe that future historians who write the history of our time will not ignore the significant role played by students, together with their people, in their efforts to avoid the danger of nuclear war and to liberate their motherland from colonial rule.
　　We pay our highest respect to the students who have contributed their lives in the struggle to defend the interests of students and the people, and we warmly salute the students who have been imprisoned and persecuted for their struggle for freedom, peace, and independence.

    The Role of Students in Maintaining Peace
　　Today, military expenditures in many countries have reached astronomical figures, while funding for education, culture, and science remains far from satisfactory. For example, the money France spent on the Algerian War in twelve days would be enough for the annual study expenses of 100,000 French students. Last year, the Federal Republic of Germany spent 50 million marks to develop new-style tanks and 60 million marks to establish an aeronautical research institute, while the West German Student Union's proposal for an education budget of 120 million marks for the 1957-58 academic year was only allocated 30 million marks by the government (of which only 18 million marks were loans). This shows how heavy the military burden imposed on the people of all countries is, and how much benefit would be brought to cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings if disarmament agreements could be reached and international tensions eased.
　　Recently, the question of peace and war has become so acute that students realize that it has gone beyond the point of merely improving material conditions. The very existence and continuous development of atomic and hydrogen bombs, with their enormous destructive power, endangers the entire learning and future problems of our generation. Students absorb the knowledge accumulated by mankind throughout the ages in the course of their studies, so that after graduation, they can build houses, construct dams, treat patients, explore more of the earth's resources, educate children, and engage in artistic creation—in a word, use knowledge to serve mankind. Who can willingly allow these plans to be destroyed by inventions and discoveries that could have opened up infinitely broad paths for a happy and prosperous life for mankind? This is one of the dramatic problems facing all of humanity, especially youth and intellectuals, in our time. No one can escape this question and hide forever in the valleys of apolitical or pure science.
　　People recognize that with their resolutions and firm actions, they can eliminate this threat, and they have therefore launched a broad mass movement to stop the dangerous race that could lead to catastrophic atomic war. There is no doubt that most students are against atomic war. Some student leaders believe that the peace issue is too politicized and can only widen the rifts in the student movement. We believe, and facts have proven, that this is not necessarily the case and will not be the case. Joint student action is possible if we first focus all our efforts on the common demands of students with different ideological views in various countries, namely: the immediate cessation of nuclear testing and the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons. Efforts to achieve this goal have united many student organizations that have taken joint action and are supported by a wide range of students. For example, in Japan, where people acutely feel the serious consequences of atomic and hydrogen bombs in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Bikini Island, the struggle for peace is the most prominent feature of the student movement. The Rangoon University Student Union, in its appeal to major powers, expressed the sentiment of all Burmese students demanding the immediate cessation of testing and the prohibition of nuclear weapons. The Brazilian National Student Union strongly opposes the lease of Brazil's Fernando de Noronha Island to the U.S. government as a missile base. The recent statements by student representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic are particularly important because they support the proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe. In West Germany, a student organization representing 50,000 students expressed opposition to equipping the "Bundeswehr" with nuclear weapons, and student organizations across the country organized demonstrations and rallies to prevent the implementation of this decision. In Britain, many universities held votes, and the results showed that most students opposed continuing nuclear weapons testing. In May, a national university peace conference was held in Birmingham, which passed a resolution regretting the British government's refusal to stop hydrogen bomb testing. These examples have shown that the movement to ban nuclear weapons testing and fundamentally prohibit these weapons of mass destruction is emerging in an increasingly active and widespread form, and it can become a focal point for uniting the widest range of student organizations with different tendencies.
　　More and more students are demanding international agreements on partial or complete disarmament in order to finally abolish military treaties. The Second Latin American Student Congress expressed the opposition of Latin American students to the policy of establishing military treaties and military bases, and to the attempt to establish a South Atlantic defense treaty. Many student organizations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America also oppose the establishment of military treaties and the arms race. Iraqi students, under the leadership of the General Union of Iraqi Students, have steadfastly carried out the struggle against the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine. In 1957, the congress of the National Union of Moroccan Students expressed the demand of Moroccan students for the cancellation of foreign military bases and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Morocco. Similarly, Tunisian students also support the government's demand for the withdrawal of French troops. Egyptian students took up arms to defend their motherland when it was invaded. Everyone must also know how resolutely students in Arab and many other countries stood together with Syrian students when they stood up against imperialist pressure and faced the danger of being invaded. Students in Korea, Vietnam, and Germany all demand the peaceful reunification of their countries, and the continued division of these countries may lead to serious international conflicts.
　　We also commend the support of students in many countries, such as India, Burma, and China, for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference.
　　The International Student Union has consistently guided students to pay attention to the issue of defending peace. The International Student Union should do the following in its future work:
　　1. Support all proposals (regardless of where they come from) that help strengthen the peace movement and lead to the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and the fundamental prohibition of nuclear weapons, and for this purpose, cooperate with all other organizations that are fighting for the same purpose.
　　2. At the same time, support various other forms of activities by student organizations to fight for peace, especially efforts to demand the cancellation of military treaties and military bases, the withdrawal of all foreign troops, the striving for comprehensive or partial disarmament, the demand for increased funding for education and reduced military spending, and the call for cooperation between the people and students of all countries.
　　3. Make further efforts to involve as many students and student organizations as possible in this common work, and serve to promote broad unity at home and abroad.
　　4. Publicize examples of students striving for peace, and frequently report on students' efforts and joint actions in this regard.
　　5. Encourage students to study and research how to peacefully utilize atomic energy and all other advanced scientific achievements, and for this purpose, organize various seminars to publicize their activities.
　　6. Promote mutual contact and understanding among students of various countries, and publicize the principles of peaceful coexistence and the concept of mutual respect.
　　7. Suggest that the International Student Week (November 10-17) be commemorated as the International Student Peace and Friendship Week in the future.
　　We believe that there is a real possibility of establishing peace and achieving broad student unity for this cause. The International Student Union calls on all national and international student organizations, regardless of any factors that may separate them, to cooperate in accomplishing this historic task.

    Students' Anti-Colonialism and Activities for National Independence
　　It is by no means an exaggeration to say that the students' struggle against colonialism and for national independence is one of the most prominent features of the student movement in the past two years. This struggle is not being carried out in isolation by colonial students, because they are supported by the vast majority of students around the world.
　　What are the reasons that prompted students to carry out this unyielding struggle? First, because they are under colonial rule, without the most basic human rights, they are determined to fight with the people for the overall struggle for national independence. Second, in addition to the difficulties encountered by students in many countries, colonial students also encounter some special obstacles: they cannot study in their native language, the curriculum is generally a complete copy of the suzerain state and is completely unsuitable for the needs of their people, they cannot choose subjects that are very important for the development of their national economy, and the number of departments—if they exist in colonial countries—is not sufficient to allow all talented young people to have the opportunity to study and receive the specialized training necessary to meet the needs of the country.
　　Colonial students are increasingly aware that in order to pave the way for the development of education and national culture, they must first break through the shackles of colonialism and take the destiny of the country into their own hands. Because students know the evils of colonialism from their own experience. They know through study that this situation can be changed. It is precisely because of this that the demands of the people of all countries have been expressed in the student movements of all countries, and the student movement has always been at the forefront of the struggle against colonialism and for national independence.
　　We can cite many recent examples. Algerian students under the leadership of the Algerian Student Union, with their spirit of perseverance, courage, and loyalty, fought alongside the people for the national independence of their severely tested motherland and won great international admiration and sympathy. The struggle of students in French Black Africa under the banner of the French Black African Student Union. At its eighth congress, the French Black African Student Union bravely exposed all attempts to cover up colonialism under various new guises, such as "Fundamental Law" or "Eurafrica," and emphasized that the only way to achieve freedom and African progress and unity and its cooperation with other countries is to carry out the struggle for national independence. In Cyprus, students were arrested and severely tortured, and many of them have sacrificed their lives in the long and decisive struggle for the right of self-determination for Cyprus, which has been fully supported by students in Greece and many other countries.
　　Colonial student organizations also carry out struggles against the various consequences of colonialism in culture and education. They first oppose unsuitable teaching content, which does not conform to the history of the people, distorts historical facts, erases the past history of their own people, and portrays colonial rulers as humanitarians and givers of civilization. The impression given to them is that their country has no culture, that they are barbaric and backward, and that in educational facilities, teaching is conducted through the language of the suzerain state, while the native language is regarded as a foreign language, or is rejected and suppressed. Illiteracy is another result of colonialism, which attempts to keep the people in a state of ignorance for a long time. Students condemn general racial discrimination and racial discrimination within schools, considering them to be obstacles to the democratization of education and social progress, and this condemnation constitutes another important part of the students' struggle to defend democratic rights. The Executive Committee meeting of the International Student Union in March 1957 unanimously adopted a special resolution condemning the South African government's discriminatory actions and expressing full support for the struggle of South African university and middle school students against racial segregation.
　　When discussing the issue of students' anti-colonialism, special attention should be paid to the issue of students studying abroad. As a result of the colonial teaching system, tens of thousands of students who want to go to university have to leave their home country. For example, in Nigeria, there are about 500 university students studying in the country, while there are more than 5,000 studying abroad. These students have to study in a foreign language, they are learning the culture of the suzerain state, which has nothing in common with their national culture, and the knowledge they learn does not meet the needs of their own country. Therefore, these students encounter many great mental and material difficulties. They establish their own organizations in order to ensure constant contact with the people of their own country, promote their national culture, and fight for the cause of the people of their own country, and defend their material and spiritual rights and needs. The International Student Union is the first, and perhaps even the only, international student organization that has consistently and unconditionally recognized them and provided them with all assistance in their struggle against colonialism and to improve their living and learning conditions.
　　In the past two years, the International Student Union has unhesitatingly implemented the principles stipulated in its charter and the resolutions adopted by the Fourth Congress in dealing with the issue of students' anti-colonialist struggle. The International Student Union must continue to hold high the banner of the anti-colonialist struggle, unyieldingly adhere to the anti-colonialist attitude, help all colonial student organizations, and mobilize students from other countries to support this struggle.

    Students Struggle to Eliminate the Consequences of Colonialism, Participate in National Construction, and Strive for Economic Independence
　　The student anti-colonial struggle is reflected not only in the struggle for national independence, but also in the efforts of students in newly independent countries to defend national sovereignty, eliminate the consequences of colonialism, and develop national culture and education. Developing and reforming the education cause, making it suitable for the new needs of the country, eradicating illiteracy, expanding the national culture, improving health conditions, overcoming the lack of experts, especially experts in science and scientific research, developing a national economy based on the country's natural resources, fully realizing the integrity of territorial sovereignty, canceling foreign military bases, and eliminating the unfavorable situations imposed on the country's political, social and economic aspects by colonialists.
　　Colonialists have exhausted many methods to spread pessimism to the anti-colonial people. They are actually creating a pessimistic atmosphere by hindering the national independent economic development of colonial countries, plundering their natural resources and wealth, and placing their people in extreme poverty. For example, after the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, they promoted everywhere that the Egyptian people did not have the ability to manage the Suez Canal. But the result was very different from what the imperialists predicted. Despite some doubts and despite many difficulties caused by the hostile actions of the colonialists, the Egyptian people took over the Suez Canal and managed it even better than before.
　　It is an important task to use its glorious history and current facts to encourage the patriotic spirit and self-confidence of students in newly independent countries. The International Student Union not only understands this development, but has always supported the students' struggle and helped them in many ways. We are very proud to see that because of our sincere, constant and unconditional support for the struggles and aspirations of students in these two continents, we have gained the trust of more student organizations in newly independent countries. It is no accident that many student organizations in these countries have joined the International Student Union.
　　Latin American students also have many similar problems related to the negative effects of colonialism and imperialism, although their situation is very different from that of Asian and African countries. They face great problems such as economic backwardness, the looting of these countries' natural resources by foreign monopoly capitalists, a high illiteracy rate, and military dictatorships serving foreign interests. Therefore, Latin American students declared at their Second Congress: "The solution to these problems depends on the effective economic adjustment and political and cultural unity of our countries, on the realization of land reform and the distribution of land to cultivators, on the nationalization and social ownership of natural resources and other wealth held by foreign enterprises, on the guarantee of international free trade, and the student movement will fight alongside the independent trade union organizations of our countries to achieve these goals, thereby maintaining the closest domestic and international unity with these organizations."
　　One of the most typical and prominent examples of Latin American student activities is the struggle of Brazilian students under the leadership of the Brazilian Student Union to defend natural oil resources, atomic minerals and hydroelectric power. The Venezuelan "University Front" was underground during the Perez Jimenez regime and played an extremely important role in the struggle to overthrow the dictator. Panamanian students within the Panamanian Student Union are paying very close attention to the Panama Canal Treaty issue. One of their main demands is for the government to amend this treaty, which places part of Panama under the jurisdiction of the United States. In many other countries, especially in Cuba, Paraguay, Nicaragua and Guatemala, students are standing at the forefront with the people to overthrow those regimes that rely on foreign support, hinder their country's political and economic development, and hinder the development of education. We are convinced that the students of this continent, together with the people, will achieve their goals, build their own motherland well, and eliminate all forms of backwardness. With their fighting spirit, they will surely be able to build their own country well and build them into a highly developed region using modern science and technology.

    Activities of Students to Demand Educational Reform, Defend Student Rights, and Improve Living and Learning Conditions
　　The implementation of educational democratization, the demand for improved material conditions, and the demand for democratic rights have long been one of the traditional and basic demands of student movements in countries around the world. One of them is: institutions of higher learning should open their doors to all talented young people. In many countries of the world, higher education is still the privilege of wealthy families, and it is difficult for the children of not very wealthy and middle-class families to go to university, as for the children of workers and peasants, although they are the most extensive class in the population, they only account for a very small number of students. For example, in French institutions of higher learning, the children of workers only account for 3.5% of the total number of students, and the children of rural families only account for 6%. In Greece, there are 18,000 students (in a population of 8 million, that is, only 2.25 university students per 1,000 people). These students not only cannot get state grants, but also have to pay high tuition fees, as a result, many students cannot go to university after finishing middle school, and only half of those who go to university graduate.
　　Socialist countries have taken interesting measures to implement the democratization of higher education, the important principle of these reforms is to implement a unified basic education system so that all children have the same learning process and the same opportunity to continue to improve their education. The admission standard is the student's actual talent and academic ability, not the financial resources of their family. In addition to this, every student can legally enjoy government grants, and tuition fees are completely free. In the German Democratic Republic, 90,000 full-time students are studying in 47 institutions of higher learning, while in 1949 there were only 30,000 students in 17 institutions of higher learning. 90% of full-time students enjoy grants. 56% of the students are from the working class. In Albania, where there was no institution of higher learning at all under the old regime, a national university has now been established, with a total of six departments and 3,300 students. Another important aspect of the democratization of higher education is to change the content of learning and the structure of institutions of higher learning to adapt to the needs of society and the country. Students also demand sufficient learning conditions and equipment, better accommodation conditions, recreational facilities and medical care, they further demand solutions to the problems faced by part-time students, and demand full opportunities for employment after graduation.
　　Another integral part of the democratization of education is to recognize students' democratic rights on and off campus. Therefore, students in many countries, especially in those places where these rights are deprived, are fighting for the realization of democratic rights and the concept of university democracy. The suppression of student organizations is in many cases directly related to the attack on their people. Therefore, students are carrying out fierce struggles against the suppression of their organizations. Therefore, the struggle for students' democratic rights cannot but be linked to their struggle for greater democracy.
　　The International Student Union expresses its support for students and student organizations who are defending democratic rights and organizes solidarity movements. The International Student Union has further expanded the scope of material support activities, in addition to helping the self-help activities of various countries, it has also helped more than 1,000 students with lung diseases to go to the Asian and African Student Sanatorium it opened in Beijing for treatment in the past three years. We would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks to the doctors and other staff of the sanatorium, and to our friends of the All-China Students' Federation, for their dedicated work.
　　The International Student Union has also done a lot of work in providing learning conditions for students from colonial and newly independent countries in the form of scholarships, which are provided by our member organizations. We are very happy to say that the number of scholarships is increasing, and the International Student Union has awarded 153 scholarships in the past two years. We are very happy to announce that approximately an equal number of scholarships will be placed at our disposal next year.

    Students' Activities in Culture, Science, Travel, Sports and Journalism
　　Students' interests are diverse. These interests extend to culture and science. Students demand to acquire as much knowledge as possible in their chosen areas and in other areas, they want to know about foreign countries, and they love sports. In most countries, the development of these activities is not separated from students' other activities, let alone runs counter to them. On the contrary, they are organic supplements to those activities. Students' work to defend and develop national culture is part of their struggle against colonialism and for national independence. The increased interest of students in the latest achievements of science, and the demand to incorporate these achievements into the curriculum, is part of the students' efforts to reform the entire education system. We can happily point out that the exchange of student delegations, cultural song and dance troupes, sports teams, as well as the organization of various festivals, seminars and study trips have been a direct contribution of students to strengthening mutual understanding between countries, thereby easing international tensions.
　　One prominent example is the great success of the Sixth World Youth and Student Festival held in Moscow in the summer of 1957, which made a valuable contribution to expanding international cooperation. When evaluating the achievements of the festival, the Executive Committee of the International Student Union has every reason to express its sincere gratitude to the Soviet youth and students for their excellent work in preparing and organizing the festival, and for their friendship and hospitality to foreign guests.
　　The International Student Union has paid close attention to carrying out academic activities in the past two years. In addition to publishing regular academic publications, it has also organized or sponsored a series of academic activities.
　　The International Student Union helps to exchange delegations, organize study trips and develop individual and collective student travel within its possible scope. These activities help to broaden students' horizons and help countries understand and appreciate each other's cultures.
　　The International Student Union attaches great importance to the cooperation of student newspapers, the International Student Union knows the important role of this cooperation in national student movements and the contribution it can make to strengthening student friendship between countries. We must also commend the work of "World University News". This work helps to strengthen the unity and friendship of students from all over the world. It is a powerful tool for publicizing the International Student Union's policies and activities, and it is a reflection of the entire student movement.

    International Student Cooperation and Unity
　　Due to the increase in the activities of various student organizations to safeguard student interests in the recent period, especially due to students' participation in avoiding atomic war, anti-colonialism, striving for national independence, improving living and learning conditions, and achieving unity on these issues at the national level, international student cooperation has naturally increased. But it is not an end in itself, nor is it the exclusive property of student leaders or experts, but a means to better meet the needs of students.
　　The content of cooperation and unity must be the common main goals that students hope to achieve, that is, maintaining peace, national independence, democratization of higher education, improving learning conditions, expanding culture, science, sports, material support and other aspects of activities.
　　In the past two years, many forms of cooperation have emerged. The first form of cooperation is international joint action and support action. The second method of obtaining student cooperation is through bilateral cooperation between student organizations (including those affiliated with different international organizations). The third method of expanding student cooperation is for national student organizations to directly organize various student activities and absorb all student organizations to participate, regardless of which international student group they belong to. The fourth method of student cooperation is to conduct student cooperation in the same region. We sincerely welcome the positive achievements and unity of the Second Latin American Student Congress, just as we welcome the Asian and African Student Conference. The Asian and African Student Conference and the two Latin American Student Congresses have made huge contributions to the growth, unity and international cooperation of students on these three important continents. The fifth form of cooperation is cooperation between international student organizations. The main issue here is the relationship between the International Student Union and the "Secretariat of National Unions of Students", because most of the world's student organizations participate in these two groups separately. The "Secretariat of National Unions of Students" attempts to portray itself as the only platform for international student cooperation and refuses to cooperate with the International Student Union in any way. This attitude is not only unrealistic, but will also deepen the division of the international student movement. You will not be able to find in any resolution and publication of the "Secretariat of National Unions of Students" and the "International Student Conference" it convenes about the stance taken by students participating in the effort to defend peace and the struggle against colonialism, especially important is also the fact that many "International Student Conference" member organizations criticized is that the "Secretariat of National Unions of Students" is almost entirely financially dependent on sources other than students. We must also condemn the new attempt by the "Secretariat of National Unions of Students" to declare its willingness to cooperate with the International Student Union's member organizations but not with the International Student Union, thereby placing the International Student Union's member organizations in opposition to the International Student Union and its elected bodies.
　　All these reasons make us regret to point out that the 7th "International Student Conference" and the activities of the "Secretariat of National Unions of Students" have not contributed to improving the general trend of the international student movement atmosphere. It ignored the desire of many unions affiliated with it to expand cooperation.
　　In the spirit of its cooperation policy, the International Student Union has consistently strived to improve its relationship and cooperation with other international student organizations. We believe that the preparation and organization of the 7th World Youth and Student Festival will provide a wide range of cooperation with these organizations. The question of how students can work to defend peace may become a particularly beneficial question for cooperation between international student organizations, so we are prepared to conduct joint discussions with these organizations in the near future.
　　After reviewing the development of the international student movement in the past two years, we feel more deeply that this period is indeed full of major events and valuable experiences. We believe that the developments in the past two years fully prove that the basic principles stipulated in the charter of the International Student Union and the policies formulated by the previous congress are correct. The actual development of the student movement also proves this. All struggles to defend peace, oppose colonialism, strive for educational democratization, strive to improve students' living and learning conditions, defend students' democratic rights, and develop students' cultural and sports activities are included in the International Student Union's policies and principles. They are in line with the fundamental interests of all students and are student issues of such a nature that around these issues, students and student organizations should and can further strengthen their cooperation and unity.
　　We know that there are many difficulties on our way forward. There are forces inside and outside the student movement that are trying to hinder our progress. But we are deeply convinced that as long as we adhere to the principle of serving the true interests of students, no one and no force can stop us from moving forward. Let us pool our experiences, plans and energy to work for the development of education, culture and the bright future of the young generation!

　　国际学生运动的发展和国际学生联合会及各学生组织
    对保卫学生利益、促进国际学生合作的贡献
    ——国际学生联合会执行委员会向第五届代表大会的报告（摘要）
    在我们的报告中，我们将讨论国际学生运动的主要经验和国际学联的工作问题。
    国际学联一向认为，虽然学生有自己的特殊问题，但是（学生同时又是整个社会的不可分割的部分），他们与整个社会在许多利益和义务上是联系起来的。
    我们为生活在发生这样具有历史意义的事件的时代里而骄傲。我们有理由为许多国家学生对于人类近年来的成就所作出的积极贡献而感到骄傲。我们相信，将来某一天写我们时代历史的历史学家们，将不会忽略学生和他们人民一道，共同为避免核子战争危险、把祖国从殖民统治下解放出来而进行的努力中所起的重大作用。
    我们向在保卫学生和人民的利益的斗争中贡献出自己生命的同学们表示崇高的敬意，我们热情地向因为进行争取自由、和平和独立的斗争而被关禁被迫害的同学们致敬。
    学生在维护和平事业中的作用
    今天许多国家的军费开支已达天文数字，而教育、文化和科学的经费却仍然是远远不能令人满意。例如，法国在阿尔及利亚战争中十二天内所花的钱，就足够十万个法国学生一年的学习费用。去年，德意志联邦共和国花了五千万马克发展新式坦克车，花了六千万马克来建立航空研究院，而西德学联提出的1957—58学年教育经费应为一亿二千万马克的建议，政府仅拨出了三千万马克（其中一千八百万马克仅仅是贷款而已）。由此可见，强加在各国人民头上的军费负担是多么繁重，如果能达成裁军协议，如果国际紧张局势得到缓和，那将会给文教科学事业带来多大的好处。
    最近，和平与战争的问题是如此之尖锐，以致使学生认识到它已经超出仅仅从改善物质条件这一点出发的论点之外。具有巨大毁灭威力的原子弹和氢弹的存在本身及其不断发展，就危及我们这一代整个学习问题和前途问题。学生在学习过程中吸收了人类历代积累的知识，以便毕业后，就能建造房子，建筑水坝，医治病人，发掘地球更多的财富，教育儿童，从事艺术创造——一句话，要把知识用来为人类服务。谁能甘心让这些计划被那些本来可以为人类幸福繁荣生活开辟无限广阔道路的发明、发现所破坏呢？这是我们时代整个人类、特别是青年和知识分子面临的戏剧性的问题之一。没有人能逃脱这个问题，而永远躲藏在超政治或纯科学的幽谷里。
    人们认识到，用他们的决议和坚决的行动，他们是可以排除这种威胁的，他们因此而开展了制止可能引起灾难性的原子战争的危险竞赛的广泛群众运动。毫无疑问，大部分学生是反对原子战争的。有些学生领袖相信：和平问题太政治化，只能扩大学运的裂痕。我们认为，而且事实证明：不一定如此，也不会如此。学生的联合行动是可以做到的，如果我们首先把一切努力集中在各国具有不同思想见解的学生的共同要求上，这些要求就是：立即禁止核试验并完全禁止核武器。为达到这一目的而进行的努力，把许多采取联合行动而受到广大学生支持的学生组织团结起来了。例如，在日本，人民尖锐地感觉到原子弹和氢弹在广岛、长崎和比基尼岛的严重后果，因而争取和平的斗争是学生运动最突出的特点。仰光大学学生会，在其向大国提出的呼吁书中，表达了所有缅甸学生要求立即停止试验和禁止核武器的情绪。巴西全国学联，强烈反对巴西的南都·诺郎哈岛出租给美国政府作为导弹基地。波、捷、民主德国的学生代表最近的声明尤为重要，因为它们支持在中欧建立无原子区的建议。在西德，代表着五万学生的学生组织表示反对用核武器装备“国防军”，全国各地学生组织了示威和集会，阻止这一决定的执行。在英国，许多大学举行了投票，结果说明大部分学生反对继续试验核武器。5月，在伯明翰举行了一次全国各大学和平会议，这次会议通过决议，对英国政府拒绝停止氢弹试验表示遗憾。这几个例子已经说明：禁止核武器试验和根本禁止这些大规模破坏性的武器的运动，正以日益积极和普遍的形式出现，它能成为最广泛地团结各种不同倾向的学生组织的中心点。
    愈来愈多的学生要求达成部分或全部裁军的国际协议，以便最后地废除军事条约。第二届拉丁美洲学生代表大会表示拉丁美洲学生反对建立军事条约和军事基地的政策，反对建立南大西洋防御条约的企图。亚、非、拉丁美洲各国的许多学生组织也反对建立军事条约，反对军备竞赛。伊拉克学生，在伊拉克学生总会的领导下，坚持不渝地开展反对巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义的斗争。1957年，摩洛哥全国学联代表大会表达了摩洛哥学生对于取消外国军事基地，从摩洛哥撤出外国军队的要求。同样，突尼斯学生也支持政府关于撤出法国军队的要求。埃及学生当祖国遭到侵略的时候，就拿起武器，保卫祖国。大家也一定知道，阿拉伯及其他许多国家的学生当他们站起来反对帝国主义压力、面临被侵略危险的时候，如何坚决地和叙利亚同学站在一起。朝鲜、越南和德国的学生，他们都要求祖国和平统一，这些国家的继续分裂，可能导致严重的国际冲突。
    我们也赞许印度、缅甸、中国等许多国家的学生对和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的支持。
    国际学联一贯地引导学生注意保卫和平的问题。国际学联在今后工作中应该做到如下各点：
    一、支持有助于加强和平运动，导致停止核武器试验和根本禁止核武器的一切建议（不管它们来自什么方面），并为此目的，与所有为同样宗旨而奋斗的其他组织进行合作。
    二、同时支持学生组织争取和平的其他各种形式的活动，特别是要求取消军事条约、军事基地，撤出一切外国军队，争取全面或部分裁军，要求增加教育经费，减少军事费用，要求各国人民和学生合作等方面的努力。
    三、作进一步努力，使尽可能多的学生和学生组织参加这一共同工作，并为促进国内和国际的广泛团结服务。
    四、宣传学生争取和平的活动事例，经常报道学生在这一方面的努力及共同行动。
    五、鼓励学生学习和研究如何和平利用原子能以及其他一切先进的科学成就，为此，应组织各种习明纳尔宣传其活动情况等。
    六、促进各国学生的相互接触和了解，宣传和平共处的原则和互相尊重的概念。
    七、建议将来把国际学生周（11月10日至17日）当作国际学生和平友谊周来纪念。
    我们相信，目前是存在着建立和平并为这一事业而取得广泛学生团结的现实可能性的。国际学联号召一切全国性和国际性的学生组织，不管任何可能把它们分离的因素，为完成这一历史任务而进行合作。
    学生反殖民主义、争取民族独立的活动
    把学生反殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争说成是过去两年来学生运动的最显著特点之一，这绝不是过分的说法。这一斗争不是殖民地学生在孤立地进行着，因为他们受到全世界大部分学生的声援和支持。
    是什么原因促使学生进行这个不屈不挠的斗争呢？首先，由于处在殖民统治下，没有最基本的人权，他们因此坚决和人民一道，进行争取民族独立的总的斗争。其次，殖民地学生除了许多国家学生遇到的困难以外，他们还遇到一些特殊的障碍：他们不能用祖国语言学习，课程内容一般都是宗主国的道道地地的抄本，完全不适应他们人民的需要，他们不能选择对发展本国经济很重要的科目，系科的数目——如果在殖民地国家里存在的话——也不足以使所有的有才能的青年有机会进行学习，并受到为满足国家需要所必需的专门训练。
    殖民地学生日益觉悟到：为了为发展教育和民族文化铺平道路，他们必须首先冲破殖民主义枷锁的束缚，把国家的命运掌握在自己的手里。因为学生从切身的经验知道殖民主义的恶果。他们通过学习知道，这种情况是可以改变的。正因为如此，各国人民的要求在各国学生运动中得到了表达，学生运动一向是处在反殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争的最前列的。
    我们可以举出不久前的许多例子。在阿尔及利亚学联领导下的阿尔及利亚学生，用他们的坚毅、勇敢和忠诚的精神，和人民一道，进行了争取经过残酷考验的祖国的民族独立的斗争，赢得了国际上巨大的钦佩和同情。法属黑非洲学生在法属黑非洲学联旗帜下坚持的斗争。在它的第八届代表大会上，法属黑非洲学联勇敢地揭露了一切用各种新名目的外衣，如“根本法”或“欧非联合”等把殖民主义掩盖起来的企图，并强调获得自由和非洲进步与团结及其与其他各国的合作的唯一途径就是进行争取民族独立的斗争。在塞浦路斯，学生被逮捕，被严刑拷讯，其中许多人已经在争取塞浦路斯自决权的长期而带决定性的斗争中献出了自己的生命，这一斗争受到了希腊及其他许多国家学生的充分支持。
    殖民地学生组织同时也进行反对殖民主义在文教方面的各种后果的斗争。它们首先反对不适合的教学内容，这些教学内容不符合人民的历史，歪曲历史的事实，抹杀本国人民过去的历史，把殖民统治者说成是人道主义者和文明的施舍者。给他们头脑中的印象是：他们的国家没有文化，他们是野蛮落后的，在教育设施中，教学通过宗主国的语言来进行，而本国语言却被认为是外国语，或者受到排斥和压制。文盲是殖民主义造成的另一个结果，它企图使人民长期处于愚昧无知的状态。学生谴责一般的种族歧视和校内的种族歧视，认为它们是教育民主化和社会进步的障碍，这种谴责构成了学生保卫民主权利斗争的另一个重要部分。1957年3月国际学联执委会会议一致通过了一项专门决议，谴责南非政府的歧视行动，表示完全支持南非大、中学校学生反对种族隔离的斗争。
    在讨论学生反殖民主义问题时，应特别注意留学生问题。由于殖民主义教学制度造成的后果，成千成万想进大学的学生，不得不离开祖国。例如，在尼日利亚，在本国学习的约有五百个大学生，而在外国的却有五千多人。这些学生要用外国语学习，他们学的是与本民族文化毫无相同之处的宗主国文化，所学的知识与本国的需要不相符合。因此，这些学生碰到许多精神上和物质上的极大的困难问题。他们建立自己的组织，以便保证和本国人民的经常联系，宣传本国文化并为本国人民的事业而奋斗，保卫自己的物质上和精神上的权利和需要。国际学联是一贯无条件地承认它们并给予它们反殖民主义和争取改善生活与学习条件的斗争以一切援助的第一个甚至可以说是唯一的国际学生组织。
    在过去两年中，国际学联在对待学生反殖民主义斗争问题上，毫不犹豫地执行了会章所规定的原则和第四届学代会通过的决议。国际学联今后必须继续高举反殖民主义斗争的旗帜，不屈不挠地坚持反殖民主义态度，帮助一切殖民地学生组织，动员其他各国学生支援这个斗争。
    学生为消除殖民主义后果、参加祖国建设、争取经济独立而斗争
    学生反殖民主义斗争不仅反映在争取民族独立的斗争上，而且反映在新独立国家学生保卫国家主权，消除殖民主义后果，发展民族文教事业的努力上。发展和改革教育事业，使之适应国家的新需要，扫除文盲，扩展民族文化，改进卫生情况，克服缺乏专家，特别是科学和科学研究方面的专家的现象，发展基于本国自然资源的民族经济，彻底实现领土主权完整，取消外国军事基地，并消灭殖民主义者强加于本国政治、社会和经济方面的不利情况。
    殖民主义者用尽了许多方法来向反殖民主义的人民散布悲观空气。他们实际上是通过阻碍殖民地国家的民族独立经济发展、搜刮它们的自然资源和财富并使其人民处于极端贫困的境地的方法来制造悲观气氛的。例如，苏伊士运河公司国有化以后，他们到处宣传说埃及人民没有本领管理苏伊士运河。但是结果和帝国主义者所预言的大不相同。尽管有人表示怀疑，尽管由于殖民主义者的敌视行动而引起许多困难，埃及人民接管了苏伊士运河，而且比以前管得还要好。
    利用其光辉的历史和目前的事实鼓励新独立国家学生的爱国精神和自信心，是一项重要任务。国际学联不仅了解这种发展情况，而且一直支持学生的斗争，并通过许多方法来帮助他们。我们很骄傲地看到：由于我们对这两洲学生斗争和愿望的真诚的不断的和无条件的支持，我们获得了新独立国家更多学生组织的信任。这些国家的许多学生组织参加了国际学联，不是偶然的。
    拉丁美洲学生也有许多和殖民主义和帝国主义消极影响有关的类似问题，虽然他们的情况和亚非各国有很大的不同。他们面临着很大的问题，如经济落后，外国垄断资本家掠夺这些国家的自然资源，文盲比例很高，为外国服务的军事独裁等。因此，拉丁美洲学生在他们的第二届代表大会上宣布过：“这些问题的解决有待我们各国人民经济上的有效的调整和政治上文化上的团结，有待土地改革和把土地分配给耕种者的实现，有待掌握在外国企业手中的自然资源和其他财富的国有化和社会所有化，有待国际自由贸易的保障，学生运动将和我们国家的独立的工会组织一道进行斗争来达到这些目的，从而保持和这些组织的最紧密的国内国际的团结。”
    拉丁美洲学生活动最典型最突出的例子之一是巴西学生在巴西学联领导下为保卫自然石油资源、原子矿物和水力发电而进行的斗争。委内瑞拉“大学阵线”在伯雷兹·希门尼斯政权时期处于地下状态，在推翻独裁者的斗争中起过极其重大的作用。在巴拿马学联内的巴拿马学生非常密切注意巴拿马运河条约的问题。他们的主要要求之一是要政府修改这个条约，这一条约把巴拿马的一部分置于美国的管辖之下。在许多其他国家，特别在古巴、巴拉圭、尼加拉瓜和危地马拉，学生正在和人民一道，站在最前列，为推翻那些仰仗外国支持的、阻碍本国政治经济发展的、阻碍教育事业发展的政权而斗争。我们确信，这一大洲的学生和人民一道，将会达到目的，建设好自己的祖国，消灭一切形式的落后现象。用他们的斗争精神，他们一定能建设好自己的国家，把它们建设成为利用现代科学技术的高度发展的地区。
    学生为要求实行教育改革、保卫学生权利、改善生活与学习条件而进行的活动
    实行教育民主化，要求改善物质条件，要求民主权利，长期以来就是全世界各国学生运动的传统的基本要求之一。其中一项是：高等学校要向一切有才能的青年开门。在世界上许多国家中，高等教育仍然是富家子弟的特权，而不很富裕的、中产阶级的家庭的子女就很难上大学，至于工农子弟，虽然他们在人口中是最广泛的阶层，他们在学生中却更是只占极少数。例如，在法国的高等学校里，工人子弟只占学生总人数的3.5％，农村家庭的子女只占6％。在希腊，有学生一万八千人（人口共八百万，即每一千人中只有二点二五大学生）。这些学生不仅拿不到国家助学金，而且要付高昂的学费，结果许多学生念完中学以后，就不能升大学，那些升了大学的，也只有一半人读到毕业。
    社会主义国家采取了有趣的措施来实行高等教育民主化，这些改革的重要原则是实行统一的基本教育制度以便让所有子弟有同样的学习进程和同样的继续提高自己教育程度的机会。入学标准是学生的实际才能和学力，而不是他们家庭的财力。除了这一点，每个学生在法律上都可以享受政府助学金，学费是全免的。在民主德国，有九万全读学生正在四十七所高等学校学习，而1949年只有三万学生在十七所高等学校学习。90％的全读学生享受助学金。56％的学生是工人阶级出身。在阿尔巴尼亚，在过去旧政权下根本没有高等学校，现在已建立一所国立大学，共有六个系科，学生共三千三百人。高等教育民主化的另一重要方面是：改变学习内容和高等学校结构，使之适应社会和国家的需要。学生也要求足够的学习条件和设备，更好的住宿条件、文娱设备以及医疗照顾，他们还进一步要求解决半工半读学生面临的问题，并要求毕业后就业的充分机会。
    教育民主化的另一个不可分割的部分是：承认学生在校内校外的民主权利。因此，许多国家的学生，特别是在那些剥夺这种权利的地方，正在为实现民主权利和大学民主概念而进行斗争。对学生组织的镇压，在许多情况下是和对他们人民的进攻直接相联系的。因此，学生进行反抗对他们组织镇压手段的激烈斗争。因此争取学生民主权利的斗争，不能不和他们争取更大规模民主的斗争联系起来。
    国际学联对于正在为保卫民主权利的学生和学生组织表示支持，并组织声援运动。国际学联进一步扩大了物质支援活动的范围，除帮助了各国的自助活动外，还在过去三年中帮助了一千多名患肺病的学生病人，到它开设在北京的亚非学生疗养院去治疗。我们想借此机会向疗养院的医生及其他人员，向中华全国学联的朋友表示诚挚的感谢，感谢他们专心一致的工作。
    国际学联在以助学金形式向殖民地和新独立国家学生提供学习条件中，也做了许多工作，这些助学金是由我们的会员组织提供的。我们很高兴地说，助学金名额在增加着，两年来国际学联已发了一百五十三名助学金。我们很高兴地宣布，来年有大约相等数量的助学金将被置于我们支配之下。
    学生在文化、科学、旅行、体育和新闻等方面的活动
    学生的兴趣是多方面的。这些兴趣延及文化科学方面。学生要求在他们选择的范围内以及其他方面获得尽可能多的知识，他们要知道外国，他们热爱体育。在多数国家中，这些活动的发展不是跟学生的其他活动分隔开来的，更不是背道而驰的。相反，它们是那些活动的有机补充物。学生保卫和发展民族文化的工作是他们反对殖民主义，争取民族独立斗争的一部分。学生对科学最新成就的兴趣增加，以及要求把这些成就结合到课程里来，这是学生为改革整个教育制度而进行的努力的一个部分。我们可以高兴地指出：学生代表团、文化歌舞团、体育队的交换以及各种联欢节、习明纳尔和学习旅行的组织一直是学生对加强各国相互了解，从而对和缓国际紧张局势的直接贡献。
    一个突出的例子就是1957年夏天在莫斯科举行的第六届世界青年与学生联欢节的伟大成功，它对扩展国际合作作了有价值的贡献。国际学联执行委员会在估价联欢节的成绩的时候，完全有理由表示对苏联青年和学生的诚挚感谢，感谢他们在筹备和组织联欢节中所作的出色的工作，感谢他们对外国客人们的友谊和招待。
    国际学联在过去两年中很注意开展学科活动。除出版定期学科刊物，还组织或赞助了一系列的学科活动。
    国际学联在它可能的范围内帮助交换代表团、组织学习旅行和发展个人与集体学生旅行，这些活动有助于扩大学生的视野，有助于各国的了解和对彼此文化的赞赏。
    国际学联十分重视学生报刊的合作，国际学联知道这种合作在全国性学生运动中的重要作用以及它对加强各国学生友谊所能作出的贡献。我们也必须赞许“世界大学生新闻”的工作。这项工作有助于加强世界各国学生的团结和友谊。它是宣传国际学联的方针和活动的有力工具，也是整个学生运动的一个反映。
    国际学生合作与统一
    由于在最近这段时期以内各学生组织保卫学生利益活动的增加，特别是由于学生参加了避免原子战争、反殖民主义，争取民族独立、改善生活学习条件的斗争，并在全国范围内对这些问题上取得了团结，因而国际学生合作就自然而然地有所增长。但它本身不是一个目的，也不是学生领袖或专家的专有物，而是更好地满足学生要求的手段。
    合作和统一的内容必须是学生所期望实现的共同的主要目的，就是维护和平、民族独立、高等教育民主化、改善学习条件、扩大文化、科学、体育、物质支援等方面的活动。
    在过去两年中，出现了许多种形式的合作。第一种合作的形式是国际联合行动和支援行动。第二种取得学生合作的方法是通过学生组织（包括那些和不同国际组织有联系的学生组织在内）之间的双边合作。第三种扩大学生合作的方法是由全国学生组织直接组织各种学生活动，并吸收一切学生组织参加，不管它们属于哪一个国际学生团体。第四种学生合作的方法是进行同地区的学生合作。我们真诚地欢迎第二届拉丁美洲学代会的积极成就和团结，正如我们欢迎亚非学生会议一样。亚非学生会议和两届拉丁美洲学代会对这三个重要大陆的学生成长、团结和国际合作做出了巨大的贡献。第五种合作的形式是国际学生组织之间的合作。这里的主要问题是国际学联与“各国学联秘书处”的关系问题，因为世界大部分学生组织都分别参加这两个团体。“各国学联秘书处”企图把自己说成是国际学生合作的唯一讲台，拒绝与国际学联进行任何合作。这种态度不仅不现实，而且会加深国际学生运动分裂。你将无法在“各国学联秘书处”和它所召开的“国际学生会议”的任何决议和刊物中发现关于学生参加保卫和平的努力和反对殖民主义的斗争所采取的立场，特别重要的是也是受到许多
  “国际学生会议”会员组织批评的事实，乃是“各国学联秘书处”在财政上几乎完全依赖学生以外的来源。我们也必须谴责“各国学联秘书处”宣布愿意和国际学联会员组织而不愿和国际学联合作，从而把国际学联会员组织和国际学联以及其被选举出来的机构置于相对立的地位的新企图。
    所有这些原因，使我们遗憾地指出：第七届“国际学生会议”和“各国学联秘书处”的活动，没有对改善国际学生运动气氛的总趋势作出贡献。它忽视了与它有联系的许多学联对扩大合作的愿望。
    根据其合作政策精神，国际学联一贯为改善它与其它国际学生组织的关系和合作而努力。我们认为，第七届世界青年与学生联欢节的筹备和组织工作将提供和这些组织合作的广泛范围。学生如何为保卫和平而努力的问题，可能成为国际学生组织合作特别有益的问题，因此我们准备和这些组织在最近进行共同的商讨。
    在回顾过去两年国际学生运动的发展后，我们更深刻地感到这一时期的确充满了重大事件和宝贵的经验。我们认为，过去两年的事态发展充分证明国际学联会章中和上届代表大会制定的政策中所规定的基本原则是正确的。学生运动的实际发展也证明了这一点。一切保卫和平、反对殖民主义、争取教育民主化、争取改善学生生活和学习条件、保卫学生民主权利、发展学生文化和体育活动的斗争，都包括在国际学联的政策和原则之内。它们符合一切学生的根本利益，并且是带有这样性质的学生问题，就是环绕这些问题，学生和学生组织应当而且能够进一步加强他们的合作和统一。
    我们知道，在我们前进的道路上有着许多困难。学生运动的内部和外部都有势力企图阻碍我们前进。但是我们深信，只要我们坚持为学生的真正利益服务的原则，没有任何人和力量能阻挡我们前进。让我们汇合我们的经验、计划和精力来为发展教育、文化事业和青年一代的美好未来而努力吧！
