Time: Present
Scene: A flat board with the White House painted on it, a platform behind.

(Eisenhower and Dulles enter from opposite sides, each carrying three humanoid wooden boards on their backs.)

Eisenhower: I am the President of the United States!
Dulles: I am the U.S. Secretary of State!
Eisenhower: Eisenhower is me,
Dulles: Dulles is my name,

(They meet.)

Eisenhower: Oh, Dulles!
Dulles: Mr. President!
Eisenhower: Dulles, listen carefully, after World War II, the socialist system became a camp, seeing that half the world has turned red, we must quickly find a way to patch it up!
Dulles: Oh dear, Mr. President, it's not peaceful everywhere these days: Iraq is having a revolution, declaring independence is quite impressive, killing our friend Said, tearing the Baghdad Pact to shreds! There are rebellions everywhere, and our backyard is not peaceful either!
Eisenhower: If they gain power, we won't survive! Dulles, my Secretary of State, quickly call the names of our running dogs and let them guard their posts one by one, don't let them relax!
Dulles: Yes, yes, yes, Mr. President, no one is as smart as you!

(The two walk around the stage in circles, placing the human figures they are carrying on the stage one by one, finally forming a semi-circle.)

Eisenhower: (Places one, labeled "Adenauer") Adenauer, my old friend, you guard West Germany, don't relax, practice your troops well, and we'll attack when we find a gap!
Dulles: (Places a human figure: "Syngman Rhee") Syngman Rhee, guard Seoul, you just shout out "Northern Expedition"! No matter what happens to China and Korea, the United States will not withdraw its troops anyway.
Eisenhower: (Places a human figure: "Nobusuke Kishi") Nobusuke Kishi, just be tough, don't be afraid of your Japanese people, you are an old hand at invading China, and I have to rely on you to be the vanguard!
Dulles: (Places a human figure: "Ngo Dinh Diem") Ngo Dinh Diem, South Vietnam relies entirely on you, my friend, if you have the opportunity, just attack north, and I will take the blame for any trouble!
Eisenhower: (Places a human figure: "Chamoun") Call Chamoun, you are a real coward, you can't even be the president of Lebanon, forcing me to show my face and send troops, no matter what others say about me, I just won't withdraw the troops!
Dulles: (Places a human figure: "Chiang Kai-shek") Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Chung-cheng, Taiwan must not relax, Jinmen and Matsu are springboards, relying on them to land on the mainland! I give you guns and pay, you must take good care of your bearded soldiers!

(The two finish arranging and look around.)

Eisenhower: The arrangement is done, and the mood is relaxed, from west to east, forming a circle of encirclement, with the Soviet Union and China in it, you (pointing to the human figures) are my good friends, and I am your living ancestor!
Dulles: (Quickly pulls him from behind) Mr. President, Mr. President, keep your voice down, this sentence is not pleasant to hear, these guys are not good, don't take bald heads as light bulbs, give them a necklace to wear, hold this end in our hands, tell them to open their mouths and not dare to close them, tell them to go west and not dare to go east!
Eisenhower: Secretary of State, so clever, this method is really smart, reaching out and taking the magic treasure bag, (takes out two black bundles, with two white characters "U.S. Aid" written on them) inside are all immortal binding ropes, let's do it together, put the ropes around their necks and don't let go!

(The two take out many ropes from the bag, both ends have knots, and in the music, they put them one by one on the six human figures, then dance back to the platform with their hands and feet. They look around proudly.)

Dulles: The ends of the ropes are in our hands,
Eisenhower: The whole world listens to my orders!

(The two dance with their hands and feet, put the rope circles on their arms, legs, and necks respectively, and are extremely excited.)

Dulles: Mr. President, why are you sweating so much?
Eisenhower: I see your face is also red!

(They touch each other's foreheads with their hands.)

Dulles: This is the fire in our hearts burning,
Eisenhower: The higher the temperature, the clearer we are.

(The two look at each other and laugh, then fall asleep dizzily.)

(The lights gradually dim, the drums rumble, Hitler and Hideki Tojo come on, both with white strips on their necks.)

Hitler: The black wind howls, sending my fascist ancestors!
Tojo: You are the boss, I am the second, I am the younger brother, you are the older brother.

(The two approach the platform, Eisenhower and Dulles wake up.)

Eisenhower: (Recognizing Hitler) Oh, so familiar, it's you, old sir!
Dulles: (Shakes Tojo's hand) Brother Tojo, please listen, I am advancing along your old road. (Shakes his head and sways triumphantly.)

Hitler: (Sees the rope around Eisenhower's neck) What's that around your neck? Could it be that you are also sentenced to hanging?
Dulles: Saying that is really ignorant, the fate of the whole world is in my hands!
Hitler: Hey, in the beginning, my momentum was great, my ambition was to swallow the world, Britain and France were not my opponents, they were all defeated by me, but when I encountered the Soviet Union, it was fatal, fortunately, I committed suicide quickly, otherwise, it would be difficult to escape the rope on the gallows!
Eisenhower: That just means you didn't have the ability, blindly stirring things up yourself, look at me, I don't move at all, the world is in my hands!

(Moves his hands, feet, and neck, the ropes move in disorder.)

Tojo: Hey, hey, hey, don't go crazy, I was even fiercer than you in the beginning, I was the leader in Asia, creating a circle called "Co-Prosperity," I was only majestic for a few years, and I lost my life in prison, China and the Soviet Union are not easy to mess with, you must not turn a deaf ear to them!
Eisenhower: This is really: once bitten by a snake, ten years afraid of well ropes, look at who is doing well today, the power of the United States is immense, there are no opponents under the heavens, my lackeys are all over the West!
Hitler: Be careful, Mr. President, don't let your tongue catch a cold, you were defeated on the Korean battlefield, how can you have the face to call yourself a hero!
Tojo: These years are not the previous years, the Soviet satellite has gone into space, and there are Khrushchev and Mao Zedong, they represent a billion people, strong generals have no weak soldiers, ten years ago I was able to get a whole corpse, I think you will probably be separated east and west!

(Eisenhower jumps up and down in a rage.)

Eisenhower: Get out, get out, two demons, you two are unlucky stars, you two get out of here, wait for me to celebrate!
Hitler: The bragging is not small, even fiercer than I was at the beginning, waiting for you on the road to the Yellow Springs, you'll meet in two days!
Tojo: Better not to talk nonsense with him anymore, let them mess around!

(Sound of cannons booming.)

(Hitler and Tojo slip down, the sound of cannons gets louder, Eisenhower and Dulles are shocked.)

Eisenhower: Secretary of State, hurry up and find out, what is shaking the earth? Is it Chiang's son who sent troops to attack the mainland?
Dulles: (Runs down and up again in a hurry) Report, Mr. President, it's not peaceful, Chiang's son is too incompetent, he went to harass Chinese territory, provoking the Chinese people to get angry, determined to punish him, bombing Jinmen, Chiang Kai-shek's warship sank to the bottom, and another one was full of holes!
Eisenhower: Don't be afraid, don't be surprised, we have the Seventh Fleet in the Far East, we will escort military supplies and protect Jinmen from being bombed.

A huge voice: Warships can only fire salutes, or else they can only be used as targets for rockets!
Eisenhower: Who is this? So impulsive?
Dulles: This is what Khrushchev said, from the Kremlin!
Eisenhower: (Tightens the ropes) Don't think warships are useless, the world's noose is in my hands, as long as I move a little, no one can survive!

(Before he finishes speaking, a backdrop rises from behind the platform, with a huge red fist painted on it. Following this, another huge voice rises):

"...Americans are making this noose and putting it around their own necks, and handing the other end of the noose to the Chinese people, the people of Arab countries, and all the people of the world who love peace and oppose aggression."
Dulles: Oh dear, my President, the speaker is Mao Zedong!

(Eisenhower and Dulles try hard to take off the ropes, but it's too late. A PLA soldier comes on, holding the ropes tightly in his hands, kicking down Chiang Kai-shek's figure, followed by white, brown, and black people holding the ropes and kicking down the other figures one after another, Eisenhower and Dulles are all strangled by the noose and cannot move.)

Everyone sings together: The U.S. imperialists vainly try to rule the world,
	The noose is all in our hands,
	The people of the world act together,
	Don't let the U.S. imperialists show off,
	Hang the U.S. imperialist wolves,
	Keep the world forever peaceful, forever peaceful!

    着三个人形木板。）艾：我是美国大总统！杜：我是美国国务卿！艾：艾森豪威尔就是我，杜：杜勒斯就是我的名，
    （二人相见。）艾：哟，杜勒斯！杜：大总统！艾：杜勒斯，听分明，二次世界大战后，社会主义成了阵营，眼看着天下红了一半，得赶紧想法打补钉！杜：哎呀呀，大总统，如今到处不太平：伊拉克闹革命，宣布独立挺威风，打死咱朋友赛义德，巴格达条约撕了个大窟窿！到处都有人造反，咱们家的后院也不安生！艾：他们要得势，咱都活不成！杜勒斯，我的国务卿，赶紧把咱们的走狗点点名，让他们一个一个守好岗位别放松！杜：行，行，行，大总统，天下就属您聪明！（两人分走圆场，逐个将所背人形摆在台上，最后成一半圆状。）艾：（摆下一个，上书“阿登纳”）阿登纳，我的老兄，你守住西德别放松，好好地把兵练，抓碴咱们就进攻！杜：（摆下一人形：“李承晚”）李承晚，守汉城，你只管放声大喊叫“北征”！不管中朝怎么样，反正我美国不撤兵。艾：（摆一人形：“岸信介”）岸信介，你尽管硬，千万别怕你日本老百姓，侵略中国你是老手，我还得靠你当先锋！杜：（摆一人形：“吴庭艳”）吴庭艳，南越全靠你老兄，有机会你就往北打，打出祸来我担承！艾：（摆一人形：“夏蒙”）叫夏蒙，你真狗熊，黎巴嫩的总统也当不成，害得我抛头露面出了兵，不管别人说我啥，反正我就是不撤兵！杜：（摆一人形：“蒋介石”）蒋介石，蒋中正，台湾可千万别放松，金门马祖是跳板，靠着它把大陆登！我给你枪给你饷，你可好好地养着你的胡子兵！（二人布置完，环顾。）艾：安排完了把气松，从西一直拉到东，形成一道包围圈，苏联中国在其中，你们（指众人形）是我的好朋友，我是你们的活祖宗！杜：（赶紧从后边扯他一把）总统总统你轻点声，这句话可不受听，这帮家伙没好货，别拿着秃头当电灯，给他们个项链带，这头攥在咱手中，叫他张嘴不敢闭，叫他往西不敢东！艾：国务卿，好机灵，这个办法真聪明，伸手拿过了法宝囊，（拿出两个黑包袱，上写着两个白字“美援”）里边都是捆仙绳，咱们一齐来下手，套住他们的脖子别放松！
    （两人从包中取出许多绳子，两头都有结，在音乐声中，一个个地套在六个人形上，然后手舞足蹈地跳回平台上。得意四顾。）杜：绳头都在咱的手，艾：全世界都听我命令！（二人手舞足蹈，将绳圈分别套在臂上腿上，脖子上，兴奋之至。）杜：总统你怎么直出汗？艾：我看你也脸发红！
    （互相用手摸额。）杜：这是咱心头火正盛，艾：温度越高越清醒。
    （两人相视而笑，迷迷糊糊地睡了。）
    （灯渐暗，鼓声隆隆，希特勒和东条英机上，他们项上都带着白纸条。）希：忽楞楞刮黑风，送来我法西斯的老祖宗！东：你是老大我老二，我是老弟你老兄。
    （两人走近平台，艾杜醒）艾：（辨视希）呀，好眼熟，原来是你老先生！杜：（握东条手）东条兄，你请听，我正按着你的老路往前冲。（摇头晃脑得意之至。）希：（看艾脖子上套着绳扣）脖子上边套的啥？莫非你也判绞刑。杜：说这话，真欠通，全世界命运都在我手中！希：哎，当初我的气势大，吞并世界志量宏，英法不是我对手，全都败在我手中，可碰到苏联要了命，幸亏我自杀的快，要不然难逃绞架上边绳！艾：那就算你没能耐，自己出面瞎折腾，看我根本不挪窝，天下都在我手中！
    （动动手脚、脖子，各处绳索乱动。）东：哎哎哎，你别发疯，当初我比你还凶，亚洲我算是盟主，弄了个圈圈叫“共荣”，统共威风了没几年，一命丧在监狱中，中苏全都不好惹，你可别当耳边风！艾：这真是：一朝被蛇咬，十年怕井绳，你看看今天是谁行，美国的力量大无穷，普天之下没对手，我的喽罗遍西东！希：小心点，大总统，别让舌头受了风，朝鲜战场你打败，亏你有脸充英雄！东：这两年不是前两年，苏联的卫星上了天空，还有赫鲁晓夫毛泽东，他俩代表人民十亿整，强将手下无弱兵，十年前我能落个整尸首，我看你八成身首各西东！
    （艾暴跳如雷）艾：滚滚滚，两妖精，你俩是一对丧门星，你们给我一边去，好好等着给我来庆功！希：牛皮吹的可不小，比我当初还要凶，黄泉路上等着你，过不上两天准相逢！东：趁早别跟他再废话，让他俩去瞎折腾！（炮声隆隆）
    （希、东溜下，炮声越响，艾杜惊。）艾：国务卿，快打听，是什么震的天地动？是不是蒋家干儿出了兵，向着大陆去进攻？杜：（急跑下又跑上）报总统不太平，蒋家干儿太无能，前去骚扰中国地，惹得中国人民把气生，决心下手来惩凶，冲着金门把炮轰，蒋介石的军舰沉了底，另一艘打的净是大窟窿！艾：别害怕，别吃惊，我们有第七舰队在远东，军火物资咱护送，保住金门别被轰。一个巨大的声音：军舰只能放放礼炮，再不然就只能当做火箭打靶的目标！艾：这是谁？这么冲？杜：这是赫鲁晓夫说的话，来自克里姆林宫！艾：（把绳索都拉紧）别看军舰不中用，世界的绞索掌在我手中，只要我稍动一动，无论是谁也活不成！（话犹未了，从平台后边，升起一块景片，上边画着一个红色的巨大拳头，随着，另一个巨大的声音起来）：
    “……美国人制造这种绞索并把它套在自己的颈子上，而把绞索的另一端交给了中国人民、阿拉伯各国人民和全世界一切爱和平反侵略的人民。”杜：哎呀呀，我的总统，说这话的是毛泽东！（艾杜努力想摘绳套，但是晚了，一个解放军上，手中紧紧地握着绳索一脚踢倒蒋介石的人形，紧接着，白、棕、黑三种人都握着绳索上，纷纷地将其他人形踢倒，艾、杜全被绞索套住，不能动弹。） 众齐歌：美帝妄想统治全世界，
         绞索全交在了我们手中，
         全世界人民齐行动，
         不让美帝逞威风，
         绞死美帝野心狼，
         保持世界永和平，永和平！
