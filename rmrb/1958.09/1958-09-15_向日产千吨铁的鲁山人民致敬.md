    Saluting the People of Lushan for Producing a Thousand Tons of Iron Daily

    The people of Lushan County, Henan Province, achieved a new record of producing a thousand tons of iron daily at the end of August. Now they are organizing a new upsurge, striving to achieve a new goal of producing more than two thousand tons of iron daily in the near future. This is great news on the steel front, a satellite of large-scale bumper harvests from native blast furnaces. It has the same important significance as the large-scale bumper harvests on the agricultural front, and in the current situation, it has even greater significance. There are hundreds of counties with iron ore resources in the country. If each county achieves large-scale bumper harvests like Lushan, then we can obtain tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tons of iron daily from native blast furnaces, which can fundamentally reverse the situation where the iron output of small blast furnaces is still not good. In this way, the basic guarantee for producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year will be in place.

    At present, the output of native blast furnaces in many counties is still very low. Of course, there are indeed many difficulties in smelting iron in native blast furnaces at present, but the question is still how to deal with these difficulties. The current situation is very clear: no matter how many difficulties there are, we must obtain 10.7 million tons of steel this year. To make steel, we must first have iron, and iron is currently the key. This is a tough battle, and we must break through this fortress. The experience of Lushan tells us that the fortress can be broken through. They used three "magic weapons" to open the fortress. First, they launched a large-scale debate on running the steel industry throughout the county, refuting the pessimistic view that "not to mention producing a thousand tons of iron daily, even breaking a thousand tons of stones is not easy," and also refuting the low-output view that "native blast furnaces cannot leap forward." This cleared away ideological obstacles for producing a thousand tons of iron daily. Second, they organized a mass upsurge of building furnaces, repairing roads, mining, transporting materials, making cans, and smelting, mobilizing nearly 40,000 people and more than 9,000 vehicles to prepare a series of material conditions for producing a thousand tons of iron daily. Third, they launched a technical innovation movement centered on reforming transportation tools, improving furnace shapes, and improving operating methods, which not only guaranteed normal iron output but also greatly increased the output of native blast furnaces.

    From this, it seems that "everything depends on human effort" is still a true statement. With the same difficulties, whoever has greater determination can win.

    The people of Lushan County, in order to realize the call of the Party Central Committee to double steel production this year, have gone all out, striving for the best, and have set a good example. We salute the people of Lushan here, hoping that you will make further progress and successfully realize the plan of producing two thousand tons of iron daily. At the same time, we also hope that all counties with iron-making tasks will overcome difficulties in every possible way like Lushan County to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the iron-making plan in September, laying the foundation for a greater leap forward in October.

### 向日产千吨铁的鲁山人民致敬

    向日产千吨铁的鲁山人民致敬
    河南鲁山县在8月末达到日产千吨铁的新纪录，现在正在组织新的高潮，力争在近日内达到日产铁两千吨以上的新目标，这是钢铁战线上的一大喜讯，是土高炉大面积丰收的卫星。它和农业战线上的大面积丰收有同等重要的意义，而在目前来说，有更重要的意义，全国有几百个有铁矿资源的县，如果每个县都像鲁山那样大面积丰收，那末，我们每天就可从土高炉拿到十几万到几十万吨铁，就可以根本扭转小高炉出铁情况仍然不好的局面。这样，今年产钢一千零七十万吨就有了基本保证。
    现在还有许多县土高炉的产量仍然很低。当然，土高炉炼铁目前确实存在不少困难，但问题仍然是怎样对待困难。现在情况很清楚，不论有多少困难，今年都必须拿到一千零七十万吨钢。炼钢必须先有铁，铁是目前的关键。这是一场硬仗，我们必须攻破这个堡垒。鲁山的经验告诉我们，堡垒是可以攻破的。他们用了三个“法宝”，就把堡垒打开了，一是在全县范围内展开了一个办钢铁工业的大辩论，驳倒了“不用说日产千吨铁，就是打千吨石头也不容易”的悲观论，也驳倒了“土高炉不能大跃进”的低产论。为日产千吨铁扫除了思想障碍。二是组织了一个群众性的建炉、修路、采矿、运料、制罐、冶炼的高潮，动员了近四万人和九千多辆车，为日产千吨铁准备了一系列的物质条件。三是掀起了一个以改革运输工具、改进炉形、改进操作方法为中心的技术革新运动，不仅保证了正常出铁，而且把土高炉的产量大大提高了。
    由此看来，事在人为，仍然是个真理。同样的困难，谁的决心大，谁就可以操胜券。
    鲁山县人民为了实现党中央提出的今年钢产翻一番的号召，鼓足干劲，力争上游，作出了良好的榜样。我们在这里向鲁山人民致敬，希望你们百尺竿头，更进一步，胜利实现日产铁两千吨的计划。同时我们也希望所有有炼铁任务的县，都像鲁山县一样千方百计克服困难，保证完成和超额完成9月份的炼铁计划，为在十月份更大的跃进打下基础。
