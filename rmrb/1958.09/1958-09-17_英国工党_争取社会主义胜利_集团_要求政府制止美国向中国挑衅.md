Xinhua News Agency, London, September 15th: The British Labour Party's "Victory for Socialism" group held a public meeting here tonight and passed an emergency appeal demanding that the British government take immediate action to stop the trend towards war with China, and demanding that China be admitted to the United Nations.

The meeting also passed a resolution demanding that the Labour Party leaders immediately launch a nationwide movement to oppose war with China, and demanding that Parliament reconvene immediately.

Chairman Swingler announced at the meeting that Gaitskell, on behalf of the Labour Party's "Shadow Cabinet," had written an urgent letter to British Prime Minister Macmillan, condemning US military intervention and demanding that the government persuade the United States not to go to war with China.

Swingler said: "We welcome the action of sending this letter. At the same time, we still believe that it is necessary to go further than this. We should demand that the Prime Minister take immediate and positive action to allow the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations Organization."

Lord Stansgate said at the meeting: "To say that China is the aggressor invading Jinmen is an absurd distortion of right and wrong." He added: "The fact is: the Chiang Kai-shek troops, entirely employed, protected, and instigated by foreigners, are occupying Jinmen and infringing upon the Chinese mainland."

He believes that Chiang Kai-shek's troops should withdraw from Jinmen.

Labour MP John Baird refuted the blatant lie of the United States that China is the aggressor. He said: "If there is any aggression on the Chinese sea, then this aggression does not come from China. It comes from the United States of America."

He asked: "What right does the US Seventh Fleet have to conduct exercises in the Taiwan Strait?"

He pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek, with US support, is strengthening the position of Jinmen and Mazu in order to use these islands as springboards for harassing the mainland. He also said that if the United States did not interfere in the Chinese sea, the dispute over Taiwan would have been resolved long ago. Taiwan is Chinese territory and must be resolved by the Chinese themselves.

Tom Agar of the British Co-operative Movement described the dangerous situation, saying: "We are sitting on a pile of dynamite." He said that the US protection of Chiang Kai-shek is the greatest threat to world peace. He said that the British people are unwilling to shed a drop of blood to support the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek.

Many of those attending the meeting expressed strong opposition to US war provocations in the Far East and on Chinese territory, demanding immediate and resolute action to stop the danger of war.

Xinhua News Agency, London, September 15th: The Redditch branch of the Amalgamated Engineering Union has passed a resolution fiercely opposing the government's support for US provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait. Miners at the South Wales Edward's coal mine also passed a resolution warning the government that they would not participate in a war of aggression for Taiwan and other islands belonging to the mainland.

    英国工党“争取社会主义胜利”集团
    要求政府制止美国向中国挑衅
    新华社伦敦15日电　英国工党“争取社会主义胜利”集团今天晚上在这里召开的公开集会通过了一项紧急呼吁，要求英国政府立即采取行动制止同中国发生战争的趋势，并且要求让中国进入联合国。
    这次集会还通过了一项决议，要求工党领导人立即发动一个全国性的运动来反对同中国发生战争，并且要求议会立即复会。
    主席斯文格勒在会上宣布，盖茨克尔代表工党“影子内阁”写了一封紧急信件给英国首相麦克米伦，谴责美国的军事干涉，并且要求政府劝说美国不要同中国发生战争。
    斯文格勒说：“我们欢迎发出这封信的行动。同时，我们仍然认为，必须比这更进一步。我们应当要求首相立即采取积极行动让中华人民共和国进入联合国组织。”
    斯坦斯盖特勋爵在会上说：“说中国是进犯金门的侵略者，这是颠倒是非的荒谬说法。”他又说：“事实是：完全由外国人雇用、保护和唆使的蒋介石军队占领着金门和侵犯中国大陆。”
    他认为，蒋介石军队应当撤出金门。
    工党议员约翰·贝尔德驳斥了美国说中国是侵略者这个漫天大谎。他说：“如果说中国海面有任何侵略，那么，这种侵略并不是来自中国。它来自美利坚合众国。”
    他问道：“美国第七舰队有什么权利在台湾海峡演习？”
    他指出，蒋介石在美国支持下加强金门和马祖的地位，是要把这些岛屿作为滋扰大陆时可能使用的跳板。他又说，如果美国不在中国海面进行干涉，关于台湾的争执早就解决了。台湾是中国的领土，必须由中国人自己来解决。
    英国合作运动的托姆·艾加描述危险的局势说：“我们是坐在一堆炸药上。”他说，美国保护蒋介石是对世界和平的最大威胁。他说，英国人民不愿为支持反动的蒋介石而流一滴血。
    参加集会的许多人都表示强烈反对美国在远东和在中国领土上的战争挑衅，要求立即采取坚决行动来制止战争危险。
    据新华社伦敦15日电　英国混合机械工业工会雷迪契分会通过决议，猛烈反对政府支持美国在台湾海峡的挑衅行动。南威尔士德华斯煤矿的矿工也通过决议，警告政府说，他们将不参加为台湾和属于大陆的其他岛屿而进行的侵略战争。
