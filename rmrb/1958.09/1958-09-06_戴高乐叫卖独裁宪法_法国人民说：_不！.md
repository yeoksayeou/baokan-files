Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from Paris: French Prime Minister de Gaulle, who came to power relying on military rebellion, delivered a speech yesterday in the heavily guarded "Republic Square" in Paris, peddling his draft dictatorial "constitution." Around the "Republic Square," many French people angrily shouted: "Say 'No' to de Gaulle!" "Don't let fascism succeed!"

Several hours before de Gaulle was scheduled to deliver his speech, a large number of police and plainclothes agents had already filled the "Republic Square" with sentry posts; only those with invitations and special passes were allowed to enter. Fire brigades were also deployed to assist the police. Police helicopters hovered low in the sky above the square. Detectives were stationed on the balconies and windows of buildings around the square. Roads leading to the square were guarded by "Republican Security Forces" wearing steel helmets. At the same time, the French people, opposing fascist dictatorship, responded to the call of the French Communist Party, the "Anti-Fascist Committee," and other democratic organizations. They marched in orderly ranks towards the "Republic Square," carrying flags and chanting slogans.

Under such circumstances, de Gaulle delivered a speech on the platform in the square, asking the French people to support his draft "constitution" designed to bury the French republican democratic system in the "referendum" held on September 28. This "constitution" allows de Gaulle to monopolize power, provides him with convenient excuses to persecute the French Communist Party and all democratic forces, and makes the parliament a mere decoration of his dictatorial regime.

In his speech, de Gaulle exhausted the means of intimidation and deception. He said that if his draft "constitution" is adopted, so that the country obtains "sufficient strength and prestige," the French nation will "prosper again"; otherwise, the French nation will "perish." He did not shy away from the fact that after his "constitution" is passed, he, as the president, will become the so-called "national arbiter"; his unpopular government will also rule for a long time.

At the same time, de Gaulle also said that his "constitution" does not infringe upon any rights of the people, nor does it violate any public freedom.

However, while he was delivering his speech, special police forces specializing in suppressing people's movements, assisted by personnel from the fascist paratrooper units, attacked the people outside the square demanding freedom and singing the national anthem "La Marseillaise" with tear gas, horses, and batons, resulting in many injuries. Many people were also arrested.

The people who were dispersed by the police did not succumb. They regrouped in the streets and shouted: "Don't let fascism succeed!"

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Paris: Responding to the call of the French Communist Party, thousands of Parisian women held a conference yesterday at the Alhambra Hall in Paris. French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez delivered a speech at the meeting on why French women should vote against in the referendum.

Thorez said that in the past three months, a system of personal autocracy has been established in France. This dictatorial system hopes to be approved by the people, so as to become a permanent system.

Thorez pointed out that if de Gaulle's constitution is passed, it will lead to a fascist system, and fascism means the abolition of all women's rights, turning them into slaves.

Thorez finally pointed out to the women participating in the meeting that their task is to vote against in the referendum and make the masses of women vote against together.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Paris: As the date of the "referendum" approaches, the movement of people in various parts of France against de Gaulle's draft "constitution" is also rising.

The "Committee for the Defense of the Republic" of Meurthe-et-Moselle, composed of representatives from forty-five organizations, called on the people to vote against on September 28.

The Brest Republican Action Committee published a booklet calling on Republicans to launch propaganda activities in various places to win the people to vote against in the "referendum."

A group of tenant farmer organizations, led by the tenant farmer organizations in Pau in the Charente province and Dax in the Landes province, also publicly stated that they will vote against in the "referendum."

At the congress held by the French Socialist Party organization in Basses-Alpes province on the 1st, the majority of representatives expressed opposition to de Gaulle's draft "constitution."

The Radical Socialist Party organization of Deux-Sèvres province unanimously passed a resolution at a meeting in Niort condemning de Gaulle's draft "constitution."

Eighteen well-known agricultural experts in the Ain province also jointly opposed the new draft "constitution."

The National Committee of People's Relief also called on all members to vote against this draft "constitution" on September 28.

    戴高乐叫卖独裁宪法
    法国人民说：“不！”
    新华社5日讯　巴黎消息：依靠军事暴乱的支持上台的法国总理戴高乐，昨天在军警戒备森严的巴黎“共和国广场”发表演说，兜售他的独裁“宪法”草案。在“共和国广场”周围，许许多多的法国人愤怒地高呼：“对戴高乐说：‘不’！”“不让法西斯主义得逞！”
    早在戴高乐预定发表演说的时间以前好几个钟头，就已经有大批警察和便衣在“共和国广场”周围布满了岗哨；只有拿着请贴和特别通行证的人才许入场。消防队也调来协助警察。在广场上空，警察方面的直升飞机在低飞盘旋。广场四周的楼房的阳台和窗口都有警探。通向广场的路都由头戴钢盔的“共和国保安队”把守。同时，反对法西斯独裁的法国人民响应法国共产党、“反法西斯委员会”及其他民主组织的号召，他们打着旗帜，喊着口号，秩序井然地分好几路向“共和国广场”前进。
    就在这样的情况下，戴高乐在广场的讲台上发表了演说，要法国人在9月28日举行“公民投票”时支持他为埋葬法国共和民主制度而制订的“宪法”草案。这部“宪法”使戴高乐能够独揽大权，使他有方便的借口来迫害法国共产党和一切民主力量，并且使议会成为他的独裁政权的装饰品。
    戴高乐在演说中极尽恫吓和哄骗之能事。他说，如果通过他的“宪法”草案，从而使国家获得“足够的力量和威望”，法兰西民族就会“再次繁荣起来”；反之，法兰西民族就会“灭亡”。他并不讳言，他的“宪法”草案通过后，担任总统职位的自己将成为所谓“民族裁决者”；他的不得人心的政府也将长期统治。
    同时，戴高乐又说，他的“宪法”并没有侵害人民的任何权利，也没有违反任何公共自由。
    但是，就在他发表演说的时候，专门镇压人民运动的特种警察在法西斯分子前伞兵部队人员的协助下，用催泪弹、马力和警棍向广场外要求自由和高唱国歌“马赛曲”的人民进攻，使得好多人受了伤。还有不少人被捕。
    被警察冲散的人们并没有屈服。他们在大街上重新集合起来，并且高呼：“不让法西斯主义得逞！”
    据新华社巴黎3日电　响应法国共产党的号召，数以千计的巴黎妇女昨天在巴黎阿兰布拉大厅举行大会，法国共产党总书记多列士在会上作了关于法国妇女为什么应该在全民投票时投反对票的讲话。
    多列士说，三个月以来，在法国建立了个人专权制度。这个独裁制度希望使人民批准它，从而变成永久的制度。
    多列士指出：戴高乐宪法如果被通过，将导致法西斯制度，而法西斯制度意味着取消妇女的一切权利，把她们变成奴隶。
    多列士最后向参加会议的妇女们指出她们的任务是在全民投票时投反对票，并使妇女群众一起投反对票。
    据新华社巴黎3日电　随着“公民投票”日期的日益临近，法国各地人民反对戴高乐的“宪法”草案的运动也越来越高涨。
    由四十五个组织的代表组成的默尔特—摩泽尔省“保卫共和国委员会”，号召人民在9月28日投反对票。
    布勒斯特共和行动委员会出版了一本小册子，号召共和人士在各地展开宣传活动，争取人民在“公民投票”中投反对票。
    以夏朗德省波城和朗德省达克士两地的佃农组织为首的一批佃农组织，也公开表示它们将在“公民投票”时投反对票。
    在下阿尔卑斯省法国社会党组织1日举行的代表大会上，大多数代表表示反对戴高乐的“宪法”草案。
    双塞夫勒省激进社会党组织在尼奥尔举行的会议上一致通过了一项决议，谴责戴高乐的“宪法”草案。
    安省十八名著名的农业专家也联名反对新“宪法”草案。
    人民救济会全国委员会也号召全体会员在9月28日投票反对这个“宪法”草案。
