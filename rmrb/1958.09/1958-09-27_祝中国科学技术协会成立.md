    Congratulating the Establishment of the China Association for Science and Technology
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    The national representative conferences of the All-China Federation of Specialized Societies and the All-China Association for Science Popularization, also known as the First National Congress of the China Association for Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, successfully concluded on the 25th of this month. A unified, national socialist science and technology organization—the China Association for Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China—has been born. This is a major event in China's science and technology community. We warmly congratulate the establishment of the China Association for Science and Technology. The Science Federation and Science Popularization Association have done a lot of work and achieved considerable results over the past eight years, but the coexistence of the two organizations and the separation of popularization from advancement can no longer adapt to the situation of the socialist Great Leap Forward. The conference resolution to merge the All-China Science Federation and the All-China Association for Science Popularization to establish the China Association for Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China is absolutely necessary.

    This representative conference mainly clarified two issues: first, the path of China's science and technology work; and second, the direction of China's science and technology organizations. Because the conference's more than one thousand representatives included representatives from various aspects of the central government, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, reflecting various different viewpoints, on the first issue, everyone unanimously agreed with Comrade Nie Rongzhen's opinions in his report, that is, to resolutely implement the Party's leadership over scientific work, put politics in command, bring into play the communist spirit in scientific work, criticize the bourgeois traditions in scientific work, and eliminate the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie. To summarize, it is to liberate thought, break down superstitions; proceed from the tasks of socialist construction; make comprehensive plans; and follow the mass line. On the second issue, it once aroused widespread and heated discussions. After thorough democratic discussions such as large-scale airing of views, large-scale debates, and big-character posters, after thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois view of regarding scientific and technological organizations as a "forbidden zone" "unreachable" by a few people, emphasizing "qualifications," closing the door to workers, peasants, and young intellectuals, and detaching from the masses and reality, under the general policy of mobilizing all positive factors to build socialism, the opinions from all sides were unified on a new basis. Everyone unanimously believes that the rapid development of socialist construction in our country urgently requires a greater leap forward in science and technology work, and requires the whole Party and the whole people to vigorously develop science and technology and launch a mass movement of technological revolution. The establishment of the China Association for Science and Technology constitutes a powerful tool and assistant for the Party to mobilize the broad masses of scientific and technological workers and the broad masses of the people to carry out technological and cultural revolutions. Because the basic task of the China Association for Science and Technology is, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to closely integrate with production and carry out mass movements of technological revolution. The path of bourgeois scientific organizations is not in line with the interests of socialism. It must be transformed in accordance with socialist principles in order to shoulder the glorious combat task of building socialism.

    Using the mass movement method to develop science and technology is an extremely important characteristic of China's scientific undertakings. All science and technology departments should follow the mass line, and the China Association for Science and Technology, as a science and technology organization, should play a huge role in the mass movement of technological revolution. Ten thousand times the facts have proved that the wisdom and talent of workers, peasants, and young people are endless. Letting go to mobilize the masses, enthusiastically helping the masses, and using the mass movement method to lead the mass movement of technological revolution will surely make China's science and technology work shine brilliantly in the socialist Great Leap Forward.

    In order to call on and encourage the national science and technology community and the broad masses of the people to carry out heroic struggles on the front lines of technological revolution, this conference made two extremely important resolutions:

    First, based on the solemn call by Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to "fight hard for three years, fundamentally change the face of science and technology in our country, and strive to complete the twelve-year science and technology plan five years ahead of schedule, that is, in 1962," the conference made a corresponding resolution. This is of very great significance. The early completion of the scientific plan will enable China's science and technology to reach the world's advanced level within the second five-year plan. This is of great significance for building socialism ahead of schedule, for the East wind further prevailing over the West wind, and for defending peace in the Far East and the world. Such a high-speed development of scientific undertakings can be fully achieved under the policy of the whole people putting politics in command, liberating their minds, and the whole Party and the whole people running science.

    Second, this representative conference also made a resolution on launching a science and technology gift-giving movement nationwide for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and convening a representative conference of activists in scientific and technological inventions and creations next September. This will have an extraordinarily huge effect on inspiring the national science and technology community and the broad masses of the people. Next year will be a year of even greater leaps forward in China's industrial and agricultural production, and it will be the second year of our three years of hard work on the science and technology front. The resolution of the Science Association's representative conference to launch a gift-giving movement and convene a representative meeting of activists will launch a socialist competition in science and technology work throughout the country, effectively promote the mass movement of technological revolution, and Party committees at all levels will also strengthen their leadership over this movement. It can be expected that when we comprehensively review our work on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we will definitely obtain, and we will definitely be able to obtain, a large number of brilliant achievements in science and technology work.

    Now, under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, the people of our country are fighting heroically day and night to overfulfill the tasks of industrial and agricultural production and to oppose American armed provocations. We believe that after the spirit of this conference is conveyed, all members will center on the "three marshals and two pioneers" and contribute their greatest strength.

    祝中国科学技术协会成立
    本报评论员
    中华全国专门学会联合会和中华全国科学普及协会全国代表大会，也就是中华人民共和国科学技术协会第一次全国代表大会，在本月25日胜利闭幕，一个统一的全国性的社会主义的科学技术团体——中华人民共和国科学技术协会已经诞生，这是我国科学技术界的一件大事，我们热烈祝颂中国科协的成立。科联、科普两个团体八年来作了不少工作，有不小的成绩，但两个团体并存，把普及和提高机械分开，已完全不能适应社会主义大跃进的形势，大会决议把全国科联和全国科普两个团体合并，建立中华人民共和国科学技术协会，是完全必要的。
    这次代表大会主要明确了两个问题：一是我国科学技术工作的道路问题，二是我国科学技术团体的方向问题。由于这次大会的一千余代表中，包括中央和各省、市、自治区各方面的代表，反映了各种不同的观点，在第一个问题上，大家一致同意聂荣臻同志在报告中的意见，即坚决贯彻党对科学工作的领导，政治挂帅，在科学工作中发挥共产主义精神，批判科学工作中资产阶级的传统，清除资产阶级的思想影响。概括地说，就是解放思想，破除迷信；从社会主义建设任务出发；全面规划；走群众路线。在第二个问题上，曾经引起广泛而热烈的讨论，经过大鸣大放，大争大辩，大字报等充分的民主讨论，在彻底批判了资产阶级的把科学技术团体视为少数人“高不可攀”的“禁地”，强调“资格”，向工农和青年知识分子关门，脱离群众，脱离实际的观念之后，在调动一切积极因素建设社会主义的总方针下，把各方面的意见在新的基础上统一起来了。大家一致认为：我国社会主义建设的飞跃发展，迫切要求科学技术工作更大地跃进，要求全党全民大办科学事业，大搞技术革命的群众运动，中国科协的成立，就是组成了党动员广大科学技术工作者和广大人民群众进行技术革命文化革命的一个有力的工具和助手。因为，中国科协的基本任务就是在中国共产党的领导下，密切结合生产，开展技术革命的群众运动的。资产阶级科学团体的道路，是不合乎社会主义的利益的。必须按照社会主义原则加以改造，才能担负起建设社会主义的光荣的战斗任务。
    用群众运动的方法来发展科学技术是我国科学事业中一个极为重要的特点。一切科学技术部门都应当走群众路线，中国科协这个科学技术团体更应在技术革命的群众运动中发挥巨大的作用。千万次的事实已经证明，工人、农民、青年人的智慧和才能，是无穷无尽的，放手去发动群众，热情去帮助群众，用群众运动的方法来领导技术革命的群众运动，一定能使我国科学技术工作在社会主义大跃进中大放异彩。
    为了号召和鼓舞全国科学技术界和广大人民群众在技术革命的战线上进行英勇的战斗，这次大会作出两个极为重要的决议：
    一、大会根据聂荣臻副总理代表党中央和国务院提出的“苦战三年、基本改变我国科学技术面貌，争取提前五年，即在1962年完成十二年科学技术规划”的庄严号召，作出了相应的决议。这是具有非常重大意义的。科学规划的提前完成，将使我国科学技术在第二个五年计划内达到世界先进水平。这对于提前建成社会主义，东风进一步压倒西风，保卫远东和世界和平，都具有重大意义。这样高速度地发展科学事业，在全国人民政治挂帅、解放思想、全党全民办科学的方针下，是完全能够做到的。
    二、这次代表大会又作出了关于在全国开展建国十周年科学技术献礼运动和在明年九月召开科学技术发明创造积极分子代表大会的决议。这对于鼓舞全国科学技术界和广大人民有异常巨大的作用。明年将是我国工农业生产更大跃进的一年，是我们在科学技术战线上苦战三年的第二年。科协代表大会决议开展献礼运动、召开积极分子代表会议，在全国范围内将开展科学技术工作的社会主义竞赛，有效地促进技术革命的群众运动，各级党委也将对这一运动加强领导。可以预期，在建国十周年全面检阅我们工作的时候，在科学技术工作方面一定会得到，也一定可以得到大量的辉煌战果。
    现在我国人民正在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，为超额完成工农业生产任务和反对美国武装挑衅而夜以继日地英勇奋战。我们相信，这次会议的精神传达后全体会员将以“三大元帅，两个先行”为中心，贡献出自己的最大力量。
