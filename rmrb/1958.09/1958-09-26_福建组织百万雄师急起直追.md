According to the Fujian Daily, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a telephone conference of prefectural and municipal Party committee secretaries at midnight on the 18th. Comrade Jiang Yizhen, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, representing the Provincial Committee, called upon the entire Party and all the people to work hard for three days and nights, demanding that a daily output of 2,000 to 3,000 tons of iron be a gift from the people of the province to the 1958 National Day. After October, the province will build 10,000 iron smelting furnaces, so that the daily output of pig iron in the province will continue to jump to 3,500 tons to 4,000 tons.

Comrade Jiang Yizhen said that to ensure that the output of pig iron jumps to 2,000 to 3,000 tons, it mainly relies on the existing 3,900 iron furnaces and the 2,500 iron furnaces under construction. To ensure the completion of the annual task, roughly 4,000 more furnaces need to be built in the province, so that more than 10,000 furnaces in the province will be put into production in October.

Comrade Jiang Yizhen said that in order to ensure a new leap forward in steel production, the province needs one million people to join the steel front. From the perspective of leadership, all localities should quickly shift their leadership focus to steel production. Two-thirds of the secretaries and members of the Party committees of prefectures and key counties should focus on steel, and general counties should also devote half of their efforts to steel.

In order to make iron smelting production jump up quickly, iron smelting production must be regarded as a major battle, and battles require a high degree of concentration and unity. Localism and decentralization are absolutely not allowed. The Provincial Committee has decided to build large furnace clusters in key areas, which will inevitably require the mobilization of some manpower, power machinery, tools, etc. If necessary, the generators in the county towns of some counties must also be mobilized as power for iron smelting. Without this determination, it will be difficult to complete this year's steel production task. All regions and departments should obey unified allocation. Any power machinery and generators that are not urgently needed should be taken out, regardless of any organs or departments. All departments and organs should immediately clean up their warehouses and take out all power machinery and other equipment that can be used for steel production. After steel production leaps forward, transportation will inevitably become more tense. The transportation vehicles of all organs and schools should be adjusted to serve steel production.

    福建组织百万雄师急起直追
    据福建日报消息  中共福建省委在18日午夜召开了地、市委书记电话会议，省委书记江一真同志在会上代表省委号召全党全民苦战三昼夜，要求以日产二千吨至三千吨铁作为全省人民向1958年国庆的献礼。在10月份以后，全省共要建成万座炼铁炉，使全省生铁日产量继续跃至三千五百吨到四千吨。
    江一真同志说，要保证生铁产量跳跃到二千吨至三千吨，主要依靠现有三千九百多铁炉和正在建的二千五百个铁炉。为保证完成全年任务，大体上全省还要建四千个炉子，使在10月份内全省共有一万座以上炉子投入生产。
    江一真同志说，为保证钢铁生产出现一个新的飞跃形势，全省需要有一百万人投入钢铁战线。从领导力量来看，各地应迅速把领导精力转到钢铁生产上，地委和重点县的县委要有三分之二的书记和委员来抓钢铁，一般县也要拿出半数力量来抓钢铁。
    为使炼铁生产能迅速跃上去，必须把炼铁生产当作一场大战，作战就要求高度的集中统一。绝不许有本位主义和分散现象。省委决定在重点地区建大炉群，这就必然要调动一部分人力、动力机、工具等等，有些县县城里的发电机，必要时也要调动出来作炼铁的动力，不下这个狠心，要完成今年钢铁的生产任务是困难的。各个地区和各个部门都应服从统一调配，不是急需的动力机、发电机不论任何机关任何部门都要调出来，各部门、机关立即清理一下仓库，把可以用于钢铁生产的动力机等设备，都拿出来。钢铁生产跃上后，运输必然更加紧张，各机关、学校的运输车辆都要调整出来，为钢铁生产服务。
