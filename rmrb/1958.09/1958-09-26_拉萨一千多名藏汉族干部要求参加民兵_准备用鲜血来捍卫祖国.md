Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 24th—More than 1,300 Tibetan and Han cadres constructing a highway near Lhasa have resolutely supported Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and have actively signed up to join the militia, prepared to defend the integrity of the motherland's territory with their blood.

When Dulles's clamor about continuing armed aggression against our country reached the construction site, the valley, which was originally filled with the sounds of peaceful labor, was instantly swept up in a wave of anger. People held meetings at the construction site and wrote many letters of determination and guarantee, handing them over to the road construction headquarters. They unanimously demanded to be armed, to establish militia organizations, and to make all preparations to counterattack American imperialist aggression. They said, "We can use our hands to build the motherland, and we can also use our hands to defend every inch of the motherland's land."

    拉萨一千多名藏汉族干部要求参加民兵
    准备用鲜血来捍卫祖国
    新华社拉萨24日电  正在拉萨近郊修筑公路的藏族、汉族干部一千三百多人，坚决拥护陈毅外长的声明，并纷纷报名要求参加民兵队伍，准备着用鲜血来保卫祖国领土的完整。
    当杜勒斯叫嚣要继续对我国进行武装侵略的消息传到工地以后，这条本来洋溢着和平劳动声音的山谷里，顿时沸腾起愤怒的浪潮。人们在工地上举行了集会，并写了许多决心书和保证书，交给修路指挥部。他们一致要求武装起来，成立民兵组织，做好一切准备，回击美帝国主义的侵略。他们说：“我们能用双手建设祖国，也就能用双手保卫祖国的每一寸土地。”
