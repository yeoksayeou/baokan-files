Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 21st. People from all walks of life in Sichuan Province resolutely support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement refuting Dulles' speech at the United Nations General Assembly.

    Although today is Sunday, more than 100,000 workers in Chengdu are still working hard. Early in the morning, after seeing Foreign Minister Chen Yi's solemn statement, they applauded and expressed their determination to smash the US's "ceasefire" fallacy with practical actions and resolutely fight to the end to safeguard the motherland's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory has just established a militia battalion of more than 4,000 people today; at the same time, the foundation project of the steelmaking workshop in this factory was also completed today. They said that after hearing Foreign Minister Chen's statement, they decided to answer the US imperialists' war provocations with the action of struggling hard for forty days to ensure the smooth flow of molten steel.

    The Jinniu People's Commune in the suburbs of Chengdu, which has just been established, is holding a meeting of all commune cadres today to study how to further consolidate the People's Commune. After seeing Foreign Minister Chen's statement published in the newspaper, they unanimously expressed their support for Foreign Minister Chen's rebuttal of Dulles' fallacies. Zhang Xirong, the former director of the Friendship Cooperative and now the deputy director of the Jinniu People's Commune, said that Dulles' speech was simply the greatest insult to the 600 million Chinese people. It is "aggression" for the Chinese people to recover their own Jinmen and Mazu, but it is not aggression for the United States to send armed forces to Chinese territory thousands of miles away from the United States. Isn't this deliberately reversing black and white and confusing right and wrong? The entire commune decided to complete 107 tons of iron smelting before the 22nd, strengthen deep plowing and land leveling work, and strengthen militia combat readiness training to support Foreign Minister Chen's statement and give the US aggressors a resolute rebuff.

    Leading figures of various democratic parties and non-party democrats in Sichuan Province have issued statements one after another, supporting Foreign Minister Chen's statement. Liu Wenhui, Vice Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial CPPCC, said: I fully support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement. The Chinese people are determined to recover Jinmen and Mazu and to liberate Taiwan and Penghu. This is the Chinese people's own sovereignty. This is entirely an internal affair and no interference from US imperialism is allowed. Deng Xihou, Vice Governor of Sichuan Province, said that the US aggressors, ignoring the warnings of the Chinese people, continue to pursue a policy of brinkmanship, and send a large number of troops to Taiwan to invade Chinese territory, which has created the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait. This is obvious to everyone. Only when the US military withdraws from Taiwan will the tense situation be eliminated. Tong Shaosheng, Vice Governor of Sichuan Province and a person from business and industry, said: Dulles' absurd remarks have aroused our incomparable anger. Under the leadership of the Party, we people from business and industry, together with the people of the whole country, must have the confidence and determination to both adhere to socialist construction and give the US imperialists a head-on blow. Zhang Xiushu, Vice Governor of Sichuan Province and a person from the education sector, said: The US imperialist aggressors have repeatedly expanded their provocations, and Dulles has also issued remarks slandering us. We want to warn Dulles that the Chinese people love peace, but they are not afraid of war. If imperialism insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, then the people of the whole country will unite as one and resolutely eliminate the aggressors.

    团结一致坚决消灭侵略者
    四川各界人民决心为保卫祖国而战
    新华社成都21日电　四川省各界人民坚决拥护陈毅外交部长驳斥杜勒斯在联合国大会上发言的声明。
    今天虽然是星期日，但是成都市十万多工人仍在紧张地劳动，一早，他们看到陈毅外长的严正声明后，都拍手称快。他们表示决心要以实际行动粉碎美国的“停火”谰言，坚决为维护祖国主权和领土完整而斗争到底。成都量具刃具厂，今天刚刚成立一支拥有四千多人的民兵大队；同时，这个厂炼钢车间的基座工程也在今天完成。他们说，我们听到陈外长的声明后，决定以苦战四十天使钢水畅流的行动，来回答美帝的战争挑衅。
    刚刚建成的成都市郊区金牛人民公社，今天正在开全社干部会议，研究如何进一步巩固人民公社的问题。当他们看到报纸上登载的陈外长声明后，一致表示拥护陈外长对杜勒斯谬论的驳斥。原友谊社主任、现在是金牛人民公社副主任张锡荣说，杜勒斯的讲话简直是对全中国六亿人的最大侮辱。中国人民收复自己的金门、马祖，反倒是“侵略”，美国把武装部队开到远离美国几千里的中国领土上来反倒不是侵略，这岂不是有意颠倒黑白、淆乱是非。全社决定在22日以前，完成炼铁一百零七吨，加强深耕和平整土地工作，加强民兵战备训练，来拥护陈外长声明，给美国侵略者以坚决回击。
    四川省各民主党派、无党派民主人士的负责人纷纷发表谈话，拥护陈外长声明。四川省政协副主席刘文辉说：陈毅外交部长的声明我完全拥护，中国人民坚决要收复金门、马祖，要解放台湾、澎湖，这是中国人民自己的主权，这完全是内政，决不容许美帝国主义干涉。四川省副省长邓锡侯说，美国侵略者不顾中国人民的警告，继续进行战争边缘政策，把大批军队调到台湾，对中国领土进行侵略才造成台湾海峡的紧张局势，这是人人可以看得出的。只有美军撤出台湾，紧张局势才会消除。四川省副省长、工商界人士童少生说：杜勒斯的荒谬言论，引起了我们的无比愤怒。我们工商界人士在党的领导下，和全国人民一道，一定有信心有决心，一面坚持社会主义建设，一面给美帝以迎头痛击。四川省副省长、教育界人士张秀熟说：美帝侵略者屡次扩大挑衅，杜勒斯又发表诬蔑我们的言论，我们要警告杜勒斯，中国人民热爱和平，但是也不怕战争。如果帝国主义硬要把战争强加在中国人民头上，那全国人民必将团结一致，坚决消灭侵略者。
