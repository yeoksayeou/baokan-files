Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 22nd: The broad masses of people in Jilin Province have gathered to support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and expressed their firm opposition to Dulles' shameless slander, which distorts the truth. They said that Taiwan was already Chinese territory when Columbus discovered the New World, and the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is a matter of China's internal affairs and a continuation of the Liberation War. There is no such thing as a "ceasefire" at all. Workers have also revised their production and construction plans, expressing their intention to strike at the American aggressors with practical actions and resolutely recover Jinmen and Mazu and liberate Taiwan. The Jilin City Steel Plant originally planned to produce steel on "October 1st," but now guarantees to produce steel ahead of schedule on September 28th. The plant originally planned to produce 1,440 tons of steel this year, but now it has been increased to 2,000 tons.

In order to be ready to resist the aggression of American imperialism at any time, the broad masses of workers, peasants, cadres, and students in various parts of Jilin Province have signed up to join the militia organizations, directly engaged in military training, and are ready to respond to the call of the motherland and take up guns to strike at the American imperialist aggressors. In Changchun City, nearly a hundred factories, shops, and universities have established militia divisions or militia regiments, battalions, and companies. At the founding meetings of various factory militia divisions and regiments, all commanders and fighters vowed to operate machines with one hand and pick up guns with the other, using excellent production and martial arts achievements to resist the aggression of American imperialism. The militia teams of Changchun Automobile and Tractor Institute have launched a large-scale military training movement these days, planning to enable all soldiers to reach the level of sharpshooters in one month, and plan to train 500 tank soldiers and 1,000 motorcycle soldiers within one year.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 22nd: People from all walks of life in Harbin gathered yesterday to support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and refuted the shameless slander of US Secretary of State Dulles.

More than 3,600 employees of the First Construction Engineering Company of Harbin City gathered at various construction sites yesterday. Wang Shaogeng, head of the technology section, said that Dulles played the "ceasefire" conspiracy and slandered our country as "aggression." Is it our warships that are going to the United States to fight? This war monger is so shameless to reverse black and white. Wang Shaogeng advocated that all employees produce during the day and train at night, not only to create new records in production, but also to train the militia well and meticulously. All the employees of the 105 construction site of this engineering company proposed to complete the construction of ten small blast furnaces two weeks in advance, and let these small blast furnaces produce molten iron before the National Day. All the employees of the First Construction Site of the Second Engineering Company of Heilongjiang Province also proposed to guarantee the completion of the construction task of the steel casting plant 23 days in advance, and to severely fight back against these American aggressors with practical actions.

Students and teachers of major universities and middle schools who are studying and working while strengthening militia military training, also gathered after seeing Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement. Hong Jing, associate professor of Harbin Institute of Technology, said that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement expressed the will of 600 million Chinese people. We must turn anger into strength, vigorously carry out technological revolution, and support the struggle to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and liberate Taiwan. The students of Northeast Forestry College who are building blast furnaces expressed their determination to speed up the construction and strive to complete the iron smelting blast furnace before the National Day. Under the leadership of the Communist Youth League, the students of No. 18 Middle School established the Youth Guard Regiment, and the teachers also demanded to be armed, ready to strike at the American aggressors at any time.
