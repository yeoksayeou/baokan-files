    Celebrating the Thirteenth Anniversary of the Founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    Nguyễn Khang, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of The Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the People's Republic of China
    Today is the thirteenth anniversary of the victory of the August Revolution in Vietnam, the declaration of independence, and the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On the occasion of this most glorious festival of the Vietnamese nation, I extend the warmest fraternal greetings to the great Chinese people with a very happy mood.
    The August Revolution of 1945 overthrew the rule of Japanese and French imperialists and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Supported by American imperialism, the French colonialists launched armed aggression against Vietnam again, attempting to put the criminal yoke on the Vietnamese people once more. The Vietnamese people carried out a sacred war of resistance for as long as nine years, and in the historically victorious Battle of Dien Bien Phu, they completely destroyed the colonialists' aggressive ambitions. The Geneva ceasefire agreement of 1954 enabled the restoration of peace throughout Indochina.
    Since the restoration of peace, all the Vietnamese people, from the North to the South, have continued to work hard in order to complete their national and people's democratic revolution, then build socialism in the completely liberated North Vietnam, and strive to achieve national reunification peacefully on the basis of independence and democracy, in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords.
    North Vietnam, having experienced fifteen years of war, is one of the most severely damaged areas. In a short period of peace, due to the spirit of hard work and selfless labor and creative wisdom, and with the dedicated help of fraternal countries, the Vietnamese people have victoriously ended the period of restoring the national economy and have begun to enter a new period of developing the economy and culture according to long-term plans, in order to gradually transition to socialism. Our people have completed two major tasks in North Vietnam: land reform and the restoration of the national economy, and are now beginning to develop culture. The earth-shaking land revolution of tens of millions of farmers has forever eliminated the land private ownership system under which the Vietnamese people have suffered the rule of the feudal landlord class for centuries; and it has opened the way for the glorious development of Vietnamese agriculture. Thanks to the liberation of labor forces, the level of food production has exceeded the highest pre-war annual output by more than 63% in only three years of peace. The frequent famines in North Vietnam, which the colonial feudal system deemed unavoidable, have been eradicated. In the past two years, North Vietnam has not only had sufficient food but also surplus grain for export in exchange for needed industrial products. This year, approximately 60% of farming households have joined mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives.
    Our people are very pleased with the achievements made in restoring and developing Vietnam's industry. Various industrial production units are expanding rapidly, much faster than before the war in all aspects: thirty-two old factories have been restored, some of which have been expanded and improved; fifty-three new factories have been built with modern machinery. Compared with 1955, the total output value of state-owned industry has increased ninefold. Handicraft industry has also developed rapidly, accounting for more than 58% of the total value of industrial products.
    Along with the recovery of the national economy, the development of culture has also achieved many important successes. Illiteracy will be fundamentally eliminated this year. The development of schools at all levels is also quite rapid. Not including the thousands of students studying abroad, the number of university and professional school students has increased eightfold compared to the total number of university students in pre-war Vietnam. Currently, there are a total of 1.01 million students in North Vietnam. The number of senior and intermediate level cadres in the health sector has increased ninefold compared to the pre-war period.
    While achieving successes in economic recovery and starting to develop culture, the lives of cadres, workers, and peasants have also gradually improved. In North Vietnam, the legacy of the imperialist colonialists - the problem of unemployment - has also been fundamentally solved. Looking forward to their bright future, the people of North Vietnam are going all out to realize their first long-term construction plan - the national three-year plan from 1958 to 1960, in order to gradually transition to a socialist society.
    Since the restoration of peace, American imperialism has controlled South Vietnam, supporting the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet regime as its agent, using all kinds of conspiracies to undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords, attempting to divide Vietnam for a long time, and then turn South Vietnam into a colony and military base of the United States, in order to plot a new war. Their brutal and vicious means aimed at enslaving South Vietnam, suppressing the South Vietnamese people who love their country, love peace, and seek progress, have plunged our people living in South Vietnam into a miserable and dark predicament. Throughout the period since the restoration of peace, all the Vietnamese people, whether from the North to the South, or overseas Vietnamese, have continued to inherit the spirit of revolutionary struggle, united as one, maintaining and upholding the banner of peace and national unification, and waging a tenacious struggle against American imperialism, demanding free general elections throughout the country in accordance with the Geneva Accords in order to unify the country. In this struggle, the South Vietnamese people have written a glorious page in the history of the anti-imperialist and national unification struggle. At present, a wave of responses to the March 7, 1958, letter from Pham Van Dong, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to the South Vietnamese authorities is sweeping across Vietnam, proposing mutual disarmament, trade, and restoration of normal relations between the peoples of the two regions, in order to create conditions for discussing the issue of national unification. The Vietnamese people's struggle is part of the struggle of Asian and African countries against imperialist colonialists, for national independence, and to defend their sovereign territorial integrity, and therefore, it has won the warm sympathy and support of powerful socialist countries, Asian countries, and peace-loving people all over the world. The Vietnamese people's confidence is as solid as a rock; they believe that their just struggle will surely be victorious, the conspiracies of American imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet regime to undermine peaceful reunification are bound to fail, and the cause of completing the national and people's democratic revolution throughout the country will surely succeed; this is something that no reactionary force can stop.
    The significant achievements made by the Vietnamese people in economic construction and the struggle for national unification demonstrate the superiority of the people's democratic system; it is the result of the hard work of the people of North Vietnam and the heroic spirit of unity and struggle of the people of South Vietnam, and the result of the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the beloved leader of the Vietnamese nation. These achievements are also the result of the valuable, selfless, and generous assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal socialist countries to the Vietnamese people.
    In international relations, the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have continuously strengthened friendship and solidarity with the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries in the socialist camp, developed friendly relations with Asian and African countries and other peace-loving countries, actively supported the national independence movements in colonial and dependent countries, and strived to make contributions to the cause of defending world peace. The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly welcome the recent Soviet-Chinese Communique, regarding it as a great contribution to consolidating the socialist camp and defending world peace, and a huge encouragement to all nations who are carrying out the struggle for liberation.
    China is our great brotherly neighbor. At the same time, China and we also have a common enemy, which is American imperialism, which occupies China's territory of Taiwan and creates tension in this region; it interferes in South Vietnam to obstruct the unification of our motherland. Therefore, the relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries is as close as lips and teeth, because if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold. Since the restoration of peace, this fraternal relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation has been more widely and deeply developed in all fields.
    Our people are very encouraged by the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people in the great leap forward in socialist construction under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government headed by Chairman Mao Zedong. After the fundamental completion of the socialist revolution in the economy, and after the victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, China's socialist revolution in economy, politics, and ideology has basically and brilliantly ended. With the liberation of thought, the Chinese working class and the working people are enthusiastically and bravely building their own motherland. From the cities to the countryside, from the plains to the mountains, the bright line of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and Chairman Mao Zedong can be seen everywhere, and the communist style is deeply penetrating the hearts of the Chinese people, creating a boiling force that promotes the great leap forward in the construction of industry, agriculture, science, and technology. According to the general line of "more, faster, better, and more economical" socialist construction, China's industrial construction is developing harmoniously from the central to the local levels, and its speed is unprecedented, which makes people believe that in a short period of time, the great China will surely have a complete and advanced industry. In parallel with industrial construction, China's agricultural production has also achieved tremendous development like a whirlwind, and the rapid surge in its output is unprecedented in the world.
    The fact that China has successively launched "satellites" in all aspects of socialist construction eloquently proves that the slogan that China will catch up with and surpass Britain in steel and other major industrial product outputs in a not-so-long period of time will become a reality. These great victories demonstrate the superiority of socialism; it demonstrates the scientific correctness and creativity of the Marxist-Leninist line of the great Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. The great China has already achieved great achievements; it has made positive contributions to the cause of world peace and cooperation, and its international position is becoming increasingly consolidated and brilliant. The stubborn enemies of the Chinese people who are still unwilling to admit the facts will eventually be forced to bow their heads and admit defeat.
    The achievements made by the Chinese people, coupled with the victories of the rapid construction of socialism in other fraternal countries, are making the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union even stronger. The Vietnamese people are very proud of the achievements made by the Chinese people and regard these achievements as their own. On behalf of the Vietnamese people, I would like to congratulate the Chinese people on achieving many greater achievements and miracles in the current Great Leap Forward movement.
    Congratulations on the continuous development of fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation between Vietnam and China!
    May the unity and friendship between Vietnam and China last forever!

    庆祝越南民主共和国成立十三周年
    越南民主共和国驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使　阮康
    今天是越南八月革命胜利、宣布独立和成立越南民主共和国十三周年纪念日。值此越南民族最光荣的节日来临之际，我怀着非常愉快的心情，向伟大的中国人民致最热烈的兄弟的敬意。
    1945年八月革命推翻了日、法帝国主义者的统治，并建立了越南民主共和国。法国殖民者在美帝国主义的扶持下，重又向越南进行武装侵略，妄图再一次地把罪恶的枷锁套在越南人民头上。越南人民进行了长达九年之久的神圣的抗战，在具有历史性胜利的奠边府战役中，彻底摧毁了殖民者的侵略野心。1954年的日内瓦停战协议，使整个印度支那得以恢复和平。
    自从和平恢复以来，从北方到南方的全体越南人民，继续努力奋斗，以便完成自己的民族和人民民主革命，进而在完全解放了的越南北方建设社会主义，并为在独立和民主的基础上，根据日内瓦协议的规定，以和平方式来实现国家统一而斗争。
    越南北方经历了十五年的战争，是一个遭受破坏最严重的地区。在短短的和平期间，由于发挥勤劳的忘我的劳动精神和创造的智慧，同时由于各兄弟国家尽心竭力的帮助，因此，越南人民已胜利地结束了恢复国民经济的时期，并开始进入根据长期规划发展经济和文化，以便逐步过渡到社会主义的新时期。我国人民已经在越南北方完成了两大任务：这就是土地改革和恢复国民经济，目前正开始着手发展文化。成千万农民翻天复地的土地革命，使多少世纪以来越南人民遭受封建地主阶级统治的土地私有制永远消灭了；并给越南农业的辉煌发展开辟了道路。由于解放了劳动力，仅在三年的和平期间，粮食的生产水平已超过战前最高年产量的63％以上。殖民封建制度认为无法避免的越南北方经常发生的饥荒，已根本被扑灭了。近两年来，越南北方不但有充足的粮食，而且还有余粮对外输出，换取所需要的工业产品。在今年内，约有60％左右的农户加入变工互助组和农业合作社。
    我国人民对恢复和发展越南工业方面所取得的成就感到十分高兴。各个工业生产单位有着迅速的扩展，不论在任何方面都比战前快得多：三十二个旧工厂已恢复，其中有一部分已扩展和改进了；五十三个新工厂是用现代化机器建设起来的。如果和1955年比较，国营工业总产值增长了九倍。手工业也得到迅速的发展，它已占工业品总价值的58％以上。
    伴随着国民经济的恢复，文化方面的发展工作也取得不少重要成就。在今年内，文盲将要被根本肃清。各级学校的发展也相当迅速。除了几千名留学生还未计算在内之外，大学生和专业学校学生如果和战前全越大学生总数比较，即增加了八倍。目下，越南北方学生共有一百零一万名。卫生部门的高级和中级干部比战前增加了九倍。
    在恢复经济取得成就和开始发展文化的同时，干部和工农大众的生活也逐步得到改善。在越南北方，帝国主义殖民者的遗产——失业问题，也根本上得到了解决。瞻望自己光辉的前途，越南北方人民正鼓足干劲，以求实现头一个长期建设规划——从1958年到1960年国家三年计划，以便逐步过渡到社会主义社会。
    自从和平恢复以来，美帝国主义已控制了越南南方，扶植吴庭艳伪政权作为它的代理人，用种种阴谋来破坏日内瓦协议的履行，妄图长期分割越南，进而把越南南方变为美国的殖民地和军事基地，以利策划新战争。他们那种旨在奴役越南南方，镇压爱祖国、爱和平和求进步的越南南方人民的残暴毒辣的手段，使我们生活在越南南方的人民陷于悲惨和阴暗的困境里。自从和平恢复以来的整个时间内，不论是从北方到南方的全体越南人民，或是海外越侨，仍然继承着革命斗争传统精神，团结一致，保持和高举着和平和统一祖国的旗帜，对美帝国主义作坚韧的斗争，要求按照日内瓦协议规定在全国范围内进行自由普选，以便统一国家。在这种斗争中，越南南方人民已在反帝和统一祖国的斗争史上写下光辉的一页。目前越南全国各地正在掀起响应1958年3月7日越南民主共和国总理范文同给南越当局的公函中关于双方裁军，互通贸易，并恢复两个地区人民之间的正常关系，以便给讨论祖国统一问题创造条件的建议。越南人民的斗争是各亚非国家反对帝国主义殖民者，争取民族独立，保卫主权领土完整的斗争的一部分，因此，赢得了强大的社会主义国家、亚洲国家以及全世界爱好和平的人民的热烈同情和支援。越南人民的信心坚如磐石，他们相信自己正义的斗争一定胜利，美帝国主义和吴庭艳伪政权妄图破坏和平统一的阴谋一定要遭到失败，在全国完成民族和人民民主革命阶段的事业将一定成功，这是任何反动势力所不能阻挡得住的。
    越南人民在经济建设和争取国家统一斗争中所取得的重大成就，表明着人民民主制度的优越性，它是越南北方人民辛勤劳动和越南南方人民团结斗争的英勇精神的结果，是越南劳动党和越南民族敬爱的领袖胡志明主席正确领导的结果。这些成绩的获得，同时也是苏联、中国以及其他社会主义兄弟国家对越南人民宝贵、无私和慷慨的援助的结果。
    在国际关系方面，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府不断增强和苏联、中国以及社会主义阵营中的其他兄弟国家间的友谊团结，发展和亚非各国以及其他爱好和平国家间的友好关系，积极支持各殖民地和附属国家的民族独立运动，努力为保卫世界和平事业作出贡献。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府热烈欢迎最近的苏中会谈公报，把它看作是对巩固社会主义阵营、保卫世界和平的伟大贡献，同时对正在进行争取解放斗争的各民族是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    中国是我们伟大的兄弟邻邦。同时，中国和我们也有一个共同的敌人，那就是美帝国主义，它侵占中国的领土台湾，并在这个地区制造紧张局势；它干涉越南南方阻挠我们祖国的统一。因此，我们两国间的互助合作关系实在像唇齿一般的密切，因为唇亡齿就寒。自从和平恢复以来，这种兄弟般的互助合作关系，在所有的领域内更加得到广泛和深刻的发展。
    我国人民对中国人民在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党和中国政府的英明领导下，在社会主义建设大跃进中所获得的辉煌成就感到非常振奋。在经济上的社会主义革命根本完成之后，以及在整风运动和反右派斗争取得胜利之后，中国在经济、政治、思想上的社会主义革命已基本上辉煌地胜利结束。由于思想得到解放，中国工人阶级和劳动人民正在兴致勃勃和勇敢地建设自己的祖国。从城市到农村，从平原到山区，到处都可看到中国共产党、中国政府和毛泽东主席的光明路线，以及共产主义风格正在深透入中国人民的心灵中去，它造成一种沸腾的力量，促进着工业、农业、科学技术等方面的建设事业大跃进。根据“多、快、好、省”的社会主义建设总路线，中国的工业建设从中央到地方也都正在协调地发展着，它的速度是史无前例的，这使人们可以相信，再过一个短期间，伟大的中国必将有一个完整的先进的工业。与工业建设同时并举，中国的农业生产也像风驰电掣般得到巨大的发展，其产量的迅速激增是世界上空前未有的。
    中国在社会主义建设各方面陆续放射出的“卫星”的事实，雄辩地证明了中国在不长的时间内将在钢铁和在其他主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国的口号将成为现实。这些巨大的胜利表明了社会主义的优越性，它表明着伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义路线的科学正确性和创造性。伟大的中国已经取得了伟大的成就，它对世界和平合作事业作出了积极的贡献，它在国际上的地位正在日益稳固和光辉灿烂。至今还不愿承认事实的中国人民的顽固敌人，他们终究是要被迫俯首认输的。
    中国人民所取得的成就，再加上其他兄弟国家迅速建设社会主义的胜利，正在使以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量更加强大。越南人民对中国人民所取得的成绩感到非常自豪，并把这些成就看作是自己的成就一样。我谨代表越南人民祝贺中国人民在目前的大跃进运动中取得许多更加巨大的成就和奇迹。
    祝贺越中两国间兄弟般的互助合作不断发展！
    祝贺越中两国间的团结友谊万世长存！
