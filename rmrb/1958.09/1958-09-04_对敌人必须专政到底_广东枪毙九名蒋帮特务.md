Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd—The Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court and the Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate People's Court sentenced nine Chiang Kai-shek gang secret agents to death on August 28th.

　　These nine secret agents were: Li Zijie, Deng Guanglin, Wu Man'an, Mai Zhong, Zeng Chinan, Zhu Mao, Liang Yichang, Huang Lixing, and Cai Bingsen. With the exception of Huang Lixing, who was an airborne agent, the rest were dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek gang's secret service agencies in Hong Kong and Macau to Guangdong Province to carry out various sabotage activities, such as assassination, arson, bombing, poisoning, and distributing reactionary leaflets. Their conspiracies were thwarted and uncovered by our public security organs with the assistance of the broad masses.

　　The secret agents Li Zijie and Deng Guanglin, who were sentenced to death by the Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate People's Court according to law, were criminals dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek gang secret service agencies in Hong Kong in September and October of last year to carry out bombing activities in Guangzhou. Last year, the Chiang Kai-shek gang secret service agencies formulated an action plan for bombing and so-called "psychological warfare," conspiring to conduct a large-scale bombing, arson, and riot in Guangzhou around the National Day in order to support the right-wing elements' frantic attacks on the Party and the People's Government. The targets of this conspiracy included dozens of factories, warehouses, government offices, wharves, parks, cinemas, and buses. They also conspired to distribute reactionary leaflets in public places while carrying out the bombings. Secret agent Li Zijie joined the Chiang Kai-shek gang's "National Security Bureau Intelligence Bureau" secret service organization in Hong Kong in September 1957. After the secret service agency trained him in bombing techniques, it ordered him to sneak back to Guangzhou to bomb the bridges on Shamian Island, the Bund, the entrance of the YMCA, and the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Building. After sneaking into Guangzhou on October 23rd last year, Li went to the aforementioned locations the next day to observe the terrain and determined to bomb the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Building on the evening of October 26th or 27th. He planned to buy a train ticket back to Hong Kong before taking action and escape back to Hong Kong immediately after completing the bombing. However, while he was carrying out these criminal activities, he was captured by our public security organs with the help of the masses, and incriminating evidence such as explosives and detonators were seized. Secret agent Deng Guanglin joined the Chiang Kai-shek gang's "Central Committee" secret service organization in Hong Kong in 1955 and was appointed as a "transportation liaison officer" in Hong Kong. In 1956, he sneaked into Guangzhou to carry out secret service activities. In September 1957, after accepting the task of distributing reactionary leaflets and gathering information on other secret agents carrying out bombing activities around the National Day, he sneaked into Guangzhou and went to Shamian Island, Cultural Park, Southern Mansion, and other places to observe the terrain in preparation for distributing reactionary leaflets according to the instructions of the secret service agency. While he was carrying out these activities, he was arrested by the public security organs in accordance with the law after being reported by the masses.

　　Wu Man'an and Mai Zhong, who were sentenced to death, were both secret agents dispatched by the Hong Kong Chiang Kai-shek gang's "National Security Bureau Intelligence Bureau." In October 1956, while the Chiang Kai-shek gang secret service agencies were creating the Kowloon riot, they also attempted to create large-scale riots in Guangzhou and other places, dispatching them to Guangdong to bomb the Guangzhou Bund Theatre and the Foshan Railway Station, respectively. After receiving secret service funds and time bombs, they sneaked into Guangzhou and actively prepared to carry out bombing activities. However, their crimes were discovered and reported by the masses, and the public security organs, after careful investigation, arrested them according to law.

　　The other three secret agents, Zeng Chinan, Zhu Mao, and Liang Yichang, who were sentenced to death by the Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate People's Court, were sent by the Hong Kong Chiang Kai-shek gang secret service agencies in March and April of this year to Guangzhou to carry out heinous activities such as poisoning, assassination, arson, bombing, developing secret service organizations, and collecting intelligence. Secret agent Zeng Chinan sneaked into Guangzhou from Hong Kong on March 16th this year and tried to recruit his relatives and old friends to join the secret service organization, but was refused. He also secretly went to the Wuxianmen Power Plant, Xicun Power Plant, Water Plant, Overseas Chinese Sugar Factory, and other places to scout the terrain, plotting to carry out bombing and arson. After being arrested, this secret agent confessed to the aforementioned crimes and admitted that he had sent more than 20 secret letters to the Hong Kong Chiang Kai-shek gang secret service agency in just over a month after arriving in Guangzhou, asking the secret service agency to send him explosives and equipment. He also confessed that he was a perpetrator of the Kowloon riot instigated by the Chiang Kai-shek gang and was valued by the Hong Kong Chiang Kai-shek gang secret service agency, being appointed as the "leader of the Guangdong Second Action Group." Secret agent Zhu Mao had twice accepted the task of developing secret service organizations and sneaked into Guangzhou last year, but failed to achieve his goals. In March of this year, he sneaked into Guangzhou again to carry out sabotage activities. Secret agent Liang Yichang sneaked into Guangzhou from Hong Kong in April of this year and actively developed secret service organizations, going to public places such as Yuexiu Mountain and Cultural Park to find bombing targets, attempting to carry out sabotage activities.

　　The secret agent Huang Lixing, who was sentenced to death by the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court, joined the Chiang Kai-shek gang's "Intelligence Bureau Yue Nan Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" secret service organization in Taiwan in 1952. On October 19, 1956, the Chiang Kai-shek gang used an airplane to airdrop him near Nale Township, Fangcheng County, Hepu Prefecture, plotting to carry out armed rebellion. The four secret agents who landed with Huang were successively surrounded, captured, and killed by the garrison and militiamen. Huang Lixing escaped and fled to the border between China and Vietnam and was arrested on December 10th last year.

　　The other secret agent, Cai Bingsen, who was sentenced to death, was dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek gang's "Central Committee" in December of last year and sneaked back from Hong Kong to his native Rongshuxia Village, Lingshan Township, Dongguan County, to wait for an opportunity to carry out activities. After returning to his hometown, Cai harbored great hatred for the village cadres who had struggled against his landlord father during the land reform. He secretly sharpened two pointed knives at home, preparing to kill his cousin Cai Baiying and his wife, who had struggled against his landlord father, and then flee back to Hong Kong. This secret agent's conspiracy was thwarted, and he was arrested according to law, and secret writing medicine and other incriminating evidence were found on the spot.

    对敌人必须专政到底
　　广东枪毙九名蒋帮特务
    新华社广州3日电　广东省高级人民法院、广州市中级人民法院8月28日分别将九名蒋帮特务分子判处死刑。
    这九名特务分子是：李子杰、邓广林、吴满安、麦忠、曾炽南、朱茂、梁乙长、黄理兴和蔡炳森。这些特务分子除黄理兴是空投特务外，其余都是由香港和澳门蒋帮特务机关派遣到广东地区进行暗杀、纵火、爆破、放毒、散发反动传单等各种破坏活动的。他们的阴谋活动没有得逞，就被我公安机关在广大群众的协助下破获了。
    由广州市中级人民法院依法判处死刑的特务分子李子杰、邓广林，是由香港蒋帮特务机关在去年9、10月间派遣到广州进行爆破等活动的凶犯。去年蒋帮特务机关拟订了爆破和所谓“心理作战”的行动计划，阴谋在我国庆节前后在广州市进行一次大规模的爆破、纵火和骚乱活动，以支援右派分子向党和人民政府的猖狂进攻。特务机关这次阴谋爆破的目标有工厂、仓库、机关、码头、公园、影戏院和公共汽车等数十处，并阴谋在进行爆破的同时，在公共场所散发反动传单。特务分子李子杰1957年9月在香港参加蒋帮“国家安全局情报局”特务组织，特务机关对他进行了爆破训练后，规定他潜回广州爆破沙面的桥梁、长堤、青年会门口和广东省工会联合会大厦。李犯在去年10月23日潜入广州后，第二天就前往上述地点观察地形，并确定在10月26日或27日晚上爆破省工会联合会大厦。他打算在动手之前先买好回香港的火车票，在完成爆破后立即逃回香港。但当他正在进行这些罪恶活动的时候，就被我公安机关在群众的协助下捕获，并缴获炸药、雷管等罪证。特务分子邓广林1955年在香港参加蒋帮“中委会”特务组织，被委任为在港“交通联络员”。1956年曾潜入广州进行过特务活动。1957年9月，他接受散发反动传单、了解其他特务分子在我国庆节前后进行爆破活动的情况等任务潜来广州后，就按照特务机关的指示到沙面、文化公园、南方大厦等地方观察地形，准备散发反动传单。当他正在进行这些活动的时候，就在群众的检举下被公安机关依法逮捕。
    被判处死刑的吴满安、麦忠，都是香港蒋帮“国家安全局情报局”派遣的特务分子。1956年10月，蒋帮特务机关在制造九龙暴乱事件的同时，还企图在广州等地制造大规模的暴乱，派遣他们到广东分别爆破广州长堤戏院和佛山火车站。他们领取了特务经费和定时炸弹潜来广州后，积极准备进行爆破活动。但他们的罪行被群众发觉举报，公安机关经过缜密侦查后，就依法把他们逮捕。
    由广州市中级人民法院判处死刑的另三名特务分子曾炽南、朱茂、梁乙长，是香港蒋帮特务机关今年3、4月间派来广州进行放毒、暗杀、纵火、爆破、发展特务组织和收集情报等罪恶活动的。特务分子曾炽南在今年3月16日从香港潜来广州后，拉拢他的亲戚、旧友参加特务组织，都遭到拒绝，他又偷偷地跑到五仙门电厂、西村电厂、水厂、华侨糖厂等地方去看地形，阴谋进行爆破和纵火。这个特务分子在被捕后，对上述罪行供认不讳，并供认：他到广州一个多月，就连续向香港蒋帮特务机关发出了二十多封密写信，要特务机关给他送来炸药和器材，还供认：他是蒋帮集团策动的九龙暴乱事件的凶手，受到香港蒋帮集团特务机关的重视，被委任为“广东第二行动组组长”。特务分子朱茂，去年曾经两次接受发展特务组织等任务潜来广州，都没有达到目的；今年3月间他又潜来广州进行破坏活动。特务分子梁乙长今年4月从香港潜来广州后，积极发展特务组织，并到越秀山、文化公园等公共场所找爆破目标，企图进行破坏活动。
    由广东省高级人民法院判处死刑的特务分子黄理兴，1952年在台湾参加蒋帮“情报局粤南反共救国军”特务组织，1956年10月19日蒋帮用飞机把他空投到合浦专区防城县那勒乡附近，阴谋进行武装暴乱活动。同黄犯一齐降落的四个特务先后被驻军和民兵围捕击毙，黄理兴漏网逃到中越两国边境，在去年12月10日被逮捕。
    被判处死刑的另一个特务分子蔡炳森，去年12月间由蒋帮“中委会”派遣从香港潜回原籍东莞县岭山乡榕树下村伺机活动。蔡犯回乡后，对土改时曾经斗争他地主父亲的乡村干部怀着极大仇恨，偷偷地在家里磨好两把尖刀，准备杀死曾经斗争他地主父亲的堂兄蔡白英夫妇，然后逃回香港。这个特务分子的阴谋没有得逞，就被依法逮捕，并当场搜出密写药和其他罪证。
