Advance High Holding the Red Flag of the People's Commune

　　The People's Commune, marking a new stage in the socialist movement in our country's rural areas, is currently being rapidly established and developed in many places. The start of this movement was due to the spontaneous creation of the peasant masses on the basis of a high degree of socialist consciousness. After the success of a few of the earliest communes, many agricultural cooperatives learned from their example, gradually developing the movement. Now, with the advocacy of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the People's Commune movement has developed even more rapidly. Peasants in many places have written a large number of big-character posters, applications, and letters of determination, requesting the establishment of People's Communes. Henan and Liaoning have basically achieved province-wide communization. The People's Commune movement in Hebei, Heilongjiang, Anhui and other provinces is also in full swing. The provinces in the Northwest, the Yangtze River basin and the provinces south of the Yangtze River are preparing to establish communes in stages and batches after the autumn harvest. In places where People's Communes have already been established, peasants beat gongs and drums, rejoicing, and their enthusiasm for production is higher than in the previous stage. Poor and lower-middle peasants are even more overjoyed, believing that "years of hope have been realized today."
    The basic characteristics of the People's Commune are, first, large, and second, public, so the People's Commune can also be said to be a kind of large public society. The so-called large means that the scale of the commune is large, with many people and much land, which is convenient for carrying out large-scale comprehensive production and construction. Not only are agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries comprehensively developed, but also industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs are combined with each other. The People's Communes that have already been established are generally societies of ten thousand people or even ten thousand households, and the scope of a society is equal to a township (if the original township is too small, it can be expanded and merged). With more people and greater strength, many things that small societies could not do or were not easy to do in the past, such as medium-sized water conservancy projects, more complex industrial and mining construction, larger-scale road and housing construction, and the establishment of secondary and higher-level schools, can now be done on a large scale by large communes; the problem of labor shortage is also easier to solve. The so-called public means that the People's Commune is more socialist and more collectivized than agricultural production cooperatives. Because the scale of production of the commune is large, it requires higher efficiency in labor organization and more convenient free mobilization, and it requires all women laborers to participate in production, so organizations such as public canteens, nurseries, and sewing groups are becoming increasingly popular. In this way, some of the last vestiges of individual ownership of the means of production, which were still retained in the original agricultural production cooperatives, such as private plots, self-raised livestock, self-managed orchards, and some larger means of production, have been transferred to collective ownership in many places during the establishment of communes. A small number of communes have begun to implement public ownership of the means of production and are experimenting with wage systems or supply systems in distribution on the basis of mass consciousness and voluntariness. This experiment is beneficial because it points out the future of further development of production relations in rural areas. At the same time, since the People's Commune realizes the combination of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and goes beyond the scope of a single economic organization, becoming a unity of economy, culture, politics, and military affairs, the township-level government certainly has no need to exist separately and must be merged with the commune. The commune's administrative committee is the township people's committee. Furthermore, the county-level federation of People's Communes will also have a tendency to merge with the county people's committee. This is not only convenient for centralized and unified leadership, but also closely combines the collective economy of agricultural societies with the state-owned economy at the township and county levels, facilitating the transition from collective ownership to public ownership. Therefore, the People's Commune is the most appropriate organizational form for our country to accelerate socialist construction and transition to communism. As many outstanding utopian socialists until Marx, Engels, and Lenin have repeatedly predicted, it will develop into the basic unit of future communist society.
    The transformation from agricultural production cooperatives to People's Communes is an inevitable trend in the historical development of our country. There are currently about 700,000 agricultural production cooperatives in our country, most of which were established during the socialist upsurge in 1955 and gradually transformed into advanced cooperatives later. These advanced agricultural production cooperatives are undoubtedly much superior to individual households, mutual aid groups, and even elementary agricultural production cooperatives, and have played a great positive role in the year-by-year increase in agricultural production in our country over the past few years. However, with the development of agricultural production, especially the great leap forward in agriculture since last winter, these agricultural production cooperatives have gradually become unable to fully adapt to the needs of the development of the situation. On the one hand, the scale of these agricultural societies is relatively small, with an average of only more than 100 households per society nationwide, with little labor and a small amount of public accumulation, and the speed is slow. The development of diversified operations is also subject to various restrictions due to the small number of people, land, and strength. Many facts have proved that in order to develop agriculture at a high speed, in order to rapidly change the face of the countryside, in order to improve the living standards of peasants as soon as possible, it is necessary to carry out large-scale fundamental farmland capital construction to change the natural environment, it is necessary to take new agricultural technical measures, it is necessary to develop forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and sideline occupations while developing agriculture, it is necessary to establish industries that serve agriculture, serve rural life, and serve large industries, it is necessary to gradually realize mechanization and electrification, it is necessary to improve rural transportation and living conditions, and it is necessary to establish various education, health, and cultural undertakings. All of these are beyond the ability of an agricultural society with only dozens or hundreds of households. Before the establishment of the Chao Ying Commune in Shangcheng County, Henan Province, although the resource conditions were very good, the various small societies did not run many industries. After the merger of the societies and the transformation into communes, within ten days, 2,500 cadres and 17,500 members were drawn out to set up 4,530 factories for iron and steel, machinery, chemical fertilizers, cement, etc., of which 3,250 were put into production. The superiority of running large communes is clearly demonstrated here. In fact, in a series of struggles such as water conservancy, afforestation, drought resistance, and flood control since last winter, agricultural societies in many places have sharply felt that small societies are not as good as large societies, and that the original labor organization is not conducive to further tapping labor potential and improving labor efficiency. Therefore, many small societies have united, or broken through society boundaries, township boundaries, and even county boundaries and provincial boundaries, to carry out socialist large-scale cooperation, and have implemented a series of measures such as "military organization, combat action, and collective life." These situations show that agricultural production cooperatives with a relatively small organizational scale, relatively simple management projects, and a relatively low degree of collectivization have begun to become obstacles to the further development of productive forces.
    It must be pointed out that the rapid development of People's Communes among the peasant masses is by no means solely due to economic reasons. The enthusiasm shown by the peasant masses for the People's Communes first illustrates that the socialist consciousness and communist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants have been greatly improved. In 1957, the Party crushed the attacks of bourgeois rightists and landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, and defeated the capitalist tendencies of well-to-do middle peasants through the great debate on the two roads in rural areas. Subsequently, through the rectification movement, the relationship between cadres and the masses was fundamentally changed, and the right-leaning conservative views in agricultural production were overcome. In the process of this year's great leap forward in agricultural production and the entire rural work, the broad masses of peasants not only saw the agricultural production growing exponentially, but also saw the happy prospects of rural industrialization and urbanization. All of this has made the Party's prestige among the peasants unprecedentedly consolidated, and made the peasants unprecedentedly determined to rapidly build socialism and prepare conditions for the gradual transition to communism in the future. While striving to pursue the latest and highest development of production and construction and cultural education, the peasant masses are also striving to pursue new production relations and new organizational forms that are most suitable for the development needs of productive forces. Without this political consciousness as a foundation, the development of the People's Commune movement would be impossible and incomprehensible.
    The establishment of the People's Commune provides extremely favorable conditions for the further development of rural production relations. Since the expansion of the commune scale and the integration of township and society facilitate the rapid development of industrial, mining, transportation, and cultural and educational undertakings in rural areas, this makes it possible to gradually break down the boundaries between rural and urban areas, between peasants and workers, between peasants and intellectuals, and even between collective ownership and public ownership. However, in any case, the current People's Commune movement does not require that collective ownership be immediately transformed into public ownership, nor does it mean that it has been transformed from the primary stage of socialism, which is to each according to his ability and to each according to his work, to the advanced stage of socialism, which is to each according to his ability and to each according to his needs, that is, the communist stage. Some individual People's Communes may go further, but generally speaking, the transition from collective ownership to public ownership in rural areas will be a process that will be completed in three to four years or even five to six years. Then, after many years, social products will be extremely abundant, the communist ideological consciousness and moral qualities of the entire people will be greatly improved, universal education will be popularized and improved, and the differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor, which the old society left over and which socialism still has to preserve, will gradually disappear. The remnants of the unequal bourgeois rights that reflect these differences will also gradually disappear. The state's functions are only to deal with the invasion of external enemies, and have no effect internally. At this time, our society will enter the communist era of to each according to his ability and to each according to his needs.
    The current movement to establish People's Communes is developing into a mass movement that is even more powerful than the cooperativization movement in 1955. Party committees in various localities must make correct plans for the development of this movement and conduct active leadership in accordance with the specific circumstances of local work. The development of the People's Commune movement will inevitably vary from place to place, and there will be different characteristics in terms of scale, steps, and practices. Uniformity should not be forced. The establishment of People's Communes must be based on the genuine consciousness and voluntariness of the local masses through free airing of views, debates. As for any changes in the ownership of the means of production, especially, any impetuous, rash, or commandist attitudes are not allowed. In view of the particularly tense autumn field management work in many places and the need to arrange for production preparations for this winter and next spring as soon as possible, places that have already started or have not yet started to establish People's Communes must seize the current production work.

### 高举人民公社的红旗前进

　　高举人民公社的红旗前进
    标志着我国农村社会主义运动新阶段的人民公社，目前正在许多地方迅速地建立和发展起来。这个运动的开始，是出于农民群众在高度的社会主义觉悟的基础上的自动创造。在少数最早的公社获得成功以后，许多农业合作社就学习它们的榜样，使这个运动逐步地得到发展。现在，经过党中央和毛主席的倡导，人民公社的运动发展得更加迅速了。不少地方的农民群众写了大批的大字报、申请书和决心书，要求建立人民公社。河南和辽宁已经基本上实现了全省公社化。河北、黑龙江、安徽等省的人民公社运动也正在高潮中。西北各省、长江流域和长江以南各省，正在准备在秋收以后分期分批地建立公社。在已经建立人民公社的地方，农民群众敲锣打鼓，欢天喜地，生产积极性比前一个阶段更为高涨。贫农和下中农更是兴高采烈，认为“多年的盼望今天实现了”。
    人民公社的基本特点，一是大，二是公，所以人民公社也可以说是一种大公社。所谓大，就是公社的规模大，人多地多，便于进行大规模的综合性的生产建设。不仅农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展，而且工、农、商、学、兵互相结合。目前已经建立起来的人民公社，一般说是万人社以至万户社，一个社的范围等于一个乡（如果原有的乡太小还可以扩大合并）。人多力量大，过去小社办不到或者不容易办好的许多事情，例如中型水利工程、较复杂的工矿建设、较大规模的道路和住宅建设、中等和中等以上学校的兴办等，现在大公社都可以大办特办了；劳动力不足的问题也比较容易解决了。所谓公，就是人民公社比农业生产合作社更加社会主义化，更加集体化。由于公社的生产规模大，要求劳动组织有更高的效率和更便于自由调动，要求妇女劳动力全部参加生产，因而公共食堂、托儿所、缝纫组一类组织日见普及，这样，原来农业生产合作社中还保留的生产资料个体所有制的某些最后残余，如自留地、自养牲口、自营的成片果树、一部分较大型的生产工具等等，许多地方在建立公社过程中都已转为社有。有少数公社在群众自觉自愿的基础上，开始实行生产资料全民所有制，在分配上试行工资制或供给制。这种试验是有益的，因为它指出了农村中生产关系进一步发展的前途。同时，由于人民公社实现了工农商学兵的结合，超出了单一的经济组织的范畴，而成为经济、文化、政治、军事的统一体，乡一级的政权当然就没有单独存在的必要，必须同公社合而为一。公社的社务委员会，就是乡人民委员会。再进一步，人民公社的县联社也将有同县人民委员会合而为一的趋势。这样既便于集中统一的领导，又使得农业社的集体经济和乡级县级的国有经济得到了密切的结合，便利了集体所有制向全民所有制的过渡。因此，人民公社是我国加速社会主义建设和过渡到共产主义的最适当的组织形式，它将像从前许多卓越的空想社会主义者直到马克思、恩格斯、列宁所多次预料过的一样，发展为未来共产主义社会的基层单位。
    从农业生产合作社转变为人民公社，是我国历史发展的必然趋势，我国目前有七十万个左右的农业生产合作社，其中大多数是在1955年社会主义高潮中建立起来，并在以后逐步转为高级社的。这些高级农业生产合作社，毫无疑问比单干户、互助组以至初级农业生产合作社都优越得多，对于几年来我国农业生产的逐年上升起了伟大的积极作用。但是，随着农业生产的发展，特别是去冬以来农业的大跃进，这些农业生产合作社已经逐渐显得不能完全适应形势发展的需要了。一方面，这些农业社的规模比较狭小，全国平均每社只有一百多户，劳力少，公共积累数量少而且速度也慢，发展多种经营也因人少地小力量小而受到种种限制。许多事实证明，为了高速度发展农业，为了迅速改变农村面貌，为了尽快地提高农民的生活水平，必须进行大规模的根本改变自然面貌的农田基本建设，必须采取新的农业技术措施，必须在发展农业的同时发展林业、畜牧业、渔业和副业，必须兴办为农业服务、为农村生活服务以及为大工业服务的工业，必须逐步实现机械化和电气化，必须改进农村的交通运输和居住条件，必须兴办各种教育、卫生、文化事业。所有这些，都不是一个只有几十户、几百户的农业社力所能及的。河南商城县超英公社在公社成立之前，虽然资源条件很好，但各个小社办工业并不多。在并社、转公社以后，十天内就抽出了干部二千五百人和社员一万七千五百人，办起了钢铁、机械、化肥、水泥等工厂四千五百三十个，其中投入生产的三千二百五十个。办大公社的优越性，在这里就明显地表现出来了。事实上，在去冬以来的水利、造林、抗旱、防洪等一系列斗争中，许多地方的农业社已经尖锐地感到小社不如大社，感到原有的劳动组织不便于进一步挖掘劳动潜力，提高劳动效率，因而有许多小社已经联合起来，或者打破社界、乡界，以至县界、省界，进行社会主义大协作，并且实行了“组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化”的一系列措施。这些情况说明，原有的组织规模比较狭小、经营项目比较单纯、集体程度比较低的农业生产合作社，已经开始成为生产力进一步发展的障碍了。
    必须指出，人民公社在农民群众中这样迅速地发展，决不仅仅是由于经济的原因。农民群众对于人民公社所表现的热情，首先说明了广大农民的社会主义觉悟和共产主义觉悟有了极大的提高。1957年，党在农村中通过两条道路的大辩论，粉碎了资产阶级右派以及地主、富农、反革命分子的进攻，战胜了富裕中农的资本主义倾向，随后又通过整风运动，根本改变了干部和群众的关系，克服了在农业生产中的右倾保守观点。在今年的农业生产和整个农村工作的大跃进的过程中，广大农民不但看到了农业生产成倍地增长，而且看到了农村工业化、城市化的幸福前途。所有这一切，使党在农民中的威信空前巩固，使农民空前坚决地要求迅速建成社会主义，并且为将来逐步过渡到共产主义准备条件。农民群众在努力追求生产建设和文化教育的最新最高的发展同时，也努力追求最适合于生产力发展需要的新的生产关系，新的组织形式。没有这个政治觉悟作基础，人民公社运动的发展就是不可能的和不可理解的。
    人民公社的建立，对于农村生产关系的进一步向前发展，提供了极为有利的条件。公社规模的扩大和乡社合一，既然便于农村中的工矿交通事业和文教事业迅速发展，这就使打破农村和城市的界限、农民和工人的界限、农民和知识分子的界限以至集体所有制和全民所有制的界限逐步成为可能。但是，无论如何，目前的人民公社运动并不要求一律立即把集体所有制转变为全民所有制，更不表示它已经由各尽所能、按劳取酬的社会主义初级阶段转变为各尽所能、各取所需的社会主义高级阶段即共产主义阶段。某些个别的人民公社可能走得比较远些，但是一般说来，农村由集体所有制转到全民所有制将是经过三四年以至五六年才会完成的过程。然后再经过多少年，社会产品极大地丰富了，全体人民的共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质都极大地提高了，全民教育普及并且提高了，社会主义时期还不得不保存的旧社会遗留下来的工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，都逐步地消失了，反映这些差别的不平等的资产阶级法权的残余，也逐步地消失了，国家职能只是为了对付外部敌人的侵略，对内已经不起作用了，在这种时候，我国社会才会进入各尽所能、各取所需的共产主义时代。
    目前建立人民公社的运动正在发展成为一个比1955年的合作化运动更为声势浩大的群众运动。各地党委必须根据当地工作的具体情况，对这个运动的发展作出正确的规划，进行积极的领导。人民公社运动的发展在各个地方必然有先有后，在规模、步骤和作法上也会各有特点，不应强求一律。人民公社的建立必须是在当地群众通过鸣放辩论、真正自觉自愿的基础上。至于生产资料所有制方面的任何改变，尤其不允许采取任何急躁、轻率、命令主义的态度。鉴于目前许多地方秋田管理工作特别紧张，今冬明春的生产准备工作又需要及早安排，因此，不论已经开始或尚未开始建立人民公社的地方，都必须抓紧当前的生产工作。
