More than 3 million troops fight in continuous mountain ranges, and 45,000 indigenous furnaces stir up waves of steel.
Henan's Daily Output of Pig Iron Exceeds 18,000 Tons
Eight counties raise red flags for daily outputs exceeding 1,000 tons, and Yu County creates a new record of over 4,000 tons per day.

Our newspaper Zhengzhou, September 16th (reporter Lu Meiping): The people of Henan Province won a great victory on the iron and steel front on September 15th. On this day, the province's daily output of pig iron reached 18,693.92 tons, and also produced 10,250.18 tons of sintered iron. On this day, eight "satellite" counties with a daily output of over 1,000 tons of pig iron emerged in the province. Yu County was the highest, with a daily output of 4,396 tons of iron and 4,607.25 tons of sintered iron. The second highest was Lushan County, with a daily output of 2,154 tons of iron and 2,577 tons of sintered iron. The third highest was Baofeng County, with a daily output of 1,500 tons of iron and 2,500 tons of sintered iron. In addition, the daily output of Linru, Xinyang, Dengfeng, Shangcheng, and Bo'ai counties all exceeded 1,000 tons. The emergence of these large-scale high-yield satellites marks that Henan Province has broken through the barrier of mass production in steel production, and the province's steel production has entered a new stage of leap forward upon leap forward. (Note: Sintered iron refers to iron that has not been completely separated from slag, and its iron content is only about 70%. It needs to be re-smelted to become pig iron.)

On September 14th, the province only produced 3,362.11 tons of iron, and the number of iron-smelting furnaces put into production was only 13,964; but by the 15th, the number of furnaces put into production had surged to more than 45,000. On this day, the 3.6 million steel army densely spread over the Taihang Mountains, Funiu Mountains, Chaya Mountains, Tongbai Mountains, and Dabie Mountains appeared particularly busy. Some were continuing to mine ore, some were digging coal and coking, and some were guarding the fiercely burning iron-smelting furnaces. More than 400,700 various means of transportation in the province were transporting "supplies" to various iron-smelting furnaces. Whether it was cars on the main highways or rubber-wheeled carts, ox carts, and handcarts on the rural paths, they shuttled back and forth, ensuring that the ore and fuel needed for iron smelting were available at any time.

The prelude to the province's great release of iron "satellites" was opened by Lushan County. After this county released the first "satellite" with a daily output of 1,000 tons of iron on August 28th, the people of the province further broke the mysterious view of running the iron and steel industry. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on vigorously developing the iron and steel industry, promoted the experience of Lushan County's daily output of 1,000 tons of iron throughout the province; and issued a call to the entire party and people of Henan to "catch up with Lushan and surpass Lushan" so that the province would reach a daily output of 10,000 tons of iron on the 15th. From then on, all special districts, counties, communes, and iron-smelting furnaces specifically formulated their own goals, and competitions for the "satellite" red flag were carried out between regions, counties, communes, factories, and furnaces. At the same time, the Party committees at all levels in Henan Province took a series of measures aimed at the key points of steel production, widely organized communist cooperation; mobilized the masses to mine ore, dig coal, coke, and build bridges and roads; and organized various means of transportation to ensure that steel production was continuously supplied with food and supplies. From the province to the commune, steel headquarters were organized, headed by the first secretary of the Party committee, and Party committee members were assigned to different fronts or areas, going deep into the lower levels to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. In order to solve the technical problems of iron smelting, many provincial party secretaries, prefectural party secretaries, county party secretaries, township party secretaries, and factory party secretaries also established "secretary furnaces," "command furnaces," and high-yield steel "experimental fields," and many people worked alongside workers, sleeping next to the furnace to try out the "three togethers" and participate in iron smelting production. In order to win a great victory on the steel front, the five county party secretaries and seventeen county party committee members of Yu County went all out. They went to the four steel combat zones, commanding the 150,000 steel army day and night, launching a blitzkrieg on steel, solving problems in a timely manner, and spreading and summarizing experience. On the 10th of this month, the number of various iron-smelting furnaces put into production in the county was 270, which surged to 6,386 on the 15th. The Yu County Committee of the Communist Party of China also adopted the "seven determinations" measures of determining leadership, determining tasks, determining time, determining equipment, determining quality, determining labor, and determining safety. It also transferred 80% of the cadres directly under the county overnight to the mountains to strengthen the front line, implementing a full-time system of one cadre per furnace. In addition, 500 temporary workers were transferred from the basically completed Malou Reservoir and rushed to the Xinfeng Coal Mine to make coke overnight. At the same time, the masses were organized to burn charcoal and make their own coal balls. On the afternoon and evening of the 13th, the cadres directly under the county alone made 150,000 catties of coal balls. More than 10,000 tons of ore were newly mined by mobilizing 30,000 more troops. The more than 100,000 people on the front line worked hard for two days and nights, basically completing the main road leading to the main mining areas, and organized more than 7,000 various means of transportation to continuously transport ore and fuel. Now, the people of Yu County are making persistent efforts to advance towards the goal of a daily output of 5,000 tons of iron.

After Henan Province's large "satellite" with a daily output of more than 18,000 tons of iron went into the sky, it further boosted the morale of the masses. Through the release of "satellites," all localities mobilized various forces to twist them into one rope to serve steel production, so that the various links of steel production—ore mining, coal mining, coking, transportation, equipment supply—were connected with the needs of smelting. Many masses "suddenly became wise" and created many new iron-smelting methods. Leaders at all levels have also further gained experience in organizing steel production.

Now, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is taking measures to consolidate the results of this large-scale iron production in the province, so that after the province's daily output frequently reaches 20,000 tons, another steel production upsurge will be organized. To this end, the Provincial Party Committee has requested all localities to: 1. Further mobilize the masses to do a good job in political and ideological work and oppose relaxation; 2. Strengthen transportation and material supply work; 3. Determine the type of furnace and quickly promote the type of furnace that is simple to build, high in quality and output; 4. All people break through the technical barrier. The Provincial Party Committee also requires all localities to resolutely eliminate sintered iron and improve the quality of iron.

    三百多万大军奋战丛山峻岭　四万五千土炉翻起钢铁波涛
    河南日产生铁一万八千多吨
    八个县竖起日产千吨以上的红旗　禹县创造日产四千多吨新纪录
    本报郑州16日电　记者陆美萍报道：河南省人民9月15日在钢铁战线上打了一个大胜仗，这天全省日产生铁一万八千六百九十三点九二吨，另外还产了烧结铁一万零二百五十点一八吨。这一天，全省出现了八个日产生铁千吨以上的“卫星”县。其中以禹县为最高，日产铁四千三百九十六吨，外产烧结铁四千六百零七点二五吨。其次是鲁山县，日产铁二千一百五十四吨，外产烧结铁二千五百七十七吨。再次是宝丰县，日产铁一千五百吨，外产烧结铁二千五百吨。此外，临汝、信阳、登封、商城和博爱五县的日产量都在千吨以上。这些大面积高产卫星的出现，标志着河南省在钢铁生产上突破了大量生产这一关，使全省钢铁生产进入了跃进再跃进的新阶段。（按：烧结铁是指铁和渣质还没有完全分离的铁，含铁量只有70％左右，还要经过重新冶炼，才能成为生铁。）
    在9月14日这天，全省只产铁三千三百六十二点一一吨，投入生产的各种炼铁炉也仅有一万三千九百六十四座；可是到15日，投入生产的炉子就猛增到四万五千多座。这天密布在太行山、伏牛山、嵖岈山、桐柏山、大别山上的三百六十万钢铁大军显得格外忙碌。他们有的在继续采矿石，有的在挖煤炼焦，有的守在烈火熊熊的炼铁炉旁。全省出动的四十万零七千多辆各种运输工具，在向各个炼铁炉运送“粮饷”。不论在公路干线的汽车还是在乡间小道上的胶轮马车、牛车和架子车，来往穿梭不息，使炼铁用的矿石和燃料随要随有。
    全省大放出铁“卫星”的序幕是由鲁山县揭开的。这个县在8月28日放出了第一颗日产千吨铁的“卫星”后，使全省人民进一步打破了举办钢铁工业的神秘观点。中共河南省委为贯彻党中央和毛主席关于大办钢铁工业的指示，在全省推广了鲁山县日产千吨铁的经验；并且向河南全党全民发出了“赶鲁山，超鲁山”使全省在15日达到日产铁一万吨的号召。从此。各专、县、公社和各个炼铁炉都具体制订自己的奋斗目标，并且地区与地区、县与县、社与社、厂与厂、炉与炉之间开展了争夺“卫星”红旗的竞赛。同时中共河南省各级党委又针对着钢铁生产的几个关键，采取了一系列的措施，广泛地组织共产主义大协作；发动群众采矿石、挖煤，炼焦和修桥铺路；组织各种运输工具使钢铁生产作到粮饷不绝。从省一直到公社都组织了钢铁指挥部，由党委第一书记挂帅，党委委员分战线或分片包干，深入下层及时发现问题，及时解决。为解决炼铁的技术问题，许许多多的省委书记、地委书记、县委书记、乡党委书记和厂党委书记还建立了“书记炉”、“指挥炉”和钢铁高产“试验田”，并且有很多人和工人一起，睡在炉旁试行“三同”，参加炼铁生产。禹县为了在钢铁前线上打一个大胜仗，五位县委书记和十七位县委委员全力以赴，他们分赴四个钢铁作战区，日夜不停地指挥十五万钢铁大军，向钢铁开展了闪击战，及时解决问题，传播总结经验。本月10日，这个县投入生产的各种炼铁炉为二百七十个，到15日猛增到六千三百八十六个。中共禹县县委还采取了定领导、定任务、定时间、定设备、定质量、定劳力、定安全的“七定”措施，并且抽调了县直属机关80％的干部连夜上山，加强前线，实行一个干部包一个炉的专职。并且从基本完工的马楼水库抽调了五百临时工，星夜赶到新峰煤矿炼焦。同时，组织群众烧制木炭和自做煤球，仅县直属机关干部在13日下午和夜间，自做煤球十五万斤。还新动员三万大军开采了一万多吨矿石。前线十多万群众苦战两昼夜，基本修通了通往各主要矿区的公路干道，并组织各种运输工具七千多辆，川流不息地运送矿石和燃料。现在，禹县人民正在再接再厉向日产铁五千吨目标大举进军。
    河南省日产一万八千多吨铁的大“卫星”上天后，进一步鼓舞了广大群众的斗志。各地通过发放“卫星”，把各方面力量动员了起来拧成一股绳，为钢铁生产服务，从而使钢铁生产的几个环节——采矿、挖煤、炼焦、运输、设备供应同冶炼的需要得到互相衔接。许多群众“急中生智”，创造了不少新的炼铁方法。各级领导也进一步取得了组织钢铁生产的经验。
    现在，中共河南省委正在采取措施，巩固这次全省大面积出铁的成果，使全省日产量经常达到二万吨之后，再组织一次钢铁生产高潮。为此，省委已经要求各地：一、进一步发动群众作好政治思想工作，反对松懈；二、加强运输和物资供应工作；三、确定炉型，迅速推广产量高质量好建炉简便的炉型；四、全民突破技术关。省委还要求各地坚决消灭烧结铁，提高铁的质量。
