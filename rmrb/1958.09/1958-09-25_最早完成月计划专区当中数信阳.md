Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 24th. As of the 23rd, Xinyang Special Zone in Henan Province has produced 26,548.24 tons of iron, exceeding the September pig iron production leap forward plan by 2.92%. Now, the Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward new goals for the iron and steel army in the entire region: the September pig iron output should be doubled compared with the original plan, and at the end of the month, a large "satellite" with a daily output of 20,000 tons of pig iron should be launched as a gift to National Day.

Before September 15th, the cumulative output of pig iron in the Xinyang Special Zone was only 3,918 tons. After the 15th, the entire region's iron and steel production had a continuous leap forward. A total of 750,000 iron and steel soldiers were mobilized in the entire region, forming specialized teams for smelting, mining, iron sand panning, transportation, and coking and charcoal burning, with each link closely connected. At the same time, after each leap forward, the Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately convened a telephone conference of the first secretaries of the county committees to summarize and exchange experiences, and put forward new combat missions and specific measures. The county committees also made arrangements through battlefield meetings and mass meetings, and launched a debate on whether or not continuous leap forwards could be achieved and how to achieve them, in order to further mobilize the masses, boost their morale, and tap production potential. As a result, on the 21st, the daily output of pig iron in the entire region leaped forward to exceed 10,000 tons.

The Xinyang Special Zone is one of the regions with relatively poor iron and steel smelting conditions in Henan Province. The entire region is very short of coal, and it has been raining continuously recently. However, they relied on the masses to overcome these difficulties.

    最早完成月计划专区当中数信阳
    据新华社郑州24日电  河南省信阳专区到23日止，已产生铁两万六千五百四十八点二四吨，超额2.92％完成了9月份生铁生产跃进计划。现在，中共信阳地委又向全区钢铁大军提出了新的奋斗目标：9月份生铁产量要比原计划翻一番，并在月底放出日产生铁两万吨的大“卫星”，向国庆节献礼。
    在9月15日以前，信阳专区生铁的累计产量还只有三千九百一十八吨。15日以后，全区钢铁生产有了连续的跃进。全区共出动了七十五万钢铁大军，分别组成了冶炼、采矿、淘铁砂、运输和炼焦烧炭等专业队，各个环节做到相互衔接。同时，在每一次跃进之后，中共信阳地委立即召开各县委第一书记电话会议，总结交流经验，提出新的战斗任务和具体措施。各县委也随即通过战地会、群众会进行布置，并且以大鸣大放大辩论的形式，开展能不能连续跃进和如何跃进的论战，以此来进一步发动群众，鼓足干劲，挖掘生产潜力。因此，21日全区日产生铁跃进到超过万吨。
    信阳专区是河南省钢铁冶炼条件比较差的地区之一，全区的煤炭非常缺乏，最近又阴雨连绵。但是，他们依靠群众克服了这些困难。
