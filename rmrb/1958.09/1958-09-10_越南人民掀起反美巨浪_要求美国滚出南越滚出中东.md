Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 9th: For over a month since July 20th, the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords, a vigorous anti-American movement has unfolded throughout North Vietnam. From the Vinh Linh area north of the 17th parallel to the Sino-Vietnamese border, from the coast and plains to the mountains, a total of 2.25 million people have participated in anti-American rallies and demonstrations. They demanded that U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam, that U.S. and British troops get out of the Middle East, and that the South Vietnamese authorities implement disarmament, mutual trade, and the restoration of normal relations between the North and South, including normal postal relations.

"Turn hatred for imperialism into the drive to build a socialist North Vietnam" is a common slogan among the masses in this movement. Driven by this movement, socialist labor emulation drives in industrial and agricultural production are further developing, and the enthusiasm of students and cadres for participating in physical labor and the literacy campaign is increasing.

The Vietnamese People's Army stationed on the border and in various combat posts has also launched a widespread anti-American movement. They resolutely stated that they must constantly heighten their vigilance, be ready at any time to counter the provocative schemes of U.S. imperialism, build a powerful armed force to defend peace and defend the motherland, and actively participate in the socialist construction of the North.

During this period, 580,000 people signed petitions demanding that U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam and that U.S. and British troops get out of the Middle East. More than one million people watched films shown during the "Anti-American Film Week".

　　越南人民掀起反美巨浪
    要求美国滚出南越滚出中东
    新华社河内9日电　从今年7月20日日内瓦协议签订四周年开始的一个多月以来，整个越南北方展开了如火如荼的反美运动。从十七度线以北的永灵区到中越边界，从海岸、平原到山区，共有二百二十五万人参加了反美的集会和示威游行。他们要求美帝国主义滚出南越，要求美英军队滚出中东，要求南越当局实行裁军、互通贸易、恢复北南两地区的正常关系，包括正常的通邮关系。
    “把对帝国主义的仇恨化为建设社会主义北方的干劲”是人民群众在这个运动中的普遍口号。在这个运动的推动下，工农业生产竞赛正在进一步发展，学生、干部参加体力劳动和扫盲运动的热情日益高涨。
    驻守在边防和各战斗岗位上的越南人民军也展开了广泛的反美运动。他们坚决表示要时刻提高警惕、随时准备反击美帝国主义的挑衅阴谋，建设一支保卫和平、保卫祖国的强大武装力量，并且积极参加北方的社会主义建设。
    在这期间，有五十八万人签名要求美帝国主义滚出南越，并且要求美英军队滚出中东。有一百多万人观看了“反美电影周”中放映的影片。
