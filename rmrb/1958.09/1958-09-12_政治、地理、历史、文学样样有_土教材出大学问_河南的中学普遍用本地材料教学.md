Politics, Geography, History, and Literature – All Included
    Local Teaching Materials Lead to Great Knowledge
    Middle Schools in Henan Widely Use Local Materials for Teaching

(Reported by this newspaper) Middle schools and teacher training schools in Henan Province, in their teaching reforms, creatively utilize local teaching materials, which are welcomed by students and improve the quality of teaching.

In the process of teaching reform, schools above the middle school level in Henan Province attach great importance to the collection and use of local teaching materials, considering it an important method of linking theory with practice, cultivating students' love for the motherland, love for their hometowns, and familiarity with local "treasures." Each school has established "Local Teaching Material Collection Groups" according to subject. The scope of collection includes local folk tales, places of interest, poems and clappers, natural geography, historical evolution, folk mathematics, and physics; in conjunction with the current political struggles, there are comparisons of economic changes before and after liberation in a commune, a village, and a household, as well as concrete evidence of the crimes committed by the Kuomintang and Tang Enbo in Henan; to complement physics classes, they also interview tool innovators; the middle school in Changge County also studies and summarizes the county's deep plowing experience in conjunction with biology classes. In addition, many schools include the long-term plans of their county and township in political classes. All these local teaching materials are appropriately arranged and explained in various classes, allowing students to have concrete experiences and understanding of textbook knowledge. In many cases, teachers and students jointly conduct investigations and research in the countryside, such as changes in the economic life of the masses before and after liberation, which has a greater enlightening educational significance for students.

Many students have developed great interest in such investigations and research, forming habits. After returning to school after the holidays, they bring many meaningful and interesting local teaching materials. For example, they collect many such folk math problems: "A stake in the open field, a sheep tied to the stake, grazing on 3.2 mu of land, not knowing how long the rope is." Students love to calculate and find it easy to understand, sometimes even going home to teach the masses. Teachers and students of the agricultural technology class at Zhengzhou No. 7 Middle School compiled the collected agricultural proverbs into a book arranged by season and lectured on them in class. These concise and vivid agricultural proverbs are often a complete set of experiences and methods from plowing to harvesting for a certain crop. The earth-shaking agricultural tool reform movement currently underway in Henan has become good teaching material for physics classes in various schools. Many schools have already drawn the wisdom and creations of the masses into blueprints. Students of Changge No. 3 Middle School have imitated five new types of agricultural tools in conjunction with "peasant physics." A large number of beautiful folk tales, healthy and simple clapper poems, have enriched the writing content of students. Many schools have set off a creative upsurge of clapper poems.

Many junior high school students in some schools did not know what the "Tang" disaster referred to in the "water, drought, locust, and Tang" four major disasters in Henan before liberation. After the teacher explained it, they were surprised and asked: How could there be such a bad army? The teachers took them to investigate the victims together, and they received a deep class education. During the anti-rightist struggle, students of Changge No. 3 Middle School brought Zhang Dongfang, who had been ruined by Tang Enbo, to the school and reasoned with the rightists. The children of handicraft workers in Xinxiang City looked down on the occupations of their fathers and brothers, and also looked down on their future prospects. The teachers compiled a booklet called "The Manufacturing Process of Fifteen Kinds of Handicraft Products in Xinxiang City that Have Reached International Standards" as supplementary teaching material for technical classes. As a result, they learned technology and received education. The students said: Xinxiang's handicraft industry is not simple! They also have special respect for their fathers and brothers.

The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on the use of local teaching materials long ago. The instructions also require all schools to prevent the emergence of localism among students when using local teaching materials. Now Henan Province has established specialized organizations for collecting and researching local teaching materials.

    政治、地理、历史、文学样样有
    土教材出大学问
    河南的中学普遍用本地材料教学
    本报讯　河南省中等学校和师范学校，在教学改革中，创造性地运用了乡土教材，受到学生们的欢迎，提高了教学质量。
    河南省各中等以上的学校，在进行教学改革中，非常重视乡土教材的搜集和运用，认为这是理论联系实际，培养学生热爱祖国、热爱家乡、熟悉乡土“财宝”的重要方法之一。各学校都按照科别成立了“乡土教材搜集小组”。搜集范围包括有本地区的民间传说、名胜古迹、诗歌快板、自然地理、历史沿革、民间数学和物理学等；结合当前政治斗争的有一社一村一户解放前后的经济变化对比，国民党、汤恩伯在河南的罪行实证；配合物理课，还访问工具革新者；长葛县的中学还配合生物课学习总结这个县深翻土地的经验。此外，许多学校还把本县本乡的远景规划列入政治课。以上这些乡土教材，都被适当地安排在各课中讲解，使学生对书本知识有了具体的体会和理解。在很多情况下，都是师生共同下乡进行调查和研究，如群众解放前后经济生活的变化等，对学生的启发教育意义更大。
    很多学生对这样的调查研究发生了极大的兴趣，养成了习惯，假期过后回到学校，都带来许多有意义的和有趣的乡土教材。比如他们搜集许多这一类的民间数学题：旷野一根桩，桩上系一羊，踏地三亩二，不知羊绳长。学生爱算也容易理解，有时还回家教群众。郑州七中农业技术课的师生把搜集的农谚按季节顺序编成书在课堂上讲。这些简练而又形象化的农谚，很多是某一种作物从翻地到收获的全套经验和办法。河南目前正在进行的翻天复地的农具改革运动，成了各校物理课的好教材。许多学校，已经把群众的智慧创造绘成图纸。长葛三中的学生结合着“农民物理学”仿制了五种新式农具。大量的优美的民间传说，健康淳朴的快板诗歌，丰富了学生的写作内容。许多学校掀起快板诗歌的创作热潮。
    不少学校的初中学生，不知道解放前河南“水旱蝗汤”四大灾害的“汤”害指的是什么？教员讲过后，还惊讶的问：怎么会有这么坏的军队？教员带他们一起向受害户进行调查，受到很深的阶级教育。长葛三中的学生，在反右派斗争中，把他们访问过的被汤恩伯弄得家破人亡的张东方背到学校，和右派分子进行说理斗争。新乡市手工业子弟中学，瞧不起自己父兄的职业，也瞧不起自己的将来前途，教员们编了“新乡市十五种达到国际水平的手工业产品的制造过程”的小册子，作为技术课的补充教材，结果，学了技术，受了教育，学生说：新乡的手工业可不简单啊！对自己的父兄也特别尊敬了。
    中共河南省委关于采用乡土教材早就有过指示。指示还要求各校在运用土教材时，防止在学生中可能产生的地方主义观点。现在河南省已经成立了专门搜集和研究乡土教材的组织机构。
