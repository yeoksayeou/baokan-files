Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, August 31st: Ottawa dispatch: Canadian Foreign Minister Smith stated in the House of Commons on the 30th, while answering questions from opposition leader Pearson regarding the tense situation created by the United States in the Taiwan region, that the Canadian government has brought to the attention of the United States government that Canada will not be drawn into any trouble that may occur in the Taiwan region.

Certain Canadian newspapers have harshly criticized the U.S. policy of aggression against China's territory of Taiwan, thereby creating tension in the region.

The "Globe and Mail" demanded that the United States abandon the absurd claim that the Chiang Kai-shek clique represents China, warning that as long as Taiwan remains in the hands of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, it will pose a great danger to the cause of peace.

The Canadian business newspaper "Financial Post" recalled that many of China's coastal islands are occupied by Chiang Kai-shek elements and have been turned into military bases under U.S. orders. The newspaper believes that these U.S. plans are absurd. It emphasized that the People's Republic of China is now taking measures to eliminate this danger "at its own doorstep."

The "Financial Post" condemned the U.S. policy of aggression, pointing out that no one has given the United States the power to "manipulate other worlds." The newspaper sarcastically said: "Uncle Sam's nose is too long, which may cause him damage."

Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, August 30th: Ottawa dispatch: Canadian Foreign Minister Smith, when discussing the tense situation created by the United States in the Taiwan region in the House of Commons on the 25th, assured the House of Commons that the Canadian government "has not undertaken any obligation" to "involve itself" in a war in this region.

Canadian Liberal Party leader and former Foreign Minister Pearson previously expressed the same view, saying that "the attitude that Canada should take" is not to get involved in this situation.

　　美国在远东玩火  加拿大不愿奉陪
　　加外长说已经提请美国注意
    新华社31日讯　渥太华消息：加拿大外交部长史密斯30日在众议院回答反对党领袖皮尔逊就美国在台湾地区制造的紧张局势提出的问题时说，加拿大政府已经提请美国政府注意，加拿大将不会卷入在台湾地区可能发生的麻烦中。
    某些加拿大报纸严厉抨击美国侵略中国领土台湾、从而在这个地区造成紧张局势的政策。
    “环球邮报”要求美国放弃蒋介石集团代表中国这种荒唐主张，它警告说，台湾一天在蒋介石集团的手中，它就一天对和平事业造成很大危险。
    加拿大商界报纸“财政邮报”追述说，很多中国的沿海岛屿被蒋介石分子盘踞，并且根据美国的命令变成了军事基地。美国打算利用这些岛屿作为进攻中华人民共和国的跳板。报纸认为美国的这些计划是荒唐的。它强调指出，中华人民共和国现在正在采取措施来消除这个“在自己家门口”的危险。
    “财政邮报”谴责美国的侵略政策，它指出，任何人也没有给美国“操纵其他世界”的权力。报纸讥讽地说：“山姆叔叔的鼻子太长了，这可能给他带来损害。”
    新华社30日讯　渥太华消息：加拿大外交部长史密斯25日在众议院谈到美国在台湾地区制造的紧张局势时向众议院保证说，加拿大政府“没有承担使自己卷入”这个地区的一场战争中去的“任何义务”。
    加拿大自由党领袖、前外交部长皮尔逊在这以前表示了同样的观点，他说，“加拿大应采取的态度”是不卷入这种局势之中。
