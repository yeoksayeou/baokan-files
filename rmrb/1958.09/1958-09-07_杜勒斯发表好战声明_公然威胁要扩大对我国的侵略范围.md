Xinhua News Agency, September 6th:

　　U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, after meeting with U.S. President Eisenhower in Newport, Rhode Island on September 4, and with Eisenhower's authorization, issued a statement that openly threatened to expand the scope of aggression against our country in the Taiwan Strait area, conduct war provocations, thereby intensifying the tension in the region, and seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　I have carefully studied with the President the serious situation created by the aggressive military actions of the Chinese Communists in the Taiwan (Formosa) Strait area.

　　The President has authorized me to issue the following statement.

　　1. Taiwan (Formosa) and the islands of Jinmen and Mazu have never been under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Communists. Since the end of World War II—for a period of more than thirteen years—they have been under the jurisdiction of Free China, namely, the Republic of China.

　　2. The United States has treaty obligations to help defend Taiwan (Formosa) against armed attack, and a joint resolution of Congress authorizes the President to use the armed forces of the United States to secure and protect relevant positions such as Jinmen and Mazu.

　　3. Any attempt by the Chinese Communists to seize these positions, or any of them, would be a blatant violation of the principle that underlies world order: that no country should use armed force to seize new territory.

　　4. The Chinese Communists have been heavily shelling Jinmen for about two weeks, and they have been using artillery fire and small naval vessels to disrupt the normal supply of approximately 125,000 military personnel and civilians on the Jinmen Islands. The official radio station in Beijing has repeatedly announced that the purpose of these military actions is to seize Taiwan (Formosa) by armed force, as well as Jinmen and Mazu. In almost every broadcast from Beijing, Taiwan (Formosa) and the coastal islands are linked together as the targets of the so-called Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　5. However, regardless of what the Chinese Communists say and have done so far, it is not certain that their aim is in fact to use all their strength to conquer Taiwan and the coastal islands by force. Nor is it evident that such an effort, as is now underway or may be undertaken, cannot be contained by the forces of the Republic of China, with the substantial logistical support that the United States is providing, in a heroic and purely defensive effort.

　　6. The joint resolution of Congress mentioned above determines that "the firm control by friendly governments of the island chain in the Western Pacific (of which Formosa is a part) is of vital importance to the vital interests of the United States and all friendly countries in the Pacific and along the Pacific coast." This resolution also authorizes the President to use not only the United States Armed Forces to protect Formosa, but also to "secure and protect such related positions and territories in the area now in friendly hands as he deems necessary or appropriate to guarantee the defense of Formosa, and to take such other measures as he deems necessary or appropriate to guarantee the defense of Formosa." In view of the situation described in the preceding paragraph, the President has not, pursuant to that resolution, determined that the use of United States Armed Forces is necessary or appropriate to guarantee the defense of Formosa. But if the President determines that it is necessary according to the circumstances in order to accomplish the purposes of the joint resolution, the President will not hesitate to make such a determination. In this regard, we have recognized that securing and protecting Jinmen and Mazu has become increasingly related to the defense of Taiwan. Indeed, the Chinese Communists also recognize this. The United States has made military deployments to take both timely and effective action once the President makes a decision.

　　7. The President and I sincerely hope that the Chinese Communist regime will not, as it did in Korea, disregard the basic principle upon which world order depends, that armed force should not be used to achieve territorial ambitions. Any such blatant use of force would raise an issue far beyond the security of the coastal islands, even far beyond the security of Taiwan (Formosa). It would foreshadow the widespread use of force in the Far East, thereby endangering the vital positions of the free world and the security of the United States. Tacit acceptance of this situation would threaten peace everywhere. We believe that the family of civilized nations will never condone open military conquest as a legitimate policy tool.

　　8. However, the United States has not given up hope that Beijing will not disregard the desire of mankind for peace. This does not require it to abandon its demands, no matter how unfounded we believe these demands to be. I recall that during the long-lasting negotiations between the representatives of the United States and the Chinese Communist regime in Geneva between 1955 and 1958, the United States made continuous efforts to obtain, particularly with regard to the Taiwan area, a declaration of common and mutual renunciation of the use of force except in self-defense, but this declaration would not hinder the pursuit of policies by peaceful means. The Chinese Communists refused to make any such declaration. However, we believe that such a course of action is the only civilized and acceptable procedure. As far as the United States is concerned, it intends to pursue this course of action, unless and until the actions of the Chinese Communists leave us with no other option but to stand up and defend the principles upheld by all peace-loving governments.

### 杜勒斯发表好战声明  公然威胁要扩大对我国的侵略范围

　　杜勒斯发表好战声明
　　公然威胁要扩大对我国的侵略范围
    新华社6日讯　美国国务卿杜勒斯9月4日在罗德岛新港同美国总统艾森豪威尔举行会谈以后，在艾森豪威尔授权之下，发表了一篇公然威胁要在台湾海峡地区扩大对我国的侵略范围、进行战争挑衅、从而加剧这个地区的紧张局势、严重地威胁远东和世界和平的声明，声明的全文如下：
    我已经同总统仔细地研究了由于中国共产党在台湾（福摩萨）海峡地区侵略性的军事行动所造成的严重局势。
    总统已授权我发表下述声明。
    一、台湾（福摩萨）和金门、马祖各岛从来没有处于中国共产党人的管辖之下。自从第二次世界大战结束以来——在十三年多的时期内——它们一直处于自由中国、即中华民国的管辖之下。
    二、美国负有条约义务来帮助保卫台湾（福摩萨）不受武装进攻，国会的联合决议授权总统使用美国的武装部队来确保和保护像金门和马祖等有关阵地。
    三、中国共产党人方面现在要夺取这些阵地或其中任何阵地的任何尝试，都将是粗暴地破坏作为世界秩序的基础的原则，即：任何国家不应使用武装力量来夺取新的领土。
    四、中国共产党人大约两周以来一直使金门受到猛烈炮轰，而且他们一直利用炮火和小型海军舰只来扰乱金门各岛共约十二万五千军民的正常供应。北平官方电台一再宣布这些军事行动的目的是要用武装力量攻取台湾（福摩萨），也要攻取金门和马祖。在差不多北平的每一次广播中，都把台湾（福摩萨）和沿海岛屿联系在一起作为所谓中国人民解放军的目标。
    五、但是，不管中国共产党人说什么和至今做了什么，还不能肯定，他们的目的事实上是要倾全力以武力征服台湾和沿海岛屿。也看不出，像现在正在进行的或者可能进行的这种努力，是中华民国部队，在像美国正在提供的那样大量后勤支持下，无法以英勇的和纯粹防御性的努力加以遏制的。
    六、上面提到的国会联合决议中判定，“由友好政府巩固地掌握西太平洋岛屿锁链（福摩萨就是其中一部分），对于美国以及太平洋中和太平洋沿岸一切友好国家的切身利益来说，是极其重要的”。这个决议还授权总统可以不仅用美国武装部队来保护福摩萨，而且可以用美国武装部队来“确保和保护他认为是保证保卫福摩萨所必需或适当的、现在在朋友手中的该地区有关阵地和领土，并且来采取他认为是保证保卫福摩萨所必需或适当的其他措施。”鉴于上面一段所说明的局势，总统还没有根据该决议判定使用美国武装部队是保证保卫福摩萨所必需或适当的。但是如果总统断定为了完成联合决议的宗旨按照情况有此必要，总统就会毫不犹豫作出这种判定。在这方面，我们已经认识到确保和保护金门和马祖已经同保卫台湾日益有关。实在说，中国共产党人也认识到这一点。美国已经作出军事部署，以便一旦总统作出决定时接着采取既及时又有效的行动。
    七、总统和我真诚地希望：中国共产党政权不会再像在朝鲜表现的那样蔑视作为世界秩序所依靠的基本原则，即不应当用武装力量来实现领土野心。任何这种赤裸裸地使用武力的行动将引起一个远远超过沿海岛屿、甚至远远超过台湾（福摩萨）安全的这些范围以外的问题。这将预示在远东广泛地使用武力，从而危及自由世界的极为重要的阵地和美国的安全。默然接受这种情况，就会威胁一切地方的和平。我们相信，文明世界大家庭决不会把公然的军事征服宽恕成为合法的政策工具。
    八、但是，美国并没有放弃希望：北平不至于蔑视人类要求和平的意愿。这并不要求它放弃它的要求，不管我们认为这些要求是多么缺乏根据。我回想到，在美国和中国共产党政权的代表在1955年到1958年之间在日内瓦进行的持续很久的谈判中，美国做了持续不断的努力，希望能够特别在台湾地区方面获得一项宣布除非在自卫的情况下共同和相互放弃使用武力的声明，但是，这项声明并不会妨碍以和平方法来奉行政策。中国共产党人拒绝发表任何这样的声明。但是，我们认为，这样一种行动方针是唯一文明和可以接受的程序。就美国来说，它打算奉行这项方针，除非和直到中国共产党人的行动使我们除了起来保卫一切爱好和平政府所信奉的原则以外别无其他办法。
