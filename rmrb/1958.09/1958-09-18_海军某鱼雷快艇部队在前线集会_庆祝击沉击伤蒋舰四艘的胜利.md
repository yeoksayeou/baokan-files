Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, September 17th. A naval torpedo boat unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front held a celebration rally on the 12th in a certain area of the front, warmly celebrating the brilliant victory of closely coordinating with artillery and gunboat units in the naval battles since August 23rd to punish the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops who have increased their forces on Kinmen, sinking and damaging four Chiang Kai-shek military warships.

At the meeting, many officers and soldiers who were not afraid of difficulties and bravely and tenaciously completed their tasks in the battle were rewarded. Among them, Machinist Yang Liezhang, Petty Officer Su Zhiming, and Captain Dong Fucai were awarded first-class merit citations for their outstanding achievements. Yang Liezhang carefully inspected the machine parts before the assault and promptly eliminated machine failures during the battle, effectively ensuring the boats' impact on the enemy ships and their smooth withdrawal from the battle. Petty Officer Su Zhiming was brave and composed in battle, reported enemy information in a timely manner, and bravely took the lead in critical situations.

Seven people, including Instructor Wu Xiaosi, were awarded second-class merit citations. In the naval battle on August 24, Wu Xiaosi bravely and calmly commanded the flotilla to quickly approach the enemy and achieved a major victory by sinking an enemy "Zhong"-class warship in one fell swoop. Squad Leader Li Zunlun quickly discovered the target in the battle and accurately reported the enemy ship's position and distance, which enabled the commander to correctly issue a disposal decision and severely hit the enemy. Thirty-four people, including gunner Wu Ruhu and torpedo man Hu Qingxin, were awarded third-class merit citations. The soldiers in the engine room of a certain boat tried their best to ensure the high-speed advance of the boats to severely attack the enemy, and thus won the collective second-class merit citation. In addition, two combat departments were awarded collective third-class merit citations for their contributions to the battle.

The celebration rally also summarized the combat experience of the previous stage. The representatives of the heroes unanimously stated in their speeches that they would maintain their honor, heighten their vigilance, and be ready to give the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops an even heavier blow at any time.
