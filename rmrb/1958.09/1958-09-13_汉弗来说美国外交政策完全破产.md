Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 12th: U.S. Democratic Senator Humphrey stated on the evening of the 10th that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles had adopted "a most terrible attitude of duplicity" on the Taiwan situation, which was "frivolous, dangerous, and unforgivable."

Humphrey admitted that the U.S. government had "virtually fallen into a predicament" on the Taiwan issue. He said this "certainly proves the government's foreign policy has completely failed." He said: "For the next two years, our president will still be the current president, because he was elected for a four-year term, but we don't need the current Secretary of State. Replacing him would at least reduce one trouble for us."

On the same evening, New York Governor (Democrat) Harriman, who is running for re-election, also attacked the U.S. Republican government's policy on the Taiwan issue at a campaign rally. He advocated that the Chiang troops should be withdrawn from "untenable and vulnerable positions (referring to the coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu)"; but on the other hand, he vigorously advocated that the United States should "defend" Taiwan.

    汉弗来说美国外交政策完全破产
    新华社12日讯  华盛顿消息：美国民主党参议员汉弗来10日晚上发表谈话，指责美国国务卿杜勒斯在台湾局势问题上采取了“一种最糟糕的口是心非的态度”，这种态度“是轻率的、危险的和不可宽恕的”。
    汉弗来承认，美国政府在台湾问题上“实际上已经陷入了困境”。他说，这“肯定地证明政府的外交政策已经完全破产”。他说：“今后两年，我们的总统还是现在的总统，因为他当选的任期是四年，但是我们不需要现在的国务卿。如果撤换他的话，至少将给我们减少一个麻烦”。
    同一天晚上，正在竞选连任州长的纽约州长（民主党）哈里曼也在一个竞选会上攻击美国共和党政府在台湾问题上的政策。他主张应该把蒋军从“守不住的易受打击的阵地（指金门、马祖等沿海岛屿）”撤退；但是另一方面他却极力鼓吹美国应“保卫”台湾。
