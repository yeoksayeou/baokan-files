Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th: Some American politicians and newspapers feel uneasy about the US government's adventurous activities in the Taiwan area. They disagree with the US government's provocations against China and fear that this will plunge the US into a war.

    The Election Committee of the Socialist Party of America opposes the US government's adventurous policy in the Far East. It sent a telegram to Eisenhower saying, "The presence of our troops on Chinese territory is a threat to world peace. We call for the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Jinmen and Mazu and the waters around these islands to prevent the United States and the entire world from being plunged into a third world war. We demand that the United States promise not to interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China."

    The "Americans for Democratic Action," composed of some prominent Democrats, also wrote to US President Eisenhower on the 5th, saying in the letter that the United States has no obligation to "defend" Jinmen and Mazu, and the American people will not agree to be drawn into a war over this issue. The letter pointed out that the US taking military action to keep Jinmen and Mazu under the "control" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique is actually an intervention in China's internal affairs, and this action will not be supported by any of the US's major allies.

    Democratic Senator Morse demanded on the evening of the 4th that the US Congress immediately convene a special session to stop Eisenhower and Dulles from adopting a "brink-of-war" foreign policy. He believes that the United States has no right to defend the Chinese Nationalists on islands like Jinmen and Mazu. He said, "If we (the United States) go to defend them, we will be denounced as an aggressor, and that is indeed the case."

    Democratic Senator Mansfield also worried on the 5th that the US's provocative actions in the Taiwan area would cause the danger of war. He asked the US government to "calmly" consider the issue and asked the government to consult with congressional leaders before making any decisions.

    Senator Humphrey said on the 2nd that if the US government wants to "defend" the coastal islands of China, it may involve the United States in a war, and "things like this are always a risk."

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to TASS, New York, 5th: American newspapers are commenting on the statement made by US Secretary of State Dulles and President Eisenhower on the 4th in Newport (Rhode Island) regarding the US plan to invade the People's Republic of China. The newspapers called this statement the "Dulles-Eisenhower Declaration," believing that this statement is a reprint in the Far East of the notorious "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine" formulated for the Near East in the past.

    While boasting about this declaration, the Associated Press emphasized on the 5th that the United States intends to use American armed forces in the coastal islands of China, if the President believes that doing so is "necessary" to defend the "security" of Taiwan. The "New York Times" quoted instructions from "senior government officials" regarding the implementation of the "Dulles-Eisenhower Declaration," implying that the US ruling group is planning to invade the territory of the People's Republic of China. The newspaper said that this "person" also said that under certain conditions "US troops may be ordered to bomb" the troops of the People's Republic of China gathered on the mainland.

    American newspapers are forced to admit that the US government's policy of aggression against the People's Republic of China is not supported by the people of all countries. "New York Herald Tribune" commentator Lippmann wrote that the US's armed interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China will be condemned at the United Nations General Assembly, where there are quite a few countries that oppose the United States on the China issue. … The United States should avoid the United Nations, because in dealing with China's policy, the United States is largely isolated.

　　害怕负侵略罪责　担心“盟国”不支持
    美国政界和舆论惊慌不安
    据新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国一些政界人士和报纸对美国政府在台湾地区的冒险活动感到不安。他们不同意美国政府对中国的挑衅，担心这会使美国陷入一场战争中。
    美国统一独立社会党竞选委员会反对美国政府在远东的冒险政策。它打电报给艾森豪威尔说，“我们的军队驻在中国领土上是对全世界和平的威胁。我们呼吁立即从金门和马祖以及这些岛屿四周的海面上撤出美国军队，以防止把美国和整个世界卷入第三次世界大战。我们要求美国答应不再干涉中华人民共和国的内政。”
    由一些著名的民主党人组成的“美国人民主行动协会”5日也写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，他们在信中说，美国没有义务去“保卫”金门和马祖，美国人不会同意为这个问题卷入战争。信中指出，美国采取军事行动来使金门和马祖继续处在蒋介石分子的“控制下”实际上是对中国内政的干涉，这个行动将得不到任何美国的主要盟国的支持。
    民主党参议员莫尔斯4日晚上要求美国国会立即召开特别会议，来制止艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯采取“战争边缘”的外交政策。他认为美国无权保卫像金门和马祖这些岛上的中国国民党人。他说，“如果我们（美国）去保卫他们，我们就会被斥为侵略国，而且事实也的确是这样。”
    民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德5日也担心美国在台湾地区的挑衅行动引起战争的危险，他要求美国政府“冷静”考虑问题，并且要求政府在作出任何决定前同国会领袖磋商。
    参议员汉弗来2日说，如果美国政府要“保卫”中国沿海岛屿，那就可能使美国卷入战争，而“像这样的事总是一种冒险”。
    据新华社6日讯　据塔斯社纽约5日讯：美国报纸纷纷评论美国国务卿杜勒斯和总统艾森豪威尔4日在新港（罗德岛）会谈后发表的关于美国侵略中华人民共和国计划的声明。各报把这个声明叫作“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔宣言”，认为这个声明是当年针对近东制定的臭名远扬的“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”在远东的再版。
    美联社5日在吹嘘这个宣言时特别强调指出，美国打算在中国沿海岛屿地区使用美国武装力量，如果总统认为这样做对保卫台湾的“安全”是“必须”的话。“纽约时报”引述“政府高级人士”关于实现“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔宣言”的指示时暗示，美国统治集团正在策划侵犯中华人民共和国领土的计划。报纸说，这位“人士”还说，在一定的条件下“美国军队可能奉命轰炸”中华人民共和国在大陆上集结的军队。
    美国报纸被迫承认，美国政府所奉行的侵略中华人民共和国的政策得不到各国人民的支持。“纽约先驱论坛报”评论员李普曼写道，美国对中华人民共和国内政的武装干涉，会在联合国大会上受到谴责，那里在中国问题上有相当多的国家反对美国。……美国应当避开联合国，因为在对待中国的政策方面，美国在很大程度上是孤立的。
