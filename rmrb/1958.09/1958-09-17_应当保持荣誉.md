Opinion Column:

    The Flying Pigeon brand bicycles produced by the Tianjin Bicycle Factory have always been well-known domestically and are popular with the masses. However, during the Great Leap Forward in production, we found that not only did the quality of Flying Pigeon bicycles fail to improve, but it actually declined somewhat. Many customers have already raised criticisms. Based on our inspection, the main shortcomings of Flying Pigeon bicycles currently are as follows:
    (1) The electroplating of the handlebars and wheel rims is poor, easily peeling off or blistering. (2) The frame welding is not strong, easily causing tube separation and weld cracking. (3) The front and rear of the bicycle frame are not straight, and the front and rear wheels do not run in a straight line, differing by as much as two inches, affecting the bicycle's smoothness. (4) The specifications of the parts are not uniform. The freewheel teeth and chain holes do not match. (5) The two sides of the handlebars are uneven in height. (6) The inspection of bicycles before leaving the factory is not strict, and parts are often missing.
    After we discovered the decline in the quality of Flying Pigeon bicycles, we sent letters and people to the Tianjin Bicycle Factory several times to suggest that they find ways to improve, but so far there has been no effect. We hope that the Tianjin Bicycle Factory will maintain the reputation of Flying Pigeon bicycles and quickly improve their quality.

    应当保持荣誉
    天津自行车厂出产的飞鸽牌自行车，在国内一向负有盛名，广大群众都愿意购买。但是在生产大跃进中，我们发现飞鸽牌自行车不但没有继续提高质量，反而质量有些下降。许多顾客已经提出批评。根据我们检查，飞鸽自行车目前主要有以下缺点。
    （一）车把和车圈的电镀不良，容易脱落或起泡。（二）车架子焊接不牢固，容易发生拔管和开焊的现象。（三）车身前后不直，前后轮不走一条直线，相差有二吋之多，影响自行车的轻快。（四）零件规格不统一。飞轮齿和练条的孔眼不相吻合。（五）车把两边高低不平。（六）出厂的自行车检查不严，常发生缺少零件的现象。
    我们发现飞鸽牌自行车质量下降以后，曾数次去信和派人到天津自行车厂建议他们设法改进，但是至今不见成效。我们希望天津自行车厂保持飞鸽牌自行车的名誉，赶快提高质量。
