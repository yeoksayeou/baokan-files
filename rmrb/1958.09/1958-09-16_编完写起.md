　　Editing Finished, Start Writing
　　Futile Babbling
　　Eisenhower delivered a verbose speech on television, originally intending to use his silver tongue to deceive the world. However, the result was the opposite, arousing strong condemnation from world public opinion.
　　The late American President Lincoln said: "You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time." But Eisenhower didn't even manage to fool all of the people even for a short time.

　　Face and Voice
　　An American newspaper, when publishing Eisenhower's television speech, gave it the title: "Eisenhower's Face—Dulles' Voice." Very vivid.
　　Since Dulles' warmongering voice is detestable, and if such a voice comes from Eisenhower's mouth, his visage will naturally not be able to feign kindness any better than Dulles' face.

　　The Numbers Haven't Been Calculated Correctly
　　U.S. Democratic Senator Mansfield said that if the United States were to provoke a war with China, "this would put the United States' 175 million people against a total of 800 million people in Russia and Communist China."
　　Mansfield's numbers haven't been calculated correctly. First, standing on the side of the 600 million Chinese people are not only the 200 million Soviet people. Second, among the 175 million Americans, only a very limited number support the American ruling clique's policy of being enemies with the Chinese people.

    徒然饶舌
    艾森豪威尔在电视中大放厥词，原想靠他三寸不烂之舌骗尽世人的耳目。但是结果是适得其反，引起了世界舆论的强烈斥责。
    美国已故总统林肯说过：你可以在所有的时间欺骗一部分人，或者在一时欺骗所有的人，但是你不能在所有的时间欺骗所有的人。但是艾森豪威尔连一时要欺骗所有的人都没有能办到。
    面孔和声音
    美国一家报纸在发表艾森豪威尔的电视演说时，冠以这样的标题：“艾森豪威尔的面孔—杜勒斯的声音”。甚为形象化。
    既然杜勒斯的好战声音是可厌的，而从艾森豪威尔的嘴里说出这样的声音来，他的尊容自然也不会比杜勒斯的面孔更能装得慈祥些。
    数目还没算对
    美国民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德说，如果美国要同中国挑起战争，“这将使美国的一亿七千五百万人民同俄国和共产党中国总共八亿人民为敌。”
    曼斯菲尔德的数目还没有算对。第一，站在六亿中国人民一边的，不仅有两亿的苏联人民。第二，一亿七千五百万美国人中间，支持美国统治集团和中国人民为敌的政策的有限得很。
