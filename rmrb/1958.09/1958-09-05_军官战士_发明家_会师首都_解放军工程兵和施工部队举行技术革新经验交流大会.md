　　Officer and Soldier "Inventors" Gather in the Capital
　　PLA Engineering Corps and Construction Units Hold Technical Innovation Experience Exchange Conference
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Engineering Corps and Construction Units Technical Innovation Experience Exchange Conference opened in Beijing on the 1st. The more than 400 officer and soldier "inventors" participating in the conference are the vanguards of the Engineering Corps and Construction Units in their great efforts in technical revolution.
    At the opening ceremony, General Su Yu, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Tan Zheng, Director of the General Political Department, and Senior General Gan Siqi, Deputy Director, delivered speeches, encouraging the Engineering Corps, Construction Units, and all officers and soldiers of the Liberation Army to, under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction, continue to go all out, aim high, thoroughly break down superstition, liberate their minds, further integrate with actual work tasks, boldly invent and create, and launch a vigorous mass movement of technical revolution throughout the army, and carry out a great competition to promote communist style.
    General Xu Decao, Deputy Commander of the Engineering Corps, outlined in his opening speech the achievements of the vigorous technical revolution movement carried out by the Engineering Corps. Inspired by the great leap forward in the socialist construction of the motherland, the heroes of the Engineering Corps, who bear the glorious task of building national defense and defending national defense, have seen an unprecedented situation of a great leap forward in construction and training, and have launched a wave of technical revolution. From generals to soldiers, from technicians to breeders and cooks, everyone is diligent in research and dares to think and act. According to incomplete statistics, so far, in the past four months, all officers and soldiers have put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals and inventions. These mass invention and creation achievements have rapidly transformed many construction units from manual labor to mechanization or semi-mechanization, enabling the construction units to complete more than twice their annual tasks in five months, greatly improving the quality of the projects, and saving the country more than 20 million yuan in wealth this year.
    Due to the great efforts in technical revolution, in the first half of this year, the national Engineering Corps also transferred more than 1,100 machines, more than 5.89 million pieces of engineering equipment, and more than 1,200 tons of steel, more than 500 tons of explosives, etc., to vigorously support local industrial and agricultural construction, and participated in more than 1 million voluntary labor days. Now, the Engineering Corps is also running iron smelting, copper smelting, cement burning, and tractor manufacturing industries on a large scale, on the one hand to meet construction needs, and on the other hand to support local construction.
    At the conference on the 1st, representatives from the brotherly units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China warmly congratulated the Engineering Corps and the Construction Units, and visited the various advanced machines and tools invented and created by the "native expert" soldiers, which were displayed in the Technical Innovation Exhibition Hall with more than 1,000 items.

　　军官战士“发明家”会师首都
　　解放军工程兵和施工部队举行技术革新经验交流大会
    新华社讯　中国人民解放军工程兵和施工部队技术革新经验交流大会，1日在北京开幕。参加大会的四百多名军官、战士“发明家”，是工程兵和施工部队大闹技术革命的尖兵。
    在大会开幕式上，中国人民解放军总参谋长粟裕大将，总政治部主任谭政大将、副主任甘泗淇上将分别讲了话，勉励工程兵及施工部队和解放军全体官兵们一道，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，彻底破除迷信，解放思想，进一步结合实际工作任务，大胆地发明创造，在全军掀起一个轰轰烈烈的大闹技术革命的热潮，开展一个发扬共产主义风格的大竞赛。
    工程兵副司令员徐德操将军在开幕词中概述了工程兵部队蓬勃开展的技术革命运动的成就。在祖国社会主义建设大跃进的鼓舞下，肩负着建设国防、保卫国防光荣任务的工程兵英雄们，出现一个规模空前的施工、训练大跃进的形势，掀起技术革命的浪潮。从将军到士兵，从技术员到饲养员和炊事员，人人勤苦钻研，敢想敢干。据不完全统计，到目前为止，四个月来，全体官兵提出数以万计的合理化建议和发明创造。这一群众性的发明创造成果，迅速地使许多地区的施工部队从手工作业变成机械化或半机械化，使施工部队五个月就完成了全年任务的两倍多，工程质量也大大提高，并且今年将为国家节约两千多万元的财富。
    由于大闹技术革命，全国工程兵部队在今年上半年还抽调出一千一百多台机械、五百八十九万多件工程器材和一千二百多吨钢材、五百多吨炸药等，大力支援了地方的工、农业建设，并参加了一百多万个义务劳动日。现在，工程兵部队又在大办炼钢、炼铜、烧水泥和制造拖拉机等工业，一方面满足施工的需要，一方面支援地方建设。
    在1日的大会上，中国人民解放军驻京各兄弟部队和中共北京市委的代表，热烈地向工程兵部队及施工部队表示祝贺，并且参观了技术革新展览馆里陈列着的一千多件战士“土专家”发明创造的各种先进机械和工具。
