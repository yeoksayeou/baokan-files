Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 15th: The "Akahata" newspaper, in commenting on the results of the talks between Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama and U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, emphasized that Fujiyama agreed with the United States' absurd claims, insisting that China was making the situation in the Taiwan region tense. The newspaper wrote that Fujiyama's doing so showed the Japanese government's hostility towards China, thereby further worsening Sino-Japanese relations.

The newspaper then wrote that it could be seen from the course of the talks and the statements issued that the talks between Fujiyama and Dulles basically did not touch upon the fundamental revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which puts Japan at risk of being dragged into war adventures launched by the United States in the Far East.

"Akahata" pointed out that the Japan-U.S. talks held in Washington this time did not involve issues of real concern to the Japanese people, such as easing tensions in the Far East, the United States not using bases in Japan to mobilize its armed forces in the Far East, and not storing nuclear weapons within Japan.

    “赤旗报”评日美会谈结果
    痛斥藤山敌视中国的态度
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社东京15日讯：“赤旗报”在评论日本外务相藤山爱一郎同美国国务卿杜勒斯会谈结果时强调指出，藤山同意了美国的谰言，硬说是中国使台湾地区局势紧张起来的。报纸写道，藤山这样做，就表明了日本政府对中国的敌意，从而进一步使日中关系恶化。
    报纸接着写道，从会谈过程和发表的声明中可以看出，藤山和杜勒斯的会谈，基本上没有谈到根本修改日美“安全条约”的问题，而这个条约使得日本有被拖入美国在远东发动的战争冒险中的危险。
    “赤旗报”指出，这次在华盛顿举行的日美会谈没有涉及日本人民真正关心的问题，如缓和远东紧张局势、美国不用日本的基地来调动它在远东的武装部队、不在日本境内储存核武器等。
