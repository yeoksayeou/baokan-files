Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 16th: The 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly opened in New York today.

America's policies of aggression and playing with fire have placed it in an unprecedentedly difficult and isolated position within the United Nations. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, at the swearing-in ceremony for the U.S. representatives attending the assembly on the 12th, exclaimed in alarm that the U.S. would face a "very fierce struggle" at this session, complaining that some of America's allies were "somewhat weary" of the struggle with the "Communist world," and clamoring that the U.S. must provide "stimulation, courage, and energy" to continue obstructing and disrupting the normal work of this assembly. An article in the American magazine "The Nation" on September 6th, after analyzing the voting situation in previous sessions of the General Assembly, stated, "The conclusion is obvious… the natural majority that supported American policy no longer exists. The U.S. will have to scramble to gather votes."

Although the provisional agenda of the General Assembly does not include an item on the Middle East issue, the consequences of the U.S. and British aggression in the Middle East have not been eliminated and have caused widespread unease. Therefore, it is expected that the General Assembly will once again hold a debate on the Middle East issue when discussing the report of United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld.

Among the seventy items on the provisional agenda of the General Assembly are the issues of disarmament and the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, which are of concern to people all over the world but have not been resolved due to the obstruction of countries such as the U.S. and Britain, as well as a series of other issues related to disarmament.

The provisional agenda also includes the issues of Algeria and Cyprus.

The provisional agenda also includes the issue of China's legitimate representation in the United Nations, raised by India. In addition, there are issues such as economic and technical assistance to underdeveloped countries.

On the issue of disarmament, according to the Soviet Union's proposal, the provisional agenda of the meeting includes the item "prohibition of the use of outer space for military purposes, removal of foreign military bases on the territory of other countries, and international cooperation in the study of outer space." The General Assembly will also pay close attention to the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests.

On the issue of China's representation, the United States intends to repeat its old tricks and ask the General Assembly to "postpone" discussion of this issue. The United States is exerting enormous pressure on countries that used to depend on it, demanding that they continue to support American policy. The notorious so-called "Committee of One Million" also distributed pamphlets to delegations before the meeting, maliciously slandering our country.

The provisional agenda of the meeting also includes the so-called "Hungarian question" raised by Australia at the instigation of the United States. Obviously, the United States instigated the raising of this issue in order to divert people's attention from its policies of aggression and provocation.

### 联合国大会开幕  美国自知愈益孤立　力图阻挠大会工作

    联合国大会开幕
    美国自知愈益孤立　力图阻挠大会工作
    据新华社16日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会第十三届会议今天在纽约开幕。
    美国的侵略和玩火政策使它在联合国处于空前困难和孤立的境地。美国国务卿杜勒斯12日在出席大会的美国代表的宣誓典礼上，惊呼美国在本届会议上将面临一场“非常激烈的斗争”，他抱怨美国的某些盟国对同“共产主义世界”之间的斗争“有些厌倦”，叫嚷美国必须提供“刺激、勇气和精力”来继续阻挠和破坏这一届大会的正常工作。美国“民族”周刊9月6日载文在分析了大会历届会议的表决情况以后说，“结论是明显的……支持美国政策的自然而然的多数不再存在。美国将不得不努力搜罗票数。”
    大会预定议程中虽然没有关于中东问题的项目，但是，由于美、英侵略中东的后果迟迟不能消除，引起了人们的普遍不安，因此，预料大会在讨论联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的报告时将再一次就中东问题展开辩论。
    在大会的七十项预定议程中，包括有全世界人民所关心、但由于美、英等国家的阻挠而一直未能得到解决的裁军问题和停止核武器试验问题，以及同裁军有关的其他一系列问题。
    预定议程中还包括有阿尔及利亚和塞浦路斯的问题。
    预定议程中也包括有印度提出的中国在联合国的合法代表权的问题。此外还有在经济和技术上援助不发达国家等问题。
    在裁军问题方面，根据苏联的建议，会议预定议程中列入了“禁止利用宇宙空间达到军事目的、撤除在别国领土上的外国军事基地和在研究宇宙空间方面实行国际合作”这个项目。大会还将密切注意停止核武器试验的问题。
    在中国代表权问题上，美国打算重施故伎，要大会“延期”讨论这个问题。美国正在对过去依附它的国家施加巨大压力，要它们继续支持美国的政策。臭名昭彰的所谓“百万人委员会”在会前还向各国代表团散发小册子，恶毒诬蔑我国。
    会议预定议程中还有在美国怂恿下由澳大利亚代表提出的所谓“匈牙利问题”。显然，美国唆使提出这个问题是为了转移人们对它的侵略和挑衅政策的注意。
