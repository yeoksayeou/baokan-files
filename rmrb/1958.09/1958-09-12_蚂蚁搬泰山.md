    Ants Moving Mount Tai
    The situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture across the country has brought new contradictions to the transportation industry: the volume of freight has increased sharply, but the transportation capacity is far from keeping up. Especially on the steel front, a large amount of transportation capacity is needed every day to transport ore, coke, pig iron, and metallurgical equipment. In some places, the situation of steel production is not good, and a very important reason is that transportation has not kept up.
    How to solve this contradiction? How can we catch up with the transportation capacity at the fastest speed?
    There is a struggle on this issue. Some people look upwards, reaching out to the state for investment and transportation tools, wanting to take an existing old road to solve the problem. In Changzhou, some people once planned to ask the state to invest hundreds of thousands of yuan to buy ten cars, eight ships, and build eight-ton wooden boats. They sent people all over Nanjing, Shanghai, and Beijing, but they didn't buy any of them; ordering from elsewhere was also a case of "distant water can't quench a fire." However, the goods at the station and wharf piled up more and more. The railway station had no choice but to send telegrams to several stations along the way, notifying them to stop transporting ore. Obviously, doing so would not only fail to promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, nor guarantee the completion of the 10.7 million tons of steel task, but would instead become a stumbling block to the development of the work. It seems that the old road that these people planned to take is now impassable.
    The increasing transportation pressure is forcing people to choose another road that is more difficult to walk, but can achieve immediate results. This road has now been opened in Changzhou, and it has quickly demonstrated its superiority. Based on the policy of the whole party and the whole people running transportation, they organized an "ants moving Mount Tai" movement. The city mobilized one-sixth of its population and organized an unprecedentedly large transportation army. In a few days, tens of thousands of tons of materials were moved away. They gave full play to the wisdom of the masses and made full use of all available folk transportation tools; even soap boxes and flour bags were mobilized. Moreover, thanks to everyone brainstorming ideas to reform transportation tools, heavy manual labor such as shoulder carrying was eliminated within a month.
    The "ants moving Mount Tai" movement launched in Changzhou has once again shown us that the potential of the masses is endless. A city of more than 200,000 people was able to mobilize 40,000 people to participate in transportation and undertake such a heavy transportation task. It seems that to reverse the current tight transportation situation, the way out is still in the "rural style," that is, to launch a mass movement of transportation. If all parts of the country, like Changzhou, launch a nationwide transportation movement of "ants moving Mount Tai," the transportation difficulties we are facing will surely be resolved quickly.

    蚂蚁搬泰山
    全国工农业大跃进的形势，给交通运输事业带来了新的矛盾：运量猛烈地增加，但运输能力远远赶不上去。特别是在钢铁战线上，每天都需要很大的运力来输送矿石、焦炭、生铁和冶金设备。有些地方钢铁生产的情况不好，很重要的一个原因是运输没有跟上去。
    怎样解决这个矛盾呢？怎样才能以最快的速度使运输能力跟上去呢？
    在这个问题上是有斗争的。有些人眼睛向上，伸手向国家要投资，要运输工具，想走一条现成的老路来解决问题。常州市就曾有人打算过：要求国家投资几十万元，买十辆汽车，八只轮船，造八吨木船。他们派人跑遍了南京、上海、北京，结果一样都没有买到；向别处订货，也是远水救不得近火。可是，车站、码头上的货物却越堆越多，火车站没办法，甚至打电报给沿途的几个站，通知停运矿石。很显然，这样做，不仅不能促进工农业生产大跃进，不能保证完成一千零七十万吨钢的任务，反而成了障碍工作发展的一块绊脚石。看来，这些人打算走的那条老路，现在是走不通了。
    愈来愈大的运输压力，逼得人们不得不另外选择一条走起来比较困难，然而却能马上收到实效的道路。这条路现在常州市已经走通了，而且很快就显示了它的优越性。他们根据全党全民办交通的方针，组织了一个蚂蚁搬泰山的运动。全市动员了六分之一的人，组织了一支空前庞大的运输大军。几天之内就把几万吨的物资搬运一空。他们充分发挥了群众的智慧，把一切可以利用的民间运输工具都充分利用了，甚至肥皂箱、面粉袋都被动员了出来。而且由于大家动脑筋想办法改革运输工具，一个月内就消灭了肩担人挑的重体力劳动。
    从常州市发动的这个蚂蚁搬泰山运动，使我们再一次看到群众的潜力是无穷无尽的，一个二十多万人的城市居然能动员四万人参加运输，担负了这样繁重的运输任务。看起来，要扭转当前运输紧张的状况，出路仍然在“农村作风”、即要搞一个交通运输的群众运动。如果全国各地都像常州市一样，来一个蚂蚁搬泰山全民办运输的运动，我们面临着的运输上的困难就一定能够很快地到得解决。
