Prospects for a Bumper Autumn Harvest
By our reporter Lù Xiàopíng

The moment I arrived at the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Xiping County, Henan, I was deeply drawn to the various crops here. The millet here grows as tall as a person, the stalks like bamboo poles, and the heavy ears of grain nod their heads, the cooperative members fearing they might break the stalks. Newly planted rice, sesame (a crop traditionally considered low-yielding), and various other crops are also growing exceptionally well. This scene of a bountiful autumn harvest encourages the cooperative members to continue their fight. Some crops, according to past practices, should have been left unattended long ago, but this year they are still intensifying management: some are weeding, some are applying top dressing, some are catching insects... These situations show that this agricultural cooperative, which launched a high-yield "satellite" of 7,320 jin per mu of wheat in the summer, wants to launch even more high-yield "satellites" in the fall.

Where are the girls?

At the edge of a sesame field, Cooperative Director Chen Yanli told us that the girls were inside topping the plants. But we could only hear their happy laughter and couldn't see them at all. When a girl stood on a clod of earth, tiptoed, and reached out to the tip of a branch to top a tall sesame plant, we could vaguely see a few of her fingertips. A photographer who came to visit hurriedly raised his camera, ready to press the shutter, but suddenly, the girl's hand was submerged in the crops again. This frustrated him greatly. In the end, he had no choice but to wait until the girls were close to the edge of the field, and he stood on high ground to take a photo that only showed the black tops of the girls' heads.

This sesame field is a trial plot cultivated jointly by Cooperative Director Chen Yanli and Party Branch Secretary Dai Shulin. On the sign they put up at the edge of the field, they wrote: "Strive for a yield of 4,000 jin per mu." In our impression, sesame has always been a low-yielding crop with yields of tens to a hundred jin per mu. Can it really yield that much, even if it grows well? But the Cooperative Director casually picked a sesame plant and counted 638 capsules on it. Based on the number of plants they planted, the yield target they set was still a bit conservative!

Are they grapes or sweet potatoes?

The Cooperative Director led us towards the sweet potato field. From afar, we saw rows of trellises supporting crops with large leaves and thick vines, resembling a beautiful vineyard. But the Cooperative Director told us that it was a sweet potato field striving for a yield of 600,000 jin per mu.

In this field, a group of male and female cooperative members were sweating profusely as they tended to the sweet potato trellises. The vines were growing so vigorously that some trellises had already collapsed under their weight, forcing them to repair them. Some vines had extended to the ground because the trellises could not support them, so they raised the trellises and re-arranged the vines on them. These sweet potatoes supported by trellises do not grow fibrous roots on the vines, making it easier to absorb air and sunlight, and the sweet potatoes grow particularly quickly, already cracking the soil surface. This field has been deeply plowed, and a large amount of soil and miscellaneous fertilizers have been applied in layers, so it appears higher than the surrounding land. In this fertile and loose soil, how could the sweet potatoes not grow abundantly?

Party Branch Secretary Dai Shulin, who was tending the sweet potatoes in this field with the cooperative members, told the reporter: This year, the yield target for sweet potatoes planted by the entire cooperative is over 100,000 jin per mu. At least 4,000 sweet potato seedlings are planted per mu. Even Chen Pangeng, the "conservative" who used to be most opposed to close planting and the application of more fertilizer, has also cultivated a sweet potato field with a yield of 250,000 jin per mu, using the method of cultivating trial plots in the cooperative.

The astonishment of guests from Jiangnan

We came back from the fields and walked to the front of the Cooperative Management Committee's office, when we suddenly noticed dozens of visitors gathered next to a two-mu rice field. They were from Changshu County, Jiangsu. These guests, who had just come from the "land of fish and rice," were captivated by the rice here. Some were counting the number of plants, some were counting the number of grains, and some were measuring the height. According to their calculations, there were more than 45,000 rice plants in this field, each plant had 20 stalks, and each spike had an average of 222 grains. It should yield at least 15,000 jin. After calculating the expected yield, they couldn't help but stick out their tongues and hurriedly asked Party Branch Secretary Dai Shulin to tell them about the rice management experience. Dai Shulin told them that this was the first time rice had been planted here, and the rice fields were originally all wasteland. This made them even more surprised.

In fact, this rice field was converted from a water pit, and the rice does not grow very well. If they had not come to this field themselves, we certainly wouldn't have led them here for a tour. The large area of rice that the Cooperative Director led us to see grew taller and denser than this. We casually picked a rice spike and counted 302 grains.

After seeing the cooperative's autumn crops, the Party Branch Secretary told us: If no unexpected disasters occur in the future, the unit area yield of autumn grain this year will not be calculated in thousands, but in tens of thousands. He said: With such high unit area yields, what do we need so much land for grain crops for? Here, the average land for grain crops is only 0.49 mu per person. In the past, because the unit area yield was not high, the state needed to supply a lot of grain; this summer, a bumper harvest was obtained, with an average yield of 1,800 jin per mu, and the cooperative sold more than 80,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Now, the cooperative members, seeing the even greater autumn harvest, have already begun to complain that the 0.49 mu of grain land is too much. They want to use some of the land to grow cash crops.

### 秋季大丰收的前景

　　秋季大丰收的前景
    本报记者　陆笑萍
    一到河南西平县和平农业社，我深深地被这里的各种庄稼吸引住了。在这里，谷子长的足有一人高，谷秆如同竹杆，谷穗在沉甸甸地晃动着脑袋，社员们惟恐它会把谷秆垂断。新种植的水稻、一向被人认为是低产作物的芝麻和其他的各种作物，也长得十分出奇。这一幅秋季大丰收的前景，在鼓舞着这个社的社员们继续战斗。有些作物按往年习惯，早就该挂锄了；可是今年他们仍在加紧管理：有的在拔草，有的在施追肥，有的在捕虫……。这些情况向人们显示着：这个在夏季放出亩产七千三百二十斤小麦丰产大“卫星”的农业社，还想在秋季放出更多的丰产“卫星”。
    姑娘们在哪里？
    在一块芝麻地头，社长陈炎理对我们说，姑娘正在里面打顶。可是我们只听那欢乐的笑声，却怎么也看不见她们。当一位姑娘站在一个土块上，垫起脚跟，手伸向枝梢给一棵高大的芝麻打去顶时，我们才隐约地看到她的几个尖指头。一道来参观的摄影记者便急忙举起相机，正准备撩动快门，突然，姑娘的那只手又被庄稼淹没了。这使他大伤脑筋。最后没有办法，只好等到姑娘们靠近地边了，他站在高处，才照了一张只能显出姑娘们那黑色头顶的照片。
    这块芝麻地是社长陈炎理和党支部书记戴树林共同搞的试验田。他们在地头上插着的牌子上写着：争取亩产四千斤。在我们的印象里，芝麻一向是亩产几十斤到一百来斤的低产作物，长的再好，能收这么多吗？可是社长随便拣了棵芝麻一数，上面有六百三十八个蒴，根据他们种植的棵数一计算，他们订的产量指标还有点保守哩！
    是葡萄还是红薯？
    社长领着我们向红薯地走去。远远地，看到一排排架子上架着的作物叶大藤粗，很像一座美丽的葡萄园。可是社长却告诉我们说，那是一块争取亩产六十万斤的红薯地。
    在这块地里，一群男女社员个个汗流满面地收拾着红薯架。薯秧长的太旺了，有的架子已经被它压塌了，迫使他们在这里修理；有的薯秧因架子驮不住它了，伸到了地上，于是他们就将架子接高，把薯秧重新理到上面。这种被架着的红薯，藤上不生须根不跑劲，易于吸收空气和阳光，红薯生长得特别快，已经把地皮顶裂了缝。这块地是深翻了的，同时把大量的土、杂肥分层施到地里，所以显得比周围的地高。在这种肥沃松弛的土壤里，红薯又怎么能长得不多呢？
    同社员们一起在这块地里管理红薯的党支部书记戴树林告诉记者：今年全社种植的红薯亩产指标都在十万斤以上。每亩地栽的红薯至少是四千多棵。连往年最反对密植、多施肥料的“保守派”陈盘根，他也按社里搞试验田的办法，在那里培植了一块亩产二十五万斤的红薯地。
    江南客人的惊异
    我们从地里回来，走到社管理委员会的门前，忽然发现对面的一块二亩多的水稻旁边，集结着几十名参观者，他们是来自江苏常熟县。这些刚从“鱼米之乡”来的客人，看见这里的水稻，就迷住了。有的在算棵数，有的在数稻粒，有的在量高度。根据他们的计算，这块地有四万五千多蔸，每蔸有二十棵，平均每穗二百二十二粒，至少要打一万五千斤，他们把预产结果计算出来，情不自禁地伸出了舌头，并且急忙要党支部书记戴树林给他们介绍水稻管理的经验。戴树林对他们说，这里种植水稻还是第一次，水稻田原来全是荒地。这就使他们格外感到惊奇了。
    其实，这块水稻田是由一个洼水坑改成的，稻子长的并不好。如果不是他们自己跑到这块田上来，保险不会领他们到这里来参观。社长领我们去看的大面积水稻，比这里长的又高又密，我们随意捡了一个稻穗一数，就是三百零二粒。
    看了这个社的秋季作物后，党支部书记对我们说：如果今后不发生意外灾害，今年秋粮单位面积产量，不是以千为单位来计算，而是要用万了。他说：像这样高的单位面积产量，要那末多的粮食作物土地干什么呢？这里粮食作物土地平均每人只有四分九厘。往年因单位面积产量不高，需要国家供应很多粮食；今年夏季获得了大丰收，平均亩产一千八百斤，便反过来向国家卖了八万多斤余粮。现在，社员们看到秋季更大的丰收，已经开始嫌那四分九厘粮食地多了，他们想再用一部分土地来种植经济作物。
