Xinhua News Agency report: Shanghai's literary and art circles are fighting alongside steelworkers, using literary and artistic weapons to serve steel production. Currently, in the creation and performance of literature, drama, film, music, and art, "fighting for steel" has become the most prominent theme.

On the stage and screen, the heroic images of steelworkers are stirring the hearts of audiences, calling on them to contribute to the "ascension of the steel commander." The Shanghai People's Art Theater and the Shanghai Theater School are staging new plays depicting steelworkers fighting heroically, "Triumphant Song of Communism" and "Red Flags Flutter Everywhere." The Shanghai Film Actors Amateur Troupe is about to stage the new work "Steel Men, Iron Horses" by worker-writer Fei Liwen. In cinemas, more than 670,000 viewers have seen the new film "Ode to the Red Flag," which depicts eight advanced factories, including the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant. Musicians have composed dozens of songs praising the enthusiasm of steelworkers. In factories, schools, and neighborhoods, people can now be heard singing a new song, "For Steel." Musicians and opera performers also broadcast special programs for steelworkers on the radio. Writers and painters are also using their pens to join the ranks of the whole people fighting for steel. Recent issues of "Literary and Art Monthly," "Sprouts," and other publications and newspapers have continuously published their works. Traditional Chinese painters have even, for the first time, used traditional techniques to paint the raging flames of steelmaking furnaces and the heroic posture of steelmakers holding iron ladles and wearing asbestos clothing.

    上海文艺界燃起炼钢火焰
    据新华社讯　上海文艺界正和钢铁工人并肩作战，用文艺武器为钢铁生产服务。目前在文学、戏剧、电影、音乐、美术的创作和演出中，“为钢铁而战”已成为最突出的主题。
    在舞台和银幕上，钢铁工人的英雄形象激动着观众的心灵，呼唤他们去为“钢帅升帐”尽一份力量。上海人民艺术剧院、上海戏剧学校正在上演描写钢铁工人奋不顾身地战斗的新戏“共产主义的凯歌”和“红旗处处飘”，上海电影演员业余剧团马上要上演工人作家费礼文的新作“钢人铁马”。在电影院里，七天来已经有六十七万多观众看了描写上海第一钢铁厂等八个先进工厂的新片“红旗颂”。音乐家们已经创作了几十首歌颂炼钢工人干劲的歌曲。工厂、学校和里弄中，现在到处可以听到人们在唱着一支“为了钢”的新歌。音乐家和戏曲艺人们还到广播电台上为钢铁工人播送特别节目。作家和画家也用自己的笔参加进全民为钢而战的行列，最近的“文艺月报”、“萌芽”等刊物和报纸上，不断刊载着他们的作品。国画家并且破天荒地用传统技法画出了炼钢炉的熊熊火焰，和手拿铁勺、身穿石棉衣的炼钢手的豪迈姿态。
