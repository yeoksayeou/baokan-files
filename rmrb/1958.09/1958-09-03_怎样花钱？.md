　　How to Spend Money?
　　Liu Zongtang
    This year's large agricultural increase has brought many new problems. "What to do with the farmers' increased money?" is one of these problems. It requires us to consider it early and arrange it properly.

    In the view of some people, this does not seem to be a problem: "If you have money, spend it." Yes, anyone with money will spend it. However, to spend it appropriately, especially when farmers and agricultural cooperatives suddenly increase so much money, and to ensure that every penny is used effectively, is not a simple matter. Whoever ignores it will be passive, and whoever ignores it will make mistakes.

    It is naturally a great thing for farmers to have more money. However, if it is not handled well, good things can sometimes have bad effects. In the past, some places experienced this after a bumper harvest: because cadres did not pay attention to helping farmers arrange ways to spend their money, some farmers engaged in illegal commercial speculation, using the money to impact the market, frantically搶購 materials, and creating a tense atmosphere. Many farmers spent their money recklessly in this way; some could not抢購 anything, and they were emotional, complaining about the government and not being active in production. Can these lessons be repeated again this year?

    The Party committees in Sichuan have studied this issue early, helped farmers appropriately expand the public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives, and arranged correct outlets for these accumulations, specifically implementing Chairman Mao's instruction to consider the new problems after the large increase in grain production early. This not only prevents the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of some farmers and certain chaotic phenomena that may occur in the market, but also further effectively uses a large amount of funds for expanded reproduction, accelerating the speed of industrial development. This is entirely in line with the spirit of the entire people running industry, which is beneficial to the country and also beneficial to the long-term and immediate interests of farmers. The vast majority of farmers will warmly welcome this.

    This year, the country's agriculture has achieved an unprecedented increase in production, and there must be many problems similar to the above. All localities should consider them early and actively solve them.

　　怎样花钱？
　　刘宗棠
    今年农业大增产带来了许多新问题。“农民钱多了怎么办？”是这些问题中的一个。它需要我们及早考虑，妥善安排。
    在有些人看来，这似乎算不得什么问题：“钱多了，花嘛。”是的，有了钱谁也会把它花出去。但是，要花得适当，特别是农民和农业社一下增加那么多的钱，都能像钢用到刀口上，使每分钱都发挥最大的作用，却不是一件简单的事情。谁要忽视它，谁就要被动，谁就要犯错误。
    农民钱多了，自然是件大好事。但是如果处理不好，好事有时也会产生坏作用的。往年有的地方大丰收后就出现过这种情况：由于干部不注意帮助农民安排钱的出路，结果就有一部分农民搞非法的商业投机活动，拿了钱向市场冲击，拼命抢购物资，制造紧张空气。许多农民就这样胡乱地把钱花光了；有的抢购不到东西，还闹情绪，抱怨政府，生产不积极。这些教训今年还能让它再重复吗？
    四川各地党委提早研究这个问题，帮助农民适当地扩大农业社的公共积累，并为这些积累安排了正确的出路，具体地贯彻执行了毛主席要我们及早考虑粮食大增产后的新问题的指示。这样做不仅可以防止某些农民的资本主义自发倾向和市场上可能发生的某些混乱现象，而且可以进一步把大量资金有效地使用到扩大再生产上去，加快了工业发展的速度。这完全符合全民办工业的精神，对国家有利，对农民的长远利益和眼前利益也都有利。绝大多数农民一定会热诚欢迎这样做的。
    今年全国农业获得空前大增产，类似以上的问题一定还有不少，各地都应该及早考虑，主动解决。
