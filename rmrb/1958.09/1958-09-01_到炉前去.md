　　Go to the Furnace Front
　　Wu Lü
    With the large-scale construction of indigenous blast furnaces, technical forces are insufficient, and technical measures cannot keep up in time, resulting in some indigenous blast furnaces producing slag but not iron, or failing to produce iron normally. This is a problem urgently to be solved in the current production of indigenous blast furnaces. The technical guidance group of Hubei, the iron and steel medical teams of Shanxi and Beijing, and other units, have provided a good experience for overcoming the technical barriers of indigenous blast furnaces: organizing forces to go to the furnace front, treating the furnace at the furnace front, and training soldiers at the furnace front.
    Is there a technical barrier in the production of indigenous blast furnaces? Is this strange? Not at all. The biggest characteristic of indigenous blast furnaces is their flexibility. They can have this structure, or that structure; they can use this equipment, or that equipment; they can use this material, or that material. Because of their flexibility, the construction and production of indigenous blast furnaces are indeed relatively simple, requiring neither very complex technical equipment nor highly skilled technical workers, and they can blossom everywhere and become popular nationwide in a very short time. But precisely because of their flexibility, the construction and production of indigenous blast furnaces are also relatively complex, and they often encounter technical problems that are not problems at all for modern large blast furnaces. For example, the structure of modern large blast furnaces all has rigorous scientific design, using high-grade refractory bricks as furnace lining, and having hot blast stoves for blowing air, thus concentrating heat, maintaining furnace temperature, and normally producing iron, generally without any problems. But indigenous blast furnaces are precisely prone to problems in these areas. Isn't this more complex?
    Both simple and complex, which seems contradictory, is actually a dialectical relationship of unity of opposites. "Everything has its advantages and disadvantages." The flexibility of indigenous blast furnaces brings convenience in some aspects, but also difficulties in others. Anyone who does not understand this dialectical relationship, and only sees the simple side of indigenous blast furnaces, ignoring the side that indigenous blast furnaces also have relatively complex technical problems, and does not have sufficient ideological preparation for solving the technical problems of indigenous blast furnaces, will not be able to overcome the technical barriers of indigenous blast furnaces. Moreover, today's furnace workers are mostly yesterday's farmers, new recruits who have just put down their hoes and turned to the iron and steel front, and it is not so easy to master scientific smelting techniques all at once. Anyone who ignores this point will not be able to achieve technical victory.
    How to solve the technical problems of indigenous blast furnaces? The most important thing is to organize forces to go to the furnace front. The technical problems of indigenous blast furnaces vary from furnace to furnace. Indigenous blast furnaces with different structures, different equipment, and different materials have different technical problems. Only by going to the furnace front, grasping the particularity of contradictions, taking different technical measures for different indigenous blast furnaces, treating the furnace at the furnace front, and finding a pattern for the normal iron production of similar indigenous blast furnaces, can we break through the technical barriers of indigenous blast furnaces and solve the technical problems of indigenous blast furnaces.
    The technical guidance group of Hubei organized forces to go to the furnace front, first cultivated "experimental fields," then held on-site meetings, treated the furnace at the furnace front, and trained soldiers at the furnace front, overcoming technical barriers and training the team, solving two major problems in one fell swoop, which is a leadership method worth promoting.

　　到炉前去
　　吴滤
    土高炉大量建设起来，技术力量不足，技术措施一时跟不上，以致有些土高炉出渣不出铁，或者不能正常出铁。这是当前土高炉生产中一个亟待解决的问题。湖北的技术辅导团，山西和北京的钢铁医疗队等单位，为攻克土高炉的技术关提供了一个很好的经验：组织力量到炉前去，炉前治炉，炉前练兵。
    土高炉的生产中也有一座技术关，这件事奇怪不奇怪呢？一点也不奇怪。土高炉最大的特点是灵活。可以是这样的构造，也可以是那样的构造，可以用这样的设备，也可以用那样的设备；可以用这样的材料，也可以用那样的材料。因为灵活，土高炉的建造和生产确实都比较简单，不需要很复杂的技术装备和具有很高水平的技术工人，能够在很短的时间内遍地开花，普及全国。但也正因为灵活，土高炉的建造和生产却又比较复杂，它常常遇到一些在现代化的大高炉说来根本不是问题的技术问题。例如，现代化大高炉的构造都有严谨的科学设计，用高级耐火砖做炉衬，有热风炉鼓风，因而集中热量，保持炉温，正常出铁，一般都不发生什么问题，而土高炉却恰恰在这些问题上容易发生问题。这不是又比较复杂吗？
    既简单又复杂，看来自相矛盾，其实也是对立统一的辩证关系。“凡事有利必有弊”，土高炉的灵活性，在某些方面有简单之便，在另一些方面又有复杂之难。谁要是不了解这种辩证的关系，只看到土高炉简单的一面，忽略了土高炉也有比较复杂的技术问题的一面，对解决土高炉的技术问题没有足够的思想准备，就过不了土高炉的技术关。而且今天的炉前工，大都是昨天的农民，一个刚刚放下锄头转到钢铁战线上的新兵，一下掌握科学的冶炼技术也不是那末容易的。谁要是忽视这一点，也不能取得技术上的胜利。
    怎样解决土高炉的技术问题呢？最重要的就是组织力量到炉前去。土高炉的技术问题因炉而异。构造不同、设备不同、用料不同的土高炉各有不同的技术问题。只有到炉前去，抓住矛盾的特殊性，针对不同的土高炉采取不同的技术措施，炉前治炉，为同类的土高炉正常出铁摸出一条规律来，才能突破土高炉的技术关。解决土高炉的技术问题。
    湖北的技术辅导团，组织力量到炉前去，先种“试验田”，后开现场会，炉前治炉，炉前练兵，攻下了技术关，训练了队伍，一举而解决了两大问题，是一个值得提倡的领导方法。
