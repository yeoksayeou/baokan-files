Editor's Note: On August 25th, this column raised the question of "How to Run Rural Canteens Well?" Many readers have written to introduce their experiences, and now we are publishing a few of them here. From this, everyone can see that the worries that farmers eating in public canteens "will lose their habit of thrift," "there won't be enough food," and "the canteen's cooking won't suit their tastes" are all unnecessary.

　　Many Varieties of Food and Dishes, All to Everyone's Taste
    The Jiangzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Zhang Canheng Township, Dongguang County, Hebei, has set up four public canteens, organized by team.

    When the canteens were first established, some people were worried about overeating when the rationing system was abolished. But this was not the case. The masses can consciously find ways to eat more substitutes to save food and money. They have the following three methods for saving food: First, every meal has vegetable soup. Green vegetables, pumpkin, and batter are cooked into a fragrant, sweet, and sticky soup. Drinking the soup is free, and many people can fill themselves up at night without spending a penny. Second, steam large stuffed buns. Plain steamed buns sell for three cents, and stuffed buns also sell for three cents. One bun is equivalent to two steamed buns, and even those with large appetites eat no more than three buns per meal, which saves money and food. Third, eat more fermented food and less unleavened food. Except for making dumplings and noodles on holidays, they usually don't eat unleavened food. This saves both food and money. In ten days, the entire cooperative saved 227 jin of food, and each person spent an average of only 12 cents per day.

    The food and dishes are diversified, with staple foods and side dishes. Staple foods include cornbread, dark steamed buns, white steamed buns, and vegetable buns; side dishes include pumpkin soup, vegetable marrow soup, wild vegetable soup, and three-in-one melon and vegetable soup; dishes include scrambled eggs, salted eggs, fried dough sticks, sesame twists, and stir-fried eggplant, etc. Members can eat whatever they want. If patients and guests want to eat noodles or dumplings, they can choose whatever they want, and they will be cooked and fried in time.

    The cooperative stipulates that members have one day off every fifteen days. On this day, they eat two meals, buns in the morning and dumplings in the afternoon. The members enjoyed their holiday. An old lady in her fifties, eating dumplings, said, "Resting from work, listening to opera, and the whole family eating dumplings, just like the workers in the big cities."

　　Saves Food and Eats Well
    Originally, some people thought that running a canteen would require eating more food and raising the grain retention standard. Facts have proved that this idea is wrong. Public canteens save more food than cooking at home. In the Huangxinzhuang Canteen in Neihuang County, Henan, an average of 14 liang of grain per person per day is enough. Does eating less grain mean eating poorly? No. In Xinxiang Prefecture, all counties have basically "collectivized canteens." Most canteens serve two meals of steamed buns a day, and some serve three. In Qianhua Village, Neihuang, in addition to soup and rice to meet needs, adults over 16 can eat 10 steamed buns a day, and children can eat three to six. Many members can't finish them and often return them. Eating like this, each person only uses one jin and one liang of grain per day. In Guantun Agricultural Cooperative, Fengqiu County, 839 people ate in the canteen, saving 3,140 jin and 4 liang of grain in one month, an average of 3 jin and 11 liang per person per month. According to a survey by Li He Cooperative, the living standards of 84.5% of the members who joined the canteen have improved compared to before joining the canteen.　CPC Xinxiang Prefectural Committee Office

    Canteen Follows the Production Team
    Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, is a mountainous area. Many township and cooperative members live scattered, and the land is fragmented. Many canteens here move to wherever the production team is working, so that members can eat as soon as they finish work, saving time on commuting. In terms of food, each canteen prepares food according to local eating habits, with "geta" (cornbread) porridge in the morning, rice and stewed vegetables (or noodles, etc.) at noon, and mixed rice in the evening. Everyone is very satisfied with these two methods. Some members were worried when the canteen was first established, saying, "I'm not used to the communal pot. It's either hard or soft. My health isn't good, and I'm afraid it will be difficult in the long run." Now they say, "The communal pot cooks fragrant food, saves firewood and grain. As long as it continues like this, who would want to leave the canteen?"

　　Regulations and Management Rules of the Miaozhuang Canteen in Pingshun County
    1. Participation in the canteen is based on the principle of voluntariness. Entering and leaving the canteen requires personal application and approval by the Canteen Living Committee to be effective. Democratic leadership is implemented, and all members participating in the canteen democratically elect five to seven people to form the Living Committee. Participating personnel: one management committee member, one team leader, one steward, and one male and one female member representative. The task is to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the members, run the canteen well, and adjust living conditions.
    2. Three to five cooks with high socialist consciousness, good class composition, and cooking skills are selected, an average of one cook for every thirty people, two men and three women. Generally, the steward is also required to be a cook. Male laborers should receive an annual remuneration of 300 to 350 work points, and female laborers should receive 150 to 200 work points.
    3. Members' grain consumption is based on the allocation standard for each household. If there is a shortage, members can be mobilized to help each other and voluntarily put all surplus grain into the canteen at a discounted price. The Canteen Management Committee will study and adjust its use. The canteen can make a variety of foods that members like to eat based on the conditions, and each member can choose and purchase according to their own economic and grain conditions, ensuring that it is easy to save grain and that everyone can eat their fill and eat well.
    4. It is necessary to implement cooking according to the fixed amount per person (filling out a meal form), buying meals with grain coupons and meal tickets, determining grain by meals, and distributing tickets uniformly according to grain, with the principle of more eating, more apportionment, and less eating, less apportionment.
    5. If a member is seriously ill, the canteen will make sick meals within three days. After three days, with the approval of the Living Committee, they can take grain home to recuperate. The canteen will provide special care for those with chronic minor illnesses.

### 怎样办好农村食堂？

专栏：

　　怎样办好农村食堂？
    编者按　8月25日在这个栏里提出了“怎样办好农村食堂”的问题。许多读者都来信介绍经验，现在选刊几件在这里。大家由此可以看到，所谓农民吃公共食堂“会丢掉节约习惯”，“粮食会不够吃”，“食堂作菜不会合口味”等等顾虑都是多余的。
　　饭菜花样多　件件合口味
    河北东光县张参恒乡姜庄农业社，以队为单位办了四个公共食堂。
    刚办食堂的时候，一提取消定量，有些人耽心吃超了。但实际不是这样，群众都能自觉地想法多吃代食品省粮食省钱。他们在节约粮食方面有以下三个办法：第一，顿顿有菜汤。青菜加南瓜和面糊，熬的又香又甜又粘糊，喝汤不要钱，许多人晚上一个钱不花闹个饱。第二，蒸大菜包子。无馅的馒头卖三分，有馅的包子也卖三分，包子一个顶两个馒头，大饭量的一顿不过吃三个，又省钱又省粮。第三，多吃发面的，少吃死面的。除了假日包饺子赶面条外，平常是不吃死面的。这样又节省粮食又省钱。十天的工夫全社节约粮食二百二十七斤，每天每人平均只花一角二分钱。
    饭菜多样化，有主食副食，主食有窝头、黑馒头、白馒头、菜包子；副食有南瓜汤、菜瓜汤、野菜汤以及瓜菜三合汤；菜有炒鸡子、咸鸡子、油条、麻花、炒茄子等，社员随意吃。如果病人、客人愿吃面条、饺子可随意挑选，及时烹炸。
    社里规定社员每十五天休假一天。这天吃两顿饭，早上吃包子，下午吃水饺。社员愉快的度过了假日。一个五十多岁的老大娘吃着饺子说：“歇着工，听着戏，合家老少吃着饺子，像大地方的工人一样。”

　　又省粮食又吃得好
    原来有些人认为，办食堂就得要多吃粮食，就得要提高留粮标准。事实证明，这种想法错了。公共食堂比自己家里作饭还节省粮食。河南内黄县黄辛庄食堂，一天一个人平均只吃十四两粮食就足够了。吃粮少是否就吃得不好呢？不是的。新乡专区各县已经基本“集体食堂化”了，绝大多数食堂差不多都是一天二顿馍，有的一天三顿馍。内黄前化村，除汤饭满足需要外，十六岁以上的大人每天可吃十个馍，小孩可吃三个到六个。有很多社员吃不完，经常退回来。他们这样吃，每天一人只合一斤一两粮食。封丘县官屯农业社，有八百三十九人在食堂吃饭，一个月即节约粮食三千一百四十斤四两，每人平均一月节约三斤十一两。李和社调查，加入食堂吃饭的社员，有84.5％的社员比入食堂前生活有所提高。　中共新乡地委办公室
    食堂跟着生产队走
    山西平顺县是山区，有很多乡、社社员居住分散，地块零碎，这里的许多食堂就根据需要，生产队到哪里干活，食堂就往哪里移动，使社员们一收工就能吃到饭，节省来往跑路时间。在饭样上，各个食堂都是根据本地生活习惯，早上圪塔（窝窝）稀饭，中午米饭烩菜（或面条等），晚上和子饭。这两种办法大家都很满意。有的社员在食堂刚建立时有顾虑，说“大锅饭不习惯，不是硬就是软，咱的身体不大好，时间长了怕难办。”现在却说：“大锅饭作的香，又省柴又省粮，只要长如此，谁肯离食堂？”

　　平顺县苗庄食堂的制度和管理条例
    1、参加食堂以自愿为原则。出入食堂需个人申请，经食堂生活委员会批准，始为有效。实行民主领导，由参加食堂的全体社员民主选出五至七人组成生活委员会。参加的人员：管理委员一人，队长一人，事务长一人，社员代表男女各一人。任务是加强对社员的政治思想领导，办好食堂，调剂好生活。
    2、选出社会主义觉悟高，阶级成份好，有做饭技术的炊事员三至五人，平均每三十个人一个炊事员，男二女三，一般要求事务长兼炊事员，男劳力全年报酬三百至三百五十个工，女劳力一百五十至二百个工为宜。
    3、社员吃粮按各户分配标准，不足部分可发动社员互相协助，自愿把余粮全部投入食堂折价付款，由食堂管理委员会研究调整使用。食堂可根据条件做出社员喜爱吃的多种多样饭菜，各个社员根据自己的经济条件和粮食条件自行选购，保证做到便于节约粮食，又能人人吃饱、吃好。
    4、要实行按人定量做饭（填报饭表）以粮票和饭票买饭，以饭定粮，以粮定分统一分票，多吃多摊，少吃少摊的原则。
    5、社员有重病，三天内食堂做病号饭，三天外经生活委员会批准带粮到家养病，常年有轻微疾病者食堂另行照顾。
    6、油、盐、煤、菜（包括社员旧存的、自留地菜和社地菜）及粮一律分等作价投入食堂。
    7、社员自留地可根据投资大小作价归社，按队统一经营，以适应食堂需要（社员房前屋后种植瓜菜玉米等仍归自己）。
    8、社员养猪可按队投资，集体喂养、分红、并筹集公积金。
    9、产妇可自行起伙。
    10、社员招待来往亲戚时，食堂另招待一顿好饭，其余和社员同灶，粮票自行解决。来往开会和社员外出食堂可发给粮票。
    11、社员家庭副业，养鸡养兔、仍各自经营。
    12、食堂工作生活委员会每周研究一次，公布一次账目。
    13，发扬尊老爱幼的精神，对年老、病、弱的社员给予照顾。
    14、食堂要做到家、院、灶具、饭菜卫生，根绝四害。社员进食堂要求养成饭前洗手的习惯。
    15、红白喜事到食堂吃饭，所吃好饭除事主按标准交粮票外，不足部分食堂补助。但不能铺张浪费。
