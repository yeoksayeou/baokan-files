Increased Military Spending, Decreased Revenue
Unprecedented Budget Deficit in Peacetime
The U.S. government's policy of frantically expanding armaments and preparing for war, and creating tension around the world, has resulted in extraordinarily large budget expenditures, greatly exacerbating the United States' financial difficulties.

The "Mid-Year Review" of President Eisenhower's budget message, released by the U.S. Bureau of the Budget on the 11th, announced the largest budget expenditures in peacetime and the largest budget deficit since World War II. This "Mid-Year Review" stated that the estimated expenditures of the U.S. federal government for the 1959 fiscal year, beginning on July 1 this year, have increased to $79.223 billion, while the projected revenue has decreased to $67 billion. As a result, the budget deficit has reached a staggering $12.223 billion.

From the figures released by the Bureau of the Budget, it can be seen that military expenditures are the largest item in the federal government's expenditures, with direct military expenditures alone accounting for $40.8 billion.

As for the reasons for the reduction in fiscal revenue, the Bureau of the Budget admitted that it was due to the ongoing economic crisis. The "Mid-Year Review" stated: "The business depression has caused greater financial damage. This recession has seriously affected the income from income tax, corporate tax, and domestic excise tax. It has reduced the government's projected revenue by nearly $7.5 billion." (Xinhua News Agency)

    军费增加　收入下降
    和平时期预算赤字空前庞大
    美国政府疯狂扩军备战和在世界各地制造紧张局势的政策使预算开支异常庞大，大大加剧了美国的财政困难。
    美国预算局11日发表的对艾森豪威尔预算咨文的“年中回顾”，宣布了和平时期美国最庞大的预算开支以及第二次世界大战以来最庞大的预算赤字。这份“年中回顾”说，从今年7月1日开始的1959年财政年度美国联邦政府的支出概算增加到七百九十二亿二千三百万美元，而预计的收入则下降到六百七十亿美元。结果预算赤字高达一百二十二亿二千三百万美元。
    从预算局公布的数字中可以看出，军事开支是联邦政府开支中最大的项目，单单是直接军事开支就占四百零八亿美元。
    至于财政收入减少的原因，预算局承认，是由于经济危机还在发展。“年中回顾”说：“企业萧条在财政上造成了更大的损害。这一衰退严重影响了所得税、公司税和国内消费税的收入。它使政府所预计的收入下降了几乎七十五亿美元。”　　　　（据新华社）
