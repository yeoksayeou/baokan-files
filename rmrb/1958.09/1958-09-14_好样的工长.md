    Good Job, Foreman
    Chen Guoji
    The forty-ton bell at the top of the blast furnace was being hoisted. General Party Secretary Wu, Chief Engineer Fang, and Manager Tian, among others, came to the site, watching it slowly ascend.
    Commanding the hoisting was Foreman Wang, who had rich experience. When the bell rose to more than fifty meters, the sixty-ton crane suddenly broke down, and the bell was spinning in the air, unable to go up or down. Foreman Wang was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan, thinking, "This bell is the result of so much hard work. It was transported here by land and sea. And to produce iron ahead of schedule, we can't do without this main piece of equipment.” The situation was tense. If the steel cable were to break, the bell would fall from the air, and everything would be over. Foreman Wang, at this moment, disregarded his own safety. He shouted, “Fix the crane immediately!” and quickly climbed towards the seventy-plus meter high altitude, climbing along the steel cable to the trolley, lying on it to repair. The people below were worried for him. Several leading comrades were both anxious and admired him. They didn't breathe a sigh of relief until the crane was repaired.
    "Who went up there?" General Party Secretary Wu asked.
    "Foreman Wang, a staunch Communist Party member," Manager Tian said.
    "Ah! Good job," Secretary Wu said with a smile.
    Foreman Wang is fifty years old, and his drive is so strong that people call him a good foreman. Foreman Wang said that he suffered enough bullying in the old society, and life has been getting better day by day since liberation. In order to build a strong motherland, how can we not work hard!

    好样的工长
    陈国基
    高炉顶的四十吨大钟起吊了，总党委武书记、方总工程师和田经理等都来到现场，望着它慢慢上升。
    指挥起吊的是有丰富经验的王工长，当大钟上升到五十多公尺时，六十吨吊车突然坏了，大钟在空中打转转，上下不得。王工长急得像热锅上的蚂蚁一般，心想：“这个钟花了多少人的心血，陆运、海运才运到这里，而提早出铁，又不能缺少这个主要设备。”情况很紧，万一钢丝绳一扭断，大钟从空中掉下来，那一切都完了。王工长这时也顾不得个人生命的安全了，喊了一句“马上修好吊车”就迅速地朝七十多公尺的高空爬去，沿着钢丝绳爬到小车上，躺在上面修理。底下的人都为他耽心，几个领导同志是又着急又钦佩，直到吊车修好后，他们才轻快地舒了一口气。
    “上去的是谁？”总党委武书记问。
    “王工长，一个坚强的共产党员。”田经理说。
    “啊！好样的。”武书记笑着说。
    王工长是五十岁的人了，干劲是这样猛，人们称他是好样的工长。王工长说他在旧社会受够欺凌，解放后生活一天好一天，为了建设强大的祖国，怎么能不用猛劲干呢！
