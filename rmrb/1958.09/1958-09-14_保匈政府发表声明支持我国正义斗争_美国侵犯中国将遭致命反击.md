Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 12th: The Bulgarian government issued a statement on the 12th, expressing its full support for the Chinese people's just struggle against the shameless American aggression and provocation.

The statement said that any infringement upon the People's Republic of China would mean a provocation against all countries of the powerful socialist camp and all peace-loving people. The Bulgarian government and all the Bulgarian people unconditionally support the struggle of the 600 million Chinese people.

The statement said that Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other Chinese coastal islands are integral parts of Chinese territory. The U.S. imperialists' occupation of these islands not only violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China, but also violates the United Nations Charter and all norms of international law. Liberating these islands from U.S. imperialist occupation is the sacred right of the Chinese people.

The statement expressed its full support for the Chinese government's decision regarding the scope of China's territorial waters, supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area and the stern position expressed in the letter from Chairman Khrushchev of the Soviet Council of Ministers to U.S. President Eisenhower.

The statement said that the government of the People's Republic of China has the absolute right to arrange its own internal affairs. Any attempt by the United States to infringe upon the sovereignty of the great People's Republic of China will be decisively struck by all peace-loving people of the world. The statement concluded by saying that the Bulgarian government and people stand completely united with the Chinese people, fully supporting the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Chinese territory occupied by the U.S. imperialists, and supporting all efforts aimed at eliminating the threat of war in the Far East and maintaining peace in this region.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 12th: A statement issued by the Hungarian government on the 12th resolutely condemned the U.S. government's shameless provocation and gross interference in China's internal affairs. The statement expressed firm support for the Chinese government's decision on territorial waters and fully endorsed the just position held by China and the Soviet Union on the Taiwan situation.

The statement said that the Hungarian people, who are often subjected to American interference conspiracies, resolutely condemn the U.S. government's interference in China's internal affairs and fully support the legitimate interests of the fraternal Chinese people in liberating their own territory. The Hungarian government firmly states that if the U.S. government, disregarding the rights of the Chinese people and the warnings of the Chinese government, continues to persist in its aggressive plans against the Chinese people and imposes war on the Chinese people, the Hungarian people will, together with the Soviet Union and the people of other socialist countries, give full support to the Chinese people's legitimate struggle. The statement concluded by saying that the Hungarian people are deeply convinced that the Chinese people, who are sympathized with and supported by socialist countries, Asian and African countries, and all peace-loving people, will surely defeat the aggressive forces of imperialism.
