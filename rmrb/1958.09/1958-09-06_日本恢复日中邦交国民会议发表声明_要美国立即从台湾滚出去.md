    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 5th: The Japan National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations issued a statement on the 4th, demanding that the United States immediately cease its war provocations and interference in China's internal affairs in the Taiwan Strait area, and immediately withdraw all troops from the Taiwan area.

The statement called on Japanese groups and the Japanese people to unite and launch joint actions to smash the US-Chiang war provocations in the Taiwan Strait.

    The statement also stated that the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations will further strengthen the movement to promote Japan-China friendship and restore diplomatic relations in order to completely smash the US-Chiang conspiracy and strive for the strengthening of Japan-China friendship and the restoration of diplomatic relations.
