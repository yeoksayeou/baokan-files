Xinhua News Agency reporter commentary on Sino-U.S. talks:

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 25th. This reporter reports: The Chinese and American ambassadors held their fourth meeting on the 25th to seek solutions to ease and eliminate tensions in the Far East.

Like the previous meetings, no communiqué was issued on the progress of the talks after this meeting, but it was simply announced that they would meet again on September 30th. People are beginning to suspect that the talks have encountered obstacles.

Although the proceedings of the talks are kept secret, the talks must have reflected the distinctly different attitudes taken by the Chinese and American governments.

According to various sources, the United States is still unreasonably accusing the Chinese government of "aggression" for taking military action to punish the Chiang Kai-shek clique's troops on the coastal islands for their provocative actions and to recover these islands, which have belonged to China since ancient times. However, anyone with a clear mind can see that China is exercising sovereignty over its own territory, and there is no question of "aggression" at all. The current hostilities around the coastal islands of China are a continuation of the civil war, which would have had nothing to do with the United States had the United States not interfered.

The United States says that the Chinese government's military actions on its own islands are the cause of international tension. This is a black-and-white reversal of the facts. Historical records clearly show that China's civil war has been going on for many years and has not caused any international tension. It was only after the United States carried out military intervention in China's civil war that the issue became one of U.S. interference in Chinese affairs, thereby creating serious international tension.

The United States insists on achieving a "ceasefire" as the primary condition for resolving the issue. As everyone knows, there is no ceasefire issue between China and the United States at present, because there is no war between the two countries. The issue of a ceasefire between the Chinese government and the remaining forces of Chiang Kai-shek is entirely a matter of China's internal affairs, and the United States has no right to speak on it. The U.S. attempt to keep its troops stationed in the area through a so-called "ceasefire" is an infringement of China's sovereignty and makes the prospect of a peaceful resolution between the Chinese government and the remaining forces of Chiang Kai-shek doubly complicated and more difficult.

The United States attempts to put pressure on China to "declare the abandonment of the use of force" and slanders the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory as "territorial expansion." This kind of demand and statement by the United States is extremely shameless. The Chinese people have every right to use any method they choose, including the use of armed forces, to recover their own territory. There is no so-called "territorial expansion" issue at all, because unlike the United States, which sends its troops everywhere to other countries for territorial expansion, China only wants to recover its own territory. The issue of using peaceful or military means on its own territory is simply none of the United States' business.

The United States insists that Taiwan, Penghu, and other coastal islands are not Chinese territory. This is the biggest lie in history. Not only did the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations affirm that these islands are Chinese territory, but even former U.S. President Truman, who is still alive, once declared as U.S. President that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory.

The United States argues that they must intervene in Taiwan and other Chinese islands because they have a "defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. However, this scrap of paper in the eyes of the Chinese people cannot conceal the United States' naked act of armed aggression. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime in Taiwan was created by the United States. The United States first occupied Taiwan and then concluded the so-called "treaty." The Chinese people cannot allow the United States to carry out aggression based on that completely illegal and invalid "treaty."

The United States finds that their position on every issue in this dispute is completely untenable, and it seems that they are trying to avoid discussing matters of principle, and are trying to use the public's concern about war to promote their "ceasefire" conspiracy. In fact, the United States' "ceasefire" proposal is a fraud, a sugar-coated poison, which enables the United States to continue to violate China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, continue to occupy Taiwan, and expand its aggression from Taiwan to the coastal islands and the Chinese mainland.

This "ceasefire" conspiracy of the United States will not only fail to ease the explosive situation caused by the U.S. policy of aggression and the U.S. aggression against a large country like China, but will only make the situation more dangerous. The Chinese government has pointed out that the only way to ease the tension in the Far East and avoid war is to eliminate the root cause of the tension - the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Taiwan Strait area.

### 美国“停火”阴谋只能使局势更加危险  避免战争的唯一办法是美军撤出台湾

    美国“停火”阴谋只能使局势更加危险
    避免战争的唯一办法是美军撤出台湾
    ·新华社记者评中美会谈·
    新华社华沙25日电  本社记者报道：中美两国大使25日举行了第四次会谈，谋求缓和和消除远东紧张局势的解决办法。
    像前几次会谈一样，这次会后没有就会谈的进展发表公报，而只是简单地宣布一下他们将在9月30日再次举行会谈。人们开始怀疑会谈是否已经遇到障碍。
    虽然会谈的进行情况是保守秘密的，但是，会谈一定已经反映了中美两国政府所采取的截然不同的态度。
    根据各方消息看来，美国仍在无理指责中国政府为了惩罚沿海岛屿的蒋介石集团军队的挑衅行动和为了收复这些自古以来就属于中国的岛屿而采取的军事行动是“侵略”。但是，任何头脑清醒的人都看得到，中国是在它自己的领土上行使主权的，根本不发生什么“侵略”的问题。目前在中国沿海岛屿周围的敌对行动是内战的继续，要不是美国进行了干涉，这种敌对行动本来是同美国毫无关系的。
    美国说，中国政府在自己的岛屿上的军事行动是造成国际紧张局势的原因，这是颠倒黑白的胡说。历史的记录清楚表明，中国的内战已经进行了好多年，并没有造成任何国际紧张局势。只是在美国对中国内战进行军事干涉之后，才使问题变成为美国干涉中国事务的问题，从而造成了严重的国际紧张局势。
    美国坚持实现“停火”作为解决问题的首要条件。大家知道，中国和美国之间目前并不存在停火问题，因为两国之间并没有发生战争。而在中国政府和蒋介石残余部队之间实现停火的问题，则完全是中国的内政问题，美国对此没有发言权。美国企图通过所谓“停火”而把它自己的军队驻在这个地区是对中国主权的侵犯，并且使得和平解决中国政府和蒋介石残余部队之间的问题的前景加倍复杂化和变得更加困难。
    美国企图对中国施加压力，要中国“宣布放弃使用武力”，并且诬蔑中国人民解放自己的领土是“领土的扩张”。美国这种要求和说法真是无耻已极。中国人民有充分权利使用它所选择的任何方法，包括使用武装力量在内，来收复自己的领土。根本不存在所谓的“领土扩张”问题，因为同到处派遣自己的军队到其他国家去进行领土扩张的美国不一样，中国只是要收复它自己的领土。在自己的领土上使用和平或军事手段的问题根本同美国无关。
    美国硬说台湾、澎湖和其他沿海岛屿并不是中国的领土。这是历史上前所未闻的最大的谎言。不仅仅是开罗和波茨坦宣言确定这些岛屿是中国的领土，甚至现在还活着的前美国总统杜鲁门也曾经以美国总统的身份宣布过台湾是中国领土的一部分。
    美国强辩说，他们必须干涉台湾和中国其他岛屿，因为他们同蒋介石集团缔结了“防御条约”。但是，这张中国人民眼里的废纸，掩盖不了美国赤裸裸的武装侵略行径。台湾的蒋介石傀儡政权是美国制造的，美国首先占领台湾然后才缔结了所谓的“条约”。中国人民不能容许美国根据那个完全非法和无效的“条约”来进行侵略。
    美国发现他们在这个争执中的一切问题上所采取的立场是完全站不住脚的，看来他们正在努力避免讨论原则问题，而企图利用公众对于战争的忧虑心理，来推销他们的“停火”阴谋。实际上，美国的“停火”建议是一个骗局，是包了糖衣的毒药，它使美国能够继续侵犯中国的主权和领土完整，继续占领台湾，并且把它的侵略从台湾扩大到沿海岛屿和中国大陆。
    美国的这种“停火”阴谋不但不能缓和由于美国的侵略政策以及美国对像中国这样的大国进行的侵略而造成的爆炸性局势，却只会使局势变得更加危险。中国政府已经指出，缓和远东的紧张局势和避免战争的唯一办法就是消除紧张局势的根源——美国军队立即从台湾海峡地区撤出去。
