Create one iron-producing county after another with a thousand tons, one province after another with ten thousand tons
As long as you have confidence, even a thousand tons is not difficult.
Jincheng jumps from fifty to one thousand.

According to the Shanxi Daily, after days and nights of hard work, the 370,000 people of Jincheng County released a big satellite on the 21st with a daily output of 1,002 tons of pig iron for the whole county.

In the first half of the month, the county's daily iron production was only more than 50 tons. In order to quickly reverse this backward situation, the county party committee held an emergency meeting and decided that the whole party and the whole people should work together to strive for a bumper harvest of iron smelting. They also established an iron smelting "experimental field" in the Nancun Satellite People's Commune to gain experience to guide the overall work. On the 15th, after an earthen furnace in this people's commune created a new record of producing 10 tons of iron per day, the county party committee immediately held an on-site meeting here to disseminate the experience of smelting iron in earthen furnaces in a timely manner, and called on the people of the county to use various indigenous methods to smelt iron, ensuring a production of 1,000 tons of iron on the 21st. After the meeting, all people's communes put forward new goals for iron smelting, and launched a competition between communes, factories, and furnaces to launch satellites and seize red flags. In order to ensure a rapid leap forward in iron smelting production, the county party committee, headed by Liu Wenshan, the first secretary of the county party committee, organized a general headquarters. The county party committee transferred four secretaries and thirteen members to sit and supervise the key iron smelting areas such as Badong, Nancun, Gaodu, Chengguan, and Donggou. The party committees of the people's communes also transferred two-thirds of their members to form sub-headquarters to direct more than 94,000 iron and steel troops day and night to attack iron smelting. 70% of the cadres drawn from the county-level directly affiliated organs and the personnel of the provincial and prefectural party committee iron and steel inspection teams were unified and organized to implement the furnace contract responsibility system, eating, living, and working with the masses to ensure that not even an ounce less than the iron production task was completed. In order to ensure that the mining, transportation, fuel supply and technical force in key iron smelting areas could adapt to the requirements of vigorously increasing iron production, the county party committee transferred 5,500 laborers from five people's communes with less abundant ore and coal resources, with 2,700 large carts and 1,200 horsepower of mechanical and electrical blower equipment, to the other five people's communes with abundant ore and coal resources to mine and smelt iron locally.

From the 15th to the 20th, in five days, the 22,000-strong army invested in mining in the county mined 25,000 tons of ore. The coal mine workers in the county worked hard day and night, basically guaranteeing the supply of coal. In these five days, a total of 223 earthen furnaces were built in the county, including 22 earthen furnaces with a daily output of 50 to 100 tons, all of which were quickly put into production.

    创造一个又一个生铁千吨县、万吨省
    只要信心大　千吨也不难
    晋城从五十跳到一千
    据山西日报消息　晋城县三十七万人民经过日夜苦战，于21日放出了全县日产生铁一千零二吨的大卫星。
    上半月，这个县的日产铁量只有五十多吨，为了迅速扭转这种落后局面，县委召开了紧急会议，决定全党全民齐动手，争取炼铁大丰收，并在南村卫星人民公社搞炼铁“试验田”，取得经验后指导全面。15日，这个人民公社的一座土方炉创造了日产铁十吨的新纪录之后，县委立即在这里召开了现场会议，及时传播了土方炉炼铁的经验，并号召全县人民运用各种土办法炼铁，保证21日产铁一千吨。会后，各人民公社都提出新的炼铁奋斗目标，社与社、厂与厂、炉与炉之间，开展了放卫星、夺红旗的竞赛。为了保证炼铁生产迅速来个大跃进，以县委第一书记刘文山为首组织了总指挥部，县委抽出四个书记和十三个委员，分别到巴东、南村、高都、城关、东沟等重点炼铁地区坐镇、督战，人民公社党委会也都抽出三分之二的委员，组成分指挥部，日夜指挥九万四千多人的钢铁大军突击炼铁，并把县直属机关抽出来的70％的干部和省、地委钢铁检查团的人员统一组织起来，实行分炉包干责任制，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，确保一斤不少、一两不短的完成产铁任务。为了保证重点炼铁地区的采矿、运输、燃料供应和技术力量能适应大力增产铁的要求，县委从五个矿石、煤炭资源不很丰富的人民公社，抽出五千五百个劳动力，带着两千七百辆大车，一千二百马力的机电鼓风设备，到矿石、煤炭资源丰富的其它五个人民公社，就地采矿、就地冶炼。
    从15日到20日的五天中，全县投入采矿的两万二千名大军，采下矿石两万五千吨，全县煤矿职工昼夜苦战，基本上保证了煤炭的供应。在这五天内，全县共建成土方炉二百二十三座，其中日产五十吨到一百吨的土方炉有二十二座，都迅速投入了生产。
