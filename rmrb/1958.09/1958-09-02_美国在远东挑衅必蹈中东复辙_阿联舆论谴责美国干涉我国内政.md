Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 31st - Both "Al-Gomhuria" and "Al-Shaab" newspapers stated on the 31st that the United States should be held responsible for the tense situation in the Far East.

"Al-Gomhuria" pointed out that the tension in the Far East only arose because of the United States' "abnormal" attitude, which includes ignoring facts and denying rights: the legitimate government of China has every right to exercise sovereignty over all Chinese territory, including coastal islands.

The newspaper expressed anger that China does not have a voice in the United Nations due to the attitude of the United States, because China is the largest country in the Far East and one of the world's five major powers.

"Al-Shaab" pointed out that the reason for the increasingly serious situation in the Far East is due to the United States' interference in a "purely internal affair, because this issue only concerns China."

The newspaper said that the United States' conspiracies and interference can neither change the Chinese people's attitude of liberating their remaining territory, nor change the attitude of countries determined to support China.

"Al-Shaab" expressed its belief that the United States will be defeated in the Far East, just as it was defeated in the Middle East, and that China will be victorious in liberating its lost territory.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 31st - The Damascus newspaper "Al-Nour" published an editorial today saying:
	"No matter how much the imperialists intensify their provocations, assemble fleets, strengthen their rule over Taiwan, and prolong the remaining life of the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, victory will belong to the glorious Chinese people."

It pointed out that "the unity and cooperation of all people who safeguard peace and freedom will surely defeat the imperialists."

"Al-Nour's" editorial, entitled "U.S. Provocations Against the People's Republic of China," said that just as the U.S. and British invading forces are still occupying the territories of Lebanon and Jordan, news has come from the friendly People's Republic of China confirming that U.S. imperialism is still continuing to carry out its evil plans and provocative plots to undermine world peace.

The editorial said, "However, people of all countries are certainly convinced that U.S. imperialism will certainly not succeed in continuing its provocations, and it will surely suffer new defeats."

The editorial said: "The Arab people have great respect and gratitude for the friendly Chinese people because of the heroic and admirable attitude adopted by the Chinese people and their unremitting support for the just cause of the Arabs."

The editorial emphasized that the Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan, "completely freeing this region from the dangerous war shadows that threaten world peace."

On the same day, "Al-Balad" also published a commentary condemning the United States' actions in creating tension in the Taiwan Strait and its aggressive policy in the Far East. The commentary pointed out that after suffering a complete defeat on the Chinese mainland, U.S. imperialism is attempting to continue its conspiracy of hostility towards the Chinese people by using Taiwan as a foothold. The commentary said that the United States "is not satisfied with making the Chiang Kai-shek clique a den of intimidation, conspiracy, and threat on the Chinese islands, but also wants to extend it further to the entire Far East." It pointed out that U.S. planes had taken off from Taiwan to bomb Indonesia, U.S. ships carried military supplies from Taiwan to support the Indonesian rebel group, and when the U.S. and Britain invaded Lebanon and Jordan, the Chiang Kai-shek clique supported the U.S. and British aggression.

The commentary said that the United States is attempting to "show off its power" in the Taiwan Strait. However, "showing off power is no longer effective for free countries, they have recognized imperialism, recognized U.S. interference and conspiracy." The commentary expressed its belief that the Chinese people will surely liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands.

    美国在远东挑衅必蹈中东复辙
    阿联舆论谴责美国干涉我国内政
    据新华社开罗31日电　“共和国报”和“人民报”31日都认为美国应对远东的紧张局势负责。
    “共和国报”指出，远东的紧张局势只是由于美国的“不正常”态度而产生的，这种态度包括忽视事实，否认权利：中国合法政府完全有权在包括沿海岛屿在内的全中国领土内行使主权。
    这家报纸对于中国由于美国的态度而在联合国没有发言权一事表示愤怒，因为中国是远东最大的国家，世界五大国之一。
    “人民报”指出远东局势日益严重的原因是由于美国干涉一个“纯粹属于内政的问题，因为这个问题只同中国有关”。
    这家报纸说，美国的阴谋和干涉既不能改变中国人民解放他们的其余领土的态度，也不能改变决心支持中国的各国人民的态度。
    “人民报”表示，它相信美国将在远东遭到失败，犹如它在中东遭到失败一样，中国将在解放失去的领土方面获得胜利。
    据新华社大马士革31日电　大马士革“光明报”今天发表社论说：
  “不论帝国主义者怎么加紧挑衅，集结舰队，加强对台湾的统治和延长蒋介石卖国集团的残命，胜利将属于光荣的中国人民”。
    它指出，“一切维护和平和自由的人民的团结一致和通力合作，一定会击败帝国主义者”。
    “光明报”的题为“美国对中华人民共和国的挑衅”的社论说，正当美英侵略军队仍旧占领着黎巴嫩和约旦的领土的时候，从友好的中华人民共和国又传来了消息，证实美帝国主义者仍旧在继续推行他们的罪恶计划和破坏世界和平的挑衅和阴谋。
    社论说，“但是，各国人民肯定都确信，美帝国主义在继续进行挑衅的过程中肯定不能得逞，它一定会遭到新的失败。”
    社论说：“由于中国人民所采取的英勇的、令人钦佩的态度，由于他们坚持不懈地支持阿拉伯的正义事业，阿拉伯人民对友好的中国人民极为尊敬和感激。”
    社论强调指出，中国人民决心要解放台湾，“使这个地区完全摆脱威胁世界和平的危险战争的魔影”。
    同一天，“巴拉达报”也发表评论谴责美国在台湾海峡制造紧张局势的行为和它在远东的侵略政策。评论指出，美帝国主义在中国大陆遭到彻底失败之后，又企图以台湾为立足点来继续从事敌视中国人民的阴谋。评论说，美国“还不满足于使蒋介石集团成为中国岛屿上一个恫吓、阴谋和威胁巢穴，而且还要更进一步扩及整个远东”。它指出，美国飞机曾经从台湾起飞空袭了印度尼西亚，美国船只从台湾运载了军火去接济印度尼西亚叛乱集团，当美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的时候，蒋介石集团支持了美英的侵略行为。
    评论说，美国企图在台湾海峡“炫耀威力”。但是，“炫耀威力对自由国家来说已经不再有效，它们已经认清了帝国主义，认清了美国的干涉和阴谋”。评论表示相信，中国人民一定会解放台湾和沿海岛屿。
