    Xinhua News Agency: China's first self-designed and manufactured electronic induction accelerator has been successfully trial-produced. This electronic induction accelerator has five million electron volts and was made by young teachers and students of the Department of Engineering Physics of Tsinghua University after a month of hard work. It can be used in nuclear physics to study nuclear reactions; it can be used in industrial technology departments to detect flaws in metal plates of various thicknesses; the rays it generates can be used for sterilization in the pharmaceutical and food industries, and for the treatment of various malignant tumors in medicine. Except for a small number of imported electron tubes, all other equipment for this accelerator is domestically produced.
