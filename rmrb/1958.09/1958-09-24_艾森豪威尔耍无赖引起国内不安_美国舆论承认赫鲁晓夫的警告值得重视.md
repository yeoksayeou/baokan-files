Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd dispatch: According to TASS: Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev's September 19th letter to U.S. President Eisenhower regarding the Taiwan Strait situation has received significant attention in the American press. Some newspapers have expressed unease over Eisenhower's unreasonable rejection of Khrushchev's letter and his continued adherence to a policy of war adventurism.

All New York newspapers reported on Khrushchev's letter to U.S. President Eisenhower on their front pages. The headlines reporting this news all emphasized that Khrushchev's warnings in the letter regarding actions of aggression against the People's Republic of China were serious. "The New York Times," in addition to reporting the news of the letter, also published the full text of the letter. An Associated Press reporter, in a dispatch from Washington, emphasized the following part of Khrushchev's letter: supporting the just position of the People's Republic of China regarding its own territory—Taiwan and other islands. "The New York Post" criticized Eisenhower's rude attitude in rejecting Khrushchev's letter, saying that Eisenhower's "unprovoked tantrum over this letter is unjustifiable. A large part of the world disagrees with the position we have taken... Chiang Kai-shek and his American China Lobby will clamor that recovering mainland China is a matter of life and death for them, but most of humanity will be uneasy and discouraged by the President's loss of face... Under the current circumstances, the United States has no right to act arbitrarily like a wayward child."

The newspaper pointed out, "It is said that the following insinuation by Khrushchev particularly humiliated Ike (Eisenhower), namely, that he is more of a mouthpiece for Dulles than a spokesperson for the world. People often get particularly angry when they realize that there is some basis for the accusation against them."

    艾森豪威尔耍无赖引起国内不安
    美国舆论承认赫鲁晓夫的警告值得重视
    据新华社23日讯  据塔斯社讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫19日就台湾海峡局势写给美国总统艾森豪威尔的信，在美国报界受到很大注意。有些报纸对艾森豪威尔无理地拒绝赫鲁晓夫的信并且继续坚持战争冒险政策表示不安。
    所有纽约报纸都在第一版报道了赫鲁晓夫给美国总统艾森豪威尔的信。在报道这些消息的标题中都强调指出，赫鲁晓夫在信中对侵略中华人民共和国的行动所提出的警告是严重的。“纽约时报”除了报道信的消息外，还刊登了信的全文。美联社记者发自华盛顿的报道中强调了赫鲁晓夫信的如下部分：支持中华人民共和国对待自己领土——台湾和其他一些岛屿的公正立场。“纽约邮报”抨击艾森豪威尔拒绝接受赫鲁晓夫的信件的粗暴态度说，艾森豪威尔“无端地对这一信件大发脾气，是没有什么理由可以辩解的，世界上有很大一部分国家都不同意我们所采取的立场……蒋介石和他的美国院外援华集团的人将大肆叫嚣说，夺回大陆中国是他们生死攸关的任务，但是大部分人类将对总统丢面子的表现感到不安和气馁……在当前情况下，美国是没有权利像一个任性的儿童那样随意行动的。”
    报纸指出，“据说，赫鲁晓夫的下述暗示使艾克（艾森豪威尔）特别感到屈辱，即暗示他与其说是世界的代言人，倒不如说是杜勒斯的传声筒。人们在了解对自己的指责是有某种程度的根据的时候，常常特别容易发火”。
