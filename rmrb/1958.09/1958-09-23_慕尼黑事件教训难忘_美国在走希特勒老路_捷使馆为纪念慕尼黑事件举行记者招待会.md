Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd. The Czechoslovak Embassy in China held a press conference today to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the "Munich Agreement."

    At the reception, Mr. Bernasek, the press attache of the Czechoslovak Embassy in China, said that the Czechoslovak Embassy in China is holding this press conference because the twentieth anniversary of the Munich Agreement reminds peace-loving people all over the world of many situations similar to the current world situation, and reminds them that imperialism and fascism are the most vicious enemies of all nations. Only by fighting resolutely for peace and against imperialist conspiracies can mankind be protected from the scourge of war. Today, imperialism, led by the United States, is constantly threatening countries around the world with acts of aggression and constantly attempting to impose its will on other countries. American imperialism is following Hitler's path, attempting to eliminate the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and establish imperialist rule throughout the world.

    Bernasek said that on the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the Munich betrayal, it is a great joke that US President Eisenhower, in his recent speech, attempted to compare ending US aggression and recognizing the People's Republic of China with the Munich Agreement. If Eisenhower is referring to Munich, then he is slapping himself in the face. Hitler once clamored to the world for living space, so he wanted to seize Norway, and even the Ural Mountains and the Middle East. Eisenhower is following his example by talking about "vital interests," claiming that the United States has vital interests in Lebanon, Taiwan, and Kinmen, thousands of miles away from its own borders.

    Bernasek pointed out that today, on the twentieth anniversary of the "Munich Agreement," it is worth noting that West German imperialism and militarism, cultivated by Western powers, are on the rise close to the Czechoslovak border. The West German army has begun nuclear armament, which has created a new source of war in Europe, threatening the security of the Soviet Union and socialist countries. The Czechoslovak Republic firmly defends the western border of the socialist camp, just as the People's Republic of China firmly defends its eastern border. They closely safeguard world peace and resolutely repel any attempts at aggression.

    慕尼黑事件教训难忘
    美国在走希特勒老路
    捷使馆为纪念慕尼黑事件举行记者招待会
    新华社22日讯　捷克斯洛伐克驻华大使馆为纪念“慕尼黑事件”二十周年，在今天举行记者招待会。
    捷驻华大使馆新闻专员伯尔纳舍克在招待会上说，捷驻华大使馆举行这次记者招待会，是由于慕尼黑事件的二十周年纪念使全世界爱好和平的人民记起了许多与当前世界局势相类似的情况，并提醒他们，帝国主义和法西斯主义是各民族的最凶恶的敌人。只有为和平、为反对帝国主义阴谋作坚决的斗争，才能保障人类免遭战祸。今天以美国为首的帝国主义正在不断以侵略行动威胁着世界各国，不断地企图以自己的意志强加在各国的头上。美帝国主义正走着希特勒的道路，企图消灭苏联和其他社会主义国家，在全世界建立帝国主义统治。
    伯尔纳舍克说，在这慕尼黑出卖的二十周年即将到来的时候，美国总统艾森豪威尔在他不久前发表的演说中，竟企图把结束美国侵略以及承认中华人民共和国与慕尼黑事件联系起来作比较，这实在是个大笑话。艾森豪威尔若是联系到慕尼黑，那他就是自打耳光。希特勒曾向世界叫嚷过要求生活的空间，因而他要夺取挪威，以至于乌拉尔山脉和中东。艾森豪威尔学他的样子在扯什么切身利益，据说美国在远离自己边疆几千里之外的黎巴嫩、台湾和金门有切身利益。
    伯尔纳舍克指出，今天在纪念“慕尼黑事件”二十周年时，值得注意的是，紧靠着捷克斯洛伐克边境，由西方大国培植起来的西德帝国主义和军国主义正在抬头。西德的军队开始了原子武装，这就产生了欧洲新战争的策源地，威胁苏联和社会主义国家安全。捷克斯洛伐克共和国坚定地守卫着社会主义阵营的西部边境，就像中华人民共和国坚定地守卫着它的东部边境一样，他们严密地保卫着世界和平，坚决击退任何侵略的企图。
