　　More than Two Hundred Jin of Taro
    Recently, the Shizhu Second Cooperative of Xihu Township, Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, dug up a nest of taro weighing a net total of 250 jin, which took three cooperative members half a day to dig up completely. This nest of taro was planted by the side of the field in front of cooperative member Wu Yinchu's house. The main reasons for the high yield were deep plowing to a depth of five chi and heavy fertilization.

　　两百多斤重的芋头
    四川江津县西湖乡石柱二社最近挖出一窝芋头，净重二百五十斤，由三个社员挖了半天才挖完。这窝芋头是种在社员吴银初屋前田角上的。高产的主要原因，是深耕五尺和多施肥。
