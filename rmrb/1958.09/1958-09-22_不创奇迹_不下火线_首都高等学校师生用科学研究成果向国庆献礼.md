Not Creating Miracles, Not Leaving the Front Line
Teachers and Students of Universities and Colleges in the Capital Use Scientific Research Achievements to Dedicate to National Day

(Our reporter Zhu Bin reports) To present their own "satellites" as a gift for National Day! Teachers and students of universities and colleges in the capital have launched a mass movement for large-scale scientific research. At present, nearly ten thousand research topics have been completed, of which more than two thousand are in the field of cutting-edge technology. There are also more than two thousand in the field of social sciences, and some important research projects are being accelerated, all striving to be completed before "October 1st."

The closer it gets to "October 1st," the greater the enthusiasm of teachers and students. Their slogan is "Seize every minute and second," and they will not leave the front line until the "satellite" is completed. Many school party committee leaders, teachers, and students have moved their luggage to workshops and laboratories. At night, the classrooms, factories, and laboratories of each school are brightly lit, but there are few people in the dormitories. Some school party committees and general branches have established scientific research headquarters. Some schools have organized special shock teams according to the key issues of each project, with the party branch secretary taking the lead, and organizing designers, process engineers, and inspectors, all staffed by teachers and students, into one team to facilitate the simultaneous resolution of related issues. Administrative staff not only deliver materials to the workshops but also deliver meals to these warriors attacking the scientific fortress.

Now, no matter which school you go to, you will feel that it is a "Grand View Garden" full of scientific flowers. Everything in cutting-edge science and technology can be seen here. For example, in the field of atomic energy, there are five types of accelerators. As for the achievements in radio electronics, in addition to more than a dozen special electronic tubes, there are analog electronic computers and relatively large general-purpose fast electronic computers. There are also program automatic control machine tools controlled by electronic computers. In the field of semiconductors, there are even more fruitful results, including the latest diodes, triodes, and various semiconductor instruments.

Research results that directly serve current production are even more dazzling and blooming. Serving the steel marshal are rapid exploration methods for iron ore, new smelting technologies for maximizing the efficiency of indigenous blast furnaces, indigenous steelmaking methods, and steel water analysis methods that are simple and double the efficiency. In the field of mechanical manufacturing, a civil aircraft with a large payload and low fuel consumption is undergoing test flights, there is an automated hydraulic coal mining machine for coal mining, which is undergoing trial production in coal mines, and there is a miniature car that uses alcohol as fuel and automatically shifts gears.

These completed or soon-to-be-completed research results, in terms of quality, have mostly reached a relatively high level. In terms of speed, many are even world miracles. The vast majority of these projects have been completed in the most recent month or so, and some large, complex, and precise projects have taken no more than three and a half months at most. The relatively large general-purpose fast electronic computer manufactured by Peking University took only fifty days from design to successful manufacture. The 700,000-volt electrostatic accelerator, which some bourgeois experts spent five years to make in the past, was made by six young students in just over forty days. Even more projects were successfully researched in three to five days. Are the equipment conditions in various universities good? No, the equipment in the laboratories here is not complete, and there are no modern factories. The vast majority are completed with hand tools and self-made indigenous machines. For example, the large dome shell of the high-voltage electrode on the electrostatic accelerator is processed by special machine tools abroad, but the six students in the Physics Research Office of Peking University made it with a few wooden mallets. Are these people's scientific and theoretical levels high? No, the main force here is, in the eyes of some old experts, just "poor and blank" young students. So why are there such brilliant achievements? A student at Peking University said it well: "In the past, we thought that scientific research could not be done without old experts, but now we know that scientific research cannot be done without the Party." The fundamental reason lies in the leadership of the Party, and the Party relies on the masses, relies on teachers and also relies on students, relying on everyone who can be relied on, encouraging them to promote them to break superstitions, and give play to their subjective initiative under the correct direction. Because they have the leadership of the Party, have the correct direction, and have the collective wisdom, they have greater courage to deal with all difficulties.

### 不创奇迹　不下火线  首都高等学校师生用科学研究成果向国庆献礼

    不创奇迹　不下火线
    首都高等学校师生用科学研究成果向国庆献礼
    本报讯　记者朱彬报道：拿出自己的“卫星”向国庆献礼！首都高等学校师生掀起了大搞科学研究的群众运动，目前已完成的研究题目有近一万多项，其中尖端技术科学领域的有二千多项。社会科学领域里的也有二千多项，还有些重要研究项目正在加紧进行，都争取在“十一”前完成。
    时间越迫近“十一”，师生们的干劲也越大。他们的口号是“分秒必争”，不完成“卫星”决不下火线。不少学校的党委负责人和教师、学生都把行李搬到了车间、试验室。入夜，每个学校的教室大楼、工厂、实验室都是灯光辉煌，宿舍里却人影寥寥。有的学校党委、总支成立了科学研究的指挥部。有的学校按照各个项目的关键问题组织了专门突击队，党支部书记挂帅，把由师生担任的设计员、工艺员、检验员全组织在一个队里，便于几方面有关的问题同时解决。行政部门的工作人员不但把材料送到车间，还把饭食送到这些攻打科学堡垒的战士面前。
    现在无论走到哪个学校，都会感到这里是一座开满了科学之花的“大观园”。尖端科学技术中各方面的东西都可以在这里看到。譬如原子能方面的加速器，这里就有五种，属于无线电电子学方面的战果，除了有十多种的特殊电子管外，有模拟电子计算机，还有比较大型的通用快速电子计算机。还有用电子计算机控制操作的程序自动控制机床。属于半导体方面的更是成果累累，有最新式的二极管、三极管，有各项半导体的仪器。
    直接为当前生产服务的研究成果，更是琳琅满目百花怒放。为钢元帅服务的有请铁矿出山的快速勘探方法，有发挥土高炉最大效能的新冶炼技术，有土炼钢法，还有方法简便效率提高两倍的钢水分析法。属于机械制造方面的，一架载重量大而耗油率小的民用飞机正在试飞，有供采煤用的自动化的水力采煤机，在煤矿里进行着试生产，还有用酒精作燃料、自动换挡的微型汽车。
    这些已经完成的研究成果或即将全部完成的成果，从质量上来看，多数达到了相当高的水平。从速度上来说，很多更是世界上的奇迹。这些项目绝大多数都是在最近一个多月的时间里完成的，一些大型、复杂精密的项目，最多也不超过三个半月的时间。北京大学所制造的比较大型的通用快速电子计算机，从设计到制造成功也只五十多天。像七十万电子伏特的静电加速器过去有些资产阶级专家花了五年时间才制成，而六个青年学生只用了四十多天时间。三天五天研究成功的项目就更加多了。是不是各个大学里的设备条件好呢？不是的，这里实验室的设备并不齐全，也没有现代化的工厂，绝大多数是靠手工工具和自己创造的土机器完成的。譬如静电加速器上高压电极的圆顶大外壳，国外是用特殊机床加工的，而北京大学物理研究室的六个学生是凭着几把木鎯头做出来的。是不是这些人的科学理论水平高呢？也不是的，这里的主力军在一些老专家看来不过是“又穷又白”的青年学生。到底为什么有这样辉煌的成绩呢？北京大学有一个学生说的好：“过去我们以为科学研究没有旧专家不行，现在才知道搞科学研究离了党不行”。根本原因就在党的领导，而党又是依靠了群众，依靠了教师也依靠了学生，依靠一切可以依靠的人，鼓励他们推动他们破除迷信，在正确的方向下发挥自己的主观能动性。因为他们有了党的领导，有了正确的方向，又有集体的智慧就有了更大的勇气对付一切困难。
