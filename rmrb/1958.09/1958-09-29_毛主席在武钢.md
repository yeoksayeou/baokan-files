On September 13th, Chairman Mao came to Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) to see their first batch of molten iron produced, and met with more than three thousand people in front of the tapping platform.

That day, workers climbed to the top of the furnace, more than seventy meters high, early in the morning to plant a large red flag. Around two o'clock in the afternoon, Chairman Mao arrived at the Jiangjiadun Wharf of WISCO by boat. He was greeted ashore by Li Yiqing, the Secretary of the WISCO General Party Committee and General Manager, and others, and then traveled by car to the factory area.

(I)

Chairman Mao first went to the General Manager's office in the front area of the factory to rest. This was a low, thin-walled bungalow, furnished only with a few rattan chairs and a desk with a switchboard telephone. It felt quite crowded with more than ten people inside. Chairman Mao sat down and asked, "When will the iron be tapped?" Deputy General Manager Han Ningfu replied, "Around 3:30." "Are you confident?" "Ninety-nine percent confident, but there may be unexpected contingencies. We estimate there won't be any major problems." Chairman Mao smiled and said, "Good. If I don't see it today, I'll come again tomorrow. If I don't see it tomorrow, I'll come again later. In short, I will make three visits to the thatched cottage to see you tap iron."

At this time, Comrade Han Ningfu pulled open the curtain of the general layout map of the factory area on the wall and reported on the situation of each component of the plant to Chairman Mao. When introducing the mine, Chairman Mao said, "Your mine contains a lot of copper, how much do you produce annually?" Comrade Li Yiqing answered with a figure. Chairman Mao smiled and said, "It seems that your iron and steel company should be called the iron, steel, and copper company." When introducing that the coking process could recover more than two hundred kinds of products, Chairman Mao asked, "How many kinds do you recover?" Comrade Han Ningfu replied, "We recover eleven kinds, including ammonium sulfate (fertilizer), crude benzene, naphthalene..." Chairman Mao immediately interjected, "How is your ammonium sulfate? You should produce more of it." "Our first coke oven produces ten tons a day, and we will increase it to twenty tons in the future." Comrade Han Ningfu then explained that after they recovered eleven kinds, other chemical factories would refine more than one hundred and eighty kinds. Chairman Mao repeated his opinion, "You can also recover them, you should do more of it. Such a large enterprise like yours should run some chemical industries, some mechanical industries, some building materials industries, and run all kinds of industries to become a joint enterprise."

Chairman Mao finally listened to the introduction of No. 1 blast furnace, which was more than seventy meters high, twelve meters in diameter, and produced more than two thousand tons of pig iron per day, and said with satisfaction: "Yours is different from ordinary blast furnaces, it should be called a big, big blast furnace." He also said to Comrade Han Ningfu, who had answered some technical questions, "You have become an expert!" Comrade Han Ningfu immediately replied, "I only learned a little common sense during construction. If the Chairman asks a few more 'whys', I won't be able to answer."

(II)

At this time, it was one minute to three o'clock. More than three thousand people gathered in the square in front of the tapping platform. The furnace workers, wearing ancient warrior-like work clothes and hats, were pushing the latest electric opening machine towards the scorching furnace opening. Suddenly, a burst of warm applause and cheers rang out from the stage. Chairman Mao had arrived at No. 1 blast furnace!

Accompanied by Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Li Yiqing, Chairman Mao slowly walked past the excited crowd, stopping from time to time to nod and wave to the masses.

Chairman Mao strode onto the tapping platform, first shook hands with the Soviet experts who had worked hard to help build WISCO, and then shook hands with the advanced producers who had made contributions to the construction of WISCO. The advanced producers excitedly held Chairman Mao's big hands with both hands and said, "Chairman Mao, hello!" Chairman Mao replied to each of them, "Hello!" "Good health to you!"

Chairman Mao finally climbed onto a small platform temporarily set up on top of the furnace workers' rest room, stood by the railing, and waved to meet the more than three thousand people. At this time, the cheers of the audience were louder than the roar of the wind beside the furnace and louder than the roar of the machines.

Chairman Mao beckoned the advanced producers to sit beside him, and even handed Han Xi (a well-known director of a blast furnace construction site known for his in-depth connection with the masses) a cigarette.

(III)

Badurov, the leader of the Soviet expert group helping WISCO construction, and Grigoryan, the chief designer, and four others, came to greet Chairman Mao. Their first sentence was: "The tapping of the blast furnace is a victory. Greet Chairman Mao with this victory." Chairman Mao replied, "Thank you." And invited them to sit down. Comrade Badurov then explained, "The imperialists said that WISCO's blast furnace would not be able to produce iron in 1958, but we are producing iron today. This is a victory." Chairman Mao said, "This is a victory for cooperation between China and the Soviet Union."

Comrade Badurov enthusiastically introduced the situation of the blast furnace to Chairman Mao. He said, "No. 3 blast furnace is bigger than this one." Chairman Mao asked, "What about No. 4?" Comrade Badurov said, "No. 4 is even bigger than No. 3." He continued, "WISCO is a very large steel plant. WISCO is going to build eight 500-ton open-hearth furnaces, and such large open-hearth furnaces are only available in the Soviet Union with three, and the United States with two."

At this time, the furnace workers used six bottles of oxygen to burn open the furnace opening, creating a new record for opening and tapping the large blast furnace. Immediately, a burst of golden sparks sprayed out of the furnace, and a flame several feet long shot out. People on the platform shouted, "Iron is coming out!" Chairman Mao stood up with everyone to watch the first batch of molten iron come out. Chairman Mao had just asked where the molten iron was flowing and how long it would take to come out when the molten iron rushed out of the furnace, raising a red light in front of the platform. The hard work of construction had blossomed and borne fruit! Cheers rang out on and off the platform.

The first batch of iron did not take long to come out. After watching it, Chairman Mao asked the advanced producers beside him, "How often do you tap iron?" Everyone said, "Every four hours." He hesitated for a moment and said to Comrade Li Yiqing, "Let's go to the front to take a look, so we can see it more clearly." He went down to the tapping platform, carefully looked at the molten iron emitting flames near the electric mud gun, shook hands with a worker who was working, and then walked along the railing on the edge of the tapping platform towards the bottom of the platform.

(IV)

Chairman Mao then took a car to see the coke production. On the way, Wang Renzhong and Comrade Li Yiqing talked about the construction of the living welfare area. Chairman Mao asked, "How is your commune situation? Such a large enterprise should have workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers." Comrade Wang Renzhong calculated and said, "We have workers, merchants also have supply points, students have technical schools, and soldiers are easy to handle, but we lack agriculture. We can delineate some agricultural cooperatives to bring in." Chairman Mao nodded and said, "It should be more comprehensive."

When Chairman Mao arrived at the coking plant, the well-informed masses had already gathered there spontaneously, applauding and cheering.

Chairman Mao was very interested to hear that this coke oven had sixty-five holes, and started counting from the beginning, one, two, three, up to the fifth hole, where it was blocked by the fire rack car. Chairman Mao asked, "How much coke does this furnace produce in a day?" Comrade Han Ningfu said, "Yesterday it had already produced more than 1,600 tons. Its design capacity is more than 1,200 tons."

At this time, the red-hot coke was pushed out through the fire rack car and fell on the quenching car like a wall collapsing. The quenching car immediately drove to the extinguishing tower, and the cold groundwater immediately extinguished the fire, and a white smoke rose from the top of the tower. Everyone continued to introduce: "After the coke is extinguished, it is poured into the coke pool next to the small house in front, and sent to the blast furnace through a belt conveyor."

Chairman Mao was deeply interested in this spectacular scene. He asked, "How often does it come out?" Everyone said, "It comes out on average every nine minutes." He looked at his watch and said, "Okay, let's watch it a second time." Chairman Mao also turned around and said to Zeng Xisheng, the First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China who was present, "Do you have such coke ovens there?" Comrade Zeng Xisheng said, "No." Chairman Mao said, "You should also have them."

(V)

Chairman Mao has left WISCO, and WISCO is still boiling!

Some advanced producers were surrounded by workers, who wanted them to tell them every detail of shaking hands and meeting with Chairman Mao.

That night, the workers and staff of WISCO's various units spontaneously gathered to discuss how to repay Chairman Mao's concern, and posted hundreds and thousands of letters of determination. The Su Shouxin group, responsible for electrical installation, guaranteed to install a set of the most complex electrical control panel in seven days and seven nights, while this kind of equipment used to take two and a half months to install at Anshan Iron and Steel. Jiang Qidou, a concrete worker who had worked a night shift the day before, went on stage to meet Chairman Mao during the day, and then went back to work an afternoon and an all-nighter. The construction site cadres advised him to go back to sleep, but he said, "I can't sleep! I saw Chairman Mao, and I'm not tired anymore."

On the afternoon of the 14th, all the workers and staff of WISCO selected several representatives to give Chairman Mao the iron screen of the panoramic view of the blast furnace, which they had cast with the first batch of molten iron. They also wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, expressing their intention to respond to the Chairman's concern for WISCO with practical actions, and reporting on the normal production of No. 1 blast furnace. They assured the Chairman:

"We will ensure that we produce 210,000 tons of iron by the end of the year, and strive to reach and exceed 230,000 tons. In short, we must go all out, take all measures, improve and improve again, and increase production and increase production again!"

    毛主席在武钢
    本报记者  曹葆铭
    9月13日，毛主席到武钢看他们出第一炉铁水来了，并在出铁台前同三千多群众见了面。
    那天，工人们一大早就爬上七十多公尺高的炉顶去，插上了一面大红旗。下午两点来钟，毛主席乘船到了武钢蒋家墩码头，由武钢总党委书记兼总经理李一清等一行人迎接上岸，乘车前往厂区。
    （一）
    毛主席先到厂前区总经理办公室休息。这是一间低矮的薄壁小平房，只摆了几把藤椅和一张办公桌，桌上有部调度电话；十多人在里面就显得相当拥挤。毛主席坐了下来，问道：“什么时候出铁？”副总经理韩宁夫回答说：“三点半左右。”“有没有把握？”“有百分之九十九的把握，但也可能有预料不到的万一，估计是没多大问题。”毛主席笑了笑说：“好呀。今天看不到，我明天再来。明天看不到，我以后还来。总而言之，我三顾茅庐也要看到你们出铁。”
    这时，韩宁夫同志将壁上的厂区总平面图的幕布拉开，向毛主席汇报全厂各个组成部分的情况。在介绍到矿山的时候，毛主席说：“你们矿里的铜也含的不少嘛，年产多少？”李一清同志回答了一个数字，毛主席笑着说：“看来，你们这个钢铁公司应该叫做钢铁铜公司。”介绍到炼焦能回收二百多种产品时，毛主席又问：“你们回收多少种？”韩宁夫同志答道：“我们回收十一种，有硫铵（肥田粉）、粗苯、萘……”毛主席马上插话：“你们的硫铵怎样？应该多生产些。”“我们第一个焦炉一天产十吨，将来要提高到二十吨。”韩宁夫同志接着又说明，他们回收十一种后，再由别的化学工厂提炼出一百八十多种。毛主席又重复他的意见说：“你们也可以回收，应该多搞些。你们这样大的企业，应该办点化学工业，办点机械工业，办点建筑材料工业，各种工业都办点，办成联合企业。”
    毛主席最后听了一号高炉有七十多公尺高、十二公尺直径粗、日产两千多吨生铁的介绍，满意地说：“你们这跟一般的高炉不同，应该叫大大高炉。”他还对解答了一些技术问题的韩宁夫同志说：“你成了专家啦！”韩宁夫同志马上回答说：“我只是在建设中学了一点常识。主席再问几个为什么，我就答不上来了。”
    （二）
    这时，差一分钟三点。出铁台前的广场上聚集了三千多人。穿戴着古代武士般的工作衣帽的炉前工们，正将最新式的电动开口机推向灼人的炉口，台下突然响起一阵热烈的鼓掌和欢呼声。毛主席到一号大高炉来了！
    毛主席在中共湖北省委第一书记王任重和李一清同志陪同下，缓缓地从激动的人群前面走过，并且不时地停下来，向群众点头招手。
    毛主席大踏步地跨上了出铁台，首先同辛勤地帮助武钢建设的苏联专家们一一握手，然后又同在武钢建设中立下功劳的先进生产者们一一握手。先进生产者们都激动地双手捧住毛主席的大手说：“毛主席，您好！”毛主席都一一回答说：“你们好！”“你们身体好！”
  毛主席最后登上了临时在炉工休息室顶上设立的小平台，站在栏杆边上同三千多群众招手见面。这时，全场的欢呼声，比炉旁的风吼声还大，比机器的轰鸣还响。
    毛主席招呼先进生产者们在他身旁坐下，还递给韩喜（以深入联系群众而著名的高炉工地主任）一枝烟。
    （三）
    帮助武钢建设的苏联专家组长巴杜洛夫和设计总负责人格里高里扬等四人，向毛主席问好来了。他们头一句就说：“高炉的出铁是个胜利。以这个胜利来问候毛主席。”毛主席回答说：“谢谢你们。”并请他们坐下。巴杜洛夫同志跟着又解释说：“帝国主义说我们武钢这个高炉1958年出不了铁，但我们今天就出铁了。这是一个胜利。”毛主席说：“这是中苏两国合作的胜利。”
    巴杜洛夫同志热情地向毛主席介绍高炉的情况。他说：“三号高炉比这个炉子大。”主席问：“第四号呢？”巴杜洛夫同志说：“四号又比三号大。”他还接着说：“武钢是个非常大的钢铁厂。武钢要建设八个五百吨的平炉，而这样大的平炉，全世界只苏联有三个，美国有两个。”
    这时，炉前工们用六瓶氧气将炉口烧开了，创造了大高炉开炉出铁的新纪录。炉内立即喷出一阵金星火花，又射出一道几尺长的烈火。台上的人叫了声：“快出铁了！”毛主席便和大家一道站起来观看出第一炉铁水。毛主席刚问了问铁水流到哪里和出多长时间，铁水就从炉内冲了出来，在台前升起一道红光。辛勤的建设开花结果了！台上台下响起一片欢呼。
    头炉铁出的时间不长。毛主席看后，问身旁的先进生产者们：“隔多长时间出一次铁？”大家说：“四个小时。”他犹豫了一下，向李一清同志讲：“到前面去看看，看得更清楚些。”他下到出铁台来，到电动泥炮附近仔细看了看冒着火光的铁水，同正在工作的一个工人握了握手，便沿着出铁台边上的栏杆，向台下走去。
    （四）
    毛主席又乘车去看焦炉生产。路上，王任重和李一清同志谈到生活福利区的建设问题，毛主席问道：“你们办公社的情况怎样？这样大的企业，应该工农商学兵都有。”王任重同志算了算说：“工是有了，商也有供应点，学有技术学校，兵也好办，就是缺点儿农业。可以划点农业社进来。”毛主席点了点头说：“应该全面些。”
    毛主席到达炼焦厂时，消息灵通的群众已经自动聚集在那里鼓掌欢呼了。
    毛主席听说这个焦炉有六十五孔，很有兴趣地从头数起，一、二、三，数到第五孔便被火架车挡住了。毛主席问道：“这个炉子一天出多少焦炭？”韩宁夫同志说：“昨天已出到一千六百多吨。它的设计能力是一千二百多吨。”
    这时，通红的焦炭穿过火架车推了出来，像墙壁倒坍一样倒在消火车上，消火车马上开到灭火塔下，冰凉的地下水立即将火扑灭，在塔顶上冒出一阵白色浓烟。大家还继续介绍说：“焦炭熄灭后，就倒在前面小屋旁边的焦池里，通过皮带机送到高炉去。”
    毛主席给这个壮观的场面引起了浓厚的兴趣。他问：“多少时间出一次？”大家说：“平均九分钟出一次。”他看了看手表，说：“好呀，再看第二次。”毛主席还转过身来，向在场的中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣说：“你们那里有没有这样的焦炉？”曾希圣同志说：“没有。”毛主席说：“你们也应该有。”
    （五）
    毛主席离开武钢了，武钢还在沸腾中！
    一些先进生产者都被工人们包围起来，要他们一字不漏地讲同毛主席握手见面的经过。
    那天晚上，武钢各单位的职工都自动集会讨论怎样报答毛主席的关怀，贴出了成百上千张决心书。负责电器安装的苏守信小组，保证将一套最复杂的电气操纵盘七天七夜安装好，而这种设备过去在鞍钢安装了两个半月。头天夜里干了一个夜班的混凝土工人姜其斗，白天上台见了毛主席，接着又回去干了一个下午和一个通宵。工地干部劝他回去睡觉，他说：“我睡不着啊！我见了毛主席，就不累了。”
    14日下午，武钢全体职工选派了几位代表，将他们用第一炉铁水铸成的高炉全景的铁屏，送给了毛主席。他们还写了封信给毛主席，信中表达了他们将用实际行动来回答主席对武钢的关怀的心意，报告了一号大高炉正常生产的情况。他们向主席保证：
    “我们到年底确保出铁二十一万吨，力争达到并超过二十三万吨。总之一定鼓足干劲，采取一切办法，提高再提高，增产再增产！”
