Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 2nd: TASS Moscow, September 2nd: American prominent social activist Eaton, who is visiting Moscow, said to a reporter from the Soviet "Labor Newspaper" that normalizing the economic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union is not only a hope but also entirely possible.

Eaton's interview was published in today's "Labor Newspaper." Eaton said that the days of achieving certain success in this regard are coming soon. It is only necessary to eliminate some misunderstandings between our two countries. Once these misunderstandings are eliminated, the difference in national systems and social systems will become irrelevant in the economic cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. As an industrialist, I believe that the greatest honor for me is to trade with Soviet Russia.

Referring to the American behavior in Lebanon, Eaton pointed out that he has always disagreed with this policy.

Eaton expressed his views on the issue of Chiang Kai-shek's elements illegally occupying seats in the United Nations. He emphasized that the United Nations should have representatives from the People's Republic of China, not representatives from Formosa. Eaton also believes that the entire American policy towards the People's Republic of China is incorrect. He is deeply convinced that China has a bright future.

Eaton also talked about the Soviet rocket carrying two dogs launched to an altitude of 450 kilometers. He emphasized that this is one of the greatest achievements of mankind.

    美国著名社会活动家伊顿说
　　中国前途美好　美国政策错误
    新华社2日讯　塔斯社莫斯科2日讯：正在莫斯科访问的美国著名社会活动家伊顿向苏联“劳动报”记者发表谈话时说，使美苏两国经济关系正常化的事不仅只是希望，而且是完全可能做到的。
    伊顿的这篇谈话刊登在今天出版的“劳动报”上。伊顿说，在这方面获得一定成就的日子很快就要来到了。只要消除我们两国之间的某些误会就行。一旦消除了这些误会，国家制度和社会制度的不同在美苏两国的经济合作方面便成了无关重要的了。作为一个工业家，我认为对我来说最大的荣幸就是同苏维埃俄罗斯进行交易。
    谈到美国在黎巴嫩的行为时，伊顿指出，他一向就不赞成这种政策。
    伊顿就蒋介石分子在联合国窃据非法席位的事情发表了自己的看法。他强调指出，在联合国中应当有中华人民共和国的代表，而不是福摩萨的代表。伊顿还认为美国对中华人民共和国的整个政策都是不正确的。他深信中国的前途是美好的。
    伊顿还谈到载了两只狗的苏联火箭发射到四百五十公里高空这件事。他强调指出，这是人类最伟大的成就之一。
