    Glass, in people's minds, is a very fragile thing.
    Is it possible to allow glass to maintain its transparency while also becoming more durable? Yes. Fiberglass is a type of glass that is even stronger than steel.
    Although there are many types of glass, they are generally silicates. The solid ingredients of these salts are melted into a liquid in a crucible, the scum is removed, and then it is pressurized through a spinneret made of platinum alloy, which turns it into very fine glass fibers. It is soft and smooth, and like other fibers, it can be woven into cloth, which is fiberglass cloth. A glass fiber thinner than a hair has a strength three or four times greater than that of nylon, the strongest of textile fibers.
    However, such glass fibers and fabrics are not ideal for practical use. Because it is thin and delicate, it cannot be made into huge objects. It is like bricks, which, though hard, must be glued together to become a wall.
    What can be used to bind glass fibers together? After searching around, people finally found plastic. There are many types of plastics, but they are not mysterious. Bakelite, commonly used in electrical components, is one type of plastic. Its scientific name is phenolic resin.
    Before it becomes Bakelite, phenolic resin has a transition phase. This substance can be dissolved in a solvent. The glass fiber or fiberglass cloth is soaked in this solution, dried, and then layered on top of each other. Finally, they are pressed together under high temperature and pressure. This creates a very solid whole – fiberglass.
    Originally, the molecules of the phenolic resin's transitional product are arranged in lines and can move around freely, like threads, so they are called linear molecules. After heating, the molecules connect with each other and can no longer move freely, becoming a network of molecules. Therefore, it has a very high degree of firmness.
    In addition to its high strength, fiberglass has many other advantages: Fiberglass is very light. Not to mention that steel cannot compare to it, even aluminum, the lightest of metals, is about twice as heavy. Therefore, it is very suitable for use in high-speed transportation tools, such as aircraft tail fins, automobile bodies, and small motorboat hulls.
    Easy processing is another advantage of fiberglass. Because it has plasticity, it can be easily made into huge models and shaped into various desired objects, saving riveting procedures like those used with metal.
    A high degree of widespread insulation is the fourth characteristic of fiberglass. It is not only electrically insulating, but also has strong resistance to heat, sound, general chemicals, and atmospheric changes. Therefore, it is used as a material in some modern machines and equipment (such as radar telecommunications industry, automobile manufacturing industry, chemical industry, radio manufacturing, etc.). If fiberglass is used to build houses instead of bricks and tiles, because it is soundproof and heat-insulating, it will not only be warm in winter and cool in summer, but also allow one to work quietly without being disturbed by the outside world.
    Because of these characteristics, fiberglass is listed as a cutting-edge technology. Not long ago, Shanghai, Beijing and other places successively manufactured fiberglass successfully. This is another major victory for the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party in their march toward modern cutting-edge science.

### 比钢还硬的玻璃

    比钢还硬的玻璃
    王震元
    玻璃，在人们的印象中是非常脆弱的东西。
    能不能让玻璃保持它透明的优点同时又变得更坚硬一些呢？能。玻璃钢就是一种比钢还坚实的玻璃。
    玻璃的种类虽多，但大体都是硅酸盐类。把这些盐类的固体配料放在坩锅中熔化成液体，除去浮渣，然后加压通过铂合金做的喷丝嘴，就变成了很细的玻璃纤维。它柔软而光滑，和其他纤维一样可以织成布，这就是玻璃布。一根比头发还细的玻璃纤维，它的强力比织物纤维中强度最高的尼龙还要大上三、四倍。
    然而这样的玻璃纤维和织物在实用上不够理想。因为它细而薄，不能做成巨大的物件。好比砖头虽硬，必须把它粘合起来，才能成为一垛墙。
    用什么才能把玻璃丝粘合起来呢？人们找来找去，终于找到了塑料。塑料种类很多，但并不神秘。常用的电木就是塑料里的一种。它的科学名字叫做酚醛树脂。
    在没有成为电木以前，酚醛树脂有一个过渡阶段。这种物质可以在溶剂中溶解。把玻璃纤维或玻璃布浸透这种溶液后晒干，一层层地叠起来，最后在高温下用压力把它们压在一起。这样就成为一个非常坚实的整体——玻璃钢。
    原来酚醛树脂过渡阶段的产物的分子是排成一行一行的可以自由地跑来跑去，像线一样，所以叫做线型分子。经过加热后，分子与分子间连结起来了，不能再随意行动，变成了网状的分子。所以就具有了很高的结实度。
    玻璃钢除了强度大外还有其他不少的优点：玻璃钢很轻。不要说钢比不过它，就是轻金属中的铝也要比它重一倍左右。因此它就很适于用在高速度的运动工具上，例如飞机上的尾翼、汽车和小汽船的外壳等。
    加工方便是玻璃钢的又一优点。因为它具有可塑性，所以可以随意做成巨大的模型把它塑成各种需用的东西，而能省却像金属那样的铆接手续。
    高度的广泛绝缘性是玻璃钢的第四个特点。它不仅对电绝缘，而且对热、音、一般化学药品、大气的变化等也有很强的抵抗力。所以在一些现代化的机器和设备上（如雷达电讯工业、汽车制造工业、化学工业、收音机制造等）都要用它来做材料。假使用玻璃钢代替砖瓦来造房子，由于它隔音又隔热，所以不但是冬暖夏凉，而且可以安静地工作而不受外界的干扰。
    因为这些特点，所以玻璃钢被列入尖端技术。不久以前，上海、北京等地相继制造成功了玻璃钢。这是我国人民在党的领导下向现代尖端科学进军获得的又一重大胜利。
