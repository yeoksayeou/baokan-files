Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 18th: Indonesian workers' and women's organizations have recently demanded that U.S. troops immediately withdraw from the Taiwan area to ensure Asian peace.

The Indonesian Women's Movement Association, in a statement, representing its 650,000 members, strongly protested against U.S. interference in the Taiwan and Chinese coastal islands issue.

The Central Council of the Indonesian Railway Workers' Union recently sent a letter to U.S. Ambassador Jones, "firmly demanding that the U.S. armed forces immediately and unconditionally withdraw" from Chinese territory.

The All-Indonesia Rice and Tapioca Workers' Union also condemned U.S. military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 18th: Shurbaji, Secretary of the Damascus Mass Organizations Congress, wrote a letter to Shi Gu, the Chinese Consul General in Damascus, on the 17th, expressing his determination to vigorously support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate their own territory of Taiwan and coastal islands.

In his letter, Shurbaji, in his own name and on behalf of the Mass Organizations Congress, composed of more than 60 mass organizations representing all sectors of the city's population, expressed his willingness to provide the Chinese people with any material and moral assistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 18th: The "Today" newspaper published an editorial today saying that Taiwan is China's internal affair, and the Chinese government has the right to liberate its own territory.

Referring to the question of recognizing China, the newspaper said that, in fact, China must be recognized sooner or later, because no force can destroy its existence. The newspaper said that most countries, except the United States, are in favor of recognizing People's China.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 18th: The Deputy Mufti of Oman, Salah Harseh, said here today in a separate interview with a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "The Omani people fully support the Chinese people's struggle against the war provocations and threats launched by the United States against the People's Republic of China and to liberate their territory from the hands of U.S. imperialism and its agents. We believe that any aggression against China is aggression against us."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 18th: Prince Sise Zakaria Ibn Kainu, one of the leaders of the Mauritanian Liberation Army, said here today, "No one in Africa agrees with the presence of U.S. troops in Taiwan, because the African people have a closely related feeling for the Chinese people's heroic struggle."

The French West African nationalist leader said in an interview with a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Taiwan is part of China, and this is indisputable. Obviously, Taiwan is being used by the imperialists as a base for aggression against China. We should do everything in our power to help the Chinese people liberate Taiwan."
