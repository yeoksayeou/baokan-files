Xinhua News Agency, September 1st. Xinhua News Agency special correspondent Xu Bingzhong reports: Vice Chairman Zhu De inspected the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant today, encouraging the factory's workers to vigorously promote iron and steel production.

The person in charge of the factory told Vice Chairman Zhu that in order to produce more steel for the country, the factory decided at the end of August to work hard for half a month to build a converter steelmaking workshop with an annual output of 100,000 tons, and strive to produce 20,000 tons of steel this year. After the start of construction, almost every project was completed ahead of schedule. Now the workers at the construction site have put forward a leap forward plan to produce steel in early September. In response to the call of the Party Central Committee to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year, the construction site has decided to build three more converters before National Day, increasing steel production capacity to 250,000 to 300,000 tons, and striving to produce 40,000 tons of steel this year. Vice Chairman Zhu expressed his appreciation for the workers' revolutionary enthusiasm and inspected the construction site. The workers at the construction site were encouraged by Vice Chairman Zhu's concern and immediately launched a new competition to complete the task ahead of schedule.

Vice Chairman Zhu also inspected the factory's steelmaking, ironmaking, coking, sintering, and machinery manufacturing plant construction sites, and inquired in detail about the progress of the expansion project. He said, "You are vigorously promoting iron and steel production, which is very promising. Now there is a great leap forward all over the country, and the momentum is different. The equipment and materials needed for expansion should be ordered to meet the needs of the project. This can be done." The factory needs a large number of refractory materials, but the supply is insufficient. The workers started from scratch, found raw materials from the mountains dozens of miles away, and made a small amount of refractory bricks and refractory clay. Vice Chairman Zhu expressed his support for the workers' enthusiastic desire to rely on their own efforts to manufacture refractory materials.

At every construction site in the factory, Vice Chairman Zhu was warmly welcomed by the masses. Some workers who had finished their shifts saw Vice Chairman Zhu come to the factory to inspect their work and simply didn't go home. They continued to work, forgetting their fatigue. Hu Zhaosen, a national model worker from Anshan who came to the factory to participate in the construction of the converter steelmaking site, said, "The Party Central Committee's call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year and Vice Chairman Zhu's visit to our factory to inspect our work have greatly inspired us. We must put in more effort and seize every minute to build the converter as soon as possible and let the molten steel flow."

Vice Chairman Zhu also inspected the Beijing Steel Plant today.

　　朱副主席视察石钢
　　勉励职工大力促进钢铁生产
　　扩建工地展开了一场大竞赛
    新华社1日讯　新华社特约记者徐炳忠报道：朱德副主席今天视察石景山钢铁厂，勉励这个工厂的职工大力促进钢铁生产。
    这个工厂的负责人告诉朱副主席说，为了给国家多生产钢，工厂在8月底决定苦战半月，建成一座年产十万吨的转炉炼钢车间，争取在今年内生产出两万吨钢来。开工以后，各项工程差不多项项都提前完成了任务，现在工地的职工又提出跃进计划，9月上旬即可出钢。为了响应党中央发出的在今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的号召，工地已决定在国庆节前再增建三座转炉，使钢的生产能力增加到二十五万至三十万吨，争取今年出钢四万吨。朱副主席对职工的革命干劲表示赞许，并且视察了这个工地。工地职工为朱副主席的关怀所鼓舞，立即展开了一场提前完成任务的新竞赛。
    朱副主席还视察了这个工厂的炼钢、炼铁、炼焦、烧结和机器制造厂的工地，详细询问了扩建工程的进行情况。他说：“你们大力促进钢铁生产，很有希望，现在全国各地都在大跃进，声势又不同了，扩建需要的设备材料订货，要满足工程的需要，这是作得到的。”这个工厂需要大批耐火材料，供应不足，工人们白手起家，从数十里外的山地中找来原料，制成了少量的耐火砖、耐火土。朱副主席对职工自力更生、自己制造耐火材料的热烈愿望表示支持。
    朱副主席在这个工厂的每一个工地，都受到了群众的热情欢迎，有些下了班的职工，看见朱副主席来厂视察自己的工作，索性连家也不回去了，他们继续劳动，忘记了疲劳。从鞍山来这个工厂参加建设的全国劳动模范、转炉炼钢工地总检查胡兆森说：“党中央发出今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的号召和朱副主席来厂视察我们的工作，使我们非常振奋，我们一定要再加一把干劲，分秒必争，早日建成转炉，让钢水奔流。”
    朱副主席今天还视察了北京钢厂。
