Xinhua News Agency, 20th - The National Agricultural Implements Exhibition has closed at 6:00 PM today after completing its task of promoting the reform of agricultural implements.

The National Agricultural Implements Exhibition, which opened on May 5th, received a total of more than 550,000 visitors over the course of four and a half months. Among them, more than 45,000 were visiting delegations from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. More than half of the members of the local visiting delegations were grassroots cadres and skilled craftsmen from agricultural and handicraft cooperatives.

From the visitors' comment books and the discussions held by various visiting delegations, it is clear that the greatest gains people obtained from the exhibition were: broadening their horizons, liberating their minds, breaking down the mysterious views on mechanization and electrification, and strengthening their confidence in accelerating the realization of mechanization and electrification. The skilled craftsmen were greatly encouraged during the visit, and their enthusiasm for reforming tools was even higher. Some scientific and technical personnel, after the visit, reversed their ideas of looking down on the working people, and expressed that they wanted to take the skilled craftsmen as their teachers, combine with them, and contribute to the technological revolution.

The exhibition also directly promoted the agricultural implements reform movement in various places. The visiting delegations from various places, who visited and studied under the slogans of "learning from experience and taking treasures" and "introducing seeds from other places and blooming local flowers," worked hard at the exhibition, preparing to carry out agricultural implements reform on a large scale when they returned. In order to facilitate the imitation and promotion of various tools suitable for local use, the visiting delegations drew more than 20,000 drawings in total, and some visiting delegations even made models on the spot.

In order to meet the needs of various places to promote various excellent exhibits, according to the instructions of the central government, the National Agricultural Implements Exhibition imitated 277 kinds of tools and presented them to various provinces, cities and autonomous regions. In addition, a large number of exhibit loose-leaf materials and agricultural implement picture selections were compiled to supply the audience from all over. The exhibit loose-leaf materials alone supplied 78,000 sets to the audience (each set including drawings of 980 kinds of improved tools).

After the closing of the National Agricultural Implements Exhibition, the exhibit selection work will continue, and preparations will be made to reward inventors and improvers.

    完成促进农具改革运动的任务
    全国农具展览会闭幕
    新华社20日讯　全国农具展览会在完成了促进农具改革运动的任务之后，已在今天下午六时闭幕。
    全国农具展览会从5月5日开幕以来，在四个半月中共计接待了观众五十五万多人。其中，有四万五千多人是来自全国各省、市和自治区的参观团。各地参观团的成员，有一半以上是基层干部和农业社、手工业社的能工巧匠。
    从观众的留言簿上和各参观团的座谈讨论中看出，展览会使人们得到的最大的收获是：开阔了眼界，解放了思想，打破了对机械化、电气化的神秘观点，坚定了加速实现机械化、电气化的信心。能工巧匠们在参观中受到了极大的鼓舞，改革工具的劲头更加高涨。一些科学技术人员，参观以后，扭转了轻视劳动人民的思想，表示要拜能工巧匠为师，和他们结合起来，对技术革命作出贡献。
    展览会还直接推动了各地的农具改革运动。在“取经取宝”和“引外地之种，开本地之花”的口号下参观学习的各地参观团，都在展览会上苦钻苦学，准备回去就大搞农具改革。为了便于仿制和推广适于本地使用的各种工具，各参观团共计绘制了两万多张图样，有些参观团还当场制了模型。
    为了满足各地推广各种优良展品的需要，根据中央指示，全国农具展览会仿制了二百七十七种工具赠给了各省、市和自治区。此外，还编写了大量展品活页资料和农具图选等供应各地观众。仅展品活页资料即供应观众七万八千套（每套包括九百八十种改良工具的图样）。
    全国农具展览会闭幕以后，还将继续进行展品评选工作，准备对发明创造和改良者给予奖励。
