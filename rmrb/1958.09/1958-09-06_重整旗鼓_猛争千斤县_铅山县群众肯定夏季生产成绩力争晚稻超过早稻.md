　　Regain Momentum and Strive for a Thousand-Jin County
　　Qianshan County Masses Affirm Summer Production Achievements and Strive for Late Rice to Surpass Early Rice
　　(Our Dispatch) Reporters Ma Zhongming and Mei Guobao report: Qianshan County, Jiangxi Province, has summarized the experiences and lessons learned from early rice production. Cadres and the masses have rekindled their enthusiasm and are striving to make the late rice yield catch up with advanced areas.
　　The more than 120,000 mu of second-season late rice that has now been planted has an average per-mu yield target of 1,000 jin, as set by the agricultural cooperatives. This is more than double the early rice yield, and the people in various places are full of confidence in completing this plan.
　　Qianshan County is a semi-mountainous and semi-hilly area with less-than-ideal natural conditions. During the Great Leap Forward year, thanks to the high revolutionary drive of the broad masses of agricultural cooperative members and cadres, and by focusing on key yield-increasing aspects such as water conservancy construction, increased fertilizer application, and large-scale promotion of close planting, the average per-mu yield of 200,000 mu of early rice in the county this year leaped from 284 jin last year to 458 jin, an increase of 60%. However, this yield did not reach the predetermined target of 600 jin for the entire county, and many agricultural cooperatives also did not reach their predetermined yield targets. Especially since high-yield "satellites" from other places continued to be launched one after another, in comparison, some cadres and members did not sufficiently affirm the achievements and experiences already made in early rice, and their understanding was insufficient. Therefore, they were discouraged, slackened their efforts, and believed that "the efforts of the first half of the year were wasted," "achieving half the result with twice the effort, not worth the loss," and even said, "Our natural conditions are poor, and it is difficult to catch up with others no matter how hard we try." Coupled with the original "skeptics," "bean counters," and some people with ulterior motives spreading "recession" and "failure" remarks, people lacked confidence in continuing the Great Leap Forward and striving for a greater harvest in late rice.
　　In order to criticize this negative sentiment, the Qianshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first convened a meeting of the Party committee secretaries and general branch secretaries of various townships, and then launched debates in various agricultural cooperatives on the achievements of early rice production and the experiences and lessons learned. During the debates, members and cadres affirmed that this year's early rice harvest was unprecedented. Many members compared it with previous years, saying that in the past, even in the best years, an increase of 10% to 20% was considered the limit. If it weren't for the Great Leap Forward, how could the county have increased production by 60% at once this year, with some cooperatives even increasing production by one to nine times? In particular, this year, every agricultural cooperative has produced thousand-jin fields and thousand-jin mu. The members said, "This is something that has been shouted for several years without being realized, and now it has been realized." Therefore, the original view that "the efforts of the first half of the year were wasted" and "achieving half the result with twice the effort, not worth the loss" is unfounded.
　　In the debate on whether the failure to reach the planned target for early rice production and the failure to catch up with advanced areas was entirely due to poor natural conditions, some people used the neighboring Wuyuan County as an example. Wuyuan has high mountains and cold water, and its natural conditions are worse than those of Qianshan, but its early rice yield per mu has exceeded 800 jin. Therefore, it cannot be said that the matter is entirely determined by natural conditions. During the debate, various places used the method of comparing high-yield fields with low-yield fields and comparing the experiences of high-yield areas outside the area with local early rice, and realistically examined that the reasons for the low yield were as follows: First, early rice generally lodged this year, and the higher the yield of experimental fields, the better the seedlings grew and the more serious the lodging. After lodging, the yield was reduced by at least half, and in many cases by 80% to 90%. The cause of lodging was primarily the failure to implement deep plowing in conjunction with close planting, and the application of fertilizer was not rational enough. The large amount of fertilizer applied was nitrogen fertilizer, lacking phosphorus and potassium fertilizer; irrigation management was not timely enough. Second, rice seedlings were not transplanted according to the specifications of close planting. Each mu should have had around 32,000 seedlings, while the actual density was only over 20,000 seedlings; the number of seedlings per clump was also too small, all below seven, resulting in low tillering and branching rates. Therefore, the reduction in the total number of rice plants also affected the yield.
　　Everyone believed that these problems were mainly because this year was the first time to extensively reform the cultivation and planting system, and the leaders and the masses lacked experience, and technical measures were not followed up in time. As long as we learn from the above lessons, and at the same time further implement close planting based on the experiences of high-yield areas outside the area, the yield of rice can still be greatly improved.
　　Through debate, the achievements and experiences of early rice production have been affirmed, the shortcomings have been identified, and cadres and the masses are more clear about the direction of continuing the Great Leap Forward and striving for a bumper harvest of late rice. At this time, in addition to proposing higher late rice yield targets than early rice and ensuring that the county's late rice yield per mu achieves 1,000 jin, various townships and cooperatives have also launched a massive "three, five, ten" high-yield movement, striving for late rice yields of 3,000 jin, 5,000 jin, and over 10,000 jin per mu. Deep plowing has been universally implemented in late rice fields, generally deepening from the original three or four inches to six or seven inches. In the past, there was no habit of applying base fertilizer to late rice, but now, it is universally combined with deep plowing to apply sufficient base fertilizer in layers, with an average of over 400 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. Among them, experimental fields with yields of over 10,000 jin apply 2,000 to 3,000 dan of fertilizer per mu, and attention is paid to the rational combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium components of the fertilizer. The degree of close planting has also been increased, with each mu generally having around 30,000 to 60,000 seedlings, and the number of seedlings per clump has increased from below seven in early rice to fifteen or sixteen. Experimental fields with yields of over 10,000 jin have 900,000 seedlings per mu, with the highest reaching 3 million seedlings.
　　Now, the transplanting of late rice has ended throughout the county, and field management is being vigorously pursued.

　　重整旗鼓　猛争千斤县
    铅山县群众肯定夏季生产成绩力争晚稻超过早稻
    本报讯　记者马锺明、梅国保报道：江西省铅山县通过总结早稻生产的经验教训，干部和群众重新鼓起干劲，力争晚稻产量赶上先进地区。
    现在全县已经栽下的十二万多亩二季晚稻，由各农业社制定的计划平均亩产要求达到一千斤，超过早稻产量一倍多，各地群众对完成这个计划充满了信心。
    铅山县是个半山半丘陵的地区，自然条件不够好。在大跃进的一年，由于广大农业社员和干部发挥了高度的革命干劲，抓住了兴修水利、增施肥料和大面积推行密植等几个增产主要环节，今年全县二十万亩早稻平均每亩产量由去年的二百八十四斤，跃进到四百五十八斤，增产六成。但是，这个产量却未达到预定的全县六百斤的指标，许多农业社也未达到预定的产量指标；特别外地早稻又一个接一个的放出高产“卫星”，相形之下，部分干部和社员曾对早稻已取得的成绩和经验肯定不够，认识不足，因此自馁，泄劲，认为“上半年的力气白化了”，“事倍功半，得不偿失”，甚至说：“我们自然条件就是差，再用力气也难赶上别人”。加上原来的“怀疑派”、“算账派”和一些别有用心的人散布“促退”和“失败”言论，人们对继续跃进，争取晚稻上的更大的丰收信心不足。
    为了批判这种消极情绪，中共铅山县委首先召开了各乡党委书记和总支书记会议，继又在各个农业社中间就早稻生产的成绩以及所取得的经验教训进行了辩论。辩论中，社员和干部都肯定今年早稻的丰收是前所未有的。许多社员同往年对比说，过去碰到最好年景，增产上一两成便算顶多了，如果不是大跃进，今年全县那能一下就增产六成，有的社还增产一倍到九倍呢？特别今年每个农业社都出现了千斤田、千斤亩，社员们说：“这是过去喊了几年没有实现的，现在实现了。”因此，原来认为“上半年力气白花了”，“事倍功半，得不偿失”的看法是没有根据的。
    在辩论早稻增产未达到计划指标，未赶上先进的地区，是否完全因为自然条件差的时候，有人用邻近的婺源县为例，婺源山高水冷，比铅山自然条件还坏，早稻亩产量却超过了八百斤。因此，并不能说事情完全决定于自然条件。辩论中，各地以高产田与低产田对比、外地丰产经验与当地早稻对比的方法，实事求是地检查了产量不高有以下几个原因：第一，今年早稻普遍倒伏，而且越是高产试验田，禾苗长得越好，倒伏越严重。倒伏之后，产量最低减少一半，多的减少百分之八、九十。所以造成倒伏，首先是未能配合密植实行土地深耕，施肥不够合理，大量增施的肥料是氮肥，缺乏磷肥和钾肥；灌溉管理不够适时。第二，没有按照密植的规格插秧。每亩应该插秧三万二千蔸左右，而实际密度只二万多蔸；每蔸的秧本数也过少，都在七根以下，发棵和分蘖率低。因此，稻棵总数减少也影响到产量。
    这些问题，大家认为主要是因为今年第一次大面积改革耕作和栽培制度，领导和群众都缺少经验，技术措施未能及时跟上去带来的。只要吸取上述教训，同时根据外地丰产经验再进一步实行密植，水稻的产量还是可以大大提高的。
    通过辩论，早稻生产的成绩和经验得到了肯定，缺点找出来了，干部和群众对于继续跃进，争取晚稻丰产的方向更加明确。这时各乡社除提出比早稻更高的晚稻增产指标、保证全县晚稻亩产实现千斤以外，并且展开了一个声势浩大的“三、五、十”高额丰产运动，即争取晚稻亩产三千斤、五千斤和一万斤以上。晚稻田普遍实行了深耕，一般都由原来的三、四寸加深到六、七寸。过去晚稻没有施基肥的习惯，现在也普遍结合深耕分层施足了基肥，平均每亩施肥四百多担。其中万斤以上的试验田，每亩施肥达二三千担，并且注意了肥料氮、磷、钾成分的合理配合。密植程度也提高了，每亩插秧一般都有三万到六万蔸左右，每蔸的秧本数由早稻的七根一下增加到十五、六根。万斤以上的试验田每亩插秧有九十万蔸，最高的达三百万蔸。
    现在，全县晚稻插秧已经结束，正狠狠地抓田间管理工作。
