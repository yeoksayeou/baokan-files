    Xinhua News Agency, August 31st dispatch from Moscow, TASS: The Soviet government yesterday sent a memorandum to the U.S. government, expressing its agreement to begin negotiations with the U.S. and Britain on October 31st of this year regarding the signing of an agreement on the permanent cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing by all countries, and on establishing appropriate supervision for the implementation of this agreement.
    The memorandum pointed out that the Soviet government believes that Geneva is the most appropriate location for holding the negotiations. In order to prevent the negotiations from dragging on, the Soviet government also suggested that it be agreed in advance that these negotiations should have a definite time limit. It proposed setting this limit at two to three weeks.
    This memorandum was delivered to the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union on August 30th. Also delivered to the U.S. Embassy with the memorandum was a talk given by Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev to a "Pravda" reporter on the issue of stopping nuclear weapon testing.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 30th dispatch from Moscow, TASS: The Soviet Embassy in the United States delivered a memorandum from the Soviet government to the U.S. State Department on the 28th. In the memorandum, the Soviet government rejected the U.S.'s invitation, made a month earlier, to send Soviet observers to view an atomic weapon demonstration conducted by the U.S. government under laboratory conditions.
    The memorandum pointed out that in April of this year, the U.S. government issued an invitation to countries represented on the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, inviting them to send scientists and journalists to observe a so-called "clean" nuclear weapon explosion test conducted by the U.S. The Soviet government already expressed its views on the U.S.'s plan to perform a so-called "clean" hydrogen bomb in a statement responding to the U.S.'s invitation on May 8th. It pointed out that these plans concealed the intention to find excuses for the U.S. to continue testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, and hoped to create the illusion that these tests posed no danger to human life and health. Therefore, the Soviet government could not agree to such measures. It also called on the U.S. and British governments to no longer conduct tests of such weapons.
    The memorandum said that, however, the U.S. government did not respond to this call from the Soviet government, and is currently conducting a series of underwater, ground, and air nuclear explosions, the largest in recent years. As a result of these tests, large areas of the high seas, islands, and other regions of the Pacific Ocean have been scattered with large amounts of radioactive fallout, and the water in the ocean has been severely polluted.
    It is very clear that under these circumstances, it is difficult to believe that continuing to test U.S. atomic weapons will not threaten people's health. This is particularly illustrated by the fact that the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation recently issued a report that fully and fairly pointed out this threat.
    The Soviet government's memorandum pointed out that the U.S. government, in its memorandum of July 30th of this year, changed its previous idea and decided not to invite scientists and journalists to observe a U.S. nuclear weapon explosion on Eniwetok Island, but instead wanted to invite them to visit a nuclear weapon demonstration that released "limited" radioactive fallout under laboratory conditions.
    The memorandum pointed out that the purpose of the U.S. government's suggestion is the same as its suggestion made in April of this year, which is to find excuses for the U.S. to continue testing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and to use the prestige of the United Nations and its Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation for this purpose. Therefore, the Soviet Union cannot send observers to visit the U.S.'s performance.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 31st dispatch from New York, TASS: U.S. news agencies reported on the morning of the 30th from Newport (where the U.S. President is vacationing) a statement by White House Press Secretary Hagerty. Hagerty said that Eisenhower was "satisfied" that Khrushchev had agreed to begin negotiations on the issue of banning nuclear weapon testing on October 31st. However, Hagerty said that the U.S. President will not participate in the initial negotiations. The U.S. delegation will primarily be composed of experts.
    Hagerty said that the U.S. does not object to Geneva as the location for the negotiations. He said that whether the President will participate in the negotiations later will depend on the progress of the negotiations.

    就签订停止核试验协定问题照会美国
　　苏联同意下月底和美英谈判
    揭穿美国表演“干净”氢弹的把戏　拒绝派观察员去参观
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府昨天照会美国政府，表示同意在今年10月31日开始同美英两国就签订一项各国永远停止原子武器和氢武器试验的协定并对执行这项协定建立应有的监督的问题进行谈判。
    照会指出，苏联政府认为，日内瓦是举行谈判的最适当的地点。为了不使谈判拖延，苏联政府还建议事先谈妥，这次谈判应有一定期限的限制。它建议把这个期限规定为两个星期到三个星期。
    这项照会已经于8月30日交给美国驻苏联大使馆。同照会一起送交美国大使馆的还有苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫就停止核武器试验问题向“真理报”记者发表的谈话。
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科30日讯：苏联驻美国大使馆28日把苏联政府的一份照会送交美国国务院。苏联政府在照会中拒绝了美国一个月前提出的要求苏联派观察员去参观美国政府所拟定的在试验室条件下进行的原子武器表演的邀请。
    照会指出，今年4月美国政府向有代表参加联合国原子辐射影响科学委员会的国家发出邀请，请它们派科学家和记者去参观美国进行的一次所谓“干净的”核武器爆炸试验。苏联政府在5月8日答复美国的邀请的声明中已经对美国表演所谓“干净”氢弹的计划表示了意见，它指出，这些计划后面隐藏着为美国继续试验原子武器和氢武器寻找借口的打算，并且指望造成一种假象，似乎这些试验对人的生命和健康没有危险。因此，苏联政府不能同意这种措施。它同时呼吁美英两国政府不再进行这种武器的试验。
    照会说，但是美国政府没有响应苏联政府的这个呼吁，目前它正在进行近年来规模最大的一系列水下、地面和空中的核爆炸。由于这些试验，公海、岛屿和太平洋的其他地区的广大面积上都散布有大量的放射性微尘，大洋中的水也受到严重的污染。
    十分清楚，在这种情况下，很难认为继续试验美国的原子武器不会威胁人们的健康，特别可以说明这点的是，联合国原子辐射影响科学委员会在不久前发表的报告中已经完全公正地指出了这种威胁。
    苏联政府的照会指出，美国政府在它今年7月30日的照会中改变过去的主意，决定不邀请科学家和记者来观察恩尼威托克岛的一次美国核武器爆炸，但是却想邀请他们参观在试验室条件下放出“有限的”放射性微尘的核武器表演。
    照会指出，美国政府这个建议的目的同它在今年4月提出的建议相同，就是要为美国继续试验原子武器和氢武器寻找借口，并为此利用联合国及其原子辐射影响科学委员会的威信。因此，苏联不能派观察员去参观美国的表演。
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社纽约30日讯：美国各通讯社30日早上从新港（美国总统在那里休养）报道了白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂的声明。哈格蒂说，艾森豪威尔对赫鲁晓夫同意在10月31日开始举行关于禁止试验核武器问题的谈判“感到满意”。但是，哈格蒂说，美国总统将不参加最初的谈判。美国代表团将主要由专家组成。
    哈格蒂说，美国不反对以日内瓦作为谈判地点。他说，至于总统以后是否参加谈判，这将取决于谈判的进程。
