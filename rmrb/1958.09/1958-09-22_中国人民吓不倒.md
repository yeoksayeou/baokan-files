Since ancient times, the Chinese people have been accustomed to using the proverb "the thief cries, 'catch the thief!'" to describe the cunning and shamelessness of robbers. It can be said to be incisive and vivid. However, now, faced with the American aggressors, this inhuman and shameless robber, the proverb "the thief cries, 'catch the thief!'" is far from sufficient to express even a fraction of their behavior. "The thief cries, 'catch the thief!'" is merely a trick used by robbers to escape capture by confusing and misleading people. However, they have not dared to directly call the owner a thief. Let's see how the Americans have fantastically developed it!

The robber steals things and kills people in a peaceful and kind family. It is clear that there is blood on the murder weapon and the stolen goods are in hand. Yet, he scolds loudly, saying that the victim is a "robber," is "conquering by force," and is an "aggressor!" Readers should not forget that when the robber shouts like this, he is not standing elsewhere, but still standing in the victim's yard, on the steps inside the gate. He is asked to leave the stolen goods, put down the butcher knife, and get out immediately, but he insists on not leaving, supposedly because he is here to "defend peace"; what's worse, he not only doesn't leave, but blatantly piles firewood in the corner of the victim's house and sets it on fire, threatening the owner to vacate the house for him to live in!

Eisenhower, Dulles, and their ilk, these public enemies of human peace, have just such an ugly face and such an absurd logic. Dulles, at the United Nations General Assembly, reversed right and wrong, shamelessly threatened, and slandered the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory as an "attempt to use naked force" to "expand power," as so-called "armed aggression." You are making excuses and laying smoke screens for your preparations for a war of aggression. How can you have the thick skin to say such shameless things!

The Chinese people warmly support and firmly back Foreign Minister Chen Yi's solemn statement: If the American aggressors, disregarding the people's repeated warnings and the firm opposition of the people of the world, dare to impose war on the Chinese people, then our united 600 million people will not hesitate to sacrifice themselves and, under the sacred banner of defending the great motherland, fight to resist aggression, to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world!

History proves that the Chinese people best understand the principle of "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." In order to defend the motherland and safeguard world peace, the Chinese people fear neither heaven nor earth and have never stinted their own blood! Aggressors, don't forget this fact: the Chinese people were liberated from the oppression of many imperialist robbers for more than a century; the Chinese people, together with the Korean people, taught the American aggressors a severe lesson during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and now we are even stronger than we were then. Shameful and vicious robbers, put away your lies, put down your butcher knife, leave behind the property you have robbed, tuck your tails between your legs, and obediently get out of our yard! For you, this is the smartest thing to do, because doing so can allow you to live a few more days in the world.

    中国人民吓不倒
    马少波
    自古以来，中国人民习惯用“贼喊捉贼”的谚语，来形容强盗的狡猾和无耻，真可谓一针见血，淋漓尽致。但是，现在面对着美国侵略者这种毫无人性不要脸皮的强盗，“贼喊捉贼”的谚语，就远远不足以表达其万一了。“贼喊捉贼”，不过是强盗为了逃脱捕捉而使用的一种混淆听闻乱人耳目的手法而已，它却并没有敢直接了当地把主人说成贼；我们来看美国人是怎样异想天开地加以发挥的呢！
    强盗在一个和平善良的人家抢了东西，杀了人，明明凶刀有血，赃物在手，他却泼口大骂，说这家失主是“强盗”，是“武力征服”，是“侵略者”！读者还不要忘记，强盗这样叫嚣的时候，并不是站在别处，是仍然站在失主家的院子里，站在大门里的台阶上。让他留下赃物，放下屠刀，立即滚开，他竟坚持不滚，据说理由是为了在这里“保卫和平”；更甚者，不但不滚，反而明目张胆地在失主的屋角堆薪纵火，威胁主人腾出房子，他来住！
    艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之流这些人类和平的公敌就是这样一副丑恶的嘴脸，一套荒唐透顶的逻辑。杜勒斯在联合国大会上颠倒是非，无耻恫吓，诬蔑中国人民解放自己的领土是“企图使用赤裸裸的武力”来“扩大权力”，是所谓“武装侵略”。说他们在我国台湾海峡地区所进行的罪恶的军事侵略，反是为了维护“自由世界的和平和安全”。你们为了进行侵略战争准备，找借口、放烟幕，这种丑话，亏你们脸皮厚，说得出来！
    中国人民热烈拥护坚决支持陈毅外长的严正声明：如果美国侵略者竟然不顾人民的一再警告和世界人民的坚决反对，胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，那么，我国团结一致的六亿人民，必将不惜牺牲，在保卫伟大祖国的神圣旗帜下，为反抗侵略而战，为维护祖国的主权和领土完整而战，为保卫远东和世界的和平而战！
    历史证明，中国人民最懂得“以牙还牙，以眼还眼”的道理，为了保卫祖国保卫世界和平，中国人民天不怕，地不怕，从来没有吝惜过自己的鲜血！侵略者还不要忘记这样一个事实：中国人民是从许多帝国主义强盗一百多年的压迫下解放出来的；中国人民在抗美援朝时期更同朝鲜人民在一起狠狠地教训过美国侵略者，现在我们比那时又更加强大了。可耻的凶恶的强盗啊，收起你的谎言，放下你的屠刀，留下你抢劫的财物，夹起了尾巴，从我们的院子里乖乖地滚出去吧！对你们来说，这是最聪明的，因为这样做，可以使你们在世界上多活几天。
