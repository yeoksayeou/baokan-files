Vanguard

Old man Zhou Houfu, who drives a horse-drawn cart, was just about to have dinner when an urgent task came up. So he and eight other cart drivers immediately got to work and drove their carts to the entrance of the brigade headquarters.

The county party secretary said, "This is a support-the-front task! It must be transported to the station overnight!" The accountant of the brigade headquarters said breathlessly that he had run back all the way after listening to the telephone conference convened by the People's Commune. All of the more than four thousand catties of scrap iron and scrap copper that had been recently purchased had to be transported away.

"What's going on?" Old Man Zhou asked, pretending to be confused. "Wasn't our county, our commune, going to smelt it ourselves? Why are we transporting it to the station overnight?"

"To support 'Tianjin Steel' and 'Tangshan Steel'!" the accountant said. "We won't leave even an ounce behind!"

"Then what about the copper?" Old Man Zhou asked again. "Wasn't the copper going to be used to exchange for electric wires to install electric lights in our brigade?"

According to the original plan, electric lights would soon be installed here. The county said: As long as each household can sell four catties of copper, they can have lights without oil! Everyone is eager for electric lights! As soon as the county mentioned this, not only scrap copper, but some people even took out copper utensils that they used every day. The cadres couldn't stop them!

"The copper is also being transported away!" the accountant said. "Grandpa, don't worry! If the copper is transported away, the electric lights might be brighter sooner!"

"What's there to worry about!" Old Man Zhou said unhappily. He felt that the accountant had underestimated his ideological level. "I'm just asking. In communist large-scale cooperation, who wouldn't trust whom!"

He picked up a copper ladle and threw it onto the cart. He recognized that it was the copper ladle he used to scoop water at home, and a few days ago, despite the cadres' dissuasion, he resolutely parted with it.

The cart was loaded, and it was completely dark.

It's hard to drive a cart in the dark. But for Zhou Houfu, this old hand, it wasn't a problem. He remembered that in the years of war, on autumn nights like this, he also drove a cart, transporting grain to support the front lines. Now, on this moonless autumn night, he was driving a cart again, supporting the front lines, and the cart was also loaded with "grain", not for the soldiers to eat, but for the "marshal" to eat!

On the highway, there were so many carts! Countless carts formed a transportation team, supporting the "steel marshal's" enthronement in a mighty and joyful manner! Old Man Zhou drove his cart into the flow of carts. The more carts, the longer the team, the higher people's spirits. Old Man Zhou walked along, thinking about the war years of artillery fire and the boundless communist prospects, from his old wife's beloved copper ladle to machines flying in the sky and running on the ground... He smiled, driving the livestock, and rushed forward...

The brightly lit place ahead was the railway station. This was a small town, now the location of the People's Commune's leadership, and according to the county's plan, it would be a small city in a few years. Zhou Houfu followed the traffic and drove his cart to a stop next to the railway. Zhou Houfu looked around: Hey, along the railway, the "grain" for the steel marshal was piled up like mountains, like cities! He dumped the hundreds of catties he had transported into it as well.

Someone exclaimed, "Truly a steel marshal! What a big appetite!"

"After the marshal ascends the throne, he will have to reward me, this vanguard!" Zhou Houfu said to himself softly.

    先行官
    冯健男
    赶大车的老汉周厚福正准备吃晚饭哩，突然来了紧急任务。于是他和其他的八个大车把式，立即动手，把车赶到大队部的门前。
    县委书记说：“这是支前任务！必须星夜运到车站！”大队部的会计气喘地说，他是在听完人民公社召开的电话会议之后，一路跑着赶回来的。要把最近收购的四千多斤废钢铁、废铜，全部运走。
    “这是怎么的啦？”周老汉一面装着，一面提出问题。“不是咱们县、咱们公社自己要炼么？怎么又要连夜往车站上运哪？”
    “支援‘津钢’、‘唐钢’！”会计说。“咱们一两也不留下！”
    “那么铜呢？”周老汉又问。“铜不是要用来换电线，给咱们大队安电灯么？”
    照原定计划，这里很快就要安电灯了。县里说：只要每户能出售四斤铜，就能点灯不用油！大家多渴望电灯呵！县里这么一提，不但是废铜，有人连日常使用着的铜器都拿出来了，干部们拦都拦不住！
    “铜也运走！”会计说。“大爷，您放心吧！铜运走了，电灯也许亮得更快呢！”
    “这有啥不放心的！”周老汉不快地说。他感到会计低估他的思想水平了。“我不过问问罢了。共产主义大协作，谁还不放心谁呀！”
    他拿起一把铜瓢，向车上甩去。他认得，这正是他自己家里用来舀水的那一把铜瓢，前两天，他不顾干部们的劝阻，坚决割爱了。
    车装好了，天完全黑下来了。
    黑夜里，车不好赶。不过凭周厚福这个老把式，这也就不算什么了。他想起在那战争的年月，也是这样的秋夜，他也是这样赶着车，运着粮食，支援前线。现在，在这个没有月亮的秋夜，他又在赶着车，支援前线，车上装的也是“粮食”，不是给战士吃的，而是给“元帅”吃的！
    公路上，好多的车呀！无数的大车组成的运输队，在浩浩荡荡、欢欢喜喜地支援钢铁元帅升帐！周老汉把自己的车，赶进车的流水中去了。车越多，队伍越长，人们的兴致越高。周老汉一路走，一路想，从炮火连天的战争年月想到幸福无边的共产主义前景，从老伴心爱的铜瓢想到满天飞、满地跑的机器……他笑着，赶着牲口，向前奔去……
    前方灯火通明之处，就是火车站了。这是一个小镇，现在是人民公社领导机构所在的地方，按照县里的规划，若干年后它将是一个小城市。周老汉随着车水马龙，把自己的车赶到铁路旁停下。周老汉放眼一看：嘿，沿着铁路，钢铁元帅的“粮食”堆得像山、像城！他把自己运来的几百斤也倒进去了。
    有人发出惊叹的声音：“真是钢铁元帅！好大的胃口！”
    “元帅升了帐，还得赏我这个先行官哩！”周老汉对自己轻轻地说。
