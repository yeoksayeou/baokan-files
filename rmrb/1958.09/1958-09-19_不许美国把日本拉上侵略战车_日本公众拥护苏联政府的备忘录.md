Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 18th (TASS dispatch) – Japanese democratic figures, newspapers, and radio commentators, in commenting on the recent memorandum submitted by the Soviet government to the Japanese government, stated that as long as American military bases exist on Japanese soil, the Japanese people will not feel at peace.

Recent Japanese press reports indicate that American troops based in Japan are being deployed to the Taiwan region, that American bases in Japan possess nuclear weapons, that American planes are "patrolling" over Japan with atomic bombs, and that American troops stationed in Japan are conducting "emergency evacuation drills" in the event of a war in the region. These reports have caused growing unease among the Japanese public. Due to these reports and the increasing anxiety about the nation's fate, the Japanese public views the Soviet government's memorandum as a timely warning in the interest of maintaining peace in the Far East.

Shigeru Tanegashi, Director of the International Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), told a TASS reporter that the Soviet Union, standing in support of the Chinese working people and genuinely concerned about maintaining peace in the Far East, naturally issued this warning. He said that Sohyo firmly believes that the cause of the current crisis in the Taiwan Strait lies in the United States' continued occupation of China's Taiwan and the Chiang Kai-shek clique's provocative incursions against China's coastal areas. To extinguish the flames of war, armed forces must be withdrawn from the Taiwan region as soon as possible. As for Japan, we demand that the government not become involved in this conflict and not allow the United States to drag Japan onto its path of aggression.

The "Mainichi Shimbun" stated that, according to the current "Security Treaty," the United States has the right to move its troops in and out of Japan. The newspaper concluded that as long as American military bases remain on Japanese soil, danger exists for Japan, and the Soviet government has pointed out this danger in the memorandum.

Yoshida, Deputy Secretary-General of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, told a TASS reporter that the Soviet government's memorandum is a reasonable and timely warning that cannot be ignored. Zenichi Oda, the Editorial Bureau Chief of the "Tokyo Times," shared the same view, emphasizing that the Soviet warning undoubtedly has significant meaning.

### 不许美国把日本拉上侵略战车  日本公众拥护苏联政府的备忘录

    不许美国把日本拉上侵略战车
    日本公众拥护苏联政府的备忘录
    新华社18日讯　塔斯社东京17日讯：日本各界民主人士、日本报纸和电台的评论员在评论苏联政府最近向日本政府提出的备忘录时说，只要日本的土地上存在着美国军事基地，日本人民就不会感到安宁。
    最近日本报刊报道，以日本为基地的美军开拔到台湾地区，美国在日本的基地有核武器，美国飞机载着原子弹在日本上空“巡逻”，驻日美军正在进行一旦在这个地区爆发战争情况下的“紧急撤退训练”，这些消息使日本公众感到越来越大的不安。由于这些消息和对于国家命运日益加强的不安，日本公众把苏联政府的备忘录看作是出于维护远东和平利益的及时警告。
    日本工会总评议会国际部部长种桥茂向塔斯社记者说，苏联站在支援中国劳动人民的立场上，并且切身地关怀维护远东和平，所以才提出这种警告，这是十分自然的。他说，日本工会总评议会表示坚决相信，造成目前台湾海峡地区的危机的原因在于美国继续占领中国的台湾和蒋介石集团对中国沿海地区的挑衅性进犯。为了扑灭战火，必须使武装部队尽快撤出台湾地区。至于日本，我们要求政府不要卷入这次冲突，并且不让美国把日本拉上它的侵略行动的轨道。
    “每日新闻”说，按照现在的“安全条约”，美国有权把它的军队向日本调进调出。报纸在这方面得出结论说，只要日本的土地上还有美国军事基地，对于日本就存在着危险，苏联政府在备忘录中已经指出了这种危险。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会副秘书长吉田向塔斯社记者说，苏联政府的备忘录是个合情合理的及时警告，不可忽视。“东京时报”的编辑局局长小田善一也有同样的看法，他强调说，苏联的警告无疑具有重要意义。
