Annihilating Enemy Aircraft over Nan'ao Island (Shandong Quick Talk)
　　Wan Zheng

　　Red flags flutter in the vast sky,
　　The People's Air Force shows its prowess high.
　　It happened on July twenty-ninth,
　　Victory was reported in the skies of Nan'ao Island so fine.
　　If you ask who fought this victorious fight,
　　It turns out it was Zhao De'an's squadron that seized the prime.
　　That day at eleven o'clock in the morning,
　　Thick clouds filled the heavens’ awning,
　　The wind sock blew with a whooshing sound,
　　Sometimes with thunder and raindrops on the ground.
　　(White) Who knew that just then, the command post called, saying: "There are four enemy planes, at an altitude of six hundred meters, direction southeast."
　　Suddenly, the signal to take off soared to the sky,
　　Zhao De'an's squadron rushed forward, running by,
　　In an instant, only the roar of the engines did sound,
　　Four planes flew into the sky profound.
　　Four heroes raised their heads and stared into the cloudy mass,
　　Eight eyes shining bright as glass,
　　It was a pity the visibility was poor that day,
　　The clouds made it hard to see the way,
　　Suddenly the command post's orders rang clear,
　　Saying four enemy planes were sneaking near.
　　(White) Zhao De'an thought: "Originally, after taking off, we should first penetrate the clouds and fly to several thousand meters to form a formation. Now the enemy is at a low altitude. Wouldn't we see them even less if we fly too high?"
　　The aerial commander Zhao De'an,
　　Saw the plane's altitude at two thousand span,
　　Quickly gave the order to turn left with might,
　　To form a combat formation below the cloud’s light.
　　This truly shows, Marxism-Leninism takes to the sky,
　　Daring to think, to speak, and to try,
　　They formed their squadron beneath the clouds,
　　To fight the Chiang planes, brave and proud.
　　At this time, Gao Changji and Zhang Yilin spotted the target fast,
　　In an instant, they found the enemy plane amassed,
　　While reporting to the command post,
　　They also reported to Zhao De'an, holding steadfast.
　　The command post immediately sent the order to all,
　　Ordering everyone to attack the enemy without a stall.
　　Here, let us pause our silver swallows,
　　And talk about the Chiang bandit pilots, fellows.
　　Among the Chiang planes, there was a Deputy Regiment Commander named Qiao,
　　With over ten years of flying experience, you know,
　　This fellow, led three planes in a low altitude roam,
　　Looking for a chance to drop bombs on the city, his home.
　　Who knew that the enemy's plot had already been seen through,
　　Delighting the aerial commander Zhao De'an, it's true.
　　He led everyone to dive and invert so fast,
　　With a whoosh, they circled behind the enemy at last.
　　Gao Changji was quick-eyed and quick-handed,
　　His cannon spoke first, as commanded,
　　Crying, "Flying thief, take your time to go,
　　I'll send you to the Western Heaven, low."
　　Boom, boom, boom, a burst of shells flew,
　　The enemy plane smoked black and askew.
　　This fellow was truly an "athlete" to boast,
　　Before dying, he still jumped into the sea, almost.
　　The other three, seeing the cannons on our planes make their say,
　　Panicked and wanted to return to Taiwan, astray.
　　Who knew Zhang Yilin's movements were fast and true,
　　Again, boom, boom, boom, a burst of tracer bullets flew,
　　Cutting off the enemy plane's left wing in sight,
　　Sending the enemy to the gate of hell in fright.
　　Huang Zhenhong protected the leader's plane well,
　　Giving the enemy plane a face-to-face duel.
　　This was truly a bear meeting a heroic man,
　　Making the enemy plane spin in a frantic plan.
　　That fellow, seeing the situation was bad, quickly pushed the stick with dread,
　　And ran right into Zhao De'an's lead.
　　Zhao De'an, pressed the button, and the shells shot forward,
　　Like a plane launching a rocket, adored.
　　This one, he hit and heavily wounded,
　　Running back to Taiwan, completely confounded.
　　This victory was fought well,
　　Good news spread throughout the nation, to tell,
　　The Ministry of National Defense issued a commendation,
　　Zhao De'an's squadron was awarded merits and promotions, in elation.
　　Here, let us end this part with cheer,
　　Hoping the front line will win more victories each year;
　　You win victories, and I will spread the word so clear.

### 南澳岛上歼敌机

　　南澳岛上歼敌机（山东快书）
    万正
    万里长空红旗飘，
    人民空军逞英豪。
    说的是七月二十九那一天，
    南澳岛上空捷报传。
    要问这个胜仗何人打，
    却原来是赵德安中队占了先。
    那天上午十一点，
    浓浓的乌云遮满天，
    风向袋吹得哗哗响，
    有时还打雷下雨点。
    （白）谁知正在这时，指挥所来了电话，说：“有敌机四架，高度六百公尺，方向东南。”
    忽然间，起飞的信号升上天，
    赵德安中队急忙跑步飞向前，
    一刹时，只听得马达轰隆隆响，
    四架飞机飞上天。
    四位英雄举目凝神云中望，
    八只眼睛亮闪闪，
    只可惜今天能见度坏，
    满天乌云看不见，
    忽听得指挥所命令传，
    说有四架敌机偷袭在云间。
    （白）赵德安心想：“本来起飞后先要穿云，要飞到几千公尺才能编队，现在敌人在低空，我们飞得太高不是更看不见了吗？”
    空中指挥员赵德安，
    眼看飞机高度有两千，
    忙下口令向左转，
    战斗队形要云下编。
    这真是，马列主义上了天，
    敢想，敢说又敢干，
    他们云下编好队，
    迎击蒋机去作战。
    在这时，高长吉张以林发现目标快，
　　一下子，就把敌机来发现，
　　一面报告指挥所，
　　一面报告赵德安。
　　指挥所立刻把命令传，
　　叫大家攻击敌机莫怠慢。
　　说到这里按下咱银燕暂不表，
　　咱说一说蒋贼飞行员。
　　蒋机中，有个姓乔的副团长，
　　飞行历史有十几年，
　　这小子，带了三架飞机在低空转，
　　瞅个空，想到城市里面扔炸弹。
　　谁知道，敌人阴谋早已被我来看穿，
　　乐坏了空中指挥员赵德安。
　　他带着大家下滑倒转来的快，
　　唰的一下绕到敌机身后边。
　　高长吉眼明手又快，
　　他的大炮先发言，
　　叫声飞贼慢慢走，
　　老子送你上西天。
　　咚咚咚一阵炮弹射出去，
　　敌机轰的一声冒黑烟。
　　这小子真是一个“运动员”，
　　临死前，还要跳到海里边。
　　另三架，看到我们飞机上的大炮发了言，
　　慌慌张张想回台湾。
　　谁知张以林的动作来得快，
　　又是咚咚咚的一阵曳光弹，
　　打得敌机左翼全切去，
　　打得敌人送进鬼门关。
　　黄振洪掩护长机好，
　　给敌机打了一个面对面。
　　这真是狗熊碰到了英雄汉，
　　急得敌机团团转。
　　那小子，一看不好忙推杆，
　　正好碰到赵德安。
　　赵德安，一按电纽炮弹齐向前，
　　好像飞机发火箭。
　　这一架，被他打得负重伤，
　　屁滚尿流回台湾。
　　这一个胜仗打得好，
　　全国各地捷报传，
　　国防部通令来嘉奖，
　　赵德安中队每人立功晋了衔。
　　说到这里算一段，
　　希望前线多多打胜仗；
　　你打胜仗我宣传。
