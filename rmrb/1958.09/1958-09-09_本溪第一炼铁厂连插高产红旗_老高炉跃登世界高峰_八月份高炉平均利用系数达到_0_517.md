Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant Continues to Plant High-Yield Red Flags
Old Blast Furnace Leaps to World Peak
Blast Furnace Average Utilization Rate Reaches 0.517 in August
    (Our newspaper's report) The Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, which has won the national blast furnace "collective championship" for four consecutive months, created a new national record in August with a utilization coefficient of 0.517 for two blast furnaces; the monthly output of pig iron increased by 41% compared with August last year. As of September 8, the No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces produced 1,432 tons of pig iron per day. The workers expressed that they will create high-yield days and high-yield months in September to counter the military provocations and war threats of U.S. imperialism. These two blast furnaces still lead the way in the national high-yield records of large and medium-sized iron-smelting blast furnaces.
    The pig iron output of these two blast furnaces has been rising in a straight line since April this year. In April, the average utilization coefficient improved to 0.645, creating the highest record for monthly pig iron production and winning the title of "collective champion" of national large and medium-sized blast furnaces. Since then, the average utilization coefficient of the blast furnaces has continued to improve; in five months, the pig iron output of the two blast furnaces increased by 36.6% compared with the same period last year.
    The Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant's continuous establishment of the "high-yield red flag" for blast furnaces for five consecutive months was achieved after a sharp struggle by all the plant's employees against the conservative thinking of "condition-ism" during the rectification movement. These two blast furnaces, which have established the high-yield red flag for pig iron, have been in use for more than 40 years. In recent years, thanks to the meticulous maintenance and repair by the employees and their efforts to improve operating techniques, the pig iron output of the blast furnaces has increased rapidly. However, some management cadres and technicians in the plant believed that production had already improved rapidly under the conditions of such outdated blast furnace equipment, and that the task for the future was to "stabilize" the production level that had been achieved. Therefore, from 1954 to 1957, the technical level of these two blast furnaces did not improve much.
    In the double-anti movement at the beginning of this year, employees posted many big-character posters, fiercely attacking the conservative thinking of "condition-ism." The employees meticulously maintained the blast furnace equipment to prevent accidents in all aspects; at the same time, they took measures to load more raw materials into the blast furnaces, increase the temperature of fuel combustion in the furnaces, and shorten the smelting time of raw materials in the furnaces. Several experiments not only did not cause any major accidents, but also created new records for the utilization coefficient many times in a row, and the output of pig iron rose in a straight line. All the employees of the plant were full of confidence and even more motivated. The iron-smelting workers operating under high temperatures guarded their posts day and night with concentration to ensure the normal tapping of iron from the blast furnaces; the workers responsible for loading and transporting blast furnace raw materials, in order to let the blast furnaces eat a rich "meal", would rather have the materials waiting for the furnace than the furnace waiting for the materials. Whether it was the technical personnel in the offices or the workers in the auxiliary sections of the blast furnaces, they were doing everything possible to create favorable conditions for the normal production of the blast furnaces.
    "Condition-ism" has finally gone bankrupt. Now, the two ancient blast furnaces have regained their youth and are entering the forefront of advanced iron-smelting technology at home and abroad with steady steps.
    On the basis of the excellent results achieved in August, the employees of this iron and steel plant revised the leap forward plan for the ninth time. Recently, after hearing Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area, the workers were determined to support Premier Zhou's statement with practical actions of producing more steel and iron and to fight back against the military provocations of the American invaders. Wei Tianming, the furnace chief of the Youth Furnace, said: We stand on the industrial iron and steel front, we must work hard to complete the production tasks to support the motherland in liberating Taiwan, and we are always ready to meet the provocations of U.S. imperialism. Wang Zhonghui, director of the Second Coking Workshop, said that it is necessary to reduce the coke ash to below 11% and increase coke production to ensure the raw material needs of pig iron production. Now all the employees of the plant are full of confidence and constantly creating new records. We must plant the high-yield red flag that has already been won on a higher peak.

　　本溪第一炼铁厂连插高产红旗
　　老高炉跃登世界高峰
    八月份高炉平均利用系数达到0.517
    本报讯　连续四个月获得全国高炉“集体冠军”的本溪第一炼铁厂，8月份又创造了两座高炉利用系数0.517的全国新纪录；生铁的月产量比去年8月增长了41％。到9月8日，一号和二号高炉日产生铁一千四百三十二吨。工人们表示要在9月份创造高产日、高产月来回击美帝国主义的军事挑衅和战争威胁。在全国大中型炼铁高炉的丰产纪录中，这两座高炉仍然遥遥领先。
    这两座高炉的生铁产量，今年4月份以来直线上升。4月份，平均利用系数改善到0.645，创造出月产生铁的最高纪录，获得了全国大中型高炉“集体冠军”的称号。以后，高炉的平均利用系数继续改善；在五个月中，两座高炉的生铁产量比去年同期增长了36.6％。
    本溪第一炼铁厂连续五个月树立高炉的“高产红旗”，是在整风运动中，全厂职工向“条件论”者的保守思想进行了一番尖锐的斗争之后才取得的。这两座树立生铁高产红旗的高炉，已经使用了四十多年。几年来，由于职工们精心地检修维护，设法改进操作技术，使高炉的生铁产量迅速提高。可是，厂里的一些管理干部和技术人员却认为在高炉设备如此陈旧的条件下，生产已经提高得很快了，今后的任务就是把已达到的生产水平“稳定”下来。因此，从1954年到1957年的四年中，这两座高炉的生产技术水平一直没有多大提高。
    在今年年初双反运动中，职工们贴出许多张大字报，猛烧“条件论”者的这种保守思想。职工们一面精心地维护高炉设备，不使各个环节发生事故；一面采取措施往高炉内装入更多的原料，加大燃料在炉内燃烧的温度，缩短原料在炉内的冶炼时间。几次试验，不仅没有发生任何重大事故，而且连接多次地创造了利用系数的新纪录，生铁的产量直线上升。全厂职工信心百倍，干劲更大了。在高温下操作的炼铁工人，昼夜聚精会神地坚守岗位，保证高炉正常出铁；担任装运高炉原料的工人，为了让高炉吃到丰盛的“美餐”，宁肯叫料等炉，不叫炉等料。不论是科室的技术人员，或是高炉各辅助工段的工人，都在千方百计地给高炉正常生产创造有利条件。
    “条件论”者终于破产了。现在，两座古老的高炉已经恢复了它的青春，并且以稳健的步伐走进国内外先进炼铁技术的前列。
    这个炼铁厂在8月份取得优异成绩的基础上，职工们第九次修改了跃进计划。最近，工人们在听到周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，决心以多产钢铁的实际行动拥护周总理声明，回击美国侵略者的军事挑衅。青年炉炉长韦天明说：我们站在工业钢铁战线上，要努力完成生产任务，来支援祖国解放台湾，我们时刻准备着来迎击美帝国主义的挑衅。第二炼焦车间主任王中惠表示要做到使焦灰降低到11％以下，增加焦产量来保证生铁生产原料的需要。现在全厂职工都信心百倍，不断创造新纪录。要把已经夺得的高产红旗插上更高峰。
