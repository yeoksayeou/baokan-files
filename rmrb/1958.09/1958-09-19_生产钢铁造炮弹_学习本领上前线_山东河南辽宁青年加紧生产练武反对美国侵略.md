Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th: More than ten million young people in Shandong Province are striving to produce steel and grain while intensifying martial arts training to fight back against the military provocations of American aggressors.

In the LinYi region, 250,000 young people are vigorously engaged in the iron smelting movement. As of the 11th, in addition to building more than 4,700 furnaces with adults, they also built 910 youth furnaces. In Tancheng County, where there is no local ore, more than 3,000 young people participated in expeditions to Cangshan County to engage in iron smelting. Young people in coastal areas such as Rizhao, Rongcheng, Haiyang, Muping, and Changdao, together with local adults, have formed combat units and are actively carrying out martial arts training, vigilantly guarding the motherland's gate in coordination with the garrison troops. In Rizhao County, 74,200 young people have formed steel corps and water conservancy corps, combining production and training closely. The 5,700 young people of Xiangzishan People's Commune in this county are actively practicing aiming, shooting, and grenade throwing during the morning, noon, and work breaks. The young people of the Red Star People's Commune in LinYi County get up before dawn every day to drill, and they bring their guns and targets to the construction site, practicing shooting actions during breaks. Now they have mastered the essentials of shooting and learned how to use the terrain.

In cities, young people are also actively practicing martial arts. In Jinan, 130,000 young people from factories, institutions, schools, and streets have all been armed and are currently learning various military subjects. Their slogan is: "Produce steel at work, train after work, produce steel to make shells, learn skills to go to the front lines, and defeat the American imperialist big bad guys!"

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 18th: The military provocations of American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait region have angered 8.5 million young people in Henan Province. Two and a half million young people in the province's steel army are mining and smelting day and night in the Taihang Mountains, Dabie Mountains, and Funiu Mountains. Their battle cry is: "Smelt more iron and more steel, and severely attack the American wolves." They have also established more than 3,400 youth steel plants and steel furnaces, and more than 32,000 youth iron furnaces. The youth in the Qianjing Iron and Steel battle zone built nearly 6,000 indigenous blast furnaces in two days, the 8th and 9th, increasing the daily iron production to more than 1,400 tons.

Encouraged by the slogan "Deeply plow the land to produce more grain, and have the strength to liberate Taiwan," more than 2.2 million young people on the agricultural front are enthusiastically launching a plowing movement. In Shangqiu and Xiayi counties, more than 130,000 young people organized more than 1,600 plowing shock teams and plowed more than 268,000 mu of land in less than ten days. In Xuchang area, more than 26,000 mu out of 32,000 mu of dry land were plowed to a depth of three to seven chi. They say that plowing one more point of land is like eliminating one American wolf.

While carrying out the production movement, young people throughout the province are actively conducting military training and shooting practice, ready to strike at any enemy who dares to invade. Among the more than 18,000 basic militia in 28 counties and cities in Xinxiang Prefecture who participated in the first live ammunition shooting, more than 14,000 achieved excellent and good results, accounting for more than 75% of the total number of participants. In addition, the basic militia of Wuji Township in Deng County and Liguanqiao Township in Xichuan County all passed the first shooting practice. They unanimously stated that once the motherland needs them, they will immediately go to the front lines.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th: The four million young people of Liaoning Province stand at the forefront of the struggle against American imperialist aggression. Under the slogan "Always be ready," young people in factories, rural areas, schools, institutions, and streets have armed themselves at a rapid pace. Young people in units such as Dalian Shipyard, Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 4, and Shenyang Crane Factory have established militia organizations. Many schools have been militarized. Liaoning University, Shenyang Agricultural College, and Shenyang Medical College have all established militia divisions. The vast number of young people are stepping up their training day and night, learning military skills. At dawn, dusk, and during labor breaks, the sound of drills can be heard everywhere from cities to rural areas. Since August, the rural youth basic militia in Liaoning Province have generally received one military training session and have achieved excellent results. The training results of the militia in Shicheng Island Township, Zhuanghe County, have reached a passing rate of over 95%. The shooting performance of young women is even more outstanding, with a passing rate as high as 98% or more. In Changhai County, female militia members, like young men, disregarded the heat and endured wind and rain during training. Even when their arms were chafed raw, they persisted in their training. In just five days, they achieved excellent overall shooting results, with nine girls hitting the bullseye three times out of three shots in live ammunition shooting.

Young people now hold tools in one hand and guns in the other; they are students when they pick up books, and soldiers when they pick up guns. Every young person has made a vow to the motherland: once the motherland calls, they will immediately rush to the front lines and eliminate the enemy wherever they come from.
