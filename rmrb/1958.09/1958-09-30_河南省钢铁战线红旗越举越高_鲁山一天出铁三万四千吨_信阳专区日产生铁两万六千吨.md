Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 29th: Lushan County, Henan Province, which pioneered the national daily output of 1,000 tons of iron, launched another "satellite" on the 28th, with a daily output of 34,360 tons of pig iron.

　　On that day, 10,146 various iron-smelting furnaces were put into production throughout the county. In order to ensure that all the built iron-smelting furnaces in the county were flowing with molten iron, the Lushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized hundreds of thousands of steelworkers to mine ore in the mountains, pan for iron sand in the rivers, and mobilize the masses to open many small coal mines. Various places also gathered more than 1,100 carpenters to rush-produce 7,100 wooden bellows for the newly built iron-smelting furnaces. A wave of learning technology was also set off throughout the county. Within five days, methods such as inviting experts in, sending people out, and on-site guidance were used to train 12,000 technical workers, quickly overcoming the technical barriers.

　　When the Lushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized the launch of this iron-smelting satellite throughout the county, 15 county committee members participated in the leadership and implemented the "five guarantees" and "eight fixings" responsibility system. The so-called "five guarantees" are: the county committee guarantees the steel command area, the district and township party committees guarantee the factory, the factory party committee guarantees the workshop, the workshop负责人 guarantees the shock brigade, and party members and Youth League members guarantee people; the "eight fixings" are: fixing leadership, fixing tasks, fixing time, fixing personnel, fixing tools, fixing quality, fixing conservation, and fixing safety.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 29th: Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, created a high-yield record of 26,707.32 tons of pig iron per day on the 28th, and two counties emerged with a daily output of more than 10,000 tons of pig iron. Among them, Xinyang County produced 13,631.53 tons of pig iron, and Shangcheng County produced 12,567.5 tons of pig iron.

　　The party organizations at all levels under the Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party went all out in this battle. Not only did the first secretaries of the party committees of key iron-smelting counties such as Xinyang and Shangcheng personally direct steel production, but also the first secretaries of the county committees of the plain areas such as Runan, Shangcai, Xin County, and Pingyu led their teams to counties with iron ore resources to cooperate with these counties in large-scale iron smelting. In order to ensure that the iron-smelting satellite was launched on time, the party committees at all levels also newly organized many shock brigades and professional teams to participate in furnace construction, mining, panning for iron sand, and preparing fuel, and added transport vehicles to transport "grain and grass" to the steel marshals. On the 28th, a total of 27,889 various iron-smelting furnaces were put into production throughout the prefecture, and a steel army of 1.1 million people fought beside the furnaces, in the mines, and on the transport lines.

    河南省钢铁战线红旗越举越高
    鲁山一天出铁三万四千吨
    信阳专区日产生铁两万六千吨
    据新华社郑州29日电  首创全国日产千吨铁的河南省鲁山县，在28日又放出一颗日产生铁三万四千三百六十吨的大卫星。
    这天全县有一万零一百四十六座各种炼铁炉投入生产。中共鲁山县委为保证全县已建成的炼铁炉个个铁水奔流，曾经组织十几万钢铁大军上山采矿石，到河中淘铁砂，并且发动群众开了很多小煤窑。各地还集中了一千一百多个木匠，给新建的炼铁炉赶制了七千一百多个木制风箱。全县还掀起了学习技术的热潮，在五天内采用请进来、派出去和现场辅导等办法，培养了一万二千名技术工人，迅速地闯过了技术关。
    中共鲁山县委在组织全县发射这颗炼铁大卫星的时候，有十五个县委委员参加了领导，并且实行了“五包”“八定”责任制。所谓“五包”，就是县委包钢铁指挥区，区乡党委包厂，厂党委包车间，车间负责人包突击组，党团员包人；“八定”是：定领导、定任务、定时间、定人员、定工具、定质量、定节约和定安全。
    新华社郑州29日电  河南省信阳专区在28日创造了日产生铁二万六千七百零七点三二吨的高产纪录，并且出现了两个日产生铁万吨以上的县。其中信阳县产生铁一万三千六百三十一点五三吨，商城县产生铁一万二千五百六十七点五吨。
    中共信阳地委所属各级党组织在这次战斗中都是全力以赴。不仅像信阳、商城这样的炼铁重点县的党委第一书记都亲自指挥钢铁生产，就是平原地区的汝南、上蔡、新县、平舆等县的县委第一书记，也都带着人马到有铁矿资源的县，同这些县协作大搞炼铁。各级党委为了保证炼铁大卫星按时上天，还新组织了很多突击队和专业队参加建炉、采矿、淘铁砂和准备燃料，并增添了运输车辆给钢铁元帅运送“粮草”。在28日这天，全专区投入生产的各种炼铁炉共达二万七千八百八十九座，战斗在炉旁、矿山和运输线上的钢铁大军有一百一十万人。
