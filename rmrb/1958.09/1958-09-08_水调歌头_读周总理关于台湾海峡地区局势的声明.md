    Shui Diao Ge Tou
    Reading Premier Zhou's Statement on the Situation in the Taiwan Strait Area
    Ye Shengtao
　　The will of six hundred million people is righteous and the words are stern. Taiwan, Jinmen, and other islands are entirely within our sovereignty. The United States is intent on aggression, using the pretext of supporting the Kuomintang remnants, stirring up turbulent waves in the East China Sea. We are unafraid, our shared hatred of the enemy is as firm as gold. Displaying brute force, wantonly threatening, speaking with madness. The world's public opinion can attest, to whom does approval belong? Do you remember the events of Korea? The tiger was originally made of paper, do you wish to engage once more? Confused and uncomprehending, you will surely lose your essence.

    水调歌头
    读周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明
    叶圣陶
　　六亿人民志，义正复辞严。台湾金马诸岛，我自有全权。美国存心侵略，借口支持残匪，东海起狂澜。在我固无惧，敌忾比金坚。逞蛮力，肆威胁，语风颠。举世舆论堪证，赞许属谁边。记否朝鲜往事？老虎原来是纸，宁欲再周旋？迷惑不知悟，将必丧其元。
