　　The good news that Shaanxi Province has become a "Hundred Jin Ginned Cotton Province" has arrived just as we are festively celebrating National Day. This is another great victory on our agricultural front. The bumper grain harvest has greatly improved our grain situation, solving and greatly improving the problem of food for 600 million people. Now, the great leap forward in cotton – the birth of the "Hundred Jin Ginned Cotton Province" – provides a huge possibility for finally solving the problem of clothing for 600 million people. Solving the problems of people's food and clothing solves the most important and fundamental problems in people's lives. For thousands of years, the Chinese people have longed for the day when they could live a life of plenty, but they have not been able to achieve it. Only today, after establishing their own country under the leadership of the Communist Party, have the hopes of hundreds of millions of people begun to be realized. This is the victory of Marxism, the victory of the socialist system, and the victory of the people.
　　The birth of the "Hundred Jin Ginned Cotton Province" vividly proves that under the illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the people who break superstitions, liberate their minds, and establish a noble communist style can not only make grain production leap forward at a speed that has never appeared in the world, but also make cotton and other crops grow rapidly at the same speed. According to the estimates of the agricultural department, the unit area yield of cotton in our country this year will increase by more than double last year, reaching 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu; the total output of cotton will also increase by more than double last year, reaching 70 million dan. Whether in terms of growth rate, unit area yield, or total output, our country has surpassed all capitalist countries in the world. Is this not another vivid proof that the socialist system has unparalleled superiority over the capitalist system! The United States is known as the "Wheat Kingdom" and also has the most cotton in the world. Because it has these two things, it runs rampant and swindles in economically backward countries. However, in the face of China's bumper harvest this year, what does this count for! People already know that the total wheat output in our country this year has reached 80 billion jin, while the United States only has 77.3 billion jin, we have exceeded this "World Wheat Kingdom" by 2.7 billion jin. Now, China's cotton has greatly surpassed the United States. According to the US Department of Agriculture, the US cotton production in 1958 is expected to reach 52.53 million dan, which is nearly 20 million dan less than the total cotton output in our country this year.
　　In this year's great leap forward in agriculture, all parts of the country have created very rich experiences in grain production and have begun to enter the stage of "making crops grow according to human will." After three years of hard work, or in a shorter period, the needs of the people of the whole country for grain can be fully met, reaching a level of 2,000 jin of grain per capita. After the grain problem has been basically solved, solving the problem of cash crops, especially cotton, has become a very important task on our agricultural front. The Party and the state have decided to expand the planting area of cotton next year, so that the total output of cotton will increase by about 50% again. Now, the emergence of the "Hundred Jin Ginned Cotton Province" will undoubtedly further strengthen the confidence of the vast number of farmers in cotton-growing areas in striving for a greater leap forward in cotton production next year. We hope that the comrades in Shaanxi Province will continue to strengthen the late-stage management of cotton fields and do a good job in harvesting, while at the same time earnestly and deeply summarizing the experience of increasing cotton production, which is of great significance to the country's efforts to achieve a greater leap forward in cotton production next year.

### 棉花丰产的先声

    棉花丰产的先声
    正当我们张灯结彩欢欣鼓舞地迎接国庆的时候，传来了陕西省成为“百斤皮棉省”的喜报。这是我国农业战线上又一个伟大的胜利。粮食大丰收，使我国的粮食状况有了极大的改善，解决并极大地改善了六亿人民的吃饭问题。现在棉花大跃进——“百斤皮棉省”的诞生，又为最后解决六亿人民的穿衣问题提供了巨大的可能。解决了人们吃饭、穿衣问题，就解决了人民生活中最主要最根本的问题。几千年来我国人民就渴望着有一天能够过上丰衣足食生活，但是都没有能够实现。只是在今天，在共产党领导下建立了自己的国家以后，亿万人民的希望才开始实现了。这是马克思主义的胜利，社会主义制度的胜利，人民的胜利。
    “百斤皮棉省”的诞生，生动地证明，在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，破除迷信、解放思想、树立高尚的共产主义风格的人民，不仅能使粮食产量以世界上从来没有出现过的速度向前跃进，也能使棉花和其他作物的产量以同样的速度向上猛长。据农业部门预计，我国今年的棉花单位面积产量将比去年提高一倍以上，达到亩产皮棉八十斤；棉花的总产量也将比去年增加一倍以上，达到七千万担。无论在增长速度方面，还是在单位面积产量和总产量方面，我国都超过了世界上一切资本主义国家。难道这不是又一次生动地证明社会主义制度比资本主义制度有无比的优越性吗！美国号称是“小麦王国”，也是世界上拥有棉花最多的国家。就是因为它有了这两样东西，就在经济落后的国家里横冲直闯，招摇撞骗。但是，在今年我国丰收面前，这又算得什么呢！人们已经知道，我国今年的小麦总产量已达八百亿斤，而美国只有七百七十三亿斤，我们超过了这个“世界小麦王国”二十七亿斤。现在，我国的棉花又大大的超过了美国，据美国农业部宣布，1958年美国棉花产量预计将达五千二百五十三万担，这个数字同我国今年棉花的总产量比较起来，相差将近二千万担。
    今年农业大跃进，在粮食生产上全国各地都创造了十分丰富的经验，已经开始进入“要庄稼按照人的意志生长”的阶段。苦战三年，或者在更短的时间，就能够充分满足全国人民对粮食的需要，达到每人平均占有粮食二千斤的水平。在粮食问题已经基本解决以后，解决经济作物首先是棉花问题，就成为我国农业战线上一个很重要的任务了。党和国家已经决定明年扩大棉花的种植面积，使棉花总产量再提高50％左右。现在，“百斤皮棉省”的出现，无疑将更加坚定棉区广大农民争取明年棉花更大跃进的信心。我们希望陕西省的同志们在继续加强棉田后期管理，作好收摘工作的同时，认真深入地总结棉花增产的经验，这对全国争取明年棉花生产的更大跃进有着重大的意义。
