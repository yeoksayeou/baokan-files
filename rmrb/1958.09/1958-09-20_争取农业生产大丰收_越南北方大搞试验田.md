(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) Xinhua News Agency dispatch: As the upsurge of planting experimental fields in northern Vietnam is rising higher and higher in provinces such as Ha Dong, Nam Dinh, and Thai Binh, reporters visited the Ha Dong Province Agricultural Science and Technology Research Farm near Hanoi.

    The director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, Phạm Văn Phan, the head of the farm, Trình Hữu Quang, female researcher Lê Hằng Minh, and others are busy in the experimental field planted according to the experience of the high yield of 3,000,000 kg per hectare of mid-season rice in the Tianbei Cooperative in the Yuebei mountainous area of ​​China. Phạm Văn Phan said that just two days ago, Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng had come to inspect this experimental field.

    The leaders of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Vietnamese government attach great importance to the work of planting experimental fields. In June, Deputy Prime Minister Trường Chinh instructed cadres to try planting experimental fields when he inspected the countryside. Later, Deputy Prime Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp also inspected this work when he went to the countryside. As China's early rice and mid-season rice high-yield "satellites" appeared one after another, the enthusiasm of Vietnamese cadres and rural youths for engaging in experimental fields became even higher. Up to now, Ha Dong Province alone has had more than 4,000 experimental fields, each about half a Chinese mu in size. This work was first started by cadres at the provincial and county levels. In some counties, the county party secretary personally took the lead in planting experimental fields. Soon, every county in Ha Dong Province had experimental fields, with Huaide County alone having more than 1,000 experimental fields. Most of these experimental fields were set up by young farmers learning from the example of cadres. The Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Youth League strengthened the encouragement, organization, and leadership of young farmers in engaging in experimental fields; rural women's organizations also strongly supported planting experimental fields.

    Phạm Văn Phan told reporters that the experimental fields in Ha Dong Province were set up by cadres and farmers with an impatient mood, according to the experience materials of China's experimental field planting reported by Xinhua News Agency. He said that we urgently hope that Tianbei Cooperative, Jianguo Cooperative, and other high-yield cooperatives in China will systematically introduce the "satellite" experience to us, so that our next batch of experimental fields can be done even better.

    A recent cadre meeting in Ha Dong Province, the Red River Delta in northern Vietnam, which is rich in rice production, decided that from next year, all cadres in the province related to agricultural production will participate in planting experimental fields.

    A news report in the "Nhân Dân" (People) newspaper said that 62 county-level cadres, 671 commune-level cadres, and more than 3,500 youths in Ha Dong Province have participated in the work of planting experimental fields this autumn. In addition, 1,365 mutual aid teams have also planted experimental fields.

    In the movement to promote experimental fields, the Vietnamese "Nhân Dân" (People) newspaper also published pictures and articles introducing China's high-yield agricultural "satellite" fields. In an editor's note reprinting an article about Jianguo Cooperative from the Beijing "People's Daily," the "Nhân Dân" (People) newspaper said that the high yields obtained by Chinese farmers are unprecedented and have never been imagined. The great achievements made by Chinese farmers have made the Vietnamese people very excited and increased their confidence.

### 争取农业生产大丰收  越南北方大搞试验田

    争取农业生产大丰收
    越南北方大搞试验田
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：当越南北方种试验田的热潮正在河东、南定、太平等省越来越高涨的时候，记者访问了河内市附近的河东省农业科学技术研究场。
    省农业司司长范文潘同场长程友光、女研究员黎恒明等正在根据中国粤北山区田北社中稻亩产六万斤高产量的经验进行种植的试验田里忙着。范文潘说，刚在两天以前，范文同总理曾经来视察过这块试验田。
    越南劳动党和越南政府领导人对种试验田的工作很重视。6月间，长征副总理在到农村视察时就曾经指示干部们试种试验田。后来，武元甲副总理下乡时也视察过这项工作。随着中国早稻、中稻高产“卫星”一个接着一个的出现，越南干部和农村青年搞试验田的热情也更加高涨。截至目前为止，仅河东省就出现了四千多块试验田，每块约合中国亩半亩左右。这个工作首先是由省、县级干部搞起来的。有的县里，县委书记亲自带头种试验田。很快地，河东省县县都有了试验田，其中怀德县一县就有一千多块试验田。这许多试验田大部分是青年农民学着干部的榜样搞起来的。越南劳动青年团中央加强了对青年农民搞试验田的鼓励、组织和领导工作；农村妇女团体也大力支持种试验田。
    范文潘对记者说，河东省的试验田是干部和农民在急不可待的心情下，根据新华社报道的中国种试验田的经验材料搞起来的。他说，我们迫切希望田北社、建国社和中国其它高产社向我们系统介绍“卫星”经验，使得我们下一批的试验田能够搞得更出色。
    越南北方红河三角洲盛产稻米的河东省最近举行的一次干部会议决定，从明年开始，全省所有同农业生产有关的干部都要参加种试验田。
    “人民报”报道的消息说，河东省全省已有六十二名县级干部、六百七十一名乡级干部和三千五百多个青年在今秋参加了种试验田的工作。此外还有一千三百六十五个变工组也种了试验田。
    在推广试验田的运动中，越南“人民报”还刊登了介绍中国农业高产的“卫星”田的图片和文章。“人民报”在转载北京“人民日报”的一篇关于建国社的文章的按语中说，中国农民所得到的高额产量是空前的，也是从来没有人想到的。中国农民获得这样伟大的成绩，使越南人民非常兴奋，并且增加了他们的信心。
