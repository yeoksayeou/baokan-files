Denouncing Eisenhower
Guo Moruo

Eisenhower, I truly feel ashamed for you. Your hypocrisy has permeated to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean! You and Dulles are truly brothers in arms. Your television speech is not only deceiving people, but also deceiving yourself, Ike. You say we have some "territorial ambition," "invading" Jinmen and Matsu, our islands; your robber logic is truly laughable! However, this is not uncommon for you; you have been talking such nonsense for years. You said that the Koreans "invaded" Korea; you said that the Vietnamese "invaded" Vietnam; you said that the Lebanese "invaded" Lebanon; you said that the Jordanians "invaded" Jordan. Who would believe that your brains are truly sound? You proclaim yourselves as the caretakers of the whole world, the whole world must be occupied by you, America; and you even want to occupy outer space, turning the moon into a white dot on the Stars and Stripes. Unfortunately, your rockets only cause trouble. "The thief cries, 'Stop thief!'" you think you are clever; indeed, you have provided a typical example. Do you really think that all of humanity are fools? You also talk about "opposing aggression and safeguarding peace," not a madman, even you yourself would not believe it. Eisenhower, I truly feel ashamed for you! Don't embarrass the American people any further. I advise you to have your brain treated as soon as possible. The American people also love peace, I believe, they will not support a liar like you! I advise the American people to also prepare early, send some lunatics to the insane asylum; give them "electroshock" therapy, don't let them cause chaos again. Of course, these people should include Dulles. This is the common wish of the people of the world, otherwise it will become "Fire burns Kun Gang." (Note) The people of the world have the power to stop disasters. In order to ensure the happiness of mankind, we must never allow the warmongers to be mad again!

(Note) The ancient saying "Fire burns Kun Gang, jade and stone are burned together" means that good and bad will suffer alike.

    斥艾森豪威尔
    郭沫若艾森豪威尔，我真替你羞耻，你的伪善彻透了太平洋的海底！你同杜勒斯不愧是难兄难弟，你的电视演说不仅在欺骗人，简直在欺骗你艾克自己。你说，我们有什么“领土野心”，在“侵略”金门马祖，我们的岛屿；你的强盗逻辑真足令人笑死！不过，这在你们倒也不算稀奇，几年来你们一直都在这样放屁。你们说过，朝鲜人“侵略”朝鲜；你们说过，越南人“侵略”越南；你们说过，黎巴嫩人“侵略”黎巴嫩；你们说过，约旦人“侵略”约旦。谁会相信，你们的大脑真是健全？你们自封为全世界的总管，全世界都得由你美国霸占；还要一直霸占到外层空间，把月球也变成花旗上的一个白点。可惜，你们的火箭却只会捣蛋。“贼喊捉贼”，你自以为高明；不错，你是提供了一个典型。你真以为全人类都是傻瓜吗？你也在谈“反对侵略，保卫和平”，不是狂人，连你自己也不会相信。艾森豪威尔，我真替你羞耻！你不要再替美国人民丢脸吧，奉劝你把你的大脑早早医治。美国人民是同样爱好和平的，我相信，不会拥戴你这样的骗子！我奉劝美国人民也早作准备，把一些狂人们都送进疯人院里；替他们施行“电气休克”的治疗，不要让他们再闹得乌烟瘴气。当然，这些人中要包括杜勒斯。这是世界人民的共同愿望，要不然就会弄成“火炎昆岗”。（注）世界人民有制止灾难的力量，为了使人类幸福能得到保证，总要使战争狂人们不准再狂！
    （注）古语“火炎昆岗，玉、石俱焚”，是不分好坏都会遭殃的意思。
