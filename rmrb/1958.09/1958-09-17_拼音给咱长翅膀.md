    Pinyin helps us consolidate literacy, if you forget a Chinese character, look at the alphabet; Pinyin helps us improve literacy, no matter how many new characters there are, we won’t be defeated.

    Everyone is sweeping away illiteracy, production and learning are well-arranged; to consolidate literacy, the people's schools also teach Pinyin.

    Everyone is finding ways to eliminate illiteracy, whatever is convenient is good; if you ask how to consolidate literacy, the Pinyin alphabet is the magic weapon.

    Books are annotated with sounds, teachers use the alphabet as guidance; we can learn anytime, everywhere is a classroom.

    Socialism is paradise, you can't get there without culture; to learn literacy and culture, Pinyin gives us wings.

    The Pinyin alphabet is good, it helps us remember characters firmly; the Pinyin alphabet is wonderful, we can learn characters ourselves and teach others.

    拼音给咱长翅膀
    （山东民歌）
    一拼音识字能巩固，忘了汉字看字母；拼音识字能提高，生字再多难不倒。
    二大家都把文盲扫，生产学习安排好；为了识字能巩固，民校还把拼音教。
    三扫盲办法大家找，怎么方便怎么好；若问怎么能巩固，拼音字母是法宝。
    四书本注上音，老师字母当；随时能学习，到处是课堂。
    五社会主义是天堂，没有文化不能上；为了识字学文化，拼音给咱长翅膀。
    六拼音字母好，识字能记牢；拼音字母妙，自己识字自己教。
