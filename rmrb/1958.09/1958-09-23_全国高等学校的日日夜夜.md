    The Days and Nights of National Higher Education Institutions
    (Our reporter Wei Wenhua reports) On the eve of National Day, hundreds of thousands of teachers, students, and staff at higher education institutions across the country are making leaps forward in learning, production, scientific research, and organizing militia training, doing everything possible to prepare gifts for this great festival. Labor Results Replace Slogans
    Before this year's National Day, the educational policy of serving the proletariat and combining education with productive labor has taken deep root in the hearts of the people in various schools. In recent months, teachers and students in various regions have gone to factories, rural areas, and mountains, and have generally established factories and farms within schools. According to incomplete statistics, 115 higher education institutions have established more than 3,700 factories. The factories that have already been built are currently processing and rushing to produce all kinds of products for the festival, and many new factories are springing up from the ground, striving to ignite the flames, start up machines, and celebrate National Day. In the past, during festivals, schools only had temporary slogans and banners made of paper. This year, these will be replaced by the labor results of teachers and students. In addition to general products, there are also advanced precision products and cutting-edge scientific achievements. In the capital of the motherland, student-made civilian aircraft will soar into the sky.
    Standing in the Ranks of the Great Battle for Steel
    Currently, the people of the whole country are engaged in a great battle for steel, and many school teachers and students are also participating in this battle. In order to welcome the festival, they are working day and night, stepping up steelmaking and iron production. Students from the Economics Department of Northwest University are fighting hard day and night to build a steel plant with an annual output of 10,000 tons, and have put forward the fighting slogan of "Fight hard for a month to let molten steel flow, and dedicate the first furnace of steel to National Day." Northeast Normal University, Jiaotong University (Xi'an section), Shandong University, Inner Mongolia University, Nankai University and other schools are all fighting day and night on the construction sites of iron and steel enterprises, some "guaranteeing the opening of the furnace before National Day," and others striving to "produce the first furnace of steel on National Day." Many people in higher education institutions in various places are also conducting scientific research for the steelmaking industry. Young teachers at the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology invented "antimony plating" in June, which has international significance, and are now concentrating on studying how to promote this invention to steel production, aiming to complete this research before "October 1st."
    Create Miracles for National Day, Annoy the Americans to Death
    In the past, scientific research work in higher education institutions was monopolized by a few bourgeois senior intellectuals, and young teachers and students were not allowed to get involved. Now, after teaching reform and academic criticism, this framework has been broken. Under the leadership of the Party, the scientific research work of the school implements the method of combining the Party committee, experts, and students. This makes scientific research work like an irresistible torrent, surging and rushing thousands of miles. In order to present gifts to the Party on National Day, the masses are showing their skills in scientific research. Since the end of August, more than 200 original higher education institutions across the country have launched a mass movement of "Welcoming National Day and Making a Big Fuss in Science." In more than a month, they have achieved brilliant victories. According to incomplete statistics from 48 higher education institutions in Beijing, Chongqing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Shanghai, Hefei and other places, more than 15,500 scientific research topics have been completed. Nineteen schools will complete more than 6,700 more projects before the "October 1st" National Day. From a quantitative point of view, this is simply incomparable to past achievements. For example, Beijing Normal University completed only 455 research topics in the past four years, but now it will complete more than 1,200 topics in more than a month. Peking University has completed more than 3,400 research topics in forty days, which is equivalent to the total number of research projects in the past ten years. From a quality point of view, a considerable part of it is a domestic initiative. According to incomplete statistics from seven higher education institutions, more than 430 projects have reached or exceeded international standards. More than 2,000 projects in more than 30 higher education institutions in the capital belong to cutting-edge technology and science fields. At present, schools in various places are organizing teachers and students to go to factories, rural areas, or continue to conduct research in the school's factories and farms, and at the same time collect and sort out the completed research results, preparing to exhibit them and present them to the Party as a gift. On the eve of National Day, scientific work in higher education institutions is blooming. The reporter saw in higher education institutions in Beijing that good news in scientific research is constantly pouring into the school's Party committee and the Party's general branch of the department. In this day of ten thousand horses galloping and miracles appearing, there will definitely be more and better research results before National Day. Some schools have even linked this heroic action with the current anti-aggression struggle in our country, proposing "Create miracles for National Day and annoy the Americans to death!"
    Arm Yourself to Protect Peace
    To defend the fruits of socialist motherland construction and not allow American imperialist war mongers to undermine our peaceful construction, students, teachers, and staff in higher education institutions in various places have organized themselves to carry out teaching, production, and scientific research with one hand, and hold guns to step up training with the other, preparing to accept the Party's review on National Day and demonstrate to American imperialism. The students are stepping up training and shooting activities to train themselves into true socialist fighters who are capable of writing, fighting, and working. Some militia organizations in Beijing have put forward "threeizations" (organization militarization, learning, work, and life combatization, production collectivization) and "five goods" (good learning and labor, good organizational discipline and safety, good unity and mutual assistance, good care of weapons, and good propaganda and mobilization). The militia organizations of higher education institutions in some places have put forward specific training requirements before National Day, striving to overfulfill them as part of the National Day gift to the Party.

    全国高等学校的日日夜夜
    本报讯　记者魏文华报道：国庆前夕，全国高等学校的几十万师生员工在学习、生产、科学研究、组织民兵练武等各方面奋勇跃进，为这个伟大的节日千方百计地准备礼品。劳动成果代替标语口号
    今年国庆前，教育为无产阶级服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的教育工作方针，已经在各学校深入人心。几个月来，各地学校的教师和学生下厂下乡上山，普遍地在学校内办工厂、农场，根据不完全统计，一百一十五所高等学校已办起三千七百多座工厂。目前已建成的工厂正为节日加工赶制各式各样的产品，还有许多新的工厂在平地而起，争取在国庆节点火喷烟，开动机器。以往的节日，在学校里只有临时用纸糊的标语、口号等，今年这些都要被师生们的劳动成果所代替。除了一般的产品外，还有高级的精密的产品和尖端科学成果，在祖国的首都，将有学生们自制的民航飞机上天翱翔。
    站在大战钢铁的行列里
    目前全国人民大战钢铁，许多学校的师生也参加这一战斗行列，为了迎接节日，他们日日夜夜，加紧炼钢出铁。西北大学经济系学生日夜苦战，兴建年产一万吨的炼钢厂，提出了“苦战一月让钢水奔流，用第一炉钢向国庆献礼”的战斗口号。东北师范大学、交通大学（西安部分）、山东大学、内蒙古大学、南开大学等校，在建设钢铁企业的工地上，都是不分日夜地在战斗，有的“保证在国庆日前开炉”，有的力争“国庆出第一炉钢”。各地高等学校许多人还为炼钢事业进行科学研究，北京钢铁学院青年教师在6月间发明了具有国际意义的“镀锑”，现在又集中力量研究把这项发明推广到钢的生产上去，要在“十一”前完成这项研究。
    国庆创奇迹　气死美国佬
    高等学校的科学研究工作，过去是被少数资产阶级高级知识分子所垄断，青年教师和学生一向不能问津。现在经教学改革和学术批判，这个框框已被打破，学校科学研究工作在党的领导下实行党委、专家、学生三结合的办法，这样就使科学研究工作如同一股不可阻挡的洪流，汹涌澎湃地直泻千里。群众为了在国庆日向党献礼，在科学研究方面大显身手。从8月下旬以来，全国原有的二百多所高等学校，都开展了“迎接国庆，大闹科学”的群众性运动，一个多月来取得辉煌的胜利，仅据北京、重庆、天津、西安、上海、合肥等地四十八所高等学校不完全的统计，已经完成的科学研究题目达一万五千五百多项，有十九所学校到“十一”国庆前还要再完成六千七百多项。从数量上看，这同过去的成就简直不可同日而语，如北京师范大学过去四年全校完成的研究题目只有四百五十五个，而现在一个多月就要完成一千二百多项。北京大学四十天中已完成了三千四百多项研究题目，相当于过去十年研究项目的总和。从质量上看，有不小的一部分是国内的创举，据七个高等学校不完全的统计其中达到或超过国际水平的项目达四百三十多个，首都三十多所高等学校属于尖端技术科学领域的有二千多项。目前各地学校一方面组织师生下厂下乡或在本校的工厂、农场继续进行研究，一方面把已完成的研究成果进行收集整理工作，准备展出，向党献礼。国庆前夕，高等学校的科学工作是百花齐放，记者在北京的高等学校看到，科学研究工作方面的喜报不断地涌到学校党委会和系的党总支，在这万马奔腾奇迹日出的今天，在国庆前一定会有更多更好的研究成果出现，有的学校更把这种豪迈的行动和目前我国反侵略斗争联系起来，提出“国庆创奇迹，气死美国佬！”
    武装起来保和平
    保卫社会主义祖国建设的果实，不允许美帝国主义战争贩子破坏我们的和平建设，各地高等学校的学生和教师员工，纷纷组织起来，一手进行教学、生产和科学研究，一手持枪加紧操练，准备在国庆日接受党的检阅，向美帝国主义示威。学生们加紧操练和射击活动，要把自己训练成为能文能武能劳动的真正的社会主义战士。北京有的学校民兵组织提出“三化”（组织军事化，学习、工作、生活战斗化，生产集体化）、“五好”（学习劳动好，组织纪律安全好，团结互助好，爱护武器好，宣传鼓动好），有的地方的高等学校民兵组织提出了国庆前具体的练兵要求，力争超额完成，作为国庆向党献礼的一部分。
