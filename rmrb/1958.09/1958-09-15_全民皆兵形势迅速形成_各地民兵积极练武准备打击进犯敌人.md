Xinhua News Agency, 14th: In recent days, a situation of all the people being soldiers is rapidly taking shape on an increasingly large scale. Militia units in various regions are launching a high tide of military training in conjunction with production. The militias are rapidly mastering military techniques and closely watching the situation in the Taiwan Strait. They are standing in battle readiness, prepared to cooperate with the Chinese People's Liberation Army at any time to strike any enemy who dares to invade.

At present, the backbone militias in the vast rural areas are mostly engaged in military training in various subjects. Many outstanding militia platoons, squads, and teams have emerged in various regions. The rural militias in Liaoning Province have generally received military training once. In Zhuanghe County, Stone Island Township in this province, the passing rate of militia training reached over 95%, with 40% being excellent. More than one million rural militias in Jilin Province, after hearing Premier Zhou's statement on the radio, have been training hard day and night. They are determined to complete the three-year training task in advance within a few months. They are not only practicing rifle shooting, but some militia battalions and companies are also stepping up their practice of machine gun and mortar shooting techniques. In the rural areas of Henan Province, which have already realized people's communes, each commune's division, regiment, battalion, and company (which are also production organizations) has recently been equipped with military instructors and a certain number of guns. All young and middle-aged commune members study basic military knowledge and conduct basic military training at fixed times every day. Hunan Province recently conducted a live ammunition shooting test throughout the province, and forty-six excellent live ammunition shooting townships emerged.

The newly formed militia forces of workers, students, government cadres, and citizens in many cities have also been stepping up military training in recent days. More than 4,600 militiamen in the steel capital of Anshan are intensifying steel production while striving to carry out military training. Nearly 100,000 young workers, students, and government cadres in Dalian and Lushun recently held military field training, learning military subjects such as night marching, air defense, and ambush. The militia battalion composed of 150 people from the Institute of Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is conducting military training while doing scientific research work. The women's battalion composed of hundreds of female workers from Zhengzhou No. 2 State Cotton Factory is also actively training in military techniques such as grenade throwing, shooting, and motorcycle driving.

During the training process, the militias in various regions also vigorously carried out technical revolution and created many weapons and training equipment. Huang Zhizhan, a backbone militiaman and demobilized soldier from the Mutuan Agricultural Cooperative in Liujiang County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, with the assistance of other workers, made two 75mm recoilless guns. The first batch of ten artillerymen trained with this gun has now learned the basic movements of using the gun. Tan Youjia, a demobilized soldier from Luocheng County, made a loess explosive, which not only supported water conservancy construction but also trained the blasting skills of the engineering soldiers.

At present, mass military training is being intensified on a wider scale. The vast number of militiamen have made oaths to the motherland: If the American aggressors dare to ignite the flames of war, they will cast a dragnet in one morning, and wherever the enemy comes from, they will be eliminated there!

    新华社14日讯　这几天以来，全民皆兵的形势正在越来越大的规模上急速地形成，各地的民兵队伍正结合生产广泛地掀起了大练兵的热潮。民兵们迅速掌握军事技术，密切注视着台湾海峡的局势，他们严阵以待，准备随时配合中国人民解放军打击敢于来犯的敌人。
    目前广大农村的基干民兵，大都在进行各种科目的军事训练，各地出现了许多优秀的民兵中队、分队和小队。辽宁全省农村的民兵已经普遍受过一次军事训练，这个省的庄河县石城岛乡民兵的训练及格率达到95％以上，优秀的占40％。吉林省农村一百多万民兵在听到周总理声明的广播后，日夜进行苦练，他们决心把三年的训练任务提前在几个月内完成。他们不仅练习步枪射击，有些民兵营、连还加紧练习机关枪、迫击炮的射击技术。在已经实现了人民公社化的河南省农村，最近每个公社的师、团、营、连（同时也是生产组织）都配备了军事教官和一定数量的枪支，全体青壮年社员每天都定时学习基本军事知识和进行基本的军事训练。湖南省最近在全省进行了一次实弹射击测验，出现了四十六个实弹射击优秀乡。
    许多城市的工人、学生、机关干部和市民新组成的民兵武装，这几天也都在加紧军事训练。钢都鞍山四千六百多名民兵，一面加紧生产钢铁，一面努力进行军事训练。近十万名旅大市青年工人、学生和机关干部，最近还举行了军事野营训练，学习夜行军、防空、伏击等军事科目。中国科学院土壤研究所一百五十人组成的民兵大队，一面作科学研究工作，一面进行军事训练。郑州国棉二厂几百名女工组成的妇女营也在积极训练投弹、射击、摩托驾驶等军事技术。
    各地民兵在训练过程中还大闹技术革命，创造了许多兵器和训练器材。广西僮族自治区柳江县木团农业社基干民兵、复员军人黄志占，在别的工人协助下，制成了两门七十五无后座力炮，用这门炮训练的第一批十个炮手，现在已学会用炮的基本动作。罗城县复员军人覃有家制成土黄色炸药，一面支援了水利建设，一面训练了工兵的爆破技术。
    目前群众性的军事训练工作正在更广泛的规模上加紧进行，广大民兵都向祖国发出誓言：如果美国侵略者敢于燃起战火，他们就会在一个早上撒下天罗地网，敌人从那里来，就把它消灭在那里！
