Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 23rd: Chehab, the new President of Lebanon, was sworn into office at a parliamentary session on the morning of the 23rd.

In his brief speech after being sworn in, he said that he would promote the early withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and make every effort to strengthen relations between Lebanon and all other Arab countries. Chehab said: "We will cooperate with all countries in the world on the basis of friendship, peace and equality. The Arab League Charter and the United Nations Charter are the two pillars of Lebanon's policy." However, he believes that the greater pillar is national unity. He wants to restore domestic security in Lebanon and collect weapons from all groups without discrimination.

Some opposition leaders in Lebanon have stated that they will not lay down their arms or give up the struggle until the American invading forces have withdrawn from Lebanon.

Chehab was then accompanied by Speaker of Parliament Oseiran to the Presidential Palace, where a handover ceremony between the new and outgoing presidents was held. With this, Camille Chamoun, the puppet president supported by the bayonets of the American occupation forces, who was universally hated by the Lebanese people, finally stepped down quietly.

Chehab was elected on July 31st. According to the Lebanese constitution, the president's term is six years.

    谢哈布就任黎巴嫩新总统
    表示将促使外国军队撤退
    新华社23日讯  贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩新任总统谢哈布23日上午在议会会议上宣誓就职。
    他在宣誓就职后发表的简短演说中说，他将促使外国军队早日撤出黎巴嫩，并且尽力加强黎巴嫩和所有其他阿拉伯国家之间的关系。谢哈布说：“我们将在友好和平等的基础上和世界各国合作。阿拉伯联盟公约和联合国宪章是黎巴嫩的政策的两大支柱。”但是，他认为，更大的支柱是国家的统一。他要恢复黎巴嫩的国内安全，并且无区别地收集所有集团的武器。
    黎巴嫩的一些反对派领袖，曾经表示在美国侵略军没有撤出黎巴嫩以前，将不放下武器，也不放弃斗争。
    谢哈布然后由议长奥塞兰陪同前往总统府，在那里举行了新旧总统接交仪式。至此，受到黎巴嫩人民普遍痛恨的、由美国占领军刺刀支持的傀儡总统夏蒙终于悄然下台。
    谢哈布是在7月31日当选的，根据黎巴嫩宪法，总统任期六年。
