A Record of the Transportation of the Blast Furnace Top
By Our Correspondent Cao Baoming

　　Just after the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant accepted the task of manufacturing the No. 1 Blast Furnace top equipment, Engineer Yu Wenhan of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) Equipment Department immediately went to the Ministry of Railways to resolve the transportation issue. He and the engineers from the Traffic Bureau and the Rolling Stock Bureau studied the national railway map for several days, but they couldn’t find a suitable solution. The reason was that the equipment was too large, with the largest diameter reaching 5.1 meters. If laid flat on the train, it would knock down all the automatic signal equipment on the double-track line. If placed upright, many bridge and mountain tunnels were not tall enough for it to pass through. Li Lei, a technician from the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, also rode his bicycle from Shenyang to Dalian, measuring the width and load-bearing capacity of highway bridges along the way, hoping to have the equipment towed to Dalian by tractors and then transferred by sea. However, this plan also failed because the equipment was too heavy, with the heaviest weighing 25 tons, which the highway bridges could not bear. Yu Wenhan even considered air transport, but where could they find an aircraft with a cargo door wider than 5 meters?

　　The transportation route hadn't been finalized yet, but WISCO decided to advance the iron production target to catch up with Britain, requiring them to shorten the original 45-day transportation period to within one month.

　　Engineer Wang Zhenmin of the Shenyang Railway Bureau came up with a clever solution for the double-track railway. Originally, no matter which track was used to reach Dalian, low bridges blocked the way. His plan was to have the train travel on one track for a certain distance, then switch to the other track, making the route resemble the Great Wall on a map. In this way, the train could bypass many obstacles and only pass through two tunnels, the lowest of which was 5.2 meters high. He then devised a way to reduce the loading height to 5.15 meters, so that the equipment could be transported to Dalian smoothly. To verify this hypothesis, he even built a high架 (jià - shelf, frame) on a freight car and tried running it on this route.

　　At this point, Yu Wenhan, who was responsible for the blast furnace equipment, truly felt that things had never gone so smoothly. The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, which had promised to deliver the goods by the end of June, had already advanced the deadline twice. They even specially built a large "Surpass Britain" vertical lathe to process the equipment, and further advanced the delivery to the 26th. To load these large pieces of equipment, three specially made "drop-hole cars" were needed, so the Ministry of Railways transferred six cars from Lanzhou, Guangzhou, and Beijing, allowing him to choose the best ones. The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant also helped him reduce the loading time from eight days to two and a half days. The Shenyang Railway Bureau also sent dispatcher Hu Guozhi to accompany him on the train.

　　As soon as train No. 5504 departed from Shenyang on June 30, the Ministry of Railways immediately issued another order, specifically stipulating the route, speed, and finally stating: "Train No. 5504 must arrive in Dalian before July 4. No delays are allowed at any stations along the way."

　　For the safety of the equipment, the train traveled very slowly, delaying many passing trains. At a small station near Dashiqiao, the stationmaster came to discuss with them: "You are going too slow. Would you like to stop for a few hours and wait for the express train to pass before continuing?" Before Yu Wenhan could answer, Hu Guozhi explained the situation of WISCO's advance iron production to catch up with Britain, saying: "You have been working on the railway for decades. Have you ever seen the Railway Bureau send someone to accompany the cargo owner? You probably haven't! WISCO's advance production has great international and domestic significance, which I'm sure you can see. Hurry up and let the train go!" Seeing that the dispatcher from the Railway Administration was saying this, the stationmaster had no choice but to say: "What if the express train is delayed?" "So be it, our catching up with Britain is more important!" The station immediately issued a signal and the train started moving.

　　The train arrived at Dashiqiao Station on the evening of July 1. The supports for the equipment had a large crack and needed immediate repair. They went to the stationmaster, who said: "You need a welding machine and oxygen, but the station doesn't have them." They then went to the station Party Secretary, who was unloading salt with the workers. Upon hearing that it was WISCO's cargo, he immediately mobilized the station workers to repair it, but there were still difficulties because the equipment was incomplete. At this time, Hu Guozhi called Director Bai in the bureau, who immediately replied: "Go to the stationmaster and say it's the opinion of the Railway Administration, mobilize the forces of nearby sections to support WISCO! If he can't organize them, the bureau chief will issue an order." The stationmaster immediately made an emergency phone call to the nearby engineering section and locomotive section, and these units immediately sent people with equipment to rush the repairs overnight. The train continued its journey the next morning.

　　What worried Yu Wenhan the most was passing through the 5.2-meter-high tunnel. The Railway Bureau also sent their best No. 6 driver to drive this section of the route. As soon as the train reached the tunnel, the driver immediately braked. They immediately divided the work. Yu Wenhan and his partner Xu Chengguang stood under the largest piece of equipment, watching the distance between it and the tunnel roof. The train conductor got out of the train to signal. The driver was still not at ease, and asked his assistant to climb onto the top of the locomotive to accurately gauge the distance, while he himself leaned out of the window to watch the conductor's signals before slowly starting the train. At this time, everyone's mood was very tense, watching as the equipment was only a few fingers away from touching the tunnel roof. The train passed through the tunnel step by step. As soon as the train passed the bridge, Yu Wenhan immediately climbed onto the locomotive and shook hands with the driver: "Thank you! You carefully and safely passed through the tunnel. Thank you very much!" The driver replied: "Is there any need to thank me? How many such large pieces of equipment does our country have? How can I not be careful?"

　　According to Yu Wenhan's original plan, the equipment would have to stay in Dalian for four or five days before being shipped. The reason was that it required a ship of 3,000 tons or more to load, and not all ships from Dalian to Shanghai were over 3,000 tons. If they were unlucky, they would have to wait. Who knew that they would arrive in Dalian at 2:00 AM on the 4th, and the Shanghai Maritime Bureau had already sent cadre Shi Tingjie to wait for them for several days. Shi Tingjie also told him: Their largest ship, the "Peace No. 45," had already loaded 4,000 tons of cargo. The captain, seeing a typhoon signal, wanted to immediately sail to Shanghai and then return to pick up this batch of equipment. However, the Maritime Bureau, fearing delays in WISCO's production, insisted that the ship wait in Dalian Port. They immediately held an on-site technical meeting on the ship to study how to load the equipment. The ship needed 24 six-meter-long sleepers. Shi Tingjie also went with him to the timber company, which immediately agreed to lend them 24 sleepers from their consignment of timber. In this way, they set sail at 10:00 AM on the 5th.

　　At this time, Yu Wenhan let Xu Chengguang accompany the ship alone, and he himself took a train overnight back to Wuhan to prepare for receiving the equipment. He did not return to Wuhan until the 12th, and the equipment had already crossed the Yellow Sea, passed through the Yangtze River, and arrived at WISCO's wharf on the 13th. They used three crawler tractors that day to tow the heavy equipment to the blast furnace construction site.

　　炉顶运送记
　　本报记者　曹葆铭
    制造一号高炉炉顶设备的任务，刚由沈阳重型机器厂承应下来，武钢设备处的余文翰工程师便连忙去找铁道部解决运输问题。他和车务局、车辆局的工程师们打开全国铁路图研究了几天，也没找出一个妥善的办法来。原因是这些设备太大，最大的直径达五公尺一，平着放在车上，会将双轨线上的自动信号设备全部撞倒；竖着放，好些桥洞、山洞都没它高，根本过不去。沈阳重型机器厂的技术员李雷也从沈阳骑着自行车到大连去，沿途观测公路桥梁的宽度和载重量，想让他们用拖拉机将这些设备拖到大连，然后再转海运。结果也因为这些设备太重，最重的达二十五吨，公路桥承载不起，也过不去。余文翰还想到空运，但哪有五公尺多阔的舱口的飞机呢？
    运输的线路还没找好，而武钢又决定提前出铁赶英国，要他们将原定的四十五天的运输期限压缩到一个月以内。
    沈阳铁路局的王振民工程师从双轨铁路上找出了个巧办法。本来，在这双轨线上，无论从哪条轨道到大连都有低矮的桥洞挡着，他就要列车在这条轨道上走一段，再在那条轨道上走一段，走的线路就跟地图上的长城一般。这样，列车就可绕过许多阻碍，只通过两个桥洞，而最低的一个也有五公尺二高。他再设法将装车高度降低为五点一五公尺，这些设备就可顺利地运到大连。为了证实这个假想，他还在一个车皮上搭起一个高架，试着在这条线路上开一趟。
    这时，负责高炉设备的余文翰真感到办事从来没有这样顺利过。答应在6月底交货的沈阳重型机器厂，已经将期限两次提前了，他们还专门造了一台“超英号”的大型立式车床来加工这些设备，并再提前在26日把货交齐。装这些大型设备需要三辆特制的“落下孔车”，铁道部便从兰州、广州、北京调来六辆，任凭他挑选。沈阳重型机器厂又帮助他将装车时间由八天压缩为两天半。沈阳铁路局又派了调度员胡国治同他一道跟车。
    这节（五五○四）列车在6月30日刚从沈阳出发，铁道部马上又发出一道命令，具体规定了线路、车速，最后讲：“五五○四列车限在7月4日以前到达大连，沿途各站不得阻延。
    为了设备的安全，这节列车走的很慢，把来来往往的许多车次都阻拦了。在大石桥附近的一个小站上，站长来同他们商量：“你们走的太慢，是不是停几小时，等特别快车过去了再走？”余文翰还没来得及答话，胡国治就把武钢提前出铁赶英国的情况向站长讲了一遍，说：“你办了几十年铁路，你啥时见铁路局派人跟着货主走过？该没见过吧！武钢提前生产在国际国内都有重大意义，想必你都见得到，快放车吧！”站长见管理局的调度员都这样讲，只好说：“特别快车误了点怎么办？”“误点就误点吧，我们赶英国要紧！”站上就马上发出信号，列车开动了。
    7月1日晚上到达大石桥车站。这些设备的支撑裂了个很大的缝子，需要马上修理。他们去找站长，站长说：“你们需要电焊机和氧气，站上没有。”他们又去找车站党委书记，党委书记正在同工人们一起卸盐，一听说是武钢的货物，便马上动员站上的工人来修理，但因为设备不全，也有困难。这时，胡国治给局里的白处长通了个电话，白处长马上回答说：“你去找站长，说管理局的意见，把附近各段的力量都组织起来支援武钢！如果他组织不起来，就由局长下命令。”站长马上紧急电话通知附近的工务段、机务段，这些单位都立即派人带了机具赶来，连夜突击。列车在第二天早晨又继续前进了。
    最使余文翰耽心的，还是过五公尺二的那个桥洞。铁路局也派了他们最好的六号司机来开这段路。车一到洞前，司机就马上把车刹住。他们立即分工，由余文翰和他的伙伴徐成光两人站在最大的设备下面，专门看着它和洞顶的距离，车长下车来打旗号。司机还不放心，又叫他的助手爬在机车顶上看准距离，他自己也从窗口探出头来望着车长的旗号，才将车子缓缓开动。这时，大家的心情都非常紧张，眼看着这些设备只差几个指头就快擦着洞顶了，列车就这样一步一步挨过洞去。车刚过桥洞，余文翰马上攀到机车上去跟司机握手：“谢谢你！你很小心的平安过了桥洞，非常感谢你！”司机却回答说：“这还用谢？我们国家有几台这样大的设备？不小心还行？”
    按照余文翰原来的想法，这些设备得在大连停留四、五天，才能开船。原因是它们必须三千吨以上的大船才能装载，而大连到上海的船只并不是每只都是三千吨以上的，碰得不巧就得等待。哪知他们4日早晨两点到达大连，上海海运局早就派了干部施廷杰在那里等了他们几天。施廷杰还告诉他：他们最大的和平四十五号轮，已装了四千吨货，船长见有台风信号，想马上开到上海，再回来接这批设备。但海运局怕耽误了武钢的生产，硬要这艘船在大连港等着。他们马上去船上开了个现场技术会，研究怎么装载这批设备。船上需要二十四根六公尺长的枕木，施廷杰又同他去找木材公司，木材公司也马上答应从他们托运的木材中借出二十四根来。这样，他们就在5日十点钟开船了。
    这时，余文翰让徐成光一人跟船，他自己连夜搭车赶回武汉准备迎接这批设备的事宜。他12日才回到武汉，这批设备就跨黄海，穿长江，在13日到达武钢码头了。他们当天开了三辆履带拖拉机，将这批笨重的设备拖到了高炉工地。
