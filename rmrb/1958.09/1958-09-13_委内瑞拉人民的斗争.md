    The Struggle of the Venezuelan People
    Venezuela Domingo González Landes
    In November 1948, a military group in Venezuela launched a coup, overthrowing the democratic government led by Rómulo Gallegos, the leader of the Democratic Action Party and a writer. A military junta was formed, headed by Colonel Delgado Chalbaud (who was assassinated soon after). The other two members of the junta were Pérez Jiménez and Llovera Páez. The Democratic Action Party was declared illegal, and many of its leaders were imprisoned and exiled. The Communist Party of Venezuela was also declared illegal because it had supported the Gallegos government, and its leaders were arrested and imprisoned or exiled. Those communists who escaped police arrest went underground.
    In 1952, Venezuela restarted elections for parliament and municipal councils. Most of the votes went to the Democratic Republican Union, a party of the petty bourgeoisie and professionals. Pérez Jiménez, using his position as Minister of Defense, secretly altered the votes, imprisoned and exiled the leaders of the Democratic Republican Union, and declared that the government's Independent Electoral Front had won a majority. Afterwards, Jiménez dissolved the military junta and declared himself interim president. On April 17, 1953, under Jiménez's manipulation, the constituent assembly elected him as president of the republic.
    After Jiménez came to power, with the support of the most reactionary forces in the military and the US imperialists and domestic groups closely connected with them, he implemented a dictatorial regime domestically and pursued policies beneficial to US imperialism externally.
    Because Venezuela ranks second in the capitalist world in oil production, the Jiménez dictatorial government handed over its rich oil resources to foreign, mainly US, oil monopolies. This income made the government leaders rich. In addition to oil, Venezuela also has abundant iron ore. However, these resources did not benefit the Venezuelan people. Imperialist economic forces penetrated all sectors of the national economy, extracting astonishing super-profits and preventing the development of Venezuelan industry. Venezuela's few factories, such as rubber factories, textile factories, and milk powder factories, were all owned by US monopolists. Imperialism also controlled Venezuela's banks and commerce. The various merchant ships that entered and exited the major ports every day also came from the United States and Europe.
    December 15, 1957, was the date for the presidential election. However, the Jiménez ruling clique wanted to continue to hold power, so they forced the parliament to pass a law beforehand, stipulating that a "national referendum" should be held on that day instead of a presidential election. The result of the vote was that Jiménez would continue as president for five years. This event shocked the whole country. With the participation of the Communist Party of Venezuela, people actively and secretly participated in the struggle against the Jiménez dictatorial regime, and formed a "Patriotic Civic Committee" representing the aspirations of all strata of the people. On January 1, 1958, a group of young pilots launched an armed coup against the Jiménez dictatorial regime at the Maracay Air Force Base, fifty miles from the capital Caracas. Because they did not coordinate with other troops, the navy, and the people, the coup failed. However, the people's struggle against the dictatorial regime became even more intense. On January 11, a crisis occurred in the Jiménez cabinet, and the Minister of Interior and the head of the secret police were ousted from the cabinet. On January 21, under the leadership of the "Patriotic Civic Committee," the Venezuelan people held a general strike and a massive popular resistance movement against the Jiménez dictatorial regime. After two days of fierce struggle, at three o'clock in the morning of the 23rd, Jiménez fled by military plane to Trujillo City, the capital of the Dominican Republic. This dictatorial regime, hated by the Venezuelan people, was finally overthrown, and a military committee composed of five military personnel and two civilians was established (soon after, due to pressure from the masses, two military personnel withdrew from the committee, reducing the number of members to five). Rear Admiral Larrazábal, forty-four years old, is the chairman of the military committee. The principal difference between this military committee and the former government is that it is guiding the country towards democratic constitutionalism.
    After the overthrow of the Jiménez dictatorial tyrant, the people cheered in the streets. Two thousand political prisoners were released, and three thousand exiles have already returned home. Now, the military committee has taken some democratic measures. All political parties, trade unions, and student organizations are actively participating in political life. A national unity movement, including members of the Communist Party and the Social Christian Party, supports the current government in the general election to be held in November this year.
    The strength of the Communist Party of Venezuela has developed rapidly and it has great influence among the masses. It is the standard-bearer of the Venezuelan people's anti-American and national liberation struggle. The anti-American sentiment of the Venezuelan people of all strata is growing. The visit of US Vice President Nixon was met by huge protest crowds. Nixon had to leave the country ahead of schedule. However, the reactionary forces in the army, the pro-American reactionary groups, and US imperialism are still constantly trying to destroy the independence and democracy that the Venezuelan people have already achieved. In July, a conspiracy group headed by the then Minister of Defense Castro León attempted to launch a new coup, but the unity of the people crushed this conspiracy. A national general strike was held, and the navy also supported the current government. The rebels were finally expelled from the country.
    Venezuela is living in an important historical era. The struggle of the Venezuelan people is not alone; it has won the support of all peace-loving people in the world. As long as we are more united and fight to defend national independence and democratic freedom, we will surely be able to crush any conspiracy by domestic and foreign reactionaries to subvert the current government.

    委内瑞拉人民的斗争
    委内瑞拉  多明哥·贡萨列兹·蓝台斯
    1948年11月，委内瑞拉一个军人集团发动政变，推翻了民主行动党领袖、作家罗慕洛·加莱哥斯所领导的民主政府，组成以德尔加多·加尔巴乌特上校（不久被刺）为首的军政府。军政府的另外两个成员是佩雷兹·希门尼斯和约柏拉·巴埃斯。民主行动党被宣布为非法，这个党的很多领袖被监禁和流放。委内瑞拉共产党因为曾支持加莱哥斯政府，也被宣布为非法，党的领导人被捕入狱或被流放。那些幸免于警察逮捕的共产党员都转入地下活动。
    1952年，委内瑞拉重新开始议会和市议会的选举，选票大部分集中在小资产阶级和自由职业者的政党——共和民主联盟的手中。佩雷兹·希门尼斯利用国防部长的职权，私改选票，监禁和流放共和民主联盟的领导人，宣布政府的独立选举阵线占多数。之后，希门尼斯解散了军政府，宣布自己为临时总统。1953年4月17日，在希门尼斯的操纵下，制宪议会又选举他为共和国总统。
    希门尼斯上台后，得到军队中最反动的势力和美帝国主义及国内同美帝国主义有密切联系的集团的支持，对内实行专制独裁，对外执行有利于美帝国主义的政策。
    由于委内瑞拉的石油产量居资本主义世界第二位，希门尼斯独裁政府把丰富的石油资源拱手租让给外国，主要是美国石油垄断资本。这笔收入使政府的头目们发财致富。委内瑞拉除了石油以外，还有丰富的铁矿。但是，这些资源并没有造福于委内瑞拉人民。帝国主义的经济势力渗入国民经济各部门，获取惊人的超额利润，并使委内瑞拉的工业无法发展。委内瑞拉仅有的几家工厂，如橡胶厂、纺织厂、乳粉厂等，都是属于美国垄断资本家的。帝国主义还控制了委内瑞拉的银行和商业。每天在各大港口进出的各种商船也都是从美国和欧洲来的。
    1957年12月15日是改选总统的日期，但是，希门尼斯统治集团想继续掌握政权，就迫使议会事先通过法令，规定在这天举行“全民投票”来代替总统选举。表决的结果是希门尼斯继任总统五年。这件事震动了全国，在委内瑞拉共产党的参加下，人们积极而秘密地参加反对希门尼斯独裁政权的斗争，并且组成了一个代表各阶层人民愿望的“公民爱国委员会”。1958年1月1日，一群青年飞行员在离首都加拉加斯五十英里的马拉凯空军基地发动反对希门尼斯独裁政权的武装政变。由于没有和其他部队、海军和人民配合，这次政变失败了。但是，人民群众反对独裁政权的斗争更加高涨。1月11日，希门尼斯内阁发生危机，内政部长和秘密警察局长都被赶出内阁。1月21日，在“公民爱国委员会”的领导下，委内瑞拉人民举行了反对希门尼斯独裁政权的总罢工和声势浩大的群众性反抗运动。经过两天的激烈斗争，在23日清晨三点钟，希门尼斯乘军用飞机逃往多米尼加共和国首都特鲁希约城。这个为委内瑞拉人民所痛恨的独裁政权终于被推翻，成立了包括五个军人和两个文职人员的军事委员会（不久以后，由于人民群众的压力，两个军人退出委员会，委员减至五人），四十四岁的海军少将拉腊萨巴耳是军事委员会的主席。这个军事委员会同从前的政府的原则上的区别就是：它把国家导向民主立宪。
    希门尼斯独裁暴君被推翻后，人民在街头尽情地欢呼。两千名政治犯被释放了，三千名流亡者也已经回国。现在，军事委员会已经采取了一些民主措施。所有的政党、工会以及学生组织都积极参加政治生活。一个包括有共产党员和社会天主教党党员参加的民族联盟运动支持现政府在今年11月举行的大选。
    委内瑞拉共产党的力量有飞速的发展，并且在人民群众中有极大的影响。它是委内瑞拉人民反美和民族解放斗争的旗手。委内瑞拉各阶层人民的反美情绪日益高涨。美国副总统尼克松的访问受到巨大抗议队伍的接待。尼克松不得不提前离开这个国家。但是，军队里的反动势力和亲美的反动集团以及美帝国主义仍然不断想摧毁委内瑞拉人民已经获得的独立和民主。7月间，以当时的国防部长卡斯特罗—莱昂为首的阴谋集团企图发动新的政变，但是，人民的团结一致粉碎了这个阴谋。全国举行总罢工，海军也支持现政府，叛乱分子终于被驱逐出境。
    委内瑞拉生活在一个历史的重要时代。委内瑞拉人民的斗争并不孤单，它获得了世界上一切爱好和平的人民的支持。只要我们更加团结一致地为保卫民族独立和民主自由而斗争，就一定能粉碎国内外反动派任何妄图颠复现政府的一切阴谋。
