Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 23rd: Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement has sparked a new high tide in the anti-American imperialist aggression movement among the people of Guangzhou. In recent days, people from all walks of life have gathered to transform their anger into strength, determined to completely crush the military provocations of American imperialism.

    At the construction site of the Guangzhou Shipyard's steelmaking converter, which successfully produced steel on the 19th, the workers' spirit of opposing American imperialist aggression soared. After American imperialism continued to increase its troops in the Taiwan Strait and Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement was issued, they proposed to rush to start the furnace, quickly blow the steel, and produce more steel, striving to achieve the goal of producing a thousand tons of steel per day, using practical actions to strike back at the American aggressors.
    The members of the Tangxia Cooperative in the suburbs of Guangzhou, which Chairman Mao visited this April, after reading Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement in the newspaper, made a vow in the fields, determined to practice martial arts and produce at the same time, ensuring that they have both people and grain when needed. In the Sanyuanli People's Commune, militiamen who are stepping up their practice of artillery range technology, after seeing Dulles's nonsense in the newspaper, were all filled with righteous indignation, expressing their intention to complete the technical training course within ten days, ready to enlist at any time and strike a heavy blow against the American aggressors. The officers and soldiers of the army stationed in the Guangzhou area are launching a vigorous training movement. The officers and soldiers of the air force units, who have won consecutive victories in the skies over South China, are determined to continue to inflict devastating blows on any American aerial bandits who dare to invade.
    Yesterday, gatherings were also held in various institutions of higher learning in Guangzhou. The South China Agricultural College also held a military parade for the militia division, attended by more than 2,000 people. Professor Huang Weisheng, deputy director of the Animal Husbandry Department, riding a horse and carrying a gun, reviewed the cavalry team. In his speech after the parade, he said: "We must transform anger into action. Today's parade is a manifestation of our powerful strength. The Chinese people are fully capable of crushing any provocative acts by American imperialism." The South China Institute of Technology and the Chemical Engineering College held a radio rally supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement from 8:00 p.m. on the 21st until the early hours of yesterday.
    The Guangdong Provincial People's Organizations and the local organizations of the democratic parties in Guangdong Province also held gatherings and issued statements yesterday, solemnly refuting Dulles's shameless lies.

    新华社广州23日电　陈毅外长的声明激起了广州市人民反对美帝国主义侵略运动的新高潮。各界人民连日来纷纷集会，决心化愤怒为力量，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的军事挑衅。
    在19日胜利出钢的广州造船厂炼钢转炉的工地上，工人们反对美帝国主义侵略的气概冲天，在美帝国主义继续增兵台湾海峡和陈毅外长声明发表以后，他们提出要抢开炉、快吹炼、多出钢，向日产千吨钢铁的目标奋勇前进，以实际行动回击美国侵略者。
    毛主席今年4月访问过的广州市郊区棠下社的社员们从报上看到陈毅外长的声明后，在田头发出誓言，决心一面练武，一面生产，做到要人有人要粮有粮。在三元里人民公社，正在加紧操练炮兵射程技术的民兵们，从报上看到杜勒斯的谰言后，个个义愤填胸，表示要在十天内完成技术操练课程，随时准备应征，痛击美国侵略者。驻广州地区的陆军官兵们正在展开如火如荼的练兵运动。在华南上空连战连捷的空军部队的官兵们，决心继续给敢于来犯的美国空中强盗以毁灭性打击。
    在广州市的各个高等院校，昨天也纷纷举行集会。华南农学院还举行了二千多人参加的民兵师阅兵典礼。畜牧系副主任黄伟胜教授，骑着骏马背着枪检阅骑兵队，他在阅兵后的讲话中说：“我们一定要化愤怒为行动。今天的阅兵就是我们强大力量的表现。中国人民完全有力量粉碎美帝国主义的任何挑衅行为。”华南工学院、化工学院从21日晚上八时直到昨天凌晨都在举行拥护陈毅外长声明的广播大会。
    广东省各人民团体和各民主党派广东省地方组织昨天也都纷纷举行集会和发表声明，严正驳斥杜勒斯的无耻谰言。
