　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 9th: In the great leap forward in local iron production, Ningde County, Fujian Province, has established a large number of "mother-child furnaces," "sister factories," and "collaborative furnaces." Through large-scale collaboration between furnaces and factories, they have overcome difficulties in ironmaking technology, equipment, and raw materials and fuel, driving all local blast furnaces in the county to rapidly begin production.

　　Ningde County is a county with no ironmaking foundation whatsoever. Recently, the county built 111 local blast furnaces, and about 80% of the townships have self-built and self-operated ironmaking plants. At the beginning, due to poor collaboration, there were phenomena such as many furnaces being built but little iron being produced, and the masses' enthusiasm was high, but technical experience lagged behind production. Based on this situation, the Ningde County Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted the method of replacing individual work with collaboration and replacing decentralized operations with joint operations. They divided the county into six collaboration zones, with the key factories in the collaboration zones as the core to form local iron production guidance groups. All factories and furnaces in the collaboration zone were organized as a whole and incorporated into the guidance scope of the collaboration zone in three forms. The first form is to establish "mother-child furnaces" within a factory, using the "mother furnace" to create experience and guide the "child furnace" in production. The second form is to establish cooperative relationships between factories, called "sister factories." Each advanced factory is responsible for guaranteeing, teaching, and ensuring production for the backward factories. Another form is that communes and townships jointly run "collaborative furnaces" and "collaborative factories." Based on technical equipment conditions and the distribution of raw materials and fuels, the communes and townships in the collaboration zone respectively invest manpower, materials, and financial resources to equip the local blast furnaces that lack equipment or have insufficient supply of raw materials and fuels.

　　This large-scale collaboration method of vigorously developing "mother-child furnaces," "sister factories," and "collaborative furnaces" has played a significant role in guiding the decentralized production of local blast furnaces. The total output of local iron in the county increased from 35 tons on August 21 to 89.96 tons on August 29, an increase of one and a half times in eight days.

　　According to the experience gained by the county party committee in the Qidu collaboration zone, doing a good job in "mother-child furnaces" and "sister factories" can "drive a factory with one furnace and drive several factories with one factory," driving each level, and finally enabling all furnaces and factories to step into the ranks of the advanced. At present, among the 111 local blast furnaces that have been built in the county, there are 73 collaborative furnaces jointly operated by communes, 9 jointly operated by townships and communes, and 5 jointly operated by counties, townships, and communes. The common characteristics of these three types of "collaborative furnaces" are: First, they highly concentrate the manpower, materials, and financial resources of the masses, accumulating small capital to do big things. Second, they can make full use of resources and power. After Ningde County established "collaborative furnaces," all water pumps and water turbines were utilized. Areas with fuel but no furnace, and areas with iron sand but no furnace, have also been organized into the ranks of ironmaking.

### 层层抓协作　炉炉早出铁  宁德县大办母子炉、姐妹厂、协作炉

　　层层抓协作　炉炉早出铁
    宁德县大办母子炉、姐妹厂、协作炉
    据新华社福州9日电　福建省宁德县在土铁生产大跃进中，大量创办“母子炉”、“姐妹厂”和“协作炉”，通过炉与炉、厂与厂的大协作，克服了炼铁技术、设备和原料、燃料等困难，带动全县土高炉迅速投入生产。
    宁德县是一个没有任何炼铁基础的县份。最近全县建成土高炉一百一十一座，约有80％以上的乡有了自建自办的炼铁厂。开始的时候，由于协作没有搞好，曾出现建炉多、炼铁少，群众干劲高，而技术经验落后于生产等的现象。中共宁德县委根据这种情况，采取了以协作代替单干，以联合经营代替分散经营的办法。他们把全县划分为六个协作区，以协作区的重点厂为核心组成土铁生产指导小组，把协作区内所有厂、炉组成一个整体，分别采用三种形式纳入协作区的指导范围以内。第一种形式是在一个厂内建立“母子炉”，通过“母炉”创造经验，指导“子炉”生产。第二种形式是在厂际之间建立协作关系，叫做“姐妹厂”。各先进厂对落后厂负有保教、包学、包生产的任务。还有一种形式是社与社、乡与乡合办“协作炉”、“协作厂”，根据技术设备条件和原料、燃料分布情况，由协作区内各乡社分别投入人力、物力、财力，把设备不足或原料、燃料供不应求的土高炉装备起来。
    这种大搞“母子炉”、“姐妹厂”、“协作炉”的大规模协作方法，对于指导分散的土高炉生产起了显著的作用。全县土铁总产量由8月21日的三十五吨增加到29日的八十九点九六吨，八天增加一倍半。
    据县委在七都协作区获得的经验，搞好“母子炉”、“姐妹厂”，就可以由“一炉带一厂，一厂带数厂”，层层带动，最后使所有的炉和厂都能迈上先进的行列。目前，全县已建成的一百一十一座土高炉中，社与社合营的协作炉有七十三座，乡与社合营的九座，县、乡、社合办的五座。这三种“协作炉”的共同特长是：第一，高度集中了群众人力、物力、财力，积小资办大事。第二，可以充分利用资源和动力。宁德县创办“协作炉”以后，所有的抽水机、水轮机都被利用起来。有燃料没有炉，有铁砂没有炉的地区，也都分别组织到炼铁的行列中来了。
