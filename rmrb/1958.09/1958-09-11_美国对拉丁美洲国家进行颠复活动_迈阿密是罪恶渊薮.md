The coastal city of Miami in southern Florida, on the east coast of the United States, used to be a paradise for wealthy Americans to relax. Now it has become a base for Washington's subversive activities against Latin American countries.

A report by "Newsweek" reporter Immerson confirmed that the rebellion of Haitian counter-revolutionaries in August was planned and launched here. At that time, six of the eight rebels who attacked a barracks near the Haitian presidential palace were former police officers from Dade County (where Miami is located). Moreover, Immerson said: "Conspiracies against other Latin American regimes are also launched in Dade County."

Miami harbors thousands of Latin American outcasts. These reactionary elements, spurned by the people, are constantly organizing "expeditions" against Latin American countries under the protection of the U.S. authorities. Immerson reported on their activities: This group of fanatical "revolutionaries" are busy smuggling arms, plotting revenge, and organizing expeditionary forces. Not only do they enjoy all kinds of supplies, but they also enjoy preferential treatment that ordinary Americans do not. For example, the Venezuelan dictator Jiménez, who fled here, owns a heavily guarded residence in Miami worth $400,000. From here, he is constantly plotting a comeback.

In Miami, arms dealers openly sell arms, which are surplus materials from the U.S. Department of the Army during World War II. The variety is unbelievable. Immerson said this includes "machine guns, artillery, vehicles, and even tanks." These materials are ostensibly sold as scrap, but "weapons experts can easily restore them to combat effectiveness."

One arms dealer listed his wares as follows: "Ready for immediate delivery to anywhere in Latin America," ninety Sherman M-4 heavy tanks, priced at $47,500 each. Each tank is equipped with three .30 caliber machine guns and one .50 caliber machine gun, and can also be equipped with a 75 mm gun.

### 美国对拉丁美洲国家进行颠复活动  迈阿密是罪恶渊薮

    美国对拉丁美洲国家进行颠复活动
    迈阿密是罪恶渊薮
    本报讯　美国东海岸南部佛罗里达州的滨海城市迈阿密，原是美国富豪消闲的乐园。现在已成为华盛顿对拉丁美洲各国进行颠复活动的基地。
    据美国“新闻周刊”记者伊默尔逊的报道证实了今年8月里海地反革命分子的叛乱就是在这里筹划和发动的。当时进攻海地总统府附近一个兵营的由八人组成的一支叛军中，就有六名是以前（迈阿密所属迪县）的警官。不仅如此，伊默尔逊说：“针对着其它拉丁美洲政权的阴谋也是在迪县发动的。”
    在迈阿密，收容着成千的拉丁美洲人民的败类，这些被人民唾弃的反动分子，在美国当局的庇护下，不断地组织对拉丁美洲各国的“远征”。伊默尔逊报道他们的活动说：这一群狂热的“革命分子”忙于偷运军火、阴谋策划报复和组织远征军。”他们不但得到一切供应上的方便，并且享着一般美国人民所享受不到的优待。例如逃亡在此的委内瑞拉独裁者希门尼斯，在迈阿密拥有一所价值四十万美元的警卫森严的住宅。从这儿，他不断地策划着复辟的阴谋。
    在迈阿密，军火掮客们公开推销军火，这些军火都是美国陆军部在第二次大战中的剩余物资，其品种之多难以令人置信。伊默尔逊说，其中包括“机枪、大炮、车辆以至坦克。”这些物资表面上是以废品形式出售，但是“武器专家可以轻易地使它们回复战斗力。”
    一个军火掮客曾列出他的货色价单如下：“可以立刻向拉丁美洲任何地方交货的”九十辆薛尔曼M—4式重型坦克，每辆售价四万七千五百美元。每辆坦克上装备有三支三十公厘口径的机枪和一挺五十公厘口径的机枪，还可以装上一门七十五公厘的炮。
