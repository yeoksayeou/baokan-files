Awaiting the Motherland's Call
　　Ba Ren
　　
    This provocation by U.S. imperialism is not accidental; it is a link in its global aggressive deployment. Since U.S. imperialism's dispatch of troops to Lebanon in an attempt to ignite a war in the Middle East, it has aroused protests, condemnations, and opposition from people all over the world and socialist countries, thoroughly isolating itself. This forced it to agree to the Arab countries' proposal at the UN General Assembly's emergency meeting. It was also at this time that U.S. imperialism attempted to shift the world's people's focus, actively preparing to attack our country. Now it even clamors that it has the "right" to invade our country's inland sea islands, Jinmen and Mazu. We are very clear that when Japanese imperialism invaded China, their slogan was that to dominate the world, one must dominate Asia, and to dominate Asia, one must dominate China. The ambition of U.S. imperialism to dominate the world starts with dominating our country! Dulles's statement is a blatant expression of this ambition! But the Chinese people today are different from the Chinese people of decades ago! The Chinese people are people with a high degree of political consciousness and a high ideal of life. They are invincible warriors who will fight for their beautiful communist ideals. The Chinese people know to cherish their motherland as they cherish their own eyes, to cherish the Communist Party and the government that lead the motherland forward, and will never allow the enemy to touch a single hair on our heads! If U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war, then the Chinese people have full confidence that even if there are ten or a hundred U.S. imperialisms, we can resolutely, thoroughly, and cleanly eliminate them!

    The Chinese people have now been mobilized from every street to every street, from every factory to every factory, from every village to every village, from every mine and fishing village to every mine and fishing village. We are ready at any time, awaiting the motherland's call at any time! We will annihilate the enemy wherever they come from! And we will recover the coastal islands of Jinmen and Mazu whenever we want, and we will recover Taiwan and the Penghu Islands whenever we want!

    Eisenhower! Dulles! If you dare to interfere in our internal affairs, you will surely suffer a crushing defeat!

　　听候祖国的召唤
    巴人
    美帝国主义这次挑衅，不是偶然的，是它全世界侵略部署的一个环节。自美帝国主义进兵黎巴嫩企图在中东挑起一场战争以来，引起了全世界人民和社会主义国家的抗议、谴责和反对，使自己彻底陷入孤立；这就不得不在联大紧急会议上同意阿拉伯国家的提案；也就在这时美帝国主义企图转移世界人民的目标，积极准备进攻我国，现在居然叫嚷，要对我国的内海岛屿金门和马祖列岛，有进行侵略的“权利”了。我们非常了解：当日本帝国主义侵略中国的时候，他们的口号是，要独霸世界就得独霸亚洲，而要独霸亚洲，就得独霸中国。美帝国主义独霸世界的野心，就是以独霸我国为出发点！杜勒斯的声明就是这个野心的露骨的表白！但今天中国的人民已不同于几十年前的中国人民了！中国人民是有高度的政治觉悟，有高度的生活理想的人民，是要为自己美好的共产主义理想而奋斗的、不可战胜的战士。中国人民知道像爱护自己的眼珠似的爱护自己的祖国，爱护领导祖国前进的共产党和政府，决不容许敌人动我们一根汗毛！如果美帝国主义敢于发动战争，那么中国人民有充分的信心，那怕有十个美帝国主义，一百个美帝国主义也能把它们坚决、彻底、干净地消灭掉！
    中国人民现在已经从每一个街道到每一个街道，从每一个工厂到每一个工厂，从每一个乡村到每一个乡村，从每一个矿场、渔村到每一个矿场、渔村，都动员起来了，我们随时准备着，随时听候着祖国的号召！随时把敌人从那里来就把它歼灭在那里！并且要在什么时候就在什么时候收复沿海岛屿金门和马祖，要在什么时候就在什么时候收复台湾和澎湖列岛！
    艾森豪威尔！杜勒斯！你们胆敢干涉我们的内政一定要碰得头破血流！
