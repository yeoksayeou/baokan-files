Rushing to the Steel Front to Show Their Skills
Over 20,000 Geological Testing Personnel Set Off One After Another
(People's Daily News) In order to rapidly improve the technological level of iron ore mining, iron smelting, and steelmaking in the steel industry, and to ensure the completion of the great task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year, the State Council recently decided to transfer over 20,000 higher and secondary school students majoring in geology, chemical engineering, and chemistry, as well as some faculty members, to participate in the mass movement of running the steel industry by the whole people in various regions. Prior to this, the state had already assigned over 10,000 graduates from higher and secondary metallurgical professional schools and transferred over 5,000 students from higher and secondary metallurgical professional schools to the steel front in various regions.
    The State Council's recent steel production meeting decided that the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry should jointly study and, with the consent of the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, immediately transfer 10,000 students majoring in chemistry and chemical engineering and a certain number of faculty members from higher and secondary technical schools across the country to form over 2,000 analysis and testing teams. They will bring their own instruments and equipment and go to the steel front in various regions. They will help various regions analyze and test the composition of raw materials and products such as iron ore, manganese ore, limestone, coke, coal, pig iron, and steel, so as to enable various regions to carry out production effectively and normally, and rapidly increase steel production. They will also help various regions train testing and analysis personnel. The Beijing area has transferred a total of more than 3,400 testing and analysis personnel, ranking first in the country. Peking University has played an exemplary role in this work, transferring a total of more than 800 students and faculty members from the school to the steel front.
    The meeting also decided that the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Geology, and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry should jointly study and, with the consent of relevant provinces and cities, immediately transfer 10,000 students majoring in geological prospecting, exploration, hydrology, and geophysical prospecting, as well as a certain number of faculty members, from the three geological exploration colleges in Beijing, Changchun, and Chengdu and the eight secondary geological professional schools in Changchun, Nanjing, Xi'an, Kunming, Chongqing, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. They will bring their own equipment and instruments and participate in production at mines in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and help guide mining and prospecting work in various regions. Currently, the three geological exploration colleges in Beijing, Changchun, and Chengdu have transferred more than 7,400 students and faculty members, and the eight secondary geological professional schools have transferred more than 3,100 students and faculty members.
    In addition, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has also transferred a group of analysis and testing technical personnel from fourteen steel plants such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Baotou Iron and Steel, and three steel and non-ferrous metal research institutes, adopting the method of one enterprise or one research institute contracting one or two provinces (autonomous regions), to establish central analysis and testing stations in twenty-two provinces (autonomous regions) and hold chemical analysis training courses. Their task is to cultivate technical forces, help establish testing work in special districts, counties, and enterprises, guide students assigned to various regions to carry out business, and undertake more complex analysis and testing work.
    The Ministry of Railways has also transferred more than 70 analysis and testing personnel to undertake analysis and testing work in some areas along the railway lines.
    At present, the transfer and organization of geological and analysis and testing personnel in various regions has been basically completed. This strong technical force will go to various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions before September 22 to participate in the intense labor of fighting for steel.

    赶赴钢铁前线显身手
    两万多地质化验人员纷纷出发
    本报讯　国务院为了迅速提高钢铁工业采矿、炼铁、炼钢的生产技术水平，保证完成今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的伟大任务，最近决定抽调二万多名高等、中等地质、化工、化学专业的在校学生和一部分教职员，分赴各地参加全民办钢铁的群众运动。在这以前，国家已经分配了一万多名高等、中等冶金专业的毕业学生，抽调了五千多名高等、中等冶金专业学校的在校学生，投入各地钢铁前线。
    国务院最近召开的钢铁生产会议，决定由教育部、冶金工业部会同研究，并商得各省、市、自治区同意以后，立即从全国各高等、中等技术学校抽调一万名化学、化工专业的学生和一定数量的教职员，组成二千多个分析化验小组，自带仪器设备，分赴各地钢铁前线。他们将帮助各地分析化验铁矿石、锰矿、石灰石、焦炭、煤、生铁、钢等原材料、产品的成份，以便各地有效地、正常地进行生产，迅速地提高钢铁产量，并且帮助各地训练化验、分析人员。北京地区抽调的化验分析人员共三千四百多人，占全国第一位；北京大学在这一工作中起了模范作用，共从校内抽调了八百多名学生和教职员投入钢铁战线。
    会议还决定，由教育部、地质部、冶金部会同研究，并商得有关省、市同意以后，立即从北京、长春、成都的三个地质勘探学院和长春、南京、西安、昆明、重庆、郑州、武汉、广州等地八个中等地质专业学校，抽调一万名地质普查、勘探、水文、物理探矿等专业的学生和一定数量的教职员，自带设备、仪器，到各省、市、自治区的矿山参加生产，并且帮助各地指导采矿、找矿等工作。现在，北京、长春、成都的三个地质勘探学院已经抽调学生、教职员七千四百多人，八个中等地质专业学校已经抽调学生、教职员三千一百多人。
    另外，冶金工业部还从鞍钢、武钢、包钢等十四个钢铁工厂和三个钢铁、有色金属研究院中，抽调了一批分析化验技术人员，采取一个企业或一个研究院包一两个省（自治区）的办法，到二十二个省（自治区）去建立中心化验分析站，举办化学分析训练班。他们的任务是培养技术力量，帮助建立专区、县及企业的化验工作，指导分派到各地的学生开展业务，并且担任比较复杂的分析化验工作。
    铁道部也抽调了七十多名分析化验人员，承担铁路沿线一些地区的分析化验工作。
    目前，各地地质、化验分析人员的抽调、组织工作已经基本完成。这一批雄厚的技术力量，将于9月22日以前分赴各省、市、自治区，参加到为钢铁而战的紧张劳动中去。
