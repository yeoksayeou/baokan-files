Xinhua News Agency, September 27th, New York. TASS, September 27th, New York: To celebrate the 39th anniversary of the founding of the American Communist Party, a mass rally was held last night in New York's largest music hall, Carnegie Hall. At the rally, a recorded speech by William Z. Foster, Honorary Chairman of the American Communist Party, was played. He said, "Shortly after the Russian Revolution dealt a crushing blow to the world capitalist system, the American Communist Party was born. Throughout its difficult and stormy period since its founding, the American Communist Party has suffered cruel persecution from the most powerful imperialist oppressors and has fought against the deceptive illusions propagated by decadent capitalism. Therefore, the Party can be completely proud of its contributions to the struggle of workers against war, fascism, and organized reaction... The American Communist Party has withstood the attacks of imperialist reactionaries, and now, as the whole world is rapidly transitioning from a capitalist basis to a socialist basis, it will once again play its inherent role..."

The General Secretary of the American Communist Party, Dennis, pointed out in his speech that the current Far East crisis is the result of the US imperialist policy of aggression. He said that the Eisenhower administration is pursuing a provocative and bellicose policy. The situation created by this policy has caused widespread concern among the masses and many Americans, who undoubtedly hold anti-war sentiments.

Dennis went on to say that the US ruling clique is attempting to use reckless provocations in the Far East to cover up the failures of Eisenhower and Dulles' doctrines. However, the firm will of the people can prevent war. After pointing out the peace initiatives of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, he said that the American Communist Party will do everything in its power to fight for peace.

Davis, a member of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, emphasized the role of the American Communist Party in the struggle for Black rights and for Black equality. He sternly condemned the Eisenhower administration for failing to take measures to stop the increasingly barbaric insults against Black people, especially Black youth. He said that the US government's domestic and foreign policies are disastrous. He advocated that if the President does not end the practices that put the country on the brink of disaster in his domestic and foreign policies, he should be handed over to the Senate for impeachment.

A resolution was passed at the meeting demanding that the United States withdraw from Taiwan and other coastal islands of China and remove all its naval and land forces from the Western Pacific region. In two other resolutions, the meeting called for amnesty for political prisoners and demanded that the United States stop supporting the Cuban dictator Batista.

The meeting warmly welcomed congratulatory messages from fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties in many countries, including the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, France, India, Japan, Tunisia, Colombia, Norway, the Netherlands, Canada, and Argentina. These congratulatory messages were published in the "Worker's Weekly."

    纽约盛会庆祝美共建党三十九周年
    通过决议要求美国撤出台湾
    丹尼斯说远东危机是美国侵略政策造成
    新华社27日讯  塔斯社纽约27日讯：为庆祝美国共产党三十九周年，昨天晚间在纽约最大的音乐厅——卡内基音乐厅举行了群众大会，在大会上放送了美国共产党名誉主席福斯特的录音讲话，他说，“在俄国革命给予世界资本主义体系一蹶不振的打击后，不久美国共产党就诞生了。美国共产党在它成立后的整个艰难的大风暴的时期里，遭到了最强大的帝国主义压迫者的残酷的迫害，并且对腐朽的资本主义所宣扬的种种骗人的幻想展开了斗争。因此，党对于它在工人反对战争、法西斯主义和有组织的反动派的斗争中的贡献，完全可以引以自豪……美国共产党经受住了帝国主义反动派的进攻，现在，当整个世界正在迅速地从资本主义基础上过渡到社会主义基础上的时候，它又将重新起它固有的作用……”
    美国共产党书记丹尼斯在发言中指出，现在的远东危机是美帝国主义侵略政策的结果。他说，艾森豪威尔政府奉行着挑衅性的好战方针。这个方针所造成的局势使广大群众、使许多美国人深感不安，他们无疑地抱着反战情绪。
    丹尼斯接着说，美国统治集团企图用在远东的疯狂挑衅来掩饰艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯主义的失败。但是，人民的坚决意志是能够防止战争的。他在指出苏联和中华人民共和国的和平倡议以后说，美国共产党将尽一切力量为和平而斗争。
    美国共产党全国委员会委员戴维斯强调指出美国共产党在争取黑人权利和争取使黑人平等的斗争中的作用。他严厉谴责艾森豪威尔政府没有采取措施来制止对黑人，特别是对黑人青年的越来越野蛮的污辱。他说，美国政府的国内外政策都是具有灾难性的。他主张，如果总统不在对内对外政策中结束使国家处于灾难边缘的做法的话，就把他交付参议院弹劾。
    在会上通过了一项决议，要求美国从台湾和中国其他沿海岛屿撤出，并且把自己的全部海军陆军撤离西太平洋地区。会议在另外两个决议中要求赦免政治犯，要求美国停止支持古巴的独裁者巴蒂斯塔。
    会议热烈欢迎苏联、中华人民共和国、法国、印度、日本、突尼斯、哥伦比亚、挪威、荷兰、加拿大、阿根廷等许多国家的兄弟共产党和工人党的贺电。这些贺电登载在“工人周报”上。
