Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch, New York: The 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly opened in New York at 3:15 PM New York time on the 16th.

The President of the previous session of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Munro (New Zealand), served as the provisional president of the General Assembly and presided over the opening of the Assembly. The meeting elected the president of this session. There were three candidates running for the presidency of this session: Mahgoub (Sudan), nominated by the vast majority of Arab countries, Nosek (Czechoslovakia), nominated by the delegations of Eastern European countries, and Malik (Lebanon), supported by the United States.

Before the vote, David, the head of the Czechoslovak delegation and Minister of Foreign Affairs, announced that the Czechoslovak delegation was withdrawing Nosek's candidacy in support of the Arab candidate Mahgoub. The result of the vote was that Malik was elected Chairman with 45 votes, relying on the United States and many countries under US control. Thirty-one votes were in favor of Mahgoub. Four delegations did not participate in the vote.

The Arab countries were firmly opposed to Malik as a candidate for the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. Malik is the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the traitorous Shamun-Solhah government of Lebanon, and he and this government are not only firmly opposed by the Lebanese people, but the new Lebanese President Shehab is about to take office. As Mahgoub pointed out on the eve of the opening of the General Assembly, after September 25 or 26, Malik will lose his position as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lebanon and representative of Lebanon to the United Nations.

After the president of the General Assembly was elected, the plenary session of the Assembly was adjourned. The meetings of the various working committees of the Assembly then opened and elected the chairmen of these committees. Miguel Uquia (El Salvador) was elected Chairman of the Political Committee. Mihai Magheru (Romania) was elected Chairman of the Special Political Committee, Toru Haguiwara (Japan) was elected Chairman of the Economic and Financial Committee, Lina Tsaldaris (Greece) was elected Chairman of the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee, Frederick Boland (Ireland) was elected Chairman of the Trusteeship Committee, Claude Coree (Ceylon) was elected Chairman of the Administrative and Budgetary Committee, and Jorge Castañeda (Mexico) was elected Chairman of the Legal Committee.

    联大一开幕就展开斗争
    美国硬把马利克推向主席坐位
    新华社17日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会第十三届会议16日纽约时间十五点十五分在纽约开幕。
    联合国大会上届会议主席孟罗（新西兰）担任大会临时主席并主持大会开幕。会议选举了本届会议主席。竞选这届会议主席的有三个候选人，他们是：绝大多数阿拉伯国家提出的马哈古卜（苏丹），东欧各国代表团提出的诺赛克（捷克斯洛伐克）和美国支持的马利克（黎巴嫩）。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长、外交部长戴维在投票前宣布，捷克斯洛伐克代表团撤销诺赛克的竞选，以支持阿拉伯国家候选人马哈古卜。投票结果，马利克靠了美国和在美国控制下的许多国家以四十五票当选为主席。投票赞成马哈古卜的三十一票。四个代表团没有参加投票。
    阿拉伯国家是坚决反对马利克作为本届大会主席候选人的。马利克是黎巴嫩夏蒙—索勒哈卖国政府的外交部长，他和这个政府不仅是黎巴嫩人民所坚决反对的，而且黎巴嫩新总统谢哈布即将就职，正如马哈古卜在大会开幕前夕所指出的，9月25日或26日以后，马利克就失去了黎巴嫩外交部长和黎巴嫩驻联合国的代表的身分了。
    选出大会主席后大会全体会议休会。大会各工作委员会会议接着开会，选举这些委员会的主席。米盖尔·乌基亚（萨尔瓦多）当选为政治委员会主席。米海·马格鲁（罗马尼亚）当选特别政治委员会主席，萩原彻（日本）当选经济及财政委员会主席，莉娜·察尔达里斯（希腊）当选社会、人道及文化委员会主席，茀雷德里克·博兰（爱尔兰）当选托管委员会主席，克劳德·科里五（锡兰）当选行政及预算委员会主席，豪尔赫·卡斯塔尼达（墨西哥）当选法律委员会主席。
