Short Commentary

    After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on deep plowing and soil improvement, various localities held meetings, established institutions, and adopted a series of measures, determined to plant winter wheat, rapeseed, and other overwintering crops in deeply plowed land. In Shaanxi, Shanxi, Gansu and other provinces with more summer fallow land and earlier start, most areas have completed or basically completed the deep plowing of summer fallow land. Henan and Hebei provinces, which have a larger deep plowing task for wheat fields, have a strong momentum and large scale, and quickly formed a climax. Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Beijing and other provinces and cities are also actively taking actions to strive for the upstream. The enthusiasm of cadres and the masses in various places is very strong. This is a good start for a greater harvest of summer crops next year, which is very exciting.
    However, there are still some problems that must be improved immediately.
    First, the movement has not been carried out evenly. Linyi Special District in Shandong Province has deeply plowed 1.94 million mu, accounting for 43% of the area harvested in autumn, while Changwei Special District has deeply plowed only 1.4% of the area harvested in autumn, a big difference. This situation exists everywhere. The season for planting wheat is very tight, and places that start too late will be in danger of not completing the task. Measures must be taken immediately to catch up.
    Second, it now appears that fertilization is a major issue. In some places, labor has not been well organized, and the delivery and spreading of manure cannot keep up with deep plowing, so many fields have been deeply plowed without applying base fertilizer. In Dongming County, Henan Province, more than 220,000 mu have been deeply plowed, but only more than 25,000 mu have been fertilized with base fertilizer, accounting for 11.6%. Even in Shangqiu Special District, which is doing better, there are still 30% of the fields that have been deeply plowed without applying base fertilizer. According to some typical surveys in Jiangsu Province, only 50% of the deep plowing is combined with the application of base fertilizer. Without sufficient base fertilizer, the effect of deep plowing cannot be fully realized. It is hoped that all localities will pay attention to this issue.
    Third, it is necessary to continue to vigorously grasp the reform of deep plowing agricultural tools. At present, the main methods used for deep plowing in various places are still front plow followed by draft animals, front plow followed by turning, and manual turning. This shows that the reform of deep plowing agricultural tools still needs to be vigorously grasped. Rope traction machines are effective tools for deep plowing. In order to solve the current difficulty of insufficient rural labor, Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the National Rope Traction Machine On-site Conference in Nanjing, called for striving to promote rope traction machines to all social teams across the country within a month to meet the current needs of autumn planting and deep plowing. This is a very important instruction.
    Fourth, labor should be arranged reasonably. At present, it is the season for autumn harvesting and planting, coupled with steel, fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy and other work, labor is very tight. Although deep plowing is the center, other tasks cannot be relaxed. Therefore, it is necessary to take care of all aspects and make unified arrangements for labor. Xuchang Special District in Henan Province arranged 35% of the labor force for deep plowing, 40% for fertilizer accumulation and autumn field management, and 25% for steel, and water conservancy. In solving the problem of labor shortage, we can also refer to the all-people mobilization in Hebei Province and the large-scale inter-regional cooperation carried out in many places. The specific proportions of labor arrangement vary from place to place, and from time to time in the same place, so they should be changed according to time and place, and the important thing is to have an arrangement.
    Finally, in terms of the quality of deep plowing, some places have not grasped the principle of "loose soil on top, not disturbing the soil layers" tightly enough. Some places only plowed to five or six inches. It is very good for all localities to conduct timely inspections of deep plowing and immediately rework those that do not meet the requirements. Qian County in Shaanxi Province reworked 200,000 mu. The Secretary of the Shangqiu Prefectural Committee of Henan Province led an inspection team to various places to inspect and accept, and all those that did not meet the specifications were reworked, which was also very effective and worth promoting.
    The movement has just begun, and it is not too late to take measures to solve these problems immediately, which will play a great role in striving for a greater harvest next summer.

    需要检查深耕工作
    中共中央发布关于深耕和改良土壤的指示以后，各地纷纷召开会议，建立机构，并采取一系列措施，决心要把冬麦、油菜等越冬作物都种在深耕地上。夏闲地较多、着手较早的陕西、山西、甘肃等省大部分地区，已经完成或基本上完成了夏闲地的深耕工作。麦地深耕任务较大的河南、河北两省，来势猛，规模大，很快就形成了高潮。江苏、安徽、山东、北京等省、市，也正在积极行动，力争上游。各地干部、群众的劲头都很足。这是明年夏季作物更大丰收的良好开端，十分令人兴奋。
    但是，目前也还存在一些必须立即改进的问题。
    首先，运动开展得还不平衡。山东省临沂专区已深耕一百九十四万亩，占已秋收面积的43％，而昌潍专区已深耕面积只占已秋收面积的1.4％，相差很大。这种情况各地都有。种麦的季节很紧迫，开展过迟的地方，就会有完不成任务的危险。要立即采取一些措施，赶上前去。
    其次，现在看来施肥是个大问题。有些地方劳动力没有组织好，送粪、铺粪跟不上深耕，因之有很多地深耕了还没有施底肥。河南省东明县深耕二十二万多亩，施底肥的只二万五千多亩，占11.6％。开展较好的商丘专区也还有30％的地深耕了没有施底肥。江苏省一些典型调查，深耕结合施底肥的只占50％。不施足底肥，就不能充分发挥深耕的效果。希望各地注意这个问题。
    第三，还要继续大抓深耕农具的改制工作。目前各地深耕采用的主要方法还是前犁后套、前犁后翻、人工翻三种。这说明深耕农具的改制工作还需要大抓一下。绳索牵引机是深耕的有效工具。为了解决当前农村劳力不足的困难，中共中央书记处书记谭震林同志在南京全国绳索牵引机现场会议上，号召力争在一个月的时间内，把绳索牵引机推广到全国所有的社队，以适应当前秋种深翻的需要，这是一项十分重要的指示。
    第四，要合理安排劳力。目前正是秋收秋种季节，加上钢铁、积肥、水利等工作，劳力十分紧张。深耕虽是中心，但不能放松另外的几项工作。因此必须照顾全面，统一安排一下劳力。河南许昌专区安排35％劳力搞深耕，40％劳力搞积肥和秋田管理，25％劳力搞钢铁、水利。在解决劳力不足方面，还可以参考河北省全民总动员，和很多地方开展的地区间大协作的方式。劳力安排的具体的比例数字，各地情况不一样，同一地方不同时期也不一样，要因时因地改变，要紧的是要有个安排。
    最后，在深耕的质量方面，有些地方对“活土在上，不乱土层”的原则掌握得还不够紧。有些地方只耕到五、六寸。各地对深耕要进行及时检查，对不合要求的立即返工的办法很好，陕西省乾县就返工二十万亩。河南省商丘地委书记带领检查组到各地检查、验收，不合规格的一律返工，效果也很好，值得推广。
    现在运动刚刚开始，立即采取措施解决这些问题，还不算晚，对争取明年夏季更大的丰收将起很大作用。
