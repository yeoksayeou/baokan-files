Education and Production Labor Combine to Bloom
    Beijing Aviation Institute Advances Towards the Red and Expert Path
    Teachers and Students Cooperatively Manufacture New Type of Aircraft

    Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: The modern light passenger plane "Beijing No. 1," designed and manufactured by the teachers and students of Beijing Aviation Institute as a gift to the Party for National Day, has today soared into the sky and successfully passed its test flight.

    The successful manufacturing of the aircraft by more than 1,400 teachers and students of Beijing Aviation Institute through arduous efforts is a victory for the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and a victory for the wisdom of the masses under the leadership of the Party.

    The test flight ceremony was held at the airport in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. The chief test pilot was the famous pilot Pan Guoding, who had broken through aerial restricted zones and conquered the "natural barrier" of Beijing-Lhasa. The co-pilot was Wang Laiquan, a pilot with many years of experience. Today, they piloted "Beijing No. 1" in its maiden voyage for twenty minutes in the sky above the airport, and dived to a low altitude of six to ten meters above the ground, passing in front of the cheering crowd. After the plane landed safely, the two experienced pilots excitedly told reporters that they were satisfied with the performance of "Beijing No. 1."

    "Beijing No. 1" is a single-wing, twin-propeller light passenger aircraft that can carry eight people, excluding the pilot. According to the design, its maximum range is 1,072 kilometers, its maximum speed is 300 kilometers per hour, and it can ascend to a maximum altitude of 4,800 meters. Because of its short take-off distance and slow landing speed, it can take off and land at small airports, making it particularly suitable for short-distance transportation between provinces and counties. It consumes little fuel, making it economical to operate. Equipped with modern flight instruments, navigation equipment, and blind landing, fire prevention, and anti-icing devices, it is capable of all-weather safe flight.

    Lin Feng, Director of the Second Office of the State Council, Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Education, General Liu Yalou, Commander of the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Yang Shu, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as Soviet experts and more than 3,000 students from many universities in Beijing and Beijing Aviation Institute, attended the test flight ceremony. Lin Feng cut the ribbon before the plane took off. Yang Xiufeng, on behalf of the Ministry of Education, congratulated the students of Beijing Aviation Institute and expressed the hope that they would continue to promote the spirit of unity and hard work and make greater achievements on the road of combining education with productive labor.

    Zang Boping, Second Secretary of the Party Committee of Beijing Aviation Institute, said at the test flight ceremony: Our institute has grown and strengthened with the help of Soviet experts. As we celebrate the birth of "Beijing No. 1," all the teachers and students of the institute sincerely thank the Soviet experts for their selfless assistance.

    The trial production of "Beijing No. 1" has not only not reduced, but has greatly improved the quality of education and scientific research. Through trial production, the institute has initially accumulated experience in designing and trial-producing aircraft, laying the foundation for future improvements in teaching and scientific research. The students have also taken a big step forward on the road of being both Red and expert. Among the fifth-year students who participated in this trial production, about 80% have now reached the level of fourth-grade technicians. The vast majority of students graduating this summer from the institute's aircraft technology major have reversed the past trend of looking down on factories and workers, and have chosen factories as their first choice for employment.

    教育与生产劳动结合的花朵
    北京航空学院向红专大道迈进
    师生合作制成新型飞机
    据新华社24日讯  北京航空学院师生为了国庆向党献礼而亲手设计和制造的现代化轻型旅客机“北京一号”，已经在今天矫健地飞上天空，胜利地接受了试飞的考验。
    北京航空学院一千四百多名师生经过苦战制成了飞机，是党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合方针的胜利，是在党的领导下群众智慧的胜利。
    试飞典礼是在北京东郊机场举行的。主任试飞员是曾经突破空中禁区、征服北京—拉萨“天险”的著名飞行员潘国定，副试飞员是有多年经验的飞行员王来泉。他们两人今天驾驶“北京一号”在机场上空做了二十分钟的处女航行，并俯冲到离地面六到十公尺的低空，从欢笑着的人群的前方掠过。当飞机安全着陆以后，这两位有经验的飞行员兴奋地对记者说，他们对“北京一号”的性能感到满意。
    “北京一号”是单翼双螺旋桨轻型旅客机，不算驾驶员可坐八个人。根据设计，它的最大航程是一千零七十二公里，最高时速每小时三百公里，最高可以上升到四千八百公尺，因为起飞距离短和降陆速度慢，它可以在小型机场起落，特别适用于省县之间的短途交通。它的耗油量小，使用起来很经济，由于设有现代化的飞行仪表、导航设备和盲目着陆、防火、防冰等装置，所以能够进行全天候的安全飞行。
    国务院第二办公室主任林枫，教育部部长杨秀峰，中国人民解放军空军司令员刘亚楼上将，中共北京市委宣传部部长杨述，以及苏联专家和北京许多高等院校、北京航空学院学生等共三千多人参加了试飞典礼。林枫在飞机起飞前剪了彩。杨秀峰代表教育部对北京航空学院学生表示祝贺，希望他们继续发扬团结苦干的精神，在教育结合生产劳动的道路上做出更大的成绩。
    中共北京航空学院党委第二书记臧伯平在试飞典礼上说：我们这个学院是在苏联专家帮助下成长壮大起来的，当我们欢庆“北京一号”诞生的时候，全院师生衷心地感谢苏联专家的无私援助。
    “北京一号”的试制，不仅没有降低而且大大提高了教育和科学研究工作的质量。经过试制，学院初步积累了设计和试制飞机的经验，为今后改进教学和科学研究工作打下了基础。同学们也在又红又专的道路上迈进了一大步。参加这次试制的五年级学生中，目前有80％左右的人已经达到了四级技工的水平。这个学院飞机工艺专业今年暑假毕业班的绝大部分学生一反往年轻视工厂和工人的常规，都选定工厂做为自己参加工作的第一志愿。
