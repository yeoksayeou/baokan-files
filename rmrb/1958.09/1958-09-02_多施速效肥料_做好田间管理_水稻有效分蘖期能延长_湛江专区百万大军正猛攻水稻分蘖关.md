Apply More Quick-Acting Fertilizer and Do a Good Job of Field Management
　　The Effective Tillering Period of Rice Can Be Extended
    The Million-Strong Army in Zhanjiang Prefecture is Fiercely Attacking the Rice Tillering Stage
    (Our report) The million-strong army in Zhanjiang Prefecture, Guangdong Province, is smashing the outdated agricultural concept of a "22-day effective tillering period." They continue to attack the tillering stage to ensure that the four million mu of late rice fields increase from the current 600,000 panicles per mu to one million panicles per mu. The two million mu of high-yield fields must reach two million panicles per mu, and high-yield experimental fields must reach five to six million panicles per mu or more.

    Most of the late rice in Zhanjiang Prefecture has been transplanted for fifteen to twenty days. According to the old agricultural rules, the effective tillering time is about to end. The influence of these outdated views still prevails. Many places stipulate that water should be drained and the fields sun-dried twenty-two days after transplanting to control ineffective tillering. If we really follow these old rules, it will cause incalculable losses. Because most of the late rice currently has only about 600,000 panicles per mu, even if calculated at 80 grains per panicle, it can only reach 2,400 jin, which cannot achieve the established late-season production increase targets of various counties.

    The Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that although time is tight for striving for more tillering, it is definitely not "too late." According to the experience of Hainan, Shantou, and this region, fifteen to twenty days after transplanting is the golden age of late rice tillering. Not only now, but also in the next ten days, effective tillering can still be promoted. The experimental field of the Xia Dong cooperative in Wenchang County, Hainan District, implemented drainage, shallow irrigation, and topdressing with quick-acting fertilizer between twenty-four and thirty-one days after transplanting, and can still tiller from seven original main panicles to twenty-six panicles. A rice field in Ma Dong, Xieji Township, Maoming County, transplanted in a two-by-five specification, was transplanted three days before "Great Heat." It has been thirty-seven days now, and the rice seedlings are still continuing to tiller in large quantities. Originally, six to seven plants were planted per cluster, but now it has tillered to fourteen to fifteen, about one-third of which tillered more than thirty days after transplanting. These tillered panicles after being transplanted for two or thirty days are all strong and leafy, with good growth potential. These facts prove that effective tillering is by no means limited to twenty-two days. The reason why ineffective tillering is formed is because they are born a few days late and are caught in the middle without sufficient air, sunlight, and nutrients. The Chaoshan area has created successful experience in cutting rice tails to promote effective tillering. Increasing air and sunlight by cutting rice tails, plus applying more quick-acting fertilizer, can make the tillered panicles catch up with the main panicles and grow strong.

    Zhanjiang is located in a subtropical region, and the temperature is higher than in Chaoshan, Foshan and other regions, which is more conducive to rice tillering. After the experimental field of Ganglie Cooperative in Yangjiang County applied manure once, it tillered from 400,000 panicles per mu to more than one million panicles. In many places, there have been examples of tillering doubling or even two or three times in a few days. Zhanjiang is now taking six measures to promote effective tillering of rice seedlings: topdressing, mid-cultivation, drainage and irrigation, cutting rice tails (for already closed high-yield fields), scraping morning mist (dew will weaken sunlight and cause the rice leaves to bend, affecting air circulation and nutrient absorption) and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, among which the decisive measure is topdressing. A large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign has been launched in various places.

    多施速效肥料　做好田间管理
　　水稻有效分蘖期能延长
    湛江专区百万大军正猛攻水稻分蘖关
    本报讯　广东省湛江专区百万田头大军大破旧农学“有效分蘖二十二天”的陈腐观点，继续攻打分蘖关，保证四百万亩晚稻田每亩由现在的六十万穗左右增加到一百万穗，二百万亩丰产田每亩要达到二百万穗，高产试验田每亩要达到五、六百万穗以上。
    湛江专区大部分晚稻插下已有十五到二十天。按旧农学的陈规，有效分蘖的时间就要完了，这些陈旧观点的影响至今还是普遍存在，不少地方规定插秧后二十二天即要排水晒田，控制无效分蘖。如果真的照这些陈规办事，就将造成不可估量的损失。因为大部分晚稻目前每亩只有六十万穗左右，即使按每穗八十粒计，也只能达到二千四百斤，这就不能实现各县既定的晚造增产指标。
    中共湛江地委认为，争取多分蘖，时间虽然紧迫，但绝对没有“过时”。根据海南、汕头和本区的经验，插后十五到二十天正是晚稻分蘖的黄金时代，不仅现在而且在今后十天仍然可以促进有效分蘖。海南区文昌县霞洞社的试验田，在插秧二十四天到三十一天之间实行排水、浅灌和追施速效肥，还可以从七条本穗分蘖到二十六条穗。茂名县谢鸡乡马垌一块插二乘五规格的稻田，是在“大署”前三天插下秧的，到现在已有三十七天，禾苗还在继续大量分蘖，原来每科插的是六至七条，现在已分蘖到十四到十五条，其中三分之一左右是在插下三十天以后分蘖的。这些插下二、三十天以后的分蘖穗都是枝壮叶强，生势很好。这些事实证明，有效分蘖决不限于二十二天。至于无效分蘖之所以形成，是因为它们生出来晚了几天，挟在中间得不到充足的空气、阳光和养分。潮汕地区已经创造了剪禾尾促进有效分蘖的成功经验。用剪禾尾的办法增加空气、阳光，再加上多施速效肥，就可以使分蘖穗跟上主穗一起圆身拔节。
    湛江地区处于亚热带，气温比潮汕、佛山等地区高，更有利于水稻的分蘖。阳江县岗列社的试验田追施一次粪水以后，每亩就由四十万穗分蘖到一百多万穗。许多地方都出现了几天内分蘖一倍以至两、三倍的事例。湛江专区各地现正采取六项措施来促进禾苗有效分蘖：追肥、中耕、排灌、剪禾尾（已封行的丰产田）、早晨刮雾水（露水会减弱日照，并使禾叶弯曲，影响空气流通和禾苗吸收养分）和防治病虫害，其中决定性的措施是追肥。各地已经掀起了大规模的积肥运动。
