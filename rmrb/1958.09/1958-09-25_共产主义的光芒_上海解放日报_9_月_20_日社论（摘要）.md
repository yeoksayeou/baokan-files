The workers of Jiangnan Shipyard, after vigorous airing of views and debates, voluntarily abolished the piece-rate wage system, which was no longer suited to the current great leap forward in production, bringing about a vigorous new atmosphere in production. This news is very educational and inspiring.

Recently, many factories in the city where piece-rate wages were previously implemented, workers have successively requested to reform the existing piece-rate wage system. Some actively reported the situation to the factory Party committee and made suggestions; others used the method of vigorous airing of views and debates to express their opinions on reforming piece-rate wages. Many workers believe that when the people of the whole country are working selflessly for the realization of socialism and communism, continuing to implement piece-rate wages, counting every piece and every penny, is no longer suitable for the current situation of the great leap forward. As some workers said: Our production is increasing by one, ten, or dozens of times, which is the result of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture nationwide. Can wages also increase by one, ten, or a hundred times? Some said: Now there is a great technical revolution everywhere. The promotion of an advanced experience can immediately increase production efficiency by many times. This is the result of collective labor. If piece-rate workers also receive bonus payments in proportion, it would be too unreasonable. Some even sharply pointed out: We work to build socialism, not for money. Do we want politics to take command, or do we want money to take command?

These demands of the worker masses fully reflect that after the great rectification movement, the communist consciousness of the broad masses has been unprecedentedly raised. They understand that our current labor is not for ourselves to earn three or five more yuan, but to accelerate socialist construction and build a glorious communist society on the land of the motherland more quickly, so that everyone can be happy. In order to achieve this great goal, they are not only unwilling to earn those few extra yuan, but also willing to dedicate everything to it, including all their energy and wisdom. Lenin said in "A Great Beginning": "When ordinary workers overcome immense difficulties, display initiative, redouble their efforts to increase labour productivity, to safeguard every pood of grain, coal, iron and other products, which are not for the benefit of themselves and their 'close' relatives, but for the benefit of their 'distant relatives', i.e., for the benefit of the whole of society... that is when communism begins." The workers of Jiangnan Shipyard and some other factories, disregarding personal gains and losses, voluntarily abolish and reform the piece-rate wage system and implement a more reasonable wage system for the development of production and the interests of the entire society. This kind of act of subordinating one's personal interests to the interests of the state and forgetting oneself for the sake of the public is a manifestation of communist style and is worthy of great promotion.

Facts have proved that because the piece-rate wage system is no longer compatible with the current great leap forward in production, when the leaders of the enterprises accepted the demands of the masses and reformed the system, the communist spirit and revolutionary drive of the broad masses were further developed, and productivity immediately experienced a new leap. A worker in the diesel engine factory once wrote a poem praising this reform: "Political consciousness is rising steadily, time-based pay is better than piece-rate pay, output is high and quality is good, the red flag will always fly in the wind."

From this, it can be seen that reforming piece-rate wages is a conscious demand of the broad masses of workers and an inevitable trend to adapt to the situation of the great leap forward. Therefore, when the worker masses rise up to voluntarily demand the reform of the piece-rate wage system, the leaders of the enterprises should follow the "trend" of the masses, actively lead them, closely rely on the masses, and gradually seek a good solution through airing of views and debates to satisfy the reasonable wishes of the masses.

In the past, in wage work, some places have had the phenomenon of one-sidedly emphasizing material incentives and neglecting political work. Through the work of reforming piece-rate wages, communist ideological education should be consciously carried out among the masses so that the broad masses can treat the wage issue with the spirit of communism, so that communist ideology can shine even more brightly and better promote the current great leap forward in production.

    共产主义的光芒
    ——上海解放日报9月20日社论（摘要）
    江南造船厂的工人，经过大鸣大放，自动取消了与当前生产大跃进已经不相适应的计件工资制度，使生产进一步出现了蓬勃的新气象。这一消息给人以很大的教育和启发。
    最近以来，本市许多工厂过去实行计件工资的工人，纷纷提出要求改革现有的计件工资制度。有的向厂党委积极反映情况，提出建议；有的用大鸣大放的办法表示要改革计件工资的意见。许多工人都认为：当全国人民都在为实现社会主义、共产主义而忘我劳动的时候，再继续实行计件工资，件件要钱、算钱，已经不能适应当前大跃进的形势了。如有的工人说：我们的生产在一倍、十倍、几十倍地增加，这是全国工农业大跃进的结果，难道工资也能一倍、十倍、百倍地增加吗？有的说：现在到处大闹技术革命，一件先进经验的推广，可以使生产效率立刻提高好多倍，这是集体劳动的成果，如果计件工人也按比例拿超额奖金，那就太不合理了。有的甚至尖锐地提出：我们劳动是为了建设社会主义，不是为了钞票。我们究竟是要让政治挂帅，还是叫钞票挂帅？
    工人群众的这些要求，充分反映了经过伟大的整风运动，广大群众的共产主义觉悟空前提高了。他们懂得：我们现在劳动，并不是为了自己多拿三块五块钱，而是为了加速社会主义建设，在祖国的土地上，更快地建立起一个光辉灿烂的共产主义社会，使人人得到幸福。为了实现这个伟大的目标，他们不仅不愿多拿那几块钱，而且愿意为此献出一切，包括自己的全部精力和智慧。列宁在“伟大的创举”一文中说：“当一般普通工人起来克服极大困难，奋不顾身地设法增加劳动生产率，设法保护每一普特粮食、煤、铁及其他产品，这些产品不是归劳动者本人及其‘近亲’所有，而是归他们的‘远亲’，即归全社会所有……，——这也就是共产主义开始了的时候。”江南造船厂及有些工厂的工人，不计个人得失，为了生产的发展和整个社会的利益，自愿取消和改革计件工资制度，实行更合理的工资制度，这种把自己的个人利益服从国家利益，因公忘私的作为，正是共产主义风格的一种表现，是值得大大提倡的。
    事实证明，由于计件工资制度和当前的生产大跃进已经不相适应，因此当企业的领导一接受了群众的要求，对这项制度加以改革以后，广大群众的共产主义精神和革命干劲，便进一步发扬起来了，生产力也随即出现一个新的飞跃。柴油机厂一位工人曾写了一首诗，歌颂这项改革：“政治觉悟节节高，计时要比计件好，产量高来质量好，红旗永远迎风飘”。
    由此可见，改革计件工资，这是广大工人群众的自觉要求，也是适应大跃进形势的必然趋势。因此在工人群众起来自动要求改革计件工资制度的时候，企业的领导应该顺着群众的“水势”，积极加以领导，紧紧依靠群众，通过鸣放辩论，逐步地求得很好的处理，满足群众这种合理的愿望。
    过去在工资工作中，有些地方曾经存在过片面强调物质鼓励、忽视政治工作的现象。通过改革计件工资的工作，应该有意识地在群众中进行一次共产主义的思想教育，使广大群众都能以共产主义的精神来对待工资问题，让共产主义思想更加大放光芒，更好促进当前生产的大跃进。
