Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: New York dispatch: While the United States is touting conspiracies to implement a "ceasefire" in the coastal islands area of China, it is simultaneously intensifying military threats and war deployments in the Taiwan Strait area.

On the day that the Sino-American ambassadorial talks were held on the 15th, the "New York Herald Tribune," which often reflects the opinions of the U.S. State Department, clamored in an editorial that China "should stop shelling" the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous troops entrenched on the coastal islands. This newspaper shamelessly stated that "if the Communist Chinese want to show sincerity, then stopping this unwarranted offensive would seem to be the first step." The editorial proposed that the condition for the Taiwan area to "possibly return to a more peaceful situation" is that China does not insist on "the original attitude that Communist China must be free to deal with the Kuomintang." This American clamor nakedly exposes their attempt to interfere, through negotiations, with the sacred right of the Chinese people to punish the Chiang Kai-shek traitors and liberate their own territory.

According to a report published on the 15th by the Tokyo "Yomiuri Shimbun's" London correspondent, quoting "reliable sources in London," "intelligence from Washington reveals" that the United States will demand that China stop shelling the coastal islands "as a prerequisite for negotiations." The U.S. "San Francisco Examiner" also revealed the same message on the 15th, saying that the United States will "demand that the Chinese Communists stop shelling these coastal islands."

At the same time, news indicates that the United States intends to use the "ceasefire" to "reinforce" the Kinmen (Quemoy) Chiang bandit troops, who are being tightly besieged by the People's Liberation Army's artillery fire, in order to further conduct military provocations and harassments against China from these Chinese inland sea islands. United Press International, Washington, September 16th, reported that Washington officials admitted that Kinmen is "suffering from a Communist artillery blockade," and the United States wants to "try to negotiate an immediate ceasefire" to "break this noose." The British "Daily Express" correspondent reported from Washington on the 14th that "Defense Department sources are privately saying that the United States must break the Communist blockade of Kinmen," and that the United States will try its best to seek a "solution" through negotiations. U.S. Department of Defense officials told this British reporter, "Reports on the defense of Kinmen and Matsu have caused them great concern. ... American military advisors are frantically reporting that the morale of the (there) garrison is declining as rapidly as their ammunition is running out."

Under the smokescreen of discussing "ceasefire" conspiracies, the United States has been continuing to send reinforcements of various armed services to the Taiwan area these days, intensifying the expansion of the scope of armed aggression, and frantically preparing for war. The "New York Herald Tribune" Washington correspondent Margaret Higgins acknowledged in her report that this measure by the United States is to prepare for "taking new military actions." This reporter's report openly threatened that "if diplomats in Warsaw cannot secure a ceasefire within an appropriate timeframe," the United States will "take new military actions." The British "Daily Express" reporter reported from Taipei on the 15th that the work of strengthening the U.S. military force "has aroused speculation that the Americans may participate in Chiang Kai-shek's war against mainland China to a greater extent."

### 制造阻挠我国解放自己领土的新阴谋  美国不停止放火却叫嚷“停火”

    制造阻挠我国解放自己领土的新阴谋
    美国不停止放火却叫嚷“停火”
    新华社17日讯　纽约消息：美国一方面在鼓吹在中国沿海岛屿地区实行“停火”的阴谋，一方面正加紧在台湾海峡地区进行军事威胁和战争部署。
    在中美两国大使级会谈15日举行的一天，经常反映美国国务院意见的“纽约先驱论坛报”在一篇社论里，叫嚷中国“应该停止炮轰”盘据在沿海岛屿的蒋介石卖国贼部队。这家报纸无耻地说什么，“如果共产党中国人想要表现出诚意，那么停止这种无端的进攻看来将是第一个步骤”。社论里提出台湾地区“还可能恢复到较和平的情况”的条件是，中国不坚持“原有的必须让共产党中国可以自由地对付国民党人的态度”。美国这种叫嚷露骨地暴露出，他们企图通过谈判来干涉中国人民惩罚蒋介石卖国贼和解放自己领土的神圣权利。
    据日本“读卖新闻”15日发表的驻伦敦记者的报道里，引用“伦敦可靠人士”的话说，“来自华盛顿的情报透露”，美国将要求中国停止炮轰沿海岛屿“作为进行谈判的前提”。美国“旧金山考察者报”15日也透露出同样的消息，说美国将“要求中国共产党人停止炮击这些沿海岛屿”。
    同时，消息表明，美国是想利用“停火”来对正被中国人民解放军炮火死死围困住的金门蒋贼部队“增援”，以从这些中国内海岛屿进一步对中国进行军事挑衅和骚扰。合众国际社华盛顿16日消息说，华盛顿人士承认金门“遭受着共产党炮火的封锁”，美国要“设法谈判立即停火”，来“冲破这根索套”。英国“每日快报”驻华盛顿记者14日报道，美国“国防部人士私下说，美国必须粉碎共产党对金门的封锁”，美国要竭力通过谈判求得“解决办法”。美国国防部人士对这个英国记者说，“关于金门和马祖防务的报告使他们非常忧虑。……美国军事顾问们恐慌地报告说，（那里）守军的士气正像他们即将耗尽的弹药一样在日益低落。”
    在谈论“停火”阴谋的烟幕中，美国这几天正继续把各个兵种的增援部队开到台湾地区，加紧扩大武装侵略的范围，疯狂地在准备着战争。“纽约先驱论坛报”驻华盛顿记者玛格丽特·希金斯的报道里承认，美国这种措施是为了作好“采取新的军事行动”的准备。这个记者的报道里公然威胁说，“如果在华沙的外交官不能争取在适当的期限内停火”，美国就要“采取新的军事行动”。英国“每日快报”记者15日从台北报道，美国加强军事力量的工作，“引起了一种推测，认为美国人可能将在更大程度上参加蒋介石对中国大陆的战争”。
