　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th - One million coal mine workers across the country are now engaging in a movement to increase the production of coking coal with a fighting spirit and in a tense manner. They have put forward a resounding slogan: guarantee the overfulfillment of this year's coal production Great Leap Forward plan half a month ahead of schedule, and fight to stockpile grain and fodder for the Iron Marshal.

　　This year, China's coal production has greatly increased, with the output in the first eight months being equivalent to 90% of the total output of last year. After the launch of the high-yield month movement in September, coal production in the first half of the month has risen sharply. However, because the iron and steel industry is increasing production even faster, especially with the recent commissioning of a large number of small blast furnaces, coal production still cannot meet the needs, and the phenomenon of coking coal being in short supply has already begun to appear in many places. It is estimated that in the next few months, more small and indigenous blast furnaces will be put into production in various places. If revolutionary measures are not taken to rapidly increase coal production and deliver coal to the places that need it in a timely manner, the increase in iron and steel production will be affected.

　　To this end, the Ministry of Coal Industry convened a telephone conference on September 20, calling on all mines to make increasing the production of coking coal needed by the iron and steel industry the top priority at present. On the basis of the high-yield month movement that has already begun, a mass movement to increase the production of coking coal should be launched immediately. Strive to have everyone present gifts, every working face increase production, and every mine release large areas of high-yield "satellites" around the National Day.

　　In order to achieve this goal, the Ministry of Coal Industry also instructed all mines to quickly promote the many high-yield experiences that have already emerged. At the same time, it is necessary to further carry out the technical innovation movement, mobilize workers to offer suggestions, and concentrate the wisdom of the masses to overcome the current weak links in production. In the increase production movement, the provincial coal mine administrations must also strengthen their leadership over coking coal mines and transfer forces to fully support the production of coking coal mines.

　　In addition to ensuring the coal supply for key iron and steel enterprises, the Ministry of Coal Industry requires all provinces to seriously solve the problem of coking coal supply for small and indigenous blast furnaces scattered throughout the country. The main experience in this regard is to actively develop small coal kilns and use the method of blooming everywhere to meet the needs of the numerous small and indigenous blast furnaces. In this way, the problem of coal shortage can be solved, and the pressure on transportation can be reduced.

　　Now, a combat command center for commanding and dispatching the national coking coal production and transportation has been established in the Ministry of Coal Industry. Its task is to check the production and transportation situation in various places every day and solve various problems in the movement to increase the production of coking coal in a timely manner. The coking coal needed by the eighteen key iron and steel industrial units and the southern provinces lacking coal has all been included in the supply plan of each mine, and it is stipulated that priority must be given to advance shipment.

　　The Ministry of Coal Industry, the Coal Industry Institute, and the Beijing Mining Institute have also organized a "Coal Production Medical Team" of more than 600 people, who have successively set off to various mines to help solve production technical problems.

### 为钢铁元帅囤粮积草  百万煤矿职工投入增产焦煤运动

    为钢铁元帅囤粮积草
    百万煤矿职工投入增产焦煤运动
    新华社20日讯　全国一百万煤矿职工正在以战斗的姿态，紧张地投入增产炼焦煤的运动。他们提出了响亮的口号：保证提前半个月完成今年煤炭生产大跃进计划，为钢铁元帅囤粮聚草而斗争。
    今年我国煤炭生产有了很大增长，前八个月的产量就相当于去年全年产量的90％；9月份开展高产月运动后，上半月的煤炭产量更是直线上升。但是，由于钢铁工业增产得更快，特别是最近大批小高炉投入生产，煤炭生产仍不能满足需要，很多地方已开始出现炼焦煤供不应求的现象。估计今后几个月内，各地还有更多的小高炉土高炉投入生产，如果不采取革命措施，迅速增产煤炭，并把煤炭及时送到需要的地方去，将会影响到钢铁的增产。
    为此，煤炭工业部在9月20日召开电话会议，号召各矿必须把增产钢铁工业所需炼焦煤列为当前的首要任务。在已经开始的高产月运动的基础上，立即开展群众性的增产炼焦煤运动。争取在国庆节前后，做到人人献礼，掌掌（采煤工作面）增产，矿矿都能放出大面积高产的“卫星”。
    为了达到这一目的，煤炭工业部还指示各矿迅速推广目前已经出现的许多高产经验，同时要进一步开展技术革新运动，发动职工人人献计，集中群众智慧来克服当前生产中的薄弱环节。在增产运动中，各省煤矿管理局还必须加强对炼焦煤矿的领导，抽调力量全力支援炼焦煤矿的生产。
    除了保证重点钢铁企业的用煤以外，煤炭工业部要求各省对于分散在各地的小高炉和土高炉的炼焦煤供应问题也必须认真解决。这方面的主要经验是积极发展小煤窑，用遍地开花的办法来满足星罗棋布的小高炉和土高炉生产的需要。这样，既可以解决缺煤问题，又可以减轻运输的压力。
    现在，一个指挥和调度全国炼焦煤生产和运输的战斗指挥部已在煤炭工业部成立。它的任务是天天检查各地的生产和运输情况，及时解决增产炼焦煤运动中的各项问题。全国十八个钢铁工业重点单位和南方缺煤各省需要的炼焦煤，已全部纳入各矿的供应计划，并规定必须优先提前发运。
    煤炭工业部、煤炭工业学院和北京矿业学院还组织了一支六百多人的“煤炭生产医疗队”，他们已陆续出发到各矿去帮助解决生产技术问题。
