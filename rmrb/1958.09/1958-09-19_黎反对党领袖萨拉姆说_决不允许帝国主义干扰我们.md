	He also said that some of Chamoun's followers are trying to create a "bloody farewell" for their leader, but we are vigilant and attentive to this attempt.
	He said, "Chamoun's followers want to persuade us not to appoint those who took up arms against the traitor Chamoun as prime minister, but I want to tell the Lebanese people and all the Arab people that we are determined to have the person who led the people's uprising as our new prime minister."
	"Voice of Free Lebanon" radio also broadcast this morning that Lebanese Speaker of Parliament Oseiran received many members of parliament on the 16th and discussed with them the issue of organizing a new cabinet.

    黎反对党领袖萨拉姆说
    决不允许帝国主义干扰我们
    新华社大马士革17日电　据“自由黎巴嫩之声”电台今晨广播，黎巴嫩反对党领袖萨拉姆16日在记者招待会上说，“我们拿起了武器抗击帝国主义和它的代理人，我们决不允许这些恶势力再干扰我们的生活，因为我们要使黎巴嫩成为既没有帝国主义分子和他们的代理人存在的余地，也没有他们的通路的真正的阿拉伯国家”。
    他还说，夏蒙的一些追随者正在企图为他们的头子制造一个“流血的告别”，但是我们对这种企图保持着警惕和注意。
    他说，“夏蒙的追随者们想诱劝我们不任命拿武器打过卖国贼夏蒙的人担任总理，但是我要告诉黎巴嫩人民和全体阿拉伯人民，我们决心要领导了人民起义的人当我们的新总理。”
    “自由黎巴嫩之声”电台今晨还广播说，黎巴嫩议长奥塞兰在16日接见了许多位议员，同他们一起讨论了有关组织新内阁的问题。
