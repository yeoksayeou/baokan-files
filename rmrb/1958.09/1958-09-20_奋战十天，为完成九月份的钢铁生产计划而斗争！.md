    Fight for Ten Days, Struggle to Complete the September Steel Production Plan!
    From September 1st to September 17th, the cumulative national steel production was still far from meeting the requirements of the monthly plan. Today is September 20th, and including today, only the last eleven days remain to complete the September steel production plan. To complete the September production plan, we must produce an average of 60,000 tons of steel and 100,000 tons of iron per day in these eleven days. This is a very arduous task.
    Judging from the general trend of steel production from September 1st to 17th, it has been basically increasing day by day. In terms of steelmaking, although the output of some enterprises has declined, affecting the national daily steel output from rapidly increasing, an analysis of the reasons reveals various different situations. One is the shutdown of furnaces for major overhaul projects to expand production capacity; one is the tight supply of pig iron; and one is poor operation and poor furnace maintenance. As long as we work hard and skillfully, speed up the progress of major overhaul projects, improve operating techniques, and deliver pig iron in a timely manner, the daily steel output is likely to increase rapidly. In recent days, some rebuilt open-hearth furnaces and newly built converters have been put into production, so steelmaking production should have a big leap. In terms of pig iron, Henan, Hunan, Guizhou, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Shandong have all produced more than 1,000 tons per day (excluding the output of key enterprises). On the 17th, Jiangsu Province also entered the ranks of "thousand-ton provinces." Judging from the deployments of various provinces, many places are sharpening their swords and fighting hard day and night. It is very likely that a high tide of pig iron production will appear in late September, and a batch of "ten-thousand-ton provinces" and "thousand-ton counties" will likely emerge. Many things are often like this: they seem impossible, but as long as you are determined and determined not to give up until you achieve your goal, the situation will change rapidly.
    The current issue is still to seize the time and strive for a big leap in steel production in late September, rising day by day, to ensure the completion of the September steel production plan. In steel production, the eighteen key enterprises bear the vast majority of the task. In these ten days, they must go all out and do everything possible to win a great victory, so that the daily output rises sharply. However, to ensure a straight upward line in steel production, the material basis is still pig iron.
    The basic situation of pig iron production at present is: the creators of high-yield records and large-scale harvests have already moved far ahead, while general areas and general furnaces are still far behind. Looking at the situation in the provinces, seven provinces have a daily output of more than 1,000 tons, among which Henan Province reached an astonishing record of more than 18,000 tons on the 15th, and has continued to maintain a high level of more than 8,000 tons per day in recent days, and will soon rise rapidly, with a daily output possibly exceeding 20,000 tons. The daily output of other provinces and autonomous regions is still below 1,000 tons. Looking at the situation in the counties, eight counties in Henan, such as Yuxian, Lushan, and Baofeng, have reached a record of more than 1,000 tons per day; while the vast majority of counties across the country are far behind. Looking at the furnaces, advanced indigenous blast furnaces and small blast furnaces produce several tons or even more than ten tons of iron per day; while many indigenous blast furnaces and small blast furnaces across the country have not yet been able to produce iron normally, and a large part have not been put into production. This situation is of course difficult to avoid in the process of great development. The level of pig iron production in many places is lagging behind, which is inseparable from the fact that the plans were made later, the start was later, and other objective reasons. Moreover, newly built furnaces always need a period of time to explore and master the technology. However, if the advanced level is always only the level of a few places and cannot expand the results and popularize them across the country, then the national pig iron production plan cannot be completed. Therefore, the advanced should of course continue to move forward, but the most important thing at present is to improve the level of the backward to the advanced level as soon as possible and strive for a large-scale harvest of pig iron. We should strive to achieve this goal: among the more than 300,000 indigenous blast furnaces and small blast furnaces that have been built across the country, we should strive to have more than 65% put into production quickly in October, and more than 65% of them should be able to produce normally. We should also strive to achieve this goal: in October, there should be 30 or 50 counties across the country producing 1,000 tons of pig iron per day. Only by achieving this goal and striving for a large-scale harvest of pig iron can we complete the pig iron production plan and provide sufficient pig iron for increasing steel production.
    In order to achieve a large-scale harvest of indigenous blast furnaces, party committees at all levels need to consider the issue in a relatively broad scope. What issues need special attention at present? The first is mining. We should concentrate our efforts on reliable mining sites, including iron ore and coal mines. Now is no longer the time to concentrate our efforts on building a few "experimental furnaces" to make a show. If you only build a few "experimental furnaces," the problems of ore and coking coal are easy to solve. Now it is a matter of striving for a large-scale harvest, so that hundreds of thousands of indigenous blast furnaces all produce iron, and ensuring the supply of ore and coking coal becomes an extremely prominent issue. Without the necessary reserves of ore and coal, the indigenous blast furnaces will be cut off from "food and grass," and a large-scale harvest will be just empty talk. The second is transportation, continuously transporting ore and coking coal (or anthracite coal) to the front of the furnace to ensure that production is not delayed. Having ore and coal but not transporting them to the blast furnace does not solve the problem. At present, the transportation situation in various places is very tight, and the ore and coking coal needed by hundreds of thousands of indigenous blast furnaces is an extremely considerable figure. Failure to seize the transportation issue will make a large-scale harvest impossible. The third is smelting, which is the smelting technology issue. Some places have not yet solved this problem, that is to say, they have not yet learned indigenous ironmaking, which requires concentrating efforts to learn, figuring out the laws of developing indigenous ironmaking in the local area, and then promoting it universally. Some provinces have already solved it, but the so-called "solved" only means that a batch of good furnaces that can produce iron normally and in large quantities have emerged. This requires holding on-site meetings in a timely manner, promoting the experience of these model blast furnaces, and strengthening regular technical guidance and technical training, so as to achieve "one furnace igniting a myriad of furnaces." When solving the smelting technology issue, we must also solve the technical issue of using anthracite coal (smokeless coal) for ironmaking. Only learning coking coal ironmaking does not solve the problem for places that do not produce coking coal. Places that do not produce coking coal should learn to use anthracite coal for ironmaking to ensure normal production and a large-scale harvest. Now the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has organized tens of thousands of technical troops to go down, and various places should seize the time and quickly break through the technical barrier of indigenous blast furnaces. In addition to the above, we must continue to seize the construction of furnaces and prepare small blast furnaces and indigenous blast furnaces for the winter, and use indigenous methods to convert cold air into hot air.
    Solving the problems of mining, transportation, and smelting on a large scale is a very arduous task. But to complete the pig iron production plan, we must strive for a large-scale harvest, which is the key, and there is no other way.
    Comrades on the steel front! The whole party and the whole people are supporting you, the eyes of the people of the whole country are on you, waiting for you to create new records of large-scale production in the last ten days of September, create one "thousand-ton county" and "ten-thousand-ton province" after another, and present them as gifts for this year's National Day. We wish you complete success!

### 奋战十天，为完成九月份的钢铁生产计划而斗争！

    奋战十天，为完成九月份的钢铁生产计划而斗争！
    从9月1日到9月17日为止，全国钢铁生产的累计产量，距月计划的要求还很远。今天是9月20日，把今天算在里面，完成9月份的钢铁生产计划只剩下最后十一天的时间了。要完成9月份生产计划，必须在这十一天里，平均每天产钢六万吨，产生铁十万吨。这是一个十分艰巨的任务。
    从9月1日至17日钢铁生产总的趋势来看，基本上是逐日上升的。在炼钢方面，固然也有一些企业产量下降，影响到全国钢的日产量不能迅速提高，但分析原因也有种种不同的情况。一种是停炉进行扩大生产能力的大修工程；一种是生铁供应紧张；一种是操作不善、炉子维护不好。只要苦干、巧干，加快大修工程的进度，改善操作技术，及时运到生铁，钢的日产量是可能迅速增长的。最近几天就有一些大修的平炉和新建的转炉投入生产，因而炼钢生产应当有一个大跳跃。在生铁方面，河南、湖南、贵州、山西、四川、山东都已日产千吨以上（不包括重点企业的产量）。17日，江苏省也进入千吨省的行列。从各个省的部署来看，许多地方厉兵秣马，昼夜苦战，9月下旬很可能出现生铁生产大跃进的高潮，很可能出现一批万吨省、千吨县。有许多事情常常是这样，看起来似乎是办不到，然而只要下定决心，不达目的誓不罢休，情况就会迅速发生变化的。
    现在的问题还是抓紧时间，力争在9月下旬钢铁生产有一个大的跳跃，日日上升，确保9月份钢铁生产计划的完成。在钢的生产上，十八个重点企业担负着绝大部分任务，在这十天中必须全力以赴，想尽一切办法打一个大胜仗，使日产量猛烈上升。然而要保证钢产量直线上涨，物质基础仍然在于生铁。
    目前生铁生产的基本情况是：高产纪录和大面积丰收的创造者已经远远地走在前面，而一般的地区、一般的炉子还远远地落在后面。就省的情况来看，有七个省的日产量都在千吨以上，其中河南省的日产量在15日达到一万八千多吨的惊人纪录之后，连日来仍保持在日产八千吨以上的高水平，而且很快还会迅速上升，日产可能超过两万吨。而其他省和自治区的日产量都还在千吨以下。就县的情况来看，河南的禹县、鲁山、宝丰等八个县都已达到日产千吨以上的纪录；而全国绝大部分县还远远落在后面。就炉子来看，先进的土高炉、小高炉日产好几吨、甚至十几吨铁；而全国还有很多土高炉和小高炉至今未能正常出铁，还有很大一部分没有投入生产。这种情况固然是在大发展过程中难于避免的。许多地方生铁生产的水平落在后面，是同计划订得较晚、动手较迟以及其他客观原因分不开的。而且新建的炉子总是需要有一个时间在技术上来摸索掌握的。然而，如果让先进的水平永远只是少数地方的水平，而不能扩大战果，普及全国，那么，全国的生铁生产计划不可能完成。因此，先进的固然应当继续前进，但当前最关紧要的事情，毕竟还是尽快地把后进的水平提高到先进的水平，力争生铁大面积丰收。应该争取实现这样的目标，在全国已建成三十几万个土高炉、小高炉中，在10月份内应争取有65％以上能够迅速投入生产，其中又应有65％以上的能够正常生产。还应该争取实现这样的目标：在10月份全国有三十个或者五十个日产千吨生铁的县。只有实现这样的目标，力争生铁大面积丰收，才能完成生铁生产计划，为钢产加番提供充足的生铁。
    为了实现土高炉的大面积丰收，各级党委就需要在比较广阔的范围内考虑问题，目前有哪些问题需要特别注意呢？第一是挖，应该集中力量到可靠的矿点去采矿，包括采铁矿和煤矿。现在已经不只是集中力量搞几座“试验炉”，做出样子来的时候了。只搞几座“试验炉”，矿石和焦煤的问题都好解决。现在是争大面积丰收，要几十万座土高炉统统出铁，保证矿石和焦煤的供应就成为极其突出的问题。矿石、煤炭没有必要的储备，土高炉断了“粮草”，大面积丰收只是一句空话。第二是运，源源不绝地把矿石和焦煤（或者白煤）运到炉前，保证不耽误生产。有了矿石和煤炭，但运不到高炉跟前去，还是不解决问题。目前各地运输情况都很紧张，几十万座土高炉需要的矿石和焦煤更是一个极其可观的数字。不把运输问题抓紧，大面积丰收也不可能。第三是炼，是冶炼技术问题。这个问题，有些地方还没有解决，也就是说还没有学会土法炼铁，这就需要集中力量学会，摸出在本地区发展土法炼铁的规律，再普遍推广。有些省已经解决了，但所谓已经解决了，也只是指已经出现了一批能够正常出铁、大量出铁的好炉子。这就需要及时召开现场会议，推广这些模范高炉的经验，再加强经常的技术指导工作和技术训练工作，做到“一炉升火万炉红”。在解决冶炼技术问题的时候，同时要解决白煤（无烟煤）炼铁的技术问题。只学会焦煤炼铁，对于不产焦煤的地方来说，并没有解决问题。不产焦煤的地方，应该学会用白煤炼铁，才能保证正常生产，保证大面积丰收。现在中央冶金部已经组织了几万人的技术大军下去了，各地应抓紧时间，迅速突破土高炉的技术关。除了上述的以外，还要继续抓紧建炉和作好小高炉、土高炉过冬的准备，用土办法改冷风为热风。
    在大面积内解决挖、运、炼的问题，是一个十分艰巨的任务。但是要完成生铁生产计划，必须争得大面积丰收，这是关键所系，非此不可。
    钢铁战线的同志们！全党全民都在支援你们，全国人民的眼睛都望着你们，等待着你们在9月的最后十天内创造大面积丰产的新纪录，创造出一个又一个千吨县、万吨省，给今年的国庆节献礼。祝你们克尽全功！
