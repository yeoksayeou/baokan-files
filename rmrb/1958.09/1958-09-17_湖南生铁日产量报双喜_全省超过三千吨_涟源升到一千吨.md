This newspaper's Changsha dispatch of the 16th: In early September, Hunan Province's pig iron production increased by leaps and bounds. The province's daily pig iron output on September 1st was 1,034 tons, and by the 10th, it had jumped to 3,273 tons, exceeding the provincial Party committee's target of 3,000 tons of pig iron per day by September 10th. This is an unprecedented new record in Hunan Province's pig iron production.

The reason why Hunan Province's pig iron production was able to grow so rapidly in just ten days is mainly because the entire Party and all the people worked together, treating steel production as a major political task to be completed. More than 30,000 cadres, led by the first secretaries of Party committees at all levels, went to the forefront of steel production during this ten-day period. The labor army participating in pig iron production in the province also surged from 1.1 million at the end of August to the current 2 million. Because the first secretaries of the Party committees personally took charge and the vast number of cadres went to the front lines, many contradictions and key issues in production began to be resolved smoothly. Many areas opened small coal mines on a large scale, vigorously promoted indigenous methods of coking, and vigorously promoted the use of white coal for iron smelting, which initially solved the difficulty of fuel not keeping up. All localities mobilized the masses and made full use of all transportation tools such as ox carts, earthen carts, and aerial ropeways. The vehicles and ships of the transportation departments first met the needs of steel production, which eased the once-tense transportation situation. Counties such as Ningxiang adopted short-term training, roving inspections, absorbed people with iron-smelting skills from society, and held on-site meetings to quickly train a group of technical personnel.

In order to consolidate the achievements of the first ten days and strive to produce more pig iron in the middle and last ten days, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference on the evening of the 11th with the participation of the first secretaries of local and municipal party committees. The Provincial Party Committee encouraged all localities to summarize their experiences, advance victoriously, and strive to create greater achievements in the middle and last ten days. The Provincial Party Committee put forward the target of producing 5,000 tons of pig iron per day in the province in the middle ten days and 10,000 tons of pig iron per day in the last ten days, and asked all localities to strive to overfulfill the targets.

This newspaper reports: According to the New Hunan Daily, Lianyuan County produced 1,004.4 tons of pig iron on September 10th, setting a new record in the history of indigenous furnace iron smelting in Hunan Province.

As early as the end of August, the Lianyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the major political task of breaking through the 1,000-ton daily production mark before September 10th to the entire Party and all the people. In order to ensure the breakthrough of this major mark, all first secretaries from the county party committee to the township party committees took charge and directed the battle on the spot. The county also transferred more than 2,900 cadres to invest in steel production. In order to ensure that the furnaces produced iron normally and produced good iron, they also adopted active measures of six fixings and six togethers with the furnace. The six fixings are: fixed cadres, fixed technology, fixed labor, fixed raw materials, fixed output, and fixed time; the six togethers with the furnace are: production to the furnace, guidance to the furnace, experiment to the furnace, meetings to the furnace, eating to the furnace, and sleeping to the furnace. After solving the leadership and labor issues, the biggest issue was fuel. The county launched a communist grand collaboration. The county party committee drew labor from various townships and organized a 21,000-person shock transport team to rush out 6,800 tons of coke from the Mafang Coal Mine, providing timely and powerful support to large iron factories such as Anping and Renhe. In terms of breaking through technical barriers, the Huishui, Daqiao, and Qixing Iron Factories adopted a method of combining leaders, technicians, and apprentices, and put forward the slogan of "masters teach sincerely, and apprentices learn modestly," and carried out activities of respecting teachers and loving apprentices. The Daqiao Iron Factory also carried out a technical collaboration to protect the furnace as if protecting one's life, and the entire factory supported the effort if there was a furnace accident. The county's commerce, transportation, postal and telecommunications, culture, health and other departments also tried every means to fully support steel production.

Now, the people of Lianyuan County are fighting hard to break through 1,500 tons of daily production before the end of September and achieve the great task of producing 200,000 tons of iron this year.

### 湖南生铁日产量报双喜  全省超过三千吨　涟源升到一千吨

    湖南生铁日产量报双喜
    全省超过三千吨　涟源升到一千吨
    本报长沙16日电　9月上旬，湖南省生铁生产突飞猛进，9月1日全省生铁日产量是一千零三十四吨，到10日就跃进到三千二百七十三吨，超过省委提出的9月10日日产三千吨生铁的指标。这是湖南省生铁生产中空前未有的新纪录。
    湖南省生铁生产所以能在短短十天内飞跃增长，主要是全党全民一齐动手，把钢铁生产作为重大的政治任务来完成。以各级党委第一书记为首的三万多名干部，在这一旬中都开赴钢铁生产的最前线。全省参加生铁生产的劳动大军也由8月底的一百一十万人，激增到现在的二百万人。由于党委第一书记亲自挂帅，广大干部亲临前线，生产中的许多矛盾和关键性问题，都开始顺利解决。很多地区大开小煤窑，大搞土法炼焦，大力推广白煤炼铁，初步解决了燃料赶不上去的困难。各地发动群众，充分运用牛车、土车、架空索道等一切运输工具，交通部门的车辆船只都首先满足钢铁生产的需要，使一度紧张的运输情况有了缓和。宁乡等县采取短期轮训，巡回检查，吸收社会上有炼铁技术的人材，召开现场会议等办法，迅速培养了一批技术力量。
    为了巩固上旬的战果，争取中、下旬生产更多的生铁，中共湖南省委在11日晚上召开有各地、市委第一书记参加的电话会议。省委鼓励各地总结经验，乘胜前进，争取在中旬、下旬创造更大的成绩。省委提出了全省要在中旬日产生铁五千吨、下旬日产生铁一万吨的指标，要求各地力争超额完成。
    本报讯　据新湖南报消息：涟源县9月10日日产生铁一千零四点四吨，创造了湖南省有史以来土炉炼铁的新纪录。
    早在8月底，中共涟源县委就向全党全民提出了在9月10日以前突破日产千吨关的重大政治任务。为了保证突破这个大关，从县委到乡党委第一书记全部上马挂帅，临阵指挥。全县还抽调二千九百多名干部投入了钢铁生产。为了保证炉子正常出铁，并出好铁，又采取了六定、六到炉的积极措施。六定是定干部、定技术、定劳力、定原料、定产量、定时间；六到炉是生产到炉、指导到炉、试验到炉、开会到炉、吃饭到炉、睡觉到炉。在解决了领导和劳力问题后，最大的就是燃料问题。全县开展了一个共产主义大协作。县委从各乡抽调劳力，组织了一个二万一千人的突击运输大队，从马方煤矿抢运出六千八百吨焦炭，及时有力地支援了安平、人和等大铁厂。在突破技术关方面，洄水、大桥和七星铁厂采取领导、技术员、学徒三结合的办法，并提出师傅真心教、徒弟虚心学的口号，开展了尊师爱徒的活动，大桥铁厂还开展了一个保炉如保命、一炉出事故全厂大支援的技术大协作。全县商业、交通运输、邮电、文化、卫生等部门也想方设法，全力支援钢铁。
    现在，涟源县人民正在为9月底以前日产突破一千五百吨，实现今年产铁二十万吨的伟大任务而苦战。
