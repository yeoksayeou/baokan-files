The unprecedented agricultural bumper harvest in China's history has become a certainty. The fruits of victory from the nationwide farmers' year of hard work are about to be reaped. The total output of grain and the total output of cotton and tobacco this year will increase several times compared with 1957. The production of bast fiber and oil crops will also increase significantly compared with last year. The average amount of grain per person nationwide will reach more than 1,000 jin, and the lives of the Chinese people will become more prosperous. This is a great event that excites the people across the country. Victory is not only on the agricultural front. On the industrial front, the production of heavy industrial sectors such as steel, machinery, and electricity is also advancing steadily. The people across the country are working hard towards the great task of reaching a steel output of 10.7 million tons. As for the increase in the output and the improvement in the quality of light industrial products, it is something everyone can see. In large and small stores, all kinds of dazzling daily necessities fill all the shelves. The total amount of national commodity inventory has greatly increased compared with the past. Under the shining light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the whole country is full of prosperity.

The great agricultural harvest and the great industrial development have put forward very urgent tasks for the current commercial work. This requires Party committees and relevant departments at all levels to focus on procurement, sales, transportation, and storage with greater efforts this winter and next spring, and further vigorously implement the state's policy of large-scale procurement and large-scale sales. A large amount of agricultural products must be purchased in a timely manner; a large amount of industrial products must be organized for supply in a timely manner; allocation, transportation, and storage must also closely follow the needs of increased production and expanded circulation. As everyone knows, production is the foundation of economic life, production determines circulation, and at the same time, circulation can have a certain influence and effect on production. Doing a good job in circulation can promote the development of production. Currently, production has increased so much. If circulation cannot be expanded accordingly, economic life will become unbalanced. Therefore, while focusing on industrial and agricultural production, Party committees at all levels must also give due attention to the work of commodity circulation. Regarding how to complete the current pressing tasks of commercial work, we put forward the following points:

First, it is necessary to vigorously organize procurement, ensure the needs of the state, and fully meet the requirements of people's communes and agricultural cooperatives to sell agricultural and sideline products. Compared with 1957, the total value of agricultural and sideline products purchased this year will not increase by a few percentage points, or a few tens of percentage points, but will more than double. Among them, some products such as flue-cured tobacco may increase three to five times. If Party committees at all levels do not grasp and properly arrange such a large procurement task, it cannot be completed. We should purchase all kinds of agricultural and sideline products and local specialties sold by people's communes and agricultural cooperatives according to the plan, and fully meet the requirements of agricultural cooperatives and people's communes to sell. Cotton, hemp, tobacco, etc., should be accepted without refusal, the more the better. Regarding the issue of grain purchase, in order to completely eliminate the farmers' certain nervous psychological state about grain distribution over the past few years and promote a greater leap forward in agricultural production, the government has decided that although grain production has increased significantly this year, the state will still maintain last year's purchase level of 88 billion jin. The original grain contract task announced to agricultural cooperatives by various localities is still the same now, and production will increase without increasing purchases. People's communes, agricultural cooperatives, and farmers should all store part of the grain. If people's communes and agricultural cooperatives actively request to sell more surplus grain to the state in order to solve the problem of funds, the state can purchase it, and purchasing departments should not refuse. However, the quantity of sweet potato slices purchased must be appropriately controlled. Because it is easier for the masses to store sweet potato slices in a decentralized manner, and it is easier to handle them, while it is difficult for the state to store and handle them in a centralized manner. In addition to grain, oil, cotton, hemp, tobacco, and other major agricultural products, there are also local specialties that account for about 30% of the total value of agricultural and sideline products. These local specialties are diverse and widely distributed. They seem to be scattered and small, but when concentrated, they are a huge wealth of our country. These local specialties play an important role in meeting the diverse needs of the country, increasing people's income, organizing exports, and earning foreign exchange, and they should also be well organized for purchase. In order to do a good job in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, it is hoped that all localities will immediately start to check whether the cadres' thinking has clearly recognized the important significance of vigorously organizing procurement, what the specific preparations are, how the purchasing points and transfer stations are arranged, how the packaging materials (gunny bags, oil drums, iron wire, iron sheets, etc.) are prepared, and what other organizational work is being done.

Second, it is necessary to actively organize supplies and do everything possible to meet farmers' needs for means of production and means of livelihood. After a bumper harvest, farmers require appropriately improving their lives. At present, the inventory of most means of livelihood has increased a lot compared with last year, and the supply of goods is relatively abundant. In addition to grain, oil, and cloth, which should still be supplied according to the plan, other daily necessities should be supplied freely as long as the supply of goods is sufficient, and farmers' requirements should be fully met. At present, the main problem is in the supply of agricultural means of production. The farmers of our country, who have communist consciousness and great ambitions, are not satisfied with the existing bumper harvest, nor are they in a hurry to improve their immediate lives. Their fundamental requirement is to rapidly and substantially increase agricultural production, and they urgently need to greatly increase the supply of agricultural means of production. At present, although the growth of agricultural means of production far exceeds the growth of means of livelihood, there is still a distance from the farmers' growing huge needs for means of production. In order to solve this problem, efforts should be made to organize the production and supply of agricultural means of production while ensuring the country's key construction. The main methods are: all localities should rely on their own efforts, use local materials, manufacture locally, and supply locally. While doing a good job in the supply of materials, it is also necessary to pay attention to doing a good job in credit withdrawal. The state should recover overdue agricultural loans from agricultural cooperatives and farmers; recover advance payment deposits for agricultural products from relevant units; and in conjunction with the procurement of agricultural products, earnestly do a good job in the deposit work of people's communes, agricultural cooperatives, and individual farmers. Because the supply of means of production falls short of demand, it is also possible to consider implementing the method of ordering means of production in advance, paying the state in advance, and picking up the goods next year or the year after. In order to do a good job in the supply of materials, it is hoped that all localities will immediately check how you have arranged for the supply of materials, how the preparations for the supply of agricultural means of production and means of livelihood are, and whether the existing commodities supplied to rural areas have been transferred to the "front line". Whether the goods are suitable, whether they are timely, how the follow-up goods are prepared, and how the commercial departments are cooperating with all parties to organize the supply of goods.

Third, it is necessary to launch a mass transportation movement to ensure the smooth flow of goods. This year, various modern and rural transportation tools have greatly increased and improved, and transportation efficiency has also greatly improved. However, judging from the new situation of the greatly increased current transportation tasks, it still cannot keep up with the objective needs. The transportation task in the second half of this year is even more arduous. According to the estimates of the three ministries of grain, commerce, and foreign trade, the total transportation volume will increase by more than double compared with the same period last year. If five-ton trucks are used for transportation, the trucks can be lined up to circle the earth four and a half times. Can such an arduous transportation task be completed? We believe that as long as we further mobilize and rely on the masses, the task can be completed. Specifically, a combination of modern transportation tools and mass transportation forces should be implemented, and efforts should be strengthened from two aspects: on the one hand, the effectiveness of modern transportation tools should be fully utilized; on the other hand, the effectiveness of rural transportation forces should be fully utilized. Modern transportation tools such as trains, ships, and automobiles should be uniformly arranged and rationally used under the principle of both taking into account the needs of national production and construction and the needs of market supply. Efforts should be made to increase the load capacity, maximize the use of return trips, and reduce waste. On the issue of rural transportation, a principle of combining blitz transportation and regular transportation should also be implemented. Several mass transportation movements should be launched this winter and next spring to organize a larger rural transportation force to carry out blitz transportation within a few days. At the same time, a comprehensive plan should be made for the rural labor force, and appropriate arrangements should be made to complete both the production tasks and the commodity transportation tasks.

Fourth, it is necessary to combine the strength of the state with the strength of the masses to jointly do a good job in the storage, preservation, and processing of commodities. This year, the quantity of purchases and sales is very large, and the problem of commodity storage must be well solved, otherwise it will cause the products to mold, deteriorate, and even cause unnecessary losses to the state and the people. The solution is to combine the strength of the state with the strength of the people's communes, agricultural cooperatives, and the masses, and fully follow the mass line. For example, for the construction of warehouses, the state can provide some money and materials, and at the same time mobilize the masses to provide labor to build together. The experience of Luoyang, Henan in building grain warehouses using this method can be used as a reference for various localities. At the same time, Party committees at all levels should guide people's communes and agricultural cooperatives to build their own warehouses in order to store a large amount of materials such as grain. If the warehouse cannot be completely solved for a while, the masses can also be mobilized to adopt the method of family storage, which is a good method. The problem of processing agricultural products should also be solved by making efforts to improve the effectiveness of existing equipment and increase processing equipment, based on the principle of combining the strength of the state and the masses.

In general, the above four points require all localities to do a good job in procurement, supply, transportation, and storage. Here, we would like to emphasize in particular that the commercial work in the first half of this year has generally made great progress. With the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, commercial work is also leaping forward. However, a small number of commercial cadres have a tendency to neglect purchase and sales work, and the purchase work of certain agricultural and sideline products has not been completed well. For example, the number of live pigs raised this year has increased, but the supply of pork in some large cities has recently been relatively tight. Obviously, the emergence of this situation, in addition to other reasons, neglecting purchase and sales work is an important factor. In the future, we must strive to overcome the shortcomings of some commercial workers who neglect purchase and sales, ensure that we do a good job in this year's purchase and sales work, and raise our country's commercial work to a higher level.

The tasks currently facing commercial work are more arduous than at any time in the past. However, as long as Party committees at all levels further strengthen leadership, as long as we further implement putting politics in command, better mobilize the staff and workers of commercial departments and the broad masses of society, and give play to collective wisdom and strength, we will surely be able to create various new methods to overcome difficulties and complete the glorious tasks on the commercial front perfectly and excellently. In this way, on the basis of the great leap forward in production, it will certainly promote a new situation of unprecedented prosperity and unprecedented activity in China's economic life, and promote a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    当前商业工作的迫切任务
    我国历史上空前未有的农业大丰收已成定局，全国农民苦战一年的胜利果实就要到手了。今年的粮食总产量和棉花、烟叶的总产量，将会比1957年成倍地增长。麻类、油料也将比去年增长很多。全国每人占有粮食的平均数将要达到一千斤以上，我国人民生活将更加丰裕起来。这是振奋全国人心的大喜事。胜利不仅在农业方面，在工业战线上，钢铁、机械、电力等重工业部门的生产也正在节节前进，全国人民正在为钢的产量达到一千零七十万吨的伟大任务而紧张战斗。至于轻工业品产量的增加和质量的提高，更是人人可以看到的。在大大小小的商店中，各色各样琳琅满目的日用品摆满了所有的货架。国家商品库存的总额比过去大大增加了。在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，全国到处充满兴旺景象。
    农业的大丰收和工业的大发展，对当前商业工作提出了非常迫切的任务。这就是要求各地党委和有关部门在今冬明春以更大的力量抓好收购、销售、调运、储存等工作，进一步大力贯彻国家规定的大购大销的方针。大量的农产品必须及时地收购起来；大量的工业品必须及时地组织供应；调拨运输和储存保管，也必须紧紧地跟上生产增加和流通扩大的需要。大家知道，生产是经济生活的根本，生产决定流通，同时，流通对生产也可以发生一定的影响和作用。做好流通工作就能促进生产的发展。目前生产增加了这么多，如果流通不能相应地扩大，经济生活就要发生失调现象。因此，各地党委在抓紧工业生产和农业生产的基础上，还必须对商品流通方面的工作予以应有的重视。关于怎样完成当前商业工作的迫切任务，我们提出以下几点意见：
    第一，要大力组织收购，保证国家需要，充分满足人民公社和农业合作社出售农副产品的要求。今年农副产品收购的总值，同1957年比较起来，不是增加百分之十几，百分之几十，而是增加一倍以上，其中有的产品如烤烟等，可能增加三倍到五倍。这样大的收购任务，如果各地党委不抓紧妥善安排，是完成不了的。人民公社和农业社出售的各种农副产品和土特产品，我们应当按计划收购起来，充分满足农业社和人民公社出售的要求。棉、麻、烟等，应当是来者不拒，多多益善。关于粮食征购问题，为了彻底清除几年来农民在粮食分配问题上的某些紧张心理，促进农业生产更大的跃进，政府已经决定：今年虽然粮食大量增产了，但是国家仍然维持去年征购八百八十亿斤的水平。各地方原来向农业社宣布的粮食包干任务是多少，现在仍然是多少，增产不增购。人民公社、农业社和农户都应当储存一部分粮食。如果人民公社和农业社为了解决资金问题，主动地要求多卖余粮给国家，国家可以收购下来，收购部门不要拒绝。但是收购薯干的数量必须适当控制。因为薯干由群众分散储存更便于保管，便于处理，而国家集中保管和处理，则有很多困难。除了粮、油、棉、麻、烟等几种主要农产品以外，还有约占农副产品全部产值30％的土特产品，这些土特产品种类繁多，分布极广，看来似乎零星细小，但是集中起来就是我们国家的一笔巨大的财富。这些土特产品对于供应国内多种多样的需要，增加人民收入和组织出口、换取外汇，都具有重要的作用，也应该很好地组织收购。为了做好农副产品的收购工作，希望各地立即着手检查一下：在干部思想上是否都明确认识了大力组织收购的重要意义，具体准备工作如何，收购点和转运站的安排如何，包装用具（麻袋、油桶、铁丝、铁皮等）准备如何，其它组织工作如何。  
    第二，要积极组织供应，千方百计地满足农民对生产资料和生活资料的需求。农民在大丰收以后，要求适当地改善他们的生活。目前，绝大部分生活资料的库存比去年增加很多，货源也比较充裕。除了粮、油、布仍然应当按计划供应以外，其它各种生活日用品，只要货源充足，就应当放手供应，充分满足农民的要求。目前主要问题是在农业生产资料供应方面。具有共产主义觉悟和远大志气的我国农民，并不满足于已有的丰收，也并不急于改善眼前的生活，他们的根本要求是迅速更大幅度地提高农业生产，他们迫切需要大大地增加农业生产资料的供应。目前农业生产资料的增长，虽然远远超过生活资料增长的幅度，但是，同农民对于生产资料日益增长的巨大需要仍然有距离。为了解决这个问题，应当在保证国家重点建设的前提下，千方百计地组织农业生产资料的生产和供应。主要办法是：各地自力更生，就地取材，就地制造，就地供应。在做好物资供应工作的同时，还必须注意做好信用回笼工作。国家要向农业社和农民收回到期的农业贷款；向有关单位收回农产品预购定金；并且结合农产品的收购，切实做好人民公社、农业社和农民个人的存款工作。由于生产资料供不应求，还可以考虑实行预订生产资料的办法，先向国家预付货款，明年或者后年取货。为了做好物资供应工作，希望各地立即检查一下：你们对物资供应的安排如何，农业生产资料和生活资料供应的准备如何，供应农村的现有商品是否已经调到“前沿阵地”。货物对路不对路，及时不及时，后续商品准备如何，商业部门同各方协作组织货源的情况如何。
    第三，要开展群众性的运输运动，保证货畅其流。今年各种现代化的和农村的运输工具都有很大的增加和改进，运输效率也有了很大的提高。但是，从当前运输任务大大增加的新情况来看，仍然赶不上客观的需要。今年下半年运输任务更加繁重。根据粮食、商业、对外贸易等三个部的估计，运输总量将比去年同期增加一倍以上。如果用载重五吨的大卡车装运，把卡车排列起来，可以环绕地球四周半。这样繁重的运输任务能不能完成呢？我们认为，只要进一步发动和依靠群众，任务是可以完成的。具体来说，应当实行现代化运输工具和群众运输力量相结合的办法，从两方面加强努力：一方面充分地发挥现代化运输工具的效能；另一方面充分地发挥农村运输力的效能。火车、轮船、汽车等现代化运输工具都应当在既照顾国家生产建设的需要，又照顾市场供应需要的原则下，统一安排，合理调用，要努力提高载重量，尽量利用回空，减少浪费。在农村运输问题上，还应当实行突击运输和经常运输相结合的原则。今冬明春要开展几次群众性的运输运动，组织较多的农村运输力，在几天之内进行突击运输。同时，应当对农村劳动力进行全面规划，适当安排，既要完成各项生产任务，又要完成商品调运任务。
    第四，要把国家的力量同群众的力量结合起来，共同做好商品的储存保管和加工的工作。今年购销数量很大，必须很好地解决商品储存问题，否则就会使产品霉烂、变质，以至造成国家和人民不应有的损失。解决的办法是把国家同人民公社、农业社和群众的力量结合起来，充分走群众路线。比如仓库的修建，可以由国家出一些钱和材料，同时发动群众出劳力，共同修建。河南洛阳采用这种办法修建粮食仓库的经验，可供各地参考。同时，各地党委要指导人民公社和农业社，修建自己的仓库，以便大量储存粮食等物资。仓库一时难以完全解决的，还可以发动群众，采取家庭保管的办法，这是好办法。农产品的加工问题，也应当根据国家和群众力量相结合的原则，从提高现有设备的效能和增加加工设备等方面，努力设法解决。
    以上四个问题，总的说来，就是要求各地做到收购好、供应好、调运好、储存好。在这里，我们要特别强调指出，今年上半年的商业工作，总的看来有很大的进步，随着工农业生产的跃进，商业工作也是跃进的，但是少数商业干部有忽视购销工作的倾向，某些农副产品的收购工作完成得不够好。例如，今年生猪饲养的头数增加了，但是某些大城市的猪肉供应最近反而比较紧张。很显然，这种情况的出现，除了其他原因以外，忽视购销工作是重要的因素。今后必须努力克服某些商业工作人员中忽视购销的缺点，保证做好今年的购销工作，把我国的商业工作提到更高的水平。
    目前商业工作所面临的任务比过去任何时期都要繁重。但是，只要各地党委进一步加强领导，只要进一步实行政治挂帅，更好地发动商业部门的职工群众和广大社会群众，发挥集体的智慧和力量，就一定可以创造出各种各样克服困难的新办法，完满地出色地完成商业战线上的光荣任务。这样，也就一定会在生产大跃进的基础上，促使我国的经济生活出现空前繁荣、空前活跃的新局面，促进工农业生产的更大的跃进。
