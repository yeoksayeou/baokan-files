At discussion meetings held at the Stalin Coal Mine and the Ludvik Coal Mine, workers said that they would tell the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek clique that truth and strength are on our side.

Some factories manufacturing orders for China have pledged to deliver their goods early, in order to contribute to the just struggle of the Chinese people. Workers at the Vitkovice Steel Works pledged to complete a power station being built for China twenty-one days ahead of schedule.
