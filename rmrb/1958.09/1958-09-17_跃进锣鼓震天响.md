The Leap Forward drums resound to the heavens,
The Marshal of Steel sits in his precious tent.
Smiling, he surveys the billions of camps—
	Camp after camp of high furnaces, banners flying high;
Smiling, he sees the troops are well-equipped and the food supply ample—
	Mountains and fields are full of mineral deposits.
After surveying, the Marshal issues an order:
The Steel Army goes to the battlefield!
Go into battle and defeat John Bull,
Return to camp and rewards will be given according to merit.

    跃进锣鼓震天响
    赵鹏万跃进锣鼓震天响，钢铁元帅坐宝帐。笑看军营亿万座——座座高炉旌旗扬；笑看兵精粮充足——满山遍野是矿藏。元帅看罢传将令：钢铁大军赴战场！上阵打败约翰牛，回阵论功再行赏。
