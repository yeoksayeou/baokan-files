The Rising Sun
By Our Correspondent Shi Yue'e

The Jiangsu Province recently held a work-study exhibition, and the exhibits and products were truly dazzling and beautiful. This fully demonstrates the great significance and unlimited vitality of the Party's education policy.

At the exhibition, there was a colorful embroidered quilt cover, with embroidered mandarin ducks playing in the water, lifelike. This embroidered mandarin duck quilt cover is the work of Wang Xiawen, a first-year student at Guangfu Middle School in Wuxian County. She is only fifteen years old this year and has been learning embroidery for only three years. Now, her embroidery skills have reached the first-class export level. People asked Wang Xiawen, "How did you learn such good needlework at such a young age?" She held out her hands and told everyone: "These same hands couldn't embroider well in the past, but today they can embroider products for export, and this is the result of work-study." She added, "Embroidered quilt covers can be exchanged for steel, and learning embroidery can indirectly serve the steel industry." Therefore, with the will of steel and the patience of an embroidery girl, she observed, asked questions, studied diligently, and practiced hard, improving her embroidery skills. In order to embroider like a flower or a leaf, Wang Xiawen actively participated in planting flowers and trees, carefully observing the shapes of flowers and trees.

Since the launch of work-study programs, female students in Suzhou schools have set up embroidery groups one after another, and a large number of embroidery experts have emerged. They are not only clever and skillful embroidery girls, but also knowledgeable and ideal handicraft workers. In the past six months, among the forty-five members of the Guangfu Middle School embroidery group, six students have reached the first-class export standard in embroidery skills, and two have reached the top-grade export standard. This embroidery group has processed more than 380 finished products for the country, exchanging them for a lot of steel and foreign exchange for the country.

In a corner of the exhibition, there were several extraordinary plants. One plant had a sunflower growing on top and ginger growing underneath; another plant had tomatoes growing on top and potatoes growing underneath, both growing lushly with abundant fruit. This is called the "two-story building" grafting method, which was successfully created by the students of the "Michurin" group at Shiyang Junior Middle School. Students such as Yu Linshu failed five times in a row in the process of grafting the "two-story building" but were not discouraged. They persisted in the experiment and finally succeeded in grafting sunflowers onto ginger for the sixth time.

After the great leap forward in agricultural production, someone asked whether it was possible to manufacture a fertilizer that could be used to watch plants grow? At the exhibition, people saw a bottle of fast-acting fertilizer, which could be used to watch plants grow. The students of Chouji Primary School in Fengxian County applied this fertilizer to one mu of cotton field in the experimental field. The next day, the cotton seedlings immediately changed color, and the third day, the cotton seedlings were one-third taller than before. This magical fast-acting fertilizer is a product of the Red Scarf Fertilizer Factory of Chouji Primary School in Shiyan Township, Fengxian County. After this school launched work-study activities this year, the children successfully trial-produced it using local methods in order to support the great leap forward in agricultural production. This fertilizer can be made by using a small amount of millet plus wood ash and other things. Before the summer vacation this year, the Chouji Primary School Red Scarf Factory had built 600 pools and produced more than 3,000 jin of fast-acting fertilizer (equivalent to 9 million jin of natural fertilizer). Now, this fast-acting local fertilizer has been widely promoted throughout Fengxian County.

On the other side of the exhibition, there was a telephone. "Ring ring... ring ring..." As the phone rang, the person on the other end held his breath, and after the bell rang five times, this strange telephone—the "telephone secretary"—volunteered to answer the phone. The "telephone secretary" told the other party: "This is Nanjing Telecommunications School, no one is here now, I am a tape recorder, you can tell me what you want, I will record it and pass it on to the owner." Then it recorded all the other party's words verbatim. After a while, the owner came back and turned on the "telephone secretary," and heard what had just been recorded.

The flowers of work-study in Jiangsu Province schools have already borne fruitful results. From here, we can see that after the young generation has devoted themselves to work-study, their wisdom is beginning to shine like the rising sun. Young people! Your tomorrow will surely be more brilliant and glorious.

    初升的太阳
    本报记者　史越峨
    江苏省最近举办勤工俭学展览会，展出的实物和产品，真是琳琅满目，美不胜收。这充分显示出党的教育方针的伟大意义和无限生命力。
    在展览会上，陈列着一条五彩缤纷的绣花被面，上面绣的鸳鸯戏水，栩栩如生。这条绣鸳鸯的被面是吴县光福中学一年级学生王霞文的作品。她今年才十五岁，学习刺绣不过三年时间。现在，她的刺绣技术已经达到甲级出口水平。人们问王霞文：“你小小的年纪，怎样学得一手好针线的呢？”她伸出手告诉大家：“同是这双手，过去绣不好，今天可以绣出国产品，这是勤工俭学的结果。”她又说：“绣花被面可以换钢，学会刺绣就可以间接为钢铁服务。”因此，她以钢铁的意志，绣花姑娘的耐心，多看多问，勤学苦练，提高了刺绣技术。王霞文为了要绣像一朵花、一片叶，就积极参加栽花植树，细心观察花和树的形状。
    开展勤工俭学活动之后，苏州各学校的女同学们纷纷成立刺绣小组，涌现出大批刺绣能手。她们不仅是心灵手巧的绣花姑娘，而且是有知识有理想的手工艺工人。半年来，光福中学刺绣小组的四十五人中已有六个同学的刺绣技术达到一级品出口标准，两个人已达到甲级出口标准。这个刺绣小组已为国家加工三百八十多件成品，替国家换回不少的钢材和外汇。
    在展览会的一角，摆着几盆出奇的植物，有一盆植物，上面结一球向日葵，下面长洋生姜；另一盆是上面长番茄，下面长马铃薯，都长得枝叶茂盛，果实丰满。这叫“二层楼”嫁接法，是时扬初中“米丘林”小组的同学们创造成功的。于林书等同学在嫁接“二层楼”的过程中一连失败了五次仍不灰心。他们坚持试验，第六次把向日葵嫁接在洋生姜上，终于获得了成功。
    农业生产大跃进之后，有人提出能不能制造一种眼看着植物生长的肥料？在展览会上，人们看到一瓶速效肥料，用这种土化肥，就能眼看着植物生长。丰县仇集小学的同学们在试验田的一亩棉花地里追施了这种肥料，第二天棉苗立即变了颜色，第三天棉苗就比原来高出三分之一。这种神奇的速效肥料是丰县师岩乡仇集小学红领巾化肥厂的产品。今年这个学校开展勤工俭学活动之后，孩子们为了支援农业生产大跃进，用土法试制成功的。这种肥料只要用少量小米加上草木灰等其他东西，就可以制成。今年暑假前，仇集小学红领巾工厂已经建造了六百个池，制造速效肥料三千多斤（相当于九百万斤自然肥料）。现在，这种速效土化肥已经在丰县各地普遍推广。
    在展览会的另一面，放着一架电话机。“的铃铃……的铃铃……”一阵电话铃响，对面一位打电话的人屏住气，等铃响了五次以后，这部奇怪的电话机——“电话秘书”，便自告奋勇地把电话接下来了。“电话秘书”告诉对方说：“这里是南京电信学校，现在没有人在，我是录音机，你有什么话可以告诉我，我会录下来转告主人。”接着它就一字不漏地把对方的话全部录下来了。一会儿，主人回来打开“电话秘书”，便听到了刚才录下来的话。
    江苏省各学校的勤工俭学之花已经结出丰硕之果。从这里可以看到年轻的一代在投入勤工俭学以后，他们的智慧正像初升的太阳一般开始放出异彩。年青的人们！你们的明天定将更加灿烂光辉。
