Arrange Outlets for Rural Funds Early
Sichuan Peasants Prepare to Vigorously Develop Industry, Produce More New Farm Tools, and Build Welfare Undertakings

(Reported by our correspondent Liu Zongtang) What to do with the increased money of the peasants? This is one of the new problems brought about by the large increase in agricultural and sideline production this year. Various places in Sichuan have paid attention to this problem in a timely manner, and decided to increase public accumulation in the distribution, and arranged the use of public accumulation according to the wishes of the peasants - in addition to being used to expand investment in next year's production, they will vigorously develop industry, vigorously reform farm tools, and run some cultural and welfare undertakings, so that every penny can play its greatest effect.

This year, Sichuan Province's agricultural and sideline production and agricultural co-operative-run industries have all achieved large increases in production. The total output value of these three aspects is expected to reach more than 10 billion yuan, an increase of 4 billion yuan compared with last year. Party committees in various places have promptly put forward plans to increase public accumulation based on this situation. Due to the deep roots of the General Line, the vast number of peasants enthusiastically agreed to expand public accumulation in the discussion of the distribution budget. This year, on the basis of ensuring that farmers increase their income, the public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives throughout the province will reach more than 2 billion yuan, an increase of nearly ten times compared with last year. In addition to fixed assets and materials, there is also a large amount of cash in these public accumulations. How to use this huge amount of funds in the most needed places is an important topic that each agricultural cooperative must consider. According to investigations by relevant departments, many agricultural cooperatives still find it difficult to deal with the sharply increased public accumulation this year, and generally one-third of the money has nowhere to be used; individual cooperatives plan to use too much for non-productive construction or some things that are not urgently needed.

The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed various places to pay attention to this issue as early as mid-August. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the Party committees in various places immediately made overall plans, combined with mass discussions to distinguish between priorities and make proper arrangements for the use of public accumulation. According to the reflections of peasants in various places when discussing the use of public accumulation, in addition to hoping to expand investment in next year's production and strive for greater harvests, they also have three major new requirements: (1) Vigorously develop industry, build more power stations, factories and mines; (2) Purchase and manufacture more new-style farm tools to achieve semi-mechanization as soon as possible; (3) Build residential areas, public canteens, run schools and rural hospitals, etc. Generally, the funds planned to be used for industrial development account for about 20% of the public accumulation, and more than 30% in areas with better conditions. Various places have also allocated a portion of the funds to run some cultural, welfare and health undertakings. Neijiang Prefecture alone plans to invest more than 19 million yuan in cultural and welfare undertakings. Leshan Prefecture plans to help peasants build residential areas, schools, and rural hospitals in a planned way.

Although the public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives has increased a lot this year, the average private income of peasants will still be 100 jin of grain and a certain amount of cash more than last year. Many peasants are certain that they will still have some money that they cannot spend for the time being. The Party committees in various places decided to combine the budget allocation work, and after the autumn, they will once again conduct a widespread and in-depth socialist education movement among the peasants, encouraging them to invest their surplus funds in industrial construction.

### 及早给农村资金安排出路  四川农民准备大办工业，多造新农具，兴建福利事业

　　及早给农村资金安排出路
    四川农民准备大办工业，多造新农具，兴建福利事业
    本报讯　记者刘宗棠报道：农民钱多了怎么办？这是今年农副业大增产后带来的新问题之一。四川各地及时注意到这个问题，决定在分配中增加公共积累，并根据农民愿望对公共积累的使用作了安排——除用于扩大明年生产投资外，将要大办工业、大搞农具改革和兴办一些文化福利事业，使每分钱都能发挥最大的效用。
    今年四川省农副业生产和农业社社办工业都获得大增产，这三方面的总产值预计可达一百亿元以上，比去年增加四十亿元。各地党委根据这一情况及时提出增加公共积累的方案。由于总路线的深入人心，广大农民在讨论分配预算方案中热烈赞同扩大公共积累。全省农业社今年在保证农民增加收入的基础上，公共积累将要达到二十多亿元，比去年增加将近十倍。这些公共积累中除固定资财和实物外，还有一大笔现金。如何把这笔巨额资金使用到最需要的地方，已是各农业社必须考虑的重要课题。据有关部门调查，许多农业社对今年剧增的公共积累一时还感到难于处理，一般都有三分之一的钱没处使用；个别的社打算把过多的用于非生产建设或一些不急需的地方。
    中共四川省委早在8月中指示各地重视这一问题。各地党委根据省委指示，立即作了全面规划，结合群众性的讨论分别轻重缓急，妥善地安排了公共积累的用途。据各地农民在讨论公共积累的使用时反映，他们除了希望扩大明年生产投资争取更大丰收外，还有三大新的要求：（1）大办工业，多修电站、厂矿；（2）多购制新式农具，早日实现半机械化；（3）兴建居民点、公共食堂、办学校和乡村医院等。一般计划用来兴办工业的资金约占公共积累的20％，条件较好的地区达到30％以上。各地也都划出一部分资金用来兴办一些文化福利保健事业。内江专区单是计划投资文化福利事业方面的资金就有一千九百多万元。乐山专区打算帮助农民有计划地兴修居民点、学校、乡村医院等。
    今年虽然农业社的公共积累增加很多，农民私人收入每人平均仍要比去年多分一百斤粮食和一定数量的现金。许多农民肯定还要有一些钱暂时花不出去的。各地党委决定结合预算配分工作，秋后将再一次向农民进行广泛深入的社会主义教育运动，鼓励农民将多余资金投资工业建设。
