    The Sino-US talks, resumed in Warsaw, have been underway for two weeks now, drawing worldwide attention. Judging from the current indications, the United States has shown no sincerity in peacefully resolving the international dispute between China and the United States in the Taiwan Strait. On the contrary, the United States has recently been intensifying its military buildup in the Taiwan Strait region, engaging in increasingly frequent military provocations against the Chinese people, while at the same time playing the trick of a so-called "ceasefire," attempting to obstruct the Chinese people from recovering Jinmen and Mazu. In his speech on September 11, Eisenhower said: "We believe there is an urgent need to make arrangements to stop the shelling." Dulles also said at the United Nations General Assembly on September 18: "We hope to achieve a ceasefire soon." In short, according to the United States, in order to resolve the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait, what is "urgently needed" is not for the United States to immediately stop its military provocations and threats of war in the region, nor is it for the US military forces to immediately withdraw from China's territory of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait region, but rather for the Chinese people to stop taking military action against the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Jinmen and Mazu, and to abandon their sacred sovereignty to liberate their own territory, and implement the so-called "ceasefire" according to the US plan.

    In his statement issued on September 20, Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi sternly refuted the US "ceasefire" proposal. Foreign Minister Chen Yi said, "The tense situation in the Taiwan Strait is entirely caused by US imperialism's aggression against our country. The key to eliminating the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait is not the 'ceasefire' issue, but the withdrawal of US troops from the Taiwan region. There is no war between China and the United States, so there is no 'ceasefire' to speak of. As for the armed struggle between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, it has not stopped since the Chinese People's Liberation War, and it has never caused international tensions. It is entirely the Chinese people's own business whether the Chinese people liberate their territory by peaceful means or by armed struggle."

    In his speech on September 25, Dulles continued to repeat the hackneyed tune of hostility toward the Chinese people, blaming China for refusing to "ceasefire" and saying that it "should be responsible for the danger of war." US State Department spokesman White also asserted: In the Warsaw talks, "the United States will pursue the policy it has always pursued of trying to achieve a ceasefire." It seems that the United States does not hope that the Warsaw talks will reach an agreement that can truly eliminate the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait, but is pursuing ulterior motives, that is, using the talks to cope with the strong condemnation from domestic and foreign public opinion, and using the so-called "ceasefire" plan to achieve the purpose of expanding aggression.

    The current US "ceasefire" conspiracy is a continuation of the claims made by the United States in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks in Geneva in the past. At that time, the US side stubbornly insisted that the US side had the right to use force in the Taiwan region for "individual and collective self-defense." The essence of the US proposition is to confuse the international dispute between China and the United States in the Taiwan region with the internal affairs between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, on the one hand, attempting to deprive the Chinese people of their sacred right to liberate Taiwan, and on the other hand, attempting to retain the US right to use force under the pretext of "self-defense," and asking the Chinese people to recognize the legalization of US occupation of Taiwan. This is, of course, absolutely unacceptable to China. Now, when the Sino-US ambassadorial talks are resumed in Warsaw, the US side has once again raised the so-called "ceasefire" issue. This US "ceasefire" proposal is worse than the US proposal in the Geneva talks in the past.

    In the past, the US side in the Geneva talks only wanted to deprive our people of the sacred right to liberate Taiwan, but now, the so-called "ceasefire" proposed by the United States even attempts to obstruct the Chinese people from recovering Jinmen and Mazu. This means that the US aggression has gone a step further, expanding from Taiwan to Jinmen, Mazu and other Chinese inland sea islands.

    The Chiang Kai-shek clique dispatched one-third of its main force in Taiwan (more than 110,000 people) to Jinmen, Mazu and other coastal islands, and frequently harassed and attacked the mainland and the coast. The battle between the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chiang army has been going on continuously. Especially after the US armed forces invaded Lebanon, the Chiang army became even more rampant, clamoring for a "general offensive against the mainland." The Chinese People's Liberation Army therefore launched a punitive blow against the Chiang army entrenched in Jinmen. Under such circumstances, the US proposal for a "ceasefire" is obviously to maintain Jinmen, Mazu and other coastal islands as a springboard for attacking the mainland. Jinmen and Mazu are originally several small islands, so close to the mainland and so far from Taiwan, but the United States instigated the Chiang Kai-shek clique to gather one-third of its troops there. Why is this? Now that it is completely under the bombardment of the People's Liberation Army's artillery, and the Chiang army is in danger of running out of ammunition and food, the United States still wants the Chiang army to defend it to the death, and even wants to come forward to interfere, attempting to obstruct the Chinese people from recovering these islands. Why is this? Doesn't this fully show that the United States is attempting to maintain these islands as a springboard, preparing to launch a war of aggression against the Chinese mainland?

    Now, the United States has assembled in the Taiwan Strait region what US generals claim to be the largest naval and air force since the end of World War II, blatantly disregarding China's repeated serious warnings, constantly invading China's territorial waters and airspace, and openly clamoring to provoke a local war and a world war to obstruct the Chinese people from recovering Jinmen and Mazu. Under such circumstances, the US proposal for a "ceasefire" is obviously a predetermined step in the US war plan. It attempts to kill two birds with one stone: if the Chinese people ignore the US so-called "ceasefire," the United States can launch an attack on China; if China accepts the US so-called "ceasefire," then, once the Chiang army provokes, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army counterattacks, the United States will take the opportunity to invade Jinmen and Mazu, and can launch a war against China at any time.

    The Chinese people resolutely reject the US so-called "ceasefire." Jinmen and Mazu are Chinese inland sea islands, and recovering these territories is the Chinese people's exercise of sacred sovereignty. The US so-called "ceasefire" is completely interfering in China's internal affairs. Because there is no "ceasefire" issue between China and the United States at all. The US so-called "ceasefire" is to prevent the Chinese people from liberating even those coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu that are constantly threatening the security of the mainland, and to allow the Chiang army to continue to be entrenched there, so as to carry out increasingly rampant harassment and sabotage against the Chinese mainland from there, and also to facilitate the United States to use this as a springboard to further launch a war of aggression against China. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

    According to the US "Daily Telegraph," the US so-called "ceasefire" proposal also includes the requirement that China reduce the Chinese troops on the mainland adjacent to Jinmen, Mazu and other islands. This further exposes the true face of the US so-called "ceasefire." The US so-called "ceasefire" is to prevent the Chinese people from recovering Jinmen, Mazu and other coastal islands, and to allow these places to remain in the hands of the Chiang Kai-shek clique as a forward base for attacking the mainland. The US armed forces assembled in the Taiwan Strait region can also launch an attack on the Chinese mainland at any time. On the contrary, China's troops on the coast must be reduced, which will disintegrate China's coastal defense in front of the US aggressors. This is such an arrogant and greedy demand. The facts are clear: the US aggressors' plan is: first, occupy Taiwan; second, expand the occupation of coastal islands; and third, attack the Chinese mainland. Therefore, the US "ceasefire" is completely unlike what the US side claims, it is by no means a prerequisite for eliminating the danger of war, but a step towards war. The United States' attempt to use the "ceasefire" conspiracy to deceive the great Chinese people and world public opinion is a daydream. The Chinese people deeply know that the US "ceasefire" is completely a scam, which not only cannot find a market in China, but also has fewer and fewer markets around the world.

    US officials say very nicely when selling their "ceasefire" plan, as if once the "ceasefire" is realized, the danger of war can be eliminated, otherwise it would be unimaginable. Of course, the danger of war is indeed serious. On the current Jinmen front, our army's artillery battle against the Chiang army is going on fiercely, and the US planes and warships that constantly invade there are in danger of triggering a major war at any time. However, the reason why this dangerous situation occurred is not due to the civil war between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, because this civil war began as early as twelve years ago, and the scale in the past was many times greater than it is now, but it has never caused international tensions, because this is entirely China's internal affair. The reason why this dangerous situation occurred is entirely because the United States violated the United Nations Charter and all international norms, used force to occupy China's Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and is currently assembling a huge naval and air force in the Taiwan Strait region to carry out military provocations and threats of war against China, and is trying to expand its aggression against China and interfere with the Chinese people's recovery of Jinmen, Mazu and other coastal islands. This is the root cause of the serious war crisis that exists in the Taiwan Strait region. The US authorities often say that they do not want war. If this is not a lie, they should immediately stop their military provocations and threats of war against China, and withdraw their armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait region, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs. This is the fundamental solution to eliminate the war crisis in the Taiwan Strait region. If the United States does not do this, it can only show that it does not want war at all, but very much wants to use the excuse of "defending" Jinmen and Mazu to launch a war against China.

    The Chinese people's determination to recover Jinmen, Mazu and other coastal islands is unshakable. Liberating Taiwan and the Penghu Islands is the Chinese people's sacred and inviolable right. The Chinese people will never tolerate US interference, nor are they afraid of US provocations. There are two paths in front of the United States: either to provoke a hopeless war with the Chiang Kai-shek clique that could lead to its own destruction; or to abandon its policy of aggression and interference against China and resolve the dispute between the two countries in the Taiwan region through peaceful negotiations. Which path to take depends entirely on how the United States chooses. If the United States insists on taking the former path, then, as Foreign Minister Chen Yi said in his statement on September 20, the Chinese people "will not hesitate to sacrifice, under the sacred banner of defending the great motherland, to fight against aggression, to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world." The Chinese government and people are willing to resolve the international dispute between China and the United States through peaceful negotiations. This is China's consistent position. It is for this reason that we had hoped for the resumption of Sino-US talks in Warsaw. However, as soon as the Warsaw talks began, the United States put forward the absurd "ceasefire" proposal, which put the Sino-US talks that the world was expecting into a deadlock from the very beginning. If the United States does not abandon its "ceasefire" conspiracy, this deadlock cannot be broken. All the consequences arising therefrom must be borne by the United States.

### 粉碎美国的所谓“停火”阴谋

    粉碎美国的所谓“停火”阴谋
    举世瞩目的中美会谈，在华沙恢复以来已经两个星期了。从目前各种迹象看来，美国对于和平解决中美两国在台湾海峡地区的国际争端并没有表示任何诚意。相反的，美国最近一边在台湾海峡地区加紧集结庞大的军事力量，对中国人民进行日益频繁的军事挑衅，一边竟又玩弄所谓“停火”的阴谋，妄图阻挠中国人民收复金门、马祖。艾森豪威尔在9月11日的演说中说：“我们认为迫切需要作出安排，以使炮火停止。”杜勒斯9月18日在联合国大会上又说：“我们希望很快实现停火。”总之，按照美国的说法，为了解决台湾海峡地区的紧张局势问题，“迫切需要作出安排”的并不是美国立即停止它在这个地区的军事挑衅和战争威胁，也不是美国军事力量立即从中国领土台湾和台湾海峡地区撤走，倒是要中国人民停止对金门、马祖蒋军采取军事行动，放弃解放自己的领土的神圣主权，按照美国的计划实行所谓“停火”。
    我国陈毅外长在9月20日发表的声明中已经严正地驳斥了美国的“停火”主张。陈毅外长说，“台湾海峡地区的紧张局势完全是美帝国主义对我国的侵略造成的。消除台湾海峡地区的紧张局势的关键，不是什么‘停火’问题，而是美国军队撤出台湾地区的问题。中美之间没有打仗，根本谈不上什么‘停火’。至于中国人民同蒋介石集团之间的武装斗争，那是从中国人民解放战争以来就没有停止过，也从来没有造成国际紧张局势。中国人民为了解放自己的领土，不论用和平方式还是用武装斗争方式，都是中国人民自己的事情。”
    杜勒斯在9月25日的演说中仍然重复敌视中国人民的滥调，责备中国方面拒绝“停火”，说什么“应负战争危险的责任”。美国国务院发言人怀特又扬言：在华沙会谈中“美国将奉行它一直奉行的设法实现停火的政策”。看来，美国并不希望华沙会谈达成真正能够消除台湾海峡地区紧张局势的协议，而是追求不可告人的目的，这就是利用会谈来应付国内外舆论的强烈的责难，利用所谓“停火”方案来达到扩大侵略的目的。
    美国目前的“停火”阴谋，同过去美国在中美两国大使级代表日内瓦会谈中提出的主张是一脉相承的。当时，美国方面一直固执地坚持美方在台湾地区有权为“单独和集体的自卫”使用武力。美国主张的实质，就是把中美两国在台湾地区的国际争端同中国人民和蒋介石集团之间的内政问题混淆起来，一方面企图剥夺中国人民解放台湾的神圣权利，另一方面又企图保留美方以“自卫”为借口使用武力的权利，要中国人民承认美国占领台湾的合法化。这当然是中国绝对不能同意的。现在，在中美大使级代表会谈在华沙恢复的时候，美方又提出所谓“停火”问题。美国的这个“停火”主张，比过去日内瓦会谈中的美国主张更坏。
    在过去日内瓦会谈中美方还只想剥夺我国人民解放台湾的神圣权利，而现在，美国提出的所谓“停火”，竟然妄想阻挠中国人民收复金门、马祖。这就是说，美国的侵略又进了一步，从台湾扩大到金门、马祖等中国内海岛屿。
    蒋介石集团把它在台湾的主力的三分之一（共十一万多人）派遣到金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，经常对大陆和沿海进行骚扰和袭击。中国人民解放军和蒋军之间的战斗一直不断地进行着。特别是美国武装部队侵占黎巴嫩后，蒋军更加猖獗起来，扬言“总攻大陆”。中国人民解放军因此对盘据金门的蒋军进行了惩罚性的打击。在这种情况下，美方提出“停火”，显然是为了保持金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，作为进攻大陆的跳板。金门、马祖原是几个小岛，离大陆这样近而离台湾又那样远，但美国却唆使蒋介石集团集结了三分之一的兵力在那里，这是为什么？现在那里完全处于解放军的大炮轰击之下，蒋军大有弹尽粮绝之势，但美国仍然要蒋军死守那里，并且还要自己出面干涉，企图阻挠中国人民收复这些岛屿，这又是为什么？这不是充分说明美国企图保持这些岛屿作为跳板，准备向中国大陆发动侵略战争吗？
    现在，美国在台湾海峡地区集结了据美国将军们自称是第二次世界大战结束以来最大的海空力量，悍然不顾中国的一再严重警告，不断侵入中国的领海和领空，并且公开扬言不惜挑起局部战争和世界战争来阻挠中国人民收复金门、马祖。在这种情况下，美国提出“停火”，显然是美国战争计划的一个预定步骤。它妄图一箭双雕：如果中国人民不理会美国的所谓“停火”，美国就可以发动对中国的进攻；如果中国接受美国的所谓“停火”，那末，一旦蒋军挑衅，中国人民解放军进行还击的时候，美国就乘机侵占金门、马祖，随时可以发动对中国的战争。
    中国人民坚决拒绝美国的所谓“停火”。金门、马祖是中国的内海岛屿，收复这些领土，是中国人民行使神圣的主权。美国的所谓“停火”，完全是干涉中国内政。因为中美之间根本不存在“停火”的问题。美国的所谓“停火”，就是要中国人民连那些时刻威胁着大陆的安全的金门、马祖等沿海岛屿也不要去解放，而让蒋军继续盘踞在那里，以便从那里对中国大陆进行日益猖狂的骚扰和破坏，同时也便于美国以此作为跳板，进一步发动对中国的侵略战争。这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    据美国“每日电讯”报透露，美国的所谓“停火”主张，还包括要求中国裁减邻近金门、马祖等岛屿的大陆上的中国军队。这就更加暴露了美国的所谓“停火”的真面目。美国的所谓“停火”，就是要中国人民不去收复金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，而让这些地方仍然保留在蒋介石集团手里，作为进攻大陆的前进基地。而集结在台湾海峡地区的美国的武装力量也随时可以向中国大陆发动进攻。相反的，中国在沿海的军队要减少，这就使中国大陆沿海的防御在美国侵略者面前瓦解。这是何等狂妄、何等贪得无厌的要求。事实明摆着：美国侵略者的计划是：第一步占领台湾；第二步扩大占领沿海岛屿；第三步就是进攻中国大陆。因此，美国的“停火”，完全不像美国方面宣传的那样，绝不是消除战争危险的前提，而是导向战争的步骤。美国妄想用“停火”阴谋来欺骗伟大的中国人民和世界舆论，真是白日做梦。中国人民深深知道，美国的“停火”完全是一个骗局，不仅在中国找不到市场，而是在全世界的市场也越来越少了。
    美国的官员们在推销他们的“停火”方案时说得很美妙，似乎一旦实现“停火”，战争的危险就可以消除，否则就不堪设想。当然，战争危险的确是严重的。在目前的金门前线，我军对蒋军的炮战正在激烈地进行着，不断侵入那里的美国飞机军舰随时都有触发大战的危险。但是，这种危险情势的所以发生，并不是由于中国人民同蒋介石集团之间的内战，因为这个内战早在十二年前就开始，而且过去的规模比目前不知大多少倍，但从来没有引起国际紧张局势，因为这完全是中国内部的事情。这种危险情势之所以发生，完全是由于美国违反联合国宪章和一切国际准则，用武力侵占了中国的台湾和澎湖列岛，目前又在台湾海峡地区集结了庞大的海空武装力量，对中国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，并力图扩大对中国的侵略，干涉中国人民恢复金门、马祖等沿海岛屿。这是目前台湾海峡地区存在着严重的大战危机的根源。美国当局常说不希望有战争，如果这不是假话，就应该立即停止对中国的军事挑衅和战争威胁，并且把它的武装力量从台湾和台湾海峡地区撤出去，停止干涉中国的内政。这是消除台湾海峡地区战争危机的根本解决办法。如果美国这样做了，那末，台湾海峡地区的紧张局势马上就会烟消云散。美国如果不这样做，那就只能说明它根本就不是不希望战争，而是很希望借口“保卫”金门、马祖而对中国发动战争。
    中国人民收复金门、马祖等沿海岛屿的决心是不可动摇的。解放台湾和澎湖列岛，是中国人民的神圣不可侵犯的权利。中国人民决不容忍美国的干涉，也不害怕美国的挑衅。摆在美国面前的有两条道路：或者是同蒋介石集团一道挑起一场毫无希望而且可使自己遭到毁灭的战争；或者放弃对中国进行侵略和干涉的政策，同中国通过和平谈判解决两国之间在台湾地区的争端。究竟走哪一条道路，全看美国如何选择。如果美国硬要走前一条道路，那末，正如陈毅外长在9月20日的声明中所说的，中国人民“必将不惜牺牲，在保卫伟大祖国的神圣旗帜下，为反抗侵略而战，为维护祖国的主权和领土完整而战，为保卫远东和世界的和平而战”。中国政府和人民是愿意通过和平谈判的方式来解决中国和美国之间的国际争端的，这是中国的一贯主张。正因为这个缘故，我们对中美会谈在华沙恢复曾抱着希望。但是，华沙会谈刚刚开始，美国就提出荒谬的“停火”主张，使全世界期待的中美会谈一开始就陷于僵局。如果美国不放弃它的“停火”阴谋，这个僵局就无法打开。由此而引起的一切后果，都必须由美国承担。
