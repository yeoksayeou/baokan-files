Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 16th: Many residents of Damascus have recently visited the Chinese Consulate General here to express their firm support for the Chinese people's struggle to liberate their territory of Taiwan and other coastal islands. They expressed great indignation at the United States' disregard for the repeated warnings of the Chinese government and continued war provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait area.

Residents of the Bustan al-Raqis and Jisr al-Abyad districts of Damascus sent five representatives on September 12 to deliver letters of support for the Chinese people's just struggle to the Chinese Consulate General. Nearly a thousand people signed this two-and-a-half-meter-long letter.

The letter said, "We fully support the heroic struggle of China to liberate its territory of Taiwan and other coastal islands." The letter went on to say: "We also wish to point out to you that this struggle is not only China's struggle, but the struggle of all mankind everywhere to smash and destroy imperialism headed by US imperialism, in order to save the world from a terrible and abominable nightmare."

A letter from the residents of the Muhajireen district of Damascus, one and a half people long and signed by more than 700 people, said: "We—the residents of the Muhajireen district of Damascus—condemn the American aggression against our friend, the people of China, and consider it an aggression against the Arabs. We declare that we will stand by the friendly people who supported us in our struggle against US imperialism in the days when we were severely tested in Port Said, Lebanon, and Jordan."

These days, the Chinese Consulate General has also received telegrams from Damascus and other parts of the Syrian region, expressing heartfelt support for China's struggle to liberate its territory. Some of these telegrams came from residents of the Mazzeh and Zkak al-Saher districts of Damascus, and some from the Homs League for the Protection of Children and Women, doctors and pharmacists in Homs, and trade unions throughout the Syrian region. Some telegrams also requested that their support for the Chinese people be conveyed to Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and the Chinese people.

The Syrian Regional Trade Unions, which held a meeting in Aleppo on September 12, said in a telegram to the Chinese Consul General in Damascus that Arab workers fully support China's just struggle.

According to a report in the Damascus newspaper "Al-Nour" on the 15th, readers and residents from all over the Syrian region sent thousands of telegrams and letters to "Al-Nour" expressing their support for China's heroic struggle against American pirates.

    侵略中国就是侵略阿拉伯人
    叙利亚地区人民热烈支持我国人民的正义斗争
    据新华社大马士革16日电　大马士革的许多居民最近几天陆续到中国驻这里的总领事馆，表示他们坚决支持中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和其它沿海岛屿的斗争。他们对美国不顾中国政府的再三警告继续在台湾海峡地区对中国进行战争挑衅的行为表示极大的愤慨。
    大马士革布斯坦·拉基斯区和吉斯拉勒—阿比亚德区的居民在9月12日派遣了五名代表把他们支持中国人民正义斗争的信件交给了中国总领事馆。这封长达两公尺半的信件上签满了将近一千人的名字。
    这封信说，我们完全支持中国解放自己的领土台湾和其它沿海岛屿的英勇斗争。信中接着说：“我们还愿意向你们指出，这场斗争不仅仅是中国的斗争，而且是全人类在各地粉碎和摧毁以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义，以便把全世界从一场可怖的令人憎恶的恶梦中拯救出来的斗争。”
    大马士革穆哈杰伦区居民的一封有一个半人那么长、有七百多人签字的信件说：“我们——大马士革穆哈杰伦区的居民——谴责美国对我们的朋友人民中国的侵略，并且认为这是对阿拉伯人的侵略。我们宣布：我们将同友好的人民站在一边，他们曾经在我们在塞得港、黎巴嫩和约旦遭到严重考验的日子里，在我们反对美帝国主义的斗争中支持我们。”
    这些天来，中国总领事馆还收到大马士革和叙利亚地区其他各地发来的电报，这些电报表示衷心支持中国解放自己领土的斗争。这些电报有的来自大马士革马兹塔区和泽卡克·萨赫尔区的居民，有的来自荷姆斯保卫儿童妇女联盟、荷姆斯的医生、药剂师以及叙利亚地区各地的工会。有些电报还要求把他们对中国人民的支持转告毛泽东主席、周恩来总理和中国人民。
    9月12日在阿勒颇举行会议的叙利亚地区工会在打给中国驻大马士革总领事的电报中表示，阿拉伯工人完全支持中国的正义斗争。
    据大马士革“光明报”15日报道，叙利亚地区各地读者和居民给“光明报”发了数以千计的电报和信件，表示支持中国反对美国海盗的英勇斗争。
