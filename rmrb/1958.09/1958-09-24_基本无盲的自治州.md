Basically Illiteracy-Free Autonomous Prefecture

    After launching an unprecedented anti-illiteracy campaign, the Guizhou Southeast Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture officially announced on August 20 that it had basically eliminated illiteracy. A total of 519,000 young and middle-aged illiterate people were eliminated in the 16 counties of the prefecture, accounting for 84.6% of the total of 613,000 young and middle-aged illiterate people in the prefecture. The Miao, Dong and other ethnic groups in the mountainous areas have taken a big step forward on the road to marching towards socialist culture and science.

    The anti-illiteracy work in the Guizhou Southeast Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture has progressed rapidly, with good quality and remarkable results, mainly due to the leadership of the Party committee and the full enthusiasm of the farmers of all ethnic groups. The anti-illiteracy headquarters from the county and district to the township and commune levels throughout the prefecture are generally directed by the Party committee secretary. All counties organized an anti-illiteracy team of more than 250,000 people, who went deep into the villages to carry out shock campaigns. At the same time, they trained assistants among the peasant activists who had shed their illiterate hats, and promoted the method of "teaching by relatives and teaching by neighbors" and "teaching by those who know more characters to those who know fewer characters" to carry out shock anti-illiteracy campaigns, so the speed was very fast. From August 4 to 20, within half a month, nine counties including Shibing, Leishan, Tianzhu, Zhenyuan, and Danzhai basically eliminated illiteracy one after another.

    In the anti-illiteracy campaign, all localities adopted the method of promoting both Han literacy and Miao literacy. In addition to organizing existing Miao teachers, students and some cadres who understand Miao language to carry out anti-illiteracy work in Miao-populated areas in Miao language, the autonomous prefecture's ethnic language leading department also adopted short-term shock methods to train a group of Miao anti-illiteracy teachers to invest in this movement.

    基本无盲的自治州
    黔东南苗族侗族自治州掀起一个空前规模的扫盲运动后，于8月20日正式宣布基本实现无盲州。全州十六个县共扫除青壮年文盲五十一万九千多人，占全州青壮年文盲总数六十一万三千多人的84.6％。山区里的苗、侗等族人民在向社会主义文化科学进军的道路上，向前迈进了一大步。
    黔东南苗族侗族自治州的扫盲工作，主要由于党委挂帅，各族农民发挥了冲天干劲，全面突击，因而进展快，质量也好，功效显著。全州各地从县、区到乡、社的扫盲指挥部，一般都是党委书记指挥。各县组织起来共二十五万多人的扫盲队伍，他们一面深入村寨进行突击，一面在摘掉了文盲帽子的农民积极分子中培养助手，同时推广亲教亲、邻教邻，识字多的教识字少的方法进行突击扫盲，因此速度很快。从8月4日到20日的半个月时间内已有施秉、雷山、天柱、镇远、丹寨等九县先后基本扫除了文盲。
    在扫盲中，各地采取汉文扫盲与苗文扫盲并举的方法。全州除组织现有的苗文教师、学生和部分懂得苗文的干部用苗文在苗族聚居区进行扫盲以外，自治州民族语文领导部门并采取短期突击的方式，培训了一批苗文扫盲教师投入这一运动。
