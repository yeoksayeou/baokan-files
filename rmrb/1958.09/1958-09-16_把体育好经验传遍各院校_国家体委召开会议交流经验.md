Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission recently held a Higher Education Institutions Sports Work Experience Exchange Conference in Beijing. Representatives from Hefei Mining Institute, Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering, and Beijing Mining Institute systematically introduced their experiences in the Great Leap Forward in sports work at the meeting. After evaluation at the meeting, Hefei Mining Institute, Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering, Beijing Mining Institute, Shenyang Agricultural College, and Nanjing Aeronautical Institute were selected as national sports red banner institutions. Except for the sick and disabled, 100% of the students at Hefei Mining Institute and Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering have reached the Level One, Level Two, and athlete standards of the Labor and Defense System (same below); 100% of the students at the other three institutions have reached the Level One and athlete standards of the Labor and Defense System.

Before the meeting, Vice Premier He Long received the heads of Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering, Hefei Mining Institute, and Beijing Mining Institute, and encouraged their work. At the close of the meeting, Vice Premier He Long awarded the five institutions red flags inscribed with "National Sports Red Banner Institution" and gave instructions for the meeting.

In just four or five months, these five schools leaped from the original 30%-40% of students reaching the Labor and Defense System standards and 10%-20% reaching the athlete standards to today's achievements. In particular, Shenyang Agricultural College worked hard for eleven days, achieving 100% of students reaching the Level One and athlete standards of the Labor and Defense System from the original 53% and 39% respectively. After the Great Leap Forward in sports, these schools have significantly changed the health conditions of their students. The experiences of these schools prove that vigorously promoting mass sports activities can accelerate the development of sports work; engaging in sports activities not only does not affect work-study programs and production labor, but also, after students universally participate in physical exercise, everyone is full of energy, study with vigor, and demonstrate vigorous enthusiasm in labor. A jingle compiled by students at Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering says: "Walking is powerful and healthy, eating is fragrant and sweet, attending classes is full of energy, and laboring is full of vigor."

These five schools adhered to putting politics in command, party committee leadership, and under the guidance of the Great Leap Forward ideology, achieved unified arrangements for all tasks, resolutely relied on the masses, and not only achieved outstanding results in sports activities, but also excelled in work-study programs, scientific research, and teaching reform, and were valued and praised by the local party committees. The meeting unanimously affirmed the resolute and comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's educational policy of "enabling those who receive education to develop in morality, intelligence, and physical education, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." Higher education institutions' sports work must be under the leadership of the Party, rely on the masses, vigorously promote mass movements, resolutely implement the mass line, adhere to the policy of combining popularization and improvement, and combine sports with production labor and with the arming of the whole people, to serve proletarian politics and national defense.

    把体育好经验传遍各院校
    国家体委召开会议交流经验
    据新华社15日讯　国家体委最近在北京召开了高等学校体育工作经验交流会。合肥矿业学院、西安建筑工程学院和北京矿业学院的代表在会上系统地介绍了体育工作大跃进的经验。会上经过评定，选出合肥矿业学院、西安建筑工程学院、北京矿业学院、沈阳农学院和南京航空学院为全国体育红旗院。合肥矿业学院和西安建筑工程学院学生除病残外（以下同），已百分之一百达到劳卫制一级、二级和等级运动员标准，其他三院百分之一百的学生达到劳卫制一级和等级运动员标准。
    会前，贺龙副总理接见了西安建筑工程学院、合肥矿业学院和北京矿业学院的负责人，鼓励了他们的工作。会议结束时贺龙副总理将写有“全国体育运动红旗院”的五面红旗授予各院，并对会议做了指示。
    这五所学校在短短的四、五个月中，由原来学生达到劳卫制标准的30％—40％，达到等级运动员标准的10％—20％，跃到今天的成绩。特别是沈阳农学院苦干十一天，由原来劳卫制53％、等级运动员39％，达到100％的学生达到劳卫制一级和等级运动员的标准。这几个学校在体育大跃进以后，显著地改变学生健康状况。这些学校的经验证明，大搞群众性体育运动，能够加速体育工作的发展；开展体育运动不仅不影响勤工俭学和生产劳动，并且学生们普遍参加体育锻炼以后，人人精神焕发，学习精力充沛，在劳动中表现出生龙活虎的干劲。西安建筑工程学院学生编的顺口溜说：“走起路来又雄又健，吃起饭来又香又甜，上起课来精神饱满，劳动起来干劲冲天。”
    这五所学校坚持了政治挂帅，党委领导，在全面大跃进的思想指导下，做到各项工作统一安排，坚决依靠群众，不仅体育运动取得优异成绩，而且勤工俭学、科学研究、教学改革等方面都很出色，受到当地党委的重视和表扬。会议一致肯定坚决地全面贯彻毛主席提出的“使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的教育方针，高等学校体育工作必须在党的领导下，依靠群众，大搞群众运动，坚决贯彻群众路线，坚持普及和提高相结合的方针，使体育与生产劳动，体育与全民武装相结合，为无产阶级的政治服务，为国防服务。
