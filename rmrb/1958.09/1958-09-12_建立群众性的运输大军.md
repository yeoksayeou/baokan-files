Establish a Mass Transportation Army
Yu Chunkai, Mayor of Changzhou

	Leap Forward in Industrial Production
	Transportation Must Lead the Way

1958 is a year of great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production. The total industrial output value of Changzhou has leaped again and again. Comparing the second quarter with the first quarter, the number of factories increased by 95.1%; the total industrial output value increased by 59.16%.

The development of industrial production has brought more arduous tasks to the transportation industry. A large amount of raw materials must be transported from other places, and a large number of industrial products must be transported out of the city. Moreover, this year's freight has the characteristics of rapid momentum, tight schedule, wide distribution, and long transportation lines. Therefore, the original transportation capacity has been unable to meet the requirements of the objective situation, and congestion often occurs. Under this situation, although the transportation department has made great efforts, the goods at stations and docks are still piled up like mountains, with steel plates, coal, and ore mixed together. According to the estimation of Changzhou's industrial production plan, 63% of the freight transportation problem will still not be solved in the second half of this year.

It is already very clear that in the great leap forward of industry and agriculture, the transportation industry must also have a great leap forward to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural development. But how to make a great leap forward? Who should rely on to run transportation? What measures should be taken to realize the great leap forward? Is it to rely on a few people in the transportation department and wait to purchase modern transportation tools to increase transportation capacity? Or to implement the policy of the whole party and the whole people running transportation, and make use of all available folk transportation tools as much as possible? Facts have proved that relying solely on professional departments to run the transportation industry cannot adapt to the situation of the great leap forward. The mechanization and modernization of transportation tools cannot be achieved overnight. The only way out is to resolutely implement the central government's policy of the whole party and the whole people running transportation, rely on the masses, and follow the mass line to realize the great leap forward in the transportation industry.

	The Whole Party Takes Action and the Whole People Mobilize

In late June, the enlarged meeting of the CPC Changzhou Municipal Committee made a decision on vigorously developing the iron and steel smelting industry and the whole party and the whole people running the transportation industry. It required that the Party committees of all districts must regard transportation work as an important link in industrial production, grasp it in a unified manner, and resolutely place all transportation departments under the unified leadership of the Party committee. Vigorously carry out mass movements, vigorously carry out technological revolution, mobilize the whole party and the whole people to vigorously run transportation, and immediately start to establish organizations. Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, a leading group for transportation work was established within the Party, and a transportation committee headquarters was established in the administration, with the mayor as the general commander and the minister of finance and trade and the secretary of the transportation Party committee as the deputy general commanders; each district also established a headquarters, with the district mayor as the commander, to command in a unified manner; at the same time, all loading and unloading stations and flatbed cart cooperatives originally led by the city were assigned to the leadership of each district as the backbone of transportation in each district. Each district also established a transportation section (shareholding), under the unified leadership of the district committee, responsible for specific business work. In the process of conveying the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Municipal Party Committee, all systems and districts in the city widely mobilized the masses. Through publicity of the situation and tasks, education with steel as the key link was carried out, calling on the whole party and the whole people to run transportation well, ensure that the marshals are promoted to the ranks, and combine specific ideas to launch debates among the broad masses of cadres and the masses to improve the ideological awareness of the broad masses and solve the incorrect ideas of some cadres and the masses who emphasized difficulties, loved ease and hated labor, and were unwilling to participate in transportation work. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses was even higher, and they signed up to actively participate in the transportation team, forming a climax of the whole people running transportation.

	Thousands of Troops Set Off Together

In less than three days after conveying the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Municipal Party Committee, due to the extensive and in-depth mobilization of the masses, 40,000 people signed up to participate in the transportation team, accounting for one-sixth of the city's population. Including government cadres, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, workers, shop assistants, students, residents, business circles, and religious circles, etc. The city is divided into seven "Socialist Construction Support Brigades" including government cadres, students, business circles, Tianning District, Guanghua District, Zhonglou District, and Qishuyan District. Under the various district brigades, the masses also established resident transportation teams, social welfare transportation stations, flatbed cart joint operation groups, resident volunteer transportation teams, worker family transportation cooperatives, and industrial and mining transportation teams.

On July 2, this mass transportation team, led by the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee and the mayor, marched to the railway station from all directions with red flags, gongs and drums, carrying rakes, baskets, and pushing carts. They used soap boxes, rice washing baskets, flour bags, straw hats, etc. to transport ore. Some were carrying, some were lifting, some were carrying on their backs, and some were holding. Suddenly the freight yard became a battlefield. The major brigades were responsible for the transportation of ore and coal, the professional flatbed cart team was responsible for moving heavy steel parts, and the unloading units also immediately organized loading and unloading troops to rush to unload the goods. Because the leaders took the lead, the masses were fully mobilized, and publicity and mobilization work was strengthened in a timely manner, the morale of the transportation team was boosted and their fighting spirit was high. They transported goods in the scorching heat during the day and fought through the night, some even working all night. Some wrote mobilization poems while working, and some sang while transporting: "Remember the general line in your heart, pick up the heavy burden and move forward bravely; think of the steel city in your heart, don't want to rest even if the work is tired; think of catching up with the US and the UK in your heart, the more you work in transportation, the more energetic you become." The car drivers of the Nanjing troops who supported the city's transportation proposed: "Fight hard for three days and nights to ensure that the station is empty." Monks and nuns also expressed that they would use the determination of Tang Monk to learn the scriptures and the vigor of Lu Zhishen to pull the willow tree upside down to move the ore. Because the masses were very enthusiastic, the transportation team dispatched 100,000 people in five days and five nights, transported 20,000 tons of materials, which turned the transportation to normal and enabled the factories and construction units to obtain the required materials in time.

After this battle, several more surprise attacks were organized to transport 4,000 tons of coke and coal, and a freight yard covering an area of ​​250 mu and a freight line of 3,025 meters long were newly built. The project originally scheduled to be completed in 100 days was finally shortened to 28 days. In order to adapt to the needs of the new freight line, the masses were mobilized to build two bridges and a highway of 4,253 meters long. A mass transportation team has been formed.

Through the whole party and the whole people running transportation, a broad mass transportation team has been initially formed. In addition to professional porters responsible for handling heavier goods and doing more technically demanding handling work, there are now four types of mass transportation organizations in the city:

The first is the transportation brigade of students, government cadres, and business circles. Each brigade has a fixed number of people but not fixed people. For example, 2,500 high school students, 500 business people, and 200 government cadres are dispatched in rotation by each unit, and they arrive whenever they are called. Their main task is to carry out surprise transportation work in municipal units (in fact, it is not limited to transportation). Some are paid, and some are volunteer labor. The wages obtained are handled uniformly by the unit, mainly for purchasing tools, running steel and other public undertakings.

The second is the industry transportation team. There are two in Guanghua District. One is organized by small vendors, who generally do their own business for half a day and transportation work for half a day; the other is organized by handicraft workers, whose task is to smelt steel, and transportation is part of their entire task. They engage in iron smelting themselves and need to transport ore, coke, and other materials themselves. Therefore, they are both steel production teams and transportation teams.

The third is the factory enterprise transportation team. It is mainly responsible for all or part of the loading, unloading, and transportation tasks of the factory. This is an important transportation force. Many small factories can contract it themselves. Large factories have heavier transportation tasks. In addition to mobilizing workers to participate in transportation, they need to organize a part of the professional transportation force and provide support from outside the factory. Factory enterprise transportation teams generally adopt the method of workers doing one or two hours of transportation work after get off work. Some factories implement a four-shift system, with three shifts engaged in production and one shift specifically engaged in transportation or other work. This approach can basically eliminate the phenomenon that factory production workers do not care about transportation.

The fourth is the resident transportation team established by each district with the resident labor production cooperative as the unit. The experience of the Xinfeng Street Resident Labor Production Cooperative in Tianning District is very good. These experiences are mainly: 1. Regularly carry out political and ideological education to the team members, so that they can recognize the situation and clarify the significance and purpose of participating in the transportation team; 2. The transportation team is composed of stronger labor force in the residents and is directly led by the residents committee, with the director or standing committee member of the residents committee serving as the captain; 3. The transportation team focuses on transportation tasks, and can contact nearby enterprises and docks to sign contracts, or accept other tasks, but team members are not allowed to solicit business individually; 4. Reasonably arrange the team's production and life, especially to find ways to reduce women's housework, such as running canteens and nurseries, etc., so that they can get rid of the burden of housework; 5. The individual income of transportation team members should be close to the wage level of local private factory workers, generally not exceeding 30 yuan per month, and a part of the handling fee should be used as public accumulation to run production and construction and collective welfare undertakings. The income of transportation team cadres should not exceed the average income of team members; 6. The transportation tools are in principle self-provided.

There are now 69 resident transportation teams in Changzhou, with a total of 1,089 transportation team members. These mass transportation teams undertook the loading and unloading of 200,000 tons of materials in July. Although these organizational forms created by the masses are only prototypes and have not been completely consolidated, and need to be further investigated, consolidated and improved in the future, it should be affirmed that their direction is correct and conforms to the spirit of the whole party and the whole people running transportation. At present, these transportation teams are developing towards tooling, institutionalization, regularization, collectivization, and massization.

	Preliminary Achievements and Experience

Since the city has implemented the policy of the whole party and the whole people running transportation, the transportation department has carried out technological revolution, which has greatly increased transportation and loading and unloading capacity, and a great leap forward situation has emerged in the transportation industry, changing the past phenomenon of vehicles and ships waiting to be loaded and unloaded. The transportation volume in July increased by 63.5% compared with June, which is 3.18 times that of the same period last year; the loading and unloading volume increased by 60% compared with June, which is 4.89 times that of the same period last year. This guarantees the needs of the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production.

In the process of practice, we deeply realize that the whole party and the whole people running transportation is the only way out and basic approach to solve the problem of insufficient transportation capacity in the current great leap forward situation. It is also the basic road for the transportation industry to implement the general line. Only in this way can the strength of the broad masses be organized, the huge potential be tapped, and all indigenous methods be used, like "ants moving house", to make the transportation cause achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.

    建立群众性的运输大军
    常州市市长　于春开
    工业生产突飞猛进
    交通运输必须先行
    1958年是我国工农业生产大跃进的一年。常州市工业生产总值一跃再跃，以二季度与一季度比较，工厂数目增加了95.1％；工业生产总值增长了59.16％。
    工业生产的发展给交通运输事业带来了更加繁重的任务。大量的原材料要从外地运来，大量的工业产品要从本市运出。而且今年的货运有来势猛、时间紧、分布面广、运输线长等特点，因而原来的运输能力已经不能适应客观形势的要求，经常发生阻塞现象。在这种形势下，交通运输部门虽然作了很大的努力，但车站、码头上的货物还是一时堆积如山，钢板、煤炭、矿石混杂在一起。根据常州市工业生产计划推算，今年下半年还有63％的货物运输问题无法解决。
    事情已经很清楚，在工农业大跃进中，交通运输事业也必须来个大跃进，以适应工农业发展的需要。但是究竟怎样大跃进？依靠谁来办交通？采取什么办法来实现大跃进？是依靠交通运输部门的少数人，等待购买现代化的交通工具来增加运输能力呢？还是贯彻全党全民办交通的方针，并尽可能利用现有的一切可以利用的民间运输工具？事实证明，单纯依靠专业部门来办交通运输事业是不能适应大跃进的形势的。交通运输工具的机械化、现代化也不是一朝一夕所能办到的。唯一的出路，只有坚决贯彻中央关于全党全民办交通的方针，依靠群众、走群众路线来实现交通运输事业的大跃进。
    全党动手全民动员
    6月下旬，中共常州市委扩大会议作出关于大办钢铁冶炼工业和全党全民办交通运输事业的决定，要求各区党委必须把交通工作作为工业生产的一个重要环节，统一抓起来，并将各个交通运输部门坚决放在党委的统一领导下面，大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命，动员全党全民大办交通，并立即着手成立组织。在市委统一领导下，党内成立运输工作领导小组，行政上成立运输委员会指挥部，由市长担任总指挥，财贸部长、交通党委书记担任副总指挥；各区也成立指挥部，由区长担任指挥，统一指挥；同时又将原由市领导的各装卸站、板车合作社划归各区领导，作为各区的运输骨干力量。各区还建立交通科（股），在区委统一领导下，负责具体业务工作。全市各系统、各区在传达市委扩大会议的过程中，都广泛发动了群众，通过形势和任务宣传，进行以钢为纲的教育，号召全党全民办好交通，保证元帅升帐，并结合具体思想，在广大干部和群众中展开辩论，提高了广大群众的思想觉悟，解决了部分干部和群众强调困难、好逸恶劳、不愿意参加搬运工作等不正确的思想，因而群众的积极性更加高涨，纷纷报名踊跃参加运输队，形成了全民办交通的高潮。
    千军万马一齐出动
    在传达市委扩大会议精神以后的不到三天中，由于广泛深入地发动了群众，报名参加运输队的达四万人，占本市人口的六分之一。其中包括机关干部、解放军官兵、工人、店员、学生、居民、工商界、宗教界等。全市划分为机关干部、学生、工商界、天宁区、广化区、钟楼区、戚墅堰区等七个“社会主义建设支援大队”。在各区大队下，群众还建立了居民运输队、社会福利运输站、板车联营组、居民义务运输队、工人家属运输合作社、工矿运输队等。
    7月2日，这支群众运输队伍在市委书记和市长带领下，各路大军高举红旗，敲起锣鼓，扛着钉耙，挑着箩筐，推着小车，从四面八方浩浩荡荡开到火车站。他们用肥皂箱、淘米箩、面粉袋、草帽等等装运矿石，有的挑，有的抬，有的背，有的捧，顿时货场变成了战场。各大队分头负责矿石、煤炭的运输，专业板车队负责搬运钢铁重件，各卸货单位也立即组织装卸大军抢卸货物。由于各领导带头，充分发动群众，并且及时加强宣传鼓动工作，因此运输队士气振作、斗志昂扬。他们白天冒着酷暑运输，晚上挑灯夜战，有些人甚至通宵达旦。他们有的一面劳动一面写鼓动诗，有的一边运输一边唱歌：“心中想起总路线，挑起重担勇向前；心中想起钢铁城，工作虽累不想息；心中想起赶美英，运输越干越有劲。”南京部队支援本市运输的汽车司机提出：“苦战三昼夜，保证车站出空”。和尚、尼姑也表示要以唐僧取经的决心和鲁智深倒拔垂杨柳的干劲来搬运矿石。由于群众干劲很大，五天五夜出动了运输队十万人次，运走了两万吨物资，使运输转向正常，使工厂和基建单位及时获得了需要的物资。
    这场战斗以后，又组织了几次突击战，运输了焦炭、煤炭四千吨，新建了占地二百五十亩的货场和三千零二十五公尺长的货运线，原定一百天完成的工程终于缩短在二十八天内完成。为了适应新货运线的需要，又发动群众修造了两座桥梁和长达四千二百五十三公尺的公路。一支群众性的运输队伍已经形成
    通过全党全民办交通，广大群众性的运输队伍已经初步形成。全市除专业的搬运工人负责搬运比较笨重的货物和做技术性较强的搬运工作外，又出现了四种群众性的运输组织：
    第一种是学生、机关干部、工商界的运输大队。各大队固定人数不固定人。如高中学生两千五百人，工商界五百人，机关干部两百人，由各单位轮流调派，随调随到。他们的任务主要是到市属单位搞突击运输工作（事实不仅限于运输），有的付给工资，有的义务劳动。所得工资由本单位统一处理，主要用于购买工具，办钢铁及其他公共事业。
    第二种是行业运输队，广化区有两个，一个是由小商小贩组织起来的，一般是半天干本行，半天做运输工作；另一个是由手工业工人组织起来的，他们的任务是炼钢铁，运输是他们整个任务的一部分。他们自己搞炼铁，需要自己运输矿石、焦炭等物资，因此既是钢铁生产队，又是运输队。
    第三种是工厂企业运输队。主要负责本厂本企业的全部或一部分装卸、运输任务。这是一支重要的运输力量。许多小厂可以自己包干。大厂运输任务较重，除发动工人参加运输外，要组织一部分专业运输力量并由厂外支援。工厂企业运输队，一般都采取工人下班后做一二小时运输工作的办法。有的厂实行四班制，三班搞生产，一班专门做运输工作或其他工作。用这种做法可以基本上消除工厂生产工人不关心交通运输的现象。
    第四种是各区以居民劳动生产合作社为单位建立的居民运输队。天宁区新丰街居民劳动生产合作社的经验很好。这些经验主要是：1、经常向队员进行政治思想教育，使他们认清形势，明确参加运输队的意义和目的；2、运输队由居民中较强的劳动力组成，由居民委员会直接领导，居委主任或常委担任队长；3、运输队以运输任务为主，可与就近企业、码头接洽签订合同，也可以接受其他任务，但队员个人不得招揽业务；4、合理安排队的生产和生活，特别是要设法减轻妇女的家务劳动，如办食堂和托儿所等，使她们摆脱家务的牵累；5、运输队员个人的收入应该与当地民办工厂工人的工资水平相近，一般以每月不超过三十元为原则，从搬运力资中提出一部分作为公共积累，兴办生产建设和集体福利事业，运输队干部的收入以不超过队员的平均收入为限；6、运输工具原则上自备。
    现在常州市有六十九个居民运输队，共计一千零八十九个运输队员。这些群众性的运输队，在7月份曾经担任了二十万吨物资的装卸任务。这些群众创造出来的组织形式，虽然还只是个雏型，还没有完全巩固，还有待于今后进一步去考察巩固提高，但应肯定它们的方向是正确的，是符合于全党全民办交通的精神的。目前这些运输队正在朝着工具化、制度化、经常化、集体化、群众化的方向发展。
    初步成绩和体会
    本市由于贯彻了全党全民办交通的方针，交通运输部门开展了技术革命，因而大大增加了运输、装卸能力，出现了交通运输事业大跃进的局面，改变了过去那种车辆船只待装待卸的现象。7月份的运输量比6月份增加了63.5％，为去年同期的三点一八倍；装卸量比6月份增加60％，为去年同期的四点八九倍。这就保证了工农业生产飞跃发展的需要。
    在实践过程中，我们深深地体会到，全党全民办交通是当前解决大跃进形势中运输能力不足的唯一出路和基本途径，也是交通运输事业贯彻总路线的基本道路，只有这样才能把广大群众的力量组织起来，把巨大的潜力挖掘出来，用一切土办法，像“蚂蚁搬家”一样，使运输事业做到多快好省。
