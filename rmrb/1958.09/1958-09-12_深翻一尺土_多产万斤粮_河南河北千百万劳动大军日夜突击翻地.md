　　Deeply Ploughing One Foot of Soil, Produces Ten Thousand Catties of Grain
　　Henan and Hebei's Millions of Laborers Assault Ploughing Day and Night

　　(By our dispatch) Recently, more than 1,300 people's communes in Henan Province have drawn millions of laborers, established many specialized teams, and are eating and living in the fields, engaging in deep ploughing of the land day and night, determined to pass the first hurdle of wheat sowing well.

　　At present, nearly seven million mu of the province's eight million mu of fallow land has been deeply ploughed. According to statistics from Shangqiu Special District on September 3, the district has deeply ploughed 1,988,900 mu, with a daily progress of 390,000 mu.

　　In the deep ploughing movement, the masses' enthusiasm is extraordinarily high. Xia邑county, which achieved an average wheat yield of 518 catties per mu this year, attaches special importance to deep ploughing. They mobilized 200,000 laborers, all organized in military actions, forming regiments, battalions, and companies, dividing into more than 60 large battlefields, and launching a day and night assault on ploughing the land throughout the county with the spirit of the Huaihai Campaign.

　　At present, the ploughing methods used in various places are roughly as follows: First, deep ploughing with ploughs. Minquan uses this method to deep plough about two chi. Yucheng modified the old-style plough into a deep plough, installing a moldboard on the plough holder. One pair of livestock can plough three mu of land per day, with a depth of one chi two cun; installing three small blades on the old-style plough holder, with a depth of more than one chi one cun, and one pair of livestock can plough two and a half mu per day. Second, blasting ploughing method. Shangqiu, Zhecheng, Yongcheng, Xia邑 and other counties all adopted this method. Shangqiu County used 15 catties of self-made explosives, buried five chi deep, which can blast two fen of land to a depth of six chi. This method also has the effect of killing insects and increasing soil fertility. Third, plough first and then turn, turn and then plough, combining manual deep ploughing with deep ploughing. This method is fast and deep. Yucheng County's "six ploughs, two arches and one dig" method can plough more than eight mu a day with four pairs of livestock, with a depth of one chi five cun to one chi eight cun. Fourth, manual deep ploughing. This method has high quality but is slower. Fifth, tandem ploughing for deep ploughing, with a depth of more than one chi. The main advantage is speed and efficiency. The eight-cun step plough modified in Shangqiu County can plough five mu of land a day to a depth of two chi after being equipped with ball bearings, increasing efficiency by more than three times.

　　(By our dispatch) In the high tide of the movement to establish people's communes, Hebei Province is rushing to manufacture and modify deep ploughing farm tools while launching a concentrated deep ploughing campaign. As of the end of August, the province's seven special districts and Tianjin City have promoted more than 620,600 various deep ploughing ploughs, hoes and other farm tools, and more than 84,000 close-planting seeders; 1,861,800 mu of land has been deeply ploughed. Among them, more than 1,412,000 mu were ploughed more than one and a half chi deep, and more than 143,000 mu were ploughed more than three chi deep. These deeply ploughed lands are mostly stubble land (wheat stubble land) and early autumn crop land. The three special districts of Handan, Shijiazhuang in the south and Baoding in the central region started earlier and progressed faster, and the special districts of Tangshan and Zhangjiakou in the north have also begun to launch a concentrated deep ploughing campaign.

　　Generally, all parts of Hebei Province attach great importance to deep ploughing, and have achieved the leadership of the secretary, the mobilization of the whole party and the whole people, and established deep ploughing headquarters at all levels from the county to the commune. Most agricultural cooperatives and people's communes have organized specialized deep ploughing teams and groups. The people's commune militia production combat regiments, which have already implemented the integration of labor and military affairs, are the shock troops for deep ploughing. At the same time, various places have also organized communist large-scale cooperation.

### 深翻一尺土　多产万斤粮  河南河北千百万劳动大军日夜突击翻地

    深翻一尺土　多产万斤粮
    河南河北千百万劳动大军日夜突击翻地
    本报讯　河南省农村一千三百多个人民公社最近抽出数以百万计的劳动大军，成立许多专业队，吃、住在田间，日夜大搞深翻土地，决心过好小麦播种第一关。
    现在，全省八百多万亩晒垡地已深翻了近七百万亩。商丘专区9月3日统计，全区已深翻地一百九十八万八千九百亩，日进度达到三十九万亩。
    在深翻地运动中，群众情绪异常高涨。今年获得全县小麦平均亩产五百十八斤的夏邑县，对深翻土地特别重视，他们动员二十万劳力，全部以军事化行动，组织成团、营、连，划分六十多个大战场，以淮海战役的劲头，在全县范围内日夜突击翻地。
    目前各地采用的翻地办法大体有以下几种：一，深翻犁翻地。民权用这个办法深翻二尺左右。虞城把旧式犁改成深耕犁，在犁托上安一个铧，一犋牲口一天耕三亩地，深度达到一尺二寸；旧式犁托上安三个小刀，深度达到一尺一寸多，一犋牲口每天耕二亩半。二，爆破翻地法。商丘、柘城、永城、夏邑等县都采用这个办法。商丘县用自己配制的炸药十五斤，深埋五尺，可炸地二分，深度六尺。这种办法并有杀虫、增加土地肥力的效能。三，先犁后翻，翻后再犁，人工深翻与深犁相结合。这种办法翻得快，翻得深。虞城县采用的“六犁两拱再一刨”的方法，四犋牲口一天可翻八亩多，深度达到一尺五寸到一尺八寸。四，人工深翻。这种办法质量高，但效率较慢。五，套犁深翻，深度可达一尺以上，主要好处是速度快，效率高。商丘县改制的八寸步犁，装上滚珠轴承后，一天可犁五亩地，深度二尺，提高效率三倍以上。
    本报讯　河北省在建立人民公社运动的高潮中，正一边赶制和改制深翻农具，一边突击深翻地。截至8月底，全省七个专区和天津市，已推广各种深耕犁、锨等农具六十二万零六百多件，密植耧八万四千多件；深翻地一百八十六万一千八百多亩。其中深翻一尺半以上的一百四十一万二千多亩，深翻达三尺以上的十四万三千多亩。这些深翻的土地，大都是晒茬地（留麦地）和早秋作物地。南部邯郸、石家庄和中部的保定三个专区，开始较早，进度较快，北部唐山、张家口等专区也已开始突击深翻地。
    河北省各地对深翻地工作一般都很重视，都作到了书记挂帅，全党全民动员，并且从县到社层层建立了深翻地指挥部。各农业社和人民公社大部都组织了深翻地专业队、组，已经实行劳武结合的人民公社民兵生产战斗团，是深翻地的突击大军。同时，各地还组织了共产主义大协作。
