　　Aim at the Current Target
　　Wu Lü
    The principle that the technical revolution must be combined with solving key problems in current production is the same as a shooter aiming their gun at the target. If you shoot without aiming at the center of the bullseye – the ten ring – it is difficult to hope for a direct hit, and there is even the possibility of completely missing the target. Every achievement in the technical revolution can promote the development of production, and we should warmly welcome them all; however, if the technical revolution is not combined with solving key problems in current production, it will have great limitations on the development of production.

    The technical revolution is the most fundamental measure to improve labor productivity and develop social production. What is the technical revolution revolutionizing? It is revolutionizing the key links that hinder the improvement of labor productivity and hinder the development of production, using new technical methods to solve these key problems in production, and raising labor productivity and social production to a new level. In the past few months, it is precisely because the technical revolution has been combined with solving the key problems in current production that, in many enterprises, the technical revolution and the production leap forward have taken off together like "birds flying wing to wing": propose leap forward targets, identify key production issues, launch a technical revolution to solve key production issues, and achieve leap forward targets; propose new leap forward targets, identify new key production issues, and then launch a technical revolution to solve key production issues, and achieve new leap forward targets.

    However, a different situation has emerged in some enterprises. Although they have also launched a technical revolution, and there are many technical revolution proposals, new工艺 methods, and new products representing new levels of production technology, their production plans have not been completed well. One of the reasons is that the technical revolution has not been combined with solving the key problems in current production. If key problems cannot be solved, the completion of production plans will inevitably be affected.

    Completing the state plan is the top political task of the entire party and the entire people, and combining the technical revolution with solving the current key production problems is an important guarantee for completing the state plan. Of course, this does not mean that we should exclude technical revolution proposals that do not solve key production problems. All technical revolution proposals, as long as they are conducive to the development of production, no matter how big or small, should be welcomed, encouraged, and helped to be realized. But the leadership must grasp the center, aim at the current target, and concentrate the wisdom of the masses to solve the key problems in current production. Now, more and more enterprises have noticed this problem, and the news from Taiyuan City published in this newspaper today is just one example. For those comrades who have not yet paid attention to combining the technical revolution with solving the key problems in current production, we should remind them: Aim at the current target and solve the key problems in production.

    Of course, in addition to aiming at the current target and solving key production problems, the technical revolution also has far-reaching goals: to achieve mechanization and electrification, and to climb to the peak of world science and technology, and so on. It goes without saying that while aiming the technical revolution at current production key issues, we must not relax our research on cutting-edge technologies.

　　瞄准当前目标
　　吴滤
    技术革命要同解决当前生产中的关键问题结合起来，这个道理正同射手的枪口要瞄准目标一样。射击而不以环靶的中心——十环为目标，固然难有正中十环的希望，但也有根本不能中靶的可能。技术革命中的每一项成就，虽然都能推动生产的发展，都是我们应该热忱欢迎的；但是，如果技术革命不同解决当前生产中的关键问题结合起来，那就对于发展生产有着很大的局限性了。
    技术革命是提高劳动生产率，发展社会生产的最根本的措施。技术革命，革谁的命呢？就是革那些障碍劳动生产率提高，障碍生产发展的关键环节的命，用新的技术方法去解决这些生产中的关键问题，把劳动生产率和社会生产提高到一个新的水平。几个月来，正是由于把技术革命同解决当前生产中的关键问题结合起来，在许多企业里，技术革命同生产跃进像“比翼鸟”一样地展翅齐飞：提出跃进指标，找出生产关键，发动技术革命解决生产关键，实现跃进指标；提出新的跃进指标，找出新的生产关键，再发动技术革命解决生产关键，实现新的跃进指标。
    然而，也有些企业里出现了另外一种情况。在他们那里技术革命虽然也搞起来了，技术革命的倡议、新的工艺方法、代表新的生产技术水平的新产品等等，都有不少，可是生产计划却完成得并不好。原因之一就是技术革命没有同解决当前生产中的关键问题结合起来。关键问题不能解决，生产计划的完成自必受到影响。
    完成国家计划是当前全党全民的头等政治任务，把技术革命同解决当前的生产关键问题结合起来，则是完成国家计划的重要保证。当然，这丝毫也不意味着要去排斥那些不是解决生产关键问题的技术革命的倡议。一切技术革命的倡议，只要有助于生产的发展，无分巨细，都要去欢迎、鼓励，帮助倡议者付诸实现。但是领导一定要抓住中心，瞄准当前的目标，把群众的智慧集中起来解决当前生产的关键问题。现在，已经有越来越多的企业注意到这个问题，今天本报发表的太原市的新闻，不过是其中的一个例子。对于那些还没有注意把技术革命同解决当前生产关键问题结合起来的同志，就应该提醒一句：瞄准当前目标，解决生产关键问题。
    当然，技术革命除了瞄准当前目标，解决生产关键问题之外，也还有远大的目标：实现机械化、电气化，攀上世界科学技术的高峰等等。把技术革命的目标对准当前生产关键，同时也不要放松对尖端技术的研究，那是不必再讲的。
