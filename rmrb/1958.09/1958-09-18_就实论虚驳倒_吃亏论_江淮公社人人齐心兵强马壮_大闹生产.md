    Refuting the "Suffering Losses" Argument by Speaking of Reality
    Jianghuai Commune United as One, Strong Soldiers and Sturdy Horses, Engaging in Production on a Grand Scale
    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Fú Jūn reports: In the process of establishing the Jianghuai People's Commune in the suburbs of Hefei City, Anhui Province, the commune used the abstract to lead the concrete, conducting extensive and in-depth communist education through large-scale debates, overcoming the departmentalism of "the rich not bringing the poor, the strong not bringing the weak," and carrying out large-scale communist collaboration, promoting a leap forward in production.
    The Jianghuai People's Commune was jointly established by the original Shuguang, Yangguang, and Guangming agricultural cooperatives of Desheng Township in the suburbs of Hefei City, and the Jianghuai, Feinan, Dajing, and Jiaotong agricultural cooperatives of Ershilibu Township in the original Feixi County. Before the merger to form the commune, the seven agricultural cooperatives differed in production and economy. The Shuguang, Yangguang, and Guangming cooperatives were closer to the urban area of Hefei, had better production, more labor, and more livestock. Last year, their grain yield per mu was more than 600 jin. The accumulated public property of the Shuguang cooperative averaged 300 yuan per household, while Yangguang and Guangming cooperatives averaged 550 yuan per household. The Jianghuai and Feinan cooperatives were also relatively wealthy, with a grain yield of 450 jin per mu last year, and accumulated public property averaging 200 yuan per household. The Dajing and Jiaotong cooperatives had a weak production base, less public accumulation, less livestock, and poor water conservancy conditions. Last year, their grain yield was only 300 jin per mu, and accumulated public property averaged only 90 yuan per household.
    When the idea of establishing people's communes was first proposed, the masses were elated and enthusiastically supported it. Every day, members of various cooperatives sent in applications and letters of determination one after another, from morning till night. However, when discussing how to run the commune, new contradictions arose. On the one hand, the vast majority of members and cadres hoped to merge the seven small cooperatives based on water conservancy conditions and the needs of production development to establish people's communes. On the other hand, a small number of members and cadres in the original Shuguang, Yangguang, Guangming, Jianghuai and other cooperatives with more public accumulation began to engage in departmentalism. They were unwilling to merge with the Dajing and Jiaotong cooperatives, which had less public accumulation. Among these few members, the rich middle peasants clamored the loudest. They hoped to merge the several cooperatives with more public accumulation together and not include the Dajing, Jiaotong and other cooperatives with less public accumulation. Even Zhou Xian'ai, the director of the Jianghuai Agricultural Cooperative, said: "If we are to merge, we should merge with Yangguang, Shuguang, and Guangming, not with Dajing and Jiaotong."
    Based on the above situation, the Jianghuai People's Commune Preparatory Committee first focused on ideology, and then solved specific problems. The Preparatory Committee decided to conduct a broad and in-depth communist education in various cooperatives through debates. The main topics of the debate were: "Why should we establish people's communes?" "How should we establish people's communes?" "What is communist ideology? Is it right for the rich not to bring the poor, and the strong not to bring the weak?" This large-scale debate was a fierce battle between communism and departmentalism. In the debate, three accounts were specifically calculated: First, recalling the past. After the accounting, it was unanimously agreed that the reason why the wealthy cooperatives were wealthy was not due to the isolated efforts of a few people, but due to the resolute pursuit of the socialist road under the leadership of the Party, the result of strong support from the state, and the result of mutual large-scale collaboration. For example, the Shuguang, Yangguang, and Guangming cooperatives were able to develop faster and become richer because they were closer to the urban area and received more support and collaboration from the people in the urban area, with more fertilizer, more funds, and more machinery. For example, since the Jianghuai cooperative was established as an advanced cooperative, the state has successively provided the cooperative with various long-term and short-term loans totaling about 100,000 yuan in the past three years. With the strong support of the state, the cooperative built a small reservoir, installed cement culverts in most ponds, built a grain processing plant, and built more than 50 pigsties, which greatly developed agricultural and industrial production. The conclusion of the debate was that if it were not for the firm pursuit of the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party, without state support, and without mutual collaboration, it would not be possible to become wealthy. Second, comparing the present. Mainly, each other looked for favorable and unfavorable conditions for developing production in each cooperative, and each cooperative generally carried out accounting and ranking. For example, although the Shuguang, Yangguang, and Guangming cooperatives had more public accumulation and better production conditions, they had less land, averaging only nine fen and one li per person, and living conditions were more difficult. Although the Dajing and Jiaotong cooperatives had less public accumulation and poorer production conditions, they had more land, averaging 2.3 mu per person, and the land had great production potential, and the members were enthusiastic. As long as there was sufficient funding and more fertilizer, barren land could be transformed in one year, and production could not only catch up with the Shuguang, Yangguang, and Guangming cooperatives, but also possibly surpass them. After accounting and debating, everyone realized that the so-called rich and poor, strong and weak cooperatives were not absolute, but relative. There was poverty in wealth, wealth in poverty, weakness in strength, and strength in weakness. Moreover, the so-called rich cooperative, poor cooperative, strong cooperative, and weak cooperative were not permanently unchanged. As long as they went all out, fully collaborated, and jointly established large-scale communes, poor and weak cooperatives would soon change. Third, looking at the future. Mainly, the members were educated in communism using long-term planning. After the Jianghuai People's Commune is built, next year's grain production plan will be doubled or tripled on the basis of this year's bumper harvest. In terms of water conservancy, the Jianghuai People's Commune plans to make all 28,000 mu of paddy fields and wheat fields in the whole commune achieve self-flowing irrigation, so that a bumper harvest can be guaranteed even if it does not rain for a year. These beautiful visions strongly moved the hearts of the members. Everyone realized that the so-called rich cooperative now is only a small wealth, and it is not rich at all compared with the future. Only by organizing people's communes can we become richer. Such accounting and debate made the ideology more and more transparent, and the accounts became more and more in-depth. The iron-clad facts refuted the "suffering losses" argument of a few people. Everyone unanimously believed that "the rich not bringing the poor, and the strong not bringing the weak" was wrong, and it was necessary to eliminate departmentalism, unite and establish people's communes. With more people, more money, larger scale, and greater strength, we can accomplish great things. Because of the victory over departmentalism, the Jianghuai People's Commune smoothly convened a member representative conference on August 8 and formally announced its establishment. The original seven small cooperatives have been formed into seven production brigades.
    Through mass debates, communist ideology has been greatly promoted, and the problems existing in the construction of the commune have been readily solved. Now the whole commune is carrying out communist collaboration, and a new upsurge has appeared in production. Recently, the Shuguang, Yangguang, Guangming, and Jianghuai teams have taken the initiative to draw out 5,600 yuan to support the Dajing and Jiaotong teams to buy seeds, buy fertilizers, and set up indigenous fertilizer plants. The Shuguang, Yangguang, and Guangming teams have transferred 72,300 jin of granular fertilizer and 35 head of cattle to support the Dajing and Jiaotong teams. More than 500 mu of rice in the Feinan team fell down and was about to germinate, urgently needing to be harvested, but there was a shortage of labor. The other six teams immediately transferred more than 600 people to help with the rush harvest, which was completed in one day and one night, so that more than 500 mu of rice was not damaged. The members saw that the commune had exerted great power, and their production enthusiasm was even greater. Many members said: "The commune is really good, with mutual collaboration, even great difficulties can be overcome."

    就实论虚驳倒“吃亏论”
    江淮公社人人齐心兵强马壮　大闹生产
    本报讯　记者茀君报道：安徽省合肥市郊区江淮人民公社在建社过程中以虚带实，通过大辩论的方式进行广泛的、深入的共产主义教育，战胜了“富不带贫、强不带弱”的本位主义，开展了大规模的共产主义大协作，推动生产飞跃前进。
    江淮人民公社是由原合肥市郊区德胜乡的曙光、仰光、光明三个农业社和原肥西县二十里埠乡的江淮、肥南、大井、交通四个农业社联合办成的。合并办社前的七个农业社在生产上和经济上互有高低。曙光、仰光、光明三个社靠合肥市区较近，生产较好，劳动力多，牲畜多，去年粮食亩产是六百多斤。积累的公共财产曙光社平均每户有三百元，仰光和光明两个社平均每户达五百五十元。江淮和肥南两个社也比较富裕，去年粮食亩产是四百五十斤，积累的公共财产平均每户有二百元。大井和交通两个社生产基础薄弱，公共积累较少，牲畜少，水利条件差，去年粮食亩产只有三百斤，积累的公共财产平均每户只有九十元。
    当开始提出办人民公社时，群众都欢欣鼓舞，热烈拥护，各个社每天从早到晚，递送申请书和决心书的社员络绎不断。但是当讨论到如何办社时，却发生新的矛盾。一方面是绝大多数社员和干部希望根据水利情况和生产发展需要把七个小社合并起来，办人民公社；另一方面，原来公共积累比较多的曙光、仰光、光明、江淮等社有少数社员和干部却闹起本位主义来了。他们不愿和公共积累较少的大井、交通两个社合并。在这些少数社员中富裕中农叫嚷的最厉害，他们希望把几个公共积累较多的社并在一起，不带大井、交通等公共积累较少的社。甚至江淮农业社的主任周先爱也说：“要并我们和仰光、曙光、光明合并，不能和大井、交通合并。”
    根据以上情况，江淮人民公社筹委会首先抓思想，然后再解决具体问题。筹委会决定通过辩论的方式，在各个社进行一次广泛深入的共产主义教育。辩论的主要题目是：“为什么要办人民公社？”“怎样办人民公社？”“什么叫共产主义思想？富不带穷、强不带弱对不对？”这次大辩论，共产主义和本位主义进行了一场恶战。在辩论中具体算了三笔账：第一，回忆过去。经过算账，一致认为富社所以富，并不是由于少数人的孤军作战，而是由于在党的领导下坚决走社会主义道路的结果，是由于国家大力支持的结果，是由于互相大协作的结果。例如曙光、仰光、光明等社，就是因为靠市区较近，得到市区人民较多的支持和协作，肥料多，资金多，机器多，所以生产发展较快，比较富裕。又如江淮社自从成立高级社以后，三年来国家先后贷给这个社的各种长期短期贷款达十万元左右。在国家的大力支持下，这个社兴建一座小水库，大部分塘都安上水泥涵管，兴建一座粮食加工厂，盖了五十多间猪舍，这样才大大发展了农业和工业生产。辩论的结论是，如果不是在共产党领导下坚决走社会主义道路，没有国家支持，没有互相之间的协作，就不可能富裕。第二，比比现在。主要互相找各个社发展生产上的有利条件和不利条件，各个社都普遍进行了算账排队，如曙光、仰光、光明等社虽然公共积累较多，生产条件较好，但是土地较少，每人平均只有九分一厘，而且居住条件比较困难。大井、交通等社虽然公共积累较少，生产条件较差，但是土地多，平均每人有二亩三分，而且土地生产潜力大，社员干劲大，只要资金足，多上肥料，瘦田一年就能改过来，生产上不仅可以赶上曙光、仰光、光明等社，而且可能超过。经过算账辩论以后，大家认识到，各个社所谓富穷强弱不是绝对的，而是相对的，富中有穷，穷中有富，强中有弱，弱中有强。而且所谓富社、穷社、强社、弱社，也不是永久不变的，只要鼓足干劲，全面协作，联合办起规模大的公社来，穷社、弱社很快就会发生变化。第三，看看将来。主要用远景规划对社员进行共产主义教育。江淮人民公社建成以后，明年的粮食生产计划在今年大丰收的基础上再跃增一倍到两倍。在水利上江淮人民公社计划使全社二万八千多亩稻田和稻麦田全部做到自流灌溉，一年不下雨也能保丰收。这些美好的远景强烈地打动了社员们的心。大家认识到，现在所谓富社，不过是小富，如与将来比根本不算富，只有组织人民公社以后才能更富。这样的算账辩论，思想越辩越透，账越算越深入。铁一般的事实驳倒了少数人的“吃亏论”。大家一致认为，“富不带穷，强不带弱”是错误的，一定要打掉本位主义，联合起来办人民公社，人多，钱多，规模大，力量大，才能办大事。由于战胜了本位主义思想，江淮人民公社已顺利地于8月8日召开社员代表大会，正式宣告成立。原来七个小社已分别组成七个生产大队。
    经过群众性的大辩论，共产主义思想大大发扬，建社中存在的问题已迎刃而解，现在全社正在开展共产主义大协作，生产上出现了新的高潮。最近曙光、仰光、光明、江淮四个队已主动抽出五千六百元支援大井、交通两个队买种子，买肥料，办土化肥厂。曙光、仰光、光明三个队已调出七万二千三百斤颗粒肥料和三十五头耕牛支援大井队和交通队。肥南队有五百多亩稻倒伏，快要发芽，急需收割，可是缺乏劳动力，其他六个队立即调出六百多人前往帮助抢收，一天一夜就抢收完毕，使五百多亩稻没有受到损失。社员们看到公社发挥了强大的威力，生产干劲更大。很多社员说：“公社真正好，互相大协作，天大的困难也能克服掉。”
