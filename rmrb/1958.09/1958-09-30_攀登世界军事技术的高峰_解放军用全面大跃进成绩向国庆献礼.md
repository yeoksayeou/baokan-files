Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: Under the shining light of Mao Zedong's military thought, the various branches and arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, marching towards a modernized revolutionary army, have, this year, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, displayed an unprecedented and vibrant Great Leap Forward in all aspects, including combat readiness, training, construction, culture, and science. With the speed of "one day equaling twenty years," they are scaling the heights of world military technology, becoming an invincible armed force, both politically sophisticated and technically skilled, capable of defending the motherland and safeguarding peace.

Since the spring, the entire army, breaking down superstitions and liberating thought, has put forward the slogan of "one specialty, multiple skills; one soldier, multiple uses" in military training. This slogan quickly became the action of the broad masses of officers and soldiers. The artillery units launched the "all-around gunner" movement, with many gunners not only mastering all the actions on the cannon but also able to drive the gun carriage and command in place of the gun commander. In the armored forces, "all-around tank men" who can command, shoot, and drive tanks emerged in divisions and regiments. In the navy, not only did a large number of "all-around ships" capable of steering, shooting, and measuring wind direction and water depth appear, but also "ship medium repairs and minor repairs without entering the factory" was generally achieved. While a large number of "all-weather" pilots with both proficient flying skills and a high level of tactical expertise emerged, the air force units also saw a batch of "all-around mechanics," "all-around special equipment groups," and "all-around command posts." The "all-around rifleman" movement in the infantry was even more surging, sweeping the entire army. After many soldiers learned to use multiple weapons simultaneously, they learned the actions of junior commanders. A certain infantry unit on the Fujian front also carried out "all-around gunner" training. They said that they would use cannons for long-range attacks and guns for close-range combat, mastering all eighteen martial arts to guarantee the defense of the motherland. Cooks, medics, drivers, and automobile drivers in various units also learned to use multiple weapons and became excellent combat soldiers. In the organs, the "all-rounder" movement also enabled a large number of officers to be both versatile in military and civilian affairs. This magnificent "all-around" and "all-excellent" movement has rapidly pushed the army's technical level to a new peak, not only greatly shortening training time—completing the annual task in three months—but also fully demonstrating its unparalleled superiority in the recent battles on the Fujian front.

While military training is leaping forward, the inventions, creations, and technological innovations in military equipment in various units are also changing with each passing day, and heroes are emerging in large numbers. In addition to the continuous emergence of new equipment, significant achievements have also been made in reducing the load on the troops and increasing the mobility of the troops. The "multi-purpose" reconnaissance equipment reformed by Hu Dianyi, chief of the reconnaissance section of a certain unit, is very convenient to carry. The solid alcohol and nutritious military rations manufactured by the General Logistics Department all guarantee the combat needs of mobile units. In the engineering corps, officers and soldiers have put forward more than 200,000 rationalization proposals in the past six months.

With the heroic spirit of marching towards a great cultural advance, the entire army launched a massive literacy campaign, creating achievements of three months equaling three years. Many soldiers who have just shed their illiteracy hats are now greatly reading philosophy and Chairman Mao's works.

This overall leap forward situation was formed after the entire army of officers and soldiers, through the great rectification movement, greatly improved their political consciousness and put politics in command. Marshal Peng Dehuai recently summarized it into two basic experiences at the Party Congress of the troops in the Shenyang area: "Of all the thousands of things, putting politics in command is the first; of all the thousands of difficulties, relying on the masses is not difficult." At present, officers and soldiers of the entire army are further implementing and applying these experiences, continuing to exert their energy and climb new peaks.

### 攀登世界军事技术的高峰  解放军用全面大跃进成绩向国庆献礼

    攀登世界军事技术的高峰
    解放军用全面大跃进成绩向国庆献礼
    据新华社29日讯  高举毛泽东军事思想红旗，向现代化革命军队迈进的中国人民解放军各军种兵种部队，今年在总路线的光辉照耀下，战备、训练、施工、文化科学等各个方面都出现了前所未有的朝气蓬勃的大跃进的局面。他们以“一天等于二十年”的速度，攀登着世界军事技术的高峰，成为一支既有高度政治素养，又有熟练的技术水平的攻无不克、战无不胜的保卫祖国、捍卫和平的武装力量。
    入春以来，全军上下大破迷信，解放思想，在军事训练中提出了“一专多能，一兵多用”的口号。这个口号迅速成为广大官兵的行动。炮兵部队开展了“全能炮手”运动，许多炮手不仅能掌握大炮上所有的动作，而且能驾驶炮车，代替炮长指挥。在装甲兵部队，人人能指挥，个个能射击和驾驶坦克的“全能坦克手”，成师成团的涌现着。在海军，不仅出现了大批的人人能操舵、射击、测量风向、水深等“全能舰艇”，而且普遍地作到了“舰艇中修、小修不进厂”。在出现大量的既有熟练飞行技术又有高度战术水平的“全天侯”飞行员的同时，空军部队里还出现了一批“全能机械师”、“全能特设组”和“全能指挥所”。步兵部队的“全能枪手”运动更是汹涌澎湃地席卷全军，许多士兵学会了同时使用多种武器以后，学会了初级指挥员的动作。福建前线步兵某部还进行了“全能炮手”学习，他们说，远了用炮打，近了用枪射，十八般武艺都精通，保卫祖国有保证。各部队的炊事员、卫生员、驭手和汽车司机等也学会了使用多种武器，成了优秀的战斗兵。在机关里，“多面手”运动也使大批军官文武双全。这个波澜壮阔的“全能”“全优”运动，把全军的技术水平迅速推向一个新的高峰，不仅大大缩短了训练时间，三个月完成全年任务，在福建前线最近的战斗中，充分显示了它的无比优越性。
    在军事训练飞跃前进的同时，各部队在军事装备上的发明创造和技术革新也是日新月异，英雄辈出。除了新的装备不断出现以外，在减轻部队负荷量，增加部队机动性方面也取得了重大成绩。某部侦察处长胡典一改制的“一具多用”的侦察器材，携带很方便，总后勤部制造的固体酒精、营养丰富的军用口粮等，都保证了机动部队的战斗需要。工程兵部队，半年来官兵们提出的合理化建议达二十多万项。
    在向文化大进军的豪迈气概下，全军开展了一个声势浩大的扫盲运动，创造出三个月等于三年的成绩。许多刚摘掉文盲帽子的士兵，正在大读哲学和毛主席的著作。
    这个全面跃进的局面，是全体官兵经过伟大的整风运动，大大提高了政治觉悟，政治挂帅以后形成的。彭德怀元帅最近在沈阳地区部队党代表大会上把它归结为两条基本经验：“千条万条，政治挂帅第一条；千难万难，依靠群众就不难。”目前，全军官兵正在进一步贯彻运用这些经验，继续鼓足干劲，攀登新的高峰。
