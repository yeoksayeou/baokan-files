Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 21st. The delegates attending the first session of the Second Guangdong Provincial People's Congress resolutely support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, protest the new provocative acts of U.S. imperialism, and firmly support the struggle to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan. The delegates held a special meeting today regarding Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement.

Liang Biao, director of the Guangzhou Wuxianmen Power Plant with thirty years of service, said, "We workers fully support this statement. The staff and workers are determined to strengthen military training and launch a greater leap forward, resolutely supporting the liberation of Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan with practical actions." Huo Qinghui, an engineer at the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant, said, "Our more than 600 million people have the full strength to drive the U.S. aggressors out of Taiwan, just as we expelled the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique from mainland China." Wang Hanguo, a national model agricultural worker, said, "Minister Chen Yi's words are very correct. We guarantee to increase grain production to support the liberation of Jinmen and Mazu. When needed, we will take up arms to eliminate the U.S. aggressors."

Li Langru, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, said, "The thuggish face of U.S. imperialism has been seen through by the people of the world. Our liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair, and no one is allowed to interfere, nor can they interfere."

Xiao Junying, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, denounced Dulles's speech as completely piratical nonsense. He said, "I also want to warn the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan to make a decisive decision, perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, and respond to the call of the people of the motherland to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands; otherwise, there will only be a dead end."

Ant Mei Hou, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Lin Donghai, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou City Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, and Professor Wang Yue, Vice President of Jinan University, all sternly refuted Dulles's shameless lies, resolutely supported the struggle to liberate Jinmen and Mazu, and pointed out that in the face of the unprecedentedly powerful Chinese people, if U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, it will surely suffer a devastating blow.

    广东人代会代表集会
    抗议美帝国主义新的挑衅
    新华社广州21日电　正在举行的广东省第二届人民代表大会第一次会议的代表们坚决拥护陈毅外交部长的声明，抗议美帝国主义新的挑衅行为，坚决支持解放金门、马祖和台湾的斗争。代表们今天曾就陈毅外长的声明专门举行了集会。
    有三十年工龄的广州五仙门发电厂厂长梁彪说，我们工人完全拥护这个声明。职工们决心加强军事训练，掀起更大的跃进高潮，坚决以实际行动支援解放金门、马祖和台湾。广州钢铁厂工程师霍庆辉说，我们六亿多人民完全有力量像把蒋介石卖国集团驱逐出中国大陆一样，把美国侵略者赶出台湾去。全国农业劳动模范汪汉国说，陈毅部长的话说得很对，我们保证多增产粮食支援解放金门、马祖，需要的时候就拿起武器去消灭美国侵略者。
    政协广东省委副主席李朗如说，美帝国主义的强盗面目已经被全世界人民识破。我们解放台湾是中国的内政，什么人都不许干涉，也干涉不了。
    民革广东省委副主任委员萧隽英痛斥杜勒斯的发言完全是海盗的谰言。他说，我还要警告在台湾的国民党军政人员，要当机立断、立功赎罪，响应祖国人民解放台湾及沿海岛屿的号召，不然只有死路一条。
    广东省归国华侨联合会主任蚁美厚，台盟广州市支部筹委主任林东海和暨南大学副校长王越教授，都严正地驳斥了杜勒斯的无耻谰言，坚决支持解放金门、马祖的斗争，并且指出，在空前强大的中国人民面前，如果美帝国主义胆敢发动侵略战争，他们一定要遭到毁灭性的打击。
