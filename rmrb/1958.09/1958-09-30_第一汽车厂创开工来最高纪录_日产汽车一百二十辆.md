Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, September 29th: The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant presented a high-yield "satellite" gift of 120 automobiles produced in a single day to celebrate the 9th anniversary of the National Day on September 28th. The daily output exceeded the usual output by about one time. Now, all the workers in the factory are fighting day and night to produce two thousand "Liberation" brand automobiles in a short period to support the iron and steel industry.

Amidst the rapid development of the national iron and steel industry, transportation is becoming increasingly strained. Recently, the state increased the allocation of steel to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. On the 24th, the plant made an emergency decision: to fight for five days before National Day and, while producing new products such as "Red Flag", "East Wind" and three-axle high off-road performance heavy-duty trucks, to produce six hundred to seven hundred "Liberation" brand automobiles day and night at the fastest speed, so as to supply two thousand automobiles to the iron and steel front between September and October.

The 26th was the first day of this battle. The workers worked from morning until 10 p.m., producing 100 automobiles and winning the first battle. From 8 a.m. on the 27th to 5 a.m. on the 28th, another 100 automobiles were produced. From 11:30 a.m. on the 28th to 2 a.m. on the 29th, 120 automobiles were produced, setting the highest daily output record in the two years since the plant opened. On this day, excluding the time for stopping assembly, an automobile was assembled on average every four minutes or so. Now, all the workers in the factory are continuing to fight towards the higher goal of 150 automobiles.

In this battle, the communist style of the workers was very prominent. The directors and Party organization secretaries of the chassis, engine, stamping, heat treatment and other workshops constantly and proactively came to the final assembly workshop during the tense command of their own workshop production to ask what was lacking and what was needed, and supplied them in a timely manner. The Changchun Automobile Parts Factory, which produces collaborative products, broke a "punch" on the night of the 25th. Workers from the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant rushed to make one that night and sent it the next morning.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, September 28th: The second "Red Flag" brand high-end sedan—a convertible parade car—was manufactured at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant late on the 27th and was transported to Beijing today to participate in the "Eleventh" National Day celebration. This is a gift from the factory's workers to the National Day.

    第一汽车厂创开工来最高纪录
    日产汽车一百二十辆
    据新华社长春29日电  第一汽车制造厂28日以日产一百二十辆汽车的高产“卫星”向国庆九周年献礼。日产量超过平时产量一倍左右。现在全厂职工正为短期内拿出两千辆解放牌汽车支援钢铁工业而日夜奋战。
    在全国钢铁工业飞跃发展中，交通运输日益紧张。最近国家给第一汽车制造厂增拨钢材，这个厂24日作出紧急决定：国庆节前奋战五天，在生产“红旗”“东风”和三轴传动高越野性能载重汽车等新产品的同时，要以最快的速度日夜突击生产六百到七百辆解放牌汽车，以便9、10月间拿出两千辆汽车供应钢铁战线。
    26日是这场奋战的第一天，职工们从早晨一直干到晚间十点，生产汽车一百辆，打了第一个胜仗。27日早八点到28日早五点又产一百辆。28日上午十一点半到29日早晨二点，出产了一百二十辆，创造了开工两年来日产量最高纪录。这一天扣除停装的时间不算，平均每四分多钟就装出一辆汽车。现在全厂职工正向一百五十辆的更高目标继续奋战。
    在这场奋战中，职工们的共产主义风格表现得非常鲜明。底盘、发动机、冲压、热处理等车间的主任和党组织书记，在紧张指挥本车间生产的间隙中，不断主动地到总装配车间来询问缺少什么需要什么，及时供应。生产协作产品的长春汽车配件厂25日夜间坏了一个“冲头”，第一汽车制造厂的工人当夜即赶制了一个，第二天一早就送去了。
    新华社长春28日电  第二辆“红旗”牌高级轿车——敞篷检阅轿车，27日深夜在第一汽车制造厂制成后，今天运往北京参加“十一”国庆大典。这是这个厂职工向国庆节献出的礼物。
