Brothers are like limbs, struggle cannot be separated.
Tsend and Damba Say:
Invading China is Invading Mongolia

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 22nd – Tsend, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Acting Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, and Damba, First Secretary of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, both stated when receiving Xie Fusheng, the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia today, that the Mongolian people fully support the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan.

Tsend said when receiving Xie Fusheng at noon today that the Mongolian people regard the Chinese people's struggle as their own and will fully support the Chinese people's struggle morally and with the fruits of their labor. He said that the Mongolian people will always stand with the Chinese people.

Subsequently, Damba said when receiving Xie Fusheng that the struggle against American imperialism is the common struggle of all socialist countries. American imperialist aggression against Chinese territory is like aggression against Mongolian territory. He said that after seeing Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area, the Mongolian people held rallies across the country to express their support for the statement and strongly protest against American imperialist armed provocations. Damba also said that the Chinese people's struggle is just and it will surely be victorious.

In their talks, Tsend and Damba repeatedly praised the new and great achievements made by the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward.

    曾德和达姆巴说
    侵略中国就是侵略蒙古
    新华社乌兰巴托22日电　蒙古人民共和国部长会议第一副主席、代理部长会议主席曾德和蒙古人民革命党第一书记达姆巴今天分别在接见中国新任驻蒙古大使谢甫生时，都表示蒙古人民全力支持中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争。
    曾德在今天中午接见谢甫生时说，蒙古人民把中国人民的斗争当作自己的斗争，并且将在道义上和以劳动的成果全面支持中国人民的斗争。他说，蒙古人民永远和中国人民站在一起。
    随后，达姆巴在接见谢甫生时说，反对美帝国主义的斗争是社会主义各国的共同斗争。美帝国主义侵略中国领土就像侵略蒙古的领土一样。他说，蒙古人民在看到中国总理周恩来关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明以后，纷纷在全国各地举行集会，表示支持这项声明，坚决抗议美帝国主义的武装挑衅。达姆巴还说，中国人民的斗争是正义的，它一定会得到胜利。
    曾德和达姆巴在谈话中都一再赞扬中国人民在大跃进中取得的新的伟大成就。
