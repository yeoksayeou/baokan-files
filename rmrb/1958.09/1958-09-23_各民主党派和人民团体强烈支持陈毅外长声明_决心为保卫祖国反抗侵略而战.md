Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: Leaders of various democratic parties in our country have enthusiastically supported Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, sternly refuted Dulles' shameless lies at the United Nations General Assembly, which turned black into white, and expressed their full support for the struggle to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan.
    The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held a meeting on the evening of the 21st, presided over by Chairman Li Jishen. Participants in the meeting unanimously pointed out that Dulles' speech at the United Nations General Assembly was extremely barbaric, absurd, and utterly shameless, once again exposing the gangster face of American imperialism, proving that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of all peace-loving countries and people in the world. Speakers firmly stated their support for liberating Jinmen, Mazu, and other coastal islands and Taiwan, thoroughly eliminating the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, and resolutely not allowing any foreign obstruction or interference. If American imperialism dares to impose war on the Chinese people, they will not hesitate to make any sacrifices and vow to fight American imperialism to the end.
    Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, said in a statement: Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement fully expresses the will and determination of our people to liberate Taiwan. American invading troops must withdraw from Taiwan and its surrounding islands. If the American imperialists dare to impose war on our people, the great Chinese people have ample strength to smash it to pieces. Dulles and his ilk think that by falsely accusing our country as an "aggressor," they can cover up the American aggressors' aggressive activities against our country. This will only further enrage our six hundred million people, further enrage peace-loving countries and people all over the world, tighten the noose around the necks of the American aggressors themselves, and end in a more tragic failure.
    Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: Taiwan, Penghu, and coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu have been Chinese territory since ancient times, which no one can deny. In order to achieve its aggressive ambitions, the American aggressors, Eisenhower and Dulles, ignored the facts and made self-deceiving statements, only exposing their wolfish ambitions to the people of the world. Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement represents the will of our six hundred million people. All members of the China Democratic National Construction Association fully support it and are determined to fight to resist aggression, to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and together with the people of the whole country, even at the cost of sacrifice!
    Wang Shaoyu, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: The American imperialists continue to interfere in our country's recovery of coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu, intensifying military provocations. On the other hand, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made a diatribe at the United Nations General Assembly, turning black into white, and falsely accused our country of being an "aggressor," creating a smokescreen for the American imperialists to prepare for war. We want to warn the American imperialists: If the U.S. military does not withdraw from the Taiwan area and dares to impose war on us, we will smash this paper tiger to pieces!
    Ji Fang, Acting Chairman of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, said: Coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu are our country's territory. The Chinese people will never tolerate their territory being used by imperialists to carry out harassing military activities against our mainland and coastal areas. We must recover Jinmen and Mazu, and we must liberate Taiwan. Dulles shamelessly and falsely accused our country of being an "aggressor" at the United Nations General Assembly and attempted to play his "ceasefire" conspiracy, which cannot but further arouse the anger of our six hundred million people! All members of our Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party must resolutely unite with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, not hesitate to make any sacrifices, fight to resist aggressors, and fight to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our great motherland!
    Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, said: If the American aggressors dare to disregard the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and the resolute opposition of the people of the world, and stubbornly impose war on the Chinese people, all comrades of our Zhi Gong Party will closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party and, together with our six hundred million compatriots, fight American aggressors to the end, not hesitating to sacrifice everything to resist aggression and defend peace, and to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland. We will actively do our job well, respond to the call of the motherland at any time, and vow not to give up until Taiwan and coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu are liberated.
    Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said: The war threats and atomic blackmail of American imperialism have long gone bankrupt. The American aggressors are the defeated army of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people will never be intimidated by their war threats. Our six hundred million people have the confidence, strength, and preparation to give the American aggressors a fatal blow. On behalf of all members of the Jiusan Society, I firmly express that under the leadership of the Party and the government, we will contribute all our strength and fight to the end for our just cause.
    Xu Mengshan, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said: The Taiwanese compatriots, who have a tradition of resisting imperialist aggressors, resolutely oppose American aggression. The American robbers must get out of Taiwan. Any military threat cannot frighten the great Chinese people. If the American aggressors dare to expand the war, then our united six hundred million people will surely give the aggressors a head-on blow and beat them until they are utterly defeated.

Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: People's organizations such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, and the Central Committee the Communist Youth League of China have issued statements unanimously supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement refuting Dulles' speech at the United Nations General Assembly, protesting the repeated violations of our country's territorial waters and airspace by the American armed forces, and demanding that the American aggressors get out of Taiwan.
    The statement of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: The Chinese workers, together with the Chinese people, are determined to fight to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, and to fight for the complete liberation of the motherland's territory. The Chinese workers must produce more steel, produce all the equipment needed by the People's Liberation Army, and, together with the People's Liberation Army, give the American robbers a clean and thorough annihilating blow. The American robbers must immediately stop interfering in China's internal affairs, must immediately stop military provocations and war threats against the Chinese people, and must immediately withdraw all armed forces in the Taiwan area!
    The statement of the All-China Women's Federation said: Chinese women resolutely protest this shameless slander of American imperialism. The Chinese people and Chinese women will never allow this conspiracy to succeed. If American imperialism disregards the repeated warnings of our government, disregards the angry protests of our six hundred million people, and dares to impose war on the Chinese people, then Chinese women will, together with the people of the whole country, bravely participate in the battle to defend the motherland, defend world peace, and defend mothers and children, not hesitating to make any sacrifices, resolutely eliminate the aggressors, and be determined to bury the aggressors in the Taiwan Strait!
    The joint statement of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation said: If American imperialism dares to impose war on us, the 120 million Chinese youths are determined not to hesitate to make any sacrifices, respond to the call of the motherland at any time, take up arms, go to the forefront of defending the motherland and defending peace, and give the American imperialist robbers a devastating blow. The enemy attacks from there, and we will make them perish there. We must resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate the aggressors!

    各民主党派和人民团体强烈支持陈毅外长声明
    决心为保卫祖国反抗侵略而战
    新华社22日讯　我国各民主党派领导人热烈拥护陈毅外交部长的声明，严厉驳斥杜勒斯在联合国大会上颠倒黑白的无耻谎言，并且表示全力支援解放金门、马祖和台湾的斗争。
    中国国民党革命委员会中央在21日晚举行集会，集会由李济深主席主持。参加集会的人一致指出，杜勒斯在联合国大会上的发言，真是蛮横已极，荒谬绝伦，无耻透顶，再一次暴露了美国的流氓强盗面目，证明美帝国主义是全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的死敌。发言的人坚决表示要支援解放金门、马祖等沿海岛屿和台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石反动集团的残余势力，决不容许任何外国进行阻挠和干涉。如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在中国人民的头上，就不惜任何牺牲，誓与美帝国主义斗争到底。
    中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒发表谈话，说：陈毅外交部长的声明完全表达了我国人民一定要解放台湾的意志和决心。美国侵略军必须撤离台湾及其附近岛屿。如果美帝国主义者胆敢把战争强加在我国人民头上，伟大的中国人民有着充分的力量将它击得粉碎。杜勒斯之流以为反诬我国为“侵略者”，就可以掩盖美国侵略者对我国的侵略活动，这只有更加激怒我国六亿人民，更加激怒全世界爱好和平的国家和人民，而给美国侵略者自己套在脖子上的绞索绞得更紧，并以更悲惨的失败而告终。
    中国民主建国会中央委员会主任委员黄炎培说：台湾、澎湖及金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，自古以来就是中国的领土，这是任何人都不能否认的。美国侵略者为了达到它的侵略野心，艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯竟抹煞事实，作出自欺欺人之谈，徒然把他们的狼子野心，暴露在世界人民的面前。陈毅外长的声明，代表了我国六亿人民的意志，民建会全体会员完全拥护，决心不惜牺牲，在中国共产党的领导下，和全国人民一起，为反抗侵略而战，为维护祖国的主权和领土完整而战，为保卫远东和世界的和平而战！　
    中国民主促进会副主席王绍鍪说：美帝国主义者一面继续干涉我国收复金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，加紧扩大军事挑衅，另一面美国国务卿杜勒斯在联合国大会上大放厥词，颠倒黑白，竟然反诬我国为“侵略者”，为美帝国主义者准备战争施放烟幕。我们要警告美帝国主义者：如果美军不撤出台湾地区，胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，我们一定把这只纸老虎戳得粉碎！
    农工民主党代理主席季方说：金门和马祖等沿海岛屿是我国的领土，中国人民决不能容忍自己的领土被帝国主义者利用来对我国大陆和沿海地区进行骚扰性的军事活动，我们一定要收复金门、马祖，一定要解放台湾。杜勒斯竟在联合国大会上无耻地反诬我国为“侵略者”，并图玩弄其“停火”阴谋，这就不能不更加激起我国六亿人民的愤怒！我们农工民主党的全体成员，一定要在中国共产党领导下坚决和全国人民团结一道，不惜任何牺牲，为反抗侵略者而战，为维护我们伟大祖国的主权和领土完整而战！
    中国致公党主席陈其尤说：如果美国侵略者胆敢不顾中国人民的一再警告和世界人民的坚决反对，硬把战争强加在中国人民头上，我们致公党的全体同志们，一定紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，和六亿同胞一道，为反抗侵略保卫和平，为维护祖国的主权和领土完整不惜牺牲一切和美国侵略者战斗到底。积极搞好岗位工作，随时响应祖国召唤，不解放台湾和金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，誓不罢休。
    九三学社主席许德珩说：美帝国主义的战争恐吓、原子讹诈早已破产了，美国侵略者是中国人民手下的败军，中国人民绝不会为它们的战争恐吓所吓倒。我们六亿人民有信心、有力量、有准备给美国侵略者以致命的打击。我代表九三学社全体社员坚决表示在党和政府的领导下贡献一切力量，为我们的正义事业而斗争到底。
    台湾民主自治同盟秘书长徐萌山说：有着反抗帝国主义侵略者传统的台湾同胞坚决反对美国侵略，美国强盗必须从台湾滚出去。任何武力威胁是吓不倒伟大的中国人民的，美国侵略者如果胆敢扩大战争，那末，我国团结一致的六亿人民必将给侵略者以迎头痛击，打得它落花流水。
    据新华社22日讯　中华全国总工会、全国妇女联合会、中国共产主义青年团中央委员会等人民团体发表声明，一致拥护陈毅外交部长驳斥杜勒斯在联合国大会上发言的声明，抗议美国武装力量一再侵犯我国领海和领空，要美国侵略者滚出台湾去。
    全国总工会的声明中说：中国工人和中国人民一道，坚决为保卫祖国主权和领土完整而战，为祖国土地全部解放而战。中国工人要生产出更多钢铁、要生产出人民解放军需要的一切装备和人民解放军一起给美国强盗以干净彻底歼灭的打击。美国强盗必须立即停止干涉中国的内政，必须立即停止对中国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，必须立即撤出在台湾地区的一切武装力量！
    全国妇联的声明中说：中国妇女坚决抗议美帝国主义的这种无耻谰言，中国人民和中国妇女绝不容许这种阴谋得逞。如果美帝国主义不顾我国政府的一再警告，不顾我国六亿人民愤怒的抗议，胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，那么，中国妇女将和全国人民一道为保卫祖国，保卫世界和平，保卫母亲和儿童，英勇地参加战斗，不惜任何牺牲，坚决消灭侵略者，决心把侵略者埋葬在台湾海峡！
    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会的联合声明中说：如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，一亿二千万中国青年决心不惜任何牺牲，随时响应祖国的召唤，拿起武器，走向保卫祖国，保卫和平的最前线，给美帝国主义强盗以毁灭性的打击，敌人从那里进攻，我们就要它在那里灭亡。我们一定要坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭侵略者！
