Thoughts on Visiting Dengjia Fort
(To the Tune of *Xi Jiang Yue*)

　　Yesterday, mountains were barren and gullies treacherous,
　　Yellow sand and red water flowed rampant,
　　How much sorrow, how much grief,
　　How many broken walls and ruins?
　　One battle at Dengjia Fort,
　　Splitting mountains, storing water, filling gullies,
　　Fragrant fruit, ripe grain, celebrating a bumper harvest,
　　A newly embroidered Earth.

(This was written by a representative from Guangdong who attended the Third National Soil and Water Conservation Conference)

    参观邓家堡有感
      （西江月）
        昨日山穷沟险，
        黄沙赤水横流，
        几多悲苦几多愁，
        残壁断墙多少？
        一战邓家堡上，
        劈山蓄水填沟，
        果香粮熟庆丰收，
        一幅地球新绣。
    （这是参加全国第三次水土保持会议的广东一代表写的）
