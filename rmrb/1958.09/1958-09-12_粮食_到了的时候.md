    When the "Grain" Arrived
　　By our reporter Yin Chongjing
    On the night of August 27th, under a bright early autumn moon, a train pulled out of Shijiazhuang station, speeding across the quiet North China Plain. This train was loaded with one hundred and fifty tons of new "grain" that the entire party and people of the Shijiazhuang area had just harvested. This "grain" was not wheat or corn for people to eat, but pig iron sent to Marshal Steel.
    "Grain," this batch of iron "grain" arrived just in time, the steelmaking workers of the Tianjin Xinxing Steel Plant were looking forward to it. This steel plant produced more than 80,000 tons of steel last year. This year, the workers are making leaps forward and are determined to double their output to 160,000 tons of steel. However, some time ago, the supply of pig iron was a bit insufficient, and the steelmaking workers were worried.
    At noon on August 29th, the "grain" train arrived at the West Freight Yard of Tianjin Station. The liaison officer stationed at the station from the Xinxing Steel Plant immediately reported the good news to the plant by telephone. The steelmaking workers who heard the news first spread the word and couldn't help but cheer, each eager to start a new battle immediately.
    After a day and night of full cooperation from railway and transportation company loading and unloading workers and truck drivers, all 150 tons of pig iron were transported to the factory by the afternoon of the 30th. Each ingot of gray-black iron seemed exceptionally lovely in the eyes of the steelmaking workers.
    How was this pig iron produced? The steelmaking workers were not entirely clear. Comrade Li Xianhua, the party branch secretary of the workshop, told everyone: "This was mined and smelted by the millions of peasant brothers in the Shijiazhuang area. They also need pig iron to make agricultural implements and tools locally, but considering the needs of the entire country for steelmaking, they transported it to support us as soon as it was produced." Upon hearing this, the workers were both surprised and delighted, and started discussing it. Many people said: The noble communist spirit of our peasant brothers is worth learning from. Now that we have iron, the next step is up to us!
    Due to excessive excitement, many people could not sleep well that night. Repair workers went to work early before dawn to repair and bake the furnace. On the afternoon of the 31st, a large red banner was hung in front of the wide factory gate of the steelmaking workshop, and colorful slogans were posted everywhere on the walls and pillars. The faces of the workers were full of joy. At five o'clock sharp, the workers of the No. 3 converter's C shift took turns smelting the first furnace of pig iron supported by the peasant brothers. They held a pre-shift meeting excitedly and solemnly. Foreman Song Shuwen proposed: "This is the result of the hard work of the peasants, we must refine the steel well and not allow it to be ruined." He said that this batch of iron contains more sulfur and is not easy to refine, asking everyone if they can overcome this difficulty. The steelmaking workers who had been waiting impatiently almost shouted in unison: "Yes!" So, they let the converter with its huge mouth fully absorb the already melted iron, and let the blower roar to help it digest as quickly as possible. They adopted methods such as lengthening the early stage of blowing and increasing alkalinity to achieve the best desulfurization effect.
    The steelmakers held the gate of the ventilation duct, holding the long steel sampling rod... each one staring intently at the sparks flying from the top of the furnace, anxiously and excitedly waiting. Twenty-one minutes later, furnace worker Han Jiapeng took a spoonful of fiery red molten iron from the furnace and poured it into the sample trough. Song Kunheng, the experienced steelmaking team leader, took it and looked through the blue protective glasses. The sparks were jumping neither too high nor too low, emitting countless grain-like small balls. He cheered: "Great!" Foreman Song Shuwen gestured and issued an order: "Out!" The worker Li Zhijiang on the steelmaking platform immediately started the rotary gate, and the majestic body of the converter tilted, after skimming the slag, the molten steel, as hot and boiling as the workers' mood at the time, flowed out. In less than ten minutes, the telephone on the steelmaking platform rang "ding-a-ling". Li Zhijiang picked up the headset, and a girl's impatient voice came from the laboratory: The quality of this furnace of steel is extremely good, and the content of carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus, and sulfur all meets the standards. At this moment, the whole workshop was excited, everyone cheered: Peasant brothers, we thank you and will never let you down!

### “粮食”到了的时候

    “粮食”到了的时候
　　本报记者　尹崇敬
    8月27日，一个初秋的月明之夜，一列火车开出石家庄车站，在静静的华北大平原上疾驰着。在这列火车上，装载有石家庄地区全党全民刚刚收获下来的一百五十吨新“粮食”。这种“粮食”并不是给人们食用的小麦或者玉米，而是给钢铁元帅送来的生铁。
    “粮食”，这批铁的“粮食”来得太是时候了，天津新兴钢厂的炼钢工人们正在盼望着它们。这个钢厂，去年生产了八万多吨钢，今年工人们跃进再跃进，决心翻一番，产钢十六万吨。可是，前些日子生铁有点供应不足，炼钢工人们正在着急呢。
    8月29日中午，那列运“粮”火车开到了天津车站西货场。新兴钢厂驻站联络员立即把喜讯用电话报告给厂里。最先听到消息的炼钢工人奔走相告，情不自禁地欢呼叫好，个个磨拳擦掌，准备马上投入新的战斗。
    经过铁路和运输公司的装卸工人、汽车司机们一昼夜的全力合作，30日下午，一百五十吨生铁全部运到厂内。一锭锭灰黑色的铁块，在炼钢工人眼里觉得分外可爱。
    这些生铁是怎样生产出来的呢？炼钢工人们并不完全清楚。车间的党支部书记李咸华同志告诉了大家：“这是石家庄专区千万农民弟兄上山开采冶炼出来的。当地制造农具、工具也十分需要生铁，但是从整个国家炼钢需要出发，刚刚生产出来，他们就运来支援我们了。”工人们听这一说，真是又惊又喜，纷纷议论开了。许多人都说：农民兄弟这种高尚的共产主义精神，值得我们学习。现在有了铁，下一步就看我们的了！
    由于过分的激动，不少人这一夜没有能够很好地入睡。修炉工人天不亮就提前上班修炉烤炉。31日下午，炼钢车间的宽敞的厂房大门前挂起了大红横幅，墙壁上、柱子上到处贴起彩色标语，工人们的脸上个个喜气洋洋。五点整，三吨转炉丙班工人轮着冶炼农民弟兄支援的第一炉生铁。他们兴奋而又严肃地举行了班前会。工长宋书文提出：“这是农民千辛万苦的成果，我们一定要把钢炼好，不准炼坏。”他说，这批铁含硫多一些，不大好炼，问大家能不能克服这一困难。早已等待不及的炼钢工人几乎异口同声地喊出：“能！”于是，他们让张着巨大嘴巴的转炉饱吸了已经溶化的铁水，让鼓风机轰隆地震吼起来，帮助它尽快地消化。他们采取了吹炼前期时间拉长、增高碱度等办法，使脱硫效果达到最好的要求。
    炼钢手们把着通风管道的门闸，握着长长的取样的钢杆……个个凝神注视着火花飞舞的炉顶，焦急而又兴奋地期待着。二十一分钟以后，炉前工韩家鹏从炉中取出了一杓火红的铁水，倒在样槽内。饶有经验的炼钢组长宋坤恒接过去，通过蓝色护镜一看，那火花蹦得不高不低，散发着无数米粒状的小球。他欢呼起来：“太好了！”工长宋书文打了个手势，发出命令：“出吧！”炼钢台上的工人李志江立即开动转闸，转炉雄伟的身驱倾侧了过来，扒了渣以后，像工人们当时的心情一样炽热、沸腾的钢水流了出来。不到十分钟，炼钢台上的电话“滴铃铃”地响开了。李志江拿起耳机，从化验室传来了一个姑娘迫不及待的声音：这炉钢质量好极了，所含炭、矽、锰、磷、硫的成分全部合乎标准。这一下，全车间都兴奋了，大家欢呼：农民兄弟，我们感谢你们，绝不辜负你们！
