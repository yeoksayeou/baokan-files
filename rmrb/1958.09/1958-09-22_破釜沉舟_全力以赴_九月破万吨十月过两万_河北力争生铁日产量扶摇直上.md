    Break the Cauldrons and Sink the Boats, Go All Out
    Achieve 10,000 Tons in September, Exceed 20,000 in October
    Hebei Strives for Soaring Daily Pig Iron Production
    (Our report) Mobilizing the entire party and all the people of Hebei Province with the spirit of breaking cauldrons and sinking boats, seizing every opportunity, making every effort to concentrate manpower and material resources, and organizing an army of two to three million iron and steel workers to successfully pass the small hurdle of September, ensuring that the province achieves a daily pig iron production of 10,000 tons by the end of September as a gift to the National Day; resolutely breaking through the major hurdle of October, achieving a daily pig iron production of 20,000 tons in mid-October, and vigorously launching high-yield county satellites with a daily output of 1,000 tons of iron, opening up a new leap forward situation on the province's iron and steel front. This is the fighting call issued by Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, to the people of the entire province at the on-site meeting on normal production and high-yield experience of small blast furnaces in Shijiazhuang, convened by the Hebei Provincial Iron and Steel Headquarters.
    On September 17, the Hebei Provincial Iron and Steel Headquarters convened an on-site meeting on normal production and high-yield of small blast furnaces in Shijiazhuang. The meeting introduced the experience of normal production of small blast furnaces in Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant and Power Plant, which Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed to be promoted nationwide.
    Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, said at the meeting that the current iron and steel production in Hebei Province is at a critical juncture. The struggle we are waging on the iron and steel front is to overcome the iron and steel production hurdle. From September 1st to 15th, both steel and iron production have made great progress compared with August. However, the current rate of progress is far behind the needs of the situation. The low iron production has affected the large-scale increase in steel production. Therefore, we must move faster, immediately organize a larger leap forward centered on large-scale iron production, mobilize the entire party and all the people to seize the opportunity to make a concentrated assault, and resolutely complete this year's iron and steel tasks. Comrade Lin Tie said: All counties with abundant resources and better production conditions must be determined to strive to launch iron production satellites with a daily output of 500 tons, 800 tons, and 1,000 tons or even more. This task is arduous, but it is entirely possible to achieve. All localities must firmly grasp the following tasks: First, we must seize the construction of small blast furnaces. Strive to complete the construction of all 1,200 small blast furnaces as required by the Provincial Party Committee, and put them into production in large numbers and operate them normally. Second, we must quickly make the production of small blast furnaces greatly increase on the basis of normal production, allowing small blast furnaces to eat less, have more meals, and eat fine grains. Everyone should use the method of doctors treating stomach diseases to increase the digestive capacity of small blast furnaces and prevent blast furnaces from getting upset stomachs. Third, greatly develop the role of native furnaces. All localities should immediately start to finalize the design of native furnaces on the one hand, and create new forms of native furnaces on the other. Except for the Tianjin Special District, each special district should strive to have one or more counties launch high-yield satellites with a daily output of 1,000 tons of iron in late September. Fourth, party and government leaders at all levels must go all out, overcome all difficulties, and firmly grasp iron and steel production. We must mobilize all positive factors and concentrate a large amount of manpower and material resources to support iron and steel production with the spirit of stopping cars to make way and collecting grain and sending grass.

    破釜沉舟　全力以赴
    九月破万吨十月过两万
    河北力争生铁日产量扶摇直上
    本报讯　动员河北省全党全民以破釜沉舟的精神，利用一切时机，千方百计地集中人力物力，组织二三百万钢铁大军，胜利度过9月小关，保证9月底全省达到日产生铁万吨，向国庆节献礼；坚决闯过10月大关，10月中旬全省达到日产生铁两万吨，并大力发射日产千吨铁的高产县卫星，在全省钢铁战线上轰开一个新的跃进局面。这是中共河北省委第一书记林铁同志在河北省钢铁指挥部召开的石家庄小高炉正常生产及高产经验现场会议上对全省人民发出的战斗号召。
    9月17日河北省钢铁指挥部在石家庄市召开了小高炉正常生产及高产现场会议。会上介绍了刘少奇同志指示在全国推广的石家庄钢铁厂、动力厂小高炉正常生产的经验。
    中共河北省委第一书记林铁同志在会上说，当前河北省的钢铁生产正处在一个严重关头。我们在钢铁战线上进行的斗争，就是要闯过钢铁生产关。9月1日到15日，不论钢和铁的生产都比8月份有了很大的进展。但是目前的进展速度还远远落后于形势的需要，铁的产量低，已影响钢的大量增产。因此必须快马加鞭，马上组织一个以大量抓铁为中心的更大跃进，动员全党全民抓紧时机突击，坚决完成今年的钢铁任务。林铁同志说：凡是资源丰富生产条件较好的县，要决心争取放出日产五百吨、八百吨和一千吨甚至更大的产铁卫星。这个任务是艰巨的，但也是完全可能实现的。各地必须狠狠地抓好下面几件工作：一、必须抓紧小高炉的建设工作。力争按省委要求全部建成一千二百座小高炉，并且要大批投入生产，正常生产。二、要迅速使小高炉的生产在正常生产的基础上，大大提高产量，让小高炉少吃、多餐、吃细粮。大家要用医生治胃病的方法，增进小高炉的消化能力，不让高炉坏肚子。三、大大发挥土炉的作用，各地立即着手一面搞土炉的定型工作，一面创造新的土炉形式。除天津专区外，各专区要争取在9月下旬，有一个以上的县发出日产千吨铁的高产卫星。四、各级党政领导必须全力以赴，排除万难，狠狠地抓钢铁生产。必须以停车让路、筹粮送草的精神，调动一切积极因素，集中大量人力物力支援钢铁生产。
