Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 25th: The Central People's Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Han Xueye, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, arrived at the headquarters of the rear service forces of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the 24th to welcome the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army who are about to return home.

The delegation was warmly welcomed by General Zhang Mingyuan, General Peng Sheng, and all officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army's logistics forces. General Ding Laifu, representative of the Volunteer Army headquarters, was also present outside the camp gate to welcome the guests.

On the morning of the 24th, the Central People's Delegation of North Korea held a grand farewell meeting. Vice Chairman Han Xueye delivered a farewell speech at the meeting. He warmly praised the great victories and glorious contributions made by the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army's logistics forces during the Korean War and after the armistice. He said that the people of North Korea and China have forged friendship in the struggle against a common enemy and have developed it in the struggle against American imperialist aggression. At present, the American aggressors have no intention of withdrawing their claws of war from the East. We still need to fight the aggressors. Any aggressive conspiracy by the enemy will absolutely not stop us from advancing.

Then, Vice Chairman Han Xueye and Major General Han Mingxu, on behalf of the North Korean Party and government organs, Marshal Kim Il-sung, and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army, presented flags and gifts to the Volunteer Army's logistics leading organs. Members of the delegation also presented officers and soldiers' representatives with commemorative medals of Sino-Korean friendship.

General Zhang Mingyuan, head of the Volunteer Army's logistics forces, delivered a reply speech, expressing his heartfelt gratitude for the care of the Korean Labor Party, the government, the army, and all the people. He said that just as we are about to return to our motherland with our brotherly Korean people and People's Army comrades for peace, American imperialism is conspiring to launch a new armed aggression against our two countries. It can be asserted that today, when the strength of the people of North Korea and China is unprecedentedly strong, if the American aggressors do not learn from the past failures and dare to launch another war of aggression, what awaits them must be an even more tragic and shameful defeat.

After the meeting, North Korean artists accompanying the delegation performed wonderful programs for the officers and soldiers.

On the afternoon of the 24th, Vice Chairman Han Xueye and members of the delegation, accompanied by General Ding Laifu and General Peng Sheng, went deep into the logistics forces of the Volunteer Army to bid farewell to the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army.

That evening, the leading organs of the rear service forces of the Volunteer Army hosted a banquet to entertain the delegation and all the guests of the art troupe.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 25th: The Central People's Delegation of North Korea, accompanied by General Ding Laifu, representative of the Volunteer Army Headquarters, arrived at the headquarters of the artillery forces of the Volunteer Army this morning to welcome the artillery forces of the Volunteer Army who are about to return home. Here, the delegation held a farewell meeting. Han Xueye, head of the delegation and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea, highly praised the great power and glorious feats of the Volunteer Army's powerful artillery forces in the war against American aggression in his farewell speech. He wished the heroes of the Volunteer Army artillery forces more and greater victories in the new struggle. General Yang Junsheng, commander of the Volunteer Army Artillery, delivered a reply speech. He said that with the victorious development of the entire struggle situation, and with the increasing prosperity and strength of the democratic base in northern Korea, we firmly believe that the peaceful reunification of the three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains of North and South Korea will surely be realized. Han Xueye and Major General Han Mingxu, on behalf of the North Korean Party and government leading organs, Marshal Kim Il-sung, and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army, presented pennants and gifts to the Volunteer Army artillery forces. Members of the delegation presented officers and soldiers representatives with commemorative medals of Sino-Korean friendship.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 25th: More than 10,000 North Korean people in Pyongyang gave a warm send-off at Pyongyang Station tonight to the vanguard of the third batch of returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops passing through Pyongyang. Kim Yong-jin, Chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal People's Committee, said at the farewell meeting held on the station platform that the Korean people, who are connected with the Chinese people by flesh and blood, cannot remain indifferent to the provocative behavior of American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait, which is disrupting peace in the Far East and the world. He emphasized that aggression against the Chinese people is aggression against the Korean people, and any provocative behavior against the Chinese people is a serious threat to the Korean people. The Korean people will always advance together with the Chinese people in the struggle against the war policy of the American aggressors and in defense of peace in Asia and the world. He shouted: "American imperialism get out of South Korea and Taiwan!" At this time, more than 10,000 people in Pyongyang also raised their arms and shouted: "We will always be with the Chinese people!" "Long live Sino-Korean friendship!"

General Tang Jinlong, head of the vanguard of the third batch of returning Volunteer Army troops, even more severely condemned the criminal activities of American imperialism in continuing to create tension in the Far East and carrying out war provocations in the Taiwan Strait, regardless of the sincerity of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in withdrawing its troops from Korea. He emphasized that the American aggressors are the defeated underlings of the North Korean and Chinese peoples, and are paper tigers who are strong on the outside but weak on the inside. If they refuse to learn from the lessons of the Korean War and dare to provoke a new war, they will surely suffer an even greater and more disastrous defeat.

Tonight, Pyongyang Station was brightly lit, and the national flags of North Korea and China and portraits of Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong were hung high on the magnificent station building. At 8:20, when the first train carrying the third batch of returning Volunteer Army troops entered Pyongyang Station amidst the cheers of the masses holding flowers and colorful flags, Chairman Kim Yong-jin, who went to greet them, expressed his gratitude to the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers on behalf of the people of Pyongyang. He presented gifts to the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers on behalf of the people of Pyongyang. General Tang Jinlong expressed his warm gratitude and high respect to the Korean people and the heroic citizens of Pyongyang who have always given the Chinese People's Volunteer Army great care and love over the past eight years.

At 9:40, the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers bid farewell to the people of Pyongyang with reluctance, and the train left Pyongyang Station amidst shouts of "Bon Voyage".

    朝鲜中央人民代表团欢送志愿军归国部队
    新华社平壤25日电  以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会副委员长韩雪野为首的中央人民代表团，24日到达中国人民志愿军后方勤务部队领导机关驻地，欢送即将归国的志愿军官兵。
    代表团人员受到志愿军后勤部队首长张明远将军、彭盛将军以及全体官兵的热烈欢迎。到营门外欢迎客人的还有志愿军总部代表丁莱夫将军。
    24日上午，朝鲜中央人民代表团举行了隆重的欢送大会。韩雪野副委员长在会上致欢送词。他热烈赞扬志愿军后勤部队官兵在朝鲜战争中和停战后所取得的伟大胜利和光荣贡献。他说，朝中两国人民在反对共同敌人的斗争中结成了友谊，在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中得到了发展。目前，美国侵略者仍无意从东方缩回自己的战争魔爪。我们仍需要向侵略者进行斗争。敌人的任何侵略阴谋，都绝对阻挡不住我们前进。
    接着，韩雪野副委员长和韩明旭少将分别代表朝鲜党政机关、金日成元帅和人民军官兵，向志愿军后勤领导机关赠旗、赠礼。代表团团员还给官兵代表佩带了朝中友谊纪念章。

    大会结束后，随同代表团的朝鲜艺术家们给官兵们表演了精采节目。
    24日下午，韩雪野副委员长和代表团人员在丁莱夫将军、彭盛将军陪同下，深入到志愿军后勤部队中送别志愿军官兵。
    这天晚间，志愿军后方勤务部队领导机关设宴招待代表团和艺术团的全体客人。

    新华社平壤25日电  平壤市一万多朝鲜人民，今晚在平壤车站上，盛情欢送路过平壤的中国人民志愿军第三批归国部队的先头部队。平壤市人民委员会委员长金龙镇在车站月台上举行的欢送大会上说，同中国人民血肉相连的朝鲜人民对美帝国主义在台湾海峡扰乱远东和世界和平的挑衅行为，绝不能置若罔闻。他强调说，对中国人民的侵略就是对朝鲜人民的侵略，对中国人民的任何挑衅行为，也就是对朝鲜人民的严重威胁。朝鲜人民在反对美国侵略者的战争政策和维护亚洲和世界和平的斗争中，将永远同中国人民一起前进。他高呼：“美帝国主义从南朝鲜和台湾滚出去！”这时，一万多平壤市人民也一起振臂高呼：“我们永远同中国人民在一起！”“朝中友谊万岁！”
    志愿军第三批归国部队先头部队首长唐金龙将军在讲话中，更严厉谴责美帝国主义不顾中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤军的诚意，而继续在远东制造紧张局势，在台湾海峡进行战争挑衅的罪恶活动。他强调指出，美国侵略者是朝中人民的手下败将，是外强中干的纸老虎，它如果不肯接受朝鲜战争的教训，胆敢挑起新的战争，就必将遭到更大的惨败。
    今晚，平壤车站上灯火辉煌，宏伟的车站大楼上高悬着朝中两国国旗和金日成首相、毛泽东主席的画像。八时二十分，当载着志愿军第三批归国部队的第一列火车在手拿着鲜花和彩旗的群众欢呼声中驶进平壤车站时，前往欢送的金龙镇委员长代表平壤市人民向志愿军官兵们表示感谢。他代表平壤市人民向志愿军官兵们赠送了礼品。唐金龙将军向八年来一直给予中国人民志愿军以莫大的关怀和爱护的朝鲜人民和英雄的平壤市民表示热烈的感谢和崇高的敬意。
