Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 21st: People from all walks of life in Tianjin warmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement refuting U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' speech at the United Nations General Assembly. They expressed extreme anger at Dulles' shameless lies at the UN General Assembly and stated their firm determination to smash the provocations of the American aggressors with practical actions, resolutely fight to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, and fight to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

　　Liu Rude, leader of the Class A team of the Steelmaking Workshop II of Tianjin Xinxing Steel Plant, which has broken the city's converter steel production record three times since September 13th, said angrily that U.S. imperialism has occupied our territory of Taiwan, and Dulles has actually reversed black and white, saying that we are the "aggressors." This is simply a mad dog biting people indiscriminately. We must liberate Taiwan and liberate Jinmen and Mazu. As long as the motherland summons us, we will immediately take up arms and go to the front to strike at the American aggressors.

　　Zhang Guofan, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and a physicist, said that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement fully represents the wishes of the people of the whole country. U.S. imperialism has forcibly occupied our territory of Taiwan, but Dulles stubbornly said that China is the "aggressor" and absurdly raised the issue of a "ceasefire." This is completely the logic of a bandit. There is no "ceasefire" issue at all now; the issue is that U.S. imperialism must get out of Taiwan. Dulles' bandit logic cannot deceive anyone. Peace-loving Chinese people, in order to defend their territory and to defend peace in the Far East and the world, if the United States does not stop its aggression against us, we will resolutely fight it back.

　　All faculty, staff, and students of Tianjin University, which has just established the "Dongfeng Militia Division," unanimously support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement. The "Huang Jiguang Platoon," composed of twenty-six students from Class A of the third grade of the Industrial and Civil Construction major of the Civil Engineering Department, has been closely watching the development of the situation in the Taiwan Strait in the past few days. While attending classes, they are stepping up production in their self-operated "Red Flag" Cement Plant and are also conducting military training day and night. Jiang Baihui, the instructor of the "Huang Jiguang Platoon," said that we organized the "Huang Jiguang Platoon" to defend the territorial integrity of the motherland. As long as the motherland needs us, we will immediately go to the battlefield and heroically strike at the American jackals like Huang Jiguang.

    收起强盗逻辑　赶快滚出台湾
    天津人民愤怒斥责杜勒斯
    新华社天津21日电　天津市各界人民热烈拥护外交部长陈毅驳斥美国国务卿杜勒斯在联合国大会上发言的声明。对杜勒斯在联合国大会上发表的无耻谰言表示极大的愤怒，并且表示坚决用实际行动粉碎美国侵略者的挑衅，坚决为维护祖国的主权和领土完整而战，为保卫远东和世界和平而战。
    从9月13日起连创三次全市转炉炼钢生产新纪录的天津新兴钢厂炼钢二车间甲班工长刘如德愤怒地说，美帝国主义侵占了我国领土台湾，杜勒斯竟颠倒黑白说我们是“侵略者”，这简直是疯狗乱咬人。我们一定要解放台湾和解放金门、马祖，只要祖国一召唤，我们就立即拿起武器开赴前线，打击美国侵略者。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会天津分会副主席、物理学家张国藩说，陈毅外长的声明完全代表了全国人民的心意。美帝国主义用武力霸占了我国领土台湾，杜勒斯却硬说中国是“侵略者”，还荒谬地提出什么“停火”问题，这完全是强盗的逻辑。现在根本不存在什么“停火”的问题，而是美帝国主义从台湾滚出去的问题。杜勒斯的强盗逻辑是欺骗不了任何人的，爱好和平的中国人民为了保卫自己的领土，为了保卫远东和世界的和平，如果美国不停止对我们的侵略，我们就坚决把它打回去。
    刚刚成立了“东风民兵师”的天津大学全体师生员工一致拥护陈毅外长的声明。土木系工业和民用建筑专业三年级甲班的二十六名学生组成的“黄继光排”，这几天一直密切注视着台湾海峡局势的发展，他们一面上课，一面在自办的“红旗”水泥厂加紧生产，同时还日夜进行军事训练。“黄继光排”的指导员江百汇说，我们组织“黄继光排”，就是为了保卫祖国的领土完整，只要祖国需要，我们就马上走上战场，像黄继光那样英勇地打击美国豺狼。
