    Lofty Praise
    Zhang Xing, the director of the Tumote Banner Post and Telecommunications Bureau in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is an old Communist Party member who joined the revolution more than 20 years ago. He has countless scars all over his body and is in poor physical condition, nearly disabled. Recently, during flood prevention and rescue efforts, he used a boat to rescue three old women. He jumped into the water to pull the boat, pulling it for several miles before delivering the old women to the aid station. The old women were moved and said, "This man is really good; he must be a veteran Eighth Route Army soldier!"
    The old woman was right. Comrade Zhang Xing is indeed a veteran Eighth Route Army soldier. "He must be a veteran Eighth Route Army soldier!" – Lofty praise.

    崇高的评价
    内蒙古自治区土默特旗邮电局长张兴，是一个参加革命二十多年的老共产党员，全身有数不清的伤疤，体力较差，近于残废。最近在防洪抢救中，他用划子救出三位老太太。他跳下水去拉划子，拉了好几里地，才把老太太送到救护站。老太太感动地说：“这人真好，一定是个老八路！”
    这位老太太说得对。张兴同志就是老八路。“一定是个老八路！”——崇高的评价。
