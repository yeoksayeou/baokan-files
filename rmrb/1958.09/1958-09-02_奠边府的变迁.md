	Changes in Dien Bien Phu

　　No Vietnamese People's Army soldier who participated in the Dien Bien Phu campaign does not miss the *ban hoa* flower of Dien Bien Phu. This is not only because the *ban hoa* is beautiful, but also because the tree grows lush and strong, with thick bark, able to withstand the "test" of enemy napalm bombs. Imagine, on those hills scorched bare by napalm, the *ban hoa* tree, like the People's Army soldiers, stood firm and unyielding, budding and blooming as before. How could this not make the soldiers regard it as their best friend!

　　The *ban hoa*, a unique wild plant of the Da River area, is closely related to the lives of the Dien Bien Phu people. Before liberation, the *ban hoa* was a flower symbolizing suffering. Because every time it bloomed in the spring, it was the lean season, and the Dien Bien Phu people had to pick it to fill their stomachs. Now, the *ban hoa*, with its beautiful flowers, adorns people's happy lives even more beautifully.

　　The colonialism and feudalism of Dien Bien Phu were destroyed by the Vietnamese people more than four years ago, along with those bunkers flying the tricolor flag. Since then, the mountains and fields of Dien Bien Phu have undergone earth-shaking changes. The fertile fields on both sides of the Nam Rom River, the golden deer in the fields, and the delicious fruits all belong to the people. The people of all ethnic groups living here have been reborn and have begun to live a life of unity and friendship. The Xa people, who have long yearned for the fields, have now begun to come down from the mountains to learn farming from the Thai people. When the Miao people celebrate festivals, the Xue girls put on their national costumes and travel two days on mountain roads to congratulate them.

　　In this place where the sounds of bombs and machine guns echoed more than four years ago, the sound of children reading aloud now cheers. Every village in the Dien Bien Phu area has a school. More than one hundred classes of literacy schools for the masses have been opened. Many young people go to study at the Hanoi Mountainous Area Normal School. In the mountainous area, where infectious diseases were common and hygiene was poor in the past, there is now a health worker in every village. Seven shy Miao women have now learned midwifery.

　　At present, the Dien Bien Phu area, like other parts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, is busy with construction. This year, the rice field planting area here has increased from 70 *mau* last year to 170 *mau*. The People's Army soldiers who once fought on the battlefield are now busy surveying the land, preparing to build irrigation projects, and open farms and orchards. The day when every household can eat a large amount of mandarin oranges is not far away. (Attached image)

    奠边府的变迁
    参加过奠边府战役的越南人民军战士，没有一个不怀念奠边府的斑花的。这不单因为斑花美丽，而且因为斑花树长得葱郁粗壮，树皮坚厚，它经得起敌人的凝固汽油弹的“考验”。你想，在那被汽油弹烧得光秃秃的山岗，斑花树同人民军战士一样，坚贞不屈地照旧屹立在那儿，照旧结蕾开花，这怎能不让战士们把它看做最好的朋友呢！
    斑花，这种沱江一带特有的野生植物，同奠边府人民的生活有着密切的联系。解放前，斑花是一种象征痛苦的花朵。因为每当它盛开的春天，正是青黄不接的时候，奠边府人民要摘它来充饥。现在，斑花用它那美丽的花朵，把人们的幸福生活点缀得更漂亮了。
    奠边府的殖民主义和封建主义，在四年多以前，随着那些插着三色旗的碉堡一起被越南人民摧毁了。从此，奠边府的山野上起了翻天复地的变化。捻来江两岸的良田，原野上金黄色的小鹿，鲜美的水果，都已属于人民了。居住在这儿的各族人民，都得到了新生，开始过着团结友爱的生活。早就渴望着原野的舍族人民，今天已经开始下山来，向泰族人学习耕种。苗族人民欢庆节日时，雪族少女则穿上民族盛装，赶两天山路前去祝贺。
    在这片四年多以前响着炸弹声和机枪声的地方，如今却欢腾着孩子们的朗读声。奠边府地区每个村庄都有学校。民众识字学校已开了一百多个班级。不少青年到河内山区师范学校去读书了。过去传染病多、谈不上卫生条件的山区，如今每村都有一个卫生员。怕羞的苗族妇女，现在已有七个人学会了助产工作。
    目前，奠边府地区同越南民主共和国各地一样，正在紧张地忙于建设。今年这儿的稻田播种面积，已从去年的七十越亩增加到一百七十越亩。昔日驰骋战场的人民军战士们，现在正忙着勘测土地，准备修建灌溉工程，开辟农场和果园。家家户户都能吃到大量蜜柑的日子，已经不远了。（附图片）
