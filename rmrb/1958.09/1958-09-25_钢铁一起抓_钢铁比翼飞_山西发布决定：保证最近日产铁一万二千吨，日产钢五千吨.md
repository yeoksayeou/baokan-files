    Grasp Iron and Steel Together, Let Iron and Steel Soar Together
    Shanxi Issues Decision: Guarantee a Recent Daily Output of 12,000 Tons of Iron and 5,000 Tons of Steel
    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 24th) The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee issued on the 22nd the "Decision on Current Iron and Steel Production." This decision requires leading cadres in all regions to not only grasp iron production but also steel production, enabling iron and steel to leap forward together. It guarantees that by September 28th, the province's daily iron production level will reach 12,000 tons, striving for 15,000 tons, and the daily steel production level will reach approximately 5,000 tons.
    The decision states that since the Enlarged Meeting of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the situation in iron and steel production throughout the province has improved significantly due to a series of emergency measures taken in various regions. On the 21st, the province's daily iron output leaped from approximately 2,000 tons in the past to more than 5,000 tons. The daily iron output of Taiyuan City, Yangquan City, and Jincheng County all reached over 1,000 tons. A local furnace in the Nancun People's Commune of Jincheng County produced 100 tons of iron in four days, averaging 25 tons per day, setting the highest record for iron output from local furnaces nationwide. Faced with this new situation, as long as the leadership can keep up, conscientiously implement the instructions of the Central Political Bureau Enlarged Meeting on iron and steel production, closely rely on the masses, fully utilize all favorable conditions, and overcome difficulties in every possible way, it is entirely certain that the iron and steel production tasks can be completed and overfulfilled.
    The decision emphatically points out that in the next hundred days, September and October are critical moments of decisive battle. Therefore, in addition to continuing to focus on iron production, all iron and steel plants, machinery plants, repair plants, and key people's communes involved in iron smelting throughout the province, as well as all organs, organizations, and schools capable of steelmaking, are required to universally promote and create local methods of steelmaking, vigorously build small converters, open-hearth furnaces, and crucible furnaces, and greatly increase steel production, because the main purpose of iron smelting is to make steel.
    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 24th) Taiyuan City has taken effective measures to ensure the completion of the September steel production plan without a single ounce less.
    The measures decided upon by the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party are: 1. Vigorously promote oxygen steelmaking to increase steel production. Prioritize all units using oxygen, ensuring that key needs are met. 2. Immediately study and promote the method of direct oxygen blowing steelmaking using molten iron at the Mining Machinery Plant. 3. Vigorously develop small converters. All machinery manufacturing plants, repair shops in other factories and mines, technical schools, and units with cupola furnaces in the city will launch a crash program to manufacture and install thirty-five to forty small converters of about 0.5 cubic meters. 4. Concentrate all basic construction forces unrelated to iron and steel production and the construction forces of local enterprises on steelmaking. 5. All scrap steel products from enterprises, organs, and organizations throughout the city, including scrap machine tools, iron stoves, etc., will be immediately sent to units with steelmaking furnaces to be converted into molten steel. Various materials used in steelmaking will be balanced throughout the city to ensure that no steelmaking furnace is shut down waiting for materials. 6. Organize forces to engage in local open-hearth steelmaking. 7. Concentrate all technical and material resources in the city to help open-hearth furnaces "launch satellites" and achieve large-scale bumper harvests.

    钢铁一起抓  钢铁比翼飞
    山西发布决定：保证最近日产铁一万二千吨，日产钢五千吨
    本报太原24日电  中共山西省委、山西省人民委员会22日发布“关于当前钢铁生产的决定”。这个决定要求各地区领导干部当前不仅要抓铁，而且还要抓钢，使铁和钢双双跃进。保证到9月28日，全省铁的日产水平达到一万二千吨，争取一万五千吨，钢的日产水平达到五千吨左右。
    这个决定说，自从中共山西省委扩大会议以来，由于各地采取了一系列紧急措施，全省钢铁生产的形势有了显著的好转。21日，全省铁的日产量由过去的二千吨左右跃进到五千多吨，太原市、阳泉市和晋城县铁的日产量都达到千吨以上，晋城县南村人民公社的一座土方炉四天出铁一百吨，平均日产二十五吨，创造了全国土方炉出铁量的最高纪录。在这种新形势面前，只要领导能跟上去，认真地贯彻执行中央政治局扩大会议关于钢铁生产的指示，紧紧地依靠群众，充分利用各种有利条件，千方百计地克服困难，完成和超额完成钢铁生产任务是完全有把握的。
    决定着重指出，在今后一百天，9、10两月是带有决战性的时刻。因此除了继续抓紧铁的生产外，要求全省各钢铁厂、机械厂、修理厂和炼铁的重点人民公社，以及一切可能炼钢的机关、团体和学校，都要普遍推行和创造土法炼钢，大力建设小型的转炉、平炉、坩锅炉，大量增加钢的生产。因为炼铁的主要目的在于炼钢。
    本报太原24日电  太原市采取有力措施，保证不短一斤不少一两地完成9月份钢产量计划。
    中共太原市委决定采取的措施是：一、大搞氧气炼钢，增加钢产量。对所有使用氧气的单位进行排队，保证重点需要。二、立即研究和推行矿山机器厂用铁水泡直接吹氧炼钢的方法。三、大搞小转炉。全市所有机械制造厂、其它厂矿的机修车间、技术学校以及有化铁炉的单位突击制造和安装零点五立方左右的小转炉三十五个到四十个。四、把所有同钢铁生产无关的基本建设施工力量和地方企业的建筑力量，都集中起来搞炼钢。五、全市各企业、机关、团体所有的废钢铁产品，包括废机床、铁火炉等，立即送到有炼钢炉的单位化成钢水。炼钢所使用的各种材料在全市范围内平衡，保证不让一个炼钢炉停工待料。六、组织力量搞土平炉炼钢。七、集中全市所有技术、材料力量帮助平炉放卫星，搞大面积丰产。
