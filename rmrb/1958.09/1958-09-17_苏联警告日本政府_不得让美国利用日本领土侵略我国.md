Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Soviet Embassy in Japan Counselor Adirkhaev visited Japanese Foreign Ministry European and African Affairs Bureau Director Kanayama Masae this morning and handed the Japanese Foreign Ministry an unsigned memorandum from the Soviet government regarding the issue of the United States armed forces using Japanese territory to carry out provocative activities against China.

Counselor Adirkhaev announced the main content of this unsigned memorandum at a press conference held this afternoon.

The memorandum stated that recently, the United States government has carried out a series of provocative and dangerous actions against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan area and increased military forces in the Taiwan Strait area. These actions by the United States have sharpened the situation in the Far East and seriously threatened world peace.

The memorandum listed many reports showing that the United States armed forces are directly using Japanese territory to carry out its provocative and aggressive actions, and the Japanese government is well aware of these facts.

The memorandum stated that if these reports are true, then Japan will wittingly or unwittingly become an accomplice to the United States' aggressive actions.

The memorandum said that the Soviet government is far from believing that Japan and the Japanese people are willing to become accomplices to the aforementioned aggressive actions of the United States. However, the Soviet government cannot ignore the aforementioned reports that the Japanese government has not denied. The Soviet government hopes that the Japanese government will calmly assess the situation and take appropriate measures to prevent the United States armed forces from potentially using Japanese territory to carry out aggressive actions.

According to Kyodo News, the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued an opinion on the Soviet government's memorandum tonight, stating that it does not recognize the fact that Japan is helping the United States carry out aggression. It also defended the United States' aggressive behavior, insisting that the Soviet Union's determination in the memorandum that the United States' actions in the Taiwan Strait are aggression is "unfounded." Furthermore, it reversed black and white by falsely accusing (China of) "attempts to use force to change the status quo," which "could pose a threat to world peace."

However, in order to cope with domestic and foreign public opinion and the opposition of the Japanese people, it had to express that the Japanese government "urgently hopes that the Taiwan Strait crisis can be resolved in the peace talks currently being held in Warsaw."

    苏联警告日本政府
    不得让美国利用日本领土侵略我国
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：苏联驻日本大使馆参赞阿迪尔哈耶夫今天上午到日本外务省访问欧非局局长金山政英，把苏联政府关于美国武装力量利用日本领土对中国进行挑衅活动问题的一份不署名备忘录交给日本外务省。
    阿迪尔哈耶夫参赞在今天下午举行的记者招待会上公布了这项不署名备忘录的主要内容。
    备忘录说，最近，美国政府在台湾地区对中华人民共和国进行了一系列的挑衅的危险行动，并在台湾海峡地区增加军事力量。美国的这些行动使远东局势尖锐化，并且使世界和平受到严重威胁。
    备忘录列举许多消息表明，美国武装力量直接利用日本领土来进行它的挑衅和侵略行动，这些事实是日本政府知道得很清楚的。
    备忘录说，如果这些消息属实，那么，日本就会有意无意地成为美国侵略行动的同伙。
    备忘录说，苏联政府远不认为日本和日本人民愿意成为美国的上述侵略行动的同伙。但是苏联政府对于日本政府没有否认的上述消息不能置之不理。苏联政府希望日本政府冷静地对局势作出估计，并且采取适当的办法，以便防止美国武装力量有可能使用日本领土来进行侵略行动。
    据共同社透露，日本外务省在今天晚上对苏联政府的备忘录发表意见时，表示不承认日本帮助美国进行侵略的事实。它还为美国的侵略行为辩解，硬说苏联在备忘录中断定美国在台湾海峡的行动是侵略这一点“缺乏根据”。并且颠倒黑白地诬蔑（中国）“想要使用武力来改变现状的尝试”，“都有可能形成对世界和平的威胁”。
    但是，它为了应付国内外舆论和日本人民的反对，也不得不表示日本政府“迫切希望台湾海峡危机能够在目前正在华沙举行的和平谈判中获得解决”。
