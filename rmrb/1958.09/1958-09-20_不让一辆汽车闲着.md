Don't Let a Single Car Sit Idle
By People's Daily Commentator

Currently, many regions across the country are experiencing a growing shortage of transportation capacity and a backlog of goods awaiting shipment. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in road transport. From January to August, the national road freight volume increased by 51.5% compared to the same period last year, but only 39% of the annual Great Leap Forward plan was completed. There are still 110 million tons of goods, 60% more than the amount transported from January to August, to be transported in the remaining four months. Preliminary calculations show that the existing vehicles in the highway transport sector, plus the potentially added new vehicles, can only complete over 74 million tons. If prompt and effective emergency measures are not taken, the remaining 37 million tons of freight task will be difficult to complete.

However, in contrast to the tight road transport situation, the transportation potential of freight vehicles in many administrative organs and enterprises across the country is still very large, and this potential has not yet been fully utilized. As of the end of the first half of this year, there were approximately 50,000 freight vehicles in national administrative organs and enterprises, most of which were new and in good condition, exceeding the total number of vehicles in the highway transport sector by 25%. The performance of these vehicles is also superior to those in the highway transport sector. However, because these vehicles are used in a decentralized manner, operating independently, with uneven workloads, and poor management, their transportation efficiency is very low, less than 50% of that of the highway transport sector. The vehicle efficiency of administrative organs, organizations, and cultural and educational departments is even lower, only about 25% of that of the highway transport sector.

During the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, have the administrative organs and enterprises become too busy with their own transportation tasks to spare any capacity? No. Evidence from typical investigation materials in various places proves that there is still great potential in these vehicles. The example of Tianjin's organization and utilization of freight vehicles from administrative organs and enterprises to solve the problem of insufficient transport capacity and backlog of materials, published in today's newspaper, has achieved great results and serves as a good example. Under the unified leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee, Tianjin has broken down departmentalism and carried out transport cooperation, having already organized and utilized about 50% of the freight vehicles from administrative organs and enterprises. After organization and utilization, vehicle efficiency increased by 1.3 times. If all regions across the country did as Tianjin did, fully utilizing the freight vehicles of administrative organs and enterprises, it could at least make up for 60%-70% of the transport capacity shortfall in highway transport in the last four months of this year, and the current tense situation in highway transport would be greatly alleviated.

Fully organizing and utilizing the freight vehicles of administrative organs and enterprises is a complex task. The reason why this part of the vehicles has not been fully mobilized in the past is mainly because the leaders and managers of many administrative organs and enterprises have many concerns, fearing that they will not be able to complete their own transportation tasks, that it will be inconvenient to use the vehicles, that the assigned goods will not be good, and that the vehicles will be damaged. Now, Tianjin's experience proves that as long as the local Party committee provides unified leadership, gives priority to political considerations, and actively organizes transport cooperation, these concerns can be completely eliminated. This is a direct and effective method that does not require the state to spend money and can produce immediate results, and it should be vigorously promoted everywhere.

In addition, the number of freight vehicles owned by the national armed forces is also very large, and the use of these vehicles is similar to that of the freight vehicles of organs and enterprises. If they appropriately participate in transportation without affecting military needs, they will play a greater role in overcoming the current shortage of highway transport capacity and changing the situation of material backlog. We hope that the troops stationed throughout the country will quickly take action and put all the vehicles that can be deployed into the economic construction front.

    不让一辆汽车闲着
    本报评论员
    目前，全国很多地区都出现了运输能力不足，物资积压待运的步步紧张现象。这种现象在汽车运输方面更为突出。1至8月份全国汽车货运量虽较去年同期增长51.5％，但仅完成年度跃进计划的39％，还有一亿一千万吨物资，即比1至8月份多60％的货运任务要在后四个月中完成。初步计算：公路运输部门现有的车辆，加上可能增加的新车在内，只能完成七千四百多万吨。如果不迅速采取紧急有效的措施，余下的三千七百万吨货运任务是难于完成的。
    但是，与公路运输紧张情况相反的是全国很多行政机关和企业单位货运汽车的运输潜力仍然很大，这些潜力至今还没有被充分利用起来。到今年上半年末，全国国家机关、企业单位货运汽车数量约有五万辆，其中大部分是新车、好车，比公路运输部门的全部车辆还多25％，车辆性能也优于公路运输部门的汽车。但是，由于这部分汽车是分散使用的，各自单干，忙闲不均，管理不善，因此车辆运输效率很低，尚不及公路运输部门的50％。其中行政机关、团体、文教部门的车辆效率更低，仅达公路运输部门的25％左右。
    在工农业生产大跃进中，行政机关、企业单位本身运输任务增加，是不是自顾不暇，没有什么潜力可挖了呢？不是。从各地典型调查材料证明，这部分车辆仍存在很大的潜力。今天本报发表的天津市组织利用行政机关、企业单位货运汽车，解决运力不足物资积压的问题，取得了很大的成绩，就是一个很好的例子。天津市在中共天津市委和市人民委员会的统一领导下，打破本位主义思想、开展运输协作，已经组织利用了行政机关、企业单位50％左右的货运汽车。组织利用后，车辆效率提高了一点三倍。如果全国各地都像天津市这样做，把行政机关、企业单位的货运汽车充分利用起来，在今年最后四个月里至少能弥补公路运输所缺运力的60％—70％，目前公路运输的紧张局势，将得到很大的缓和。
    充分组织利用行政机关、企业单位的货运汽车，是一件复杂的工作。过去所以没有把这部分车辆充分调动起来，主要是由于很多行政机关、企业单位的领导人员和管理人员存在着很多顾虑，怕完不成自己的运输任务，怕用车不方便，怕配的货不好，怕把车搞坏等。现在天津市的经验证明，只要在当地党委统一领导下，政治挂帅，积极组织运输协作，这些顾虑是完全可以消除的。这是一个不需要国家花钱，就可以立即收效的立竿见影的办法，各地应该雷厉风行地加以推广。
    此外，目前全国部队所有的货运汽车也是很多的，这部分车辆的使用情况与机关、企业的货运汽车相仿。如果在不影响军事需要的情况下，适当地参加运输，对克服当前公路运输运力不足的困难，改变物资积压的状况，将会发挥更大的作用。我们希望驻在全国各地的部队，很快地行动起来，把能够抽调出来的汽车，都投到经济建设战线上去。
