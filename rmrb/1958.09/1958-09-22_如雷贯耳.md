    Like Thunder in the Ears
    Zang Kejia

    --After reading Foreign Minister Chen Yi's stern warning to Dulles
    Dulles, millions of fingers are pointing at you! Your glib tongue cannot overturn the ironclad facts: Taiwan, Kinmen, and Matsu are ours, ours, and forever ours!
    We still remember you crouching on the "38th parallel" with that bandit-like stare, followed by a surprise attack on Korea, and then falsely accusing the Korean and Chinese volunteers, all the while uttering sanctimonious words.
    Your invading troops came from tens of thousands of miles away, reaching our territorial waters, and you again used the old trick of dragging your feet, falsely accusing us of using force. Eight serious warnings, yet you pretended not to hear them, your response was threats, intimidation, and the dispatch of troops.
    The Chinese people love peace, but the Chinese people are not to be trifled with! We respect the territory of others, but we will not give up an inch of our own! The Chinese people have friends all over the world, and we have fired salutes to welcome friendly visiting fleets; but to the arrogant aggressors, we are strong iron men, as our nearly hundred-year history is the best proof.
    We will not forget the sins committed by the American aggressors in the past, Marshall, Hurley... the masters and accomplices of Chiang Kai-shek, your bestial soldiers rampaged on our land, and the crimes of insulting the Chinese people happened one after another...
    In the past, we had the strength to overthrow the traitors and drive away the invaders. Today, our strength is multiplied a thousandfold, and the sun overhead shines on a strong new China!
    The cause of justice is not lonely. Behind us is the entire socialist camp. "To invade China is to invade the Soviet Union," Khrushchev has again issued a warning.
    The solemn warning is like thunder in the ears, Dulles, it is impossible to cover your ears! Every Chinese is a strong fighter, see if you dare to move, the Taiwan area will be a new Shangganling!

    如雷贯耳
    臧克家
    ——读了陈毅外长严正警告杜勒斯的声明以后杜勒斯，千万只手指着你！三寸烂舌头翻不了铁的事实：台湾、金门、马祖是我们的，是我们的，永远是我们的！我们还记得你伏在“三八线”
  上那强盗式的窥视，接着向朝鲜发动了突击，反过来诬赖朝鲜和中国志愿军，你口里还振振有词。你们的侵略军从万里外开来，开到我们的领海，你又施出了拖着长尾巴的故技，反过来诬蔑我们使用武力。八次的严重警告，却假装没有听真，你们作出的回答，是威胁吓诈遣将调兵。中国人民热爱和平，中国人民决不可欺！我们尊重别人的领土，自己的领土一寸也不放弃！中国人民好朋友天下驰名，曾鸣过礼炮向来作友好访问的舰队表示欢迎；对于蛮横的侵略者却是坚强的铁汉，一部近百年史就是最好的证明。我们忘不了美国侵略者过去犯下的罪孽，马歇尔、赫尔利……蒋介石的主子和帮凶，你们的兽兵在我们的土地上横冲乱撞，侮辱中国人民的罪行一件又一件发生……过去，我们有力量打倒卖国贼，赶走侵略者，今天，我们的力量千万倍，头顶上的太阳照着一个强大的新中国！正义的事业不孤单，我们背后是整个社会主义阵营，“侵略中国就是侵略苏联”，赫鲁晓夫再度发出了警告声。严正的警告如雷贯耳，杜勒斯，想掩起耳朵也不可能！每个中国人就是一个坚强的战士，看你敢动，台湾地区就是新的甘岭！　　　　9月21日午
