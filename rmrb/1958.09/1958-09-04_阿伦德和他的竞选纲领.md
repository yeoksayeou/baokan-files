　　Allende and His Platform
    In recent months, all progressive forces in Chile have united around the Popular Action Front, waging an intense struggle to secure the victory of "People's Candidate" Allende in the presidential election.
    Dr. Allende is a leader of the Chilean Socialist Party and chairman of the Popular Action Front. The Chilean Popular Action Front nominated Allende as its presidential candidate at the "People's Convention for the Presidential Election" held in September 1957. Three thousand representatives from all over Chile attended this meeting. It was a truly people's convention. Participating in the convention were not only parties from the Popular Action Front, but also the Radical Party, leaders of the United Workers' Confederation of Chile, and representatives of workers, farmers, university students, professors, intellectuals, and women.
    At this convention, a campaign platform reflecting the fundamental aspirations of the Chilean people was unanimously adopted. This platform, supported by the Communist Party, includes the following main points:
    I. National Independence—The platform emphasizes that national sovereignty must be respected first and foremost, rejecting the dictates of imperialism in order to maintain the independence of the republic; and on this basis, implementing a foreign policy of peace and maintaining friendly relations with the people of all countries.
    II. Democracy—The platform emphasizes that the Chilean people must, in accordance with democratic principles, hold the reins of national leadership in their own hands. To achieve this goal, it calls for the abolition of the so-called "Law for the Defense of Democracy" (note: this law was abolished in early August) and all other decrees that suppress and discriminate against patriotic and democratic forces; the realization of constitutional reform to fully restore public freedoms and trade union rights, and the abolition of states of emergency; it advocates expanding suffrage to grant all Chileans over the age of eighteen the right to vote; it demands that responsibility and power be equally handed over to the direct representatives of the people throughout the country.
    III. Economic Development—The platform proposes that Chile's economy must be developed and modernized; opposes a begging attitude towards foreign capital, and advocates that the state, representing the interests and aspirations of the people, should assume the responsibility for planning and promoting Chile's economic activities to promote national development and prosperity. The platform advocates eliminating the monopoly structures that hinder Chile's industrial development, and incorporating Chile's copper and nitrate mines into the national economy, protecting the ownership and national exploitation rights of oil, uranium, and general power resources. In agriculture, it advocates eliminating feudal large estate production methods and ownership.
    IV. Welfare—The platform proposes measures to improve and raise the welfare of the Chilean people, advocating the abolition of all price freeze decrees, adapting wages and pensions to the level of actual living expenses, while implementing extensive construction plans to eliminate the phenomenon of housing shortage in the shortest possible period.
    Because the current President Ibáñez implements policies that succumb to U.S. monopoly capital, leading to a serious deterioration of the Chilean economy and increasing impoverishment of the people's lives, the Chilean people urgently demand the establishment of a democratic, anti-imperialist, and anti-feudal government. Allende's campaign platform is in line with this demand of the Chilean people, and therefore has gained the support of an increasingly powerful people's movement. (Zhang)

　　阿伦德和他的竞选纲领
    最近几个月以来，智利一切进步力量都团结在人民行动阵线周围，为争取“人民候选人”阿伦德在总统选举中获胜进行着紧张的斗争。
    阿伦德博士是智利社会党领导人和人民行动阵线的主席。智利人民行动阵线在1957年9月间举行的“总统选举人民协议会”上推选阿伦德为总统候选人。参加这次会议的有来自智利各地的三千名代表。这是一次真正的人民大会。参加协议会的不仅有人民行动阵线的各个党派，还有激进党、全智利统一工人工会领袖和工人、农民、大学生、教授、知识分子、妇女界的代表人物。
    在这次大会上一致通过了反映智利人民基本愿望的竞选纲领。这个纲领获得了共产党的支持，主要内容如下：
    一、民族独立——纲领强调指出，民族主权必须首先得到尊重，拒绝帝国主义的命令，以保持共和国的独立；并且在这个基础上执行和平和同世界各国人民保持友好关系的外交政策。
    二、民主——纲领强调指出，智利人民必须按照民主原则，把国家的领导权掌握在自己的手里。为达到这个目的，要求废除所谓“保卫民主法”（按：这个法律已经在8月初被废除）以及其他一切镇压和歧视爱国民主力量的法令；实现宪法改革，从而完全恢复公众自由和工会权利，取消非常状态；主张扩大选举权，给所有年满十八岁的智利人以选举权；要求在全国范围内把责任和权力同等地交给人民的直接代表。
    三、经济发展——纲领提出必须发展智利的经济并使它现代化；反对对外国资本抱乞求的态度，主张应由代表人民利益和愿望的国家担负起计划和推动智利经济活动的责任，以促进国家的发展和繁荣。纲领主张消除阻碍智利工业发展的垄断结构，并且把智利的铜矿和硝石矿纳入国家经济中，保卫石油、铀和一般动力资源的所有权和国家开采权。在农业方面，主张消除封建的大庄园制生产方法和所有制。
    四、生活福利——纲领提出改善和提高智利人民生活福利的措施，主张废除一切物价冻结的法令，使工资和抚恤金适应实际生活费用的水平，同时实行广泛的建筑计划，争取在最短期间内消除住房奇缺的现象。
    由于现任总统伊巴?斯执行屈从美国垄断资本的政策，导致智利经济严重恶化，人民生活日益贫困，智利人民迫切要求成立一个民主、反帝和反封建的政府。阿伦德的竞选纲领符合于智利人民的这种要求，因而获得了日益强大的人民运动的支持。　（章）
