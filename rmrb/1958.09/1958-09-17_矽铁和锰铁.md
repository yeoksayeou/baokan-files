    Silicon Iron and Ferromanganese

    I. Uses of Silicon Iron and Ferromanganese:
    Silicon iron and ferromanganese are both raw materials used in steelmaking. To give steel the required chemical composition and mechanical properties, a certain amount of silicon iron and ferromanganese generally needs to be added to the molten steel. Because the elements silicon and manganese have a strong binding force with the harmful gas – oxygen – in the molten steel, they can eliminate oxygen in the steel. In this sense, silicon iron and ferromanganese are deoxidizers for steelmaking. Silicon iron and ferromanganese can also be used to adjust the chemical composition of molten steel to achieve the required silicon and manganese content and obtain certain mechanical properties. From this perspective, silicon iron and ferromanganese are also alloying agents for steelmaking. Another use is to adjust the composition of molten iron. In particular, white cast iron produced by native blast furnaces needs to be transformed into gray cast iron for casting, which requires the addition of some silicon iron during melting. Silicon iron and only a small amount of ferromanganese can be used only when producing rimmed steel (which is a steel that is not completely deoxidized).

    II. What are Silicon Iron and Ferromanganese:
    Silicon iron is an alloy of two elements: silicon and iron. There are many types of silicon iron used in steelmaking, with silicon content ranging from 9% to 95%. Silicon iron with a silicon content of 15% or less is smelted in blast furnaces, using natural silica (i.e., quartz), coke, and iron ore as raw materials. Silicon iron smelted in electric furnaces contains 45% to 95% silicon, using natural silica, coke (or charcoal, petroleum coke, anthracite) and steel scrap as raw materials. The higher the silicon content of silicon iron, the greater its power consumption during electric furnace smelting. Silicon iron produced in blast furnaces is cheaper and can be used as a deoxidizer and to adjust the composition of molten iron. Silicon iron produced in electric furnaces with a silicon content of 75% or more should only be used as an alloying agent for making silicon steel and certain special steels. For other general steel types, using silicon iron with a silicon content of 45% is more economical and reasonable.

    Ferromanganese is an alloy of two elements: manganese and iron. There are also many types of ferromanganese, with a manganese content generally above 70%, but ferromanganese with a manganese content below 70% can also be used. Ferromanganese can be smelted in blast furnaces or electric furnaces, using manganese ore and coke as raw materials (steel scrap is also required for electric furnace smelting). Ferromanganese produced in blast furnaces has a high carbon content. Electric furnaces should be used to produce ferromanganese with a low carbon content, which is only used when making steel with a very low carbon content.

    矽铁和锰铁
    一、矽铁和锰铁的用途：
    矽铁和锰铁都是炼钢用的原料。为了使钢具有要求的化学成份和机械性能，一般地在钢水中需要加入一定量的矽铁和锰铁。由于矽和锰这两种元素和钢水中的有害气体——氧，有较强的结合力，所以它们可以消除钢中的氧，从这个意义上讲，矽铁和锰铁是炼钢用的脱氧剂。矽铁和锰铁也可以用来调整钢水中的化学成份，达到所要求的含矽量和含锰量，得到一定的机械性能，从这个意义上来讲，矽铁和锰铁又是炼钢用的合金剂。还有一种用途是用于调整铁水的成份，特别是土高炉炼出的白口铁要把它变成铸造用的灰口铁，就需要在熔化时加入些矽铁。只有在生产沸腾钢（它是一种脱氧不完全的钢）时，才可以不用矽铁和只用少量的锰铁。
    二、什么是矽铁和锰铁：
    矽铁是矽和铁两种元素的合金。炼钢用的矽铁有很多种，它的含矽量在9％—95％。含矽15％以下的是用高炉炼制的，其所用原料是天然矽石（即石英石），焦炭和铁矿石。电炉所炼的矽铁含矽在45％—95％，所用原料是天然矽石，焦炭（或木炭、石油焦炭、无烟煤均可）和钢屑。矽铁含矽量愈高，在电炉冶炼时它的耗电量愈大。高炉生产的矽铁成本比较便宜，可用做脱氧剂和调整铁水成份之用，电炉生产的含矽75％以上的矽铁只应做为炼制矽钢和某些特殊钢种的合金剂，其它一般钢种可以用含矽45％的矽铁较为经济合理。
    锰铁是锰和铁两种元素的合金。锰铁也有许多种，其含锰量一般都在70％以上，含锰低于70％的也可以使用。锰铁可以在高炉或电炉中炼制，其所用原料为锰矿石，焦炭（电炉冶炼时还要用钢屑）。高炉生产的锰铁含炭较高。应该用电炉来生产含炭较低的锰铁，这种锰铁仅在炼制含炭很低的钢时使用。
