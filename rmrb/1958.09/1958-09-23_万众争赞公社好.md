The Masses Praise the Commune's Goodness

In mid-September, in Jinci Town, a suburb of Taiyuan City on the banks of the Fen River, the autumn sky was clear and the air was crisp. The great leap forward presented a harvest scene like a painting, filled everywhere with the songs of peasants praising the people's commune. A widely circulated clapper rhyme goes like this:

	The commune is like a great red pine, unafraid of storms or wind;
	Thousands of families unite as one, surpassing Jinci's "Evergreen Pine."
	The commune is like the "Hard-to-Age Spring," one generation's toil, ten thousand generations' sweetness;
	The spring water irrigates eight thousand hectares, the commune benefits the people for ten thousand years.

This clapper rhyme was composed by commune members Zhao Shuangquan and others from the Leap Forward People's Commune. Commune members told reporters that this clapper rhyme uses the past to illuminate the present, with deep emotional content.

Jinci is one of Shanxi's famous scenic spots, and the large pine tree and "Hard-to-Age Spring" are famous ancient sites among its eight scenic wonders. For many years, the people here have regarded these two sights as symbols of eternity, using them to describe things they want to last forever. But this time, when using them to praise the people's commune, the commune members felt it was somewhat insufficient, and added:

	Pine and cypress longevity always ends, even the most abundant spring can stop;
	Hard to compare with the commune, one generation lays the foundation, ten thousand generations take root.

In rural areas across Shanxi, while celebrating the establishment of people's communes, the entire province has now realized people's communization. In the past, Shanxi peasants, known for "speaking in chapters and rhyming in conversation" when praising past social movements and describing the new countryside, are now widely popular in praising people's communes. Clapper rhymes, strings of words, and doggerels are emerging like a swarm of bees, and new Shanxi tunes, new ditties, and new folk songs are sung everywhere.

Farmers in the Taihang Mountain area of Changzhi describe the people's commune as "the road to paradise (communism)":

	Communism is paradise, the people's commune builds the bridge;
	Walking along the sunny avenue, step by step into paradise.
	Since ancient times, it has been said that paradise is good, but it is vague and nowhere to be found;
	Now there is a road to paradise, and the joy on earth surpasses "Lingxiao (heaven)."

In the past, there was a common saying in Hongzhao County, southern Shanxi: "Gold treasures, silver treasures, are indispensable for a person's life." After the establishment of people's communes, the peasants added a sequel to this sentence, saying: "Now that we have the great commune, these things are not worth mentioning." They said that the people's commune is the real treasure that benefits the peasants, specifically listing the benefits of the commune:

	The people's commune has many advantages, it is more superior than the agricultural cooperative;
	Industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military are closely integrated, with many comprehensive production projects.
	Commune-run industries are guaranteed, repairing machines without leaving the village;
	Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, comprehensive development and leap forward together.
	Various schools are run by the commune, cultivating talents who are both red and expert;
	Marketing and supply institutions are more common, making production and life more convenient.

In Lizhuang Village, Wanrong County, when promoting the establishment of people's communes, some well-to-do middle peasants claimed that joining the commune was "Liu Bei recruiting a son-in-law, the outcome is uncertain." Poor peasant commune member Zhou Yongkang posted a big-character poster in response to this statement, saying:

	In the past, suffering was said to be fate, not knowing that people were exploiting people;
	The land reform lifted the big stone slab, and thousand-year-old dead branches sprouted.
	Mutual aid teams, entered the door, elementary cooperatives, took root,
	Advanced cooperatives, great leap forward, the people's commune soars again.
	That bitterness, that sweetness, who cries hardship, who is happy;
	Everyone thinks, everyone sees, true gold fears no fire.

This big-character poster played a great role. Many peasants used their personal experiences to powerfully expose the wealthy middle peasants who were speaking ill of the commune, dispelling the concerns of some commune members and actively preparing to join the commune.

During the days of celebrating the people's communization, peasants everywhere never forgot to thank the Party and Chairman Mao for their wise leadership. Commune members of the Leap Forward People's Commune in the suburbs of Taiyuan City said:

	The commune is like a mountain of treasures, all kinds of treasures are complete,
	The Party gives us guidance, and everyone works hard to open mountains and extract treasures.
	Flowers of happiness bloom in the commune, the Party brings us happiness,
	Peasants want to go to university, how can this be separated from Chairman Mao.

### 万众争赞公社好

    万众争赞公社好
    9月中旬，汾河畔太原市郊晋祠镇秋高气爽，大跃进丰收景象如画，到处洋溢着农民赞美人民公社的歌声。传播较广的有这样一段快板诗：
        公社好比大红松，不怕暴雨不怕风；
        千家万户合一起，赛过晋祠“不老松。”
        公社好比“难老泉”，一代辛苦万代甜；
        泉水浇地八千顷，公社益民万万年。
    这段快板诗是跃进人民公社社员赵双全等编的，社员们对记者说，这段快板诗引古论今内容情长意深。
    晋祠是山西名胜之一，大松树、“难老泉”是八景中有名的古迹。多少年来这里的人们把这两景看作是永恒的象征，用它来形容愿意永世长存的事物。但是这次用它来赞扬人民公社的时候，社员们总觉得有些不足，又补充说：
        松柏寿长总有尽，泉水再旺也能停；
        难与公社等量论，一代扎下万代根。
    山西农村各地与晋祠欢庆建立人民公社的同时，目前全省已实现了人民公社化，过去赞扬历次社会运动和描绘新农村以“出口成章、说话成韵”负有声誉的山西农民，现在赞美人民公社也普遍风行。快板诗、串串话、顺口溜蜂涌出现，新山曲、新小调、新民歌遍地歌颂。
    太行山长治地区农民们形容人民公社是“通向天堂（共产主义）的路”：
        共产主义是天堂，人民公社架桥梁；
        顺着阳关大道走，一步一步进天堂。
        自古都说天堂好，可是渺茫无处找；
        如今天堂有了路，人间欢乐胜“凌霄”。
    晋南洪赵县民间过去有句俗话是：“金财宝、银财宝，为人在世离不了”。办起人民公社以后农民们为这句话添了个续句说：“如今有了大公社，这些东西何足道”。他们说人民公社才是农民真正的造福宝，具体数说公社的好处是：
        人民公社好处多，它比农业社更优越；
        工农商学兵紧结合，综合生产项目多。
        社办工业有保证，修配机器不出村；
        农林牧副和渔业，全面发展齐跃进。
        各种学校公社办，培养人材红又专；
        供销机构更普遍，生产生活越方便。
    万荣县里庄村在宣传办人民公社时，有几个富裕中农扬言说，参加公社是“刘备招亲，吉凶难定”，贫农社员周永康针对这种说法出了一张大字报，里边说：
        过去受苦说是命，不知人在剥削人；
        土改揭掉大石板，千年枯枝把芽生。
        互助组、入了门，初级社、扎下根，
        高级社、大跃进，人民公社又高升。
        那个辛酸那个甜，谁们叫苦谁喜欢；
        大家想、大家看，真金不怕火来炼。
    这张大字报起了很大作用，许多农民用现身说法，有力地揭穿了说坏话的富裕中农，解除了一部分社员的顾虑，积极准备参加公社。
    各地农民在欢庆人民公社化的日子里，念念不忘地感激党和毛主席的英明领导。太原市郊跃进人民公社社员们说：
        公社好比万宝山，各种宝贝样样全，
        党给咱们来指点，开山取宝大家干。
        幸福花儿公社开，党给咱带得幸福来，
        农民要把大学上，这与毛主席怎分开。		·本报记者　杨　义·
