Strive for Rapid Development of the Aluminum Smelting Industry
By Renmin Ribao Commentator

Like copper, the current production of aluminum is far from meeting the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. It has become a weak link in the current comprehensive and rapid development of the national economy. Therefore, how to take effective measures to rapidly develop China's aluminum smelting industry is a problem that must be given attention by the whole Party. However, on the current development of China's aluminum smelting industry, some people still have superstitions, believing that aluminum smelting technology is complex, unlike steelmaking and ironmaking, which can be done on a small and indigenous scale. To smelt aluminum, one must go for the large and foreign.

Is this really the case? The construction experience of the Beijing Electrolytic Aluminum Plant has given this erroneous argument a head-on blow. It proves that using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to run aluminum smelting plants is a way to develop China's aluminum smelting industry in a faster, better, and more economical way. Of course, modern large-scale aluminum smelting plants have many advantages, such as large output and high technology. This is necessary, and China is also building such large-scale aluminum smelting plants. However, the construction of such factories requires a relatively long time and a large amount of investment, as well as a lot of modern equipment. If we place all our hopes on these large-scale aluminum smelting plants, this will not only fail to meet the urgent requirements of China's booming industry for aluminum, but also be beyond the reach of many places.

Small aluminum smelting plants of the Beijing Electrolytic Aluminum Plant type have many advantages over large and foreign aluminum plants. The factory is small and the construction speed is fast. Aluminum can be obtained in about a month, which is impossible for large factories. In today's aluminum smelting, where only electrolysis can be used, how to solve the power supply for aluminum is an important key issue. A large-scale aluminum smelting plant with an annual output of 25,000 tons of aluminum requires 58,000 kilowatts of electricity, while a small aluminum smelting plant with an annual output of about 1,000 tons of aluminum only needs more than 2,000 kilowatts of electricity. Many places can solve such a small amount of electricity by building their own small power stations. The construction of small power stations is not only fast, but also easier to solve the problem of power generation equipment than large power stations.

The old rules of building aluminum smelting plants requiring a large amount of steel and carbon bricks have been broken by the Beijing Aluminum Plant by using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. They don't use steel bars for building the factory buildings, and there are no cranes in the factory buildings. Even the electrolytic cells, which are the most important part of the aluminum smelting plant, are made of ordinary gray bricks instead of steel. The construction of electrolytic cells requires carbon bricks, but currently there is only one factory in China that produces carbon bricks, and the output is small and cannot meet the needs. According to the ideas of those who are superstitious about large and foreign things, if there are few carbon bricks, one can only wait until more carbon bricks are produced before building aluminum smelting plants. If this is done, the development speed of China's aluminum smelting industry will be like a snail walking, leaving it far behind the entire national economy. The Beijing Electrolytic Aluminum Plant uses carbon paste made from the raw materials for making carbon bricks instead of carbon bricks, which solves the major problem of the lack of carbon bricks for building a large number of aluminum smelting plants. The preparation of carbon paste is not difficult and is much easier than manufacturing carbon bricks, which provides ample possibilities for various places to quickly build aluminum smelting plants.

Because the factory is small and adopts a combination of indigenous and foreign methods for construction, saving a lot of valuable materials, its investment is naturally small, and the local governments can completely build such aluminum smelting plants on their own without the need for state investment.

Due to our lack of a foundation in the aluminum smelting industry, the shortage of technical personnel is a major problem in rapidly developing the aluminum smelting industry. If such aluminum plants are universally established throughout the country, a large number of engineering and technical personnel and workers in the aluminum smelting industry can quickly grow up through the training of these factories in a short period of time, which will create extremely favorable conditions for the further development of China's aluminum smelting industry.

From this, it seems that this small-scale, indigenous and foreign-combined aluminum smelting plant not only produces aluminum quickly, with immediate economic benefits, but also requires less money, saves steel, consumes little electricity, and has relatively simple technology, so it can be established everywhere. It has found a way to rapidly develop China's aluminum smelting industry.

Now, good news is frequently reported on the steel front, which is exciting and encouraging. The development of the iron and steel industry means that there is more steel, which promotes the development of machinery and other industries, and the development of the machinery industry requires a large amount of aluminum. Therefore, the aluminum smelting industry must quickly follow after the iron and steel industry. Otherwise, not only will the further development of machinery and other industries be affected, but also the development of the entire national economy will be affected. Party committees and governments at all levels should attach importance to the construction experience of the Beijing Electrolytic Aluminum Plant, and earnestly implement the方針 of combining indigenous and foreign methods, combining large, medium and small, and focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises in the aluminum smelting industry. Now, while vigorously grasping steel production to ensure complete victory on the entire front, we should immediately grasp aluminum production and basic construction work, and make a great leap forward in the aluminum smelting industry, so that aluminum, the deputy commander, can quickly rise to the account, so as to ensure the comprehensive and rapid development of China's national economy.

    力争快速发展炼铝工业
    本报评论员
    铝和铜一样，目前它的生产量远远不能满足工农业大跃进的需求。它已成为当前国民经济全面迅速发展中的薄弱一环。因此，如何采取有效措施快速发展我国炼铝工业，是当前必须引起全党注意的问题。但是，在目前发展我国的炼铝工业上，还有些人存在着迷信，认为炼铝技术复杂，不像炼钢炼铁，可以搞小的搞土的，要炼铝就必须搞大的搞洋的。
    果真如此么？北京电解铝厂的建设经验，恰恰又给这种错误的论调以无情一击。它证明用土洋结合的方法来办炼铝工厂，倒是多快好省地发展我国炼铝工业的一个途径。当然，现代化的大型炼铝工厂好处很多，如产量大、技术高等等，这是必需的，我国也正在建设这种大型炼铝工厂。但要建设这种工厂，需要比较长的时间和大量的投资，也需要很多现代化设备。如果把希望完全寄托在这种大型的炼铝工厂方面，这就不但不能满足目前蓬勃发展的我国工业对铝的迫切要求，也为很多地方力所不及。
    北京电解铝厂式的小型炼铝厂，比大而洋的铝厂有很多优越性。工厂小，建设速度快，一个月左右的时间就可拿到铝，这是大工厂根本办不到的。在炼铝只能采取电解方法的今天，如何解决铝的电源是一个重要的关键问题。一个年产两万五千吨铝的大型炼铝厂需要电五万八千瓩，而一个年产千吨左右铝的小炼铝厂只要两千多瓩电就够了。这样小的电量，很多地方可以自己建设小型电站解决。建造小电站不但速度快，发电设备也比大型电站容易解决。
    建设炼铝厂需要大量钢材和炭砖的老规矩，被北京铝厂用土洋结合的办法打破了。他们建厂房不要钢筋，厂房内也不要吊车，就是砌造炼铝厂最重要的组成部分的电解槽，也用普通灰砖代替了钢材。砌造电解槽需要炭砖，但目前我国只有一个工厂生产炭砖，产量不大，不能满足需要。按照那些迷信大而洋的人们的想法，炭砖少就只有等着，等到炭砖生产得多了，再来建设炼铝厂。这样做，我国炼铝工业的发展速度，就会像蜗牛走路一样，使它远远地落在整个国民经济的后面。北京电解铝厂用做炭砖的原料做成炭糊代替了炭砖，就解决了大量兴办炼铝厂缺乏炭砖这个大问题。炭糊的配制不难，比制造炭砖容易得多，这就为各地快速地兴办炼铝厂提供了充分的可能性。
    因为工厂小，又采取土洋结合的办法进行建设，节省了很多贵重材料，它的投资自然也就少，不需要国家投资，地方上完全可以自力建设这种炼铝厂。
    由于我们缺乏炼铝工业的基础，在快速发展炼铝工业方面，技术力量不足是一个很大的难题。如果全国各地普遍办起这种铝厂，在不长的时间内，大批的炼铝工业方面的工程技术人员和工人，就可以通过这类工厂的培训而迅速地成长起来，这将为我国炼铝工业的进一步发展创造极其有利的条件。
    由此看来，这种小规模的、土洋结合的炼铝厂，不但出铝快，可以立竿见影地收到经济效益，而且用钱少、省钢材、耗电不多、技术比较简易，各地都可兴办。它为快速发展我国炼铝工业找到了一个途径。
    现在钢铁战线上捷报频传，令人兴奋鼓舞。钢铁工业发展了，钢铁多了，就促进了机械及其他工业的发展，而机械工业的发展就要求有大量的铝。因此，炼铝工业必须随钢铁工业之后迅速跟上去。否则不但使机械及其他工业的进一步发展受到影响，而且还会影响到整个国民经济的发展。各级党委和政府应该重视北京电解铝厂的建设经验，在炼铝工业上切实贯彻土洋结合、大中小并举、以中小为主的方针。现在应该在大抓钢铁生产保证全线胜利的同时，立即把铝的生产和基本建设工作抓起来，在炼铝工业上也来个大跃进，使铝这个副帅快快升帐，以保证我国国民经济全面迅速的发展。
