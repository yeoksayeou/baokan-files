The broad masses of workers and peasants express their determination:
Produce more machines and harvest more grain
Be ready to go to the battlefield at any time!
    We have heard Premier Zhou’s statement, and everyone is unable to restrain the anger in their hearts. We fully support this solemn statement and resolutely oppose the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism.
    The Taiwan region has been China's sacred territory since ancient times. The occupation of our Taiwan by U.S. imperialism is absolutely intolerable to our 600 million people. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is a public enemy of the people who has long been abandoned by the Chinese people. Any infringement upon China's sovereignty by the United States through Chiang Kai-shek is resolutely opposed by us.
    We are making every effort to carry out the socialist construction of our motherland. We guarantee to strengthen the motherland's strength with practical actions of completing the state plan one quarter ahead of schedule and reaching the designed production capacity three years ahead of schedule. If the United States dares to impose war on the Chinese people, we will definitely give the invaders a severe blow directly. We are willing to directly participate in the liberation of Taiwan and undertake the task of expelling the invaders.

    Kinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan are Chinese territories. This is a well-known fact to the people of the world. Recently, U.S. imperialism has created various pretexts to launch new provocations against us. I feel extremely angry. We must liberate these territories of our motherland.
    U.S. imperialism, this paper tiger, if it dares to extend its claws, the Chinese people will definitely bury it in a place from which there is no return.

    Premier Zhou’s statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait fully expresses our burning anger toward U.S. imperialism's occupation of our territory Taiwan, its war provocations and military threats against our country, and our will and determination to liberate Taiwan. We resolutely support this solemn statement.
    U.S. imperialism has forgotten its disastrous defeat on the mainland of China and on the Korean battlefield, and it has also forgotten its recent shameful defeat in the Middle East. It is now baring its fangs and brandishing its claws in the Taiwan Strait region of our country, intensifying its aggression and provocation against our country. This cannot but arouse our utmost anger. We want to warn U.S. imperialism that the Chinese people are by no means to be trifled with. If you insist on competing, we will definitely resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate you.
    We are a group of young students who have just been sent to the countryside to engage in labor training. We will definitely carry out labor training well, contribute all our strength to building a new socialist countryside, and work with our peasant comrades to run the people's communes well, using practical actions to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan. As long as the motherland calls, we will immediately take up our guns and bury U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in the Pacific Ocean!

    广大工人农民表决心：
    多造机器多打粮
    随时准备上战场
    我们听到了周总理的声明，人人都抑制不住内心的愤怒，我们完全拥护这个严正的声明，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略行为。
    台湾地区自古以来就是中国的神圣领土，美帝国主义侵占了我们的台湾是我们全国六亿人民决不可容忍的。蒋介石匪帮是中国人民早已唾弃的人民公敌，美国利用蒋介石对中国主权的任何侵犯都是我们坚决反对的。
    我们正全力进行祖国的社会主义建设，我们保证用提前一季度完成国家计划，并提前三年达到设计生产能力的实际行动来增强祖国的力量。如果美国敢于把战争强加在中国人民头上，我们就一定会直接给侵略者狠狠的打击，我们愿意直接参加解放台湾的行动，担负驱逐侵略者的任务。

    金门、马祖、台湾是中国的领土，这是世界人民众所周知的事情。最近美帝国主义又制造种种借口，向我们进行新的挑衅，我感到无比愤怒，我们一定要解放祖国的这些领土。
    美帝国主义这个纸老虎，如果胆敢伸出魔爪，中国人民一定让它死无葬身之地。

    周总理关于台湾海峡局势的声明，完全表达了我们对美国帝国主义霸占我国领土台湾、对我国进行战争挑衅和军事威胁的心头怒火和我们解放台湾的意志和决心，我们坚决拥护这个严正的声明。
    美国帝国主义忘记了它在中国大陆和朝鲜战场上的惨败，也忘记了最近在中东地区的可耻失败，竟然又在我国台湾海峡地区张牙舞爪，加紧扩大对我国的侵略和挑衅，这不能不激起了我们的万分愤怒。我们要警告美帝国主义，中国人民决不是好惹的，如果你们一定要较量一番，我们就一定坚决彻底干净全部地消灭你们。
    我们是刚刚下放到农村进行劳动锻炼的一群青年学生。我们一定好好进行劳动锻炼，为建设社会主义新农村贡献出自己一切力量，和农民同志一起，办好人民公社，用实际行动支援解放台湾的斗争。只要祖国一召唤，我们就马上拿起枪杆，把美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团埋葬在太平洋中！
