Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- U.S. imperialism has recently intensified its activities of armed aggression against China more actively. On the fifth day after the resumption of the Sino-U.S. talks, it announced the establishment of a unified forward combat command of the U.S. military in Taiwan as a command organization for military adventures against China. According to the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command announcement on the 19th, "The United States has strengthened its army, navy, and air force units in the Formosa (Taiwan) area," therefore, "it is necessary to concentrate command authority over all troops stationed in the Taiwan area." The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered the expansion of the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command into a forward combat command, directly under the command of Felt, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Area Forces in Pearl Harbor.

    In order to mislead people, the American aggressors decided not to put up the signboard of this U.S. military forward combat command in Taiwan. This aggressive organization still retains the original name of the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command. According to the announcement, the commander of the U.S. military in Taiwan is still Smoot, who "directly commands the forces necessary for all U.S. military operations in the Taiwan area." Under his command, Doan, head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, serves as commander of the U.S. Army in the Taiwan area, Dean, commander of the U.S. Air Force Task Force, serves as commander of all air force units in Taiwan, and Blackburn, commander of the U.S. Taiwan Strait Patrol Fleet, serves as commander of the U.S. naval forces in Taiwan.

    The expansion and reorganization of the U.S. military aggression organization in Taiwan is taking place at a time when the United States is continuously concentrating its forces in the Taiwan Strait area and intensifying its armed intimidation and provocation against China.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- Washington News: While the United States has recently intensified its military provocation activities in the Taiwan Strait area, a U.S. State Department spokesperson on the 19th once again issued warmongering cries. He threatened that the United States is determined to continue occupying Taiwan "with full military force" to support the Chiang Kai-shek clique in order to obstruct our country's liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands.

    The spokesperson repeated Dulles's clichés, insisting that the just action of the Chinese people to liberate their own territory is a "threat" to the United States. He clamored: "The United States is facing a serious situation, that is, the Chinese Communists are currently trying to use military means to expand their control over new areas."

    The spokesperson did not deny a message published in the "New York Times" which stated that in the past three weeks, the United States has urgently transported approximately 90 million U.S. dollars worth of military supplies to the Chiang Kai-shek clique. These supplies are mostly weapons, ammunition, artillery equipment, and ships specifically for landing.

    The spokesperson also stated that the United States is determined to carry out risky military gambling in the Taiwan Strait area regardless of the opposition of its allies, saying that "the U.S. government does not consider seeking the consent of allies" to be "necessary or appropriate."

    美国进一步策划战争挑衅
    在台湾建立侵略指挥机构
    国务院发言人公然叫嚣要继续霸占我国台湾
    新华社20日讯　美帝国主义近日来扩大对中国武装侵略的活动更加积极。它在中美会谈恢复后的第五天，宣布美军在台湾成立一个统一的前进战斗司令部，作为向中国进行军事冒险的指挥机构。据美国台湾防卫司令部在19日宣布，“美国已经增强了它在福摩萨（台湾）地区的陆海空军部队”，因此“需要把对派在台湾地区的一切部队的指挥权集中起来”。美国参谋长联席会议下令把美国台湾防卫司令部扩大建立为一个前进战斗司令部，直接由在珍珠港的美国太平洋地区部队总司令费耳特统辖。
    为了掩人耳目，美国侵略者决定不把这块侵台美军前进战斗司令部的招牌抬出来。这个侵略机构仍然保留着原来的美国台湾防卫司令部的名称。据公布，侵台美军司令仍由斯摩特担任，他对“美国在台湾地区的一切军事行动所必需的部队进行直接指挥”。在他统辖下，由美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团团长多安任台湾地区美国陆军司令，美国空军特遣航空队司令迪恩任台湾一切空军部队的司令，美国台湾海峡巡逻舰队司令布莱克本任台湾美国海军部队司令。
    台湾美军侵略机构的扩大和改组，是在美国源源向台湾海峡地区结集兵力，加紧向中国进行武装恫吓和挑衅的时候进行的。
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：在最近美国加紧在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅活动的同时，美国国务院的一位发言人19日又一次发出了好战的叫嚣。他威胁说，美国决心“以充分的军事力量”继续侵占台湾，来支持蒋介石集团，以阻挠我国解放台湾和沿海岛屿。
    这位发言人重复了杜勒斯的滥调，硬说中国人民解放自己领土的正义行动是对美国的“威胁”。他叫嚷道：“美国正面临着一种严重的局面，就是中国共产党人目前正在设法用军事手段来扩大他们对新地区的控制。”
    这位发言人并不否认发表在“纽约时报”上的一条消息，这条消息说，在过去三个星期内，美国已经紧急赶运了价值大约九千万美元的军事供应品给蒋介石集团。这些供应品大都是武器、弹药、炮兵装备和专门供登陆用的船只。
    这位发言人还表示，美国决心不顾它的盟国的反对，在台湾海峡地区进行冒险的军事赌博，他说，“美国政府并不认为争取盟国”的同意是“必要的或相宜的”。
