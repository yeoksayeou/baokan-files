    The nooses are long and long, swaying one by one, the knot is around the neck of the American imperialists, and the rope ends extend in all directions. The people of the world hold the rope ends in their hands, and the American imperialists panic when the ropes are tightened. You ambitious wolf, overestimating yourself, you are tasting the bitterness of creating your own traps! Establishing a network of bases around the globe, vainly attempting to dominate the world, having just been struck in the Middle East, you come to East Asia to show off your strength, stirring up trouble in the Taiwan Strait, sheltering the sinful Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Chairman Mao said, the West wind is not as strong as the East wind! Paper tiger, revealing its true form, putting the noose around its own neck! American devils, with malicious intentions, creating tension and showing off your tricks, your dreams of enslaving the people of all countries are in vain, how can your dark clouds cover the sun! The people of the world resist together, united as one, with strength, holding thousands of rope ends in their arms, pulling the ropes together with high aspirations. If you still do not turn back and act recklessly, we will make you die on the gallows!

    绞索套在脖子上
    （四川车灯）
    天马一根根绞索长又长，一根根绞索在摇晃，绳结儿套在美帝脖子上，绳头儿伸向四面八方。全世界人民把绳头儿掌，拉紧绳头美帝就慌张。野心狼，不自量，自造陷井把苦尝！在全球，建立基地网，妄想在世界称霸王，才在中东挨一棒，又来东亚逞豪强，台湾海峡兴风浪，庇护罪恶蒋匪帮。毛主席，把话讲，西风不及东风旺！纸老虎，现原相，自造绞索自套上！美国鬼，坏心肠，制造紧张局势耍花枪，要奴役各国人民是妄想，你乌云哪能遮太阳！世界人民齐反抗，万众一心力量强，千万根绳头儿挽在手臂上，合力拉绳志气昂。假如你还不回头要莽撞，管叫你绞刑架上把命亡！
