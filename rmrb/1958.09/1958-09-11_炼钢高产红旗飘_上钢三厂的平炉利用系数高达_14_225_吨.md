    High Steel Yield Red Flag Waving
    The Open-Hearth Furnace Utilization Coefficient of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant Reaches 14.225 Tons

    (Our newspaper reports) The open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, whose utilization coefficient has been leading the country for the past two years, set a new record in August with a steel production of 14.225 tons per square meter of furnace bottom per day, raising the high-yield red flag of open-hearth steelmaking nationwide. Currently, they are advancing towards a new goal of fifteen to sixteen tons.

    The utilization coefficient is the main indicator of the level of open-hearth steelmaking and a concentrated expression of various work achievements. The open-hearth furnaces of the No. 3 Steel Plant were built more than thirty years ago, with poor equipment conditions, a low degree of mechanization, and a lot of manual operation. However, due to the strong political and ideological leadership in this workshop, the high awareness, good unity, and great enthusiasm of the workers, coupled with a series of equipment and operational technology reforms, the utilization coefficient has been rising rapidly in recent years. In 1956, they had already reached 8.81 tons, in 1957 it increased to 10.876 tons, and in the first half of this year, it surged to 12.116 tons, and in August it leaped to 14.225 tons. Judging from the statistical data of the national open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient in the second quarter of this year, this workshop is three to seven tons higher than steel plants in Anshan, Taiyuan, Chongqing, Daye, Tianjin, and other places.

    The main methods used by this workshop to increase the utilization coefficient are to do everything possible to increase furnace output, shorten smelting time, and increase the operating rate. The struggle to get more steel from the furnace and to save time to produce more steel is going on very intensely at all times. After active exploration, research, and learning, the workers have become thoroughly familiar with the characteristics of the furnace. In recent years, they have frequently improved the furnace, and many advanced experiences have been adopted in every production link. As a result, the furnace charging amount has increased year by year, from ten tons to thirteen tons, fifteen tons, and nineteen tons, and in August this year, it has reached 26.8 tons. After the charging amount increased, the smelting time was not only not extended, but greatly shortened. Now it only takes three to four hours to smelt a furnace of steel, and new records of two hours and fifty-seven minutes and two hours and fifty-three minutes have also been created.

    The workers have developed a deep affection for the furnace, and they protect the furnace as if they were protecting an infant. If the furnace is damaged, they feel as uncomfortable as if they had a sore in their hearts. They repair the furnace at the fastest speed. As soon as the furnace stops firing, everyone braves the high heat to dismantle the furnace and move bricks to shorten non-production time. Therefore, their operating rate has been higher year after year in recent years. In the first half of this year, it even reached 93.17%, which is the most advanced level among open-hearth furnaces in the country.

    In order to jointly ensure more steel and faster steel production, the communist spirit of mutual support and cooperation among workers in all links of the workshop is high, forming a fighting whole. The steelmaking workers of the two open-hearth furnaces are both competitors for the red flag of competition and close cooperative brothers. When this furnace creates a new record for rapid steelmaking, the workers of that furnace happily send the red flag over; when the workers of that furnace cannot get materials in time, the workers of this furnace automatically go to support them. Sun Wanyin's group of No. 2 open-hearth furnace is good at slagging, so they teach the slagging experience to Han Xinliang's group of No. 1 open-hearth furnace; Han Xinliang's group of No. 1 open-hearth furnace feeds materials quickly, so they teach the feeding experience to Sun Wanyin's group. "Everything is for the open-hearth furnace to produce more steel." Under this understanding, the workers in other links of the workshop closely cooperate. The gas furnace workers often contact the open-hearth furnace to ensure gas supply; the pig iron furnace workers supply molten iron in a timely manner; the steel casting workers prepare for the steel tapping before the steel tapping. Steelmaking is originally a collective operation, and their high degree of collectivism enables them to constantly create miracles.

    The Party organization and leaders of the workshop often strengthen ideological education and fully rely on the masses, which is the fundamental factor for continuous leap forward in production. They often help workers solve problems in front of the furnace and on the steel casting yard, and work with the workers, sometimes sleeping in the workshop office. They often rely on the power of the masses to overcome various conservative ideas. Especially when increasing the furnace output, some workers were worried that this would prolong the smelting time and did not dare to move forward. They mobilized some old steelmaking workers and cadres from worker backgrounds to educate these workers, and guided the workers to work hard to improve operations to shorten the smelting time. They also exposed the difficulties in production to the masses and mobilized the masses to solve them. In the first half of August, the workshop fell short of the plan by more than 300 tons of steel. Some cadres felt more and more difficult and lacked confidence. The workshop leadership chose the path of relying on the masses and exposed the situation to the workers. As a result, the enthusiasm of the workers immediately boiled like molten steel, and new records came one after another. As a result, they made up for the shortfall in the first half of the month and overfulfilled the monthly leap forward target.

    炼钢高产红旗飘
    上钢三厂的平炉利用系数高达14.225吨
    本报讯　二年来利用系数一直在全国领先的上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间，8月份又以每天每一平方公尺炉底产钢十四点二二五吨的成绩再创最新纪录，高高举起了全国平炉炼钢的高产红旗。目前，他们正在向十五吨到十六吨的新目标进军。
    利用系数是平炉炼钢水平的主要标志，各项工作成绩的集中表现。三厂的平炉是三十几年前建立的，设备条件较差，机械化程度较低，手工操作多。但由于这个车间的政治思想领导强，工人群众觉悟高、团结好、干劲大，加上不断进行了一系列的设备和操作技术的改革，所以几年来利用系数年年上升很快。1956年他们就已经达到八点八一吨，1957年增到十点八七六吨，今年上半年又猛增到十二点一一六吨，8月份再跃进到十四点二二五吨。就今年第二季度全国平炉利用系数的统计资料观察，这个车间比鞍山、太原、重庆、大冶、天津等钢铁厂要高出三吨到七吨多。
    这个车间提高利用系数的主要方法，是千方百计地提高炉产量、缩短冶炼时间和提高作业率。向炉子要钢、向时间争钢，每时每刻都进行得非常激烈。经过积极的摸索、钻研和学习，工人们已经熟透了炉子的性格，几年来，他们经常在改进炉子，每一个生产环节都已经采用了很多先进经验。因而炉子装入量一年比一年高，从十吨逐步提高到十三吨、十五吨、十九吨，今年8月份已经达到二十六点八吨。装入量增加以后，冶炼时间不但没有延长，反而大大缩短。现在冶炼一炉钢，只要三至四小时，并且还创造了二小时五十七分钟、二小时五十三分钟的新纪录。
    工人们与炉子已经有了深厚的感情，他们像保护婴儿一样的保护炉子，炉子受了伤就像自己的心窝上长了疮一样的难受。他们用最快的速度来抢修炉子，炉子一停火，大家就冒着高热拆炉、搬砖，来缩短非生产时间。因此几年来他们的作业率一年高过一年。今年上半年更达到了93.17％，是全国平炉最先进的水平。
    为了共同保证多出钢，快出钢，车间各个环节的工人互相支援、共同协作的共产主义精神昂扬，结成了战斗的整体。两座平炉的炼钢工人，既是争夺竞赛红旗的对手，又是亲密合作的兄弟。这座炉子创造了快速炼钢的新纪录，那座炉子的工人高高兴兴地把红旗送了过来；那座炉子的工人进料来不及，这座炉子的工人自动地赶去支援。二号平炉孙万银小组造渣好，就把造渣经验教给一号平炉韩忻亮小组；韩忻亮小组进料快，就把进料经验教给孙万银小组。“一切为了平炉多产钢”，车间其他各个环节的工人在这样的认识下紧紧地配合上来。煤气炉职工经常来平炉联系，保证煤气供应；化铁炉工人及时供应来了铁水；浇钢工人在出钢前就作好了准备工作。炼钢本来就是集体操作，他们这种高度的集体主义精神使他们不断创造出奇迹。
    车间党组织和领导人员经常加强思想教育工作，充分依靠群众，是生产不断跃进的根本因素。他们经常在炉子前面、浇钢场上帮助工人们解决问题，和工人们一起劳动，有时候就睡在车间办公室里。他们经常依靠群众的力量来战胜各种保守思想，特别是在提高炉产量的时候，有的职工担心会因此延长冶炼时间，而不敢前进，他们就发动一些老炼钢工人和老工人出身的干部来教育这些职工，并且引导工人们努力改进操作来缩短冶炼时间。他们还把生产上的困难向群众摊牌，发动群众来解决。8月上半月，车间比计划脱下三百多吨钢，有的干部越算越困难，信心不足，束手无策。车间领导上就选择了依靠群众的道路，把情况向工人们摊牌。于是工人们的干劲马上像钢水一样的沸腾起来了，新纪录一个接一个，结果补上了上半月的欠账，超额完成了全月跃进指标。
