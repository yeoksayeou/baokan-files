Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th. TASS, Moscow, September 13th: The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial entitled "No Interference in China!" pointing out that the increasing strength and consolidation of China and the Soviet Union, as well as the strong unity of the two peoples, are powerful forces to stop U.S. imperialist aggression. The new adventure of the United States in the Far East is bound to go bankrupt.

The editorial said that the working people in Soviet cities and villages have been holding rallies in recent days, demanding that the U.S. government stop playing with fire and immediately withdraw from the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan, and other islands of the People's Republic of China.

The editorial pointed out that an unshakable unity binds the Soviet Union and the Chinese people together. The unbreakable alliance of the two brotherly peoples, forged by infinite loyalty to the great ideals of peace and socialism, has stood the test of time; it is stronger than steel. The Soviet people unanimously and warmly support the extremely clear and serious warning given by Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, to U.S. President Eisenhower: an infringement upon the People's Republic of China, the great friend, ally, and neighbor of the Soviet Union, is an infringement upon the Soviet Union.

The editorial said that at every mass rally held in the Soviet Union, one could hear warm, heartfelt voices of brotherly love for the Chinese people. Various gatherings held by Soviet citizens have merged into a surging torrent of demonstrations, with workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals unanimously expressing that truth and justice are on the side of the People's Republic of China.

The editorial continued that the Soviet working people, who are welcoming the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are thinking and doing everything for peaceful construction. Precisely because of this, the Soviet people are enthusiastically engaged in creative labor, and precisely because of this, they infinitely cherish peace and issue a stern warning to the bellicose imperialists. For the sake of peace, the Soviet people demand that the U.S. imperialists stop their sinful provocative actions on the Chinese coast.

The editorial said that the Soviet people clearly know that the imperialists regard the arms race, provocation, and blackmail as the basis of their policies. The Soviet working people welcome with great satisfaction the speech made by Comrade Khrushchev at the mass rally in Stalingrad. Comrade Khrushchev said at the time that peace cannot be begged for. If the Soviet collective farms, state farms, and Soviet workers work well, if Soviet scientists achieve new successes, if the Soviet army becomes stronger, then, in this case, the imperialists will not dare to disrupt peace.

The editorial pointed out that the Soviet people believe that the new adventure of the United States in the Far East is bound to go bankrupt. No matter how hard the imperialists try, they cannot reverse the wheel of history. The dark ages when U.S. imperialism trampled on Chinese soil and shot Chinese patriots are gone forever. Today's China is a powerful country that has joined the big family of socialist countries. The imperialists should know that any infringement upon China will provoke a devastating counterattack.

The editorial continued to point out that the strength and power of the socialist camp are infinite. The large-scale mass protest rallies in the Soviet Union convincingly show that every word and every sentence of the warning of the Soviet government leader is backed by the iron will and firm determination of the invincible Soviet people, and the Soviet people possess all the means to counterattack the aggressors. The working people of all socialist countries, and hundreds of millions of good people all over the world, support the great Chinese people. The vast majority of mankind angrily condemns U.S. aggression in the Far East.

The editorial said that every day confirms the profound correctness of the speech made by Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China at the Supreme State Conference: "U.S. imperialism thinks that tense situations are always beneficial to itself, but the fact is that these tense situations created by the United States have gone against the wishes of the Americans and have played a role in mobilizing the people of the world to rise up against U.S. aggressors."

The editorial concluded by saying that today hundreds of millions of people around the world are condemning the provocative "brink of war" policy implemented by the U.S. ruling clique. U.S. aggression is increasingly arousing the sacred anger of the people of all countries. The editorial warned that the patience of peace-loving people is not unlimited, and any patience has a limit. Every step the imperialists take towards the brink of war is a step they take towards their own destruction. The ruling clique in Washington should think carefully while it is not too late. It is time to abandon intimidation and military threats.

    不许干涉中国！
    苏联“真理报”指出：中苏团结比钢铁还坚强
    现在是美帝国主义者放弃军事威胁的时候了
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏联“真理报”以“不许干涉中国”为题发表社论，指出中苏两国的日益强大和巩固以及两国人民的坚强团结是制止美帝国主义侵略的强大力量。美国在远东进行的新冒险必将破产。
    社论说，苏联城乡的劳动人民连日来在纷纷举行集会，要求美国政府停止玩火的把戏，立即撤出台湾海峡、撤出台湾和中华人民共和国的其他岛屿。
    社论指出，不可动摇的团结把苏联同中国人民结合在一起。由对和平和社会主义伟大理想的无限忠诚凝结成的两国兄弟人民的牢不可破的联盟已经经过了时间的考验；它比钢铁还要坚强。苏联人民一致热烈拥护苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫给美国总统艾森豪威尔的信所提出的对侵略者的极为明确的严重警告：对苏联伟大的朋友、盟邦和邻国中华人民共和国的侵犯也就是对苏联的侵犯。
    社论说，在苏联举行的每个群众大会上都可以听到热情的、从内心流露出来的对中国人民兄弟般友爱的声音。苏联公民举行的各种集会汇成了一个汹涌澎湃的示威洪流，工人、集体农庄庄员、知识分子都一致表示，真理和正义是在中华人民共和国这边。
    社论接着说，正在迎接苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的苏联劳动人民所想的所做的都是为了和平建设。正因为如此，苏联人民满腔热情地从事创造性的劳动，正因为如此，他们无限地珍视和平，他们对好战的帝国主义者提出严正警告。为了和平，苏联人民要求美国帝国主义者停止在中国沿海的罪恶挑衅行动。
    社论说，苏联人清楚地知道，帝国主义者把军备竞赛、挑衅和讹诈当作自己政策的基础。苏联劳动人民极其满意地欢迎赫鲁晓夫同志在斯大林格勒群众大会上发表的演说。赫鲁晓夫同志当时说，和平是不能祈求的。如果苏联的集体农庄、国营农场和苏联的工人都工作得很好，如果苏联的科学家取得新的成就，如果苏联的军队更加强大，那末，在这种情况下，帝国主义者就不敢破坏和平。
    社论指出，苏联人民相信美国在远东进行的新冒险必将破产。帝国主义者不管用多大气力都不能倒转历史的车轮。美帝国主义践踏中国的土地、枪杀中国的爱国者这样的黑暗年代已经一去不复返了。今天的中国是一个加入了社会主义国家大家庭的强大国家。帝国主义者应该知道，对中国的任何侵犯都将引起毁灭性的反击。
    社论接着指出，社会主义阵营的力量和威力是无穷无尽的。苏联声势浩大的群众抗议大会令人信服地表明，苏联政府首脑的警告的每一字、每一句都有不可战胜的苏联人民的钢铁意志和坚定决心做后盾，苏联人民拥有一切手段来反击侵略者。一切社会主义国家的劳动人民、全世界千千万万善良的人都支持伟大的中国人民。人类的绝大多数愤怒地谴责美国在远东的侵略行动。
    社论说，每一天都在证实中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志在最高国务会议上的讲话的深刻正确性：“美帝国主义自以为紧张局势总是对它自己有利，但是事实是，美国制造的这些紧张局势走向了美国人愿望的反面，它起了动员全世界人民起来反对美国侵略者的作用”。
    社论最后说，今天世界各地亿万人民都在谴责美国统治集团所实行的挑衅性的“战争边缘”政策。美国的侵略行动越来越激起各国人民的神圣怒火。社论提出警告说，爱好和平的人民的忍耐不是毫无止境的，任何忍耐都有个限度。帝国主义者每向战争边缘迈进一步，就是他们向自取灭亡的道路迈进一步。华盛顿的统治集团应该趁着还不算晚的时候好好考虑一下，现在是放弃恫吓和军事威胁的时候了。
