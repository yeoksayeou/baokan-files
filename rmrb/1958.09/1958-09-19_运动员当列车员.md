    Athletes as Train Attendants
    Recently, I was riding the ordinary passenger train No. 215 from Beijing to Zhangjiakou when I encountered the following: just as the train departed from Beijing Station, forty-seven male and female athletes from the Beijing Institute of Physical Education voluntarily offered to take over the work of the train attendants. After the train conductor agreed to their request, the students actively started working. Some wiped the windows, some wiped the floors, making the carriage very clean. Some students were also responsible for selling tea. In our carriage, basketball team member Zhang Bingguang not only tidied up the windows and tea tables in an orderly manner but was also very helpful to passengers getting off the train.
    I believe that the socialist virtues of the athletes from the Beijing Institute of Physical Education, who take pride in labor, are worthy of praise.

    运动员当列车员
    最近，我乘215次北京开往张家口的普通客车，在列车上遇见这样一件事情：该列车刚由北京站发车，北京体育学院四十七名男、女运动员就主动提出接替列车服务员工作。当列车长同意了他们的要求后，同学们就积极地干起来了。有的擦玻璃有的擦地板，将车厢打扫得很清洁。有的同学还负责出售茶水。在我们车厢里的篮球队队员张炳光同学除了有次序地将门窗玻璃、茶桌擦得干干净净外，对下车旅客帮助也非常周到。
    我认为北京体育学院运动员们的这种以劳动为荣的社会主义高尚品质，是值得表扬的。
