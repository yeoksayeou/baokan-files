Xinhua News Agency, 27th: According to TASS, Moscow: A "News" observer published an article today stating that the US-launched provocations in the Taiwan Strait region have plunged the Eisenhower-Dulles policy into the most serious crisis, arousing indignation among people all over the world. However, the US leaders are unwilling to take the path of reason, and continue to escalate the situation in the Far East, concentrating a large number of troops in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, preparing to invade the People's Republic of China. US generals recently formulated joint action plans with Chiang Kai-shek elements in Taipei.

At the same time, the American aggressors have adopted another trick to deceive the public, that is, they insist that they are committed to a peaceful settlement, and use the Sino-US talks in Warsaw and the US government's "proposals" in the talks as proof.

According to foreign news agencies, the US representative formally proposed a "ceasefire" in the Warsaw talks. This is another trick of the American aggressors, and they have been boasting to the world about their "peace proposals." The article said that in fact, this is just an attempt to ensure that the United States can continue to occupy Taiwan, continue to engage in piracy in the Taiwan Strait, and directly exercise military control over the coastal islands, so as to use these islands as a springboard for aggression against the Chinese mainland. Needless to say, this attempt is in vain.

The article pointed out that now a question arises, since the United States has had the opportunity to confirm that China's position, which has received full support from the Soviet Union and won the sympathy of people all over the world, is unwavering, why does it still put forward the absurd "ceasefire" proposal, and shamelessly hint that the "neutralization" of China's coastal islands is possible?

In recent days, the remarks in the American newspapers have exposed this conspiracy. Judging from these remarks, the American aggressors, who are internationally isolated due to their adventures in the Far East, are trying to break the isolation with this clumsy trick. The article concluded that the people of all countries will never be fooled. No tricks and gimmicks can help the American aggressors. They must be fully responsible for the threat to peace caused by their provocations in the Far East.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 28th: The Cairo "Evening News" published a commentary today saying that the situation in the Far East has become more serious because the United States is using the Sino-US Warsaw talks as a smokescreen to cover up its military preparations and prevent China from taking any military actions in self-defense. The "Evening News" believes that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd's statement at the United Nations General Assembly that the situation in the Far East is not serious and even hopeful is a lie. The newspaper said that it is difficult not to draw the conclusion that Lloyd's speech was only to appease British public opinion's indignation at the attitude taken by the British government in the United Nations debate on the Far East issue.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 27th: The "Bombay Chronicle" on the 26th refuted the US clamor for China to "ceasefire" in the Taiwan Strait area. The newspaper said that the United States, on the one hand, wants China to "give up the use of force," but the United States itself is gathering huge military forces in the Taiwan area. The newspaper said that it is not difficult for people to discover who is deceiving whom?

### 各国舆论斥责美国“停火”谬论  谈判烟幕盖不住侵略阴谋

    各国舆论斥责美国“停火”谬论
    谈判烟幕盖不住侵略阴谋
    新华社27日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：今天“消息报”观察家发表文章说，美国在台湾海峡地区发动的挑衅行为使艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯的政策陷入最严重的危机，引起了全世界人民的愤慨。但是，美国领导人不愿意走理智的道路，而继续使远东局势白热化，在台湾和台湾海峡地区集结大量军队，准备侵略中华人民共和国。美国的将军们最近在台北同蒋介石分子制定了联合行动计划。
    同时美国侵略者还采取了另一个欺骗公众的伎俩，这就是他们硬说他们致力于和平解决，并且用华沙中美会谈和美国政府在会谈中的“建议”来作为证明。
    据外国通讯社报道，美国代表在华沙谈判中正式提出了“停火”的建议。这又是美国侵略者的一个伎俩，他们已经在向全世界大事吹嘘他们的“和平建议”。文章说，实际上，这只是企图保证美国能继续占领台湾，继续在台湾海峡干海盗勾当，并由自己直接对沿海岛屿实行军事控制，以便利用这些岛屿作为侵略中国大陆的跳板。不用多说，这种企图是白费心机的。
    文章指出，现在产生一个问题，既然美国已经有机会确信得到苏联充分支持并博得全世界人民同情的中国的立场是坚定不移的，为什么它还提出荒谬的“停火”建议，还无耻地暗示中国沿海岛屿的“中立化”是可能的呢？
    最近几天，美国报刊上的言论暴露了这种阴谋。根据这些言论判断，由于在远东进行冒险而在国际上陷入孤立的美国侵略者妄图以这种拙劣的伎俩打破孤立局面。文章最后说，各国人民决不会上当。任何伎俩和花招都不能帮助美国侵略者。他们一定要对他们在远东的挑衅对和平造成的威胁负完全责任。
    新华社开罗28日电  开罗“晚报”今天发表评论说，由于美国利用中美两国华沙会谈作为烟幕以遮掩它的军事准备和阻止中国采取任何自卫的军事行动，远东的局势更加严重了。“晚报”认为英国外交大臣劳埃德在联合国大会上所讲的关于远东局势并不严重甚至有希望的说法是谎话。这家报纸说，很难不得出这样的结论：劳埃德的发言仅仅是为了缓和英国舆论对于英国政府在联合国辩论远东问题时采取的态度所表示的愤慨情绪。
    新华社新德里27日电  “孟买纪事报”26日驳斥了美国叫嚣要中国在台湾海峡地区“停火”的谬论。这家报纸说，美国一方面要中国“放弃武力”，但是美国自己却在台湾地区集结庞大的军事力量。这家报纸说，美国这种做法不难使人们发现，毕竟是谁在骗谁？
