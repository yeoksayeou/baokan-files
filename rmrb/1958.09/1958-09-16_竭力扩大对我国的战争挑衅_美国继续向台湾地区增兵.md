    Striving to Expand War Provocations Against Our Country
    The United States Continues to Increase Troops in the Taiwan Area

    The American aggressors are continuously increasing their forces, transferring ground troops and air force units to Taiwan, our country’s territory, which is about 13,000 kilometers away from San Francisco, USA, in order to expand war provocations and military threats against our country. According to a report from Taipei today by the Associated Press, the first batch of 5,000 newly added American troops occupying Taiwan has arrived, including Nike missile units, ground troops, air force personnel, and advisory group personnel. In addition, a U.S. Marine Corps unit that arrived in Taiwan in early September under the pretext of participating in U.S.-Chiang amphibious landing exercises is now, under orders from the Pentagon, remaining in Taiwan.

    The report said that a newly arrived U.S. engineering unit is building Nike surface-to-air missile launch sites. A U.S. joint operations unit commanding air combat has been transferred to Taiwan from other U.S. military bases in the Pacific. Currently, at least three wings of U.S. jet fighters are stationed at various airports in Taiwan, with each wing typically having 75 to 80 aircraft. U.S. F-104 jet fighters have been stationed at a base in Taiwan. U.S. C-130 transport aircraft, used for transporting and air-dropping troops, are also stationed at some air force bases in Taiwan. In order to accommodate the newly arrived American soldiers, new U.S. military districts have been designated in Taiwan, and construction of barracks has begun, with some projects starting soon, in order to house the U.S. troops that will continue to arrive in Taiwan in the near future.

    The fact that the United States continues to increase troops in Taiwan shows that the American aggressors, who are the architects of the extremely serious and tense situation in the Taiwan Strait, are currently taking active military actions to continue to escalate the danger of war in this region.

    竭力扩大对我国的战争挑衅
    美国继续向台湾地区增兵
    新华社15日讯　美国侵略者正在源源不断增加兵力，把地面部队和空军部队抽调到远离美国旧金山约一万三千公里之遥的我国领土台湾，以便扩大对我国的战争挑衅和军事威胁。据美联社今天从台北发出的消息说，美国新增加的侵占台湾的部队第一批五千人已经到了台湾，其中包括奈克式导弹部队、地面部队、空军人员和顾问团人员等。此外，在9月初以参加美蒋两栖登陆演习为借口开到台湾的一支美国海军陆战队，现在也奉五角大楼之命留在台湾不走。
    消息说，新开到台湾的一支美国工兵部队正在修建奈克式地对空导弹发射场。一个指挥空战的美国联合作战单位已经从太平洋其它美军基地抽调到台湾。现在台湾各机场上，至少驻有美国喷气战斗机三个联队，一个联队通常有七十五架到八十架飞机；美国F—一○四型喷气机已经驻扎在台湾的一个基地；用来运输和空投部队的C—一三○式美军运输机，也驻扎在台湾的一些空军基地上。为了容纳新来的美国士兵，新的侵台美军区已经划定，营房的建筑工程已经开始，有的很快就要动工，以便为不久以后继续开到台湾的美军部队居住。
    美国继续向台湾增兵的事实表明，一手造成目前台湾海峡地区极端严重紧张局势的美国侵略者，目前正在采取积极的军事行动，继续加剧这个地区战争的危险。
