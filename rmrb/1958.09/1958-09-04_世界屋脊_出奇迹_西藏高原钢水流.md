Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa Telegram: The Tibetan Plateau, previously a blank slate in the steel industry, has recently been catching up rapidly, successfully trial-smelting steel one after another. On the morning of the 29th, the casting team of the Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory of the People's Liberation Army's Tibet Military Region used crucibles in a cupola furnace for sand casting to trial-smelt a batch of steel. The quality reached the level of medium-carbon steel, suitable for casting gears for automobiles and tractors, as well as general machine parts.

In early August, this automobile repair factory successfully trial-smelted its first batch of steel. The person in charge of steelmaking was Tang Guohua, an experienced sand casting worker. He only has a junior primary school education and does not understand steelmaking technology, but he has a soaring drive. With the support and encouragement of the Party, after diligent study, he finally figured out the key to steelmaking on the plateau, more than 3,600 meters above sea level. Currently, the workers are conducting further trials, and then building converters to expand production.

In the past, all the steel needed on the Tibetan Plateau was transported from the interior, thousands of kilometers away, while scrap steel and iron had to be transported back to the interior for processing. The successful steelmaking on the Tibetan Plateau will gradually reduce the burden on the country and avoid the waste of transportation capacity.

    “世界屋脊”出奇迹
　　西藏高原钢水流
    新华社拉萨电　在钢铁工业上一向是空白点的西藏高原，最近也急起直追，接连试炼出钢来。29日上午，人民解放军西藏军区拉萨汽车修配厂铸工组用坩埚，在翻砂用的化铁炉里试炼出了一炉钢，质量达到中炭钢水平，可以浇铸汽车和拖拉机的齿轮以及一般机器部件。
    8月初，这个汽车修配厂就试炼成了第一炉钢。负责炼钢的是老翻砂工人唐国华，他只有初小文化程度，也不懂得炼钢技术，但却有着冲天的干劲，在党的支持鼓励下，经过刻苦的钻研学习，终于摸索到了在拔海三千六百多公尺的高原上炼钢的门道。目前，职工们正在作进一步的试炼，然后修建转炉，扩大生产。
    西藏高原上所需用的钢材，过去全部是从几千公里远的内地运来，而废钢废铁又要运回内地处理。西藏高原上炼钢成功，将逐步减轻国家的负担和避免运输力的浪费。
