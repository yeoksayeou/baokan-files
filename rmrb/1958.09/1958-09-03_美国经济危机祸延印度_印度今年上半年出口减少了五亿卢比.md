Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, Shastri, said at the meeting of the council, which is composed of representatives of private traders, that India's total export value in the first half of this year decreased by 500 million rupees compared with the same period last year. He said that the decline in Indian exports was "caused by the American economic recession."

Shastri also said at the meeting that the Indian government will use all means to encourage exports and has decided to restrict imports in order to alleviate India's foreign exchange shortage.

　　美国经济危机祸延印度
    印度今年上半年出口减少了五亿卢比
    据新华社新德里1日电　印度出口促进委员会8月31日在这里举行的会议上，讨论了美国经济危机对印度对外贸易的严重影响问题。
    印度工商部长夏斯特里在这个由私营贸易商代表组成的委员会会议上说，今年上半年印度的出口总值比去年同期减少了五亿卢比。他说，印度出口下降是“美国经济衰退造成的”。
    夏斯特里在会上还说，印度政府将用一切方法鼓励出口，并且决定限制进口，以便缓和印度外汇缺乏的情况。他说，“长期解决外汇问题的唯一办法就是增加我们的出口”，以弥补印度经济发展所必须的输入货物所花的费用。
    印度政府已经宣布撤销对二百种货物的出口管制，其中包括纺织品、糖制品、电气工具和设备、钢铁制成品、某种类型的金属以及亚麻子油和蓖麻子油等某些植物油。
