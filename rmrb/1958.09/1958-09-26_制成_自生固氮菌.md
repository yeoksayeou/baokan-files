    Made "Azotobacter"

    The employees of the Shinan Township Youth Bacterial Fertilizer Factory in Yulin County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, successfully cultivated Azotobacter by using red russet flour (i.e., sweet potato) as the main raw material for the culture medium. After testing by the local hospital and use by agricultural cooperatives, the results proved to be good, with very few miscellaneous bacteria, basically meeting the national standard of no more than 10% miscellaneous bacteria. The success of this creation not only explored new methods for cultivating bacteria, reduced the production cost of bacterial fertilizers, and solved the current fertilizer use in agricultural production, but also found new uses for russet flour. The Azotobacter produced by this factory uses nine raw materials such as dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, ferric chloride, sucrose, and red russet flour as a culture medium, and the bacteria are cultivated through strict sterilization and inoculation procedures. The cost of each bottle is only two jiao, which can supply the nitrogen fertilizer needed for ten to fifteen mu of land.
    Using sweet potatoes to make "Azotobacter" is easy to produce, low in cost, and convenient to use. Just dilute a small bottle of bacteria with cold boiled water and spray it with a sprayer on ten culture bricks made in advance with mud fertilizer, plant ash, superphosphate, brown sugar, etc. (use new, water-soaked fire bricks, each brick using six liang and four qian of fertile mud, zero point one six qian of superphosphate, and zero point six four qian each of plant ash and brown sugar, mixed with water to form a paste), then soak the culture bricks in a water pool and cultivate them indoors at a temperature of 25 to 30 degrees Celsius. After three to five days, white-yellow and brown colonies will appear on the bricks, at which time the mud can be scraped off, diluted with water, and used by dipping seedling roots, mixing seeds, or mixing base fertilizer (avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight when applying). Using only the mud from one brick per mu of land can provide enough nitrogen fertilizer. Because this bacterium can fix nitrogen from the air to supply plant growth, the yield increase rate is also very high. According to foreign experience, the application of this bacterial fertilizer can increase rice production by 25% to 30%, sweet potatoes by 50%, and vegetables by 80%.
    Now this factory has entered the stage of mass production. All the factory employees are working hard day and night, producing about 1,200 bottles a day, enough for 12,000 to 17,000 mu of land. This not only meets the needs of the township but also supports other areas in large quantities.

    制成“自生固氮菌”
    黎首祯
    广西僮族自治区玉林县石南乡青年细菌肥料厂的职工，用红茹粉（即甘薯）做为培养基的主要原料，培养自生固氮菌获得成功。经过当地医院化验和农业社使用，证明结果良好，杂菌很少，基本上符合了杂菌不超过10％的国家标准。这一创造的成功，不但为培养细菌摸出了新的方法，降低了细菌肥料的生产成本，解决当前农业生产上的用肥，而且为茹粉找出了新的用途。这个厂生产的自生固氮菌，是用磷酸氢二钾、氯化钠、氯化铁、蔗糖、红茹粉等九种原料作为培养基，经过严密的灭菌和接种工作培养出来的菌种，每瓶成本只两角钱，就可以供给十至十五亩地所需的氮肥。
    用甘薯制“自生固氮菌”，生产易，成本轻，使用又方便。一小瓶菌种，只要把它用凉开水释稀，用喷雾器喷在事先用泥肥、草木灰、过磷酸钙、红糖等制成的十块培养砖上（用新的已浸透水的火砖，每块砖用肥泥六两四钱，过磷酸钙零点一六钱，草木灰、红糖各零点六四钱，加水搞成糊状糊上），然后把培养砖放在水池里浸过后，在保持摄氏二十五至三十度温度的室内培养，三至五天之后，砖上出现了白黄色褐色的菌落，那时就可以把泥刮下，加水释稀，用沾秧根、拌种、拌基肥等方法使用（施用时不要让太阳光久晒），每亩地只用上一块砖上的泥，就可以获得足够的氮肥了。由于这种细菌能固定空气中的氮素供给植物生长，增产率也很高。根据外地经验，施用了这种细菌肥料，水稻可增产25％到30％，红茹可增产50％，蔬菜可增产80％。
    现在这厂已进入了大批生产阶段。全厂职工，日夜苦战，每天生产一千二百瓶左右，足供一万二千至一万七千亩地使用。这不但满足了本乡的需要，还大批地支持外地。
