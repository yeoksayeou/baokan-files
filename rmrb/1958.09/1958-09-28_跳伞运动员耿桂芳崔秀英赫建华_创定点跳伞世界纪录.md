    Skydivers Geng Guifang, Cui Xiuying, He Jianhua
    Set World Parachuting Record
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Our excellent skydivers Geng Guifang, Cui Xiuying, and He Jianhua, at the recently held National First Gliding and Parachuting Competition, broke the world record for the women's 1,000-meter daytime team spot landing. Their score was 9.817 meters. The world record was 14.94 meters, set by Soviet athletes in 1956.
    They broke this world record at ten o'clock on the morning of September 21st. That day, after the three athletes jumped from the plane at an altitude of 1,000 meters, they all landed very close to the target center. He Jianhua's score was the best, 4.17 meters from the target center; Geng Guifang was 12.80 meters, and Cui Xiuying was 12.48 meters.
    Geng Guifang, Cui Xiuying, and He Jianhua are all young women around twenty years old, and only started practicing parachuting in early 1956.

    她们是在9月21日上午十点钟打破这项世界纪录的。这天，三名运动员从一千公尺高空的飞机上跳下来后，都落在离靶中心很近的地方，赫建华的成绩最好，离靶中心四点一七公尺，耿桂芳是十二点八○公尺，崔秀英是十二点四八公尺。
