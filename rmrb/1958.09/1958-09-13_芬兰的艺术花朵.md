Finnish Art Blossoms
Ai Zhongxin

Under the patronage of President Urho Kaleva Kekkonen, the Finnish Art Exhibition has organized several hundred original oil paintings, prints, sculptures, and wood carvings by nearly a hundred artists, traveling thousands of miles to our country. This is a grand event in Sino-Finnish cultural exchange. The Chinese people greatly appreciate Finnish art. We have found precious friendship in many artworks from our Finnish friends, a friendship that is conveyed to our hearts through the language of imagery.

The Chinese people are no strangers to Finnish art. We have always been concerned about Finnish literature and art, which have their own deep national sentiments. We have long admired the many paintings of the great Finnish painter Albert Edelfelt from the end of the last century, and the modern and outstanding sculptor Wäinö Aaltonen's "Peace" is also deeply rooted in the hearts of our people.

At this exhibition, we see Albert Edelfelt's "Fishermen on the Island" and "One-Eyed Karelian," which successfully portray the images of ordinary laborers. These ordinary people who are not noticed receive the painter's deep concern. Here, the painter explores the fishermen's firm and kind hearts. They tread a steady pace on the road of life; time flows by like water, and life is endless. This is a perfect painting; the painter creates a true image of the laborer, and he has made significant achievements in expressing the profoundness of the theme. It can be seen that his creation accepted the direct influence of the Millet School and the Bastien-Lepage School when he studied painting in France in the 1890s.

Järnefelt Eero, an oil painter of the same era as Albert, his touching work "Forced Labor" seems to have a stronger local flavor, and a strong local color can be felt in the picture. Finland and the Soviet Union are good and friendly neighbors, and Helsinki and Leningrad are close at hand. The painter studied at the St. Petersburg Academy of Fine Arts in his youth. His oil paintings are realistic. The painter depicts the people working on his own land, and his feelings are deep.

Many works, whether landscapes or portraits, whether sculptures or prints, have won the love of the Chinese people. Victor Westerholm's oil painting "Landscape of the Åland Islands" and other painters' landscapes are excellent. Gallen-Kallela Akseli's oil paintings "First Lesson" and "Portrait of Gorky" show the painter's serious attitude towards creation and his unique talent in oil painting art. Another very attractive oil painting, "A Group of Playing Boys," is Tom Wena's representative work. This subject matter is very fresh, it has moving vitality, and the technique is also very mature.

Among the sculptures, there are many outstanding portraits. Wäinö Aaltonen's "Head of Writer A. Kivi" and female sculptor Lönnqvist Essi's "Portrait of President Kekkonen of the Republic" are two excellent portraits. Essi's other portrait, "Portrait of Female Writer Havi Hemalainen," undoubtedly vividly expresses the extraordinary demeanor of this female writer. These two sculptors portray characters with different thoughts, but they use the same meticulous psychological depiction methods in their portrait creations.

The hundreds of works in the exhibition have extremely different appearances. The Chinese people have a wide range of artistic tastes, but people always love the art they understand, and they always demand to understand life. The flowers of art always bloom in the soil of life. We love many beautiful flowers in Finnish art because it can satisfy this requirement.

    芬兰的艺术花朵
    艾中信
    芬兰艺术展览会在乌尔霍·卡勒瓦·吉科宁总统的赞助下，组织了近百位美术家的几百件油画、版画、雕塑和木雕原作，不远千里来到我国，这是中芬文化交流的一个盛举。中国人民很欣赏芬兰的造型艺术，从芬兰朋友的很多美术作品中，我们找到了可贵的友谊，这种友谊，通过形象的语言传到我们的心里。
    中国人民对芬兰艺术并不陌生，我们一直关心着芬兰自己的有深厚民族感情的文学和艺术。我们在很早以前，就很欣赏前一世纪末叶的芬兰大画家艾德费尔特·阿尔贝特的很多图画，现代卓越的雕刻家威伊诺·阿尔道宁的“和平”，在我国也是深入人心的。
    在这次展览会上，我们看到的艾德费尔特·阿尔贝特的“岛屿上的渔民”和“一只眼睛的卡列里人”，都成功地刻划普通劳动者的形象，这些不被人注意的平常人却受到画家深切的关怀。画家在这里探索到了渔民们的坚定的善良的心思，他们在生活的道路上踏着稳重的步伐，岁月如流，生活是无尽的。这是一幅很完美的画，画家创造了劳动者的真实形象，他在表达主题思想的深刻性方面，有着显著的成就。可以看出，他的创作接受了米勒画派和前世纪九十年代当他在法国学画时期的巴斯蒂安·娄巴页画派的直接影响。
    和阿尔贝特同时代的油画家亚尔涅费尔特·艾洛，他的感人的作品“不自由的劳动”，看来更有乡土的气息，在画面上可以感受到强烈的地方色彩。芬兰和苏联是善睦的邻邦，赫尔辛基和列宁格勒相距咫尺，画家在青年时期曾在彼得堡美术学院学画。他的油画是现实主义的。画家描绘在自己国土上劳动着的人民，他的感情是深沉的。
    很多作品，不论是风景或肖像，不论是雕刻或版画，博得了中国人民的喜爱。维克托·魏斯特霍姆的油画“亚兰群道的风景”和其他画家的风景都很出色。年卡伦—卡莱拉·阿尔塞尔的油画“第一课”和“高尔基像”表现出画家对创作的严肃的态度和油画艺术的独到的才能。另一幅很有吸引的油画“一群戏耍的男孩”是托梅·威纳的代表作，这个题材很新鲜，它具有动人的活力，技术也很成熟。
    雕塑作品中，有许多很杰出的肖像，威伊诺·阿尔道宁的“作家阿·基维的头像”和女雕刻家伦巴尔·艾茜的“共和国总统吉科宁像”是两座优异的肖像。艾茜的另一座肖像“女作家哈维·赫玛莱宁像”在表达这位女作家不凡的风度上，无疑是维妙维肖的。这两位雕刻家刻划了不同思想的人物，但他们运用肖像创作的细致的心理描写的手法是相同的。
    展览会上的数百件作品，有着极其不同的面貌，中国人民对艺术的爱好是很广泛的，但人们总是爱好他们所理解的艺术，人们总是要求了解生活，艺术的花朵总是开放在生活的土壤中。我们喜爱芬兰艺术中许多美丽的花朵，还是因为它能够满足这个要求。
