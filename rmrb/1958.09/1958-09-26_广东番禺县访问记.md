A Visit to Panyu County, Guangdong
Chen Yi

In April of this year, I went to the Shunjiang Agricultural Cooperative in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province. The tremendous changes taking place in the fields there caused the first shock to my thinking. I personally saw sweet potato fields yielding 50,000 jin per mu. Comrades from the cooperative introduced the sweet potato harvest situation last autumn, saying that the ridges in this field were two chi high last year, with eight rows of sweet potato seedlings planted on each ridge, trellised and hanging like a forest. The sweet potatoes grew in piles, like pagodas. Last autumn, the actual harvest exceeded 50,000 jin. Nearby, I also saw an experimental sugarcane field densely planted with 20,000 roots, yielding 30,000 jin per mu. At that time, I thought such production targets were high enough.

Before my visit to Sichuan, I heard in Beijing that some people wanted to carry out such high-yield experiments, and I didn't quite believe it. I am from Sichuan. When I was studying in middle school forty years ago, I also planted sweet potatoes and sugarcane during summer vacations when I went home. At that time, sweet potatoes yielded only about 1,000 jin per mu, and sugarcane only a few hundred jin. Based on personal experience, it was not easy to suddenly increase the yield per unit area so much. But after seeing it on site, I was convinced.

Recently, while accompanying Prince Sihanouk to Guangzhou, I heard that Guangdong had high-yield experimental fields yielding one million jin of sweet potatoes per mu, 600,000 jin of sugarcane per mu, and 50,000 jin of rice per mu (from a single transplanting, not combining fields), which caused the second shock to my thinking. That's why I visited Panyu.

On the morning of September 4th, we left the suburbs of Guangzhou, crossed two ferries, and arrived at Dashi Township in Panyu County. This village is a heroic village of heroic people. The wisdom of the people is like a riot of blooming flowers. In the cordial company of the county party secretary, the township grassroots party secretary, and technicians, I first went to visit the sweet potato experimental field. This experimental field was like a lush hill, or like rows of green buildings, its magnificent momentum attracting me from afar.

Initially, I still wondered how many sweet potato seedlings would need to be planted to harvest one million jin of sweet potatoes per mu? Could they be planted? If they were planted, where would the sweet potatoes grow? When I arrived at the scene and asked, it was immediately clear, and I was completely convinced.

This 1.5 mu experimental field was made into seven terraced ridges, up to eight chi high. Each ridge was planted with 6,000 sweet potato seedlings, for a total of 42,000 seedlings. The township party secretary explained that each plant produces 25 jin per year (using methods of phased digging of sweet potatoes and inter-planting of sweet potato seedlings), totaling 1.05 million jin per mu per year.

This experimental field fully embodies the unparalleled creativity of the people and their high level of scientific expertise. Its characteristic is three-dimensional planting and "high-altitude" development, which greatly expands the planting area and gives the large number of sweet potatoes a place to "live." A four-layer, pyramid-shaped bamboo frame is erected on the terraced ridges to hang the dense sweet potato vines. This not only avoids the sweet potato vines competing with the sweet potatoes for nutrients, but also expands the area of sunlight and enhances photosynthesis. For fertilization, a method called "on-site fertilization" is used, which the masses also call "injection." Its function is to apply fertilizer to the predetermined location and guide the sweet potatoes to grow there. I think this is a major innovation in science. In my opinion, it is certain that a yield of one million jin per mu can be achieved. Even if the yield is only 600,000 jin per mu, this is an unprecedented feat in agricultural science. If the yield per unit area of grain can be increased so much, the planting area of grain can naturally be greatly reduced. The so-called "theory" that China has too many people and a lack of land is swept away by the practice of the people. The sweet potato experimental field I saw in Neijiang County also had the same significance as mentioned above, and now the one in Panyu County is even more advanced.

We also visited two high-yield rice experimental fields. One was transplanted, with a target of 50,000 jin per mu; the other was direct-seeded, with a target of 30,000 jin per mu. The rice seedlings were growing very well. In the 50,000-jin experimental field, twelve or thirteen seedlings were planted per square cun, totaling more than seven million seedlings. There was no spacing between plants or rows. More than ten male and female cooperative members were using bamboo to alternately clip the rice seedlings into rows according to the prescribed technical measures, so that they would be ventilated, ventilated, and have increased sunshine. If high-yield experimental fields have scientific experimental significance, then large-scale high-yield demonstration fields have universal significance. After seeing the high-yield experimental fields, we were very interested in visiting the 10,000-mu high-yield demonstration field in Dashi Township. In a large area of enclosed fields, thousands of male and female cooperative members were working in rows and groups in the fields. Some were "feeding" the rice seedlings (applying top dressing), and some were "hairdressing" the rice seedlings (cutting the ends of the leaves). One cooperative member casually pulled out a rice seedling for us to see, and it could be said that it was deeply rooted, strong-stemmed, and had many branches. Guo Tian, the township grassroots party secretary, said that this "10,000-mu enclosure" had a target of 15,000 jin per mu. Now, everyone is fiercely attacking the number of ears and grains per ear. I asked if they were confident? The cooperative members answered in unison, "We are confident!" This is the voice of ordinary farmers, which proves that science has been mastered by the farmers themselves. Since mankind has had written records, the most important thing has been the problem of eating. Foreign bourgeoisie say that China has too many people, which is terrible! But the great creations of the Chinese people in science have successfully solved this problem. This fact will have an inestimable and tremendous impact on the world.

Next, we went to the suburban township of Panyu County to visit the 600,000-jin-per-mu sugarcane experimental field. This was planted jointly by the county party secretary and high school and normal school students. They adopted the transplanting method and planted 90,000 roots on one mu. Now each root weighs about three jin, totaling 270,000 jin. The sugarcane grows more than one person tall, densely layered, and it seems that bullets cannot penetrate it. Now there are more than four months before the harvest, and 600,000 jin can definitely be obtained. This is also a significant experiment. If successful, it can break superstition. Even more significant is that this experimental field was run by the students under the leadership of the county party committee. They will change from laymen to experts, and experts will become even more experts.

Panyu County has established an agricultural university. When we went to visit, the students were building a three-story building with their own hands. This county with more than 320,000 people and more than 630,000 mu of cultivated land really needs a university to carry out agricultural scientific experiments and research. The students study theoretical knowledge while planting experimental fields. This is a university that combines theory with practice, and it is also the newest and most promising university in the world. Now it is just a beginning, a sprout, and the abundant fruits are still to come. The universities run by the bourgeoisie teach students to pore over books all day long, and those who study agriculture do not farm, cultivating a group of bookworms. Our universities should completely overturn this set of things. The way Panyu County runs its university can be said to be an example of daring to think and dare to do. County Party Secretary Guo Xinmin told me that they are also preparing to establish an industrial specialized school. Now the county already has nearly 3,000 factories of all sizes, and it is very necessary to have it to specially train industrial technical personnel in order to achieve the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. Panyu County has built a large-scale biogas power station, as well as its own shipyard and agricultural machinery factory. Young technician Zhu Ke, who only studied in junior high school in the past, has now been trained into an expert in production practice. He wrote a book on the use of biogas, which has sold more than 200,000 copies. Near the biogas power station, there is an automated granular fertilizer manufacturing plant. I asked them, "Who created the machine?" They said, "It's hard to say, we learn a little when we visit, read a little in the newspaper, and think a little ourselves." This is a correct and wonderful answer. The bourgeoisie attaches personal trademarks to every invention and creation, and enjoys so-called patent rights, often attributing the creations of millions of people to themselves. Here, all inventions and creations are the collective wisdom of the masses.

Just when I was visiting Panyu County, the county had just announced the day before that the entire county had established a people's commune. Regarding this major event, I asked everyone I met on the road, in the canteen, and in the fields, and solicited the opinions of the people. There were agricultural cooperative production team leaders, cooperative members, and old women. They were overjoyed and praised it unanimously. Some said: The new system of the people's commune, everyone contributes labor, everyone shares a purse, I am for everyone, everyone is for me, and there is nothing to worry about. Some said: Eating is free, medical treatment is free, schooling is free, and a laborer still has an income of ten yuan a month; I didn't expect that we would gradually transition to communism so quickly. Two old women were sitting on stone benches under a tree, enjoying the cool. I asked them if the people's commune was good? They said in unison: "It's good, everyone has food, clothing, and something to do. It's very good!"

Panyu County has the conditions to run one county and one commune. This county is a plain, the land is connected, the population distribution is relatively concentrated, and the production level and living standards of the agricultural cooperatives are also roughly the same. This year, the production has made a great leap forward, and the total industrial and agricultural output value of the county is expected to reach more than 316 million yuan (an average of 976 yuan per person according to the total population), an increase of 368% over last year. One county and one commune unites the urban and rural populations, implements a grain supply system, and distributes wages according to grades. Based on the county's original relatively affluent situation and the large leap in progress, it can be done this way. The county's leadership's original plan advanced a little too quickly in the distribution system, and the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee has pointed out the correction. Now, they are formulating a commune plan to arrange and lead the people to an infinitely beautiful and happy future.

During this one-day visit to Panyu County, I saw new atmospheres, new creations, and new achievements that I could not have imagined before. In 1949, we seized political power, which was naturally a great victory. But the feeling of comfort at that time was not comparable to today. Now our country is booming and progressing rapidly, and its grain production has jumped to the forefront of the world. Other aspects must also catch up. It is really one day equal to twenty years, and one year equal to several hundred years! This is the unparalleled power generated by the mastery of Marxism-Leninism by the people and the mastery of the masses of the people by Marxism-Leninism.

The facts in Panyu County also prove that agricultural science and even industrial science are not out of reach. As long as we follow the mass line and liberate science from its narrow confines, we can leap forward. Who invented the experiments of tens of thousands of jin of rice per mu, hundreds of thousands of jin of sugarcane per mu, one million jin of sweet potatoes per mu, as well as biogas power stations and automated fertilizer plants? The masses said that they couldn't find it, and said that it was obtained under the leadership of the Communist Party. In fact, this is the mass line in science and technology, this is "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend"! In the past, experts and scholars said that science and technology were out of reach, and the workers and peasants had no right to speak; now, the production practice of the workers and peasants has made the experts and scholars have to "look at them with new eyes" and have to change their views in the face of the facts. This is called "the situation is forcing people." That is to say, the broad masses of the people have created a situation, forcing each of us to strive for the top. Now, we are just getting started. For hundreds of years, the bourgeoisie thought they had mastered science and were great, but in fact they were just turtles crawling on sand.

A drop of water can see through the sun. What I have visited is an ordinary village in Panyu County, which is the most basic level of our country. The various changes I saw here also show that the 600 million people of China are doing things that are shocking the world!

    广东番禺县访问记
    陈毅
    今年4月间，我到四川省内江县顺江农业社去了一趟。那里田野间发生的巨大变化，第一次引起了我思想上的震动。我亲眼看到了五万斤的番薯田。社里同志介绍去年秋天收番薯的情况说，去年这块田畦高二尺，每一畦栽八行薯苗，搭架挂蔓，像个树林。番薯生长成堆，像个宝塔。去年秋季实收五万余斤。在那附近，又看到了一块密植二万根、亩产三万斤的甘蔗试验田。这样的产量指标，当时我认为是够高了。
    去四川访问前，在北京听说有人要搞这么高的丰产试验，不怎么相信。我是四川人，四十年前在中学读书的时候放暑假回家，也曾种过番薯和甘蔗。那时番薯亩产不过一千来斤，甘蔗只有几百斤。根据个人的经验，单位面积产量一下子要提高这样多，实在不容易一下子想得通。到现场一看，信服了。
    最近，我因陪送西哈努克亲王到广州，听说广东有亩产一百万斤番薯、六十万斤甘蔗、五万斤水稻（是一次插秧而不是并田的）的高产试验田，这引起了我思想上的第二次震动。所以有番禺之行。
    9月4日上午，我们走出了广州市郊，过了两重渡口，便到达番禺县大石乡了。这个乡村是英雄人民的英雄乡村。人民群众的智慧，像繁花怒放。在县委书记、乡基层党委书记和技术员等亲切陪同下，我首先去参观那块番薯试验田。这块试验田像个苍翠的山岗，又像一幢幢绿色的楼房，雄伟的气势，远远就吸引住我。
    最初我还想，一亩田收获一百万斤番薯，该要插多少薯苗？插得下插不下？插下了，要长薯块，薯块又往那里长？到了现场一看，一问，真是一目了然，完全信服。
    这块一亩五厘地的试验田，是用土垒成了七垅高达八尺的梯形的高畦。每畦插薯苗六千株，一共有四万二千株。乡党委书记解释说：每株年产二十五斤（采取分期抽挖薯块和间补薯苗的办法），合计一亩全年便可产一百零五万斤。
    这块试验田充分体现出人民群众的无比创造力，他们的高度的科学水平。它的特点是立体种植，“高空”发展，这就大大扩大了种植面积，使大量的薯块有“容身”之地。在梯形的高畦上搭上四层的金字塔形的竹架，把密密麻麻的薯蔓挂起来，这就不但可以避免薯蔓与薯块分争养分，而且扩大日照面积，增强光合作用。追肥，用的叫做“按位施肥”办法，群众也叫“打针”，它的作用是把肥料施到人们预定的位置，引薯块朝那里生长。我认为，这在科学上是个重大的革新。我看，亩产一百万斤是有把握达到的，退一步说，即使亩产六十万斤，这在农业科学上也是空前的伟举。粮食的单位面积产量能够提得那么高，粮食的种植面积自然可以大为缩小。所谓中国人口太多，土地缺乏等等的“理论”，都被人们的实践一扫而尽。我在内江县看到的那块番薯试验田，也有着上述的同等的意义，而现在番禺县的又更进了一步。
    我们又参观了两块水稻高产试验田。一块插秧的，指标是亩产五万斤；另一块直播的，指标是亩产三万斤。禾苗生势都很好。在那块五万斤的试验田里，每平方寸都插秧十二、三条秧，一共是七百多万条，没有什么株距、行距。田里十多个男女社员正在按照规定的技术措施，用竹子把禾苗轮回分夹成一行行，使它通风透气和增强日照。如果说，高产试验田有科学试验意义，那末，大面积丰产试验田则是有普遍意义。我们看了高产试验田之后，又兴致勃勃地去看大石乡的万亩丰产试验田。在连成一大片的围田里，整千的男女社员一排排、一组组的在田里干活。有的给禾苗“喂饭”（施追肥），有的替禾苗“理发”（剪叶尾）。有一个社员随便拔了一蔸禾苗让我们看，可说是长得根深、秆壮、条数多。乡基层党委书记郭添同志说，这个“万亩围”订了亩产一万五千斤的指标。现在，大家正在猛攻穗数粒数关。我问有没有把握？社员都异口同声地回答说：“有把握！”这是普通农民的声音，这证明了科学已经为农民自己所掌握。人类自有文字记载以来，最重要的是吃饭问题。外国资产阶级说我们中国人口太多，不得了！但是中国人民在科学上的伟大创造，却成功地解决了这个问题。这一事实，将在全世界发生难以估计的巨大影响。
    接着，我们又到了番禺县城郊乡参观亩产六十万斤的甘蔗试验田。这是县委书记和高中学生、师范学生合种的。他们采取移植的办法在一亩地种上了九万根，现在每根重三斤左右，合计已有二十七万斤。甘蔗长得一人多高了，密密层层，看来枪弹打也打不透。现在距离收获还有四个多月，六十万斤肯定是可以拿到手的。这也是一项意义重大的试验，成功了，可以大破迷信。更有意义的是，这块试验田是学生们在县委领导下搞的。他们将由外行变成内行，内行也变成更内行。
    番禺县兴办了一所农业大学。当我们去参观的时候，学生们正在用自己的双手修建三层大楼。这个有三十二万多人口、六十三万多亩耕地的县份，实在需要一个大学来进行农业科学的试验研究。学生们一边学习理论知识，一边种试验田。这是个理论与实践结合的大学，也是世界上最新型和最有前途的大学。现在不过是个开始、萌芽，丰硕的果实还在后头。资产阶级搞的大学，尽教学生整天啃书本，学农的不种田，培养出一批书呆子。我们的大学应该彻底反掉这一套。番禺县这样办大学可说是个敢想敢干的例子。县委书记郭信民同志告诉我，他们另外准备办一个工业专科学校。现在全县已经有大大小小近三千个工厂，很需要它来专门培养工业技术人材，以便做到工农业并举。番禺县建成了大型沼气发电站，还有自己的造船厂、机械农具厂。青年技术员朱可，过去只念过初中，现在已经在生产实践中锻炼成专家了。他写了一本关于利用沼气的书，行销二十多万份。在沼气发电站附近，设有一个自动化的颗粒肥料制造厂。我问他们：“机器是谁创造的？”他们说：“不好说，参观时学一点，报上看一点，自己想一点。”这是一个正确的绝妙的回答。资产阶级每一件发明创造都贴上个人的商标，享有所谓专利权，往往把千百万群众创造的东西归功于自己。在我们这里，一切发明创造都是群众的集体智慧。
    正当我访问番禺县的时候，这个县刚刚在前一天宣布全县成立一个人民公社。对于这件大事情，我在路上、食堂、田间，逢人便问，征求人民群众的意见。这里边有农业社生产队长、社员和老太婆。他们欢欣鼓舞，同声赞好。有的说：人民公社新制度，大家出劳动力，大家共个荷包，我为人人，人人为我，啥也不用愁了。有的说：吃饭不要钱，看病不要钱，读书不要钱，一个劳动力每月还有十来块钱收入；想不到这么快就要逐步向共产主义过渡了。有两个老太婆坐在树下的石凳上纳凉，我问她们，人民公社好不好？她们齐声说：“好啊，有吃有穿人人有事做，好得很！”
    番禺县搞一县一社，是具备条件的。这个县是平原，土地连片，人口分布较集中，各农业社的生产水平和生活水平也大体上差不多。今年生产大跃进，全县工农业总产值预计达到三亿一千六百多万元（按照总人口平均每人有九百七十六元），比去年增长到368％。一县一社，把城镇人口和农村人口都统一起来，实行粮食供给制，另外分等发工资，按照这个县的原来比较富裕以及跃进幅度很大的情况，是可以这样办的。县的领导原先的计划，在分配制度上前进得急了一些，广东省委已指出纠正。现在，他们正在制订公社规划，安排和带引人民群众奔向无限美好、幸福的前程。
    这次在番禺县访问了一天，走马观花，到处看到平常想像不到的新气象、新创造、新成就。1949年，我们取得了政权，这自然是一个大胜利。但那时心情的舒畅比不上今天。现在我们国家蓬蓬勃勃，一日千里，粮食生产上已经跃居世界的前列，别的方面也要赶上去，真是一天等于二十年，一年等于几百年！这是马列主义理论掌握了人民群众，人民群众掌握了马列主义所产生的无比威力。
    番禺县的事实还证明，农业科学以至工业科学都不是高不可攀的事。只要走群众路线，使科学从狭窄的樊笼里解放出来，就能飞跃前进。水稻亩产几万斤、甘蔗亩产几十万斤、番薯亩产一百万斤等等的试验以及沼气发电站、自动化制肥厂等等，究竟是谁发明的呢？群众说，找不到；又说，是共产党领导下得来的。其实，这就是科学技术上的群众路线，这就是“百花齐放、百家争鸣”！在过去，专家学者把科学技术说成是高不可攀，工农群众没有发言权；现在，工农群众的生产实践使专家学者们不得不“刮目相看”，在事实面前不得不改变看法。这就叫“形势逼人”。也就是说广大人民造成一个形势，逼着我们每一个人非力争上游不可。现在，我们还只是个开始。几百年来，资产阶级自以为掌握了科学，了不得，其实不过是乌龟爬沙。
    一滴水可以透视太阳，我所到的是番禺县的普通乡村，这是我们国家的最基层。在这里所看到的种种变化，也就看到了中国六亿人民正在做着震惊世界的事情！
