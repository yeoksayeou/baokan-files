　　A Shameful Failure
　　By a Commentator of This Newspaper
　　With the full support of the people of the whole country, especially the people of all circles in the capital Caracas and the army, navy, and air force, the Venezuelan Military Committee once again crushed the reactionary armed coup d'état instigated by U.S. imperialism on the 7th. This is a major victory for the Venezuelan people in their struggle to defend national independence and democratic freedom, and also a shameful failure of U.S. imperialism's plot to subvert the current Venezuelan government and attempt to restore a reactionary regime.
　　As everyone knows, Venezuela is the second largest oil producer and the largest exporter in the capitalist world. The United States has three billion U.S. dollars invested here. U.S. companies control 70% of its oil production and plunder staggering high profits every year. However, on January 23 this year, the tool of U.S. control over Venezuela—the puppet regime of Jimenez—was overthrown by the Venezuelan people, and the five-member Military Committee exercised power. After taking power, this Military Committee implemented some democratic policies domestically and took measures to protect national resources and strive for independent economic development, which caused great panic among U.S. monopoly capital. Therefore, U.S. imperialism tried every possible means to strangle this Military Committee, which was supported by the Venezuelan people. The dictatorial tyrant Jimenez, who was overthrown by the Venezuelan people, lives in Miami, Florida, under the protection of the U.S. authorities, and engages in criminal activities to subvert the current Venezuelan government under U.S. instructions. In May of this year, because Nixon's visit to Caracas was cursed and chased by the Venezuelan people, the United States even sent Marines and paratroopers to the Caribbean base to directly threaten Venezuela militarily. On July 22 and 23, U.S. imperialism instigated Castro-Leon, then Minister of Defense of Venezuela, to launch a coup to overthrow the current government, which was defeated. Now, in just over a month, U.S. imperialism has again instructed Jimenez to send his cronies back to the country, colluding with students from the police academy to launch a military coup. However, the Venezuelan people, who have been tempered in successive anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggles, are more firmly united around the Military Committee and resolutely crushed this coup instigated by the United States.
　　U.S. imperialism is carrying out military provocations and war threats in the Taiwan Strait region of our country, while at the same time carrying out subversive activities against Venezuela. This once again proves that it is the deadly enemy of all peoples who love freedom and independence. In recent months, the United States has continuously carried out armed intervention and military provocations in the Middle East and the Far East, and carried out subversive activities against Latin American countries, which cannot but arouse great anger among all peace-loving people. The people of all countries have thus further recognized the ferocious face of U.S. imperialism and will further unite and launch a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism.

　　可耻的失败
    本报评论员
    委内瑞拉军事委员会在全国人民，首先是首都加拉加斯各界人民和陆、海、空三军的全力支持下，在7日又一次粉碎了美帝国主义策动的反动武装政变。这是委内瑞拉人民保卫民族独立和民主自由斗争的重大胜利，也是美帝国主义颠复委内瑞拉现政府、妄图复辟反动政权阴谋的可耻失败。
    大家知道，委内瑞拉是资本主义世界石油生产占第二位、输出占第一位的国家。美国在这里有三十亿美元的投资。美国公司控制了它的石油生产的70％，每年掠取着惊人的高额利润。但是，今年1月23日，美国控制委内瑞拉的工具——希门尼斯的傀儡政权被委内瑞拉人民推翻了，由五人军事委员会行使政权。这个军事委员会掌握政权后，在国内实行了一些民主政策并采取了保卫民族资源、争取经济独立发展的措施，这引起了美国垄断资本的极大惊慌。因此，美帝国主义千方百计地想扼杀这个为委内瑞拉人民所支持的军事委员会。被委内瑞拉人民所推翻的独裁暴君希门尼斯在美国当局的庇护下，居住在美国佛罗里达州的迈阿密，并且在那里接受美国的指示，从事颠复委内瑞拉现政府的罪恶活动。今年5月间，由于尼克松在加拉加斯的访问遭到委内瑞拉人民的唾骂和追打，美国竟派遣海军陆战队和伞兵进驻加勒比海基地，对委内瑞拉进行直接的军事威胁。7月22日和23日，美帝国主义策动委内瑞拉当时的国防部长卡斯特罗—莱昂发动推翻现政府的政变，遭到了失败。现在，只不过一个多月的时间，美帝国主义又指使希门尼斯派遣其党羽潜回国内，勾结警官学校的学生发动军事政变。但是，在历次反美和反独裁斗争中得到锻炼的委内瑞拉人民，更加坚强地团结在军事委员会的周围，坚决地粉碎了美国所策动的这次政变。
    美帝国主义在我国台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅和战争威胁的同时，又对委内瑞拉进行颠复活动，这再一次证明了它是一切爱好自由和独立的各国人民的死敌。最近几个月以来，美国不断在中东、远东进行武装干涉和军事挑衅，并对拉丁美洲国家进行颠复活动，这不能不引起所有爱好和平人民的极大愤怒。各国人民由此更加认清了美帝国主义的凶恶面目，并将更进一步团结起来，对美帝国主义展开坚决的斗争。
