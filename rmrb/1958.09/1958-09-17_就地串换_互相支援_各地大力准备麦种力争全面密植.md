    Exchanging On-the-Spot, Supporting Each Other:
    All Regions Vigorously Prepare Wheat Seeds to Strive for Comprehensive Close Planting
    (Our dispatch) The winter wheat sowing work is about to begin in full swing. Many regions across the country are using self-reliance as the primary method, supplemented by mutual support, to vigorously prepare and adjust high-quality wheat seeds, striving to universally implement close planting.
    The work of preparing improved varieties for this autumn planting began as early as the wheat harvest season this summer. During the wheat harvest, wheat-producing areas mobilized farmers to select and retain a large number of high-quality wheat seeds, generally retaining more than 20 jin per mu. Henan, Hebei, and Shaanxi provinces retained 25 to 30 jin per mu; Hubei province retained more than 50 jin, and some areas retained 60 jin.
    However, due to the expansion of autumn wheat planting area this year, especially because the experience of increased production through close planting has deeply rooted itself in people's hearts, the planned sowing amount per mu has generally increased from the past 15 to 20 jin to about 40 jin, and most areas feel that there is a shortage of seeds. In order to solve this problem, many regions have adopted self-reliant methods to raise them. Shandong and Anhui provinces, which are short of several hundred million jin of seeds, are selecting them from commercial grain. At the same time, they are also mobilizing exchanges and adjustments between societies to make up for deficiencies.
    In order to expand the planting area of ​​improved wheat varieties, the work of adjusting improved varieties between provinces has also been launched. This year, eighteen provinces and cities including Hebei, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Hunan will transfer more than 876.6 million jin of high-quality wheat seeds such as "Bi Ma No. 1", "Nanda 2419", "Bi Yu", and "Dwarf Grain Duo" from eleven provinces including Hubei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Liaoning. The amount of seed transfer has increased more than 680 times compared with last year, and is currently being rushed for transport. Among the provinces that are transferring seeds out, many provinces feel that there is a shortage of seeds, but the leaders and the masses in these provinces have promoted the communist spirit and decided to "squeeze" out some high-quality wheat seeds to support brother provinces. Hubei Province "squeezed" out more than 190 million jin of "Nanda 2419" good seeds to support other regions in the case of insufficient seeds.
    The Ministry of Agriculture checked the preparation of wheat seeds in various regions through a telephone conference some time ago. According to the reflection of some areas, there are still ideas of relying on foreign aid. In a recent notice, the Ministry of Agriculture requested that all regions must overcome this thinking and rely on the masses and self-reliance.

### 就地串换　互相支援  各地大力准备麦种力争全面密植

    就地串换　互相支援
    各地大力准备麦种力争全面密植
    本报讯　冬小麦的播种工作即将全面展开。全国很多地区正以自力更生为主互相支援为辅的办法，大力准备和调剂优良麦种，力争普遍施行密植。
    为今年秋种准备良种的工作早在今夏麦收季节就开始了。在麦收中，各产麦区都发动农民选留了大量的优良麦种，一般每亩都选留二十斤以上。河南、河北、陕西等省每亩留了二十五斤到三十斤；湖北省留了五十斤以上，有些地区留了六十斤。
    但是，由于今秋种麦面积扩大，特别是由于密植的增产经验深入人心，一般每亩播种量都计划由过去的十五斤到二十斤增到四十斤左右，大部地区感到种子不足。为了解决这个问题，很多地区采取了自力更生的办法进行筹集。缺种都达好几亿斤的山东、安徽两省，正从商品粮中往外挑选，同时，还发动社与社之间进行串换调剂，以有余补不足。
    为了扩大良种小麦的种植面积，省与省间调剂良种的工作也展开了。今年河北、江苏、山东、湖南等十八个省、市将从湖北、河南、山西、陕西、辽宁等十一省调进“碧蚂一号”、“南大2419”、“碧玉”和“矮粒多”等优良麦种八亿七千六百多万斤，调种数量比去年增加六百八十多倍，目前正在赶运。在种子调出的省份中，有很多省都感种子不足，但是这些省的领导和群众都发扬了共产主义精神，决定要“挤”出一些优良麦种支援兄弟省份。湖北省在种子不足的情况下，“挤”出一亿九千多万斤“南大2419”良种支援了其它地区。
    农业部在前些时候通过电话会议检查了各地麦种的准备情况。根据部分地区反映，还有依靠外援的想法。农业部在最近发出的一个通知中，要求各地必须克服这种思想，依靠群众自力更生。
