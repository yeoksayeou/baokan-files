Sichuan Decides to Add 20,000 Indigenous Blast Furnaces
Striving for Daily Pig Iron Production Exceeding 10,000 Tons

(Reported by this newspaper) Sichuan Province is actively and vigorously leveraging the power of indigenous blast furnaces, striving to produce 10,000 tons of pig iron and 5,000 tons of steel daily by the end of September, as a gift to celebrate National Day.

To this end, the Sichuan Daily published a special editorial titled: "Add 20,000 Indigenous Blast Furnaces, Daily Iron Production Exceeds 10,000 Tons! We must do this, and we can certainly do it!" How can this goal be achieved? The editorial pointed out: The key lies in vigorously grasping indigenous blast furnaces. On the basis of the existing 10,000 indigenous blast furnaces, another 20,000 indigenous blast furnaces should be built throughout the province, so that 30,000 indigenous blast furnaces will be put into production by the end of the month. At the same time, it must also be ensured that two to three high-yield "satellites" – counties with a daily output of 1,000 tons – emerge in areas with a foundation in iron smelting. Each special district should also have one to several "satellite" counties – with a daily output of 300 and 500 tons or more. In this way, there will be a sufficient and reliable basis for achieving 10,000 tons of iron and 5,000 tons of steel by the end of September.

Why is it particularly important to emphasize vigorously grasping indigenous blast furnaces and building another 20,000 indigenous blast furnaces at this time? The editorial said that although the province's iron output has been increasing daily in the first half of September, the cumulative total has not yet exceeded 20,000 tons. Therefore, production must leap forward in a very short period of time. Judging from the nearly 10,000 indigenous blast furnaces that have been built, only about one-third can guarantee normal production after being put into production. That is to say, according to the current situation, 10,000 furnaces can only guarantee the production of more than 3,000 tons per day. There must be 30,000 indigenous blast furnaces, plus the existing and newly built mechanized blast furnaces, to fully guarantee a daily output of more than 10,000 tons. Therefore, based on the characteristics of short construction time and quick results of indigenous blast furnaces, building another 20,000 indigenous blast furnaces on the existing foundation is the most effective measure for a leap in current pig iron production.

The editorial requires local Party committees and county committees to devote about half of their efforts to strengthening leadership. People should be sent to take charge and direct operations, with special personnel assigned to be responsible for production, construction, transportation, labor allocation, and other tasks.

The editorial concluded by saying that now is a time of extreme urgency. Party organizations at all levels must take the spirit of leading the great leap forward in agriculture from last winter to this spring, fully mobilize the masses, and work hard day and night to fight this battle with overwhelming force. Before the end of the month, the production preparations for the 20,000 newly built furnaces must be completed, and trial runs should begin to ensure that no later than the 30th of this month, 30,000 indigenous blast furnaces in the province will be flowing with molten iron, forming a second peak in steel production.

### 四川决定增加土高炉两万座  争取日产生铁超万吨

    四川决定增加土高炉两万座
    争取日产生铁超万吨
    本报讯　四川省正积极大力发挥土高炉的威风，争取9月底日产生铁一万吨、钢五千吨，向国庆节献礼。
    四川日报为此专门发表社论，社论的题目是：“土高炉加两万座，日产铁超一万吨！一定要这样做，一定能做到”。怎样才能实现这一目标呢？社论指出：关键在于大抓土高炉，在原有万座土高炉的基础上，把全省土高炉再建两万座，达到月底有三万个土高炉投入生产，同时，还必须保证，在有炼铁基础的地区出现二至三个高产卫星——日产千吨县；各个专区也都应该有一个到几个卫星县——日产三百和五百吨以上，这样，9月底实现万吨铁、五千吨钢就有了充分可靠的基础。
    为什么当前特别要强调大抓土高炉，把土高炉再建两万座呢？社论说，9月份上半月全省铁的产量虽然在逐日上升，但累计起来，还没有突破两万吨数字。因此必须在很短时间内，使生产跃上去。从已建成的近万座土高炉来看，投入生产后能保证正常生产的，只占三分之一左右，也就是说，按现有状况，一万座炉子每天只能保证生产三千多吨，必须要有三万座土高炉，再加上原有的和新建的机械化高炉，才能充分保证日产万吨以上。因此，根据土高炉建设时间短、收效快的特点，在现有基础上把土高炉再建两万座，是当前生铁产量来一个飞跃的最有效的措施。
    社论要求各地委、县委拿出一半左右的力量来加强领导。要派人坐镇指挥，专人分工负担生产、建设、交通运输、劳动力调配等各项工作。
    社论最后说，现在是十万火急的时候了，各级党组织要拿出去冬今春领导农业大跃进的气魄，充分发动群众，日夜苦战，以排山倒海之势，打好这一战役。在月底以前，要把两万座新建高炉的生产准备工作作好，开始试炉，保证至迟在30日这一天，全省三万座土高炉铁水奔流，形成一个钢铁生产的第二次洪峰。
