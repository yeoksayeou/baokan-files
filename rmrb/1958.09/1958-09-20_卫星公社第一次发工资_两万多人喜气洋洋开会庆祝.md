The Satellite Commune Issues First Wages
    Over 20,000 People Joyfully Celebrate at Meeting

    (Our Report) The Satellite People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan Province, issued wages to all its members for the first time on September 1st. On that day, a total of more than 80,000 yuan was distributed. The first person to receive wages was Meng Xiuzhi, a female commune member from Xiaoliuzhuang. When she received her 5.70 yuan wage from the accountant, she excitedly told the reporter: "This is the first time in my life I've received a wage." On that day, the commune held a celebration meeting attended by more than 20,000 people. Men and women, young and old, joyfully raised red flags, and the sound of gongs and drums shook the sky. The wages were piled on a table, decorated with flowers, and people carried the table in a street parade. They excitedly said, "We've done something we've hoped for for a long time!" "Farmers are also going to become workers!"
    The Satellite People's Commune's distribution system is divided into two parts: food rations and wages. The food ration portion is supplied by the commune according to the state-stipulated food ration standards and the commune's increased production, thus permanently solving the problem of farmers' food. The wage portion still adheres to the socialist principle of "to each according to his work" and is divided into basic wages and bonus wages, with the former accounting for 80% of the total wages and the latter accounting for 20%.
    The new distribution system has greatly increased the income of commune members. Last year, during the period of the advanced agricultural cooperative, the average annual income per person was 36 yuan (already close to the living standard of well-to-do middle peasants in the area before liberation). After the implementation of the wage system, the average annual income per person is 57.60 yuan, an increase of 60% compared to last year. Although the income of commune members has increased significantly, the total distribution of the commune only accounts for 26.9% of the commune's total income. The public accumulation portion accounts for 54.5% of the total income. The fact that the commune can expand public accumulation at a relatively high speed while also significantly improving the lives of its members is the result of this year's great leap in production.
    At the celebration meeting, the Deputy Secretary of the Suiping County Party Committee, the Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, and three representatives of the commune members all spoke. They unanimously agreed that the current wage system is only the beginning of improving lives. They looked forward with full confidence to the vision of a happy life with abundant food and clothing in the future of the commune. They unanimously pointed out that in order to strive to achieve a life of abundant food and clothing in two or three years, it is necessary to further exert effort, strive for the top, develop production a hundredfold, and first achieve a greater bumper harvest this autumn.

    卫星公社第一次发工资
    两万多人喜气洋洋开会庆祝
    本报讯　河南省邃平县卫星人民公社，9月1日首次向全体社员发放工资。这天一次发放工资八万多元。第一个领取工资的是小刘庄女社员孟秀芝，当她从会计员手里拿到五元七角工资时，很兴奋地对记者说：“这是我有生以来第一次拿到工资。”这一天，公社举行了有两万多人参加的庆祝大会，男女老幼喜气洋洋地高举着红旗，锣鼓敲得震天价响。工资堆在桌子上，扎上花朵，人们抬着桌子在街上游行。他们兴奋地说：“希望很久的好事让我们办到了！”“农民也要变成工人了！”
    卫星人民公社的分配制度分为两个部分，即口粮和工资。口粮部分由公社按照国家规定的口粮标准和本社增产情况实行供给制，这样，就永远解决了农民的吃饭问题。工资部分仍按“按劳取酬”的社会主义原则，分为基本工资和奖励工资，前者占工资总额80％，后者占20％。
    新的分配制度大大增加了社员的收入。去年高级农业合作社时期每人全年平均收入为三十六元（已接近解放前当地富裕中农的生活水平），实行工资制以后，每人全年平均收入五十七元六角，较去年增加了60％。尽管社员收入有较大增加，而公社分配总额只占公社总收入的26.9％。公共积累部分则占总收入的54.5％。公社能够一面以较高速度扩大公共积累，同时又能较显著地改善社员生活，这是今年生产大跃进的结果。
    在庆祝大会上，中共遂平县委副书记，公社党委书记和三个社员代表都讲了话，一致认为，目前的工资制度还仅仅是改善生活的开始。他们满怀信心地展望公社未来的丰衣足食的幸福生活的图景。他们一致指出，为了争取在二三年内实现丰衣足食的生活，必须更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，千百倍地发展生产，首先取得今秋的更大丰收。
