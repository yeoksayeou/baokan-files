Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th -- The Czechoslovak government issued a statement on the 10th, expressing its full support for the solemn position expressed in Premier Zhou Enlai's statement of September 6 regarding the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands. The statement said that any act of aggression by the U.S. armed forces against the Chinese people cannot prevent them from fulfilling this historic mission.

The statement said that the provocations carried out by the U.S. government in the Taiwan Strait not only seriously threaten peace and security in that region, but also seriously threaten peace and security throughout the world. The statement pointed out that the U.S. government must be responsible for all the serious consequences caused by its acts of aggression.

The statement said that the U.S. government must withdraw its military forces from the Taiwan area and must immediately recognize China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

The statement concluded by saying that the Czechoslovak government firmly protests against the U.S. government's acts of aggression against China and demands that it abandon its dangerous policies.
