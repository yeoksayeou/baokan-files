Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 9th:  The Cairo "Al-Shaab" newspaper published an editorial on September 9th regarding the US invasion of Chinese territorial waters and its intensified military actions there, pointing out the double-dealing tactics of the United States: while on the one hand it expresses willingness to negotiate with China, on the other hand, it continues to instigate Chiang Kai-shek to provoke China. The newspaper said: Under these circumstances, China deems it necessary to resume the bombardment of coastal islands, first to teach the Chiang gang in Taiwan a lesson, and second to warn the United States not to adopt an attitude that will definitely be detrimental to maintaining peace in the Far East.

This newspaper criticized that the United States' provocative actions show that the United States has no genuine desire to reach a peaceful agreement.

The "Al-Masaa" editorial said that the US Seventh Fleet's entry into Chinese territorial waters to escort supply ships for Chiang Kai-shek's troops, despite China's declaration regarding territorial waters, is an act that threatens peace.

The newspaper said that this action occurred after the United States agreed to hold Sino-US talks, which proves the bad intentions of US imperialism—to continue its hostile actions under the guise of negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 9th:  The Indian "National Herald" published an editorial today stating that Taiwan and the Chinese coastal islands belong to China. The newspaper questioned: Why shouldn't China do everything in its power to at least drive the Chiang Kai-shek clique "out of the islands only a stone's throw away from the mainland?" It pointed out that if the United States interferes in these islands, then it will arouse "worldwide condemnation."

The editorial said that, in fact, "the United States is in a predicament of its own making. The US agreement to resume ambassadorial-level talks is tantamount to admitting that China is a living reality that cannot be ignored."

The newspaper pointed out that the fact that both China and the United States have expressed a desire to negotiate is "a hopeful sign."

"Amrita Bazar Patrika" pointed out that Sino-US negotiations, even if held at the ambassadorial level, will "help to stop military actions from taking place."

The Hindi daily "Aj" pointed out that the United States should not only recognize China but also accept the reality that Taiwan and the coastal islands belong to China.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 9th:  Burmese newspapers today enthusiastically supported Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Straits and opposed US interference in China's internal affairs.

The "Vanguard" editorial said, "The United States' insistence that China not use force in the Taiwan area is interfering in China's internal affairs, which is tantamount to closing the door to Sino-US talks."

"Vanguard" demanded that the United States accept the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and reach an agreement with China.

The "Road Daily" editorial said, "The United States' actions in interfering in China's internal affairs are like a rogue; it not only enters someone else's house without the owner's consent but also attempts to occupy the entire house. It is only natural that China can no longer tolerate such actions." "Road Daily" expressed full support for China's declaration that its territorial sea width is twelve nautical miles.

Commenting on Premier Zhou Enlai's statement that China is prepared to resume Sino-US ambassadorial-level talks, the newspaper said that this will show the world who the warmongers and aggressors are. The newspaper pointed out that the United States has even lost the support of its allies and has been forced to negotiate with China. "Road Daily" finally demanded that US troops withdraw completely from the Taiwan Straits.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 9th:  The Jakarta "Republika" newspaper published an editorial today saying that the Chinese people are fully capable of defeating the provocations and attacks of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The newspaper said that the Chinese people certainly need peace for construction, but when their country is threatened, they will certainly not be indifferent.

The newspaper, after criticizing the United States for concentrating troops and conducting provocative military exercises in the Taiwan Straits, went on to say that from all this, one can see where the United States' sincerity lies in resuming negotiations.

    不许美国对会谈问题耍两面手法
    亚非舆论抨击美国在远东继续加紧挑衅活动
    据新华社开罗9日电　开罗“人民报”9日就美国侵犯中国领海和它在那里加紧军事行动发表的社论指出了美国的两面手法：它一方面表示愿意同中国谈判，另一方面又继续唆使蒋介石对中国进行挑衅。报纸说：在这种情况下，中国认为有必要重新炮轰沿海岛屿，首先是为了给台湾蒋帮以教训，其次是为了警告美国不要采取肯定会不利于维护远东和平的态度。
    这家报纸指责说，美国的这种挑衅行动说明美国没有达成和平协议的真正愿望。
    “晚报”的社论说，美国第七舰队不顾中国关于领海的声明进入中国领海护送蒋介石军队的供应船只，是威胁和平的行动。
    报纸说，这个行动是在美国同意举行中美会谈以后发生的，这证明了美帝国主义的不良意图——在谈判的幌子下继续它们的敌对行动。
    据新华社新德里9日电　印度“国民先驱报”今天发表社论说，台湾和中国沿海岛屿属于中国，这家报纸质问说：为什么中国不应该尽它的一切力量至少把蒋介石集团“逐出距离大陆只有一箭之遥的岛屿？”它指出，如果美国干涉这些岛屿，那末它将引起“全世界的责骂”。
    社论说，事实上，“美国处于自己制造的进退维谷的情况之下。美国同意恢复大使级会谈就等于承认中国是活生生的现实而无法忽视”。
    这家报纸指出，中国和美国两方面都表示要谈判是“有希望的迹象”。
    “甘露市场报”指出，中美谈判即使是在大使级举行也“有助于停止军事行动的进行”。
    印地文日报“今天报”指出，美国不仅应当承认中国，并且应当接受台湾和沿海岛屿属于中国这一现实。
    据新华社仰光9日电　缅甸报纸今天热烈支持中国总理周恩来关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，并且反对美国干涉中国内政。
    “先锋报”的社论说，“美国坚持要中国不在台湾地区使用武力，是干涉中国的内政，这就等于关闭中美会谈的大门。”
    “先锋报”要求美国接受和平共处五项原则，同中国达成协议。
    “道路日报”的社论说，“美国在干涉中国内政时的行动像一个流氓，它不仅没有得到主人的同意而走进了别人的家里，还企图霸占整个房子。中国不再能够容忍这种行动是非常自然的。”“道路日报”表示完全赞同中国宣布它的领海宽度为十二浬。
    这家报纸在评论周恩来总理在声明中表示中国准备恢复中美大使级会谈这一点时说，这将向世界表明谁是战争贩子和侵略者。这家报纸指出，美国甚至丧失了它的盟邦的支持，并且被迫和中国进行谈判。“道路日报”最后要求美国部队完全从台湾海峡撤退。
    据新华社雅加达9日电　雅加达“共和国报”今天发表社论说，中国人民完全有力量击败美国和蒋介石集团的挑衅和进攻。
    这家报纸说，中国人民肯定需要和平来进行建设，然而当他们的国家受到威胁时，他们一定不会漠不关心。
    报纸在指责了美国在台湾海峡集结军队和进行挑衅性军事演习后接着说，从这一切可以看出美国在恢复谈判问题上的诚意究竟在哪里。
