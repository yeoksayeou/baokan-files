Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 27th: The newly established Luo Bo People's Commune in Guiping County, Guangxi, has experimentally built a complete educational system encompassing universities, middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens in Luo Boying (formerly an agricultural cooperative), and has gained some experience in combining education with productive labor.

After the Luo Bo People's Commune eliminated illiteracy, the masses urgently demanded to learn more cultural and scientific knowledge. The establishment of the commune and this year's bumper harvest also created conditions to meet the needs of the commune members. Therefore, the commune party committee decided to establish a "Cultural and Educational Great Leap Forward Headquarters" to uniformly plan school construction, and first carried out a pilot project in Luo Boying. Based on the principle of establishing schools according to actual needs, a total of 22 schools were established in Luo Boying, including the "Ten Thousand Jin University," the "Red and Expert University" with its affiliated colleges of industry, forestry, science, politics, military affairs, finance and economics, teacher training, arts, maternal and child health, and physical education, as well as accounting classes, veterinary and animal husbandry classes, political, cultural, and technical schools, agricultural middle schools, private middle schools, spare-time middle schools, private primary schools, spare-time senior primary classes, kindergartens, and nurseries. All members of the camp were enrolled in various schools according to their production and work nature, age, and specific levels of education. For example, the forestry production team was incorporated into the Forestry College, and militia cadres went to the Military Academy to study. In this way, the integration of production, work, and education was achieved. A total of 4,686 people, from old to young, were enrolled in schools in the camp, plus 877 people studying in public schools, bringing the total number of students to more than 90% of the total population of the camp. All tuition fees for students were paid by the commune, and some families with many children even had their textbook fees covered by the commune.

The teaching activities of these colleges and universities are mostly part-time. The scheduling of class time is subordinate to the needs of production. Generally, more learning takes place when work is less busy, and less learning takes place when work is very busy, allowing them to flexibly control their schedules. When production is not very busy, they attend classes on time, and when production is very busy, they use rest time and time before and after meetings to study. Members of the same production unit study in the same school, and if problems are discovered in the fields or on construction sites, research is conducted immediately.

The teaching content of each school revolves around the needs of production, learning whatever is needed for the task at hand. For example, under the current requirement of vigorous steel production, the Industrial College focuses on teaching the knowledge of smelting steel and civil engineering to cultivate industrial construction talents. The teaching method is to adopt on-site teaching, summarizing rational knowledge from practice. For example, students at the "Ten Thousand Jin University" once discovered that some rice seedlings in a field had fallen. They observed, studied, and discussed on the spot to find the cause of the lodging. The school stipulated that these students must summarize their experiences in the ten thousand jin per mu experiment before they could graduate. Political lessons and general knowledge of industrial and agricultural production are compulsory courses for all schools.

After Luo Bo Camp opened so many schools, it adopted the method of "those who are capable can be teachers," fully mobilizing people with various production experiences and knowledge to teach, and did not feel a lack of teachers. Leading cadres of the commune party committee taught political lessons, and middle and primary school graduates returning to their hometowns served as cultural teachers. Li Guangyuan, a 50-year-old ironworker, and Liang Yonglong, a 60-year-old carpenter, were hired to lecture at the Industrial College. Their decades of accumulated production experience played a positive role in implementing the combination of education and productive labor. One day, Li Peiqiong, a 70-year-old farmer and teacher at the "Ten Thousand Jin University," led students to a field with leaf-rolling insect pests, raised a series of questions to the students, and asked them to debate and answer. Finally, he analyzed the living habits of the insect, the causes of the pest, and the methods of pest control to the students. Using the method of combining learning and application, and learning for practical application, the students had high enthusiasm for learning.

    由幼儿班到大学形成完整的教育系统
    罗播人民公社大办学校
    新华社南宁27日电  建立不久的广西桂平县罗播人民公社，在罗播营（原来的一个农业社）试建了一个大、中、小学和幼儿班俱全的学校教育系统，并取得一些教育与生产劳动相结合的经验。
    罗播人民公社扫除了文盲之后，群众迫切要求学习更多的文化科学知识。公社的建立和今年农业大丰收也为满足社员要求创造了条件。于是公社党委决定成立“文化教育大跃进指挥部”，统一规划建校，并在罗播营首先试点。根据实际需要什么就办什么学校的原则，在罗播营共建立学校二十二所，其中包括万斤大学，红专大学下属的工业、林业、科学、政治、军事、财经、师范、艺术、妇幼卫生、体育等学院，和会计班，兽医畜牧班、政治文化技术学校、农业中学、民办中学、业余中学、民办小学、业余高小班、幼儿班、托儿所。全营成员按生产和工作性质以及年龄、文化程度的具体情况，分别纳入各校学习。比如林业生产队就编入林业学院学习，民兵干部就到军事学院学习。这样，就做到了生产、工作、教育相结合。全营从老到幼入学的共有四千六百八十六人，连同在公办学校念书的八百七十七人合计，上学人数占全营总人数90％以上。学员上学的学费全部由公社统一开支，多子女的家庭有的连书籍费也由社里负责。
    这些院校的教学活动，大部分是以业余为主。上课时间的安排服从于生产的需要。一般是小忙多学，大忙少学，由他们自己灵活掌握。生产小忙时他们就定时上课，大忙时就利用休息和会前会后的时间学习。同一生产单位的成员都在同一学校学习，如果在田间工地上发现有了问题，就随时展开研究。
    各校的教学内容是围绕生产的需要，做什么就学什么。例如工业学院在目前大炼钢铁的要求下，就以讲授冶炼钢铁和土木工程知识为主，培育工业建设人才。教学方法都是采取现场教学、从实践中去总结理性知识的方法。如万斤大学的学员有一次发现一块田有一部分禾苗倒伏了，他们就当场观察、研究、讨论，找出倒伏的原因。学校规定这些学员必须在试验万斤亩中总结出经验来，才算毕业。政治课与工农业生产常识课是各校共同的必修课程。
    罗播个营开办了这么多学校后，采取“能者为师”的办法，充分发动具有各种生产经验与知识的人来任教，并不感到师资缺乏。公社党委的领导干部讲政治课，回乡的中小学毕业生充当文化教员。五十多岁的铁工李光远和六十多岁的木工梁永隆，受聘在工业学院讲课。他们几十年来积累下来的生产经验，对贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合起了积极作用。万斤大学的教师——七十多岁老农李佩琼，有一天带领学员到一块有卷叶虫害的田里去，向学员提出一系列问题，让学员辩论、解答。最后，他向学生分析了这种虫的生活习惯、虫害的原因以及除虫的办法。用学用结合、学以致用的方法进行教学，学员的学习情绪很高。
