　　Ode to the People's Commune
　　Ge De
    People's Commune, what a resounding name! This is the most attractive new thing in our country today, it gives people unparalleled joy, it brings together people's most creative power, it establishes newer and more sublime relationships between people, it embodies people's beautiful ideals, and it guides people to stride forward towards the greatest ideals of mankind!
    The creation of the People's Commune conforms to the will of the people and arises in response to the times. For a commune to be established with tens of thousands of people, conferences of more than ten thousand people were held several times, and tens of thousands of applications, resolutions, and big-character posters were produced. The conferences were conferences of promotion, the big-character posters were big-character posters of promotion, and everyone was a promoter. "He who wins the hearts of the people prospers," the people have such an urgent demand to move forward, so it must appear according to the will of the people. Therefore, the People's Commune is a concentrated expression of the people's will.
  The working people are the most revolutionary. The people want to continuously strengthen and expand their power, revolution after revolution, liberation after liberation. The liberation of the people's power depends on a more close connection and cohesion of the people's power, to make the collective stronger. The People's Commune is a good form and a good system for connecting and uniting the people's power and making the collective power stronger. Cooperatives are better than individual economies; however, people have now felt that small cooperatives cannot meet the needs of a comprehensive great leap forward, and have discovered that the commune system that combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers into one, and unifies leadership and management, shows greater superiority than ordinary cooperatives. Thus, the People's Commune arises in response to the times.
    The People's Commune is good! It has "Ten Major Advantages," "Workers, peasants, merchants, students and soldiers are integrated into one, and politics, economy, culture and military are fully combined." This is the most vital collective, which can better meet the needs of the people for further development of production; it can better meet the people's demands for a happy life.
    The People's Commune is good! It further liberates the power of the people, and makes the people's power increase immeasurably: the mountains that originally had no power to be greened have been greened; the factories that originally had no power to be established have been established; the Chaoying People's Commune in Shangcheng County can set up more than 4,500 factories for steel, machinery, chemical fertilizer, and cement in ten days. What a tremendous power the commune gives people!
    The People's Commune is good! It gives the working people better conditions to improve their culture, master knowledge and technology; physical laborers will also gradually become laborers with high cultural knowledge.
    The People's Commune is good! Through it, the elimination of differences between urban and rural areas can be gradually achieved; the elimination of differences between workers and peasants can be achieved; the elimination of differences between physical and mental labor can be achieved; through it, the system of ownership by the whole people can be gradually realized; and the world of great harmony where all the people celebrate together can be realized.
    The People's Commune is the people's great paradise. The people here are all greatly liberated in their thinking, greatly developed in production, greatly improved in their lives, and greatly joyful in their spirit. It is true: The People's Commune is really good, the masses are united as one under the leadership of the Party, the communist sun rises, and the commune will not fall even if the sky collapses and the earth sinks.

　　人民公社颂歌
　　葛德
    人民公社，多么响亮的名字！这是我们国家里当前最吸引人的新事物，它给了人无比的欢乐，它凝聚了人们最富创造性的力量，它使人们之间建立起更新的和更崇高的关系，它使人们美好的理想具体化了，它引导人们大踏步地向人类最伟大的理想前进！
    人民公社这一创举，顺乎人心，应时而生。几万人要成立一个公社，万人以上的大会就开了几次，申请书、决心书、大字报就有好几万张。大会是促进的大会，大字报是促进的大字报，人人都是促进派。“得人心者昌”，人民有这样前进的迫切要求，它就得按着人民的意志出现。因此，人民公社是人民意志的集中的表现。
  劳动人民是最革命的。人民要使自己的力量不断地增强扩大，革命再革命，解放再解放。人民力量的解放，是靠了人民力量更加严密的连结、凝聚，要使集体更强固。人民公社，就是人民力量连结、凝聚，使集体力量更加强固的好形式，好制度。合作社要比个体经济好；但是，如今人们已经感到小社不能满足全面大跃进的需要，而且发现了把工农商学兵合为一体，统一领导和管理的公社制度，比一般合作社显示出更大的优越性。于是人民公社便应时而生。
    人民公社好！它有“十大优越性”，“工农商学兵五位一体，政治经济文化军事全面结合”，这是个最富生命力的集体，能更好的满足人民当前进一步发展生产的需要；能更好的满足人们对于幸福生活的要求。
    人民公社好！它进一步解放了人民的力量，使人民力量有了无比的增高：原来没有力量去绿化的山绿化了；原来没有力量开办的工厂开办起来了；商城县超英人民公社，十天之中就能办起钢铁、机械、化肥、水泥等四千五百多个工厂。公社给予人们何等巨大的力量啊！
    人民公社好！它给了劳动人民提高文化，掌握知识和技术的更良好的条件；体力劳动者也要逐步变成具有高度文化知识的劳动者了。
    人民公社好！通过它，可以逐步达到城乡差别的消除；工农差别的消除；体力劳动和脑力劳动差别的消除；通过它可以逐步实现全民所有制；实现普天同庆的大同世界。
    人民公社是人民的大乐园。这里的人民，个个都是思想上大解放，生产上大发展，生活上大改善，精神上大欢乐。正是：人民公社真正好，众志成城党领导，共产主义旭日升，天塌地陷社不倒。
