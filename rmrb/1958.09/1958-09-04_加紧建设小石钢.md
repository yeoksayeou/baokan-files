Speed Up the Construction of Small Shijingshan Steel Plant

On the evening of August 24th, we launched a fierce battle to seize steel from time on the converter construction site of "Small Shijingshan Steel Plant". In just three days after the start of construction, we completed the civil engineering and concrete work of the thirty column foundations of the main plant of the converter workshop. The blower room and chimney foundations were completed ahead of schedule. Steel ladles, iron ladles and other equipment were manufactured ahead of schedule.

The comrades participating in this battle worked hard and also engaged in technical revolution. For example, the Wang Jie group of the first combat team of the steelmaking team of the Sixth Engineering Office boldly created a method of flattening three-millimeter iron plates by using a roller bed with thick iron plates underneath to improve work efficiency by thirty times and complete the task ahead of schedule during the rush to manufacture cold water tanks.

The Party Central Committee's call to double steel production this year has further encouraged everyone. Now, all the staff on the construction site are determined to complete the steelmaking plant of "Small Shijingshan Steel Plant" before September 10 and produce 20,000 tons of steel this year. We have also formulated a new leap forward plan, determined to build three more converters before National Day, so that the steel production capacity of this steel plant will increase to 250,000 to 300,000 tons.

　　加紧建设小石钢
    8月24日晚上，我们在“小石钢”的转炉工地上，展开了向时间争钢的激烈战斗。开工仅三天，我们就完成了转炉车间主厂房的三十个柱基工程的土建部分和混凝土工程。鼓风机室和烟囱基础等工程都提前完工。钢水罐、铁水罐等设备都提前制成。
    参加这场激战的同志一面苦干，一面大闹技术革命。例如，第六工程处炼钢队第一战斗小队王杰小组在突击制造冷水箱的过程中，大胆创造，采用辊床下垫厚铁板压延的办法锤平三米厘铁板，提高工作效率三十倍，提前完成了任务。
    党中央关于使今年钢产量翻一番的号召，更加鼓舞了大伙的干劲。现在，工地上的全体职工都决心提前在9月10日以前建成“小石钢”的炼钢厂，在今年炼出二万吨钢。我们又订出了新的跃进计划，决心在国庆节前再建三座转炉，使这个炼钢厂的钢的生产能力增加到二十五万至三十万吨。
