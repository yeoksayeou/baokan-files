    Shanghai and Tianjin Factories and Enterprises Establish Nearly a Thousand Schools

    (Reported by this newspaper) Shanghai factories and enterprises, in the midst of the great technical revolution, have set off a surge of vigorously running workers' spare-time schools. Since the Shanghai State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill established a spare-time textile college on August 7th, factories throughout the city have established 840 new types of spare-time middle schools, secondary technical schools, and higher technical schools. There are also 918 secondary technical schools and higher technical schools actively being planned.

    The newly established worker's spare-time schools are mostly established under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, with full mobilization of the masses. Generally, small factories or processing-oriented factories mostly run spare-time middle schools or secondary technical schools. Factories with more complex technology run higher technical schools or universities. For example, the Shanghai Radio Equipment Factory has a workforce with an educational level already at or above junior high school. Because production requires manufacturing advanced radios and color televisions, they are running a radio university. In terms of the educational system, it is also run according to the needs of production and the masses. Some schools have a continuous system from primary school, middle school, to university; some are divided into three stages: middle school, secondary technical school, and higher technical school; some only have secondary technical school and higher technical school; and some also have technical classes of various natures to train workers in certain aspects of technology. The length of study varies from three to eight and a half years.

    In terms of teaching content, all schools adhere to the combination of political theory, culture, and technology. In the early stages of each level, there are more cultural courses; in the later stages, there are more technical courses. Political classes are consistent throughout, with each semester having them. The spare-time technical school run by the Tongren Alloy Factory, one of Shanghai's eight advanced banners, has established three departments according to the factory's three production groups: powder metallurgy, smelting and processing, and electrical machinery. It also integrates the factory's original worker's scientific and technological research group. The technical course materials for the departments are the technical data of the newly trial-produced products and improved tools, or the topics of scientific and technological research. The workshop and the technical office are the classrooms of the school. The factory, the scientific and technological research group, and the school are completely integrated, and the school has also become a "political department" for conducting political and ideological education for workers.

    The teachers for political and technical courses in various factories are mainly "the capable as teachers," and the vast majority are solved by the factories themselves. Units such as the Shanghai Bicycle Factory have veteran workers and intellectuals jointly organizing teaching and research groups, or intellectual teachers go deep into the workshops, extensively absorb the opinions of experienced workers to prepare lessons.

    Workers are very welcome to this kind of practical school. As soon as the workers of the Qian Yongji Electric Motor Factory heard that the factory was going to run a school, they immediately wrote big-character posters to sign up. They said: "We will definitely enroll 100%, and will not be late or leave early." The Shanghai Tool Factory has 2,000 students enrolled, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of employees in the factory.

    (Reported by this newspaper) Many factories and enterprises in Tianjin have broken with mysterious views and are actively running schools. In the past three months, the city has established a total of 80 worker's colleges, secondary cultural and technical schools, and vocational middle schools, with about 10,000 workers, cadres, and young people from society participating in the study. There are currently more than 30 schools being planned by various factories and enterprises.

    The newly established worker's universities and various secondary schools have adopted flexible and diverse organizational forms in response to the different situations of their respective enterprises. In order to ensure that both production and study are not delayed, labor organization has been appropriately adjusted. Some factory workers fully utilize working hours, completing the main tasks within six hours. Remaining odd jobs are completed by other workers through mutual assistance, or by auxiliary workers. Some factories change workers participating in study from a three-shift system to a four-shift system, working for six hours and studying for two hours. After the workers of the Chunhe Weaving Factory changed from a three-shift system to a four-shift system, they tapped into production potential and improved operating procedures. Many workers increased the number of looms they watched from three to six per person to six to nine.

    After students enroll, they begin studying basic technical courses. For some necessary knowledge of mathematics, physics, and chemistry, they are inserted into the teaching of basic technical courses as needed. The schools of various factories mostly compile teaching materials by combining the actual production of the factory and the students' cultural level, and referring to the lecture notes of relevant schools. Some factories have engineers, veteran workers, young workers, and technical section chiefs forming research offices, studying teaching problems on the one hand and researching key production problems on the other, combining workers' production experience with theory.

    After the workers clarified the purpose of their studies, their enthusiasm for learning was very high. The attendance rate of students in some factories has reached over 96%. They not only complete their assignments on time every day, but also try to seize spare time to study the texts. After studying, many workers quickly applied their knowledge to production and achieved great results.

### 上海天津工厂企业办起近千所学校

    上海天津工厂企业办起近千所学校
    本报讯　上海工厂企业在大闹技术革命中，掀起了大办职工业余学校的热潮。从8月7日上海国棉十七厂创办业余纺织专科学校以来，全市各厂又办了新型的业余中学、中等专科学校、高等专科学校共八百四十所，正在积极筹办的中等专科学校、高等专科学校还有九百一十八所。
    新举办的职工业余学校，绝大多数是在工厂的党委领导下，充分发动群众办起来的。一般小厂或加工性质的工厂，大都开办业余中学或中等专科学校。技术比较复杂的工厂，就办高等专科学校或大学。像上海广播器材厂职工的文化程度已经达到初中以上，生产上正要制造高级收音机和彩色电视机，他们就举办无线电大学。在学制方面，也是根据生产和群众的需要来办。有些学校是小学、中学、大学一贯制；有的分中学、中等专科、高等专科三阶段；有的只有中等专科和高等专科；有的还设有各种性质的技术班，为工人培养某一方面的技术。学习年限从三年到八年半不等。
    在教学内容方面，各学校都坚持政治理论、文化、技术三结合。各阶段的前期，文化课多些；后期，技术课多些。政治课一贯到底，每学期都有。上海八面先进旗帜之一的铜仁合金厂举办的业余专科学校，按照厂里粉末治金、熔炼加工、电机三个生产组，设立了三个系，并且把厂里原有的职工科学技术研究小组结合在一起。系的技术课的教材就是试制的新产品和改进工具的技术资料，或者就是科学技术研究的题目。车间、技术室就是学校的课堂。工厂、科学技术研究小组和学校完全打成一片，学校也成了对工人进行政治思想教育的“政治部”。
    各厂的政治课、技术课师资，主要是“能者为师”，绝大多数由工厂自己解决。上海自行车厂等单位，就是老工人和知识分子共同组织教研组，或者由知识分子教师深入车间，广泛吸收有经验的工人的意见进行备课。
    工人对于这种切合实际的学校都非常欢迎。钱镛记电机厂的工人刚刚听到厂里要办学校，马上写大字报报名。他们说：“我们一定百分之百报名入学，全部不迟到、不早退”。上海工具厂有二千人入学，占全厂总人数的80％以上。
    本报讯　天津市许多工厂、企业打破神秘观点，积极举办学校。在最近三个月里，全市已办起工人大专学校、中等文化技术学校和职业中学等共八十所，参加学习的工人、干部和社会青年约有一万多人。目前各工厂企业正在筹办的学校还有三十多所。
    新创办的工人大学和各种中等学校，都针对本企业的不同情况，采取了灵活多样的组织形式。为了作到生产学习两不误，都适当地调整了劳动组织。有的工厂工人们充分利用工时，在六小时内把主要的活儿作完，剩下一些零活，由其它工人通过互助办法来完成，或由辅助工来顶替。有的工厂把参加学习的工人由三班制改为四班制，六小时作工，两小时学习。春和织布厂的工人由三班制改为四班制后，挖掘了生产潜力，改进了操作规程，许多工人由原来每人看三至六台布机，增加到六至九台。
    学员入学以后即开始技术基础课的学习，而对于一些必要的数、理、化知识，则在讲授技术基础课的同时，需要什么就插进去讲什么。各厂的学校大都结合本厂的生产实际和学员的文化水平，参考有关学校的讲义编写教材。有的工厂由工程师、老工人、青工和技术科长等组成研究室，一面研究教学问题，一面研究生产上的关键问题，把工人的生产经验和理论结合起来。
    工人们明确了学习的目的性以后，学习的积极性十分高涨。有些工厂的学员出勤率达到96％以上。他们不但每天按时完成作业，还尽量抓紧零散时间用来钻研课文。许多工人学习了以后，很快就把知识运用到生产中去，取得了很大成绩。
