Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 11th: In the face of the raging anger of the Japanese people, who are firmly demanding that Japan itself try the American soldier, Lamphere, who shot and killed Japanese university student, Yoshiyuki Miyamura, without cause, the U.S. military authorities in Japan have been forced to agree to hand over this murderer to the Japanese judicial authorities for trial.

The Japanese Ministry of Justice received a notification today from the U.S. Fifth Air Force Legal Department stating that "the results of the investigation have failed to find sufficient evidence to prove that a duty certificate has been issued to (Lamphere)." Therefore, Lamphere's shooting was not an act taken while on duty, and it has been determined that the primary right of jurisdiction belongs to the Japanese side.

After the incident, the U.S. military authorities attempted to use the excuse that "Lamphere was on duty when he fired" in order to allow the murderer to escape Japanese jurisdiction.

However, news reports say that after the U.S. military authorities were forced to agree to a trial of Lamphere by the Japanese authorities, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are preparing to use reasons such as "Lamphere is only nineteen years old, so the juvenile crime law will apply," in an attempt to exonerate this American soldier who treats the lives of Japanese people as child's play, just as they exonerated the American soldier Girard, who killed the Japanese farmer Sakae Nakako, last year.

The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper, "Akahata," published an editorial today calling on the Japanese people to launch a nationwide movement to protest the unprovoked shooting of a Japanese student by an American soldier.

The editorial pointed out that the fact that Yoshiyuki Miyamura was casually shot and killed by an American soldier is an undeniable fact, but the Kishi Nobusuke government has not yet made any protests to the U.S. military authorities and the U.S. government. Not only that, but they have also not demanded that the U.S. military authorities hand over the murderer to the relevant Japanese authorities, and have even obsequiously said that the facts must be carefully investigated before a solution can be reached.

The editorial pointed out that the root cause of this incident lies in the fact that Japan is under the control of the unequal U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and that, like the "Girard incident" last year, the American occupiers treat the Japanese nation as a "subordinate nation" and do not recognize the Japanese people as people of an independent country. The editorial pointed out that as long as the U.S. military and U.S. military bases continue to exist within Japan, similar incidents are likely to continue to occur.

The editorial called on all Japanese people to unite and launch a broad protest movement to stop the American occupiers from continuing to create similar brutal and shameless incidents. The Japanese Communist Party is willing to stand at the forefront of the movement and fight.

### 日本人民怒火难消  美当局被迫同意由日方审判杀人凶犯

    日本人民怒火难消
    美当局被迫同意由日方审判杀人凶犯
    据新华社11日讯　东京消息：在日本人民坚决要求由日本自己审判美国兵朗普雷的愤怒的火焰面前，驻日美军当局已经被迫同意把这个无故开枪打死日本大学生宫村祥之的杀人犯交由日本司法当局审判。
    日本法务省今天接到美国第五空军法务部的通知说，“调查的结果，没有能够发现足以证实已经发给（朗普雷）值勤证明的证据”。因此，朗普雷的开枪不是在值勤时采取的行为，已经确定第一次审判权属于日本方面。
    在事件发生之后，美军当局曾经企图用“朗普雷是在值勤中开枪”为理由，以便使杀人犯逃脱日本方面的审判权。
    但是，有消息说，在美军当局被迫同意由日本当局审判朗普雷之后，美日反动派又在准备用“朗普雷只有十九岁，所以将会适用少年犯罪法”等理由，企图为这个拿日本人性命当儿戏的美国兵开脱罪状，正如去年为杀死日本农妇坂井奈加子的美国兵哲腊德开脱罪刑一样。
    日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日本人民展开全民性的运动，抗议美国兵无故枪杀日本学生。
    社论指出，宫村祥之被美国兵随便开枪杀死一事是不能掩盖的事实，但是岸信介政府至今还没有对美军当局和美国政府提出任何抗议。不仅如此，也没有要求美军当局把凶犯交给日本有关当局，并且还奴颜婢膝地说，要慎重调查事实后才能解决。
    社论指出，发生这次事件的根本原因在于日本处于不平等的日美“安全条约”控制之下，同去年发生的“哲腊德事件”一样，美国占领者把日本民族当作“从属民族”不承认日本人是独立国家的人民。社论指出，只要美国军队和美军基地还在日本境内存在一天，类似这次的事件将有继续发生的可能。
    社论号召日本全体人民团结起来展开广泛的抗议运动，制止美国占领者继续制造残暴、无耻的类似事件。日本共产党愿意站在运动的最前列进行斗争。
