The state-run farm breeding ground in Mianyang County, Hubei Province, has achieved good results by using lights at night to lure insects to feed the fish. The specific method is: erecting a light stand at the edge of the fish pond, about one foot above the water surface, and hanging kerosene lamps, lanterns, or other wind and rain-proof lights. Various pests hiding in the grass and crops on the shore, such as grasshoppers, locusts, mole crickets, moth larvae, and night mosquitoes, will fly towards the lights in swarms and fall into the water to die, which can be used as fish feed and also eliminates pests for agriculture.

In addition, various pests such as leaf rollers and rice stem borer larvae, which are caught by agricultural cooperatives in the fields during the day, are collected and put into the fish ponds, which are also good feed for fish.

　　捕虫喂鱼渔农两利
    湖北省沔阳县国营农场养殖场，在晚间点灯诱虫喂鱼，效果良好。具体作法是：在鱼池边缘，离水面一尺左右处扎一灯架，夜间挂上汽灯、马灯或其他可避风雨的灯，岸上草丛和农作物中潜藏的各种害虫如蚱蜢、蝗虫、土狗、螟蛾、夜蚊等，便会成群飞扑灯上，落水而死，可作鱼的饵料，也为农业除了害。
    另外，农业社白天在田间捕捉的各种害虫如卷叶虫及螟虫的幼虫等，收集投入鱼塘内，也是鱼类的良好饵料。
