Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 22nd: By the 20th, all 51,000+ agricultural cooperatives in Shandong Province had been merged and transformed into 1,556 people's communes, achieving people's communization.

The superiority of the people's communes, characterized by their large size and high degree of public ownership, has become very apparent in the past month. The attendance rate in the communes has greatly increased. After the Linyi and Liaocheng Special Zones achieved communization, they centralized leadership, unified the allocation of labor, and fought on multiple fronts. The Linyi Special Zone organized a 2.5 million-strong army to turn the land, plowing 200,000 to 300,000 mu every day; the organized "Railway Corps" has already built 2,000 li of wooden rail lines, striving to reach 10,000 li by the end of the month. The Liaocheng Special Zone organized a 30,000+ strong expeditionary force to smelt iron, transferred 70,000+ people to support water conservancy construction in other areas, and organized 2.92 million people to plow the land day and night to accumulate fertilizer. All fronts have achieved significant results.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd: On the 20th, Shaanxi Province's rural areas achieved people's communization. All 31,000+ agricultural cooperatives in the province have been merged and transformed into 1,673 large-scale, comprehensive people's communes.

In Shaanxi Province, the establishment of communes has been closely integrated with production, quickly setting off a new upsurge in production. The province has organized an 800,000-strong steel and iron army to ascend mountains to smelt steel and iron. In the Hanzhong Special Zone alone, 200,000 farmers built 600 small indigenous blast furnaces in five days, and more than 350 have already been put into production. At the same time, all localities have reorganized and adjusted agricultural labor organizations, vigorously promoted tool reforms centered on installing ball bearings, and launched fertilizer accumulation campaigns.

    组织万人大军上山炼钢炼铁
    山东陕西实现公社化　各项生产全面发展
    据新华社济南22日电　到20日止，山东省的五万一千多个农业社已经全部合并转为一千五百五十六个人民公社，实现了人民公社化。
    人民公社一大二公的优越性，一个多月来就表现得非常明显。各公社的出勤率大大提高。临沂、聊城两个专区实现公社化后，集中领导，统一调配劳力，分战线作战。临沂专区组织了二百五十万人的翻地大军，每天翻地二十万亩到三十万亩；组织的“铁道兵团”已修了木轨火车道两千里，争取月底达到一万里。聊城专区组织三万多人的远征军炼铁，抽调七万多人支援外地搞水利建设，并组织二百九十二万人日夜翻地熏肥。各条战线都取得显著效果。
    据新华社西安22日电　陕西省农村在20日实现了人民公社化。全省三万一千多个农业社已合并转为一千六百七十三个大型的、综合性的人民公社。
    陕西省在办公社中，由密切结合生产，很快就掀起了新的生产高潮。全省组织了八十万钢铁大军上山炼钢、炼铁，仅汉中专区就有二十万农民在五天内建立起六百个小土高炉，三百五十多个已经投入了生产。同时，各地都重新组织和调整了农业劳动组织，大搞工具以安装滚珠轴承为中心的改革和积肥运动。
