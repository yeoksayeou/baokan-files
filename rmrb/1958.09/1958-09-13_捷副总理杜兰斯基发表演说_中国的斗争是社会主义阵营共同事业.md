    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 11th. Czechoslovak First Deputy Prime Minister Ďuranský stated at a meeting celebrating Czechoslovak Miners' Day on September 11th that the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the government, and the people resolutely condemn the United States' aggressive policies and fully support and deeply sympathize with the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate their own territory.

    Ďuranský said that the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind. He said that the Chinese people, who are carrying out socialist construction on a large scale, sincerely desire peace. However, they cannot tolerate the Chiang Kai-shek criminal clique's threat to their national security, nor can they tolerate imperialist interference in their internal affairs. Ďuranský pointed out that the Chinese people have already taken a big leap forward in building their country into a strong socialist industrial power. China will double its steel production this year, thus making China the sixth largest steel producer in the world.

    He emphasized that the Chinese people's struggle is also the common cause of the entire socialist camp. The provocations of US imperialism will surely be defeated.

    捷副总理杜兰斯基发表演说
    中国的斗争是社会主义阵营共同事业
    新华社布拉格11日电　捷克斯洛伐克第一副总理杜兰斯基11日在庆祝捷克斯洛伐克矿工节的一个会议上说，捷克斯洛伐克共产党、政府和人民坚决谴责美国的侵略政策，并且全力支持和深切同情中国人民为解放自己的领土所进行的正义斗争。
    杜兰斯基说，东风已经压倒西风。他说，大规模地进行社会主义建设的中国人民非常希望和平。但是，他们不能容忍蒋介石罪恶集团对他们国家安全的威胁，也不能容忍帝国主义者对他们内政的干涉。杜兰斯基指出，中国人民在把自己的国家建设成为一个强大的社会主义工业大国方面已经向前跃进了一大步。中国将在今年把它的钢生产量增加一倍，这样中国在钢铁生产方面将占世界第六位。
    他强调说，中国人民的斗争也是整个社会主义阵营的共同事业。美帝国主义的挑衅一定会遭到失败。
