Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, 20th—The First International Friendly Armies Summer Sports Meet held a grand opening ceremony at the Leipzig Central Stadium at 2 p.m. today. The opening ceremony demonstrated the great internationalist solidarity of the fraternal socialist countries' armies and the unparalleled strength of the forces for peace.

More than 100,000 people attended the opening ceremony.

German Socialist Unity Party and GDR government leaders Grotewohl, Matern, Stoph, and others attended the opening ceremony. Also on the rostrum were Czechoslovak Defense Minister General Lomsky and other distinguished guests from various countries, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany, General Zakharov, and heads of sports delegations from various countries. Chinese Ambassador to the GDR, Wang Guoquan, and diplomats from various countries also attended the opening ceremony.

At precisely 2 p.m., the opening of the Games was announced. First to enter the venue was the combined military band of the GDR National People's Army's Army, Navy, and Air Force. Behind them were the honor guard soldiers and military school students. As the sports delegations from the armies of twelve fraternal countries—Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Vietnam, China, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the GDR—marched into the venue in twelve columns, with chests out and heads held high, the entire stadium erupted in cheers and applause.

The conference began with a welcome speech from General Stoph, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense of the GDR. He warmly welcomed the sports delegations from various countries on behalf of the Party and the government and wished the conference success.

In his speech, he emphasized that the First Friendly Armies Sports Meet is not only a major event in international sports life but also has significant political significance. He said that the provocations of the American imperialists against China have aroused the anger and hatred of the people of the world. The people of the GDR and the National People's Army, together with the people and armies of all socialist countries, will stand firmly on China's side with close friendship and solidarity.

Subsequently, Major General Revunko, Chairman of the International Friendly Armies Sports Movement Committee, declared the Games officially open. Then, a team of GDR National People's Army relay runners entered the venue with relay batons. They came to the Games to present the warm congratulations from officers and soldiers of various units of the National People's Army from all over the GDR.

Next, twelve artillery salutes were fired, symbolizing the power of the twelve socialist countries.

The twelve friendly army delegations marched in formation past the rostrum to receive the review.

The opening ceremony ended with the band playing "Ode to Joy." This was followed by a group callisthenics performance by 800 athletes from various branches of the GDR National People's Army. It demonstrated the high organizational discipline and excellent combat qualities of the GDR National People's Army. Today, the entire city of Leipzig is immersed in festive joy.
