Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 12th: Ambassador Wang Bingnan of the People's Republic of China returned to his post in Warsaw by plane at 5:50 PM today.

More than 20 Polish and foreign reporters were at the airport to greet him. After disembarking, Ambassador Wang Bingnan delivered the following speech at the request of various reporters:

My return to China this time was solely to receive instructions from my government regarding the Sino-U.S. talks.

The current tense situation in the Far East has attracted the attention and concern of people all over the world, which is entirely understandable. The Chinese people love peace and have the confidence to defend peace. Chairman Mao Zedong of our country said that if both sides have the sincerity to solve the problem, the negotiations may achieve some results. As the representative of the People's Republic of China in the negotiations, I am even more willing to see these results in Warsaw soon.
