Hangzhou Dispatch – Zhejiang Hangzhou suburbs have gained pilot experience in fully mobilizing the masses to establish People's Communes on a large scale. Judging from the pilot situations in six townships of the city, namely Shuanglin, Tangnan, Liangzhu, Jianqiao, Longjing, and Zhoupu, where People's Communes were established respectively, the entire process of establishing communes has been relatively smooth, basically achieving the goal of a triple harvest of "ideology, commune establishment, and production." Based on the experiences of these townships, Hangzhou's leadership believes that the following three issues must be grasped in the process of mobilizing the masses to establish communes: First, debate long-term plans to fully mobilize the masses; second, integrate commune establishment and production into one rope, promoting each other and promoting each other; third, matters that should be paid attention to in commune establishment.

Debating Long-Term Plans, Fully Mobilizing the Masses

The situation in various pilot townships in the suburbs of Hangzhou proves that the establishment of People's Communes is indeed a major change in rural areas. The struggle between the two roads, the struggle between the advanced and the backward, is very sharp. The entire process of establishing communes is a process of ideological mobilization and a process of great liberation of communist ideology. Most of the masses from all walks of life actively support the People's Communes. From their personal experience in taking the road of cooperativization over the past few years, they realize that the People's Communes are definitely better than advanced cooperatives. This is the ideological mainstream. However, the non-mainstream side is also very complicated. Poor and lower-middle peasants mainly consider the issue of how to distribute reasonably. They are afraid that the combination of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers will make distribution difficult and worry that production will not be done well. The thinking of upper-middle peasants is relatively wavering, with many concerns. They are afraid of reduced income, afraid that large communes with many people will not be run well, afraid of not being free, and so on. A small number of particularly wealthy people who were not very satisfied with the advanced cooperatives originally have a resistant attitude towards establishing People's Communes.

In response to these different ideological situations, all pilot townships have carried out vigorous, extensive, and in-depth publicity and full ideological mobilization, turning the establishment of People's Communes into a conscious demand of the broad masses of the people. The methods of mobilizing the masses in each township are roughly two types: one is to start with publicizing the superiority of the People's Communes to inspire the masses' demand for establishing People's Communes; the other is to analyze the current Great Leap Forward situation on the basis of generally publicizing the superiority of the People's Communes, present the township's long-term plans for the second five-year plan period and the production leap forward plan for next year, and mobilize the masses to launch a free airing of views and debate on how to achieve the long-term plan, so that the masses can more deeply recognize the contradiction between small cooperatives and the Great Leap Forward in production, and consciously demand to establish communes. Judging from the breadth and depth of mobilizing the masses in each township, the latter method is better than the former.

Shuanglin Township adopted the latter method, so the masses were mobilized more deeply and thoroughly. After generally publicizing the superiority of the People's Communes, this township immediately presented the long-term plan for the entire township and launched a free airing of views and debate among the masses. They planned that the entire township would realize farmland water conservancy, semi-mechanization and mechanization of agricultural tools, self-sufficiency in fertilizers, motorization of transportation vehicles and ships, electrification, and leveling of land; in 1959, each person could receive 120 jin of pork and more than 70 jin of mutton... In addition, they would also establish People's Universities, middle schools, homes for the elderly, nurseries, and so on. Based on this long-term plan, the masses were mobilized to launch a free airing of views and debate on three questions: "Is the plan good?" "Can it be realized?" "How to realize it?" During the debate, the masses saw the prospect of a happy life and were greatly encouraged, writing a total of 700 big-character posters praising the People's Communes.

When debating "how to realize the plan," the masses naturally analyzed the contradiction that small cooperatives could not handle big affairs and could not adapt to the Great Leap Forward in production, and consciously demanded to establish communes. People with individualism and departmentalism also felt that they were too "shortsighted" politically in the face of the grand and magnificent long-term plan, and therefore wholeheartedly supported the establishment of communes.

In the process of debating plans and mobilizing the masses, attention must also be paid to the following issues:

(1) Debating long-term plans must be closely integrated with summarizing the situation of the Great Leap Forward. The long-term plan itself is a crystallization of the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. Therefore, when debating, it is also necessary to liberate the minds of the masses, establish a communist style, and overcome right-leaning conservative thinking. (2) Plan, debate, and act simultaneously, immediately showing the superiority of the People's Communes, and educating the masses with vivid facts. (3) Mobilize the masses by using the methods of the mass line, that is, adopting the methods of extensive democracy, big-character posters, and big debates, allowing the masses to raise questions themselves, educate themselves, and solve problems themselves. (4) Conduct different education for different objects.

Integrating Commune Establishment and Production into One Rope

The pilot projects in the six townships in the suburbs of Hangzhou also show that commune establishment and production are consistent. It is entirely possible to publicize commune establishment, promote production, and do a good job in production to welcome commune establishment. Commune establishment and production should be integrated into one rope, so that commune establishment becomes the driving force for promoting production and various tasks.

How commune establishment promotes production is not only a matter of understanding but also a matter of method. The experience in this regard is: First, the leading ideology must be clear, recognizing the consistency of commune establishment and production. At the beginning of the publicity, we should put forward loud and encouraging slogans and clear combat tasks, guiding the enthusiasm of the masses for establishing communes to do a good job in current production and various tasks. Because the leading ideology of each township is clear, therefore, wherever the People's Communes are publicized, there is a situation of people being encouraged, morale soaring, and production developing vigorously. While publicizing the People's Communes, Tangnan Township put forward the slogan "Vigorously engage in production, happily establish communes." The commune members were very motivated and immediately launched a production upsurge to welcome the commune. The attendance rate increased to 70% of the total population, and the amount of accumulated fertilizer in four days increased by two times compared with the amount in the eight days before the start of the People's Communes publicity. Second, taking the People's Communes as the driving force, grasp the rectification in the fields, discuss the theoretical in light of the practical, insert red flags, and pull out white flags. The production of Linping Cooperative in Shuanglin Township was relatively poor and was criticized during the field inspection. The township general branch mobilized the cooperative members to discuss "The People's Commune is a red flag, our production is a white flag, what should we do?" After discussion, the cooperative members unanimously expressed: We must pull out the white flag and participate in the People's Commune. After two days of hard work, all 230 laborers in the cooperative eliminated the 78 mu of third-class seedlings. Third, we must consistently implement the spirit of "triple harvest of ideology, commune establishment, and production" from beginning to end. The founding meeting of the commune should be an exhibition and treasure-offering meeting of production achievements in the commune establishment stage, and a mobilization meeting for the next stage, so that production can develop forward link by link and wave after wave. At the founding meeting of the People's Commune in Liangzhu Township, the ironware cooperative presented deep plows, the brick and tile factory presented refractory bricks, the electric lights of the power plant shone brightly, and the militia vanguard battalion conducted armed parades. The entire founding meeting became a meeting to publicize the superiority of the People's Communes to the masses, and also a meeting to promote current production and the next step in production.

Several Issues to Pay Attention To

The establishment of People's Communes contains fierce struggles between socialism and capitalism, collectivism and individualism, and advanced and backward ideas. Although the majority of cadres and masses actively support the establishment of communes, there are also a small number of cadres and masses, especially wealthy peasants, who have individualism and departmentalism. A small number of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists will take the opportunity to undermine production, and we must be highly vigilant about this and actively take measures to prevent and stop it.

First, we must strengthen education for party members and cadres so that they can improve their communist awareness and take a positive and correct attitude towards the establishment of communes; at the same time, we can "agree on three chapters" and formulate necessary discipline. For example, Shuanglin Township announced five disciplines at the township party members and cadres meeting: ① Without the approval of the township general branch, public accumulation is not allowed to be moved; ② Without approval, the seed grain of each cooperative is not allowed to be used; ③ Without approval, the reserve grain of each cooperative is not allowed to be distributed privately; ④ Do not sell pigs or sheep during the commune establishment period, and if it is really necessary, it must be approved by the township; ⑤ It is not allowed to cut down trees and undermine production. Because of this, the performance of the vast majority of cadres in commune establishment is good. Second, the existing cooperatives outside the pilot townships should also be widely publicized in a timely manner, so that the masses from all places and all levels can understand the nature of the People's Communes and the practices of commune establishment, in order to stabilize people's hearts and eliminate concerns. Third, in the process of establishing communes, paying attention to running the existing canteens well is a very important issue. According to Jianqiao Township, wealthy peasants fiercely oppose canteens in order to maintain their private plots and privately raised pigs and sheep. In fact, the canteen issue has become a focus of the struggle between capitalism and socialism. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen leadership and run the canteens well, and it will be easier to "cut off the tail."

    辩论远景规划启发群众自觉
    杭州郊区大办公社推动生产
    本报杭州电　浙江杭州市郊区已经取得了充分发动群众大办人民公社的试点经验。从这个市双林、塘南、良渚、笕桥、龙井、周浦六个乡分别建立人民公社的试点情况看来，整个建社过程比较顺利，基本上达到了“思想、办社、生产”三丰收的目的。根据这几个乡的经验，杭州市领导上认为在发动群众建立公社的过程中，必须掌握以下三个问题：第一、辩论远景规划，充分发动群众；第二、办社和生产拧成一条绳，互相推动，互相促进；第三、在办社中应注意的事项。
    辩论远景规划，充分发动群众
    杭州市郊区各个试点乡的情况证明，建立人民公社的确是农村中的一个重大变革，两条道路的斗争、先进和落后的斗争表现得十分尖锐，整个建社的过程就是一个思想发动的过程，也是一个共产主义思想大解放的过程。各阶层群众对人民公社大部分是积极拥护的，他们从几年来走合作化道路的切身体会中认识到人民公社肯定比高级社好。这是思想主流。但是非主流的一面也是十分复杂的。贫农和下中农考虑的问题主要是如何合理分配的问题，他们怕工农商学兵结合在一起，分配很难合理，担心搞不好生产。上中农的思想则比较动摇，顾虑重重，害怕减少收入；怕社大人多办不好；怕不自由等等。小部分特别富裕的、原来对高级社就不太满意的人，对办人民公社有抵触情绪。
    针对这些不同的思想情况，各个试点乡都开展了大张旗鼓、广泛深入的宣传和充分的思想发动，把建立人民公社变成广大人民群众的自觉要求。各个乡发动群众的方法大体上有两种：一种是从宣传人民公社的优越性着手，启发群众对办人民公社的要求；另一种是在一般地宣传人民公社优越性的基础上，分析当前大跃进的形势，摆出全乡第二个五年计划期间的远景规划和明年的生产跃进计划，发动群众就如何实现远景规划的问题开展鸣放辩论，使群众更加深刻地认清小社和生产大跃进的矛盾，自觉地要求办公社。从各个乡发动群众的广度和深度来看，后一种方法比前一种好。
    双林乡是采取后一种方法的，因而群众发动得比较深透。这个乡在一般的宣传了人民公社的优越性以后，紧接着就摆出了全乡的远景规划，发动群众鸣放辩论。他们规划全乡要实现农田水利化，农具半机械化、机械化，肥料自给化，运输车船化，电气化，土地平整化；1959年每人可以分到猪肉一百二十斤、羊肉七十多斤……。此外，还要建立人民大学、中学、幸福院、托儿所等等。根据这个远景规划，发动群众鸣放辩论三个问题：“规划好不好”、“能不能实现”、“怎样实现”。在辩论中，群众看到了幸福生活的远景，受到很大鼓舞，共写了七百多张大字报歌颂人民公社。
    在辩论到“怎样实现规划”时，群众很自然地就分析了小社不能办大事，小社不能适应生产大跃进的矛盾，自觉地要求办公社。有个人主义、本位主义思想的人，在宏伟、壮丽的远景规划面前，也感到自己在政治上太“近视”了，因而衷心拥护办公社。
    在辩论规划、发动群众的过程中，还必须注意以下几个问题：
    （一）辩论远景规划必须和总结大跃进的形势紧密地结合起来。远景规划的本身就是具有敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格的结晶，因此，在辩论时也必须解放群众的思想，树立共产主义的风格，克服右倾保守思想。（二）边规划、边辩论、边行动，立即显示人民公社的优越性，以活生生的事实去教育群众。（三）发动群众要运用群众路线的方法，即采取大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，由群众自己提问题，自己教育自己，自己解决问题。（四）要针对不同的对象，进行不同的教育。
    办公社和生产拧成一根绳
    杭州市郊区六个乡的试点还说明：办社和生产是一致的。宣传办社、推动生产，搞好生产，迎接办社是完全可以做到的。办社和生产应该拧成一根绳，使办社成为推动生产和各项工作的动力。
    办社如何推动生产，这不仅是一个认识问题，也是一个方法问题。这一方面的经验是：一、领导思想必须明确，认识到办社和生产的一致性。在开始宣传时，应该提出响亮的鼓动口号和明确的战斗任务，把群众对办公社的积极性引导到搞好当前生产和各项工作上面来。由于各乡的领导思想明确，因此，人民公社宣传到哪里，哪里就出现人心振奋、干劲冲天、生产蓬勃发展的局面。塘南乡在宣传人民公社的同时，提出“轰轰烈烈搞生产，欢欢喜喜办公社”的口号，社员干劲很高，立刻掀起了一个迎接公社的生产高潮，出勤率提高到占总人口的70％，四天的积肥数量比开展人民公社宣传前八天的数量增加两倍。二、以人民公社为动力，抓住田头整风，就实论虚，插红旗，拔白旗。双林乡临平社生产搞得较差，田间检查中受了批评，乡总支发动社员讨论“人民公社是红旗，我们的生产是白旗，怎么办？”社员讨论后一致表示：要拔掉白旗，参加人民公社。全社二百三十个劳动力经过两天苦战，七十八亩三类苗都消灭了。三、要自始至终地贯彻“思想、办社、生产”三丰收的精神，公社的成立大会，应该是一个建社阶段生产成绩展览会、献宝会，是下一个阶段的誓师大会，使生产一环扣一环，一浪推一浪地向前发展。在良渚乡的人民公社成立大会上，铁器社献深耕犁，砖瓦厂献耐火砖，发电厂的电灯大放光明，民兵先锋营进行武装游行，整个成立大会变成向群众宣传人民公社优越性的大会，也是一个推动当前生产和下一步生产的大会。
    要注意的几个问题
    在建立人民公社中，包含着社会主义和资本主义、集体主义和个人主义、先进和落后的思想激烈斗争，虽然大多数干部、群众是积极拥护办公社的，但也有少数干部和群众、特别是富裕农民，存在着个人主义和本位主义思想。少数地、富、反、坏、右更会乘机破坏生产，对此必须引起高度警惕，积极采取措施防范和制止。
    一、对党员、干部要加强教育，使他们能够提高共产主义觉悟，对建立公社采取积极、正确的态度；同时可以“约法三章”，订出必要的纪律。如双林乡就在全乡党员干部大会上宣布了五条纪律：①未经乡总支批准，公共积累一律不准动；②未经批准，各社的种籽粮不准动用；③未经批准，各社的储备粮不准私分；④不要在办社期间卖猪、卖羊，如果确实需要，要经乡同意；⑤不许砍伐树木，破坏生产。由于这样，建社中极大部分干部的表现是好的。二、对试点乡以外的合作社，也要及时进行广泛的宣传，使各个地方、各个阶层的群众都能了解人民公社的性质，了解建社的做法，以安定人心，消除顾虑。三、在办公社过程中，注意办好现有的食堂是一个十分重要的问题。据笕桥乡了解，富裕农民为了保持自留地和私养猪羊，激烈地反对食堂。实际上，食堂问题成了资本主义和社会主义斗争的一个焦点。因此，要加强领导，办好食堂，“割尾巴”就比较容易了。
