Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 20th. The workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's (WISCO) Coking Plant, based on the plant's favorable conditions, are vigorously establishing native coke ovens to produce coke for the supply of Hubei Province and WISCO's small blast furnaces for iron smelting. More than one hundred native ovens have already been built, and more than thirty have been put into production.
The native ovens they built are very simple, only requiring digging a pit in the earth, laying a layer of waste red bricks in the pit, making a ventilation duct on the side, and installing a ventilation pipe on top to produce coke; the raw material used for coking is the coal rejected from WISCO's large coke ovens.
When WISCO's Coking Plant built these one hundred-plus native ovens, apart from assigning one worker for technical guidance, the entire project was completed by the masses through voluntary labor.

    武钢炼焦厂大办炼焦土窑
    新华社武汉20日电　武钢炼焦厂职工根据本厂有利条件大办炼焦土窑，生产焦炭供应湖北省和武钢小高炉炼铁。现在已经建起一百多个土窑，并有三十多个投入生产。
    他们办的这种土窑很简单，只需挖个土坑，坑内铺一层废红砖，侧面作一个通风道，上面装一个通风管，就能炼焦生产；炼焦所用的原材料是武钢大型焦炉剔除的煤。
    武钢炼焦厂建设这一百多个土窑时，除了抽出一个工人作技术指导外，全部工程是由群众义务劳动建成的。
