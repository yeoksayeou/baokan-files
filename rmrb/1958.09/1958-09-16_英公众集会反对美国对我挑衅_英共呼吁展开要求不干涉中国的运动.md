Xinhua News Agency, London, September 14th: A mass rally protesting against U.S. provocations against China in the Taiwan Straits area was held here today in Hyde Park.

The rally passed a resolution condemning U.S. war policies and demanding that "the British government explicitly express its opposition to U.S. provocations." The resolution also demanded that the British Parliament reconvene to clearly state Britain's opposition.

This resolution has been sent to the U.S. Embassy in Britain, Macmillan, and Gaitskell.

Members of the London Garment Workers' Union have also written to the British government, stating: It should be unequivocally told to the United States that Britain will never be drawn into a war caused by its (the U.S.'s) interference in the Far East seas.

Machine workers from Dartford wrote to Prime Minister Macmillan saying that U.S. interference in China is a very serious threat to world peace.

Right-wing Labour Party MP George Brown, Labour's defense spokesman in Parliament, said tonight in Toston, South Derbyshire: "We should tell President (Eisenhower) that we simply do not want to work with him on this (Kinmen) issue, and make him know that there is no doubt about what action we will take if he goes it alone.”

Xinhua News Agency, London, September 15th: The British "Daily Worker" reported today that the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party held a meeting on the 13th and passed an appeal, calling on the British labor movement to unite the British people and launch a grand campaign demanding "non-interference in People's China."

The appeal called for the immediate reconvening of the British Parliament and demanded that emergency rallies and demonstrations be held across the country, passing resolutions and petitions to make four demands:

(1) Britain shall not support armed action against the People's Republic of China under any circumstances.

(2) The United States should immediately withdraw from Taiwan and Kinmen.

(3) Restore China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

(4) The British "representative" should be withdrawn from Taiwan.

John Gollan, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, issued a statement on the Far East issue at the meeting, condemning the U.S.'s war policy towards China. He said, "Eisenhower's (television) speech to the American people is actually a declaration of war against the People's Republic of China. This speech should shatter any illusion that the United States wants a peaceful solution to the Far East crisis."

Gollan said that no one except Eisenhower, Dulles, and Chiang Kai-shek dares to pretend for a moment that these islands are not part of Chinese territory. Gollan added that unifying China's islands with the Chinese mainland is China's internal affair and is none of anyone else's business.

Gollan pointed out that the United States is carrying out armed provocations every day, invading Chinese territorial waters, which is very likely to trigger a world war.

Gollan pointed out the root cause of the current serious situation in the Taiwan Strait, saying: "The crisis exists because Eisenhower and Dulles ignore China's legitimate demands, insist on armed occupation of Chinese territory, refuse to recognize the People's Republic, exclude China from its position in the United Nations, strengthen Chiang Kai-shek's army, and dream of ‘recovering’ China."

Gollan said: "The only way to resolve the crisis is for the U.S. military to withdraw and let the Chinese people solve their own problems."

He pointed out that although the United States verbally agreed to the proposal to hold negotiations, its actual response was Eisenhower's almost-declaration-of-war speech.

When talking about the British government's attitude, Gollan said, "If we allow the government to make Britain bear the obligation to support the U.S. military's actions in Kinmen, then we are inviting world war." Gollan called on the Communist Party to do its best to awaken the people in every town, factory, trade union organization, and labor organization where it has influence to realize the above four demands.

    英公众集会反对美国对我挑衅
    英共呼吁展开要求不干涉中国的运动
    据新华社伦敦14日电　今天在这里的海德公园举行了抗议美国在台湾海峡地区向中国挑衅的群众大会。
    大会通过了决议谴责美国战争政策，并且要求“英国政府明确表示反对美国的挑衅”。决议还要求英国议会复会以明确表示英国的反对态度。
    这个决议已经分送给美国驻英国大使馆、麦克米伦和盖次克尔。
    伦敦成衣工人工会的会员们也已经写信给英国政府，信中说：应当毫不含糊地告诉美国，英国决不卷入由于它（美国）在远东海上进行干涉而引起的战争。
    达特福特的机器工人们写信给首相麦克米伦说，美国干涉中国是对世界和平非常严重的威胁。
    右翼工党议员、工党在议会中的国防问题发言人乔治·布朗今天晚上在德尔比郡南部托斯利斯顿说：“我们应当告诉（艾森豪威尔）总统，在这个（金门）问题上我们就是不愿同他一起干的，并且使他知道：如果他单独干下去，在我们将采取什么行动这方面是没有什么疑问的。”
    据新华社伦敦15日电　英国“工人日报”今天报道，英国共产党执行委员会13日举行会议，通过了一项呼吁书，呼吁英国劳工运动团结英国人民展开盛大的要求“不干涉人民中国”的运动。
    呼吁书要求英国议会立刻复会，并且要求在全国举行紧急集会和示威，通过决议和请愿书，以提出四项要求：
    （一）英国在任何情况下都不支持反对中华人民共和国的武装行动。
    （二）美国应当立即从台湾和金门撤出。
    （三）恢复中国在联合国的合法席位。
    （四）英国的“代表”应当从台湾撤回。
    英国共产党总书记约翰·高兰在会上就远东问题发表声明，谴责美国对中国的战争政策。他说，“艾森豪威尔对美国人民的（电视）演说，实际上是对中华人民共和国的宣战书。这篇演说应当会打破任何认为美国希望和平解决远东危机的幻想。”
    高兰说，除了艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯和蒋介石以外，谁也不敢片刻地假装说这些岛屿不是中国领土的一部分。高兰又说，把中国岛屿同中国大陆统一起来是中国人民的内政，不干任何别人的事。
    高兰指出，美国每天进行武装挑衅，侵犯中国领海，这很可能触发世界大战。
    高兰指出目前台湾海峡严重局势的根源说：“危机之所以存在，是因为艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯无视中国的合法要求，坚持对中国领土进行武装占领，拒绝承认人民共和国，排斥中国在联合国中的地位，加强蒋介石军队，梦想‘收复’中国。”
    高兰说：“解决危机的唯一办法是美国军队撤出，让中国人民自己来解决他们的问题。”
    他指出，虽然美国对于举行谈判的主张口头上也表示同意，但是它的实际回答却是由艾森豪威尔发表几乎是宣战的演说。
    在谈到英国政府的态度时，高兰说，“如果我们允许政府使英国承担支持美国军队在金门的行动的义务，那么我们就是在招唤世界大战。”高兰号召共产党在它有影响的每一个城镇、工厂、工会组织和劳工组织中尽力唤醒人民来实现上述四项要求。
