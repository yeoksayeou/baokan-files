Electrification of Singing Commune

(I) The people's commune is good, extremely good, factories are built everywhere, machines roar, electric lights and telephones are common in the countryside, realizing electrification, doing more work with less manpower.
        (Henan Suiping County Folk Song)

(II) The people's commune has great power, and the commune has realized electrification. The people's commune is truly good, setting off a new upsurge of culture and science. Happiness is like a long flowing river, and the commune is like a pool of happiness. The rivers flow endlessly, and the commune will last forever.
　　    (Liang Baizhu, Huailai County, Hebei)

    歌唱公社电气化（一）人民公社好，好的不得了，遍地建工厂，机器隆隆叫，电灯和电话，乡村普遍了，实现电气化，干的活多用人少。
        （河南遂平县民歌）（二）人民公社力量大，社里实现电气化。人民公社真正好，掀起文化科学新高潮。幸福好比水流长，公社好比幸福塘。江河流水永不尽，公社地久又天长。 　　    （河北怀来县　梁柏柱）
