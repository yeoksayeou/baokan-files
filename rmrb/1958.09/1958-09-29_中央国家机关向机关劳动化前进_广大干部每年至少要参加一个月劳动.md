Central State Organs are adopting various methods to organize cadres to participate in voluntary manual labor, advancing in the direction of the laborization of offices. The participation of vast numbers of cadres in labor has become a regular system. This year, the average time spent by all cadres participating in manual labor will exceed one month.

Central State Organs attach great importance to the work of cadres participating in labor. Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on cadres participating in manual labor last May, Premier Zhou Enlai, ministers of various ministries, and many elderly and frail leading cadres have taken the lead in participating in labor. The Central State Organs established a leading group to uniformly guide cadres' participation in manual labor, headed by Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, and Qi Yanming, Deputy Secretary-General, responsible for the unified planning and inspection of cadres' participation in labor in the Central State Organs. Each organ also established special institutions such as voluntary labor committees or offices, personally headed by the main responsible cadres, to strengthen unified planning. Therefore, since February this year, when a large number of cadres from central organs participated in the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, each unit has had a certain proportion of cadres leaving their offices every day to engage in manual labor on various labor fronts.

Up to now, the methods adopted by the Central State Organs to organize cadres to participate in labor include: a large number of cadres participating in the industrial and agricultural construction and municipal construction of Beijing and its suburbs in a planned and collective manner; temporarily supporting nearby rural areas to complete rush tasks such as spring plowing and wheat harvesting; organs running their own factories and planting experimental fields; organizing cadres to participate in internal cleaning and sanitation work and canteen work; and organizing cadres to participate in labor in conjunction with going to lower levels to inspect and help with work.

Since August, following the participation of more than 60,000 cadres in the Ming Tombs Reservoir, accumulating more than 750,000 workdays, the Central State Organs, according to Beijing's overall plan to green the capital's suburbs, accepted the task of afforestation and land reclamation on 57,000 mu of mountainous land in the Changping area, and also transferred a large number of cadres to participate in the construction of highways in the suburbs of Beijing. Currently, 3,500 people from various organs have gone to the Changping area to reside and work for half a month, a month, or even two months, and another 5,000 people regularly rotate to work for one to several days. The cadres are highly motivated in their new labor tasks. In August alone, they relied on their own labor to plant more than 145,000 pine and cypress trees, and reclaimed 518 mu of wasteland, planting vegetables and buckwheat respectively. Currently, the cadres are continuing to dig fish-scale pits and contour terraces on the mountains to prepare for cultivating various trees, leveling land and accumulating fertilizer, and building their own houses in order to plant a large number of fruit trees next spring, and to prepare conditions for more cadres to go to work. The slogan put forward is: "Fight hard for three to five years, turn slopes into terraces, make mountains water conservancy, turn sandy land into good farmland, turn barren mountains into orchards, and turn poor mountains into rich mountains." Units such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, and the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power are also preparing to set aside some land as experimental fields to study issues related to national mountain construction and afforestation technology through cadre labor.

While uniformly organizing vast numbers of cadres to participate in manual labor, the Central State Organs have set up hundreds of "Red and Expert" factories and planted many experimental fields in recent months. The units under the First Ministry of Machine Building have set up more than 50 "Red and Expert" factories to date, and the workers in these factories are all on-the-job cadres. The Ministry of Agriculture, from the minister to cadres at all levels, has planted 61 mu of experimental fields in Beijing. In addition, many organs have cadres taking turns to do all the cleaning and sanitation work from office cleaning to public toilet cleaning. Leading cadres and on-the-job cadres at all levels of units such as the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have all gone to mines, factories, and basic construction sites to participate in labor with workers during their recent in-depth inspections and assistance work at the lower levels.

After the institutionalization of cadre participation in labor, a large number of leaders and vast numbers of cadres often appear among the masses as ordinary laborers, the relationship between the organs and cadres and the masses has become closer, and the situation of cadres' thinking and organs being divorced from reality has also been greatly improved. Some cadres who originally suffered from neurasthenia and other chronic diseases and could only work for half a day have been able to work full days after labor exercise. At present, although the average time spent by all cadres in the Central State Organs participating in labor this year may exceed one month, there are still some cadres who should participate in labor who have not yet worked, or who have worked for less time. Therefore, each unit is continuing to strengthen planning and more rationally arrange the time for cadres to participate in labor and organ work, to ensure that all cadres who are able to work must work for at least one month each year.

### 中央国家机关向机关劳动化前进  广大干部每年至少要参加一个月劳动

    中央国家机关向机关劳动化前进
    广大干部每年至少要参加一个月劳动
    本报讯  中央国家机关采取各种方式组织干部参加义务体力劳动，向着机关劳动化的方向前进，广大干部参加劳动已经形成一种经常的制度。今年全体干部参加体力劳动的时间，平均将超过一个月。
    中央国家机关对干部参加劳动这一工作十分重视。自从去年5月中共中央发布关于干部参加体力劳动的指示以后，周恩来总理、各部部长和不少年老体弱的领导干部都带头参加劳动。中央国家机关成立了统一领导干部参加体力劳动的领导小组，由国务院习仲勋秘书长和齐燕铭副秘书长负责，专门负责中央国家机关干部参加劳动的统一规划和检查工作。各机关也分别成立了义务劳动委员会或办公室等专门机构，由主要负责干部亲自挂帅，加强统一计划。因此，自从今年2月中央机关大批干部参加十三陵水库的建设工程以来，各单位每天都有一定比例的干部走出了办公室，在各种劳动战线上进行体力劳动。
    到目前为止，中央国家机关所采取的组织干部参加劳动的方式，已有大批干部有计划地集体参加北京市和郊区的工农业建设和市政建设；临时支援附近农村完成春耕、麦收等突击任务；各机关自办工厂和种试验田；组织干部参加机关内部的清洁卫生工作和食堂工作；以及组织干部结合深入下层检查和帮助工作时参加劳动等各种方式。
    8月以来，中央国家机关继六万多干部在十三陵水库劳动了七十五万多个工作日以后，又根据北京市绿化首都郊区的总规划，接受了在昌平地区五万七千亩山地造林和垦荒的任务，同时还抽调了大批干部参加了北京郊区的公路建设。目前，各机关已有三千五百人前往昌平地区常住劳动半个月、一个月以至两个月，另外还有五千人经常轮流去劳动一天到几天。干部们在新的劳动任务中积极性很高。仅仅8月份一个月内，他们依靠自己的劳动双手，已经种植松柏树十四万五千多棵，开垦出荒地五百一十八亩，并且分别种了蔬菜和荞麦。目前，干部们正在山地上继续挖掘准备培植各种树木的鱼鳞坑和水平沟，整地积肥，自建房屋，以便明年春天大量种植果树，并且为更多的干部前往劳动准备好条件。人们提出的口号是：“苦战三、五年，坡地梯田化，山地水利化，砂地成良田，荒山成为花果山，穷山变富山”。科学院、农业部、林业部、水利电力部等单位，还准备划出一部分土地做为试验田，通过干部劳动来研究有关全国山区建设和造林技术的一些问题。
    在统一组织广大干部参加体力劳动的同时，中央国家机关在最近几个月内办起了成百个红专工厂，种了许多试验田。第一机械工业部所属各单位，到目前为止已办起红专工厂五十多座，这些工厂的工人全部是在职干部。农业部从部长到各级干部，在北京种的试验田有六十一亩。此外，许多机关从办公室的清洁卫生直到公共厕所的打扫工作，已全部由干部轮流包做。煤炭工业部、化学工业部、冶金工业部等单位的领导干部和各级在职干部，在最近深入下层检查和帮助工作时，都曾到矿坑、工厂和基本建设工地，同工人一起参加了劳动。
    干部参加劳动形成制度以后，大批领导人员和广大干部都经常以普通劳动者的面貌在群众中出现，各机关和干部同群众的关系更加密切了，干部思想和机关脱离实际的状况也有了很大改进。有些干部原来患有神经衰弱等慢性病，只能半天工作，经过劳动锻炼，已经能够全天工作。目前，中央国家机关全体干部今年参加劳动的时间，平均起来虽可以超过一个月，但还有一部分应该参加劳动的干部还没有劳动，或者劳动时间较少。因此，各单位正在继续加强计划性，更合理地安排干部参加劳动的时间和机关工作，保证做到凡是能够劳动的干部每年至少都要劳动一个月。
