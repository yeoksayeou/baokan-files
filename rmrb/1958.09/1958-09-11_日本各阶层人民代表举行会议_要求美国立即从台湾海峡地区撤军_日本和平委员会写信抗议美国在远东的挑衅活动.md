Xinhua News Agency, September 9th, Tokyo Dispatch: More than 300 representatives from over 20 Japanese people's organizations, including peace, friendship, labor unions, women, youth, and trade groups, held a meeting in Tokyo today, demanding that the United States unconditionally accept Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Straits area to end the tense situation in the Far East.

The Japanese People's Representatives Conference, jointly convened by The National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan Peace Committee, and the Japan Asia Solidarity Committee, unanimously passed a resolution strongly condemning the United States for creating tension in the Far East. It demanded that the United States immediately withdraw all armed forces, including the Seventh Fleet, from the Taiwan area, cease transporting nuclear weapons into Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, and abandon its plan to establish a Northeast Asia military alliance. The resolution also strongly protested against the United States occupying military bases in Japan and Okinawa.

The meeting also passed a resolution demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government refuse the United States' use of bases in Okinawa and throughout Japan for armed provocations and make public to the Japanese people the results of negotiations with the United States on this issue.

The resolution demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government sever all relations with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, establish normal peaceful and friendly relations with China and restore diplomatic relations, and urge the United States military to immediately withdraw from Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, cease arming Japan with nuclear weapons, and refuse to participate in the Northeast Asia military alliance.

The meeting unanimously agreed that the movement launched by the Japanese people to ease tension in the Far East and prevent the U.S.-Chiang war provocations against China must be closely coordinated with all mass movements, such as banning nuclear weapons, restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations, and opposing the "Performance Rating" system. The meeting decided that the various groups participating in the meeting should immediately organize mass movements, and at the same time, called on other groups to launch a joint struggle to stop the U.S.-Chiang war provocations and ease the tension in the Far East.

The meeting also decided to publish an "Appeal to the Japanese People" on the 12th, calling on the people to organize large-scale mass movements.

Xinhua News Agency, September 10th: According to a TASS dispatch from Tokyo on September 9th, the Japan Peace Committee wrote a letter to the U.S. government on September 9th, protesting U.S. provocative actions in the Far East.

The letter pointed out that the United States should bear full responsibility for the current escalation of tension in the Taiwan Straits area. The United States has invaded China's Taiwan Island and supported the Chiang Kai-shek clique in carrying out provocations against the People's Republic of China. The Japan Peace Committee protested against the United States using its military bases in Japan and Okinawa Island to escalate tensions in the Taiwan area and demanded that the U.S. government immediately withdraw U.S. armed forces from the Taiwan area, not deploy nuclear weapons in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and abandon its plan to organize a new aggressive bloc—the Northeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The Japan Peace Committee also issued an appeal, demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government refuse the U.S. plan to use bases in Japan to carry out aggressive provocations against China. The appeal demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government sever all relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and establish normal friendly relations with the People's Republic of China.
