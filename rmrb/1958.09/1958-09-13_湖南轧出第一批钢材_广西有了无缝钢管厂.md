    Hunan Rolls Out First Batch of Steel
    Guangxi Has Seamless Steel Pipe Plant
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 12th: The newly built rolling mill workshop of the Zhuzhou Iron and Steel Plant recently rolled out the first batch of self-produced steel in the province.
    The three-roller rolling mill installed in this workshop has a roll diameter of 250 millimeters and was recently rushed into production by Zhuzhou City. It can roll round steel, square steel, angle steel, light rails, and ribbed steel, with an annual production capacity of 10,000 tons.
    This newspaper reports: The first seamless steel pipe plant in Guangxi, jointly established by the Wuzhou Sugar Factory, Shipyard, and Machinery Factory, has recently been completed.
    All the piercing machine parts in this factory were made in-house. During the casting of the parts, the workers boldly innovated, using inoculated cast iron and white cast iron to replace cast steel; using hand hammers and hand drills to replace air hammers and radial drills; and using small planers to replace large planers. Now, this factory is preparing to expand, planning to add rolling mills, pipe rolling machines, and cold drawing machines in order to produce seamless steel pipes of various diameters and lengths, as well as various types of steel in batches.

    湖南轧出第一批钢材
    广西有了无缝钢管厂
    新华社长沙12日电　株洲市钢铁厂新建的轧钢车间最近轧出了全省第一批自产钢材。
    这个车间安装的轧辊直径为二百五十公厘的三联轧钢机，是株洲市最近赶制出来的。它能轧制圆钢、方钢、角钢、轻便钢轨和竹节钢，年产能力为一万吨。
    本报讯　梧州市糖厂、造船厂、机械厂联合筹建的广西第一座无缝钢管厂已在最近建成。
    这个厂全部穿孔机的机件均为自制。在机件铸造过程中，职工们大胆独创，用孕育铸铁、白口生铁来代替铸钢；用手工锤和手钻代替空气锤和摇臂钻；用小刨床代替大刨床。现在，这个厂又在准备着手扩建，计划增加轧钢机、轧管机、冷拔机，以便成批生产各种口径和长短不同的无缝钢管及各种型钢。
