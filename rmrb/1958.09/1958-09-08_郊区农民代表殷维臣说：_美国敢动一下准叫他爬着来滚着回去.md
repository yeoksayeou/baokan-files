Suburban Farmer Representative Yin Weichen Says:
　　America Dares to Move and We'll Make Sure They Crawl In and Roll Out!
    Yesterday evening, the five thousand-plus members of the Shangyou People's Commune in our Fengtai District heard Premier Zhou's statement on behalf of our government. Upon learning that American imperialism blatantly threatened to expand its aggression against our country in the Taiwan area, everyone was furious. More than five thousand commune members, who had just returned from deep plowing, didn't even eat dinner before staging a massive demonstration in the rain.
    This American imperialist wolf still imagines it can help its foster son Chiang Kai-shek bully the Chinese people like in the past. It's simply daydreaming with its eyes open, and it will never succeed. It doesn't even look in the mirror to see how capable it is, nor does it think about the lessons of being beaten in the past. When Beijing was about to be liberated, even before the People's Liberation Army arrived, those unscrupulous American soldiers ran away with their tails between their legs! In Korea, American imperialism helped the traitor Syngman Rhee bully the Korean people, but couldn't withstand a head-on blow from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and was forced to abandon its armor and retreat south of the 38th parallel. The veterans and militiamen of our commune all said: The American devils are blind. They don't realize how strong the Chinese people's fists are and how straight their backs are after the Great Leap Forward. They still want to interfere with our liberation of Jinmen and Mazu, which is simply trying to break ground on Tai Sui's head and pull hair from a tiger's mouth. As long as they dare to touch us with a finger, we guarantee to make them crawl in and roll out!
    Now, we have established a militia reserve division. All ten thousand officers and soldiers of our division unanimously request that guns be issued immediately, training be intensified, production be done well in peacetime, war be waged against the earth, and we are ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland, go to the front line, and strike the enemy.
    We have endured enough of the imperialists' arrogance. The people of Taiwan, Jinmen, and Mazu have suffered the arrogance of Japanese imperialism in the past, and are still suffering the oppression of American imperialism and Chiang's bandits. Our hearts are connected to theirs, and we must never let them be bullied again. All the militiamen of our commune have unanimously expressed their determination to actively respond to the call of the Supreme State Conference, to be ready at any time to go to the front line, defend the motherland, and strike any enemy who dares to invade our country.

　　郊区农民代表殷维臣说：
　　美国敢动一下准叫他爬着来滚着回去
    我们丰台区上游人民公社的五万多社员，昨天傍黑，听到了周总理代表我国政府发表的声明，知道美帝国主义公然威胁在台湾地区要扩大对我国的侵略范围，大家伙都气坏了，有五千多社员刚从深翻地里回来，连饭都没吃，就顶着雨游行大示威。
    美帝这只野心狼，还想像过去帮助干儿子蒋介石欺负中国人民，简直是睁着眼睛在做梦，一辈子也办不到了。他也不照照镜子，看看自己有多大能耐，也不想想过去挨揍的教训。北京刚要解放的时候，人民解放军还没有到，那些不办人事的美国兵就夹着尾巴跑啦！在朝鲜，美帝帮着卖国贼李承晚欺负朝鲜人民，经不住朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军当头一捧，就丢盔撂甲，滚回三八线以南去了。我们公社的志愿军战士和民兵们都说：美国鬼子瞎了眼，也不想想中国人民大跃进以后，拳头有多大，腰板有多硬，还想来干涉咱们解放金门、马祖，简直是想在太岁头上动土，老虎嘴上拔毛，只要敢动咱们一指头，准保叫他爬着来，滚着回去！
    现在，我们已成立了民兵预备师。我们全师一万官兵，一致要求，马上发枪，加紧练兵，平时，搞好生产，向地球开战，并且随时准备响应祖国的号召，开上前线，打击敌人。
    帝国主义的气我们是受够了，台湾和金门、马祖的人民，过去受过日本帝国主义的气，现在还在受着美帝国主义和蒋贼军的欺压，我们和他们心连着心，我们绝不能再让他们受欺负。我们公社的全体民兵都一致表示决心，积极响应最高国务会议的号召，随时准备到前线去，保卫祖国，打击胆敢侵犯我国的敌人。（天津美术出版社供稿）
