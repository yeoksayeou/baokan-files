    Liberating Taiwan is Everyone's Responsibility
    Farmers Must Produce More Grain for the Country
    After our Guanhutun Brigade of the Zhengzhou North Suburb People's Commune participated in the demonstration parade in Chenzhai against U.S. imperialism's interference in our internal affairs, the Party branch and brigade committee immediately proposed: we must use the practical action of producing more grain to oppose U.S. imperialism's occupation of our territory of Taiwan. That evening, all the commune members fought hard all night, deep plowing twenty mu of land (two chi deep), applying two million jin of base fertilizer. While working, the commune members sang: "Dig up grass roots, eliminate enemy roots, liberate Taiwan, everyone has a share!" "Our enthusiasm breaks through the earth and rushes through the sky, guaranteeing that next year's wheat will increase dozens of times. Launch satellites into the sky, making the American imperialists tremble with fear, and the people of the whole country are happy. Go all out to liberate Taiwan and let imperialism be completely finished!" Zhengzhou North Suburb People's Commune, Kong Fanlu
    The 10,200 commune members of Wuji Township, Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, while cheering the establishment of the People's Commune, angrily denounced the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism. At the commune members' meeting, everyone expressed their determination to resolutely support the liberation of Taiwan by running the commune well, doing a good job in agricultural production, and striving for a bumper harvest of late autumn crops. A comrade from the agricultural middle school even composed a quick-clapper rhyme: "U.S. imperialism invades Taiwan Island, the Chinese people denounce it in unison, warn Eisenhower, quickly cancel your daydream. If you dare to launch a war of aggression, dig your own grave and bring your own shovel."
        Wuji Township, Shuyang County, Zhou San

    解放台湾人人有份
    农民们要给国家生产更多粮食
    我们郑州北郊人民公社关虎屯中队，在陈砦参加反对美帝国主义干涉我国内政的示威游行大会以后，党支部和队委会即提出：要用多打粮食的实际行动，来反对美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾。当晚，全体社员就大战了一夜，深翻地二十亩（深翻二尺），施基肥二百万斤。社员一面工作，一面歌唱：“挖掘草根，消灭敌根，解放台湾，人人有份。”“我们的干劲蹬破地球冲破天，保证明年小麦翻它几十番。放出卫星钻上天，美帝看见打颤颤，全国人民心喜欢。鼓足干劲解放台湾，让帝国主义彻底完蛋！”郑州北郊人民公社　孔繁露
    我们江苏省沭阳县吴集乡的一万零二百个社员，一面欢呼人民公社成立，一面愤怒地声讨美帝国主义的侵略罪行。在社员大会上，个个都表示了决心，坚决以办好公社，搞好农业生产，争取晚秋作物大丰收，来支援解放台湾。农业中学的一位同志还编了一首快板：“美帝侵略台湾岛，中国人民齐声讨，警告艾森豪威尔，白日迷梦快取消。若敢发动侵略战，自掘坟墓自带锹。”
