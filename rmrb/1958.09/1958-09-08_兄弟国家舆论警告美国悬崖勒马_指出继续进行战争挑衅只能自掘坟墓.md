Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 7th. "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today entitled "U.S. Imperialists Should Immediately Stop Provocative Acts in the Taiwan Strait," stating that the Chinese government's declaration regarding Chinese territory is a stern warning from 600 million Chinese people against the U.S. imperialists' attempt to prolong the occupation of Taiwan and their provocative acts against the Chinese people. The Korean people fully support this resolute measure by the Chinese government to recover its own territory.

The editorial emphasized that the Korean people cannot but be concerned about the U.S. imperialists' provocative acts against the Chinese people, and any act of aggression against the Chinese people is a serious threat to the Korean people. The editorial pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' military adventures in the Taiwan area are not only a new war plot against the People's Republic of China, but also a direct and serious challenge to world peace.

The editorial warned that the U.S. imperialists' military adventures can only lead to digging their own graves. The editorial emphasized that the Chinese people have ample strength to give the aggressors a deserved counterattack.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 7th. The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan" published a commentary today stating that whoever violates China's territorial waters is an aggressor.

The commentary condemned the U.S. imperialists' provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait and their plot to "not recognize" China's regulations on territorial waters. The commentary pointed out that the Chinese government's declaration regarding territorial waters is a very legitimate matter for safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity, and it has received enthusiastic support from peace-loving people around the world.

The commentary said that as a fraternal country of China, Vietnam's territorial waters are connected to China's territorial waters. U.S. imperialism is interfering in South Vietnam and hindering Vietnam's reunification. The Vietnamese people fully support the Chinese government's declaration on territorial waters and actively support the Chinese people's just struggle. The Vietnamese people demand that the United States not violate China's territorial waters and must withdraw its troops from the Taiwan area and other Asian countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 7th. "Rude Pravo" pointed out that the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait has not been eliminated. The United States is still constantly gathering military forces in the Pacific, attempting to insist on pushing its notorious "brink of war" policy. The newspaper emphasized that the Chinese people, with the support of world public opinion, are firmly determined to exercise their right to liberate their coastal islands, which is entirely China's internal affair. World opinion unanimously demands that the aggressors should retreat.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, September 6th. The "Zeri i Popullit" pointed out that the United States' shameless provocative actions against the People's Republic of China have aroused great anger from the world public. The world public is increasingly aware of the dangerous consequences caused by the United States' "brink of war" policy.

The newspaper said that, obviously, the U.S. aggressors have not learned useful lessons from the deplorable past. But the Chinese people's patience is limited. The Chinese people will never allow the coastal islands, which have belonged to it since ancient times, to be used by the enemies of peace as a springboard for attacking China. Therefore, the People's Republic of China is prepared to resolutely give the warmongers' conspiracies a devastating rebuff. It has the means and the possibility to do this.

　　兄弟国家舆论警告美国悬崖勒马
    指出继续进行战争挑衅只能自掘坟墓
　　朝鲜
    据新华社平壤7日电“劳动新闻”今天发表题为“美帝国主义者应立即停止在台湾海峡的挑衅行为”的社论说，中华人民共和国政府关于中国领土的声明是六亿中国人民对美帝国主义者企图把强占台湾长期化和反对中国人民的挑衅行为的严厉的警告，朝鲜人民完全支持中华人民共和国政府为恢复自己领土的这一坚决措施。
    社论强调说，朝鲜人民对于美帝国主义者对中国人民的挑衅行为不能不关心，对中国人民的任何侵略行为也就是对朝鲜人民的严重威胁。社论指出，美帝国主义者在台湾地区的军事冒险，不仅是反对中华人民共和国的新战争阴谋，并且是对世界和平的直接的严重的挑战。
    社论警告说，美帝国主义者的军事冒险只能带来自掘坟墓的结果。社论强调说，中国人民有充分的力量给予侵略者应得的反击。
    越南
    据新华社河内7日电越南“人民报”今天发表评论说，谁侵犯中国的领海，谁就是侵略者。
    评论谴责美帝国主义在台湾海峡的挑衅行为和所谓“不承认”中国关于领海的规定的阴谋。评论指出，中国政府关于领海的声明是为了维护主权和领土完整的一件非常正当的事情，它得到世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持。
    评论说，作为中国的一个兄弟国家，越南的领海同中国领海相连，美帝国主义正在干涉南越，阻挠越南的统一。越南人民完全赞成中国政府关于领海的声明，并且积极支持中国人民的正义斗争。越南人民要求美国不得侵犯中国的领海，并且必须从台湾地区和亚洲其他国家撤军。
　　捷克斯洛伐克
    据新华社布拉格7日电　“红色权利报”指出，台湾海峡的紧张局势并未消除，美国还在太平洋上不断聚集军事力量，企图坚持推行它那恶名昭彰的“战争边缘”政策。报纸强调说，有着全世界舆论支持的中国人民，坚定地要执行解放自己的沿海岛屿的权利，这完全是中国的内政。世界舆论一致要求侵略者应该缩回去。
　　阿尔巴尼亚
    据新华社地拉那6日电　“人民之声报”指出，美国对中华人民共和国的无耻挑衅行为引起了世界公众的极大愤怒。世界公众越来越感到美国“战争边缘”政策所引起的危险后果。
    报纸说，显然，美国侵略者没有从可悲的过去吸取有益的教训。但是中国人民的忍耐是有限度的。中国人民决不允许自古以来就属于它的沿海岛屿被和平公敌用来作为进攻中国的跳板。因此中华人民共和国准备坚决给予战争贩子的阴谋以毁灭性的回击。它完全有办法、有可能作到这点。
