Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Premier Zhou Enlai met with Algerian student representatives Shalal and Malik this afternoon. He expressed his firm belief that the Algerian people will grow stronger and more aware in their anti-colonialist struggle. He stated they would undoubtedly persevere in their struggle, support the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, and resolutely oppose the French colonial rulers until Algeria achieves complete independence.

　　Premier Zhou enthusiastically said to the two representatives: "You should be commended, and congratulated, congratulated on the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. You stand on the front lines of the anti-colonialist struggle and have achieved significant victories. The Chinese people, the Arab people, the Asian and African people, and all peace-loving people around the world, like the Algerian people, are immensely pleased with your victory."

　　Shalal is the chairman of the General Union of Algerian Muslim Students, and Malik is a member of the guiding committee of this student union and a special correspondent for "El Moudjahid," the newspaper of the Algerian National Liberation Front. When they told Premier Zhou that they had only heard about the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria after arriving in China, and how quickly the good news had spread, Premier Zhou pointed out: "There are many events happening in the world now, and the international situation is developing rapidly, and every event is beneficial to the anti-colonialist people and peace-loving people."

　　Shalal and Malik told Premier Zhou: Although the Algerian people have taken a big step forward in their struggle for national independence, they must continue to persevere in the struggle, and be vigilant and fight back against the more brutal oppression of the French colonialists at any time. Premier Zhou agreed with the views of the two representatives and believed that the Algerian people would surely continue to achieve new and greater victories. He said: "The Chinese people have also experienced this long and arduous struggle, and this journey is not yet completely over. To this day, the United States still occupies China's territory of Taiwan and is carrying out rampant provocations against China. From this, it can also be proved that oppressed nations must rely on their own strength to fight tirelessly and persistently in order to achieve true independence and survival."

　　Premier Zhou finally said to the two representatives: "The current international situation is favorable to your struggle. First of all, the people in your country are becoming more and more united, and the Arab and African people are becoming more and more united. You have more and more friends, and the French colonialists are becoming more and more isolated. Relying on the growing strength of the people, you will surely overcome the difficulties on the road ahead and achieve greater victories in the struggle."

    周总理在接见阿尔及利亚学生代表时说
    被压迫民族只有坚持奋战  才能获得真正独立和生存
    新华社25日讯  周恩来总理在今天下午接见阿尔及利亚学生代表沙拉尔和马利克时，表示坚信阿尔及利亚人民在反殖民主义斗争中将越战越强，觉悟越来越高，他们必定会坚持斗争，支持阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府，坚决反对法国殖民统治者，直到阿尔及利亚取得完全的独立。
    周恩来总理热情地对两位代表说：应该赞扬你们，庆贺你们，庆贺阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立。你们站在反殖民主义斗争的最前线，并且取得了重大胜利。中国人民、阿拉伯人民、亚非人民以至全世界爱好和平的人民，都同阿尔及利亚人民一样，为你们的胜利而感到无限高兴。
    沙拉尔是阿尔及利亚穆斯林学生总会的主席，马利克是这个学生总会的指导委员会委员和阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线机关报“圣战者报”特派记者。当他们向周总理谈到他们到了中国才听到阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府成立，捷报传来是如此迅速时，周总理指出：现在世界上事变很多，国际局势发展很快，而每一个事变都对反殖民主义的人民和爱好和平的人民有利。
    沙拉尔和马利克向周总理表示：阿尔及利亚人民虽然在民族独立斗争中跨进了一大步，但必须继续坚持斗争，随时警惕和反击法国殖民者的更残酷的压迫。周总理同意两位代表的看法，并且相信阿尔及利亚人民必定会不断取得新的更大的胜利。他说：中国人民也经历过这种长期艰苦斗争的路程，并且这个路程现在还没有完全结束，至今美国还霸占着中国的领土台湾，并且向中国进行猖狂的挑衅。从这里也可以证明，被压迫的民族必须依靠自己的力量奋战不已，坚持不懈，才能取得真正的独立和生存。
    周总理最后对两位代表说：现在国际形势对你们的斗争有利。而首先是你们国内的人民越来越团结，阿拉伯人民和非洲人民越来越团结。你们的朋友越来越多，而法国殖民者越来越孤立。依靠人民日益增长的强大力量，你们一定会战胜前进道路上的困难，在斗争中取得更大的胜利。
