Inspiration, Encouragement, Strength
—A Special Feature on the Opening of the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition
　　By our reporter

“Arduous efforts, tremendous achievements, soaring drive, and a brilliant future.” This was the impression expressed to the reporter by a Shanghai resident after visiting the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition. His impression reflects the common sentiment of the audience on the first day of the exhibition.

Today, Beijing is bathed in bright sunshine. At nine o'clock in the morning, as the golden sun shone on the towering gilded iron tower of the Beijing Exhibition Center, the archway of the central hall with its octagonal dome opened. The magnificent and joyful song "Ode to the Motherland" was broadcast from the loudspeakers. The first group of spectators, who had been waiting in front of the lotus-shaped fountain in the square, strode into the long-awaited exhibition hall with excitement.

Following the flow of visitors, the reporter heard people praising the great achievements on our industrial and transportation fronts. I listened to the explanations and took notes with them, sharing their excitement and joy. Many visitors from more than a dozen provinces and cities across the country mentioned that the magnificent exhibition is like the best school, from which they have gained a lot of inspiration, encouragement, and strength.

People flooded into the Metallurgical Hall and were immediately attracted by the giant steel ingots, aluminum ingots, and models of various advanced small blast furnaces and small converters. Many people shared a common aspiration: to learn from here and let the iron and steel "marshals" in various places mount galloping steeds. Here, the reporter met Zhang Jinhua, the director of the Heavy Industry Bureau of Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province. As soon as he arrived at the exhibition, he saw the simple methods of producing blowers, such as ceramic blowers and simple blowers made by the Shenyang Fan Factory, and a special kind of joy appeared on his face. He said: "We have ceramic factories in Zhuzhou, and we have already obtained the drawings of the simple blowers made in Shenyang. It won't be long before we can have our own blowers to equip steelmaking furnaces."

Visitors from Fujian Province and the Taihang and Lüliang Mountains in Shanxi Province were as happy as Zhang Jinhua. Chen Ming, the chairman of the trade union of a car repair factory in Fuzhou City, saw the model of a hand-operated small converter created by the Guxian Iron Plant in Shanxi Province and regarded it as a treasure, observing it from all angles for a long time. He told reporters: "We can promote this kind of small converter. In the past, Fujian Province had no iron or steel industry, but this year our factory alone is preparing to produce 4,000 tons of steel." Zhao Aicheng, a cadre from the Handicraft Industry Federation of Xiyang County in the Taihang Mountains, said that the Xiyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed the goal of "every household making iron" throughout the county. This visit will bring the advanced experience in furnace construction and operation back to the Taihang Mountains.

Many "native" machines and "native" methods exhibited at the exhibition, like precise and heavy machines, were praised by the audience and gave many visitors great inspiration.

Next to the "ants gnawing at bones" model in the East Square, crowds of people were densely packed all day long. At ten o'clock in the morning, a person squeezed into the model from the crowd, first measured the size of the locomotive head with a pencil, and then carefully watched the shape of the cutting tools. He is Liu Liming, the party branch secretary of the metalworking workshop of the Guiyang Electric Motor Factory. This factory used to only be able to manufacture generators of 20 to 40 kilowatts, but now it wants to manufacture generators of 500 kilowatts. Because there was no large boring machine, the workers had to use chisels to flatten the generator casing, which was inefficient and of poor quality. When he saw the "ants gnawing at bones," he was extremely happy. He looked at it, walked away, and came back to look at it again, visiting the model five times in a row. Several power plant repair workshops in Shanghai, in order to ensure that the steel "marshal" takes command and overcome the shortage of electricity, decided to jointly manufacture a 12,000-kilowatt generator this year. However, without large machine tools for processing, the workers were very worried. Now, after people from the Zhabei Power Plant and the Yangshupu Power Plant came to visit, they also found the key to solving this difficulty, and that key is "ants gnawing at bones."

Regarding the issue of "native" and "foreign," visitors from Shanghai have particularly profound experiences. The looms for weaving colored cloth in the Shanghai Jiu'an Dyeing and Weaving Factory are all imported goods, and a piece of cloth can only weave up to four colors. However, there is a "native" loom at the exhibition that can weave six colors on a piece of cloth. Weng Zhaolin, a technician at the Jiu'an Dyeing and Weaving Factory, compared the two looms to reporters and said that this "native" loom further liberated his mind and made him deeply realize that many "native" methods are better than "foreign" methods. Weng Zhaolin has already sketched this "native" loom and plans to go back to the factory to modify their imported goods.

Many visitors were encouraged after today's visit and resolved to speed up the work they had originally arranged. There is a folk song in the Transportation Hall that describes the heroic deeds of realizing a river network in the Wanbei area: "In the past, it was a disaster zone, but this year the river network has been opened. Steamships tow wooden boats, transporting fertilizer and grain. Every township has running water, every village has a dock, dry land has been converted into paddy fields, and there are bumper harvests every year." Liu Chunhua, director of the Local Transportation Department of the Hunan Provincial Department of Transportation, told reporters after seeing the model of the river network in Wanbei that Hunan's conditions for implementing "one network (water network), twoizations (transportation vesselization, irrigation self-flowization)" were originally better, but now only three townships in the Dongting Lake area have achieved "one network, twoizations." This time, seeing the heroic spirit of the people of Wanbei "turning Wanbei into Jiangnan" is a great encouragement to us in Hunan, which is located in Jiangnan. This winter and next spring, Hunan Province will basically achieve irrigation self-flowization. We plan to combine the construction of irrigation canal networks and realize transportation vesselization in all areas where conditions permit—achieving canals "encircling fields and surrounding houses," and ships can reach the edge of the fields. Zhang Jiaji, the head of the Dongfanghong People's Commune in Huxian County, Shaanxi, said after seeing the small hydropower, biogas, and wind power stations by the Houhu Lake in the exhibition hall that he used to think that running industry was very mysterious, but now it seems not difficult. After returning, at least each of the eight production teams in the entire commune will build a small hydropower station.

It was in this magnificent exhibition hall of the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition that the Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition of our great brotherly country—the Soviet Union—was held four years ago. At that time, people said hopefully: The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. However, in just a few years, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, thanks to the vigorous efforts of the people of the whole country and the brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union, the technical seeds sown here four years ago have blossomed and borne fruit today. Wu Enqi, the director of the Tianjin No. 2 Power Plant, who visited the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition here at that time, told reporters today: "In just four years, our country has made such rapid progress! It is no problem to catch up with the UK in fifteen years!"

In the evening, the red star on the gold-plated spire of the exhibition hall lit up. The water lilies in the lotus-shaped fountain in the square slowly closed their crimson petals. However, some viewers still lingered in the square, reluctant to leave. Perhaps they were reliving the rich memories of today! Today, for every visitor, is a day they will never forget in their lives. (September 15)

    启发  鼓舞  力量
    ——全国工业交通展览会开幕特写
　　本报记者
    “艰苦的努力，巨大的成就，冲天的干劲，光辉的前景。”这是上海市的一位观众在参观了全国工业交通展览会后，对记者发表的观感。他的这个印象，反映了展览会开幕第一天观众共同的心声。
    今天，北京市晴空万里。上午九时，当金色的朝阳照耀着北京展览馆高耸的镏金铁塔时，八角穹顶的圆柱中央大厅的拱门开启了。扬声器里送来雄壮、欢悦的“歌唱祖国”的歌声，静候在广场上莲式喷水池前的第一批观众，怀着兴奋的心情，迈开大步，跑进了他们期待已久的展览馆。
    记者随着参观的人流，听到人们交口不绝地赞扬我们工业、交通战线上的伟大成就，跟他们一起听讲解、记笔记，和他们一起分享着兴奋和喜悦。来自全国各地十多个省市的许多观众谈到，规模宏伟的展览会像一所最好的学校，他们从这里得到了很多启示、鼓舞和力量。
    人们涌进冶金馆，立刻为巨型钢锭、铝锭和各种先进的小高炉、小转炉的模型所吸引，许多人怀着一个共同的心愿：要从这里取经，让各地的钢铁“元帅”跨上飞驰的骏马。在这里，记者遇到了湖南株洲市重工业局局长张锦华。他一到展览会，看到生产鼓风机的简易方法，像陶瓷鼓风机，沈阳扇风机厂做的简易鼓风机等产品，脸上流露着一种特有的高兴。他说：“我们株洲有陶瓷厂，我们已经拿到了沈阳做的简易鼓风机的图纸，不要多久，我们就可以有自己的鼓风机装备炼钢炉了。”
    来自福建省和山西省太行山区、吕梁山区的观众们，也像张锦华一样高兴。福州市某汽车修理厂的工会主席陈明，看到山西省故县铁厂创造的手摇小转炉的模型，如获至宝，前后左右观察了好半天。他对记者说：“这种小转炉，我们能推广。过去福建省是手无寸铁，今年光是我们工厂，就准备生产四千吨钢。”太行山区昔阳县手工业联合社的干部赵爱成表示，中共昔阳县委已经提出全县“户户炼铁”的奋斗目标，这次来参观，要把先进的建炉经验和操作经验，带回太行山去。
    展览会展出的许多“土”机器、“土”办法，像精密的、重型的机器一样，受到观众们的赞扬，而且给了许多观众很大的启发。
    东广场上的“蚂蚁啃骨头”的模型旁边，整日围着密密层层的人群。上午十时，有一个人从人缝里挤进模型下面，先用铅笔测量了车头的尺寸，又仔细观看刀具的形状。他是贵阳电机厂金工车间的党支部书记刘利明。这个工厂原来只能制造二十至四十瓩的发电机，而现在却要制造五百瓩的发电机，因为没有大镗床，工人只好用凿子削平发电机外壳，效率低，质量也不好。当他看到“蚂蚁啃骨头”，高兴极了，他看了走，走了又来看，一连到这个模型旁边看了五次。上海市几个发电厂的修配车间，为了保证钢铁“元帅”升帐、克服电力不足的困难，决定今年联合制造一台一万二千瓩的发电机，但是，没有大型机床加工，职工们很发愁。现在，闸北发电厂和杨树浦发电厂派人来参观后，也找到了解决这个困难的钥匙，这把钥匙就是“蚂蚁啃骨头”。
    对于“土”和“洋”的问题，来自上海的观众体会特别深刻。上海久安染织厂织色布的布机都是进口货，一匹布上面最多只能织四种颜色，但是，展览会上有一部“土”布机，能在一匹布上织六种颜色。久安染织厂的技师翁兆麟，对记者对比了这两种织布机以后说，这部“土”布机使他进一步解放了思想，深深体会到有不少“土”法胜过“洋”法。翁兆麟已把这种“土”布机描绘下来，准备回厂改装他们那里的进口货。
    许多观众在今天参观后受到鼓舞，决心再把原来安排的工作快马加鞭。交通馆里有一首民歌，形容皖北地区实现河网化的英雄事迹说：“过去是灾岗，今年开河网，汽船拖木船，运肥又运粮。乡乡有流水，村村有码头，旱田改水田，年年大丰收。”湖南交通厅地方交通处处长刘春华，看了皖北河网化的模型后，对记者说：湖南实行“一网（水网）、两化（运输船舶化、灌溉自流化）”的条件，本来是比较好的，但是，现在只有洞庭湖滨三个乡实现了“一网、两化”。这次看到皖北人民“把皖北变江南”的英雄干劲，对我们地处江南的湖南，是一个很大的鼓舞。今冬明春湖南全省将基本上实现灌溉自流化，我们准备结合灌溉渠网的建设，在有条件的地区全部实现运输船舶化——做到渠道“环田绕屋”，船舶能撑到田边。陕西鄠县东方红人民公社社长张甲济在展览馆后湖畔，看了水力、沼气、风力小型发电站后说，过去总认为办工业很神秘，现在看来也并不难。回去后，全公社八个生产队至少每队要搞它一个小型水电站。
    就是在今天全国工业交通展览会这个雄伟瑰丽的展览馆里，四年前曾经举办过我们伟大的兄弟之邦——苏联的经济及文化建设成就展览会。那时候，人们满怀希望地说：苏联的今天，就是我们的明天。可是，曾几何时，在中国共产党的英明领导下，由于全国人民鼓足了干劲和苏联兄弟般的援助，四年前在这里播下的技术种子，今天已经开花结果了。那时候在这里参观过苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的天津第二发电厂厂长吴恩起，今天对记者说：“才四年功夫，我们的国家进步多快呵！十五年赶过英国不成问题！”
    傍晚，展览馆锚金塔尖的红星亮了。广场上莲式喷水池里的睡莲，悠悠地闭合了它那绛紫色的花瓣。但是，还有一些观众在广场上舍不得离去。他们也许是在重温今天丰富的记忆！今天，对每一个参观者来说，都是他一生难以忘怀的一天。（9月15日）
