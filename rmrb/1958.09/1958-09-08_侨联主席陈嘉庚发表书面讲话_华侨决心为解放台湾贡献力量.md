Overseas Chinese Federation Chairman Chen Jiageng Issues Written Statement
Overseas Chinese Determined to Contribute to the Liberation of Taiwan

    With boundless excitement, I warmly support the statement made by Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait area. Premier Zhou's statement has not only received warm support from the people across the country but will also receive warm support from over ten million patriotic overseas Chinese.
    Everyone knows that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. Although they were once occupied by Japanese imperialist invaders, they were returned to China after World War II. Since the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, defeated the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and liberated the mainland, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan, relying on his master, American imperialism, to occupy this area. He then allowed the wolf into the house, letting the American imperialist aggressor troops openly occupy these areas. This has been the most infuriating thing for the entire Chinese people in recent years. Originally, our people, especially the people of Fujian, have long hoped for the early liberation of these areas. Our government, in order to strive for peaceful liberation as much as possible, to spare the compatriots on these islands from the disaster of war, and to give the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang a path to self-renewal, but the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is still not awakening. The Chinese government and the Chinese people can no longer tolerate this kind of criminal provocation. We demand that the government take action as soon as possible, must liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and all coastal islands, and must liberate Taiwan and the Penghu Islands.
    The Chinese people liberating their own territory is China's internal affair and does not allow any foreign imperialist interference. If the American imperialist warmongers dare to step forward to interfere and obstruct our country's just action of liberating its own territory, American imperialism will once again follow in the shameful failure of its aggression against Korea at that time. The shameless US Secretary of State Dulles still dares to shamelessly mention the events of the Korean War battlefield. We tell this warmonger Dulles that if you dare to use armed force to interfere in China's internal affairs, you will suffer a more shameful defeat than the defeat on the Korean battlefield. We overseas Chinese will, like the people of the whole country, under the banner of Chairman Mao Zedong, contribute all our strength to the cause of liberating our territory.

    侨联主席陈嘉庚发表书面讲话
　　华侨决心为解放台湾贡献力量
    我以无比兴奋的心情，热烈地拥护国务院周恩来总理对台湾海峡地区局势发表的声明。周总理这个声明，不仅得到了国内全国人民的热烈拥护，也将得到国外千余万爱国华侨的热烈拥护。
    谁都知道，台湾、澎湖列岛自古是中国的领土，虽曾一度被日本帝国主义侵略者霸占，在第二次世界大战结束后，已经归返中国了。自从中国人民在中国共产党领导下，击败卖国贼蒋介石，解放了全国大陆之后，卖国贼蒋介石逃亡到台湾，依靠他的主子美帝国主义占据这个地区，继而引狼入室，让美帝国主义的侵略军公然霸占这些地区。这是全中国人民几年来最愤怒的一件事。本来我国人民，特别是福建人民早就希望这些地区早日解放。我国政府为了尽可能争取和平解放，使这些岛屿的同胞免受到炮火的灾难，让蒋介石匪帮的人员有自新之路，但蒋介石匪帮至今仍不觉悟，中国政府和中国人民已经不能容许这种罪恶的挑衅，我们要求政府尽速采取行动，一定要解放金门、马祖和沿海所有岛屿，一定要解放台湾和澎湖列岛。
    中国人民解放中国自己的领土，是中国的内政，不允许任何外国帝国主义的干涉。美帝国主义战争狂人如果胆敢出面干涉阻挡我国解放自己的领土的正义行动，美帝国主义就一定要再一次步着当时侵略朝鲜的可耻失败。无耻的美国国务卿杜勒斯尚敢厚颜无耻地提起侵略朝鲜战场的事，我们告诉这位战争狂人杜勒斯，你们如果敢于武装干涉中国内政，你们将会遭到比在朝鲜战场上的失败更加可耻的失败。我们华侨将和全国人民一样，在毛泽东主席旗帜下，在解放我们的领土的事业上，贡献一切力量。
