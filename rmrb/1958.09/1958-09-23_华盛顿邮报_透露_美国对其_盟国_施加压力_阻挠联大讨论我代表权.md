Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 21st: According to the "Washington Post," the reason the United Nations General Assembly's General Committee rejected the inclusion of the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations on the agenda of the General Assembly was due to the United States exerting vile pressure on its other "allies."

The newspaper said in an editorial published on the 19th that if the United States "interprets the General Committee's rejection of this agenda as supporting American policy, that would be utter self-deception."

The newspaper said, "The U.S. State Department has recently exerted a vile and unsubtle pressure on various countries, including Commonwealth countries. It has hinted that if they do not support the United States in the dispute between the United States and Communist China, 'political' forces may be compelled to reluctantly reassess American policies on aid and alliances."

The editorial said that these countries "are extremely dissatisfied with this 'do it my way or I won't play' attitude."

    美国对其“盟国”施加压力  阻挠联大讨论我代表权
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：据“华盛顿邮报”透露，联合国大会总务委员会在讨论关于把中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权列入大会议程问题时所以遭到否决，是由于美国向其它的“盟国”施加了丑恶的压力的结果。
    这家报纸在19日发表的社论说，假如美国把总务委员会否决这项议程“解释为赞成美国的政策，那真是十足的自我欺骗。”
    这家报纸说，“美国国务院最近对各个国家、包括英联邦国家在内施加了一种丑恶的而且并不巧妙的压力。它曾经暗示，假如它们在美国和共产党中国的纠纷方面不支持美国，‘政治’势力可能会迫使对美国关于援助和联盟的政策忍痛进行一次重新估价。”
    社论说，这些国家“对这种‘照我的办法办事否则我就不干’的态度感到极为不满。”
