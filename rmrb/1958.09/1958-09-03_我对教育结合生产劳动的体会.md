My Experience with Combining Education and Productive Labor
Zhou Zhihong, Professor of Metallurgy, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

The integration of education and productive labor is a firm and unwavering policy of socialist education. From my experience in practical work at the school, I believe this educational policy is extremely correct and possesses unparalleled superiority.

In the past, our teaching often leaned towards theory. Even with so-called cognitive internships, professional internships, and graduation internships, the connection to reality was only partial, very incomplete, and not very profound. Students did not truly delve into the entire production process during internships, and the knowledge gained was also very unconsolidated. Currently, the policy of combining education with productive labor and the work-study program are the most effective ways to connect theory with practice.

Jiaotong University established the Metallurgy College this year to cultivate the metallurgical industrial technical talents needed for the rapid development of China's metallurgical industry. We firmly implemented the educational policy of combining teaching with productive labor during the construction of the college and have already achieved significant results. Teachers and students alike have realized the unparalleled superiority of this policy. The establishment of the Metallurgy College is based on Jiaotong University's metallography major, with only fifteen teachers, so there were many difficulties. If we followed the regular method, it would take five years to cultivate the first batch of talents, which would not keep up with the current needs of the metallurgical industry. Therefore, the school mobilized 420 students from related majors to transfer into the second and third grades of the Metallurgy College, plus new students this year, totaling 1,200 students. The first difficulty we encountered in building the college was the lack of teachers and equipment. What should we do? How can we quickly cultivate both red and expert construction cadres to meet the needs of the situation? How can we catch up with the advanced teaching level of brother institutions? Under the leadership of the Party, we resolutely implemented the policy of combining education and productive labor. We mobilized all teachers and students, especially the second and third-grade students who transferred to the Metallurgy College, to participate in the construction of the college, using their own hands to establish all experimental factories and laboratories, learning while building, producing while researching. Under the leadership of the Party, students in two second-year classes were the first to go to work. Teachers and some fourth-year students also participated in the labor and built a small open-hearth steel plant in fourteen days on August 4th. It contained a 500-kilogram light furnace, crucible furnaces, etc. After further breaking down superstitions and emancipating minds, more than 400 teachers and students of the Metallurgy College fully invested in the magnificent high tide of teaching, production, and scientific research in mid-August, determined to work hard for a month and a half to achieve results and present a gift to National Day.

In the tense process of starting from scratch and creating something from nothing, there were many arduous struggles, but the students' moods were relaxed and happy. They did not feel that participating in practical production was merely mechanical labor because they truly learned a lot of new knowledge in practical production. In the past, they were laymen in metallurgy, but now they not only learned a lot but also understood many key issues in practical production, thereby mastering the entire relevant metallurgical production process and equipment performance. This way of students engaging in the entire production practice cannot be achieved by any past production internship. It can be said with certainty that students who participate in such productive labor learn more than a professional course and are much better than past course designs. It is worth mentioning that mobilizing students to build laboratories from scratch not only effectively implemented the principle of running schools diligently and thriftily but also, because the experimental equipment was built by the students themselves, they are very familiar with the performance of these devices. They will not be as unfamiliar and afraid to start as they were in the past when doing teaching experiments, but will inevitably be very proficient, thereby greatly improving the level of teaching experiments. Therefore, I believe that earnestly implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor can not only well implement the principle of running schools diligently and thriftily but is also the only good way to cultivate students.

The policy of combining education with productive labor is not only the only good way to cultivate students but also a good way to cultivate and improve teachers. For example, more than a dozen teachers in the Metallurgy College will teach second and third-year students after the summer vacation, and the second and third-year students have already mastered relevant metallurgical knowledge and have considerable practical experience through the above-mentioned productive labor in the school construction process. If teachers lecture from a theoretical perspective, they will not be able to meet the needs of students. Therefore, teachers must also join students in productive labor to be competent for teaching work and teach students well. And there are many topics that universities can combine with practical production to conduct scientific research. Combining teaching, scientific research, and production can mobilize students to participate in scientific research and fully unleash the potential of the student body.

From the current situation, the results of implementing this policy are that teachers and students do feel that they have gained a lot. However, some people still believe that because teachers and students currently lack practical knowledge, they are certain to feel that they have gained something when they first come into contact with practice. However, if this continues for a long time, students may lose interest in specific productive labor because they feel that they have not gained much, so it is doubtful whether this policy can be implemented for a long time. I think this concern is unnecessary. We are currently starting from scratch, from nothing to something. In the future, we will grow from small to large, from low-level to high-level. To this end, we must improve technology and solve key problems in production on the current basis, combining teaching, scientific research, and production well. This will continuously improve the quality of teaching and ensure the cultivation of talents who can master the latest scientific and technological theoretical knowledge and practical experience. In this way, students will personally experience the great significance of this policy in cultivating them into both red and expert laborers and will never feel disgusted.

According to this policy, I think there should be a major revolution in future teaching work. The teaching content should be fundamentally reformed. The knowledge that students have already gained in production practice should be largely reduced in class; the main theoretical issues should be strengthened and enriched. In terms of teaching methods, design and theoretical courses can be considered in the classroom, while courses on production methods, such as metalworking, casting, forging, etc., can be conducted in factories. The entire learning time for students can be arranged in two parts: at school and in the factory.

In summary, I believe that whether from the current point of view or from a long-term perspective, the policy of combining education with productive labor will not only not reduce the quality of teaching, but it can be affirmed that only by effectively implementing this policy can we effectively improve the quality of teaching and promote scientific research, and can we most effectively cultivate working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert!

　　我对教育结合生产劳动的体会
　　上海交通大学冶金学院教授  中国科学院学部委员  周志宏
    教育和生产劳动相结合是社会主义教育坚定不移的方针。从我在学校实际工作中的体会，我认为这个教育方针是极为正确的，它具有无比的优越性。
    过去我们的教学往往偏重于理论，即使有所谓认识实习、专业实习、毕业实习，但联系实际还只是局部的，很不全面和很不深刻的，学生在实习时并没有真正深入到整个生产过程中去，获得的知识也是很不巩固的。目前教育结合生产劳动的方针和勤工俭学就是理论联系实际的最有效办法。
    交通大学在今年新建了冶金学院，以培养我国冶金工业飞跃发展所需要的冶金工业技术人才。我们在建院过程中坚决贯彻了教学结合生产劳动的教育方针，已经收到了显著的成效，师生一致体会到这一方针的无比优越性。冶金学院的建立是以交大的金相专业为基础的，教师只有十五人，困难是很多的。如果照正规办法五年才能培养出第一批人才，那就赶不上目前冶金工业发展的需要。因此，学校发动了相近专业的四百二十位学生转入冶金学院二、三年级，加上今年新生共有一千二百名学生。我们在建院中首先碰到的困难就是缺乏师资和设备。怎么办？如何能够尽快培养出又红又专的建设干部来满足形势需要？如何赶上兄弟院校的先进教学水平？我们在党的领导下坚决执行了教育和生产劳动相结合的方针。发动了全体师生，特别是发动了全体转入冶金学院的二、三年级学生参加建院工作，用自己的双手把所有实验工厂和实验室建立起来，边学习，边建院；边生产，边研究。在党的领导下，二年级二个班的学生首先投入了工作。教师和部分四年级学生也参加一起劳动，以十四天时间在8月4日建成了一个小型露天炼钢厂。这里有五百公斤轻炉、坩锅炉等。在进一步破除迷信、解放思想后，冶金学院四百多位师生在8月中旬又全部投入了波澜壮阔的教学、生产、科研大跃进的热潮，决心苦干一个半月做出成绩向国庆节献礼。
    白手起家，从无到有的紧张劳动过程中，是有很多艰苦斗争的，但同学们的心情是舒畅愉快的，丝毫不感到参加生产实际只是机械的劳动，因为他们确实在生产实际中学到了很多新的知识。过去他们在冶金方面是门外汉，现在不仅学到很多东西，而且懂得了很多生产实际中的关键问题，从而掌握了整个有关冶金的生产过程和设备性能。同学们这种从事整个生产实践的活动方式是过去的任何生产实习所做不到的。可以肯定，学生经过参加这样的生产劳动胜读一门专业课，也比过去的课程设计要优越得多。值得提出的是，发动学生从无到有建设实验室，既有效地贯彻了勤俭办学的方针，同时，由于实验设备都是学生亲手筹建，他们已十分熟悉这些设备的性能，做起教学实验来就不会像过去那样生疏不敢动手，而必然是十分熟练，从而大大提高了教学实验的水平。所以我认为切实贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，既能很好地贯彻了勤俭办学，同时也是培养学生唯一的好办法。
    教育结合劳动生产的方针不仅是培养学生唯一的好办法，而且也是培养提高师资的好办法。如冶金学院现有十多位教师在暑假后开学时要向二、三年级同学上课，而二、三年级同学经过上述建校过程中的生产劳动业已掌握了有关的冶金知识，而且具有相当的实际经验，如果教师从理论出发来讲课就不能适应学生的需要。因此教师也必须和同学一道投入到生产劳动中去，才能胜任教学工作，教好学生。而高等学校可以结合生产实际进行科学研究的题目很多，教学、科学研究、生产三者相结合，可以发动学生参加科学研究工作，把学生队伍的潜力充分发挥出来。
    从目前情况看来，执行这一方针的结果，教师和学生都确实感到收获很大。但还有人认为目前因师生的实际知识比较缺乏，因此刚一接触实际，感到有收获是肯定的，但如果长期这样下去，学生对具体的生产劳动就会由于感到没有多少收获而兴趣不大，因此这一方针是否能长期贯彻就值得怀疑了。我认为这种疑虑是不必要的。我们目前是创始，是从无到有，日后我们还要从小到大，从低级到高级，为此就必须在现在基础上很好使教学、科研、生产结合起来进一步提高技术、解决生产上的关键问题。这样就可以不断提高教学质量，保证培养能掌握最新科学技术的理论知识与实际经验的人才。这样，学生将会切身体会到这一方针在培养他们成为又红又专的劳动者的重大意义，而决不会感到厌弃的。
    根据这个方针，我认为今后的教学工作要来个大革命。教学内容上要进行根本改革，学生在生产实践中已经获得的知识，在课堂上要加以大量删减；主要的理论的问题应该加强与充实。在教学方法上，设计和理论性课程可考虑在课堂上进行，关于生产方法方面的课程，如金属工学、铸造、锻压等可在工厂进行。在学生整个学习时间上可以安排在学校和在工厂两个部分。
    综上所述，我认为无论从目前来看从长远来看，教育与生产劳动结合的方针不仅丝毫不会降低教学质量，而且可以肯定，只有切实贯彻了这一方针，才能有效地提高教学质量和促进科学研究，才能够最有效地培养又红又专的工人阶级知识分子！
