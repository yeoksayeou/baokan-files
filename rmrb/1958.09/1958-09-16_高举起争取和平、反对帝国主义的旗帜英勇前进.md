    The Fifth Congress of the International Union of Students, held in Beijing, closed yesterday. Student representatives and observers from various countries enthusiastically and earnestly discussed various issues such as maintaining peace, opposing imperialism and colonialism, striving for educational reform, safeguarding student rights, and improving learning and living conditions in the plenary sessions and group meetings. The congress unanimously adopted the "Resolution on Student Activities for Maintaining Peace," the "Resolution on the Arab Situation," the "Appeal to the Students of the World," the "General Resolution on Opposing Colonialism," and the "Working Resolution on the IUS's Work to Strive for the Democratization of Education, Improve Students' Living and Learning Conditions, and Safeguard Students' Democratic Rights," etc. The success of this congress marks a further development of the international student movement and a further strengthening of the solidarity of students from various countries. This congress has made new contributions to the cause of world peace and human progress.
    One of the important characteristics of this congress is its clear-cut opposition to imperialism. In the speeches of most representatives and in many resolutions of the congress, the strong desire of students from various countries to oppose imperialism was fully expressed. The "Resolution on Student Activities for Maintaining Peace" clearly pointed out that imperialism is the root cause of war, and therefore, the struggle for peace must be closely linked with the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. This resolution strongly condemned the aggressive and provocative activities of imperialism in various parts of the world and widely supported the struggles of students and people from various countries against imperialism and colonialism. The resolution pointed out that the US imperialist aggression and provocative acts in the Taiwan Straits area are a brazen interference in China's internal affairs. The resolution demanded that the US military immediately withdraw from this area; demanded the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations; demanded that the US and British governments, following the example of the Soviet government, immediately and unconditionally cease all nuclear weapons tests; demanded the cessation of colonial wars aimed at suppressing Cameroon, Kenya and Cyprus, especially the war in Algeria; supported the desire of Korean, Vietnamese and German students and people to strive for peaceful reunification of their motherlands, and demanded that the United States and other foreign troops immediately withdraw from South Korea; supported the Japanese people's struggle against nuclear armaments and the revival of militarism; supported Cambodia's neutral policy of consolidating peaceful coexistence of the country; opposed the planning of new military treaties in the Far East and Latin America, and demanded the abolition of all existing military treaties and bases established abroad; demanded the achievement of a disarmament agreement; opposed the Cold War, and demanded that countries carry out constructive cooperation on the basis of the Five Principles. This resolution called on students all over the world to make the greatest efforts to maintain peace. The "Resolution on the Arab Situation" sternly condemned the US and British imperialist acts of aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and demanded that the US and British aggressor troops immediately withdraw from the Middle East. The "General Resolution on Opposing Colonialism" reaffirmed the IUS's condemnation of colonialism and resolutely supported the struggle of students and people from various countries for national independence and against colonialism. The International Union of Students has raised the clear banner of opposing imperialism, which is an important condition for further and more widely uniting students from various countries to participate in the struggle for peace.
    Through extensive and in-depth discussions, student representatives and observers from various countries have further clarified the direction of the current international student movement. As IUS President Belayeff said, the so-called purely student problems and demands cannot be separated from domestic and international problems; the solution of student problems often depends on the solution of the main problems of our era. Representatives and observers from many countries have used their own experiences in participating in the struggle for national independence and against imperialism and colonialism to illustrate that the international student movement cannot stand aside from domestic and international issues. The speech of the Chinese student delegation emphasized that Chinese students have learned from their own experience that the destiny and future of students are inseparable from the destiny and future of their own nation. The Chinese people have suffered deeply from imperialist aggression and oppression. But Chinese students and the Chinese people have never known what it means to submit. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, they raised the banner of opposition to imperialism and, after a long and heroic struggle, finally completely crushed the rule of US imperialism and its running dogs, and established a country where the people themselves are the masters. Only from that time on did the Chinese people begin to hold their heads high, and only then did Chinese students begin to enjoy a free and happy learning environment and living conditions. Many speeches at the meeting showed that only by throwing themselves into the flames of the struggle for the liberation of the entire nation can students possibly realize their own wishes and ideals on the basis of realizing the wishes and ideals of the entire nation.
    The entire process of the congress fully expressed the noble spirit of friendship, unity and mutual support among students from various countries. Students from various countries firmly supported the national independence movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and students from Asia, Africa and Latin America also supported each other and thanked the International Union of Students for its support of their struggles. The congress unanimously adopted a telegram to the US government protesting against the military provocations carried out by US imperialism in the Taiwan Straits area. In their speeches, students from various countries fully supported our people's struggle to liberate their own territory, and they also enthusiastically participated in the large-scale demonstrations in Beijing against US imperialist military provocations and threats of war in the Taiwan region of our country. The noble spirit of solidarity and mutual support demonstrated by the congress once again proves that the struggles of students and people from various countries for national independence and against imperialism and colonialism are closely related, and that the struggle of students from various countries to strive for their own interests is inseparable from this struggle.
    The success of this congress is inseparable from the current international situation in which "the East wind prevails over the West wind." US imperialism has established hundreds of military bases in many countries, seriously threatening world peace and the peaceful life of the people of these countries; in particular, US and British imperialism have blatantly invaded Lebanon and Jordan, threatening the newly born Republic of Iraq, and US imperialism has recently carried out military provocations and threats of war in the Taiwan region of our country. These facts have educated the people of various countries, and also educated the students of various countries, making them more clearly recognize the true face of imperialism, especially recognizing that US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of all peoples in the world; and making them gradually realize that only by bravely uniting and resolutely opposing imperialism can world peace be safeguarded and students' own problems can be solved. Therefore, opposition to imperialism has become their most urgent demand. At the same time, the success of the congress is also the result of the IUS's consistent active maintenance of peace and opposition to colonialism. The IUS's growing role in the struggle for peace and its consistent support for the struggle of the peoples of various countries against colonialism have united more and more student organizations from various countries around it. The breadth of student organizations participating in this congress, the large number of observers, and the acceptance of student organizations from nine more countries as new members, all illustrate this point. Now, the clear anti-imperialist stance shown by the International Union of Students at this congress will bring better conditions for the further development of the international student movement and the further unity of students from various countries.
    We warmly congratulate the successful conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the International Union of Students, and we firmly believe that the International Union of Students will be able to unite students from various countries, strive to implement the resolutions of the congress, unite with the peace-loving people of various countries, and advance courageously, holding high the banner of striving for peace and opposing imperialism!

### 高举起争取和平、反对帝国主义的旗帜英勇前进

    高举起争取和平、反对帝国主义的旗帜英勇前进
    在北京举行的国际学联第五届代表大会已于昨日闭幕。各国学生代表和观察员们，在大会和小组会上，热烈而认真地讨论了有关维护和平、反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取教育改革、保卫学生权利和改善学习与生活条件等各项问题。大会一致通过了“关于学生维护和平活动的决议”、“关于阿拉伯局势的决议”、“给世界学生的呼吁书”、“关于反对殖民主义的总决议”和“关于国际学联争取教育民主化、改善学生生活和学习条件以及保卫学生民主权利的工作决议”等。这次大会工作的成功，标志着国际学生运动的进一步发展和各国学生团结的进一步加强。这次大会对世界和平和人类进步事业作出了新的贡献。
    这次大会的重要特点之一，是它旗帜鲜明地反对帝国主义。在大多数代表的发言中和大会的许多决议中，都充分表达了各国学生反对帝国主义的强烈愿望。“关于学生维护和平活动的决议”明确地指出，帝国主义是战争的根源，因此，争取和平的斗争必须同反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争紧密地联系起来。这个决议强烈谴责帝国主义在世界各地的侵略和挑衅活动，广泛地支持各国学生和人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。决议指出，美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区的侵略和挑衅行为是对中国人民内政的厚颜无耻的干涉。决议要求美军立即从这个地区撤出去；要求恢复中国在联合国的合法地位；要求美英政府仿效苏联政府立即无条件地停止一切核武器试验；要求停止旨在镇压喀麦隆、怯尼亚和塞浦路斯的殖民战争，特别是在阿尔及利亚的战争；支持朝鲜、越南和德国学生和人民争取和平统一祖国的愿望，要求美国和其他外国军队立即撤出南朝鲜；支持日本人民反对核子军备和复活军国主义的斗争；支持柬埔寨为了巩固国家的和平共处的中立政策；反对在远东和拉丁美洲筹划新的军事条约，要求取消一切现有的军事条约和在国外建立的基地；要求达成裁军协议；反对冷战，要求各国在五项原则的基础上进行建设性的合作。这个决议号召全世界学生尽最大的努力来维护和平。“关于阿拉伯局势的决议”严正地谴责了美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略行为，要求美英侵略军立即从中东地区撤出去。“关于反对殖民主义的总决议”重申国际学联对殖民主义的谴责，坚决支持各国学生和人民争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争。国际学联高举起鲜明的反对帝国主义旗帜，是进一步广泛团结各国学生参加争取和平的斗争的重要条件。
    各国学生代表们和观察员们通过广泛而深入的讨论，进一步明确了当前国际学生运动的方向。正如国际学联主席贝利康所说的，所谓纯粹的学生问题和要求是不能与国内和国际的问题分割开来的；学生问题的解决经常取决于我们时代中的主要问题的解决。许多国家的代表和观察员都用自己亲身参加的争取民族独立和反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争的经验，来说明国际学生运动不能置身于国内和国际的问题之外。中国学生代表团的发言中强调指出，中国学生从自己的亲身经历中体会到，学生的命运和前途同自己民族的命运和前途是不可分割的。中国人民曾经饱受帝国主义的侵略和压迫的痛苦。但是中国学生和中国人民从来不知道屈服为何物，他们在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，高举起反对帝国主义的大旗，经过长期英勇的斗争，终于彻底打垮了美帝国主义及其走狗的统治，建立了由人民自己当家作主的国家。只有从那个时候起，中国人民才开始扬眉吐气，中国学生也才开始得到了自由幸福的学习环境和生活条件。在会上的许多发言表明，各国学生只有投身到争取整个民族解放斗争的烈火中去，才有可能在实现整个民族的愿望和理想的基础上实现学生自己的愿望和理想。
    大会的全部过程，充分地表达了各国学生友好团结、互相支持的崇高精神。各国学生坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲学生也互相支持，并且感谢国际学联对他们的斗争的支持。大会一致通过致电美国政府，抗议美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区进行的军事挑衅。各国学生在发言中完全支持我国人民为解放自己领土而进行的斗争，他们并且热情地参加了北京各界人民反对美帝国主义在我国台湾地区进行军事挑衅和战争威胁的大示威。大会所表现的彼此团结、互相支持的崇高精神，再一次证明各国学生和人民争取民族独立、反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争是休戚相关的，各国学生争取本身利益的斗争和这一斗争是不可分割的。
    这次大会开得很成功，是同当前“东风压倒西风”的国际形势分不开的。美帝国主义在许多国家建立几百个军事基地，严重地威胁着世界和平和这些国家人民的和平生活；特别是美英帝国主义明目张胆地侵入黎巴嫩和约旦，威胁新生的伊拉克共和国，美帝国主义最近又在我国台湾地区进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。这些事实教育了各国人民，也教育了各国学生，使他们更加认清了帝国主义的真面目，特别是认清了美帝国主义是全世界各族人民最凶恶的敌人；使他们逐渐认识到只有勇敢地团结起来坚决反对帝国主义，才能够保卫住世界和平，才能够解决学生自身的问题。因此，反对帝国主义成了他们最迫切的要求。同时，大会的成功也是国际学联一贯积极维护和平、反对殖民主义的结果。国际学联在争取和平斗争中日益增长的作用和一贯支持各国人民反对殖民主义的斗争，已经把越来越多的各国学生组织团结到它的周围。参加这次大会的学生组织之广、观察员之多和又接受了九个国家的学生组织为新会员，正说明了这一点。现在，国际学联在这次大会中所表现出的鲜明的反对帝国主义的立场，将给国际学生运动的进一步发展和各国学生的进一步团结带来更好的条件。
    我们热烈祝贺国际学联第五届代表大会圆满成功，我们深信国际学联一定能够团结各国学生，努力实现大会的决议，同爱好和平的各国人民团结一致，高举争取和平、反对帝国主义的旗帜英勇前进！
