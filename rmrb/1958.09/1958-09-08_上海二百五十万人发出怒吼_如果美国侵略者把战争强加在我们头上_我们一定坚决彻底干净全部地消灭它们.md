Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 7th: Two and a half million people in Shanghai took to the streets today in a massive demonstration, expressing their resolute opposition to the U.S. imperialists' military provocations and threats of war in the Taiwan Strait.

Today in Shanghai, hundreds upon hundreds of mass meetings were held in various districts of the city, as well as in factories, rural areas, government offices, and neighborhoods. The demonstrating workers, farmers, intellectuals, and housewives shouted slogans with high morale, expressing their determination to fight the U.S. imperialist aggressors to the end.

In the afternoon, people poured in from all directions to the People's Square in the city center, holding a city-wide rally to support the statement of our government and to oppose the U.S. imperialist military threats.

At the beginning of the rally, Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke first, saying: War threats cannot scare the powerful Chinese people. The Chinese people have every right to take all appropriate measures at the appropriate time to liberate their own territory, and will never give up until they achieve their goal.

Ke Qingshi said that now the U.S. imperialists are openly threatening to expand the scope of aggression to the coastal islands such as Kinmen and Matsu, which will only further enrage the 600 million Chinese people. In history, all aggressors can only find their graves on Chinese soil. If the American aggressors insist on imposing war on the Chinese people, our people will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate them!

Ke Qingshi said: The people of Shanghai have always stood at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle. The eight million people of Shanghai and its subordinate counties vow to unite closely around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, mobilize all forces, step up production, and make all preparations together with the people of the whole country. He called on the workers of Shanghai to arouse a high degree of production enthusiasm, complete and overfulfill this year's 1.2 million tons of steel and all other production tasks, and strengthen the national strength a thousand-fold to consolidate national defense; he called on the farmers of Shanghai's subordinate counties to rapidly set up people's communes and strive for a greater harvest next year on the basis of this year's bumper harvest; he called on intellectuals to go deep into reality, go deep among the masses, and integrate with the workers and peasants to contribute more to the construction of socialism; he called on the combat troops and militia organizations in the Shanghai area to be highly vigilant, strengthen political and military training, and defend our country's sacred and inviolable territory and sovereignty.

Also speaking at the meeting were Chen Wangdao, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and President of Fudan University; Zhao Zukang, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and Vice Mayor of Shanghai; Huang Baomei, a famous national model worker in the textile industry; Wang Weifu, combat hero of the East China Sea Fleet of the People's Liberation Army who had just returned from sea training; and writer Ba Jin, among others. They expressed their boundless anger at the U.S. imperialists' shameless acts of gathering troops and expanding aggression in the Taiwan Strait region of our country and carrying out war threats. They are determined to contribute their greatest strength to smash the U.S. imperialist aggression and to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands.

Chen Yi, Mayor of Shanghai, spoke at the meeting. He said that the Chinese people have always been a peace-loving nation, and they have always been a nation capable of defeating any foreign aggressors. Today, our 2.5 million people in Shanghai and tens of millions of people across the country are gathering and marching to resolutely support Premier Zhou's statement and strongly oppose the U.S. imperialist interference in our internal affairs in a powerful demonstration. This action shows the strength of our 600 million people, and this strength will surely be able to smash the U.S. imperialist aggression.

Chen Yi said that the tension in the Taiwan Strait region is entirely the responsibility of the U.S. imperialists. Our actions are defensive and just, and truth and justice are on our side. The people of the whole world, including the truly peace-loving people of the United States, support us.

He said that our military self-defense actions on the front lines of national defense are closely linked with the great leap forward in our domestic industrial and agricultural production and construction and the great leap forward in culture, science, and technology. The troops on the front lines protect our great leap forward, and our great leap forward supports, consolidates, and strengthens the national defense forces. Mayor Chen Yi extended cordial greetings to the people of Shanghai, hoping that everyone would go all out and raise the speed of Shanghai's industrial and agricultural construction to a higher level and do a better job. More powerfully support our country's socialist construction and support the troops who are bravely standing on the front lines of national defense to defend the sacred territory of the motherland.

Chen Yi's speech strongly inspired the 250,000 people in the city center square. Finally, he led the audience in shouting slogans, and the roar of anger against American aggression resounded like a landslide and thunder.

After the meeting, the boiling crowds immediately set out in six routes and began a grand demonstration.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 7th: Officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai held a rally overnight on the 6th, warmly supporting Premier Zhou's statement and resolving to repel U.S. imperialist military provocations at any time.

Jiang Daoping, a Second-Class Combat Hero of the Air Force who shot down American planes during the Korean War, angrily stated: If the U.S. imperialists do not withdraw their claws from the Taiwan region, we will completely cut them off.

Naval officers and soldiers held rallies at their respective posts. Sailors of a certain ship who participated in the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island expressed that they would accelerate military training, make all preparations, and accept the order to liberate Taiwan at any time. Wen Yingzeng, company commander of a certain company in the Shanghai Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said: "We will definitely hold our weapons tightly and be ready at any time to give a devastating blow to the American aggressors who invade our territory."

    据新华社上海7日电　上海街头上今天出现了二百五十万人的声势浩大的示威游行队伍，游行的人们表示坚决反对美帝国主义在台湾海峡的军事挑衅和战争威胁。
    今天的上海，成百上千起的群众大会，分别在全市各区和工厂、农村、机关、里弄举行。游行的工人、农民、知识分子、家庭妇女们高呼口号，斗志昂扬，表示坚决要和美帝国主义侵略者斗争到底。
    下午，人们从四面八方涌往市中心的人民广场，举行了全市性的拥护我国政府声明及对美帝国主义军事威胁大会。
    大会开始，中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施首先在会上讲话，他说：战争威胁是吓不倒强大的中国人民的，中国人民完全有权采取一切适当的方法在适当的时候解放自己的领土，不达目的决不罢休。
    柯庆施说，现在美帝国主义竟公开威胁，要把侵略范围扩大到金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，这只能更加激怒中国六亿人民，历史上一切侵略者在中国土地上只能找到他们的坟墓。如果美国侵略者一定要把战争强加在我们中国人民头上，我国人民一定坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭它们！
    柯庆施说：上海人民从来就是站在反帝斗争最前线。上海市及所属各县八百万人民誓和全国人民一道，紧密地团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，动员一切力量，加紧生产，做好一切准备。他号召上海工人要鼓起高度生产热情，完成和超额完成今年一百二十万吨钢和其他一切生产任务，千百倍地加强国家力量，巩固国防；他号召上海市所属各县农民迅速办起人民公社，在今年丰收的基础上，争取明年更大的丰收；他号召知识分子深入实际、深入群众和工农打成一片，为建设社会主义贡献更大的力量；他号召上海地区的战斗部队和民兵组织提高警惕，加强政治和军事训练，保卫我国神圣不可侵犯的领土与主权。

    上海市市长陈毅，在会上讲了话。他说，中国人民历来是一个爱好和平的民族，也历来是能够击败任何外来侵略者的民族。今天我们上海二百五十万人民和全国几千万人集会游行，就是坚决拥护周总理的声明，强烈反对美帝国主义干涉我国内政的强大示威。这种行动显示了我国六亿人民的力量，这个力量一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的侵略。
    陈毅说，台湾海峡地区局势的紧张，完全要由美帝国主义负责。我们的行动是自卫的、正义的，真理和正义都在我们这边。全世界人民，包括美国真正爱好和平的人民都支持我们。
    他说，我们海防前线的军事自卫行动与我们国内工农业生产建设的大跃进、文化科学技术的大跃进紧密结合在一起，前线的部队保卫了我们的大跃进，我们的大跃进就支援巩固和加强了国防力量。陈毅市长向上海人民亲切问好，希望大家鼓足干劲，把上海工农业建设速度提得更高，搞得更好。更有力地支援我国的社会主义建设，支援英勇地站在海防前线捍卫祖国神圣领土的部队。
    陈毅的讲话强烈地激励着市中心广场的二十五万群众。最后，他带领全场高呼口号，会场上反对美国侵略的怒吼声如山崩雷鸣。
    会后，沸腾的人群立即六路出动，开始了盛大的示威游行。

    海军官兵们在各自的岗位上举行集会。参加过解放一江山岛战斗的某舰水兵们表示要加速练兵，做好一切准备，随时接受解放台湾的命令。中国人民解放军上海警戒区某连连长闻英增说：我们一定握紧武器，随时准备给进犯我国领土的美国侵略者以毁灭性的打击。”
