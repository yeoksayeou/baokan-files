    At 3 p.m. on September 9th, the Longjiang Electric Factory in Harbin fired a volley of salutes, announcing the establishment of the factory's militia general corps. The political commissar of the general corps (the factory's Party Secretary) Comrade Liu Haomin is a veteran Red Army soldier who went through the 25,000-li Long March. At the establishment meeting, he announced: "We are all prepared and ready to listen to the call of the motherland, go to the front, and severely strike American imperialism." On this day, they held the gun distribution ceremony for the militia general corps. Early in the morning, these male and female militia members wearing badges and carrying backpacks arrived at the factory heroically. They put their backpacks next to the machines and immediately started production. By the time the work whistle sounded, they had already worked for an hour. Female militia member Wang Shuqin said: "Once the motherland needs me, I will take off my work clothes, put on my military uniform, and go to the front." On the same day, some militia members in this factory who were on the night shift immediately engaged in military training activities after getting off work.

    工厂保卫队
  　郝汾
    9日下午三时，哈尔滨龙江电工厂放了一排礼枪，宣告这个工厂的保卫总队成立。总队政治委员（厂的党委书记）刘浩民同志是经过二万五千里长征的老红军。在成立大会上，他宣布说：“我们一切都准备好了，随时听候祖国的召唤，开赴前线去，狠狠地打击美帝国主义。这一天他们举行了保卫总队的发枪仪式。一清早这些佩着胸章、背着背包的男女保卫队员们，雄赳赳地来到了工厂。他们把被包放在机器旁边马上开工生产。等到上班的汽笛叫响之后，他们已经工作了一个小时。女保卫队员王淑琴说：“一旦祖国需要我就脱下工作服穿上军装走上前线。”当天这个厂有些夜班生产的保卫队员，下班后马上就投入练兵活动。
