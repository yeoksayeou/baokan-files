    The tense situation in the Taiwan Strait is intensifying due to new US acts of aggression.
    On the afternoon of September 7th, US warships escorted transport ships of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, openly sailing into the territorial waters of China's Kinmen and Xiamen areas. This is a serious infringement upon China's sovereignty. The Government of the People's Republic of China has declared that the breadth of China's territorial sea is twelve nautical miles, and Kinmen belongs to China's inland islands. The aggressive US imperialism obviously has illusions about the situation in the past two days, attempting to wantonly carry out new military provocations against the Chinese people. The intrusion of US warships into Chinese territorial waters contains serious dangers. The spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a serious warning about this. The Chinese people, who resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, will not sit idly by in the face of such blatant infringement. The US authorities must bear the serious consequences arising from the intrusion of US warships into Chinese territorial waters.
    In the past few days, the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front, in order to give the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched in the Kinmen area a chance to repent, took the initiative to stop the bombing of the Chiang troops. However, the Chiang troops showed no sign of repentance, and continued to bombard the Xiamen area and nearby villages and towns, killing and wounding more than 30 residents, most of whom were middle school students in class. The Chiang Kai-shek "Ministry of National Defense" is trying to quibble about this brutal crime. Moreover, Taiwan's radio today threatened coastal residents to evacuate, indicating that the Chiang troops will further recklessly bombard peaceful villages and towns. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Chiang troops, who do not know how to repent and are brutal by nature, will not escape the punishment they deserve.
    The US imperialist military provocations are arousing unprecedented patriotic enthusiasm among the Chinese people. Six hundred million people are responding to the call of the Supreme State Conference and are mobilizing to resolutely oppose US imperialist interference in China's internal affairs. The Chinese people's struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and liberate their territory will surely be victorious. The military provocations and war threats of the US aggressors will certainly be completely defeated.

　　台湾海峡地区的紧张局势由于美国的新侵略活动而正在加剧
　　——新华社七日评论——
    美国军舰7日下午护送蒋介石集团的运输舰，公然开到中国金门厦门地区的领海以内。这是对中国主权的严重侵犯。中华人民共和国政府已经宣布，中国领海宽度为十二海里，金门属于中国的内海岛屿。侵略成性的美帝国主义显然对这两天的情况发生错觉，妄图为所欲为地对中国人民进行新的军事挑衅。美国军舰侵入中国领海，包含着严重的危险。中国外交部发言人对此已提出了严重警告。坚决维护国家主权的中国人民对于这种公然的侵犯是不会坐视不管的。美国当局必须承担由于美国军舰侵入中国领海而引起的严重后果。
    这几天来福建前线人民解放军为了给盘踞金门地区的蒋介石部队以悔悟的机会，曾主动停止了对蒋军的轰击。但是蒋军却丝毫不知悔改，依然继续炮轰厦门地区及其附近村镇，打死和打伤居民三十余人，其中大部是正在上课的中学生。对于这种残暴的罪行，蒋介石国防部还力图狡赖。而且，台湾的广播今天还威胁沿海居民撤离，表明蒋军要进一步滥肆炮轰和平村镇。这是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。不知改悔、凶残成性的蒋军逃不脱他们应受的惩罚。
    美帝国主义的军事挑衅正激起全中国人民空前高涨的爱国热情，六亿人民响应最高国务会议的号召，正在动员起来，坚决反对美帝国主义干涉中国内政。中国人民为维护国家主权和解放自己的领土的斗争必将胜利。美国侵略者的军事挑衅和战争威胁，一定遭到彻底的失败。
