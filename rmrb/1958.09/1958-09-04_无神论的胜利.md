The Victory of Atheism
　　Lè Yúshí
    In today's newspaper, there are several reports on breaking superstitions. From these reports, it can be seen that the gods and ghosts, which have held supreme authority in the minds of the masses for thousands of years, no longer hold any authority at all. The truly awakened masses are shaking off all spiritual shackles and striding forward on the socialist road.
    On the road forward, struggles between old and new ideas are naturally unavoidable. The debate over water conservancy construction in Menghai Dam of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan is a typical example. In this debate, there was a wonderful dialogue:
    The conservatives said: "According to the old rules of our nation, nothing can be moved on Dragon Mountain!"
    The progressives said: "We haven't moved it for hundreds of years, what good has it done us? If the ditch is dredged, we'll harvest more grain, and our children and grandchildren will enjoy the benefits."
    The conservatives said: "If we offend the ghosts and gods on Dragon Mountain, who will be responsible for the illnesses and deaths in the village?"
    The progressives said: "In the past hundreds of years of not moving Dragon Mountain, has there been no illness or death in the village? Now, if we get sick, the government has hospitals and doctors, what is there to fear!"
    In the end, the new ideas defeated the old ideas, not only allowing flowing water to irrigate the fields on Dragon Mountain, but also allowing atheistic ideas to penetrate deeply into people's hearts.
    Thirty-one years ago, Chairman Mao said this in "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan": "The Bodhisattvas were set up by the peasants, and at a certain time the peasants will use their own hands to discard these Bodhisattvas, without others prematurely taking their place." Today's reports exactly prove this truth with facts.
    In the past, all gods and ghosts were both respectable and fearful. It was said that if you respected them, they could bring blessings to people; if you did not respect them, they could bring misfortune to people. Respect and fear combined, they gained supreme authority. In the eyes of atheists, worshipping these fundamentally non-existent things is utter superstition. But this superstition has continued to spread for thousands of years. For many years, from ancient atheists to modern scientists, some work has been done to break superstition, but unfortunately the effect has not been significant.
    Now, with the victory of the Chinese revolution, the people have truly become the masters of the country. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people are creating a happy society. Through years of personal experience, the masses have deeply realized that relying on the leadership of the Communist Party and their own labor can create all happiness, so why rely on any gods? Therefore, the masses themselves have taken action, using their own hands to discard the Bodhisattvas who were once awe-inspiring.
    Of course, in the ideological field of the masses, theism has ruled for thousands of years, and now, to completely eliminate the superstition of ghosts and gods on a national scale, we still need to make a relatively long-term effort. We must see this point in order to correctly guide the struggle of atheism against theism. Because China is vast, the fate of ghosts and gods varies from place to place. Some places have completely eliminated the authority of ghosts and gods; in some places, the authority of ghosts and gods has been fundamentally shaken, but there are still residual influences; and in some places, the masses' superstition of ghosts and gods is still very serious, and some people take advantage of this situation to do evil. These facts show that there is still a complex struggle between atheism and theism. However, no matter how complex, with the development of the socialist construction cause, with the popularization of scientific knowledge, the authority of ghosts and gods will surely be completely eliminated. This spiritual shackle that has ruled the people for thousands of years will be completely shattered.

　　无神论的胜利
　　乐于时
    在今天的报纸上，刊载了几篇破除迷信的报道。从这些报道中可以看出：几千年来，在群众脑海中具有无上权威的神仙鬼怪之类已经毫无权威可言了。真正觉醒了的群众正在摆脱一切精神上的枷锁，昂首阔步地在社会主义大道上前进。
    在前进的道路上，自然也免不了新旧思想的斗争。云南西双版纳傣族自治州勐海坝兴修水利的争论，就是一个典型的例子。在这场争论中，有一段精彩的对话：
    守旧的人说：“我们民族的老规矩，龙山上什么也不能动！”
    先进分子说：“我们几百年不动它，它给我们的好处在那里？水沟修通了，粮食收得多，子孙都享福。”
    守旧的人说：“冒犯了龙山上的鬼神，寨子里生病死人，哪个负责？”
    先进分子说：“过去几百年不动龙山，寨子里没有生过病、死过人吗？现在生了病，政府有医院有医生，怕什么！”
    最后，新思想战胜了旧思想，不仅使流动的水灌溉到龙山的田里，而且使无神论的思想深入到人们的心里。
    三十一年前，毛主席在“湖南农民运动考察报告”中曾说过这样的话：“菩萨是农民立起来的，到了一定时期农民会用他们自己的双手丢开这些菩萨，无须旁人过早地代庖丢菩萨。”今天的几篇报道，正好用事实印证了这个真理。
    在过去，一切神仙鬼怪都是可敬而又可畏的。据说，敬它，它可以降福于人，不敬它，它又可降祸于人。敬畏相加，它就获得了无上的权威。在无神论者看来，崇拜这些根本上不存在的东西，这是十足的迷信。但是这种迷信经历了几千年，仍然继续流传。多少年来，从古代的无神论者到近代的科学家，都曾做了一些破除迷信的工作，可惜效果并不显著。
    现在，随着中国革命的胜利，人民真正成了国家的主人。在共产党领导下，中国人民正在创建一个幸福的社会。几年来的切身体验，群众深刻地认识到：依靠共产党的领导和自己的劳动就可以创造一切幸福，何必再依靠什么神仙呢？于是，群众自己行动起来，用自己的双手将那些曾经令人敬畏的菩萨远远地丢开了。
    自然，在群众的思想领域里，有神论曾经统治了几千年，现在要想在全国范围内完全消除对鬼神的迷信，还要作比较长期的努力。我们必须看到这一点，才会正确地指导无神论同有神论的斗争。由于中国幅员广大，鬼神的遭遇也各有不同。有些地方已经完全消灭了鬼神的权威；有些地方鬼神的权威虽已发生了根本动摇，但是还有残余影响；也有的地方群众对鬼神的迷信还很严重，有的人就利用这种情况为非作歹。这些事实说明，无神论和有神论之间还存在着一场复杂的斗争。但是，不管怎样复杂，随着社会主义建设事业的发展，随着科学知识的普及，鬼神的权威一定会完全被消灭。这个统治人民几千年的精神枷锁一定会被彻底粉碎。
