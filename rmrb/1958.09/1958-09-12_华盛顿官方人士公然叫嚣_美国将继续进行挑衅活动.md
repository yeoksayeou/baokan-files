Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 11th - Washington sources: U.S. State Department and military figures continued on the 10th to issue provocative and war-threatening shouts against the People's Republic of China regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait.

State Department spokesman White said this day, in response to reporters' questions, that to his knowledge, the U.S. government has not considered changing its provocative actions of providing escorts for Chiang Kai-shek's ships heading to Jinmen and Mazu.

According to a report by Cecil Brown, a National Broadcasting Company correspondent in Taipei on the 10th, the United States is prepared to cover Chiang Kai-shek's army in an amphibious landing within twenty-four hours, sending Chiang Kai-shek's troops and supplies to the beaches of Jinmen. Brown quoted what he called "absolutely reliable sources" as saying, "The U.S. Navy will disregard the Communist twelve-nautical-mile width - and any other width, sailing directly through the Communist blockade under Communist artillery fire."

U.S. Pacific Command Commander Felt also threatened that the U.S. Seventh Fleet is "constantly stationed" in the waters off Taiwan and will retaliate for "self-defense." Felt is on his way to Bangkok, Thailand, to attend the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" military conference scheduled for September 16, and he will also stay in Taiwan for four days.

    华盛顿官方人士公然叫嚣
    美国将继续进行挑衅活动
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院和军方人物10日继续就台湾海峡局势对中华人民共和国发出挑衅和战争威胁的叫嚷。
    国务院发言人怀特这一天在回答记者的问题时说，据他所知，美国政府没有考虑改变它为蒋介石集团开往金门和马祖的舰只进行护航的挑衅性行动。
    据美国全国广播公司驻台北记者塞西耳·布朗10日报道，美国准备在二十四小时内掩护蒋介石军队进行两栖登陆，把蒋介石集团的军队和供应物资送上金门海滩。布朗援引他称为“绝对可靠人士”的话说，“美国海军将不理睬共产党十二浬的宽度——和任何其他宽度，在中国共产党炮火轰击下直接开去冲破共产党的封锁”。
    美国太平洋地区部队总司令费耳特也恫吓说，美国第七舰队“时刻呆在”台湾海面，并且将为了“自卫”进行反击。费耳特正在前往泰国的曼谷参加定于9月16日举行的“东南亚条约组织”军事会议，他还将在台湾逗留四天。（附图片）
