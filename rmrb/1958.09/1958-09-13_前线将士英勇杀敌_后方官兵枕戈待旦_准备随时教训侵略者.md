Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army's navy, air force, artillery, armored corps, signal corps, and other special forces, are filled with anti-aggression anger that overwhelms mountains and rivers. Frontline soldiers are filled with anger, valiantly killing the enemy. Officers and soldiers in the rear are standing ready, intensifying training, preparing to be reinforcements for the front, and ready to advance to the front at any time.

	As soon as the battle horn sounds
	The enemy will be buried at sea
	The powerful People's Navy, possessing various branches and modern equipment, from the Bohai Bay to Yulin Port, sailors express their feelings to the motherland in unison: As soon as the battle horn sounds, we will bury the enemy at sea. The East Sea Fleet, under the slogan "Turn anger into strength," has intensified combat training. At a sea gathering, combat hero Wang Weifu said: In the past, we defeated the enemy with inferior equipment. Today, we have new equipment, and we guarantee that the enemy will have a way in but no way out. Air force units, in the intervals between patrolling the territorial airspace day and night, held many protest rallies. A certain unit stationed in Zhejiang area, at a rally protesting the intrusion of American air force bandits into our territorial airspace, warned American imperialism, if you don't stop, be careful of being smashed to pieces. The coastal artillery on the Fujian front has continuously and heavily struck at Chiang's bandit troops. During the intervals between battles, artillerymen launched enemy-facing study. They said, let the angry shells blossom with a hundred hits out of a hundred on enemy ships. Naval marine corps and paratrooper units have submitted tens of thousands of letters of determination to their leaders in the past six days, stating: As long as the motherland needs us, we will immediately advance to the front, and fight bravely on the beaches and in the heart of enemy-occupied islands. The crime of American imperialism, disregarding the solemn warnings of our government and repeatedly violating our territorial waters, has aroused the incomparable anger of the sailors. Wang Jiafa, the commander of a torpedo boat unit that sank and damaged two American-made Chiang military ships on August 24, said: The territorial waters of the motherland are ours, and we have the responsibility to punish these pirates. If they dare to provoke us again, we will send them to report to the Dragon King's "Crystal Palace."

	If the enemy doesn't listen to reason
	Talk to them with artillery
	In the air force units, protest rallies have been held day and night for the past six days. Frontline flight personnel are bravely fighting and striking the enemy on one hand, and severely warning the American aggressors not to be moths flying into the fire, and to suffer the consequences. Units stationed in Wuhan, Shenyang, Lanzhou and other regions, while submitting a large number of requests to fight to their commanders, have launched a training upsurge of "getting up early in the morning, not resting at noon, not going out on holidays, and treating night as day," preparing to drive "silver swallows" and "iron eagles" to meet the enemy at any time.

	The battle slogan of the artillery units across the country is: "If the enemy doesn't listen to reason, we will talk to them with artillery." The artillery on the front lines is fighting more and more bravely with anger. On the 8th, in the artillery battle punishing Chiang's bandit troops on Jinmen Island, the artillerymen shouted combat slogans such as "American paper tigers don't even think about stopping us from liberating Jinmen, Mazu and Taiwan!" and opened fire on the enemy. Groups of shells hit Greater and Lesser Jinmen Islands, sending smoke and flames soaring into the sky. The artillery in the rear, in the training to create "all-round artillerymen," has made rapid progress. In a certain unit, in six days, most of the soldiers reached the level of "all-round excellence." They said, as soon as the higher authorities give an order, we will go to support the frontline brother artillery and fiercely strike the invaders.

	If the aggressors don't pull back from the brink
	They will be smashed and bloodied
	"If American imperialism does not pull back from the brink and dares to impose war on us, our powerful 'steel giant horses' will smash them and bloody them and crush them to pieces." This is the vow of the commanders and fighters at a mobilization rally of a certain armored unit. In the anti-aggression anger, they launched military training for "all-round tankers."

    前线将士英勇杀敌　后方官兵枕戈待旦
    准备随时教训侵略者
    新华社12日讯　中国人民解放军海军、空军和炮兵、装甲兵、通讯兵等特种兵，反侵略的怒火气吞山河，前线将士满怀着愤怒英勇杀敌，后方的官兵都枕戈待旦，加紧练兵，准备作前线的援军，随时开赴前线。
    只要战斗号角一响
    就叫敌人葬身海洋
    拥有各个兵种和现代化装备的强大的人民海军部队，从渤海湾到榆林港，水兵们同声向祖国表示：只要战斗号声一响，我们就叫敌人葬身海洋。东海舰队在“把愤怒变成力量”的口号下，加紧了战斗训练。在一次海面集会上，战斗英雄王维福说：过去我们用劣势装备打败了敌人，今天我们有了新式装备，保险叫敌人有来路无去路。海军航空兵部队，在日夜巡逻领海上空的间隙，举行了多次抗议大会，驻浙江地区的某部在抗议美国空军强盗侵入我国领空的大会上，警告美帝国主义，再不住手，当心粉身碎骨。福建前线的海岸炮兵连日来沉重打击了蒋贼军，在战斗间隙炮手们展开敌前学习，他们说，让愤怒的炮弹百发百中地在敌舰上开花。各个海军陆战队和伞兵部队，六天来交给首长的决心书成千上万，决心书上说：只要祖国需要，我们就马上开赴前线，到敌占岛屿的滩头和心脏奋勇作战。美帝国主义不顾我国政府的严正警告，一再侵犯我国领海的罪行，激起了水兵们的无比愤怒。曾在8月24日击沉击伤美制蒋军军舰两艘的鱼雷快艇部队指挥艇艇长王家发说：祖国领海是我们的，我们有责任惩罚这些海盗，如果它胆敢再来挑衅，我们就叫它到龙王的“水晶宫”里去报到。
    敌人不讲理
    就用大炮和它谈
    在空军部队里，六天来，抗议集会昼夜不息。前线的飞行人员一面英勇作战，打击敌人，一面严词警告美国侵略者不要飞蛾玩火，自食苦果。驻武汉、沈阳、兰州等地区部队，把大批请战书送交指挥员的同时，掀起了“早晨早起床，中午不休息，假日不外出，黑夜当白天”的练兵热潮，准备随时驾着“银燕”、“铁鹰”去迎击敌人。
    全国各地的炮兵部队，战斗口号是：“敌人不讲理，我们用大炮和它谈。”前线的炮兵怀着愤怒，愈战愈勇。8日，在惩罚金门岛蒋贼军的炮战中，炮手们高呼：“美国纸老虎休想阻挡我们解放金门、马祖和台湾！”等战斗口号，向敌人开炮，一群群炮弹，把大、小金门岛打得硝烟冲天。后方的炮兵，在创造“全能炮手”的训练中，成绩突飞猛进，某部六天时间，大部分士兵达到“全能全优”的水平。他们说，只要上级一声命令，我们就去支援前线兄弟炮兵，痛击侵略者。
    侵略者如不悬崖勒马
    就把它碰得头破血流
    “如果美帝国主义不悬崖勒马，敢于把战争强加到我们头上，我们威力强大的‘钢铁巨马’就要把它碰得头破血流，碾得稀烂。”这是装甲兵某部誓师大会上指战员的誓言。他们在反侵略的怒火中，展开了“全能坦克手”的军事训练。
