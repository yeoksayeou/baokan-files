Strengthen Communist Education
Correctly Handle Economic Problems
Liaoning and Hebei Achieve Communization, Comprehensive Development of Industrial and Agricultural Production

    This newspaper reports (reporter Gao Fang): Under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the thought of continuous revolution, the fifteen million peasants of Liaoning Province, holding high the red flag of accelerating socialist construction, have recently achieved the rural people's commune throughout the province. At present, in conjunction with the establishment of people's communes, a large-scale communist education movement is being carried out in the rural areas of the province to further consolidate and improve the people's communes in an all-round way.
    According to the central government's instructions on the issue of merging cooperatives and the urgent demands of the masses, Liaoning Province launched a mass movement to merge cooperatives and townships in rural areas throughout the province in April and May this year. After the merger, the number of agricultural cooperatives in the province was reduced from the original 9,600 to 1,392, with an average of 2,100 households per cooperative. Among them, there were nine cooperatives with more than 10,000 households, the largest having 18,000 households. The number of townships was reduced from the original 2,854 to 1,178, basically forming one cooperative per township. On the basis of the cooperative mergers, the major cooperatives have comprehensively developed agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, vigorously developed industry and cultural education, and some cooperatives have merged supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives into agricultural cooperatives. Some cooperatives have implemented the integration of township and cooperative. Simultaneously with the cooperative mergers, the "cutting off of the tails" was generally carried out, that is, the elimination of the remnants of private ownership of the means of production, and the socialization and collectivization of housework labor were promoted, so that the original single agricultural cooperatives were gradually transformed into large-scale, comprehensive people's communes with a high degree of collectivization, and the province basically achieved the people's commune.
    After the large-scale communes were established in the rural areas of the province, they have shown greater superiority in accelerating the development of industrial and agricultural production and various rural undertakings, expanding productive capital construction, accelerating the cultural revolution and technical revolution, and developing public welfare undertakings. For example, in terms of agricultural production, the intensity of summer field management and the frequency of natural disasters in the province this year were unprecedented. Not only was the autumn field universally hoed one or two more times and fertilized two or three more times than in previous years, but it also basically overcame the severe drought and insect pests, creating conditions for a bumper harvest in the autumn fields. After the merger of large cooperatives, the township and cooperative industries in the province have greatly developed. At present, the township and cooperative industries in the province have already established tens of thousands of small factories and mines. In terms of culture, education, health, and public welfare undertakings, there has also been rapid development after the merger of large cooperatives.
    Although the rural areas of Liaoning Province have basically achieved the people's commune, many communes still have some problems that need to be solved. The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed that a large-scale communist education movement should be carried out in the rural areas of the province to further improve the communist consciousness of cadres and peasants and solve the problems existing in practical work.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th: Hebei Province achieved the people's commune in about a month. The original 42,183 agricultural cooperatives have been merged into 951 people's communes. According to statistics, the number of households joining the people's communes accounts for 99.95% of the total number of farm households in the province.
    After joining the people's communes, the vast number of commune members engaged in deep plowing, manure accumulation, mining, iron smelting, and cultural revolution. Xingtai County arranged the task of iron smelting on August 5. In twenty days, the county only built three small earthen furnaces and produced only twenty catties of iron. On August 25, after the county established seven people's communes, 123 earthen iron smelting furnaces were built in four days, and twelve of them had already produced molten iron. The later-stage management of autumn fields, deep plowing, and manure accumulation in the province have all been further pushed to a climax.
    The people's commune movement in Hebei Province has developed very rapidly. The methods adopted by Hebei Province are: discussing at each level, comprehensive planning, in-depth publicity, building the framework first, starting the movement from above and then below, grasping production first and then dealing with business problems, using the mass line, and implementing the class line, so that the development of the people's commune movement is fast and good. At the beginning of the movement, some people believed that carrying out the commune movement before autumn would have a negative impact on production. The local party committees criticized this view. Facts have proved that the people's commune movement launched before autumn not only did not affect production, but promoted production. Conversely, in places where the transformation to a commune was delayed, the failure to meet the demands of the masses in a timely manner was detrimental to production.
    After the realization of rural communization, all parts of the province are taking measures to consolidate and build the people's communes. The Provincial Party Committee has instructed party committees at all levels to further consolidate the people's communes in terms of production, organization, and the correct handling of the commune's autumn harvest distribution and the establishment of a new distribution system.

    加强共产主义教育
    正确处理经济问题
    辽宁河北实现公社化，工农业生产全面发展
    本报讯　记者高方报道：辽宁省一千五百万农民，在党的社会主义建设总路线和不断革命的思想指导下，高举加速社会主义建设的红旗，在最近实现了全省农村人民公社化。目前全省农村结合人民公社的建立正在开展一个规模宏大的共产主义教育运动，进一步全面巩固和提高人民公社。
    辽宁根据中央关于并社问题的指示精神和群众的迫切要求，在今年4、5月间全省农村开展了一次群众性的并社并乡运动，经过合并，全省农业社由原来的九千六百个社并成一千三百九十二个社，平均每个社二千一百户，其中万户以上的社有九个，最大的社一万八千户。乡数则由原来的二千八百五十四个并成一千一百七十八个，基本上形成了一乡一社。在并社的基础上，各大社都全面地发展了农、林、牧、副、渔各种生产，大力举办了工业和文化教育事业，有些社还将供销社、信用社合并到农业社里，一部分社实行了乡社合一。与并社的同时，普遍地进行了“割尾巴”，即消灭生产资料私有制的残余，推行了家务劳动社会化和集体化，从而使原来是单一的农业社逐渐转变为大型的综合性的集体化程度很高的人民公社，使全省基本上实现了人民公社化。
    全省农村并办大公社以后，在加快工农业生产和农村各项事业的发展，扩大生产性的基本建设，加速文化革命和技术革命，发展公共福利事业等方面，都表现了更伟大的优越性。如在农业生产方面，今年全省夏季田间管理的紧张和自然灾害的频繁程度是空前未有的，全省秋田不但普遍比往年多铲趟一两遍和多追肥两三遍，而且基本上战胜了严重的旱灾和虫灾，为秋田大丰收创造了条件。并大社后，全省乡社工业有了很大发展。现在全省乡社工业已经办起了上万处小型厂矿。在文教、卫生、公共福利事业方面，并大社后也都有了飞跃发展。
    目前辽宁省农村虽已基本实现了人民公社化，但不少公社还有若干问题需要加以解决，中共辽宁省委提出：在全省农村要开展一次大规模的共产主义教育运动，以进一步提高干部、农民的共产主义觉悟，并解决实际工作中存在的问题。
    据新华社天津12日电　河北省在一个月左右的时间内实现了人民公社化。原有的四万二千一百八十三个农业社已合并转为九百五十一个人民公社，据统计，加入人民公社的户数占全省农户的99.95％。
    广大社员在加入人民公社以后，就大搞深翻地、积肥、采矿、炼铁和文化革命。邢台县在8月5日布置炼铁任务，二十天全县才建立三个小土炉，只生产了二十斤铁。8月25日全县建成七个人民公社后，四天就建成了土炼铁炉一百二十三座，有十二座已经流出了铁水。全省秋田后期管理、深翻地和积肥等工作，都进一步推向高潮。
    河北省人民公社运动发展十分迅速。河北省采取的办法是：逐级讨论、全面规划，深入宣传、先搭架子，先上动、后下动，先抓生产、后处理经营问题，运用群众路线、贯彻阶级路线，因而作到了人民公社运动的发展又快又好。运动开始时，有些人认为秋前搞公社运动会对生产有不利的影响。各地党委批判了这种看法。事实证明，秋前掀起的人民公社运动，不仅没有影响生产，却推动了生产；相反地，在迟迟没有转公社的地方，由于群众要求不能及时满足，反而对生产不利。
    在实现农村公社化以后，全省各地正采取措施来巩固和建设人民公社。省委已经指示各级党委从生产上、组织上以及在正确处理公社的秋收分配和建立新的分配制度中，进一步巩固人民公社。
