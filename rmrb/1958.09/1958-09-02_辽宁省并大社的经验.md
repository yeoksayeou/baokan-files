　　Liaoning Province's Experience in Merging Large Cooperatives
　　Rural Work Department of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    In accordance with the Central Committee's instructions on the issue of merging cooperatives and the urgent demands of the masses, Liaoning Province carried out a merger of small cooperatives into large cooperatives in May of this year. After the merger, the province's agricultural cooperatives were reduced from the original 9,600 cooperatives to 1,412 large cooperatives, averaging about 2,100 households per cooperative, including nine cooperatives with more than 10,000 households, the largest with 18,000 households. Simultaneously with the merger of large cooperatives, the administrative divisions of the townships were adjusted. The province was reduced from the original 2,854 townships to 1,226 townships, of which 83% were one cooperative per township, basically achieving one cooperative per township.
    The formation of this mass movement to merge cooperatives is due, on the one hand, to the fact that the province had established 399 large cooperatives with more than 1,000 households each since 1956. These large cooperatives were distributed in various cities and counties throughout the province and were well-managed, demonstrating great superiority in production. Cadres and the masses summarized four major benefits of large cooperatives from their own experience: (1) Large cooperatives have great strength (manpower, material resources, and financial resources) and can engage in large-scale production and construction; (2) Large cooperatives can make full use of land, plant according to local conditions, and the contiguous land of large cooperatives also facilitates mechanized farming and unified water use; (3) Large cooperatives can support each other, solve various difficulties, and have more conditions for large-scale collaboration; (4) "Large cooperatives can ward off evil," because large cooperatives have a large poor peasant advantage, strong cadres, and can overwhelm all unhealthy tendencies. On the other hand, after a large-scale upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction was launched in the countryside last winter and this spring, the contradiction that the scale of existing cooperatives could not meet the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production was quickly revealed. Small cooperatives not only made many things impossible to do, but also made people afraid to even think about them, which restricted the development and utilization of natural resources and also restricted the liberation of people's minds. As the masses said, "Small cooperatives have become a stumbling block to the Great Leap Forward." Due to the practical education of the superiority of large cooperatives and the urgent needs of production, the masses showed a strong demand for merging into large cooperatives. Before the leadership proposed merging cooperatives, the masses applied to the leading organs to merge cooperatives; after the leadership proposed merging cooperatives, they immediately took action. Some worked hard in production during the day and gathered in the evening, beating gongs and drums, and holding celebration meetings for merging cooperatives; some small cooperatives jointly built a reservoir, and everyone calculated and merged the cooperatives on the construction site. It showed an unstoppable momentum.
    The movement to merge large cooperatives promoted a high tide of production. As some cooperative cadres said, "Where there is a merger of cooperatives, there is a new high tide of production." After the original thirteen small cooperatives in Gouyan Township, Yingkou County, were merged into one large cooperative, they immediately purchased nine tractors and forty-seven double-wheel double-share plows, expanding the cultivated area by more than 4,000 mu; in addition, they also built five machine irrigation stations and unified the irrigation network, increasing the irrigated area from the original 25,000 mu to 40,000 mu; three small cooperatives in this township were originally very backward, and after the merger, the township Party committee sent two members to serve as branch secretaries to strengthen the work, and in just one month they removed the label of backwardness and planted the red flag. Furao Cooperative of Jianshe Township, Tieling County, was a large cooperative with more than 3,000 households in 1956, but was broken up by the "cold wind" in 1957 and divided into more than ten small cooperatives, resulting in more than 3,000 mu of paddy fields being abandoned. After the merger, not only were the abandoned paddy fields restored, but also more than 6,000 mu were newly opened.
    The movement to merge large cooperatives has also promoted the liberation of people's minds. Some cadres said, "Large cooperatives have great strength and are not afraid of anything, small cooperatives have little strength and can't do anything." Because of this, after the merger of large cooperatives, things that people dared not think or do in the past are now dared to be thought and done. For example, before the merger of cooperatives in Kuandian County, it was only planned to open more than 220,000 mu of paddy fields next year, but after the merger, it increased to 450,000 mu, an increase of one time compared to the original plan. The original Tuanshanzi Cooperative and Donghai Cooperative of the Taiyangsheng Cooperative in Gaiping County had more than 20 hectares of wasteland along the coast that could be reclaimed. In the past, because the cooperatives were small and the strength was limited, no one dared to open it. After the merger, they immediately made a plan to reclaim the wasteland. This year, the cooperative can have 500 hectares of wasteland turned into fertile paddy fields.
    The above is a simple overview of the development of the movement to merge large cooperatives in our province. The following focuses on introducing a few experiences of our province in leading the movement to merge large cooperatives.
    1. Liberate thoughts and break superstitions
    Like anything else, the movement to merge cooperatives also runs through the struggle between two lines and two methods. Before and at the very beginning of the merger movement, there was a debate on the issue of merging or not merging cooperatives. Some cadres advocated merging large cooperatives, while others opposed it. The reasons for opposing the merger of large cooperatives were: agriculture in our province has not yet achieved mechanization and still uses old-fashioned curved plows, so there is no need to merge large cooperatives now; the management of large cooperatives is complex, cadres have no experience, and cannot lead them; small cooperatives are poor and rich, and merging large cooperatives will increase the contradictions between poor and rich cooperatives, affecting the consolidation of cooperatives. In order to unify the understanding of cadres, in addition to organizing cadres to study the central government's instructions on merging cooperatives, various places also focused on summarizing the superiority of existing large cooperatives and the experience of running large cooperatives, and used these vivid facts as teaching materials to educate cadres.
    Facts have proved that under the condition that tractors are not widely used, large cooperatives still have incomparable superiority over small cooperatives. In the absence of mechanization, large cooperatives with many people can still engage in large-scale production and can better utilize existing production potential and labor potential. Taking Taiyangsheng Cooperative in Gaiping County as an example, after merging into a large cooperative with 2,400 households in 1956, due to the full use of the superior conditions of the large cooperative, large-scale basic construction was carried out in accordance with local conditions, and diversified operations were developed. As a result, in the first year of running the large cooperative, the total income of the cooperative increased by 35%, and 93% of the members increased their income. In the great leap forward movement in agriculture, the necessity of running large cooperatives became more obvious. The production of large cooperatives in various places is generally carried out vigorously and leaps forward, while the production of small cooperatives is cold and slow, forming a clear contrast.
    Facts have proved that although the management work of large cooperatives is more complicated than that of small cooperatives, there are also many superior conditions for leading large cooperatives, such as: concentrated backbone strength, which is conducive to exerting collective wisdom; large poor peasant advantage, which can overwhelm all unhealthy tendencies; fewer cooperative units, which is conducive to direct leadership by counties and townships. As long as these superior conditions are used well, the difficulties of complex management can be overcome and large cooperatives can be run well. For example, since 1956, the province has established 399 large cooperatives with more than 1,000 households, which are generally well-managed. Not only have they demonstrated their superiority in production, but they have also cultivated a group of cadres of large cooperatives and accumulated experience in running large cooperatives. It can be seen that only by running large cooperatives can we learn from experience and lessons in actual work and train cadres. The attitude of being afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind cannot create cadres.
    Facts have proved that after the merger of large cooperatives, larger-scale production and construction can be carried out, so that all farmers can become prosperous together. Should we actively lead all farmers to merge and run large cooperatives and develop production on a large scale, or should we passively wait for poor cooperatives to "catch up" before merging cooperatives? Obviously, it should be the former, not the latter. In fact, some large cooperatives that we have already established in 1956 have basically solved this phenomenon of disparity between rich and poor after one or two years of production development. Of course, some large cooperatives may have too much disparity between rich and poor, and rich cooperatives will have to reduce their income a lot in the first year of the merger, and appropriate care can also be given through contracting work and production. Therefore, the merger of large cooperatives does not expand the contradiction between poor and rich cooperatives, but reduces or eliminates this contradiction.
    Facts have educated cadres, and cadres have led the masses. On the basis of liberating thoughts and breaking superstitions, the province quickly launched a high tide of merging large cooperatives.
    2. Strengthen leadership and adhere to conditions
    In the movement to merge cooperatives, we have proposed that one cooperative per township is the most appropriate form in our province. At first glance, this seems to contradict the adherence to the conditions for merging cooperatives, but in fact there is no contradiction. Because one cooperative per township is put forward according to the actual situation in our province and is a concretization of the four conditions for merging cooperatives instructed by the central government. At present, when the scale of production has broken through the village boundaries, it is obviously appropriate to basically control the scale of the cooperative to one cooperative per township. Because this facilitates opening up land boundaries, implementing mechanized farming and unified irrigation, facilitating the organization of production collaboration, carrying out large basic construction, facilitating unified fundraising, and carrying out various construction undertakings to meet the needs of the great leap forward in production. At the same time, judging from the past situation of running cooperatives, one cooperative per township can combine production units and administrative divisions, so that the Party and government leading organs at the township level can more directly and deeply penetrate production, lead production, closely contact the masses, and overcome bureaucracy. However, the most appropriate form is not the only form. In places where the conditions for one cooperative per township are not met, one township with multiple cooperatives is also allowed. Generally speaking, various places throughout the province have adhered to the conditions for merging cooperatives in the movement to merge cooperatives, so the development of the movement is relatively healthy. However, there are also individual places that mistakenly believe that the bigger the better, do not pay attention to adhering to the conditions for merging cooperatives, and blindly pursue "the first in the province." Some counties have already merged cooperatives, and when they see that other places have merged larger than their own regions, they ask to merge again and again, which has caused great difficulties for the management of the cooperative. In addition, a few places have neglected the necessary ideological education work in the movement to merge cooperatives, and the cooperatives were merged with a single order, resulting in the phenomenon of coercion and command. According to these situations, in addition to notifying various places to strengthen the leadership of large cooperatives and properly solve the outstanding problems in the merger of cooperatives, the provincial Party committee also requires the scale of the cooperative to be consciously stabilized temporarily, so as to facilitate faster and better unified planning of production and basic construction.
    3. Handle economic issues with a communist spirit
    When several agricultural cooperatives merge into one large cooperative, the economic foundations of each cooperative are different. Not only are there more or less public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, public property, creditors' rights and debts inside and outside the cooperative, but the standards of share funds paid by the members of each cooperative are also high and low. How should this problem be treated? There are two views among cadres and the masses: one is to educate cadres and the masses with the communist spirit, start from the long-term interests of developing production, recognize those economic differences between cooperatives, and not count old accounts at all; the other is to deal with the economic problems in the merger of cooperatives with egalitarianism, emphasize finding a balance and making up the differences, and emphasize calculating old accounts. In dealing with the economic problems of merging cooperatives, we adhered to the communist spirit, criticized egalitarianism, and stipulated that the public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and public property of small cooperatives should be transferred to the large cooperative, and the debts and creditors' rights of small cooperatives, regardless of the amount, should be recognized by the large cooperative, and the share funds paid by the members should not be leveled out if they are high or low. Facts have proved that this is appropriate. Not only has it reduced disputes in the merger of cooperatives and accelerated the speed of the merger work, but it has also improved the communist consciousness of cadres and members and guided the attention of cadres and the masses to the common interests of developing production. On the contrary, some places are meticulous and emphasize not suffering losses from each other, and those who get more want to find them back, and those who get less want to add to them. As a result, they quarrel for a month or two and cannot merge. However, once the communist spirit is emphasized, the disputes are immediately resolved, and the cooperatives are quickly merged.
    In the process of merging cooperatives, a few places have also experienced bad phenomena such as stealing and dividing public property, privately dividing horse grass and fodder, and randomly cutting down trees. In order to prevent this phenomenon, in addition to strengthening communist education and criticizing localism and capitalist ideology, various places have also stipulated some systems and disciplines and announced them to various small cooperatives for common observance. For example, Baiqi Township in Fengcheng County stipulated five systems and disciplines: (1) The cash and loans of the original small cooperatives are not allowed to be privately divided and used; (2) The articles of assets, food, etc. of the original small cooperatives must not be privately disposed of and destroyed; (3) The original livestock valuation shall not be moved, and shall not be raised. The loose livestock valuation absorbed during the merger must be assessed in accordance with the prices stipulated by the state; (4) All accounts must not be altered; (5) All party members, league members, and cadres are not allowed to engage in fraud. These systems and disciplines have also played a certain restrictive role in protecting public property from infringement and preventing fraud.
    4. Merging cooperatives has promoted production
    In the past, the merger of cooperatives in our province was carried out during the "slack farming" season, but this time it was carried out during the tense production season between spring and summer. Therefore, many cadres are worried: Will the merger of cooperatives affect production? In order to break the cadres' concerns, various places have conducted education on the relationship between merging cooperatives and production to the cadres, explaining that the existing small cooperatives have hindered the development of production, and that merging large cooperatives is to promote the more rapid development of production. Not merging cooperatives will affect production, and the new situation today cannot be viewed with the eyes of the past two years.
    Facts have proved that the merger work in our province has not only not affected the current production, but has greatly promoted the current production. Our main practices are: first, start with production, promote production through the merger of cooperatives, and while planning the merger of cooperatives, start planning the production of large cooperatives and first get the production of large cooperatives up and running. Various places have proposed slogans such as "In order to welcome the merger of cooperatives, production must be done well" and "Take the practical action of doing a good job in production as a gift for the merger of large cooperatives," which has played a great role in improving the revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and the masses and promoting current production. Second, in the use of leadership, in addition to a few people leading the work of merging cooperatives, the rest of the people concentrate their efforts on leading production. Third, the organizational structure of large cooperatives adopts the method of moving from top to bottom, that is, the original small cooperatives jointly elect the management committee of the large cooperative, first building the framework of the large cooperative, the original business scope of each small cooperative remains unchanged, and they are respectively organized into operation areas "production brigades," and the original production teams, except for a few that are too small in scale, can be merged, and generally not changed, so as to prevent disruption and re-formation of teams from affecting production. Fourth, merging cooperatives and handling property are carried out in two steps. First, seize the establishment of leadership institutions and arrange current production, and then gradually deal with the economic problems in the merger of cooperatives, so that the work of merging cooperatives generally does not occupy production time.

　　辽宁省并大社的经验
    中共辽宁省委农村工作部
    根据中央关于并社问题的指示精神和群众的迫切要求，辽宁省在今年5月进行了一次小社并大社的工作。经过合并，全省农业社由原来的九千六百个社并成一千四百十二个大社，平均每个社二千一百户左右，其中万户以上的社九个，最大的社一万八千户。并大社的同时，调整了乡的区划。全省由原来的二千八百五十四个乡合并成一千二百二十六个乡，其中一乡一社的占83％，基本上达到了一乡一社。
    这次群众性的并社运动的形成，一方面是由于全省从1956年起就办了三百九十九个千户以上的大社，这些大社分布在全省的各个市、县，并且都办的不错，在生产上显示了很大的优越性。干部和群众从切身体验中给大社总结了四大好处：（1）社大力量大（人力、物力、财力），能够搞大规模的生产建设；（2）大社能够充分利用土地，作到因地种植，并且大社土地连片，也便于机耕和统一用水；（3）社大能互相支援，解决各方面困难，更有条件进行大协作；（4）“社大能避邪”，因为社大贫农优势大，干部强，能够压倒一切歪风邪气。另一方面是由于去冬今春在农村掀起大规模的农田水利建设高潮之后，很快就显露出现有社的规模不能适应农业生产大跃进需要的矛盾。小社不但使许多事情无力举办，而且使人们连想都不敢想，既限制了自然资源的开发和利用，也限制了人们的思想解放。正如群众所说：“小社已经成为大跃进的绊脚石”。由于大社优越性的实际教育和生产的迫切需要，所以群众对并大社表现了强烈的要求。领导提出并社以前，群众纷纷向领导机关申请并社；领导提出并社以后，便马上行动起来。有的白天加劲生产，晚间集会，敲锣打鼓，开并社庆祝大会；有的几个小社联合修一个水库，大伙一核计在工地上就把社并起来了。表现了一种势如破竹的气势。
    并大社运动促进了生产高潮。正像有的社干部所说的：“哪里并社，哪里就有新的生产高潮。”营口县沟沿乡原来十三个小社合并成一个大社后，立即购进了九台拖拉机、四十七部双轮双铧犁，扩大耕地面积四千多亩；另外还修了五处机器灌溉站，统一规划了灌溉网，使灌溉面积由原来的二万五千亩突增到四万亩；这个乡原来有三个小社很落后，并社后乡党委派去两名委员担任支部书记，加强工作，仅一个月的工夫就摘掉了落后帽子，插上了红旗。铁岭县建设乡富饶社1956年是个三千来户的大社，1957年被“冷风”刮散，分成十多个小社，结果扔了三千多亩水田，并社后不仅把已扔的水田恢复了，还新开了六千多亩。
    并大社运动也促进了人们的思想解放。有的干部讲：“社大力量大，什么也不怕，社小力量小，什么也干不了。”正因为这样，所以并大社以后，过去人们不敢想不敢干的事情现在也敢想敢干了。如宽甸县在并社前，明年只计划开水田二十二万多亩，并社后就增加到四十五万亩，较原来的计划增加一倍。盖平县太阳升社并社前的原团山子社和东海社沿海有二十多公顷荒地可以开垦，过去因为社小力量有限，没人敢开，并社后，立即做出了开垦荒地的计划，今年社能有五百公顷荒地变成肥沃的水田。
    以上就是我省开展并大社运动的简单情况。下面着重介绍一下我省领导并大社运动的几点体会。
    一、解放思想，破除迷信
    像任何事情一样，在并社运动中也贯穿着两条路线和两种方法的斗争。在搞并社运动以前和刚一开始的时候，在并社与不并社的问题上是有争论的，有些干部主张并大社，有些干部反对并大社。反对并大社的理由是：我省农业还没有实现机械化，仍然使用旧式的弯弯犁，现在不需要并大社；大社管理工作复杂，干部没有经验，领导不了；小社有穷有富，并大社会增加穷社和富社的矛盾，影响合作社的巩固。为了统一干部认识，各地除组织干部学习中央并社指示外，还着重总结了现有大社的优越性和办大社的经验，用这些生动的事实作教材来教育干部。
    事实证明：在没有普遍使用拖拉机的条件下，大社比小社仍然有着无比的优越性。在没有机械化的情况下，社大人多仍然可以搞大生产，可以更大地发挥现有的生产潜力和劳动潜力。以盖平县太阳升社为例，1956年并成了一个二千四百户的大社后，由于充分利用了大社的优越条件，因地制宜大搞基本建设，发展多种经营，结果在办大社的头一年，社的总收入就增加了35％，93％的社员都增加了收入。在农业大跃进运动中，办大社的必要性就看的更明显了。各地大社的生产一般都搞的轰轰烈烈，飞跃前进，而小社生产则冷冷清清，慢慢吞吞，形成一个鲜明的对比。
    事实证明：大社的管理工作虽然比小社要复杂一些，可是领导大社也有许多优越条件，譬如：骨干力量集中，便于发挥集体智慧；贫农优势大，能够压倒一切歪风邪气；社的单位少，便于县乡直接领导。只要善于发挥这些优越条件，就能克服管理复杂的困难，把大社办好。如全省从1956年起就办了三百九十九个千户以上的大社，一般都办的很好，不但在生产上显示了它的优越性，而且还培养了一批大社干部，积累了办大社的经验。可见只有办起了大社，才能在实际工作中吸取经验教训，培养锻炼干部，前怕狼后怕虎的态度是不能造就干部的。
    事实证明：并大社后可以进行更大规模的生产建设，使全体农民都共同富裕起来。我们是积极地领导全体农民合并办大社、大规模地发展生产呢？还是消极地等待穷社“赶上去”后再并社呢？显然应当是前者，而不是后者。事实上我们1956年已经办起来的一些大社，经过一两年的生产发展，这种贫富悬殊现象就基本解决了。当然有些大社因为穷富悬殊太大，并社头一年富社要减少收入很多，还可以通过包工包产加以适当的照顾。所以并大社不是扩大了穷社和富社的矛盾，而是缩小或消灭了这个矛盾。
    事实教育了干部，干部又领导了群众。在解放思想、破除迷信的基础上，全省便很快地掀起了一个并大社的高潮。
    二、加强领导，坚持条件
    在并社运动中，我们曾提出一乡一社是我省最适当的形式。乍一看起来这和坚持并社条件有些矛盾，实际上并没有矛盾。因为一乡一社就是根据我省的实际情况提出来的，是中央指示的并社四个条件的具体化。在目前生产规模已经突破村界的情况下，社的规模基本上控制在一乡一社显然是适宜的。因为这样才便于打开地界，实行机耕和统一进行灌溉，便于组织生产协作，搞大的基本建设，便于统一筹措资金，举办各种建设事业，以适应生产大跃进的需要。同时，根据过去办社的情况看，一乡一社才能把生产单位和行政区划结合起来，使乡一级党、政领导机关能更加直接深入生产，领导生产，密切联系群众，克服官僚主义。但是最适当的形式，并不是唯一的形式，在不具备搞一乡一社条件的地方，一乡多社也是可以允许的。一般地说，全省各地在并社运动中，是坚持了并社条件的，因此运动的发展是比较健康的。但是也有个别地方错误地认为越大越好，不注意坚持并社条件，盲目地追求“全省第一”，有些县已经并了社，当见到外地比自己地区并的还大，又要求并，一并再并，结果给社的管理工作造成了很大的困难。还有少数地方在并社运动中，忽视必要的思想教育工作，一声令下就把社并起来了，结果产生了强迫命令的现象。根据这些情况，省委除了通知各地加强对大社的领导，妥善地解决并社中的遗留问题外，对社的规模也要求有意识地暂时稳定下来，以便于更快更好地统一规划生产和进行基本建设。
    三、以共产主义精神处理经济问题
    几个农业社合并成为一个大社，各社的经济基础是不同的，不但各社公积金、公益金、公共财产、社内社外的债权和债务的数量有多有少，就是各社社员缴纳的股份基金的标准也有高有低。怎样对待这个问题呢？在干部和群众中有两种主张：一种是，以共产主义精神教育干部和群众，从发展生产的长远利益出发，承认各社经济上的那些差别，一律不算旧账；另一种是，以平均主义思想处理并社中的经济问题，强调找平补齐，强调算老账。我们在处理并社的经济问题上，坚持了共产主义精神，批判了平均主义思想，规定：小社公积金、公益金、公共财产一律转为大社所有，小社债务和债权不管多少一律由大社承认下来，社员缴纳的股份基金有高有低也不拉平。事实证明这样做是合适的。不但减少了并社中的纠纷，加快了并社工作的速度，而且提高了干部和社员的共产主义觉悟，把干部和群众的注意力引导到发展生产的共同利益上去。相反有些地方斤斤计较，强调互不吃亏，多得要往回找，少的要往里添，结果吵了一两个月也并不起来。可是一强调共产主义精神，纠纷马上就解决了，社也很快地并起来了。
    在并社过程中，少数地方也曾发生过偷分公共财产，私分马草马料和乱砍树木等不良现象。为了防止这种现象发生，各地除了加强共产主义教育，批判本位主义和资本主义思想以外，还规定出一些制度和纪律，向各小社宣布，共同遵守。如凤城县白旗乡就规定了五项制度和纪律：（1）原小社的现金、贷款一律不准私分和动用；（2）原小社的物品资产、粮食等不得私自处理和毁坏；（3）原来牲口作价一律不动，不得抬高，并社时吸收的散畜作价，必须按照国家规定的价格评定；（4）所有账目不得涂改；（5）所有党员、团员、干部不准弄虚作假。这些制度和纪律对保护公共财产不受侵犯和防止弄虚作假也起了一定的约束作用。
    四、并社推动了生产
    过去我省并社都是利用“农闲”季节来搞，而这次却是在春夏之交的生产紧张季节进行的。因此，不少干部都耽心：并社会不会影响生产？为了打破干部顾虑，各地都向干部进行了并社和生产的关系的教育，说明现有小社已经阻碍了生产的发展，并大社就是为了推动生产更加迅速的发展，不并社反而会影响生产，不能用前两年的眼光来看今天的新形势。
    事实证明，我省的并社工作，不但没有影响当前生产，反而大大地推动了当前生产。我们的主要做法是：首先从生产入手，通过并社推动生产，在规划并社的同时，就着手规划大社的生产，先把大社的生产搞起来。各地都曾提出“为了迎接并社，必须搞好生产”“以搞好生产的实际行动，作为并大社的献礼”的口号，这对提高干部和群众的革命干劲，推动当前生产，起了很大的作用。其次，在领导力量的使用上，除少数人领导并社工作外，其余的人集中力量领导生产。第三，对大社的组织机构采取上动下不动的办法，即由原来的小社联合选出大社的管理委员会，把大社的架子首先搭起来，原来各小社的经营范围不动，分别组成作业区“生产大队”，原有的生产队除少数规模过小的可以进行合并外，一般不予变动，以防止打乱重新编队影响生产。第四，并社和财产处理分两步走，先抓紧建立领导机构和安排当前生产，然后再逐步处理并社中的经济问题，这样就使并社工作一般的没有占用生产时间。
