The secrets of the earth

    Red-hot lava cools, producing dark and dense basalt. Basalt is so strong that it can be compared to steel, and can even replace hard alloy tools for cutting metal. But basalt is, after all, not steel. Steel can be freely forged into the things we need, but basalt cannot.
    What if we return the basalt to its pre-solidified state? Isn't flowing lava like molten steel that can be cast?
    This is entirely possible, as long as there is enough heat. Basalt can be melted by heating it to more than a thousand degrees. The temperature required for melting basalt is much lower than that of granite, and the fluidity after melting is also greater, making it easy to cast. This is because it contains less silica and more iron and magnesium. As a raw material for cast stone, silica should not be contained more than 51%. Therefore, not all rocks are suitable for casting. Last year, a unit mistakenly used granite as a raw material for casting, and added a lot of lime to melt it, but it was very brittle after condensation. However, if the raw materials are properly selected and the operation is correct, the rock will become more solid and weather-resistant after casting. It can withstand a pressure of 4,000 kilograms per square centimeter on average, and up to 10,000 kilograms at most; the resistance to fracture can reach 400 to 600 kilograms per square centimeter. Its surface becomes very smooth and dense, like glazed, making it less susceptible to weathering. Its resistance to abrasion is also four to six times greater than that of natural rock. At the same time, it is resistant to acid and alkali corrosion. Someone once placed it in a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid, and after twenty days and nights, it only disappeared by 0.113 mm. It is also non-conductive, and is not afraid of changes in cold and heat, and does not crack when the temperature changes by two or three hundred degrees.
    Since the cast rock has these characteristics, it is used to manufacture utensils needed in the chemical industry, insulators in the electrical industry, and can naturally be used in construction engineering. It is a good material for laying floors and embedding walls. Because of its strong performance, it is also an excellent foundation stone for installing heavy machinery.
    We can also cast it into useful things such as pipes and lampshades... Recently, the news that ceramics replace steel has made people think that cast rock can also be used to replace steel? At present, there are factories in Moscow, Yerevan, and Dalian in China are also producing it, but a wider application requires us to explore.
    Basalt, which is used as a raw material for casting, is abundant in our country. There is also a kind of diabase that is suitable for casting. Diabase has fine grains and a grayish-green color, and often runs through other rocks in strips. There are many in the Western Hills of Beijing.
    Finally, we may as well imagine, today there are still some volcanoes in the world that are flowing with lava. Can we directly use them? Wouldn't this save the process of re-melting? At the same time, we can also consider using other products of volcanoes when using lava, such as using volcanic heat to generate electricity, and using the elements in the gas it emits as chemical raw materials. It is estimated that in a volcanic area in Alaska, 1.25 million tons of hydrochloric acid and 200,000 tons of hydrofluoric acid are emitted every year. What a valuable wealth this is! This day will eventually come, even if volcanoes have such dangerous natural forces, they will become factories serving mankind.

    石头炼成钢，火山变工厂
    石工
    赤热的熔岩冷却了，色暗而致密的玄武岩产生出来。玄武岩是这样的坚强，可以说比得上钢铁，甚至能代替硬质合金刀，用来切削金属。但是玄武岩毕竟还不是钢。钢可以随意锻铸成我们所需要的东西，玄武岩可不能这样。
    要是让玄武岩回到凝结以前的状态呢？那流动着的熔岩不是像钢水一样可以浇铸了吗？
    这完全是可能的，只要有足够的热就行了，大约将玄武岩加热到一千多度便可以熔化了，玄武岩熔融时所需的温度比花岗岩低得多，熔融后的流动性也较大，便于浇铸。这是因为它所含的二氧化矽比较少一些，而含铁、镁这些物质则多一些的原故。作为熔铸岩石的原料，二氧化矽不宜含到51％以上。因此并不是所有的岩石都适于熔铸。前年有某单位误用花岗岩作熔铸的原料，掺了许多石灰才使它熔化，而冷凝后却很脆。但是如果原料选择得当，操作得法，经过熔铸，岩石就会变得更加坚固和不怕风化，平均每平方厘米的面积上能抵抗四千公斤的压力，最多达到一万公斤；抵抗断裂的力量可到每平方厘米四百至六百公斤，它的表面变得很光滑致密，像上了釉一样，更不易风化了，抵抗磨损的能力也较天然岩石增强了四至六倍，同时不怕酸碱浸蚀，有人曾将它放在硫酸和硝酸的混合液中，经过二十昼夜以后，只消失了0.113毫米，它还不导电，不怕冷热的变化，在温度变化达到二、三百度时仍不破裂。
    经过熔铸的岩石既然有这些特性，所以人们用它来制造化学工业中所需的器皿，电气工业中的绝缘器，在建筑工程中自然更可利用了。它是铺设地板、镶嵌墙壁的良好材料。由于它具有坚强的性能，所以它还是安装重型机械的优良的基石。
    我们还可把它浇铸成管子、灯罩……等有用的东西。最近报纸上登载了陶瓷代替钢材的消息，不仅使人想到，经过熔铸的岩石是不是也可以用来代替钢材呢？目前在莫斯科、埃里温这些地方，已有工厂在进行生产，我国大连也有工厂在生产了，但是更广泛的应用，还需要我们去探求。
    作为熔铸的原料的玄武岩，在我国是很多的。还有一种辉绿岩也适于熔铸。辉绿岩粒细带灰绿色，常成一条条地穿插在别的岩石中。北京西山就有不少。
    最后，我们还不妨设想，今天世界上还有些火山正在流出熔岩，是不是可以将它们直接利用呢？这样岂不是省掉了再度熔融的过程吗。同时还可以考虑在利用熔岩的时候，对火山的其他产物也加以利用，譬如用火山的热来发电，用它喷出的气体中的元素作化工原料。据估计，在阿拉斯加一个火山区域内，每年喷出的盐酸达到一百二十五万吨，氢氟酸达到二十万吨，这是多么宝贵的财富！这样一天终会到来的，即使火山有这样危险的自然力，也会成为人类服务的工厂。
