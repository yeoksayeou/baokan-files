    Dedicated to the Ninth National Day
    Worker of Beijing People's Printing Factory, Li Xue'ao

    Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! A burst of urgent knocking at the door – Comrade, please open the door! I am a worker from the People's Printing Factory. We have fought hard for ten days and nights, crushing the peaks of difficulty. The first furnace of white-hot steel has already boiled in our hands! Comrade, please open the door! We want to use the best paper and ink to write this good news. Comrade, please open the door! After dawn, we will carry it through Tiananmen Square! Let the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao review it. What code are we writing into 10.7 million tons!

    The urgent knocking and the urgent voices shattered the stationery store's just-beginning tranquility. The salesperson suddenly climbed out of bed, rubbed open their just-closed eyes, and kindly handed over the paper and ink, with incomparably excited words – "Good comrades, congratulations! On the road to communism, you have crossed another stretch!"

    Two hands clasped tightly in the bright electric light, like a long rainbow! Two hearts throbbed in rising and falling chests, like blowers breathing! Like the sound of footsteps before Tiananmen!
            September 1958

    献给第九个国庆
    北京人民印刷厂工人  李学鳌嘭！嘭！嘭！嘭！嘭！嘭！一阵急切的敲门声——同志，请开门！我是人民印刷厂的工人，我们苦战了十昼夜，踏碎了困难的群峰，第一炉白热的钢水，已在我们手下沸腾！同志，请开门！我们要用最好的纸墨，把这张喜报写成。同志，请开门！天亮后我们还要抬着她走过天安门！请党中央和毛主席检阅，我们正以什么字码写进1070万吨！激切的敲门声，和激切的话声，击碎了文具店刚开始的沉静。售货员猛然从床上爬起，揉开刚閤上的眼睛，亲切地递过纸墨，和无比兴奋的话声——“好同志，祝贺你们！在通往共产主义的路上，又跨过一段路程！”两只手紧紧相握，在明亮的电灯下，像一条长虹！两颗心呯呯跳荡在起伏的胸膛，像鼓风机在呼吸！像天安门前的步声！
