Introducing a Set of "Indigenous" Starch-Making Machines

The relevant departments in Sichuan have designed a set of semi-mechanized operation methods for making starch from fresh sweet potatoes.

The semi-mechanized operation method for making starch from fresh sweet potatoes uses the following machines in sections:

I. Washing sweet potatoes with a sweet potato washing machine

The body of the sweet potato washing machine is cylindrical, with many grids made of wooden strips. At the upper end of the cylinder, not far from the cylinder body, a water pipe with eye holes is installed. When washing the mud, first put the fresh sweet potatoes into the cylinder, and use a hand-cranked (or electric) pulley to rotate the cylinder body. At the same time, turn on the water pipe to sprinkle clean water on the cylinder body to wash away the mud on the sweet potatoes. The size of the sweet potato washing machine can be large or small. A sweet potato washing machine that can wash 25 tons of fresh sweet potatoes a day only requires two people to shake the wooden wheel. Each wash can wash 110 kilograms of sweet potatoes, and the time only takes 5 to 10 minutes. (Figure description: 1. Bearing 2. Support 3. Iron 4. Sweet potato washing machine 5. Shaft 6.

II. Crushing with a powered pulverizer

This pulverizer was created by the Qionglai State-Owned Farm. It is powered by electricity or water, and the machine body is reduced in size, so it can also be pushed by manpower or animal power. A pulverizer driven by a 5-kilowatt electric motor can grind 24,000 catties of fresh sweet potatoes a day, which can replace the labor of 48 people a day. This machine has a simple structure. The machine body is made of wood, and the machine core is equipped with a wooden drum, similar in shape to a road roller, covered with iron sheet, and fine saw teeth are opened on the iron sheet; a wooden arc-shaped finishing board is installed at the lower end of the drum, and one end of the finishing board is connected to a pull rod. Tightening or loosening the pull rod screws can adjust the thickness of the sweet potato slurry. During operation, put fresh sweet potatoes into the inlet, rotate the drum, and the sweet potato slurry will flow out of the outlet continuously.

III. Filtering with a circular sieve slurry filter

The slurry filter consists of a spiral circular sieve, a water tank, a slurry press, and other components. The spiral circular sieve is a cylindrical sieve, with a small head and a large tail. The sieve body is a wooden frame covered with bean curd cloth or bottom sieve cloth and steel wire cloth. The sieve head is equipped with a water and slurry inlet box, and the sieve tail is equipped with a slag outlet box. There is a shaft in the center of the sieve, with a handle inserted at one end and a rotating wheel at the other end. A spiral grid made of thin wood or lead sheet is installed on the sieve inner support. The lower part of the sieve body is placed on the water tank. The clear water in the tank submerges the spiral grid by about five points. The side of the tank is equipped with an outlet with a plugboard for discharging water and slurry. The front of the tank is the slurry press. The outer shell of the slurry press is square on the outside and round on the inside. The shell contains a wooden spiral pressing shaft. The end of the shaft has a wheel disk connected to the transmission wheel of the sieve center shaft. During operation, slowly shake the handle, and the sweet potato slurry is input into the circular sieve, washed in the water tank along the spiral track, and flows into the slag outlet box at the lower end. The box rotates like a bucket car turning water, automatically dumping the slag into the slurry press. Because the transmission wheel drives the pressing shaft of the slurry press to press out the starch water into the slurry water basin, the residual slag is also automatically pressed out.

IV. Drying

In addition to drying in the sun, the residual heat of rice stoves and other various fire stoves can also be used to make drying stoves or drying rooms to dry the starch.

    介绍一套制淀粉的“土”机器
    四川有关部门已为鲜红苕（甘薯）制淀粉设计了一套半机械化的操作方法。
    鲜苕制淀粉的半机械化操作方法是用以下几个机械分段进行的：
    一、用洗苕机洗苕
    洗苕机的机身是圆筒形，筒上有很多棚格，用木条钉成。在圆筒上端，距离筒身不远处，装有一根有眼孔的水管。洗泥时，先将鲜苕装入圆筒内，用手摇（也可以用电动）皮带轮，使筒身旋转，同时打开水管，向筒身洒淋清水，即可将苕面泥土洗去。洗苕机的尺码可大可小，一台日洗二十五吨鲜苕的洗苕机，只需二人摇动木轮，每洗一次即能洗苕一百一十公斤，时间只需五至十分钟。（下图说明：1．轴承2．支柱3．铁4．洗苕机5．轴6．装苕车7．手摇轮8．小皮带轮9．支柱10．皮带11．大皮带轮）二、用动力粉
  碎机粉碎
    这种粉碎机是邛崃国营农场创制的。用电力或水力带动，机身改小，人力、畜力也能推动。五瓩电动机带动的粉碎机，一天能磨二万四千斤鲜苕，可代替四十八个人一天的劳动。这种机器构造简单，机身是木制的，机心安有木质转鼓，形状和压路石磙相似，表面包铁皮，铁皮上开细密的锯齿；鼓下端另装木质弧形捣细板，捣细板一端联接拉杆，松、紧拉杆螺丝就可以调节苕浆粗细。操作时，从进口投入鲜苕，旋动转鼓，苕浆就从出口源源流出。
    三、用圆筛滤浆机过滤
    滤浆机由螺旋圆筛、盛水槽、压浆器等构成。螺旋圆筛是一个圆筒形的筛子，头小尾大，筛身是木质架子，外包豆腐布或箩底布、钢丝布。筛头装进水进浆盒，筛尾装出渣盒，筛中心有轴，一端安插手柄，一端安转动轮，筛内支架上安薄木板或铅皮制成的螺旋格。筛体下部放在盛水槽上。槽内盛清水淹至螺旋格余五分许的地方。槽侧装有插板的出口，供放水、放浆用。槽前为压浆器，压浆器外壳外方内圆，壳内为木质螺旋推压轴，轴端有轮盘与筛心轴的传动轮连接。操作时，徐徐摇动转柄，苕浆输入圆筛随螺旋轨道在水槽内洗涤，至下端流入出渣盒，盒转动犹如筒车翻水，自动把渣倾入压浆器。由于传动轮带动压浆推压轴压出粉水流入浆水盆，余渣也自行压出。
    四、干燥
    除利用日光照晒的办法晒干外，还可以利用饭灶和其他各种火灶的余热，制成烘干灶或烘干房烘干淀粉。  （原载四川日报）
