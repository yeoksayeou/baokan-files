    Henan Province's Work-Study Program Enters a New Stage
    (Our dispatch) Reporter Chen Jian reports: The development of work-study programs has given education in Henan Province a completely new look. Now, the province's work-study program has entered a new stage of closely combining with the Party's current political tasks, central work, scientific research, cultural revolution, and technological revolution.
    Currently, ordinary middle schools throughout the province are vigorously setting up factories and experimental fields, and vigorously engaging in technical innovation. According to statistics from some ordinary middle schools, in just over a month, they have established 438 steelmaking plants, more than 1,400 iron smelting plants, 868 other chemical, electrical, fertilizer, and cement factories, and more than 50,000 mu of experimental fields. Many schools have already begun to undertake state orders. Linxian No. 1 Middle School has promoted its superior varieties from experimental fields to more than 100 agricultural cooperatives. Factories and experimental fields have become the main and best forms for ordinary middle schools in Henan to carry out work-study programs and realize education serving proletarian politics and the combination of education and productive labor.
    These factories and experimental fields are not only the production bases of the schools but also the laboratories for students' learning and the living political classrooms for cultivating their love for socialism. Recently, many schools have moved classroom learning to workshops and experimental fields. When students go to workshops and experimental fields to participate in labor, the teaching assistants also labor with them, and students can ask questions at any time during labor, and the teaching assistants answer them on the spot. This is called "on-site teaching." Some schools have changed review classes and self-study classes to labor classes. Students say: "Labor classes solve problems better than past review classes." Students from several ordinary middle schools in Changge County labor or study in experimental fields and workshops in their free time. Labor has become a habit, and research has become a trend. Now, all ordinary middle schools in Henan Province have arranged labor classes in the main courses, and the attitude towards labor has become the main basis for assessing students' moral character.
    Under the guidance of the Party's education policy, students not only study but also work and farm, which not only cultivates them into all-rounders but also cultivates them into cultured laborers with socialist consciousness. This summer, the academic examination results of ordinary middle schools in Henan Province have improved a lot compared with the same period last year. In Changge's seven middle schools, Zhengzhou No. 7 Middle School, Linxian No. 1 Middle School, Xuchang No. 1 High School and a dozen other middle schools, the number of students who scored five and four points increased by 20% to 40% compared with the same period last year. Linxian No. 1 Middle School has more than 400 mu of experimental fields and has experimented with more than 3,000 varieties of superior varieties. Every student here is a production expert, a small biology expert, and a propagandist for the Party's agricultural technology innovation. The materials from various schools prove that students who do well in labor are necessarily excellent in both character and academics. The students of Changge No. 1 Middle School smelted the first furnace of steel in the county's history. The technical instructor of this furnace of steel was Ma Jingzhong, a 15-year-old boy. He is a special model of the school's work-study program and a "three-good student" who is good at learning, good at character, and good at health. More than 200 work-study models in Xuchang No. 1 High School have the highest academic and moral character scores in the school.
  Henan Province has three basic experiences in carrying out work-study programs:
    First, establish the Party's absolute leadership and launch a two-line ideological struggle. In the first half of this year, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China sent thousands of Party backbone forces to strengthen the political leadership of these schools. When carrying out the two-line struggle, the Party organizations in various schools closely relied on the masses, organized on-site visits, repeatedly carried out airing views and debates, and promptly summarized achievements and experiences, using achievements to refute the opposition and plant the red flag of the proletariat. When Xinxiang No. 1 Senior High School carried out the work-study program, some teachers and students scolded it as "abandoning one's proper occupation." The Party organization led the organization of an airing views and debate meeting on "What kind of people should the school train?" and "What is a proper occupation?" When students proposed to create a set of simple telecommunications equipment suitable for rural use in conjunction with physics research, they were opposed by the opposition, saying that it was "a toad wanting to eat swan meat." The Party organization invited technicians from local factories and united the vast majority of teachers to actively research and support the students' suggestions, and launched an airing views and debate among teachers and students. The Party branch secretary and the teachers and students fought for days and nights and finally succeeded in the experiment. The Party organization immediately summarized the achievements and experiences and conducted a sharp debate struggle with the opposition, and the opposition's arguments were criticized to the point of being riddled with holes.
    Second, schools should be linked to factories and agricultural cooperatives. Almost all secondary schools in Henan have hired technical workers from factories and labor models from agricultural cooperatives as teachers. The schools run cultural night schools for factories and agricultural cooperatives. The school's work-study committee also hires factory Party secretaries and labor models from agricultural cooperatives to participate. Many factories provide schools with simple mechanical equipment and technical force, and agricultural cooperatives also support schools in all aspects. And the students often carry out voluntary labor in factories and agricultural cooperatives. Due to the strong support of factories and agricultural cooperatives, work-study programs have been rapidly developed. In particular, the advanced thinking and excellent qualities of the working class and labor models have a great impact on the students' thinking.
    Third, teachers' participation in physical labor is one of the important keys to carrying out the work-study movement. Now, 98% of the teachers, Party branch secretaries, principals, and students in Henan's secondary schools participate in labor together. At the beginning, the teachers could not let go of their airs, but the students raised various new questions in production labor, requiring the teachers to answer, forcing the teachers to blush in the classroom, which prompted the teachers to participate in production labor. Recently, various schools have rapidly established thousands of factories. One of the important reasons is that the first batch of apprentices sent to the factories were teachers from various schools. When they returned to school, they were the first batch of workers in the workshops.

    是生产基地  是学习实验室  也是活的政治课堂
    把课堂搬到车间和试验田
    河南省勤工俭学活动进入新阶段
    本报讯  记者陈健报道：勤工俭学活动的开展，使河南省的教育面貌焕然一新。现在，全省勤工俭学活动已经走向同当前党的政治任务、中心工作、科学研究，文化革命和技术革命紧紧结合的新阶段。
    目前，全省普通中学大办工厂、试验田，大闹技术革新。据部分普通中学的统计，一个多月来，办了炼钢厂四百三十八个，炼铁厂一千四百多个，其它化工、电工、化肥、水泥等工厂八百六十八个，试验田五万多亩。许多学校已开始承担国家的订货。林县一中在一百多个农业社推广了他们试验田的优良品种。工厂和试验田已经成为河南普通中学开展勤工俭学活动、实现教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育和生产劳动结合的主要形式和最好的形式。
    这些工厂和试验田，是各校的生产基地，也是学生学习的实验室和培养他们热爱社会主义的活的政治课堂。最近，许多学校已把课堂学习搬到车间和试验田。学生到车间和试验田参加劳动的时候，辅导教员也同学生一起劳动，学生在劳动中可以随时提出疑问，教员当场解答，这叫“现场上课”。有些学校把复习课和自修课改为劳动课。学生们说：“劳动课比过去的复习课解决问题。”长葛县几所普通中学的学生们，有空就在试验田和车间里劳动或研究，劳动成了习惯，研究成了风气。现在河南省所有的普通中学，都把劳动课安排在主要课程中，而劳动态度成为考核学生操行成绩的主要根据。
    在党的教育方针的指导下，学生既读书，又做工，又务农，这不仅培养学生成为多面手，而且培养他们成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。今年暑期，河南省普通中学的学科考试成绩，比去年同期提高了很多，勤工俭学搞得比较好的长葛七所中学、郑州七中、林县一中、许昌一高等十几所中学，考试得五分和四分的学生比去年同期增加20％到40％。林县第一中学有四百多亩试验田，试验了三千多种优良品种，这里的学生个个是生产能手，是小生物专家，是党的农业技术革新的宣传员。各校的材料证明：劳动好的学生必然品学兼优。长葛一中的学生们炼出了全县有史以来的第一炉钢水，这炉钢水的技术指导者是十五岁的男生马景中，他是学校勤工俭学的特等模范，是学习好、品行好、身体好的三好学生。许昌一高的二百多名勤工俭学模范，他们的学科成绩和操行成绩都是全校最高的。
  河南省开展勤工俭学活动有三条基本经验：
    首先树立党的绝对领导，展开两条道路的思想斗争。中共河南省委今年上半年曾派出上千名党的骨干力量加强这些学校的政治领导。各校党组织在开展两条道路斗争时，紧紧依靠群众，组织现场参观，反复开展鸣放辩论，并及时总结成绩和经验，用成绩驳倒反对派，插上无产阶级的红旗。新乡第一高级中学在开展勤工俭学活动时，有些教员和学生骂这是“不务正业”。党组织领导开展了“学校要培养什么人？”“什么是正业？”的鸣放辩论会；当学生提出结合物理研究创造一套适合农村用的简易电讯设备时，又遭到反对派的反对，说这是“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”。党组织请来了地方工厂的技术工人，团结了绝大部分教员积极研究，支持学生的建议，并在师生中展开了鸣放辩论。党支部书记和师生一起，战斗了几个日日夜夜，终于试验成功了。党组织马上总结成绩和经验，向反对派进行一场尖锐的辩论斗争，反对派的论点被批驳得体无完肤。
    第二，学校要和工厂、农业社挂钩。河南几乎所有中等学校都聘请了工厂的技术工人和农业社的劳动模范当教员。学校为工厂和农业社开办文化夜校。学校的勤工俭学委员会也聘请工厂党委书记和农业社的劳动模范参加。不少工厂供给学校简单的机械设备和技术力量，农业社也从各方面支援学校。而学生们又经常在工厂和农业社进行义务劳动。由于工厂和农业社的大力支援，勤工俭学活动就迅速开展起来了。特别是工人阶级和劳动模范的先进思想和优秀品质，对学生的思想影响很大。
    第三，教员参加体力劳动是开展勤工俭学运动的重要关键之一。现在河南各中等学校有98％的教员、党支部书记、校长和学生一起参加劳动。开始，教员们放不下架子，但是学生们在生产劳动中提出各种新问题，要求教员解答，逼得教员在课堂上红脸，这就促使教员参加生产劳动。最近，各学校迅速建立了几千个工厂，重要原因之一是第一批派到工厂学徒的是各校的教员，他们回到学校又是车间的首批工人。
