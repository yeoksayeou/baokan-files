	Ashamed or Annoyed?
	The students of the Department of Physics and Chemistry of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel wanted to develop hard alloys. A professor said: "This technology is too complicated, you can't do it." Then he said: "It won't work without cobalt and nickel!" When the students suggested using iron instead of cobalt, he repeatedly shook his head: "Impossible!"
	However, these "ignorant" students just wouldn't listen, and actually succeeded in manufacturing it completely themselves.
	Regarding this "unexpected event," I wonder what this Professor feels today? — Ashamed or annoyed?

    惭愧还是恼怒？
    北京钢铁学院物化系同学要搞硬质合金，一位教授说：“这个技术太复杂，你们搞不了。”继而又说：“没有钴、镍，不行！”当同学提出，用铁代替钴时，他又连连摇头：“不可能！”
    但是，这些“无知”的学生们，偏偏不听话，自己竟完全制造成功了。
    对于这一“意外的事件”，不知今天这位教授先生有何感触？——惭愧还是恼怒？
