Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: The International Commission for Cambodia recently submitted its sixth interim report to the Geneva Conference nations. The report describes the work of the International Commission for Cambodia from January 1, 1957, to December 31, 1957.

The report points out that during this period, the commission continued to supervise the implementation of clauses regarding the prevention of foreign armed forces from undermining Cambodian territorial integrity.

The report indicates that the commission received forty-seven letters from the Royal Government of Cambodia accusing the South Vietnamese authorities and Thailand of violating or threatening Cambodian territorial integrity. The commission investigated one of these incidents. The results of this investigation confirmed that the regular army of South Vietnam had invaded Cambodian territory by two and a half kilometers. These invaders attacked the villages of Ba Thu and Shen Lang in Svay Rieng province, shooting and wounding villagers and looting their property. As the villagers resisted with the support of the Royal Cambodian Army, one invader was killed and seven were captured, including a lieutenant. A large amount of property looted from the Cambodian people was also found on them.

The report points out that the Indian chairman and the Polish commissioner of the commission believe that, according to the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities, the commission is fully qualified to handle such incidents of foreign armed forces violating Cambodian territorial integrity. However, the Canadian commissioner, while also acknowledging that the South Vietnamese regular army had violated Cambodian territory, believed that the commission had no right to handle such cases. The commission voted and rejected the Canadian commissioner's opinion, and submitted a special report to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference (while the Canadian commissioner submitted a "minority report").

The report notes that the Royal Government of Cambodia is in good compliance with the agreement in terms of military and other clauses.

    柬埔寨国际委员会提出报告
    南越侵犯柬埔寨领土完整
    新华社24日讯  柬埔寨国际委员会最近向日内瓦会议各国提出了第六次临时报告。报告叙述了1957年1月1日到1957年12月31日柬埔寨国际委员会的工作情况。
    报告指出，在这个时期内，委员会继续监督了关于防止外国武装力量破坏柬埔寨领土完整问题等条款的实施。
    报告指出，委员会曾经收到柬埔寨王国政府指控南越当局和泰国侵犯或威胁柬埔寨领土完整的信件四十七封。委员会对其中的一次事件作了调查。这次调查的结果证实，南越的正规军曾经侵入柬埔寨领土二公里半。这些入侵者袭击了柴桢省的巴透和沈廊两个村庄，开枪打伤村民并且抢劫他们的财物。由于村民们在柬埔寨王国军队的支援下进行了抵抗，有一名入侵者被击毙，另七名被俘，其中一名是一个中尉。在他们身上还搜出了从柬埔寨人民那里抢劫来的大批财物。
    报告指出：委员会的印度主席和波兰委员认为根据日内瓦会议的最后宣言和停止敌对行动协定，委员会完全有资格受理这一类外国武装力量侵犯柬埔寨领土完整的事件，而加拿大委员虽然也承认南越正规军侵犯了柬埔寨领土，但却认为委员会无权受理这类案件。委员会进行表决的结果，否决了加拿大委员的这种意见，并向日内瓦会议两主席提出了专门报告（加拿大委员则提出了“少数报告”）。
    报告指出，在军事和其他条款方面，柬埔寨王国政府执行协定的情况良好。
