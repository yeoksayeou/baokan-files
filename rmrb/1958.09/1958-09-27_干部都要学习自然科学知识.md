Cadres Must Learn Natural Science Knowledge
Gao Shiqi

Why Learn?

Natural science is a weapon for the struggle for production and a crystallization of construction experience. For the needs of production and construction, our cadres should learn some natural science knowledge, and cadres who lead production and construction must especially learn it. Without a certain amount of natural science knowledge, leading cadres cannot correctly formulate production plans and approve construction schemes; ordinary cadres cannot better implement production and construction tasks, effectively summarize the experience of the masses, and improve the production technology level of workers and peasants. In a word, it will be difficult for us to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically.

Originally, natural science knowledge is needed for anyone, especially living in today's atomic age. The contact between science and life is becoming more and more frequent. No invention of a new machine, no production process of a new substance, is not achieved through natural science knowledge. In nature, mankind has many enemies: enemies of production and enemies of health. If the secret activities of these enemies are not detected early, it will be difficult to resist the disaster when it comes. Obviously, it is difficult to win the battle in the struggle for production and construction if one does not understand natural phenomena and the changes in the surrounding natural environment. Farmers in old China have always had the idea of ​​relying on the heavens for food, and they were full of superstition about diseases and disasters. This is the result of not understanding natural science knowledge. Our old cadres also had few opportunities to learn natural science in the difficult years of revolutionary struggle in the past. Now that we have the conditions, if we do not intensify our research in professional work and work hard to learn natural science knowledge, there is a danger of becoming empty-headed politicians. If this is the case for old cadres, then general cadres need to learn natural science knowledge even more.

What to Learn?

It should be admitted that our cadres are not completely ignorant of natural science. Some comrades have a deep understanding of natural science, and some comrades also learned a little mathematics, physics, and chemistry during their student days. Under such circumstances, they should make up for natural science in combination with their own work on the basis of what they already have. If this is not the case, they must start from scratch.

Cadres who lead factories and mines, in addition to laying a good foundation in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, it is also necessary to study electricity, mechanics, mineralogy, and metallurgy.

Cadres who lead rural work need to learn even more aspects of natural science knowledge. Agricultural science is originally a comprehensive science. In addition to learning general mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, they must also learn a little meteorology, water conservancy, soil science, fertilizer chemistry, and animal husbandry, and so on.

For all cadres, knowledge of natural history and health knowledge are essential.

Our era requires every cadre to have a broad knowledge base. To be broad is to be specialized and in-depth. We must integrate various scientific knowledge for research and understand the connection between this scientific knowledge and that scientific knowledge. I think this requirement should not be too high for revolutionary cadres who are both red and expert!

How to Learn?

Learning is also a kind of battle. To conquer the fortress of natural science, we must have an indomitable will and the determination to fight to the end, and we must understand various strategies and tactics.

First of all, there must be a plan of action. The main thing for cadres to learn natural science is self-study, which requires first formulating a practical and feasible self-study plan. Without a plan, grabbing something here and there, it is impossible to achieve the purpose of learning.

Secondly, we must advance step by step. That is to say, we must proceed in an orderly manner, step by step, and not be impatient. Natural science is systematic knowledge. Do not take the second step when the first step is not clear. On the learning journey, remember not to aim too high and rush for quick results, and do not have the idea of ​​reaching the sky in one step.

Again, we must have the courage to overcome all difficulties. "There is no smooth road in science, only those who are diligent and unafraid of dangers have the hope of climbing the peak of science." We should all remember this famous saying of Marx. It is not without difficulties for cadres to learn natural science. The main difficulties are the problem of time and the lack of guidance and experimentation. Learning to manage time well, squeezing out time, and using spare time are ways to solve the time problem. It is not conducive to acquiring solid knowledge to maintain constant learning, with bursts of effort followed by long periods of neglect. The language of every natural science is not easy to understand for beginners. If you can meet it often, you can turn strangers into familiar friends.

One way to solve the guidance problem is to not be ashamed to ask, take the masses as teachers, ask experienced people for advice, consult reference books, consult newspapers and magazines, and, especially important, consult Marxist-Leninist theory. One of the characteristics of Marxist-Leninist theory is to connect with reality, and connecting with reality is also the best way to overcome difficulties. Mathematics was originally a boring and tasteless science, but if you can learn it in connection with practical things in daily life, it will become very interesting.

Every scientific theory needs to be confirmed by experiments. Therefore, experimentation is also necessary for cadres to learn natural science. The best way is to plant experimental fields (or run experimental factories, if conditions permit). By planting experimental fields, conducting typical investigations, and summarizing experience, one can learn a lot of practical scientific knowledge. Applying the knowledge in books to the experimental field, and then bringing the problems encountered in practice back to study the knowledge in books, the knowledge gained through practice will be more solid.

With a lofty learning purpose, with well-chosen learning content, and with good learning methods, our cadres will surely be able to achieve continuous victories in the struggle to learn natural science.

### 干部都要学习自然科学知识

    干部都要学习自然科学知识
    高士其
    为什么学？
    自然科学，是生产斗争的武器，是建设经验的结晶。为了生产建设的需要，我们的干部都应该学习一点自然科学知识，领导生产建设的干部尤其必须学习。如果没有一定的自然科学知识，领导干部就不能正确的制订生产计划和批准建设方案；一般干部就不能很好地执行生产建设的任务，有效地总结群众的经验，提高工人和农民的生产技术水平。一句话，我们就很难多快好省地建设社会主义。
    本来自然科学知识对于任何人都是需要的，尤其是生活在原子能时代的今天，科学和生活的接触越来越加频繁，没有一种新机器的发明创造，没有一种新物质的生产过程，不是通过自然科学知识而达到的。在自然界里，人类有不少的敌人：生产的敌人和健康的敌人。对于这些敌人的秘密活动，如果不及早觉察，灾祸之来，将难以抵抗。显然的，对于自然现象的不认识，对于周围自然环境的变化不了解，在生产建设的斗争中，是很难打胜仗的。我国旧时代的农民一向有靠天吃饭的思想，对于疾病和灾难充满了迷信，这就是不懂得自然科学知识的结果。我们的老干部，在过去革命斗争的艰难岁月里，也很少有机会学习自然科学。现在有条件了，如不加紧钻研业务，努力学习自然科学知识，就有当空头政治家的危险。老干部如此，一般的干部更需要学习自然科学知识。
    学些什么？
    应当承认，我们的干部对于自然科学并不是一无所知的。有些同志对于自然科学的造诣还很深，有些同志在他们的学生时代也曾学过一点数、理、化。在这样的情形之下，他们应当在自己已有的基础上结合自己的业务补习自然科学。如果不是这样的话，就必须从头学起。
    领导厂矿工作的干部，除了要打好数、理、化的基础以外，对于电学、机械学、矿物学和冶金学的学习也是必要的。
    领导农村工作的干部，需要学习的自然科学知识更是多方面的。农业科学本来是一门综合性的科学，除了要学习一般的数、理、化和生物学以外，还必须学习一点气象学、水利学、土壤学、肥料化学和畜牧学，等等。
    对于所有的干部来说，自然发展史的知识和卫生知识都是必须学习的。
    我们的时代，要求每一个干部都有广博的知识基础，要广博才能专深，要把各种科学知识综合起来研究，并且要懂得这门科学知识和那门科学知识之间的联系。我想，对于又红又专的革命干部来说，这种要求应该不是过高的吧！
    怎样学习？
    学习也是一种战斗，要攻克自然科学的堡垒，就必须有不屈不挠的意志和奋斗到底的决心，就必须懂得各种战略和战术。
    首先，要有作战的计划。干部学习自然科学主要的是自学，这就要先订好切实可行的自学计划，如果没有计划，东抓一把，西打一耙，是不可能达到学习的目的的。
    其次，要步步为营。这就是说，要按部就班，循序渐进，不能急躁。自然科学是有系统的学问，第一步没有搞清楚的时候，不要去跨第二步。在学习的征途中，要记得不要好高骛远，急于求成，不能有一步登天的思想。
    再次，要有勇气去克服一切困难。“在科学上是没有平坦的大路可走的，只有那不辞劳苦，不畏险阻的人，才有希望攀登科学的顶峰。”我们都应该记住马克思这句名言。干部学习自然科学也不是没有困难的，主要的困难就是时间问题和缺乏指导与实验。要学会善于安排时间，挤出时间和利用业余时间是解决时间问题的办法之一。要保持经常不断的学习，一曝十寒，对于取得牢固的知识是不利的。每一门自然科学的语言对于初学的人都是不易懂的，如果能经常和它见面，就能由陌生的路人变成熟悉的朋友了。
    解决指导问题的一种办法，就是要不耻下问，以群众为师，向有经验的人请教，向参考书请教，向报章杂志请教，尤其重要的是要向马克思列宁主义理论请教。马克思列宁主义理论的特点之一，就是联系实际，联系实际也是克服困难的最好办法。数学本来是一门枯燥无味的科学，如果能把它和日常生活中的实际事物联系起来学习，也就会变得津津有味了。
    每一种科学理论都需要依靠实验来证实，因此，实验对于干部学习自然科学来说也是必要的。最好的办法就是种试验田（或办实验工厂，如果有条件的话）。种了试验田，做了典型调查，总结了经验，就可以学得许多实际科学知识。把书本上的知识拿到试验田里去应用，再把实践中所碰到的问题带回去钻研书本上的知识，这样通过实践得来的知识就会更牢固。
    有了崇高的学习目的，有了选择好的学习内容，又有了良好的学习方法，我们的干部在学习自然科学的斗争中，一定能取得不断的胜利。
