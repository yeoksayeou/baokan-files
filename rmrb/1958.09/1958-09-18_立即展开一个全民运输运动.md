    Immediately Launch a Nationwide Transportation Campaign

    A very pressing problem is before us: transportation is extremely strained in various locations. Railways, highways, waterways, aviation, and other transportation departments are all backlogged with large quantities of materials that cannot be delivered to their destinations in a timely manner. Among these are many minerals, coke, coal, and smelting equipment urgently needed for steel production. If resolute measures are not taken to quickly reverse this situation, it will not only affect the general commodity allocation plan but will also seriously affect this year's leap forward plan, especially the plan to double steel production. In fact, production in some areas has already been hindered and slowed down due to poor transportation.

    Why has this tense transportation situation emerged? This is not accidental. The high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production is bound to put enormous pressure on the transportation sector. As production increases many times over, the transportation of raw materials and products will also increase many times over. Therefore, unprecedented transportation strain is an inevitable phenomenon. We say that transportation is a precursor, meaning that under the situation of great production development, the transportation industry must strive to move faster and do everything possible to accelerate its own speed in the face of tense and heavy transportation demands to ensure the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The problem now is that under this tense situation, we must immediately mobilize and find every possible way to ensure the completion of transportation tasks.

    Ensuring the transportation tasks of key production and construction departments, especially the needs of steel production, is the primary task of current transportation work. The task of 10.7 million tons of steel proposed by the Party Central Committee is the most important of priorities. To produce so much steel requires more pig iron, and the production of pig iron requires far more ore and coal for smelting. In the steel production process, transportation is a critical link. If transportation cannot keep up, blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces will have to stop work and wait for materials. The goal of 10.7 million tons of steel is in danger of failing. Therefore, ensuring the needs of steel production is the overriding central task of the transportation department.

    The situation is urgent, but not unchangeable. Here, the human factor plays a decisive role. There can be several attitudes towards the current tense transportation situation: One is to retreat in the face of the tense situation, for example, by sending telegrams to the shipping stations and ports, saying, "We are blocked here, materials are piled up like mountains. Do not send any more trains! Do not send any more ships!" Some units are now adopting this attitude. This attitude is obviously a discouraging one. If no trains or ships come, the materials accumulated at the stations and docks can certainly be evacuated in a "leisurely" manner, but what about the factories stopping work and waiting for materials? The transportation department does not guarantee the speed of socialist construction, does not vow to be a pioneer for the production of 10.7 million tons of steel, but instead allows transportation to limit the great leap forward. This is not the attitude of a revolutionary at all. Another attitude is to wait for the production of a large number of locomotives, vehicles, automobiles, and ships before ensuring the completion of transportation tasks. This seems to be a long-term solution. However, distant water cannot quench the present thirst. No genius magician can "conjure" a large number of transportation tools in a short period of time. This method is of course impractical. There is another attitude, another method, which is to fully mobilize the masses and immediately launch a nationwide transportation campaign. This is the only correct attitude and the only correct method.

    Mobilizing the masses has always been the fundamental way for Chinese Communists to solve difficulties. In the past few decades, our Party has encountered countless hardships and difficulties, all of which have been solved by relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses. Everyone still remembers that in 1941 and 1942, due to the barbaric attacks of the Japanese invaders and the encirclement and blockade by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region encountered severe financial and economic difficulties. Comrade Mao Zedong described the difficulties at the time in his article "Economic and Financial Problems During the Anti-Japanese Period": "We were once reduced to almost having no clothes to wear, no oil to eat, no paper, no vegetables, the soldiers had no shoes and socks, and the staff had no quilts in winter." How was this difficulty solved? It was solved by mobilizing the masses. The policy at the time was: "Organize the masses, mobilize all the strength of the people, all the strength of the troops, organs, and schools, all the full and semi-labor force of men, women, old and young, mobilize and organize them without exception as long as it is possible, and become a large army of labor." The current transportation difficulties are insignificant compared to the difficulties encountered in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region at that time. As long as we mobilize the masses, mobilize and organize all the forces that can be mobilized without exception, and become a large army of transportation, it will not be difficult to solve the difficulties of transportation strain and the congestion of stations and docks. The experience of Changzhou in mobilizing 40,000 people to participate in transportation and the Jinzhou Railway Bureau in mobilizing the masses has set an example for us. All towns, large and small, stations, and docks should learn from the example of Changzhou and Jinzhou, mobilize the masses, push carts if they have carts, row boats if they have boats, carry shoulder poles if they have shoulder poles, carry baskets if they have baskets, first evacuate the materials accumulated at the stations and docks, and be ready to be called upon at any time.

    In addition to mobilizing all the manpower that can be mobilized, we must also mobilize all the means of transportation that can be mobilized, especially the extremely large number of private means of transportation. It should be pointed out that the self-owned freight trucks of government agencies and enterprises are a considerable force. At present, there are 47,000 self-owned freight trucks of government agencies and enterprises in the country, which is more than the total number of freight trucks owned by transportation enterprises. The utilization rate of these self-owned freight trucks of government agencies and enterprises is generally very low, and the utilization rate in many places is only 50%. Organizing this part of the force and unifying dispatch can solve a big problem. This work has not been done in many places yet. Only 8,000 self-owned freight trucks of government agencies and enterprises have been organized and uniformly dispatched nationwide, which is only 20% of the total, and there is still great potential. All government agencies, enterprises, and schools must unconditionally obey the unified dispatch of the local Party committee. In addition to freight trucks, passenger buses should also participate in freight transportation in addition to passenger transportation. If necessary, cars should also be mobilized to participate in freight transportation. Only by resolutely adopting these measures can the tense transportation situation be reversed.

    In addition to mobilizing the masses and mobilizing all the manpower and means of transportation that can be mobilized, the transportation departments must also fully explore their own internal potential, accelerate the turnover of vehicles and ships, and use indigenous methods to increase throughput capacity. There is much that can be done in these areas. In particular, strengthening cooperation inside and outside the enterprise can quickly increase transportation capacity. In order to tap the internal potential of the transportation department, all transportation enterprises should learn from the leadership experience of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau.

    In order to launch a nationwide transportation campaign, it is necessary for various localities to establish transportation headquarters or offices under the unified leadership of the Party committee, with the Party committee secretary taking the lead, doing a good job in political mobilization, and swiftly and resolutely mobilizing all the manpower and various means of transportation that can be mobilized to complete the urgent tasks on the transportation front.

    We believe that as long as the nationwide transportation campaign is organized, the tense transportation situation will surely be quickly changed.

### 立即展开一个全民运输运动

    立即展开一个全民运输运动
    一个十分迫切的问题摆在我们的面前：各地交通运输极度紧张，铁路、公路、水路、航空等各个运输部门，都积压了大量的物资，不能及时运抵目的地。其中有许多是钢铁生产所急需的矿石、焦炭、煤炭和冶炼器材。如果不采取坚决的措施，迅速扭转这种局面，那么，不仅仅会影响到一般的商品调拨计划，而且势必会严重影响到今年的跃进计划特别是钢铁生产翻一番的计划的实现。实际上某些地方已经由于运输不畅，妨碍了生产，延缓了速度。
    为什么会出现这种运输紧张的局面呢？这也并不偶然。工农业生产高速度地发展，一定会给运输部门带来巨大的压力。生产成倍地增加，原材料、产品的运输也一定会成倍地增加。因而运输空前紧张也是一种必然的现象。我们说运输是先行，也就是说运输业在生产大发展的形势下，必须力争走得快一些，必须在紧张的繁重的运输情况下，千方百计地加快自己的速度，保证工农业生产的大跃进。现在的问题是，在这种紧张的形势下，我们必须立即动员起来，想尽一切办法保证运输任务的完成。
    保证那些重点的生产和建设部门的运输任务，特别是钢铁生产的需要，是当前运输工作的首要任务。党中央提出的一千零七十万吨钢的任务，是重点中的重点。要生产这样多的钢，就需要更多的生铁，而生铁的生产又需要比它多得多的矿石和煤炭来冶炼。在钢铁的生产过程中，运输是一个极其重要的环节。如果运输跟不上去，高炉、平炉就要停工待料。一千零七十万吨钢就有落空的危险，因此保证钢铁生产的需要，是运输部门压倒一切的中心任务。
    情况是紧迫的，然而并不是不可改变的。在这里人的因素起着决定性的作用。可以有几种态度来对待目前运输的紧张情况：一种是在紧张的形势下退却，例如给发货站、发货港拍电报，“我们这里堵塞了，物资积压如山。不要来车！不要来船！”现在有些单位就采用这样的态度。这种态度显然是促退的态度。果真不来车，果真不来船，车站和码头积存的物资固然可以“从容不迫”地疏散开去，但工厂停工待料又怎么办呢？运输部门不保证社会主义建设的速度，不誓为生产一千零七十万吨钢做开路先锋，反让运输限制大跃进，这完全不是革命者的态度。还有一种态度是等待生产大量的机车、车辆、汽车、轮船然后再保证运输任务的完成。这似乎是长治久安之计。然而，远水救不了近火，任何天才的魔术家也不能在短期内“变”出大量的运输工具来。这种办法当然是不切实际的。还有一种态度、一种办法，这就是充分发动群众，立即掀起一个全民运输运动，这才是唯一正确的态度，唯一正确的办法。
    发动群众，这是中国共产党人历来解决困难的根本的办法。在过去几十年中，我们党不知遇到多少艰苦困难，都是依靠群众，发动群众，一一迎刃而解。大家都还记得，1941年和1942年，由于日寇的野蛮进攻和国民党反动派的包围封锁，陕甘宁边区曾经遇到严重的财政困难和经济困难。毛泽东同志在“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”一文中描写当时的困难说：“我们曾经弄到几乎没有衣穿，没有油吃，没有纸，没有菜，战士没有鞋袜，工作人员在冬天没有被盖”。这个困难怎么解决的呢？是用发动群众的办法解决的。当时的方针是：“把群众组织起来，把一切老百姓的力量、一切部队机关学校的力量、一切男女老少的全劳动力半劳动力，只要是可能的，就毫无例外地动员起来，组织起来，成为一支劳动大军”。现在运输紧张的困难同当年陕甘宁边区遇到的困难比较起来，可以说是不足道的。只要我们发动群众，把一切能够动员的力量毫无例外地动员起来，组织起来，成为一支运输大军，就不难解决运输紧张，车站和码头堵塞的困难。常州市动员四万群众参加运输和锦州铁路管理局发动群众的经验已经为我们做出了榜样。一切大小城镇、车站、码头，都应该学习常州和锦州的榜样，把群众发动起来，有车推车，有船撑船，有扁担拿扁担，有背兜拿背兜，先把车站和码头积存的物资疏散，并且随时听候调用。
    除了动员一切能够动员的人力之外，还要动员一切能够动员的运输工具，特别是数量极大的民间运输工具。需要指出的是，机关企业自用货运汽车是一支可观的力量。目前全国有四万七千辆机关企业自用货运汽车，比运输企业所拥有的货运汽车总数还多。这些机关企业自用货运汽车的利用率一般都很低，许多地方的利用率只达到50％。把这部分力量组织起来，统一调度，可以解决很大的问题。现在这个工作许多地方还没有做，全国已经组织起来统一调度的机关企业自用货运汽车还只八千辆，即不过总数的20％，还有很大的潜力。一切机关、企业、学校都要无条件地服从当地党委统一调用。除了货运汽车之外，客运公共汽车也应该在客运之余参加货运。如果有必要的话，小汽车也应该动员出来参加货运。只有坚决地采取这些措施，才能扭转运输紧张的局面。
    除了发动群众，动员一切能够动员的人力和运输工具以外，交通运输部门还必须充分发掘自己内部的潜力，加速车辆和船舶的周转，用土办法来增加通过能力，这些都是大有可为的。特别是加强企业内外的协作，更可以迅速增加运力。为了挖掘运输部门内部的潜力，各个运输企业都应该学习锦州铁路局的领导经验。
    为了展开一个全民运输运动，各地有必要在党委的统一领导下成立运输指挥部或办公室，由党委书记挂帅，做好政治动员，雷厉风行地调集一切可以调集的人力和各种各样的运输工具，突击完成运输战线上的紧急任务。
    我们相信，只要把全民运输运动组织起来，运输紧张情况必能迅速改变。
