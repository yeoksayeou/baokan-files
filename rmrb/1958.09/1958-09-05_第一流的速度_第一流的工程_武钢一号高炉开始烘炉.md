Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 4th: The Wuhan Iron and Steel (Group) Corporation's No. 1 blast furnace began baking ahead of schedule at 11:55 PM last night. Encouraged by the call of the Political Bureau Enlarged Meeting of the Party Central Committee, the workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant are striving to ignite and smelt iron in this blast furnace as quickly as possible.

This blast furnace, designed with the help of the Soviet Union, is a world-class large blast furnace, grand in scale and complex in structure. A single firebrick weighs 970 pounds; the furnace wall cooling water pipe has 40,000 joints. From the entry of ore and coke to the batching, weighing, and charging of materials, to the smelting of molten iron, casting into ingots, and transporting into the warehouse, the entire process is mechanized and electrified. Its early commissioning is of great significance. The Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 blast furnace was originally scheduled to produce iron on July 1st of next year, then changed to April 1st, and then to the end of this year; at the beginning of this year, the builders of Wuhan Iron and Steel, encouraged by the General Line, guaranteed to put it into production on October 1st.

The builders of Wuhan Iron and Steel have broken with convention and tried every means to accelerate the progress of the project and ensure the quality of the project, so that No. 1 blast furnace was fully connected to water, electricity, ventilation, gas, steam, and compressed air in late August.

What began baking last night was the main body of the blast furnace. The hot blast stove began baking on August 21st. Now, they are accelerating the installation of the last remaining equipment on the one hand, and baking the blast furnace on the other. Once these two tasks are completed, the blast furnace will be put into production immediately.

　　第一流的速度　第一流的工程
    武钢一号高炉开始烘炉
    据新华社武汉4日电　武钢一号高炉提前在昨夜十一点五十五分钟开始烘炉。为党中央政治局扩大会议号召所鼓舞的武钢炼铁厂职工，正在努力争取让这座高炉迅速点火炼铁。
    这座由苏联帮助我国设计的高炉，是世界第一流的大高炉，规模宏大，结构复杂。它的一块耐火砖就有九百七十斤重；炉壁冷却水管的接头达四万个。它从矿石、焦炭等进场到配料、秤料、装料，直到炼出铁水、铸成锭块、运入仓库，全部是机械化电气化操作。它的提前投入生产有着很大的意义。武钢一号高炉原计划在明年7月1日出铁，后来又改为4月1日，再改为今年年底；今年年初，武钢建设者在总路线的鼓舞下，又保证在10月1日投入生产。
    武钢建设者打破常规，想尽各种办法来加速工程进度，保证工程质量，使一号高炉在8月下旬就全部通水、通电、通风、通煤气、蒸汽和压缩空气等。
    昨夜开始烘烤的是高炉本体。热风炉从8月21日就开始烘烤。现在，他们正在一方面加紧安装最后一些设备，一方面烘烤高炉。这两项工作完成以后，高炉马上就投入生产。
