Denying Historical Geography and Logic
　　Cannot Conceal the Conspiracy to Expand Aggression
　　Soviet Newspapers Denounce Dulles' Statement
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 7th: "Soviet Russia" newspaper today published an article commenting on Dulles' statement, saying that Dulles' statement does not recognize history, geography, or logic. He insisted that Taiwan and the coastal islands of China do not belong to the People's Republic of China, but to the Chiang gang. He forcibly portrays Taiwan, occupied by the Chiang gang under the wing of US imperialists, as a country, while referring to the People's Republic of China, which has a population of 600 million, as some kind of geographical concept.
    The newspaper emphasized that Dulles' statement clearly shows the aggressive intentions of US imperialists in the Far East, which cannot be concealed by his hypocritical diplomatic rhetoric.

　　苏联报纸痛斥杜勒斯的声明
    据新华社莫斯科7日电  “苏维埃俄罗斯报”今天在一篇评论杜勒斯声明的文章中说，杜勒斯的声明不承认历史也不承认地理，更不承认逻辑。他硬说台湾和中国沿海岛屿不属于中华人民共和国，而属于蒋帮。他硬把在美帝国主义者卵翼下的蒋帮所占据的台湾说成是国家，而把拥有六亿人民的中华人民共和国说成是某种地理概念。
    这家报纸强调说，杜勒斯的声明十分明显地表明了美帝国主义者在远东的侵略意图，这个意图是不能够用他的虚伪的外交词令来掩盖的。
