The Red Flag People's Commune in Nanchong County, Sichuan, has transformed a simple commercial exchange town, Yingxi Market, into the commune's economic and cultural center.

This market was originally the location of the Yingxi Township People's Committee. Since the establishment of the People's Commune on August 20th by the forty-six agricultural cooperatives in the township, a comprehensive transformation of the market has been carried out. Originally, the market had one hundred and six households, excluding government offices and schools, of which fifty-four were purely engaged in business or semi-business, and the rest were farmers and residents without fixed occupations. There was a woodworking production team and an ironware production cooperative, but they could only produce simple farm tools and implements, and could not even manufacture threshing machines. As a result, the population engaged in production was small, while the commercial and consumer population was large; farmers and semi-farmers who participated in agricultural cooperatives mostly did not specialize in agriculture, but often went out to earn money through transportation or sat in teahouses. Such a market town was obviously not suitable for the further development of the economy and culture after the establishment of the People's Commune.

The district and township Party organizations decided to transform this market into an industrial base serving the agricultural production of the People's Commune and to establish the commune's backbone industries. The Party organization mobilized the masses to engage in extensive debate and, on the basis of the masses' conscious and voluntary participation, made adjustments to the industries, residents, and houses in the market. Those who were not suitable to remain in the market as workers and surplus vendors, semi-farmers, farmers, and residents without fixed occupations were moved out of the market and arrangements were made for them within the People's Commune. The thirty-nine houses vacated were used to establish fourteen factories for farm tools, fertilizers, pesticides, explosives, bricks and tiles, cement, rice milling, flour milling, winemaking, confectionery, rayon, gypsum, and earthenware jars. In addition to the original two hydroelectric power stations, another one was built, and three more are planned to be built to meet the power needs of the factories and the lighting needs of the whole market and nearby cooperative members.

The establishment of factories was carried out simultaneously with the further transformation of handicrafts. The newly built Red Flag Farm Tool Factory, with more than 120 workers, was established on the basis of the woodworking production team and the ironware production cooperative. The total capital for the construction of the factory was 25,000 yuan, of which 6,000 yuan was transferred from the handicraft cooperative, and the rest was mainly invested by the People's Commune. In the month since the factory was built, it has produced a variety of products such as threshing machines, wooden blowers, sweet potato slicing machines, ammonium chloride, bone meal, rayon, bricks, and tiles. This year, the total industrial output value of the entire market will reach 1.86 million yuan, which is 115,000 yuan more than the planned agricultural output value of the entire township.

These backbone factories also help other small factories in the commune with equipment and technology, and often send people down to help various production units repair farm tools and implements, thereby further strengthening the relationship between the market town and the countryside.

The commerce in the market, such as supply and marketing cooperatives, department stores, confectionery, tobacco and alcohol, catering, cooperative stores, and eight service stores, are all uniformly arranged by the People's Commune as its own commercial departments.

The establishment of an economic center has also driven the leap forward in cultural work. At present, the original joint clinic and health station in the market have been merged into a hospital, with ten health centers and forty-six health stations distributed in the commune's production units. In addition to the original elementary school, a vocational spare-time junior high school, a senior elementary school, and a technical school have been established.

Now the face of Yingxi Market is brand new. The "Delicious Street," which was known for its many idlers, teahouses, and hotels, has become the industrial center of the entire market. More than 80% of the houses in the market are factory buildings. The farm tools, implements, pesticides, and fertilizers needed by the People's Commune are all available in the market; the living materials needed by the cooperative members can also be guaranteed. The cooperative members praised the transformation of this market one after another, calling it the Leaping Forward Field.

### “好吃街”变成跃进场  红旗公社把消费集镇改造成经济文化中心

    “好吃街”变成跃进场
    红旗公社把消费集镇改造成经济文化中心
    四川南充县红旗人民公社把一个简单的商业交换的潆溪场建成了公社的经济和文化的中心。
    这个场原来是潆溪乡人民委员会的所在地。8月20日，全乡四十六个农业社建立起人民公社以来，对这个场进行了全面改造。全场原来除机关、学校外，有一百零六户居民，其中纯经商和半经商的有五十四户，其余是农户和无固定职业的居民。场上有一个木器生产小组和一个铁器生产合作社，只能生产简单的农具、工具，连打谷机也不能制造。因之，全场从事生产的人口少，商业和消费人口多；参加农业社的农户和半农户，多半不专务农，常出去跑运输赚钱，或坐茶馆。这样一个场镇，显然不能适应人民公社建立后经济和文化进一步大发展的要求。
    区、乡党组织决定把这个场改造成为人民公社农业生产服务的工业基地，建立起公社的骨干工业。党组织发动群众，大争大辩，在群众自觉自愿的基础上，对场上的行业、居民、房屋作了调整。把不适于留在场上当工人和多余的商贩、半商半农户、农户，以及无固定职业的居民，都搬出场外，在人民公社内作了安排。腾出的三十九幢房屋，先后建立了农具、化肥、农药、炸药、砖瓦、水泥、碾米、磨面、酿酒、糖果、人造纤维、石膏、坛罐等十四个工厂，除原有两个水电站外，又建成一个，准备再建三个，以满足工厂动力和全场及附近社员的照明需要。
    工厂的建立是同进一步改造手工业同时进行的。新建的拥有一百二十多名工人的红旗农具厂，就是以木器生产小组和铁器生产合作社为基础建立的。建厂的全部资金共为二万五千元，其中由手工业社转进的资金是六千元，其余部分，主要是人民公社的投资。建厂一个月来，已生产出打谷机、木制鼓风机、红苕切片机、氯化铵、骨粉、人造纤维、砖瓦等多种产品。今年全场工业总产值将达到一百八十六万元，比全乡农业计划产值多十一万五千元。
    这些骨干工厂还在设备技术方面帮助公社其他小厂，并经常派人下去帮助各生产单位修补农具、工具，从而更加密切了场镇与农村的关系。
    场上的商业，如供销社、百货、糖果、烟酒、饮食、合作商店和八个服务商店都由人民公社作了统一安排，作为自己的商业部门。
    经济中心的建立，也带动了文化工作的跃进。目前，场上原有的联合诊所和卫生所合并建成了一座医院，下设十个保健院和四十六个保健站，分布在公社的各生产单位。除原有一所小学，又建立职工业余初中和高小、技术学校各一所。
    现在潆溪场的面貌焕然一新。过去以闲人、茶馆、酒店多而得名的“好吃街”，变成了全场工业中心区，全场80％以上的房屋都是工厂的厂房，人民公社需要的农具、工具、农药、化肥，场上应有尽有；社员需要的生活资料也能保证供应。社员们对这个场的改造，连声称赞，把它叫作跃进场。
