Xinhua News Agency, September 21st — Mobilize and deliver a head-on blow to the American robbers who dare to invade our country! American robbers must get out of Taiwan! This is the unanimous will and determination of the people of Beijing.

Today, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and businessmen in Beijing abandoned their Sunday holiday and held anti-aggression rallies. They unanimously supported Foreign Minister Chen Yi's solemn statement and Soviet Chairman Khrushchev's warning to Eisenhower. They believe that the Chinese people must recover Jinmen and Mazu. As long as Jinmen and Mazu are not recovered, the military threat to our coast will not be lifted for a single day. People from all walks of life in Beijing also refuted Dulles's "ceasefire" fallacy at the rallies. They said that the tension in the Taiwan Strait is caused by the United States' aggressive actions against our country, and there is no "ceasefire" issue at all. Dulles is talking nonsense.

Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant pointed out that the United States' recent military actions are evidence of the United States' deliberate initiation of a war of aggression endangering world peace. They angrily condemned Eisenhower and Dulles, saying that nuclear weapons are not your exclusive possession, and atomic blackmail cannot scare us. Liberating Taiwan and Penghu, liberating Jinmen and Mazu are our internal affairs and the sacred responsibility of every Chinese. If you insist on interfering in our internal affairs, if you insist on imposing war on us, we will definitely fight without hesitation to resist aggression, safeguard our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and defend peace in the Far East and the world! Workers from the No. 2 blast furnace held a rally next to the blast furnace after work. Worker Li Fangtai said, "I am a steel militia, ready to defend the motherland at any time!" His partners continued, "Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement expressed the will of our workers. We will definitely guarantee to raise the hot blast furnace's wind temperature to 1,100 degrees before October 1st and strive to create a record for the thousand-ton furnace to strike back at the American aggressors."

Liu Fushan, an old worker at the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant, said at the rally, "Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands of Jinmen and Mazu have always been our motherland's territory. Now they are occupied by American imperialism, which is the greatest shame for the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation." They shouted: "We must liberate Jinmen and Mazu! We must liberate Taiwan! This is our right and our duty, and no one can stop us!"

The members of the Dongfanghong People's Commune held a field rally during their lunch break. In order to protect their beautiful life, they vowed to stand on the front line of fighting the aggressors. Tian Deshun, a militiaman from the commune, said angrily: "We will hold a gun in one hand and produce in the other. Wherever the American robbers dare to come from, we will resolutely eliminate them!" After the rally, the commune's militiamen immediately practiced shooting skills on the spot.

Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing held rallies in their barracks today. Meng Xianzhang, who was awarded the title of Third-Class Combat Hero in the Liberation War, was very indignant at Dulles's rant at the United Nations General Assembly. He said: "The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands is a continuation of the decades of civil war with Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous army. What does it have to do with the United States? However, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, who occupied our territory of Taiwan, falsely accused us of 'aggression.' What kind of logic is this? This is the logic of a robber! We want to warn Dulles that we know how to deal with robbers!" Xu Shao, a Second-Class Combat Hero from the radar searchlight unit, said: "The U.S. imperialist policy of atomic blackmail cannot scare people. The outcome of war depends on people, not on weapons themselves. In the past, we defeated Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous army armed by the United States with millet and rifles. The situation now is the same as then: justice is on our side. If there is any difference, it is that everyone knows that our strength today is incomparably stronger than in the past." He warned the American robbers to stop playing with fire immediately. The officers and soldiers unanimously expressed their readiness to fight at the rally.

Students from Tsinghua University held rallies in the afternoon, and more than 10,000 teachers, students, and staff held a general meeting in the evening. The teachers and students said: Be ready at all times, obey the call of the motherland, and fight the aggressors! Students from the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics said at the rally that they would step up military training. Once the motherland needs them, they would immediately go to the front line to fight for the integrity of the motherland's sacred territory and sovereignty. Teachers and students of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology are determined to build another small blast furnace of two to three cubic meters in ten days to produce more steel to strike at the aggressors. Students from the Beijing Institute of Mining proposed: "Be able to fight on horseback and write on foot, be both civil and military, and make an all-round leap forward. Heads can be broken, blood can flow, but the determination to liberate Taiwan cannot be shaken."

Shop clerks also expressed their willingness to put down their abacuses and take up guns to go to the front line at any time. Shop clerks from Wangfujing Department Store took time out of their extremely busy sales business to hold a rally. Female salesperson Li Shuqing said angrily: "We have issued eight warnings to the U.S. imperialists. They do not stop setting fires, but open their eyes and talk nonsense, telling us to 'ceasefire.' For inhuman robbers, the first thing is to be vigilant, and the second thing is to fight back fiercely!" The shop clerks of this store unanimously condemned Dulles's fallacy, expressed their intention to be vigilant and prepared, and supported Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement with practical actions.

    如果美国侵略者竟然不顾中国人民的一再警告和世界人民的坚决反对，胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，那末，我国团结一致的六亿人民，必将不惜牺牲，在保卫伟大祖国的神圣旗帜下，为反抗侵略而战，为维护祖国的主权和领土完整而战，为保卫远东和世界的和平而战！
    ——外交部长陈毅驳斥美国国务卿杜勒斯在联合国大会上发言的声明
    北京工农兵学商纷纷集会拥护陈外长声明
    一致主张迎头痛击美国强盗
    新华社21日讯　动员起来，给胆敢侵犯我国的美国强盗以迎头痛击！美国强盗必须滚出台湾去！这是北京人民举城一致的意志和决心。
    今天，北京市广大的工农兵学商，放弃星期天例假，纷纷举行反侵略集会。他们一致拥护陈毅外交部长的庄严声明和苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫对艾森豪威尔的警告。他们认为，中国人民一定要收复金门、马祖，金门、马祖一天不收复，我国沿海所受到军事威胁就一天不能解除，北京各界人民在集会中还驳斥了杜勒斯的“停火”谬论，他们说，台湾海峡局势的紧张，是美国对我国的侵略行为造成的，根本不存在“停火”问题，杜勒斯是胡说八道。
    石景山钢铁厂的工人指出：美国最近的军事行动，是美国蓄意发动侵略战争危害世界和平的罪证。他们愤怒地指责艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯说，核武器非你独有，原子讹诈吓不了我们。解放台湾、澎湖，解放金门马祖，是我们的内政，是我们每个中国人的神圣的责任，如果你们一定要干涉我们的内政，一定要把战争强加在我们头上，我们一定毫不犹疑地为反抗侵略、维护祖国的主权和领土的完整、保卫远东和世界和平而战！二高炉工人下班以后在高炉旁边举行了集会，工人李方泰说，我是钢铁民兵，随时准备保卫祖国！他的伙伴们接着说，陈毅外长的声明表达了我们工人的意志。我们一定保证在“十·一”前提高热风炉的风温到一千一百度，争取创造千吨炉的纪录，来回击美国侵略者。
    北京汽车制造厂老工人刘福山在集会上说：台湾、澎湖和金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，从来都是我们祖国的领土，现在被美帝国主义霸占着，这是我们中华民族优秀儿女的最大耻辱。他们高呼：我们一定要解放金门、马祖！一定要解放台湾！这是我们的权利，也是我们的义务，任何人都不能阻拦！
    东方红人民公社的社员们利用歇晌时间举行了田头集会。为了保卫自己美好的生活，他们誓言要站在打击侵略者的最前线。这个公社的民兵田德顺愤怒地说：我们一手拿枪，一手生产，美国强盗敢从哪里来，就坚决把它消灭在哪里！集会以后，公社的民兵们立即就地练习射击技术。
    中国人民解放军驻京部队的官兵们今天在他们的营房里分别举行了集会。在解放战争中被评为三级战斗英雄的孟宪章对杜勒斯在联合国大会上的谰言非常愤慨，他说：现在中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争是同蒋介石卖国军队打了几十年内战的继续，和美国有什么关系；而侵占我国领土台湾的美国国务卿杜勒斯却倒栽一把，反过来污蔑我们这是“侵略”。这是什么逻辑？这是强盗逻辑！我们要警告杜勒斯，我们是懂得怎样对付强盗的！雷达探照灯部队二级战斗英雄许少才说：美帝的原子讹诈政策是吓不了人的。战争的胜负决定于人，而不决定于武器本身。过去我们小米加步枪打败了日本帝国主义和美国武装起来的蒋介石卖国军。现在的情况和那时相同：正义在我们这一边。如果有所不同，那就是大家都知道的，今天我们的力量比过去无比的强大了。他警告美国强盗立即停止玩火。官兵们在集会上一致表示枕戈待命。
    清华大学的学生们在下午纷纷集会，晚上一万多师生员工又举行了大会。师生们纷纷表示：时刻准备着，听从祖国的召唤，打击侵略者！北京航空学院的学生们在集会上，个个磨拳擦掌，表示要加紧开展军事锻炼，祖国一旦需要，立即开赴前线，为维护祖国神圣的领土和主权的完整而战。北京钢铁学院师生们决心在十天内再建一座两三立方公尺的小高炉，多炼钢铁打击侵略者。北京矿业学院学生们提出：“上马能武，下马能文，文武双全，全面跃进。头可断，血可流，解放台湾立志不可摇。”
    商店的店员们也表示准备随时放下算盘拿枪上前线。王府井百货商店的店员们在异常繁忙的售货业务中抽暇举行集会。女售货员李淑清气愤地说：我们已经向美帝提出八次警告，他们不停止放火，却睁眼胡说叫我们“停火”。对于毫无人性的强盗，第一要警惕，第二要狠狠地回击！这个商店的店员们一致痛斥杜勒斯的谬论，表示要提高警惕，作好准备，并以实际行动拥护陈毅外长的声明。
