The following is a report from the *People's Liberation Army Daily*: The third batch of Chinese People's Volunteers, soon to return home victoriously, are making preparations for withdrawal while also preparing for combat, ready to obey the motherland's call and strike at any invaders at any time.

    The soldiers of an all-around artillery group are polishing their cannons and shells until they gleam. Group Leader Liu Yifei said with full confidence: "All the soldiers in our group, including the cooks and medics, are excellent gunners. Our vehicles are ready to move at any time, and our artillery can be put into battle at any moment. We are always ready to accept the call of the motherland. If American imperialism dares to provoke a war, we will resolutely eliminate it wherever it invades!" Xu Fenglin, the company commander of the Second Company, has spent seven years in Korea. In the summer counterattack of 1953, their artillery, along with fraternal artillery units, wiped out an entire enemy regiment in a rapid barrage. The enemy spent seven days just carrying away the corpses. Later, two American reconnaissance planes came to correct artillery fire, but they were shot down by our anti-aircraft artillery. One of the pilots hastily parachuted, and was captured as soon as he landed. Xu Fenglin said: "American devils are no match for us in battle, but they are very experienced in being prisoners. After being captured, this pilot bowed and saluted us. Now our country and our army are stronger than ever before. If American imperialism dares to touch a single hair on the heads of our 600 million people, it will be signing its own death warrant!"

    On the eve of the withdrawal, the troops are still engaged in intensive combat training. On the morning of September 10th, artillery fire thundered on the training ground of a certain unit, where a "strengthened detachment live-fire tactical exercise" was held. This exercise was a review of the unit's combat effectiveness and a powerful demonstration against the military provocations launched by American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area. The officers and soldiers were in high spirits during the exercise. They climbed mountains and crossed ridges, their bodies soaked in sweat and mud, and their actions were as realistic as in actual combat. Wu Shaoqing, the squad leader of the Sixth Squad, who was rated as a "Five-Good Soldier," led his squad to be the first to occupy Height 270 in just three minutes. When Fifth Gunner Li Xukong discovered enemy artillery firepower points on the protruding part to the right of Height 270, he immediately proposed: "We must destroy the enemy's firepower points to ensure that the infantry occupies the assault starting area!" After they destroyed the enemy's artillery firepower points with powerful artillery fire and accurate shooting, the infantry smoothly occupied the assault starting area. All-around gunner Yuan Xianfu hit two targets with only two shells. As a result of the exercise, the target hit rate reached 90%, earning an "excellent" rating.

    War preparations are currently penetrating into all units. The repair company of a certain unit launched a war preparedness competition, greatly improving work efficiency. Some even completed four days' worth of tasks in two days. The higher authorities originally stipulated that the company should repair thirteen vehicles in twelve days, but they completed the task of repairing seventeen vehicles in seven days.

    Currently, officers and soldiers of all units are closely monitoring the development of the situation in the Taiwan Strait, ready to obey the motherland's call at any time and go anywhere to strike at the invaders.

    志愿军第三批归国部队
    密切注视台湾海峡形势
    准备随时听从祖国调遣到任何地方打击侵略者
    据解放军报消息　不久就要胜利回国的志愿军第三批归国部队，一边进行撤军准备工作，一边作好了战斗准备，以便随时听候祖国的调遣去打击侵略者。
    某部全能炮手团的战士们，把大炮和炮弹擦拭得闪闪发光。团长刘一飞信心百倍地说：“我们全团的士兵，包括炊事员、卫生员，都是优秀的炮手，我们的车辆随时可以出动，火炮随时可以投入战斗，我们时刻准备接受祖国的召唤。如果美帝国主义敢于挑起战争，它从哪里侵犯，我们就坚决地把它消灭在哪里！”二连连长徐奉林率领的炮兵连，已经在朝鲜度过了七年。1953年的夏季反击战中，他们的火炮和兄弟炮兵一起一个急速射消灭了正在集结的一个团的敌人。敌人搬尸就搬了七天。后来飞来了美国鬼子的两架炮兵校正机，又被高射炮兵揍了下来，其中一个驾驶员慌忙跳伞，刚一着陆就被逮住。徐奉林说：“美国鬼子打仗不是我们的对手，做俘虏倒很有经验。这个驾驶员被我们俘虏以后，向我们又哈腰又敬礼。现在我们国家和我们的部队比过去任何时候更强大了，如果美帝国主义敢动我国六亿人民的一根汗毛，它就是自己找死！”
    在撤军前夕，部队仍在紧张地进行战斗训练。10日上午，某部的演习场上，炮声隆隆，在那里举行了一次“加强分队实战战术演习”。这次演习是对部队战斗力的一次检阅，也是对美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区发动军事挑衅的一次有力的示威。官兵们在演习中情绪异常高涨，他们爬山越岭，浑身浸透了汗水和泥水，动作逼真的像实战一样。被评为五好标兵的六班班长吴少清，带领全班只用三分钟就第一个占领了二七零高地。五炮长李续孔发现了二七零高地右侧突出部分的敌炮兵火力点时，就马上提出：“我们要摧毁敌人火力点，保证步兵占领冲击出发地区！”当他们用强大的炮火、准确地射击摧毁了敌人炮兵火力点后，步兵就顺利地占领了冲击出发地区。全能炮手袁贤福只用两发炮弹就命中了两个目标。演习结果，目标命中率达到90％，获得了“优秀”成绩。
    战备工作目前已深入到各个单位。某部修理连展开了战备竞赛，大大地提高了工作效率，有的甚至两天完成了四天任务。上级原先规定这个连队十二天修好十三台车，但是他们七天就完成了修好十七台车的任务。
    现在，各部队官兵正密切注视着台湾海峡局势的发展，准备随时听从祖国的调遣，到任何地方去打击侵略者。
