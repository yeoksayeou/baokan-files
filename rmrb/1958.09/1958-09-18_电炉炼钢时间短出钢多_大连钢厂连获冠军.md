Luda, September 16th. The Dalian Steel Plant, which won the national electric furnace steelmaking championship in July, has recently launched a "satellite" of large-scale bumper harvests.

In the ten days or so from the end of August to the beginning of September, this steel plant continuously set new daily output records, exceeding the newly proposed leap forward plan by about 8%. In the past, it was a novelty to produce a furnace of steel in three to five hours on a cold-charged electric furnace. Recently, the steelmaking workers at the Dalian Steel Plant have rapidly produced over seventy furnaces of steel in just over two hours. On September 2nd, the steelmaking experts of the No. 1 electric furnace created a record of two hours and two minutes to smelt a furnace of alloy steel. On September 11th, they even created a record of one hour and fifty-eight minutes to smelt a furnace of alloy steel, breaking the past argument that electric furnace steelmaking could not cross the two-hour mark.

The steel produced by the Dalian Steel Plant is an important material urgently needed for manufacturing metallurgical equipment, automobiles, machine tools, generators, etc. In July, the electric furnace utilization coefficient (tons of steel produced per kilovolt-ampere of the electric furnace transformer per day and night) of this plant reached 28.338, winning the "championship" of national electric furnace steel plants. In August, the utilization coefficient further increased to 28.593, ranking among the world's advanced electric furnaces. Under the situation of successive victories, the factory's Party committee decided to plant the red flag on a higher peak with the spirit of continuous revolution, and put forward the slogan of striving to "double steel production this year compared with last year." This new leap forward target is more than 50% higher than the original target. This target requires the steel produced in the last four months of this year to exceed the total output of the first eight months.

The new leap forward plan greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the workers. At the beginning of September, the steel production of this plant showed a situation of daily great leaps forward. Since September 1st, this plant has continuously created new daily production records, with an average daily output exceeding the leap forward plan by 8%. The average daily utilization coefficient of the electric furnace increased at an unprecedented rate to 33.057. The utilization coefficient of the No. 1 electric furnace of this plant reached 31.731 in August, which was the most dazzling red flag on one side of the national electric furnaces at that time. However, in less than ten days, all the electric furnaces of this plant worked hard to move forward, and the average daily utilization coefficient of the No. 1 electric furnace jumped to 37.75 since September.

### 电炉炼钢时间短出钢多  大连钢厂连获冠军

    电炉炼钢时间短出钢多
    大连钢厂连获冠军
    本报旅大16日电　获得7月份全国电炉炼钢厂冠军的大连钢厂，最近又射出大面积丰收“卫星”。
    这个炼钢厂在8月底到9月初的十多天内，连续创造日产量最高纪录，钢产量比新提出的跃进计划超过8％左右。过去，在冷装料的电炉上用三至五小时炼出一炉钢是一件新鲜的事情，最近大连钢厂炼钢工人用两个多小时快速炼出的钢就有七十多炉。一号电炉的炼钢能手们在9月2日创造了两小时零二十分炼一炉合金钢的最高纪录。11日更创造了一小时五十八分炼一炉合金钢，打破了过去被认为电炉炼钢不能跨越两小时的大关的论调。
    大连钢厂生产的钢种是当前制造冶金设备、汽车、机床、发电机等急需的重要材料。7月份这个厂电炉利用系数（电炉的变压器每千伏安一昼夜炼出的钢吨数）达到二八点三三八，荣获全国电炉炼钢厂的“冠军”。8月份利用系数又提高到二八点五九三，跃居世界先进电炉的前列。工厂党委在节节胜利的形势下，决定以不断革命精神把红旗插在更高峰，提出了争取“今年钢产量比去年翻一番”的口号，这个新的跃进指标比原来的指标上升50％以上。这个指标要求今年最后四个月炼出的钢超过前八个月的产量的总和。
    新的跃进计划大大激发了职工们的干劲。9月份一开始，这个厂钢产量就出现了天天大跃进的局面。9月1日以来，这个厂连续创造日产新纪录，平均日产量超过了跃进计划8％，电炉日平均利用系数以空前的速度激增到三十三点零五七。这个厂一号电炉8月份利用系数达到三十一点七三一，是当时全国电炉一面最夺目的红旗。可是，不到十天时间，这个厂所有的电炉奋力向前，一号电炉9月份以来日平均利用系数猛跳到三十七点七五。
