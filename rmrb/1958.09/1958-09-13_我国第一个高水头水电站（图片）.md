China's First High-Head Hydropower Station

China's first large-scale high-head hydropower station developed across a river—the second-stage power station of the Yili River Hydropower Station—has recently been completed and put into operation four months ahead of schedule, marking the first decisive victory in the construction of the Yili River large-scale Hydropower Station.

The Yili River Hydropower Station is located on the Yunnan-Dianbei Plateau, with a total installed capacity of nearly 400,000 kilowatts. The second-stage power station was the first to be constructed, with an installed capacity of 18,000 kilowatts. The second-stage power station has completed its reinforced concrete dam, which is 42 meters high and 140 meters long. Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Chuanguo photographed.
