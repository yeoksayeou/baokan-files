Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 17th: The 200,000 soldiers of the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are actively preparing to obey Chairman Mao's call and return to the front lines to defend the motherland. Currently, they are intensifying production with soaring enthusiasm to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan and counter the American aggressors with practical actions.

From the Tarim Basin to the reclamation areas along the Manas River, rallies and demonstrations have been held in wastelands, cotton fields, and factory workshops in recent days, denouncing the aggressive crimes of US imperialism. Pan Fulian, a veteran Red Army soldier who participated in the Long March, said: Premier Zhou's statement speaks our minds. We annihilated millions of Kuomintang reactionary troops armed by the United States in the past, and we will certainly be able to defeat the American aggressors and liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan. Su Changfu, a car driver who created the national record of 410,000 kilometers of safe driving without major repairs, is determined to increase his record to 500,000 or 600,000 kilometers. He said: I will crush the American bandits under the wheels of my advancing car.

Under the slogan of "Turning Anger into Strength," the 200,000 soldiers are determined to go all out and launch a greater high tide of production leap forward. Their slogan is: "Producing one more jin of grain and one more cotton boll is adding one more share of strength to strike at US imperialism." Soldiers from various farms are working day and night to strengthen the later-stage management of the fields and carry out the "Double Hundred Piculs of Cotton and Thousand Jin of Grain" movement, striving for a bumper harvest of both grain and cotton this year. The wasteland reclamation army is realizing the comprehensive mechanization of wasteland reclamation and will complete a wasteland area equivalent to 3 million mu of the past eight years in the last four months of this year. The steel warriors have recently established many small and indigenous blast furnaces in northern and southern Tianshan Mountains and are determined to produce 20,000 tons of iron and 5,000 tons of steel this year, where not even a single jin of steel was produced in the past.

Many of these troops are heroes from the domestic revolutionary war, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Liberation War, and have made countless contributions to the liberation of the people of the motherland. Since turning to peaceful construction, they have transformed a large number of barren beaches in northern and southern Tianshan Mountains into oases with heroic labor, establishing 102 mechanized farms, pastures, and many machinery repair shops and steel factories. More than 4,000 people have become tractor drivers and car drivers. Once the motherland needs them, these people can become excellent tank drivers and soldiers on the transportation lines.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 17th: The 100,000 transferred soldiers in the Mishan Reclamation Area, while preparing to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and return to the front lines, are intensifying production and construction to counter the military provocations of the American aggressors with practical actions.

The action slogan of this construction army is: producing one more grain is adding one more bullet to eliminate the American aggressors; increasing one more share of labor is increasing one more share of power to strike at the aggressors. The reclamation area originally planned to reclaim 5 million mu this year, now raised to 6 million mu, and each tractor has increased from an average of 75 mu of wasteland reclamation per shift in the past to 90 mu.

After participating in the demonstration against US imperialist aggression, more than 400 transferred soldiers from the 850 Farm rushed to accumulate more than 8,000 tons of fertilizer in several nights. The second production team of the livestock farm stepped up grass cutting, increasing from 400 bundles of grass per person per day to 600 bundles. The transferred soldiers in the Qingshan Farm, who are engaged in steel production, are determined to produce steel this year to support the front lines.

At the same time, these 100,000 transferred soldiers have strengthened military training. Some farms have adopted the establishment of platoons, companies and battalions like the regular army. In production and life, they maintained the combat style of the army, ensuring that once the motherland needs them, all the troops will immediately return to the front lines and eliminate the enemy.

    新疆建设兵团和密山垦区转业军人向祖国保证
    平时开荒多打粮　战时立即奔前方
    新华社乌鲁木齐17日电　中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设兵团二十万大军积极准备听候毛主席召唤，重上前线，捍卫祖国；目前，他们正以冲天干劲加紧生产，支援解放台湾的斗争，以实际行动回击美国侵略者。
    从塔里木盆地到玛纳斯河两岸各个垦区，连日来都在荒地上、棉田里和各个工厂车间，举行各种集会和游行示威，声讨美帝国主义的侵略罪行。曾经参加过长征的红军老战士潘福连说：周总理声明说出我们心里话。过去我们消灭了美国武装的几百万国民党反动军队，现在也一定能打垮美国侵略者，解放金门、马祖和台湾。创造四十一万公里安全行驶和无大修全国最高纪录的汽车驾驶员苏长福，决心要把他的纪录提高到五十万、六十万公里，他说：我要把美国强盗碾碎在前进的车轮之下。
    在“化愤怒为力量”的口号下，二十万大军决心鼓足干劲，掀起更大的生产跃进高潮。他们的口号是：“多生产一斤粮食、一朵棉花就是增加一份打击美帝国主义的力量”。各农场的战士正日夜不停地加强田间后期管理，开展“双百皮棉千斤粮”的运动，力争今年粮棉双丰收，开荒大军正在实现开荒全面机械化，要在今年最后四个月完成相当于过去八年的三百万亩的开荒面积，钢铁战士最近在天山南北建立起许多小高炉和土高炉，决心在过去不生产一斤钢铁的情况下，今年炼铁二万吨，炼钢五千吨。
    这支大军当中有很多是国内革命战争、抗日战争和解放战争中的英雄，为解放祖国人民建立过无数功勋；转入和平建设以来，他们以英雄的劳动，把天山南北大批荒滩开垦成绿洲，建立起一百零两个机械化农场、牧场和很多机械修配厂、钢铁厂等。有四千多人已成为拖拉机手和汽车司机，一旦祖国需要，这些人可以成为优秀的坦克手和运输线上的战士。
    新华社哈尔滨17日电　密山垦区十万转业军人，在时刻准备响应祖国的召唤，重返前线的同时，正在加紧生产建设，以实际行动反击美国侵略者的军事挑衅。
    这支建设大军的行动口号是：多打一颗粮食，就是增加一颗消灭美国侵略者的子弹；多增加一分劳动，就是多增加一分打击侵略者的力量。垦区原订今年垦荒五百万亩，现在提高为六百万亩，每台拖拉机由过去平均一个班次垦荒七十五亩，提高到九十亩。
    在参加反对美帝国主义侵略的游行示威以后，八五○农场四百多名转业军人几个夜晚突击积肥八千多吨。畜牧场的第二生产队，加紧了割草，由每人每天割草四百捆，提高到六百捆。青山农场大搞钢铁的转业军人，决心今年炼出钢铁，支援前线。
    同时，这十万转业军人加强了军事训练，有的农场采取了部队的班、排、连的建制，在生产和生活上，保持了部队的战斗作风，保证一旦祖国需要，全部人马立即重返前线，消灭敌人。
