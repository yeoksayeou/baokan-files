He was accompanied by Major General Hardy, Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Pacific Command Headquarters, and others.

Felt arrived in Taiwan after attending the SEATO military advisors' conference in Bangkok. He will hold talks with Chiang Kai-shek.

    费耳特是在参加了在曼谷召开的东南亚集团国家军事顾问会议之后来到台湾的，他将同蒋介石举行会谈。费耳特在记者招待会上大肆叫嚷台湾地区“局势严重”，吹嘘台湾地区美国侵略军拥有“强大的实力”，说它们“足够”应付任何局势。
