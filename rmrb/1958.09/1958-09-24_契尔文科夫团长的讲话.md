Comrade Mayor Peng Zhen, dear Chinese comrades and friends!

    I am entrusted by the Bulgarian National Assembly, and on behalf of the Bulgarian National Assembly, and in the name of Comrade Damyanov, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly, to extend to you our warm respect and express our deep gratitude. Thank you for inviting us to visit your great country and to learn about the amazing leaps forward you are now making under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its Chairman, our dear friend Comrade Mao Zedong. We sincerely thank you for your fraternal hospitality and the warm welcome you have given us since our arrival. We also thank you for the warm words you have spoken about our people and the high praise you have given to the work of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

    True friendship links us together, and links us together forever, because although our two countries have different historical, economic and cultural conditions, our paths are the same. Our interests are consistent; we protect the doctrine that guides our struggle and construction like the apple of our eye—Marxism-Leninism and its purity, so that it is free from any revisionist attempts to infringe upon it. We are loyal members of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. We will do our utmost to strengthen the unity and cohesion of this camp.

    Our people love and respect the Chinese people. Our people believe that it is their supreme honor and happiness to have such a loyal friend of 600 million Chinese people who are steadfastly advancing towards the victory of socialism. The visit to our country last year by the Chinese parliamentary delegation headed by Comrade Peng Zhen was an important contribution to the development and strengthening of Sino-Bulgarian friendship. We hope that the visit of our parliamentary delegation to China will contribute to further consolidating Bulgarian-Chinese friendship.

    Now, when the American imperialists and their pathetic lackeys, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, are brazenly provoking the People's Republic of China, we cannot but express here the full support of our people for the great Chinese people and their government. All our people unanimously support People's China and condemn the aggressors. Our people firmly believe that the imperialist conspiracy in the Taiwan Strait will be completely bankrupt. Taiwan and all other islands seized by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have been Chinese territory since ancient times, and it is a completely just and reasonable demand for these territories to return to the embrace of the motherland, to return to the People's Republic of China. The people of the world stand on the side of the People's China in this just cause.

    Please allow me, and please join me in a toast to the further prosperity and vigorous development of the People's Republic of China, to the Communist Party, to the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, the leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong! To the government of the People's Republic of China, to Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council!

    To the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, to the health of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee, to the health of Comrade Peng Zhen and all the Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee present, and to the health of all the members of the Committee!

    To our eternal and vital friendship!

    契尔文科夫团长的讲话亲爱的彭真市长同志，亲爱的中国同志和朋友们！
    我谨受保加利亚国民议会的委托，并代表保加利亚国民议会，并以国民议会主席团主席达米扬诺夫同志的名义向你们致以热烈的敬意，并表示深刻的谢意。感谢你们邀请我们访问你们伟大的国家，了解你们现在在中国共产党和它的主席、我们亲爱的朋友毛泽东同志的英明领导下惊人跃进的情况。我们衷心地感谢你们兄弟般的殷勤接待和我们一到这里后，你们所给予我们的热烈的欢迎。我们还感谢你们对我国人民说的那些热情的话，和你们对于保加利亚共产党工作的崇高评价。
    真正的友谊使我们联系在一起，永远地联系在一起，因为尽管我们两国历史、经济和文化条件各有不同，但是我们的道路是相同的。我们的利益是一致的；我们像保护眼珠一样，保护指导我们斗争和建设的学说——马克思列宁主义和它的纯洁性，使它免受任何修正主义企图的侵犯。我们是以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营忠实的成员。我们要全力加强这个阵营的团结和一致。
    我们的人民热爱和尊敬中国人民。我国人民认为，有这样一个忠实的、坚定地向着社会主义胜利前进的六亿中国人民的朋友，是自己的崇高荣誉和幸福。以彭真同志为首的中国议会代表团在去年对我国的访问是对发展和加强中保友谊的一个重要贡献。我们希望，我们议会代表团对中国的访问将是对进一步巩固保中友谊的贡献。
    现在，当美帝国主义者及其可怜的走狗蒋介石集团蛮横地对中华人民共和国进行挑衅的时候，我们在这里不能不表示我国人民完全支持伟大的中国人民及其政府。我们全体人民一致支持人民中国并谴责侵略者。我国人民坚信帝国主义在台湾海峡的阴谋必遭彻底破产。台湾和蒋介石匪帮所窃据的其他一切岛屿，自古以来就是中国的领土，这些领土重返祖国的怀抱，重返中华人民共和国的怀抱是完全公正的，合理的要求。世界各国人民在这个正义的事业中都站在人民中国方面。
    请允许我，并请大家一起为中华人民共和国的进一步繁荣昌盛和蓬勃发展，为共产党，为中华人民共和国主席、中国人民的领袖毛泽东同志干杯！为中华人民共和国政府，为国务院周恩来总理干杯！
    为全国人民代表大会常务委员会，为常务委员会委员长刘少奇同志的健康，为彭真同志和全体到会的常务委员会的副委员长们的健康，为委员会的全体委员的健康干杯！
    为我们的永恒的具有生命力的友谊干杯！
