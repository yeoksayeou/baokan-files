    Publish More Instructive News
    We deeply welcome the report in the People's Daily on September 3rd about the people's courts in various counties and cities of Shandong Province adopting the method of mass debates to handle cases. On the evening we saw the newspaper, all the cadres in our court studied and discussed it. Everyone agreed that their method was correct. We are willing to learn from them. We hope that the People's Daily will publish more instructive news like this in the future.

    多发表有指导性的消息
    9月3日人民日报登载的山东省各县市人民法院采取群众辩论的方法处理案件的报道，我们深为欢迎。看到报纸的当天晚上，我院全体干部就进行了学习讨论，大家一致认为他们的方法是正确的。我们愿意向他们学习。希望人民日报今后多发表这样有指导性的消息。
