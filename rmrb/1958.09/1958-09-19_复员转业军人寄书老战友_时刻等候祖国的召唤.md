Demobilized and Transferred Soldiers Send Books to Old Comrades
Awaiting the Motherland's Call at All Times
    Dear Comrades-in-arms:
    I am a transferred soldier. Three years ago, I was transferred from the army, and thanks to the Party's care and cultivation, I got the opportunity to study at the Renmin University of China. But since leaving the team, I have always retained a deep affection for the army—this heroic and powerful collective. I am always encouraged and proud of its achievements and victories. Especially the recent good news from you, which has increased my love for this collective.
    The war provocations of American imperialism have aroused the anger of all the students in our school. The students of our school have formed military training organizations, learning military technology, and are ready to listen to the call of the motherland at any time. We demobilized soldiers—your comrades-in-arms—are even more eager. When the motherland needs it, we will surely pick up our guns again, go to battle positions, and fight the enemy side by side with you.
    Yi Rui, Renmin University of China
    To the Liberation Army on the Fujian Front:
    In the past, I also wore a military uniform and held a gun, jointly defending the construction of the motherland. It was only because of the needs of the motherland that I left the army in 1957 and embarked on a construction post. Although several years have passed, I have not forgotten my skills in killing the enemy at all. As long as the motherland calls, I will definitely return to the front line and punish the heinous enemy with you. Before the motherland calls, I promise to do a good job in production and fully support you.

    复员转业军人寄书老战友
    时刻等候祖国的召唤
    亲密的战友：
    我是一个转业军人。三年前由部队转业，由于党的关怀和培养，使我得到了学习的机会——到中国人民大学学习。但是从离队至今，我总对部队——这一个英勇的强大的集体，保留着深深的感情。我总为它的成就和胜利，而感到鼓舞和自豪。特别是近日来从你们那里传来的捷报，更增加了我对这一集体的热爱。
    美帝国主义的战争挑衅，激起了我校全体同学的愤怒。我校同学都组成了军训组织，学习军事技术，随时听候祖国的召唤。我们复员军人——你们的战友，更是迫不及待。当祖国需要的时候，我们一定会重新拿起枪杆，走向战斗岗位，和你们并肩打击敌人。
    中国人民大学　伊　锐福建前线解放军各位战友：
    过去，我也和你们一样穿着军装，拿着枪杆，共同捍卫着祖国的建设。只是因为祖国的需要，我才于1957年离开了部队，走上了建设岗位。时间虽然过去了好几年，但对于杀敌本领，我一点也没有忘记。只要祖国召唤，我一定重返前线，和你们一块惩办万恶的敌人。在祖国没有召唤以前，我保证搞好生产，全力支援你们。四川泸州市东门路九号　黄瑞成
