    Delivery to the Door
    The Harbin Railway Station's delivery-to-the-door service is welcomed by brother enterprises.

    In the past, after goods were transported, the consignees had to pick them up themselves. Fines were imposed if the deadline was exceeded, leading to many disputes. Since the implementation of the delivery-to-the-door method, not only have the procedures for receiving goods been simplified, but the turnover of goods has also been accelerated, ensuring timely supply for industrial and agricultural construction and the market.

    送货到家
    哈尔滨火车站送货到家，受到兄弟企业的欢迎。
    过去，货物运到后，都是货主自己取，超过规定时间就罚款，扯皮的事情很多。实行送货到家办法后，不仅简化了领货手续，而且还加速了货物周转，保证及时供应工农业建设与市场上的需要。
