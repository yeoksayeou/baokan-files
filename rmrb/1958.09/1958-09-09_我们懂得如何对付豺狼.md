    The American aggressors are resorting to conspiracies and using force to unreasonably occupy our territory of Taiwan. Recently, they have openly expanded their scope of aggression in the Taiwan Strait area to our coastal islands, sending a large number of warships and aircraft to carry out military provocations and war threats against the Chinese people, arousing unparalleled anger among the Chinese people. This is intolerable to any Chinese. Liberating the coastal islands and liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair and no foreign interference is allowed. The great Chinese people have the firm confidence and sufficient strength to smash the invaders' aggression. Today, when the East wind prevails over the West wind, the imperialists are going downhill step by step. Their arrogance only proves their loss of reason during their final death throes. The U.S. imperialists have fallen into unprecedented isolation and have become the criminals of the world.
    The Chinese people's just struggle has received strong support from the people of all countries. We know how to deal with vicious jackals. We resolutely support Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area. We will certainly rise up in self-defense and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate the invaders.

    我们懂得如何对付豺狼
    欧阳予倩
    美国侵略者玩弄阴谋并使用武力，无理霸占我国领土台湾，最近公然把在台湾海峡地区的侵略范围扩展到我国沿海岛屿，派来大批军舰和飞机，对中国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，激起了中国人民无比的愤怒。这是任何一个中国人所不能容忍的。解放沿海岛屿，解放台湾，是中国的内政，决不许外国干涉。伟大的中国人民有坚强的信心和充分的力量，粉碎侵略者的进犯。在东风压倒西风的今天，帝国主义者一步步走向下坡，狂妄的行为只证明是他们回光反照时的丧失理智。美帝国主义者已陷于空前孤立，成了全世界的罪人。
    中国人民的正义斗争得到各国人民的有力支持。我们懂得如何对付狠毒的豺狼，我们坚决拥护周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，一定奋起自卫，坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭侵略者。
