Harbin Miscellany

I. Starting with "Harbin" Brand Ink
　　
In Harbin, there is an "unattended store." When we entered this store, we were immediately attracted by the beautifully packaged "Harbin" scientific ink. One reason was that we needed to buy ink, and the other was that the product was truly beautiful. This is one of eighteen local industrial products in Harbin whose quality exceeds or meets international standards. This ink was launched in April of this year, so it is a flower of the Great Leap Forward. This "Harbin" brand ink surpasses the American "Parker" brand ink in that, in addition to having all the advantages of "Parker," its corrosiveness is lower by 0.0013 grams.
　　
Dear reader, perhaps you will say: Since there are eighteen kinds of products that reach or exceed international standards, why pick ink as an example? Isn't ink a small gadget?
　　
However, I mention ink here (and must also add in passing that China has already produced several kinds of ink that surpass "Parker," and "Harbin" brand is produced by Harbin's local industry) because I recalled a right-wing argument I heard two years ago. After the Soviet Union produced fountain pens, a rightist shook his head and said: It's far worse than Parker! Then he extrapolated from this that the level of development of Soviet industrial technology was inferior to that of the United States. At the time, I coldly retorted: Do you really think that the Soviet Union, which is capable of manufacturing atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, does not even have the technology to make a good fountain pen? The rightist shrugged his shoulders dismissively and walked away.
　　
Rightists specialize in spreading their absurd anti-Soviet and anti-socialist poison in these small areas.
　　
I mention ink here to illustrate one point: No matter the size of the industry, no matter what kind of industry, if our socialist countries are determined to surpass capitalist countries, they will surpass them sooner or later.
　　
The production of ink falls within the scope of the chemical industry. Our chemical industry has always been backward, but we want to fill this blank spot. Sure enough, it has now begun to blossom everywhere.
　　
Speaking only of Harbin's local industry, vigorously developing the chemical industry is a noteworthy thing. Harbin is building thirty-one chemical factories this year, and sixty-five more will be built within five years; this is not just about manufacturing ink. Among those being built this year are sulfuric acid, carbolic acid, acetic anhydride, synthetic ammonia, calcium carbide, and electrolytic salt. These are all basic chemical industries. From here, industries such as rayon, rubber, and plastics can be developed, and these can be accomplished in a short period of time. The plastics factory that has already started production ranks second in the country (one in Shanghai ranks first), but in terms of scale, it is the largest in the country (as of now).
　　
We visited the preparatory office of the fiberglass factory. This is set up inside the oil factory, and although it is called a preparatory office, it has already started production. The construction of a new factory has been approved, and soon it will be producing this most valuable insulation material for the electrical industry in large quantities.
　　
But please do not misunderstand, Harbin's industry is not just limited to what has been mentioned here. We should remember that during the First Five-Year Plan period, the state invested in building twenty-two modern large enterprises in Heilongjiang Province; in Harbin, the electric motor factory, the measuring tool and cutting tool factory, the first tool manufacturing factory, and the linen factory, whose scale is the largest in the country, were among this batch. These large enterprises are laying eggs, and they will help local industries build twenty-nine new factories. As for the medium and small factories run by counties and townships, they are countless. Counting from the second half of May, more than one hundred and fifty medium and small factories are put into production every day. The idiom "springing up like mushrooms after rain" is not enough to describe this. Taking a remote township in Zhaoyuan County as an example, one hundred and thirty-one factories of various types were built within one month. This township is named Daxing Township, which is a truly "great prosperity"!
　　
As for counties with thousands of factories, there are already seven or eight. The top-ranked ten-thousand-factory special zone is the Hejiang Special Zone (these are the figures and situation I knew when I was in Harbin in late June, and of course there are new achievements now). This is truly blossoming everywhere!

### 哈尔滨杂记

　　哈尔滨杂记
　　一、从“哈尔滨”牌墨水说起
    哈尔滨市有一所“无人售货商店”。我们走进这商店后，立刻被装璜美丽的“哈尔滨”科学墨水吸引住了。一则是我们正要买墨水，二则是这产品实在漂亮。这是哈尔滨地方工业产品中十八种质量超过和达到国际水平之一种。这种墨水是今年4月间上市的，所以，它是大跃进中的一朵花。这种“哈尔滨”牌墨水超过美国“派克”牌墨水，在于它除了具有“派克”的一切优点而外，它的腐蚀性比“派克”低○·○○一三克。
    读者同志，也许你要说：既然有十八种产品达到或者超过国际水平，为什么单单拣墨水作例子？墨水不是小玩意儿吗？
    但是，我在这里提到墨水（也得带便补一句，超过“派克”的墨水，我国已经出产了好几种了，“哈尔滨”牌是哈尔滨地方工业生产的），因为想起两年前听到过的一种右派议论。这是在苏联生产了自来水笔以后，一个右派分子摇头摆尾说：比派克差远了！于是他引伸出苏联工业技术发达水平不及美国的结论。当时，我冷冷地反问他道：你以为能够制造原子弹和氢弹的苏联当真连造好一枝自来水笔的技术都没有么？这个右派分子不以为然地耸耸肩膀，掉臂而去。
    右派分子就是专在这些小地方来散播他们的荒谬的反苏反社会主义的毒素的。
    我在这里提到墨水，用意在说明一点：不论大小工业，不论哪种工业，我们社会主义国家如果存心要超过资本主义国家，迟早一定要超过的。
    墨水的生产属于化工范围。我们的化学工业向来是落后的，但是我们要填补这个空白点。果然现在已经开始普遍地在开花了。
    仅就哈尔滨市的地方工业来说，大力发展化学工业是一件值得注意的事情。哈尔滨市今年兴建的化学工厂就有三十一座，五年内还将建成六十五座；这里头，可不仅是制造墨水而已。今年兴建的，就有硫酸，石碳酸，醋干，合成铵，电石，电解食盐等。这些都是基本化学工业。从这里，就能发展人造纤维、橡胶、塑料等工业，这都是可以计日观成的。已经投入生产的塑料厂，在排行上是全国第二（上海的一个是排行第一），但在规模上却是全国第一（就现在说）。
    我们参观了玻璃丝厂筹备处。这是借设在油脂工厂里边的，名为筹备处，实在早已开始生产。已经批准了建新厂，不久即将大量生产这种最贵重的用于电器工业的绝缘材料。
    可是也请不要误会，哈尔滨的工业就只有这里提到的一些。我们应当记得，第一个五年计划期间，国家投资在黑龙江省兴建的现代化的大企业就有二十二项；在哈尔滨市，规模之大为全国第一的电机厂，量具刃具工厂，第一工具制造厂，亚麻厂等就是在这一批中间的。这些大企业正在下蛋，它们要帮助地方工业办新厂二十九座。至于县、乡举办的中、小工厂，那就数不清了。从5月下半月计，每天有一百五十多座中、小型工厂投入生产，这用“雨后春笋”这句成语来形容，也还嫌不够。仅以肇源县境内一个偏僻的乡来说，在一个月内居然建成了一百三十一座各式各样的工厂。这个乡名为大兴乡，这是名副其实的“大兴”了！
    至于千厂的县，已经有了七、八个。第一名的万厂专区是合江专区（这是6月下旬我在哈尔滨时知道的数字和情况，现在当然又有新捷报）。这真是遍地开花！
