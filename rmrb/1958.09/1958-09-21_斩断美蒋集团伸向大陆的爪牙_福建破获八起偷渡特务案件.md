Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 20th. Recently, the public security organs of Fujian Province, with the assistance of the broad masses, have successively cracked eight espionage cases of illegal border crossing, dispatched by the US Information Service and the Kuomintang "Intelligence Bureau," the Ministry of National Defense's Second Bureau, the Kinmen Defense Command Intelligence Team, and other special agent organizations. Spies Huang Kaixing, Xu Hongyan, Wang Xianian, Cai Zhongjian, Chen Yuanshan, Yu Changyuan, Yu Guo, Chen Shuicheng, and others were all captured, and a batch of U.S.-made special agent equipment and other evidence of crimes were seized.

Under the joint planning of the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agent organs, these special agents and spies attempted to infiltrate the mainland, find some remaining counter-revolutionaries and bad elements on the mainland to establish "Special Action Detachments," open up counter-revolutionary armed bases, steal information on our army's unit designations, weapons, equipment, engineering construction, and military transportation, and some were also tasked with "turning against" and carrying out destructive tasks such as surprise assassinations. All these conspiratorial activities are part of the US imperialist instigated Chiang Kai-shek clique's plan to harass and provoke the Chinese mainland, which once again exposes the ugly face of US imperialism in its hostility and aggression against the Chinese people.

The Fujian Provincial Public Security Organs have completed all interrogations of these special agent and espionage cases. The interrogation materials prove that these special agent bandits had committed many crimes endangering the people before the liberation of the mainland. After being sent to our area by the special agent organs, they continued to carry out counter-revolutionary criminal activities. For example, Xu Hongyan, a special agent of the Bandit Intelligence Bureau, once served as a major-level officer in the Kuomintang army. After sneaking into the mainland, in addition to contacting remaining counter-revolutionaries, he actively collected our military intelligence. When he was arrested, ten drafts of intelligence he secretly wrote to the enemy were seized. Special agent Wang Xialian had sneaked in twice last year and this year, actively collecting military intelligence and attempting to turn our personnel against us, his activities were very rampant. Yu Changyuan, a special agent of the Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of National Defense's Second Bureau, had been involved in banditry in the Pingtan and Tangyu areas in 1950. American spy Huang Kaixing had also served as the head of the pseudo-militia of seven townships, participated in the criminal activities of killing our underground workers Xu Linkeng and others, and colluded with bandits to carry out looting.

These special agents and spies had all undergone specialized training by the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agent organs. According to Huang Kaixing's confession, he was a loyal dog directly cultivated and trained by the US Information Service. Cai Zhongjian, the Kuomintang "Intelligence Bureau" Xiamen military liaison officer and assistant leader of the Yingxia Railway Action Group, had received specialized special agent training in Taipei. After Yu Changyuan received training at the Kuomintang "Guerrilla Cadre Class Land Demolition Team" in Taiwan in 1954, he received training at the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense's Second Bureau field class in Taiwan. Xu Hongyan and Wang Xialian had also received longer-term special agent training. The US-Chiang Kai-shek special agent organs placed great hope in the infiltration of these special agents. Before Cai Zhongjian, Wang Xialian, and others infiltrated, the director of the Kuomintang "Intelligence Bureau" and special agent boss Zhang Yanyuan and others personally summoned them for "education" and "encouragement" and gave them a farewell banquet. However, the US-Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy was only a futile effort. As soon as these special agents infiltrated the mainland, they fell into the people's dragnet. Chen Yuanshan, a special agent of the Kinmen Defense Command Intelligence Team, was discovered by bicycle worker Hong Zhuyuan and others as soon as he landed after illegally crossing the border, and was reported to the public security organs and captured.

    斩断美蒋集团伸向大陆的爪牙
    福建破获八起偷渡特务案件
    新华社福州20日电　福建省人民公安机关最近在广大群众的协助下，连续破获了美国新闻处派遣的和蒋帮“情报局”、国防部二厅、金门防卫部谍报队等特务机关派遣的八起偷渡特务案件。特务黄开兴、许鸿雁、王遐年、蔡忠坚、陈元善、俞昌元、余国、陈水成等全部落网，并缴获美制特务装备等罪证一批。
    在美蒋特务机关的共同策划下，这批特务间谍分子企图潜入大陆后，寻找大陆上一些残余反革命分子和坏分子建立“别动队”，开辟反革命武装基地，窃取我军队番号、武器、装备、工事构筑以及军事运输等情报，有的还负有“策反”和进行突击性暗害活动等破坏任务。所有这些阴谋活动，都是美帝国主义策动蒋介石集团对中国大陆进行骚扰挑衅计划的一部分，这就再一次暴露了美帝国主义敌视中国人民肆行侵略的狰狞面目。
    福建省公安机关对这批特务间谍案件已经全部侦讯完毕。侦讯材料证明，这些特务匪徒大都是在大陆解放前就干过许多危害人民的罪恶勾当，被特务机关派入我区以后，又在进行反革命的罪恶活动。如匪情报局特务许鸿雁就曾充当过国民党军队的少校级军官，潜入大陆后除联络残余的反革命分子外，并积极搜集我军事情报，在逮捕他的时候，曾缴获他向敌人密写情报的底稿十件。特务分子王遐年在去年和今年曾两次潜入，积极搜集军事情报和企图策反我方人员，活动十分嚣张。蒋帮国防部二厅特务俞昌元于1950年曾在平潭、唐屿一带为匪打劫。美国间谍黄开兴还曾担任过七个乡的伪民团团长，参与杀害过我地下工作人员徐林坑等三人的罪恶活动，并勾结土匪进行抢劫。
    这些特务间谍分子都曾经过美蒋特务机关专门训练。据黄开兴供称，他是美国新闻处直接培养训练出来的忠实走狗。蒋帮“情报局”厦门军事联络员兼鹰厦铁路行动助理组长蔡忠坚曾在台北接受专门特务训练。俞昌元1954年在台湾匪“游干班陆上爆破队”受训后，又在台湾匪国防部二厅外勤班受训。许鸿雁、王遐年也都受过较长期的特务训练。美蒋特务机关对这批特务的潜入都寄予很大的希望。蔡忠坚、王遐年等在潜入前，蒋帮“情报局”局长、特务头子张炎源等亲自召见进行“教育”和“鼓励”，并替他们饯行。但是美蒋的阴谋只是枉费心机，这些特务分子刚潜入大陆，就陷入人民的天罗地网中。金门防卫部谍报队特务陈元善，刚偷渡登陆，就被自行车工人洪助愿等发觉，报告公安机关捕获。
