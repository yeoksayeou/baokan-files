Dai People in Border Village Celebrate "Double Happiness"
By Our Correspondent Tian Lianggeng

	Before National Day, a grand celebration of the harvest and the establishment of the People's Commune, attended by over five thousand people, was held in a Dai village filled with subtropical scenery on the southwestern border of our motherland. This is Fapa Township in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province. The one thousand six hundred Dai peasant households from the surrounding fifty-five elementary agricultural producers' cooperatives, using the "one step to heaven" method, established the autonomous prefecture's first Dai People's Commune—the Red Flag People's Commune. That day, the border was filled with joy. In the early morning, the men, women, old, and young of the commune, according to the ancient customs of the Dai people, put on their festive national costumes, beat the earth-shaking elephant-foot drums and cymbals, and carried red flags and charts, gradually converging together. Such a grand gathering was a first in the Dai villages.

	At the conference, the commune first reviewed the heroic militia armed forces of over three hundred people. Then, the commune director, Bo Erhei Bao, reported to everyone on the commune's harvest situation and the beautiful prospects of the commune: this year, the total grain output of the commune increased by more than double compared to last year, with an average of three thousand five hundred catties of grain per person. Next year, we will increase grain production even more, and we will plant a large amount of subtropical cash crops such as sugarcane, coffee, and cotton, and establish a sugar factory with a daily output of two hundred and fifty tons. Within three years, we will replace all the simple bamboo fence houses with tile houses...

	The entire Mangshi dam area was stirred up by the establishment of the commune. Representatives from all over were sent to study and congratulate. The state cultural troupe and film team performed programs and screened films for the commune. The newly established club of the commune also sang a song "The People's Commune is Good" for the members. People revelled until late at night, forgetting the fatigue of fighting hard for fifteen days to welcome the establishment of the commune.

	In the process of agricultural cooperation, the Dai people saw the superiority of collective production; and in this year's Great Leap Forward, they encountered new difficulties that small cooperatives and elementary cooperatives could not solve. Therefore, when the situation of the national people vigorously running people's communes appeared, the Dai people, who had only recently organized elementary cooperatives, eagerly demanded to run people's communes. People posted more than a thousand big-character posters enthusiastically requesting to join the commune. In the fifteen days from brewing to building the commune, they accomplished major tasks that small cooperatives could not accomplish in the past. For two days, almost no one was to be found in the twenty-nine villages of the Red Flag People's Commune; men, women, old, and young, all went up the mountains to accumulate fertilizer. At the foot of Gaoligong Mountain, hundreds and thousands of piles of fertilizer suddenly appeared. The fertilizer accumulation reached one hundred and thirty million catties in two days, and the speed of fertilizer accumulation was several times faster than before. This is the beginning of a technical revolution in production for the Dai people, who have only recently become accustomed to accumulating fertilizer.

	The establishment of the commune also caught the commercial departments "off guard." When the commune's preparatory committee discussed the Great Leap Forward in production next year, it decided to invest 210,000 yuan to purchase agricultural machinery and new agricultural implements and other means of production. That night, after the decision was made, commune cadres rushed to Mangshi Town overnight, knocked on the door of the supply and marketing cooperative, awakened the sleeping sales staff, bought out the inventory of more than a dozen double-wheeled double-shared plows and more than fifty horse-drawn carts, and still felt it was not enough! Because the commune has a large population and great strength, an army of more than one thousand people repairing roads has built three highways with a total length of nine miles; it has also organized a smelting iron team of more than three hundred people for the first time in history, changing the history of the Dai people never producing iron. The newly built farm tool factory rushed to produce more than one hundred ox and horse carts and more than three thousand sets of ball bearings.

	At present, in addition to sending people to study production techniques such as cotton planting, iron casting, and lathe work, to prepare for a larger-scale development of industrial and agricultural production, the commune is fully engaged in iron smelting and autumn harvesting and planting.

    边寨傣族庆“双喜”
    本报记者  田良耕
    国庆节前，在祖国西南边境的一个充满着亚热带风光的傣族村寨里，举行了有五千多人参加的庆丰收、庆祝人民公社成立的大会。这里，是云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州的法帕乡。周围的五十五个初级农业生产合作社的一千六百多户傣族农民，用“一步登天”的办法，建立了自治州第一个傣族人民公社——红旗人民公社。这天，国境线上一片欢腾景象。清晨，公社的男女老少，就按照傣族的古老习俗，穿上民族的节日盛装，敲着震天动地的象脚鼓和铓钹，扛着红旗和图表，陆续汇聚在一起。这样盛大的集会，在傣族农村里还是第一次。
    在大会上，公社首先检阅了三百多人组成的雄赳赳的民兵武装队伍。接着，社主任波二黑保在会上向大家报告了公社的丰收情况，公社的美丽前景：今年全社粮食产量比去年增产一倍以上，每人平均有粮食三千五百斤。明年还要增产更多粮食，要大种甘蔗、咖啡、棉花等亚热带经济作物，办起日产二百五十吨的糖厂。三年内把简陋的竹篱笆房子全部改为瓦房……。
    整个芒市坝子都为公社的成立而哄动。各地都派代表来学习和庆贺。州文工团和电影队为公社演出节目和放映了电影。公社新成立的俱乐部还给社员们演唱了一支“人民公社好”的歌曲。人们狂欢直到深夜，忘却了为迎接办社而苦战了十五天的疲劳。
    在农业合作化的过程中，傣族人民看到了集体生产的优越性；而在今年的大跃进中，又遇到了小社和初级社不能解决的新困难。因此，当全国人民大办人民公社的形势出现，不久前才组织起初级社的傣族人民，就迫不及待地要求办人民公社。人们贴了一千多张热情要求入社的大字报。就在酝酿到建成公社的十五天中，干出了过去小社作不出的大事。有两天，红旗人民公社二十九个寨子中，几乎杳无一人，男女老少，一齐上山积肥。在高黎贡山麓，顿时出现了成百上千的肥堆。两天积肥就达一亿三千万斤，积肥进度比以往快好几倍。这对于刚刚习惯积肥不久的傣族，是生产上技术革命的开端。
    公社的成立，还把商业部门弄得个“措手不及”。公社筹委会在讨论明年生产大跃进时，决定投入二十一万元购买农业机器和新式农具等生产资料。当夜决定，公社干部就星夜赶到芒市镇，敲开供销社的大门，唤起熟睡的营业人员，把库存的十多部双轮双铧犁以及五十多部马车购买一空，还嫌不够！由于公社人多力量大，一千多人组成的修路大军，已修好三条共长九里的公路；还史无前例地组织起三百多人的炼铁大队，改变了从没产铁的傣族历史。新建的农具厂，赶制出一百多部牛、马车和三千多套滚珠轴承。
    目前，公社除派人出外学习种棉花、铸铁、车工等生产技术，为更大规模地发展工农业生产作准备以外，正全力投入炼铁和秋收秋种中。
