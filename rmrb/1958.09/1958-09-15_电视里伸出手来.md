A hand stretches out from the television

Eisenhower says it is necessary for the United States to "resist aggression," which is the jackal logic of the Eisenhower faction. Could it be that Chinese warships have sailed to Long Island? Could it be that Chinese troops have "invaded" New York? Jinmen and Matsu are located in Fujian, China, and Taiwan has belonged to us since ancient times, before the United States even existed. Yet you say Taiwan is a "vital interest" of the United States, you have the nerve to say that, you shameless! No matter how you distort the truth and play tricks, no matter whether you are on Rhode Island or in Washington, why is your hand so long, stretching across the Pacific Ocean directly to the Chinese coast?

    电视里伸出手来艾克说美国有必要“抵抗侵略”，这是艾克氏的豺狼派逻辑学。难道是中国军舰开到了长岛？难道是中国军队“侵略”了纽约？金门马祖位在中国福建，台湾自古属我，那时美国还未出现。可是你说台湾是美国的“切身利益”，亏你说得出口，有这个脸！不管你怎样颠倒黑白弄鬼装神，不管你是在罗得岛还是在华盛顿，为什么你的手一伸就那么长，横过太平洋直达中国海滨？
