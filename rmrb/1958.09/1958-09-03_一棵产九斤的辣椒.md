　　A Chili Pepper Plant Yielding Nine Jin
    The chili peppers harvested from a chili pepper plant grown by Liang Chenglu, a farmer in Yongjia Township, Tongliang County, Sichuan, weighed a total of nine jin after drying. This chili pepper plant was planted in May 1956, and has grown to more than six chi in height, with more than twenty branches, resembling a small chili pepper tree. The main reason for the high yield is that this chili pepper plant has become perennial, with many branches, early flowering, and a long fruiting period.

　　一棵产九斤的辣椒
    四川铜梁县永加乡农民梁成录种的一棵辣椒，收的辣椒晒干后共重九斤。这棵辣椒是1956年5月栽下的，已长到六尺多高，发了二十多台枝桠，像一棵小辣椒树。高产的主要原因，是这棵辣椒树变成多年生，枝桠多，开花早，结实期长。
