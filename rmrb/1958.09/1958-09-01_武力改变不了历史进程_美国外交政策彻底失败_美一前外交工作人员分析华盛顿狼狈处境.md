Xinhua News Agency, New York, 30th—The American magazine "New Republic" published an article by Louis Halle on August 18th, criticizing American foreign policy. The article admits that the American foreign policy, which delusionally attempts to dominate the world by force, has suffered a complete failure in the face of historical development.

Halle is a professor at the University of Virginia and worked in the decision-making body of the U.S. State Department before 1954.

This author, familiar with the inside story of American foreign policy, said in the article that the "failure of policy" of the United States "arises from its preconceived illusions about the world." He said, "We still retain the illusion that America is omnipotent, as if there is nothing that our country cannot do. We think that the Marines can stop the development of history."

Referring to Eisenhower's dispatch of American troops to invade Lebanon, Halle said, "Almost no one doubts that this decision will weaken the Western cause in terms of its consequences. Just like in China, we are in a situation that is getting worse and worse, and it is difficult to get rid of it." Halle admitted that the Eisenhower Doctrine has aroused "resentment" among the Arab people, who believe that "this doctrine is a threat to American imperialist penetration into the region."

Halle believes that the U.S.'s armed intervention in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries is as much a "mistake" as its armed intervention in China's internal affairs. He pointed out that Eisenhower "portrayed the situation in Lebanon as foreign aggression, but in fact, the basic situation is an internal civil war. … American action is ‘intervention in a civil war.’" He then said in a mocking tone, we "describe the Chinese Communist Party... gaining power in China through civil war as 'foreign aggression,' and our past and present support for Chiang Kai-shek does not count as interference in China's internal affairs, because China is embodied in him—according to this myth, what he opposes is not something inherently Chinese, but foreign aggression." He went on to point out that in the cases of China and Arab countries, "we have both used American troops to maintain" the "status quo." However, "between 1945 and 1949, there was nothing the United States could do to stop the historical forces that began in 1912 and completed the Chinese revolution." Halle said, "Now perhaps we are repeating this mistake in the Middle East." He admitted, "We (the United States) cannot stop the course of history by any means at our disposal."

### 武力改变不了历史进程  美国外交政策彻底失败　美一前外交工作人员分析华盛顿狼狈处境

　　武力改变不了历史进程  美国外交政策彻底失败
　　美一前外交工作人员分析华盛顿狼狈处境
    新华社30日讯　纽约消息：美国“新共和”杂志8月18日刊载了路易斯·哈耳写的一篇批评美国外交政策的文章。文章承认妄想以武力支配世界的美国外交政策在历史的发展面前已遭到彻底的失败。
    哈耳是弗吉尼亚大学的教授，1954年以前他在美国国务院的决策机构里工作。
    这个熟悉美国外交政策内情的作者在文章中说，美国外交“政策的失败”是由它“对世界所抱的既定幻想中产生出来的”。他说，“我们还残存着美国是无所不能的幻想，好像没有任何事情是我们这个国家所力所不及的。我们认为，陆战队可以制止历史的发展。”
    哈耳在谈到艾森豪威尔派遣美国军队侵入黎巴嫩时说，“几乎没有人怀疑这个决定从后果看来会削弱西方的事业。正像在中国一样，我们陷入每况愈下的境地，难以摆脱出来。”哈耳承认，艾森豪威尔主义已引起了阿拉伯人民的“愤懑”，他们认为“这个主义就是美国对这个地区进行帝国主义渗入的威胁”。
    哈耳认为美国以武力干涉中东国家内政同以武力干涉中国内政一样是“犯了错误”。他指出，艾森豪威尔“把黎巴嫩局势描画为外来的侵略，可是事实上基本情况是内部的一场内战。……美国行动就是‘干涉内战’。”他又以嘲笑口吻说，我们“把中国共产党……通过内战而得以继承中国政权说成是“外来的侵略”，我们过去和现在对于蒋介石的支持都不算是干涉中国的内政，因为中国就体现在他这个人的身上——按照这种神话，他所反对的本来就不是中国自身的东西，而是外来的侵略。”他接着指出，在中国和阿拉伯国家的情况下，“我们都使用了美国军队来保持”“现状”。但是，“在1945到1949年之间，美国没有办法能作任何事情来制止那种从1912年开始并使中国革命完成的历史势力”。哈耳说，“现在也许我们又在中东重犯这种错误”。他承认，“我们（美国）不能以我们能力所及的任何手段来制止历史的进程”。
