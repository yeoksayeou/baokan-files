    We Are Ready to Fight At Any Time
    Liu Baiyu
    I just returned from Tashkent. In that place filled with sunshine and the scent of roses, we discussed literary issues related to human peace and happiness with friends from Asian and African countries, and prepared for the upcoming Asian-African Writers' Conference. But now I cannot avoid talking about war. Because American imperialism wants to impose war upon us. We should loudly tell the world: American shells have exploded in Xiamen, and blood is flowing on Chinese soil again!
    We have never feared war; we have achieved victory through the storms of war.
    I deeply know how many traces of war still remain on our people, our comrades. We can point out which scar was made by an American bullet. If we say that how much fighting will is stored in our hearts, to be honest, how much hatred is also stored in our hearts.
    We are not people who like to talk about hatred often; we are more interested in creating peaceful undertakings. We can make our land bloom like a mythological world. Who has ever seen anything like this before: sparks of steel fill the sky, and golden grains of rice surpass the flow of the Yangtze River? But one thing, we want Eisenhower, Dulles, and their ilk to remember well! We have competed with you, and more than once, on Chinese soil, and also on Korean soil. You have all failed. You yourselves know how miserable your failures were. Are you really so forgetful? No, but your imperialist ambitions of aggression and the ignorant greed of speculators are driving you to another new adventure. So let us tell you, if the past contests were once before we were liberated, and once just after we were liberated, then now, when we have achieved a decisive victory in socialist construction, if we must fight, you will personally feel how powerful and heavy the force that strikes the aggressor will be. We are people who cherish peace and understand what is the greatest courage. We also understand what necessary tolerance is. But we must never forget in our hearts that part of our land is still being trampled by the enemy, and part of our flesh and blood is still suffering torment. Who can not be pained by this? Who can not be indignant about this? We must solemnly tell the American imperialists that liberating Taiwan and liberating Jinmen and Mazu are our sacred duties. The tolerance of the Chinese people is limited. The fire of righteous indignation is burning fiercely in the hearts of 600 million people. If the aggressor does not stop his criminal activities, we will give him a merciless blow!
    Even in Tashkent, we waited late into the night in front of the radio. We heard the earth-shaking roar of the people's justice coming from hundreds of miles away. We knew this was the call of the motherland. At that time, I thought of the comrades who had fought together. I understood how everyone's heart should be filled with boiling blood in the face of this grim reality. Yes, dear comrades! We have fought before, but if the signal is given, let us immediately go to the front line and wage a new battle for the peace of the motherland, for the honor of the motherland, and for the liberation of all the land of the motherland! We once presented a fiery sun from the ruins of disaster and the wilderness of thorns. We have created this new era of peace with our own hands in battle. Therefore, when someone wants to destroy this new era, we have the most right to fight with our own lives to defend this era of peace. In any case, the torch of peace will not be extinguished by wind and rain, but will only be raised higher and higher and burn brighter and brighter in the battle. The people of Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan are all waiting for the liberation and salvation of their motherland. A handful of soil cannot resist the torrent. The immense power of 600 million people can never be blocked by the lies and slanders of the Dulles clique. Today, Foreign Minister Chen Yi issued a statement that the United States armed forces must withdraw from the Taiwan area, and at the same time issued the eighth serious warning against the intrusion of US warships and aircraft into our territorial waters, inland seas, and airspace. At this time, we are raising our vigilance, our eyes are bright, and the 600 million people have only one common vow in their hearts, which is: We are ready to fight at any time. (September 21)

    我们随时准备战斗
    刘白羽
    我刚从塔什干回来。我们在那充满阳光与玫瑰花香味的地方，和来自亚洲非洲的国家的朋友，商谈着对人类和平与幸福有关的文学问题，筹备即将召开的亚非作家会议。但是现在我不能不谈到战争。因为美帝国主义要把战争强加在我们头上。我们应当大声地告诉全世界：美国炮弹在厦门爆炸，血又流在中国的土地上了！
    我们从来不惧怕战争，我们是穿过战争的暴风雨而取得胜利的。
    我深深知道，在我们的人民，我们的同志的身上，还留着多少战争的痕迹。我们指得出，那一块伤疤是美国子弹打出来的。如果说我们心中积蓄着多少战斗的意志，老实说我们心中还积蓄着多少仇恨。
    我们不是愿意常常谈仇恨的人，我们更大的兴趣是创造和平事业。我们能够使我们的大地像神话世界般开得万花灿烂，谁曾见过像现今这样：钢铁的火花织满天空，金黄的稻粒超过长江流水？但是有一点，我们要艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之流好好记住！我们和你们较量过，而且不只一次，在中国的土地上，也在朝鲜的土地上较量过，你们都失败了，你们自己心里明白，你们失败得有多么惨重。难道你们真是那么健忘吗？不会，不过你们帝国主义侵略的野心和投机商愚昧的贪心，驱使你们又来个新的冒险了，这样就让我们告诉你们，如果说过去的较量，一次是在我们尚未获得解放之前，一次是在刚刚获得解放之后，那么，现在当我们取得社会主义建设决定性的胜利的时候，假如必须战斗，你们能以亲身感受到予侵略者以打击的力量将会多么强大，多么沉重。我们是珍爱和平的人，懂得什么是最大的勇敢。也懂得什么是必须的容忍。不过我们心中时刻不能忘记，一部分土地还受着敌人蹂躏，一部分骨肉还受着痛苦的熬煎，谁能不为这痛心？谁能不为这愤慨？我们必需严正地告诉美帝国主义者，解放台湾、解放金门和马祖是我们的神圣职责。中国人民的容忍是有限度的。正义的愤怒之火已在六亿人民心中熊熊燃烧，侵略者如若还不停止他的罪恶活动，我们必将给以无情的打击！
    还是在塔什干时，我们深夜守候在收音机前。我们听到撼天震地的人民的正义吼声，从千百里外传来。我们知道这是祖国的召唤。那时我想到一起战斗过的同志们。我明了面对这严峻的现实，每一个人心中该是怎样热血沸腾。是的，亲爱的同志们！我们战斗过了，但如若信号亮了，就让我们立刻走上前线，为祖国的和平，为祖国的荣誉，为祖国全部土地的解放，进行新的战斗吧！我们曾经从灾难的废墟与荆棘的荒原中捧献出一轮火热的太阳。我们用双手在战斗中创造了这一个新的和平时代。因此当一旦有人要来破坏、毁灭这个新时代时，我们就最有权利用自己生命为保卫这和平时代而进行战斗。不论怎样，和平的火炬是不会被风雨所熄灭，而只会在战斗中愈举愈高，在战斗中愈燃愈亮。金门、马祖、台湾的人民都在等待着自己祖国的解放与拯救。一撮土是抵挡不住洪流的。巨大的六亿人民的力量，决不是杜勒斯之流的谎言与诬蔑所能阻挡。今天，陈毅外长发表了美国武装力量必须撤出台湾地区的声明，同时对美舰美机再次侵入我领海、内海和领空发出第八次严重的警告。在这时候，我们提高警惕，我们的眼睛雪亮，我们六亿人民心中只有一个共同的誓言，这就是：我们随时准备战斗。　　（9月21日）
