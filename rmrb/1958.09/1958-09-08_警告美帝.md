　　Warning to the American Empire
  　Tao Dun
　　American imperialists, open your eyes,
　　Don't treat China like it was before,
　　If you want to play with cannons, then play with cannons,
　　If you want to sail ships, then sail ships.
　　Ever since the Communist Party came to lead,
　　A giant has raised a great iron fist.
　　Whoever dares to come and touch it,
　　Is guaranteed to get a bruised nose, swollen eyes,
　  A broken head, hemorrhaging, broken legs,
　  And be crippled all over!
　　If you don't believe what I'm saying,
　　Take a look at China's construction these nine years.
　　These nine years are not simple,
　　Nine years surpassing five thousand years.
　　The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production,
　　The people's commune movement is right now.
　　Steel, grain, and cotton,
　　Have doubled again and again.
　  The nation's youth are all soldiers,
　　Organized into squads, platoons, companies, and regiments.
　　The People's Liberation Army guards the front lines of national defense,
　　Preparing to resolutely, thoroughly,
    Cleanly, and completely wipe out the enemy.
　　These forces are not all,
　　There's also the powerful Soviet Union, our fraternal ally.
　　American imperialists, don't be forgetful,
　　Think about the defeat in Korea, just five years ago.
    Just one step over the "38th parallel,"
　　One hundred and forty thousand American troops were completely finished.
　　The Taiwan Strait is just like the Shangganling,
　　We've prepared your graves completely.
　　If you dare to provoke again,
　　Death is right in front of you!

　　警告美帝
  　陶钝
　　美帝国主义睁开眼，
　　别拿中国当从前，
　　爱弄大炮就弄炮，
　　爱开轮船就开轮船。
　　自从共产党来领导，
　　巨人竖起了大铁拳。
　　谁敢上来碰一碰，
　　管保打你个鼻青、眼肿、
　  头破血流、腰断、腿折，
　  浑身上下都伤残！
　　我说这话你不信，
　　看一看中国建设这九年。
　　这九年，不简单，
　　九年胜过五千年。
　　工农业生产大跃进，
　　公社运动正当前。
　　钢铁、粮食和棉花，
　　翻了一番又一番。
　  全国青壮年都是兵，
　　编班、编队、编营又编团。
　　解放军把守在国防前线，
　　准备着把敌人坚决、彻底、
    干净、全部消灭完。
　　这些力量还不算，
　　还有那同盟兄弟强大的苏联。
　　美帝国主义不健忘，
　　想一想朝鲜败仗才五年。
    “三八线”刚刚越了一步，
　　十四万美军全玩完。
　　台湾海峡好比上甘岭，
　　坟墓都给你准备全。
　　你若胆敢再挑衅，
　　死神就在你面前！
