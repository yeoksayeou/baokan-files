The 4,650 mu of barren hills in Ma'ou Agricultural Cooperative, Changgang Township, Fengchuan County, Guangdong Province, have been transformed into a fruit and flower mountain through the efforts of all cooperative members. The cooperative has planted more than thirty varieties of fruits, including Chinese chestnuts, Yeesum pears, plums, and peaches, adding to the more than 10,000 old fruit trees already there, for a total of more than 40,000 fruit trees of various kinds. Now the barren hills surrounding the agricultural cooperative have become a beautiful fruit and flower mountain. Here, flowers fall in profusion all year round, with vibrant colors and abundant fresh fruits, pleasing everyone who sees them. Local farmers use the following lyrics to praise this newly formed fruit-producing region: "Plums turn yellow in March, plums in April, peaches turn red in May, pears in June, wampee and bananas ripen in July, chestnuts fall all over the ground in August, sugar pears are just in season in September, eat sugar pears and then pick persimmons, grandfathers present big pomelos in October, and mandarin and tangerine branches are weighed down in November and December."

    荒山变成了花果山
    广东封川县长岗乡马欧社的四千六百五十亩荒山经过全体社员的努力经营，已变成了花果山。全社已种下风栗、夜深梨、梅桃等共三十多种，连原有的一万多株老果树在内，共有各种果树四万多株。现在农业社周围的荒山已变成了美丽的花果山。这里一年四季到处是落英缤纷，万紫千红，鲜果累累，人人见了喜爱。当地农民用“三月梅黄四月李，五月桃红六月梨，七月黄皮香蕉熟，八月栗子落满地，九月糖梨正当时，吃了糖梨又摘柿，十月公孙捧大柚，十一、二月柑桔坠断枝”的歌词来赞美这个新成的水果之乡。
