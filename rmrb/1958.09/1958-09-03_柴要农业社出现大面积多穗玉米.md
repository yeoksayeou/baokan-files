　　Large Area of Multi-Ear Corn Appears in Chaiyao Agricultural Cooperative

　　The Chaiyao Agricultural Cooperative in Cheng'an County, Hebei Province, discovered 78 mu of multi-ear corn, including 40 mu of Er Ma Ya corn, with more than 90% of the plants having multiple ears, generally five to seven ears, and the most having up to nine ears. Some of the ears are now as long as 2.1 chi (approximately 0.7 meters). In addition, there are 38 mu of Xiao Huang corn, with 60% of the plants having multiple ears, generally four to five ears, and the most reaching seven ears. In order to make these multi-ear corn grow better, the cooperative chairman, Wang Xize, led 21 cooperative members to be specifically responsible for management. They decided to apply fertilizer three more times, totaling 1,000 jin of manure per mu, two carts of coarse fertilizer, 50 jin of cake fertilizer, and 30 jin of chemical fertilizer, with artificial pollination four to seven times. According to the cooperative's veteran farmers at a symposium, as long as intensive farming and careful management are carried out, it is guaranteed that Er Ma Ya corn will produce more than 20,000 jin per mu, and Xiao Huang corn will produce more than 10,000 jin.

　　柴要农业社出现大面积多穗玉米
    河北省成安县柴要农业社发现有七十八亩多穗玉米，其中二马牙四十亩，90％以上的株是多穗，一般有穗五到七个，最多的达九个穗。现在有的穗长达二点一尺。另有小黄玉米三十八亩，有60％的株是多穗，一般穗达四、五个，最多的达到七个穗，该社为使这些多穗玉米长的更好，社长王希泽带领二十一名社员专门负责管理。他们决定再追肥三次，计每亩大粪一千斤、粗肥二车、饼肥五十斤、化肥三十斤，人工授粉四到七次。据该社老农座谈会上估计，只要进行精耕细作加强管理，二马牙玉米每亩产二万斤以上，小黄玉米产万斤以上是有保证的。　张清河
