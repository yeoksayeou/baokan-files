Soil – A Factory for Green Plants
Gao Shiqi

The leap in rice yield to over 50,000 catties per mu is something our predecessors could never have dreamed of. If a celebration were to be held, the soil should receive special praise.

However, in the minds of most people, soil has not received the attention it deserves. Some people think that soil is just dirty mud, a lifeless thing lying still under our feet, associated with all kinds of decaying matter.

This underestimation of soil is linked to a disregard for labor. This is a great slander against the soil.

In the eyes of us, the working people, soil is the best friend of crops. To make crops grow well and to produce more grain, we must put more effort into the soil.

We must understand that soil, like sunlight, air, and water, is a source of life. "All things grow from the soil," is an old Chinese saying. The Soviet writer Il'in also called the soil a "strange warehouse."

Indeed, soil is a production expert, and its contribution to human life is enormous. Our clothing, food, housing, transportation, and other necessities of life all depend on it. It provides us with grain, cotton, vegetables, fruits, feed, timber, and industrial raw materials.

Frankly speaking, without soil we cannot survive.

Therefore, we must get to know the soil well, understand it, and cherish it.

Soil is a factory for manufacturing green plants, and it is responsible for most of the life of plants; it is the supplier of water and nutrients for plants.

Pure mud, soil without water and nutrients, cannot be called soil. The concept of soil is inseparable from its fertility.

Fertility is the ability to grow plants, that is, water and nutrients. These water and nutrients are absorbed by the root system of plants, and through the photosynthesis of chlorophyll, under the sunlight, they combine with carbon dioxide in the air to become the organic matter of plants.

Mud that can grow plants is called soil. This is the scientific definition of soil given by the great Soviet soil scientist Williams. He said: "When we talk about soil, we should understand it as the loose surface layer of land on earth, the surface layer that can grow plants."

Fertility is a characteristic of soil, and it constantly changes with changing environmental conditions.

Some soils are fertile, and some are barren.

Fertile soil is a guarantee of a good harvest; barren soil brings us the misfortune of a lean year.

Once the soil loses its fertility and cannot grow plants, it becomes worthless mud and is no longer soil.

Soil is a large laboratory, a large factory, and a large battlefield. Here, physical, chemical, and biological changes are constantly taking place; here, destruction and construction are carried out day and night; here, there is also a struggle between life and death, a great battle between living and non-living things, and the situation is very intense and exciting.

Among the ranks participating in the battle are mineral troops, such as various inorganic salts; plant troops, such as withered grass and fallen leaves, and the roots of various plants; animal troops, such as ants, earthworms, and various insects, as well as rotting corpses; microbial troops, such as protozoa, algae, fungi, actinomycetes, and the famous bacteria. In addition, there are water troops and air troops. Therefore, some people say: "Soil is the unity of dead nature and living nature." This sentence is very true.

Since mankind entered this great battlefield, man has become the master who determines the fate of the soil.

Mankind conducts a series of planned battles against the soil, such as cultivation, irrigation, fertilization, and rational crop rotation. Thus, the soil begins to serve agricultural production and cannot but listen to human commands and obey human will. In this way, the soil becomes the product of human labor, benefiting mankind.

    土壤——绿色植物的工厂
    高士其
    水稻亩产跃进到五万多斤了，这是前人所梦想不到的事。如果举行一次庆功大会的话，土壤应该受到特别的表扬。
    但是，在一般人的心目中，土壤却没有受到应有的重视。有些人认为：土壤就是肮脏的泥土，它是死气沉沉的东西，静伏在我们的脚下不动，并且和一切腐败的物质同流合污。
    这种轻视土壤的思想，是和轻视劳动的心情联在一起的。这是对于土壤极大的诬蔑。
    在我们劳动人民的眼光里，土壤是庄稼最好的朋友。要使庄稼长得好，要多打粮食，就得在土壤身上多下点工夫。
    要知道，土壤和阳光、空气、水一样，都是生命的源泉。“万物土中生”，这是我国一句老话。苏联作家伊林，也曾把土壤叫做“奇异的仓库”。
    不错，土壤的确是生产的能手，它对于人类生活的贡献非常大。我们的衣、食、住、行和其他生活资料都靠它供应。它给我们生产粮食、棉花、蔬菜、水果、饲料、木材和工业原料。
    老实说，没有土壤我们就不能生存。
    因此，我们要很好的去认识土壤，了解它，爱护它。
    土壤是制造绿色植物的工厂，它对于植物的生活负有大部分的责任，它是植物水分和养料的供应者。
    纯粹的泥土，没有水分和养料的泥土，不能叫做土壤。土壤这个概念，是和它的肥力分不开的。
    肥力就是生长植物的能力，就是水分和养料。这些水分和养料，被植物的根系吸取，通过叶绿素的光合作用，在阳光照耀之下，它们会同空气中的二氧化碳，变成植物的有机质。
    能生长植物的泥土，就叫做土壤。这是苏联伟大的土壤学家威廉士给土壤所下的科学定义。他说：“当我们谈到土壤时，应该把它理解为地球上陆地的松软表面地层，能够生长植物的表层。”
    肥沃性是土壤的特点，它随着环境条件的改变经常不断地发生着变化。
    有的土壤肥沃，有的土壤贫瘠。
    肥沃的土壤是丰收的保证；贫瘠的土壤给我们带来不幸的歉年。
    土壤一旦失去肥力，不能生长植物，就变成毫无价值的泥土而不再是土壤了。
    土壤是大试验室、大工厂、大战场。在这儿，经常不断地进行着物理、化学和生物学的变化；在这儿，昼夜不息地进行着破坏和建设两大工程；在这儿，也进行着生和死的搏斗、生物和非生物的大混战，情况非常热烈而紧张。
    在参加作战的行列中，有矿物部队，如各种无机盐；有植物部队，如枯草和落叶，和各种植物的根；有动物部队，如蚂蚁、蚯蚓和各种昆虫以及腐烂的尸体；有微生物部队，如原虫、藻类、真菌，放线菌和鼎鼎大名的细菌等。此外，还有水的部队和空气部队。所以有人说：“土壤是死自然和活自然的统一体”。这句话顶不错。
    自从人类进入这个大战场之后，人就变成决定土壤命运的主人。
    人类向土壤进行一系列的、有计划的战斗，例如耕作、灌溉、施肥和合理轮作等。于是，土壤开始为农业生产服务，不能不听人的指挥，服从人的意志了。这样，土壤就变成了人类劳动的产物，为人类造福。
