According to the Hebei Daily, the Tang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province, while leading the whole Party and all the people in the great iron and steel making movement, emphasized that measures must be implemented and plans must be grounded. It made comprehensive and specific arrangements and adopted concrete measures to ensure the completion of the September and full-year pig iron tasks.

On the basis of overfulfilling the August task, the Tang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a smelting "flying meeting" on September 3, attended by the first secretaries of the Party committees of various townships, the secretaries in charge of industry, and the heads of relevant departments. The meeting made a comprehensive analysis and study of how to complete a pig iron task that was twenty-nine times greater than that of August in September. Everyone believed that the September task was very heavy, and one could not be satisfied with the soaring enthusiasm of the masses. Concrete measures must be taken to ensure every ounce of pig iron, and the plan must be completed on a daily and ten-day basis to ensure the completion of the September and full-year production tasks. The meeting proposed specific measures to ensure the completion of 900 tons of iron in September and strive to complete 1,044 tons of iron.

The meeting believed that to complete 900 tons of iron in September, relying solely on the original 76 indigenous blast furnaces would not work, and the speed of furnace construction must be accelerated. The county party committee decided to reasonably organize construction using the method of division of labor and contracted responsibility, and put forward the mobilization slogan of "Build furnaces without stopping for a second, and refine iron as soon as possible" to the furnace construction workers. Because the furnace construction task was specific and someone was responsible for each furnace, 17 indigenous blast furnaces were completed in just three days from the 4th to the 6th, and 18 more were under intense construction.

The meeting also decided to seize the opportunity to organize the normal production of the indigenous blast furnaces that had already been put into production, and then achieve large-scale high yield. This is the central link in completing the pig iron task. The specific measures adopted by the meeting were: (1) Organize 560 people from various townships to go to the Gaochang Township and Dongzhuangwan Iron and Steel Plant, where production is normal, for on-site practice to master the technology of normal production; (2) Extract 20 workers with higher technical skills from the normally producing furnaces in various townships to form an iron-making technical guidance group to conduct roving guidance on furnace technology, so that each furnace has at least five more skilled technicians; (3) Units that are building furnaces should extract a certain number of key members to participate in iron-making training classes to ensure that one is built and one is opened, with at least 800 jin of iron produced per furnace per day.

As blast furnaces are continuously built and put into production and the furnaces put into production gradually normalize production, 93,000 tons of ore must be mined in September to meet the needs of ironmaking. The county increased the mining team from 2,926 people to 10,380 people, divided them into six mining brigades, with a member of the county party committee as the captain, eating and living with the masses, and carrying out round-the-clock blitzes. In order to find out iron ore resources and mine more rich ore, they also organized 22 technicians led by the deputy secretary of the county party committee to go to the mountains to investigate mines. On September 4, 3,443 tons of ore were mined, an increase of 73 tons compared with the past.

The construction of furnaces requires a lot of materials, and timely transportation of these materials to the required locations is important for completing the ironmaking production task. The county specially established a transportation command, drawing 489 large carts and 28 cars from all sides to carry out non-stop transportation day and night. In addition, specific arrangements were also made for the production of refractory bricks, coke, and other materials.

In implementing the above measures, the county conscientiously implemented the methods of putting politics in command, emancipating the mind, using the abstract to lead the concrete, and relying on the masses, and firmly grasped the link of strengthening organizational leadership to enrich the leadership of the steel front. At present, in addition to Wang Guiji, the first secretary of the county party committee, personally going to the front line to comprehensively command the battle, two county party committee secretaries, seven county party committee members, and 227 cadres have also been drawn to take charge of furnace construction, mining, ironmaking, transportation, and material supply, and red flag competitions have been launched on various fronts, with inspections and evaluations every ten days; each indigenous blast furnace is calculated to produce 800 jin of iron per day, and those who exceed the target will be rewarded, and those who fail to complete the task will check the reasons and improve them. Now the whole county has formed a combat situation of launching a full-scale attack on steel.

### 逐项细安排　斤斤有着落  唐县把产铁计划建筑在具体措施的基础上

    逐项细安排　斤斤有着落
    唐县把产铁计划建筑在具体措施的基础上
    据河北日报报道　中共河北省唐县县委在领导全党全民大炼钢铁的运动中，强调了措施要落实、计划要落地，对保证完成9月份和全年生铁任务作了全面具体的安排，采取了具体措施。
    中共唐县县委在超额完成8月份任务的基础上，9月3日召开了各乡党委第一书记、管工业的书记、各有关部门负责人参加的冶炼飞行会议，对9月份如何完成比8月份多二十九倍的生铁任务作了全面的分析和研究。大家认为9月份任务很重，不能满足于群众的冲天干劲，必须使斤两生铁都有具体措施作保证，按日、按旬地完成计划，才能保证完成9月份和全年的生产任务。会议提出了保证完成9月份九百吨铁、力争完成一千零四十四吨铁的具体措施。
    会议认为，9月份完成九百吨铁，单靠原有的七十六个土高炉是不行的，必须加快建炉速度。县委决定用分工包干的办法合理组织施工，并向建炉工人提出了“分秒不停把炉建，尽早开炉把铁炼”的动员口号。由于建炉任务具体，炉炉有人负责，仅4至6日三天内就建成土高炉十七座，正在紧张施工的还有十八座。
    会议还决定要抓紧组织已投入生产的土高炉正常生产，进而达到大面积丰产，这是完成生铁任务的中心一环。会议采取的具体办法是：（一）组织各乡五百六十人到正常生产的高昌乡、东庄湾炼铁厂现场实习，掌握正常生产的技术；（二）从各乡正常生产的炉子上抽出二十名技术较高的工人，组成炼铁技术指导团，巡回串炉辅导技术，达到每个炉最少有五名较熟练的技术工人。（三）正在建炉的单位要抽出一定骨干参加炼铁训练班，以保证建成一个开一个，起码每炉每天出铁八百斤。
    随着高炉不断建成投入生产和投入生产的炉子逐步生产正常，必须在9月份采出矿石九万三千吨，才能满足炼铁需要。这个县把采矿队伍由二千九百二十六人增加到一万零三百八十人，划分为六个采矿大队，由县委委员任队长，同群众一起食宿，昼夜突击。为查清铁矿资源，多采富矿石，他们还组织了二十二名有技术的人员由县委副书记带领上山查矿。9月4日采矿三千四百四十三吨，比过去增加七十三吨。
    建炉需要很多物料，及时把这些物料运到需要的地点，对于完成炼铁生产任务有重要的作用。这个县专门成立了交通运输指挥部，从各方面抽调了四百八十九辆大车，二十八辆汽车，昼夜不停地进行运输。另外，对生产耐火砖、焦炭等材料也作了具体安排。
    这个县在实现以上措施中，认真贯彻了政治挂帅、解放思想、以虚带实、依靠群众的方法，并且紧紧抓住了加强组织领导充实钢铁战线领导力量这一环。目前，除县委第一书记王桂冀亲赴前线全面指挥战斗外，还抽出了两名县委书记、七名县委委员、二百二十七名干部，分工包干负责建炉、采矿、炼铁、运输、物资供应等工作，并在各个战线上展开了插红旗竞赛，每十天进行一次检查评比；每个土高炉每天按出铁八百斤计算，超过者受奖励，完不成者检查原因加以改进。现在全县已经形成了向钢铁全面出击的战斗形势。
