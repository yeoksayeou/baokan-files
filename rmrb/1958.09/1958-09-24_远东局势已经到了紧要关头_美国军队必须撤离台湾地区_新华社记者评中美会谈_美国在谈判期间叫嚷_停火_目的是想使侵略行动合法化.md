Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 22nd: Our reporter reports: The Far East situation has reached a critical juncture today. Since the Warsaw talks resumed last week, the Chinese and American ambassadors have held talks here for the third time.

World public opinion places great hope in the talks between the Chinese and American ambassadors. It is hoped that they can find a way to ease the tense situation in the Far East caused by the blatant US military aggression. However, all indications show that the United States is using the Warsaw talks as a cover to step up its preparations for war against China, and as a means to force a so-called "ceasefire." The purpose of this "ceasefire" is to restrain China, preventing it from exercising sovereignty over its own territory, while allowing the United States to continue its military occupation of Taiwan at will, and even expand its aggression to China's inland sea islands.

According to many Western newspapers, US representative Beam demanded an immediate "ceasefire" at the Warsaw talks as the main condition for further negotiations. Dulles is peddling his infamous "ceasefire" proposal everywhere at the United Nations and elsewhere, while refusing to consider truly important issues in easing tensions, such as the withdrawal of all US troops from the Taiwan area.

At the very beginning of the Warsaw talks, Dulles immediately threatened to bypass the talks and submit the issue to the United Nations, where he believed he could rally his group of cronies to support his proposal, which is nominally a "ceasefire" but actually allows the United States to continue setting fires.

When the United States discovered that its "ceasefire" proposal was becoming increasingly unpopular even among its allies, it put various pressures on them. The US government said it was prepared to issue a so-called new policy statement this week to coerce its allies to support its position. Eisenhower also met with British Foreign Secretary Lloyd yesterday, attempting to gain the support of this "little brother." Eisenhower will also meet with the foreign ministers of various South American countries at a luncheon tomorrow. This series of activities is clearly aimed at gaining more support in order to put pressure on the current Warsaw talks and finally submit the issue to the United Nations.

A Reuters report from Washington revealed some of the US motives for the Warsaw talks. He quoted US State Department officials as saying: "The immediate purpose of the United States in the Warsaw talks is to obtain a guarantee from China to stop shelling Jinmen. Once a ceasefire agreement is reached, the United States will ask the Chinese Communists to abandon their claim to Formosa (Taiwan) by force."

It can be seen from this telegram how the United States wants to gradually use the "ceasefire" to force China to give up its sacred right to liberate its own territory, while the United States clearly does not intend to give up its aggressive intentions. While engaging in diplomatic conspiracies, the United States has also provided the Kuomintang with 90 million US dollars in military aid in the past three weeks. The US government, despite repeated warnings from the Chinese government, has repeatedly sent warships and military aircraft to violate China's territorial waters and airspace. American newspapers have also repeatedly declared that the United States is determined to defend Jinmen for Chiang Kai-shek at all costs.

Diplomatic observers here believe that the US "ceasefire" proposal is utterly absurd. It attempts to legalize the US occupation of Taiwan and further expand its aggression to China's coast, thereby making the situation in the Far East permanently tense. They believe that the fundamental measure to eliminate tensions in the Far East is, as Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi suggested, to withdraw all US troops from the Taiwan area.

    远东局势已经到了紧要关头  美国军队必须撤离台湾地区
    新华社记者评中美会谈
    美国在谈判期间叫嚷“停火”  目的是想使侵略行动合法化
    新华社华沙22日电　本社记者报道：远东局势今天到达紧要关头，自从华沙会谈上星期复会以来，中美两国大使已经第三次在这里举行会谈。
    世界舆论对中美大使的会谈寄予很大的希望。希望他们能够找到办法来缓和由于美国赤裸裸的军事侵略所造成的远东紧张局势。但是，一切迹象表明，美国正在利用华沙会谈作为掩护来加紧对中国的备战，并且作为强使实行所谓“停火”的手段。这样“停火”的目的在于约束中国，使它不能在自己的领土上行使主权，而使美国能够随意对台湾继续进行军事占领，甚至把它的侵略扩大到中国内海岛屿。
    据许多西方报纸报道，美国代表比姆在华沙会谈上要求以立即“停火”作为进一步谈判的主要条件。杜勒斯在联合国和其他地方到处兜售他的臭名远扬的“停火”建议，同时拒绝考虑消除紧张局势方面的真正重大问题，即使所有美军撤离台湾地区。
    在华沙会谈刚开始的时候，杜勒斯马上扬言要绕过会谈，把问题提交联合国，他认为他可以在那里纠合他的一群小伙伴支持他的名义上是“停火”而实质上是容许美国继续放火的建议。
    美国在发现它的“停火”建议甚至在它的盟国中也日益不得人心的时候，便对它们施加种种压力。美国政府说，它准备在本周发表所谓新的政策声明来胁迫它的盟国支持它的立场。艾森豪威尔昨天还接见了英国外交大臣劳埃德，企图取得这位“小兄弟”的支持。艾森豪威尔还将在明天午宴时同南美各国外长会谈。这一连串的活动显然是为了取得更多的支持，以便对目前的华沙会谈施加压力，最后再把问题提交联合国。
    路透社记者发自华盛顿的报道透露了美国对华沙会谈的一些动机。他引用美国国务院人士的话说：“美国在华沙会谈上的直接目的是要取得中国停止炮轰金门的保证，一旦达成停火协议后，美国将要求中国共产党人放弃以武力达到对福摩萨（台湾）的要求”。
    从这则电讯中可以看出，美国如何想逐步利用“停火”来迫使中国放弃解放自己领土的神圣权利，而美国显然并不打算放弃它的侵略意图。美国在进行外交阴谋的同时，又在过去三周中向国民党提供了九千万美元的军事援助。美国政府不顾中国政府的多次警告派遣军舰和军用飞机一再侵犯中国领海和领空。美国报纸并且多次扬言，美国决心不惜一切代价来为蒋介石保卫金门。
    这里的外交观察家认为，美国的“停火”建议荒谬绝顶，它企图使美国侵占台湾合法化并进一步把侵略扩大到中国的海岸，从而使远东的局势永远紧张。他们认为，消除远东紧张局势的根本措施是像中国外长陈毅所建议的那样，使所有美军撤离台湾地区。
