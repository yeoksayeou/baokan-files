Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 31st: Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" and "Ta Kung Pao" published commentaries today refuting a statement made on the 29th by the Hong Kong Chief Secretary, which attempted to shirk responsibility. "Wen Wei Po's" commentary said: "This statement very clearly shows people that the Hong Kong British authorities not only have no intention of repenting, but also have made provocative slanders against the protests of the broad masses of residents and Chinese newspapers." The commentary said: "The Chief Secretary arrogantly maliciously called the correct reports by Chinese newspapers on the atrocities of the British police 'distortions of facts,' 'fallacies,' and 'inflammatory.' May we ask, were those photos 'distorted' facts by the reporters?" The commentary concluded: "All Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon are watching the Hong Kong British authorities to see when they will stop their policy of following the United States in being hostile to China."

"Ta Kung Pao's" commentary said: "When the Hong Kong British authorities closed the Chung Wah Middle School, they beat the school's teachers and students and reporters covering the scene. These facts have been seen in reports and photos in various newspapers. Facts are the best witnesses. Those photos are the best evidence. It is futile for the Hong Kong British Chief Secretary to try to evade responsibility."

　　香港英当局狡赖毫无用处
    香港“文汇报”“大公报”斥责英当局新挑衅
    据新华社香港31日电　香港“文汇报”和“大公报”今日发表评论驳斥香港布政司29日发表的企图推卸罪责的声明。“文汇报”的评论说：“这个声明十分明显的让人们看到，香港英国当局不仅毫无悔改之意，而且还对广大居民的抗议和中国报纸作了挑衅性的污蔑”。评论说：“布政司狂妄地把中国报纸对英国警察的暴行的正确报道，恶意地称为‘歪曲事实’、‘谬误’及‘有煽动性’。请问那些照片是记者们‘歪曲’出来的事实吗？”评论最后说：“全港九职工中国同胞都在注视着香港英国当局，看它在什么时候停止其追随美国敌视中国的政策。”
    “大公报”的评论说：“香港英国当局在封闭中华中学校舍时，殴打了该校师生和在场采访的记者，这些事实已见诸各报的报道及照片中。事实是最好的证人。那些照片是最好的证物。香港英国布政司想狡赖是徒劳无益的。”
