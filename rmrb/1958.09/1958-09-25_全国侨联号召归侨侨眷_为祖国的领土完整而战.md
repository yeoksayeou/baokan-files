Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese issued a statement today, firmly supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, and calling on returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and the people of the whole country to fight to defend the motherland and resist aggression!

The statement said that Dulles' shameless clamoring and war threats at the United Nations General Assembly once again demonstrate that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and peace-loving people of the world.

The statement pointed out: U.S. imperialism is constantly increasing its troops in the Taiwan Strait area, and U.S. planes and warships are constantly violating our territorial waters and airspace, seriously undermining our sovereignty and threatening the safety of the hometowns of overseas Chinese. This behavior of U.S. imperialism playing with fire on the brink of war, and all kinds of rampant acts of hegemonism, have made the Chinese people unable to tolerate it. Taiwan has been China's territory since ancient times, and Jinmen and Matsu are even more part of our Fujian Province. The Chinese people must liberate Jinmen and Matsu, and must liberate Taiwan. This is our country's internal affair and does not allow the United States to interfere. The U.S. military must immediately get out of the Taiwan Strait area.

The statement concluded by saying that the Chinese people love peace, but are never afraid of war. If U.S. imperialism dares to impose war on us, the more than ten million returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students, who have a fine tradition of anti-imperialism and patriotism, will resolutely unite with the 600 million people of the whole country, spare no sacrifice, and be ready at all times to listen to the call of the motherland, fight to defend the motherland and resist aggression, fight to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, and fight to defend peace in the Far East and the world!

    全国侨联号召归侨侨眷
    为祖国的领土完整而战
    新华社23日讯  中华全国归国华侨联合会今天发表声明，坚决拥护陈毅外长的声明，并号召归侨、侨眷和全国人民一道，为保卫祖国反抗侵略而战！
    声明说，杜勒斯在联合国大会上的无耻叫嚣和战争恐吓，再次说明美帝国主义是中国人民和世界爱好和平人民的死敌。
    声明指出：美帝国主义不断向台湾海峡地区增兵，美机美舰不断侵犯我国领海领空，严重破坏我国主权，也威胁到华侨家乡的安全。美帝国主义这种在战争边缘玩火的行为，和种种的横行霸道，使中国人民忍无可忍。台湾自古以来就是中国的领土，金门、马祖更是我国福建省的一部分，中国人民一定要解放金门、马祖，一定要解放台湾，这是我国的内政问题，不容许美国干涉。美国军队必须立即从台湾海峡地区滚出去。
    声明最后说，中国人民爱好和平，但决不怕战争，如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，素有反帝爱国优良传统的一千多万归国华侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生坚决同全国六亿人民一道，不惜任何牺牲，时刻准备着听候祖国的召唤，为保卫祖国反抗侵略而战，为维护祖国的主权和领土完整而战！为保卫远东和世界和平而战！
