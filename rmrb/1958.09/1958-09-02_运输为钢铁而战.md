	Transportation Battles for Steel

Striving to produce 10.7 million tons of steel is a glorious task for the entire Party and all the people, requiring cooperation from all aspects. Transportation is one of the important aspects.

Large-scale iron and steel enterprises need the transportation department to deliver raw materials and fuels such as ore and coal to the furnace in a timely manner. This is something everyone can understand. However, the production of small blast furnaces and indigenous blast furnaces also requires a large amount of transport capacity to ensure the supply of raw materials and fuel. I am afraid that some comrades are not very clear about this. According to statistics from some places in Jiangxi Province, a 14-cubic-meter small blast furnace requires 470 people, of which nearly 300 are engaged in transportation. Just imagine: If we extrapolate according to this ratio, how many people will be needed to engage in transportation for the hundreds of thousands of indigenous blast furnaces across the country!

The current situation is that trunk line transportation is strained, and non-trunk line transportation is also strained. Under these strained circumstances, how to ensure that the iron and steel industry is not "cut off" from supplies, ensure the smooth flow of molten iron from large and small blast furnaces, and ensure that the plan to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year is fully realized, requires Party committees and transportation departments in various regions to quickly take effective measures to give priority to solving the transportation problems of the iron and steel industry.

    运输为钢铁而战
    为生产一千零七十万吨钢而奋斗，是一个全党全民的光荣任务，需要各方面协作配合。交通运输就是其中的一个重要方面。
    大型钢铁企业需要交通运输部门及时把矿石、煤炭等原料、燃料送到炉前。这是人人都可以理解的。然而，小高炉、土高炉的生产，也需要大量的运力，来保证原料和燃料的供应，恐怕是有些同志还不很清楚的。据江西省一些地方的统计，一座十四立方公尺的小高炉需要用四百七十人，其中有近三百人是搞运输的。试想：如果按这个比例推算，全国十几万座土高炉要用多少人去搞运输呀！
    现在的情况是干线运输紧张，非干线的运输也很紧张。在这紧张的情况下，怎样保证钢铁工业不“断饷”，保证大大小小的高炉铁水畅流，保证今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的计划如数实现，就需要各地党委和交通运输部门迅速采取有效措施，优先解决钢铁工业的运输问题。
