Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: Yesterday and today, U.S. imperialism continuously dispatched warships from the Seventh Fleet in the Taiwan Strait to escort transport ships of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, openly invading our territorial waters within 12 nautical miles of the Jinmen and Xiamen areas, undermining our sovereignty, and deliberately carrying out new military provocations against the Chinese people.

According to Western news agencies, yesterday morning, a "convoy" composed of several cruisers and destroyers of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, under the personal command of Seventh Fleet Commander Bickley, led two Chiang bandit transport ships carrying military supplies to reinforce Jinmen, crossed the Taiwan Strait, and intruded into the Chinese Jinmen and Xiamen territorial waters within 12 nautical miles at around 2 p.m. The Chiang bandit transport ships then docked at Jinmen and unloaded a large number of military supplies. After returning last night, these ships of the Seventh Fleet then led the second batch of Chiang bandit ships to Jinmen Island today, again invading our Jinmen territorial waters.

The continuous invasion of Chinese territorial waters by the U.S. Navy is a deliberate act of provocation planned in advance under the direct command of Washington. Paul Blackburn, commander of the U.S. Taiwan Strait patrol fleet, openly told reporters yesterday that U.S. naval vessels have been "authorized to disregard" the 12-nautical-mile territorial sea limit declared by the Chinese government. Blackburn also stated that the U.S. Navy has been ordered to "retaliate" when attacked while carrying out this aggressive mission. As can be seen from Western news agency reports, after Premier Zhou Enlai issued a statement sternly warning against U.S. military threats and war provocations in the Taiwan Strait area, the U.S. government immediately took such provocative actions, aiming to "test" the "intentions" of the Chinese people, and vainly attempt to rely on the intimidation of "showing strength" to achieve its goal of expanding its aggressive scope in the Taiwan Strait area to Jinmen and other coastal islands.

On the same day that U.S. warships invaded Chinese territorial waters on the 7th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made a speech in New York, arrogantly saying that the appearance of U.S. warships within the 12-nautical-mile territorial sea limit stipulated by China "will not lead to war." He also sophistically stated that China "has no right to forcibly stipulate the 12-nautical-mile territorial sea limit."

According to United Press International, U.S. officials in Taiwan admitted that the United States is deliberately playing with "the brink of war," and fantasizes about gaining advantages from it. However, the Chinese people will not ignore the deliberate U.S. invasion. The spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued serious warnings twice yesterday and today regarding the U.S. warships' invasion of Chinese territorial waters. The U.S. authorities will bear all responsibility for their dangerous game.

### 不顾我国政府的严正警告  美国军舰连续侵犯我国领海

　　不顾我国政府的严正警告
　　美国军舰连续侵犯我国领海
    新华社8日讯　昨今两天，美帝国主义连续派遣在台湾海峡的第七舰队的军舰护送蒋介石集团的运输舰，公然侵入我国金门、厦门地区的领海十二浬以内，破坏我国主权，蓄意对中国人民进行新的军事挑衅。
    据西方通讯社报道，昨天上午，美国第七舰队的几艘巡洋舰和驱逐舰组成的一支“护航队”，在第七舰队司令比克利的亲自指挥下，带领载运军火增援金门的蒋贼运输舰两艘，越过台湾海峡，在下午两点多钟，侵入中国金门、厦门领海地区十二浬以内。蒋贼运输舰随后在金门靠岸卸下大批军火。第七舰队的这些舰只在昨晚折回后接着又在今天带领第二批蒋贼船只向金门岛进发，再次侵入我金门领海地区。
    美国海军连续侵犯中国领海，是在华盛顿直接指挥下事先策划好的蓄意挑衅的行为。美国台湾海峡巡逻舰队司令保罗·布莱克本昨天公然对记者说，美国海军舰艇已经“受权不理睬”中国政府宣布的十二浬的领海范围。布莱克本还表示，美国海军已经奉命在执行这种侵略任务而受到攻击时将“予以还击”。从西方通讯社的消息中可以看出，在周恩来总理发表声明对美国在台湾海峡地区的军事威胁和战争挑衅提出严正警告以后，美国政府紧接着采取这种挑衅行动，目的是要“试验”中国人民的“意图”，妄想依靠“显示实力”的恫吓，达到它把台湾海峡地区的侵略范围扩大到金门等沿海岛屿的目的。
    在7日美国军舰侵入中国领海的同一天，美国国务卿杜勒斯在纽约发表谈话，狂妄地说，美国军舰出现在中国规定的十二浬领海界限以内“不会导致战争”。他并且强词夺理地表示，中国“没有权利强制规定十二浬的领海界限”。
    据合众国际社消息，在台湾的美国官员承认，美国是在故意玩弄“战争边缘的手法”，并且幻想可以从中捞得便宜。但是，中国人民是不会对美国的蓄意侵犯置之不理的。中国外交部发言人已经在昨今两天就美国军舰侵犯中国领海事件两次提出严重的警告。美国当局将对它的玩火行为承担一切责任。
