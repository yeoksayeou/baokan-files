Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th – U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, at a press conference held on the 9th, sophistically defended the U.S. government's aggressive and provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait. He reiterated the hawkish stance of his September 4 statement and once again shamelessly slandered the Chinese people's struggle to liberate their own territory as "using force to acquire additional territory." One of the most frequently asked questions at the press conference was whether the U.S. government had decided to provoke a war with serious consequences in Kinmen and Matsu. In typical gangster fashion, Dulles said that Kinmen and Matsu, islands belonging to China's inland sea, were "forward positions" for the U.S. The Chinese people's liberation of their coastal islands "threatens" "the entire position of the United States and its free world allies in the Pacific - from Japan, Korea, Okinawa, Formosa (Taiwan), the Philippines, all the way to Southeast Asia," "this involves the vital interests of the United States" and "harms U.S. security," therefore the Kinmen and Matsu situation "cannot be viewed in isolation."

Dulles repeated his September 4 statement, indicating that the U.S. President "would not hesitate to make a decision" to use force to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Kinmen and Matsu. However, he said that "no final decision" has been made yet.

Dulles flatly denied that the U.S. had helped Chiang Kai-shek's troops reinforce Kinmen. He claimed that the decision to strengthen the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Kinmen and Matsu was made by the Chiang Kai-shek clique and was not "encouraged" by the United States. However, the well-known fact is that, until the day before yesterday, the U.S. aggressor troops, disregarding the Chinese government's solemn warnings, dispatched Seventh Fleet ships to escort Chiang Kai-shek's ships to provide large amounts of supplies to the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Kinmen.

Dulles stubbornly defended the provocative actions of U.S. warships continuously violating Chinese territorial waters. He insisted that the Chinese government's declaration of the width of China's territorial waters as twelve nautical miles was a regulation that the U.S. government could not agree to, and he slandered the Chinese government's decision, which was entirely in line with its own interests and purely an exercise of its own sovereignty, as an act of "plunder." A reporter asked what would happen if U.S. ships were hit by artillery fire during U.S. escort operations, given that one of Chiang Kai-shek's supply ships had already been destroyed by artillery fire. Dulles said that there could be two situations, one "accidental" and the other "intentional." If an attack on a U.S. warship was judged to be an "intentional attack," then the U.S. would "retaliate in some way."

A reporter asked, "Have you received any guarantees that if you get involved in a war with Communist China in the Taiwan Strait, allies other than the Kuomintang will support you?" Dulles could not hide the fact that the U.S. was very isolated in its aggression against Taiwan and the coastal islands. He was forced to admit that the U.S. had "not received any such guarantees."

Reporters repeatedly pointed out that many people in the United States also opposed and唾弃 Dulles's policy of aggression against Taiwan. They mentioned that the Democrats in Maine had achieved what was called the biggest victory in the state in nearly fifty years, and one of the things the Democrats used in their campaign was to attack the government's foreign policy. Someone also specifically mentioned a passage from former Secretary of State Acheson, which was that "the United States is rolling into a war with China without friends and allies and has lost control of the situation in China." Dulles had no answer and used expressions such as "I very much doubt it" and "I have no opinion on this" to perfunctorily answer. But he also had to admit: "The U.S. government's policy in this regard should have the support of the American people," but in reality, some of the factors that determine policy "are so subtle that they are often not known to the public."

Dulles said that the U.S. had already given the People's Republic of China's ambassador in Warsaw a note on the morning of the 9th, expressing its willingness to resume ambassadorial-level talks with the People's Republic of China "at any time." He said: "There are quite a few issues that can be negotiated" in this meeting between China and the United States.

Finally, when talking about the Middle East issue, Dulles made it clear that the U.S. had no sincerity whatsoever in implementing the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting to withdraw its invading troops from the Middle East. He said: "I don't think that the current situation has shown that a complete withdrawal can be made on any date that we can set now." "The time is not ripe to announce any definite plan for a complete withdrawal."

    徒然的辩解　无力的威吓
    杜勒斯承认美国对我挑衅处境孤立
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在9日举行的记者招待会上强词夺理地为美国政府在台湾海峡地区的侵略挑衅行动进行辩护。他重申9月4日声明中的好战立场，并且再一次无耻地诬蔑中国人民解放自己的领土的斗争是“用武力来取得额外的领土”。招待会上追问最多的一个问题是美国政府是否已经决意在金门、马祖挑起一场包含有严重后果的战争。杜勒斯以典型的强盗口吻说，属于中国大陆内海岛屿的金门、马祖是美国的“前沿阵地”。中国人民解放自己的沿海岛屿“威胁”到“美国的整个地位和它在太平洋的自由世界盟国——从日本、朝鲜、冲绳、福摩萨（台湾）、菲律宾一直到东南亚——的整个地位”，“这牵涉到美国的切身利益”，“损害美国的安全”，因此“不能孤立地看待”金门马祖局势。
    杜勒斯重复他9月4日的声明，表示，美国总统在使用武力来阻挠中国人民解放金门马祖问题上“会毫不犹豫地作出决定”。但是他说，现在“还没有作出最后决定”。
    杜勒斯矢口抵赖美国曾经帮助蒋贼军增援金门。他说什么加强金门、马祖蒋贼军的决定是蒋介石集团作出的，并不出于美国的“鼓励”。而众所周知的事实是，一直到前天，美国侵略军还不顾中国政府的严正警告，派遣第七舰队舰只护送蒋介石船只给金门蒋贼军提供大量供应物资。
    杜勒斯蛮横地替美国军舰连续侵犯中国领海的挑衅行动辩解，他硬说中国政府宣布中国领海宽度为十二浬的规定是美国政府不能同意的，并且诬蔑中国政府采取这种完全符合本国利益并且纯粹是行使本国主权的决定是一种“掠夺”行为。有记者问，在美国的护航活动中，一艘蒋贼军的供应船已经被炮火击毁了，如果炮火命中了美国舰只结果会怎样。杜勒斯说，这可能有两种情况，一种是“偶然”的，一种是“有意”的。如果对美国军舰的袭击被判定为“有意袭击”，那美国就要“以某种方式进行回击”。
    记者问道：“你有没有得到什么保证，万一你在台湾海峡卷入同共产党中国的战争，国民党以外的其他盟国将支持你？”杜勒斯无法掩饰美国在侵略台湾和沿海岛屿问题上的处境非常孤立。他被迫承认，美国并“没有得到任何这样的保证”。
    记者们一再提出，美国国内也有许多人反对和唾弃杜勒斯的侵略台湾的政策。他们提到美国缅因州的民主党人获得了被称之为近五十年来在该州获得的最大的胜利，民主党人在竞选时利用的一点就是攻击政府的外交政策。还有人特别提到前国务卿艾奇逊的一段话，就是“美国正在没有朋友和盟国的情况下滚入同中国的战争中，并且已经丧失了对中国局势的控制。”杜勒斯无辞以对，而用“我非常怀疑”这种说法，“我对此没有意见”来搪塞。但是他也不得不承认：“美国政府这方面的政策本来是应当得到美国人民的支持的”，但是实际上决定政策的一些因素“是这么微妙，常常不为公众所知”。
    杜勒斯说，美国已经在9日上午给中华人民共和国驻华沙大使一份照会，表示准备“随时”恢复同中华人民共和国的大使级谈判。他说：在这次中美双方的会谈中“有相当多的问题可以谈判。”
    杜勒斯最后在谈到中东问题时表明，美国完全没有诚意来执行联合国大会紧急会议的决议，撤出它在中东的侵略军队。他说：“我并不认为目前的事态已经表明可以在我们现在能够订出的任何日期全部撤退”。“要宣布任何全部撤退的确定计划，时机还没有成熟。”
