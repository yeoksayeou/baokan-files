    The Lever Principle

    This was the third day of construction on the intake channel and suction well project for the Qinghua University Power Plant. Quicksand, again quicksand! People gathered at the wellhead, countless eyes watching the gooey bottom of the well. After pumping out the water, a shovel of quicksand was finally dug out, but before people could breathe a sigh of relief, quicksand flowed in again, filling it up.

    Some young men who usually "banish difficulties with laughter" now had anxious wrinkles on their foreheads; several professors wearing tortoiseshell glasses constantly took out small white handkerchiefs to wipe away sweat. The "wise guy" Xiao Chen moved his gaze away from the professors' faces and squatted on the scaffolding beside him, deflated like a punctured basketball. He looked at the wooden stakes driven into the already collapsed wellhead, and the professors' gesticulating and high-sounding discussions made his head spin. One analyzed the history of the geological formation, another suggested using a chain hoist to lower the pipes, but the quicksand continued to flow, flow. The eleven concrete water pipes, each weighing a ton, simply could not be lowered.

    "Obviously, this is a very profound problem that cannot be solved by the simple lever principle," Xiao Chen thought to himself.

    Speaking of the "lever principle," Xiao Chen had an embarrassing encounter. When the Agricultural Exhibition opened in Beijing, after seeing the reformed new agricultural implements, Xiao Chen shook his head at everyone: "What's so great about that? It's just a little bit of the lever principle." As a result, he was retorted by "Big Cannon" Liu Tieying: You look down on others, try to make one yourself! The two men flushed red and didn't speak for a long time. Comrades also kept criticizing him for "putting on airs."

    Suddenly, people cleared a path. The Youth League secretary led two experienced masters to the scene.

    The masters looked at the bottom of the well, took off their shirts, revealing arms with bulging muscles: "Come on, lower the iron baskets!"

    "Don't you need to pump out the water?" Xiao Chen asked hesitantly.

    One master smiled: "Pumping out the water will make the sand flow; it's better not to pump it. - Young man, work, it doesn't matter." He patted his chest, so loudly that it amused everyone.

    Basket after basket of quicksand was obediently dug out. Under the guidance of the masters, the students built wooden poles into rails, and the clumsy body of the concrete water pipe obediently rolled into the ditch...

    "Ah!..." Everyone watched the splashing grey-white muddy water and couldn't help but cheer.

    Xiao Chen suddenly slapped his forehead: "Oh, isn't this the lever principle?"

    "What's wrong?"

    Under everyone's gaze, Xiao Chen's face turned red. After a long while, he seemed to suddenly wake up and grabbed the master's hand, whispering, "Master, you can really solve problems!"

    The master patted him on the shoulder: "It's nothing. Young man, do more hands-on work and you'll understand!"

### 杠杆原理

    杠杆原理
    这是清华土电厂进水沟和吸水井工程施工的第三天，流沙，又是流沙！人们聚集在井口，无数双眼睛看着一片粘呼呼的井底。抽去水后，一铲流沙好容易铲了出来，但不等人们松一口气，立即，流沙源源而来，又被填满了。
    一些平日“谈笑间困难灰飞烟灭”的小伙子们这当儿也在额上划上了焦急的皱纹；几位戴着玳瑁眼镜的教授先生不断地掏出小白手绢揩汗。“智多星”小陈把眼光从教授脸上移开，像一个泄了气的篮球似的蹲在旁边的脚手板上发呆。他瞧着已经坍下的井口上打满了的木桩，教授们指手划脚的高谈阔论把他弄得晕头转向。这个分析地质形成的历史，那个说用导链起重机下管子，但流沙仍在不停地流，流。每根一吨重的十一节水泥水管根本下不去。
    “显然，这是个非常高深的问题，靠简单的杠杆原理是没法解决的。”小陈暗暗地想。
    提起“杠杆原理”，小陈有一件不光采的遭遇。农业展览会在北京开幕的时候，小陈看罢改革的新农具之后，逢人就摇头：“那算得了什么？不过是一点杠杆原理而已。”结果，碰上“大炮”刘铁英回顶了他一句：你瞧不起别人，你自己做出来试试！两个人脸红脖子粗的好半天不说话。同志们也一个劲儿批评他“翘尾巴”。
    突然，人们闪开了道。团支部书记领着两位老师傅来到了现场。
    老师傅看了看井底，一面脱下了上衣，露出了肌肉块块突起的胳膊：“来，下铁簸箕！”
    “不抽水吗？”小陈迟疑地问。
    一个师傅笑了：“抽掉水，沙就要流动；不抽水正好。——小伙子，干吧，不碍事。”他拍拍胸脯，拍得那样地响，把大伙儿全逗乐了。
    一筐筐流沙服服贴贴地挖了出来。在师傅的指使下，同学们把木杆搭成导轨，水泥水管的笨重的躯干乖乖地滚进了水沟……
    “啊！……”大伙望着飞溅的灰白泥水不禁欢呼起来。
    小陈猛地把脑瓜子一拍：“哎呀，这不是杠杆原理吗？”
    “怎么啦？”
    在大伙的目光下小陈的脸红了。好半天，他才猛醒似的拉住老师傅的手，低声地说：“师傅，您真能解决问题！”
    老师傅拍拍他的肩膀：“这算不了什么。小伙子，多动手干干就知道啦！”
