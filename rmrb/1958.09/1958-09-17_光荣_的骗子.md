    “Glorious” Liar
    Tie Yi
    U.S. President Eisenhower, after being persuaded by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, went to the television broadcasting station to deliver a speech. After calling out “My friends,” he said, “First, let us recall that, traditionally, our country and its government have always been enthusiastically committed to glorious peace, just as they are now.”
    What an “enthusiastic” and “glorious” liar.
    “Much talk means much error.” This should be a strictly observed commandment for liars. If President Eisenhower had only said this one sentence: “Traditionally, our country and its government have always been enthusiastically committed to glorious peace,” it would have been much better than what he said before. In this way, it could at least make some people who do not understand the tradition of the U.S. government have a little sympathy for the past tradition of the United States. With the latter half of the sentence, "just as they are now," it's a bit of a giveaway. Thus, people cannot help but examine what the U.S. government is doing now to verify the extent of their traditional "glory."
    Take the last two or three months, for example. The things the United States and its government have been enthusiastically committed to are probably these: First, sending troops to the Middle East and landing in Lebanon; second, instigating military rebellion in Haiti; third, wanting to send invading troops to Cuba; fourth, expanding aggression in the Far East, issuing belligerent statements, and conducting war provocations in China's territorial waters. As for those slightly further and even further back (such as instigating the Indonesian rebellion, launching aggressive wars on the Korean battlefield, occupying China's Taiwan, and participating in the Eight-Nation Alliance's ravaging of China, the hundred-year history of aggression against China, etc.), there is no need to elaborate.
    This is what the United States and its government have "always been enthusiastically committed to"; this is the "glory" of the United States, that is, the "peace" of the American brand. Eisenhower, disregarding his face, loudly called on the American people and its "allies" to support such a cause. Bah!

    “光荣”的骗子
    铁衣
    美国的艾总统，经过美国的杜国务卿的说服，跑到电视广播台上去发表了演说。他呼喊过“我的朋友们”以后说：“首先让我们回想一下，在传统上我们国家和它的政府一向是热情地致力于光荣的和平的，就像它们现在所做的一样。”
    好一个“热情”的、“光荣”的骗子。
    “言多必失”，这对说谎的人，应该是一个必须严格遵守的诫律。如果艾大总统只说这样一句：“在传统上我们国家和它的政府一向是热情地致力于光荣的和平的。”就要比他前边那样说好的多。这样，起码可以使一些不了解美国政府的传统的人，对美国过去的传统产生一点同情。有了后半句的“就像它们现在所做的一样”，可就有些透底了。于是人们便不免要把美国政府现在所做的事考察一番，来证实一下它们的传统“光荣”到什么程度？
    就拿最近两三个月来说吧，美国和它的政府热情地致力的事，大概有这么几件：一是出兵中东，登陆黎巴嫩；一是策动海地的军事叛乱；一是要派侵略兵去古巴；一是在远东扩大侵略，发表好战声明，在中国领海进行战争挑衅。至于稍远和更远些的（如策动印度尼西亚叛乱，在朝鲜战场上发动侵略战争，占领中国的台湾，以及参与八国联军对中国的蹂躏，百多年的侵华历史等等），就不必细说了。
    这就是美国和它的政府“一向所热情地致力”的勾当；这就是美国的“光荣”，也就是美国牌的“和平”。艾森豪威尔不顾脸面大声疾呼要求美国人民和它的“盟国”支持的也就是这样的事业。呸！
