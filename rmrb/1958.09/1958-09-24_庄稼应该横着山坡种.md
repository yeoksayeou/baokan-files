    Crops Should be Planted Horizontally on Hillsides
    Last winter and in the first half of this year, due to work reasons, I went to some tea-producing areas (mostly mountainous or semi-mountainous areas) in Anhui, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, and found that some crops on the hillsides were planted along the slope, with the planting rows perpendicular to the ground plane. This planting method is very unfavorable for maintaining soil and water. After cultivation, once there is heavy rain, fertile soil and nutrients will be washed away by the rain. Local farmers believe that this planting method makes cultivation and management convenient. It is not worth the loss to allow the fertile soil and painstakingly applied fertilizer to be washed away by rainwater for a moment of "convenience". Therefore, this planting method is not beneficial.
    I suggest that agricultural cooperatives in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas should thoroughly reform the above-mentioned planting method and change it to contour planting, that is, planting crops horizontally along the hillside, with the planting rows parallel to the ground plane. This effortless reform has great benefits in terms of soil conservation, water conservation, and fertilizer retention, and can greatly increase production.

### 庄稼应该横着山坡种

    庄稼应该横着山坡种
    去年冬天，和今年上半年，我因工作关系，到过安徽、浙江、福建等省的一些茶区（大部分为山区或半山区），发现有些山坡上的庄稼是顺着山坡种植，种植行和地平面垂直。这种耕作方法对保持水土很不利，耕锄之后，一遇上大雨，沃土和肥分就会被雨水冲去。当地农民认为这种种植方式，耕作管理方便。为了一时“方便”，便让那些肥沃的土壤和辛勤施下的肥料白白被雨水冲走是得不偿失的。因此，这种种植方式没有好处。
    我建议山区和半山区的农业社，对上述种植方式，应来一次彻底革新，改为等高条植，也就是使庄稼横着山坡种植，种植行和地平面平行。这样毫不费力的改革，对保土、保水、保肥等方面都有很大好处，能大大地增产。
