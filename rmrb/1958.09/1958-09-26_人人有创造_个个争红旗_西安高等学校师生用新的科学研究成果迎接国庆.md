Everyone Creates, Everyone Strives for the Red Flag
	Xi'an University Teachers and Students Use New Scientific Research Achievements to Greet National Day

	(Our reporter Qi Yuanzhen reports) Teachers and students in Xi'an universities are using new scientific research results and production achievements to greet "October 1st." These include cutting-edge scientific and technological projects such as solid-state luminescence with radioactive materials and rare earth elements, as well as projects closely related to current national production and teaching needs, such as steelmaking, coking, and the production of teaching instruments. Teachers and students at the Xi'an Military Medical University have put forward the slogan "Everyone creates, everyone launches a satellite," and they want to launch a thousand "satellites." In the past three days, the First Affiliated Hospital of this school has put forward more than 20,000 rationalization proposals, 95% of which are related to production and business; 66% of the proposals can be applied to practical work immediately. The production tasks of the chemical plant and glass factory run by Xi'an Medical College have doubled or even several times over. The chemical plant successfully trial-produced anhydrous alcohol with a purity reaching the domestic level. The original plan was to produce only 1,000 jin in September. Later, everyone put forward the fighting slogan of "People don't rest, factories don't rest, everyone works hard, collective dedication." Teachers and students built their own mud stoves and furnaces, installed production equipment, and worked in three shifts day and night. Even professors in their sixties worked late into the night. In this way, 700 jin have been produced in the past few days. They have doubled the original target, raising it to 2,250 jin.

	Currently, teachers and students from various schools are vigorously supporting steel production. More than 3,000 teachers and students from Xi'an Normal University, half of them are participating in labor at the Xi'an Steel Plant construction site, and half of them are in Chang'an. They strive to produce 80 tons of iron sand before "October 1st." The small steel plant built by teachers and students of Jiaotong University with self-made converters has recently started production. They are working overtime day and night to build another converter, striving to produce 400 tons of steel by the end of September. Teachers and students of the Chemistry Department of Northwest University want to produce ten to fifteen kinds of plastics before "October 1st" and are studying the problem of replacing steel with plastics.

	Among the completed projects, some have reached international and domestic advanced levels. Tu Tongjin, associate professor of Xi'an Military Medical University, successfully performed the "resection of cerebellopontine angle tumor above the tentorium cerebelli" on a patient on the 18th. The photoelectric colorimeter successfully trial-produced by this school is used to replace the microscope to determine red blood cells and hemoglobin, improving work efficiency by 60 to 80 times. The more than 600 dedication items proposed by the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical College have completed 300 items. Medical staff are actively improving their service attitude, exchanging work experience, learning and studying technology, and will achieve the goal of a "painless hospital" before "October 1st."

    人人有创造  个个争红旗
    西安高等学校师生用新的科学研究成果迎接国庆
    本报讯  记者戚元珍报道：西安地区高等学校师生们正在用新的科学研究成果和生产成就迎接“十一”。这里有属于尖端科学技术的含有放射性物质的固体发光、稀土元素，也有紧密结合当前国家生产和教学需要的炼钢铁、炼焦、制作教学仪器等项目。西安军医大学的师生提出“人人有创造，个个放卫星”的口号，他们要放射出一千颗“卫星”。三天来，这个学校的附属一院已经提出了二万多条合理化建议，其中95％是结合生产和业务的；66％的建议马上就能应用到实际工作中去。西安医学院办的化工厂、玻璃厂的生产任务，都翻了一番到几番。化工厂试制成功的纯度达到国内水平的无水酒精，原来计划9月份只生产一千斤，后来，大家提出“人不闲，厂不闲，人人苦战，集体献礼”的战斗口号，师生们自己泥锅台、炉灶，安装生产设备，分作三班生产，日夜苦战，连六十多岁的老教授也工作到深夜。这样，几天中，已经生产了七百斤。他们已将原来的指标翻了一番，提高到二千二百五十斤。
    目前各校师生正大力支援钢铁生产。西安师范学院的三千多名师生，一半到西安钢厂工地参加劳动，一半到长安，他们争取在“十一”前搞出八十吨铁砂。交通大学师生自造转炉建立的小钢铁厂，最近开始生产，他们正在日夜加班，再造一座转炉，力争在9月底生产四百吨钢。西北大学化学系师生要在“十一”前生产出十到十五种塑料，并正在研究以塑料代替钢的问题。
    在完成的项目中，有些已经达到国际水平和国内先进水平。西安军医大学副教授涂通今18日对一个病人顺利地完成了“自小脑幕上切除小脑桥脑角肿瘤”的手术。这个学校试制成功的光电比色计，用来代替显微镜测定红血球和血色素，提高工作效率六十倍到八十倍。西安医学院附属一院提出的六百多项献礼，已经完成了三百项。医务人员正在积极改进服务态度，交流工作经验，学习和钻研技术，“十一”前将实现“无痛病院”的目标。
