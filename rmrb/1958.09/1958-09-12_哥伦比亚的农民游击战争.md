The Peasant Guerrilla War in Colombia
Colombia　Aisi Ba'erda Ge

The topic I have chosen could well be used to write a tragedy. Now I will use it to make a brief historical narrative. The author of this article has personally witnessed the Colombian peasant guerrilla war.

Geographical Situation

The Republic of Colombia is located on the South American continent, with an area of 1,138,000 square kilometers. It faces the Pacific Ocean on one side and the Atlantic Ocean on the other. The Andes Mountains' three branches and turbulent rivers are distributed within its borders. The climate is diverse, with undeveloped grasslands and boundless plains. Underground, it contains oil, gold, platinum, emeralds, iron, coal, and salt. The land is fertile and suitable for agriculture and animal husbandry. Among Latin American countries, Colombia ranks second in the production of oil and coffee.

Colombia has a population of approximately 13 million, 80% of whom are landless and illiterate poor peasants, subjected to the triple enslavement of the US dollar, the Vatican, and the domestic oligarchy.

Historical and Political Situation

One hundred and forty-eight years ago, a peasant army, led by progressive intellectuals and inspired by the French Revolution, overthrew Spanish colonial rule after a cruel struggle. Since then, the country has adopted a republican system. The president and parliament are elected by the people, the president commands the army, and the judiciary is appointed by the parliament, which exercises legislative power.

In the early days of the republic, two parties were formed: the Conservative Party, with its religious authoritarian color, and the Liberal Party, which adhered to Christian democratic principles. In this century, the Conservative Party has been in power for forty-two years, while the Liberal Party has only been in power for sixteen years.

Foreign Interference

In foreign policy, there is no difference between these two traditional parties. They compete with each other to serve their American masters. The constantly persecuted Communist Party has never put down the banner of fighting for workers' rights and opposing imperialism. Whether underground, in exile, or in prison, the Communist Party has never ceased its struggle to defend democracy and national independence. By 1956, according to Decree No. 434 promulgated by the government, participating in political activities and engaging in communist propaganda was a crime, punishable by one to five years of imprisonment.

At the beginning of this century, the US armed forces, like pirates, occupied the Colombian province of Panama, seized the Panama Canal Zone between the two oceans, and established the present-day Republic of Panama in a separatist movement incited by the United States. The Colombian banana region on the Caribbean Sea has been, and still is, exploited by the United Fruit Company of the United States. In 1928, agricultural workers held a strike demanding better wages and benefits. The United Fruit Company then demanded that the Conservative Party government declare the strike illegal and suppress it, resulting in the killing of hundreds of agricultural workers. We have not forgotten, and it was still the United Fruit Company that subverted the supposedly communist Guatemalan People's Democratic Government, and with the shameless intervention of Dulles, supported a big adventurer, Armas, as president, who was killed in his presidential palace by one of his guards in July 1957. It is known that a powerful shareholder of the United Fruit Company is none other than the current US Secretary of State, Dulles.

In April 1948 (ten years ago), during the Ninth Pan-American Conference, the leader of the Colombian Liberal Party, the leader of the government opposition, and a prestigious politician, Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, was assassinated. When people learned of this crime, the capital of the republic, the site of the Pan-American Conference, the city of Bogotá, was engulfed in the flames of popular anger. Anti-government uprisings unfolded throughout the country. On the afternoon of the day the crime occurred, then-US Secretary of State General Marshall issued a statement claiming that the person who murdered Gaitán was an agent of international communism. But ten years later, history has exposed General Marshall's shameless slander and proved that the people were absolutely right to overthrow the reactionary government in intense anger at the time, and they did nothing wrong (Note 1).

Development of the Guerrilla

From this tragic day, tyranny began to shroud Colombia like the night. People built fortresses in the streets, corpses covered the squares and roads, people burned down the New Pan-American Conference Building (but did not find Marshall) and the Archbishop's Palace, seized the army's weapons, and organized people's militias. Faced with this unstoppable heroic struggle of the people, some prominent figures in the Liberal Party trembled, and they compromised with the government and betrayed the people. The Conservative president continued his rule with the support of the Liberal Party. At the same time, the positions in the government were evenly divided between the Liberal and Conservative parties, like splitting a watermelon in half. However, this heinous division of spoils did not last for many months, hardly enough time to consolidate the regime with greater strength.

Faced with a constant stream of betrayals, the people's militias organized in the mountains. At that time, the government's troops burned down farmers' houses, leveled their cemeteries, and killed numerous family members, so the peasants had no choice but to go to the mountains to survive. Before going to the mountains, they armed themselves with guns seized from mercenaries. At the same time, the tyranny forcibly closed the parliament, filled the prisons with political prisoners, workers, and students, closed newspapers, abolished trade unions, and handed over the trade unions, together with schools and universities, to the Jesuits to lead.

The guerrillas were developing on the plains, and the peasant forces were multiplying in the mountains. For four years, the peasants on the plains resisted the powerful attacks of the modern army equipped with American tanks, planes, and automatic weapons, which the United States provided, saying it was to "save Christian democracy from the clutches of communism."

In 1953, the government's military forces were exhausted. Faced with the growing power of the people's armed forces, the politicians and military personnel opposed to the Conservative leader Laureano Gómez decided to depose Gómez and replace him with Army Commander-in-Chief General Rojas Pinilla in order to suppress the anarchy in their own army (Note 2).

The general public welcomed the coup with joy because, due to the propaganda of the Liberal Party's oligarchic newspapers, the people naively believed that an era of peace and labor had begun. After seizing power, the military government expressed its willingness to cease fire with the guerrillas, signed a peace treaty, and also collected the weapons of farmers across the country.

Cruel Suppression

The Liberal Party flattered the military dictator to a ridiculous extent and demanded official positions from him at every moment. But the dictator's conservative and reactionary ideas could not satisfy their wishes at all. One day, the students were celebrating their own festival when the army, fully armed, came to stop this public demonstration. The students sat in the streets shouting protest slogans, and traffic was blocked. After a while, shots rang out, and more than twenty students lost their lives, and nearly a hundred students were injured. The masses unanimously protested with silence. Fear occupied the residents of Bogotá, who had witnessed the barbaric acts used against the forgotten peasant guerrillas four years ago. The Liberal Party politicians took advantage of this tragic moment to help the president, just like on April 9 when Gaitán was assassinated. They first protested, and then accepted several official positions given by the president under the pretext of maintaining peace (but later the president did not fulfill his promise). They betrayed the people once again.

Fighting Again

The movement of the press demanding the abolition of martial law was also very resolute because this law was incompatible with the peace treaty signed with the guerrillas. The army trampled on rural areas and towns again. Only a year after the signing of the peace treaty, the crimes and trampling that had driven the peasants to rebellion were repeated, and the people were betrayed once again. The peasants returned to the mountains, riversides, and grasslands, the bugle call of the guerrilla war sounded again, and the peasants once again took up arms to defend their lives and rights.

The Colombian people have had long years of struggle and paid a heavy price, with tens of thousands of farmers imprisoned, and some estimate that there have been 500,000 deaths in this tragic decade.

Now things are different. They must organize permanently and engage in production to feed their people's armed forces. They have implemented a plan for cultivation, food supply, and military education, opened schools, and implemented an effective mobilization system (liaison and defense). Now, the sound of the mimeograph machine rings out, and secret books and publications that were previously hidden are distributed and read among the peasant guerrillas. The guerrillas are very interested in Mao Zedong's works, and they are learning from the past Chinese guerrillas.

(Special contribution to this newspaper, translated by Sun Jiameng)

(Note 1) In April 1948, on the eve of the Pan-American Conference in Bogotá, the leader of the left wing of the Liberal Party, Gaitán, who was more radical in opposing the Conservative Party, was assassinated by reactionaries, triggering an armed riot by the masses. The Pan-American Conference venue was destroyed, and several major cities were once controlled by the insurgent masses, creating a crisis for the reactionary government. Marshall, the US Secretary of State who attended the conference at the time, instigated the Colombian government to carry out armed suppression and instructed the government to form a "joint cabinet" equally composed of the Conservative and Liberal parties, implementing reactionary rule.

    哥伦比亚的农民游击战争
    哥伦比亚　埃斯巴尔答哥
    我所选的这个题目，很可以用来写一部悲剧。现在我就用它来做一个简要的历史性的叙述吧。本文的作者，就曾目睹过哥伦比亚农民的游击战争。
    地理情况
    哥伦比亚共和国位于南美大陆上，面积为一百一十三万八千平方公里。它一面临太平洋，一面临大西洋，境内分布着安第斯山的三条支脉和奔腾的河流，气候多样，有着尚未被开垦的草原和无际的平原。地下蕴藏着石油、金、白金、绿宝石、铁、煤和盐。土地肥沃，适于农业和牧畜业。在拉丁美洲国家中，哥伦比亚的石油和咖啡的产量占第二位。
    哥伦比亚约有一千三百万人口，其中80％是无地和不识字的贫农，他们受着美元、梵蒂冈和本国寡头政府的三重奴役。
    历史和政治情况
    一百四十八年以前，一支由进步知识分子所指挥的农民军队，在法国大革命的鼓舞下，经过残酷的斗争，推翻了西班牙的殖民统治。从那时起，这个国家就采取了共和国制。总统和议会由人民选举产生，总统掌握军队，司法官由行使立法权的议院指派。
    共和国初期，形成了两个政党，即带有宗教独裁色彩的保守党和持着基督民主原则的自由党。在本世纪，保守党执政了四十二年，而自由党仅十六年。
    外国的干涉
    在外交政策上，这两个传统的政党是没有什么区别的。它们互相争着要为他们的美国主子卖力气。一直被不断迫害着的共产党从来没有收起过争取工人权利和反帝斗争的旗帜。无论是在地下，在流放中，还是在监狱中，共产党从来没有间断过保卫民主和民族独立的斗争。到1956年，根据政府颁布的第434号法令，参加政治活动和进行共产主义宣传就是犯罪，这些人就要被判处一年到五年的徒刑。
    本世纪初期，美国的武装力量，像海盗一样，占领了哥伦比亚的巴拿马省，霸占了两洋之间的巴拿马运河区，并在一次由美国煽动起来的分裂运动中，成立了今天的巴拿马共和国。靠着加勒比海的哥伦比亚的巴那埃拉区曾经、而且现在仍然受着美国联合果品公司的剥削。1928年，农业工人们举行了一次罢工，要求改善工资待遇，联合果品公司就要求保守党政府，把这次罢工说成是非法的而加以镇压，成百的农业工人被杀害了。我们并没有忘记，也还是联合果品公司颠复了被硬说是共产党的危地马拉人民民主政府，在杜勒斯的无耻干预之下，扶植一个大冒险家阿马斯为总统，这位总统在1957年7月被他的一个侍卫杀死在他的总统府内。大家知道，联合果品公司的一位有权势的股东，正是现任的美国国务卿杜勒斯。
    1948年（即十年前）的4月，正当举行第九届泛美会议期间，哥伦比亚的自由党的领袖、政府反对派的领袖、一位有威望的政治家霍赫·埃列塞尔·盖丹被谋杀了。当人们知道了这个罪行，这个共和国的首都、泛美会议的会址波哥大城掀起了人民的愤怒的火焰。反对政府的起义在全国展开了。在罪行发生的当天下午，那时的美国国务卿马歇尔将军在报上发表了声明，他硬说谋害盖丹的人是国际共产主义的代理人。但是十年后，历史揭穿了马歇尔将军的无耻诬蔑，并证明了当时人民在强烈的愤怒下推翻反动政府是完全正确的，他们并没有做错（注一）。
    游击队的发展
    从这悲惨的一天起，暴政开始像黑夜一样笼罩了哥伦比亚。人民在街道上筑垒，尸体遮盖广场和道路，人民烧掉了新泛美会议的大厦（但并未找到马歇尔）和大主教府，夺下军队的武器，组织了人民的民兵。在人民的这种不可抑止的英勇斗争面前，自由党一些知名人士被吓得发抖了，于是，他们同政府妥协，出卖了人民。保守党人的总统在自由党人的支持下继续他的统治。同时，在自由党和保守党之间就像把一个西瓜分为两半那样，把政府的位置平分了。然而这种穷凶恶极的分赃，并没有持续几个月，几乎没有足够的时间来用较大的力量稳固这个政权。
    面临着层出不穷的背叛行为，人民的民兵在山上组织起来了。当时政府的军队烧掉了农民的房子，铲平了他们的墓场，杀害了为数众多的家属，于是农民为了活下去只有上山这一条路。在上山之前，他们用从雇佣军手中夺取过来的枪支武装了自己。同时，暴政用武力封闭了议院，监狱里关满了政治犯、工人和学生，封闭了报馆，取消了工会，把工会连同学校和大学一起交给了耶稣会来领导。
    游击队在平原上发展着，农民队伍也在高山中成倍地增加着。四年中，平原上的农民们就是这样地抵抗着用美国的坦克、飞机和自动武器装备起来的现代化军队强有力的进犯，美国提供这些装备说是为了“从共产主义魔手中拯救基督民主”。
    1953年，政府的军事力量消耗殆尽，面对着人民武装的不断壮大的威力，反对保守党头子罗列安诺·戈麦斯的政客们和军人们，为了压抑自己军队中的无政府主义，就决定废黜戈麦斯，以陆军总司令罗哈斯·皮尼亚将军来代替他（注二）。
    一般人民曾经欢欣鼓舞地欢迎了这次政变，因为由于自由党寡头报纸的宣传，人民天真地以为开始了一个和平与劳动的时代。军政府夺得政权后，表示愿意同游击队停战，并签订了和约，同时也收回了全国农民的武器。
    残酷的镇压
    自由党人奉承阿谀这个军事独裁者到了非常可笑的地步，并每时每刻都向他要求官位。但是这位独裁者的保守反动的思想，根本不可能满足他们的愿望。一天，学生们庆祝自己的节日，军队全副武装地开来阻止这次公开的示威。学生们坐在街上高喊抗议口号，交通堵塞了。一会，枪响了，二十多名学生丧失了生命，近百名学生受了伤。群众一致以沉默来抗议。恐惧占据了目睹过四年前用来对付被遗忘了的农民游击队的野蛮行为的波哥大居民。自由党的政客们利用这悲剧的时机来帮助总统，就像在4月9日盖丹被谋杀时一样。他们先去抗议，然后又借口维持和平接受了总统给予的几个官位（但后来总统没有实现他的诺言）。他们又一次背叛了人民。
    再度起来战斗
    报界要求废除战争法的运动也非常坚决，因为这个法律是与同游击队签订的和约不相容的。军队又践踏农村和市镇了。和约签订后仅仅一年的功夫，曾把农民逼上梁山的罪行和践踏又重演了，人民又一次地被出卖了。农民又回到了山上、河边和草原里，游击战争的号角又吹响了，农民再度拿起武器来保卫自己的生命和权利。
    哥伦比亚人民已经有了长期斗争的经验，也付出了惨痛的代价，成千上万的农民被关在监狱中，有人估计，在这悲惨的十年中有五十万人的死亡。
    现在已经不同了。他们要永远组织起来，并且要从事生产以养活自己的人民武装。他们执行了耕耘、供养和军事教育的计划，开设了学校，实行了有效的动员制度（联络和保卫）。现在，响起了油印机的声音，过去秘密的书刊也开始在农民游击队中散发并且被阅读了。游击队员们对于毛泽东的著作很感兴趣，他们向过去的中国游击队员学习。
                      （本报特约稿，孙家孟译）
    （注一）1948年4月，波哥大泛美会议前夕，由于反对保守党较激烈的自由党左派领袖盖丹遭反动派暗杀，引起群众武装暴动，泛美会议会场被捣毁，若干大城市一度为起义群众所掌握，反动政府发生危机。当时出席会议的美国国务卿马歇尔策动哥伦比亚政府实行武装镇压，并指使该政府组成了保守党和自由党各半的“联合内阁”，实行反动统治。
