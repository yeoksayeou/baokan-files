Brothers Come From Afar
—Welcome to the Soviet Azerbaijan State Song and Dance Ensemble
Lü Ji

    We are very excited to welcome the Soviet Azerbaijan State Song and Dance Ensemble from east of the Caspian Sea to visit and perform in our country! This ensemble embodies the socialist content and national form cultural policy that has made the culture of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union unprecedentedly prosperous. Through their performances, the hearts of our two peoples will be more closely united, because their many programs praising the new socialist life and many programs praising peace and friendship will be warmly welcomed by our people, and their song and dance forms are also very familiar to our people.

    In 1952, Comrade Pebtov's performance in our country aroused enthusiastic reactions, which is already a well-known fact. Correctly speaking, the lingering sound of the "Peddler's Song" and "In That Distant Place" that he sang still lingers in our ears, as if his performance had just ended. I am convinced that the performance of the Azerbaijan State Song and Dance Ensemble will also leave us with an extremely deep impression, making us never forget it, because this song and dance ensemble, like Comrade Pebtov, grew up from the socialist life soil of the Azerbaijani nation.

    The artistic achievements and experience of the Azerbaijan State Song and Dance Ensemble over the past twenty-two years will certainly be a beneficial learning experience for our country's song and dance art circles, because they have systematically sorted out the Azerbaijani national folk song and dance art, and developed their national song and dance art based on the principle of socialist content and national form, and created modern themed programs such as "Female Communist Youth League Member," "Collective Farm Song," "Partisan Song," and "Red Army Soldier." Moreover, from the very beginning, this song and dance ensemble strived to express the characteristics and colors, rhythms, styles, and unique melodies and tonal systems of Azerbaijani folk music. These are still issues that many of our composers are exploring, and they are also some problems that we urgently need to solve. Their experience can be used as our reference.

    Let us here wish the Azerbaijan State Song and Dance Ensemble a successful performance in our country! We sincerely hope that through the performance of the Azerbaijan State Song and Dance Ensemble, the Chinese and Soviet people will be more closely united, because at this time some people around us are clamoring for wars of aggression. The most powerful blow to aggression is the close unity of the Chinese and Soviet people. Let us shout: "Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet people!"

    兄弟自远方来
    ——欢迎苏联阿塞拜疆国家歌舞团
    吕骥
    我们怀着十分兴奋的心情欢迎来自里海以东的、体现了使苏联各族人民文化空前繁荣的社会主义内容、民族形式的文化政策的苏联阿塞拜疆国家歌舞团到我们国家来进行访问演出！通过他们的演出，我们两国人民的心将更加紧密地团结在一起，因为他们的许多歌颂社会主义新生活的节目和许多歌颂和平友谊的节目将获得我国人民热烈的欢呼，而他们的歌舞形式对于我国人民也是十分亲切的。
    1952年，裴布托夫同志在我国表演所唤起的热情的反映，已经是大家所熟知的事实，正确地说，他所唱的“货郎的歌”，“在那遥远的地方”的余韵还在我们耳边缭绕，好像才结束他的表演似的，我深信阿塞拜疆国家歌舞团的表演同样地会给我们留下极深刻的印象，使我们永远不能忘记，因为这个歌舞团和裴布托夫同志一样，是从阿塞拜疆民族的社会主义生活土壤中成长起来的。
    阿塞拜疆国家歌舞团二十二年来在艺术上的成就和经验，也一定能够给我国歌舞艺术界以有益的学习，因为他们系统地整理了阿塞拜疆民族的民间歌舞艺术，并且根据以社会主义内容民族形式这个原则发展了他们的民族歌舞艺术，创造了像“女共青团员”“集体农庄之歌”、“游击队之歌”、“红军战士”这一类现代题材的节目。而且，这个歌舞团从一开始就力求表达阿塞拜疆民间音乐的特点和色彩、奏节、风格及其曲调和调式体系的独特点。这些问题还是我们许多作曲家在探索的，也是我们亟待解决的一些问题，他们的经验正可以作为我们的借鉴。
    让我们在这里预祝阿塞拜疆国家歌舞团在我国演出的成功！我们衷心希望通过阿塞拜疆国家歌舞团的演出，中苏人民团结得更加紧密，因为这时候有人在我们的身边叫嚣着侵略战争，对待侵略最有力的打击就是中苏两国人民紧密的团结，让我们高呼：“中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！”
