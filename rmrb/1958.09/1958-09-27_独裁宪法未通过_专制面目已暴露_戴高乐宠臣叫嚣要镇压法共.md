Xinhua News Agency, September 25th Dispatch from Paris: Even before the dictatorial draft “constitution” has been passed in the “referendum,” the French De Gaulle government is increasingly exposing its intention to suppress progressive forces.

De Gaulle's confidant, Minister of Propaganda Soustelle, openly clamored in a luncheon speech on the 24th that after the "referendum," the government "must immediately" "take action" against the French Communist Party to prevent "the new system of the Fifth Republic from being jeopardized." He also falsely accused the French Communist Party of "colluding" with the Algerian National Liberation Front, attempting to incite chauvinistic sentiments among certain classes in France to oppose the French Communist Party.

At the French cabinet meeting held on the same day, a plan to intensify large-scale persecution of Algerians residing in mainland France was also approved. Officials refused to disclose the contents of this plan, allegedly for fear of being accused of implementing "dictatorship." However, it is said that once the new draft "constitution" is passed, a frenzied suppression of Algerian residents in mainland France will begin.

In addition, as the date of the French "referendum" approaches, fascists are also increasingly rampant in carrying out violence against people who oppose the draft "constitution."

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 25th: "L'Humanité" commented in today's editorial on the clamor made by De Gaulle government's Propaganda Minister Soustelle on the 24th, that "action" should be taken against the French Communist Party immediately after the "referendum", saying: This full of hatred and slanderous attacks on the French Communist Party proves that Soustelle is very afraid of the widespread support that the French Communist Party's policies have received throughout the country. The French Communist Party is the number one enemy of those who advocate dictatorship and advocate war. The editorial said that Soustelle's attack on the French Communist Party proves that he is afraid of the unity of republicans under the threat of fascism.

"L'Humanité" pointed out that the representatives of French fascism undoubtedly dream of declaring the French Communist Party illegal. The newspaper said, but Soustelle should not forget that taking such action against a large party that has the trust of six million French people is not something that can be done casually. Faced with this threat, democrats will further realize the need to be more vigilant. Because they know that this measure against the French Communist Party will be the prelude to a general offensive against all those who oppose dictatorship.

### 独裁宪法未通过  专制面目已暴露  戴高乐宠臣叫嚣要镇压法共

    独裁宪法未通过  专制面目已暴露
    戴高乐宠臣叫嚣要镇压法共
    据新华社25日讯  巴黎消息：独裁“宪法”草案还没有在“公民投票”中通过，法国戴高乐政府就已经日益暴露了准备镇压进步力量的面目。
    戴高乐的亲信、宣传部长苏斯戴尔24日在一次午宴演说中公开叫嚣说，“公民投票”以后，政府就“必须马上”对法国共产党“采取行动”，以免“第五共和国的新制度遭到危害”。他还诬指法国共产党同阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线“相互勾结”，企图以此煽动法国某些阶层的沙文主义情绪，来反对法国共产党。
    在同一天举行的法国内阁会议上，还通过了一项加紧对侨居法国本土的阿尔及利亚人实行大规模迫害的计划。官方拒绝透露这项计划的内容，据说是因为害怕因此被人指责为实行“独裁”。但是据透露，只要新“宪法”草案一旦获得通过，对法国本土阿尔及利亚居民的疯狂镇压即将开始。
    另外，随着法国“公民投票”日期的临近，法西斯分子也日益猖狂地对反对“宪法”草案的人民施行暴行。
    新华社巴黎25日电  “人道报”在今天的社论中就戴高乐政府宣传部长苏斯戴尔24日发出要在“公民投票”后立即对法国共产党“采取行动”的叫嚣发表评论说：这种对法国共产党的满腔仇恨和诽谤攻击，证明了苏斯戴尔非常害怕法国共产党的政策在全国各地得到的广泛支持。法国共产党是那些主张独裁和主张战争的人们的第一号敌人。社论说，苏斯戴尔对法国共产党的攻击证明了他害怕共和人士在法西斯威胁下的团结一致。
    “人道报”指出，法国法西斯主义的代表们无疑是梦想把法国共产党宣布非法的。报纸说，但是苏斯戴尔不应该忘记，对得到六百万法国人的信任的一个大党采取这种做法，不是随便可以做到的。面对着这种威胁，民主人士将进一步认识到必须提高警惕。因为他们知道，对付法国共产党的这种措施，将是对所有反对独裁的人们的总攻势的前奏。
