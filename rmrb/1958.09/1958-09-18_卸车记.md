    A Record of Unloading Coal
    Tanggu Locomotive Depot　Li Fushan
    The telephone rang, and Union Chairman Li picked up the receiver. It was a call from the station, saying that there were six coal cars from the fuel plant, a total of 256 tons, scheduled to arrive at 20:00 hours. Chairman Li thought, "Isn't that too late? Everyone will be off work; who will unload it?" So he said, "Why not send them now, before people leave work? It can be unloaded in a little while." The station replied, "We can't send them now, they're still stuck in the main train." What to do? So everyone decided to wait until the cars were unloaded before going off work; they couldn't let six cars sit overnight.
    20:00 had already passed, and the hands of those waiting to unload the coal were getting itchy. Duty Officer Shen Guoan, urged by everyone, had to pick up the phone and ask the station again; who knew the station would push it back to 21:00. It's understandable, as the station was changing shifts at that time, and the success of the night's work depended on this beginning. Chairman Li, fearing that everyone would be too tired from waiting too long, said, "Everyone go back and rest; we won't unload tonight." Before he could finish speaking, everyone said in unison, "The fuel plant only has three people on the night shift; how long would it take them to unload six cars of coal? Let's wait and unload; strength lost can be regained." No one was willing to leave.
    At this time, Old Lin and Zhang Dache, who had just gotten off work—both Tianjin locals—upon hearing that they needed to unload coal cars, didn't even go home. They ate a little something and prepared to join this "fierce battle." Although they were tired from a day's work, their spirits were still high.
    The team preparing to unload the cars stood in a row, each person with a shovel. As soon as the cars stopped, everyone swarmed forward, claiming three cars each. Look! Everyone took off their vests and rolled up their trousers. All that could be heard was the sound of shovels scraping coal. Old Lin and Old Cai, these two workers in their fifties, didn't show any weakness at all. They tied towels around their heads and shoveled non-stop, not even straightening their backs. I jumped onto another car, where Chairman Li and Duty Officer Shen were already working hard. Duty Officer Shen wasn't even wearing shoes, working barefoot. Truly, many hands make light work, and soon there was only one car left to unload. Chairman Li said, "Let the fuel plant unload this car themselves." Before he could continue, everyone seemed to catch fire, and they said one after another, "We've done the bulk of it, why leave a tail end?" Saying that, Wang Jinchen, Zhao Bingyong, Han Mingquan, and a few other young people like us got on the car and unloaded it in one go. A fierce battle, and the task was victoriously completed. Looking at the watch, it was already 1:00 AM. Each person grabbed their clothes, and with joyful hearts, sang "Socialism is Good" as they walked home.

    卸车记
    塘沽机务驻在所　李富山
    电话铃响了，工会李主席拿起电筒。原来是车站打来的电话，说是有燃料厂六个煤车，共计二百五十六吨，二十点多钟给送到。李主席想：那不是太晚了吗，人都下班了，谁卸呀。于是便说：“现在送来不好吗，人都还没下班，一会儿就能卸完。”“送不了，还在大列里夹着没倒出来呢。”车站回答说。那怎么办呢？于是大家决定，等卸完了车再下班，怎么也不能让六辆车停放一夜呀。
    二十点已经过了，等卸煤的人手心早发痒了。值班员申国安在大家催促下，只好拿起电话再次催问车站；谁知车站又推拖在二十一点钟给送。也难怪，这时车站正交班，一夜工作好坏就看这个开头呢。李主席怕大家等的时间长了太劳累，便说：“大家回去休息吧，这次不卸啦。”话音未落，大家异口同声地说：“燃料厂夜班就三个人，六车煤得卸到什么时候。等着卸吧，力气去了还会来呢。”谁也不肯走。
    这时刚下班的老蔺头和张大车——他们都是天津家，一听说要卸煤车，连家也不回了，好歹吃了点饭，准备参加这场“激战”。虽然他们累了一天了，精神还是那么饱满。
    准备卸车的队伍站成一行，一人一把铁锹。车刚停下，大家一拥而上，一占就是三个车。看！大家脱去了背心，掠下了长裤，只听得铁锹铲煤沙沙的响。老蔺头和老蔡头这两位五十多岁的老工人，一点也不示弱，毛巾往头上一扎，连腰也不直，锹连锹的往下锄。我又跳上另外一个车，李主席和申值班员早就在这儿干上了。申值班员连鞋也没有穿，赤着脚干。真是人多好干活，不一会儿就剩一个车未卸了。李主席说：“这一车让燃料厂自己卸吧。”没容他再往下说，大家像是火了，你一言我一语的说：“大头都干了，何必剩个尾巴。”说着王尽臣、赵秉勇、韩铭泉等我们几个青年上了车，一口气就卸下来了。一场激战，胜利地完成了任务。看了看表，已经是深夜一点钟了。各自拿着衣服，带着高兴的心情，唱着“社会主义好”的歌子走回家去。
