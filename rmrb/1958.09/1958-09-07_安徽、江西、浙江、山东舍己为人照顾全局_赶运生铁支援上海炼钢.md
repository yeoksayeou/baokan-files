Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 6th - The people of Anhui are supporting Shanghai with the heroic spirit and actions of "transporting a ton of iron if they have a ton of iron, continuing to make iron and continuing to transport it."

In order to support Shanghai in manufacturing metallurgical equipment for the whole country, Anhui Province has adopted the measures of first satisfying the needs of the central government, then Shanghai, and then solving the province's own smelting and casting needs, transporting most of the iron produced by newly built blast furnaces and the scrap iron purchased from all over the province to Shanghai. In August, 21,500 tons of iron were supplied to Shanghai; in September, it was decided to continue to transport 56,000 tons.

In August, due to transportation difficulties in the mountainous areas of Anhui, pig iron could not be shipped out in time. In order to save time, Anhui Province would rather postpone the installation time of the Anhui No. 2 Textile Factory, which was under construction, and first transfer the iron it needed to Shanghai. Steel plants and machinery plants in Huainan, Hefei and other places have also tried every means to overcome difficulties and transfer the iron urgently needed by their factories to Shanghai first. In order to support Shanghai, the transportation department of Anhui Province also specially dispatched 30 trucks to the mountainous area of Anqing to transport iron.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 6th - The people of Jiangxi Province guarantee that the pig iron they have just produced will first be used to support the steel plants in Shanghai. In the past few days, 2,000 tons of pig iron have been shipped to Shanghai, and another 20,000 tons will be shipped in succession within the month.

In the process of transferring pig iron, many places have shown valuable selflessness. Pingxiang County was originally only responsible for the transfer of 300 tons of pig iron, but the Pingxiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, considering that the needs of the national plan must be met first, slowed down the steel needed for water conservancy projects in the coming winter and spring, and transferred 100 tons more pig iron to the state. The county is currently vigorously fighting drought, and there is a shortage of labor, but after the county party committee put forward the call to ensure the completion of the transfer task on time, all agricultural cooperatives in the county immediately drew more than 700 members, who used carts and carried them by hand, and worked continuously for five days and five nights to transport all the transferred pig iron scattered in various parts of the county to the railway station.

In order to resolutely ensure the transfer task, Bai Dongcai, secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally took charge and directed this work. Ma Jian, secretary of the Ji'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, also led more than 1,000 people in the county to go up the mountains to build roads, open iron mines, and build iron smelting furnaces to ensure the rapid completion of the national transfer task.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 6th - Workers of Zhejiang Steel Plant, Shaoxing Steel Plant, and transportation departments of Hangzhou and Shaoxing are working day and night to transfer pig iron to support Shanghai.

Participating in the shock transport of iron are also more than 4,000 people from provincial and municipal government agencies, enterprises, schools, and commercial departments, who formed a bicycle iron transport team. Starting from August 31, this bicycle iron transport team went to Zhejiang Steel Plant and used their hands to load pieces of pig iron onto bicycles and transport them to the Genshanmen Station in Hangzhou, 12 kilometers away. Some cadres transported 400 jin of pig iron a day. When it rained heavily and the roads were muddy, they pushed their cars and walked. Young Pioneers also organized cheering stations along the way to help the transport team. In the past few days, this transport team and the transportation department have transported more than 1,000 tons of pig iron from Zhejiang Steel Plant to the station.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th - According to reports from relevant departments in Shanghai, the people of Shandong have shown great enthusiasm in supporting Shanghai's steel industry.

The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out at a meeting attended by the secretaries of all prefectural committees in the province in August that the materials supporting Shanghai must be completed in accordance with the cooperation plan. After the meeting, all departments and regions conscientiously implemented this instruction. At that time, it was the rainy season in Shandong, and heavy rains broke the transportation lines, affecting transportation, and the scrap steel collected from all over the province could not be transported out. After the Shandong Provincial Planning Commission checked and discovered this problem, it immediately convened a meeting of responsible persons from materials, transportation, commerce and other relevant departments, mobilized cadres, students and farmers of government agencies, and used the methods of carrying on their shoulders and carrying people to quickly concentrate the scattered scrap steel from all directions to railway stations along the line. By the end of August, Shandong Province had shipped more than 10,000 tons of scrap steel to Shanghai.

    安徽、江西、浙江、山东舍己为人照顾全局
　　赶运生铁支援上海炼钢
    据新华社合肥6日电　安徽人民正在以“有一吨铁运一吨铁，继续炼铁继续运”的豪迈的气概和行动支援上海。
    安徽省为了支援上海为全国制造冶金设备，采取先满足上调、满足上海再解决本省冶炼铸造的措施，把全省各地新建高炉生产的铁和收购的废铁，大部调运上海。在8月份，支援上海的铁就有两万一千五百吨；9月份决定继续调运五万六千吨。
    8月份由于安徽山区运输困难，生铁不能及时运出。为了抢时间，安徽省宁可推迟正在施工的安徽第二纺织厂的安装时间，把自己要用的铁先调给上海。淮南、合肥等地的炼钢厂、机械厂，也都想尽办法克服困难，把本厂急需的铁先调给上海。安徽省交通部门为了支援上海，还专门派出三十辆汽车到安庆山区运铁。
    新华社南昌6日电　江西省人民保证把自己刚刚炼出的生铁首先支援上海各钢铁厂。最近几天内运往上海的生铁就有两千吨，另有两万吨将在月内陆续启运。
    在生铁上调的过程中，许多地方表现了可贵的舍己为人的品质。萍乡县原来只担负三百吨生铁的上调任务，但是中共萍乡县委考虑到必须首先满足国家计划的需要，就把今冬明春兴修水利等工程所需要的钢铁放缓一步，多给国家上调了一百吨生铁。这个县当前正在大力抗旱，劳动力缺乏，可是县委提出保证上调任务按时完成的号召以后，全县农业社立即抽出七百多社员，用车推、人挑，连续干了五天五夜，将分散在县内各地的上调生铁全部运到了火车站。
    为了坚决保证上调任务，中共江西省委书记白栋材亲自挂帅，指挥这个工作。中共吉安地委书记马健并且领导本县一千多群众上山兴修道路、大开铁矿、大建炼铁炉，保证迅速完成国家上调任务。
    据新华社杭州6日电　浙江钢铁厂、绍兴钢铁厂，以及杭州、绍兴两市的交通运输部门等单位的职工，正在日夜忙着调运生铁支援上海。
    参加突击运铁任务的，还有由省市机关、企业、学校、商业部门的四千多人组成的自行车钢铁运输队。8月31日起，这支自行车钢铁运输队就开赴浙江钢铁厂，用手将一块块生铁搬上自行车，运到十二公里远的杭州艮山门车站。有的干部一天就运四百斤生铁。逢着大雨道路泥泞的时候，他们就推着车走。少先队员们也在沿途组织了鼓动站，为运输队助战。在最近的几天中，这支运输队同运输部门从浙江钢铁厂运到车站的生铁已达一千多吨。
    新华社上海6日电　据记者从上海有关部门获悉，山东人民在支援上海钢铁工业方面表现了极大的热情。
    中共山东省委在8月份召开的有全省地委书记参加的会议上指出，按照协作计划，支援上海的物资必须完成。会后各部门和各个地区都认真贯彻了这一指示。当时，正是山东的雨季，暴雨冲断了交通线，影响了运输，全省各地搜集的废钢铁运不出来。山东省计委检查发现了这一问题后，立即召集物资、交通、商业等有关部门负责人会议，动员了机关干部、学生和农民，用肩挑、人担的办法，把分散的废钢铁从四面八方迅速集中到铁路沿线车站。到8月底，山东省运往上海的废钢铁已达一万多吨。
