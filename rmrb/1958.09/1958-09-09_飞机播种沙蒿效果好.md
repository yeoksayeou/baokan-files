　　Airplane Seeding of Sand Sagebrush Has Good Results

　　In order to do a good job in sand stabilization, the Yulin area of Shaanxi Province used An-2 type aircraft to test seeding 190,000 mu of sand sagebrush in mid-July. According to an inspection one week after sowing, the average germination rate was above 60%, and the growth was vigorous.

　　Airplane seeding for sand stabilization is the first time in our country. Through this trial planting, it proves that using airplanes for seeding sand stabilization can achieve the goals of more, faster, better, and more economical results.

　　Airplane seeding is fast and covers a large area. In the Yulin area, the woodland is about five kilometers from the airport at the nearest point and about twenty kilometers at the farthest. Each plane seeds an average of about 30,000 jin per day, with a planting area of 24,000 mu, which is equivalent to 1,200 times the amount of manual seeding. The seeds sown by airplane are distributed very evenly; at the same time, the seeds are agitated by the agitator in the seed bin and slide through a seeding trough of more than one meter, so the seed coat is slightly damaged, which is conducive to germination.

　　On the surface, the cost of airplane seeding is relatively high at present. The cost of this airplane seeding is about one jiao per mu (including other expenses), while manual seeding is only five fen per mu. But in fact, manual seeding activities can only be carried out in places closer to the village. If you really go deep into the large desert for seeding, the cost will not be low, and at the same time, food and accommodation in the large desert will cause great difficulties for people. In addition, the seeding amount of manual seeding is not easy to control, and if four or two more seeds are used per mu, it will exceed one jiao. Therefore, as long as you carefully calculate the detailed accounts from all aspects, you will find that using airplanes to seed sand stabilization is a very economical thing.

### 飞机播种沙蒿效果好

　　飞机播种沙蒿效果好
    陕西省榆林地区为了作好固沙工作，在7月中旬用安二型飞机试播沙蒿十九万亩。据播后一星期的检查，平均发芽率在60％以上，而且生长旺盛。
    飞机播种固沙在我国还是第一次，通过这次试种，证明用飞机播种固沙能达到多快好省的目的。
    飞机播种速度快、播得多。榆林地区林地近的离机场五公里，远的约二十公里，每日每架飞机平均播种三万市斤左右，播种面积二万四千亩，相当于人工播种的一千二百倍。飞机播种的种子分布非常均匀；同时种子在种仓里受过捣拌器的捣打和滑过一公尺多的播种槽，因而种皮受到轻微的损伤，有利于发芽。
    从表面上看，目前飞机播种成本比较高。这次飞机播种每亩成本约一角钱（包括其他开支），人工播种每亩只有五分钱。但实际上人工播种活动只能在离村庄较近的地方，假若真正深入大面积沙漠中播种，成本就不会低，同时在大沙漠中食宿会给人造成极大的困难。另外人工播种的播种量不易控制，假若每亩多用四两种子就超过了一角钱了。所以只要从各方面算一下细账，就会发现用飞机播种固沙是一件很省的事。
