    To the heroic soldiers on the Fujian Front:
    We are a group of students studying at Moscow University in the Soviet Union. When we heard about the crimes of US imperialism colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek gang to create tension in the Taiwan Strait, especially after hearing on the radio on the evening of the 10th that the US-Chiang Kai-shek forces repeatedly violated our territorial waters and airspace and shelled peaceful residents in Xiamen and other places, it aroused our immense indignation.
    Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's sacred territory. We will never tolerate US imperialism's attempt to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, or even dream of supporting the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in harassing the coastal areas. If US imperialism dares to invade, we will certainly beat them until they are bloody and battered. Chairman Mao said long ago: US imperialism is a paper tiger, and the Chinese people will once again expose this paper tiger to the whole world.
    You are the soldiers standing on the front line of the struggle, undertaking the most arduous tasks of the struggle. We extend our most sincere congratulations to you on the brilliant victories you have already achieved, and we wish you heroic and tenacious achievements and even greater victories.
    The hearts of all Chinese people are closely tied to you. We have expressed our attitude to the embassy. Once the motherland needs us, we will return to the motherland and stand on the front line of the struggle alongside you to fight the enemy. Now, we must work harder to learn the skills to build the motherland, so that our country's science can catch up with the world level more quickly.
    Chinese students at Moscow University, Soviet Union

    留苏学生表决心
    福建前线的英雄将士们：
    我们是一群在苏联莫斯科大学学习的留学生。当我们听到美帝国主义勾结蒋匪帮在台湾海峡制造紧张局势的罪行，特别是10日晚在收音机中听到美蒋一再侵犯我国领海领空及炮击厦门等地和平居民的消息后，激起了我们无比的愤慨。
    台湾是我国神圣不可侵犯的领土的一部分，美帝国主义妄图阻挠中国人民解放台湾，甚至梦想支持蒋匪侵扰沿海地区，这是我们坚决不能容忍的。美帝国主义胆敢来犯，我们就一定要打得他头破血流。毛主席早说过：美帝国主义是纸老虎，中国人民一定会再一次在全世界面前揭穿这只纸老虎。
    你们是站在斗争最前线的战士，担负着最艰巨的斗争任务，我们对你们已经取得的辉煌战绩，致最衷心的祝贺，并预祝你们英勇顽强地取得更大的胜利。
    全中国人民的心都和你们紧结在一起，我们已向使馆表示了自己的态度，一旦祖国需要，便回到祖国，和你们一齐站到斗争的最前线，并肩打击敌人。现在，我们要更加努力地学习建设祖国的本领，使我国的科学更快的赶上世界水平。苏联莫斯科大学中国留学生
