　　The Secretary Sleeps by the Furnace:
　　One Furnace Ignites, Ten Thousand Furnaces Glow Red

　　(Our Nanjing, September 2nd dispatch) Reporter Zhang Jing reports: "Day and night spent by the furnace, cultivating fields of steel production; one furnace ignites, ten thousand furnaces glow red, molten iron flows like a river." This is the song of leading cadres at all levels in Jiangsu Province fighting for steel. Recently, they have been carrying their bedding, setting up tents near the furnaces, eating and sleeping there, and fighting alongside the workers. Many furnaces that weren't producing iron have now started to yield molten iron; some low-yield furnaces have achieved record outputs.

　　At the experimental furnace of Wu Zhongcun, First Secretary of the Suzhou Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, people see Secretary Wu and other cadres and workers together every day, studying furnace construction, iron smelting operations, output, quality, and labor organization. From the very beginning, they put forward the goal of "safe production with good quality, output surpassing foreign blast furnaces; careful maintenance of the furnace and meticulous operation, lifespan exceeding that of a venerable elder." After the experimental furnace was put into production on August 24th, the output remained at around 600 jin. Secretary Wu and the staff analyzed the reasons for the low output in detail, deciding to make the ore pieces uniform in size, dry the damp ore, and take other measures. By August 29th, the output of this 0.18 cubic meter experimental furnace had risen to 805 jin, with a furnace utilization coefficient of 0.447, setting a new national record for the utilization coefficient of native blast furnaces. On August 30th, the Municipal Party Committee held an on-site meeting next to this experimental furnace to exchange iron smelting experiences. The representatives from more than 200 units who attended were greatly inspired and resolved to ensure that all native blast furnaces in the city would achieve longevity and high yield.

　　In Wuxi City, from the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee to the leading cadres at all levels, have been tirelessly fighting by the furnace day after day. Zhang Bosheng, director of the Red Flag Steel Factory, and Liu Qun, the party branch secretary, led three employees in charge of building the city's first three-cubic-meter blast furnace. They dug firebricks from a depth of one person underground, ran all over the city and countryside to find raw materials during the day, and built and lined the furnace themselves at night. When the furnace was ready for baking, the ignition fuel could not be loaded. Zhang Bosheng was the first to climb onto the charging platform and lowered himself in with a rope to lay the materials. He persisted in the furnace, where the temperature reached two or three hundred degrees, for a whole hour. Later, he took turns going down three or four more times with others. Unfortunately, the furnace broke down after producing the first batch of iron. He immediately swung a twelve-pound hammer and joined everyone in rescuing it. When the tapping hole was opened, a burst of red iron sparks shot out, splashing onto Director Zhang, who was closest to the furnace. His undershirt was burned, and his hands and feet were scalded, but he didn't say a word. He said to his companions, "To be a steel warrior, you must have the courage of steel!" In this way, they worked hard and diligently for eight days and eight nights, enabling this furnace to continuously produce iron for fifteen days and nights, becoming a bright red flag among the city's blast furnaces.

　　These two stories are just a microcosm of the thousands upon thousands of leading cadres fighting at the furnace. Their moving deeds can be found almost everywhere in Jiangsu Province. Their spirit of tireless effort, their in-depth and practical approach to technology, and their selfless communist qualities not only powerfully inspired the enthusiasm of the masses but also created many good experiences in production technology, promoting the normal production of a large number of small blast furnaces. In recent days, the daily output of pig iron in the province has more than doubled compared to before.

### 书记睡到炉边去  一炉升火万炉红

　　书记睡到炉边去
　　一炉升火万炉红
    本报南京2日电　记者张竞报道：“昼夜不分在炉边，种出钢铁丰产田；一炉升火万炉红，滚滚铁水汇江流。”这是江苏省各级领导干部为钢铁而战的歌声。近日来，他们纷纷背了铺盖，到炉边搭篷落户，吃在炉旁，睡在炉边，和工人一齐战斗在炉边。许多不出铁的炉子，因而吐出了铁水；有些低产的炉子创造了高产纪录。
    在中共苏州市委第一书记吴仲村的试验炉边，人们每天都看到吴书记和干部、工人在一齐，研究建炉、炼铁操作、产量、质量和劳动力组织等问题。他们在一开始就提出了“生产安全质量好，产量赛过洋高炉；保养炉子细操作，寿命胜过老寿星”的奋斗目标。试验炉在8月24日投入生产以后，产量一直停留在六百斤左右。吴书记就和职工们详细分析了产量不高的原因，决定把矿石敲得大小均匀，将潮湿的矿石烘干，同时采取了其他的措施。到8月29日，这个零点一八立方公尺的试验炉，产量就上升到八百零五斤，高炉利用系数为零点四四七，创造了全国土高炉利用系数新纪录。8月30日，市委就在这座试验炉边召开了交流炼铁经验的现场会，到会的二百多单位的代表，都得到很大启发，决心让全市的土高炉做到长寿高产。
    在无锡市，从市委第一书记一直到各级领导干部，连日来都不辞辛劳地在炉边奋战。红旗钢铁厂的厂长张伯生和党支部书记刘群，带领了三个职工，负责新建全市第一个三立方公尺的高炉。他们在一人深的地下挖出了耐火砖，白天跑遍城乡找原材料，夜里又自己砌炉、搪炉。炉烘好了，引火燃料装不进去，张伯生便第一个爬上料台，用绳子把自己吊进去铺料。在温度达二三百度的炉子里，整整坚持了一个钟头；后来，他又同别人轮流下去了三、四次。不幸炉子出了第一炉铁就坏了，他又马上挥起十二磅重的鎯头和大家一齐抢救。出铁口打通了，一束红红的铁花冲出来，恰巧溅在靠炉子最近的张厂长身上。汗衫烧破了，手脚烫伤了，他也没有吭一声。他对他的伙伴们说：“做一个钢铁战士，就要有钢铁般的胆量！”就这样，他们整整苦干苦钻了八天八夜，使这个炉子连续出铁达十五昼夜之久，成了全市高炉中一面鲜明的红旗。
    这两个故事仅仅是千千万万个领导干部在炉前战斗的缩影。他们的动人事迹，在江苏全省几乎到处都可以找到。他们那种不辞辛劳，钻研技术的深入踏实的作风，奋不顾身的共产主义的高贵品质，不仅有力地鼓舞了广大群众的干劲，而且在生产技术方面创造了许多良好的经验，推动着大批小高炉走向正常生产。最近几天，全省生铁的日产量已经比以前增加了一倍多。
