Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 24th: Workers of Class A of the No. 16 open-hearth furnace in the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 2 Steel Plant produced a furnace of steel in five hours and forty minutes on the 22nd, creating a new national record for rapid steelmaking in similar large open-hearth furnaces. The smelting time of this furnace of steel was forty minutes shorter than the national record created by the No. 10 open-hearth furnace of the same plant in May this year, and the utilization coefficient reached 19.1. Due to the shortening of steelmaking time, this open-hearth furnace produced 122 tons of steel more than planned on this day.

In recent times, the production situation of the No. 16 open-hearth furnace has been very good. With the efforts of the workers, the leap forward plans for the first and middle ten days of September have been overfulfilled. In mid-September, the utilization coefficient of the open-hearth furnace reached 11.7, winning the "championship" in the plant's competition. A few days ago, all the workers in the furnace put forward the slogan "Launch satellites, catch up with Shanghai, and seize the high-yield red flag of steelmaking," and their enthusiasm for labor became even higher.

The time taken for the three furnaces of steel produced by the workers of the No. 16 open-hearth furnace on the 22nd was greatly shortened compared to the plan. On this day, with an average charge of 291 tons for the three furnaces of steel, the average smelting time was 7 hours and 15 minutes, which was nearly two hours shorter than the usual smelting time. This fact powerfully broke the worries of some people that "more charging cannot lead to faster smelting" and greatly encouraged the workers' confidence in "more charging and faster smelting." Now, the workers of this open-hearth furnace are full of energy and determined to create even higher records in the near future.

Furthermore, the staff and workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 2 Steel Plant vigorously strengthened the maintenance of the furnace body, causing the steel output in mid-September to increase sharply by 18% compared to the first ten days of the month.

The production situation of the No. 2 Steel Plant in the first ten days of September was not good enough, mainly because the furnace body maintenance work did not keep up in time while expanding the charge of the open-hearth furnace in the previous period. As a result, after a short period of output increase, the number of furnace body accidents suddenly increased, and the increased output also suddenly decreased, resulting in 5,000 tons less steel produced. All the staff and workers accepted this lesson and launched a mass furnace body maintenance campaign in mid-September. While criticizing the idea of neglecting furnace body safety, a check group was formed, headed by the Party committee secretary and the factory director, to conduct a detailed technical inspection of all parts of all the furnaces, and the problems found were written on big-character posters and posted on the open-hearth furnaces, with a deadline for resolution. All open-hearth furnaces also universally established new furnace protection systems and regularly inspected the furnace body. Through the efforts of the staff and workers, the time for repairing the furnace walls and refining the furnace bottom in mid-September was reduced by 1.5% to 2.9% compared to the first ten days of the month, which greatly increased the effective working time of the open-hearth furnace and created favorable conditions for increasing steel production.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 24th: Chongqing steel workers are rising up to catch up with the advanced steel plants in the country, and their production level is rapidly rising. Since the 20th, all steel plants have continuously created new production records and have begun to reverse the situation in which the production plan for the first half of the month was not well completed.

The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company organized high-yield days throughout the company starting from September 20. In the past few days, the workshops have organized workers to attack the key problem of high sulfur in pig iron and carried out rapid steelmaking competitions, breaking through the biggest difficulty of long smelting times. The smelting time of each furnace of steel has been shortened to more than five hours, and records of 4 minutes and 43 seconds, 4 minutes and 39 seconds, and 4 minutes and 21 seconds for smelting one furnace have been continuously created. In the four days from the 20th to the 23rd, the average daily steel output increased by more than 20% compared to the first half of the month, and the utilization coefficient of the open-hearth furnace increased from 9 to more than 12. On the 22nd, the No. 1 and No. 2 open-hearth furnaces also created new records of 13.031 and 13.63, respectively.

The changes in the ironmaking workshop of this company have been even greater since the second half of September. The No. 1 blast furnace has increased sharply from the past daily production of about 160 tons of pig iron to more than 200 tons, and the No. 2 blast furnace has also leaped from 80-90 tons to 120 tons.

After the newly built open-hearth furnace of the Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant was put into production in August, the small transportation capacity behind the furnace seriously limited the performance of the open-hearth furnace's production capacity. In mid-September, the Party committee secretary, the factory director, and all the cadres of the plant were mobilized to eliminate the two "steel mountains" accumulated behind the furnace. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Tianchao Coal Mine, and other related units generously supported the installation of cranes, locomotives, and other equipment, which greatly eased the tense situation behind the furnace and created conditions for production. Starting in late September, the smelting time in the steelmaking workshop was shortened rapidly, and the daily output increased rapidly. On the 22nd, the average smelting time for each furnace of steel reached four hours and three minutes, which was nearly two hours shorter than in the past. In the four days from the 20th to the 23rd of September, the average daily steel output increased by 50% compared to the first half of the month.

    鞍钢竖红旗  创大平炉快速炼钢新纪录
    重钢追先进  日产量比上半月增20％多
    新华社鞍山24日电  鞍钢第二炼钢厂十六号平炉甲班工人22日用五小时四十分钟炼出了一炉钢，创造了全国同类大型平炉快速炼钢的最新纪录。这一炉钢的冶炼时间，比这个厂十号平炉今年5月间创造的全国纪录缩短了四十分钟，利用系数达到了十九点一。由于炼钢时间缩短，这一天这座平炉比计划多产了一百二十二吨钢。
    最近一个时期，十六号平炉生产情况一直很好，在工人们的努力下，9月上中两旬的跃进计划都超额完成了。中旬，平炉利用系数达到十一点七，获得全厂竞赛“冠军”。前几天，全炉工人提出了“放卫星，赶上海，把炼钢高产红旗夺过来”的口号，劳动热情越发高昂。
    十六号平炉工人22日炼出的三炉钢，所用时间都比计划大大缩短。这一天在三炉钢平均装入量达到二百九十一吨的情况下，冶炼时间平均是七点十五分钟，比通常的冶炼时间缩短了将近两个小时。这一事实，有力地打破了一部分人的“多装不能快炼”的顾虑，大大鼓舞了工人们“多装快炼”的信心。现在，这座平炉的工人们干劲冲天，决心在最近期间内再创更高的纪录。
    又讯  鞍钢第二炼钢厂职工，大力加强炉体维护工作，使9月中旬的钢产量比上旬猛增18％。
    第二炼钢厂9月上旬的生产情况不够好，主要是由于前一时期在扩大平炉装入量的同时，炉体维护工作没有及时跟上，因而在产量上升一个短时期后，炉体事故突然增加，已提高上来的产量也突然下降，就少产钢五千吨之多。全厂职工接受这个教训，在中旬开展了一个群众性的炉体维护运动，在批判忽视炉体安全思想的同时，由党委书记、厂长挂帅，组成检查组，对所有的炉子的各个部分，从技术上作了细致的检查，并把检查出来的问题，写成大字报贴在平炉上，限期加以解决。各平炉并普遍建立了新的护炉制度，并定期对炉体进行检查。经过职工们的努力，中旬修补炉墙和炼炉底的时间，比上旬减少了1.5％到2.9％，使平炉有效作业时间大大增加，为增产钢创造了有利条件。
    据新华社重庆24日电  重庆钢铁工人奋起追赶全国先进钢铁厂，生产水平急速上升。20日以来，各钢铁厂连续不断创造生产新纪录，开始扭转了上半个月生产计划完成得不好的局面。
    重庆钢铁公司从9月20日起在全公司组织了高产日。这几天车间组织工人猛攻生铁硫高的关键和开展快速炼钢竞赛，突破了冶炼时间长的最大难关，每炉钢的冶炼时间已缩短到五小时多，并且连续创造了四点四十三分、四点三十九分、四点二十一分炼一炉的纪录。从20日到23日的四天中，钢的平均日产量比上半月提高了20％以上，平炉利用系数从九提高到十二以上，22日一、二号平炉还分别创造了一三点○三一和一三点六三的新纪录。
    这个公司的炼铁车间从9月下半月以来变化更大。一号高炉从过去日产生铁一百六十吨左右猛增到二百吨以上，二号高炉也从八、九十吨跃进到一百二十吨。
    重庆第三钢铁厂新建平炉在8月份投入生产以后，因为炉后运输能力小，严重地限制了平炉生产能力的发挥。9月中旬，这个厂的党委书记、厂长和全厂干部都动员起来，突击消灭了炉后堆积起来的两座“钢山”；重庆钢铁公司、天巢煤矿等有关单位又慷慨支援了行车、火车头等设备，使炉后紧张状况大大缓和下来，为生产创造了条件。9月下旬开始，炼钢车间冶炼时间缩短得很快，日产量迅速上升。22日，每炉钢的冶炼时间平均已达到四小时零三分钟，比过去缩短了将近两小时。从9月20日到23日的四天中，钢的平均日产量比上半月增加了50％。
