Xinhua News Agency, 18th: On September 18th, six American warships invaded our territorial waters in the Fujian area six times. Specifically, at 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM, two American warships twice invaded our territorial waters in the Jinmen (Quemoy) and Xiamen (Amoy) areas. At 2:18 PM, one American warship invaded our territorial waters in the Baiquan (White Dog) area. At 4:00 PM, one American warship invaded our territorial waters in the Zhenhai-Dongding area. At 6:48 PM, one American warship invaded our territorial waters in the Pingtan area. At 7:25 PM, one American warship invaded our territorial waters in the Jinmen (Quemoy) and Xiamen (Amoy) areas. A spokesman for our Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated under instruction: Since the Sino-US ambassadorial talks in Warsaw began, American warships have approached our territorial waters in the Jinmen (Quemoy) and Xiamen (Amoy) areas on the 15th, 16th, and 17th, attempting to provoke incidents. Today (18th), they have intensified their actions by penetrating our territorial waters in the Fujian area six times. This is a serious military provocation that disregards our government's repeated warnings and the ongoing Sino-US ambassadorial talks in Warsaw. The Chinese government hereby issues its sixth serious warning regarding this matter.

Our brave air force immediately took off to intercept them, shooting down one and damaging one Chiang Kai-shek F84 aircraft.
