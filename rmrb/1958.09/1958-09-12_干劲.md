    Iron and steel workers are heroes,
    Their drive is higher than the sky,
    They sleep later than the moon,
    They rise earlier than the sun,
    Molten iron flows endlessly,
    Heroes of today are numerous.

    干劲
    炼铁工人是英豪，
    干劲比天高，
    比月亮睡得迟，
    比太阳起得早，
    铁水长流永不断，
    英雄人物数今朝。
