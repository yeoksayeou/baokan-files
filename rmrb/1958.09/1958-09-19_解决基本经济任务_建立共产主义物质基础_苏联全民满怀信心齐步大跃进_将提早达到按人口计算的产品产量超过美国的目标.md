Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 18th (by our correspondent Li Nan): The Soviet people are realizing a fundamental economic task with a spirit of great leap forward, which is to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist country, the United States, in terms of per capita product output. This fundamental task, with its clear goal and distinct slogan, has become an economic and political mobilizing force.

Since the 20th Congress of the CPSU put forward the task of surpassing developed capitalist countries in the shortest historical period in terms of per capita product output, the shortest historical period was first clarified on the agricultural front. Major agricultural products such as meat, milk, and fats are to catch up with and surpass the United States on a per capita basis during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period (1956-1960). Moreover, some products, such as dairy products, will not even require five years.

The timeframe for surpassing the United States in industrial products was subsequently specified. The initial proposal was to surpass the United States in the absolute output of industrial products within fifteen years. However, during the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in March of this year, the Soviet Union explicitly proposed to catch up with and surpass the United States in the per capita output of the most important products within the next fifteen years. At the completion ceremony of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station in August of this year, Comrade Khrushchev called on the Soviet people to seize the time and strive to gain ten to fifteen years. This proposal naturally refers to solving the basic economic tasks of the Soviet Union within this period.

Taking a Series of Major Measures in All Aspects

In order to solve the basic economic tasks and build the material basis of communism, the Soviet Union has taken a series of major measures in terms of industrial and agricultural production, people's lives, and rules and regulations. These measures proceed from reality, break with conventions, and meet the wishes and needs of the people.

For example, the Soviet Union reorganized the management of industry and construction last year, establishing more than one hundred economic regions. This year, it reorganized the machine tractor stations and handed over agricultural machinery to the collective farms for direct control and use. These two major measures have powerfully stimulated the enthusiasm of local and industrial and agricultural workers and greatly accelerated the development of production.

The Soviet Union has also revised old rules and regulations such as the planning system and the procurement system for agricultural products that are no longer suitable for the current situation, reorganized trade union work, expanded the role of production meetings in industrial enterprises, and the power of workers to manage production. In trade, a method of public supervision of business operations has been implemented. The past model regulations for collective farms are no longer adapted to the current needs of the economic development of the collective farms and therefore are being thoroughly revised.

Heavy Industry Takes Steel as the Key

In heavy industry, the Soviet Union is currently focusing on key areas such as steel, electricity, fuel, and the chemical industry. Accelerating the development of these industrial sectors can accelerate the solution of the basic economic tasks of the Soviet Union. For example, accelerating the development of the chemical industry can both guarantee the promotion of other light and heavy industrial sectors and agriculture, as well as innovate technology, improve productivity, and open up sources of raw materials, thereby driving many production sectors to catch up with the United States in a very short time.

Light Industry Advances on All Fronts

In light industry and people's lives, the Soviet Union has taken successive measures to solve the housing problem in ten to twelve years, to double cotton production in more than ten years, and to make the production of shoes, socks, clothing, furniture, etc., abundant in five years, demonstrating a vigorous spirit of advancing on all fronts and taking off in a great leap forward.

In coordination with the leap forward in production, the Soviet Union's education and scientific research work are also being rapidly improved. Many scientific research institutions have been decentralized to the local level. The scope of labor education has deepened. Recently, preparations are being made to comprehensively reform the primary and secondary school education system.

Focusing on Improving Technology and Increasing Productivity

Among various measures, the Soviet Union has particularly grasped the important link of technological progress and increasing labor productivity in recent years. Recently, the Soviet Union proposed automation and complete mechanization as the general policy for further improving the level of production technology in the future, which will push technological innovation to a climax.

The Soviet Union has waged a resolute struggle against waste in construction work in recent years, and has increasingly widely used industrialization methods to build new industrial enterprises, and established thirty-eight model construction enterprises using pre-assembly methods. The Soviet Union has decided to focus on the construction of thermal power plants in the coming period in order to shorten the construction period of power stations. These all show that the Soviet Union is constantly seeking all possibilities to speed up the pace of construction.

The People Are in High Spirits, with Frequent Reports of Victory

The Soviet people are facing magnificent construction tasks, and they are in high spirits, determined to complete the historically significant basic economic tasks in a shorter time than planned. Since the beginning of this year, there have been frequent reports of victory from the industrial and agricultural production fronts in the Soviet Union. In the first half of this year, the Soviet Union's total industrial output increased by 10.5% compared with the same period last year. Compared with June of last year, the industrial production of the United States in June of this year decreased by about 10%, and British industrial production decreased by 5%. Due to the rapid rate of development, the Soviet Union has further approached the level of the United States in terms of per capita industrial output in the past two years. Before the October Revolution, Russia's per capita industrial output was less than one-twentieth of that of the United States, but now the distance between the Soviet Union and the United States in this regard is getting smaller and smaller. In 1956, the United States' per capita industrial output was 1.6 times more than that of the Soviet Union, while last year it was only 1.4 times more than that of the Soviet Union, which means that the difference between the two countries in this regard narrowed by 0.2 in one year. If the difference narrows by an average of 0.2 each year, then it will not take many years for the Soviet Union to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of industrial economic level. Moreover, the United States is now facing an economic crisis.

Grain, Milk, and Meat Production Greatly Increased

In agriculture, this year's harvest in the Soviet Union will exceed the unprecedentedly abundant harvest of 1956. The output of milk and meat has also increased greatly, and many states and regions have already surpassed the United States in terms of per capita milk production.

The increasingly huge achievements made by the Soviet Union in developing its national economy have shocked economists in capitalist countries. More than two years ago, when the 20th Congress of the CPSU proposed the basic economic task of catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries, many foreign bourgeois economists believed that it would take about twenty years for the Soviet Union to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita industrial production level. Some even thought that it was fundamentally impossible for the Soviet Union to do this. But now, even American economists have to admit that it is no longer a distant matter for the Soviet Union to catch up with and surpass the United States in this regard.

    解决基本经济任务　建立共产主义物质基础
    苏联全民满怀信心齐步大跃进
    将提早达到按人口计算的产品产量超过美国的目标
    据新华社莫斯科18日电　本社记者李楠报道：苏联人民正以跃进的精神实现着一项基本的经济任务，这就是争取在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家美国。这一基本任务目的明确，口号鲜明，成为一种经济上的、同时也是政治上的动员力量。
    自从苏共第二十次代表大会提出了在最短的历史时期内在按人口计算的产品产量方面超过发达的资本主义国家这一任务以后，接着就在农业战线上首先把最短的历史时期明确起来。肉产品、牛奶、油脂等几项重要农产品要在第六个五年计划期间（1956—1960年）按人口平均赶上并超过美国。而且有些产品，如奶制品并不需要五年。
    工业产品方面超过美国的年限也接着具体地提了出来。最先提的是在十五年内在工业产品的绝对产量上超过美国。但是今年3月苏联最高苏维埃选举时，苏联已经明确提出按人口平均计算最重要的产品产量在最近十五年内赶上并超过美国。在今年8月古比雪夫水电站落成典礼上，赫鲁晓夫同志号召苏联人民争取时间，要赢得十年到十五年的时间。这一提法自然也是指在这段时间内解决苏联基本经济任务。
    在各个方面采取一系列重大措施
    为了解决基本的经济任务，建设共产主义的物质基础，苏联不论在工农业生产方面，在人民生活方面，在规章制度方面，都采取了一系列重大的措施。这些措施从实际出发，打破陈规，符合人民群众的愿望和需要。
    例如，苏联去年实行了工业和建筑业管理工作的改组，成立了一百多个经济区，今年又改组机器拖拉机站，把农业机器交给集体农庄直接掌握和使用。这两个重大措施有力地发挥了地方和工农业劳动者的积极性，大大加速了生产的发展。
    苏联还修改了计划制度、农产品采购制度等已经不适合当前情况的旧规章制度，改组了工会工作，扩大了工业企业中生产会议的作用和工人管理生产的权力。在贸易方面，实行了由社会公众对经营情况进行监督的办法。过去的集体农庄示范章程已经不适应当前集体农庄经济发展的需要，因此也准备作彻底的修改。
    重工业以钢铁等为纲
    在重工业方面，苏联目前抓着钢铁、电力、燃料和化学工业等几条主要的纲。加速发展这几个工业部门，可以加速解决苏联的基本经济任务。例如，加速发展化学工业既能保证促进其他轻重工业部门和农业的发展，又能革新技术，提高生产力，开辟原料来源，从而在很短的时间内带动许多生产部门赶上美国。
    轻工业各方面并举
    在轻工业和人民生活方面，苏联接连采取措施要在十年到十二年时间解决住宅问题，要在十年多时间内使棉花增产一倍，要在五年时间内使鞋袜、服装、家具等生产充裕，大有各方面并举、展翅跃进之概。
    配合生产跃进，苏联的教育和科学研究工作也在迅速改进。许多科学研究机构纷纷下放到地方。劳动教育的范围更加深入。最近还准备将中小学教育制度作全面改革。
    着重改进技术提高生产率
    在各种措施中，苏联几年来又特别抓住了技术进步和提高劳动生产率这一重要环节。最近苏联提出自动化和全面机械化作为今后进一步提高生产技术水平的总方针，这将把技术革新推向高峰。
    苏联最近几年内对建筑工作中的浪费现象作了坚决的斗争，并且越来越广泛地用工业化方法建设新的工业企业，建立了三十八个用预装配方法进行建筑的示范性建筑企业。苏联决定在今后一个时期着重建设火力发电站，以缩短电力站建设的期限。这些都说明，苏联不断在寻求一切可能来加快建设的速度。
    人民斗志昂扬频传捷报
    苏联人民面临着雄伟的建设任务，他们斗志昂扬，决心用比计划更短的时间来完成有历史意义的基本经济任务。今年年初以来，苏联工农业生产战线上频频传来捷报。今年上半年，苏联工业总产量比去年同期增加了10.5％。而与去年6月份比较，今年6月份美国的工业生产却下降了约10％，英国工业生产下降了5％。由于发展速度快，最近两年苏联在按人口平均计算的工业产量方面进一步接近美国的水平。十月革命以前，俄国按人口计算的工业产量还占不到美国的二十分之一，而现在苏美两国在这方面的距离已经越来越小。1956年，美国按人口计算的工业产量比苏联多一点六倍，而去年就只比苏联多一点四倍，也就是说两国之间在这方面的差额一年之间就缩小了零点二。如果每年平均都缩小零点二，那么苏联用不了多少年就可以在工业经济水平上赶上和超过美国。何况美国现在正面临着经济危机呢。
    谷物牛奶肉类大大增产
    在农业方面，今年苏联农业的收成将超过空前丰收的1956年。牛奶和肉类的产量也大大增加了，现在已经有许多州和区在按人口计算的牛奶产量方面超过了美国。
    苏联在发展国民经济方面所取得的日益巨大的成就，使资本主义国家的经济学家感到震惊。两年多以前，当苏共第二十次代表大会提出赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家的基本经济任务时，国外许多资产阶级经济学家认为，苏联要在按人口计算的工业生产水平上赶上美国大约得要二十年。有人甚至认为苏联根本不可能作到这一点。而现在就连美国的经济学家也不得不承认，苏联在这方面赶上和超过美国已经不再是遥远的事了。
