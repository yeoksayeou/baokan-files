　　Let the New Furnaces Join the Battle Early

    In order to ensure the overfulfillment of the 10.7 million-ton steel target, in addition to concentrating efforts on steel production, it is also of utmost urgency to complete the construction and expansion of open-hearth furnaces, converters, and blast furnaces ahead of schedule and put them into production quickly.
    Currently, the capital construction projects of the steel industry in many regions have started ahead of schedule, and some projects have been completed and put into production. However, there are also many regions where steel capital construction projects will not be completed until November or December. It is truly "the sunset is infinitely good, but it is only near dusk," with late commissioning, unable to quickly exert its role. Therefore, accelerating the construction speed as much as possible and striving to complete the projects ahead of schedule is a problem that urgently needs to be solved in the current capital construction.
    To ensure the early completion of key projects, it is necessary to concentrate manpower and material resources, and first ensure the early completion of newly built and expanded open-hearth furnaces, converters, and blast furnaces, and put them into production. In the use of funds, priority should be given to ensuring the completion of steel capital construction tasks, and funds should not be distributed equally. In the production of equipment, priority should also be given to the production of metallurgical equipment. Other aspects, such as the supply of raw materials, the allocation of design and construction forces, must also first ensure the key points. Some non-key projects can be appropriately suspended, postponed, or lower their requirements according to the actual situation and priorities. In order to ensure the early completion of steel capital construction projects, Tianjin Municipality conducted in-depth political and ideological work among its workers, appropriately tightened some capital construction projects, and the people of the city went all out to ensure the early completion of the expansion projects of Tianjin Steel Plant and other units. The valuable part of this approach is that it starts from the overall situation, grasps the key points, and provides a reliable guarantee for the increase in steel production.
    Perhaps some people will ask: Will this slow down the speed of construction? On the contrary, this will inevitably accelerate the speed of construction. Because concentrating efforts and ensuring the key points, after the key projects are completed early, more steel can be produced, which guarantees the raw materials, machinery, and equipment for general capital construction projects, thus greatly accelerating the speed. On the contrary, the approach of not distinguishing between primary and secondary, regardless of key points and general points, and doing everything at once will inevitably lead to the opposite result, failing to guarantee the key points or drive the general.
    Whether or not we can grasp the key points is essentially a question of whether or not we can grasp the main contradiction. Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us to be good at grasping the main contradiction, and if we grasp the main contradiction, other contradictions can be easily solved. Leaders in various regions should be good at planning the overall situation, distinguishing priorities and urgencies, determining the focus of work, and grasping it firmly to drive the general. This is a leadership art. Now, there are still one hundred and seventeen days left until the end of the year, and every minute and every second is very precious to us. We must firmly grasp the central link of the steel industry, so that the capital construction projects of the steel industry can be put into production earlier and participate more quickly in the ranks of fighting for the completion of 10.7 million tons of steel.

　　让新炉子早日参战

    为了保证超额完成一千零七十万吨钢的任务，除了集中力量抓钢铁的生产以外，如何使新建、扩建的平炉、转炉和高炉提前完工、迅速投入生产，也有着极其迫切的意义。
    目前，许多地区钢铁工业的基建工程已经提前上马，有些工程已经完工，并投入生产。但是，也有不少地区的钢铁基建工程要等到11月12月才能完工，真是所谓“夕阳无限好，只是近黄昏”，投入生产晚，不能迅速发挥它的作用。因此，尽可能加快建设速度，力争提前完工，是当前基本建设中亟待解决的问题。
    要保证重点工程提前完工，就必须集中人力物力，首先保证新建、扩建的平炉、转炉和高炉等提前完工，并投入生产。在资金的使用上，应当首先保证钢铁基建任务的完成，不能平均分配。在设备的生产上，也应当首先保证冶金设备的生产。其他如原材料的供应，设计、施工力量的调配等方面，都必须首先保证重点。一些非重点的项目，可以根据实际情况分别轻重缓急，适当停车让路、推后或降低自己的要求。天津市为了保证钢铁基本建设工程提前完工，在职工中进行了深入的政治思想工作以后，适当紧缩了一部分基建项目，全市人民全力以赴，为保证天津钢厂等单位扩建工程提前完工而奋战。这种作法可贵之处就在于它从全局出发，抓住了重点，给钢铁工业的增产提供了可靠的保证。
    也许有人会问：这样做是不是放慢了建设的速度？恰恰相反，这样做必然会加快建设速度。因为集中力量，保证了重点，重点的工程提早完工以后，就可以生产更多的钢铁，使一般的基建项目的原材料、机器设备等得到了保证，这样，就可以大大加快速度。相反地，那种不分主次，不管重点与一般，齐头并进，眉毛胡子一把抓的做法，势必造成欲速则不达，既不能保证重点，也不能带动一般。
    能不能抓住重点，实质上就是能不能抓住主要矛盾的问题。毛泽东同志经常教导我们要善于抓住主要矛盾，抓住了主要矛盾，其他矛盾就可以迎刃而解。各地区的领导人员要善于统筹全局，分清轻重缓急，决定工作重心，紧紧地抓住不放，以带动一般。这是一种领导艺术。现在，离年底还有一百一十七天，每分钟、每秒钟对我们都是十分宝贵的。我们必须紧紧抓住钢铁工业这一中心环节，使钢铁工业的基建项目提早投入生产，更快地参加到为完成一千零七十万吨钢而奋战的行列里来。
