Xinhua News Agency, London, 8th September: The British Labour Party today issued a statement on the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait region provoked by the United States, saying that it is very clear that British public opinion would not support a war waged by the United States to protect Chiang Kai-shek's continued occupation of China's coastal islands.

The statement, issued by Labour Party Secretary Phillips on behalf of the Labour Party National Executive Committee after consulting with Labour Party leader Gaitskell, stated that the Labour Party National Executive Committee was "deeply concerned" about the dangerous situation caused by the "issue of the ownership" of China's coastal islands. The statement said that former Conservative Prime Minister Eden had pointed out in the House of Commons in 1955 that "we have always considered the coastal islands to be part of China." The statement said: "That is the case, and it is logical that they should belong to the Beijing government. The (Labour Party) National Executive Committee clearly expressed this view on February 23, 1955, when it called on the government to 'make it clear to the United States government that Britain cannot be expected to provide any military assistance in the conflict relating to the coastal islands, and call on the government to influence the United States to withdraw the Kuomintang troops from these islands.'"

The Labour Party statement also welcomed China's proposal to hold Sino-US ambassadorial talks to discuss the tense situation in the Taiwan region, and expressed "regret" at the British Foreign Office's statement defending the United States' provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait.

The Labour Party statement also said: "The admission of Beijing representatives to the United Nations is an indispensable part of resolving the Far East problem."

At the same time, the Labour Party's statement ignored China's sacred and inviolable sovereignty over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and actually advocated that China's territory, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, should be "neutralized through international guarantees and placed under the protection and administration of the United Nations."

　　英国工党反对美国向我国挑衅
　　发表声明指出沿海岛屿是我国的一部分
　　但又主张对台湾和澎湖实行所谓中立化
    新华社伦敦8日电　英国工党今天就美国在台湾海峡地区挑起的紧张局势发表声明说，非常清楚，英国舆论不会支持美国为了保护蒋介石继续盘踞中国沿海的岛屿而进行的战争。
    工党书记菲利普斯在同工党领袖盖茨克尔会商后代表工党全国执行委员会发表的这项声明表示，工党全国执行委员会对因为中国沿海岛屿的“归属问题”而引起的危险局势“深为担心”。声明说，保守党前首相艾登在1955年就曾经在下院指出，“我们一向认为沿海岛屿是中国的一部分”。声明说：“情况就是这样，它们应当归北京政府所有，这是合乎逻辑的。（工党）全国执行委员会在1955年2月23日也清楚地表示了这个意见，那时候它呼吁政府‘向美国政府清楚说明不能在关系到沿海岛屿的冲突中指望英国在军事方面的任何帮助，并且呼吁政府影响美国，使国民党军队从这些岛屿撤退。’”
    工党的声明还表示欢迎中国提出的举行中美大使级会谈讨论台湾地区紧张局势的建议，并且对英国外交部为美国在台湾海峡的挑衅行动辩解的声明表示“遗憾”。
    工党在声明中还说：“接纳北京代表进入联合国是解决远东问题的不可缺少的部分。”
    同时，工党的声明却无视中国对台湾和澎湖列岛的神圣不可侵犯的主权，竟主张把中国的领土台湾和澎湖列岛通过所谓“国际担保而加以中立化，并且置于联合国的保护和管理之下”。
