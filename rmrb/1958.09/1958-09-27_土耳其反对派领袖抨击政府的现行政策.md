Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, September 25th, TASS: Turkish opposition leader, Chairman of the Republican People's Party, and former President of the Turkish Republic, Inonu, criticized the current Turkish government's domestic economic policies at a press conference on the 24th. He also pointed out that there is no freedom of the press, sound electoral system, or impartial judicial system in Turkey. He said that this responsibility should be entirely borne by the Turkish Prime Minister and Chairman of the ruling Democratic Party. Inonu said, "All far-sighted people at home and abroad believe that the current domestic system has little in common with democracy."

Inonu pointed out that the government's economic policies are unfounded. He emphasized that due to the deteriorating living conditions of the residents, Turkish Prime Minister Menderes has lost his prestige in the country. Inonu said that the country has fallen to such a point that it has to request a postponement of debt repayment.

    土耳其反对派领袖
    抨击政府的现行政策
    新华社26日讯  塔斯社安卡拉25日讯：土耳其反对派领袖、共和人民党主席、前土耳其共和国总统伊诺努24日在记者招待会上抨击土耳其现政府的国内经济政策，并且指出，土耳其国内没有出版自由、健全的选举制度和公正的司法制度。他说，这个责任应当完全由土耳其总理、执政的民主党主席负责。伊诺努说，“国内外一切有远见的人都认为，目前国内的制度很少同民主有相同之处。”
    伊诺努指出，政府的经济政策是无根据的。他强调说，由于居民生活日益恶化，土耳其总理曼德列斯在国内的威信已经扫地。伊诺努说，国家已经落到这种地步，它不得不请求延期偿付债务。
