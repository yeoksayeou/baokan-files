Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: U.S. imperialism is continuing to intensify its military deployment in the Taiwan area to threaten China with armed force. According to Western news agencies, the various American military bases in Taiwan were unusually busy today as American equipment and personnel continued to pour in.

    The U.S. invading Taiwan Command acknowledged today that the aircraft carrier "Essex," detached from the U.S. Sixth Fleet, arrived in waters off Taiwan on the 16th to reinforce the Seventh Fleet. The U.S. Seventh Fleet has now increased to six aircraft carriers. American news agencies shamelessly boast that the United States has "assembled the largest naval nuclear attack force ever assembled in the world" in the Taiwan Strait, attempting to intimidate the 600 million Chinese people. At the same time, the U.S. Marine Corps' 11th Air Group, composed of jet fighters and bombers, has invaded and stationed itself in Taiwan. A batch of F-104 jet fighters from the U.S. 83rd Air Squadron has also entered Taiwan from North America to be stationed there.

    Many signs indicate that American warmongers are actively plotting to expand their aggression and provocation against China. The Chinese people, who will never tolerate aggressors, are closely watching all military adventures of U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area.

Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: According to TASS, New York: The American ruling group is intensifying its war threats in order to intimidate China and attempt to influence the ongoing Sino-American ambassadorial talks in Warsaw.

    Retired U.S. Lieutenant General Harrison actually clamored on the 15th to "eliminate the communist artillery and airfields on the mainland." He said murderously that he "could do this with aircraft."

    According to a report from Washington by "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Marguerite Higgins, the United States has now decided to take two new measures: the first is to send a battalion of soldiers equipped with "Nike-Hercules" missiles to Taiwan; the second is to prepare to evacuate the families of American military advisors in Taiwan.

    According to Higgins, the reason for taking these two measures is to prepare so that "the United States may take the next step if it is dissatisfied with the progress of the Warsaw talks."

    The "New York Herald Tribune" also published in a prominent position an interview between its commentator Alsop and Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek even clamored that if the blockade of Kinmen continued for a long time, he would have no choice but to order his air force to attack the People's Republic of China.

    Commenting on Chiang Kai-shek's remarks, Alsop said that it was clear that whether he took this step would depend on whether the United States could force China to "cease fire" in the Warsaw talks.

    谈判代表坐下谈判  战争贩子部署
    战争华盛顿当局耍两面手法
    据新华社17日讯　美帝国主义在台湾地区继续加紧进行武装威胁中国的军事部署。据西方通讯社消息，在台湾的各个美国军事基地，今天由于美军的各种装备和人员继续涌到而显得异常忙乱。
    侵台美军司令部今天供认，由美国第六舰队抽调的航空母舰“爱塞克斯号”在16日抵达台湾海外的水面，增援第七舰队。美国第七舰队的航空母舰现在已经增加到六艘。美国通讯社无耻地吹嘘美国在台湾海峡“集结了世界上所曾经集结过的最大的海军原子核攻击力量”，妄图向六亿中国人民施加恫吓。同时，由喷气战斗机和轰炸机组成的美国海军陆战队第十一空军大队已侵驻台湾。美国第八十三空军中队的一批F—一○四式喷气机，也由北美进入台湾驻扎。
    许多迹象表明，美国战争贩子正在积极图谋扩大对中国的侵略和挑衅，对侵略者绝不姑息的中国人民，正在密切注意美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区的一切军事冒险行动。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：美国统治集团加紧进行战争威胁，以便恫吓中国，并且企图影响正在华沙举行的中美两国大使级谈判。
    已经退休了的美国中将哈里逊在15日居然叫嚣要“消灭大陆上的共产党炮兵和飞机场”。他杀气腾腾地说，他“可以用飞机做到这一点”。
    据“纽约先驱论坛报”记者玛格丽特·希金斯自华盛顿报道说，美国现在决定要采取两个新措施：第一个措施是派一营有“奈克——赫尔克里士”式导弹装备的士兵到台湾去；第二个措施是准备撤离在台湾的美国军事顾问家属。
    据希金斯说，所以要采取这两个措施，是为了作好准备，以便“美国一旦对华沙谈判的过程感到不满意，就可能采取下一步行动”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”还在显著的地位刊载了该报评论员艾尔索普同蒋介石的谈话。蒋介石居然叫嚷说，如果对金门的封锁长期继续下去，那他就不得不命令自己的空军向中华人民共和国进攻。
    艾尔索普在评论蒋介石的谈话时说，很明显，他是否采取这种步骤，将取决于美国在华沙谈判中是否能迫使中国“停火”。
