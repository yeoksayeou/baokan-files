Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A commemoration meeting for the world cultural figures, the 13th-century great Iranian poet Saadi, the 17th-century great English poet Milton, and the contemporary Swedish female writer Selma Lagerlöf (deceased), was held in Beijing on the 20th.

The commemoration meeting was sponsored by the China People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Writers Association.

Mao Dun, Standing Committee Member of the World Peace Council, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, delivered the opening speech, expressing a warm welcome to the foreign guests who were invited to participate in the commemoration meeting. He said that our commemoration of these three world cultural figures and our interest in these three cultural figures are mainly due to the humanistic ideas in their works, to their yearning for light and their hatred for darkness and ignorance. He stated that the Chinese people are willing to conduct more and broader cultural exchanges with all countries in the sense of stopping aggression and safeguarding world peace.

Zheng Zhenduo, member of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and director of the Chinese Writers Association, delivered a report at the meeting on the life and literary creation of these three world cultural figures.

Zheng Zhenduo pointed out that these poets and writers were all brilliant and wonderful sons and daughters produced by mankind. Saadi was the greatest and most important poet in 13th-century Iran, and the founder of Iranian pure lyric poetry. "The Orchard" and "The Rose Garden" are his two immortal works. John Milton was a great English poet of the 17th century, and also an active fighter and political commentator in the bourgeois revolutionary movement at that time. His three representative works: "Paradise Lost," "Paradise Regained," and "Samson Agonistes" are magnificent human "epics." Selma Lagerlöf was the greatest contemporary Swedish writer, as well as a feminist and peace warrior.

Zheng Zhenduo said that although these three writers were born in different eras and had their limitations of the times, they all had the common spirit of striving for the cause of human progress, and their works have become shining treasures in the literary treasure house of mankind, loved by the majority of readers. We can draw rich creative experience from these works.

Also present at the commemoration meeting on the Chinese side were Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, as well as Tian Han, Ye Shengtao, and more than 300 people from literary and art circles.

Foreign guests invited to attend the commemoration meeting included Japanese peace activist in Beijing, Kinkazu Saionji and his wife, Australian Writers' Association Vice Chairman,  Cusack, and foreign guests from India and other countries, as well as personnel from the Afghan and British Embassies in China.
