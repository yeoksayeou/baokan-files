Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 16th: According to a broadcast today by the "Voice of Free Lebanon" radio station, Lebanese opposition leader Saeb Salam in Beirut called on all insurgents to hold their weapons tightly, and be ready to fight at any time if the imperialists attempt to delay their stay in Lebanon.

Salam said that only the complete withdrawal of the American occupation forces from Lebanon can satisfy the opposition, and the withdrawal must be completed in a very short period of time.

According to a report in Damascus' "Al-Nour" newspaper today, the headquarters of the insurgents in Hermel and Baalbek, northeast of Beirut, wrote again to President-elect Chehab, demanding that he purge the fascists of the National Social Party who support the Chamoun group. The letter pointed out that the gang's followers are still conducting large-scale military training.

The insurgent headquarters in the region also demanded the removal of all camps and organizations of the National Social Party followers in the Bekaa Valley, otherwise the insurgents will take responsibility for eliminating the gang.

The newspaper also reported that Lebanese opposition leaders will hold a meeting in Beirut in a few days to discuss the formation of a new cabinet.

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: Beirut News: On the eve of the opening of the Thirteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States began withdrawing about 2,000 of its Marines from Lebanon on the 14th. This batch of invading troops includes a battalion that the US military authorities in Lebanon announced on September 10th would be withdrawn. It is announced that it will take several days for the United States to withdraw this batch of troops.

While withdrawing these invading troops, the United States is shipping 1,900 Marines from the US mainland to the Mediterranean as originally planned, to strengthen the US's aggressive forces around Lebanon. A spokesman for the US military in Lebanon publicly announced on the 14th that the US Sixth Fleet would "maintain an amphibious assault force of two battalions in this area."

The United States is withdrawing a batch of invading troops from Lebanon on the one hand, and rushing troops to the vicinity of Lebanon for reinforcement on the other. This practice shows that the United States continues to play tricks with troop withdrawals in an attempt to evade condemnation by world public opinion, while refusing to abandon its intention to expand its aggression at any opportunity.

While playing tricks with troop withdrawals, US paratroopers have been continuously conducting large-scale airborne exercises near Beirut Airport for days, carrying out shameless intimidation against the Lebanese people who resolutely demand the complete withdrawal of US troops. According to Agence France-Presse, after the withdrawal of 2,000 US invading troops, the United States still has 9,400 invading troops in Lebanon.

    黎反对派要美军全部撤走
    美国又玩弄撤军把戏企图逃避舆论谴责
    新华社大马士革16日电　据“自由黎巴嫩之声”电台今天广播，黎巴嫩反对派领袖萨拉姆在贝鲁特号召所有起义者紧握住武器，如果帝国主义者企图拖延呆在黎巴嫩的话，随时准备进行战斗。
    萨拉姆说，只有美国占领军全部撤出黎巴嫩才能满足反对派，撤离工作必须在非常短的时间内完成。
    另据大马士革“光明报”今天报道，贝鲁特东北面的赫迈勒和巴尔贝克的起义者总部又写信给当选总统谢哈布，要求他清除支持夏蒙集团的国家社会党法西斯党徒。信中指出，这个匪帮的党徒还在进行大规模的军事训练。
    这个地区的起义者总部还要求撤除国家社会党党徒在贝卡地区的所有的营地和组织，否则起义者将负起清除这个匪帮的责任。
    这家报纸还报道，黎巴嫩反对派领导人将在几天内在贝鲁特举行会议，讨论组织新内阁问题。
    新华社15日讯　贝鲁特消息：在联合国大会第十三届会议开幕前夕，美国14日开始从黎巴嫩撤出它的约两千名海军陆战队。撤出的这批侵略军队中有侵黎美军当局9月10日宣布要撤走的一个营。据宣布，美国要花好几天才能把这批军队撤走。
    在撤出这些侵略军队的同时，美国正按照原定计划，从美国本土赶运一千九百名海军陆战队到地中海来，以加强美国在黎巴嫩周围地区的侵略兵力。侵黎美军发言人在14日公开宣布，美国第六舰队要在这个地区“保持一支有两营兵力的两栖进攻部队”。
    美国一方面从黎巴嫩撤出一批侵略军，另一方面又赶运军队到黎巴嫩附近增援。这种做法表明，美国继续在耍撤军花招以逃避世界舆论的谴责，同时又不肯放弃伺机扩大侵略的打算。
    在耍弄撤军花招的同时，侵黎美军伞兵连日来又不断地在贝鲁特机场附近举行大规模的空降演习，向坚决要求美军全部滚出的黎巴嫩人民进行无耻的恫吓。据法新社报道，在两千名美国侵略军撤离以后，美国在黎巴嫩还留有九千四百名侵略军队。
