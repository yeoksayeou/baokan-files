Mudanjiang City is surrounded by mountains, a small plain. However, if you climb Huanghua Ridge (where the petroleum factory is located) and look out, you'll see a large plain embraced by mountains and water. Ning'an, sixty miles from Mudanjiang City, is such a place, with many paddy fields, distant mountains like dark eyebrows, resembling the scenery of southern China. Within Ning'an County is a town called Dongjing Town. This town has a big history: it was the capital of the Bohai Kingdom, which dominated the north from 700 AD to 925 AD (the Bohai Kingdom had five capitals, this being Dongjing). How vast was the territory of the Bohai Kingdom at its peak? I haven't researched it, so I can't say for sure. I've heard that it not only encompassed the Songhua River and Mudanjiang River basins but also extended far into eastern Siberia. But judging from Tang Dynasty records calling it "a large country in the eastern wilderness," it must have been very powerful. We only need to look at the richness of the mountains and rivers around today's Ning'an to imagine how the Mohe people could establish a strong country in this region one thousand two hundred years ago. Of course, absorbing the culture of the Tang Dynasty also played a significant role. Dongjing Town is surrounded by mountains, with the Mudanjiang River winding around it, and a plain in the middle, creating an open and majestic scene; there was good reason for the Bohai Kingdom to choose it as its capital.

But here, we don't need to delve into archaeology; we should look at the leading figures of today. So, let's talk about the Abao Agricultural Cooperative in Bohai Township, which will give us a glimpse.

The Abao Cooperative has a total of 309 households, with 1,443 people (including 312 male laborers and 166 female laborers), and cultivates over 586 hectares of land, of which 165 hectares are paddy fields. The cooperative has a pumping station and is planning to convert dry land into paddy fields. This year, 100 hectares have been converted, and another 100 hectares are planned for next year. By 1962, all 420 hectares can be converted into paddy fields.

The land is flat, facing the river on one side; the soil is fertile, and fishing is possible year-round. Isn't this a land of rice and fish? And it's also a land of poetry. Since the rectification campaign, this cooperative has produced perhaps thousands of poems. Just looking at those posted on the walls of the cooperative office, layered upon layered, there are quite a few, and that's only a selection. Adding the poems published in the three regular or irregular wall newspapers, "Abao Street," "Abao Youth," and "Abao Children" (all poems), the number is even more impressive. The leadership is assigning several cadres who have been sent down to the cooperative to do preliminary selection work on this large amount of poetry.

A row of houses by the roadside, clean and tidy, these are the residences of the cooperative members; the walls are the territory of "Abao Children." This wall newspaper has illustrations and poems, all the work of elementary school students. I saw such a poem:

　　Because of the General Line,
　　People's lives are like this.
　　Gathering fertilizer in the city for ten days,
　　Returning home, I don't recognize my hometown;
　　Wheat seedlings emerge green everywhere,
　　Wildflowers bloom all over the mountains.
　　Looking up, electric wires connect into a net,
　　Everywhere, I hear the victory song on the radio;
　　The mountain road outside the village leads to the highway,
　　The forest belt beside the house is like a long snake.
　　In the distance, I hear the sound of flowing water,
　　Looking closer, I realize it's a man-made river;
　　The roar of machine motors shakes the sky,
　　New-style farm tools sow the seeds.

　　Only away from the cooperative for ten days,
　　Why have there been so many changes?
　　Because of the General Line,
　　Construction speed is as fast as a shuttle.

This poem has a mature air, perhaps the result of polishing, but what it records is fact. So much change in just ten days. However, if you look at the cooperative's "Double-Anti Exhibition Room," you'll know that although the Abao Cooperative became an advanced cooperative as early as 1956, it was still only a third-class cooperative in Bohai Township in 1957. Its sudden change and leap forward are the result of the Double-Anti Movement. Therefore, the ten days of change described in this poem are only the great material harvest, and have not yet described the great ideological and political harvest, and the latter is the soul of the former.

The "Double-Anti Exhibition Room" concisely and vividly tells you that this cooperative was once dominated by evil influences and sluggishness. After the rectification campaign began, the Party grasped ideological leadership, mobilized the masses, and launched a struggle between two roads. In the great blooming and contending, the cooperative members put forward 15,000 opinions and wrote more than 200 big-character posters, finally making the entire cooperative's ideological situation completely new. The content of the "exhibition" is rich in illustrations and texts (poems). The comic strips exposing the sabotage activities and embezzlement of landlords and rich peasants are very vivid in character. The poems used as explanations are mostly concise and powerful. Some poems were composed and sung on the spot at the struggle meetings by the masses. The end of the "exhibition" is a large chart, illustrating the cooperative's five-year production plan and leap forward targets. The ideological education effect of this "exhibition" is very significant.

"Abao Street" is a wall newspaper for posting street poems, changed every three days, equivalent to Abao's general publication, while "Abao Youth" and "Abao Children" are publications for young people. These three wall newspapers all enthusiastically promote the General Line. The cooperative held a General Line propaganda study session, attended by a total of 30 people. Cadres who had been sent down helped with the work of the study session, such as explaining the basic points.

The propaganda tower is a new form of General Line propaganda and education carried out by the Abao Cooperative. This is a square tower erected in the center of the square, with a row of small red flags inserted at the top; the front of the tower is called the "More, Faster, Better, and More Economical List," its reverse side is the "Less, Slower, Worse, and More Expensive Platform," the left side is the "Zhuge Liang Platform," and the right side is the "Strive to Be Upstream Platform." Each platform (that is, each side of the tower) is posted with poems to praise or criticize the cooperative members. These are changed at any time. The masses like this propaganda form very much and regard it as the cooperative's newspaper. The poems on the propaganda platform are mostly created by the masses.

"Abao Youth" has a four-character poem written by the League branch secretary Sun Shuren (he specializes in writing four-character poems). It's only four lines, but it expresses the broad minds of today's rural youth; now I'll copy down these four lines of poetry to end this report. These four lines are:

　　Technical innovation,
　　Turning waste into gold;
　　Using both hands and brains,
　　Dedicate our youth! (End of this section, the full text is not finished)

### 北地牡丹越开越艳

专栏：

　　北地牡丹越开越艳
    牡丹江市四面环山，是一块小小的平原。然而，如果登上黄花岭（石油厂便在这里）一望，就会看到山环水抱的大块平原。离牡丹江市六十里的宁安，就是这样一个地方，水田很多，远山横黛，宛然江南风光。宁安县境内有个东京城镇，提起此镇来头大，这是公元700年到925年称雄于北方的渤海国的京城（渤海国有五个京城，此为东京）。渤海国全盛时疆域有多广？我没有作过考证，不便乱说。听人说，它不但奄有松花江、牡丹江流域，而且远及西伯利亚的东部。但看唐朝的记载称它为“东荒之大国”，想来是很强盛的。我们只看今天的宁安一带山川之利这样丰饶，便会想到一千二百年前的靺鞨族何以能在这个地区建立一个强国了。当然，吸收了唐朝的文化，也有颇大的关系。东京城镇四面环山，牡丹江左右环绕，中间一块平原，局面开敞，气势雄壮；渤海国选它为上京，是有理由的。
    但在这里，我们没有必要来考古，我们应当看看今天的风流人物。那么，就来谈谈渤海乡的阿堡农业合作社，也就可见一斑了。
    阿堡合作社共有三百零九户，一千四百四十三人（其中男劳动力三百一十二人，女劳动力一百六十六人），耕地五百八十六垧强，其中水田一百六十五垧。社有抽水站，正在有计划地把旱田改为水田，今年已改成一百垧，明年计划再改一百垧，到1962年可以全部改成水田，共四百二十垧。
    土地平坦，一面靠江；土质肥沃，常年可打渔。这不是鱼米之乡么？并且这还是诗歌之乡。整风以来，这个社生产的诗歌也许有几千首，光看合作社办公室墙上贴的，层层相叠，数目就不少，而这还只是选出来的一部分。再加上“阿堡街头”、“阿堡青年”、“阿堡少年”这三种定期或不定期的壁报所登载的（全是诗歌），数量那就更加可观了。对于这大量的诗歌，领导上正指定几个下放到该社的干部在做初步的编选工作。
    路旁一溜房子，干净整齐，这是社员们的住宅；墙上就是“阿堡少年”的地盘。这个壁报有插图，也有诗歌，全是小学生的作品。我看到这样一首诗：
    只因有了总路线，人民的生活是这样的。进城积肥十日多，归来家乡认不得；麦苗出土遍地绿，野花开放满山坡。举目电线连成网，遍闻广播胜利歌；屯外山道通公路，宅旁林带似长蛇。远处惊闻流水响，近看方知人工河；机器马达声震天，新式农具把种播。
    离社仅仅十日多，
    如此变化却为何？
    只因有了总路线，
    建设速度快如梭。
    这首诗，老成之气可掬，也许是加工的后果，但所纪却是事实。十天的变化就有这样多。可是，你如果看了这个社的“双反展览室”，就知道阿堡社虽然早在1956年就转为高级社，但到1957年，它在渤海乡还只是一个三类社，它的突变和跃进，是双反运动的结果，因而这首诗所写到的十天的变化还只是物质上的大收获，还没有写到思想上政治上的大收获，而后者又是前者的灵魂。
      “双反展览室”扼要而生动地告诉你，这个社曾经邪气当道、暮气沉沉，整风开始后，党抓紧思想领导，发动群众，展开了两条道路的斗争，在大鸣大放中，社员们提了一万五千条意见，写了二百多张大字报，终于使得全社思想情况焕然一新。“展览”内容，图文（诗）并茂。揭露地富分子破坏活动和贪污行为的连环画，人物形象都很生动。作为说明的诗，大都简明有力。有些诗，就是群众在斗争会上当场编唱的。“展览”的结尾是一幅很大的图表，说明这个社今后五年的生产计划和跃进指标。这个“展览”的思想教育作用是很大的。
    “阿堡街头”是张贴街头诗的墙报，三天一换，相当于阿堡的一般性的刊物，而“阿堡青年”和“阿堡少年”则是青少年的刊物。这三种墙报都热情地宣传总路线。这个社办过一个总路线宣传学习会，参加学习的，共三十人。下放干部帮助了这个学习会的工作，例如讲解基本要点。
    宣传塔是阿堡社进行总路线宣传教育的一种新的形式。这是搭在广场中心的四方形的一个塔，塔顶插了一溜小红旗；塔正面称为“多快好省榜”，它的反面就是“少慢差费台”，左侧是“诸葛亮台”，右侧是“力争上游台”。每台（即塔的每一面）都贴着诗歌形式的对社员进行的表扬或批评。这都是随时更换的。群众很喜欢这个宣传形式，把它当作社的报纸。宣传台上的诗歌，大都是群众创作的。
      “阿堡青年”上有团支书孙述仁写的一首四言诗（他是专写四言诗的）。只是四句，然而说出了今天农村青年的阔大的胸襟；现在我抄下这四句诗结束了这一篇报道罢。这四句是：
    技术革新，
    废铁变金；
    手脑并用，
    献出青春！（本节续完，全文未完）
