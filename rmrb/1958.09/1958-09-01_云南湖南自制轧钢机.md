Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 31st - Yunnan Province's first rolling mill with a roll diameter of 250 mm was born on the 29th.

This rolling mill weighs 60 tons and has more than 4,500 parts, including a pulley weighing 8 tons. This rolling mill can roll more than 10,000 tons of steel annually. It was manufactured by the Kunming Mining and Metallurgical Machinery Factory. This factory originally manufactured and repaired drilling rigs and other geological exploration equipment, and the machine tool equipment in the factory was small and scarce. However, after more than 20 days of hard work by all the factory workers and the collaborative support of nine factories including Kunming Iron and Steel Plant and Kunming Machine Tool Plant, the rolling mill was finally trial-produced.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 31st - Hunan Province's first self-made rolling mill has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Zhuzhou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory. This rolling mill is open type, with a roll diameter of 250 mm and a total weight of more than 40 tons. It can roll various types of steel below 80 mm, partially meeting the needs of Hunan Province's iron and steel industry development.

　　云南湖南自制轧钢机
    据新华社昆明31日电　云南省自制的第一台轧辊直径为二百五十公厘的轧钢机在29日诞生。
    这台轧钢机总重量六十吨，大小零件共四千五百多件，其中仅皮带轮就有八吨重。这台轧钢机每年能轧一万多吨钢材。它是昆明矿山冶金机械厂制造的。这个厂原来制造和修理钻机等地质勘探设备，厂内机床设备既小又少。但是，经过全厂职工二十多天苦战和昆明钢铁厂、昆明机床厂等九个工厂的协作支援，终于把轧钢机试制出来。
    新华社长沙31日电　湖南省自制的第一台轧钢机最近在株洲机车车辆修理工厂试制成功。这部轧钢机是开口式的，轧辊直径为二百五十公厘，全重四十多吨。它可以轧制八十公厘以下的各种不同的型钢，部分地满足湖南省钢铁工业发展的需要。
