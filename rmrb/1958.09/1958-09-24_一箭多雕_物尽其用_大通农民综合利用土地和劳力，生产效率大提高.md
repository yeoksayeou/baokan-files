    Killing Many Birds With One Stone, Making the Most of Everything
    Datong Peasants Comprehensively Utilize Land and Labor, Greatly Increasing Production Efficiency
    (Our Newspaper News) Our reporter Yang Liben reports: Under the guidance of the thought of building socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, the peasants of Datong County, Qinghai Province, are vigorously engaging in "killing many birds with one stone," utilizing land, tools, and labor in multiple ways to maximize their effectiveness and increase production efficiency.
    The so-called "killing many birds with one stone" means accomplishing several goals with one action, reaping multiple benefits with one investment. For example, since June, Datong County has dug a total of 52,000 fertilizer pits along the edges of fields. The location and form of these pits are chosen and designed with three uses in mind: during the fertilizer accumulation season, they serve as fertilizer pits, allowing for on-site accumulation and reducing the labor required for transportation during fertilization; during the rainy season, they act as small reservoirs, capable of accumulating water for irrigation; and they also function as soil and water conservation projects, playing a role in water storage, soil retention, and controlling soil erosion.
    Every tool is also utilized in as many ways as possible. Two hundred and fifty double-wheeled double-shared plows have been converted into wheat harvesters during the current harvest season, and eight hundred and seventy various walking plows have been converted into potato diggers. Water turbines have been universally installed next to water mills, utilizing water power to power iron smelting blowers, threshing grounds, and driving threshers, granular fertilizer manufacturing machines, and seed mixing devices.
    In terms of labor arrangement, the practices of "not going empty-handed" and "piggyback work" have become common. Whenever a task can be done incidentally, fewer or no dedicated personnel are assigned. Currently, it is the season for topdressing late crops and for fermenting green manure and storing green fodder. Commune members generally carry a load of fertilizer to the fields when going to work and bring back a cart of grass when returning. Commune members stationed in the mountains for penning and grazing also undertake the tasks of prospecting and accumulating fertilizer.
    According to the peasants of Datong County, the benefits of doing so are countless: saving labor, accomplishing more tasks, and increasing production. It is a good way to achieve "making the most of the land, making the most of the things, and making the most of the people's strength." This year, in order to control soil erosion on a mountain, the Hezhong Cooperative of Jile Township dug horizontal ditches along the mountainside and planted potatoes and broad beans in the ditches. These horizontal ditches not only controlled soil erosion over an area of 1,500 mu, but also effectively reclaimed 15 mu of arable land. The conversion of double-wheeled double-shared plows into wheat harvesters saved more than 20,000 yuan in the cost of purchasing wheat harvesters this year. Currently, the "not going empty-handed" movement of agricultural cooperative members carrying fertilizer to work and grass when returning has largely distributed the task of delivering topdressing and collecting green grass, which originally required a lot of labor, among everyone.

### 一箭多雕　物尽其用  大通农民综合利用土地和劳力，生产效率大提高

    一箭多雕　物尽其用
    大通农民综合利用土地和劳力，生产效率大提高
    本报讯　记者杨立本报道：在多快好省地建设社会主义的思想指导下，青海省大通县农民大搞“一箭多雕”，从多方面来利用土地、工具和劳力，使它们发挥最大的作用，提高生产效率。
    所谓“一箭多雕”就是办一桩事情，收几样效果，花一回本钱，得几回好处。例如大通县从6月以来在田地边上共挖了五万二千多个肥料坑，这些坑所选择的位置和挖掘的形式都是从三方面的用途来考虑的：在积肥季节是肥料坑，能就地积肥，施肥时不要花很多劳力运送；在雨季是小型蓄水池，可以积水浇地；它又是水土保持工程，起着蓄水保土、控制水土流失的作用。
    每件工具也尽可能从多方面利用。有二百五十部双轮双铧犁在目前的收割季节被改装成割麦机，八百七十部各种步犁被改装成洋芋挖刨机。水磨旁边普遍安装了水轮机，利用水力鼓风炼铁、扬场和作为动力带动脱粒机、颗粒肥料制造机、拌种器。
    在劳力的安排方面，“不空手”和“捎工”已经形成风气，凡属能够捎带做的活就不派或少派专人做现在晚田还需要追肥，又正是沤制绿肥和贮备青饲料的季节，社员们上工时普遍捎一担肥到地里，下工时捎回一车草。派驻在山上作圈放牧的社员，都兼起了找矿、积肥的任务。
    根据大通县农民的说法，这样做的好处简直没法算账，节省劳力，多办了事，增加了生产，是做到“地尽其利、物尽其用、人尽其力”的好办法。极乐乡合衷社今年为了控制一座山的水土流失，沿山挖了一道道的水平沟，在沟内种植了洋芋、蚕豆。这些水平沟不仅控制了一千五百亩面积的水土，还等于开垦了十五亩良田。双轮双铧犁改装成割麦机，今年就节省了买割麦机的钱两万多元。目前农业社社员上工捎肥、下工捎草的“不空手”运动，把原来需要许多劳力来做的送追肥和集青草，基本上由大家捎带着分担了。
