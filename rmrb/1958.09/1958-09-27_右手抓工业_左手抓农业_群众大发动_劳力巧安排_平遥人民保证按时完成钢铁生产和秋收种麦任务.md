Grasp Industry with the Right Hand, Agriculture with the Left
    Mass Mobilization, Skillful Labor Arrangement
    Pingyao People Guarantee On-Time Completion of Steel Production and Autumn Harvest Wheat Planting Tasks
    (According to Shanxi Daily) The Pingyao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party correctly implemented the spirit of the Beidaihe Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, with the First Secretary taking the lead, grasping industry with the right hand and agriculture with the left. They resolutely believed in and relied on the masses, using the great spirit of communism to break through the labor shortage, ensuring the victorious completion of steel production tasks and the on-time progress of wheat planting and autumn harvest work.
    After the steel battle began, Pingyao County, like other places, experienced an unusual labor shortage. The county has more than 80,000 male and female laborers, but steel production and agricultural production require at least 130,000 laborers in the recent month to get through it. Ensuring steel production meant neglecting wheat planting and autumn harvesting; attending to wheat planting and autumn harvesting meant being unable to guarantee steel production tasks.
    In this tense situation, the Pingyao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party steadfastly implemented the spirit of the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. On the evening of September 9, after an emergency meeting of the county committee, it put forward three combat tasks to the entire party and the entire people: not one less ton of 100,000 tons of ore must be mined, not one less mu of 350,000 mu of wheat must be planted, and not a single grain of 620,000 mu of autumn grain crops can be lost. Based on the spirit of grasping industry with the right hand and agriculture with the left, the county committee decided to immediately shift the focus of leadership from agriculture to industry. The next day, three secretaries of the secretariat, seven county committee ministers, nine section and bureau chiefs, and the first secretaries of the party committees of all six people's communes immediately set out, leading more than 18,000 strong laborers to the mountains to mine ore. At the same time, three county committee members, including the Minister of Organization, the Minister of Propaganda, and the Procurator-General, were sent to the countryside to lead autumn harvesting, deep plowing, and wheat planting work.
    Steel production was being tightly grasped, but how to solve the shortage of more than 50,000 laborers in agriculture? The county committee held another emergency meeting and put forward six emergency measures:
  (1) The power to allocate labor throughout the county will be unified under the control of the county committee secretariat to immediately eliminate the chaotic phenomenon in labor allocation. (2) In the spirit of "only by not doing some things can we do other things," a batch of county, township, and commune industries and rural water conservancy construction projects will be suspended or postponed to extract more than 10,000 laborers to strengthen the steel and agricultural fronts. The principle of labor allocation was determined: first, upward transfer; second, steel production in this county; and third, current wheat planting and autumn harvesting. All other work should be stopped or postponed as appropriate to ensure key tasks. (3) Vigorously tap the labor potential of the city. A large number of laborers were drawn from government agencies, shops, and urban residents to support steel production and agricultural production. All schools implemented half-work, half-study, and when necessary, classes were suspended for several days to participate in labor, and winter vacations were shortened at the end of the year to make up for classes. In this way, more than 50,000 laborers were dug up. (4) Reorganize the labor army. Three armies were established uniformly throughout the county: one fixed for industrial production, one fixed for agricultural production, and one mobile. According to task needs, the mobile force was dispatched by the county committee at any time; wherever there was tension, they would go there. (5) Accelerate the pace of technological revolution to effectively improve labor efficiency. (6) Implement a five-fixed management system in both industrial and agricultural production: fixed leaders, fixed tasks, fixed time, fixed work, fixed labor remuneration, strict reward and punishment system, and rapidly improve labor efficiency. With the release of emergency measures, the county committee leaders also carried out clear division of labor. Steel production and agricultural production were both led by the First Secretary. The First Secretary lived in the steel base and personally directed the steel battle. For agricultural production, the agricultural secretary and six county committee members were specially extracted to go to the six people's communes to lead wheat planting, deep plowing, and autumn harvesting work.
    In agriculture, the focus is on implementing "four combinations," "six fixings," and "large-scale cooperation." The "four combinations" are: combining manure delivery and grain transportation, combining autumn harvest and wheat planting, combining field manure accumulation and green storage, and combining autumn harvest and grass cutting; the "six fixings" are: on the basis of crop formation, fix people, fix land, fix time, fix quantity, fix quality, and fix remuneration, requiring each production team to complete the task satisfactorily in accordance with the "six fixings." "Large-scale cooperation" means that the entire county organizes the six communes into two cooperation zones according to the different maturity periods of autumn crops and the different amounts of wheat planting, unifying the scheduling of labor and animal power. Areas with less wheat planting first support areas with more wheat planting, and areas with later-maturing autumn crops first support areas with earlier-maturing autumn crops.
    As a result of the emergency measures being urgently implemented, the steel front has initially overcome five obstacles. From the front to the rear, more than 30,000 steel fighters throughout the county, after ten days of hard work, have mined more than 13,000 tons of ore, built 288 various types of native furnaces, and are building another 130. Most of the furnaces that have been built have been put into production or are about to be put into production. The agricultural front has also achieved significant results. More than 110,000 mu of the county's 620,000 mu of autumn fields have been harvested, and 90,000 mu of the planned 350,000 mu of winter wheat have been planted. The quality of wheat planting has exceeded any previous year. According to statistics from the county committee secretariat: 90% of the wheat fields have been deeply ploughed more than one foot deep and fertilized with 30,000 to 50,000 jin (including 20,000 jin of organic fertilizer), and dense planting has also been implemented, with 20 jin planted in dry land and 30 jin planted in paddy fields. In high-yield fields, some have even been deeply ploughed to four feet and fertilized with 50,000 to 60,000 jin.

    右手抓工业  左手抓农业
    群众大发动  劳力巧安排
    平遥人民保证按时完成钢铁生产和秋收种麦任务
    据山西日报消息  中共平遥县委正确贯彻党中央政治局北戴河扩大会议的精神，第一书记挂帅，右手抓工业，左手抓农业，坚决相信群众依靠群众，以共产主义的伟大气魄，攻破劳力紧张关，既保证了钢铁生产任务的胜利完成，也保证了种麦、秋收工作的按时进行。
    钢铁大战揭幕后，平遥县和其他地方一样，发生了劳动力异常紧张的现象。全县现有男女劳力八万多个，而钢铁生产和农业生产在最近一个月内，最少得十三万个劳动力才能过关。保证了钢铁生产，顾不了种麦、秋收；顾了种麦、秋收，又保证不了钢铁生产任务。
    在这种紧张的情况下，中共平遥县委坚定不移地贯彻了中央政治局扩大会议的精神，于9月9日晚上，经过县委紧急会议，向全党全民提出了三项战斗任务：十万吨矿石一斤也不能少采，三十五万亩小麦一亩也不能少种，六十二万亩秋粮作物，一颗也不能丢掉。县委根据右手抓工业、左手抓农业的精神，决定立即将领导重心由农业转向工业，第二天书记处三个书记、七个县委部长、九个科局长和全县六个人民公社的党委第一书记，立即出动，带领一万八千多名强壮的劳动力上山采矿。与此同时，又派组织部长、宣传部长、检察长等三个县委委员，到农村领导秋收、深耕、种麦工作。
    钢铁生产是被紧紧地抓起来了，但是，农业上缺五万多个劳动力，该怎么解决呢？县委又举行了紧急会议，提出了六项紧急措施：
  （一）全县劳动力调配权，统一收归县委书记处掌握，立即消除劳力调配上的混乱现象。（二）本着“有所不为才能有所为”的精神，停办与缓办一批县、乡、社的工业和农村的水利建设工程，抽出一万多个劳力，加强钢铁和农业战线。确定了劳力调配的原则：第一上调，第二本县钢铁生产，第三当前种麦与秋收。其他一切工作，该停即停，该缓即缓，以保证重点。（三）大力挖掘城市劳动潜力。从机关、商店、城市居民中抽调一大批劳力，支援钢铁生产和农业生产。所有学校，实行半工半读，必要时停课数日，参加劳动，年终缩短寒假补课。这样挖出了五万多个劳动力。（四）重新整顿劳动大军。全县统一建立三支军队，一支固定于工业生产，一支固定于农业生产，一支机动。按任务需要，机动力量由县委随时调动，哪里紧张，就到哪里。（五）加速技术革命的步伐，有效地提高劳动效率。（六）工、农业生产上都实行五固定的管理制度：固定领导人员，固定任务，固定时间，固定工种，固定劳动报酬，严明奖惩制度，迅速提高劳动效率。随着紧急措施的发布，县委领导人员也进行了明确分工。钢铁生产，农业生产都由第一书记挂帅。第一书记住在钢铁基地，亲自指挥钢铁战斗。农业生产，专抽出农业书记和六个县委委员，分赴六个人民公社，领导种麦、深耕、秋收工作。
    农业上，重点是贯彻“四结合”、“六固定”、“大协作”。“四结合”是：送粪和运粮结合、秋收和种麦结合、地头积肥和贮青结合；秋收和打草结合；“六固定”是：在作物站队的基础上，定人、定地、定时、定量、定质、定报酬，要各个生产队按照“六固定”圆满完成任务。“大协作”是：全县根据秋作物成熟期先后不同和种小麦多少不同的情况，将六个公社组织为两个协作区，统一调度劳力、畜力。种麦少的地区，先支援种麦多的地区，秋作物后熟的地区，先支援秋作物先熟的地区。
    紧急措施紧急贯彻的结果，钢铁战线上已初步闯过了五关。从前方到后方，全县三万多钢铁战斗员，经过十天苦战，采下矿石一万三千多吨，建起各种土炉二百八十八个，正在兴建的一百三十个。已建起的炉子，大部投入或即将投入生产。农业战线上成绩也很显著，全县六十二万亩秋田，已收割十一万多亩，计划种冬小麦三十五万亩，有九万多亩已经下种。种麦质量超过了以往任何一年。据县委书记处统计：90％的麦地，深耕一尺以上，施肥三至五万斤（其中有机肥二万斤），同时实行了密植，旱地下种二十斤，水地下种三十斤。丰产田，有的还深耕到四尺，施肥五至六万斤。
