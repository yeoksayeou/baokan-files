    Where Did the Old Man Go?
    Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, Qiu Niu
    Master Zhang Yungui lost his temper, grabbed his flashlight, didn't even bother with a cigarette, and hurried out with his large red oiled paper umbrella.
    "Where are you going?" His wife stopped her chopsticks, frowning.
    "The usual place!" He didn't even raise his head, and left as he spoke.
    "Sigh!..."
    Where is the usual place? It is the nearby Hongyi Teahouse. Master Zhang has a habit of sitting in the teahouse in the evening. If he doesn't hear the storyteller in the teahouse for a day, he feels like he's missing something, restless and uneasy. Anyone who knows him well knows that if you want to find him in the evening, going to Hongyi is a sure bet.
    His wife also knows how to take care of his health. Since he likes to sit in the teahouse, she lets him go.
    Since Master Zhang heard Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait, he hasn't been to Hongyi for over ten days.
    He has tasted the bitterness of American imperialism! Now that these bastards want to stop us from liberating Taiwan and ruin our happy life, Zhang Yungui grinds his teeth and his chest is filled with anger. He knows that the Dayuan vehicle he is casting directly supports the steel industry, and his group has many new trainees. Producing one more Dayuan vehicle and training a trainee one day sooner means one more force to strike at American imperialism! This time, no one can stop him from doing the work of two shifts in one.
    "He used to come back at 9:30, why is it after 10 these days?"
    When his wife asked, he vaguely replied, "Hongyi is also leaping forward, closing later..."
    It was already past ten o'clock at night. The wind blew away the clouds, and the stars peeked out one by one. At this time, two young men came to the Zhang's house covered in sweat.
    "Is Master Zhang still awake?"
    "He's at Hongyi, about to come back! Is there anything wrong?" Aunt Zhang said as she invited them to sit down.
    One young man said, "Our commando team is leaving early tomorrow morning to dig up scrap steel. Where is there a lot? We discussed it for a long time and couldn't figure it out. The team sent us to ask the old master for advice overnight. Master Zhang is a living history of this factory!"
    Another said, "We passed by Hongyi, and Hongyi was already closed!"
    "Then, then where did he go?" Aunt Zhang was angry, anxious, and thought: In order to show American imperialism what's what, people are working harder and harder, but you're spending more and more time in the teahouse!..."
    The two young men discussed it, and just as they were about to go their separate ways to find him, Master Zhang's apprentice ran up, holding Master Zhang's large red umbrella, looking angry.
    It turned out that Master Zhang had been pulled away by the young men fighting the night battle to find "ore seedlings." After Master Zhang determined the direction of the scrap steel deposits, he couldn't help but grab a pickaxe and start working himself.
    Aunt Zhang suddenly understood. She busied herself starting a fire, preparing something for her husband to eat. She also prepared a question to ask him: "You old ghost, why didn't you tell me you were doing such important things for so many days?"

    老头哪儿去了？
    重庆长安机器厂  秋牛
    张云贵老师傅丢了饭碗，揣上电筒，烟都没顾上吃，就挟着大红油纸伞匆匆出门。
    “哪去？”老伴停住筷子，皱着眉头。
    “老地方！”他连头也没抬，说着就走了。
    “唉！……”
    老地方是哪里呢？就是附近的鸿义茶馆。张师傅有一个晚上坐茶馆的习惯。一天不听茶馆那说书声，就像少点什么，坐站不宁。熟识他的人都知道，晚上要找他到鸿义去是十拿九稳。
    老伴也很知道照顾他的身体。既然他爱坐茶馆嘛，也就让他去。
    张师傅自从听了周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明后，十来天都没到鸿义去。
    美帝国主义的苦头他是吃过的！现在这龟儿子要来阻挡我们解放台湾，破坏我们的幸福生活，真叫张云贵牙根咬碎，怒火满胸。他知道自己铸造的大元车是直接支援钢铁工业的，自己小组的新学员又多，多出一部元车、早一天培养出来一个学员，就多一份打击美帝国主义的力量！这次谁也阻挡不了他一班顶两班的干。
    “以前都是九点半回来，这几天怎么要到十点多？”
    当老伴发问的时候，他就含糊地答一句：“鸿义家也跃进了嘛，关门晚了……”
    已经是夜里十点多了。风吹云散，星星一个个探出头来。这时两个青年满头大汗地来到张家。
    “张师傅还没睡吗？”
    “在鸿义，就要回来啦！有什么事吗？”张大妈一边说一边招呼他们坐。
    一个青年说：“我们突击队明天一早要出发挖废钢铁，哪里多呢？我们商量半天都弄不清，队里就派我们连夜来找老师傅请教，张老师傅是这个厂的活历史呀！”
    另一个说：“我们路过鸿义，鸿义早关门啦嘛！”
    “那，那他到哪去了？”张大妈心里是气，又是急，又想到：为了给美帝国主义点厉害看看，人干活的劲越来越大，你坐茶馆的倒越来越大了！……
    两个青年商量一下，正要分头去找，只见张师傅的徒弟挟着张师傅的大红伞，气呼呼跑来。
    原来张师傅被打夜战的青年拉去找“矿苗”去了。张师傅判定了废钢铁埋藏的方向后，自己也禁不住拿把十字镐干起来。
    张大妈恍然大悟。她忙着生火，给老伴准备点吃的。她还准备了一个问题质问他：“你这鬼老头子，为啥办正经事这么多天都不告诉我？”
