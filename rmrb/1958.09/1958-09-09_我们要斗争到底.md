We Must Fight to the End
    Ba Jin, Jin Yi
    Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait not only expresses the wishes and determination of the 600 million people, but also the urgent demands of the Taiwanese compatriots still under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times, and the Chinese people have the right to liberate their own territory at an appropriate time and in an appropriate manner, so that the people of Taiwan can return to the embrace of the motherland. Liberating Taiwan is our sacred duty, and only those who are mentally unsound and cannot distinguish right from wrong can say that this is "seizing new territory" and "endangering the security of the United States." Where is "the security of the United States"? Is Taiwan American territory inhabited by Americans? The United States is tens of thousands of miles away, but its rulers are everywhere hostile to the Chinese people, doing everything possible to "protect" that bunch of human scum, vainly attempting to create "two Chinas." If it were not for the support of US imperialism for Chiang Kai-shek, even the people of Taiwan would have the strength to kick this small group of reactionaries into the sea. US imperialism violates the will of the entire Chinese people, disregards the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world, stirs up trouble in the Taiwan Strait, interferes in China's internal affairs, and threatens peace in the Far East and the world; it not only arouses the anger of the Chinese people, but also makes itself an enemy of all peace-loving people in the world, including the vast majority of Americans who are disgusted with war. Do they want their descendants to engage in unjust wars tens of thousands of miles away from the United States, to the point of dying without a burial place?
    The Chinese people love peace, but they are not afraid of war; US imperialism should remember the severe lessons learned on the Korean battlefield and not act rashly. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people are united like a wall of bronze and iron, and industrial and agricultural production has leaped forward by leaps and bounds. Our strength is infinite. We must liberate Taiwan. If US imperialism dares to act recklessly and stubbornly, the US government must bear all the serious consequences arising therefrom. If US imperialism does not wake up and insists on armed intervention in China's internal affairs, the Chinese people are determined to completely, thoroughly, and cleanly eliminate the invaders!

　　我们要斗争到底
    巴金　靳以
    周总理对台湾海峡地区局势的声明，不仅表达了六亿人民的愿望和决心，也表达了至今仍在蒋匪帮统治下的台湾同胞的迫切的要求。自古以来台湾就是中国的领土，中国人民有权在适当的时候，采取适当的办法解放自己的领土，使台湾人民回到祖国的怀抱中。解放台湾是我们神圣的职责，只有神智不清、是非颠倒的人才能说这是“夺取新的领土”、“危及美国的安全”。“美国的安全”在哪里？难道台湾是美国的领土，住的是美国人？美国的国土在十万八千里以外，是美国的统治者处处与中国人民为敌，千方百计“保护”那一批人类的渣滓，妄想制造“两个中国”。如果不是美帝为蒋介石撑腰，就是台湾人民也有力量把这一小撮反动派踢到海里去。美帝违背全体中国人民的意志，不顾全世界爱好和平人民的愿望，在台湾海峡兴风作浪，干涉中国内政，威胁远东和世界和平；不但引起中国人民的愤怒，也与全世界爱好和平的人民为敌，那中间就包括绝大部分厌恶战争的美国人民。难道他们情愿自己的后代在远离美国千万里之外，从事不义的战争，以致死无葬身之地么？
    中国人民热爱和平，但是也不畏惧战争；美帝国主义应记取在朝鲜战场上的严厉教训，不要轻举妄动。中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，我们团结得像铜墙铁壁一样，工农业生产一跃千万里，我们的力量是无穷的。我们一定要解放台湾，美帝国主义如果胆敢不顾一切一意孤行，美国政府必须承担由此产生的一切严重后果，如果美帝国主义还不幡然醒悟，一定要武装干涉中国人民的内政，中国人民有决心全部彻底干净地消灭侵略者！
