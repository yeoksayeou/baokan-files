　　Celebrating the Harvest at the Edge of the Sputnik Field
　　Su Fang

　　A Sputnik field on the outskirts of Chengdu was surrounded by crowds of visitors. Looking at the bountiful crops, everyone couldn't stop sighing in admiration. An old professor picked up an ear of rice, looked at it from left to right, weighed it in his hand, and exclaimed, "Incredible, a miracle! A miracle!" A young girl pressed her face against the ear of rice, kissed it again and again, and smelled it; more people bent down to look at the rice stalks crowded together. Look how dense the rice stalks are, how thick the rice ears are! This heavy, light-yellow sea of rice is like a large, springy sofa; not even an egg could fall through, let alone the wind. Look how steadily those robust adults are standing on the rice ears! They seem to be standing on a thick carpet, jumping and grinning, eliciting applause from the visitors and causing the flashbulbs of the photographers to flash. A toad squatting on the edge of the field was startled by the laughter and wanted to hide in the rice field. Poor little thing, you've come to the wrong place. Can you pass through this wall formed by dense rice stalks? Sure enough, it tried to jump several times but was blocked back, making it frantically crawl around. Someone next to it gave it a helping kick, and with a "thump" it was kicked into another paddy field, splashing water everywhere. People couldn't help but laugh heartily at this scene. This is the joy of harvest!

　　In the field, the commune members were working hard, cutting and threshing. The rice grows so densely that it's hard to hold it all in your arms, making harvesting so laborious! Yesterday, more than a hundred of them spent an entire afternoon cutting only a small portion of this one mu and a little bit of crop: today, at the first light of dawn, they immediately returned to the field to toil. They kept waving their sickles and their sweat. Precious drops of labor sweat, it is you who have irrigated and nurtured such lush crops! The commune members had sweated, hoeing the ground again and again; the commune members had sweated, fertilizing the field once and then again. Do you know how difficult it is to fertilize in this dense rice field? The fertilizer simply couldn't be scattered in, so they had to dissolve the fertilizer in water, spray it on the rice with sprayers, and then flush it to the roots with water. Hard work has been rewarded with the fruits of a bountiful harvest, and today they are harvesting with such joy. A visitor greeted them, "Comrades, you must be tired!" Their answer was this: "We are so happy we can't be happier, how could we even think about being tired!"

　　Someone called out, "The chairman is here!" People immediately surrounded him, wanting him to share his experience in achieving high yields. Whether they were white-haired scholars or young and naive students, whether they were office cadres or officers and soldiers, they all took out notebooks to record. The field is the best classroom, and they are learning here wholeheartedly. They listened attentively as the chairman spoke about how the commune members learned from the advanced experiences of other places, how diligently they worked, and how they demonstrated a bold and daring communist spirit... People constantly asked this and that question, eager to hear every word and every syllable the chairman spoke, to remember it all in their hearts. People surged towards him, enthusiastically extending their hands, presenting fragrant flowers, and presenting gleaming red banners; and a group of engineering students were even more excited because they had just trial-produced a new chemical fertilizer. They planned to send several hundred jin to this agricultural cooperative, to express their admiration to the commune members, and to wish the cooperative to launch even higher yield sputniks.

　　Among the visitors were some Party branch secretaries and chairmen from neighboring cooperatives. Like everyone else, they were smiling and happily celebrating the harvest of the fraternal cooperative; but they had even more feelings in their hearts. Looking at this high-yield Sputnik field, they must have thought of the crops in their own cooperatives: the rice ears that the wind couldn't move, the cotton bolls that were so big and plump, the sorghum that was as bright and delicate red as agate... They had a secret hidden in their hearts that they didn't reveal: Visiting comrades, please come to our Sputnik field in a few days! We will prepare even more abundant gifts for you, which is called:

　　Singing throughout the five lakes and four seas,
　　How many harvest songs are sung?
　　Sputniks rush to the heavens,
　　Each one higher than the last.

　　卫星田畔庆丰收
　　苏方
    成都近郊的一块卫星田被参观的人围得水泄不通。望着这丰盛的庄稼，大家不住口地啧啧地赞叹着。一个老教授拿着一穗稻子左看右看，用手颠了又颠，连声说“了不得，奇迹！奇迹！”一个年青姑娘把脸贴到稻穗上亲了又亲，闻了又闻；更多的人都弯下身子，去看那挤在一起的稻梗。你看，稻梗长得多密，稻穗铺得多厚呀！这沉甸甸的浅黄色的稻海，像一张有弹性的大沙发，别说鸡蛋坠不下去，便是风也透不过。你看，那几个粗壮的成年人在稻穗上站得多稳！他们好像站在厚厚的地毯上，跳着，咧开嘴笑着，惹得参观的人拍手欢呼，惹得摄影记者的镁光灯直闪。一只蹲在田坎边的癞蛤蟆被欢笑声惊动了，想躲到稻田里去。可怜的小东西，你找错门路了。这密密的稻梗结成的墙，你能穿过去吗？果然它蹦了好几次都被挡回来了，急得它满地乱爬。旁边不知是谁助了它一脚之力“嘣”的一声把它踢到另外一块水田里去了，溅得水花四射。人们看到这种情景，不由得尽情地笑了起来。这是丰收的喜悦呀！
    田里，社员们正在紧张地劳动，割的割，打的打。稻子长得这么密，用手搂都搂不过来，收割起来多么费劲！昨天他们一百多人整整割了一个下午，才把这一亩零一点点的庄稼割了一小半：今天天一亮，他们立刻又到田里来奔忙了。他们不停地挥着镰刀，也不停地挥着汗水。可贵的劳动的汗珠啊，是你灌溉培育出了这样茂盛的庄稼！社员们曾经挥着汗水，把地锄了一遍又一遍；社员们曾经挥着汗水在田里施了一次肥又施一次肥。你可知道，在这密密的稻田里施肥是多么不容易呀？肥料根本撒不进去，他们不得不把肥料溶在水里，用喷雾器喷在稻子上，然后再用水冲到根部去。辛勤的劳动换来了丰收的硕果，今天他们收割得多么欢畅。一个参观者向他们慰问：“同志，你们累了！”他们的回答却是这样：“我们欢喜都欢喜不过来，哪里会想到累啊！”
    是谁叫了一声“社长来了！”人们立刻把他包围起来，要他介绍丰产经验。不论是白发苍苍的学者，或年青稚气的学生，不论是机关干部或是军官和战士，都掏出笔记本来记录。田间是最好的课堂，他们专心一意地在这儿学习起来了。他们谛听着社长讲社员怎样学习旁的地方的先进经验，怎样勤恳地劳动，怎样发挥了敢想敢做的共产主义风格……。人们不断地提出这样那样的问题，恨不得把社长讲的每一句话每一个字都听进耳朵里，都铭记在心头上。人们向他涌了上去，热情地伸出双手，献上香气馥郁的鲜花，献出红光闪闪的锦旗；而一群工学院的学生们更加振奋，因为他们刚试制出一种新的化学肥料。他们准备送几百斤给这个农业社，向社员们表示他们仰慕的心情，预祝合作社发射出更高的丰产卫星。
    在参观的人群中，有些是邻近合作社的党支部书记和社长，他们也和所有的人一样，喜笑颜开，兴高采烈地庆祝着兄弟社的丰收；然而他们心中，有着更多的感触。看着这块丰产卫星田，他们一定会想起自己社里的庄稼：那风吹不动的稻穗，那铃苞结得又大又肥的棉花，那像玛瑙一样鲜明娇红的高粱……。他们心里潜藏着一个没有吐露出来的秘密：参观的同志们啊，过几日请到我们的卫星田来看看吧！我们会给你们准备下更为丰硕的礼物，这叫做：
    五湖四海都唱遍，
    丰收歌儿唱多少？
    卫星冲上灵霄殿，
    一颗更比一颗高。
