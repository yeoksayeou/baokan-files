Sintering Workers' Lofty Aspirations
Chen Zhongguo, Worker of the Iron Smelting Workshop, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company

Following the successful conclusion of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's Technical Innovation Activists Conference, a socialist competition was launched in the sintering plant of the iron smelting workshop. The daily output of sintered ore soared like a three-stage rocket from 90 pots to 93, 99, 105, and 108 pots. In two days, the production record was improved by 75 tons of sintered ore, creating a miracle of four consecutive victories.

Clever Formation, Initial Success

The workshop foreman, Zheng Jianzhong, is a seasoned worker, meticulous despite his rough exterior, and amiable to everyone. After liberation, he attended night school and can now read newspapers and books. In his work, he is diligent, resourceful, and unafraid of difficulties. As a team leader, he excels in labor and is a skilled sintering production expert. Last year, he was elected as the vice chairman of the trade union and is also an outstanding Communist Party member. On the 17th, Foreman Zheng said to all the brothers in his team as soon as he started his night shift: "Comrades! Team Two is an advanced collective in technical innovation. We should learn from them and catch up. We must produce more sintered ore to feed the blast furnace so that it is full. Before 'July 1st', we must achieve a daily output of 200 tons of pig iron." As he said this, he took the lead and suggested changing from the previous positional warfare, where each person was responsible for their specific task, to guerrilla warfare. Previously, if there was an accident in the raw materials section, the workers on the pot-filling and pot-emptying sections would ignore it. But with guerrilla warfare, although everyone has their specific responsibility, everyone must rush to solve any accident that occurs in production. Wherever the work is tense, everyone concentrates their firepower to attack. After breaking through the key obstacles to production, they disperse again. This not only overcomes the bias of departmentalism but also highly develops the socialist collective thought of unity and fraternity. His suggestion struck a chord in the hearts of the comrades, and everyone praised it, filled with increased courage. Sure enough, after a night of fierce fighting, they finally broke through the stagnant situation of 30 pots that had persisted since June and crossed the 31-pot mark.

Catching Up Quickly, Regaining Advancement

Then there's Team Two's foreman, You Jinquan, who, although in his forties, is resourceful. Before the early shift, he came to the sintering site. He looked up and saw a large red bulletin posted on the wall, which read:

	Politics in command,
	Ideology leading the way,
	Sintering at thirty-one,
	Team One ascends the mountain.

Foreman You was stirred up the moment he saw it. He immediately gathered all the heroes of Team Two for consultation. He said, "We brothers must compete for victory in this great leap forward in production." Before he finished speaking, everyone was eager to try and offered a brilliant plan of a revolving door tactic (assembly line method), which is to divide the top and bottom of the pot into four groups according to the four pots, with five people in each group. Every time a pot is emptied, five people rest, and there is plenty of time to eat. People stop, but the machine doesn't, which is truly fast, good, and timely. After eight hours of hard work, they created a new record of 33 pots and caught up with Team One again.

Flags Flying, Moving Forward in Victory

On the 18th, just as it was getting dark, Foreman Zheng came to the workshop and saw another large-character victory report, with two paragraphs saying: Team Two catches up with Team One, sintering at thirty-three; everyone strives to be advanced, bravely competing with Wu Erlang. Team Two catches up with Team One, its vigor is unstoppable; miracles are produced, and the fighting spirit is firm and strong.

Foreman Zheng secretly praised them and admired the fearless heroism of the comrades in Team Two. Around nine o'clock, more than ten team leaders from Team One came to him. Peng Yongcai, the team leader of the raw materials section, rushed to say, "We run fast, but Team Two runs even faster. We want to discuss with you how to reach 35 pots tonight and surpass Team Two?" Seeing their high morale, Foreman Zheng was already moved by them and quickly agreed, "Okay! - Okay!" Foreman Zheng explained in detail the methods improved by Team Two and what he had learned on the spot to the team leaders, and also sought everyone's opinions. At this time, the young men from Team Two came to the material yard. When Foreman Zheng saw that they had changed into their labor insurance clothing, holding tools in their thick, iron-like arms, they looked brave and powerful. He was happy again. The three foremen conveyed the battle plan for the night and put forward a resounding slogan: "Catch up with Team Two, compete with Team Three, one person is equivalent to two, and go straight to 35 pots to be a pioneer!"

Once the assignments were made, at half past eleven, Team One took over the position of Team Three. In an instant, smoke and dust rose, and the molten iron in the sintering pot boiled, with sparks flying everywhere. The sintering workers fought bravely in the high temperature, wielding iron bars and sledgehammers. Sweat dripped like water from the eaves, and each worker's ruddy face showed a joyful smile, appearing so tenacious and heroic.

Just as everyone was working enthusiastically, suddenly, with a "click," the screen under the crushing machine tilted and stopped discharging materials. This stunned everyone. At this critical moment, Foreman Zheng rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and immediately asked, "Comrades, this is a key point. Who is willing to attack it?" Before he finished speaking, several people flashed out from the team. Foreman Zheng immediately appointed two people, one using a stick to dig in the inclined screen, and the other using manual sifting to separate dolomite and limestone. He also found two people to repair the machine parts to catch up with the raw material supply. The comrades promoted great collaboration to overcome the difficulty. By dawn, they had gone straight to 35 pots. In the third game, Team One took the lead again.

Breaking Superstition, Champion of the Three Armies

In the past two days, an unprecedentedly fierce leap forward battle has unfolded on the sintering ore site. It is truly a meeting of equals, a clash of talents, the more they fight, the braver they become, and the more they catch up, the happier they are. Red flags are flying, and war drums are thundering. The large red victory reports, congratulations, challenge letters, and response letters are crowded on the wall, one after another, and new achievements are refreshed by new records.

Let's talk about Team Three's foreman, Li Zemin, who is thirty years old, always wearing a pleasant smile on his dark red face. When he returned from the Party General Branch, he immediately gathered the activists of Team Three to discuss and seek countermeasures to catch up with Teams One and Two. Once the battle plan was set, the comrades entered the site before work, preparing the raw materials one by one and investigating the machinery and equipment to avoid work stoppages due to lack of materials during production.

At half past three, the bell rang, and Team Three took over the position and began the attack. According to the pre-arranged formation, the veteran workers guarded the main equipment to ensure the supply of raw materials, while the new workers cooperated and collaborated. The pot-emptying time for sintering ore was three minutes earlier than before, and the ignition time was two minutes earlier, and then they changed to operating with a large air flow after filling most of the pot with materials. Each pot shortened the working hours by five minutes, thus laying a favorable foundation for increasing the number of pots. Furthermore, due to the clear division of labor, the safe operation of equipment, and the unity of the top and bottom, the heroes of the raw materials section pulled the material carts back and forth like flying. At midnight, with the sound of the bell, Team Three's victory flag was planted on the main peak of 36 pots.

In just five months this year, the daily output of sintered ore has leaped from 36 pots, weighing 180 tons, and now increased to a daily output of 108 pots, weighing 540 tons, and the quality of production is the best in the country. Truly:

	Sintering workers have lofty aspirations,
	They work hard day and night;
	They fear no hundred-degree heat,
	With all their hearts to surpass England.

    烧结工人志气豪
    重庆钢铁公司炼铁车间工人　陈忠国
    重钢技术革新积极分子大会胜利闭幕后，在炼铁车间烧结场又掀起了一场社会主义竞赛，烧结矿日产量从九十锅到九十三、九十九、一百零五、一百零八锅，生产纪录像三道火箭飞跃上升，在两天内提高烧结矿产量七十五吨，连获四次大捷的奇迹。
    巧布阵势　首创奇功
    话说一班工长郑建忠，是一位粗中有细，对人和蔼的老工人。在解放后进了业余学校，现在已能看懂书报，由于平时在工作中肯干肯钻，不怕困难，任班长时劳动得顶出色，是一名烧结生产能手。去年被选为工会副主席，又是一位优秀的共产党员。17日那天，郑工长一上夜班，便对一班全体弟兄们说：“同志们！二班是技术革新先进集体，我们应向他们学习，要赶上去，我们要多产烧结矿供给高炉吃饱，在‘七一’前达到日产生铁二百吨。”说到此，他便一马当先，提了个建议，即改变过去各负专责的阵地战为游击战。原来，过去原料段生产设备有事故，锅上，锅下工段的人就坐视不理，而游击运动战，虽然各有专责，可是生产上无论何处发生事故，大家都要抢着解决，工作哪儿紧张，大家就集中火力围攻，突被阻碍生产关键后，又化整为零。这样，不但克服了本位主义的偏向，而且高度发挥了团结友爱的社会主义集体思想。他这一提，正中同志们心坎，不禁个个叫好，勇气倍增。果然经过一夜激战，终于攻破了6月份以来停滞在三十锅不能上升的沉寂状况，跨上三十一锅大关。
    猛起直追　重居先进
    再说二班工长游金泉，年虽在四十开外，却足智多谋，早班前来到烧结工地，抬眼一看，只见墙上贴着一张大红喜报，上面写道：
    政治掌帅印，
    思想当先行，
    烧结三十一，
    一班把山登。
    游工长不看还可，一看，便兴头勃起。当即召集二班众家英雄计议。他说：“咱弟兄在这场生产大跃进中，一定要见个胜负。”话未落脚，个个都磨拳擦掌，献出了一个车轮战术（流水作业法）的妙计，即锅上锅下，按四口锅子分成四个小组，每组五人，每倒一锅时就有五人休息，吃饭也有充裕的时间，人停机器不停，真是又快又好又及时。经过八小时奋战创造了三十三锅的新纪录，又赶过一班。
    旌旗招展　乘胜前进
    18日那天刚擦黑，郑工长来到车间，只见又一张大字捷报，其中有两段写的是：二班赶一班烧结三十三；人人争先进，勇赛武二郎。二班赶一班，锐气不可当；生产出奇迹，斗志坚又强。
    郑工长心里暗自叫好，对二班的同志大无畏的英雄气概感到钦佩。九点钟光景，一班的班组长十多个人来找他，原料段班长彭永才抢着说：“我们跑得快，二班跑得更快，我们想和你商量今晚来个三十五锅赶过二班如何？”郑工长见他们斗志昂扬，早被他们感动了，连忙应声“行！——行！”郑工长把二班改进的方法，和他在现场了解的情况，向班组长作了详细交代，又征求大家意见，就在这时候，二班的小伙子们来到料场，郑工长一见他们已换好劳动保险服，手持工具，粗粗的铁臂，都显得勇武有劲，他心里又是一阵高兴。三个班长传达了今夜战斗布置情况，并提出响亮的行动口号：“赶二班、赛三班，一人顶两人，直奔三十五锅当先锋！”
    分派既定，到了十一时半，一班接过三班阵地，瞬刻之间烟尘四起，烧结锅里铁水沸腾，火星四溅。烧结工人毫不在乎地战斗在高温下，舞动铁撬和大锤，汗珠像屋檐水似的直淌，每个工人红润的脸上，呈现出喜悦的笑容，显得那么顽强英勇。
    正在大伙干得热火朝天的时候，忽然卡哒一声，碎丝机下筛子斜?停止下料，这一下可把大家楞住了，正在危急之时，郑工长闻讯赶到，随即问道：“同志们，这是一个关键，哪个愿意去攻下它？”话还没有说完，只见班内闪出数人，郑工长随即指定两人，一边用棍在斜?里掏，另一边用人工分筛白云石、石灰石，又找两人修理机件，赶上原料供应，同志们大兴协作，攻打困难。在东方初晓时分已直上三十五锅。第三局结果，一班再度占先。
    破除迷信　勇冠三军
    两天来在烧结矿工地上展开一场气象空前的激烈跃进战，真是棋逢对手，将遇良才，越战越勇，越赶越欢。红旗招展，战鼓雷鸣。只见那大红喜报、祝贺、挑战书、应战书，一张紧接着一张，挤满墙头，新的成绩又被那新的纪录刷新。
    再说那三班工长李泽民年纪三十，黑里透红的脸上总是带着愉快的微笑，他从党总支部回来，立刻就召集三班积极分子商议，征求赶上一、二班的对策，战局布置既定，同志们就在上班前进入现场，将原料一一准备，又将机器设备调查一番，以免生产时发生停工待料事故。
    三时半钟声方起，三班接过阵地开始攻击，按预布阵容，老工人扼守主要设备，保证原料供应；新工人配合协作。烧结矿倒锅时间比以往提前三分钟，又提前两分钟点火，再改用装料大半锅后即放大风操作。每锅缩短工时五分钟，因而奠定了增加锅次的有利基础。又由于分工明确，设备安全运转，上下配合团结一心，原料段的英雄们拉着料车往来如飞。午夜，一声钟响，三班胜利红旗已插上三十六锅主峰。
    在今年仅仅五个月的时光里，烧结矿日产量由三十六锅，重一百八十吨，飞跃上升，现在提高到日产量一百零八锅，重五百四十吨，产质量为全国之冠。真是：
    烧结工人志气豪，
    日夜生产堪辛劳；
    百度高温无惧色，
    一心要把英国超。
