Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th: Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, inspected work in Hebei. On the afternoon of the 13th, he visited the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant. The stable production and gradual increase in output of the existing small blast furnaces in this plant attracted Comrade Shaoqi's attention. He believed that the normal production experience of these small blast furnaces was very good and worth promoting.

The Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant, which is under construction, currently has three 15-cubic-meter blast furnaces and one 55-cubic-meter blast furnace in production. Originally, each 15-cubic-meter blast furnace in this plant used a blower with an air volume of 42 cubic meters. Due to the low air pressure and insufficient air volume, the furnace temperature could not rise, resulting in the blast furnaces being in a state of low production for a long time. The Party committee of this plant called on everyone to solve this problem. After joint efforts by technicians and workers, they developed a method of operating five blowers together, supplying air to three blast furnaces simultaneously, which solved the problem of insufficient air volume and increased the daily output of each of the three small blast furnaces from 11 tons to about 20 tons. Among them, the No. 2 furnace produced 34.4 tons of standard pig iron on August 24, with a utilization coefficient of 0.436, reaching the advanced level of iron smelting in the country. This plant also used two 75-horsepower and one 100-horsepower blowers simultaneously on the 55-cubic-meter blast furnace, increasing the daily output of this blast furnace from 50 tons to about 60 tons.

Another experience of this plant in stabilizing production and increasing output is to use manual labor and indigenous methods for ore dressing and crushing. First, the gangue in the ore is picked out, and then the lean ore and rich ore are classified. Then, the various ores are crushed into small pieces about the size of walnuts to reduce the ore particle size, and they are screened to remove dust and debris. The rich ore that has been selected and crushed is directly charged into the furnace, while the lean ore is roasted, slagged, and desulfurized using indigenous methods to improve the grade before being smelted in the furnace. When charging, a method of charging a little less at a time, charging more frequently, and reducing the particle size of coke is also adopted. This makes the material distribution in the furnace more uniform, allows the ore to be fully preheated in the upper part of the furnace body, increases the opportunity for indirect reduction of the ore, and accelerates the charging speed. Comrade Shaoqi once summarized this method in popular terms as "eat less, more meals, and eat fine grains," asking everyone to use a method similar to a doctor treating stomach ailments to overcome the problem of small blast furnaces not being able to produce normally. In order to improve the labor productivity of ore dressing and crushing, Comrade Shaoqi instructed the Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee comrades to pay close attention to the tool improvement of ore dressing and crushing, and to accelerate the manufacture of crushers and ore dressing machines.

At present, many small blast furnaces across the country are not producing normally, and the iron output is not high. There are certainly many reasons for this, but the main ones are insufficient air volume and poor ore selection. Therefore, the experience of the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant has universal significance. Comrade Shaoqi believes that the widespread promotion of these experiences can enable small blast furnaces across the country to produce stably, thereby greatly increasing China's pig iron smelting capacity. After hearing Comrade Shaoqi's opinion, Comrade Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, has notified the Provincial Iron and Steel Office to convene an on-site meeting in Shijiazhuang within the next day or two in order to promote these experiences throughout the province in a timely manner.

    少奇同志指示推广石家庄炼铁经验 
    鼓足风量  精选矿石
    ·让小高炉少吃、多餐、吃细粮·
    新华社天津16日电　中国共产党中央委员会副主席、全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长刘少奇同志在河北视察工作期间，13日下午在石家庄市参观了石家庄钢铁厂。这个厂的现有几座小高炉能够稳定进行生产，逐步提高产量的情况，引起了少奇同志的重视，他认为这几座小高炉正常生产的经验很好，值得加以推广。
    正在建设中的石家庄钢铁厂，目前已有三座十五立方公尺的高炉和一座五十五立方公尺的高炉进行生产。原来这个厂每座十五立方公尺的高炉各用一台四十二立方公尺风量的鼓风机，由于风压低，风量不够用，炉温升不上去，因而高炉长期处于低产状态。这个厂党委号召大家解决这一问题。经过技术人员和工人的共同努力，研究出用五台鼓风机并在一起开动，同时供给三座高炉用风，解决了风量不足的问题，使这三座小高炉各由日产十一吨提高到二十吨左右。其中二号炉在8月24日曾经生产标准生铁三十四点四吨，利用系数为零点四三六，达到全国炼铁的先进水平。这个厂又在五十五立方公尺的高炉上，同时使用了两台各七十五马力和一台一百马力的鼓风机，使这座高炉的日产量由五十吨提高到六十吨左右。
    这个厂稳定生产、提高产量的另一经验，是利用人工和土法进行选矿和碎矿，首先把矿石中的夹石挑出去，同时把贫矿和富矿加以分类，然后把各种矿石分别碎成核桃那样大小的小块，以降低矿石粒度，并且加以筛选，去掉尘土杂物。经过挑选和破碎的富矿直接入炉，贫矿则用土法焙烧、退碴、退硫，提高品位以后，再入炉冶炼。在装料的时候，又采用了一次少装一点、勤装几次、焦炭粒度也同样改小的方法。这样就可以使炉内布料较为均匀，使矿石在炉身上部得到了充分的预热，增加了矿石间接还原的机会，加速了下料的速度。少奇同志曾经把这种办法通俗地概括为“少吃、多餐、吃细粮”，要大家用类似医生治胃病的方法，来克服小高炉不能正常生产的毛病。为了提高选矿和碎矿的劳动生产率，少奇同志指示石家庄市委同志切实注意选矿和碎矿的工具改良，加快碎矿机和选矿机的制造。
    目前全国还有不少小高炉生产不够正常，出铁不多。原因当然很多，而主要是风量不足，矿石选得不好。因此，石家庄钢铁厂的经验具有普遍意义。少奇同志认为，普遍地推广这些经验，就可以使全国的小高炉都能稳定地进行生产，从而大大提高我国生铁冶炼的能力。听到少奇同志的意见以后，中共河北省委第一书记林铁同志已经通知省钢铁办公室，在最近一两天之内，就在石家庄召开现场会议，以便及时地把这些经验在全省范围内推广。
