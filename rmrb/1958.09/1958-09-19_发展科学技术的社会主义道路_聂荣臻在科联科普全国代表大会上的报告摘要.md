Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Nie Rongzhen, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Science Planning Commission, delivered an important report this morning at the National Congress of the National Science and Technology Association and the National Popular Science Association on the road and principles for developing China's scientific undertakings and carrying out the technological revolution.

Nie Rongzhen said: The development of industry and agriculture and the construction of national defense all require science and technology to catch up rapidly, requiring the entire Party to strengthen its leadership over science and technology work and for the entire Party and all people to vigorously promote scientific undertakings. Our goal for the Second Five-Year Plan is: to master the most important "cutting-edge" science and technology as soon as possible; to catch up with the world's advanced countries in industrial science and technology; and to complete the summary of China's unique and rich experiences in agriculture and medicine, and to be in the world's most advanced position. To this end, we must fight hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of science and technology in our country, strive to complete the twelve-year science plan in 1962, and catch up with the world's advanced level of science and technology.

When discussing that China's high-speed development of science and technology is due to the superiority of the socialist system and the correct leadership of the Party, Vice Premier Nie pointed out: The Party's absolute leadership over science and technology is the fundamental guarantee for fully utilizing the superiority of the socialist system and rapidly developing China's scientific and technological undertakings. The struggle over whether or not scientific work needs the Party's leadership and whether or not politics should take command is still ongoing. After more than a year of rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, the bourgeois road in scientific work has been shattered, and the Party's leadership over scientific work has been greatly strengthened. The facts after the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle powerfully prove that under the leadership of the Party, with politics in command, China's scientific undertakings can develop at an unprecedented speed. It is now very clear that the Party is not only a true expert in leading the development path, principles, and policies of science, but also, because politics is in command and resolutely relying on the broad masses, it is fully capable of leading in scientific work, and is much better than the leadership of bourgeois experts.

Nie Rongzhen then profoundly elaborated on the correct path for developing science and technology in our country, which is the scientific path of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's actual conditions. He said: After nine years, especially the recent year or so, of scientific work practice, under the illumination of the Party's general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, we have initially explored some basic experiences in developing our country's scientific undertakings, and the path of our country's scientific work is taking shape. Our path is completely opposed to the path of bourgeois scientific work. Our path requires resolutely implementing the Party's leadership over scientific work, putting politics in command, requiring the display of communist spirit in scientific work, criticizing the bourgeois traditions in scientific work, and eliminating the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie in all aspects. This path can be summarized in the following four aspects: (1) Liberate thought and break superstitions. (2) Proceed from the tasks of socialist construction. (3) Comprehensive planning. (4) Mass line.

When talking about liberating thought and breaking superstitions, he pointed out: Chairman Mao's inspiration on liberating thought, breaking superstitions, and advocating the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act has an unparalleled significance for our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and it is of particular importance to the development of our country's science and technology. Our nation is hardworking, brave, and ingenious. Historically, our country has produced many great scientists, great inventors, and great thinkers. Mathematics, astronomy, medicine, agriculture, etc. have all made great contributions and shone brightly in the history of world science. It was only in the last hundred years, under the severe oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, that our country's production could not develop, and science and culture also lagged behind. The view of superstition towards foreign countries and valuing foreign things has left a deep mark on the people of our country, especially intellectuals. With the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have stood up. This kind of inferiority complex is unfounded for the liberated Chinese people. We have made amazing achievements in agriculture, industry, and science and technology, and the inferiority complex of superstition towards foreign countries should be completely shattered in the face of facts. In science and technology, we must learn from all the achievements created by our predecessors and learn from all the advanced experiences in the world. Our learning is to solve the practical problems in our country's socialist construction. Therefore, we must combine it with China's actual conditions for creative learning. At the same time, we must also attach importance to the historical tradition of science. No class in the world has ever been able to attach such importance to the historical tradition of science as the proletariat, and it is never bound by tradition; it can absorb all the true scientific achievements in the history of the world and carry them forward. This is the true scientific attitude. In the Great Leap Forward, many scientific and technological achievements were made by ordinary workers, farmers, and young people, and the concept of superstition towards experts was gradually broken. This is by no means to ignore the role of experts. What is said here is that one should not be superstitious towards experts, and superstition is wrong. Experts should place themselves among the masses and constantly learn from the masses in order to make progress; arrogance and detachment from the masses will surely lead to failure. Many experts themselves also have great superstitions and should also be broken. Only by breaking superstitions can they play a greater role.

When talking about developing our country's science and technology from the tasks of socialist construction, he said: We advocate that science and technology should proceed from the development of production and serve socialist construction, using "tasks" to drive science. The relationship between science and production is the relationship between theory and practice. For example, agricultural science should proceed from increasing production to drive soil science, plant physiology, plant protection, water conservancy irrigation, plant cultivation and other disciplines. However, bourgeois scholars advocate that science has its "own" laws of development and should develop science from the needs of the development of its own discipline. For example, the study of plant physiology can completely disregard the need to increase crop production, and only conduct isolated research in the laboratory. Therefore, not only can it not be applied to production, but also good results cannot be obtained in theory. These are two completely different paths, mutually opposed paths. According to the experience of developing science in our country in the past few years, it has been proven that only by proceeding from the tasks of production and construction can our country's scientific undertakings be developed the fastest. Of course, we must also see the other aspect: scientific and technological research work should also strive to be ahead of production and construction. The choice of technical policies and the formulation of production plans often depend on the results of research work. Therefore, in addition to the research tasks urgently needed by current production that should be given priority, some research work that is not very urgent for current production but can open up new avenues for production development must also be carried out as early as possible. Scientific research work should be seen further and the scope of activities should be wider in order to explore more avenues and better guide the development of production. It is wrong to only see the needs of current production and easily cancel research work that opens up new avenues.

Regarding the comprehensive planning of science and technology work, he said: Bourgeois scholars believe that scientific research is exploratory work, and it is impossible to have a plan, and the plan will bind their "free creation." We believe that this view is completely wrong. In a socialist society, scientific and technological research must be developed in a planned way, and it can be developed in a planned way. At the beginning of 1956, under the instruction of Chairman Mao's "Comprehensive Planning, Strengthen Leadership", we made a long-term plan for the development of science and technology in our country from 1956 to 1967. In 1957 and 1958, we also made two national annual plans. The practice in the past two years has proven that although this plan has some shortcomings, the direction and orientation are correct, and it basically meets the requirements of our country's socialist construction. This plan has greatly promoted the development of our science and technology. According to the results of the recent inspection, it has played a great role in organizing forces, breaking through key points, and driving the general. In particular, through planning, it has reviewed its own strength and clarified which are the weak links and which are the blank sectors; those should be seized tightly, those should be requested to be advanced, which has a very great role in rapidly catching up with the world's advanced level. Of course, the plan must have its flexibility, especially the science and technology plan, which should be more flexible than the production plan. Because it must change with the development of national construction, it must also pay close attention to the new trends in the development of world science and technology, and revise and supplement it at any time. However, one should never deny the planning of science and technology work because of emphasizing flexibility. Here he especially pointed out that under the principle of "Comprehensive Planning, Strengthen Leadership", we must pay attention to unifying competition and cooperation.

Nie Rongzhen finally talked about the mass line in scientific work. He said: The mass line is the basic method that is effective in all our Party's work, but whether the mass line can be applied to science and technology work is a question that has not been resolved in the past. Bourgeois experts advocate taking the expert line and oppose taking the mass line. They believe that scientific research is a matter for the academy. If the mass line is taken, it will be messed up, the level will be lowered, and it will not be scientific. But in fact, many inventions and creations are made by the masses, and they are very outstanding. Some of them have not only great practical significance, but also great theoretical significance. Many research works of research institutions and universities are done by young people, and even against the will of old scientists, avoiding old scientists. The scientific level has not been lowered, but has been improved; it is not unscientific, but very scientific. Isn't it a good thing to disrupt academic research in this way, isn't it very necessary? It can be seen that scientific research work should also completely take the mass line. In order to implement the mass line, according to the experience of the past few years, especially the past six months, we believe that scientific work should implement the policy of combining the central and local governments, combining "native" and "foreign", combining professional scientific and technological research institutions and mass movements of technological revolution, combining popularization and improvement, and combining production, teaching and scientific research.

    发展科学技术的社会主义道路
    聂荣臻在科联科普全国代表大会上的报告摘要
    新华社18日讯　中共中央委员、国务院副总理兼科学规划委员会主任聂荣臻今天上午在全国科联、全国科普全国代表大会上就发展中国科学事业、开展技术革命的道路和方针作了重要报告。
    聂荣臻说：工农业的发展和国防建设都要求科学技术工作迅速地赶上去，要求全党加强对科学技术工作的领导，全党全民大办科学事业。我们在第二个五年计划期间的奋斗目标是：尽快掌握最重要的“尖端”的科学技术；在工业科学技术方面赶上世界上先进的国家；在农业和医学方面要完成中国特有的丰富经验的总结工作，而居于世界上最先进的地位。为此，我们要苦战三年，基本改变我国科学技术面貌，争取在1962年完成十二年科学规划，赶上世界先进的科学技术水平。
    聂副总理在论述我国科学技术高速度发展是由于社会主义制度的优越性和党的正确领导时指出：党对科学技术的绝对领导是充分发挥社会主义制度的优越性、迅速发展我国科学技术事业的根本保证。科学工作要不要党的领导，要不要政治挂帅的斗争，现在还在继续进行。经过一年多来整风运动和反右派斗争，科学工作中的资产阶级道路被粉碎了，党对科学工作的领导极大地加强了。整风反右派斗争以后的事实有力地证明，在党的领导下，政治挂帅，我国的科学事业就能以史无前例的速度发展。现在看得很清楚，党不仅在对科学的发展道路、方针、政策的领导方面是真正的内行，而且由于政治挂了帅，坚决地依靠广大群众，在科学业务上也完全能够领导，而且比资产阶级专家的领导要好得多。
    聂荣臻接着深刻地阐述了我国发展科学技术的正确道路，也就是马克思列宁主义普遍真理与中国实际相结合的科学道路。他说：经过九年来特别是最近一年多来科学工作的实践，在党的多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的照耀下，我们已经初步摸索出一些发展我国科学事业的基本经验，我国科学工作的道路正在形成中。我们的道路是和资产阶级科学工作的道路完全对立的。我们的道路要求坚决贯彻党对科学工作的领导，政治挂帅，要求在科学工作中发挥共产主义精神，批判科学工作中资产阶级的传统，从各方面清除资产阶级的思想影响。这条道路概括起来有下述四个方面，即：（一）解放思想，破除迷信。（二）从社会主义建设任务出发。（三）全面规划。（四）群众路线。
    在谈到解放思想、破除迷信时，他指出：毛主席关于解放思想，破除迷信，提倡敢想、敢说、敢作的共产主义风格的启示，对于我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业有无可比拟的巨大意义，对于我国科学技术的发展更有特别重要的意义。我们的民族是勤劳勇敢的、心灵手巧的。历史上我国出过许多大科学家，大发明家，大思想家。数学、天文学、医学、农学等都曾在世界科学史上有过伟大的贡献，大放异彩。只是在近百年来，在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的严重压迫下，我国的生产不能发展，科学文化也随着落后了。迷信外国，以洋为贵的观点，在我国人民中，特别是知识分子中留下了深刻的烙印。中华人民共和国成立，中国人民站起来了。这种自卑情绪对于解放了的中国人民来说是毫无根据的。我们无论在农业、工业和科学技术方面都做出了惊人的成绩，迷信外国的自卑情绪在事实面前应该被彻底粉碎了。在科学技术上我们要学习一切前人所创造的成果，学习世界上一切先进的经验。我们的学习是为了解决我国社会主义建设中的实际问题，因此，必须结合我国实际进行创造性的学习，同时也要重视科学的历史传统，世界上从来没有任何一个阶级能够像无产阶级这样重视科学的历史传统，又决不为传统所束缚；它能够吸收世界历史上一切真正的科学成果而加以发扬光大，这才是真正的科学态度。在大跃进中许多科学技术成果都是普通工人、农民和青年人做出来的，迷信专家的观念逐渐被打破了。这里绝没有忽视专家作用的意思，这里讲的是对专家不要迷信，迷信就错了。专家应该把自己放在群众之中，不断向群众学习，才能进步；自高自大，脱离群众，是一定会失败的。许多专家自己也有很大的迷信，也应该破除。只有破除了迷信，才能发挥更大的作用。
    在谈到从社会主义建设任务出发来发展我国的科学技术的时候，他说：我们主张科学技术应当从发展生产，服务于社会主义建设出发，用“任务”来带动科学，科学与生产的关系，也就是理论与实际的关系。例如，农业科学方面应当从提高产量出发来带动土壤学、植物生理、植物保护、水利灌溉、植物栽培等学科。而资产阶级学者则主张科学有它“自己”发展的规律性，应从本门科学发展的需要出发来发展科学，例如研究植物生理学可以完全不考虑作物增产的需要，只孤立地在实验室中进行研究，因而不仅不能应用到生产中去，在理论上也得不到好的结果。这是两条截然不同的道路，互相对立的道路。根据我国几年来发展科学的经验证明，只有从生产建设任务出发，才能最快地发展我国的科学事业。当然我们还必须看到另外一方面：科学技术研究工作，还应当努力走在生产建设的前面。技术政策的抉择，生产计划的制定，往往要以研究工作的成果为依据。因此，除了从当前生产迫切需要中提出的研究任务应当优先进行以外，某些对当前的生产并不十分迫切，但能为生产发展开辟新途径的研究工作，也必须及早进行。对于科学研究工作应当看得远一点，活动范围应当更宽些，以便探索更多的途径，更好地对生产发展起指导作用。只看到眼前生产需要，轻易取消开辟新途径的研究工作，是不对的。
    关于科学技术工作的全面规划，他说：资产阶级学者认为科学研究是探索性的工作，不可能有计划，计划会束缚他们的“自由创造”。我们认为这种看法是完全错误的。在社会主义社会中，科学技术的研究必须有计划地发展，而且能够有计划地发展。1956年初我们在毛主席“全面规划，加强领导”的指示下，做了我国1956—1967年科学技术发展远景规划。1957年和1958年我们又做了两次全国性的年度计划。两年来的实践证明，这个规划虽然有一些缺点，但是方针、方向是正确的，基本上是合乎我国社会主义建设要求的。这个规划大大促进了我们科学技术的发展，根据最近检查的结果看来，它对于组织力量，突破重点，带动一般，起了很大的作用。特别是通过规划，检阅了自己的力量，明确了那些是薄弱环节，那些是空白部门；那些应该抓紧，那些要求提前，对于迅速地赶上世界先进水平具有非常大的作用。当然规划必须有它的灵活性，特别是科学技术规划，应该比生产规划更加灵活些。因为它必须随着国家建设的发展而改变，又必须密切注意世界科学技术发展的新动向，随时加以修正和补充。但是决不应该因为强调灵活性，而否认科学技术工作的计划性。这里他特别指出，在“全面规划，加强领导”的原则下，一定要注意把竞赛和协作统一起来。
    聂荣臻最后谈到了科学工作的群众路线问题。他说：群众路线是我们党一切工作中都行之有效的基本方法，但是群众路线能不能运用在科学技术工作上，是过去没有解决的问题。资产阶级专家主张走专家路线，反对走群众路线，他们认为科学研究是学院里的事，如果走群众路线，就给搞乱了，水平就降低了，不科学了。但是目前事实上，许多发明创造是群众干出来的，而且很出色，其中有些不仅具有重大的实际意义，也有重大的理论意义。许多研究机关和高等学校的研究工作，是青年干出来的，甚至于是违背老科学家的意旨，避着老科学家干出来的。科学水平不仅没有降低，而是提高了；不是不科学，而是很科学。这样地打乱了学院式的研究，不是好得很吗，不是很应该的吗？可见科学研究工作也完全应该走群众路线。为了贯彻群众路线，根据几年来，特别是最近半年来的经验，我们认为科学工作应该实行中央和地方并举，“土”“洋”并举，专业的科学技术研究机关和技术革命的群众运动相结合，普及与提高相结合，生产、教学和科学研究三者相结合的方针。
