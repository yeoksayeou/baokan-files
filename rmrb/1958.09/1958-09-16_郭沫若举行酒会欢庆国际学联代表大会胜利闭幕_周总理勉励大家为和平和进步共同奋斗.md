    After a burst of warm applause, International Student Union President Balicco was invited to speak. In his speech, Balicco once again expressed the common aspirations of students worldwide. He said, "We students are working hard to create a better future for ourselves. Therefore, we naturally love peace and oppose war, and oppose those who undermine peace; therefore, we oppose imperialism, oppose colonial aggression, and oppose all reactionary forces; therefore, in the resolutions passed at this congress, we unanimously opposed atomic war, demanded the withdrawal of American and British invading troops from the Middle East, and opposed American imperialist aggression in the Taiwan Strait region. The resolutions passed at the congress all express the demands of our youth and reflect the wishes of our youth." Balicco concluded his speech by raising a glass to world peace.

    The banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel was filled with joy of peace and friendship. When Premier Zhou Enlai slowly walked around the hall to meet with student representatives from various countries, applause rang out in the hall, and the representatives cheered "Long live peace" in newly learned Chinese. Some representatives even sang songs of friendship with China. Wherever Premier Zhou went, it became the center of joy.
