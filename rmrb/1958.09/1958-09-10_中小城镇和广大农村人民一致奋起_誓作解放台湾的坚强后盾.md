Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: A powerful protest demonstration movement against U.S. imperialism's military provocations and war threats is spreading like wildfire to all medium and small cities and vast rural areas and remote regions of the country. Hundreds and thousands of medium and small towns across the country held rallies or parades with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people participating on the 7th and 8th. The vast rural areas also universally held protest demonstrations. The unanimous roar from the mouths of millions of people is: to support the struggle to liberate Jinmen and Mazu and liberate Taiwan with practical actions, to vow to be the backing of the government and the People's Liberation Army, and to smash U.S. imperialism's military provocations with all our strength.

According to news from various regions, the scale of this rally and parade is unprecedented. As of the 8th in Henan Province, 120 counties and cities had held mass rallies, with approximately over 20 million people participating in the rallies and demonstrations, accounting for half of the province's total population. In Anhui Province, more than 10 million people participated in demonstrations on the 7th alone. People from all walks of life in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City held a radio broadcast rally on the evening of the 8th to support Premier Zhou's statement and oppose U.S. imperialism's military provocations, and more than 2 million people across the province listened to the broadcast.

Such a nationwide demonstration movement is not only developing vigorously in the inland but is also rapidly spreading to remote areas. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, from the Hulunbuir Grassland and the Greater Khingan Range forest area in the east to the Ordos region in the west, twelve towns held rallies and parades on the 7th, with a total of more than 400,000 people of all ethnic groups participating. Some emerging towns in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province held protest rallies or demonstrations on the 7th. In Dacaidan, the center of the Qaidam Basin alone, 2,500 employees participated. In Luobei County, Heilongjiang Province, on China's far northern border, more than 130 volunteer reclamation team members of the Beijing Youth Collective Farm, which was established three years ago, immediately held a meeting on the 7th after listening to the broadcast of Premier Zhou's statement.

Various forms of mass rallies and demonstrations were held on the coastal islands of Fujian Province close to the front lines. Dongshan Island held a large parade of 14,000 people on the 7th. More than 20,000 fishermen and militiamen in Chongwu Peninsula, Hui'an County, held a demonstration parade early in the morning of the 8th. Eight hundred thousand residents of the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang Province jointly held rallies and demonstrations with the troops stationed on the island. More than 1,000 fishermen from the coastal areas of Fujian, who were often harassed by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique and were forced to fish in the Zhoushan fishing grounds, also participated in the rally to denounce the crimes of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique.

During the rallies and parades, people from all over the country put forward the resounding slogans of "We will provide grain if grain is needed, we will provide steel if steel is needed, and we will provide people if people are needed," expressing their firm determination to respond to the provocations of the American aggressors with practical actions such as improving current industrial and agricultural production and running people's communes well. The No. 1 blast furnace of the No. 1 Factory of the Shashi Iron and Steel Company in Hubei Province could only produce 0.8 tons of iron on September 1, but on the day Premier Zhou made his statement, it produced 6.4 tons of iron. They are determined to reach a daily output of 10 tons of iron by October 1. Workers in Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, stated that they would leap forward from the task of producing 8,000 tons of steel this year to 10,000 tons. The people of Xushui County, Hebei Province, stated that they would guarantee the completion and over-fulfillment of the county's task of smelting 12,000 tons of iron and 1,000 tons of steel, and achieve an average yield of 1,500 jin of grain per mu throughout the county.

　　中小城镇和广大农村人民一致奋起
　　誓作解放台湾的坚强后盾
    新华社9日讯　反对美帝国主义军事挑衅和战争威胁的强大的抗议示威运动，正在以燎原之势向全国各中、小城市和广大农村以及边远地区展开。全国数以千百计的中、小城镇在7、8两日内都举行了数万人、数十万人参加的集会或游行，广大农村也普遍举行了抗议示威活动。从千百万人民群众的口中发出的一致吼声是：要以实际行动支援解放金门、马祖和解放台湾的斗争，誓作政府和人民解放军的后盾，全力粉碎美帝国主义的军事挑衅。
    根据各地消息，这次集会和游行的规模之大是前所未有的。河南省到8日止，已有一百二十个县、市举行了群众大会，参加集会和示威游行的约有二千多万人，占全省总人口的一半。安徽省各地7日一天参加示威游行的就有一千多万人。浙江省和杭州市各界人民在8日晚举行了拥护周总理声明、反对美帝国主义军事挑衅的广播大会，全省各地有二百多万人收听了广播。
    这样一个全民性的示威运动，不仅在内地如火如荼地发展，而且迅速地向边远地区展开。在内蒙古自治区，东起呼伦贝尔草原、大兴安岭林区，西到鄂尔多斯地区，有十二个城镇在7日举行了集会游行，参加的各族人民共达四十多万人。青海省柴达木盆地的一些新兴市镇，7日都举行了抗议集会或示威游行。仅在柴达木中心大柴旦一地，就有二千五百名职工参加。在我国极北边境上的黑龙江省萝北县，三年前成立的北京青年集体农庄一百三十多名志愿垦荒队员，在7日听了周总理声明的广播后，立即举行大会。
    在接近前线的福建省沿海各岛屿都举行了各种形式的群众集会和示威游行。东山岛在7日举行了一万四千人的大游行。惠安县崇武半岛两万多渔民和民兵在8日清晨举行示威游行。浙江省舟山群岛八十万居民，和岛上驻军联合举行了集会和游行示威。经常遭受美蒋骚扰被迫来到舟山渔场捕鱼的一千多名福建沿海渔民，也参加集会控诉美蒋罪行。
    各地人民在集会和游行时都纷纷提出“要粮有粮、要钢有钢、要人有人”的响亮口号，表示坚决以搞好当前工农业生产、办好人民公社等实际行动来回击美国侵略者的挑衅。湖北省沙市钢铁公司第一厂第一号高炉，9月1日还只能生产零点八吨铁，在周总理发表声明这一天就生产出六点四吨铁，他们决心要在10月1日达到日产十吨铁。湖南省湘潭市的工人表示要把今年生产八千吨钢的任务跃进到一万吨。河北省徐水县人民表示，保证完成和超额完成全县炼铁一万二千吨、炼钢一千吨的任务，并实现全县粮食平均亩产一千五百斤。
