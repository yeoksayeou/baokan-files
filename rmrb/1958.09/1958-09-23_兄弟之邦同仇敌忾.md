Brothers United Against a Common Enemy

By Our Correspondent Chen Jiabao

The fire of "Opposing U.S. Imperialist Interference in China's Internal Affairs and Supporting the Chinese People's Liberation of Taiwan and Coastal Islands" is burning fiercely in the hearts of millions of Vietnamese people. The fire was ignited by U.S. imperialism. While U.S. imperialism provokes the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area and encourages the Chiang Kai-shek clique to set fires, it also ignites the flames of shared hatred in the hearts of 600 million Chinese people and more than 10 million people in North Vietnam. These days, the hearts of the people of Hanoi are as turbulent as the hearts of the people of Beijing. Whether in factories or in the suburbs, whenever the topic turns to the situation in the Taiwan Strait area, people's moods are always difficult to calm. They resent the provocative behavior of the U.S. aggressors and believe that this is a reckless act of "the blind not fearing the tiger." Chairman Mao's statement that the U.S. is putting a noose around its own neck has been used by the Vietnamese people as the most powerful catchphrase when condemning U.S. imperialism. The Hanoi newspapers are filled with news of the Chinese people's anti-U.S. demonstrations and marches, news of the mobilization of the entire population and articles warning U.S. aggressors.

As a Chinese journalist, when I first set foot on this heroic brotherly country, my first impression was the long-standing and most sincere friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples. Now, I am once again moved by this friendship.

Just last weekend evening, the head of the Hanoi Unified Club, a Vietnamese cadre who had rallied from South Vietnam to North Vietnam, said to me excitedly: "Recently, the number of people coming to the club to listen to the 'Anti-American Aid China' report has been overwhelming." He said, "We hate U.S. imperialism to the core. When we think of our southern compatriots under the iron heel of the U.S. military, we naturally think of the provocations and insults of the U.S. aggressors against the Chinese people. Supporting the Chinese people is supporting ourselves." His words express the sentiments of millions of Vietnamese people.

In the eyes of the heroic Vietnamese people, the United States is nothing more than a "paper tiger" that appears strong but is weak inside. The so-called "power" of the United States is not new to the Vietnamese people. Long before U.S. military personnel and war materials were secretly transported into South Vietnam, U.S. weapons had already been used by the French "Expeditionary Force" to gun down the Vietnamese people. However, it is laughable that the French "Expeditionary Force" became a "weapons transportation team" that supplied the Vietnamese People's Army with U.S.-made cannons and tanks. Today, if you ask a People's Army soldier who has experienced the Dien Bien Phu campaign, he will vividly tell you the story of how the French army carried U.S. carbines to perform the "hand salute."

The mood of the Vietnamese People's Army soldiers, who grew up in the flames of anti-aggression, is more excited than anyone else here. People's Army hero Pham Trong Tang said excitedly at the Hanoi People's rally against U.S. imperialist interference in China's internal affairs held today: "Our hearts are as angry as the Chinese people. In order to support the Chinese people in liberating their own territory, the Vietnamese People's Army soldiers must improve their combat effectiveness, work hard in production and construction, and be ready to smash all the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism at any time." This hero told reporters before the meeting that these days, the People's Army soldiers have not relaxed their vigilance at all. They are closely watching every move of the U.S. bandits in the Taiwan area every minute and every second.

The anti-U.S. tide of the people reached another peak in Hanoi this morning. More than 50,000 Hanoi workers, farmers, soldiers, and overseas Chinese flocked to the Grand Theater Square early in the morning to hold a grand rally and demonstration to oppose U.S. aid to China.

The solemn square was once the meeting place for the August Revolution uprising thirteen years ago. The people who were baptized by the August Revolution gathered here again today to roar at the U.S. aggressors! Countless slogans surrounded the square tightly like a red forest. Two huge slogans on the wall of the Grand Theater read: "U.S. Imperialism Get Out of Taiwan, Get Out of South Vietnam, Get Out of the Middle East!" and "Resolutely Support the Chinese People in Liberating Taiwan and Coastal Islands!" A huge cartoon of the U.S. putting a noose around its own neck was held high; tens of thousands of fists were raised again and again; anti-U.S. slogans resounded through the clouds.

Hanoi's workers, farmers, soldiers, and labor heroes all angrily condemned the crimes of the U.S. aggressors at the meeting. Farmer representative Chen Desheng said: Vietnamese farmers are excited about the upsurge of China's agricultural Great Leap Forward and the movement of the entire population becoming soldiers; we are angry at the provocative behavior of U.S. imperialism. Worker representative Nguyen Cong Hoa said that the Vietnamese working class will always stand with the Chinese working class.

The procession of more than 50,000 people marched mightily through the streets and downtown areas. Walking at the forefront of the procession were Nguyen Xuan Thuy, Le Dinh Tham, Chinese Ambassador He Wei, Soviet Charge d'Affaires Popov, Korean Ambassador Kim Chang-cheol, and representatives of other brotherly countries' embassies in Vietnam. They kept chanting slogans and moving forward.

Today, almost every pedestrian on the streets of Hanoi wore a small red slogan that read "Support the Chinese People in Liberating Taiwan and Coastal Islands." They chanted slogans together with the demonstrators and constantly joined the procession. The slogans rose and fell, forming a huge wave of sound. This is the team of more than 10 million people in North Vietnam, this is the voice of more than 10 million people; the pulse of more than 10 million Vietnamese people is beating together with the pulse of 600 million Chinese people!

    兄弟之邦同仇敌忾
    本报记者　陈家保
    “反对美帝国主义干涉中国内政、支持中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿”的怒火正在千百万越南人民的心里熊熊燃烧。火是美帝国主义给点燃起来的。美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区向中国人民挑衅，怂恿蒋介石集团放火的同时，也在六亿中国人民和一千多万越南北方人民的心里燃起了敌忾同仇的烈火。这些日子来，河内人民的心也和北京人民的心一样的沸腾。不论走到工厂或市郊，只要话题谈到台湾海峡地区的局势，人们的心情总是那样难于平静，他们愤恨美国侵略者的挑衅行为，并且认为这是“瞎子不怕虎”的狂妄举动。毛主席所说的美国自己套上绞索的一番话已经被越南人民谴责美帝国主义时当作最有力的警句来引用。河内报刊更是满篇满页的刊载着中国人民反美示威游行、全民武装的消息和警告美国侵略者的文章。
    作为一个中国记者，当我刚踏上这个英雄的兄弟之邦的时候，我的第一个印象就是中越两国人民历史悠久最诚挚的友谊；而现在我又一次被这种友谊而感动。
    就在上一个周末的晚上，河内统一俱乐部的负责人、一位从南越集结到北越来的越南干部激动地对我说：“最近到俱乐部来听‘反美援华’的报告的人挤得水泄不通。”他说：“我们恨透了美帝国主义，想起处在美军铁蹄下的南方同胞就自然而然地想起美国侵略者对中国人民的挑衅和污辱。支持中国人民也就是支持我们自己。”他的话道出了千千万万越南人民的心声。
    在英雄的越南人民的心目里，美国只不过是一只外强中干的“纸老虎”。美国的所谓“威力”对越南人民来说也并不新奇。早在美国军事人员和战争物资偷偷摸摸地运进南越之前，美国的武器早已通过法国“远征军”的手来枪杀越南人民。然而可笑的是法国“远征军”却成了给越南人民军输送美制大炮坦克的“武器输送队”。今天你如果问起一位身经奠边府战役的人民军战士，他就会生动有趣地告诉你关于法军怎样手携美国卡宾枪作“举手礼”的故事。
    在反侵略的烈火里成长起来的越南人民军战士的心情比起这里任何人都要激动。人民军英雄范仲唐在今天举行的河内人民反对美帝国主义干涉中国内政的大会上激动地说：“我们的心同中国人民一样的愤怒，为了支援中国人民解放自己的领土，越南人民军的战士一定要提高战斗力，努力劳动生产和建设，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋。”这位英雄在开会前对记者说，这些日子以来，人民军战士丝毫没有放松警惕，他们一分一秒地密切注视着美国强盗在台湾地区的所作所为。
    人民反美的怒潮今天上午在河内又一次达到了高峰。五万多河内工人、农民、士兵和华侨大清早就从四面八方涌到大戏院广场举行盛大的反美援华的集会和示威游行。
    庄严的广场曾经是十三年前八月革命起义的集合地点。受到八月革命洗礼的人民今天又集合在这里向美国侵略者发出怒吼！数不尽的标语像红色的树林把广场紧紧围住。大戏院墙上的两幅巨大标语上写着：“美帝国主义滚出台湾、滚出南越、滚出中近东！”、“坚决支持中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿！”美国自套绞索的巨幅漫画被高高举起；数万个拳头一次又一次地伸举；反美的口号声响彻云霄。
    河内的工人、农民、士兵和劳动英雄都先后在会上愤怒谴责美国侵略者的罪行。农民代表陈德盛说：越南农民为中国农业大跃进和全民皆兵运动的高潮而感到兴奋；我们对美帝国主义的挑衅行为感到愤恨。工人代表阮公和说，越南工人阶级永远同中国工人阶级站在一起。
    五万多人的游行队伍浩浩荡荡地走过大街闹市，走在队伍最前面的是阮春水、黎庭探、中国大使何伟、苏联临时代办波波夫、朝鲜大使金昌哲和其他兄弟国家驻越南使馆的代表等。他们不断呼着口号前进。
    河内街头的行人今天几乎每人都别上了一小块“支持中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿”的红色小标语，他们同游行者一起呼口号而且不断加入了游行队伍。此起彼落的口号声汇成了巨大的声浪。这是一千多万越南北方人民的队伍，这是一千多万人的呼声；一千多万越南人民的脉搏正在同中国六亿人民的脉搏一起跳动！　九月二十一日
