The CCP Central Committee Issues Five Important Documents
Launch a Socialist and Communist Education Movement Universally in Rural Areas This Winter and Spring
Unleash a Winter Production Upsurge Centered on Deep Plowing, and Do a Good Job in Soil Improvement, Water Conservancy Construction, and Fertilizer Work
Eliminate the Four Pests Before National Day, and Persistently Carry Out Both Regular Work and Shock Campaigns
(Dispatch from this newspaper) The CCP Central Committee issued five important documents: 1. Instructions on launching a socialist and communist education movement universally in rural areas this winter and spring. 2. Instructions on water conservancy work. 3. Instructions on deep plowing and soil improvement. 4. Instructions on fertilizer issues. 5. Decision on continuing to carry out the Four Pests Elimination Campaign. These five documents (full text on page two) were adopted at the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee on August 29, 1958.

The "Instructions on launching a socialist and communist education movement universally in rural areas this winter and spring" first proposes that, in the past ten months, "The political consciousness of the 500 million peasants, developed on the basis of the nationwide rectification and anti-rightist struggle, the rural socialist education movement, and the general line propaganda and education movement, has become increasingly high." "This is the most valuable spiritual strength and material foundation in China's socialist construction cause. In order to timely summarize experience, promote the communist spirit, and ensure an even greater and more comprehensive harvest in the summer and throughout 1959; and in order to conduct open discussions and debates on the issue of how to distribute the income of agricultural cooperatives and whether to establish people's communes, it is necessary to carry out a widespread socialist and communist education movement in rural areas this winter and spring."

The instructions then emphasize: "In this movement, it is necessary to fully promote the communist style of 'pulling out white flags and planting red flags,' use countless examples of large-scale increases in production to speak greatly about the superiority of the socialist system, further strengthen the determination and confidence of the broad masses of peasants in taking the socialist road, thoroughly criticize the remaining spontaneous capitalist tendencies of some wealthy peasants, and continue to eliminate individualism and departmentalism in people's thinking, while vigorously establishing communism." "All 'white flags' and even 'gray flags' should be pulled out, and red flags should be universally planted, so that the general line of socialist construction is more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people."

The instructions conclude by saying, "On the basis of the broad masses of peasants having their minds liberated, their awareness raised, and their drive further enhanced, and on the basis of the great harvest of 1958, we should formulate a plan for a greater leap forward in agricultural production in 1959, especially a greater harvest in the summer, as well as a plan for the implementation of various production-increasing measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, tool improvement, and field management, and formulate a longer-term comprehensive vision plan including 'industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military,' and 'agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries.' Through all this, we should unleash a winter production upsurge even greater than that since the winter of 1957, strive for a greater harvest in the summer of 1959, strive for a comprehensive leap forward in grain, cotton, and oil throughout 1959, and accelerate China's socialist construction."

The "Instructions on Water Conservancy Work" first states that the planned earth and stone works in various regions have exceeded 100 billion cubic meters, predicts that water conservancy construction this winter and next spring will far exceed the achievements of last winter and this spring, and then puts forward four opinions on the planning of water conservancy projects. Regarding the issue of guiding principles, the instructions require that "When implementing the 'three-main' principle of 'small-scale as the main focus, water storage as the main focus, and collective-run as the main focus,' attention should be paid to appropriately developing medium-sized projects and some necessary and possible large-scale projects on the premise of small-scale projects as the foundation, and gradually forming a relatively complete water conservancy project system through the mutual combination of large, medium, and small projects in a planned manner." The instructions also provide specific instructions on planning issues, methods for solving water conservancy problems in different regions, and strengthening tool reform.

In the "Instructions on Deep Plowing and Soil Improvement," it is clearly pointed out that "Deep plowing is the center of agricultural production increase technical measures," and analyzes the five major benefits of deep plowing, and puts forward the methods and steps for deep plowing and soil improvement. The instructions emphasize and require that "Politics should be in command, the whole party should be mobilized, and the whole people should take action. From now on, before this year's autumn planting and this winter and next spring, a high tide of deep plowing and soil improvement movement should be launched."

The "Instructions on Fertilizer Issues" require that various regions pay more attention to improving the quality of fertilizer, increase the production of indigenous fertilizer, continue to vigorously promote household fertilizer accumulation, refine household fertilizer to reduce transportation volume and improve fertilizer efficiency, promote fertilizer accumulation in the fields, use idle land to plant green manure crops, and pay attention to applying fertilizer according to the soil.

In the "Decision on Continuing to Carry Out the Four Pests Elimination Campaign," it is required that various regions universally hold a large-scale Four Pests Elimination Campaign before National Day, to greet National Day cleanly; and persistently carry out both regular work and shock campaigns.

    总结农业跃进经验　发扬共产主义精神　争取明年更大丰收
    中共中央发布五项重要文件
    今冬明春在农村中普遍展开社会主义和共产主义教育运动
    掀起以深耕为中心的冬季生产高潮，作好土壤改良、水利建设和肥料工作
    在国庆节以前大除四害，并把经常工作和突击运动坚持不懈地搞下去
    本报讯　中共中央发布了五个重要文件：一、关于今冬明春在农村中普遍展开社会主义和共产主义教育运动的指示。二、关于水利工作的指示。三、关于深耕和改良土壤的指示。四、关于肥料问题的指示。五、关于继续展开除四害运动的决定。这五个文件（全文见第二版）是1958年8月29日在中共中央政治局扩大会议上通过的。
    “关于今冬明春在农村中普遍展开社会主义和共产主义教育运动的指示”首先提出：近十个月来，“五亿农民在全民整风和反右派斗争，在农村社会主义教育运动，在总路线宣传教育运动等基础上所发展起来的政治觉悟愈来愈高。”“这是我国社会主义建设事业中最可珍贵的精神力量和物质基础。为着及时地总结经验，发扬共产主义精神，保证1959年夏季和全年全面的更大丰收；为着就农业社的收入如何分配问题和是否建立人民公社问题进行鸣放辩论，今冬明春在农村中进行一次广泛的社会主义和共产主义教育运动，是必要的。”
    指示接着强调指出：“在这个运动中，要充分发扬‘拔白旗、插红旗’的共产主义风格，以无数大增产的实例，来大讲特讲社会主义制度的优越性，更加坚定广大农民走社会主义道路的决心和信心，彻底批判一部分富裕农民残存的资本主义自发倾向，在人们的思想上继续破除个人主义，本位主义，大立共产主义。”“应该把一切‘白旗’以至‘灰旗’统统拔掉，把红旗普遍插起来，使社会主义建设总路线更加深入人心。”
    指示最后说，“应该在广大农民群众在思想解放、觉悟提高、干劲更足的基础上，在1958年大丰收的基础上，制定出1959年农业生产更大跃进特别是夏季更大丰收的增产计划，以及水、肥、土、种、密、工具改良、田间管理等项增产措施的实施计划，制定出比较长期的包括‘工、农、商、学、兵’、‘农、林、牧、副、渔’的全面的远景规划。通过这一切，掀起一个比1957年冬季以来更大的冬季生产高潮，争取1959年夏季更大的丰收，争取1959年全年粮、棉、油全面跃进，加速我国的社会主义建设”。
    “关于水利工作的指示”，首先说明各地规划的土石方工程已超过了一千亿公方，预见今冬明春的水利建设将远远超过去冬今春的成绩，接着对水利工程的规划提出了四项意见，关于方针问题，指示要求“在贯彻执行‘小型为主，以蓄为主，社办为主’的三主方针时，应该注意到在以小型工程为基础的前提下，适当地发展中型工程和必要的可能的某些大型工程，并使大、中、小工程相互结合，有计划的逐渐形成为比较完整的水利工程系统。”指示并对规划问题、解决不同地区水利问题的办法和加强工具改革作了具体指示。
    在“关于深耕和改良土壤的指示”中，明确指出“深耕是农业增产技术措施的中心”，并分析了深耕的五大好处，提出了深耕和改良土壤的办法和步骤。指示强调要求“政治挂帅，全党动员，全民动手，从现在起，在今年秋种以前和今冬明春，掀起一个深耕和改良土壤运动的高潮”。
    “关于肥料问题的指示”要求各地更多地注意提高肥料的质量，增加土化肥的生产，继续大力提倡农家积肥，精制农家肥料以减少运输量，提高肥效，提倡田头积肥，利用休闲地种植绿肥作物，注意按土施肥。
    在“关于继续展开除四害运动的决定”中，要求各地在国庆节以前，普遍举行一次大规模的除四害运动，干干净净，迎接国庆；并且把经常工作和突击运动坚持不懈地搞下去。
