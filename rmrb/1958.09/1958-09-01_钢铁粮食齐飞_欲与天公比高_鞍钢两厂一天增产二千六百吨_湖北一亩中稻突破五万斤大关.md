Steel and Grain Soar Together: Aiming to Outdo Nature
　　Anshan Iron and Steel Plants Increase Production by 2,600 Tons in One Day
    Hubei Achieves Over 50,000 Jin per Mu for Mid-Season Rice
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 31st – The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 and No. 2 Steelmaking Plants jointly launched high-yield steelmaking "satellites" on the 29th. On this day, the workers of the two plants increased steel production by more than 2,600 tons compared to the average daily production plan. This amount of steel, when rolled into steel products, can be used to manufacture twenty rolling mills with an annual output of 50,000 tons of steel, or to manufacture more than eight hundred heavy-duty trucks. This is one of the most brilliant victories achieved by the Anshan steelmaking workers in the recent week.
    The daily steel output of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant on the 29th exceeded the record created on the 25th by 334 tons; on the same day, the daily production record of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant exceeded the new record of the 27th by 419 tons. In the past week, the two steel plants have launched a total of five high-yield "satellites."
    The production conditions of the two steel plants are no different from the past; what is different is that the workers' enthusiasm and spirit of cooperation are higher and better. In these two plants, a tense battle atmosphere prevails both before and after the furnace. Whenever a furnace is being repaired, the workers from the adjacent open hearth furnace, who have just finished repairing their furnace, immediately plunge into a new battle before they even have time to wipe away their sweat. Raw material workers, charging machine operators, repair workers, and ingot workers are all striving to be the first, closely coordinating with the open hearth furnace workers' operations, and striving to shorten the operation time of each process. When No. 9 open hearth furnace of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant was tapping steel, a water pipe on the furnace suddenly leaked. Repair workers Jiang Hongfu and others, braving the scorching heat of the furnace at over 1,000 degrees, quickly climbed to the top of the furnace to carry out emergency repairs, ensuring the production of the open hearth furnace. The workers of the Youth Solidarity Furnace Group C of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant, in order to create conditions for the next shift to produce more steel, took the initiative to stay behind after their shift ended at twelve o'clock the previous night, regardless of fatigue, to participate in the labor of cleaning up the waste under the slag channel. The tank repair workers of this plant discovered a shortage of molten steel tanks and braved the high temperature of over 600 degrees to rush to repair the molten steel tanks. With the close cooperation of various types of work, the open hearth furnace workers of the two steel plants made great use of their skills in rapid steelmaking, creating many new records of more steel per furnace and faster refining; among them, No. 4 open hearth furnace of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant refined a furnace of steel in only four hours and fifty minutes, shortening the state plan by more than three hours.
    The leading cadres of the No. 1 and No. 2 Steelmaking Plants, from the plant director and Party committee secretary to the section chiefs and branch secretaries of the work sections, like in the past ten days or so, also joined the battle to extract steel from time on this day together with the workers. They wore work clothes, carried shovels, and braved the scorching furnace temperature to carry out furnace repairs with the workers. On this day, they stayed by the furnace for nearly sixteen hours, and many people were still summarizing the day's experiences and lessons and evaluating the results of each furnace by the furnace until after one o'clock in the morning.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 31st – Jianxin No. 6 Cooperative of Macheng County, Hubei Province, harvested a total of 53,493 jin of dry rice from 1.017 mu of mid-season rice fields, creating an astonishing record of an average yield of 52,599 jin of dry rice per mu. This is the first mid-season rice high-yield record in our country to cross the "50,000 jin threshold," which is 8,730 jin heavier than the largest mid-season rice "satellite" launched by Changchun Cooperative of Yingcheng County in this province a few days ago.
    This mid-season rice high-yield record of Jianxin No. 6 Cooperative in Xionggou Township, Macheng County, was jointly created by eleven cadres and members, including Zhou Kedong, secretary of the Xionggou Township Communist Youth League General Branch and a Communist Party member. Among them were also Zou Haiping, director of Jianxin No. 6 Cooperative and a Communist Party member, Zou Fengying, secretary of the cooperative's Communist Youth League branch, and female Communist Youth League member Zou Jilan. From the beginning of spring plowing, they carried out cultivation reforms in this high-yield experimental field. Before transplanting, they carried out four plowing, three harrowing, and two raking, with a plowing depth of eight inches; at the same time, combined with plowing, the following fertilizers were applied in batches: 2,500 jin of green grass, 174 dan of cattle manure, 20 jin of superphosphate, 30 jin of ammonium sulfate, and 8 jin of gypsum; on this basis, they also implemented close planting with a spacing of two inches between plants and rows in that field. After transplanting, they successively applied fertilizer twice more.
    By mid-July, they decided to further increase close planting in order to strive for even higher yields. Their method was transplanting: all the seedlings from another 20 mu of experimental fields also cultivated by them were transplanted to this field. At the same time, in order to meet the requirements of highly dense planting, they also pulled up the seedlings in this field while transplanting, and used套犁 (a kind of plow) and manual digging to deepen the cultivated layer to one foot and five inches, and combined with deep plowing, the following fertilizers were applied twice: 30 dan of night soil, 500 dan of old soil, 400 dan of cattle manure, 100 jin of soybean cake, 20 jin of ammonium sulfate, 60 jin of superphosphate, and 160 jin of ash. After this, the seedlings from the 20 mu of fields and the seedlings from this one mu of field were planted together in the field. Then, they planted second-season late rice in the 20 mu of fields that were emptied due to transplanting.
    In this high-yield field, the already mature rice ears were orderly lying in the field. From a distance, the golden ears of rice were spread higher than the ridges. Leaders at all levels from the province to the township have sent representatives to participate in the acceptance work.

　　钢铁粮食齐飞  欲与天公比高
　　鞍钢两厂一天增产二千六百吨
    湖北一亩中稻突破五万斤大关
    新华社鞍山31日电　鞍钢第一和第二炼钢厂职工在29日齐放炼钢丰产卫星。这一天，两个厂职工比平均日产计划增产钢二千六百多吨。这些钢轧成钢材，可以用来制造年产五万吨钢材的轧钢机二十套，或用来制造载重汽车八百多辆。这是鞍山炼钢工人在最近一周来取得的许多胜利中的一次最辉煌的胜利。
    第一炼钢厂29日钢的日产量，比25日创造的纪录多出三百三十四吨；同一天第二炼钢厂的日产纪录，比27日的新纪录多产钢四百一十九吨。一周来，这两个钢铁厂总共已放出五颗丰产卫星。
    两个炼钢厂的生产条件同过去并没有两样；所不同的，是职工们的干劲和协作精神更加高昂、更加好了。在这两个厂里，炉前炉后都呈现着紧张战斗的气氛。每当一个炉子补炉时，邻近平炉上刚补完炉子的工人汗水还没来得及擦，就立即投入了新的战斗。原料工人、装料机手、检修工人、铸锭工人，也个个奋勇争先，紧密配合平炉工人的操作，努力缩短每个工序的操作时间。第一炼钢厂九号平炉正在出钢时，炉上一个水管突然漏水。检修工人江鸿福等人冒着一千多度炉温的灼烤，迅速爬上炉顶进行抢修，保证了平炉生产。第二炼钢厂青年团结炉丙班工人，为了给下班创造多炼钢的条件，在前一天的深夜十二点下班后，不顾疲劳，主动留下来参加清理渣道下面废物的劳动。这个厂修罐工人发现钢水罐不足，就冒着六百多度的高温抢修钢水罐。两个炼钢厂平炉工人在各工种密切配合下，大施快速炼钢本领，创造了很多炉多装快炼的新纪录；其中第一炼钢厂四号平炉仅用四点五十分钟就炼出了一炉钢，比国家计划缩短三个多小时。
    第一炼钢厂和第二炼钢厂的领导干部，从厂长、党委书记到工段的段长、支部书记，像过去十多天来一样，这一天也同工人一起投入向时间索取钢铁的战斗。他们穿着工作服，拿着锹，同工人一起冒着灼人的炉温进行补炉。这一天他们差不多在炉旁守了十六个小时，直到午夜一点多钟，许多人还在炉旁总结着当天的经验教训，评比各炉子的战果。
    据新华社武汉31日电　湖北省麻城县建新六社在一点零一七亩中稻田里，共收干谷五万三千四百九十三斤，创造了平均亩产干谷五万二千五百九十九斤的惊人纪录。这是我国第一个跨过“五万大关”的中稻高产纪录，它比这个省应城县长春社在几天前放出的全国最大的中稻“卫星”还要重八千七百三十多斤。
    麻城县熊家沟乡建新六社的这个中稻高产纪录，是共青团熊家沟乡总支书记、共产党员周克东等十一个干部和社员共同创造的。其中还有建新六社社主任、共产党员邹海萍，社共青团支部书记邹风英，以及女共青团员邹吉兰等。从春耕开始，他们就在这块高产试验田里进行了耕作改革。在插秧前曾进行过四犁、三耙、两耖，耕层深达八寸；同时，结合犁田分批施用了如下肥料：青草二千五百斤、牛栏粪一百七十四担、过磷酸钙二十斤、硫酸铵三十斤、石膏八斤；在此基础上，他们又在那块田里实行了株距、行距各二寸的密植。插秧后，他们又先后追了两次肥。
    到7月中旬，他们又决定进一步加大密植，以争取更高的丰产。他们的方法是移栽：把另外二十亩也是他们培育的试验田的秧苗，全部移栽到这块田里来。同时，为了适应高度密植的要求，他们还在移栽的同时，把这块田里的秧也拔起来，用套犁和人工挖的办法，把耕层加深到一尺五寸，并结合深翻又分两次用了如下肥料：水粪三十担、陈土五百担、牛栏粪四百担、豆饼一百斤、硫酸铵二十斤、过磷酸钙六十斤、草木灰一百六十斤。这以后，才把二十亩田的秧苗和这一亩多田的秧苗一起栽到田里去。接着，他们又在那因移栽而空下的二十亩田里，种下了二季晚稻。
    在这块丰产田里，已经成熟的稻谷有秩序地伏在田里，老远一看，黄闪闪的稻穗铺得比田埂还高。从省到乡，各级领导部门都派有代表来参加验收工作。
