　　The newspaper reported that the Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Plant did not forget to help others in the Great Leap Forward. Even when they did not have enough electric motors for themselves, they allocated one to help a small factory trial-produce a shaper; they also proactively lent a portion of their limited large steel plates to another factory to help them solve production difficulties. The selflessness of the workers at the Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Plant has been widely praised. It is said that they did this because they were inspired by the help they had received from others in the past: although there is a distinction between "you" and "me" between factories and enterprises, they are all engaged in a common cause.

　　The words "common cause" attract the people of the whole country, who are selflessly engaged in socialist construction, like a magnet. It encourages everyone to strive for progress and to strive to plant red flags in all kinds of work. It also reminds people to help other comrades who have difficulties when they are showing their skills, so that they can make progress together. Because people understand: you are working for socialist construction, and he is working for socialist construction; everyone is working for our common cause. Only when everyone does their job well can our common cause be more perfect. It is precisely because of this that thousands of factories and enterprises like the Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Plant have emerged across the country. They treat the difficulties of others as their own, and generously give away things that they also need. This communist style of action is like a seed of happiness, spreading all over the country and breeding everywhere. Even those who have not received any help from others are infected by this joy of helping others, and selflessly help anyone who needs help, without considering their own gains or losses.

　　However, people in some individual factories and regions have not been able to do so. Although they are all diligent and hardworking, and are also trying to produce more products for the country, either because they have a relatively strong reserve of materials and technology and have not encountered any difficulties, or because their various material reserves are unevenly distributed, they fear that helping others will affect their own allocation. Therefore, some even want to implement "blockades", or want others to exchange with things they need, called "bartering."

　　Those who revel in "blockades" and "bartering" naturally think that they are the smartest, but they have never thought that this is indeed an unwise act. Because, first, socialist large-scale production is comprehensive collaborative production. The production of a factory or a region is a link in the entire chain of collaboration. Each link works for the entire chain, and the entire chain also works for each link. This kind of relationship cannot be "locked" away. Let's take the factories with more material reserves as an example! Where do the stored materials come from? How are the produced products handled? Do they handle everything themselves and completely "self-sufficient"? This is impossible. At the same time, no matter how large the warehouse of a factory or unit is, and how many materials are stored, compared with the countless large and small factories in the country, it is always a limited small part, and this limited part of the reserves, compared with the endless leap forward in production, is even more insignificant! If every factory competes to blockade itself, where will you go when you need to replenish materials?

　　Second, if those who advocate blockades still want to do a good job in their own production and make contributions in socialist construction, then their actions violate their original intentions. As mentioned earlier, socialist large-scale production is a chain. Since one link in the chain has put up a sign saying "no through road", wouldn't the steps in the entire production be disrupted? And if every link follows suit, wouldn't the entire production stagnate or even be destroyed? Therefore, this kind of thinking and practice actually harms socialism with departmentalism and individualism.

　　Of course, for those who temporarily lack a comprehensive view, these consequences may be beyond their expectations. It is only because they consider problems from their own factories and regions, while neglecting and forgetting the collective, so they have not yet joined the enthusiastic communist collaboration. We believe that once these people see the problem clearly, they will resolutely pick up the key, open the rusty lock, jump out of the small world of a factory or a region, and develop the spirit of communist collaboration.

　　打开锈锁
  　杨眉
    报载北京第二机床厂在跃进中不忘帮助别人。当他们自己的电动机还不够的时候，还拨出了一台电动机去帮助一个小工厂试制牛头刨床；又把自己仅有的一部分大钢板主动地借给另一个工厂，帮助它们解决生产中的困难。北京第二机床厂职工们的这种舍己为人的行为，得到普遍的赞扬。据说，他们所以这样做，也是从过去别人对他们的帮助里得到的启示：工厂企业间虽有你我之分，但是所进行的都是共同的事业。
      “共同的事业”几个字，像吸铁石一样吸引着正在忘我地进行社会主义建设的全国人民。它激励着每一个人奋发向上，争取在各种工作中都能插上红旗。它还使人随时记住：当自己大显身手的时候，应该帮助其他有困难的同志，使他们共同进步。因为人们懂得：你也是为社会主义建设，他也是为社会主义建设，人人都是为了我们的共同事业。只有人人都把工作做好的时候，我们的共同事业才能更完美无缺。正是因为这样，全国已经涌现了千万个像北京第二机床厂一样的工厂和企业单位。他们把别人的困难当作自己的困难，慷慨地将自己也很需要的东西让给了别人。这种具有共产主义风格的作为，像一粒粒幸福的种子，撒遍了全国各地，到处滋生。即使还没有得到过他人的任何帮助的人，也因感染了这种助人之乐，无私地援助任何需要帮助的人，而不计较一己的得失。
    但是，个别工厂和地区的人们却还没有能够这样做。虽然他们的工作都很勤奋努力，也在一心想给国家生产更多的产品。然而，或者由于他们有较雄厚的物资和技术储备，目前还没有遭到什么困难，或者因为他们的各种物资储备余缺不均，所以惟恐因为援助别人而影响了自己的调配。因此，有的甚至要实行“封锁”，或者要别人拿着自己需要的东西来交换，叫作“以货易货”。
    陶醉于“封锁”和“以货易货”的人，当然以为自己是最聪明的了，其实他们何曾想到这确是一种不聪明的行为。因为，第一，社会主义大生产是全面的协作生产。一个工厂、一个地区的生产，是整个协作链条上的一环。每一个环节在为整个链条工作，整个链条也在为每一环工作。这种关系，“锁”也“锁”不住的。就以物资储备较多的工厂来说吧！所储物资来自何处？所生产的产品如何处理？难道自己都包了下来，完全来个“自给自足”么？这是不可能有的事。同时，无论一个工厂或单位的仓库有多么大，储备的物资有多么多，同全国无数个大大小小的工厂比起来，总是有限的一小部分，这有限的一部分储备，再与生产上永无止境的跃进比起来，又何其渺小！如果每一个工厂都竞相封锁起来，当你到了需要补充物资的时候，又哪里去寻？
    第二，如果说提倡封锁的人，还是为了把自己的生产搞好，要在社会主义建设中立功劳的话，那么他们的所作所为，是有违自己的初衷的。前面所说，社会主义大生产是一个链条，既然链条上的一环挂出了“此路不通”的牌子，整个生产中的步骤岂不被打乱？又如每一个环节都如法泡制，整个生产岂不停滞不前甚至遭到破坏？所以这种想法和做法，实际上是以本位主义和个人主义而害了社会主义。
    当然，对于一时缺乏全面观点的人来说，这些后果，或许都是他们始料所不及。只是由于他们一味从自己的工厂、地区去考虑问题，而忽略和忘记了集体，所以暂时还没有投到火热般的共产主义大协作中来。我们相信，这一些人一旦看清楚了问题，他们便会毅然拿起钥匙，打开锈锁，跳出一个工厂、一个地区的小天地，发扬出共产主义大协作的精神来的。
