Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 25th: The "Red Star" newspaper published an article on the 25th, recounting the friendship between Soviet Red Army pilots who helped the Chinese people fight against Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War and Chinese pilots, and their determination to resolutely support the just struggle of the Chinese people.

The article pointed out that the American bandits' forcible occupation of Taiwan and their provocations against great China filled the Soviet pilots' hearts with anger and hatred for the warmongers. They are preparing, if necessary, to go and help their loyal Chinese friends smash the plot of the interventionists. The friendship between Chinese and Soviet soldiers is eternal and unbreakable.

This air force unit is one of the earliest Soviet air force units, established in 1918 under Lenin's instructions. From the end of 1937 to 1938, a group of pilots from this unit volunteered to help the Chinese people fight against the Japanese invaders. In their first air battle, they shot down eleven Japanese aircraft. They achieved even more brilliant victories in an air battle over Hankou on the eve of May 1, 1938. In 1945, this unit also participated in the war against the Japanese invaders in Northeast China.

Now, the pilots of this unit have established a close friendship with Chinese pilots. Last year and this year, Chinese aviation personnel and personnel from this unit have visited each other.

(Report from our Moscow correspondent on the 26th) These days, as a dark cloud hangs over the Taiwan area and news of American imperialism's infringement on our sacred territory constantly comes from the newspapers, every Chinese comrade living in the Soviet Union feels that the Soviet people are even more cordial to us, and the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is even more consolidated. Everywhere, whether in factories or schools, Soviet people will hold your hand and say to you kindly: Chinese friends, two hundred million Soviet people stand firmly with you!

Millions of Soviet people are writing to Soviet newspapers to express their support for the Chinese people. An elderly Soviet woman, Yelizalova, 73 years old and a member of the Party for 34 years, wrote in a letter to "Pravda": After reading the news in the newspaper about the American invasion of the People's China, I felt extremely angry. I call on all women in the world to rise up against American imperialism's aggression in the Far East. We all love peace, but the aggressors should also know that we are not afraid of war, and we are ready to fight if justice is threatened.

Eight Soviet guerrillas who fought against the German fascist bandits during the Great Patriotic War also wrote to "Pravda." Their instructor, Khromov, said: "We used to fight the invaders behind the German lines. We know that any aggressor's plan is doomed to failure! We want to express the following words to the Chinese people through 'Pravda': 'Chinese brothers, we are always with you! We admire your strong will and heroic spirit in liberating your own country, and we wish you great victory in the struggle against the American and Chiang Kai-shek aggressors.'"

In the "Pravda" editorial office, the reporter also saw a touching letter written by a blind man named Repin, who is very old. In his letter, he wrote: Now the eyes of the people of the world are focused on the American imperialism's aggression against the Chinese people. No language can express my anger at the United States. As a participant in the domestic war, I once fought alongside Chinese soldiers in the Soviet Red Army against the White bandits. Now, when the Chinese people who have stood up are threatened by aggression, we Soviet people will do everything possible and use every means to help our Chinese friends.

Seven workers from a factory in Kursk, Pritvorov, Tarasov, and others, wrote: If the American aggressors dare to start a war, then we will not hesitate to fight side by side with the Chinese people, and we are ready to volunteer to go to China to defend the fruits of labor with our Chinese friends.

A Soviet active serviceman, Volochuk, also wrote to "Pravda" saying: American troops should immediately withdraw from Taiwan! If they dare to launch a war, then the Chinese people have enough strength to completely defeat the aggressors. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all the righteous people in the world are on the side of the Chinese people!

    苏联飞行员对美国挑衅愤怒填膺
    时刻准备着以行动支援中国兄弟
    苏联人民纷纷表示要和中国人民并肩打击侵略者
    新华社莫斯科25日电  “红星报”25日刊登了一篇文章，叙述曾在抗日战争时期帮助中国人民打击日寇的苏联红军某部飞行员和中国飞行员的友谊，以及他们坚决支援中国人民的正义斗争的决心。
    文章指出，美国强盗强占台湾并向伟大的中国进行挑衅，使苏联飞行员心中充满对战争贩子的愤怒和仇恨。他们正准备着如果需要的话前去帮助自己忠实的中国朋友粉碎干涉者的阴谋。中苏军人的友谊是永恒的和牢不可破的。
    这一空军部队是苏联最早的空军部队之一，是1918年根据列宁的指示建立的。从1937年底到1938年，这支部队的一群飞行员曾志愿帮助中国人民打击日寇。他们在第一次空战中击落了十一架日机。他们在1938年5月1日前夕在汉口的一次空战中，曾经取得了更加辉煌的胜利。1945年，这支部队又曾在中国东北参加过对日寇的战争。
    现在，这支部队的飞行员和中国飞行员建立了亲密友谊。去年和今年，中国航空人员和这支部队人员曾经相互进行了访问。
    本报莫斯科26日电  这几天，当一团黑云悬在台湾地区的上空，报纸上不断传来美帝国主义对我国神圣领土进行侵犯的时候，每个居住在苏联的中国同志都会感到，苏联人民对我们是更加亲切了，中苏两国的友谊是更加巩固了。在任何地方，不管是工厂还是学校，苏联人都会拉着你的手，亲切地向你说：中国朋友们，两亿苏联人民紧紧地和你们站在一起！
    千千万万苏联人写信给苏联报纸表示他们对中国人民的支持。一位年高七十三岁的苏联妇女，有三十四年党龄的叶里扎洛娃在给“真理报”的信中写道：读到报上美国侵犯人民中国的消息以后，我感到异常愤怒。我号召世界上所有妇女起来反对美帝国主义在远东的侵略。我们都爱和平，但是侵略者也应当知道，我们并不怕战争，如果正义受到威胁，我们也准备战斗。
    八位苏联卫国战争时期曾经打击过德国法西斯强盗的游击队员也写信给“真理报”，他们的指导员赫罗莫夫说：“我们曾经在德寇后方打击过侵略者，我们晓得，任何侵略者的计划都是要失败的！我们想通过“真理报”向中国人民表达这样几句话：“中国兄弟们，我们永远和你们在一起！我们对你们解放自己国土的坚强意志和英勇精神万分钦佩，祝你们在打击美蒋侵略者的斗争中取得巨大的胜利。”
    在“真理报”编辑部，记者还看到了一封令人感动的信件，写信的人是一位名叫列平的盲人，他的年纪已经很大了，他在信里写道：现在世界人民的视线都集中在美帝国主义对中国人民的侵略上，没有任何语言可以表示我对美国的愤怒。作为一个国内战争的参加者，我曾经与苏联红军中的中国战士一起并肩打过白匪军，现在当站了起来的中国人民受到侵略威胁的时候，我们苏联人民将尽一切力量，用一切办法帮助我们的中国朋友。
    库尔斯克一个工厂的工人普里特沃洛夫、塔拉索夫等七个人写道：如果美国侵略者胆敢掀起战争，那时我们将不惜一切与中国人民并肩而战，我们准备志愿去中国与我们的中国朋友一起捍卫劳动果实。
    苏联现役军人沃洛丘克也写信给“真理报”说：美国军队应当立即撤出台湾！如果他们胆敢发动战争，那么中国人民有足够的力量彻底打垮侵略者，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界正义的人民全站在中国人民一边！
