Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, 3rd dispatch: Under the direction of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is implementing the so-called "wartime financial policy," recklessly printing new banknotes to plunder the wealth of the Taiwanese people to maintain the massive military expenditures of the Chiang army. The Chiang gang's "wartime financial policy" has caused the value of the Taiwan dollar issued by the Bank of Taiwan to plummet recently. On August 21, forty Taiwan dollars could be exchanged for one US dollar, but on August 31, it devalued to forty-three Taiwan dollars for one US dollar. On September 1, the devaluation was even greater, with fifty Taiwan dollars needed to exchange for one US dollar. Business circles in Taipei anticipate that the Taiwan dollar will continue to plummet, and they are rushing to buy gold, foreign currency, and goods. Prices are soaring throughout Taiwan, and shops and factories are closing down every day in various towns, leaving the market in complete chaos. The lives of the Taiwanese people are threatened by the economic chaos created by the Chiang gang, and people in both urban and rural areas are filled with anxiety.

　　滥印新钞　物价飞涨
    台湾市场一片混乱
    新华社3日讯　台北消息：蒋介石集团在美国指使下实行所谓“战时金融政策”，滥印新钞票掠夺台湾人民财富来维持庞大的蒋军军费开支。蒋帮的“战时金融政策”使台湾银行发行的台币币值最近暴跌。8月21日，台币四十元换一美元，8月31日贬值为四十三元换一美元。9月1日暴跌的幅度更大，五十元台币才换一美元。台北市工商界预料台币还会继续暴跌，纷纷抢购黄金、外币和物资。台湾各地物价飞涨，各市镇每天都有商店工厂倒闭，市场一片混乱。台湾人民的生活都受到蒋帮造成的这种经济混乱局面的威胁，各城乡人心惶惶。
