Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 21st - Qinghai Province's Qaidam Basin has achieved a high-yield record for spring wheat of 8,585 jin and six liang per mu, surpassing the national high-yield record for winter wheat of 7,320 jin set by the Heping Cooperative in Xiping County, Henan Province in July by 1,265 jin and six liang. This high-yield "satellite" was launched by the Saishike Farm, located on the eastern edge of the basin at an altitude of 2,970 meters. This is a reclamation area surrounded by mountains, with a frost-free period of only over 90 days throughout the year, an average temperature of 3.5 degrees Celsius, a rainfall of 180 mm, and a large temperature difference between day and night. The emergence of this high-yield fact powerfully demonstrates: success depends on human effort, and humans can conquer nature.
    This spring wheat field is part of the farm's First Production Team's high-yield field, with an area of 1.059 mu. The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee appointed Yang Wenjin, Secretary of the Haixi Mongol-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Xu Guangzong and Zhang Xizhong, Deputy Directors of the Qinghai Provincial Reclamation Bureau, to inspect and accept the results.

    Reported by this newspaper - The Jiao Liuying Team of the 12th People's Commune in Shenqiu County, Henan Province, cultivated 1.12 mu of millet, which actually yielded more than 29,000 jin, with an average yield of 26,687 jin and 15 liang per mu. County Head Li Yunfeng, Deputy Chief of the Civil Affairs Section Hu Tianrui, and Deputy Secretary of the Township Party Committee Li Shumen supervised the harvesting and threshing, proving it to be true.
    The Fanying Team cadres cultivated one mu of Golden Queen corn, which actually yielded 15,120 jin and 12 liang.

    Reported by this newspaper - The Sixth Production Team of the Guozhuang Brigade of the 12th People's Commune in Shenqiu County, Henan Province, has launched another sorghum "satellite" into the sky. This 1.154 mu of sorghum actually yielded more than 26,000 jin, with an average yield of 22,720 jin per mu. The cultivators were Brigade Leader Guo Qianxiang and six others. County Head Li Yunfeng and other comrades conducted a thorough on-site inspection and confirmed that it was true.

    Reported by this newspaper - The Ouziqiang Production Team of the Jili Cooperative in Tangbian Village, Jinjing Township, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, has launched a high-yield peanut satellite. The team, in collaboration with Cooperative Committee members Su Gongci and Ou Zhongme, and Deputy Director of the County Agriculture Bureau Lin Shipin, jointly cultivated a 1.2 mu high-yield experimental field, which actually yielded more than 32,000 jin of dry peanuts, equivalent to an average yield of 26,968 jin and 12 liang per mu.

    Reported by this newspaper - The 3.409 mu of sesame land by the Xiao Family Road in the Shuangzhou Cooperative of the Wanpu Township, Linxiang County, Hunan Province, was harvested on August 28. After six days of sun exposure, it produced a total of more than 8,300 jin of dry sesame, with an average yield of 2,440 jin per mu.
    More than 30 people, including Fang Jiayan, Deputy Secretary of the Township Party Committee, participated in this inspection.
    This 3.4 mu sesame experimental plot was planted by Liu Chunshan, Director of the Shuangzhou Cooperative, Liu Jingfa, Captain of the First Production Team, and young people Mo Shengyin, Zhang Liuyin, Qin Zhongao, and women's team leader Wang Xiaode.
