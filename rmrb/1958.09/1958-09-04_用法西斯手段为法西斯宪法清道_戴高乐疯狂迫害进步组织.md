Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 2nd -- The French authorities are intensifying their persecution of democratic and progressive forces. A group of police officers broke into the national headquarters of the French Communist Youth League to conduct a search. They openly stated that this was to confiscate the recording of the speech by Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, calling on young people to reject De Gaulle's dictatorial draft "constitution" in the "referendum." The police also confiscated the French Communist Youth League's organ, "Avant-Garde."

The police also conducted similar unreasonable searches at the "Book and Newspaper Distribution Center" in Paris, the Strasbourg Communist Youth League office, and the Communist Party local organization in Villejuif in the Seine-et-Oise department. In Rouen, the Communist Party local organization's office was broken into by the police, who confiscated Thorez's speech recording and some of the Party's publications.

At the same time, the government also prohibited the Communist Party of Puy-de-Dôme from holding festival celebrations.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd -- Paris Dispatch: The Paris police authorities took the most severe measures restricting freedom of movement on French soil since the end of the Nazi occupation on the 1st. They announced that, from now on, North Africans residing in France are prohibited from going out on the streets from 9:30 PM to 5:30 AM local time. If it is necessary to go out at this time for work reasons, prior permission must be obtained.

This is one of a series of measures recently taken by the French authorities to intensify the persecution of North Africans residing in France. While announcing the above measures, police officials revealed that Paris police killed three North Africans, injured seven, and arrested one hundred and five last week, and that two thousand nine hundred and seventeen people had been interrogated.

　　戴高乐疯狂迫害进步组织
    新华社巴黎2日电　法国当局加紧迫害民主进步力量。一批警察闯进法国共产主义青年联盟全国总部进行搜查。他们公然说：这是为了没收法国共产党总书记多列士号召青年们在“公民投票”中否决戴高乐独裁“宪法”草案的演说录音带。警察还没收了法国共产主义青年联盟的机关刊“前卫”。
    在巴黎“书籍和报刊发行中心”、斯特拉斯堡共产主义青年联盟办事处、塞纳—瓦斯省威伊城的共产党地方组织，警察也进行了同样的无理搜查。在卢昂，共产党地方组织的办事处被警察破窗而入，没收了多列士的演说录音带和党的一些刊物。
    同时，政府还禁止共产党多姆山省委员会举行节日庆祝活动。
    新华社3日讯　巴黎消息：巴黎警察当局1日采取了希特勒占领结束以来法国本土上最严厉的限制行动自由的措施，它宣布，今后禁止旅居法国的北非人从当地时间二十一点三十分到五点三十分上街。如果因为工作需要，必须在这个时间外出的，事先必须得到允许。
    这是法国当局最近为加紧迫害旅居法国的北非人而采取的一系列措施之一。在宣布上述措施的同时，警察方面的人士透露，巴黎警察在上周杀害了三个北非人，打伤七人，逮捕了一百零五人，并且有二千九百一十七个人曾经受盘查。
