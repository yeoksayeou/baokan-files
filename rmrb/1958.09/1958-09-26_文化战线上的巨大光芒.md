	Great Radiance on the Cultural Front
	Miao Huaming, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
	A certain culture is always a reflection of a certain society's politics and economy, and serves them; the relationship between the two should be, and always has been, complementary. Henan Province, while continuously launching giant satellites in agricultural production and steel production, and realizing the people's communes, has also basically achieved "illiteracy-free province" status throughout the province, enabling more than 11.16 million people in the province to break away from illiteracy and victoriously complete the task of literacy eradication. This is a heartening and joyous event. This fact once again eloquently proves that as long as right-leaning conservative thinking in leadership can be overcome and the masses can be fully mobilized, a great leap forward in cultural revolution will inevitably occur simultaneously with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. In the process of completing the literacy campaign in Henan Province, because some advanced areas and advanced young and middle-aged people in general areas have already broken away from illiteracy ahead of time, displayed conscious labor enthusiasm, initially shown creative wisdom, and begun to embark on the path of cultural revolution, this is one of the main reasons why the development of industrial and agricultural production is relatively fast and vigorous, and the realization of people's communes is relatively rapid, in the current upsurge of the overall leap forward in socialist construction.
	The main characteristic of the literacy campaign in Henan Province is that while the whole Party attaches importance to strengthening leadership and fully relying on the people, it also correctly implements the policy of education serving the politics of the proletariat and the combination of education and productive labor. It broke the mechanical class learning system, mechanically cramming literacy textbooks, the idea of production and learning competing for time (learning more in slack farming seasons, learning less in busy farming seasons, and not learning when extremely busy), and the conventional rules and one-sided views that this is mental labor and cannot adopt the blitzkrieg method of mass movements. It took the political tasks and production activities and cultural and health activities of a certain period as the main content of literacy learning and compiled them into teaching materials; it arranged all political life, production activities, cultural and health activities, and the most frequently contacted living places into an environment suitable for literacy learning; it compiled the requirements and indicators of political tasks, production tasks, and cultural and health activities into vivid and lively slogans, big-character posters, and rhythmic poems that mobilize power and inspire action; it organized all the cadres, teachers, primary and secondary school students, demobilized soldiers, intellectuals in the countryside, and civil school students who entered literacy learning earlier, who could serve the literacy campaign, to form a mighty army of literacy, a surging momentum of literacy, and launched a high tide of "everyone teaches, everyone learns" literacy learning, presenting a new look of "everyone learns culture, everywhere is the sound of reading" in rural areas and factories; it also immediately organized the young and middle-aged people who had broken away from illiteracy and already had an elementary school education into spare-time elementary schools and spare-time middle schools to continue to improve themselves, and later universally established red and expert universities throughout the province suitable for cadres and the masses to advance towards the road of being both red and expert. It truly is sweeping away a group, organizing a group, constantly improving on the basis of popularization, consolidating more firmly in the process of improvement, and making great contributions to rapidly promoting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and carrying out the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests. Today, when the province has victoriously completed the literacy task, thousands upon thousands of young and middle-aged people who broke away from illiteracy earlier have become agricultural harvest experts, steel smelting technicians, agricultural tool modification experts, and writers and poets who vividly reflect the political activities and production activities of real life. For example, Zhang Guangyi, a nationally renowned local expert, was able to liberate his thinking, break superstitions, learn from the cultural and scientific achievements of predecessors and other places, and engage in agricultural tool improvement and other creative inventions and literary creation activities only after breaking away from illiteracy. We can imagine that after the province has completed the literacy task, on the road ahead of fully launching the cultural revolution and technical revolution in the future, not only will larger and more satellites be launched in industrial and agricultural production, but also more magnificent brilliance will be emitted in culture and science.
	Today, when celebrating the victorious completion of the province's literacy task, further summarizing and applying more widely the working methods of the mass line that have been adopted in the literacy campaign and the experience of correctly implementing the Party's educational policy, in the new situation of the overall great leap forward in socialist construction, rapidly and on a larger scale carrying out the technical revolution and cultural revolution movement, effectively promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production, and continuing to launch more and higher bumper harvest satellites to accelerate the pace of socialist construction, is of extremely significant political significance.

    文化战线上的巨大光芒
    中共河南省委文教部副部长  苗化铭
    一定的文化，从来都是一定社会的政治和经济的反映，并为之服务的；两者的关系应该是而且从来就是相辅而行的。河南省在农业生产和钢铁生产方面连续放出巨大卫星和实现了人民公社化的同时，又在全省范围内基本实现“无文盲省”，使全省一千一百一十六万余人摆脱了文盲状态，胜利地完成了扫盲任务，这是一件振奋人心的大喜事。这一事实又一次雄辩地证明，只要能够克服领导上的右倾保守思想和充分地发动群众，在工农业生产大跃进的同时，就必然会出现文化革命的大跃进。河南省在完成扫盲任务的过程中，由于一部分先进的地区和一般地区先进的青壮年们已经提前摆脱文盲状态，发挥了自觉的劳动热情，初步显示出了创造智慧和开始踏上了文化革命的大道，这就是在当前的社会主义建设全面跃进的高潮中，工农业生产发展比较快、比较猛和实现人民公社化比较迅速的主要原因之一。
    河南省扫盲工作的主要特点是在全党重视加强领导和充分依靠人民群众的同时，又正确地贯彻执行了教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动结合的方针，打破了机械的班级学习制度、死啃扫盲课本、生产和学习争时间（农闲多学、农忙少学、大忙不学），以及认为这是精神劳动不能采用群众运动的突击方式等清规戒律和片面观点，把一定时期的政治任务和生产活动以及文化卫生活动作为扫盲学习的主要内容，编成教材；把一切政治生活、生产活动、文化卫生活动以及日常接触最多的生活场所，都布置成适合进行扫盲学习的环境；把政治任务和生产任务以及文化卫生活动的要求和指标都编写成生动活泼的有调动力量和鼓舞作用的标语、口号、大字报、快板诗；把一切可以为扫盲工作服务的下放干部、教师、中小学生、复员军人、在乡知识分子以及进入扫盲学习较早的民校学员都组织起来，形成千军万马的扫盲大军，波涛汹涌的扫盲声势，开展“万民教，全民学”的扫盲学习高潮，在农村和工厂中出现了“人人学文化，处处读书声”的新面貌；又把摆脱了扫盲状态和已经有了小学文化程度的青壮年们立即组织到业余小学和业余中学中去继续提高，以后又在全省范围内普遍地设立了适合干部和群众向又红又专的道路进军的红专大学。真正是扫一批组织一批，在普及的基础上不断提高，在提高的过程中更加巩固，并为迅速推进工农业生产大跃进和开展除四害讲卫生运动作出巨大贡献。在全省胜利完成扫盲任务的今天，已经有成千上万个摆脱文盲状态较早的青壮年变成了农业丰产能手、冶炼钢铁的技师、改造农具的专家以及生动地反映政治活动和生产活动现实生活的作家、诗人。如闻名全国的土专家张广义等，就是由于摆脱了文盲状态，才有可能解放思想，破除迷信，学习前人和外地的文化科学成就，而从事农具改良和其他创造发明以及文学创作活动。我们可以想像在全省完成了扫盲任务以后，在今后全面开展文化革命、技术革命的前进道路上，不仅在工农业生产上会放出更大更多的卫星，而且也将在文化科学方面发射出更为巨大的光芒。
    今天在庆祝全省扫盲任务胜利完成的时候，进一步总结和更加广泛地运用在扫盲工作中已经采用的群众路线的工作方法及正确地贯彻执行党的教育方针的经验，在社会主义建设全面大跃进的新形势下，迅速地和更大规模地开展技术革命和文化革命运动，有效地推动工农业生产的发展和继续放出更多更高的丰产卫星，以加快社会主义建设的发展速度，这是具有着极为重大的政治意义的。
