Creating More and Better New Products

　　The Wuxi Biochemical Enamel Factory and Hezong Glass Factory have recently achieved initial success in trial-manufacturing hard tempered glass bearing balls. The first batch of experimental glass balls has been installed on a three-horsepower ball mill, and the operation is good. According to preliminary estimates, the cost of this kind of ball is only a little more than one fen, which is much cheaper than iron balls.

    Currently, these two factories are continuing to experiment with manufacturing balls from advanced microcrystalline glass, which can have even higher hardness. These balls can be used in various machine tools. The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory recently successfully trial-produced a high-precision electronic dynamic balancing machine.

    After precision parts for high-precision machine tools, motors, steam turbines, aircraft, and high-speed rotating components are manufactured, they must be checked and adjusted by a dynamic balancing machine before they can be used. This dynamic balancing machine can check parts with a precision of 0.001 millimeters (equivalent to one-eightieth of the thickness of a human hair). Workers at the Iron Factory construction site of the Zibo City Construction Engineering Company in Shandong Province recently created an "electric brick grinding machine," which increased brick grinding efficiency by 59 times. This creation was jointly researched by veteran tile workers Chang Daolu and Chang Daofu, brothers, and advanced producer Yao Shutong. This machine is made up of a motor, a wooden machine tool, and a grinding wheel.

　　钢化玻璃制滚珠  老瓦工创磨砖机
　　无锡市生化搪瓷厂和合众玻璃厂最近试制硬质钢化玻璃轴承滚珠已初步成功。第一批试验性玻璃滚珠已经安装在三马力的球磨机上，运转情况良好。据初步估算，这种滚珠成本仅一分多钱，比铁制滚珠便宜得多。
    目前，这两个厂正在继续试验用高级微晶玻璃制造滚珠，硬度可以更高。这种滚珠可以在各种工作母机上使用。上海机床厂最近试制成功高精度电子动平衡机。
    高精度机床、电机、汽轮机、飞机和高速运转部件的精密零件制造出来以后，都要经过动平衡机校验调整以后才能使用。这台动平衡机，能够校验精密度达到零点零零一公厘（相当于一根头发丝的八十分之一）的部件。山东淄博市建筑工程公司铁厂工地职工最近创造了一种“电动磨砖机”，使磨砖效率提高五十九倍。这一创造是由老瓦工常道禄、常道福兄弟俩和先进生产者姚树桐共同研究进行的。这种机器用一个马达、一部木制机床加砂轮装成。
