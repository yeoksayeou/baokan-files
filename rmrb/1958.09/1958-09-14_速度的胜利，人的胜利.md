    The Victory of Speed, The Victory of People
    Zhang Pei
    Not long after the New Year this year, I came to Wuhan Iron and Steel. That day, drizzling rain mixed with snowflakes, Qingshan District was misty. It took me a long time to find the General Manager's office. An ordinary worker's dormitory was converted into the "headquarters" of this large construction site. General Manager Li Yiqing not only commanded here but also slept here. In a small room of only a dozen square meters, he introduced the construction scale of this large enterprise to me while taking out a few cents from his own pocket to ask someone to buy cigarettes to entertain me, a visitor from afar.
    "When will the iron be produced!" This is what a reporter most wants to know.
    Comrade Li Yiqing slowly said: "According to the original plan, this 1,386 cubic meter No. 1 blast furnace would be completed by July 1, 1959. Now it has been decided to complete it in eighteen months. But we also want to strive for further advancement and produce iron on October 1 this year." He took a puff of cigarette and continued: "But there are still many difficulties. Tens of thousands of tons of equipment, some in factories far away in the Soviet Union, some scattered in manufacturing across the country. If we move up the schedule again, we will have to change their plans. The technical force is very insufficient, there are not many experienced welders..." He took another puff, and said deeply: "As long as the rectification campaign is carried out well, cadres live in the work sheds, and the masses are mobilized, there will be a solution!"
    In addition to considering the date of October 1st, the General Manager also has to consider a series of huge and complex issues. This is not building an ordinary residence, but a world-class blast furnace. Seven to eight hundred thousand tons of molten iron will flow from this furnace every year. But the news reporter's consideration is much simpler: report the ambition of the builders of Wuhan Iron and Steel, and let the people of the whole country support and encourage them.
    Coming out from the General Manager's office, I rushed to the blast furnace construction site and saw workers hoisting the blast furnace body in the half-empty cold wind. In the early days of the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, I visited the construction sites of its No. 7 and No. 8 blast furnaces (those two furnaces were much smaller than the No. 1 blast furnace here) several times, and had a little superficial knowledge of blast furnaces. I understand that the construction of a modern blast furnace is not just the furnace body itself, but a series of construction projects to be carried out. In addition to coking and refractory materials, there are also hot blast stoves, underground pipelines, instrument control equipment, ventilation, gas, electricity, water..., it is simply as complex as a nervous system. But now these are still far behind. I calculated that there were only eight months left until October 1st. I considered whether to report this fighting goal - producing iron on October 1st. Because a reporter cannot be a reckless person. But Comrade Li Yiqing's words were attacking me: "As long as the rectification campaign is carried out well, cadres live in the work sheds, and the masses are mobilized, there will be a solution!" I have no reason to doubt this power. That night, I wrote a news item and sent it to the newspaper by telegram, reporting that Wuhan Iron and Steel was striving to produce iron on October 1st.
    Since then, time has passed day by day, and the pace of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture across the country has become more and more magnificent. Because I had a reporting relationship with Wuhan Iron and Steel once, it seemed that I had some responsibility. After returning to Beijing, I always liked to inquire about the news of Wuhan Iron and Steel. Sure enough, "cadres live in the work sheds, and the masses are mobilized, there will be a solution." The construction speed of Wuhan Iron and Steel has also accelerated day by day. At this time, there is nothing more to doubt. Doing what is said is the simple style of the working class. Maybe it can be brought forward some time earlier!
    But until today, there are still some people who don't believe or simply don't believe in this speed. Because this furnace is technically a first-class blast furnace in the world, the Western bourgeoisie pays close attention to it. It is of course just boasting that the Chinese want to build such a large blast furnace in such a short time. Let's not talk about these, because since it is the Western bourgeoisie, its mind is different from ours. The problem is that some of our people also had some "different opinions." One of these opinions is: The construction of modern large-scale enterprises can only be done slowly, and cannot be as fast as local industries. That is to say, it must take twenty months to build this blast furnace. This means that this is an objective law. And the law does not change with people's will. It would be untrue to arbitrarily think that comrades with this view have no basis at all. Seventy thousand tons of equipment, one hundred and eight kilometers of pipelines, two hundred thousand cubic meters of concrete, not a ton less, not a kilometer less, not a cubic meter less, and iron cannot be produced. Twenty months were calculated in this way, this is a fact.
    However, they have a major shortcoming, or rather a great one-sidedness. They calculated the tonnage of steel equipment, calculated the length of cable pipelines, calculated the cubic meters of concrete, and also calculated the usual labor efficiency (these should all be calculated), but they did not calculate what a completely different situation would arise after the subjective initiative of people is fully exerted.
    When we say this, perhaps some comrades will stand up and point their fingers at our noses and say: Doesn't this mean that people's will can change objective laws? Isn't this subjective idealism?
    In fact, this is also extremely one-sided, and can even be said to be a distortion. All subjective idealism, or the "subjective fighting spirit" "advocated" by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, is unrelated to true Marxists. We are only explaining that the dynamism of people pointed out in dialectical materialism can have a reverse effect on the material base.
    Then, can the law be changed? Of course not. However, first of all, we must see whether this is a true objective law, and secondly, under what conditions the law is produced.
    Under certain production relations and a certain state of mind, or ideological conditions, the laws can be different.
    If the cadres of Wuhan Iron and Steel are still high above, full of bureaucratic airs, if Wuhan Iron and Steel has not mobilized the masses and people's enthusiasm is very poor, then it can be said with certainty that even if domestic and foreign equipment arrives on time, the No. 1 blast furnace may not be able to produce iron even if it takes twenty months. This is an objective law. In this case, wanting to be fast cannot be fast, the law cannot be changed, there is nothing to do, it has to be twenty months, or even more.
    But cadres live in the work sheds, work with the masses, mobilize all the masses, and with the early arrival of domestic and foreign equipment, the blast furnace was built in fourteen months. This is another objective law. This is the law of the Great Leap Forward, the law of high-speed construction.
    More than a year ago, on a vast open field on the bank of the Yangtze River, now (eighteen days earlier than October 1st) the molten iron of the No. 1 blast furnace is flowing out with a roar. Although far away in Beijing, I can't help but recall that cold spring day again. In that small room, I had a conversation with Li Yiqing, General Manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel: "...There are many difficulties,...there is a solution when the masses are mobilized..." This is true. The completion of the No. 1 blast furnace proves that this is an immutable law. And in the history of our entire Party's revolution, which victory has not been achieved through the process of "many difficulties, there is a solution when the masses are mobilized"?
    Now, it seems that I can hear the roaring sound of the molten iron of the No. 1 blast furnace. This sound tells people: At the same time as thousands of small blast furnaces are being built, the Party's General Line has achieved another victory - the victory of the completion of a large blast furnace. This is the victory of speed. And speed is determined not by machines or cement, but created by people, by the victory of people armed with communist ideology!

    速度的胜利，人的胜利
    张沛
    今年新年刚刚过去不久，我来到了武钢。那一天，细雨里夹着雪粒，青山区雾霭迷蒙，找了很久，才找到总经理办公的地方。一座普通的职工宿舍改成了这个大工地的“指挥部”，总经理李一清同志既在这儿指挥，又在这儿睡觉。在一个只有十几平方公尺的小房间里，他向我一边介绍这个大企业的建设规模，一边自己掏腰包拿出几毛钱找人去买香烟，招待我这个远道来客。
    “什么时候出铁呀！”这是一个记者最想知道的事情。
    李一清同志缓缓地谈着：“按照原来的计划是到1959年7月1日建成这个一千三百八十六立方公尺的一号大高炉，现在已经决定提前到十八个月建成。可是我们还想争取再提前，在今年的10月1日出铁。”他抽了一口烟，接着说：“可是困难还是很多，几万吨设备，有的远在苏联的工厂，有的分散在全国各地制造，我们再提前，就要改变人家的计划。技术力量很不够，有经验的电焊工没有几个……”他又抽了一口烟，深沉地说：“只要把整风搞好，干部住到工棚子去，群众动起来就有办法！”
    总经理除了考虑10月1日这个日子以外，还要考虑一连串巨大的复杂的问题。这不是建筑一所普通的住宅，而是一座世界上第一流的大高炉。每年要从这个炉子里流出七、八十万吨铁水。可是新闻记者考虑的却简单得多：把武钢建设者的雄心报道出去，让全国人民都来支援它、鼓励它。
    从总经理那儿出来，我又赶到高炉工地上去，看见工人们正在半空的寒风中吊装高炉炉体。在鞍钢建设的初期，我几次去过那儿的七号、八号高炉的工地（那两个炉子比这儿的一号高炉要小得多），对高炉有一点皮毛的知识。我了解近代化的大高炉的建设并不光是炉体本身，有一连串的建设要搞。除了炼焦、耐火材料等等以外，还有什么热风炉、地下管道、仪表控制设备，什么通风、通气、通电、通水……，简直像神经系统一样地复杂。可是现在这些还差得很远。我算了一算，到10月1日只有八个月多一点。我考虑要不要把这个斗争目标——10月1日出铁报道出去。因为一个记者不能是一个冒失鬼呀。可是李一清同志的几句话在向我进攻：“只要把整风搞好，干部住到工棚子去，群众动起来就有办法！”我没有理由怀疑这个力量。当天晚上，我写了一条新闻用电报发给报社，报道武钢争取在10月1日出铁。
    从那以后，时间一天天地过去，而全国工农业大跃进的步伐也一天比一天雄壮。因为和武钢发生过一次报道关系，好像就有点儿什么责任，回到北京以后，总喜欢常常向人打听武钢的消息，果然“干部住到工棚子去，群众动起来就有办法”，武钢建设的速度也一天比一天加快。这时更没有什么可怀疑了，说到哪里做到哪里，本来就是工人阶级的朴实作风，说不定还可能再提前一些时候呢！
    可是直到今天以前，也还有些人不大相信或者根本不相信这个速度。由于这个炉子在世界上来说，也是技术上头等的大高炉，因此，西方资产阶级很注意它。中国人要在这样短的时间中建成这样大的大高炉，当然只能是说大话。这些且不去谈它，因为既是西方资产阶级，它的心眼儿就和我们不一样。问题是我们的人也曾经有些“不同的看法”。这些看法之一就是：近代化的大型企业的建设，只能慢慢来，不能像地方工业那样说快就快。也就是说必须要二十个月才能建成这座大高炉。意思是这是个客观规律。而规律是不以人们的意志为转移的。如果武断地认为有这样看法的同志，没有任何一点根据，那也是不符合事实的。七万吨设备、一百零八公里的管道、二十万立方公尺的混凝土，少一吨、一公里、一立方公尺都出不了铁。二十个月就是这样计算出来的，这是事实。
    然而他们有一个重大缺点，或者说是很大的片面。他们计算了钢铁设备的吨数，计算了电缆管道的长度，计算了混凝土的立方公尺，也计算了通常的劳动效率（这些都是应当计算的），唯独没有计算人的主观能动性在充分发挥以后，会出现一个什么样的完全不同的状况。
    我们这样说，也许会有同志挺身而出，指着我们的鼻子说：你这不是等于说人的意志可以改变客观规律吗？这不是主观唯心论吗？
    其实这也是极大的片面，甚至可以说是曲解。一切主观唯心论或者像胡风反革命集团所“倡导”的“主观战斗精神”，和真正的马克思主义者是绝缘的，我们只不过是说明辩证唯物论中所指出的人的能动性能够反作用于物质基础而已。
    那末，规律可以改变吗？当然不能改变。然而第一要看这是不是真正的客观规律，第二，是在什么条件下产生的规律。
    在一定的生产关系和一定的人的精神状态或者说是意识形态的条件下，规律可以是不一样的。
    如果武钢的干部依然高高在上，官气十足，如果武钢没有发动群众，人们的干劲很差，那末可以肯定地说，即使国内外的设备按时到达，一号高炉即使用二十个月的时间也不一定能流出铁水。这是一种客观规律。在这样的情况下，想快也快不了，规律确实是无法改变，无可奈何，只好二十个月，或者更多一点时间。
    而干部住到工棚子中去，和群众一起劳动，把所有群众都发动起来，再加上国内外设备的提前到达，十四个月就把高炉建成了。这又是一种客观规律。这就是大跃进的规律，高速度建设的规律。
    一年多以前，扬子江边的一片空旷的原野上，现在（比10月1日又提前了十八天）一号高炉的铁水哗哗地流出来了。虽然远在北京，却不得不再一次回想起那个春寒料峭的日子，在那间狭小的屋子里，和武钢总经理李一清同志的谈话：“……困难很多，……群众动起来就有办法……”这是实在的，一号高炉的建成，证明了这才是无法改变的规律。而在我们全部党的革命的历史中，又有那一次胜利不是经过“困难很多，群众动起来就有办法”的过程来实现的呢？
    现在，我的耳边似乎响着一号高炉铁水奔腾的声音，这个声音告诉人们：和千万座小高炉建成的同时，党的总路线又取得了一次胜利——大型高炉建成的胜利，这是速度的胜利。而速度既不是机器也不是水泥决定的，而是人创造的，是用共产主义的意识形态武装起来的人的胜利！
