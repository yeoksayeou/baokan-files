Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: "Vigorously launch a mass movement of creation and criticism, enhance the communist ideological character of literature and art, and educate the broad masses of people with the communist spirit." The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, at a plenary meeting of its Presidium held on the 27th, issued this new call to literary and art workers across the country, based on the current situation of the Great Leap Forward nationwide.

The meeting was presided over by Mao Dun and Zhou Yang, Vice-Chairmen of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. More than 200 people attended the meeting, including Ba Jin, Lao She, Qian Junrui, Wei Chuantong, Zheng Zhenduo, Xia Yan, Tian Han, Shao Quanlin, Lü Ji, Ma Sicong, Wu Zuoren, Chen Huangmei, Zhou Libo, Ai Wu, and Feng Zhi. Some worker-authors from the capital and some students from the Chinese Departments of Peking University and Normal University also participated in the meeting.

The meeting first discussed the current development of literary and artistic work. The meeting believes that since this spring, with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the decisive victory in the anti-rightist struggle on the literary and artistic front, an unprecedentedly active and prosperous scene has appeared in literary and artistic creation in our country. The meeting highly valued the mass creation movement, believing that it marks a new stage in the development of literature and art in our country. The movement of criticism of bourgeois ideology in literary teaching and research work by middle school students in universities was also praised at the meeting. At the same time, the meeting pointed out that over the past year or so, many professional literary and art workers have responded to the call of the Party, gone down to the countryside and factories, integrated with the working masses, and written many works that have influence among the masses. The meeting called on literary and art workers across the country to exert their energy, continue to struggle, and create more and better works as a gift to celebrate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

The meeting believes that the Great Leap Forward in literature and art is first and foremost a leap forward in creation. At present, the task of the people of the whole country is to build socialism while preparing conditions for the transition to communism. Literary and art workers should be the pioneers of the times, and they should strive to create works rich in communist thought, to inspire the people of the whole country to build socialism with full confidence and make spiritual preparations for moving towards communism. Only in this way can literature and art undertake the glorious task of promoting the progress of the times. The meeting pointed out that demanding that literary and artistic works have communist ideology and beautiful artistic forms commensurate with it is the common goal of literary and artistic workers across the country. But at the same time, works with varying degrees of ideology and artistry are needed, and as long as they meet the six criteria pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong, they should be encouraged and supported.

The meeting believes that communist literary and artistic works should fully embody the spirit of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. The combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism is the manifestation of the combination of revolutionary spirit and realistic spirit in literature and art. Our literature and art should be the most authentic, and at the same time, the literature and art with the highest ideals.

The meeting also discussed the issue of popularization and improvement. The meeting believes that it is currently necessary to continue to carry out popularization work vigorously, and at the same time, to actively improve on the basis of popularization. The meeting criticized the erroneous ideas that still exist in the literary and art circles of belittling popularization and looking down on mass literature and art, and also criticized the one-sided view of ignoring improvement, fearing to talk about improvement, and believing that popularization itself is improvement. The meeting pointed out that only wanting improvement and not popularization, or only wanting popularization and not improvement, is being divorced from the masses and a manifestation of right-leaning conservative thinking of belittling the masses and not believing in the masses. Our policy should be popularization first, and the correct combination of popularization and improvement. It is not a closed-door improvement, but an improvement based on popularization. The mass creation movement and criticism movement should be further developed and be able to last and consolidate. On the basis of the mass creation movement, "cutting-edge" works will be produced through the joint efforts of literary and art workers and the masses. The meeting believes that the key to correctly solving the relationship between popularization and improvement lies in the true integration of literary and art workers and the working masses.

The meeting called on literary and art workers across the country to continue to go deep among the workers and peasants, combine with the masses, strengthen training, and improve their thinking. Literary and art workers should become models for the people in terms of thought, moral character, and life. At the meeting, many writers proposed that publishing houses and newspapers lower their manuscript fees, which will help literary and art workers reduce the distance from the working masses, overcome individualistic ideas of fame and profit, and make literary and art workers more mass-oriented and communist in terms of thoughts, feelings, and lifestyles.

The heads of the Ministry of Culture and literary, drama, art, music, and other groups who attended the meeting unanimously stated in their speeches that as long as they follow the spirit of the meeting, under the leadership of the Party, strive to improve their thinking, and implement the mass line, they will definitely be able to release a myriad of colorful flowers in literary and artistic creation. The Ministry of Culture, the Writers Association, and other literary and art groups are formulating plans and actively preparing forces to create more and better works in literature, film, drama, music, art, and other fields to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day next year.

### 增强文艺的共产主义思想性  开展群众的创作和批评运动  中国文联主席团扩大会议提出新的号召

    增强文艺的共产主义思想性
    开展群众的创作和批评运动
    中国文联主席团扩大会议提出新的号召
    据新华社29日讯  “大力开展群众的创作运动和批评运动，增强文学艺术的共产主义的思想性，用共产主义精神教育广大人民。”中国文学艺术界联合会在27日举行主席团扩大会议，根据目前全国大跃进的形势，向全国文学艺术工作者提出了这个新的号召。
    会议由中国文联副主席茅盾、周扬主持。出席会议的有巴金、老舍、钱俊瑞、魏传统、郑振铎、夏衍、田汉、邵荃麟、吕骥、马思聪、吴作人、陈荒煤、周立波、艾芜、冯至等二百多人。首都部分工人作者和北京大学、师范大学中文系部分同学也参加了这次会议。
    会议首先讨论了目前文学艺术工作发展的形势。会议认为：今春以来，随着工农业生产大跃进和文艺战线上反右派斗争取得决定性的胜利，我国文学艺术创作出现了一个空前活跃和繁荣的景象。会议对群众创作运动给以极高的估价，认为它标志着我国文艺发展的一个新阶段。高等学校中学生们对文艺教学和研究工作中的资产阶级思想的批判运动也在会上受到了赞扬。同时会议指出，一年多来，许多专业的文艺工作者，响应党的号召，纷纷下乡下厂，和劳动群众结合，写出了许多在群众中有影响的作品。会议号召全国文艺工作者鼓足干劲，继续奋斗，创作出更多更好的作品，作为迎接伟大的建国十周年的献礼。
    会议认为，文学艺术的大跃进，首先是创作的跃进。目前全国人民的任务是建设社会主义，同时准备条件向共产主义过渡。文学艺术工作者应该做时代的先锋，他们应该努力创作出富有共产主义思想的作品，鼓舞全国人民满怀信心地建设社会主义并为走向共产主义做好精神准备。只有这样，文艺才能担负起推动时代前进的光荣任务。会议指出，要求文艺作品具有共产主义的思想和与之相适应的优美的艺术形式，是全国文学艺术工作者共同努力的目标。但同时也需要各种不同程度的思想性和艺术性的作品，只要是符合毛泽东同志所指出的六条标准的，都应该得到鼓励和支持。
    会议认为共产主义的文艺作品应当充分体现革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的精神。革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合，也就是革命精神和求实精神相结合在文艺上的表现。我们的文艺应当是最真实的，同时又是具有最高理想的文艺。
    会议还讨论了普及与提高的问题。会议认为：目前需要继续大力进行普及工作，同时要在普及基础上积极提高。会议批判了文艺界还存在着的轻视普及、看不起群众文艺的错误思想，也批判了忽视提高，怕讲提高，认为普及本身就是提高的片面看法。会议指出：只要提高，不要普及，或者只要普及，不要提高，都是脱离群众的，都是轻视群众，不相信群众的右倾保守思想的表现。我们的方针应当是普及第一，普及和提高正确结合。不是关门提高，而是在普及基础上提高。群众的创作运动和批评运动应当得到进一步的发展，并且能够持久和巩固下来。在群众创作运动的基础上经过文艺工作者和群众的共同努力产生出“尖端”的作品。会议认为，要正确地解决普及和提高的关系，关键在于文艺工作者和劳动群众的真正结合。
    会议号召全国文艺工作者，继续深入工农群众，和群众结合，加强锻炼，提高思想。文艺工作者在思想上、道德品质上和生活上都应该成为人民的表率。会上，许多作家提议出版社和报刊降低稿酬，这将有助于文艺工作者减少和劳动群众的距离，克服个人主义的名利观念，使文艺工作者在思想感情和生活方式上更加群众化、共产主义化。
    出席会议的文化部和文学、戏剧、美术、音乐等团体的负责人，在会上发言时，一致表示，只要根据会议的精神，在党的领导下，努力提高思想，贯彻群众路线，一定能在文艺创作上放出万紫千红的花朵。文化部、作家协会和其他各文艺团体都在制定规划，积极准备力量，为迎接明年国庆十周年创作出更多更好的文学、电影、戏剧、音乐、美术等各方面的作品而奋斗。
