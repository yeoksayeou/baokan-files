The following article is a column item.

This spring, unexpected news spread through the Eighth Company of a certain division stationed in Yunnan: Division Political Commissar He Yunfeng and Deputy Division Commander Zhang Huamin were coming to their company to serve as soldiers!

The entire company was immediately stirred:

"Such high-ranking leaders are coming to be soldiers?"

"What should we do if they really come?"

"Don't worry, we just need to take good care of the leaders."

"With the political commissar and deputy division commander serving in our company, our company will surely progress even faster."

The soldiers tidied their rooms again and again, arranging their clothes neatly, preparing to warmly welcome their "leader-soldiers."

At dusk, the political commissar and the division commander arrived with several cadres, all wearing soldiers' uniforms. Unexpectedly, the division political commissar and deputy division commander saluted Deputy Company Commander Zhang Fucai, who was in the office, indicating that they would truly become soldiers in the company.

The political instructor announced the order in front of the company: Private He Yunfeng to the First Squad, Zhang Huamin to the Fourth Squad. The soldiers of the First and Fourth Squads enthusiastically welcomed these two new soldiers to their barracks.

When He Yunfeng arrived at the First Squad, it was almost lights out, and the soldiers were making his bed. The division political commissar asked, "Comrades, who is my squad leader?" Squad Leader Huang Guiyou stood up hesitantly and replied, "It's me." The division political commissar said, "Squad Leader Comrade, please teach me well and manage me boldly." Then he introduced himself to all the comrades, asking everyone to call him He Yunfeng from now on.

The next day, when he got up to tidy his bedding, He Yunfeng couldn't make his big quilt look as good as the soldiers' quilts. Squad Leader Huang Guiyou tidied his own quilt and came over to say, "Leader Comrade, let me do it." He Yunfeng immediately said, "Squad Leader Comrade, don't call me 'leader' anymore, just call me He Yunfeng." It seemed that the squad leader couldn't manage to tidy the big quilt either. When He Yunfeng returned from morning exercises, he went to exchange it for a small quilt. But when he looked at his bed after breakfast, the big quilt was still there. He asked the squad leader, who said seriously, "Leader Comrade, you are older and can't use a thin quilt, what if you get sick?" But He Yunfeng said, "Coming to serve as a soldier is about being the same as the soldiers, otherwise what kind of training is it?" In the end, he exchanged the small quilt back.

Within a few days of the division political commissar and deputy division commander arriving at the squad, their exemplary actions had left a deep impression on the soldiers. They strictly observed discipline, asking the squad leader for leave whether they were going to a meeting or buying a pack of cigarettes; they competed to sweep the floor in the morning; and they always threw cigarette butts into the spittoon. The division political commissar always came back late at night after meetings, when all the comrades in the squad were already asleep. As soon as the division political commissar came in, he would check each bed, covering those who had not covered themselves well. In addition, they helped the soldiers read and write letters.

New recruit Wang Guofu was not used to life in the army, especially being afraid of walking. Deputy Division Commander Zhang Huamin approached him and helped him in every way. When he couldn't run, he would support him. Wang Guofu was very moved. He said, "When I think of the leader, my enthusiasm increases." He and the deputy division commander were even closer than family members, often holding the deputy division commander's hand, touching the deputy division commander's shoulder, chatting about everything, big and small, family matters, things in his heart, everything.

During field tactical training, the deputy division commander served as both a soldier and a commander, lecturing and demonstrating to the soldiers while also participating in operations. The deputy division commander walked as much as the soldiers walked; climbed as high as the soldiers climbed; and while the soldiers rested, he was working – surveying the exercise site and writing lesson plans. In the "residential area" offensive exercise, he took the lead in carrying trees and building ladders with the soldiers, using a tree to build a wall ladder more than ten feet high. He was the first to climb up, demonstrating how to pass the high wall obstacle. When the soldiers saw that the leader had passed, even those who were somewhat timid were no longer afraid.

In the first few days of training, the squad discussed the training targets set by the division party committee. From this discussion, the division political commissar saw that the training mobilization was not yet very thorough, so he deeply helped the soldiers solve the problems of "Why leap forward?", "Where to leap forward?", and "How to leap forward?". From then on, everyone's enthusiasm increased even more. During field tactical training, the deputy division commander, in addition to influencing the soldiers with exemplary actions, also helped the company carry out mass political mobilization work, which not only aroused everyone's enthusiasm but also increased the ideological nature of the training subjects, greatly promoting the training work. In the field, the Eighth Company completed 206 hours of training tasks in only 84 hours, achieving excellent results.

During the individual soldier teaching process, the division political commissar and deputy division commander listened to platoon leader Zhang Zhifu's lecture together with the soldiers. The platoon leader spoke too deeply, and the soldiers couldn't understand it. After the two discussed it, the deputy division commander helped the platoon leader prepare the lesson. Before the lecture, a soldiers' symposium was held to understand their characteristics. During the preparation, the soldiers' slang and colloquialisms were combined with military terms, and various image-based teaching aids and intuitive teaching methods were created. In this way, the soldiers could not only understand what the platoon leader was saying, but also found it very interesting.

The division political commissar and deputy division commander also often played ball with the soldiers, danced with ethnic minority soldiers, and talked with the soldiers. The soldiers also liked to talk to them about any problems they had. The squad and platoon cadres felt that they were not only educated ideologically, but also greatly improved in their work methods. They said that the leaders had helped them with many specific tasks, and they had also learned how to do specific work. Under the influence of the division political commissar and deputy division commander, they also chatted with the soldiers about their families, and their relationship with the soldiers was closer than before.

During the days when Political Commissar He Yunfeng and Deputy Division Commander Zhang Huamin were serving as soldiers in the company, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of officers and soldiers to strive for the top was even greater, and they expressed that they would learn from the leaders' work style of going deep into the masses. Deputy Company Commander Wang Jinping of the Seventh Company voluntarily moved into the squad to live, rolling and crawling with the soldiers. The artillery company cadres carried the artillery themselves in the mud and water to demonstrate the movements to the soldiers. The logistics department also changed its past "talking without doing" style, achieving "going deep into reality, doing it yourself, being available whenever called, handling it as soon as you arrive, and handling it even if they don't come to you." The veterinary director also moved to the veterinary station. The finance director delivered the salaries to the doors of the companies and cadres. Leaders at all levels going down to the company to serve as soldiers, and people from all walks of life going down to the grassroots to do practical work, has become a trend in this army.

The soldiers said, "Whatever we think in our minds, the cadres know it clearly, they are really our good comrades, good brothers, and good superiors." (Xinhua News Agency)

    师长政委当兵记
    杨国星　章皆淳
    今年春天，一件出人意外的消息传到了驻云南部队某师八连，说是师政治委员何云峰和副师长张化民要来他们连队当兵！
    整个连队顿时轰动了：
    “这样大的首长还来当兵？”
    “要是真的来了怎样办哪？”
    “不怕，只要好好照顾首长就可以啦。”
    “政委、副师长到咱们这里当兵，咱们这个连队保险进步得更快。”
    战士们把内务整了又整，衣服收拾得整整齐齐，他们准备着要好好地迎接自己的“首长兵”。
    黄昏，政委和师长带着几个干部来了，他们都穿着士兵的衣服。出人意外地师政委和副师长向正在办公的副连长张福财敬了礼，这表示，他们将真正成为连队的士兵。
    指导员在队前宣布了命令：列兵何云峰到一班，张化民到四班。一班和四班的战士们热情地把这两位新兵拥到他们的营房去了。
    何云峰到一班时，已是快熄灯的时候了，战士们正为他铺床。师政委问道：“同志们，谁是我的班长？”班长黄贵友拘拘束束地站了起来，回答说：“是我。”师政委说：“班长同志，请你好好地教我，大胆地管理我。”接着他又向全班的同志作了自我介绍，要大家以后都叫他何云峰。
    第二天起床整理内务，何云峰没有能够把他那大被子搞得和战士们的一样。班长黄贵友整理好自己的被子走了过来说：“首长同志，叫我来整。”何云峰马上说：“班长同志，以后可不要叫首长，就叫我何云峰。”看来班长也没有办法能把这床大被子弄好。何云峰出操回来，就去换了床小被子。可到他吃完早饭一看，床上放着的还是那床大被子。他就问班长，班长严肃地说：“首长同志，你年纪大，不能盖薄被子，冻病了怎么行。”但何云峰却说：“来当兵就是要同士兵一致，不然还叫什么锻炼？”结果还是把小被子换了回来。
    师政委和副师长来到班上没两天，他们的模范行动就给战士们留下了深刻的印象。他们非常遵守纪律，不论是去开会或买包烟都要向班长请假；早上争着扫地；烟头总是丢在痰盂里。师政委总是开会开到深夜才回来，到班上，同志们早睡熟了。师政委一进来就一个床铺一个床铺地看一遍，没盖好被子的给盖上。此外他们还帮战士们看信、写信。
    新战士王国富刚来部队，生活很不习惯，特别是怕走路。张化民副师长就很好地和他接近，从各方面帮助他。跑不动时，就扶着他走。王国富很受感动。他说：“我一想到首长干劲也大了。”他和副师长真是比家里人还亲，常常拉着副师长的手，摸摸副师长的肩，说长道短，家里的事，自己心中的事，大大小小都说给副师长听。
    在野营战术训练中，副师长既当兵又当指挥员，他给战士们讲课，给战士们示范，同时还参加操作。战士走多少路，他走多少路；战士爬多高的山，他爬多高的山；战士休息的时候，他却在工作——勘察演习场地，编写教案。在“居民地”进攻演习中，他带头和战士们抬树木搭梯子，用一棵树搭成丈多高的墙梯。他第一个爬了上去，示范通过高墙障碍动作。战士们看到首长都过去了，就是有些胆怯的也都不再害怕了。
    训练刚开始的几天，班里对师党委制定的训练指标作了讨论。从这次讨论会中，师政委看出了训练动员还是做得不很深入，他就深入地帮助战士们解决“为什么跃进？”“向那里跃进？”“如何跃进？”等问题。从此大家的干劲都更大了。在野营战术训练中，副师长除以模范行动影响战士外，还帮助连队开展了群众性的政治鼓动工作，不仅激起了大家的劲头，也增加了训练科目的思想性。大大地推动了训练工作。八连在野营中仅八十四小时就完成了二百零六小时的训练任务，成绩达到了良好。
    在单兵教学过程中，师政委、副师长和战士一起听排长张志福讲课。排长讲得很深，战士接受不了。他们两人商量后就由副师长去帮助排长备课。讲课前召开了战士座谈会，了解他们的特点，备课中把战士们的土语、俗话和军事术语结合起来，并创造了各种形象化的教具和直观教学的方法。这样一来，排长讲的课战士们不但能懂，而且觉得很有趣味了。
    师政委和副师长还经常和战士一起打球，和少数民族战士一道跳舞，和战士们谈心，战士有什么问题也喜欢找他们谈。班、排干部都觉得不但思想上受到教育，在工作方法上也有很大的提高。他们说，许多具体工作，首长都帮我们做了，我们也学会了做具体工作了。在师政委和副师长的影响下，他们也和战士们拉家常，和战士的关系比过去更加亲密了。
    何云峰政委和张化民副师长在连队当兵的日子里，广大官兵力争上游的干劲更大了，纷纷表示要学习首长们深入群众的工作作风。七连副连长王金平同志自动搬到班里去住，同战士一起摸、爬、滚、打。炮连干部自己扛着炮在泥里水里给战士作示范动作。后勤处也改变了过去“动口不动手”的作风，做到了“深入实际、亲自动手、随叫随到、随到随办，不来找就找着办”。兽医主任也搬到兽医所去住。财务主任把薪金送到连队、干部的门上。各级首长下连队当兵，各行各业下到基层做实际工作，已经成了这个部队的一种风气。
    战士们说：“我们脑子一想啥，干部都知道得清清楚楚的，真是自己的好同志，好兄弟，好上级。”　（新华社）
