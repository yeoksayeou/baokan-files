Xinhua News Agency, 14th. "Red Flag" magazine, issue number eight, to be published on September 16th, will carry an editorial entitled "U.S. Aggressors Are Putting the Noose Around Their Own Necks." This editorial elaborates on the points made by Chairman Mao in his speech at the 15th Supreme State Conference. The editorial begins by stating: "History has prepared a tragic role for all imperialist reactionaries, destined for them to diligently create their own gravediggers. The more ruthless and wicked they are, the more they will incite the revolutionary fighting spirit of the people. The more their scope of aggression expands, the more nooses are placed around their necks. The more frantic their provocative activities, the tighter the noose controlled by the people will be pulled. If the U.S. aggressors continue to adhere to the policy of making nooses to put around their own necks, the day they are sentenced to hanging by the people of the world will be ever closer."

The editorial says: "The U.S. aggressors, who are making nooses and putting them around their own necks, every time they create a tense situation, the result is that they are increasingly mobilizing the awareness and enthusiasm of the people of the world, prompting the people of all countries who control the other end of the noose to tighten it more and more. In the tense situations constantly created by the U.S. aggressors, the people of the world, including some who were originally unclear, will gradually see clearly that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of world peace, and everyone will increasingly clearly express their attitude on the issue of war and peace." The editorial said, "For the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world, Dulles is truly worthy of being the best 'negative teacher'. His persistent policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and hostility towards the people of the world constantly arouses ever greater anti-American anger and a spirit of奮發圖強 among the Chinese people and the people of the world. On this point alone, it can be said that Dulles has indirectly done beneficial work for the revolutionary cause of China and the world and should be given a medal."

The editorial stated, "Recently, U.S. imperialism's attempt to expand its aggression against Jinmen, Mazu, and other inland islands of our country is merely a continuation and development of its consistent determination to be an enemy of the Chinese people. The Chinese people love peace, but if the U.S. aggressors insist on forcing us to wage war, the Chinese people will never be afraid of war. If the U.S. aggressors insist on provoking a world war, then, as we have repeatedly said for many years, there is no doubt that the result of the war will be the complete destruction of the entire imperialist system and the great victory of world lasting peace and the cause of human progress." The editorial concludes, "The recent decades, especially the recent ten years, have been a period full of revolutionary events and revolutionary victories. Large areas of what imperialism originally regarded as solid cornerstones have suddenly collapsed. Imperialists can never stop this process, because their policies objectively are always accelerating this process."

The eighth issue of "Red Flag" also published Wu Zhipu's "From Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives to People's Communes", the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee's instructions on the establishment of People's Communes, Jiang Nanxiang's "The Party's Education Policy Promotes the Revolution in Institutions of Higher Learning", Liang Hanbing's "Part-Work Part-Study is the Best Form of Combining Education and Productive Labor", Yao Yuanbao's "Shanxi Machine Tool Factory Runs a Red and Expert University", Zhao Shouyi's "A Great Leap Forward on the Cultural and Educational Front", and other articles.

### 美国侵略者自己套上了绞索  “红旗”杂志发表社论阐述毛主席讲话论点

    美国侵略者自己套上了绞索
    “红旗”杂志发表社论阐述毛主席讲话论点
    新华社14日讯　将在9月16日出版的“红旗”第八期上，发表了一篇题为“美国侵略者自己套上了绞索”的社论。这篇社论是阐述毛主席在第十五次最高国务会议上讲话的论点的。社论首先指出：“历史为一切帝国主义反动派准备了一个悲剧的角色，注定他们要努力制造自己的掘墓人。他们愈是穷凶极恶，结果就愈加激发人民的革命斗志。他们的侵略范围愈是扩大，套在他们脖子上的绞索就愈来愈多。他们的挑衅活动愈是疯狂，被人民控制了的绞索就愈拉愈紧。美国侵略者如果继续坚持制造绞索套自己脖子的政策，它被全世界人民宣判绞刑的日子也就愈益临近了。”
    社论说：“自己制造绞索套在自己脖子上的美国侵略者，每一次制造紧张局势，结果都是日益紧张地把全世界人民的觉悟性、积极性动员起来，促使那些控制着绞索另一端的各国人民日益将绞索拉紧。在美国侵略者不断制造的紧张局势中，全世界人民，包括一些原来认识不清的人们，都会逐步看清楚美帝国主义是世界和平的最凶恶的敌人，每一个人在战争和和平的问题上都日益明确地表明自己的态度。”社论说，“对于中国人民和世界各国人民来说，杜勒斯真称得起是最好的‘反面教员’。他所坚持的敌视中国人民和敌视世界人民的政策，经常在中国人民和世界人民中，激起愈来愈大的抗美怒潮和奋发图强的斗志。就凭这一点，可以说，杜勒斯是为中国和世界各国革命事业间接地做了有益的工作，应当给他一个勋章。”
    社论说，“最近美帝国主义企图对金门、马祖等我国内海岛屿扩大侵略，不过是它一贯决心与中国人民为敌的继续和发展。中国人民是热爱和平的，但是，如果美国侵略者一定要强迫我们进行战争，中国人民决不害怕战争。美国侵略者如果一定要挑起世界战争，那么正如我们多年来反复说过的，毫无疑问，战争的结果，必然是整个帝国主义体系的彻底毁灭，必然是世界持久和平和人类进步事业的伟大胜利。”社论最后说，“最近几十年，特别是最近十几年，乃是充满着革命事件和革命胜利的时期。帝国主义原来当作稳固的基石的地方，一大片一大片地突然崩陷。帝国主义者绝对不能阻止这个过程，因为他们的政策客观上永远是在加速这个过程”。
    “红旗”第八期还发表了吴芝圃的“由农业生产合作社到人民公社”、中共河北省委关于建立人民公社的指示、蒋南翔的“党的教育方针促进了高等学校的革命”、梁寒冰的“半工半读是教育和生产劳动相结合的最好形式”、药远保的“山西机床厂办起了红专大学”、赵守一的“文教战线上的大跃进”等文。
