The Dong People Are Advancing
　　Liu Yangshen
　　The Dong ethnic group has a population of more than 800,000. They are scattered in more than 20 counties bordering Guizhou, Hunan, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, with more than half residing in Guizhou Province.

　　Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the Dong people, together with all ethnic groups in the country, have enjoyed a truly equal ethnic life in the unified family of the motherland. In the past few years, many autonomous organs have been established in various places: Guizhou Province has the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture; Hunan Province has the Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County and the Tongdao Dong Autonomous County; the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, etc. Most of the leading cadres in these areas are Dong people. Taking the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture in Guizhou as an example, since the establishment of the prefecture in July 1956, there have been more than 2,700 Dong cadres in the prefecture. In the State People's Committee, there are two Dong deputy governors and eight members; in the CPC State Committee, there are two Dong secretaries and five members. There are Dong cadres in all departments. From the central to the local levels, the National People's Congress at all levels has representatives of the Dong nationality.

　　In addition to growing rice and cotton, the Dong people also engage in forestry. They produce large quantities of timber, tung oil, tea oil, grain, and cotton. However, before liberation, farmland and forests were in the hands of landlords, and the lives of working people were very poor. After liberation, due to the implementation of land reform and the development of the cooperative movement, agricultural and forestry production has greatly developed. In Liping County, Guizhou Province, where the Dong people are most numerous, the average yield of grain per mu this year will reach more than 2,000 jin, and the average per capita grain ownership will be 3,000 jin. In 1950, each person had only more than 400 jin of grain. Forestry production is also developing year by year. During the first five-year plan period, the Dong and Miao people in the Qiandongnan area produced a total of 125 cubic meters of timber. The 30,000 Dong commune members in the forest area of Tianzhu County sold twice as much timber in the first ten months of last year as in 1956, with an average income of 43 yuan per household.

　　The Dong people have a long tradition of culture and art. The Dong people have their own language, and now, with the help of the Party and the state, they have created their own written language. They also have unique styles in architecture, music, and drama. People can see all kinds of Huilong Bridges everywhere in the Dong area. The bridges have corridor-style rain-sheltered walkways, and are painted with various patterns with ethnic characteristics. Each village has at least one drum tower, which serves as a place for the Dong people to gather and rest. The Dong people love to sing. Dong songs are not only beautiful and moving, but also closely and completely structured in terms of musical form; the performance forms are not only diverse and lively, but also multi-part melodies appear in the chorus, which is rare in folk songs of various ethnic groups in our country. Dong opera is developed from Dong songs. In the spring of 1955, the excellent Dong opera "Qin Niangmei" won the Excellent Performance Award at the National Mass Amateur Music and Dance Performance. Now Sanjiang and Tongdao have Dong opera professional troupes. In terms of education, there has also been unprecedented development since liberation. Taking Qiandongnan as an example, 93% of school-age children in the prefecture are enrolled in school. This August, the prefecture has basically eliminated illiteracy.

　　侗族人民在前进
　　刘扬深
    侗族共有八十多万人口。他们分居在贵州、湖南、广西僮族自治区交界毗连的二十多个县里，其中，居住在贵州省的，占一半以上。
    解放后，侗族人民在党的领导下，和全国各族人民一起，在祖国统一大家庭里，享受着真正民族平等的生活。几年来，各地先后建立了许多自治机关：贵州省有黔东南苗族侗族自治州；湖南省有新晃侗族自治县和通道侗族自治县；广西僮族自治区有三江侗族自治县等。这些地区的领导干部，大多数是侗族。以贵州黔东南苗族侗族自治州为例，自1956年7月建州以来，全州已有侗族干部二千七百多人。在州人民委员会里，有侗族副州长二人，委员八人；在中共州委会里，有侗族书记二人，委员五人。各个部门都有侗族干部。从中央到地方，各级人民代表大会都有侗族的代表。
    侗族人民除种植水稻、棉花外，还兼营林业。大宗出产木材、桐油、茶油、粮食和棉花。可是解放前，耕地和山林都操在地主手中，劳动人民生活非常贫困。解放后侗族人民由于实行了土地改革和开展合作化运动，农、林业生产有了很大发展。侗族最多的贵州省黎平县，今年粮食平均亩产将达二千斤以上，每人平均占有粮食三千斤。而1950年，每人只有粮食四百多斤。林业生产，也在逐年发展。在第一个五年计划期间，黔东南地区侗、苗族生产的木材共有一百二十五立方公尺。天柱县林区的三万户侗族社员，去年头十个月出售的木材，就等于1956年的两倍，平均每户收入四十三元。
    侗族人民，有着悠久的文化艺术传统。侗族人民有着自己的语言，现在又在党和国家帮助下，创立了自己的文字。在建筑、音乐、戏剧上也具有独特风格。人们在侗族地区，到处都可以看到各式各样的回龙桥，桥上有长廊式避雨走道，并画着各种富有民族特色的图案。每个村寨至少都有一个鼓楼，作为侗族人民集会和休息的场所。侗族人民都喜爱唱歌。侗歌不仅曲调优美动人，而且在曲式上紧密完整；演唱形式不仅多样活泼，而且在合唱中出现了多音部的旋律，这在我国各民族的民歌中是罕见的。侗戏是从侗歌的基础上发展起来的。1955年春，侗戏优秀剧目“秦娘梅”，在全国群众业余音乐舞蹈观摩演出会上，获得演出优秀奖。现在三汗、通道已有了侗戏职业剧团。在教育事业方面，解放后也有空前的发展。以黔东南为例，全州93％的学龄儿童都入了学。今年8月全州已基本上扫除了文盲。
