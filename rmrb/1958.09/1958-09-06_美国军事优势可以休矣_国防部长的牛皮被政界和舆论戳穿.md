　　U.S. Military Superiority Can Be Put to Rest
    The Defense Secretary's Boast Pricked by Politicians and Public Opinion
    (Reported by this newspaper) In order to threaten and intimidate the forces of world peace, U.S. Defense Secretary McElroy shamelessly boasted on the 2nd that he "with the fullest confidence," "at this time and in this place, in terms of overall existing military strength, the United States is ahead of the Soviet Union."

    The boast can be considered big enough. However, coincidentally, the day after McElroy's speech, former U.S. President Truman admitted that the United States had fallen behind the Soviet Union in weapons, missiles, and science. The Associated Press immediately pointed out: Truman's remarks had a "significant difference" from McElroy's speech. This is tantamount to implying that McElroy received a resounding slap in the face.

    Moreover, an increasing number of American bourgeois newspapers have had to admit that the U.S.'s policy of strength and deterrent power has long been bankrupt, and that the U.S. is far behind the Soviet Union in modern weaponry. An article in the "Christian Science Monitor" on August 30 revealed that in the military action of invading Lebanon, it "exposed the U.S.'s serious lack of certain new weapons, and the lack of sufficient transportation equipment needed to conduct even a small-scale conventional war." And "some U.S. weapons and equipment are actually inferior to the equipment purchased by Arab countries from the Soviet Union..."

    An editorial in the "Washington Post" on August 17 stated: "Some people are gleefully calling the U.S.'s new achievements in nuclear submarines the country's answer to the Soviet satellites. There is no comparison more misleading than this. It is extremely complacent to assume that we have eliminated the assumption of military backwardness from now on..."

### 美国军事优势可以休矣  国防部长的牛皮被政界和舆论戳穿

　　美国军事优势可以休矣
    国防部长的牛皮被政界和舆论戳穿
    本报讯　美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊为了对世界和平力量进行威胁和恫吓，在2日竟厚颜地吹嘘说：他“怀着最充分的信心”，“此时此地，在全面现有的军事力量方面，美国走在苏联前面。”
    牛皮可算吹得够大的了。可是，事有凑巧，就在麦克耳罗伊谈话的第二天，美国前总统杜鲁门却承认，美国不论在武器方面和导弹方面，或是在科学方面，都已落在苏联后面。美联社立刻指出：杜鲁门这番话同麦克耳罗伊的谈话有“显著的不同”。这就等于暗示，麦克耳罗伊吃了一记清脆的耳光。
    不仅如此，越来越多的美国资产阶级报刊也不得不承认，美国的实力政策和威慑力量早已破产，美国在现代化武器方面已经远远落在苏联后面了。“基督教科学箴言报”8月30日的一篇文章透露，在侵略黎巴嫩的军事行动中，“暴露美国严重地缺乏某些新式武器，缺乏进行一次甚至是小规模的常规战争所需要的足够运输工具。”而“美国某些武器和装备实际上不如阿拉伯国家从苏联购买的……装备。”
    8月17日的“华盛顿邮报”发表社论说：“有些人兴高采烈地把美国在核潜水艇方面的新成就称之为这个国家对于苏联人造卫星的回答。再没有比这种比拟更能叫人误入歧途了。我们从此消除了军事落后状态的假定是自满已极了……”
