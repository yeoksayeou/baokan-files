Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 21st—The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army's frontline forces in Fujian warmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement refuting Dulles's speech at the United Nations General Assembly. They firmly stated that they are ready at any time to await the orders of the motherland and fight heroically to resist aggression, safeguard the completeness of the motherland's territorial sovereignty, and defend world peace.
	
	Commanders and fighters of the frontline troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army expressed great anger at Dulles's shameless slander. Tian Feng, Chief of Staff of a certain artillery unit on standby duty on the Xiamen front, said that in order to cover up the United States' aggressive actions, Dulles openly and shamelessly described the Chinese people's military actions to punish the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched in Jinmen and Matsu as "aggression." This is a serious provocation to the Chinese people. We are defenders of peace, and no ferocious enemy can frighten us. If the American aggressive bandits dare to stubbornly confront us, we will smash their heads. Zhang Naiqian, squad leader of the Third Squad of the Fifth Company of a certain artillery unit, who was awarded a collective combat merit in the recent battle to punish the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, said that under the instigation of American aggressors, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on islands such as Jinmen and Matsu have continuously carried out frantic artillery attacks on the coastal areas of Fujian, causing great losses to the lives and property of the local people. We will never tolerate this situation continuing. No matter what blackmailing and intimidating methods Dulles uses, he cannot stop our determination to liberate Jinmen and Matsu.

	Zhang Yimin, Chief of Staff of a certain naval unit, said that the Chinese people have never succumbed to the war threats of imperialism. In order to oppose the aggression of Japanese imperialism, the Chinese people once launched a national war of resistance against Japan and achieved the final victory. If American imperialism insists on carrying out military aggression against the Chinese people, its fate will be even more tragic than that of Japanese imperialism. Liu Chunzhi, Political Commissar of a certain naval unit, said that the frontline troops will resolutely defend the motherland's territory and sovereignty from violation. If Jinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan are not liberated for a day, the frontline troops cannot stop fighting for a day.

	The heroic air force pilots on the front line also gathered to unanimously support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement. A former volunteer soldier who severely beat American air bandits on the Korean battlefield said angrily that American imperialism is a paper tiger and a "dog in the water," barking and biting everywhere now. If it does not accept the bitter lesson of its defeat on the Korean battlefield and dares to "offend the God of Plague," we will definitely beat it until its butt faces the sky and its mouth drills into the ground, never to return. A group of air force soldiers from a certain unit who are nervously studying how to fiercely attack the flying bandits of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique at the airport said: American war maniacs are still clamoring for atomic war, which can only scare some ignorant people and deceive themselves. We have the support and assistance of the powerful Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. Any enemy who dares to invade will be crushed to pieces.

    福建前线军民警告美国侵略者
    新华社福建前线21日电　中国人民解放军福建前线陆海空三军热烈拥护陈毅外交部长驳斥杜勒斯在联合国大会上发言的声明，他们坚决表示：随时等待着祖国的命令，为反抗侵略、维护祖国领土主权的完整和保卫世界和平而英勇作战。
    中国人民解放军前线部队的指挥员战斗员对杜勒斯的无耻谰言表示极大愤怒。正在厦门前线担任战备值勤的炮兵某部参谋长田丰传说，杜勒斯为了掩盖美国的侵略行动，竟公然无耻地把中国人民对盘踞金门、马祖的蒋贼军采取惩罚的军事行动说成是“侵略”，这是对中国人民的严重挑衅。我们是和平的保卫者，任何凶恶的敌人是吓不倒的。美国侵略强盗如果胆敢硬着头皮同我们碰，我们一定敲碎它的脑袋。在最近惩罚蒋贼军的战斗中荣立集体战斗功的炮兵某部五连三班班长张乃谦说，金门、马祖等岛上的蒋贼军在美国侵略者的指使下，不断对福建沿海地区进行疯狂炮击，使当地人民的生命财产遭受很大损失。我们决不能容忍这种情况继续下去，不管杜勒斯耍什么讹诈和恐吓的手段，都不能阻挡我们解放金门、马祖的决心。
    海军某部参谋长张逸民说，中国人民从来没有对帝国主义的战争威胁屈服过，为了反对日本帝国主义的侵略，中国人民曾经发动了全民性的抗日战争，并且取得了最后的胜利，如果美帝国主义坚持要对中国人民进行军事侵略，它的命运将比日本帝国主义更加悲惨。海军某部政治委员刘春志表示，前线部队将坚决保卫祖国的领土和主权不受侵犯，金门、马祖和台湾一天不解放，前线部队就一天不能停止战斗。
    前线英勇的空军健儿们也纷纷集会，一致拥护陈毅外交部长的声明。一位曾在朝鲜战场上狠狠地痛击过美国空中强盗的当年志愿军战士愤怒地说，美帝国主义是一只纸老虎又是一只“落水狗”，现在到处乱咬乱叫，如果它不接受在朝鲜战场上的惨败教训，胆敢在“太岁头上动土”，我们一定打得它屁股朝天，嘴巴钻地，有来无回。一群正在机场上紧张研究痛击蒋介石卖国集团飞贼的我某部空军战士们说：美国战争狂人还在叫嚣原子战争，这只能吓唬一些无知的人和欺骗自己，我们有强大的苏联和整个社会主义阵营的支持和援助，任何胆敢来侵犯的敌人都将被打得粉身碎骨。
