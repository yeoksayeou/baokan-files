    Congratulations on the Basic Elimination of Schistosomiasis in One Province and One Municipality

    The development of things is truly like the rolling Yangtze River, with wave after wave higher than the last. Under the leadership of the Party, our people began a large-scale battle to eradicate schistosomiasis in 1956. At that time, many people were still arguing about whether China could eliminate schistosomiasis, but in that year, six townships and towns had already emerged that had basically eliminated snails. In 1957, not only did townships and towns emerge that had basically eliminated schistosomiasis, but also fifteen counties that had basically eliminated schistosomiasis. This year, after only nine months, the work of preventing and controlling schistosomiasis has seen an unprecedented great leap forward. Now, not only have ninety-six new counties been added that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis, but also Fujian Province and Shanghai City, two provinces and cities that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis, have emerged. These two provinces and cities are two "satellites" launched this year by health work to celebrate the National Day. It seems that the day when schistosomiasis will be completely eliminated nationwide is not far off.

    Over the past few years, there has been a struggle between two lines in prevention and control work. Our Party, proceeding from China's actual situation, put forward the policy of active prevention and control and comprehensive measures. Its basic spirit is that both prevention and treatment are necessary, and prevention and treatment must adopt comprehensive measures. This is precisely a route to eliminate schistosomiasis with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. However, some people who worship bourgeois medical authorities have put forward a line that is in opposition to the Party, which is "prevention is the main thing, prevention is mainly snail eradication, and snail eradication is mainly drug snail eradication." Its basic spirit is to only prevent, not treat, and prevention is only snail eradication, and snail eradication is only one measure of drugs. This is a route of less, slower, worse, and more expensive results. When this route of less, slower, worse, and more expensive results was rejected by the Party, they arrogantly attacked the Party as being laymen who could not lead science. Who is correct after all? Let's look at the facts. Under the guidance of an expert who advocated snail eradication as the main thing, Shanghai County relied solely on drug snail eradication for several years, but it never reached the standard of basically eliminating snails. This year, Shanghai County pulled out the white flag of the bourgeoisie and planted the red flag of the proletariat, boldly mobilizing the masses and adopting various methods of snail eradication, including soil burial, grass removal, drugs, burning, and capture. Practice has proved that soil burial is the most effective, and other methods are only auxiliary. In this way, the standard of basic snail eradication was achieved within five months, and because the leadership met the urgent demands of the masses to rescue labor, and grasped the treatment work, the enthusiasm of the masses to fight against schistosomiasis was even greater. This county finally leaped to become a county that has basically eliminated schistosomiasis. Facts speak louder than words. Isn't it possible to compare which line is greater, faster, better, and more economical, and which line is less, slower, worse, and more expensive from this example?

    The great leap forward in prevention and control work this year is another arduous struggle to break down the bourgeois medical authorities and establish proletarian health work. Some people are superstitious about foreign countries and worship foreigners. In prevention and control work, they often increase the prestige of others and destroy their own ambition. You go to ask him how to kill snails, and his answer is: "Snails are a natural organism, and complete elimination is impossible. Some countries have developed medicine, and the epidemic area is small. They have been doing it for fifty years, and they still use cement to build river channels, and they still cannot eliminate them, let alone us?" You innovate the long-term treatment method, shortening it from twenty days to three days, and from three days to two days, and he will pour cold water again, "Foreign countries still use the forty-day treatment method today. Our twenty-day treatment method is already very advanced. It is too risky to shorten it further." In short, in their opinion, anything that foreigners have not done, Chinese people must not be able to do it. This is an extremely harmful pessimistic tone. Why do these people always increase the prestige of foreigners and destroy their own ambition? Why are they indifferent to the matter of rescuing the lives of thousands of laborers? There are two reasons. One is that they do not believe in the superiority of the socialist system, and they do not believe that our people, under the leadership of the Party, have the full power to fight against all diseases that harm mankind. The second is that they do not understand that socialist countries are different from capitalist countries. Capitalist countries do not value the lives of laborers, but we resolutely cannot tolerate schistosomiasis continuing to endanger the lives of laborers. Their tone of increasing the prestige of foreigners cannot withstand the facts of the great leap forward in prevention and control work. Please see how far they are from the times. For example: the epidemic area in Shanghai is 602 square kilometers, and there are 110,000 patients. Schistosomiasis was basically eliminated in more than two years; some capitalist countries have epidemic areas smaller than Shanghai, and fewer people than Shanghai, and it has taken four or fifty years to solve it. It can be seen from this that bourgeois medical authorities really have no authority to speak of, and the momentum of proletarian health work is truly great! The great leap forward in prevention and control work this year profoundly shows that our people not only have the power to eliminate schistosomiasis and accomplish things that no epidemic country in the world can do, but also can complete this matter at the high speed of the great leap forward.

    Launching a mass movement is the key to the great leap forward in prevention and control work this year. Some people oppose doing this. The reason is nothing more than "the masses do not understand science and technology" and "it is a waste of manpower and money." We believe that prevention and control work must launch a mass movement. The bigger the movement, the more wisdom and strength of the masses are concentrated, and the faster schistosomiasis can be eliminated. Due to the launching of a mass movement, technological innovations and inventions in prevention and control work this year have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. In terms of treatment, the most valuable thing is the high-efficiency treatment created by Liu Jintao and Huang Weiheng, young medical officers from Hunan Province, and several new medical instruments were made in the high-efficiency treatment movement. Before creating high efficiency, the highest record of a group treating patients per month was 150 people. Now, it has leaped to 6,000 people per month, a forty-fold increase, and there is no "waste of manpower and money" at all. Science and technology are not so "out of reach" for young people who are ideologically liberated. In the struggle to eliminate schistosomiasis, the working people have created many indigenous methods according to local conditions. Indigenous methods are not wrong, and some even surpass foreign methods. Large-scale water extraction and three-sided light soil burial of snails are unprecedented in international literature, but they are indeed more effective than the foreign method of drug snail eradication. We do not oppose foreign methods. We advocate combining indigenous and foreign methods. Large hospitals are certainly needed, but a drop in the bucket is of no avail. Therefore, temporary hospitals built by farmers with mao bamboo and thatch, and hospital beds made of door panels, are also indispensable. Combining Chinese and Western medicine is also our proposition. Someone once bet: "If Chinese medicine can cure schistosomiasis, I will kill my head for him." However, facts have proved that Chinese medicine does have its own unique advantages in treating patients in the advanced stages. As everyone knows, prevention and control work is a major matter related to the safety of 100 million people. Only by mobilizing all positive factors and developing all the creativity of the masses can we do this major matter quickly and well. Leaving the masses, monopolizing everything, and narrow-mindedness and sectarianism that exclude others are all harmful to our cause.

    The great leap forward in prevention and control work this year and the great leap forward in agricultural production have come together. This is the harvest of adhering to the principle that prevention and control work must be closely integrated with production. Some people have exaggerated the contradiction between prevention and control work and production. They said that if you focus on production, you cannot focus on blood prevention; if you focus on blood prevention, you cannot focus on production. This is a wrong argument. First, they did not see that prevention and control work and production have a unified side. Under the situation of the great leap forward this year, a labor shortage has appeared in rural areas. Precisely because of this, the masses' demands for eliminating schistosomiasis earlier are even more urgent. The combination of prevention and control work and production has not weakened but strengthened. Everyone knows that schistosomiasis seriously destroys labor. In severe cases, it is bedridden, and in mild cases, it is "a hoe weighs two pounds of iron, and you want to rest when you get it in your hand." It is obvious that in areas where this disease is prevalent, the masses must demand that prevention and control work be carried out at the same time as the great leap forward in agricultural production. On the one hand, they protect labor from schistosomiasis infection, and on the other hand, they rescue the infected labor to restore health. Only in this way can the great leap forward in agricultural production be guaranteed. Second, they did not see the contradiction between prevention and control and production. As long as we adhere to the principle of carrying out prevention and control work with production as the center, it can be resolved satisfactorily. This year, various places have created many good experiences in prevention and control and production, double-attack, and two-promotion in snail eradication and treatment. The method of three sounds with one shot (one shot is water extraction, and three sounds are water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and snail eradication) created in the water network area of ​​Jiangnan has been warmly welcomed by the masses. The masses said: "If you want a thousand catties of grain per mu, you need a lot of fertilizer and water and strong labor. Fight hard day and night to eliminate snails, control water, accumulate fertilizer, and make your body strong." How willing the masses are to unify prevention and control work with production.

    The great victory of the basic elimination of schistosomiasis in Fujian Province and Shanghai City has played a role in spurring our entire army of prevention and control workers to make another leap forward. Since two provinces and cities that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis have already emerged, can't other provinces create the same miracle and greater miracles? There are still three months of valuable time this year. Party committees at all levels should continue to adhere to the leadership methods of the secretary taking command, personally taking action, and fully mobilizing the masses, and complete and over fulfill this year's tasks in one go while the iron is hot. All places that are about to basically eliminate schistosomiasis must ensure quality and quantity and strictly meet the three requirements for the basic elimination of schistosomiasis stipulated by the central government. Those that are unqualified must make up lessons. As everyone knows, snail eradication must go through repeated struggles several times in a short period of time so that snails have no chance to survive. Patients must also undergo repeated treatment to be cured. Places that have not yet achieved the basic elimination of schistosomiasis should combine the good opportunities of large-scale water conservancy, land leveling, and biogasification this winter to carry out various prevention and control work. Places that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis should also take advantage of the victory to advance and strive for the complete elimination of schistosomiasis. In short, we cannot be hasty and cannot relax. Haste means failure; relaxation means there is a danger of abandoning all previous efforts!

    Let us congratulate Fujian Province and Shanghai City on the great victory of the basic elimination of schistosomiasis. This great victory marks another leap forward in the struggle of our people to eliminate schistosomiasis. With two provinces and cities that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis, there will be more provinces that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis! We want to repeat a sentence: Looking at the development trend of the overall situation, the day when schistosomiasis will be completely eliminated nationwide is not too far away. The realization of this grand vision requires us to pay more great wisdom and labor. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, our country will surely become the first country in the world to completely eliminate schistosomiasis!

### 祝贺一省一市基本消灭血吸虫病

    祝贺一省一市基本消灭血吸虫病
    事情的发展真像滚滚而来的长江大河一样地一浪高过一浪。我国人民在党的领导之下，从1956年开始了大规模围剿血吸虫病的战斗。那时有许多人还在争论我国能不能消灭血吸虫病的问题，但这一年已出现了六个基本消灭钉螺的乡、镇。在1957年不仅出现基本消灭血吸虫病的乡、镇，而且出现了十五个基本消灭血吸虫病的县。今年只经过了九个月，防治血吸虫病工作却出现了前所未有的大跃进局面。现在不但增加九十六个新的基本消灭血吸虫病的县，而且出现了福建省和上海市两个基本消灭血吸虫病的省市。这两个省市是今年卫生工作放出的两个向国庆献礼的“卫星”。看来在全国范围内彻底消灭血吸虫病的日子，为期也不太远了。
    这几年来在防治工作中一直存在着两条路线的斗争。我们的党从我国的实际出发，提出了积极防治的方针和综合措施。它的基本精神是既要防，又要治，防与治必须采取综合措施。这正是一条多快好省地消灭血吸虫病的路线但是，有一些崇拜资产阶级医药权威的人，提出了一条和党相对抗的路线，这就是“以预防为主，预防又以灭螺为主，灭螺又以药物灭螺为主”。它的基本精神是只要防，不要治，而防又只是灭螺，灭螺也只是药物一种措施。这是一条少慢差费的路线。当这条少慢差费的路线受到党的拒绝的时候，他们竟狂妄地攻击党是外行，不能领导科学。究竟是谁正确呢？我们且看事实吧。原上海县在一个主张以灭螺为主的专家指导下，几年来单纯依靠药物灭螺，但是一直没有达到基本消灭钉螺的标准。今年上海县拔掉资产阶级的白旗，插上无产阶级的红旗，放手发动群众，采用多种灭螺的方法，包括土埋、铲草、药物、火烧及捕捉等项方法，实践证明其中以土埋灭螺的效力最大，其他各项只是辅助性方法。这样就在五个月之内，实现基本灭螺标准，而且由于领导满足群众抢救劳动力的迫切要求，抓紧治疗工作，群众与血吸虫病作斗争的劲头更大了。这个县终于一跃而为基本消灭血吸虫病的县。事实胜于雄辩，谁的路线是多快好省，谁的路线是少慢差费，从这个例子中不是可以对比出来么？
    今年防治工作大跃进，又是一场破除资产阶级医药权威，树立无产阶级卫生工作的一场艰巨的斗争。有一些人迷信外国，崇拜洋人，在防治工作中常常长他人威风、灭自己志气。你去请教他如何灭螺，他的回答是：“钉螺是一种自然生物，彻底消灭是不可能的，有的国家医药发达，流行地区又小，他们搞了五十年，还用水泥筑河道，尚且不能消灭，何况我们？”你把长程疗法加以革新，由二十天缩短为三天，由三天缩短为二天，他又要泼冷水了，“外国今天仍然是四十天疗法，我们的二十天疗法已经很进步，再缩短太冒险了。”总之，在他们看来，凡是外国人没有做到的
  事，中国人也一定做不到。这是一种极端有害的悲观论调。为什么这些人老是长洋人的威风，灭自己的志气呢？为什么对于抢救千万劳动者生命的事情无动于衷呢？原因有二。一是不相信社会主义制度的优越性，不相信我国人民在党的领导之下完全有力量和一切危害人类的疾病作斗争，二是不懂得社会主义的国家和资本主义国家不同，资本主义国家对劳动者的生命是不重视的，而我们却断然不能容忍血吸虫病继续危害劳动者生命。他们的那种长洋人威风的论调，经不起防治工作大跃进的事实一驳。请看他们和时代距离多么远。例如：上海流行地区有六百零二平方公里，病人有十一万，在二年多时间内就基本消灭血吸虫病；有的资本主义国家流行地区面积比上海小，人数比上海少，费了四、五十年时间还没有解决。由此可见，资产阶级医药权威实在没有什么权威可言，无产阶级卫生工作的气势真正伟大！今年防治工作大跃进深刻地表明：我国人民不仅有力量消灭血吸虫病，完成世界上各流行国家所不能做到的事，而且可以用大跃进的高速度完成这件事。
    大闹群众运动是今年防治工作大跃进的关键。有些人反对这样做，其理由无非是“群众不懂科学技术”，“又是劳民伤财”。我们认为防治工作必须大闹群众运动。闹得越大，集中群众的智慧和力量越多，血吸虫病就可以消灭得越快。由于大闹群众运动，今年防治工作中的技术革新、创造发明像雨后春笋一样涌现出来，在治疗方面最有价值的是湖南省青年医士刘锦桃和黄维恒创造的治疗高工效，并在治疗高工效运动中制成几种新的医疗器具，在未创造高工效以前，一个小组每月收治病人最高纪录是一百五十人，现在跃进到每月六千人，翻了四十倍，一点也没有“劳民伤财”。科学技术对于思想解放的青年人来说，也并不那末“高不可攀”。劳动人民在消灭血吸虫病斗争中，因时因地制宜，创造了许多土办法。土办法并不错，有的甚至超过洋办法。大面积车水、三面光土埋钉螺，这是国际文献上从未有过的，然而它确实比药物灭螺的洋办法效力大。我们并不反对洋办法，我们是主张土洋并举的。大医院固然也需要，但是杯水车薪无济于事，因此，农民用毛竹和茅草搭的临时医院，用门板搭成的病床，也不可少。中西医并举也是我们的主张。有人曾经睹咒：“中医要能把血吸虫病治好，我把头杀给他”。但是，事实证明中医治疗晚期病人确有独到之处。大家知道，防治工作是关系到一亿人民安全的大事情，只有调动一切积极因素，发扬群众的一切创造性，我们才能把这件大事情做得又快又好。脱离群众、包办代替的作风和胸襟狭隘、排斥他人的宗派情绪，对我们事业来说，都是有百害而无一利的。
    今年防治工作大跃进和农业生产大跃进是一同到来的，这是坚持防治工作必须与生产密切结合的收获。曾经有一些人夸大了防治工作与生产的矛盾。他们说抓生产就不能抓血防；抓血防就不能抓生产。这是一种错误的论调，第一，他们没有看到防治工作和生产有统一的一面。在今年大跃进形势之下，农村出现了劳动力紧张的局面。正因这样，群众对于提早消灭血吸虫病的要求更加迫切。防治工作与生产的结合不是削弱而是加强了。谁都知道，血吸虫病是严重破坏劳动力的，重则缠绵床褥，轻则是“一把锄头两斤铁，拿到手中就想歇”。显而易见，流行这种疾病地区，群众一定要求在农业生产大跃进的同时，展开防治工作，一方面保护劳动力不受血吸虫病感染，另一方面抢救已感染的劳动力恢复健康，这才能使农业生产大跃进得到保障。第二，他们没有看到防治和生产的矛盾，只要坚持以生产为中心来展开防治工作，是可以得到圆满地解决的。今年各地在灭螺、治疗等方面创造了许多防治、生产双突击、两促进的好经验。江南水网地区创造的一炮三响的方法（一炮是车水，三响是水利、积肥、灭螺），受到群众的热烈欢迎。群众说：“要想亩产千斤粮，肥多水足劳动力强，日夜苦战灭钉螺，治水积肥身体壮”。群众是多末愿意把防治工作同生产统一起来呵。
    福建省和上海市基本消灭血吸虫病的巨大胜利，起了鞭策我们全体防治工作大军再跃进的作用。既然已经出现了两个基本消灭血吸虫病的省市，难道旁的省不能创造同样的奇迹和更大的奇迹么？今年还有三个月的宝贵时间，各级党委应该继续坚持书记挂帅、亲自动手、充分发动群众的领导方法，趁热打铁，一气呵成地完成和超额完成今年的全部任务。凡是快要基本消灭血吸虫病的地方，必须切实做到保质保量，严格符合中央规定的基本消灭血吸虫病的三点要求，不合格的必须补课。大家知道，灭螺必须经过短期之内连续数次反复的斗争，才能使钉螺无苟延喘息的机会，病人也要经过反复治疗，才能得到根治。尚未达到基本消灭血吸虫病的地方，应该结合今冬大兴水利、平整土地、沼气化的良机，进行各项防治工作。已经基本消灭血吸虫病的地方，也要乘胜前进，向彻底消灭血吸虫病努力。总之，不能草率，不能松气。草率就是失败；松气就有前功尽弃的危险！
    让我们祝贺福建省和上海市基本消灭血吸虫病的巨大胜利吧。这个巨大的胜利标志着我国人民消灭血吸虫病斗争的再跃进。有了两个基本消灭血吸虫病的省市，就会有更多个基本消灭血吸虫病的省！我们要重复说一句：看大局发展的趋势，在全国范围内彻底消灭血吸虫病的日子，为期并不太远了。这个宏伟的远景的实现，需要我们付出更巨大的智慧和劳动。我们相信在党的领导下，我国一定能够成为世界上第一个彻底歼灭血吸虫病的国家！
