Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 8th. The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, in a statement on the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait, called on the Indonesian people to oppose any form of American interference and aggression against China.

The statement said that the Indonesian people fully support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and the Chinese coastal islands of Jinmen, Mazu, etc.

The statement was published in today's Jakarta "People's Daily".

The statement pointed out that the liberation of Taiwan and other coastal islands is China's internal affair. If the United States does not engage in military intervention, China will never cause international tension and international conflict when resolving this internal affair. The United States has long been using force to maintain the illegal status and rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, in order to make Taiwan a major American military base in Asia. The statement said that the United States' dispatch of its navy and air force to Taiwan, as well as the threats from senior American military and government officials, including the threat of using atomic and hydrogen bombs, are the root cause of the current tension in the Taiwan Strait.

The statement pointed out that the Taiwan Strait incident is a provocative activity within the scope of military provocations against China and other Asian countries planned by the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the United States for several years. The harassment and provocations carried out by the Chiang Kai-shek clique not only threaten China's security, but also hinder China's relations and trade with other countries in the world.

The statement further pointed out that the Chinese people's liberation of these islands is not only their patriotic responsibility, but also shows that this will eliminate the source of international tension and subversive activities, thereby further protecting the security of Asian countries.

The statement said that therefore, peace-loving countries and people sympathize with the Chinese side. The Indonesian people hope that all Chinese islands, especially Taiwan, should be liberated and returned to their legitimate owner, the People's Republic of China. If this is achieved – and it will certainly be achieved – it will not only be a victory for China and the Chinese people, but also a victory for all peace-loving countries and people in the world, especially the countries of Southeast Asia. These countries have always been the target of subversive activities by the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The statement said that Chairman Mao Zedong's convening of the Supreme State Conference shows that the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan and other Chinese islands is unwavering. The statement expressed support for China's decision on its territorial waters. The statement pointed out that this decision was made to safeguard national sovereignty and to more effectively resist foreign interference.

　　印度尼西亚共产党号召人民
    支持中国人民解放自己领土
    新华社雅加达8日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局在就台湾海峡紧张局势发表的声明中，号召印度尼西亚人民反对美国对中国的任何形式的干涉和侵略。
    声明说，印度尼西亚人民完全支持中国人民解放台湾和金门、马祖等中国沿海岛屿的斗争。
    声明刊载在今天的雅加达“人民日报”上。
    声明指出，解放台湾和其他沿海岛屿是中国人民的内政问题。如果美国不进行军事干涉的话，中国在解决这个内政问题时绝不会引起国际紧张局势和国际冲突。美国长期来一直在用武力维持蒋介石集团在台湾的非法地位和统治，以便使台湾成为美国在亚洲的主要军事基地。声明说，美国派遣它的海军和空军去台湾，以及美国高级军事和政府官员的威胁，其中包括使用原子弹和氢弹的威胁，是目前台湾海峡紧张局势的根源。
    声明指出，台湾海峡事件是蒋介石集团几年以来在美国策划的反对中国和其他亚洲国家的军事挑衅范围内的挑衅活动。蒋介石集团所进行的骚扰和挑衅，不仅威胁着中国的安全，而且还妨碍中国和世界其他国家的关系和贸易往来。
    声明进一步指出，中国人民解放这些岛屿不仅是他们的爱国责任，而且也表明这会消除国际紧张局势和颠复活动的根源，从而进一步保护亚洲国家的安全。
    声明说，因此，爱好和平的国家和人民是同情中国方面的。印度尼西亚人民希望所有中国的岛屿，尤其是台湾；应该得到解放，并且归还给它们的合法的所有者中华人民共和国。如果实现这一点——一定会实现的——这不仅是中国和中国人民的胜利，而且也是全世界所有爱好和平国家和人民的胜利，首先是东南亚国家的胜利。这些国家一向是蒋介石集团进行颠复活动的目标。
    声明说，毛泽东主席召开最高国务会议表明，中国人民解放台湾和中国的其他岛屿的决心是不可动摇的。声明表示支持中国对它的领海所作出的决定。声明指出，作出这一决定是为了维护国家的主权，并且是为了更有效地抵抗外国干涉。
