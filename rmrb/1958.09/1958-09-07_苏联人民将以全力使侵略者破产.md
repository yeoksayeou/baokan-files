The "Soviet Russia" points out that if the American robbers dare to lay a finger on the People's China, they may lose not only their hands, but also their heads.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 5th: Today, the Soviet newspapers "Izvestia," "Trud," "Red Star," and "Soviet Russia" continued to denounce the provocative actions of American imperialism in the Far East.

The commentary in "Izvestia" stated that the American ruling circles should not forget that the People's Republic of China is not alone; it is a part of the powerful socialist camp. The joy and sorrow of the Chinese people are the joy and sorrow of the people of all socialist countries. China has allies like the Soviet Union, which will provide all assistance when necessary.

"Trud" published a commentary with the large headline "The People Demand an End to American Provocations in the Far East," stating that American provocations against China have aroused the anger of the entire Soviet people.

The commentary in "Red Star" stated that the Soviet people fully support the just struggle of their ally and friend, the Chinese people. No one has the right to prevent the Chinese people from realizing their legitimate aspirations, liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands, and completing the unification of their motherland. The American occupiers should immediately get out of other people's land, stop polluting the waters of the Taiwan Strait, and stop threatening China, because such threats will not intimidate anyone.

The commentary in "Soviet Russia" stated that if the imperialist robbers dare to lay a finger on the People's China, they may lose not only their hands, but also their heads.

This newspaper, Moscow, September 6th: The American imperialists' blatant interference in China's internal affairs, armed aggression against China's coastal territories, and behavior that threatens China, Asia, and world peace have aroused great indignation among the Soviet people. In recent days, they have published articles in Moscow newspapers or written letters to the newspaper editors, unanimously condemning the imperialists' new war provocation plot and resolutely supporting the Chinese people's liberation of the coastal territories of Taiwan, Kinmen, and Matsu.

Today, the "Pravda," "Trud," "Soviet Russia," "Komsomolskaya Pravda," and other newspapers published letters from workers, peasants, and scholars from all over the Soviet Union. The lathe operator Sulirin from the Moscow Red Proletarian Factory said that the Soviet people, like the progressive people all over the world, resolutely condemn American imperialism for creating new tensions in the Far East. We, the Soviet people, fully support the Chinese people's legitimate recovery of their coastal territories. No provocative act can intimidate the Chinese people. The Chinese people will certainly be able to give a firm rebuff to any act of aggression. Ivanxia, the chairman of the Katselovichi Village Farm in the Derbezynsky District of the Kiev Region, said: We Soviet collective farm members are extremely angry about American imperialism's provocations against China. We love and respect the Chinese people and are sincerely happy for their achievements in peaceful construction. We are convinced that the Chinese people will be able to give the aggressors a head-on blow. Professor and President Bagrochitsky of the Leningrad Electromechanical Institute said: Let those aggressors who have crossed the oceans know that we, the Soviet people, will never allow our brotherly Chinese people to suffer misfortune. We will spare no effort to completely bankrupt the aggressors.

The lathe operator and Stalin Prize winner Fosuiev from the Moscow Likhachev Automobile Factory said: We firmly oppose the new military adventures of the United States in the Taiwan region. We will never allow American imperialism to disrupt the peaceful life of 600 million Chinese people. Whoever aggresses against China is also aggressing against the Soviet Union and the entire powerful socialist camp.

The letter from the workers Karshinov, Gudarov, and Yegorov from the Far East Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Factory in Boli, Heilongjiang, stated: We, the people of Boli, are close relatives of the Chinese people. When we learned about American imperialism's aggression against China, more than 4,000 workers in our factory unanimously said, "Chinese friends, we are with you forever, and we will go to you to help you whenever you need us." Now we support you with practical actions, and we are determined to strive to complete your order of 300 diesel engines by the end of this year.

    莫斯科李哈乔夫汽车厂旋工、斯大林奖金获得者福苏耶夫说：我们坚决反对美国在台湾地区进行新的军事冒险，我们任何时候都不允许美帝国主义破坏六亿中国人民的和平生活。谁要是侵略中国，这也就是侵略苏联和整个强大的社会主义阵营。
