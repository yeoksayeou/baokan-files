To achieve fast transportation, fast loading and unloading, and absolutely no backlog of steel and iron materials, Sichuan Province is establishing a steel transportation line.

(Our newspaper, Chengdu, 1st dispatch) Sichuan Province is mobilizing all its forces to accelerate transportation work, acting as a "pioneer" and "paving the way" for steel production, ensuring the "marshal" takes command.

The province's trains, automobiles, ships, wooden boats, and various forms of civilian transport, as well as dock loading and unloading and other transportation forces, have recently adopted effective measures to improve transportation efficiency, transporting iron as soon as it's available, and guaranteeing that materials supporting steel production will not be backlogged. Each special district and some counties in the province have recently established steel transportation offices or transportation command centers to unify planning and comprehensively arrange transportation work to ensure the production of steel.

Currently, more than one million people in mountainous and plain areas across the province are rushing to repair various roads, accelerating the transportation of coal, iron, and other materials. By the end of the year, the province will complete 10,000 kilometers of simple roads, of which 3,933 kilometers have already been built. The secretary of the Da County Special District is taking the lead, organizing more than 100 automobiles, more than 1,000 wooden boats, and tens of thousands of laborers to transport pig iron to Chongqing day and night by land and water. More than 10,000 tons of pig iron originally backlogged in the special district has been shipped out in a steady stream. In order to transport the iron to Chongqing for steelmaking as soon as possible, the Luzhou Special District organized more than 100,000 people to transport it day and night, using all means of transportation. Currently, the special district has transported 2,000 tons of iron to Chongqing, and there are more than 14,000 tons of iron concentrated at stations and docks, ready to be transported to Chongqing within days.

Highway transportation departments are adopting methods such as running double shifts and using automobile trains to guarantee steel transportation day and night. In order to meet the requirements of automobile trains, various localities are vigorously manufacturing trailers. By the end of the year, the province will manufacture 4,320 trailers. Units that have already implemented automobile trains have improved transportation efficiency by more than 80%. All localities are making every effort to rush the transportation of materials supporting steel production. A batch of timber from the Li County forest area supporting the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company was organized into a motorcade running double shifts, and was rushed to completion in one month. The iron ore from the Daofu Iron Mine supporting the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company is also being transported eastward along the Kangzang Highway. Recently, the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company supported various special districts with more than 4,000 tons of steel, which was rushed to completion within three days.

The wooden boat transportation departments of the Jialing River, Min River, Qingyi River, Tuo River and other rivers are also taking various measures to transport "grain" for the steel industry more and faster. Nanchong, Luzhou and other places have widely adopted the method of towing wooden boats to double the efficiency of transportation. The waterway between Chongqing and Nanchong on the Jialing River is being renovated and dredged to expand transportation capacity. Steamship transportation is also promoting advanced experiences, further tapping the potential of motor traction, increasing tug barges, and implementing night navigation to increase the volume of transport.

The new tasks brought by supporting steel production to transportation work also promote the need for loading and unloading work to keep up. At present, larger docks such as Chaozimen, Maoertuo, Yibin, and Leshan in Chongqing have achieved mechanization or semi-mechanization. Sometimes, when the ship arrives at the dock, the boatmen load and unload the cargo themselves before the porters arrive. Recently, manpower is being organized along the railway lines throughout the province to haul away more than 100,000 tons of materials supporting steel production currently piled up at the stations within two weeks.

### 快运输　快装卸　决不积压出钢出铁的物资  四川建立钢铁运输线

    快运输　快装卸　决不积压出钢出铁的物资
　　四川建立钢铁运输线
    本报成都1日电　四川省调动一切力量，促使交通运输工作快马加鞭，当好“先行官”，为钢铁生产“开路搭桥”，保证“元帅”升帐。
    全省的火车、汽车、轮船、木船以及各种民间运输工具，码头装卸等各种运输力量，最近都采取有效措施，提高运输效率，见铁就运，凡是支援钢铁生产的物资保证不积压。全省各个专区和部分县，最近成立了钢铁运输办公室或运输指挥部，统一计划，全面安排，力争做好钢铁生产的运输工作。
    目前，全省山区和平原，约有一百多万人正在赶修各种道路，加快煤、铁等物资的运输。到年底，全省要修好一万公里的简易公路，现在已经修起的简易公路就有三千九百三十三公里。达县专区书记挂帅，组织了一百多辆汽车，一千多只木船和上万民工，水陆两路，日夜向重庆赶运生铁。全专区原来积压的一万多吨生铁，已经源源运出。为了把铁尽快调运到重庆炼钢，泸州专区组织了十多万人，利用一切运输工具，日夜赶运。目前，全专区运到重庆的铁已有二千吨，集中到车站、码头，日内即可运往重庆的铁还有一万四千多吨。
    公路运输部门采用开双班、汽车列车化等办法，日夜兼程，保证钢铁运输。为了满足汽车列车化的要求，各地正在大力制造拖车，到年底全省要制造拖车四千三百二十部。已经实现汽车列车化的单位，运输效率提高80％以上。凡是支援钢铁生产的物资各地都尽全力抢运。理县森林区支援重庆钢铁公司的一批木材，组织车队开双班，一个月就抢运完毕。道孚铁矿支援重庆钢铁公司的铁矿石，也沿着康藏公路，兼程东运。最近，重庆钢铁公司支援各个专区的四千多吨钢材，三天内便抢运完毕。
    嘉陵江、岷江、青衣江、沱江等河流的木船运输部门，也采取各种措施，又多又快地为钢铁工业运“粮”。南充、泸州等地普遍采用了木船拖带的方法，提高运效一倍。嘉陵江重庆、南充间的航道，正在整治、疏浚，扩大运输能力。轮船运输也正在推广先进经验，进一步发挥马达牵引潜力，增加拖驳，实行夜航，使运量加番。
    支援钢铁生产给交通运输工作带来的新任务，也促进装卸工作必须跟上去。现在，重庆的朝子门、猫儿沱、宜宾、乐山等较大的码头，已经实现了机械化或半机械化。有时，船到码头，不等搬运工人到来，船工就自己装卸。最近，全省铁路沿线正在组织人力，将现在堆放车站的十多万吨支援钢铁生产的物资，在两星期内拖运完毕。　　（李德森）
