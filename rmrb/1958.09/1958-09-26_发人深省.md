    Thought-Provoking

    The article "The Conflict Between Indigenous and Foreign Methods in the Experimental Field," published in the People's Daily on August 28, is a good article. After reading it, one deeply feels the necessity of breaking down superstition and liberating thought.

    The paddy field experimental plot of the East China Agricultural Science Institute possesses the best material and technical conditions in the country. In principle, the yield should be very high. However, the reality is not like this. Not only is it far behind the agricultural cooperatives that released high-yield "satellites," it is also lagging behind the local agricultural cooperatives. Isn't this a thought-provoking matter?

    This article sounds an alarm for intellectuals who blindly believe in book knowledge: If intellectuals want to make their knowledge truly useful for socialist construction, they must put down their airs, go to the masses, and humbly learn from the working people. This is the broad road. Otherwise, their knowledge will not be effective, and they will only have the empty name of "expert."

    发人深省
    8月28日人民日报发表的“试验田里的土洋之争”是一篇好文章，看完以后使人深深感到打破迷信、解放思想的必要。
    华东农业科学研究所搞的水稻试验田，拥有全国第一流的物质条件和技术条件。照理说，产量应该是很高的。然而，事实并不是这样，不但远远比不上放出高产“卫星”的农业社，就是和本地的农业社比较也是落后了。这难道不是一桩发人深省的事情吗？
    这篇文章向迷信书本的知识分子们敲响了警钟：知识分子如果要使自己的知识对社会主义建设真正有用，就必须放下架子，到群众中去，虚心向劳动人民学习，这才是一条康庄的大道。否则他们的知识将不起作用，徒有“专家”的虚名而已。
