Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th: Former U.S. President Truman admitted in a speech in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on the 17th that the Soviet Union is rapidly catching up with the United States economically. He said, "The Russians are catching up with us, not only because they are moving forward, but also because we are moving backward."

Truman cited the steel industry as an example, saying, "For most of this year, the U.S. steel industry's equipment utilization rate has only reached a little more than 50%." However, he blamed the current periodic economic crisis of capitalist production in the United States solely on the incompetence of the Republican government.

Prior to this, a report released by a U.S. industrial delegation after an invited visit to the Soviet Union also acknowledged the rapid progress made by the Soviet steel industry. The report stated that the Soviet steel industry has abundant raw material resources, ambitious expansion plans, and prioritized infrastructure investment, so it will continue to develop rapidly in the future.

    杜鲁门也不得不承认
    苏联经济正迅速赶上美国
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国前总统杜鲁门17日在新泽西州的大西洋城发表演讲时承认，苏联在经济上正迅速赶上美国。他说，“俄国人正在赶上我们，这不仅因为他们正在不断前进，而且也因为我们正在倒退”。
    杜鲁门举钢铁工业为例说，“在今年的绝大部分时间里，美国钢铁工业的设备利用率只达到比50％稍多一点。”但是他把美国目前的资本主义生产的周期性经济危机仅仅归罪于共和党政府的无能。
    在这以前，在一个应邀访问苏联的美国工业界代表团回国后发表的报告中也承认苏联钢铁工业生产已经取得迅速进展。报告说，苏联钢铁工业拥有丰富的原料资源、雄心勃勃的扩展计划和优先的基本建设投资，因此它今后还将继续不断迅速发展。
