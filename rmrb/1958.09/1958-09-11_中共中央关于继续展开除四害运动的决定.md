The elimination of the four pests, promotion of hygiene, and eradication of diseases are fundamental and important measures to enhance the people's health, protect the labor force, and improve labor efficiency. In order to ensure the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the Patriotic Health Campaign (eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene) should also make a great leap forward. This is exactly what is happening. In the past year, the national industrial and agricultural production has developed by leaps and bounds. Rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, and flies, the four pests, have been basically eliminated in many places. Paying attention to hygiene has become a habit for the vast majority of people in many areas. The incidence of many of the most harmful diseases has also been greatly reduced. In particular, the prevention and control of schistosomiasis has achieved significant results. The elimination of the four pests and promotion of hygiene has indeed demonstrated the great role of "changing customs and transforming the country."

However, rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes are living things, and they breed quickly. If you eliminate them today, but relax your efforts, they will reproduce again after a while. The same is true for schistosomiasis and other infectious disease vectors. Therefore, the elimination of the four pests and promotion of hygiene should be a regular task and should not be relaxed throughout the year. At the same time, on the basis of continuous efforts, there should be several concentrated campaigns each year, such as during the New Year, Spring Festival, May Day, National Day, etc., several times a year. Only in this way, with regular work and surprise attacks, persisting unremittingly, can we finally eliminate the four pests completely. The prevention and control of schistosomiasis should also be carefully inspected and evaluated several times a year. Other serious diseases should also be planned, actively prevented and controlled, reducing the incidence, and ultimately achieving basic freedom from the harm of these diseases.

National Day is approaching. Before National Day, all localities are required to universally launch a large-scale Patriotic Health Campaign (eliminating the four pests). This is the busy season of autumn harvest, but as long as it is properly arranged, it is still possible to concentrate one or two days for a major effort. Eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, clean up, and greet the National Day. Moreover, from now on, this work should be persisted in regularly, consolidating the existing "four-free villages" and "four-free counties," creating more "four-free villages," "four-free counties," and "four-free provinces," so that our country becomes a country without rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes, basically eliminating the harm of infectious diseases, where everyone is healthy and strong, to promote a greater leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production.

### 中共中央关于继续展开除四害运动的决定

    中共中央关于继续展开除四害运动的决定
    一九五八年八月二十九日
    除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病，是增强人民体质、保护劳动力、提高劳动效率的一项带根本性的重要措施。为了保障工农业生产大跃进，除四害、讲卫生运动也应该大跃进。实际情况也正是这样。将近一年来，全国的工农业生产有了飞跃的发展，老鼠、麻雀、蚊子、苍蝇这四害在许多地方已经基本消灭，讲卫生在许多地方已经成为广大人民的习惯，许多危害最严重的疾病的发病率也大大减低了；特别是血吸虫病的防治工作，已经有了很显著的成效。除四害、讲卫生，确实表现出“移风易俗、改造国家”的伟大作用。
    但是，老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子是活东西，孽生很快，今天打得看不见了，稍一放松，过一个时候，它又繁殖起来了。血吸虫和其它许多传染病的媒介虫，也都是如此。因此，除四害、讲卫生应该成为经常性的工作，一年到头，都不能放松。同时，在经常努力的基础上，一年又要搞几次突击，例如，过年、春节、五一节、国庆节等等，一年突击几次。只有这样，经常工作和突击运动，坚持不懈地搞下去，才能最后把四害消灭干净。血吸虫病的防治工作，一年也要认真检查评比几次。其他危害严重的疾病，也要定出规划，积极进行防治，减少发病率，最后达到基本免除这些疾病的危害。
    国庆节快到了，在国庆节以前，要求各地普遍举行一次大规模的除四害运动。这个时候，正是秋收的农忙季节，但是，只要安排得当，集中一两天的时间，大搞一下，还是可以的。除四害，讲卫生，打扫得干干净净，迎接国庆。并且，从此把这一工作经常地坚持下去，使已有的“四无乡”、“四无县”巩固起来，创造出更多的“四无乡”、“四无县”、“四无省”，使我们的国家成为一个没有老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子、基本消灭传染病的危害的国家，人人体格健康，个个身强力壮，以促进我国工农业生产更大地跃进。
