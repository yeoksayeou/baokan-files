　　Great Revolution in Architectural Design
　　Movable Type Design Replaces Drafting, Increasing Efficiency Thirty Times
    (Our dispatch) The design personnel of the Rubber Design Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry have created a "prefabricated movable type design method" to replace manual drafting, increasing design efficiency by more than thirty times, and guaranteeing 100% accuracy of drawings. This reform in architectural design is of great significance for reversing the situation of "design not keeping up with construction" and "poor drawing quality."
    China's design departments have always used a handicraft production method for design, resulting in low labor efficiency and slow design speed, which is not adapted to the rapidly developing situation of socialist construction. The design personnel of the Rubber Design Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry had also adopted rapid design methods such as standard design, repeated use of drawings, and cut-and-paste drawings, but they still could not meet the needs of construction. In order to reverse this situation, engineer Zhong Chengzhi of the Civil Engineering and Construction Department came up with the idea of ​​using small blocks of pieced-together designs to speed up drawing production. With the help of all the young designers, the "prefabricated movable type design method" was created.
    The "prefabricated movable type design method" is based on the same principle as movable type printing. The designers first mark the dimensions of various specifications of beams, columns, windows, and roof panels on pieces of frosted glass of different sizes, and cut the frosted glass pieces into different shapes. When the construction unit commissions a design, the designers assemble the frosted glass pieces like building blocks according to the size of the factory building, and after re-exposure, they can be printed into drawings.
    This new design method has four major advantages: First, it liberates the productive forces. For a long time, designers have been confined to T-squares and triangles, and in each project, they have to repeatedly draw various drawings that have different forms but basically the same content. After adopting the "prefabricated movable type design method," the design work no longer needs to draw, as long as the fixed-format pictures are assembled according to needs, the required construction drawings can be obtained, freeing the designers from the heavy drafting work to engage in the research of design work standardization, so as to improve the design level. Second, it speeds up the design progress. In the past, it took one hundred and twenty workdays to design a rubber factory with an annual output of three thousand tons, but now it only takes four workdays to complete, increasing efficiency by thirty times. Third, the design quality is high. Because the drawn unit stereotype pictures are all carefully crafted and carefully reviewed, only attention needs to be paid to the connection of the joints during assembly to ensure the quality of the drawings. Fourth, it simplifies the design work. All technical problems in the design are solved on the stereotype pictures. In this way, anyone with general knowledge of civil engineering and construction can undertake design work.
    The application range of the "prefabricated movable type design method" is very wide, and it can be used in various brick-wood, reinforced concrete structure single-story and multi-story industrial buildings or civil buildings. At present, the Fifth Design Institute of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, the Paper Design Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry, the Railway Ministry Design Institute, and design departments in Wuhan, Nanjing and other places are promoting this advanced design method.

### 建筑设计大革命  活版设计代绘图  提高效率三十倍

　　建筑设计大革命
　　活版设计代绘图  提高效率三十倍
    本报讯　化工部橡胶设计院设计人员创造了“装配式的活版设计法”代替手工绘图法，使设计效率提高三十倍以上，图纸质量保证百分之百正确。这项建筑设计的改革，对于扭转“设计赶不上施工”、“图纸质量差”的局面有重大意义。
    我国的设计部门一直都是采用手工业生产方式进行设计的，劳动效率低，设计速度慢，和社会主义建设高速发展的形势不相适应。化工部橡胶设计院的设计人员也曾采取标准设计、重复利用图纸、剪贴图纸等快速设计法，但还是不能满足施工的需要。为了扭转这个局面，土木建筑科钟承志工程师想出用小块拼凑的设计方法来加速出图，经过全体青年设计人员的帮助，创造了“装配式活版设计法”。
    “装配式活版设计法”和铅印活字排版的原理一样。设计人员先把各种规格的大梁、柱子、窗户、屋面板的尺寸，划在大小不一的毛玻璃上，把毛玻璃片划成不同的形状，当建设单位委托设计时，设计人员根据厂房大小，把毛玻璃片像搭积木一样拼排起来，经过复晒就能晒成图纸。
    这种新的设计方法有四大优点：一、解放了生产力。长期以来设计人员总是被束缚在丁字尺、三角板下面，而在每一工程中要重复地画一些形式不同而基本内容总是一致的各种图纸。采用了“装配式活版设计法”后，设计工作可以不必再画图，只要把定型图片按照需要进行拼排，即可得到所需要的施工图纸，使设计人员从繁重的制图工作中解放出来，去从事设计工作定型化的研究，以提高设计水平。二、加快了设计进度，过去设计一个年产三千吨的橡胶厂，需要一百二十个工日，现在只要四个工日就能完成，提高效率三十倍。三、设计质量高。由于所绘制的单元定型图片，都是经过精工细作和慎重审核的，在拼排时只须注意接头的衔接，就能保证图纸的质量。四、使设计工作更简单化了。设计中所有的技术问题，在定型图片上都解决了。这样，只要具有土木建筑常识的人员，都可承担设计工作。
    “装配式活版设计法”的应用范围非常广，各种砖木、钢筋混凝土结构的单层和多层工业建筑或民用建筑中都可采用。目前，第一机械工业部第五设计院、轻工业部造纸设计院、铁道部计院设和武汉、南京等地的设计部门都推广这种先进的设计方法。
