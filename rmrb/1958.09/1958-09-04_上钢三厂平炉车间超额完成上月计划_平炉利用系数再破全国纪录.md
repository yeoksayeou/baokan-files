Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd. The open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant achieved a utilization rate of 14.227 tons in August (steel production per square meter of hearth bottom per day and night), exceeding the 12.487 tons in July by 1.74 tons, once again setting a new national record for open hearth utilization rate. This workshop has exceeded its August leap forward target of 8,800 tons of steel production by twenty tons.

In the first half of August, the workshop's plan completion was not very good, lagging behind by more than 300 tons of output. On the 15th, after the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the call for "Leap Forward Again," the workshop was in full swing. The workers repeatedly studied and discussed the experience of the converter workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, adopted effective measures such as strengthening thermal maintenance, shortening smelting time, and stabilizing furnace output. The steelmaking time was quickly shortened from more than four hours per furnace to about three hours and forty minutes. The No. 2 furnace even created a new record of smelting one furnace of steel in two hours and fifty-three minutes. On the last day of the decisive battle to complete the August plan on the 31st, due to continuous heavy rain, the tide of the Huangpu River flooded the hearth bottom checker chamber, seriously affecting the furnace temperature and prolonging the smelting time, which brought great difficulties to production. However, under the concerted efforts and mutual support of the three shifts of workers in the workshop, measures were taken to increase air and gas blowing, racing against time, and finally reached a record of twelve furnaces in one day, completing the August leap forward target.

### 上钢三厂平炉车间超额完成上月计划  平炉利用系数再破全国纪录

　　上钢三厂平炉车间超额完成上月计划
　　平炉利用系数再破全国纪录
    新华社上海2日电　上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间8月份平炉的利用系数（每平方公尺炉底一昼夜的产钢量）达到一四点二二七吨，比7月份的一二点四八七吨超过一点七四吨，又一次创造了全国平炉利用系数的最新纪录。这个车间已经超额二十吨完成了8月份产钢八千八百吨的跃进指标。
    8月上半月，这个车间计划的完成情况不太好，拉下了三百多吨产量。15日，中共上海市委发出“跃进再跃进”的号召后，这个车间沸腾起来了。职工们反复学习和讨论了上海第一钢铁厂转炉车间的经验，采取了加强热工维护、缩短冶炼时间、稳定炉产量等有效措施，炼钢时间很快地从原来四个多小时一炉缩短到三小时四十分左右；二号炉还创造了一次二小时五十三分炼一炉钢的新纪录。到31日完成8月份计划决战的最后一天，由于连日大雨，黄浦江潮水侵及炉底格子房，严重影响炉温，使冶炼时间延长，给生产带来了很大困难。但是，在车间三班工人同心协作、相互支援配合操作下，采取加大空气、煤气吹炼的措施，分秒必争，终于在一天内达到了十二炉的纪录，完成了8月份跃进指标。
