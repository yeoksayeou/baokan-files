The Party Central Committee's educational policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor" has further inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses of young students and young teachers to continuously accomplish things that predecessors dared not imagine or do. For example, the teachers, students, and staff of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, through a hundred days and nights of hard work, manufactured a light passenger plane. Isn't this a miracle? Isn't this something that predecessors had never thought of doing? To build an airplane in just a hundred days and nights, its speed and efficiency are probably unprecedented both in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Isn't this sufficient proof of the greatness of the Party's General Line and the correctness of its educational policy? Doesn't this prove that Chairman Mao's instruction to "eliminate superstitions and liberate thought" has a huge driving force?

However, there are always those who hold back progress and those who merely observe the tide. Some people even doubt and oppose these wise decisions of the Central Committee, and especially resist the policy of combining education with productive labor. They believe that the school is just a place for studying, and students should study hard. The teacher lectures, the students listen; the teacher sets the questions, the students answer them; this has been the natural order of things since ancient times. As for labor, that is the business of the common people. How can dignified university professors and refined college students go down to the factory with greasy hands and dirty faces to work? It would be a loss of status and a waste of time. Besides, if they really participate in production, they cannot endure hardship and do not know how to do it. Why not shut themselves up in their rooms copying books and memorizing dogmas, and when they are satisfied, write a few papers and deliver a few grand theories, becoming famous throughout the world and filling their pockets with wealth? Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone? Therefore, driven by fame and profit, bourgeois individualism runs rampant. Thus, they greatly oppose the Party Central Committee's communist educational policy of combining education with productive labor. But these people dare not show their true colors, dare not say that they are afraid of hardship, are incompetent, and seek fame and profit. They have to pretend that the school's engagement in production hinders teaching and that students' participation in production affects the quality of their studies. Professors are not engineers and cannot teach students practical operations.

But what is the actual situation? The participation of students from the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in the production of aircraft and other various flying vehicles completely proves the absurdity of the above arguments. Students' participation in production not only did not reduce the quality of their studies, but also allowed them to learn real skills. They not only learned practical design knowledge and operational techniques for manufacturing physical objects through the production of aircraft and various other products, but also learned things that cannot be learned from books. This is much better than just drawing a three-view drawing of an aircraft at graduation and casually imagining a type of aircraft, engaging in armchair theorizing.

In addition, teachers who directly participate in production gain a lot of knowledge, which improves their theoretical and scientific and technological levels, thereby improving the quality of their future teaching. Not only that, but through participating in productive labor, they have also greatly transformed their thinking, raised their awareness, strengthened their labor viewpoints, and deepened their ideological feelings for the working class. Isn't this as different as heaven and earth from the bourgeois education that is divorced from reality and production?

Of course, there are also some teachers who think that the lectures and formulas they learned in the past can scare and captivate young students, and that they still have a market. But now, when they come into contact with reality, they make a great fool of themselves. In the laboratory, they don't know how to do experiments; in the production workshop, they dare not start the machine tools. But they still refuse to admit that they are incompetent, and instead sophistically say that they have not done it for many years and have become rusty. In fact, they have no practical knowledge at all, and only rely on peddling dogma and having empty reputations.

All of you, you can rest now! Now is the new era of the Great Leap Forward for the whole country. Look at how many young students and teachers have earnestly implemented the General Line and the communist educational policy of combining education with labor production. They have eliminated superstitions and liberated their minds, inventing and creating many new things that have caught up with or surpassed the world's advanced levels. Are you not ashamed? Time waits for no one. If you do not quickly and thoroughly examine your own thinking, correct your mistakes, transform yourselves in practical work, and make a great leap forward together with the people of the whole country, when will you wait? Do you intend to lag behind and be willing to stand outside the gate of communism?

    要向真理低头
    中共北京航空学院委员会第二书记  臧伯平
    党中央的“教育为工人阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的教育方针，更进一步鼓舞了广大青年学生和青年教师的干劲，不断地做出前人所不敢想不敢做的事情来。比如北京航空学院的师生职工，苦战一百昼夜就制造出一架轻型旅客机来，这不是奇迹吗？这不是前人没有想过干过的事情吗？短短一百昼夜，就把一架飞机造成了，其速度之快，效率之高，恐怕古今中外都无前例。这不是足以证明党的总路线的伟大和教育方针的正确吗？这不是证明了毛主席“破除迷信解放思想”的指示有巨大的推动力吗？
    可是，促退派和观潮派总是有的。有些人竟怀疑和反对中央这些英明的决定，特别对教育与生产劳动相结合的方针更加抗拒。认为学校就是一个念书的地方，学生就应当好好地读书。老师讲，学生听；老师出题目，学生答卷子；自古以来就是天经地义。至于劳动，那是庶民之事，堂堂的大学教授，文雅雅的大学生，怎能油手垢面地下厂去劳动呢？既失身份，又浪费时光。况且真的参加生产，既吃不了苦，又不会干，何如闭户抄书，背诵教条，到得意之际，写几篇论文，发几通宏论，名扬天下，利满囊中，岂不一举两得？因此名利熏心，资产阶级的个人主义大肆猖獗。因而对党中央教育结合生产劳动的共产主义教育方针，就大加反对。但这些人又不敢把真面目摆出来，不敢说自己怕吃苦，是草包，图名图利，只好推说学校搞生产妨害教学。学生参加生产影响学习质量。教授不是工程师，不能教学生实际操作。
    但是实际上是怎样呢？通过北京航空学院学生参加飞机生产和其他各种飞行器的生产，完全证明上述论调的荒谬。学生们参加生产不但没降低了学习质量，反而学到了真才实学。不但通过制造飞机和其他各种生产学会了实际的设计知识和学会了制造实物的操作技术，而且学习了在书本上所学不到的东西。这比只在毕业时画一张飞机三面图和随便假想一种飞机，在纸上谈兵的瞎画一阵强得多的多了。
    另外，教师直接参加生产，从中接触了不少的知识，这样就提高了他们的理论与科学技术水平，从而也就提高了他们今后教学的质量。不独此也，他们通过参加生产劳动还大大地改造了思想，提高了觉悟，加强了劳动观点和加深了对工人阶级的思想情感，这不比那种脱离实际，脱离生产的资产阶级教育有天上地下之别吗？
    当然也有些教师，自以为过去学的那些讲义公式可以吓唬青年同学，俘掳青年同学，自以为还有市场。但他们现在一接触实际，则大丢其丑，到实验室，不会做试验；到生产车间，不敢动机床。可是自己还不肯承认自己是草包，反而诡辩说：自己多年没搞了，撂生疏了。其实是连一点实际知识也没有，不过只凭贩卖教条，空有虚名而已。
    所有这些人，今天可以休矣！现在是全国大跃进的新时代，你们看看多少青年学生、教师认真地贯彻了总路线和教育与劳动生产相结合的共产主义教育方针，他们破除迷信解放了思想，发明创造了多少赶上或超过世界先进水平的新东西？你们不相形见绌吗？时不我待，如果还不急速猛省，认真地检查自己的思想，纠正自己的错误，在实际工作中改造自己，和全国人民在一道大跃进，还要等到什么时候呢？难道自甘下游、情愿站在共产主义的大门之外吗？
