Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 2nd. The "Indonesian Torch" newspaper reported today that some of the North Sulawesi rebels, defeated by the Indonesian government forces in Morotai and Jailolo in North Maluku, have fled to Dutch-occupied West Irian and have been organized into the Dutch regular army.

According to reports, this remnant of the rebel army totals 285 men, commanded by Pantoowu, an assistant to the rebel leader Soumual. Pantoowu recently flew to the Netherlands via Bangkok on a Dutch plane to discuss the issue of organizing this part of the rebel army.

In May of this year, Indonesian government forces launched an offensive against the rebels in Morotai and Jailolo. Among the 3,000 rebels who were defeated, 500, led by Pantoowu, fled to Sorong in West Irian on a Dutch patrol boat. Among these 500 rebels, some Indonesian soldiers and "student soldiers" from the former Dutch colonial army refused to go to West Irian, and only 285 were eventually transported there.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 2nd. Antara News Agency reported from Padang on the 1st that Indonesian government forces are conducting large-scale mopping-up operations in West Sumatra to crush some remaining rebel strongholds.

This military operation began last week. Air Force fighter planes, armored units, infantry, and artillery are participating in the operation, which is taking place in the areas near Bukittinggi, Matur, and Lake Maninjau.

The report said that the results of the mopping-up operation are not yet clear, but preliminary reports indicate that the operation is proceeding "satisfactorily." Government forces have seized a large amount of supplies and equipment from the rebels, and have killed and captured some rebels.

　　北苏拉威西叛军走投有路
    逃往西伊里安被编入荷兰正规军
    新华社雅加达2日电　“印度尼西亚火炬报”今天报道，在马鲁古北部的摩罗泰和济罗罗被印度尼西亚政府军击败的北苏拉威西的一部分叛军已经逃往荷兰占领的西伊里安，并且被组成荷兰正规军。
    据报道，这部分残余叛军总共有二百八十五名，由叛军首脑苏穆阿尔的助手潘托伍指挥。潘托伍最近乘荷兰飞机经曼谷飞往荷兰，去讨论这部分叛军的编制问题。
    在今年5月，印度尼西亚政府军向摩罗泰和济罗罗的叛军发动了进攻，在被击败的三千名叛军中，由潘托伍率领的五百人乘荷兰的一只巡逻船窜逃到西伊里安的梭弄。在这五百名叛军当中，由于一部分前荷兰殖民军中的印度尼西亚籍士兵和“学生军”拒绝去西伊里安，结果只有二百八十五名被运到那里。
    新华社雅加达2日电　据安塔拉通讯社巴东1日消息，印度尼西亚政府军正在西苏门答腊进行大规模的扫荡，以粉碎残余叛军的一些据点。
    这次军事行动是从上星期开始进行的。有空军战斗机、装甲部队、步兵和炮兵参加，地点是在武吉丁宜、马都尔和马宁饶湖附近地区。
    消息说，扫荡的结果还不清楚，但是初步的报告表明进行的情况“令人满意”。政府军已经从叛军手中缴获了大量物资和装备，并且打死和俘虏了一些叛军。
