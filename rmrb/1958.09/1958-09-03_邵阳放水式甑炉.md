　　Shaoyang Water-Discharging Steaming Furnace

    This kind of earthen furnace is very simple to build, costing only 350 yuan per unit. Each furnace produces 780 kilograms of iron per day.

    The workers of the Jinjiken Iron Factory in Lianyuan County, Shaoyang Special District, Hunan Province, improved the traditional earthen steaming furnace into a water-discharging earthen iron smelting furnace, increasing the daily output of pig iron from the original 300 kilograms to 780 kilograms.

    The construction of the steaming furnace is very simple. The furnace body consists of two sections of mud-made cylinders (each section is 1.8 meters long and 0.37 meters in diameter), stacked on a cast pot (the iron pot weighs about 30 kilograms), supported by a wrought iron tripod, and then bound with iron hoops. The outside of the furnace body is vertically inserted with flat iron sheets. The entire furnace only requires 100 kilograms of wrought iron. After the furnace is built, two pillars are erected at one end, and two wooden strips are used to clamp the furnace. The internal structure of the furnace is also very simple, with few tools needed, only a few furnace iron rods (each about 1 meter long and 7 kilograms in weight), a bellows, and an iron ladle for pouring water. For hundreds of years, these steaming furnaces have always used wooden strips to clamp the furnace when pouring molten iron. This sometimes poses the danger of the furnace tipping over, failing to guarantee safety. At the same time, because the furnace needs to cool down every time molten iron is poured, the melting power is reduced, resulting in low output and poor quality, with a maximum daily output of only 300 kilograms, and each furnace loading only produces for about ten days.

    During the Great Leap Forward, the factory workers overcame conservative ideas, broke with convention, and converted the original water-pouring furnace into a water-discharging furnace. In the past, everyone thought it was impossible to discharge water from a steaming furnace, but now, as long as the fuel quality is hard enough, it can be converted into a water-discharging furnace. By opening a water-discharging door on the side of the furnace, the steaming furnace can flow out molten iron like a small blast furnace. After this improvement, the furnace has many advantages: (1) There is no danger of the furnace tipping over, ensuring safety; (2) It reduces the number of times the furnace cools down, increasing the output to a maximum of 780 kilograms, while also improving the quality; (3) It saves timber and reduces infrastructure costs; (4) It extends the furnace's production days. Now, each furnace loading can produce for an average of more than 30 days, which is more than double the previous average.

    Steaming furnace iron smelting is a traditional method without any mechanical devices. If attention is not paid to the furnace operation methods, problems may occur at any time. Therefore, in operation, every small detail must be carefully considered. The workers of the Jinjiken Iron Factory, through unremitting exploration, have summarized the operating methods that must be strictly followed:

    (1) The furnace loading and burning operation should be determined according to the quality of the coal. If the coal is hard, the furnace belly should be loaded larger (looser); if the coal is not hard, the furnace belly should be loaded smaller (tighter). Because if the coal is hard and loaded less, the output will not be high; if the coal is soft and loaded more, the coal will break when compressed. The furnace should be burned tightly rather than loosely. Burning tightly means blocking the furnace door with a stirring rod and burning the furnace tightly closed.

    (2) Pay attention to the coordination of the air supply and the furnace (what workers call "air distribution"), which is an important technical issue. The stronger the air supply, the better, so you should always pay attention to the air volume of the bellows. The direction of the air supply in the steaming furnace is: the air blows from the bottom of the rear wall of the lower section of the furnace at the air door to the opposite wall, rotates back, and rises up. If the air blows up, the air is too warm, and the bottom of the furnace is cold, the molten iron will solidify when it comes down, and the molten iron will not be clear; if the air blows down, the air cannot rise, the temperature decreases, and it cannot melt; if it blows to the side, the air is uneven, the heat is inconsistent, and the furnace will not melt well.

    (3) Strictly master the technology of loading and adding raw materials and fuel. This kind of earthen furnace often changes. If the furnace is good and the raw materials are loaded lightly, the output will not be high; if the furnace is not good and the raw materials are loaded heavily, it will rot, and it may not even be able to produce iron. To address these problems, they adopt the operating methods of loading less and adding frequently, watching the charcoal to add ore, and watching the ore to add charcoal (that is, if the coal is good, add more ore, if the coal is not good, add less ore, and use scales to ensure that the layers are even), and burning the furnace tightly closed. At the same time, keep the furnace full at all times, which not only ensures that the furnace does not rot, but also greatly improves the output and quality.

    (4) Replace the rocks and air pipes (air pipes blowing air into the furnace) in a timely manner. There are three rocks installed at the furnace mouth, the one below is called the lower mounting stone, the one above is called the upper mounting stone, and a piece of white sandstone called rock is installed below the upper mounting stone. These rocks often break, and if they are not replaced in time, the furnace will rot. Because the air pipe is made of mud and sand, it is easy to melt, and when it melts to a very short length, it must be replaced quickly, otherwise the furnace will also rot. Therefore, the rocks and air pipes need to be replaced every day, and each replacement must be completed within ten minutes, otherwise the furnace will cool down and affect production.

    (5) Ensure the quality of raw materials and fuel. The coal quality must be hard, the harder the better; the ore sand should be roasted, then hammered into small pieces, each with a diameter of 0.6 to 0.8 "shi cun" (approximately 2-2.6 cm). The ratio of raw materials and fuel consumption mainly depends on the quality of the raw materials and fuel. The factory's ore consumption is 3.3 tons per ton of iron (with an iron content of 32%); the coal consumption per ton of pig iron is 2.2 tons, and if white coal is used, it only needs 1.9 to 2 tons.

    Building steaming furnaces is intended to use traditional methods to achieve the goal of smelting iron in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Therefore, the construction of steaming furnaces should start from economic saving, and they can be built with local cohesive raw loess. It generally only takes three days from construction to putting into production, and the service life is generally six months, up to a year. In areas where conditions permit, 20% of rice straw fibers or kudzu fibers soaked in water can be added to the raw loess, and then pounded with a stick until there are no long stem fibers in the soil. Furnaces made of this material structure can enhance crystallization ability and durability, and can extend the life of the furnace. The general service life can reach one year, and the longest can reach more than two years.

　　邵阳放水式甑炉
    这种土炉建造很简单，每座投资只350多元。每炉日产生铁780公斤。
    湖南省邵阳专区涟源县金鸡坑铁厂的职工，将土法甑炉改良成为放水式土炼铁炉，使生铁日产量由原来的三百公斤提高到七百八十公斤。
    甑炉的建设很简单，炉身就是两节泥制的圆筒（每节长1.8公尺，直径0.37公尺），重叠起来放在铸锅上（铁锅重约三十公斤），用熟铁三角架架起来，然后箍上铁箍，炉身外面用扁铁皮直插着，整座炉子只需熟铁一百公斤。炉堆打好后，在一端竖两只柱子，用两根木条夹住炉子。炉内装置也很简单，工具不多，只要用几根烧炉铁棍（每根长约一公尺，重约七公斤），一只风箱，一只倒水铁杓。几百年来，这种甑炉一直都是用木条夹住炉子倒铁水，这样有时有倒炉的危险，不能保证安全，同时因为每倒一次铁水，炉子就要冷却一次，降低熔化力，所以产量不高，质量也不好，最高日产量不过三百公斤，每装一次炉只能生产十几天。
    大跃进中，这个厂的职工克服保守思想，打破了陈规，把原来的倒水炉改成放水炉。过去大家认为甑炉放水是不可能的，可是现在只要燃料质量硬一点，就可以改为放水炉。在炉侧面开一扇放水门，甑炉就能像小高炉一样地流出铁水。经过这种改良，炉子有很多优点：（1）没有倒炉的危险，能保证安全；（2）减少了炉子的冷却次数，提高了产量，最高达七百八十公斤，同时质量也好；（3）节约木材，降低基建成本；（4）延长了炉子的生产日，现在装一次炉平均可以生产三十多天，比过去平均提高一倍以上。
    甑炉炼铁是土办法，没有什么机械装置，如果不注意炉子操作方法，随时可能出问题，所以在操作中每个细小的环节都要十分注意。金鸡坑铁厂的职工经过坚持不懈的探索，总结出必须严格掌握的操作方法：
    （一）装炉烧炉操作要根据煤质而定。煤质硬，炉肚装大一点（松一点）；煤不硬，炉肚就装小一点（紧一点）。因为煤硬装少了产量不高；煤软装大了，煤一受压就碎了。烧炉时宜紧不宜松。所谓紧就是用搅棍堵住炉门，闭炉紧烧。
      （二）注意风力与炉子的配合（工人叫作配气），这是一个重要的技术问题。风力越足越好，所以要经常注意风箱的风量。甑炉风力的走向是：风从炉的下节后墙下部风门处吹到对墙上回转来，转一圈升上去。如果风吹上了，风太暖，而炉底却是冷的，铁水下来就会凝结，铁水不清；风吹下了，风力不能上升，温度降低，不能熔化；吹偏了，风力不匀，热度不一，炉子熔化也不好。
      （三）严格掌握装添原料、燃料的技术。这种土炉子时常有变化，炉子好，原料下轻了，产量不高；炉子不好，原料下重了就会烂，甚至不能出铁。针对这些问题，他们采取少装勤添、看炭下矿、看矿下炭（即煤好矿砂多一点，煤不好矿砂少一点，要用秤称，做到层次均匀）、闭炉紧烧的操作方法。同时，经常保持炉内饱满，既保证了炉子不烂，又可大大提高产量、质量。
      （四）及时换岩石和风管（吹风进炉的风管）。炉门口装有三块岩，下面的叫下马石，上面的叫上马石，上马石下面陪装一块白砂碇叫岩石。这种岩石经常坏，如果不及时更换，就会烂炉子。风管因为是泥砂做的，容易熔化，熔到很短的时候，就要赶快换，否则也会烂炉子。所以岩石和风管需要每天换一次，每次要在十分钟内换好，否则炉子冷却，影响生产。
      （五）要保证原料、燃料质量。煤质要硬，越硬越好；矿砂焙热后捶碎成小块，每块直径以0.6市寸至0.8市寸为宜。原料、燃料消耗比重，主要是随原料、燃料的质量而定。这个厂的矿砂消耗，每吨铁要3.3吨（含铁量32％）；每吨生铁耗煤2.2吨，如果用白煤，则只需要1.9到2吨。
    建筑甑炉是为了使用土法达到多快好省炼铁的目的，所以甑炉的建筑应该从经济节约出发，可以采用本地带有粘性的生黄土建成，从建成到投入生产一般只要三天时间，使用时间一般为六个月，最长一年。有条件的地方，还可以在生黄土里适当掺配20％用水浸过的稻草筋或葛麻，然后用棒捶击，直到土里没有长形茎条丝为止。这种材料结构的炉子，能增强结晶的能力和耐用性，能够延长炉子的寿命，一般使用期可到一年，最长能到两年多。
