　　Overall Planning, Division of Labor and Cooperation
    Shanxi Rectifies Local Industry

    (Our dispatch) Shanxi Province has adopted a method of overall planning to vigorously rectify and consolidate county, township, and commune-run local industries. Generally, they are addressing new problems brought about by the current great leap forward, focusing on how local industries can better serve the great leap forward in agricultural production, to carry out ideological debates and organizational rectification.

    In the mass movement of the whole party and all people running industries in Shanxi Province, more than 100,000 medium-sized and small factories were established in just a few months, distributed in vast urban and rural areas, providing more fertilizers, farm tools and various means of production. The great development of local industry has strongly supported the great leap forward in agricultural production. However, the current problems are the lack of unified planning and division of labor and cooperation between large, medium, and small industries. In some places, the direction of production is not clear after the establishment. In production, there are also problems of unreasonable allocation of raw materials, duplication of industry types, and waste in the use of resources and equipment.

    Many areas in Shanxi Province have taken measures of overall planning, division of labor and cooperation to conduct unified production planning and division of labor and cooperation for county, township, and commune industries, aiming at the above-mentioned situation. Changzhi Special District stipulates the scope of production division of labor and the principles of cooperation for county, township, and commune local industries as follows: the industry of agricultural cooperatives should focus on running farm tool repair and assembly, fertilizer, flour milling, and mining production to provide raw materials for county and township industries; the township focuses on farm tool manufacturing, light industrial food processing and providing raw materials for industries above the county level; the county focuses on developing backbone industries to equip township and commune industries and balance various agricultural production materials needed throughout the county. This division of labor promotes mutual cooperation and common development between large, medium, and small industries. In the past, Yangcheng, Hongzhao, and other counties experienced disputes between commune, township, and county-run industries and large industries for raw materials due to unclear division of labor, which caused large industries to have no work to do and shut down and wait for materials, while small industries could not fully utilize raw materials due to the limitation of equipment conditions. After rectification, this situation was corrected and cooperation was strengthened. Gaoping County also implemented the method of separate industrial management to strengthen the leadership of division of labor and cooperation, delegating the management power of handicraft cooperatives to the townships. This greatly facilitated mutual cooperation, changed the phenomenon that "the township cannot manage it, and the county cannot control it" in the past, and a new atmosphere emerged where agricultural cooperatives drew labor and engaged in mining to support industry, and industry provided more means of production for agriculture, ensuring the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production.

    During the rectification in various places, debates were first conducted on how commune-run industries serve agricultural production, criticizing the erroneous viewpoint and practice of simply seeking profit and neglecting service to agricultural production. Two methods were adopted for rectification. One is to classify by industry, that is, to merge the industries run by agricultural cooperatives into five categories: fertilizer processing, farm tool repair and assembly, agricultural and sideline product processing, sewing, and building materials; the other method is to use the township as a network, using the method of uniformly formulating industrial production plans to unify and organize various industries into joint processing plants in the whole township, under the unified leadership and planned production of the township. Both methods have many benefits. It can reasonably solve problems such as industry duplication and waste of human resources. It can also save the management cadres and technicians of each factory, which is conducive to carrying out the technical innovation movement, facilitating the centralized use of equipment and the utilization of resources, so as to better serve agricultural production. After rectifying Daqu Township in Anyi County, which had 171 factories, each township established a unified leading management organization and formulated a production plan, changing the chaotic state of production without management in the past. Each factory carries out production according to this overall plan, combined with the specific needs of the agricultural cooperative. In this way, nearly 300 full-time cadres were needed in the past, but now only a few are needed.

    Regarding the balance between the development of backbone industries and other industries, and regarding the combination of consolidation and development, new arrangements have also been made in various places according to local conditions.

### 统筹安排  分工协作  山西整顿地方工业

　　统筹安排  分工协作
    山西整顿地方工业
    本报讯　山西省各地采取统筹安排的办法，大力整顿巩固县、乡、社地方工业。一般都针对当前大发展所带来的新问题，围绕地方工业如何更好地为农业生产大跃进服务，来开展思想辩论和进行组织整顿。
    山西省在全党全民办工业运动中，仅在几个月的时间内，就建立起了十万多个中、小型工厂，分布在广大城乡，提供了更多的肥料、农具和各种生产资料。地方工业的大发展，有力地支援了农业生产的大跃进。但当前的问题是，大、中、小工业之间缺乏统一规划和分工协作，有些地方，办起来以后生产方向不明确。在生产中还存在着原料分配不合理，行业品种重复，以及资源和设备利用上的浪费现象。
    山西省不少地区已针对上述情况采取统筹安排、分工协作的办法，对县、乡、社工业进行了生产统一规划和分工协作。长治专区规定县、乡、社地方工业的生产分工范围和协作的原则是：农业社的工业，要以举办农具修配、肥料、磨面和为县乡工业提供原料的采矿生产为主；乡以农具修造、轻工业副食品加工和为县以上的工业提供原材料为主；县则着重发展骨干工业，以装备乡、社工业和平衡全县需要的各种农业生产资料。这样分工以后，促进了大、中、小型工业的相互协作，共同发展。阳城洪赵等县过去由于县乡社工业分工不明确，曾发生了社、乡、县办工业和大工业争原料，致使大工业没活干，停工待料，而小工业却由于设备条件的限制使原料不能得到充分的利用。经过整顿以后，得到了纠正，加强了协作。高平县为加强分工协作的领导，还实行了工业分设管理的办法，把手工业社的管理权力下放到乡，这样，大大便利了相互协作，改变了过去“乡管不了，县管不到”的现象，出现了农业社抽劳力、搞矿石支援工业，工业为农业更多地提供生产资料的新气象，保证了农业生产大跃进的需要。
    各地整顿中，首先进行了社办工业如何为农业生产服务的辩论，批判了单纯为营利而忽视为农业生产服务的错误观点和做法。并采取了两种办法进行整顿。一种是按行业归口，就是把农业社办工业归并为肥料加工、农具修配、农副产品加工、缝纫和建筑材料五大类；另一种办法，是以乡为网，用统一制订工业生产计划的办法，把各个行业统一组织起来，成为全乡的联合加工厂，由乡统一领导、计划生产。这两种作法，都有很多好处。它可以使行业重复和人力资源浪费等问题得到合理解决。还可节省各个厂的管理干部、技术人员，有利于开展技术革新运动，便于集中使用设备和利用资源，以此来更好地为农业生产服务。安邑县大渠乡办起一百七十一个工厂，在最近经过整顿后，各乡成立了统一的领导管理机构，制订了生产计划，改变了过去生产无人管理的混乱状态。各个工厂按照这个总的计划，结合农业社具体需要进行生产。这样，过去全乡需要近三百个脱产干部，现在只用几个人就行了。
    关于骨干工业和其它工业发展的平衡问题，关于巩固与发展相结合的问题，各地也根据当地具体情况，做了新的安排。
