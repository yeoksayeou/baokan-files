    Thoroughly Implement the Socialist Education Policy
    Leading Cadres of Shenyang Higher and Secondary Vocational Schools Discuss Comrade Lu Dingyi's Article
    (Our reporters Wen Shuxian and Sun Zunian report) "Thoroughly implement the socialist education policy, deeply carry out the education revolution, and plant red flags in all areas of school work," this was proposed by the leading cadres of universities and secondary vocational schools in Shenyang City at a meeting to study the Party's education policy.

    This study meeting was convened by the Higher Education Department of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee. Party committee secretaries, presidents, and principals from twenty-two universities and secondary vocational schools in the city participated in the study. The comrades attending the meeting conscientiously studied and discussed Comrade Lu Dingyi's article "Education Must Be Combined with Productive Labor," which enhanced their understanding, armed their minds, and strengthened their confidence in their work. In their speeches, many comrades mentioned that in the past, their understanding of issues such as the education policy, school management line, training goals, and Party leadership was vague. In particular, they could not clearly distinguish the specific manifestations of the two-line struggle in schools, so they did not dare to lead boldly and did not implement the socialist education policy firmly and thoroughly enough. The Party leading cadres of Shenyang Medical College used to have a vague understanding of the difference between socialist universities and capitalist universities. They were once surrounded by bourgeois intellectuals. Although the school was nominally led by the Party, bourgeois ideology actually occupied the position. After the rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the struggle to implement the Party's education policy, the Party's leading cadres became clear-headed and dared to lead boldly. When the school implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, some people opposed it. They said that work-study programs would disrupt the system, science, regularity, and logic of education; would reduce the quality of teaching; would be a waste of talent; and would hinder the development of science; they emphasized the special nature of hospitals and said that they could not be combined with productive labor. The Party committee led the teachers and students of the whole college in a resolute struggle against those who advocated the bourgeois school management line of separating education from productive labor and education from reality. The broad masses of teachers and students not only participated in industrial and agricultural production, and the school ran factories, but also recently sent more than 2,600 teachers and students to factories, rural areas, and streets to conduct large-scale social surveys, laying the ideological and material foundation for the current teaching and medical reform. Zhang Peikai, principal of Shenyang Nonferrous Metals School, said that in the past, he mistakenly believed that he was an "outsider" in running education and did not dare to check the work of teachers. Now that his mind has been liberated, he dares to check their work. Recently, when the school arranged the teaching plan, the teachers still regarded labor and political activities as ancillary courses. After the school Party committee checked and made suggestions, the teachers included labor and politics as the main content of the teaching plan.

    Combining study with discussion, the meeting analyzed the current situation of higher and secondary vocational schools in Shenyang City. Everyone believed that the struggle between the two roads and two methods in school management is still sharp. Although the socialist revolution in politics and ideology has achieved a decisive victory after the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, bourgeois school management ideology and bourgeois individualism have been severely attacked, but bourgeois school management ideology has not been completely defeated, the socialist education policy has not been fully implemented, and in particular, bourgeois academic ideology has not been thoroughly criticized.

    Based on the current situation of the schools, the meeting proposed that the future tasks are: to deeply carry out the education revolution, thoroughly implement the socialist education policy, and plant red flags in all areas of school work; under the premise of strengthening the Party's organizational leadership and ideological leadership, adopt the mass line methods of large-scale airing of views, large-character posters, and large-scale debates; to continue to consolidate and expand the achievements of work-study programs, so that education is closely combined with productive labor. The school's productive labor should be combined with the profession as much as possible. On the existing basis, the school's productive labor should be improved one step further. In terms of industrial production, Shenyang's engineering colleges and secondary vocational schools have better equipment and should manufacture complete sets of metallurgical equipment and power generation equipment, large-scale, precision machine tools and precision instruments, and smelt iron, steel, and various high-grade steels. The production of these products is not only needed by the state, but also improves the quality of teaching. At the same time, it is necessary to combine work-study programs with scientific research, so that schools become the leading bases for technological innovation and train talents that meet the requirements of the country.

    全面贯彻社会主义教育方针
    沈阳高等、中等专业学校领导干部讨论陆定一同志的文章
    本报讯　记者温述仙、孙祖年报道：“全面贯彻社会主义教育方针，深入开展教育革命，在学校工作的一切领域上插遍红旗”，这是沈阳市高等院校和中等专业学校的领导干部，在学习党的教育方针的会议上提出来的。
    这次学习会是中共沈阳市委高教部召集的，全市有二十二个大学和中等专业学校党委书记、院、校长参加了学习。与会同志认真学习与讨论了陆定一同志的“教育必须与生产劳动相结合”的文章，提高了认识，武装了头脑，加强了工作信心。在发言中，许多同志都谈到，过去对教育方针、办学路线、培养目标和党的领导等等问题认识模糊，特别是对两条路线斗争在学校中具体的表现形态分辨不清，因此不敢大胆领导，贯彻社会主义教育方针不够坚决彻底。沈阳医学院党的领导干部，过去对社会主义大学与资本主义大学的区别认识模糊，曾经一度被资产阶级知识分子包围，学校在表面上是党领导，实际上是资产阶级思想占领了阵地。经过整风、反右派斗争、贯彻党的教育方针的斗争，党的领导干部头脑清楚了，于是敢于大胆地进行领导。当学校贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的时候，有些人反对这样做。他们说，勤工俭学会打乱教育的系统性、科学性、正规性、逻辑性；会降低教学质量，是浪费人才，阻碍科学的发展；强调医院特殊，不能与生产劳动相结合。党委领导全院师生与主张教育脱离生产劳动、教育脱离实际的资产阶级办学路线的人进行了坚决的斗争。广大师生不仅参加了工农业生产，学校办了工厂，而且在最近还派了二千六百多名师生深入工厂、农村、街道，进行大规模的社会调查，为当前正在开展的教学医疗改革打下了思想和物质基础。沈阳有色金属学校校长张培开说，过去错误地认为自己对办教育是“外行”，不敢检查教师的工作。现在思想解放了，就敢于去检查他们的工作。最近这个学校安排教学计划，教师仍然把劳动、政治活动作为附带的课程。经过学校党委检查提出意见以后，教师才把劳动和政治列为教学计划的主要内容。
    会议结合学习讨论，分析了当前沈阳市高等院校和中等专业学校的情况，大家认为，现在，各个学校在办学问题上两条道路和两种方法的斗争仍然是尖锐的。虽然经过整风和反右派斗争，政治上思想上的社会主义革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，资产阶级办学思想和资产阶级个人主义受到严重的打击，但是资产阶级办学思想并未彻底打垮，社会主义教育方针还没有全面贯彻，特别是资产阶级的学术思想也还没有得到彻底批判。
    根据当前学校的形势，会议提出今后的任务是：深入开展教育革命，全面贯彻社会主义教育方针，在学校工作的一切领域上插遍红旗；在加强党的组织领导和思想领导的前提下，采用大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论的群众路线方法；要继续巩固和扩大勤工俭学的成果，使教育紧密地结合生产劳动。学校的生产劳动要尽可能和专业结合起来，在现有的基础上，应该把学校的生产劳动提高一步。在工业生产方面，沈阳工科性的高、中等专业学校设备较好，应该制造整套的冶金设备和发电设备，制造大型、精密机床和精密仪器，炼铁、炼钢、炼各种高级钢种。生产这些产品不仅国家需要，而且也提高了教学质量。同时，要使勤工俭学与科学研究结合起来，使学校成为技术革新先行的基地，培养出适应国家要求的人材。
