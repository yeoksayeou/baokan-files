Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangsu provinces have separately conducted pilot work using Hanyu Pinyin to assist in literacy campaigns, consolidate literacy skills, and improve self-learning abilities, achieving great success.

The Shandong Provincial Department of Education first trained over a hundred literacy cadres in May of this year. From late June to early August, Pinyin literacy pilot programs were conducted in four townships, two communes, one factory, and one residents' literacy class in five counties and cities: Pingyuan, Licheng, Sishui, Xin County, and Jinan. In these locations, 1,799 people's teachers were trained, and 141 classes and 13 groups were established, in addition to some individually tutored students. A total of 5,274 students participated in the learning, most of whom were illiterate or semi-literate.

From June 10th to August 20th, the Hebei Provincial Department of Education conducted pilot programs among 261 workers at the Baoding Carpet Factory and 259 farmers in five villages in Dongting Township, Ding County. Of these 520 people, 275 were illiterate or semi-literate, and 245 had already completed literacy courses.

Around March of this year, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education conducted experimental teaching of Hanyu Pinyin literacy at the Shibuqiao Production Team in Qixia Mountain, Nanjing, and the Huaqi Agricultural Cooperative in Daqiao Township, Jiangpu County. Each location ran a class, with a total of 46 students, including both illiterate and semi-literate individuals.

According to Shandong's experience, an illiterate or semi-literate person generally only needs 10 to 12 hours to learn Pinyin, which can then be used to annotate Chinese characters. Some semi-literate classes in Pingyuan County took only seven to eight hours. Fu Xiuying, a housewife from Dongwangzhuang Township, Pingyuan County, learned Pinyin in six hours under the individual tutoring of people's teacher Xing Chunhuan. All twenty-five literacy classes in Shuiquan Township, Sishui County, learned Pinyin in 10 to 12 hours.

In Hebei Province, after seven to twelve lessons (each lasting one to one and a half hours) of Pinyin teaching, most students were able to master the Pinyin method, pronounce and silently write syllables. A small number of students were able to use Pinyin proficiently; for example, worker Yang Runsheng from the Baoding Carpet Factory and student Chen Junxiu from Yuanguang Village in Ding County were able to write letters and keep diaries using Pinyin. Most of the worker students at the Baoding Carpet Factory basically mastered the four tones of Beijing pronunciation.

In Jiangsu, it took twelve evenings (over an hour each night) to learn Pinyin at Qixia Mountain, while it took only nine evenings at Huaqi Cooperative.

The pilot work in these three provinces proves that Pinyin is not difficult to learn, and workers and peasants can generally learn it in just over ten hours.

After the students learn Pinyin, they enter the intensive Chinese character phase. Shandong and Jiangsu's method involves two steps: first, using homophone lists to memorize 1,500 common characters, then reading annotated texts or teaching writing. Hebei's method is to directly read annotated texts and memorize new characters within the text. It takes about a month (30 to 45 hours) for an illiterate or semi-literate person to progress from learning the alphabet to reaching the standard for literacy graduation. Adult illiterates can self-learn new characters through Pinyin, based on the context, without a teacher. At this time, the students' enthusiasm is at its highest. Zhou Jinlan of Huaqi Cooperative in Jiangsu self-learned the characters "tu" and "zhou" in the slogan "突击三昼夜" (storming for three days and nights) on an annotated banner, and clapped her hands with joy. Zhang Jixi, a warehouse porter at the Chengdu Textile Mill in Jinan (who used to be completely illiterate), read through 52 annotated lessons in just eight days, basically mastered 1,500 Chinese characters, was able to read "Pinyin Small Newspaper", and could write short articles of over 100 words. Che Guiping from Xin County, Shandong, was so happy to learn Pinyin that he couldn't stop smiling, saying to everyone he met, "In the past, I couldn't learn a single character, and I ran my legs off asking people to teach me. Now, when I encounter a character I don't know, I just open my mouth and spell it out." The masses in Dongting Township, Ding County, Hebei, call Pinyin the "silent teacher" and the "magic weapon for literacy." They say, "If you don't know a character, you can spell it out, and if you forget it, you can spell it back."

The pilot programs in Shandong and Hebei prove that Pinyin can consolidate literacy achievements and improve reading ability. Wang Meirong, a 37-year-old housewife from Huwangzhuang, Pingyuan County, Shandong, spent seven days in the spring of this year to intensively learn 1,500 characters and was called "Female Champion." Later, due to busy production, learning stopped, and she forgot 673 characters, or 44%. This time, she spent nine hours learning Pinyin and used seven lunch breaks to read the annotated literacy textbook, and as a result, she "found back" 672 of the 673 characters she had forgotten. An article in "Pinyin Small Newspaper" entitled "The Taiqian Cooperative Produced 3,175 Jin of Wheat per Mu," contained a total of 445 characters, of which 22 were new characters. Relying on Pinyin, she quickly read this short article. She tamed all 22 obstacles with Pinyin. She proudly said, "After learning Pinyin, no matter what book, as long as it has annotations, I can read it." Zeng Zhaolian from Zhangmatun, Licheng County, Shandong (who originally knew 700 characters), read 24 lessons of the annotated literacy textbook in one day after learning Pinyin, and finished all 52 lessons on the third day. According to Hebei Province's experience, before learning Pinyin, students who had already graduated from literacy courses all experienced varying degrees of forgetting. After studying the annotated first volume of the amateur primary school cultural and technical textbook, in addition to "re-familiarizing" themselves with the forgotten characters, they learned more than 500 new characters, and the quality of learning was generally better.

Shandong and Hebei are now continuing to train teachers and have decided to compile and print Pinyin Small Newspapers and annotated readings, preparing to promote Pinyin comprehensively in all counties and cities in a planned and active manner.

    是“不说话的老师”是“识字的法宝”
    用拼音字母扫盲又快又好
    山东、河北、江苏试点工作获很大成绩
    新华社16日讯　山东、河北、江苏三省分别进行了用汉语拼音字母帮助扫盲、巩固识字、提高自学能力的试点工作，获得很大成功。
    山东省教育厅先在今年5月训练了一百多名扫盲干部，从6月下旬到8月初，在平原、历城、泗水、莘县、济南五个县市的四个乡、两个社、一个工厂、一个市民识字班进行了拼音字母扫盲试点。在以上各点训练了民师一千七百九十九人，开办了一百四十一个班，十三个小组，另外还有部分包教的学员。参加学习的学员共五千二百七十四人，其中大部分是文盲和半文盲。
    河北省教育厅从6月10日到8月20日，在保定地毯厂的二百六十一名工人和定县东亭乡的五个村的二百五十九名农民中作了试点。这五百二十人中，文盲和半文盲二百七十五人，已经扫盲结业的二百四十五人。
    江苏省教育厅于今年3月前后，分别在南京市栖霞山石埠桥生产队和江浦县大桥乡花旗农业社，进行汉语拼音字母扫盲实验教学。这两个点各办了一班，学员包括文盲和半文盲共四十六人。
    根据山东的经验，一个文盲或半文盲，一般只要十到十二小时就可以学会拼音字母，能用来给汉字注音。平原县有些半文盲班，只用七到八个小时。平原县董王庄乡的家庭妇女傅秀英，在民师邢春环的包教下，六小时就学会了拼音字母。泗水县水泉乡的二十五个扫盲班，都是用十到十二小时学会拼音字母的。
    河北省的各个试点，一般经过七到十二次课（每次一小时至一个半小时）教学拼音字母之后，绝大部分学员都能掌握拼音方法，拼读和默写音节。少数学员能够熟练运用拼音字母，例如保定地毯厂工人杨润生，定县元光村学员陈俊秀，他们能用拼音字母写信和记日记。保定地毯厂的多数工人学员，基本上掌握了北京语音的四个声调。
    江苏的栖霞山点用十二个晚上（每晚一个多小时），花旗社只用九个晚上，就学会了拼音。
    这三个省的试点工作证明：拼音字母并不难学，工人农民一般只要十几个小时就可以学会。
    学员们学会了拼音字母之后，接着就进入突击汉字的阶段。山东和江苏的办法分两步走：先用同音字表记一千五百个生字，然后读注音的课文或教学写作。河北的办法是直接读注音的课文，在课文中记生字。一个文盲或半文盲，从学习字母到达到扫盲结业的标准，大约需要一个月（三十来个小时至四十五小时）。成年文盲可以通过拼音，根据上下文自学生字，无师自通。这个时候学员们的情绪最高，劲头最大。江苏花旗社周金兰在注音标语上，自学了“突击三昼夜”中的“突”、“昼”两个字，高兴得拍起手来。济南市成通纱厂仓库搬运工人张继喜（过去是个一字不识的文盲），只用八天时间就读完了五十二课注音的课文，基本上掌握了一千五百个汉字，能够阅读“拼音小报”，还能写一百多字的短文。山东莘县车贵平学会了拼音，高兴得合不上嘴，逢人就说：“过去一字学不会，找人教给跑折腿。现在遇到字不识，把嘴一张就拼会。”河北定县东亭乡的群众，把拼音字母叫做“不说话的老师”，“识字的法宝”。他们说：“不识的字一拼就拼出来，忘了也能拼回来。”
    山东和河北的试点证明：拼音字母可以巩固扫盲成果，可以提高阅读能力。山东平原县户王庄三十七岁的家庭妇女王美荣，今年春季用七天时间就突击识了一千五百个字，被称为“女状元”。后来因为生产繁忙，学习停顿，回生了六百七十三个字，即44％。这次她用了九小时学会了拼音字母，利用七个中午做饭和吃饭前后的时间，阅读了注音识字课本，结果把原来已经回生的六百七十三个字“找回来了”六百七十二个。“拼音小报”上的一篇短文“台前社二亩小麦亩产三千一百七十五斤”，共四百四十五字，其中有二十二个生字。她依靠拼音，把这篇短文很快就念完了。二十二个拦路虎，都让她用拼音字母驯服了。她自豪地说：“我学了拼音，不管什么书，只要有注音，我都能念了。”山东历城县张马屯曾召莲（原来识七百字）学会拼音字母以后，一天就阅读了注音识字课本二十四课，第三天就把五十二课都读完了。根据河北省的经验，原来已经扫盲结业的学员，在学习拼音字母之前，都有不同程度的回生现象。他们学习了注音的业余小学文化技术课本第一册之后，除了把回生的字又“回熟”了以外，又多识了五百个以上的生字，而且学习的质量一般都比较好。
    山东和河北现在正在继续训练师资，并且决定编印拼音小报和注音读物，准备有步骤地、积极地在各县市全面推广。
