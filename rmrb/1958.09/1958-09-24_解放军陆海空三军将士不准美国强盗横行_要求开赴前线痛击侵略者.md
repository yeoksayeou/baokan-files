Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: In a single day and night, new anti-aggression anger reignited like wildfire among all branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. At countless gatherings, the Army, Navy, and Air Force soldiers unanimously supported Foreign Minister Chen Yi's solemn statement and were determined to recover Jinmen and Mazu, and liberate Taiwan, vowing to fight to the end for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland. They also angrily warned the American aggressors that if they did not immediately withdraw their claws, get out of Taiwan, and continue to act recklessly, "offending the Grand Duke of Jupiter," then a doubled and devastating counterattack awaited them!

The land, sea, and air forces stationed on the southeast coast, who had long been waiting in battle readiness, unanimously expressed at multiple gatherings on the 21st: Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan are our flesh and blood, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is a thorn in our side. We will never allow American imperialism to hinder us from pulling out the thorns. If it is still obsessed and continues to hinder us from pulling out the thorns, we have enough power to destroy it together with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Han Yuyan, the pilot who shot down an American-made Chiang Kai-shek plane on the 18th, said: Our determination to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan is stronger than steel and harder than jade. For the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, I would not hesitate to shed blood and sacrifice my life!

The vast number of officers and soldiers in the Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Jinan and other regional troops were furious and indignant at Dulles' shameless lies at the United Nations General Assembly. Colonel Li Yiting said that reversing black and white and confusing right and wrong are the usual tricks of aggressors. No matter how Dulles clamors, truth and justice can never be changed, and Taiwan is still Chinese territory. Meng Xianzhang, who was rated as a third-class combat hero in the Liberation War, said angrily that the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands is a continuation of the civil war with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous army for many years. What does it have to do with the United States? But the American Secretary of State Dulles, who occupies our territory of Taiwan, instead falsely accused us of "aggression." This is the logic of a robber. We want to warn Dulles that we know how to deal with robbers.

The officers and soldiers stationed in Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, Kunming, Zhengzhou and other regions, with unrestrained anger, submitted letters of determination, demanding to go to the front lines to meet and severely strike the aggressors. They said that the Chinese people have never succumbed to the threat of war. In order to oppose the aggression of Japanese imperialism, the Chinese people launched a nationwide war of resistance and achieved the final victory. If American imperialism is blind and insists on carrying out a war of aggression against us, then a more tragic fate than that of Japanese imperialism awaits them. Li Ciman, a soldier from a certain unit of the Guangzhou troops, said that if the American aggressors do not get out of the Taiwan region as soon as possible, we will tighten the noose and strangle them to death. Officers and soldiers of an air force unit and a naval school who are undergoing air and sea training said that we are ready and waiting for the motherland's orders at any time to drive away the American robbers who invaded our territory. Officers and soldiers of the railway corps, who are building railways in southern China, are determined to accelerate the construction of the Mindian trunk line and support the fraternal troops to liberate Jinmen and Mazu and liberate Taiwan as soon as possible.

The vast number of military officers who assist in training the militia in various regions have sworn to the motherland together with the militia everywhere: They are ready to go to the front lines at any time, and under the sacred banner of defending the great motherland, they will fight to the end against aggression, safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, and defend peace in the Far East and the world. Liu Zhongliang, deputy political commissar of the RenShou County Military Service Bureau in Sichuan Province, said that after rifle shooting, the excellence rate of our county's militia has reached more than 90%. Now field regiments, battalions, and companies have been established, waiting for the motherland's order. Within three hours, we can gather 100,000 militia to be deployed to fight the American aggressors.

    解放军陆海空三军将士不准美国强盗横行
    要求开赴前线痛击侵略者
    新华社23日讯　一昼夜之间，新的反侵略怒火在中国人民解放军各兵种部队势如燎原地再次燃烧起来，陆、海、空三军将士在无数次集会上，同声拥护陈毅外长的庄严声明，一致决心一定要收复金门、马祖，一定要解放台湾，誓为祖国的主权和领土完整战斗到底。他们并且愤怒警告美国侵略者，如果不立即缩回魔掌，滚出台湾，继续为非作歹，在“太岁头上动土”，那末双倍沉重的毁灭性的回击在等待着它们！
    早已枕戈待命的驻守在东南沿海的陆、海、空军部队，21日举行的多次集会上，一致表示：金门、马祖和台湾是我们身上的肉，蒋介石卖国集团是我们身上的刺，我们决不容许美帝国主义阻挠我们拔掉身上的刺，如果它还执迷不悟继续阻挠我们拔刺，我们有足够力量叫它和蒋介石集团一起消灭。18日击伤美制蒋机一架的飞行员韩玉砚说：我们解放金门、马祖和台湾的决心比钢还要坚，比玉还要硬，为了祖国的主权和领土的完整，抛头颅，洒热血，我在所不惜！
    北京、南京、上海、济南等地区部队广大官兵对杜勒斯在联合国大会上的无耻谰言，莫不怒火冲天，愤慨万分。李益亭上校说，颠倒黑白、混淆是非是侵略者的惯技。杜勒斯再叫嚣，真理正义永远不能改变，台湾还是中国的领土。在解放战争中，被评为三级战斗英雄的孟宪章愤怒地说，现在中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争是同蒋介石卖国军队打了多年内战的继续，和美国有什么关系？而侵占我国领土台湾的美国国务卿杜勒斯却倒栽一耙，反过来污蔑我们是“侵略”。这是强盗逻辑。我们要警告杜勒斯，我们是懂得怎样对付强盗的。
    广州、武汉、成都、昆明、郑州等地区驻军官兵都以抑制不住的激怒心情，纷纷呈递决心书，要求开赴前线迎头痛击侵略者。他们说，中国人民从来没有对战争威胁屈服过，为了反对日本帝国主义的侵略，中国人民曾经发动了全民性的抗战，并且取得了最后的胜利，如果美帝国主义有眼无珠，坚持要对我们进行侵略战争，那末，一个比日本帝国主义更加悲惨的失败命运在等待着它们。广州部队某部战士李慈满说，美国侵略者如不趁早从台湾地区滚出去，我们就拉紧绞索，把它绞死。正在进行空中和海上训练的空军某部和海军某校官兵表示，我们已作好准备，随时等候祖国命令，把侵略我国领土的美国强盗赶跑。正在祖国南方大修铁路的铁道兵部队官兵，决心加速闽滇大干线的建设，支援兄弟部队早日解放金门、马祖，解放台湾。
    各部队协助各地训练民兵的广大军官，纷纷和各地民兵一起向祖国宣誓：随时准备开上前线，在保卫伟大祖国的神圣旗帜下，为反抗侵略、维护祖国的主权和领土完整、保卫远东和世界和平战斗到底。四川省仁寿县兵役局副政委刘忠良说，我们全县民兵经过步枪射击，优秀率达到90％以上，现在野战团、营、连都已建立起来，只等待祖国一声令下，三小时内我们就可以集合十万民兵听候调配，去和美国侵略者作战。
