Agricultural sector estimates:
　　Soybeans - 25% increase compared to last year. Sesame - 124% increase compared to last year.
　　Peanuts - 138% increase compared to last year. Sunflowers - 214.3% increase compared to last year.

　　(This newspaper reports) Following the bumper harvest of rapeseed, the nation's peanuts, sesame, sunflowers, soybeans, and other oil crops are also generally growing well, showing a scene of abundant harvest.
　　According to the recent situation in various places, the Ministry of Agriculture initially estimates that the national soybean planting area is over 140 million mu, a decrease of over 40 million mu compared to last year. However, due to the strengthening of field management and increased fertilization by the vast number of farmers, soybeans are generally growing robustly. It is estimated that the unit area yield can reach 172 jin, and the total output can reach over 25 billion jin, an increase of 25% compared to last year.
　　"Satellites" are constantly appearing in the harvested soybeans. Guangming No. 2 Cooperative in Linyi County, Shandong Province, has 27 mu of soybeans with an average yield of 4,517 jin per mu, setting a high-yield record. It is estimated that over 80,000 mu of spring soybeans in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, can yield 1,000 jin per mu. According to statistics from eight counties in Kaifeng Prefecture, Henan Province, 46,600 mu of soybeans will yield over 2,000 jin per mu.
　　This year, peanut growth is better than in any previous year. It is estimated that the average yield per mu of the nation's more than 36 million mu of peanuts will reach about 334 jin, an increase of 133.4% compared to last year. The total output can reach over 120 million dan, exceeding the national plan by 70.5%, an increase of 138% compared to last year, and an increase of 93% compared to the highest annual output before liberation. It is estimated that the yield per mu in Henan Province can reach 500 jin, an increase of 3.7 times compared to last year. In the early harvest areas of peanuts in the south, such as Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi, many "satellites" have already been launched. Four counties in Fujian, including Nan'an and Jinjiang, have launched ten "satellites" with yields of over 10,000 jin. Jili Cooperative in Jinjiang launched a high-yield "satellite" with a yield of 26,968 jin per mu. In areas where peanuts mature later, efforts are now being made to seize the last opportunity, actively weed, prevent pests and diseases, and carry out soil cultivation. Last year's national peanut bumper harvest champion county, Hongan County, Hubei Province, has more than 47,000 mu of peanuts this year, with an average yield of 1,600 jin per mu, striving to become a double-thousand-jin county. The fruit setting rate of peanuts in this county has been greatly improved this year. Last year, each mound generally produced 40 to 60 fruits, and the most produced only 327 fruits, while this year each mound generally produces about 100 fruits, and a mound with 1,266 fruits has been discovered.
　　The planting area of sesame is about 13 million mu, slightly smaller than last year; but it is also generally growing well at present. It is estimated that the national average yield per unit area can reach 101 jin, and the total output can reach more than 13.9 million dan, an increase of 124% compared to last year. It is estimated that the average yield per mu of the more than 47,000 mu of sesame in Honghu County, Hubei Province, can reach more than 400 jin. Sesame in Xiaofan Township, Xiangyang County, has been harvested. The average yield per mu of 1,900 mu of sesame in the township is 1,150 jin, with 225 mu reaching more than 2,000 jin, 30 mu reaching more than 2,500 jin, and 10 mu reaching more than 3,000 jin. The tallest sesame plant is more than 9 chi tall, the stalk is as thick as a teacup, and each plant has 445 capsules.
　　According to incomplete statistics from eleven provinces and regions, a total of more than 2.95 million mu of sunflowers were planted this year, an increase of nearly one time compared to last year. It is estimated that the average yield per unit area will reach about 130 jin, and the total output will reach 3.83 million dan, an increase of 214.3% compared to last year. It is estimated that the yield per mu in Shanxi Province will be 200 jin. The 52,000 mu of sunflowers planted in Dingxiang County, the province this year, are expected to yield more than 400 jin per mu. The county is currently strengthening late-stage management and striving to reach 600 jin.
　　However, there are still problems in oil production. As far as soybeans are concerned, they have not yet shed the hat of low yield and have not yet broken through the 200-jin mark. Although the increase in production is considerable, it is somewhat inferior compared to other crops. It is necessary to step up efforts in this regard, especially in the Northeast, which is famous for soybeans, to make even greater efforts to become the national champion.
　　The increase in sesame production is also uneven. If the sesame in all regions is the same as in Honghu, Hubei, then it will be possible to remove the low-yield hat for sesame.

### 油料作物争上游

    油料作物争上游
    农业部门估计
    大豆——比去年增产25％  芝麻——比去年增产124％
    花生——比去年增产138％ 向日葵——比去年增产214.3％
    本报讯  今年继油菜丰收之后，全国的花生、芝麻、向日葵、大豆等油料作物也普遍生长良好，呈现丰收景象。
    农业部根据最近各地情况初步估计：全国大豆种植面积为一亿四千多万亩，比去年减少四千多万亩，但由于广大农民加强了田间管理和增加了施肥量，大豆普遍生长茁壮，预计单位面积产量可达一百七十二斤，总产量可达二百五十多亿斤，比去年增产25％。
    已经收获的大豆，“卫星”不断出现。山东临沂县光明二社有二十七亩大豆，平均亩产四千五百十七斤，创造了高产纪录。山东省寿张县八万多亩春大豆预计亩产可达千斤。河南省开封专区八个县统计，四万六千六百亩大豆，将可亩产二千斤以上。
    花生的生长情况今年比以往任何一年都好。全国三千六百多万亩花生，预计平均亩产达三百三十四斤左右，比去年提高133.4％，总产量可达一亿二千多万担，超过国家计划70.5％，比去年增产138％，比解放前最高年产量还增加93％。河南省预计亩产可达五百斤，比去年提高三点七倍。在南方的福建、广东、广西等花生早收地区，已经放出不少“卫星”。福建南安、晋江等四县已经放出十个万斤以上的“卫星”。晋江集力社放出了亩产二万六千九百六十八斤的高产“卫星”。在花生成熟较晚地区，现正抓紧最后时机，积极除草，防治虫害及进行培土等工作。去年全国花生丰产冠军县湖北红安县，今年全县四万七千多亩花生，平均亩产可到一千六百斤，力争实现双千斤县。这个县今年的花生结实率大大提高，去年一般每墩结果四十至六十个，最多的一墩才结果三百二十七个，而今年一般每墩都结果一百个左右，已经发现有一墩花生结果达一千二百六十六个。
    芝麻的种植面积，约为一千三百多万亩，比去年略有缩小；但目前也普遍生长良好，预计全国平均单产可达一百零一斤，总产量可达一千三百九十多万担，比去年增产124％。湖北洪湖县四万七千多亩芝麻，预计平均亩产可达四百斤以上。襄阳县小樊乡芝麻已经收割，全乡一千九百亩芝麻，平均亩产一千一百五十斤，并有二百二十五亩达二千斤以上，三十亩达二千五百斤以上，十亩达三千斤以上。最高的芝麻株高九尺多，秸粗如茶杯，每株有四百四十五个蒴果。
    根据十一个省区的不完全统计，今年共种植向日葵二百九十五万多亩，比去年扩种接近一倍。单位面积产量预计平均达一百三十斤左右，总产量可达三百八十三万担，比去年增产214.3％。山西省预计亩产二百斤。该省定襄县今年种植的五万二千亩向日葵，预计亩产达四百斤以上，现正在加强后期管理，争取达到六百斤。
    但是，油料生产还存在问题。就大豆来说，目前尚未脱掉低产帽子，尚未突破二百斤大关。虽然增产已不少，和其他作物比较，那就有些逊色。必须在这一方面加油，特别是以大豆出名的东北，更应大大加油，争取成为全国之冠。
    芝麻增产情况也不平衡。如果各地芝麻都和湖北洪湖一样，那就能替芝麻摘掉低产帽子了。
