Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: Responding to the call of the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the people of the Northwest and Southwest provinces and autonomous regions are launching a new high tide of steel production by the whole Party and the entire people.

Currently, Shaanxi Province has built eighteen steelmaking furnaces, and a large number of converters are being manufactured and installed at an accelerated pace. Workers in more than twenty machinery factories are fighting day and night to rush-produce rolling mills for the newly built Xi'an Steel Plant. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC recently held a telephone conference of prefectural and county Party committee secretaries, demanding that Party committees at all levels grasp steel production and quickly launch a new high tide in the development of the steel industry.

The CPC Gansu Provincial Committee and the Qinghai Provincial Committee have successively held meetings to deploy steel production. Lanzhou City in Gansu Province has decided to seize every second to accelerate steelmaking, ensuring that the city's 100,000-ton steelmaking task for this year is completed without fail.

The heads of the CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee and the city, county, and commune Party committees have all personally gone to the steel front lines, and more than 28,000 people in the province have gone to blast furnaces and mines to start the battle. At present, all seventy self-made 3-cubic-meter and 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces in the province have been completed and will soon be transported to various places.

Zeng Di, Secretary of the CPC Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee, personally oversaw the expansion project and production of Xinjiang's main steel enterprise – the August 1st Steel Plant. In order to build a 28-cubic-meter small blast furnace and thirty indigenous blast furnaces within this month, the plant now has hundreds of workers working hard every night under the illumination of searchlights. Tens of thousands of cadres, workers, and peasants throughout the autonomous region have entered the mining areas of the Tianshan and Altai Mountains to start mining and on-site smelting.

The indigenous iron smelting furnaces put into production in the Ningxia region have already produced more than 100 tons of pig iron. At present, the production of mining, coking, and refractory materials is being fully launched, and each county has mobilized two to three thousand people to go to the mountains to mine. The entire region has taken out more than 500 horsepower of power machinery and transferred more than 30 diesel engines from other places for iron smelting.

The CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee recently held a telephone conference to deploy steel production, resolutely ensuring the overfulfillment of the province's steel production tasks for this year. The municipal and prefectural Party committees have issued battle orders, guaranteeing that 10,000 indigenous blast furnaces and 400 hot-blast furnaces will be fully built and put into production before September 20th. At present, the labor force directly engaged in steel production throughout the province has exceeded 1.5 million people. Chongqing City has more than 400,000 people involved in the steel front. Steel mills, machinery factories, coal mines, power plants, textile factories, etc., are all building a large number of converters to accelerate steel production. On the transportation lines throughout the province, trains, automobiles, and wooden boats are also transporting pig iron day and night to support Chongqing and Chengdu.

The CPC Yunnan Provincial Committee held a telephone conference on the evening of the 1st. The Provincial Committee proposed that in steel production, leadership over small blast furnace groups must be grasped tightly. In machinery manufacturing, the experience of using small machines to make large machines must be promoted, the manufacturing of machine tools must be universally developed to arm ourselves, and the allocation of raw iron must be subject to unified planning. In copper smelting, a complete set of experience from furnace construction to smelting must be summarized in September, and copper production should be carried out on a large scale from October to ensure the completion of national plans.

In order to ensure the normal production of the built blast furnaces, the Party committee secretaries in various parts of Yunnan Province have personally gone to the side of the furnaces, combining with technicians and workers to specifically solve various difficulties in production. It is expected that pig iron production will increase significantly in September.

The CPC Guizhou Provincial Committee has determined that the province, special districts (autonomous prefectures), and counties must all establish production bases. The Provincial Committee recently organized technical guidance groups to go to various special districts (autonomous prefectures) and counties to provide on-site guidance. All machinery factories should adopt comprehensive collaboration methods to manufacture complete sets of smelting equipment. It is expected that by the end of September, three sets of medium-sized iron and steel complex equipment, ten sets of converters with an annual output of 10,000 tons of steel, and fifty-two sets of small converters with an annual output of 6,000 tons of steel can be produced.

　　日夜奋战　钢水奔流
    西北西南地区千军万马上阵
    据新华社5日讯　西北西南各省和自治区的人民响应中共中央政治局扩大会议的号召，正掀起一个全党全民大搞钢铁生产的新高潮。
    目前，陕西省已建成十八座炼钢炉，还有大批转炉正在加紧制造和安装。二十多个机械厂的工人正在日夜奋战，为新建的西安钢厂赶制轧钢机。中共陕西省委最近召开了地委、县委书记电话会议，要求各级党委抓钢铁生产，迅速掀起发展钢铁工业的新高潮。
    中共甘肃省委和青海省委相继召开了会议，部署钢铁生产。甘肃兰州市决定分秒必争，加速炼钢，使今年全市十万吨炼钢任务，一吨不少地完成。
    青海省委和市、县、乡、人民公社党委负责人，都已亲临钢铁前线，全省已有二万八千多人齐赴高炉、矿山展开战斗。目前省内自制的七十座三立方公尺和十三立方公尺的高炉已全部制成，即将运往各地。
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会书记曾涤亲自抓了新疆钢铁的大头——八一钢铁厂的扩建工程和生产。这个厂为了在本月内建成一座二十八立方公尺的小高炉和三十座土高炉，现在每天晚上都有几百个工人在探照灯照明下彻夜苦战。全自治区已有几万名干部、工人、农民走进了天山、阿尔泰山的矿区开始采矿和就地冶炼。
    宁夏地区投入生产的土炼铁炉已炼出生铁一百多吨。目前采矿、炼焦、耐火材料的生产都在全面铺开，各县发动了两三千人上山采矿。全区已拿出五百多马力的动力机械，从外地调来三十多台柴油机，供炼铁用。
    中共四川省委不久前召开电话会议，部署了钢铁生产，坚决保证超额完成今年全省的钢铁生产任务。各市委、地委发出了战斗令，保证9月20日以前万座土高炉和四百座热风高炉全部建成，随即投入生产。现在，全省直接投入钢铁生产的劳动大军已超过一百五十万人。重庆市已有四十多万人投入钢铁战线。各钢铁厂、机械厂、煤矿、发电厂、纺织厂等，都在兴建大批转炉，加速钢铁生产。在全省的交通线上，火车、汽车、木船也在日夜兼程运输生铁，支援重庆、成都。
    中共云南省委1日晚上召开了电话会议，省委提出在钢铁生产上，必须抓紧对小高炉群的领导，机械制造上，必须推广用小机器造大机器的经验，普遍发展机床制造，自己武装自己，原铁的调度必须服从统一的计划，在炼铜方面，9月份要总结出从建炉到冶炼的整套经验，从10月份起大干铜的生产，保证国家计划的完成。
    为了保证已建高炉的正常生产，云南省各地党委书记都亲自深入炉边，与技术员、工人结合，具体解决生产上的各种困难，预计9月份生铁产量将大为增加。
    中共贵州省委确定省、专区（州）、县都要建立起生产基地，省委最近组织技术辅导团，分赴各专区（州）和县，进行现场辅导。各机械厂要采取全面协作的办法，制造成套的冶炼设备，预计到9月底可生产出三套中型钢铁联合厂的设备、十套年产一万吨钢的转炉和五十二套年产六千吨钢的小型转炉。
