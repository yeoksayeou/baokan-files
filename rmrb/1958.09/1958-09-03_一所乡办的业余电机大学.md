　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The General Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Xutang Township, Jiande County, Zhejiang Province, established a spare-time electrical engineering university in response to the urgent need for technical personnel for electrification in the township. The twenty-five students studying are all young farmers.

　　The teaching characteristic of this electrical engineering university is the "integration of theory and practice, integration of learning and production, and integration of factory operation and education." Students attend classes in the classroom while engaging in actual production operations at the rice mill. The curriculum includes: political classes, professional knowledge classes (electrical engineering and mechanical engineering), and cultural classes. Teaching methods include lectures, self-study, practical training, and discussions.

　　In the six months since its establishment, this spare-time electrical engineering university has conducted eighteen professional knowledge classes and held ten production practice sessions.

　　一所乡办的业余电机大学
    据新华社讯　中共浙江省建德县绪塘乡总支根据本乡电气化迫切需要技术人材的情况，创办了一所业余电机大学。来学习的二十五个学生，都是青年农民。
    这个电机大学教学的特点是“理论与实际相结合、学习与生产相结合、办厂与办学相结合”。学生们一面在课堂内听课，一面在碾米厂进行实际生产操作。课程的内容是：政治课、专业知识课（电学和机械两门）和文化课。教学方法采取讲课、自学、实习和讨论。
    这所业余电机大学创办半年来，已上过十八次专业知识课，举行了十次生产实习。
