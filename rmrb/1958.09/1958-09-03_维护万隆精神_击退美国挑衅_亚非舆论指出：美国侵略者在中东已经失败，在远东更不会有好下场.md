Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Asian and African public opinion continues to condemn the provocative activities of the United States in the Far East. Many political figures and newspapers have pointed out that the people of Asia and Africa and the world's forces for peace once inflicted a shameful defeat on the American aggressors in the Middle East, and will inflict the same fate on the American aggressors in the Far East.

Indonesia
    Jakarta "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 2nd, strongly condemning the new provocative activities of the United States in the Taiwan Strait.

    The commentary pointed out that the result of this provocative activity by the United States is precisely the opposite of its wishes, because now is no longer the time when the Korean War had just begun, when the United States could deceive some countries. Many countries, especially Asian and African countries, have now seen through the sinister intentions of the United States. At the same time, the strength of China and the entire peace camp has become much stronger than before.

    The newspaper pointed out that Jinmen and other islands still occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek clique will inevitably return to their legitimate owner—the 600 million Chinese people. The commentary said that if China liberates Jinmen and Mazu, and turns this war base that threatens peace into a peaceful area for China to develop trade with other Asian countries, then Asian and African countries will not only not oppose it, but on the contrary, they will sincerely congratulate the resolution of the issue that has been threatening peace in the region.

    The commentary concluded that Indonesia, due to the issue of liberating West Irian, particularly believes that the liberation of Jinmen and Mazu islands is China's internal affair, and no one has the right to interfere.

Pakistan
    The chairman of the Pakistan National People's Party, Maulana Bhashani, who is currently on a friendly visit to the Republic of Iraq, said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 2nd regarding the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait, "Now is the time for the forces of peace to issue a strong call and not allow American imperialism to use force arbitrarily in the Pacific."

    He pointed out, "Now the people of the world, especially the people and governments of Asian and African countries, need to issue strong protests again against the United States' provocative activities and conspiracies in East Asia, and force the United States to withdraw its Seventh Fleet from the Taiwan Strait, because the Seventh Fleet is now directly encouraging Chiang Kai-shek on the waters of Taiwan."

    Bhashani expressed strong opposition to the Chiang Kai-shek clique occupying China's seat in the United Nations. He said, "The sooner this corpse is buried, the more beneficial it will be to peace-loving humanity."

Lebanon
    Nasib Nemer, editor-in-chief of the Lebanese "News," published an article in the Lebanese "Orient Daily" on the 1st, saying: "We hope that our friends—who supported us in the days when we were severely tested, the People's China, who gained liberation before all Eastern nations after the Great October Revolution opened the way for the liberation of all mankind—will achieve complete victory in the struggle to liberate Jinmen Island, Taiwan, and all the islands occupied by the American Seventh Fleet."

    Nemer wrote in this article entitled "The Rights of the People's China to Taiwan": "I don't know what right the United States has to 'defend' Taiwan Island, which has always been Chinese territory? I also don't know why Eisenhower dares to shamelessly announce that the United States will insist on preventing the People's China from annexing a part of its own territory to the mainland."

    Nemer said: "We Arabs in the Middle East have suffered, and are still suffering, from the atrocities of the Americans and the pain of American occupation." He said: "Any success achieved by China is a victory over its enemies, and this is also a victory that we can achieve in opposing our enemies."

United Arab Republic
    Cairo "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 1st, once again condemning the United States for interfering in China's internal affairs.

    The newspaper said: China's rights are as clear as daylight. Taiwan and the coastal islands, usurped by Chiang Kai-shek, are an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China. The whole issue is of an indisputable internal nature. The United States is interfering and provoking, interfering in matters that have nothing to do with it, thereby causing consequences that may threaten the peace and security of the entire world.

    The newspaper emphasized that there will be no peace in the Middle East unless the United States and Britain withdraw their occupying forces from the Middle East; there will be no peace in the Far East unless the United States abandons its hostile policy towards China and recognizes China's indisputable right to liberate the constituent parts of its territory.

　　维护万隆精神　击退美国挑衅
    亚非舆论指出：美国侵略者在中东已经失败，在远东更不会有好下场
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：亚非各国舆论继续谴责美国在远东的挑衅活动。很多政界人士和报纸指出，亚非人民和世界和平力量曾经在中东使美国侵略者遭到可耻的失败，同样也将在远东使美国侵略者遭到同样的下场。
　　印度尼西亚
    雅加达“人民日报”2日发表评论，严厉谴责美国在台湾海峡进行新的挑衅活动。
    评论指出，美国的这一挑衅活动的结果恰恰同它的意愿相反，因为现在已经不是朝鲜战争刚开始时的年头，那时美国还可以欺骗某些国家。许多国家，特别是亚非国家现在已经看清了美国的阴险意图。同时，中国和整个和平阵营的力量已经比以前强大得多。
    这家报纸指出，现在仍然由蒋介石集团占据的金门和其他岛屿必然要回到它们合法的主人——六亿中国人民——的手里。评论说，如果中国解放金门和马祖，并且把这个威胁和平的战争基地变成为中国同其他亚洲国家发展贸易的和平地区，那么，亚非国家不仅不反对，相反的它们将衷心祝贺一直威胁着这个地区的和平的问题得到解决。
    评论最后说，印度尼西亚由于有着解放西伊里安的问题，因此特别认为解放金门和马祖等岛屿是中国的内政问题，谁也无权干涉。
　　巴基斯坦
    正在伊拉克共和国进行友好访问的巴基斯坦民族人民党主席大毛拉巴沙尼2日在单独接见新华社记者时就台湾海峡紧张局势发表谈话说，“现在是和平力量发出强大的呼声、不让美帝国主义在太平洋肆意使用武力的时候了。”
    他指出，“现在再次需要世界人民、尤其是亚非各国人民和政府发出强有力的抗议，反对美国在东亚的挑衅活动和阴谋，并且迫使美国从台湾海峡撤出它的第七舰队，因为第七舰队现在在台湾海面上直接鼓励着蒋介石。”
    巴沙尼表示强烈反对蒋介石集团分子窃据联合国中的中国席位。他说，“这具僵尸埋葬得越快，对爱好和平的人类就越有利。”
　　黎巴嫩
    黎巴嫩“消息报”主编纳西布·尼默尔1日在黎巴嫩“东方报”上发表的一篇文章说：“我们希望我们的朋友——在我们受到严重考验的日子里给我们以支持的、在伟大的十月革命为全人类的解放开辟了道路以后先于所有东方民族获得解放的人民中国——在解放金门岛、台湾以及所有在美国第七舰队占领下的岛屿的斗争中获得完全胜利。”
    尼默尔在这篇以“人民中国对台湾的权利”为题的文章中写道：“我不知道美国有什么权利‘保卫’一向就是中国的领土的台湾岛？我也不知道艾森豪威尔为什么胆敢厚颜无耻地宣布，美国要坚持阻止人民中国把它自己的领土的一部分归并于大陆。”
    尼默尔说：“我们中东的阿拉伯人曾经遭受过，而且现在还在遭受着美国人的暴行和美国占领的痛苦。”他说：“中国所取得的任何成功都是它反对它的敌人的胜利，这也是我们在反对我们的敌人时所可能取得的胜利。”
　　阿联
    开罗“人民报”1日发表社论，再次谴责美国干涉中国内政。
    这家报纸说：中国的权利像白昼一样清楚，台湾和沿海岛屿是被蒋介石篡夺的，是中华人民共和国的不可分割的一部分。整个问题是无可争辩的内政性质的。美国进行干涉和挑衅，是在干涉同它毫不相干的事情，从而引起可能威胁整个世界和平和安全的后果。
    报纸强调说，如果美国和英国不从中东撤退它们的占领军，中东就不会有和平；在远东也不会有和平，除非美国放弃它敌视中国的政策，承认中国解放它的领土的组成部分的无可争辩的权利。
