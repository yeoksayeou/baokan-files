	"A New Force" on the Autumn Harvest Front
	National Agricultural Implement Exhibition Displays a Batch of New Autumn Harvest Tools

	(Our report) The National Agricultural Implement Exhibition has recently displayed a new batch of autumn harvest tools. These tools include rapid harvesters urgently needed in autumn harvests across the country, high-efficiency slicing machines, universal threshing machines, and more. They were all created based on the new situation of rapidly increasing per-unit-area yields in agricultural production this year.
	Among these new exhibits is the Qinggu Threshing and Combining Machine from Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province. It only requires two people to pedal the machine to sequentially perform the processes of threshing, sieving, cleaning, and bagging, with the same functions as a mechanically driven large-scale thresher. This small machine is modified based on the principle of the old-fashioned rice-bundling machine. Three people operating it can thresh six to seven mu of rice per day. At the same time, it is also suitable for threshing crops such as wheat, barley, and rapeseed. This machine is made of wood, small and light, and very easy to move. When transportation resources are insufficient during the busy farming season, it can also be moved to the fields for use.
	A simple, lightweight, and efficient folding rice thresher manufactured by the Yulin County Manufacturing Plant in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region can be used in the fields. When folded, it looks like a wooden box, and one person can carry it to the field. If four people operate it, it can thresh 700 catties of rice per hour, which is ten times more efficient than manual labor.
	The foot-operated universal processing machine in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is specially designed for slicing, shredding, grinding, and vine cutting of various tubers. It can also be used for corn threshing. One person operating it can slice more than 8,200 catties in a day. If shredding, it can shred 5,200 catties, and grinding can produce 2,000 catties of sweet potato flour in a day. Sweet potato flour sieving and bagging are also automated.
	After the high-density planting of rice, what tools should be used for harvesting? Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan, and other provinces have already created more than a dozen similar rapid rice harvesters, made of wood and bamboo. This type of harvester can harvest regardless of the density of planting, with high efficiency and less scattering. The most efficient is the four-row rapid harvester from Zhejiang Province, which can harvest 30 mu of paddy fields per day by one person. The rapid harvester in Hunan also has a support rod, which can harvest lodged rice cleanly. These wooden and bamboo rapid harvesters are all pushed or pulled by hand by one person and can not only harvest rice but also harvest beans, corn, and sorghum.
	With the development of the agricultural implement reform movement across the country, newly created agricultural implements are constantly emerging. The National Agricultural Implement Exhibition is collecting samples of the latest created agricultural implements to promote better agricultural implements to all parts of the country. Various provinces are also rapidly transporting newly created agricultural implements to Beijing as a gift to the National Day.

### 秋收战线上的“生力军”  全国农具展览会展出一批新的秋收农具

    秋收战线上的“生力军”
    全国农具展览会展出一批新的秋收农具
    本报讯　全国农具展览会最近又展出一批新的秋收农具。这些农具有各地秋收当中迫切需要的快速收割器、效率高的切片机、万能打谷机等。它们都是根据今年农业生产单位面积产量迅速提高的新情况创造的。
    这些新展品中有江苏省奉贤县的清谷脱粒联合机，它只要两个人踏动机器，就可依次进行脱粒、过筛、清选和灌袋几道工序，和机械带动的大型脱谷机的工能一样。这部小机器是根据旧式扎稻机的原理改制的，三个人操作，每天可以打稻谷六、七亩。同时它也适用于小麦、大麦、菜籽等作物的脱粒。这部机器是木制的，体积又小又轻，移动非常方便，在农忙运输力量不足时，还可以搬到田里使用。
    广西僮族自治区玉林县制造厂制的一种简单、轻便、效率高的折叠式打稻机，可以在田里使用，它折叠后像一个木箱，一个人扛着就可以下地，如果四个人操作，每小时就可以脱谷七百市斤，比人工效率高十倍。
    广西僮族自治区的脚踏万能加工机，是专门供各种薯类切片、切丝、磨粉、切蔓，也可以用做玉米脱粒。一个人操作，一天就可以切片八千二百多斤，如果切丝就可以切五千二百斤，磨粉一天就能出二千斤薯粉，薯粉过筛、装袋也都是自动化的。
    水稻高度密植之后，用什么工具来收割？福建、浙江、湖南等省已经创造了十几种类似的水稻快速收割器。有木制的和竹制的。这种收割器不管怎样密植都可以收割，效率高、抛撒少。效率最高的是浙江省的四行的快速收割器，每天一个人可以收割三十亩稻田。湖南的快速收割器还带扶杆，能把倒伏的水稻割净，这些木制、竹制的快速收割器都是一个人用手推或手拉的，不仅能割水稻，也可以收割豆类、玉米和高粱。
    随着全国各地农具改革运动的发展，新创造的各种农具不断涌现，全国农具展览会正在征集最新创造的农具样品，以便向全国各地推广更好的农具，各省也正把新创造的农具迅速运来北京，做为向国庆节的献礼。
