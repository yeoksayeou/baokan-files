　　Relying on a Few Cadres Leads to Quietness;
    Mobilizing the Broad Masses Leads to a Vigorous Movement:
    Beigu Township, Suining, Gains Important Experience in Propaganda Work
    (Our Newspaper Correspondent Yu Zhangrui reports) Relying on a few cadres to carry out propaganda results in quietness, slowness, poor quality, and wastefulness; relying on the broad masses to carry out propaganda results in a vigorous movement, more, faster, better, and more economically. This is an important experience gained by the Party organization of Beigu Township, Suining County, Sichuan Province, in leading propaganda work.

    Before last winter, there was no consensus within the Party on how to carry out propaganda work. Some people opposed propaganda work to the central task, believing that doing propaganda and mobilization work would delay production. Xiong Quanxing, the Party branch secretary of the Third Cooperative, believed: "We are too busy with the great leap in production to handle it, how can we have time to do propaganda work? Let's do it when we have some free time." Some comrades mystified propaganda and mobilization work, believing that only intellectuals could do it. Li Ronghua (a Party member), the director of the Tenth Cooperative, said: "We can't find such talents in our cooperative, we can't do it. We need to send people who can write, paint, speak, and sing." Some people believed that only a few leading cadres could do propaganda work. Some people wanted to buy gongs, cosmetics, and stage large-scale dramas as soon as they opened their mouths. Under the guidance of this kind of thinking, propaganda work was divorced from the masses and divorced from production. As a result, there were many entertainment activities but few political mobilizations in the fields; many materials from other places but few local materials; many negative materials but few positive and active ones; much formalism but little effective action; many large-scale dramas but few short and concise ones; many dance programs but few storytelling and ballad materials. Propaganda activities were not popularized, diversified, regularized, or lively.

    After the emergence of the situation of the great leap forward in production in Beigu Township, the Party General Branch launched a debate among Party members and cadres on the two methods and two paths on the propaganda front. That is: should we fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses to carry out propaganda work under the direct leadership of the Party, or should a few people do it quietly? Is it more, faster, better, and more economical, or less, slower, poorer, and more wasteful? Many vivid facts have proved that boldly letting go of the masses and relying on the masses can make propaganda work vigorous and colorful, and can truly play its role in inspiring the masses, promoting production, and driving work forward. After clarifying the direction of propaganda work through debate, propaganda work in Beigu Township was carried out vigorously, and a lively and colorful new situation also emerged.

    The propaganda forms in Beigu Township are diverse. They include slogans, mobilization placards, jingles, sending couplets, sending good news, broadcasting, blackboards, and calling out numbers, playing the money board, and so on. Propaganda work is rapid and timely. The propaganda content is accurate, combative, and combined with production and thought. Propaganda materials are self-written and self-compiled by the masses, inexhaustible. Whether in water conservancy construction or production, many inspiring slogans and quick verse have emerged. Such as "If the mountain does not bow its head, people will not leave; if the river does not give way, the soldiers will not withdraw." "Seize the time as if seizing treasure, everyone exert effort, strive for a thousand catties of rice, life will be better!" There are criticisms and praises in the mobilization placards. Liao Yunshan, the production team leader of the Seventh Team of the Pioneer General Cooperative, abandoned production leadership. The mobilization placard criticized him: "Production team leader Liao Yunshan, fishes in the river every day, the cooperative members can't find anything to do, thirteen played for most of the day." Helping Liao Yunshan quickly correct his shortcomings. Zhou Zongwu, a member of the Sixth Team of the Pioneer Second Cooperative, got up late at night to block water for irrigation, and persisted until dawn, irrigating fifteen acres of land, saving the cooperative fifty-two water-drawing workers, so the cooperative wrote a couplet on red paper and sent it to him. The first line is: "In order to yield a thousand catties per mu"; the second line is: "Therefore, guarding the water all night long." The horizontal inscription is: "Extraordinary Merit." Every day when Zhou Zongwu saw this couplet, he was full of energy. When teams and groups saw good or bad things in collective production activities, they promptly shouted to each other, singing jingles. For example, the wheat fields of the Second Team and the Third Team of the Pioneer Fourth Cooperative are connected. During the break, after the members of the Third Team struck the gong to start work, they were still smoking and talking. The members of the Second Team composed a jingle and collectively shouted to the Third Team: "The members of the Third Team, don't delay (meaning to procrastinate), you should start working when the gong rings! Hey! Hey! Start working! ..." After hearing this, the members of the Third Team quickly took action and composed a jingle to thank the members of the Second Team: "Thank you for the suggestions from the members of the Second Team, we have already started working! Hey! Hey! Already started working! ..."

　　依靠少数干部冷冷清清
    发动广大群众轰轰烈烈
    遂宁北固乡宣传工作取得重要经验
    本报讯　记者余章瑞报道：依靠少数干部进行宣传，结果是冷冷清清，少慢差费；依靠广大群众进行宣传，结果是轰轰烈烈，多快好省。这是四川省遂宁县北固乡党组织在领导宣传工作中取得的重要经验。
    在去年冬天以前，究竟怎样开展宣传工作，党内认识也不一致。有的把宣传工作同中心工作对立起来，认为作宣传鼓动工作就要耽误生产。三社党支书熊全兴就认为：“抓生产大跃进都搞不赢，那有时间抓宣传工作，等二天活路松点来抓吧。”有的同志把宣传鼓动工作神秘化，认为只有知识分子才能搞。十社主任李荣华（党员）说：“我们这个社找不到那种人材，搞不起来。要派些能写、能画、能说、能唱的人来才得行。”有的人认为只有少数领导干部才能作宣传工作。有些人一开口就要买锣、买化妆品、排大剧目。在这种思想指导下，宣传工作脱离群众，脱离生产。于是形成娱乐活动多，田间政治鼓动少；外地材料多，本地材料少；消极的多，正面积极的少；形式主义的多，发挥作用的少；大型剧目多，短小精干的少；舞蹈节目多，说唱材料少。宣传活动不大众化，不多样化，不经常化，也不生动活泼。
    北固乡在生产大跃进的形势出现后，党总支便在党员、干部中开展宣传战线上两种方法两条道路的争辩。即：是在党的直接领导下，充分发动群众、依靠群众开展宣传工作呢，还是由少数人在那里冷冷清清地搞呢？是多快好省呢，还是少慢差费？许多活生生的事实证明，大胆放手发动群众、依靠群众，宣传工作才能干得轰轰烈烈，有声有色，才能真正发挥它的鼓舞群众、促进生产、推动工作的作用。经过辩论，明确了宣传工作的方向以后，北固乡的宣传工作就轰轰烈烈地开展起来了，生动活泼、有声有色的新局面也随之出现。
    北固乡的宣传形式多种多样。计有标语口号、鼓动牌、拉拉词、送对联、送喜报、广播、黑板报以及喊号子、打金钱板等等。宣传工作迅速及时。宣传内容准确、富有战斗性，并结合生产、结合思想。宣传材料由群众自编、自写，取之不尽，用之不竭。无论在兴修水利或生产中都出现了许多富有鼓动性的标语口号和快板诗。如“山不低头人不走，河不让路兵不收”。“抢时如抢宝，大家展劲搞，争取千斤稻，生活更美好！”鼓动牌中有批评也有表扬。先锋总社第七队生产组长廖云山，放弃生产领导，鼓动牌上提出批评：“生产组长廖云山，每天捞鱼到河边，社员找不到事情干，十三耍了大半天。”帮助廖云山很快改正了缺点。先锋二社六队社员周宗武，深夜起来拦水灌田，一直坚持到天亮，灌了十五亩田，为社节省了五十二个车水工，社里便用红纸写了一付对联送给他。上联是：为了亩产千斤稻；下联是：因此保水守通宵。横额是：奇功异迹。周宗武每天一看到这付对联就浑身是劲。队与队、组与组在集体生产活动时，互相看到好的或不好的就及时向对方呼号，唱拉拉词。如先锋四社二队和三队的麦田相连，休息时，三队社员在打了上工锣以后还在抽烟、谈天，二队社员便编了拉拉词集体向三队呼号：“三队社员莫挨台（即拖延的意思），锣儿一响就该干起来！嘿！嘿！干起来！……”三队社员听了后，连忙行动起来，还编了一首拉拉词答谢二队社员：“感谢二队社员提意见，我们已经干起来！嘿！嘿！已经干起来！……”
