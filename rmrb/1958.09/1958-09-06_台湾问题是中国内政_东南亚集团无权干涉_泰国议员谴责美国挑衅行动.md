　　Taiwan Issue is China's Internal Affair; the Southeast Asia Group Has No Right to Interfere
    Thai Parliamentarian Condemns American Provocative Actions
    Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Bangkok News: Thai Socialist United Front parliamentarian Nai Phornchai Srisathat submitted an inquiry to the Thai Parliament on the 2nd, stating that the United States, under the pretext of "defending" Taiwan, dispatched a large number of warships and aircraft to the Taiwan Strait to conduct activities, openly provoking China. This is an interference in China's internal affairs and has already caused the situation in the Far East to become tense.
    Nai Phornchai requested the government to state its position on the provocative incidents created by the United States in the Taiwan Strait. He also questioned whether the government would take measures to prevent the United States from possibly dragging the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization into participating in interfering in other countries' internal affairs. He said that the Taiwan Strait incident is not within the scope of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's affairs.
    The Secretary-General of the National Socialist Party, Nai Phorn Phunnakarn, stated to the press on the same day that the Taiwan Strait issue is China's own affair.

　　台湾问题是中国内政东南亚集团无权干涉
    泰国议员谴责美国挑衅行动
    新华社4日讯　曼谷消息：泰国社会主义联合阵线议员乃蓬猜·盛察2日向泰国议会提出一项质询案指出，美国借口“保卫”台湾，派遣大批军舰、飞机到台湾海峡进行活动，公开向中国挑衅，这是干涉中国的内政，并且已经使远东局势趋向紧张。
    乃蓬猜要求政府表明对美国在台湾海峡制造挑衅事件的立场。他并且质问政府是否采取措施以防止美国可能拉扯东南亚条约组织参预干涉他人的内政。他说，台湾海峡的事件不是东南亚条约组织份内的事。
    国家社会党总书记乃蓬·本那干在同一天向报界发表谈话指出，台湾海峡的事情是中国自己的事。
