    Finding Shortcomings, Finding Problems
    Jiangsu's comprehensive review of the ball-bearing conversion of transport tools has two noteworthy points:

    First, it tells us that while correctly affirming achievements, we must not turn a blind eye to shortcomings. Especially in the work of installing ball bearings, which took place over a short period and yielded great results, some people are prone to complacency at this time, thinking that everything is fine and there is nothing to worry about. However, as long as everyone is mobilized in a guided way to conduct an in-depth inspection, it will be found that there are still some problems in the work, so that everyone can pay attention to solving the problems and continue to work hard to do the work better.

    Second, Jiangsu Province's method of mobilizing iron and wood workers to inspect, impart technology, and help the masses repair tools during the general survey is also very good. This not only ensures that tools that have been installed with ball bearings can be used, consolidating the achievements of the ball-bearing movement, but also, through this work, achieves the goal of passing on technology to the masses, thereby promoting the advancement of the movement.

### 查缺点，查问题

    查缺点，查问题
    江苏全面复查运转工具滚珠轴承化的情况，有两点值得注意：
    第一，它告诉我们在正确肯定成绩的时候，对缺点不可张目不见。特别像安装滚珠轴承工作，经历期间很短，而成绩很大，有些人在这个时候就容易自满起来，以为万事大吉，高枕无忧。但是，只要有领导地发动大家深入地检查一下，就会发现工作中多少还有一些问题，这样就能使大家注意解决问题，并且继续努力把工作做得更好。
    第二，江苏省在普查中发动铁木工人一边检查，一边传授技术，并帮助群众修整工具，也是很好的办法。这不仅能使既经安装上滚珠轴承的工具能使用起来，巩固滚珠轴承运动的成果，并且通过这个工作，还达到了把技术交给群众，从而推动运动前进的目的。
