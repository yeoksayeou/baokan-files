Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 24th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial on the 23rd entitled "The Crisis in the Taiwan Strait and the Road to Opening Japan-China Relations," pointing out that the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait is caused by the United States' blatant aggression against China, and this issue has become the central issue of international politics. The editorial said that Japan, because the Nobusuke Kishi government has adopted a policy of hostility toward China, is currently standing on the edge of the most dangerous war.

"Akahata" pointed out that the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued two emergency statements on September 3rd and 18th, calling on the Japanese people to pay attention to these facts: the United States has used the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to turn Japan into a partner in the U.S. military's aggression against China without the Japanese people's knowledge; U.S. military bases in Japan have become important strongholds for the U.S. military's aggression against China; U.S. troops stationed in Japan have gone to the Taiwan area to participate in war provocations; the Nobusuke Kishi government's policy of hostility toward China will drag Japan into the U.S.'s military provocations against China, and the Nobusuke Kishi government is attempting to use the crisis in the Taiwan Strait to promote Japan's militarization, which is Japan's blatant act of hostility toward China. "Akahata" pointed out that the fundamental problem currently facing the movement to open Japan-China relations is the above-mentioned problem, which Japan itself has created.

The editorial pointed out that since the crisis in the Taiwan Strait occurred, the Nobusuke Kishi government has gone against the wishes of the Japanese people and moved further in the direction of hostility toward China.

"Akahata" pointed out that in promoting the movement to open Japan-China relations, it is necessary to recognize these issues: Japan's subordination to the United States, and its failure to achieve complete independence to this day, is the fundamental reason why the Japanese government goes against the will of the people and is hostile to China; in order to step up the revival of Japanese militarism, the Nobusuke Kishi government not only hinders the development of Japan-China relations, but also attempts to make the Japanese people openly hostile to China.

The editorial believes that in the context of the Taiwan Strait crisis, the issue of opening Japan-China relations is the most important issue facing Japan today. If the movement is to be promoted in the future, it must first oppose the United States' aggression and the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to act as an accomplice to U.S. aggression, and at the same time launch a struggle to defend peace in the Far East. "Akahata" pointed out that through such practical actions, the unity between the Japanese people and the Chinese people, who are currently engaged in a just struggle to liberate their territory against aggression and to defend peace, can be strengthened, and this is the foundation of Japan-China friendship and amity. The editorial called on the Japanese people to oppose the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and all its policies of hostility toward China, and demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government sever all relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and abolish the "Japan-Chiang Treaty."

    日本“赤旗报”社论指出
    要推动打开日中关系运动  必须反对岸政府帮凶政策
    新华社24日讯  东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”23日发表的题为“台湾海峡的危机和打开日中关系的道路”的社论指出，台湾海峡紧张局势是由于美国公然对中国进行侵略而引起的，这个问题已经成为国际政治的中心问题。社论说，日本因为岸信介政府采取敌视中国的政策，目前已经站在最危险的战争的边缘。
    “赤旗报”指出，日本共产党中央委员会曾经在9月3日和18日两次发表紧急声明，唤起日本人民注意这些事实：美国已经利用日美“安全条约”在日本人民不知不觉之中把日本变成美军侵略中国的伙伴；日本的美军基地已经变成美军侵略中国的重要据点；在日本的美军开到台湾地区参加了战争挑衅；岸信介政府敌视中国的政策将使日本卷进美国对中国的军事挑衅中，岸信介政府企图利用台湾海峡的危机推进日本的军国主义化，这是日本公然敌视中国的行为。“赤旗报”指出，打开日中关系运动目前所面临的根本问题也就是上述的问题，这是日本自己制造出来的问题。
    社论指出，自从台湾海峡发生危机以来，岸信介政府同日本人民的愿望背道而驰，更加走向同中国敌对的方向。
    “赤旗报”指出，在推进打开日中关系的运动的时候，必需认清这些问题：日本从属于美国，至今尚未获得完全独立，这是使日本政府违背人民的意志敌视中国的根本原因；岸信介政府为了加紧复活日本军国主义，不仅阻碍日中关系的发展，而且还企图使日本人民公然敌视中国。
    社论认为，在台湾海峡危机的情况下，打开日中关系的问题是日本目前面临的最重要的问题，今后如果要推进运动，必须首先反对美国的侵略和岸信介政府充当美国侵略伙伴的阴谋，同时为保卫远东和平而展开斗争。“赤旗报”指出，通过这样的实际行动，才能加强日本人民同目前正在为反对侵略和保卫和平而解放自己的领土进行正义斗争的中国人民的团结，这才是日中友好和亲善的基础。社论号召日本人民反对岸信介政府企图制造“两个中国”的阴谋和它的一切敌视中国的政策，要求岸信介政府断绝同蒋介石集团的一切关系，废除“日蒋条约”。
