How to Protect Nylon Fabrics

With the development of the synthetic fiber industry, the number of daily necessities made of nylon is increasing. Here are some ways to protect nylon fabrics.

    I. To wash nylon fabrics, it is best to use a neutral soap solution dissolved in warm water, or cold soapy water. When washing, hold the garment in your hand and shake it in the soapy water a few times to remove dirt; especially dirty areas can be gently brushed with a brush. Do not use a washboard or rub vigorously. Oil stains on clothing can be cleaned with gasoline.

    II. Nylon fabrics do not absorb water and dry easily. Do not wring them out after washing. Gently shake off the water, smooth out the wrinkles, and hang them in a ventilated place to dry.

    III. Because nylon fabrics have been heat-treated, they do not wrinkle or lose shape after drying, so there is no need to starch or iron them.

    IV. Blended nylon fabrics should be stored in the same way as wool fabrics. Before storing, wash away any dirt, fold neatly, and place in a cool place; no moth repellent is needed, and they will not be eaten by moths.

    怎样保护尼龙织品
    随着合成纤维工业的发展，用尼龙制造的生活用品日益增多。这里，介绍一些保护尼龙织品的办法。
    一、洗尼龙织品，最好用温水溶解的中性肥皂液，或者用冷肥皂水洗。洗时用手提着衣物在肥皂水中摇晃几遍，就可以去掉污垢；特别脏的地方可以用刷子轻刷，切忌用洗衣板和用力揉洗。衣物上的油渍可以用汽油擦洗。
    二、尼龙织品不吸水，很容易干，洗后不要拧，轻轻把水震动掉，把皱折拉开，放在通风处晾一会就干。
    三、因为尼龙织品已加热处理过，干后不出折皱，也不走样，所以不用上浆，不用拿熨斗熨。
    四、混纺尼龙织品应按照保存毛织品方法保存。在保存前要洗去污垢，折叠好，放在阴凉处；不用防虫剂，也不会被虫蛀蚀。
