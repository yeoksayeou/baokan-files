A New Way to Produce More Coke
Dazhou Prefecture Promotes "Tube Kiln" Coking

(According to Sichuan Daily) Wanxin Iron Plant in Wanyuan County recently, based on the method of refining briquette charcoal and the principle of fierce fire coking, successfully experimented with coking using "tube kilns," creating a new landscape for coke production and powerfully promoting pig iron production. Currently, Dazhou Prefecture is promoting this new experience of quickly producing more coke.

Using "tube kilns" for coking has six major advantages: (1) Simple equipment. Level the fields, corners of the land, or courtyards, and build a wall panel 6.3 city feet wide and 3 city feet high (length is not limited). Open a firing door 4 city feet along the length (9 city feet high, 8 city feet wide, ash removal opening 1.5 city feet high), and install a hearth bridge to form a coke oven. The remaining tools include movable wooden square buckets, shovels, fire tongs, etc. The entire equipment only requires an investment of 40 yuan. (2) Simple operation technology, easier to operate than flat-box kilns and fire-pot kilns, and can be learned in one day. This coking method does not require setting up sticks, leaving fire eyes, or clearing fire paths. Just mix the crushed coal with 10%-14% moisture and add crushed coke (generally about 15%), and then use wooden buckets to build them up one by one. It is best to install stones or bricks of the same size as the wooden bucket under the tube briquettes. After building, cover the kiln with bricks and leave chimneys along the center line of the kiln, staggered from the firing door (about 8 city inches high and 4 city inches in diameter). Then use lump coal and firewood to start the fire. When flames come out of the chimney, immediately pull out the hearth bridge and close each firing door. When the flame shows an old red glow, you can extinguish the fire with water to release the coke. (3) Low breakage rate and high recovery rate. Because the raw coal is cylindrical, the coke is also round after being refined, making it convenient for kiln removal and transportation, with less damage. The recovery rate generally reaches about 60%, about 20% higher than fire-pot kilns and 10% higher than flat-box kilns. (4) Not selective about coal quality, low cost. (5) Short coking time and high work efficiency. Because each tube briquette has a fire channel, it can play a combustion-supporting role. Generally, coke can be formed in 10 to 15 hours, which is more than six days shorter than the carbonization time of flat-box kilns and more than two days shorter than fire-pot kilns. Due to the short carbonization time, production efficiency is greatly improved. (6) Most suitable for township and commune-run coke plants, and the technology can be learned quickly.

On September 5th, Dazhou Prefecture organized on-site observation at the entire prefecture's iron smelting on-site meeting held in Wanyuan County. Everyone thought it was very good and expressed their intention to promote it immediately after returning.

    多产焦的新门路
    达县专区推广“筒筒窑”炼焦
    据四川日报消息　万源县万新铁厂最近根据炼铧炭的方法和猛火炼焦的原理，试验用“筒筒窑”炼焦成功，使焦炭生产出现了一片新气象，有力地推动了生铁生产。目前，达县专区正在推广这种快产焦多产焦的新经验。
    用“筒筒窑”炼焦有六大好处：（1）设备简单。把田边、地角或院坝铲平，用墙板筑成宽六点三市尺，高三市尺（长度不限制），沿长度方向四尺处开一发火门（高九市尺，宽八市尺，掏灰口高一点五市尺），安上炉桥即成为焦窑。其余的工具有活动木质方桶、洋铲、火钳等，整个设备只需投资四十元。（2）操作技术简单，比平厢窑、火罐窑好操作，在一天内就可以学会。这种炼焦方法不用摆棒子、留火眼、通火路等，只将碎煤以10％—14％的水分拌匀，并加碎焦（比例一般在15％左右），然后用木桶依次装筑。筒筒炭底下最好安上与木桶一样大的石头或砖。筑好后，在窑上盖好砖，在沿窑中心线上与发火门错开留起烟囱（高八市寸左右，直径四市寸），然后用块煤、柴发火。当烟囱出火焰时，即将炉桥抓出将各发火门闭住。到火光呈老红色光芒，即可用水打火出焦。（3）破碎率少，回收率高。由于原煤是筒形，炼成焦后也是圆形，出窑、运输都很方便，破损少，回收率一般达到60％左右，比火罐窑约高20％，比平厢窑高10％。（4）不择煤质，成本低。（5）炼焦时间短，工效高。由于每筒炭都有火道，能起助燃作用，一般十至十五小时就能结成焦，比平厢窑炭化时间减少六天多，比火罐窑减少两天多。由于炭化时间短，生产效率大大提高。（6）最适合乡社办焦厂，技术很快就能学会。
    9月5日，达县专区在万源县召开的全专区炼铁现场会议上，组织了现场观摩。大家认为很好，表示回去要马上推广。
