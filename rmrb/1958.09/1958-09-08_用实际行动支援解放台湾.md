　　Use Practical Actions to Support the Liberation of Taiwan
　　Workshop as Battlefield, Tools as Weapons
　　Exceed Production Plans

    We, the entire workforce of the Machine Tool Factory of the Renmin University of China, resolutely support Premier Zhou's statement and are determined to crush the military provocations of the American aggressors with practical actions. We cannot tolerate the American imperialists creating tension in Taiwan and the Far East and undermining world peace. We resolutely warn the American aggressors: Taiwan must be liberated, and the American aggressors must get out. The Chinese people, with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, have the determination and the strength to crush aggression and defend peace!

    We are university students and also new workers. In the hard struggle of the past month and a half, we have manufactured four machine tools. Now we are entering the second phase of production. We take the workshop as the battlefield and the tools as weapons, to muster greater enthusiasm, and use our production achievements to support our country's socialist construction and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan. We unanimously stated: If the motherland issues a call, we will immediately put down our pens and tools, put on our military uniforms, pick up our guns, and rush to the front lines to wipe out the aggressors in the Taiwan Strait.
                        All workers of the Machine Tool Factory of Renmin University of China

    Taiwan is our country's territory, and we will never allow American imperialism to occupy Taiwan. We firmly declare: We must fight to the end to liberate Taiwan!

    Finally, we guarantee: When the motherland needs us, we will not hesitate to step forward and stand at the forefront of liberating Taiwan. In our production posts, we will work even harder. We will use the practical action of overfulfilling production tasks to support the liberation of Taiwan.
                Trial Production Group of the Fourth Workshop, Beijing Comprehensive Instrument Factory
                Ma Xiwen, Deng Hu, Li Yuanhua, Han Baosen, and 19 others

    (Editor's note: All the workers of the Beijing Comprehensive Instrument Factory enthusiastically support Premier Zhou's statement on the Taiwan Strait situation and have sent more than one hundred and ten letters of protest against the American imperialist occupation of Taiwan and resolutions of support for the liberation of Taiwan to the editorial department.)

    After listening to Premier Zhou's statement, more than 600 employees of the Tool Workshop unanimously supported it and expressed great anger at the shameless act of aggression by American imperialism. They immediately organized discussions and unanimously stated: They will protest Dulles' shameless statement with the practical action of going all out to complete the production leap forward targets ahead of schedule, and be a hundred times more vigilant, ready at all times to respond to the call of the motherland, and resolutely liberate our territory of Taiwan.
  　All employees of the Tool Workshop, Beijing State-Owned Wire Factory

    Do a good job in agricultural production
　　Guarantee a bumper autumn harvest

    We fully support Premier Zhou's solemn statement, resolutely oppose American imperialism's use of force to interfere in our country's internal affairs, and oppose American imperialism's occupation of our country's territory of Taiwan.

    Taiwan is our country's sacred territory, and we must liberate Taiwan. We have the right and the strength to liberate our Taiwan compatriots from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, return to the embrace of the motherland, and jointly build our great socialist motherland.

    We are peace-loving people, but we are not afraid of war. As long as American imperialism dares to risk launching a war, we will wipe out imperialism from the face of the earth.

    We will use the practical actions of doing a good job in agricultural production and striving for a greater bumper autumn harvest to strengthen the power of the motherland and support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. At the same time, we are also ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, go to the forefront of liberating the motherland's territory, and dedicate everything we have to liberating the motherland's territory.
                All members of the Nanshao Township, Weixing People's Commune, Changping District, Beijing

　　Intensify training, make preparations
　　PLA awaits orders to depart

    We have listened to Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area again and again on the radio. This statement fully represents the will and righteous actions of the Chinese people.

    Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have been our country's territory since ancient times. We will never give up until Taiwan is liberated. We resolutely respond to Premier Zhou's statement, take active action, wait for the call of the motherland at any time, come to the forefront of liberating Taiwan, and severely strike at American imperialism. We are soldiers defending the motherland. Our armed forces are very strong. If the American imperialists have not tasted enough of the lessons of defeat in the Korean War and dare to launch a war of aggression in the Taiwan Strait area to prevent us from liberating our territory, they will be made to taste our power again and be completely wiped out in the Taiwan Strait.
            Liu Zhixian, Ma Dejun, and nine others from the Construction Department of the Logistics and Management Department of the Beijing Military Region

    American imperialism, which has always been an enemy of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, disregarding the opposition of the people of the world, has not only failed to withdraw its robber troops from Lebanon, but has instead sent its beastly troops to invade the Taiwan Strait area, continue to occupy our country's territory of Taiwan, and carry out military provocations. We feel very angry. As members of the People's Liberation Army, we swear to the motherland: We will intensify our training, do a good job in preparing for war, and listen to the orders of the motherland at any time, to contribute everything we have to eliminate the American Chiang alliance and liberate Taiwan.
                            Wang Guohua, Li Zhihua, and six others from the Beijing Troops

　　Strengthen Learning and Do a Good Job
    We felt extremely excited after hearing Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area. We fully support this statement. Taiwan has been our country's territory since ancient times, and no one has the right to interfere in the Chinese people's own affairs of liberating Taiwan. In order to liberate Taiwan and ensure world peace, in addition to being ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, all faculty and staff of our school must also do a good job in teaching reform and use practical actions to support the liberation of Taiwan and strike at the American imperialists.
                      All faculty and staff of Huangcun Forestry College, Hebei Province

    After listening to Premier Zhou's statement, we unanimously expressed our firm support. Taiwan has been our country's territory since ancient times, and imperialism must not be allowed to occupy it. Liberating Taiwan is our country's internal affair, and imperialism must not be allowed to interfere. We must liberate Taiwan and let Taiwan and the people of Taiwan return to the embrace of the motherland. To this end, we declare to the Party that we will support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions and smash the aggression of American imperialism!

    1. Strengthen the study of current affairs and pay close attention to the activities of American imperialism. 2. Do our own work well and complete our leap forward plan ahead of schedule. 3. When the motherland needs us, we will definitely contribute everything we have!
                            All teachers of the History and Geography Group of No. 92 Middle School

　　We have people and materials
　　Women Fully Participate in the Anti-American Struggle

    The solemn statement made by Premier Zhou on behalf of the Chinese government fully expresses the wishes of every woman, elder, and child. We firmly protest against the American imperialists' occupation of our country's territory of Taiwan! We want to warn the United States that 600 million Chinese people are not to be trifled with! We must liberate our own territory! We have people and materials! If the American imperialists dare to touch us, all our women cadres will definitely sign up to join the righteous battle, and we will never give up until Taiwan is liberated!
                              All cadres of the Women's Federation of Xicheng District, Beijing

　　Grasp Judicial Weapons Tightly
    Suppress Counter-Revolutionary Elements

    For the integrity of the motherland's territory and to defend peace in Asia and the world, we swear to the Party:

    We are determined to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions. If the motherland gives an order, we will not hesitate to take up arms and go to the forefront of the struggle. We will fight back from where the enemy attacks.

    We are currently holding a judicial work conference. We guarantee to the Party that we will not neglect either the work conference or our regular duties. We will use a greater leap forward to protest the provocations of American imperialism with practical actions. If the remaining counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements dare to take the opportunity to make trouble, we will grasp judicial weapons tightly and resolutely and promptly suppress them, to consolidate the rear and ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction.

    Finally, we warn the American imperialists that they must get out of our country's territory and territorial waters! We have the right to take all appropriate methods to recover these areas at the appropriate time. If the American imperialists do not withdraw their claws, we will definitely send them into the belly of the fish.
                              All Comrades of the Beijing Intermediate People's Court

    Intensify Rehearsals and Rush to Prepare Programs
　　Use Propaganda Weapons to Severely Strike the Enemy

    We fully support Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area. This statement represents the feelings of 600 million people and peace-loving people all over the world. The American imperialists, unwilling to accept their defeat in Korea and the Middle East, ignoring the warnings of peace-loving people around the world, dared to gather troops in the Taiwan Strait and carry out military provocations against our country, directly interfering in our country's internal affairs of liberating Taiwan, and threatening peace in the Far East and the world. No warmonger can scare us or hinder our determination to liberate Taiwan. Liberating Taiwan is the sacred task of unifying the motherland, and no one is allowed to interfere. We are literary and art workers, and we must go to the streets and to factories and mines to expose the American military provocations in the Far East with our songs. At the same time, we must also publicize Premier Zhou's statement as soon as possible, so that everyone knows it.

    我们中国人民大学机床制造厂的全体工人坚决拥护周总理的声明，决心以实际行动来粉碎美国侵略者的军事挑衅。美帝国主义在台湾及远东地区制造紧张局势、破坏世界和平，我们决不能容忍这种强盗行为。我们坚决警告美国侵略者：台湾一定要解放，美国侵略者必须滚出去。中国人民有全世界爱好和平人民的支援，有决心、有力量粉碎侵略、保卫和平！
    我们是大学生，也是新工人，在最近一个半月的苦战中，制造出四部机床。现在我们正进入第二阶段的生产，我们以车间当战场，以工具作武器，要鼓起更大的干劲，以我们的生产成绩来支援我国的社会主义建设，支援解放台湾的斗争。我们一致表示：如果祖国发出号召，我们马上放下笔杆、工具，穿上军装、拿起枪杆，奔赴前线，把侵略者消灭在台湾海峡。

　　保证秋季大丰收
    我们完全拥护周总理的严正声明，坚决反对美帝国主义用武力干涉我国的内政，反对美帝国主义侵占我国的领土台湾。
    台湾是我国的神圣领土，我们一定要解放台湾。我们有权利、有力量使我们的台湾同胞从蒋介石卖国集团的统治中解放出来，回到祖国的怀抱中，共同建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国。

            北京军区后勤营管部建设处　刘志贤，马德俊等九人
    一贯与中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民为敌的美帝国主义，不顾世界人民的反对，不仅未从黎巴嫩撤出它的强盗军队，反增派其野兽兵侵入台湾海峡地区，继续霸占我国领土台湾，并进行军事挑衅。我们感到非常愤怒，作为人民解放军的成员，我们向祖国宣誓：加紧练兵，搞好备战，随时听候祖国的命令，为消灭美蒋，解放台湾而贡献自己的一切。
                            北京部队　王国华，李治华等六人
　　加强学习做好工作
    我们听了周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明以后，感到无比的兴奋。我们完全拥护这个声明。台湾自古以来就是我国的领土，解放台湾是中国人民自己的事情，任何人没有权利来干涉。为了解放台湾、确保世界和平，我们学校全体教职员除随时准备响应祖国的召唤外，我们还要做好教学改革工作，用实际行动，支援解放台湾，打击美帝国主义者。

    周总理代表中国政府提出的庄严声明，充分表达了我们每个妇女、老人和孩子的心愿。我们坚决抗议美帝国主义者侵占我国领土台湾！我们要警告美国，六亿中国人民是不好惹的！我们一定要解放自己的领土！要人有人，要物有物！假如美帝敢动我们一下，我们全体妇女干部一定报名参加正义的战斗，不解放台湾决不罢休！

    最后，我们警告美帝国主义者必须从我国的领土、领海滚出去！我们有权采取一切适当的方法在适当的时候收复这些地区。如果美帝国主义者再不缩回魔爪，我们一定把它们送进鱼腹。

    加紧练歌　赶排节目
　　用宣传武器痛击敌人
    我们完全拥护周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，这个声明代表着六亿人民和全世界爱好和平人民的心情。美帝国主义不甘心在朝鲜及中东的失败，不顾世界爱好和平人民的警告，竟胆敢向我台湾海峡集结军队，向我国进行军事挑衅，直接干涉我国解放台湾的内政，威胁远东和世界的和平。任何战争狂人吓不倒我们，阻挠不了我们解放台湾的决心。解放台湾是统一祖国的神圣任务，不允许任何人加以干涉。我们是文艺工作者，我们要到街头去，到工矿去，用我们的歌声揭露美国在远东的军事挑衅行动，同时我们也要尽快地宣传周总理的声明，使得家喻户晓。　中国评剧院　筱白玉霜　胡斌　魏荣元
