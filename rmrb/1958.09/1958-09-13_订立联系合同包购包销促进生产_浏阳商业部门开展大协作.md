Liuyang Commercial Departments Launch Major Collaboration by Signing Liaison Contracts and Guaranteed Purchase and Sales to Promote Production

(Our newspaper Changsha, 12th dispatch) The commercial departments of Liuyang County, Hunan Province, are carrying out socialist major collaboration with various economic departments, promoting a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and reforming the face of commercial work. By the end of June, the total amount of agricultural and sideline products purchased and released in the county had increased by 2.69 times compared with the same period last year, and the average income of each household in the county had increased by 46.13 yuan as a result. The total amount of various means of production transferred to lower levels in the first half of the year also increased by 2.26 times compared with the same period last year.

The major collaboration was carried out under the unified leadership and overall planning of the county party committee, and was launched on the basis of the county's commercial departments carrying out rectification movements, criticizing departmentalism, and strengthening political and ideological work.

The major collaboration is organized by adopting methods of signing liaison contracts between various departments, dividing collaboration zones, and holding regular collaboration meetings. The county is divided into seven economic collaboration zones, which are led by county party committee members who are responsible for their work. When business conflicts occur between departments, collaboration meetings are held to resolve them, making the relationship between industry and commerce, agriculture and commerce, and other departments as close as brothers. A new communist style of "everyone for me, I for everyone" is being established among the departments.

Native paper is a major source of income for farmers throughout the county. Last year, supply and marketing departments, state-owned paper mills, and handicraft cooperatives competed with each other to purchase papermaking raw materials, resulting in a reduction in native paper production throughout the county. The supply and marketing departments only completed 46% of the native paper procurement plan. This year, through collaboration meetings, the supply and marketing departments and paper mills divided the scope of procurement, and the supply and marketing cooperatives signed guaranteed purchase and sales contracts with the handicraft cooperatives. Starting with supporting production, procurement work was carried out. As a result, in the first half of the year, not only was the native paper procurement plan of the supply and marketing departments overfulfilled, but also the county's native paper production increased more than tenfold compared with the same period last year. New atmosphere has also emerged where tax and bank cadres assist in commercial work, and commercial cadres assist bank and tax departments in their work. (Hu Jian)

    订立联系合同包购包销促进生产
    浏阳商业部门开展大协作
    本报长沙12日电　湖南省浏阳县商业部门与各个经济部门之间，开展社会主义大协作，促进了工农业生产大跃进，革新了商业工作的面貌。到6月底止，全县收购农副产品的投放总额比去年同期增长二点六九倍，全县平均每户因此增加收入四十六点一三元。上半年下放各种生产资料的总额，也比去年同期增长二点二六倍。
    大协作是在县委统一领导、全面规划下进行的，是在全县商业部门经过整风运动，批判本位思想，加强政治思想工作的基础上开展起来的。
    大协作是采取各部门订立联系合同、划分协作区、定期召开协作会的办法组织的。全县划分七个经济协作区，由县委委员分工负责领导，各部门间发生业务上的矛盾时，即召开协作会议解决，使得工商、农商等部门之间的关系亲如兄弟，一种“人人为我，我为人人”的共产主义新风尚，正在各部门之间树立起来。
    土纸是全县农民一大宗收入。去年供销部门、国营纸厂和手工业社，互相争购造纸原料，造成全县土纸减产，供销部门也只完成土纸收购计划46％。今年通过协作会议，供销部门与造纸厂划分收购范围，供销社与手工业社订立包购包销合同，从扶植生产入手，开展收购工作。结果，上半年不仅供销部门土纸收购计划超额完成，而且全县土纸产量比去年同期增长十倍多。税收、银行干部协助做商业工作，商业干部协助银行、税收部门进行工作也出现了新气象。（胡坚）
