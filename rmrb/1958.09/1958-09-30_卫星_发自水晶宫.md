In this year's leaping development of the aquatic products industry, many high-yield records have emerged. To date, the high-yield "satellites" launched in freshwater and marine aquaculture include:

　　Seaweed Yield of 42,000 Jin per Mu

　　The seaweed cultivation group of Huangxia Cooperative of Tangyu Fishery Cooperative in Pingtan County, Fujian Province, achieved a high yield of 42,000 jin per mu of seaweed. The main experiences for high yield are: seizing the season, attaching more seedlings; eliminating pests; cultivating strong seedlings; resisting drought and preventing dew; reasonable harvesting; strengthening management and establishing a responsibility system; and increasing fertilization.

　　Miracle in Pond Fish Farming

　　A stone skin pond with a water surface of 2.89 mu in the Eighth Team of Yueping Fishery Cooperative in Hengyang City, Hunan Province, created a new record of an average yield of 30,125.7 jin per mu in four months.

　　The main reasons for this high yield in this pond this year are the deep water, dense stocking, rotational netting and releasing, sufficient feed, and strict implementation of advanced management systems. The entire pond is often kept at a water depth of nine to ten chi; and live water flushing is implemented. Every mu of water surface constantly maintains 50,000 domestic fish and 15,000 miscellaneous fish. (Lei Xianhan)

　　Kelp

　　The Third Team of the Youth Brigade of the Malanhe Cultivation Area of the Dalian Marine Aquaculture Farm cultivated 19.5 mu of kelp, with an average yield of 23,440 jin per mu, setting a new national record.

　　The creation of this record is mainly due to their full utilization of the water surface, adding small rafts of 15 meters in the blank water surface between the floating raft rows, which increased the yield by more than 3,000 jin per mu. In addition, they also adopted various reasonable technical measures.

　　Rice Fragrance, Fish Fat, Double Harvest

　　The fish raised in a 3.4 mu paddy field by the Sixth Team of Gaochong Cooperative in Hengnan County, Hunan Province, recently harvested a total of 3,430 jin of fresh fish, with an average yield of more than 1,008 jin per mu. The early rice in this field this year averaged 950 jin per mu, an increase of 97% over last year. (In the past, the general yield of pond fish farming in the local area was only 400-500 jin per mu, and the yield of rice-field fish farming was even smaller.)

　　Clams

　　The Huijing Brigade of the Xianfeng People's Commune in Heshang Township, Changle County, Fujian Province, harvested 50,380 jin of clams in 1.2 mu of clam beach, with an average yield of more than 41,983 jin per mu.

　　Latest Razor Clam Record Set in Gaofeng Commune

　　The Meihua Brigade of Gaofeng People's Commune in Changle County, Fujian Province, recently harvested a total of 54,432 jin of net razor clams in two mu of razor clam experimental beaches, with an average yield reaching 27,216 jin per mu, which is more than 3,000 jin more than the previous national record set by the Meihua United Cooperative in this county, once again breaking the national high-yield record for razor clams.

　　These two mu of "satellite" beaches were created by Chen Xingli, Lin Mingqin, Xie Fumu, Guan Shoushou and other twenty-five people from the Meihua Fishery Brigade. On the Beiwencheng ground where they created 10,000 jin of razor clams last year, they further promoted low-tide aquaculture, while improving the beach soil, cultivating meticulously (five plowing, five harrowing, and five smoothing), densely stocking (450 jin of razor clam seedlings per mu), and strengthening beach management (such as using sodium cyanide to kill oil dragons).

    “卫星”发自水晶宫
    在今年飞跃发展的水产事业中，出现了不少高额丰产纪录。截至目前，在淡水和海水水产中已经放出的高产“卫星”有：
    紫菜亩产四万二
    福建省平潭县塘屿渔业社黄吓社紫菜养殖小组的一亩紫菜，获得了四万二千斤的高额丰产。丰产的主要经验是，抓季节，多附苗；除敌害；育壮苗；抗旱，防露；合理采摘；加强管理，建立责任制度；增加施肥。
    池塘养鱼出奇迹
    湖南省衡阳市岳屏渔业社第八队的一口二亩八分九厘水面的石皮塘，四个月内创造了平均亩产三万零一百二十五斤七两的新纪录。
    这口塘今年能获得这样的高额丰产，主要是做到了水深、密养、轮网轮放、饲料足和严格的贯彻执行了先进的管理制度。全塘经常保持水深九尺至一丈；并实行了活水冲塘。每亩水面经常保持家鱼五万尾，杂鱼一万五千尾。  （雷贤汗）
    海带
    旅大海水养殖场马拦河养殖区青年队第三组养殖的十九亩半海带，平均亩产二万三千四百四十斤，创全国新纪录。
    这个纪录的创造，主要是他们充分地利用了水面，在浮筏排与排之间的空白水面增放了十五公尺的小型浮筏，使每亩增产三千多斤，此外还采用了各项合理的技术措施。稻香鱼肥双丰收
    湖南省衡南县高冲社第六队在一丘三亩四分稻田里养的鱼，最近共收鲜鱼三千四百三十斤，平均亩产达一千零八斤多。这丘田今年的早稻平均亩产九百五十斤，比去年增产97％。（往年当地池塘养鱼一般亩产只有四、五百斤，稻田养鱼产量更小。）
    花蛤
    福建省长乐县鹤上乡先锋人民公社壶井大队，在一亩二分花蛤?里收获花蛤五万零三百八十斤，平均亩产四万一千九百八十三斤多。养蛏最新纪录出在高丰公社
    福建长乐县高丰人民公社梅花大队最近在两亩蛏试验埕里共收净蛏五万四千四百三十二斤，平均亩产达到二万七千二百一十六斤，比原来这个县梅花联社所创的全国最高纪录又多了三千多斤，再次刷新全国蛏的高产纪录。
    这两亩“卫星”埕是梅花渔业大队陈兴利、林明钦、谢福牳、官寿寿等二十五人创造的。他们在去年创万斤蛏的北汶埕地上，再推向低潮养殖，同时改良埕土，精耕细作（五翻五耙五滑平）、密养（每亩蛏苗四百五十斤）、并加强了?间管理（如氰化钠杀油龙）。
