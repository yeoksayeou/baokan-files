　　Liaoyuan Commune What Work Did It Do Before Its Establishment?
　　Liu Guangluo, Secretary of the CPC Yanhe County Committee, Guizhou Province
　　When we saw Chairman Mao's message in the newspaper that "People's Communes are Good," the county party committee organized a work team to start a pilot project in Fuxing Township. After five days of work, the Liaoyuan People's Commune was established on August 22.

    Conditions for Establishing the Commune
    Fuxing Township is the focus of the county party committee. The township has 972 households, close to the city, with plains and hills each accounting for half of the area, and the population is relatively concentrated. In the winter of 1953, eleven primary cooperatives were established, which were transformed into two advanced cooperatives in early 1956. Years of increased production have enabled more than 3,000 people in the township to escape poverty and their lives have gradually become prosperous. In June of this year, the credit cooperative launched a savings campaign, and in a few days, 116,000 yuan was deposited, averaging 118 yuan per household. Therefore, the local farmers wholeheartedly support the leadership of the Party and the cooperative system. In particular, thanks to this year's Great Leap Forward, the township has achieved an even greater harvest. Based on an average of 428 jin per mu in 1957, it is expected to reach 2,100 jin in 1958, a fourfold increase compared to last year. While the members are enthusiastically harvesting the autumn crops, they also heard the good news about establishing "People's Communes." How could they not be happy? Listen! The men threshing grain in the fields and the women sunning grain on the threshing grounds are singing:
　　We thank the Communist Party for our liberation,
　　Poor villages have become prosperous villages.
　　We used to suffer from cold and hunger,
　　Now we have plenty of clothes and surplus grain.
　　The higher authorities instruct us to set up communes,
　　Every member is full of joy.
　　We are determined to build a ten-thousand-jin commune,
　　And fill the mountains with cattle and sheep.

    The Superiority of People's Communes
    The People's Commune is a higher form of socialist collective economy, with greater superiority than ordinary cooperatives. Through repeated discussions among the masses and cadres, it has been fully recognized that if the current cooperatives do not transform into People's Communes, they will not be able to adapt to the needs of the new situation, and the comprehensive development of industry and agriculture will be limited to a certain extent. The following facts can illustrate this:
    The Seventh Brigade of the Xingfu (Happiness) Cooperative is located in a hilly area, with more than 130 mu of land on slopes of more than 30 degrees. This is originally a good place to develop economic forests and animal husbandry. Due to the independent accounting of the teams, they have to grow crops in these places, resulting in soil erosion year after year, and the good fields on the dam are also filled with sand and stones washed down from the mountains.
    The Liaoyuan Cooperative is a large cooperative with more than 600 households. Due to the large area of land and good soil quality, most farmers are engaged in farming, and there is not even a single carpenter in the whole cooperative. Recently, when the proposal to advance towards semi-mechanization was put forward, the Liaoyuan Cooperative encountered difficulties because of the lack of technical personnel. The Xingfu Cooperative, due to its poor land conditions, had many "craftsmen" in the past, with more than 30 carpenters. Those carpenters also had opinions because they could not use their expertise.
    Due to the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, a new situation has emerged in which people are needed in all aspects, and the phenomenon of insufficient labor in agriculture has become increasingly prominent. However, about 20% of the labor force in the township has not been utilized. For example, the township has about 280 head of cattle. If they are organized into a grazing team, only 15 to 20 people would be needed. Because of the team management and household feeding, 100 laborers are occupied. In addition, because of the differences in the amount of land and labor between cooperatives and teams, it often happens that some units are idle and have nothing to do, while others are tense and lack labor.
    After the broad masses and cadres recognized these new problems and contradictions existing in the current cooperatives, they believed that running large-scale People's Communes is an inevitable trend to adapt to the development of production.

    Great Debate Resolved Concerns
    The People's Commune is a new organizational form, and its establishment was not smooth sailing, but encountered some resistance and misunderstandings.
    Many people misunderstood after hearing about the commune, thinking that "the commune is all about eating from the big pot." Some people said, "Everything is good about running a commune, except that eating from the big pot doesn't suit me." Some people also thought that establishing a commune meant "everyone works and everyone eats, so what's the point of paying according to labor?" After these problems appeared, we organized cadres to explain the policy of "pay according to labor" and more work more gain to the masses. On the other hand, we also launched a debate on "Is the canteen good? Is there a difference between running a canteen and eating from the big pot?" Through the debate, everyone agreed that the canteen is the most effective way to save labor, and participation in the canteen is entirely based on the principle of voluntariness. People who do not want to eat in the canteen can cook for themselves. In this way, those who had misunderstandings were relieved.
    Some people also misunderstood after hearing about the commune, thinking that "private raising of pigs, chickens, and sheep is not allowed." As a result, some people with many poultry panicked and ran to the township to get slips to request sales. The solution to this problem is: while the commune is developing animal husbandry on a large scale, private raising of poultry and livestock is allowed. For those who have too many poultry and livestock and cannot afford to raise them, they can be reasonably priced to the commune under the principle of voluntariness.
    Whether to keep private plots and how much to keep was the focus of everyone's debate. Most people realized that too many private plots have many disadvantages and affect the work of the cooperative, advocating for keeping less or none. Some people insisted on keeping private plots, their reason being: "Without private plots, we can't even get vegetables to eat." The result of the debate was: the cultivation team will arrange it uniformly and keep a small portion of private plots.
    Whether to distribute the grain from this year's autumn harvest and how to distribute it was also a matter of concern to everyone. If this issue is not handled properly, it will affect summer production and the management of late autumn crops. After we discussed it with the township and cooperative cadres, we handled it as follows: the autumn grain income of each cooperative this year still belongs to each cooperative and will be distributed according to the original charter.
    In the process of discussing the establishment of the People's Commune, individual wealthy peasants with more serious capitalist ideas were dissatisfied with running the People's Commune. For example, old middle peasant Cui Zhaohu said: "What commune, what society, isn't it just the same as doing production!" After we heard this remark, we immediately launched a big debate on "Is it good to run a People's Commune?" in the whole township. After two nights of debate, the vast majority of members realized the benefits of running a commune and demanded that it be established quickly.

    Militarization of Labor Organization
    What kind of organizational form is conducive to production? After our research with the Party branch, the result is this:
    The commune established a regimental headquarters, with one regimental commander (concurrently held by the director of the commune), four deputy regimental commanders, and seventeen members, responsible for directing the labor production of the entire commune. The headquarters set up a staff department (i.e., the office), with one chief of staff and one secretary, responsible for administrative affairs and handling daily work. The commune management committee has departments for industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, commerce, culture, education, health, and finance. In addition to the above organizations, a women's committee, a militia company, and a scientific research institute were also established.
    These cadres, except for the regimental commander, deputy regimental commanders, and financial personnel, generally do not leave production.

    Marching Towards a Yield of Ten Thousand Jin of Grain per Mu
    The Liaoyuan People's Commune is a combination of township and cooperative, integrating industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military into one, under unified leadership. In this way, it can better adapt to the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, tap the potential of labor and land, and at the same time, carry out division of labor and specialization in industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, give play to the members' expertise, and encourage the enthusiasm for learning and researching technology. The Liaoyuan People's Commune adapted to this new characteristic and formulated a plan for a comprehensive leap forward in production—marching towards a yield of ten thousand jin of grain per mu. The commune plans that the total grain output in 1959 will be 17,149,000 jin, with an average yield of 10,000 jin per mu; the total output of oil crops (rape) will be 722,000 jin, with an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu. Sixty-three pastures for cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, rabbits, and chickens will be established, raising a total of 341,480 livestock and poultry. One thousand buckets of bees will be raised, and 50,000 jin of fish will be raised. In terms of forestry production, the annual income from tung trees, fruits, and silkworms will be 112,500 yuan. Twelve factories will be built, with an output value of 283,500 yuan. The income from canteens, shops, etc. will be 5,000 yuan, and the total output value will be 1,717,500 yuan. The members are determined and confident to complete this plan.
    Running a People's Commune is a new task, and there are many issues that need to be further studied and resolved.

### 燎原公社  建社前做了哪些工作

　　燎原公社  建社前做了哪些工作
　　中共贵州省沿河县委书记　刘广洛
    当我们在报上看到毛主席说：“办人民公社好”的消息后，县委就组织工作组着手在复兴乡试办，经过五天的工作，已于8月22日成立了燎原人民公社。
    成立公社的条件
    复兴乡是县委的重点。全乡九百七十二户，离城近，平坝高坡各占一半，居住较集中；在1953年冬建立了十一个初级社，到1956年初即转为两个高级社。连年增产使全乡三千多人摆脱了贫困，生活逐步的富裕起来了。今年6月份信用社发动存款，没几天时间就存了十一万六千元，每户平均一百一十八元。因此，当地的农民对于党的领导、合作化制度是衷心拥护的。特别是由于今年的大跃进，又给该乡带来了更大的丰收，在1957年每亩平均四百二十八斤的基础上，1958年可达到二千一百斤，比去年增产四倍。社员们在以兴奋的心情进行秋收的同时，又听到了要办“人民公社”的喜讯，他们怎么不高兴呢？听吧！田野上打谷子的男子和晒谷场上的妇女，都正在唱着：翻身感谢共产党　穷村变成富裕庄从前挨冷又挨饿　如今多衣有余粮上级指示办公社　个个社员喜洋洋决心搞个万斤社　牛羊还要满山岗
    人民公社的优越性
    人民公社是一种更高的社会主义集体经济的形式，比一般合作社有更大的优越性。这次通过群众和干部的反复讨论，充分的认识到：如果现在的合作社不向人民公社转化，它就不能适应新形势的需要，会使工农业全面发展受到一定程度的限制。有这样几件事实可以说明：
    幸福社七大队是处在山坡地带，一百三十多亩地在三十度以上的坡上。这里本来是发展经济林木和畜牧业的好地方，由于分队核算，不得不在这些地方种庄稼，因此，年年造成水土流失，坝上的好田也被山上冲下来的砂石堆满了。
    燎原社是六百多户的大社，由于田土面积大，土质好，多数农民是务农的，全社连木匠也找不到一个。近来提出向半机械化进军时，燎原社就因为没有技术人员发生困难。幸福社由于田土条件差，过去做“手艺”的很多，该社木匠就有三十多人。那些木匠也因为不能发挥自己的专长有意见。
    由于工农业大跃进带来了各方面需要人的新局面，农业上劳力不足的现象已越来越显得突出。但是全乡约有20％的劳力没有发挥作用。譬如全乡有二百八十头耕牛，若组织成牧放队只需十五至二十人就够了，因为分队管理，分户喂养，就占用了一百个劳动力。另外，因为社与社、队与队之间，田土、劳力多少不一，这样就常常发生有的单位轻闲无事干，有的单位紧张，劳力不够用。
    在广大群众和干部认识了当前合作社存在的这些新问题、新矛盾之后，认为办规模较大的人民公社是适应生产发展的必然趋势。
    大辩论解除了顾虑
    人民公社是个新的组织形式，在酝酿成立的过程中并不是一帆风顺的，也碰到了一些抵触情绪和误解。
    不少一部分人听到办公社后，就误认为：“公社就是吃大锅饭。”有人说：“办公社什么都好，就是吃大锅饭不合我的意。”还有一部分人认为成立公社就是“大伙干，大伙吃，还讲什么按劳取酬。”出现这些问题后，我们一方面组织干部向群众讲解“按劳取酬”多劳多得的政策；另一方面也开展了“食堂好不好？办食堂和吃大锅饭是否有区别？”的辩论。通过辩论大家一致认为，食堂是节省劳力的一种最有效的办法，参加食堂完全根据自愿原则，不愿在食堂吃饭的人可自己开伙。这样有误解的人也就放心了。
    还有一部分人听到办公社后，误认为：“不准私人喂猪、鸡、羊了。”因而个别家禽多的有些恐慌，跑到乡里打条子要求出售。对于这个问题，是这样解决的：在公社大量发展畜牧业的同时，允许私人喂养家禽、家畜，对于家禽、家畜过多又无力喂养的，在自愿的原则下，合理折价归社。
    自留地留不留？留多少？是大家争论的焦点。多数人认识到自留地多了害处多，影响社里的活路，主张少留或不留。一部分人则坚持要留自留地，他们的理由是：“没有自留地连菜都得不到吃。”辩论的结果是：由耕作队统一安排，少留一部分自留地。
    今年秋收的粮食分不分？怎样分？也是大家关心的问题，这个问题如果处理不当，会影响夏季生产和晚秋作物的管理。我们和乡、社干部共同研究后是这样处理的：今年的秋粮各社收入仍归各社，按原订章程分配。
    在讨论人民公社建立过程中，个别资本主义思想较为严重的富裕农民对办人民公社是不满意的，如老中农崔照虎说：“什么公社、婆社，还不是同样的搞生产！”我们听到这种言论后，就立即在全乡开展了“办人民公社好不好？”的大辩论，经过两晚上的辩论后，绝大多数的社员认识了办公社的好处，要求迅速地办起来。
    劳动组织军事化
    组织形式到底怎样才能便于生产呢？经过我们和党支部研究的结果是这样：
    公社成立团指挥部，设团长一人（由社长兼），副团长四人，委员十七人，负责指挥全社的劳动生产。指挥部设参谋处（即办公室），设参谋长一人，秘书一人，负责行政事务，处理日常工作。社管会下设工业、农业、林业、畜牧、商业、文教卫生、财务等科。除以上组织外还建立了妇女委员会、民兵连和科学研究所。
    这些干部除了团长、副团长及财会等人外，一般不脱产。
    向亩产万斤粮进军
    燎原人民公社是乡社合一的，把工农商学兵合为一体，统一领导。这样，就能更好地适应工农业生产大跃进，挖掘劳力和土地潜力，同时在工、农、牧副业方面进行分工分业，发挥社员的专长，鼓励学习和钻研技术的积极性。燎原人民公社适应这一新的特点，制订了生产全面跃进规划——向亩产万斤粮进军。该社计划1959年粮食总产量为一千七百一十四万九千斤，平均亩产一万斤；油料作物（油菜）总产七十二万二千斤，平均亩产一千斤。建立牛、马、猪、羊、兔、鸡等牧场六十三个，共养家畜家禽三十四万一千四百八十只。养蜜蜂一千桶，养鱼五万斤。林业生产上，桐棬子、水果、蚕桑等的全年收入为十一万二千五百元。建工厂十二个，产值为二十八万三千五百元。食堂、商店等收入五千元，总产值为一百七十一万七千五百元。这一计划社员们有决心有信心完成。
    办人民公社是一件新的工作，有许多问题还要进一步研究解决。
