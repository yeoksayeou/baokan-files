Medicinal Herbs are a Treasure of the Mountains

    The Tongfeng Cooperative in Xixin Township, Shizhu County, Sichuan Province, is located in a high mountain area 1,500 meters above sea level. The soil is most suitable for planting local medicinal herbs. Beginning in March of this year, the township branch strengthened its leadership over medicinal herb production: publicizing the mountainous area production policy, explaining the great significance of developing local medicinal herbs for supporting socialist construction and improving people's health; organizing skilled herbalists to pass on planting and harvesting techniques. Now, medicinal herb production in the entire cooperative has flourished. To date, fifteen varieties, including Magnolia officinalis, Phellodendron chinense, and Ophiopogon japonicus, have been planted, and various varieties such as Codonopsis pilosula and Spiders silk have been cultivated. It is estimated that during the peak harvesting season this year, the cooperative can harvest major medicinal herbs such as Codonopsis pilosula and Gastrodia elata worth more than 1,000 yuan, plus minor medicinal herb income of more than 200 yuan, averaging an increase in income of more than 30 yuan per household.

    药材是山中一宝
    四川石砫县洗新乡同丰社是海拔一千五百公尺的高山社。土质最宜种植土产药材。今年3月份起乡支部加强了对药材生产的领导：宣传山区生产方针，讲明开发土产药材对支援社会主义建设和增进人民健康的重大意义；组织技术熟练的药农传授种药采药等技术。现在，全社药材生产已蓬勃展开，到目前止，已栽种厚朴、黄柏、麦冬等十五种，培育党参、蜘蛛香等多种品种。预计在今年药材挖采旺季，全社可挖党参、天麻等大宗药材价值一千多元，加上小宗药材收入二百多元，平均每户可增加收入三十多元。
