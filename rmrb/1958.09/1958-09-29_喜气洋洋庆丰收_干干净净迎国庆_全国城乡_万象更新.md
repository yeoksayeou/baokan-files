Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The people across the country, while joyfully celebrating the unprecedented bumper harvest in industry and agriculture, are enthusiastically carrying out a concentrated campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, preparing to achieve "cleanliness and tidiness to welcome National Day" throughout the country.

The climax of this campaign was formed after the release of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision on continuing to carry out the movement to eliminate the four pests, and under the vigorous organization and leadership of the party committees at all levels. The scale of the movement, its goals, and the achievements made are all unprecedented. More than ten million people in Zhejiang Province have participated in this movement. Shaanxi Province has proposed to basically achieve a "four-free" province before National Day. Fujian Province, at the forefront of the battle, in addition to eliminating several major endemic diseases in most areas, has also proposed to basically eliminate schistosomiasis in the province on National Day. In Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, from September 15th to 24th, more than 21 million person-times of people were invested in the movement. In Beijing, in the past ten days, more than 1.78 million person-times have participated in mosquito and fly eradication. Shandong and Hebei provinces have basically eliminated kala-azar. Anhui Province has recently mobilized more than 15 million people every day to fight mosquitoes and flies. In Yunnan Province, more than thirty "four-free" counties and cities have emerged in recent days. According to the statistics of the Central Patriotic Health Movement Committee on September 27th, 879 counties and cities in provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions) across the country have basically achieved "four-free." Now, in the vast cities and rural areas across the country, there is a new atmosphere of cleanliness and order everywhere, and the custom of "everyone paying attention to hygiene" has begun to appear in people's lives. The health conditions in many areas have undergone fundamental changes. For example, the Chenzhou area of Hunan was historically a highly prevalent area for malaria. In the past, there was a saying: "When the boat arrives at Chenzhou, it stops; when the horse arrives at Chenzhou, it dies; when the person arrives at Chenzhou, he gets malaria (the common name for malaria)." In September, nineteen counties and cities in Hunan Province, including Lianchen County, were declared basically malaria-free counties and cities. People joyfully sang: "In the past, malaria was like a tiger and a wolf, but now we enjoy health without illness. We thank the Communist Party for its kindness, and may our happy days last forever."

The workers who have created miracles in production have also shown a very active spirit in eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene. The more than 4,000 workers of the Shanghai Smelting Plant, an advanced health unit in Yangpu District, Shanghai, have consistently adhered to the system of cleaning once every two weeks during their intense production. In order to welcome National Day, they recently carried out two full-plant cleanings in five days. The factory workers' combination of production and hygiene has become a model for nearby factories to learn from.

A high tide of eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene has also been set off in the vast rural areas across the country. The Gucheng People's Commune in the suburbs of Zhengzhou City has recently mobilized more than 1,000 commune members every day to level streets, eliminate sewage, and clean up garbage. After two days and nights of hard work, the town has basically eliminated flies and mosquitoes.

The people of all ethnic minorities, who suffered deeply from the oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionary rule before liberation, and whose health conditions were seriously backward, have shown great enthusiasm for the current Communist Party-led movement to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene. In Yunnan Province, millions of people of all ethnic groups in the vast areas from Gaoligong Mountain to the Ailao Mountain foothills, from the Jinsha River to the Lancang River basin, have set off a wave of health campaigns to welcome National Day in a clean and tidy manner. In Mile County, Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, 200,000 people are mobilized every day to eliminate the four pests. Many counties such as Dali, Shuangbai, and Xichou have shower facilities. These days, farmers are taking showers in batches, preparing to put on new clothes to welcome National Day. People of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are currently carrying out a concentrated campaign to eliminate the seven pests and pay attention to hygiene in the vast rural, pastoral, and urban areas.

    喜气洋洋庆丰收  干干净净迎国庆
    全国城乡  万象更新
    据新华社28日讯  全国各地人民在喜气洋洋欢庆工农业空前大丰收的同时，正在热情欢腾地大搞除四害、讲卫生突击运动，准备在全国范围内作到“干干净净迎国庆”。
    这次突击运动的高潮是在中共中央关于继续展开除四害运动的决定发布后，并在各级党委的大力组织领导下形成的，运动的规模和奋斗目标以及取得的成绩都是空前的。浙江省已经有一千多万人参加了这次运动。陕西省提出了要在国庆节前基本实现“四无”省。战斗前线的福建省除已在大部分地区消灭了几种主要地方病以外，还提出国庆节要在全省基本消灭血吸虫病。江苏苏州专区从9月15日到24日投入运动的群众就有二千一百多万人次。北京市在最近的十天中，就有一百七十八万多人次参加灭蚊蝇。山东省、河北省两省已基本上消灭了黑热病。安徽省最近每天出动一千五百多万人大战蚊蝇。云南省在最近几天内就涌现了三十多个“四无”县市。根据中央爱国卫生运动委员会9月27日的统计材料，全国各省（市、自治区）已实现基本“四无”的有八百七十九个县市。现在，全国各地广大的城市和农村，到处都是一片清洁、整齐的新气象，人民群众的生活中也开始出现“人人讲卫生”的风俗习惯，许多地区卫生状况有了根本的改变。比如湖南郴州地区一带，历史上都是疟疾高度流行的地区，过去有“船到郴州止，马到郴州死，人到郴州打摆子（疟疾的俗名）”的说法。9月间，湖南省有连郴县在内的十九个县市被宣布为基本无疟县市，人们喜悦地唱道：“过去摆子似虎狼，如今无病享安康，恩情感谢共产党，幸福的日子万年长。”
    在生产中创造了奇迹的工人们，在除四害、讲卫生中也表现十分积极的精神。上海市杨浦区卫生先进单位上海冶炼厂的四千多工人们，在紧张的生产中一贯坚持每两周打扫一次的制度。为了迎接国庆，他们最近在五天内就进行了两次全厂大扫除。这个厂工人结合生产坚持打扫卫生已成为附近工厂学习的榜样。
    全国广大农村也掀起了除四害、讲卫生的高潮。郑州市郊区古荣镇人民公社最近每天有一千多个社员出动平整街道，排除污水，清理垃圾。经过两昼夜苦战，全镇已基本上消灭了苍蝇和蚊子。
    解放前由于深受国民党反动统治的压迫剥削，卫生状况严重落后的各个兄弟民族的人民，对现在的共产党领导的除四害、讲卫生运动表现了极大的热情。云南省从高黎贡山到哀牢山麓、从金沙江到澜沧江流域的广大地区的数百万各兄弟民族人民已掀起干干净净迎国庆的卫生运动热潮。红河哈尼族彝族自治州弥勒县每天出动二十万人消灭四害。大理、双柏、西畴等县的许多县都有了淋浴设备。这几天，农民们正在分批淋浴，准备穿上新衣迎接国庆。内蒙古自治区各族人民，目前正在广大农村、牧区和城市中突击进行除七害、讲卫生的活动。
