Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Comrade Havlín, a responsible staff member of the Science and Higher Education Department of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee, told our reporter that Czechoslovakia's higher education is developing in a direction that closely integrates with production and life. This is a historic transformation of the entire higher education system.

Since the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Czechoslovak institutions of higher learning have begun to study the reform of the teaching system to ensure that the country can cultivate communist builders who possess both basic scientific and technical knowledge and can engage in actual production. At present, many institutions of higher learning have found a variety of ways to combine teaching with production according to their different conditions. For example, some schools have established close ties with factories, with factories sending engineers and advanced workers to the schools to lecture, and students going to factories for production internships. Some factories have established workshops for local institutions of higher learning, where students carry out production internships and complete part of the factory's production plan. The value of the products they produce will be used to pay for the costs required to set up the workshops.

In order to adapt to these teaching reforms, Czechoslovak institutions of higher learning will enroll more young people with a certain amount of production practice knowledge and practical work experience in the future. Starting this year, young people who have completed secondary education will only be able to apply for university after participating in one year of industrial or agricultural labor.

    工人当教授　学生当学徒
    捷高等教育实行大变革
    据新华社讯　捷共中央科学和高等教育处负责工作人员哈夫林对本社记者说，捷克斯洛伐克高等教育事业正在向着同生产和生活密切结合的方向发展。这是整个高等教育制度的历史性的变革。
    自捷共第十一次代表大会以后，捷克斯洛伐克高等学校开始研究改革教学制度，以保证能够为国家培养出既掌握基本科学技术知识、又能从事实际生产的共产主义建设人材。目前许多高等学校根据各自不同的条件已找到了多种多样教学与生产相结合的途径。例如，有的学校和工厂建立了密切联系，由工厂派工程师和先进工人到学校去讲课，学生到工厂进行生产实习。有的工厂为当地的高等学校建立了工场，学生们在那里进行生产实习，并完成工厂生产计划的一部分，他们生产出的产品价值将用来偿付设立工场所需要的费用。
    为了适应这些教学的改革，捷克斯洛伐克高等学校今后将更多地招收有一定生产实践知识和实际工作经验的青年入学。从今年起，受完中等教育的青年只有在参加一年的工、农业劳动后才能投考大学。
