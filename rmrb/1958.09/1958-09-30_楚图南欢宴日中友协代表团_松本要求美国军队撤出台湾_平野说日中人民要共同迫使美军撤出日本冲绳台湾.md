Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, hosted a banquet tonight in honor of the delegation from the Japan-China Friendship Association visiting China.

At the banquet, Chu Tunan said that we were pleased to see the statement issued in Hong Kong on the 26th of this month in the name of the delegation from the Japan-China Friendship Association. As the statement points out, the cause of the current tense situation in Taiwan is due to America's war policy. The only way to resolve the current tension is for the American military to completely withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area.

Chu Tunan said: We warmly welcome the Japan-China Friendship Association's struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of following American imperialism and being hostile to the Chinese people, and promoting the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan. Only through resolute struggle can the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan be restored and developed.

Chu Tunan concluded by saying that the Chinese people have always valued cultural exchanges and friendly interactions between the peoples of China and Japan. We firmly oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's continued pursuit of a policy of enmity towards our people by following American imperialism, but it has not changed our friendly attitude towards the Japanese people in the slightest.

Jichiro Matsumoto, head of the delegation from the Japan-China Friendship Association, said at the meeting that we believe that enhancing the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China and restoring diplomatic relations between the two countries is the primary prerequisite for the happy life of the two peoples and the defense of peace in Asia. However, due to the Kishi Nobusuke government's adoption of a policy of hostility towards China and the implementation of an aggressive policy by American imperialism, relations between Japan and China have been severed today.

Jichiro Matsumoto also said that we believe that the root cause of the tense situation in Kinmen, Matsu, and the Taiwan Strait is due to the aggression of the American military. Therefore, we believe that in order to peacefully resolve this issue, American aggressors should first stop their aggression and withdraw their troops from Taiwan. The issue surrounding the Taiwan Strait is not just a matter for China, but it is not unrelated to our citizens. Because the American military has military bases in Japan, which undermine Japan's independence. Therefore, we are determined to make the Taiwan Strait issue our own issue and fight for Japan's independence and peace in Asia.

Yotaro Hirano, deputy head of the delegation from the Japan-China Friendship Association, then spoke at the meeting. He said that the Japanese people believe that the presence of American troops in Japan means the loss of Japan's independence, and the Japanese people express indignation at the American military's occupation of Taiwan. The common struggle of the Japanese and Chinese people is to force the American military to withdraw from Japan, Okinawa, and Taiwan.

Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and many other prominent figures from relevant fields attended the banquet.

Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: The delegation from the Japan-China Friendship Association, consisting of twelve people led by head Jichiro Matsumoto and deputy head Yotaro Hirano, arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon. The delegation is visiting our country at the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.

Those who welcomed the delegation at the airport included Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and many others.

    楚图南欢宴日中友协代表团
    松本要求美国军队撤出台湾
    平野说日中人民要共同迫使美军撤出日本冲绳台湾
    据新华社29日讯  中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南今晚举行宴会，招待日中友好协会访华代表团。
    楚图南在宴会上说，我们高兴地看到了以日中友好协会访华代表团名义于本月26日在香港发表的声明。正像声明所指出的，造成目前台湾紧张局势的原因是由于美国的战争政策。解决目前这种紧张局势的方法，只有美国军队完全撤出台湾和台湾海峡地区。
    楚图南说：我们十分欢迎日中友协所进行的反对岸信介政府追随美国帝国主义敌视中国人民的政策、促进恢复中日两国正常关系的奋斗。也只有坚决奋斗，才有利于恢复和发展中日两国人民的友好关系。
    楚图南最后说，中国人民一向重视中日两国人民之间的文化交流和友好往来。我们坚决反对岸信介政府继续追随美帝国主义与我国人民为敌的政策，但是丝毫没有改变我们对日本人民友好的态度。
    日中友好协会访华代表团团长松本治一郎在会上讲话说，我们认为，增进日中两国人民的友好和恢复两国的邦交是两国人民幸福生活和保卫亚洲和平的第一个前提。但是，由于岸信介政府采取了敌视中国的政策和由于美帝国主义执行了侵略政策，今天，日中两国的关系已经中断了。
    松本治一郎还说，我们认为，引起金门、马祖和台湾海峡的紧张局势的根本原因，是由于美国军队的侵略。因此，我们相信，为了和平解决这个问题美国侵略者首先应该停止侵略，应该撤兵台湾。围绕台湾海峡的问题，不单单是中国的问题，对我国国民来说也不是无关的事情。因为，美国军队在日本设有军事基地，破坏了日本的独立。因此，我们决心为日本的独立和亚洲的和平，把台湾海峡的问题，作为我们自己的问题来进行斗争。
    日中友好协会访华代表团副团长平野义太郎接着在会上讲话。他说，日本人民认为美国军队驻在日本是丧失了日本独立，日本人民对美国军队占领台湾表示愤慨。日本人民和中国人民的共同斗争是要美国军队从日本、冲绳岛、台湾撤出去。
    出席宴会的有中国人民对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志和有关方面的著名人士等多人。
    据新华社29日讯  日中友好协会访华代表团一行十二人在团长松本治一郎、副团长平野义太郎率领下，今天下午乘飞机到达北京。这个代表团是应中国人民对外文化协会的邀请前来我国访问的。
    到机场欢迎的有中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志等多人。
