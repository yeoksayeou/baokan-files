    The United States Is Venturing into the Worst Cause
    Originally published in the American "New York Post" on September 5th.
    Editor's Note: The American "New York Post" published an article by Lerner on September 5th. From this article, it can be seen that the US military provocative policy in the Taiwan Strait area has aroused serious concern and opposition within the American bourgeoisie. It shows that the United States' excuse for expanding its aggression to Jinmen and Matsu is so absurd that it cannot gain sympathy and trust within the United States. Clear-headed Americans have realized that this adventurous policy of the American aggressive clique has no future and is extremely isolated. Now, we publish an abstract of this article as follows:
    Although it seems hard to believe, we may soon be fighting a major war with Communist China over two Chinese coastal islands that mean nothing to us. We are about to wage a war in the worst location, with the worst allies, for the worst cause, in which it is almost impossible to hope that any free world country will join our cause. ... What madness has befallen us that we should adopt such a harmful attitude on the issue of these barren islands? Doing so has neither future, nor hope, nor meaning.
    I believe that this decision was made before the President and the Secretary of State went on vacation, not while golfing and fishing in Newport. I also believe that part of the motivation for doing so was to hope to "firm up" American policy to prevent our strength from disappearing little by little. They may think that a showdown with China is better than a direct showdown with Russia, and that a showdown now is better than a showdown later, because Russia's advantage in missiles will be even greater in the future than it is now.
    Regardless of the motivation, what is surprising about this decision is that it was made by two people, one being a president who is a military man, who is indifferent (or perhaps ignorant) of most of the exploratory discussions by scholars and commentators on the issue of the two Chinas, and the other being a Secretary of State who may know something about these discussions, but who deeply believes only in the arguments of one side of these discussions.
    Perhaps they think that even if a war breaks out, it will be a "limited" war, mainly limited to the Formosa Strait and mainland air bases. We will contend with the planes at these bases when we crush the blockade of Jinmen.
    They may even think that the world will praise our firm attitude, the Chinese Communists will respect this firm attitude, and will retreat.
    However, they are extremely wrong on both counts. In his statement, Dulles expressed regret for any action by the Communists to use force after threats, and tried his best to lay the foundation for appealing to our allies and friends. However, our appeal is unlikely to succeed. Apart from the likes of Chiang Kai-shek himself, no one in the world will regard Jinmen as a thriving cause. If it becomes another Korean War, we will have to fight this war without the help of the United Nations.
    But, one of the most bizarre aspects of our policy is our pathetic reliance on Chiang Kai-shek. Our "senior officials" say that if the Nationalist government can repel the blockade and possible attack entirely on its own, they would be proud to achieve all this glory, but if they fail, we will have to intervene.
    Of course, doing so is to give Chiang a signed blank check, allowing him to decide war or peace for us. Chiang has been waiting for a full decade to return to the mainland. Now, he is an old man in his seventies, and his army is also aging, so he cannot wait much longer. But, he cannot have this opportunity unless he puts us at war with the Communists—a war that may make his dreams come true and plant his flag on the mainland.
    He would be a bizarrely selfless knight if he showed that he could skillfully handle the Jinmen situation, thereby missing the opportunity to involve the United States in his war, missing the last opportunity to realize his dreams.
    That's why I feel melancholy about our way of doing things. We are like dreamwalkers, step by step walking towards the abyss of war with China, and every step is fatal.

### 美国在为最坏的事业冒险

    美国在为最坏的事业冒险
    原载九月五日美国“纽约邮报”
    编者按　9月5日美国“纽约邮报”刊载了勒纳所写的一篇文章。从这篇文章可以看出，美国在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅政策，已经引起了美国资产阶级内部的严重忧虑和反对。它说明美国要把侵略行动扩大到金门马祖的借口是如此荒谬，以致得不到美国国内的同情和信任。头脑清醒的美国人士，已经认识到美国侵略集团这种冒险政策是没有前途的，极端孤立的。现在，我们把这篇文章摘要发表如下：
    虽然看来难以相信，但是我们可能快要为了两个对我们毫无意义的中国沿海岛屿问题，同共产党中国进行一场大战了。我们快要在最坏的地点，同最坏的盟国一起，为了最坏的事业进行一场战争，在这场战争中几乎不可能希望有任何自由世界的国家来参加我们的事业。……我们患了什么疯病要在这些不毛岛屿的问题上采取如此有害的态度呢？这样做既没有前途也没有希望和意义。
    我认为，这个决定是在总统和国务卿休假以前作出的，而不是在新港打高尔夫球和钩鱼时作出的。我还认为，这样做的一部分动机是希望使美国的政策“坚定起来”，以防我们的力量一点点消失。他们可能认为，与中国摊牌比直接与俄国摊牌要好，现在摊牌比以后摊牌要好，因为以后俄国在导弹方面的优势甚至比现在还大。
    不管动机如何，这个决定令人吃惊的地方是：它是由两个人作出的，一个是身为军人的总统，他对学者和评论员关于两个中国问题的大部分探索性讨论是漠不关心的（也许是无知的），另一个是国务卿，他可能知道这种讨论的一些情况，但是他只深深相信这种讨论的一方的论点。
    也许他们认为，即使发生战争的话，也将是一次“有限”战争，主要局限于福摩萨海峡和大陆的空军基地。我们在粉碎对金门的封锁时会与这些基地上的飞机较量。
    甚至他们可能认为，世界将赞扬我们的坚决态度，中国共产党将会尊重这种坚决态度，并将撤退。
    但是，他们在这两个方面都是极其错误的。杜勒斯在他的声明中对共产党在威胁之后使用武力的任何行动表示遗憾，竭力为向我们的盟国和朋友呼吁打下基础。但是，我们的呼吁是不可能成功的。除了蒋介石之流本身以外，世界上没有一个人将把金门看作是一个兴隆的事业。如果它成了另一次朝鲜战争的话，我们将不得不在没有联合国帮助的情况下进行这次战争。
    但是，我们的政策的最古怪的一个方面是我们很可怜地依靠蒋介石。我们的“高级官员”说，如果国民党政府能完全靠自己的力量击退封锁和可能的进攻的话，他们是会自豪地取得全部这种光荣的，但是，如果他们失败，我们将要插手。
    当然，这样做是要给蒋一张签了字的空白支票，让他来为我们决定战争还是和平。蒋为了返回大陆已经等了整整十年。现在，他是一个年过七十的老人，他的军队也日益年老，因此，他不能再等很长时候了。但是，他不可能有这种机会，除非他使我们同共产党人开战——这次战争可能使他的梦想得到实现，把他的旗帜插上大陆。
    如果他表现出他能巧妙地应付金门局势，从而错过了使美国参与他的战争的机会，错过了实现他的梦想的最后机会的话，他会成为一个古怪的大公无私的骑士。
    这就是为什么我对我们的作风感到忧郁的原因。我们像梦是个游者，一步步地走向与中国作战的深渊，而每一步都是致命的。
