Seconds Count

Four days of September have already passed, leaving only one hundred and eighteen days until the end of the year. Now it's like running the 100-meter dash. From the start, we must sprint with all our might, seizing every second to achieve victory. We cannot be leisurely as if running a 10,000-meter marathon, where we can take our time at the beginning. If the entire production plan is to double within these days, then it must double every day from the first day. If it cannot double on one day, then the next day must bear a double burden. In short, the tighter we grasp the beginning, the more proactive we will be, and the more guaranteed the completion of the Great Leap Forward plan will be. Conversely, the easier the beginning, the heavier and more passive the later stages will be.

Judging from the starting posture of the steel plants in Shanghai, they are very experienced and ambitious veterans. Enterprises aspiring to compete with them, quickly seize the opportunity and accelerate your pace!

    分秒必争
    9月份已经过去了四天，到年底只剩一百一十八天了。现在好比跑百米，从一起步就要猛力冲刺，分秒必争，才能取得胜利，不能像跑万米长途，开头还可以不慌不忙。在这些日子里，如果整个生产计划要翻一番，那么，从第一天起，每天就要翻一番，如果有一天不能翻一番，那么，另一天就要担负双重的任务。一句话，开头抓得越紧，就越主动，完成跃进计划就越有保证。反之，开头越轻松，后来就越繁重，越被动。
    从上海各钢厂起步的姿态看来，他们是很有经验、雄心很大的老运动员，有志同他们较量的企业，赶快掌握时机，加快你们的步伐吧！
