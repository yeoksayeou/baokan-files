    Achieving Communization, Great Development in Production

    Xinhua News Agency report: The rural areas of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have achieved people's communization. The newly established 913 people's communes are generally one commune per township, with an average of 2,000 to 5,000 households per commune. The larger communes have more than 10,000 households.

    After the establishment of the people's communes, a new atmosphere has emerged in industrial and agricultural production. According to statistics from relevant departments, as of September 8, the newly formed iron and steel army in the region has reached 1,010,000 people, and 22,517 iron smelting furnaces have been built. The average daily output of pig iron has increased from 160 tons last month to 207 tons. The average daily output of steel has jumped from 9 tons last month to 27 tons.

    The progress of field management in the region has increased from 750,000 mu per day before the establishment of the communes to 1,500,000 mu per day. At least 5 million commune members and rural cadres participate in field management every day, of which about 2.5 million are stationed day and night in field sheds, breathing with the seedlings and acting as doctors for the crops.

    After completing the task of establishing people's communes, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is now shifting to the stage of consolidation and improvement. The main content of this stage is to handle the means of production, solve the distribution methods, and formulate production plans. The specific approach is to rely on poor and lower-middle peasants and through communist education and airing views and debates.

    Xinhua News Agency report: As of September 13, Heilongjiang Province has basically realized people's communization in rural areas, with 97.4% of farmers joining people's communes. The province has merged the original 9,779 agricultural production cooperatives into 718 comprehensive people's communes, averaging about 3,000 households.

    After the establishment of the people's communes, greater leaps have occurred in production. According to statistics on September 12, the number of people participating in various production and construction activities in the province reached more than 5 million, accounting for more than 60% of the total rural population. More than 1.5 million people are participating in water conservancy construction, which is twice as many as the number of workers during the peak of water conservancy construction last year; the daily progress of the project is more than ten times higher than last year. A large number of collective welfare undertakings have been established to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production, enabling many women to get rid of housework and participate in various production activities. After the establishment of people's communes, various places have expanded the public accumulation of the communes, rationally used funds, and accelerated the pace of basic industrial and agricultural construction and agricultural mechanization and electrification.

    广西·黑龙江
    实现公社化　生产大发展
    据新华社讯　广西僮族自治区农村已经实现了人民公社化。新建成的九百一十三个人民公社，一般是一乡一社，每社平均两千至五千户，其中较大的公社有一万多户。
    人民公社建立后，在工业和农业生产上已经出现了新的气象。据有关部门统计，到9月8日止，全区新组成的钢铁大军已达一百零一万人，建成的炼铁炉已有二万二千五百十七座。生铁平均日产量由上月的一百六十吨，增加到二百零七吨。钢的平均日产量由上月的九吨跃进到二十七吨。
    全区田间管理进度，每天由公社建立前的七十五万亩提高到一百五十万亩。参加田间管理的公社社员和农村干部，每天至少出动五百万人，其中约有二百五十万人日夜驻扎在田头工棚里，与禾苗共呼吸，给庄稼当医生。
    广西僮族自治区完成人民公社建社任务之后，正转入巩固提高阶段。这一阶段的主要内容是处理生产资料、解决分配办法和制订生产规划。具体做法是：依靠贫农和下中农，通过共产主义教育和鸣放辩论。
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省农村到9月13日已基本实现人民公社化，占97.4％的农户都加入了人民公社。全省由原有的九千七百七十九个农业生产合作社合并转成综合性的人民公社七百一十八个。平均三千户左右。
    人民公社建立后，生产上出现了更大跃进。全省据9月12日统计，参加各项生产建设的人数达到五百多万，占农村男女老少人口总数的60％以上。参加水利建设的一百五十多万人，比去年水利建设高潮时出工人数还多两倍；工程日进度更比去年提高十倍以上。围绕生产大跃进的需要，兴办了大批集体福利事业，使许多妇女摆脱了家务劳动，参加到各项生产中来。建立人民公社后，各地扩大了公社的公共积累，合理使用资金，加速了工农业的基本建设和农业机械化、电气化的速度。
