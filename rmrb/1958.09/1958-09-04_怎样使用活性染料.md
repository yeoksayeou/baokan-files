    The usage of reactive dyes is also very simple, and ordinary households can use it. The specific method is as follows:
    Before dyeing, soak the fabric to be dyed in a 10% alkaline solution and boil it, or soak it in 2% Turkey red oil (which can be bought in chemical stores), then wash it with water and wring it dry.
    The method of preparing the dye is: first mix the dye with cold or warm water into a paste, then add cold water to completely dissolve the dye, and then add some salt water and stir well.
    Soak the fabric to be dyed in this dye solution and stir constantly. After fifteen minutes, add some salt water; after soaking for twenty minutes, add a little alkaline solution; after half an hour, take it out, rinse it in water, then put it in soapy water and boil for five minutes, then take it out, wash it with water, and dry it.

    怎样使用活性染料
    活性染料的用途很广，能染棉、丝、麻、毛和各种人造纤维。它染色的坚牢度极高，日晒，雨淋，用肥皂洗和磨擦都不褪色。
    活性染料的用法也很简便，一般家庭都可以应用。具体方法如下：
    在染色之前，先把要染的织物泡在10％的碱水里煮一下，或者在2％的土耳其红油（化工商店可以买到）里泡一泡，然后用水洗净，绞干。
    调剂染料的方法是：先用冷水或温水把染料调成粘体，再加冷水使染料完全溶解，然后加一些食盐水搅匀。
    要染的织物泡到这种染料溶液里，不断搅动。十五分钟以后，加进一些食盐水；泡过二十分钟，再加一点碱水；半小时以后拿出来，放在水里清洗一遍，再放到肥皂水里煮五分钟，然后拿出来用水洗净，晾干。
