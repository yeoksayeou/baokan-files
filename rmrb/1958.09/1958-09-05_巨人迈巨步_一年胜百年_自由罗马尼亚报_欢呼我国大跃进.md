Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, September 4th. The "Free Romania" newspaper published an article on the 3rd titled "Giant Strides," hailing the achievements of China's Great Leap Forward.

The article states: The astonishing speed of industrial development in People's China astonishes and delights the friends of the hardworking and intelligent Chinese people. It is no exaggeration to say that in just a few years, China has achieved accomplishments in eliminating past backwardness and tapping its economic potential that other countries could not achieve in decades, or even centuries. Many previously drafted plans and drafts have been revised, expanded, and enriched in the course of practice because the rapid development of economic construction requires the people to always look forward and always move forward with vigor.

The article then points out that the brilliant prospects of China's Great Leap Forward are fully reflected in the call of the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to increase this year's steel production to 10.7 million tons. This call demonstrates the tremendous creativity of China's 600 million people and demonstrates their ability to realize the most audacious plans. This call is of extreme importance at the moment, proving that the day China becomes a powerful industrial country is not far off. After steel production exceeds 10 million tons, China will rank sixth in the world in steel production, and then it will be among the ranks of the industrial powers. In addition, China will surpass the United Kingdom in coal production next year, and pig iron production will also soon exceed the United Kingdom. This makes it clear that China is making great strides in the competition with major capitalist countries. The article states that the Chinese people will certainly complete the new task of increasing steel production put forward by the Party within the scheduled time. The key here lies in the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the mass creative upsurge that has achieved great achievements.

The article then talked about this year's unprecedented bumper harvest in Chinese agriculture, pointing out that China's economic development shows that it is a huge and constantly strengthening force.

The article concluded by saying that due to the close cooperation with fraternal socialist countries, the strength of People's China has grown and will become even stronger. There is no doubt that any provocation by imperialism against People's China and their fantasies of preventing China from advancing will be smashed like an egg against a rock. No one can lead the Chinese people away from the path they have chosen.

　　巨人迈巨步　一年胜百年
　　“自由罗马尼亚报”欢呼我国大跃进
    新华社布加勒斯特4日电　“自由罗马尼亚报”3日以“巨人的步伐”为题发表文章，欢呼中国大跃进的成就。
    文章说：人民中国工业发展的惊人速度使得勤劳聪明的中国人民的朋友为之赞叹不已。可以毫不夸张地说，仅仅在几年的时间里，中国在消灭过去遗留下的落后状态和挖掘它的经济潜力方面已达到了其他国家几十年，甚至几个世纪也无法达到的成就。以前拟订的许多计划和草案，在实践过程中被修改、扩大和丰富了，因为经济建设的神速发展，要求人民永远向前看，永远迈着生龙活虎的步伐前进。
    文章接着指出，中国大跃进的辉煌前景在中国共产党中央政治局扩大会议关于把今年的钢产量提高到一千零七十万吨的号召中得到了充分的反映。这一号召表明了中国六亿人民的巨大创造力，表明了他们有实现最大胆的计划的能力。这个号召在目前有极重要的意义，它证明中国成为强大的工业国的日子已经为期不远了。在钢产量超过了一千万吨以后，中国将在钢产量上占世界第六位，那时它就将跻身于工业强国之列。此外，中国明年在煤产量上就要超过英国，生铁的产量也很快可以超过英国。这使人们清楚地看到，中国在和主要的资本主义国家竞赛中的巨大步伐。文章说，中国人民一定会在预定的时间内完成党所提出的关于提高钢产量的新任务。这里的关键在于中国共产党的英明领导和已获得了巨大成就的群众性的创造高潮。
    文章接着谈到了今年中国农业的史无前例的大丰收，指出中国的经济发展表明它是一支不断加强着的巨大力量。
    文章最后说，由于同社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的亲密合作，人民中国的力量增长了，并将更加强大。毫无疑问，帝国主义对人民中国的任何挑衅以及它们阻止中国前进的幻想，都会像鸡蛋碰石头一样碰得粉碎。没有任何人能够使中国人民离开他们所选择的道路。
