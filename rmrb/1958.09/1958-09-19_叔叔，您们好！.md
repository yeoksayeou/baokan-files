    Hello, Uncles!
    Dearest Liberation Army Uncles on the Fujian Front:
    How are you! When we heard that the farmers, workers, and students in Jiangtou, a suburb of Xiamen, were subjected to frantic bombardment by U.S. imperialism, the angry feelings of all our classmates were impossible to suppress.
    Uncles, we must never tolerate this atrocity by the enemy, we must avenge our compatriots who died! We are constantly listening for the call of the motherland, and when necessary, we will put down our pens, pick up our weapons, rush to the front of the war, and go through fire and water with you to defend the motherland and defend world peace.
    In order to support you uncles in liberating Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands with practical actions, we hereby express our determination to you:
    1. Study hard, exercise, and be ready at all times to listen to the call of the motherland; 2. Do a good job in work-study programs, engage in industry on a large scale, and make a big noise about steel; 3. Vigorously carry out propaganda activities to raise the political and ideological awareness of the masses and support the liberation of Taiwan.
    Dear uncles, let us, in a distant place, wish you an early liberation of Taiwan and avenge our compatriots who died!

    叔叔，您们好！
    最亲爱的福建前线解放军叔叔：
    您们好吧！当我们听到在厦门市郊江头的农民、工人和学生受到美帝国主义疯狂的轰击时，我们全体同学的愤怒心情，是无法抑制的。
    叔叔们，我们决不能容忍敌人的这种暴行，我们要为死难的同胞报仇！我们时时在听着祖国的召唤，在必要时，我们要放下笔杆，拿起武器，奔向战争的前方，和你们一道赴汤蹈火，保卫祖国，保卫世界和平。
    为了以实际行动支援叔叔们解放台湾、澎湖和沿海岛屿，我们特向你们表示决心：
    1、努力学习，锻炼身体，时刻准备着听候祖国的召唤；2、要作好勤工俭学，大搞工业，大闹钢铁；3、大力进行宣传活动，提高群众的政治思想觉悟，支援解放台湾。
    亲爱的叔叔们，让我们在遥远的地方，预祝您们早日解放台湾，为死难的同胞们报仇！
