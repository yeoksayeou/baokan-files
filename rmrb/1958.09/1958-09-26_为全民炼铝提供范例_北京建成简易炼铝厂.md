    Providing a Model for Aluminum Refining by All People
    Beijing Builds Simple Aluminum Plant
    (Our reporter Léi Rùnmíng reports) A simple aluminum plant combining indigenous and foreign methods—the Beijing Electrolytic Aluminum Plant—officially began production on the 19th. It broke the conventions of aluminum plant construction, creating a series of experiences for building small aluminum plants with more, faster, better, and more economical results: less electricity consumption, faster construction, less investment, significant savings in steel, and simpler construction. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry believes that the construction experience of this plant provides a model for the national aluminum refining industry by all the people, and it has universal promotion value throughout the country.
    Currently, aluminum refining uses the electrolytic method, so the supply of electricity is a prerequisite for developing the aluminum refining industry. One of the biggest advantages of this small aluminum plant, with an annual output of 1,000 tons of aluminum, is its low electricity consumption. It only requires 2,000 to 2,300 kilowatts of electricity for production. This small amount of power can be resolved either by making full use of decentralized power or by building small power stations.
    This small aluminum plant created many experiences in saving steel during construction, the most important of which is using ordinary gray bricks instead of steel to build electrolytic cells. Electrolytic cells are a crucial component of an aluminum plant. According to conventional aluminum plant construction, the electrolytic cell structure is made of steel. This factory boldly broke this convention and used ordinary gray bricks instead of steel, using only a steel arc around the outside of the brick trough. This reduced the steel consumption of each cell from 2.8 tons to 0.34 tons, saving the entire plant's eighty electrolytic cells over 200 tons of steel. Using bricks instead of steel to build the troughs also simplified construction. Based on the small scale of the factory, the plant also adopted a brick and wood structure for the plant buildings and did not install ventilation equipment and cranes inside the plant, which also saved a significant amount of steel and equipment.
    Carbon bricks are an important material for building the bottom of electrolytic cells, but currently only one factory in the country produces them. This aluminum plant experimented with using carbon paste instead of carbon bricks to build the electrolytic cells. After being put into production, the situation is good, and the product quality is up to standard. Carbon paste is made by roasting anthracite coal and coke and then using asphalt. It can be prepared in various places. Using carbon paste instead of carbon bricks not only solves the problem of carbon brick shortage but also makes the construction technology easy for ordinary workers to master, thus providing important conditions for the widespread development of the aluminum refining industry.
    This plant also simplified the anode operating device inside the electrolytic aluminum cell. According to convention, the anode operating device requires fourteen bevel gears and four lead screws, but after simplification, only one lead screw and two wooden sticks are used to operate it. The lead screw is relatively easy to manufacture, and general lathes can produce it. After the operating device is simplified, the operating technology is also simplified.
    The basic construction force of this factory was a house repair service cooperative from Xuanwu District in Beijing, who had never seen an electrolytic aluminum plant before. Facts have proven that for this type of small aluminum plant, except for the rectifier workshop, which requires specialized technicians for installation, other projects can be undertaken by general construction workers.
    Because this electrolytic aluminum plant is small in scale and has undergone many major reforms in design and construction, its construction speed is particularly fast, and the investment is very economical. This plant only took forty days from the start of construction to being put into production. If grasped tightly, the construction period can be shortened.
    Currently, only the electrolysis part of this factory has been put into production. It will be gradually expanded into a basic self-sufficient small-scale combined enterprise, producing its own alumina, carbon electrodes, and oxide salts required for electrolytic aluminum.

### 为全民炼铝提供范例  北京建成简易炼铝厂

    为全民炼铝提供范例
    北京建成简易炼铝厂
    本报讯  记者雷润明报道：一座土洋结合的简易炼铝厂——北京电解铝厂在19日正式投入生产了。它打破了建设铝厂的常规，创造了用电少、建设快、投资省、大量节省钢材、施工简易等一系列多快好省建设小型炼铝厂的经验。冶金工业部认为，这个厂的建设经验为我国全民办炼铝工业提供了一个范例，在全国有普遍推广价值。
    目前炼铝都采用电解的方法，因此电的供应是当前发展炼铝工业的先决条件。这座年产千吨铝的小型铝厂，最大的好处之一是用电少。它只用两千至两千三百瓩的电即可进行生产。这样小的发电量，既可以靠充分运用分散的电力来解决，也可以用建设小型电站的办法来解决。
    这个小型铝厂在建设中创造了许多节省钢材的经验，其中最重要的一项是用普通灰砖代替钢材砌造电解槽。电解槽是炼铝厂的一个最重要的组成部分。按照建设铝厂的常例，电解槽结构都是用钢材。这个工厂大胆打破了这个成规，改用普通灰砖来代替钢材，只在槽子的外围用一个钢弧把砖槽弧起来。这样，就使每个槽子的用钢量由二点八吨降低到零点三四吨，全厂八十个电解槽因此节省钢材二百多吨。用砖代替钢材砌槽，施工也比较简单。这个厂还根据工厂规模小的特点，在厂房建设上采用了砖木结构，厂房内也没有安装通风设备和吊车，这也节省了大量钢材和设备。
    炭砖是砌造电解槽底的重要材料，但是目前全国只有一个工厂生产。这个炼铝厂试验用炭糊代替炭砖建成了电解槽，投入生产后情况良好，产品质量合格。炭糊是把无烟煤、焦炭焙炒后用沥青制成，各地都可以配制。用炭糊代替炭砖，既解决了炭砖缺乏的问题，施工技术上又容易为一般工人所掌握，因此为普遍发展炼铝工业提供了重要条件。
    这个厂还简化了电解铝槽内的阳极操纵装置。按照常例，阳极操作装置需要十四个伞齿轮，四根螺旋杆，简化以后只用一根螺旋棍和两根木棍来操纵。螺旋棍制作比较容易，一般车床就可以生产。操纵装置简化以后，操纵技术也随着简化了。
    这个工厂施工的基本力量，是从未见过电解铝厂的北京市宣武区的一个房屋修缮服务社。事实证明，像这种小型铝厂，除整流车间需要专门技术工人进行安装外，其他工程一般建筑工人完全可以承担。
    因为这个电解铝厂规模小，在设计施工中又进行了许多重大改革，所以它的建设速度特别快，投资十分节省。这个厂从开工兴建到投入生产只用了四十天的时间。如果抓得紧些，建成期还可以缩短。
    现在，这座工厂投入生产的只是电解部分。它还要逐渐扩建成为一个基本自给自足的小型联合企业，自己生产电解铝所需用的氧化铝、炭极、氧化盐等。
