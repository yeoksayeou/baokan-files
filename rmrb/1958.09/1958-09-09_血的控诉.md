On September 6th, at approximately 10:30 AM, as farmers and workers in the Jiangtou Township suburbs of Xiamen City were engaged in labor and production in the fields and on construction sites, the artillery of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, entrenched on Jinmen Island, under the instigation of their masters, inhumanely launched a frenzied bombardment against peaceful residents. A series of intense artillery shells exploded on the ground and at low altitude in areas such as Xiangdian Village, Xiamen Third Middle School, and Puyuan Village, killing eleven workers, farmers, and students on the spot, wounding twenty-four people, killing four head of cattle, and destroying and damaging some civilian houses, school buildings, and other materials, seriously disrupting the lives, property, and peaceful and happy existence of the people of Jiangtou Township.

On that day, over six hundred teachers and students at Xiamen Third Middle School were in class when the Chiang bandit troops' American-made artillery shells suddenly attacked. The teacher's office, first-year classrooms, and student dormitories were all damaged. Students Zhang Kunming, Zheng Anguang, and others were successively blown to bits. Teacher Qiu Jiyi, who bravely rescued the injured students amidst the flying shrapnel, was also wounded by successive American-made artillery shells. Huang Jin, the only son of overseas Chinese Huang Youyi, who had just been admitted to Xiamen Medical College, happily returned from registering at the medical college that day to report the good news to his mother, but unexpectedly he was killed en route by an air-burst artillery shell from the Chiang bandit troops. Chen Yaxing, a fourth-grade student at Jiangtou Primary School, and his sister Chen Jiazhi, were helping the agricultural cooperative raise pigs when they were suddenly wounded and killed by artillery shells from the Chiang troops. Hong Yaodun, who brought his wife to the construction site to participate in the water pipe laying project, was wounded on the spot by artillery shells from the Chiang troops. When he saw the tragic sight of his wife, Zhang Qufu, being blown in two at the waist by artillery shells from the Chiang troops, he said with grief and indignation: "U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have harmed me so terribly. As long as I don't die, I will definitely take revenge!"

Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, this new bloody crime of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has aroused the infinite anger of the people of Jiangtou Township and Xiamen City. Teachers and students of Xiamen Third Middle School and the people of various villages in Jiangtou Township have successively held condemnation meetings, unanimously guaranteeing to transform grief and indignation into strength, and to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinmen and Taiwan, and thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique with practical actions such as stepping up production and actively supporting the front lines, to avenge the dead and injured compatriots. Wang Shenglang, a student at the Third Middle School and deputy captain of the picket brigade, said: "I personally participated in rescuing and burying the victimized classmates. I will never forget that the artillery shells that killed and injured our classmates were made in America and shipped overseas by American warships. It is a blood debt owed by U.S. imperialism after attempting to expand its scope of aggression in the Taiwan Strait region. In addition to guaranteeing to do a good job in picket work and studying hard, I will also take up a gun and go to the front line to fight the enemy fiercely when the motherland needs me, to avenge this blood debt for the dead and injured classmates and compatriots." Chen Huiqun, the deputy production team leader of the Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative, whose son was injured and daughter was killed, said angrily: "A blood debt must be repaid with blood. I will definitely take the most resolute action to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinmen and Taiwan, eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and shattering any aggressive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, to avenge my eldest son and eldest daughter."

　　血的控诉
    新华社记者　陈启桐　林俊卿
    9月6日上午十时半左右，当厦门市郊江头乡的农民、工人，正在田间和工地上进行劳动生产的时候，窃踞在金门岛上的美帝国主义走狗蒋介石卖国集团的炮兵，在其主子唆使下，惨无人道地向和平居民进行疯狂轰击，一阵阵猛烈的炮弹在祥店村、厦门第三中学、浦园村等地的地面和低空中爆炸，当场打死工人、农民和学生十一人，打伤二十四人，打死耕牛四条，打毁和打坏民房、校舍和其他物资一部，使江头乡人民的生命财产和和平幸福生活受到严重破坏。
    那天，厦门第三中学六百多名师生正在上课，蒋贼军的美制炮弹突然袭击而来，教师办公室和一年级教室、学生宿舍等都被打坏，学生张昆明、郑安光等三人先后被打得血肉模糊。在弹片纷飞中，奋勇抢救受伤学生的教师丘继意，也被接踵而来的美制炮弹打伤。刚考上厦门医学院的华侨黄友义的独生儿子黄金，这天欢天喜地从医学院注册回来向母亲报喜，想不到在途中就被蒋贼军的空中爆炸炮弹打死。江头小学四年级学生陈亚兴和他的妹妹陈佳治两人，在帮助农业社饲猪的时候，也被突然飞来的蒋军炮弹打伤和打死了。带了妻子到工地上参加铺自来水管工程的洪尧盾，当场被蒋军炮弹打伤，当他看到他的妻子张曲富被蒋军炮弹拦腰打成两段的惨状时，悲愤地说：“美帝国主义和蒋匪帮，害得我好惨，只要我不死，我一定要报仇。”
    在美帝国主义指使下，蒋介石匪帮这一新的血腥罪行，激起了江头乡和厦门市人民的无限愤怒。厦门第三中学全校师生、江头乡各村人民，纷纷举行控诉大会，一致保证要化悲愤为力量，用加紧生产和积极支前等实际行动，支援人民解放军解放金门、台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，为死难和受伤的同胞报仇雪恨。第三中学学生、纠察大队副队长王声亮说：我亲自参加抢救和收埋了受难的同学，我永远不会忘记杀死杀伤我们同学的炮弹是美国制造和美国军舰远洋运来的，是美帝国主义妄图在台湾海峡地区扩大侵略范围后欠下的一笔血债。我除了保证做好纠察工作、把功课学好，还要在祖国需要的时候，拿枪上前线痛击敌人，为死伤的同学和同胞讨还这笔血债。儿子被打伤、女儿被打死的五一农业社副业生产组长陈辉群愤怒地说：“血债一定要用血来还，我一定要以最坚决的行动，来支援人民解放军解放金门、台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，粉碎美帝国主义任何侵略阴谋，为我的大儿子和大女儿报仇。”
