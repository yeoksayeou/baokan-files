Xinhua News Agency, September 7th, TASS Cairo, September 7th: Iraqi Republic Foreign Minister Jamil was received by United Arab Republic President Nasser in Cairo on the 6th, and held a two-hour conversation with him.

Jamil told reporters from the Middle East News Agency that he will discuss with UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld in Baghdad ways to implement the resolution passed by the UN General Assembly emergency special session based on the Arab countries' proposal. Jamil said: "The Republic of Iraq demands that the United States and British troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan."

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, September 9th: Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamil told reporters at Baghdad Airport on the 8th, while seeing off UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld: The Iraqi government clearly expressed its attitude to Hammarskjöld: the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Middle East is the primary and immediate step to be taken. This step is a prerequisite for the United Nations to take further measures to maintain peace in the region.

Jamil added: "Hammarskjöld's visit has given Prime Minister Qassem and the Iraqi government the opportunity to have face-to-face contact with the UN Secretary-General, and to discuss the UN's Middle East resolution intimately." He said that the Iraqi government discussed the general world situation, especially the situation in the Middle East, with Hammarskjöld.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 7th: According to the Bulgarian News Agency, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Lukanov told reporters from the Bulgarian News Agency that there will be no peace in the world as long as the US and British troops remain in Lebanon and Jordan. He firmly demanded that the US and UK implement the resolution of the UN General Assembly emergency special session and immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The people of the world expect the United Nations to do this, and therefore the primary responsibility of the upcoming 13th session of the UN General Assembly is to live up to this hope of the people of the world.

Lukanov said that the next session of the UN General Assembly should also make every effort and pass resolutions that can break the deadlock in disarmament negotiations. He said that the United Nations should no longer evade the issue of immediate and universal cessation of nuclear weapon tests, a matter of great significance to the people of all countries.

    伊拉克外长贾迈尔指出
　　美英军队应立即撤出中东
　　保外长要求美英遵守联合国大会决议
    据新华社7日讯　塔斯社开罗7日讯：伊拉克共和国外交部长贾迈尔6日在开罗受到阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔的接见，并且同他进行了两小时的谈话。
    贾迈尔对中东通讯社记者说，他将在巴格达同联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德讨论实现联合国大会紧急特别会议根据阿拉伯国家提案通过的决议的办法。贾迈尔说：“伊拉克共和国要求美国和英国军队立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退”。
    新华社巴格达9日电　伊拉克外交部长贾迈尔8日在巴格达机场送别联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德时对记者们说：伊拉克政府很明白地向哈马舍尔德表示了它的态度：外国军队撤出中东是首要的并且是立刻要采取的步骤。这个步骤是联合国进一步采取措施来维护这个地区的和平的先决条件。
    贾迈尔又说：“哈马舍尔德的访问使卡塞姆总理和伊拉克政府有机会同联合国秘书长进行当面的接触，并且可以亲密地讨论联合国的中东决议。”他说，伊拉克政府同哈马舍尔德讨论了一般的世界局势，特别是中东局势。
    新华社索非亚7日电　据保加利亚通讯社报道，保加利亚外交部长卢卡诺夫对保加利亚通讯社记者说，只要美英两国军队留在黎巴嫩和约旦，世界就不会安宁。他坚决要求美英两国执行联合国大会紧急特别会议的决议，立即把它们的军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出去。全世界人民都期待联合国做到这一点，因此即将召开的联合国大会第十三届会议的首要职责就是不辜负世界人民的这一希望。
    卢卡诺夫说，联合国大会下届会议还应该尽一切努力并且通过一些能够打开裁军谈判僵局的决议。他说，联合国不应该再回避像立即普遍停止核武器试验这样一个对各国人民具有重大意义的问题。
