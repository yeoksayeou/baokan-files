    Oppose the "Four Fears" Ideology, Achieve Three-Way Satisfaction
    Hebei Commercial Departments Launch Large-Scale Purchase and Sales Campaign

    (Our Dispatch) To adapt to the new situation of a great agricultural harvest, Hebei Province is about to launch a mass large-scale purchase and sales campaign throughout the province to ensure that the purchase of agricultural products is done with more acquisition, faster acquisition, good acquisition, and sufficient acquisition; the supply of industrial products must strive to organize sources of goods in every possible way and try to meet the needs of rural areas for production and living materials. This was decided by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee at a recent joint financial and economic conference.

    Hebei Province's current autumn crops are growing unprecedentedly well, and a great agricultural harvest is a foregone conclusion. It is estimated that the province's output of grain, cotton, oilseeds, live pigs, and several local specialties will increase by more than double compared to last year. Due to the high socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, there is an urgent demand to expand reproduction, and they will surely sell surplus grain and other agricultural products in large quantities to exchange for agricultural production materials, engage in large-scale capital construction, and realize mechanization and electrification. In response to this new situation, the meeting pointed out that carrying out large-scale purchases and sales and supporting production and meeting the needs of the people through expanding commodity circulation is the fundamental task of commercial work. All commercial activities must be carried out around this center. The commercial departments must actively purchase all products that agricultural cooperatives request to sell. It is necessary to educate the staff of the province's financial and trade departments to recognize that doing a good job in the purchase of agricultural products is a concrete manifestation of political viewpoint, production viewpoint, and mass viewpoint. Therefore, financial and trade departments must concentrate their main efforts, overcome all difficulties in every possible way, and purchase all agricultural, sideline, and local specialty products that people's communes and agricultural cooperatives want to sell in a timely manner, at the fastest speed, with the greatest effort and energy, to achieve satisfaction for the state, agricultural cooperatives, and members. It is strictly necessary to prevent the "Four Fears" ideology (fear of concentrated acquisition, fear of difficulties in storage, fear of losses, fear of overstocking) from existing among cadres and prevent a situation of non-active acquisition, so that all staff members can muster enough energy and devote themselves to the campaign.

    The meeting pointed out that because this year's acquisition task is large and the time for agricultural cooperatives to sell is concentrated, while the peak purchasing season is also the busy agricultural season for autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and large-scale deep plowing, when labor is most strained, the acquisition work must rely on the people's communes and agricultural cooperatives and adopt the method of the mass line. Commercial departments should send purchasing agents and technicians to agricultural cooperatives to adopt the "Four On-Site" method of acquisition: on-site inspection, on-site weighing, on-site payment, and on-site storage, and where conditions permit, they can also organize agricultural cooperatives for on-site processing. For processing and warehousing issues, all localities should rely on the masses and adopt a method of mainly using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods to increase processing and warehousing equipment.

    With the bumper harvest of agricultural and sideline products this year, it is estimated that rural purchasing power will increase by about 40% compared to last year. After the income of agricultural cooperatives increases, they will inevitably require the supply of a considerable amount of production and living materials, especially various machines and capital construction materials. In order to adapt to this new demand in rural areas, the meeting pointed out that commercial departments must make every effort to do a good job in large-scale purchases and sales. First, it is necessary to increase sources of goods in every possible way, fully rely on local industry, handicrafts, and agricultural cooperatives, tap production potential, and increase production. To this end, commercial departments must vigorously assist all parties, actively collect and supply raw materials, organize production collaboration between departments, factories, and regions, and guarantee the sale of all products. For products that can be produced in large quantities locally, such as locally produced chemical fertilizers, locally produced pesticides, small and medium-sized power machinery, sweet potato slicers, deep plows, etc., efforts should be made to assist production departments in increasing production and strive for self-sufficiency. For sulfuric acid, activated carbon, silicon steel sheets, etc., which have been successfully trial-produced in some areas, experience should be actively promoted, and for those that production departments are temporarily unable to produce, commercial departments should actively organize demonstrative production according to needs to create experience and vigorously promote it. Second, it is necessary to fully tap the potential of existing materials and adjust them mutually.

    For the supply of living materials, in addition to commodities supplied under state plans and under controlled supply, general daily-use industrial products must be vigorously promoted and supplied freely. In terms of goods distribution, general industrial products are required to give priority to supporting rural areas.

    In order to ensure that large-scale purchases and sales are done well and to further promote the leap forward development of industry and agriculture, the meeting emphasized that politics must take command and mass movements must be carried out on a large scale. Party committees at all levels must earnestly strengthen their leadership over financial and economic work and include the unified arrangement of production work and financial and economic work on their agendas. All localities should also, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, carry out large-scale socialist collaboration between regions and between departments and support each other.

### 反对“四怕”思想　做到三方满意  河北商业部门开展大购大销运动

    反对“四怕”思想　做到三方满意
    河北商业部门开展大购大销运动
    本报讯　适应农业大丰收的新形势，河北省即将在全省范围内开展一个群众性的大购大销运动，保证农产品的收购工作作到多收、快收、收好、收足；工业品的供应工作，作到千方百计地组织货源，尽量满足农村对生产资料和生活资料的需要。这是中共河北省委和省人民委员会最近联合召开的财经会议决定的。
    河北省目前秋苗生长空前良好，农业大丰收已成定局，预计全省粮食、棉花、油料、生猪以及若干土特产品的产量，都将比去年增加一倍以上。广大农民由于社会主义觉悟和生产积极性高涨，迫切要求扩大再生产，势必踊跃地大量出售余粮和其他农产品，用以换取农业生产资料，大搞基本建设，实现机械化电气化。针对这种新形势，会议指出：开展大购大销，通过扩大商品流通来支持生产和满足人民需要，是商业工作的根本任务。一切商业活动都必须围绕这个中心来进行，凡农业社要求出售的产品，商业部门都要积极收购起来。必须教育全省财贸部门工作人员认识到作好农产品的收购工作，就是政治观点、生产观点、群众观点的具体体现。因此，财贸部门必须集中主要力量，千方百计地克服一切困难，把人民公社、农业社要出售的一切农副土特产品，用最快的速度、花最大的力量和干劲，及时全部收购起来，达到国家、农业社和社员三满意。严格防止干部中存在“四怕”思想（怕收购集中、怕保管困难、怕损失、怕积压），出现不积极收购的情况，使全体工作人员鼓足干劲，投入运动。
    会议指出：由于今年收购任务大，农业社出售的时间又集中，而采购旺季正是秋收、秋种、大搞深翻土地的农忙季节，劳动力最紧张，因此收购工作必须依靠人民公社、农业社，采取群众路线的方法进行。商业部门要派出采购员、技术员，深入到农业社，采取就社验级、就社过秤、就社付款、就社保管的“四就”办法收购，有条件的还可以组织农业社就地加工。对于加工、仓储问题，各地要依靠群众，采取以土法为主，土洋并举的办法来增加加工、仓储设备。
    随着今年农副产品的丰收，预计农村购买力将比去年增长40％左右。农业社收入增多后，必然要求供给数量相当大的生产资料和生活资料，特别是各种机器和基本建设物资。为了适应农村这个新的要求，会议指出商业部门必须全力做好大购大销。首先要千方百计地增加货源，要充分依靠地方工业、手工业、农业社，挖掘生产潜力，增加生产。为此，商业部门必须大力协助各方，积极搜集、供应原材料，组织部门、厂际、地区间的生产协作，包销全部产品。对当地能够大量生产的产品，如土制化肥、土制农药、中小型动力机械、薯类切片机、深耕犁等，要大力协助生产部门增产，力争自给自足。对一些地区已试制成功的硫酸、活性炭、矽钢片等，要积极推广经验，对生产部门暂时无力生产的，商业部门要根据需要，积极组织示范性的生产，以创造经验，大力推广。其次，要充分挖掘现有物资的潜力，互相调剂。
    生活资料的供应工作，除国家计划供应和控制供应的商品外，一般日用工业品必须大力推销，放手供应。货源分配上，一般工业品要求优先支援农村。
    为了保证做好大购大销，进一步促进工农业的飞跃发展，会议强调指出必须政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。各地党委要切实加强对财经工作的领导，把生产工作和财经工作统一安排列入议事日程。各地还要在党委的统一领导下，开展地区之间、部门之间的社会主义大协作，互相支援。
