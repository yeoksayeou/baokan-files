The "Ceasefire" Conspiracy Cannot Deceive People
Wen Jiasi

Since the resumption of the Sino-US talks in Warsaw, the Chinese people and the people of the world have been greatly concerned about these talks, hoping to find an effective way to ease the tense situation in the Taiwan region created by the US aggressors. However, the US side is using the Sino-US talks to play a "ceasefire" conspiracy, attempting to shirk the responsibility for creating the tense situation in the Taiwan region and to cover up the aggressive activities of the United States in continuing to prepare for war in the Taiwan region, which we absolutely cannot tolerate.

There is no war between China and the United States, so where does the talk of a "ceasefire" come from? As for the Chinese people's punitive strikes against the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique entrenched on the islands of Jinmen and Mazu, that is an internal matter of our country, and no one can interfere. The reason for the current tense situation in the Taiwan region is precisely because a small group of American warmongers are constantly interfering in our country's internal affairs and infringing upon our country's territorial sovereignty there. If it were not for the long-term protection and support of the Chiang Kai-shek clique by US imperialism, Taiwan and the coastal islands of Fujian would have been liberated long ago, and there would be no tense situation in the Taiwan Strait region today. Therefore, the current problem is not a "ceasefire," but that the United States must stop playing with fire, that is to say, the US armed forces must immediately withdraw from Taiwan; only in this way can the tense situation in the Taiwan region be completely eliminated. Conversely, if the United States continues to interfere in our country's internal affairs, occupy our Taiwan, and prevent us from liberating Jinmen and Mazu, then the tense situation in the Taiwan region cannot be eliminated. The US request for a "ceasefire" is essentially asking the Chinese people to give up their sacred right to liberate their own territory and allow the United States to continue to occupy these areas in order to achieve the goal of invading mainland China. The US aggressors are playing the "ceasefire" conspiracy in order to deceive the people of the world, attempting to use the "ceasefire" proposal to cover up their true face of aggression by taking advantage of the anxieties of some people in the world about war. However, the wolfish ambitions of US imperialism have now been nakedly exposed before the world and cannot deceive the people of the world, let alone the Chinese people.

Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan have always been Chinese territory; the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory and realization of the reunification of the motherland is the common and great will of the 600 million Chinese people, which no one can stop. The era of imperialism dominating the world is gone forever. The Chinese people who have stood up cannot be intimidated or defeated. Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people are engaged in the construction of their motherland with unparalleled power. In the construction cause, the Chinese people can make high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way. The Chinese people will certainly be able to defeat the enemy in the sacred battle to defend the motherland, leaving them in utter defeat.

The American aggressors should be warned once again: Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement expresses the steel-like strong will of the 600 million Chinese people; we must liberate Taiwan! US armed forces must get out of Taiwan!

    “停火”的阴谋骗不了人
    闻家驷
    自从华沙中美会谈恢复以来，中国人民和全世界的人民都对这次会谈予以莫大的关怀，希望通过会谈能够找到一个缓和台湾地区由美国侵略者一手造成的紧张局势的有效办法，但是美国方面却利用中美会谈，玩弄“停火”阴谋，企图以此来推卸制造台湾地区紧张局势的责任，并掩盖美国在台湾地区继续进行备战的侵略活动，这是我们所绝对不能容忍的。
    中美之间并没有打仗，“停火”之说又从何而来呢？至于中国人民对盘踞在金门、马祖等岛屿上的蒋介石卖国集团进行惩罚性的打击，那是我们国家内部的问题，任何人都不能过问。而目前台湾地区之所以出现紧张局面，却正是由于一小撮美国战争贩子在那里继续不断地干涉我国的内政，侵犯我国的领土主权。如果不是美帝国主义长期以来对蒋介石集团的庇护和支持，台湾和福建沿海岛屿早已解放了，而今天在台湾海峡地区也就不会发生局势紧张的问题了。因此，目前的问题，不是什么“停火”，而是美国必须停止玩火，也就是说美国武装部队必须立即从台湾撤出去；只有这样，才能彻底消除目前台湾地区的紧张局势。相反地，如果美国继续干涉我国的内政，霸占我们的台湾，阻止我们去解放金门、马祖，那么，台湾地区的紧张局势也就消除不了。美国向我们提出“停火”的要求，这个要求实质上就是要中国人民放弃解放自己的领土的神圣的权利，而让美国继续霸占这些地区，以达到侵略中国大陆的目的。美国侵略者玩弄“停火”阴谋，还为了欺骗世界人民。企图利用世界上一部分人对于战争的忧虑心理，用“停火”建议来掩盖自己的侵略真面目。但是，美帝国主义的狼子野心，今天已经在全世界面前赤裸裸地暴露出来了，骗不了全世界的人民，更骗不了中国人民。
    金门、马祖和台湾，从来就是中国的领土；中国人民解放自己的领土，实现祖国的统一，这是中国六亿人民共同的伟大的意志，决不是什么人可以阻挡得住的。帝国主义称雄称霸的时代已经一去不复返了。站起来了的中国人民是吓不倒也是打不倒的。今天中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，正在以无比强大的威力从事祖国的建设，中国人民在建设事业中，能使高山低头，河水让路，中国人民也必定能够在保卫祖国的神圣的战斗中，把敌人杀得落花流水，片甲不归。
    应该再一次警告美国侵略者：陈毅外长的声明表达了中国六亿人民钢铁般坚强的意志；我们一定要解放台湾！美国武装力量必须从台湾滚出去！
