    On Layout Adjustments
    Starting today, the layout of this newspaper will be adjusted as follows: Page one will feature important news; page two, industry, transportation, and commerce; page three, agriculture; page four, international and domestic important news; page five, international news; page six, politics and culture; page seven, theory and academics; page eight, supplement.
    To strengthen theoretical propaganda, this newspaper has established a Theoretical Propaganda Department, responsible for theoretical and academic publicity and reporting. We hope that the broad readership and authors will give us more help in this regard. The original Domestic Politics Department and Culture and Education Department have been merged into a Political and Cultural Education Department to adapt to the new work needs.

    关于版面的调整
    自今日起，本报版面作如下调整：一版刊登要闻，二版工业、交通和商业，三版农业，四版国际和国内要闻，五版国际，六版政治和文教，七版理论和学术，八版副刊。
    为加强理论宣传，本报设立理论宣传部，负责理论和学术的宣传报道。希望广大读者和作者在这方面多多给予我们帮助。原国内政治部和文教部合并为政治文教部，以适应新的工作需要。
