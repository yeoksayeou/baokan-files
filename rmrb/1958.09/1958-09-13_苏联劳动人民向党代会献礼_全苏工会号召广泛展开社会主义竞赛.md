    Soviet Working People Present Gifts to the Party Congress
    All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions Calls for Widespread Socialist Emulation
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: According to TASS, the Presidium of the All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions' resolution on launching a socialist emulation drive to greet the 21st (Extraordinary) Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union points out that the important task of trade union organizations at all levels is to widely explain the historical significance of the upcoming Party Congress among the masses. Trade union organizations at all levels should mobilize the working people to widely launch a socialist emulation drive, striving for each enterprise, workshop, work section, and team to fulfill and overfulfill the state's plans, and striving to complete the construction plans of the chemical and metallurgical industries ahead of schedule, as well as completing housing construction and cultural and welfare construction plans ahead of schedule.
    The resolution also states that trade union committees at all levels should organize all staff and workers of enterprises, workshops, work sections, and teams to put forward specific guarantees in terms of completing and overfulfilling production tasks, increasing labor productivity, saving raw materials, improving product quality, and reducing product costs. The fulfillment of these guarantees by each collective and each worker will be the best gift from the working people of the whole country to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
