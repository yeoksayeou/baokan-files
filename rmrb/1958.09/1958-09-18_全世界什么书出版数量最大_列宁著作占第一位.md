Xinhua News Agency, London, September 15th: According to TASS, London, September 15th: Currently, no book in the world has been translated more than Lenin's works. In terms of book publication, Lenin's works have replaced the Bible and taken the first place.

This was mentioned by Fielding Clarke, a scientist at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom, in his speech at the "Modern Church Activities Conference" held in Oxford on September 11th.

Clarke then pointed out that the majority of the world's residents are concerned about the fact that "the former Russia, which was once poor, industrially backward, and largely illiterate, has today greatly improved the living standards of its people, eliminated illiteracy, and massively developed healthcare, especially in the Central Asian republics, which have achieved astonishing progress."

    全世界什么书出版数量最大
    列宁著作占第一位
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社伦敦15日讯：目前在全世界范围内没有任何书籍的翻译能比列宁著作的翻译更多。列宁的著作在书籍的出版上已经代替圣经而占了第一位。
    这是英国设菲尔德大学科学工作者菲尔丁·克拉克9月11日在牛津举行的“现代教会活动会议”的讲话中谈到的。
    克拉克接着指出，世界上大多数居民关心这一事实：“以前曾经是生活贫困、工业落后、文盲很多的俄国，今天人民大大地提高了生活水平，消灭了文盲现象，大规模地发展了卫生保健事业，特别是中亚细亚各共和国的发展中达到了惊人的成就。”
