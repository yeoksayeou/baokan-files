Xinhua News Agency, Poenmus, September 1st: The 90th annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress opened here today. One thousand delegates are participating in the meeting in this seaside city amidst the tense international situation, the escalating danger of war, and the threats of rising unemployment and deteriorating living conditions. It appears that the two main issues facing the meeting are: condemning the British government's policy of building up nuclear armaments and allowing American missile bases; and opposing the government's attempt to forcibly restrict wages in order to transfer the consequences of the economic crisis onto the workers.

Many local trade unions have put forward demands for the government to change its nuclear war policy. Although these demands have been vigorously diluted by the right-wing leadership of the Trades Union Congress, they are still reflected in a comprehensive proposal submitted for discussion at the meeting. The proposal states that the British Trades Union Congress "is seriously disturbed by the dangerous situation created in the world by the continuous development of weapons of mass destruction; and believes that the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and the fact that patrol aircraft are ready to use these weapons immediately against imagined war dangers deepens suspicion and creates the danger of war occurring by accident. It (the Trades Union Congress) specifically believes that the establishment of bases in (Britain) that can launch such weapons is a serious threat to the safety of the British people and constitutes an obstacle to world peace."

The proposal demands: "First, opposition to the manufacture of nuclear weapons in this country and also to the launching of these weapons from British territory by any other country; Second, opposition to the rearmament of the German (West German) Federal Defence Force with nuclear weapons."

The meeting expressed serious concern about the British economic situation.

Even the Chairman of the Trades Union Congress, Tom Yates, warned in his opening speech today: "Unemployment is looming ominously. From all indications, the government is determined to adopt a ruthless approach, resulting in higher unemployment figures than at any time since the war. Making people wander the streets: this has once again become a deliberate national policy."

Yates emphasized: "Reduced employment opportunities, stagnant production, and high prices: all this is ample reason for the trade unions not to believe that the government will take actions that are in the national interest."

The comprehensive proposal recommends that the congress reject the government's economic policy because this policy aims to reduce workers' wages and living standards.

The proposal recommends that the congress ensure that it strives to establish a government whose current goal is to establish a planned economy, thereby guaranteeing full employment and a continuously improving standard of living for the country's workers.

Another proposal advocates "significantly reducing military expenditure" because such expenditure is "undermining our (British) economic foundation and subjecting the country to great danger."

The Trades Union Congress annual meeting announced today that the Trades Union Congress has a total membership of eight million, three hundred and thirty-seven thousand, an increase of thirty-two thousand since the last annual meeting.

　　英国工人日益不满政府政策
    职工大会年会反映群众反对核备战的强烈情绪
    据新华社菩恩穆斯1日电　英国职工大会第九十届年会今天在这里开幕。有一千名代表在国际局势紧张、战争危险加剧以及在失业人数增加、生活条件恶化的威胁下，在这个海滨城市参加会议。看来会议面临的两个主要问题是：谴责英国政府建立核军备和美国导弹基地的政策；反对政府企图强行限制工资以便把经济危机的后果转嫁到工人身上。
    许多地方工会已经提出了要政府改变核战争政策的要求。这些要求虽然经过职工大会的右翼领导机构竭力冲淡，但是仍然反映在提交会议讨论的一个综合提案上。提案说，英国职工大会“对由于大规模毁灭性工具的不断发展而在世界上产生的危险局势感到严重的不安；并且相信：储存核武器以及巡逻飞机随时都可以立即使用这些武器以对付想像中的战争危险的这种情况加深了猜疑，并且造成由于偶然事件而发生战争的危险。它（职工大会）特别认为，在（英国）这个国家建立可以发射这种武器的基地，是对英国人民的安全的严重威胁，并且构成对世界和平的障碍。”
    提案要求：“第一，反对这个国家制造核武器，也反对其他任何国家从英国领土上发射这些武器；第二，反对用核武器重新武装德国（西德）联邦国防军。”
    会议对英国经济情况表示严重的不安。
    甚至是职工大会主席托姆·耶茨今天在会上致开幕词的时候都提出警告说：“失业阴森森地逼近。从一切迹象看来，政府决心采取冷酷无情的方针，使失业人数比战后任何时候都要多。使人们流浪街头：这已经再次成为国家故意采取的政策”。
    耶茨着重指出：“就业机会减少，生产停滞，物价高昂：这一切都是工会不相信政府会采取符合民族利益的行动的充分根据。”
    综合提案建议大会拒绝政府的经济政策，因为这种政策是要降低工人的工资和生活水平。
    提案建议大会保证为建立这样一个政府而努力，这个政府当前的目标是建立有计划的经济，从而保证这个国家的工人充分就业和不断提高生活水平。
    另一项提案主张“大大缩减军事开支”，因为这种开支正在“破坏我们（英国）的经济基础，使国家遭受巨大的危险”。
    职工大会年会今天宣布，职工大会共有会员一千八百三十三万七千人，比上届年会开会时增加了三万二千人。
