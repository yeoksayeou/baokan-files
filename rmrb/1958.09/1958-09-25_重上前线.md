    Back to the Front Lines
    Kuang Yuze, Leader of the Fourth Company, Fengjie County Steel Assault Regiment

    I am a demobilized soldier, a Communist Party member. I once fiercely fought the American devils on the Korean front and was commended for my service. Now I am back on the front lines, fighting for steel!

    When the Party Branch Secretary of our township told me that I was being transferred to the steel front, I was very excited. I understood the important meaning of the Party's slogan "Fight for Steel." I must not fail the Party's trust and education; I must strive to complete the task the Party has given me. Although some people say that the working and living conditions of steelworkers are very harsh, is this any more difficult than fighting hand-to-hand with the enemy on the front lines? Difficulties cannot scare a Communist Party member and a tested revolutionary fighter. Although my parents, both in their seventies, were reluctant to let their youngest son leave home, and my loving mother even cried and tried to persuade me to stay, they could not stop my determination. I bid farewell to my elderly parents and my fiancée, and reported to the county.

    We fifteen hundred demobilized soldiers formed the Steel Assault Regiment, led by the County Military Service Bureau Director as the regimental commander and the County Party Secretary as the political commissar. I was honorably appointed as the leader of the Fourth Company. More than six hundred of us were gathered in the first batch. After studying and in-depth discussions, our determination became even stronger and our confidence even higher. We beat gongs and drums to send a letter of determination to the County Party Committee, guaranteeing that we would truly play a vanguard role on the steel front and fight a beautiful battle.

    Now we have arrived on the steel front. Our Second Battalion is participating in the capital construction work for the expansion of the iron smelting plant. Some are carrying limestone in the blast furnace workshop, some are carrying iron sand in the foundry workshop, and some are rushing to build dormitories. Here, life is indeed a bit worse; for example, the dormitories are very crowded. But we know that these are only temporary difficulties, and a bright and beautiful future must be created by our own hands. Moreover, compared with the situation on the Korean front back then, this is really nothing! We are still not discouraged and are still working enthusiastically. Our Fourth Company is responsible for carrying limestone. We work almost twelve hours a day, and many comrades' shoulders are red, swollen, and peeling. However, the work rate continues to rise. Now we have increased from carrying twenty-three loads per person per day to forty-five loads per person per day. Because there are many mountains here and transportation is inconvenient, the iron cannot be quickly sent to the trucks for transportation. We also took the initiative to propose carrying the iron out on the way back after carrying limestone. We are determined to ensure that the No. 2 blast furnace, which is under construction, is completed as soon as possible and produces iron as soon as possible.

    We never forget that we are demobilized soldiers. We will continue to maintain and carry forward the glorious fighting traditions of the People's Army and become shock troops of the Party on all fronts. If the Party wants to transfer us to be iron smelting workers, we are also determined to improve our education and master the technology. We must fight the enemy to the end on the steel front!

    重上前线
    奉节县钢铁突击团第四连连长  匡玉泽
    我是一个复员军人，一个共产党员。我曾经在朝鲜前线狠狠打击过美国鬼子，立过功；现在我又重上前线，为钢铁而战斗了。
    当我们乡的党总支书记告诉我要调我上钢铁战线的时候，我兴奋得很。我懂得党提出的“为钢而战”的战斗口号的重要意义。我决不能辜负党对我的信任和教养，一定要努力完成党交给我的任务。虽然有人说钢铁工人的工作和生活的条件都很艰苦，但是难道这会比在前线和敌人肉搏更艰苦吗？困难是吓唬不了共产党员和经过考验的革命战士的。虽然我的七十多岁的双亲舍不得我这个么儿离开家，慈爱的妈妈还哭着挽留我，但也挡不住我的决心。我告别了年老的父母，告别了未婚妻，就上县里报到了。
    我们一千五百名复员军人组成了钢铁突击团，由县兵役局长担任团长，县委书记担任政委，我光荣地被任命为第四连连长。我们第一批集中的有六百多人。经过学习和深入讨论以后，我们的决心更大，信心更高。我们敲锣打鼓到县委会送了决心书，保证在钢铁战线上真正发挥突击作用，打一场漂亮仗。
    现在我们已经来到钢铁前线上了。我们二营参加炼铁厂扩建的基本建设工作，有的在高炉车间挑石灰石，有的在翻砂车间挑铁砂，有的在赶修宿舍。在这里，生活确是比较差一些，譬如宿舍吧，就挤得很；但是我们知道这只是暂时的困难，光明美丽的远景是要我们用双手去创造的。何况这同当年朝鲜战线上的情况相比，实在算不得什么苦呢！我们仍然毫不气馁，仍然热火朝天地干着。我们四连是挑石灰石的，每天差不多要工作十二小时，许多同志的肩头都挑得红肿脱皮了；但是工作率却仍不断上升，现在我们已由每人每天挑二十三回提高到每人每天挑四十五回了。由于这里山多交通不方便，铁不能很快送上汽车运出去，我们又主动提出在挑石灰石的回头路上把铁挑出去，我们一心要使正在兴建的二号高炉早日建成，早点出铁。
    我们时刻没有忘记自己是复员军人。我们将继续保持和发扬人民军队的光荣的战斗传统，成为党在各个战线上的突击手。如果党要调我们去当炼铁工人，我们也有决心提高文化，掌握技术。我们一定要在钢铁战线上和敌人战斗到底！
