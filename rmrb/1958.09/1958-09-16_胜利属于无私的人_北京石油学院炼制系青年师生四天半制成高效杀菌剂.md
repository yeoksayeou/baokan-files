Victory Belongs to the Selfless
Young Teachers and Students of the Refining Department of the Beijing Petroleum Institute Successfully Develop Highly Effective Bactericide in Four and a Half Days
    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Fu Jun reports: A competition culminated in victory after four and a half days of hard work by a group of young teachers and students from the Refining Department of the Beijing Petroleum Institute.
    Not long ago, the Refining Department of the Beijing Petroleum Institute accepted an urgent task from the Beijing People’s Hospital to trial-produce a highly effective bactericide, requiring its successful development in a very short period. Upon hearing this news, several fourth-year students requested to collaborate with a professor on the trial production. The professor found it difficult to directly refuse such a legitimate request from the students, so she devised a clever plan to tie the hands of the masses: students could participate in the trial production, but they could only do what they were told. As for how to do it and why, the students were not allowed to know.
    The students once again requested to participate in and understand the entire trial production process.
    The professor replied, "Let me consider it for an hour..."
    An hour later, the professor came out and told the students, "You are in petroleum. This is medicinal chemistry. You will not participate." She also added a "reason": the time is too tight, and it is difficult to complete on schedule.
    The students were infuriated by the professor's extreme selfishness: "Is it impossible without you?" The students decided to form a "Youth Shock Brigade" to compete with the professor. Their members included nine fourth-year students, three second-year students, three students from the Workers and Peasants' Quick Literacy Middle School who had just entered the university a few days earlier, and three young teaching assistants. The students' actions were supported by the general Party branch of the department.
    The news reached the professor. The professor's first thought was to prevent anyone from leaking her research secrets. In her laboratory, the labels with the names of the medicines on the medicine bottles were suddenly replaced with numbers, such as number one, number two... and her assistant—a member of the Communist Youth League—was no longer allowed to participate in her research.
    The trial production of the "Youth Shock Brigade" was proceeding intensely. However, the progress of the trial production was not so smooth, and the experimental work on the first day all failed. They examined the work of that day and learned two lessons: First, the idea of blindly believing in literature had not been completely broken. They had spent too much effort flipping through foreign literature that day, resulting in very little gain. Second, the idea of blindly believing in bourgeois professors was still deeply rooted. The experiments were carried out only according to the professor's old methods in the past, without bold originality. The next day, they redeployed their forces, changed the original experimental conditions, and decided to increase the temperature and concentration, using several different methods simultaneously. After several sleepless nights, the main link in the highly effective bactericide—the condensation experiment—was finally successful. Once the key problem was broken through, the four types of highly effective bactericides commissioned by the Beijing People's Hospital were successfully produced in four and a half days.
    The professor, who was still searching for "treasure" in the literature, had not produced even one highly effective bactericide in more than ten days. When the students asked her to come and see the four highly effective bactericides they had successfully produced, she sneered and said, "Isn't it with Professor Tian's help!" She said it with such certainty. However, Professor Tian told her, "I only found out just now."

    胜利属于无私的人
    北京石油学院炼制系青年师生四天半制成高效杀菌剂
    本报讯　记者傅军报道：一场竞赛经过北京石油学院炼制系一群青年师生四天半苦战，终于得到了胜利。
    不久前，北京石油学院炼制系接受了北京人民医院一项试制高效杀菌剂的紧急任务，要求在很短时间内就要试制成功。四年级的几个学生知道这个消息后，就要求和一位教授合作来试制。对于学生们提出的这种正当的要求，教授是不好干脆拒绝的，她想了一条捆住群众手脚的妙计：学生要参加试制也可以，但只能叫做什么就做什么，至于怎样做和为什么要这样做，学生们是不准知道的。
    学生们再一次提出参加和了解全部试制工作的要求。
    这位教授回答说：“让我考虑一小时……”
    一小时后，教授出来回答学生说：“你们是搞石油的，这是药物化学，你们不参加了。”同时还附加了一条“理由”：时间太紧迫，按期完成有困难。
    学生们被这位教授的极端自私心激怒了：“难道没有你就不成？”学生们决定成立一个“青年突击队”来和这位教授进行一场竞赛。他们的成员是：九个四年级学生，三个二年级学生，三个几天前才刚跨进大学门的工农速成中学来的学生和三个青年助教。学生们的行动得到系党总支的支持。
    消息传到那位教授那里。教授首先想到的，是别让人泄露了她的研究秘密。在她的实验室里，药瓶上写有药名的标签突然被换上了一号、二号……的号码，她的助手——一个共青团员也不能再参加她的研究工作了。
    “青年突击队”的试制工作在紧张地进行着。但是，试制工作的进展并不那么顺利，头一天的试验工作全失败了。他们检查了这天的工作，得到两个教训：一是迷信文献的思想还没有彻底打破，那天曾用了过多的力量去翻外国文献，结果收获很小；二是迷信资产阶级教授的思想还根深蒂固，试验时只是按照那位教授过去老方法进行的，没有大胆独创。第二天他们重新部署了力量，改变了原来的实验条件，决定提高温度和浓度，用几种不同方法来同时进行。经过几个不眠之夜，高效杀菌剂的主要一环——缩合试验，终于成功了。关键问题一突破，北京人民医院委托他们试制的四种高效杀菌剂在四天半的时间内就都顺利地制成了。
    那位还在文献里查“宝”的教授，在十多天来，却连一种高效杀菌剂也没有制成。当学生们请她去看看他们试制成功的四种高效杀菌剂时，她却冷笑地说：“还不是田教授帮助的！”她说得那样肯定。可是田教授却告诉她：“我也是刚才知道的。”
