Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th: The Japan National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations held a meeting of its standing directors on the 4th and decided to accept the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to send a National Day celebration delegation to China, headed by Chairman Akira Kazami.

In his speech at the meeting, Kazami pointed out that the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait is a long-planned conspiracy by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and that if this tense situation continues, it will affect the world situation.

When talking about Japan-China relations, Kazami pointed out that the current world situation is a time of fierce struggle between anti-imperialist forces and imperialism. Japan-China relations are a part of the world situation. Therefore, we must take the above-mentioned point of view to clarify the root cause of the Kishida Nobusuke government's hostile policy towards China, which has led to the deterioration of Japan-China relations. Kazami pointed out that the continuation of the tense situation will hinder the realization of the normalization of Japan-China relations and the restoration of normal diplomatic relations.

Kazami then said that under such circumstances, he felt a great responsibility for leading a delegation to visit China. He expressed his willingness to do everything in his power to restore normal diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

　　风见章斥美国在远东挑衅
    他将率领代表团来我国访问
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本恢复日中邦交国民会议4日举行了常任理事会会议，决定接受中国人民外交学会的邀请，派遣以理事长风见章为团长的国庆节庆祝代表团前往中国。
    风见章在会上讲话时指出，台湾海峡的紧张局势是美国和蒋介石集团计划已久的阴谋，这种紧张局势如果继续下去，将影响世界局势。
    风见章在谈到日中关系时指出，目前世界形势是反帝力量对帝国主义进行激烈斗争的时候，日中关系是世界形势中的一部分，因此我们必须站在上述的观点，才能够把岸信介政府所以采取敌视中国的政策，以致使日中关系恶化的根本原因弄清楚。风见章指出，紧张局势继续下去，将阻碍实现日中关系正常化与正常邦交的恢复。
    风见章接着说，在这种形势下，他对率领代表团访问中国一事感到责任重大。他表示愿为恢复日中正常邦交而尽他的一切力量。
