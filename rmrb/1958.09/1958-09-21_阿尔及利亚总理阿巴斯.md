    Algerian Prime Minister Abbas

    The Algerian Provisional Government was declared established on the 19th. Ferhat Abbas, leader of the Algerian National Liberation Front, was appointed Prime Minister of the Provisional Government.

    Ferhat Abbas is one of the leaders of the Algerian national independence movement. Together with other leaders of the Algerian national independence movement, he led the Algerian people in their national independence struggle to break away from more than 120 years of French imperialist colonial rule.

    Abbas was born into an Arab family and is 59 years old this year. He used to be a pharmacist and holds a doctorate in pharmacology. He participated in newspaper work and political activities in his youth. He served as a city and provincial councilor. Shortly after the US-British forces landed in North Africa during World War II, he issued a declaration demanding the establishment of Algeria's own country and the election of its own parliament through universal suffrage. Later, he established the "Algerian Democratic Union of the Manifesto." In 1945, he was arrested by the French colonial authorities. After being released, he became a member of parliament.

    Abbas joined the Algerian National Liberation Front in April 1955. From 1956, he became a public figure of the Algerian National Liberation Front. On August 20, 1956, he was appointed as a member of the Algerian National Revolutionary Committee by the representative meeting of the Algerian National Revolutionary Council. In August 1957, he was elected by the Algerian National Revolutionary Committee as a member of the Unified Guidance and Executive Committee of the Algerian National Liberation Front. On June 16 this year, he led a delegation from the Algerian National Liberation Front to attend the North African Three-Nation (Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria) conference held in Tunis to discuss the Algerian issue.
