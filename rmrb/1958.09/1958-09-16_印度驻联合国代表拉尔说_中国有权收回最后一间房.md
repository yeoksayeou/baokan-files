Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th. Indian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Lall, stated during a broadcast address to an American television company on the 14th that the Taiwan and offshore islands issue is purely China's internal affair, and this issue is beyond the jurisdiction of the United Nations, and there is no reason for any foreign country to interfere.

Lall said he does not believe China has any territorial aims other than Taiwan and the offshore islands. He said that China's goal is to reclaim the last room in its house, and no one has the right to stop China from doing so. Lall said that India will raise the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations at the upcoming 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Lall pointed out that it is an abnormal situation that currently representing the 600 million Chinese people in the United Nations is "a small island whose rule is maintained by external forces and which would collapse tomorrow without it." He then emphasized that the issue of China's representation in the United Nations must be placed on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly.

    印度驻联合国代表拉尔说
    中国有权收回最后一间房
    新华社15日讯　纽约消息：印度常驻联合国代表拉尔14日在向一个美国电视公司发表广播演说时指出，台湾和沿海岛屿问题纯粹是中国的内政，这个问题是在联合国管辖之外的，而且外国没有任何理由可以干涉。
    拉尔说，他认为中国除了对于台湾和沿海岛屿以外没有任何领土目的。他说，中国的目标是收回它的房屋中的最后一个房间，没有人有权利阻止中国这样作。拉尔说，印度将在即将举行的联合国大会第十三届会议上提出恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利问题。拉尔指出，现在代替六亿中国人民在联合国出现的是“一个靠外力维持统治和离了它明天就会垮台的小岛”的传表，这是一种不正常的局面。他接着强调指出，必须把关于中国在联合国的代表权问题列入联合国大会的议程。
