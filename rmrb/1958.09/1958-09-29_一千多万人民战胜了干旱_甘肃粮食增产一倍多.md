The People's Daily, Lanzhou, September 28th.  Gansu Province's thirteen million people, after a year of hard struggle, have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest on the grain front.  The total grain output for the whole year is estimated to reach 20 billion jin, an increase of 1.4 times over last year.  The average grain availability per person in the province will be 1,540 jin.  With this, Gansu Province, which has always been short of grain, has begun to be prosperous in terms of grain. Now, people throughout the province, from cities to villages, are jubilantly celebrating this great victory on the grain production front.

According to the estimate of the Gansu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry based on the harvesting of 70% of the autumn grain in the Dingxi Special District and the threshing of autumn grain in other special districts, the total output of autumn grain will be at least 11.7 billion jin. Including the summer grain, the total grain output of the province this year can reach 20 billion jin, an increase of 11.5 billion jin over last year's 8.5 billion jin, a net increase of 135%; the yield per mu is 450 jin, an increase of 230 jin over last year, a net increase of 104%. Among grain crops, there are 5 million mu with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, accounting for 10% of the grain sown area. In this way, Gansu Province has achieved the grain output targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program forty articles ahead of schedule in just one year, with an average of 1,540 jin of grain per person in the province.

At the beginning of this year, after the central government instructed to work hard for three years to change the face of the vast majority of regions, the people of Gansu, under the direct leadership of the provincial party committee, launched a revolution to seize grain from nature, and launched a decisive battle against drought, the most serious threat to agricultural production in Gansu.  They built large-scale water conservancy projects on the barren and drought-ridden land where mountainous areas account for 80% and the annual rainfall is only more than 300 millimeters. According to statistics as of August 15, the province has built 17.77 million mu of irrigated land, accounting for 116% of this year's plan. Calculated on the basis of the province's agricultural population, the average person now has 2.4 mu of irrigated land, which has basically eliminated the threat of drought.

Following the revolution to fight against nature, the people of Gansu launched a high tide of agricultural technology revolution. Up to now, more than 7 million new agricultural implements have been popularized throughout the province, which has improved work efficiency. Several key technical measures for increasing production, such as irrigation, fertilization, close planting, selection of improved varieties, soil improvement, and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, have been greatly improved this year.

At present, while Gansu Province is mobilizing a million-strong army to vigorously develop the iron and steel industry, 160,000 people are carrying out a shock program to divert the Tao River, and millions of troops are engaged in intensive autumn harvesting, they have also begun preparations for next year's production, including deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and preparation of improved seeds. They will work hard this winter, work hard next spring and summer, and build another 15 million mu of irrigated land. Accelerate the construction progress of the Tao River diversion project. Deep plow 30 million mu of land, and strive to become a province with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu.

    一千多万人民战胜了干旱
    甘肃粮食增产一倍多
    本报兰州28日电  甘肃省一千三百万人民，经过一年苦战，在粮食战线上已取得了前所未有的大丰收，今年全年粮食总产量可达二百亿斤，比去年增产一点四倍，全省平均每人可有粮食一千五百四十斤。至此，一向缺粮的甘肃省，在粮食方面已开始富裕了。现在，全省人民从城市到农村，都在欢欣鼓舞地庆祝粮食生产战线上这一巨大胜利。
    甘肃省农林厅根据已收成70％秋粮的定西专区和其他专区抽打秋粮情况的估计，秋粮总产量至少是一百一十七亿斤，连同夏粮计算，今年全省粮食总产量可达二百亿斤，总产量比去年的八十五亿斤增加一百一十五亿斤，净增率为135％；单产四百五十斤，比去年增加二百三十斤，净增为104％。粮食作物中，亩产千斤以上的共五百万亩，占粮食播种面积的10％。这样，甘肃省只一年时间，就提前实现了全国农业发展纲要四十条中规定的粮食产量指标，全省每人平均有粮食一千五百四十斤。
    今年初，中央指示苦战三年改变绝大多数地区面貌后，甘肃人民在省委的直接领导下，掀起了向大自然夺取粮食的革命，对威胁甘肃农业生产最严重的干旱展开了决战，在山地面积占80％、每年只有三百多公厘雨水的荒旱土上大修水利。截至8月15日的统计，全省已兴修水地一千七百七十七万亩，为今年计划的116％。按全省农业人口计算，现平均每人已有水地二点四亩，基本解除了干旱威胁。
    甘肃人民紧随着革大自然的命又掀起了农业技术革命的高潮，到目前为止，全省已推广新农具七百多万件，提高了工作效率。几种增产上最关键的技术措施如灌溉、施肥、密植、选用良种、土壤改良和防治病虫害等今年都有很大改进。
    目前，甘肃省人民在出动百万大军大办钢铁工业、十六万人突击引洮工程、数百万大军紧张秋收的同时，又开始明年生产的准备工作，包括深翻地、积肥和准备良种。他们将苦战今年一冬，大干明年一春一夏，再修水地一千五百万亩。加速引洮工程建设进度。深翻地三千万亩，努力争取成为亩产千斤省。
