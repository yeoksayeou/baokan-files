Concerning the launching of a nationwide transportation movement to solve the current transportation bottleneck, we already discussed this in yesterday's editorial. Now it is necessary to specifically discuss the issue of improving railway transportation efficiency. Railways are the transportation tool with the largest carrying capacity. Improving the efficiency of railway transportation is a crucial key to alleviating the current transportation strain. In August of this year, railway freight volume increased by 40% compared to the same period last year, which is already a significant improvement. However, today, as the people of the whole country are striving to double steel production, and industrial and agricultural production in many places is also advancing at a doubled pace, the development speed of railway transportation work is obviously dwarfed by comparison. Currently, railways are loading 28,000 to 29,000 cars daily, but there is still a significant gap from the needs. In order to guarantee the "steel marshal's" entry and the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, railway transportation work must also have a great leap forward, that is, to work hard for a month to achieve a daily loading of 35,000 cars!

Can railway transportation efficiency achieve such a great leap forward at present? The answer is yes.

First of all, great potential can still be tapped in railway transportation. According to recent statistics, approximately more than 3,000 loaded cars are backlogged daily at factories, mines, ports, and stations nationwide, unable to be unloaded. As long as factories, mines, ports, and stations prepare sites early, organize handling forces well, and unload cars promptly, the empty cars freed up each day can load more than 1,000 additional cars of goods. Irrational transportation such as cargo counterflow, duplication, excessively long or short transportation distances amounted to more than 70,000 cars in August alone, which is also a significant waste. There are also many shortcomings in railway transportation organization work. Since July, the main indicators have not met the plan, train operation order is not normal enough, and nearly a quarter of freight trains cannot run on time. In particular, the transportation situation in Zhengzhou and Jinan Railway Bureaus is chaotic, occupying more than 4,000 operational cars, which has had an adverse impact on national railway transportation work. These shortcomings in work can be overcome with the joint efforts of railways and factories and mines. Overcoming these shortcomings will greatly increase railway transportation capacity.

If you don't believe it, please see the news from Jinzhou Railway Bureau published in this newspaper yesterday. Jinzhou Railway Bureau has already set an example, planting a bright red flag in railway transportation work. The party committee secretary of this bureau goes deep into the front line every day, grasping production and ideology, and many grassroots party organization secretaries sleep on the front line, directing and participating in production, and fighting hard with the workers. They lead transportation work using the mass movement method, constantly proposing higher goals; organizing debates among the masses, constantly criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas, and guiding the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses to the key to production. They are good at discovering new things; wherever there is advanced experience, they hold on-site meetings and actively organize promotion. In particular, they have grasped the experiences of three different types of stations, Luotuo Ying, Goubangzi, and Dahushan, and promoted them throughout the bureau, achieving remarkable results. Luotuo Ying Station extensively collaborated with factories and mines, breaking with conventions and shortening the vehicle's dwell time at the mine from 8.6 hours to 2.8 hours. Goubangzi Station relied on the local party committee to organize five loading and unloading teams, implemented express loading and unloading without detaching cars, and shortened the vehicle loading and unloading operation time from 9.5 hours to 1.3 hours; it once reached a minimum of 0.4 hours. Dahushan Station created the experience of organizing fast train transfer, shortening the transfer time from 1.6 hours to 0.8 hours. After they promoted the experience of these units, the bureau saved an average of more than 700 operational cars every day. This greatly enhanced transportation efficiency. If Jinzhou Bureau can achieve such excellent results, why can't other railway bureaus do the same? If all the railways in the country do what Jinzhou Bureau does, they can greatly improve transportation efficiency and alleviate the transportation bottleneck.

In addition to learning from the experience of Jinzhou Railway Bureau, vigorously carrying out the technical revolution is also an important method for continuously improving transportation efficiency. In recent months, railway employees across the country have actively participated in the technical revolution movement, and the number of inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals has exceeded any period in the past by hundreds or thousands of times. Among the millions of mass inventions and creations, many require little money, are simple and easy to implement, and have great effects. For example, an earthen hump marshalling yard that can be built in just two or three days can immediately increase the station's operating capacity by 20% to 100%. The new type of switch without turnout greatly increases the speed of trains passing through. Simple automatic blocking and unmanned signal stations significantly improve the passing capacity of the line. Transforming the thermal equipment of steam locomotives increases the locomotive's traction capacity by 20%. Implementing semi-mechanization and vehicle-ization of loading and unloading operations greatly shortens the loading and unloading operation time, and so on. Vigorously promoting these achievements of the technical revolution and further guiding the enthusiasm of the masses for the technical revolution to solving the key to production can greatly improve transportation efficiency.

Whether railway transportation efficiency can have a great leap forward depends very much on actively relying on local party committees. At present, local party committees and governments at all levels have strengthened their leadership over railway work. Many places have established transportation command centers, made decisions to strengthen railway transportation work, established mass transportation armies, and solved the problem of collaboration between railways and factories and mining enterprises. For example, serious congestion had occurred at many stations of the Shenyang Railway Bureau. At its worst, more than 11,000 cars of goods were backlogged at various stations, so that hundreds of freight cars could not be unloaded every day. After the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee discovered this situation, it immediately made a decision to reverse the tense situation of railway transportation work, mobilized various means of transportation, and quickly dispersed the goods at the stations. Serious cargo backlog had also occurred at Changzhou Station. At that time, goods were piled up like mountains at the station. Arriving goods could not be unloaded, and goods to be shipped could not be loaded. The Changzhou Municipal Party Committee and the People's Committee organized a mass transportation army. Under the personal leadership of the Municipal Party Secretary and the Mayor, the masses, carrying baskets, pushing small carts, and using soap boxes, rice washing baskets, flour bags, etc., with the spirit of "ants moving Mount Tai," worked hard for five days and nights to clear the 20,000 tons of goods backlogged at the station and alleviated the tense situation at the station. At present, this transportation team is developing in the direction of tooling, institutionalization, and regularization. Hegang Station and the coal mine had long been arguing with each other in the past. The coal mine was afraid of coal falling to the ground, so it requested more cars. The railway was afraid of backlogging vehicles, so it allocated fewer cars. They often bargained. After a debate between the two sides against departmentalism, the idea of communist collaboration was established. Under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, a joint dispatch office was established to unify dispatch, unify shifts, reform the mutually restrictive system, and simplify the vehicle inspection process, shortening the vehicle's dwell time in the mine from 8.2 hours to 7.5 hours. These facts prove that relying on the Party Committee to implement the policy of the whole party and the whole people running the railways, railway transportation work will definitely have a greater leap forward.

It should also be noted that the rise of the people's communes will bring about new changes in the relationship between railways and rural areas, thereby greatly contributing to the improvement of railway transportation efficiency. Recently, the people's commune near Xiaoba Station in Henan Province transferred more than 300 young adults to organize a transportation camp and opened a factory near the station. When the railway came, they loaded, unloaded, and carried, and when there were no cars, they produced in the factory. Due to the strengthening of loading and unloading forces, the vehicle's dwell time at the station was shortened from 22 hours to 4 hours. The people's commune near Guanting Station organized 40 commune members to plant experimental fields and engage in sideline production near the station, while helping the railway load, unload, and carry. They were both workers and farmers, achieving both ends. The vehicle's dwell time at this station was shortened from 26.6 hours to 10.4 hours. This situation of people's communes assisting railways in transportation will inevitably develop widely in various places and become a reliable helper for railway transportation.

The above situation shows that it is entirely possible for railway transportation efficiency to reach a daily loading of 35,000 cars. The question is how much subjective effort we make. If all railway employees, with soaring enthusiasm and a fighting attitude, widely and deeply carry out the "car dedication" movement, everyone dedicates cars, every station dedicates cars, asks for empty cars from loaded cars, and asks for efficiency from cooperation, uses one car as two cars, uses the night as the day, seizes every second, and does everything possible to accelerate the turnover of locomotives and vehicles, and combines the strength of the railway with the strength of the masses, then transportation efficiency will definitely be improved, and the rapidly increasing heavy transportation tasks will definitely be shouldered!

To achieve a daily loading of 35,000 cars, it is not enough to rely solely on the efforts of all the employees of the railway transportation department. Local party committees must take this work as an urgent task. Local party committees and people's committees should further strengthen their leadership over the railway, immediately conduct a major inspection of the railway's work, and at present, in particular, seize the solution of the collaboration between the railway and factories and mines, mobilize the masses, gather all the manpower that can be gathered, organize a large loading and unloading army, accelerate unloading and loading, and quickly reverse the phenomenon of freight car backlog. For the goods that need to be transported, prioritize them according to their importance and urgency to ensure the timely transportation of materials related to steel production and other major materials.

At present, Jinzhou Railway Bureau is the red flag of national railway transportation work. Railway employees in all places should learn from Jinzhou, catch up with Jinzhou, and plant red flags all over the national railway network. The current railway transportation situation is tense, and the time is also urgent. We believe that under the strong leadership of the local party committees, railway employees and the broad masses of the people across the country will be able to complete the arduous and glorious task of loading 35,000 cars daily on the national railway after a month of hard struggle.

### 苦战一月，实现日装三万五千车！

    苦战一月，实现日装三万五千车！
    关于掀起一个全民运输运动，解决当前运输紧张的问题，我们已经在昨天的社论中谈过了。现在需要特别谈一谈提高铁路运输效率的问题。铁路是运量最大的运输工具，提高铁路的运输效率，是解除目前运输紧张状况的一个重要关键。今年8月份，铁路货运量比去年同期增长了40％，这已经是一个很大的进步。但是在今天，全国人民正为实现钢产加番而奋斗，许多地方的工农业生产也以翻一番的高速度在前进，铁路运输工作的发展速度显然是相形见拙了。目前铁路每日装车已达两万八、九千辆，但是同需要仍然有很大的距离。为了保证钢铁元帅升帐和工农业大跃进的需要，铁路运输工作也必须来一个大跃进，就是说，要苦战一个月，实现每日装车三万五千辆！
    目前，铁路运输效率能不能实现这样一个大跃进呢？回答是肯定的。
    首先，铁路运输中还可以挖出很大的潜力。据最近统计，全国铁路每天大约有三千多辆重车积压在厂矿、港口和车站，卸不下来，只要各厂矿、港口、车站及早准备场地、组织好搬运力量，抓紧卸车，每天腾出的空车就可以多装一千多车货物。货物对流、重复、运输距离过长或过短等不合理运输，仅8月份就达七万多车，这也是一项很大的浪费。铁路运输组织工作也有不少缺点，7月份以来，各项主要指标没有完成计划，列车运行秩序不够正常，有将近四分之一的货物列车不能正点运行，特别是郑州、济南两个铁路局运输情况混乱，多占用了四千多辆运用车，给全国铁路运输工作造成了不利的影响。这些工作上的缺点，只要铁路和厂矿共同努力，都是可以克服的。克服了这些缺点，铁路运输力量就可大大增长。
    如若不信，请看本报昨天发表的锦州铁路局的新闻，锦州铁路局已经做出了榜样，在铁路运输工作上插上了一面鲜明的红旗。这个局的党委书记每天深入现场，抓生产、抓思想，很多基层党组织的书记都睡在现场，指挥与参加生产，同工人一起苦战。他们以群众运动的方法来领导运输工作，不断提出更高的奋斗目标；在群众中组织辩论，不断批判右倾保守思想，并把群众的革命热情，引向生产关键。他们善于发现新鲜事物，哪里有先进经验，就在哪里开现场会议，积极组织推广。特别是他们抓住了骆驼营、沟帮子、大虎山三个不同类型的车站的经验，在全局推广，取得了显著的效果。骆驼营车站与厂矿大搞协作，打破了常规，使车辆在矿上的停留时间由八点六小时缩短到二点八小时。沟帮子车站依靠当地党委组织了五个装卸梯队，实行了快递不摘车装卸，把车辆装卸作业时间从九点五小时缩短到一点三小时；最低曾达到零点四小时。大虎山车站创造了组织列车快速中转的经验，使中转时间由一点六小时缩短到零点八小时。在他们推广了这些单位的经验以后，全局平均每天节省了七百多辆运用车。这样就大大地增强了运输效率。锦州局能够做出这样优良的成绩，其他铁路局为什么不能做到呢？如果全国铁路都像锦州局这样做，就可以大大提高运输效率，缓和运输的紧张状况。
    除了学习锦州铁路局的经验以外，大闹技术革命也是不断提高运输效率的重要方法。几个月来全国铁路职工积极参加了技术革命运动，发明创造和合理化建议之多，千百倍地超过了过去任何时期。在千百万件群众的发明创造中，有许多是花钱不多、简单易行、效果很大的。例如，只花二、三天功夫就能建成的土驼峰调车场，马上使车站的作业能力提高20％到100％。新式的无岔尖道岔，大大提高列车的通过速度。简易自动闭塞、无人信号所显著地提高了线路的通过能力。改造蒸汽机车的热力设备提高了机车的牵引能力20％。装卸作业实行半机械化和车子化以后，大大缩短了装卸作业时间等等。大力推广这些技术革命的成果，并且把群众大闹技术革命的热情进一步引导到解决生产关键上来，就可以大大提高运输效率。
    铁路运输效率能否大跃进，很重要的一条是要积极依靠当地党委。目前，各个地方党委和政府已经加强了对铁路工作的领导，许多地方成立了运输指挥部，做了加强铁路运输工作的决定，建立了群众性的运输大军，解决了铁路与厂矿企业的协作问题。例如沈阳铁路局许多车站曾经发生过严重的阻塞现象，最严重的时候，有一万一千多车货物积压在各车站，以致每天有几百辆货车无法卸下。辽宁省委发现这个情况之后，就马上作出了扭转铁路运输工作紧张情况的决定，动员了各种运输工具，很快地疏散了车站货物。常州车站也发生过货物严重积压的现象，当时站上货物堆积如山，到达的货物卸不下，运出的货装不上，常州市委和人委组织了群众性的运输大军，在市委书记和市长亲自带领下，群众挑着萝筐，推着小车，用肥皂箱、淘米箩、面粉袋等以“蚂蚁搬泰山”的气魄，苦战五昼夜，清除了车站积压的二万吨货物，解除了车站上的紧张局面。目前这支运输队正在朝着工具化、制度化、经常化的方向发展。鹤岗车站与煤矿过去长期互相扯皮，煤矿怕产煤落地就多请求车，铁路怕积压车辆就少配车，经常讨价还价。经过双方反对本位主义的辩论，树立了共产主义的协作思想，在市委领导下成立了联合调度办公室，统一了调度，统一了班次，改革了互相制约的制度，简化了检车作业过程，使车辆在矿内的停留时间由八点二小时缩短到七点五小时。这些事实证明，依靠党委贯彻全党全民办铁路的方针，铁路运输工作就一定会有更大的跃进。
  还应该注意到人民公社的兴起，将使铁路与农村的关系发生新的变化，从而大大有助于铁路运输效率的提高。最近河南省小坝车站附近的人民公社抽调了三百多名青壮年，组织了一个运输营，并在车站附近开办了工厂。铁路来车就装卸搬运，没有车就在工厂生产。由于装卸力量的加强，车站的车辆停留时间就由二十二小时缩短到四小时。官厅车站附近的人民公社组织了四十名社员在车站附近一面种试验田搞副业，一面帮助铁路装卸搬运，亦工亦农，两全其美；这个站的车辆停留时间就从二十六点六小时缩短到十点四小时。这种人民公社协助铁路办运输的情况，必然会在各地广泛地发展起来，成为铁路运输可靠的助手。
    上述情况说明，铁路运输效率达到每日装车三万五千辆是完全可能的。问题在于我们主观努力的程度如何。如果全体铁路职工都以冲天干劲，战斗的姿态，广泛地深入地开展“献车”运动，人人献车、站站献车，向重车要空车，向协作要效率，以一辆当两辆，以黑夜当白天，分秒必争，千方百计地加速机车车辆周转，并且把铁路的力量和群众的力量结合起来，那末运输效率就一定能提高，急剧增长的繁重运输任务就一定能担负起来！
    实现每日装车三万五千辆，仅靠铁路运输部门的全体职工的努力还是不够的，必须要各地党委把这个工作当作一个紧急任务抓起来。各地方党委和人委要进一步加强对铁路的领导，立即对铁路的工作进行一次大检查，在目前特别要抓紧解决铁路与厂矿的协作，发动群众，调集一切可能调集的人力，组织装卸大军，加速卸车、装车，迅速扭转货车积压的现象。对于需要运输的货物，要分别轻重缓急，进行排队，以保证有关钢铁生产的材料和其它主要物资及时运输。
    目前锦州铁路局是全国铁路运输工作的红旗，各地铁路职工都应当学锦州，赶锦州，把红旗插遍全国铁路网。目前铁路运输的情况是紧张的，时间也是急迫的。我们相信，全国铁路职工和广大人民群众在各地党委的坚强领导下，苦战一个月，一定能够完成全国铁路每日装车三万五千辆的繁重而光荣的任务。
