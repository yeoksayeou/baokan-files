The Heroic People on the Coastal Defense Front
By our reporter Chen Qitong

　　Recently, on a clear morning, I took a regular boat to visit the Greater and Lesser Deng Islands in Jinmen County, Fujian Province. Although these islands are only five or six li away from Jinmen Island itself, which is occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, and are frequently subjected to attacks by Chiang's aircraft and artillery, they still present a scene of unprecedented prosperity everywhere. New houses built of granite and red bricks stand in the mountain valleys; hundreds of thousands of acacia, chinaberry, and banyan trees planted after liberation have mostly grown into lush shade. The vast numbers of farmers are excitedly discussing the recent news of the heavy blows inflicted on Chiang's troops by the People's Liberation Army, while groups of three or five are rushing to harvest the unprecedentedly abundant peanuts and replanting the peanut fields with late sweet potatoes. Salt production, which accounts for more than 80% of the total income of the island's residents, also achieved an unprecedented harvest in the first half of this year, with an increase of 1.75 times compared to the same period last year. Salt fields are everywhere piled high with salt mounds covered with straw. Only the air-raid shelters, artillery shelters, and crisscrossing trenches built in the villages and fields to defend against attacks by Chiang's aircraft and artillery vaguely tell people that this is a frontline island where a sharp struggle is taking place day and night.

　　Since liberation, the more than 1,500 households living on these two islands, known as "sea fortresses," have heroically defended the motherland's coastal defenses alongside the People's Liberation Army stationed on the islands, inflicting heavy blows on Chiang's troops in Jinmen. At the same time, they have used the rich air defense and artillery defense knowledge and various air defense and artillery defense equipment accumulated in the struggle to persist in production amidst the frequent attacks of Chiang's artillery fire, engaging in various socialist construction projects with great enthusiasm. The current production levels of the island's six agricultural, fishing, salt, and shipping production cooperatives have all exceeded the highest levels before liberation by one to several times. At the same time, in this year's great leap forward in industrial construction, culture, and education, nearly a hundred farm tool factories, repair stations, marine fertilizer processing plants, shell ash plants, and wind-powered processing plants have been established according to local conditions. Villages and cooperatives have established community-run primary schools and amateur middle schools, completely eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in just over three months, and establishing an amateur university with three specialties: salt industry, navigation, and agriculture.

　　The heroic spirit of the islanders has been fully demonstrated in the midst of carrying out the struggle against the enemy and persisting in production, and many heroic struggles have emerged.

　　One morning, six young fishermen, including Zhang Jindian and Zhang Shuiqiao, who were awarded second-class merit for supporting the front lines, sailed their small boat out to sea to fish and hunt sharks, chasing schools of fish all the way to the vicinity of Jinmen Island, which is occupied by Chiang's troops. At this time, the Chiang's troops, who were terrified day and night, panicked when they saw this sudden appearance of a fishing boat, immediately firing a barrage of cannons and then sending gunboats to "intercept." However, Zhang Jindian and the other six fishermen, who only discovered that they had sailed into the waters near Jinmen Island when Chiang's troops opened fire, calmly reeled in their fishing lines and used their long-tested skills to turn the boat around, weaving back and forth amidst the bursts of water columns caused by Chiang's artillery shells. By the time Chiang's gunboats caught up, they had already returned victoriously, hidden their fishing boat, and carried loads of fresh fish and fishing gear along the trenches to their homes for dinner, infuriating the Chiang's gunboats, which had no choice but to return in disgrace.

　　The people of the heroic Greater and Lesser Deng Islands, not only use such a heroic and tenacious spirit to persist in production amidst the attacks of Chiang's aircraft and artillery, to increase material wealth for the motherland, but also fully demonstrate their heroic and fearless spirit in supporting the front lines, defending the motherland's coastal defenses alongside the People's Liberation Army, and carrying out the struggle against the enemy. One dark night, Zhang Shunqi, a Fujian Provincial Youth Socialist Construction Activist, and six militiamen, including Zhang Jimin and Zhang Qiankun, sailed a boat with two comrades from the People's Liberation Army to the forefront of an island occupied by Chiang's troops to scout out the situation and distribute leaflets. As they were finishing their reconnaissance and distributing leaflets, militiaman Zhang Shuihong, who was sitting at the stern of the boat, suddenly discovered a dark shadow moving slowly towards them in the faintly shimmering water. Zhang Shuihong lay down on the boat's plank and listened. It turned out to be a Chiang's patrol boat slowly approaching them, only a few hundred meters away. At this time, all eight people on the boat immediately lay down on the boat's sides, opened the grenade caps, prepared for battle, turned the boat around, and took advantage of the near-ebb tide, risked crossing the rapids obliquely, quickly avoided the Chiang's warship's course. Later, when Chiang's warship sped up to search and chase them, they had already left seven or eight miles away, contacted the island's coastal defense troops with lights, and sailed back with full sails. On another occasion, Zhang Wenqiu, the enthusiastic supporter of the front lines and captain of the Lianxing Wooden Sailboat Transportation Cooperative, and the members of the cooperative were sailing a large sailboat full of supplies to a certain place when they were suddenly discovered by Chiang's troops just as they were about to cross Chiang's last blockade line. In an instant, bursts of water columns from Chiang's artillery shells exploded around the sailboat, and most of the sailboat's ropes were broken by the aerial explosions of the artillery shells. Zhang Wenqiu, who was standing at the stern steering the rudder, was also wounded in the head by shrapnel and was bleeding profusely, but he still gritted his teeth and endured the pain, gripping the rudder tightly, directing the crew to reconnect the broken ropes, and using the two- or three-zhang-high water columns caused by Chiang's artillery shells as cover to steer the sailboat out of Chiang's artillery blockade line.

　　Recently, when news of the crime of the US-Chiang Kai-shek clique creating tension in the Taiwan Strait and the US State Department's publication of a memorandum smearing the Chinese people reached the island, it further aroused the anger of the islanders. Hong Shunli, a model militiaman of Fujian Province and the captain of the Xiaodeng Island militia, who once led the militia to cooperate with the troops in capturing more than a dozen US-Chiang Kai-shek spies, sailed boats to transport the People's Liberation Army reconnaissance troops to raid Jinmen Island at night, and attended the National Youth Socialist Construction Activist Conference, resolutely said: We must redouble our vigilance, use practical actions such as stepping up production and consolidating coastal defense, and be ready at any time to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinmen and Taiwan, and we will never give up until we achieve our goal!

　　海防前线的英雄人民
　　本报记者　陈启桐
    日前，记者在一个晴朗的上午，乘着班船渡海访问了福建省金门县大、小嶝岛。这里虽然和蒋军盘踞的金门岛本岛相距仅五、六华里，经常遭受蒋军飞机、大炮的袭扰，但是到处仍然呈现着空前繁荣的景象。山垇里矗立着幢幢用花冈石和红砖砌成的新房；解放后种下的几十万株相思树、苦楝树和榕树，大部分已经葱绿成荫。广大农民们正兴奋地一面谈论着最近人民解放军给予蒋军沉重打击的消息，一面三、五成群地在抢收空前丰收的花生，又在花生地上抢种晚甘薯。占岛上居民总收入80％以上的盐业生产，今年上半年也获得空前丰收，比去年同期增产了一点七五倍，盐场上到处堆满用稻草复盖着的盐山。只有为了防避蒋军飞机、大炮的袭击，在村里和田间修建起来的防空洞、防炮洞和纵横交错的防炮壕等，才隐约地告诉人们：这里是日日夜夜进行着尖锐斗争的前哨岛屿。
    居住在这两座被称为“海上堡垒”的一千五百多户人民，从解放以来，就一面英勇地和岛上人民解放军并肩保卫着祖国海防，给予金门蒋军以沉重的打击；一面又运用他们在斗争中积累起来的丰富的防空、防炮常识，以及各式各样的防空、防炮设备，在蒋军炮火频繁袭扰中坚持生产，热火朝天地从事各种社会主义建设。岛上六个农、渔、盐和航业生产合作社现有生产水平，都已超过解放前最高水平一倍到数倍。同时还在今年工业建设、文化教育大跃进中，因地制宜地建立了近百座农具厂、修配站、海肥加工厂、壳灰厂、风力加工厂；村村、社社办起了民办小学、业余中学，在短短三个多月中就全部扫清了青壮年文盲，并成立了一所包括有盐业、航海和农业等三个专科的业余大学。
    在一面开展对敌斗争、一面坚持生产中，充分表现了岛上人民的英雄气概，出现了许许多多英勇斗争的故事。
    一天早晨，在支援前线中荣立二等功的张金典、张水钓等六个青年渔民，驾着小船出海放钓、追捕鲨鱼，一口气追捕鱼群追到蒋军盘踞的金门岛附近。这时，日夜惶恐不安的蒋军看到这条突如其来的渔船，马上慌乱起来，先用排炮乱轰，后派炮艇赶来“拦击”。可是，直到蒋军发炮时方才发现自己已驶到金门岛近海的张金典等六个渔民，却不慌不忙地一面收着鱼钓，一面使出了他们久经考验的本领，掉转船头，忽东忽西地在蒋军炮弹打起的阵阵水柱中穿梭往回行驶。等到蒋军炮艇赶上来时，他们已胜利回航，把渔船掩蔽起来，挑着担担鲜鱼和渔具沿着防炮壕回到家里吃饭去了，气得赶来的蒋军炮艇只好灰溜溜地回去了。
    英雄的大、小嶝岛上的人民，不但用这样英勇顽强的精神，冒着蒋军飞机、大炮的袭扰坚持生产，为祖国增加物质财富，同时在支援前线，和人民解放军并肩保卫祖国海防，开展对敌斗争中，也充分显示了他们的英雄主义的大无畏精神。一个漆黑的夜晚，福建省青年社会主义建设积极分子张顺起和张基明、张乾坤等六个民兵，驾船带领着两个解放军同志到蒋军盘踞的一个岛屿前沿去侦察情况和散发传单。当他们刚侦察好敌情正在散发传单的时候，坐在船尾的民兵张水虹忽然在闪着微光的水影中发现有个黑影正向着他们这边慢慢移动。张水虹伏在船板上一听，原来是一艘蒋军巡逻舰艇正开着慢车悄悄地向他们扑来，距离他们只有几百公尺远。这时，全船八个人马上一面伏在船舷上揭开手榴弹盖作好战斗准备，一面掉转船头，利用将近退潮的时刻，冒着危险从斜刺里穿过激流，迅速避开了蒋军舰艇的航向。后来，蒋军舰艇开足快车进行搜索和追赶时，他们早已离开了七、八里路，用灯光和岛上海防部队取得联系，并挂着满帆驶回来了。又有一次，联星木帆船运输合作社支前积极分子、船老大张文秋和船上的社员们，驾驶着一艘满载支前物资的大帆船开向某地，当他们刚刚要穿过蒋军最后一条封锁线时，突然被蒋军发现了。霎那间，帆船周围飞起了蒋军炮弹爆炸的阵阵水柱，船上的帆绳大部被空中爆炸的炮弹打断了。站在船尾掌着舵的张文秋的头部也被弹片打伤，血流满面，但他仍然咬紧牙根忍着疼痛，紧握着船舵，一面指挥着船员接好被打断了的帆绳，一面利用蒋军炮弹打起的两、三丈高的水柱作掩护，把帆船驶出了蒋军炮火封锁线。
    最近当美蒋在台湾海峡制造紧张局势的罪行，美国国务院发表了污蔑中国人民的备忘录的消息传到岛上后，更加激起了岛上人民的愤怒。曾经带领民兵配合部队活捉十多名美蒋特务、驾船运载人民解放军侦察部队夜袭金门岛、出席过全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的福建省民兵模范、小嶝岛民兵队长洪顺利坚决地说：我们一定要加倍提高警惕，用加紧生产、巩固海防等实际行动，随时准备支援人民解放军解放金门、台湾，不达目的誓不罢休！
