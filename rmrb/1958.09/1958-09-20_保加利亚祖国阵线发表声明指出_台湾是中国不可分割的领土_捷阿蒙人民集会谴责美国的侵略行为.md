Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 18th: The Bulgarian Fatherland Front, with over 2.9 million members, issued a statement on the 18th, firmly supporting the Chinese people's just struggle against US aggression and provocation.

The statement said that the Fatherland Front, the front of patriotic and peace-loving forces in Bulgaria, stands firmly with the great Chinese people together with all the Bulgarian people and will fight with all its strength to shatter the evil schemes of the enemies of peace and win the ultimate victory for the Chinese people and all peace-loving mankind.

The statement pointed out that the mass protest rallies widely held throughout Bulgaria fully demonstrate the Bulgarian working people's full support for the just struggle of the Chinese people.

The statement emphasized that Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other coastal islands are an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China. The US imperialist occupation of Taiwan and the military provocations launched in the Taiwan Strait against the Chinese people are interference in China's internal affairs. The US aggressor troops must immediately withdraw from these islands.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 18th: Today, "Red Right Newspaper," under the headline "The Islands of China Belong to the Chinese People," continued to publish news of the Czechoslovak working people's angry protests against the US imperialists' provocations against the Chinese people.

Workers at the Pal Kabej Machinery Factory in Prague recently held a protest rally. In their speeches, they pointed out that the US troops should immediately withdraw from China's islands. Workers in a workshop at the Gottwaldov Dawn Shoe Factory handed over a protest resolution passed by them to the US Embassy in Czechoslovakia. The resolution demanded that the American bullies go home.

The workers of the largest machinery factory in Czechoslovakia, the Lenin Factory in Pilsen, in order to support the struggle of the fraternal Chinese people, ensured that a batch of machines manufactured for China would be shipped to China a month ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, September 18th: Workers in various parts of Albania continue to hold protest rallies condemning US imperialist provocative acts in the Taiwan Strait. At rallies held at the Enver Hoxha Metal Processing Plant, the State Publishing Bureau, and the Tirana Shoe Factory in the capital, workers indignantly shouted "Yankee, get out of China!" "Stop playing with fire immediately!" The peasants in the suburbs of Tirana also expressed their immense indignation at the shameless provocations of the American imperialists. Muka, chairman of the Mazeza Cooperative, said: Shameful failure is awaiting the invaders. Just as Comrade Mao Zedong said, US imperialism has put a noose around its own neck.

Soldiers of the Albanian People's Army are also eagerly reading and listening to news from China and holding symposiums. Qian Dani, a soldier in a certain unit, said that we will always stand side by side with the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, September 19th: Faculty and students of the Mongolian People's Republic's Choibalsan University held a rally on the 18th to protest against US imperialist military provocations in the Taiwan Strait region. The rally passed a telegram demanding an end to US imperialist war provocations and demanding that US aggressor troops immediately withdraw from Taiwan.
