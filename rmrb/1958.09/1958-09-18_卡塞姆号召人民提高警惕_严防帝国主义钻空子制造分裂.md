Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to a broadcast from the Iraqi Republic Radio, Iraqi Republic Prime Minister Qassem recently met with a delegation of Islamic scholars in Baghdad and addressed them.

In his speech, Prime Minister Qassem urged the Iraqi people to be vigilant and prevent the conspiracies of foreign forces and separatists to undermine the Iraqi Republic. He said, "We will oppose those who attempt to impose their will and control on us. Our relations with all countries in the world are based on the common interests that guarantee the people's aspirations." He also said, "We will not allow foreigners to interfere in our internal and foreign affairs in any way."

Speaking of domestic issues, Prime Minister Qassem emphasized the need to focus on unity. He said, "Foreigners are trying to find gaps in our ranks in order to infiltrate and achieve their goals through certain means. This means is to divide us, so that various groups will fight each other. In this way, we will all be weakened, and foreigners can seize our country's resources and create chaos and division."

He said that it is impossible for foreigners to try to turn the armed forces into a tool for attacking the people through their various provocations and conspiracies.

He said, "We will devote ourselves to improving the people's health, cultural, and social standards so that the people can feel their status and their strength for survival, and work in accordance with the people's opinions."

In response to a question raised by a representative, Prime Minister Qassem said that in order to find excuses to interfere in our affairs and to divert the people's attention from their conspiracies, imperialism has adopted a principle of labeling all patriotic activities as subversive activities that should be attacked and banned.

He added, "Under no circumstances are we afraid of imperialism. Imperialism is trying to divide us in order to interfere in our affairs as in Lebanon, but we know how to deal with them. Our republic has been liberated, and we will always firmly and confidently move forward on the road to happiness for the people."

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 16th, TASS: According to newspaper reports, Iraqi Republic Prime Minister Qassem, when meeting with a delegation of Iraqi writers, elaborated on the basic points of the Iraqi government's policy.

He said, "I can assure you that we will not deviate from our established goals to the right or to the left, and we will always take the interests of the people as the guiding principle."

Qassem said that the Iraqi government's foreign policy is based on the desire for friendly and peaceful coexistence with all countries. He said that the most important task in internal affairs is to improve the people's living standards and strengthen the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation. He said, "We are in a transitional period, and later, when the people's living standards improve, the people will be given the conditions to express their decisive opinions on the form of the national system."

The Prime Minister emphasized that every agreement and every treaty must be carefully and meticulously studied to clarify whether they are in the interests of the people.

Qassem said that in foreign policy, we will not conclude any treaties or agreements that do not take into account domestic public opinion.

    卡塞姆号召人民提高警惕
    严防帝国主义钻空子制造分裂
    新华社16日讯　据伊拉克共和国电台广播，伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆最近接见了巴格达的伊斯兰教学者代表团，并且对他们发表了谈话。
    卡塞姆总理在谈话中要求伊拉克人民提高警惕，防止外国势力和分裂分子破坏伊拉克共和国的阴谋。他说，我们将反对企图把他们的意志和控制强加于我们的人。我们同世界各国的关系是以保证人民愿望的共同利益为基础的。他还说，我们将不让外国人对我们的内政和外交进行任何干涉。
    谈到国内问题，卡塞姆总理强调应该致力于团结。他说，外国人企图在我们队伍中间寻找空隙，以便钻进来通过一定的手段实现他们的目的。这种手段就是把我们搞得四分五裂，使各个集团彼此倾轧，这样，我们大家就都被削弱了，外国人就可以从中攫取我们国家的资源，并且制造混乱和分裂。
    他说，外国人企图通过他们的种种挑拨和阴谋要使武装部队变成打击人民的工具，这是不可能的。
    他说，我们将致力于提高人民的健康、文化和社会水平，以便使人民感到他们的地位和他们的生存力量，并且按照人民的意见进行工作。
    卡塞姆总理在回答一位代表提出的问题时说，为了找出借口来干涉我们的事务，为了转移人民的视线，不去注意他们的阴谋诡计，帝国主义采取了一条原则，就是把一切爱国活动一律称之为应予打击和取缔的颠复活动。
    他又说，在任何情况下，我们都不害怕帝国主义。帝国主义企图分裂我们，以便像在黎巴嫩一样来干涉我们的事务，但是我们懂得怎样对付他们。我们的共和国已经得到解放，我们将永远坚决地满怀信心地向着为人民谋幸福的大道迈进。
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社巴格达16日讯：据报纸报道，伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆在接见伊拉克作家代表团时，阐述了伊拉克政府政策的基本要点。
    他说，我可以向你们肯定地说，我们不会离开既定的目标向右转，也不会向左转，我们将永远以人民的利益为准绳。
    卡塞姆说，伊拉克政府的外交政策是以同一切国家友好和平相处的愿望为基础的。他说，在内政方面最主要的任务是提高人民的生活水平和加强互相信任和合作的精神。他说，我们正处在过渡时期，以后当人民生活水平提高的时候，将给予人民条件，使他们有可能就国家制度形式表示决定性的意见。
    总理强调说，每一个协定，每一个条约都必须慎重仔细地加以研究，弄清楚它们是不是符合人民的利益。
    卡塞姆说，在外交政策方面我们不缔结任何不考虑国内舆论的条约和协定。
