Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th. Despite unfavorable weather conditions, Czechoslovakia's grain harvesting work has been successfully completed. The national grain purchase plan for all nineteen states was completed in mid-September, earlier than any previous year. Compared with 1956, the year with the best harvest, the state purchased nearly 400,000 tons more grain this year. One of the main reasons for this achievement is that, for the first time, unified agricultural cooperatives supplied more than half of the total state purchases of grain, compared to less than 30% last year. Farmers are enthusiastically delivering more grain to the state to better fulfill the state purchase plan.

    捷谷物收成好
    国家多收购近四十万吨粮食
    新华社布拉格18日电　尽管气候条件不好，捷克斯洛伐克的谷物收割工作已经胜利结束。全国十九个州的谷物收购计划在9月中旬已经完成，这比以往任何一年都早。和收成最好的1956年相比，今年国家多收购了将近四十万吨谷物。获得这个成就的主要原因之一是，统一农业合作社今年向国家缴售的谷物，第一次占国家收购总量的一半以上，而去年还占不到30％。农民们踊跃地向国家多缴纳粮食，以便更好地实现国家收购计划。
