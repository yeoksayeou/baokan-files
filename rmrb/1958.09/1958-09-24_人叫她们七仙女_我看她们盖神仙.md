    People Call Them Seven Fairies, But I Think They're Building Immortals
    Old man is seventy and a half
    Generations have lived in the tea mountains
    Tea mountain experts number in the thousands
    Daily picking of a thousand catties has never been seen
    No one compares them to rockets
    Rockets are also half as slow
    People call them "Seven Fairies"
    I think they're building immortals
    This allegro poem was written by Xie Daixin, a seventy-five-year-old man from Xiahe Commune in Wufeng County, Hubei, to praise the tea-picking expert Xie Chengzhen. Xie Chengzhen is an eighteen-year-old girl and a member of the Communist Youth League in Xiahe Commune. Recently, in the autumn tea picking competition, she created a record of picking 1,157 catties of fresh leaves in a single day. This record broke her own record of picking 535 catties of fresh leaves in a single day during the summer tea picking season. This is currently the highest tea picking record in the country.
    The reason Xie Chengzhen was able to create such a high tea picking record is primarily because she dared to think and act, and boldly innovated technology. In tea picking, she broke the past habit of picking tea with one hand and adopted picking tea with both hands; she changed from picking tea with two fingers to picking tea with multiple fingers; she changed from the past back-and-forth picking to the "chicken pecking rice" method of picking tea, thus greatly improving tea picking efficiency. In order to improve her skills, she constantly studied and practiced hard. When the tea leaves were all picked, she used chestnut leaves, mulberry leaves, willow leaves... to practice, and finally learned a skillful tea picking technique. She now picks tea more than 350 times per minute. So far, seven women in this commune have broken the 100-catty mark in tea picking. The masses call them the "Seven Fairies," and Xie Chengzhen is the most outstanding of the "Seven Fairies."

### 人叫她们七仙女  我看她们盖神仙

    人叫她们七仙女  我看她们盖神仙
    老汉今年七旬半世世代代住茶山茶山能手千千万日采千斤从未见人把她们比火箭火箭也要慢一半人叫她们“七仙女”我看她们盖神仙
    这首快板诗，是湖北五峰县小河社七十五岁老汉谢代新写来歌颂采茶能手谢承珍的。谢承珍是小河社的一个十八岁的姑娘，共青团员。最近在秋茶采摘大竞赛中，她创造了日采鲜叶一千一百五十七斤的最高纪录。这个纪录又刷新了她自己在夏茶采摘中日采鲜叶五百三十五斤的纪录，这是目前全国最高的采茶纪录。
    谢承珍所以能创造出这样高的采茶纪录，首先是她敢想敢做、大胆革新技术。她在采茶中，打破了过去单手采茶的习惯，采用双手采茶；改变过去两指采茶，采用多指采茶；改变过去拉锯式采茶，采用鸡啄米的方式采茶，因而大大提高了采茶效率。为了提高技术，她不断地苦学苦练，茶叶采光了，就用栗树叶、桑树叶、柳树叶……来练习，终于学得了一手熟练的采茶技术。她现在每分钟已达到采茶三百五十余次。到目前为止，这个社已有七个妇女采茶突破百斤关，群众称她们为“七仙女”，而谢承珍则是“七仙女”中最出色的一个。
