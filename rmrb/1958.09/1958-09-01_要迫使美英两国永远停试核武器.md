In his answers to "Pravda" regarding the question of halting nuclear weapons tests, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers N.S. Khrushchev incisively revealed the deceptive tricks of the U.S. and British governments on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing. Comrade Khrushchev declared that, in view of the fact that the U.S. and Britain were clearly taking advantage of the Soviet Union's suspension of nuclear tests to gain military advantages for themselves, directly violating the will of all nations, the Soviet government was releasing itself from its unilaterally assumed obligations regarding the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons; at the same time, he announced that, in order to reach an agreement on the permanent cessation of testing of all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons by all countries, the Soviet government agreed to begin three-party negotiations with the U.S. and Britain on October 31 this year. The Chinese people fully support the clear position and forceful measures taken by the Soviet government on this issue of concern to all mankind. The Soviet government's attitude has once again helped the people of the world see through the conspiracy of U.S. and British imperialism, which is conducive to promoting the struggle for the permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

As everyone knows, the eight-nation Geneva conference of nuclear experts, which ended on August 21, reached a unanimous conclusion: that any nuclear explosion can be detected and that effective monitoring of a cessation of nuclear weapons tests is entirely feasible. This conclusion, reached with the participation of American and British experts, not only completely confirmed the Soviet Union's consistent position on this issue, but also dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. and British governments. For it was none other than the U.S. and British governments that had persistently refused to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union on halting nuclear tests, citing the excuse that nuclear explosions could not be detected and that effective monitoring of a cessation of nuclear testing was impossible. A reporter for the Japanese news agency Kyodo commented after the Geneva conference of nuclear experts that "because of the conclusion of this expert conference, the Soviet Union's proposal to cease testing has received strong support. Conversely, it must be considered that the opposition arguments of Western countries… have greatly lost their persuasiveness."

The recent series of unprecedentedly large-scale nuclear weapons tests conducted by the U.S. and Britain in the Pacific have aroused universal anger and anxiety among the people of all countries, and the conclusions of the Geneva conference of nuclear experts have completely discredited their oft-repeated excuse that effective monitoring of nuclear tests is impossible. It was under these circumstances that the U.S. and British governments, the day after the end of the Geneva conference of nuclear experts, issued statements declaring their willingness to begin negotiations on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing on October 31 this year and expressed that they would cease testing for one year from the first day of negotiations. Following the statements issued by the U.S. and British governments, the Western propaganda machine, as usual, made a big fuss about it, touting these statements as "peace-loving" actions. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd even boasted that this was a "very important contribution." Good! Then let us see what kind of peace-loving action and what kind of "very important contribution" it really is!

First, the U.S. and British governments only announced that they would stop testing for one year from the day negotiations begin on October 31, rather than stopping immediately from the day they issued their statements. If the U.S. and British governments were truly sincere about stopping testing, then it would have been easy for them to issue an order to immediately stop all testing activities. However, they want to use these two months to intensify nuclear weapons explosion tests. After Eisenhower issued that statement, the chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission immediately announced that the commission was "taking the necessary actions to complete the originally planned tests before the deadline of October 31." The British government openly announced in its statement that it would complete "a series of tests" "as quickly as possible" before October 31, and at the same time as the statement was issued, it immediately ordered the British testing team on Christmas Island in the Pacific to accelerate their work. Can these actions of the U.S. and British governments be considered peace-loving? Can they be said to be a "very important contribution" to the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests? Of course not. To put it bluntly, these actions by the U.S. and British governments are nothing more than an attempt to enhance their "position of strength" in the negotiations that will begin more than two months later by completing these nuclear tests in these two months.

Second, the U.S. and British governments only announced a temporary cessation of testing for one year, rather than a permanent cessation of testing. Why exactly one year, no more, no less? If we consider that after a series of nuclear tests, there must be a period of rest and recuperation, and that one year is precisely the time necessary to prepare for the next series of nuclear tests, then we can understand how much practical significance there is to the so-called one-year suspension of testing. The reason why the U.S. and British governments are willing to offer a "free ride" after their current series of nuclear weapons tests is completed is precisely this. The U.S. "Wall Street Journal" reported that "the (American) government believes that a one-year suspension of testing will not hinder the country's weapons development program," which is corroborating evidence. Is this hypocritical action of the U.S. and British governments, which has the name of stopping testing but not the reality of stopping testing, also peace-loving, also a "very important contribution?"

Finally, the U.S. and British governments only announced that they were prepared to consider the cessation of nuclear weapons testing on a year-by-year basis through negotiations, and that the period of suspension could only be extended by one year each year at the beginning of each year after their proposed conditions were met, rather than concluding an agreement that would be permanently valid. Their conditions are: first, the monitoring system for the cessation of nuclear testing must be "effectively implemented"; second, "satisfactory progress" must be made in resolving the overall issue of disarmament. But what is the actual meaning of these conditions? As for the first condition, the Geneva conference of nuclear experts has scientifically determined that any nuclear explosion can be detected, and that it is impossible to violate the agreement to cease testing without being detected, so there is no question of whether it is "effectively implemented" or not. As for the second condition, the cessation of nuclear testing and the resolution of the overall disarmament issue are two completely different things. The former is easy as pie, while the latter involves a series of complex issues. Based on past experience, the U.S. and Britain have always gone back on their word in disarmament negotiations and have always been obstructing the progress of negotiations. And now the U.S. and British governments are insisting on using the resolution of the overall disarmament issue as a prerequisite for extending the agreement to cease testing for one year, what is their ulterior motive? "Everyone knows what Sima Zhao is up to." The reason why the U.S. and British governments put forward these two conditions is nothing more than to prepare to resume nuclear weapons testing at any time on the pretext that the monitoring of nuclear tests has not reached an "effective" level or that "satisfactory progress" has not been made on the disarmament issue. Can this action of the U.S. and British governments, which plots to resume nuclear testing before the cessation of nuclear testing is implemented, also be said to be a peace-loving action, a "very important contribution" to the issue of stopping nuclear testing?

From what has been said above, the statements forced to be issued by the U.S. and British governments on August 22 absolutely cannot prove that they have changed their original stubborn stance, but can only show that they are once again playing tricks of deception, attempting to ease the condemnation of them by peace-loving people all over the world and to paralyze the vigilance of the people of all countries.

Since the Soviet Union announced its unilateral suspension of nuclear weapons testing on March 31, the U.S. and Britain have intensified the explosion tests of various types of nuclear weapons. The United States conducted more than 30 nuclear weapons explosion tests in less than three months, from April 28 to July 26. Britain has also conducted several thermonuclear weapons explosion tests. Moreover, before October 31, the U.S. and Britain will continue to conduct a series of nuclear weapons tests. In the face of these actions by the United States and Britain that violate the will of the people of all countries, the Soviet government has released itself from its unilaterally assumed obligations to suspend nuclear weapons testing, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on March 31 on the issue of the Soviet Union's unilateral suspension of atomic and hydrogen weapons testing. This action by the Soviet government is not only necessary for the security interests of the Soviet Union, but also necessary for the security interests of the people of all countries. Everyone understands that facing the aggressive forces of imperialism, talking about peace with empty words without making efforts to develop and strengthen the forces sufficient to defend peace will only fuel the arrogance of the aggressive forces of imperialism and endanger peace.

However, in the spirit of consistently striving for peace and striving for all countries possessing nuclear weapons to stop the testing, production, and use of nuclear weapons, the Soviet Union is still willing to make another effort, agreeing to negotiate with the U.S. and Britain on the issue of stopping nuclear testing on October 31. In his answers to "Pravda," Comrade Khrushchev clearly stated that the purpose of such negotiations should be to sign an agreement on the permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing by all countries, rejected the absurd conditions put forward by the U.S. and British governments, and suggested that the duration of the negotiations be agreed upon in advance. All of this is very reasonable and fully in line with the wishes of the people of all countries.

The people of the world urgently demand an end to nuclear weapons testing. The recently concluded Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament put forward the resounding slogan "Oppose nuclear testing is to oppose nuclear war." For this purpose, the people of the world must not be deceived by the empty talk of the U.S. and British governments about suspending nuclear weapons testing for one year, but must continue to fight tirelessly and force the U.S. and Britain to accept the permanent cessation of testing of all types of atomic weapons and nuclear weapons at the future Geneva conference!

### 要迫使美英两国永远停试核武器

　　要迫使美英两国永远停试核武器
    苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在他的关于停止试验核武器的问题答“真理报”记者问中，一针见血地揭示了美英两国政府在停止试验核武器问题上骗人的把戏。赫鲁晓夫同志声明，苏联政府鉴于美英两国显然利用苏联停止核试验的机会来为自己取得军事优势的行动，直接违背了各国人民的意志，因而解除了苏联在进行原子武器和氢武器试验的问题上单方面承担的义务；同时宣布苏联政府为了达到签订一切国家永远停止试验各种类型的原子武器和氢武器的协定的目的，同意在今年10月31日开始和美英举行三国谈判。中国人民完全支持苏联政府在这个为全人类所关心的问题上所采取的鲜明立场和有力措施。苏联政府的态度，又一次帮助全世界人民看清了美英帝国主义的阴谋，有利于推动争取永远停止核武器试验的斗争。
    大家知道，在8月21日结束的日内瓦八国核专家会议已经得出了这样的一致结论：任何核爆炸都是可以侦察出来的，对停止核武器试验进行有效监督是完全可以实现的事情。这个有美国和英国专家参加讨论而得出的结论，不但完全证实了苏联在这个问题上所一贯坚持的观点是正确的，而且狠狠地打了美英两国政府的耳光。因为，不是别人，正是美英两国政府一向借口无法侦察核爆炸、无法对一项停止核试验的协议进行有效监督，而顽固地拒绝同苏联一起缔结停止核试验的协议。日本共同社的记者在日内瓦核专家会议结束之后评称：“由于这个专家会议的结论，苏联关于停止试验的主张得到了强有力的支持。相反的，必须认为，西方国家的反对论调……大大丧失了它的说服力。”
    美英两国最近在太平洋上进行了规模空前的一系列核武器试验，引起了各国人民普遍的愤怒和不安，而日内瓦核专家会议的结论又使它们所一口咬定的无法对核试验进行有效监督的借口，完全宣告破产。正是在这种情形下，美英两国政府才在日内瓦核专家会议结束后的第二天，分别发表声明，宣布愿意在今年10月31日开始进行一项关于停止核武器试验的谈判，并且表示将从开始谈判的第一天起停止试验一年。在美英两国政府的声明发表之后，西方的御用宣传机器照例大事渲染，夸耀这些声明是“爱好和平”的行动。英国外交大臣劳埃德还自吹自擂地说这是一个“非常重要的贡献”。好！那就让我们看看究竟是怎样的一个爱好和平的行动，怎么样的一个“非常重要的贡献”吧！
    首先，美英两国政府只是宣布要到10月31日开始谈判的那一天起才停止试验一年，而不是在它们发表声明的那一天起就立刻停止。美英两国政府如果真正有诚意停止试验的话，那么，下一道命令立刻停止一切试验活动，本是轻而易举的事情。然而，它们却是要利用这两个多月的时间，加紧进行核武器的爆炸试验。在艾森豪威尔发表了那篇声明之后，美国原子能委员会主席立即宣布，委员会正“采取必要的行动，在10月31日这个期限以前完成原来所计划的试验”。英国政府在它的声明中公开宣布要“尽可能快地”在10月31日以前完成“一连串试验”，并且在声明发表的同时，火速命令太平洋圣诞岛上英国试验队，叫他们加速工作。美英两国政府的这种行动可以被认为是爱好和平的吗？可以说是在停止核武器试验的问题上的一个“非常重要的贡献”吗？当然不可以。拆穿来说，美英两国政府的这些行动，无非是企图通过这两个多月的核试验的完成，增强它们在两个多月以后开始的谈判中的“实力地位”。
    其次，美英两国政府只是宣布暂时停止试验一年，而不是永远停止试验。为什么不多不少恰好是一年呢？如果考虑到在进行了一系列的核试验之后，必须有一段休整的时间，而一年的时间又正好是准备下一系列的核试验所必需的时间，那么，所谓停止试验一年究有多少实际意义，就可想而知了。美英两国政府所以愿意在它们目前进行的一系列核武器试验完成后，送个“顺水人情”，停试一年，其原因正在此。美国“华尔街日报”报道说：“（美国）政府认为停止试验一年不会妨碍这个国家的武器发展计划”，就是一个旁证。美英两国政府这种空有停止试验之名而无停止试验之实的虚伪行动，难道也是爱好和平，也是“非常重要的贡献”吗？
    最后，美英两国政府只是宣布它们准备通过谈判在逐年的基础上考虑停止核武器试验，必须在每年年初满足了它们所提出的条件之后，才能把停止试验的时期顺延一年，而不是通过谈判缔结一项永远有效的停止试验的协定。它们的条件是：第一，对停止核试验的侦察制度必须是“有效地执行”的；第二，必须在解决总的裁军问题方面取得“令人满意的进展”。但是，这些条件的实际意义是什么呢？就其第一个条件来说，日内瓦核专家会议已经从科学上断定了任何核爆炸都是可以侦察到的，要违反停止试验的协定而不为人所知，是不可能的，因此，根本就不发生什么“有效地执行”与否的问题。再就第二个条件来说，停止核试验同解决总的裁军问题，完全是两回事，前者是易如反掌的，后者则牵涉到一系列复杂的问题。根据以往的经验，美英两国在裁军谈判中总是出尔反尔，一直在阻挠谈判的进行，而现在美英两国政府偏偏要用解决总的裁军问题这件事，来作为把停止试验的协定顺延一年的先决条件，这不是别有用心是什么？“司马昭之心路人皆知”，美英两国政府所以提出这两个条件，无非是准备随时以监督核试验没有达到“有效”的程度或裁军问题没有取得“令人满意的进展”为借口而恢复核武器试验。美英两国政府这种在实行停止核试验之前就预伏恢复核试验的阴谋的行动，难道又可以说是爱好和平的行动，是对停止核试验问题的“非常重要的贡献”吗？
    从以上所说的看来，美英两国政府被迫于8月22日发表的声明，绝对不能证明它们已经改变了原来的顽固立场，而只能说明它们再一次玩弄欺骗手段，企图缓和全世界爱好和平的人民对它们的谴责，麻痹各国人民的警惕性。
    自从3月31日苏联宣布单方面停止核武器试验后，美英两国变本加厉地进行各种类型的核武器的爆炸试验。美国在从4月28日到7月26日的不到三个月的期间内，就进行了三十多次核武器爆炸试验。英国也进行了若干次热核武器的爆炸试验。而且，在10月31日以前，美英两国还要继续进行一系列的核武器试验。面对着美国和英国这种违背各国人民意志的行动，苏联政府遵循今年3月31日苏联最高苏维埃关于苏联单方面停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题的决议而解除了苏联单方面承担的停止核武器试验的义务。苏联政府这一行动不仅对于苏联的安全利益是必要的，而且对于各国人民的安全利益，也是必要的。谁都会懂得：面对帝国主义侵略势力空口讲和平，而不去努力发展和壮大足以保卫和平的力量，那就只会助长帝国主义侵略势力的凶焰，使和平受到危害。
    但是，苏联本着一贯争取和平，争取一切拥有核武器的国家停止试验、生产和使用核武器的精神，仍然愿意作再一次的努力，同意和美英两国在10月31日就停止核试验的问题进行谈判。赫鲁晓夫同志在答“真理报”记者问中，明确地提出了这种谈判的目的应该是签订一切国家永远停止核武器试验的协定，拒绝了美英两国政府所提出的那些荒诞无稽的条件，并且建议事先商妥谈判的期限。这一切都是十分合理的，完全符合各国人民的愿望的。
    全世界人民都迫切要求结束核武器试验，在不久以前闭幕的第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会提出了“反对核试验就是反对核战争”的响亮口号。为此目的，全世界人民不要被美英两国政府停止试验核武器一年的空谈所蒙蔽，而要再接再厉地进行斗争，强迫美英两国在未来的日内瓦会议上，接受永远停止试验一切类型的原子武器和核武器！
