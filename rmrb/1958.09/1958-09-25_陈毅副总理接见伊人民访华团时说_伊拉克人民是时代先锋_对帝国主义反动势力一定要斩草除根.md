Xinhua News Agency, September 24th. Vice Premier Chen Yi met with the entire Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation this afternoon, warmly praising the Iraqi people as pioneers of our era, whose victory dealt a severe blow to imperialism. He pointed out that the Iraqi people's victory is also the Chinese people's victory.

This was a cordial meeting filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere. During their conversation, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Head of Delegation Mahmoud repeatedly expressed that the people of the two countries will always support each other and forever consolidate and develop the unbreakable fighting friendship between the two peoples. Vice Premier Chen Yi warmly said to Head of Delegation Mahmoud: Your victory is a remarkable and great victory. In one morning, you smashed an imperialist colonialist base of aggression in the Middle East, greatly changing the face of Iraq and the entire Arab people's anti-colonialist struggle.

When Head of Delegation Mahmoud mentioned that the Iraqi people are highly vigilant against imperialist subversion activities and continue to fight to consolidate the Iraqi Republic, Vice Premier Chen Yi immediately said: The Chinese revolution has the same experience. We must not be lenient towards imperialist reactionary forces and must eradicate them completely. He congratulated the Iraqi people on their continuous new victories, relying on their own strength to build their country into a more beautiful and prosperous one.

The Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation is the first delegation to visit our country after the victory of the Iraqi revolution. Head of Delegation Mahmoud said that the Iraqi people will never forget the warm support given to them by the Chinese people when they were severely threatened by imperialism in the early days of their revolution. Therefore, after their country was consolidated, the Iraqi people sent their own delegation to express their deep friendship and respect to the Chinese people. He also said that the warm reception given to them by the Chinese people has made them feel not like guests in a foreign land but as if they had arrived in their own hometown. They hope to see more of the achievements and experiences of the Chinese people in building their country so that they can pass them on to the Iraqi people. Vice Premier Chen Yi extended a warm welcome to the guests from this newly emerging revolutionary country.

The friendly conversation between the hosts and guests lasted for more than an hour. Finally, Vice Premier Chen Yi proposed a toast to the fighting friendship between the two peoples, to the heavy blow inflicted on imperialism by the great Iraqi people, and to the health of Prime Minister Qasim. Head of Delegation Mahmoud also raised his glass to thank the Chinese people for their deep friendship and warm support to the Iraqi people and congratulated the Chinese people on their great victory in the struggle against US imperialist aggression.

    对帝国主义反动势力一定要斩草除根
    新华社24日讯陈毅副总理在今天下午接见伊拉克人民友好访华团全体人员时，热烈地赞扬伊拉克人民是我们这个时代的先锋，他们的胜利给了帝国主义严重的打击，并且指出伊拉克人民的胜利就是中国人民的胜利。
    这是一次充满了热烈友好气氛的亲切会见。陈毅副总理和马哈茂德团长在谈话中一再表示两国人民将永远互相支持，永远巩固和发扬两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊。陈毅副总理热情地对马哈茂德团长说：你们的胜利是一个非常了不起的伟大胜利，你们在一个早晨就粉碎了帝国主义殖民者在中东地区的一个侵略基地，使得伊拉克以至整个阿拉伯人民反殖民主义斗争的面貌都大大改观。
    当马哈茂德团长谈到伊拉克人民正在高度警惕帝国主义的颠复活动和继续为巩固伊拉克共和国而斗争时，陈毅副总理紧接着说：中国革命也有同样的经验，对帝国主义的反动势力决不能容情，一定要斩草除根。他祝贺伊拉克人民不断获得新的胜利，依靠自己的力量把他们的国家建设得更为美好和繁荣。
    伊拉克人民友好访华团是伊拉克革命胜利后来我国访问的第一个代表团。马哈茂德团长说，伊拉克人民怎么也不会忘记在他们革命初期受到帝国主义严重威胁的时候，中国人民所给予他们的热情支援，因此，当他们的国家得到巩固以后，伊拉克人民就派出自己的代表团，向中国人民表达自己的深厚情谊和敬意。他还说中国人民对他们的热情接待已经使他们感到不是作客他乡而是好像到了自己的家乡一样，他们希望更多地看到中国人民建设自己国家的成就和经验，以便转告给伊拉克人民。陈毅副总理对来自这个新兴的革命国家的客人们表示热烈欢迎。
    宾主双方充满友情的谈话一共进行了一个多小时。最后，陈毅副总理提议为两国人民的战斗友谊，为伟大的伊拉克人民给予帝国主义的沉重打击，为卡塞姆总理的健康而干杯。马哈茂德团长也举杯感谢中国人民对伊拉克人民的深厚友谊和热烈支持，祝贺中国人民在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中取得伟大胜利。
