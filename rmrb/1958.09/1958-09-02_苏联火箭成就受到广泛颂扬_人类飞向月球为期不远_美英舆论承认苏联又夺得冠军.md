Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: Socialist countries' newspapers continue to comment on the great achievement of the Soviet Union's launch of a geophysical rocket.

    The East German "Young World" pointed out that the Soviet Union's launched rocket weighed a total of 1,690 kilograms. If we recall that the American rockets launching satellites are three-stage and can only carry 15 to 17 kilograms, then the significance of the Soviet achievement is very obvious.

    The Bulgarian "Workers' Affairs" wrote that the successful launch of the rocket by the Soviet Union means that "the era of living organisms overcoming the obstacles of gravity and flying to the moon and other planets is very near."

    Romania's "Spark," "Free Romania," and "Youth Spark" also published articles congratulating the Soviet Union's new achievement.

    The "Spark" article said that the successful launch of this rocket by the Soviet Union once again demonstrates the tremendous progress of Soviet rocket technology.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: TASS reported that United Press International reported that Washington believes that the Soviet launch of a geophysical rocket is a sign that "the Russians have won another championship in one area."

    Most British newspapers pointed out that the successful launch of the Soviet single-stage geophysical rocket carrying experimental animals is an important step in the human race's start of interstellar flight.

    The "Daily Express" said in an editorial:
	"Russia's new achievement means that it has made great success in overcoming one of the biggest difficulties in space flight, which is to return the rocket to the atmosphere without burning up."

	"The Daily Herald" wrote that the news of the launch of the geophysical rocket is a signal that Russia has been leading the way in the great race to conquer space. The newspaper pointed out that American scientists have "failed" because "the Russians have virtually solved the problem of returning from space."

    苏联火箭成就受到广泛颂扬
    人类飞向月球为期不远
    美英舆论承认苏联又夺得冠军
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：社会主义国家报纸继续评论苏联发射地球物理火箭的伟大成就。
    民主德国“青年世界报”指出，苏联发射的火箭总重为一千六百九十公斤，如果回忆一下，美国发射卫星的火箭是三级而只能载重十五公斤到十七公斤，那么苏联这一成就的意义就非常明显了。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”写道，苏联发射火箭成功意味着“生物克服地心引力的障碍而飞向月球和其他星球的时期已很临近了。”
    罗马尼亚的“火花报”、“自由罗马尼亚报”和“青年火花报”也都发表文章祝贺苏联的新成就。
  “火花报”的文章说，苏联成功发射这支火箭，再次表明苏联火箭技术的巨大进步。
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社讯：合众国际社报道说，华盛顿认为这次苏联发射地球物理火箭是一个标志，它说明“俄国人又在一个方面夺得了冠军”。
    大多数英国报纸都指出，苏联这个载有试验动物的单级地球物理火箭发射成功，是人类开始星际飞行的一个重要步骤。
    “每日快报”在社论中说：
  “俄国的新成就意味着，它在克服宇宙飞行的一个最大的困难方面取得了很大成功，这就是使火箭返回大气层而不致烧毁”。
      “每日先驱报”写道，发射地球物理火箭的消息是一个信号，它表明俄国在征服宇宙空间的大竞赛中一直走在前面。报纸指出，美国科学家“失败了”，因为“俄国人实际上已经解决了从宇宙空间返回的问题”。
