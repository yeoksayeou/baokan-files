Steel Production Must Be Speeded Up

Today is September 14th. It has been fourteen days since the Party Central Committee issued its call for doubling steel production this year. Over the past fourteen days, the entire country has risen up, the whole population has been mobilized, and millions of troops have rushed to the steel front. According to incomplete statistics, the army of people involved in steel production in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions has reached more than 20 million. Striving to produce 10.7 million tons of steel has become a practical action for the entire population. Now, everyone is eagerly hoping to know: What have been the results of these days, and can the plan to double steel production be completed? Our answer to this question is: the plan to double steel production can definitely be completed, but continued arduous efforts are still needed.

According to incomplete statistics, the national average daily steel production in the first ten days of September increased by 33% compared with the first ten days of August, while the steel production in August only increased by 15% compared with July. This means that the growth rate of steel production in the first ten days of September has greatly accelerated compared with August. In terms of pig iron, a total of more than 240,000 indigenous and small blast furnaces were built nationwide from January to August. By September 10th, more than 350,000 indigenous and small blast furnaces had been built in various regions. The number of furnaces put into production and producing iron normally has also increased significantly. Among them, the number of indigenous and small blast furnaces put into production in provinces and regions such as Shanxi, Fujian, Guangxi, and Sichuan account for more than 40% of the total number of indigenous and small blast furnaces built. Provinces such as Hunan, Guizhou, Henan, Shanxi, and Sichuan have emerged with indigenous and small blast furnaces producing more than 1,000 tons of iron per day, and counties such as Lushan County in Henan have also emerged with a daily output of 1,000 tons of iron. All of these prove that high-speed growth of steel production is entirely possible, and the plan to produce 10.7 million tons of steel within the year can definitely be completed. However, this does not mean that no effort is needed. Looking at the situation of fulfilling the plan in the first ten days of September, there are still many unsatisfactory aspects. In terms of steelmaking, several large enterprises with decisive influence have not completed their plans; in terms of ironmaking, many provinces and regions have not increased the number of furnaces put into production, especially those producing iron normally, enough. These also show that the situation of steel production is still not entirely satisfactory, and needs to be speeded up.

What is particularly needed to be emphasized now is that what needs to be grasped should be grasped tightly, and only by grasping tightly can we achieve 10.7 million tons of steel. Judging from the situation in the first ten days of September, the Party committees of various provinces and autonomous regions have vigorously taken up steel production, but truly grasping tightly still requires unremitting efforts. Why is it necessary to emphasize grasping tightly? This is because: First, time is precious. There are only three and a half months left until the end of the year. “An inch of time is worth an inch of gold.” To complete the plan to produce 10.7 million tons of steel within the year, it is necessary to ensure that the monthly, ten-day, and daily plans are completed and over-fulfilled without any discount. If the plan is not completed on one day, it will add an extra burden to the next day, causing extra difficulties. This requires grasping tightly, so tightly that "every minute and second counts," and not letting any day or any hour pass by carelessly. Second, the battlefront is vast. In the past, there were few steel enterprises in our country, and most of the output came from a few key enterprises. Grasping the key points could ensure victory. Now, the steel battlefront has become a vast people's battlefront. Grasping the key points is still necessary, but it is not enough to only grasp a few key enterprises. Especially in pig iron production, more than half of the task relies on the scattered small and indigenous blast furnaces. Failure to complete the production plan of small and indigenous blast furnaces in any province or county will inevitably affect the overall situation. This situation requires leadership to grasp tightly. For a province, no prefecture should be relaxed; for a prefecture, no county should be relaxed; for a county, no township should be relaxed. Only by grasping tightly in this way can we ensure the completion of the national plan. Third, there are still many problems. Looking at the various links within the steel industry, mining, transportation, ironmaking, and steelmaking are all closely linked, and one link affects another; looking at the relationship between the steel industry and other departments, equipment manufacturing, coal supply, power supply, transportation guarantee, etc., all have a significant impact on the leap forward in the steel industry. At present, there are still many problems in all these internal and external links. Failure to grasp and solve the problems in any link will affect the overall situation. This requires grasping tightly everywhere, and not relaxing any link.

What aspects should be grasped tightly? According to the current situation, first of all, it is necessary to grasp the key. Where is the key to doubling steel production this year? From the perspective of steelmaking capacity, although efforts are still needed, the problem is relatively small. The capacity of the eighteen key steel enterprises in the country, plus the local steel enterprises and the steelmaking equipment of non-industrial departments, can completely produce 10.7 million tons of steel within the year. The key lies in pig iron. Without iron, steel cannot be made, and more than half of pig iron production depends on indigenous and small blast furnaces. At present, the situation that indigenous and small blast furnaces cannot all be put into production and cannot all produce iron normally has not fundamentally changed. This is the most important key at present. Now, a technical army of more than 10,000 people organized by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has been dispatched to various places, and many provinces and regions have also organized technical guidance groups and steel medical teams to go to the furnaces. We hope that all localities will give full play to the technical strength of these working groups and guidance groups, so that indigenous and small blast furnaces can quickly produce iron, produce iron normally, and produce good iron. Various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should strive to put more than 50% of the built indigenous and small blast furnaces into production around September 20th, and ensure that more than 50% of them can produce iron normally, so that the pig iron production of indigenous and small blast furnaces nationwide will make a leap in September.

In order to rapidly increase pig iron production and ensure steelmaking needs, five key aspects should be grasped in pig iron production: First, digging, rapidly organizing forces to mine, and immediately mobilizing the masses to mine any ore that has been proven to be usable through simple verification; second, smelting, solving production technology problems, rapidly producing iron, and producing iron normally; third, transporting, transporting ore and coking coal to the furnace in a timely manner to ensure that production is not delayed; fourth, coal, the coking coal and anthracite coal needed by the steel industry should be given priority supply; fifth, building, the indigenous and small blast furnaces that are still under construction need to be speeded up and put into production as soon as possible. In addition to these five major keys, attention should also be paid to the production of ferrosilicon, ferromanganese, and refractory materials.

Secondly, it is necessary to grasp "large-scale bumper harvests." After several months, especially the recent period of hard work, many bumper harvest "red flags" have emerged on the steel front. Promoting these bumper harvest experiences and striving for "large-scale bumper harvests" is an important guarantee for completing the steel leap forward plan. In terms of open-hearth steelmaking, the open-hearth utilization coefficient (the output per square meter of hearth area per day and night) of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant is as high as 14.225 tons, while the open-hearth utilization coefficient of some steel plants is still less than 10 tons. If the open-hearth utilization coefficient of steelmaking enterprises across the country, especially the eighteen key steelmaking enterprises, can reach the level of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, how much steel will be increased! What Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant can do, other factories should also be able to do. In terms of pig iron production, the blast furnace utilization coefficient (the number of cubic meters of effective blast furnace volume required to produce one ton of iron per day and night) of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant reached 0.517; the average daily output of the "Leap Forward" small blast furnace of Wanfu Iron and Steel Plant in Wanyuan County, Sichuan Province in mid-August reached 2.45 tons, both leading the country's similar blast furnaces. We also have reason to require large and small blast furnaces across the country to learn from these "red flags" and strive to catch up with the advanced level as soon as possible. All localities must seize the opportunity to organize the promotion of these advanced experiences and local advanced experiences, and strive for "large-scale bumper harvests."

Finally, it is necessary to grasp political and ideological work. Doubling steel production is a bold plan to strive for advancement. To achieve this plan, there must be a thought of striving for advancement, there must be a communist style of breaking superstitions and daring to think and act, there must be a spirit of overcoming all difficulties and forging ahead, and the spirit of communist cooperation must be promoted, which requires strengthening political and ideological work. If political and ideological work is not grasped tightly, the guidelines and policies cannot be implemented, and all well-conceived technical measures and organizational measures will be difficult to implement. Especially when the movement of the whole people running steel has gone deep and the technical measures and organizational measures are becoming more and more burdensome, grasping political and ideological work cannot be ignored in the slightest.

The current situation is changing rapidly. Not long ago, seeing the blast furnaces standing tall across the country, the molten iron flowing, and the steel flowers splashing, the leap forward of the steel industry was very exciting. All comrades on the steel front, nearly half a month has passed in September. The production plan for September must be completed, not a ton less, and efforts must be made to over-fulfill it. As long as the plan for September can be completed, production in October can make a greater leap. If the plan for October is completed, the two months of November and December will not be difficult. Seize the time, the second half of September is a moment of great importance. Let us make persistent efforts, speed up, and welcome the ninth anniversary of the National Day by over-producing more steel!

### 钢铁生产必须快马加鞭

    钢铁生产必须快马加鞭
    今天是9月14日。屈指算来，党中央关于今年钢产加番的号召已经公布十四天了。十四天来，举国上下，全民奋起，千军万马，奔赴钢铁战线。根据不完全的统计，各省、市、自治区投入钢铁生产的大军已达二千万人以上。为生产一千零七十万吨钢而奋斗，已经成为全民的实际行动。现在，大家都迫切地希望知道：这些天来的战果如何，钢产加番的计划能不能完成？我们对这个问题的答复是：钢产加番的计划一定能够完成，但是还需要继续作艰巨的努力。
    据不完全的统计，9月上旬全国平均每日钢产量比8月上旬提高了33％，而8月份钢产量只比7月份增长了15％。这就是说，9月上旬钢产量的增长速度已经比8月份大大地加快了。在生铁方面，全国1至8月共建成土高炉和小高炉二十四万多个，到9月10日，各地建成的土高炉和小高炉已达三十五万多个。投入生产和正常出铁的炉子也已显著增加，其中山西、福建、广西和四川等省区投入生产的土高炉和小高炉，都占已建成的土高炉和小高炉总数的40％以上。全国已出现了湖南、贵州、河南、山西、四川等土高炉和小高炉日产铁千吨以上的省份，也出现了一些像河南鲁山县一样的日产千吨铁的县。这些都证明了钢铁产量的高速度增长是完全可能的，年内生产一千零七十万吨钢的计划一定能完成。但是，这并不等于说就不需要努力了。拿9月上旬完成计划的情况来看，也还有许多不能令人满意的地方。在炼钢方面，好几个有决定影响的大企业没有完成计划；在炼铁方面，不少省区投入生产、特别是正常出铁的炉子还增加得不够多。这些又都说明钢铁生产的情况还不能尽如人意，还需要快马加鞭。
    现在特别需要强调的是，要抓就要抓紧，只有抓紧才能拿到一千零七十万吨钢。从9月上旬的情况来看，各个省和自治区的党委都已大张旗鼓地抓起钢铁来，但真正抓紧，还有待于不懈的努力。为什么要强调抓紧呢？这是因为：第一，时间宝贵。现在距年底只有三个半月了，“一刻值千金”，要完成年内生产一千零七十万吨钢的计划，必须保证每月、每旬、每日的计划都不折不扣地完成和超额完成。如果有一天完不成计划，就给另一天增加了额外的负担，造成了额外的困难。这就需要抓紧，紧到“分秒必争”，不让任何一天、任何一个小时马马虎虎地过去。第二，战线广阔。过去我国的钢铁企业为数不多，大部分产量出在几个重点企业的身上，抓住重点就能稳操胜券。现在的钢铁战线已经成为一个广阔的全民战线。抓住重点仍然是必要的，但只抓住几个重点企业还不够。特别是在生铁生产方面，半数以上的任务靠那些星罗棋布的小高炉和土高炉来完成。任何一个省、一个县小高炉和土高炉的生产计划不能完成，都势必影响全局。这种情况就要求领导上抓紧。就一个省来说，哪一个专区也不放松；就一个专区来说，哪一个县也不放松；就一个县来说，哪一个乡也不放松。只有这样抓紧，才能确保完成国家计划。第三，问题尚多。从钢铁工业内部各个环节来看，采矿、运输、炼铁、炼钢都是紧密联系，一环影响一环的；从钢铁工业同其他各个部门的联系来看，设备制造、煤炭供应、电力供应、运输保证等等，对钢铁工业的跃进也都有举足轻重的影响。目前，所有这些内部和外部的环节都还存在不少问题，哪一个环节的问题没有抓紧解决，都会牵动全盘。这就要求处处抓紧，哪一个环节也不放松。
    抓紧，从哪些方面抓呢？根据目前情况来看，首先，要抓关键。年内钢产加番的关键在哪里呢？从炼钢能力来看，固然还需努力，但比较起来，问题不大。全国十八个重点炼钢企业加上地方炼钢企业和非工业部门炼钢设备的能力算在一起，年内生产一千零七十万吨钢是完全可能的。关键在于生铁，没有铁就炼不成钢，而生铁的产量半数以上要靠土高炉和小高炉。目前，土高炉和小高炉不能全部投入生产和不能全部正常出铁的情况还没有根本改变。这是当前关系最大的关键。现在，冶金工业部组织的一支一万多人的技术大军已经分赴各地，许多省区也组织了技术辅导团、钢铁医疗队开到炉前。我们希望各地充分发挥这些工作团、辅导团的技术力量，使土高炉和小高炉迅速出铁、正常出铁、出好铁。各个省、市、自治区应该争取在9月20日左右，力争有50％以上建成的土高炉和小高炉投入生产，并且做到其中又有50％以上能够正常出铁，使全国土高炉和小高炉的生铁产量在9月份来一个飞跃。
    为了迅速增产生铁，保证炼钢需要，在生铁生产中又应该抓五个关键：一是挖，迅速组织力量采矿，凡是经过简单化验证明可用的矿石，立即发动群众开采；二是炼，解决生产技术问题，迅速出铁，并且正常出铁；三是运，把矿石和焦煤及时运到炉前，保证不耽误生产；四是煤，钢铁工业需要的焦煤、白煤，应该优先得到供应。五是建，还在建造的土高炉和小高炉需要快马加鞭，尽早投入生产。此外，除了这五大关键，还要注意矽铁、锰铁和耐火材料的生产。
    其次，要抓“大面积丰收”。经过几个月来，特别是最近一个时期的奋战，钢铁战线上已经出现了许多丰产“红旗”。推广这些丰产经验，争取“大面积丰收”，是完成钢铁跃进计划的重要保证。在平炉炼钢方面，上海第三钢铁厂的平炉利用系数（每一平方公尺炉底面积一昼夜的产量）高达十四点二二五吨，而有些钢厂的平炉利用系数却还不到十吨。如果全国的炼钢企业，特别是十八个重点炼钢企业的平炉利用系数，都能达到上钢三厂的水平，就将增产多少钢呵！上钢三厂能够做到的，别的厂也应该能够做到。在生铁生产方面，本溪第一炼铁厂的高炉利用系数（每一昼夜出一吨铁所需要的高炉有效容积的立方公尺数）达到零点五一七；四川省万源县万福钢铁厂“跃进号”小高炉8月中旬平均日产量达二点四五吨，都走在全国同类高炉的前面。我们也有理由要求全国的大小高炉向这些“红旗”学习，力争尽快地赶上先进水平。各地方必须抓紧组织这些先进经验和当地的先进经验的推广，力争“大面积丰收”。
    最后，要抓政治思想工作。钢铁生产翻一番是一个大胆的力争上游的计划。要实现这个计划，必须有力争上游的思想，必须有破除迷信、敢想敢做的共产主义风格，必须有排除万难、奋发向前的精神，必须发扬共产主义的协作精神，这就需要加强政治思想工作。政治思想工作不抓紧，方针政策不能贯彻，一切设想得很好的技术措施和组织措施也难行通。特别是在全民办钢铁的运动已经走向深入，技术措施和组织措施越来越繁重的时候，抓紧政治思想工作是丝毫也不能忽视的。
    现在的形势一日千里。曾几何时，看大江南北高炉林立，铁水流，钢花溅，钢铁工业的跃进十分地激奋人心。钢铁战线上的全体同志们，9月份已经过去快半个月了。9月份的生产计划务必完成，一吨也不能少，而且要力争超额完成。只要9月份能够完成计划，10月份的生产就可以来一个更大的飞跃。10月份的计划完成了，11、12两个月也就不难了。赶前不赶后，9月份下半月是关系重大的时刻。让我们再接再厉，快马加鞭，以超额生产更多的钢铁来迎接国庆的第九周年吧！
