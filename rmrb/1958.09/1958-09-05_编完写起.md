　　The Hunting Dog Who Knows His Master's Temper
　　While the American aggressive bloc is actively plotting new provocations against the Chinese people, its running dog, Lee Seung-man’s “Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,” is even clamoring about the "possibility" of attacking the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
　　The hunting dog always runs ahead of its master. However, its barking precisely exposes its master's conspiracy.
   
    Chiang Kai-shek's New Use
    In order to create a pretext for new provocations against our country, the United States has stooped to such shamelessness as to plot a despicable trick, arranging for Chiang Kai-shek's planes to attack American warships while masquerading as our country's planes.
    This is probably the development of the American theory of "Chiang Kai-shek representing China."

　　熟悉主人脾气的猎犬
    当美国侵略集团正在积极策划对中国人民进行新挑衅的时候，它的走狗李承晚的“参谋长联席会议主席”居然也在叫嚣“有可能”进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    猎犬总是跑在主子的前面的。不过它的吠声倒正好暴露了它主子的阴谋。
   蒋介石的新用途
    美国为了制造对我国进行新挑衅的借口，竟无耻到这个地步，阴谋安排一幕卑鄙的苦肉计，让蒋介石的飞机假冒我国的飞机攻击美国军舰。
    这大概是美国所谓“蒋介石代表中国”的理论的发挥。
