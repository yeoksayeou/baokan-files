    "Command the Blast Furnace Gas to Yield Oil!"
    Small blast furnaces are scattered across the country, and it is clear that most of the rolling blast furnace gas is being released as "waste gas." Some students majoring in synthetic petroleum at the Department of Coal Conversion of the Beijing Petroleum Institute thought, "How wonderful it would be if this gas could be synthesized into oil!" But for them, synthesizing oil from small blast furnace gas was something they had neither heard of nor seen before.
    However, these young people dared to think and dared to do. More than a month ago, they started this unusual experiment. They wanted to link petroleum and steel marshals, and boldly proposed the slogan: "Command the Blast Furnace Gas to Yield Oil!" They experimented again and again. Initially, many experiments failed, and some professors who were originally against the students "messing around" seemed to be proven right. However, with the encouragement and support of the Party organization, the young people did not retreat in the face of failure and ridicule. They conducted a comprehensive analysis and research from theoretical and technical perspectives again. Failure made them even more certain that oil could be synthesized. The problem was still in the experiment. After more than a month of hard work, the experiment finally succeeded, and the quality of the gasoline and diesel synthesized was very good. Under favorable conditions, the price of synthesizing oil from small blast furnace gas is approximately equal to the price of iron produced in the same furnace.
    Now, they are using the blast furnace gas from the small blast furnace of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology to synthesize gasoline and diesel. At the same time, they are continuing to study better methods for synthesizing gasoline and diesel from blast furnace gas using indigenous methods, and they are also studying a low-cost equipment so that small blast furnaces across the country can use it.

    “喝令高炉煤气交出油来！”
    全国各地已有的小高炉星罗棋布，眼看着这些小高炉滚滚的煤气大部分都被当作“废气”放掉了。北京石油学院煤制系人造石油专业有的学生看到这种情况这样想：“如果能把这些煤气合成出油来该多么好！”可是用小高炉煤气合成油，在他们来说也是既没有听说过更没有见过的事。
    但是这些青年人敢想就敢干，一个多月前，他们开始了这项不平常的试验。他们要石油和钢铁元帅挂上钩，豪迈地提出：“喝令高炉煤气交出油来！”的口号，一次再一次的试验。开始，许多次的试验都失败了，有些本来就反对学生们这样“胡搞”的教授，好像是对了。可是，在党组织的鼓励和支持下，青年人没在失败和嘲笑面前后退，他们再次的从理论和技术上进行了全面的分析研究，失败使他们更加肯定能够合成出油来。毛病仍在试验上。经过一个多月的苦战，试验终于获得了成功，而且合成出来的汽油和柴油质量很好。在情况良好的条件下，从小高炉煤气中合成油的价格约可与同炉所炼出铁的价格相等。
    现在，他们正在用北京钢铁工业学院小高炉煤气合成汽油和柴油，同时，还正在继续研究用高炉煤气土法合成汽油和柴油的较好的方法，并且正在研究一种造价低廉的设备，以便全国各地小高炉都可应用。
