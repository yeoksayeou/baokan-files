Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 16th: The Dalai Lama on the 14th angrily condemned the crimes of American imperialism in carrying out military provocations and war threats against our country in the Taiwan Strait area. The Dalai Lama said: I and all the people of Tibet resolutely oppose this evil act of interfering in our internal affairs and undermining world peace. He warned American imperialism that if they stubbornly close their eyes and refuse to see the strength of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world, they will only bring destruction upon themselves in the end.

The Dalai Lama made a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 14th at Ganden Monastery, more than 40 kilometers east of Lhasa, in support of Premier Zhou's statement. He arrived at Ganden Monastery half a month ago to participate in the debating activities for this year's "Geshe" degree, the highest degree in Tibetan Lamaism.

The Dalai Lama said: Premier Zhou's statement is a solemn and powerful warning to American imperialism, and it represents the common will of the 600 million Chinese people. He picked up the Tibetan documents of Premier Zhou's statement and the relevant People's Daily editorial placed in front of him, and said seriously: Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are Chinese territory, and it is a matter of course for us to liberate our own territory. It is aggression to station troops on other people's territory, and American imperialism is doing just that.

After citing many historical facts to prove that American imperialism is nothing more than a paper tiger that appears strong but is weak inside, the Dalai Lama continued: We advocate peace, but we are not afraid of war. American imperialism still vainly attempts to intimidate the Chinese people with atomic weapons, attempting to kill and injure more peace-loving people. From a religious point of view, this is an extremely despicable criminal act, which religious people resolutely oppose and must oppose.

At the end of his speech, the Dalai Lama also condemned the crimes of American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents who conspired to instigate a small group of reactionary elements in Tibet to carry out subversive activities and undermine the peaceful life of the Tibetan people.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 16th: Panchen Erdeni issued a written statement on the 15th at Deqing Podrang in Shigatse, wholeheartedly supporting Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area and opposing the American imperialism's acts of aggression against our country.

Panchen Erdeni said: "Now, in the international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the imperialists' colonialist policies have been completely defeated, and the flames of the anti-colonialist national liberation movement are burning everywhere in the world. The era of imperialist rampage is gone forever. In order to defend the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the coastal islands of our country must not be allowed to be occupied by the American imperialists. Our country's territorial waters must not be allowed to be invaded by the American imperialists. Our government has every right to take all measures to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands belonging to our country. If American imperialism dares to create war in the Taiwan Strait, it will surely suffer a more miserable defeat than in the Korean War and the Middle East in the face of the powerful 600 million Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world."

In his written statement, Panchen Erdeni called on all the people of Tibet to unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strengthen the unity between the Tibetan and Han nationalities and within Tibet, expand the anti-imperialist and patriotic united front, always be vigilant, and wage a resolute struggle against the imperialist elements.

    拥护政府声明反对美国侵略
    达赖、班禅发表谈话
    新华社拉萨16日电　达赖喇嘛14日愤怒谴责美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁的罪行。达赖喇嘛说：对这种干涉我国内政，破坏世界和平的罪恶行为，我和全西藏人民都坚决反对。他警告美帝国主义，如果它们硬要闭着眼睛不看中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的力量，最后只有自取灭亡。
    达赖喇嘛14日在拉萨东郊四十多公里的噶丹寺向新华社记者发表了拥护周总理声明的谈话。他在半个月前来到噶丹寺参加今年考取西藏喇嘛教最高学位“格西”的辩经活动。
    达赖喇嘛说：周总理的声明是对美帝国主义的严正的有力警告，它表现了六亿中国人民的共同意志。他拿起放在面前的周总理声明和人民日报有关社论的藏文文件，并且严肃地说：台湾和澎湖列岛是中国的领土，我们解放自己的领土是天经地义的事，在别人的领土上驻扎军队才是侵略，而美帝国主义正是这样。
    在引用了许多历史事实证明美帝国主义只不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎以后，达赖喇嘛接着说：我们主张和平，但也不怕战争，美帝国主义还妄想用原子武器来恫吓中国人民，企图杀伤更多的和平人民，从宗教的观点来说，这是极端卑鄙的犯罪行为，宗教徒都坚决反对，也是必须反对的。
    达赖喇嘛在发表谈话的最后还斥责了美蒋特务分子阴谋指使西藏一小撮反动分子在西藏进行颠复活动，破坏西藏人民的和平生活的罪行。
    新华社拉萨16日电　班禅额尔德尼15日在日喀则的德庆颇章发表书面谈话，竭诚拥护周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，反对美帝国主义对我国的侵略行为。
    班禅额尔德尼说：“现在，在东风压倒西风的国际形势下，帝国主义者的殖民主义政策已经遭到了彻底的失败，全世界反殖民主义的民族解放运动的怒火正在到处燃烧着，帝国主义者横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了。为了保卫我国领土主权的完整，我国台湾、澎湖列岛和沿海岛屿绝不容许美帝继续霸占，我国领海绝不容许美帝继续侵犯。我国政府完全有权采取一切措施解放台湾和属于我国的沿海岛屿。美帝国主义如果敢于在台湾海峡制造战争，就一定要在强大的六亿中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民面前，遭到比在朝鲜战场和中东地区更惨的失败。”
    班禅额尔德尼在书面谈话中，号召全西藏人民紧密团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，加强藏、汉民族之间和西藏内部的团结，扩大反帝爱国统一战线，随时提高警惕，向帝国主义分子作坚决的斗争。
