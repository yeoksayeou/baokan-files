Congratulations on the First International Day of the Deaf
Chairman of the China Welfare Association for the Deaf, Wu Yunfu

September 28th is the first International Day of the Deaf, a festival for deaf people all over the world to strengthen unity and friendship. Deaf people across the country, filled with unparalleled excitement and pride, are enthusiastically conducting celebrations for the first International Day of the Deaf under the leadership of the Party and the government. In order to welcome their own festival, and to thank the Party and the government for their care and love for the deaf masses, deaf people in various places have enthusiastically plunged into the current upsurge of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. They are working hard day and night, hoping to present their labor achievements to the Party on the International Day of the Deaf. We would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations to the deaf comrades who are actively producing, working hard, and studying hard on the industrial, agricultural, and other fronts.

It is only natural that the deaf masses are deeply moved by the celebration of the International Day of the Deaf in our country. Because before liberation, most deaf people not only could not find work or receive education, and lived a life of wandering, hunger, and cold; but also suffered discrimination and abuse from their families and society. After liberation, the tragic fate of the deaf masses suffering discrimination and exploitation is gone forever. While carrying out huge economic recovery and construction work, the Party and the government have carried out a series of work in the areas of labor production, cultural education, medical prevention, and treatment for deaf people, so that the material and cultural living conditions of the deaf masses have been greatly improved. No wonder the deaf and mute employees of the Tianjin Hebei District Deaf and Mute Wire Drawing Factory, after seeing the joint notice issued by the nine units including the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central Government regarding the celebration of the first International Day of the Deaf in the newspaper, immediately boiled over and decided to work hard for forty days to double the wire drawing production task to present it to the Party. Some old deaf and mute workers said with tears in their eyes at the symposium: "We were discriminated against in the old society. Today, celebrating the Day of the Deaf nationwide proves that our social status has undergone a fundamental change. This is inseparable from the care of the Party and the government. We must take practical actions to repay the care of the Party and the government."

In the nine years since liberation, with the rapid development of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, the welfare cause for the deaf has achieved certain successes. Especially in the current upsurge of the whole people running industry, the whole people running education, and the whole people marching toward science and culture, miracles have appeared everywhere in the welfare cause for the deaf.

In terms of organizing the deaf to participate in labor production: At present, deaf people with labor capacity in rural areas have participated in labor production with the development of agricultural cooperation and people's communes. In most cities, deaf people who can participate in labor have been organized to participate in production. Some cities with relatively poor production foundations are also starting to organize deaf people with labor power to participate in production. For example, in order to dedicate to the first International Day of the Deaf, the Labor Bureau and the Civil Affairs Bureau of Xi'an City issued a "Joint Notice on Arranging and Absorbing Unemployed Deaf People to Participate in Labor Production" to the city, and decided to build a new deaf production unit in each of the three urban areas before the International Day of the Deaf, and also expanded the New Life Comprehensive Factory. The elderly, disabled, and homeless deaf people in other places have also been placed in nursing homes and people's commune happiness homes, so that they can spend their happy old age in peace.

In terms of developing the cultural and educational cause for the deaf: In 1957, there were 70 schools for the deaf and mute, with more than 6,000 deaf and mute students. After the Great Leap Forward, most of the deaf and mute children in most cities were basically enrolled in school. Counties and cities that have not established schools for the deaf and mute are also opening them. For example, Heilongjiang Province not only opened schools for the deaf and mute in Qiqihar, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Suihua and other cities and counties, but also decided to carry out literacy work for deaf people in rural areas in stages and batches. Shenyang City originally had one school for the deaf and mute and one private school for the deaf and mute, and is now planning to add three private schools for the deaf and mute and two vocational schools to popularize education among the deaf in the city.

In addition, in order to standardize the sign language of the deaf and mute, the China Welfare Association for the Deaf and Mute established the "Deaf Sign Language Reform Committee", which is creating a set of "Chinese Finger Alphabet Scheme" for the deaf and is studying and formulating a set of unified sign language scheme based on the local dialects and gestures of the deaf in various places, preparing to promote it nationwide in stages and batches. We have also established the "Preparatory Committee of the China Deaf Sports Association" to promote and carry out sports activities for the deaf. With the construction of organizational institutions, many cities have also established clubs, preparing rich and colorful cultural and recreational lives for the deaf.

In terms of preventing and treating deafness: In recent years, thanks to the attention of the Party and the government, the incidence of acute infectious diseases has decreased year by year. The health department has also conducted investigations and research on noise deafness and has carried out work such as training hearing for deaf and mute children. The Eleventh People's Hospital affiliated to the Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine has achieved remarkable results in treating neurogenic deafness and muteness with acupuncture therapy, a valuable medical heritage of our country. After treatment, among 182 deaf and mute people, 50 deaf and mute people who could not speak before learned to speak due to improved hearing; 94 deaf and mute people had improved hearing and could hear sounds; the effective rate reached 79.12%. For example, Zhou Xiaolong, who had been deaf for 20 years, learned to say "Long live Chairman Mao" and could sing the song "Socialism is Good" after two months of treatment due to improved hearing. Twenty-six students with residual hearing in the Second Deaf and Mute School in Beijing also sang fast-rhythm talks and cross-talk on the street after hearing training to promote that we must liberate Taiwan. The masses were deeply moved when they heard it and said: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the iron tree has truly blossomed, and the dumb has spoken!"

The major achievements made in the welfare cause for the deaf in recent years have eloquently proved that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can there be a happy and beautiful life. Therefore, many deaf masses are actively working hard to overcome the various difficulties caused by the loss of hearing function, daring to think and act, boldly creating and inventing, and many advanced figures and advanced deeds have emerged. For example, deaf and mute worker Comrade Cai Jinlong is an eighth-grade mold fitter at the Shanghai Equipment Factory of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. He once improved the sawtooth comb holder in the keyboard perforation machine (a type of telegraph machine), increasing production efficiency by 84 times. When manufacturing the Great Northern Telegraph Machine, Comrade Cai Jinlong also manufactured a new punching die milling machine. Because of his continuous improvement of tools and improved work efficiency, he has been repeatedly rated as an advanced worker and labor model in the factory, and was honorably selected as a representative to attend the National Advanced Workers Conference of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications held in Beijing. Bai Huiming, a young deaf and mute worker at the Guilin Aromatic Factory, created a crushing machine when refining oil crops, increasing output by 21 times. Gao Puxian, a deaf and mute worker in the fitter group of the Hanyang Machine Factory, used waste materials to manufacture a double-headed electric saw, increasing work efficiency by 10 times.

In the upsurge of the cultural revolution, many literacy activists who insisted on running schools diligently and thriftily, running schools by the masses, and studying while working also emerged among the deaf masses. For example, Comrade Wang Shouli, a deaf and mute worker at the No. 8 State-owned Rubber Factory in Changchun City, has made many contributions to eliminating illiteracy among the deaf for six years due to his spare time from production and labor. Therefore, he has been rated as a deaf and mute literacy activist, advanced teacher, and advanced worker for three times, and has been rewarded by the Party and the government. He started from scratch in running schools, developing from eight students to fifty-six students, without using a penny of the state's money. Any difficulties were overcome by his strong sense of career.

Comrade Wang Shouli is not only a model of running schools diligently and thriftily, but also a skilled organizer of deaf production. In the past month or so, he has promoted more than 50 deaf people to participate in social welfare production. He also often helps the factory to do ideological education for deaf and mute workers.

Tang Junping, an educator for the deaf and mute in Nanchang City, assisted the Nanchang Deaf Association in eliminating illiteracy and semi-literacy among the deaf in Nanchang City. When publicizing the general line, he organized a propaganda team of the blind, deaf, and mute. The blind sang leaping fast-rhythm talks, and the deaf danced "Socialism is Good", which caused a sensation in Nanchang City. Someone once wrote a poem in the newspaper to praise: "The red flag is flying in the wind, the gongs and drums are beating loudly, the deaf, dumb, and blind are leaping forward, and they are promoting the general line on the street; Who is not moved when they see it, who is not happy when they see it, the sun of the general line is shining brightly, and it shines brightly on everyone's heart."

These advanced deaf producers and advanced workers who have emerged in the tide of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution are just a few representatives of the thousands of advanced deaf people.

Deaf comrades: We must not be satisfied with the achievements we have made. Currently, our country's whole people are leaping forward. Under the shining of the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," industrial and agricultural production is leaping forward at an unprecedented rate of development; especially since American imperialism has carried out military provocations and war threats in our country's Taiwan Strait region, the people of the whole country are even more enthusiastic and high-spirited. Under this revolutionary situation, our deaf comrades must make persistent efforts, further improve our socialist consciousness, eliminate residual inferiority complex, cultivate revolutionary optimism, actively respond to the Party's call, and contribute all our wisdom and strength in the movement to vigorously develop the iron and steel industry and vigorously run people's communes; and enthusiastically participate in the national armed forces and be prepared to respond to the sacred call to defend the motherland at any time. Advanced deaf producers in various places must not be arrogant or impetuous, maintain their glory, and strive for greater glory. Deaf comrades who work in industry, agriculture, and other production fronts must go all out, learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced, establish the communist style of daring to think and dare to act, and make new and greater achievements in the cause of socialist construction of the motherland!

Deaf workers in various places must fully realize that welfare work for the deaf is a new work. With the strong support of the Party and the government in recent years, although major progress has been made, it is still far from meeting the needs of socialist construction and the demands of the deaf masses, and it is still a lagging link in our country's various socialist construction undertakings. This requires all cadres who do deaf work to go all out, aim high, establish a high sense of career, do a comprehensive job in the social welfare, cultural education, and medical prevention and treatment of the deaf, and further adapt to the needs of the socialist construction cause of the motherland.

    祝贺第一次国际聋人节
    中国聋哑人福利会主任委员  伍云甫
    9月28日是第一次国际聋人节，这是全世界聋人加强团结和友谊的节日。全国各地聋人怀着无比的兴奋和自豪的情感，在党和政府的领导下，热烈地进行着第一次国际聋人节的庆祝活动。为了迎接自己的节日，为了感谢党和政府对聋人群众的关怀爱护，各地聋人都以无比的热情，积极投入了当前技术革命和文化革命的高潮。日日夜夜进行紧张愉快的劳动，想用自己的劳动成果，在国际聋人节日向党献礼。我们谨向工业、农业及其他各个战线上积极生产，努力工作，努力学习的聋人同志们致以衷心的祝贺。
    聋人群众对在我国庆祝国际聋人节，受到十分深刻的感动是很自然的。因为在解放前，大多数聋人不但找不到工作，受不到教育，过着漂泊流浪、忍饥受寒的生活；而且备受家庭社会的歧视和虐待。解放以后，聋人群众受歧视受剥削的悲惨命运，就一去不复返了。党和政府在进行巨大的经济恢复和建设工作的同时，对聋人的劳动生产、文化教育、医疗防治等方面，进行了一系列的工作，使聋人群众在物质文化生活条件上都有了很大的改善。无怪乎天津市河北区聋哑拔丝厂的聋哑职工，从报纸上看到中央内务部等九个单位发布关于庆祝第一次国际聋人节的联合通知以后，马上沸腾起来，决定苦战四十天，将拔丝生产任务翻一番向党献礼。有的聋哑老工人在座谈会上流着眼泪说：“我们在旧社会是受歧视的人，今天在全国范围庆祝聋人节，证明我们的社会地位已有根本的改变，这是与党和政府的关怀分不开的。我们一定要以实际行动，来报答党和政府的关怀。”
    解放九年来，随着我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的迅速发展，聋人福利事业获得了一定的成就。特别在当前全民办工业、全民办教育、全民向科学文化大进军的高潮中，聋人福利事业也到处出现了奇迹。
    在组织聋人参加劳动生产方面：目前，农村有劳动能力的聋人，随着农业合作化及人民公社的发展，都已参加了劳动生产。大部分城市，能参加劳动的聋人，都已组织起来参加生产。有些生产基础较差的城市，也都正在着手把有劳动力的聋人组织起来参加生产。如西安市为向第一次国际聋人节献礼，劳动局和民政局，向全市发出了“关于安置和吸收无业聋人参加劳动生产的联合通知”，并决定国际聋人节前在三个城区各新建一个聋人生产单位，还扩建了新生综合工厂。其他各地对年老、残废、无依无靠的聋人，也都分别安置在养老院和人民公社幸福院，使他们安度幸福的晚年。
    在发展聋人文化教育事业方面：1957年有聋哑学校七十所，聋哑学生六千多人。大跃进以后，大部分城市的聋哑儿童，基本上都入了学。没有设立聋哑学校的县市，也都正在开办。如黑龙江省，不仅在齐齐哈尔、佳木斯、牡丹江、绥化等市县开办了聋哑学校，还决定分期分批在农村中对聋人开展扫盲工作。沈阳市原有一所聋哑学校和一所民办聋哑学校，现在正在筹划增设三所民办聋哑学校，两所业余学校，以在全市聋人中普及教育。
    此外，为了使聋哑人手语规范化，中国聋哑人福利会成立了“聋人手语改革委员会”，正在为聋人创设出一套“汉语手指字母方案”，并根据各地聋人方言手势，研究制订一套统一手势语方案，准备分期分批在全国推行。我们还成立了“中国聋人体育协会筹备会”，推动和开展聋人的体育活动。不少城市随着组织机构的建设，还成立俱乐部，为聋人准备了丰富多彩的文化娱乐生活。
    在防治聋症方面：近几年来，由于党和政府的重视，急性传染病的发病率已逐年降低，卫生部门还为噪音聋进行了调查研究，对聋哑儿童进行了训练听力等工作。上海中医学院附属第十一人民医院，运用我国的宝贵医学遗产——针刺疗法治疗神经性聋哑，获得了显著效果。一百八十二个聋哑人，经过治疗，有五十个聋哑人原来不会说话，因听力好转，学会了说话；九十四个聋哑人听力好转，能听到声音；有效率达79.12％。如聋了二十年的周小龙，治疗两个月，因听力好转，已学会说“毛主席万岁”，并能唱“社会主义好”的歌曲。北京市第二聋哑学校有残余听力的二十六名学生，进行听觉训练后，也能在街头唱快板，说相声，宣传我们一定要解放台湾。群众听到深受感动，都说：“在毛主席的领导下，真正使铁树开了花，哑吧说了话！”
    几年来，聋人福利事业所取得的重大成就雄辩地证明了只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，才能有幸福美好的生活。因此，不少聋人群众都在积极地努力克服因听觉机能丧失而带来的各种困难，敢想敢干，大胆地创造发明，涌现了不少的先进人物和先进事迹。如聋哑工人蔡金龙同志，是邮电部上海器材厂的八级模子钳工，他曾改进键盘作孔机（电报机的一种）里的锯齿形梳齿梗，使生产效率提高八十四倍。在制造大北式发报机时，蔡金龙同志又制造出一具新的冲模铣床。由于他不断改进工具，提高工作效率，因此一再被评为该厂的先进工作者、劳动模范，并曾光荣地被选为代表出席了在北京召开的邮电部全国先进工作者会议。桂林市芳香厂青年聋哑工人白惠明，在提炼油料作物时，创造了打碎机，提高产量二十一倍。汉阳机器厂钳工组聋哑工人高普咸，用废料制造了双头电锯，提高工作效率十倍。
    在文化革命高潮中，聋人群众中同样涌现了不少坚持勤俭办学、群众办学、勤工俭学的扫盲积极分子。如长春市国营第八橡胶厂聋哑工人王守立同志，六年来由于他在生产劳动之余，为扫除聋人文盲做了许多贡献，因此三次被评为聋哑扫盲积极分子、先进教师、先进工作者，受到党和政府的奖励。他在办学上是白手起家，从八个学生发展到五十六个学生，没用国家一文钱，任何困难，都被他坚强的事业心所克服。
    王守立同志不仅是勤俭办学的模范，同时又是组织聋人生产的能手，最近一个多月的时间，他推动了五十多名聋人参加社会福利生产，他还经常帮助工厂做聋哑工人的思想教育工作。
    南昌市聋哑教育工作者汤俊萍同志，协助该市聋协扫除南昌市聋人中的文盲与半文盲。在宣传总路线的时候，组织了盲、聋哑人宣传队，由盲人演唱跃进快板，聋人跳“社会主义好”的舞蹈，轰动了南昌市，曾有人在报纸上做诗表扬：“红旗飘飘迎风展，锣鼓咚咚闹喧天，聋哑盲人大跃进，上街宣传总路线；谁人看了不感动，谁人看了心不欢，总路线太阳光万丈，照得人人心发亮。”
    这些在技术革命和文化革命浪潮中所涌现出来的聋人先进生产者和先进工作者，不过是千百个聋人先进人物中的几个代表人物。
    聋人同志们：我们决不能满足于已得的成就，当前我国全民大跃进，工农业生产正在党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线的光辉照耀下，以史无前例的发展速度向前飞跃；特别自美帝国主义在我国台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅和战争威胁以后，全国人民更是干劲冲天，斗志昂扬。在这种革命形势下，我们聋人同志必须再接再厉，进一步提高自己的社会主义觉悟，消除残余的自卑感，培养革命的乐观主义精神，积极响应党的号召，在大搞钢铁工业和大办人民公社的运动中，贡献出自己全部的智慧和力量；并踊跃参加全民武装，准备随时响应保卫祖国的神圣号召。各地聋人先进生产者，必须不骄不躁，保持光荣，争取更大光荣。在工业、农业以及其他各个生产战线上工作的聋人同志，必须鼓足干劲，学先进、比先进、赶先进，树立敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，在祖国社会主义建设事业里，做出新的更大的成就！
    各地聋人工作者，必须充分认识到聋人福利工作是一项新的工作。几年来，在党和政府的大力支持下，虽已获得了重大进展，但距离社会主义建设的需要与聋人群众的要求还很远，在我国各项社会主义建设事业里，还是落后的一环。这就要求做聋人工作的全体干部，鼓足干劲，力争上游，树立高度的事业心，把聋人的社会福利、文化教育、医疗防治等工作全面地做好，进一步适应祖国社会主义建设事业的需要。
