Xinhua News Agency, September 29th:

    Currently, economic crops across the country are showing a widespread scene of bumper harvests, and some have already begun to be harvested in large quantities. According to preliminary yield estimates, this year many economic crops will go from poorly completing state plans in the past to increasing production by tens of percent, from one to several times. Among them, the total output of flue-cured tobacco will increase by more than two times compared to last year, the total output of ramie will increase by 80% compared to last year, the total output of jute and kenaf will increase by more than 30% compared to last year, the total output of sugarcane will increase by one times compared to last year, the total output of sugar beet will increase by three to four times compared to last year, the total output of silkworm cocoons will increase by 50% compared to last year, the total output of tea will increase by more than 30% compared to last year, and the total output of major fruits will also greatly exceed last year's level.
    This year, due to the implementation of deep plowing in tobacco fields, early planting, sufficient supply of fertilizer and water, and continuous struggle against natural disasters, the growth of tobacco plants is particularly vigorous. Henan Province, China's largest flue-cured tobacco producing area, is expected to increase its total output of flue-cured tobacco by five to six times compared to last year. Shandong, Anhui, Guizhou, Yunnan, and other provinces are expected to increase by two to three times compared to last year. Judging from the sugar crop production in various regions, Fujian Province has great hope for an average yield of 10,000 jin of sugarcane per mu. Xianyou County in this province expects a yield of 40,000 jin per mu for 100,000 mu of sugarcane. Guangdong Province is expected to double its total sugarcane output compared to last year. In Hubei Province, the output of the first crop of ramie from more than 300,000 mu is close to the total of 340,000 dan from the three crops last year. The Datong Cooperative in Yangxin County of this province created a record of 2,020 jin per mu for two crops of ramie on 1.38 mu. The total tea output in Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Guizhou, Jiangsu, and other provinces is expected to increase by more than 36% compared to last year. Many tea gardens have launched high-yield "satellites." The Gaofeng Agricultural Cooperative in Chong'an County, Fujian Province, achieved an average yield of 1,635.9 jin of Narcissus tea per mu on a 1.14 mu tea garden. This year, due to the universal strengthening of mulberry garden management, mulberry leaf production has increased, creating favorable conditions for increased silkworm cocoon production. The cocoon production in Zhejiang, Sichuan, Guangdong, and other major mulberry and silkworm producing provinces is expected to increase by more than 20% compared to last year. Shanxi, Anhui, Hubei, and other provinces are expected to increase by more than 80% compared to last year. Henan, Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and other provinces (regions) are expected to increase by one to several times. The Jinxiang No. 2 Cooperative in Nanzhang County, Hubei Province, raised three spring silkworm seeds with an average yield of 192.8 jin of cocoons per seed. The Zhangjiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Huicheng County, Gansu Province, produced 189.3 jin of cocoons per autumn silkworm seed. The Central Cooperative in Zhengan County, Guizhou Province, raised 370 tussah silkworm moths, with an average yield of 260 cocoons per moth, creating the highest national record for tussah silkworm cocoons.

Note: The total output of the seven crops in 1958 is calculated based on the estimated increase in production.

    让人们生活得更美好
    烟麻糖丝茶齐增产
    据新华社29日讯  目前全国各地的经济作物普遍呈现一片大丰收的景象，有的已经开始大量收获。据初步测产预计，今年有不少经济作物将由过去完成国家计划较差变为增产百分之几十、一倍到几倍。其中烤烟总产量将比去年增产二倍多，苎麻总产量将比去年增产80％，黄麻、洋麻总产量将比去年增产30％以上，甘蔗总产量将比去年增产一倍，甜菜总产量将比去年增产三、四倍，蚕茧总产量将比去年增产50％，茶叶总产量将比去年增产30％以上，主要水果总产量也将大大超过去年水平。
    今年烤烟生产由于实行深翻烟田，提早栽种，充分供给肥料水分，不断地和自然灾害作斗争，烟株生长特别旺盛。我国最大的烤烟产区河南省今年烤烟总产量预计比去年增产五、六倍，山东、安徽、贵州、云南等省烤烟，预计比去年增产二、三倍。从各地糖料作物生产情况预测，福建全省甘蔗平均亩产一万斤大有希望，这个省的仙游县十万亩甘蔗预计亩产可达四万斤。广东省甘蔗总产量预计比去年翻一番。湖北省三十多万亩苎麻头季麻的产量接近去年三季产量三十四万担的总和，这个省的阳新县大同一社一亩三分八厘苎麻，创造了两季亩产二千零二十斤的纪录。浙江、福建、广东、湖南、贵州、江苏等省茶叶总产量预计均比去年增产36％以上。不少茶园放射了高产“卫星”。福建省崇安县高峰农业社一亩一分四厘茶园，平均亩产水仙茶一千六百三十五点九斤。今年各地由于普遍加强桑园管理，桑叶产量提高，给蚕茧增产创造了有利条件。全国主要桑蚕产区浙江、四川、广东等省蚕茧产量预计比去年增产20％以上，山西、安徽、湖北等省预计比去年增产80％以上，河南、湖南、贵州、广西等省（区）预计比去年有的增产一倍，有的增加几倍。湖北省南漳县金箱二社饲养三张春蚕种平均每张产茧一百九十二点八斤。甘肃省徽成县张家庄农业社每张秋蚕种产茧一百八十九点三斤，贵州省正安县中心社饲养柞蚕三百七十蛾，平均每蛾产茧二百六十粒，创造了全国柞蚕茧的最高纪录。烤烟、苎麻等七种作物去年的总产量注：1958年总产量是根据预计增产数算出来的。
