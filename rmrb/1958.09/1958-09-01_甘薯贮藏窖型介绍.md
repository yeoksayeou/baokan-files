Introduction to Sweet Potato Storage Cellar Types
　　Jin Zuxun

China has cultivated sweet potatoes for hundreds of years, and the working people have rich experience in doing a good job in sweet potato storage. In areas with different climates, soil qualities, and water levels, they have created many well-performing storage cellar types suitable for their respective regions. They are now introduced below for reference by various localities:

I. Well Cellar Category

This can be used in areas with firm soil, low groundwater levels, and high terrain. The advantages of this type of cellar are simple management methods, easier late-stage insulation, low construction costs, long service life, and small land occupation. The disadvantages are that it is inconvenient to enter and exit the cellar, and it is difficult to lower the temperature of the sweet potato pile in the early stage in areas with large storage volumes or high temperatures.

The well shaft of this type of cellar should not be too deep or too shallow, and should vary according to local conditions. In high-temperature areas, it can be shallower, and vice versa. The size of the well opening also varies depending on the temperature and the depth of the well shaft. If the temperature is low and the well shaft is shallow, the opening should be small, and vice versa.

The following are introductions to several cellar types in this category:

(1) Well Cellar: One of the cellar types commonly used in both southern and northern China. The digging method is very simple. First, dig a well shaft with a small diameter at the top and a large diameter at the bottom, generally about ten to twenty feet deep (in southern China, the depth of the well shaft may be only five or six feet; in northern China, it may be more than twenty feet), and then open a cellar room on each side of the base of the well shaft. The size of the cellar room varies depending on the amount of sweet potatoes to be stored; the cellar rooms in the north are larger, generally storing about 10,000 catties of sweet potatoes per cellar. Most of these cellars currently have no ventilation equipment, so special attention should be paid to cooling down in the early stage.

(2) Multi-Room Well Cellar: This type of cellar is unique to Jimo County, Shandong Province. When digging the cellar, first dig a well shaft, then dig three cellar rooms in three directions at the base of the well shaft, and then dig a small cellar room on each side wall of each cellar room. The entire cellar has a total of nine large and small cellar rooms, which can store up to 50,000 to 60,000 catties of sweet potatoes. Because this type of cellar has a large storage capacity and only one well shaft in the middle for ventilation, it is necessary to do a good job in cooling down the sweet potatoes in the early stage of entering the cellar.

(3) Improved Well Cellar: More commonly used in North China. The digging method is to first dig a well shaft with a top diameter of 2 to 2.5 feet, a bottom diameter of 3.5 feet, and a depth of 9 to 10 feet. At the base of the shaft, dig a horizontal passage 2.5 feet wide, 4.5 feet high, and generally 10 feet long. On both sides of the passage, 4 to 8 feet away from the passage entrance, dig doors 2 feet wide, 4.5 feet high, and 3 feet thick in a staggered manner. Inside the door, dig a cellar room 4.5 feet wide, 5 feet high, and 10 feet long. Its storage capacity is generally 8,000 to 10,000 catties.

(4) Double-Shaft Well Cellar: This is used in some areas of Hebei and Henan provinces. When digging the cellar, first dig two well shafts, and connect the bases of the two shafts with a passage. At the base of the shaft and on both sides of the passage, dig cellar rooms, generally six to ten, with a total storage capacity of 60,000 to 70,000 catties of sweet potatoes. Because the double-shaft well shaft has two well openings, air is easy to convect, which makes it easier to cool down when storing large quantities. In the later stage of storage, avoid opening both cellar openings at the same time to avoid frost damage.

(5) Cliff Well Cellar: The digging method of the cellar is similar to that of the improved well cellar, except that the horizontal passage is dug through to the outside of the cellar, creating two cellar openings on the top and side. Cellar rooms are dug on both sides of the passage, generally storing about 30,000 catties of sweet potatoes. This cellar has two cellar openings, which is not only convenient for entry and exit, but also conducive to the decline of high temperature in the early stage, but in severe cold, the side cellar opening must be filled with soil, otherwise it is easy to suffer from frost damage.

II. Shed Cellar Category

This type of cellar can also be divided into underground and above-ground types. Underground shed cellars can be used in areas with poor soil quality and high water levels, and above-ground cellars can be used in areas with excessively high water levels. It has the advantages of saving labor in digging cellars, simple management, and easier cooling of sweet potato piles in the early stage. However, it also has the disadvantages of unstable cellar temperature, poor insulation, and occupying more land area than well cellars.

In order to keep warm and prevent cold, the four corners of the cellar should be dug into a circular shape, and a layer of grass (the thickness varies depending on the location) should be wrapped around the upper edge of the cellar wall for one to two feet as a cold-proof layer. In this type of cellar, only the following are introduced:

(1) Shed Cellar: Called a square cellar in the south, it is commonly used in both northern and southern China. Generally, dig a pit about 10 feet long and 5 to 6 feet deep and wide. Erect wooden purlins on the pit opening, and cover with tall grain stalks and soil. Leave one cellar opening on the top. Because the amount of sweet potatoes stored is closely related to the cellar temperature and the temperature of the sweet potato pile, the cellar body is generally smaller in the south and larger in the north. Store sweet potatoes according to two-thirds of the cellar volume. In the north, each cellar generally stores about 10,000 catties.

(2) Above-Ground Cellar: First build a soil wall 9 feet long, 5 to 6 feet wide and high on the ground. The wall is 1.5 feet thick. Use sorghum stalks to make a fence on the inside, and fill the space between the wall and the fence with wheat bran and hulls. Store sweet potatoes in the cellar, leaving an aisle in the middle. Leave several air holes on the soil wall of the cellar, and leave a cellar door on the south side. Special attention should be paid to insulation in the later stage of storage in this type of cellar.

III. Kiln Cellar Category

This type of cellar is suitable for hills or mountainous areas with firm and dry soil. Its advantages are simple management methods, low cost, and convenient entry and exit. Its disadvantages are that the cellar site selection is strict, and the insulation is worse than that of well cellars.

The digging method of this type of cellar is very simple. Dig a horizontal cave in the cliff, with the cave entrance being slightly smaller. If you want to increase the storage capacity of sweet potatoes, you can dig several small cellar rooms inside the cave, but you must strictly prevent collapse. (See the figure on the right)

IV. Buried Cellar Category

This type of cellar is suitable for areas with high water levels, low temperatures, poor soil quality, or lack of wood. It has the advantages of low cost and simple management methods, but also has the disadvantage of not being able to go down to the cellar for inspection at any time. The digging method of the buried cellar is roughly the same as that of the shed cellar, only shallower. After the sweet potatoes are put in, do not build a shed, and directly cover with grass and soil. In order to prevent the temperature inside the sweet potato pile from being too high, sorghum stalks can be erected in the pile for ventilation.

V. Pile Storage Cellar Category

This type of cellar is used in areas with excessively high water levels, loose soil, and high temperatures. Although the management method of this cellar is simple, the storage capacity is generally not large, and the amount of covering material is too much in areas where the temperature is not very high.

Taking the ordinary pile storage cellar as an example, the digging method is to first dig a shallow pot-shaped circular pit on the ground, pile up sweet potato pieces on the pit, erect a ventilation hole (made of bamboo) in the pile, and cover the pile with grass and soil.

In the management process of this type of cellar, attention should be paid to increasing or decreasing the covering material according to the temperature rise and fall.

Finally, it should also be pointed out that using a good cellar type is only one of the necessary conditions for achieving safe storage of sweet potatoes. In addition, attention must also be paid to disease-free and uninjured sweet potato pieces and a series of management work.

　　甘薯贮藏窖型介绍
　　靳祖训
    我国培植甘薯已有几百年历史，劳动人民对做好甘薯贮藏工作具有丰富的经验。在气候、土质、水位不同的地区，创造了很多性能良好适合本地区的贮藏窖型。现介绍于下，供各地参考：
    一、井窖类
    在土质坚实、地下水位低、地势较高地区可以采用。这类窖的优点是管理方法简易，后期保温较易，建筑成本低，使用年限久，占用土地面积小。缺点是出入窖不便，在贮藏量过大或气温较高地区，初期薯堆温度降低较难。
    这类窖的井筒不宜过深、过浅，应因地而异。气温高的地区可以浅些，反之宜深。井口大小亦因气温和井筒深度而异。气温低、井筒浅者，口宜小，反之应加大。
    兹将该类的几种窖型分别介绍于下：
    （一）井窖　为我国南、北方普遍应用的窖型之一，它的挖法很简单，先挖口径小、底径大的一般深约十至二十尺的井筒（井筒深度在我国南方有仅五、六尺的；北方有深二十尺以上的），再从井筒基部两侧各开一窖室。窖室大小因贮薯量而异；北方窖室较大，一般每窖贮薯一万斤左右。这种窖目前多无通气设备，所以应特别注意初期降温工作。
    （二）多室井窖　这种窖是山东省即墨县所独有。挖窖时先挖一井筒，在井筒基部向三个方向挖三个窖室，再在各窖室的两侧壁上各挖一小窖室，全窖计有大小九个窖室，贮薯可达五、六万斤。此种窖，因贮薯量很大，而仅有中间一个井筒通气，所以必须做好甘薯入窖初期的降温工作。
    （三）改良井窖　华北地区使用较多，挖法是先挖上口直径二至二点五尺、底径三点五尺、深九至十尺的井筒。在筒的基部，挖一宽二点五尺、高四点五尺，一般长十尺的水平通道。在通道两侧距通道口四到八尺处，交错挖宽二尺、高四点五尺、厚三尺的门。门里挖宽四点五尺、高五尺、长十尺的窖室。其贮藏量一般为八千至万斤。
    （四）双筒井窖这是河北、河南省的部分地区所采用的。挖窖时先挖两个井筒，两筒基部用通道相连，在筒的基部及通道两侧挖窖室一般六至十个，计贮薯六至七万斤。双筒井筒因有两个井口，空气易于对流，在大量贮藏时降温较易。在贮薯后期切忌同时开两窖口，以免发生冷害。
    （五）崖井窖　窖的挖法与改良井窖相似，仅将水平通道挖通，直达窖外，造成上边、侧边两个窖口，通道两侧挖窖室，一般可贮薯三万斤左右。该窖有两窖口，不但出入方便，而且也利于初期高温的下降，但严寒时必须将侧窖口用土打实，否则易遭冷害。
    二、棚窖类
    这类窖也可分地下式与地上式两种。在土质较坏、水位较高地区可采用地下式棚窖，水位过高地区可采用地上式窖。它具有挖窖省工、管理简易、初期薯堆降温较易等优点。但也具有窖温不稳定，保温较差，占用土地面积较井窖多的缺点。
    为了保温、防寒，窖的四角要挖成圆形，窖壁四周上缘一至二尺处应围起一层草（厚度因地而异）做为防寒层。在该类窖中兹仅介绍：
    （一）棚窖　南方称为方窖，我国北方南方普遍应用。一般挖长十尺左右，深、宽五至六尺的土坑，坑口架木檩，复高粮秸、土等，顶上留窖口一个。因为贮薯量的多少与窖温及薯堆温度都有密切关系，所以南方窖身一般较小，北方较大，盛薯按窖容积的三分之二计，北方一般每窖贮万斤左右。
    （二）地上窖　先在地上筑纵长九尺，宽、高各五至六尺的土墙，墙厚一点五尺，内侧用高粱秸作成一道篱笆，墙与篱笆间填充麦糠，皮壳。窖内存甘薯，中间留一走道，窖的土墙上留数个气孔，南面留一窖门。这种窖在贮藏后期应特别注意保温工作。
    三、窑窖类
    这类窖适用于土质坚实、干燥的丘陵或山区。它的优点是管理方法简易，成本低廉，出入方便。它的缺点是窖址选择严格，保温较井窖差。
    这类窖挖法很简单，在崖上挖一横洞，洞口略小即可。如欲增加贮薯量，可将洞内再挖几个小窖室，但须严防倒塌。　（如右图）
    四、埋藏窖类
    该类窖适用于水位较高，气温较低土质较坏或木料缺乏的地区。它有成本低，管理方法简易的优点，但也有不能随时下窖检查的缺点。埋藏窖的挖法与棚窖大体相同，仅较浅些。入薯后不搭棚，直接复草，复土。为了防止薯堆内温度过高，堆内可竖高粱秸束备通风之用。
    五、堆藏窖类
    这类窖在水位过高，土质松软，气温较高地区使用。这种窖虽管理方法简单，但贮藏量一般不大，复盖物在气温不甚高的地区用量太多。
    现以普通堆藏窖为例，它的挖法是在地面上先挖一浅锅形圆坑，坑上堆起薯块，堆中竖一通气孔（毛竹制的），堆外复草、复土。
    这种窖在管理过程中应注意随气温升降，增减复盖物。
    最后还应指出，使用良好窖型仅是做到甘薯安全贮藏的必要条件之一。此外还必须注意无病、无伤的薯块和一系列管理工作。
