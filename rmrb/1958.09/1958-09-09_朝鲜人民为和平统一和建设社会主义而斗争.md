The Korean People Fight for Peaceful Reunification and Socialist Construction
Li Zhouyuan, Deputy Prime Minister of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

The glorious motherland of the Korean people, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is ten years old.

In our country with a long history, ten years is a very short time, but the achievements made by the Korean people in these ten years are greater than the achievements made in the past thousands of years.

The establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a great victory and an epoch-making advance in the struggle of the Korean people for the development of our country's revolution and the construction of a free and independent country.

Since the establishment of their own regime, the Korean people have had their own central government and have become an equal member of the ranks of democratic countries in the world.

The government of the Republic is a true people's regime composed of people from all walks of life, with workers and peasants as its backbone. This revolutionary regime inherits the glorious tradition of the Korean people's revolutionary struggle led by steadfast communists headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung. This regime is a powerful weapon of our revolution under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist new type of party – the Korean Workers' Party.

The ten years that the government of the Republic has gone through have been full of complex and tense events. This period includes three stages: the pre-war peaceful construction period, the Fatherland Liberation War period, and the post-war recovery and construction period.

During the pre-war peaceful construction period, the government of the Republic achieved remarkable results in the struggle for the restoration and development of the people's economy and the improvement of the people's livelihood. However, our people's peaceful labor was interrupted by the war provoked by the US imperialist aggressors and its running dogs, the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique.

The war brought incalculable disasters and immense suffering to our people. However, the brutal and barbaric acts of the US imperialist aggressors did not subdue the Korean people. With the active support and solidarity of the people of fraternal countries headed by the great Soviet Union and China, and peace-loving people all over the world, the Korean people achieved a brilliant victory in the Fatherland Liberation War which lasted more than three years.

The Korean War proved that the people who have been liberated from foreign colonial rule, who have seized power in their own hands, and who firmly rely on the great socialist camp, are invincible. The war clearly demonstrated the invincible power and infinite vitality of the people's democratic system established in the northern half of the Republic.

The war of more than three years caused serious damage to our people's economy and people's lives. The Korean people needed to rebuild everything on the ruins.

Under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, and inspired by the continuous assistance from the people of fraternal socialist countries, our people displayed collective heroism in the struggle for the post-war recovery and construction of the people's economy.

During the post-war Three-Year Plan period, our industrial and agricultural production recovered and exceeded pre-war levels. Industrial production roughly doubled that of pre-war levels, and grain production increased by 108% of pre-war levels. The colonial deformity of industry was significantly eliminated, and the technical foundation of industry was further strengthened. The cooperative movement of the rural economy achieved great success, and the socialist economic form occupied an absolute leading position in urban and rural areas. Thanks to the successful completion of the Three-Year Plan, we not only restored the damaged people's economy, but also basically laid the foundation for the self-reliance of the national economy, fundamentally changing the country's socio-economic foundation. Due to the successful completion of the Three-Year Plan, our people's economy basically ended the tasks of the recovery period and entered a new period, that is, the period of socialist construction.

The first Five-Year (1957-1961) Plan for the development of the people's economy, which was implemented for the first time in our country, showed the brilliant prospects of our country.

The basic task of the first Five-Year Plan is to further strengthen the socialist economic base in the northern half of the Republic and basically solve the people's problems of clothing, food, and housing.

The Five-Year Plan was resolutely formulated based on the basic line of our Party's economic policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry while developing light industry and agriculture at the same time. This policy has been fully proven to be correct in the practical life of the post-war period. The theoretical basis of this policy is the Marxist-Leninist theory of reproduction on the priority development of the production of means of production. This policy is a creative policy based on a scientific assessment of the specific practical conditions of our country. During the Five-Year Plan period, the total industrial output value of our country will increase by more than 2.6 times, of which the production of means of production will increase by 2.9 times, and the production of consumer goods will increase by 2.2 times.

During this period, special emphasis should be placed on the development of industries such as building materials, ferrous metals, machine manufacturing, and chemicals, and light industries such as textiles, food processing, and daily necessities production will also be rapidly developed. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the textile industry will produce more than 20 meters of textiles per capita per year.

With the strong assistance of heavy industry, the rural economy will also complete socialist cooperativization during the plan period and continue to strengthen its material and technical base. Total grain production will increase by 1.3 times, meat production will increase by 6.7 times, and fruit production will increase by about 8 times.

During this period, with the rapid development of the people's economy, the actual income of all workers will increase by an average of more than 1.5 times, and more than 300,000 modern cultural houses will be built in cities, and more than 200,000 modern cultural houses will be built in rural areas. During this period, the compulsory secondary education system will be fully implemented for the first time in our country's history, and the entire sector of the cultural revolution will be further upsurged. After we complete the first Five-Year Plan in the future, we will transform our country into a developed industrial and agricultural country with an independent industrial base. The sole leadership of the socialist economic form will be established in all sectors of the people's economy. To greet the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic, all the working people of our country have enthusiastically launched a labor competition in order to complete and over fulfill the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. They have already completed 117% of the total industrial output value plan in the first year of the first Five-Year Plan – 1957, which is equivalent to 144% of 1956; and completed 110.3% of the grain production plan in 1957.

In the first half of 1958, 110% of the total industrial output value plan was completed, which is equivalent to 134% of the same period last year. As of the end of March this year, 98.6% of all farmers have participated in agricultural cooperatives. The rural areas of our country have completely become a purely socialist economy. A new upsurge has begun in the entire agricultural production sector.

We have already been able to use our own strength to well design and build large-scale modern factory facilities, for which we have strong industrial and technical forces. Cultural houses are being vigorously built in cities and rural areas. Taking Pyongyang as an example, 20,000 modern multi-story houses will be built this year.

The labor enthusiasm of our country's workers, who are convinced of the correctness of the Party's policies and inspired by the brilliant prospects, is unprecedented. To cite a recent example, young railway builders victoriously completed the laying of the broad-gauge railway from Haeju to Hasaeng-ri, which is more than 80 kilometers long, in only 75 days. We call this revolutionary upsurge "Chollima."

With the victorious advance of socialist construction, the national social system has been further consolidated, and the leading role of the working class has been further enhanced. The political and moral unity of the people with the worker-peasant alliance as the core and the Fatherland Unification Front with the Korean Workers' Party as the core have been further strengthened on a new economic basis.

Democracy has been unprecedentedly promoted among the people. The flesh-and-blood relationship between the people's regime and the people has been further consolidated, and the dictatorial function of the people's regime has also been further strengthened and tempered.

All the victories and achievements achieved by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a country of working people led by the working class, are the glorious victories of Marxism-Leninism in our country.

The victories and achievements achieved by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fully demonstrate the correctness of the policies firmly implemented by our Party based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism on socialist revolution and socialist construction. This principle was reaffirmed by the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries.

In the future, the Korean people will adhere to this revolutionary principle that has been tested and proven in life, wage an irreconcilable struggle against all manifestations of modern revisionism, and defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism to the end.

From the first day of its establishment, our Republic has stood firmly on the Eastern outpost as a member of the socialist family and has received strong support and assistance from fraternal friends headed by the great Soviet Union.

In particular, the people of our great neighbor, China, have always sincerely supported and aided our people's Fatherland Liberation War. During the most difficult period of the war, under the sacred slogan of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea, Protecting the Home and Defending the Country," they directly sent the Chinese People's Volunteers composed of their outstanding sons and daughters to aid our people with blood. Not only that, but in the post-war period, in addition to giving all the materials and expenses sent to our country from the early stages of the war to the end of 1953 as free aid, the government of the People's Republic of China also gave our country huge aid of 800 million yuan free of charge during the four years after the war.

This aid is a great inspiration to the people of our country who are rebuilding everything on the ruins, and it has become an important food source for restoring and developing the people's economy.

The Korean people believe that the strengthening of fraternal mutual assistance, cooperation, friendly unity between our country and socialist countries based on proletarian internationalism is an important guarantee for all our victories. Our people have experienced the power of proletarian internationalism through practical life, and in the future, they will continue to resolutely maintain the fraternal friendship and unity of socialist countries centered on the great Soviet Union like protecting their eyeballs.

The Korean people have not yet realized the peaceful reunification and independence of their country. The peaceful reunification of the country is the greatest national task of the Korean people.

The Korean issue must be resolved peacefully by the Korean people themselves on a democratic basis without any foreign interference. Therefore, the prerequisite for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

The Chinese People's Volunteers first withdrew from Korea in accordance with the proactive measures of the DPRK-China governments, making a great contribution to the peaceful reunification of Korea and the maintenance of peace in the Far East. However, the US imperialist aggressor troops occupying South Korea are not only not withdrawing from South Korea, but are also attempting to permanently remain in South Korea. They are turning South Korea into a base for atomic war and are frantically attempting to provoke a new war.

The 13-year rule of the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang has caused tremendous sacrifices and immense disasters to our South Korean compatriots. National industries have been completely bankrupt and declined; the rural areas of South Korea, known as the granary area, have become chronic famine areas; more than 3.8 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people and more than 3 million farmers who have run out of food are wandering everywhere in search of jobs; various cities and villages are dilapidated; US imperialist robbers are manufacturing heinous atrocities that arouse public outrage everywhere; the people have no democratic rights and are in a dark situation in the Middle Ages. This is the situation in South Korea under the rule of US imperialism and Syngman Rhee today. The following statistics comparing the per capita output of major industrial products and grains between North and South Korea clearly illustrate the reality of the prosperous North and the bankrupt and declining South.

The artificial division of the motherland has caused all kinds of pain and misfortune to the Korean people. The root cause of all evils lies in the fact that the US imperialists are occupying South Korea. From the first day of its establishment, the government of the Republic has consistently made a series of sincere efforts to realize the peaceful reunification and independence of the country. At the same time, out of compatriotic love, it has always extended a helping hand to the South Korean people who are groaning under the reactionary rule of the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. On the occasion of greeting the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic, the government of the Republic recently passed Cabinet Decision No. 96 on providing relief to the unemployed and homeless orphans in the southern half of the country who are groaning under the US imperialist occupation. In this decision, the government of the Republic proposed to provide 150,000 seok of rice, 5 million meters of textiles, 10,000 tons of aquatic products, and 4 million pairs of shoes, worth 16 billion South Korean hwan, free of charge to relieve the unemployed and homeless orphans in the southern half of the country, and to accept all orphans who are wandering on the streets of the southern half of the country, and to provide 1,000 won per month per person to 3,000 college students in the southern half of the country for a long time. Today, the dire situation of the South Korean people requires the immediate implementation of this decision. The Syngman Rhee authorities must immediately assist so that these gifts - the assistance made by the people of the northern half of the Republic out of noble compatriotic love - can reach the people of the southern half as soon as possible.

At the same time, the US imperialist aggressor troops must withdraw from South Korea immediately. There is no excuse for the continued presence of the unwelcome guests - the US imperialist aggressor troops - in South Korea. The Korean people will surely force the US imperialist aggressor troops to get out of South Korea and peacefully reunify the country by themselves without foreign interference.

Today, all the people in the northern half of the country are watching the brilliant victories and achievements they have made in the ten years since the founding of the Republic with incomparable pride and self-esteem. The great achievements made by our people well prove that the people who have been freed from colonial enslavement and the exploitation and oppression of landlords and capitalists and have become masters of the country can exert unimaginable great power and can manage their own country. However, the Korean people will never be satisfied with the victories they have achieved. Our people are highly vigilant against the plots of the dying enemies in the southern half of the country to launch a new war, and are full of firm determination and confidence to strive for greater victories in the future.

The people of the powerful socialist countries centered on the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world are supporting and aiding our Korean people. No force can or will be able to stop our Korean people from advancing victoriously.

　　朝鲜人民为和平统一和建设社会主义而斗争
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相　李周渊
    朝鲜人民光荣的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国成立已经十年了。
    在有悠久历史的我国，十年是极短的时间，但是朝鲜人民在这十年当中所取得的成就，比过去几千年所取得的成就还要大。
    在朝鲜人民为我国革命的发展和建设自由、独立国家的斗争中，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的成立，是一个伟大的胜利、划时代的前进。
    朝鲜人民自建立自己的政权以来，就有了自己的中央政府，成了世界民主国家队伍中的同等的一员。
    共和国政府是以工人、农民为骨干，由各阶层人民组成的真正的人民政权，这个革命政权继承了以金日成同志为首的坚贞的共产主义者所领导的朝鲜人民革命斗争的光荣传统。这个政权是在马克思列宁主义的新型政党——朝鲜劳动党领导下的我们革命的强有力的武器。
    共和国政府所走过的十年，充满了复杂和紧张的事件。这段时间包括三个时期：战前和平建设时期，祖国解放战争时期，战后恢复建设时期。
    战前和平建设时期，共和国政府在为人民经济的恢复发展和改善人民生活的斗争中，取得了显著的成果。但是由于美帝国主义侵略者和它的走狗李承晚卖国匪帮所挑起的战争，我们人民的和平劳动被中断了。
    战争给我国人民带来了不可估量的灾难和莫大的痛苦。但是残暴的美帝国主义侵略者的兽性蛮行并没能使朝鲜人民屈服。受到以伟大苏联、中国为首的兄弟国家人民和全世界爱好和平人民积极支持和声援的朝鲜人民，在三年多的祖国解放战争中取得了光辉的胜利。
    朝鲜战争证实，从外国殖民地统治下获得解放的人民、自己手中掌握了政权并坚强依靠伟大的社会主义阵营的人民，是不可征服的。战争清楚地显示了在共和国北半部建立的人民民主制度不可战胜的威力和无穷的生命力。
    三年多的战争，使我国的人民经济和人民生活遭到了严重的破坏。朝鲜人民需要在废墟上重新建设一切。
    我国人民在朝鲜劳动党的正确领导下，为兄弟的社会主义阵营各国人民源源不断的援助所鼓舞，在战后人民经济恢复建设的斗争中，发挥了集体英雄主义。
    战后三年计划期间，我国工业和农业生产恢复并超过了战前水平，工业生产大约增为战前的二倍，谷物生产增为战前的108％，显著地清除了工业的殖民地畸形性，并进一步加强了工业的技术基础。农村经济的合作化运动取得了巨大成就，社会主义经济形态在城市和农村占绝对领导地位。由于胜利完成了三年计划，我们不仅恢复了被破坏了的人民经济，而且基本上奠定了民族经济的自立基础，从根本上改变了国家的社会经济基础。由于三年计划的胜利完成，我国的人民经济基本上结束了恢复时期的任务，踏入了新的时期，那就是建设社会主义的时期。
    在我国首次执行的第一个五年（1957—1961）人民经济发展计划，展示了我国的辉煌前景。
    第一个五年计划的基本任务，是在共和国北半部进一步加强社会主义经济基础，基本上解决人民的衣食住问题。
    五年计划是坚决地根据我党优先发展重工业并同时发展轻工业和农业的经济政策的基本路线制订的。这一政策在战后时期通过实际生活完全证明了它的正确性。这个政策的理论基础是马克思列宁主义关于优先发展生产资料生产的再生产理论。这一政策是科学地估计了我国具体实际情况的创造性政策。五年计划期间，我国的工业总产值将增为二点六倍以上，其中生产资料的生产将增为二点九倍，消费品的生产将增为二点二倍。
    在这期间，特别要以建筑材料、黑色金属、机器制造、化学等工业部门的发展为重点，纺织、食品加工、日用品生产等轻工业也将迅速地得到发展。到五年计划末期，纺织工业一年将生产按人口平均计算二十公尺以上的纺织品。
    在重工业的强有力的帮助下，农村经济也将在计划期间完成社会主义合作化，并继续加强它的物质及技术基础。谷物总产量将增为一点三倍，肉类生产将增为六点七倍，水果生产大约将增为八倍。
    在这期间，随着人民经济的迅速发展，全体劳动者的实际收入平均将增为一点五倍以上，在城市将建设三十万户以上现代文化住宅，在农村将建设二十万户以上现代文化住宅。这期间，将在我国历史上首次全面实行中等义务教育制，文化革命的整个部门将进一步高涨。我们今后完成了第一个五年计划，将使我国变成为有自主工业基础的发达的工农业国。在人民经济的所有部门，将确立社会主义经济形态的唯一领导。迎接共和国成立十周年，我国全体劳动人民，为了提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划，热烈开展了劳动竞赛。他们已经在第一个五年计划的第一年——1957年完成了工业总产值计划的117％，这相当于1956年的144％；1957年完成谷物生产计划110.3％。
    在1958年上半年完成了工业总产值计划110％，这相当于去年同期的134％。截至今年3月底，全体农户的98.6％参加了农业社。我国的农村完全变成清一色的社会主义经济了。在整个农业生产部门开始出现了新的高潮。
    我们已经能够用自己的力量很好地设计和建设大规模的现代工厂设施，为此我们已有了强有力的工业及技术力量。在城市和农村正大力建设文化住宅，以平壤市为例，今年将建筑两万户现代多层住宅。
    确信党的政策的正确性、为辉煌的前景所鼓舞的我国劳动者的劳动热潮是空前的。举最近的一个例子，年青的铁路建设者们仅用了七十五天就胜利地完成了长达八十多公里的海州——下圣间宽轨敷设工程。我们把这种革命高潮称为“千里马”。
    随着社会主义建设的胜利前进，国家社会制度进一步得到了巩固，工人阶级的领导作用，更加提高了。以工农联盟为核心的人民群众在政治和道义上的统一和以朝鲜劳动党为核心的祖国统一战线在新的经济基础上进一步得到了加强。
    民主在人民群众中空前地得到了发扬。人民政权和人民群众的血肉关系进一步得到了巩固，人民政权的专政机能也进一步得到了加强，得到了锻炼。
    工人阶级领导的劳动人民的国家——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国取得的一切胜利和成就，都是马克思列宁主义在我国的光辉胜利。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国取得的胜利和成就，充分证明了我党坚定执行的基于马克思列宁主义关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的原则的政策的正确。这个原则曾由社会主义各国共产党和工人党莫斯科宣言再次阐明。
    朝鲜人民今后也将坚持这个在生活中经受过考验和证明的革命原则，同现代修正主义的一切表现进行不调和的斗争，把马克思列宁主义的纯洁性捍卫到底。
    我们的共和国从成立的头一天起就作为社会主义大家庭的一个成员，坚定地站在东方前哨，并受到了以伟大的苏联为首的兄弟般的朋友有力的支持和援助。
    特别是我们的伟大邻邦中国的人民，始终诚心诚意支持和声援我们人民的祖国解放战争，在战争最艰苦的时期，在“抗美援朝保家卫国”的神圣口号下，直接派遣了以自己优秀儿女组成的中国人民志愿军，用鲜血援助了我们人民。不仅如此，在战后时期，中华人民共和国政府除了把战争初期到1953年底这一期间送给我国的一切物资和费用作为无偿援助外，还在战后四年期间无偿地给予我国八亿元的巨大援助。
    这一援助，对在废墟上重建一切的我国人民是莫大的鼓舞力量，并成为恢复和发展人民经济的重要食粮。
    朝鲜人民认为，我国和社会主义阵营各国基于无产阶级国际主义的兄弟般的互助合作和友好团结的加强，是自己一切胜利的重要保证。我们人民通过实际生活体验到了无产阶级国际主义的威力，今后仍将像保护眼珠一样坚决维护以伟大苏联为中心的社会主义阵营各国的兄弟般的友谊和团结。
    朝鲜人民还没有实现祖国的和平统一和独立。祖国的和平统一，这是朝鲜人民的最大的民族任务。
    朝鲜问题必须在没有任何外国干涉的条件下，由朝鲜人民自己在民主基础上和平解决。因此，和平解决朝鲜问题的前提条件，就是一切外国军队撤出朝鲜。
    中国人民志愿军根据朝中两国政府的主动措施首先撤出朝鲜，对和平统一朝鲜和维护远东和平作出了巨大的贡献。但是，强占着南朝鲜的美帝国主义侵略军，不仅不撤出南朝鲜，反而企图永久留驻南朝鲜。它们正在使南朝鲜变成原子战争基地，疯狂地企图挑起新战争。
    美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮历时十三年的统治，使得南朝鲜同胞遭受了巨大的牺牲和莫大的灾难。民族工业全面破产和衰落；号称谷仓地区的南朝鲜农村变成了慢性的饥馑地区；三百八十万以上的失业者和半失业者以及三百万以上的绝粮农民为求职谋生到处流浪；各个城市和乡村荒废不堪；美帝国主义强盗到处制造激起公愤的兽性暴行；人民没有一点民主权利，处于中世纪时期的黑暗境地，这就是今天在美帝国主义和李承晚统治下的南朝鲜的情况。把南北朝鲜重要工业产品和谷物按人口平均计算的产量对比起来的下列统计，就清楚地说明隆盛繁荣的北半部和破产没落的南半部的实况。

    祖国被人为地分裂，朝鲜人民因此遭受到种种痛苦和不幸。一切祸根就在于美帝国主义者强占南朝鲜。共和国政府从成立的头一天起，始终一贯地为实现祖国的和平统一和独立作出了一系列有诚意的努力，同时从同胞爱出发，一直向呻吟在美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮反动统治下的南朝鲜人民伸出了救援之手。在迎接共和国成立十周年的时候，共和国政府最近又通过了关于救济在美帝国主义强占下呻吟的南半部失业者和流浪孤儿的内阁第九十六号决定。共和国政府在这个决定中建议，为救济南半部失业者和流浪孤儿，无偿提供十五万石大米、五百万公尺纺织品、一万吨水产品和四百万双鞋子等价值南朝鲜币一百六十亿圜的物资，并接受抚育在南半部街头流浪的全部孤儿，同时长期向南半部三千名大学生每月每人提供一千元助学金。今天，南朝鲜人民水深火热的处境，要求毫无迟延地实现这个决定。李承晚当局必须立即协助，使这些礼物——共和国北半部人民从崇高的同胞爱出发而作的援助早日到达南半部人民手中。
    同时，美帝国主义侵略军必须立即从南朝鲜撤出。不速之客——美帝国主义侵略军继续留驻南朝鲜的任何借口都是不存在的。朝鲜人民必定使美帝国主义侵略军滚出南朝鲜，在没有外国干涉的条件下由自己来和平统一祖国。
    今天，北半部全体人民怀着无比的骄傲和自豪，看到自己在共和国成立后十年间所取得的光辉的胜利和成就。我们人民取得的巨大的成就很好地证明，摆脱了殖民地奴役、地主和资本家的剥削和压迫成为国家主人的人民，能够发挥不可想像的伟大力量，能够管理自己的国家。但是朝鲜人民决不满足于已取得的胜利。我们人民对祖国南半部垂死挣扎的万恶的敌人发动新战争的阴谋保持着高度的警惕，并充满坚定的决心和信心，在今后争取更大胜利。
    以苏联为中心的强大的社会主义阵营各国人民和世界爱好和平人民都在支持和声援我们朝鲜人民，没有任何力量也不可能有任何力量阻挡我们朝鲜人民胜利前进。
