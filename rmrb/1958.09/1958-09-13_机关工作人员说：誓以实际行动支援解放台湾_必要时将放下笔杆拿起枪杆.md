    Staff of Government Agencies Say:
    Vow to Support the Liberation of Taiwan with Practical Actions
    Ready to Lay Down Our Pens and Take Up Guns When Necessary
    We resolutely support Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area and express our utmost anger and serious protest against the U.S. imperialists' blatant military threats and war provocations in the Taiwan Strait area of our country.

    Taiwan has been an inseparable part of our sacred territory since ancient times. Currently, under the dark rule of Chiang Kai-shek, our compatriots in Taiwan are still in dire straits. As long as Taiwan is not liberated, our cause of liberation will not be complete, and our country's security will be directly threatened. The U.S. imperialists' use of force to occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands is an act of interfering in our internal affairs and aggression against our country, which is absolutely intolerable. U.S. imperialism must get out of our territory of Taiwan!

    We are the staff of the Foreign Languages Press and vow to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions. We express our determination to the Party and the motherland that when the motherland needs us, we will resolutely respond to the call and take up arms to eliminate the invaders.
            Chen Youli and 20 others

    We fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement, resolutely respond to the solemn call of the Supreme State Conference, and unite to fight against the U.S. imperialists' military provocations and threats of war in the Taiwan Strait area!

    Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have always been Chinese territory, and Kinmen and Matsu are islands located in China's inland sea. Liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu is the sacred right of the Chinese people and brooks no foreign interference! The U.S. claim that "China has the ambition to seize new territory" is the most shameless lie in the world, which precisely exposes it as a robber with an aggressive nature!

    We are Chinese, and the Chinese people cannot be bullied. We have full confidence and sufficient strength to give the invaders a devastating blow!

    We solemnly declare: We are ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland, undertake the sacred responsibility of liberating Taiwan, and vow to contribute everything we have to defend the security of the motherland and world peace!

    机关工作人员说：
    誓以实际行动支援解放台湾
    必要时将放下笔杆拿起枪杆
    我们坚决地拥护周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，对美帝国主义公然在我国台湾海峡地区进行军事威胁和战争挑衅，表示万分的愤怒和严重的抗议。
    台湾自古以来就是我国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，目前在蒋介石的黑暗统治下，台湾同胞还处在水深火热之中。台湾一天没有得到解放，我们的解放事业就没有完成，我国的安全就直接受到威胁。美帝国主义用武力侵占台湾和澎湖列岛，这是干涉我国内政，侵略我国的行为，是绝对不能容许的。美帝国主义必须从我国领土台湾滚出去！
    我们是外文出版社的工作人员，誓以实际行动支援祖国解放台湾的斗争。我们向党和祖国表示决心，当祖国需要的时候，我们就坚决响应号召，拿起武器消灭侵略者。
            陈有利等二十人
    我们完全拥护周恩来总理的声明，坚决响应最高国务会议的庄严号召，一致动员起来，为反对美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅和战争威胁而斗争！
    台湾和澎湖列岛从来就是中国的领土，金门、马祖是位在中国内海的岛屿。解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖是我国人民的神圣权利，不容许任何外国干涉！美国说什么“中国有夺取新的领土的野心”是天下最无耻的谰言，这恰恰暴露了它是个侵略成性的强盗！
    我们是中国人，中国人是不可欺侮的，我们有充分的信心和足够的力量给侵略者以毁灭的打击！
    我们郑重宣告：随时准备响应祖国的召唤，承担起解放台湾的神圣责任，誓为保卫祖国的安全和世界的和平贡献出我们的一切！
