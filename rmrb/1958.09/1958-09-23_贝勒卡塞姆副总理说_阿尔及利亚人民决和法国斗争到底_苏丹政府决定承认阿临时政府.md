Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: According to TASS, Paris: "L'Humanité Hebdo" published on the 21st a statement by Belkacem, Vice Premier and Minister of Defense of the Algerian Republic Provisional Government, in the "Es-Sabah" newspaper in Tunisia on the 20th.

He said: "The first step of the (Algerian Republic) government is to request France to start negotiations. If France remains stubborn, we will continue political and military struggle. We are not fighting for the sake of war, but for independence and peace, for the happiness and prosperity of the Algerian people."

Belkacem emphasized that the Algerian people "despise the referendum" and consider it an invalid "referendum." He said that the leadership of the Algerian National Liberation Front "has decided to open a second front in France to awaken the French public and make them seriously consider the tragedy of Algeria."

He emphasized that "our goal is to strike at the French economy, but not to strike at the French people, as our consistent actions in the past can prove."

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, September 22nd: Iraqi newspapers published articles or commentaries on the 21st celebrating the establishment of the Algerian Provisional Government. The daily "Al-Zaman" wrote: "The establishment of the Algerian government is a heavy blow to de Gaulle's constitution and the referendum being prepared." The newspaper added that now there is an organization representing the Algerian people internationally, and France can no longer use the excuse that Algeria has no representatives to reject the United Nations resolutions on Algeria.

The newspaper also said that the new government will also be recognized by Arab countries, socialist countries, and neutral countries.

"Al-Hurriyah" wrote in a commentary today: "The Iraqi government's recognition of the Algerian government is a great thing, which internationally shows that Algeria belongs to the Arab countries." The newspaper added that the Algerian people are constantly carrying out heroic struggles to drive the French imperialists out of their country.

    他说：“（阿尔及利亚共和国）政府的第一个步骤是要求法国开始谈判。如果法国还是顽固不化，我们就要继续进行政治斗争和军事斗争。我们不是为战争而战争，而是为了独立和和平，为了阿尔及利亚人民的幸福和繁荣。”
    贝勒卡塞姆强调指出，阿尔及利亚人民“藐视公民投票”，认为它这种“公民投票”是无效的。他说，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领导机关“决定在法国开辟第二战线，以唤醒法国公众，使他们认真考虑阿尔及利亚的悲剧”。

    这家报纸又说，新政府还将得到阿拉伯国家、社会主义国家以及中立国家的承认。
    “自由报”今天在评论中写道：“伊拉克政府承认阿尔及利亚政府是做了一件伟大的事，这在国际方面表示阿尔及利亚属于阿拉伯国家。”这家报纸又说，阿尔及利亚人民为了把法国帝国主义者赶出他们的国家，不断地进行英勇的斗争。伊拉克著名宗教界领袖哈利西教长21日晚举行集会庆祝阿尔及利亚临时政府的成立。
