Sending “Ambassadors” to Promote Each Other, Running Universities to Study High Yields
Laibin Upgrades 200,000 Mu of Seedlings

Guangxi Daily News: Recently, Laibin County's townships, communes, and teams have launched a high-yield competition, opened field high-yield universities, established mobile commando camps, and launched a mass seedling upgrading super movement. More than 520,000 mu of medium and late rice have been universally upgraded: Over 80,000 mu of the original 130,000 mu of third-class seedlings have been upgraded to second-class, over 75,000 mu of the 170,000 mu of second-class seedlings have been upgraded to first-class, and over 56,000 mu of the 210,000 mu of first-class seedlings have been upgraded to special-class. These special-class seedlings are tall and strong with dense branches and leaves, strong enough to hold a wooden board without it falling.

Currently, Laibin is seeing townships, communes, and teams launching chain competitions, and mutually sending "ambassadors" to each commune (team) for mutual learning and promotion. After the Qinyingshou Team and Wei Wencai Team of the Shetou Commune in Qidong Township launched a competition, they mutually sent their deputy team leaders as resident "ambassadors." The tasks of the "ambassadors" were to disseminate and exchange experiences, supervise the implementation of competition conditions, and participate in production to play an exemplary role. After the "ambassador" of the Qin Team arrived at the Wei Team, they generally inspected the team's seedlings and found that 12 mu had been over-irrigated, and the seedlings were submerged. They wrote a big-character poster and posted it at the field: "This patch of seedlings is a pity, the water soaks the roots unattended. Please read the competition contract, how can you compete for first place like this?" After the Wei Team saw the big-character poster, they opened ditches overnight to drain the water and applied additional fertilizer. The "ambassador" sent by the Wei Team to the Qin Team found that the Qin Team applied less fertilizer and made suggestions. The Qin Team also immediately launched a campaign to apply more fertilizer. At the same time, the "ambassadors" of both teams reported these situations to their respective teams, and both teams conducted comprehensive inspections and strengthened nursing measures. Now, the fertilizer applied in the fields of both teams is two inches thick. Laibin, Beiwu, Heli, Nansi, and other townships (towns) have universally adopted this approach, which has a great role in mutual promotion. After Laibin Town and the communes of Beiwu Township mutually sent "ambassadors," they quickly eliminated third-class seedlings.

Opening field high-yield universities and conducting meticulous scientific research is also a powerful measure for Laibin to improve the quality of field management. Qianjiang, Nansi, and other townships have universally opened this new type of university. These universities are generally set up with a main school in the township and branch schools in the communes (and some also set up branch schools in satellite plots). The township party secretary serves as the president, the township party committee members as vice presidents, and township party committee members, branch secretaries, and technicians give lectures. The schools are divided into fertilizer application, drainage and irrigation, pest control, and other departments as needed, and adopt the method of combining classes, research, and internships, which has a very good effect. The High-Yield University branch school of the Dali Commune in Qianjiang Township is located at the head of the Dali satellite plot. The school uses this plot as its research object. Discovering that the plot lacked sunlight, which affected the growth of the seedlings, the students, after research, first cleared the weeds from the field base, trimmed the leaves from the trees at the edge of the field, and then used bamboo poles to clear a path between the seedlings (this plot was highly densely planted), greatly improving the sunlight conditions. After discovering that the seedlings in this plot were too dense to apply dry fertilizer, the students used ponds to build large fertilizer seas at the edge of the field and implemented gravity irrigation, which also solved the fertilizer problem.

In order to strive for the overall upgrading of seedlings, Sishan, Beiwu, and other townships (towns) have established mobile camps to carry out guerrilla-style assaults, which have also overcome the shortcomings of fixed camps only operating at certain points. For example, the Hongguang Commune in Shipai Township selected 200 people to organize a mobile camp and divided them into seven strongholds according to the 475 mu of third-class seedlings identified, and planted white flags. The mobile camp set up camp in the Chaoshan area on the first day and attacked fiercely for one day, eliminating 90 mu of third-class seedlings. They transferred on the second and third days and eliminated 364 mu of third-class seedlings in four days.

### 派“大使”互相促进  办大学研究高产  来宾二十万亩禾苗升级

　　派“大使”互相促进  办大学研究高产
　　来宾二十万亩禾苗升级
    广西日报消息　来宾县各乡、各社、各队近来展开了高产大竞赛，开办了田间高产大学，建立巡回突击营，掀起了全民性的禾苗升级超级运动。五十二万多亩中、晚稻普遍大升级：原来的十三万亩三类禾已有八万多亩升为二类，十七万多亩二类禾有七万五千亩升为一类，二十一万多亩一类禾有五万六千多亩跃为特类。这些特类禾高大粗壮、枝叶稠密，放上木板都不会跌落。
    来宾目前是乡乡、社社、队队开展连环竞赛，并互派“大使”驻社（队），互相学习，互相促进。七洞乡社头社覃英寿队和韦文才队开展竞赛后，互派副队长为驻队“大使”，规定“大使”任务为传播交流经验、监督竞赛条件执行情况，参加生产发挥模范作用。覃队的“大使”到了韦队后，普遍检查该队禾苗，发现有十二亩灌水过深，禾苗被泡，写了大字报贴在田头：“这垌禾苗真可惜，水浸禾尾无人理，请把竞赛合同看，这样怎能争第一。”韦队看了大字报，连夜开沟排水追施肥料。韦队派驻覃队的“大使”发现覃队追肥少，提出意见，覃队也马上突击加施肥料。同时，两队“大使”把这些情况向本队汇报，两队都进行全面检查，加强护理措施。现在，两个队田里追肥都达到两寸厚。来宾、北五、和里、南泗等乡（镇）普遍采取这一做法，对互相推动作用很大。来宾镇和北五乡各社互派“大使”后，很快消灭了三类禾苗。
    开办田间高产大学，进行细致的科学的研究，也是来宾提高田间管理质量的有力措施之一。迁江、南泗等乡已普遍开办了这种新型的大学。这种大学，一般是乡建总校、社设分校（也有在卫星垌设分校的），由乡委书记任校长、乡委委员任副校长、乡委委员、支部书记、技术员授课；学校按需要分设施肥、排灌、除虫等系，采用边上课、边研究、边实习的办法，效果很好。迁江乡大黎社高产大学分校设在大黎卫星垌的田头，该校即以这垌田为研究对象，发现这垌田阳光不足，影响禾苗生长，学员们经过研究，首先将田基杂草铲光，把田边树叶撂光，又用竹竿在禾蔸间打通一次（这垌田是高度密植），大大改善了阳光照射条件。在发现该垌田禾苗长得太密不易追施干肥后，学员利用水塘在田边大搞肥海，实行自流灌溉，也解决了施肥问题。
    为了争取禾苗全面大升级、寺山、北五等乡（镇）建立了流动营盘，开展游击式的突击，还克服了固定扎营只在点上活动的缺点。如石牌乡红光社挑选二百个人组织流动营盘，按照评出的四百七十五亩三类禾分成七个据点，插上白旗。流动营盘第一天在朝山片扎营，猛攻一天，消灭三类禾九十亩，第二、第三天转移，四天内消灭三类禾三百六十四亩。
