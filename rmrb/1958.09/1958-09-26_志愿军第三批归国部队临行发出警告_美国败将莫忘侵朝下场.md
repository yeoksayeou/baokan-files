Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 25th: The first peace train carrying the vanguard of the third batch of returning Chinese People's Volunteers departed from a certain station in Korea at 2:55 PM today (Pyongyang time), triumphantly returning home along the road of victory.

Before the Volunteers boarded the train, a farewell rally was held at the station square by more than 3,500 local Korean people and officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army. Yang Jishan, Chairman of the People's Committee of a certain county, and General Tang Jinlong, head of the vanguard of the returning Volunteers, in their speeches, sternly warned American imperialism that it must immediately stop playing with fire. They said that if the American aggressors dared to take risks and launch a war, they would inevitably suffer an even more disastrous defeat than in the Korean War.

At the farewell rally, the Korean people and officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army also presented silk banners and gifts to the returning Volunteers, expressing brotherly fighting friendship. Zheng Hanxie, a People's Army Second Lieutenant who fought alongside the Volunteers in the Iron Ridge area counterattack and was awarded the title of Model Combatant, presented Chen Xinglong, a second-class meritorious service member of the Volunteers, with the last bullet from his pistol that remained from that battle. He said, "On the Korean battlefield, we fought side by side and defeated the American aggressor army. This bullet represents our determination to fully support you in liberating your own national territory. If the American aggressors dare to use armed force to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands, please use this bullet to eliminate them!"

After the farewell rally, the people and the soon-to-be-parted relatives and comrades-in-arms – the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers – engaged in an enthusiastic get-together.

This contingent of Volunteers, returning home triumphantly, laden with victory, honor, and friendship, made significant contributions during the Korean War and in the post-war struggle to help the Korean people restore construction and maintain the Korean armistice. They produced a total of more than 10,440 heroes and meritorious individuals, and 428 collective meritorious units.

On the eve of their departure, they were also warmly seen off by delegations sent by the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic Government, the People's Army, and the Party and government organs of a certain province. Art troupes accompanying the delegation performed wonderful performances for the officers and soldiers day and night. The broad masses of Korean people and the People's Army handover troops stationed near the area also held farewell rallies, gala evenings, and farewell banquets one after another.

When the vanguard of this returning unit was advancing from its station to the boarding station more than a hundred li away, the Korean people and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army handover troops, who were reluctantly seeing them off along the way, held hands with the officers and soldiers of the Volunteers, passing through arches of colored streamers, accompanying them for one stretch of the road after another. Along the way, many Korean people also stopped the officers and soldiers of the Volunteers from time to time, giving them apples, chestnuts, biscuits, and other items to quench their thirst and serve as dry rations for the journey.

    志愿军第三批归国部队临行发出警告
    美国败将莫忘侵朝下场
    新华社平壤25日电  中国人民志愿军第三批归国部队先头部队乘坐的第一列和平列车，已在今天下午二时五十五分（平壤时间）驶离朝鲜某地车站，沿着胜利的道路凯旋回国。
    在志愿军这支归国部队登车之前，当地三千五百多朝鲜人民和人民军官兵在车站广场上举行了欢送大会。某郡人民委员会委员长杨济善和志愿军归国先头部队首长唐金龙将军在讲话中，都严厉警告美帝国主义必须立即停止玩火行为。他们说，如果美国侵略者胆敢冒险、发动战争，将必定遭到比侵朝战争更加惨重的失败。
    在欢送会上，朝鲜人民和人民军官兵还向志愿军归国部队官兵赠送了锦旗和礼品，表达兄弟般的战斗友情。曾经在铁原地区反击战中和志愿军并肩作战、荣获模范战斗员称号的人民军少尉郑汉燮，把他在那次战斗中剩下的一颗手枪子弹，赠给了志愿军二等功臣陈兴隆，他说：“在朝鲜战场上，我们并肩作战打败了美国侵略军。这颗子弹，代表着我们全力支持你们解放自己祖国领土的决心。如果美国侵略者胆敢武装干涉中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿，就请你用这颗子弹消灭它！”
    欢送大会结束后，人们同即将离别的亲人和战友——中国人民志愿军官兵们，进行了热情洋溢的联欢。
    这支满载胜利、荣誉和友谊凯旋归国的志愿军部队，在朝鲜战争期间和战后帮助朝鲜人民恢复建设以及维护朝鲜停战的斗争中，作出了重大贡献，共涌现一万零四百四十多名英雄和功臣，四百二十八个集体立功单位。
    他们在登车归国前夕，还受到朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府、人民军和某道党政机关派出的代表团的盛情欢送。随同代表团前来送别的艺术团体，不分昼夜地为官兵们进行了精彩演出。驻地附近的广大朝鲜人民和人民军接防部队，也纷纷举行了欢送大会、联欢晚会和送别宴会。
    在这支归国部队的先头部队由驻地向一百多里以外的登车站进发时，沿途依依送行的朝鲜人民和人民军接防部队官兵，同志愿军官兵们手挽着手，穿过一道道彩门，一程又一程地相送。一路上，许多朝鲜人民还不时地拦住志愿军官兵们，把苹果、栗子、饼干等送给他们解渴和留作途中的干粮。
