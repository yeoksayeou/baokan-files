　　Ode to Dujiangyan
    By Yuan Ying

　　Standing on the cable bridge of Dujiangyan, looking west, the Min River appears as if ten million wild horses, having broken free of their reins, are galloping and roaring from the mountains of western Sichuan. The sound of the river is mighty and surging, instantly rushing over the cable bridge. The river water strikes the bridge pillars, causing the cable bridge to sway gently, enough to make those with slightly weaker nerves feel dizzy. The waves roll the large pebbles from both banks, splashing up piles upon piles of white foam along the way. Who would imagine how much havoc these ten million wild horses, running with such unrestrained vigor, would wreak and how much disaster they would bring to the people when they gallop onto the plains?
   
　　However, right here, Dujiangyan blocks their path. The great dike in the heart of the river splits the Min River into two, ordering them to go their separate ways, ordering them to tame their wild nature, obediently follow the path designated by the people, and irrigate six million mu of fertile land in western Sichuan. Dujiangyan, for more than two thousand years, what great achievements you have made for the people! Dujiangyan, when the people of Sichuan proudly call their homeland the "Land of Abundance," who can forget you!

　　Dujiangyan, you are the pride of the working people of Sichuan, the pride of the working people of China!

　　Throughout history, many feudal literati have always loved to smear great inventions and creations with mysterious religious colors. They dare not face the earth-shaking power of the working people, and can only play tricks to deceive the people. When Yu the Great controlled the floods, they said that the hero who led the masses in dredging rivers transformed into a yellow bear at night, using divine power to subdue the floods. When the Foolish Old Man moved mountains, in the writings of feudal literati, he ultimately had to rely on the help of heavenly soldiers and generals. Jiang Yan's talent overflowed because of a dream in which a brush grew from a flower; the ingenious craftsman Lu Ban was also described as mysterious and unpredictable… However, in the face of the great Dujiangyan project, they had to remain silent. Even the legends about Li Bing always say how he and his son cleverly subdued the river god and tamed the evil dragon, showing the heroic spirit of the ancient people, but dared not add any gods or monsters to it. I ask: what kind of heavenly soldiers and generals could have cut through the Lidui Mountain to allow the Min River to flow into the western Sichuan Plain? What kind of gods could have calculated the water level of the Bottle Neck so accurately? And what kind of genius could have designed such a complete and scientific water conservancy system? Only the people, the ordinary working people, they are the ocean of wisdom, the source of all power. Gods and monsters are just absurd legends in the writings of literati; only the working people can use their hands to accomplish earth-shaking feats. This was true in the past, and it is even more so in today's socialist era. Just like a folk song sings:

　　The masses united are powerful,
　　They fear no difficulty, however great.
　　They can make water flow backwards,
　　And move mountains away.

　　Yes, we cannot fail to mention Li Bing. His name will forever be associated with Dujiangyan. However, did Li Bing have any divine power? No, he was an ordinary person. His greatness probably lies in relying on the masses. Historical records state:

　　"...After the disaster was eliminated, the people were very happy, and eagerly dedicated their lives to helping Li Bing and his son excavate the pass and build the dike. There were hundreds of millions of them." The number of hundreds of millions is certainly an exaggeration, but if Li Bing and his son had simply sat idly in the prefectural governor's office, where would they have gotten the idea to discover the principles of water control, "dig deep the riverbed, keep the weir low"?

　　Inside the Two Kings Temple, which commemorates Li Bing and his son, there are not as many lifeless eulogies and fantastical descriptions as we usually see in those temples. Here, there is a unique style. On the stone walls and in the main hall are written Li Bing's six-character formula for water control and the three-character scripture on water control, and the inscriptions record the process of Dujiangyan's construction. There are also couplets signed by past bureau chiefs of the collection bureau in the main hall. The bureau chiefs of the collection bureau may not have truly understood Li Bing's achievements, and their praise of Li Bing was nothing more than a desire to associate themselves with elegance and fame, and perhaps also to eliminate some of the people's hatred for their heavy taxation. However, they dared not tell some truths. Even if the rulers tried every possible means to obliterate the power of the working people, they never dared to deny the role of Dujiangyan.

　　Today, a new group of water control heroes has come to the Two Kings Temple. They are cadres, soldiers, laborers, and students. They will create achievements that Li Bing and his son could not have completed in the same place where Li Bing and his son had sweated more than two thousand years ago. They are the builders of the Dujiang Yuzui Hydropower Station, which is about to begin construction. After this hydropower station is completed, it will increase the irrigated area of Dujiangyan by another two million mu. They will also make the turbulent flow of the Min River not only irrigate but also emit light and heat.

　　The young people are full of enthusiasm, especially since this is the famous Dujiangyan! They are challenging the ancients and have the confidence to greatly surpass them. A banner with the slogan "Learn from Li Bing's Wisdom" has been erected. More than two thousand years ago, there was only one Li Bing, and more than two thousand years later, ten thousand Li Bings have come. All the dangerous and treacherous waters are nothing in the eyes of the Li Bings of the socialist era!

　　The young people want to transform Dujiangyan. They also want to transform themselves in the process of transforming Dujiangyan. They say they want to throw individualism into the Min River along with the river water, letting it flow eastward into the sea, never to return.

　　Listen to their songs:

　　The Min River is boiling with high waves,
　　We are determined to transform it,
　　Let the river wash away the white flag,
　　And ride the rocket into the clouds.

　　One stone, one heart,
　　One heart, one lamp,
　　Lamps illuminating the land of western Sichuan,
　　Hearts facing Guankou City.

　　On Lidui Mountain beside the Bottle Neck, there is a pavilion with a very unusual name, "Tingting Pavilion," probably describing its elegant and graceful appearance. There is a couplet on Tingting Pavilion: the first line is "Directly compete with Mount Emei for beauty," and the second line is: "Still seek the source from Guankou." I have never been to Mount Emei and do not know if the first line is true. The second sentence has the meaning of thinking of the source when drinking water, reminding people to remember the heroes who dug the mountain and controlled the water in the past. This sentence is still applicable today, but it should be given new content. People should not only remember Li Bing and his son and the countless unknown water control heroes of more than two thousand years ago, but also forever remember the thousands of new Li Bings who are transforming Dujiangyan in the socialist era.

### 都江堰散歌

　　都江堰散歌
    袁鹰
    站在都江堰的索桥上，纵目西望，只见岷江像千万匹脱缰的怒马，从川西丛山中嘶叫着飞奔前来。江声浩荡，汹涌澎湃，霎时间就冲过索桥。江水撞击着桥柱，索桥上悠悠晃晃，使神经稍微衰弱些的人会目眩神摇。浪花卷着两岸的大鹅卵石，一路上溅起千堆万堆白雪。这千万匹怒马啊，谁会想像出，当它们逞着这股泼劲奔驰到平原上的时候，会发起多大的脾气，会给人民带来多少灾难？
    然而，就在这里，都江堰挡住了它们的去路。江心的大堤，把岷江劈成两半，叫它们分成两路走，叫它们收拾起野性子，乖乖地按着人民指定的道路往前走，叫它们灌溉川西六百万亩的沃土。都江堰，两千多年了啊，你为人民立下多少丰功伟绩！都江堰，当四川人民自豪地把自己的乡土说成“天府之国”的时候，谁能忘得了你！
    都江堰，你是四川劳动人民的骄傲，中国劳动人民的骄傲！
    古往今来，许多封建文人，总爱在伟大的创造发明上乱涂上神秘的宗教色彩，他们不敢正视劳动人民的移山倒海的力量，只好装神弄鬼来愚惑人民。夏禹治水，他们就说那个领导群众疏凿江河的英雄怎样在夜里化作黄熊，借着神力治服洪水；愚公移山，在封建文人的笔下，最后也非得靠天兵天将的鼎力；江淹才思洋溢，是由于梦笔生花；巧匠鲁班，也被说得神秘莫测……然而，在都江堰的伟大工程面前，他们只好哑口无言了。纵有一些关于李冰的传说，也总是说他们父子怎样智取江神，降伏孽龙，表现了古代人民的豪迈气概，却不敢在那上面加上什么神仙鬼怪。试问：有什么样的天兵天将能凿开离堆让岷江流入川西平原？有什么样的神仙能把宝瓶口的水位计算得这么精确？又有什么样的奇人能设计出这样完整而又符合科学的水利系统？只有人民，普通的劳动人民，他们是智慧的海洋，力量的总汇。神仙鬼怪，只是文人笔下的妄诞的传说，只有劳动人民，才能用双手干出惊天动地的事业。过去是如此，今天社会主义时代更是如此。就像一首民歌里唱的：
    群众团结力量大，
    天大困难都不怕，
    叫水倒流就倒流，
    叫山搬家就搬家。
    是的，我们不能不提到李冰。他的名字跟都江堰永世长存。然而，李冰难道有什么神力么？不，他是一个普通的人。他的伟大处，恐怕就在于依靠群众。史书记载：
  “……害除，民大悦，踊跃用命于冰父子挑关筑堰者亿万人。”亿万人的数字当然有夸大处，但是，如果光凭李冰父子枯坐在太守衙内，他们又能从哪里去想出“深淘滩，低作堰”的治水的规律？
    在纪念李冰父子的二王庙内，不像一般我们常见的那些寺庙里有那么多没有生命的讴歌和神乎其神的描述。这里有一些独特的风格。在石壁和大殿上，都写着李冰的治水六字诀和治水三字经，在碑文上记载着都江堰建筑的过程。大殿上也还有一些过去的征收局长之类署名的楹联。征收局长未必真懂得李冰的业绩，他之所以歌颂李冰，无非是附慕风雅，借以扬名，另方面大约也是想借此消除些人民对他们穷征暴敛的憎恨。然而他们也不敢不说些实话。统治者纵使千方百计地想抹煞劳动人民的力量，它们是始终不敢否定都江堰的作用的。
    二王庙如今来了一批新的治水英雄们。他们是机关干部、战士、民工和学生。他们要在李冰父子在两千多年前流过汗的地方，创造李冰父子所不能完成的业绩。他们是即将开工的都江鱼嘴水电站的建筑者。这水电站建成以后，将使都江堰的灌溉区再增加二百万亩。他们还要使岷江的滔滔急流，不仅灌溉，还要发出光和热。
    年青人意气昂扬，何况这又是千古驰名的都江堰！他们向古人挑战，而且有信心大大地超越古人。一幅“学李冰智慧”的标语牌树立起来了。两千多年前只有一个李冰，两千多年后来了十万个李冰，一切恶滩险水，在社会主义时代的李冰们眼里，都不在话下！
    年青人要改造都江堰。他们也要在改造都江堰的过程里改造自己。他们说要把个人主义一起抛进岷江，让它随着江水东流入海，不再回头。
    且听他们唱的歌吧：
    岷江沸腾波浪高，
    我们决心来改造，
    让江水冲倒白旗，
    乘着火箭上云霄。
    一颗石头一颗心，
    一颗心来一盏灯，
    灯灯照着川西地，
    心心向着灌县城。
    宝瓶口旁的离堆上，有座亭子，名字很新奇，叫亭亭亭，大概是描写它亭亭玉立的意思。亭亭亭上有一副对联，上联是“直与峨嵋争秀色”，下联是：“还从灌口觅源头”。我没有到过峨嵋，不知上联说的是否确实。下一句有饮水思源的意思，要人们记住当年凿山治水的英雄。这句话今天也还适用，只是应该赋予新的内容。人们不仅应该记住两千多年前的李冰父子和当时的无数无名的治水英雄，也应该永远记住社会主义时代改造都江堰的千万个新的李冰们。
