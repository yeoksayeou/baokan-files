    Not Delaying a Ton of Goods, Not Wasting a Minute
    National Transportation Movement Enters Climax

    (Our report) The mass movement of the whole Party mobilized and the whole people participating to guarantee the transportation of steel has been launched nationwide. The broad masses of people in various localities have made up their minds to race against time in the next three months or so, vigorously engaging in transportation to ensure the production of 10.7 million tons of steel.

    After the Ministry of Communications issued an emergency directive on September 17, transportation departments in various places immediately took action. Under the leadership of the local Party committee, Shanghai Port mobilized the masses and used the method of "ants moving a mountain" to unload all 116,000 tons of goods accumulated on ships in the port in two days, the 19th and 20th. The water transport situation in the Shanghai area has now improved. The port's 24-hour loading and unloading volume has reached 100,000 tons, and all employees have pledged to further increase the 24-hour loading and unloading volume in October.

    Henan Province's mass movement for transportation to ensure steel production is gaining momentum. All special zones and cities in the province have taken effective measures. Xinxiang Special Zone has put all the transportation forces of the organs, enterprises, freight cars, rural tractors into use. In order to expand transportation capacity, this special zone has begun to implement an ambitious vehicle manufacturing plan, to manufacture 10,000 trailers and 8,000 wooden sailboats this year. Zhengzhou City, in order to solve the current difficulties of insufficient transportation capacity and ensure ore transportation, has not only organized and utilized various transportation tools, but also organized bicycles from various organs to invest in ore transportation.

    The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Transportation called on all counties in the province to speed up the construction of steel transportation lines, so that where there is steel, there is a road built. The Provincial Department of Transportation also requires the transportation departments to race against time in the next three months, vigorously promoting the three-shift system for automobiles and the multi-shift system for maintenance and repair. The province's vehicle integrity rate should reach 99%. Five thousand trailers will be built in a concentrated effort within the year to realize the train-like operation of automobiles.

    Liaoning Province has decided to work hard for sixty days from September, assembling and manufacturing 1,600 trailers (each with a load of three tons), and quickly train drivers to implement a two-shift system with trailers. By the end of October, 60% of the automobiles will implement two-shift trailer transportation.

    In order to ensure steel transportation, Hunan Province is making full use of the deadweight tonnage of existing ships, loading more goods, sailing faster, and proposing to use two barges as three. Zhou Fengqing, a sailor on the "Hu Yi" No. 10 barge in this province, and Hu Zonghuan, the boatswain, adopted the method of erecting the bulkheads in each cabin as walls and tying them with oilcloth ropes to carry bulk cargo, so that a barge that could only load and unload 130 tons could load 33.5 tons more. On the voyage from Mao Caojie in Hunan to Yueyang, although it encountered winds and waves of level four or so, it still safely arrived at Yueyang Port.

    Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, installed foot-powered propellers on wooden sailboats, which doubled the transportation efficiency of wooden sailboats. After testing, wooden sailboats with a deadweight of less than 20 tons can be equipped with this "indigenous machinery" which is easy to operate and uses very little steel. If this method is widely used to transform wooden sailboats, the country can increase transportation capacity by 15 million tons.

### 不压一吨货  不误一分钟  全民运输运动进入高潮

    不压一吨货  不误一分钟
    全民运输运动进入高潮
    本报讯  全党动员全民动手保证钢铁运输的群众运动已在全国范围内展开。各地广大群众下定决心，要在今后三个多月时间内，为保证一千零七十万吨钢的生产而分秒必争地大搞交通运输。
    交通部在9月17日发出紧急指示以后，各地交通运输部门立即行动起来。上海港在当地党委的领导下，发动群众，用“蚂蚁搬泰山”的办法，在19日和20日两天就把港内积压在船舶上的十一万六千吨物资全部卸清。现在上海地区的水路运输情况已经改善。全港昼夜装卸作业量已达十万吨的水平，全体职工纷纷保证在10月份内进一步提高昼夜装卸作业量。
    河南省全民搞运输保证出钢铁的运动声势浩大。全省各个专区和市都采取了有效的措施。新乡专区把机关企业货运汽车、农村拖拉机以及一切运输力量都使用上了。为了扩大运输能力，这个专区已经开始执行一个气魄宏伟的造车计划，要在今年内制造一万辆挂车和八千只木帆船。郑州市为了解决目前运力不足的困难，保证矿石运输，不仅组织利用了各种运输工具，还把各机关的自行车也组织起来投入矿石运输。
    陕西省交通厅号召全省各县加快速度建设钢铁运输线，做到哪里有钢铁，哪里修公路。省交通厅还要求交通部门在今后三个多月内，分秒必争，大力推行汽车三班制和保养修理多班制。全省完好车率要达到99％。年内突击赶造挂车五千辆，实现汽车列车化。
    辽宁省决定从9月份开始，要苦战六十天，装造一千六百辆挂车（每辆载重三吨），并且快速训练司机，实行双班制加挂车。10月底以前将有60％的汽车实行双班制的拖挂运输。
    湖南省为了保证钢铁运输，正充分利用现有船舶的载重吨位，多装货，快航行，并提出要两只驳船当三只用。这个省的“湖佚”十号驳船的水手周丰清和水手长胡宗焕，采取了把各舱舱板竖起来做围墙，用油布绳子捆好的办法，载运散装的货物，使一只原来只能装卸一百三十吨的驳船，多装了三十三吨半。从湖南茅草街到岳阳的航程上，虽然遇到了四级左右的风浪，仍然安全到达了岳阳港。
    江苏省镇江在木帆船上安装用脚蹬的推进器，使木帆船运输效率提高一倍。经过试验，载重二十吨以下的木帆船，都可以装用这种操作轻便、使用钢材很少的“土机械”。如果普遍用这个办法改造木帆船，全国可以增加一千五百万吨的运力。
