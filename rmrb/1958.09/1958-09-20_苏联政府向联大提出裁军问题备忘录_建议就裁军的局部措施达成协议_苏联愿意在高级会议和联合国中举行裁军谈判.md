Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 19th: The Soviet delegation attending the 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly, entrusted by the Soviet government, submitted to the meeting for discussion the Soviet government's memorandum on measures for disarmament.

The memorandum pointed out that what best serves the interests of consolidating peace is: fundamentally resolving the disarmament issue, greatly reducing armed forces and armaments, completely prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons, ceasing the production of such weapons, eliminating them from the armaments of all countries, and destroying all stockpiles of these weapons. However, considering that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are unwilling to take broad disarmament measures, the Soviet government, in order to achieve practical and feasible disarmament measures as soon as possible, believes that it is necessary to reach an agreement on partial disarmament measures.

To this end, the Soviet government suggested in the memorandum that armed forces be drastically reduced: the armed forces of the Soviet Union and the United States should each be reduced to 1.7 million people, and the United Kingdom and France should each be reduced to 650,000 people.

The Soviet government agreed with the Western countries' suggestion that the disarmament of major powers could be carried out in stages, but it firmly insisted on stipulating clear and definite obligations for each country, and insisted that the transition from one stage to another should not depend on the resolution of certain political issues.

The Soviet government then suggested in the memorandum that a 15% reduction in conventional armaments be taken as the first step, and suggested that the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France undertake the obligation to reduce their military budgets by 10% to 15%.

The memorandum stated that since Western countries are not currently prepared to completely and unconditionally ban nuclear weapons, the Soviet government believes that: as a first step towards banning atomic and hydrogen weapons, governments of all countries must undertake a solemn obligation not to use any type of nuclear weapon, including airborne nuclear bombs, missiles of any range with atomic and hydrogen warheads, atomic artillery, etc.

The obligation of all countries not to use all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons should take effect simultaneously with the commencement of measures to reduce armed forces and conventional armaments. The Soviet government believes that while achieving partial measures in disarmament, governments of all countries must undertake the obligation to negotiate the formulation of the following agreement, namely, to completely ban atomic and hydrogen weapons and cease their production and to eliminate them from the armaments of all countries.

The Soviet government emphasized that the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons must be stopped immediately and universally.

The memorandum suggests reaching an agreement on measures that would preclude the possibility of using outer space for military purposes, and at the same time remove foreign military bases established on the territory of other countries.

The memorandum stated that the implementation of disarmament measures should be subject to corresponding international supervision. After an agreement is reached on the issue of disarmament, including an agreement on a substantial reduction of armed forces and armaments, a complete ban on atomic weapons and a halt to the production of atomic weapons, the elimination of atomic weapons from the armaments of all countries, and the destruction of stockpiles of such weapons, there will be no obstacles to expanding supervision and inspection. The Soviet government is prepared to take a positive attitude towards expanding supervision and inspection at the corresponding stage.

The Soviet government attaches great importance to reaching agreement on measures to prevent the danger of one country suddenly attacking another. The Soviet government suggests reaching agreement on the following issues: establishing supervisory posts at railway hubs, major ports, and on main motorways, as well as conducting aerial photography in the areas where the main armed forces of the two military blocs in Europe are concentrated, in areas 800 kilometers deep to the east and west of the demarcation line of these armed forces. The Soviet government also agreed to establish aerial inspection zones, including the Soviet Far East and an area of ​​equal size in the western United States.

The memorandum went on to say that the Soviet government supports the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory of other countries; the Soviet government suggested reaching an agreement on the following as a first step: reducing the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and other countries currently stationed in Germany by one-third or an amount agreed upon by all parties, and withdrawing the reduced personnel to their respective countries.

The Soviet government believes that countries should promulgate corresponding laws and take other measures to stop war propaganda.

The memorandum pointed out that the Soviet government is willing to hold disarmament talks at high-level meetings and in the United Nations. Considering that the composition of the United Nations body responsible for studying practical disarmament measures is one-sided, the Soviet government advocates the establishment of a permanent disarmament committee including all member states of the United Nations, or a committee with fewer members, but at least half of its members should be representatives of socialist and neutral countries.

    苏联政府向联大提出裁军问题备忘录
    建议就裁军的局部措施达成协议
    苏联愿意在高级会议和联合国中举行裁军谈判
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社纽约19日讯：出席联合国大会第十三届会议的苏联代表团，受苏联政府的委托把苏联政府关于裁军方面的措施的备忘录提交给会议讨论。
    备忘录中指出，最符合巩固和平利益的是：根本解决裁军问题、大大裁减武装部队和军备、完全禁止原子武器和氢武器、停止这种武器的生产、从各国军备中取缔这种武器并且销毁这种武器的全部储存。但是，考虑到美英法政府不愿意采取广泛的裁军措施，苏联政府为了尽速实现切实可行的裁军措施，认为有必要就裁军的局部措施达成协议。
    为此，苏联政府在备忘录中建议大量裁减武装部队：苏联和美国武装部队应各裁减到一百七十万人，英国和法国应各裁减到六十五万人。
    苏联政府同意西方国家的关于大国裁军可以分阶段进行的建议，但是它坚决主张规定各国的明确、肯定的义务，并且主张，由一个阶段过渡到另一个阶段不应该取决于某些政治问题的解决。
    苏联政府接着在备忘录中建议，把裁减常规军备15％作为第一步，并且建议苏美英法四国承担把自己的军事预算缩减10％到15％的义务。
    备忘录说，由于西方国家现在不准备完全和无条件地禁止核武器，苏联政府认为：作为禁止原子武器和氢武器的第一步，各国政府必须承担庄严的义务，不使用任何类型的核武器，包括飞机所载的核弹、带有原子弹头和氢弹头的任何射程的导弹、原子炮等等。
    各国关于不使用一切类型的原子武器和氢武器的义务应当跟开始实现裁减武装部队和常规军备的措施同时生效。苏联政府认为，在裁军方面实现了局部措施的同时，各国政府必须承担义务就拟定下列协定进行谈判，即完全禁止原子武器和氢武器并停止它们的生产和从各国军备中取缔它们。
    苏联政府强调指出，必须立即普遍停止原子武器和氢武器试验。
    备忘录建议就这样的措施达成协议，这种措施要能够排除把宇宙空间用于军事用途的可能性，并同时撤除外国在别国领土上建立的军事基地。
    备忘录说，裁军措施的执行，应该受到相应的国际监督。就裁军问题达成协议，包括就大量裁减武装部队和军备、完全禁止原子武器以及停止原子武器的生产、从各国军备中取缔原子武器并销毁储存的这种武器等达成协议后，扩大监督和检查的障碍也就不存在了。苏联政府准备在相应阶段对扩大监督和检查一事采取积极态度。
    苏联政府极其重视就防止一个国家突然进攻另一个国家的危险性的措施达成协议。苏联政府建议就下列问题达成协议：在铁路枢纽上、在大港口和在汽车公路干线上建立监督岗，以及在欧洲两个军事集团主要武装力量集结的地区、在这些武装力量分界线东西纵深各八百公里的地区进行空中摄影。苏联政府还同意建立空中视察区，包括苏联远东地区和面积相等的美国西部地区。
    备忘录接着说，苏联政府支持从他国领土撤退一切外国军队；苏联政府建议就下列问题达成协议作为第一步：把苏美英法和其他国家目前驻扎在德国境内的武装部队裁减三分之一或者经过各方商定的数额，裁减下来的人员撤回各国本国。
    苏联政府认为，应当由各国颁布相应的法律和采取其他措施来制止战争宣传。
    备忘录指出，苏联政府愿意在高级会议上和在联合国中举行裁军谈判。考虑到联合国负责研究实际裁军措施的机构的组成是单方面的，苏联政府主张成立包括联合国所有会员国在内的常设裁军委员会，或者成立一个成员较少的委员会但是其成员至少应该有一半是社会主义国家和中立国家的代表。
