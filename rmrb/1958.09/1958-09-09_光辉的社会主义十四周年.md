Glorious Fourteenth Anniversary of Socialism
Bulgarian Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, Panchevsky

　　On September 9, 1944, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and with the resolute assistance of the invincible Soviet army, the Bulgarian people carried out a nationwide armed uprising, overthrew the pro-royalist fascist dictatorship that was hostile to the people, established a people's government, and began a new era of development for themselves—the era of socialism.
　　Although our revolution has certain characteristics, its development conforms to the general laws of socialist revolution. This once again proves that Bulgaria is not developing along some "special road," as the various opportunists and revisionists, especially the leadership of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, claim, but along the path opened up by the Great October Socialist Revolution and the revolutions of other people's democratic countries—the path of proletarian dictatorship and the construction of socialism.
　　Fourteen years of development is a very short period for a country. However, in this short period, tremendous reforms have been completed in our country, and brilliant achievements have been made in continuous development. Bulgaria has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country with cooperative, mechanized large-scale agriculture and developed socialist industry (especially heavy industry). Now our country has its own machine manufacturing, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, and chemical industry departments. The contrast between heavy industry and light industry has changed from 23 to 77 in 1939 to 45 to 55 in 1957. In the total output value of the national economy, the contrast between industrial output value and agricultural output value has changed from 25 to 75 in 1939 to 68.3 to 31.7 in 1957, with industry taking the lead. Industrial production in 1957 increased nearly seven times compared to 1939. Now our industry can produce the entire output of 1939 in less than two months.
　　Our socialist agriculture has also achieved unprecedented success. Basic agricultural operations have been mechanized. Our country has a population of 7.5 million, and in the fields of cooperatives, there are nearly 25,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower) and 4,250 combine harvesters. By the end of the third five-year plan, 14,000 more tractors and 5,000 combine harvesters will be added.
　　The Bulgarian people have always resolutely pursued a policy of peaceful coexistence. The People's Republic of Bulgaria is an inseparable and strong part of the world peace and socialist camp. It strives to maintain normal and friendly relations with other Balkan countries, and it is an important factor in the world defending peace in the region. The cornerstone of our foreign policy is friendship with the Soviet Union. The Bulgarian Communist Party, the government, and all the Bulgarian people will, under any circumstances, remain loyal to the Soviet-Bulgarian friendship that is urgently needed by them, and will make unremitting efforts to further develop and strengthen it. The Bulgarian people will further consolidate their friendship with the people of other countries in the peace and socialist camp.
　　All these achievements are the result of the conscious and arduous labor of the entire nation to realize the behest of its immortal leader and mentor, Dimitrov—to build socialism in Bulgaria. But without the truly fraternal and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, these achievements would be unimaginable and impossible to obtain.
　　The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, held in June this year, made a summarized scientific analysis of these achievements and drew theoretical and practical conclusions. At the same time, the congress also discussed and adopted a grand program for building socialism in our country and put forward specific tasks during the third five-year plan. These tasks are: to ensure a more rapid development of productive forces; to prioritize the development of heavy industry on the basis of modern technology and continue the country's industrialization; to ensure the further upsurge of agriculture, greatly improve the collectivization of agricultural production and labor productivity; to further deepen and develop the cultural revolution, and further improve the material and cultural level of the working people.
　　All these achievements were obtained by our people under the wise leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the soul of the people's regime. The Party's correct policy will continue to be the primary foundation and most important condition for the smooth development of our country on the socialist road. Therefore, one of our most important tasks is to further consolidate the Party and greatly improve the Party's ideological work. Therefore, it is no accident that the Seventh Congress of the Party clearly and firmly condemned modern revisionism. Modern revisionism is most evident in the new program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In this way, the Bulgarian Communist Party once again demonstrated its purity to Marxism-Leninism and its infinite loyalty to great proletarian internationalism.
　　The People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people have always loved and admired the heroic struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of the wise and long-tested Chinese Communist Party and the great victories achieved in socialist construction. Our country was one of the first countries to establish formal diplomatic relations with China after the victory of the Chinese People's regime. Since then, the economic, political, and cultural relations between our two countries and peoples have been deepening and developing. The most important events in this regard were the visit of the delegation of the National People's Congress of China headed by Comrade Peng Zhen to Bulgaria in 1957 and the visit of the Bulgarian government delegation headed by Comrade Yugov to China. These two visits, talks, and signed documents marked a new stage in the fraternal friendship and comprehensive cooperation between our two countries and peoples. The Bulgarian people have always praised and supported the Chinese people's resolute and just struggle to liberate Taiwan from the hands of the US imperialist lackey Chiang Kai-shek clique and return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland—the People's Republic of China.
　　Let us do everything possible to further strengthen the friendship between our two peoples!
　　Long live the glorious September 9th, the festival that opened up a new and brilliant road for the Bulgarian people—the road of socialism!
　　Long live the ever-growing fraternal, unbreakable friendship and comprehensive cooperation between the Bulgarian people and the Chinese people who are achieving a great leap forward in the socialist development of their motherland under the leadership of the wise Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong!
　　Long live the powerful and invincible socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, which is unswervingly fighting for world peace!

### 光辉的社会主义十四周年

　　光辉的社会主义十四周年
　　保加利亚人民共和国驻中华人民共和国大使  潘切夫斯基
    1944年9月9日，保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的领导下，在不可战胜的苏联军队的坚决援助下，进行了全民武装起义，推翻了与民为敌的保皇法西斯专政，建立了人民政权，开始进入自己发展的新时代——社会主义时代。
    我国革命尽管有某些特点，但是它的发展是符合社会主义革命的一般规律的。这又一次证明了保加利亚并不是像形形色色机会主义者和修正主义者、首先是南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导集团所说的那样，按什么“特殊道路”发展，而是按着伟大十月社会主义革命和其他人民民主国家革命所开辟的道路——无产阶级专政和建设社会主义的道路前进。
    对一个国家来说，十四年的发展过程是非常短的。可是在这短短的时期里，在我国完成了巨大的改革，并且在不断发展中取得了辉煌的成就。保加利亚已经从一个落后的农业国变成了拥有合作化、机械化的大规模农业和发达的社会主义工业（特别是重工业）的工业农业国。现在我国有了自己的机器制造业、有色和黑色冶金业以及化学工业等部门。重工业和轻工业的对比已经从1939年的二十三比七十七变为1957年的四十五比五十五。在国民经济总产值中，工业产值同农业产值的对比从1939年的二十五比七十五变为1957年的六十八点三比三十一点七，工业占首位。1957年工业产量比1939年增加了将近七倍，现在我国工业用不到两个月的期间就能生产1939年全年的产品。
    我国的社会主义农业也获得了空前的成就。基本农业操作都已经机械化了。我国有七百五十万人口，而在合作社的田野里，差不多有二万五千台拖拉机（每台按十五马力计算）、四千二百五十台联合收割机。第三个五年计划结束时，还将增加一万四千台拖拉机和五千台联合收割机。
    保加利亚人民始终不渝地坚决奉行着和平共处的政策。保加利亚人民共和国是世界和平和社会主义阵营不可分割的坚强的一部分。它力求同其他巴尔干国家保持正常的友好关系，它是世界上保卫这个地区和平的重要因素。我国外交政策的基石是同苏联友好。保加利亚共产党、政府和全体保加利亚人民今后在任何情况下，都将始终忠于对他们迫切必要的保苏友谊，将不懈努力使它得到进一步发展和加强。保加利亚人民将进一步巩固自己同和平和社会主义阵营其他国家人民的友谊。
    这一切成就都是全国人民为实现自己不朽的领袖和导师季米特洛夫的遗训——在保加利亚建设社会主义——进行自觉的顽强劳动的结果。但是假如没有伟大苏联的真正兄弟般的无私援助，这些成就是不可能想像的，是不可能获得的。
    今年6月召开的保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会对这些成就作出了概括的科学的分析以及理论和实践上的结论。与此同时，代表大会还讨论和通过了在我国建成社会主义的宏伟纲领并提出了第三个五年计划期间的具体任务。这些任务是：保证更迅速地发展生产力；在现代技术的基地上优先发展重工业，继续进行国家工业化；保证农业的进一步高涨，大大提高农业生产的集体化程度和劳动生产率；进一步加深和开展文化革命，并进一步提高劳动人民的物质文化水平。
    这一切成就是我国人民在人民政权的心灵——保加利亚共产党的英明领导下获得的。党的正确政策今后仍将是我国在社会主义道路上顺利发展的首要基础和最重要条件。因此我们最重要的任务之一就是进一步巩固党和大大改进党的思想工作。因此党的第七次代表大会明确而坚决一致地谴责了现代修正主义并不是偶然的。现代修正主义在南共新纲领中表现得最为明显。这样，保加利亚共产党又一次显示了对马克思列宁主义的纯洁和对伟大的无产阶级国际主义的无限忠诚。
    保加利亚人民共和国和保加利亚人民一向热爱和钦佩中国人民在英明的久经考验的中国共产党的领导下所进行的英勇斗争和在社会主义建设中取得的巨大胜利。我国是中国人民政权胜利以后最早同中国建立正式外交关系的国家之一。从那时起，我们两个国家和人民之间的经济，政治和文化关系日益加深和发展。在这方面最重要的事件是，1957年以彭真同志为首的中国全国人民代表大会代表团访问保加利亚和以于哥夫同志为首的保加利亚政府代表团访问中国。这两次访问、会谈和签署的文件，标明了我们两个国家和人民的兄弟友谊和全面合作的新阶段。保加利亚人民一向赞扬和支持中国人民从美帝国主义走狗蒋介石集团手中解放台湾，使台湾重归祖国——中华人民共和国怀抱的坚决的正义斗争。
    让我们尽一切努力进一步加强我们两国人民的友谊！
    光荣的9月9日，为保加利亚人民开辟了新的光辉道路——社会主义道路的节日万岁！
    保加利亚人民同正在英明的中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下，在祖国的社会主义发展中实现着伟大飞跃的中国人民的兄弟般牢不可破的友谊，和全面合作的不断繁荣万岁！
    以坚定不移为世界和平而斗争的伟大苏联为首的、强大的不可战胜的社会主义阵营万岁！
