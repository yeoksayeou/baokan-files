According to a report in the *Dalian Daily*: Dalian Second Municipal Hospital has achieved good results in treating cancerous tumors using the traditional secret recipe, "Shen Nong Pills."

From July 1st to August 10th of this year, clinical observations of 118 cancer patients showed that the main symptoms disappeared or improved very significantly in over 59.3% of cases. Wang Liangshi, in her sixties, suffered from cancerous tumors in the perianal region in June of last year. She was diagnosed by the Liaoning Provincial Rehabilitation Hospital and the Otolaryngology Department of Dalian Medical College Hospital, with pathological tissue sections confirming "squamous cell carcinoma." In July, she underwent deep X-ray irradiation, but after the sixteenth session, the patient had a reaction and could not tolerate it. She immediately went to Dalian Second Municipal Hospital to take the traditional Chinese medicine "Shen Nong Pills." After taking the medicine, her condition gradually improved, and after about a month, the symptoms disappeared. The patient received treatment for about half a year, taking 120 doses of the medicine, after which her condition basically recovered, and her health was restored. Since stopping the medication in early February of this year, she has been doing very well. On August 27th of this year, she underwent a follow-up examination at the Otolaryngology Department of Dalian Medical College Hospital, which determined that she had basically recovered. Liu Xinggao, a sixty-one-year-old farmer, contracted gastric cardia cancer. After an exploratory laparotomy at Dalian Medical College Hospital, the tumor could not be removed due to certain reasons. He came to the Second Municipal Hospital and took only three doses of "Shen Nong Pills," and his stomach pain immediately lessened or even disappeared, and he was able to get out of bed. By the time he had taken eleven doses, he had fully recovered his health. The secret traditional Chinese medicine recipe "Shen Nong Pills" was contributed by Tang Huichen, Director of the Nutrition Department of Dalian Second Municipal Hospital.

    旅大市立第二医院应用祖国秘方
    “神农丸”能治癌肿
    据旅大日报消息：  旅大市立第二医院应用祖国秘方“神农丸”治疗癌肿，已经获得良好效果。
    从今年7月1日到8月10日，在一百一十八例癌肿病人中，据临床治疗观察，主要症状消失或好转非常明显的占59.3％以上。六十多岁的王梁氏在去年6月患了会庆癌肿，曾经辽宁省康复医院、大连医学院医院耳鼻喉科确诊，并作了病理组织切片证实为“鳞状上皮癌”。7月进行深X线照射，照到第十六次，病人发生反应，不能忍受，立即到旅大市立第二医院服中药“神农丸”；服药后，病情逐渐好转，服药到一个月左右，症状消失。这个患者治疗约半年，服药达一百二十付以后，病情已基本转愈，健康恢复。从今年2月初停药到现在，一切都很好。今年8月27日再经大连医学院医院耳鼻喉科复查，认为已基本痊愈。六十一岁的老农民刘兴杲得了胃贲门癌，在大连医学院医院剖腹后，因故未能切除，来到市立第二医院，只服了三付“神农丸”，胃痛立即减轻以至消失，也能起床了。服到十一付药的时候，他就完全恢复了健康。中药秘方“神农丸”是旅大市立第二医院营养部主任唐辉辰献出来的。
