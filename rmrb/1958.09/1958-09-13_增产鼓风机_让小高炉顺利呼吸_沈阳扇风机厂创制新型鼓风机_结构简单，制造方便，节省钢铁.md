Increase Production of Blowers to Ensure Smooth Operation of Small Blast Furnaces
Shenyang Fan Factory Creates New Type of Blower
Structure Simple, Manufacturing Convenient, Saves Steel

    (Our report) The blowers urgently needed by tens of thousands of small blast furnaces and small converters across the country have found a good method for mass production. The Shenyang Fan Factory recently created a high-pressure series centrifugal fan with a simple structure and easy manufacturing to replace the previously complex and difficult-to-manufacture blowers. The First Ministry of Machine Building requires factories across the country to widely produce this type of fan to support the great leap forward in the steel industry.
    Blast furnaces and converters of various sizes require blowers with different air volumes and air pressures. Without blowers, blast furnaces and converters cannot produce steel; if the air volume and air pressure of the blowers are insufficient, the molten steel cannot flow continuously. The inability of some small blast furnaces in various regions of the country to produce normally is mainly due to the lack of appropriate blowers. The production and supply of blowers has become one of the major issues in the current steel production.
    In the past, Ye-style blowers and Roots-style blowers were generally used for small blast furnaces of three to twenty-eight cubic meters and small converters of 0.5 to 5 tons. The structure of these two types of blowers is relatively complex and difficult to manufacture. General small factories cannot manufacture them, which makes the demand for blowers even more tense.
    The high-pressure series centrifugal fan created by Shenyang Fan Factory is made by connecting two ordinary fans in series. Its main features are: (1) simple structure, few parts, consisting of a steel plate shell, a steel plate riveted impeller, a steel shaft, and a pair of bearings; (2) simple manufacturing, mainly riveting and welding, with only the shaft, bearings, and impeller requiring a small amount of machining; (3) low precision requirements; (4) short manufacturing time. For example, it takes only over 200 man-hours to manufacture a series fan suitable for a 28-cubic-meter blast furnace; while it takes over 900 man-hours to manufacture an equivalent Ye-style blower; (5) less material used. Compared with Ye-style blowers, it can save 80% of steel. Due to these characteristics, general mechanical factories across the country can manufacture it.
    Shenyang Fan Factory has designed five types of this type of fan. Their air volume and air pressure are different. They are suitable for use in 3 to 28 cubic meter blast furnaces and 0.5 to 1.5 ton converters. If the converter is larger, two or three of these fans can also be used in parallel. However, attention should be paid to adding adjustment devices on the air duct to ensure that the air pressure between the fans is consistent, otherwise reverse air flow may occur.
    The First Ministry of Machine Building has decided to rush to produce 2,000 of these fans before the end of October. According to incomplete statistics, local factories across the country will produce 17,000 small blowers this year, the vast majority of which can adopt the specifications of this type of fan.

    增产鼓风机　让小高炉顺利呼吸
    沈阳扇风机厂创制新型鼓风机
    结构简单，制造方便，节省钢铁
    本报讯　全国数以万计的小高炉、小转炉迫切需要的鼓风机，已经找到了大量生产的良好方法。沈阳扇风机厂最近创制出一种结构简单、制造容易的高压串联离心通风机，代替了过去结构复杂、制造困难的鼓风机。第一机械工业部要求全国各地工厂广泛生产这种通风机，以支援钢铁工业大跃进。
    各种尺寸大小不同的高炉和转炉，都需要不同风量和不同风压的鼓风机。没有鼓风机，高炉和转炉就出不来钢铁；鼓风机的风量和风压不够，就不能使钢水铁水长流。目前全国各地区某些小高炉不能正常生产，缺乏适当的鼓风机也是个主要原因，鼓风机的生产和供应问题，就成为当前钢铁生产上的重大问题之一。
    过去，对于三到二十八立方公尺小高炉，零点五到五吨小转炉，一般都采用叶氏鼓风机和罗茨氏鼓风机。这两种鼓风机的结构都比较复杂，制造起来比较困难，一般小型工厂无法制造，这就使鼓风机的需要变得更为紧张。
    沈阳扇风机厂创制的高压串联离心通风机是用两台一般的通风机串联起来的。它的主要特点是：（1）结构简单，零件不多，由一个钢板做的外壳，一个钢板铆成的叶轮，一根钢轴和一对轴承组成；（2）制造简单，主要是铆焊活，只有轴、轴承和叶轮需要少量机械加工；（3）要求精度较低；（4）制造工时少。例如制造一台适用于二十八立方公尺高炉的串联风机，只要二百多工时；而制造一台相当的叶氏鼓风机，却需九百多工时；（5）使用材料少，与叶氏鼓风机比较，可少用钢铁80％。由于它具有上述特点，全国各地一般机械工厂都可能制造。
    沈阳扇风机厂已经设计出五种这种类型的风机。它们的风量、风压都不同。适合三到二十八立方公尺高炉和零点五到一点五吨转炉使用。如果转炉较大，这种风机还可以两台或三台并联使用。但是要注意在风道上加上调整装置，使风机之间的风压一致，否则会发生反风现象。
    第一机械工业部决定在10月底以前赶制出二千台这种风机。据不完全统计，全国各地的地方工厂在今年内要生产一万七千台小型鼓风机，其中绝大部分都可采用这种风机的规格。
