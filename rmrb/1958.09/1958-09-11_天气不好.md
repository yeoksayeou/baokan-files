    "Bad Weather"
    Tie Yi
    On the 9th, an Associated Press reporter aboard the U.S. Seventh Fleet flagship "Helena" sent a cable, saying: "Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Bickley announced that the Nationalist supply ships, which were originally to be escorted through the Formosa (i.e., Taiwan) Strait by U.S. warships, did not set sail.
    "This escort was originally planned to take place during the day. The U.S. warships were prepared to ignore the newly announced twelve-nautical-mile limit of Red China, but..."
    But, why didn't they set sail? The Associated Press reporter said: "Due to bad weather." Therefore, "the planned delivery of supplies to the besieged Quemoy Island was cancelled."
    "Bad weather" is certainly unsuitable for travel. But what kind of bad weather was it? The Associated Press reporter didn't mention a word about the weather, nor did Vice Admiral Bickley's announcement, and I can't find any weather reports for the Taiwan area on the 9th, which makes it really difficult to figure out.
    However, the Associated Press reporter revealed some information in its cable: "This escort, if carried out, would have been the third since Sunday. On Sunday (i.e., the 7th), Nationalist ships unloaded ammunition without being disturbed by Communist artillery fire. During Monday's escort (this was the second time), one supply ship was destroyed by Communist shells." So, what about the third time? "The planned schedule was cancelled." The reason is that the Americans thought the "weather was bad" - artillery fire can affect changes in the political climate.
    However, I would also like to add a little information: On the 7th, Comrade Khrushchev wrote a letter to Eisenhower. One passage in this letter mentioned the U.S. fleet, saying that warships today, apart from being "used for ceremonial visits and firing salutes," are only good for serving as "targets for suitable types of rockets." Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that these words might hurt the self-esteem of those who have close ties with the Navy. In fact, more importantly, it affected the "climate" on the Taiwan Strait.
    It seems that the political climate in the Taiwan area is indeed not very good for the American generals, but this has not hurt Vice Admiral Bickley's self-esteem, because he has found a new explanation: "Bad weather." He also told the Associated Press reporter that the climate in the Taiwan Strait is only good in "August, late April, and May," and "at other times, the Formosa sea is very turbulent..." It turns out that this general, who is used to wielding guns, is also like a natural scientist. He knows so much, and it's no wonder he doesn't blush.
    According to Vice Admiral Bickley, the Seventh Fleet is "the largest complete naval force that any country has ever deployed in peacetime." It is "about twice as large as the Sixth Fleet that the United States landed in Lebanon in July this year." According to the Americans, it can be called "the best in the world" among the world's naval fleets, but it is extremely afraid of bad weather. U.S. Vice President Nixon once angrily expressed his opinion on the Taiwan situation, saying: "The United States cannot play the role of a paper tiger!" However, the Seventh Fleet's cancellation of the planned escort proves once again that the American bandits are just paper tigers. The facts are already there, what's the use of not admitting it!

    “天气不好”
    铁衣
    9日，美联社美国第七舰队旗舰“海伦那”号随舰记者发了一个电讯，说：“舰队司令比克利海军中将宣布说：本来要由美国军舰护送过福摩萨（即台湾）海峡的国民党供应舰没有起航。
    “这次护航本来是要在白天进行的。美国军舰本来准备不理睬红色中国新宣布的十二海里界限，但……。”
    但，为什么不起航了呢？美联社记者说：“由于天气不好。”所以“预定的运送供应品去受围的金门岛的计划取消了。”
    “天气不好”，当然是不宜出行的。但不知是怎样的不好法？美联社记者关于天气的事一个字也没有提，比克利海军中将宣布的话中也没有一个字提到天气，我手边又找不到9日台湾附近的气象报告材料，真是使人探也探不清，猜也猜不透。
    不过，美联社记者在它的电讯里还向我们露了一些话：“这次护航如果进行的话，本来是星期日以来的第三次。星期日（即七号）那天，国民党的船只在没有受到共产党炮火干扰的情况下卸下了弹药。在星期一（这是第二次）护航时，有一艘供应船被共产党炮弹所击毁。”那末，第三次呢？“预定的计划取消了。”原因是美国人认为“天气不好”，——大炮是可以影响政治气候的变化的。
    不过，我还想替它补充一点情况：7日赫鲁晓夫同志写给艾森豪威尔一封信。这封信中有一段提到了美国的舰队，说：现在的军舰除了“用作礼节上的访问和鸣鸣礼炮”以外，就只剩下充当“适当类型的火箭的打靶目标”的份儿了。赫鲁晓夫同志指明，这些话可能会伤害那些同海军有紧密关系的人的自尊心。其实更重要的还是它影响了台湾海面上的“气候”。
    看来，台湾地区的政治气候，对于美国将军们确实有些不大好，但是，这并没有伤害了比克利海军中将的自尊心，因为他找到了新的说法：“天气不好”。他还对美联社的记者说：台湾海峡这地方只有“8月、4月底和5月”的气候才是好的，“在其他的时候，福摩萨海面非常不平静……。”原来这位惯弄枪杆的将军，还好像是一个自然科学家，他懂得这么多，也就难怪他脸不红了。
    据比克利中将介绍，第七舰队是“任何国家在和平时候曾经部署过的最大的完整的海军部队”。它“比美国今年7月在黎巴嫩登陆时的第六舰队大约大一倍”。照美国人的说法，这是可以在世界海军舰队中称为“老子天下第一”的，但是，它却极怕天气不好。美国副总统尼克松，曾经对台湾局势气呼呼地发表意见说：“美国不能扮演纸老虎的角色！”然而，第七舰队的取消预定的护航计划，的确又证明着美国强盗们，不过是只纸老虎而已。事实已经摆这那里，不承认又有什么法子呢！
