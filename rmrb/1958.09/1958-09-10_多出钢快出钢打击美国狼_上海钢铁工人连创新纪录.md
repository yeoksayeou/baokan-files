Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 9th: The U.S. imperialists' provocative acts of expanding aggression in the Taiwan Strait and continuously sending warships to invade our territorial waters have repeatedly angered Shanghai's steel workers. In recent days, Shanghai steel workers have continuously set new production records.

　　In the No. 1 Converter Workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, three steelmaking furnaces were roaring with flames on the evening of the 6th. The broadcast loudspeaker transmitted Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait and the news that U.S. imperialism was expanding its aggression in the Taiwan Strait. The steelworkers' blood suddenly boiled like molten steel. They unanimously declared: "Blow faster, produce steel faster, pour molten iron faster, transport steel ingots faster, crane operators run faster, support the liberation of Jinmen and Mazu, and liberate Taiwan!" That night, they created a new record of 836 tons of steel produced in a single day, which was six tons more than the previous highest daily output. On the 7th, 2.5 million people in the city took to the streets in demonstrations. The steelworkers in this workshop created a new record of 848 tons of steel produced in a single day.

　　Workers in the open-hearth furnace workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant have broken the conventional practice of charging materials through two furnace doors in the past few days. Braving the flames rushing out of three furnace doors, they put nearly 20 tons of cold materials into the open-hearth furnace in 30 to 40 minutes, which is half the time it used to take. On the 7th, when the C shift and the A shift workers were about to hand over, a furnace of steel began to be charged. The A shift workers came to work early to help the C shift with charging, and the C shift workers stayed late to help the A shift, jointly creating a new achievement of completing the charging in 16 minutes, which shortened the smelting time of this furnace of steel by half an hour. The B shift of the Third Branch of the Xinhu Steel Plant reached an output of 35.577 tons at the midnight shift on the 6th, exceeding the Great Leap Forward target by 4.6%, creating a new high production record since the expansion of the plant. The young workers of the First Branch made reasonable division of labor as soon as they went to work on the morning of the 7th, shortening the time for changing the rolling mill by half, and overfulfilled the Great Leap Forward plan for this shift by 32%.

　　At the construction site of the blast furnace of the No. 1 Steel Plant and the construction site of the new converter workshop of the No. 3 Steel Plant, the People's Liberation Army soldiers and construction workers participating in the construction also resolutely expressed their determination to complete the work ahead of schedule to support the production of the steel industry and strike at the American aggressors. On the construction site of the No. 3 Plant, the workers broke the conventional practice that high-altitude operations could not be carried out at night in the past. On the night of the 6th, they hoisted the highest chimney on the third converter overnight, reducing the speed from eight days for the first one to three days.

　　多出钢快出钢打击美国狼
    上海钢铁工人连创新纪录
    据新华社上海9日电　美帝国主义在台湾海峡扩大侵略和接连派遣军舰侵犯我国领海的挑衅行为，一次再次地激怒了上海的钢铁工人。连日来，上海钢铁工人已不断创造出新的生产纪录。
    在上海第一钢铁厂第一转炉车间里，6日傍晚三座炼钢炉正在熊熊地喷着火焰，广播喇叭里传来了周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明和美帝国主义要在台湾海峡扩大侵略的消息。炼钢工人的血液顿时像钢水一样沸腾起来。他们一致发出豪语：“吹炼快，出钢快，铁水倒的快，钢锭运的快，行车跑的快，支援解放金门、马祖，解放台湾。”当天深夜，他们创造了日产八百三十六吨钢的新纪录，比过去最高日产量还多六吨。7日，全市二百五十万人上街示威游行，这个车间的炼钢工人们又创造了日产八百四十八吨的最高纪录。
    上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间的工人，这几天打破了过去两个炉门进料的常规，冒着三个炉门冲出来的火焰，用三四十分钟时间，就把近二十吨冷料投入了平炉，比往常快了一半。7日的丙班和甲班工人快要交接班的时候，一炉钢开始进料了。甲班工人提早上班，帮助丙班进料，丙班工人迟下班帮助甲班，共同创造了十六分钟完成进料的新成绩，使这炉钢的冶炼时间缩短了半小时。新沪钢铁厂三分厂乙班在6日深夜十二点班产量达到三十五点五七七吨，超过跃进指标4.6％，创造了这个厂扩建以来的高产新纪录。一分厂青年班工人7日早晨一上班就作好合理分工，把换轧辊的时间缩短了一半，超额32％完成了这一班的跃进计划。
    第一钢铁厂高炉工地上和第三钢铁厂的新转炉车间工地上，参加建设的解放军战士和建筑工人们，也坚决表示要提前完工，支援钢铁工业的生产，打击美国侵略者。三厂工地上工人们打破了过去黑夜不能进行高空作业的常规，6日夜里连夜把第三座转炉上最高的一座烟囱吊装完毕，速度从第一座的八天缩短到三天。
