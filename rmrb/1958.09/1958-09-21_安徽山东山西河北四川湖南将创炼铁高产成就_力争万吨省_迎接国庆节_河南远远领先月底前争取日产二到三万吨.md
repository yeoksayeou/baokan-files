(This article) reports that in the last ten days of September, many regions are taking new measures to ensure the completion of iron and steel production tasks for September. Now, Henan, Anhui, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Sichuan, Hunan and other provinces have proposed to leap their daily pig iron output to more than 10,000 tons before the end of September, creating outstanding achievements to welcome National Day.

Henan Province, creating the high-yield record of a "ten-thousand-ton province" for pig iron, the Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference and a broadcast rally for the iron and steel leap forward on the 18th, putting forward new goals to the province: to transform the high-yield record of pig iron on the 15th into the normal daily output of the province, and strive to reach a daily output of 20,000 to 30,000 tons of pig iron before the end of September. To respond to this call, the iron and steel army of the whole province is stepping up the construction of roads, increasing the production of ore, coal and coke, and taking various measures to overcome the five barriers to iron and steel production: the mine barrier, the coal barrier, the transportation barrier, the technology barrier and the equipment barrier.

The Standing Committee of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee issued a new combat call on September 5: "Work hard on iron and steel, and strive for a daily output of 10,000 tons of pig iron in the province!" And demanded that counties with better conditions fight for a daily output of 1,000 tons of pig iron. The Anqing and Lu'an Special Zones are organizing more than 700,000 iron and steel troops, advancing into the Dabie Mountains to set up camps, panning for sand, mining, building furnaces, and smelting iron. The people of Jinzhai, Yuexi, Dangtu, Fanchang, and Guangde counties are ambitious and are fighting for a daily output of 1,000 tons of pig iron.

Shandong Province's goal is to guarantee that the daily output of pig iron in the province will reach and exceed 10,000 tons before National Day, and create several counties with a daily output of 1,000 tons of pig iron. To this end, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee has held emergency meetings of the Standing Committee and telephone conferences of municipal and prefectural party committee secretaries in recent days, calling on the party, government, army and people of the province to mobilize urgently, work hard for ten days, and fight the first Huaihai Campaign in iron and steel production. To ensure the completion of this task, the Provincial Party Committee requires that 60% to 70% of the more than 33,000 various types of indigenous blast furnaces built in the province be put into production as soon as possible; and that 60% of the blast furnaces put into production reach normal production. At the same time, it requires all localities to build another 100,000 various types of indigenous blast furnaces as soon as possible.

The recently concluded Enlarged Session of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee called on the whole party and people of Shanxi Province to further exert their efforts to strive for a daily output of 10,000 tons of iron as a gift to National Day. The Enlarged Session of the Provincial Party Committee also decided to revise the original target of 1.1 million tons of iron and 700,000 tons of steel this year to 1.5 million tons of pig iron and 800,000 tons of steel. The Enlarged Session of the Provincial Party Committee required that party organizations at all levels above the county level in the province must regard the completion of iron and steel production plans as the most urgent political task at present, and further strengthen the leadership of iron and steel production.

Hebei Province, whose daily output of pig iron entered the ranks of 1,000 tons from the 18th, has also proposed to fight hard for ten days and strive to reach a daily output of 10,000 tons of pig iron by the end of September. Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, at the on-site meeting held by the Hebei Provincial Iron and Steel Headquarters on the 17th to introduce the normal production and high-yield experience of small blast furnaces in Shijiazhuang, called on the people of the province to use all opportunities with a spirit of determination, and do everything possible to concentrate manpower and material resources to ensure a daily output of 10,000 tons of pig iron by the end of the month, and a daily output of 20,000 tons of pig iron in the province by mid-October.

Party organizations at all levels in Sichuan Province have taken action to implement the Provincial Party Committee's instructions on iron and steel production, and must resolutely ensure that the daily output of pig iron in the province reaches 10,000 tons by the end of September as a gift to National Day.

The Hunan Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference on September 11, putting forward combat tasks to the people of the province, requiring the province to produce 10,000 tons of pig iron per day and a total output of 150,000 tons by the end of September.

    安徽山东山西河北四川湖南将创炼铁高产成就
    力争万吨省　迎接国庆节
    河南远远领先月底前争取日产二到三万吨
    本报讯　在9月份的最后十天中，许多地区都在采取新的措施，保证完成9月份的钢铁生产任务。现在已有河南、安徽、山东、山西、河北、四川、湖南等省提出要在9月底前把生铁日产量跃进到万吨以上，创造出优异的成就迎接国庆节。
    创造生铁“万吨省”高产纪录的河南省，中共省委已在18日召开了电话会议和钢铁跃进广播大会，向全省提出了新的奋斗目标：要把15日的生铁高产纪录变为全省正常的日产量，争取在9月底以前，全省日产生铁达到两万吨到三万吨。为了响应这一号召，全省钢铁大军正在加紧赶修道路，增产矿石、煤炭和焦炭，采取各种办法抢渡钢铁生产的五关——矿山关、煤炭关、运输关、技术关和设备关。
    安徽省委常委会在9月5日已发出新的战斗号召：“拼命干钢铁，为全省日产万吨生铁而奋斗！”并要求条件较好的县为日产一千吨生铁而斗争。安庆、六安两专区正组织七十多万钢铁大军，开进大别山区安营扎寨，淘砂、开矿、建炉、炼铁。金寨、岳西、当涂、繁昌、广德五个县的人民雄心勃勃，正为日产千吨生铁而奋战。
    山东省的指标是：保证国庆节前全省生铁日产量达到和超过一万吨，并创造出几个生铁日产千吨县。为此，中共山东省委连日来已召开了紧急常委扩大会议和市、地委书记电话会议，号召全省党政军民紧急动员起来，苦战十天，打好钢铁生产上的第一个淮海战役。为了保证完成这一任务，省委要求全省已建成的三万三千多座各式土高炉，要保证有60％到70％从速投入生产；在投入生产的高炉中又要有60％达到正常生产。同时要求各地从速再建十万座各式土高炉。
    刚刚结束的中共山西省委扩大会议，号召山西省全党全民要进一步发挥干劲，争取日产万吨铁向国庆节献礼。省委扩大会议并且决定把原定今年产铁一百一十万吨，钢七十万吨的指标，修改为生铁一百五十万吨，钢八十万吨。省委扩大会议要求全省县以上的各级党组织必须把完成钢铁生产计划，当作当前最紧急的政治任务，更进一步加强钢铁生产的领导工作。
    从18日起生铁日产量进入千吨行列的河北省，也已提出奋战十天，争取在9月底使生铁日产量达到万吨。中共河北省委第一书记林铁在河北省钢铁指挥部17日召开的介绍石家庄小高炉正常生产及高产经验的现场会议上，号召全省人民要以破釜沉舟的精神，利用一切时机，千方百计地集中人力物力，保证月底达到日产生铁一万吨，十月中旬全省达到日产生铁两万吨。
    四川省各级党组织都已行动起来，执行省委的钢铁生产的指示，要坚决保证在9月底达到全省日产生铁一万吨，向国庆节献礼。
    中共湖南省委曾在9月11日召开了电话会议，向全省人民提出了战斗任务，到9月底为止，要求全省日产生铁万吨，总产量达到十五万吨。
