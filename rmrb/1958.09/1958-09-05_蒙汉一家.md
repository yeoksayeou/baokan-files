　　Mongols and Hans are One Family

    Friendship as Evergreen as Pine and Cypress
    Some time ago, Ongniud Banner, a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area in Inner Mongolia, held a mobilization meeting for a great leap forward in animal husbandry production and organized the directors of various pastoral cooperatives to visit the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative to see the mountain management project. When the directors of the pastoral cooperatives saw that the Red Flag Cooperative lacked draught animals and many Han Chinese members were pulling carts to deliver manure, they all enthusiastically expressed their willingness to provide draught animals to support them. Subsequently, after exchanging production experiences, the hosts and guests agreed that in order to achieve a leap forward in the agricultural cooperative, it was necessary to increase livestock and manure; for the pastoral cooperative to develop, it needed to establish a feed base and solve the problems of feed seeds, water sources, and planting techniques. As a result, twelve pastoral cooperatives immediately established ties with the Red Flag Cooperative, deciding to launch a major collaboration between rural and pastoral areas.
    Half a month later, young herdsmen from the Ulan Oboo Pastoral Cooperative drove a herd of breeding livestock and draught cattle, traveling from three hundred li away, camping out in the open for six days and nights, and crossing the desert to deliver gifts to the Red Flag Cooperative. To thank the herdsmen brothers for their deep friendship, the Red Flag Cooperative farmers specially selected a batch of fine seeds and two pairs of Angora rabbits as return gifts, and sent three members to the grasslands with the herdsmen to help the pastoral cooperative manage the feed base and plant vegetables. The Han Chinese members held the hands of the pastoral cooperative members tightly, seeing them off for more than ten li, and bid each other farewell, saying: "Under the leadership of the Party, the friendship between our Mongol and Han people will be as evergreen as pine and cypress!"
    In the past two months, the Red Flag Cooperative has received more than one million jin of sheep manure and forty-three heads of livestock from the support of twelve pastoral cooperatives. At the same time, the Red Flag Cooperative also gave each pastoral cooperative 2,200 jin of seeds, seven pairs of Angora rabbits, and a batch of agricultural tools, and sent eight households of members who were good at growing garden plots and feed to settle in the pastoral cooperatives.
    Relatives in the Depths of the Grassland
    One day this spring, a blizzard swept across the Hulunbuir Grassland. Workers from the Gu'enzhalaga State-owned Ranch drove thirty ox carts loaded with fodder to support neighboring ranches. In the blizzard, a Han Chinese worker named Wang Lichen got lost and separated from the group, driving his ox cart aimlessly on the vast grassland. He walked from noon until dawn the next day, and the ox could not walk anymore, and the man was so frozen that he could not hold on. Just as he was at his wit's end, he suddenly saw something like a grass cart shaking in front of him. He ran up to take a look and found that it was a haystack. Then he saw a group of sand dunes appearing in front of him. Based on his memory, he guessed that there might be yurts nearby. Encouraged by this glimmer of hope, he walked and crawled, and finally found a yurt.
    An old herdsman helped up the person in distress, gave him milk to drink, helped him move his limbs, and then took him into the yurt. The old herdsman and his family took care of Wang Lichen's food, drink, and sleep carefully, and also dried his clothes. Because of the language barrier, Wang Lichen did not know the names of the family, nor could he communicate directly. He could only express his inner gratitude to the herdsmen with constant smiles and gestures.
    The next day, the blizzard stopped, and Wang Lichen was anxious to get on his way. The old man was worried that he would get lost in the snow again, so he went out to explore the road, and then harnessed his son to a horse-drawn sled to take Wang Lichen to a nearby town, allowing him to return safely to the ranch.
  Even now, Wang Lichen, with excitement, tells everyone about his escape story. Later, he found out that the relatives he met in the depths of the grassland were members of a household in the Wugunor Pastoral Cooperative of Chen Barag Banner, and the old herdsman was named Aobu.
    Marna's New Leather Shoes
    Just as the sky was slightly bright, Marna, a Mongolian girl from the First Agricultural Cooperative of Tucheng Township, Zhuozi County, Ulanqab League, put on her blue robe, straddled her beloved little red horse, and went to the Sandaoying market. She planned to use the pocket money she had saved to buy a pair of new leather shoes. Passing by Yingkou Village, the little red horse was thirsty. Marna was looking for a bucket when she suddenly heard a child crying from a courtyard.
    Marna curiously walked into the house to visit and was taken aback: a teenager was lying on the kang, holding his stomach and shouting. Several middle-aged people were squatting on the ground, all with sad faces. One person said: "This is appendicitis. It can only be cured if it is sent to the Hohhot Hospital quickly. If it's a few hours later, his life will be..." Before he finished speaking, a middle-aged man stood up and said with a mournful face: "Alas! We don't have the money to buy train tickets right now!"
    Marna had lived with the Han Chinese for many years and understood all these words. Her heart thumped non-stop. She thought, could she stand by and watch a child suffer like this? Her hand reached into her pocket and quickly pulled it out again: this was the money she was going to use to buy new leather shoes! As soon as this thought flashed through her mind, she blamed herself: Marna, you usually say that the Mongol and Han farmers are one family, but when it comes to the point, you are like this. Are you like a Communist Youth League member? Thinking of this, she said decisively: "Uncle! Let's go, I have money." She didn't bother to water her horse, and while hurriedly riding her little red horse, she said to the middle-aged man: "I'll go to the station to buy tickets, you carry the patient to the station!"
    In the evening, Marna rode her little red horse home in the moonlight. Although she didn't wear her new leather shoes, she was very happy in her heart.

    友情如松柏长青
    前些时候，内蒙古的半农半牧区——翁牛特旗举行了畜牧业生产大跃进誓师大会，并组织各牧业社主任到红旗农业社去参观治山工程。牧业社主任们看到红旗社缺乏耕畜，许多汉族社员拉着车送粪，大家都热情地表示：愿意拿出役畜来支援他们。接着，宾主们经过互相交流生产经验，认为农业社搞跃进，必须增加牲畜、粪肥；牧业社要发展，需要建立饲料基地，解决饲料种籽、水源和种植技术问题。于是，当场就有十二个牧业社同红旗社挂了钩，决定展开农村牧区大协作。
    半个月以后，乌兰敖都牧业社的青年牧民赶着一群种公畜和耕牛，从三百里外经过六昼夜露宿野餐，穿越沙漠，来到红旗社送礼。为了酬谢牧民兄弟的深情厚谊，红旗社农民特地挑选出一批优良种籽和两对长毛兔作为回礼，并派出三个社员随同牧民们一道到草原上去，帮助牧业社管理饲料基地和种植蔬菜。汉族社员紧紧地拉着牧业社员的手，相送十几里，临别时互相赠言：“在党的领导下，我们蒙汉族人民的友情将如同松柏长青！”
    两个多月以来，红旗社已经得到十二个牧业社支援的羊粪一百多万斤，牲畜四十三头。同时，红旗社也赠给各牧业社种籽二千二百斤，长毛兔七对和一批农具，并派遣八户擅长种园田、饲料的社员到牧业社安家立户。
    草原深处有亲人
    今年春季的一天，呼伦贝尔草原上刮起了漫天风雪，顾恩扎拉嘎国营牧场的工人们赶着三十辆满载着饲草的牛车，去支援友邻牧场。在暴风雪中，一个名叫王立臣的汉族工人迷途失群，赶着牛车在茫茫草原上乱走，从午后走到第二天天亮，牛走不动了，人也冻得支持不住，正是走投无路，焦急万状，他忽然看见面前晃着一个草车似的东西，就跑上去一看，原来是个草垛，接着又看见前方出现了一群沙丘。凭着记忆，他猜想这附近可能有蒙古包。在这一线希望的鼓舞下，他连走带爬，终于寻到了一个蒙古包。
    一个年老的牧民扶起了这个遇险的人，给他喝牛奶，帮助他活动四肢，然后接进蒙古包里去。老牧民和他一家人细心地照料王立臣吃喝睡眠，还给他烤干了衣服。因为语言不通，王立臣不知道这家人的名字，也不能直接交谈，只能用不断的微笑和手势，向牧人们表示内心的感激。
    第二天风雪停止，王立臣急着要赶路，老人不放心，怕他又要在雪地上迷失方向，就出去探路，然后同他的儿子套上马拉爬犁，把王立臣送到附近的小镇，让他安全地回到了牧场。
  到如今，王立臣怀着激动的心情，见人总讲起这次脱险的故事。后来才打听到他在草原深处遇到的亲人是陈巴尔虎旗乌固诺尔牧业社的一家社员，那位老牧民名叫敖布。
    玛尔娜的新皮鞋
    天刚麻麻亮。乌兰察布盟卓资县土城乡第一农业社的蒙古族姑娘玛尔娜，穿上蓝色的长袍，跨上心爱的小红马，到三道营去赶集。她准备用平日积蓄的零钱，买一双新皮鞋。路过营口村，小红马渴了，玛尔娜正在那里找水桶，忽然听到一座院子里传来孩子的哭声。
    玛尔娜好奇地走进屋里探望，不禁吃了一惊：一个十几岁的孩子躺在炕上抱着肚子直喊叫，地下蹲着几个中年人，都是愁眉苦脸的，有一个人说：“这是盲肠炎，只有赶快送到呼和浩特医院去才能治好，再晚几个钟头，命就……”话没说完，站起一个中年人，哭丧着脸说：“唉！这会子没有买火车票的钱呵！”
    玛尔娜多年同汉族住在一起，这些话全懂得。她的心突突地跳个不停，她想，眼看着一个孩子痛的可怜，能见死不救吗？她的手伸进衣袋里，很快地又抽出来：这是自己买新皮鞋的钱哪！脑子里刚闪过这个念头，她就责备起自己来了：玛尔娜呀，你平常会说蒙汉农民是一家，事到临头却这样，像个共青团员吗？想到这里，她果断地说：“大爷！走，我有钱。”她顾不上饮马，一边急忙骑上小红马，一边对这中年人说：“我去车站买票，你们往车站抬病人吧！”
    傍晚，玛尔娜骑着小红马踏着月色回家了，她虽然没有穿上新皮鞋，心里却很高兴。
