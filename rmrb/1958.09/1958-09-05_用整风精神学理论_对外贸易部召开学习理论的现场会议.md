　　Using the Spirit of Rectification to Study Theory
    The Ministry of Foreign Trade Holds an On-Site Meeting to Study Theory

    (Our Newspaper) The various units of the Ministry of Foreign Trade have launched a mass upsurge in studying theory. Since mid-July, all employees of the Ministry of Foreign Trade (including support staff), continuing with the spirit of rectification, have actively responded to the Party Committee's call and have successively studied Chairman Mao's "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's work report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, among other documents. During the study process, the masses of employees have generally connected it to their own thoughts and work, examining and criticizing problems in their ideology and way of thinking.

    Although the systematic theoretical study of the Ministry's employees has only been going on for a month and a half, using Marxist-Leninist theory to explain and solve practical work problems has become a common phenomenon. The Market Research Institute, which studies capitalist market conditions, has a relatively high concentration of senior intellectuals, many of whom have relatively serious bourgeois ideology or revisionist viewpoints, which have long affected the improvement of market research work and the ideological transformation of intellectuals. After the theoretical study began in July, the institute's leadership, based on this objective reality, launched a high tide of anti-revisionism on the basis of raising the ideological awareness of employees, exposing and criticizing the revisionist viewpoints of researchers within the institute. This not only educated each comrade, but also improved everyone's Marxist-Leninist ideological level, and also helped the smooth development of market research work. Niu Chuanlian, a commodity clerk at the China Transportation Machinery Import Company, criticized the bourgeois individualism of being unwilling to pass on years of accumulated business experience to others and changed his style through the study of the general line theory. Now, he has not only taken on two apprentices, but is also systematically summarizing his work experience, preparing to contribute everything to the people.

    This theoretical study of the Ministry of Foreign Trade is being carried out with leadership and planning. The Minister and Vice Ministers serve as study reporters, bureau directors and managers as natural tutors, and section chiefs as natural study group leaders. The Party branches also fully exert their initiative and enthusiasm in organizing and leading the theoretical study.

    In order to exchange learning experiences and further promote the in-depth development of theoretical study, in addition to holding a small theoretical study exhibition based on the initial results of the study, the Ministry also held an on-site theoretical study meeting on September 3, where advanced units introduced their experiences. In addition to members of the leading groups of each unit of the Ministry, Party branch committee members, tutors, and study group leaders, representatives from the Party Committee of Central Government Departments and various central ministries also participated in this on-site meeting.

　　用整风精神学理论
    对外贸易部召开学习理论的现场会议
    本报讯　对外贸易部各单位掀起了群众性的学习理论的热潮。从7月中旬以来，对外贸易部全体职工（包括勤杂人员），继续以整风精神，积极响应党委号召，先后学习了毛主席的“关于农业合作化问题”、刘少奇同志在中共八大二次会议上的工作报告等文献。在学习过程中，职工群众普遍联系思想和工作实际，检查和批判了思想方法、思想意识中的问题。
    该部职工系统学习理论虽然还只一个半月的时间，但运用马列主义理论来解释、解决实际工作中的问题，已成为普遍现象。研究资本主义市场行情的行情研究所，高级知识分子比较集中，其中有不少人存在着比较严重的资产阶级思想或修正主义观点，长期来影响了行情研究工作的提高和知识分子的思想改造。7月份理论学习开始后，该所领导上即根据这一客观存在的事实，在职工思想认识提高的基础上，掀起了一个反修正主义的高潮，揭发、批判了所内研究人员中的修正主义观点，不仅教育了每个同志，也提高了大家的马列主义思想水平，而且有助于行情研究工作的顺利开展。中国运输机械进口公司商品员牛传链，通过总路线理论学习，批判了不肯把多年积累的业务经验传授给别人的资产阶级个人主义思想，转变了作风。现在，他不仅带了两个徒弟，而且正在系统总结自己的工作经验，准备全部贡献给人民。
    对外贸易部这次理论学习，是有领导、有计划地进行的。部长、副部长担任学习报告员，局长、经理为当然辅导员，处长为当然学习组长。各党支部也充分发挥对理论学习组织领导的主动性、积极性。
    为了交流学习经验，进一步推动理论学习深入开展，该部除根据学习的初步成绩，举办了一个小型理论学习展览会外，还于9月3日召开了一个理论学习现场会议，由学习先进单位介绍经验。参加这次现场会的，除该部各单位领导小组成员、党支部委员、辅导员、学习小组长外，还有中央国家机关党委和中央各部的代表。
