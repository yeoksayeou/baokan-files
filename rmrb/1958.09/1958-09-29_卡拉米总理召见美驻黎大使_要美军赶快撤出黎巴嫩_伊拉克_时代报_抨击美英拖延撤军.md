Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: Beirut News: Lebanon's new Prime Minister Karami and his cabinet members were sworn in yesterday morning.

Following the swearing-in ceremony, Karami immediately summoned the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon, McClintock. According to authoritative sources, Karami told McClintock that the new Lebanese government hopes that U.S. troops will withdraw from Lebanon as quickly as possible.

Prior to this, Lebanon's new Foreign Minister, Philippe Takla, also held talks with McClintock, similarly raising the demand for the earliest possible withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanese territory.

The U.S. troops that invaded Lebanon numbered more than 14,000, and under the strong opposition of the Lebanese people and world public opinion, 4,000 have been withdrawn successively. White, the U.S. State Department's press officer, announced in Washington on the 26th that there is no "definite deadline" for when the remaining U.S. troops will withdraw from Lebanon.

Shamun, the U.S. running dog who has been spurned by the Lebanese people, and his henchmen are carrying out frantic activities, plotting to overthrow the Karami cabinet in order to allow the U.S. aggressor troops to occupy Lebanon for a long time without leaving. In addition to directing the reactionary Phalangist and National Social Party thugs to carry out frantic sabotage activities, Shamun also convened his party members at his home on the 27th to plot opposition to the Karami cabinet in parliament. Karami has said that he will request a vote of confidence from the parliament for his government.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, September 27th: "Al-Zaman" newspaper published an editorial on the 26th, criticizing U.S. and British imperialism for stubbornly delaying the withdrawal of their troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The editorial said that there are indications that the imperialists hope to delay the withdrawal of their troops as much as possible. The newspaper also said that statements by U.S. and British officials have confirmed this attitude.

The newspaper also said that the Arab people are determined to regard forcing the British and American troops to withdraw from the Middle East as the primary task of maintaining peace and security in the Middle East.

    新华社28日讯  贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩新总理卡拉米和他的内阁成员在昨天上午宣誓就职。
    卡拉米在宣誓就职后立即召见美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克。据权威人士透露，卡拉米向麦克林托克表示，黎巴嫩新政府希望美国军队尽可能快地撤出黎巴嫩。
    在此以前，黎巴嫩新外交部长菲利普·塔克拉也曾经同麦克林托克进行会谈，同样提出了使美军尽早撤出黎巴嫩领土的要求。
    侵入黎巴嫩的美国军队共有一万四千多名，在黎巴嫩人民和世界舆论的强烈反对下已经有四千人先后撤走。美国国务院新闻发布官怀特26日曾经在华盛顿宣布，剩下的美军何时撤出黎巴嫩还没有“肯定的限期”。
    遭到黎巴嫩人民唾弃的美国走狗夏蒙和他的喽罗们正在猖狂进行活动，阴谋推翻卡拉米内阁，以便使美国侵略军能够长期盘踞黎巴嫩不走。除了指挥反动的长枪党和国家社会党党徒猖狂进行破坏活动以外，夏蒙27日还在他的家里召集他的党羽开会，策划在议会中反对卡拉米内阁。卡拉米曾经说，他将要求议会对他的政府举行信任投票。
    据新华社巴格达27日电“时代报”在26日发表社论，抨击美英帝国主义顽固地拖延把它们的军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退。社论说，有迹象表明，帝国主义者希望尽量拖延撤退它们的军队。这家报纸又说，美英两国官员的声明证实了这种态度。
    这家报纸又说，阿拉伯人民决心把迫使英美军队从中东撤退看作是维护和平和中东安全的首要任务。
