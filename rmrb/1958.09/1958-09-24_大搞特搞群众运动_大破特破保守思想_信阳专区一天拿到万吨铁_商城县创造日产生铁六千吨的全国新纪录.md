Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 23rd: Henan's Xinyang Special District launched a major iron smelting satellite on the 21st – the entire district's daily pig iron production reached 10,310 tons, with an additional 2,182 tons of sintered ore produced. This is the first "ten-thousand-ton district" to emerge on the national iron and steel industry front thus far.

On this day, Shangcheng County in Xinyang Special District produced 6,191.53 tons of pig iron and 1,880.8 tons of sintered ore, setting the highest daily pig iron production record in the province.

When the people of the county launched a competition with Yu County in steel production, they first engaged in a fierce battle with conservative thinking. Before the competition even started, some retreatists hung up the "no war" banners, saying, "We have no coke, we lack power and blowers, our furnaces are of poor quality and few in number, and we have no foreign blast furnaces. How can we compete with them?! We can't catch up even if we break our legs. It's better to be content." Some even said, "We have already exerted all our strength; we can't produce even one more ton." In response to these arguments, the Shangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party launched a large-scale debate throughout the county. During the debate, the promotion faction argued: If there is no coke, there is inexhaustible firewood, which can be used to replace charcoal; if there is a lack of power and blowers, human and animal-powered blowers can be manufactured; if the furnaces are of poor quality and few in number, they can be rebuilt and newly built; if there is no foreign blast furnace, we can rely on indigenous blast furnaces. At the same time, it was pointed out that the first "satellite" launch lacked experience, and the potential had not been fully utilized; now that we have experience, production will definitely increase significantly. This powerfully criticized the "conservative faction's" conditionalism and the theory that production had reached its peak.

Through this large-scale debate, the masses were further mobilized and their thinking was liberated. At the same time, the Shangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Party committees at all levels further adopted many specific measures to ensure the great leap forward in steel production. In addition to the First Secretary continuing to take the lead, the number of committee members leading steel production increased from the original eleven to twenty-one, and the number of district-level cadres increased from the original eighty-nine to one hundred and twenty-four. In order to supply iron ore, fuel, and smelting equipment in a timely manner, specialized teams for mining, panning, transportation, charcoal burning, and equipment manufacturing were organized in various places, and labor was rationally allocated. By the 20th, the county had stockpiled more than 26,000 tons of ore and iron sand, more than 50,000 tons of charcoal, and more than 1,000 newly made wooden bellows, and had built 3,321 new iron smelting furnaces of various types in five days. The Shangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also summarized and promoted the high-yield experience of the "Surpassing America" iron smelting indigenous furnace of the Iron and Steel People's Commune, which produced five and a half tons per day. According to this experience, the output of each of the 535 iron smelting furnaces rebuilt in various places was more than four tons higher than before.

On the 21st of this month, 4,893 iron smelting furnaces in Shangcheng County were put into production. Now, the people of this county are advancing with even greater vigor and taking advantage of their victory. Their slogan is: Maintain normal production and continue to launch large "satellites" of 10,000 tons of iron per day.

### 大搞特搞群众运动　大破特破保守思想  信阳专区一天拿到万吨铁  商城县创造日产生铁六千吨的全国新纪录

    大搞特搞群众运动　大破特破保守思想
    信阳专区一天拿到万吨铁
    商城县创造日产生铁六千吨的全国新纪录
    据新华社郑州23日电　河南信阳专区在21日放出了炼铁大卫星——全专区日产生铁达到一万零三百一十吨，外产烧结铁二千一百八十二吨。这是截至目前为止，在全国钢铁工业战线上出现的第一个“万吨专区”。
    这一天，信阳专区的商城县产生铁六千一百九十一点五三吨，外产烧结铁一千八百八十点八吨，创造了全省日产生铁最高纪录。
    全县人民在钢铁生产上同禹县展开竞赛的时候，首先同保守思想进行了一次恶战。因为竞赛还没有开始，有些促退派就挂起了免战牌，说什么“我们一没有焦炭，二缺乏动力、鼓风机，三炉子质量差、数量少，四没洋高炉，怎能同人家竞赛呢？！跑断腿也赶不上，还是安分点儿好。”有人还说：“我们已经尽了九牛二虎之力，一吨也多不了。”中共商城县委针对这些论点，在全县开展了大辩论。在辩论当中，促进派认为：没有焦炭，但有烧之不尽的木柴，可以用木炭代替；缺乏动力、鼓风机，可以制造人力、畜力鼓风机；炉子质量差数量少，可以改建和新建；没有洋高炉，可以依靠土高炉。同时指出：第一次放“卫星”缺乏经验，潜力还没有充分发挥；现在有了经验，生产一定能大大提高。这就有力地批判了“保守派”的条件论和生产到顶论。
    通过这次大辩论，进一步发动了群众，解放了思想。同时，中共商城县委和各级党委，还进一步采取了许多保证钢铁生产大跃进的具体措施。县委除了第一书记继续挂帅以外，领导钢铁生产的委员由原来的十一人增加到二十一人，区级干部由原来的八十九人增加到一百二十四人。为了及时供应铁矿石、燃料和冶炼设备，各地组织了开矿、淘砂、运输、烧炭和设备制造等专业队，合理地调配了劳动力。到20日止，全县就储备矿石和铁砂二万六千多吨，木炭五万多吨，新制木风箱一千多个，并且在五天中新建各种炼铁炉三千三百二十一座。中共商城县委还总结和推广了钢铁人民公社“超美”号炼铁土炉日产五吨半的高产经验，各地根据这个经验改建的五百三十五座炼铁炉，每炉的产量比以前提高了四吨多。
    本月21日这天，商城县有四千八百九十三座炼铁炉投入生产。现在，这个县的人民正在以更大的干劲乘胜前进。他们的口号是：保持生产正常化，继续放日产万吨铁的大“卫星”。
