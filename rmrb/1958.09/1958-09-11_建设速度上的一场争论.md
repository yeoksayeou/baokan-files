    A Debate on Construction Speed
    By Our Correspondent
    The No. 1 Beijing Thermal Power Plant's turbine generator unit generated electricity ahead of schedule on the 9th, which is a significant contribution to the extremely tight power supply situation in Beijing after the Great Leap Forward in industrial production.

    During the construction process, a fierce struggle took place over whether it could be completed ahead of schedule: Should we give full play to the subjective initiative of the people and be boldly original, or should we be conservative and lag behind? Should we prioritize the construction of projects related to production and put them into operation as soon as possible, or should we complete all projects, both productive and non-productive, and then hand them over to the production departments for use in an "orderly" manner?

    The thermal power plant project started in August of last year. The Fourth Engineering Bureau, which was contracted to build the plant, had built four power plants before and felt that building this thermal power plant was nothing special. In the first quarter of this year, many units implemented the spirit of the Great Leap Forward and formulated leap forward plans, but this engineering bureau formulated a regressive plan that would delay power generation.

    During the rectification campaign, the Party committee of the construction unit first vigorously overcame the shortcomings in its own work, and at the same time launched a "Be a Promoter or Be a Regressor" debate among all employees. Workers questioned: "Why doesn't the administrative leadership consult with the workers when making plans?" In order to strive for early power generation, the workers adopted a method of simultaneous construction and installation on a large scale. When some materials and equipment arrived late, they tried every means to make up for the lost time. For example, after the crane originally designed for the boiler room was canceled, they had to temporarily use a gin pole for hoisting when installing the boiler. The designers designed the gin pole incorrectly. The designers revised it once, and the workers worked overtime to "rush" once, delaying the construction period for more than twenty days. Still, the workers used every means to complete the boiler installation as quickly as possible.

    At this time, some engineering and technical personnel insisted on the so-called "normal" "construction procedures" and "regular production order," opposing the masses' various unconventional initiatives. They disliked the masses' "rush" construction and sloppy workmanship, believing that it was "too chaotic" and "dangerous." When producing softened water, two engineers from the power plant and the installation unit believed that the fastest it could be done was half a month, or seven days even with the leap forward. But after a discussion between the workers and technicians, it was completed in just over a day.

    Despite the obstruction of various conservative ideas, the employees did not slacken their efforts. On the contrary, they became more motivated, and their will to fight against right-leaning conservative ideas became stronger, finally enabling the power plant to generate electricity ahead of schedule.

    It seems that there are two construction methods in industrial capital construction: One method is to follow old conventions, according to a set of so-called regular procedures, constructing slowly and listlessly. This method is obviously not the method we want to adopt; the other method is to boldly break through all old conventions, and under the conditions of ensuring quality and safety, try every means to speed up the progress of the project, first building projects related to production, so that the factory can be put into production at the fastest speed. For those projects that are not related to production or can be done after production, they should be postponed until after production. This method is precisely the route we should follow in construction.

    建设速度上的一场争论
    本报记者
    北京第一热电厂汽轮机发电组9日提前发电了，它对北京工业生产大跃进后供电十分紧张的局势是一个很有意义的贡献。
    在施工过程中关于能不能提前建成的问题，却经过一场激烈的斗争：是发挥人民群众主观能动性大胆独创、还是因循守旧迟迟不前？是尽先建设与生产有关的工程并使它提前投入生产，还是生产与非生产性的工程全部建好了再循“序”交付生产部门使用？
    热电厂工程，是去年8月开工的，包建这个厂的第四工程处曾经盖过四个电厂，如今建造这个热电厂他们总认为算不了什么。今年第一季度许多单位就贯彻了大跃进的精神，制订了跃进计划，这个工程处却订了个迟迟才能发电的促退计划。
    整风运动中，施工单位的党委首先大力克服自己工作中的缺点，同时发动全体职工展开了“做促进派还是做促退派”的大辩论。工人们提出质问：行政领导上“为什么订计划不跟工人商量？”工人们为了争取提前发电，大量采取一边施工、一边安装的办法，有些材料和设备来晚了，就想尽一切办法抢回失去的时间。例如锅炉房原来设计的吊车被取消后，在安装锅炉时只好临时采取拔杆来吊装，设计人员又把拔杆设计错了。设计人员修改一次，工人就加班“突击”一次，先后耽搁工期二十多天，工人们还是用一切办法尽快完成了锅炉的安装工作。
    这时候，有些工程技术人员却在坚持所谓“正常”的“施工程序”和“正规的生产秩序”，反对群众各种打破常规的倡议。他们看不惯群众“突击”施工和交差施工，认为这样“太乱”“有危险”。制作软化水时，电厂和安装单位两名工程师认为最快是半个月，现在跃进了，也得七天。但经工人和技术人员一讨论，只一天多时间就作出来了。
    尽管有各色各样的保守思想的阻挠，但职工们并没有因此松劲，相反地，干劲更足，同右倾保守思想作斗争的意志更旺盛，终于使电厂提前发电。
    看来，在工业基本建设中有两种建设方法：一种方法是按照陈规，按照一套所谓正规的程序，慢慢腾腾冷冷清清地施工。这种方法显然不是我们要采用的方法；另一种方法是，大胆的冲破一切陈规，在保证质量和安全的条件下，千方百计地加快工程进度，首先建好与生产有关的工程，使工厂用最快的速度投入生产。对于那些与生产无关或者可以在生产以后再做的工程，都放到投入生产以后再做。这种方法正是我们在建设上应当遵循的路线。
