Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 9th. Despite the De Gaulle government's use of various means to try to get the dictatorial "Constitution" passed, the movement of French Republicans against this "Constitution" is still growing as the date of the "referendum" approaches.

    The Administrative Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor called on the working people of the country to vote against the "referendum." The call pointed out that De Gaulle's draft "Constitution" is "the most serious threat to Republican freedom" and aims to deprive the national working class of the few freedoms it has won. The call emphasized that voting against it means that the French people reject dictatorial rule and that they hope to establish a Republican government based on the people to implement new policies.

    The French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement on the 9th, protesting the De Gaulle government's prohibition of the General Confederation of Labor from using radio and television to broadcast, post slogans, and distribute leaflets on the "referendum" issue.

    The National Committee of the French Teachers' Union, the French Education Workers' Union belonging to the "French Catholic Labor Confederation," and the National Committee of the left-wing "Young Republicans" have also expressed their opposition to the new draft "Constitution."

    According to the "l'Humanité" newspaper, the total amount of voluntary donations from the French working people to the National Fund for the Defense of the Republic has reached 100.5 million francs so far.

    Faced with the serious choice between Republic or dictatorship, peace or war, obvious divisions have emerged within the various bourgeois parties. Judging from the attitude expressed by most of the Socialist Party's provincial committees to date, the division within the party is unprecedented: although Socialist Party General Secretary Mollet is doing his best to serve De Gaulle, fourteen provincial committees (including the most important Seine provincial committee) have passed resolutions to vote against the "referendum." Among the approximately thirty-eight provincial committees that passed resolutions supporting De Gaulle's "Constitution," many people also opposed this "Constitution."

    The committees of the Radical Socialist Party in the Seine, Tarn-et-Garonne, Seine-et-Oise, and Meurthe-et-Moselle provinces have also expressed their opposition to the De Gaulle "Constitution." Due to serious internal divisions, the party's parliamentary group failed to make a decision on whether to adopt a supportive or oppositional attitude at its meeting on the 6th. Opposing members included Mendès-France, Daladier, Baylet, Souc, Charrelan, and Bonnel. Supporting members walked out of the meeting and refused to participate in the vote.

    Even within parties like the "Popular Republican Movement" and the "Independent Party," many people oppose the De Gaulle "Constitution." When the National Committee of the "Popular Republican Movement" passed a resolution supporting this draft "Constitution," twelve members expressed their opposition. When the parliamentary group of the "Independent Party" and the party's National Central Steering Committee passed a resolution supporting this draft "Constitution," Isorni and Mondel also expressed their opposition. The French people are shouting: "Say no to De Gaulle!"

### 堵住戴高乐走向法西斯的道路  法国反对独裁“宪法”运动高涨

    堵住戴高乐走向法西斯的道路
    法国反对独裁“宪法”运动高涨
    新华社巴黎9日电　尽管戴高乐政府利用种种手段企图使独裁“宪法”获得通过，法国共和人士反对这个“宪法”的运动仍然随着“公民投票”日期的临近而日益规模巨大。
    法国总工会行政委员会号召全国劳动人民在“公民投票”中投反对票。号召书指出，戴高乐的“宪法”草案是“对共和自由最严重的威胁”，目的在于剥夺全国工人阶级所争得的本来就很少的自由。号召书强调说，投反对票就是表明法国人民拒绝独裁统治，表明他们希望建立一个依靠人民的共和政府来执行新的政策。
    法国总工会9日发表声明，抗议戴高乐政府禁止总工会就“公民投票”问题利用广播电台和电视台进行广播、张贴标语和分发传单。
    法国教师工会全国委员会、属于“法国天主教劳工联盟”的法国教育工作者工会和左翼的“青年共和党”全国委员会也分别表示反对新“宪法”草案。
    据“人道报”报道，迄今为止，法国劳动人民自愿捐献的保卫共和国全国基金总额已经达到一亿零五百万法郎。
    在共和还是独裁、和平还是战争的严重抉择面前，各资产阶级政党内部出现了明显的分化。从迄今为止社会党大多数省委会表示的态度来看，该党内部的分裂情况是空前的：尽管社会党总书记摩勒竭力为戴高乐效劳，还是有十四个省委会（包括最重要的塞纳省委员会）通过了在“公民投票”中投反对票的决议，在通过了支持戴高乐“宪法”的决议的大约三十八个省委会中也有很多人反对这一“宪法”。
    激进社会党在塞纳、塔恩—加隆、塞纳—瓦兹和默尔特—摩泽尔等省的委员会也先后表示反对戴高乐“宪法”。该党议会党团在6日的会上由于内部分歧严重，没有能就采取赞成还是反对态度作出决议。反对的议员有孟戴斯—弗朗斯、达拉第、贝累、苏克、夏勒兰和博内尔等人。赞成的议员退出了会场，拒绝参加表决。
    就连“人民共和党”和“独立党”这样的政党内也有不少人反对戴高乐“宪法”。“人民共和党”全国委员会通过支持这个“宪法”草案的决议时有十二名委员表示反对。“独立党”议会党团和该党全国中心指导委员会通过支持这个“宪法”草案的决议时，也有伊索尼和蒙戴尔两人表示反对。法国人民高呼：“对戴高乐说不！”
