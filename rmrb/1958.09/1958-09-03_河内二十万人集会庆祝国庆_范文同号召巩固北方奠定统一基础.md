Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 2nd: The capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, held a grand military parade and a rally and demonstration of 200,000 people this morning to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

　　The newly built Ba Dinh reviewing stand and grandstand stand majestically in Ba Dinh Square. The officers and soldiers of the People's Army participating in the military parade were all dressed in new standard-issue military uniforms.

　　When the Vietnamese Labor Party and state leaders, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, stepped onto the reviewing stand, cheers shook the entire square.

　　Prime Minister Pham Van Dong delivered a lengthy National Day speech to the masses.

　　He firmly demanded that the American interventionists get out of South Vietnam and accused the United States of carrying out provocative activities in the Taiwan area.

　　Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said that the struggle to unify the country and complete the national and people's democratic revolution throughout the country is the sacred task of all the Vietnamese people, and the Vietnamese people must persist in the struggle until complete victory is achieved.

　　Pham Van Dong said that the 13th National Day anniversary of Vietnam is being held in a situation where the Vietnamese people and the people of the world have achieved many new victories. Pham Van Dong pointed out that the countries in the socialist camp, headed by the great Soviet Union, are victoriously building socialism and have made positive contributions to maintaining and consolidating world peace, defending national independence, and promoting the cause of human progress. The anti-imperialist struggles of the oppressed nations are also being victoriously carried out in Asia, Africa, Latin America, especially in the Middle East and Near East.

　　Pham Van Dong then pointed out that North Vietnam has successfully completed the economic recovery period and, starting this year, is carrying out the country's three-year construction plan. The purpose of the three-year plan is to initially develop and transform the national economy and establish a new culture in accordance with the socialist path.

　　After outlining the main tasks of the Vietnamese people on the economic and cultural fronts, Pham Van Dong said that relying on the strength of the people of the whole country, on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance and under the leadership of the working class, we are determined to overcome all difficulties and build a consolidated North to serve as the foundation for the struggle for peaceful reunification of the country.

　　General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, reviewed the various military branches and issued orders to the entire army, calling on them to improve their fighting will and revolutionary vigilance and be prepared to deal with all provocations by the enemy at any time.

　　After the military parade, the masses began their demonstration. The colorfully dressed parade shouted the slogan "Marching towards socialism" as they passed the rostrum.
