Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 25th: Reports from Beirut indicate that the Lebanese reactionaries, led by outgoing President Chamoun, have been creating chaos in the Lebanese capital in recent days. They are attempting to use this as a pretext for the U.S. military to delay its withdrawal and to obstruct the formation of a new Lebanese government led by opposition leader Karami as Prime Minister.

    The Phalangist Party and the National Social Party, supported by Chamoun, have recently carried out a series of armed provocations. On the morning of the 24th, armed bandits from the Phalangist Party and the National Social Party went around Beirut forcing business owners to close, attempting to implement their so-called "general strike." Any business that opened was attacked, and many shops were burned down. They also built barricades in the streets, arbitrarily attacked pedestrians, and burned vehicles.

    These rampant activities by armed bandits to disrupt normal life were met with resistance from the people and insurgents. On the morning of the same day, insurgents engaged in fierce gun battles with armed bandits from the Chamoun group, lasting for two hours. It was announced that more than ten people were killed and more than fifty were injured on both sides.

    Government troops, with the help of the people, stopped these reactionary bandits' attempts to create chaos. The Beirut Garrison Command immediately issued an order authorizing the army to execute on the spot anyone found carrying weapons in the streets, and to bombard houses found to be harboring armed bandit snipers. The army occupied the Phalangist Party's private radio station, thereby extinguishing this center of incitement to chaos. As such, the situation in Beirut is now under the control of the authorities.

    It is worth noting that the invading U.S. military authorities are exploiting this chaotic situation, taking the opportunity to deploy more troops into the city of Beirut under the pretext of "tense situation," attempting to intimidate the Lebanese insurgents and people who are fighting back against the saboteurs. The U.S. Embassy in Beirut issued a statement on the 24th, announcing that the U.S. military occupation authorities have decided to increase patrols along the road from Beirut Airport to the U.S. military garrison area. At the same time, U.S. tanks were deployed around the U.S. Embassy. U.S. military police and amphibious tanks filled the streets. Despite the state of emergency imposed by the Lebanese authorities, U.S. military vehicles continued to drive around the streets at will. On the same day, the U.S. Ambassador discussed the "Lebanese situation" with the Commander-in-Chief of the Lebanese Army.

    Lebanese opposition leader Salam, in condemning the reactionaries who created the bloodshed yesterday, pointed out that these people have become "tools used by imperialism to achieve its goals." He said that the recent events "prove that foreigners still harbor malicious intentions, plotting to harm our country and people, and attempting to prolong foreign occupation."

    夏蒙集团在贝鲁特进行武装挑衅
    侵黎美军借机扩大侵略
    新华社大马士革25日电  来自贝鲁特的消息说，以刚下台的总统夏蒙为首的黎巴嫩反动派这几天一直在黎巴嫩首都制造混乱。他们企图借此为美军拖延撤退制造借口，并且阻挠以反对派领袖卡拉米为总理的黎巴嫩新政府的成立。
    夏蒙所支持的长枪党和国家社会党最近进行了一系列武装挑衅活动。24日清晨，长枪党和国家社会党的武装匪徒即四出强迫贝鲁特的工商业主停业，企图实行他们所搞的“总罢工”。凡是开门营业的都遭到他们的袭击，有许多商店因此被烧掉。他们还在街头修筑街垒，任意袭击行人和烧毁车辆。
    这些武装匪徒破坏正常生活的猖獗活动遭到人民和起义者的回击。当天上午，起义者同夏蒙集团的武装匪徒发生了激烈的枪战，战斗延续了两小时。据宣布，双方有十多人死亡，五十多人受伤。
    政府军队在人民的帮助下制止了这些反动匪徒制造混乱的企图。贝鲁特卫戍司令部当即发出命令，授权军队可以对在街上发现的任何带有武器的人就地枪决，同时对发现隐藏有武装匪徒狙击手的房屋进行炮轰。军队占领了长枪党私设的广播电台，从而扑灭了这个制造混乱的煽动中心。这样，贝鲁特的局势已经在当局控制之下。
    值得注意的是，侵黎美军当局利用这种混乱情况，乘机以“局势紧张”为借口把军队增派到贝鲁特市内，企图对回击破坏分子的黎巴嫩起义者和人民进行恫吓。美国驻贝鲁特大使馆24日发表了一项声明，宣布美军占领当局决定增强从贝鲁特机场到美军驻扎地区沿路的巡逻队。同时，美国使馆周围也布满了美军坦克。美军宪兵和水陆两用坦克布满街头。尽管黎巴嫩当局实施戒严，美军车辆仍然随意在街上开来开去。当天，美国大使即同黎巴嫩陆军总司令讨论了“黎巴嫩的局势”。
    黎巴嫩反对派领袖萨拉姆在谴责昨天制造流血事件的反动分子时指出，这些人已经成为“帝国主义利用来达到它的目的的工具”。他说，最近发生的事件“证明外国人仍然怀着恶意，阴谋伤害我们的国家和人民，企图延长外国占领”。
