Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hebei, and Yunnan provinces' "pioneers" are mobilizing and organizing forces from all aspects to establish steel transportation lines, rushing to build bridges and pave the way, and transporting grain and provisions for the Steel Marshal's grand campaign.

Henan Province has recently organized several million people to rush to build steel transportation lines. By the end of August, three highways had been built in the remote western Henan mountain area, and five more will be completed and open to traffic in a few days. Various regions have also built more than 9,500 kilometers of local roads and simple highways. Now, the transportation departments are organizing automobiles from agencies and enterprises, and are also manufacturing a large number of trailers, implementing double or triple shifts to rush to transport "grain" for the steel industry. In the case of insufficient automobiles and ships, the province has also organized tens of thousands of rubber-tired horse-drawn carts and millions of large carts to join the steel transportation front.

A mighty transportation army in Anhui Province is working hard day and night, rushing to transport "grain" for the steel industry. This transportation army includes 1,239 automobiles, 537 ships, 446 horse-drawn carts, 46,738 flatbed carts, and 20,712 wooden sailboats.

In order to support the Steel Marshal's quick rise to power, Changhua, Qingtian, Qingyuan, Lin'an, Yuhang and other places in Zhejiang Province have universally constructed transportation networks suitable for mountainous areas, such as bamboo strip aerial cableways, steel wire ropeways, wooden rail skidways, balance beam roadways, and bamboo and wood chutes, and are transporting large quantities of ore and charcoal materials. At present, the transportation departments of Zhejiang Province are summarizing the experience of the above-mentioned areas and preparing to promote it comprehensively.

The transportation departments of Hebei Province are carrying out a "ten thousand trailer" movement to improve the transportation capacity of automobiles. Many regions are changing the two wheels of large carts to four wheels, iron wheels to rubber wheels, and are organizing agricultural cooperatives to engage in sideline business with large carts and handcarts, as well as automobiles from agencies and enterprises, to vigorously support the steel industry.

The Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province has independently established a transportation bureau. The prefecture and counties have established transportation companies to organize automobiles and horse-drawn carts separately, and the folk transportation horse-drawn carts and caravans have also formed transportation brigades. Originally, there were only more than 300 professional horse-drawn carts in the prefecture; now, after concentrating some horse-drawn carts from agricultural cooperatives, there are more than 2,500, under unified leadership and unified transportation arrangements. The automobiles of each county are also concentrated by the prefecture in about 20 vehicles to ensure the needs of key transportation.

    河南安徽等省组织运输大军
    为钢铁元帅搭桥开路
    据新华社11日讯　河南、安徽、浙江、河北和云南省的“先行官”从各方面动员组织力量建立钢铁运输线，为钢铁元帅升帐突击架桥开路、运送粮饷。
    河南省最近组织了几百万人赶修钢铁运输线。到8月底，在偏僻的豫西山区已经建成三条公路，还有五条再过几天也可以建成通车。各地并且修建了九千五百多公里的地方道路和简易公路。现在交通部门正在组织机关企业的汽车，并且大量制造拖车，实行双班或三班制，为钢铁工业突击赶运“粮食”。在汽车、轮船不足的情况下，全省还组织了几万辆胶轮马车和上百万辆的大车，加入了钢铁运输战线。
    安徽省一支浩浩荡荡的运输大军正在日夜苦战，为钢铁工业抢运“粮食”。参加这支运输大军的有汽车一千二百三十九部，轮船五百三十七只，马车四百四十六辆，平板车四万六千七百三十八辆，木帆船二万零七百十二只。
    浙江省昌化、青田、庆元、临安、余杭等地为了支援钢铁元帅尽快升帐，普遍建设了竹片架空索道、钢丝索道、木轨滑车道、天平车道、竹木滑道等适合山区特点的运输网，正在大量输送矿石和木炭材料。目前，浙江省交通运输部门正在总结上述地区的经验，准备全面推广。
    河北省交通运输部门正在开展“万辆拖车”运动，以提高汽车的运输能力。许多地区都在把大车的两轮改成四轮，铁轮改成胶轮，并且组织农业社搞副业的大车和手推车以及机关企业的汽车，大力支援钢铁工业。
    云南省大理白族自治州已经单独成立了交通局，州和县分别成立了运输公司，把汽车、马车分别组织起来，民间运输的马车、马帮也分别组成运输大队。原来全州专业马车只有三百多辆；现在把农业社部分马车集中以后，已有二千五百多辆，统一领导，统一安排运输。各县的汽车，也由州里集中二十多部，以保证重点运输需要。
