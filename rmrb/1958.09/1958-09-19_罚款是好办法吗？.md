    Are Fines a Good Solution?
    I recently went on a business trip to Jinci Town in Taiyuan City and discovered that the local sanitation authorities are using fines to motivate units or individuals who are not doing well in sanitation. The fines range from fifty, one hundred, two hundred, to three hundred yuan. A small horse-drawn carriage inn run by an elderly couple was fined one hundred yuan and forced to close for a month. I believe that using fines to force the masses to improve sanitation is a passive approach. The active approach should be to conduct thorough and meticulous publicity and education work. Only by truly getting the masses to understand the importance can sanitation be improved. Jinci Town rarely does this kind of work; tasks are assigned and that's the end of it. Neither the town mayor nor the Party committee secretary personally participate in inspections. If things continue like this, their sanitation work will not be successful.

    罚款是好办法吗？
    我最近出差到太原市晋祠镇，发现这里的卫生领导机关用罚款的办法来刺激卫生搞得不好的单位或个人。有五十，一百，二百，三百元不等。有一家小马车客店是老俩口开的，就被罚了一百元，并被迫停止营业一个月。我认为用罚款的办法来强迫群众搞好卫生是消极的办法，积极的办法应该是深入细致地进行宣传教育工作，只有真正使群众的思想搞通了，才能把卫生搞好。晋祠镇很少做这些工作，任务布置下去就完事，镇长和党委书记也没亲自出马来参加检查，这样下去，他们的卫生工作是搞不好的。　　　李国辉
