    Are Warehouses Enough?
    Masses in Yangzhou and Xiangtan Special Zones Launch Crash Program to Build Warehouses
    (Our report) Yangzhou Special Zone in Jiangsu Province, in response to the massive increase in grain production, has launched a surge of "vacating houses to serve as warehouses and donating materials to build storage facilities" in every commune and team. In less than a month, the prepared storage capacity is equivalent to the total grain warehouse basic construction tasks of the entire province for the past two years. Initially, the peasants did not consider what to do with the excess grain. Many people thought: "As long as we harvest it, we won't have to worry about where to put it." After the Yangzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the slogan "Three reserves for surplus grain from bumper harvests (referring to unified arrangements for state, agricultural cooperatives, and members to reserve), work hard for ten days to prepare warehouses, and welcome the autumn bumper harvest," the masses quickly changed their views, and a "preparing warehouse" upsurge was launched everywhere in a very short time. At an evening gathering in Nanwan Agricultural Cooperative, Anfeng Township, Xinghua County, the building materials donated by the masses were enough to build a warehouse that could hold 700,000 jin of rice. Members of the Lianyi Agricultural Cooperative in Tangzhuang Township, Gaoyou County, voluntarily vacated large and good houses to use as grain warehouses, adjusting the residences of ten households and arranging twenty-nine storage rooms.
    Among the prepared warehouses, some are newly built mud-wall, thatched-roof warehouses on the threshing grounds, costing very little. Each 10,000 jin of storage capacity only costs six or seven yuan to buy bamboo. Others are empty houses vacated by farmers. The masses welcome this fast and good method. Both the Dongfang Agricultural Cooperative in Xinghua County and the Xujia Agricultural Cooperative in Gaoyou County built a mud-wall, thatched-roof warehouse on the threshing ground of each production team, which saves materials and reduces labor for transportation. The rice is dried on the threshing ground and then put into storage. (Liang Guangjing)
    (Our report) This year, Xiangtan Special Zone in Hunan Province will achieve an overall bumper harvest, with a total grain output of up to 12 billion jin. After completing the state procurement tasks and the portion of grain managed by the members themselves, the agricultural cooperatives will store about 5 billion jin of grain. However, the original storage capacity of the agricultural cooperatives is less than 400 million jin, leaving a shortage of 4.6 billion jin of storage capacity. However, some township and commune cadres are blindly optimistic, believing that as long as there is grain, there will be no problem finding a place to put it. The grain bureau and grain management stations in the entire region promptly reported the above ideological situation to the Party committee. Under the unified arrangement of the Party committee, most counties have established special organizations, with the Party committee taking the lead, mobilizing farmers throughout the county to actively build warehouses to welcome the bumper harvest. The Taiping Commune Party branch in You County put forward the requirement of "Every commune has a general warehouse, every team has a branch warehouse, and seeds have a special warehouse," and within ten days, a batch of warehouses capable of holding 850,000 jin of grain were built.
    When helping agricultural cooperatives solve the problem of warehouse shortages, Xiangtan Special Zone conscientiously implemented the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical results. From the beginning, it proposed the principle of "mainly renovating and expanding, supplementing with new construction; adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and making use of waste." The vast majority of warehouses in the entire region are renovated from civilian houses, generally costing very little. For example, the Jiangbei Grain Management Station in Changsha County helped fifty-six agricultural cooperatives improve and build 151 warehouses, with an average cost of less than 0.58 yuan per 10,000 jin of storage capacity.

    仓库够用吗？
    扬州和湘潭专区群众突击建仓
    本报讯　江苏省扬州专区根据粮食大量增产的情况，社社队队掀起了“腾屋做仓、献料建库”的热潮。在不足一个月的时间内，备好的仓容相当于全省过去两年的粮仓基本建设任务的总和。起初，农民对粮食多了怎么办？未作考虑，好多人认为：“只要收到手，不愁没处放”。当中共扬州地委提出了“丰收余粮三储备（指的国家、农业社、社员统一安排储备），苦战十天备好仓，迎接秋季大丰收”的行动口号以后，群众很快地改变了看法，很短时间内，到处掀起了“备仓”热潮。兴化县安丰乡南万农业社在一个晚会上，群众献出来的建筑材料，就修建好可以容纳七十万斤稻谷的仓库。高邮县汤庄乡联谊农业社的社员，自动把大房屋好房屋腾出来做粮仓，调整了十户住宅，就安排好二十九间仓房。
    在已备的仓库中，有的是在场头新建的土墙草顶仓，花钱很少，每万斤仓容只花六元或七元钱买竹子，有的是农民腾出来的空屋，群众欢迎这种又快又好的方法，兴化县东方农业社、高邮县徐家农业社，都是每个生产队的场头上建了一座土墙草顶仓，又省料，又减少运输上的人力，稻子在场头上晒干了就入库。（梁光景）
    本报讯　今年湖南省湘潭专区将获得全面大丰收，粮食总产量可达一百二十亿斤，农业社除完成国家征购任务及部分社员自管的口粮外，农业社储存的粮食将达五十亿斤左右，而农业社原有仓容不到四亿斤，尚缺仓容四十六亿斤。但是部分乡、社干部有盲目乐观情绪，认为只要有粮食，不愁无处放；全区粮食局、粮管站及时将上述思想情况向党委作了汇报，在党委的统一安排下，大部分县都成立了专门机构，党委亲自挂帅，动员全县农民积极动手修建仓库，迎接大丰收。攸县太平社党支部提出了“社社有总仓，队队有分仓，种子有专仓”的要求，十天内即建成一批能容粮食八十五万斤的仓库。
    湘潭专区在帮助农业社解决缺仓问题时，认真贯彻了多快好省的精神。一开始即提出“以改建、扩建为主，新建为辅；因地制宜，就地取材，废物利用”的原则。全区绝大部分仓库都是利用民房改建的，一般花钱很少。如长沙县江背粮管站帮助五十六个农业社改进、新建仓库一百五十一栋，平均每万斤仓容花钱不到0.58元。
