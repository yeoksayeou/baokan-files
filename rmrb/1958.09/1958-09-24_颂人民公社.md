    Ode to the People's Commune
  　Tian Jian
    Ode to the Garden Commune
    The south mountain has treasures,
    The fruit below the south mountain is good;
    The east of Sichuan has big ships,
    The west of Sichuan has rice;
    One side is Flower and Fruit Mountain,
    The other side is Guanting Lake;
    Over a hundred li in radius,
    All are roads walked by the commune.
    High mountains and lakes shake hands,
    Apples and gemstones nod and smile.
    August 31st, written in the Garden Commune

    Ode to Rockets
    Eighteen thousand people chase rockets,
    The rocket is the great commune. (Note)
    Sit on the rocket to enter paradise,
    One day is better than twenty years. (Note)
    Huailai County, with eighteen thousand people, established
      Six major communes.

    Ode to the People's Commune
    The People's Commune is a red star,
    Each member is all-powerful—
    Pick up a hoe and you're a farmer,
    Pick up a hammer and you're a worker,
    Pick up a gun and you're a soldier,
    Pick up a pen and you're a poet.
    The hoe subdues the drought demon,
    The pen shakes the gods.

    Thousand-Person Assembly
    A thousand-person assembly, ten thousand poems,
    New poems come from the great commune.
    A thousand people, two thousand hands,
    Hold the commune to the edge of the sky.
    A thousand people, two thousand hands,
    Hold poetry up to the blue sky.
    New poems come from the hands of farmers,
    Poems fill the walls, fruits fill the gardens.
    Tens of thousands of households connected as one,
    Members rise to another level of heaven.

    颂人民公社
  　田间
    花园公社赞南山上有珍宝，南山下果子好；川东头有大船，川西头有水稻；一边是花果山，一边是官厅湖；方圆一百多里地，都是公社走的道。高山湖水相握手，苹果宝石点头笑。8月31日，写于花园公社
    火箭颂十八万人赶火箭，火箭就是大公社。（注）坐上火箭进乐园，一天胜过二十年。（注）怀来全县十八万人，成立
      六大公社。
    颂人民公社人民公社是红星，每个社员有万能——拿起锄头是农民，拿起铁锤是工人，拿起枪杆是士兵，拿起笔杆是诗人。锄头降伏了旱魔，笔杆震动了天神。
    千人大会千人大会诗万篇，新诗出在大公社。一千人，手双千，托着公社到天边。一千人，手双千，托着诗歌上青天。新诗出在庄稼手，诗满墙头果满园。千万万户连成一片，社员又上一层天。
