Xinhua News Agency, 14th: As world opinion and the American people increasingly express strong dissatisfaction with the U.S. government's continued war provocations in the Taiwan Strait area, U.S. President Eisenhower delivered a television speech to the nation on the 11th regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait area. In this speech, which he called an explanation of the "basic facts" of the region, Eisenhower went to great lengths to distort the truth, slandering the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory as "aggression," and portraying the United States' towering crimes of aggression against Chinese territory and threats to peace in the Far East and the world as "always enthusiastically committed to glorious peace." Eisenhower also reiterated Dulles' statement on September 4, threatening to expand American aggression against China in the region and issuing blatant war threats to the Chinese people. Eisenhower tried his best to induce the American people to support the U.S. government's war adventure policy. The full text of Eisenhower's speech is as follows:

My friends: Tonight I want to talk to you about the peace-endangering situation in the Formosa (Taiwan) Strait in the Far East. My purpose is to explain to you the basic facts of this situation, and then to explain the conclusions I have reached on the issue of our country's appropriate course of action.

First, let us recall that, traditionally, our country and its government have always been enthusiastically committed to glorious peace, just as they are now. We never use force to resolve differences, unless we have to do so to resist aggression and protect our vital interests.

This means that, in our view, negotiations and reconciliation should never be abandoned in favor of force and conflict. Although we will never cowardly retreat in the face of the threat of armed aggression, we welcome negotiations in the current situation that can achieve results in maintaining peace in the Formosa region and reaching a solution acceptable to all parties concerned, which of course includes our ally, the Republic of China.

On the morning of August 23, the Chinese Communists launched a fierce bombardment of Jinmen—an island in the Formosa Strait near the Chinese coast. Another island in the area, Mazu, was also attacked. Both islands have always been part of Free China—and have never been under Communist control.

Since then, the bombardment of Jinmen has been almost constant. The Chinese Communists have also been using their naval vessels to try to disrupt the supply to Jinmen, which is inhabited by 125,000 people. Their normal supply is provided by sea from Formosa, where the Free Chinese government is now located.

The Chinese Communists say they must occupy Jinmen. So far, they have not actually attempted to land, but their bombardment has caused great damage. More than a thousand people have been killed or injured, a large proportion of whom are civilians.

This is a tragic thing. It is shocking that in this day and age, some people are using naked force to achieve such aggressive purposes.

But this is not the first time the Chinese Communists have taken such action.

In 1950, they attacked and attempted to conquer the Republic of Korea. At that time, President Truman announced that the United States intended to protect Formosa—a major area still occupied by Free China—because he believed that the security of Formosa was extremely important to the security of the United States and the free world. Since 1950, our government has steadfastly adhered to this policy.

In 1953 and 1954, the Chinese Communists actively participated in the war in Indochina against Vietnam.

In the autumn of 1954, they attacked Jinmen and Mazu, the two islands they are attacking now. In January 1955, they stopped this attack when Congress and I agreed that we should firmly support Free China.

Since then, for almost four years, the Chinese Communists have not used force to achieve aggressive purposes. We achieved an armistice in Korea in 1953, which stopped the fighting. An armistice was achieved in Vietnam in 1954. Since 1955, the Formosa Strait area has been calm. We had hoped that the Chinese Communists would become peaceful people—but it seems that is not the case.

Therefore, the world is once again faced with the problem of armed aggression. A powerful dictatorship is attacking an exposed but free area.

What should we do?

Should we think that it is best to succumb to threats and hand over pieces of free territory to others in order to satisfy the aggressor's desires, so that we can have peace?

Don't we still remember that the name "Munich" symbolizes the idea that it is futile to try to satisfy dictators by means of appeasement?

At that time, a policy of appeasement was tried, and it failed. Before World War II, Mussolini seized Ethiopia. In the Far East, Japanese warlords were using force to seize Manchuria. Hitler violated the Treaty of Versailles, sending his armed forces to the Rhineland, and then he annexed little Austria. After he succeeded, he then turned to Czechoslovakia, eating it away little by little.

In the face of all these attacks on freedom by dictators, powerful nation-states stood aside. At the time, it seemed that Ethiopia and Manchuria were too far away and too unimportant to be worth fighting for. In Europe, appeasement was considered the road to peace. The democratic countries felt that if they tried to stop what was happening, it would mean war. But because of these repeated retreats, war still came.

If the democratic countries had taken a firm stance at the beginning, it is almost certain that World War II would not have happened. But they showed weakness and timidity, which encouraged aggressive rulers to conquer other countries one by one. Finally, the democratic countries saw that their survival was in danger. They had no choice but to stand up and fight, and that war proved to be the most terrible war the world had ever had.

I know something about that war, and I never want to see that history repeated. But, my American compatriots, if peace-loving democratic countries once again fearfully pursue such a policy, that is, stand idly by while great aggressors use force to conquer small countries, then that history will certainly be repeated.

Let us assume that the Chinese Communists conquer Jinmen. Will things stop there? We know that things will not stop there. History teaches us that when powerful tyrants can gain something through aggression, they will try to gain more and more things in the same way.

In addition, we have more than just historical lessons to guide us. We have the Chinese Communists' own statements and boasts. They blatantly say that their current military efforts are part of a plan to conquer Formosa.

It is quite certain that the purpose of the Chinese Communists' shooting that began on August 23 is not just to occupy Jinmen Island. It is part of an ambitious plan that does indeed involve armed conquest.

This plan is to eliminate all positions of the free world in the Western Pacific region and bring them under the control of enslaved governments that are hostile to the United States and the free world. In this way, the Chinese and Russian Communists could at least rule the western half of the Pacific, which is now friendly.

Therefore, the aggression carried out by cruel tyrants has once again created a clear danger to the United States and to the free world.

In this effort, the Chinese Communists and the Soviet Union seem to be closely cooperating. This past Monday, I received a long letter from Premier Khrushchev on this issue. He warned the United States not to help its allies in the Western Pacific. He said that we should not support the Republic of China and the Republic of Korea. He said that we should abandon them, withdraw all our naval forces to our domestic bases, and let our friends in the Far East deal alone with the combined military forces of the Soviet Union and Communist China.

Does Mr. Khrushchev think that we have forgotten the Korean War so quickly?

Friends: I cannot help but tell you very frankly and seriously that the United States cannot accept the kind of result that the Communists are seeking. Now, we cannot show weakness either—cowardice—if we do, they will surely attack us and our friends in the Western Pacific region even more aggressively.

If the Chinese Communists have decided to risk a war, it is not because Jinmen itself is so valuable to them. They have lived without Jinmen ever since they seized the Chinese mainland nine years ago.

If they now decide to risk war, it can only be because they and their Soviet allies have decided to explore whether threatening war is a policy that they can use to gain great benefits.

If that is their decision, then another Munich in the Western Pacific will not buy us peace or security. Doing so would encourage the aggressor and discourage our friends and allies there. If history teaches anything, it is that appeasement makes a major war more likely.

Congress has shown that it recognizes that the security of the Western Pacific is extremely important to the security of the United States, and that we should take a firm stance. The Senate, by an overwhelming majority, approved the security treaty with the Republic of China regarding the security of Formosa and the Pescadores Islands (Penghu Islands) and the security treaty with the Republic of Korea. We have a mutual security treaty with the Republic of the Philippines, which could be the next target of conquest if Formosa falls into enemy hands. These treaties obligate the United States to defend these treaty areas. In addition, in January 1955, Congress passed a joint resolution specifically regarding Formosa and Free China's coastal islands in the Formosa Strait.

The situation at that time was similar to the situation today.

At that time, Congress authorized the President to use the armed forces of the United States not only to defend Formosa, but also to defend related positions such as Jinmen and Mazu, if I thought defending them was appropriate to ensure the security of Formosa.

I can add that Congress granted this power with an almost bipartisan vote.

Today, the Chinese Communists have repeatedly and officially declared that their military operations against Jinmen are a preparatory step for attacking Formosa. Therefore, it is very clear that the 1955 resolution on the Formosa Strait applies to the current situation.

If the current bombardment and harassment of Jinmen turns into a major offensive that the local garrison cannot cope with, then we will have to face precisely the situation that Congress envisioned in 1955.

I have repeatedly tried to explain our position on this issue in order to avoid the danger of the Communists making a miscalculation. The Secretary of State issued a statement on September 4 for the same purpose. This statement, of course, cannot list every possible situation. Indeed, I believe that the joint resolution requires me not to make absolute promises in advance, but to make judgments based on the circumstances at the time. But this statement is indeed very clear to the Chinese Communists and the Soviet Union. We will never retreat in the face of this armed aggression, which constitutes an important part of a long-term plan to conquer new areas using armed forces.

I do not believe that the United States can be induced or intimidated into adopting a policy of appeasement. I believe that in taking a stand against aggression by force, I am taking the only position that is in the vital interests of the United States and indeed in the interests of world peace.

Some misguided people say that it is not worth getting excited about Jinmen. They have said the same thing about South Korea—about Vietnam, about Lebanon.

Now, I assure you that I will never ask any American man to fight just for Jinmen. But the members of our armed forces—and, I believe, the entire American people—are indeed ready to defend the principle that force must not be used to achieve aggressive purposes.

Whether we can achieve lasting and just peace depends on whether this principle is observed. It is this principle that protects the security of our country and the positions of the free world in the Western Pacific. If we are not prepared to defend this principle, then one tragedy after another will befall us.

But, to resolve these differences, there is a much better path than resorting to force, and there is some hope that we can take such a better path.

This is the path of negotiation.

This path is open and ready, because in 1955, the United States and the Chinese Communists made arrangements stipulating that each party authorized one of its ambassadors to discuss certain issues of common concern in Geneva. These issues included the release of American civilians detained in Communist China, and the declaration of renunciation of force in the Formosa region. Since August 1955, seventy-three meetings have been held.

When our ambassador, who had been conducting these talks, was recently reassigned, we appointed our ambassador to Poland, Mr. Beam, to succeed him. We therefore notified the Chinese Communists in the second half of July, but received no response.

The Secretary of State mentioned this Geneva talk in his statement on September 4. Two days later, Mr. Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, suggested resuming the talks "for the sake of peace." On September 8, Mr. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, also expressed something. We immediately welcomed this prospect and instructed our ambassador to Warsaw to prepare to resume these talks immediately. We hope that the talks will begin after the Chinese Communist ambassador, who has been in Beijing, returns to Warsaw.

Perhaps our suggestion will produce results. We sincerely hope so.

Naturally, the United States will adhere to the attitude it originally adopted in 1955, that is, in these talks, we will never participate in any arrangement that would harm the rights of our ally, the Republic of China.

We know from bitter experience that the Chinese Communist leaders are indeed warlike and aggressive. But we cannot believe that they are now determined to implement a policy of military aggression, which would threaten world peace and bring all the consequences. We believe that a way out can and should be found through diplomatic means. Some measures can be taken to ensure that these coastal islands are not something that endangers peace. We believe that it is urgent to make arrangements to stop the shelling and pave the way for a peaceful resolution.

If the talks between the two ambassadors cannot be completely successful, there is still hope that the United Nations can exert a peaceful influence on the situation.

In 1955, the Chinese Communists' hostile actions in the Formosa Strait were submitted to the United Nations Security Council. But the Chinese Communists believed that the Council had no jurisdiction. They said that they had the right to obtain Formosa and the coastal islands, and that if they used force to obtain them, it was purely a "civil war," and that the United Nations had no right to intervene in this matter.

They also said that the Communist North Korea's attack on South Korea was a "civil war," and that the United Nations and the United States were "aggressors" because they helped South Korea. They said the same thing about their attack on Vietnam.

I am sure that these excuses cannot deceive or control world opinion, and the fact is that Communist China's hostile actions in the Taiwan Strait do endanger world peace. I do not believe that any ruler—no matter how aggressive they may be—would ridicule efforts to seek a glorious and peaceful solution, whether through direct negotiations or through the United Nations.

My friends, we are facing a serious situation. But this is typical of the security problems in the world today. Powerful and aggressive forces constantly probe here and there to see if the free world is weakening. In the face of such a situation, there are no easy choices, and anyone who suggests that there are such choices is wrong.

But, the current situation, although serious, is by no means hopeless or hopeless.

There will be no appeasement.

I believe there will be no war.

But, the American people must be soberly aware that our just cause is once again being tested by those who threaten peace and freedom everywhere.

This is not the first test we and the free world have faced. It probably won't be the last test either. But, as we bravely and unitedly meet each test, we will contribute to the security and glory of our beloved country—and to the cause of justice and lasting peace.

    妄图掩饰侵略罪行摆脱孤立处境
    艾森豪威尔向全世界进行欺骗恫吓
    新华社14日讯　由于全世界舆论和美国人民对美国政府在台湾海峡地区继续进行战争挑衅越来越表示强烈的不满，美国总统艾森豪威尔在11日就台湾海峡地区的局势向全国发表了一篇电视演说。在他自称为是说明这个地区的“基本事实”的这篇演说里，艾森豪威尔极尽颠倒黑白的能事，诬蔑中国人民解放自己领土是“进行侵略”，把美国侵略中国领土、威胁远东和世界和平的滔天罪行说成是“一向热情地致力于光荣的和平”。艾森豪威尔还重申杜勒斯在9月4日的声明，扬言美国要扩大在这个地区对中国的侵略，向中国人民发出露骨的战争威胁。艾森豪威尔竭力诱骗美国人民支持美国政府的战争冒险政策。艾森豪威尔的演说全文如下：
    我的朋友们：今天晚上我想同你们谈谈在远东福摩萨（台湾）海峡发生的危及和平的局势。我的目的是向你们说明这个局势的基本事实，其次再说明我就我国的适当行动方针问题得出的结论。
    首先让我们回想一下，在传统上我们国家和它的政府一向是热情地致力于光荣的和平的，就像它们现在所做的一样。我们决不使用武力来解决分歧，除非为了抵抗侵略和保护我们的切身利益而不得不这样做。
    这意味着，照我们看来，决不应当放弃谈判和和解而代之以武力和冲突。虽然我们决不在武装侵略的威胁面前怯懦地退却，我们在目前的情况下欢迎能够在维护福摩萨地区的和平和达成可以为一切有关方面所接受的解决办法方面取得成果的谈判，有关方面当然包括我们的盟友中华民国。
    在8月23日上午，中国共产党人猛烈轰击金门——中国海岸附近福摩萨海峡中的一个岛屿。这个地区的另一个岛屿马祖也受到攻击。这两个岛屿一直是自由中国的一部分——从来没有处在共产党控制之下。
    自从那时以来，对于金门的轰击差不多一直不断地进行着。中国共产党还一直使用它们的海军舰只来设法破坏对住有十二万五千人的金门的供应。他们的正常供应是从海路从福摩萨提供的，自由中国政府现在就设在福摩萨。
    中国共产党人说，他们一定要占领金门。到现在为止，他们还没有实际企图登陆，可是他们的轰击造成了很大的破坏。死伤了一千多人，很大一部分是平民。
    这是一件悲惨的事情。令人震惊的是，在现在这个时代，竟有人利用赤裸裸的武力来达到这种侵略目的。
    但是中国共产党人采取这样的行动这并不是第一次。
    在1950年，他们攻击并企图征服大韩民国。当时杜鲁门总统宣布美国打算保护福摩萨——仍由自由中国占据的一个主要地区，因为相信福摩萨的安全对于美国和自由世界的安全是极其重要的。自从1950年以来，我国政府一直坚定地遵守这种政策。
    在1953年和1954年，中国共产党人积极参加了在印度支那的反对越南的战争。
    在1954年秋天，他们攻击了金门和马祖，这就是他们现在正在攻击的那两个岛屿。在1955年1月，国会和我一致认为我们应当坚决支持自由中国的时候，他们停止了这种攻击。
    自从那时以来，差不多有四年，中国共产党人并没有使用武力来达到侵略目的。我们1953年在朝鲜实现了停战，从而使战斗停了下来。1954年在越南实现了停战。自从1955年以来，福摩萨海峡地区一直是平静的。我们曾经希望中国共产党人会成为和平的人——但是看来并不是这样。
    因此，世界再一次面临武装侵略的问题。强有力的独裁政权正在攻击一个暴露的但却是自由的地区。
    我们应该作些什么呢？
    难道我们应当认为，最好向威胁屈服，把一块一块的自由领土交给别人，以便满足侵略者的欲望，我们就可以有和平吗？
    我们不是还记得“慕尼黑”的名字象征着希望用姑息的办法满足独裁者是白费心机的念头吗？
    那时候，曾经试过姑息政策，结果失败了。在第二次世界大战以前，墨索里尼攫取了埃塞俄比亚。在远东，日本军阀在用武力夺取满洲。希特勒破坏凡尔赛条约，派遣他的武装部队到莱因兰去，然后他又吞并了小小的奥地利。在他得逞以后，他接着就转向捷克斯洛伐克，一点一点地吃掉它。
    在独裁者对自由的这一切的进攻面前，强大的民族国家站在一边。当时看起来，埃塞俄比亚和满洲是太遥远了，太不重要了，不值得为之一战。在欧洲，姑息被认为是走向和平的道路。民主国家觉得，如果它们设法制止当时正在进行的事情，那就意味着战争。但是，由于这些一再的退却，战争还是到来了。
    如果民主国家开头就采取坚决的态度，差不多可以肯定，本来是不会发生世界大战的。可是它们表现出懦弱和胆怯的样子，因而使侵略成性的统治者受到了鼓励，把别的国家一个一个加以征服。最后民主国家看到它们的生存处在危险之中。它们没有其他办法，只好挺身而战，而那次战争证明是世界所有过的最恐怖的战争。
    我对那次战争有所了解，我决不想看到那段历史重演。可是，我的美国同胞们，如果爱好和平的民主国家再次害怕地奉行这样一种政策，那就是在大侵略者使用武力征服弱小国家的时候袖手旁观，那么那段历史肯定会重演。
    让我们假定中国共产党人征服了金门。事情会到此为止吗？我们知道，事情不会到此为止。历史教导我们，当强有力的暴君能够通过侵略获得一些东西的时候，他们将试图用同样的方法获得更多更多的东西。
    此外，我们还有比历史教训更多的东西引导我们。我们有中国共产党人自己的声明和吹嘘。他们露骨地说，他们目前的军事努力是征服福摩萨的计划的一部分。
    十分肯定，中国共产党人在8月23日开始的射击的目的不仅是要占领金门岛。它是一项的确是要武装征服的野心计划的一部分。
    这个计划是要消除自由世界在西太平洋地区的一切阵地，使它们处于敌视美国和自由世界的被奴役的政府的控制之下。这样中国和俄国共产党人就至少可以统治现在是友好的太平洋的西半部。
    因此，残忍的暴君进行的侵略再次造成了一种威胁到美国和对自由世界的清楚的危险。
    在这种努力中，中国共产党人和苏联看来是密切合作的。在本星期一，我收到了赫鲁晓夫总理关于这个问题的一封长信。他警告美国不要帮助它在西太平洋的盟国。他说，我们不应支持中华民国和大韩民国。他说，我们应当抛弃它们，把我们的全部海军部队撤回我们的国内基地，让我们在远东的朋友们单独应付苏联和共产党中国的联合军事力量。
    难道赫鲁晓夫先生认为，我们这样快就忘掉了朝鲜事件吗？
    朋友们：我不能不非常坦率而严肃地告诉你们，美国无法接受共产党人所寻求的那种结果。现在，我们也不能够表现得意志薄弱——怯懦——要是这样，他们肯定会更加气势汹汹地向我们和我们在西太平洋地区的朋友们进攻。
    如果中国共产党人已经决定冒进行一次战争的危险，那不是因为金门本身对他们那样有价值。他们自从九年前攫取了中国大陆以来，一直没有金门也过下来了。
    如果他们现在决定冒战争的危险，那只能是因为他们和他们的苏联盟友已经决定要探明，以战争相威胁是不是一种他们可以借以取得很大利益的政策。
    如果他们的决定就是这样，那么，来一次西太平洋的慕尼黑事件，也不会为我们换得和平或安全。这样做会鼓励侵略者，会使我们在那里的朋友和盟国感到沮丧。如果说历史给人什么教训的话，那就是姑息会使我们不得不进行一次大战的可能性更大。
    国会已经表明，它认识到西太平洋的安全对于美国的安全是极其重要的，并且认识到我们应当采取坚定态度。参议院以压倒多数的票数，批准了同中华民国缔结的关于福摩萨和佩斯卡多尔列岛（澎湖列岛）的安全条约以及同大韩民国缔结的安全条约。我们同菲律宾共和国缔有共同安全条约，如果福摩萨落入敌人的手中，菲律宾共和国就可能是下一个被征服的对象。这些条约使美国有义务保卫这些条约地区。此外，国会还在1955年1月通过了一项联合决议，这项决议是特别关于福摩萨和自由中国在福摩萨海峡的沿海岛屿的。
    当时的情况同今天的情况相似。
    那时国会授权总统使用美国的武装力量不仅保卫福摩萨，并且保卫像金门、马祖这样的有关阵地，如果我认为保卫它们对于确保福摩萨是适当的话。
    我可以补充说，国会差不多是以两党一致的表决结果授予这个权力的。
    今天，中国共产党人一再地正式宣布，他们对金门的军事行动是进攻福摩萨的预备步骤。因此十分清楚，1955年的关于福摩萨海峡的决议适用于目前的局势。
    如果目前对金门的轰击和骚扰转变成为当地守军无法应付的大进攻，那末我们就不得不恰恰面临国会在1955年所设想的局势。
    我曾经一再企图说明我们在这个问题上的立场，以免发生共产党作出错误估计的危险。国务卿为了同样的目的在9月4日发表了声明。这个声明当然不能列举每一种可能发生的情况。的确我认为联合决议要求我事先不作出绝对的诺言，而根据当时的情况作出判断。但是这个声明对中国共产党人和苏联来说意义的确是很清楚的。面对着在利用武装部队征服新地区的长久计划中构成重要部分的这种武装侵略，决不会后退。
    我不相信美国会能受诱骗或恐吓而采取姑息态度。我相信在采取用武力反对侵略的立场的时候，我所采取的是唯一符合于美国切身利益而且的确也是符合于世界和平的立场。
    有些受迷惑的人说，不值得为金门而激动。关于南朝鲜——关于越南、关于黎巴嫩，他们也说过这样的话。
    现在，我向你们保证，我决不会要求任何美国男儿仅仅为金门而战。但是，我们的武装部队的成员——而且，我相信是全体美国人民——的确都随时准备保卫不得使用武力来达到侵略目的这一原则。
    能否得到持久和正义的和平，就取决于这个原则是否得到遵守。保护着我们祖国的安全和保护着西太平洋自由世界的阵地的就是这个原则。如果我们不准备保卫这一原则，那么，一个又一个的悲剧会落到我们身上。
    但是，要解决这些分歧，除了诉诸武力以外，还有一条好得多的道路，而且，有某种希望可以走这样一个比较好的道路。
    这就是谈判的道路。
    这条道路是畅通的和准备好了的，因为在1955年，美国和中国共产党人作了安排，规定每一方授权自己的一位大使在日内瓦讨论某些共同有关的问题。这些问题包括释放被拘禁在共产党中国的美国平民问题，以及在福摩萨地区宣布放弃武力等问题。自从1955年8月以来，举行过七十三次会议。
    当一直进行这种会谈的我们的大使最近另调他职的时候，我们任命我们驻波兰大使比姆先生继任。我们因此在7月下半月通知了中国共产党人，但是没有得到回答。
    国务卿在9月4日发表的声明中提到这个日内瓦会谈。两天以后，中华人民共和国总理周恩来先生建议“为了和平的利益”恢复这个会谈。9月8日，中华人民共和国主席毛泽东先生接着也有所表示。我们立即表示欢迎这个前景，并且指示我们驻华沙大使准备立即恢复这种会谈。我们希望会谈在一直在北平的中国共产党大使返回华沙后就开始。
    或许我们的建议会产生结果。我们热诚地希望会这样。
    自然，美国将坚持它最初在1955年所采取的态度，那就是，在这种会谈中，我们决不参与会损害我们的盟邦中华民国的权利的任何安排。
    我们从严酷的经验中知道，中国共产党领袖们的确是好战的和具有侵略性的。但是我们不能相信他们现在会坚决执行军事侵略的方针，这种方针会威胁世界和平和带来一切后果。我们认为，用外交手段，能够而且应该找到一个出路。可以采取一些措施保证这些沿海岛屿不会是危害和平的东西。我们认为，迫切需要作出安排，以使炮火停止，并且为和平解决铺平道路。
    如果双方大使之间的会谈不能完全成功，仍然有希望使联合国对这个局势发挥和平的影响。
    在1955年，中国共产党人在福摩萨海峡的敌对行动被提交到联合国安全理事会。但是中国共产党人认为理事会无权管辖。他们说，他们有权得到福摩萨和沿海岛屿，并且说，如果他们使用武力来取得它们，这纯粹是“内战”，并且说，联合国无权干预这件事。
    他们还说，共产党北朝鲜对南朝鲜的攻击是“内战”，联合国和美国是“侵略者”，因为它们帮助南朝鲜。关于他们对越南的进攻，他们也是这样说的。
    我确信这些借口欺骗不了也控制不了世界舆论，事实是，共产党中国在台湾海峡的敌对行动的确危害了世界和平。我并不相信任何统治者——不管他们具有怎样的侵略性——会嘲弄不管是通过直接谈判还是通过联合国寻求光荣的和和平的解决办法的努力。
    我的朋友们，我们面临着一个严重的局势。但是这是今天世界安全问题的典型。强有力的和具有侵略性的力量经常地时而在这里时而在那里进行试探，看看自由世界是否在削弱，在面临这种局势的情况下，没有容易的抉择，任何人如果暗示有这样的抉择，那是错误的。
    但是，目前的局势，虽然严重，却决不是无可救药的，或者毫无希望的。
    不会有任何姑息。
    我相信不会有任何战争。
    但是，美国人民必须清醒地认识到，我们的正当的目的正在再一次由于那些威胁各地的和平和自由的人们而受到考验。
    这不是我们和自由世界受到的第一次考验。大概这也不会是最后一次考验。但是，随着我们勇敢地团结一致地应付每一次考验，我们就对我们可爱的国家的安全和光荣——以及正义和持久的和平的事业——作出贡献。
