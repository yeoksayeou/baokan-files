Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Today, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a "Beijing Sanitation Work Leap Forward Swearing-in Meeting" with the participation of over 40,000 people. Participants included representatives from street residents, government offices, military units, factories, mines, construction sites, schools, and medical units, as well as sanitation work activists. The meeting proposed that on the basis of the great achievements already made in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene in Beijing, sanitation work should be pushed to a new high tide, demanding the resolute, thorough, clean, and complete elimination of mosquitoes and flies, to greet National Day in a clean and tidy manner.

At the meeting, Wan Li, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee and Deputy Mayor, and Yang Shu, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee, both made reports. They proposed that starting from the 11th, all districts, systems, and units in the city should adopt the organizational form used in the encirclement and suppression of sparrows, taking a fighting posture, mobilizing the entire population, and working hard for four days to vigorously swat and trap mosquitoes and flies. Starting at 4:30 AM on the 11th, the urban area and the surrounding areas would act in unison, simultaneously conducting outdoor fumigation with "666" pesticide, spraying pesticides during the day, and conducting indoor fumigation in all households at 7:00 PM. The suburbs will conduct indoor and outdoor fumigation on the 14th.

This concentrated campaign also requires the elimination of mosquito and fly breeding conditions. Toilets in urban and suburban areas are required to be leak-proof, not attracting flies and breeding maggots. Toilets that have not been renovated must be renovated before "October 1st." Toilets must achieve "four haves" (have fly swatters, have brooms, have pit covers, have clean soil or 666 powder, furnace ash, lime), and "two covers" (cover with clean soil after defecation, cover the pit). Garbage should be cleared in a timely manner, ensuring that garbage bins are sent and retrieved on time. In rural areas, the widespread promotion of mud-sealing composting should be combined with fertilizer accumulation, and sanitary management should be strengthened. Manure pools must be completely sealed. Livestock sheds, pig pens, and poultry farms must achieve "three diligences" (diligence in rising, diligence in padding, diligence in cleaning). All general-purpose vehicles should carry fly swatters and brooms. Every household should do a good job of turning over pots and overturning cans, plugging tree holes, and clearing accumulated water after rain in a timely manner.

At the meeting, the secretaries of the thirteen urban and suburban district committees, representing their respective districts, put forward challenges and responses on the spot, expressing their determination to do a good job in sanitation work. They also put forward specific measures.
