False History and True History
    Dong Fengya

    Eisenhower's speech used a large section to talk about the so-called lessons of history. He talked about the Munich policy before World War II, saying that "if the democracies (this is the Americans' self-praise of themselves and their partners) had adopted a firm attitude from the beginning, it is almost certain that there would have been no world war."
    World War II was indeed a major lesson in human history. People of the world often use the example of "Munich" to warn those who cultivate the German Nazi gang and the Japanese militarist forces, asking them to remember the lesson of "lifting a rock to drop it on one's own feet." So, now that Eisenhower specifically talks about the historical lessons of "Munich" in his speech, has he accepted this lesson?
    No. On the contrary, today's American aggressors need "Munich" more than ever. Because, firstly, it is people like Eisenhower and Dulles who are personally restoring and cultivating the Nazi forces in West Germany and the militarist forces in Japan, the purpose of which is still the same as before, hoping to use them as hounds to invade socialist countries. Predictably, the result may still be unavoidable, "dropping the rock on one's own feet." Secondly, today's American aggressors have replaced Nazi Germany and militarist Japan and have become the culprits in launching wars of aggression. Compared with the strength of the people of the world, today's Eisenhowers clearly don't have Hitler's strength, but their hands are stretched out even further than Hitler's. Hitler, until his death, was unable to extend his hand to the Far East, but the American aggressors' clutches have reached Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. However, this hand is so weak that it can be cut off at any time. Precisely because of this, American aggressors particularly need "Munich." Now, the reason why Eisenhower wants to talk specifically about the lessons of "Munich," besides wanting to use this well-known historical fact to slander the great Chinese people, is precisely to find a pleasant excuse for himself to expand his aggression in the Far East, so that he can start to gather a group to help him carry out aggression. This is the so-called "getting the support of allies."
    It is particularly ridiculous for the head of a major Western power to come out and play with this kind of self-deceiving trick, and think that this is "using the personal prestige of the president." Only the servants of the United States feel that the "personal prestige" of the American president is more important than their own lives. Slightly smarter people are unwilling to fall for his trap, because the matter is clearly laid out there: the era of "Munich" is completely dead. At least fifteen countries have experienced "life" on the Korean battlefield. Who else is willing to put their neck in the death trap again? As for the people of the world, they will not be arbitrarily fooled by Eisenhower. Today, no one believes that the Chinese people liberating their own territory occupied by others is the same as Hitler robbing other people's territory everywhere.
    What is the real historical lesson of World War II? The ambitionists of Britain, France, and the United States playing the "Munich" trick and "dropping the rock on their own feet" is only one aspect of the historical lesson; in this regard, these ambitionists have always owed a debt to the people of the world. But the historical lesson also has a more important aspect. At that time, the socialist forces were very lonely. At that time, the west wind was still stronger than the east wind, and the strength of the people of the world was not enough to contain the outbreak of an imperialist war. The strength of the people was only fully mobilized during the war, and the result was the elimination of fascist Germany and militarist Japan. A powerful socialist camp appeared in the world, a universal upsurge of national liberation movements emerged, and a great unity of world peace forces appeared. In a word, a new situation of the east wind prevailing over the west wind was formed, burying the era in which imperialism could run rampant at will.
    Therefore, it can be said that World War II has its historical inevitability, which is an inevitable process in the development of human history. The struggle of imperialism resulted in the outbreak of war, which caused the people to suffer great sacrifices. This is a bad thing; however, since then, a powerful socialist camp has emerged, and a good situation of the east wind prevailing over the west wind has appeared, which is a good thing. Now, all kinds of people can draw profound lessons from it. For the people of the world, the lesson is that as long as they are fully mobilized, no matter how ferocious the enemy is, they can be completely eliminated; for the imperialists, the lesson should be that no matter how ferocious it is, as long as it launches a war, it will inevitably be eliminated by the people. "If the imperialist war maniacs dare to impose war on the people, then all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and peoples will surely unite closely, thoroughly eliminate the imperialist aggressors, and lay the foundation for lasting world peace." (Communique of the meeting between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev) This is the ultimate truth. As for the so-called "historical lessons" talked about by Eisenhower, they are nothing but a dying man's attempt to struggle, a drug used to deceive others and oneself.

    假历史与真历史
    董逢亚
    艾森豪威尔的演说，用了很大一段话，来谈所谓历史的教训。他谈到了第二次世界大战前的慕尼黑政策，说是“如果民主国家（这是美国佬对自己以及它的伙伴的自我称颂）开头就采取坚决的态度，差不多可以肯定，本来是不会发生世界大战的。”
    第二次世界大战，的确是人类历史上的一大教训。世界人民，也常常用“慕尼黑”的例子，来告诫那些培植德国纳粹匪帮和日本军国主义势力的人，要他们记住以前“搬起石头砸自己脚”的教训。那末，现在艾森豪威尔特意在演说中大谈“慕尼黑”的历史教训，是否已经接受了这教训了呢？
    不是的。恰恰相反，今天的美国侵略者，比以往任何时候，更加需要“慕尼黑”。因为第一，正是艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之流的人，在亲手恢复和培植西德的纳粹势力和日本的军国主义势力，其目的仍然像以前那次一样，幻想用他们充作自己侵略社会主义国家的鹰犬。可以预料，这结果怕仍是免不了“砸自己的脚”。还有第二，今天美国侵略者已经代替了当年的纳粹德国和军国主义的日本，成了发动侵略战争的罪魁。同世界人民的力量对比来看，今日的艾森豪威尔之流的人，力气显然没有当年希特勒的大，而手却比希特勒还伸得长。希特勒至死，手还没有能够伸到远东来，而美国侵略者的魔手却是欧、亚、非、美四大洲都伸到了的。但是，这手是如此的无力，随时都能被别人砍断。也就为了这，美国侵略者才特别需要“慕尼黑”。现在艾森豪威尔所以要特别大谈“慕尼黑”的教训，除了想利用人所共知的这个历史事实来诬蔑伟大的中国人民以外，正是想替自己扩大在远东的侵略，找一个动听的借口，以便他着手来纠合一个帮他进行侵略的集团。这就是所谓的“取得盟国的支持”。
    以一个西方大国元首的身份，出来玩弄这种自欺欺人的小伎俩，并自以为这是在“利用总统个人的威望”，是特别好笑的。只有美国的奴仆们才会感到美国总统的“个人威望”比自己的身家性命还重要。稍微聪明一些的人，都不肯上他的圈套，因为事情是明明白白地摆在那里：“慕尼黑”的时代已经彻底死亡了。起码已经有十五个国家，在朝鲜战场上体验过了“生活”。谁还肯再把自己脖子往死套子里钻。至于世界人民，更不会由艾森豪威尔来任意愚弄。今天没有一个人相信：中国人民解放自己被别人霸占的领土，同希特勒到处抢劫别人的领土，会有丝毫相同。
    第二次世界大战的真正的历史教训是什么？英、法、美等国的野心家玩弄“慕尼黑”手段，“搬石头砸了自己的脚”，这只是历史教训的一方面；在这方面这些野心家们一直是对世界人民负有罪债的。但历史的教训还有它更重要的一面。在当时来说，社会主义势力非常孤单，那时还是西风大于东风，世界人民的力量还不足于遏止一次帝国主义大战的爆发。人民的力量是在战争中才充分动员起来的，结果是消灭了法西斯德国和军国主义的日本，世界上出现了强大的社会主义阵营，出现了民族解放运动的普遍高涨，出现了世界和平力量的大团结。一句话，形成了东风压倒西风的新局面。埋葬了帝国主义任意横行的那个时代。
    所以可以这样说：第二次世界大战有它的历史必然性，这是人类历史发展中的一种必然过程。帝国主义角逐的结果爆发了大战，使人民遭受了巨大的牺牲，这是坏事；但是，从此出现了强大的社会主义阵营，出现了东风压倒西风的大好局面，却又是一件好事。现在，各种人都能从中得出深刻的教训。对于世界人民来说，教训就是只要充分动员起来，无论怎样凶恶的敌人都是可以彻底消灭的；对于帝国主义者来说，教训应是，无论它怎样凶恶，只要一旦发动战争，必定要被人民消灭。“如果帝国主义战争狂人竟敢把战争强加在人民头上，那末，所有爱好和平和爱好自由的国家和人民必将紧密地团结在一起，彻底地消灭帝国主义侵略者，奠定世界的永久和平。”（毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫会谈公报）这才是至理名言。至于艾森豪威尔谈论的所谓“历史教训”，只不过是垂死者妄图挣扎，用来欺人而又欺己的迷魂药而已。
