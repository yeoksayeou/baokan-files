Xinhua News Agency, London, September 25th: British Prime Minister Macmillan held a meeting for more than two hours today with a delegation from the British Trades Union Congress, composed of nine union leaders. The General Council of the British Trades Union Congress, which represents eight million organized British workers, issued a statement the day before, demanding that the government make it clear that Britain would never be drawn into a war that the United States might cause to prevent China from liberating the coastal islands. The council's statement also said that the British government has a responsibility to persuade the U.S. government not to wage a war for Jinmen (Quemoy) and Mazu (Matsu).

When Macmillan met with the delegation, he did not clearly state that Britain recognizes the Chinese government's sovereignty over the coastal islands and that Britain would not support the United States' aggressive and provocative policy toward China. He merely said: "The British government is willing to help seek a solution to the Formosa (Taiwan) dispute through diplomatic negotiations."

Macmillan did not directly answer the strong demand of the Trades Union Congress delegation—that the British people would never allow themselves to be drawn into a war that could become much wider. He only said that the British government's policy is: "The entire international community should unanimously insist on not using force to resolve the dispute in the Taiwan area." As everyone knows, the United States is trying its best to play the trick of "not using force" and "ceasefire" in an attempt to legalize its aggressive acts and prevent the Chinese people from liberating their own territory. Macmillan here is clearly supporting the United States' argument of interfering in China's internal affairs, and he has completely failed to meet the British public's demand to draw a line between themselves and the United States' policy of aggression and playing with fire.

Macmillan said that he supports the idea of resolving the issue through negotiations, and he said that China and the United States are continuing negotiations in Warsaw, "and it does not seem that discussions in any other forum would help solve the problem at present."

The statement agreed upon by Macmillan and the delegation after the meeting stated that Macmillan reiterated to the delegation what he had said in his letter to Labour Party leader Gaitskell: "Our American allies have neither sought to ask us to guarantee military support in the Formosa (Taiwan) area, nor have they received such a guarantee."

### 不反对侵略行动  却叫嚷不用武力  麦克米伦为美国帮腔

    不反对侵略行动  却叫嚷不用武力
    麦克米伦为美国帮腔
    据新华社伦敦25日电  英国首相麦克米伦今天同由九个工会领袖组成的英国职工大会的代表团举行了两个多小时的会谈。这个代表八百万有组织的英国工人的英国职工大会全国理事会在前一天发表声明，要求政府明白表示英国决不卷入到美国为阻挠中国解放沿海岛屿而可能引起的战争中去。理事会的声明还说，英国政府有责任说服美国政府不要为金门马祖而进行一次战争。
    麦克米伦在同代表团会面的时候并没有明白表示英国承认中国政府对沿海岛屿的主权以及英国将不支持美国对中国的侵略挑衅政策。他只是说：“英国政府愿意帮助用外交谈判的方法谋求福摩萨（台湾）争端的解决。”
    麦克米伦没有正面回答职工大会代表团的强烈要求——英国人民决不容许把他们自己卷入一场可能变成广泛得多的战争中去，他只是说，英国政府的政策是：“整个国际大家庭应该一致坚持不用武力来解决台湾地区的争端”。大家知道，美国正在千方百计地玩弄“不使用武力”和“停火”的阴谋，企图使美国的侵略行为合法化并且阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土。麦克米伦在这里显然是支持美国的这种干涉中国内政的论调，他完全没有满足英国公众要求同美国的侵略和玩火政策划清界线的要求。
    麦克米伦说：表示他赞成用谈判的办法来解决问题，他并且说，中美两国正在华沙继续谈判，“看不出目前在任何其他讲坛进行讨论会有助于问题的解决。”
    会谈后麦克米伦同代表团商定发表的声明说，麦克米伦对代表团重申了他给工党领袖盖茨克尔的信中所说的话：“我们的美国盟友既没有设法要求我们保证在福摩萨（台湾）地区给予军事支持，也没有得到这种保证。”
