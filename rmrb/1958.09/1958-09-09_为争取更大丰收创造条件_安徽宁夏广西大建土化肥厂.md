　　In order to prepare sufficient fertilizer for the autumn planting, Anhui, Ningxia, Guangxi and other provinces and regions are building large numbers of indigenous fertilizer plants. By August 25, Anhui Province had established a total of 257,300 indigenous fertilizer plants, producing 147 kinds of indigenous fertilizers, totaling more than 68,487,000 dan.
    Leaders at all levels have strengthened ideological leadership in the production of indigenous fertilizers. They have launched extensive debates to break down the masses' superstitious ideas, and the speed of building indigenous fertilizer plants has greatly accelerated. In the last fifteen days alone, more than 117,000 indigenous fertilizer plants have been established, and many counties have established indigenous fertilizer plants in every team. The masses praised:
    "Walking through village after village,
    Fertilizer plants are everywhere,
    Relying on the masses to make fertilizer,
    A bumper harvest in autumn is guaranteed."
    In the vast rural areas of Ningxia, more than 4,039 various indigenous fertilizer plants have been established in the twenty days from the beginning of August to the end of the month, and all have been put into production. As of August 23, 47 kinds of indigenous fertilizers had been manufactured, totaling more than 23,674,000 jin.
    A large-scale indigenous fertilizer campaign is being carried out throughout the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 100,000 indigenous fertilizer plants that have been built and put into production in counties and cities throughout the autonomous region, producing nearly 2 million tons of indigenous fertilizer, averaging more than 300 jin per mu of late rice.
    The large-scale indigenous fertilizer campaign was launched during the production upsurge centered on field management. In the manufacture of indigenous fertilizers, various localities have utilized many raw materials that could not be used for farm manure. For example, the smoke from chimneys, snail shells, clam shells, etc., can all become good raw materials for indigenous fertilizers.

　　为争取更大丰收创造条件
    安徽宁夏广西大建土化肥厂
　　本报讯　为了给秋种准备充足的肥料，安徽、宁夏、广西等省区大建土化肥厂。到8月25日，安徽省共建立二十五万七千三百多个土化肥厂，已生产土化肥一百四十七种，共六千八百四十八万七千多担。
    各级领导在土化肥生产中加强了思想领导。开展了大辩论，打破了群众的迷信思想，建土化肥厂的速度大大加快了。在最近十五天内就建立土化肥厂十一万七千多个，有许多县已是队队建立了土化肥厂。群众赞扬说：
    “走一庄，又一庄，
    到处都有化肥厂，
    依靠群众造化肥，
    秋季丰收有保障。”
    宁夏地区广大农村中，从8月初到月底的二十多天的时间已建立起各种土化肥厂四千零三十九个，并且已全部投入生产。截至8月23日，已经制造出四十七种土化肥，二千三百六十七万四千多斤。
    大搞土化肥运动正在广西僮族自治区普遍展开。据不完全统计，全自治区各县、市建成并投入生产的土化肥厂有十万多个，共生产土化肥近二百万吨，平均每亩晚稻有三百斤以上。
    大搞土化肥运动是在以田间管理为中心的生产高潮中开展起来的。各地在制造土化肥中，利用了许多农家肥无法利用的原料。例如烟囱冒出的火烟、螺壳、蚌壳等等，都可成为土制化肥的良好原料。
