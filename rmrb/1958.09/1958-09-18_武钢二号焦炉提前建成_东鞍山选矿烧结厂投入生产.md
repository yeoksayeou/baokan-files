    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 17th: The Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 coking oven was completed ahead of schedule and ignited for baking on September 13th.
    In order to complete this coke oven as soon as possible, the furnace-building workers only used thirty-nine days to build all the refractory bricks, fifty-one days ahead of the national plan and twenty and a half days ahead of the No. 1 coke oven, creating the highest national record for coke oven construction.
    Xinhua News Agency: The first phase of China's largest artificial rich iron ore integrated plant, the Anshan Iron and Steel Group's Dong'anshan Beneficiation and Sintering Plant, was put into production on the 11th.
    The commissioning of this plant provides an important condition for Anshan Iron and Steel to achieve its leap forward plan for steel production this year. According to experiments: the heat used to smelt one ton of natural rich iron ore can be used to smelt one and a half tons of artificial rich iron ore. Therefore, the large-scale use of sintered ore for ironmaking can greatly increase the pig iron output per unit volume of the blast furnace. After the production capacity of the first phase of the Dong'anshan Beneficiation and Sintering Plant is realized in the short term, the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant can use artificial rich iron ore as raw material, and the daily output of pig iron can be increased by more than 400 tons. In addition, after this plant is put into production, because the amount of sintered ore can gradually meet the needs of ironmaking, Anshan Iron and Steel's existing four sintering plants can concentrate their efforts to improve the iron content of artificial rich iron ore. According to calculations, if the iron content of the artificial rich iron ore used by the existing blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel is increased from the current 50% to about 54%, the daily output of pig iron can leap to 1,000 tons.
    The Dong'anshan Beneficiation and Sintering Plant is a huge capital construction project of Anshan Iron and Steel, and its entire production process is equipped with modern technology. The second phase of this plant will be completed in the first quarter of next year. At that time, Dong'anshan will become Anshan Iron and Steel's most magnificent raw material base.

### 武钢二号焦炉提前建成  东鞍山选矿烧结厂投入生产

    武钢二号焦炉提前建成
    东鞍山选矿烧结厂投入生产
    新华社武汉17日电　武汉钢铁公司二号炼焦炉，在9月13日提前建成并点火烘炉。
    为了尽快建成这座焦炉，筑炉职工只用三十九天的时间就砌好了全部耐火砖，比国家规定的计划提前了五十一天，比一号焦炉提前了二十天半，创造了全国砌筑焦炉的最高纪录。
    据新华社讯　我国目前规模最大的人造富铁矿联合工厂——鞍钢东鞍山选矿烧结厂第一期工程11日投入生产。
    这座工厂投入生产，为鞍钢实现今年钢铁生产跃进计划提供了重要条件。据试验证明：熔炼一吨天然富铁矿所用的热量，就可以熔炼一吨半人造富铁矿。因此，大量采用烧结矿炼铁，就能够大大提高高炉单位容积的生铁产量。东鞍山选矿烧结厂第一期工程的生产能力在短期内发挥以后，鞍钢炼铁厂可以全部用人造富铁矿作原料，每天的生铁产量可以增产四百多吨。此外，这座工厂投入生产以后，由于烧结矿数量可以逐步满足炼铁需要，鞍钢现有的四座烧结厂就可以集中力量提高人造富铁矿含铁成分。据计算，鞍钢现有高炉使用的人造富铁矿，其含铁成分如果由现在的50％左右提高到54％，生铁日产量就能跃增一千吨。
    东鞍山选矿烧结厂，是鞍钢基建工程上规模巨大的一项，它的全部生产过程都是用现代化技术装备起来的。这个厂第二期工程将在明年第一季度建成。那时，东鞍山将成为鞍钢规模最宏伟的原料基地。
