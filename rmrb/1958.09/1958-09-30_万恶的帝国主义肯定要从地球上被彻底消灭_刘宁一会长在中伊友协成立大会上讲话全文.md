Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: Following is the full text of the speech by Liu Ningyi, President of the China-Iraq Friendship Association, at the celebration of the establishment of the China-Iraq Friendship Association: Dear friends and comrades:

    Today, representatives from all walks of life in our capital are gathered here to solemnly celebrate the establishment of the China-Iraq Friendship Association and to welcome friends from the newly born Republic of Iraq. Everyone is filled with excitement and joy. Since the day of the Iraqi people's revolutionary victory, the entire Chinese people have been filled with friendly feelings and deep respect for the people of the Republic of Iraq. Now, let our conference, on behalf of the 600 million Chinese people, once again express our heartfelt congratulations on the birth of the Republic of Iraq and cheer enthusiastically for the great victory of the Iraqi people's revolution!

    We are honored to have the opportunity to meet and welcome the first envoys of the Iraqi people – the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation headed by Chief Mahmoud, the Iraqi Cultural Delegation headed by Chief Zarzara, and Mr. Hassan, the representative of the Iraqi Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, and other distinguished Iraqi guests. They represent a wide range of Iraqi people from all walks of life. They have worked hard for the cause of Iraqi independence and liberation. They are staunch fighters against imperialism and defenders of peace. Many of them are outstanding figures who have made important contributions to the victory of this Iraqi people's revolution. They have come a long way to our country despite all the hardships. They have brought the profound friendship and valuable support of the Iraqi people to the Chinese people. Please allow me, on behalf of the conference and the entire Chinese people, to extend a warm welcome to them and, through them, to express our heartfelt respect to the heroic Iraqi people who have swiftly, thoroughly, and resolutely swept away the imperialist forces and traitors.

    The victory of the Iraqi revolution inspired the people of the world
    The spine of imperialist aggression in West Asia has been broken

    Comrades and friends, on July 14th this year, a thunderclap resounded in Baghdad. The Iraqi people drove away the imperialist forces and overthrew the reactionary feudal dynasty that betrayed the country in one morning. The Republic of Iraq was declared established with lightning speed, shaking the world, frightening the imperialists, and delighting the people of all countries. The Iraqi people have made a great contribution to the great cause of opposing imperialism and safeguarding peace, and have written another glorious page in the annals of the world's people's struggle for independence and freedom. Due to the great victory of the Iraqi people, the entire situation in the Middle East has been fundamentally changed. The spine of imperialist aggression in West Asia has been broken, and the imperialist plan of aggression in the Middle East has been disrupted, transforming Iraq from an imperialist cornerstone of aggression in the Middle East into a bulwark against imperialist aggression. We believe that all peoples fighting for national independence and against imperialism will gain valuable experience and learn a brilliant example from the struggle of the Iraqi people. That is: If imperialism and its agents in various countries stubbornly adhere to anti-people's criminal policies, the people will surely rise up in unison and resolutely and swiftly eliminate them completely!

    The victory of the Iraqi people is a new development in a series of great victories of the Asian and African people, especially the Arab people, in recent years. The Egyptian people's struggle to defend the Suez Canal, the Syrian people's struggle to resist the American aggressors, the Algerian people's struggle for national independence, the Omani and Yemeni people's struggle against British aggressors, the Lebanese people's struggle against imperialist running dogs, and the struggle of the vast African people for national independence and anti-colonialism are all preludes to the Iraqi people's struggle. The success of the Iraqi people's revolution is a historically significant event in the surging national independence movement in the vast Asian and African regions. The Arab people's struggle for independence, the national liberation struggle of the entire Asian and African continents, the liberation struggle of the oppressed nations around the world, and the struggle of the people around the world for peace and against new wars will all be greatly encouraged by this and move towards a new upsurge.

    The people of China and Iraq have brotherly feelings
    This friendship will achieve brilliant development in the future

    The victory of the Iraqi people has won warm congratulations and support from the people of Asian, African and other countries around the world, and has been given high praise and praise. Because we Chinese people have long been subjected to aggression and oppression by imperialism and its lackeys, this common painful experience with the Iraqi people makes the Chinese people feel particularly brotherly sympathy for the heroic struggle of the Iraqi people, and we are particularly excited about the great victory of the Iraqi revolution! We deeply feel from the bottom of our hearts that the struggle of the Iraqi people is the struggle of the Chinese people themselves, and the victory of the Iraqi people is the victory of the Chinese people themselves. We believe that this strong friendship between the Chinese and Iraqi people cannot be destroyed by any imperialist forces.

    Dear friends and comrades, the friendship between our two peoples is based not only on a common cause, but also on a long historical tradition. Centuries ago, the Chinese and Iraqi people established friendly ties, engaged in frequent trade exchanges, and exchanged ideas and scientific and artistic achievements. After imperialism invaded the countries of the East, this friendly relationship gradually decreased and was even completely severed. But now, new world-shaking changes have taken place. China and Iraq have freed themselves from the shackles of imperialism and achieved revolutionary victories. Now, China and Iraq have formally established diplomatic relations. Undoubtedly, the governments and peoples of China and Iraq will restore and develop the friendly relations between the two peoples on the basis of the Bandung spirit and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Now, the China-Iraq Friendship Association has been established. This is a major event in the history of China-Iraq friendship, and it will push the cause of China-Iraq friendship to a new stage. At the same time, we believe that the Iraqi friends who have come to visit our country are pioneer representatives in realizing this friendly relationship, and they will make important contributions to promoting the friendship between the Chinese and Iraqi people. Let us wish the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Iraqi people a more brilliant new development under our joint efforts.

    The national independence movement has become an irresistible trend
    U.S. imperialism is still intensifying its aggression in Asia and Africa

    Comrades and friends: In our era, the struggle for national independence and against colonialism has formed an irresistible and tremendous trend throughout the world. In recent years, the national independence movement has risen rapidly, not only from Southeast Asia to the Near and Middle East, but also to the African continent and Latin America. The world people's anti-colonial struggle is advancing bravely under the impetus of the Bandung spirit. The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo this year was an even greater demonstration of the Afro-Asian people against colonialism and imperialism. This conference shows that the Afro-Asian people are moving towards a closer and broader road. Recently, good news of the national independence movement has come one after another. Following the birth of the Republic of Iraq, the Provisional Government of Algeria was proclaimed on September 19. The birth of the Republic of Algeria is an important milestone on the road to victory for the Algerian national independence movement. It once again shows that no matter how cruelly and barbarously the colonialists suppress it, as long as the people unite and carry out unyielding struggle, the colonialists will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat. Here, on behalf of the conference and the entire Chinese people, I would like to once again extend our heartfelt congratulations and respect to the Algerian people. We wish them an early and complete victory in their just struggle for national independence.

    However, the imperialists will obviously not relax their interference in the people striving for independence and the people who have already achieved independence. U.S. imperialism has repeatedly created tension and intensified its aggression throughout the world, especially in Asia and Africa. The United States has tried every means to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea and Vietnam; openly supported armed rebels in subversive activities against the Republic of Indonesia; armed intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon and delayed the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon and the Middle East, and threatened the security of the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic, and so on. Now, U.S. imperialism is carrying out aggression and provocation against China in the Taiwan Strait area. The increasingly barbaric acts of aggression by the U.S. aggressors against China and the people of Asian and African countries prove that it is not only the mortal enemy of China, but also the common and most ferocious enemy of the people of Asian and African countries and the people of the world.

    U.S. imperialism is frantically carrying out military provocations against our country
    Our people must drive the aggressors out of the Taiwan region

    As everyone knows, the U.S. aggressors are currently concentrating a large number of pirate troops, naval and air forces in the Taiwan Strait area of our country, carrying out rampant military provocations and threats of war to barbarously interfere with our people's liberation of their own territory of Taiwan and the recovery of Kinmen, Matsu and other coastal islands, and are constantly expanding the scope of their aggression against our country, repeatedly violating our territorial waters and airspace, seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. We solemnly point out here that the U.S. aggressors are currently using the Warsaw Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks to cover up their stepped-up preparations for war against China, while playing the trick of so-called "ceasefire" to deceive world public opinion in order to achieve the goal of legalizing its aggression. Everyone knows that there is no war between China and the United States, and there is no "ceasefire" at all. In order to ease the tense situation and avoid war, the only issue at present is for the U.S. bandits to stop the crime of "setting fire," and for the U.S. invading troops to withdraw completely and immediately from the Taiwan Strait area. The Chinese people will never give up their struggle against U.S. aggression as long as the U.S. aggressors do not withdraw.

    We want to seriously warn U.S. imperialism once again that the Chinese people love peace, but any war threat from U.S. imperialism cannot scare the 600 million Chinese people who have been tested by revolution and are united as one. The U.S. imperialists' rampant aggression and provocation against our people in the Taiwan Strait area have aroused the Chinese people's incomparable anger, and have ignited a powerful anti-aggression movement like a storm across the country. Nearly 400 million people in urban and rural areas across China have participated in this powerful demonstration and protest movement, showing the Chinese people's firm will to defend their motherland, defend peace, and oppose aggression.

    Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are currently building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical manner with soaring enthusiasm and a great leap forward posture of one day equaling twenty years. We have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest on the agricultural front this year. Currently, the entire Chinese people are fighting tensely to successfully complete 10.7 million tons of steel and more machinery and grain. The movement to establish people's communes is widely launched throughout the country. The people across the country are accelerating the implementation of all-people armament, ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, and together with the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, fight to safeguard our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

    The world's forces for peace and justice have become unprecedentedly strong
    U.S. robbers will be hanged if they do not abandon their policy of aggression

    Dear Iraqi friends, your visit to our country at this moment has greatly encouraged our people's determination to resolutely defend the motherland, resist aggression, and build socialism. There is an old Chinese saying, "Those who gain the Tao will have more help." The Chinese people's just struggle against aggression is not isolated. It has received the deep sympathy and active support of countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, as well as the support and support from the people of Arab countries and the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. Here, please allow us to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt gratitude to the people of the Republic of Iraq, the people of the United Arab Republic, and the entire Arab people for their enthusiastic support in our people's struggle against U.S. aggression. The Chinese people's defense of their national sovereignty, liberation of Taiwan, and recovery of Jinmen and Matsu cannot be stopped by any force. If the U.S. aggressors disregard the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and the firm opposition of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, and dare to impose war on the Chinese people, then our people will spare no effort to resist aggression, safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, and defend peace in the Far East and the world. Fight to resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate the aggressors.

    Today, the people of the world are unprecedentedly united, and the forces for peace are unprecedentedly strong. The East wind continues to prevail over the West wind. This situation is beneficial to the people all over the world who are striving for peace and opposing aggression. The current tension created by the United States in the Near and Middle East and the Far East is that they themselves are willing to put the noose around their necks and hand the other end of the noose to the Chinese people, the people of Arab countries, and all peace-loving people in the world who oppose aggression. Our people's great leader Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "If the U.S. monopoly capitalist group insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably be hanged by the people of the world one day. Other U.S. accomplices will also be like this." The forces of peace and justice will surely defeat the war forces of imperialism and all reactionary forces. The people of the world will surely push history forward, and the evil colonialism and imperialism will surely be completely eliminated from the earth!

    The Chinese people and the people of the entire socialist countries
    Will always fight shoulder to shoulder with the Arab people

    We reiterate here that the Chinese people fully support the struggle of the Iraqi and Arab people to safeguard national independence, oppose imperialist aggression, and defend peace. We firmly demand that the U.S. and British aggressor troops immediately and completely get out of Lebanon, Jordan, and the Near and Middle East. We firmly oppose imperialism taking any form to threaten and conspire to interfere in the newborn Republic of Iraq. Friends from Iraq and Arab countries, in the struggle to safeguard national independence, oppose imperialism, and defend peace, the Chinese people and the people of the entire socialist countries will always stand with you! We will always fight shoulder to shoulder with you and work closely together to advance against the common enemy!

    Dear Iraqi friends, before I conclude my speech, please allow me to once again express the Chinese people's warm welcome to you. We hope that you can stay in our country for a longer time and see more places. The Chinese people have achieved unprecedented achievements in their construction, but our country is still young and has only been established for nine years. There is still a lot of work to be done or improved. Please give us your criticisms and suggestions without hesitation. I am willing to assure our friends that no matter where you go in our country, you can see the warm and friendly hands of the Chinese people extending to you. They welcome guests from afar from the bottom of their hearts. I wish you a smooth, pleasant and healthy visit. Finally, we hope that our dear Iraqi friends will bring the Chinese people's deep friendship and sincere wishes to the Iraqi people and Prime Minister Qasim. We wish the Republic of Iraq prosperity and the Iraqi people happiness.

    Long live the great victory of the Iraqi people's revolution!
    Long live the friendly unity of the Chinese and Iraqi people!
    Long live the great unity of the Asian and African people!
    Long live the national independence movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America!
    Long live world peace!

    万恶的帝国主义肯定要从地球上被彻底消灭
    刘宁一会长在中伊友协成立大会上讲话全文
    新华社29日讯  中国伊拉克友好协会会长刘宁一在庆祝中伊友好协会成立大会上的讲话。全文如下：亲爱的朋友们，同志们：
    今天我们首都各界代表在这里隆重集会，庆祝中国伊拉克友好协会的成立，同时欢迎来自新生的伊拉克共和国的朋友们，我们每个人都抑止不住内心的兴奋和喜悦。自从伊拉克人民革命胜利的一天起，全中国人民就对伊拉克共和国人民充满着友好的感情和深切的敬意。现在，首先让我们的大会，代表中国六亿人民在这里再一次为伊拉克共和国的诞生表示衷心祝贺，为伊拉克人民革命的伟大胜利而热烈欢呼！
    我们感到很荣幸，我们有机会在这里会见和欢迎第一批伊拉克人民的使者——以马哈茂德团长为首的伊拉克人民友好代表团和以扎尔扎拉团长为首的伊拉克文化代表团以及伊拉克亚非团结委员会代表哈山先生等伊拉克贵宾。他们代表了广泛的伊拉克各阶层人民。他们曾为伊拉克独立解放事业进行过艰苦的奋斗，他们是反对帝国主义和保卫和平的坚强战士，他们中有许多位是为这次伊拉克人民革命胜利作出了重要贡献的杰出人物。他们不辞辛苦地从远道而来到我们国家。他们带来了伊拉克人民对中国人民的深厚的友谊和宝贵的支持。请允许我代表大会，代表全中国人民，向他们表示热烈的欢迎，并通过他们向迅速、彻底、坚决扫荡了帝国主义势力和卖国贼的英勇的全体伊拉克人民表示衷心的敬意。
    伊拉克革命的胜利鼓舞了世界人民
    帝国主义在西亚侵略脊骨已被打断
    同志们，朋友们，今年7月14日，巴格达响起一声春雷，伊拉克人民在一个早晨就把帝国主义势力赶跑了，把出卖祖国的反动的封建王朝推翻了。伊拉克共和国以迅雷不及掩耳之势宣告成立，震动了全世界，吓得帝国主义心慌意乱，使各国人民欢欣鼓舞。伊拉克人民为反对帝国主义和维护和平的伟大事业作出了巨大贡献，在世界人民争取独立自由的史册上又写下了光辉灿烂的一页。由于伊拉克人民的伟大胜利，根本改变了中东的整个局势，帝国主义在西部亚洲的侵略脊背被打断了，帝国主义在中东的侵略计划被打乱了，使伊拉克由帝国主义在中东的侵略基石一变而为反对帝国主义侵略的一个堡垒。我们相信，一切为争取民族独立、反对帝国主义的各国人民，将从伊拉克人民的斗争中得到宝贵的经验和学习的光辉榜样。那就是：如果帝国主义和它在各国的代理人顽固地坚持反人民的罪恶政策，人民将必定要一致奋起，坚决、迅速地把他们彻底消灭！
    伊拉克人民的胜利是亚非人民特别是阿拉伯人民近年来一系列巨大胜利的新发展。埃及人民保卫苏伊士运河的斗争，叙利亚人民反抗美国侵略者的斗争，阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的斗争，阿曼和也门反抗英国侵略者的斗争，黎巴嫩人民反抗帝国主义走狗的斗争，以及广大非洲人民争取民族独立和反殖民主义的斗争，都是伊拉克人民斗争的前奏。伊拉克人民革命的成功是广大亚非地区澎湃汹涌的民族独立运动的一次具有历史意义的事件，阿拉伯人民的独立斗争、整个亚非两洲的民族解放斗争、全世界被压迫民族的解放斗争和全世界人民争取和平反对新战争的斗争，都将因此而受到巨大的鼓舞，走向新的高涨。
    中伊两国人民有着兄弟般的感情
    这种友谊今后将得到辉煌的发展
    伊拉克人民革命的胜利，赢得了亚非各国及全世界各国广大人民的热烈祝贺和支持，并给以高度的评价和赞扬。我们中国人民由于过去曾长期受着帝国主义及其走狗的侵略和压迫，这种和伊拉克人民共同的痛苦经验，使中国人民对伊拉克人民的英勇斗争，格外感到兄弟般的同情，对于伊拉克革命取得伟大胜利格外感到兴奋！我们从内心里深深感到：伊拉克人民的斗争就是中国人民自己的斗争，伊拉克人民的胜利就是中国人民自己的胜利。我们相信，中伊两国人民这种坚强的友谊是任何帝国主义势力所破坏不了的。
    亲爱的朋友们和同志们，我们中伊两国人民的友谊不仅是因为有着共同的事业的基础，而且还有着悠久的历史传统。多少世纪前，中伊人民就建立了友好联系，进行过频繁的贸易往来，交流了思想和科学艺术的成就。在帝国主义侵入东方各国后，这种友谊关系就逐渐减少、甚至完全被割断了。但是现在发生了新的震动世界的变化。中伊两国已摆脱了帝国主义的束缚，取得了革命的胜利。现在中伊两国已正式建立了外交关系。无疑的，中伊两国政府和人民将在万隆精神和和平共处五项原则的基础上，恢复和发展两国人民的友好关系。现在，中伊友协成立了，这是在中伊友谊史上的重大事件，它将把中伊友好事业推向一个新的阶段。同时，我们相信，这次来我国访问的各位伊拉克朋友们，便是实现这种友好关系的先驱代表，他们将为促进中伊人民的友谊作出重要贡献。让我们预祝中伊两国人民的兄弟友谊，在我们共同的努力下，获得更辉煌的新的发展。
    民族独立运动已成不可抗拒的潮流
    美帝国主义仍在亚非地区加紧侵略
    同志们，朋友们：在我们这个时代里，争取民族独立，反对殖民主义的争斗，已经形成在全世界范围内的不可抵挡的巨大潮流。最近几年来，民族独立运动风起云涌，不但从东南亚扩展到中近东，而且扩展到非洲大陆和拉丁美洲。世界人民反殖民主义的斗争在万隆精神推动下在勇猛前进。今年在开罗举行的亚非人民团结大会更是亚非人民反对殖民主义和帝国主义的大示威。这次大会表明亚非人民正在向更加紧密和更加广泛的道路上迈进。最近，民族独立运动的喜讯一个接一个传来，继伊拉克共和国的诞生，现在阿尔及利亚临时政府又于9月19日宣告成立了。阿尔及利亚共和国的诞生是阿尔及利亚民族独立运动走向胜利道路上的一个重要的里程碑，它再一次表明，不管殖民主义者如何残暴野蛮地镇压，只要人民团结一致，进行不屈不挠的斗争，殖民主义者必定要遭到可耻的失败。在这里我愿代表大会和全中国人民，再次向阿尔及利亚人民致以衷心的祝贺和敬意。祝他们争取民族独立的正义斗争早日取得更伟大的完全胜利。
    但是，帝国主义者显然不会放松对于争取独立的人民和已经取得独立的人民的干涉。美帝国主义在全世界，特别是在亚非地区一再制造紧张局势和加紧侵略活动。美国千方百计地阻挠朝鲜、越南的和平统一；公开支持武装叛乱分子进行颠复印度尼西亚共和国的活动；武装干涉黎巴嫩的内政和拖延从黎巴嫩和中东撤军，并威胁伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国的安全等等。现在，美国帝国主义又在我国台湾海峡地区对中国进行侵略和挑衅。美国侵略者对中国和对亚非各国人民越来越野蛮的侵略行为，证明了它不仅是中国的死敌，而且也是亚非各国人民和全世界人民共同的、最凶恶的敌人。
    美帝国主义猖狂地向我国进行军事挑衅
    我国人民一定要把侵略者赶出台湾地区
    大家知道，美国侵略者目前竟在我国台湾海峡地区集中了大量的海盗部队海空军，进行猖狂的军事挑衅和战争威胁来野蛮地干涉我国人民解放自己领土台湾和收复金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，并且还在不断扩大对我国的侵略范围，屡屡侵犯我国的领海和领空，使远东和世界的和平受到严重的威胁。我们在这里严正地指出，美国侵略者正在一面利用华沙中美大使级会议来掩盖其加紧对中国的备战，一面玩弄所谓“停火”的阴谋，欺骗世界公众舆论，以便使它的侵略达到合法化的目的。谁都知道，中国和美国之间，并没有发生战争，根本无“停火”可言。为了缓和紧张局势和避免战争，目前唯一的问题是美国强盗停止“放火”的罪行，是美国侵略军从台湾海峡地区全部立即撤退出去。美国侵略者一天不撤退，六亿中国人民反抗美国侵略的斗争就决不罢休。
    我们要在这里再一次严重地警告美国帝国主义，中国人民是热爱和平的，但是美帝国主义的任何战争威胁都吓不倒久经革命锻炼和团结一致的六亿中国人民。美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区对我国人民进行这样猖狂的侵略和挑衅，使中国人民感到无比的愤怒，在全国范围内激起了一个急如风暴的强大的反侵略运动，全中国城乡有将近四亿人民参加了这个强大的示威和抗议运动，显示了中国人民保卫祖国、保卫和平和反对侵略的坚强意志。
    在中国共产党的英明领导下，中国人民目前正以冲天的干劲和一天等于二十年的大跃进姿态在多、快、好、省地建设社会主义。我们今年在农业战线上获得了一次空前的大丰收，目前全中国人民在为胜利完成一千零七十万吨钢、更多的机械和粮食而紧张战斗。现在在全国各地广泛地展开建立人民公社的运动，全国人民在加快实行全民武装，准备随时响应祖国的号召，与英勇的中国人民解放军一道为维护我国的主权和领土完整而斗争。
    全世界的和平和正义力量已经空前强大
    美国强盗不放弃侵略政策就要被处绞刑
    亲爱的伊拉克朋友们，你们在这一时刻来到我国访问，大大地鼓舞了我国人民坚决保卫祖国、反抗侵略的决心和建设社会主义的热情。中国有句古话叫“得道者多助”。中国人民的反侵略的正义斗争不是孤立的，它得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的深切同情和积极支持，还得到来自阿拉伯国家人民和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及全世界人民的声援和支持。这里，请允许我们趁此机会，对伊拉克共和国人民，阿拉伯联合共和国人民以及全体阿拉伯人民，在我国人民反抗美国侵略的斗争中所给予的热情支持，表示衷心的感谢。中国人民维护自己国家的主权，解放台湾和收复金门、马祖，是任何力量都不能阻挡的，如果美国侵略者竟不顾中国人民的一再警告和全世界爱好和平国家和人民的坚决反对，胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，那么，我国人民，必将不惜一切为反抗侵略、维护祖国的主权和领土完整，以及为保卫远东和世界的和平而战，为坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭侵略者而战。
    今天，全世界人民空前团结，和平力量空前壮大，东风继续压倒西风。这一形势是对全世界争取和平和反对侵略的人民有利的。目前美国在中近东和远东制造紧张局势，是他们自己情愿把绞索套在脖子上，而把绞索的另一端交给了中国人民、阿拉伯各国人民和全世界一切爱好和平反对侵略的人民。我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席明确地指出：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”和平与正义的力量肯定地要战胜帝国主义的战争势力和一切反动势力，世界人民肯定地要推动历史前进，万恶的殖民主义和帝国主义肯定地将从地球上被彻底消灭干净！
    中国人民和整个社会主义国家的人民
    将永远和阿拉伯人民紧密地并肩斗争
    我们在这里重申：中国人民完全支持伊拉克和阿拉伯各国人民维护民族独立、反对帝国主义侵略和保卫和平的斗争。我们坚决要求美英侵略军立即全部从黎巴嫩、约旦和中近东滚出去。我们坚决反对帝国主义采取任何方式威胁和阴谋干涉新生的伊拉克共和国。伊拉克和阿拉伯各国的朋友们，在维护民族独立、反对帝国主义和保卫和平的斗争中，中国人民和整个社会主义国家的人民将永远和你们站在一起！永远和你们并肩斗争，为反对共同敌人而紧密地携手前进！
    亲爱的伊拉克朋友们，在我结束讲话之前，请允许我再一次向你们表达中国人民对你们的热烈欢迎。我们希望你们能在我国多逗留一个时候，多看一些地方。中国人民在建设事业中取得了前所未有的成就，但是我们的国家还年轻，成立才不过九年，还有不少的工作尚待进行或改进，请朋友们不客气地给我们批评指教。我愿意向朋友们保证，你们不论到我国的那一个地方，都可以看到中国人民热情友好的双手是伸向你们的。他们从内心里欢迎远方客人的到来。祝你们访问顺利和愉快健康。最后，我们希望亲爱的伊拉克朋友们，把中国人民对伊拉克人民的深厚友谊和衷心的祝愿带给伊拉克人民和卡赛姆总理，祝伊拉克共和国繁荣，祝伊拉克人民幸福。
    伊拉克人民革命的伟大胜利万岁！
    中伊两国人民友好团结万岁！
    亚非人民大团结万岁！
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族独立运动万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
                （文内插题是本报编者加的）
