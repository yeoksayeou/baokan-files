The Anshan Iron and Steel workers, responding to the Party's call, decided to turn September into a "High Yield Month."
　　Shanghai is fully engaged in the intense battle to produce 1.2 million tons of steel this year.
　　Tianjin held a rally to pledge that they would not be short by even an ounce or a tael in overfulfilling their plan.
　　The Beijing steel army is fully engaged in battle, with twenty-five factories rushing to produce smelting equipment day and night.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, September 1st: The Anshan Iron and Steel workers enthusiastically responded to the call of the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, guaranteeing the realization of this year's leap forward plan for steel production, and decided to launch a "High Yield Month" campaign in September.

This morning, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of party member cadres attended by responsible cadres such as the heads and managers of various Anshan Iron and Steel factories and mines, and construction companies, and made specific arrangements on how to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and ensure the realization of the leap forward plan for steel production.

Yang Kebing, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, analyzed the various conditions for carrying out the "High Yield Month" campaign at the meeting, and put forward various measures on behalf of the Municipal Committee to achieve the "High Yield Month".

This afternoon, the key factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel held expanded meetings of the Party Committee or employee meetings. The broad masses of employees unanimously supported the deployment of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, guaranteeing to take various effective measures to overcome difficulties, so that the production in September would take a greater leap forward. From August 22nd to 31st, the daily steel output of the workers of the First Steel Plant increased by an average of more than 800 tons compared with the first two weeks of August. They plan to increase the average daily steel output in September by more than 500 tons compared with the last ten days of August. The workers of the Second Steel Plant are not showing any weakness either. In the last five days of August, they increased the average daily steel output by 500 tons compared with the first two weeks of August, striving to increase the daily output in September by 400 tons compared with the daily output of the last five days of August, and releasing even greater high-yield satellites.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 1st: The steel workers of Shanghai are determined to respond enthusiastically to the call of the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with practical actions, and today many exciting good news have been reported.

In the First Steel Plant, a small converter newly built by the workers of the converter workshop in their spare time produced steel today. Steel workers, construction workers, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army supporting the construction of steel are continuing to expand the converter workshop and will build two new converters this month. Today, the steelmaking workers of the entire workshop put forward seven major technical measures, requiring the steel output in September to increase by 3,000 tons compared with the previous month.

The Alloy Steel Plant, a vital force in Shanghai's steel industry, completed the first phase of construction today after one hundred and eight days of rapid construction, and produced the first furnace of alloy steel. The steelmaking workers broke the world convention and made the newly built electric furnace produce alloy steel in the first furnace without going through the process of refining ordinary steel! They plan to produce 8,000 tons of high-grade alloy steel within four months of starting operation, exceeding the national plan by 2,000 tons.

Shanghai's steel production plan for this year has been repeatedly increased, planning to produce 1.2 million tons, more than double last year. All aspects of the city have participated in this great battle for steel. The news that the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the country to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year has further boosted the morale of the steel workers and strengthened their fighting spirit. This morning, the Shanghai Machine Repair General Factory convened an expanded meeting of the Party Committee and decided to establish a steel production headquarters, operations department, and political department, with the Party Secretary and the Factory Director personally directing the operation.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 1st: After the call of the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China reached Tianjin, the steel workers here held a rally today. The vow they made in response to the Party's call was: to ensure that they would overfulfill the production task of 440,000 tons of steel this year without lacking a single ounce or tael.

Zhao Kai, director of the Xinxing Steel Plant, said that all measures should be taken to complete the steel production plan without missing an ounce or a tael. The steelmaking workers of the Tianjin Steel Plant guaranteed that they would fight hard for four months without leaving the battlefield, so that the annual leap forward plan would double that of last year.

At the rally, the employees of the two major steel plants in Tianjin immediately announced that they would launch a friendship competition between the same workshops and the same furnace platform to produce more steel and faster steel.

Echoing the conference, the workers who were making steel on the furnace also reported the victory today. Sun Shifeng's team of the No. 2 open hearth furnace of Tianjin Steel Plant, produced a furnace of high-quality steel in five hours and seventeen minutes at noon today, creating a new record since the double-slot steel output, shortening the melting time per furnace by thirteen minutes compared with the original. More than 20 steelmaking workers and staff members of the Xinxing Steel Plant used waste materials and spare time to build a half-ton small converter in five days and nights of continuous hard work, and put it into production half a month ahead of schedule this afternoon and produced the first furnace of steel.

Xinhua News Agency, September 1st: The steel workers in the capital enthusiastically responded to the call of the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and are determined to go all out to increase more steel for the country.

The workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant are preparing to complete the converter workshop with an annual output of 100,000 tons of steel one to two days ahead of schedule, so that it can be put into production as soon as possible. The workers in the machinery manufacturing workshop posted big-character posters to guarantee that they would produce the equipment required for 150,000 tons of steel at a faster speed in the second phase of the project.

The workers of the Beijing Steel Plant held a rally in the rain today, expressing their determination to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee with their practical actions, and to produce five times more steel in the last four months of this year than in the previous eight months. Now the workers of this factory are, on the one hand, vigorously carrying out technological revolution and tapping the potential of the original steelmaking furnaces, and on the other hand, accelerating the construction of new steelmaking workshops. The workers guarantee that the new steelmaking furnace will be put into production on September 25.

In addition to some factories specializing in steel production, some units that have never produced steel are now actively engaged in steel production. The repair shop of the Beijing Second Construction Company, which has never had anyone who has refined steel before, has built sixteen large and small converters, three cupola furnaces, and five or six blowers in a very short time. Now three small converters have been put into production, and the large converter will be ignited for production in a day or two. Today, the workers of this factory were even more enthusiastic after reading the newspaper, and posted many big-character posters and slogans, proposing to produce 500 tons of steel before the National Day.

In order to meet the needs of steel production, the workers of twenty-five factories in the city are now working day and night to rush to produce smelting equipment and rolling mills.
