    Militiaman's Short Flute
    Guo Ruiqing, worker at North China Radio Factory
  When the whistle for exercise blows, a human wall is formed,
  In the human wall, blades of light flash.
  Eyes like lamps, gazing into the distance,
  The distance is ripe crops,
  About to go into the granary.

  The gun handler holds a steel gun,
  His heart itching,
  Asking the company commander: When can we go to the front?

  The old company commander takes the gun,
  Looks at it again and again, examines it again and again,
  Presses his lips to it, hugs it to his chest.
  Like meeting a long-separated relative.

    民兵短笛
    华北无线电厂工人　果瑞卿
  练操哨声一响，排起一道人墙，人墙里，闪着刀光。眼睛如灯，了视远方，远方是熟透了的庄稼，将要进仓。
  发枪手握钢枪，心里痒痒，问连长：啥时才能上前方？
  老连长连长接过枪，看又看，相又相，贴贴嘴巴，挨挨胸膛。像会见了久别的亲
  人一样。
