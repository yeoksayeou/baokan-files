Japan's Economic Expansion in Southeast Asia
　　Zhang Tingzheng

Japanese monopoly capital is now attempting to follow the old path of imperialism, eager to carry out economic expansion abroad. Its expansionist spearhead is primarily aimed at Southeast Asia.

40% of Japan's export market is in Asia, with 70% of that in Southeast Asia. During the Five Ambassadors Conference held in Japan this July to discuss the issue of foreign expansion, they unanimously agreed that Japan's prosperity had an "indissoluble" relationship with Southeast Asia, and therefore advocated that the work of "developing" economically underdeveloped countries should focus on Southeast Asia. Japan's "New Economic Five-Year Plan" (1958-1962), which centers on expanding exports, also places the key to its export plan in Southeast Asia. By 1962, exports to Southeast Asia will account for 35% of Japan's total exports, with machinery alone accounting for more than a quarter of that. That is to say, Japan wants to increase its export volume by 1.9 times in five years, but to expand its exports to Southeast Asia by 2.4 times.

Japan's economic expansion in Southeast Asia aims to seize cheap raw material bases and stable export markets. Although the "White Paper on Economic Cooperation" published by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry in May of this year listed various reasons to prove that "economic cooperation" is fundamentally different from the colonial policies of the past, it ultimately revealed its true intentions: the "basic policy" for Japan to conduct economic cooperation with Southeast Asian countries is to "enjoy commercial benefits," "export capital goods, import raw materials," and it "must also adapt to the direction of Japan's economic development." It is evident that this is a thorough colonial policy. Accepting such "cooperation" will mean allowing Japan to carry out economic plunder, turning Southeast Asia into its sales market and raw material production base, and making it impossible to establish an independent national economy.

A Rehash of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"

Japanese monopoly capital has been the most aggressive from the moment it was born. Almost all of its development has relied on aggression and war. This nature has not changed even after the Second World War. Before the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, Japanese monopoly capital had been working for five years but still failed to bring industrial production to pre-war levels. However, after the outbreak of the Korean War, because Japan played the role of a base for the US military invading Korea, it only took four months for industrial production to exceed pre-war levels, and on this basis, it achieved considerable development. It is thus clear that Japanese monopoly capital relied on wars of aggression to get its start before the war, and then relied on war profiteering to rise again after the war. Precisely because it reaped this bloody ill-gotten wealth, strengthening Japan's economic power, Japanese monopoly capital once again fantasizes about reliving the old dream of the "Greater Japanese Empire" and chose the war criminal Nobusuke Kishi, who is rich in aggressive experience, to carry out this task for them. When Nobusuke Kishi, in accordance with the will of Japanese monopoly capital, went to Southeast Asia for his first visit last May, Dosuke Sugi, a spokesperson for the Kansai financial and business community and chairman of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, "Without restoring its position in Southeast Asia, Japan cannot restore its position in the world." This shows that the Japanese ruling class has never forgotten the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and has pinned its hopes for reviving Japanese imperialism on controlling and developing Southeast Asia.

However, to develop Southeast Asia, a huge amount of funds is required. Although Japan has the desire to export capital, it does not have the ability to export large amounts of capital. Therefore, Kishi Nobusuke formulated the "Southeast Asia Development Fund Plan," which attempts to use American capital and Japanese technology to "develop" Southeast Asian resources. The Japanese magazine "Economist," published on November 2 last year, commented that this idea is based on the United States as the boss in the background, with Japan posing as the "Asian leader" to engage in the economic development of Southeast Asia. In fact, this idea is nothing new. As early as 1954, when Shigeru Yoshida visited the United States, he proposed a similar so-called "Asian Economic Cooperation Bureau" plan, but it had to be abandoned because it did not gain favor from its American masters.

The "Southeast Asia Development Fund Plan" of Kishi Nobusuke is an old trick of imperialist economic aggression and a concrete step in reviving the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Even the Kyodo News Agency, which is employed by Japanese monopoly capital, admitted that it "is undoubtedly something like that" (Kyodo News Agency dispatch on July 10). The scope of this plan is very wide, and its purpose is not only to open up roads for Japan to expand its market and plunder raw materials, but also signifies that Japan is actively engaged in the struggle to re-divide the market and establish its sphere of influence, and wants to use American power to squeeze Britain and West Germany out of the Southeast Asian market.

However, Kishi Nobusuke's wishful thinking fell through. Southeast Asian countries saw through this as a rehash of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and expressed indifference or opposition. Kishi Nobusuke himself could not but admit that Southeast Asian countries suspected "Japan has special intentions." And the United States is also unwilling to pay to restore Japan's "world status" and give up the Southeast Asian market. Kishi Nobusuke waited for years, but the United States has always "not shown a good attitude" (Kishi Nobusuke's words), which was a heavy blow to him and Japanese monopoly capital.

Actually Wants to Fill the "Vacuum" Too

In disappointment, Japan had to rely on its own strength to compete in the Southeast Asian market. The main methods are war reparations, yen loans, technical cooperation, and private investment. Japan's debt repayment is in the form of goods, so for Japanese monopoly capital, it is not only the most favorable and reliable commodity export, but also an important means of carrying out economic expansion. Japanese monopoly capital has used reparations to open up new markets for heavy industrial products that lack sales channels, and has also driven export trade. In 1957, Japan's exports to Southeast Asia increased by 100 million US dollars compared to 1956, of which 70% was exports to the Philippines and Burma, and the increase in exports to the Philippines and Burma was mostly due to reparations exports. In recent years, Japanese machinery and equipment have been able to occupy a place in the imports of the Philippines and Burma, which is also due to reparations. This proves that reparations have become an effective weapon for Japan to seize the market.

Japan's private investment in Southeast Asia is concentrated in iron ore and non-ferrous metals that it lacks. From 1954 to the end of 1956, Japan's total import volume of iron ore was 18.3 million tons, of which 7.4 million tons (26%) were obtained due to investment in Southeast Asia. And the total import of copper ore from 1955 to 1956 was 36,400 tons, of which 18,500 tons (more than 50%) were also imported due to investment in Southeast Asia. In addition, Japan has also used the export of machinery and equipment to offset the import of raw materials to Southeast Asia, which has saved Japan 8.1 million US dollars in foreign exchange.

However, Japan's economic strength is ultimately limited, so it has concentrated its efforts to first compete for the markets of India and Indonesia. Therefore, Japan, in the face of the economic crisis, actually loaned India 50 million US dollars, while the "Southeast Asia Development Cooperation Fund" established by Japan is only 15 million US dollars. This year, Japan also signed a trade agreement with India, according to which Japan has obtained most-favored-nation treatment. For example, Japanese can remit profits abroad, can freely enter India and reside in India, and also enjoy the right to remit money. In fact, India has become one of the main markets for Japan's heavy industrial products. Last year, Japan's steel exports to India accounted for 26% of its total exports, textile machinery accounted for 20.6% of its total exports, and railway vehicles accounted for 49% of its total exports.

Indonesia has been Japan's main market both before and after the war. After the Dutch colonialists were expelled, Japan had the ambition to replace the Netherlands' economic position in the area. According to Japan's "Toyo Keizai Shinpo" (February 8 issue), after Japan's reparations and economic cooperation agreements with Indonesia were signed, Japanese monopolists believed that "Indonesia not only has agricultural products such as rubber, copra, and sugar, but is also rich in mineral resources such as oil, tin, and bauxite. Since the Dutch forces have been driven away, a vacuum of capital and technology has been created, so today is a good opportunity for Japan to take advantage of it." This is just like the Eisenhower Doctrine of filling the Middle East "vacuum," completely exposing the imperialist true colors of Japanese monopoly capital.

However, according to a survey by the Japan Asia Association, Japan's annual foreign investment capacity is currently only about 120 million US dollars, and the annual reparations to Burma, the Philippines, and Indonesia total about 65 million US dollars, and private investment in Southeast Asian countries amounted to 19 million US dollars by the end of last year. It is indeed very unlikely to independently develop Southeast Asia with this meager amount. And the US investment in Southeast Asia reached 534 million US dollars by the end of 1955. British investment in Southeast Asia reached 750 million US dollars by the end of 1954. If Japan cannot obtain the support of the United States, it will not only be unable to realize its expansion ambitions in Southeast Asia, but also run the risk of being overwhelmed by the United States and Britain. Therefore, Foreign Minister Fujiyama said that "Japan-US cooperation" is the foundation of Japan's foreign policy, and Japan's economic cooperation with Southeast Asian countries must be based on "Japan-US cooperation." This means that Japan wants to act as the vanguard of the United States' policy of aggression against Southeast Asia. Not only that, Japan also fantasizes about doing things that the United States has not done. According to a report by North American News Alliance on June 27 last year, when Nobusuke Kishi visited the United States last year, he offered a suggestion to the leaders of the US government, saying: It is difficult for the United States to develop Southeast Asia alone, because the United States is still regarded as a colonialist country. If Japan and the United States cooperate, then Southeast Asia, including countries with nationalist tendencies, can be made to stand on the side of the "free world." And Fujiyama, when signing the Japanese reparations agreement with Indonesia in Indonesia at the beginning of this year, launched a so-called "Asian Foreign Ministers Conference," and also said, "It is only meaningful to unite peaceful and neutral countries with Southeast Asian Treaty Organization anti-communist countries." Nobusuke Kishi and Fujiyama conspired to tie nationalist countries to the chariot of US imperialism, which shows how sinister their intentions are.

Fawning on the United States

Nobusuke Kishi's "Southeast Asia Development Fund Plan" has failed, and it is impossible to carry out "development" independently, while Japan's economic crisis is deepening. The second Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet is trying its best to carry out capital exports in order to cope with the economic crisis, and is begging for the support of the United States. The main methods are to use yen loans and deferred payment methods. However, according to the estimate of the Japanese Economic Planning Agency, Japan's ability to export capital with yen loans is currently no more than 100 million US dollars, and this is only possible when the international balance of payments is in surplus. Therefore, Kishi Nobusuke fawned on the United States at a press conference on June 13, saying, "In terms of exports to Southeast Asia, Southeast Asian countries need a lot of Japanese goods, but they don't have money. Therefore, deferred payment methods may be adopted. I want to make the United States agree to this idea, and take reasonable measures to decentralize the US dollars that are too concentrated in the United States, and ask for the cooperation of the United States." However, Taiso Ishizaka, chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, believed after visiting the United States last year that this was impossible, because "the United States has no intention of adopting it." The concentration of US dollars is one of the biggest magic weapons for the United States to control capitalist countries, and it will only give a little alms when it is absolutely necessary to prolong their lives. The United States does not consider Japanese monopoly capital to be a loyal ally, and the most it can do is adopt a policy of neither starving it nor feeding it fully.

The future of Kishi Nobusuke's government's economic expansion in Southeast Asia is not promising. First of all, Southeast Asian countries have fresh memories of the aggression of Japanese imperialism in World War II. Therefore, Southeast Asian countries will not fail to be vigilant about the conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke government and see through its potential imperialist ambitions. Secondly, the capitalist countries, led by the United States, are currently in a crisis or facing a crisis, and are expanding exports and reducing imports. It is unlikely that Japan will greatly increase its exports to Southeast Asia in this fierce market struggle of life and death. In fact, Japan's trade with Southeast Asia has declined significantly this year. From January to May this year, exports decreased by 10% and imports decreased by 43.7% compared with the same period last year. Even the Japanese government admits that it is questionable whether it will achieve last year's export volume, let alone achieve this year's goal. Finally, the Kishi Nobusuke government's imperialist policy of reviving militarism internally and reviving the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" externally has aroused opposition from the Japanese people and the Asian people. In the new situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, if Japanese monopoly capital and its agent, the Kishi Nobusuke government, insist on going against the trend, the result will inevitably be a bloody nose and seeking its own destruction.

### 日本对东南亚的经济扩张

　　日本对东南亚的经济扩张
    张廷铮
    日本垄断资本现在正企图走帝国主义老路，急于对外实行经济扩张。它的扩张矛头首先是指向东南亚。
    日本出口市场的40％在亚洲，其中70％在东南亚。今年7月日本举行五大使会议，讨论对外扩张问题时，他们一致认为日本的繁荣和东南亚有“难解难分”的关系，从而主张“开发”经济不发达国家的工作要力求以东南亚为中心。而日本以扩大出口为中心的“新经济五年计划”（1958—1962年），又将出口计划的关键摆在东南亚，1962年对东南亚的出口将占日本出口总额的35％，其中仅机械一项即将占四分之一以上。也就是说，日本要在五年内将输出额提高一点九倍，而对东南亚却要扩大二点四倍。
    日本对东南亚进行经济扩张的目的是为了夺取廉价的原料基地和稳定的出口市场。尽管今年5月日本通商产业省发表的“经济合作白皮书”，曾列举种种理由，想要证明“经济合作”同过去的殖民政策有基本的不同，但结果还是露出了马脚：原来日本与东南亚国家进行经济合作的“基本政策”是为了“享受商业上的利益”，“出口资本货物、进口原材料”，并且还“必须适应日本经济发展的方向”。显然可见，这是道道地地的殖民政策，接受这样的“合作”，势将听任日本进行经济掠夺，变成它的销售市场和原料产地，从而也不可能建立自己独立的民族经济。
    “大东亚共荣圈”的翻版
    日本垄断资本从出生之日起，就是最具侵略性的。它的每一次发展几乎都是依靠侵略和战争。这一性质，在第二次世界大战后，也并未改变。在美国发动侵朝战争以前，日本垄断资本经过五年的努力，也未能使工业生产达到战前水平，可是朝鲜战争爆发后，由于日本起了侵朝美军的基地的作用，只经过四个月，工业生产就超过战前水平，并以此为基础获得了相当发展。由此可见，日本垄断资本在战前是依靠侵略战争起家，战后又是依靠战争横财而再起。正因为捞了这笔血腥的不义之财，增强了日本的经济力量，于是，日本垄断资本又妄想重温“大日本帝国”的旧梦，并选择了富于侵略经验的战犯岸信介来为它们执行这项任务。去年5月当岸信介秉承日本垄断资本的意旨赴东南亚进行第一次访问的时候，日本关西金融实业界的发言人、大阪商工会议所会长杉道助就曾说过，“没有恢复在东南亚的地位，就不能恢复日本在世界的地位”。这就可以看出，日本统治阶级决没有忘情于“大东亚共荣圈”，并且把复活日本帝国主义的梦想寄托在控制和开发东南亚身上。
    但要开发东南亚，必须有巨额的资金，日本虽有输出资本的愿望，却没有大量输出资本的能力。因此，这就出现了岸信介制定的企图利用美国资本、日本技术来“开发”东南亚资源的“东南亚开发基金计划”。去年11月2日出版的日本“经济学人”杂志评论说，这种想法是以美国老板为后台，由日本摆出“亚洲盟主”的姿态来从事东南亚的经济开发。其实这种想法也并不是什么新的东西，早在1954年吉田茂访问美国的时候，就曾提出过类似的所谓“亚洲经济合作局”计划，但因未得美国主子的青睐，只得作罢。
    岸信介的“东南亚开发基金计划”是帝国主义经济侵略的老手法，是复活“大东亚共荣圈”的具体步骤。连日本垄断资本御用的共同通讯社也承认它“无疑是这样的东西”（7月10日共同社电）。这个计划的范围非常广泛，其目的不仅是为日本扩大市场和掠夺原料开辟道路，并意味着日本要积极进行重新瓜分市场的斗争和建立它的势力范围，想借美国力量把英国、西德排挤出东南亚市场之外。
    可是岸信介的如意算盘落空了。东南亚国家看穿了这是“大东亚共荣圈”的翻版，表示冷淡或反对。岸信介自己也不能不承认东南亚国家怀疑“日本有特殊企图”。而美国也不愿意出钱恢复日本的“世界地位”，拱手让出东南亚市场。岸信介等待经年，美国始终“没有表示好意的态度”（岸信介的话），这对他以及日本垄断资本是一次沉重的打击。
    居然也要填补“真空”
    日本在失望之余，不得不依靠自己的力量在东南亚进行市场竞争，主要办法是战争赔偿、日元贷款、技术合作和私人投资。日本的赔债是物资赔债，因此对于日本垄断资本来说，不仅是最有利最可靠的商品输出，并且是进行经济扩张的重要手段。日本垄断资本已利用赔偿为缺乏销路的重工业产品开辟了新市场，还带动了出口贸易。1957年日本对东南亚的出口比1956年增加了一亿美元，其中70％系对菲律宾和缅甸的输出，而对菲、缅出口的增加，大部分是由于赔偿输出。近年来，日本机械设备能在菲、缅进口中占一席之地，也就是由于赔偿。这证明赔偿已成为日本夺取市场的有效武器。
    日本对东南亚的私人投资集中于它所缺乏的铁矿砂和有色金属方面。从1954年至1956年末止，日本铁矿砂的进口总量为一千八百三十万吨，其中七百四十万吨（26％）是由于对东南亚的投资而获得的。而铜矿石从1955年至1956年共进口三万六千四百吨，其中一万八千五百吨（50％强），也是由于对东南亚的投资而输入的。此外，日本对东南亚还以机械设备的输出抵偿原料的输入，这已为日本节约了八百一十万美元的外汇。
    但是日本的经济力量究属有限，于是它就集中力量首先争夺印度和印度尼西亚的市场。因此，日本在经济危机的情况下，竟贷款给印度五千万美元，而日本所设立的“东南亚开发合作基金”却仅只有一千五百万美元。今年日本还和印度签订了一个贸易协定，根据这个协定日本取得了最惠国的待遇，例如，日本人可以把利润汇出国外，可以自由进入印度和在印度境内居留，还享有汇款的权利。事实上印度已成为日本重工业产品的主要市场之一，去年，日本对印度的钢铁出口占其出口总额的26％，纺织机械占其出口总额的20.6％，铁道车辆占其出口总额的49％。
    印度尼西亚无论战前战后都是日本的主要市场。荷兰殖民者的势力被驱逐后，日本有野心取代荷兰在当地的经济地位。据日本“东洋经济新报”透露（2月8日号），在日本对印度尼西亚的赔偿和经济合作协定签字后，日本的垄断资本家认为“印度尼西亚不仅有橡胶、椰仁干、砂糖等农产品，还富有石油、锡、铁矾土等矿物资源。由于赶走了荷兰势力，产生了资本和技术的真空状态，因此，今天是日本乘机而入的好机会”。这同所谓填补中东“真空”的艾森豪威尔主义真是如出一辙，彻头彻尾暴露了日本垄断资本的帝国主义的真面目。
    但是据日本亚洲协会调查，日本每年对外投资力量目前仅约一亿二千万美元，每年对缅甸、菲律宾、印度尼西亚的赔偿额共约六千五百万美元，对东南亚各国的私人投资到去年年底止为一千九百万美元。欲以此戔戔之数独力开发东南亚实在很少可能。而美国对东南亚的投资在1955年底已达五亿三千四百万美元。英国对东南亚的投资在1954年底达七亿五千万美元。日本如不能取得美国的支持，不仅无法在东南亚实现其扩张的野心，而且有被美、英压倒的危险。因此，外务相藤山说，“日美合作”是日本外交政策的基础，日本同东南亚国家实行经济合作，必须以“日美合作”为出发点。这就是说，日本要充当美国对东南亚地区侵略政策的马前卒。不仅如此，日本还妄想干美国所没有做到的事。据北美新闻联合通信在去年6月27日报道，岸信介去年访美时，曾向美国政府首脑献策说：美国单独开发东南亚是有困难的，因为美国还被看做是殖民主义国家。如果日美合作，那么东南亚包括有民族主义倾向的国家在内，就可以使它们站在“自由主义阵营”方面来。而藤山在今年年初在印度尼西亚签订日本对印度尼西亚赔偿协定的时候，曾发起搞所谓“亚洲外长会议”，并且还说，“一定要把和平中立国家和东南亚条约反共国家联合起来才有意义”。岸信介和藤山阴谋把民族主义国家绑在美帝国主义的战车上，可见他们的居心是何等险恶。
    向美国摇尾乞怜
    岸信介的“东南亚开发基金计划”失败了，独力进行“开发”又不可能，而日本的经济危机却日益加深。第二次岸信介内阁为应付经济危机，拟竭尽全力进行资本输出，并乞求美国的支持。其主要办法是利用日元贷款和延期付款两种方式。但据日本经济企划厅估计，日本用日元贷款输出资本的能力，目前顶多不过一亿美元，而且这只有在国际收支有盈余的时候才有可能。因此，岸信介6月13日在记者招待会上向美国摇尾乞怜，他说，“在向东南亚输出方面，东南亚各国需要很多日本商品，但是没有钱，因此，延期付款方式可能采取。我想使美国同意这种想法，采取把过于集中在美国的美元分散的合理办法，来要求美国合作”。可是日本经济团体联合会会长石坂泰三去年访美试探后就认为这是不可能的，因为“美国毫无采纳的意思”。美元的集中是美国控制资本主义国家的最大法宝之一，只有在十分必要时，才略微施舍一点来延续它们的生命。美国并不认为日本垄断资本是忠实的同盟者，对它所采取的顶多也只能是吃不饱饿不死的政策。
    岸信介政府对东南亚进行经济扩张的前途是并不美妙的。首先，东南亚国家对第二次世界大战中日本帝国主义的侵略记忆犹新，因此，东南亚国家不会不警惕岸信介政府的阴谋并识破其潜在的帝国主义野心。其次，目前以美国为首的资本主义国家已陷入危机或者面临危机，都在扩大出口，减少进口，日本想在这场你死我活的激烈的市场斗争中，大大增加对东南亚的出口也很少可能。事实上，日本对东南亚的贸易今年已显著下降，今年1月至5月与去年同期相比较，出口减少了10％，进口减少了43.7％。连日本政府也承认要达到去年的出口额都成问题，更不要说达到今年的目标了。最后，岸信介政府这种对内复活军国主义，对外复活“大东亚共荣圈”的帝国主义政策，已引起了日本人民和亚洲人民的反对。在东风压倒西风的新形势下，日本垄断资本及其代理人岸信介政府如果硬要逆流而行，其结果必然是碰得头破血流，自寻绝路。
