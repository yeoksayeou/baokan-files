    Hebei Agricultural University Establishes Five "Satellite" Universities
    (From Hebei Daily) In order to cultivate talent for socialist construction for the country more, faster, better, and more economically, and to accelerate the popularization of higher education, Hebei Agricultural University has recently established five "satellite" agricultural universities in Anguo, Dingxian, Xushui, Lixian, and the suburban area of Baoding City.
    These five "satellite" agricultural universities were all established in cooperation with the Party committees of the respective counties (districts). These schools all adopt a half-work, half-study format, and the curriculum is adapted to local conditions and production needs, with a total of thirteen courses, including socialist education courses, Chinese language, physical education, botany and plant physiology, soil science, agricultural chemistry, crop cultivation and farming, seed selection and breeding, animal husbandry and disease prevention, agricultural mechanization, agricultural pests and diseases, afforestation, and physics and meteorology. Apart from socialist education, Chinese language, and physical education which are taught by teachers hired by the counties, the remaining courses are concurrently taught by professors from Hebei Agricultural University. The professors of Hebei Agricultural University will compile teaching materials based on the characteristics of crop planting in the province and counties, such as wheat in Anguo, sweet potatoes in Dingxian, and cotton in Xushui and Lixian. Without increasing its original teaching staff, Hebei Agricultural University gives full play to the teaching potential of its professors, sending them to various counties to give lectures in rotation. This not only solves the problem of teacher shortage in popularizing higher education but also enables teaching to be linked to practice and improves teaching quality. The study period for students is two years.

    学校办学校
    河北农业大学办五所“卫星”大学
    据河北日报消息　河北农业大学为了多快好省地给国家培养社会主义建设人才，加速普及高等教育，最近在安国、定县、徐水、蠡县和保定市郊区建立五所“卫星”农业大学。
    这五所“卫星”农业大学，都是和各县（区）党委共同协作建立的。这些学校都采取了半耕半读的形式，课程设置都适应了当地情况和生产需要，共有十三门课程，包括社会主义教育课程、语文、体育、植物及植物生理、土壤、农业化学、作物栽培和耕作、选种及良种繁育、家畜饲养及防治、农业生产机械化、农业病虫害、造林、物理及气象。除社会主义教育、语文、体育由县里聘请教师外，其余课程都由河北农业大学的教授兼任。河北农业大学的教授将根据本省和各县的农作物种植特点，如安国盛产小麦、定县盛产白薯，徐水、蠡县盛产棉花等，编写出讲义。河北农业大学原有的教学力量不增加，教授们充分发挥教学的潜力，分赴各县巡回讲授，这样，不但能给普及高等教育解决缺乏师资的问题，而且也能使教学联系实际，提高教学质量。学生学习期限为二年。
