    "Rejection"
    Fushi (Poem) Hua Junwu (Painting)

    Face turning green, neck turning red,
    Shaking all over, chest bursting with rage,
    Khrushchev reveals the pain,
    Squeezing out the pus from America.
    A bottle of ink jumps halfway,
    With a "slap," the palm swells,
    Documents dance on the desk,
    The President's hair is disheveled.
    Originally wanted to reply with a tough stance,
    But the facts cannot be refuted,
    The vicious appearance of a wolf is fully exposed,
    The sun sets, the road comes to an end.
    Eyes glaring like lanterns,
    Staring at the letter in a dark haze,
    Rumors and slanders have gone bankrupt,
    The gangster tactics are used in vain.

    “拒绝”
    俯拾 诗  华君武  画 脸色铁青脖子红，浑身发抖气破胸，赫鲁晓夫揭的痛，挤出美帝一身脓。一瓶墨水跳半空，啪的一声手掌肿，办公桌上文件舞，总统头发乱蓬松。本想回信来硬碰，奈何事实驳不动，豺狼凶相全暴露，日落天晚路途穷。两眼瞪的像灯笼，对着来信黑朦胧，造谣污蔑破了产，流氓手段耍一通。
