Small Scenes from Anti-American Demonstrations

    Protests on the Train
    The No. 43 express train from Shanghai to Lanzhou was speeding westward past Zhengzhou at 4:45 p.m. on the 11th. From the outside, this train looked no different from the many trains that passed by every day. But inside the carriages, the air was filled with protests against the military provocations of American imperialism. Every carriage was plastered with slogans such as "We must liberate Jinmen and Mazu!" and "We must liberate Taiwan!" The female announcer repeatedly broadcast Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait and related news to the passengers. After listening to the broadcast, a demobilized veteran of the Volunteer Army said indignantly, "For the American bandits to try to mess with us is like hitting a rock with an egg!" He stated that if the motherland needed him, he would return to the front line and once again deliver a fatal blow to the aggressors.
    A Grand Parade of Women and Children
    More than 4,000 street women in Changchun City, leading their children and carrying flags and placards, held a demonstration. A 66-year-old woman named Tang from Heshun Street, with already graying hair, also led her granddaughter-in-law to participate in the parade. The director of the street women's federation, seeing that she was so old, advised her not to participate, but she firmly said, "We want to liberate Taiwan, what business is it of the American devils? I must protest against the American bandits with you!" This parade of women and children kept shouting along the way, "American bandits get out of Taiwan!"
    Since hearing Premier Zhou's statement, the women of Changchun City have already taken action. More than 200 women from the Fifth Residents' Committee of Kuancheng District have dug out 16,000 catties of scrap iron and stated that they will produce more steel to strike at the American aggressors.
    The Determination of Cultural Relics Workers
    The American aggressors' provocations against our country have aroused great anger among cultural relics workers in Shaanxi Province, who have all expressed their determination to strike back at the aggressors with practical actions. They are determined to complete the work of adjusting four exhibition rooms, which was originally planned to be done by December of this year, ahead of schedule in September; and to add and expand three more exhibition rooms, including new people and new events, and porcelain, before National Day. Now the walls around the Shaanxi Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee are covered with murals about opposing American aggression and supporting the liberation of Taiwan. Cultural relics worker Zhang Minghui also wrote a poem: "American wolf, American wolf, new and old hatred, we will never forget; someday, we will settle this debt of hatred with you."
    The Practical Actions of Seamen
    17,000 seamen on the Sichuan River are using more loading, faster loading, more hauling, and faster running to support the three marshals of steel, machinery, and grain as a practical action to strike back at the military provocations of the American aggressors.
    The seamen of the Yangtze River No. 2017 vessel displayed soaring energy and proposed to push three large barges in continuous up and down water journeys along the entire Sichuan River, shortening the round trip time between Chongqing and Yichang to four days. Many workers in port operations have also continuously created new records in these days. After the workers of the Second Operations Area of Chongqing Port held a meeting, everyone plunged into intense combat, creating a new record of loading and unloading 10,523 tons, which is 1.3 times higher than the highest operating volume in August. Subsequently, the employees of the Jiulongpo Third Operations Area created an even higher record of loading and unloading more than 12,000 tons.
    Medical Teams Organized
    More than 3,000 teachers, students, and medical personnel of Zhongshan Medical College in Guangzhou were outraged when they heard the news of American warships invading our territorial waters and unanimously stated that they could not tolerate it. More than 30 staff members of the Systemic Surgery Department requested the Party committee to approve their formation of a medical team in order to be prepared to strike at the aggressors at any time. All the medical staff in the Department of Infectious Diseases and the Department of Neurology, as well as the school's administrative staff, also submitted this request to the Party committee. The Party committee approved their requests, and they formed two large medical teams in one night.
    Surgeons at the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital also automatically formed medical teams, surgical teams, rescue teams, and stretcher transport teams, ready to be called upon by the motherland at any time.

    反美示威运动中的小镜头
    列车上的抗议声
    由上海开往兰州的第四十三次直达快车，11日下午四时四十五分经郑州向西奔驰。从车外看，这列车同平时路过的许许多多列车没有什么不同；可是在车厢里面，这天却到处都沸腾着抗议美帝国主义对我国进行军事挑衅的声音。每个车厢里都贴上了“我们一定要解放金门、马祖！”“我们一定要解放台湾！”等标语，女播音员一遍又一遍地向旅客们播送周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明和一些有关的消息。一位志愿军复员军人听了广播以后激愤地说：“美国强盗想来碰我们，那简直是用鸡蛋来碰石头。”他表示，一旦祖国需要，他就重返前线，再一次给侵略者以致命的打击。
    妇孺大游行
    长春市四千多名街道妇女领着她们的孩子，拿着旗帜和标语牌，举行示威游行。和顺街一位六十六岁的姓唐的老太太，头发已经花白，也领着她的孙子媳妇参加游行。街道妇联主任看她年纪这样大，劝她不要参加了，她却坚决地说：“我们要解放台湾，管美国鬼子什么事？我一定要跟你们一起抗议美国强盗！”这一支妇孺组成的游行队伍，一路不断高呼：“美国强盗从台湾滚出去！”
    长春市妇女从听到周总理声明的广播后就已经行动起来，宽城区第五居民委员会的二百多名妇女，已经挖出一万六千斤废钢铁，并表示要生产更多的钢铁，以打击美国侵略者。
    文物工作者的决心
    美国侵略者对我国的挑衅行为激起了陕西省文物工作者的极大愤怒，他们都表示要以实际行动来回击侵略者。他们决心把原来计划到今年12月才做的调整四个陈列室的工作，提前到9月完成；并在国庆节以前再增加和扩充新人新事、陶瓷器等三个陈列室。现在陕西省文物管理委员会周围墙壁上，已经画满了有关反对美国侵略、支援解放台湾的壁画。文物工作者张铭惠还写了这样一首诗：“美国狼美国狼，新仇与旧恨，我们永远不能忘；终久有一天，要和你算清这笔仇恨账。”
    海员们的实际行动
    川江一万七千名海员正在用多装快装、多拉快跑以支援钢铁、机械和粮食三大元帅的实际行动来回击美国侵略者的军事挑衅。
    长江二○一七号轮的海员们发挥了冲天的干劲，提出要顶推三个大驳在川江连续上下水全程夜航，把重庆到宜昌间的往返时间缩短为四天。许多港湾作业的工人们这几天也连续创造了新纪录。重庆港第二作业区的工人们在集会以后，个个投入紧张的战斗，创造了装卸一万零五百二十三吨的新纪录，比8月份最高作业量提高了一点三倍。接着，九龙坡第三作业区职工又创造了装卸一万二千多吨的更高纪录。
    医疗队组织起来了
    广州中山医学院三千多名师生和医护人员，听到美国军舰侵入我国领海的消息后，群情激愤，一致表示不能容忍。系统外科三十多名工作人员为了准备好随时可以打击侵略者，到党委会请求批准他们组成医疗队。传染病科和神经科的全体医护人员以及学校的行政工作人员，也纷纷向党委提出这个请求。党委批准了他们的请求，他们在一个晚上就组成了两个医疗大队。
    广东省人民医院的外科医生们也自动组成了医疗队、手术队、救护队、担架运输队等，准备随时听候祖国的召唤。
