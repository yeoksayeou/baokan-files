    Forcing the Kishi Government to Change its Reactionary Policies
    Japanese Socialist Party Decides to Strengthen Struggle
    Public Opinion Poll Shows Nobusuke Kishi Increasingly Unpopular
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 25th: The Japanese Socialist Party decided today that during the upcoming extraordinary Diet session on September 29th, it will struggle to force the Kishi Nobusuke government to fulfill its promises and revise its policies on diplomacy, economy, culture and education, and labor.
    This decision was made at an emergency meeting of the Socialist Party's chairman and directors in Sapporo, Hokkaido. The meeting studied the specific policies of the Socialist Party in its struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government at the extraordinary Diet session.
    The Socialist Party will propose to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi deliver a policy speech at the beginning of the extraordinary Diet session, and will also request that Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, Finance Minister Eisaku Sato, and Economic Planning Agency Director Takeo Miki report on diplomatic and economic issues respectively. The Socialist Party will raise questions on these issues.
    The Socialist Party also decided to file a motion of no confidence against Minister of Education Hirokichi Nadao. Nadao bears direct responsibility for the "performance rating" system forcibly promoted by the Kishi Nobusuke government.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 26th: According to a report in the "Asahi Shimbun" today, a "public opinion poll" conducted by the newspaper across Japan on September 17th and 18th shows that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is becoming increasingly unpopular.
    The "Asahi Shimbun" said that among those who participated in the survey, 30% demanded the replacement of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, while only 34% supported the cabinet, including the 9% who did not state the reasons for their support.

    迫使岸政府改变反动政策
    日本社会党决定加强斗争
    民意测验表明岸信介日益不得人心
    新华社25日讯  东京消息：日本社会党今天决定，在即将于9月29日召开的国会临时会议期间，社会党将为迫使岸信介政府履行诺言，修改它的外交、经济、文教和劳工等政策进行斗争。
    这个决定是在北海道札幌市举行的社会党委员长和局长紧急会议上作出的。这次会议研究了社会党在国会临时会议上同岸信介政府进行斗争的具体方针。
    社会党将向执政的自由民主党提出，要日本首相岸信介在国会临时会议开始时作施政方针的演说，同时要求外务相藤山爱一郎、藏相佐藤荣作、经济企划厅长宫三木武夫分别报告外交和经济问题。社会党将就这些问题提出质询。
    社会党还决定对文部相滩尾弘吉提出不信任案。滩尾对岸信介政府强迫推行的“勤务评定”制度负有直接责任。
    据新华社26日讯  东京消息：据“朝日新闻”今天报道，这家报纸9月17日和18日在日本全国举行的“民意测验”表明，岸信介内阁越来越不得人心。
    “朝日新闻”说，在参加测验的人中，有30％要求撤换岸信介内阁，而支持这个内阁的、包括没有说出支持的理由的9％在内，只有34％。
