Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 29th. From September 19th to 28th, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, inspected work in Jiangsu Province, accompanied by Comrade Hui Yuyu, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and Governor, Comrade Chen Guang, Secretary, Comrade Sun Jiano, Minister of Rural Work, and responsible comrades from various local and municipal Party committees. During the inspection, Comrade Liu Shaoqi offered important opinions on issues related to industry, agriculture, water conservancy, education, and labor systems. During his inspection in Nanjing, he listened to work reports from Comrade Jiang Weiqing, First Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, and Comrades Liu Shunyuan, Hui Yuyu, and Chen Guang, Secretaries. He also met with leaders of the troops stationed in Nanjing, the Military Academy, and responsible cadres of provincial-level organs.

During the ten-day inspection, Comrade Liu Shaoqi traveled extensively through many cities and villages, both north and south of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu, passing through the special districts of Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Yangzhou, Nantong, Suzhou, and inspecting the cities and counties of Xuzhou, Xin Hai Lian, Xinyi, Shuyang, Huaiyin, Gaoyou, Yangzhou, Nantong, Changshu, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Nanjing, covering thousands of miles. During this inspection, Comrade Shaoqi extensively contacted cadres and workers and peasants at all levels. In addition to listening to reports from the secretaries of the seven special districts and two municipal Party committees, he also met with most of the county Party secretaries in the special districts. Along the way, he also visited several people's communes and steel mills, machine factories, and silk factories. In Nanjing, he visited the Nanjing Institute of Technology. He held cordial talks with workers and peasants beside high-yield experimental fields and blast furnaces. In the Dingji People's Commune in Huaiyin, Comrade Shaoqi personally participated in deep plowing work with the commune members. All these activities of our Party Central Committee leaders in Jiangsu Province left an unforgettable impression on the people and brought great encouragement to the 40 million people of Jiangsu Province. Comrade Shaoqi's instructions on how to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, how to build a beautiful communist life, and how to cultivate the communist spirit of the people opened up a broad vision for everyone and added tremendous spiritual strength.

Fewer Plantings, Better Planting, and More Harvests is a Fundamental Issue in Agricultural Economy

During the inspection, Comrade Liu Shaoqi learned about the agricultural production situation in Jiangsu Province. He carefully viewed the high-yield experimental fields of middle rice, late rice, and sweet potatoes in various places. In the Heping People's Commune in Changshu County, Comrade Shaoqi visited the four-mu experimental field in Fengchan Wei. He personally bent down to count the rice plants and asked the township Party secretary, "How much can you harvest?" The answer was, "We can harvest 10,000 catties." Comrade Shaoqi said with a smile, "Can 10,000 catties be more? Your conditions here are good. If you do more deep plowing, you can harvest more." When he was in a symposium with comrades from the Huaiyin Prefectural Committee, he said: "When I inspected Hebei and Henan, some county Party secretaries believed that planting less and harvesting more would save more than planting extensively and harvesting thinly, and that the experience of high-yield fields should be promoted to concentrate manpower and material resources to cultivate the land well. In this way, after a few more years, we can use one-third of the land to grow food, one-third to plant trees, and one-third for leisure." He also said, "Planting less, planting well, but harvesting more, this is a fundamental issue in agricultural economics. I hope that all localities will carefully calculate the accounts and seriously study this issue."

Comrade Liu Shaoqi was also very concerned about water conservancy projects in Jiangsu Province. In Huaiyin Prefecture, he continuously viewed three water gate projects - the Erhe Gate, the Sanhe Gate, and the Gaoliangjian Intake Gate of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, and carefully studied the overall plan of water conservancy in Huaiyin Prefecture. He repeatedly asked Comrade Sun Zhenhua, First Secretary of the Huaiyin Prefectural Committee, whether the Sanhe Gate could be used to generate electricity? Can it be used for shipping? He said: "Water can be a disaster, but it can also be beneficial. We must turn water disasters into water benefits and make full use of all water. When building a water conservancy project, we must consider how to combine irrigation, flood control, transportation, power generation, etc. This is the biggest saving." On the way from Huaiyin to Hangzhou, the car drove south along the canal embankment. Regarding the Grand Canal project, which is about to start construction for dredging and development, Comrade Shaoqi asked again: "Is it possible to combine inland waterway transportation with ocean transportation? If the canal is widened and deepened so that large ships of 5,000 tons can directly enter the canal from the sea, then Jiangsu's goods can be directly loaded onto ships for export, and goods from the Northeast can be directly imported without having to load and unload in Shanghai, which will save a lot of transportation costs."

Labor Shortage Proves Our Country Is Undergoing Great Development; Doing Five Things Well Will Greatly Change Social Mores

In reports from various localities, many comrades mentioned the tight labor situation. Comrade Shaoqi said: Although the tight labor situation has brought some difficulties to everyone's work, it should be considered a good thing. The fact that we feel a tight labor situation in our large country with a population of over 600 million proves that our industrial and agricultural production is developing greatly and the national economy is prospering rapidly. Under this situation, we should do five things well: First, we must enable all people in society to participate in labor within their capabilities; Second, we must thoroughly liberate women from tedious housework; Third, we must carry out large-scale technological reforms, reform various labor tools, and improve labor efficiency; Fourth, we must improve social labor organization. For example, the transformation of smaller agricultural cooperatives into large-scale people's communes, implementing "military organization, combat action, and collectivized life," is a major improvement in rural labor organization. This improvement greatly facilitates the allocation of rural labor and greatly facilitates the development of agricultural productivity. For another example, implementing the "male and female shift rotation, old and young shift rotation" proposed by Zhengzhou, so that things that women can do are no longer done by men, and things that the elderly can do are no longer done by young and middle-aged people, so that men, women, old and young can each undertake the work they are capable of; Fifth, develop versatile people with multiple skills and improve the cultural and technical level of workers. Doing these five things well will not only solve the difficulty of labor shortage, but also fundamentally change the entire social atmosphere, the social labor system, and labor organization.

Implementing the Grain Supply System Will Enhance the People's Communist Consciousness

Comrade Shaoqi was very concerned about the issue of people's communes implementing the grain supply system. Many people's communes in Jiangsu Province will implement the grain supply system after this year's autumn harvest. When Comrade Shaoqi visited the Heping People's Commune in Changshu County, he asked the township Party secretary: "After the autumn, the implementation of the grain supply system, do the masses support it?" The township Party secretary quickly replied: "Everyone jumped up with joy when they heard that they didn't have to pay for food. An old man said that he used to worry about suffering all his life and being unable to eat enough. Now it's great." Comrade Chu Jiang, First Secretary of the Suzhou Prefectural Committee, said in his report: "The masses are very much in favor of implementing the grain supply system. They say: 'One thought is gone, and another thought has come.' The thought that is gone is the bitter thought of worrying about food and clothing for thousands of years, and the thought that has come is how to make production better, otherwise they will be sorry for the Communist Party." Comrade Shaoqi found these two sentences of the masses very interesting. He said: "These two sentences, two thoughts, are worthy of our deep thought. Some people worry that the implementation of the grain supply system will increase lazy people? These two sentences from the farmers in Suzhou give us the most powerful answer. This shows that they have not become lazy, but their emotions are even higher and their production is more active. This is a manifestation of the people's communist consciousness and a sign of even greater improvement in communist moral qualities. Lenin once said: Communist labor is voluntary labor, is unlimited labor, is labor that does not expect rewards and has no reward conditions. People always do more and better, regardless of the amount of remuneration and whether there is a quota. When all the people develop such labor habits and labor attitudes, individual lazy people will be completely isolated and will be regarded by everyone as very immoral people. Everyone will look down on him, and he will inevitably transform and participate in collective labor. Only by thoroughly realizing communism can we thoroughly eliminate lazy people."

Combine Factories and Schools to Integrate Education and Productive Labor

In talks with the secretaries of various localities, cities, and counties, Comrade Shaoqi repeatedly expounded on the socialist education system and labor system. He said that the socialist education system is the combination of education and productive labor. One of the most thorough ways to implement this system is to combine factories and schools. In the past, schools were separate and factories were separate, with no connection. In the future, the two sets can be gradually combined into one. Building a new factory is also building a new school. The labor department and the education department jointly recruit new members, which is both recruiting workers and recruiting students. After entering the factory, train for three or four months, operate the machine, work for four hours or six hours a day, and read books for four hours or three hours, half-work and half-study, and can study from junior high school all the way to university graduation. Implementing this method will greatly shorten the process of intellectualizing workers and peasants, and will enable the difference between mental labor and physical labor to be eliminated more quickly; the intellectuals cultivated in this way will be working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi also emphasized that while our factories are producing material products such as steel, machinery, and electricity, they should also be responsible for cultivating new people with cultural knowledge and labor skills - builders of communism. Universities, technicians, engineers, and cadres should come out of the factory. The factory director and the Party committee secretary should take the responsibility of building a new communist society and also take the responsibility of cultivating communist builders.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi repeatedly praised the practice of various localities organizing large numbers of "expedition teams" from the communes to go to the mountains to mine and to cities to make steel. He said: "Now the local iron and steel smelting, ore mining, and water conservancy construction are all carried out by launching mass movements. Everyone brings their own tools, prepares their own food, or implements the grain supply system, or a semi-supply and semi-wage system. This method is very good. Thousands or tens of thousands of people are concentrated in an iron and steel base. They build a shed and sleep next to the furnace. Although life is very hard, they are very motivated. This is a communist spirit and the bud of a new labor wage system. It has opened up a brand new path for the labor system of our new factories in the future."

    少奇同志视察江苏城乡
    对工业、农业、教育和劳动制度等工作提出重要意见
    新华社南京29日电  9月19日到28日，中共中央副主席、全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长刘少奇同志，在中共江苏省委书记、省长惠浴宇同志，书记陈光同志，农村工作部部长孙加诺同志以及各地、市委负责同志的分别陪同下，在江苏省视察工作。视察期间，刘少奇同志对工业、农业、水利、教育和劳动制度等方面的一些问题提出了重要的意见。在南京视察期间，听取了中共江苏省委第一书记江渭清同志，书记刘顺元、惠浴宇、陈光同志等的工作汇报，接见了驻南京部队、军事学院的首长和省级机关的负责干部。
    在十天的视察期间，刘少奇同志走遍了江苏长江南北的许多城市和乡村，途经徐州、淮阴、扬州、南通、苏州等专区，视察了徐州、新海连、新沂、沭阳、淮阴、高邮、扬州、南通、常熟、苏州、无锡、南京等市县，连续行程达数千里。在这次视察中，少奇同志广泛地接触了各级干部和工农群众，除听取了全省七个专区和两个市的地、市委书记汇报外，并接见了各专区的大部分县委书记，沿途还看了好几个人民公社和钢铁厂、机厂、丝绸厂，在南京访问了南京工学院，在丰产试验田和高炉旁边和工人、农民作了亲切的谈话。在淮阴的丁集人民公社，少奇同志还亲自和社员们一起参加了深翻土地的劳动。我们党中央的领导同志在江苏省的这一切活动，给人民留下了难忘的印象，给江苏省四千万人民带来了很大的鼓舞。少奇同志关于如何贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，关于如何建设美好的共产主义生活以及培养人民共产主义精神的提示，给大家打开了广阔的眼界，增添了巨大的精神力量。
    种得少  种得好  收得多是农业经济一个根本问题
    在视察中，刘少奇同志了解江苏省农业生产的情况，他非常仔细地观看了各地中稻、晚稻和山芋的丰产试验田。在常熟县和平人民公社，少奇同志参观了丰产圩的四亩试验田，他亲自弯下身子去数了一下稻棵，并且问乡党委书记：“可以打多少？”回答说：“可以打一万斤”，少奇同志笑着说：“一万斤还能再多吗？你们这里条件好，再搞一搞深翻，还能多打些。”他在和淮阴地委的同志们座谈时说：“我在河北、河南视察的时候，有些县委书记认为少种多收比广种薄收要节省的多，应该把丰产田的经验推广，集中使用人力和物力来种好田地。这样再过几年，就可以用三分之一的地种粮食，三分之一植树，三分之一休闲。”他又说：“种得少，种得好，但是收得多，这是农业经济上一个带根本性的问题，希望各地好好算一算账，认真研究一下这个问题。”
    对于江苏省的水利工程，刘少奇同志也非常关心。在淮阴专区，他一连看了三个水闸工程——二河闸、三河闸和苏北灌溉总渠的高良涧进水闸，并且仔细研究了淮阴专区的水利规划总体图。他一再问淮阴地委第一书记孙振华同志，三河闸能不能利用来发电？能不能搞航运？他说：“水能为患，也能成利，我们要变水患为水利，把水都充分地利用起来。搞一个水利工程，要考虑怎样把灌溉、防洪、运输、发电等结合起来，这就是最大的节约。”在离开淮阴到杭州去的路上，汽车沿运河堤岸南行，对于即将开始动工疏浚开拓的大运河工程，少奇同志又问：“是否可以把内河航运和海洋运输结合起来。如果把运河拖宽挖深，使五千吨的大船能够由海直接进入运河，这样，江苏的东西就可以直接装船出口，东北来的东西也可以直接入口，不需要再到上海去装卸，这将节省很大一笔运输费用。”
    劳力紧张证明我国在大发展作好五件事使社会风气大变
    在各地的汇报中，许多同志都提到劳动力紧张的情况。少奇同志说：劳动力紧张虽然给大家的工作带来了一些困难，但是应该认为这是一种好事情，在我们六亿多人口的大国中感到了劳动力紧张，证明我国的工农业生产正在大发展，国民经济正在一日千里地繁荣起来。在这种形势下，我们应该做好五件事：第一、要使社会上所有的人都参加力所能及的劳动；第二、彻底地把妇女从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来；第三、大规模地进行技术改革，改革各种劳动工具，提高劳动效率；第四、改善社会的劳动组织。例如，规模较小的农业合作社转变成规模很大的人民公社，实行“组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化”，农村劳动组织大进一步的改进，这种改进大大有利于农村劳动力的调配，大大有利于农业生产力的发展。又例如，实行郑州提出的“男女换班、老少换班”，即使女人能做的事不再由男人去做，使老年人能做的事不再由青年和壮年去做，以便男女老少能够各自担任自己力能胜任的工作；第五、发展多面手，一人多艺，提高劳动者的文化技术水平。做好这五件事，不仅可以解决劳动力紧张的困难，而且将会使整个社会的风气、社会的劳动制度、劳动组织发生根本的变化。
    实行粮食供给制以后将提高人民共产主义觉悟
    少奇同志非常关心人民公社实行粮食供给制的问题，江苏省不少人民公社在今年秋收后，即将实行粮食供给制。少奇同志在访问常熟县和平人民公社时，问乡党委书记：“秋后实行粮食供给制，群众拥护不拥护？”乡党委书记连忙接上来说：“大家一听说吃饭不要钱，都高兴得跳起来了，有个老头说，过去担心受苦一辈子，怕吃不饱肚子，这下子可好了。”苏州地委第一书记储江同志在汇报时说：“群众都非常赞成实行粮食供给制，他们说：‘一个心思丢下了，一个心思又来了。’丢下的是几千年愁吃愁穿的苦心思，又来的心思是怎样把生产搞得更好，不然就对不起共产党。”少奇同志对群众的这两句话，感到很有意思，他说：“这两句话，两个心思，很值得我们深思。有人担心，实行粮食供给制，会不会增加懒人？苏州的农民的这两句话，给我们作了最有力的回答。这说明他们不是变懒了，而是情绪更加高了，生产更积极了。这就是人民的共产主义觉悟提高的表现，是共产主义道德品质更加提高的标志。列宁曾说过：共产主义的劳动是自愿的劳动，是无定额的劳动，是不指望报酬、没有报酬条件的劳动。人们不管报酬多少，不管有没有定额，他们总是做得更多更好。全体人民都养成了这样的劳动习惯和劳动态度，个别的懒人就会完全孤立，会被大家看成很没有道德的人，大家都瞧不起他，他也就势必会改造过来，参加集体的劳动。只有彻底地实现共产主义，才能彻底的消灭懒汉。”
    把工厂和学校合起来办使教育和生产劳动结合
    在与各地、市、县委书记的谈话中，少奇同志反复地阐述了社会主义的教育制度和劳动制度的问题。他说，社会主义的教育制度就是教育和生产劳动相结合，贯彻这个制度最彻底的办法之一是把工厂和学校合起来办。过去是学校一套，工厂一套，互不相干，以后可以逐步地把两套合成一套。新办一个工厂，也就是新办一个学校，由劳动部门和教育部门联合招收新成员，既是招工人，又是招学生。入厂后，先训练三、四个月，上机器操作，每天作四小时或六小时工作，读四小时或三小时书，半工半读，可以从初中一直读到大学毕业。实行这种办法，将使工农群众知识分子化的过程能够大大缩短，使脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别能够更快消除；这样培养出来的知识分子，将是又红又专的工人阶级的知识分子。
    刘少奇同志还强调指出，我们的工厂在生产钢铁、机器、电力等等物质产品的同时，还应该负责培养有文化知识有劳动本领的新人——共产主义的建设者。工厂里应该出大学生、出技师、出工程师、出干部。工厂的厂长、党委书记要负起建设共产主义新社会的责任，也要负起培养共产主义建设者的责任。
    刘少奇同志一再赞扬各地从公社里组织大批“远征队”上山采矿，到城市炼钢铁的做法。他说：“现在各地方炼钢铁、采矿石、修水利都是采取大搞群众运动的办法，各人自带工具，自备粮食，或者实行粮食供给制，或者是半供给半工资制，这办法很好，一个钢铁基地就集中了几千几万人，他们搭一个棚子睡在炉子旁边，生活虽很苦，干劲却很大，这是一种共产主义的精神，是新的劳动工资制度的萌芽，它给我们今后新办工厂的劳动制度开辟了一条崭新的道路。”
