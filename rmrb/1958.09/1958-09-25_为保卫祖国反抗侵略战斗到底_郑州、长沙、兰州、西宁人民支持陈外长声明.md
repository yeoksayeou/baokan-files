Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 22nd: People from all walks of life in Zhengzhou warmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev's warning to Eisenhower.

Yesterday, as workers in various workshops of the Zhengzhou No. 3 State-owned Cotton Factory left their machines, they gathered to hold meetings. Li Xueyi, a worker in the cleaning workshop, said angrily that U.S. imperialism has occupied our territory of Taiwan, and Dulles is even turning black and white, saying we are the "aggressors." This is simply like a mad dog biting people indiscriminately.

All members of the Zhengzhou North Suburb People's Commune resolutely support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement with practical actions. Liu Shouchong, the commune's director, said at a forum that in order to support the liberation of Taiwan, we have decided to increase the plan to deep-plow 1,200 mu of land to 1,500 mu, and increase the plan to apply 80,000 jin of base fertilizer to 100,000 jin, using the "satellite" of high-yield grain to smash the American bandits to death.

Wu Shaokui, Vice President of Henan Agricultural College, said angrily that U.S. imperialism is really bullying people too much. I am already over fifty years old. If the American aggressors insist on imposing war on us, I am willing to be the first to sign up and go to the front lines.

Huang Jicai, a Taiwanese compatriot participating in socialist construction in Zhengzhou, said that we yearn for the liberation of Taiwan, just like children longing for their mothers. But U.S. imperialism slanders our liberation of our own territory of Taiwan as "aggression," which is truly shameless. In order to liberate Taiwan, I am willing to contribute everything I have.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 22nd: The people of Changsha warmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and angrily refute U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' speech at the United Nations General Assembly.

Li Zhengming, a worker at the Changsha Water Pump Factory, said: The warmonger Dulles said that our liberation of our own territory is "aggression," which is complete nonsense. No matter how the aggressors distort the truth, our determination to liberate our own territory of Jinmen and Mazu, and to liberate Taiwan, will never waver. All the workers in this factory guarantee to work hard for ten days, refining 300 tons of steel and manufacturing 50 water pumps, using practical actions to accelerate industrial construction to strike at the American aggressors.

After seeing Foreign Minister Chen's statement in the newspaper, the militiamen of the Wannianhong People's Commune in the suburbs of Changsha immediately made a guarantee that while doing a good job in production, they would strive to learn shooting techniques and strive to reach the standard of excellent sharpshooters in a short period. Officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Changsha stated: If the American aggressors feel that the lessons they learned on the Korean battlefield are not enough, and they insist on provoking war, we will resolutely give them another lesson.

The responsible persons of the democratic parties in Changsha also stated one after another that they would further mobilize the members of the democratic parties in the city, accelerate self-transformation, do a good job in their respective positions, and do a good job in the current double-contribution movement of offering suggestions and efforts, in order to support the struggle to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and liberate Taiwan with practical actions.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, September 23rd: People from all walks of life in Lanzhou, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, unanimously support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's solemn statement and are determined to fight to the end to defend the motherland and resist aggression.

The upsurge of opposition to U.S. imperialist aggression among all workers in Lanzhou is even higher, and they are using even greater production achievements to respond to Dulles's ravings. The employees of the Gansu Agricultural Tool Manufacturing Factory, who guard the steel-making furnace day and night, have built four converters in the past three days, and two of them have been put into production. The Lanzhou Machine Parts Factory has established a militia battalion. Members of the people's communes in the suburbs of Lanzhou stated: U.S. imperialism must get out of Taiwan. Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement is our attitude. The Yantan People's Commune immediately made specific plans for agricultural production next year, ensuring that the target of 200,000 jin of vegetables per mu will be overfulfilled next year, and using a bumper harvest to strike at U.S. imperialism.

On the 21st, the democratic parties in Lanzhou also held meetings and issued statements, unanimously condemning the aggressive acts and absurd remarks of U.S. imperialism that turned black and white.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, September 23rd: In recent days, people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Xining have held gatherings to support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's solemn statement and Comrade Khrushchev's warning to Eisenhower. They angrily condemned Dulles's shameless ravings that slandered our country's "aggression," pointing out that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands is entirely an exercise of their sovereignty, and the United States is not allowed to interfere. The American bandits must get out of the Taiwan Strait.

The workers of the Xining Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Machinery Factory, who have been watching the U.S. aggressors set fires in the Taiwan region, gave up their Sunday holiday on the 21st and decided to strive to put a steelmaking workshop with an annual output of 10,000 tons into production ahead of schedule. The two and a half-ton steelmaking converters, which the fitter workshop originally planned to manufacture on the 24th, were manufactured ahead of schedule yesterday afternoon and fully installed. The workers in the foundry workshop stated that they would cast 30 sets of hot blast pipes for blast furnaces before the 25th to support steel production and fight back against the American aggressors.

At a meeting held by teachers and students of Qinghai Nationalities College, young Mongolian, Tibetan, and Tu ethnic herders from the grasslands stated: We are good at riding horses and hunting wolves on the grasslands. Once the motherland calls, we guarantee to ride fast, one shot, one kill, and eliminate all the invaders.
