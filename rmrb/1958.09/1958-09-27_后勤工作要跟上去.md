Logistics Work Must Keep Up
Fan Sui

When talking about vigorously developing the iron and steel industry, people often like to use the saying "troops and horses haven't moved, but supplies go first" to emphasize the importance of transportation, ensuring that small blast furnaces have enough "supplies"—ore and coking coal—to produce more iron. In fact, it is not only small blast furnaces that need supplies on the iron and steel front, but also thousands upon thousands of iron smelting workers. The iron and steel warriors in various places did not set out to the mountains after "supplies going first," but instead went straight to the mines with their own rations. As the days go by, a few days' worth of rations are no longer sufficient to meet the needs of long-term combat. Therefore, how to quickly establish a logistics supply network near the mine furnace clusters has become an urgent task for the commercial departments.

To focus on logistics, the most important thing is to rely on the masses. During the great War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, when the People's Liberation Army fought against Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's army with millions of troops, we relied on the broad masses of the people to establish a strong supply line and finally win the final victory. Now, on the iron and steel front, we have gathered a labor army of tens of millions. Without the participation of the broad masses in the logistics supply work for so many people, it would be difficult to do well by relying solely on a small number of commercial cadres. Sichuan Province adopted the experience of doing logistics work during the war years, mobilizing 600,000 commercial employees throughout the province, establishing logistics headquarters, dividing them into teams and groups, assigning areas of responsibility, and closely cooperating with nearby agricultural cooperatives to establish supply points in small blast furnace cluster areas to ensure that iron and steel workers are "well-fed and warmly clothed." This approach is worth learning from in various places.

To focus on logistics, one must have political foresight and see far ahead. Our iron and steel production is not a short-term blitz, but a long-term war of attrition. With the continuous establishment of iron and steel bases, the demand for grain, cooking oil, pork, medicine, clothing, shoes, and other items needed by the iron and steel warriors has also risen sharply. The once-remote mountainous areas have now become noisy battlefields. The original lack of banks, post offices, newspapers, cultural goods, etc., now makes it increasingly apparent that corresponding measures must be taken in these areas to catch up with actual needs. It is hoped that commercial departments, with the spirit of iron and steel being above all else, will care for those tens of thousands of warriors and do a good job in logistics supply work.

    后勤工作要跟上去
    范眭
    说起大办钢铁工业，人们常常喜欢用兵马未动粮草先行的话来强调交通运输的重要，让小高炉有足够的“粮草”——矿石、焦煤，生产出更多的铁来。其实，钢铁战线上需要粮草的除了小高炉以外，还有成千上万的炼铁工人。各地的钢铁战士大都不是“粮草先行”才上山，而是自带干粮直奔矿山的。时间一天天过去，几天的干粮储备已经不能适应长期战斗的需要。因此，怎样做到很快地在矿山炉群的附近建立起后勤供应网，就成为商业部门的一项紧急任务。
    抓后勤，最重要的就是依靠群众。在伟大的抗日战争和解放战争中，当人民解放军百万大军和日本帝国主义、蒋介石军队作战时，我们曾经依靠广大人民，建立了强大的供应线，终于获得最后胜利。现在，我们在钢铁战线上，聚集了数以千万计的劳动大军，对于这样多人的后勤供应工作，如果没有广大群众参加，光是依靠少数商业干部，是很难做好的。四川省采用过去战争时期做后勤工作的经验，把全省六十万商业从业人员动员起来，建立后勤指挥部，分成若干个队、组，划片包干，和附近各个农业社密切协作，在小高炉群地区设立起供应点，保证钢铁工人“吃饱穿暖”，这种作法是值得各地学习的。
    抓后勤，要有政治预见，看得远。我们的钢铁生产不是短期的突击战，是长期的持久战。随着钢铁基点的不断建立，钢铁战士需要的粮食、食油、猪肉、医药、衣服、鞋子等需要量也骤然上升；原来素称闭塞的山区，现在变成了喧嚣的战场；原来没有银行、邮局、书报文化用品等设置，现在愈来愈觉得这些方面的工作也要采取相应的措施，赶上实际的需要。希望商业部门以钢铁高于一切的精神，关心那些成千上万的战士，作好后勤供应工作。
