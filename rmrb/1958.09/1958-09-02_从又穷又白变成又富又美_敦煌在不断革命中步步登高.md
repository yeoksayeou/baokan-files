From Poor and White to Rich and Beautiful
　　Dunhuang Ascends Step by Step in Continuous Revolution
　　By our reporter Hu Jiwei

Editor's Note: After a year of hard work, many areas that were once poor and white will become rich and beautiful. When they were poor and white, they had great enthusiasm. After they become rich and beautiful, as long as they grasp the guiding ideology of continuous revolution, their enthusiasm will become even greater. The old achievements will become the beginning of new achievements, and it will encourage the people to move from one victory to even greater victories with more confidence. Therefore, timely summarizing the experiences of how the Party Committee leads these rich and beautiful areas to continue to move forward is of great significance for striving for a greater leap forward next year. The situation in Dunhuang County, Gansu, introduced here is worth considering.

Poor and white, soaring enthusiasm. After going from poor and white to rich and beautiful through hard work, will the enthusiasm slack off? This has been the case in many places in the past. We should naturally deeply remember this lesson and always be vigilant about this danger. We believe that we will definitely be able to prevent and overcome this shortcoming in time. Victory naturally easily makes people complacent, but for us communists, victory is mainly the driving force for greater victory and the starting point for new victory.

It should be seen that victory has the possibility of turning into its opposite. Intentional or unintentional complacency and slackening of efforts will make the advanced become the backward in the great leap forward. Some wealthy areas that have had bumper harvests of wheat for many years originally thought that they would still sit in the first place in terms of wheat production this year, and did not work hard and practically in every possible way like other areas. Although they also greatly increased production this year, and even compared to their own past, it was still an unprecedented increase, but this is already old news, an old comparison method. If compared with the leap forward development of other regions, they can only admit defeat. This is one type of area. There is another type of area, which has had bumper harvests of wheat for many years, is rich and beautiful, and continues to make rapid progress this year, winning the championship. Dunhuang County, Gansu Province, is an excellent example of this type of area. It is one of the two wheat thousand-jin counties in China this year (the other is Hezheng, also in Gansu), and is the county with the highest income for the people in Gansu Province.

A Small County on the Gobi Desert Builds a Fortune Through Hard Work and Becomes Rich and Beautiful

Dunhuang is a world-renowned place because its Mogao Caves are a treasure trove of Chinese art. However, it is a small county of 80,000 people outside Jiayuguan. 89% of the land is Gobi and desert, with only 230,000 mu of cultivated land, and more than 5 million mu of arable wasteland. It almost never rains here all year round, with an average annual rainfall of only 44.7 millimeters. However, it is the westernmost part of the Hexi Corridor, with flat and fertile land, and all cultivated land can be irrigated by snow water from the Qilian Mountains. The frost-free period averages 117 days, and the sunshine is particularly abundant (300 to 333 hours of sunshine per month from May to September). Since liberation, cotton and grain have had bumper harvests here almost every year. Last year, wheat yield was 408 jin per mu, and cotton yield was 105.5 jin of ginned cotton per mu; the people's income was very high. Last year, the gross income per agricultural person was 277 yuan, and the net income was 193 yuan, which was more than double the income of the local wealthy middle peasants. After becoming a cotton and wheat double-thousand-jin county this year, the average gross income per agricultural person will reach more than 750 yuan. After greatly expanding public accumulation this year, the net income per person will also be around 300 yuan, which exceeds the income of general urban workers and general cadres.

Dunhuang also started from poor and white conditions through hard work. At the time of liberation, this small county surrounded by the Gobi and desert had only 42,000 people and 90,000 mu of cultivated land. Cotton yielded only 28 jin per mu, and wheat yielded only 130 jin per mu. At that time, the people were hungry and cold, and even big girls in their teens could not afford pants. 27% of the farmers relied on state relief to survive. Under the leadership of the county party committee, after four or five years of hard work by the people, production developed rapidly. In 1955, the second year of the county's advanced cooperativization, there were bumper harvests of five major items: grain, cotton, lake grass (pasture), vegetables, and melons and fruits. In particular, the cotton fields expanded from more than 17,000 mu to more than 53,000 mu, and the yield of ginned cotton per mu increased from 66.5 jin to 100.3 jin. The people of the county completely got rid of poverty and began to show a prosperous scene.

Fall Down Once, Gain Wisdom; Awaken Early, Leap Forward Early

However, the true wealth of socialist farmers is not easy to consolidate before the socialist revolution in the economic, political, and ideological spheres has achieved complete victory. After a bumper harvest, even the slightest complacency and slackening of efforts will prevent us from moving towards prosperity. In 1956, Dunhuang's cotton and grain production did not advance victoriously, but instead decreased from a grain yield of 279 jin per mu to 273 jin per mu, and from a cotton yield of 100.3 jin of ginned cotton per mu to 65.5 jin per mu. Natural disasters and capitalist ideological disasters simultaneously attacked Dunhuang's production in 1956. Rare freezing disasters, droughts, and wind disasters followed one after another. More than 40,000 mu of cotton fields were frozen in the spring (out of a total of more than 73,000 mu of cotton fields). Landlords, rich peasants, and bourgeois rightists tried to deny the superiority of cooperativization, stirred up trouble about insufficient grain, clamored for withdrawal from the cooperatives, and encouraged immigration and relocation; cadres with serious capitalist ideas engaged in speculation and profiteering and ran individual side businesses. In the struggle against this evil wind, the right-leaning thoughts of the cadres were very serious, and the county party committee did not show the strength and courage it should have. In May 1956, the prefectural committee criticized the county party committee. Comrade Huang Shifu, the secretary of the county party committee, an old soldier who had experienced the 25,000-li Long March, bravely examined the mistakes of the county party committee. He said sadly: If you are in charge of the work of an area, a slight slackening of efforts will bring great losses to the work; slackening of efforts is not a personal issue, but a political issue.

In 1956, when the whole country was in a high tide of production, Dunhuang instead reduced production. The cadres and people of Dunhuang County deeply absorbed this serious lesson, so in 1957, when the whole country was in a low tide of production, Dunhuang's cotton and grain production achieved a bumper harvest with a growth rate of 40 to 50 percent. The average yield per mu of cotton and grain reached the prescribed target of the National Agricultural Development Program ten years ahead of schedule.

Dunhuang's "saddle shape" in production appeared one year earlier than in other regions, and received the negative and positive education of this "saddle shape" one year earlier. When summarizing the experience of the bumper harvest in 1957, the county party committee particularly emphasized that the key to continuous increase in production is to continuously fight against capitalist ideas and right-leaning conservative ideas. This struggle must be carried out all year round. In the autumn and winter of 1956, Dunhuang absorbed the lesson of reduced production and set its mind on the ambition of "see you again next year." The struggle against right-leaning conservatism in the spring of 1957 and the struggle against rightists in the summer and autumn were the ideological basis for ensuring the bumper harvest in 1957.

See What is Showing on the Horizon; Eradicate Wrong Ideas in Their Bud

Fall down once, gain wisdom; fall down early, gain wisdom early. From the summer harvest of 1957, the Dunhuang County Party Committee noticed the emergence of new capitalist ideas and complacent slackening ideas far on the horizon. After the summer harvest and autumn harvest, the County Party Committee convened three cadre meetings, determined to eradicate these poisonous weeds in their bud. The content of one struggle was to severely criticize capitalist ideas by opposing concealment of production. More than 8 million jin of grain was found to have been concealed in the county. The crimes of about 30% of the commune cadres who stole and embezzled grain were dealt with seriously, and a great debate on two roads was conducted. Socialist ideas won the battle.

Another content of the struggle was to oppose extravagance and waste, and to carry out education on thrift in managing households, thrift in running communes, and hard work in production. After the bumper harvest, a phenomenon that was both good and not good appeared in the countryside: fancy clothes, fancy bedding, fancy houses (flower cloth around the kang, flower cloth curtains hanging, pictures on the wall), fancy bowls and dishes, and more new houses being built, more goods being bought, more cigarettes being smoked, more trips to the city to see operas and movies, and more meat and alcohol being consumed, etc. Many of these were extravagance and waste and bourgeois hedonistic ideas. The Zhangye Prefectural Committee also sent a working group to help the County Party Committee and launched a great debate among the masses. As a result, socialist ideas also won victory.

Still another content of the struggle was to oppose right-leaning conservative ideas and conduct education on striving for even greater harvests. At the end of 1957, the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was studied in conjunction with summarizing the experience of the bumper harvest. The County Party Committee put forward inspiring slogans: "Build Dunhuang into a cotton and grain base in Hexi!" "Plant the flag of large-area, high-yield cotton in the country on the land of Dunhuang!" "Think of all possible ways to strive for a greater harvest in 1958!" These ideological struggles have made relatively full ideological preparations for the great leap forward in 1958. At the four-level cadre meeting convened by the Zhangye Prefectural Committee in November 1957, Comrade Huang Shifu, Secretary of the Dunhuang County Party Committee, more clearly stated that the guarantee for continuous leap forward in agricultural production is to always pay attention to the struggle between the two roads in the countryside. He said: "If socialism wants to win a complete victory in the economic and ideological fields and completely consolidate itself, it must carry out two arduous tasks. On the one hand, vigorously develop production and completely change the backward appearance of the countryside; on the other hand, thoroughly educate and transform the thinking of wealthy middle peasants and fight against non-socialist ideas in the countryside. At the same time, we must use facts to continuously educate peasants and continuously improve their socialist thinking."

Advanced Leadership Thinking and Advanced Mass Thinking Intertwine

Advanced leadership thinking and advanced mass thinking are intertwined, and the great leap forward movement full of socialist ideas is launched like a landslide. The leaping forward ideas and soaring enthusiasm won the great summer harvest this year, and are very confident to win the autumn harvest. It seems that the honorary flag of "cotton and wheat thousand-jin county" is sure to be won. This year, the total grain output will leap forward from more than 45,890,000 jin last year to more than 116,920,000 jin at a growth rate of 130% (the grain sown area increased from more than 114,000 mu to more than 136,000 mu). The county's agricultural population of 57,311 people will have an average of 2,000 jin of grain per person. This year, the total output of seed cotton will leap forward from more than 24,500,000 jin last year (the cotton field area increased from more than 77,000 mu to more than 96,000 mu) to more than 96,300,000 jin at a growth rate of 293%. Each agricultural person will have an average of more than 1,700 jin of seed cotton.

Each farmer will have 2,000 jin of grain and 1,700 jin of seed cotton. What wealthy socialist farmers these are! However, the Party Committee and people of Dunhuang County are not satisfied with this huge achievement. The County Party Committee has now put forward to the people of the county the call to "strive to achieve a yield of ten thousand jin per mu of cotton and grain in the county," and is determined to think of all possible ways to strive to leap forward from a cotton and wheat double-thousand-jin county to a grain and cotton double-ten-thousand-jin county in 1959. Dunhuang, which has changed from poor and white to rich and beautiful, what a heroic and great aspiration this is!

Continuous Revolution, Make Persistent Efforts

Political Work Keeps Up with Economic Work

The idea of continuous revolution has generated great revolutionary enthusiasm among the cadres and people of Dunhuang County, and encouragement from all sides has further promoted this revolutionary enthusiasm to continue to rise. On April 3, the Zhangye Prefectural Committee specially chose to hold a joint meeting of county party committee secretaries in Dunhuang to evaluate the spring work of each county. Dunhuang was rated as an advanced county. In early August, the provincial party committee inspection and evaluation team also gave Dunhuang a great deal of praise. At the same time, the National Spring Wheat Conference held in Gansu, which visited and evaluated Zhangye, Dunhuang, Hezheng and other eleven counties while holding the meeting, also gave great praise to Dunhuang's wheat harvest. The continuous emergence of high-yield "satellites" all over the country has further inspired and encouraged the spirit of daring to think and daring to do among the people of Dunhuang. The Dunhuang County Party Committee promptly used these new driving forces, combined with the propaganda and study of the general line, to closely integrate political work and economic work. The mass insect extermination campaign is a very prominent example.

After five months of great battles, night battles, and hard battles, the entire county has basically become a "disease-free and insect-free cotton and grain county," which is a decisive battle to ensure a bumper harvest of cotton and grain. Dunhuang has had many pests and diseases in the past, and there are 22 kinds of pests and diseases that generally and seriously harm crops. At the beginning of this year, a mass insect prevention movement was launched to "let pests and insects be destroyed and have no offspring." The masses were mobilized to have great debates to strive to become a glorious "disease-free and insect-free cotton and grain county." In the first battle to eliminate the stink beetle, various right-leaning conservative ideas were swept away at the same time, such as the erroneous ideas that large-area prevention and control cost a lot of money, there were many tasks and few laborers, the supply of medicine and machinery could not be solved, too much medicine would burn the crops, and "the more you prevent the divine insects, the more they will be." Political cadres and technical cadres combined to publicize the economic and political significance of eliminating pests and diseases and striving for a bumper harvest, while explaining scientific principles to the masses to break superstitions. At the same time, they used the methods of carefully calculating accounts, stating facts, making breakthroughs with typical examples, and on-site visits to pursue right-leaning conservative ideas. After initially clearing away ideological obstacles, the Hongxingtasha branch of Wuxiang timely put forward the slogan "fight in the wheat fields during the day, fight in the wasteland at night, fight for three days and three nights, treat the wheat fields as battlefields, and let technical cadres be the advisers, and don't let the stink beetle pass the May Day" based on the enthusiasm of the masses. It immediately organized a large insect prevention army with all households and the entire commune participating, and marched toward the wheat field pests. In three days and three nights, it used pesticides to spray more than 5,400 mu of wheat fields and 1,300 mu of cotton fields. Before May Day, the first agricultural commune with cotton and grain free from pests and diseases appeared. The County Party Committee immediately organized 63 leading cadres from various townships and communes to hold an on-site meeting in Hongxingtasha, and also used the form of big-character posters to carry out criticism, encourage advanced elements, and launch competitions. After the meeting, the secretaries of each township took command, and the captains led the troops. In just ten days, four more pest-free townships, thirty-two pest-free communes, and one hundred and thirty-five pest-free teams emerged, basically becoming a cotton and grain pest-free county.

Plant the Red Flag and Don't Give Up an Inch of Land

Race to Catch Up with the Advanced and Seize Every Minute and Second

This spirit of making persistent efforts is also reflected in Dunhuang's preparations for a greater leap forward next year. As early as when the wheat began to turn yellow, the County Party Committee convened a cadre meeting to propose the goals for next year's struggle. Later, with the emergence of new situations and the rising enthusiasm of the masses, the effort targets were revised several times. It is now tentatively proposed that next year we will strive to become a cotton and grain double-ten-thousand-jin county, and that all cultivated land will be mechanized after the autumn harvest this year. Combined with the large-scale land leveling, all new collective manors will be rebuilt. Their ideal picture for next year is: "Cotton is better than peonies, grain piles up like mountains, melons and fruits have bumper harvests, machines are everywhere, every commune has a research institute, everyone becomes a technician, every household has a telephone, and songs shake the sky."

Is there any slackening phenomenon? Yes. The County Party Committee has discovered that individual responsible cadres in two townships have complacent and slackening sentiments, and that the contradictions between collectivist ideas and individualistic ideas in some townships and communes have become prominent again after the summer grain harvest. Moreover, because the County Party Committee has made great efforts to strive for double thousand-jin of cotton and wheat, it has relatively relaxed the development of local industry. Now, the County Party Committee has clearly realized these problems, and a new struggle is about to begin. The County Party Committee is preparing to launch socialist education for commune members by expanding public accumulation. They are preparing to call on the masses to use the vast majority of their income as public accumulation to ensure the realization of agricultural mechanization this year. In early August, when I left Dunhuang, the County Party Committee was formulating an action plan for further developing local industry in the county.

Many cadres in Dunhuang County have a particularly valuable quality in their mental state, that is, they have truly liberated their minds and dare to think boldly and act boldly. They are full of the spirit of continuous revolution. The effort targets they put forward are all "sweat targets." They do not put forward the "reassuring targets" that have been repeatedly cut down after thinking of all the measures. Based on the most advanced experience of the local area and other places, they really strive to go upstream and boldly put forward high targets, and then try every possible means to think of ways, formulate measures, work hard and practically, and ensure the completion of high targets. In their own words, they are "to use the determination to cut through nails, the confidence to ride a rocket, explore the moon, and compare speed with light," and with the spirit of "planting the red flag and not giving up an inch of land, racing to catch up with the advanced and seizing every minute and second," they will always strive to go upstream and always be pioneers in the national great leap forward. With this great ambition and this soaring enthusiasm, we believe that Dunhuang, this Saiwai Jiangnan surrounded by the vast Gobi Desert, will be built into a more prosperous and beautiful advanced county with modern agriculture, modern industry, and modern culture next year.

    从又穷又白变成又富又美
　　敦煌在不断革命中步步登高
    本报记者　胡季委
    编者按：经过一年来的苦战，很多原来又穷又白的地区，就会变成又富又美的地区。当它们是又穷又白的时候，干劲是很大的，当它们变成又富又美以后，只要掌握了不断革命的指导思想，干劲就会越来越大，旧的成绩将成为新的成绩的开端，它将鼓舞着人民更加信心百倍地从一个胜利走向更大的胜利。因而及时总结党委如何领导这些又富又美的地区继续前进的经验，对争取明年更大跃进有很重大的意义。这里介绍的甘肃敦煌县的情况，值得参考。
    又穷又白，干劲冲天。从又穷又白经过苦战变成又富裕又美丽以后，干劲是不是就会松下来呢？好些地方过去曾经是这样。我们自然应当深切记取这个教训，时时警惕这个危险。我们相信，我们一定能够防止和及时克服这个毛病。胜利自然容易使人自满，但是对我们共产主义者来说，胜利主要是更大胜利的动力，是新的胜利的起点。
    应该看到，胜利有走向它的反面的可能。有意无意地自满松劲情绪，会使先进者在大跃进中成为落后者。有些历年小麦丰产的富裕地区，原来满以为自己在小麦产量方面，今年仍然会坐第一把交椅，并没有像其他地区那样千方百计地苦干实干，今年虽然也增产很大，甚至拿自己的过去来比，仍然是空前的增产，但是这已经是老皇历、是老比法，如果比起别的地区的飞跃发展，就只能认输了。这是一类地区。还有另一类地区，它们历年小麦丰产，又富又美，今年继续猛进，得到冠军。甘肃省的敦煌县就是这类地区的一个优良典型。它是我国今年两个小麦千斤县中的一个（另一个是和政，也在甘肃），是甘肃省人民收入最多的县。
    戈壁滩上的小县苦干起家又富又美
    敦煌是世界闻名的地方。因为它的千佛洞是我国艺术的宝库。但是它却是嘉峪关外一个八万人口的小县。89％的土地都是戈壁和沙漠，耕地只有二十三万亩，还有可耕种的荒地五百多万亩。这里几乎终年不雨，每年平均降雨量只四十四点七公厘。但是这里是河西走廊的最西部，土地平坦肥沃，全部耕地都可以得到祁连山的雪水灌溉，无霜期平均一百一十七天，阳光特别充足（5月到9月每月日照三百小时到三百三十三小时）。解放以来，这里棉粮几乎年年丰收，去年小麦亩产四百零八斤，棉花亩产皮棉一百零五点五斤；人民收入很大，去年每一农业人口毛收入二百七十七元，纯收入一百九十三元，超过当地富裕中农的收入一倍以上。今年成为棉麦双千斤县以后，每一农业人口平均毛收入将达七百五十多元，今年大大扩大公共积累以后，每人纯收入也会在三百元左右，这就超过了一般城市工人和一般干部的收入。
    敦煌也是从又穷又白的条件下苦干起家的。解放时，这个戈壁和沙漠包围着的塞外小县，只有四万二千多人，耕地九万多亩，棉花每亩只有二十八斤，麦子每亩只收一百三十斤。当时，人民饥寒交迫，十几岁的大姑娘也穿不上裤子，27％的农民靠国家救济过活。县委领导人民经过四、五年的辛勤劳动，生产发展很快，全县高级合作化的第二年，1955年，更得到了粮食、棉花、湖草（牧草）、蔬菜、瓜果五大丰收，特别是棉田由一万七千多亩扩大到五万三千多亩，亩产皮棉由六十六点五斤增加到一百斤零三两，全县人民就根本摆脱了贫困的状态，开始出现了富裕的景象。
    跌一跤　长一智  早觉悟　早跃进
    但是，社会主义农民的真正的富裕，在经济上、政治上和思想上的社会主义革命还没有取得彻底胜利以前，是不容易巩固起来的。大丰收以后，那怕只有丝毫的自满和松劲情绪，资本主义势力的反扑就会阻挡我们走向富裕的道路。1956年敦煌的棉粮生产没有乘胜前进，反而由粮食亩产二百七十九斤降为二百七十三斤，由棉花亩产皮棉一百斤零三两降为六十五斤半。自然灾害和资本主义思想灾害同时袭击着1956年的敦煌生产。少有的冻灾、旱灾和风灾，接踵而来，春上受冻的棉花就有四万多亩
  （总棉田七万三千多亩）。地富分子和资产阶级右派分子妄想抹杀合作化的优越性，闹粮食不够，闹退社，鼓动移民搬家；资本主义思想严重的干部闹投机倒把，经营个人副业。在和这一场妖风作斗争中，干部中右倾思想很严重，县委也没有表现应有的坚强和勇敢。1956年5月，地委对县委进行了批评，县委书记黄仕福同志，是经历过二万五千里长征的老战士，勇敢地检讨了县委的错误，他曾沉痛地说：负责一个地区工作，稍为松劲，就给工作带来很大的损失；松劲不是个人的问题，而是政治性的问题。
    在全国生产高潮的1956年，敦煌反而减了产。敦煌县的干部和人民深切吸取了这个严重的教训，因而在全国生产低潮的1957年，敦煌的棉粮生产都以百分之四、五十的增涨速度得到了大丰收，棉粮平均亩产量提前十年达到了全国农业发展纲要的规定指标。
    敦煌生产上的“马鞍形”比其他地区早出现一年，早一年领受了这个“马鞍形”的反面教育和正面教育。县委在总结1957年的大丰收的经验时，特别强调，不断增产的关键，就是不断向资本主义思想和右倾保守思想作斗争，这个斗争一年四季都要进行。1956年秋冬，敦煌吸取了减产的教训，心里定下了“明年再见”的雄心。1957年春的反右倾保守的斗争，夏秋季的反右派斗争，都是保证1957年大丰收的思想基础。
    看水平线上什么露了头  在萌芽时期铲除错误思想
    跌一交长一智，早跌交早得智。敦煌县委从1957年夏季丰收中，就从远远的水平线上察觉到新的资本主义思想和自满松劲思想的露头，从夏收到秋收以后，县委召开了三次干部会议，决心把这些毒草在萌芽时期就加以铲除。一项斗争的内容，是通过反对瞒产，狠狠地痛击了资本主义思想。清查出全县瞒产八百多万斤粮食，严肃处理了约30％的社干部的偷分和贪污粮食的罪行，并进行了两条道路的大辩论，社会主义思想打了胜仗。
    另一项斗争的内容，是反对铺张浪费，进行勤俭持家、勤俭办社和勤劳生产的教育。丰收以后农村里普遍出现了又好又不好的现象：衣服花、铺盖花、房屋花（炕边围花布，挂花布门帘，墙上贴画），碗碟花和修新房多、买百货多、抽纸烟多、进城看戏看电影多、吃肉喝酒多等等现象，这中间有很多是铺张浪费和资产阶级的享乐思想。张掖地委还专门派了工作组帮助县委，在群众中展开大辩论，结果，社会主义思想也得到了胜利。
    再一项斗争的内容，是反对右倾保守思想，进行争取更大丰收的教育。1957年底结合总结丰收经验，学习党的八届三中全会的精神。县委提出了鼓舞人心的口号：“把敦煌建设成河西的棉粮基地！”“把全国棉花大面积高产的旗帜插在敦煌的土地上！”“想尽一切办法争取1958年的更大丰收！”这些思想斗争，都为1958年大跃进作了比较充分的思想准备。在1957年11月张掖地委召开的四级干部会议上，敦煌县委书记黄仕福同志的发言中，更明确地提出，使农业生产不断跃进的保证，是经常注意农村两条道路的斗争。他说：“社会主义要想在经济领域和思想领域中彻底胜利，而且彻底巩固起来，就必须进行两方面的艰巨工作。一方面大力发展生产，彻底改变农村落后面貌，另一方面，要彻底的教育和改造富裕中农的思想，以及向农村中的非社会主义思想作斗争。同时要用事实来不断教育农民，不断提高农民的社会主义思想。”
    先进的领导思想和先进的群众思想交织起来
    先进的领导思想和先进的群众思想交织起来了，充满着社会主义思想的生产大跃进运动也就排山倒海地开展起来了。跃进的思想和冲天的干劲，夺得了今年夏季的大丰收，并且十分有把握地将夺得秋季大丰收，“棉麦千斤县”的荣誉旗帜，看来是有把握争到手里。今年粮食总产量将由去年四千五百八十九万多斤，以增长130％的速度跃进为一亿一千六百九十二万多斤（粮食播种面积由十一万四千多亩增加到十三万六千多亩），全县农业人口五万七千三百一十一人，将平均每人有粮二千斤。今年棉花籽棉总产量将由去年的二千四百五十多万斤（棉田由七万七千多亩增加到九万六千多亩），以增长293％的速度跃进为九千六百三十多万斤，每一农业人口将平均有籽棉一千七百多斤。
    每一个农民将拥有二千斤粮食和一千七百斤籽棉，这是多么富裕的社会主义的农民！但是敦煌县的党委和人民，并不满足于这个巨大的成就。县委现在已经向全县人民提出“为实现全县棉粮亩产万斤而奋斗”的号召，决心想尽千方百计，争取1959年由棉麦双千斤县大跃进为粮棉双万斤县。由又穷又白变为又富又美的敦煌，这是多么豪迈的伟大志愿！
    不断革命　再接再厉
    政治工作跟上经济工作
    不断革命的思想已经在敦煌县的干部和人民当中产生出巨大的革命干劲，来自各方面的鼓舞更推动着这股革命干劲不断高涨。4月3日，张掖地委特别选择在敦煌召开全专区的县委书记联席会议，评比各县春季工作，敦煌被评为先进县。8月初，省委检查评比团也给敦煌以很大的表扬。同时，在甘肃召开的全国春小麦会议，在张掖、敦煌、和政等十一县一面参观评比一面举行会议，也给敦煌的小麦丰收以很大的称赞。全国各地不断出现的高产“卫星”，更启发和鼓舞了敦煌人民敢想敢干的精神。敦煌县委及时利用这些新的动力，结合总路线的宣传学习，把政治工作和经济工作密切结合起来。千军万马的灭虫运动，就是一个很突出的例子。
    经过五个月的大战夜战苦战，全县已经基本上成为“棉粮无病虫县”，这是保证棉粮大丰收具有决定意义的战斗。敦煌历年来病虫害很多，普遍严重为害农作物的病虫害有二十二种。今年一开春，就开展了一个“让病虫灭子灭孙”的群众性防虫运动，发动群众大辩论，争取成为光荣的“棉粮无病虫县”。在消灭臭班虫的第一个战役中，同时扫荡了各种形形色色的右倾保守思想，如认为大面积防治花钱多、任务多劳动力少、药械无法解决、药多会烧死庄稼、以及“神虫越防越多”等等错误思想。政治干部和技术干部结合起来，一方面宣传消灭虫害、争取丰收的经济意义和政治意义，同时向群众讲科学道理破除迷信，一方面用算细账、摆事实、典型突破和现场参观的办法，追击右倾保守思想。五乡红星塔社支部在初步扫清思想障碍以后，根据群众的热情要求及时提出“日战麦田，夜战荒滩，大战三天三夜，麦田当战场，技术干部当参谋，不让臭班虫过五一”的号召，立即组织了一个各户齐出动、全社齐动手的防虫大军，向麦田虫害进军，在三天三夜中，共用农药喷射麦田五千四百多亩和棉田一千三百多亩，五一前出现了棉粮无病虫害的第一个农业社。县委立即组织各乡社领导干部六十三人在红星塔社召开现场会议，还用大字报的形式开展批评，鼓励先进，展开竞赛。会后各乡书记挂帅，队长领兵，在短短十天当中，又出现四个无虫乡、三十二个无虫社和一百三十五个无虫队，基本成为棉粮无病虫县。
    插红旗寸土不让
    赶先进分秒必争
    这种再接再厉的精神，也表现在敦煌对明年更大跃进的准备上。早在麦子开始黄熟的时候，县委就召开干部会议，提出明年的奋斗目标，以后随着新情况的发生和群众新干劲的高涨，曾经几次修改努力指标，现在初步提出明年要争取成为棉粮双万斤县，提出今年秋后全部耕地就实行机械化，结合土地大平整全部改建新的集体庄园。他们明年的理想图画是这样：“棉花赛牡丹，粮食堆成山，瓜果大丰收，机器遍地走，社社成立研究室，人人变成技术员，户户通电话，歌声震九天。”
    究竟有没有松劲现象呢？有。县委已经发现有两个乡个别负责干部有自满松劲情绪，在夏粮丰收以后有的乡社集体主义思想和个人主义思想的矛盾又突出了。而且，由于县委为争取棉麦双千斤，付出了极大的努力，相对地就放松了地方工业的发展。现在，县委已经清醒地察觉到这些问题，新的斗争即将展开。县委正准备通过扩大公积金发动社员进行社会主义教育。他们准备号召群众把绝大部分收入作为公共积累，保证今年实现农业机械化。8月初，在我离开敦煌的时候，县委正在制订全县进一步发展地方工业的行动计划。
    敦煌县的很多干部在精神状态上有一个特别宝贵的品质，就是他们真正解放了思想，敢于大胆地想大胆地干，他们充满着不断革命的精神，他们提出的努力指标，都是一些“出汗指标”，他们不是把一切措施都想好了，才提出一再削减过的“定心指标”，他们是根据本地和各地最先进的经验，真是力争上游，大胆提出高额指标，跟着就千方百计地想办法、订措施，苦干实干，保证完成高额指标。用他们自己的话来说，是“要以斩钉断铁的决心，以乘火箭、探月球、与光比速度的信心”，以“插红旗寸土不让，赶先进分秒必争”的精神，在全国大跃进中永远争上游，永远作先锋。有了这种伟大的志向和这种冲天的干劲，我们相信，敦煌——这个大戈壁包围中的塞外江南，明年就会建设成为具有现代农业、现代工业和现代文化的更富裕更美丽的先进县。
