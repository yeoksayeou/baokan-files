Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang. The restoration and reconstruction project of the Sup'ung Dam Power Station on the Yalu River, which was severely damaged by American imperialism during the Korean War, has been completed ahead of schedule after three years and eight months of effort by Korean workers. A grand completion ceremony was held at the power station on the afternoon of August 30th.

This power station on the Yalu River, restored and rebuilt with the assistance of the Soviet Union, has been equipped with the latest technology. Its power generation capacity has reached 700,000 kilowatts, an increase of 100,000 kilowatts compared to the period under Japanese rule, and it can generate 500 to 600 million more kilowatt-hours of electricity annually than before.

Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of North Korea, attended the completion ceremony. In his speech, he praised the workers who built the power station for completing the restoration and reconstruction task one year and four months ahead of schedule. He pointed out that the completion of the restoration and reconstruction project of this largest hydroelectric station in Asia demonstrates that the Korean people are capable of restoring, constructing, and managing such large enterprises on their own. He also expressed his gratitude to the Soviet people for providing technical assistance to this project and to the Chinese workers and technicians who participated in this project.

The Chinese Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power delegation, headed by Feng Zhongyun, Vice Minister of Water Resources and Electric Power, was invited to attend this grand completion ceremony. Feng Zhongyun expressed warm congratulations to the Korean people in his speech. He said that over the past few years, the Sup'ung Dam Power Station has transmitted a large amount of electricity to support industrial production in Northeast China. The complete completion of the restoration and reconstruction project of this power station will undoubtedly play a greater role in the development of the economic construction of both China and North Korea.

The Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in North Korea also spoke at the ceremony.

The completion ceremony was held in a very warm atmosphere, with red flags fluttering on the heightened and strengthened dam. After Kim Doo-sam, Minister of Electricity of North Korea, cut the ribbon, Kim Il-sung, Choi Yong-kun, and other leaders of the Workers' Party of Korea and the government, as well as foreign diplomatic envoys and delegations who came to congratulate, ascended the 118-meter-high and over 900-meter-long dam amidst the cheers of more than 6,000 people. This large concrete dam, after being strengthened in this reconstruction project, will have its lifespan extended from the original twenty years to two hundred years. In addition, its performance in terms of consolidation, cold resistance, and impermeability has been significantly enhanced. The large dam impounds the upper reaches of the Yalu River above Sup'ung into a reservoir of more than 100 kilometers long, allowing the Yalu River water to impact the seven 100,000-kilowatt hydraulic generators of this power station, generating a large amount of electricity. Among them, the newly installed No. 5 generator was started by Premier Kim Il-sung pressing the button at today's completion ceremony.

    鸭绿江畔移山造海　英雄人民干劲冲天
    朝鲜水丰发电站恢复改建提早完成
    发电能力达七十万瓩是目前亚洲最大水电站
    新华社平壤电　在朝鲜战争中遭到美帝国主义严重破坏的水丰发电站的恢复改建工程，经过朝鲜工人三年零八个月的努力，已经提前完成。8月30日下午在发电站上举行了盛大的竣工仪式。
    这座在鸭绿江上的发电站在苏联的援助下进行了恢复和改建以后，它已经以最新式的技术装备起来，发电能力达到七十万瓩，比日本统治时期增加了十万瓩，每年比那时可以多发五亿到六亿度电。
    朝鲜内阁首相金日成参加了竣工仪式。他在讲话时表扬了修建这座发电站的工人们提前一年零四个月完成恢复改建任务的功绩。他指出，这座亚洲最大的水电站恢复改建工程的完成，说明朝鲜人民已经能够恢复、建设和自行管理这样的大企业。他还向对于这项工程提供技术援助的苏联人民和参加这项工程的中国工人和技术人员表示感谢。
    以中国水利电力部副部长冯仲云为首的中国水利电力部代表团应邀参加了这个盛大的竣工仪式。冯仲云在讲话时向朝鲜人民表示热烈的祝贺。他说，几年来水丰发电站输送了大量的电力支援中国东北地区的工业生产用电。这座发电站的恢复改建工程的全部竣工，对于发展中朝两国的经济建设必将起更大的作用。
    苏联驻朝鲜大使馆临时代办也在仪式上讲了话。
    竣工仪式在十分热烈的气氛中举行，经过加高加固了的大坝上红旗招展。在朝鲜电气相金斗三剪彩以后，金日成、崔庸健等朝鲜劳动党和政府的领导人和前来祝贺的各国外交使节和代表团，在六千多群众的欢呼声中，登上高一百一十八公尺、长九百多公尺的大坝顶。这个大混凝土坝在这次改建工程中加固后，它的寿命将从原来的二十年延长到二百年，另外在巩固、耐寒、不透水等方面的性能都显著地加强了。由这个大坝把由水丰以上的鸭绿江上游拦成了一个一百多公里长的水库，使鸭绿江水冲击着这座发电站的七台发电能力各为十万瓩的水力发电机，发出大量的电力。其中新安装的第五号发电机是在今天的竣工仪式上由金日成首相按电钮使它开始转动的。
