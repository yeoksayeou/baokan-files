　　Exciting Changes
    In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, the Dong people have caught up. The "slash-and-burn agriculture, relying on the mountains for food," which has been followed for thousands of years, has been transformed in a very short period of time into large-scale water conservancy construction, deep plowing, close planting, increased fertilization, and the use of new agricultural tools. What an exciting change this is!
    Due to various historical reasons, the economic and cultural development of ethnic minorities in our country has been very slow. But this situation is changing rapidly. In the near future, this backwardness left over from history will become history. Dozens of ethnic groups in our country will become advanced ethnic groups.
    Poverty and blankness are significant characteristics of our country. And in comparison, ethnic minorities are even poorer and blanker. Just as Chairman Mao said, this looks like a bad thing, but it is actually a good thing. Poverty leads to change, to action, to revolution. A blank sheet of paper, without burden, is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, good for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures. The fact is exactly like this, the ethnic minorities in our country are trying every possible means to change, they have broken through superstition, and revolutionized the old conventions and bad habits, drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures on a clean sheet of paper. Aren't the news and communications about the Dong people published in today's newspaper the most powerful proof?

　　令人兴奋的变化
    在大跃进的高潮中，侗族人民赶上来了。千百年沿袭下来的“刀耕火种、赶山吃饭”，在很短的期间一变而为大修水利、深耕、密植、多施肥、使用新式农具。这是多么令人兴奋的变化啊！
    由于种种历史原因，我国少数民族在经济、文化方面的发展是很缓慢的。但这种状况正在迅速改变。不久的将来，这种历史上遗留下来的落后，就又要变成历史了。我国几十个民族都要变成先进的民族。
    一穷二白，这是我国显著的特点。而比较起来，少数民族则是更穷更白。正像毛主席说的，这看起来是坏事，其实是好事。穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。事实正是这样，我国少数民族正在千方百计地变，他们已经冲破了迷信，革掉了陈规陋习的命，在一张洁白的纸上画出了最新最美的画图。今天报上刊登的关于侗族的新闻和通讯，不就是最有力的证明吗？
