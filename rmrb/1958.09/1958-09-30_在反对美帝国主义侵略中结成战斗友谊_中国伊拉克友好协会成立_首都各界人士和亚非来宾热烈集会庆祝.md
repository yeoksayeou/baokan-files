Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: Over 1,500 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand meeting this morning at the CPPCC Auditorium, warmly celebrating the establishment of the China-Iraq Friendship Association. The combat friendship between the people of China and Iraq, forged in their common struggle, has entered a new stage today. The fighting people of Iraq have received here the most sincere and strong support from the 600 million people of China.

This was a demonstrative meeting showing the close unity of the people of Asian and African countries and their firm opposition to their common enemy—U.S. imperialist aggression. Seventy-nine distinguished guests from Iraq, the United Arab Republic, Sudan, Algeria, Mauritania in West Africa, Cameroon, and other countries and regions joined the people of the capital in today's celebration.

On the central curtain of the rostrum were the national flags of China and Iraq. On the walls on both sides of the venue were huge, eye-catching slogans written in Chinese and Arabic: "Long Live the Friendship between the Chinese and Iraqi People!" "Long Live the Solidarity of the Asian and African People!"

At 10:30 a.m., Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi and the heads of sixteen organizations, together with all the foreign guests, ascended the rostrum. At this moment, warm applause rose one after another. The guests and hosts on the rostrum stood up several times, warmly applauding for a long time with the welcoming crowd. The Chinese people's deepest respect for the revolutionary Iraqi people and the people of Asia and Africa, and the strong fighting friendship of the Asian and African countries, were completely integrated at this moment.

The moderator of the meeting, Zhang Xiruo, announced at the meeting that the China-Iraq Friendship Association had been jointly initiated by sixteen Chinese people's organizations, and that Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Vice Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, had been unanimously elected as President, and Luo Jun, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries of the People's Republic of China, as Vice President.

The sixteen people's organizations that jointly initiated the establishment of the China-Iraq Friendship Association are: the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, the China Peace Committee, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, the China Political Science and Law Society, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the China Association for Science and Technology, the China Islamic Association, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the All-China Sports Federation, the All-China Journalists Association, the Red Cross Society of China, and the Chinese Medical Association.

In his opening speech, Zhang Xiruo announced that the purpose of the China-Iraq Friendship Association is to "promote cultural exchanges between China and Iraq, enhance mutual understanding between the people of China and Iraq, and develop the friendly relations between the people of China and Iraq." He wished the Association would make outstanding contributions to enhancing the friendship, unity, and cooperation between the two peoples. Zhang Xiruo also warmly welcomed the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China, the Iraqi Cultural Delegation, and all friends from Arab countries, African countries, and regions attending the meeting.

President Liu Ningyi of the China-Iraq Friendship Association spoke amid warm applause (full text on page 6). He announced that we want to express our heartfelt congratulations once again on behalf of the 600 million Chinese people on the birth of the Republic of Iraq, and warmly cheer the great victory of the Iraqi people's revolution!

The entire audience supported Liu Ningyi's belief, on behalf of the Chinese people, with prolonged and stormy applause: the forces of peace and justice will surely triumph over the imperialist forces of war and all reactionary forces, the people of the world will surely push history forward, and the evil colonialism and imperialism will surely be completely eliminated from the earth! Liu Ningyi stated that the Chinese people and the people of the entire socialist countries will always stand with the people of Iraq and the Arab countries, fight side by side, and move forward hand in hand.

The speeches of the three representatives from Iraq were extremely warmly welcomed at today's meeting. When the Iraqi friends spoke at the meeting, bursts of applause poured out like a storm. When Mahmoud, the head of the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China, approached the podium to speak, he raised his clenched hands and warmly greeted everyone. He first thanked the sixteen Chinese organizations for initiating the establishment of the China-Iraq Friendship Association, saying that the establishment of this association will further enhance the friendship between the people of China and Iraq and further develop cooperation between the two countries in various fields.

Head of Delegation Mahmoud said excitedly that China and Iraq have a common situation, that is, U.S. imperialism occupies your beloved land, the U.S. Seventh Fleet occupies your territorial waters, and U.S. imperialism interferes in your internal affairs, attempting to prevent you from liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands. In the Middle East, U.S. and British troops occupied Lebanon and Jordan, and the U.S. Sixth Fleet threatened peace there. Therefore, it can be said that in the struggle against the common enemy, our two countries are close partners.

Head of Delegation Mahmoud said that when the Middle East and the young Republic of Iraq were subjected to the aggression and threat of U.S. and British imperialism, the 600 million people of your country issued huge shouts of protest that shook those who did not want to hear the voice of justice. This is something we can never forget. We will also never forget the Chinese people's support for the people of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, nor will we forget your recent recognition of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. You have deeply planted the seeds of friendship in our hearts. He said that now U.S. imperialism is threatening the peace of the Far East and invading China, just as it is threatening the peace of the Middle East and invading the Middle East. But the people of the world support the Chinese people, and U.S. imperialism must be completely defeated.

Zalzal, the head of the Iraqi Cultural Delegation, who had just arrived in Beijing this morning, said at the meeting that the Iraqi Cultural Delegation's visit to China is a good start to cultural exchanges between China and Iraq. In the future, the two countries will send more delegations to visit each other, expressing the strong will of the people of the two countries to safeguard world peace and develop human culture. He said that now thousands upon thousands of people in the world are struggling to break free from the shackles of colonialism and to win national independence. Thousands upon thousands of people are opposing imperialist interference in their lives and demanding world peace. He said that the Iraqi people are willing to join hands with the Chinese people to fight for the creation of a happy world and a world of lasting peace. The Iraqi Cultural Delegation will continue to work hard for the development of the cultural undertakings of the two countries. Zalzal finally strongly stated: "We love peace, but we are not afraid of war. If the enemy starts a war, we will use war to eliminate war!"

Dullaha, a member of the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China, said excitedly in his speech that their visit to China was specifically to thank the Chinese people for their support. He said that the establishment of the China-Iraq Friendship Association will surely be warmly welcomed by the Iraqi people.

He said that Western colonialists say that China lives behind the Iron Curtain. In fact, we used to live in a large prison. He said that the Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people is the greatest miracle of the twentieth century. We will convey these great achievements of the Chinese people to the Iraqi people.

Dullaha pointed out that the Chinese and Iraqi people have suffered together from colonialist aggression and oppression, and have a common destiny. A hundred years ago, the Chinese people awakened, and the struggle achieved final victory, the People's Republic of China was established, and you used your own hands to build your motherland. Our struggle began forty years ago, and our people have paid a great price. The struggle is arduous, and now we should harvest our own crops. On July 14, our revolution triumphed, we drove out the imperialists, eliminated the traitors, eliminated the reactionary feudal dynasty, and announced a peaceful foreign policy. Our victory has won the support of the people of Arab countries, the support of socialist countries, especially the support of the Chinese people, which has played a great role in our victory, so we have come to thank you specifically.

He said that we have only just taken the first step, and the imperialists and reactionaries have one last desperate weapon, which is the weapon of final struggle. But the great weapon of the people's power is more vital than their desperate weapon of dying struggle. Our road is long, and the entire Iraqi people will continue to work hard. We are willing to maintain friendly relations with socialist countries, and I believe you will not be stingy.

She finally said that we have shared weal and woe in the past, and now we are conducting a common struggle against imperialism. He said that the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan will surely achieve final victory, and imperialism is destined to die.

Guests from the UAR, Sudan, Algeria, African Mauritania, and Cameroon were invited to speak at the meeting successively.

The Ambassador of the United Arab Republic to China, Ragab, warmly congratulated the establishment of the Association at the meeting, and congratulated the Association on its great development and achievements in promoting and consolidating the mission of friendship between China and the Arab world.

Ambassador Ragab said: The imperialists and their agents will not easily bow to defeat. The main purpose of the United States' dispatch of troops to land in Lebanon and the United Kingdom's dispatch of troops to land in Jordan is to exert political pressure on Iraq on the one hand and on the United Arab Republic on the other, which almost brought the world to the brink of war. But the unity of the Iraqi government and its people and the unity of all Arab nations and peace-loving nations have defeated all the plans of imperialism.

He said: The imperialists are unwilling to admit their failure in Iraq, so they have turned their aggression from the Middle East to the Far East. No matter what happens in the Taiwan Strait and the coastal islands, we are fully convinced that the final victory will belong to the great People's Republic of China, because it has always maintained the cause of justice. In his speech, Ambassador Ragab recalled the Chinese people's sympathy and support for the anti-colonial struggles of the people of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Algeria, and he warmly expressed the deep feelings of the Arab people for the Chinese people. He said: The most important task of us Arabs is to repay China's brotherly assistance and give all possible support to China's just cause until the Chinese achieve victory, because China's victory is actually our victory.

Secretary General of the Sudanese Peace Committee, Keir, said in his speech: There is nothing more intimate than this, because we are gathered together for a noble cause - the cause of Iraqi-Chinese friendship. Iraq used to be one of the strongest strongholds of imperialism in the Middle East, and when the Iraqi people dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, they made the Arab people feel proud. The Chinese people have also made the Asian people feel proud, because they have given imperialism a heavy blow at one of the strongest strongholds of imperialism in Asia. Let Chinese-Iraqi friendship be the force that consolidates Iraqi democracy and binds together all Arab peoples with the peoples of victorious socialist countries. He emphasized that unity with socialist countries is the main condition for the victory of national liberation movements in colonial countries today. Keir warmly congratulated the great achievements of China's socialist construction. He said that China's achievements are also a great victory for the Asian-African national liberation movement, and it teaches us to believe in the people, and to believe that their creative power can enable the people to overcome all difficulties on the road to progress, prosperity and growth.

Keir sternly condemned the United States' crimes of creating tension in the Near East and the Far East. He said: All sober-minded people and all realistic and honest people in the world know that it is the United States that is creating and intensifying tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and it is the United States that is invading Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan. Anyone with a brain knows that easing tensions in the Taiwan Strait means nothing but saying that the United States must withdraw its armed forces, stop its provocations, and stop interfering in the internal affairs of People's China. The "ceasefire" conspiracy trumpeted by Dulles and Eisenhower cannot have any other meaning. It can only mean that the United States has the right to arm and occupy China's islands and use these islands as a springboard for attacking the Chinese mainland. The logic of U.S. imperialism can only deceive fools and people with mental disorders.

Finally, Keir excitedly recited in poetic language: "The east wind of China brings a rich fragrance, which makes us Asian and African people full of joy. Let us welcome this east wind on our land, welcome the country from which the east wind blows." "Our line is strong, and the enemy's position is trembling; if the United States provokes a war, we will destroy them in a sea of fire!"

Salal, President of the General Association of Muslim Students of Algeria, said that he was grateful to the organizers of the conference for inviting him to participate in this conference. He said that the fact that he was invited to participate in the conference shows the Chinese people's sympathy and love for Algerian youth and all the people.

Salal said that recently the Chinese government, following the Arab countries, recognized the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. This action is a great encouragement to the Algerian people and will definitely help to consolidate the victory that the Algerian fighters have already achieved. He said that the Arab people sympathize with and admire the struggle of the Chinese people, and unreservedly support the Chinese people's legitimate demands and aspirations to recover Taiwan. Salal finally congratulated the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Arab peoples, which is growing stronger in the current era of striving for national independence and eliminating imperialism, and in the struggle for social progress and defending world peace.

Prince Cisse Zakaria of Mauritania, Africa, said in his speech that at today's conference he saw the deep feelings of the Chinese people for the African people, and he expressed that he would convey this feeling of the Chinese people to people from all walks of life in Africa. He said that the African and Asian people cannot be separated. Today, there is no country, no region, and no family in Africa that does not support the Chinese people's desire to liberate their territory. All African people support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan.

He said that the entire Africa and Asia have been united and connected in history. Although we are still suffering from imperialist rule, we must overcome this obstacle to meet you and fight with you. All the people of Asia and Africa have risen up together to fight against the common enemy that oppresses us, the people of Asia and Africa - the imperialists. No force in the world can stop us from moving forward, the future of Asia and Africa belongs to the people of Asia and Africa, and the future of the world belongs to the people who strive for peace.

Onndi, Vice Chairman of the Cameroon People's Union from Africa, said in his speech that at today's grand meeting we have seen the consolidated friendship between two newly emerging countries, China and Iraq, both of which have achieved revolutionary victories, which is a victory for all progressive humanity. Today, three-quarters of the African people are fighting for national independence and against colonialism. We hope that all peace-loving people in the world will support us. He said that the Cameroonian people will use all actions to support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan, and the Chinese people's struggle to recover their own territory will surely achieve victory. He hailed world peace and the freedom and unity of mankind, and hailed the friendship between the people of all countries.

After the speeches, the meeting read out a telegram from the China-Iraq Friendship Association to the President, Prime Minister, and people of Iraq.

Today's meeting was a meeting with a high degree of enthusiasm for anti-colonialist struggle, and a meeting showing the strength of the unity of the people in Asia and Africa. People were moved by the strong and powerful voices issued at the meeting. All the speeches were constantly interrupted by the enthusiastic applause of Chinese and foreign guests. The meeting was filled with a strong atmosphere of peace and friendship from beginning to end. After the meeting, a movie was shown.

Today, heads of government departments and people's organizations such as Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Hanfu, Mao Dun, Chu Tunan, Shi Liang, Bao Erhan, Da Punsheng, and Liu Xiyuan, all attended the meeting.

    在反对美帝国主义侵略中结成战斗友谊
    中国伊拉克友好协会成立
    首都各界人士和亚非来宾热烈集会庆祝
    据新华社29日讯  首都各界人民一千五百多人今天上午在政协礼堂举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝中国伊拉克友好协会成立。中伊两国人民在共同的斗争中结成的战斗友谊，从今天开始又跨进了一个新阶段，战斗的伊拉克人民在这里得到了中国六亿人民最真诚而强烈的支持。
    这是一次显示亚非各国人民亲密团结和坚决反对它们的共同敌人——美帝国主义侵略的示威性的大会。来自伊拉克、阿拉伯联合共和国、苏丹、阿尔及利亚、西非毛里塔尼亚、喀麦隆等国家和地区的七十九位贵宾，同首都各界人民一起，参加了今天的庆祝大会。
    主席台正中的帷幕上挂着中伊两国国旗。会场两边的墙壁上有用中文和阿拉伯文写的巨大的醒目标语：“中国伊拉克人民友好万岁！”“亚非人民团结万岁！”
    十时半，陈毅副总理兼外交部长和十六个团体的负责人，同全体外国来宾们一起登上主席台。这时热烈的掌声一阵高过一阵，主席台上的宾主们数次起立，同欢迎群众一起长时间地热烈鼓掌，中国人民对革命的伊拉克人民及亚非人民最深厚的敬意，亚非各国人民坚强的战斗友谊，这时完全融合在一起。
    大会主持人张奚若在会上宣布：中国伊拉克友好协会已由我国十六个人民团体联合发起成立，并且一致推选中华全国总工会主席、中国亚非团结委员会副主席刘宁一为会长，中华人民共和国对外文化联络委员会副主任罗俊为副会长。
    联合发起成立中国伊拉克友好协会的十六个人民团体是：中国人民对外文化协会、中国亚非团结委员会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中华全国总工会、中华全国青年联合会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中国人民外交学会、中国政治法律学会、中国文学艺术界联合会、中国科学技术协会、中国伊斯兰教协会、中国国际贸易促进委员会、中华全国体育总会、中华全国新闻工作者协会、中国红十字总会和中华医学会。
    张奚若在开会词中宣布中国伊拉克友好协会的宗旨是：“促进中、伊两国的文化交流，增进中、伊两国人民的互相了解，发展中、伊两国人民的友好关系。”他预祝协会在增进两国人民的友谊和团结合作上作出卓越的贡献。张奚若还表示热烈欢迎出席大会的伊拉克人民友好访华团、伊拉克文化代表团和所有阿拉伯国家、非洲国家和地区的全体朋友。
    中国伊拉克友好协会会长刘宁一在热烈的掌声中讲话（全文见第六版），他宣布说，我们要代表中国六亿人民再一次为伊拉克共和国的诞生表示衷心祝贺，为伊拉克人民革命的伟大胜利而热烈欢呼！
    全场以长时间的暴风雨般的掌声支持刘宁一所代表的中国人民这样的信念：和平与正义的力量肯定地要战胜帝国主义的战争势力和一切反动势力，世界人民肯定地要推动历史前进，万恶的殖民主义和帝国主义肯定地将从地球上被彻底消灭干净！刘宁一表示，中国人民和整个社会主义国家的人民，将永远同伊拉克和阿拉伯各国的人民站在一起，并肩战斗，紧密地携手前进。
    来自伊拉克的三位代表的讲话，在今天大会上受到了极为热烈的欢迎。当伊拉克朋友在大会上讲话的时候，会场上一阵阵的掌声像暴风雨般的倾泻出来。伊拉克人民友好访华团团长马哈茂德走近讲坛讲话时，高举紧握的双手，向大家热烈致意。他首先感谢中国十六团体发起成立中伊友好协会，他说这个协会的成立将使中国和伊拉克两国人民的友谊进一步增强，使两国各方面的合作得到进一步的发展。
    马哈茂德团长激动地说，中国和伊拉克有着共同的境遇，这就是美帝国主义侵占着你们可爱的土地，美国第七舰队侵占你们的领海，美帝国主义干涉你们的内政，企图阻止你们解放台湾和沿海岛屿。在中东，美、英军队侵占了黎巴嫩和约旦，美国第六舰队威胁着那里的和平。因此可以说，在反对共同敌人的斗争中，我们两国是亲密的伙伴。
    马哈茂德团长说，当中东和年轻的伊拉克共和国遭受到美英帝国主义的侵略和威胁时，你们国家的六万万人民发出了巨大的抗议吼声，震动了那些不愿听到正义声音的人。这是我们永远不能忘记的。我们还永远不会忘记中国人民对埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩和约旦人民的支持，也不会忘记最近你们对阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的承认。你们在我们的心里深深种下了友谊的种子。他说，现在美帝国主义又像它在威胁中东和平和侵略中东那样，威胁远东的和平和侵略中国。但是全世界人民都支持中国人民，美帝国主义一定要遭到彻底的失败。
    今天早晨刚才赶到北京的伊拉克文化代表团团长扎尔扎拉在会上讲话说，伊拉克文化代表团这次访问中国，是中伊两国文化往来的良好开端，今后两国将互派更多的代表团互相进行访问，表示两国人民保卫世界和平和发展人类文化的坚强意志。他说，现在世界上千千万万的人民都在为挣脱殖民主义的枷锁而斗争，为争取民族独立而斗争。千千万万的人都在反对帝国主义干涉他们的生活，要求世界和平。他说，伊拉克人民愿意和中国人民共同携手为创造一个幸福的世界、持久和平的世界而斗争。伊拉克文化代表团将为两国文化事业的发展而不断努力。扎尔扎拉最后强烈的表示：“我们热爱和平，但我们并不害怕战争，如果敌人发动战争，我们就要用战争来消灭战争！”
    伊拉克人民友好访华团团员杜拉哈在讲话中兴奋地说，他们这次来中国，是特地为了来感谢中国人民对他们的支持的。他说，中伊友好协会的成立，肯定地会受到伊拉克人民的热烈欢迎。
    他说，西方殖民主义者说，中国生活在铁幕后面，事实上，我们过去是生活在一个大牢狱中。他说中国人民的大跃进，是二十世纪的最大奇迹。我们将把中国人民这些伟大成就传达给伊拉克人民。
    杜拉哈指出，中国人民和伊拉克人民共同遭受殖民主义的侵略和压迫，有着共同的命运。一百年前，中国人民就觉醒了，斗争得到了最后的胜利，成立了中华人民共和国，并用你们自己的手来建设了祖国。我们的斗争在四十年前开始了，我们的人民付出了巨大的牺牲，斗争是艰苦的，现在我们该收获我们自己的庄稼了。7月14日我们的革命胜利了，我们赶走了帝国主义，铲除了卖国贼，消灭了反动的封建王朝，宣布了和平的外交政策。我们的胜利获得了阿拉伯各国人民的支持，获得了社会主义各国的支持，特别是获得了中国人民的支持，这个支持对我们的胜利起了很大的作用，所以我们特来感谢你们。
    他说，我们才刚刚走了第一步，帝国主义和反动派还有一个绝望的武器，这就是最后挣扎的武器。但是人民力量这个巨大武器比他们垂死挣扎的绝望武器更有生命力。我们的道路是漫长的，伊拉克全国人民将继续努力，我们愿意同社会主义国家保持友好关系，我相信你们是不会吝惜的。
    她最后说，我们过去共过患难，现在又在为反对帝国主义进行共同的斗争。他说，中国人民解放金门、马祖和台湾的斗争一定会取得最后的胜利，帝国主义是注定要死亡的。
    来自阿联、苏丹、阿尔及利亚、非洲毛里堪尼亚、喀麦隆的来宾先后应邀在大会上讲话。
    阿拉伯联合共和国驻中国大使拉加卜在大会上热烈地祝贺协会的成立，祝贺协会在促进与巩固中国与阿拉伯之间的友谊的使命方面获得极大的发展与成就。
    拉加卜大使说：帝国主义者及其代理人不会轻易地向失败低头。美国派遣军队在黎巴嫩登陆，英国派遣军队在约旦登陆其主要目的是一方面对伊拉克，另一方面对阿拉伯联合共和国施加政治压力，这样就几乎使世界濒于战争的边缘。但是伊拉克政府及其人民的团结和一切阿拉伯民族与爱好和平民族的团结，击败了帝国主义的一切计划。
    他说：帝国主义者不甘心承认他们在伊拉克的失败，因此他们把他们的侵略地区从中东转向远东。不论在台湾海峡与沿海岛屿将发生什么事情，我们完全相信，最后胜利将属于伟大的中华人民共和国，因为它一直维护着正义的事业。拉加卜大使在讲话中回述了中国人民对埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩和阿尔及利亚人民反殖民主义斗争的同情和支持，他热情地表达了阿拉伯人民对中国人民的深厚感情。他说：我们阿拉伯人的最重要的任务就是酬答中国的兄弟般的援助，对中国的正义事业给予一切可能的支持，直到中国人获得胜利时为止，因为中国的胜利实际上就是我们的胜利。
    苏丹和平委员会总书记凯尔在讲话中说：再也没有什么事情比这件事更亲切了，因为我们为了一个崇高的事业——伊拉克中国友好的事业而聚会在一起。伊拉克曾经是帝国主义在中东的一个最强大的据点，当伊拉克人民给帝国主义以沉重打击的时候，就使得阿拉伯人民扬眉吐气了。中国人民也使得亚洲人民扬眉吐气，因为他们在帝国主义在亚洲的一个最强大的据点上给了帝国主义以沉重的打击。让中国伊拉克友谊成为巩固伊拉克的民主，并且成为凝结一切阿拉伯人民同胜利的社会主义国家人民之间的友好关系的力量。他强调说，同社会主义国家的团结一致，是今天殖民地国家的民族解放运动取得胜利的主要条件。凯尔热情祝贺中国社会主义建设的伟大成就。他说，中国的成就，也是亚非民族解放运动的巨大胜利，它教导我们要相信人民，相信他们的创造力量可以使人民在进步、繁荣和成长的道路上克服一切困难。
    凯尔严正地指责了美国在中近东和远东制造紧张局势的罪行，他说：全世界一切头脑清醒的人民，一切实事求是的诚实的人民都知道，在台湾海峡地区制造和加剧紧张局势的正是美国，侵略金门、马祖和台湾的也正是美国。任何有头脑的人都知道，缓和台湾海峡地区紧张局势的意思不是别的，而是说：美国必须撤退它的武装部队，停止挑衅，不再干涉人民中国的内政。杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔所大肆宣扬的“停火”阴谋，不可能有其他意思，它只能意味着让美国有权武装占领中国的岛屿，并且利用这些岛屿作为向中国大陆进攻的跳板。美帝国主义的逻辑只能欺骗傻瓜和神志不清的人。
    凯尔最后用诗的语言激动地朗诵道：“中国的东风，吹来了浓郁的芳香，使我们亚洲和非洲人们满心欢喜。让我们在我们的土地上欢迎这股东风，欢迎东风从那里吹来的国土。”“我们的阵线是坚强的，敌人的阵地在颤抖；如果美国挑起战争，我们就把他们消灭在火海里！”
    阿尔及利亚穆斯林学生联合会总会主席萨拉尔讲话时表示，感激大会的组织者邀请他来参加这次大会。他说，邀请他参加大会这一事实，表明了中国人民对于阿尔及利亚青年和全体人民的同情和热爱。
    萨拉尔说，最近中国政府继阿拉伯国家之后承认了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府。这一行动对于阿尔及利亚人民是一个莫大的鼓舞，并肯定地有助于巩固阿尔及利亚战士所已经取得的胜利。他说，阿拉伯人民同情和赞赏中国人民的斗争，并且毫无保留地支持中国人民收复台湾的合法要求和愿望。萨拉尔最后祝贺中国和阿拉伯人民的传统友谊，在当前争取民族独立和消灭帝国主义的时代，在为了社会进步和保卫世界和平的斗争中日益加强。
    非洲毛里塔尼亚西塞·扎卡里亚亲王在讲话中说，在今天的大会上，他看到了中国人民对非洲人民的深厚感情，他表示要把中国人民的这种感情转达给非洲各阶层的人民。他说，非洲和亚洲人民是不能分离的，今天在非洲没有一个国家、一个地区和一个家庭不支持中国人民解放自己领土的愿望，全非洲人民都支持中国人民解放台湾的斗争。
    他说，整个非洲和亚洲在历史上就是团结和联系在一起的。虽然现在我们还遭受帝国主义的统治，但是我们要超越这个障碍来和你们会面，同你们一起进行斗争。所有亚非人民已经一齐起来同压迫我们亚非人民的共同敌人——帝国主义者作不屈的斗争。世界上没有任何力量能够阻止我们前进，亚非的未来是亚非人民的，世界的未来是争取和平的人民的。
    来自非洲的喀麦隆人民联盟副主席翁地在讲话中说，在今天的盛会上，我们看到了两个新生国家中国和伊拉克之间巩固的友谊，这两个国家都取得了革命的胜利，这是全体进步人类的胜利。今天，四分之三的非洲人民都在为争取民族独立和反对殖民主义而斗争。我们希望世界上一切爱好和平的人民都支持我们。他说，喀麦隆人民将用一切行动来支持中国人民解放台湾的斗争，中国人民收复自己领土的斗争一定会取得胜利。他欢呼世界和平和人类的自由、团结万岁，欢呼各国人民之间的友好万岁。
    讲话结束以后，大会宣读了中国伊拉克友好协会向伊拉克主席、总理和人民致敬的电文。
    今天的大会是一个强烈的反殖民主义斗争热情高涨的大会，是一个显示亚非地区人民团结力量的大会，人们为大会上发出的坚强有力的声音所激动，所有的讲话不断为中外来宾狂热的掌声所打断，大会自始至终充满了强烈的和平友谊的气氛。大会结束后放映了电影。
    今天，政府部门和各人民团体的负责人廖承志、章汉夫、茅盾、楚图南、史良、包尔汉、达浦生、刘西元等，都参加了大会。
