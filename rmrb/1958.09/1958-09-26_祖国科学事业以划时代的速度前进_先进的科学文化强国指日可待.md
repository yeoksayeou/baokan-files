Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: The situation where China's science and technology lagged behind the world level for nearly a century will soon be gone forever! The miracles in the great leap forward in science and technology in the past few months have filled people with this belief. The Great Leap Forward has propelled Chinese science into a brand new historical stage.

The Communist Party's comprehensive and extremely effective leadership of Chinese science and technology; the combination of experts and the masses – a mass movement to run science is beginning to take shape; science serves production and is combined with practice; liberate thought and exert full effort; implement communist collaboration; advance along the path of more, faster, better, and more economical results. All of this is the most fundamental reason for the rapid leap forward of Chinese science and technology.

Engaging in scientific research for a few years or decades is not considered long. However, the Chinese people have made a large number of valuable scientific and technological achievements in a short period of time. Research results that have reached and exceeded the world's advanced level are no longer isolated cases, but can be seen everywhere. For example, the successful manufacture of high-power high-frequency semiconductor transistors, silicon rubber with special excellent performance, more than two hundred kinds of never-fading reactive dyes, the best nylon - "Nylon 9", grass fiber rayon, the important instrument for studying nuclear physics "hundred-channel pulse analyzer", and tissue vaccines for preventing measles; the research results of basic theories such as atmospheric circulation, the separation of all fifteen kinds of rare earth elements, building houses without bricks, wood, steel, bones, and cement, synthesizing petroleum from water gas, high-yield technology for chlortetracycline, successful medical treatment for severe burns... all are red flags planted on the peaks of world science. Some are being researched abroad but have not been successful; some exceed the world's advanced level in quality, and some are world firsts.

Science and Technology Leap Out of the Expert's Circle

Many valuable research results were achieved by ordinary working people who have not received higher education or even attended formal schools. For example, the atomic energy metal factory workers created the fitter's universal machine tool, the workers and technicians of the Shanghai Dafeng First Cotton Textile Factory cooperated under the direct leadership of the Party Committee Secretary to manufacture a combined textile machine that can directly turn raw cotton into textiles in ten minutes, a youth who did not finish junior high school explored and researched a method for preventing and eliminating termites and a theory of termite ecology, and a young agricultural technician successfully experimented with distant hybridization of rice and sorghum and grafting of rice and corn. These are all innovations. The steel spark inspection method and its theory created by young steel inspectors broke the conclusions of Japanese authoritative scholars; the locomotive electro-pneumatic brake invented by railway workers, which can stop the train in a short time, is the world's first.

Science has broken through the circle of a few experts and scholars and become the cause of the broad masses. This is a major feature of the Great Leap Forward in science. Science has always been considered mysterious and unpredictable, the masses superstitious about experts, and experts superstitious about foreigners. Only after the Party put forward the call to break superstitions, liberate thought, and the line of combining experts with the masses, did scientific institutions sprout and grow everywhere like spring grass throughout the country. In the first half of this year, the newly built research institutions at the prefecture, county, and city levels in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions totaled at least 1,400, together with the existing ones, reaching more than 1,700, with hundreds more under construction.

Science organs running factories in a big way is also a new thing in the leap forward. Taking the Chinese Academy of Sciences as an example, each research institute originally had 34 factories. In the Great Leap Forward, 111 were added. Among them, in addition to factories that manufacture instruments and materials for research work, there are also a large number of factories conducting intermediate experiments to promote research results into production. Research institutions running factories in a big way proves that the combination of science and technology with production practice has stepped onto a higher stage; this is an important measure to realize "science comes from production and then guides the improvement of production."

The great significance of the Great Leap Forward in science lies not only in obtaining a large number of valuable research results and strengthening the scientific ranks, but more importantly, the proletarian party has further developed its experience and art in leading science and technology. This Great Leap Forward shows how skillfully the Party has grasped the specific methods of giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system and following the mass line in leading and managing science and technology. These specific methods are to propose research topics based on socialist production tasks under unified national planning (while paying attention to exploratory research), liberate thought, break superstitions, exert full effort, cooperate closely, combine experts with the masses, and ultimately put politics in command, and let red lead specialized work. Only in this way can we jump to the peak of world science and technology with unprecedented high speed in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

Without a Production Leap Forward, There Would Be No Scientific Leap Forward

This great leap forward in science and technology has come along with the great leap forward in socialist production. Production has put forward a series of tasks for science and technology, promoting the leap forward in science and technology. For example, after farmers discovered that deep plowing can increase production, it prompted scientists to re-examine soil science and plant physiology, and to study deep plowing theory and technology. The Mechanical and Electrical Research Institute therefore worked hard for five days and nights to successfully trial-produce a vibrating tillage plow that can plow 53 centimeters deep. Capitalist countries do not yet have such advanced agricultural machinery.

The birth of the electron microscope is the result of the collaboration of research institutions, universities, various factories, and industrial departments in Changchun, Shenyang, and Shanghai. The Shenyang No. 1 Telecommunications Equipment Factory supported the most skilled workers and technicians in its factory to help the scientific institutions make this gift. Some units contributed their most valuable materials to support. No one considered whose credit it would be if this result was made. In the old society where "man dies for money; birds die for food," this selfless hard work and the spirit of cooperation of "one for all, all for one" were unimaginable. Many highly scientific results are the crystallization of the collective wisdom of experts and the masses. When manufacturing a universal tool microscope, a critical problem that could not be solved was encountered - the coil for winding the step-up transformer could not be made well. The director of the Optical Precision Machinery and Instrument Research Institute personally convened many technical research meetings and ran countless trips to the workshop, and the eyes of the relevant technicians were bloodshot for this reason. As a result, it was solved with the help and guidance of He Shouren, an old electrician at the Shenyang Hongyin Telecommunications Equipment Factory.

Because politics was put in command and the path of letting red lead specialized work was adopted, China's science has seen an unprecedented great leap forward. Many major achievements have been completed at an amazing speed. For example, the separation of all rare earth elements was a work originally scheduled to be completed in twelve years in the scientific plan, but it has now been completed many years ahead of schedule. Due to the major achievements of the Great Leap Forward, it is now confident that the national science and technology plan originally scheduled to be completed in twelve years can be completed five years ahead of schedule.

It can be firmly believed that the ever-victorious Party not only has mature experience in leading political, military, and economic work, but also has mature leadership experience and leadership art in science and technology. China becoming a strong country with advanced science and culture is just around the corner.

    祖国科学事业以划时代的速度前进
    先进的科学文化强国指日可待
    据新华社25日讯  近百年来中国科学技术落后于世界水平的状况不久将要一去不复返了！这几个月来科学技术大跃进中的奇迹使人们充满了这个信念。大跃进把中国科学推进了崭新的历史阶段。
    共产党对中国科学技术全面的、极具成效的领导；专家与群众相结合——一个全民办科学的运动开始形成；科学为生产服务，和实际结合；解放思想，鼓足干劲；实行共产主义大协作；沿着多快好省的道路前进。这一切，就是中国科学技术一日千里地跃进的最根本的原因。
    从事科学研究，几年几十年并不算长。但是中国人民竟在短促的时期内作出了大量有较高价值的科学技术成果，达到和超过世界先进水平的研究成果已经不是个别，而是到处可见。举如大功率高频半导体晶体管、具有特种优良性能的硅橡胶、二百多种永不褪色的活性染料、最好的尼龙——“尼龙9”，草类纤维人造丝、研究原子核物理的重要仪器“百道脉冲分析器”以及预防麻疹的组织疫苗等的制造成功；大气环流等基本理论的研究结果，全部十五种希土元素的分离，不用砖木钢骨水泥建筑房屋，水煤气合成石油，金霉素的高产技术，严重火伤的医疗成功……都是插在世界科学高峰上的红旗，有的是外国正在研究而没有做成的；有的在质量上超过了世界先进水平，有的在世界上还是首创。
    科学事业跳出了专家的圈子
    很多有重要价值的研究成果是没有受过高等学校教育甚至没有进过正规学校的普通劳动人民做出来的。例如原子能金工厂工人创造的钳工万能机床，上海达丰第一棉纺织厂工人和技术人员合作，在党委书记直接领导下制造出来的能在十分钟内使原棉直接变成纺织品的联合纺织机，一个没有念完初中的青年自己摸索钻研出来的防除白蚁的方法和白蚁生态学说，农业社的青年技术员试验成功的水稻高粱远缘杂交和水稻玉米嫁接等等，都是创举。青年钢铁检查工创立的钢铁火花检查法及其理论，打破了日本权威学者的结论；铁路工人制造的可在短时间内把火车煞住的机车电空制动器，是世界首创。
    科学事业已经突破少数专家学者的圈子，成为广大群众的事业。这是科学大跃进中的一大特色。科学一向被认为神秘莫测，群众迷信专家，专家迷信外国。只有在党提出了破除迷信、解放思想的号召和专家与群众结合的路线以后，科学机构就像春草一样在全国各处滋长发芽。在今年上半年内，各省市自治区新建的专区、县市以上一级的研究机构至少有一千四百多个，连同原有的，共达一千七百多个，还有数百个正在筹建。
    科学机关大办工厂，也是跃进中的新事。拿中国科学院来说，各研究所原先共有工厂三十四个，大跃进中增加了一百一十一个，其中除了为研究工作制造仪器、材料的工厂以外，还有大批为推广研究成果到生产中去而进行中间试验的工厂。研究机关大办工厂，证明科学技术结合生产实际已经跨上了更高的阶梯；这是实现“科学从生产中来，然后又指导生产的提高”的重要措施。
    科学大跃进的重大意义不仅在于得出了一大批有价值的研究成果和壮大了科学队伍，更重要的意义还在于无产阶级的党对于领导科学技术的经验和艺术有了进一步的发展。这次大跃进说明党对于领导管理科学技术是如何熟练地掌握了发挥社会主义制度优越性和遵循群众路线的具体方法。这些具体方法就是在全国统一筹划下，从社会主义生产任务出发提出研究课题（同时注意探索性研究），解放思想，破除迷信，鼓足干劲，通力协作，专家与群众结合，归根结蒂就是政治挂帅，以红带专。只有这样才能多快好省地以空前的高速度跳上世界科学技术的高峰。
    没有生产跃进，就没有科学跃进
    这次科学技术大跃进是伴随着社会主义生产大跃进而来的，生产向科学技术提出了一系列任务，推动了科学技术跃进。例如在农民发现深耕可以增产以后，就促使科学家去重新审查土壤学、植物生理学；去研究深耕理论和技术。机械电机研究所因此苦战五昼夜，试制成功可深耕五十三公分的振动式机耕犁，资本主义国家还没有这样先进的农业机械。
    电子显微镜的诞生，是长春、沈阳、上海等地的研究机关、高等学校、各类工厂和工业部门的协作产物，沈阳一电讯器材厂为了帮助科学机关制作这件礼物，支援了本厂的最熟练的工人和技术员。有的单位拿出了自己最宝贵的材料来支援。没有人考虑这项成果作出来是算谁的功劳。在“人不为己天诛地灭”的旧社会里，这种忘我的干劲和“我为人人”的协作精神是不能设想的。许多科学水平极高的成果，都是专家和群众集思广益的结晶。在制造万能工具显微镜的时候，碰到了一个不能解决的关键——缠升压器的线圈做不好。光学精密机械仪器研究所所长亲自召开了多次技术研究会，跑了多少趟车间，有关技术人员的眼睛为此熬红了。结果还是在沈阳宏音电讯器材厂老电工何守仁的帮助、指导下获得解决。
    由于政治挂了帅，采取了以红带专的途径，中国科学才出现了旷古未闻的大跃进。许多重大成果是以惊人速度完成的。如全部希土元素的分离，是科学规划中原定十二年完成的工作，现在提前许多年完成了。由于大跃进的重大成就，现在有把握提出把原定十二年完成的全国科学技术规划提前五年完成。
    可以深信，无往不胜的党，不但在领导政治、军事和经济工作方面已有成熟经验，对科学技术，也同样有了成熟的领导经验和领导艺术，中国成为一个有先进科学文化的强国，是指日可待的。
