Artificial Seahorse Farming Successfully Tested

　　The Shantou Special District of Guangdong Province is rich in seahorses, with the largest number found near Bizhou Island in Raoping County. Seahorses are a valuable medicinal ingredient, used for nourishing the kidneys, reducing inflammation, relieving pain, stopping bleeding, inducing labor, and strengthening the heart. They are particularly effective in treating neurasthenia.

　　The Chaoshan Marine Aquaculture Farm in Guangdong Province began artificial seahorse farming trials in 1957. Under artificial control, seahorses are able to fertilize, incubate, and rear their young. Last year, they bred 6,000 seahorse fry, some of which have grown into parent seahorses and have already produced fry five times.

　　Seahorses have a strong reproductive capacity and grow very quickly. Parent seahorses can reproduce two or three generations or more per year, producing fry more than ten times, with each batch yielding over a hundred fry.

　　Seahorse fry can be stocked two to three times a year, with each mu (unit of area) capable of stocking 75,000 to over 100,000 fry. The Shantou Special District plans to vigorously develop artificial seahorse farming this year.

　　人工试养海马成功
    广东省汕头专区盛产海马，其中以饶平县碧州岛附近最多。海马在医药上是贵重药物之一，可作补肾、消炎、止痛、止血、催生、强心等用，对于治疗神经衰弱更有卓效。
    广东省潮汕海水养殖场自1957年开始人工试养海马。海马在人工控制下，能够受精育儿孵化。去年繁殖海马苗六千尾，其中一部分海马已长成亲海马，并已育苗五次。
    海马繁殖能力很强，成长也很迅速。亲海马一年可繁殖二、三代以上，育苗十多次，每次产苗一百多尾。
    海马苗一年可放养二至三次，每次每亩可养七万五千尾至十万尾以上。汕头专区今年准备大力发展海马人工养殖事业。
