Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 28th -- In early September, Chairman Mao conducted a six-day inspection in Wuhan and Huangshi cities of Hubei Province, and made important instructions on issues such as steel production and higher education.

During the inspection, Chairman Mao attached great importance to steel production, making it the main inspection item. On the day of his arrival in Wuhan, he listened to a report by Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, on the province's steel production situation. Finally, Chairman Mao inspected a number of steel enterprises in Wuhan and Huangshi, including Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Daye Iron Mine Area, Daye Steel Plant, and the small blast furnace of Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill. During the inspection, Chairman Mao met with approximately 40,000 workers from the above-mentioned enterprises, praising their full revolutionary drive and creative spirit in vigorously developing steel production. During the inspection, he instructed that large enterprises like Wuhan Iron and Steel Company could gradually be developed into comprehensive joint enterprises, which, in addition to producing various steel products, should also engage in some mechanical industry, chemical industry, and construction industry. He also instructed that such large enterprises should have a bit of agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs in addition to industry. During the inspection of the Daye Iron Mine Area, Chairman Mao affirmed the contracting system implemented there during the capital construction process. After listening to the report of the person in charge of the mining area, he pointed out that it is better to adopt the contracting system for capital construction, which can greatly reduce construction costs.

During his stay in Wuhan, Chairman Mao also specially inspected Wuhan University and Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant. After the great rectification movement, both units showed many new features in production, construction, and teaching reform. After the rectification movement, the broad masses of teachers, students, and staff of Wuhan University greatly improved their socialist ideological awareness, actively implemented the policy of education serving politics and combining education with productive labor, and vigorously ran factories by combining indigenous and foreign methods, which greatly changed the face of the school. On this basis, the students consciously proposed the implementation of a part-work, part-study system. Chairman Mao believed that this approach of Wuhan University was very good during the inspection. He pointed out that it is a good thing for students to consciously demand the implementation of a part-work, part-study system, which is an inevitable trend for schools to vigorously run factories. Such requests can be approved and should be given active support and encouragement. He also instructed that attention should be paid to giving play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of teachers and students in teaching reform, and to concentrating the wisdom of the masses in many ways. During the inspection of Wuhan University, Chairman Mao also took special time to meet with more than 13,000 teachers, students, and staff from this school, Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Power, Wuhan Technical University of Surveying and Mapping, and the South-Central Branch of the Central Institute for Nationalities.

Chairman Mao also inspected the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant, and he attached great importance to the plant's practice of combining construction with production.

During his inspection in Wuhan and Huangshi, Chairman Mao also received all the representatives of the Party Congress of the PLA units stationed in Wuhan who were holding a meeting in Wuhan, and received representatives of advanced women in Wuhan; he received all the staff members of the Huangshi Municipal Party Committee; and took photos with the representatives of the Party Congress of the PLA units stationed in Wuhan and the staff members of the Huangshi Municipal Party Committee respectively. In Wuhan, Chairman Mao also received Lin Yishan, the person in charge of the Yangtze River Planning Office, listened to his report on the Three Gorges Project, and gave instructions. In addition, when Chairman Mao inspected Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant, he also received the Soviet experts who were helping with the work there and expressed his gratitude for their friendly assistance.

During Chairman Mao's inspection in Wuhan and Huangshi, Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, and Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Secretariat, often accompanied him. In addition, Song Kanfu, First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee, Yang Rui, First Secretary of the Huangshi Municipal Party Committee, Li Yiqing, General Manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, and Liu Yangqiao, First Secretary of the Party Committee and Vice President of Wuhan University, also accompanied him. Chairman Mao's inspection brought great encouragement to the people of the two cities. The people of the two cities, especially the cadres and masses of the inspected and received units, have expressed their determination to repay the encouragement and care of the great leader with newer achievements in production, construction, and study.

    他指出大型企业应逐步办成综合性企业
    应该积极支持和鼓励大学生半工半读
    新华社武汉28日电  9月上旬，毛主席在湖北省的武汉、黄石两市进行了为时六天的视察，并就钢铁生产和高等教育等问题作了重要的指示。
    毛主席在视察期间对钢铁生产很重视，把它作为主要的视察项目。到武汉的当天，他就听取了省委第一书记王任重关于全省钢铁生产情况的汇报，最后，毛主席分别在武汉、黄石视察了一批钢铁企业，计有武汉钢铁公司、大冶铁矿区、大冶钢厂和武昌第一纱厂的小高炉。视察过程中，毛主席和上述企业的大约四万名职工见了面，赞扬了他们在大办钢铁中所表现出的充沛的革命干劲和创造精神。在视察中他指示说，像武钢这样的大型企业，可以逐步地办成为综合性的联合企业，除生产多种钢铁产品外，还要办点机械工业、化学工业和建筑工业等。他还指示说，这样的大型企业，除工业外，农、商、学、兵都要有一点。在大冶铁矿区视察的时候，毛主席肯定了那里在进行基本建设过程中所实行的大包干的办法。他在听取了矿区负责人的汇报后指出，搞基本建设还是采用大包干的办法好，这样可以大大地降低建设成本。
    毛主席在武汉期间还专门视察了武汉大学和武汉重型机床厂。这两个单位经过伟大的整风运动后，在生产、建设和改革教学方面都出现了许多新气象。武汉大学的广大师生员工经过整风运动，社会主义的思想觉悟有了很大的提高，积极地贯彻了教育为政治服务，教育和劳动生产相结合的方针，采用土洋结合的办法大办工厂，使学校面貌大大改观；在此基础上，学生们自觉地提出了实行半工半读的要求。毛主席在视察时认为，武汉大学的这种做法很好。他指出，学生自觉地要求实行半工半读，这是好事情，是学校大办工厂的必然趋势，对这种要求可以批准，并应给他们以积极的支持和鼓励。他还指示在教学改革中应注意发挥广大师生的积极性，多方面的集中群众的智慧。在武汉大学视察时，毛主席还抽出专门时间，接见了这个学校和武汉水利学院、武汉测量制图学院、中央民族学院中南分院的一万三千多名师生员工。
