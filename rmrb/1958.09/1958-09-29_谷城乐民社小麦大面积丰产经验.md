Editor's Note: The time for sowing winter wheat in the northern regions has arrived. To help all regions learn from this year's wheat harvest experience and strive for an even greater harvest next year, we will publish some articles summarizing wheat high-yield experiences for reference.

	The Leminshe Agricultural Cooperative in Shenwan Township, Gucheng County, Hubei Province, achieved an average yield of 1,501 jin per mu on its entire 1,047 mu of wheat in 1958. Among them, the Fourth Production Team, which cultivated 119.8 mu of wheat, achieved an average yield of 2,401 jin per mu, earning the title of "Double Thousand Jin Team." Within this Double Thousand Jin Team, 9.5 mu achieved an average yield of over 3,000 jin per mu.

	The Leminshe Agricultural Cooperative is located on the south bank of the Han River, with fertile soil, a mild climate, and abundant rainfall. The main crops are wheat, cotton, corn, sesame, and rice, mostly double-cropped annually. The 119.8 mu of wheat cultivated by the Fourth Production Team consisted of 17 mu of sandy loam, 70.8 mu of loamy soil, 17 mu of yellow sandy soil, and 15 mu of gray soil. The sandy loam and loamy soil had a good balance of sand and clay and were considered first-class land. The yellow sandy soil was somewhat clayey, and the gray soil was somewhat sandy, and were considered second-class land.

	Before sowing wheat last year, a mass rectification campaign was carried out throughout the township, starting with a summary of production and a major debate on technological innovation, laying an ideological foundation for this year's general wheat harvest. Throughout the entire wheat growing season, the county party committee grasped important production links such as preserving seedlings, preserving ears, preserving grains, preventing drought and flooding, preventing frost damage, preventing diseases and pests, and preventing lodging, and organized four inspections. The township party committee resolutely implemented the county party committee's decisions and organized eight inspections. This was an important guarantee for urging all team members to exert their utmost efforts and strive for excellence, achieving an all-round harvest.

	The following is an introduction to the experience of the Fourth Production Team in achieving large-scale high-yield production.

	(1) Comprehensive Technological Revolution

	Lan Shijiang, the director of the Leminshe, created a high-yield record of 1,000 jin per mu of wheat in 1956 and 1957, pointing out the way for them to strive for large-scale high-yield wheat production. Through the major debate before wheat planting, they further recognized Lan Shijiang's main experiences in increasing production and the main shortcomings in the team's wheat production. These were: 1. Insufficient deep plowing. Local areas have always practiced shallow plowing. In recent years, the depth of plowing in the team has increased to four to five cun, but this is still two to three cun less than Lan Shijiang's seven cun deep plowing for the 1,000-jin wheat. 2. Insufficient density. In the past, broadcast sowing or spot sowing was used, with only 60,000 to 70,000 plants per mu. In recent years, strip planting with close spacing has been promoted, increasing the sowing amount to 17 jin, with row spacing of four to five cun and sowing width of two to three cun, with about 170,000 plants per mu. However, compared with Lan Shijiang's 22 jin of seeds per mu, row spacing of three cun, sowing width of four cun, and more than 300,000 plants per mu, this was too sparse, and the number of plants and ears was insufficient, limiting the increase in yield. 3. Insufficient fertilization. The amount of fertilizer applied in 1956 and 1957 was two-thirds to one times less than the fertilizer applied by Lan Shijiang for 1,000-jin wheat per mu. 4. The sowing period was too long, and some wheat was sown too early. Local habits are to sow wheat over three months, starting before the Cold Dew solar term and continuing until the Minor Snow solar term. In 1956, some of the team's wheat was sown six days before the Cold Dew, and many seedlings froze to death. Some that were delayed until the Beginning of Winter solar term had reduced tillering, sparse and weak seedlings. Whether sown early or late, yields were lower than those sown at the appropriate time, thus affecting the team's average yield. Lan Shijiang's 1,000-jin wheat was sown two or three days before the Frost's Descent solar term, with moderate tillering and strong growth, and did not suffer frost damage after jointing. 5. Rainfall gradually decreases after September in the local area, and autumn drought easily occurs in double-cropped land. In the past, due to untimely soil preparation and harrowing, the clods were large, and the soil moisture was insufficient, seriously affecting the emergence of wheat seedlings.

	Based on the results of the above debate, the team decided to comprehensively improve wheat cultivation techniques and raised the wheat production target to 1,500 jin per mu.

	The team's main technical measures were as follows:

	1. Carefully select large-grained wheat seeds. Before the wheat harvest in the previous year, they selected seeds in the field by ear and block, threshed them separately, and then wind-selected them to eliminate lighter and smaller wheat grains. After seed selection, they sprayed each 100 jin of seeds with three liang of "666" insecticide powder, and the storage enclosure was also disinfected with insecticide powder to prevent insect infestation. They sun-dried the seeds three times during the dog days. Half a month before wheat sowing, they sun-dried the seeds twice more, and sprayed "666" powder three times in conjunction with sun-drying during the dog days. Two days before wheat sowing, they selected seeds with muddy water, removing five to six jin of small-grained wheat seeds from every 100 jin of seeds. Through such careful seed selection, the purity of the team's wheat varieties was greatly improved, and the germination rate also reached over 95%. The seeds were plump and large, with about 12,000 grains per jin, laying a good material foundation for ensuring full and strong seedlings and obtaining high-yield production.

	2. All wheat land was plowed four times. The first time was after the previous crop was harvested, using a double-share plow to cut the stubble, plowing to a depth of five cun, followed by harrowing twice. The second time was using a double-share plow and an old-style plow in tandem, plowing to a depth of 7.5 cun, followed by harrowing twice. The third time was still using a double-share plow and an old-style plow in tandem, plowing to a depth of 7.5 cun, followed by harrowing twice. The fourth time was using a double-share plow to a depth of six cun, followed by harrowing twice. In terms of plowing methods, the first time was straight plowing and horizontal harrowing, the second time was horizontal plowing and straight harrowing, the third time was straight plowing and horizontal harrowing again, and the fourth time was horizontal plowing and straight harrowing again. They believed that such cross plowing and harrowing could comprehensively cultivate the soil, leaving no hidden ridges, which would be more conducive to soil fragmentation, moisture retention, and the growth of wheat roots. Last year, there was an autumn drought in the local area, and many wheat fields were sown after watering. Although the Double Thousand Jin Team was late-stubble land, it retained considerable moisture due to timely harrowing. Not only did they not need to combat drought during sowing, but the soil was also broken and leveled, and seedlings emerged uniformly seven or eight days after sowing.

	3. Sowing at the appropriate time with wide spacing and dense planting. Last year, the team's wheat was sown from October 20th to 25th, completing all sowing, shortening the sowing period by more than half a month compared to previous years, achieving sowing at the appropriate time. Therefore, although there was plenty of fertilizer and water, the wheat seedlings were not overly vigorous, nor did they bolt. The team's sowing amount also increased from an average of 17 jin last year to 27.5 jin, and appropriate arrangements were made based on stubble and soil preparation conditions: corn stubble was harvested early, the soil clods were fine, and the soil moisture was good, so 25 jin were sown per mu; cotton stubble was harvested later, the soil clods were larger, and the soil moisture was poorer, so 29 jin were sown per mu; rice stubble had sticky soil with large clods and many missing seedlings, so 32 jin were sown. The high-yield experimental fields were increased to 34 jin per mu. In terms of sowing methods, they also changed the previous row spacing of four to five cun and sowing width of two to three cun to row spacing of three cun and sowing width of four to five cun to increase the sowing area, making the seeds evenly distributed, fully ventilated and transparent to light, with strong stems, preventing lodging.

	They fully understood that only by having a large and sufficient number of seedlings could they obtain a reliable guarantee for high-yield production. Therefore, six to seven days after the wheat emerged, they checked the seedlings and carried out accelerated germination and replanting in wheat fields with missing seedlings. The team accelerated germination and replanted a total of 100 jin of seeds. In addition, they specially cultivated two mu of wheat seedlings and carried out a second replanting and transplanting of seedlings in wheat fields with missing seedlings, watering and fertilizing with water and manure immediately after transplanting, and watering and fertilizing with water and manure again a week later to promote catching up with the growth of ordinary wheat seedlings.

	Due to sowing at the appropriate time, rational close planting, and eliminating missing seedlings, the team's wheat had an average of about 600,000 seedlings before the new year and about 680,000 to 700,000 seedlings after spring, with an average of 582,000 ears per mu at harvest. The high-yield fields had 950,000 seedlings before the new year and 1.1 million seedlings after spring, with 1.07 million ears per mu at harvest. This was an important guarantee for achieving an average yield of 2,401 jin per mu for the entire team.

	4. Applying sufficient base fertilizer, topdressing at the full moon stage, and foliar spraying with phosphorus. The team applied an average of 65,000 jin of cow manure and old wall soil per mu as base fertilizer, which was incorporated into the soil in conjunction with the second, third, and fourth soil preparations. At the time of sowing, they also applied 22,700 jin of decomposed cow manure, 22 jin of sesame cake, 15 jin of bone meal, and 9 jin of ammonium sulfate as seed fertilizer. These fertilizers contained both quick-acting fertilizers and slow-acting fertilizers, which could continuously supply the needs of wheat from seedlings to maturity.

	Around the full moon of the wheat seedlings, when there were one or two tillers, they applied 13,000 jin of decomposed human manure per mu along the ridges to promote wheat tillering and rooting, consciously cultivating effective tillers before the new year. According to measurements at harvest, general fields had four to five effective tillers, and high-yield fields had five to six. The team's wheat began to joint around March 15th. During the wheat overwintering and greening period on December 20th and March 1st, they applied two more winter fertilizers, applying a total of 10,000 jin of wall soil, 5,000 jin each of decomposed cow manure and human manure, 13 jin of ammonium sulfate, and 5 jin of sesame cake per mu. This period was the differentiation period of wheat spikelets and florets. Sufficient fertilization could prolong the differentiation time and increase the number of spikelets and florets. Therefore, although there was high-density planting with an average of 582,000 ears per mu, each ear still had an average of 46 grains.

	The wall soil and cow manure they used contained large amounts of phosphorus. When the spikelets had just emerged, they also used 2.5 jin of superphosphate and 0.5 jin of ammonium sulfate mixed with 400 jin of water per mu as foliar topdressing. Therefore, not only was the number of ears per mu high and the number of grains per ear high, but the seeds were also full and large, with only 11,500 grains per jin.

	Because they mastered the application of more organic fertilizer and less chemical fertilizer; applying sufficient base fertilizer and early topdressing; stopping the application of quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer after jointing; and the comprehensive application of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers, only two mu of the team's wheat that was originally on the site of a house foundation lodged, while the rest did not. The base fertilizer in the high-yield fields reached 108,300 jin of cow manure and wall soil, and the topdressing, wall soil, human manure, and dregs manure reached 81,000 jin, and lodging did not occur either.

	5. Strengthening seed treatment and timely preventing and controlling diseases and pests. Wireworms, mole crickets, wheat aphids, wheat spider mites, and loose smut disease are the main wheat diseases and pests in the local area. To prevent and control these diseases and pests and ensure a good harvest, they soaked the seeds in warm water (two parts boiling water and one part cool water) before wheat sowing to prevent loose smut disease. After drying, they mixed the seeds with "666" insecticide powder to prevent underground pests. On January 28th and March 21st, they sprayed DDT and "1605" twice to prevent wheat aphids and wheat spider mites. Therefore, they did not suffer from diseases and pests throughout the entire wheat growing season.

	(2) Putting Politics in Command and Implementing Production Increase Measures to the End

	The leaders of this commune fully understand that having production increase targets and having measures and plans does not mean that the production increase plan has been completed. To turn the plan into reality and get the increased grain into their hands, much hard work is still needed. The most important of these is to mobilize the masses, get their thinking in order, muster their energy, strive for the upper reaches, and resolutely implement the various production increase measures to the end. Their experience is:

	First, break superstitions, liberate thinking, dare to think and dare to do, and encourage everyone to start experimental fields. To cultivate typical examples, establish banners, drive the general, and solve the fertilizer problem in high-yield areas, they also mobilized commune members to invest individually in experimental fields. The increased portion of the experimental fields was awarded to individuals in proportion (20%), and the investment was returned after the wheat harvest. This greatly encouraged the enthusiasm and drive of the masses and laid the foundation for comprehensive production increase. The team cultivated a total of 31 mu of experimental fields, accounting for about 25% of the team's wheat fields, investing more than 120 yuan. These experimental fields generally yielded more than 2,500 jin per mu, with 9.5 mu yielding more than 3,000 jin per mu, and the highest nine fen yielding the equivalent of more than 4,000 jin per mu.

	Second, conduct competitions at each stage and carry out red flag competitions. They summarized the experience of carrying out red flag competitions in previous years and found that evaluating once at the wheat harvest only promoted the production of the next year and did not play a role in the production of the current year. Therefore, starting with soil preparation in the autumn of 1957, they combined the county party committee's four major production inspections and three 100-dan fertilizer campaigns to compare plowing depth, harrowing for moisture retention, and the quantity and quality of base fertilizer during wheat soil preparation; compare sowing time and planting density during wheat sowing; compare uniform emergence and full seedlings after wheat emergence; and compare seedling fertilizer and strong seedlings and eliminate three types of seedlings in spring. They resolutely implemented the county party committee's decision, linking one link to another, one upsurge after another, blocking all possible loopholes in the wheat growth stage, and enabling the evaluation campaign to play a realistic role in increasing production in the current year.

	To encourage the enthusiasm of the masses, further reward the advanced, and drive the backward, they adopted a method of rewards and punishments. It was stipulated that those who received a red flag in each evaluation would be awarded five yuan, and the money from the award would be used to buy fertilizer to further increase production. Those who failed to win a red flag three times would be fined five yuan. Encouraged by this red flag competition campaign, all team members were full of energy, enabling the team's wheat production to develop in a balanced manner and achieve large-scale high-yield production.

	Third, insert red flags into thinking, and debate if there is no understanding. When implementing production increase measures, they encountered many ideological obstacles: when preparing the soil, the branch committee proposed using a double-share plow in tandem to plow to a depth of 7.5 cun. Some team members did not understand and said, "Plowing no more than three cun of soil, plowing too deep will cause the wheat to turn yellow and not grow." When sowing, the branch committee proposed a sowing width of four cun and a row spacing of three cun, with an average sowing amount of 27 jin per mu. Some commune members said, "Sow one sheng, reap one shi, sow one dou, and don't see it again." Major debates were launched in the team on these conservative ideas until they were understood.

	They realized that any new thing would encounter the obstruction of conservative ideas; that technical revolution would always encounter resistance from some people. However, they firmly believed in the majority of the masses and believed that as long as they relied on the masses and seriously solved ideological problems, new production increase measures could be implemented to the end. In fact, this was the case. Through debate, the thinking of the masses was improved, and the sense of responsibility of the masses was strengthened. A small number who still did not understand after the debate and were not resolute in implementing production increase measures encountered the supervision of the masses. For example, when sowing wheat, team member Zhang Shifa widened the row spacing by one cun, and team members Feng Cuiying and Wu Zhiying did not scatter enough seeds; when preparing the soil, team member Wang Anhu did not harrow immediately after plowing. All these were exposed by the masses, and they reworked it through debate.

	In addition, the branch committee also organized a four-person inspection team to check the implementation of production increase measures by team members at each stage to further strengthen supervision and ensure quality.

    谷城乐民社小麦大面积丰产经验
    编者按：北方地区播种冬麦的时期已经到了。为了帮助各地吸取今年小麦丰收经验，争取明年更大丰收，我们将发表
    一些总结小麦丰产经验的文章，供各地参考。
    湖北省谷城县沈湾乡乐民农业社1958年全社一千零四十七亩小麦，平均亩产一千五百零一斤。其中第四生产队共种一百一十九点八亩小麦，平均亩产二千四百零一斤，获得了双千斤队的称号。在这个双千斤队里，并有九点五亩平均亩产在三千斤以上。
    乐民农业社位于汉水南岸，土壤肥沃，气候温和，雨量充沛，作物以小麦、棉花、玉米、芝麻、水稻为主，多为一年二熟。第四生产队所种的一百一十九点八亩小麦，其中油沙土十七亩，两合土七十点八亩，黄沙土十七亩，灰色土十五亩。油沙土和两合土，沙粘适中，为头等土地。黄沙土偏粘，灰色土偏沙，为二等土地。
    去年小麦播种前，全乡开展了群众性的整风运动，从总结生产入手，开展了技术革新的大辩论，为今年小麦普遍丰收打下了思想基础。在整个小麦生长时期，县委又抓住保株、保穗、保粒、防旱涝、防冻害、防病虫、防倒伏等重要生产环节，组织四次检查。乡党委坚决贯彻县委决议，组织了八次检查。这是督促全体队员鼓足干劲、力争上游，获得全面丰收的重要保证。
    下面介绍的，是第四生产队取得大面积丰产的经验。
    （一）全面进行技术革命
    乐民社主任蓝世江1956、1957两年连创造小麦亩产千斤的丰产纪录，为他们争取小麦大面积丰产指出了途径。通过种麦前的大辩论，他们进一步认识到蓝世江的主要增产经验和全队小麦生产中的主要缺点。这就是：一、深耕不够。当地历年都是浅耕，近年来全队耕地深度加深到四到五寸，但与蓝世江的千斤小麦深耕七寸比较还差二、三寸。二、密度不够，过去都是撒播或点播，每亩只六、七万株。近年来推行条播密植，播种量增加到十七斤，行距四、五寸，播幅二、三寸，每亩约十七万株，但和蓝世江的每亩下种二十二斤、行距三寸、播幅四寸、每亩三十多万株比较，就显得太稀，株、穗数都不够，限制了产量的提高。三、施肥不足。1956年、1957年施肥量和蓝世江千斤小麦每亩施肥比较，还相差三分之二到一倍。四、播种期拖延太长，部分小麦播种过早。当地习惯是麦种三个月，从寒露前起开始种麦，一直种到小雪。1956年队里有部分在寒露前六天播种的，冻死很多；部分延迟到立冬播种的，则分蘖减少，苗稀苗弱。不论早播或晚播的都比适期播种的减产，从而影响了全队的平均产量。而蓝世江的千斤小麦在霜降前二、三天播种，分蘖适中；生长健壮，又没有拔节受冻。五、当地9月份以后降雨逐渐减少，在二熟地容易发生秋旱。过去由于整地耙?不及时，土垡很大，水分不足，严重影响麦苗出土。
    根据以上辩论结果，全队决心全面改进小麦栽培技术，并将小麦生产指标提高到亩产一千五百斤。
    全队的主要技术措施有以下几项：
    一、精选大粒麦种。头年小麦收获前，他们在田间穗选、块选的种籽，单独扬场，又进行风选，淘汰比较轻的和小的麦粒。选种后每一百斤种籽喷三两“666”药粉，贮藏用的围席也用药粉消毒，以防虫蛀。在伏天进行三次晒种，小麦播种前半月，又晒种二次，结合伏天晒种又喷“666”粉三次。小麦播种前二天用泥水选种，每百斤种籽剔除小粒麦种五、六斤。经过这样精细选种，全队小麦品种纯度大大提高，发芽率也达到95％以上，种籽粒粒肥大，每斤约合一万二千粒，为保证苗全苗壮和获得高额丰产打下了良好的物质基础。
    二、全部麦地都作到了犁四次。第一次在前作收获后用双铧犁灭茬，犁深五寸，随犁随耙二遍；第二次用双铧犁和旧式犁套犁，犁深七点五寸，随犁随耙二遍；第三次仍用双铧犁和旧犁套犁，犁深七点五寸，随犁随耙二遍；第四次用双铧犁犁深六寸，仍耙二遍。在犁的方法上是第一次直犁、横耙，第二次横犁、直耙，第三次又是直犁、横耙，第四次又是横犁、直耙。他们认为这样交叉犁耙，可以全面耕翻土壤，不留暗埂，更有利于碎土保墒和小麦根系生长。去年当地秋旱，很多小麦田都是担水浇地播种的。双千斤队虽然都是晚茬地，由于及时耙地保住了相当水分，非但没有抗旱播种，而且土碎地平，播种后七、八天即齐苗。
    三、适期播种，宽幅密植。去年全队小麦在10月20日播种至25日全部种完，比往年缩短了半个多月，做到了适期播种。因此，虽然在肥多水足的情况下，麦苗没有过旺，也没有拔节。全队的播种量也由去年的平均十七斤增加到二十七斤五两，并根据茬口和整地情况，作了适当安排：玉米茬收获早，土块细，墒情好，每亩播种二十五斤；棉花茬收获较晚，土块较大，墒情较差，每亩播种二十九斤；水稻茬土粘垡大、缺苗多，播种三十二斤。高额丰产试验地则增加到每亩三十四斤。在播种方法上也改变去年行距四、五寸，播幅二、三寸为行距三寸，播幅四到五寸，以增加播种面积；使种籽分布均匀，充分通气透光，茎秆健壮，防止倒伏。
    他们充分了解到只有拥有大量的和足够的苗数，才是获得丰产的可靠保证。因此在小麦出苗后六、七天进行了查苗，对缺苗麦田实行催芽补种。全队小麦共催芽补种一百斤种籽。另外又专门培育了二亩麦苗，对缺苗麦地进行第二次补苗移栽，并随栽随浇水粪，移栽后一星期再浇一次水粪，促使赶上一般麦苗生长。
    由于适期播种，合理密植和消灭了缺苗现象，全队小麦在年前平均约有六十万苗，春后约有六十八到七十万苗，收获时平均每亩有五十八万二千穗。高额丰产田年前有九十五万苗，春后有一百一十万苗，收获时每亩有一百零七万穗。这是达到全队平均亩产二千四百零一斤的重要保证。
    四、施足基肥，满月追肥，根外喷磷。全队每亩平均施基肥牛栏肥和陈墙土六万五千斤，结合第二、三、四次整地翻入土中。在播种时又施种肥腐熟牛栏粪二万二千七百斤，麻饼二十二斤，骨粉十五斤，硫酸铵九斤，这些肥料中既有速效性的肥料，也有迟效性的肥料，可以从幼苗开始，不断地供应小麦的需要，直到成熟。
    在小麦满月前后开始有一、二个分蘖时，每亩又顺垄浇腐熟人粪尿一万三千斤，以促使小麦分蘖扎根，有意识地培养年前有效分蘖。根据收获时的测算，一般田有效分蘖为四、五个，高额丰产地达到五、六个。全队小麦在3月15日左右开始拔节。在12月20日和3月1日小麦越冬返青期间，又追了两次腊肥。每亩共追墙土一万斤，腐熟牛栏粪人粪尿各五千斤，硫酸铵十三斤，芝麻饼五斤。这一期间正是小麦小穗和小花分化时期，充分施肥可以使分化时间延长，小穗和小花数目增多，因之，虽然在高度密植每亩平均有五十八万二千穗的情况下，平均每穗还有四十六粒。
    他们施用的墙土和牛栏粪中都含有大量的磷。在小穗刚出穗时，每亩又用二斤半过磷酸钙和半斤硫酸铵兑水四百斤作根外追肥。所以不仅每亩的穗数多，每穗的籽粒多，而且种籽饱满，颗粒肥大，每斤只有一万一千五百粒。
    由于他们掌握了多施有机肥，少施化肥；施足基肥，早施追肥；拔节以后停止施速效性氮肥；和全面的配合施用氮、磷、钾肥料，所以全队小麦只有二亩田原是屋基地发生倒伏外，其余均未倒伏。高额丰产地基肥达到牛栏肥和墙土十万八千三百斤，追肥、墙土、人粪、渣子粪八万一千斤，也未发生倒伏。
    五、加强种籽处理，及时防治病虫。金针虫、蝼蛄、麦蚜、麦蜘蛛和散黑穗病是当地的主要小麦病虫害。为了防治这些病虫害，确保丰收，在小麦播种前用二开一凉的温汤浸种，防治黑穗病。晾干后再用“666”药粉拌种，防治地下害虫，在1月28日和3月21日又二次喷滴滴涕和“1605”，防止麦蚜、麦蜘蛛。因此在整个小麦生长期间，没有遭受病虫害。
    （二）政治挂帅，将增产措施贯彻到底
    这个社的领导上充分了解有了增产指标，有了措施规划，并不等于已经完成了增产计划。要把计划变成事实，把增产粮食拿到手里，还需要做许多艰苦的工作。其中最重要的是发动群众，搞通思想，鼓足干劲，力争上游，将各项增产措施坚决的贯彻到底。他们的经验是：
    第一、破除迷信、解放思想、敢想敢做、鼓励大家动手搞试验地。为了培养典型，树立旗帜，带动一般和解决丰产地的肥料问题，他们还发动社员个人投资搞试验。试验地增产部分按比例（20％）奖给个人，麦收后并退还投资。这样做大大地鼓舞了群众的干劲、钻劲，为全面增产打下了基础。全队共搞试验地三十一亩，约占全队小麦田25％，投资一百二十多元，这些试验地一般亩产二千五百斤以上，有九点五亩亩产在三千斤以上，最高的九分地，合亩产四千多斤。
    第二、搞一段比一段，开展红旗竞赛。他们总结了历年开展红旗竞赛的经验，发现在麦收时评比一次，只能推动下一年的生产，对当年生产没有发挥作用。于是从1957年秋季整地起，他们结合县委的四次生产大检查和三次百担肥运动，在小麦整地时比犁地深度，比耙地保墒，比基肥数量、质量；在小麦播种时比播种时间，比密植程度；小麦出苗以后，比齐苗、全苗；春季又比苗肥、苗壮，消灭三类苗。他们坚决贯彻了县委决议，一环套一环，一个高潮接一个高潮，堵塞了小麦生长阶段可能发生的各个漏洞，使评比运动在当年就发挥增产的现实作用。
    为了鼓动群众干劲，进一步奖励先进，带动落后，并采取了有奖有罚的办法。规定每次评比插上红旗的奖五元，得奖的钱用来买肥料，以进一步提高产量。三次评不上红旗的则罚五元。在这种红旗竞赛运动的鼓舞下，全体的队员干劲冲天，使全队的小麦生产得到了平衡的发展，获得了大面积的高额丰产。
    第三、思想插红旗，不通就辩论。在贯彻增产措施时，他们遇到许多思想障碍：整地时分支部提出用双铧犁套犁，深耕七点五寸。有的队员思想不通，说：“犁无三寸土，犁深了小麦发黄不长”。在播种时分支部提出播幅四寸行距三寸，平均每亩播种量二十七斤。有的社员说：“种一升，收一石，种一斗，不见面”。对于这些保守思想在队里都展开了大辩论，直到辩通为止。
    他们认识到任何新鲜事物，都会碰到保守思想的阻挡；要闹技术革命，也总会遇到一些人的抗拒。但他们坚决相信群众的多数，相信只要依靠群众，认真解决思想问题，新的增产措施是可以贯彻到底的。事实上也是如此。通过辩论，群众的思想提高了，群众的责任心加强了；少数经过辩论思想仍然不通，贯彻增产措施不坚决的，都遇到了群众的监督。如小麦播种时队员张世发把行距放宽了一寸，队员冯翠英、吴之英撒籽不够；整地时队员王安虎没有随犁随耙，都被群众揭发了，通过辩论又重新返工。
    此外，分支部还组织了四人检查组，在各阶段检查队员增产措施贯彻情况，以进一步加强监督，保证质量。
