Xinhua News Agency, September 14th -- King Suramarit of Cambodia wrote to Premier Zhou, thanking the Chinese government and people for their warm reception of Prince Sihanouk and the Cambodian Royal National Delegation. The letter is as follows:

His Excellency Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Beijing,

Mr. Premier,

Queen Kossamak and I extend our deepest gratitude to Your Excellency for the particularly warm and friendly reception given by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people to Prime Minister Norodom Sihanouk and the members of the Cambodian delegation during their recent official visit to China.

This affection and meticulous care shown to the Prince and his delegation will inevitably further strengthen the friendship between China and Cambodia, although this friendship is already very solid. Such an exceptional reception demonstrates to other countries in the world the level of mutual trust and brotherly friendship that our generations-old relationship has now reached.

Queen Kossamak and I would also like to warmly thank His Excellency Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese government for the gifts they bestowed upon us, which delighted us greatly.

Finally, we would like to express our gratitude for the kind reception and loving care Your Excellency extended to our grandchildren, Princess Norodom Buppha Devi and Prince Norodom Chakrapong, during their visit to China.

Mr. Premier, please accept my highest respect and profound esteem.

		Norodom Suramarit (signature)
		Phnom Penh Royal Palace, September 6, 1958
