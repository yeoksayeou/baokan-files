Xinhua News Agency report: The Baotou Steel Plant, currently under construction, completed the construction of a small 80-cubic-meter blast furnace on the 14th and put it into production. This small blast furnace can produce 100 tons of iron per day.

The Baotou Steel Plant is a medium-sized iron and steel complex established in Baotou City. After the completion of the first phase of the project next year, the annual production capacity will reach 500,000 tons of iron, 350,000 tons of steel, and nearly 300,000 tons of various steel products.

The construction of this steel plant began in the spring of this year. Prior to this, two small 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces had been completed and produced iron in July.

Xinhua News Agency report: The newly built No. 5 blast furnace of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company produced its first batch of iron at noon on the 9th.

After this medium-sized blast furnace is put into production, it can increase the current pig iron output of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company by more than one-third, which will strongly guarantee the realization of the company's leap forward plan this year. This blast furnace was designed by Chinese engineering and technical personnel themselves. The unloading, screening, weighing, and charging processes are all mechanized.

Xinhua News Agency report: A 55-cubic-meter blast furnace in the newly built Taiyuan No. 2 Steel Plant has been put into production and has begun to produce iron.

This plant was built through the joint cooperation of more than 30 factories and mining units. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant undertook the construction design and all tasks of this plant, and cast the boilers and other equipment needed for the two 55-cubic-meter blast furnaces.

After the Taiyuan No. 2 Steel Plant is fully completed by 1960, it will have more than ten workshops for iron smelting, steel making, steel rolling, sheet metal, and seamless steel pipes. The initial plan is to produce 300,000 tons of steel and 150,000 tons of iron annually.

The Lanzhou Chemical Plant has built a small steel plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons and has already produced steel. The workers are working day and night to step up production and strive to produce 25,000 tons of steel by the end of the year.

    包头钢铁厂  马鞍山钢铁公司  太原第二钢铁厂新建高炉出铁
    据新华社讯　正在建设中的包头钢铁厂，14日建成一座八十立方公尺的小高炉并投入生产。这个小高炉每天可出铁一百吨。
    包头钢铁厂是包头市开办的中型钢铁联合企业，第一期工程在明年建成后，年产能力可达到铁五十万吨，钢三十五万吨，各种钢材近三十万吨。
    这个钢铁厂是在今年春季开始建设的。在此以前，已有两座十三立方公尺的小高炉在7月间建成出铁。
    据新华社讯　马鞍山钢铁公司新建的五号高炉在9日中午炼出了第一炉铁。
    这座中型高炉投入生产以后，可以把马鞍山钢铁公司现在的生铁产量提高三分之一以上，有力地保证这个公司今年生产跃进计划的实现。这座高炉是我国工程技术人员自己设计的。它的卸料、筛料、称料和上料等运输过程全部机械化。
    据新华社讯　新建太原第二钢铁厂一座五十五立方公尺的高炉已经投入生产，开始出铁。
    这个厂是由三十多个厂矿单位共同协作建设的。太原钢铁厂担负这个厂的施工设计和全部任务，并铸造了两座五十五立方公尺高炉所需的锅炉等设备。
    太原第二钢铁厂到1960年全部建成后，将拥有炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、薄板和无缝钢管等十多个车间，初步计划每年能生产三十万吨钢和十五万吨铁。
