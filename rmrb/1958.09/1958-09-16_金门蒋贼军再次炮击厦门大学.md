Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, September 15th. On the morning of the 14th, the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen Island, once again shelled Xiamen University, wounding Yan Qianpei, a teaching assistant at the Nanyang Research Institute of Xiamen University, and Jiang Danhua, a freshman in the Mechanical Engineering Department of the Engineering College, as well as nearby farmers Chen Quancheng, Lin Bizhu, and shepherd boy Ke Shengfa, and killing seven head of cattle.

The crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched in Jinmen, supported by the American aggressors, in repeatedly shelling our cultural and educational institutions and peaceful residents, have aroused great indignation among all teachers and students of Xiamen University and overseas Chinese at home and abroad.
