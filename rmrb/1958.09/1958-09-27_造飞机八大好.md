Eight Great Benefits of Building Airplanes
Bai Yongnian, Sheet Metal Worker, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics

　　Building airplanes, first great benefit, political significance is truly immense, imperialists are scared out of their wits, the motherland's status is greatly enhanced.
　　Building airplanes, second great benefit, conservatism and inferiority are completely overthrown, today we can build airplanes, tomorrow satellites will soar into the clouds.
　　Building airplanes, third great benefit, our thinking must be transformed, intellectuals become workers and peasants, forever unswerving for the people.
　　Building airplanes, fourth great benefit, theory and practice are combined, past empty-headed theorists, are exposed in the face of reality.
　　Building airplanes, fifth great benefit, scientific research has a goal. Thinking back to the past is truly laughable, searching for research topics in magazines.
　　Building airplanes, sixth great benefit, teaching quality is greatly improved, lectures are substantial and specific, learning more, and remembering firmly.
　　Building airplanes, seventh great benefit, training cadres is truly important, regardless of design or construction, a great leap forward in both literary and martial skills.
　　Eighth great benefit, the benefits are great, teachers, students, and staff become one family. Communist cooperation, collectivism blossoms.

    造飞机八大好
    北京航空学院钣金工  柏永年造飞机，一大好，政治意义真不小，帝国主义吓破胆，祖国地位大提高。造飞机，二大好，保守自卑全打倒，今天咱能造飞机，明天卫星上云霄。造飞机，三大好，咱们思想得改造，知识分子工农化，永为人民不动摇。造飞机，四大好，理论实际结合了，过去空头理论家，实际面前现眼了。造飞机，五大好，科学研究有目标。想起从前真可笑，研究题目要到杂志里找。造飞机，六大好，教学质量大提高，讲课充实又具体，学得多，又记得牢。造飞机，七大好，锻炼干部真重要，不管设计与施工，能文能武大飞跃。八大好，好处大，师生员工成一家。共产主义大协作，集体主义开了花。
