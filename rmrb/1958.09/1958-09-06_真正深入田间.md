In order to strive for a large-scale high-yield harvest of late rice, Zhejiang Province has organized one million cadres from six levels to go deep into the fields, working and laboring while working. This is a very good method. Cadres eating in the fields, living in the fields, working and laboring in the fields, can discover problems in a timely manner and lead the masses to solve them on the spot. Treat insects if there are insects, fight drought if there is drought, treat diseases if there are diseases... all unfavorable factors hindering increased production are eliminated in a timely manner, and greater victories will inevitably be achieved. This leadership method enables the vast number of cadres to be more closely connected with reality, and will certainly be more welcomed by the masses.

    真正深入田间
    浙江省为了争取晚稻大面积高额丰产，组织六级干部百万人深入田间，一面劳动，一面工作，这是个很好的方法。干部吃在田间、住在田间、劳动、工作在田间，就能及时发现问题，及时领导群众就地解决。有虫治虫，有旱抗旱，有病治病……，一切妨碍增产的不利因素都及时消除了，必然能够取得更大的胜利。这种领导方法，使得广大干部更加密切地联系实际，也一定更能得到群众的欢迎。
