Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: The people of the old revolutionary base areas, rich in revolutionary struggle experience and glorious traditions, are responding to U.S. imperialist military provocations with practical actions such as stepping up production and vigorously building the old base areas.

Before liberation, the people of the old revolutionary base areas suffered from the Kuomintang reactionaries and Japanese imperialists' cruel attacks and massacres. Some old base areas even suffered the massacres and devastation of U.S. invading troops. After liberation, under the leadership and care of the Communist Party, they not only rapidly recovered from their wounds, but also developed the economy of the old base areas, living a peaceful and happy life. When they heard the news of U.S. imperialist military provocations against our country, they were extremely angry, and they all accused the U.S. invading troops and the Kuomintang reactionaries of their heinous crimes, and they were determined to turn hatred into strength, bringing out the same vigor as they did when they enthusiastically joined the army and supported the front lines, to support the liberation of Jinmen and Matsu, and to support the liberation of Taiwan.

After the revolutionary old base areas of Nancheng and Lichuan counties in Jiangxi Province held anti-aggression demonstrations, the people rose up and fought day and night by the iron smelting furnaces, causing the output of pig iron to rise sharply. By the 12th, the output was one to two times higher than in the previous period. In Ganxian County, 330,000 people have been mobilized and are working with soaring enthusiasm to eliminate third-class late rice seedlings and fully realize first-class rice seedlings. After the demonstration in Nankang County, eighteen production corps were immediately organized, led by veteran Red Army fighters and cadres, fighting day and night in the fields.

"Smelt more steel, produce more grain, and resolutely strike down the American wolves" has become the action slogan of the people in the old revolutionary base area of Liuyang County, Hunan Province. The county has built twenty-two iron smelting furnaces, which had not produced iron after ten trial runs. On the 8th, after the workers discussed Premier Zhou's statement, the flames of anti-aggression were ignited, and after three days and nights of hard work, ten furnaces have produced iron and have been formally put into production. In the famous revolutionary base area of Pingjiang County, the three agricultural cooperatives of Qiaodong, Qiaoxi, and Qiaoshi have more than 800 mu of third-class late rice seedlings. The original plan was to eliminate them in four days and nights, but after the masses held anti-U.S. aggression demonstrations, they eliminated more than 800 mu of third-class rice seedlings in two days and nights. The people of the old revolutionary base areas in Shaanxi, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and the Northeast and North China, under the slogans of "Produce one more jin of grain, add one more bullet to strike down U.S. imperialism," "Produce one more jin of steel, add one more gun to strike down U.S. imperialism," are fighting day and night in the fields and by the blast furnaces, and they guarantee to have grain as needed and steel as needed.

The people of the old revolutionary base areas on the front lines of coastal defense are even more enthusiastic. While vigilantly guarding the motherland's gate together with the People's Liberation Army soldiers, they are working hard day and night to strengthen the forces supporting the front lines. The farmers in the old revolutionary base areas of western Fujian have been organized in accordance with the requirements of the all-people armed forces. They are standing guard day and night, monitoring the enemy, and strengthening the protection of warehouses, bridges, and other facilities, and are engaging in the production of local iron and grain in a combat posture. More than 500 fighters who are fighting day and night in the construction of furnaces, charcoal burning, and iron smelting have increased the daily output of charcoal from 1,000 jin to 10,000 jin. The people of Houtian Village, where the red flag has not fallen for more than ten years, have overfulfilled the summer grain procurement task by more than 130,000 jin, and are currently actively carrying out field activities such as weeding and fertilizing to ensure a bumper harvest of autumn crops. The members of the Dengta People's Commune in Laiyang County on the Jiaodong Peninsula accused the Kuomintang army armed by the United States of killing 336 of their relatives and friends eleven years ago. Old and new hatred has given them new strength.

The people of the old revolutionary base areas are full of confidence in victory in striking down the U.S. aggressors. They said heroically: We are people who have grown up in hardship, and conquering difficulties is our unique talent. U.S. imperialist guns and cannons cannot scare us. An old Red Army soldier in western Fujian, who is over seventy years old, said with confidence, "We once used homemade guns and spears to capture Longyan City and wiped out the enemy. Today, the people have a powerful army, navy, and air force. If the enemy dares to invade our country, they will surely be completely defeated."

    坚决反对美帝国主义的军事挑衅
    老根据地人民奋力生产
    保证做到要粮有粮要钢有钢
    新华社15日讯　富有革命斗争经验和光荣传统的老根据地人民，正以加紧生产、努力建设老根据地等实际行动，回击美帝国主义对我国的军事挑衅。
    老根据地人民在解放前曾受到国民党反动派和日本帝国主义残酷的进攻和屠杀。有些老根据地人民还受到了美国侵略军的屠杀和摧残。解放后，他们在共产党的领导和关怀下，不但迅速地恢复了创伤，并发展了老根据地的经济，过着和平幸福的生活。当他们听到美帝国主义对我国的军事挑衅的消息后，都极为愤怒，纷纷控诉美国侵略军和国民党反动派的滔天罪行，并决心把仇恨化为力量，拿出当年踊跃参军和支援前线的干劲，支援解放金门、马祖，支援解放台湾。
    江西革命老根据地南城、黎川两县举行了反侵略的示威游行以后，人民愤起昼夜战斗在炼铁炉旁，使生铁产量直线上升。到12日，产量比前一时期多了一倍至二倍。赣县三十三万人民已动员起来，正以冲天干劲消灭三类禾，全部实现一类禾。南康县在游行示威之后，立即组织了十八个生产兵团，由老红军战士和干部带领日夜在田间战斗。
  “多炼钢铁多打粮、坚决打击美国狼”，已成为湖南省浏阳县老根据地人民的行动口号。这个县已建立二十二座炼铁炉，经过十次试炼都未出铁。8日，工人们讨论了周总理的声明后燃起了反侵略的怒火，苦战三昼夜，已有十座炉子出铁，并正式投入生产。著名的革命根据地平江县桥东、桥西、桥市等三个农业社有八百多亩晚稻三类禾苗，原计划四昼夜消灭，群众举行反美侵略示威游行以后，两昼夜就把八百多亩三类禾苗消灭了。陕西、四川、广西、广东和东北、华北等老根据地人民在“多打一斤粮，多增加打击美帝一颗子弹”、“多产一斤钢，多增加打击美帝一枝枪”的口号下，正日夜奋战在田间和高炉旁，他们保证做到要粮有粮，要钢有钢。
    处在海防前哨的老根据地人民更是干劲冲天，他们一面和解放军战士一起警惕地守卫着祖国大门，一面日夜苦战，加强支援前线的力量。福建闽西老根据地的农民已按全民武装的要求组织起来了，他们日夜站岗放哨监视敌人和加强仓库桥梁等的保卫工作，并以战斗姿态投入土铁和粮食生产。日日夜夜战斗在建炉、烧炭、炼铁工地上的战士，有五百多名已将烧炭的日产量由一千斤增加到一万斤。十多年红旗不倒的后田村人民已超额十三万多斤完成了夏季征购任务，目前正积极展开锄草施肥等田间活动，确保秋季作物大丰收。胶东半岛上的莱阳县灯塔人民公社社员，控诉美国武装的国民党军队在十一年前杀害他们的亲友三百三十六人的罪行，旧恨新仇，使他们增加了新的力量。
    老根据地人民对打击美国侵略者充满了胜利信心，他们豪迈地说：我们是在艰难中成长起来的人，征服困难是我们特有的才能。美帝国主义的枪炮是吓不倒我们的。福建闽西老根据地有一位七十多岁的老红军满怀信心地说，我们曾用土枪长矛攻下龙岩城，消灭了敌人，今天人民有了强大的陆海空军，敌人如果敢于向我国侵略，一定会遭到彻底的失败。
