Xinhua News Agency, September 12th - The people of the whole country, enraged by the armed provocations of U.S. imperialism, have launched a surging mass movement of national arming in the past few days, ready to strike at any enemy who dares to invade!

    The people of the provinces at the forefront of the coastal defense struggle were the first to begin the nationwide arming of people who are both workers, farmers, and soldiers. The people of Fujian Province organized a massive militia army of millions, including workers, farmers, merchants, and students. Fuzhou City alone established more than 100 militia regiments. The heroic people of Xiamen are "arming the entire island, everyone practicing martial arts," determined to turn Xiamen Island into an iron fighting fortress. Teachers and students of Xiamen University, who have suffered from the Kuomintang bandits' frenzied shelling, formed a militia division on the spot amid angry roars denouncing the enemy's crimes, and are actively conducting military training. Their slogan is: "Pick up a book and be a student, pick up a gun and be a soldier." Hundreds of thousands of workers, farmers, students, and women in Guangdong Province have requested to participate in militia and reserve training. People from all walks of life in Guangzhou have organized hundreds of militia teams, and every people's commune in the suburbs has established a militia regiment. 280,000 militiamen in the Zhanjiang area are engaged in large-scale military training. In Shantou and Foshan, more than 10,000 young women and more than 21,000 people are participating in training alongside the militia. On the coastal defense line of Zhejiang, the broad masses of the people are closely cooperating with the People's Liberation Army in carrying out "joint military-civilian defense." They hold a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, implementing a great combination of labor and military affairs. These militia heroes, who once fully supported the People's Liberation Army in liberating the coastal islands of eastern Zhejiang, have made a solemn oath: "Mountains can bow their heads, water can flow backwards, we will not give up until we achieve the goal of exceeding grain production, and we are not heroes until we defeat the American robbers!" Many fishing islands in the Zhoushan Islands are also implementing island-wide arming of the people, stepping up military training and patrols, and preparing to fully support the front lines.

    This majestic mass arming movement is also unfolding in the northeastern provinces. Of the 18 million people in Heilongjiang Province, more than 6 million have joined the militia, including more than 90% of the province's young people. Militia are spread throughout both urban and rural areas of Liaoning Province, and in the past few days, the number has expanded from the original 1.3 million to several million. The militia of Anshan, the steel capital, have also been quickly organized. They are vigilantly guarding the steel capital while working even harder to produce more steel and further strengthen the country's national defense capabilities. More than one million militiamen in Jilin Province are comprehensively implementing the "combination of labor and military affairs," determined to complete the three-year military training task in a few months ahead of schedule.

    The militia in the North China provinces, who made immortal contributions in the War of Resistance Against Japan, are carrying forward their glorious traditions, stepping up production and actively practicing martial arts, preparing to respond to the call of the motherland. Hundreds of thousands of militiamen in the famous old revolutionary base areas of Taihang Mountain and Lüliang Mountain have held large-scale demonstrations and parades in recent days to oppose the military provocations of U.S. imperialism and review their strong forces. The people's armed forces in Hebei Province are unprecedentedly strong. Residents, students, and suburban farmers in Tianjin alone have organized more than 300,000 militia divisions and regiments.

    Magnificent war songs resound across the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. In Henan Province, which has already realized communization throughout the province, every commune has established an armed forces department. The commune members are both workers, farmers, and soldiers, achieving "military organization, combat action, and collective life," comprehensively "combining labor and military affairs," and showing their skills. They sing their self-composed songs with pride: "A hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, the fields are the battlefield, the iron shovel opens up ten thousand jin mu, holding a gun and practicing martial arts to defend the country. If the American imperialists dare to invade, we will resolutely wipe them out!" The five million militiamen in Sichuan Province are determined to be a strong backing for the People's Liberation Army. Several million militiamen who have been established in Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Qinghai, and other provinces have universally launched a martial arts movement of "everyone learning to shoot, preparing to fight the enemy," and are further rapidly realizing the arming of the whole people in each province.

    In the capital of the motherland, more than 50 militia divisions with 600,000 to 700,000 people have been organized. Students in institutions of higher education have all implemented military organization.

    和平时期保卫生产　战争时期保卫祖国
    全民皆兵  劳武结合
    据新华社12日讯　被美帝国主义的武装挑衅激怒了的全国人民，在最近短短的几天里，风起云涌地掀起一个全民武装的热潮，随时准备打击胆敢侵犯的敌人！
    站在海防斗争前线的各省人民，首先开始亦工亦农亦兵的全民武装。福建省人民组织起一支包括工农商学的数百万民兵大军，仅福州市就建立了一百多个民兵团。英雄的厦门市人民正在“全岛皆兵，人人练武”，决心把厦门岛变成钢铁的战斗堡垒。遭受蒋贼军疯狂炮击的厦门大学师生，在声讨敌人罪行的怒吼声中，当场组成了民兵师，并积极进行军事训练。他们的口号是：“拿起书本是学生，拿起枪杆是战士”。广东省成千上万的工人、农民、学生和妇女要求参加民兵和预备役训练。广州市各界人民已组织了成百支民兵队，郊区每个人民公社都成立了民兵团。湛江专区的二十八万民兵大练武。汕头、佛山两地同民兵一起参加训练的还有一万多名青壮年妇女和两万一千多名群众。在浙江海防线上，广大人民密切地配合着人民解放军进行“军民联防”。他们一手拿锄，一手持枪，实行劳武大结合。这些曾经以全力支援过人民解放军解放了浙东沿海岛屿的民兵英雄们发出了雄壮的誓言：“山可低头，水可倒流，不实现粮食超产计划不罢休，不打败美国强盗不算英雄！”舟山群岛中的许多渔岛也正在实行全岛全民皆兵，加紧军事训练和巡逻放哨，还准备全力支援前线。
    这一声势豪壮的全民武装运动也同时在东北各省展开。黑龙江省的一千八百万人民，已有六百多万参加了民兵队，包括全省90％以上的青壮年。辽宁省属城乡遍布民兵，几天来已由原来的一百三十万扩大到数百万。钢都鞍山的民兵武装也迅速组织起来，他们一面警惕地保卫着钢都，一面更加干劲冲天地进行生产，保证要生产更多的钢铁，进一步增强祖国的国防力量。吉林省一百多万民兵全面实行“劳武结合”，决心把三年的军事训练任务提前在几个月内完成。
    在抗日战争中立下了不朽功勋的华北各省民兵，发扬光荣传统，加紧生产和积极练武，准备响应祖国召唤。著名的太行山、吕梁山等革命老根据地的百万民兵，连日来分别举行了声势浩大的示威游行，反对美帝国主义的军事挑衅，检阅自己的强大力量。河北省的人民武装空前壮大，仅天津市的居民、学生和郊区农民就组织了三十多万人的民兵师团。
    雄伟的战歌响遍黄河、长江两岸。全省已实现了公社化的河南，每个公社都建立了武装部，社员们亦工亦农亦兵，作到“组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化”，全面“劳武结合”，大显身手。他们豪壮地唱着自编的歌曲：“一把锄头一支枪，田间地头当战场，铁锨开动万斤亩，持枪练武保国防。如果美帝敢侵略，坚决把它消灭光！”四川省的五百万民兵决心作人民解放军的强大后盾。安徽、湖南、湖北、云南、青海等省已建立起来的几百万民兵，普遍掀起“人人学射击，准备打敌人”的练武运动，并且在各省进一步迅速地实现着全民武装。
    在祖国的首都，已组织拥有六七十万人的五十多个民兵师。高等学校学生全部实行了组织军事化。
