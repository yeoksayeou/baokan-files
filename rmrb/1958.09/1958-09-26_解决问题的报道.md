    The report "Writing the History of the Laboring People in Labor" published on page 7 on September 6, and the feature "New Feelings" written by reporter Bai Sheng after visiting students from the History Department of Beijing Normal University who were working in coal mines, are of great educational significance to readers, especially to teaching staff and researchers in historical science. They clearly answer a series of key questions such as what is true historical knowledge, what should today's historical works focus on writing, and for whom should they be written. I hope to read more of this kind of reporting in the newspaper in the future.

    解决问题的报道
    9月6日第七版刊载的“在劳动中写劳动人民的历史”一篇报道，以及记者柏生同志访问北京师范大学历史系下煤矿劳动的学生后写的“新的感情”一篇特写，对读者特别是对历史科学的教学人员和研究工作者的教育意义很大。它们明确地解答了什么才是真正的历史知识，今天的历史著作应该着重写什么，写给谁看等一系列关键性的问题。希望今后在报上能经常读到这一类的报道。
