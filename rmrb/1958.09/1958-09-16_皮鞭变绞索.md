    Wielding a gold dollar whip,
    Clutching the whip tight in hand.
    The gold dollar wants to "fish,"
    The whip wants to scare the man.
    The people's strength is as great as mountains,
    The people's eyes are as bright as fire.
    Scaring won't scare them,
    Deceiving won't deceive them.
    The whip dances wildly,
    As if possessed by a demon,
    Falling on its own neck,
    The whip suddenly turns into a noose.
    The more you pull, the tighter the rope,
    The more you wrap, the more circles there are.
    This is truly—
    Hoisted by your own petard,
    Trying to be clever, but becoming clumsy!

    皮鞭变绞索
    禾君
    金元鞭头系，
    皮鞭手中握。
    金元要把“鱼”钓，
    皮鞭要把人吓。
    人民力量大如山，
    人民眼睛明似火。
    吓也吓不倒，
    骗也骗不着。
    皮鞭满天舞，
    好像着了魔，
    落到自己脖子上，
    皮鞭忽然变绞索。
    越拉索越紧，
    越缠圈越多。
    这才是——
    自作自己受，
    弄巧反成拙！
