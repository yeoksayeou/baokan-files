    Cotton Covered with a Cotton Quilt
  　Ye Qianyu (Poem and Painting)
 Deep plowing and heavy fertilization ensure high yields,
 And blankets are spread to ward off the cold;
 Growing day and night without rest,
 It is gloriously called the "Cotton King" of Xushui.

    棉花盖棉被
  　叶浅予  诗并画深耕厚肥保丰产，复被张灯却风寒；日夜滋长无休时，艳称徐水棉花王。
