Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd, Geneva dispatch: The Second International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy opened in Geneva on September 1st.

About five thousand scientists from various countries are participating in this conference. Among them, two thousand are official representatives from more than sixty countries and some international organizations. The conference will hear and discuss approximately six hundred and fifty scientific reports. Issues related to the study of thermonuclear reactions will be one of the central topics of the conference. In addition, issues related to the further development of the use of isotopes in science and technology will be studied.

The Soviet delegation will submit more than two hundred and twenty reports to the conference, more than double the number submitted at the first conference in 1955. About half of the reports will be presented by Soviet scientists themselves in plenary sessions and panel discussions.

Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd, Moscow dispatch: Nikita Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, sent a congratulatory letter to the participants of the Second International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, which opened in Geneva on September 1st. The letter pointed out that the convening of this conference has created broad possibilities for countries to cooperate in atomic science and technology and to exchange the latest knowledge and experience.

Khrushchev said in the letter that if an agreement banning atomic weapons could be concluded and such weapons could be eliminated from the arsenals of all countries, then this cooperation would have unparalleled benefits. At that time, all atomic energy could be used to serve peace and progress.

Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd, Geneva dispatch: The Soviet Union has built various types of large-scale thermonuclear devices and an atomic power plant that can regenerate its own fuel. The construction of a mobile atomic power plant with a capacity of 2,000 kilowatts is nearing completion. The prospect of manufacturing atomic steam turbine power units has also emerged. Large atomic power plants are being built in the Urals, Leningrad Oblast, and Voronezh Oblast (Russian Federation). In addition, a huge atomic dynamics science and technology experimental center is being established in Ulyanovsk Oblast in the Volga region.

This magnificent picture of the vigorous development of the atomic industry was announced by Professor Yemelyanov, head of the Soviet delegation to the Second International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, in his report at the conference on September 1st. The Director of the Soviet Union's Main Administration for the Utilization of Atomic Energy first spoke about the issue of controllable thermonuclear reactions, saying, "We believe that after the widespread use of heavy nuclear fission energy, the era of more widespread use of light nuclear fusion energy is about to arrive."

He said that it is very clear that the first industrial reactors built will use a mixture of deuterium and tritium, followed by reactors using pure deuterium (deuterium is pronounced as dāo, and tritium is pronounced as chuān, both are isotopes of hydrogen, and the reserves of deuterium in nature are extremely large, enough for hundreds of millions of years even with the most developed power industry). Deuterium-tritium reactors may be extremely lightweight and suitable for installation on ships.

The latest engineering calculations show that it is realistic to emit millions of kilowatts of energy from every cubic meter of hot plasma gas of deuterium and tritium in the reactor. This is more energy than any other power unit (including atomic reactors and jet engines) can generate.

Yemelyanov then talked about various types of atomic power plants. He said that the Soviet Union has built an atomic power plant that can regenerate its own fuel. The nuclear materials that become waste after being used in ordinary atomic power plants can be fully used here to produce power.

He pointed out that the Soviet Union is also building a mobile atomic power plant with a capacity of 2,000 kilowatts, and its reactor is installed in a shell with a diameter of about one meter and a height of two point two meters. This mobile power plant will be installed and put into trial operation in the first atomic power plant by the end of this year.

He also pointed out that calculations show that mobile reactors with beryllium oxide or graphite active zones and low-cost ceramic exothermic components can be manufactured. The heat transfer agent uses nitrogen and helium heated to 800 degrees Celsius.

Yemelyanov said that an experimental fast neutron reactor with a capacity of 5,000 kilowatts has been operating in the Soviet Union for a month (the capacity of the world's first atomic power plant was also this large). Its main parameters are close to industrial requirements. Using the experience of operating this fast neutron reactor, the finalized designs of the same type of reactors for the two industrial power plants currently being designed can be made. One of them is a power plant with a capacity of 50,000 kilowatts, which will be built on the Volga River. Later, a power plant of the same type with a capacity of 250,000 kilowatts will be designed.

The professor said that most of the atomic power plants built and designed by the Soviet Union are equipped with reactors that use ordinary water as a moderator and heat transfer agent. In the future, we will also switch to reactors that directly introduce steam into the steam turbine. This will save intermediate steam generators and a large amount of auxiliary equipment. The 400,000-kilowatt power plant being built in the Urals is such a type.

Yemelyanov finally talked about the huge center for atomic power science and technology experiments being established in the Volga region. He said that various types of reactors built there will be tested under industrial utilization conditions. A boiling water reactor with a capacity of 50,000 kilowatts and a reactor using liquid sodium as a heat transfer agent will first be put into operation here. In addition, there is a homogeneous power reactor that uses heavy water dissolved with uranium. It will be able to avoid the use of expensive heating elements. The designed power of this reactor is 35,000 kilowatts. After the report, Yemelyanov also distributed four previously unpublished reports to the participants, elaborating on the research results of controllable thermonuclear reaction issues.

Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd, Geneva dispatch: The exhibition of member countries of the Second International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy opened in Geneva on August 31st. The Soviet exhibits have attracted great attention from many representatives attending the conference.

The Soviet Union is currently conducting large-scale thermonuclear research, and exhibits related to this research have particularly attracted attention. People were particularly interested in visiting a gas discharge device of the same size as the real object. In 1952, Soviet scientists used this device to obtain neutrons due to gas discharge. In addition to some thermonuclear devices, the Soviet exhibition also displayed models of some huge atomic power plants currently being built by the Soviet Union, a model of the world's first atomic icebreaker "Lenin," and some unique physics equipment.

This exhibition showcases the achievements of approximately twenty countries in the application of atomic energy in scientific research, industry, agriculture, medicine, and other departments. The exhibition is located in the exhibition hall specially built in the garden of the League of Nations Building in Geneva. The total area of the exhibition is 7,000 square meters, while the area of the similar exhibition held during the first International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955 was only 1,600 square meters.

The exhibits of the United States include a model of the reactor of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station, which they built only in 1957. The exhibits of the United Kingdom include the "ZETA" thermonuclear device. The exhibits of France, Czechoslovakia, Canada, India, Hungary, Switzerland, and other countries have also attracted attention.

This exhibition will last for half a month and will close on September 15th.

　　苏联和平利用原子能走在最前面
    将在和平利用原子能国际会议上提出大量科学报告
　　苏联已建成各种大型热核装置，建成一座能再生出本身所需燃料的原子能发电站，将建成一座流动原子能发电站……
    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：第二届和平利用原子能国际会议9月1日在日内瓦开幕。
    这次会议有来自各个国家约五千名科学家参加。其中有两千名是来自六十多个国家和一些国际组织的正式代表。会议将听取和讨论约六百五十个科学报告。同研究热核反应有关的问题将是会议的中心议题之一。此外，还要研究同进一步发展在科学和技术上使用同位素有关的问题。
    苏联代表团将向会议提出二百二十多个报告，比1955年第一届会议上提出的报告还多一倍。报告中约有一半将由苏联科学家亲自在全体会议和小组会议上宣读。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科1日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫向9月1日在日内瓦召开的联合国和平利用原子能第二届国际会议的参加者发出贺信，信中指出，这个会议的召开为各国在原子科学和技术方面进行合作以及交换最新的知识和经验创造了广泛的可能。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中说，如果能缔结禁止原子武器的协定，能把这种武器从各国军备中取消，那么这种合作就会有无比的好处。那时候，全部原子能就可以用来为和平和进步服务。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：苏联已经建成各种型式的大型热核装置，建成了一座能再生出本身所需燃料的原子能发电站。功率二千瓩的流动原子能发电站的建造即将完成。制造原子汽轮电力装置的前景也已经出现。在乌拉尔、列宁格勒州和沃罗涅日州（俄罗斯联邦）正在建造一些大型的原子能发电站。此外，在伏尔加地区乌里扬诺夫斯克州，一个巨大的原子动力学科学和技术试验中心正在建立起来。
    这幅蓬勃发展的原子工业建设的宏伟图景是出席第二届和平利用原子能国际会议的苏联代表团团长叶麦利扬诺夫教授9月1日在这个会议上作报告时宣布的。这位苏联利用原子能总管理局局长首先谈到可控制的热核反应的问题，他说：“我们认为，在广泛利用重核裂变能之后，更广泛地利用轻核聚变能的时代即将到来。”
    他说，十分明显，首先建成的将是使用氘和氚的混合物的工业反应堆，而后是使用纯氘的反应堆（氘读作刀，氚读作川，都是氢的同位素，自然界的氘储量极多，在动力工业最发达情况下也够用几亿年）。氘—氚反应堆可能是极其轻便的，适于装置在船只上。
    最新工程计算表明，从反应堆每一立方公尺的氘和氚的灼热等离子气体中发出几百万瓩的能量是现实的。这比任何其他动力装置（包括原子反应堆、喷气发动机）所发的能量都要多。
    叶麦利扬诺夫接着谈到各种类型的原子发电站。他说，苏联建成了一种可以再生出本身所需燃料的原子能发电站。在普通原子能发电站中用过后变成废料的核原料在这里可以全部用来生产动力。
    他指出，苏联还在建造功率为二千瓩的流动原子能发电站，它的反应堆装在一个直径约一公尺和高二点二公尺的外壳内。这个流动发电站今年年底将在第一个原子能发电站内安装完毕并且开始试运转。
    他还指出，计算表明，可以制成带有氧化铍或石墨活性区和成本低廉的陶制放热元件的流动反应堆。其中的导热剂采用加热到摄氏八百度的氮和氦。
    叶麦利扬诺夫说，一个功率为五千瓩的快中子试验性反应堆已经在一个月以前开始在苏联运转（世界上第一个原子能发电站的功率也是这么大）。它的主要参数接近工业要求。利用这个快中子反应堆运转的经验，就可以作出目前正在设计的两个工业用发电站的同型反应堆的定型设计。其中有一个功率达五万瓩的发电站将建于伏尔加河上。以后还要设计功率为二十五万瓩的同型发电站。
    这位教授说，苏联所建造和设计的原子能发电站，大多数装备的都是用普通水作为减速剂和导热剂的反应堆。今后我们还将转而采用把蒸汽直接通到汽轮机的反应堆。这样就可省去中间的蒸汽发生器和大量的辅助设备。兴建于乌拉尔的四十万瓩发电站就是这样的一种。
    叶麦利扬诺夫最后谈到伏尔加地区正在建立的原子动力科学技术试验的巨大中心。他说，在那里建设的各种类型的反应堆，将在工业利用的条件下进行试验。功率达五万瓩的沸水型反应堆，以及采用液态钠作导热剂的反应堆将首先在这里运转。此外，还有一种均匀型的动力反应堆，是利用溶有铀的重水的。它将可以不采用昂贵的发热元件。这个反应堆的设计功率为三万五千瓩。叶麦利扬诺夫在报告以后还向与会者散发了四篇从未发表过的、阐述可控制热核反应问题研究成果的报告。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：第二届和平利用原子能国际会议成员国展览会8月31日在日内瓦开幕。苏联的展品引起了参加会议的许多代表们的极大的注意。
    苏联目前正在大规模进行热核研究，关于这部分研究的展品特别引起了注意。人们特别感兴趣地参观一部与实物一样大小的气体放电装置，1952年苏联科学家就是利用这部装置由于气体放电获得了中子。除了一些热核装置外，苏联展览台上还展出了苏联目前正在建造的一些巨大的原子能发电站的模型、世界上第一艘原子能破冰船“列宁号”的模型和一些独一无二的物理学设备。
    这次展览会共展出了约二十个国家在科学研究、工业、农业、医学和其它部门运用原子能方面的成就。展览会设在日内瓦国联大厦花园内专门建造的展览馆中。展览会总面积达七千平方公尺，而1955年第一届和平利用原子能国际会议期间举行的同类展览会面积仅一千六百平方公尺。
    美国的展品中包括他们在1957年才建成的希平港原子能发电站的反应堆的模型。英国的展品中包括“泽塔”热核装置。法国、捷克斯洛伐克、加拿大、印度、匈牙利、瑞士等国的展品也受到了注意。
    这届展览会将举行半月，在9月15日闭幕。
