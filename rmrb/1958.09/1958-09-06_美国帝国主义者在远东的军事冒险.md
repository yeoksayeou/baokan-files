　　US Imperialists' Military Adventures in the Far East
    Soviet "Pravda" Commentator
    The efforts of American monopoly organizations to impose their rule on other countries are reflected in the "position of strength" policy, and their attempt to keep the world in a state of permanent tension is embodied in the adventurous policy of maintaining "brinkmanship." While posing as protectors of the "free," i.e., capitalist world, the US ruling circles unscrupulously and rudely interfere in the affairs of other countries.
    Just recently, American imperialists brutally armed and invaded Lebanese territory, hindering the Arab people from liberating themselves from the heavy oppression of foreign monopoly organizations. Washington did not get its way in this intervention. The Arab people did not kneel before the tanks and planes of the invaders. On the contrary, they united closely against the imperialists' interference in their affairs. The people of all countries, especially those of the socialist camp, supported the Arab people. International public opinion was indignant at the treacherous attack by the aggressors, and under the pressure of this opinion, the special session of the UN General Assembly actually condemned the Anglo-American aggression against the Middle East and demanded the withdrawal of the intervention forces.
    The failure of the Middle East adventure did not restrain the ferocity of the advocates of the "brinkmanship" policy. Acting according to the will of the military-industrial monopoly organizations keen on maintaining international tension, American diplomats and warmongers immediately took steps in the Far East, which marked the beginning of a new and more dangerous military adventure. The Chiang Kai-shek elements entrenched on the coastal islands of China, at the behest of their American masters, re-launched provocative attacks on the territory of the People's China.
    The events in the Taiwan Strait area in recent days show that these attacks are only part of a large-scale military provocation conspiracy by the American imperialists against the People's Republic of China and the people of all Asian countries. The first cannons along the Chinese coast had not yet subsided when the US government mobilized a large number of armed forces. It mobilized the Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait area. This fleet has been rapidly strengthened. The US Air Force in the Far East has also been increased. The Marines have landed on Taiwan, which is currently occupied by Chiang Kai-shek elements. According to "Newsweek," the United States conducted "the largest concentration of American naval forces in the Far East since World War II."
    US Army Secretary Brucker, US Pacific Army Commander White, US Taiwan Defense Commander Smoot, and US Ambassador Drumwright recently held long talks with Chiang Kai-shek and his generals. According to newspaper reports, later confirmed by Brucker himself, the allies of the military adventure agreed on some plans and reached an agreement on further actions.
    At the same time, extensive war propaganda preparations began. American ministers, congressmen, and commentators blatantly advocated that widespread military action was possible and inevitable. Some newspapers, especially the "New York Herald Tribune," which is close to the US government, demanded a "major war" against the People's Republic of China. US government officials and commentators believe that the reason for conducting this war is that the People's Republic of China intends to recover the islands that have been Chinese territory since ancient times but have been occupied by the American imperialists and their servant, the Chiang Kai-shek elements. In order to deceive the American people and drag them into the war, American diplomats and generals have been shouting that Taiwan Island, and even the small islands along the Chinese coast, are of great significance to the defense and security of the United States itself.
    Saying that the return of these Chinese islands to their legitimate owners, the Chinese people, is a threat to American security is nonsense, the purpose of which is to deceive the American public and America's allies. In fact, as some American newspapers inadvertently revealed, the coastal islands were occupied by Chiang Kai-shek elements under the direct orders of the US command. "New York Herald Tribune" commentator Alsop said, "American politicians... began to exert the strongest pressure on the Generalissimo (referring to Chiang Kai-shek -- TASS editor's note) to occupy the coastal islands with great force."
    The "Christian Science Monitor" also said that the coastal islands were consolidated and strengthened with troops "under the actual encouragement of Washington."
    In the American aggression plan, the role of these islands is as a springboard for attacking the People's Republic of China, and Taiwan is the main base for this aggression. It is quite obvious that the People's Republic of China cannot allow these islands to remain in the hands of enemies taking open military action. China's intention to liberate these islands from the hands of foreign aggressors and their servants is legitimate and just. All peace-loving people watch with concern and sympathy the efforts of the Chinese people and hope that they will win victory in the sacred struggle to unify their motherland.
    American military adventurers have adopted shameless provocative blackmail, threatening China with atomic bombs. United Press International reporters, in reporting Dulles's talks with the leaders of the US armed forces, deliberately emphasized that "effective US assistance in maintaining Jinmen or Matsu requires the use of small atomic bombs against those mainland Chinese strongholds that serve as bases for invading forces." For the same blackmail purpose, the military command announced that US aircraft carrier planes "may carry out powerful strikes with conventional and atomic weapons."
    According to the "Washington Post and Times Herald," Dulles intends to formally issue a "warning" that the US government "does not rule out the possibility of the US armed forces using atomic weapons in the Far East."
    In addition to the successive concentration of armed forces in the Taiwan area and the widespread propaganda, the United States has also launched a diplomatic offensive to force its allies in the aggressive bloc to support its military adventure in the Far East. Dulles summoned representatives of the member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization aggressive bloc. According to newspaper reports, the United States requested support from the Philippines, Japan, the United Kingdom, and certain other countries. Philippine President Garcia said that in the US war against China, the Philippines would not support the United States.
    The Japanese government has been under great pressure, and the Japanese people have strongly protested against the US adventurous policy in the Far East. The Japanese progressive forces resolutely condemned the current Japanese government's attempt to participate in the US military provocations against the People's Republic of China and demanded the immediate withdrawal of all US armed forces from the Taiwan area. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan condemned the US military adventure and, on behalf of three million members, demanded that "the United States immediately stop concentrating its armed forces in the Taiwan area."
    Although the British government continues to remain silent on the US war preparations in the Far East, British newspapers have almost unanimously condemned the new American adventure. The famous writer and historian Taylor published an article in the "Sunday Express," arguing that the US action is "a crime against humanity." He wrote that humanity "is now on the brink of a major war..."
    The Dutch "Telegraaf" believes that it is necessary to warn: "If the United States goes to war with the People's Republic of China over Taiwan, it will be isolated from its allies."
    Canadian Foreign Minister Smith said in Parliament that Canada had notified the United States that "if difficulties arise in the Formosa (Taiwan) area, Canada will not intervene."
    The US war preparations have also caused great unease in India. The "Searchlight" wrote, "Dulles's brinkmanship policy is now shifting from West Asia (from the Middle East -- TASS editor's note) to the Far East." The "Tribune" accused the US government of not drawing any conclusions from the bankruptcy of the US adventure in the Middle East. "Free Press" pointed out: "If the Americans intervene in the struggle for these islands, then this would be a direct intervention, which would lead to a major war."
    The adventurous policy of the US ruling circles has also caused a certain degree of dissatisfaction in the United States. Broad sections of the population are increasingly protesting the danger of a new war. Newspapers across the country are constantly receiving letters from ordinary people, calling for an end to America's slide towards war. The "New York Post" reflected this sentiment, recently publishing an editorial saying: "The coastal islands only have strategic significance as bases for the Kuomintang to carry out unimaginable attacks on the Chinese mainland and as symbols for conducting ineffective psychological warfare. We believe that the deliberate adventure carried out by the United States is an excessive adventure based on muddled intentions..." This newspaper emphasized that "the deadly danger of a Far East war is more unsettling to Americans than the difficulty of acknowledging that Beijing has a voice in resolving Far East issues."
    The worldwide outrage at the new American adventure shows that America's isolation has deepened further since the Anglo-American intervention in the Middle East. However, the American warlords are still frantically preparing for war against the People's Republic of China. America's lackeys boast of their strength and wave atomic weapons, apparently less to intimidate the Chinese people and their many friends than to cheer up their own wavering allies.
    The peace-loving countries that closely watch the conspiracies of American war instigators understand that the US ruling circles are planning a military adventure in the Far East not because they are strong. They are troubled and recklessly taking risks because they see and feel that the strength of the people who consistently fight for peace and for easing international tension is constantly growing. The desire to resolve international disputes through peaceful means is so widespread that the US ruling circles are not only often isolated abroad but also often isolated at home. In order to impose their will and policies on the American people and America's allies, the ruling circles in Washington are increasingly resorting to military adventures, deliberately pushing humanity to the brink of war disaster.
    The new military adventure planned by the American imperialists in the Far East contains a direct and serious danger to world peace. But let the adventurers not be intoxicated by the illusion that they can "try their strength" and get away with a light military trip! Let the bosses of American monopoly organizations not expect that a new war will still allow them to make a fortune as in the past wars.
    The People's Republic of China has enough strength to give the aggressors the punishment they deserve. On the side of the Chinese people is not only the sympathy of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, but also the power of the entire socialist camp. The Soviet Union cannot be indifferent to what happens on the borders or in the territory of its great ally. The Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to the US war preparations in the Pacific, because the waters of the Pacific also lap the shores of the Soviet Union. The Soviet people, who have fraternal friendship and mutual assistance relations with the People's Republic of China, will use all means to assist their brothers, the Chinese people, to restrain the shameless and reckless adventurers, the war instigators.
    Those who incite and plan new military adventures in the Far East should not imagine that the counterattack will be limited to the coastal islands area and the Taiwan Strait. They will suffer such a devastating blow, which will surely end the US imperialist aggression in the Far East. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　美国帝国主义者在远东的军事冒险
    苏联“真理报”评论员
    美国垄断组织卖尽气力要把自己的统治强加给其他国家的做法在“实力地位”政策中得到了反映，而它们打算使世界永远保持紧张状态的企图体现在维持“战争边缘”的冒险政策中。美国统治集团一方面自封为“自由的”、即资本主义的世界的保护者，同时却肆无忌惮地、粗暴地干涉其他国家事务。
    就在不久之前，美国帝国主义者粗暴地武装侵入了黎巴嫩领土，阻挠阿拉伯人民从外国垄断组织沉重的压迫下获得解放。在这次干涉中华盛顿没有如愿以偿。阿拉伯人民没有在侵略者的坦克和飞机面前屈膝。相反地，他们紧密地团结了起来，反对帝国主义者干涉他们的事务。世界各国人民、特别是社会主义阵营各国人民都支持阿拉伯人民。国际舆论对侵略者背信弃义的进攻感到愤慨，在这个舆论的压力下，联合国大会特别会议实际上谴责了美英两国对中近东的侵略，并且要求撤退干涉军。
    中近东冒险的失败并没有使“战争边缘”政策的鼓吹者收敛凶焰。按照热中于保持国际紧张局势的军事工业垄断组织的意志行事的美国外交人士和战争狂人立即在远东采取了步骤，这些步骤意味着一次新的、更加危险的军事冒险的开端。盘踞中国沿海岛屿的蒋介石分子奉美国主子之命重新向人民中国的领土发动了挑衅性的进攻。
    最近几天台湾海峡地区发生的事件表明，这些进攻只不过是美国帝国主义者对中华人民共和国以及整个亚洲各国人民发动大规模军事挑衅阴谋的一部分。中国沿海第一批炮声还没有沉寂下来，美国政府就开动了大批的武装部队。它动员第七舰队到台湾海峡地区。这支舰队迅速地加强了。美国在远东的空军也增加了。海军陆战队已在蒋介石分子目前盘踞的台湾登陆。据“新闻周刊”指出，美国进行了“第二次世界大战以来远东美国海军规模最大的一次集结”。
    美国陆军部长布鲁克、美国太平洋陆军司令怀特、美国台湾防卫司令斯摩特和美国大使德鲁姆赖特最近还同蒋介石和他的将领们举行了长时间的会谈。据后来经布鲁克本人证实的报纸消息说，军事冒险的同盟者商定了一些计划，并就进一步的行动达成了协议。
    同时开始了广泛的战争宣传准备。美国的部长、国会议员和评论员明目张胆地鼓吹，广泛的军事行动是可能和不可避免的。某些报纸，特别是接近美国政府的“纽约先驱论坛报”要求对中华人民共和国发动“大战”。美国政府人士和评论员认为，进行这种战争的理由是中华人民共和国打算收回自古以来就是中国的、但被美国帝国主义者及其仆从蒋介石分子所侵占的岛屿。为了欺骗美国人民和把美国人民拖入战争，美国的外交人士和将军们大喊大叫地说，台湾岛，甚至中国沿海的小岛对美国本身的国防和安全具有很大意义。
    说什么这些中国岛屿回到它们的合法主人——中国人民的手中就是威胁美国安全，这是一派胡言，其目的是要欺骗美国公众和美国的盟国。事实上，正如某些美国报纸无意中吐露的，沿海岛屿是蒋介石分子在美国司令部直接命令下占据的，“纽约先驱论坛报”评论员艾尔索普说，“美国的政治家……开始对大元帅（指蒋介石——塔斯社编者注）施加最强硬的压力，要他用巨大的力量占据沿海岛屿”。
    “基督教科学箴言报”也说，沿海岛屿是“在华盛顿的实际鼓励下”用军队巩固和加强的。
    在美国的侵略计划中这些岛屿的作用是进攻中华人民共和国的跳板，而台湾是这个侵略的主要基地。十分明显，中华人民共和国不能够容许这些岛屿留在采取公开军事行动的敌人的手中。中国要把这些岛屿从外国侵略者及其仆从的手中解放出来的意图是合法的和正义的。一切爱好和平的人民关切而同情地注视着中国人民的努力，并且希望他们在争取统一祖国的神圣斗争中获得胜利。
    美国军事冒险家采取了无耻的挑衅讹诈，用原子弹威胁中国。合众国际社记者在报道杜勒斯同美国武装部队领导人的会谈时，故意强调说，“美国对保持金门或马祖的有效援助要求对那些作为侵入力量活动基地的大陆中国据点采用不大的原子弹”。为了同样的讹诈目的，军事司令部宣布，美国航空母舰的飞机“可能用普通武器和原子武器进行有力的打击”。
    据“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”报道，杜勒斯打算正式提出“警告”说，美国政府“不排除美国在远东的武装部队使用原子武器的可能性”。
    除了武装部队在台湾地区陆续集结和进行广泛宣传外，美国还发动了外交攻势，以迫使它的侵略集团的同盟国支持它在远东的军事冒险。杜勒斯曾经召见东南亚条约组织侵略集团各参加国的代表。据报纸指出，美国要求菲律宾、日本、英国和某些其他国家给予支援。菲律宾总统加西亚说，在美国对中国的战争中，菲律宾将不支持美国。
    日本政府受到了很大的压力，日本人民强烈抗议美国在远东的冒险政策。日本进步力量坚决谴责现任日本政府想参加美国对中华人民共和国的军事挑衅的图谋，并且要求所有美国武装部队立即撤出台湾地区。日本工会总评议会谴责了美国的军事冒险，并且代表三百万会员要求“美国立即停止在台湾地区集结自己的武装部队”。
    虽然英国政府对美国在远东的战争准备继续保持沉默，但是英国报纸却几乎一致指责美国的新冒险。著名的作家和历史学家泰勒在“星期日快报”发表文章，认为美国的行动是“对人类的犯罪行为”。他写道，人类“现在濒于大战的边缘……”
    荷兰“电讯报”认为必须警告：“如果美国因为台湾而同中华人民共和国打起仗来，就会孤立于盟国之外。”
    加拿大外交部长史密斯在议会说，加拿大已经通知美国，“如果在福摩萨（台湾）地区发生困难的话，加拿大将不干预。”
    美国的备战活动也在印度引起了巨大的不安。“探照灯报”写道，“杜勒斯的战争边缘政策现在从西亚（从中近东——塔斯社编者注）转移到远东。”“论坛报”指责美国政府没有从美国在中东的冒险行动的破产中得出任何结论。“自由新闻”指出：“如果美国人插手于争夺这些岛屿的斗争中去，那么这将是一种直接干涉，它会导致大战。”
    美国统治集团的冒险政策也在美国国内引起了一定的不满。广大居民阶层越来越多地抗议新战争的危险。各地报纸不断接到老百姓的来函，要求制止美国滚向战争。“纽约邮报”反映了这种情绪，它最近发表社论说：“沿海岛屿只是在作为国民党向中国大陆实行不可想像的进攻的基地和作为进行毫无成效的神经战的标志时，才具有战略意义。我们认为，美国所进行的蓄意的冒险是以糊涂的打算为基础的、过份的冒险……”这家报纸着重指出，“同难以承认北京在解决远东问题上有发言权这件事比较起来，远东战争的致命危险更使美国人感到不安。”
    全世界对美国的新的冒险行动日益愤慨，这件事表明，从美英干涉中近东以来，美国的孤立程度进一步加深了。可是，美国的军阀仍然狂热地准备着对中华人民共和国的战争。美国的猢狲们吹嘘他们的实力，挥舞原子武器，显然，与其说他们是想借此恐吓中国人民和中国人民的许多朋友，倒不如说是为了给他们自己的那些动摇的盟国打气。
    密切注视美国战争挑拨者的阴谋的爱好和平的国家明白，美国统治集团在远东策划军事冒险并不是因为它们强大。它们烦恼不安、鲁莽地去冒险，是因为它们看到和感到：一贯为和平、为缓和国际紧张局势而斗争的人们的力量在不断增长。希望通过和平方式解决国际争端问题的愿望极为普遍，以致使美国统治集团不仅常常在国外陷于孤立，而且在国内也常常陷于孤立。为了把自己的意志和政策强加给美国人民和美国的盟国，华盛顿的统治集团日益经常地使用军事冒险手段，蓄意把人类推向战争灾难的边缘。
    美国帝国主义者在远东策划的新的军事冒险包含着对世界和平的直接的、严重的危险。但是，冒险之徒别陶醉于他们可以“试一试力量”和作一次轻松的军事旅行就能了事这种幻想吧！美国垄断组织的老板们别指望新战争还能像在过去的战争中一样使他们大发横财吧。
    中华人民共和国拥有足够的力量给侵略者以应有的打击。在中国人民这一边的，不仅有亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和欧洲各国人民的同情，而且还有整个社会主义阵营的威力。苏联对于在它的伟大盟国的边境上或领土上所发生的事情，不能漠不关心。苏联对于美国在太平洋的备战活动不能漠然视之，因为太平洋的海水也拍击着苏联的海岸。同中华人民共和国有着兄弟友谊和互相援助关系的苏联人民，将用一切方法援助自己的兄弟——中国人民，来约束厚颜无耻的、轻举妄动的冒险之徒——战争挑拨者。
    在远东煽动和策划新军事冒险的人休想回击只会限于沿海岛屿地区和台湾海峡。他们将遭到这样毁灭性的打击，这种打击必将结束美国在远东的帝国主义侵略。　（新华社）
