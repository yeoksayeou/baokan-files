America's Bandit Logic
——A Critique of the U.S. State Department Memorandum on Non-Recognition of China
Hu Jin
The U.S. State Department's released memorandum stubbornly denies that its policy of hostility toward China is unrealistic. The memorandum brazenly clamors: "The United States believes that the rule of communism in China is not permanent, and it will eventually disappear one day." And America's practice of not recognizing China is to "accelerate this process of disappearance." This is a repetition of Dulles' speech "Our Policy Toward Chinese Communism" delivered last June. At that time, Dulles said that the U.S.'s hostile policy toward China was "based" on the assessment that the new China "is a transient rather than a permanent phenomenon." He shamelessly declared: "If we believe that establishing diplomatic relations with the current (Chinese) regime would promote this disappearance, then we would establish such relations."

Look! This is how the United States is hostile to the Chinese people: not recognizing our country is, of course, to "accelerate" our country's "disappearance"; recognizing it is also to "promote" our country's "disappearance." Whether to recognize you or not is all for the purpose of eliminating you. This is the logic of America's bandit diplomacy. What arrogant ambitions this is towards the new China! What a complete exposure of the hideous face of U.S. imperialism!

America's bandit-like diplomatic logic is a blatant trampling on the standards of international law and the American Declaration of Independence, as well as the American diplomatic principles proposed by Jefferson. The memorandum's attempt to use Jefferson's words to justify America's aggressive policy of hostility toward China is an insult to Jefferson. The basic principles of modern international law recognize that every sovereign state enjoys recognized basic rights and bears recognized basic obligations, such as the right to territorial integrity and sovereignty being respected, and the corresponding obligation not to violate the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries, the right to conduct international exchanges, participate in various international organizations, and corresponding obligations, etc.; these rights and obligations are inherent to any country and do not depend on diplomatic recognition. The American Declaration of Independence of 1776 also recognizes that people have the right to change or abolish a government and establish a new government, setting the new government on principles that best guarantee the safety and happiness of the people, and organizing its power in a form that conforms to these principles. Jefferson, who served as Secretary of State under President Washington in 1793 (and was elected as the third president in 1800), proposed that the principle of American foreign policy should be: "Let any country obtain the right by which our own government was established, to govern itself according to the form it pleases, and to change these forms according to its own will." May I ask, how can this be compatible with the U.S.'s occupation of our territory Taiwan, interference in our internal affairs, and deprivation of our legitimate seat in the United Nations? What do these have in common with the American Declaration of Independence and the principles proposed by Jefferson? An article written by Quincy Wright, Professor Emeritus of International Law at the University of Chicago, published in the March issue of "Modern History Materials" this year, believes that "the U.S.'s continued non-recognition of China's Communist government violates the normal expectations of international law and the traditional American foreign policy begun by Washington when he recognized the revolutionary government of France in 1793."

America's actions in violation of international law standards are written all over its history of bloody aggression for more than a hundred years. America's betrayal of the traditional policies of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln is the result of America's rapid development into imperialism and the center of reactionary forces worldwide after its independence. This is not surprising at all. The problem is that the decadent, declining, and extremely reactionary era of imperialism is giving way to the era of socialism and the era of national liberation. Under this new era, the U.S. imperialist's logic of bandit diplomacy is fundamentally unworkable for all people who dare to uphold independence and freedom and resolutely struggle against imperialism. Regardless of whether it recognizes them or not, regardless of what despicable means it uses, including military aggression, it cannot "eliminate" one socialist country after another, one nationally independent country after another that is rising up. The United States did not recognize the Soviet Union for sixteen years and even participated in the shameful armed intervention of fourteen imperialist powers. After recognizing the Soviet Union, it surrounded it and threatened it until Hitler's Germany attacked the Soviet Union, when it still wanted to wait for the day when both sides were "injured" and the United States would clean up the mess in the end. But what was the result? After the war, a large number of socialist countries rose up in Eastern Europe. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also emerged. Regardless of whether the United States recognized these countries or not, it openly opposed them under the black flag of "liberation" and launched the war of aggression against Korea, intervened in the war in Indochina, and instigated the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary. But what was the result? Dulles cursed the neutral policies of the nationally independent countries that the United States had already recognized, brutally interfered in the internal affairs of these countries, openly supported the rebel groups in Indonesia, and under the black flag of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," planned military aggression against Syria, which the United States had already recognized. This time, it more viciously sent troops to invade the Middle East. What was the result?

The bankruptcy of the U.S.'s policy of hostility toward the Chinese people is also an obvious fact. Let's not talk about the bloody history of U.S. aggression against China after the Opium War. Just from the Chinese People's Liberation War to the short period of nine years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have broken through the layers of interference, aggression, and hostility of U.S. imperialism and achieved their own victory as a new force in the development of human history. The "China White Paper" published by the U.S. State Department in August 1949 and the recent memorandum published by the U.S. State Department are a series of confessions of the U.S.'s failed policy of hostility toward China. The U.S. White Paper had to admit that the revolutionary storm of the Chinese people irresistibly shattered U.S. interference and aggression: "The unfortunate outcome of the Chinese Civil War was beyond the control of the U.S. government. What the United States has done or could have done within the reasonable limits of its capabilities could not have changed this result. What the United States did not do had no impact on this result. This is the product of internal forces in China, which the United States has also tried to influence, but without effect." In the past nine years, the U.S. imperialism, unwilling to admit defeat, has not only occupied our Taiwan, supported the Chiang Kai-shek clique, imposed an "embargo" on our country, and deprived our country of its legitimate seat in the United Nations, but also, according to Dulles' statement in 1956, played with fire on the "brink of war" three times, attempting to impose war on China: That is, during the Korean War, the United States had "chosen" "targets in Manchuria" and wanted to brazenly "use atomic weapons"; the second time was when the United States planned to directly participate in the Indochina War and attack our South China region with atomic weapons; the third time was in 1955, when the U.S. Congress passed a resolution authorizing the President to use force to obstruct our country from liberating its own territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands. However, the Chinese People's Volunteers' just war to aid the Korean people defeated the U.S. aggressors. The U.S.'s conspiracy to interfere in and expand the Indochina War went bankrupt. The U.S.'s continuous military provocations against our country cannot shake our people's determination to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands. The U.S.'s three "brink of war" games aimed at our country ended in a bloody nose and loss of prestige.

What makes the U.S. aggressors tremble is that all U.S. aggressive activities hostile to China cannot prevent China from growing stronger and developing at an unprecedented and astonishing speed, and cannot prevent China's international prestige and status from increasing day by day.

In the past few years, at what astonishing speed has the new China grown and developed? Let's just take the growth rate of steel production in the United States after its independence as a comparison. In the twenty-four years (1880-1904) of the rise of capitalism, U.S. steel production only increased eightfold, and the United Kingdom even less than threefold; in the more than fifty years of the imperialist era, U.S. steel production only increased eightfold, and the United Kingdom less than four and a half times. However, what is the growth of steel production in the new China after liberation? China has increased from the highest output of more than 900,000 tons before liberation in 1943 to 5.35 million tons in 1957. This year alone, it will double again, reaching 10.7 million tons. What kind of speed is this? In just nine years, China's steel production will increase more than tenfold. This speed exceeds the twenty-four years of the rise of American capitalism and the more than fifty years of the American imperialist era! Can the American gentlemen imagine how much time the new China will need to leave you behind in the future? If you dare not imagine, then can people at least ask: Where is the basis for your expectation of the "disappearance" of the new China? How much is your non-recognition worth?

More and more Western bourgeois figures have seen the facts of the great leap forward in socialist construction in the new China and have sharply criticized and ridiculed the U.S.'s policy of hostility toward China. British political commentator Magritz said that in the next ten years or so, China will become one of the world's major industrial countries, and the Chinese regime will definitely continue to exist and become more prosperous. The U.S.'s practice of treating the Chiang Kai-shek clique as China is as ridiculous as buying "dead souls." Muir, Chairman of the Royal Bank of Canada, said: "It is staggering to see the achievements they (the Chinese people) have made in less than ten years." He believes that the U.S.'s practice of betting on the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan is ridiculous. Chamberlain, Chairman of the Australian Labor Party Federation, pointed out: "If we allow ourselves to wear biased political blinders so that we cannot see the existence of 600 million people engaged in one of the greatest socio-economic experiments in human history, we can only bear the danger ourselves." Hyman, a professor at the University of California, also admitted that China is "engaged in the most enviable work in the world" and that "China's economic and military strength seems to be increasing rapidly." It should be said that when Western bourgeois figures estimate the tremendous changes in the new China, where one day equals twenty years, they always discount it greatly, and some people never even understand it, and it is of course even more difficult for them to understand the reasons for this change. However, in any case, the kind of granite-like brains exhibited in the U.S. State Department memorandum are becoming less and less.

Furthermore, in the nine years of U.S. hostility toward China, at what speed has the new China's international status and prestige increased? No matter how the United States coerces many countries not to recognize China, the population of the twenty-nine countries that recognize China plus the population of the new China already accounts for nearly 60% of the world's population. If we calculate the population of countries that have trade relations and friendly exchanges with the new China, then the U.S.'s policy of non-recognition will appear even more ridiculous. In the past few years, the U.S.'s increasingly difficult and despicable acts of coercing a majority of countries in the United Nations to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate seat have been a ridiculous performance. Not only that, but the new China's right to speak and its role in international affairs are not affected at all by the U.S.'s deprivation of our country's status in international conferences. China abides by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, gets along with all countries in friendship, actively participates in the struggle against aggression and safeguarding peace, and firmly supports the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which is increasingly severely striking at U.S. imperialism's pursuit of aggressive and war policies. The more the United States engages in vicious slander and smears against the new China, the more clearly it exposes its wolfish ambitions to invade Asian and African countries and its helpless embarrassment towards the struggle of the Asian and African people for independence.

The memorandum just confirms this point. The memorandum's attacks on the new China's foreign policy can be said to have gone to extremes, such as China's "aggression" and "expansion," etc. However, all these cliches taken from the already worn-out anti-communist arsenal since Hitler and Tojo cannot scare others, but can only scare itself. The memorandum cannot hide how afraid the United States is of the new China's strong development and that the new China's support for the national independence movement "seriously hinders" the United States from achieving its aggressive "goals." The memorandum also admits: The United States has "some special considerations," fearing that the failure of the U.S.'s policy of hostility toward China will "seriously damage" the U.S.'s control over the United Nations, undermine the U.S.'s "embargo" policy, "frustrate" or even "destroy" the Chiang Kai-shek clique, cause the United States to lose the "strategic island of Taiwan," ruin the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," thereby causing countries "closely allied with the United States," especially South Korea and South Vietnam, to "feel extremely confused and frustrated," and "put the entire free world's position in Asia in the most serious danger." May I ask, in this way, hasn't the U.S. State Department's article gone to its opposite? Doesn't it just prove that the U.S.'s policy of hostility toward China has become an important component of the U.S.'s entire aggressive and war policy of dominating the Far East and the world, and that the Chinese people's resolute struggle against U.S. interventionists and aggressors will not only completely shatter the U.S.'s policy of hostility toward China, but also "affect the whole body with one move," causing the U.S.'s entire aggressive and war policy to suffer a fatal blow?

From here, it seems that whether the U.S.'s logic of bandit diplomacy is effective, or whether the logic that the Chinese people and all just humanity will inevitably defeat U.S. imperialism is effective; whether the U.S.'s policy of hostility toward China has "accelerated" the "disappearance" of the new China, or whether it has truly accelerated its own complete bankruptcy, is already as obvious and certain as one plus one equals two.

Now, the U.S. memorandum proves that the United States will not shed tears even when it sees the coffin. Not only is it stubbornly sticking to its policy of hostility toward China, but it is also carrying out the most dangerous military adventures against the new China in the Taiwan Strait region, attempting to use war gambling to save the complete bankruptcy of its policy of hostility toward China. However, only a madman cannot see that the Chinese people, who have continuously defeated the U.S. aggressors in the Liberation War and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, today have even more favorable domestic and international conditions and are fully confident of shattering any of the U.S.'s vicious war plans. As Chairman Mao pointed out, the other end of the noose is firmly grasped in the hands of the Chinese people and the people of the world. War will only accelerate the arrival of the day when the United States will be executed. The Chinese people's resolute struggle against the U.S. warmongering clique is not only necessary for restoring the integrity of Chinese territory and safeguarding national security, but is also conducive to the struggle of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries for independence and freedom, and conducive to the struggle of the people of the world to prevent war and defend peace.

    美国的强盗逻辑
    ——评美国国务院关于不承认中国的备忘录
    胡今
    美国国务院发表的备忘录，硬着头皮不承认它敌视中国的政策是不现实的。备忘录公然叫嚣：“美国认为，共产主义在中国的统治不是永久性的，它有朝一日总会消失的”。而美国不承认中国的作法，就是为了“加速这种消失的过程”。这是去年6月杜勒斯发表的“我们对中国共产主义的政策”的演说的重复。当时，杜勒斯就说美国敌视中国的政策，是以新中国“是一种要消逝的、而不是一种永久的现象”的估计为“根据”的。他无耻地宣称：“如果我们认为，我们同（中国）现政权建立外交关系能够促进这种消逝，那末，我们就建立这种关系”。
    看！美国就是这样敌视中国人民：不承认我国，固然是要“加速”我国的“消逝”；承认，也是要“促进”我国的“消逝”。承认或不承认你，都是为了消灭你，这就是美国的强盗外交的逻辑。这是对新中国的何等狂妄的野心！这是美帝国主义凶恶面目的大暴露！
    美国这种强盗式的外交逻辑，是对国际法的标准和美国独立宣言以及杰裴逊提出的美国外交原则的公然践踏。备忘录企图引用杰裴逊的话来为美国敌视中国的侵略政策辩解，更是对杰裴逊的侮辱。现代国际法的基本原则承认每一主权国家都享有公认的基本权利，并负有公认的基本义务，如领土完整和主权受到尊重的权利以及与此相适应的不得侵犯他国领土完整和主权的义务，进行国际交往、参加各种国际组织的权利以及相应的义务等等；这些权利和义务是任何国家所固有，而不以外交承认为转移的。美国1776年的独立宣言，也承认人民有权利变更政府或废除政府而成立新的政府，把新政府设在最能保障人民的安全与幸福的原则之上，并用符合于这种原则的形式组织它的权力。1793年在华盛顿总统手下任国务卿的杰裴逊（1800年被选为第三任总统），曾提出美国外交政策的原则应该是：“让任何国家得到我们自己的政府借以建立的权利，根据它所喜欢的形式来治理自己，并按照自己的意志来改变这些形式。”试问，这同美国霸占我国领土台湾、干涉我国内政和剥夺我国在联合国的合法席位的行为，怎么能够相容呢？这同美国独立宣言和杰裴逊提出的原则，又有何共同之处呢？美国“现代史料”今年3月号刊载的芝加哥大学国际法名誉教授昆西·赖特所写的一篇文章，就认为“美国仍旧不承认中国的共产党政府的做法，是违反国际法的正常期望和华盛顿在1793年承认法国的革命政府的时候所开始的美国传统外交政策的”。
    美国违反国际法标准的行为，写满了它一百多年血腥侵略的历史。美国背弃华盛顿、杰裴逊和林肯的传统政策，则是美国在独立后迅速发展成为帝国主义和全世界反动势力的中心的结果，这都是丝毫不足为奇的。问题是，腐朽、没落而又反动透顶的帝国主义时代，正在让位于社会主义的时代、民族解放的时代。在这种新时代下，美帝国主义的强盗外交逻辑，对于所有敢于坚持独立自由、同帝国主义作坚决斗争的人民已经根本行不通，不管它承认或不承认，不管它使用什么卑鄙手段包括军事侵略在内，都不能“消灭”一个接着一个兴起的社会主义国家，一个接着一个兴起的民族独立国家。美国十六年不承认苏联，还参加了可耻的十四个帝国主义武装干涉，承认苏联后又包围它、威胁它，直到希特勒德国进攻苏联后还想等待“两败俱伤”、最后由美国收拾残局的日子到来，但结果如何呢？战后东欧社会主义国家大批兴起了，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国也出现了，美国对这些国家不管是承认还是不承认，都公然打着“解放”的黑旗敌视它们，还发动了侵朝战争，干预印度支那战争，策动了匈牙利反革命暴乱，但结果又如何呢？杜勒斯咒骂美国已承认了的民族独立国家的中立政策，粗暴地干涉这些国家的内政，公开支持印度尼西亚的叛乱集团，打着“艾森豪威尔主义”的黑旗，策划军事侵略美国已经承认了的叙利亚，这次更凶恶地派兵侵略中东，结果又如何呢？
    美国敌视中国人民的政策的破产，也同样是明摆着的事实。鸦片战争以后美国侵略中国的血腥历史且不去说它。单从中国人民解放战争到中华人民共和国成立九年的短短时间来说，中国人民就是作为人类历史发展中的一支新生力量，冲破美帝国主义的层层干涉、侵略和敌视，而取得自己的胜利的。1949年8月美国国务院发表的“中美关系”白皮书和最近美国国务院发表的备忘录，就是美国敌视中国的政策的一连串失败的招供。美国当年的白皮书曾不得不供认中国人民的革命风暴势不可挡地粉碎了美国的干涉和侵略：“中国内战的不幸结果为美国政府控制所不及。美国在它能力的合理限度之内所曾经做的或能够做的，都不能改变这个结果。美国所未做的，对于这个结果也没有影响。这是中国内部势力的产物，这些势力美国也曾试图加以影响，但不能有效。”九年来，不甘失败的美帝国主义不仅侵占我国台湾，扶植蒋介石集团，对我国实行“禁运”，剥夺我国在联合国的合法席位，而且按照1956年杜勒斯的说法，曾三次在“战争边缘”玩火，企图把战争强加在中国身上：这就是在侵朝战争时期，美国曾“选择”了“满洲的目标”，想悍然“使用原子武器”；第二次是美国打算直接参加印度支那战争，并用原子武器袭击我华南地区；第三次是1955年美国国会通过决议，授权总统使用武力阻挠我国解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿。但是，中国人民志愿军援助朝鲜人民的正义战争，击败了美国侵略者。美国干涉和扩大印度支那战争的阴谋遭到了破产。美国对我国不断进行的军事挑衅也丝毫不能动摇我国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的决心。美国针对我国的这三次“战争边缘”玩火，碰得头破血流，威信扫地。
    使美国侵略者发抖的是，美国一切敌视中国的侵略活动，都不能阻止中国以史无前例的惊人速度强大发展起来，不能阻止中国国际威望和地位的日益提高。
    几年来新中国是以怎样惊人的速度，强大发展着的呢？仅拿美国独立后钢产量的增长速度来作个比较吧。在资本主义上升时期的二十四年（1880年—1904年），美国钢产量只增长了八倍，英国更不到三倍；在帝国主义时期的五十多年中，美国钢产量也只增长八倍，英国不到四倍半。但是，新中国解放后的钢产量的增长情况如何呢？中国从解放前1943年最高产量的九十多万吨，已增加到1957年的五百三十五万吨。今年一年内更要翻一番，达到一千零七十万吨。这是怎样一种速度？短短不过九年，中国钢产量就要增加十倍以上，这个速度超过美国资本主义上升时期的二十四年，超过美国帝国主义时期的五十多年！美国老爷们可以想像一下今后新中国需要多少时间把你们抛在后面吗？如果不敢想像，那末，人们是否至少可以发问：你们所期望的新中国“消逝”的根据在哪里？你们的不承认，究竟值得几文钱？
    西方资产阶级人士已越来越多地看到了新中国社会主义建设大跃进的事实，尖锐批评和嘲笑美国敌视中国的政策。英国政论家马格里兹说，在今后十年左右的时间里，中国将成为世界主要工业国之一，中国政权肯定地是要存在下去并且要更加兴旺的。美国硬把蒋介石集团当作中国的作法，有如收买“死魂灵”一样可笑。加拿大皇家银行董事长谬尔说：“看到他们（指中国人民）在不到十年的时间内就取得这样的成就，真叫人目瞪口呆”。他认为，美国把赌注押在台湾蒋介石集团身上的做法是滑稽可笑的。澳大利亚工党联邦主席张伯伦指出：“要是我们容许戴着有偏见的政治眼罩，以致看不见从事人类历史上最伟大的社会经济试验之一的六亿人民的存在，其危险只能由我们自己担当”。美国加利福尼亚大学教授黑曼，也承认中国正在“从事着世界上最令人羡慕的工作”，“中国的经济和军事力量似乎正在很快地得到加强”。应该说，西方资产阶级人士在估计新中国一天等于二十年的巨大变化时，总是要打很大的折扣的，甚至有些人始终不能加以理解，要他们认识这个变化的原因当然更加困难。但是，无论如何，像美国国务院备忘录所表现的那种花岗岩般的头脑，到底是越来越少了。
    再说，美国敌视中国的九年中，新中国的国际地位和威望又是以怎样的速度提高着的呢？尽管美国怎样胁迫许多国家不承认中国，但二十九个承认中国的国家的人口加上新中国的人口已占全人类的近60％。如果计算到同新中国发生贸易关系和友好往来的国家的人口，那就更要使美国的不承认政策显得万分可笑。几年来，美国在联合国越来越吃力地胁迫多数国家阻挠恢复中国合法席位的卑劣行径，就是这种可笑的表演。不仅如此，新中国的发言权，它在国际事务中所起的作用，根本就不因美国剥夺我国在国际会议中的地位，而受到影响。中国信守和平共处五项原则，同各国友好相处，积极参加反对侵略、维护和平的斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动，正日益沉重地打击了美帝国主义推行侵略政策和战争政策。美国越是对新中国进行恶毒的诽谤和诬蔑，就越发清楚地暴露它侵略亚非国家的狼子野心和对亚非人民争取独立的斗争莫可奈何的尴尬相。
    备忘录就恰恰证实了这一点。备忘录对新中国的外交政策的攻击，可说到了家，什么中国的“侵略”啦，“扩张”啦，等等，但是，这一切从希特勒、东条以来早已破旧不堪的反共武器库中搬出来的陈词滥调，吓不倒别人，而只能吓住它自己。备忘录不能掩饰美国是何等害怕新中国的强大发展和新中国支持民族独立运动“严重妨碍”美国达到它的侵略“目标”。备忘录还供认：美国有“一些特别考虑”，害怕美国敌视中国政策的失败，会“严重损害”美国对联合国的控制，破坏美国“禁运”政策，“挫伤”甚至“毁了”蒋介石集团，使美国丧失了“战略性的岛屿台湾”，断送制造“两个中国”的阴谋，从而使“同美国结成紧密联盟的”国家特别是南朝鲜和南越“感到极大的迷惑和沮丧”，“使整个自由世界在亚洲的地位处于最严重的险境”。试问这样一来，美国国务院的文章不是做到了它的反面去了吗？不是恰恰证明美国敌视中国的政策，已成了美国独霸远东和世界的整个侵略政策和战争政策的重要组成部分，而中国人民同美国干涉者和侵略者进行的坚决斗争，也就不仅将彻底粉碎美国敌视中国的政策，而且将“牵一发而动全身”，使美国整个侵略政策和战争政策遭到致命的打击吗？
    从这里看来，究竟是美国的强盗外交逻辑灵验，还是中国人民和一切正义人类必然击败美帝国主义的逻辑灵验；究竟是美国敌视中国的政策“加速”了新中国的“消逝”，还是真正加速了它自己的彻底破产，这已经是像一加一等于二那样十分明显和确定不移的了。
    现在，美国备忘录证明，美国就是见了棺材也不会落泪的，它不仅执迷不悟，要继续坚持敌视中国的政策，并且在台湾海峡地区对新中国进行着最危险的军事冒险，妄图以战争赌博来挽救它敌对中国的政策的彻底破产。但是，只有疯子才看不见，在解放战争中，在抗美援朝战争中连续打败了美国侵略者的中国人民，今天已拥有更有利的国内外条件，完全有把握粉碎美国的任何凶恶的战争计划。正如毛主席所指出的，绞索的另一端是紧紧地抓在中国人民和世界各国人民的手中。战争只会加速给美国执行绞刑的日子的到来。中国人民同美国好战集团的坚决斗争，不仅为恢复中国领土的完整，保卫国家的安全所必需，而且有利于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取独立自由的斗争，有利于全世界人民制止战争，保卫和平的斗争。
