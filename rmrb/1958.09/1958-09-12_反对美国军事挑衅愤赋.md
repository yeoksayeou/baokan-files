Ruthlessly seizing pirate treaties and invading Lebanon,
Once again, they scamper to Taiwan and Penghu, vainly flaunting their might.
Arousing the people's shared anger,
United as one, we condemn the enemy on the eastern seas.
A thunderous roar shakes the heavens,
Solemn declaration to crush the enemy's arrogance,
Worldwide sympathy and condemnation are declared,
Hundreds of millions point their anger at the White House.
I once had the honor to hear righteous arguments,
Colonial aggression, when has it ever stopped?
Knowing how many enemies it makes in the world,
It will eventually see its own end in constraint.
The Soviet Union is the vanguard of the peace bulwark,
Warning the madmen with righteous declarations,
Can gunboats compete with missiles?
The allied forces maintain power soaring to the heavens.
Taiwan and Penghu islands belong to China,
Provocations ultimately lead to a disastrous end,
Waving claws and baring teeth, still acting as accomplices,
Laughing at the mantis trying to stop a cart.
Who can tolerate infringement of sovereignty?
The paper tiger foolishly fights the giant dragon,
We will see the mighty army cross the straits,
And the red flag planted high on Seven Star Peak. (Note)
All eyes glare at the pirate flag,
What words can justify this so-called self-defense?
Swallowing Kinmen and Matsu to annihilate the stubborn enemy,
The liberation of Taiwan is destined to come!

Note: Seven Star Mountain is the highest peak in Taipei.

    反对美国军事挑衅愤赋
  　李济深悍然海盗侵黎约，复窜台澎妄逞凶，激起全民齐怒吼，同仇敌忾海天东。惊天动地一声雷，严正声明敌势摧，举世同情申谴责，兆民怒指白宫哀。正论曾叨末座听，殖民侵略几曾停，世间树敌知多少，束脖终然看自经。和平堡垒首苏联，警告狂人正义宣，炮舰岂能当导弹，同盟维护力冲天。台澎列岛属吾华，挑衅终兴末路嗟，舞爪张牙犹作伥，笑它螳臂敢当车。主权侵犯孰能容，纸虎蠢然斗巨龙，会看雄师横海峡，红旗高插七星峰。（注）众目同瞋海盗旗，安全自卫究何词，气吞金马歼顽敌，解放台湾定有时！
    注：七星山为台北最高峰。
