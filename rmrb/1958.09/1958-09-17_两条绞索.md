Two Nooses
　　Sun Yuanfan

　　The whole world is spreading Chairman Mao's assessment of the American imperialists: they have put a noose around their own necks.

　　History always proves that whoever represents the will of the people can accurately foresee the future.

　　Chairman Mao's description of the noose around the necks of American aggressors is, based on the experience of the Chinese people, an accurate historical prediction: "The Chinese territory of Taiwan, Lebanon, and all American military bases abroad are nooses around the neck of American imperialism. It is not others, but the Americans themselves who made these nooses and put them around their own necks, while handing the other end of the noose to the Chinese people, the people of Arab countries, and all peace-loving and anti-aggression people of the world."

　　These vivid and figurative words naturally remind people of a similar prediction made by Chairman Mao about Chiang Kai-shek's fate thirteen years ago. In 1945, on the eve of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the strong pressure of the Chinese people demanding the abolition of the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship, Chiang Kai-shek had to pretend to "return power to the people," and disregarded the warnings of the Chinese Communist Party, obstinately insisting on convening a so-called "National Assembly" manipulated by the Kuomintang. Chairman Mao wrote in "On Coalition Government": "The steps our anti-people heroes are preparing to take in accordance with this divisive policy carry the danger of pushing themselves to a dead end. They are preparing to put a rope around their own necks, and let it never be untied; the name of this rope is 'National Assembly.' Their original intention was to use the so-called 'National Assembly' as a magic weapon, to offer it up, first, to resist the coalition government, second, to maintain dictatorial rule, and third, to prepare for a reason for civil war. However, the logic of history will go in the opposite direction to what they imagined, 'lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet.'"

　　Sure enough, on the eve of Chiang Kai-shek's demise, he convened the so-called "National Assembly," pushing himself to a dead end, and getting caught in the rope that he himself had put on, one that could never be untied.

　　Reactionaries who run counter to history always dig their own graves and put the noose around their own necks. The reason is that their observation of problems is absolutely the opposite of the people: we say the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, they say the West Wind prevails over the East Wind; we say this is a noose, they say this is a lifebuoy. Chiang Kai-shek once regarded the "National Assembly" as a lifebuoy. In 1945, he was still the "leader of the War of Resistance" in Chongqing, with Hurley's support, waiting for victory, very smug; in 1946, he was still in Nanjing, occupying Zhangjiakou, with Acheson's support, self-electing himself "president," invincible. At that time, how could he understand that he had already put on the noose, only waiting for the final pull by the Chinese people.

　　How similar history is! No matter how much more smug American imperialism seems today than Chiang Kai-shek was in those years, isn't Chairman Mao's assessment of Chiang Kai-shek in "On Coalition Government" completely applicable to Eisenhower today? Here, it is only necessary to change a few nouns: "Their original intention is to use Taiwan, Lebanon, and all military bases as magic weapons, to offer them up, first, to resist the Chinese, Arab, and all peace-loving and anti-aggression people of the world, second, to maintain their imperialist rule, and third, to prepare to fight a third world war. However, the logic of history will go in the opposite direction to what they imagined, 'lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet.'"

　　Eisenhower is both Chiang Kai-shek's teacher and Chiang Kai-shek's student, and let's see how he first teaches his student to put on the noose, and then learns from his student how to put on the noose himself.

    两条绞索
    孙元凡
    全世界都在传播毛主席对美帝国主义者所作的论断：自己套上了绞索。
    历史总是证明，谁代表了人民的意志，谁就能准确地预见未来。
    毛主席对美国侵略者套上绞索的描述，根据中国人民的经验，是准确的历史预言：“中国领土台湾、黎巴嫩以及所有美国在外国的军事基地，都是套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索。不是别人而是美国人自己制造这种绞索，并把它套在自己的脖子上，而把绞索的另一端交给了中国人民、阿拉伯各国人民和全世界一切爱和平反侵略的人民。”
    这一段生动而形象的话，使人们自然想起十三年以前，毛主席关于蒋介石的命运所作的类似的预言。1945年，抗日战争胜利的前夕，在中国人民要求废止国民党一党专政的强大压力之下，蒋介石不得不装扮“还政于民”，而不顾中国共产党的警告，一意孤行地要召开一个由国民党一手包办的所谓“国民大会”。毛主席在“论联合政府”中这样写道：“我们的反人民的英雄们根据这种分裂方针所准备采取的步骤，有把他们自己推到绝路上去的危险。他们准备把一条绳索套在自己的脖子上，并且让它永远也解不开，这条绳索的名称就叫做‘国民大会’。他们的原意是想把所谓‘国民大会’当作法宝，祭起来，一则抵制联合政府，二则维持独裁统治，三则准备内战理由。可是，历史的逻辑将向他们所设想的反面走去，‘搬起石头打自己的脚’。”
    果然，蒋介石复亡的前夕，他召开了所谓“国民大会”，自己将自己推到绝路上，被自己套上的这条永远也解不开的绳索。
    同历史背道而驰的反动派，总是自己替自己掘坟墓，自己把绞索套在自己脖子上的。原因就是他们观察问题同人民绝对相反：我们说东风压倒西风，他们说西风压倒东风；我们说这是绞索，他们说这是救生圈。蒋介石就曾经将“国民大会”当作救生圈。1945年，他还在重庆当“抗战领袖”，有赫尔利的支持，坐待胜利，神气得很；1946年，他还在南京，占领了张家口，有艾奇逊的支持，自选“总统”，不可一世。这个时候他怎能了解自己已套上绞索，只差中国人民最后一勒了。
    历史何其相似！不论今天美帝国主义比当年蒋介石好像更要神气得多，可是毛主席在“论联合政府”上对蒋介石所作的论断，不是完全适用于今天的艾森豪威尔吗？这儿只需要改换几个名词：“他们的原意是想把台湾、黎巴嫩及所有的军事基地当作法宝，祭起来，一则抵制中国、阿拉伯和全世界爱和平反侵略的人民，二则维持他的帝国主义统治，三则准备打第三次世界大战。可是历史的逻辑将向他们所设想的反面走去，‘搬起石头打自己的脚。’”
    艾森豪威尔是蒋介石的先生又是蒋介石的学生，且看他在教学生套上绞索之后又学学生如何套上绞索。
