　　Good Students in Labor, Good Teachers in the Classroom:
　　Going to Production Practice to Make Up Lessons
    Many Teachers in Sichuan Universities Participate in Work-Study Programs

    (Our Newspaper Correspondents Zhou Zuyou and Li Desen report) Many teachers in Sichuan Province's universities, after participating in work-study programs, said: Empty theories of armchair strategists can only be completely defeated in the face of reality. Many teachers who previously neglected practical operations have also stepped out of the narrow world of books and classrooms to make up lessons in production practice.

    Currently, more and more teachers in Sichuan Province's universities are participating in work-study programs. According to statistics from Sichuan University, Chengdu Institute of Radio Engineering, and five other universities alone, over 1,300 teachers are directly participating in and guiding student work-study programs, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of teachers in these schools. Teachers participate in work-study programs in various forms. Science and engineering teachers mainly lead students to accept commissions from local industrial departments, conduct various engineering surveys and designs, participate in installation, repair, and construction work in factories and mines, or conduct analysis and testing of soil, minerals, and building materials for construction units. Teachers in arts, history, medicine, finance, and economics mostly go to the countryside and factories with students or participate in agricultural, industrial, and other production labor on campus. Recently, most teachers have also participated in students' large-scale factory building and trial production of various new products. They serve as factory directors, engineers, and technicians in these factories.

    When the vast majority of teachers left the narrow classrooms and studies and entered the vast production sites, they realized that they were the most ignorant people in the face of production reality. Those who lecture in chemistry cannot test the carbon content of steel; those who teach mechanics do not understand the simplest technical operations. A teacher in the Power Department of Chongqing University copied a hydropower station gate design from a book for an agricultural cooperative, which was both labor-intensive and expensive. After farmers proposed "local methods" and made major modifications, it was not only convenient to use but also saved more than 100 yuan. Even the theoretical knowledge that teachers have always prided themselves on is far from the needs of production practice. They talk more about foreign materials in class, less about Chinese materials; more about modernization and automation, less about small and medium-sized construction projects. A teacher in the Physics Department of Sichuan University used a textbook published in France more than 50 years ago. After the test of production practice, teachers realized that the past situation of teaching divorced from reality must be changed. Many school teachers are preparing to move the classroom more to the production site and combine teaching and production labor more closely.

    Teachers have enriched their practical knowledge in work-study programs, have begun to understand the principles that education must be combined with productive labor and that theory must be combined with practice. Their scientific research activities have gradually become closely integrated with production practice, and their professional level has also been greatly improved. Many teachers at Chengdu Institute of Technology, Sichuan Normal University, Sichuan University, and other schools have revised their scientific research work plans, replacing purely theoretical research topics that are divorced from reality with research topics that are closely related to production practice or urgently need to be resolved in the current national construction. These topics include important research topics on the Three Gorges Hydropower Station, dynamic model manufacturing, and comprehensive utilization of sweet potatoes, and so on. Industrial electronics teachers in the Electrical Engineering Department of Chengdu Institute of Technology only had book knowledge in the past, but recently, after mobilizing all teachers and students to manufacture an analog electronic computer, not only these teachers but also the industrial electronics level of all teachers in the department has been significantly improved. In the past, teachers did not dare to touch this cutting-edge science, but now they have practical experience and are confident in opening an electronic computer major.

    In work-study programs, teachers see the soaring enthusiasm of workers and peasants in building the motherland, and they see the various urgent requirements of production construction for science and technology. They all feel that teaching work must make a great leap forward. Many teachers and students stay up all night together to trial-produce new products; even old professors in their sixties and seventies who never go to the laboratory personally guide students in the school's factory.

    Practice is the most eloquent. Now, many teachers who were skeptical about work-study programs have gradually participated in this activity. Yang Sheng, a professor in the Department of Industrial Economics at Sichuan University of Finance and Economics, used to be a skeptic. He didn't believe that students could use indigenous methods to make steel. He thought it was just a fantasy to make steel without mechanical equipment. However, it was with indigenous methods that the students really made steel. After visiting the students' labor achievements, he became an activist and worked hard with the students. He said: Work-study is the main road for intellectuals to go from books to reality.

### 劳动中的好学生　课堂上的好先生  到生产实际中去补课  四川许多高等学校教师参加勤工俭学活动

    劳动中的好学生　课堂上的好先生
　　到生产实际中去补课
    四川许多高等学校教师参加勤工俭学活动
    本报讯　记者周祖佑、李德森报道：四川省许多高等学校教师在参加勤工俭学活动以后说：纸上谈兵的空洞理论，在实际面前只能全军复没。不少过去忽视实际操作的教师，也纷纷走出书本和课堂的狭小天地，到生产实际中去补课。
    现在，四川省各高等学校教师参加勤工俭学活动的已经愈来愈多。仅据四川大学、成都电讯工程学院等七所高等学校的统计，直接参加和指导学生勤工俭学活动的教师，就有一千三百多人，占这些学校在校教师总数的80％以上。教师们参加勤工俭学活动的形式是多种多样的。理、工科教师主要是领导学生接受地方工业部门委托，进行各种工程任务的勘测、设计，到厂矿企业参加安装、修理和施工工作，或为建设单位进行土壤、矿石和建筑材料的分析化验等；文、史、医、财经等科教师，则多数与学生一道下乡、下厂或在校内参加农业、工业等生产劳动。最近大部分教师还参加了学生们大办工厂、试制各种新产品的活动。他们在这些工厂中担任厂长、工程师和技术员。
    当广大教师离开了狭小的课堂和书室，走进广阔的生产现场，他们才发现自己在生产实际面前，却原来是最无知识的人。讲化学的，不会化验钢的含碳量；教机械的，不懂最简单的技术操作。重庆大学动力系一个教师照搬书本为农业社设计的水电站闸门，又费工又花钱；经过农民提出“土办法”大加修改后，不仅使用方便，还节约了一百多元。即使教师们一向自恃的理论知识，与生产实际的需要相距也很远。他们在课堂上讲外国的材料多，讲中国的少，讲现代化、自动化多，讲中小型的建设少。四川大学物理系一个教师用的教材竟是五十多年前法国出版的东西。经过生产实际的考验，教师们认识到，过去那种脱离实际的教学状况必须改变了。许多学校的教师准备把课堂更多地搬到生产现场上去，把教学和生产劳动更紧密地结合起来。
    教师们在勤工俭学活动中丰富了实际知识，开始懂得了教育必须与生产劳动结合、理论必须与实际结合的道理，他们的科学研究活动逐步与生产实际紧密结合起来，业务水平也大大提高。成都工学院、四川师范学院、四川大学等校许多教师都修订了科学研究工作的计划，用与生产实际密切联系或当前国家建设中迫切需要解决的研究题目，代替了脱离实际的纯理论研究性质的题目。这些题目中有关于三峡水电站的重要研究题目，有动态模型制造，有甘薯的综合利用等等。成都工学院电机系工业电子学教师过去只有些书本知识，但是最近在全系师、生动员起来制造模拟电子计算机后，不仅这几个教师，全系教师的工业电子学水平都显著提高。过去，教师们对这门尖端科学是不敢动的，现在他们有了实践经验，要开办电子计算机专业也有把握了。
    在勤工俭学活动中，教师们看到工人、农民建设祖国的冲天干劲，看到生产建设对科学技术提出的各种迫切要求，都感到教学工作必须大跃进。许多教师与学生一起熬夜试制新产品；连六、七十岁的从不下实验室的老教授，也亲自到校内工厂对学生进行指导。
    实践是最雄辩的。现在，不少对勤工俭学抱怀疑态度的教师，也逐步地参加到这一活动中来。四川财经学院工业经济系教授杨声，曾经是个怀疑派，学生要用土法炼钢，他不相信，认为没有机械设备想炼钢，只是空想。但是，正是用土办法，学生们却真把钢炼出来了。他参观了学生们的劳动成果后，变成了积极分子，与学生一起苦干起来。他说：勤工俭学是知识分子从书本通向实际的大道。
