Reported by our correspondent Ji Xichen: Sichuan is carrying out a large-scale communist education movement in conjunction with the establishment of people's communes, eliminating individualism and departmentalism, and establishing collectivism and communism. Based on deep and thorough ideological work, the people's commune movement is developing rapidly and healthily. More than 100 people's communes have now been established throughout the province, and the 4,000 people's communes planned for the entire province will be basically completed by the end of September.

In carrying out communist education, all localities first publicize the general line and the great achievements of the great leap forward and great victories in agricultural production. They summarize the advanced experiences of large communes in farmland capital construction and agricultural production increase, as well as the experience of communist-style large-scale cooperation between townships and societies over the past year, and publicize the superiority of the people's communes in integrating industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. This further allows the broad masses to see a bright future from the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, thereby attracting millions of people to consciously and voluntarily participate in the people's communes. The Penglai District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Pengxi County, through summarizing the experience of the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative in implementing township-society integration and engaging in large-scale production for three years, transforming more than 8,000 mu of barren slopes into fertile land, building two hydroelectric power stations, operating more than 30 kinds of sideline production, and expanding public accumulation by more than 800,000 yuan, the masses realized that only by following the road of the people's communes can they move towards a happy communist society. Therefore, more than 30,000 households and 140,000 people in the district have all signed up to join the Red Flag People's Commune.

During the movement, Wenjiang, Nanchong, Neijiang and other places adopted the forms of extensive airing of views, big debates, and big-character posters to educate cadres and the masses to deal with certain economic issues in merging societies and building societies from the standpoint of collective interests and the overall situation in the spirit of communism, and to eliminate individualism and departmentalism. The Shangyou People's Commune in Wenjiang County, which was formed by the merger of 167 agricultural cooperatives, faced differences in public wealth and production base between large and small cooperatives, and between rich and poor cooperatives, when the commune was established. Initially, some rich cooperatives were afraid of suffering losses and were unwilling to merge, and a few cadres had slackened their efforts due to considering personal gains and losses and fearing that they would change from "mother-in-law to daughter-in-law" after the merger. In response to these ideological situations, heated discussions were launched among the masses on the issues of what attitude should be taken towards the commune, whether it was right to privately divide, distribute, empty, and waste before the merger, how the rich cooperatives became rich, and how party members and cadres should serve the people. After the debate, everyone further realized that when dealing with contradictions among the people, local interests should be subordinate to the interests of the commune, immediate interests should be subordinate to long-term interests, and individual interests should be subordinate to collective interests. Because the policy and ideological boundaries were clearly defined and the communist consciousness was raised, everyone no longer haggled over trivial matters, and also took the initiative to transfer all the public property and means of production of the various small cooperatives to the commune. No action was taken on the small poultry, livestock, small forests and living materials of the members, which further boosted the enthusiasm of the masses, and the commune increased by more than 1,000 pigs in two days.

In the work of establishing people's communes, Sichuan Province conscientiously implemented the class policy of relying on poor and lower-middle peasant members in agricultural cooperatives and uniting with upper-middle peasant members. Before establishing communes, all localities first held forums and heart-to-heart talks with poor peasant members to explain policies and methods, unify ideological understanding, and everyone was in high spirits and became the backbone of the work of establishing communes. Before the establishment of the commune, Anjing Township in Pi County specially trained a propaganda team dominated by poor peasant members. They used methods such as connecting heart-to-heart talks and visiting door-to-door to explain policies and help some middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasant members dispel their worries. There were 32 well-to-do middle peasant households in Yongxing Township, Wenjiang County, who had always worked independently in the past. Recently, with the help and education of poor and lower-middle peasant members, after calculating accounts and comparisons, they all signed up to join the Shangyou People's Commune. In the process of building the commune, the vast number of peasants, mainly poor peasant members, also severely exposed and cracked down on the rumors and sabotage of illegal landlords and rich peasants. Because of the selfless spirit and active role shown by the poor and lower-middle peasant members in the construction of the commune, they have been warmly supported by the masses, and the leadership advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants has been established in the leadership work of the commune.

    四川农村普遍进行共产主义教育
    人民公社运动健康发展
    本报讯　记者纪希晨报道：四川各地结合建立人民公社大规模开展共产主义教育运动，破除个人主义、本位主义，树立集体主义、共产主义，在思想工作做深做透的基础上，人民公社运动正迅速健康地发展。现在全省已建立一百多个人民公社，到9月底全省规划的四千个人民公社将基本建完。
    在进行共产主义教育中，各地首先通过宣传总路线和农业生产大丰收、大跃进、大胜利的成绩，通过总结各地大社农田基本建设、农业增产的先进经验和一年来乡社之间实行共产主义大协作的经验，宣传人民公社实行工农商学兵合一的优越性，这就使广大人民进一步从工农业大跃进看到光辉的未来，从而吸引千百万群众自觉自愿的参加到人民公社中来。中共蓬溪县蓬莱区委通过总结红旗农业社三年来实行乡社合一、大搞生产，把八千多亩瘠薄坡地改为良田，修建二个水电站，经营三十多种副业生产，扩大公共积累八十多万元的经验中，群众认清只有沿着人民公社的道路，才能走向幸福的共产主义社会，因之全区三万多户十四万多人全都报名参加入红旗人民公社。
    在运动中，温江、南充、内江等地采用大鸣大放大辩论大字报形式教育干部和群众以共产主义精神从集体利益和全局观点出发，处理并社建社中的若干经济问题，破除个人主义和本位主义。由一百六十七个农业社合并成的温江县上游人民公社，建立公社时，大社与小社、富社与穷社之间，由于公共财富和生产基础存在着差别，开初个别富社怕吃亏不愿合并，少数干部因考虑个人得失怕并社后自己由“婆婆变为媳妇”，一度产生松劲情绪。针对这些思想情况，在群众中普遍以应拿什么态度对待公社？并社前私自分多分空浪费对不对？富社大社是怎样富裕起来的？党员干部如何为人民服务等问题，展开热烈的讨论。经过辩论大家进一步认识在处理人民内部矛盾时要局部利益服从公社利益，眼前利益服从长远利益，个人利益服从集体利益。由于划清了政策思想界限，提高了共产主义觉悟，大家不再斤斤计较小事了，还主动将各小社的公共财产和生产资料全部移交给公社，对社员个人的小家禽家畜、小林木和生活资料则一律不动，这样更加鼓舞群众的劲头，公社两天增加一千多头毛猪。
    四川省在建立人民公社的工作中，认真贯彻执行了依靠农业社中的贫农、下中农社员和团结上中农社员的阶级政策。各地在建社之前都首先召开贫农社员座谈会、谈心会交代政策、作法，统一思想认识，个个情绪高涨，成为建立公社工作中的骨干分子。郫县安靖乡在建社之前，专门训练了一支以贫农社员为主的宣传队伍，他们采用串连谈心、登门拜访等方式讲解政策，帮助一部分中农和富裕中农社员打消顾虑。温江县永兴乡有富裕中农三十二户，过去一直单干，最近在贫农、下中农社员的帮助教育下，经过算账对比，都报名参加上游人民公社。在建社过程中，以贫农社员为主的广大农民还狠狠地揭发和打击了不法地主、富农的造谣和破坏行为。由于贫农、下中农社员在建社中表现出的大公无私精神和积极作用，他们都受到群众热烈拥护，在公社的领导工作中树立了贫农、下中农的领导优势。
