Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd, Moscow Dispatch from TASS: The "Truth Daily" editorial department has received many letters from readers asking for clarification of the essence of the French situation. Many readers have also recently raised this question: How should De Gaulle's talks with Adenauer be evaluated?

The "Truth Daily" editorial department asked Comrade N.S. Khrushchev to express his views on these issues. Today, "Truth Daily" published Comrade Khrushchev's reply. The full text is as follows:

The situation in France cannot but cause concern to the Soviet people. Historical experience proves that the fate of this Western country is closely linked to the fate of the entire Europe. Twenty years ago, the shameful Munich collusion with Hitler opened the door to the Second World War. Twenty years later, the conspiracy of the French reactionaries to walk that old path naturally attracts the close attention of all those who cherish the cause of peace. Therefore, it is natural that the Soviet people, while fully adhering to their principled position of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, vigilantly watch the development of the French situation, which is most directly related to the issue of European security.

"Truth Daily" readers are rightly concerned in their letters about how the situation in France has changed since the fascist rebellion in Algeria in May.

    Some People's Illusions About De Gaulle Have Been Shattered

Three or four months ago, some people in Europe consoled themselves with the hope that the new government led by General De Gaulle would be willing and able to restrain the fascist rebels, end the unjust colonialist war against the Algerian people, and maintain the republican system in France. It is true that the progressive forces at that time warned that all these hopes were nothing but empty and harmful illusions, and that there was a most direct causal relationship between the Algerian events and the ruling of the new government in Paris.

Real life quickly shattered these illusions. On July 14, the French National Day, the generals and colonels who participated in the rebellion received medals and promotions. Paratroopers who flew from Algeria to participate in the military review appeared in Paris in a victorious manner, as if they were walking in a conquered city. Among those kind-hearted people who were misled, many began to have doubts after seeing this situation. Now, as people begin to launch frenzied activities to formulate a new constitution that gives the head of government all-encompassing dictatorial powers, the hypocrisy of the new government's so-called mission of national salvation becomes even clearer.

Currently, on the eve of the referendum on the draft new constitution, people are redoubling their efforts to create a legal illusion for the coup being planned in France. This is to facilitate the implementation of far-reaching plans by those who sent the signal of rebellion in Algeria on May 13.

    West European Reactionary Forces Try to Restore Fascism

The situation in France cannot be viewed in isolation from the overall situation in Western Europe. Throughout the post-war period, the imperialist reactionary forces, which were destroyed in the Second World War (when fascism in Germany and Italy was crushed), stubbornly tried to consolidate their shaken positions. In these thirteen years, they have repeatedly attempted to restore fascism in new forms and under new banners.

In Western Europe, from time to time, in this country or that, the ruling groups have turned from tactics of conciliation and parliamentary methods to open dictatorship and brutal suppression of democratic forces. This attempt has been resolutely opposed by the people everywhere, who have become wiser through their experience in fighting Hitler's fascism. But in some places, the reactionary forces have achieved temporary victories, as in West Germany, where the militarists have banned the activities of progressive organizations. Now, the same tactical line is taking shape in France.

    New Constitution Makes Parliament's Role Meaningless

The plan to establish a personal dictatorship, which is the basis of the new constitution, makes the role of parliament meaningless; the implementation of the most severe police persecution system, in some places, such as Algeria, even implements Hitler-style terror; letting military leaders usurp commanding positions in state institutions; even the freedoms granted by bourgeois democracy are gradually being cancelled; the social fruits of the working class are in danger of being deprived, and the democratic organizations of the working class are under attack - all this cannot but remind people of the situation in Germany in 1933. Therefore, today it can be said with full justification that France is facing a fascist threat.

It is no accident that French monopoly capital is now putting desperadoes on the stage of national political life. These desperadoes are simply like twins to the hooligans who ran rampant in Germany in 1932-1933. The former spy Soustelle, the Algerian pacifier General Massu, the Vichy element de Serigny who served Hitler, the former foreign minister of the traitor Petain's government, Georges Bonnet, these are the decision-makers in the current French ruling group, and they are working hard to establish a new constitution for a personal dictatorship.

It is also no accident that the fascist threat is expanding from Algeria (where French colonialists are trying to strangle the national liberation movement of the Algerian people) to France. Jules Guesde, one of the founders of the French Socialist Party, wrote: "Colonial wars are often schools for civil wars. In the war against the Arabs and Kabyles in Algeria, butchers like Cavaignac were cultivated." Guesde was referring to General Cavaignac, who organized the barbaric massacre of Parisian workers in June 1848. He went on to recall that the executioners who massacred the Paris Commune were also trained in colonial expeditions. Now, General Massu, who wants to be a modern Cavaignac, was also trained in the Algerian colonial war, and he shamelessly said that after the new constitution is passed, the progressive forces in France will be "in an illegal position," and he threatened to "execute them according to formal decrees."

    French Ruling Group Abandons Bourgeois Democracy

The French ruling group's abandonment of bourgeois democracy and turn to methods of open violence proves their increasing weakness. The most cunning politicians in the French ruling group, thinking of Hitler's fate, try to dilute the words revealed by General Massu with the following false words, saying that the new constitution can guarantee the maintenance of the republican system and guarantee compliance with the rule of law. At the same time, they also use enticing propaganda. Hitler once tried to buy off the German working class with the so-called "national socialism." Soustelle and his ilk are looking for their own methods of deceiving the masses. Therefore, it is no accident that there is an unprecedented chauvinistic agitation in France today under the banner of patriotism. At the same time, they also put forward a new, American-made theory of "people's capitalism" to the working people, trying to make them believe that "wage labor can be eliminated" while completely preserving private ownership and the system of exploitation....

    French People Actively Oppose the Draft New Constitution

The French reactionaries are trying to establish a fascist system under the banner of legality, using the prestige of General De Gaulle. But in this respect, they are not alone: ​​the "steel magnates" of the Ruhr did the same, when they used the parliament and General Hindenburg, who also enjoyed a certain prestige in his country as the then president, to give all power to the fascists.

Many French people who have fought cruelly against fascism understand this. It is no accident that in the process of preparing for the upcoming referendum, the broad masses of the French people are increasingly actively opposing the draft new constitution. They believe that, as a French social activist recently said, the referendum is to "legalize the coup."

    French Socialist Party Leaders Embark on a Shameful Path

In this situation, the position of the leadership of the French Socialist Party, especially its Secretary-General Mollet, appears even more indecent. He embarked on the shameful path of the right-wing leaders of the German Social Democratic Party, which split the German working class in those sad days when Hitler seized power in 1933. These leaders refused to form a united front with the communists, and they shortsightedly hoped that Hitler would only persecute the communists and not touch the social democrats. Therefore, until May 1933, the Social Democratic Party faction in the parliament always supported Hitler. Everyone knows what the outcome was: when Hitler did not need the social democrats, Hitler issued an order saying: "The Social Democratic Party should be regarded as a party hostile to the German people, and this party should be dealt with in the same way as the Communist Party." Hundreds of thousands of honest German social democrats were sent to forced labor and the guillotine after the communists.

Enlightened people in the French Socialist Party today recall this historical lesson. For example, Daniel Mayer, former Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, said on September 18: "People start by banning the Communist Party. But I dare say that the dissolution of the Communist Party is the prelude to the dissolution of other parties, such as the Socialist Party."

As for Mollet and his supporters (who spare no effort to keep their seats as servants in the general's chariot), they have long been unworthy of calling themselves socialists. Everyone knows, for example, that it was Mollet, as the then prime minister, who should be held responsible for launching the criminal Suez adventure against the Arab people. Everyone knows that Mollet established a hotbed for fascist conspirators in Algeria. Everyone also knows that it was Mollet who played a particularly indecent role in the days of May, clearing the way for the reactionary forces.

    Democratic and Progressive Forces Are Tempered in Struggle

Now, the French Socialist Party has split, and as a result, the Socialist Party members who broke with Mollet have established a new party under the banner of fighting against the reactionary forces. This situation is a symbol of the times. This proves once again that it is no longer 1933, and now the democratic and progressive forces are incomparably stronger and have been tempered in struggle.

The French ruling group is trying to weaken and suppress the democratic forces in order to establish a brutal and reactionary political rule. However, in the current situation, this political policy can only sharpen the domestic struggle in France. As the smoke screen of enticing promises to maintain republican freedom begins to dissipate, this struggle will grow and strengthen.

    Healthy Forces in France Will Find a Way to Unite

The Soviet people frankly express their sympathy for the French working people, who are struggling tensely in complex circumstances to save their democratic freedoms, which they have long gained. The Soviet people believe that the heroic French working class, led by the battle-tested French Communist Party, is powerful. The aspirations of the French working class, the French working peasants, the middle class, and the advanced intellectuals who are loyal to the tradition of free thought and heroic resistance to tyranny, are dear and understandable to the Soviet people. There is no doubt that the healthy forces of contemporary France will find a way to consolidate and unite their ranks, so as to fight back against the attack of the reactionary forces.

The current international situation is also unfavorable to the conspiracy to revive fascism. The era when Hitler and Mussolini could arbitrarily change the systems of certain European countries is long gone. Now, the powerful camp of peace and democracy is having an increasing impact on the international situation, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for the reactionary forces to realize their plans, including the plan to establish a source of aggression and war in Europe.

    French Rulers Want to Rely on the Support of the West German Regime

In this situation, the attempt of French ruling figures to collude with West German militarists to find a common language and a common diplomatic policy is very noteworthy. It seems that these figures want to rely on the support of the West German regime, the most reactionary regime in Europe. In this way, they are preparing to sacrifice the fundamental national interests of France, because the establishment of an increasingly militarized country on the eastern border of France is a fatal threat to France. General De Gaulle himself has repeatedly and convincingly talked about this threat.

West German Chancellor Adenauer smelled the fascism in France and came to France to visit when preparations for the referendum were in full swing. He had a long face-to-face meeting with General De Gaulle. After this meeting, Adenauer happily said: "The General's views on the German issue have changed compared to the first few years after the war."

It is worth noting that in the communiqué of the meeting between Adenauer and De Gaulle, there was a vague statement: let "as many European countries as possible" join the "European family." The French Foreign Minister explained that this statement meant to also "attract" Eastern European countries. Thus, twenty years after Munich, someone is again trying to tie France to the German chariot and drag it eastward. However, only those who have lost all sense of reality would seriously expect to succeed in an adventure in Eastern Europe.

    French Authorities Intentionally Intensify Anti-Soviet Propaganda

It cannot but be noticed that recently, anti-Soviet propaganda has been intensified in Paris, which is carried out with the consent of the French authorities and is completely in line with the well-known American standards. West German and Hollywood anti-Soviet films have appeared on the screen, and despicable slanderous works have been placed in bookstore windows. Some newspapers have unanimously called the Soviet Union "the number one enemy"... What is all this for? Have the French authorities forgotten the limits?

The older generation in France still remembers this kind of collusion with German militarists on the eve of the Second World War. But what was the outcome of all this? The Soviet people had to shed blood and sacrifice to help France liberate itself from the shackles of those to whom its rulers bowed and scraped.

In France, someone is now clamoring that De Gaulle's meeting with Adenauer has forever ended Franco-German contradictions. This is a statement to divert attention. Only a democratic France and a democratic Germany can truly find a common language and find a way to peaceful cooperation. The friendship between the French reactionary group and the West German revanchists is not a path to peace, but a path to war.

Needless to say, this plan not only harms the national interests of France, but also violates the interests of the German people and the people of all European countries.

We hope that the reason inherent in the French nation will prevail.

    Soviet People Are Loyal Friends of the French People

As for the Soviet people, they have been and will remain loyal friends of the peace-loving French people, and sincerely hope that they can get rid of the difficult situation that France is currently suffering. The Soviet people hope that France will occupy its rightful place as a great democratic country on the international stage, and pursue its own independent policy to consolidate peace and strengthen international cooperation.

    赫鲁晓夫纵论法国局势
    法国面临法西斯的威胁
    戴高乐的“公民投票”是要使政变合法化
    新华社22日讯　塔斯社莫斯科22日讯：“真理报”编辑部收到许多读者来信，要求阐明法国局势的实质。许多读者最近还提出这样一个问题：对戴高乐同阿登纳的会谈应该作怎样的估计？
    “真理报”编辑部请尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志就这些问题发表意见。今天，“真理报”刊载了赫鲁晓夫同志的答复。全文如下：
    法国的局势不能不引起苏联人的关心。历史经验证明，这个西方国家的命运同整个欧洲的命运是十分密切地联系着的。二十年前，同希特勒进行的可耻的慕尼黑勾结为第二次世界大战打开了大门。二十年后的今天，法国反动派要走那条老路的阴谋活动自然引起了一切珍视和平事业的人的密切注意。因此，苏联人民一方面完全遵守自己的绝不干涉别国内政的原则性立场，另方面警惕地注视着同欧洲安全问题有最直接关系的法国局势的发展，这是很自然的。
    “真理报”读者在信中对阿尔及利亚法西斯分子五月的叛乱之后法国的局势如何转变表示关心，这是完全对的。
    某些人对戴高乐的幻想破灭了
    三、四个月以前，欧洲还有人以这样一种希望来宽慰自己，即希望戴高乐将军领导的新政府会愿意而且能够约束法西斯叛乱分子，结束对阿尔及利亚人民的不正义的殖民主义战争，并且在法国维护共和体制。不错，进步力量当时就曾经警告过这一切希望只不过是空虚的有害的幻想，阿尔及利亚事件同巴黎新政府的执政，这两者之间有着最直接的因果关系。
    现实生活很快就使这些幻想破灭了。就在7月14日法国国庆日这一天，参加叛乱的将军和校官们获得了勋章和提升。从阿尔及利亚乘飞机前来参加军事检阅的伞兵以胜利者的姿态出现在巴黎，就如同走在被征服的城市中一样。在那些心地善良而误入迷途的人中间，有许多人看到这种情形之后，开始怀疑起来了。现在，当人们开始展开狂热的活动来制定赋予政府首脑以无所不包的独裁权力的新宪法的时候，新政府抱有所谓救国使命的虚伪性就可以看得更加清楚了。
    目前，在就新宪法草案举行公民投票的前夕，有人在加倍努力想给正在法国策划的政变造成合法的假象。这样做是为了便于那些在5月13日在阿尔及利亚发出叛乱信号的人实现有深远打算的计划。
    西欧反动势力力图恢复法西斯
    不能把法国的事态同西欧整个局势隔绝开来看。在整个战后时期，在第二次世界大战中（当时粉碎了德国和意大利的法西斯主义）受到摧毁的帝国主义反动势力顽固地力图巩固它们的动摇了的阵地。在这十三年当中，它们不止一次地企图在新的形式下，在新的招牌下恢复法西斯主义。
    在西欧，时而在这个国家，时而在那个国家，统治集团从调和的、议会方法的策略转向公开独裁和粗暴镇压民主力量的策略。这种企图到处遭到人民的坚决反对，人民由于同希特勒法西斯进行斗争的经验而变得聪明了。但是在个别地方，反动势力取得了暂时的胜利，西德就是这样，军国主义者在那里取缔了进步组织的活动。现在，同样的策略路线也在法国形成着。
    新宪法使议会的作用化为乌有
    作为新宪法基础的建立个人独裁的计划，使议会的作用化为乌有；实行最严酷的警察迫害制度，在有些地方，例如在阿尔及利亚，甚至实行希特勒式的恐怖；让军事首脑在国家机构中窃据发号施令的地位；连资产阶级民主所给予的那些自由也逐渐被取消；工人阶级的社会果实有被剥夺的危险，工人阶级的民主组织遭到进攻——所有这一切不禁使人想起1933年在德国的局势。因此今天可以完全有根据地说，法国面临着法西斯的威胁。
    法国垄断资本现在把亡命之徒放到国家政治生活舞台的前台，这不是偶然的。这些亡命之徒同1932—1933年在德国横行一时的流氓简直像孪生兄弟一样。从前的间谍苏斯戴尔、阿尔及利亚的讨伐者马絮将军、为希特勒效过劳的维希分子德塞里尼、卖国贼贝当政府的前外交部长乔治·庞纳之流，这些就是目前法国统治集团中的决策人，他们在为建立个人独裁政权的新宪法而努力。
    法西斯的威胁从阿尔及利亚（法国殖民主义者在那里企图扼杀阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放运动）开始扩展到法国，这也不是偶然的。法国社会党的一位创始人儒勒·盖德写道：“殖民主义战争往往是国内战争的学校。在阿尔及利亚反对阿拉伯人和卡比尔人的战争中培养出了像卡芬雅克这样的屠夫。”盖德所指的是卡芬雅克将军，他在1848年6月组织了对巴黎工人的野蛮屠杀。他接着回忆说，屠杀巴黎公社的刽子手也是在殖民主义的远征中培养出来的。现在，想做现代的卡芬雅克的马絮将军也是在阿尔及利亚殖民主义战争中训练出来的，他厚颜无耻地说，在新宪法通过之后，法国的进步势力将“处于非法地位”，他并且威胁说，“将根据正式的法令加以处决。”
    法国统治集团抛弃资产阶级民主
    法国统治集团抛弃资产阶级民主，转而采用公开暴力的方法，这证明他们日益软弱。法国统治集团中最狡猾的政客们由于想到希特勒的下场，便企图用下列虚伪的言词来冲淡马絮将军所泄露的话，他们说什么新宪法可以保证维护共和制度和保证遵守法制。同时还采用了笼络人心的煽动性宣传。希特勒当年曾经竭力用所谓“民族社会主义”的说法来收买德国工人阶级。苏斯戴尔之流正在寻找他们自己的欺骗群众的方法。因此，在法国目前有人打着爱国主义的旗帜空前地进行沙文主义的煽动，这不是偶然的。与此同时，他们又向劳动人民提出一种新的、美国所制造的“人民资本主义”理论，企图使他们相信，在完整地保存私有制和剥削制度的情况下也可以“消灭雇佣劳动”……。
    法国人民积极反对新宪法草案
    法国反动派企图打着合法的旗帜，利用戴高乐将军的威望，来建立法西斯制度。但是，在这方面，他们也不是独出心裁的：鲁尔的“钢铁大王”们也正是这样做的，那时他们利用国会和在本国也享有一定威望的、当时的总统兴登堡将军来把全部政权让给法西斯分子。
    同法西斯主义作过残酷斗争的许多法国人是了解这一点的。在筹备即将举行的公民投票过程中，法国人民的广大阶层人士越来越积极地反对新宪法草案，这不是偶然的。他们认为，正像最近一位法国社会活动家所说的，公民投票是使“政变合法化”。
    法国社会党领导者走上可耻道路
    在这种情况下，法国社会党领导机构、特别是它的总书记摩勒的立场便更加显得不体面。他走上了德国社会民主党右翼领袖的可耻道路，德国社会民主党在1933年希特勒夺取了政权的那些可悲的日子里分裂了德国工人阶级。这些领袖拒绝同共产党人组成统一战线，他们鼠目寸光地指望，希特勒只会迫害共产党人，而不会触动社会民主党人。因此，直到1933年5月，国会社会民主党党团始终支持希特勒。结局怎么样，是大家都知道的：当希特勒不需要社会民主党人的时候，希特勒就发布了一个命令，命令说：“应当认为社会民主党是一个敌视德国人民的党，应当用对付共产党的手段来对付这个党。”成千上万的正直的德国社会民主党人继共产党人之后被送去做苦役，被送上断头台。
    法国社会党头脑清醒的人士今天都回想起这个历史教训。例如，社会党前总书记丹尼埃·麦耶9月18日说：“人们从禁止共产党开始。但是，我敢断言，解散共产党是解散其他政党例如社会党的序幕。”
    至于摩勒和他的拥护者（他们不惜以任何代价来保住将军马车的仆从座位），他们早已无权自称为社会党人了。大家知道，例如，正是摩勒，作为当时的总理，他应当对发动反对阿拉伯人民的、罪恶的苏伊士冒险事件负责。大家知道，摩勒在阿尔及利亚建立了法西斯阴谋家的温床。大家也都知道，正是摩勒在5月的日子里担当了特别不体面的、为反动势力扫清道路的角色。
    民主进步力量在斗争中受到锻炼
    现在，法国社会党发生了分裂，结果，同摩勒决裂的社会党人士在为反对反动势力而斗争的旗帜下成立一个新党。这种情况是时代的象征。这又一次证明，现在已经不是1933年了，现在民主和进步力量无比地壮大了，并且在斗争中受到了锻炼。
    法国统治集团为了建立残酷的反动的政治统治，力图削弱和镇压民主力量。但是，在目前情况下，这种政治方针只能使法国国内的斗争更加尖锐化。随着笼络人心的、所谓维护共和自由的诺言的烟幕开始消失，这一斗争将日益壮大和加强。
    法国健康力量必将找到团结途径
    苏联人民坦率地表示他们对法国劳动人民的同情，法国劳动人民正在复杂的情况下为拯救他们长期以来取得的民主自由而紧张地斗争。苏联人民相信，在久经战斗考验的法国共产党领导下的英勇的法国工人阶级是有力量的。法国工人阶级、法国劳动农民、中间阶层以及忠于自由思想传统和英勇反抗暴政的先进知识分子的愿望，对苏联人是亲切的和可以理解的。毫无疑问，当代法国的健康力量必将找到巩固和团结自己队伍的途径，从而给予反动派的进攻以回击。
    当前国际局势对复活法西斯主义的阴谋也是不利的。希特勒和墨索里尼随心所欲地更改某些欧洲国家的制度的时代早就一去不复返了。现在，强大的和平民主阵营正对国际局势发生越来越大的影响，反动势力越来越难于实现它的计划，其中包括在欧洲建立侵略和战争策源地的计划。
    法国统治者想依赖西德政权支持
    在这种情况下，法国统治人物想勾结西德军国主义者寻找共同语言和共同外交政策方针的企图就很引人注意。看来，这些人物想依靠像西德政权这样一个欧洲最反动的政权的支持。这样，他们就准备牺牲法国的根本民族利益，因为在法国东部边境建立一个日益加剧的军国主义化的国家是对法国的致命威胁。戴高乐将军当年就曾经多次地令人信服地谈过这个威胁。
    德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳闻到了法国的法西斯主义气味，便在公民投票的准备工作搞得热火朝天的时候来到法国访问。他同戴高乐将军面对面地进行了长时间的会谈。在这次会晤以后，阿登纳高兴地说：“将军对德国问题的观点，同战后最初几年相比已经有了改变。”
    值得注意的是，在阿登纳和戴高乐的会谈公报中出现了含糊其词的提法：让“尽可能多的欧洲国家”加入“欧洲大家庭”。法国外交部长解释说，这种提法的意思是也要“吸引”东欧国家。这样，在慕尼黑以后二十年，又有人企图把法国绑在德国的战车上，并拖着它向东进军。但是，只有丧失了一切现实感的人，才会当真地指望在东欧的冒险能获得成功。
    法国当局有意加紧鼓吹反苏宣传
    还不能不注意到这样一种情况：近来，在巴黎加紧鼓吹反苏宣传，这种宣传是在法国当局的同意下进行的，并且同人所共知的美国标准完全一致。银幕上出现了西德和好莱坞的反苏影片，书店的橱窗里摆出了卑鄙的诽谤性的著作。有些报纸齐声一致地称苏联为“头号敌人”……这一切都是为了什么呢？法国当局是否忘记了事情的分寸？
    法国老一代的人还记得在第二次世界大战前夜同德国军国主义者玩弄的这种勾当。但是这一切的结局是如何的呢？苏联人民不得不流血牺牲，去帮助法国从它的统治者对之卑躬屈膝的那些人的枷锁下解放出来。
    在法国现在有人大叫大嚷，说戴高乐同阿登纳的会晤永远结束了法德矛盾。这是转移视线的说法。只有民主的法国和民主的德国才能真正找到共同语言，找到和平合作的途径。法国反动集团和西德复仇主义者的交情不是和平的途径，而是战争的途径。
    不用说，这种计划既损害法国的民族利益，也违背德国人民和欧洲各国人民的利益。
    我们希望，法兰西民族所固有的理智必占上风。
    苏联人民是法国人民忠实朋友
    至于苏联人民，他们过去是、将来仍然是爱好和平的法国人民的忠实朋友，并且真诚地希望他们能摆脱法国目前所遭受的困难处境。苏联人民希望法国在国际舞台上占有它应有的、伟大民主国家的地位，奉行自己的独立政策，以巩固和平和加强国际合作。
