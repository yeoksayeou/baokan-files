　　Good News for Travelers

　　Hebei Province has newly opened five long-distance bus routes: Handan – Fengfeng; Shijiazhuang – Gangnan; Baoding – Gaoyang; Zhangjiakou – Xuanhua; Zhangjiakou – Zhangbei. These routes sell tickets by segments, are not restricted by fixed passenger numbers, and allow passengers to get on and off at will. (Meng Weiyao)

　　The Baiquan County Transportation Bureau and the railway station in Heilongjiang Province have implemented joint transportation. The bus station sells train tickets on behalf of the railway station, and the railway station sells bus tickets on behalf of the bus station. The departure and arrival times of buses have also been adjusted to connect with the train departure and arrival times as much as possible, greatly facilitating passenger transfers.
