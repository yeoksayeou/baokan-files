　　Bottom Left Picture: Eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene embodies the great role of changing customs and breaking superstitions. This old lady has come to realize that worshipping ghosts and gods cannot eliminate disease; only by eradicating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene can one be physically and mentally healthy. From then on, the old lady no longer burns incense and prays to the gods, she found a new use for the incense burner.
