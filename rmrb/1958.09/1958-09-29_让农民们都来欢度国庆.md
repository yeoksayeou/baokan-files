Let the Peasants Celebrate National Day

　　The annual National Day is approaching! These days, rural areas across the country are actively preparing, not only planning to hold mass rallies, parades and other celebrations, but also to conduct dinners, performances, film screenings or other cultural and recreational activities, to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the founding of our People’s Republic in a lively and joyful atmosphere.

　　This year, all undertakings in our country have made all-round great leaps forward, which is indeed worthy of celebration by the whole nation. For the 500 million peasants, what is particularly worth celebrating is that this year's harvest is an unprecedented bumper harvest. Over the past year, the peasants have gone all out and worked hard, and have already obtained fruitful results. This year, China's grain, cotton and other major agricultural products will increase by more than double compared to last year. China's total wheat production has exceeded that of the United States, which is known as the "wheat kingdom" of the world. The yield per mu of rice in China has also exceeded that of Japan, a world-renowned country with high rice yields. China's cotton achievements are even more outstanding, with both unit area yield and total output exceeding all capitalist countries in the world. Under the leadership of the Party, Chinese peasants, although they have not realized agricultural mechanization, have been able to develop agricultural production at a high speed in a very short period of time, catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in the world, creating an unprecedented miracle. Due to this year's unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production, China's food problem has been basically solved, and the basic solution to the clothing problem is not far away. The life of adequate food and clothing that the peasants have dreamed of for generations will soon be realized!

　　This year's amazing and great achievements in agriculture are inseparable from the founding of the People's Republic. Only in a country led by the Communist Party can peasants get rid of suffering and poverty, give full play to their creativity, and build a happy life of universal prosperity. On this National Day, when a bumper harvest is in sight, all rural areas across the country should celebrate greatly, so that everyone is in a good mood and every family is full of joy.

　　This year's National Day celebration in rural areas should further boost the enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants and strive for a greater leap forward and bumper harvest next year. When celebrating National Day and the bumper harvest, rural areas across the country should conduct extensive publicity through various celebration activities. It is necessary to publicize the country's increasing prosperity and strength, so as to strengthen the patriotic and collectivist ideas of the vast number of peasants; publicize the achievements and significance of the agricultural bumper harvest, so that the vast number of peasants will be more motivated to work hard in production and strive for a greater leap forward and bumper harvest in agriculture next year; it is also necessary to publicize the whole people's running of industry and education, the combination of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and the combination of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers; publicize the superiority of the People's Commune, so as to promote the comprehensive development of the rural economy and the consolidation and improvement of the People's Commune. At the same time, various localities can also organize visits to large-scale high-yield fields, and visits to excellent achievements such as community-run industries and community-run schools, exchange experiences, and commend advanced units and model members, according to the specific situation. Through these publicity, visits, and commendations, a new upsurge of leap forward should be set off in rural areas.

　　In view of the fact that the current production tasks are still very heavy, the steel production on the industrial front is in a tense stage, and the autumn harvest and autumn planting work in agriculture has already begun, the celebration activities should be joyful, jubilant and encouraging on the one hand, and simple and unadorned on the other hand, and the time should not be too long, so as not to delay production. At the same time, whether it is public dinners or family dinners, attention should be paid to appropriate restraint, and not too much slaughtering.

　　Celebrating the National Day and the bumper harvest is a matter that concerns the broad masses of people, and it is a matter that everyone cares about and everyone has a share in. When preparing for the celebration activities, party organizations at all levels should seriously discuss with the masses to ensure that everyone has a happy holiday and a good time.

### 让农民们都来欢度国庆

    让农民们都来欢度国庆
    一年一度的国庆节快要到来了！这些天来，全国各地农村都在积极筹备，不仅准备举行群众大会、游行等庆祝活动，还要进行聚餐、演戏、放映电影或其他文化娱乐活动，要热热闹闹、高高兴兴地度过我们人民共和国成立的九周年纪念日。
    今年我国各项事业全面大跃进，的确值得全民欢庆。对于五亿农民来说，特别值得庆祝的是今年的年成是空前未有的大丰收。农民们一年来鼓足干劲，辛勤劳动，已经获得了丰硕的果实。我国今年粮食、棉花等主要农产品都将比去年增产一倍以上。我国小麦的总产量已经超过了号称世界“小麦王国”的美国，我国水稻的亩产量也已超过了世界有名的水稻高产国家日本，我国棉花的成绩更突出，单位面积产量和总产量都超过世界上一切资本主义国家。我国农民在党的领导下，虽然没有实现农业机械化，但也能够在很短的时间内高速度地发展农业生产，赶上和超过世界上最发达的资本主义国家，创造了史无前例的奇迹。由于今年农业生产的空前大丰收，我国的吃饭问题基本上已经解决了，穿衣问题的基本解决也不是很遥远的事情了。农民们世世代代梦寐以求的丰衣足食的生活，很快就可以实现了！
    今年农业获得这样惊人的伟大成就，是同人民共和国的创立分不开的。只有在共产党领导的国家里，农民才有可能摆脱痛苦和贫困，才能最充分地发挥自己的创造力，才能建设普遍富裕的幸福的生活。在这国庆到来、丰收在望的日子里，全国所有农村应该大大庆祝一番，让人人心情舒畅，家家欢天喜地。
    今年农村中庆祝国庆，应该进一步鼓足广大农民的干劲，争取明年的更大的跃进和丰收。全国各地农村在庆祝国庆、庆祝大丰收的时候，应该通过各种庆祝活动，广泛地进行宣传。要宣传我们国家的日益兴旺和强盛，以加强广大农民的爱国主义和集体主义的观念；宣传农业大丰收的成就和意义，使广大农民更加鼓足干劲努力生产，争取明年农业更大的跃进和丰收；还要宣传全民办工业、办教育，宣传农、林、牧、副、渔相结合和工农商学兵相结合；宣传人民公社的优越性，以促进农村经济的全面发展和人民公社的巩固和提高。同时，各地还可以根据情况，就地组织大面积丰产田的参观，和社办工业、社办学校等优良成绩的参观，交流经验，表扬先进单位和模范社员。应当通过这些宣传、参观、表扬，在农村中掀起一个新的跃进高潮。
    鉴于当前的生产任务仍很繁重，工业战线上钢铁生产正处在紧张阶段，农业方面的秋收秋种工作又已开始，庆祝活动一方面要兴高彩烈、欢欣鼓舞，另一方面也要简单朴素，时间不要过长，以免耽误生产。同时，不论公共聚餐或家庭聚餐也要注意有适当的节制，不要宰杀过多。
    国庆庆丰收是关系广大群众的事情，是人人关心、个个有份的事情。各级党组织在筹备庆祝活动的时候，应该同群众认真商量，务使大家过节过得快乐，玩得高兴。
