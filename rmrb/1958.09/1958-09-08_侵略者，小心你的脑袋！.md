　　Invaders, Watch Out For Your Heads!
　　Cao Yu
　　The 650 million Chinese people warmly support Premier Zhou's solemn statement. People all over the country are extremely angry about the US military provocations. Everyone says: In order to liberate Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, Jinmen and Mazu, whatever the motherland needs, we will support it; wherever it wants us to go, we will go. All the Chinese people will immediately mobilize all their strength to resolutely defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity.
　　Today, the whole world praises the peaceful construction achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. We are proudly engaged in the socialist cause of one day equaling twenty years, moving mountains and overturning seas, and leaping forward. At this time, the American aggressors are dispatching a large number of warships and aircraft, openly using warships and artillery fire to blockade our coastal islands and the Jinmen Islands,妄想trying to impose war on us.
　　Well then, the entire Chinese people are ready to give Dulles and Eisenhower a resounding slap in the face!
　　We have repeatedly stated that liberating Taiwan is an unshakeable determination of the Chinese people. There cannot be two suns in the sky, nor can there be two Chinas on earth. The Chinese people are determined to liberate all of China's sacred territory. For several years, the United States has forcibly occupied Taiwan, used the Chiang Kai-shek group that has long been abandoned by the Chinese people, interfered in our internal affairs, and created tensions in the Taiwan Strait. This is absolutely intolerable.
　　Dulles has issued several delirious statements in a row, threatening China. This once again proves the despicable and tyrannical nature of this notorious warmonger. The US Congress has also presumptuously authorized Eisenhower to use armed forces to prevent us from liberating Jinmen and Mazu. This is truly heinous, and it can only show that the US Congress is nothing more than a den of bandits.
　　The bellicose American aggressors are most astonishing in two aspects: one is their "thick skin" and the other is their "stupid brains." Saying they have a "thick skin" is like when US imperialism sent troops to invade Lebanon, it was clearly to suppress the just revolution of the Lebanese people, but it insisted on calling its invasion a move against invasion. Taiwan and other places are Chinese territory, which the United States has admitted, but it occupied Taiwan, and today it attempts to occupy Jinmen and Mazu, and like a robber, it denies China's sovereignty over these territories, and instead says that our liberation of these islands is "using armed forces to seize new territory." This kind of sophistry and pretense of seriousness has long been foul-smelling and ignored by everyone.
　　Saying they have "stupid brains" refers to their ignorance and aggressiveness. In fact, the US imperialist army has always been a defeated army in our hands. It has invaded repeatedly and suffered miserable defeats repeatedly. From 1946, on the Chinese mainland, we punched it so hard that it and the Chiang gang's army fell into the sea and fled. After 1950, on the Korean battlefield, they were beaten to a rout by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. It seems that their "stupid brains" problem has not changed, and they openly think of provoking us on the coast again. But today our fists are much stronger than before. If it dares to launch a war, the Chinese people will surely eliminate it in the waves of the Taiwan Strait. Just as the "Soviet Russia News" said, this time the US imperialist adventure will not be a matter of "losing a hand," but a matter of "losing its head."
　　Our just struggle has already won the unanimous and strong support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and peoples who oppose aggression. This is a force tens of millions of times stronger than those weak US missile nuclear weapons, because this is the power of justice and peace, which is irresistible. A few days ago, US imperialism was still secretly studying "surrender studies," calculating how the United States, which was "far behind in missiles," could find the most appropriate time to surrender in a war. Now this bellicose paper tiger is showing its teeth and claws to scare people again.
　　This repeatedly errant, thoroughly rotten US imperialism is full of contradictions. Now this seemingly fierce aggressor is hypocritically trying to sit down and negotiate.
　　The Chinese people, who have been tempered by long-term revolution, cannot be intimidated or deceived. Our government has always advocated using peaceful means to resolve some international disputes. Meeting at the table is naturally better than meeting on the battlefield. However, there is one thing that the American imperialists must remember: no matter how cunning you are, there are only two roads in front of you: one is to respect China's sovereignty and honestly get out. This road is good for you and can save your heads. The other way is to insist on armed interference in China's internal affairs, which for you will only lead to a shameful defeat and destruction. The Chinese people will rise up in self-defense and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate the American aggressors.
　　No matter which way US imperialism goes, we must force it to wake up and recognize that the just power of the strong Chinese people cannot be insulted. The result of both roads is the same: they must be handled in accordance with the will and determination of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and all our sacred territory.
　　Victory will surely belong to us, and failure will surely belong to this group of vicious and tyrannical aggressors!

### 侵略者，小心你的脑袋！

　　侵略者，小心你的脑袋！
    曹禺
    六亿五千万中国人民，热烈地拥护周总理的严正声明。全国各地的人民对美国的军事挑衅愤怒极了，大家一致说：为了解放台湾、澎湖列岛、金门和马祖，祖国要甚么，就支援甚么，要我们到哪里，我们就到哪里。全中国人民立刻动员一切力量，坚决保卫我们的主权和领土完整。
    今天，全世界都齐声赞美在中国共产党的领导下的中国人民的和平建设成就。我们正豪迈地干着一天等于二十年、移山倒海、飞跃前进的社会主义事业。这时，美国侵略者却调派大批军舰飞机，公然要用军舰炮火来封锁我们的沿海岛屿和金门岛群，妄想把战争加在我们头上。
    好吧，全中国人民准备给杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔一个响响亮亮的耳光！
    我们屡次声明，解放台湾是中国人民不可动摇的决心。天无二日，地上没有第二个中国，凡是中国的神圣的领土，中国人民是坚决要解放的。几年来，美国强占台湾，利用早被中国人民唾弃的蒋介石集团，干涉我们的内政，制造台湾海峡的紧张局势。这是决不能容忍的。
    杜勒斯一连发了几次呓症一般的声明，威胁中国，这再一次证明了这个臭名昭著的好战分子的卑鄙和强横。美国国会又煞有介事地授权艾森豪威尔，用武装力量阻挠我们解放金门和马祖，真是穷凶极恶，只能说明美国国会不过是一个强盗窝而已。
    好战的美国侵略者，有两点最是惊人：一是“脸皮厚”，二是“头脑蠢”。说它“脸皮厚”，譬如美帝国主义出兵侵略黎巴嫩，明明是为了镇压黎巴嫩人民的正义的革命，偏把它的侵略说成是为了反对侵略。台湾等地是中国的领土，美国是承认过的，但它侵占了台湾，今天又企图侵占金门和马祖，又强盗一般地否认中国对这些领土的主权，反说我们解放这些岛屿，是“用武装力量夺取新的领土”，这种强词夺理，死装正经的手段，早已是臭不可闻，无人理睬。
    说它“头脑蠢”，是指它愚顽无知，侵略成性。其实美帝国主义的军队一直是我们手下的败卒。它屡次侵略，屡次惨败。1946年起，在中国大陆上被我们一拳打得它和蒋帮军队落海而逃。1950年后，又在朝鲜战场上，被中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，打得溃不成军。看来，现在它的“头脑蠢”的毛病仍然未改，公然又想到我们沿海挑衅了。但今天我们的拳头比从前又结实得多。它胆敢发动战争，中国人民必然把它消灭在台湾海峡的浪涛里。这正如“苏维埃俄罗斯报”说，这次美帝国主义的冒险，对它自己来说，将不是“丧失手”，而是“丧失脑袋”的问题了。
    我们的正义斗争，早已获得了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平反对侵略的国家与广大人民的一致的有力支持。这是远比美国那几颗软巴巴的导弹核武器，具有千万倍强大的力量，因为这是正义与和平的力量，是无可抵挡的。前两天，美帝国主义还在偷偷地研究“投降学”，算计“导弹大大落后了”的美国，如何在大战中找到一个投降的最恰当的时机。现在这个好战的纸老虎，又张牙舞爪地来吓唬人了。
    这个屡犯错误，腐烂透顶的美帝国主义，真是百般矛盾，如今这个貌似凶狠的侵略者，又假惺惺地想坐下来谈判一下。
    久经革命锻炼的中国人民，是吓不倒也骗不了的。我们的政府，一直主张用和平方式来解决国际一些争端，在桌上见面，自然比在战场上见面好。然而有一点美帝国主义者要记住，无论你怎样狡猾，摆在你面前的，只有两条路：一条是尊重中国的主权，老老实实地滚出去。这条路对你们有好处，可以保全自己的脑袋。另一条路是：硬要武装干涉中国的内政，对你们说来就只有可耻的惨败和毁灭。中国人民将奋起自卫，坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭美国侵略者。
    无论美帝国主义走哪条路，我们要迫使它清醒过来，要它认清强大的中国人民的正义力量是不可侮的。两条路的结果是一样的，都必须按照中国人民的意志和决心办事，解放台湾和一切属于我们的神圣领土。
    胜利必然属于我们，失败的必是这群凶恶强横的侵略者！
