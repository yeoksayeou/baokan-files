    Request for Coverage of Fisheries and Salt Production
    Since the beginning of this year, People's Daily has devoted a lot of space to reporting on the Great Leap Forward on various production fronts, which is very good. What I think is insufficient is that there is too little coverage of fisheries and salt production.
    Our country has many fishermen and salt workers. Under the glorious illumination of the General Line, fisheries and salt production have also ushered in a production Great Leap Forward unprecedented in history. On the fisheries and salt production front, there have also been many touching deeds. Newspapers and periodicals should devote some space to appropriately reporting all of this.

    要求报道渔业和盐业
    今年以来人民日报用了很多篇幅报道各个生产战线上大跃进的情况，这是很好的。我觉得不够的地方是有关渔业、盐业生产方面的报道太少了。
    我国有很多渔民、盐民。在总路线的光辉照耀下，渔、盐业生产也掀起了有史以来未曾见到的生产大跃进高潮。在渔、盐业的生产战线上，也出现了不少感人的事迹。这一切，报刊是应该拿出一些篇幅适当报道的。
