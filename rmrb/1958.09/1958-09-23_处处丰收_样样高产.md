Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 22nd: According to statistics from Fujian Province, the total output of early rice in the province's 8,620,000 mu reached 4.31 billion jin, an increase of 2.043 billion jin compared to last year's early rice total output. This year's average yield of early rice was 500 jin per mu, 182 jin higher than last year's average yield of 318 jin per mu.

The vast number of farmers who have achieved a bumper harvest of early rice are enthusiastically handing over public grain and selling surplus grain, providing the best new grain to the state to support the front lines. At the same time, they are vigorously attacking the field management of late rice, striving to produce more grain to support the struggle to liberate the enemy-occupied islands along the coast of Fujian and liberate Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency: Following the bumper harvest of early rice, the Yangzhou area of Jiangsu Province has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of mid-season rice. 860,000 mu of mid-season indica rice in the area has been harvested and threshed, with an average yield of 1,554 jin per mu. Another 2,320,000 mu is being harvested, and it is estimated that the average yield of more than 3,000,000 mu of mid-season rice in the area will reach more than 1,500 jin per mu, an increase of 3.5 times compared to last year's mid-season rice yield per mu.

Xinhua News Agency: Another mid-season rice thousand-jin area has emerged in Hunan Province: the Hengyang area. (Note: Another mid-season rice thousand-jin area in Hunan is the Changde area, with an average yield of 1,001 jin per mu for its 3,820,000 mu of mid-season rice.) All of the 3,160,000 mu of mid-season rice in this area has been harvested, with an average yield of 1,018 jin per mu, an increase of more than 1.7 times compared to last year's average mid-season rice yield of 373 jin.

Xinhua News Agency: A mid-season rice thousand-jin area has emerged in the western mountainous area of Hunan Province: the Qianyang area. All of the 2,946,000 mu of mid-season rice in this area has been harvested, with a total output of 3,155.2 million jin, an average yield of more than 1,069 jin per mu, while last year's average mid-season rice yield was only 428 jin. Among the 12 counties in the area, Xupu, Chenxi, and Mayang counties have yields of more than 1,200 jin per mu, and Huitong, Yuanling, Huaihua, Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County, Tongdao Dong Autonomous County, and Zhijiang have yields of 1,000 to 1,200 jin per mu.

Xinhua News Agency: Dancheng County, Henan Province, which successfully converted to rice cultivation for the first time, has become an early rice 5,000-jin county. All of the 68,000 mu of early rice planted in this county have been harvested, with a total output of 374 million jin, an average yield of 5,500 jin per mu. Among them, there are two 10,000-jin townships. More than 2,400 mu of land yielded more than 20,000 jin per mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 21st: In Xia邑 County, Henan Province, the total output of more than 49,000 mu of early rice in the county reached 240,036,033.6 jin, with an average yield of 4,812 jin per mu, and 6,129 mu of "satellite" fields yielding between 10,000 and 25,000 jin have emerged. The 73,000 mu of corn yielded more than 2,500 jin per mu, an increase of more than 17 times compared to last year. The yield per unit area of 121,000 mu of millet jumped from 203 jin last year to 2,362 jin. Sorghum, which has always been considered a low-yield crop, has also jumped into the ranks of high-yield crops this year, with 116,000 mu of sorghum yielding more than 890 jin per mu, an increase of more than seven times compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency: This year, the 286,000 mu of grain crops in the Mulei Kazak Autonomous County of Xinjiang have achieved the highest large-scale bumper harvest in history. Among them, 181,800 mu of winter and spring wheat is about to be harvested, with a yield of 530 jin per mu. If we add the estimated output of miscellaneous grains and autumn grains that are about to mature, the average yield of grain crops in the county can reach 511 jin per mu, with a total output of more than 146,700,000 jin, exceeding the total grain output of the previous five years.

Xinhua News Agency: The Hongri People's Commune in Huanjiang County, Guangxi, located in a remote mountainous area, has achieved a large-scale high-yield bumper harvest of mid-season rice. As of the 8th, the commune had harvested a total of 969.89 mu of mid-season rice, with an actual harvest of more than 16,518,522 jin of rice. The average yield per mu was more than 17,031 jin of dry grain, an increase of more than 63 times compared to their mid-season rice yield of 270 jin per mu last year.
