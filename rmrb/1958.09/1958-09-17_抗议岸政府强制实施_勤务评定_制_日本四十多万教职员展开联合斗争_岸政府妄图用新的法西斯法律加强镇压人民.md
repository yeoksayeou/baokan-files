Xinhua News Agency, September 15th dispatch from Tokyo: More than 439,000 Japanese teachers and staff, with the support of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the All-Japan Federation of Student Autonomies, launched a large-scale joint struggle today in 2,500 locations across Japan against the "Performance Rating" system.

The "Performance Rating" system is a system by which the Japanese government "assesses" Japanese teachers and staff with the aim of controlling their political thinking. It is an important measure taken by the Nobusuke Kishi government to accelerate the restoration of militarist education.

In Tokyo, more than 34,000 teachers and staff took leave this afternoon and held protest rallies at six venues. Workers belonging to the Tokyo Metropolitan Federation of Trade Unions and the National Railway Workers' Union attended the venues to express their support for the teachers' and staff's struggle.

The various rallies adopted resolutions against the "Performance Rating" system. The resolution of the eastern district rally strongly condemned the "Performance Rating" system as a system that would enable Japanese teachers and staff to assist in the implementation of war policies, and that it would pave the way for Japan's militarization.

In the Tohoku region of Japan, 35,000 people participated in the protest rally. In the Kanto region, 150,000 people held rallies and demonstrations in 400 locations. In the Chubu region, more than 4,000 people held gatherings in 180 locations.

At the same time, approximately 200,000 students from 53 universities in Japan participated today in rallies against the "Performance Rating" system, organized by the Japan Teachers' Union, in 52 cities. This morning, they also held strikes and held student rallies on their respective campuses.

More than 6,000 students in Tokyo held a national student mobilization rally to smash the "Performance Rating" system at Shimizu Valley Park today. After the meeting, a demonstration was held.

Xinhua News Agency, September 16th dispatch from Tokyo: In order to revive Japanese militarism and intensify the suppression of the Japanese workers' movement and the Japanese people, the Nobusuke Kishi government is actively preparing to revise laws and formulate new fascist laws.

According to Kyodo News, in order to deal with the powerful struggle of the Japan Teachers' Union against the "Performance Rating" system and the upcoming autumn struggle of Japanese workers, the leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have been consulting with the National Police Agency to revise the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law," so that the Nobusuke Kishi government's police will have the power to arbitrarily arrest Japanese people under the pretext of "preventing and stopping crime," and can arbitrarily conduct "interrogations" of the Japanese people "according to their duties."

At the same time, the Nobusuke Kishi government is also preparing to submit a so-called "Anti-Espionage Bill" to the Japanese Diet in order to import nuclear weapons from the United States and suppress the Japanese people under the pretext of protecting diplomatic and national defense secrets. The Japanese people, who suffered greatly from this kind of "anti-espionage law" of Japanese militarism during the war of aggression against China, have already expressed strong opposition to this attempt by the Kishi government some time ago.

    抗议岸政府强制实施“勤务评定”制
    日本四十多万教职员展开联合斗争
    岸政府妄图用新的法西斯法律加强镇压人民
    据新华社15日讯　东京消息：四十三万九千多名日本教职员今天在日本工会总评议会和全日本学生自治会总联合会的支援下，在日本全国二千五百个地方开展了一次大规模的反对“勤务评定”制度的联合斗争。
    “勤务评定”制度是日本政府以控制日本教职员的政治思想为目的来对他们进行“考核”的制度。它是岸信介政府为了加紧恢复军国主义教育所采取的重要手段。
    在东京，三万四千多名教职员今天下午请假，分别在六个会场举行了抗议大会。属于东京都工会联合会和国铁工会的工人到会场上表示声援教职员的斗争。
    各个大会分别通过了反对“勤务评定”制度的决议。东部地区大会的决议强烈谴责“勤务评定”制度是使日本教职员协助执行战争政策的制度，它还为日本的军国主义化开辟道路。
    在日本东北地区，有三万五千人参加了抗议大会。关东地区，在四百个地方有十五万人举行了大会和示威游行。中部地区，在一百八十个地方四千多人举行了集会。
    同时，日本五十三个大学的大约二十万名学生，今天分别在五十二个城市中参加了由日本教职员工会主持的反对“勤务评定”制度的大会。他们在今天上午还举行罢课，并且分别在校内举行了学生大会。
    今天有六千多名东京学生在清水谷公园举行了日本全国学生粉碎“勤务评定”制度总动员大会。会后举行了示威游行。
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府为了复活日本军国主义和加紧镇压日本工人运动和日本人民，正在积极准备修改法律和制订新的法西斯法律。
    据共同社报道，为了对付日本教职员工会反对“勤务评定”制度的声势浩大的斗争和即将到来的日本工人的秋季斗争，执政的自由民主党的首脑们已经在同警察厅商量修改“警察官职务执行法”，以便岸信介政府的警察有权在“预防和制止犯罪”的借口下随意逮捕日本人民，并且可以“根据职权”对日本人民随意进行“讯问”。
    同时，岸信介政府还在准备向日本国会提出一项所谓“防谍法案”，以便从美国输入核武器和在保护外交机密和国防机密的借口下镇压日本人民。在侵华战争中曾经饱受日本军国主义这种“防谍法”之害的日本人民，在前些时候已经对岸信介政府的这一企图表示强烈反对。
