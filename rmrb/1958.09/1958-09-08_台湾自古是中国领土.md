　　Taiwan Has Been China's Territory Since Ancient Times
　　Taiwan has been our country's territory since ancient times. This is evidenced by over a thousand years of history. As early as the Qin and Han dynasties, there were legends about Taiwan, and the Book of the Later Han Dynasty already mentioned this place. The "Liuqiu Kingdom" recorded in the Book of Sui is Taiwan. In 607 AD, Zhu Kuan, a Yuqi Lieutenant under Emperor Yang of Sui, arrived in Taiwan, and the following year, he dispatched officials to be stationed in Taiwan. This was the first time Chinese officials arrived in Taiwan, dating back 1,350 years. Subsequently, during the Tang, Five Dynasties, and even the Song and Yuan dynasties, people from southern Fujian and other counties continued to cross the sea to settle in Taiwan. Therefore, to this day, with the exception of the Gaoshan ethnic group, Taiwan's language and customs are the same as those of the mainland.
　　The Yuan Dynasty established the Penghu Patrol Office (1360) to govern Penghu and Taiwan. Taiwan and Penghu officially became part of our country's territory, more than four hundred years earlier than the independence of the United States (1776).
　　During the reign of Emperor Wanli of the Ming Dynasty (1592-1597), due to Toyotomi Hideyoshi's repeated invasions of Korea and the coastal areas of China, the Ming court sent troops to garrison Taiwan and Penghu to defend against Japanese pirates. At this time, Taiwan had become our country's defense line.
　　In the 16th century, Portuguese sailors passed through the Taiwan Strait and harbored ambitions to seize Taiwan, but did not engage in development. In the early 17th century (1622), the Dutch invaded and occupied Penghu and seized part of Taiwan. In 1624, the Ming court sent General Yu Zigao to recover Penghu, and the Dutch were defeated, capturing the Dutch commander Governor Hans Putmans and others. However, the southern part of Taiwan was still occupied by the Dutch. Later, the Spanish also invaded northern Taiwan. In 1641, the Spanish were defeated by the Dutch, abandoned Keelung and other castles, and fled. This was the first time Taiwan fell into the hands of imperialism.
　　After the Manchus entered the customs, Zheng Chenggong was determined to resist the Qing court. In February 1661 (lunar calendar), he led 25,000 soldiers and generals to attack Taiwan. After several months of fierce fighting, he completely drove the Dutch colonists out of Taiwan, ending 38 years of foreign rule. After Zheng Chenggong recovered Taiwan, coastal people on the mainland who were willing to follow him in resisting the Qing court crossed the sea to Taiwan, leading to significant development in Taiwan thereafter. In 1683, Zheng Chenggong's grandson, Zheng Keshuang, surrendered to the Qing Dynasty, and Taiwan was incorporated into the Qing Dynasty's territory.
　　The Qing Dynasty ruled Taiwan for more than two hundred years. It was not until after the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu that the Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895) was signed, ceding Taiwan to Japan. This made Taiwan once again become a colony of imperialism, ruled by Japan for fifty years. The people of Taiwan were unwilling to be ruled by Japan and launched a heroic resistance against the Japanese occupation army. From 1897 to 1902, as many as 8,030 Taiwanese anti-Japanese patriots were arrested, of whom 3,473 were killed.
　　After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, all of our country's territories occupied by Japan returned to the embrace of the motherland. The Cairo Declaration signed by China, Britain, and the United States on December 1, 1943, announced: "The Three Great Allies are conducting this war to curb Japan and punish Japanese aggression. The Three Allies have no intention of seeking self-interest, nor do they intend to expand their territory. The purpose of the Three Allies is to deprive Japan of all islands it has seized or occupied in the Pacific since the beginning of World War I in 1914, and to return to China the territories stolen by Japan from the Chinese people, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands." On July 26, 1945, the Potsdam Proclamation, jointly issued by China, the United States, and Britain, stipulating in Article 8: "The terms of the Cairo Declaration must be implemented." In September 1945, Japan surrendered. On October 25 of the same year, our country accepted the surrender of Ando Rikichi, the commander of the Japanese Tenth Area Army and Governor-General of Taiwan. Since then, the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan finally returned to the motherland.
　　In August 1948, the U.S. State Department's White Paper "On Sino-American Relations" admitted that "Taiwan should be returned to China." On December 23, 1949, the U.S. State Department's "Policy Propaganda Instructions Regarding Taiwan" also admitted that "Taiwan is politically, geographically, and strategically part of China." On January 5, 1950, U.S. President Truman issued a statement saying that the United States "recognizes China's exercise of sovereignty over the island (Taiwan)." On February 9 of the same year, the U.S. State Department, in response to the House Foreign Affairs Committee's questions on the Taiwan issue, admitted that Taiwan had been "included within China as a province" since 1945.
　　Now, U.S. imperialism disregards historical facts, abandons international agreements and its own international obligations, and is invading our country's Taiwan, Penghu, and other coastal islands, interfering in China's internal affairs, and carrying out military provocations. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people are determined to liberate these islands and smash the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism. (End)

### 台湾自古是中国领土

　　台湾自古是中国领土
    台湾自古以来就是我国的领土。这是有千年以上的历史来作证的。远在秦汉时代就有关于台湾的传说，后汉书中已提到这个地方。隋书记载的“流求国”便是台湾。公元607年隋炀帝手下的一位羽骑尉朱宽到了台湾，次年便派遣官员进驻台湾。这是中国官吏第一次到达台湾，距现在已经有一千三百五十年了。此后，经过唐、五代以至宋元，一直不断有闽南等县人民过海到台湾定居下来，因此迄今，除高山族以外，台湾的语言和风俗习惯都是和大陆相同的。
    元朝在澎湖设立了巡检司（1360年），管辖澎湖和台湾，台湾和澎湖就正式成为我国领土的一部分，这比美国独立（1776年）还要早四百多年。
    明万历二十年至二十五年（1592—1597），由于日本丰臣秀吉屡次侵略朝鲜及中国沿海，明廷派兵汛守台湾澎湖，以防日寇。这时，台湾已成为我国的国防线。
    十六世纪葡萄牙人航海经过台湾海峡，对台湾这个宝岛心怀侵占野心，但未进行经营。至十七世纪初（1622年）荷兰人侵占了澎湖并窃据台湾的一部分。1624年明廷派总兵俞咨皋规复澎湖，荷兰人大败，俘虏了荷兰守将高文律等人。但台湾南部一部分仍为荷兰所占有。此后西班牙人也曾侵入台湾的北部，至1641年西班牙人被荷兰人打败，放弃基隆等城堡而逃。这是台湾第一次沦入帝国主义手中。
    满清入关以后，郑成功决心反抗清廷，于1661年旧历二月初率领将士二万五千登舰攻取台湾，经过几个月的奋战把荷兰殖民者完全赶出了台湾，结束了三十八年的外国统治。郑成功收复台湾后大陆上愿意追随他反抗清廷的沿海人民，相率渡海到台湾，使台湾在这以后有了很大的开发。1683年郑成功的孙子郑克塽降于清朝，台湾归入清朝版图。
    清朝统治台湾有二百多年。直到甲午中日战争以后，签订马关条约（1895），把台湾割让给日本。	这使台湾又一次沦为帝国主义的殖民地，被日本统治达五十年之久。台湾人民不甘受日本的统治，曾对日本占领军队进行了英勇的抵抗。自1897年至1902年，台湾抗日志士被捕者达八千零三十人，其中被杀害的三千四百七十三人。
    抗日战争胜利以后，所有为日本侵占的我国领土都重新回到祖国的怀抱。1943年12月1日中、英、美三国签署的开罗宣言宣布：“我三大盟国此次进行战争，在于制止日本及惩罚日本之侵略。三国决不为自身图利，亦无拓展领土之意。三国之宗旨在剥夺日本自1914年第一次世界大战开始以后在太平洋所夺得或占领之一切岛屿，在使日本所窃取于中国人民之领土，例如满洲、台湾、澎湖群岛等，归还中国”。1945年7月26日，中、美、英三国联合发表的促令日本投降的波茨坦公告第八款又规定：“开罗宣言之条件必将实施”。1945年9月日本投降，同年10月25日，我国接受了日本第十方面军司令官兼台湾总督安藤利吉的投降，自此，台湾的领土主权最后归回了祖国。
    1948年8月，美国国务院发表的“关于中美关系”的白皮书承认：“台湾应归还中国”。1949年12月23日美国国务院的“关于台湾的政策宣传指示”中又承认：“台湾在政治上、地理上和战略上都是中国的一部分”。1950年1月5日，美国总统杜鲁门发表声明说：美国“承认中国对该岛（台湾）行使主权”。同年2月9日，美国国务院就台湾问题回答众议院外交委员会时，承认台湾自1945年起就已经“包括在中国之内成为一省”。
    现在，美帝国主义不顾历史事实，背弃国际协议和它自己承担的国际义务，竟侵占我国台湾澎湖和其他沿海岛屿，干涉中国内政，并进行军事挑衅。这是中国人民所绝对不能容许的。中国人民决心解放这些岛屿，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略行为。　（恕）
