Grab Tightly, Grab Fiercely!

The key to fulfilling the plan of doubling steel production this year lies in pig iron. What is the current situation of pig iron production? Comparing the situation in early September with that in early August, there was an increase of 18.5%. Moreover, during these ten days, the development trend of pig iron production was also rising daily. The average daily output in the first five days increased by 14% compared to August, and the average daily output in the latter five days increased even more rapidly, by 38% compared to August. All these indicate that the pig iron production situation is getting better day by day, which is a good thing to be happy about. However, we should not forget that for industrial production departments, the most important indicator to measure the quality of work is not anything else, but how well the national plan is completed. Judging by this standard, it is undeniable that the pig iron production situation is not good. In most provinces and autonomous regions across the country, the cumulative figures for pig iron production in early September are far from the planned figures for September, and some provinces and autonomous regions have even only completed a few percent of the monthly plan. If this continues, many provinces and autonomous regions will be in danger of failing to meet their September pig iron production plans. If the pig iron plan fails, the steel production plan will also fail. This is by no means alarmist, and the current situation does indeed deserve serious vigilance.

However, seeing this situation, there is no reason to be pessimistic. "Watchers" should wait, it is too early to draw conclusions! We have always been revolutionary optimists. Think about how difficult the Long March across the snowy mountains and grasslands was, didn't we successfully walk through it? The War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation were also very difficult, but we still overcame them. And the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, facing the world's number one imperialism, we fought hard with the Korean people for more than two years and finally drove it back to the 38th parallel. What difficulties and hardships could be greater than these? Since our Party can lead the people to defeat the living enemies—the powerful class enemies and national enemies—what reason do we have not to overcome the difficulties on the steel front?

This is not empty talk. Don't believe it? Look at Guizhou. Guizhou Province is at the forefront of the country in completing its pig iron production plan. The province planned to produce 9,000 tons of pig iron in September, and by September 14th, it had already produced more than 14,000 tons of pig iron. That is to say, Guizhou Province used less than half of the time to overfulfill the monthly plan by 59%. Now, they have put forward new goals and raised the September pig iron production plan to 40,000 tons. This is a red flag on the pig iron production front. Anyone has reason to draw the conclusion from the example of Guizhou Province: what Guizhou Province can do, why can't we do it?

Is it possible that Guizhou Province's planned targets are low, and although it seems to have overfulfilled the monthly plan more than ten days in advance, the actual output is not much? No. Guizhou Province's pig iron production, even in terms of absolute figures, is ahead of many provinces. Is it possible that Guizhou Province has particularly advantageous conditions? No. Everyone knows that Guizhou is a province with a very weak industrial base. There are no modern large blast furnaces with a daily output of thousands of tons; even the number of native blast furnaces was limited in the past. Other provinces and autonomous regions have encountered some problems in the development of pig iron production, such as native blast furnaces and small blast furnaces being built but unable to be put into production in large quantities, and once put into production, they cannot produce iron normally; and problems such as technical inexperience and insufficient labor. Guizhou Province has also encountered these. Heaven has not given the people of Guizhou any "special treatment."

So, why is Guizhou Province able to complete its pig iron production plan ahead of schedule? The main reason is that the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China grasped pig iron production, and grasped it tightly and fiercely. As early as the end of July, when the construction project of more than 14,000 native blast furnaces in Guizhou Province was fully launched, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered that more than 74% of the completed native blast furnaces could not be put into production immediately, and promptly sounded the alarm, requiring Party committees at all levels to immediately shift the focus of their leadership to grasping iron production after the completion of the native blast furnaces, preparing conditions for organizing a high tide of pig iron production. Subsequently, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also grasped the specific difficulties in pig iron production, such as fuel, technology, and labor, summarized the experience of the masses, proposed specific measures, boosted morale, and broke through several obstacles. In the past, native blast furnaces in Guizhou Province mostly used charcoal as fuel, and there was a saying of "eating by chasing the mountains." Once the forests were burned out, they had to move. In order to solve the fuel problem, they promoted the experience of using anthracite to make iron. Faced with insufficient technical strength, they mobilized folk "five craftsmen" and adopted methods such as holding on-site meetings and teaching and learning simultaneously to solve the shortage of labor by relying on the wisdom of the masses and carrying out technological innovation. Recently, the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee also sent out "medical teams," and with seven days as a battle, every time a battle ended, they conducted a general inspection, summarized, and put forward new tasks. From this, it can be seen that the reason why Guizhou Province's pig iron production plan is completed well is not because there are no difficulties, but because the leadership grasps tightly, does not relax every link, is good at predicting difficulties, and summarizes the experience of the masses to solve difficulties. There is no other secret.

Can these methods be adopted in other parts of the country? Of course. The conditions in many places may be even better than those in Guizhou Province, and even if they are worse, they are not insurmountable difficulties. Of course, obtaining more than 10 million tons of iron is never as easy as speaking or writing an article, it takes a lot of effort. But who can deny that since the Great Leap Forward, no matter where in the country, the masses have been full of energy? With the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, what difficulties cannot be overcome? The Party Central Committee's decision to double steel production this year, in addition to other conditions, is mainly because it firmly believes that once the Party's socialist general line is grasped by the people, it will generate the material power to move mountains and overturn seas. We cannot rely on God, nor can we rely on Buddha, we can only rely on the people under the leadership of the Party. The current difficulties in pig iron production, although they cannot be taken lightly, are not without solutions. At present, there are many good experiences created by the masses in various places, and there are many red flags of native blast furnaces that can produce iron normally and in large quantities. As long as we fully mobilize the masses, grasp the summary and promotion of advanced experience in this regard, and promptly turn the experience of the advanced into the wealth of the whole people, as long as all localities grasp tightly and fiercely like Guizhou, we believe that the national pig iron production situation will not be difficult to fundamentally improve in a short period of time.

Time is precious. As the saying goes: "An inch of time is an inch of gold, but an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time." The ancients cherished every inch of time, and we must cherish every minute. This is especially true in September. If the steel production plan for September is completed, it will be easier to catch up in October, and 10.7 million tons of steel will be guaranteed. If the steel production plans for these two months fail, it will be more difficult to make a rush in November and December. As we pay tribute to the people of Guizhou, who are far away from Beijing, our hearts are towards the north and south of the Yangtze River, inside and outside the Great Wall, towards the more than 20 million comrades who are fighting day and night on the steel front. We firmly believe that you will also be able to overcome all difficulties, and will be able to complete and overfulfill the national plan for steel production. We are waiting for your good news.

    紧紧地抓，狠狠地抓！
    完成年内钢产加番的计划，关键在于生铁。目前生铁生产的情况怎么样呢？拿9月上旬的情况同8月上旬比较增长了18.5％。而且在这十天里，生铁生产的发展趋势也是逐日上升的。前五天的日产量平均比8月份增长14％，后五天的日产量更突飞猛进，平均比8月份增长38％。这些都说明生铁生产的情况一天比一天好，是值得高兴的好事情。然而，我们也不应该忘记，对于工业生产部门说来，衡量工作好坏的最重要的标志，不是别的，而是国家计划完成的情况如何。拿这个标准来检查，毋庸讳言，生铁生产的情况是不好的。全国绝大部分省和自治区，9月上旬生铁产量的累计数字，距9月份的计划数字还有很大距离，有些省和自治区甚至只完成月计划的百分之几。照这样下去，许多省和自治区9月份的生铁生产计划就有落空的危险。生铁计划如果落空，钢产计划也会跟着落空。这决不是危言耸听，目前的情况的确值得严重警惕。
    但是，看到这种情况，也没有理由悲观，“观潮派”且慢，做结论还早着呢！我们向来是革命的乐观主义者。试想想，过雪山、越草地的万里长征多么艰难，我们不是胜利地走过来了吗？抗日战争关、解放战争关，又是多么不容易，我们还是闯过来了。还有抗美援朝战争，面对着世界头号帝国主义，我们同朝鲜人民一起，苦战两年多，最后还是把它赶回三八线去了。有什么艰难困苦，会比这些更甚？既然我们党能够领导人民打败了活的敌人——强大的阶级敌人和民族敌人，有什么理由我们不能战胜钢铁战线上的困难呢？
    这不是空口说大话。不信？请看贵州。贵州省在完成生铁生产计划方面走在全国的最前面。这个省9月份计划生产生铁九千吨，到9月14日已经生产了生铁一万四千多吨。这就是说，贵州省只用了不到二分之一的时间，就超额59％完成了月计划。现在，他们又提出了新的奋斗目标，把9月份的生铁生产计划提高到四万吨。这是生铁生产战线上的一面红旗。任何人都有理由从贵州省的例子得出结论：贵州省能做到的，为什么我们不能做到？
    莫非贵州省的计划指标低，看起来虽然提前十几天超额完成月计划，但实际产量并没有多少？不。贵州省的生铁产量，即便拿绝对数字来说，也走在许多省的前面。莫非贵州省有什么特别优越的条件？也不。谁都知道贵州是一个工业基础很薄弱的省份。那里既没有日产千吨的现代化大高炉；过去连土高炉的数目也有限。别的省和自治区发展生铁生产中碰到的一些问题，例如土高炉和小高炉建成了不能大量投入生产，投入生产了又不能正常出铁；又例如技术不熟练，劳动力不足等等，贵州省也都碰到过。苍天并没有给贵州人民任何的“特别优待”。
    那么，为什么贵州省能够提前超额完成生铁生产计划呢？最主要的原因就在于中共贵州省委抓了生铁生产，而且紧紧地抓、狠狠地抓了。早在7月底，当贵州省一万四千多座土高炉的建设工程全面铺开之后，中共贵州省委就发现在已建成的土高炉中有74％多一点不能马上投入生产，就及时敲起了警钟，要求各级党委在土高炉建成后立即把领导的重心转入抓出铁，为组织生铁生产的高潮准备了条件。随后，中共贵州省委又抓住了生铁生产中的燃料、技术和劳动力等具体困难，总结群众的经验，提出具体措施，鼓足干劲，连破数关。贵州省的土高炉过去大都用木炭做燃料，有“赶山吃饭”的说法，山林烧光，就得搬家。为了解决燃料的问题，他们推广了无烟煤炼铁的经验。技术力量不足，他们就动员民间“五匠”，采取召开现场会议，边教、边学等办法来解决劳动力不足，又靠发挥群众智慧，进行技术革新。最近，贵州省委又派出了“医疗大队”，并且以七天为一个战役，每到一个战役结束的时候，普遍检查一次，总结一次，提出新的任务。从这可以看出，贵州省生铁生产计划完成得好，不是因为没有困难，而是由于领导上抓得紧，不放松每一个环节，善于预见到困难，总结群众的经验去解决困难。除此之外，别无秘诀。
    这些办法是不是全国其他地方都可以采取呢？当然可以。许多地方的条件可能还比贵州省还好一些，即使差一些也不是不可克服的困难。当然，拿到一千多万吨铁总不会像说话、写文章这么容易，要费很大的劲。但是，谁能否认，大跃进以来，不论天南地北、天涯海角，人民群众都干劲冲天呢？有了群众的革命干劲，又有什么困难不可以克服呢？党中央决定今年钢产翻一番，除了其他条件外，主要是深信党的社会主义总路线一旦为人民群众所掌握，就会产生移山倒海的物质力量。我们既不能靠上帝，也不能靠佛爷，只能靠党领导下的人民群众。目前生铁生产中的困难，固然不可以等闲视之，但也不是没有办法解决。目前各地都有许多群众创造的好经验，都有许多能正常出铁、大量出铁的土高炉红旗。只要充分发动群众，抓紧总结和推广这方面的先进经验，及时把先进者的经验变成全民的财富，只要各地都像贵州那样紧紧地抓狠狠地抓，我们相信，全国生铁生产的情况不难在短期内根本好转。
    时间是宝贵的。古语云：“一寸光阴一寸金，寸金难买寸光阴”。古人惜寸阴，吾人必得惜分阴。9月份尤其如此。9月的钢铁生产计划完成了，10月份就比较容易赶上去了，一千零七十万吨钢就有保障了。如果这两个月的钢铁生产计划落空了，11月和12月再来突击就比较困难了。当我们在这里向远离北京的贵州人民致敬的时候，我们的心向着大江南北、长城内外，向着日夜奋战在钢铁战线上的两千多万同志们。我们深信你们也一定能够排除万难，一定能够完成和超额完成钢铁生产的国家计划。我们等待着你们的好消息。
