Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Montevideo: According to recent newspaper reports, the United States' policy of dumping agricultural products on Latin American countries has disrupted the traditional trade relations between these countries and damaged their economies.

According to reports, a large portion of Argentina's wheat was originally exported to Brazil, while importing timber, coffee, and other products from Brazil. However, due to the United States dumping agricultural products in Brazil, Argentina's wheat exports have declined, and Argentina, in order to maintain the level of its trade balance, has had to reduce imports from Brazil. Thus, due to the United States, the foreign trade of both Brazil and Argentina has been affected.

For the same reason, Uruguay's exports of wheat and flour to Brazil have been hindered, making it difficult for Uruguay to purchase coffee and cotton from Brazil. In addition, because the United States dumps cotton, Peru has been squeezed out of several of its best cotton markets.

On the other hand, the United States has reaped huge profits from the policy of dumping agricultural products at the expense of the economic interests of Latin American countries. According to materials published in the newspapers, all wheat-producing countries in Latin America have experienced varying degrees of stagnation in wheat exports since the war; however, during the same period, U.S. wheat exports have almost doubled. In the past year alone, the United States has earned as much as $1.125 billion from dumping wheat and other grains.

An article published in the Uruguayan "People's Daily" pointed out that the U.S. dumping policy is a way to remove the "nails" of surplus products during an economic crisis. In 1930, it used to throw "surplus" agricultural products into the sea or burn them; but now, it dumps these things on backward countries. The newspaper pointed out that trade relations between industrialized countries and single raw material producing countries have long hindered the economic development of Latin American countries, and the U.S. policy of dumping "surplus" agricultural products is destroying the economies of these countries by depressing the prices of raw materials produced in Latin American countries.

    美国拚命倾销过剩农产品
    拉丁美洲各国被害得好苦
    新华社11日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：据报纸最近报道，美国对拉丁美洲国家实行的倾销农产品政策破坏了拉丁美洲国家之间传统的贸易关系，损害了这些国家的经济。
    据报道，阿根廷有很大一部分小麦本来是向巴西出口，而从巴西进口木材、咖啡等产品。但是由于美国向巴西倾销农产品，阿根廷的小麦出口下降，阿根廷为了保持贸易差额的水平也就不得不减少从巴西的输入。这样，由于美国的缘故，巴西和阿根廷两国的对外贸易都受到了影响。
    由于同样缘故，乌拉圭向巴西出口小麦和面粉的事受到妨碍，从而使得乌拉圭在购买巴西的咖啡和棉花方面遇到困难。此外，因为美国倾销棉花，秘鲁已经从它最好的几个棉花市场中被排挤出去。
    另一方面美国却在牺牲拉丁美洲国家经济利益的情况下从倾销农产品的政策中获得了暴利。据报纸公布的材料，拉丁美洲所有出产小麦的国家战后在小麦出口方面都出现了程度不同的停滞状况；但是在同一期间，美国小麦的出口几乎增加了一倍。单是最近一年，美国就从倾销小麦和其他谷物方面获得了高达十一亿二千五百万美元的收入。
    乌拉圭“人民报”发表的文章指出，美国的倾销政策是一种在经济危机时期拔除剩余产品“钉子”的一种办法，它在1930年曾经把
  “剩余”农产品抛到海里或者烧毁；而现在，它却把这些东西向落后国家倾销。报纸指出，工业发达的国家同单一原料生产国之间的贸易关系长期地阻碍拉丁美洲国家经济的发展，而美国倾销“剩余”农产品的政策又在拉丁美洲国家生产的原料价格上破坏这些国家的经济。
