The crystallization of education and labor

　　Workers Write to University Students
    On August 28th, Tang Guangwei, a sophomore in the Physics Department of Peking University, received an unexpected letter from Han Chengmin, a worker at the Beijing Putty Factory. The letter read: "Our factory's production tasks have increased again. There is a new technology that we would like you to help us solve as soon as possible."
    More than half a month ago, Tang Guangwei and others participated in labor at the Beijing Putty Factory and saw that the putty mixing production work there relied entirely on manual labor using stone rollers and foot treading, which was inefficient and laborious. They wanted to use the principle of a meat grinder to create a putty mixer to replace this manual labor. Just as the model was made, the school transferred them back due to an urgent task. After they left the factory, the factory's production task increased to twenty tons, and the factory added twice as many workers, but there was still a risk of not completing the task. Han Chengmin thought of the research by students like Tang Guangwei, so he wrote a letter asking him to come and discuss it again.
    After the Party General Branch of the Physics Department of Peking University learned about this, it immediately sent Yu Zhentian, Wang Shumin, and Tang Guangwei to form a team to go to the Beijing Putty Factory. As soon as the three of them arrived at the workshop, Han Chengmin tightly grasped their hands and said: "We have been waiting for you for a long time!" The next day they made a small mixer for testing, and the first test has now been successful. They are now studying the production of a large machine to put into production.

　　工人致书大学生
    8月28日，北京大学物理系二年级学生唐光伟，接到了一封意外的来信，信上署名的是北京油灰厂工人韩承民。信里写道：“我们厂的生产任务又增加了，有一个新技术请你们赶快来帮助解决。”
    半个多月前，唐光伟等人曾在北京油灰厂里参加劳动，看到那里搅拌油灰的生产工作全靠人力用石滚子压、双脚踩，效率低，费劲大，想运用搅肉机的原理创造一部油灰搅拌机代替这种手工劳动，刚把模型做好，学校因有紧急任务就把他们调回了。他们离开工厂后，工厂的生产任务增加到二十吨，厂里新添了一倍的工人，但还是有完不成任务的危险。韩承民想起唐光伟等学生的研究，于是，就写信请他再来商量商量。
    北京大学物理系党总支知道这件事后，立即派于振田、王舒民和唐光伟组成小组去北京油灰厂。他们三人一到车间，韩承民就紧紧地握住他们的手说：“等了你们好久了！”第二天他们就做成了小搅拌机进行试验，现在第一次试验已成功。正在研究制成大型的机器投入生产。
