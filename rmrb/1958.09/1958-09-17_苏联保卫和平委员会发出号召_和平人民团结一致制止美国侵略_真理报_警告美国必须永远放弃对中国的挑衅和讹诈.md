Xinhua News Agency, September 16th, Moscow dispatch from TASS: The Soviet Peace Committee issued a statement on the 15th, firmly demanding that the United States immediately cease its aggression against China and immediately withdraw its aggressive forces from the Taiwan Strait area.

The statement condemned the continued US aggression against China. The statement said that the American aggressors should know that if they do not stop their provocations against China, they will be met with resolute resistance from all those who cherish the cause of peace.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet people unanimously and warmly support the statement made by the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, in his letter to Eisenhower, that an infringement upon the People's Republic of China is an infringement upon the Soviet Union. The statement said that the Soviet people are determined to support China's just position by all means.

The statement called on peace-loving people of all countries to speak out against the new war threat created by the United States in the Taiwan Strait area, and to unite in a common effort to immediately stop the US aggression against the Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th, TASS report: A "Pravda" observer published an article on the 14th, saying that world public opinion resolutely condemns Dulles' and Eisenhower's speeches. World public opinion can only regard their speeches as the stubborn unwillingness of the US ruling circles to consider the legitimate and inalienable rights of the great Chinese people, and their unwillingness to stop the sinister game of playing with fire in the Far East.

The article pointed out that the reason Dulles and Eisenhower recently made speeches on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area is because the unanimous condemnation of the US Far East policy from all over the world has caused anxiety in Washington, thus forcing them to try to defend US policy in the eyes of the public. The article said that, however, Dulles' and Eisenhower's speeches failed to appease the uneasy and angry public, nor did they achieve the goal of defending US policy. Their bellicose tone and intolerable threats to the 600 million Chinese people have only further aggravated the tense situation in the Far East.

The article said that, like Dulles, Eisenhower, in his speech, reversed black and white, attempting to create the impression that the real culprit of the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait area can be found anywhere, just not in Washington. The article asked, however, who is it that has been infringing on territory that has belonged to China since ancient times and using force to occupy Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other Chinese islands? Whose soldiers trampled on the land of Lebanon and forcibly established American order in that country with bayonets? Who is it that is engaging in blackmail and provocations with its navy and air force? The article said that peace-loving people of all countries have only one answer, and that is US imperialism.

Talking about Eisenhower's speech, which mentioned that the US government is willing to negotiate with the People's Republic of China, the article pointed out that, regrettably, his speech did not prove that the US government sincerely hopes to achieve results in line with the interests of easing the tense situation in the Far East in the process of negotiating with China. He also put forward conditions in advance and used intolerable ultimatum-like language to speak to China.

The article concluded by saying that the realistic way to eliminate the dangerous source of a new war in the Far East requires the United States to abandon its narrow and fundamentally unrealistic attitude toward the great historical changes that have taken place in China. The legitimate rights and interests of the People's Republic of China must be recognized, and the policy of provocation and blackmail against the Chinese people must be abandoned forever.

    苏联保卫和平委员会发出号召
    和平人民团结一致制止美国侵略
    “真理报”警告美国必须永远放弃对中国的挑衅和讹诈
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联保卫和平委员会15日发表声明，坚决要求美国立即停止对中国的侵略，并且立即从台湾海峡地区撤出侵略军队。
    声明谴责美国继续对中国进行的侵略行为。声明说，美国侵略者应该知道，如果他们不停止对中国的挑衅，他们就要遭到一切珍视和平事业的人们的坚决反击。
    声明指出，苏联人民一致热烈拥护苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在给艾森豪威尔的信中所作的这一声明，即：侵犯中华人民共和国就是侵犯苏联。声明说，苏联人民决心用一切方法支援中国的正义立场。
    声明呼吁各国爱好和平的人们大声疾呼，反对美国在台湾海峡地区制造的新战争威胁，并且团结起来共同努力，以便立即制止美国对中国人民的侵略。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社报道：“真理报”观察家14日发表文章说，世界公众坚决谴责杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔的演说。世界公众只能把他们的演说看作是美国统治集团顽固地不愿意考虑伟大中国人民的合法的和不可剥夺的权利，不想停止在远东的罪恶玩火勾当。
    文章指出，杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔最近之所以就台湾海峡地区局势问题发表演说，是由于世界各地对美国远东政策的一致声讨引起了华盛顿的不安，从而迫使他们不得不设法在公众面前为美国的政策辩解。文章说，但是，杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔的演说既没有能够安定不安的、愤怒的公众，也没有能够达到为美国政策辩解的目的。他们好战的口吻和对六亿中国人民的不能容忍的威胁只不过更加加剧了远东的紧张局势。
    文章说，跟杜勒斯一样，艾森豪威尔在他的演说中颠倒黑白，企图造成这样的印象：台湾海峡地区紧张局势的真正罪人可以随便到任何地方去找，只是不要到华盛顿去找。文章问道，然而，侵犯自古以来就属于中国的领土并用武力侵占台湾、澎湖列岛和中国其他岛屿的是谁？践踏黎巴嫩的土地并且依靠刺刀在这个国家硬行建立美国秩序的是哪一国的士兵？是谁用海军和空军进行讹诈和挑衅？文章说，爱好和平的各国人民只有一个回答，这就是美国帝国主义。
    谈到艾森豪威尔演说中所谓美国政府愿意同中华人民共和国进行谈判这一点时，文章指出，遗憾的是，他的演说并没有证明，美国政府真心希望在同中国谈判过程中取得符合缓和远东紧张局势的利益的成果。他还预先提出了条件，还要用不能容忍的最后通牒式的语言同中国说话。
    文章最后说，消除远东新战争的危险策源地的现实途径，要求美国放弃它对中国所发生的伟大的历史变革所采取的狭隘的、根本不现实的态度。必须承认中华人民共和国的合法权利和利益，必须永远放弃对中国人民的挑衅和讹诈政策。
