    The Steel Transportation Line That Never Sleeps
    By our reporter Zhao Yuxin
    In the past decade, I have seen all kinds of vehicles on the streets of Tianjin, but one night in mid-September, I had my eyes opened once again. That night, the entire city mobilized all vehicles that could move to transport "supplies" to the steel commander. In addition to trains, cars, electric vehicles, and endless horse-drawn carts, tricycles, and flatbed carts, even the leaders' cars, newly manufactured tractors, sanitation workers' garbage trucks, mothers' prams, machine factory tool carts, hospital four-wheeled operating beds, and single-wheeled, double-wheeled, and even more than a dozen wheeled hand-pushed, human-pulled, and foot-pedaled vehicles of unknown names were all mobilized. At two o'clock in the morning, when the roads should have been empty and people scarce, that night, the mighty stream of vehicles and horses, and the crowds carrying things on their shoulders and in their hands, made the Liuwei Road, which could accommodate six trucks side by side, seem narrow. People who wanted to cross this road found it as difficult as crossing a parade during the "May Day" holiday. From Jiefang Bridge to the materials depot of Tianjin Steel Plant in the eastern suburbs, more than ten miles away, the transportation army was shoulder to shoulder, never ceasing throughout the night.

    The District Committee Secretary's Car
    In the jubilant transportation队伍, a beige car was particularly eye-catching. Was it some leader taking a car to inspect things in the middle of the night? As the car approached, people saw that there was no one else in the car except the driver, and the dark scrap steel touched the car's glass window. "The car is also participating in transportation!" such exclamations were heard from the crowd.

    The car had just passed when a transportation army of more than four hundred bicycles quickly followed. Comrade Liu Ya, the secretary of the Hebei District Committee, who usually rode in this car, was sweating profusely as he pushed more than a hundred pounds of scrap iron on his bicycle, racing with the young people. Under the leadership of the secretary, 180,000 residents of Hebei District participated in the scrap steel collection campaign, collecting more than 2,900 tons in just two days and nights, and sending it all to Tianjin Steel Plant.

    Night Battle at Gate No. 6
    Gate No. 6 is a gate of the East Freight Yard of Tianjin Railway Station; in the past, the porters of Tianjin Railway Station fought bravely here against the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang reactionaries. That night, drums of war and red flags were flying at Gate No. 6 again. More than a thousand workers, students, and family members from the railway system, participating in voluntary labor, were launching a battle to clear the way for the steel marshal in the freight yard where goods were piled up like mountains. In recent days, there has been a particularly large amount of steelmaking raw materials transported from all parts of Hebei Province. The accumulated goods must be cleared out so that the new "supplies" of the steel commander can come in in large quantities.

    The warriors participating in voluntary labor were all as if they were on the battlefield. They were organized into "Rocket Battalion" and "Red Flag Company." At the order of the battalion and company commanders, people pushed, carried, and shouldered, quickly transporting stacks of cotton yarn, wool paper, graphite, glass bottles, etc. from Gate No. 6 to the warehouses of the owners. The most enthusiastic in their work were the more than three hundred fifteen- and sixteen-year-old middle school students from the Railway Middle School. Like playing the game of rolling iron hoops, they rolled a car tire each, running fast on the road, from Gate No. 6 all the way to the factory warehouse three miles away. That night, this voluntary labor army used this method of "ants moving a mountain" to transport away the materials unloaded from thirteen trains.

    Abundant "Provisions"
    If, ten days ago, Tianjin Steel Plant was still short of "provisions," now it is like an agricultural cooperative that has just reaped a bumper harvest. In the plant's materials depot, which covers thousands of acres, more than 150 trains fully loaded with scrap steel and pig iron come in every day along the dedicated railway line; more than 20 wooden boats sail in along the Haihe River; the people of Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and other regions are very eager to support the steel commander's ascension, and they drive horse-drawn carts through the night, transporting scrap steel directly to the steel plant from hundreds of miles away. The transportation army from all streets and alleys of the city is even more tireless day and night. Now, there are one or two thousand people participating in voluntary unloading at this plant every day. The plant area, which used to be covered with grass, is now filled with stacks of steelmaking raw materials piled up like mountains.

    The actions of the people of the whole province and the whole city to fully support steel production have further encouraged the determination of the workers of Tianjin Steel Plant to seize steel from time. Recently, the steelworkers have moved their luggage to the side of the steelmaking furnace, eating at the plant and sleeping at the plant, determined to over fulfill the production plan.

    不夜的钢铁运输线
    本报记者　赵玉昕
    近十年来，我在天津的马路上看见过各种各样的车辆，但是在本月中旬的一个晚上，却又大开了一次眼界。这一夜，全市人民为了给钢帅运送“粮草”，出动了一切能够转动的车辆。除了火车、汽车、电瓶车和望不到头的马车、三轮车、地排车以外，连首长的小轿车、出厂不久的拖拉机、清洁工人的垃圾车、妈妈们的摇篮车、机器厂的工具车、医院里四个轱辘的手术床和独轮、双轮直到十几个轱辘叫不出名目的手推、人拉、脚踏的车辆都出动了。深夜两点，正该是路空人稀的时候，但是这天晚上，浩浩荡荡的车马，肩挑手提的人群，使并排可以行走六辆卡车的六纬路显得狭窄了。人们想横过这条马路，就像“五一”节横穿游行队伍那样困难。从解放桥直到十多里外的东郊天津钢厂的材料总库，运输大军摩肩接踵，彻夜不绝。
    区委书记的小轿车
    在人欢马跃的运输队伍里，一辆米黄色的小轿车特别引人注意。是哪位首长深更半夜地还坐着汽车来视察呢？汽车临近了，人们看清楚这辆车上除司机以外，再无他人，黑黝黝的废钢铁直触到小轿车的玻璃窗口。“小轿车也参加运输了！”人群里发出了这样的呼声。
    小轿车刚刚过去，一起由四百多辆自行车组成的运输大军飞快地跟了上来。平常乘坐这辆小轿车的河北区委书记刘亚同志，正汗流浃背地用自行车推着一百多斤废铁，同青年们一起赛跑。在书记领导下，河北区有十八万居民参加了搜集废钢铁的运动，只两天两夜的功夫，就搜集了二千九百多吨，并且全部送到了天津钢厂。
    夜战六号门
    六号门，是天津车站东货场的一个大门；当年天津车站的搬运工人曾在这里对日伪和国民党反动派作过殊死的斗争。这天夜里，六号门里又是战鼓咚咚，红旗飘扬。这是铁路系统的一千多名参加义务劳动的职工、学生和家属们，在货物堆积如山的货场内，开展了一场为钢铁元帅开路的斗争。最近几天，由河北全省各地运来的炼钢原料特别多。必须把堆积的货物清理出去，钢帅的大批新“粮草”才能进来。
    参加义务劳动的勇士，一个个如临场战。他们编成了“火箭营”、“红旗连”。营、连长一声令下，人们便推的推、抬的抬、扛的扛，迅速地把一垛垛的棉纱、毛头纸、石墨、玻璃瓶等由六号门运送到货主的仓库里。工作得最有兴致的是铁路中学三百多名十五、六岁的中学生。他们像做滚铁环游戏一样，一人滚着一个汽车轮胎，在马路上飞跑，从六号门一直送到三里以外的工厂仓库里。这天晚上，这支义务劳动大军就用这种“蚂蚁搬泰山”的办法，一共运走了十三辆火车卸下来的物资。
    “粮饷”丰富
    如果说，在十天以前天津钢厂还闹“粮饷”不足的话，现在它正像个刚刚获得丰收的农业社。在这个厂上千亩面积的材料总库，每天要沿着专用铁路线开进来一百五十多辆满载着废钢铁和生铁的火车；顺着海河划过来二十多艘木船；保定、石家庄等地区的人民，支援钢帅升帐的心情十分迫切，他们星夜赶着马车，从数百里外把废钢铁直接送进钢厂。来自全市各街巷的运输大军更是昼夜不息。现在，到这个厂参加义务卸运的每天都有一两千人。过去长了青草的厂地，现在一垛垛的炼钢原料已经堆积如山了。
    全省、全市人民全力支援钢铁生产的行动，进一步鼓舞了天津钢厂工人向时间夺钢的决心。最近，炼钢工人们纷纷把行李搬到炼钢炉旁，吃在厂，睡在厂，立志要超额完成生产计划。
