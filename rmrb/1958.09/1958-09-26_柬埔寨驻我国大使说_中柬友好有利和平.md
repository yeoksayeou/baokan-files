Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, September 25th: Cambodia's first ambassador to China, Lang Neth, arrived in Hong Kong from Phnom Penh on the 24th and met with reporters from this agency to discuss relations between China and Cambodia. Ambassador Lang Neth will arrive in Beijing on the 26th to assume his duties as ambassador.

Ambassador Lang Neth said: The current relationship between China and Cambodia is friendly and normal, and it is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the friendly relations between the two countries will definitely have greater development. He said: The friendly relations between China and Cambodia have a long history, but the intrusion of Western countries interrupted the relations between the two countries for a period of time. Now that both countries are independent, it is very natural for our relations to return to normal.

Ambassador Lang Neth pointed out: The purpose of establishing diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia is to strengthen cooperation between the two countries and strive for lasting world peace. He said: Establishing friendly relations with all countries in the world is a policy formulated by Prime Minister Sihanouk based on the wishes of the Cambodian people. We love peace, and our intention is to make friends with everyone based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    柬埔寨驻我国大使说
    中柬友好有利和平
    新华社香港25日电  柬埔寨首任驻中国大使兰·涅特24日由金边抵达香港接见本社记者，就中国和柬埔寨两国之间的关系发表了谈话。兰·涅特大使将在26日前来北京就任大使之职。
    兰·涅特大使说：目前中柬两国间的关系是友好的和正常的，它是以五项原则为基础的，在两国建立外交关系以后，两国的友好关系一定有更大的发展。他说：中柬两国的友好关系历史悠久，只不过因为西方国家的侵入，使得两国之间的关系在一个时期中断了，现在，两国都已经独立了，因此我们之间的关系恢复正常是非常自然的。
    兰·涅特大使指出：中柬两国建立外交关系的目的是加强两国间的合作，为世界持久和平而努力。他说：同世界所有国家建立友好关系，是西哈努克首相根据柬埔寨人民的愿望而制订的政策，我们热爱和平，我们的意愿是根据和平共处的五项原则和所有人做朋友。
