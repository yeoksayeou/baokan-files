    Female Miners
    Ai Wu
    Beneath a tall mountain, eight or nine female workers, clad in black work clothes, wearing rattan hats; with mining lamps attached to their hats and battery packs hanging from their waistbands, were sitting under the eaves, waiting to go to work, to descend into the mine shaft.

    This was the first time I had seen female miners, and I couldn't help but talk to them. It turned out that just a month prior, they were still family members of the miners at the Chengzi Coal Mine, just cooking meals and taking care of children at home, sometimes playing cards with neighbors, and according to them, the days were very boring. The farmers around the Chengzi Coal Mine also had idle gossip: The worker elder brothers are good, but the worker elder sisters are not. But the wave of the Great Leap Forward finally rushed into their daily lives, and they couldn't stay quiet, eagerly demanding to work. And the Chengzi Coal Mine's output in 1957 was 370,000 tons, which leaped to an annual output of 650,000 tons in 1958. New mine shafts were being built, and everything was going to be converted to hydraulic mining. The labor force was greatly insufficient, so should they ask the surrounding rural areas for people? The rural areas, in their efforts to achieve a great harvest, also felt the manpower shortage, so women's participation in labor was bound to be extremely welcome. The leaders of the Chengzi Coal Mine organized the family members of the workers and established a family production cooperative, with more than a thousand people signing up. The cooperative had as many as twenty-seven kinds of work, transporting stone slag, repairing roads, manufacturing cement, blacksmithing, learning fitter work, lathe work, raising rabbits, raising sheep, sewing… Many women requested to go down into the mine, to do the same work as men. Only forty-five were approved, and they were divided into four shifts to work underground. This shift starts work at 2:00 PM and doesn't return to the surface until 10:00 PM. I asked them if the work was tiring, and if they were used to working underground. Jiang Shuzhen, who was sitting next to me, was the team leader, with a strong body, and on her young, red face, she looked extremely happy, saying:

    “How could it be tiring.” After she finished speaking, her hearty laughter showed that she would not feel tired.

    I couldn't help but ask again: Do your family members object to you going down into the mine to work?

    Tong Guifang immediately interjected:

    “No one can stop us. My family is even better to me. As soon as my husband sees me come home, he rushes to ask, ‘Are you tired? Go and rest for a while,’ he also said: ‘It really takes strength to pass through the return air tunnel,’ he works in the mine himself. Some male workers are so tired they pant heavily when passing through the return air tunnel, and I laugh when I walk behind them, I don't pant at all. He never used to fetch water for me. If you asked him to fetch water, he would scold you, ‘What are you doing at home?’ Now it's great, as soon as he rests, he fills the water tank to the brim. My mother-in-law didn't used to help me take care of the children, but now she takes good care of them. As soon as I get back, she's afraid the children will pester me, so she quickly takes them away and tells me to rest. My mother-in-law also said: ‘It's really good that you're like this, there's a nursery nearby now, I'm going to work too.’”

    When she spoke, her face under the rattan hat and mining lamp looked happy and solemn. It could be seen that the happiness of life was coming upon her.

    Soon, it was time for them to go to work, and they happily went down into the mine. Among the group of miners who came up next, more than a dozen female miners appeared again. They were also wearing black work clothes, wearing rattan hats, the mining lamps on their hats were still bright, but their faces were black, and their hands were also black. I immediately invited them to sit under the eaves. Some of them took off their rattan hats, some took off the battery packs tied to their backs, and some even took out towels to wipe their faces. I saw that they didn't look tired at all, but were very excited, bursting into laughter from time to time. Comrade Zhang Jincai, who worked at the Chengzi Coal Mine Trade Union, said to me: "This team of theirs is the most active. The Jiu Lan group at the Ming Tombs Reservoir isn't as strong as they are." Then he said to them: "I'm working on a drama, preparing for you to perform it before National Day."

    One team member said in surprise:

    "Are we going to perform a play again?"

    Another team member showed an extremely heroic expression, saying:

    "If we're going to perform, then we'll perform!"

    I asked them if they liked working in the mine. Bai Xiuying, the deputy team leader, whose face looked slightly thin, said with a smile:

    "Now everyone is afraid of being transferred up here."

    Another team member搶着 said:

    "It's cool down there, and if you stop moving, you'll even feel cold. It's not like up here, where you sweat even when you're sitting."

    I asked: Before you participated in work, and after you participated in work, what are your different feelings?

    Ma Xiurong, who was sitting next to me, had only been married for a year, and on her chubby face, she revealed a look that was always about to smile, and said straightforwardly:

    "In the past, I always felt that I had enough to wear and eat, why would I do any work? Even if you gave me five yuan a day, I wouldn't want to go down into the mine. Now, it's different. Everyone in the country is working, everyone is in the Great Leap Forward, how can I sit still? Now I don't want a penny, I still want to work."

    Finally, another female miner came, she was forty years old. She was the oldest of the female miners, named Zhang Shujun. I asked her to sit next to me and asked her if she felt any difficulties working in the mine.

    She unbuttoned her work clothes and said quietly with a smile:

    "There are no difficulties that cannot be overcome."

    I asked: How is your husband to you?

    She said mockingly:

    "I'm old, I'm too embarrassed to talk about husband and wife." Then she said seriously: "My man also works in the mine, he's very good to me. He gets off work first, so he cooks first, and when I get back, there's something to eat." Then she said with a sigh-like smile: "I've always cooked for him, I never thought he would cook for me."

    Comrade Zhang Jincai interjected:

    "Ever since the family members were organized, every family has been harmonious. Before, the trade union always had one person to resolve family disputes every day. There was a worker who was so angry that he didn't want to go home, because his wife blamed him for not fetching water, not making coal balls, and not taking care of the children..."

    As they walked home, I looked at their strong figures and felt that women with a new communist style were being born on our land, making people feel infinite joy. Zhao Zhifang Illustration

    女矿工
  　艾芜
    在一座高大的山下边，有八九个女工，身穿黑色工作服，头上戴着藤帽；帽上插着矿灯，背后腰带上挂着灯箱，坐在屋檐下，正等待上班，下到矿井下面去工作。
    这是我第一次看见了女矿工，忍不住和她们谈了起来。原来在一个月以前，她们还是城子煤矿矿工的家属，只是在家煮饭带孩子，有时同邻居打打扑克，据她们自己说，日子过得很腻。城子煤矿周围的农民，也有闲言闲语：工人老大哥不错，老大嫂可不成。但是大跃进的浪潮，终于冲进了她们日常生活的圈子，她们安静不下来，热烈地要求劳动。而城子煤矿1957年产量三十七万吨，1958年跃进到年产六十五万吨，正在新建矿井，还要全部改为水力采煤，劳动力大大不够了，向周围的农村要人吗？农村因争取大丰收，也感人力不够，于是妇女参加劳动，势必受到极大的欢迎。城子煤矿的领导把工人家属组织起来，成立家属生产合作社，报名的达到千人以上。合作社工作有二十七种之多，运石渣，修道路，制造水泥，打铁，学钳工，车工，养兔、养羊、缝纫……。有许多妇女要求下井，要和男人一样的工作。得到批准的只有四十五名，分为四班下井工作。现在这一班是下午二时上班，晚上十时才再回到地面上来。我问她们工作累不累，开始在井下工作习不习惯。坐在我身边的蒋淑珍，正是队长，身体健壮，在她年青发红的脸上，显得极其愉快地说：
    “哪里会累。”说完后，她那爽朗的笑声，就说明她是不会感到累的。
    我忍不住又问：你们下井去工作，家里人不阻挡吗？
    童桂芳，立刻接口说：
    “谁也阻挡不了的。我家里人倒对我好了。我爱人一见我回去，就连忙问，‘你累不累？快去休息一下’，他还说：‘下边过回道巷，真要把气力’，他就是在井下做工的。有些男工过回道巷累得呼哧呼哧的，我走在后面好笑起来，我一点也不喘气。他以前从不替我挑水的，你叫他挑，他可骂你，你在家里干甚么？这回可好了，他一休息，就把水缸挑的满满的。我的婆婆，过去也不帮我带孩子，这回她就带得好好的。一回去，她怕孩子缠我，赶快把孩子带开，要我休息。我婆婆还说：你这样真好，近边有托儿所了，我也要去干活。”
    她讲的时候罩在藤帽矿灯下面的脸子，显得愉快而又庄严。可以看出人生的幸福，正临到她的身上。
    不久，她们上班的时候到了，愉快地下到井下去。接着上来的一群矿工中，又出现了十多个女矿工。她们也是穿着黑的工作服，头戴藤帽，帽上的矿灯还是亮亮的，只是脸子黑黑的，手也是黑黑的。我立即招呼她们在屋檐下坐。她们有的取下藤帽，有的取下拴在背后腰上的灯箱，有的还摸出手巾擦擦她们的脸子。我看她们一点也没有疲倦的样子，倒是兴奋得很，时时爆发出笑声。在城子煤矿工会工作的张进才同志对我说：“她们这一队最活跃了。十三陵水库的九兰组身体可没有她们这么棒。”接着又向她们说：“我正在琢磨一个戏剧，准备你们国庆前演出。”
    一个队员惊喜地说：
    “又要演戏吗？”
    另一个队员显出极其豪迈的神情说：
    “演就演吧！”
    我问她们喜欢在井下工作吗？脸子略微显得瘦的副队长白秀英笑着说：
    “现在大家就怕调上来哩。”
    另一个队员抢着说：
    “在下面可凉快啦，一歇下不动，还会感到冷哩。可不比上面，坐着都出汗。”
    我问：你们没有参加工作以前，和参加工作以后，有什么不同的感想。
    坐在我旁边的马秀荣，她刚结婚一年，在她胖胖的脸上，露出时时要笑的神情，爽直地说：
    “在以前，总觉得穿吃够了，干什么活，给我五元钱一天，我也不愿下井去。现在，可不同了，全国人人都在劳动，都在大跃进，怎坐下呢？现在一个钱不要，也要劳动。”
    最后又来了一个女矿工，她有四十岁了。她是女矿工中年纪最大的一个，名叫张淑俊，我让她坐在我的旁边，问她在井下工作感不感到困难。
    她一面解开她的工作服，笑着静静地说：
      “没有什么困难克服不了的。”
    我问：你爱人对你怎么样：
    她嘲笑地说：
    “年纪大了，还好意思说什么爱人。”接着又严肃地说：“我男人，也在井下干活，他对我可好了。他先下班，就先做饭，我回去就有吃的。”随又感叹似地笑着说：“从来就是我做给他吃，想也没有想到，他会做给我吃。”
    张进才同志插嘴说：
    “自从家属组织起来，个个家庭都和气了。先前么，每天工会总有一个人去解决家庭纠纷。有一个工人，气得不想回家，就是他的爱人怪他不挑水、不捏煤球、不带孩子……”
    她们走回家去的时候，我望着她们健壮的背影，觉得新的共产主义风格的妇女是在我们的土地上诞生出来了，使人感到无限的欣喜。赵志方插图
