    Summarizing Good Experiences in Implementing Comprehensive Education
    Soviet Union Actively Studies Reforming the Education System
    (Our dispatch) In order to closely integrate education with labor, the Soviet Union is actively studying the reform of the national education system. Since the 20th Congress of the CPSU proposed the universal implementation of comprehensive technical education, schools across the Soviet Union have created many good methods in the labor education of young people, and the Soviet education community is summarizing these experiences. The Soviet education community has proposed that secondary education should be changed to eleven to twelve years, with the first eight years being eight-year general secondary education implementing comprehensive technical education, and the last three to four years being non-full-time secondary education or secondary vocational education. At the same time, the General Administration of Labor Reserves of the Soviet Union is formulating a plan to train new workers in vocational and technical schools from 1959 to 1965. The Soviet Union plans to widely expand the network of urban and rural vocational and technical schools in the next seven years, and these schools will train a large number of secondary school graduates to become skilled workers.
    Kairov, President of the Academy of Educational Sciences of the Russian Federal Republic, wrote in "Pravda" when discussing national education issues: According to the experience of labor education accumulated in recent years, secondary education should be divided into two stages, totaling eleven to twelve years. The first stage is eight-year general secondary education, where students engage in simple labor from the lower grades. Students in grades five to eight should receive labor training in school factories and fields, or go to farms and construction sites, to prepare for labor life after graduating from school. The second stage of secondary education has two forms: one is that students leave production and study for four years in schools for workers and peasants, where they complete the general courses of secondary education and improve their professional skills in conjunction with their own production; the second form is in three- or four-year secondary industrial and agricultural schools, where students spend half of their time learning production theory and engaging in production practice, and the other half of their time completing the general courses of secondary education. The second stage of secondary education can adopt different methods depending on the local conditions in various regions.
    Zelenko, Director of the General Administration of Labor Reserves under the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, said when discussing the production labor education of young people that it is now urgent to reform the school education system to bring education closer to life. He believes that it is appropriate to change seven-year and ten-year secondary schools into eight-year schools that implement comprehensive technical education. While carrying out such reforms, it is necessary to vigorously develop secondary night schools so that young people can complete all secondary education courses while on production posts.

    总结实施综合教育的好经验
    苏联积极研究改革教育体制
    本报讯　为了使教育与劳动密切结合，苏联正在积极研究改革国民教育体制问题。自从苏共第二十次代表大会提出普遍推行综合技术教育以来，全苏各地的学校在对青年的劳动教育方面创造了很多好的方法，苏联教育界正在总结这方面的经验。苏联教育界提出，应当把中等教育改为十一年至十二年，前八年是实行综合技术教育的八年制普通中学教育，后三年至四年是不脱产的中等教育或中等专业教育。同时，苏联劳动后备总局正在制定1959年至1965年在专业技术学校培养新工人的计划。苏联计划在未来的七年中广泛扩展城乡专业技术学校网，这些学校将把大批中学毕业生培养成为熟练工人。
    俄罗斯联邦共和国教育科学院院长凯洛夫在“真理报”上探讨国民教育问题时写道：根据近几年积累的劳动教育的经验，中等教育应改分两个阶段，共十一年至十二年。第一个阶段是八年制的普通中学教育，这里的学生从低年级起就进行简单的劳动，五至八年级的学生要在学校的工厂和田地里，或到农庄、建筑工地去受劳动锻炼，为在学校毕业后的劳动生活作好准备。中等教育的第二个阶段有两种方式：一种是学生脱离生产，在工农青年学校里学习四年，一方面学完中等教育的一般课程，同时结合自己的生产提高业务水平；第二种方式是在三年或四年制的中等工业、农业学校里，学生们用一半的时间学习生产理论和进行生产实习，用另一半时间学完中等教育的一般课程。第二个阶段的中等教育，各地可以根据自己当地的情况采取不同的方式进行。
    苏联部长会议直属劳动后备总局局长泽连科谈论青年的生产劳动教育问题时说，目前已迫切需要改革学校教育制度，使教育接近生活。他认为，把七年和十年制中学改为实行综合技术教育的八年制学校是适宜的。在这样改革的同时，要大力发展中等夜校，使青年可以在生产岗位上念完全部中等教育课程。
