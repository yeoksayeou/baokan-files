Old Woman's Review of "Red Flag Spectrum"
保定市北市区六十五岁居民　寇惠云

    Kou Huiyun, 65-year-old resident of Beishi District, Baoding City
    After watching the "Red Flag Spectrum" performed by the Hebei Province Pingju Opera Troupe, I felt it was a good play, quite touching. After watching it, I had a lot of thoughts in my heart, and I felt suffocated if I didn't say them.
    Watching this play, I couldn't help but think of the time when I was bullied by the big landlords. My family was poor farmers, and my father died early, leaving only a widowed mother to raise us four sisters, living a hard life without food or clothing. From a young age, I worked as a servant for the landlord's family, watching dates, mowing grass... I did everything, and if I didn't do it well, I would be beaten and scolded. The suffering I endured was indescribable. The landlord Feng Laolan in this play, that hateful demeanor and the oppression he inflicted were exactly the same as the landlord who oppressed me. He harmed the Zhu and Yan families, causing them to flee in all directions, their families ruined. Watching it, I really hated him to the core. The kind of oppressed and exploited life that the Zhu and Yan families lived was exactly the same as the bitter life I lived earlier. The scene of Yan's mother's death was so tragic! I couldn't help but shed tears. From this play, I saw the tragic lives of peasants in the old society, and I felt even more that this happy life today did not come easily. It really took many years of hard work to get here step by step. If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we really wouldn't be able to live such a good life.
    The actors in this play all worked very hard, and the play was performed like a true story. The actor who played Zhu Laozhong played the best, bringing drama to every scene, and portraying Zhu Laozhong's strength and deepness, like a suffering person who has traveled the world and experienced life. He had generations of deep hatred for the landlord Feng Laolan, but he was not reckless. He kept the hatred in his heart, swallowed his tears, and believed that there would always be a day of revenge. Yan's mother and Lao Lvtou also played very well, vividly portraying the kind old lady and the stubborn old man, leaving no room for criticism. It's just that some of the actors' performances were still a bit lacking. For example, in the melon patch, Chunlan was originally thinking about the good days of marrying Yuntao in the future, and should be lively and happy. But the actress played it too steadily, with a bit of a melancholy look, which is not good. Furthermore, when Yan's mother died, Yan Zhihe's performance was not quite right. His mother was telling him her dying wishes, but he stood quite far away from his mother, like an unrelated person, not concerned at all. Logically, he should have thrown himself into his mother's arms and cried loudly.
    In this play, I think some of the actors' clothes still need to be changed. Some people, like Yan's mother, are dressed too extravagantly, covered in silk and satin, not like a poor peasant family. Some people, like Lao Lvtou, are dressed strangely, not like a peasant at all. Also, the Zhu and Yan families have table covers and chair cushions. In any case, poor peasant families suffering in the countryside definitely don't have this. It would be better not to use them at all, wouldn't that be more reasonable? I also feel that the script should add an explanatory note at the beginning and near the end of the play, to explain things to the audience, making the play complete from beginning to end, so that the audience can understand it better. That would be even better.
    In a word, I think this is a good play. It portrays the various evils of landlords oppressing and harming peasants in the old society, and the struggle between peasants and landlords, penetratingly. Sitting there, I didn't feel like I was watching a play, but like I was experiencing these things myself. Such a play teaches people knowledge and educates them, and is really much better than those plays that only depict young masters and young ladies. I especially love to watch it, and I hope the troupe will perform more of this kind of play.

    老大娘评“红旗谱”
    保定市北市区六十五岁居民　寇惠云
    看了河北省评剧团演的“红旗谱”，我觉着这是一出好戏，挺感动人的。看了它，自己个心里有好多话，不说出来憋的慌。
    我看了这出戏，不由得想起了受大地主欺负的那会儿。我家里是贫农，爹又死的早，就一个寡妇妈，拉扯着我们姐妹四个，过那种没吃没穿的苦日子。我从小给地主家当小使，看枣、打草……什么都干，一个不好，就是打骂，受的苦楚没法说。这出戏里的地主冯老兰，那个可恶劲和压迫我的地主分毫不差。他把朱家和严家，祸害得东逃西散，家败人亡，我看着，真恨得牙根疼。朱家和严家过的那种受压迫，受剥削的生活，也和我早先过的那苦日子一模一样。严母死的那场戏，多么惨哪！我两眼不由得掉下眼泪来。从这出戏里，我看到了在旧社会农民过的那种悲惨生活，更觉着如今这幸福的生活来的不容易。这真是多少年一步一步苦熬过来的。要是没有共产党和毛主席给咱们领导，咱可真过不上这样好的日子。
    这出戏的演员们，都挺卖力气，把戏演得像真事一样。演朱老忠的那个演员，演得最好，处处带戏，把朱老忠那股子刚强劲、深沉劲都演出来了，真像个走南闯北、经过世面的受苦人。他和地主冯老兰有几辈子的深仇大恨，可他不莽撞，把仇记在心里，把眼泪咽到肚里，他相信总会有报仇的一天。严母和老驴头演得也挺好，活像善良的老太太和顽固的老头，叫人挑不出一点毛病来。就是有个别的演员演得还差点。像春兰在瓜园里，本来是思想自己将来嫁给运涛以后的好日子，应该活活泼泼，欢欢喜喜。可那位演员演得太稳重了，还带点忧愁相，这就不好了。再有，严母死的时候，严致和演得不像那么回事。他妈临死嘱咐他话，可他站的离他妈挺远，像个旁不相干的人，一点也不挂心。按理说他应该扑到他妈怀里大哭一场才对。
    在这出戏里，有的演员穿的衣裳，我看还得改改。有的人，像严母，穿的太阔了，浑身绸缎，不像个贫农家。有的人，像老驴头，穿的古古怪怪，不像个农民样。还有朱家和严家，桌子有桌围，椅子有椅垫，反正在农村受苦的贫农家，决没这个，干脆不用多好，这样不就更入情入理了吗？我还觉着这个戏本，在未开戏和戏快演完了那会儿，应该加个说明词，给人们交代交代，把戏弄得有头有尾，叫看戏的人更好懂些。就更好了。
    一句话，我觉着这是出好戏。它把旧社会地主欺压、祸害农民那种种歹事儿，跟农民和地主斗争的情况，演得入骨三分。我坐在那里，没觉出来是看戏，就像自己个经历这些事一样。这样的戏，叫人长知识、受教育，真比那些净演公子小姐的戏强多了。我特别爱看，也盼着剧团多多的演这种戏。
