Building Furnaces to Smelt Iron, Delivering Public Grain, Strengthening Military Training
Hong'an People Turn Anger into Strength
    The people of the old revolutionary base area of Hong'an cannot suppress the anger in their hearts. They deeply hate the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism. They resolutely support Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council, Premier Zhou Enlai's statement, and Khrushchev's warning letter to Eisenhower. They firmly oppose the aggressive acts of American imperialism, and use practical actions to support the liberation of Taiwan and strike at the American warmongers!
    On the night of the 9th, 200,000 people from agricultural cooperatives, factories, government offices, schools, etc. held large-scale rallies and parades. At the meeting, Revolutionary Mother Xu said: "The American imperialists are ambitious wolves who are never reconciled to our victory. In the past, they helped Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war and harmed the Chinese people. Now, when we are establishing people's communes, they are妄想trying to invade our country and prevent us from living a happy life. We will never forget the suffering of the Soviet area people in the past, and we must never let the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek harm us again. We must liberate Taiwan, and we must rescue the suffering masses of Taiwan." Red Army Regiment Commander Fang Heming said: "In the past, in order to eliminate the Japanese devils and defeat the American-Chiang troops, we were not afraid of all kinds of hardships, crossed snow-capped mountains and walked through grasslands, on the Long March of over 25,000 li. Now, in order to support the liberation of Taiwan, we will exert even greater revolutionary vigor to improve industrial and agricultural production. In the past, we were able to defeat the modernized American-Chiang troops with 土枪土炮 homemade rifles and cannons, but now we have a strong army, navy, and air force, and we are more confident in liberating Taiwan." Retired soldier Qin Biwen said: "American imperialism should not forget the lessons of the Korean battlefield. If they dare to invade our country, we will thoroughly eliminate them!"
    The anger of the people of the whole county has turned into strength. They unanimously stated that they would use practical actions to improve industrial and agricultural production and various tasks to strike a heavy blow to the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism and support the liberation of Taiwan. They proposed: if you want steel, we'll give you steel; if you want grain, we'll give you grain; if you want oil, we'll give you oil; if you want soldiers, we'll give you soldiers; whatever you want, we'll give you; as much as you want. The whole county has dispatched more than 15,000 steel warriors to pan for sand in the rivers and mine in the mountains, building furnaces to smelt iron, and guaranteeing the production of 1,200 tons of steel before National Day to support national defense construction. At the same time, a热潮high tide of steel-making for drought resistance has been launched. The masses of the whole county have contributed more than 640,000 jin of scrap steel and iron. The labor army on the agricultural front has increased from the original 180,000 to 200,000, and all have implemented militarization. They expressed that they would both improve production, produce more grain and oil, and support the liberation of Taiwan; and strengthen military training, and be ready to strike at American imperialism and participate in the battle to liberate Taiwan at any time. A high tide of delivering public grain and selling surplus grain has also been launched in the whole county. In Bali District alone, more than 1.1 million jin of public grain were delivered in one day and one night, overfulfilling the task. On the night of the rally and parade, the masses of Gaoshan Township organized more than 3,500 people to deliver more than 230,000 jin of public grain overnight, overfulfilling the task by 15%.

    红安人民把愤怒变成了力量
    红安老苏区人民按不住心头怒火，恨透了美帝国主义的侵略野心，坚决拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话、周恩来总理的声明和赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的警告信，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略行为，用实际行动支援解放台湾，打击美国战争狂人！
    9日夜晚，全县各农业社、工厂、机关、学校等二十万人举行了大规模的集会游行。会上，革命母亲徐大妈说：“美帝国主义这个野心豺狼，总不甘心我们的胜利，过去帮助蒋介石打内战，残害中国人民，现在当我们建立人民公社的时候又妄想对我国进行侵略，不让我们过幸福日子。我们千年万载也忘记不了苏区人民过去受的苦难，我们千万也不能让美帝国主义和蒋介石再来残害我们，我们一定要解放台湾，我们一定要救出台湾的受苦群众。”红军团长方和明说：“过去我们为了消灭日本鬼子，打败美蒋军队，不怕千难万苦，过雪山走草地，长征二万五千余里。现在，为了支援解放台湾，我们将要拿出更大的革命干劲，搞好工农业生产。我们过去能用土枪土炮打败美蒋现代化的军队，现在我们有强大的陆海空军，更有把握解放台湾。”复员军人秦必文说：“美帝国主义不要忘记了朝鲜战场上的教训，如果胆敢侵略我国，我们就要彻底消灭它！”
    全县人民的愤怒变成了力量，一致表示以搞好工农业生产和各项工作的实际行动，来痛击美帝国主义的侵略野心，支援解放台湾。他们提出：要钢铁有钢铁，要粮食有粮食，要油料有油料，要兵员有兵员，要么事有么事，要多少有多少。全县已经出动了一万五千多钢铁战士下河淘沙，上山采矿，建炉炼铁，保证在国庆节前生产一千二百吨钢铁，支援国防建设。同时还掀起了钢铁抗旱热潮，全县群众已献出了六十四万多斤废钢废铁。在农业战线上的劳动大军，已由原来的十八万人增加到了二十万人，并且全部实行了军事化。他们表示：一面搞好生产，多产粮油，支援解放台湾；一面加强军事训练，随时准备打击美帝国主义，参加解放台湾的战斗。全县还掀起了交公粮、售余粮的高潮。仅八里区一天一夜就交公粮一百一十多万斤，超额完成了任务。高山乡群众在集会游行的当晚，就组织三千五百多人一夜送公粮二十三万多斤，超额15％完成任务。红安县委办公室
