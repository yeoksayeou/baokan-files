　　The People of Northern Vietnam are Advancing on the Socialist Road
    ——Written for the 13th Anniversary of the Founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    Vietnam Guang Dan

　　From the day of its establishment, the Vietnamese Labor Party clearly put forward that the Vietnamese revolution would lead the people to socialism. The spirit of this proposition was already embodied in some specific tasks during the stage of national and people's democratic revolution, and during the arduous war of resistance.
　　The war against the French colonialists and American interventionists ended with the brilliant victory of the Dien Bien Phu campaign and the 1954 Geneva Conference to restore peace in Vietnam, and North Vietnam won complete liberation. Since then, on half of Vietnam's land, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, have actively completed land reform, restored the economy, healed the wounds of war, developed the socialist factors that have emerged, gradually established and expanded the socialist foundation on all fronts, and began to implement step-by-step socialist transformation. After three years of efforts from 1955 to 1957, these tasks were basically completed according to the requirements put forward. Although some shortcomings and mistakes, even serious ones, occurred in some work, from the main aspects, every work department has achieved significant results, and as a result, the nature of the revolution turning to the socialist road has become increasingly prominent.
　　At the Eighth Session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held in April this year, President Ho Chi Minh pointed out: "The Party and the Government believe that since the restoration of peace, North Vietnam has shifted from the stage of national and people's democratic revolution to the stage of socialist revolution." Comrade Truong Chinh's report at the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front in March this year and Prime Minister Pham Van Dong's report to the National Assembly on April 16, 1958, all elaborated on the main aspects of this transformation. Under the light of these documents, the people of North Vietnam are advancing towards socialism with greater confidence.
　　The National Economy is Advancing by Leaps and Bounds
　　Due to breaking away from imperialist rule and completing land reform, the economy of North Vietnam broke the economic foundation of colonialism and eliminated the feudal system of land ownership. In the process of economic recovery, thanks to the entire people correctly following the policies of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, coupled with the generous and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries, production has continued to rise, and the total output value of industry and agriculture has increased year by year. Especially in agriculture, the total output of rice in 1955 was 3,604,000 tons, greatly exceeding the pre-war 2,407,000 tons in 1939. By 1956, the total output of rice had increased to 4,132,000 tons. In 1957, despite severe natural disasters, the total output of rice still exceeded 50% of that in 1939. Of particular importance is the increase in yield per unit area. In 1939, the average yield per hectare was 1,320 kg, while in 1957 it reached 1,800 kg. In this way, our grain problem—which the French colonialists believed was impossible for North Vietnam to solve—has been solved, and its foundation is becoming more consolidated day by day. In addition, development has also been achieved in planting technical crops and exploiting forest products to ensure the supply of industrial raw materials and export goods.
　　In terms of industry, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has restored and expanded 32 enterprises and built 53 new enterprises. Not only can the newly built enterprises produce some commodities that used to be imported from foreign countries, but in some of the old enterprises that have just resumed production, some factories have quickly exceeded the pre-war level of 1939 in terms of output. For example, the production of the textile industry has exceeded 35.6% of that in 1939. The vast majority of private industries and handicrafts that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have been restored and developed, and the output of many industries has exceeded the pre-war period.
　　The commercial sector has stabilized prices. The transportation sector has repaired 657 kilometers of railways, rebuilt 3,284 kilometers of highways, and built 592 kilometers of new highways. In the reconstruction and construction of various projects, basic construction, water conservancy, and other departments have completed their tasks at a speed that was impossible under the old system.
　　Expansion of Socialist Factors
　　The above achievements are inseparable from the significant changes in the economic structure. Over the past four years, socialist factors have grown day by day and have effectively played their leading role. In rural areas, although the movement of mutual aid and cooperation in labor slowed down for a while due to errors in land reform, it has experienced new development after the basic completion of the rectification work. As of the end of 1957, a total of 44 agricultural production cooperatives with 647 households, 169 supply and marketing cooperatives with 1,238,000 members, 230 credit cooperatives with 142,800 members, and 100,600 mutual aid teams with 30% of the total number of farming households participating have been established in North Vietnam. In addition, 16 state-owned farms have been established. In industry, the proportion of socialist components is expanding. In 1957, the output of state-owned industry accounted for 24.4% of the total output of industry and handicrafts, and this proportion has now increased to 31%. In commerce, the proportion of state-owned components in wholesale was 36% and retail was 24.6% in 1955, and by 1957, wholesale accounted for 61% and retail accounted for 29.7%. The number of state-owned stores in 1957 doubled compared to 1955. The initial forms of state capitalism and the phenomenon of handicraft cooperation are also appearing more and more.
　　The achievements in production and the gradual changes in the economic structure have provided North Vietnam with the conditions to enter a new period of economic construction in accordance with a long-term plan—starting with the three-year (1958-1960) plan.
　　Achievements in Cultural Undertakings and Improvement of People's Lives
　　In the cultural field, the people of North Vietnam have also achieved good results on the road to socialism. The state has established six universities and many ten-year ordinary schools, as well as thirteen secondary vocational schools. The number of students has greatly increased compared with before the August Revolution: in the 1939-1940 academic year, there were a total of 541,000 students in ordinary schools and 1,020 college students, while in the 1957-1958 academic year, the number of students in ordinary schools increased to 1,008,000 and the number of college students increased to 12,000. The mass literacy movement, as an important part of the cultural revolution, has reached the point where it can basically eliminate illiteracy in North Vietnam this year. The health care sector has also made great progress. By the end of this year, there will be an average of one hospital bed for every 673 people. From 1955 to 1957, the number of senior medical personnel increased by nearly 80%, and the number of intermediate medical personnel increased by more than 80%. In particular, education on hygiene and disease prevention for the general public has become more and more common.
　　The lives of the working people have been gradually improved. From 1955 to 1957, the average consumption of meat, fish, cloth, and paper increased every year. Since the restoration of peace, the problem of employment for 140,000 unemployed workers and urban laborers caused by the French occupation period has been solved. The government has also taken three measures to increase the wages of employees, and recently made some rational reforms to the wage system, which has resulted in an average increase of 13% in employees' wages.
　　Victory on the Ideological Front
　　After four years of struggle in the new revolutionary stage, the people of North Vietnam have become increasingly aware that moving towards socialism is a process of long-term and arduous struggle. This is especially true at present, when the motherland is still temporarily divided into two regions with opposing systems, and the tasks of the national and people's democratic revolution have not yet been completed nationwide. However, the people of North Vietnam are also increasingly aware that only by taking the road of socialism can the strength of North Vietnam be strengthened, using it as a pillar to defend Vietnam's peace and as a foundation for realizing a unified motherland.
　　Over the past few years, in the process of revolutionary advancement, through continuous struggle, socialist ideology has achieved preliminary but decisive victories, especially after the struggle against the "Humanist-Fine Arts" destructive group from 1956 to the recent period. The "Humanist-Fine Arts" group was a collection of Trotskyites, counter-revolutionaries, reactionary elements of the bourgeoisie, and American Ngo Dinh Diem secret agents. They took advantage of the errors that occurred in our land reform work and some deviations in the issue of opposing the personality cult to carry out activities on a large scale. They spread the rhetoric of modern revisionism, combined theoretical weapons and literary tools, distorted social contradictions, and attempted to concentrate the spearhead of the people's struggle on the leadership of the Party. They put forward some bourgeois democratic arguments to deceive the masses, opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat, and opposed the socialist revolution. However, they could not undermine the people's boundless love for the beautiful system, the fruits of the revolution, and the pioneering Party. The people thoroughly exposed their true colors.
　　After conducting a series of socialist education among the broad masses of the people, cadres, party members, and basic masses were able to gradually recognize the path to socialism. In studying the two declarations of the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties, closely linked to the actual situation in Vietnam, a profound criticism of the essence of the "Humanist-Fine Arts" group was launched, which helped many people, especially many intellectuals and young people, to a certain extent, to realize the fundamental difference between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, and the fundamental difference between scientific socialism and revisionism or right-leaning opportunism. Subsequently, the struggle against the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia made many people further and more comprehensively recognize these issues. In short, an important transformation has taken place in the thinking of the broad masses of the people, and this transformation will promote a new progress that meets the requirements of the socialist revolution.
　　Moving Forward Steadily and Resolutely Completing Tasks
　　On the basis of the great achievements made in all aspects, the Vietnamese people are now launching a competition to complete the 1958 national plan, the first year of the three-year plan. After the National Congress of Heroes and Model Workers in Industry, Agriculture and the Army (July 1958), the enthusiasm of workers and farmers has become even higher. Tens of thousands of workers are striving to realize the slogan of "more, faster, better, and more economical," millions of farmers are enthusiastically participating in mutual aid teams, and tens of thousands of intellectuals are working diligently in their posts or going deep into reality with the workers and peasants to serve production practically, while consolidating their revolutionary stand and improving their ideological understanding through actual struggle.
　　Under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, relying on their own rich experience and constantly learning from the valuable experience of the world communist and workers' movement, the people of North Vietnam are increasingly clear about the road to a happy future. With the support of the people in the South who are persevering in their struggle, in the context of the Soviet Union moving towards communism and China's great leap forward, and encouraged by the brilliant achievements made by fraternal countries in the cause of building socialism and defending world peace, they are holding high the victorious banner of the glorious August Revolution and moving forward steadily.

　　越南北方人民正在向社会主义道路前进
    ——为越南民主共和国成立十三周年而作
    越南  光淡
    越南劳动党自成立的那一天起，就明确地提出了越南革命将引导人民走向社会主义。这一主张的精神，在民族、人民民主革命阶段中，在艰苦的抗战时期，就已经在一些具体的任务中体现出来了。
    反抗法国殖民者和美国干涉者的战争，以奠边府战役和1954年日内瓦会议恢复越南和平的辉煌胜利结束了，越南北方获得了完全的解放。从此，在半个越南的土地上，越南人民在越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，积极地完成了土地改革、恢复经济、医治战争创伤、发展已经出现的社会主义因素、在各个战线上逐步建立和扩大社会主义的基础、并开始实行有步骤的社会主义改造。经过1955年到1957年三年的努力，这些任务基本上按照所提出的要求完成了。虽然在某些工作中曾出现过一些缺点和犯了一些错误，甚至有些是严重的错误，但是从主要的方面来看，每一工作部门都取得了重大的成绩，其结果使革命转向社会主义道路的性质，日益显著起来。
    在今年4月间召开的越南民主共和国国会第八次会议上，胡志明主席指出：“党和政府认为，自从和平恢复以后，我国北方就由民族、人民民主革命的阶段转入了社会主义革命的阶段。”长征同志在今年3月越南祖国战线中央委员会扩大会议上所作的报告和范文同总理在1958年4月16日向国会作的报告中，对这一转变的主要方面都作了阐述。在这些文件的光芒照耀下，越南北方人民更加满怀信心地向社会主义前进。
    国民经济阔步前进
    由于摆脱了帝国主义统治和完成了土地改革，越南北方的经济便打破了殖民主义的经济基础和消灭了土地的封建占有制度。在恢复经济的过程中，由于全体人民正确地遵照越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的政策，加上苏联、中国以及其他兄弟国家的慷慨无私的援助，生产获得不断高涨，工农业总产值年年增长。特别是在农业方面，稻谷总产量1955年为三百六十万四千吨，大大超过了战前1939年的二百四十万七千吨。到1956年，稻谷的总产量又增加到四百一十三万二千吨。1957年，尽管遭受到严重的天然灾害，但是稻谷的总产量仍然超过1939年的50％。特别重要的是单位面积产量的提高，1939年平均每公顷产一千三百二十公斤，1957年则达到一千八百公斤。这样，就使得我们的粮食问题——这是法国殖民者认为越南北方不可能解决的问题——得到了解决，而且它的基础一天比一天巩固。此外，在种植技术作物和开采林产以保证工业原料的供给和出口物资方面，也获得了发展。
    工业方面，越南民主共和国恢复和扩建了三十二个企业，建设了五十三个新企业。不仅新建的企业能够生产出若干过去要从外国进口的商品，就是在刚恢复生产不久的旧企业中，有的工厂很快便在产量方面超过了战前1939年的水平。例如纺织业的生产已超过1939年的35.6％。绝大部分有利于国计民生的私营工业和手工业均得到恢复和发展，而且有许多行业的产量已超过战前时期。
    商业部门平稳了物价。交通运输部门修复了六百五十七公里铁路，重修公路三千二百八十四公里和新筑公路五百九十二公里。基本建设、水利等部门在重修和新建各项工程中，以在旧制度下不可能有的速度完成了各项任务。
    社会主义因素扩大
    以上这些成就同经济结构的具有重要意义的改变是分不开的。四年来，社会主义的因素一天天地增长，并且有效地发挥了它的领导作用。在农村，变工互助、合作化运动虽然由于土改工作中的错误而一度发展缓慢，但是在纠偏工作基本完成之后就又有了新的发展。截至1957年底为止，全越南北方已建立农业生产合作社四十四个，共六百四十七户；供销合作社一百六十九个，共有社员一百二十三万八千人；信贷合作社二百三十个，共有社员十四万二千八百人；变工互助组十万零六百个，参加人数占农户总数的30％。此外，还建立了十六个国营农场。在工业中，社会主义成份所占的比重日益扩大，1957年国营工业产量占工业和手工业总产量的24.4％，目前这个比例已增加到31％。在商业中，国营成份所占的比重1955年批发占36％，零售占24.6％，到1957年批发已占61％，零售占29.7％。1957年国营商店比1955年增加了一倍。国家资本主义的初级形式和手工业合作化现象也出现的愈来愈多了。
    在生产方面所获得的成就和经济结构的逐渐改变，就为越南北方提供了条件，使它有可能进入按照长期计划——以三年（1958—1960年）计划为开始——来进行经济建设的新的时期。
    文化事业的成就和人民生活的改善
    在文化领域，越南北方人民在向社会主义迈进的道路上也取得很好的成绩。国家建立了六所大学和许多十年制的普通学校，以及十三所中等专业学校。学生人数比八月革命以前大大地增加了：1939—1940学年普通学校学生共有五十四万一千多人，大专学生共有一千零二十人，到1957—1958学年，普通学校学生增至一百万零八千多人，大专学生一万二千多人。作为文化革命一个重要环节的平民教育运动，已经达到能够在今年内基本上在越南北方消灭文盲。卫生事业也获很大的发展，到今年底可达到平均每六百七十三人有一张病床。从1955年到1957年，高级医务人员增加了近80％，中级医务人员增加80％以上。特别是向广大人民群众进行清洁卫生、预防疾病的教育，已愈来愈普遍。
    劳动人民的生活已经得到逐步改善。从1955年到1957年，人们对肉类、鱼类、布匹、纸张的平均消费量每年都有增加。自和平恢复后至今，解决了法军占领时期造成的十四万失业工人和城市劳动者的就业问题。政府并且采取了三次提高职工工资的措施，不久前又对工资制度作了一些合理改革，这就使得职工的工资较前平均增长了13％。
    思想战线上的胜利
    经过四年来在新的革命阶段中的奋斗，越南北方人民日益清楚地看到走向社会主义是长期艰苦斗争的过程。特别是在目前，在祖国还暂时被分割成具有相对立的两种制度的南北两个地区、民族和人民民主革命的任务还没有在全国范围内完成的这种情况下，更是如此。但是，越南北方人民也愈来愈清楚地认识到，只有走社会主义的道路才能够加强越南北方的力量，以它作为保卫越南和平的支柱，作为实现统一祖国的基础。
    几年来，在革命向前发展的道路上，经过不断的斗争，社会主义思想已经取得了初步而带决定性的胜利，特别是经过从1956年开始到最近的反对“人文—佳品”破坏集团的斗争以后。“人文—佳品”集团是托洛茨基分子、反革命分子、资产阶级的反动分子和美国吴庭艳特务集合起来的。他们借我们在土地改革工作中发生了一些错误和在反对个人崇拜问题上出现的某些偏差的机会，大肆活动。他们散布现代修正主义的论调，用理论武器和文艺工具相结合，歪曲社会的矛盾，企图把人民群众的斗争矛头集中向党的领导，提出一些资产阶级民主的论调来欺骗群众，反对无产阶级专政，反对社会主义革命。但是，他们不可能破坏人民群众对美好的制度，对革命的成果，对起先锋作用的党的无限热爱。人民群众彻底揭穿了他们的真正面目。
    经过对广大人民进行了一系列社会主义教育以后，使得干部、党员和基本群众能够逐渐地认清了走向社会主义的道路。在学习各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议两个宣言当中，密切地联系到越南的实际情况，掀起了一个对“人文—佳品”集团的本质的深刻批判，这帮助了许多人，特别是许多知识分子和青年，使他们在一定程度上认识到无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想的根本区别，科学社会主义同修正主义或右倾机会主义之间的根本区别。继之，反对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领的斗争，更使许多人进一步深刻而全面地认清了这些问题。总之，广大人民的思想上已发生了一个重要转变，这个转变将推动一个适应社会主义革命要求的新的进步。
    稳步向前迈进，坚决完成任务
    在各方面取得了伟大成就的基础上，越南人民现在正为完成三年计划第一年的1958年国家计划而展开竞赛。在全国工农兵英雄模范大会（1958年7月）之后，工人和农民的劳动热情更加高涨。几万名工人正在努力实现“多快好省”的口号，几百万农民正在热烈参加变工互助组，几万脑力劳动者正在自己的工作岗位上或深入实际同工农群众一起，努力切实地为生产服务，同时通过实际斗争来巩固自己的革命立场和提高思想认识。
    越南北方人民在越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，依靠自己的丰富经验并且不断学习世界共产主义和工人运动的宝贵经验，日益认清了走向幸福的将来的道路。他们在南方人民坚持斗争的支援下，在苏联向共产主义迈进和中国大跃进形势下，在各兄弟国家在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平事业中所取得的辉煌成就的鼓舞下，正在高举着光辉的八月革命的胜利旗帜，稳步向前迈进。
