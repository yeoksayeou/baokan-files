Xinhua News Agency, September 25th - The China Association for Science and Technology, marking the broad unity of scientific and technological workers in our country and the mass technological revolution movement advancing on an even larger scale, was established in Beijing today.

This new national unified scientific and technological organization is formed by the merger of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and the All-China Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology. The decision to merge the aforementioned two organizations was made by the national congress of the Science Federation and the Science Popularization Association, which is also the first national congress of the China Association for Science and Technology.

The Science Federation and Science Popularization Congress opened in Beijing on September 18th and successfully concluded this afternoon.

According to the resolution of the congress, the China Association for Science and Technology is a socialist, national mass organization of science and technology under the leadership of the Party, a powerful tool and assistant for the Party to mobilize the vast scientific and technological workers and the broad masses of the people to carry out technical and cultural revolutions, and to build socialism and communism.

The resolution emphasizes that it is necessary to accept the leadership of the Party, conscientiously implement the policy of simultaneously emphasizing the central and local authorities, combining indigenous and foreign methods, combining science and technology with production practice, combining intellectuals with workers and peasants, combining mental and physical labor, and combining popularization and improvement.  The organizations of the Science Association at all levels must, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, carry out mass scientific and technological activities oriented towards production in a vigorous manner. The resolution also calls on everyone to wage unremitting struggle against all bourgeois ideas that deviate from the leadership of the Party, deviate from reality, deviate from the masses, and blindly believe in foreign countries and authorities, so that our country's scientific undertakings will leap forward with unprecedented scale and speed with the support of the broad masses of the people.

The congress also elected a 149-member National Committee (with one seat reserved for Tibet) as the leading body of the China Association for Science and Technology. The National Committee elected Li Siguang as Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, and Liang Xi, Hou Debang, Zhu Kezhen, Wu Youxun, Ding Xilin, Mao Yisheng, Wan Yi, Fan Changjiang, Ding Ying, and Huang Jiasi as Vice Chairmen. Yan Jici, Chen Jizu, Zhou Peiyuan, Tu Changwang, Xia Kangnong, and Nie Chunrong were elected as Secretaries of the Secretariat.

Ma Tongyi, a peasant from Changge County, Henan, who pioneered deep plowing of land; Li Shimei, an expert in termites; Lai Jinyan, a student from Tsinghua University who designed a radio transmitting steel tower reaching the world's advanced level; Zhang Qiuxiang, a cotton-planting expert from Shaanxi who helped others catch up with a communist spirit; Cao Yixiu, a Dai ethnic woman from Yunnan who is a rat-catching expert; Liao Shigang, a young worker and technical innovator from Chongqing; and Jiang Shaofang, a young man from Guangxi who boldly experimented with distant hybridization of rice and sorghum, were all elected as members of the National Committee of the Science Association.

The congress passed the "Resolution on Responding to the Call of the Party Central Committee to Strive to Fulfill the Twelve-Year Science and Technology Plan Five Years Ahead of Schedule" and the "Resolution on Launching the Science and Technology Gift-Giving Movement for the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the Country and Preparing to Convene the National Representative Meeting of Activists in Scientific and Technological Inventions and Creations"; at the same time, it also passed a statement protesting against the war provocations of US imperialism against our country.
