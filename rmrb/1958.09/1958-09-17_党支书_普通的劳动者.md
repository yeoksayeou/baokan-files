    Party Branch Secretary – An Ordinary Laborer
    In order to support the industrial construction in the mountainous areas, we came to the construction site of the First Engineering Team of the Jilin Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau. On the first day, everyone plunged into intense labor. The weather on Changbai Mountain is unpredictable, and suddenly the wind rises, the clouds surge, thunder rumbles, and torrential rain pours down.
    After we ran into the tent, everyone was soaked like drowned chickens. At this time, a comrade, about forty years old, walked in from the outside, looking like an ordinary worker. He carried a bundle of dry firewood, busied himself lighting the stove, and then went out to fetch a bucket of boiling water, pouring a cup for each of us. He also said to everyone kindly, "Comrades, you must have suffered from the rain! Come and warm yourselves by the fire, and drink a cup of boiling water to warm up!" After speaking, he hurried to another tent.
    In the evening, the rain stopped. Section Chief Liu of the Third Work Section called everyone to a meeting, saying that they would listen to the report of the Party Branch Secretary. We came to a meeting room built with straw curtains and branches. After Section Chief Liu announced the meeting, he invited Secretary Hao to make a report. Then, Secretary Hao walked to the front. I saw that he was the same person who had started the stove and poured the boiling water for us earlier. I listened attentively to his report, and on the way back, I couldn't stop thinking about his exemplary actions.

    党支书——普通的劳动者
    为了支援山区工业建设，我们来到吉林省森林工业管理局第一工程队工地。头一天，大家便投入了紧张的劳动。长白山上风雨无常，忽然风起云涌，雷声隆隆，倾盆大雨直泻下来。
    我们跑进帐篷以后，个个淋得像落汤鸡一样。这时，从外边走进一个年约四十岁的同志，看来是个普通工人。他抱着一捆干柴，忙着点起火炉，随后又出去打来一桶开水，给我们每个人倒了一杯。他还对大家亲切地说：“同志们，淋得够受吧！来烤烤火，喝一杯开水，取取暖吧！”说完以后，就匆匆地跑到另一个帐篷去了。
    傍晚，雨停了。第三工段刘段长喊大家去开会，说是听党支部书记报告。我们来到一所用草帘和树枝搭成的会议室。刘段长宣布开会以后，请郝书记作报告。接着，郝书记走到前边来。我一看，原来正是方才给我们生火炉、倒开水的人。我聚精会神地听完了他的报告，回去的路上，还念念不忘他的模范行动。
