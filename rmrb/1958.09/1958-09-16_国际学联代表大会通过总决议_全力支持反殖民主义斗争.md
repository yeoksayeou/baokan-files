Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The Fifth Congress of the International Student Union (ISU), held in Beijing, victoriously concluded at 10:30 AM today.

The final session of the congress began at 10:30 AM on the 14th and continued for twenty-four hours. Late into the night, while most people were sound asleep, student representatives and observers from around the world were still enthusiastically discussing issues of mutual concern. This morning, as the bright sunlight streamed into the conference hall, the representatives and observers were even more invigorated.

The congress unanimously adopted the "General Resolution on Anti-Colonialism." The resolution pointed out that the worldwide struggle against colonialism and for national independence is the most important characteristic of the international student movement. The resolution strongly condemned the heinous crimes of the colonialists and warmly congratulated the great victories achieved by students and people in various countries in the struggle against colonialism in recent years. The resolution stated that the congress guarantees full support for the struggle of students and people to win national independence, and declares that the anti-colonialism struggle is one of the foundations of international student cooperation. No national or international student organization can ignore or stand aside from the anti-colonialism movement. The congress called on all national and international student organizations to strengthen their actions in support of the student anti-colonialism struggle; and expressed its belief that these joint actions will unite students from all countries in peace and friendship.

The congress also adopted a series of specific recommendations, firmly supporting the just struggles of the people and students in many countries and regions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for national independence.

The congress strongly protested the US imperialists' support of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's criminal acts of shelling the Chinese mainland and bombing students at Xiamen University.

The congress also passed a resolution paying tribute to the vigorously developing student movements in Latin American countries, calling on students and people in Latin American countries to unite and wage a resolute struggle against colonial oppression and traitorous dictatorial rule. The resolution expressed that the ISU will give full support to the struggle of Latin American students and people against colonialism and for national independence.

In its "Resolution on the Development of the International Student Movement, the Contribution of the ISU and Student Organizations in Defending Student Interests and Promoting International Student Cooperation," the congress pointed out that the breadth and representativeness of the congress participants demonstrate the growth of the ISU and its fruitful contributions to the development of broad international student cooperation in the past two years. The resolution called on all students and their organizations around the world to take effective steps to make meaningful contributions to mutual understanding and friendship among students, to the defense of peace, and to the promotion of students' interests and aspirations.

By 10:30 AM today, all the resolutions of the congress had been adopted. Bellikane then spoke in a very enthusiastic and excited tone. He said that thanks to the willingness of all the representatives to cooperate with us, we have finally successfully completed the tasks scheduled for the congress, which is a good omen. Bellikane emphasized that this congress is an important event in the international student movement, and the congress has clearly stated our attitude and aspirations. Although the representatives come from different countries, have different experiences, and different ideas, everyone, representing students from many countries, has once again affirmed the basic principles of the ISU, and is willing to defend these principles, and is willing to promote cooperation among students from all countries. This is a great encouragement for our future work. Bellikane hoped that the representatives would transform the energy shown at the congress into the power to implement the congress resolutions, and strive to make contributions to peace and the development of friendship among students from all countries.

After Bellikane's speech, all the representatives stood up, first clapping rhythmically and enthusiastically for a long time, and then tightly held hands and sang the joyful and solemn anthem of the International Student Union in dozens of different languages, warmly celebrating the further great unity of students around the world and congratulating the successful conclusion of the congress. With this, the Fifth Congress of the International Student Union, which lasted twelve days, declared its victorious conclusion.

Further report: In the afternoon of the 15th, Premier Zhou Enlai attended the grand reception held by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, to celebrate the closing of the ISU Congress, and delivered a speech at the reception. Premier Zhou said to the student representatives from all countries: You all know that youth are the future and hope of the world. You represent the youth of the world in issuing a just call, and we are happy to see the future and hope of the world in you. (Attached picture)
