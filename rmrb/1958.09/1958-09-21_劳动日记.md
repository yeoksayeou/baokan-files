Labor Diary
Editor's Note: A class from Tsinghua University, during their labor in the school-run local electric plant, outstandingly completed their production tasks and were repeatedly praised by the leaders of the construction site. The students gained rich ideological rewards. The following are excerpts from their "Labor Diary," written in rotation.

July 31st　Coming back from labor, I received another letter from my younger brother. This is already the sixth letter from home urging me to return to Jinan. The letter says, "You don't miss me, but I miss you!" What to do? "... Even if you come back for one or two days, it would be good. ... Mother is sick with worry, come back, sister!"

Labor and going home, family and school, relatives and comrades... all this stirred up waves in my mind. But the Party's teachings echoed in my ears: Spend a communist summer vacation, be an ordinary laborer.... Finally, I replied: "Give up that thought, I'm not going back!" "I'm telling you the meaning of holiday labor... no force can pull me away from the furnace of labor."

August 13th　Every day, the work is always heavy and light, dirty and clean. Which one should I choose? There is struggle involved. Today, we were demolishing the toilet on the construction site of the local electric plant. The stones were smelly and hard, and sometimes sticky inside. At the time, I thought: Should I shovel soil or pick up the smelly and hard manure bricks? In an instant, I remembered the Party's teachings: When you no longer think of the laboring people as dirty, smelly, and stupid, then you can be considered transformed, laboring-people-ized. So, I resolutely used the hands I used to think were "clean" to pick them up...

August 15th　Today, labor at the construction site was very intense. The number of carts transporting materials doubled compared to usual, but the labor force did not increase. In the past, two or three people loaded a cart, but today there was only one or two. One person had to do the work of two. But the task was completed very well, basically without any disconnect, ensuring timely supply of materials. Our soaring labor enthusiasm was praised by the masters and the farmers driving the carts: "Good, great, what we need are college students who listen to the Party and are loyal to the people. ..."

August 30th　Today, supporting the water absorption well project, although it was the first time working continuously for six hours, I didn't feel very tired. Looking at the increasingly steep curve on the blackboard newspaper next to me, I felt even more relaxed and energetic. In just four hours, we completed two-thirds of the project.

But what encouraged us even more was the selfless labor enthusiasm of the masters. They started going down the well in shifts from 5:30 in the morning, half-immersed in the icy well water, fighting against the quicksand. When they came up from the bottom of the well, their faces were frozen purple. But after drinking a few sips of wine and resting for a while, they went back to work at the bottom of the well. - This is the model for us to learn from.

September 6th　Every day the newspaper is like a messenger of good news, bringing sweet dew: People's communes are born, the yield of intermediate rice exceeds 50,000 catties per mu, and this year's steel production will increase to 10.7 million tons. ...

But American imperialism is panicking. Dulles blatantly clamored for armed intervention in our internal affairs. When discussing the Premier's statement in the evening, the whole class was furious and immediately formed a combat platoon. From now on, we are students, workers, and soldiers. We must produce like we are fighting, and strike the American wolf!

### 劳动日记

    劳动日记
    编者按：清华大学的一个班，在学校办的土电厂的劳动中，出色地完成了生产任务，屡次受到工地领导的表扬。同学们思想收获丰硕。以下是他们轮流写的“劳动日记”中的一些片断。
    7月31日　劳动归来，又接到弟弟的来信。这已经是家里催我回济南的第六封信了。信上说：“你不想我，我还想你呢！”怎么办？“……那怕回来一、二天也好。……母亲想得病了，回来吧，姊姊！”
    劳动与回家，家庭与学校，亲人和同志……这一切在我脑海里掀起了波澜。但是党的教导在我耳边回响着：过共产主义的暑假，做一个平凡的劳动者……。终于回信了：“休了这个念头吧，我不回去！”“我把假期劳动的意义告诉你们……任何力量都不能把我从劳动的洪炉中吸走。”
    8月13日　每天的活总是有重、有轻，有脏、有净。自己挑那一份呢？里面就有斗争。今日拆土电厂工地上的厕所，石头又臭又硬，有时里面还粘呼呼的。当时自己想：去铲土还是捡又臭又硬的大粪砖呢？一瞬间，我想起了党的教导：当你不再认为劳动人民脏、臭、蠢时，那你就算改造好了，劳动人民化了。于是我就坚决用过去认为“干净”的双手去捡……
    8月15日　今天工地劳动非常紧张，运料的马车比平日猛增一倍，而劳动力却未增多。以往二、三个人装车，今日只有一、二个人，
  一个人要顶两个人的活。但是任务完成得非常出色，基本上没有脱节，保证了及时供料。我们高涨的劳动热情得到了师傅和赶马车的农民的夸奖：“好，真棒，我们需要的就是听党的话，对人民忠心耿耿的大学生。……”
    8月30日　今天支援吸水井工程，虽是第一次连续六小时劳动，但并不觉得十分累，看看旁边黑板报上愈来愈陡的曲线，心情更舒畅，干劲更猛。仅仅四小时，就完成了三分之二的工程量。
    但是更加鼓舞我们的是师傅们忘我的劳动热情。他们从清晨五时半起，就轮流下井，半身浸没在冰凉的井水里，与流沙搏斗，从井底上来时，脸冻得发紫，可是在饮过几口酒，休息片刻后，又重下井底工作。——这就是我们学习的榜样。
    9月6日　每天的报纸总像是报喜的天使，带来了甘露：人民公社诞生了，中稻亩产超过五万，今年的钢产量要提高到一千零七十万吨。……
    可是美帝国主义恐慌了，杜勒斯公然叫嚣武装干涉我国内政。晚上讨论总理声明时，全班都怒不可遏，立即成立了战斗排。从今后，我们是学生、工人，又是战士了，要像战斗那样来生产，打击美国狼！
