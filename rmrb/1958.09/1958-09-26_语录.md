    Quotations
    The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it. —Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach"
    The most distinctive feature of Marxist philosophical dialectical materialism is twofold: one is its class nature, openly declaring that dialectical materialism serves the proletariat; the other is its practicality, emphasizing the dependence of theory on practice, the foundation of theory is practice, and in turn serves practice.
    		     —Mao Zedong, "On Practice"
    The foundation of Marxism-Leninism is dialectical materialism. This worldview reflects the universal laws of development of nature, society, and human thought, and applies to the past, present, and future. The opposite of dialectical materialism is metaphysics and idealism. If a Marxist party does not observe problems from the point of view of dialectics and materialism, it will produce one-sidedness and subjectivism, which will make its thinking rigid and divorced from reality, and it will not be good at making appropriate analysis of things, it will make mistakes of revisionism or dogmatism, and it will make political mistakes. Applying dialectical materialism in actual work, and educating cadres and the broad masses with Marxism-Leninism, is one of the urgent tasks of the Communist Party and the Workers' Party.
                  —Declaration of the Moscow Meeting

    语录
    哲学家们只是用不同的方式说明过世界，而问题却在于要改变世界。——马克思“费尔巴哈论纲”
    马克思主义的哲学辩证唯物论有两个最显著的特点：一个是它的阶级性，公然申明辩证唯物论是为无产阶级服务的；再一个是它的实践性，强调理论对于实践的依赖关系，理论的基础是实践，又转过来为实践服务。
    		     ——毛泽东“实践论”
    马克思列宁主义的基础是辩证唯物论。这种宇宙观反映自然界、社会和人的思维的普遍发展规律，适用于过去、现在和将来。辩证唯物论的对立物是形而上学和唯心论。一个马克思主义的政党如果不用辩证法和唯物论的观点去观察问题，就会产生片面性和主观主义，就会使思想僵化和脱离实际，不善于对事物作恰当的分析，就会犯修正主义或者教条主义的错误，就会在政治上犯错误。在实际工作中运用辩证唯物论，用马克思列宁主义教育干部和广大群众，是共产党和工人党的迫切任务之一。
                  ——莫斯科会议宣言
