    Widely Plant Steel Experimental Fields
    When secretaries cultivate experimental fields, eating at the edge of the fields and sleeping at the edge of the fields, they can increase grain production. This is an important experience in this year's bumper agricultural harvest.
    Now, the Party's leadership focus has shifted to industry. The experimental fields of the secretaries of Party organizations at all levels must also "transfer their position." At present, this position is next to the blast furnace, next to the open hearth furnace, converter, and electric furnace, and next to the machine tools that manufacture metallurgical equipment. If the secretaries eat at the edge of the furnace and sleep at the edge of the furnace, they can increase steel production. When the secretaries of many Party organizations in Jiangsu Province went to the blast furnace, the daily output of pig iron in the province more than doubled.
    The leaders of Party organizations are always the "standard-bearers" running at the forefront, the people who hold the political "marshal's seal." Whichever front is the most important, they rush to that front. Wherever they go, the red flag is planted there, politics takes command there, and victory will surely be achieved there.
    Secretaries of Party organizations at all levels: set off immediately and widely plant steel experimental fields! In the last four months of this year, we must ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest of steel. Not a single ton less than 10.7 million tons of steel!

    广种钢铁试验田
    书记种试验田，吃到田边，睡到田边，就能增产粮食。这是今年农业丰产的一条重要经验。
    现在，党的领导重心转到工业方面来了。各级党组织的书记们的试验田也要“转移阵地”了。在目前，这个阵地就是高炉旁边，平炉、转炉和电炉旁边，制造冶金设备的机床旁边。书记吃到炉边，睡到炉边，就能增产钢铁。江苏省许多党组织的书记到了高炉旁边，全省的生铁日产量就增加了一倍多。
    党组织的领导者，永远是跑在最前面的“旗手”，是掌握政治“帅印”的人。那条战线最重要，他就奔赴那条战线，他去到那里，红旗就插在那里，政治就在那里挂帅，那里就一定能取得胜利。
    各级党组织的书记们：马上出发，广种钢铁试验田！在今年最后的四个月里，一定要保证钢铁全面丰收。一千零七十万吨钢，一吨也不能少！
