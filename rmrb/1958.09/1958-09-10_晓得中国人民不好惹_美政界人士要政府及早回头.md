Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Washington: The foolish behavior of the American authorities playing with fire near the Chinese coast has caused unease even among some figures in American political circles, who are demanding that the American authorities turn back early and not invite trouble.

Democratic Senator O'Mahoney, on the 8th, spoke about the provocative actions of American warships intruding into Chinese territorial waters and escorting Chiang Kai-shek's group's ships to Jinmen, effectively admitting that this action was an aggression against China. O'Mahoney said that the American government's action was "very dangerous" and that the provocative actions of American warships could invite the disaster of Chinese retaliation. He said he did not think Eisenhower could "take actions that, in the eyes of the people of the world, are acts of aggression" without consulting Congress.

The "New York Times" published a letter from former U.S. Air Force Secretary Thomas Finletter, which pointed out that "the U.S. government's playing with fire on Jinmen and Mazu islands is dangerous and unnecessary. President Eisenhower's statement through Secretary of State Dulles in Newport on September 4th is almost tantamount to saying that the United States will fight with Communist China... To insist that the defense of Jinmen and Mazu is necessary for the defense of the United States is an absurd argument."

The well-known American bourgeois commentator Walter Lippmann admitted in the "Washington Post" on September 4th that the current American armed provocation is "very isolated." He believes that if the United States dares to provoke a war, "not only will all non-aligned countries express regret and condemnation, but most of our (American) closer allies will also express regret and condemnation."

The "New York Post" said on the 8th, "The Eisenhower administration must realize that there is no popular support for the United States to wage atomic war on Jinmen and Mazu."

    晓得中国人民不好惹
　　美政界人士要政府及早回头
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国当局愚蠢地在中国海岸附近玩火的行为，甚至在美国政界一些人士中也引起不安，他们要求美国当局及早回头，不要惹火烧身。
    民主党参议员奥马洪尼8日谈到美国军舰侵犯中国领海、护送蒋介石集团的舰只到金门去的挑衅行动时实际上承认这个行动是对中国进行侵略。奥马洪尼说，美国政府这个行动是“非常危险的”，美国军舰的挑衅行动会招惹遭到中国反击的灾祸。他说，他并不认为艾森豪威尔可以未经同国会商量“就采取在世界人民看来是侵略行为的行动”。
    “纽约时报”刊载了美国前空军部长托马斯·芬勒特的一封信，信中指出，“美国政府在金门和马祖两岛玩弄战火是危险的，也是不必要的。艾森豪威尔总统9月4日通过国务卿杜勒斯在新港发表的声明几乎等于是说美国将同共产党中国作战……硬说金门和马祖的防御对美国的防御是必要的——这是荒谬的论调。”
    著名的美国资产阶级评论员李普曼在9月4日的“华盛顿邮报”上承认，美国目前的武装挑衅是
  “非常孤立”的。他认为，如果美国竟然胆敢挑起战争，“不仅所有不参加集团的国家将会表示遗憾和加以谴责，而且我们（美国）大多数比较紧密的盟国也会表示遗憾和加以谴责”。
    “纽约邮报”8日说，“艾森豪威尔政府必须认识到：美国在金门和马祖进行原子战争是没有人民支持的基础的”。
