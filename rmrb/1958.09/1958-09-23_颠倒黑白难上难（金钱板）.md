It is often said that trees need bark and people need face, and that nagging scolds are annoying. Dulles doesn't care about face, and he's talking nonsense in broad daylight, saying that Jinmen, Matsu, Taiwan, and Penghu are not under China's jurisdiction, and that we haven't exercised administrative power for nine years; saying that liberating Taiwan is an "act of aggression" that endangers world peace and security; saying that we must "cease fire" without delay, otherwise the United States will use its fists. Jinmen, Matsu, Taiwan, and Penghu have belonged to China since ancient times, and it is only natural for the Chinese people to liberate them. The so-called "ceasefire" is even more nonsense, distorting the facts and unreasonable! China is not at war with the United States, so where does the "ceasefire" problem come from?! The tense situation in the Taiwan region is entirely the responsibility of the United States. It is the United States that sent planes and warships, it is the United States that occupied our territory of Taiwan, it is the United States that helped the Chiang Kai-shek gang to make trouble, and it is the United States that is undermining world peace and security! Foreign Minister Chen Yi, representing the Chinese people, spoke with words as heavy as mountains, exposing Dulles's lies and deceptions, warning the aggressors not to play with fire again, demanding that the American armed forces must get out of Taiwan, and that China's internal affairs are none of the United States' business. If the United States wants to challenge us again and impose war on us, 600 million people will show great power, unite as one to defend our territorial sovereignty, bravely defend peace against aggression, and resolutely not tolerate giving the aggressors a blow! This is exactly:

　　Lies cannot deceive people,
　　It is hard to reverse black and white,
　　War-mongers want to take risks,
　　The people all raise their iron fists!

    颠倒黑白难上难（金钱板）
    天马常言说树要留皮人要脸，骂街的泼妇讨人嫌。杜勒斯他才不顾啥脸面，光天化日他就发胡言，说什么金马台澎不属中国管，九年来我们没有行使管理权；说什么解放台湾是进行“侵略战”，要危及世界和平与安全；说什么要我“停火”不得迟慢，要不然他美国就要动手挥拳。金马台澎自古就属中国管，中国人民解放它们是理所当然。所谓“停火”更是胡扯淡，歪曲事实他理不端！中国并没有与美国来交战，“停火”问题从何谈？！台湾地区形成了紧张局面，责任完全由你美国来承担。是你美国派来了飞机和军舰，是你美国侵占了我领土台湾，是你美国帮助蒋匪胡捣蛋，是你美国破坏世界和平与安全！陈毅外长代表中国人民把话谈，一字一句分量重如山，揭露了杜勒斯的谎言欺骗，警告侵略者莫再把火玩，美国武装力量必须从台湾滚蛋，中国的内政与你美国不相干。假如美国还要来挑战，把战争强加在我们头上边，六亿人民就要大把威风显，团结一致保卫我领土主权，反侵略保和平个个勇敢，给侵略者以打击决不容宽！这正是：
  谎言岂能把人骗，
  颠倒黑白难上难，
  战争贩子要冒险，
  人民个个举铁拳！
