The "Competition" of Two Roads
穆亥

The Beijing Petroleum Institute accepted the commission from Beijing People's Hospital to trial-produce four kinds of highly effective bactericides. Young teachers and students requested to participate in the trial production work of the professors, but the professors did not agree. Thus, a "competition" between teachers and students began: The professors strictly guarded against "leaks," shut themselves in, and "searched for treasures" in books. After two weeks, not even one highly effective bactericide had been trial-produced. Under the leadership and encouragement of the Party, the young people dared to think and dared to act, pooled their wisdom and efforts, and in only four and a half days, they produced all four highly effective bactericides.

The "competition" incident between teachers and students of the Petroleum Institute profoundly reflects the struggle between two methods in scientific research. The result of the professor's closed-door, individual work was few, slow, poor, and costly. After two weeks, not even one highly effective bactericide had been trial-produced. Under the leadership of the Party, relying on the strength of the collective, breaking the blind faith in literature, and not being afraid of failure, the young teachers and students spent only four and a half days to produce all four kinds of highly effective bactericides in a faster, better, more economical way. From this, it can be seen that the professor's individual work line is a line of few, slow, poor, and costly results; it is a path to failure. The young teachers and students' collective research line is a line of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and it is also a path to success.

Such dramatically rich stories have become commonplace recently, especially in the scientific and technological circles. If this were merely a matter of method, it would be relatively easy to resolve. Unfortunately, the roots of these events are very deep.

Originally, students surpassing teachers, later generations surpassing their predecessors, or "azure comes from indigo but is bluer than indigo," is a normal phenomenon of the development of things, and it is also an inevitable law. In societies ruled by the exploiting classes, despite the private ownership of knowledge, the monopolization of technology, and the separation of science from the working people, it could not escape this law. When the era entered socialist society, the sickle and axe opened the vermilion gates of knowledge monopolizers, and scientific and technological knowledge became the wealth of the entire people. Once science and technology are grasped by the broad masses of the people, it bursts forth with unparalleled power. This is not only manifested in the current great leap forward in science and technology itself, but also in the great changes in the relationships between people. Now, many advanced producers consciously help others catch up with the advanced and even surpass themselves, and some teachers consciously help students learn skills and even surpass themselves. Isn't this precisely the characteristic of our era? However, bourgeois intellectuals view their knowledge in the same way that capitalists view their means of production. To ask them to return their knowledge to the people and hope that they can enter socialist society together with the people is a huge struggle. The essence of the "competition" incident between teachers and students of the Petroleum Institute vividly depicts the clear picture of the struggle between capitalism and socialism in the field of science and technology. The professor regarded her little knowledge as private property. In her view, private property is, of course, inviolable. Therefore, she refused to trial-produce highly effective bactericides with the students, and on the medicines with labels bearing the names of the drugs, she replaced them with numbers "One" and "Two" that people could not understand. Capitalists have the desire to monopolize the market, and the professor's performance fully illustrates this point. Although the raging fire of the Double-Anti Movement burned away the individualism of many people, just as this professor also made a self-criticism after rectification, this does not mean that the issue of individual stance has been resolved. The struggle between the two roads continues. As the Chinese saying goes, "Observe their conduct after listening to their words." Whether the bourgeois intellectuals' stance has changed should be determined by their own actions.

The era of private ownership of knowledge and scientific monopoly is gone forever. Scientists should, under the leadership of the Party, follow the mass line, unite all forces that can be united, learn from the workers and peasants who have practical experience in production, cooperate with the young people in their own units, and cooperate with scientists outside their own units, and strive for the high-speed development of socialist science. If someone still wants to monopolize this position, no matter what kind of fortress they are defending, we should, like the young teachers and students of the Petroleum Institute, bravely and resolutely break it down! In our society, individualists always fail; collectivism is bound to win.

    两条道路的“竞赛”
    穆亥
    北京石油学院接受北京人民医院的委托试制四种高效杀菌剂。青年师生们要求参加教授的试制工作，教授不答应。于是师生之间的一场“竞赛”开始了：教授严防“泄密”，关门在书中“查宝”，两周过去了，一种高效杀菌剂还没试制出来；青年们在党的领导和鼓舞下，敢想敢干，群策群力，只用了四天半的时间，就把四种高效杀菌剂通统制成了。 
    石油学院师生“竞赛”事件，深刻地反映了在科学研究问题上的两种方法的斗争。教授闭门单干的结果，是又少又慢又差又费，花了两周的时间，还没有试制出一种高效杀菌剂；青年师生在党的领导下，依靠集体的力量，破除对文献的迷信，不怕失败，只花了四天半的时间，就多快好省地把四种高效杀菌剂全部制成了。由此可见，教授单干的路线，是少慢差费的路线，它是一条失败的路线。青年师生集体研究的路线，是多快好省的路线，也是一条成功的路线。
    这类颇富戏剧性的故事，近来已屡见不鲜，特别是在科学技术界。如果这仅仅是方法问题，那倒是比较容易解决的，可惜发生这类事件的根源是很深远的。
    本来，学生超过老师，后人越过前人，或者说“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”，原是事物发展的正常现象，也是必然的规律。在剥削阶级统治的社会里，尽管知识私有，技术独占，科学与劳动人民分离，但它也逃脱不了这个规律。时代进入社会主义社会，镰刀斧头打开了知识垄断者的朱红大门，科学技术知识成为全民的财富。而科学、技术一旦为广大的人民群众所掌握，它就迸发出无比的威力。这不但表现为目前科学技术本身的大跃进，而且表现为人们之间关系的大变革。现在很多先进生产者自觉地帮助别人赶上先进以至超过自己，有的老师自觉地帮助学生学得本领以至胜过自己，这不正是我们这个时代的特征吗？但是，资产阶级知识分子看待他们的知识，正如同资本家看待他们的生产资料一样，要他们把知识交还给人民并希望他们能够和人民一道进入社会主义社会，这是一场巨大的斗争。石油学院师生“竞赛”事件的实质，生动地刻划出在科学技术领域内资本主义还是社会主义这两条道路的斗争的鲜明景象。教授把她的那点知识看作私有财产，在她看来，私有财产当然是不能侵犯的。因此她拒绝同学生们一道试制高效杀菌剂，并且在写有药名标签的药品上，换上了叫人不能识透的一号二号的号码。资本家有独占市场的嗜欲，这位教授的表现，充分说明了这点。尽管双反运动的烈火猛烧了不少人的个人主义，正像这位教授也经过整风作过检讨一样，这并不等于解决了个人的立场问题，两条道路的斗争还在继续着。我们中国有句古话，“听其言而观其行”，资产阶级知识分子的立场是否有所转变，要让他自己的行动去给自己作出适当的结论。
    知识私有、科学独占的时代一去不复返了。科学家应该在党的领导下，走群众路线，团结一切可能团结的力量，向有生产实践经验的工农群众学习，和本单位的青年人合作，同本单位以外的科学家合作，为高速度发展社会主义的科学事业而奋斗。如果有人还要独霸这块阵地，不管他所坚守的是何种堡垒，我们都应该像石油学院青年师生那样，勇敢地坚决地攻破它！在我们这个社会里，个人主义者总是失败；集体主义一定胜利。
