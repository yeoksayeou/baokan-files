Basic Construction: Steel First!
All Enterprises in Tianjin Fully Support Steel Mill Expansion

(Our newspaper's Tianjin dispatch, 5th) The Tianjin Municipal Party and government leadership departments, following the spirit of the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, have made the greatest determination to ensure that this year's massive capital construction prioritizes key projects, especially ensuring the rapid completion of steel industry construction projects, and joining the national torrent striving to produce 10.7 million tons of steel as soon as possible.

With the surge in industrial and agricultural production, Tianjin's capital construction investment plan for this year exceeds the total of the past five years. From January to August, the completed projects have already seen investment exceeding the total for the entire last year by more than 50%. Among these, over eighty industrial construction units have been fully or partially put into production, averaging a new or expanded industrial unit every three days. However, a new situation emerged starting in June: the supply of the three major raw materials for capital construction—steel, wood, and cement—could not meet demand. In early August, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee studied this situation and immediately took measures to adjust the engineering projects according to their importance and urgency. Recently, after the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee determined the policy of "industrial production and construction must first guarantee key projects," the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee conducted another review, comprehensively categorizing the 922 capital construction projects currently underway. They resolved to divide them into three categories: The first category consists of sixteen key projects that must be guaranteed, including the expansion of Tianjin Steel Plant with eight large converters, the expansion of Emerging Steel Plant with two five-ton converters, and five steel industry projects such as the expansion of the refractory material plant. The other eleven projects are large-scale machinery industry and cement industry projects; the second category includes other key projects to be guaranteed and a batch of finishing projects requiring few materials, with special consideration given to units producing products needed by the countryside, such as rickshaw tires, pesticides, etc., as well as some newly built hospitals and middle and primary schools; the third category consists of general projects, which will give way to key projects, especially steel construction projects, by stopping work, reducing scale, slowing down progress, or suspending construction.

While categorizing the projects, the Tianjin leadership also took decisive measures to expand the manufacturing of metallurgical equipment and concentrate the use of building materials, so that the policy of guaranteeing key projects could be effectively implemented. Before the first categorization in early August, only twenty-odd machinery factories in the city were manufacturing smelting equipment for the expansion of Tianjin Steel Plant alone. After the categorization, the projects of Emerging Steel Plant and the refractory material plant were immediately brought to the forefront of the construction schedule, and the number of factories manufacturing smelting equipment was expanded to sixty-eight, producing a total of 136 types of equipment, 2,900 pieces. The equipment for other projects originally undertaken by these factories was all set aside. The Party organization of Tianjin Boiler Factory compressed its original boiler production tasks, designating the manufacture of metallurgical equipment, with its many varieties, large quantities, and urgent requirements, as the top political task, and contributed all of its steel originally intended for boiler production. The machine repair shop of Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory stopped its work on speeding up the textile machines of its own factory and accepted the task of processing six turbine reducers for the refractory material plant. However, because the processing castings could not be delivered in time, it was certain that the delivery could not be made on time. Therefore, the Tianjin Municipal Textile Bureau took the initiative to have two other factories stop some of their work to participate in expediting the production.

Recently, the Municipal Party Committee put forward new requirements, demanding that metallurgical equipment manufacturing be expanded once again, calling on all factories in the city that can produce well and quickly to propose their possible conditions, so as to concentrate even more effort on storming the steel construction projects.

Because all parties have implemented the policy of guaranteeing key projects, the civil engineering work for the first phase of the Tianjin Steel Plant expansion project—the most important of Tianjin's five steel industry construction projects this year—consisting of three large converters, was completed today (the 5th) 115 days ahead of schedule, and steel is expected to be produced on September 25th. The second phase of this factory's project and the other four steel construction projects will all be completed and put into production ahead of schedule in October and November of this year, shouldering the major part of the city's task of completing 500,000 tons of steel.

### 基本建设　钢铁第一  天津市各企业全力支援钢厂扩建

　　基本建设　钢铁第一
    天津市各企业全力支援钢厂扩建
    本报天津5日电　天津市党政领导部门根据中共中央政治局扩大会议的精神，下了最大的决心使今年规模巨大的基本建设首先保证重点，特别是保证钢铁工业建设项目的迅速完成，尽早投入全国为生产一千零七十万吨钢而奋斗的洪流。
    随着工农业生产的高涨，天津市今年的基本建设投资计划超过过去五年的总和。1至8月份累计，已经完成的项目其投资额就已经比去年全年还多50％以上，其中工业建设单位全部或部分投入了生产的已有八十多个，平均不到三天就出现一个新建或扩建的工业单位。但是，从6月份开始出现了一个新的情况，这就是基本建设的三大主要原材料：钢材、木材和水泥的供应不能满足需要。8月初，中共天津市委和市人民委员会研究了这一情况，当即采取措施，对工程项目按轻重缓急进行了调整。最近，中共中央政治局扩大会议确定了“工业的生产和建设必须首先保证重点”的方针以后，市委和市人民委员会又进行了排队，把目前已经动工的九百二十二个基建项目进行了全面排队，决心把它们分为三类：第一类是必须保证的主要重点项目有十六个，其中包括天津钢厂扩建八座大转炉，新兴钢厂扩建两座五吨转炉，和耐火器材厂的扩建等五项钢铁工业工程，另外十一项是大型机械工业和水泥工业等；第二类是争取保证的其他重点项目，以及一批需料不多的收尾工程，其中特别照顾到生产农村需要产品的，如力车胎、农药等单位，还有一些新建的医院和中、小学校；第三类是一般工程，当它们与重点工程特别是与钢铁建设项目有矛盾时，一律停车让路，紧缩规模，放缓速度或暂停施工。
    在进行工程排队的同时，天津市领导部门又采取了坚决的措施，扩大冶金设备的制造和集中建筑材料的使用，使保证重点的方针得以有效的贯彻。在8月初第一次排队以前，全市只二十几个机械工厂为天津钢厂一个扩建单位承制冶炼设备，排队后，把新兴钢厂和耐火器材厂的工程立即提到了建设日程的前头，于是把承制冶炼设备的工厂扩大到六十八个，共制各种设备一百三十六种，二千九百件。这些厂原来承制的其他工程的设备一律让路，天津锅炉制造厂党组织压缩了原来生产锅炉的任务，把品种多、数量大、要求急的冶金设备制造确定为头等政治任务，并把自己制造锅炉的钢材全部拿出来垫用。天津棉纺一厂机修车间把本厂纺织机加快转速的设备制造工作停下来，接受了耐火器材厂的六台涡轮减速机的加工任务，但由于加工铸件不能及时送到，肯定不能按时交件，于是，天津市纺织管理局又主动让另外两个厂停下一些工作参加赶制。
    最近，市委又提出了新的要求，要再一次扩大冶金设备的制造，号召全市凡能够造得好、造得快的厂都提出自己的可能条件，以更加集中力量突击钢铁建设工程。
    由于各方面贯彻了保证重点的方针，天津市今年五项钢铁工业建设项目中最主要的一项——天津钢厂扩建工程的第一期三座大转炉的土建工程，已在今天（5日）提前一百一十五天完成，预定9月25日就可出钢。这个厂的第二期工程和其他四项钢铁建设工程都将提前在今年10月和11月完成投入生产，负担起全市完成五十万吨钢的大部分生产任务。
