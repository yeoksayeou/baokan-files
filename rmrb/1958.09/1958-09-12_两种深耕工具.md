Two Deep Tillage Tools

    Hand-Lever Deep Tillage Walking Plow
    The hand-lever deep tillage walking plow was modified by Yang Xinke of Baqie Township, Tang County, Hebei Province, from a seven-inch walking plow. The modification principle of this plow is roughly the same as Wang Yushun's. The main parts of the modification are: adding a curved iron plow beam, a hoe-shaped soil loosening shovel, a soil loosening depth adjustment toothed plate, and an adjustment rod to the original plow. The front end of the curved plow beam is fixed to the middle of the wooden beam, and the middle is connected to the soil loosening depth toothed plate with a splint. The middle of the curved plow beam is also equipped with an adjustment rod to adjust the depth of the soil loosening shovel.
    The advantages of this plow are: the tillage depth can reach 46.2 cm, the soil loosening depth can be adjusted at will, the soil is turned evenly, and the raw soil will not be turned up. According to tests, with this plow, one person can operate it, drawn by two animals, and can deep plow four mu per day.
    Eight-Inch Double-Layer Deep Tillage Plow
    This was modified by Wang Yushun and five others from the Advanced First Agricultural Cooperative of Changge County, Henan Province, based on an eight-inch walking plow (No. 20 walking plow). This plow can generally reach 33 cm for deep tillage and subsoiling, with a maximum depth of 40 cm (1.2 feet). It can complete both plowing and subsoiling in one operation, so using it for deep tillage saves manpower, animal power, and farm tools compared to using old plows in tandem; it is more than ten times more efficient than manual digging. Another benefit is that the depth can be adjusted at will, so that raw soil does not mix into the topsoil layer.
    The modification method of this plow is: lengthen the plow beam of the eight-inch walking plow to 166 cm, and add a plowshare-type soil loosening shovel behind the plowshare, with a distance of 42 cm between the front and rear plow columns. This plow, because the front plow turns the soil and the rear shovel loosens the soil, with a clear division of labor, and the soil loosening shovel surface is smooth, the plow column is relatively thin, and the entry angle is 18 degrees, it can greatly reduce the pulling force, so that the compacted soil in the subsoil layer is crushed into small pieces without being turned to the upper layer.
    The technical group of the National Deep Tillage Implement Soil Improvement Conference tested and evaluated this plow and found that: the main plow has a tillage width of 22 cm, the subsoil shovel has a tillage depth of 10.5 cm, the total depth is 32.5 cm; the total pulling force is 259.7 kg.

    两种深耕工具
    手杆式深耕步犁
    手杆式深耕步犁是河北唐县拔茄乡杨新科用七吋步犁改装成的。这种犁的改装原理和王玉顺的大致相同。改装主要部分是：在原来的犁上增加了弯形铁质犁辕、锄形松土铲、松土深浅调节齿板和调节杆等。弯形犁辕前端固定在木辕中部，中间用一块夹板和松土深浅齿板连接。弯形犁辕中部还装有调节杆，以调节松土铲入土的深浅。
    这种犁的优点是：耕深能达到四十六点二公分，松土深度可以随意调节，翻土均匀，也不会把生土翻上来。据试验，用这犁一人操作，两头牲口牵引，每天可深翻四亩。
    八吋双层深耕犁
    这是河南长葛县先进第一农业社王玉顺等六个人根据八吋步犁（二十号步犁）改装成的。这种犁深耕和松心土一般能到三十三公分，最大深度为四十公分（一尺二寸），能一次完成犁土、松土两道工序，因此用它深耕比用旧犁套耕节省人力畜力和农具；比用人工挖的效率高十倍以上。它的另一好处是深度可以随意调节，能使生土不掺入熟土层。
    这种犁的改装方法是：把八吋步犁的犁辕加长到一百六十六公分，在犁头后面增加一个犁铧式松土铲，前后两个犁柱间的距离为四十二公分。这种犁由于前犁翻土，后铲松土，分工明确，再加松土铲铲面光滑，犁柱较细，入土角度为十八度，所以能大大减轻拉力，使心土层板结的土壤碎成小块，又不致翻到上层来。
    全国深耕农具土壤改良会议技术组对这种犁试验鉴定结果是：主犁耕宽二十二公分，心土铲耕深十点五公分，总深是三十二点五公分；总拉力是二百五十九点七公斤。（附图片）
