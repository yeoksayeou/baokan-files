Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: All able-bodied relief recipients in China's towns and cities have now achieved self-sufficiency through production. This is a tremendous change in China's urban landscape brought about by the high tide of the socialist construction Great Leap Forward.

The current situation is that, with the exception of a small number of completely incapacitated disabled persons and lonely elderly who are still cared for and relieved by the government, all able-bodied relief recipients in towns and cities have returned their relief cards to the government. They no longer need to rely on government relief funds for their living. The large amount of social relief work left over by the Kuomintang reactionary government has thus become a historical relic. Under this new situation, the state agencies managing relief work have also completed their historical mission and have been correspondingly transformed into agencies guiding social welfare work.

This situation shows that what no government of any exploiting class in history could do has been achieved today by the laboring people's own government. Nanjing, which once served as the center of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, was left with a heavy burden by the Kuomintang reactionary government at the time of liberation, with as many as 300,000 unemployed people. After liberation, the People's Government cared for the people in every possible way. Now, all these unemployed people have been employed, and relief recipients no longer need government relief. Not only is their livelihood guaranteed, but many have also acquired new clothes and furniture, significantly improving their living standards. Before liberation, Chongqing was rife with thieves and pickpockets, and there were unemployed vagrants everywhere. Now, social welfare production institutions have been established in every street and alley of the city, and idlers have all joined production. All relief recipients have become self-sufficient.

In small towns with underdeveloped industries, social welfare production has also developed rapidly, and relief recipients have also achieved self-sufficiency through production. Guancheng Town in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, was a place where poor people were concentrated before liberation. In the early days of liberation, the town had 1,842 poor households with 3,912 people, accounting for 41.7% of the town's total households. This year, no one in the town needs relief anymore. Now, there are no idle people on the streets, and no idle people in any household.

In the years since liberation, the consistent policy of the Party and the government has been to solve the livelihood problems of the poor through production. With the development of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production throughout the country, social welfare production has flourished everywhere. According to statistics, in the three months from May to July this year, more than 75,500 new social welfare production units were established in various places, a figure more than nine times the total number of social welfare production units established in various places in the past eight years.

Relief recipients have felt the warmth of the socialist family from their personal experiences. The change in their lives has also brought about a great change in their mental outlook. They sincerely support the leadership of the Communist Party and express their desire to contribute their share of effort. Once they have the opportunity to be employed, their enthusiasm for production is very high. In the Renfa Woolen Mill in the Hui Nationality District of Luohe City, Jing Xialiang, a double-leg amputee, wandered the streets begging in the old society. Now, he is working hard in production and has learned seven or eight techniques.

On the basis of the development of production, a surge in vigorously developing social welfare programs has arrived. Local authorities have already used the original relief funds for social welfare undertakings. The slogans put forward by towns and cities across the country are: to further leap towards towns and cities where everyone is prosperous, and to completely realize the great ideal of "the old being cared for until their death, the strong being employed, the young being nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, and disabled being provided for," which our people have aspired to for thousands of years.

    大跃进给城市面貌带来大变化
    救济户不再需要政府救济
    国家管理救济工作机关完成历史使命
    正大办社会福利事业使人人生活富裕
    据新华社28日讯  我国城镇中所有有劳动能力的救济户目前已经全部做到了生产自给。这是社会主义建设大跃进高潮带来的我国城市面貌的巨大变化。
    目前的情况是：全国城镇中除了一小部分完全丧失劳动能力的残废人和孤老人仍然得到政府负责的关怀和救济以外，所有有劳动能力的救济户已经把领取救济金的卡片全部退还给政府，他们已经不再需要依靠政府的救济金来生活了。国民党反动政府遗留下来的大量的社会救济工作，至此已成为历史陈迹；在这种新的形势下，国家管理救济工作的机构也已经完成了它的历史使命，相应地改变成为指导社会福利工作的机构。
    这种情况表明，历史上任何一个剥削阶级当权的政府所不可能做到的事情，今天在劳动人民自己的政府的手里做到了。曾经作为国民党反动统治中心的南京，解放时，国民党反动政府给人民丢下了一个大包袱，仅失业的人员就有三十万人。解放以后，人民政府处处关心人民，现在这些失业人员已全部劳动就业，救济户已不再需要政府救济，他们不仅生活有了保障，许多人并且添置了新衣，购买了家具，显著地提高了生活水平。解放前的重庆，小偷扒手充斥于市，到处是无业游民。现在，这个市的大街小巷都有了社会福利生产机构，游手好闲的人都参加了生产，救济户已全部成为自给户。
    在工业不发达的小城镇里，社会福利生产也飞跃发展，救济户也都作到了生产自给。湖北省孝感县城关镇在解放前是贫民集中的地方，解放初期这个镇遗留下来的贫民有一千八百四十二户，三千九百一十二人，占全镇总户数的41.7％；今年全镇所有的人都不需要救济了，现在是街街无闲人，户户无闲人。
    解放后几年来，党和政府一贯的方针是，通过生产来解决贫民的生活问题。随着全国工农业生产大跃进形势的发展，社会福利生产更是遍地开花。据统计，在今年5月到7月的三个月中，各地新建的社会福利生产单位有七万五千五百多个，这个数字相当于各地八年来所建立的社会福利生产单位总数的九倍多。
    救济户从亲身的体验中感到了社会主义大家庭的温暖。生活的改变，使他们的精神面貌也有了很大的改变。他们竭诚拥护共产党的领导，而且表示要有一分热发一分光。一旦有了就业的机会，他们的生产情绪都非常高涨。洛阳市?河回族区的社会福利人发毛线制品厂里，有一个双腿残废的人景下亮，他在旧社会流落街头，沿街乞讨，现在参加生产很努力，已经学会了七、八种技术。
    在生产发展的基础上，大力兴办社会福利事业的热潮已经到来。各地已经把原来的救济款用于兴办福利事业的工作上。各地城镇提出的口号是：要进一步向人人富裕的城镇跃进，彻底实现我国人民几千年来的“老有所终、壮有所用、幼有所长、鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”的伟大理想。
