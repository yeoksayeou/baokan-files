　　“Big Intellectuals” Passing the Cultural Test
    Ya Qun

　　It’s really a bit of a "mess," to put it mildly. Some bourgeois "big intellectuals" thought that with the arrival of the cultural and technological revolution, they would be the ones in charge, and that the proletarian "small intellectuals" would definitely be out of their depth and would have to rely on them.

    However, the facts stubbornly contradicted these gentlemen who were only looking out for themselves: on the agricultural front, the yields of experimental plots guided by experts were far behind those of agricultural cooperatives, and even behind ordinary plots; on the industrial front, the miracles of invention were mostly created not by "big intellectuals," but by workers or "small intellectuals" who "had no culture" and "didn't understand science"; on the literary and artistic front, the large number of new folk songs that emerged have already left many professional poets in the dust, both in terms of ideological and artistic value. And so on.

　　“Scholars are made by exams, and skills are proven by trials.” It seems that these "big intellectuals" still have to pass a cultural test. This test is neither easy to "bluff" through, nor possible to "protect" one's way through; it is inevitable that they will be stripped of their armor and dismounted.

　　The bourgeois intellectuals rely on this little capital – their so-called "cultural knowledge" – as something with which they can compete with the proletariat. However, as of today, it can be seen how weak this little capital is.

　　I remember a very realistic saying by George Bernard Shaw. In his talks after his second visit to the Soviet Union, he said: Soviet politicians not only understand socialism, but also understand capitalism; Western bourgeois politicians not only do not understand socialism, but also do not understand capitalism.

　　Now, let me try to apply this formula:

　　The proletarian "small intellectuals" not only understand socialist culture, but also understand capitalist culture; the bourgeois "big intellectuals" not only do not understand socialist culture, but also do not understand capitalist culture.

　　Indeed, these bourgeois "big intellectuals" only know the superficialities of the culture of capitalist society, and not the reasons behind it; while the proletarian intellectuals – the Marxists – are very clear about the ins and outs of the culture of capitalist society.

　　Rightists once had a saying about the "contradiction between big intellectuals and small intellectuals." I think the contradiction lies here. The way to resolve the contradiction, I think, is to admit defeat as early as possible, start learning from scratch, and honestly pass the cultural test.

　　“大知识分子”过文化关
    亚群
    说起来也真有点儿“糟得很”。有些资产阶级的“大知识分子”，满以为文化技术革命的高潮到来，总该他们挂帅，说无产阶级的“小知识分子”一定吃不开，非依靠他们不可。
    然而，事实却偏偏跟这些专门替自己打如意算盘的先生们闹别扭：在农业战线上，专家们指导下的试验田的产量，远远跟不上农业社试验田的产量，甚至跟不上一般的产量；在工业战线上，创造发明奇迹的，大都不是“大知识分子”，而是“没有文化”，“不懂科学”的工人或“小知识分子”；在文艺战线上，大量涌现的新民歌，无论在思想价值艺术价值上，都已使得好些专业诗人们望尘莫及。如此等等。
    “秀才是考出来的，功夫是试出来的”。看来，这些“大知识分子”们还要过一道文化关。这一关，既不容易“瞒混”而过，也不可能“保护”而过，势非丢盔卸甲不可。
    资产阶级的知识分子们，自恃可以跟无产阶级较量较量的就是这一点本钱——所谓“文化知识”。然而，时至今日，已可看出，就是这点本钱又是多么过不得硬啊。
    记得萧伯纳曾经有句很合实际的话，他在他第二次游历苏联回国后发表的谈话中说：苏联的政治家，不仅懂得社会主义，而且也懂得资本主义；西方资产阶级的政治家，不仅不懂得社会主义，而且也不懂得资本主义。
    现在，我试套用一下这个公式：
    无产阶级的“小知识分子”，不仅懂得社会主义的文化，而且也懂得资本主义的文化；资产阶级的“大知识分子”，不仅不懂得社会主义的文化，而且也不懂得资本主义的文化。
    的确，这些资产阶级的“大知识分子”，对于资本主义社会的文化，也是知其然而不知其所以然的；而无产阶级的知识分子——马克思主义者，对于资本主义社会文化的来龙去脉，却是一清二楚的。
    右派分子们曾经有过所谓“大知识分子与小知识分子的矛盾”的说法，我看矛盾就在这里。解决矛盾的办法，我看只有趁早服输，从头学起，老老实实地过好文化关。
