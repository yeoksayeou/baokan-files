　　人民公社化带来的幸福
　　河南推行合作医疗制度
　　本报讯　伴随着人民公社化的实现和生产大跃进，河南省广大农村正开展一个合作医疗运动，目前，全省已有九百六十三个人民公社推行了合作医疗制度，占全省农村公社总数的71.1％。这些人民公社共建立了乡村医院七千六百九十二所，医疗站四千九百九十二个，简易病床二万多张，妇幼院一万六千一百所，产床九万余张，迅速地形成了一个医疗保健网。
　　合作医疗是集中群众的分散资金，依靠群众的力量，通过共产主义协作，解除群众疾病痛苦，保证身体健康的最好方法。实行合作医疗的地区，都是以人民公社或县为单位，协作使用经费，统筹统支。医疗经费的筹集有三种办法：柘城等县是由群众每人每年交二元左右的医疗费，多少由享受合作医疗的群众自行处理；桐柏和邓县等地是由群众每人每年交一元左右的医疗费，不足部分由公社补助；信阳专区部分公社，实行医疗费全部由公社总预算中支出的办法。
　　合作医疗制度的推行，促使农村公社医疗卫生事业多快好省地发展，大大便利群众，更好地为生产服务。桐柏县在实行合作医疗前，群众因经济限制，不能及时治疗疾病而影响生产的每年达五十万个劳动日，自实行合作医疗后，这种现象就没有发生。遂平县卫星人民公社实行合作医疗后，根据生产组织调整了医疗力量。现在公社建立了有二十多张床位的医院，每个大队建立了医疗所，各小队建立了医疗室，医务人员每天到各村、到田间、工地为病人看病，送药上门，形成了一个完整的为生产服务的医疗保健网。
　　合作医疗制度的推行受到了广大群众热烈拥护，他们说：实行合作医疗化，穷人治病不用怕，互助协作保健康，生产跃进劲头大。

　　Happiness Brought by the People's Communes
　　Henan Promotes Cooperative Medical System
　　This newspaper reports: Along with the realization of the people's communes and the Great Leap Forward in production, a cooperative medical movement is being carried out in the vast rural areas of Henan Province. Currently, 963 people's communes in the province have implemented the cooperative medical system, accounting for 71.1% of the total number of rural communes in the province. These people's communes have established a total of 7,692 village hospitals, 4,992 medical stations, more than 20,000 simple hospital beds, 16,100 maternity and child health centers, and more than 90,000 delivery beds, rapidly forming a medical and health care network.
　　Cooperative medical care is the best way to pool the dispersed funds of the masses, rely on the strength of the masses, and relieve the suffering of the masses from diseases and ensure their good health through communist cooperation. In areas where cooperative medical care is implemented, the people's commune or county is the unit for coordinating the use of funds, unified planning and unified expenditure. There are three ways to raise medical funds: in counties such as Zhecheng, the masses pay about two yuan per person per year for medical expenses, and the amount is handled by the masses enjoying cooperative medical care themselves; in Tongbai, Dengxian, and other places, the masses pay about one yuan per person per year for medical expenses, and the commune subsidizes the insufficient part; some communes in the Xinyang area implement a method in which all medical expenses are paid from the commune's total budget.
　　The implementation of the cooperative medical system has promoted the rapid, better, and more economical development of rural commune medical and health undertakings, greatly facilitating the masses and better serving production. Before the implementation of cooperative medical care in Tongbai County, economic constraints prevented the masses from receiving timely treatment for diseases, affecting 500,000 workdays per year. Since the implementation of cooperative medical care, this phenomenon has not occurred. After the Weixing (Satellite) People's Commune in Suiping County implemented cooperative medical care, it adjusted its medical forces according to the production organization. Now the commune has established a hospital with more than 20 beds, each brigade has established a medical station, and each team has established a medical room. Medical staff go to villages, fields, and construction sites every day to see patients and deliver medicines to their homes, forming a complete medical and health care network that serves production.
　　The implementation of the cooperative medical system has been enthusiastically supported by the broad masses, who say: "With the implementation of cooperative medical care, the poor are not afraid of getting sick. Mutual assistance and cooperation ensure good health, and production leaps forward vigorously!"
