Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: Our reporter reports: With the emergence of the great leap forward situation in industrial and agricultural production, especially after the Party Central Committee proposed two measures of running agricultural middle schools and work-study programs, the development of education has galloped forward at an unprecedented scale and speed. According to recent statistics, in just a few months, more than 337,000 new primary schools have been added nationwide, and the number of students enrolled has increased from 64.28 million last year to 83.96 million, equivalent to more than 3.5 times the total number in the highest year before liberation, 1946. A total of 866 counties and cities across the country have basically eliminated illiteracy, and 48.15 million people have shaken off illiteracy, equivalent to 160% of the total number of people who eliminated illiteracy in the past eight years. The number of secondary schools nationwide in 1946, the highest year before liberation, was only 4,266, with 1.49 million students. In the years after liberation, it developed to 11,095 schools with 6.28 million students. In the past few months of this year alone, more than 79,500 new schools have been built, with an increase of 3.6 million students. The number of secondary specialized schools nationwide has also doubled, from 1,320 last year to 2,686; the number of institutions of higher learning has increased from 227 last year to 1,065. In addition, 23,500 spare-time red-and-expert universities and part-work, part-study universities have been established in 27 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. This great leap forward momentum is beyond the reach of all capitalist countries. Taking the growth in the number of students enrolled in institutions of higher learning as an example, the United States only grew by an average of 6.3% per year from 1910 to 1954, and Japan, which was relatively fast, only grew by an average of 12% per year from 1931 to 1953; while China grew by an average of 19.4% per year from 1949 to 1956, and now it is soaring exponentially.

This great victory on the education front was first achieved after the Party further strengthened its leadership over education. Since the spring, Party committees at all levels have convened special education work conferences to summarize past work and make comprehensive plans and arrangements for future work. Under the leadership of the Party, a major debate on education was carried out in various places, criticizing the bourgeois line of so-called "regularization theory" and "a few experts running schools," the bourgeois view of "education for education's sake," as well as various right-leaning conservative ideas and ideas of "superstition" and "inferiority." In order to better exert the leading role of the Party and local initiative, the original vertical-based professional leadership was changed to block-based leadership organizationally, and some education work powers were delegated to local management, such as provinces, special districts, counties, townships, and agricultural cooperatives. Party organizations at all levels broke the "mysterious view" and all had secretaries specially assigned to take charge of education work. In the process of development, various places have achieved a variety of school-running forms under the overall goal of cultivating socialist-minded and cultured laborers, so that education can be improved on the basis of popularization, and popularized under the guidance of improvement, creating a lively situation of a hundred flowers blooming and a garden full of spring.

Under the leadership of the Party, implementing the mass line of mobilizing the whole people to run schools is also one of the important reasons for the rapid development of education in my country in the past six months. Because of following the mass line, things that we didn't dare to think about in the past we dare to think about now, things that we didn't dare to do in the past we dare to do now, and things that we never dreamed of in the past have become a reality now.

The masses not only solved the problems of school buildings and equipment, but also compiled textbooks in many places according to local conditions. Regarding the more difficult issue of teachers, on the one hand, various places have vigorously accelerated training, and on the other hand, the masses have used the method of "the capable being the teacher" to solve the problem locally.

　　百花齐放　万马奔腾
    全国教育事业空前大发展
    据新华社31日讯  本社记者报道：随着工农业生产大跃进形势的出现特别是党中央提出开办农业中学和勤工俭学两个措施后，教育事业的发展更如万马奔腾，一日千里，规模之大和速度之快都是空前的。据最近统计，在短短几个月中，全国新增加的小学计有三十三万七千多所，在校学生数由去年的六千四百二十八万人增加到八千三百九十六万人，相当于解放前最高年份1946年总人数的三点五倍多。全国已有八百六十六个县、市基本扫除了文盲，有四千八百一十五万人摆脱了文盲状态，相当于过去八年扫盲总人数的160％。全国中等学校，解放前最高年份1946年只有四千二百六十六所计一百四十九万人，解放后几年来发展到一万一千零九十五所计六百二十八万人，今年几个月中即新建了七万九千五百多所增加学生三百六十万人。全国中等专业学校，也翻了一番，由去年原有的一千三百二十所增加到二千六百八十六所；高等学校由去年原有的二百二十七所上升到一千零六十五所，另外在二十七个省、自治区、市还办了二万三千五百多所业余红专大学以及半工半读大学等。这种大步跃进的气势，是世界上一切资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。以高等学校在校人数增长为例，美国在1910—1954年平均每年只增长6.3％，比较快的日本1931—1953年间每年也不过平均增长12％；而我国从1949到1956年每年平均增长19.4％，现在更是成倍地飞升。
    教育战线上的这一伟大胜利，首先是党对教育工作进一步加强领导以后取得的。从春季以来，各级党委都专门召开了教育工作会议，总结过去工作，对今后工作作了全面规划和安排。各地在党的领导下对教育工作进行了一场大辩论，批判了所谓“正规论”、“少数专家办学”的资产阶级路线，“为教育而教育”的资产阶级观点以及各式各样的右倾保守思想和“迷信”、“自卑”思想。为了更好地发挥党的领导作用和地方积极性，从组织上把原来条条为主的业务领导改为块块为主的领导，把一部分教育工作权力下放到地方管理，省、专区、县、乡、农业社等。各级党的组织打破了“神秘观点”，都有书记专门分工掌握教育工作。在发展中各地做到了在培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者这一总目标下，办学形式多种多样，使教育既能在普及的基础上提高，又在提高的指导下普及，出现了百花齐放、满园春色的生动活泼的局面。
    在党的领导下，实行全民动手办学的群众路线，也是近半年来我国教育事业迅速发展的重要原因之一。由于走群众路线，过去不敢想的事现在敢想了，过去不敢干的事现在敢干了，过去梦想不到的事现在成为现实了。
    群众不但解决了校舍、设备等问题，并且在许多地方还根据当地实际情况编写了教材。比较困难的师资问题，各地一方面大力加速地培养，一方面群众又用“能者为师”的办法自己就地解决。
