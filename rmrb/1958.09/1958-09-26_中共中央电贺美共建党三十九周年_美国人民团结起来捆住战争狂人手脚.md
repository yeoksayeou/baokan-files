Xinhua News Agency, September 25th—The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to the National Committee of the Communist Party USA, congratulating the Communist Party USA on its 39th anniversary. The Communist Party USA is scheduled to hold a commemorative meeting in New York on September 26 to celebrate the party's 39th birthday. The full text of the CPC Central Committee's congratulatory telegram is as follows:
Comrades of the National Committee of the Communist Party USA:
	On the occasion of the 39th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party USA, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends to you, and through you to the entire membership of the Communist Party USA and the American working people, fraternal and warm congratulations.
	For thirty-nine years, the Communist Party USA has loyally carried out unremitting struggles for the interests of the American working class and the American working people, demonstrating that the Communist Party USA is the most loyal defender of the interests of the American working class and working people.
	In recent years, the Communist Party USA has struggled under extremely difficult conditions, smashed the suppression and sabotage schemes of class enemies, eliminated the revisionists headed by Gates, and defended the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, thereby achieving encouraging progress in restoring and improving the party's fighting capacity, consolidating and strengthening the party's unity, and improving and strengthening the party's ties with the masses.
	Today, just as the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, together with all peace-loving countries and people, are continuing to make significant efforts to consolidate world peace, the American imperialist war clique is stubbornly continuing to oppose the people of the world and the American people, and is continuing to pursue its policies of aggression and war. Not long ago, the United States carried out armed intervention against the Arab countries in the Near East. Recently, the United States has even intensified its armed provocations and war threats against the People's Republic of China. Faced with this situation, the Communist Party USA is further striving to unite all peace-loving people in the United States to carry out an arduous struggle against the American imperialist policies of aggression and war. We are deeply convinced that through your struggles, the American people will increasingly realize that the reactionary policies of the American war clique can only bring extremely profound disasters to the American people and will not bring any benefits. As long as the American people understand this and unite to actively oppose and stop the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism, then the hands and feet of the American warmongers, who are igniting fires everywhere in the world and disrupting the peaceful lives of the people of all countries, will be tied up, and world peace will be further guaranteed.
	We wish your party, under the leadership of the National Committee headed by Comrades Foster and Dennis, new achievements in crushing the dangers of revisionism, consolidating and strengthening the party ranks, strengthening the unity of the American working class, defending the democratic freedoms of the American people, and safeguarding world peace.
										The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    中共中央电贺美共建党三十九周年
    美国人民团结起来捆住战争狂人手脚
    新华社25日讯  中国共产党中央委员会致电美国共产党全国委员会，祝贺美国共产党建党三十九周年。美国共产党定于9月26日在纽约举行纪念大会，庆祝党的三十九周年生日。中共中央的贺电全文如下：美国共产党全国委员会
  的同志们：
    欣逢美国共产党成立三十九周年的纪念日，中国共产党中央委员会谨向你们，并通过你们向美国共产党全体党员和美国劳动人民致以兄弟般的热诚的祝贺。
    三十九年来，美国共产党忠诚地为美国工人阶级和美国劳动人民的利益进行着坚持不懈的斗争，表明了美国共产党是美国工人阶级和劳动人民的利益的最忠实的捍卫者。
    近年来，美国共产党在极为困难的条件下进行奋斗，粉碎了阶级敌人的镇压破坏阴谋，清除了以盖茨为首的修正主义分子，捍卫了马克思列宁主义的基本原则，从而在恢复和提高党的战斗力、巩固和增强党的团结、改善和加强党同人民群众的联系等方面获得了令人鼓舞的进展。
    今天，正当苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家同一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起为着巩固世界和平而顽强不懈地继续作重大努力的时候，美国帝国主义战争集团却顽固地继续同世界人民和美国人民为敌，继续推行它的侵略政策和战争政策。不久以前，美国对中近东阿拉伯国家实行了武装干涉。最近，美国并且变本加厉地对中华人民共和国进行武装挑衅和战争威胁。面对着这一形势，美国共产党正在进一步努力团结美国一切爱好和平的人们，进行反对美国帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的艰巨斗争。我们深信，通过你们的斗争，美国人民将日益了解到美国战争集团的反动政策，只能使美国人民蒙受极其深重的灾难，而不会得到任何好处。只要美国人民都了解了这一点，从而团结起来，积极地反对和制止美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，那么，美国的战争狂人在世界到处点火、破坏各国人民和平生活的手脚，就会被捆住，世界和平就会得到进一步的保障。
    祝你们的党在以福斯特和丹尼斯同志为首的全国委员会的领导之下，在粉碎修正主义的危害、巩固和壮大党的队伍、加强美国工人阶级的团结、维护美国人民的民主自由和保卫世界和平的斗争中取得新的成就。  				中国共产党中央委员会
