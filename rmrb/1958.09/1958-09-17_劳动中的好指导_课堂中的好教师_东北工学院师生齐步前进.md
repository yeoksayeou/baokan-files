    Reported by our correspondent Cao Zhixian: Teachers at Northeast Institute of Technology, while leading students in work-study production activities, are beginning to step out of the classroom and delve into practical production, enriching teaching content.

    Since the launch of the work-study program at Northeast Institute of Technology in March, teachers have been actively seeking opportunities for work-study. Young teachers from the four departments—Mining, Nonferrous Metals, Mechanical Engineering, and Iron and Steel Metallurgy—have taken the lead, directly supervising work-study students in various production tasks, including geological surveys, mine surveying, farmland surveying, mine transportation, steel rolling, and sand casting, across twenty-two cities and counties in Liaoning Province. They also joined students in various manual labor tasks such as moving earth, bricklaying, installing and repairing machinery, and operating machine tools. Jiang Jingming, a teacher from the Light Metal Smelting Teaching and Research Group of the Nonferrous Metals Department, even worked alongside students in the school's iron-making factory, like a seasoned technician, assisting them in mastering the technical operation methods for producing beryllium oxide and beryllium bronze.

    Through work-study production activities, teachers at Northeast Institute of Technology have come into contact with practical production, closely integrating teaching, scientific research, and production. Teachers in the Nonferrous Metals Department have developed a new atmosphere of everyone going to the factory and everyone going to the site. Many teachers change into work clothes immediately after class, squatting in the factory or laboratory to conduct experiments or practical operations with students. The eleven teachers in the Light Metal Smelting Teaching and Research Office, while working with students to produce aluminum using indigenous methods, created a new indigenous method for aluminum smelting that is not found internationally and a simple method for smelting aluminum-tin alloys in blast furnaces. Based on their practical experience, they decided to incorporate indigenous aluminum smelting and blast furnace aluminum-tin alloy smelting as new chapters in the teaching materials, to be taught in the new academic year.

    At the same time, many teachers have also applied the latest technologies from books to production through work-study production practice. For example, when teachers from the Mineral Processing Teaching and Research Office worked at the Qingchengzi Lead Mine, they applied the "heavy medium" mineral processing technology, which has not yet been used in China, to mineral processing production for the first time, increasing the mine's production efficiency by one time.

    Because teachers have widely contacted practical production in the work-study activities, they and their students completed 534 research projects serving production in a short period of time. At the same time, on the basis of establishing contacts and cooperation with more than 200 factories and mines, they jointly guided students to produce 90 kinds of products and completed 109 design projects for 87 factories and mines.

### 劳动中的好指导　课堂中的好教师  东北工学院师生齐步前进

    劳动中的好指导　课堂中的好教师
    东北工学院师生齐步前进
    本报讯　记者曹志贤报道：东北工业学院教师在领导学生进行勤工俭学的生产活动中，开始走出教室，深入生产实际。充实教学内容。
    东北工学院的勤工俭学活动从3月开始以来，教师们四出奔走，寻找勤工俭学的门路。采矿、有色金属、机械、钢铁冶炼等四个系的青年教师一马当先，直接领导勤工俭学的学生，分别到辽宁省二十二个市县进行了地质普查、矿山测量、农田测量、矿井运输、轧钢、翻砂等多种生产工作。他们还和学生一起，参加抬土、砌砖、安装和修理机器、开动机床等多种体力劳动。有色金属系轻金属冶炼教研组的教师蒋经明还在校内的制铁工厂里跟班生产，像老技工一样，帮助学生掌握生产氧化铍和铍青铜的技术操作方法。
    通过勤工俭学的生产活动，东北工学院的教师接触到了生产实际，使教学、科学研究和生产实际紧密结合。有色金属系的教师通过勤工俭学，形成了人人下工厂、个个去现场的新风气，许多教师一下课就换上工作服，蹲在工厂里或实验室里和学生们一起做实验或进行实际操作。轻金属冶炼教研室的十一名教师在和学生一起搞土法炼铝的生产过程中，创出了国际上没有的一种土法炼铝的新方法和高炉炼铝锡合金的简易方法等。他们根据实践所得，决定把土法炼铝和高炉炼铝锡合金等列为新的章节，充实到教材中去，在新学年中讲授。
    在这同时，许多教师还通过勤工俭学的生产实践，把书本上的最新技术应用到生产中去，像选矿教研室的教师在青城子铅矿工作时，把国内还没有应用的“重介质”选矿新技术第一次应用到选矿生产上，使这个矿的生产效率提高一倍。
    由于教师们在勤工俭学的活动中广泛接触了生产实际，他们和学生一起在短期内完成了五百三十四个为生产服务的研究项目，同时在同二百多个厂矿建立联系和协作的基础上，共同指导学生制出了九十种产品，并给八十七个厂矿完成了一百零九项设计工作。
