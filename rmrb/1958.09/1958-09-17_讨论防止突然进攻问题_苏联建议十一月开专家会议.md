Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 16th. TASS Moscow, September 16th: The Soviet government, in its reply to the U.S. government regarding the issue of preventing sudden attacks, suggested that a meeting of experts to discuss this matter be held in Geneva on November 10th. The Soviet government also hopes that the work of this meeting can be concluded in the shortest possible time, such as four or five weeks.

The Soviet government's reply was delivered by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov to U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to the Soviet Union, Davis, on the 15th.

The Soviet government also suggested that representatives from the United States, Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania participate in this expert meeting.

The Soviet note once again emphasized that it is entirely possible to reach an agreement on measures to prevent sudden attacks, provided that the interests of both sides are considered fairly and no actions are taken that would sharpen the international situation and increase the risk of war.

    讨论防止突然进攻问题
    苏联建议十一月开专家会议
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：苏联政府就防止突然进攻问题复照美国政府，建议讨论这个问题的专家会议在11月10日在日内瓦举行。苏联政府并希望这个会议的工作能够在最短时期内——如四、五周内结束。
    苏联政府的复照是由苏联外交部副部长库兹涅佐夫在15日交给美国驻苏联临时代办戴维斯的。
    苏联政府还建议，这次专家会议由美国、英国、法国、比利时、苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚等国的代表参加。
    苏联照会再次强调指出，只要公正地考虑双方利益，并不再采取导致国际局势尖锐化和增加战争危险的行动，就防止突然进攻措施取得协议是完全可能的。
