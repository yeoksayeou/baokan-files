By Laying Out the Situation, Presenting the Facts, and Meticulously Accounting
Bengbu Prefectural Committee Criticizes Conservative Thought

(Our newspaper, Hefei, 26th dispatch) The Bengbu Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened an expanded conference of finance and trade cadres, focusing on criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking of some commercial cadres who lacked sufficient understanding of the situation of the autumn agricultural bumper harvest. This laid a good foundation for implementing the policy of large-scale purchasing and selling and doing a good job in the peak season commercial work.

This year, the total grain output of the Bengbu Special Zone will increase by more than one and a half times compared to last year, and the output of major cash crops such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and flax, as well as other agricultural and sideline products, will also increase several times compared to last year. Due to the bumper harvest in agriculture, farmers are asking the state to purchase agricultural and sideline products more quickly and in larger quantities, and the state must meet the farmers' requirements to sell agricultural products to support the development of agricultural production. According to the conference's examination, many people still lacked a full estimate of this situation, and the preparations for purchasing work could not meet the objective needs. Fengyang had a bumper harvest of tobacco leaves this year, with a total output more than four times that of last year. However, the county's commercial departments did not make sufficient preparations for the purchasing work. They believed that adding 2,000 more tobacco kilns to the existing 4,000 kilns would solve the problem. However, the result of meticulously accounting at this conference showed that, in addition to fully utilizing the potential of the 6,000 tobacco kilns, nearly half of the tobacco leaves still lacked flue-curing equipment. In July and August, the commercial departments of Chu County did a poor job in the purchase of live pigs. The masses criticized them for "three no-goes": they did not go to scattered villages, remote areas, or pigsties, and the purchase task was completed poorly. However, the county's commercial departments believed that pigs could not be purchased because there were few fat pigs in the countryside. Later, the Chu County Party Committee strengthened its leadership, and the purchasing work deepened. In just a few days, more than 2,000 pigs were purchased in seven townships alone.

With the agricultural harvest, rural purchasing power will increase, and the demand for means of production and consumer goods supplied by the state will greatly increase compared to previous years, especially since the entire special zone will realize a network of rivers next spring, and the demand for water conservancy equipment will be even greater after the autumn. Some people are not clear about this situation either and want to "discharge" all the means of production they have purchased. In terms of consumer goods, some commercial cadres see that the inventory is a bit more than last year and are afraid that purchasing too many goods will cause stockpiling, so they are unwilling to purchase more goods, or only purchase goods that sold well in the past.

The conference used the method of laying out the situation, presenting the facts, and meticulously accounting to criticize the above-mentioned right-leaning conservative thinking. The cadres attending the meeting clarified the new situation of agricultural production and the new requirements put forward by this new situation for commercial work, and expressed that they would resolutely implement the policy of large-scale purchasing and selling. In terms of agricultural product procurement, in addition to resolutely completing the assigned procurement tasks of tobacco leaves, cotton, and flax, they will also strive to expand the procurement volume by 30% to 40%. In terms of commodity supply, they must cooperate with all parties to actively organize sources of goods, and pay special attention to purchasing local industrial products to meet the needs of the rural peak season market.

### 摆形势摆事实算细账  蚌埠地委批判保守思想

    摆形势摆事实算细账
    蚌埠地委批判保守思想
    本报合肥26日电  中共蚌埠地委最近召开财贸干部扩大会议，着重批判了某些商业干部对秋季农业大丰收形势认识不足的右倾保守思想，为贯彻大购大销方针，做好旺季商业工作，打下了良好的基础。
    今年蚌埠专区的粮食总产量将比去年增加一倍半以上，棉花、烤烟、麻类等主要农作物以及其他农副产品的产量，也将比去年翻几番。由于农业大丰收，农民要求国家又多又快地收购农副产品，国家也必须满足农民出售农产品的这种要求，支持农业生产的发展。根据会议的检查，不少人对这种形势还缺乏充分的估计，收购的准备工作不能适应客观需要。凤阳今年烟叶大丰收，总产量比去年翻两番以上，但是县商业部门对收购工作没有进行充分准备，他们认为在去年四千只烟炕的基础上再增加两千只烟炕，就可以解决问题了。但是，这次会议算细账的结果，除了充分发挥六千只烟炕的潜力以外，还有将近一半的烟叶缺乏烤烟设备。7、8月份，滁县商业部门的生猪收购工作做得不好，群众批评他们是三不去：分散村庄、偏远地区和猪圈都不去，收购任务完成得很差。而县商业部门却认为猪收购不上来，是因为农村肥猪少，后来，中共滁县县委加强了领导，收购工作深入一步，几天内仅在七个乡镇就收购到两千多头。
    随着农业丰收，农村购买力将增多，要求国家供应的生产资料和生活资料将比往年大大增加，特别是全专区明春要实现河网化，秋后对水利器材的需要量更大。这种局势也有些人看不清楚，想把购进来的生产资料都“泻”掉。在生活资料方面，有些商业干部看到库存比去年多了一些，怕多进货造成积压，就不愿再进货了，或者只进过去好销的货。
    会议用摆形势、摆事实和算细账的办法批判了上述右倾保守思想。到会干部弄清了农业生产的新形势，和这种新形势对商业工作提出的新要求，表示要坚决贯彻执行大购大销方针。在农产品采购方面，除了坚决地完成上级分配的烟叶、棉花、麻类的收购任务以外，还争取扩大采购量30％到40％。在商品供应方面，要和各方面协作积极地组织货源，特别要注意采购地方工业产品，以满足农村旺季市场的需要。
