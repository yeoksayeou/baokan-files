Xinjiang expands Winter Wheat Acreage

(By our correspondent) Farmers of all ethnic groups and state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are expanding cultivated land and increasing per-unit yield simultaneously, and are stepping up the expansion of winter wheat planting. This autumn, the planting of winter wheat will increase by 37% compared with last year, reaching eight million mu, and a series of advanced agricultural measures to increase per-unit yield, such as deep plowing, close planting, and application of more base fertilizer, are being universally adopted to lay a solid foundation for the average wheat yield to surpass the Yellow River.

In order to expand the cultivated area, state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms, mainly composed of agricultural production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region, have reclaimed more than 2.5 million mu of wasteland from spring to now. The wasteland on the edges of fields reclaimed by farmers of all ethnic groups in conjunction with land leveling accounts for more than 30% of the area of leveled land; and farmers in Hotan, Kashgar, Changji and other regions have also organized agricultural cooperative land reclamation expeditions to reclaim "flying fields."

In order to fundamentally change the extensive wheat cultivation state, all parts of the autonomous region have held wheat on-the-spot meetings since the wheat harvest, combined with this year's national wheat "satellite fields" and the high-yield examples in various parts of the autonomous region, criticized the "backwardness theory" and "inferiority complex" in ethnic minority areas. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions based on this situation, requiring that the eight million mu of winter wheat to be sown this year be universally deep-plowed to a depth of one foot to one and a half feet, except for land with shallow soil layers, and that an average of 10,000 to 15,000 jin of base fertilizer be applied per mu. All wheat seeds should be improved varieties, treated with pesticides, and densely planted, requiring a seedling survival rate of more than 400,000 plants per mu, and do a good job of watering and overwintering after winter wheat emergence.

    新疆扩大冬麦面积
    本报讯  新疆维吾尔自治区各族农民和国营农牧场扩大耕地与提高单产同时并举，正在加紧扩大冬麦播种工作。今年秋种冬麦将比去年增加37％，达到八百万亩，并且普遍采用深耕、密植、多施基肥等一系列提高单产的先进的农业措施，为小麦平均单产过黄河打下坚固的基础。
    为了扩大耕地面积，以新疆军区农业生产部队为主体的国营农牧场，从春天到现在已开垦出了二百五十多万亩荒地。各民族农民结合平整土地开垦的田边地角的荒地，占平整土地面积的30％以上；和阗、喀什、昌吉等地区的农民，还组织了农业社远征垦荒队，开垦飞田。
    为了从根本上改变小麦耕作粗放状态，自治区各地从麦收以来，纷纷召开了小麦现场会议，结合今年全国小麦“卫星田”和自治区各地的丰产事例，批判了民族地区“落后论”和“自卑感”。中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会根据这种情况发出指示，要求今年播种的八百万亩冬麦，除土层浅地外，普遍深翻一尺到一尺五寸，平均每亩施基肥一万到一万五千斤，小麦籽种全部良种化、振药和密植，要求每亩保苗在四十万株以上，并认真做好冬麦出苗后的浇水和越冬工作。
