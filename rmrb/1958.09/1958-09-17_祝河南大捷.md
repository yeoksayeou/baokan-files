As expected, good news keeps coming from the steel front! Yesterday, this newspaper reported that Guizhou Province had completed its September pig iron production plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. Today, we received the exciting news that Hunan Province is producing 3,000 tons of pig iron per day. What is particularly exciting is the great victory from Henan: Henan Province, which once ranked among the top in wheat production, is now leading the way in indigenous blast furnace iron smelting. On September 15th, the province's indigenous blast furnaces produced 18,693.92 tons of pig iron in one day. Among them, the daily output of eight counties including Yu County, Lushan, Baofeng, Linru, Xinyang, Dengfeng, Shangcheng, and Bo'ai all exceeded 1,000 tons. Yu County took the lead with a record high daily output of 4,396 tons of pig iron. Such a high-yield record is truly an amazing miracle!

A few days ago, we published the following information: Henan Province planned to produce 135,000 tons of pig iron in September, and produced a total of 7,857 tons from the 1st to the 10th. This means that in the first ten days of September, the daily pig iron production in Henan Province was only more than 780 tons. Only four days have passed, and on September 15th, the province's pig iron production reached more than 18,000 tons. From 780 to 18,000, the pig iron production increased more than twenty times, which fully demonstrates that under the inspiration of the general line of socialist construction, the wisdom and strength of the people are beyond the calculation of any genius mathematician. "It is people who make things happen," and "Man can conquer nature." These are clichés, but they are universal truths. By giving full play to people's wisdom and strength, miracles can be created.

From Henan's great victory in iron smelting, an important lesson can be learned: it is the key to overcoming all difficulties for leaders to go to the front line, mingle with the masses, share weal and woe, work together, and fully mobilize the strength of the masses. Look at Yu County, which produces more than 4,000 tons of iron per day: there, five county party secretaries and seventeen county party committee members went to four steel combat zones, leading 150,000 steel soldiers to work hard day and night; 80% of the cadres of the county's directly affiliated organs went to the mountains overnight, each taking charge of a furnace. This practice of leading cadres going to the front line and mingling with the masses, on the one hand, encouraged the masses with the leaders' determination and exemplary actions, and strengthened their fighting spirit; on the other hand, it enabled the leaders to gain true knowledge from the joint practical operation with the masses, and to summarize the experience of the masses in a timely manner, master skills, and guide the general. Leaders mingling with the masses, living together, and fighting together is the fine tradition of our party in carrying out revolutionary struggles for decades. The example of Henan once again proves that maintaining this fine tradition can overcome difficulties and achieve victory.

When it comes to leaders mingling with the masses, leaving the office, going to the front line, and "eating by the furnace, sleeping by the furnace," some people don't think much of it, saying that this is a bit of a "rural style" and "guerrilla habit." In fact, it is not only "a bit," it is simply "rural style" and "guerrilla habit." However, we want to ask: what's wrong with such a "rural style" and "guerrilla habit"? Our party has been infected with such a "rural style" and "guerrilla habit" for decades, which can be said to be a long time and a deep time. Not only have we never felt that there is anything wrong, but it is very good. Isn't it precisely this "rural style" and "guerrilla habit" that have enabled our party to unite closely with the broad masses of the people, defeat the domestic and foreign reactionaries, overcome numerous difficulties, and win the victory of the revolutionary war? Today, although we are no longer fighting guerrillas, the task before us is arduous construction. The so-called "rural style" and "guerrilla habit" of mingling with the masses, as the glorious tradition of our party and as a genuine Marxist-Leninist style, should be carried forward in industrial construction.

Henan's great victory in iron smelting also fully demonstrated the power of indigenous blast furnaces and small blast furnaces. How powerful are indigenous blast furnaces and small blast furnaces? Before today, many people did not have enough understanding of this. Not to mention that the "head-shaking faction in front of the furnace" once doubted it, even many comrades in the promotion faction could not figure it out. The miracle of Henan shows that the power of indigenous blast furnaces and small blast furnaces is much greater than people can imagine. Because they are indigenous and small, we can boldly mobilize the masses to run them. A county can build thousands of them in a few days, and together they can produce thousands of tons of iron a day. Any contempt for indigenous blast furnaces and small blast furnaces, such as the "low-yield theory," the "short-life theory," and the "impossibility of large-scale high yield," have all gone bankrupt in the face of the facts of Henan's great victory in iron smelting.

Henan Province's daily production of more than 18,000 tons of iron is a great encouragement to the people of the whole country. We now have more reason to firmly believe that the pig iron barrier will definitely be broken through. Now the steel boom is boiling all over the country. We congratulate the people of Henan on their great victory in iron smelting, and hope that they will consolidate their existing achievements and continue to move forward; at the same time, we also believe that all provinces and autonomous regions in the country will be able to be like Henan Province, go all out, strive for the top, grasp tightly and ruthlessly, and strive to fundamentally reverse the abnormal situation of indigenous blast furnace pig iron production in September, and complete and over fulfill the iron production plan for September.

### 祝河南大捷

    祝河南大捷
    果然不出所料，钢铁战线上接连传来了好消息！昨天本报才报道了贵州省提前超额完成9月份生铁生产计划，今天又得到了湖南日产生铁三千吨的消息，特别令人兴奋的是从河南传来的大捷报：曾经在小麦产量上名列前茅的河南省，现在又在土高炉炼铁方面遥遥领先。在9月15日这一天里，河南全省的土高炉日产生铁一万八千六百九十三点九二吨。其中禹县、鲁山、宝丰、临汝、信阳、登封、商城、博爱等八个县的日产量都在千吨以上。禹县又以日产四千三百九十六吨生铁的最高纪录，走在最前面。这样的丰产纪录，真是惊人的奇迹！
    几天以前，我们公布过这样的材料：河南省9月份计划生产生铁十三万五千吨，1日至10日共生产了七千八百五十七吨。这就是说，9月上旬河南全省每天的生铁产量只有七百八十多吨。时间只过去了四天，9月15日，全省生铁的产量就达到一万八千多吨。从七百八，到一万八，生铁产量猛增二十几倍，充分说明了在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，人民群众的智慧和力量是任何天才的数学家也无法计算的。“事在人为”，“人定胜天”，这虽是老生常谈，但却是普遍真理。把人的智慧和力量充分发挥出来，就可以创造奇迹。
    从河南炼铁大捷中，可以学到一条重要的经验：领导亲自上前线，同群众打成一片，同甘苦，共劳动，把群众的力量充分发动起来，是战胜一切困难的关键。请看日产四千多吨铁的禹县吧：那里五位县委书记和十七位县委委员，分赴四个钢铁作战区，率领十五万钢铁大军日夜苦战；那里县直属机关80％的干部连夜上山，一人包一个炉子。这种领导干部亲自上前线，同群众打成一片的做法，一方面使群众从领导的决心和以身作则的模范行动中得到鼓舞，坚定了斗志；一方面使领导从和群众共同实际操作中得到真知，能够及时总结群众的经验，掌握技能，指导一般。领导同群众打成一片，生活在一起，战斗在一起，这是我们党数十年来进行革命斗争的优良传统。河南的例子又一次证明了保持这个优良传统就能战胜困难取得胜利。
    谈到领导同群众打成一片，走出办公室，亲自上前线，以及“吃在炉边，睡在炉边”等等，有些人总不大以为然，说这有点“农村作风”、“游击习气”。其实，何止是“有点”，简直就是“农村作风”、“游击习气”。可是，我们要问：这样的“农村作风”、“游击习气”又有什么不好呢？我们党沾染这样的“农村作风”、“游击习气”数十年于兹，可谓久矣，也可为深矣，不但从没有感觉到有什么不好，而且好得很。难道不正是这种“农村作风”、“游击习气”，使我们的党同广大人民群众紧紧团结在一起，战胜了国内外的反动派，克服了重重困难，取得了革命战争的胜利吗？今天，虽然不打游击了，但是，摆在我们面前的任务是艰巨的建设，同群众打成一片的所谓“农村作风”、“游击习气”，作为我们党的光荣传统，作为地地道道的马克思列宁主义作风，正应该在工业建设工作上发扬光大。
    河南炼铁大捷，也充分显示了土高炉和小高炉的威力。土高炉和小高炉的威力究竟有多大？在今天以前，许多人是认识不足的。不要说是“炉前摇头派”曾经怀疑过，就是促进派的行列中也有许多同志摸不到底。河南的奇迹说明了土高炉和小高炉的威力远比人们所能想像到的大得多。因为土、因为小，我们就可以放手发动群众来办，一个县就可以在几天之内建上几千个，加起来一天就能出几千吨铁。任何看不起土高炉和小高炉，什么“低产论”、“短寿论”、“大面积丰产不可能论”，都在河南炼铁大捷的事实面前破产了。
    河南省日产一万八千多吨铁，对全国人民是一个极大的鼓舞。我们现在已经有更加充分的理由可以坚信，生铁这一关是一定能够突破的。现在全国各地的钢铁热潮正在沸腾着。我们祝贺河南人民的炼铁大捷，希望他们巩固已有的成绩，继续前进；同时也相信全国各个省和自治区一定能够都像河南省一样，鼓足干劲，力争上游，紧紧地抓，狠狠地抓，争取9月份内根本扭转土高炉生铁生产不正常的局面，完成和超额完成9月份的产铁计划。
