    Plant Flags and Set Up Markers
    to Select Good Seeds
    (Our newspaper dispatch) In Chaihudian Township, Ningjin County, Hebei Province, millet and corn are generally growing well this year, with tall stalks, large ears, and full grains. In order to do a good job in selecting fine seeds, the township has organized a 1,500-person seed selection team to divide up the work by assigning specific areas and plots to be responsible for seed selection. After on-site inspection, 312 plots of "August 1st Millet" and 175 plots of "Tangshan White Corn" were designated as superior seed land. Each seed selection team has planted flags and set up markers on the designated superior seed land, and assigned specific personnel for management. During harvest, they will be specially harvested, specially threshed, and stored by dedicated personnel.
