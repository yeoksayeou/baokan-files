Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The military adventure policy carried out by the American ruling group in the Taiwan region has aroused dissatisfaction among the American public. Although most pro-government newspapers have vigorously promoted and supported American armed intervention in China's internal affairs, some newspapers have had to publish readers' letters opposing Dulles' "brink of war" policy. These letters raise the question: What right does the United States have to decide the fate of China's islands?

A reader's letter published in the "Daily Mirror" said: "Don't we have enough unpleasant things besides going to participate in China's new war? Isn't the lesson of Korea enough for us?"

A reader of the "New York Post" wrote: "How many American lives are we going to sacrifice to support a traitorous regime driven out of mainland China?"

The "Baltimore Sun" published a letter from Thomas. He wrote that the policy pursued by Dulles does not conform to the interests of the American people and is not supported by the American people. Thomas wrote that Dulles "threatens to drag us into war for Jinmen Island and send our sons to die for Chiang Kai-shek." Thomas wrote, "Our Far Eastern policy of not recognizing reality is very bad, and if it causes a second Korean incident, or worse, a world war, then this policy will end in a tragic bankruptcy." He finally said that the American people not only have the right but also should express their opinions.

The "New York Herald Tribune" published a letter from reader Nathanson. Nathanson wrote, "We cannot risk playing with the fate of the whole world and treating wishes as reality." "Communist China will not disappear just because we want it to."

"New York Post" commentators Lerner and Shannon criticized Dulles' Far Eastern policy. Lerner wrote that Dulles' entire policy toward the People's Republic of China is a "policy of brinkmanship, that is, to engage in nerve warfare, which is only a stone's throw away from hot war, so that we have a serious danger of falling into the abyss." Shannon said, "Our policy toward China has been a complete failure and there is no way out."

Some local newspapers have also expressed dissatisfaction with Dulles' Far Eastern policy. An editorial in the Detroit "Free Press" wrote, "We seriously doubt whether one in a million Americans is willing to fight for Taiwan." The newspaper believes that the US government must "face reality" and "should not deceive itself with the illusion that China will disappear as long as the United States ignores it." The newspaper said, "It would be a terrible thing to enter a world war just to protect Chiang Kai-shek, who lives on our dollars in Taiwan."

Commentator Pearson pointed out in an article published in the "Washington Post and Times Herald" that the Eisenhower administration's adventurous policy toward China is not only to use Taiwan, which the United States occupies, as a springboard for military provocations against the People's Republic of China, but also is directly related to the selfish interests of many Republicans. Pearson pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's cronies paid huge sums as campaign funds for American congressmen and bribed American journalists to "instill the idea into the American people that if Taiwan is given enough dollars, Chiang Kai-shek may return to China."

Not only newspaper editorial departments, but also politicians and congressmen are constantly receiving such letters from the public.

Former US Secretary of State and Democrat Acheson issued a statement to the press on the 6th, accusing the US government's Far Eastern policy.

Acheson said, "It seems that we are giddily or carelessly allowing ourselves to be drawn into a war with China. In this war, we have neither friends nor allies, for a problem that the government has not explained to the people and is not worth sacrificing an American life for."

Acheson believes that the US decision to use American troops to help Chiang Kai-shek "defend" China's coastal islands is "terrible." He said that the US government has "unwisely" fallen into a "hopeless situation" and "lost control of the situation." He said that the US "government's attitude is this: it does not try to extricate us from this situation in calm times, and it has no way to deal with it in times of crisis." He advocated immediately withdrawing Chiang's army from China's coastal islands to Taiwan.

Acheson also suggested that the US government consult more with other countries' "cool-headed friends" on the Far East issue.

Major General Hurley, former US Secretary of the Army and Ambassador to China, also said on the 5th that it would be suicidal for the United States to use troops against mainland China when the Soviet Union supports China, which has a population of 600 million.

### 美国公众不满政府挑衅政策  纷纷写信给报纸反对杜勒斯的声明  艾奇逊指责政府晕头转向

　　美国公众不满政府挑衅政策
　　纷纷写信给报纸反对杜勒斯的声明
　　艾奇逊指责政府晕头转向
    他们问：美国有什么权利决定中国岛屿命运？难道朝鲜的教训对美国还不够吗？华盛顿打算牺牲多少美国人的性命？
    本报综合报道，据新华社讯：美国统治集团在台湾地区所执行的军事冒险政策，引起了美国公众的不满。虽然大部分亲政府的报刊大肆宣传，支持美国武装干涉中国内政，但是某些报纸也不得不刊载了反对杜勒斯的“战争边缘”政策的读者来信。这些来信提出这样的问题：美国有什么权利去决定中国岛屿的命运？
    “每日镜报”刊载的一封读者来信说：“难道除了去参加中国的新战争以外，我们的不愉快事情还少吗？难道朝鲜的教训对我们还不够吗？”
    “纽约邮报”的读者写道：“为了支持从中国大陆赶出来的卖国政权，我们打算牺牲多少美国人的性命呢？”
    “巴尔的摩太阳报”登载了托马斯的来信。他写道，杜勒斯所执行的政策，不符合美国人民的利益，同时得不到美国人民的支持。托马斯写道，杜勒斯“扬言要为了金门岛把我们卷入战争，要为了蒋介石把我们的儿子派去送死”。托马斯写道，“我们的不承认现实的远东政策是很糟糕的，如果它引起第二次朝鲜事件，或者更坏一些，引起世界大战，那么这种政策将以悲惨的破产而告终”。他最后说，美国人民不仅有权而且应该表示自己的意见。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”发表了读者纳坦森的来信。纳坦森写道，“我们不能冒险玩弄全世界的命运，把愿望当成现实”。“共产党中国不会因为我们希望它消失而就会不存在了”。
    “纽约邮报”评论员勒纳和谢农对杜勒斯的远东政策进行了抨击。勒纳写道，杜勒斯对中华人民共和国的整个政策，就是“濒于战争边缘的政策，也就是要进行神经战，这种神经战离开热战只有咫尺之差，以至于我们有坠入深渊的严重危险”。谢农说，“我们对中国的政策遭到了完全的失败，并且毫无出路”。
    某些地方报纸也对杜勒斯的远东政策表示不满。底特律城“自由日报”的社论写道，“我们十分怀疑，一百万美国人中是否有一个人愿意去为台湾作战”。报纸认为，美国政府必须“正视现实”，“不应该自己骗自己，幻想只要美国无视中国，中国就会消失”。报纸说，“如果只是为了保护依靠我们的美元生活在台湾的蒋介石而进入世界大战，这简直是件可怕的事”。
    评论员皮尔逊在“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”发表的文章中指出，艾森豪威尔政府对待中国的冒险政策不仅是想把美国所占领的台湾作为对中华人民共和国进行军事挑衅的跳板，而且是同许多共和党人的自私利益直接相关的。皮尔逊指出，蒋介石的亲信付出了巨款作为美国国会议员竞选运动的基金，并且收买了美国记者，要他们“把这种思想灌输给美国人民：如果给台湾足够数量的美元，蒋介石就可能重回中国”。
    不仅是报纸编辑部，就是政界人士和议员也源源不断地收到公众这样的来信。
    美国前国务卿、民主党人艾奇逊6日向报界发表声明，指责美国政府的远东政策。
    艾奇逊说，“看来我们正在晕头转向地或者满不在乎地听任自己卷入和中国的战争中去。在这场战争中，我们既没有朋友，又没有盟国，为的是政府没有向人民说明的而且不值得牺牲一个美国人的生命的问题”。
    艾奇逊认为美国决定用美国军队帮助蒋介石“保卫”中国沿海岛屿是“可怕的”。他说，美国政府已经“不智地”陷入了“无望的境地”，“失去了对于局势的控制”，他说，美国“政府的态度是这样：在平静的时候不设法使我们从这种情况中脱出身来，而在危机的时候对此毫无办法。”他主张立即把蒋军从中国沿海岛屿撤回台湾。
    艾奇逊还建议美国政府在远东问题上多和其他国家“头脑冷静的朋友”商议。
    曾任美国陆军部长和驻华大使的赫尔利少将5日也说，在苏联支持拥有六亿人口的中国的情况下，美国对中国大陆使用军队将是自杀。
