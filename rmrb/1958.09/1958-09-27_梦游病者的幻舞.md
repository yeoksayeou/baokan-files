Title: The Sleepwalker's Fantastical Dance

    According to legend, there was a sleepwalker who once regarded a towering roof ridge as a broad avenue, fantasizing about reaching a paradise of blooming flowers through this flat road. Once, he got up in the middle of the night, climbed onto the roof ridge, and strode swiftly, fully believing that he could reach that paradise in an instant. Unexpectedly, after only three or five steps, he lost his footing and fell from the roof, smashing his head, splattering his brains, and dying silently at the foot of the wall!
    Today, the American imperialism's aggressive mania is exactly the same as that of this sleepwalker! Soon after the liberation of the Chinese mainland, the American imperialists, on one hand, occupied our Taiwan and, on the other hand, launched the war of aggression against Korea, fantasizing about attacking the Chinese mainland from both the north and the south through these two "broad" avenues, occupying the paradise they had dreamed of. However, they did not anticipate that their first foot would step into a trap—suffering a severe blow on the Korean battlefield from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, almost unable to pull their feet out and being buried on the Korean battlefield.
    However, the American imperialists did not seriously remember the lessons of their dejected and wounded retreat in Korea, and wake up from the dream of invading China. Today, they are stirring up trouble again in the Taiwan Strait area of our country, fantasizing about achieving the goal of seizing the paradise of New China. Their reason, in Eisenhower's words, is that the Chinese territories of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the coastal islands such as Kinmen and Matsu are "extremely important to the security of the United States and the free world." Furthermore, the American Congress has already granted him the so-called "power" to invade our coastal islands. This is the "basis" for the American imperialists to launch this sleepwalker-like mad behavior. This absurd "thought" of theirs is based on the so-called "deterrent power" and "policy of strength" touted by American aggressors. Lunatics like Eisenhower have the illusion that as long as American gunboats and aircraft are brought in, the Taiwan Strait and the Chinese coast will become "broad" avenues, allowing him to smoothly step towards "paradise." This is completely a fantasy. Because, in fact, the six hundred million Chinese people have long been united around the people's regime led by the Chinese Communist Party, establishing a powerful New China. For nine years, the industrial and agricultural production of New China has been leaping forward rapidly, reaching an unprecedented peak. The people of New China are all living a peaceful, happy, and free life. More than thirty countries around the world (including more than one billion people) have recognized New China. The powerful Soviet people and the entire socialist camp are giving the Chinese people the greatest support. Even the people of those countries who are coerced by American imperialism and dare not recognize New China are enthusiastically yearning for New China and trying their best to establish friendship with the Chinese people. In this war provocation by American imperialism, the people of the world have expressed their firm support for the Chinese people and opposition to the interference of American aggressors. These universally known facts all prove that the Chinese people are stronger than ever before compared to nine years ago; while the American imperialists are far more isolated than they were during the invasion of Korea. It is even more difficult for them to piece together an invasion force of sixteen countries like they did a few years ago. Anyone with a slightly clearer mind can compare and conclude that the Taiwan Strait and the Chinese coastal areas are "roof ridges" even higher than those of Korea a few years ago.
    If the American imperialists do not wake up as soon as possible and continue to engage in this dance in a dream, then they will surely fall and be smashed to pieces. Sleepwalkers cannot have another fate!

    梦游病者的幻舞
    以群
    据传说，有一个患梦游病的人，曾经把高耸的屋脊当作广阔的大道，幻想通过这条平坦的大道到达百花盛开的乐园；有一次，他半夜起来，爬上屋脊，飞步疾走，满以为瞬息之间就可以到达那个幻想中的乐园，不意才走了三五步，就失足从屋顶上掉了下来，跌得头破血流，脑浆迸裂，无声无息地死在墙脚下！
    今天，美帝国主义所患的侵略狂病恰恰是和这个梦游病患者一样的！早在中国大陆解放之后不久，美帝国主义者就一面侵占了我国的台湾，一面发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，幻想通过这两条“康庄”大道，南北两路夹击中国大陆，占领它梦寐以求的乐园。它却没有料想到第一脚就踩到了陷坑里去——在朝鲜战场上遭到了朝鲜人民军和中国志愿军的痛击，险些拔脚不出，葬送在朝鲜战场上。
    可是，美帝国主义者并没有认真记取在朝鲜垂头丧气、负伤败退的教训，而从侵略中国的梦幻中醒来。今天它又在我国的台湾海峡地区兴风作浪，幻想达到霸占新中国这个乐园的目的。它的理由，用艾森豪威尔的话说来是：中国领土台湾、澎湖列岛和金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，“对于美国和自由世界的安全是极其重要的”。再有就是说美国的国会已经授给了他侵略我国沿海岛屿的所谓“权力”。这就是美帝国主义者发动这次梦游病患者似的疯狂行为的“根据”。它这个荒谬“思想”是以美国侵略者吹嘘的所谓“威慑力量”和“实力政策”作基础的。艾森豪威尔之流的狂人有这么一种错觉，好像只要搬来了美国的炮舰和飞机，台湾海峡和中国沿海便会变成“康庄”大道，任他平稳地踏向“乐园”去了。这完全是一种幻梦。因为事实上，中国六亿人民早已团结在中国共产党所领导的人民政权周围，建立了一个强大的新中国。九年以来，新中国的工业和农业生产飞快地跃进，已经达到了史无前例的高峰；新中国的人民都过着和平、幸福、自由的生活。全世界三十多个国家（包括十亿以上的人民），都已承认了新中国；强大的苏联人民和整个社会主义阵营，都给中国人民以最大的支持。连那些受着美帝国主义的胁迫而不敢承认新中国的国家的人民，也热情地向往着新中国，千方百计地想和中国人民建立友谊。在这次美帝国主义的战争挑衅中，全世界人民都已表示坚决支持中国人民而反对美国侵略者的干涉。这些举世皆知的事实，都证明着中国人民比起九年前来要空前的强大；而美帝国主义者却远比在侵略朝鲜时更为孤立。它现在要想再拼凑起几年前那样一支十六国组成的侵略部队来也更困难了。头脑稍为清醒一点的人，都可以比较得出：台湾海峡和中国沿海地区，是比几年前的朝鲜更为高峻的“屋脊”。
    美帝国主义者如果不及早醒悟过来，一再继续进行着这种梦中的跳舞，那么，它一定会跌得粉身碎骨。梦游病患者是不可能有另一种命运的！
