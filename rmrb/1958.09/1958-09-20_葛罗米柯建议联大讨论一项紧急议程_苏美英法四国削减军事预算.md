Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 19th: Gromyko, the head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, wrote a letter to the President of the General Assembly requesting that the following item be included in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly as an urgent and important issue: "On the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France each reducing their military budgets by 10% to 15% and using the funds saved to help underdeveloped countries."

    The explanatory memorandum on this proposal states that the importance and urgency of solving this problem are becoming more obvious because the increasingly large military budgets caused by the continued expansion of armaments have a negative impact on the economic development and international trade of all countries and are a heavy burden on the people of all countries. The reduction of military budgets by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France would be an important practical step in stopping the arms race and freeing people from the increasing burden of military spending. The funds saved can be used to develop their own peaceful economies, and a portion of the funds can also be used to develop the economies of underdeveloped countries.

    The explanatory memorandum of this proposal also points out that the Soviet government put forward this proposal also taking into account that intertwining the issue of reducing military budgets with other disarmament issues would hinder the solution of this problem. In order to facilitate reaching an agreement on this issue, the Soviet government proposed that the issue of reducing the military budgets of various countries be discussed as a separate agenda item of the General Assembly.

    The proposal submitted by the Soviet Union is as follows:

    The General Assembly,

    Noting that the ever-increasing military expenditures, which are a sign of continued arms expansion, are disrupting the economies of many countries and lowering the living standards of the people,

    Points out that reducing military expenditures can promote the easing of the arms race and international tension, and at the same time, it can not only reduce the tax burden, but also allocate large sums of money to assist underdeveloped countries,

    Recommends that the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France undertake the obligation to reduce their military budgets by at least 10% to 15%;

    Calls on the aforementioned countries to allocate a portion of the funds saved from reducing military budgets to assist underdeveloped countries and to realize the most urgent economic and industrial development plans of underdeveloped countries.

    葛罗米柯建议联大讨论一项紧急议程
    苏美英法四国削减军事预算
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社纽约19日讯：苏联出席联合国大会的代表团团长葛罗米柯写给大会主席一封信，要求把下述项目作为紧急而重要的问题列入本届大会议程：“关于苏联、美国、英国和法国各削减军事预算10％到15％，并且利用节省下来的资金帮助不发达国家”。
    在对这一建议的说明书中说，由于继续扩张军备所引起的日益庞大的军事预算对各国的经济和国际贸易的发展起着不良影响，并且是压在各国人民肩上的沉重负担，解决这个问题的重要性和迫切性是更加明显了。苏联、美国、英国和法国削减军事预算会成为在停止军备竞赛和使人民摆脱日益加重的军费负担方面的一个重要的实际步骤。节省下来的资金除了可以用来发展本国的和平经济以外，还可以把一部分资金用来发展不发达国家的经济。
    这项建议的说明书还指出，苏联政府提出这个建议还考虑到，把削减军事预算的问题同裁军的其他问题纠缠在一起就会妨碍这个问题的解决，为了便于就这个问题达成协议，苏联政府建议把缩减各国军事预算的问题当作大会的一项独立的议程进行讨论。
    苏联提出的提案如下：
    大会，
    注意到，作为继续扩充军备的标志的日益庞大的军费开支使得许多国家的经济紊乱，人民的生活水平下降，
    指出，缩减军费开支能促使军备竞赛和国际紧张局势缓和，同时不仅能减轻赋税负担，而且可以拨出大笔资金援助不发达国家，
    建议苏联、美国、英国和法国政府承担至少缩减军事预算10％至15％的义务；
    呼吁上述国家拨出因缩减军事预算而节省下来的资金的一部分，用来援助不发达国家，用来实现不发达国家的最紧迫的经济和工业发展计划。
