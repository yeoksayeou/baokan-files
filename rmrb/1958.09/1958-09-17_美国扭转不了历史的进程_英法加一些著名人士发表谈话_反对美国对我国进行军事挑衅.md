Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from New York: British Air Vice-Marshal Sir John Slessor, former French Premier Paul Reynaud, and Oakley Dalgleish, editor of the Canadian "Toronto Globe and Mail," spoke to reporters from the U.S. National Broadcasting Company, expressing their opposition to the U.S. policy of military provocations against China. Their remarks were broadcast on the network's television program on the 14th.

    Slessor stated that he believed the U.S. preparation to use force to interfere with China's liberation of Jinmen and Mazu was "not well-founded." He said the British feeling was that the United States was "being very unreasonable now." He believed that any U.S. military action in the Taiwan Strait area would "seriously threaten" the "unity" between the U.S. and Britain. He expressed doubt as to whether the U.S. would have any allies if a war with China were to break out.

    Former French Premier Reynaud said in his talk, "Let us face the fact that China has a strong and stable government," and that trying "to reverse the course of history is dangerous." Reynaud believes that the Americans must take Khrushchev's warning about attacking China meaning an attack on the Soviet Union seriously. He said that if anyone thinks Khrushchev is not serious, then that person is naive.

    Dalgleish said that the Chiang Kai-shek group is just "an artificially assembled government, a government built from an army of desperadoes, an army of the defeated."

    美国扭转不了历史的进程
    英法加一些著名人士发表谈话
    反对美国对我国进行军事挑衅
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：英国空军少将约翰·斯莱瑟爵士、法国前总理保罗·雷诺、加拿大“多伦多环球邮报”主编奥克利·达格利希对美国全国广播公司记者发表了反对美国对中国进行军事挑衅的政策的谈话，他们的谈话14日在这家广播公司的电视节目中播送。
    斯莱瑟表示，他认为美国准备用武力干涉中国解放金门和马祖是“没有充分理由的”。他说，英国人的感觉是美国“现在非常没有道理”。他认为，美国在台湾海峡地区采取任何军事手段都将“严重威胁”到美英两国的“团结”。他表示怀疑，如果一旦同中国打起仗来，美国是否会有盟国。
    法国前总理雷诺在谈话中说，“让我们正视这样一个事实：中国有着一个强大而稳定的政府”，要想“扭转历史的进程是危险的”。雷诺认为，美国人必须认真对待赫鲁晓夫关于进攻中国就是进攻苏联的警告。他说，要是有任何人认为赫鲁晓夫说的不是当真的话，那么这个人就是幼稚的。
    达格利希说，蒋介石集团只是“一个人工拼凑的政府，一个从一支亡命者的军队、一支败军中建立起来的政府”。
