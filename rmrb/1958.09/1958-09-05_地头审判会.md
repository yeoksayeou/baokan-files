　　Field Trial Meeting
　　The villagers of Zhai Tang Township in Mentougou are very proud of a group of young "judges" who have moved the court to the fields and the kangs (heated brick beds), handling disputes and lawsuits accurately, steadily, and quickly. These "judges" are graduating students from the Law Department of the Renmin University of China who are interning at the Mentougou District People's Court.
　　One afternoon, the students, entrusted by the Mentougou District People's Court of Beijing, had just arrived in Zhai Tang Township when they received such a case: A couple often quarreled and both demanded a divorce. Student Liu Lu hurried to inquire with witnesses. The witness, Shi Ruqin, was always reluctant to say much. Liu Lu helped Shi Ruqin's family carry water and sweep the yard, and then worked in the fields together. Shi Ruqin felt that these "foreign students" were very kind and capable, so she told the whole story of the divorcing parties.
　　The next day, during a break from field work, the "judges" gathered the parties involved, witnesses, and neighbors together, and the "field trial meeting" began. Liu Lu resolved the long-standing misunderstanding between the parties. Both were deeply moved. The woman said that she would ensure to do her housework well to support her husband in production. The man said that he would no longer doubt his wife's love.
　　The students learned many things from practice that were not in the textbooks. When talking about their experiences, the students said that by working and listening to the opinions of the masses, and then holding field trial meetings, there are many people present, and many witnesses, and neither the defendant nor the plaintiff can deliberately fabricate lies or fabricate facts. This avoids the error of "subjective conjecture" in "sitting in court for interrogation," and the trial process is greatly shortened, without affecting production. (Zhu Jigong)

　　地头审判会
    门头沟斋堂乡的老乡们，很夸耀一群年轻的“审判员”，他们把法庭搬到地头、炕头来了，受理纠纷、诉讼又准、又稳、又快。这些“审判员”，是中国人民大学法律系来到门头沟区人民法院实习的应届毕业学生。
    一个晌午，学生们接受北京门头沟的区人民法院委托，刚到斋堂乡就受理了这样一件案子：有一对夫妇时常闹别扭，都要求离婚。学生刘路赶忙去向证人打听。证人史瑞琴总是不愿多讲。刘路帮着史瑞琴家担水、扫起院子来，又一块到田里干活。史瑞琴感到这帮“洋学生”挺亲切、挺能干，就把离婚当事人的底细原原本本给讲了。
    第二天，乘田间劳动的间歇，“审判员”们把当事人、证人和左邻右舍的群众召集在一起，“地头审判会”就开始了。刘路为当事人排解了长久以来的误会，双方都深深地受到了感动，女的说，保证做好家务工作，支援爱人搞生产。男的表示不再怀疑妻子的爱情了。
    学生们从实践中了解了很多书本上没有的道理。在谈到自己的体会时，学生们说，边劳动，边听取群众的意见，然后开地头审判会，群众多，证人多，被告和原告都不可能故意编派谎言或捏造事实，可以避免在“坐堂审问”中“主观臆断”的错误，审判的过程也大大缩短，不影响生产。　（朱继功）
