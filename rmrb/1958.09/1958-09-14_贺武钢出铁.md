Congratulating the Iron Output of Wuhan Iron and Steel

    The first furnace of iron flowed smoothly yesterday from the No. 1 blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, China's most modern large blast furnace. While the entire nation is busily building thousands upon thousands of small, indigenous, and combined indigenous-foreign blast furnaces, the news of the world-class Wuhan Iron and Steel's large blast furnace going into production marks the great victory of the general line for socialist construction in our country.
    Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee proposed long ago that large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises should be developed simultaneously in China's industrial development. The general line for socialist construction adopted by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of our Party in May this year clearly emphasized the policy of building large enterprises and building small and medium-sized enterprises simultaneously in our country. From then until now, in less than four months, the face of China's metallurgical industry has been completely renewed. We not only have small blast furnace groups like those in Lushan County, Henan, that produce more than 1,000 tons of pig iron per day, but also the large blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel that produces 2,000 tons of pig iron per day. Now the people of the whole country are still fully engaged in the construction of various types of blast furnaces, with thousands of small blast furnaces being put into production every day, and hundreds of medium-sized blast furnaces with a volume of 100 to 500 cubic meters and large blast furnaces with a volume of more than 500 cubic meters are also being constructed at an unprecedented speed. The prosperous scene of the construction of small, medium, and large blast furnaces once again powerfully proves the correctness of the policy of developing large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously, as pointed out by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. We are confident that we can double steel production this year to reach 10.7 million tons, one of the main reasons being that we have implemented this policy, which greatly promotes the speed of construction, in blast furnace construction.
    Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation is one of the several large iron and steel bases built in China after Anshan. It is a highly modernized iron and steel complex built with the help of the Soviet Union and is one of China's backbone factories. The early completion of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation will greatly promote the economic development of Central China, increase China's steel production, and especially increase the variety of steel products. The commissioning of its No. 1 blast furnace marks a new stage in the construction of this iron and steel base.
    Construction of the No. 1 blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel began in July last year. At that time, it was planned to be completed and put into production on July 1, 1959. After construction began, it was precisely the period when the people of our country were carrying out the great rectification movement. With the improvement of the consciousness of the workers and staff, the transformation of the leadership style, the improvement of construction organization, and the innovation of construction technology, the construction period was repeatedly accelerated, and it was to produce iron ahead of schedule at the end of this year. In February this year, encouraged by the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, all the workers and staff unanimously proposed to strive to produce iron on October 1, as a gift to the National Day. Now they have not only fulfilled their promise, but also brought it forward by eighteen days. The entire project took only fourteen months, and if the time spent waiting for equipment and materials during the construction period is deducted, it actually took only twelve months. It should be said that this is a very fast speed.
    When our country announced that the time for putting the No. 1 blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel into production would be brought forward to October 1 this year, both at home and abroad, some people did not believe that we could do it. Some spokesmen of the Western bourgeoisie hoped with malicious eyes that our plan would fail. Nevertheless, these doubters cannot be considered completely unfounded. It is indeed an extremely arduous task to master the complex technology of the world's first-class blast furnace construction in such a short period of time, and to complete the manufacture of 15,000 tons of metal structures, the manufacture and installation of 70,000 tons of equipment, the laying of 108 kilometers of pipelines, and the pouring of 200,000 cubic meters of concrete. There are many difficulties. But the question is how people deal with difficulties. For cowardly people, difficulties seem insurmountable. However, the workers in our country under the leadership of our Party are fearless people who despise difficulties. They work hard in the scorching heat and severe winter, regardless of wind and rain, and quickly master all the complex technologies with the help of Soviet experts. In addition, with the support of the people of the whole country and the enthusiastic assistance of the Soviet people, the blast furnace was put into production not on schedule, but ahead of schedule. Those Western bourgeoisies who do not believe that we have the ability to complete the blast furnace before October 1, of course, cannot understand the infinite power of the people of our country under the socialist system, nor can they understand the heroic spirit of the people of our country to do what they say, and even less can they understand the tremendous power generated by the people of our country after the rectification, especially under the guidance of Chairman Mao's breaking superstitions and emancipating the mind, and developing the communist style. Therefore, it is not surprising that the predictions of these people have completely failed.
    Before the rectification movement, some comrades also had a kind of superstition about the construction speed of large factories. These comrades believed that the technology of large factories is complex and the amount of work is large. Not only should there be a long preparation time before construction, but also the so-called regular construction methods such as underground first, then above ground, outside the factory first, then inside the factory, no construction without complete drawings, and three months of preparation before construction after the drawings arrive must be followed. Therefore, when talking about the construction of large iron and steel bases at that time, it was always "two years of design and five years of construction"; when talking about the construction period of large blast furnaces, it could not be less than twenty months. In the process of construction, with the gradual emancipation of their minds, the comrades of Wuhan Iron and Steel broke the rules, working while the drawings were arriving, modifying while constructing, working inside the factory first if there were drawings inside the factory, and working outside the factory first if there were drawings outside the factory. This saved time. In the construction process, Wuhan Iron and Steel merged the two institutions of Party A and Party B, implemented unified leadership, and broke the superstition that basic construction must have Party A and Party B establish a "contract relationship" in order to supervise each other. Facts have proved that because the leadership is unified, not only a large amount of manpower is saved, but also all the workers and staff are unified in thought and action under the leadership of a Party organization, fundamentally eliminating the phenomenon of mutual involvement between Party A and Party B in the past, greatly promoting the acceleration of construction speed and the reduction of cost. Under the vigorous situation of ideological emancipation, the superstition that the so-called "complex technology" is not easy to master has also been eliminated.
    The No. 1 blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel can be put into production ahead of schedule. In addition to the efforts of all the workers and staff of Wuhan Iron and Steel, the support of the people of the whole country and the Soviet people has played a great role. More than 200 manufacturing plants in 18 provinces and cities took the initiative to deliver goods ahead of schedule when they heard that Wuhan Iron and Steel was going to be put into production ahead of schedule. Many factories regarded the manufacture of Wuhan Iron and Steel blast furnace equipment as the primary political task to complete. Dozens of manufacturing plants in the Soviet Union also rushed to manufacture equipment for Wuhan Iron and Steel blast furnace day and night. In this way, with the enthusiastic support of domestic and Soviet countries, all the equipment was transported in advance, ensuring the realization of the plan for the blast furnace to produce iron ahead of schedule. Basic construction in our country, from design, equipment manufacturing, construction to putting into production, requires the joint efforts of many institutions and enterprises. To solve the problem of cooperation in many aspects, it is not靠 "law", nor is it only靠 contract, but mainly靠 the communist spirit of everything for the overall benefit. This has been proved once again in the construction process of the No. 1 blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel.
    Wuhan Iron and Steel Base is only one of the large iron and steel bases in our country; the No. 1 blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel is only one of the large blast furnaces in our country. The enthusiasm it showed in the construction and the experience it created in accelerating the progress of the project have a significant promotion effect on the construction of other large iron and steel enterprises. The construction of large iron and steel enterprises and all large basic construction projects are projects that attract the attention of the whole country. Everyone eagerly hopes that these projects can be done more, faster, better, and more economically. Since the No. 1 blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel can shorten the construction period again and again, we have reason to believe that all other large iron and steel enterprises and all large basic construction projects can shorten their construction period, be completed ahead of schedule, and put into production. Moreover, we also have reason to believe that all these projects, as long as politics is in command, all workers and staff have sufficient energy, strive for the upper reaches, break superstitions, and liberate the mind, and all relevant units develop the communist spirit of cooperation, will surely surpass others and build faster, better, and more economically than Wuhan Iron and Steel.

    贺武钢出铁
    我国最近代化的大型高炉，武汉钢铁公司第一号高炉，昨天顺利地流出了第一炉铁水。当全国正在紧张地建设成千成万的土的和土洋结合的小型高炉的时候，又传来了具有世界第一流水平的武钢大高炉投入生产，这标志着我国社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利。
    毛主席和党中央在很久以前，就提出了我国工业发展上大型企业要和中小型企业同时并举。今年5月间我党第八次代表大会第二次会议所通过的社会主义建设总路线，又明确地强调指出我国建设大型企业和建设中小型企业同时并举的方针。从那时到现在，时间不到四个月，我国冶金工业的面貌，就焕然一新。我们不但有了像河南鲁山县那样日产生铁一千多吨的小高炉群，而且也有了日产生铁二千吨的武钢大高炉。现在全国人民还在全力建设各式各样的高炉，每天都有成千的小高炉投入生产，上百的容积一百立方公尺到五百立方公尺的中型高炉和五百立方公尺以上的大型高炉也正在以空前速度进行建设。小型、中型、大型高炉建设的繁荣景象，再一次有力地证明了毛主席和党中央所指出的大中小企业同时并举方针的正确。我们有信心今年把钢的产量翻一番，达到一千零七十万吨，主要原因之一就是因为我们在高炉建设上执行了这一个大大促进建设速度的方针。
    武汉钢铁公司是我国继鞍山之后建设的几个大钢铁基地之一，它是苏联帮助我国建设的高度近代化的钢铁联合企业，是我国骨干工厂之一。武汉钢铁公司早日建成，对促进华中地区经济发展，对提高我国钢铁产量，特别是对增加我国钢材品种，都有很大的作用。它的一号高炉投入生产，是这个钢铁基地的建设已进入一个新阶段的标志。
    武钢一号高炉是去年7月开始动工修建的。当时准备在1959年7月1日建成投入生产。开工以后，正是我国人民进行伟大整风运动的时期，随着职工觉悟的提高，领导作风的转变，施工组织的改进和施工技术的革新，工期一再跃进，要提前在今年年底出铁。今年2月间，全体职工在工农业大跃进的形势鼓舞下，一致提出要争取在10月1日出铁，向国庆献礼。现在他们不仅实现了自己的诺言，而且又提前了十八天。整个工程只用了十四个月，如果把施工期间因等设备、材料而停工的时间除掉，实际只用了十二个月。应当说这是一个很快的速度。
    当我国宣布要把武钢一号高炉投入生产的时间提前到今年10月1日的时候，无论国内国外都有人不相信我们能作到这一点。其中有些西方资产阶级的代言人带着恶意的眼光希望我们的计划落空。尽管如此，却不能认为这些怀疑者是毫无根据的。的确要在这样短时期内掌握这个世界上第一流的高炉建设的复杂技术，和完成一万五千吨金属结构的制造、七万吨设备的制造及安装、一百零八公里管道的敷设、二十万立方公尺的混凝土的浇灌，是一个极其艰巨的任务。困难是很多的。可是问题在于人们怎样对待困难。对于懦弱的人来说，困难看起来是不可克服的。但是，在我们党的领导下的我国工人，却是蔑视困难的大无畏的人，他们不管酷暑严冬，不顾风吹雨打，刻苦钻研，昼夜苦战，在苏联专家的帮助下，很快地掌握了全部复杂技术，再加上全国人民的支援和苏联人民的热情援助，结果，不是按期，而是提前投入生产。那些不相信我们有能力在10月1日以前建成高炉的西方资产阶级，他们当然根本不能理解在社会主义制度下我国人民无穷无尽的力量，也根本不理解我国人民说到哪里就做到哪里的豪迈气概，更不能理解我国人民在整风以后，特别是在毛主席的破除迷信、解放思想的教导下发扬共产主义风格所产生的巨大力量。因此这些人的预料的完全失败，是毫不奇怪的。
    在整风运动以前，也有一些同志，对大型工厂的建设速度确有一种迷信。这些同志认为，大厂技术复杂，工程量又大，不但在施工前要有很长时间的准备，就是在施工的时候也必须照例按照先地下、后地上，先厂外，后厂内，图纸不全不施工，图纸到后准备三个月才施工等所谓正规的施工方法。因此，那时一谈到大型钢铁基地的建设，总是“二年设计、五年建设”；一谈到大型高炉的工期，总不能少于二十个月。武钢的同志们在建设过程中，随着思想的逐渐解放，打破了常规，边到图、边施工，边施工、边修改，厂内有图先干厂内，厂外有图就先干厂外。这样就赢得了时间。武钢在建设过程中合并了甲、乙两方机构，实行统一领导，破除了基本建设必须有甲乙两方建立“承包关系”，才能互相监督的迷信。事实证明，由于领导统一了，不但节省了大批人力，而且使全体职工在一个党组织领导下，思想一致、行动一致，根本上消除了过去甲、乙两方面互相牵扯的现象，大大促进了建设速度的加快和造价的降低。在思想解放势如破竹的形势下，所谓“技术复杂”不容易掌握的迷信，也跟着破除了。
    武钢一号高炉能够提前投入生产，除了武钢全体职工努力以外，全国人民和苏联人民的支援，起了极大的作用。十八个省市二百多家制造厂听说武钢要提前投入生产，都主动提前交货。许多工厂都把制造武钢高炉设备当作首要的政治任务来完成。苏联的几十个制造厂也日夜为武钢高炉赶制设备。这样，在国内和苏联热情支援下，全部设备都提前运到，保证了高炉提前出铁计划的实现。我国基本建设从设计、设备制造、施工到投入生产，需要许多机构、企业共同努力。要解决许多方面的协作问题，不是靠“法律”，也不是只靠合同，而主要的是靠一切为着整体利益的共产主义精神。这一点在武钢一号高炉的建设过程中，再一次得到了证明。
    武汉钢铁基地，不过是我国大型钢铁基地之一；武钢一号高炉不过是我国大型高炉之一。它在施工中所表现的干劲和所创造的加快工程进度的经验，对其他大型钢铁企业的建设都有着重大的促进作用。大型钢铁企业的建设和一切大型基本建设工程，是举国瞩目的工程，大家都迫切地希望这些工程能够干得又多又快又好又省。武钢一号高炉既然能一再缩短工期，我们就有理由相信其他所有大型钢铁企业和一切大型基本建设工程都能缩短自己的工期，提前竣工，投入生产。而且，我们也有理由相信，所有这些工程，只要政治挂帅，全体职工鼓足干劲、力争上游和破除迷信、解放思想，各有关单位发扬共产主义协作精神，一定会后来居上，比武钢建设得更快、更好、更省。
