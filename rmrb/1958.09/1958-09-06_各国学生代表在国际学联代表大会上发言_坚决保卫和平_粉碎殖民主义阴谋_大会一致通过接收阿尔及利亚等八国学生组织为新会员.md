Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Student representatives and observers from fourteen countries and regions speaking at today's Fifth Congress of the International Student Union centered on resolutely opposing colonialism and imperialism and defending world peace. Representatives and observers emphasized that this is the most important task of the current world student movement, and firmly believe that as long as students from all countries unite with the people of all countries to fight together, any conspiracy of the colonialists and imperialists will be completely shattered, and lasting world peace will surely be achieved.

	Soviet representative Bugrov spoke first at today's meeting. In his speech, he clearly expressed the firm stance of Soviet students in defending world peace and supporting the national independence movement of colonial peoples. He said, "We once again declare our respect, sympathy, and support for the just struggles of students in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We congratulate the people of Iraq on their victory. We believe that in the near future we will be able to congratulate Algeria, Cyprus, Togo, Cameroon, and other colonial countries on their victory in their heroic national liberation struggles."

	Bugrov then said that the US-British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan has awakened all freedom-loving people. The Soviet people and university students angrily condemned the imperialist acts of aggression, and we demand the immediate withdrawal of American and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

	Bugrov severely condemned the US and British governments for continuing nuclear weapons tests in disregard of the wishes of the people of the world. He said that a large number of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests have caused great harm to mankind, and the people and youth of the world demand an end to this criminal act of playing with the fate of mankind. We believe that carrying out movements and activities to immediately stop atomic and hydrogen weapon tests is an important task for student organizations in all countries.

	Representatives from Romania, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic all stated in their speeches that the people and students of these countries fully support the just struggle of the people and students of colonial countries against colonialism, and persistently fight to defend world peace. Romanian representative Uliescu said that fighting to defend peace and oppose colonialism is the main issue of the present era, and we students should participate in this struggle and merge our strength into this struggle. Hungarian representative Hais Karoly said in his speech that the struggle to defend peace and oppose colonialism is indivisible, and both struggles have a common opposition to imperialism. We realize from our own personal experience that imperialism is the greatest threat to independent nations, because imperialism hates all people and all countries that have gained freedom and independence. We Hungarian students, under any circumstances, will always sympathize with and support the struggle of students in colonial countries for national independence. German Democratic Republic representative Horst introduced to the conference the heroic struggle of German youth against the US imperialists' equipping of the West German army with atomic weapons and against the militarization of West Germany. He also said that German youth firmly support the heroic struggle of students from all countries against imperialism and colonialism.

	Jordanian representative Ga Sa Abasi, in his speech, repeatedly thanked the International Student Union and the All-China Students' Federation on behalf of Jordanian students suffering in prisons and desert concentration camps for the sympathy and support they have shown to the Jordanian people in their struggle against British imperialist aggression and for national independence. Abasi proudly said, this is the first time we have been able to break through the shackles and get rid of isolation to cooperate with the world student movement.

	Abasi very indignantly condemned the British imperialism for enslaving and plundering the Jordanian people. He said, the British troops are robbers and thieves, they have taken everything from us, we cultivate the land and grow grains, and we cannot even afford to eat it; we have oil and gold, but we are forbidden to use it to benefit our people; we have many school buildings but they are used as prisons. We have cities and villages, but we have no right to live there, because those places are occupied by British troops who kill us, imprison us, and rob us. The desert concentration camps and prisons are full of patriots, and a large number of students have been arrested and exiled. Abasi also accused American imperialism and Israel of provocations and conspiracies against Jordan.

	Abasi appealed to the conference, demanding that foreign troops withdraw from Jordan and that the Jordanian people be liberated from the clutches of imperialism and reactionary agents.

	Abasi said, "We have the solidarity of the Arab countries and the powerful united front of the Arab national liberation movement, we have the spirit of the Bandung Conference, we have the support of the people of the world, and we are confident that we will completely defeat imperialism."

	After Abasi's speech, he presented gifts to the International Student Union and the All-China Students' Federation. Then Abasi and Hu Qili warmly embraced each other, expressing that the students of China and Jordan will always be friends and always stand together against imperialism.

	Cypriot representative George P. Hatzifanis at the conference accused the British colonialists of their bloody rule on the island of Cyprus and the extremely cruel persecution of the student movement. He said that on this island with a population of less than half a million, the British colonialists have 40,000 troops, 20,000 police officers, and many concentration camps. He asked the International Student Union to support the struggle of Cypriot students for dignity and freedom. At the same time, he pointed out that the purpose of the British colonialists' enslavement of the Cypriot people is to preserve its military bases and the plunder of Middle Eastern oil, that is, to carry out aggression against the Middle Eastern people. He firmly stated that the students of Cyprus will never allow their island to be used by British imperialism as a base for aggression against the Middle East.

	Burmese student representative Maung Zaw Win, in his speech, condemned the conspiracies and sabotage activities carried out by imperialists against newly independent countries. He said that imperialists are doing everything possible to infiltrate these countries. He said that the aggression activities carried out by the Chiang Kai-shek clique's troops in Burma with the support of US imperialism still threaten Burma's peace, security, and independence. He accused the United States of interfering in the internal affairs of Burma's neighbor, Indonesia. He emphasized that students should closely combine the struggle against imperialism with the struggle to safeguard national independence and fight for democratic education.

	The Venezuelan student representative, Ji Kameng, from distant Latin America, introduced to the conference the historical situation of their domestic student movement and the role of students in the struggle against imperialist interference and domestic autocratic dictatorship. He also emphasized that the victory achieved by the Chinese people through heroic struggle provided them with a good example.

	Representatives from Guadeloupe, Rotinik, Togo, and Guyana unanimously and angrily condemned the criminal acts of imperialists and colonialists in their speeches.

	Also speaking at today's meeting were representatives from Japan and observers from Laos.

	At today's meeting, all representatives unanimously approved the report on the results of the review of the qualifications of representatives made to the conference by the Credentials Committee of the conference.

	The conference also passed resolutions to admit the student organizations of Algeria, Togo, Hungary, Venezuela, and Jordan as official members of the International Student Union, the student organizations of Morocco and Ceylon as associate members, and the student organization of Iraq in the United Arab Republic as a consultative member.

	The conference will continue on the 6th.

    据新华社5日讯　坚决反对殖民主义和帝国主义、保卫世界和平，是来自十四个国家和地区的学生代表和观察员在今天举行的国际学联第五届代表大会上发言的中心。代表和观察员们强调地指出，这是目前世界学生运动头等重要的任务，并且坚信，只要各国学生同各国人民团结一致共同进行斗争，殖民主义者和帝国主义者的任何阴谋都将被彻底粉碎，世界的持久和平一定会实现。
    苏联代表布格洛夫在今天的大会上首先发言。他在发言中明确表示了苏联学生在保卫世界和平和支持殖民地人民争取民族独立运动的坚定立场。他说，我们再一次声明我们对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲学生的正义斗争的尊敬、同情和支持。我们祝贺伊拉克人民的胜利。我们相信，在不久的将来我们就可以向阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯、多哥、喀麦隆和其他殖民地国家祝贺他们在英勇的民族解放斗争中获得胜利。
    布格洛夫接着说，美英对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略唤醒了所有爱好自由的人民。苏联人民和大学生愤怒地痛斥帝国主义的侵略行为，我们要求美国和英国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    布格洛夫严厉地谴责了美英政府不顾全世界人民的愿望继续进行核武器试验的行为。他说，大量的原子弹和氢弹试验给人类带来极大的危害，全世界人民和青年都要求结束这种玩弄人类命运的罪恶行为。我们认为，开展为立刻停止原子武器和氢武器试验的运动和活动是世界各国学生组织的重要工作。
    来自罗马尼亚、匈牙利和德意志民主共和国的代表在发言中都表示这些国家的人民和学生全力支持殖民地国家人民和学生反对殖民主义的正义斗争，并且坚持不懈地为保卫世界和平而斗争。罗马尼亚代表乌里耶斯柯说，为了保卫和平和反对殖民主义而进行斗争是现今时代的主要问题，我们学生应该参加这个斗争，把自己的力量汇合到这个斗争中去。匈牙利代表海斯·卡洛里在发言中说，保卫和平和反对殖民主义的斗争是不能分割的，这两个斗争都有着反对帝国主义的共同性，我们从自己的切身经历中认识到帝国主义是各民族独立国家的最大威胁。因为帝国主义憎恨所有的人民，憎恨所有获得自由和独立的国家。我们匈牙利学生在任何情况下，都是永远同情和支持殖民地国家学生争取民族独立的斗争，德意志民主共和国代表霍尔斯特向大会介绍了德国青年反对美帝国主义用原子武器装备西德军队和反对西德军国主义化的英勇斗争。他并且说，德国青年是坚决支持各国学生反对帝国主义和殖民主义的英勇斗争的。
    约旦代表加·萨·阿巴西在发言中代表在监狱和沙漠集中营中受折磨的约旦学生一再感谢国际学联和中华全国学生联合会对约旦人民在反对英帝国主义侵略和争取民族独立斗争中所表示的同情和支援。阿巴西自豪地说，这是我们第一次能够冲破枷锁摆脱孤立的状态与世界学生运动进行合作。
    阿巴西非常愤慨地谴责了英国帝国主义对约旦人民进行的奴役和掠夺。他说，英国军队是强盗，是贼，他们拿去了我们的每一件东西，我们耕地，种谷，自己都吃不上；我们有石油和黄金，但是我们被禁止去利用来造福我们的人民；我们有许多学校的建筑物却被当作监狱使用。我们有城市和乡村，但是我们没有权利去居住在那里，因为那些地方被杀我们、关我们和抢我们的英国军队占据了。在沙漠集中营和监狱里充满了爱国者，大批学生被逮捕、流亡。阿巴西同时还指责了美国帝国主义和以色列对约旦的挑衅和阴谋活动。
    阿巴西向大会呼吁，要求外国军队从约旦撤退，使约旦人民从帝国主义及反动代理人的魔掌中解放出来。
    阿巴西说，我们有着阿拉伯国家的团结和阿拉伯民族解放运动的强大统一战线，我们有着万隆会议的精神，我们有世界各国人民的支持，我们有信心完全击败帝国主义。
    阿巴西讲话后向国际学联和中国学联赠送了礼物。接着阿巴西和胡启立热烈地拥抱在一起，表示中约两国学生永远友好，永远在一起反对帝国主义。
    塞浦路斯代表乔治·帕·哈其发尼斯在大会上控诉了英国殖民主义者在塞浦路斯岛上的血腥统治和对学生运动的极端残酷的迫害。他说，在这个人口不到五十万的岛上，英国殖民主义者拥有四万名军队，两万名警察和许多集中营。他要求国际学生联合会支援塞浦路斯学生争取尊严和自由的斗争。同时他又指出，英国殖民主义者奴役塞浦路斯人民的目的是要保住它的军事基地和对中东石油的掠夺，也就是要对中东人民进行侵略。他坚决表示，塞浦路斯的学生决不允许他们的岛屿被英国帝国主义当作侵略中东的基地。
    缅甸学生代表貌佐温在发言中谴责帝国主义者对新独立国家所进行的阴谋破坏活动。他说，帝国主义者正在用尽一切办法渗入到这些国家里去。他说，蒋介石集团的军队在美帝国主义支持下在缅甸进行的侵略活动，仍然威胁着缅甸的和平、安全和独立。他指责美国干涉缅甸的邻国印度尼西亚的内政。他强调指出，学生应该把反对帝国主义同维护民族独立和争取民主教育的斗争紧密结合起来。
    来自遥远的拉丁美洲的委内瑞拉的学生代表季·卡蒙，向大会介绍了他们国内学生运动的历史情况，学生在反对帝国主义干涉和国内专制独裁斗争中的作用。他并且强调说，中国人民经过英勇斗争而取得的胜利向他们提供了好榜样。
    瓜德罗浦、罗提尼克、多哥和圭亚那的代表在发言中一致愤怒地谴责了帝国主义者和殖民主义者的罪恶行为。
    在今天会上发言的还有日本的代表和老挝的观察员。
    在今天的大会上，全体代表一致通过了大会资格审查委员会向大会所作的关于代表资格审查结果的报告。
    大会还通过吸收阿尔及利亚、多哥、匈牙利、委内瑞拉和约旦的学生组织为国际学联的正式会员，摩洛哥和锡兰的学生组织为联系会员，伊拉克在阿拉伯联合共和国的学生组织为谘询资格会员。
