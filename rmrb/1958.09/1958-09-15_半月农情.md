Bi-Weekly Agricultural Situation
“Chushu” (August 23rd) – “Bai Lu” (September 8th)

During this period, some areas in the south suffered natural disasters of varying degrees. In coastal areas of Fujian, Zhejiang and other provinces, due to good prevention and resistance work, the damage was generally minor, except for a few counties. Most or parts of Jiangxi, Guangxi, Hunan and other provinces/regions have experienced autumn drought. The characteristics of this year's autumn drought here are: many points, small areas, and interspersed distribution. The single-season late rice and double-season late rice that are heading, filling, or tillering and pregnant with ears are most threatened by the autumn drought. Many areas have achieved great results in the fight against drought. As of September 3, the Nanchang area of Jiangxi province had rescued 1.18 million mu of drought-affected late rice, accounting for 75.8% of the total drought-affected area.

During this half-month, various regions continued to harvest mature autumn crops such as corn, millet, and sorghum. Summer-sown corn, millet, soybeans, peanuts, etc. in these areas are entering the late stage of growth. Strengthening the late-stage management of late autumn crops is an important activity in these areas.

Cotton-growing areas generally showed a bumper harvest in the initial harvest period. Most cotton-growing areas are carrying out new cotton picking and late-stage management at the same time in order to get more autumn bolls and strive for a greater harvest. Many production units have also paid attention to selecting and retaining high-quality cotton seeds.

Winter wheat areas generally began autumn sowing preparations after "Chushu," and a few areas have begun sowing winter wheat. Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and other provinces have started large-scale land preparation movements. Many counties have accumulated several times or even dozens of times more fertilizer for autumn sowing than last year. Yongcheng County in Henan Province has an average of 120,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu for 1.3 million mu of wheat fields. Many places in Jiangsu have reached the target of 5,000 dan of base fertilizer per mu of wheat field. Some areas have experienced a shortage of seeds due to the expansion of winter wheat area and the increase in sowing amount.

The late rice in the double-cropping rice area completed tillering before "Bai Lu". In the Chao-Shan area of Guangdong, in grasping the tillering of late rice, the experience of applying top dressing combined with "cutting the rice tail" to promote effective tillering was created. After many late rice fields adopted this method, the number of tillers increased by two or three times. In this stage, each late rice area, following "attacking tillers", immediately took measures such as top dressing, weeding, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests to "attack ears" and "attack grains."

Late tobacco, sugarcane and other cash crops are mostly in the vigorous growth period. Late tobacco in Guizhou, Shandong and other places has tall plants and many leaves, and it is expected that each mu can harvest 600 to 1,000 jin. In order to increase the yield per unit area, many tobacco areas have adopted the method of retaining top branches and bottom branches for early tobacco this year.

Sugarcane in most areas is growing luxuriantly, and the plants are generally taller than in the same period last year. Agricultural cooperatives and people's communes in these areas are strengthening the field management of this crop.

    半月农情
    “处暑”（8月23日）——“白露”（9月8日）
    南方一些地区在这个阶段受到不同程度的自然灾害。福建、浙江等省沿海一带在这次台风中由于防范和抗御工作进行得好，除少数县外，一般损害轻微。江西、广西、湖南等省、区的大部地区或部分地区已有秋旱出现。今年这里秋旱的特点是：点多，片小，分布插花。受秋旱威胁最大的是这一带正在抽穗灌浆或分蘖孕穗的单季晚稻和双季晚稻。许多地区在向干旱斗争中已取得重大成绩。江西南昌专区到9月3日共抢救了受旱晚稻一百十八万亩，占总受旱面积的75.8％。
    各地在这半个月里继续收获已经成熟的玉米、谷子、高粱等大秋作物。这些地区的夏播玉米、谷子和黄豆、花生等正进入生长后期。加强晚秋作物后期管理是这些地区的当前一项重要活动。
    各棉区在收获初期普遍呈现丰收景象。多数棉区为了多结秋桃，争取更大丰收，同时进行收摘新棉和后期管理。不少生产单位还注意了选留优良棉种。
    各冬麦区在“处暑”以后普遍开始了秋种准备工作，少数地区已开始播种冬麦。陕西、河南、河北、山东、江苏等省都开始了较大规模的翻地运动。许多县为秋种积聚了多于去年几倍甚至几十倍的肥料。河南永城县一百三十万亩麦田平均每亩已有底肥十二万斤。江苏不少地方已达到麦田亩施基肥五千担的指标。有些地区由于冬麦面积扩大和播种量的增多而产生种子不足的情况。
    双季稻区的晚稻在“白露”以前分蘖完了。广东潮汕地区在抓晚稻分蘖中，创造了追肥结合“剪禾尾”促进有效分蘖的经验。许多晚稻田采用了这种办法以后，分蘖数增加两、三倍。各晚稻区在这个阶段里继“攻分蘖”之后，紧接着采取了追肥、除草、防治病虫等措施“攻穗”“攻粒”。
    晚烟、甘蔗等经济作物多数入生长旺期。贵州、山东等地的晚烟株高叶多，预计每亩可收六百斤至千斤。不少烟区为了提高单位产量，今年对早烟都采取了留顶杈、留底杈的办法。
    多数地区的甘蔗生长茂盛，植株一般比去年同一时期为高。这些地区的农业社、人民公社正在加强这项作物的田间管理。
