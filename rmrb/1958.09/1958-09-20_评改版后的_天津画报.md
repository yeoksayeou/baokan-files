Review of the Revised "Tianjin Pictorial"
	Make
	The "Tianjin Pictorial" has published four issues since its revision in June of this year. Compared with the pictorial before the revision, there have been very prominent improvements in both content and form, meaning it is now more in line with the actual needs of the broad masses.

	I think the revised pictorial has two obvious characteristics. One is that it closely coordinates with various movements and promptly reflects the new people and new events in the local area. Each issue of the pictorial has distinctive local characteristics, with a certain number of comic strips, series of paintings, and special columns, which showcase the new atmosphere of Tianjin's urban construction and the advanced deeds of workers and peasants on the production front. These works are very eye-catching. For example, the great project of building the Tanggu Haihe Sluice is a major event in the lives of the people of Tianjin. The pictorial in the eighth issue had a special column on "Taming the Haihe River," using propaganda posters and sketches to quickly reflect the face of the construction site and the atmosphere of unity, mutual assistance, and intense struggle of the labor army in the construction. The ninth issue also published the comic strip "Iron Women's Squad," which specifically depicts the vivid story of Wu Shaoyun, a female member of an agricultural cooperative, leading women to actively participate in the transformation of the Haihe River project. This played a strong role in boosting labor enthusiasm and striving to complete the sluice project ahead of schedule. For another example, after Liang Shukai of the Tianjin Weaving and Dyeing Factory created the miracle of dyeing silk without dyes, the pictorial quickly published a comic strip about him; and when the residents of Hongshunli Street in Tianjin organized large-scale production, the pictorial matched it with relevant special columns. These works from real life generally have a convincing sense of reality, and the forms are lively and fresh, specifically expressing the people and things that people are concerned about in their lives, making people feel more cordial after reading them. But more importantly, these works rapidly reflect the advanced things that are constantly emerging in life in various art forms, so that advanced ideas can be disseminated in a timely manner, allowing readers to feel the pulse of the people in the Great Leap Forward in the works and smell the breath of the times. This practice of treating art as a weapon of propaganda and education should be continued in the future. Another feature of the "Tianjin Pictorial" is that it is oriented towards the workers, peasants, and soldiers, combined with the needs of mass art work, and each issue has a central content. In the four issues, there have been three special issues on murals, propaganda posters, and works depicting children's lives. The biggest advantage of this approach is that it is easy for readers to read and use. At present, many cities and rural areas across the country are carrying out mural movements, which on the one hand need to be widely popularized and continued; on the other hand, it is also necessary to gradually improve the quality of murals. In this situation where mural materials are very much needed, it is very timely for the pictorial to publish special issues of murals created by professional artists and the masses. The content of these murals includes calling on all people to run industries and the Great Leap Forward of worker-peasant cooperation; building water conservancy to transform nature and celebrating bumper harvests; and also learning culture, eliminating the four pests, and praising various new people and new styles, etc., all of which promote the Party's policies with relatively concise and vivid artistic images, and closely cooperate with the Great Leap Forward pace of the people across the country. At the same time, these paintings are all color-printed and are accompanied by short articles, which are very suitable for the masses to use for amateur learning and copying. In addition to special issues, each issue also has other interesting and rich works such as comic strips, series of paintings, novel illustrations, introductions, and workers' paintings. Therefore, the content of the pictorial is not monotonous due to the publication of special issues. On the contrary, the special issues make the content of the pictorial more substantial, achieving a prominent center, with both red flowers and green leaves, interspersed and set off each other, rich and colorful. The sixth issue, which focuses on works depicting children's lives, is a wonderful example. In the selection of special pages and the coordination of various forms of works, the unification of educational and appreciation requirements has been achieved, allowing readers to both increase their knowledge and receive education, and also obtain artistic appreciation satisfaction. With such a content-rich pictorial, it is no wonder that a friend living in a remote area wants me to buy several copies and send them to him no matter what.

	In recent years, various pictorials have been published in provinces and cities across the country, which have played a certain role in promoting industrial and agricultural production and meeting the cultural life requirements of the masses. At the same time, significant achievements have also been made in implementing the policy of art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, combining art and politics, and adhering to the work of popularizing art, making pictorials a central station for popularizing art creation, training mass art workers, and improving the artistic appreciation level of the masses. However, there are also individual pictorials that, due to unclear principles and objects, and a lack of in-depth practical and bold creative editing styles, and even some that do not pay attention to content but only change the external form, the content of the pictorial becomes empty and poor, lacks characteristics, and cannot leave a clear impression on readers. The experience of the revised "Tianjin Pictorial" once again proves that close cooperation with political movements, starting from reality, and having distinctive local characteristics are indispensable factors for a successful pictorial. Of course, as far as the "Tianjin Pictorial" is concerned, there are also areas that need to be improved. For example, not enough murals and general art works created by workers and peasants are selected; the content of some special columns is not rich enough, especially the artistic quality of some works that express real people and real events needs to be gradually improved; the arrangement and design should be more eye-catching and more beautiful, so that it truly achieves rich content and beautiful form. I believe that the "Tianjin Pictorial," as long as it continues to work hard on the existing basis, will truly become a pictorial that readers love to read.

    评改版后的“天津画报”
    马克
    “天津画报”从今年6月改版后已经出版四期了。如果和改版前的画报相比较，无论在内容或形式上都有很突出的改进，也就是说更加能符合广大群众的实际需要了。
    改版后的画报，我觉得有两大明显的特色。一个是紧密配合各项运动，及时反映当地的新人新事，每期画报中都具有鲜明的地方色彩，有一定数量的连环画、组画和专栏，是表现天津市区建设的新气象和工农群众在生产战线上的先进事迹的。这些作品很引人注目。例如塘沽海河建闸的伟大工程，是天津人民生活中的一件大事，画报在第八期就有“驯服海河”的专栏，以宣传画、速写迅速地反映了工地的面貌和施工中劳动大军团结互助、紧张战斗的热潮。第九期又发表了连环画“钢铁妇女连”，具体地描绘了农业社女社员吴少云带动妇女积极参加改造海河工程的生动事实。这对于鼓舞劳动热情，争取提前完成建闸工程起了有力的配合作用。再如天津织染厂梁树楷创造了不用染料染丝绸的奇迹后，画报很快就发表有关他的连环画；天津鸿顺里街道居民组织大搞生产，画报就配以有关的专栏。这些来自现实生活的作品，一般都具有令人信服的真实感，而且形式活泼新鲜，具体地表现了人们在生活中所关注的人和事，使人看后倍加亲切。但更重要的是，这些作品以各种艺术形式迅速反映了生活中不断涌现出的先进事物，使先进的思想及时得到了传播，让读者在作品中能感到人民在大跃进中脉搏的跳动，闻到时代的气息。这种把艺术当做宣传教育武器的做法，今后应该继续坚持。“天津画报”的另一特色是面向工农兵群众，结合群众美术工作的需要，每期都有中心内容。在四期中已有壁画、宣传画和表现儿童生活的作品三个专刊。这种做法最大的好处是便于读者阅读和使用。目前全国许多城市和农村都在开展壁画运动，一方面需要大量普及和继续开展；另方面也需要逐步提高壁画的质量。在这样非常需要壁画材料的情况下，画报出版专业画家和群众创作的壁画专刊是很适时的。这些壁画的内容有号召全民办工业和工农协作大跃进的；有兴修水利改造自然和庆祝大丰收的；也有学习文化、除四害和歌颂各种新人新风气的，等等，都以比较简练生动的艺术形象宣传了党的政策，和全国人民大跃进的脚步紧紧配合，同时这些画都是彩色印刷，又配合有简短的文章，很符合群众业余学习和临摹之用。除专刊外每期还有其他方面的连环画、组画、小说插图介绍和职工的画等丰富有趣的作品，因此并没有因为出专刊而使画报的内容单调，相反的有了专刊，使画报的内容显得更充实，做到了中心突出，有红花也有绿叶，相互穿插衬托，丰富多彩。以表现儿童生活作品为主的第六期，就是精彩的一例。在专页的编选和各种不同形式作品的配合方面，就做到了教育和欣赏要求的统一，让读者既能增加知识受到教育，又能得到艺术欣赏上的满足。像这样内容丰富的画报，难怪有位住在边远地区的朋友，要我无论如何一定买几本送给他。
    几年来，全国各省市都出版了各种各样的画报，在推动工农业生产和满足群众文化生活要求方面起了一定的作用。同时，在贯彻艺术为工农兵服务，艺术和政治相结合，坚持美术普及工作方面也有显著的成绩，使画报成为普及美术创作、培养群众美术工作者和提高群众艺术欣赏水平的一个中心站。但是，也有个别的画报，由于方针、对象不明确，又缺少深入实际和大胆创造的编辑作风，甚至有的还不重视内容只在外表形式上变来变去，因而画报的内容便空洞贫乏，缺少特色，不能给读者留下鲜明的印象。“天津画报”改版后的经验再次证明：紧密配合政治运动，从实际出发，并具有鲜明的地方特色，这是一本成功的画报不可缺少的因素。当然，就“天津画报”说，也有需要改进的地方。例如：对于工农群众创作的壁画和一般美术作品选用的还不多；有些专栏的内容还不够充实，特别是对一些表现真人真事的作品需要逐步提高艺术质量；在编排设计方面还应更加醒目、更加美观一些，使其真正达到内容丰富和形式美观。我相信，“天津画报”在现有的基础上只要不断努力，一定会真正成为一本读者爱不释手的画报。
