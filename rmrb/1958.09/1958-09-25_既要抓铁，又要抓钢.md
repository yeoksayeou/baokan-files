Grasping Iron and Steel Simultaneously
Yuan Hua

Steel and iron production are galloping forward like two steeds. Judging from the iron and steel production situation in the first 22 days of September, iron is progressing much faster than steel. Iron production increased by 43.3% compared to August, while steel production only increased by 14.6% compared to August; the average daily iron production is 1.78 times that of steel. This situation requires "steel" to spur itself to catch up with the speed of "iron." In the past, it was correct for local Party committees to concentrate their efforts on iron production to ensure raw materials for steelmaking. Now, in order to ensure that steel and iron advance side by side and leap forward together, local Party committees are required to grasp both iron and steel.

So, is it possible for the speed of steel to increase even faster?

We say it is entirely possible, because:

First, due to the fact that Party committees at all levels are leading thousands upon thousands of people to go up the mountains to mine and smelt iron, pig iron production has increased sharply, and the supply of pig iron is gradually improving. In addition, the achievements of the industrial "drought resistance" movement in various regions are tremendous, having collected more than 1.4 million tons of scrap steel, which guarantees sufficient "food" to feed the steelmaking furnaces.

Second, the existing steelmaking equipment still has great potential. The average utilization coefficient of open hearth furnaces nationwide is around eight, while the highest record recently created by No. 16 open hearth furnace in Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 2 Steel Plant is 19.1. If all open hearth furnaces in the country can learn from No. 16 open hearth furnace in Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 2 Steel Plant and increase the utilization coefficient from eight to 19.1, several million tons of steel can be produced, which is an astonishing figure. The distance between advanced indicators and the national average indicators for other electric furnaces and converters is also very large, and there is also great potential to be tapped.

Third, a large number of newly built steelmaking furnaces can be completed and put into production this year. From now until the end of the year, about 400 converters alone can be built, which can produce about 3 million tons of steel for the country. If various regions can seize the construction of converters, electric furnaces, and open hearth furnaces, and strive to put them into production as soon as possible, it will be a powerful new force.

With these positive factors, it shows that the objective possibility of accelerating the speed of steel production exists. However, to transform possibility into reality, it is also necessary to give full play to people's subjective initiative. This requires Party committees at all levels to grasp both iron and steel, like the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, and while continuing to firmly grasp iron production, vigorously grasp steel, mobilize all positive factors that can be mobilized, and promote a leap in steel production.

    既要抓铁，又要抓钢
    沅华
    钢和铁的生产正在像两匹骏马一样向前快跑。从9月份前二十二天的钢铁生产情况看来，铁的速度要比钢快得多，铁的产量比8月份增长了43.3％，而钢的产量只比8月份增长了14.6％；平均每天的铁产量等于钢产量的一点七八倍。这种形势，要求“钢”快马加鞭赶上“铁”的速度。过去，为了保证炼钢的原料，各地党委集中力量抓铁的生产是正确的；现在，为了保证钢和铁齐头并进、共同飞跃，就要求各地党委，既抓铁，又抓钢。
    那末，钢的速度有没有可能更快地增长呢？
    我们说，是完全有可能的。因为：
    第一，由于各地党委带领成千上万的人上山采矿炼铁，生铁产量急剧增长，生铁的供应情况正在逐渐好转。再加上各地工业“抗旱”运动成绩巨大，已经搜集了一百四十多万吨废钢铁，这就保证有足够的“粮食”喂饱炼钢炉。
    第二，现有的炼钢设备还有很大的潜力。全国平炉利用系数平均在八左右，而鞍钢第二炼钢厂十六号平炉最近创造的最高纪录是十九点一。如果全国所有的平炉都能向鞍钢第二炼钢厂十六号平炉看齐，利用系数从八提高到十九点一，就可以多增产几百万吨钢，这是一个惊人的数字。其他电炉和转炉的利用系数，先进指标和全国平均指标之间的距离也很大，也大有潜力可挖。
    第三，还有大批新建的炼钢炉可以在今年建成投入生产。从现在到年底，光是转炉就能建成四百座左右，大约可以给国家生产三百万吨钢。如果各地能够抓紧转炉、电炉、平炉的建设，力争尽快地投入生产，就是一支强大的生力军。
    有了这样一些积极因素，说明加快钢的生产速度的客观可能性是存在的，但是，要把可能性变为现实性，还需要充分发挥人的主观能动作用，这就要求各地党委，像山西省委那样既抓铁、又抓钢，在继续抓紧铁的生产的同时，大力抓钢，调动一切可以调动的积极因素，促进钢产量的飞跃。
