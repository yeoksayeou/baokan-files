Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th - Dahuofang Reservoir, the first giant water conservancy hub in the Northeast, was fully completed on September 5th. On this day, the builders, after four years of heroic labor, held a grand completion ceremony. Qiu Youwen, Vice Governor of Liaoning Province and Chairman of the National Acceptance Committee, announced at the meeting: After inspection and appraisal, the specifications and quality of the Dahuofang Reservoir project have fully met the design standards, and it was immediately handed over to the management department for use. At 1:00 PM, the Dahuofang Reservoir Administration ordered the opening of the floodgates. At this moment, the automatic winch in the hoist tower opened the steel gate weighing tens of thousands of pounds, and a powerful water flow of 300 meters per second suddenly rushed out of the water conveyance tunnel, rolling down the river in silvery waves.

This giant reservoir, built to fundamentally control the flood of the Hun River, one of the largest tributaries of the Liao River, was designed by our country itself. The dam body is 1,370 meters long and can store 2 billion cubic meters of water. Since it blocked floods in 1956, it has begun to exert the power of controlling water hazards. In the past two years, the people on both sides of the Hun River downstream have been spared the threat of floods that occur once every fifty years. In the future, even the great floods that occur once every hundred years will be tamed and stored in the reservoir. The Hun River irrigation area near Shenyang has been expanded due to the completion of the reservoir. A hydroelectric power station with an installed capacity of 32,000 kilowatts is also under intense construction on the reservoir. The Fushun Agricultural and Forestry Bureau breeding farm has also released more than 100,000 fish fry into the calm man-made lake. The industrial water use of the two major cities of Shenyang and Fushun will also be satisfied due to the completion of the reservoir.

### 东北第一座巨型水利枢纽  大伙房水库开闸放水

    东北第一座巨型水利枢纽
　　大伙房水库开闸放水
    新华社沈阳8日电　东北区第一座巨型水利枢纽——大伙房水库，9月5日全部竣工了。这天，经过四年英勇劳动的建设者们举行了盛大的竣工典礼。辽宁省副省长、国家验收委员会主任委员仇友文在大会上宣布：经过检查鉴定，大伙房水库工程规格、质量完全达到了设计标准，并当即移交管理部门使用。午后一点钟，大伙房水库管理局下令开闸放水。这时，启闭塔内的自动化卷扬机启开了重达几万斤的钢铁闸门，每秒三百公尺的强大水流顿时冲出输水隧洞，银浪翻滚地奔往下游。
    这座为根治辽河最大的支流之一——浑河的水患而兴建的巨型水库，是我国自行设计的，坝身长达一千三百七十公尺，可以蓄积二十亿立方公尺的水量。它从1956年拦洪以后，就开始发挥治理水害的威力。近两年来，浑河下游两岸的人民免除了五十年一遇的洪水威胁，今后百年一遇的大洪水也将被驯服地拦蓄在水库里。沈阳附近的浑河灌溉区已经因水库的建成而扩大。水库上一座设备容量三万二千瓩的水力发电站，也正在紧张施工。抚顺农林局养殖场还在平静的人造湖里放养了十多万尾鱼苗。沈阳抚顺两大城市的工业用水，也将因水库的建成而得到满足。
