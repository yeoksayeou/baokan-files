What is concluded through debate must be further developed and amplified in practice. It is not enough to just talk without practice.

The young teachers and students of the Mathematics Department of Peking University, having affirmed the path of mathematics needing to connect with reality through debate, immediately went out of the campus to practice under the leadership of the Party Branch. Under the leadership of the Party, they did not hesitate even when encountering difficulties in practice, and advanced while constantly overcoming them. This truly educated themselves and consolidated the fruits of victory. If they had stopped after the debate, then "if you don't advance, you retreat," and the victory gained through debate would inevitably fade away slowly.

The teachers and students of Peking University went deep into production and construction departments such as cotton spinning, railway transportation, water conservancy projects, and meteorology, taking workers as teachers and the knowledgeable as teachers, learning while doing. In practice, they encountered many problems that were not solved in mathematics textbooks, so they boldly created solutions. In just over twenty days, more than one hundred teachers and students solved more than fifty key problems in production and construction, playing a very good role in the country's production and construction, and opening up a path for the development of mathematics as a discipline.

Their style of adhering to the truth and daring to practice is very good. All intellectuals who support the Party's policies in the debate, or who have changed their understanding after having opposite views, should learn from the style of the young teachers and students of the Mathematics Department of Peking University, do what they say, both speak and practice, and bravely go to practice, not only acknowledging verbally that teaching must be connected with reality, but also proving it with their own actions and achievements.

Some people strongly support the Party's policies in the debate, but when it comes to practice, their old ideas come back. Some emphasize their so-called interests, and some emphasize their so-called habits, always reluctant to part with the old ways. But time waits for no one, and all aspects of the country are making great leaps forward. If you hesitate and stagnate for a day, those who are leaping forward will leave you behind. Some people are afraid of being stumped by workers and peasants after leaving their studies. In fact, being stumped by workers and peasants in practice is a good thing. Because being stumped makes it clearer that your past methods won't work, and promotes your own rapid progress. Learning, learning, to learn is to ask. Asking workers and peasants for advice, asking practice for advice, can lead to faster progress. Now that workers and peasants have already raised many questions, an intellectual who truly wants to develop academically and is determined to contribute his knowledge and strength to socialism should make good use of this condition, bravely go to practice to learn and solve problems. Intellectuals who want to plant red flags must connect with reality, must both speak and practice, and be both civil and military. This is the path to advance towards being both red and expert.

　　要又说又练
　　朱彬
    经过辩论所得到的结论，必须进一步在实践中去发扬光大。光说不练是不行的。
    北京大学数学系青年师生在辩论中肯定了数学必须联系实际的道路，立即就在党总支的领导下走出校门去实践。在党的领导下，在实践中碰到困难也不犹疑，在不断克服困难中前进。这才真正地教育了自己，巩固了胜利的成果。如果他们经过辩论后，就止步不前，那么“不进则退”，辩论所得到的胜利也必然慢慢褪色。
    北京大学的师生深入到棉纺、铁路运输、水利工程以及气象等生产建设部门，拜工人为师，拜知者为师，边做边学。实践中碰到了许多数学书本上没有解决的问题，他们就大胆地创造。仅仅二十多天时间，一百多师生就解决了生产建设上的五十多个关键问题，对国家的生产建设起了很好的作用，从而也为数学这门学科的发展打开了一条道路。
    他们这种坚持真理、勇于实践的风格好得很。所有在辩论中拥护党的方针、或者原来有相反的看法通过辩论后改变了认识的知识分子，都应该学习北大数学系青年师生的风格，说到做到，又说又练，勇敢地去实践，不只口头上承认教学必须联系实际，还用自己的行动和成绩来证明它。
    有些人在辩论中很拥护党的方针，但是一谈到实践，他们就老观点又来了，有的强调自己的所谓兴趣、有的强调自己的所谓习惯，总是和旧的一套难舍难分。可是时间不等人，全国各方面都在大跃进，你犹疑停滞一天，跃进的人就把你抛在后面了。有的人害怕走出书斋后被工人、农民问倒了。其实，在实践中被工人农民问倒，这是件好事。因为问倒才更清楚地知道自己过去的一套不行，才推动自己迅速前进，学问、学问，要学就要问。向工人农民请教，向实际请教，才能更快地前进。现在工人、农民已经把许多问题提出来了，一个真正愿意发展学术，有志于把自己的知识和力量贡献给社会主义的知识分子应该很好的利用这个条件，勇敢地到实际中去学习，去解决问题。知识分子要插红旗就要联系实际，就要又说又练、能文能武。这是向红透专深前进的道路。
