Xinhua News Agency, 3rd September: Reykjavik News - British warships that intruded into Icelandic territorial waters on the 2nd even used armed force to interfere with Icelandic coast guard forces performing their coast guard duties in their own territorial waters, detaining ten Icelandic soldiers. The Icelandic government and people have angrily protested against this barbaric act by Britain.

On the morning of the 2nd, two Icelandic gunboats detained a British fishing vessel, the "Northern Fielder," which had intruded into Icelandic territorial waters to fish. Ten Icelandic coast guard soldiers boarded the fishing vessel. Subsequently, the British warship "Eastbourne" chased after them to support the British fishing vessel. The British navy on the ship barbarically took these Icelandic coast guard soldiers, who were performing coast guard duties, onto the warship and detained them.

After the incident, the Icelandic government immediately lodged a serious protest with the British government.

On the same evening, more than a thousand angry Icelandic people held a demonstration in front of the British Embassy in Reykjavik, protesting against Britain's barbaric and unreasonable behavior. The demonstrators held placards that read: "Down with British Fish Thieves!"

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 3rd: Jakarta newspapers today expressed support for Iceland's decision to extend its territorial sea limit to twelve nautical miles and condemned Britain's actions in violating Icelandic sovereignty.

Jakarta's "People's Daily" said today that the Iceland issue has become a world issue. The newspaper expressed sympathy for the Icelandic people's struggle against British infringement of Icelandic territorial waters and pointed out that the measures taken by Iceland to extend its territorial sea limit, like those already taken by Indonesia, are completely legitimate actions that a sovereign state is entitled to take. The opposition of Britain and the United States to these measures shows that they are unwilling to recognize the sovereignty of other countries and reveals their colonialist nature.

"Independent" published an editorial saying that Britain's action of sending warships to threaten Iceland must be strongly condemned, and the newspaper demanded that Britain stop this "show of force." It also said that Iceland's decision to extend its territorial sea limit is reasonable.

The Indonesian government announced in December 1957 that the breadth of Indonesia's territorial sea to foreign countries was extended to twelve nautical miles, and that the sea between the islands of Indonesia was Indonesian territorial sea. The United States, Britain, and other countries at the time publicly stated that they did not recognize Indonesia's right to do so.

　　冰岛抗议英舰侵入领水横行
    雅加达舆论支持冰岛扩展领海的正当行动
    新华社3日讯　雷克雅未克消息：侵入冰岛领水的英国军舰，2日竟武装干涉冰岛海防部队在自己的领水执行海防任务，扣留了十名冰岛战士。冰岛政府和人民对英国的这种横蛮行为愤怒地提出了抗议。
    2日早晨两艘冰岛炮艇在冰岛领水范围内扣留了一艘侵入冰岛领水捕鱼的英国渔船“北田号”。有十个冰岛海防战士登上这艘渔船。随后，英国军舰“东生号”就追来支援英国渔船。舰上的英国海军蛮横地把这些执行海防任务的冰岛海防战士带到军舰上扣留了起来。
    事件发生以后，冰岛政府立刻向英国政府提出了严重抗议。
    同一天晚上，一千多愤怒的冰岛人民在雷克雅未克英国大使馆门前举行了示威，抗议英国这种横蛮无理的行为。示威群众举着的标语牌上写着：“打倒英国偷鱼者！”
    据新华社雅加达3日电　雅加达报纸今天表示支持冰岛把它的领海范围扩展为十二浬的决定，并且谴责英国侵犯冰岛主权的行动。
    雅加达“人民日报”今天说，冰岛的问题已经成为一个世界性的问题。报纸表示同情冰岛人民反对英国侵犯冰岛领海的斗争，并且指出，冰岛所采取的扩展它的领海范围的措施，同印度尼西亚已经采取的一样，是一个主权国家有权采取的完全合法的行动。英美反对这种措施，表明他们不愿意承认其他国家的主权，显露了它们的殖民主义者的本性。
    “独立报”发表社论说，英国派出军舰去威胁冰岛的行动必须遭到强烈的谴责，报纸要求英国停止这种“显示实力”的行动。它还说，冰岛扩展它的领海范围的决定是合理的。
    印度尼西亚政府曾在1957年12月宣布，印度尼西亚同外国之间的领海宽度扩展为十二浬，同时，印度尼西亚各岛之间的海面都是印度尼西亚领海。美英等国当时曾经公然表示不承认印度尼西亚有这种权利。
