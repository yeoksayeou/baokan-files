A Record of Iron Smelting in Fengcheng
By our reporter Ye Jianyun

　　In early June, the Nanchang Prefecture of Jiangxi Province held a meeting where it was proposed that all counties under the prefecture should vigorously develop iron and steel. The Prefectural Party Secretary said at the meeting: Regardless of the county, some need not be mentioned, and those that don't have it must also do it. Each county must produce at least five thousand tons of iron!

　　The representatives from Fengcheng County shook their heads straight away upon hearing the task of five thousand tons. After hesitating for a while, they gritted their teeth and accepted the task of one thousand five hundred tons.

　　As soon as the meeting ended, they rushed back to the county. Reporting this figure to the County Party Secretary, the comrades of the County Party Committee also felt very difficult. What to do? First Secretary Lu Ming said:

　　"There is only one way: follow the mass line."

　　The next day, in the sweltering heat, the county magistrate and department heads took the lead, mobilizing more than 360 people from the county to search for minerals in the mountains. These people had only ever handled sickles and hoes. Let alone finding ore, even if a large pile of ore was placed in front of them, they wouldn't be able to make head or tail of it.

　　After searching for several days without results, someone from Xinyu came, bringing a few pieces of iron ore. At first, people treated it like a treasure, looking at it admiringly. Some said: "The people of Xinyu are truly blessed. This treasure, one family occupies tens of billions of tons, while the people of Fengcheng have searched for several days and haven't found a single piece as big as an ebony seed."

　　At this moment, a farmer suddenly burst in. He picked up a piece of ore and stuffed it into his chest. Everyone laughed at him for being a mineral enthusiast, "Can't find it, so he's picking up someone else's to quench his thirst!" But he left without saying a word. A day later, this farmer came to town again. As soon as he arrived, he took out two pieces of ore from his chest. He gestured, asking others to say whether these two pieces of ore were the same. Others, not understanding the details, casually replied:

　　"If they come from the same mountain, how could they be different?"

　　"One mountain? Hundreds of miles apart, how big is this mountain?" Then he explained that this ore came from Fengcheng County. In the past, there were no samples, no comparisons, so even if they saw it, they wouldn't recognize it.

　　The news spread quickly. Various townships brought samples for comparison, and more than a dozen locations were discovered at once. According to the estimate of geological personnel afterwards, the reserves of iron ore in Fengcheng are more than 300 million tons, with grades ranging from 39% to 60%. At this time, the Commissioner's Office increased their task, multiplying it by ten at once, requiring them to produce 15,000 tons of iron this year.

　　Fengcheng had never smelted iron before, and the entire county couldn't find a single iron smelting furnace to use as a model. To smelt iron, what tools to use?

　　There was a very small workshop in Fengcheng that cast iron rice pots, which had recently been converted into a farm tool factory. There was no iron smelting furnace here, but there was a cauldron for melting iron. Melting iron and smelting iron were originally two different things, but because they had no experience, they used it to smelt iron.

　　County Magistrate Wu Jinfa and County Party Committee Industry and Transportation Minister Zhang Changshun carried two loads of ore, swaying as they walked. As soon as they arrived, they poured the ore and charcoal into the furnace. They lit the fire and vigorously pulled the bellows to send air. After burning for more than an hour, they found that bright iron water was flowing in the furnace. Then, they opened the furnace to tap the iron.

　　Unexpectedly, what poured out was a pile of lumpy black lumps. People thought this was iron, and couldn't wait for it to cool down before wanting to reach out and touch it. However, the workers in the workshop had some experience. He spread out his hands to stop everyone, saying that this thing was too hot to touch. He shook his head and walked to County Magistrate Wu, saying: "I've been dealing with iron for half my life, but I've never seen iron like this."

　　The first iron smelting failed. People didn't say a word, burying their heads to prepare the second furnace. Minister Zhang was more meticulous. He thought: "Failure is not to be feared, we must find out the reason for the failure!" At this time, someone found an old metallurgy newspaper, which said that limestone should be added to iron smelting. So they went to find a boundary stone (the kind people use as Taishan stones), broke it into pieces, and put it into the furnace. This time, they burned it for a longer time. As a result, what poured out was still a lumpy, unidentifiable black mass. The color was slightly lighter than before. A worker, feeling impatient, used a blacksmith's hammer to break it. Another worker brought a magnet, placed it on the ground, and many fragments on the ground adhered to the magnet. After taking it down and weighing it, it weighed more than a pound. This made everyone overjoyed. They said: "Although we didn't smelt iron water after working for several days, we saw iron filings."

　　The news spread like a bird with wings, all over the entire prefecture, saying that Fengcheng had already seen iron. People came in an endless stream to visit and learn the skills. At this time, the Commissioner's Office called, saying that Fengcheng County's task was not 15,000 tons, but should produce 30,000 tons of iron. They were very afraid, fearing that the iron hadn't been smelted yet, and the task was already being increased layer by layer. However, everyone had a conclusion in their hearts: With iron ore, iron must be smelted. Not being able to smelt it is only a temporary phenomenon.

　　A national iron smelting upsurge swept the country. The people sent by the Fengcheng County Party Committee to learn in Pingxiang, Yongxin, Xinfeng and other places also rushed back. Industry Minister Zhang Changshun, who was studying in Xinfeng, immediately made a long-distance call home as soon as he saw the style of the furnace, saying that the reason for our failure was mainly that the furnace body was too low, the furnace belly was too small, and the furnace temperature was not high enough…; however, he forgot to mention the complete operating procedures. The family received Minister Zhang's call and turned the furnace upside down overnight, smelting two furnaces, and failed again.

　　After eight failures, several workers couldn't hold back. They said: "Nothing is difficult in the world, except for smelting iron!" Chen Youyuan, the branch secretary of the iron smelting test team, interjected: "The people of Xinfeng can flow iron water, could it be that the people of Fengcheng are half a head shorter than them? Saying it's difficult makes it difficult, as long as we are not stumped by it, I don't believe we can't flow iron water."

　　In the middle of the night, the workers were tired all day and lay down to sleep, but no one could sleep. Everyone got up and worked for a while, preparing ingredients, ramming the furnace… The branch secretary walked over and gently said to everyone: "You're tired, go back and lie down for a while, so you can continue to work!"

　　This day was July 31st. As soon as the sun came out, County Magistrate Wu and Minister Zhang brought ore again. They looked, and the factory was quiet. "What? Discouraged?" They couldn't help but wonder when they saw that there was no one by the furnace. Walking up to touch it, the furnace was scorching hot.

　　"Ah! These guys, worked all night, and failed again!" Saying that, the two began to crush ore, select ore, and sinter it, then prepare the ingredients. At this time, Zhang Changshun said to County Magistrate Wu: "In the past, we suffered because we didn't know the three links of crushing, selecting, and sintering. The principle is very simple, the furnace is like a person's stomach, eating everything haphazardly, of course, digestion will be bad." County Magistrate Wu smiled at him. At this time, all the workers rushed over, some lit the fire, and others fed the materials. Strangely, this furnace burned particularly smoothly today. At ten o'clock, iron water flowed out for the first time. After that, it flowed once every fifty minutes. More than four hundred catties of iron were produced this day. When the iron came out, the entire Fengcheng was in an uproar. Farmers from the four townships rushed into the city to learn and visit, so they could build iron smelting furnaces back home. Next to the small furnace, iron ingots were laid out on the ground. At this time, I don't know who came up with the idea, borrowed wool brushes from the neighboring elementary school, dipped them in ink, and wrote the four characters "Fengcheng's Iron" in a bold and unrestrained manner on red paper and pasted them on the iron ingots.

　　The next day, the workers carried Fengcheng's iron by train to Nanchang to report the good news to the Prefectural and Provincial Party Committees. Industry Minister Zhang Changshun, on behalf of the County Party Committee, proposed a new target to the Prefectural Party Committee: guarantee the production of 100,000 tons of iron before the end of the year.

　　丰城炼铁记
　　本报记者　叶剑韵
      6月上旬，江西省南昌专区开了一个会，会上提出专区所属各县要大搞钢铁。地委书记在会上说：不问那一个县，有的不必说，没有的也得搞，每个县至少要搞出五千吨铁来！
    丰城县的开会代表，一听说五千吨的任务就直摇头，犹豫了一番，咬了咬牙，才接受了一千五百吨的任务。
    会议一结束，他们就赶回县里去了。把这个数字向县委书记一汇报，县委的同志也感到很为难。怎么办呢？第一书记陆明说：
    “办法只有一条：走群众路线。”
    第二天，大暑热天，县长、部长带头，全县发动了三百六十多人上山找矿。这些人，过去只搬过镰刀锄头，别说矿石还要找，即是一大堆矿石摆在他们面前，也说不出个什么道理来。
    找了几天没结果。这时有人从新余来，捎来了几块铁矿石。起初人们把它当宝贝，用羡慕的眼光瞧了又瞧。有的说：“新余人真有福气，这宗宝贝，一家就占了几十亿吨，丰城人找了几天，乌桕子籽大的一块也没找上。”
    这时，外面突然闯进来了一个农民，他捡了一块矿石就往怀里揣，在场的人都笑他是矿石迷，“找不着，拣人家一块杀杀渴哩！”可他一声没响就走了。隔了一天，这个农民又进城来了，一来就从怀里掏出了两块矿石，他比划着，要别人说说这两块矿石是不是一个样。别人不了解底细，就随随便便回他说：
    “出在一个山上，还会有什么两样的。”
    “一座山？相隔几百里，这座山派多大”。接着他说明了这块矿石出在丰城县，过去没样板，没比较，见着了也不识。
    消息迅速传开了。各乡带上样板去对比，一下就发现了十多处，据事后地质人员的估计，丰城铁矿石的藏量在三亿吨以上，品位从39％一直到60％。这时，专署就在他们的任务上加了码，一下就是十翻，要他们在今年内生产出一万五千吨铁来。
    丰城一向没炼过铁，全县也找不到一只炼铁的炉子作样子。要炼铁，使什么家伙哩？
    丰城街上有个规模很小的铸造饭锅子的作坊，不久前，已改成农具厂了。这里没有炼铁炉，却有一只化铁的甑子。化铁炼铁本来是两码事，由于他们没经验，就用它炼起铁来了。
    县长吴金发、县委工业交通部长章长顺晃起晃起的挑来了两担矿石。一来，把矿石木炭呼噜噜倒了满满一炉子。点着火一个劲的拉风箱送风。烧了一个多钟头，发现炉子里白闪闪的铁水在流动，接着，就开炉出铁。
    不料，倒出来的是一堆团团块块的黑蛋蛋。人们以为这就是铁，等不及冷却，就有人想伸手去摸它。还是作坊里的工人有些经验，他张开两手阻止大家说，这玩艺儿烫手摸不得，一面直摇头，走到吴县长面前说：“我和铁打了半辈子的交道，可就是没瞧过这种样子的铁。”
    第一次炼铁失败了。人们一句话没说，埋着头装第二炉。章部长这人心比较细，他想：“失败不怕，总得找出失败的原因来啊！”这时有人找来了一份旧冶金报，报上说，炼铁要放石灰石。于是就去找了一块分界石（就是人家用作泰山石敢当的那种石头），把它敲碎了，放进炉子里去。这次烧的时间长一些。结果，倒出来的，仍然是一块块四不像的黑团团。颜色可比过去浅一些。有个工人闷的不耐烦，就用一把打铁的鎯头把它敲碎。另一个工人拿来了一只吸铁石，往地上一放，地上的许多碎屑子都附在吸铁石上了。取下来一称，有一斤多点。这下可把大家乐坏了，他们说：“我们搞了几天，虽然没有炼出铁水，可见到铁屑子了。”
    消息像长了翅膀的小鸟，一下就传遍了全专区，说丰城已经见到铁了。来参观学本领的人络绎不绝。这时，专署打来了电话，说丰城县的任务不是一万五千吨，而是应该出三万吨铁。他们心里很害怕，怕的是铁还没有炼出来，任务就在层层加码。然而每个人心里都装了一条结论：有了铁矿总是要炼铁的，炼不出来，不过是暂时的现象而已。
    一个全民炼铁的热潮在全国掀起来了。丰城县委派往萍乡、永新、信丰等地学习的人也纷纷赶回来了。在信丰学习的工业部长章长顺，一看到人家炉子的样式，就急如星火地打了个长途电话给家里，说是我们所以失败，主要是炉身太低，炉腹太小，炉温不够……；可是，他把人家的全套操作程序忘记讲了。家里接到了章部长的电话，连夜就把炉子翻了个个，炼了两炉，又失败了。
    经过八次失败以后，有几个工人可沉不住气了。他们说：“天下无难事，就是炼铁难！”炼铁试验组的支部书记陈友源在一旁插上去说：“信丰人能流铁水，难不成丰城人比他矮了半截，说难就难，只要我们不被它难倒，不信就流不出铁水来。”
    半夜，工人们累了一天，都躺下睡觉了，可是谁都睡不着。大家爬起来，又干了一阵，配料的配料，捣炉的捣炉……支部书记走过去轻轻地对大家说：“累了，回去躺一躺，好接着再干！”
    这一天是7月31号，太阳刚出来，吴县长、章部长他们又挑了矿砂来了。一瞧，厂里静悄悄的。“怎嘛？泄气了吗？”当他们看到炉旁一个人也没有的时候，不觉奇怪起来。走上去一摸，炉子是滚烫。
      “咳！这家伙，干了个通宵，又干了个不成功！”说着，两个人就动手碎矿、选矿、烧结，然后配料。这时章长顺对吴县长说：“过去我们吃亏就吃在不知道碎、选、烧这三个环节上。道理很简单，炉子也像人的肚子一样，乱七八糟地瞎吃一起，当然消化不良了。”吴县长向他笑了笑。这时工人们全赶来了，你点火，他下料。说也怪，今天这一炉烧的特别顺，到十点钟，第一次流出了铁水。此后每隔五十分钟流一次，这一天就出了四百多斤铁。出铁了，全丰城都哄动起来了。四乡里的农民赶进城来学习参观，好回去办炼铁炉。小炉子旁边，一块一块的铁饼子摊在地上。这时不知是谁想出来的这个点子，在隔壁小学里借来了羊毛笔，蘸满了墨，龙飞凤舞地在红纸上写了“丰城的铁”四个大字贴在铁饼子上。
    第二天，工人们抬了丰城的铁坐上火车到南昌去向地委省委报喜。工业部章长顺代表县委向地委提出了新的指标：保证年底前生产十万吨铁。
