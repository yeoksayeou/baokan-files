　　Active Rural Sports in Shaanxi

　　(Our report) Over the past few months, rural sports in Shaanxi Province have experienced vigorous development amidst the overall Great Leap Forward. In Yan'an, Dali, and Lantian counties alone, all townships and communes have established sports associations, with the number of regular participants increasing sevenfold compared to last year. In Yulin, Yan'an, Xianyang, Lantian, and Dali, nine thousand people have passed the Labor and Defense System standards in half a year. In Xinzhuang and Zhangjiazhuang townships in Dali, 65% of young and middle-aged people have passed the first level of the Labor and Defense System. In Xiazhai township, more than a dozen third-level track and field athletes have emerged.

　　In these activities, the broad masses have played an active role in solving many difficulties. The masses in Yaodian township, Yan'an County, used three days of voluntary labor to build twenty sports grounds and made more than sixty kinds of sports equipment. Wangmang township in Chang'an County used natural conditions to build two swimming pools. Hua County has also established two amateur sports colleges.

　　The development of rural sports has enhanced health, enlivened life, and greatly changed the mental outlook of the farmers. More than one hundred young men and women in Huaxu township, Lantian County, persisted in hard training while participating in canal construction, never absent from work, and remained energetic throughout. After the development of sports activities in Dali County, the phenomenon of gambling and fighting among young people has been eliminated.

　　陕西农村体育运动活跃
    本报讯　几个月来陕西农村体育运动在全面跃进中获得了蓬勃发展。仅延安、大荔、蓝田三个县的各乡社已全部建立了体协，经常参加活动人数比去年增加七倍。榆林、延安、咸阳、蓝田、大荔半年中有九千人通过了劳卫制。大荔新庄和张家庄乡在青壮年中，已有65％通过劳卫一级。下寨乡还出现了十几名三级田径运动员。
    在活动中，广大群众发挥了积极作用解决了不少困难。延安县姚店乡群众用三天义务劳动修建了二十个运动场，制做了六十多种运动器材设备。长安县王莽乡利用自然条件修了两个游泳池。华县还建立了两所业余体育学院。
    农村体育的开展，增强了健康，活跃了生活，大大改变着农民精神面貌。蓝田县花胥乡一百多男女青年在参加修渠工程中，坚持刻苦锻炼，干活不缺勤，精力始终充沛。大荔县体育活动开展后，在青年中消灭了过去耍钱打架现象。
