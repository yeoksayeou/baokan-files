    Chairman Mao's words reach the workshop

    Chairman Mao's words reach the workshop,
    Laughter in the workshop bursts through the sky;
    The American imperialists tie a noose around their own necks,
    Let's all pull together,
    Pull! Pull!
    Strength greater than the sky.
    We won't use our hands,
    Quickly replace them with motors,
    And automation will be achieved.
    American robbers will die quickly,
    The people of the world will laugh heartily.
    (State-run Broadcasting Equipment Factory
          Worker Li Junde)

    Quickly Forge Three Bridges
    Flames of anger burn in the furnace,
    Burning the furnace temperature high and strong,
    Smelt more iron to produce steel quickly.
    Quickly forge three bridges:
    One bridge to Jinmen Island,
    One bridge to Mazu Island,
    One bridge to Taiwan,
    To liberate our compatriots.
  (Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 Zheng Songnian)

    Treat the Construction Site as a Battlefield
    Treat the construction site as a battlefield,
    Treat the hammer as a machine gun,
    Stones as American wolves,
    Mud as the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang,
    Aim at their heads and smash,
    So they can be crushed to meet the King of Hell.
(Worker from a construction site Huang Hong)

    加紧生产打击敌人
    毛主席的话传到车间
    毛主席的话传到车间，
    车间笑声冲破天；
    美帝自缚绞索套，
    咱们一齐用力拉，
    拉呀！拉呀！
    力量比天大。
    咱们不用手，
    赶快换马达，
    就成自动化。
    美国强盗死的快，
    世界人民笑哈哈。
    （国营广播器材厂
          工人　李浚德）
    快快炼出三座桥
    愤怒火焰烧炉膛，
    烧得炉温高又旺，
    多炼铁来快出钢。
    快快炼出三座桥：
    一座架到金门岛，
    一座架到马祖岛，
    一座架向台湾去，
    要把同胞来解放。
  （上钢一厂　郑松年）
    要把工地当战场
    要把工地当战场，
    要把铁锤当机枪，
    石子当做美国狼，
    泥巴便是蒋匪帮，
    对准它们的脑壳砸，
    叫它们粉身见阎王。（某工地工人　荒洪）
