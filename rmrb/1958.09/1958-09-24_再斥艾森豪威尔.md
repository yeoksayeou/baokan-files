The war maniac's face turned red, losing all composure in his fury.
A book criticizing the Soviet Union, scared Ike into bulging eyes.
He hurriedly returned the original letter after reading it, proving Ike's heart trembled in fear.
If you weren't scared out of your wits, you could have taken it calmly.
Scaring people neither scares them nor fools them, deceiving only yourself.
Atomic blackmail, who are you blackmailing? The "brink of war" tactic is finished!
Although you have atomic bombs, you no longer have a monopoly.
We have already declared: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!
We will not attack unless attacked; if we are attacked, we will retaliate.
If you throw one at us, we will return a thousand.
Who is "subverting," who is "expanding," constantly invading other people's territory?
Cover up with a million layers of painted skin, and everyone can see through it!
Who, in the Western Pacific, is forming a "new moon blockade":
Korea, Japan, the Ryukyu Islands, from our Taiwan to Vietnam?
Who is deploying planes and warships five thousand miles from their homeland?
To whom does Taiwan and Penghu belong? How does it concern your America?
Your military force is also limited; the battle line is stretched without end.
The Far East, the Middle East, and the Near East, a long string across Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
Each noose tightens around your neck, willingly put on to be led by others.
Aircraft carriers and warships, willingly serve as targets for rockets.
Of course, you also have lackeys, Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee,
Nobusuke Kishi and Malik, birds of a feather, not worth mentioning!
You dominate the United Nations, posing as heroes in front of the door.
Without China on the council, you can spew nonsense endlessly.
You know you are unprecedentedly isolated, using voting machines only with money.
Your allies fear getting into trouble, and even accomplices are hard to find as partners.
Manipulating voting machines is already difficult, and it's just a fig leaf!
Some clear-sighted people in America are telling you not to take reckless risks.
Let's talk frankly: we have already seized the initiative.
We are not afraid of you in the slightest, while you are scared out of your wits.
Forrestal jumped out of a building long ago; Ike jumping out wouldn't be far off.
If you still know shame with a red face and bulging eyes, turning back is the right path.
Withdraw all troops from Taiwan, and the new moon battle line will become a waning moon.
Quickly untie the noose around your neck, and you can sleep soundly at night.
If you are willing to be hanged, it is because your wickedness is overflowing.
Surpassing Himmler and Tojo, your war crimes are truly unprecedented.
Human history will leave criticism, and your infamous name will remain for ten thousand years.
Write a book about Ike and Dulles, the criminals of atomic war!
I ask you, where are you going, what are you doing? Hanging or living, it's your choice.
Negotiations are currently underway in Warsaw; you still have time to choose.
Peaceful coexistence is the principle, and peaceful competition is the norm.
The superiority of socialism has opened a new era in history.
Who can reverse the great wheel of history? America must also undergo a great transformation.
Where are Greece and Rome now? Caesar and Napoleon are long gone!
You have blockaded us for eight or nine years, and China continues to develop greatly.
Ignoring reason and facts, you are blind in your heart and in your eyes.
The people hold the winning ticket, and the forces of peace are vast and boundless.
If you dare to throw eggs against rocks, you will eliminate war forever.

    再斥艾森豪威尔
    郭沫若战争狂人红了脸，恼羞成怒失检点。一书谴责自苏联，骇得艾克瞪白眼。原信阅罢忙打还，证明艾克心胆战。你如没有骇破胆，尽可处之以泰然。骇人人既骇不倒，骗人只把自己骗。原子讹诈讹诈谁？“战争边缘”手法完！尽管你有原子弹，如今已非你垄断。我们已经早声明：要以牙眼还牙眼！人不犯我我不犯，人若犯我我必还。你如投我以一个，我要还你以一千。是谁“颠倒”谁“扩张”对人领土常侵犯？画皮蒙上一万层，谁都可以看得穿！是谁西部太平洋，构成“新月封锁线”：朝鲜、日本、琉球岛、从我台湾到越南？是谁离国五千哩，调集飞机和军舰？台湾澎湖究谁属，如何归你美国管？你的武力也有限，战线拖得没边缘。远东中东和近东，亚非南美一大串。条条绞索套颈间，自行套上让人牵。航空母舰和军舰，甘作靶子受火箭。自然你也有鹰犬，蒋介石和李承晚，岸信介和马利克，一丘之貉何足算！联合国由你霸占，门前自充英雄汉。没有中国在议席，你自鬼话可连篇。空前孤立你自知，投票机器只要钱。你的同盟怕惹祸，帮凶也难充伙伴。票机操纵已困难，况是遮羞布一片！美国也有明眼人，叫你不要冒大险。老实向你扯开谈：我们已操主动权。我们丝毫不怕你，而你怕得魂魄散。福莱斯特早跳楼，艾克跳楼谅不远。脸红眼白尚知羞，如肯回头就是岸。全军撤退自台湾，新月战线成下弦。颈上绞索快自解，晚上睡觉也舒坦。如果甘愿受绞刑，是你艾克恶贯满。超过希莫和东条，战争罪恶实空前。人类历史留批判，臭名将遗万万年；大书艾克杜勒斯原子战争之罪犯！问你何去复何从，是绞是活由你选。华沙目前在谈判，选择你还有时间。和平共处是准则，和平竞赛是规范。社会主义优越性，历史已辟新纪元。谁能逆转大车轮？美国也要大转变。希腊罗马今何在？凯撤拿翁已如烟！你已封锁八九年，中国依然大发展。不讲道理背事实，瞎了心眼和肉眼。人民群众操左券，和平力量大无边。以卵投石你如敢，消灭战争于永远。
