Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 13th: Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 1 Blast Furnace produced its first batch of molten iron at 3:25 PM on September 13th. The leap forward plan, originally scheduled to produce iron on October 1st, was realized eighteen days ahead of schedule.

At 3:25 PM on September 13th, the furnace workers, led by the famous advanced producer Bao Xiuliang, used the latest electric opening machine and oxygen flame to open the taphole, and the first furnace of molten iron, glowing with fire, rushed out of the furnace. Fourteen months and twelve days of hard work had blossomed and borne fruit! More than 3,000 people at the scene immediately burst into stormy applause and cheers. Then, the molten iron was cast into iron blocks by machine, picked up by the electric magnet of a crane, and sent to the warehouse. Furnace worker Bao Xiuliang pressed the button in the distance, and the latest electric mud gun immediately sealed the taphole with refractory clay.

Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 1 Blast Furnace is a world-class blast furnace designed with the help of the Soviet Union. It can produce more than 2,000 tons of pig iron per day, and can reach more than 2,500 tons after the sintering workshop is put into production. The British Wales Company's No. 4 Blast Furnace, once referred to as "the largest blast furnace in Western Europe" by several British metallurgical magazines, has a daily output of only more than 1,500 tons. The average daily output of the largest blast furnaces in the United States does not exceed 2,000 tons at most. After the production adjustment of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 1 Blast Furnace is normal, its production capacity will surpass Britain and the United States and stand at the forefront of world blast furnaces.

This blast furnace started loading materials at 8:05 AM on the 12th. At 3:20 AM on the morning of the 13th, Li Yiqing, Secretary of the General Party Committee and General Manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, pressed the button controlling the hot air network, and hot air at 750 degrees Celsius automatically blew into the furnace, igniting the wood piled in the hearth. A thin tube inserted into the taphole spurted a ten-foot-high flame, and the blast furnace went into production.

The construction of this blast furnace started on July 1st last year. The date it was put into production was brought forward from the initially planned July 1st, 1959, to the end of this year. At the beginning of this year, inspired by the general line of socialist construction, thousands of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation blast furnace builders voluntarily proposed the slogan of "Producing Iron Ahead of Schedule to Catch Up with Britain," guaranteeing that the blast furnace would produce iron ahead of schedule on October 1st. Their leap forward plan immediately received the support of the people of the whole country and the assistance of the Soviet Union. Hundreds of mechanical and electrical manufacturing factories at home and abroad rushed to manufacture the equipment needed for the blast furnace in advance. The builders of the blast furnace also worked hard day and night on the construction site, regardless of wind and rain, winter cold and snow, and the scorching sun. Many workers often stayed at their posts for several days and nights in a row in order to complete a project. They boldly innovated construction methods, enabling many projects to be completed ahead of schedule. Recently, leading cadres at all levels, headed by General Manager Li Yiqing, and the iron smelting and mechanical and electrical installation workers, have been working continuously for more than ten days and nights, sleeping only two or three hours a day, using the action of striving to produce iron ahead of schedule at No. 1 Blast Furnace to support the Party Central Committee's decision to double steel production and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan. Soviet experts, headed by Chief Advisor Badurov, also insisted on staying on the construction site day and night to help workers check and adjust various equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 13th: In the process of building Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 1 Blast Furnace, it received assistance from nearly a hundred Soviet experts, who made great contributions to ensuring that Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 1 Blast Furnace produced iron ahead of schedule.

It was the first time for our country to build such a huge world-class blast furnace as Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, and the difficulties encountered were particularly numerous. The former leader of the expert group, Savitsky, personally participated in compiling the minimum process system of No. 1 Blast Furnace, specifically checked the engineering projects and equipment lists necessary for the blast furnace production, and prevented difficulties caused by omissions. The current leader of the expert group, Badurov, just arrived at Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, he firmly grasped the key to producing iron ahead of schedule - the equipment supply issue, organized forces to urge goods in various places, and he himself traveled back and forth between Wuhan, Beijing, and Moscow several times, so that the equipment necessary for the blast furnace production arrived at the construction site in advance. When pouring the concrete foundation of the blast furnace, it was the hottest July in Wuhan, and the concrete engineering expert Konstantinov postponed his vacation in order to ensure that all the concrete was poured in thirty hours, and personally participated in the pouring work. He was not afraid of the heat and went down to the foundation pit to check the quality of the concrete, and went to the construction site late at night to solve technical problems, so that the blast furnace foundation was poured in twenty-seven hours, and the quality reached excellent. When the furnace body was installed, the Soviet integral installation method brought by the Soviet expert Okun greatly accelerated the speed of the project installation. He also personally helped the construction site train forty senior welders to ensure that the welding quality of the project reached excellent. Refractory material expert Felezhekov only recently arrived at the construction site. As soon as he arrived at the construction site, he drilled into the pipeline and laid bricks with the workers, which greatly moved the workers.

While sending experts to help our country with construction, many Soviet mechanical and electrical manufacturing factories also manufactured a large number of special equipment for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 1 Blast Furnace. In order to ensure that No. 1 Blast Furnace produced iron ahead of schedule, these equipments were manufactured four to six months in advance.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 13th: More than two hundred mechanical and electrical manufacturing factories in eighteen provinces and cities across the country cooperated on a large scale, rushing to manufacture equipment urgently needed by Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, creating extremely favorable conditions for No. 1 Blast Furnace to be put into production ahead of schedule.

The equipment manufactured domestically for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 1 Blast Furnace system totals more than 34,000 tons, many of which our country had not produced in the past. At the beginning of this year, when Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation proposed to produce iron at No. 1 Blast Furnace ahead of schedule on October 1st, there were still more than 6,000 tons of equipment that were difficult to supply ahead of schedule. In order to solve this problem, the responsible cadres of the provincial and municipal party committees and industrial departments who were responsible for the manufacturing tasks personally convened meetings and rearranged the production plans of various factories according to the needs of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation to ensure that this key national project was put into production ahead of schedule. In Liaoning Province, which undertook the most mechanical equipment for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, the responsible comrades of the provincial party committee personally went to Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory to check the manufacturing of the furnace top loading equipment of No. 1 Blast Furnace, and instructed the Industry Department to convene a meeting of the industrial bureau chiefs of various cities under its jurisdiction and the factory directors of relevant factories, and listed the manufacturing of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation equipment as the first priority of production. In Shanghai, which undertook the most electrical equipment for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, the General Office of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Planning Commission designated special personnel to be specifically responsible for handling Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's affairs.

From March and April of this year, many factories across the country launched a surge of production cooperation to support Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation. Harbin organized more than 30 factories to make belt conveyors for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation blast furnace. Shanghai Cable Factory took on the production task of 30 kilometers of cable for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, and immediately organized the power company to complete it on schedule. The factory director of Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory, in order to manufacture the cast iron machine for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, specifically went to the workshop to work shifts. Shanghai Xin'an Electric Motor Factory also specifically tied red cloth strips on the workpieces ordered by Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, and the workers immediately made them in advance when they saw the red cloth strips. In order to ensure the timely transportation of these equipments, the staff of the railway and shipping departments in various places also cooperated closely.

    日产二千吨的世界第一流高炉飞速赶上钢铁前线
    武钢一号高炉提前为祖国效劳
    近百位苏联专家热情帮助　十八省市二百多工厂倾力支援
    据新华社武汉13日电　武汉钢铁公司一号高炉13日下午三点二十五分钟炼出第一次铁水。原订10月1日出铁的跃进计划，又提前十八天实现。
    13日下午三点二十五分，以著名先进生产者包秀良为首的炉前工用最新式的电动开口机和氧气火焰通开出铁口后，第一炉冒着火光的铁水便从炉内冲了出来。十四个月零十二天的辛勤建设开花结果了！全场三千多人顿时响起一阵暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼。接着，铁水被机器铸成铁块，由吊车的电磁盘吸住送入仓库。炉前工包秀良在远处按动电钮，最新式的电动泥炮马上用耐火泥将出铁口堵上。
    武钢一号高炉是苏联帮助我国设计的世界第一流的高炉。它一天可出生铁两千吨以上，等烧结车间投入生产后，还可以达到二千五百吨以上。曾被英国几种冶金杂志称为“西欧最大的高炉”的英国威尔思公司四号高炉，日产量仅为一千五百多吨。美国最大高炉的平均日产量，最高也不多于两千吨。当武钢一号高炉的生产调整正常后，它的生产能力就超过英美，站在世界高炉的前列。
    这座高炉从12日上午八点五分开始装料，13日早晨三点二十分，武钢总党委书记兼总经理李一清，将控制热风网的电钮一按，摄氏七百五十度的热风便自动吹进炉内，将炉缸里堆放的木料点燃，插入出铁口的细管喷出了一丈高的烈火，这座高炉便投入生产了。
    这座高炉是从去年7月1日动工兴建的。它投入生产的日期，曾由最初计划的1959年7月1日提前到今年年底。今年年初，为社会主义建设总路线所鼓舞的几千名武钢高炉建设者，又自动提出“提前出铁赶英国”的口号，保证将这座高炉提前在10月1日出铁。他们的跃进计划立即得到全国人民的支持和苏联的援助，国内外几百个机电制造工厂都将高炉所需要的设备提前赶制出来。高炉的建设者们也不避风雨，不避冬寒冰雪和盛暑烈日，日夜坚持在工地苦战。许多工人经常为了赶完一件工程，连续几天几夜不离岗位。他们大胆革新施工方法，使许多项工程提前完成。最近以总经理李一清为首的各级领导干部和炼铁、机电安装职工，更是每天只睡两三小时，连续苦战了十多个昼夜，用争取一号高炉再提前出铁的行动来拥护党中央将钢产量翻一番的决定，并支援解放台湾的斗争。以总顾问巴杜洛夫为首的苏联专家们，也是日夜坚持在工地上帮助工人们检查和调整各项设备。
    新华社武汉13日电　在建设武钢一号高炉的过程中，曾经得到近百名苏联专家的帮助，他们对保证武钢一号高炉提前出铁作出了很大贡献。
    建设武钢这样巨大的世界第一流的高炉，我国还是第一次，遇到的困难特别多。前任专家组长萨维斯基，亲自参与编制一号高炉最低限度的工艺系统，具体检查这座高炉生产必需的工程项目和设备清单，防止因为漏项而造成困难，现任的专家组长巴杜洛夫刚到武钢，就紧紧抓住提前出铁的关键——设备供应问题，组织力量到各地催货，他自己也几度往返在武汉、北京、莫斯科之间，使高炉生产必需的设备都提前到达工地。浇灌高炉基础混凝土时，正遇上武汉最热的7月，混凝土工程专家康斯坦诺夫为了保证在三十个小时内浇完全部混凝土，推迟了自己的休假期，亲自参加浇灌工作。他不畏炎热下到基坑里检查混凝土质量，深夜里还到工地解决技术问题，使高炉基础在二十七小时内就浇灌完毕，质量达到优等。高炉安装炉体时，由苏联专家奥坤带来的苏联的整体安装法，大大地加速了工程安装的速度。他还亲自帮助工地培训了四十名高级电焊工，保证了工程焊接质量达到优等。耐火材料专家费列日可夫最近才到工地，他一到工地就钻进管道中去，同工人一起砌砖，使工人们非常感动。
    在派出专家帮助我国建设的同时，苏联许多机电制造工厂还为武钢一号高炉制造了大批特种设备。为了保证一号高炉提前出铁，这些设备都是提前四个月到半年赶制出来的。
    新华社武汉13日电　全国十八个省市二百多个机电制造工厂大协作，及时赶制武钢急用的设备，为一号高炉提前投入生产创造了极为有利的条件。
    武钢一号高炉系统在国内制造的设备共达三万四千多吨，其中有许多是我国过去没有生产过的。今年年初，武钢提出将一号高炉提前在10月1日出铁时，还有六千多吨设备很难提前供应。为了解决这一问题，担负承制任务的各省、市委书记和工业部门的负责干部都亲自召集会议，按照武钢的需要重新安排各厂的生产计划，以确保国家这个重点工程提前投入生产。在承制武钢机械设备最多的辽宁省，省委负责同志曾亲自到沈阳重型机器厂检查一号高炉炉顶装料设备的制造情况，并且指示工业厅召集所属各市的工业局长和有关厂厂长开会，把制造武钢设备列为生产第一位。承制武钢电气设备最多的上海市，中共市委办公厅和市计委，都指定了专人具体负责处理武钢的事务。
    从今年3、4月起，全国各地许多工厂就掀起了支援武钢的生产协作的热潮。哈尔滨组织了三十多个工厂为武钢高炉制作皮带运输机。上海电缆厂接下了武钢三十公里电缆的生产任务，就马上组织电力公司共同按期完成。大连工矿车辆厂的厂长，为了制造武钢的铸铁机，专门下到工段去值班。上海新安电机厂还专门在武钢订制的工作物上扎上红布条，工人一见红布条就马上提前制作。为了保证及时运送这些设备，各地铁路、海运部门职工也都进行了密切配合。
