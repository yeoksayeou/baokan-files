Anshan, September 11th (from our newspaper) - The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Works are working hard to build "Small Anshan Steel," determined to overcome various difficulties, complete the first blast furnace ten days ahead of schedule, and strive to produce 30,000 tons of steel and a large amount of pig iron this year.

"Small Anshan Steel" is a medium-sized iron and steel enterprise run by Anshan locally. It was originally planned to start construction in May this year and complete three 78-cubic-meter blast furnaces and two 3-ton converters, as well as part of the rolling mill and machine repair shop, by the end of the year. After full completion next year, it will produce 300,000 tons of iron, 120,000 tons of steel, and a large amount of various types of steel annually. However, during the construction process, there were many difficulties due to the tight supply of smelting equipment and insufficient technical strength. Some cadres lacked confidence in completing the construction tasks. Recently, the Party organization of Anshan Iron and Steel Works criticized the conservative thinking of some cadres, took various emergency measures, and proposed to focus on grasping equipment supply, project progress, and production preparation, and rearranged the project schedule, not only to complete this year's construction plan, but also to strive to produce 30,000 tons of steel and a large amount of pig iron. The workers also held a leap forward oath-taking rally the other day, expressing their determination to "never give up until the iron flows and surely realize 30,000 tons of steel."

Now, a scene of busy work is presented on the construction site of "Small Anshan Steel." The installation workers have already installed the furnace body, hoist, and three hot blast stoves of the first small blast furnace and other equipment, and recently proposed to ensure that No. 1 blast furnace produces iron on the 20th, and the second one also produces iron in October. Behind the blast furnace, the factory buildings of the two steelmaking and rolling mills have already stood up, and the converter is about to begin installation.

The workers responsible for production preparation are actively preparing "food" and fuel for the blast furnace. More than 150 ironmaking workers are stepping up their studies, striving to make the blast furnace produce normally from the very beginning.

    鞍山重新安排工程进度
    加紧建设小鞍钢
    本报鞍山11日电　鞍山钢铁厂的职工们，正在紧张建设“小鞍钢”，决定克服各种困难，提前十天建成第一座高炉，争取今年就生产三万吨钢和大量的生铁。
    “小鞍钢”是鞍山地方举办的中型钢铁企业，原计划从今年5月开始建设，到年底建成三座七十八立方公尺的高炉和两座三吨转炉，以及轧钢、机修车间的一部分，明年全部建成后，每年将生产三十万吨铁、十二万吨钢和大量各种类型的钢材。但是在建设过程中，由于冶炼设备供应紧张，技术力量不足，困难很多。有些干部对完成建设任务信心不足。最近，鞍山钢铁厂的党组织批判了部分干部的保守思想，采取各种紧急措施，提出以抓设备供应、工程进度、生产准备为重点，重新安排了工程进度，不仅要完成今年的建设计划，还要争取生产三万吨钢和大量生铁。职工群众也在前两天举行了跃进誓师大会，表示了“铁水不流誓不甘休，三万吨钢铁定实现”的决心。
    现在，在“小鞍钢”的建设工地上，呈现着一片繁忙的景象，安装工人已经安装好第一座小高炉的炉体、卷扬机和三座热风炉等设备，最近又提出保证一号高炉在20日出铁，第二座也要在10月份出铁。在高炉后面，两座炼钢和轧钢车间的厂房已经矗立起来，转炉也即将开始安装。
    负责生产准备工作的职工，正在积极为高炉准备“粮食”和燃料。一百五十多个炼铁工人正在加紧学习，争取一开始就使高炉正常生产。
