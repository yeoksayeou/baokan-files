　　Technology Delivered to the Furnace
　　Ministry of Metallurgical Industry Organizes Ten Thousand-Strong Technical Force to Assist Provinces in Producing More Steel

　　(Our dispatch) To fulfill the great political task set by the Party Central Committee to double steel production this year and achieve an annual steel output of 10.7 million tons, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is taking various effective measures. Currently, the ministry is drawing technical forces from all aspects and sending them to provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, to go up the mountains and down to the factories, to the sides of blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and converters, so as to work with the broad masses of workers and staff and achieve "one furnace produces iron, ten thousand furnaces produce iron," and "one furnace produces steel, ten thousand furnaces produce steel."

　　Since September, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has already assigned more than 10,000 graduates of universities, colleges, and technical secondary schools to various locations. At the same time, it has also drawn 1,000 technicians from design institutes, research institutes, cadre schools, and other units in Beijing to form a thousand-person technical team, which has been dispatched to the steel frontlines of various provinces to help solve technical problems. With the help of relevant provinces and cities, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has also drawn nearly 5,800 third and fourth-year students majoring in metallurgy from thirteen universities and technical secondary schools, including Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Northeast Institute of Technology, Chongqing University, Taiyuan Industrial School, Chongqing Steel School, and Shanghai Metallurgical Machinery Industrial School, and temporarily transferred them to work in twenty-five provinces, cities, and autonomous regions and five enterprises directly under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry for half a year to support the production and construction work of the steel industry. Some key provinces have borrowed more than 400 students each. The party and government leadership of the aforementioned universities and schools, in order to fully support the large-scale development of the steel industry in various places, will continue to draw a group of teachers and students to go to the steel frontlines.

　　The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry convened a meeting of the responsible persons of various universities and schools in late August. At present, the work of drawing personnel from various universities and schools has been mostly completed, and they will be dispatched to various places successively before mid-September.

　　This time, students going up the mountains and down to the factories also embodies the policy of combining labor with technology and combining production with education. Students majoring in metallurgy feel very honored to participate in this great political task. They have expressed their desire to immediately go up the mountains and down to the factories to assist various localities in producing iron and steel as soon as possible.

　　技术送到炉边去
    冶金部组织万人技术大军协助各省多出钢铁
    本报讯　冶金工业部为了完成党中央提出把今年钢产量翻一番，完成年产钢一千零七十万吨的伟大政治任务，正在采取各种有效措施。目前，这个部正在抽调各方面的技术力量，派赴全国各省、市、自治区去，上山下厂，到高炉、平炉、转炉旁去，以便同广大职工群众在一起，作到“一炉出铁，万炉出铁”，“一炉出钢，万炉出钢”。
    9月份以来，冶金部已经把今年毕业的大、专、中等技术学校学生一万多名分配到各地去。同时，又从北京的设计院、研究院、干部学校等单位抽调了一千名技术人员组成了千人技术团，派赴各省钢铁前线，去帮助解决技术问题。在有关省、市的帮助下，冶金部还从北京钢铁学院、东北工学院、重庆大学、太原工业学校、重庆钢校、上海冶金机械工业学校等十三所高等学校和中等技术学校的有关冶金专业的三、四年级学生中，抽调了将近五千八百人，借调给全国二十五个省、市、自治区和五个冶金部直属企业工作半年，以支援钢铁工业的生产和建设工作。一些重点省借调到的这批学生，各有四百多名。上述院、校的党、政领导方面，为了全力支援各地大办钢铁工业，还将继续抽调一批教师和学生开赴钢铁前线。
    冶金部在8月下旬召开了各院、校负责人会议，目前各院、校抽调人员的工作已经大部分完毕，9月中旬以前即可先后分赴各地。
    这次学生上山下厂，也体现了劳动与技术相结合、生产与教育相结合的方针。冶金专业的学生对于参加当前这一伟大政治任务，都感到十分光荣。他们纷纷表示要立即上山下厂，协助各地尽快出铁、出钢。
