Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th – Nosaka Sanzō, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, stated in today's "Akahata" that the Japanese Communist Party fully supports Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait.

	In his statement, Nosaka expressed that the Japanese Communist Party firmly supports the Chinese government and the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan, demands that the United States stop its interference in China, and demands the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

	Nosaka pointed out that the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait is caused by the US imperialism's implementation of its aggressive policy, and this tense situation is a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world. Nosaka pointed out that Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the coastal islands of the mainland are all Chinese territory, and the liberation of these islands is the legitimate right of the Chinese government and the Chinese people. The determination of the Chinese people is something that no force can stop or change.

	Nosaka pointed out that China's proposal to resume Sino-US talks does not show China's weakness; on the contrary, it confirms that although China has a firm will to liberate Taiwan, it is making the greatest efforts to ease the tense situation.

	Nosaka then pointed out that the United States and the Kishi Nobusuke government, which follows the United States, have both miscalculated China's strength. Nosaka pointed out that the powerful force of 600 million Chinese people, coupled with the united strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unbreakable fraternal unity of China and the Soviet Union, far exceeds the imperialist forces. If the Kishi Nobusuke government continues to follow the United States' hostile policy towards China, it will bring the danger of destruction to the Japanese nation. Nosaka demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government not assist the United States in provoking war and providing Japanese territory to the United States as a base for aggression, and not adopt a hostile policy towards China.

	At the same time, Nosaka called on the Japanese people to fight to eliminate the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait, defend peace in the Far East, and restore normal relations between Japan and China, and to strive to strengthen solidarity with the Chinese people.

	Progressive groups and trade union leaders in Japan also issued statements today, unanimously expressing their support for Premier Zhou Enlai's statement.

	Kazami Akira, Chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, Uchiyama Kanzō, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, and Tanehashi Shigeru, International Director of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, all unanimously expressed their full support for Premier Zhou Enlai's statement. They also strongly demanded that the United States immediately stop interfering in China's internal affairs.

　　野坂参三谴责美国挑衅行为
　　警告岸政府不要充当帮凶
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三在今天的“赤旗报”上发表谈话说，日本共产党全面支持中国总理周恩来关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明。
    野坂在谈话中表示，日本共产党坚决支持中国政府和中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争，要求美国停止对中国的干涉，并且要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位。
    野坂指出，台湾海峡地区的紧张局势是由于美帝国主义执行侵略政策而引起的，这种紧张局势是对远东和世界和平的严重威胁。野坂指出，台湾、澎湖列岛和大陆沿海各岛屿都是中国的领土，解放这些岛屿是中国政府和中国人民的正当权利。中国人民的决心是任何力量都不能阻止和改变的。
    野坂指出，中国提议恢复中美会谈，并不表现中国的软弱，相反地证实了中国虽然抱有解放台湾的坚决意志，但是为了缓和紧张局势正在作着最大的努力。
    野坂接着指出，美国和追随美国的岸信介政府都错误估计了中国的力量。野坂指出，六亿中国人民的强大力量加上以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结的力量和中苏两国的牢不可破的兄弟般的团结的力量远远超过了帝国主义势力。岸信介政府如果继续追随美国采取的敌视中国的政策，将会为日本民族招致灭亡的危险。野坂要求岸信介政府不要协助美国挑起战争和把日本领土提供给美国作为侵略基地，并且不要采取敌视中国的政策。
    野坂同时号召日本人民为消除台湾海峡的紧张局势、保卫远东和平和恢复日中正常关系而进行斗争，并且努力加强同中国人民的团结。
    日本的进步团体和工会领袖今天也分别发表谈话，一致表示支持周恩来总理的声明。
    恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章、日中友好协会理事长内山完造和日本工会总评议会国际部长种桥茂都一致表示全面支持周恩来总理的声明。他们还强烈要求美国立即停止对中国内政的干涉。
