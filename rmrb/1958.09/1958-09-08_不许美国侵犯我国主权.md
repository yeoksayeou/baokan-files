　　Do Not Allow the United States to Infringe Upon Our National Sovereignty
    Li Dequan
    The statement issued by Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China on September 6, 1958, on behalf of our government, is a firm protest by our 600 million people against the war provocations openly carried out against our country by U.S. imperialism. Our 600 million people will never allow U.S. imperialism to infringe upon the sacred rights of our people, never allow interference in our internal affairs, and we cannot tolerate the United States supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has long been abandoned by our 600 million people!

    The government of the People's Republic of China and our 600 million people have always loved peace and have always been united with all peace-loving people around the world in building undertakings for the happiness of the people. But we will never allow foreign interference. If any country infringes upon our territory or interferes in our internal affairs, our 600 million people vow to fight it to the end and will never give up until our goal is achieved.
                September 6, 1958

　　不许美国侵犯我国主权
    李德全
    1958年9月6日我中华人民共和国周恩来总理代表我国政府发表的声明，正是代表我六亿人民对公然向我国进行战争挑衅的美帝国主义的坚决抗议。我六亿人民绝不容许美帝国主义侵犯我国人民的神圣权利，绝不容许干涉我国的内政，我们不能容忍美国支持被我六亿人民早已唾弃的蒋介石集团！
    我中华人民共和国政府和我国六亿人民向来是爱好和平的，向来是与全世界一切爱好和平的人民团结一致建设人民幸福的事业的。但是我们绝不容许外国的无理干涉。任何国家侵犯我国领土，干涉我国内政，我六亿人民誓死要与它斗争到底，不达目的绝不罢休。
                1958年9月6日
