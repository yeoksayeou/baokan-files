Eisenhower delivered a television address to the nation on September 11 regarding the situation in the Taiwan area. His speech was nonsensical, incoherent, and turned right and wrong upside down, not worth refuting. Why did Eisenhower suddenly resort to deception and intimidation towards the world at this time? This is because the people of the world (including the American people), and even many within the imperialist bloc, are increasingly expressing strong dissatisfaction with the US government's continued war provocations. Despite Dulles issuing a series of delirious statements, attempting to conceal the aggressive nature of American actions and threatening the Chinese people, he has neither fooled the general public nor intimidated the Chinese people. As the agent of the US monopoly capital group, Dulles has become discredited, and Eisenhower has had to step forward.

Eisenhower is a wolf in sheep's clothing. When US imperialism invaded Korea, Dulles personally directed the war. After the defeat, Truman lost credibility. Dulles brought Eisenhower into the Republican Party to run for president. During the election campaign, Eisenhower feigned advocacy for "peace" and "armistice" to win the majority of votes. In his inaugural address as President of the United States, he used "developing strength" as a guise to advocate for arms expansion and war preparation, while also hypocritically pretending to "detest war." After taking office, he acted like a ventriloquist act. He pretended to advocate for peace, his actions often handled by Dulles, and he only came forward when things became unmanageable. In the past, he played the role more skillfully, and Eisenhower's ugly features were not fully exposed. This time, he still wanted to use his limited capital to talk nonsense and intimidate, but the result was counterproductive, completely exposing the despicable and autocratic nature of this warmonger who disguised himself as a peacemaker. He cursed the People's China as "belligerent and aggressive," but historical facts prove that it is precisely the United States that is "belligerent and aggressive." The clutches of US imperialism's invasion of the Middle East have not yet been withdrawn, and it has extended its clutches to our inland sea islands of Jinmen and Mazu. He falsely accused the Chinese people of "aggression" for liberating their own territory. The Chinese people are exercising sovereignty on their own territory by liberating Taiwan. What "aggression" is there to speak of? The Chinese people have never advocated occupying American islands or territories, let alone attacking the American mainland, like the American aggressor groups. The Chinese people have never said they would use atomic bombs against the United States. China has not dispatched its navy and air force to the American coast to provoke. "It is shocking that in this day and age, some people are using naked force to achieve such aggressive goals." Eisenhower's words are precisely about himself.

Eisenhower's speech, like their invasion of Lebanon and Taiwan, does not indicate America's strength, but only a manifestation of digging its own grave. On the one hand, it aroused the great anger of the people of the world and the Chinese people, and on the other hand, it made the people more aware that US imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, riddled with holes, yet still baring its fangs and claws.

Dulles cannot deceive people, and neither can Eisenhower; Dulles' statements cannot intimidate the Chinese people, and neither can Eisenhower's speech. His blatant war threats to the Chinese people only prove that he and Dulles are birds of a feather, and the Chinese people are not to be taken lightly. If he dares to provoke China, the Chinese people will, together with the people of the world, bury them.

    艾森豪威尔的丑相毕露
    吴玉章
    9月11日，艾森豪威尔就台湾地区的局势向全国发表了一篇电视演说。他的演说胡说八道，神智不清，是非颠倒，不值一驳。为什么艾森豪威尔这时突然向世界进行欺骗和恫吓呢？这是因为全世界人民（包括美国人民），以至帝国主义集团内部的许多人，对美国政府继续进行战争挑衅越来越表示强烈的不满，尽管杜勒斯一连发了几次呓症一样的声明，力图掩盖美国行动的侵略性质，威胁中国人民，但是既没有骗得广大公众，也没有吓倒中国人民。作为美国垄断资本集团代理人的杜勒斯，已经搞臭了，艾森豪威尔不得不出场。
    艾森豪威尔是个白面狼。当美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的时候，杜勒斯亲自指挥，战事打败了以后，杜鲁门威信扫地，杜勒斯拉艾森豪威尔入共和党来竞选总统，艾森豪威尔在竞选期间，伪装主张“和平”“停战”，争得多数选票。在他就任美国总统时的就职演说中，他一方面用“发展实力”作幌子鼓吹扩军备战，一方面又极端虚伪地装作“憎恶战争”的样子。他上台以后，像演双簧一样，他装得似乎主张和平，他的作法常常由杜勒斯出面，到不能收拾的时候，他才出来。过去扮演得还巧妙一点，艾森豪威尔的丑相还没有全露出来。这次他还想利用他仅有的一点本钱，胡说八道，吓唬一下，结果适得其反，彻底暴露了这个伪装和平的好战分子的卑鄙和专横。他咒骂人民中国是“好战的和侵略成性的”，而历史事实证明，“好战的和侵略成性的”正是美国。美帝国主义侵略中东的魔爪还没有收回，又把它的魔爪伸到了我国的内海岛屿金门和马祖。他诬蔑中国人民解放自己的领土是“进行侵略”，中国人民解放台湾是在自己的领土上行使主权，有什么“侵略”可言？中国人民从来没有像美国侵略集团那样主张占领美国的岛屿或领土以至进攻美国大陆。中国人民也从来没有说要对美国使用原子弹。中国也没有派遣自己的海空军到美国的沿海去挑衅。“令人震惊的是，在现在这个时代，竟有人利用赤裸裸的武力来达到这种侵略目的。”艾森豪威尔的这番话正是说的他自己。
    艾森豪威尔的讲演，如同他们侵略黎巴嫩、侵略台湾等地一样，并不能表明美国的强大，只是自掘坟墓的表现，它一方面激起了全世界人民和中国人民的极大愤怒，一方面使人民更加认识到美帝国主义的外强中干，满身窟窿，还张牙舞爪。
    杜勒斯骗不了人，艾森豪威尔同样也骗不了人；杜勒斯的声明吓不倒中国人民，艾森豪威尔的讲话同样也吓不倒中国人民。他向中国人民发出露骨的战争威胁，只能证明他和杜勒斯只不过是一丘之貉，中国人民是不放在眼中的。如果他竟敢在太岁头上动土，中国人民将和世界人民一起，把他们埋葬。
