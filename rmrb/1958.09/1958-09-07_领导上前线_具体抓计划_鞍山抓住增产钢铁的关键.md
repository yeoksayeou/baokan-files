Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 6th: Reporter Sun Minghui reports: Ansteel's recent experience of rapidly improving production demonstrates that, to ensure the completion of the production leap forward plan, leading cadres must go into detail and focus on daily, shift, and furnace plans.

Based on the experience of the past ten days, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently made a decision for secretaries to go down to factories, managers to take shifts, and leaders at all levels to grasp concrete plans, and stipulated a system to ensure that every second and every furnace is fought for.

Ansteel's implementation of the production leap forward plan for the first seven months of this year was not good enough. To change this situation, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made an inspection and new deployment of Ansteel's production on August 15th. The municipal party secretary and company manager were reassigned to strengthen leadership and inspection in key factories and mines. The situation in the past ten days has shown that wherever leaders personally go to the front line, eat, live, and labor with the workers, and concretely grasp daily, shift, and furnace plans, the production situation rapidly improves. Yang Kejing, the municipal party secretary responsible for the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant and No. 2 Steelmaking Plant, goes to the site every day to check the arrangement and implementation of the day's plan and help solve specific problems. On the 29th, the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant planned to produce twenty-eight furnaces of steel that day. Yang Kejing, based on his understanding of the situation in the plant, requested to modify the daily plan and strive for thirty-two furnaces, and helped solve the difficulties in implementation. As a result, the workers gave full play to their enthusiasm and spirit of cooperation, and finally produced thirty-two furnaces of steel that day. Responsible cadres such as the factory director, party secretary, and party committee members of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant have been assigned to follow shifts and concretely grasp the production plan of each shift and each furnace in the past ten days, and study the experiences and lessons of the day every day, and propose production measures for the next day, thereby greatly shortening the smelting time of open hearth furnaces. From August 23rd to 31st, the number of furnaces smelting steel rapidly in the whole factory accounted for more than 80%, while only about half of the furnaces reached the level of rapid steelmaking in the first and middle ten days of August.

The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of responsible party cadres in the city on the 1st to introduce and promote the production leadership experience of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant and other units. On the 2nd, the Municipal Party Committee held another Standing Committee meeting, emphasizing the strengthening of specific leadership over production. The Standing Committee decided that the municipal party secretary and company manager should personally go to the front line every day to grasp the daily plan, and promptly help the factory solve the specific problems in realizing the daily plan, and encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. The Ansteel Company manager will implement a night shift system starting today to ensure that there are managers helping enterprises solve problems 24 hours a day. At the same time, the Standing Committee members of the Municipal Party Committee and the company manager will focus on studying production issues twice a week. Leading cadres at all levels must grasp the daily plan, shift plan, and furnace plan. Every furnace of steel and every furnace of iron must be carefully and deeply grasped from charging to tapping. Enterprise leading cadres must move to the factory and eat, live, and labor with the workers. At the same time, focusing on key production issues, a large-scale technical revolution should be launched, and socialist competition and evaluation movements should be carried out to ensure that September becomes a "high-yield month" for steel production, laying a good foundation for realizing the leap forward plan for the whole year.

### 领导上前线　具体抓计划  鞍山抓住增产钢铁的关键

　　领导上前线　具体抓计划
    鞍山抓住增产钢铁的关键
    据新华社鞍山6日电　记者孙铭惠报道：鞍钢最近使生产情况迅速好转的经验证明，要保证完成生产跃进计划，领导干部必须深入细致地大抓日计划、班计划、炉计划。
    根据过去十多天来的经验，中共鞍山市委最近作出了书记下厂、经理值班、各级领导抓具体计划的决定，并且规定制度，保证做到分秒必争、每炉必争。
    鞍钢今年头七个多月生产跃进计划执行情况不够好。为了改变这种情况，中共鞍山市委在8月15日对鞍钢的生产作了检查和新的部署，市委书记和公司经理都重新分工，深入重点厂矿加强领导检查。十多天来的情况表明，凡是领导亲临前线，同工人同吃同住同劳动，具体抓日计划、班计划、炉计划的单位，生产情况便迅速好转。分工负责第一炼钢厂、第二炼钢厂的市委书记杨克冰，每天都到现场检查当天计划的安排和执行情况，帮助解决具体问题。29日，第一炼钢厂当天计划出二十八炉钢，杨克冰根据在厂里了解的情况，要求修改日计划，争取出三十二炉，并且帮助解决执行中的困难。结果，工人们发挥干劲和协作精神，这一天终于出了三十二炉钢。第一炼钢厂厂长、党委书记、党委委员等负责干部，在过去十几天里都分工跟班劳动，具体抓每个班每个炉子的生产计划，并且每天研究当天的经验教训，提出第二天的生产措施，从而使平炉的熔炼时间大大缩短。从8月23日到31日，全厂快速炼钢的炉数占到了80％以上，而8月上中两旬只有一半左右的炉数达到了快速炼钢的水平。
    中共鞍山市委1日召开全市党员负责干部会议，介绍和推广第一炼钢厂等单位领导生产的经验。2日，市委又召开常委会，强调加强对生产的具体领导。常委会决定：市委书记和公司经理每天都要亲临前线抓日计划，及时帮助厂里解决每天实现日计划当中的具体问题，鼓舞广大职工的干劲。鞍钢公司经理从今天起实行值夜班制度，保证每天二十四小时内都有经理帮助企业解决问题，同时市委常委和公司经理每周要集中研究两次生产问题。各级领导干部都要抓日计划、班计划、炉计划，每一炉钢、每一炉铁从装料到出钢，都必须细致深入地抓；企业领导干部要搬到厂里，同工人同吃同住同劳动。同时，围绕生产关键问题，大闹技术革命，开展社会主义竞赛和评比运动，保证9月份成为钢铁生产的“高产月”，为实现全年跃进计划打下良好基础。
