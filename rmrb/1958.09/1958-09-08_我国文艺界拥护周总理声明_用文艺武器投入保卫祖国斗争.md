Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles、Chinese Writer's Association、Chinese Dramatists Association、Chinese Musicians Association、Chinese Artists Association、Chinese Ballad Singers Association、Chinese Dance Research Association、Chinese Folk Literature and Art Research Association、China Film Workers Association、China Photographic Society and other ten organizations, jointly issued a statement on September 7, resolutely supporting Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region. The full text is as follows:

    China's literary and art circles resolutely support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region.

    China's literary and art circles resolutely oppose the United States' war threats and military provocations!

    The Chinese people have the sacred right and obligation to liberate our country's territory. Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, Jinmen, and Matsu Islands have always been our country's territory. The Chinese people have every right to take all appropriate methods, at appropriate times, to liberate their own territory, and no foreign interference is allowed. The American aggressors have long occupied our country's Taiwan and the Penghu Islands; now, in order to further expand their scope of aggression from Taiwan to Jinmen and Matsu, they are absurdly creating excuses, attempting to obliterate the Chinese people's natural and just sovereignty, increasing troops in the Taiwan Strait, and wantonly creating war threats and military provocations. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

    The long-tempered Chinese people cannot be intimidated! The United States' war provocations will only arouse even greater anger among the people of the whole country.

    We resolutely respond to the call of the Supreme State Conference: The people of the whole country must be mobilized to fight resolutely against the military provocations and war threats of U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait region. China's literary and art circles resolutely mobilize all forces and use all literary and artistic weapons to join the sacred struggle to defend the motherland and defend peace!

    We believe that if the American aggressors blatantly disregard the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and the peace wishes of the people of the world, continue to interfere in and invade China, and impose war on the Chinese people, the Chinese people will absolutely not fear war, and the American aggressors will definitely be battered and bloody.

    Victory will surely belong to the just and peace-loving Chinese people!

    我国文艺界拥护周总理声明
　　用文艺武器投入保卫祖国斗争
    新华社7日讯　中国文学艺术界联合会、中国作家协会、中国戏剧家协会、中国音乐家协会、中国美术家协会、中国曲艺工作者协会、中国舞蹈艺术研究会、中国民间文艺研究会、中国电影工作者联谊会、中国摄影学会等十个团体，在9月7日联合发表声明，坚决拥护周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明。全文如下：
    中国文艺界坚决拥护周恩来总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明。
    中国文艺界坚决反对美国的战争威胁和军事挑衅！
    中国人民有神圣的权利和义务解放我国的领土。台湾、澎湖列岛、金门及马祖等岛屿，从来就是我国的领土。中国人民完全有权采取一切适当的方法，在适当的时候，解放自己的领土，不容许任何外国的干涉。美国侵略者长期霸占了我国的台湾及澎湖列岛；现在，又进一步为了把自己的侵略范围从台湾扩大到金门、马祖，荒谬绝伦地制造借口，妄图抹杀中国人民天经地义的主权，增兵台湾海峡，肆无忌惮地制造战争威胁和军事挑衅。这是我国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    久经锻炼的中国人民是吓不倒的！美国的战争挑衅只会激起全国人民更大的愤怒。
    我们坚决响应最高国务会议的号召：全国人民一致动员起来，为坚决反对美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅和战争威胁而斗争。中国文艺界坚决动员一切力量，运用一切的文艺武器，投入保卫祖国，保卫和平的神圣斗争！
    我们认为：如果美国侵略者悍然不顾中国人民的再三警告和世界人民的和平愿望，继续对中国进行干涉和侵略，把战争强加在中国人民的头上，中国人民绝对不怕战争，美国侵略者一定会碰得头破血流。
    胜利一定属于正义的、保卫和平的中国人民！
