The East Wind Awakens the "Superstition King"
　　No One in Huaxi Believes in Ghosts and Gods
　　Deng Shihai, an old man from the Jinlong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, had a catchphrase: "Without gods, people can't move an inch." He had a bronze Buddha statue at home, weighing more than thirty catties. When Japanese imperialism invaded, he fled with this Buddha statue in his arms. This year, he even hung red on the Buddha. Seeing the crops in the cooperative growing particularly well, he feared natural disasters and burned incense to pray: "Protect us from dam collapses this year, and may our granaries be full of grain." The cooperative members gave him the nickname: "Superstition King."
　　In mid-August, the township launched a tool reform movement centered on vigorously developing ball bearings. The masses consciously and voluntarily carried out the four contributions (contributing materials, funds, technology, and suggestions). Many people contributed their copper and tinware. Deng Shihai began a fierce ideological struggle. He thought: Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, life has been getting better and better every day. For decades, he had respected gods and relied on the Buddha, but he had not relied on anything. Only by listening to the Communist Party and breaking with superstition is the right path. Finally, he contributed the Buddha. When he started moving the Buddha, he recited a clapper rhyme to the Buddha:
　　"Buddha, Buddha, don't blame me,
　　Please step down quickly.
　　I have respected you for many generations,
　　But you have done nothing to change the old ox plowing the field.
　　This year we will realize mechanization,
　　I want you to shed your bones and be reborn."
　　In Guizhou Province, the Weiqi Township Jiangyu Agricultural Production Cooperative does a great job in all aspects, but the superstitious idea of believing in Buddha still confuses some people. The members of the cooperative all enshrine shrines at home and often burn incense and kowtow. After studying the general line and debating "Whether there are Buddhas," the youth of this cooperative generally improved their understanding. Everyone calculated a detailed account: every year, buying incense, candles, and paper costs an average of eight yuan per household. With one hundred and fifty households in the cooperative, one thousand two hundred yuan is wasted a year. After the calculation, everyone felt the pain of spending this unjust money and aroused resentment towards "gods and ghosts." The youth of this cooperative sang:
　　"The rice seedlings are green in the big fields and dams,
　　Thinking of ghosts and gods is really chilling:
　　If you get sick and don't get treatment,
　　Believing in gods and ghosts will kill you.
　　"Magpies chirp on the trees,
　　Eliminate superstition and remove the Buddhas;
　　Save funds to support production,
　　Guarantee a large increase in income."
　　The youth first took the initiative to dismantle the divine tablets in their own homes, and then mobilized other cooperative members to dismantle them. After a few days of mobilization and propaganda, all the households in the cooperative dismantled the divine tablets, pasted Chairman Mao's portraits, and everywhere was a new atmosphere. The members of the cooperative sang happily:
　　"The stars in the sky are shining brightly,
　　The general line is a bright light.
　　Breaking with superstition and making a great leap forward,
　　We want to turn loess into gold.
　　We want to sing the Leap Forward song,
　　We want to cross the Clear Water River.
　　Construction must follow the general line,
　　A happy life is reliable."
　　Not long ago, Huaxi District in Guiyang City held a three-level cadre meeting for the district, township, and cooperative. The meeting proposed to eliminate superstition and let the forces that have served "gods" and "ghosts" for many years also serve our construction cause. Yang Daming (Buyi nationality), the party branch secretary of Luoping Township, returned to his hometown, Luoping Village, during the meeting to publicize atheism to the masses and proposed to abolish the practice of respecting gods and ghosts, which was warmly supported by the masses. They said: We have long wanted to stop respecting gods and ghosts, but no one "took the lead." In less than half a day, the masses abolished all the shrines and divine tablets, and contributed the utensils for respecting gods and ghosts. The party and government leaders of Huaxi District immediately led all the participants of the three-level cadre meeting to Luoping Village for on-site observation. After the meeting, the cadres conveyed the practices of Luoping Village to various places, so that every household in the district abolished the shrines and divine tablets, and donated superstitious utensils. At a mass meeting of more than two thousand people in Jiu'an Township, the masses contributed twenty god cabinets, three hundred and fifty shrine boards, and three hundred and ninety qing chimes. In Qingyan Cooperative, 60% of the shrine boards have been made into wheelbarrows. All the witches and Taoists in the district have also changed their professions and participated in industrial and agricultural production. Su Shuqing, a Taoist in Zhongcao Township, also contributed his family's ancestral shrine tablet, which had been preserved for more than three hundred years, and made it into a wheelbarrow.
　　Now, Huaxi District has become a "god"-free zone.

### 东风吹醒“迷信王”  花溪无人信鬼神

　　东风吹醒“迷信王”
　　花溪无人信鬼神
    湖北江陵县金龙农业生产合作社邓世海老大爷有一句口头禅：“人无神，寸步难行。”他家里供着一尊铜菩萨，净重三十多斤。日本帝国主义进犯时，他是抱着这尊菩萨逃难的。今年他还给菩萨挂过红。他看见社里庄稼长得特别好，怕有自然灾害，就焚香祷告：“保佑今年不倒堤，粮食收满仓。”社员们就给他起一个绰号：“迷信大王”。
    8月中旬，乡里开展以大搞滚珠轴承为中心的工具改革运动，群众纷纷自觉自愿地进行四献（献物资、献资金、献技术、献计策）。许多人都把家里的铜器、锡器献了出来。邓世海开始了激烈的思想斗争。他想：解放几年来，在共产党领导下，日子一天过得比一天好。几十年来敬神靠菩萨，什么也没有靠上。只有听共产党的话，破除迷信，才是正道。最后他终于将菩萨献了出来。在动手搬菩萨时，他对着菩萨念了一首快板：
    “菩萨菩萨你莫怪，
    请你赶快下台来。
    我敬了你多少代，
    老牛耕地你一点不改。
    今年实现机械化，
    我要你脱骨又换胎。”
    贵州省普定县魏旗乡讲玉农业生产合作社各项工作都搞得很好，就是信菩萨的迷信思想还迷糊着一部分人。社员家家供着神位，经常烧香跪拜。这个社的青年们经过总路线的学习，又经过“有没有菩萨”的辩论，普遍提高了觉悟。大家算了一个细账：每年光是买香、烛、纸平均每户要花八元钱。全社一百五十户，一年就浪费一千二百元。经过算账，大家都觉得这笔冤枉钱花得肉痛，激起了对“神鬼”的愤恨。这个社的青年们唱道：
    “大田大坝秧苗青，
    提起鬼神真寒心：
    生了疾病不医治，
    信神信鬼害死人。
    “喜鹊树上叫喳喳，
    破除迷信除菩萨；
    节约资金援生产，
    保证收入大增加。”
    青年们首先动手拆掉自己家里的神榜，然后动员别的社员拆。经过几天动员宣传，全社家家拆了神榜，贴上毛主席像，到处一番新气象。社员们高兴地唱道：
    “天上星星亮晶晶，
    总路线呀是明灯。
    破除迷信大跃进，
    黄土要它变成金。
    唱歌要唱跃进歌，
    过河要过清水河。
    建设要走总路线，
    幸福生活靠得着。”
    不久以前，贵阳市花溪区召开了区、乡、社三级干部大会。会上提出要破除迷信，让那些多少年来为“神”、“鬼”服务的力量也来为我们的建设事业服务。洛坪乡党支部书记杨大明（布依族），在开会期间就回到自己的家乡——洛坪小寨，向群众宣传无神论，提出取消敬神敬鬼的倡议，得到了群众的热烈支持。他们说：我们很早就想不敬神鬼了，就是无人“承头”。不到半天的时间，群众就把所有的神道、神榜取消了，并将敬神敬鬼用具都献出来。花溪区党、政领导立即带领参加三级干部会的全体人员到洛坪小寨作现场参观。会后，干部们把洛坪小寨的作法传达到各地，于是全区家家户户都取消了神道、神榜，并把迷信用具捐献出来。久安乡在一个二千多人的群众大会上，就收到了群众献出的神柜二十个、神道板三百五十块、罄三百九十个。在青岩社，60％的神道板都已作了鸡公车。全区巫婆、道士也全部改了行，参加了工农业生产。中曹乡道士苏树青还把他家保存了三百多年的神道牌献出来，作了鸡公车。
    现在，花溪区已成为无“神”区。
