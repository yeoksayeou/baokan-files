    Bean Leaves Can Cure Maggots
    I remember when I was little, I heard my third great uncle say, "Bean leaves can kill maggots." It just so happened that my pickled vegetable crock and toilet had a lot of maggots, so I picked some bean leaves and put them inside. After three days, all the maggots in the toilet and pickled vegetable crock were gone. Since then, whenever there were maggots in my pickled vegetable crock, I used this method. Last year, my broad bean paste also grew maggots. I picked more than a dozen bean leaves, washed them with water, and put them in the jar. After three days, the maggots disappeared. Now that the Party is calling on us to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene, I am putting forward this method in the hope that it will be promoted.

    云豆叶子能治蛆虫
    记得小的时候，听我三大爷说“云豆叶子能药死蛆虫”，正好我家的咸菜缸和厕所里生了很多的蛆，我就采了些云豆叶子放在里边，过三天后厕所和咸菜缸里的蛆全部没有了。以后每逢家里的咸菜缸里有蛆时，我就用这个办法。去年我家的豆瓣酱里也生了蛆，我又采了十几个云豆叶子用水洗净放在坛子里，三天后蛆也都不见了。现在党号召我们除四害讲卫生，我提出这个办法，希望推广。
