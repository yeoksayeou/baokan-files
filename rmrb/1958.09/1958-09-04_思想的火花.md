Sparks of Thought

    Size is Up to Me
    Small effort, big difficulties; big effort, small difficulties.
                          (Excerpt from a discussion meeting record)
    Difficulty is Like a Spring
    Difficulty is like a spring, depending on how strong you are;
    If you are strong, it will be weak; if you are weak, it will be strong.
                                       (Yu Xuemin, Sichuan)
    Mountain Climbing
    Engaging in technological revolution is like climbing a big mountain. People who feel weak at the sight of a mountain will never reach the top. A mountain can never be taller than two human legs. With each step you climb, you stand higher, see farther, have more courage, and advance faster. Those who reach the summit are not afraid of the mountain's height.
                            (Wang Minzhang, Hankou Jiang'an Freight Car Repair Factory)
    Combining Learning and Doing
    A worker's family member became the director of a hardware factory. He said to people: "I'm a director in a small factory and an apprentice in a big factory, learning and doing at the same time, both well and fast."
                           (Excerpt from a journalist's notes)

　　思想的火花
    大小由我
    小干大困难，大干小困难。
                          （摘自一个讨论会的发言纪录）
    困难像弹簧
    困难像弹簧，看你强不强；
    你强它就弱，你弱它就强。
                                       （四川余学民）
    爬山
    闹技术革命像爬大山。见山就腿软的人，永远也爬不上山顶。山高高不过人两腿。每爬上一步，站得就更高，看得就更远，勇气就更足，前进也就更快。到达山顶的是不怕山高的人。
                            （汉口江岸货车修理厂　王敏璋）
    学做结合
    一个工人家属，当了五金厂的厂长。对人说：“俺在小厂里当厂长，大厂里当学徒，边学边做，又好又快”。
                           （摘自一个新闻记者的笔记）
