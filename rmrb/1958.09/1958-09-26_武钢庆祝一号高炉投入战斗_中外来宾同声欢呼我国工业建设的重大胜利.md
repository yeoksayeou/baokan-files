Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 25th: More than 20,000 people gathered in Wuhan Iron and Steel (WISCO) Square today to celebrate the completion and iron tapping of WISCO's No. 1 Blast Furnace, currently the largest and one of the most advanced blast furnaces in the world.

Attending today's celebration were Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Xia Yun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry; Shevakov, head of the Soviet delegation invited by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to attend the No. 1 Blast Furnace celebration; Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and others. Xu Dama, a revolutionary mother from Hong'an County, and Fang Heming, a veteran Red Army regimental commander, also made a special trip to congratulate. Soviet experts in the Wuhan area and guests from Bulgaria, Romania, Vietnam, Argentina, and Australia also attended the conference.

The weather was clear today, and the WISCO construction site was filled with a festive atmosphere. Colorful archways were erected at various companies, construction sites, and factories. Red flags fluttered on every building. Giant slogans were hung on the two chimneys beside the blast furnace, which were more than 100 meters high. They read, "The completion of WISCO's No. 1 Blast Furnace is a victory for the Party's leadership!" and "The completion of WISCO's No. 1 Blast Furnace is a victory for implementing the Party's general line for building socialism!" In front of the blast furnace, a horizontal banner slogan expressing the will and determination of the more than 50,000 WISCO employees was hung: "WISCO employees, mobilize and strive to ensure the production of 250,000 tons of iron and 70,000 tons of steel this year!"

The guests who came to visit were indescribably happy. Xu Dama was so happy that she couldn't speak as soon as she arrived at WISCO. She said, "In the past, it was difficult to even get a little iron for the spinning wheel. With steel, everything is easy." Fang Heming said with emotion: "In the past, we had nothing when we made revolution. Guns and cannons had to be seized from the enemy. Now, with the combination of large, medium, and small [enterprises], what are we worried about with steel!"

At today's celebration, Xia Yun, Zhang Pinghua, and others spoke. They unanimously pointed out that the early completion and iron tapping of WISCO's No. 1 Blast Furnace is a major victory in China's industrial construction and a great happy event for the people of the whole country. They sincerely expressed their warm congratulations to the WISCO builders and the Soviet experts at WISCO.

Shevakov, head of the Soviet delegation, also spoke at the meeting. He said that the Soviet government not only has given and is giving WISCO material assistance, but will also help WISCO complete all its projects and develop the increasingly consolidated friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people with fraternal enthusiasm in the future.

At the meeting, Li Yiqing, General Manager of WISCO, on behalf of the 50,000 employees of the entire factory, expressed his gratitude to all brother factories and mines across the country that supported the construction of WISCO and to the Soviet experts who helped WISCO build. He also expressed that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the provincial and municipal committees, they will continue to learn humbly, constantly improve their work, and move from one victory to another with full confidence.

The conference concluded with a ribbon-cutting ceremony by Xia Yun. At this time, more than a thousand peace doves flew up, and colorful balloons slowly flew into the sky.

Since iron tapping began on the afternoon of September 13, WISCO's No. 1 Blast Furnace has been producing normally, and the iron output has been increasing batch by batch and day by day. The furnace output and daily output have approached the design targets.

    新华社武汉25日电  两万多人今天在武钢广场上集会，隆重庆祝我国目前最大的、世界上第一流的高炉——武钢一号高炉的建成和出铁。
    今天来参加庆祝典礼的，有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒，冶金工业部副部长夏耘，应冶金工业部邀请来参加一号高炉庆祝典礼的苏联代表团团长谢瓦柯夫，中共湖北省委书记张平化等。红安县的革命母亲徐大妈和红军老团长方和明，以及各兄弟省市的职工代表、农民代表，也特地赶来祝贺。参加大会的还有在武汉地区的苏联专家和来自保加利亚、罗马尼亚、越南、阿根廷、澳大利亚的来宾。
    今天天气晴朗，武钢工地一片节日景象。各个公司、工地、工厂都搭起了彩色的牌楼。各个建筑物上红旗飘扬。高炉两旁高达一百多公尺的两个烟囱上，都悬挂着巨幅标语，上面写着“武钢一号高炉的建成是党的领导的胜利！”“武钢一号高炉建成是执行党的建设社会主义总路线的胜利！”在高炉前面，悬挂着表示武钢五万多职工的意志和决心的横幅标语：“武钢职工动员起来，为确保今年生产二十五万吨铁、七万吨钢而奋斗！”
    前来参观的来宾，内心里都有说不出的高兴。徐大妈一到武钢就喜得说不出话来。她说：“从前连纺车上用点铁都很难，有了钢铁，啥事都好办了。”方和明感慨地说：“从前闹革命啥也没有，枪炮要从敌人手里夺过来；现在大中小结合，有了钢铁还愁啥子！”
    在今天的庆祝会上，夏耘、张平化等都讲了话。他们一致指出，武钢一号高炉提前建成出铁，是我国工业建设上的重大胜利，是全国人民的一件大喜事。他们衷心地向武钢建设者和在武钢的苏联专家表示热烈祝贺。

    会上，武钢总经理李一清代表全厂五万个职工，向支援武钢建设的全国各兄弟厂矿和帮助武钢建设的苏联专家致谢意，并且表示：要在党中央和省市委的领导下，继续虚心学习，不断改进工作，满怀信心地由一个胜利走向另一个胜利。
    大会最后由夏耘剪彩。这时，一千多只和平鸽子翩翩飞起，彩色的气球也缓缓地飞向天空。
    武钢一号高炉从9月13日下午出铁以来，生产一直正常，出铁量逐炉逐日提高，炉产量和日产量都已接近设计指标。
