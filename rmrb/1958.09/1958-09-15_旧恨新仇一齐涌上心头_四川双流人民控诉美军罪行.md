Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Dispatch: The people of Shuangliu County, Sichuan Province, who suffered the ravages of robbery, kidnapping, and murder by the U.S. military before liberation, have been holding meetings in recent days to accuse the U.S. military of its heinous crimes. Many victims at the meetings shouted: "The blood debt owed by U.S. imperialism must be repaid with blood!"

It was in 1941 that the U.S. military built an airport in Shuangliu County, and people, regardless of age or gender, were conscripted as laborers. Yang Yuming, the Party Secretary of Jinhua Township, was only ten years old at the time and was forced to carry earth. Being small, he could not carry much and could not walk fast, so the American soldiers beat him black and blue with fists and sticks. Li Xianyun, a member of the First Cooperative of the Seventh Village of Jinhua Township, accused: In the early winter of 1944, one day when the laborers were building the airport runway, an American plane suddenly landed. Instead of landing on the empty runway, it rushed into the crowd. The laborers panicked and tried to escape, but the supervising U.S. military police blocked them with knives and guns, and seven laborers were immediately killed under the plane, some with their heads crushed, some with their waists severed, a bloody and horrifying sight. Soon, another American plane rushed into the crowd building the airport, and seven more laborers were crushed to death. Li Xianyun was unable to escape in time, and his arm was also crushed. At the meeting, Li Xianyun gnashed his teeth and raised his sleeve, pointing to the scars on his arm and saying: "This is the evidence of the American devils' crimes, and I must avenge this!"

Raping and killing Chinese women was another bloody crime committed by the U.S. military against the people of Shuangliu. Luo Shaoxian, deputy director of the Eighth Cooperative of the Sixth Village of Jinhua Township, and cooperative member Gan Jicheng, among others, accused that near the airport and the "Allied Forces Reception Center," many women who had been raped by American soldiers and were on the verge of death were often discarded on the roadside or in ditches. There were even more women who were strangled, hacked to death, or thrown into the river to drown because they resisted the atrocities.

The U.S. military's crimes of theft and robbery occurred even more frequently. Liang Jiwu, who ran a small shop near Shuanggui Temple Airport before liberation, accused that one night in the spring of 1945, seven or eight American soldiers suddenly broke in and stole more than seventy bottles of wine. When Liang Jiwu asked them for money, they not only refused to give it but also stabbed him in the corner of the eye with a bayonet. These American soldiers also often broke into nearby farmers' homes to steal things.

The people of Shuangliu will never forget the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism. When they hear that American aggressors are again carrying out military provocations against our people, old hatreds are added to new ones. They resolutely support Premier Zhou's solemn statement and are determined to support the liberation of Taiwan and all coastal islands with all kinds of practical actions. More than two thousand militia cadres throughout the county have expressed that they will redouble their vigilance, work hard to learn the skills of killing the enemy, and if U.S. imperialism dares to invade, they will surely send their dog lives to meet their doom.

    旧恨新仇一齐涌上心头
    四川双流人民控诉美军罪行
    新华社成都电　曾在解放前惨遭美军抢劫掳杀的四川省双流县人民，连日纷纷集会，控诉美军的滔天罪行。许多受害者在会上高呼：“美帝国主义欠下的血债要用血来偿还！”
    那是1941年，美军在双流县修建飞机场，不分老弱妇孺都抓去当民工。金花乡党委书记杨玉明当时年仅十岁，就被抓去挑土，人小挑不动，走不快，美国兵就用拳头和棍子把他打得遍体鳞伤。金花乡七村一社社员李显云控诉说：1944年初冬，有一天民工们正在修建机场的跑道，一架美国飞机突然降下，它不在空着的跑道降落，却偏向人群冲来，民工们慌着躲避，监工的美国宪兵竟用刀枪阻拦，七个民工当即惨死在机下，有的头被碾烂，有的腰被切断，血肉模糊，惨不忍睹。不久，又一架美机冲入正在修建机场的人群，又有七个民工惨遭碾死。李显云当时逃跑不及，手膀也被碾伤。李显云在会上咬牙切齿地捞起衣袖，指着手膀上的伤痕说：“这就是美国鬼子罪行的见证，这个仇我一定要报！”
    奸淫残杀中国妇女，是美军对双流人民犯下的另一血腥罪行。金花乡六村八社副主任罗绍先和社员甘吉成等人控诉说：在机场和“盟军招待所”附近，经常有不少被美国兵强奸得奄奄一息的妇女丢在路旁沟边。至于因为反抗暴行而被勒死、砍死或丢进河里淹死的妇女就更多了。
    美军偷盗抢劫的罪行更是经常发生。解放前在双桂寺机场附近开小店的梁吉武控诉说，1945年春的一个深夜，突然闯来了七、八个美国兵，抢走了七十多瓶酒，梁吉武向他们要钱，他们不但不给，反而用刺刀戳他的眼角。这些美国兵还经常闯入附近农民家里抢东西。
    双流人民永远没有忘记美帝国主义犯下的这些滔天罪行，提起美国侵略者又向我国人民进行军事挑衅，就旧恨加上了新仇。他们坚决拥护周总理的严正声明，决心以各种实际行动支援解放台湾和沿海一切岛屿。全县二千多基干民兵纷纷表示，要加倍提高警惕，努力学好杀敌本领，美帝国主义胆敢来侵犯，定叫他的狗命去见无常。
