Throw the Illiteracy Hat Aside

Following the high tide of the literacy campaign, a new high tide of learning culture and science and technology has emerged in forty-four counties in Yunnan Province.

Of the 5.5 million illiterate people in the province, more than 4 million have enrolled in schools, and 2.2 million have shed their illiteracy hats. Zhaotong Prefecture in the high and cold mountainous area has become the first illiteracy-free prefecture in the province. Luxi and Zhenkang counties in the Yunnan border minority areas, which not long ago used wood carvings and knotted ropes for record-keeping, have also basically eliminated illiteracy.

The local Party committees led the masses in refuting various erroneous ideas such as "conditionalism" and "backwardness" in literacy work, and launched a mass learning and universal teaching movement. Field edges and corners became classrooms, and the entire mountain became a learning ground. The more intense the production, the more vigorous the learning. With mutual assistance such as relatives teaching relatives, neighbors teaching neighbors, children teaching mothers, and husbands teaching wives, and using the method of teaching with homophones, some areas eliminated illiteracy in a few days of intensive study.

After people of all ethnic groups escaped illiteracy, it was like a joyous event. Some wrote big red couplets at their doors: "The illiteracy hat is heavy, worn for decades, now with the Party's leadership, the illiteracy hat is thrown aside." Others wrote: "A red pen is bright red, not seen for fifteen or sixteen years, now I also use you, to make contributions to the literacy campaign." In Dongchuan Town, Yao'an County, the 830 people who had eliminated illiteracy wrote more than 900 couplets in a few days. After 670,000 young and middle-aged people in Zhaotong Prefecture shed their illiteracy hats, they immediately launched a "Thousand Articles and Ten Thousand Songs" movement. Hundreds of farmers, writers, and poets emerged from the masses. Li Xingmin, a farmer from Yiliang County, just graduated from the literacy program and worked with carpenters to create a wheat seeder suitable for local use. Jian'shan Township, Chengjiang County, the first county in Yunnan Province to eliminate illiteracy, compiled agricultural technology textbooks to meet the needs of the masses to learn agricultural science knowledge. After eliminating illiteracy, Yao'an County in the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture quickly established a political school and a network of spare-time education, science popularization, cultural propaganda, and health care, basically becoming a cultural county. Most of the 27,000 people who just graduated from the literacy program in this county have transferred to more than 400 spare-time study classes, spare-time agricultural technology schools, and red and expert schools. The number of newspaper subscriptions by farmers in the county has greatly increased, and many communes have established mimeographed newspapers.

    文盲帽子甩一边
    云南省四十四个县紧接着扫盲运动高潮之后，又出现了一个学习文化和科学技术的新高潮。
    现在全省五百五十万文盲中，已有四百多万人入学，有二百二十万人摘掉文盲帽子。高寒山区昭通专区成为全省第一个无文盲专区。不久前还是木刻结绳记事的云南边疆少数民族地区的潞西、镇康等县，也基本上扫除了文盲。
    各地党委领导群众驳倒了在扫盲工作上的“条件论”、“落后论”等种种错误思想，掀起了全民学、万人教运动。田边地角当课堂，满山变成学习场，生产越紧张，学习越红火。在亲教亲、邻教邻、子教母、夫教妻等相互帮助之下，利用同音字教学的办法，有些地区几天就突击扫除了文盲。
    各族人民摆脱文盲状态以后，犹如喜事临门，有的在门口写上大红对联：文盲帽子重甸甸，足足带了几十年，如今有了党领导，文盲帽子甩一边。还有的写着：一支红笔红通通，十五六年不相逢，现在我也使用你，要为扫盲立战功。姚安县栋川镇已扫除的八百三十个文盲，几天内，自作自写了对联九百多副。昭通专区六十七万青壮年摘掉文盲帽子以后立即展开了“千篇文章万首歌”运动。群众中涌现出成百上千的农民作家和诗人。彝良县农民李兴民，刚扫盲毕业，就与木工一道创造了适合当地使用的小麦播种机。云南省第一批扫除了文盲的澄江县尖山乡，为了满足群众学农业科学知识的要求，自编了农业技术教材。楚雄彝族自治州姚安县在扫除文盲后，很快建立起政治学校和业余教育、科学普及、文化宣传和卫生医疗网，基本上成为文化县。这个县刚扫盲毕业的两万七千多人，大都转入四百多所业余学习班、业余农业技术学校和红专学校学习。全县农民订阅报纸份数大大增加，许多社创办了油印小报。
