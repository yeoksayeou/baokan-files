Mobilize the Masses to Reform Tools; Utilize Local Methods for Processing and Manufacturing
Harvest, Store, and Utilize Sweet Potatoes Well

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Ministry of Agriculture held a national sweet potato on-site conference in Ding County, Hebei Province, in mid-September, requesting all regions to make every effort to harvest, store, and utilize the large quantities of sweet potatoes well, ensuring a bumper sweet potato harvest.
    According to reports from the eleven provinces and cities attending, including Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, this year's sweet potato planting area is 150 million mu, with a total output of 700 billion jin, and an average yield of about 4,500 jin of fresh sweet potatoes per mu. It is estimated that the total national output of potatoes this year can reach 900 billion jin, equivalent to more than 220 billion jin of grain, accounting for about 60% of the total national grain output last year. The bumper harvest of potatoes will not only increase the total grain output and raise people's income levels, but also provide a solid material foundation for the development of light industry and animal husbandry.
    During the meeting, some people believed that with such a large sweet potato planting area and high yield this year, whether it could all be harvested and properly handled was still a problem. The meeting believed that the difficulties in harvesting and storing sweet potatoes this year can be overcome as long as effective measures are taken and all positive factors are mobilized. Ding County is a good example. This year, Ding County's sweet potato planting area is more than 700,000 mu, with an expected total output of 8.2 billion jin, an average of 12,600 jin per person in the county. Thanks to the county party committee's timely and comprehensive arrangements and preparations, and the serious resolution of the contradiction between harvesting sweet potatoes and other work, it is planned that the county's sweet potatoes can be harvested within 20 days. The slogan they put forward is: "A mighty army is mobilized, harvesting in 20 days, working hard day and night, not leaving the fields until the harvest is complete!" This gave the representatives great encouragement.
    The meeting pointed out that there is great potential for the comprehensive utilization of sweet potatoes. According to materials from relevant units, if 30% of this year's total potato output is used to manufacture alcohol, 13.5 million tons of alcohol can be produced, which can replace 5.4 million tons of gasoline. Moreover, setting up factories is simple and the cost is low, so people's communes and agricultural cooperatives can directly produce it.
    The meeting pointed out that the key to doing a good job in the harvesting, storage, processing and utilization of sweet potatoes is the labor force issue. Therefore, in addition to relying on and mobilizing the masses, strengthening labor organization, unified allocation, concentrating forces, and carrying out phased assaults, it is necessary to vigorously carry out tool reform. During the meeting, representatives from various regions introduced many newly created and modified harvesting and processing tools. Ding County's power harvester can harvest 30 mu of sweet potatoes per day, and the double-furrow plow modified into a harvesting machine also has a good effect. Liaoning's four-horse two-person plow can harvest 18 mu per day, the improved plow created in Xichong County, Sichuan can harvest 4 mu per day, and the improved plow created in Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei can harvest 7 mu per day. These were all greatly welcomed by the representatives. However, the meeting also pointed out that the reform of sweet potato harvesting and processing tools is only a beginning, especially the number of power machinery is still small, and all regions must vigorously carry out animal-powered tool reform to solve the problem. Although sweet potato slicing and other processing tools have a certain foundation in some areas, they are far from being able to meet the needs of this year's sweet potato harvest. According to preliminary calculations from six provinces including Hubei, Jiangsu, Shandong, Sichuan, Hebei, and Hunan, more than 300 billion jin of sweet potatoes need to be sliced, while the existing slicing machines can only complete 40 billion jin. Therefore, fully seizing the month before the sweet potato harvest to further improve the tool reform is the central link in doing a good job in current preparation.

    (Reported by this newspaper) The on-site conference on the comprehensive utilization of potato processing in the fourteen northern provinces held by the Ministry of Light Industry in Lulong County, Hebei, concluded on the 19th. Four hundred representatives attended this meeting.
    The representatives successively visited and learned about various on-site demonstrations and explanations of slicing, drying, grinding, leaking vermicelli, spinning powder skin, making wine, extracting alcohol, and making maltose in the Wuxing People's Commune and Chengguan, and visited the county's comprehensive utilization of potato exhibition. At the same time, the meeting also introduced the experiences of Yanjin County, Henan Province in vigorously running the alcohol industry, and Wuzhai County, Shanxi Province in comprehensively utilizing potatoes.
    At this meeting, the representatives further broke down superstitious ideas and liberated their minds. Some representatives originally believed that starch could not be produced without a refined starch factory. After learning about Lulong's grinding experience, they realized that local methods can also produce refined starch and meet export standards. Some representatives, after seeing grinding, leaking powder, extracting alcohol, and making maltose, felt that these small factories do not need steel, do not need complicated machines, and can use local materials. The investment in a small factory is only a few tens of yuan or a few hundred yuan, and it can be built in three or five days, and townships, communes, and teams can all run it, greatly increasing confidence.
    Everyone also realized that only by starting with local methods can it blossom everywhere. For example, the winery筹办 in Weichang County, Hebei, has not been put into production for six months due to its foreign-style, large scale, and untimely supply of equipment and materials; however, the eight small alcohol factories built by Yangwan Township in the county using local methods only took five days. Experience has proved that places that are greedy for largeness and foreignness cannot mobilize the masses and blossom everywhere; places that implement local methods can quickly mobilize the masses.

    发动群众改革工具  利用土法加工制造
    把甘薯收好藏好利用好
    本报讯  农业部9月中旬在河北省定县召开的全国甘薯现场会议，要求各地全力把大量的甘薯收好，藏好，利用好，确保甘薯丰产丰收。
    据到会的河北、山东、河南等十一个省市汇报，今年甘薯种植面积一亿五千万亩，总产量可达七千亿斤，平均亩产鲜薯约四千五百斤左右。估计今年全国薯类总产量可达到九千亿斤，折粮二千二百多亿斤，约占去年全国粮食总产量的60％左右。薯类丰收不仅将增加粮食总产量，提高人民收入水平，而且也对发展轻工业和畜牧业提供了雄厚的物质基础。
    开会期间，有些人认为今年甘薯面积大，产量高，能否全部收回来并且妥善处理还有问题。会议认为，今年收贮甘薯的困难只要采取有效措施，调动一切积极因素，困难是可以克服的。定县就是个很好榜样。今年定县甘薯种植面积七十余万亩，预计总产量八十二亿斤，全县每人平均一万二千六百斤，由于县委及时的作了全面安排和准备，认真解决了收刨甘薯与其他工作的矛盾，计划有二十天即可将全县甘薯收刨完毕。他们提出的口号是：“千军万马齐动员，大收大刨二十天，苦战奋战昼夜干，收获不完不离田”。这给予代表们以极大的鼓舞。
    会议指出，甘薯综合利用的前途很大。据有关单位材料，如果以今年薯类总产量的30％用于制造酒精，可出酒精一千三百五十万吨，能代替五百四十万吨汽油。而且设厂简单，成本也低，人民公社、农业社都可以直接生产。
    会议指出，做好甘薯的收获、贮藏和加工利用的关键是劳动力问题。因此除必须依靠和发动群众，加强劳动组织，统一调配，集中力量，分期突击外，必须大搞工具改革。会议期间各地代表介绍了许多新创造和改装的收刨、加工工具。定县的动力收获机每天可收获三十亩甘薯，双铧犁改装的收刨机效果也很好。辽宁的四马两人犁每天能收十八亩，四川西充县创造的改良犁每天能收四亩，河北天津专区创造的改良犁每天能收获七亩，这些都受到代表们的很大欢迎。但是会议也指出，甘薯收获、加工工具的改革工作还只是个开始，特别是动力机械还为数不多，各地必须大搞畜力工具改革才能解决问题。甘薯切片等加工工具在有些地区虽有一定基础，但也远不能适应今年甘薯丰收的需要。据湖北、江苏、山东、四川、河北、湖南等六个省初步计算，需要进行切片的甘薯有三千多亿斤，而现有切片机的切片能力，仅能完成四百亿斤。因此，充分抓紧收薯前的一个月的时间，进一步做好工具改革工作是做好当前准备工作中的中心环节。
    本报讯  轻工业部在河北卢龙县召开的北方十四省薯类加工综合利用现场会议已在19日结束。参加这次会议的代表有四百人。
    代表们先后在五星人民公社和城关参观了切片、晒干、磨粉、漏粉丝、旋粉皮、制酒、提酒精、制饴糖等各种现场表演和讲解，并参观了该县薯类综合利用展览会。同时，会议上还介绍了河南延津县大办酒精工业、山西五寨县综合利用马铃薯等经验。
    在这次会议上代表们进一步打破了迷信思想，解放了思想。有些代表原来认为没有精制淀粉厂就不能生产出淀粉，学习了卢龙的磨粉经验，才知道土法也能生产精制淀粉，并达到了出口标准。有的代表看了磨粉、漏粉、提酒精、制饴糖后，觉得这些小厂不用钢铁，不要复杂的机器，可以就地取材，花钱少，收效快。一个小工厂的投资只要几十元或几百元，三天五天就能建成，乡、社、队都能办，大大增加了信心。
    大家还认识到只有土法上马，才能遍地开花。如河北围场县筹办的酒厂，由于洋一些大一些，设备和材料供应不及时，六个月还没有投入生产；可是该县阳湾乡用土法建设的八个小型酒精厂，只用了五天时间。经验证明，凡是贪大贪洋的地方都不能很好发动群众，遍地开花；凡是实行土法上马的地方，都能迅速发动群众。

    在这次会上，还初步开展了地区之间的社会主义大协作。
