Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, September 23rd: The new provocative acts of U.S. imperialism have enraged people of all nationalities and all walks of life in Yunnan Province. People unanimously support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and are determined to fully support the struggle to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan.
    At gatherings held separately by the one thousand delegates attending the Third Session of the First Yunnan Provincial Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Zheng Yufa, a Lisu Party delegate from the Gaoligong Mountains west of the Nu River, said that the Lisu people are implementing universal armament to turn the motherland's border into an iron wall to support the struggle to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan. Dao Zhenguo, a Jingpo Party delegate, said that the armed provocations of U.S. imperialism cannot intimidate the Chinese people, and the Jingpo people are determined to unite with the military and civilians at the front to drive the invaders out of the Taiwan Strait. Wei Zhaoxin, First Secretary of the Yangbi County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who has been engaged in military work for a long time, said that more than 15,000 people in Yangbi County have now taken up arms, and once the motherland needs them, they will immediately rush to the battlefield and give the enemy a devastating blow. Dao Jianming, District Head of the Bulang Ethnic Autonomous Region in Xishuangbanna, said that if U.S. imperialism does not get out of Taiwan, then we will completely wipe it out. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Yunnan Provincial Youth Federation, and the Yunnan Provincial Federation of University Students, representing three million young students in Yunnan Province, issued a statement saying that the young students throughout the province will further strengthen military training and respond to the call of the motherland at any time; wherever imperialism invades, we will eliminate it there.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, September 23rd: Yesterday, 800,000 people of all nationalities in Guiyang gathered to support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and denounced Dulles's shameless lies.
    The 310 representatives of all nationalities attending the First Session of the Second Guizhou Provincial People's Congress pointed out that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement represents the common will of the 16 million people of Guizhou Province. The congress passed a resolution calling on the people of all nationalities throughout the province to take immediate action, muster greater revolutionary vigor, increase the production of more steel, machinery, and grain, rapidly realize the people's commune system, and implement universal armament with practical actions to support the liberation of Jinmen and Mazu, liberate Taiwan, and strive to realize the sacred cause of unifying the motherland.
    The workers of Guiyang City expressed great anger at Dulles's lies. Chen Zanyan, a turner at the Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory, said: "Dulles really has a high fever and talks nonsense. Today, the Taiwan issue is not a 'ceasefire' issue, but a question of whether U.S. imperialism will stop setting fires." The employees of the Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant, at gatherings held by the steelmaking furnaces and rolling mills, unanimously expressed their determination to smash Dulles's "ceasefire" lies with practical actions. Rolling mill workers Nie Chengjiu and Ren Tingzhang firmly stated that they would definitely work with all the workers in the workshop to complete the task of rolling 1,200 tons of steel this year five days ahead of schedule.
    All officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Guiyang area, as well as all agencies, schools, people's organizations, and democratic parties in Guiyang City, held gatherings to denounce Dulles's lies.
