    Zhengzhou, September 1st (Our Dispatch) Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and inspired by the comprehensive great leap forward in industry and agriculture, Henan's rural areas have realized the people's commune system. As of the end of August, the province's rural areas, based on the original 38,473 agricultural cooperatives with an average of 260 households per cooperative, have built 1,378 large-scale comprehensive people's communes, with an average of over 7,200 households per commune. Farmer households joining people's communes account for 99.98% of the total number of farmer households in the province. Thus, the work of establishing people's communes throughout the province has basically concluded.

    The path of people's communes in Henan's rural areas is an inevitable trend in the development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, a result of the comprehensive great leap forward in industry and agriculture in the province over the past year, and also an urgent demand of the broad masses. In the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the broad masses have deeply experienced that the relations of production in small cooperatives can no longer adapt to the needs of the large-scale, high-speed comprehensive development of industrial, agricultural production, and other construction endeavors. Therefore, on the basis of merging small cooperatives into large ones, the broad masses universally demanded the establishment of people's communes. In addition, Henan Province has consistently maintained and successfully operated 495 large cooperatives with over a thousand households for several years, which has played a significant role. After the wheat harvest this year, in order to meet the needs of developing production, the work of merging small cooperatives into large ones was relatively common in various regions. In July, after the establishment of the Satellite People's Commune in Suiping County, the work of establishing people's communes was tested and unfolded throughout the province. In early August, Chairman Mao came to Henan to inspect the work, indicating the correct direction of taking the path of people's communes, which greatly encouraged the people of the whole province, and the upsurge of establishing people's communes quickly formed in the rural areas of the whole province.

    The people's communes that have now been established in Henan Province are mostly collectively owned. The products produced by the communes, in addition to ensuring the delivery of public grain, taxes, and the completion of the state's unified procurement tasks, are still independently distributed by each commune. In these people's communes, a considerable portion of the main means of production actually has elements of ownership by the whole people. In addition, there are also a small number of people's communes where all major means of production are owned by the whole people, and the products are allocated and used by the state, with profits, production expenses, and members' consumption all uniformly stipulated by the state. There are also many state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives merged to build people's communes, implementing unified management, separate accounting, and separate remuneration. The wages of the original farm workers remain unchanged, and the members of the original agricultural cooperatives adopt a low-wage system. From the situation of the people's communes established in various places, they generally have the following eight characteristics: First, the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, the integration of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and the comprehensive combination of politics, economics, culture, and military affairs. This is the best grass-roots organizational form of socialism in our country, and it will also be the best grass-roots organizational form for building socialism and transitioning to communism. Second, the scale of the commune changes from small to large, and all have a small town as the political, economic, and cultural center of the commune. Third, the integration of government and commune, the combination of economic organizations and political power organizations. Fourth, the means of production will gradually change from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, further and thoroughly eliminating the remnants of private ownership. Fifth, the commune has a large scale, broad undertakings, many laborers, and high enthusiasm of members, so there has been specialization of production, some have already militarized labor organization, combated production, and disciplined life, and correctly combined specialization and diversification, production and learning. Sixth, the collectivization of commune members' lives and the socialization of family labor. Seventh, the implementation of a wage system, with some communes implementing a supply system for grain. Eighth, it can more widely and fully develop socialist democracy, making the political life of the masses more lively and vigorous.

    The establishment of people's communes has further liberated the productive forces, demonstrating greater superiority than agricultural cooperatives. First, it improves labor efficiency, especially thoroughly liberating women's labor. According to preliminary statistics from seven special districts, after the establishment of public canteens, more than 6.94 million women's labor were freed up to participate in production. At the same time, due to militarized organization, collective living, and combative production, production efficiency is generally about 20% higher than that of agricultural cooperatives. Second, it can expand the public accumulation of communes, rationally use funds, and accelerate the speed of basic construction in industry and agriculture and the realization of agricultural mechanization. Third, it breaks the original production limitations of agricultural cooperatives, can better plant according to local conditions, rationally use land, and fully exploit the potential of the land. Fourth, it can uniformly utilize labor, funds, land, and various natural resources to carry out basic construction, fundamentally overcoming all natural disasters. Fifth, it is more conducive to technological revolution and cultural revolution, promoting the great development of culture and education, cultivating a large number of red and expert activists, and gradually realizing the popularization of education and free medical care in combination with education and productive labor. Now all communes in the province have established agricultural universities and middle schools, and popularized primary school education. Sixth, the commune is the best organizational form for implementing the general line of socialist construction. It can best realize the policy of taking both industry and agriculture, large, medium, and small sizes together, light and heavy industries together, and indigenous and foreign methods together, which is most conducive to embodying the spirit of the whole people running industry and the whole people running all undertakings. According to recent statistics, there are already more than 350,000 commune-run factories (farms) in the province, and many communes have also established power stations, steel plants, and machine repair shops, which can build socialism at a higher speed. Seventh, due to the continuous growth of communist factors in the commune, it is conducive to gradually eliminating the differences between cities and villages, industry and agriculture, and mental and physical labor. Eighth, it raises the socialist and communist ideological consciousness of the people and establishes communist moral qualities.

    In the process of establishing people's communes, various regions in Henan have closely combined it with current production. In the 20 days of establishing communes in Xinxiang Special District, more than 40,000 new factories of various types such as iron smelting and machinery were built, more than twice as many as before the people's communeization of the entire district. The original 300 or so small cooperatives in Xinxiang Special District made very slow progress in tool reform before the establishment of people's communes; once the large-scale people's commune was established, the tool reform movement developed rapidly, and more than 80% of the five main tools such as close planting drills, water lifting tools, deep plows, and carts were reformed, and semi-mechanization can be realized by the end of August. In the establishment of communes, all regions have further strengthened the management of autumn fields to strive for a greater harvest in the autumn.

    In the movement to establish people's communes, the CPC organizations at all levels in Henan Province resolutely stood at the forefront of the movement, resolutely relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, relied on the majority of the masses, and actively led the masses to take the path of people's communeization, thereby ensuring the healthy development of the movement. At the beginning of the movement, various places universally launched a great liberation of thought, a great contending and blooming, and a great debate on topics such as "Is it necessary to establish people's communes?" "What are the advantages of people's communes?" "How to establish people's communes?" "Who to rely on to establish people's communes?", unfolded the struggle between two roads and two ideologies, raised the awareness of the broad masses, and also carried out struggles against destructive behaviors. After the debate, the enthusiasm of the masses soared unprecedentedly, and they wrote letters of determination and big-character posters demanding the establishment of people's communes.

    At present, various places are carrying out the consolidation work of the people's communes, further implementing the class line and the mass line, ensuring that the poor and lower-middle peasants occupy an absolute advantage in the leadership of the people's communes, and strengthening the leadership of the current production and operation management work of the people's communes, so that the people's communes can quickly get on the right track and leap forward in various tasks.

    数千万农民坚定地向共产主义过渡
　　河南农村实现人民公社化
　　人民公社显示出比农业社有更大的优越性
    更加提高劳动效率　扩大公共积累　打破生产局限性
    便于加强统一规划　便于技术革命和文化革命
    全民办一切事业　逐步消灭城乡差别　树立共产主义思想
    本报郑州1日电　在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业全面大跃进的鼓舞下，河南农村已经实现了人民公社化。截至8月底，全省农村在原有三万八千四百七十三个农业社、平均每社二百六十户的基础上，已经建成大型的综合性的人民公社一千三百七十八个，平均每社七千二百多户。加入人民公社的农户已占全省农户总数99.98％。至此，全省建立人民公社的工作已告基本结束。
    河南省农村走人民公社的道路，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设形势发展的必然趋势，是全省一年来工农业全面大跃进的结果，也是广大人民群众的迫切要求。在工业、农业生产大跃进中，广大群众已经深深体验到小社的生产关系已经不能适应大规模的、高速度的工业、农业生产和其他建设事业全面发展的需要。因此，广大群众在小社并大社的基础上，普遍要求建立人民公社。此外，河南省几年来一直坚持和办好了四百九十五个千户以上的大社，起了很大的作用。今年麦收以后，各地为适应发展生产的需要，又比较普遍地进行小社并大社工作。7月间，遂平县卫星人民公社建立后，办人民公社的工作就在全省各地试验和展开。8月上旬，毛主席来河南视察工作，指示了走人民公社的正确方向，对全省人民鼓舞很大，办人民公社就迅速在全省农村中形成高潮。
    现在河南省已建成的人民公社，绝大部分是集体所有制。公社生产的产品除了保证交售公粮、税款和完成国家统购物资的任务以外，仍由各公社独立分配。在这些人民公社里，实际上有相当一部分主要生产资料已带有全民所有的成分。此外还有一小部分人民公社，一切主要生产资料归全民所有，产品由国家调拨使用，上交利润、生产开支、社员消费都由国家统一规定。也有不少国营农场和农业社合并建成人民公社，实行统一经营、分别核算、分别计酬，原农场工人工资不动，原农业社社员采取低工资制的办法。从各地建立的人民公社的情况来看，一般都具有如下八个特点：一，农、林、牧、副、渔业全面发展，工、农、商、学、兵五位一体，政治、经济、文化、军事全面结合，这是我国社会主义的最好的基层组织形式，也将是建成社会主义和向共产主义过渡的最好的基层组织形式。二，社的规模由小变大，并且都有一个小城镇作为公社的政治、经济、文化中心。三，政社合一，经济组织与政权组织合一。四，生产资料将逐步地由集体所有制变成全民所有制，进一步彻底消灭私有制的残余。五，公社规模大、事业广、劳力多、社员热情高，因此出现了生产专业化，有的已经劳动组织军事化，生产战斗化，生活纪律化，并且把专业化和多面化、生产和学习正确地结合起来。六，社员生活集体化、家庭劳动社会化。七，实行工资制，部分公社粮食实行供给制。八，更能广泛地充分地发挥社会主义民主，使群众的政治生活更加生动活泼。
    人民公社的建立，进一步解放了生产力，显示出比农业社更大的优越性。第一，提高劳动效率，特别使妇女劳动力得到了彻底解放。据七个专区的初步统计，举办了公共食堂以后，使六百九十四万多个妇女劳动力腾出手来参加了生产。同时由于组织军事化，生活集体化，生产战斗化，在生产效率上一般比农业社提高20％左右。第二，可以扩大公社的公共积累，合理使用资金，加速工、农业的基本建设和实现农业机械化的速度。第三，打破了原来农业社的生产局限性，可以更好地因地种植，合理使用土地，充分发挥土地潜力。第四，可以统一利用劳力、资金、土地和各种自然资源，进行基本建设，从根本上战胜一切自然灾害。第五，更便于技术革命和文化革命，促进文化和教育事业大发展，大量培养又红又专的积极分子队伍，在教育与生产劳动结合下逐步实现教育普及化，医疗公费化。现在全省所有公社都建立了农业大学、中学，并普及了小学教育。第六，公社是贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线的最好的组织形式，它能最好地实现工、农业并举，大、中、小型并举，轻、重工业并举，土洋并举等建设社会主义的方针，最有利于体现全民办工业、全民办一切事业的精神。据最近统计，全省社办工厂（场）已达三十五万多个，不少社还建立了发电站、钢铁厂、机器修配厂，这就可以更高速度地建设社会主义。第七，由于公社共产主义因素的不断增长，有利于逐步消灭城市和农村、工业与农业、脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别。第八，提高人民群众的社会主义和共产主义的思想觉悟，树立共产主义的道德品质。
    河南各地在建立人民公社的过程中，都密切结合了当前生产。新乡专区在建社期间的二十天内，新建炼铁、机械等各种工厂四万多个，超过了全区人民公社化以前两倍多。新乡专区原有三百个左右的小社，在未成立人民公社以前，工具改革进展十分迟缓；大型的人民公社一建立，工具改革运动飞跃发展，密植耧、提水工具、深耕犁、车子等五种主要工具改革了80％以上，8月底可以实现半机械化。各地在建社中，都进一步加强了秋田管理，争取秋季更大丰收。
    在建立人民公社运动中，中共河南省各级组织坚决地站在运动的前列，坚决依靠贫农、下中农、依靠群众大多数，积极领导群众走人民公社化的道路，从而保证了运动的健康发展。运动一开始，各地普遍展开了“要不要建立人民公社？”“人民公社有什么优越性？”“怎样建立人民公社？”“依靠谁建立人民公社？”等题目的大放大鸣大辩论，展开了两条道路、两种思想的斗争，提高了广大群众的觉悟，并且向破坏行为进行了斗争。经过辩论，群众的情绪空前高涨，纷纷写决心书、大字报要求建立人民公社。
    目前，各地都在进行人民公社的巩固工作，进一步贯彻阶级路线和群众路线，保证贫农和下中农在人民公社的领导中占绝对优势，并加强对当前人民公社生产和经营管理工作的领导，使人民公社迅速地走上轨道，并在各项工作中飞跃前进。
