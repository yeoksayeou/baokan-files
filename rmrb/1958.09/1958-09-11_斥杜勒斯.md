Denouncing Dulles
Wei Wei

Dulles—this little lapdog of American monopoly capital—is threatening us again. In the past, we have seen such little lapdogs at the feet of the wealthy. It runs back and forth with bells jingling, sometimes suddenly turning its head, barking a few times, baring its teeth to scare people. Despite its pitiful appearance, as long as you don't raise your foot, it will yelp, showing off an air of invincibility. As the saying goes, "A dog's mouth can't produce ivory." Since the day we heard his great name, no one expected to hear anything good from his mouth. But he is becoming more and more shameless every day!

He actually said that Jinmen and Mazu, our own land right under our noses, "have never been under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Communists," and that the Chinese people's attempt to liberate them is "seizing new territory," thus requiring the dispatch of American armed forces to "ensure" and "protect." Isn't this the argument of a naked aggressor! This is something only Dulles and Eisenhower have the face to say. Moreover, it's the same old "rogue philosophy" of Koreans invading Korea, Vietnamese invading Vietnam, Lebanese invading Lebanon, and Iraqis invading Iraq!

You say that Jinmen and Mazu "have never been under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Communists," but even the entire mainland of China was not under the "jurisdiction" of the Chinese Communist Party and the people of the whole country in the past. It was all under the "jurisdiction" of the "Republic of China" and your "President Chiang" that you want to "protect." But why didn't they continue to "govern"? Who told them to flee to the sea in dismay? They insisted on going, what can people do! This can only be left to the Communist Party and the people to "govern." If someone were to establish a "principle" that whoever governed originally should continue to govern, then China was originally governed by Cao Kun, Wu Peifu, Sun Chuanfang, and Zhang Zuolin. Going further back, the three-year-old Puyi also governed, and even further back, Qin Shi Huang also governed. May I ask, "who" seized "whose" "new territory"? Let's talk about you Westerners: Louis XVI governed France, the Tsar governed Russia, Hitler governed Germany, and later governed most of Europe. Should we invite them back to govern? But they don't want to come back because they have suffered enough punishment from the people and have now ascended to heaven to enjoy blessings in their "kingdom." Mr. Dulles, who is so concerned about the "jurisdiction" issue, may I ask you: how do you solve these "jurisdiction" problems?

Taking a step back, Jinmen and Mazu "have never been under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Communists," but were Jinmen and Mazu "ever" under the jurisdiction of the United States? Are they under the jurisdiction of you, Dulles and Eisenhower? Why are you shamelessly interfering? What qualifications do you have to interfere in this jurisdiction issue? The Chinese people liberating their own islands is called "seizing new territory," the people of Iraq and Lebanon solving their own internal affairs is called "aggression," while you cross the ocean and send troops to other people's territory, calling it "defense" and "protection"! Is there anyone more shameless than this in the world? This is Dulles—the outstanding figure of the "free world" and the "civilized world"!

In his "statement," Dulles also threatened us, saying that he would send troops to occupy Jinmen and Mazu. If we resist, he will expand the offensive to a larger scope, even "taking other measures he deems necessary or appropriate to ensure the defense of Formosa." We advise Dulles: if you want to scare people, go somewhere else, don't try this trick in front of the Chinese. Because the troops of the "Republic of China" that you support, we have already used "necessary or appropriate other measures" to arrange them in "appropriate" places. As for your American soldiers, everyone met in Korea. Sending them to Jinmen and Mazu again is nothing more than another face-to-face encounter. What's so great about it! I'm not boasting for the People's Liberation Army here, but if your US-Chiang allied forces come with one or two million, it would really require you to make some preparations, but for the People's Liberation Army, I'm afraid it wouldn't be enough to satisfy their appetite. As for your "other measures," at most it's nothing more than dropping atomic bombs. In fact, you have said this a long time ago. In the past, you were the only one who had them, so you could really boast about it. Now, other places have them too, and they run farther and hit more accurately than your atomic bombs and missiles. If you recite that same scripture again, it won't work, and it will seem a bit foolish.

Mr. Dulles! We once again warn you: your little lapdog-like barking will never scare the Chinese! We love peace, but we are not afraid of war. Because we have seen war, and the Chinese people have come through a series of wars and won a series of victories. For us, war only means some sacrifices and losses, but for you, for the imperialist system, it is a clean and final end! Dulles! Please dig your grave, our people, our soldiers, our friends will responsibly send you to meet Hitler, please go there to give your warmongering speeches!

As I finish writing this short article, I would also like to pay tribute to the soldiers on the front lines of coastal defense, to our heroic artillerymen, and to our pilots and naval commanders and fighters. You are at the forefront of the glorious struggle. The people of the whole country and the people of the world are watching you. I hope you will achieve greater victories. The people believe: Jinmen and Mazu will surely return to the motherland's hands! Taiwan and Penghu will surely return to the motherland's hands!

    斥杜勒斯
    魏巍
    杜勒斯——这个美国垄断资本的小哈巴狗，又在恫吓我们了。过去，在阔佬们的脚下，我们都见过这样的小哈巴狗。它带着响铃，跑前跑后，有时忽然转过头来，吠几声，呲着牙齿，吓人们一下。尽管它的样子，可怜得很，只要你没有举起脚来，它就狺狺然，全显出一副不可一世的怪样。俗语云：“狗嘴里吐不出象牙。”自从我们听说他的大名那一天起，没有谁指望从他的嘴里听出什么好话。可是，他竟一天比一天的无耻！
    他竟说，我们鼻子尖下的自己的土地——金门、马祖，“从来没有处于中国共产党人的管辖之下”，中国人民要去解放它是“夺取新的领土”，因而需要派出美国的武装部队来“确保”和“保护”。——这不是赤裸裸的侵略者的论调吗！这是只有杜勒斯、艾森豪威尔才有脸说出来的。而且，还是朝鲜人侵略朝鲜，越南人侵略越南，黎巴嫩人侵略黎巴嫩，伊拉克人侵略伊拉克那一套“流氓哲学”！
    你们说，金门、马祖，“过去从来没有处于中国共产党人管辖之下”，可是，连中国整个大陆，过去也没有在中国共产党和全国人民的“管辖”之下呀，都是在你要“保护”的“中华民国”和你的“蒋总统”的管辖之下呀，可是他们为什么不继续“管辖”下去呢？谁要他们丧魂失魄地逃到大海里去呢？他们硬要去，这叫人有什么办法呢！这只有让共产党和人民来“管辖”了。如果谁来确定一个“原则”，原来谁管辖还要归谁管辖的话，那末，中国原来是归曹锟、吴佩孚、孙传芳、张作霖管辖，再上去，三岁的溥仪也管辖过，再上上上去，秦始皇也管辖过，请问，是“谁”夺了“谁”的“新的领土”呢？就说你们西方：路易十六管辖过法国，沙皇管辖过俄国，希特勒管辖过德国，以后又管辖了大半个欧洲，那就该还请他们回来管辖了。可是他们并不愿回来，因为他们受够了人民的惩罚，现在升了天，到他们的“天国”里享清福去了。对“管辖”问题如此关切的杜勒斯先生，请问你：如何来解决这些“管辖”问题呢？
    退一步说，金门、马祖，“过去从来没有处于中国共产党人的管辖之下”，可是，金门、马祖，“过去”“从来”是处于美国的管辖之下吗？是处于你杜勒斯、艾森豪威尔的管辖之下吗？你为什么不要脸搀进来打混混呢？你有什么资格来干涉这个管辖问题？中国人民解放自己的岛屿，叫“夺取新的领土”，伊拉克、黎巴嫩人民解决自己的内政问题，叫做“侵略”，而你们远渡重洋，把兵开到别人的领土上去，倒名之曰“保卫”、“保护”！人世间还有比这更甚的无耻之徒吗？这就是杜勒斯——这个“自由世界”、“文明世界”出类拔萃人物的行状！
    杜勒斯在“声明”里，还恐吓我们，说他要出兵占领金门、马祖。如果我们抵抗的话，他就会把进攻扩大到更大的范围，甚至“采取他认为是保证保卫福摩萨所必需或适当的其他措施”。我们劝杜勒斯：你要吓人，还是到别的地方去，别在中国人的面前来这一套。因为你所支持的“中华民国”的军队，我们早已用“必需或适当的其他措施”，把他们安排到“适当”的地方去了；至于你的美国兵，大家在朝鲜也见过面。你把他们再派到金门、马祖，无非再来个面对面。有什么了不起呢！我这里不是给人民解放军夸口，你那美蒋联军来一、二百万，对于你倒着实需要张罗一番，但对于解放军，恐怕还不一定能满足他们的胃口。至于你的“其他措施”，顶多无非是丢原子弹。其实，这话你早就说过的。过去是“只此一家，别无分店”，你倒可以着实夸口一番。现在，别处也有了，而且比你的原子弹、导弹还跑得远、打得准，你再照样念那本经，就不灵了，也未免有点蠢相。
    杜勒斯先生！我们再一次地警告你：你那小哈巴狗式的吠声，是决吓不倒中国人的！我们热爱和平，但决不惧怕战争。因为我们并不是没有见过战争，中国人民正是从一连串的战争中走过来，并且获得了一连串的胜利。战争对于我们，只不过遭一些牺牲和损失，而对于你，对于帝国主义制度，却是干脆、最后的完蛋！杜勒斯！请你掘好墓坑吧，我们的人民，我们的战士，我们的朋友，会把你负责地送到希特勒那里去和他会面的，请你到那里去发表好战演说吧！
    在这篇短文写完的时候，我还要向海防前线的战士们致敬，向我们英勇的炮手致敬，向我们的飞行员、舰艇指战员致敬。你们正处在光荣斗争的第一线。全国人民、全世界人民正在注视着你们。希望你们获得更大的胜利。人民相信：金门、马祖必归祖国之手！台湾、澎湖必归祖国之手！
