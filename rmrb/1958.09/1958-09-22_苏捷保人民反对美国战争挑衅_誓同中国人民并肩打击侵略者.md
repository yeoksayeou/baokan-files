    This newspaper provides comprehensive coverage: According to Xinhua News Agency: The people of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and other countries have launched a massive wave of protest against the United States' war provocations in the Taiwan Strait region, and resolutely support the just struggle of the Chinese people.
    Soviet Union
    Since the U.S. imperialists created tensions in the Taiwan Strait region, working people throughout the Soviet Union have written letters to the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, angrily protesting the U.S. imperialists' military provocations and threats of war against China.
    Workers from the Moscow Mechanical Manufacturing Plant sent representatives to the Chinese Embassy to deliver their resolution protesting U.S. provocative actions. In the resolution, all the workers of the factory stated that in the struggle against U.S. aggression, the Soviet people would provide the Chinese people with all possible assistance.
    Soviet veterans, Captain Aleksandrov and Lieutenant Voltshev, jointly wrote a letter to the Chinese Embassy, expressing their willingness to fight alongside the Chinese People's Liberation Army for the liberation of Taiwan and other Chinese islands.
    Volobyov, a miner from Lugansk, Ukrainian Republic, requested in a letter to the Chinese Embassy to convey to all the Chinese people that he is ready at any moment to deliver a head-on blow to anyone who dares to infringe upon the Chinese people.
    Kiev citizen Kostyuk wrote to the Chinese Embassy on behalf of his entire family, saying that his whole family is heartily pleased with every new achievement the Chinese people have gained in construction. He and his family are also pleased that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, vigilantly guarding the fruits of the revolution, is giving the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang the punishment it deserves.
    Czechoslovakia
    A massive wave of protests against the United States' provocations in the Taiwan Strait region has been launched throughout Czechoslovakia. Factories, mines, government offices, schools, and rural areas have held rallies to express their indignation at the actions of the atomic blackmailers and to express their complete solidarity with the Chinese people who are defending a just cause. A demonstration of 30,000 people was held in Namest, Moravia, to protest U.S. aggression in the Taiwan region.
    Working people from all over the country sent hundreds of telegrams to the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Chinese Embassy in Czechoslovakia, and the editorial department of "Red Right News." They stated in the telegrams that they would support the struggle of the Chinese people with practical actions. Workers in machinery factories that are producing orders for China have decided to shorten the delivery time for China. The workers of the Dukla Kade factory guaranteed in a telegram to the Chinese Embassy in Prague that they would deliver three boilers to China two weeks ahead of schedule.
    Soldiers of the Sapototsky Military Academy in Brno and responsible persons of various Party organizations of the Ministry of National Defense expressed in telegrams their solidarity with the Chinese people, and also expressed their determination to fulfill their internationalist obligations when necessary.
    Gusta Fuchikova, the wife of the Czechoslovak national hero Julius Fucik, condemned the U.S. imperialist aggressive and provocative actions against China in a report at the Fourth Congress of the Czechoslovak Committee for the Defense of Peace on the 20th. She said that Taiwan and the coastal islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times and have nothing to do with the United States. The peace defenders of Czechoslovakia resolutely condemn the piratical adventurous actions of the U.S. imperialists and fully support the statement of the Czechoslovak government against U.S. aggression against China.
    Bulgaria
    Mass rallies continue to be held throughout Bulgaria, angrily protesting the United States' shameless aggressive provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait. From September 14 to 5:15 p.m. on September 18, the Chinese Embassy in Bulgaria received more than 900 telegrams and documents addressed to the Chinese Embassy passed by protest rallies throughout Bulgaria.
    In these letters and telegrams, the Bulgarian working people resolutely stated: If the U.S. aggressors dare to provoke a war, they will, together with peace-loving people all over the world, thoroughly eliminate the aggressors side by side with their Chinese brothers.
    Thousands of Bulgarian writers, journalists, actors, composers, and painters held a protest rally in Sofia on the 19th, angrily condemning the U.S. military provocations and war threats against China in the Taiwan Strait region.
