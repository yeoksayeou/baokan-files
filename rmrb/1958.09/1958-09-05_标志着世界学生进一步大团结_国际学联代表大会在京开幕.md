    Pang Chunlan, a student from Peking University, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress on behalf of the students of the capital, Beijing. She said, "The students of Beijing, like the students of the whole country, eagerly hope to live with students all over the world in a peaceful world where all nations are equal and live in friendship.

We are willing to establish and develop friendly exchanges with students from all countries in the world."

    Liu Xiyuan, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, delivered a welcome speech at the congress. He expressed a warm welcome to the student representatives from all over the world, saying that the holding of this congress in our capital, Beijing, brings us joy and encouragement.

    Then, hundreds of Young Pioneers wearing red scarves and holding high the flags of the Young Pioneers marched into the venue in two rows. They presented bouquets of flowers to the ISU President and members of the Secretariat and scattered basket after basket of petals to the student representatives from various countries. At this time, the entire venue stood up and applauded thunderously.
