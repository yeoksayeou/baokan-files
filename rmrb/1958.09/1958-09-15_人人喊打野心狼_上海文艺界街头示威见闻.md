Everyone Shouts and Beats the Ambition Wolf
——Scenes from Street Demonstrations by Shanghai’s Literary and Art Circles
By our Shanghai Correspondent

    Yesterday – Sunday in Shanghai was engulfed in a surging tide of anger against American imperialist aggression. From dawn till night, from bustling city centers to quiet lanes, angry roars shook every corner. Two hundred and fifty thousand literary and art workers, along with amateur art troupes from factories, government offices, schools, and neighborhoods throughout the city, took to the streets to launch large-scale demonstrations against the American aggressors' military provocations and threats of war.

    Now is not the time for "Put Down Your Whip"!

    Zhang Ruifang, Cui Wei, and others, actors who starred in the sensationally popular anti-Japanese national salvation street play "Put Down Your Whip" twenty-two years ago, appeared again on the streets of Shanghai's western district yesterday, performing a living newspaper drama "The End of the War Maniac." Cui Wei beat the gong furiously, and the flames of the people's anger against American imperialist armed provocations burned even higher under the stage. When the living newspaper drama reached its climax, with the American handful of warmongers and the running dog Chiang Kai-shek being trampled underfoot by the heroic Chinese people, the performers and the audience together raised their arms and shouted slogans: "American imperialism, get out of Taiwan!" Zhang Ruifang excitedly told reporters that twenty years ago, we participated in the national salvation movement with grief and indignation. Today, twenty years later, the victorious Chinese people are unprecedentedly strong. If American imperialism dares to expand its aggression, let it be completely destroyed.

    Zheng Junli, Zhao Dan, and Han Tao, literary and art workers who participated in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement in those years, all gave up their rest and meal times yesterday to participate passionately in the ranks of the demonstrations. They warned the aggressors: Today is no longer an era of imperialist tyranny!

    "Living Wu Song" Angrily Beats the "Paper Tiger"

    On a street stage in Jiangning District, an old man with white hair but vigorous spirit appeared. People immediately recognized him as the famous Peking opera artist Gai Jiaotian, whom they were very familiar with. This old artist, who is particularly good at playing the tiger-fighting hero Wu Song and has earned the title of "Living Wu Song," once again performed his signature tiger-fighting scene on the street yesterday, with the American paper tiger, outwardly strong but inwardly weak and brutally cruel by nature, being the one he fiercely beat.

    The shameless behavior of American imperialism in constantly carrying out military provocations against our country has deeply angered the 73-year-old Gai Jiaotian. The day before yesterday, he designed a martial drama called "American Wolves Get Out of Taiwan." Despite feeling unwell, he insisted on rehearsing with the actors of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theater, and he performed it on the street early yesterday morning.

    Zhou Xinfang, the famous Peking opera artist and director of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theater, who had just returned to Shanghai from a tour performance in various places, took to the streets with the opera theater's demonstration team, demonstrating and singing.

    Blood Debts Must Be Paid in Blood!

    Yuan Xuefen, Fan Ruijuan, and Lü Ruiying, famous Yue opera actors who had recently returned from the Fujian front lines, performed a true story from the Fujian front lines on the streets of Jiangning District yesterday: "Blood Debts Must Be Paid in Blood!" When they performed the scene of a kind mother and child being bombed to death by the brutal American-Chiang airplanes, and the People's Liberation Army soldiers who rushed to rescue them holding up the dead child and swearing an oath, thousands of spectators under the stage roared: "Avenge the martyred comrades!" "We must liberate Taiwan!" The shouts were earth-shattering and soared into the sky.

    When Yuan Xuefen and others performed in Fujian, they traveled to towns and islands along the coastal defense front lines, witnessing firsthand the unrest caused to the people on the front lines by the Chiang bandit troops. Enemy shells often flew over their heads, which infuriated them. After returning to Shanghai, they immediately worked day and night to create living newspaper dramas against American aggression, demanding the establishment of a military cultural troupe, ready to listen to the call of the motherland at any time.

    Everyone Shouts and Beats the Ambition Wolf

    The famous writers Ba Jin, Jin Yi, and others walked at the front of the demonstration ranks. Wherever the procession went, poetry leaflets were posted. The Shanghai Writers Association printed 80,000 copies of combat poems yesterday, expressing opposition to the expansion of aggression by American imperialism and determination to liberate Taiwan.

    The peep show is here! Thirty one-meter-long colored peep show slides attracted the masses in Luwan District. These peep show slides, painted by artists from the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House, irrefutably pointed out that Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times, described the painful life of the Taiwanese people, and expressed the painters' anger towards American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and its recent military provocations.

    More than 300 teachers and students from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, who are participating in labor training in Sanlin Township, Shanghai County, performed for the peasants in the fields in the form of singing and opera. In the past four or five days, they have created 250 songs such as "Talking About Dulles" (performance singing) and "Liberate Taiwan War Song." The famous singers Zhou Xiaoyan, Cai Shaoxu, Gao Zhilan, and Ju Xiufang not only sang themselves, but also taught many popular songs to the peasant masses.

    Mass cultural workers were the largest literary and art demonstration force yesterday. Thousands upon thousands of stages appeared on the streets of the city. Workers and students in costumes performed countless living newspaper dramas. More than 250 workers from the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory wrote, rehearsed, and performed while they worked, expressing their greatest hatred for the American aggressors.

    At night, demonstration crowds could be seen everywhere still roaring in anger. On stage and off, everyone was shouting and beating the ambition wolf!

    人人喊打野心狼
    ——上海文艺界街头示威见闻
    本报驻上海记者
    昨天——星期日的上海处在反对美帝侵略的汹涌澎湃的怒潮中。从清晨到夜晚，从闹市到僻巷，愤怒的吼声震动了每一个角落。全市二十五万文艺工作者和工厂、机关、学校、里弄群众业余文艺队伍走上街头，展开了大规模的反对美国侵略者军事挑衅和战争威胁的示威活动。
    现在不是“放下你的鞭子”的时代了！
    二十二年前，演出轰动一时的抗日救亡街头剧“放下你的鞭子”的演员张瑞芳、崔嵬等，昨天又出现在上海西区的街头，演出了一场活报剧“战争狂人的下场”。崔嵬愤怒地敲起锣鼓，台下人们反对美帝武装挑衅的怒火越燃越高。活报剧演到最后，当美国那一小撮战争贩子和走狗蒋介石被英勇的中国人民踩在脚下的时候，台上台下一起举臂高呼口号：“美帝国主义滚出台湾去！”张瑞芳激动地对记者说，二十年前，我们怀着悲愤的心情参加救亡运动，二十年后的今天，胜利了的中国人民已经空前强大，如果美帝国主义敢于扩大侵略，就叫它彻底灭亡。
    当年参加抗日救亡运动的文艺工作者郑君里、赵丹、韩涛人，昨天都放弃了休息和吃饭的时间，激愤地参加了示威的行列。他们警告侵略者：今天再也不是帝国主义者横行霸道的时代了！
    “活武松”怒打“纸老虎”
    在江宁区的一个街头舞台上，出现了一位头发斑白而精神矍铄的老人，人们马上认出这就是他们非常熟悉的著名京剧艺术家盖叫天。这位特别善演打虎英雄武松而获得“活武松”称号的老艺术家，昨天在街上又一次地演出了打虎的拿手好戏，被他痛打的是这只外强中干、残暴成性的美国纸老虎。
    美帝国主义不断对我国进行军事挑衅的无耻行为，深深激怒了七十三岁高龄的老人盖叫天。他在前天晚上设计出一出武剧“美国狼滚出台湾去”。虽然身体不适，他还是坚持和上海京剧院的演员们一道排练，昨天一早就在街头演出了。
    刚从各地巡回演出回到上海的著名京剧艺术家、上海京剧院院长周信芳和京剧院的示威队伍一起走上街头，一面示威，一面演唱。
    血债要用血来还！
    不久前从福建前线归来的著名越剧演员袁雪芬、范瑞娟、吕瑞英，昨天在江宁区街头演出了一个福建前线的真实故事：“血债要用血来还！”当她们演到善良的母亲和孩子，被残暴成性的美蒋飞机炸死，赶来援救的人民解放军抱起死去的孩子宣誓时，台下数千观众怒吼起来：“为死难同志报仇！”“一定要解放台湾！”呼声震天动地，直冲云霄。
    袁雪芬等人在福建演出时，走遍了海防前线的市镇和海岛，目睹前线人民被蒋匪军骚扰得不得安宁，敌人的炮弹经常从他们的头上飞过，她们愤怒极了。回到上海以后，立即夜以继日地编排反对美国侵略的活报剧，要求成立部队文工团，随时准备着听从祖国的召唤。
    人人喊打野心狼
    巴金、靳以等著名作家走在示威行列的前面。队伍到那里，诗传单就贴到那里。上海作家协会昨天印刷了八万份反对美帝国主义扩大侵略、表示解放台湾决心的战斗诗篇。
    拉洋片的来了！三十幅一公尺长的彩色洋片吸引住了卢湾区的群众。上海人民美术出版社的画家们绘制的这些洋片，无可辩驳地指出了台湾自古以来就是中国的领土，描述了目前台湾人民的痛苦生活，也道出了画家们对美帝国主义侵略台湾和最近的事军挑衅的愤怒心情。
    正在上海县三林乡参加劳动锻炼的上海音乐学院三百多师生，以歌唱、歌剧等形式在田头为农民演出。最近四、五天，他们已创作了“说杜勒斯”（表演唱）、“解放台湾战歌”等歌曲二百五十首。著名的歌唱家周小燕、蔡绍序、高芝兰、鞠秀芳，不仅自己唱，还把许多流行歌曲教给农民群众。
    群众文艺工作者是昨天最大的文艺示威队伍。全市街头出现了成千上万的舞台。化装了的工人和学生演出了无数的活报剧。江南造船厂二百五十多个工人边写、边排、边演，表达对美国侵略者的最大仇恨。
    夜晚，到处可见示威人群还在怒吼。台上台下，人人喊打野心狼！
