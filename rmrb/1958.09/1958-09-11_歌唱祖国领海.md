    Singing the praises of the motherland's territorial waters,
    From now on, clearly defined,
    Twelve nautical miles as the boundary,
    The people applaud in unison.
    From the coconut groves to the cherry blossom shores,
    We are free and at ease,
    We can fish with peace of mind...,
    We can prevent bandits and eliminate disasters.
    At night, the sound of the waves surges,
    Children sleep soundly in their mother's arms,
    The motherland's yachts set out,
    Heroes feel the cool breeze on their faces.

    歌唱祖国领海
    俯拾
    歌唱祖国领海，
    从此明确划开，
    十二海里为界，
    人民同声喝采。
    从椰林到樱花水涯，
    我们自由自在，
    可以放心打鱼……，
    可以防贼消灾。
    夜晚浪声澎湃，
    儿童酣睡母怀，
    祖国的游艇出动，
    英雄们凉风拂腮。
