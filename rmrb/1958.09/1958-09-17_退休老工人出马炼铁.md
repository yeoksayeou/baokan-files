    Retired Old Worker Takes Charge of Iron Smelting
    Recently, a new iron smelting plant appeared in Xiaojiazhuang, Gongsheng Street, Zhangdian District, Zibo City, Shandong Province. The iron smelting workers in this plant are a seventy-year-old man, Zhao Risheng, and a housewife. They are working hard every day to increase pig iron production for the country.
    Zhao Risheng is a retired railway worker. After the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year, he was extremely excited and determined to contribute to the completion of this glorious task. So, he organized thirty or forty housewives and built two furnaces with his own hands to start iron smelting production.
    Zhao Risheng is old but his heart is not, and his enthusiasm is no less than that of a young lad. From morning till night, he is busy by the furnace. Sometimes loading materials, sometimes smashing ore, sometimes mixing coke. He also taught these iron smelting techniques to the women. These two furnaces produced 950 jin of iron on their first run.

    退休老工人出马炼铁
    最近，山东省淄博市张店区工盛街小贾庄新出现了一个炼铁厂。这个厂的炼铁工人是一个七十多岁的老汉赵日盛和一个家庭妇女。他们每天都在为国家增产生铁而努力工作。
    赵日盛是个退休铁路工人。当中共中央政治局扩大会议发出今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的号召以后，他兴奋得不得了，决心要为完成这项光荣任务贡献一份力量。于是他组织了三、四十名家庭妇女，自己动手建成两座炉子，搞起炼铁生产来。
    赵日盛年老心不老，干劲不亚于青年小伙子。每天从早到晚，他都在炉旁边忙碌着。一会装料，一会砸矿石，一会配焦炭。他还把这些炼铁技术教给妇女们。这两座炉子，第一次就出铁九百五十斤。
