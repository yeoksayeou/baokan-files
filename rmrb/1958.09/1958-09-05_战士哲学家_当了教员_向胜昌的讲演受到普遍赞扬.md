Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 4th: Xiang Shengchang, a soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, known as the "Warrior Philosopher," has been hired as a philosophy teacher at the Red and Expert University of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army.

This PLA sergeant recently completed his first lesson preparation next to his anti-aircraft machine gun. The topic of his first lecture was: Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction." In the classroom, Xiang Shengchang used the method of linking theory with practice to expound some basic philosophical principles in "On Contradiction," and used dialectics to vividly and concretely analyze the work of his company, analyze the main contradictions in the company's current progress, and find solutions. This young soldier, who had been herding cattle for landlords since he was eight years old and is now only twenty years old, also used his own experience to analyze the profound class contradictions of old China. His first lesson greatly inspired the officers and broke their mysterious view of philosophy. Xiang Shengchang has become one of the most popular teachers at this Red and Expert University.

Now, Xiang Shengchang has been invited to Kunming to give a series of philosophy lectures. The first audience included propaganda cadres at all levels in Yunnan Province, teachers from Party schools at all levels of the CPC, editors-in-chief of various newspapers, and professors from Yunnan University, Kunming Normal College, and Kunming Institute of Technology. His lectures aroused great interest among the audience. Veteran cadres who have been engaged in theoretical work for many years and gray-haired old professors nodded in praise of the soldier's simple and profound lectures.

　　“战士哲学家”当了教员
    向胜昌的讲演受到普遍赞扬
    据新华社昆明4日电　被誉为“战士哲学家”的解放军某部战士向胜昌，已受聘担任解放军某部红专大学的哲学教员。
    这位解放军中士不久前在他的高射机枪旁完成了第一次备课工作。第一次讲课的题目是：毛主席的“矛盾论”。在课堂上，向胜昌运用理论联系实际的方法阐述了“矛盾论”中的一些基本的哲学原理，并且运用辩证法，生动具体地解剖了他所在连队的工作，分析了这个连队当前前进中的主要矛盾，找出了解决的办法。这位从八岁起就给地主放牛、现在才二十岁的青年士兵，还现身说法分析了旧中国深刻的阶级矛盾。他的第一课使军官们受到很大的启发，打破了对哲学的神秘观点。向胜昌已经成了这所红专大学里最受欢迎的教员之一。
    现在，向胜昌又被邀请到昆明进行巡回哲学讲演，第一次听讲的有云南省各级宣传干部、中共各级党校教员、各报总编辑和云南大学、昆明师范学院、昆明工学院的教授。他的讲演引起了人们的很大兴趣，从事理论工作多年的老干部和白发斑斑的老教授，都对这位战士深入浅出的讲演频频点头称赞。
