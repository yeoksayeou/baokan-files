    Small Car to Replace Tricycles
    (Our dispatch) Beijing, September 29th – The first microcar to replace human-powered tricycles was successfully manufactured in Beijing on September 27th. This car is only 2.4 meters long and 1.08 meters wide, even shorter than a double tricycle, allowing it to travel through ordinary small alleyways. This car is simple to operate; one only needs to master the steering wheel to drive it.
    This car was designed by teachers and students of the Automotive and Tractor Department of Tsinghua University and jointly manufactured with the Capital Automotive Company Repair Factory.
    The main purpose of designing and manufacturing this microcar is to replace human-powered tricycles and eliminate the backward phenomenon of people pulling people in transportation. At the same time, it can also meet the needs of transportation work in the People's Communes. This work has received great care and support from Premier Zhou Enlai. During his inspection of Tsinghua University, Premier Zhou instructed: This kind of car should be made with the lowest cost and the easiest-to-find materials, and it should be able to burn alcohol, so that it can be promoted and used to replace tricycles.
    This microcar is a small car that can carry both passengers and goods. It can carry three passengers (four including the driver). Almost no alloy steel is used in the entire car, which makes it easier to solve the material problem when manufacturing this car in batches. The four-stroke single-cylinder engine installed on this car can burn both gasoline and alcohol, which opens up broad prospects for the comprehensive utilization of high-yield sweet potatoes in our country.
    It took only twenty-five days and nights from design to successful trial production of this microcar. During the trial production process, it received strong assistance from the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the factories under the Transportation Bureau, and the Beijing Guangming Rubber Factory No. 2.

    代替三轮车的小汽车
    本报讯  可以代替人力三轮车的第一辆微型汽车已于9月27日在北京制成。这辆汽车，只有二点四公尺长，一点零八公尺宽，比双人三轮车还短，可以在一般小胡同里穿行。这辆汽车，操纵简单，只要能掌握方向盘就可以驾驶。
    这辆汽车是清华大学动力系汽车拖拉机专业师生设计出来，并和首都汽车公司修理厂共同制造成功的。
    设计与制造这辆微型汽车，主要是为了取代人力三轮车，消除交通运输中人拉人的落后现象。同时也可以满足人民公社交通运输工作的需要。这一项工作得到周恩来总理很大的关怀与支持。周总理在视察清华大学时指示说：要用最低的成本最容易找到的材料来做这种汽车，要能燃用酒精，这样才可以推广并用来代替三轮车。
    这辆微型汽车是一种既可载客、又可运货的小汽车，载客时可载乘客三人（连司机四人），在整个汽车中，几乎没有用什么合金钢，这就使成批制造这种汽车时的材料问题容易得到解决。这辆车上装有的四冲程单缸发动机，既能用汽油为燃料，又能燃用酒精，这就给我国高产白薯综合利用开辟了广阔的道路。
    这辆微型汽车从设计到试制成功，一共只花了二十五昼夜的时间，在试制过程中，得到北京汽车制造厂、交通运输局所属各厂，以及北京光明橡胶二厂等单位的大力协助。
