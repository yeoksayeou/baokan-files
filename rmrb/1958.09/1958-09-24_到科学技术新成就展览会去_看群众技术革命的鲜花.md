Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd. The Exhibition of New Scientific and Technological Achievements opened today.

    The opening ceremony was presided over by Hou Debang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies. Li Siguang, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered the opening speech. Li Siguang said: Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, the mass technical revolution movement is now developing vigorously with overwhelming momentum, and inventions and creations are emerging one after another. This exhibition is held to review the major achievements of workers, peasants, and scientific and technological workers across the country in science and technology. He said: The exhibition uses vivid facts to break superstitions and liberate thinking, which will help to further deepen the technical revolution and promote China's scientific and technological work to catch up with the world's advanced level in the shortest possible time. He said: Many of the exhibits in this exhibition exceed the advanced capitalist countries in science and technology, and many items overwhelm American imperialism. This shows that as long as we can be bold and original and dare to practice, we can conquer the modern scientific and technological fortress. He said: The creative inventions of workers and peasants occupy a brilliant position in the exhibits. At the same time, major inventions and creations do not only appear in culturally and scientifically developed regions, but are like stars all over the sky, with scientific miracles emerging everywhere. This reflects the great momentum of the whole party running science and the whole people running science. Li Siguang finally said: The era of socialism and communism is the era of mankind conquering nature, and the mass technical revolution will be even more magnificent in the future. We must strive to push the technical revolution to a new climax.

    Then, Wu Yuzhang, Honorary Chairman, of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and the All-China Association for Science and Technology and President of the Renmin University of China, cut the ribbon, and the audience began to enter the exhibition hall displaying various creations and inventions. Here, models of atomic reactors, models of huge heavy machinery, colorful light industrial products, and a series of new creations and inventions in agriculture and medicine and health are displayed.

    The opening ceremony was attended by responsible persons from relevant departments of the Central Government, well-known scientists in the capital, and visiting groups from Benxi City, Liaoning Province.

    到科学技术新成就展览会去
    看群众技术革命的鲜花
    新华社23日讯　科学技术新成就展览会今天开幕。
    开幕式由中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会副主席侯德榜主持，中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会主席、中国科学院副院长李四光致开幕词。李四光说：在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，目前群众性的技术革命运动正以排山倒海之势蓬勃发展起来，发明创造风起云涌、层出不穷。这个展览会，就是为了检阅全国各地工农群众和科学技术工作者在科学技术方面的重大成就而举办的。他说：展览会用活生生的事实来破除迷信、解放思想，有助于进一步地深入开展技术革命，推动我国的科学技术工作在最短时期内赶上世界先进水平。他说：这次展览会的展品中有不少项目超过了在科学技术方面先进的资本主义国家，不少项目压倒了美帝国主义。这说明只要我们能够大胆独创、敢于实践，就能攻克现代科学技术堡垒。他说：工人农民的创造发明在展品中占着辉煌的地位。同时，重大的发明创造不只出现在文化科学发达的地区，而是满天星斗，到处都出科学奇迹。这反映出全党办科学，全民办科学的伟大气势。李四光最后说：社会主义和共产主义时代是人类征服自然的时代，群众性技术革命在今后会更加声势壮阔，我们要努力把技术革命推向新的高潮。
    接着，中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会和中华全国科学技术普及协会名誉主席、中国人民大学校长吴玉章剪彩，观众开始进入陈列着各种创造发明的展览大厅。在这里，陈列着原子反应堆的模型、巨大的重型机器的模型、五光十色的轻工业品，以及农业和医药卫生方面一系列的新的创造发明。
