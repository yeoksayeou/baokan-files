Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: Today, the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition opened its doors, welcoming the first batch of visitors from all over the country.

The magnificent buildings of the Beijing Exhibition Center were particularly beautiful today. Sixteen red flags flanked both sides of the square, surrounding the two five-star national flags fluttering in the wind. The golden spire sparkled in the bright sunlight. Water lilies in full bloom in the central pool of the square, complemented by the fountain's water curtain, wove a magnificent pattern.

At nine o'clock in the morning, the audience waiting in the square passed through the vermilion-gilded gate and poured into the central hall. Today's visitors included people from all walks of life in Beijing; workers and technicians from old industrial bases such as Liaoning, Shanghai, and Tianjin; leading cadres from emerging industrial cities such as Baotou and Zhuzhou; heads of people's communes, directors of agricultural cooperatives, and district and township cadres from provinces such as Shaanxi and Gansu; county party secretaries, trade union chairmen, and labor models from provinces such as Guizhou, Shandong, Fujian, and Guangdong; minority ethnic brothers from remote border areas; and commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Lin Boqu, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Dingcheng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Xu Xiangqian, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, and He Xiangning, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, also visited the exhibition today.

The two marshal "camps" set up on the west and north sides of the central hall—the Metallurgical Industry and the Mechanical Industry pavilions—aroused the greatest interest among the people. Visitors flocked to these two pavilions. Whether it was the 43-ton steel ingot standing in the center of the Metallurgical Pavilion or the large aluminum ingot even taller than it, or the large vertical lathe more than two people tall exhibited in the Mechanical Pavilion and the precision grinder that processes parts with an error of no more than one-thirtieth of a hair, these were things that people had longed for for a long time or had never seen at all. Many people excitedly inquired in detail about the uses of these exhibits. In the Metallurgical Pavilion, the audience gazed for a long time at the graph showing China's steel production plan for this year, and they were extremely excited about China's ambitious plan to double steel production this year to reach 10.7 million tons.

Many viewers from various special districts, counties, and people's communes especially liked the exhibits such as local blast furnaces, small converters, and simple machine tools. Many people watched the operating demonstrations, drew pictures, and were reluctant to leave. Next to many large machines on the east square, several layers of people often stood around the "ants gnawing at bones" model. Some people crawled under the model, measured the size of the car head, and watched the shape of the tool, preparing to imitate it when they returned.

In the exhibition halls of the two "pioneer officials," electricity and railways, many models were crowded with people. People listened attentively to the guides explaining the models of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station on the Yellow River, and the electrified railway from Baoji to Fengxian. They were proud that China could build such huge modern projects. The performance of rural small power stations in the back lake of the Beijing Exhibition Center attracted a large crowd from morning till night. All the generators here were running, and the electric lights in the shed cast a yellow glow. Some viewers from rural areas said after seeing these power stations that in the past they always thought electricity was a very mysterious thing, but now it seems that we can also do it on a large scale.

The Atomic Energy Pavilion was packed. People watched with interest the models of China's first atomic reactor and cyclotron that have been built.

Today, people also carefully watched the textile, light industry, and chemical industry pavilions, which were decorated like a hundred flowers blooming. Large groups of girls stood in front of the silks, calicoes, plastics, and colorful daily-use industrial products newly produced since the Great Leap Forward, reluctant to leave.

In the afternoon, the workers of the Beijing Public Transport Company Repair Factory drove the large red buses they had just made yesterday to the exhibition to report the good news.

Due to the rapid development of the National Industrial Great Leap Forward, the good news platforms and leap forward platforms specially set up in some pavilions have already added new production success reports when the exhibition just opened.

    全国工业交通展览会上观众如潮
    赞美祖国的高速度宏图
    报喜台和跃进台又添上了许多新的生产捷报
    新华社15日讯　今天，全国工业交通展览会敞开大门，欢迎了来自全国各地的第一批观众。
    雄伟的北京展览馆的建筑物，今天格外美观。广场两侧的十六面红旗簇拥着中间两面五星国旗迎风飘扬。金色的尖塔在灿烂的阳光下闪闪发光。广场中央水池里的睡莲盛开，衬托着喷泉的水帘织成了绚丽的图案。
    上午九时，伫候在广场上的观众穿过朱红镶金的大门，涌进中央大厅。今天的参观者有北京市各界人民；来自辽宁、上海、天津等老工业基地的工人和技术人员；从包头、株洲等新兴工业城市来的领导干部，有陕西、甘肃等省人民公社的社长、农业合作社主任和区乡干部，还有来自贵州、山东、福建、广东等省的县委书记、工会主席和劳动模范；有从遥远的边疆来的少数民族兄弟，还有中国人民解放军的指挥员、战斗员。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长林伯渠、最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞、国防委员会副主席徐向前、中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席何香凝，也在今天参观了展览会。
    设在中央大厅西侧和北部的两个元帅“营帐”——冶金工业和机械工业馆，引起了人们的最大兴趣。参观者在这两个馆里涌来涌去，无论是矗立在冶金馆中央的重四十三吨的大钢锭和比它还高出一头的大铝锭，或者是机械馆里展出的两人多高的大立式车床和加工零件误差不超过一根头发三十分之一的精密磨床，都是人们向往已久或根本没有看到过的。很多人都兴奋地详细询问这些展品的用途。在冶金馆里，观众们久久地凝视着那块表示我国今年钢产量计划的图板，他们对我国今年将把钢产量增加一倍而达到一千零七十万吨的宏伟计划，感到无比兴奋。
    许多来自各专区、县、人民公社的观众，特别喜欢那些土高炉、小转炉、简易机床等展品。许多人参观了操作表演，画了图还舍不得离开。在东广场的许多大型机器旁边，“蚂蚁啃骨头”的模型周围经常站着几层人群，有的人钻到模型下面，测量了车头的尺寸又观看了刀具的形状，准备回去仿制。
    在电力和铁路的两个“先行官”的展览馆里，许多模型前面站满了人群。人们聚精会神地听着讲解员讲解长江三峡、黄河三门峡水电站，以及宝鸡到凤县的电气化铁路的模型，他们为我国能够建设这样巨大的现代化工程而骄傲。北京展览馆后湖的农村小型电站的表演，更是自早到晚地吸引着大批人群。这里所有的发电机都在运转，设在席棚里的电灯射出黄色的光芒。一些来自农村的观众在看过这些发电站后说，过去总认为电是非常神秘的东西，现在看来，我们也可以大搞特搞。
    原子能馆里挤得水泄不通。人们饶有兴趣地观看了我国已建成的第一个原子反应堆和回旋加速器的模型。
    今天，人们还仔细地观看了布置得像百花盛开的纺织、轻工和化工馆。一大群一大群的姑娘们站在大跃进以来新出产的丝绸、花布、塑料及五光十色的日用工业品前留恋不舍。
    下午，北京市公共汽车公司修理厂的职工开着他们昨天才制成的红色大型公共汽车，到展览会来报喜。
    由于全国工业大跃进的迅速发展，在展览会刚刚开幕，有些馆专门设立的报喜台和跃进台就已经添上了新的生产捷报。
