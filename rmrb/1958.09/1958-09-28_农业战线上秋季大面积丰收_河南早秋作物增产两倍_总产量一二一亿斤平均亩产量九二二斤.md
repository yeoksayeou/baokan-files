Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th: Henan Province has begun its autumn harvest in a big way. Seventy-three counties and cities across the province have celebrated the "ascension" of their four "marshals"—early autumn rice, corn, millet, and sorghum—with high-yield "satellites" being launched everywhere.

This year, the harvested area of early autumn rice, corn, millet, and sorghum in Henan decreased from 21.77 million mu last year to 13.07 million mu. However, according to the harvest situation in various regions and repeated surveys and statistics from relevant national departments, the total output reached 12.1 billion jin, an increase of 8.181 billion jin compared to last year, more than doubling production; the mixed average yield per mu was 922 jin, exceeding last year's yield by more than four times. Fifty-nine counties in the province have achieved or greatly exceeded the "marshal" standard of 1,000 jin per mu for early rice. In Dancheng, Xiayi, and Shangcheng counties, among others, over 300,000 mu of early rice achieved an average yield of approximately 5,000 jin per mu. The province's 2.44 million mu of early corn yielded 975 jin per mu. Among them, thirty-two counties and cities exceeded the "marshal" standard of 800 jin per mu. For millet, with 2.72 million mu, the Shangqiu and Xinyang regions and Ningling, Zhecheng, Xiping, Luoshan, and thirty-eight other counties and cities exceeded the "marshal" standard. Sorghum, traditionally a low-yield crop, has also experienced a great leap forward this year. The province's planting area of 3.93 million mu, a decrease of 6.15 million mu compared to last year, still achieved a total output of 1.87 billion jin, exceeding last year's output by 370 million jin. The yield per mu also increased from 200-300 jin last year to 476 jin, with thirty-eight counties receiving the "marshal" title for achieving a yield of 500 jin per mu.

Various regions have also launched many high-yield "satellites" with yields ranging from 10,000 to over 30,000 jin per mu. In Xiayi County, there are a total of 6,129 mu of early rice "satellite" fields yielding from 10,000 to over 25,000 jin. In the Jigongshan People's Commune of Xinyang County, over six mu of early rice achieved a high-yield record of over 48,000 jin per mu. The Eleventh People's Commune of Shenqiu County set a record of over 22,000 jin per mu for sorghum.

While reaping the early autumn harvest, over 90 million mu of late autumn crops in Henan are also gradually ripening and beginning to be harvested in large quantities. There will be even more "marshal" counties and high-yield "satellites" than in the early autumn.

    农业战线上秋季大面积丰收
    河南早秋作物增产两倍
    总产量一二一亿斤平均亩产量九二二斤
    新华社郑州27日电  河南省秋季大丰收开始了。全省有七十三个县、市的早秋稻谷、玉米、谷子、高粱四路“元帅”升帐，高产“卫星”群到处上天。
    今年河南早秋稻谷、玉米、谷子、高粱等粮食作物收获面积由去年的二千一百七十七万亩减少到一千三百零七万亩，但根据各地收打情况和国家有关部门多次调查统计，总产量达到一百二十一亿斤，比去年增加八十一点八一亿斤，增产两倍多；混合平均亩产九百二十二斤，超过去年四倍以上。全省早稻达到或大大超过亩产千斤的“元帅”县有五十九个。产量最高的郸城、夏邑和商城等县三十多万亩早稻，平均亩产达到五千斤左右。全省早玉米二百四十四万亩，亩产九百七十五斤。其中有三十二个县、市超过亩产八百斤的“元帅”标准。谷子二百七十二万亩，突破“元帅”标准的有商丘、信阳两个专区和宁陵、柘城、西平、罗山等三十八个县、市。一向被称为低产作物的高粱，今年也来了个大跃进。全省种植面积三百九十三万亩，比去年减少六百一十五万亩，但总产量却达到十八点七亿斤，超过去年三点七亿斤，亩产也由去年的两三百斤提高到四百七十六斤，并且有三十八个县获得亩产五百斤的“元帅”称号。
    各地还放出许多亩产一万到三万斤以上的高产“卫星”。夏邑县早稻一万到二万五千斤以上的“卫星”田共有六千一百二十九亩。信阳县鸡公山人民公社有六亩多早稻，获得亩产四万八千多斤的高产纪录。沈丘县第十一人民公社高粱创造了亩产二万二千多斤的纪录。
    在早秋丰收的同时，目前河南九千多万亩晚秋作物也已经陆续成熟，开始大量收割，“元帅”县和丰产“卫星”将比早秋更大更多。
