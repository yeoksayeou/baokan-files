Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: Can rural sports work be accelerated, and how can it be accelerated to better adapt to the needs of the situation? The "National Rural Sports Work On-Site Conference" recently held by the National Sports Commission in Beipiao, Liaoning, gave a definite answer to this question.

The facts of Longtan and Xingfu Communes in Beipiao County educated everyone. Both communes are located in remote semi-mountainous areas, and originally had no foundation in sports activities. After the overall Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the township Party committee, sports work and other tasks were unified. During the "Sixty Days of Great Effort" in the spring plowing, summer weeding, and drought resistance movements this year, all tasks have made overall leaps forward.

The representatives saw commune members from seven or eight-year-old children to sixty or seventy-year-old elders earnestly doing broadcast exercises, and young men and women engaged in various ball sports in Longtan and Xingfu Communes. The sports meet held by the farmers of Longtan Commune, which included more than 20 competition events and more than 1,000 male and female athletes, left a very deep impression on the representatives from various regions. The representatives also personally participated in the labor-defense system tests and technical guidance work. In Xingfu Commune, among the more than 70 commune members who were tested at one time, more than 60 commune members from 14 to 47 years old received labor-defense system Level 1 qualification badges on the spot.

The commune members of these two agricultural communes used the time before and after work in the morning and evening, and during labor breaks, to carry out sports activities, which not only did not delay production, but also eliminated fatigue and boosted morale. The representatives also visited the sports fields and sports equipment built and manufactured by the commune members of these two agricultural communes who did not spend a cent from the commune, and offered their labor and materials in every possible way. Longtan Commune has 62 sports fields, 52 basketball hoops, 97 sand pits, 133 horizontal and parallel bars, 60 stone balls, 105 stone locks, and so on. They also adopted the method of using local materials and learning and using them at the same time to train exercise leaders, labor-defense system testers, and technical guidance personnel. Longtan Commune also used the strength of transferred cadres to set up a "Longtan Sports University," using the method of part-work and part-study to cultivate relatively advanced talents for carrying out rural sports work.

The experiences of Beipiao, Gaotang, and Xiangtan Badou Township have all proved that as long as we closely rely on the leadership of the Party, fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, implement the mass line, run sports diligently and thriftily, and adhere to the principle of combining sports with productive labor and sports with national armed forces, rural sports work can be accelerated.

　　精神振奋　生产日新
    国家体委在北票开全国农村体育工作现场会议
    据新华社31日讯　农村体育工作能不能加速发展和怎样加速发展，更好地适应形势的需要？国家体委最近在辽宁北票召开的“全国农村体育工作现场会议”肯定地回答了这个问题。
    北票县龙潭社和幸福社的事实教育了大家。这两个社都是偏僻的半山区，原来体育活动并没有什么基础，在全面大跃进以后，在乡党委的领导下，以生产为中心，体育工作和其它各项工作都作了统一的安排，在今年春耕、夏锄、抗旱运动“大干六十天”中间，各项工作都有了全面的跃进。
    代表们在龙潭社和幸福社看到了从七、八岁的孩子到六、七十岁的老人认真地做着广播体操，男女青壮年进行着各种球类活动。龙潭社农民举办的一次包括二十多个比赛项目，有一千多名男女运动员参加的运动会，给各地代表留下了极为深刻的印象。代表们还亲自参加了劳卫制的测验和技术辅导工作，在幸福社一次受测验的七十多名社员中，当场有六十多名从十四岁到四十七岁的社员得到了劳卫制一级及格的证章。
    这两个农业社的社员利用早、晚出工前后、劳动间隙时间开展体育活动，既不耽误生产，而且消除了疲劳，振奋了精神。代表们还参观了这两个农业社社员不花社里一分钱，自己献工献料想方设法修建和制造的运动场和运动器具。龙潭社就有六十二个体育场、五十二付篮球架、九十七个沙坑、一百三十三付单双杠、六十个石球、一百零五个石锁等等。他们还采取就地取材、边学边用的办法训练了领操员、劳卫制测验员和技术指导。龙潭社还运用下放干部的力量办起了一所“龙潭体育大学”，以半工半读的办法，培养比较高级的开展农村体育工作的人材。
    北票、高唐和湘潭八斗乡的经验，都证明了：只要紧紧的依靠党的领导，充分发动群众、依靠群众、贯彻群众路线，勤俭办体育，坚持体育与生产劳动相结合，体育与全民武装相结合的原则，农村的体育工作就能够得到加速的发展。
