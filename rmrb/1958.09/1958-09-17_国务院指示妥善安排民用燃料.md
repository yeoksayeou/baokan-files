Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The State Council issued a directive on September 15th regarding the proper arrangement of civilian fuel issues, the full text of which is as follows:

    Although coal production this year has greatly increased compared to last year, the demand for coal has also greatly increased due to the Great Leap Forward in the steel industry and other industries, the development of basic construction, and the expansion of the production of bricks, tiles, lime, cement, etc. required for water conservancy projects. With the great agricultural harvest, firewood and grass have correspondingly increased, but the continuous development of livestock breeding, manure accumulation, and the utilization of wild fibers has also significantly increased the demand for firewood and grass. The vigorous people's commune movement recently rising in various rural areas is universally establishing public canteens, which has created a new situation in the need for fuel. For example, in rural areas of northern provinces, before the establishment of public canteens, families cooked food in winter and could also warm their kang (platform bed). After the establishment of public canteens, warming the kang requires additional fuel. Therefore, how to promptly solve the fuel problem, especially the fuel problem needed for the lives of the broad masses of people, has become an urgent and important task for governments at all levels. In order to correctly complete this task, it is necessary to focus on the following work:

    First, do everything possible to increase coal production, which is the fundamental way to solve the current fuel problem. In addition to continuing to mobilize coal mine workers to further tap production potential and increase coal production, all localities should vigorously develop small-kiln coal production and conscientiously pay attention to solving the difficulties encountered in increasing production, such as insufficient labor, as well as production technology, funding, and equipment. At the same time, it is also necessary to seize the organization of various transportation forces and do a good job in the transportation and transfer of coal.

    Second, take advantage of the current peak season for firewood and grass to organize the masses to seize the opportunity to collect firewood and grass at various times (such as taking appropriate time to chop firewood while working in the fields and bringing it back after work), and make proper arrangements for the utilization of firewood and grass, including feed, green manure composting, and fuel. A portion of the necessary firewood and grass should be reserved as fuel, especially the fuel needed to warm kangs in the north, to supplement the insufficient coal supply.

    Third, use coal rationally and vigorously conserve coal. There is still great potential for saving coal, and there are many advanced experiences that can be promoted. All localities should carry out extensive publicity and mobilization, conscientiously introduce and promote advanced experiences in saving coal, and mobilize industrial, transportation, government, organizations, troops, schools, and urban and rural residents across the country to vigorously conserve coal, improve stove equipment, and improve coal burning technology in accordance with the spirit of diligence and frugality in running enterprises and undertakings, diligence and frugality in running cooperatives and communes, and diligence and frugality in managing households. This can have an extremely significant effect on solving the fuel supply problem. In addition, the people's habit of using firewood and grass for cooking and heating should not be easily changed.

    The People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government are requested to make proper arrangements and deployments for the fuel problems needed for the lives of the people this winter and next spring in accordance with the above principles, combined with various central tasks and local actual conditions, and to check them at any time to ensure that this problem is effectively resolved.

    国务院指示妥善安排民用燃料
    千方百计地增加煤炭生产，抓紧组织各种运输力量，做好煤炭调运工作；组织群众利用各种时机采集柴草，并对柴草的利用做出妥善安排；合理地使用煤炭，大力节约用煤。
    新华社16日讯　国务院在9月15日发出关于妥善安排民用燃料问题的指示，全文如下：
    今年煤炭产量虽然比去年有很大的增加，但是由于钢铁工业和其他工业的跃进，基本建设的发展和水利工程所必需的砖瓦、石灰、水泥等生产的扩大，因而煤炭的需要量也大为增加了。随着农业大丰收，柴草相应地有所增加，但由于牲畜饲养、积肥和野生纤维的利用等不断发展，也使对柴草的需要量显著地增长了。最近各地农村蓬勃兴起的人民公社运动中，正在普遍成立公共食堂，这就更使燃料的需要方面出现了新的情况。如北方各省农村，在没有成立公共食堂以前，一家一户冬季做饭，同时就可以暖炕。而在公共食堂成立以后，暖炕便需要另用燃料。因此，如何及时地解决燃料问题，特别是解决广大人民生活所需用的燃料问题，就成为各级政府当前一项迫切的重要任务。为了正确地完成这项任务，必须抓紧做好以下的工作：
    第一、千方百计地增加煤炭生产，这是解决目前燃料问题的根本办法。除继续动员煤矿职工进一步挖掘生产潜力、增加煤炭生产以外，各地应当大力发展小窑煤的生产，并且切实注意解决在增产中所遇到的劳动力不足，以及生产技术、资金、设备等方面的困难问题。同时，还要抓紧组织各种运输力量，做好煤炭的调运工作。
    第二、利用目前柴草旺盛时期，组织群众利用各种时机（如在田间劳动时，抽出适当的时间打柴，收工时带回），抓紧柴草的采集工作，并且对柴草的利用，包括饲料、沤绿肥和燃料三个方面，做出妥善的安排。应当留出一部分必需的柴草做为燃料，尤其在北方暖炕所需的燃料，以补煤炭供应的不足。
    第三、合理地使用煤炭，大力节约用煤。目前在节约用煤方面还有很大的潜力，而且也有不少的先进经验可以推广。各地应当进行广泛的宣传、动员，认真介绍和推广节约用煤的先进经验，发动全国工业、交通运输部门、机关、团体、部队、学校和城乡居民，根据勤俭办企业、事业，勤俭办合作社、公社和勤俭持家的精神，大力节约用煤，改进炉灶设备，提高烧煤技术，这对于解决燃料供应问题可以发生极其重大的作用。此外，对于人民群众使用柴草做饭和取暖的习惯，也不要轻易地加以改变。
    请各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会，根据上述原则，结合各项中心工作和当地实际情况，对于今冬明春人民生活需用的燃料问题，进行妥善安排和部署，并且随时加以检查，务使这个问题得到切实的解决。
