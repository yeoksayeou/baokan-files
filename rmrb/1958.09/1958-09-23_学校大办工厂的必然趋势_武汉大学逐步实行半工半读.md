The Inevitable Trend of Schools Running Factories on a Large Scale
Wuhan University Gradually Implements Work-Study Program

(Our newspaper dispatch) Reporter Yin Ping reports: Wuhan University is gradually implementing a work-study program.

Through more than two months of running factories and organizing teachers and students to regularly participate in production labor, Wuhan University has found a direction for cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. Many teachers and students have realized that only by participating in labor can they transform their thinking and establish a communist worldview. They have also realized that only by combining with production labor can they thoroughly reform teaching. Therefore, many people have proposed implementing a work-study program to make the integration of teaching and production closer, striving to be both good students and good workers. Currently, various departments are continuing to conduct debates, preparing to gradually regularize labor, making it one of the main contents of learning, combining factories and schools into one, so that teachers and students can both teach and learn theory, and engage in production labor.

In order to implement the policy of combining education with production labor, Wuhan University has adopted the form of running factories on a large scale, closely integrating teaching with production, unifying classrooms, laboratories, and factories, so that students are both university students and workers, gradually combining mental and physical labor, and significantly improving the quality of teaching. Now, walking into the Luojia Mountains, one can see groups of factory buildings from afar, and the roar of machines echoes throughout the mountains. Old and young teachers and students are working hard. The once quiet and dull academic institution has now become a vibrant school and factory area where everyone participates in production labor. Here, there is a steel factory that produces steel and a group of factories built around the development of steel production, forming an independent industrial system; there are also chemical industrial systems, radio industrial systems, atomic nucleus industrial systems, etc., closely linked to various majors; and there are also iron factories and woodworking factories run by the departments of literature and history. These factories carry out normal production every day, producing various industrial products for the country.

Wuhan University's large-scale factory operation began on the basis of in-depth teaching reform. Up to now, more than 140 factories have been established throughout the university. In the large-scale factory operation, political leadership was achieved, the masses were fully mobilized, and the combination of large, medium, and small, the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and the combination of specialized and comprehensive were emphasized. Because the masses were fully mobilized, the vast majority of factories were built and put into production by the masses themselves, without asking the state for money, and in production, they achieved self-sufficiency, constantly expanding production and innovating technology. Therefore, many seemingly simple factories have been able to produce a large number of high-quality products, and they have also become good places for students to learn.

Through just over two months of regular production labor, the ideological outlook of teachers and students at Wuhan University has undergone great changes. In the past, they despised physical labor, thinking that being an ordinary worker was too simple and a waste of talent. Now, through labor, they have realized that learning production skills is not easy, and they truly realize that labor creates social wealth, and they have begun to be proud of being able to be a worker. The change in work attitude has made them more concerned about the cause of socialist construction. Once, a student participating in the construction of a coking plant woke up in the middle of the night and found that it was raining. He immediately thought about whether the newly built coke oven would be damaged. So he put on his clothes and ran to the factory. When he approached the factory, he found that the students participating in the production of the factory had all come spontaneously. They tried to cover the furnace before leaving the construction site excitedly. In order to produce iron and coke ahead of schedule, many students stayed by the furnace almost day and night, and did not complain even after days and nights of work.

In the school's large-scale factory operation, one of the reasons why bourgeois experts were most opposed to it was that running factories affected the quality of teaching. Two months of facts have fundamentally negated this argument. Students' gains in professional knowledge far exceeded the achievements of simply relying on classroom teaching in the past. They have learned to use scientific knowledge to solve problems in production practice, and they have also learned to discover problems from production practice, study problems, and develop theories. Although the fourth-year students in the Department of Chemistry had studied analytical chemistry in the past, they often could not analyze any minerals or industrial products, nor could they solve production problems. Now, the second-year students, through more than two months of labor, have not only mastered the knowledge of analytical chemistry production, but also verified the book theory from practice, and found that many of them were pieced together by teachers and could not be used. They have boldly overthrown these erroneous principles and summarized a set of theories from production, preparing to supplement them into teaching. For example, they have new discoveries and supplements to the principles of titration curves and reference substance definitions in analytical chemistry. Students participating in the production labor of the coking plant boldly changed to using red bricks to build coke ovens, solving the problem of the supply of refractory bricks, and from production practice, they overthrew the argument of bourgeois experts that red bricks could not withstand high temperatures, ensuring that the coke oven could produce coke normally, and there was new development in theory. Practice has proved that only by combining learning with production can the knowledge learned be solid. Students in the Department of Physics who had studied metallurgy in the past could not smelt iron and did not understand the production process of the factory. Recently, they truly mastered the production knowledge in this area and learned to smelt iron from running steel factories. Another major gain in business is that it has changed the shortcomings of narrow professional division of labor and lack of extensive knowledge. Many students have learned a variety of production skills and learned extensive knowledge by participating in production.

    学校大办工厂的必然趋势
    武汉大学逐步实行半工半读
    本报讯　记者殷平报道：武汉大学正逐步实行半工半读。
    武汉大学通过两个多月办工厂和组织师生经常参加生产劳动，已为培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者找到方向，许多师生体会到只有参加劳动才能改造思想，树立共产主义人生观，也体会到只有结合生产劳动，才能彻底改革教学，因此，许多人都纷纷提出要求实行半工半读，使教学、生产结合得更紧密，争取既要作一个好学生，又要作一个好工人。目前，各系正在继续进行辩论，准备逐步使劳动经常化，成为学习的主要内容之一，工厂、学校结合为一，师生既能教学、学习理论，又能生产劳动。
    武汉大学为了贯彻教育结合生产劳动的方针，采取大办工厂的形式，使教学紧密结合生产，课堂、实验室、工厂统一起来，作到学生既是大学生，又是工人，脑力劳动和体力劳动逐步结合起来，教学质量显著提高。现在，走进珞珈山区，远远可以看见成群的厂房，机器的轰鸣声响彻山头，年老的、年青的教师和学生在辛勤地劳动着。昔日幽静沉闷的学府，今日已成为人人参加生产劳动的生气勃勃的学校和工厂区了。在这里，有着生产钢铁的钢铁厂和围绕着发展钢铁生产而建立的成群的工厂，形成一个独立的工业体系；也有着密切结合各种专业而建立的化学工业体系、无线电工业体系、原子核工业体系，等等；还有着文、史系举办的铁工厂、木工厂等。这些工厂每天都进行正常的生产，为国家生产各种工业产品。
    武汉大学大办工厂是在深入进行教学改革的基础上开始的。到现在为止，全校已办起了一百四十多个工厂。在大办工厂中，作到了政治挂帅，充分发动群众，强调大中小结合、土洋结合、专业和综合结合。由于充分发动了群众，绝大部分工厂从建厂到生产都是群众自己动手来作，没有向国家要钱，而且在生产中作到以厂养厂，不断扩大生产、革新技术，因此，使许多看来设备十分简陋的工厂已能生产出大量质量优良的产品，也成为学生学习的良好场所。
    武汉大学师生通过短短两个多月的经常性生产劳动，思想面貌已有很大变化。过去轻视体力劳动，认为作一个普通劳动者太简单，是大材小用。现在通过劳动，体会到学会生产技能并不容易，他们真正认识到劳动创造了社会财富，开始以能作一个工人而自豪。劳动态度的变化，使他们更加关心社会主义建设事业。有一次，一个参加炼焦厂建厂的学生半夜醒来，发现天下雨了，他马上考虑到白天新建的炼焦炉会不会受损失，于是披起衣服就向工厂跑去，当他走近工厂，发现参加这个厂生产的同学不约而同都跑来了，他们想办法把炉子盖上后才兴奋地离开了工地。为了提前出铁、出焦，许多学生几乎日夜守候在炉旁，几天几夜不休息也不叫苦。
    在学校大办工厂中，资产阶级专家最反对的理由之一，就是办工厂影响了教学质量，两个月的事实，从根本上否定了这种论调。学生在业务知识上的收获，远远超过了过去单纯依靠课堂教学的成绩。他们已学会运用科学知识去解决生产实践中的问题，也学会从生产实践中发现问题，研究问题，来发展理论。化学系过去四年级学生虽然学过了分析化学，但往往并不能分析什么矿物或工业产品，也不能解决生产问题，现在二年级学生通过两个多月劳动，不仅已掌握分析化学生产知识，而且从实践中验证了书本理论，发现有许多是教师东拼西凑抄来的，不能运用，他们已大胆地推翻了这些错误原理，而从生产中总结了一套理论，准备补充到教学中去，如对分析化学中滴定曲线、基准物质定义等原理，他们都有了新的发现和补充。参加炼焦厂生产劳动的学生，他们大胆地改用红砖建筑炼焦炉，解决了耐火砖供应不上的问题，并且从生产实践中推翻了资产阶级专家认为红砖不能耐高温的论点，保证炼焦炉能够正常地出焦，在理论上又有新的发展。实践证明，只有结合生产进行学习，学到的知识才能牢固。物理系学过冶金学的学生，过去不会炼铁，对工厂生产过程也搞不清，最近，他们从办钢铁厂中，才真正掌握了这方面的生产知识，学会了炼铁。业务上另一个重大收获是改变了专业分工狭窄、知识不广泛的缺点，许多学生通过参加生产，学会了多种生产技能，也学到了广博的知识。
