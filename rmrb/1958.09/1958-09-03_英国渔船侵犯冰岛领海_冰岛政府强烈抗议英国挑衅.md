Xinhua News Agency dispatch: British fishing fleets, blatantly disregarding Icelandic sovereignty, and escorted by warships, deliberately provoked Iceland by entering Iceland's new territorial waters at 00:00 on September 1st in a planned manner.

The Icelandic government has decided to extend its territorial waters from four nautical miles to twelve nautical miles from the coast and has formally notified all countries. This decision took effect from 00:00 on September 1st. It has received support from countries such as the Soviet Union and East Germany. However, many Western countries, including Britain, oppose this decision.

In an attempt to get Iceland to abandon its decision to expand its territorial waters, the British government issued a statement on the evening of August 31, making a last-minute intimidation of Iceland. The statement said that until an agreement is reached with Iceland on the issue of expanding territorial waters, Britain "must insist on the right of British fishing vessels to fish on the high seas."

Icelandic Foreign Minister Gudmundsson announced on the evening of September 1 that the Icelandic government had sent a note to the British government lodging "the strongest protest" against Britain's armed invasion of Icelandic waters. The Icelandic government also notified the Secretary-General of the United Nations of Britain's act of aggression.

In his broadcast speech, Gudmundsson also called on all Icelanders to unite to resolutely defend national sovereignty and dignity.

Icelandic Fisheries Minister Josefsson also spoke on Icelandic radio on August 31 on this issue. He said: "The entire Icelandic people unanimously demand that the fishing zone be expanded to twelve nautical miles. The unity and determination of the people are our strong weapons in this regard. No warships and no threats can destroy the will of a people who have already united. On this issue, the people must do everything possible to defend their right to survival. The threats of British fishermen will not cause us to act in a hasty and disorderly manner. It is very clear that we will resolutely defend our twelve-nautical-mile fishing zone and will not give in."

　　英国渔船侵犯冰岛领海
    冰岛政府强烈抗议英国挑衅
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：英国三队渔船公然无视冰岛主权，在1日零时在军舰护卫下有计划地开进冰岛新的领海界线以内，蓄意进行挑衅。
    冰岛政府已经决定把它的领海范围从离海岸四浬延伸到十二浬，并已正式通知各国。这项决定已从9月1日零时生效。它受到了苏联和民主德国等国的支持。但是英国等许多西方国家却反对这一决定。
    为了要冰岛放弃它扩大领海的决定，英国政府在8月31日晚上曾经发表声明，对冰岛进行最后一刻的恫吓。声明说，在同冰岛就扩大领海范围问题达成协议以前，英国“必须坚持英国渔船在公海上捕鱼的权利”。
    冰岛外交部长格德门森1日晚间宣布，冰岛政府已经照会英国政府，对英国武装侵犯冰岛领海的行为提出“最强烈的抗议”，冰岛政府还把英国的这种侵略行为通知了联合国秘书长。
    格德门森在这次广播演说中并且呼吁全体冰岛人团结起来坚决保卫国家的主权和尊严。
    冰岛渔业部长约瑟夫逊也于8月31日就这个问题在冰岛电台发表了谈话。他说：“冰岛全国人民一致要求把捕鱼区扩大到十二浬。人民的一致和决心是我们在这方面的强有力的武器。任何军舰和任何威胁都不能摧毁已经团结起来的人民的意志。在这个问题上，人民要全力保卫自己生存的权利。英国渔船主的威胁不至于使我们忙乱而草率行事。非常明显，我们将坚决捍卫我们十二浬的捕鱼区，绝不让步。”
