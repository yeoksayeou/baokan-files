　　The Han River's Today and Tomorrow
　　By Our Correspondent Tian Zhuang

　　For thousands of years, the people on both sides of the Han River have longed for the Han River to bring them joy and happiness! Now, people's dreams have begun to come true. The key project for fundamentally controlling and developing the Han River—the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Project—has been officially announced to begin ahead of schedule.

　　The Han River's Past

　　The Han River is one of the largest tributaries of the mighty Yangtze River.

　　Opening China's water system map, one can clearly see that the Han River, like a snake, flows out of southern Shaanxi Province, traverses northern and central Hubei, and joins the Yangtze River at Wuhan. It is more than 1,500 kilometers long, with a drainage area of more than 170,000 square kilometers, covering five provinces: Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Henan, and Hubei.

　　For many years, the Han River has nurtured the people on both sides with its alluvial fertile fields. The Hanzhong Basin in the upper reaches of the Han River has always been known as the "land of fish and rice."

　　However, like other rivers, the Han River has brought frequent and severe disasters to both banks. Whenever the summer and autumn seasons arrive, the river water sometimes rises more than two meters a day, and the flood rushes like a wild horse. The great flood of 1935 is still spoken of with fear and lingering dread.

　　Changing the Han River's Character

　　In order to fundamentally change the Han River's character and make it bring joy and happiness to the people on both sides in the years to come, the Party and the government have led the people on both sides in reinforcing embankments since the day of liberation. Starting in 1955, China's excellent planning and design personnel, with the enthusiastic and concrete help of highly skilled Soviet experts, carried out complex planning work based on collected data. After more than a year of repeated and meticulous research and comparison, it was decided to build dams and block water at Huanglongya, Shiquan, Erlangtan, Jiaheguan, Danjiangkou in the upper reaches of the Han River, and Nianpanshan in the middle reaches. This would allow the river areas to form a series of artificial lakes. Whenever the rainy season brings floods, these large lakes would store the water and then slowly release it. By then, the Han River, known for its "irascible temper," would not only be as docile and lovely as a sheep, but more importantly, it would contribute its strength to socialist construction according to the will of the people.

　　What a heroic undertaking! And the construction of the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Project is the beginning of realizing this great cause.

　　A Source of Happiness

　　In the past, people's greatest hope for the Han River was simply that it would not "lose its temper" and would flow peacefully into the Yangtze River. However, the future Han River will bring people far more happiness than that!

　　According to the plan, the reservoirs from the upper to the middle reaches of the Han River will store water to irrigate more than 20 million mu of farmland in Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei and other provinces. Because the Han River has ample water, large tracts of land on both sides will become rich irrigated areas. The construction of the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Project alone will allow water to be diverted to irrigate more than 12 million mu of farmland in the Tangbai River basin, including twelve counties in Henan and Hubei provinces. Together with the water of the Tangbai River itself, the Tangbai River area can be developed into a large-scale self-flowing irrigation area of more than 15 million mu. This irrigation area is more than twice the size of the Dujiangyan irrigation area in Sichuan, which is known as the "Land of Abundance" in China, and is currently the largest irrigation area in the Yangtze River basin. At that time, people will only need to dig a ditch on the field bank with a hoe, and the water will flow smoothly into the field. In this way, many dry lands can be converted into paddy fields, and those that originally grew two crops a year can grow three crops a year. It is estimated that this can increase grain production by more than 7 billion jin and cotton by 2 million dan each year.

　　Because the Han River has abundant hydropower reserves, with 3.3 million kilowatts in the main stream alone, the future Han River will have a series of hydropower stations that can generate huge and cheap electricity. Among these power stations, the installed capacity of the hydropower station in the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Project can reach more than 900,000 kilowatts, generating more than 4.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, which is equivalent to more than 21% of the country's total power generation last year. Moreover, the investment per kilowatt is cheaper than the Sanmenxia power station. If it is connected with thermal power generation in Luoyang, Huangshi, Yichang and other places, it will form a huge power grid in central China. In this way, cheap electricity at a few cents per kilowatt-hour can be purchased, which can not only meet the needs of established and developing industrial zones, but also provide extremely favorable conditions for the electrification of vast rural areas.

　　The Yangtze, Huai, Yellow, and Han Rivers Will Join Hands

　　However, once floods are conquered, people will feel the preciousness of water.

　　The Han River has abundant water. In addition to meeting the irrigation water, power generation, and shipping needs of the basin itself, there is still a large amount of surplus water. However, it is separated from the Yellow River and the Huai River by the Qinling Mountains, the Funiu Mountains, and the Tongbai Mountains, which are 800 kilometers long and 200 kilometers deep. How can the Han River be diverted to the Yellow River and the Huai River?

　　Surveyors have found a very ideal route, which is to divert water from the Danjiangkou Reservoir across the watershed of the Dan River and the Tang River and Bai River, pass through the Tang River and Bai River basins, and then pass through the Funiu Mountains, the watershed of the Tang River, Bai River and the Huai River, near Fangcheng. Next the water will flow through the gap of "Shihuanggou" (legend has it that Qin Shihuang once planned to build a canal here 2,000 years ago to connect to the Yellow River) where the mountains join Tongbai, and then let the Han River flow into the Yellow River near Zhengzhou via Xuchang, Yuxian, Zhengxin and other places. The entire length is 450 kilometers, which is 1.7 times larger than the world-famous Suez Canal. At that time, China's famous four major rivers—the Yangtze, Huai, Yellow, and Han—can join hands. At the same time, such a magnificent water diversion channel to divert the Han to aid the Yellow and Huai Rivers will also become the basis for connecting the north-south Grand Canal. Ships can travel freely from Tianjin in the north to Guangzhou in the south. Therefore, China's natural and economic landscape will undergo tremendous changes.

　　This is the Han River's tomorrow! In these days when "one day equals twenty years," people remember what Chairman Mao once said: We are doing an extremely glorious and great undertaking that our predecessors have never done before!

### 汉水的今天和明天

　　汉水的今天和明天
　　本报记者　田庄
    千百年来，汉水两岸的人民，多么渴望汉水给他们带来欢笑和幸福啊！现在，人们的梦想已经开始实现，根治与开发汉水的关键工程——丹江口水利枢纽工程正式宣告提前动工了。
    汉水的过去
    汉水是浩浩长江的最大支流之一。
    打开我国水系图，可以清楚地看到：汉水像一条蛇一样，由陕西省南部流出，横贯湖北北部和中部，经武汉市汇流入长江，它全长一千五百多公里，流域面积十七万多平方公里，遍及陕西、甘肃、四川、河南和湖北五省。
    多少年来，汉水就以自己冲积成的肥田沃野，哺育着两岸人民。汉水上游的汉中盆地，向来有“鱼米之乡”的美称。
    但是，汉水也跟其他河流一样，曾经给两岸带来频繁而严重的灾难。每当夏秋之间，有时河水一天涨两公尺多高，洪流就像一匹脱缰的野马，任性地奔流。1935年那一次大水，直到现在，人们还是“谈虎色变”，心有余悸。
    改变汉水的性格
    为了从根本上改变汉水的性格，叫它在今后的岁月里，为两岸人民带来欢笑和幸福，党和政府从解放那天起，就领导着两岸人民培修堤防。我国优秀的规划设计人员从1955年起，在精湛的苏联专家热情而具体的帮助下，根据搜集的各种资料，开展了复杂的规划工作。经过一年多的反复的、精心的研究、比较，确定在汉水上游的黄龙垭、石泉、二郎滩、甲河关、丹江口和中游的碾盘山，筑坝拦水，使沿河地区形成一个连一个的人造大湖，每当雨季洪水暴涨的时候，这些大湖就把水装起来，然后再让它慢慢地流出去。到那时候，以“脾气暴躁”著称于世的汉水，不但像只绵羊似的温驯可爱，更重要的是它将根据人们的意图，为社会主义建设贡献自己的力量。
    这是多么豪迈的事业啊！而丹江口水利枢纽工程的修建，就是实现这个伟大事业的开端。
    幸福的源泉
    过去人们对汉水最大的希望，不过是要求它不发“脾气”，平平静静地流到长江去。但是，未来的汉水带给人们的幸福，远远不止这些哟！
    根据规划，从汉水上游到中游一个连一个的水库，拦蓄起来的水，将用来灌溉陕西、河南、湖北等省二千多万亩农田。由于汉水水量充足，两岸大片大片的土地将变成富饶的灌溉区。其中仅丹江口水利枢纽工程建成以后，就可以引水灌溉汉水支流唐白河流域包括河南、湖北两省十二个县的一千二百多万亩农田，加上唐白河本身的水，可使唐白河区发展为一千五百多万亩的大型的自流灌溉区。这个灌溉区比我国素有“天府之国”之称的四川都江堰灌溉区还大二倍多，是长江流域目前最大的灌溉区。到那时候，人们只要用锄头在田坝上一刨，水就会顺畅地流入田里，这样，许多旱地可以改为水田，原来种两季作物的可以种三季作物，预计每年可因而增产粮食七十多亿斤，棉花二百万担。
    由于汉水水力蕴藏量相当丰富，仅干流部分即有三百三十万瓩，因此，未来的汉水将出现一个连一个、能够发出巨大而廉价的电力的水电站，在这些电站当中，丹江口水利枢纽工程中的水电站的装机容量可达九十多万瓩，每年发电四十七亿度以上，相当于去年全国发电量的21％还多。而且，单位瓩的投资比三门峡电站还便宜。如果它同洛阳、黄石、宜昌等地火力发电联系起来，就将构成我国中部的一个巨大的电力网，这样，几毫钱就可以买到一度电的廉价电力，不仅能够满足建立和发展中的工业区之用，还为广大农村电气化提供了极其有利的条件。
    江、淮、河、汉将拉起手来
    但是，一旦洪水被征服了，人们就会感到水的可贵。
    汉水水量充沛，除了满足本流域的灌溉用水和发电、航运以外，还有大量的余水。可是它和黄河、淮河间隔着长八百公里、纵深二百公里的分水岭——秦岭山脉、伏牛山脉和桐柏山脉。怎样把汉水引到黄河和淮河里去呢？
    勘测人员发现一条非常理想的路线，这就是从丹江口水库引水穿越丹江和唐河、白河的分水岭，经过唐河、白河流域，在方城附近再通过唐河、白河和淮河的分水岭——伏牛山，再经和桐柏山连结的地方的缺口“始皇沟”（相传二千年前秦始皇曾经打算在这里修筑一条运河，通向黄河），让汉水经许昌、禹县、新郑等地，由郑州附近流入黄河，全长四百五十公里，比世界著名的苏伊士运河大一点七倍。那时，我国著名的四大河流——江、淮、河、汉就可以携起手来。同时，这么宏伟的引汉济黄济淮的引水渠道，还将成为沟通南北大运河的基础，北起天津，南到广州，轮舶舟楫可以自由往来。因此，我国的自然和经济面貌都将起巨大变化。
    这就是汉水的明天！在这“一天等于二十年”的日子里，人们记得毛主席曾经说过的一句话：我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业！
