    The Anti-American Tide on Yangzizhou
    By our reporter Liu Guanghui
    "We have the people, we have the grain, we have everything we need, we must liberate Taiwan!" This is the slogan and determination of more than 10,000 members of the Yangzizhou Commune in the suburbs of Nanchang City to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

    On the evening of the 6th, after hearing Premier Zhou's statement on the radio, the commune members spread the word and immediately gathered to express their support for the statement, declaring that they would completely smash the military provocations of U.S. imperialism. When the commune members recalled the painful days under the oppression of U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government, hatred burned like a raging fire in the hearts of everyone, and they shouted: "Drive the American devils out of Taiwan!" The meeting lasted until 1 a.m., when one commune member suggested: "Turn anger into strength, launch a surprise production effort overnight, and support the liberation of Taiwan!" "Right!" Everyone immediately divided into three groups and rushed to the fields: one group dug drainage ditches for the pumping stations to fight the drought; one group watered vegetables; and one group worked on deep plowing in the experimental fields. In the队伍 were elderly commune members in their sixties and more than fifty women. Everyone worked until dawn.

    On the 7th and 8th, the commune members engaged in production, held meetings, and wrote slogans. Some commune members insisted on working day and night in the fields, operating water wheels to combat the drought. All commune members participated in large and small gatherings protesting the military threats of U.S. imperialism, and slogans such as "Support Premier Zhou's statement" and "Oppose the military threats of U.S. imperialism" were posted everywhere. All of this demonstrated the commune members' unwavering determination: we must liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan!

    On the afternoon of the 8th, news came that the U.S. imperialist army continued to intrude into our coastal areas, which further aroused the anger of the commune members. After work, without even taking the time to eat or rest, they held a torchlight parade of 10,000 people. The shouts of "Smash the military threats of the American devils!" and "We must liberate Taiwan!" resounded through the clouds, and the quiet countryside was aboil. Old commune member Tu Lantou, who was over seventy years old and usually never went out at night, this time held a torch and waved his fist, leading the commune members to shout slogans. Women carried their children in their left arms and held torches in their right hands, bravely marching forward in the队伍. Several elderly grandmothers from the Tengzhou Brigade also joined the parade. After marching until 12 o'clock at night, the commune members went to the fields with hoes and manure baskets to engage in production. The fields were brightly lit, and a heated labor competition to support the liberation of Taiwan unfolded. More than fifty young commune members from the Houzhou Brigade made a guarantee in the fields: work hard day and night, and make sure not a single rice seedling dies from drought. The entire team dug a three-li long ditch in one night, diverting water to the dry fields. More than one hundred commune members from the Tengzhou Brigade operated water wheels until dawn, rescuing more than thirty mu of drought-stricken late rice fields. The first squad of the Houzhou Brigade, in order to fulfill their guarantee of supporting the liberation of Taiwan and watering fifty mu of dry fields in two days and two nights, kept the water wheels running non-stop from the evening of the 8th to 12:00 noon on the 9th. Squad leader Tao Guozhu told reporters: "We are full of strength and determined to liberate Taiwan. Now we must intensify our production to support the People's Liberation Army. Whatever they need, we will supply!"

    扬子洲的反美怒潮
    本报记者　刘光辉
    “要人有人，要粮有粮，要什么有什么，一定要解放台湾！”这是南昌市郊扬子洲公社一万多名社员提出的支援人民解放军解放台湾的口号和决心。
    6日晚上，社员们从广播中听到了周总理的声明后，奔走相告，立刻集会表示拥护这个声明，表示要彻底粉碎美帝国主义的军事挑衅。当社员们回忆起在美帝国主义和国民党反动政府蹂躏下的痛苦日子，仇恨像烈火一样燃烧在每个人的心头，他们高呼：“把美国佬从台湾赶出去！”大会开到深夜一点钟，一个社员提议：“把愤怒化为力量，连夜突击生产，支援解放台湾！”“对！”大家立即就分成三批奔向田野：一批挖抽水机沟，与旱魔斗争；一批浇灌蔬菜；一批搞试验田的深耕深翻。队伍里，有六十多岁的老年社员，有五十多名妇女，大家一直干到天亮。
    7日、8日，社员们边生产、边集会、边写标语。有的社员坚持两天两晚在田野车水抗旱，全部社员参加了抗议美帝国主义的军事威胁的大小集会，到处贴上了“拥护周总理声明”、“反对美帝国主义军事威胁”的标语。所有这些都表示出社员们的一个不可动摇的决心：一定要解放金门、马祖、台湾！
    8日下午，传来了美帝国主义军队继续侵入我国沿海地区的消息，更激起了社员们的愤怒，收工后来不及吃饭和休息，就举行了一万人的火炬游行。“粉碎美国佬的军事威胁！”“一定要解放台湾！”的口号声响彻云霄，沉静的农村沸腾了起来。七十多岁的老社员凃烂头平时夜间从不出外，这次却举着火炬，挥起拳头带领社员高呼口号。妇女们左手抱着孩子，右手举着火炬，在队伍中奋勇前进。藤洲大队的几个老年婆婆也参加了游行队伍。游行到深夜十二点钟后，社员们又拿着锄头、粪箕下田生产。田野灯火通红，展开了热烈的支援解放台湾的劳动竞赛。后洲大队五十多个青年社员在田间里提出保证：日干、夜干、苦干，不旱死一蔸禾。全队一晚挖了一条三里长的水沟，把水引到了旱田。藤洲大队一百多名社员车水到天亮，抢救了三十多亩干旱的晚稻田。后洲大队第一小队为了实现他们提出的支援解放台湾、两天两晚把五十亩旱田车满水的保证，从8日晚到9日上午十二时水车没有歇过一分钟，队长陶国柱告诉记者：“我们浑身是力量，有决心解放台湾。现在我们要加紧搞好生产支援人民解放军，他们要什么，我们就供给什么！”
