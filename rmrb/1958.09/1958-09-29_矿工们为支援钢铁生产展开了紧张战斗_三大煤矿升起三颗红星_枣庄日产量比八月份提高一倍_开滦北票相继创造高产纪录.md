(Report from our correspondent in Jinan, September 28th) Since entering September, the Zaozhuang coal mining area in China, known for its high-quality coking coal, has seen its output soar. After breaking the 10,000-ton daily output mark on the 8th, it set a new historical high of 14,618 tons on the 20th. This astonishing record is 122% higher than the average daily output of the entire mining area in August, and almost ten times higher than the daily output level in January.

    Inspired by the slogan "Fight to support steel production, and support Premier Zhou's statement with practical actions," the 16,400 miners in the Zaozhuang mining area quickly launched a "High-Yield Month" competition in September. The Zaozhuang Mining Bureau Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also adopted various measures to ensure high production, and organized an inspection team of more than 500 people to go to various coal mining faces, eat, live, and work with the miners, direct on-site, and solve problems in a timely manner. They firmly grasped the key link of organizing regular cycles to increase cycle rates for coal production. As a result, the miners' morale was unprecedentedly high, and output increased steadily. On the 20th, the daily output of Taozhuang Coal Mine rose to 5,839 tons. The Dongda Well of Zaozhuang Coal Mine, which had just resumed production in October last year, quickly caught up, reaching a peak of 4,503 tons on September 20th. The average daily output of the entire mining area from September 1st to 20th has reached 10,466 tons, which is 59% higher than the daily output level in August.

    Now, the workers of the Zaozhuang mining area are advancing victoriously. They want to release even larger coal production "satellites" before National Day as a gift to National Day, and make full preparations for a daily output of 17,000 tons in the fourth quarter.

(Report from our correspondent in Tangshan, September 28th) In recent days, the workers of Kailuan Coal Mine have continuously launched high-yield satellites. On the 26th, all the mine's workers launched an overall battle, releasing a satellite with a daily output of 55,293 tons, creating the highest coal production record in Kailuan's history, 57% higher than the daily output level in August, and 26 high-yield workfaces emerged.

    Since breaking the 40,000-ton mark on September 16th and Zhao Gezhuang Mine launching the first high-yield satellite, each mine has actively organized high production and accelerated construction. On the 20th, the Kailuan mining area held a high-production and high-speed meeting to welcome National Day, all the mine's workers responded to the call of the Ministry of Coal Industry, and quickly launched a high-production and high-speed campaign, forming a competition climax. Each mine caught up with each other and improved each other, and new records were constantly set. On the 19th, Linxi Mine broke the 10,000-ton mark; on the 23rd, Tangshan Mine surpassed Linxi Mine with 10,586 tons; on the 25th, Tangjiazhuang set a new record of 12,328 tons, surpassing Tangshan Mine. Then, each mine made combat preparations in advance. In order to solve the transportation problem, the workers of Zhao Gezhuang Mine automatically changed to a two-shift system of twelve hours. Tangshan Mine vigorously searched for floating coal in the roadways, which not only ensured high production but also improved working conditions. The workers of each mine have made high-production plans, and the electromechanical transportation and other units, as well as various mining areas, have comprehensively carried out communist cooperation. On the 26th, the daily output of the entire mining area reached 55,293 tons.

(Report from our correspondent in Beipiao, September 28th) Since September, the miners of the Beipiao mining area, which is rich in coking coal, have continuously launched high-yield satellites of coking coal. The average daily mining of coking coal in the first twenty days of September was 7,345 tons, an increase of 36.2% compared to the actual production level from January to August. On September 21st and 22nd, high-yield satellites of 9,059 tons of coking coal were launched. At present, the coking coal high-yield campaign in the Beipiao mining area is advancing towards the goal of breaking the 10,000-ton daily output mark, and it is proposed that from now until the end of the year, on the basis of completing the state plan, an additional 1.08 million tons of coking coal will be produced for the state.

    The Beipiao Coal Mine is the oldest coal mine in Northeast China. The wooden headframe is already somewhat shaky, some mines still use classical steam winches, and some underground still use mules to haul coal. However, these poor production conditions have not stopped the pace of these heroic miners' leap forward. From January to August, they overfulfilled their production tasks every month, and by September 20th, they had completed more than 85% of the state plan. Tens of thousands of employees in the entire mining area have automatically signed up to work on their days off and holidays, overcoming the difficulty of labor shortage in the leap forward. More than 190 leading cadres from the Mining Bureau to the various mines have also insisted on the production front day and night, using the method of mining coal with the miners, discovering problems from labor, and solving problems to direct the high-yield movement and launch high-yield satellites.

    In the coking coal high-yield campaign, the employees of the three coal preparation plants in the Beipiao mining area have also ensured that they wash and select as much coking coal as the miners mine, without accumulating even a single jin or liang.

    矿工们为支援钢铁生产展开了紧张战斗
    三大煤矿升起三颗红星
    枣庄日产量比八月份提高一倍  开滦北票相继创造高产纪录
    本报济南28日电  我国盛产优质炼焦煤的枣庄煤矿区，进入9月以来产量突飞猛涨，在8日突破日产万吨大关之后，20日又创造了日产一万四千六百一十八吨的历史最高纪录。这个惊人的纪录比全矿区8月份平均日产量提高122％，比1月份的日产水平提高近十倍。
    枣庄矿区的一万六千四百名矿工，在“为支援钢铁生产而战，以实际行动拥护周总理的声明”的口号鼓舞下，9月份迅速掀起了一个热火朝天的“高产月”竞赛运动，中共枣庄矿务局党委也采取了保证丰产的多种措施，并组织五百多人的检查团，分赴各个采煤掌子面，和矿工同吃、同住、同劳动，现场指挥，发现问题及时解决。他们狠狠地抓住了组织正规循环提高循环率这一生产煤炭的主要环节。因此，各矿工人的情绪空前饱满，产量蒸蒸日上。陶庄煤矿在20日全矿的日产量上升到五千八百三十九吨。去年10月刚刚恢复生产的枣庄煤矿东大井急起直追，9月20日就攀登上日产四千五百零三吨的高峰。全矿区9月1日至20日的平均日产量已达到一万零四百六十六吨，就比8月份的日产水平提高了59％。
    现在枣庄矿区的职工正乘胜前进，他们要在国庆节前放出更大的煤炭丰产“卫星”作为向国庆节的献礼，并为第四季度日产一万七千吨作好充分准备。
    本报唐山28日电  开滦煤矿职工近日来连续发出高产卫星，26日，全矿职工展开总体战，放出一颗日产五万五千二百九十三吨卫星，创造开滦历史上产煤最高纪录，比8月份日产水平提高57％，并且出现了二十六高产掌。
    这个矿自从9月16日突破四万大关和赵各庄矿发射第一个高产卫星以后，各矿积极组织高产，加速建设，20日开滦矿区召开高产高速迎接国庆献礼大会，全矿职工，响应煤炭部号召，迅速展开了高产高速运动，形成了竞赛高潮。各矿互相追赶，互相提高，新纪录一创再创。在19日，林西矿突破万吨大关；23日唐山矿以一万零五百八十六吨赶过林西矿；25日唐家庄又创日产一万二千三百二十八吨的新纪录，赶过了唐山矿。接着各矿都提前作好战斗准备。赵各矿为了解决运输问题，工人们自动改为十二小时两班制工作。唐山矿大力寻找巷道浮煤，既保证高产，又改善了劳动条件。各矿工人，都做出了高产计划，机电运输等单位和各采掘区义全面进行共产主大协作。26日，全矿区日产量达到了五万五千二百九十三吨。
    本报北票28日电  盛产炼焦煤的北票矿区矿工，9月以来连放出炼焦煤高产卫星。9月头二十天平均日采炼焦煤七千三百四十五吨，比一至八月份的实际生产水平提高36.2％。9月21日、22日两天，又放出日产九千零五十九吨炼焦煤的高产卫星。目前北票矿区炼焦煤高产运动，正在向突破日产万吨大关的目标跃进。并提出从现在起到年底，在完成国家计划的基础上，再给国家增产一百零八万吨炼焦煤。
    北票煤矿是东北最古老的煤矿，木结构的井架已经有些摇晃，有的矿还在使用古典式的蒸汽绞车，有些井下还在使用骡马拉车运煤。但是，这些较差的生产条件，并没有阻挡住这些英雄的矿工们跃进的步伐，从1月到8月，他们月月超额完成了生产任务，到9月20日已经完成国家计划85％以上。全矿区几万名职工，都自动报名工休日不休假，克服了在跃进中劳动力不足的困难。从矿务局到各矿的一百九十多名领导干部，也都日日夜夜地坚持在生产战线上，用和矿工一块儿采煤，从劳动中发现问题解决问题的方法来指挥高产运动放高产卫星。
    在炼焦煤高产运动中，北票矿区的三个选煤厂的职工，也都做到了矿工们采多少炼焦煤，他们就洗选多少，没有积压下一斤一两。
