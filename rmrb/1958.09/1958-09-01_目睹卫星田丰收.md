　　Witnessing a Bumper Harvest in a Satellite Field
　　Han Zi
    Which satellite is this? It's still impossible to know. Its mid-season rice yield per mu is 30,614 jin and five liang. On August 20th, it was "launched" in Yanhe Cooperative, Xiage Township, Zhegao District, Chaoxian County, Anhui Province.
    Getting off the bus in Xiage Town, liaison officers along the way told every passerby, with indescribable joy, where the "construction site" was. If it takes four hundred people, twelve threshing machines, and eleven threshing barrels to harvest the rice from one mu and six li of land within eight hours, this bustling place can naturally only be called a "construction site."
    It is hard for anyone who has not seen it to imagine, even with the richest imagination, what more than 190,000 rice plants look like growing on a piece of land that is more than 118 feet long and more than 53 feet wide. I only remember my mother's guess about it when I was about to leave: "I'm afraid it's stockpiled in the field." Taking a closer look, it was indeed the case. It was slightly lying down. Looking from above, you could only see the grains and not the rice stalks, really as if they were stockpiled here. It was so dense that sesame seeds couldn't fall through, and mosquitoes couldn't fly in. I suddenly felt that it was densely seeping in here layer upon layer. How many people wanted to explore the mysteries in these layers, using pens to insert, fingers to probe, and everything they could get their hands on to pry, but they couldn't reach the bottom, it was two feet thick. Three fat people weighing more than 150 jin each were pushed to stand on it hand in hand, look, it didn't even budge. This rice field also had unusual features: slender bamboos erected like a forest, looking from afar, like the masts of small boats watching the rice sea, appearing deep and vast.
    After the harvest began, about 1,500 feet stepped into this field, 400 were harvesters, and 350 were visitors from near and far. Regardless of whether the legs were white or black, they were submerged in asphalt-like muddy water. Who didn't want to personally kick this fertile and magical land? Many of the harvesters were veterans. In fact, two hundred people would have been enough. Since such a thing was something that none of our ancestors had ever experienced, who wouldn't want to start it with their own hands? Look, there were also many visitors with sickles. The girls said they came to sing, but a kind of integrated and powerful sound of labor and cheers drowned out everything, "Heha——Hehaha, ——Ha!" It is said to be the traditional call of Chaoxian County to celebrate the harvest, but at this time and place, it is not limited to tradition. This call is louder and more majestic than ever. It has no words, but it expresses the most profound meaning, is the biggest exclamation mark, the richest emotional rhythm, and the prelude to a new era.
    Only women's hands can be so careful. They separated the rice stalks one by one as if combing their hair, and then raised the sickle. Most of the male cooperative members were beside the threshing machines and threshing barrels, making "pyramids." The collaboration of hundreds of people made people see rice everywhere in the blink of an eye, rice! A small river was leaning against the edge of the field, and the olive-shaped large buckets, replacing small boats, were propped up to greet the grains and rice bundles. A large bucket can only hold more than a thousand jin, how many trips will it take back and forth! Seven "small boats" are constantly shuttling to take on the shipping task. The river is deep and the surface is narrow. These water behemoths seem to be driving directly from the rice fields to the site. Many people chased these small boats to the site. The site is also new and has to be larger than the satellite field. But even so, it has to be transferred back and forth during the drying process, working on one batch and storing one batch, and the rice gradually piled up into four mountains. Several old people were striding along the rice mountain with their experience of "nine steps around the waist and thirteen dan." They walked and counted, not believing it and walking it again, "Twenty-three steps, twenty-four steps..." This is also the call of history. Soon they secretly knew that it exceeded three hundred dan. They turned their heads sharply and saw several small scales resting in the corner of the field, "No, this little guy can't weigh it?" Some old men who had originally been selected to participate in supervision and harvesting because of their conservative ideas, you can't see that now, just as you can't recognize who the cultivator of the satellite field is from this bustling crowd. They (the satellite field management team led by branch secretary Guo Xiangman, increased from three to thirty people) also did not stand in a prominent place. What we saw was a joyful and proud collective including all of us! One square of rice was left uncut in the field, saying that it would be left for the agronomists who would be rushing from Hefei to see, for fear that they would not believe it. Someone had already prepared to report to the agronomists the agricultural history boldly written in this field with sweat: They applied a foot thick of fertilizer, and the wall soil and river mud alone reached seven thousand dan; it was densely planted like a seedling field, and ridges were opened, leaving only small rows for ventilation; in the 107 days of drought, people fed it water and fanned it day and night like serving children, "Man is diligent and the land is not lazy," and the land rewarded people's labor selflessly. On August 22nd, more than 4,000 people held a victory celebration. Definitely not only 4,000 people know this history!

　　目睹卫星田丰收
　　菡子
    这是第几颗卫星呢？现在还无法知道。它的中稻亩产量是三万零六百一十四斤五两。8月20日，它在安徽巢县柘皋区夏阁乡沿河社发射。
    从夏阁镇下车，沿途的联络员以难以形容的喜悦，告诉每一个行人，“工地”在哪儿。如果需要四百人、十二部打稻机、十一个掼桶，才能在八小时之内把一亩零六厘田内的稻子收完，这块轰轰烈烈的场所，自然只能称为“工地”了。
    十九万多株稻棵的穗子长在长一百一十八尺多和阔五十三尺多的土地上是什么模样，没有瞧过的人，即使有最丰富的想像力也难以比拟，我只记着母亲在我临行时对它的猜测：“那恐怕是囤在田里的了。”走近一看，果然如此，它微微躺着，从上面看去，只见粒子不见稻秆，真仿佛囤在这儿一般。它是这样密：芝麻掉不下，蚊子飞不进。我蓦然觉得它是层层密密渗在这儿的。有多少人想探索这层层叠叠中的奥秘，用钢笔插，用指头探，用一切可以拿到的东西扳动，都打不到底，有两尺厚呢。推了三个体重一百五十斤以上的胖子手拉手地站在上面，瞧，它纹风不动。这块稻田还有异样的地方：竖起的细竹成林，远远看去，仿佛了望稻海中小船的桅杆，显得深远而广阔。
    开镰以后，约有一千五百只脚踏进这块田中，四百个是收割手，三百五十个是远近的参观者。不问白的或黑的腿子，都被柏油般的泥水淹没，谁不想亲自踹踹这肥沃而神奇的土地。收割手中有许多是志愿军，其实有二百个人尽够了，这样的事既然是我们所有的祖先都没有经历过的，哪一个不愿意在自己的手里开始？你看，参观者中也有不少带镰刀的呢。姑娘们说是来唱歌的，但一种雄浑一体的劳动和欢呼的响声盖没了一切，“呵哈——呵哈哈，——哈！”据说是巢县一带庆祝丰收的传统呼号，不过此时此地，它不限于传统，这呼号比任何时候响亮雄伟，它无词，但它表达着最深刻的意义，是最大的惊叹号，最丰富的情感的节奏，是新纪元的序曲。
    只有妇女的手才能那样细心，她们像梳理头发似地把稻秆一篾篾地分出来，然后举镰。男社员们大都在打稻机、掼桶旁边，他们在制造“金字塔”。几百人的协作在一眨眼间使人们到处看到稻子，稻子！有一条小河正靠在田边，代替小船的橄榄形大桶，被撑来迎接谷子和稻把。一只大桶只能装一千多斤，得来回多少趟呵！有七只“小船”穿流不息地担任航运，河深面窄，这水上的庞然大物，就像从稻田里直接驶往场地去的。有许多人追着这些小船赶往场地，场地也是新的，不得不比卫星田还大，可这样在晒场时也得前后转让，干一场收一场，稻子渐渐地堆成了四座山。几个老人在以他们“九步齐腰十三石”的经验沿着稻山跨着步子，他们走着数着，不信再走一遍，“二十三步，二十四步……”这也是历史的呼号，不久他们就暗暗地知道超过三百担了。他们猛一回头，看见几杆小秤正在场角休息，“可不，这小家伙哪里称得了它？”有个把老头因为原先有保守思想选来参加监收监打的，这时你哪儿看得出，正如从这熙熙攘攘的人群中识不出谁是卫星田的培养人一样，他们（以支部书记郭祥满为首由三人增至三十人的卫星田管理小组）也不站在突出的地方，我们看到的是包括我们所有的人在内的一个欢乐自豪的集体！田里还留着一平方的稻子未割，说要留给将要从合肥赶来的农学家瞧看，怕他不相信呢。早有人准备了向农学家汇报在这块田中用汗水大胆写下的农学史：他们下了一尺厚的肥料，光墙土和河泥就上了七千担；密植得像秧田一般，开了墒子，只留了通风的小行；一百零七天的大旱中，人们昼夜像服侍孩子似地给它喂水扇风，“人勤地不赖”，土地无私地报偿了人们的劳动。8月22日有四千多人开了祝捷会，绝对不止只有四千人知道这本历史吧！
