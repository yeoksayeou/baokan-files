Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: Deputy Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, Marshal Peng Dehuai, hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the entire Albanian visiting military delegation headed by General Baluku.

In his speech at the banquet, Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the Chinese people greatly admired the glorious fighting tradition and indomitable fighting will of the Albanian people. We regard with respect the glorious struggle of the Albanian people for our common socialist cause and in defense of the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and we highly value this struggle. The people of our country have brotherly friendship with the Albanian people, and this friendship is developing and consolidating day by day. We believe that the visit of the Albanian military delegation will make a significant contribution to the development of the friendly and cooperative relations between the people and armies of China and Albania and to strengthening the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

In his speech, General Baluku warmly praised the great construction achievements of the Chinese people and the fraternal friendship between the people and armies of Albania and China.

General Baluku sternly condemned the war policy and aggressive activities of American imperialism. He said that all honest people in the world should ask the United States: What are your troops doing on the Chinese territory of Taiwan and its coastal islands, so far away across the ocean? Taiwan and the coastal islands are part of Chinese territory. How can we allow American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, who have been spurned by the Chinese people, to occupy them?

General Baluku expressed that in the Chinese people's struggle against American imperialist aggression, the Albanian people and their army will always be the closest friends of the Chinese people. He firmly believes that the crazy American aggressors are bound to fail, and victory will surely belong to the righteous Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world.
