Xinhua News Agency report: Newspapers in fraternal countries have published Chairman Mao Zedong's speech on the current situation at the Supreme State Conference and supported Khrushchev's letter to Eisenhower. They have also published editorials and commentaries continuing to condemn the provocative actions of US imperialism in the Taiwan Strait region. They believe that if the United States persists in its war provocations against China, it will suffer a shameful defeat.

The Czechoslovakian "Red Right News" editorial on the 10th emphasized that American politicians should know that all socialist countries regard threats to China's security as threats to their own national security. The editorial pointed out that imperialist military adventures have suffered disastrous defeats in Korea, Vietnam, Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan. If an attack is launched against the Chinese people, imperialism will suffer the same result, because justice is on the side of the Chinese people.

The East German "New Germany News" said in a commentary on the 10th that the world attaches great importance to Khrushchev's letter to Eisenhower on the Far East situation. In his letter, Khrushchev suggested that the Soviet Union, the United States, the People's Republic of China, and other countries work together to eliminate tensions in the Far East. The commentary pointed out that for this purpose, the US fleet in the Taiwan Strait must be withdrawn, and the US troops on the Chinese territories of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands must be withdrawn. There can be no lasting peace in the Far East without these urgent and necessary measures. The commentary concluded that the Soviet government, through Khrushchev's letter, called on the United States to remain rational. All peace-loving people in the world support this call.

The Polish "People's Forum" emphasized on the 9th that at this important moment, the head of the Soviet government asked the US government to remain rational and abandon measures that could cause irreparable consequences. After pointing out the dangerous actions of the United States in the Taiwan region, the newspaper warned that China is not isolated; it has many loyal friends who will support it at any time if China is invaded.

The Romanian "Spark News" editorial said that the Romanian working people and the progressive people of the world unanimously demand that the US troops withdraw from the Chinese islands, stop the imperialist provocations against the Chinese people, and restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Premier Zhou Enlai's statement about liberating Taiwan and the Penghu Islands expressed the thoughts, will, and determination of the Chinese people. Khrushchev's letter to Eisenhower expressed the common voice of mankind and was a call to save peace.

The newspaper said that the people of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union will always be with the Chinese people. The Soviet Union, China, and the entire socialist camp have enough strength to give any aggressor the punishment they deserve. If US imperialism persists on its road of war, it will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

The "Labor News" commentary condemned US imperialism for agreeing to resume ambassadorial-level talks with China on the one hand, and continuing to deploy troops and generals in the Taiwan region on the other. The commentary said that this further proves the US aggressive policy in the Far East and its conspiracy to continue creating tension in the Taiwan Strait.

In recent days, all Albanian newspapers have published the statements, speeches, and letters of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Khrushchev on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region in prominent positions on the front page, and have published commentaries on this.

The "People's Voice" newspaper pointed out in an editorial entitled "Stop the Dangerous Playing with Fire in the Far East" that the Albanian people warmly welcome and fully support the statements of the Chinese and Soviet leaders. The powerful peace-loving China and its role have increasingly been displayed on the international stage. However, the United States is trying to change this situation with armed provocations and the dangerous conspiracy of sending warships to the Taiwan Strait. This shows that the United States has closed its eyes to the tremendous changes since the Second World War and has not learned its lesson from the failure of playing with fire.

The "Unity News" commentary said that today, China, with its 600 million people, is an independent, free, and powerful country, and it has every possibility to solve the problem of its own islands. The Chinese people will give the foreign aggressors the answers they deserve for their provocations and threats.

The Korean "Democratic Korea Daily" published a commentary on the 11th entitled "Full Support for the Just Struggle of the Chinese People," saying that the Korean people angrily condemn the US imperialists' interference in China's internal affairs and infringement upon China's territory, their actions that aggravate the tension in the Taiwan Strait, and fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region. The Korean people also believe that the just struggle of the Chinese people is closely related to the Korean people.

The commentary emphasized that today, the People's Republic of China has all the means and power to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands and eliminate the tension in this region. The great leap forward in China's socialist construction and the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are the guarantees. The peaceful diplomatic policy of the People's Republic of China is supported by the people of the world. US imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean peoples and the common enemy of peace in Asia and the world.

The commentary emphasized that the US imperialists must immediately stop their provocative activities in South Korea and the Taiwan Strait and quickly withdraw their aggressive troops from South Korea and Taiwan. This is the claim that the Chinese and Korean peoples cannot yield, and it is the unanimous demand of the peace-loving people of the world.

Both "Labor News" and "Democratic Korea Daily" published Chairman Mao Zedong's speech on the current situation at the Supreme State Conference on the 11th.

The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 11th saying that Khrushchev's letter to Eisenhower on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region is an iron-like warning to the US imperialists.

The commentary said that the Soviet Union's attitude and position on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region is also the attitude and position of all socialist countries.

The commentary said that the Chinese people today have enough spiritual and material strength to crush any challenging behavior of the American paper tiger. If the US imperialists dare to invade China, they will not only be powerfully attacked by China, but also resolutely opposed by the strong united forces of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the national liberation movement, and the world peace movement.

The Mongolian "Truth News" published Chairman Mao Zedong's speech on the current situation at the Supreme State Conference in a large headline on the front page on the 11th.

    兄弟国家舆论支持中苏领导人对美国的警告
    帝国主义者继续玩火必遭自焚
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：兄弟国家报纸纷纷刊载毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上关于目前局势的讲话和拥护赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信，并发表社论和评论继续谴责美国帝国主义在台湾海峡地区的挑衅行为，认为美国如果坚持它对中国的战争挑衅，它将遭到可耻的失败。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”10日的社论强调说，美国的政客们要知道，一切社会主义国家都把对中国安全的威胁看成是对他们自己国家的安全的威胁。社论指出，帝国主义的军事冒险在朝鲜、越南、埃及、黎巴嫩和约旦都遭到了惨败。如果对中国人民发动进攻，那么，帝国主义也会得到同样的结果，因为公理和正义是在中国人民这一边的。
    民主德国的“新德意志报”10日在评论中说，全世界十分重视赫鲁晓夫就远东局势问题给艾森豪威尔的信。赫鲁晓夫在信里建议由苏联、美国、中华人民共和国以及其他国家共同努力来消除远东的紧张局势。评论指出，为此，必须撤走台湾海峡的美国舰队，撤退中国的领土台湾和澎湖列岛上的美国兵。没有这些迫切而必要的措施就不能在远东有持久的和平。评论最后说，苏联政府通过赫鲁晓夫的信呼吁美国保持理智。全世界所有爱好和平的人民都支持这一呼吁。
    波兰“人民论坛报”9日强调指出，在这重要的时刻，苏联政府首脑要求美国政府保持理智，放弃能够引起不可挽回的后果的措施。报纸在指出美国在台湾地区的危险行动以后警告说，中国不是孤立的；它有许多忠实的朋友，这些朋友在中国受到侵略的时候随时都会支援它。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”的社论说，罗马尼亚劳动人民和世界进步人类同声要求美国军队撤出中国的岛屿，停止对中国人民的帝国主义挑衅，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。周恩来总理的声明中关于解放台湾、澎湖列岛的话表达了中国人民的思想、意志和决心。赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信表达了人类的共同声音，是拯救和平的号召。
    这家报纸说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家的人民永远和中国人民在一起。苏、中两国和整个社会主义阵营有足够的力量，给任何侵略者以应得的打击。美国帝国主义如果坚持它的战争道路，它将遭到不可避免的可耻的失败。
    “劳动报”的评论谴责美国帝国主义一方面同意同中国恢复大使级谈判，一方面又继续在台湾地区调兵遣将。评论说，这进一步证明了美国在远东的侵略政策和继续在台湾海峡制造紧张局势的阴谋。
    连日以来，阿尔巴尼亚各报都在第一版的显著地位刊登了毛泽东、周恩来和赫鲁晓夫关于台湾海峡地区局势问题的声明、讲话和信件，并且就此发表了评论。
    “人民之声报”在题为“停止在远东的危险玩火”的社论中指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈欢迎和完全支持中苏领导人的声明。强大的爱好和平的中国和它的作用已经日益在国际舞台上显示出来。而美国却竭力想以武装挑衅和派遣军舰去台湾海峡的危险阴谋来改变这一形势。这说明美国在第二次世界大战以后的巨大变化的面前紧闭着眼睛，还没有从玩火的失败中得到教训。
    “团结报”的评论说，今天，拥有六亿人口的中国已经是一个独立自由和强大的国家，它有一切可能来解决自己的岛屿的问题。中国人民将会对那些外国侵略者的挑衅和威胁给予应有的回答。
    朝鲜“民主朝鲜报”11日发表题为“全面支持中国人民的正义斗争”的评论说，朝鲜人民愤怒斥责美帝国主义者干涉中国内政和侵犯中国领土、加剧台湾海峡紧张局势的行为，并且完全支持周恩来总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明。朝鲜人民同时认为，中国人民进行的正义斗争同朝鲜人民有密切关系。
    评论强调说，今天中华人民共和国具有一切手段和力量，能够解放台湾和沿海岛屿，消除这一地区的紧张局势。中国的社会主义建设大跃进和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力就是保证。中华人民共和国的和平外交政策受到全世界人民的支持。美帝国主义是中朝两国人民的共同敌人，也是亚洲和世界和平的共同敌人。
    评论强调美帝国主义者必须立即停止在南朝鲜和台湾海峡的挑衅活动，迅速从南朝鲜和台湾撤出它的侵略军队。这是中朝两国人民不能让步的主张，也是全世界爱好和平人民的一致要求。
    “劳动新闻”和“民主朝鲜报”11日都刊载了毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上关于目前形势的讲话。
    越南“人民报”11日发表评论说，赫鲁晓夫就台湾海峡地区局势写给艾森豪威尔的信，是对美帝国主义者的钢铁般的警告。
    评论说，苏联对台湾海峡地区局势的态度和立场也正是各社会主义国家的态度和立场。
    评论说，中国人民今天已有足够的精神和物质力量来粉碎美国纸老虎的任何挑战行为。如果美帝国主义者胆敢侵犯中国，它不只是要受到中国的有力打击，也要受到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和民族解放运动以及世界和平运动的强大的团结力量的坚决反对。
    蒙古“真理报”11日在第一版头条地位用大字标题刊载了毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上发表的关于目前形势的讲话。
