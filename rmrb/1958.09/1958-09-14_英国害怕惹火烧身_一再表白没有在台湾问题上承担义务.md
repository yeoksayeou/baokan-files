Xinhua News Agency, London, September 12th: British Prime Minister Macmillan said tonight in Bromley, Kent: "Our American allies have neither requested nor received from us any promise of military support in the Formosa (Taiwan) area."

Macmillan also said: "Because we are not militarily involved, we are all the more obligated to do our best, through private consultations and public actions, to help find a way to peacefully resolve these issues."

On the same day, a British Foreign Office spokesman, when discussing the Far East situation at a press conference, also stated that Britain has no obligations or promises to take military action to interfere with the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberating Jinmen, Mazu, or Taiwan. He said that the U.S. government has neither requested nor received any guarantee of support from Britain should war break out over the issue of the Chinese coastal islands. Prior to this, a spokesman for the British Prime Minister's office also said on the evening of the 11th: "We have not undertaken any obligations to the United States regarding the situation in the Far East."

The British Foreign Office spokesman also stated today that the Macmillan government has not changed the attitude expressed by the Eden government in 1955, and still only recognizes that the Chinese coastal islands "undoubtedly constitute a part of the territory of the People's Republic of China," but he even denied that the Chinese people have the right to liberate their own territory by all appropriate means. He said, "We regret that there are currently indications that the Chinese government hopes to resolve the coastal islands issue by force."

When reporters pressed the British Foreign Office spokesman on whether he considered the intrusion of U.S. warships into Chinese territorial waters to "escort" ships carrying military supplies from the Chiang Kai-shek group to Jinmen also as the use of force, he actually said that he did not consider this to be the use of force.

Reporters further pressed: Does he consider the recent intrusion of U.S. aircraft into Chinese mainland airspace to be the use of force? The spokesman initially attempted to avoid the question, but later had to answer: "We have not encouraged anyone's aircraft to intrude into anyone's airspace."

The reason why the British Prime Minister and government spokesmen have successively issued statements regarding Britain's Far East policy in the past two days is that an article by former Prime Minister Winston Churchill's son, Randolph Churchill, in yesterday's "Evening Standard" regarding Britain's Far East policy has already aroused great anxiety and indignation among the British public. Randolph Churchill said that after meeting with the Prime Minister, he was "happy to be able to say to the world: Britain will stand with the United States in the Far East."

    英国害怕惹火烧身
    一再表白没有在台湾问题上承担义务
    新华社伦敦12日电　英国首相麦克米伦今天晚上在肯特郡的布朗莱说：“我们的美国盟友既没有要求，也没有得到我们在福摩萨（台湾）地区给予军事支持的诺言。”
    麦克米伦还说：“由于我们在军事上没有牵连进去，因此我们更加有义务尽我们的可能用私下商谈和采取公开行动的办法来帮助得到和平解决这些问题的方法。”
    同一天，英国外交部发言人在记者招待会上谈到远东局势时也声明，英国并没有为干涉中国人民解放金门、马祖或者台湾而采取军事行动的任何义务或诺言。他说，美国政府既没有要求英国保证一旦在中国沿海岛屿问题上发生战争时给予支持，也没有得到英国给予支持的保证。在此以前，英国首相官邸的发言人在11日晚也说：“我们并没有对美国承担关于远东局势的任何义务。”
    英国外交部发言人今天还表示麦克米伦政府并没有改变艾登政府在1955年所表明的态度，仍然只承认中国沿海岛屿“无疑地构成中华人民共和国领土的一部分”，但是他又竟然否认中国人民有权用一切适当方式解放自己的领土。他说，“我们感到遗憾，目前有迹象表明中国政府希望用武力来解决沿海岛屿问题。”
    记者追问英国外交部发言人，他是否认为美国军舰侵入中国领海，为蒋介石集团运送军事物资前往金门的船只“护航”也是使用武力？他竟说，他并不认为这是使用武力。
    记者又追问：是否认为最近美国飞机侵入中国大陆上空是使用武力？发言人起初企图回避这个问题，但是后来不得不回答说：“我们没有鼓动任何人的飞机入侵任何人的领空。”
    英国首相和政府发言人这两天之所以接二连三地发表关于英国远东政策的声明，是由于前首相温斯顿·丘吉尔的儿子伦道夫·丘吉尔昨天在“旗帜晚报”上谈到英国远东政策的一篇文章已经引起了英国广大社会人士的极大焦虑和愤慨。伦道夫·丘吉尔说，他在会见首相之后，“很高兴能够对全世界说：英国将在远东同美国站在一起。”
