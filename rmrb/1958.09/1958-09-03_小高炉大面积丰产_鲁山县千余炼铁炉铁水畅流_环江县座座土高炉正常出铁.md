Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 1st: In Lushan County, Henan Province, the more than 1,300 iron smelting furnaces that have been built are almost all producing a continuous flow of molten iron, and recently a new record of 1,068.65 tons of pig iron produced per day was created.

The main reason for Lushan County's leap from an average daily iron output of 8.5 tons to more than 1,000 tons is that the county's leadership promptly shifted its focus to steel production. The Party Secretary took charge and mobilized the entire Party to develop the steel industry. Party committees at all levels transferred a large number of strong cadres to run the steel industry and established steel production headquarters from the county to the township level, organizing all forces to serve the steel industry.

In the process of Lushan County transitioning from building furnaces to production, they first criticized the "conditions-only" theory and various pessimistic views held by some people because some furnaces could not produce iron normally. They correctly assessed the masses' enthusiasm from all aspects, organized the masses to overcome difficulties, and put forward the fighting slogan "Red flags fill the mountains, satellites fill the sky, factories all leap forward, everyone strives to be first."

The Lushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party adopted a series of specific measures when organizing the high tide of steel production. They established specialized teams for mining, transportation, furnace construction, smelting, and batching in various places. In all units serving the steel industry, they implemented a "four-fix" responsibility system of fixing tasks, quality, time, and location. They also improved transportation roads and mobilized more than 9,900 vehicles to transport ore, coal, and other materials to various smelting units.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, September 1st: Huanjiang County has broken through the technical barriers in iron smelting production. All forty-five native blast furnaces put into production are now producing iron normally, with a daily output of 136 tons, becoming the first red banner in iron smelting production in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Initially, this county had only eleven farmers who had a basic understanding of iron smelting technology. After a large number of native blast furnaces were built, the technical strength could not keep up, and the county went through a tortuous path, with many furnaces stopping and starting intermittently. In order to reverse this situation, in addition to sending cadres to strengthen the leadership of the iron smelting furnaces, the Huanjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party successively held three on-site meetings in the relatively normal Pingzhi and Xiachao factories, summarized and promoted the experiences of these two factories, and enabled the representatives attending the meeting to personally operate the production and cultivate a group of key personnel. After these key personnel returned to their respective regions, they used the same method to cultivate another group of key personnel. Therefore, the county quickly trained more than 350 iron smelting technicians, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient technical strength.

Due to long-term exploration, the county has now found a set of rules for native iron smelting production. The county party committee recently decided to add to the original plan of producing 40,000 tons of pig iron annually, and ensure the production of 80,000 tons of iron by the end of the year.

　　小高炉大面积丰产
    鲁山县千余炼铁炉铁水畅流　环江县座座土高炉正常出铁
    据新华社郑州1日电　河南省鲁山县已经建成的一千三百多座炼铁炉，几乎炉炉铁水奔流，并且在最近创造出日产生铁一千零六十八点六五吨的新纪录。
    鲁山县由原来平均每天出铁八吨半一跃而到一千多吨，其主要原因是县的领导重点及时转到了钢铁方面，党委书记挂帅，发动全党动手办钢铁工业。各级党委抽调了一大批强有力的干部去办钢铁工业，并且从县到乡普遍建立了钢铁生产指挥部，把各方面力量组织起来为钢铁工业服务。
    鲁山县由建炉转向生产的过程中，首先批判了有些人因部分炉子不能正常出铁而产生的“唯条件”论和各种悲观论调，正确地从各方面来估计群众的干劲。组织群众克服困难，并且提出“红旗插满山，卫星放满天，厂厂都跃进，人人都争先”的战斗的口号。
    中共鲁山县委在组织钢铁生产高潮的时候，采取了一系列的具体措施。他们在各地建立了采矿、运输、建炉、冶炼和配料等专业班，为钢铁服务的各单位中，实行了定任务、定质量、定时间、定地点的“四定”责任制，并且改进了交通道路，动员了九千九百多辆运输工具，向各冶炼单位运送矿石、煤炭等。
    新华社南宁1日电　环江县突破炼铁生产技术关，投入生产的四十五个土高炉全部出铁正常化，日产铁一百三十六吨，成了广西僮族自治区炼铁生产的第一面红旗。
    这个县初期只有十一个农民初懂炼铁技术。当大量土高炉建起以后，技术力量赶不上，曾走过一段曲折道路，很多炉子时炼时停。为了扭转这个局面，中共环江县委会除派干部加强对炼铁炉的领导以外，又在生产较正常的平治、下朝两厂连续召开了三次现场会议，总结与推广这两个厂的经验，并且使到会代表亲自操作生产，培养出了一批骨干；这批骨干回到各地以后，又采用同样方法培养出了一批骨干。因此，全县很快地培养出了三百五十多名炼铁技工，克服了技术力量不足的困难。
    这个县由于长期的摸索，现在已摸到一套土法炼铁生产的规律。县委最近决定，要把原来拟定的年产生铁四万吨的计划再加一番，保证在年底生产铁八万吨。
