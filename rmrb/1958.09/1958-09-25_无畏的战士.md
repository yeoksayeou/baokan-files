The Intrepid Warrior
By Zhou Changzong, Xinhua News Agency Reporter

One day, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Jinmen Island launched a frantic artillery attack on our army. Shells rained down on an open space not far from the command post of a certain battalion. The telephone line connecting the battalion command post to the 1st Company was cut. Battalion Deputy Commander Hao Jinliang was concerned about whether the telephone operator had gone to check the line when he suddenly saw a young man jump out of the 1st Company command post—telephone soldier Wang Bangxian—running like the wind toward the area where enemy shells were falling intensely. Hao Jinliang watched with pleasure, but suddenly exclaimed, "Why is he running in a straight line into the middle of the shelling?" He then shouted loudly, "Come back, come back, come back quickly!" But the thunderous sound of the artillery fire drowned out his voice.

The nineteen-year-old Communist Party member Wang Bangxian, who had only enlisted this January, was seen running straight ahead in the smoke, tall and lanky.

A volley of enemy shells exploded around Wang Bangxian. Hao Jinliang's heart skipped a beat. He thought that even if this brave soldier was not killed, he would be seriously wounded. But when the smoke was blown away by the wind, he saw Wang Bangxian squatting in a shell crater, reconnecting the broken telephone line. Another volley of enemy artillery came, and several shells exploded together in the open space, shaking the ground underfoot. But Wang Bangxian paid no attention and continued to concentrate on reconnecting the line. Hao Jinliang saw that Wang Bangxian had reconnected the line and stood up safe and sound, and then continued to walk forward. Hao Jinliang was getting anxious when another volley of enemy artillery came. He saw Wang Bangxian fall down with a somersault, and dust and smoke immediately engulfed him. Hao Jinliang never saw him stand up again. A wave of regret and grief swept over the Deputy Battalion Commander, and he estimated that Wang Bangxian must have been hit. He angrily said, "Send someone to the 1st Company and ask them why they sent a sick recruit to connect the line, and tell them to send an experienced soldier to carry him back!"

In fact, no one in the 1st Company had sent Wang Bangxian to connect the line. The company cadres had not allowed him to participate in the battle because he had diarrhea. He had quietly come to the front line himself and squatted in the company command post with Tian Juefeng, the telephone soldier responsible for guarding the telephone. When Tian Juefeng shouted to him, "Wang Bangxian, our telephone line has been cut by the enemy!" he stood up and ran out. As soon as he ran to the open space, the enemy fired a volley of artillery. The shells came crashing down, but did not hurt him, only shook him up a bit. He steadied himself and saw that the telephone line had been broken in three places, so he immediately jumped into a shell crater and reconnected these three breaks. He thought that with such intense artillery fire, there might be more breaks ahead, so he stood up and ran forward, wanting to thoroughly check the telephone line. As he was walking forward, another volley of enemy artillery came. When the shells exploded, he was nervous and accidentally tripped over something, falling heavily and rolling over. When the smoke cleared, he had already gotten up and walked forward again. Not far ahead was a river, and he found two more breaks, one of which was under the riverbed. Deputy Battalion Commander Hao Jinliang never saw him get up again because when the smoke cleared, he had gone to the riverbed to reconnect the break.

Wang Bangxian pulled the broken end out of the water and reconnected it. He considered that there might be more breaks on the other side of the river, so he jumped into the river and swam to the other side. But the other side was very calm, and not a single shell had fallen. He returned to this side of the river and checked the telephone line again, reconnecting three newly broken places.

In the 1st Company command post, the telephone squad leader went to the open space to carry Wang Bangxian back, according to the Deputy Battalion Commander's order. The Deputy Battalion Commander was pleased to see the veteran soldier skillfully approaching the area where the enemy was shelling, but he suddenly saw a person suddenly stand up from the smoke in front of the squad leader, waving and talking to the squad leader, and then the two of them strode back. Hao Jinliang was excited and shouted loudly, "Someone go tell the 1st Company to give Wang Bangxian a meritorious service!"

The telephone was working again! The company headquarters received the battalion headquarters' order to fiercely fire on the enemy, and the roar of our artillery quickly suppressed the enemy artillery's howling.

    无畏的战士
    新华社记者  周长宗
    一天，金门岛上蒋贼军的炮火，疯狂地向我军袭击。炮弹纷纷落到离某营指挥所不远的一块空地上。营指挥所通往一连的电线被打断了。副营长郝金亮正关心着电话员有没有去查线，忽然看到从一连指挥所里跳出来一个小伙子——电话兵王邦贤，像疾风似地朝敌人炮弹打得十分激烈的地方跑去。郝金亮高兴地看着看着，忽然失声说：“怎么照直线往炮弹打的圈子里跑？”接着就大声喊：“回来，回来，快回来！”但是雷鸣般的炮弹声把他的声音吞没了。
    只见这个今年1月才入伍的、十九岁的共产党员王邦贤，高高的身材，在烟雾中照直往前飞奔。
    敌人打来的一排排炮弹在王邦贤周围爆炸了。郝金亮心里一阵跳动。他想，这个勇敢的战士即使不牺牲，也得重伤。但是当烟雾被风吹散的时候，他看到王邦贤正蹲在一个弹坑里接被打断了的电线。敌人的排炮又打过来了，几发炮弹一起在开阔地上爆炸，把脚下的土地震荡得跳动起来。但是王邦贤却全不理会，仍然精神集中地在接线。郝金亮看到：王邦贤接完了线平安无事地站了起来，又一直向前走去。郝金亮正在着急，敌人的一个排炮又打了过来。只见王邦贤一个跟斗栽倒下去，尘土和烟雾立即吞没了他，郝金亮再也没有看到他站起来。一阵惋惜和悲痛的情绪袭上副营长的心头，他估计王邦贤一定被打倒了，便生气地说：“派人到一连问一问，他们为什么派一个有病的新兵去接线，再叫他们派个有经验的战士到那边把他背下来！”
    其实，一连并没有人派王邦贤去接线，连的干部因为他拉肚子，一直没有让他参加战斗。是他自己悄悄地来到阵地上，和负责守电话机的电话兵田厥丰一起蹲在连指挥所里。当田厥丰向他喊了声：“王邦贤，我们的电话线叫敌人打断了！”他立起身就往外跑，刚跑到开阔地，敌人就打过来一个排炮。炮弹劈空而下，但没有伤到他，只把他震动了一下。他定了定神，看到电话线有三处被炸断，就立即跳到一个炮弹坑里，把这三处断线接好。他想到炮火这样密集，前面还可能有被打断的地方，就站起来往前面跑去，想把电话线彻底查看一遍。正向前走着，敌人的又一个排炮打来，炮弹爆炸的时候，他一阵紧张，不小心又被什么绊了一下，狠狠地跌了个跟斗，倒下去还翻了个滚。当烟雾腾起的时候，他已经爬起来又向前走了。前面不远是一条河，他又发现了两处断头，有一处在河床下。副营长郝金亮再没有看到他起来，是因为当烟雾消散的时候，他已到河床接断头去了。
    王邦贤从水中拉出了断头把它接好。他考虑到河那边可能还有断线的地方就跳下河游到对岸。但对岸很平静，没有落着一发炮弹。他又回到河这边，并且又把电话线查看了一遍，接好了三处新被打断的地方。
    在一连指挥所，电话班长根据副营长的命令到开阔地上去背王邦贤。副营长满意地看到这个老兵巧妙地接近了敌人炮轰的地方，但是他忽然看到在班长前面，从烟雾中突然立起一个人来，向班长招手说话，接着两个人就迈开大步跑了回来。郝金亮一阵兴奋，大声喊道：“去个人，告诉一连，给王邦贤记上一功！”
    电话恢复通话了！连部接到了营部的命令，猛烈地向敌人开炮，我方排炮的轰鸣声迅速就把敌人排炮的嘶嚎声压下去了。
