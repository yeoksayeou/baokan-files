    Reflections on Visiting Xushui
    Li Jishen
    China today has great potential,
    Relying on the masses is the prerequisite.
    Only the Party's teachings can drive it forward,
    Its power is truly like the atom's might.
    Xushui County, formerly ordinary,
    Now leaps forward with astonishing achievements.
    Good things are easy to create when one is poor and blank,
    The leader's famous words are proven here.
    Local cadres are extremely strong,
    Grasping the center and gathering strengths from all.
    Utilizing opportunities and guiding according to circumstances,
    Daring to think and act, progress is boundless.
    The people's drive is higher than the sky,
    From old women to young people and the elderly.
    Each does their best in their work,
    Joyfully and happily content.

    参观徐水感怀
    李济深
    中国于今大有为，
    要凭群众是前提。
    只唯党教能推动，
    力量真同原子齐。
    二等平常徐水县，
    争先跃进事惊奇。
    文章好做缘穷白，
    领袖名言证在斯。
    地方干部极坚强，
    抓紧中心集众长。
    利用时机因势导，
    敢思敢做进无疆。
    人民干劲比天高，
    孺妇青年及二毛。
    各尽所能工作去，
    欢天喜地乐陶陶。
