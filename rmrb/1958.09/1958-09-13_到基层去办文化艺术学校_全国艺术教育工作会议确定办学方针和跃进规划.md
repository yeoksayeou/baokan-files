Xinhua News Agency, 12th: To adapt to the new situation of the cultural revolution, to bring about a great revolution and great development in cultural and artistic education, to plant the red flag in the "heart" of teaching, and to run literary and artistic schools in the grassroots and people's communes. This is the leap forward goal put forward by the National Cultural and Art Education Work Conference held by the Ministry of Culture in Beijing recently.

The conference, based on the education policy formulated by the Party Central Committee, determined the guiding principles, tasks and development plans for literary and artistic education, and discussed the educational reform of existing literary and artistic institutions.

During the meeting, Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, and Qian Junrui and Liu Zhiming, Deputy Ministers of the Ministry of Culture, delivered important reports.

The meeting believes that an unprecedented new atmosphere of great revolution has emerged on the literary and artistic education front. Based on the combination of party leadership and the masses, the new cultural and artistic education cause is developing vigorously, extensively and deeply. For example, in Shangqiu County, Henan Province, twenty-two people's communes were established in the county, and twenty-two farmer art colleges were established. They are basically a new type of art school that is half-farming and half-studying. They are schools, production teams, and cultural and art troupes. They adopt the method of "those who are capable are teachers, and materials are taken locally" to solve the problem of teachers. The purpose of running the school is to "cultivate laborers with a high degree of communist consciousness and cultural and artistic level, who are both artists of the commune and skilled workers in the commune."

The meeting pointed out that in order to meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of workers, peasants and soldiers for cultural and artistic life, and to realize the great popularization of culture, the cultural and artistic education cause must be greatly developed and leap forward, and must be comprehensively planned. Efforts should be made to establish a complete art education network in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions within a certain period. Provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and specialized districts and counties with the conditions should strive to establish comprehensive or specialized higher and secondary cultural and art schools within three to five years; general specialized districts and counties should strive to establish comprehensive or specialized secondary cultural and art schools within three to five years. Cultural and art cadre schools that train grassroots cultural and art cadres and mass amateur entertainment activity backbones in various places should be delegated to county cultural centers or central clubs; townships, communes, factories, mines, enterprises, streets, and schools below the county should establish a large number of mass amateur cultural and art training classes or half-work-half-study, half-farming-half-study cultural and art schools; professional art groups, film factories, printing factories, and craft workshops with the conditions should establish their own schools or training courses. The newly built cultural and art institutions must be closely integrated with the needs of the region, with the main task of training ethnic and folk art cadres, and cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and cultural and artistic professional knowledge and skills, who can engage in both artistic labor (mental labor) and productive labor (physical labor) to develop in an all-round way.

The meeting believes that cultural and artistic education work must be carried out under the leadership of the Party, and resolutely implement the education policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combining with productive labor" formulated by the Party Central Committee. To this end, we must first and foremost put politics in command, boldly break superstitions, liberate our minds, and continue to carry out educational reform in depth. We must thoroughly eliminate bourgeois educational thought, not only plant the red flag in politics and ideology, but also plant the red flag in the "heart" of teaching. We must pull out the white flags of bourgeois intellectuals in academic thought, educational thought, and artistic thought. When cultural and art schools implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, they can adopt the method of going to the countryside and factories and running factories and farms by the school at the same time. Everyone should develop the habit of participating in labor regularly, master certain production skills, and, according to the characteristics of cultural and artistic work, widely contact the workers, peasants and soldiers, live and work with them, and form close friends.

The meeting believes that cultural and artistic education must implement the policy of improving on the basis of popularization and popularizing under the guidance of improvement, and adopt the method of large-scale popularization, partial improvement, and walking on two legs. Cultural and artistic education should be improved from the basis of the broad masses of the people and ethnic and folk art, and should be improved in the direction of the proletariat. We must resolutely oppose the bourgeois method of "isolating from politics, isolating from production, isolating from the workers, peasants and soldiers, and isolating from the tradition of national and folk art" in order to improve behind closed doors.

    到基层去办文化艺术学校
    全国艺术教育工作会议确定办学方针和跃进规划
    新华社12日讯　适应文化革命的新形势，在文化艺术教育工作中来个大革命、大发展，把红旗插在教学业务的“心脏”上，把文艺学校办到基层和人民公社里。这是最近文化部在北京召开的全国文化艺术教育工作会议提出的跃进目标。
    这次会议根据党中央制定的教育方针，确定了文艺教育的方针任务和发展规划，并讨论了原有文艺院校的教育改革等问题。
    会议期间，中共中央宣传部副部长周扬、文化部副部长钱俊瑞、刘芝明都作了重要报告。
    会议认为，目前在文艺教育战线上已经呈现出空前未有的大革命的新气象。在党的领导和群众相结合的基础上，新的文化艺术教育事业正在蓬勃地、广泛深入地大发展。例如河南省商丘县，全县成立二十二个人民公社，就办起了二十二所农民艺术学院。它们基本上是半耕半读的新型艺术学校，既是学校、又是生产队、又是文工团。他们采取“能者为师、就地取材”的办法来解决师资问题，办学目的是“培养具有高度共产主义觉悟的、有文化艺术水平的劳动者，既是公社的艺术家，又是公社的生产能手。”
    会议指出，为了满足广大工农兵群众对文化艺术生活的迫切需要，为了实现文化大普及，文化艺术教育事业必须大发展大跃进，必须全面规划，争取在一定时期内各省、市、自治区都能建立起完整的艺术教育网。省、市、自治区和有条件的专区和县争取在三、五年内都能建立综合性或专科性的高等和中等文化艺术学校；一般专区和县争取在三、五年内都能建立综合性或专科性的中等文化艺术学校，各地轮训基层文化艺术干部和群众业余文娱活动骨干分子的文化艺术干部学校，应当下放到县文化馆或中心俱乐部；县以下的乡、社和工矿、企业、街道、学校应当大量建立群众业余文化艺术训练班或半工半读、半耕半读的文化艺术学校；有条件的专业艺术团体，电影厂、印刷厂、工艺作坊都应当建立自己的学校或学员班。新建的文化艺术院校，必须密切结合本地区的需要，以培养民族民间艺术干部为主要任务，培养具有社会主义觉悟的、有文化艺术专业知识和技能的劳动者，既能从事艺术劳动（脑力劳动），又能从事生产劳动（体力劳动）的全面发展的劳动者。
    会议认为，文化艺术教育工作必须在党的领导下，坚决贯彻党中央制定的“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动结合”的教育方针。为此，必须首先要政治挂帅、大胆破除迷信、解放思想，必须继续深入地进行教育改革。要彻底清除资产阶级教育思想，不仅在政治上思想上插红旗，还要把红旗插到教学业务的“心脏”里去。要拔掉资产阶级知识分子在学术思想、教育思想和艺术思想上的白旗。文化艺术学校在贯彻教育与生产劳动结合的方针时，可以采取下乡下厂和学校自办工厂、农场同时并举的办法。人人要做到有经常参加劳动的习惯，掌握一定的生产技能，而且根据文化艺术工作的特点，广泛地接触工农兵群众，与他们生活劳动在一起，结成知心朋友。
    会议认为，文化艺术教育必须贯彻在普及基础上提高、在提高指导下普及的方针，采取大部普及、一部提高，两条腿走路的办法。文化艺术教育应当从广大人民群众和民族民间艺术的基础上提高，向无产阶级的方向提高。必须坚决反对资产阶级的“脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离工农群众和脱离民族民间艺术传统”的关门提高的办法。
