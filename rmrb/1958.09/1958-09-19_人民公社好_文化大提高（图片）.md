    People's Communes are good, cultural development is greatly improved
    Establishing a commune is like reaching paradise,
    Happiness lies entirely with the commune leader,
    Production and learning are collectivized,
    Every household is filled with joy.
    The commune walls are covered with poetry and paintings,
    Children learn to dance and girls sing,
    Whenever we study and produce,
    We never forget our benefactor, the Communist Party!

    人民公社好　文化大提高
    成立公社胜天堂，
    幸福全在公社长，
    生产学习集体化，
    家家户户喜洋洋。
    社里诗画贴满墙，
    儿童学舞姑娘唱，
    每当学习和生产，
    不忘恩人共产党！
