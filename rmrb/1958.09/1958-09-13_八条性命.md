A Small Scene in the Great Leap Forward

    Eight Lives
    By Our Reporter Fu Dong
    We live in a society where people care for each other. Every morning, when you get on the streetcar or bus, the conductor enthusiastically offers you books and water; when you go to a large store, even if you buy a foot of hair ribbon or a few needles, the salesperson will help you choose for a long time; if you go to a store in the middle of the night to buy something urgent, someone will open the door for you. No matter where you go, whether on the street, in a park, at the cinema, in a restaurant, or at the bathhouse... no matter how far you are from home, you will feel as warm as you do at home. Isn't that so? You may have seen such things even more vividly and touchingly than we have.
    Here is a short story.
    The quitting time bell had rung quite a while ago, and people in the office were leaving one after another. Li Xianghua was tidying up her desk, thinking about going home. Today was Saturday; where should she go to have some fun!
    Suddenly, the phone rang, and a hurried voice came through the receiver: "Hello! Hello! Is this the Special Drugs Department of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Station? I am from the Chengde Pharmaceutical Company. We have eight people here who have been poisoned by arsenic and need a special drug. Please send it to us within twenty-four hours, otherwise, the patients' lives cannot be saved."
    Li Xianghua put down the phone, worried. They did have the medicine, but how to send it? Beijing is hundreds of miles away from Chengde. She calculated that if she could catch the earliest bus tomorrow, there might still be hope. Good! That's what she'll do: go to the bus station!
    When she pushed her bicycle onto the street, it was already completely dark. Unfortunately! A wind had picked up at some point, a five or six grade wind, blowing the bicycle sometimes east, sometimes west, nearly hitting people several times. There was no choice but to ride for a while and push for a while.
    She finally found the bus station, but she was really unlucky. The stationmaster wasn't there. She'd have to go to the stationmaster's house to look for him! By this time, the wind was even stronger, blowing so hard that people couldn't open their eyes. She didn't know the way, and there were very few pedestrians. She wandered through the streets and alleys, and accidentally fell down, scraping her leg. She got up, gritted her teeth, and walked on. She thought, "Eight lives are waiting for this medicine! If I don't find him, I won't go home tonight." She went around and around, searching for several hours without finding him. She returned to the Dongsi Bus Station. This time, luckily, the stationmaster had returned. Seeing Li Xianghua covered in sweat, he was very moved. He promised to deliver the medicine tomorrow.
    A few days later, Li Xianghua received several letters in a row, filled with words of gratitude: "If it weren't for you, our children would have no father, and we really don't know how to thank you!"
    Yes, these service personnel and salespersons, they take care of you, making you feel very moved. You thank them, but they say: "It's nothing, this is a political task assigned to us by the Party and the government, this is our responsibility. Comrade! If we haven't taken care of you well enough, please give us your opinion." If you talk to them a little deeper, they will say: "It is so wonderful to live in a socialist big family! Before liberation, doing this kind of work was demeaning, but now everyone is equal. As long as you do something for the masses, they will respect you and be grateful to you!"

    八条性命
    本报记者　傅冬
    我们生活在一个人关心人的社会里。每天早上，当你坐上电车、汽车，售票员就热情地给你拿书拿水；你到大商店里，那怕你买一尺头绳、几根针，售货员也给你挑上半天；半夜三更你去商店买点紧要的东西，也会有人给你开门。不论你走到街上、公园、电影院、饭店和澡堂……，不论你离家多么远，你都会感到像在家里一样的温暖。不是吗？这样的事，可能你看到的比我们看到的还要生动、还要感人。
    这里介绍一个小故事。
    下班铃打了好半天了，办公室的人都陆陆续续走了。李香华正收拾桌子想回家去，今天是星期六，到哪儿去玩好呢！
    忽然间，电话铃响了，话筒里传来了急促的声音：“喂！喂！你是北京医药站特种药品经营部吗？我是承德市医药公司，我们这里有八个人中了砒霜毒，要特效药。请你们在二十四小时里送来，不然，病人的命就保不住了。”
    李香华放下电话，着急起来：药倒是有，但是怎么送去呢？北京离承德有几百里路。她算了算，要是能赶上明天最早一班汽车，也许还有希望。好！就这样办，到汽车站去！
    当她推车走到街上，天已完全黑了。真不巧！不知什么时候刮起了风，风有五、六级，吹得车子一会儿东，一会儿西，有几次差点撞着人。没办法，只好骑一阵，推一阵。
    好容易找到了汽车站，可是真倒霉，站长不在，到站长家里去找一找吧！这时风更大了，风吹得人眼睛都睁不开，她不识路，行人又很少，她在大街小巷乱撞，不小心，摔了个大跟斗，腿碰破了，她爬起来，咬着牙走。她想：“八条命等着这药呢！找不到，今晚不回家去。”她绕来绕去，找了几个钟头也没找到。她又回到东四汽车站，这次，可好，站长回来了，站长见李香华累得浑身是汗，很感动。他答应明天一定送到。
    过了些天，李香华接连收到好几封信，信上写满了感激的话：“要不是你，我们的孩子就没爸爸了，我们真不知说什么来谢你好！”
    是的，这些服务员、售货员，他们照护你，使你很感动，你谢他们，可是他们说：“这有什么，这是党和政府交给我们的政治任务，这是我们的责任。同志！照护不周到的地方，请提意见。”你如果再和他们谈得深一点，他们就会说：“生活在社会主义大家庭里真幸福！解放前干这种活是低三下四，现在人人一般高，你只要给群众做了一点事，群众就会尊重你，感激你！”
