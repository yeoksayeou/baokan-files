The Masses Cheerfully March Towards the Commune
By our reporter Ji Xichen

Autumn. The Sichuan West Plain is a golden expanse. The good news of the harvest and the commune spreads across the fields like the east wind.

Celebrating the Harvest, Establishing People's Communes

In Wenjiang County, known as the "Land of Abundance," these days, festival couplets, slogans, and archways are posted and erected everywhere in towns, villages, and beside rice paddies. Before the sun rises, people step through the dew, cross the fields being harvested, and pour in from all directions towards the building with the "Upstream People's Commune" sign, banging gongs and drums, joyfully delivering their applications, declarations, and guarantees to the commune committee.

The applications, densely written and covered with fingerprints, representing the hearts of thousands, were received overnight, totaling sixteen or seventeen thousand. The endless stream of people applying to join the commune kept the branch secretary, Yin Jiande, awake almost all night. He had just fallen asleep when he was woken up again by Zhou Dejin, a poor peasant, who had privately connected twenty more households. Sixty-two-year-old Granny Peng, holding a torch, knocked on the door with her cane and said, "You can't leave the old woman outside the commune, I want to bring several broods of chicks to join the commune!"

Poor and lower-middle peasants are the pioneers and backbone of the People's Commune movement. Even a few rich peasants who stubbornly wanted to take the old path in the past, after watching for two years, are now eagerly demanding to join the commune. Zhu Taiyuan, an upper-middle peasant who had publicly declared that he would "compete with the cooperative for ten years," applied to join the commune several times. The cadres deliberately said to him, "Our competition isn't over yet!" Zhu Taiyuan said, "I hung up the 'no contest' sign long ago, I don't want to be a negative example outside the commune anymore." When he contributed all his means of production to the commune and was approved as a commune member, he happily told everyone he met, "From individual farming to the commune, I've ascended to heaven in one step!"

Realizing a Thousand-Year Dream

The masses of peasants enthusiastically and orderly join the People's Commune because the vast majority of the people clearly see their great future in the People's Commune.

This "Upstream People's Commune," centered on Wenjiang Chengguan, consisting of six townships, one hundred and sixty-seven agricultural cooperatives, and some non-agricultural households, has more than eighteen thousand three hundred households, over seventy-four thousand people, and one hundred and twenty thousand acres of fertile land. In addition, the commune has twenty-three specialized and comprehensive factories for steel, machinery, repair, agricultural product processing, fertilizers, pesticides, and clothing, six comprehensive stores with forty-eight outlets, a capable militia force, and quite impressive middle schools, theaters, and cinemas. The unity of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers has realized the people's thousand-year dream.

At mass rallies debating "whether to establish a People's Commune" and "how to run a People's Commune well," many people, based on their own experiences, explained that the People's Commune is the "inevitable path" for the people, the key and direction to accelerating the construction of socialism ahead of schedule. They said: although this area is known as the "land ocean" of the Dujiangyan irrigation area, the rivers, as dense as spider webs, have not been rationally adjusted, not only occupying too much farmland, but also often causing water disputes between the upper and lower reaches. The vast plain is very suitable for mechanized farming, but tractors cannot enter the fragmented small plots. People have long hoped to rationally adjust the water system and use machines to cultivate the land, but because of the small townships and cooperatives, with few people, little land, and limited funds, large-scale operations and construction have been impossible, restricting the development of productive forces. But now? The People's Commune has given the people wings to fly.

The More We Debate, the Clearer We Become

After the great airing of views, great contending, and great debate, the communist ideology that has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people is increasingly demonstrating its power and brilliance in the struggle to build a new life.

To take the path of collectivism and communism, or the path of individualism and departmentalism? Every step in the process of establishing the commune is permeated with the struggle between two roads.

"After working hard for two or three years, finally accumulating some money, it really hurts to see it go to the commune."

Shang Zhiqing, an old upper-middle peasant sitting in the corner, has always been known for his ability to make "small calculations," and villagers nicknamed him "Shang Zhuge Liang." When "Shang Zhuge Liang" subtly expressed his unwillingness to merge with the poor cooperatives and demanded to divide the public accumulation, a chorus of rebuttals immediately rang out in the meeting.

At this time, poor peasant Peng Jinhua walked to the center of the room, gesturing and saying, "We admit that our cooperative is rich and other cooperatives are poor. However, we cannot forget the pain once the scars have healed, and look down on the poor cooperatives just because we have become prosperous. We changed from poor to rich, wasn't it because of the large cooperative with many people and great strength!"

Peng Jinhua's incisive speech suddenly awakened everyone, realizing that only with "everyone for me, and me for everyone" can we have a happier future. When everyone unanimously resolved to transfer all the public property, public accumulation, and reserve grain of the advanced cooperative to the People's Commune without exception, the enthusiastic applause drowned out the sound of the late-night autumn rain.

Leaping to New Heights

The People's Commune brings new drive and hope to the people. In the vast fields, the middle rice has just been harvested on one side, and waves of mud are being plowed on the other. In order to strive for a fifteen-fold increase in wheat production, a six-fold increase in rapeseed production, and a two-fold increase in hemp production next year, the commune members are harvesting and deeply cultivating the land at the same time. More than 5,000 mu of Victory rapeseed, sown twenty days earlier than in the past, are all highly densely planted. The crowds busy accumulating fertilizer on the field ridges and roads are using the accumulation of 330,000 jin of fertilizer per household as a gift to celebrate National Day. Due to timely publicity of policies and the exposure of saboteurs spreading rumors, 2,500 more pigs have been added in ten days, and many production teams have reached one pig per person. In order to overcome the cold and increase the ground temperature and water temperature of the late rice, in addition to lighting bonfires on the field ridges, tens of millions of jin of lime and plant ash are scattered on the paddy fields. Under the careful management of the people, the 7,000 mu of dense late rice grows like a green wall. When a day of intense labor ends, at a spontaneously held evening party, sixty-two-year-old poor peasant Li Mingde sang his clapper talk "Eighteen Sings" with great enthusiasm. When asked why he was singing, he struck a riding posture and said, "Riding a fast horse, climbing to new heights, heading towards communism, who can't sing with joy?"

    万众欢腾奔公社
    本报记者  纪希晨
    秋天，川西平原一片金色。丰收和公社的喜讯，像东风吹遍了田野。
    庆丰收建立人民公社
    “天府之国”中的温江县，这些日子，城镇里，村庄中，稻田旁，到处张贴、竖立着节日的对联、标语和牌坊。太阳还没升起，人们就踏着露水，穿过正在收割的田野，从四方八面涌向挂着“上游人民公社”牌子的房子跟前，敲锣打鼓、欢天喜地的把他们的申请书、决心书、保证书，送到社委会来。
    写得密密麻麻、盖满手印，代表了千万颗心的入社申请书，一夜之间，就收了一万六七千张。申请入社的川流不息的人群，使得支部书记尹建德整夜几乎都没有睡眠。刚刚睡下，就又被贫农周德金个别串连来的二十多户农民喊醒来。六十二岁的彭老大娘，点着火把，用拐杖敲着门说：“可不能把老娘丢在社外边，我要多抱几窝鸡娃来入社！”
    贫农和下中农是人民公社运动的先锋和骨干。而少数原来曾顽固地要走老路的单干富裕农民，看了两年之后，如今也都急如星火地要求入公社。曾公开宣布要和“合作社比赛十年”的单干上中农朱太元，几次申请入公社。干部故意对他说：“我们比赛还没完哩！”朱太元说：“我早挂了免战牌，我可不愿再在社外当反面教员。”当他将生产资料全部入社、被批准作公社社员的时候，他高兴得逢人便说：“从单干到公社，我是一步登天！”
  实现了千年愿望
    农民群众热情而有秩序地加入人民公社，是因为广大群众从人民公社中，清楚地看见了自己伟大的未来。
    这个以温江城关为中心，由六个乡，一百六十七个农业社，和部分非农业户组成的“上游人民公社”，拥有一万八千三百多户，七万四千多人口，十二万亩肥沃的良田。此外，社内还有二十三个钢铁、机械、修配、农产品加工、化肥、农药、被服等专业和综合工厂，有六个设有四十八个门市部的综合商店，有一支精悍的民兵武装，有相当漂亮的中学、剧场和电影院。工农商学兵的合一，使人们几千年的愿望得到了实现。
    在辩论“要不要建立人民公社”“如何才能办好人民公社”的群众集会上，许多人根据自身的经验，说明人民公社是人民的“必由之路”，是加速提前建成社会主义的钥匙和方向。他们说：这儿虽是被称为“陆地海洋”的都江堰灌区，但是，密如蛛网的河流，由于缺乏合理调整，不仅过多占用了耕地，上游和下流之间也常闹用水的纠纷。辽阔的平原，本来极适于机耕，可是拖拉机却开不进割裂零碎的小地块。人们早就希望合理调整水系，用机器耕耘土地，只因小乡小社，人少地少资金少，一直不能进行大规模的经营和建设，束缚了生产力的发展。现在呢？人民公社给人民添上了飞翔的翅膀。
    越辩越明白
    经过大鸣大放大辩论以后，深入人心的共产主义思想，在建设新生活的斗争中，愈来愈显示出它的威力和光芒。
    走集体主义、共产主义的道路，还是走个人主义、本位主义的道路？公社建立过程中的每一步骤，都贯穿着两条道路的斗争。
    “辛辛苦苦闹腾两三年，好不容易积累一些钱，眼看归公社，实在心痛。”
    坐在角落里的老上中农尚之清，一向以会打“小算盘”著名，村人叫他绰号“尚孔明”。当“尚孔明”转弯抹角说出他不愿同穷社合并，要求分掉公共积累时，会场里立刻响起一片反驳声。
    这时，贫农彭金华走到屋当中，打着手势说：“我们社富，别的社穷，应当承认这种不同。但是，我们可不能好了疮疤忘了痛，刚富裕起来就看不起穷社了。我们由穷变富，还不是靠着人多力大的合作社！”
    彭金华一针见血的发言，使大家猛然醒过来，认识到只有“我为人人，人人为我”，才能有更加幸福的未来。当大家一致决议把高级社的全部公共财产、公共积累、储备粮，一文不少的移交给人民公社的时候，热烈的掌声，压倒了深夜的秋雨声。
    跃向新高峰
    人民公社给人们带来新的干劲和希望。在辽阔的田野上，这边刚收割完中稻，那边又犁起泥土的波浪。公社为争取明年麦子增产十五倍，油菜增产六倍，大麻增产两倍，人们一边收割，一边深耕土地。比过去提前二十天播下种的五千多亩胜利油菜全部实行高度密植。忙着在田坎路边积肥的人群，把每户积肥三十三万斤作为向国庆的献礼。由于及时宣传政策，揭破坏分子的造谣，十天中新增二千五百只毛猪，许多生产队都达到一人一头猪。为战胜寒冷，提高晚稻的地温水温，除了在田坎上燃起火堆，还把数千万斤石灰、草木灰撒盖在稻田上，在人们精心管理下，七千亩密蓬蓬的晚稻，长得像堵绿色的墙。当一天紧张劳动结束的时候，在群众自发举行的晚会上，六十二岁的贫农李明德老汉，手舞足蹈的唱起他的快板“十八唱”。别人问他为啥唱，他摆着骑马架势说：“骑快马，上高峰，奔向共产主义，谁能不欢唱？”
