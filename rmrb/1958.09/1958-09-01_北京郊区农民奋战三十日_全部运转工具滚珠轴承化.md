    Beijing Suburban Farmers Fight for Thirty Days
　　All Operating Tools Converted to Ball Bearings
    (Our report) With Party secretaries at all levels in the Beijing suburbs personally taking charge, and the entire Party and all the people mobilized, a month-long battle achieved the ball bearing conversion of all operating tools. As of August 30th, the entire suburban area had produced more than 152,000 sets of various types of ball bearings and more than 1.8 million ball bearings. More than 100,000 pieces of operating tools and agricultural implements, including large carts, waterwheels, handcarts, stone rollers, stone mills, and double-wheeled double-blade plows, have been fitted with ball bearings.
    After the Municipal Party Committee convened a farm tool improvement conference on July 29th and decided that all operating tools in the suburbs should be converted to ball bearings in August, the district Party committees in the suburbs organized a large number of cadres to go deep into the sub-districts to mobilize the masses to vigorously manufacture them. The vast numbers of cadres and the masses, displaying the spirit of hard work, bitter struggle, great effort, and fierce advancement, overcame the difficulties of lacking equipment, raw materials, and technical knowledge. The agricultural cooperatives alone established 116 ball bearing factories, involving a total of 363,000 workers, farmers, students, cadres, and soldiers in this movement.
    During the movement, the people in the suburbs promoted the spirit of communist mutual cooperation and mutual support. Tongzhou District divided the entire district into eight collaboration zones, and Changping District divided it into seven collaboration zones, providing mutual support in terms of manpower and materials. Townships that progressed quickly actively helped townships that progressed slowly. Dongba Township in Chaoyang District sent the director and technicians from the farm tool repair and assembly plant to neighboring townships to help install ball bearings and provided raw materials as support. The troops stationed in a certain township in Tongzhou District used the gaps in training not only to produce a large number of ball bearings for the agricultural cooperatives but also helped the agricultural cooperatives install ball bearings on 300 large carts. The masses described this spirit of great collaboration by saying: "Blacksmiths shine brightly, carpenters charge forward, soldiers and civilians work together, and the task is completed ahead of schedule."

    北京郊区农民奋战三十日
　　全部运转工具滚珠轴承化
    本报讯　北京市郊区各级党委书记亲自挂帅，全党全民一齐动员，大战一个月，实现运转工具滚珠轴承化。截止8月30日，全郊区生产了各种型号的滚珠轴承十五万二千多套，滚珠一百八十多万粒，已有大车、水车、手推车、石碾、石磨、双轮双铧犁等二十五种十万多件运转工具和农具安上了滚珠轴承。
    7月29日市委召开农具改良会议，决定郊区一切运转工具在8月份实现滚珠轴承化以后，郊区各区区委即组织了大批干部深入各分社发动群众大力制造。广大干部和群众，拿出了穷干苦干大干猛干的精神，克服了没有设备、没有原料、不懂技术的困难，仅农业社就建立起一百一十六座滚珠轴承厂，卷入这一运动的工人、农民、学生、干部、军人共达三十六万三千多人。
    运动中郊区人民发扬了共产主义互相协作、互相支援的精神。通州区将全区划分了八个协作区，昌平区划分了七个协作区，从人力、物力等方面互相支援。进度快的乡主动的帮助进度慢的乡。朝阳区东霸乡派出农具修配厂的厂长和技术人员去邻近的乡帮助安装滚珠轴承，并拿出原料支援。通州区某乡驻军利用训练空隙，不但给农业社生产了大批滚珠轴承，还帮助农业社把三百辆大车安装上了滚珠轴承。群众形容这种大协作的干劲说：“铁匠放光芒、木匠打冲锋、军民一齐干、任务提前完”。　　　　　　　（张家振）
