    “Mother of the Soldiers” Leads the Militia

    In Xiapan Song, Jianping County, Hebei Province, Rong Guanxiu, "Mother of the Soldiers," is leading more than 170 young and middle-aged people in the village to launch a high tide of military training and production.

    On the evening of September 8th, the villagers held a demonstration meeting hosted by Rong Guanxiu to support Premier Zhou's statement against U.S. imperialist aggression. Rong Guanxiu said angrily: "We defeated Japan in eight years, wiped out several million Chiang Kai-shek bandits in three years, and after liberation, we defeated the American devils together with the Korean people in Korea. The 600 million Chinese people are not to be trifled with. If the U.S. imperialist paper tiger is blind and dares to launch a war to prevent us from liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands, we will surely let it die without a burial place."

    On that very day, everyone in the village who could hold a gun requested to join the militia. That evening, Rong Guanxiu led 50 women and 32 young and middle-aged men and women, respectively, into three militia combat platoons and one rear support platoon. Rong Guanxiu personally served as commander and put forward the fighting slogan of "no delay in production or training" to all the militiamen. Early the next morning, Rong Guanxiu led all the village militia to the fields with weapons and farm tools, beginning a new battle. (Han Chaowen)

    “子弟兵的母亲”带民兵
    在河北建屏县下盘松，“子弟兵的母亲”戎冠秀领导全村一百七十多个青壮年，掀起了练兵、生产高潮。
    9月8日晚上，全村群众在戎冠秀的主持下召开了拥护周总理声明反对美帝国主义侵略的示威大会。戎冠秀愤怒地说：“我们八年打败了日本，三年消灭了几百万蒋匪军，解放后又在朝鲜同朝鲜人民一起打败了美国鬼子。六亿中国人民不是好惹的。美帝国主义这个纸老虎，如果瞎了眼睛，胆敢发动战争，阻止我们解放台湾和沿海岛屿，我们就一定让它死无葬身之地。”
    就在这一天，全村凡能拿动枪杆的人都要求报名参加民兵。戎冠秀当晚就领导五十个妇女和三十二个男子青壮年，分别编成了三个民兵战斗排和一个后方支援排。戎冠秀亲任指挥，并且向全体民兵提出了生产、训练两不误的战斗口号。第二天一早，戎冠秀就领导全村民兵带着武器、农具，到田间开始了新的战斗。　　（韩朝文）
