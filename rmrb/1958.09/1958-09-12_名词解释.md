Glossary of Terms

　　Soil texture: This is a soil mechanics term. When building roads, dams, and factories during infrastructure construction, the physical properties of the soil related to soil mechanics must be considered. This is different from studying soil properties from the perspective of agricultural production.

　　Soil parent material: Refers to weathered rock, sediments, and alluvial deposits. It is a product of geological processes and the predecessor of soil. It has not been, or has only been slightly, affected by biological activity and crop growth. It does not contain organic matter, and the soil particles are arranged more tightly.
