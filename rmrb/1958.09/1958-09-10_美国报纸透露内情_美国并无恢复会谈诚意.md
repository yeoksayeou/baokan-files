U.S. Newspapers Reveal Inside Story
U.S. Has No Sincerity in Resuming Talks

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th – According to comments in American newspapers, the White House's statement that the United States "agrees" to resume Sino-American talks at the ambassadorial level lacks sincerity and is intended to repeat delaying tactics and make the Chinese people relax their vigilance.

American newspapers reported with large headlines that on the second day after the White House issued a statement on the United States' "readiness to immediately" resume Sino-American ambassadorial talks, U.S. Navy ships invaded the territorial waters of the People's Republic of China, protecting Chiang Kai-shek's military transport ships heading to Jinmen Island. According to reports from some American news agencies, U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek's reconnaissance planes conducted "joint" flights in the coastal areas of the People's Republic of China on the 7th. United Press International openly declared that the Pentagon spokesman on the 8th "ignored" the Chinese government's warning against the U.S. armed forces' violation of Chinese territorial waters, and threatened that the U.S. Seventh Fleet "will continue to escort" Chiang Kai-shek's ships. This Pentagon official spokesman, who was described by UPI as "understanding the U.S. Far East military plan," said that the U.S. military will "continue to provide escort as long as it deems it necessary."

According to American newspapers, U.S. warships and aircraft have also been ordered to fire immediately on Chinese territory if "necessary".

It can be seen from the comments in American newspapers that if the United States holds talks with the People's Republic of China, the United States intends to adopt the same position that previously led to the breakdown of the Sino-American ambassadorial talks in Geneva. Roberts, a commentator for the "Washington Post and Times Herald," wrote that the United States intends to continue to insist that China abandon the use of force in the Taiwan Strait area, that is, to have China voluntarily recognize the United States' occupation of Taiwan and the coastal islands, which are the legitimate territories of the People's Republic of China. Some commentators wrote plainly that the possible Sino-American talks will not make any decisions, and pointed out that this is because the U.S. position "remains unchanged".

### 美国报纸透露内情  美国并无恢复会谈诚意

    美国报纸透露内情
　　美国并无恢复会谈诚意
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿8日讯：从美国报纸的评论看，白宫关于美国“同意”恢复中美会谈的声明，并没有多大诚意，而是打算重施拖延策略和使中国人民放松警惕。
    美国报纸用大字标题报道，在白宫发表关于美国“准备立即”恢复中美大使级会谈问题的声明的第二天，美国海军舰只就侵犯中华人民共和国的领海，保护蒋介石分子的军用运输船只开往金门岛。据美国一些通讯社报道，美国和蒋介石的侦察机7日曾经在中华人民共和国的沿海一带进行“联合”飞行。合众国际社公开宣称，五角大楼发言人8日“不理睬”中华人民共和国政府对美国武装部队侵犯中国领海的警告，扬言美国第七舰队对蒋介石船只“将继续实行护航”。这个被合众国际社称为“洞悉美国远东军事计划”的五角大楼官方发言人说，只要美国军方认为这种“护航必须继续多久，它就继续多久”。
    据美国报纸报道，美国军舰和飞机还得到命令在“必要”的情况下立即向中国领土开火。
    从美国报纸的评论中可以看出，如果美国同中华人民共和国举行会谈的话，美国在会谈中还是打算采取它以前使日内瓦中美两国大使级会谈陷于破裂的那种立场。“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”评论员罗伯茨写道，美国打算仍旧坚持要中国放弃在台湾海峡地区使用武力的原则，也就是要中国自愿地承认美国对中华人民共和国的合法领土台湾和沿海岛屿的占领。有些评论员明白写道，可能举行的中美会谈不会作出什么决定，并且指出，这是因为美国的立场“不变”的缘故。
