    Establishing People's Communes Promotes Production; Indigenous Fertilizer Blooms Everywhere
    (Our Dispatch) An upsurge in the mass production of indigenous fertilizer has swept across most of the country's rural areas. Recently, especially during the movement to establish communes, thousands upon thousands of indigenous fertilizer plants, bacterial fertilizer plants, and granular fertilizer plants have sprung up every day across the nation. According to incomplete statistics from fifteen cities and counties, including Hebei and Zhejiang, over 1.99 million indigenous fertilizer plants have already been built, producing over 40 million tons of indigenous fertilizer. On average, three jin of indigenous fertilizer has the same effect as one jin of manufactured fertilizer, equivalent to over 10 million tons of manufactured fertilizer.
    The regions with better development of indigenous fertilizer production include Hebei, Zhejiang, Anhui, Gansu, Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Jilin, and other provinces and regions. In Hebei's rural areas, over 700,000 indigenous fertilizer plants have been built, producing 58.5 billion jin of indigenous fertilizer. In Zhejiang Province, there are now an average of seventy indigenous fertilizer plants in each township, producing three million tons in the past two months. In Jilin Province, the fertilizer plants run by young people alone number 40,000, with a daily output of 80,000 tons, exceeding the daily output of the Jilin Chemical Industrial Zone Fertilizer Plant by ten times.
    Even in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which previously lacked the habit of fertilization, statistics from nine counties and banners show that over 5,000 indigenous fertilizer plants have been established, producing over 50 million jin of indigenous fertilizer. In areas where indigenous fertilizer production was well developed this summer, topdressing of crops was more timely. After the rural areas of Yichang Special District in Hubei Province universally produced indigenous fertilizer, there was not a single neglected field in the entire district.
    The characteristics of the indigenous fertilizer production movement are that it blooms everywhere, uses a wide variety of raw materials, and employs diverse methods. In coastal areas, the slogan is to bring marine fertilizer onto the land, with fish, shellfish, algae, and seawater all serving as raw materials. In Wendeng County, Shandong Province, over 10 million jin of indigenous fertilizer were produced from marine raw materials in half a month. Weathered stone, alum stone, coal, phosphate rock from the mountains, peat, alkaline soil from the plains, and slag from industrial and mining areas have all become good raw materials for manufacturing indigenous fertilizer. In many places, nitrogen fertilizer is even extracted from smoke. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently over a thousand types of indigenous fertilizer produced by the masses in various regions. Even relatively advanced ammonium bicarbonate, defluorinated phosphate fertilizer, calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, ferrous sulfate, and various bacterial fertilizers are being manufactured by the masses using indigenous methods. According to relevant departments' testing, although the fertilizer effect of indigenous fertilizer is not as good as that of manufactured fertilizer, it is generally five to ten times higher than that of natural fertilizer. The bittern potassium-magnesium fertilizer produced by indigenous methods in Shandong Province contains up to 33.7% magnesium sulfate. The mixed fertilizer made from soot, fish salt, and fish water in Guangdong Province has a fertilizer effect equivalent to 70% of imported fertilizer powder. Moreover, the cost is very low. The nitrogen-fixing bacteria fertilizer made from corn flour, white sugar, and garden soil in Shandong Province only costs two fen per mu of fertilizer.
    In order to ensure sufficient base fertilizer for this year's autumn wheat planting and guarantee a leap in wheat production next year, the scale of manure accumulation and composting is also very large in various regions, in addition to the large-scale production of indigenous fertilizer.

### 建立人民公社推动了生产  土制化肥遍地开花

    建立人民公社推动了生产
    土制化肥遍地开花
    本报讯　土制化肥已在全国大部农村形成了群众性的热潮。最近一个时期，特别是在办公社的运动中，全国每天都有千百个土化肥厂、细菌肥料厂、颗粒肥料厂出现。据河北、浙江等十五个市县的不完全统计，已经建成土化肥厂一百九十九万多个，已经生产了四千多万吨土化肥。平均三斤土化肥的肥效可顶一斤机制化肥，即相当于一千几百万吨机制化肥。
    土制化肥开展较好的地区有河北、浙江、安徽、甘肃、四川、广东、广西、贵州、吉林等省区。河北农村已建土化肥厂达七十多万个，制成土化肥五百八十五亿斤。浙江省现在平均每个乡都有七十个土化肥厂，两个月来生产了三百万吨。吉林全省仅青年人办的化肥厂就有四万个，每天产量八万吨，超过了吉林化工区肥料厂日产量的十倍。
    就连过去没有施肥习惯的内蒙古自治区，据九个县、旗的统计也建立了五千多个土化肥厂，生产土化肥五千多万斤。今年夏季土制化肥开展较好的地区，农作物的追肥就比较及时。湖北省宜昌专区农村普遍制土化肥后，全专区没有一块落后田。
    制土化肥运动的特点是遍地开花，原料多种多样，办法也多种多样。沿海地区的口号是让海肥上陆，海里的鱼、贝、藻、海水都是原料。山东文登县半个月就用海里原料制出了一千多万斤土化肥。山上的风化石、矾石、煤炭、磷灰石，平原的泥炭、碱土以及工矿区的矿渣等都成了制造土化肥的好原料。不少地方从烟中还取出了氮肥。据不完全统计，目前各地群众造的土化肥有千种以上。就连较高级的碳酸氢铵、脱氟磷肥、钙镁磷肥、硫酸亚铁和各种细菌肥料，群众也都用土办法制造出来了。据有关部门检验，各地土制化肥肥效虽不如机制化肥，但一般都比自然肥料高五倍到十倍。山东省用土办法造出的盐卤钾镁肥，含硫酸镁达33.7％。广东省用烟灰、鱼盐、鱼水制成的混合肥料，肥效相当于进口肥田粉的70％。而且成本很低，山东省用玉米粉、白糖、菜园土制成的固氮菌肥料，一亩地用的肥料只需要两分钱。
    为了使今年秋种小麦有充足的底肥，保证明年小麦产量翻身，现在各地除大搞土化肥外，积肥、沤肥的规模也很大。
