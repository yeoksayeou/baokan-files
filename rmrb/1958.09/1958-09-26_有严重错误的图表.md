    Chart with Serious Errors
    In the "Long Live High Speed" special page on the September 15th People's Daily, the figures for the average annual track-laying mileage listed in the railway construction speed chart contain major errors. The first item, which states that 25,700 kilometers were built in the old China over 81 years, gives an annual average of 3,173 kilometers when it should be 317.3 kilometers. The second item, which states that 6,108 kilometers were built from 1950-57, gives an annual average of 7,635 kilometers when it should be 763.5 kilometers. The third item, 1,476 kilometers built in 1958, was originally the most built, but because the above two numbers are wrong, people not only cannot understand the high-speed development of China's railway construction, but on the contrary, feel that this year's construction speed is half as slow as the construction speed during the Qing Dynasty and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's rule. This is a serious political error. It is hoped that the relevant editors will pay more attention in the future so as to avoid adverse effects.

    Editor's note: Dozens of similar letters have been received. The readers' criticism is correct. In addition to the correction already made on the 16th, the newspaper's editorial department is seriously dealing with the dereliction of duty of the relevant staff regarding this error.

    有严重错误的图表
    9月15日人民日报第六版“高速度万岁”的专页中，铁路建设速度一图表所列每年平均铺轨里程的数字有很大错误。第一项旧中国八十一年共修建25，700公里，每年平均数应是317.3公里，误为3，173公里。第二项1950—57年共修建6，108公里，每年平均数应是763.5公里，误为7，635公里。第三项1958年修建1，476公里，本来是修建最多的，但因为上列两个数字有错，使人看来不仅不能了解我国铁路建设高速度发展的情况，相反却感到今年的建设速度，比之清朝以及蒋介石匪帮统治时期的建设速度都慢了一半。这是严重的政治性错误。希望有关编辑同志今后能多多注意，以免造成不良的影响。
