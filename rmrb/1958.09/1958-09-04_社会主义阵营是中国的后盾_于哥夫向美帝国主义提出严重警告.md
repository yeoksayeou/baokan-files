Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 3rd - Bulgarian Council of Ministers Chairman Yugov condemned the US imperialists' aggressive armed provocations against China at a reception hosted by the Vietnamese Ambassador to Bulgaria on the evening of September 2nd to celebrate Vietnam's National Day.

Yugov emphasized that the imperialists are trying every possible means to keep the world in a state of tension, pushing it to the brink of war. Their current provocations against the People's Republic of China have aroused the anger of the whole world. They are clamoring wildly in the Far East, vainly attempting to divert international public opinion and cover up their disastrous defeat in the Middle East. Yugov said that their provocations do not demonstrate their strength, but only their weakness, their fear of the people of all countries who are fighting for peace, independence, and socialism.

In his speech, Yugov reminded the imperialists to take note when provoking the People's Republic of China: Behind the Chinese people stand the powerful Soviet Union, the entire socialist camp, and all peace-loving humanity.

　　社会主义阵营是中国的后盾
    于哥夫向美帝国主义提出严重警告
    新华社索非亚3日电　保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫在越南驻保加利亚大使9月2日晚间举行的庆祝越南国庆招待会上谴责美国帝国主义者对中国的侵略性的武装挑衅。
    于哥夫着重指出，帝国主义者千方百计地使世界处于紧张状态，把世界推向战争边缘。他们目前向人民中国进行的挑衅，引起了全世界的愤怒。它们在远东大肆叫嚣，妄想转移国际舆论的注意力，掩盖它们在中东的惨败。于哥夫说，它们的挑衅并不能说明它们的强大，而只能说明它们的软弱，说明它们害怕那些为和平、独立和社会主义而斗争的各国人民。
    于哥夫在讲话中提醒帝国主义者在对中华人民共和国挑衅时注意：在中国人民的背后有强大的苏联、整个社会主义阵营和整个爱好和平的人类。
