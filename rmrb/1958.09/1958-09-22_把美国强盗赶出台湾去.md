Drive the American Robbers Out of Taiwan!
Xiao San

A pack of ferocious American jackals scurry to the four corners of the Earth. Today, they kill and set fires here. Tomorrow, they stir up trouble there. They push humanity to the brink of war. They make the situation extremely tense. -- This is their specialty!

From the Baltic Sea to the East and South China Seas, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, they want to form a ring around China, around the Soviet Union... They call this a "defensive chain." Bah, to hell with you! You Americans are over ten thousand kilometers away. What kind of "defense" are you doing on our sacred territory of Taiwan?! When did we ever send a soldier to defend your Long Island, Rhode Island, or areas near the Mississippi and San Francisco?

Taiwan is a province, an island, of our country. You have occupied it for nine years. Isn't this outright robbery? Eliminating the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and liberating Taiwan is entirely our own internal affair. What business is it of you Americans?! You want to use Jinmen and Mazu as springboards for attack, to bring back that old dog to bite people again. That will only lead you and it to your deaths!

You call your aggression "defense," and our defense "aggression." The logic of a robber is always sophistry, but have you heard what Mao Zedong said: your "defensive chains" are the nooses around your own necks. You are deploying troops and sending generals, provoking us like madmen, shipping bullfighter-style Nike missiles to Taiwan, but have you heard what Khrushchev said: if you launch such an attack against us, you will receive a counterattack with the same weapons!

We have always loved peace, but we are never afraid of war! To fight to defend our great motherland, to fight to resist aggression and defend peace, six hundred million, eight hundred million, nine hundred million, a billion people, all, every one of us, stand on the front lines, unafraid of any sacrifice!

American robbers: if you don't roll back home yourselves, we are determined to drive you out!

    把美国强盗赶出台湾去
    萧三一群凶恶的美国豺狼窜到地球的四面八方。今天在这里杀人放火。明天在那儿兴风作浪。把人类推到战争边缘。把局势弄得异常紧张。——它们专干这一行！从波罗的海到东海南海从大西洋到太平洋想对中国、对苏联……形成一个包围圈，——管这叫“防御锁链”。呸，见你的鬼！你美国在一万多公里以外，在我国神圣的领土台湾要你来“防御”个什么？！我们几时派过一兵一卒去防御你们的长岛、罗得岛，或者靠近密西西比和旧金山？台湾是我国的一个省，一个岛。你侵占它有了九年之久，这不是道道地地的强盗？消灭卖国贼蒋介石，解放台湾，完全是咱们自己的内政，试问这干你美国人什么事？！你想把持金门马祖作跳板来进攻，想牵回那条老狗来再咬人，那只是你和它一同来送死！你把自己的侵略叫“防御”，把我们的防御叫“侵略”，强盗逻辑总是强词夺理，但你可曾听见毛泽东说的：你的这些“防御锁链”就是套在自己脖子上的绞索。你调兵遣将，疯狂挑衅，什么斗牛士式，奈克式导弹，都运到台湾，但你可曾听见赫鲁晓夫说的：你如对我们发动这种进攻，你将得到同样武器的反击！我们素来热爱和平，但也决不害怕战争！为保卫伟大祖国而战，为反抗侵略保卫和平而战，六亿、八亿、九亿、十亿人民全体、每个都站在最前线，不怕任何牺牲！美国强盗：你如不自己滚回家去，我们决定把你赶出去！
