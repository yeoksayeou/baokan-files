　　Spreading Iron Smelting Technology at the Fastest Speed
　　Hubei Technical Guidance Group Combines Production with Technician Training
    Shanxi and Shantou "Medical Teams" Cure Difficult Cases
    Minfeng Boiler Factory and Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Send People for Consultations
    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 31st) Since its establishment, the Hubei Provincial Technical Guidance Group has played a huge role in the large-scale development of the steel industry by adopting methods that combine theory with practice and training with production.
    The Hubei Provincial Technical Guidance Group is composed of more than 300 people, including teachers and students from universities and colleges, technicians from large factories, and engineers. A portion of cadres with high political awareness and strong organizational skills serve as political leaders. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the Guidance Group has two tasks: first, to help solve a series of technical problems in steel production and equipment manufacturing, repair, and testing; second, to impart basic knowledge and train a large number of technical personnel while solving specific problems.
    After the Technical Guidance Groups went down to the local levels, they first focused on the technical problem of earthen furnaces not producing iron. For example, the Yichang Prefecture Guidance Group, led by engineer Tang Liwu, first built two experimental furnaces in Yichang City, solving the problem of earthen blast furnaces not separating slag and iron and not producing iron. This not only promoted the successive production of more than 20 earthen blast furnaces in the city, but also compiled the explored laws of earthen furnace iron smelting into a technical report with theory and practice, which was lectured at the Yichang Prefecture on-site conference. The vast majority of the 304 participants in the on-site conference mastered iron smelting technology.
    In addition to solving iron smelting technical problems, the Guidance Group also solved technical problems in various aspects of steel production. For example, the Xiaogan Prefecture Guidance Group helped four counties establish testing institutions and trained 33 apprentices to preliminarily learn the analysis of iron ore, limestone, refractory materials, and coke.
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Recently, a number of "Steel Mobile Medical Teams" have appeared in various parts of Shanxi Province, specializing in treating "indigestion" in small steelmaking furnaces and iron smelting furnaces.
    These "Steel Medical Teams" are organized by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Metallurgical Industry, with the participation of technicians and technical personnel from units such as Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Yangquan Iron Plant, and Guxian Iron Plant.
    The newly built Wangjiayuan Iron Plant in Datong had a small blast furnace with a volume of 13 cubic meters, which was completed on July 1st but had been unable to produce iron. Recently, the "Medical Team" sent by Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant studied the situation and found that the brick seams of this small blast furnace were not properly constructed, causing gas leakage; its tapping hole was far from the tuyere, so the wind could not reach it, and the slag could not be completely discharged; the raw materials were not tested, and the proportion of ingredients was inappropriate. According to the above symptoms, the "Medical Team" immediately worked with the workers to improve the equipment and guide the operation, so that the small blast furnace quickly returned to normal production. The "Medical Team" sent to Xinxian Iron and Steel Plant also trained 16 furnace operators and 15 charging workers for the factory in a very short period of time.
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The Shantou Prefectural Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently transferred metallurgical technicians and indigenous experts with experience in furnace construction and iron smelting to form three steel technology medical teams to help treat the diseases of earthen blast furnaces and train iron smelting technical forces in various places.
    These three steel technology medical teams have already started working at three points: Fuda in Meixian, Hengjiang in Jieyang, and Fengxi in Chao'an. The small blast furnace in Hengjiang Township, Jieyang, with a daily output of one ton, could not produce molten iron. The medical team went to the site to operate and study the source of the disease and found that the reasons for not being able to produce iron were mainly defects in furnace construction and batching. The medical team then fought hard there for three days, helping them improve the furnace and batching work, and only left after the molten iron flowed smoothly from the small blast furnace.
    After these three points were helped by the medical team to solve technical problems and the molten iron flowed smoothly, the local county party committees all held on-site meetings, where the medical team introduced on-site technical operations, summarized experiences, and immediately promoted them in an all-round way.
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Suzhou Minfeng Boiler Factory, which has been relatively successful and experienced in indigenous iron smelting, has become a school for indigenous iron smelting and a hospital for treating diseases of earthen blast furnaces.
    Up to now, the factory's employees have used their spare time to build more than 200 earthen blast furnaces for various units. At the same time, it has run three training courses, training more than 1,100 furnace construction and operation workers for counties in Suzhou Prefecture and Suzhou City.
    After earthen blast furnaces bloomed all over the place, diagnosing and treating earthen blast furnace diseases has become a regular job for the workers of Minfeng Boiler Factory. Every day after work, the furnace workers wait for the factory to assign consultation tasks. In the 19 days of August, they made more than 170 consultations and cured the diseases of earthen blast furnaces for nearly 100 units.
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The "External Reception Group" specially established by the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology vigorously supports the construction of small blast furnaces in various places and treats various "diseases" of small blast furnaces. In the past two months, this group has helped iron smelting plants in Jixian, Zhangjiakou, and Tangshan in Hebei, Zibo and Linyi in Shandong, as well as Zhoukoudian, Mentougou, and Shahe in Beijing, solve many problems with small blast furnaces not producing iron and the construction of small blast furnaces.
    Now the college has organized 88 students to go to Miyun, Huairou and other places to help solve the problem of iron extraction from small blast furnaces. Fourth-year students majoring in iron smelting, combined with their internship tasks, also went to the iron smelting plants in Tangshan and Zhangjiakou to undertake the design, construction, and improvement of production indicators for more than 30 small blast furnaces.

　　用最快的速度传播炼铁技术
　　湖北技术辅导团结合生产培养技工
    山西、汕头“医疗队”包治疑难病症
    民丰锅厂、北京钢铁学院派人出诊
    本报武汉31日电　湖北省技术辅导团成立以来，采取理论联系实际、训练结合生产的办法，在大办钢铁工业中起了巨大作用。
    湖北省的技术辅导团，是由大专学校教员、学生、大厂技工、工程师共三百多人组成的。一部分政治水平较高、组织能力较强的干部担任政治领导。根据省委的指示，辅导团任务有二：第一，帮助解决钢铁生产和设备制造、修理以及化验等一系列的技术问题。第二，在解决具体问题中传授基本知识，培训大批技术力量。
    技术辅导团分头下去以后，首先针对土炉不出铁这一技术难题开展了工作。例如，宜昌专区辅导小组，以汤力武工程师为首先在宜昌市搞了两个试验炉，解决了土高炉渣铁不分、出渣不出铁的问题，不但推动该市二十多部土高炉相继投入生产，而且将摸索出的土炉炼铁规律写成一篇有理论有实际的技术报告，在宜昌专区的现场会议上进行了讲授。参加现场会议的三百零四人绝大部分掌握了炼铁的技术。
    除解决炼铁技术问题外，辅导团还多方面解决了办钢铁中的技术难题。如孝感专区辅导小组帮助四个县建立了化验机构，并培养三十三名学徒初步学会了铁矿石、石灰石、耐火材料、焦炭的化验分析。
    据新华社讯　山西省各地最近出现了一批“钢铁巡回医疗队”，专治小型炼钢炉和炼铁炉的“消化不良症”。
    这批“钢铁医疗队”是由山西省冶金工业厅组织的，参加的有太原钢铁厂、阳泉铁厂、故县铁厂等单位的技术工人和技术人员。
    新建大同王家园铁厂一座十三立方公尺的小高炉在7月1日建成以后，一直不能出铁；最近太原钢铁厂派去“医疗队”研究以后，发现这座小高炉的砖缝没搞好，漏煤气；它的出铁口离风口远，风吹不到，渣流不尽；原料未经化验，成分比例不当。“医疗队”根据以上的病症，立即同工人一起改进设备，并且指导操作，使小高炉很快转入正常生产。派到忻县钢铁厂的“医疗队”，还在很短的时间内为这个厂培养了炉前工十六人，装料工十五人。
    据新华社讯　中共汕头地委最近抽调冶金技术人员和有建炉、炼铁经验的土专家组成三个钢铁技术医疗队，到各地帮助治疗土高炉的病症和培养炼铁技术力量。
    这三个钢铁技术医疗队已经在梅县的扶大、揭阳的横江、潮安的枫溪三个点开展工作。揭阳横江乡日产一吨的小高炉出不了铁水，医疗队到现场操作研究病源，发现不能出铁的原因主要是建炉和配料两方面有缺点。医疗队便在那里苦战三天，帮助他们改进了炉子和配料工作，直到那座小高炉铁水畅流以后才离开。
    这三个点经医疗队帮助解决了技术问题，铁水畅流以后，当地县委都召开了现场会议，医疗队作现场技术操作的介绍，总结经验，立即全面推广。
    据新华社讯　土法炼铁搞得比较成功并富有经验的苏州民丰锅厂，已成了土法炼铁的学校和医治土高炉病的医院。
    到目前为止，这个厂的职工已经利用空余时间为各单位建造了两百多只土高炉。同时，开办了三期训练班，为苏州专区各县和苏州市培养了建炉和操作工人一千一百多人。
    土高炉遍地开花以后，出诊医治土高炉病已成为民丰锅厂工人的经常工作。炉工们每天一下班就等待厂部分配出诊任务。8月份的十九天中，他们共出诊一百七十多次，为近百个单位医治好了土高炉病。
    据新华社讯　北京钢铁工业学院专门成立的“对外接待组”，大力支援各地小高炉的建设，医治小高炉的各种“疾病”。两个多月来，这个组已经帮助河北的蓟县、张家口、唐山，山东的淄博、临沂，以及北京的周口店、门头沟、沙河等地的炼铁厂解决了许多小高炉不出铁和建设小高炉的问题。
    现在学院已组织八十八个学生去密云、怀柔等地帮助解决小高炉的出铁问题。炼铁专业四年级学生还结合实习任务，去唐山、张家口的炼铁厂担任三十多个小高炉的设计、建设和改进高炉生产指标的工作。
