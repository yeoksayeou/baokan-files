    Bi-Weekly Agricultural Situation
    "White Dew" (September 8) – "Autumn Equinox" (September 23)
    Around the "Autumn Equinox" is the suitable period for sowing winter wheat in most parts of northern China. In the past half month, many regions have continued to make concentrated efforts to deeply plow wheat fields. By mid-September, provinces and cities such as Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Beijing had deeply plowed more than 30% of the planned area for deep plowing of wheat fields. By September 23, Shandong Province had sown nearly one million mu of winter wheat.
    Areas in the south that grow winter wheat and rapeseed are also actively carrying out specific preparatory work such as plowing, accumulating fertilizer, and preparing seeds.
    During this period, all regions continued to carry out the autumn harvest intensely. A shortage of labor is a relatively common problem in various regions this year, and a few regions have experienced rough harvesting as a result.
    The period between "White Dew" and "Autumn Equinox" is the peak season for cotton boll opening. People's communes and agricultural cooperatives in cotton-growing areas have invested in a high tide of cotton picking. This year's cotton is characterized by: universal bumper harvests and high increases in production. Nanyang Prefecture in Henan, where the average yield of ginned cotton was more than 30 jin per mu last year, has now become a prefecture with 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Shaanxi Province will become a province with 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In order to promote early maturity of cotton, strive for higher yields, and improve the quality of cotton, many cotton-growing areas have generally managed to manage while picking cotton.
    By late September, the intermediate rice in the south had basically been harvested. The first crop of late rice has already headed, and the double-cropping late rice is in the booting stage. With the vigorous prevention and control by the masses, the development of rice blast in some areas has been suppressed. The problem of lodging in late rice has begun to appear in some areas, which has attracted attention. Jinjiang and Putian in Fujian have adopted methods such as: applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, digging drainage ditches, adding soil and sand, and erecting frames and ropes to prevent and rescue. Hunan Province has also promoted the management experience of "hardening the skin by exposing the roots to the sun and irrigating with moisture" from Liling County.
    In the past half month, fruits such as pears, grapes, apples, and bananas have matured one after another. The situation in various regions shows that this year's fruit harvest is generally better than last year's.

    半月农情
    “白露”（9月8日）——“秋分”（9月23日）
    “秋分”前后正是我国北方大部地区播种冬麦的适宜期间，不少地区在这半个月继续突击深翻麦地。陕西、山西、河南、北京等省、市，到9月中旬已深耕了占计划深耕面积的30％以上麦田。山东省各地到9月23日已播种冬麦近一百万亩。
    南方种植冬麦、油菜的地区，也在积极进行翻地、积肥、备种等具体准备工作。
    在这个阶段里，各地继续紧张地进行秋收。劳力不够用是今年各地比较普遍的问题，少数地区并因此而有收割粗糙的现象。
    “白露”“秋分”间，正是棉花吐絮盛期。棉区的人民公社、农业社都投入了收摘棉花的高潮。今年棉花的特点是：丰收普遍，增产幅度高。去年平均亩产皮棉三十多斤的河南南阳专区，今年一跃而成为百斤皮棉专区。陕西省将成为百斤皮棉省。许多棉区为了促使棉花早熟，争取更高的产量和提高棉花质量，普遍作到了边收花、边管理。
    到9月下旬，南方地区的中稻已基本收获完了。一季晚稻已经抽穗，双季晚稻正在孕穗。在群众大力防治下，一些地区稻热病的发展被抑止住了。部分地区开始出现晚稻的倒伏问题，已引起注意。福建晋江、莆田等地采取了：施磷钾肥料，挖排水沟，添土加沙，搭架拉绳等办法来防止和抢救。湖南省还推广了醴陵县的“硬皮晒脚、湿润灌溉”的管理经验。
    这半个月，梨、葡萄、苹果、香蕉等水果相继成熟。各地情况表明，今年水果收成普遍优于去年。
