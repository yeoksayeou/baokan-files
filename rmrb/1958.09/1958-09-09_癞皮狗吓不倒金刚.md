　　That paper tiger, the United States, suddenly seems to have eaten bear heart and leopard guts, and has actually further provoked the Chinese people. On the morning of September 4, Dulles and Eisenhower held some kind of meeting, and then Dulles barked wildly (called a "statement"). This "statement" said a lot of messy things, but in general, it had only one meaning, which was to expand the aggression against China to China's inland sea islands—Jinmen, Mazu, and many other coastal islands of our country.

　　What a bold and reckless madman! Doesn't even pee on himself to see what he looks like before running to the Chinese people to act like a hero.

　　Tell Dulles that the Chinese people know what kind of stuff Dulles, Eisenhower, and the like are made of. They are the heads of a government that, on the one hand, uses atomic bombs to blackmail everywhere, talks big, scares people, and sends troops everywhere to stir up trouble and carry out aggression. On the other hand, it organizes specialized scientific teams to study how to surrender to others more profitably. Its big talk is exposed everywhere, and it is unanimously cursed by the people everywhere. Its acts of aggression are running into walls everywhere, even in "small countries" that seem insignificant to them, they are getting bruised and battered. Such a bunch of stupid, flimsy, and rotten guys actually came to dig earth on the head of the Chinese people, this Grand Duke.

　　The Chinese people are not cowards. They can't be defeated by fighting, let alone be scared. Seven or eight years ago, the Chinese people in Korea did not take the sixteen-nation coalition of invading bandits gathered by the Americans seriously. As a result of the contest, it was not we who were defeated. Now, we don't even take this lone ghost, the United States, seriously. If we must compete, then competing is not out of the question. The Chinese people love peace, but they have not drunk a peace-inducing drug with anesthesia in it. If anyone insists on putting war on our heads, we will show them what we are made of. We Chinese people are serious about our work. If we don't fight, we won't fight, but if we do, we will fight thoroughly. We will never stop until the aggressors are eliminated. We will never tolerate others defecating at our doorstep. The American devils better roll away as soon as possible, otherwise, they will not get any good rewards.

　　As for the various excuses fabricated by Dulles for expanding aggression against our country, they are all nonsense and not worth refuting. What do you mean that the territory occupied by the Kuomintang is not allowed to be liberated by the Chinese people? What do you mean that if the Chinese people want to liberate their own territories, it is "using armed forces to seize new territories," and therefore it is "aggression" and the United States has the right to carry out armed intervention, etc.? This is really a blatant lie and utter nonsense. Who doesn't know that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times? The Chinese people have not yet liberated these territories only because of the armed aggression and blatant interference of the American thieves. How can the facts be reversed? Isn't the entire China liberated by the Chinese people from the Chiang Kai-shek group? Who dares to say that this is "aggression" against the Chiang Kai-shek group? Does it mean that completing a small part of the unfinished business has become aggression instead?

　　In the eyes of the Chinese people, the Chiang Kai-shek group itself should not exist. Sooner or later, the Chinese people will completely remove this pile of garbage in Taiwan, just like sweeping away all the historical garbage on the mainland. Dulles and his ilk like this pile of garbage, because it is more conducive to their aggression against the Chinese people. We cannot allow this pile of garbage that harms us to accumulate there for a long time because of the needs of the American devils.

　　What do you mean that our territory, Taiwan, and the islands of Jinmen and Mazu are part of the chain of islands in the Western Pacific in the hands of the United States, and that it is "extremely important" to the American aggressor group, so it can be occupied by the United States and we are not allowed to liberate it? Does it mean that if we see that American factories, land, steel, and grain are "extremely important" to us, we can take them as we please, and when the Americans try to take these things back, we can say that this is the Americans invading us? Isn't Dulles's economic theory just pure banditry? But we Chinese people are the least afraid of bandits.

　　Dulles and Eisenhower are relying on these male prostitutes and female thieves' reasons to "sincerely hope" that we will not liberate our own territory? Then, we say that this "hope" is useless, no matter how "sincere" you are? We will liberate our territory whenever we want to, and we will use whatever method we want to. No outsider has the right to interfere. Anyone who wants to bring bad luck on themselves can try it. Do you want us to "no longer learn to despise" the so-called "principles" of the United States as we did in Korea? Then, we say that we now despise these "principles" even more than we did then. Moreover, these "principles" of the American devils make people all over the world nauseous.

　　It is possible to negotiate with us to resolve the disputes in the Taiwan region, but the American devils are simply not worthy to talk about "civilization." Why bother to waste these originally beautiful words? As for wanting to use negotiations to interfere in our internal affairs and hinder us from liberating our own territory, that is completely a dream. If you talk about negotiations but secretly stab us in the back, we are even less afraid. We are always prepared.

　　Scabby dog, bark as much as you like. We would like to hear what else you can bark out. Anyway, the Vajra-like Chinese people will never be scared.

　　癞皮狗吓不倒金刚
    阮延顺
    美国这只纸老虎，忽然像是吃了熊心、豹子胆，居然进一步向中国人挑衅起来。9月4日上午，杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔举行了一个什么会议，接着杜勒斯便狂吠了一通（叫作什么声明），这个“声明”乱七八糟地说了一大堆，但总起来只有一个意思，这就是要把对中国的侵略扩大到中国的内海岛屿——金门、马祖等我国许多沿海岛屿上来。
    好一个胆大妄为的狂徒！不先尿泡尿来照一照自己是个什么样子，就跑到中国人面前充起好汉来了。
    告诉杜勒斯吧，中国人是知道杜勒斯艾森豪威尔之流是什么货色。他们是这样一个政府的首脑，这个政府，一方面用原子弹到处实行讹诈，说大话，吓唬人，派遣军队到处惹是生非，进行侵略。另一方面又组织专门科学班子研究如何向别人投降才更合算，它的大话到处被揭穿，到处遭到人民的同声咒骂。它的侵略行为到处碰壁，甚至在他们看来是微不足道的“小小国家”中也要被碰得鼻青脸肿。就是这样一班蠢笨、稀松不堪的臭家伙，竟然跑到中国人民这样的太岁头上动土来了。
    中国人并不是胆小鬼，中国人打都打不倒，吓就更吓不倒。七八年前，中国人在朝鲜并没有把美国人纠集的十六国合伙的侵略匪帮看在眼里，较量的结果，拜下风的并不是我们，如今，就更不把美国这个孤鬼看在眼里。一定要较量，就较量较量也未尝不可。中国人热爱和平，但并没有喝了放了蒙汗药的和平迷魂汤。谁要是硬把战争放在我们头上，我们就打出个样子来给他看看。我们中国人办事认真，不打则已，打就要打个彻底，不消灭侵略者，就决不罢休。我们绝不能容忍别人堵住我们的门口拉屎，美国鬼趁早滚远一点，不然，是得不到什么好报应的。
    至于杜勒斯胡诌出来的扩大对我国侵略的那种种借口，都是些胡说八道，不值一驳。说什么国民党盘踞着的领土，就不允许中国人民去解放？说什么中国人民要去解放自己的这些领土，就是“使用武装力量夺取新的领土”，因而便是“侵略”美国就有权力来进行武装干涉等等。这真是漫天大谎，狗屁不通。谁不知道台湾和澎湖列岛自古以来就是中国的领土，中国人民至今还没有把这些领土解放，只是由于美国贼的武装侵略和横加干涉，事实岂容颠倒。难道整个中国都不是中国人民从蒋介石集团手中解放出来的吗？谁敢说我们这是对于蒋介石集团的“侵略”？难道完成一小部分未竟事业时，反倒成了侵略了不成。
    在我们中国人民看来，蒋介石集团本身就不应该存在。中国人民迟早是要像在大陆上清扫一切历史垃圾那样，把在台湾的这堆垃圾彻底清除掉。杜勒斯之流的人是喜欢这堆垃圾的，那是因为这更有利于它对中国人民的侵略，我们可不能因了美国佬的这种需要，就让这堆危害自己的垃圾长期的堆积在那里。
    说什么我们的领土台湾和金门马祖等岛是美国手里的西太平洋岛屿锁链的一部分，它对美国侵略集团说来，“是极其重要的”，因此便可以由美国霸占，而不允许我们去解放？难道我们看到美国的工厂、土地、钢材、粮食对我们说来“是极其重要的”，我们就可以随便拿来，而且美国人企图收回这些东西的时候，我们就能说这是美国人侵略我们吗？杜勒斯的这套治财经，岂不正是地地道道的强盗主义，但我们中国人偏偏是最不怕强盗的。
    杜勒斯、艾森豪威尔就是凭了这些男盗女娼的理由来“真诚地希望”我们不要去解放自己的领土吗？那末，我们说这“希望”屁事不顶，不管你是如何“真诚”？我们的领土，我们要什么时候解放就什么时候解放，要用什么方法解放就用什么方法解放，任何外人都没有权力干涉。谁要想自找倒霉就来试一试看。要我们“不会再学在朝鲜表现的那样蔑视”美国的这些所谓“原则”吗？那末，我们说现在比那时更为蔑视这种“原则”了。而且，美国佬的这些“原则”使全世界人民都闻之作呕。
    希望同我们进行谈判来解决台湾地区的争端是可以的，但美国佬根本不配谈什么“文明”，何苦来白白地糟踏这些原来是美好的字眼呢？至于想用谈判来干涉我们的内政，阻碍我们解放自己的领土，那完全是梦想，如果口说谈判，暗下毒手，我们就更不怕，我们是时刻准备着的。
    癞皮狗你尽管吠吧，我们倒想听听还能吠出些什么名堂来，反正金刚般的中国人是永也吓不倒的。
