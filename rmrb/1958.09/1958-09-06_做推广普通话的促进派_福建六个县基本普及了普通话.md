Be Promoters of Popularizing Putonghua
Fujian's Six Counties Basically Popularized Putonghua

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 5th: In Fujian Province, where dialects are complex, many areas have launched a province-wide upsurge in learning Putonghua. By the end of August, six counties in the province, including Datian, Shunchang, Yunxiao, Putian, Jianyang, and Longxi, had basically popularized Putonghua. In these counties, the number of people who can understand and speak Putonghua has reached more than 85% of the total number of young and middle-aged people and teenagers, and many elderly people have also learned a part of Putonghua. In some mountainous areas of Fujian Province with inconvenient transportation, a single township has several completely different languages, which has caused many difficulties for work. With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the masses' demands for learning Putonghua have become even more urgent. In the work of popularizing Putonghua, the local Party committees are headed by secretaries, closely combining it with production, closely relying on the masses, cultivating typical examples to establish banners, and launching a mass movement of people teaching people in conjunction with literacy campaigns. In addition to organizing propaganda teams to go to the countryside to promote Putonghua, Longxi and other counties have also set up Putonghua teaching stations in various townships, with cadres, workers, and shop assistants serving as teachers, and students teaching people to speak at intersections, thus forming a new atmosphere in a short period of time where everyone learns Putonghua and Putonghua is spoken everywhere.

In areas where Putonghua has been popularized, it is easier for people to communicate ideas and exchange feelings. The Party's policies and new agricultural technologies can be quickly implemented among the masses, inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the masses.

From August 26th to 30th, the Fujian Provincial Department of Education held a provincial on-site conference on popularizing Putonghua in Datian County, summarizing the experience of Fujian Province in popularizing Putonghua. More than 70 representatives from various counties in the province visited the site, conducted interviews in the countryside, exchanged experiences with each other, broke the mysterious view of popularizing Putonghua, and enhanced their confidence. Judging from the experience summarized at this conference, popularizing Putonghua is not only easier to achieve in areas with concentrated populations and convenient transportation, but can also be quickly achieved in areas with vast land and sparse populations, inconvenient transportation, complex languages, and scattered villages.

The people who participated in the on-site meeting were very enthusiastic and unanimously expressed that they would be promoters of popularizing Putonghua and quickly launch a movement to popularize Putonghua throughout the province, striving to achieve voice standardization on the basis of popularization as soon as possible.

　　做推广普通话的促进派
    福建六个县基本普及了普通话
    据新华社福州5日电　在方言复杂的福建省，许多地区已掀起全民学习普通话的高潮。到8月底，全省已有大田、顺昌、云霄、莆田、建阳、龙溪等六个县基本上普及了普通话。在这些县里，会听会讲普通话的人数都达到青壮年和少年总数的85％以上，不少老年人也学会了一部分普通话。在福建省的一些交通不便的山区里，一个乡有好几种截然不同的话，给工作造成许多困难。随着工农业生产的大跃进，群众学习普通话的要求更加迫切了。各地党委在推广普通话工作中，都是书记挂帅，密切结合生产，紧密依靠群众，通过培养典型树立旗帜，并结合扫盲掀起民教民的群众运动。龙溪等县除组织宣传大军下乡宣传外，各乡还设立普通话教学站，干部、工人、店员当教员，学生在十字路口教人讲、于是短期内就形成人人学习普通话，处处讲普通话的新风气。
    在普及了普通话的地区，人们容易沟通思想，交流感情。党的方针政策、新的农业技术都能够迅速地在群众中贯彻下去，鼓舞了群众的革命干劲和生产热情。
    8月26日至30日，福建省教育厅在大田县召开了全省推广普通话现场会议，总结了福建省推广普通话的经验。来自全省各县的七十多位代表，通过现场参观，下乡访问，互相交流了经验，打破了推广普通话的神秘观点，增强了信心。从这次会议总结的经验来看，推广普通话不仅在人口集中、交通方便的地区较易做到，就是在地广人稀、交通不便、语言复杂、村落分散的地区，同样可以迅速做到。
    参加现场会议的人，劲头很大，一致表示要当个推广普通话的促进派，迅速地在全省范围内掀起一个推广普通话运动，在普及的基础上，争取早日实现语音标准化。
