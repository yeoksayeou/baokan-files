    Overcoming Difficulties to Obtain Steel
    Since the Party Central Committee issued the call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel in 1958, all teachers and students of Weifang Second Middle School in Shandong Province immediately shifted the focus of their work-study program to steel production, setting off a heat wave of fighting for steel.
    At 6:00 AM on September 10th, all teachers and students, following the completion of the first steaming stove the day before, threw themselves into the construction battle of the second batch of four steaming stoves, which were all completed by midnight on the 11th.
    In the process of building the stoves, all teachers and students struggled against various difficulties. For example, when transportation tools were lacking, the teachers formed a bicycle team, and the students used waste wood to make small wooden wheel carts. When bricks could not be bought, everyone dismantled all the useless walls on the school grounds. At present, all teachers and students have thrown themselves into the intense battle of iron smelting and have proposed to deliver ten tons of iron per furnace. (Xu Hui)

    战胜困难取钢铁
    自从党中央提出要在1958年生产一千零七十万吨钢的号召后，山东省潍坊市第二中学全体师生，立即把勤工俭学的重点，转为钢铁生产，掀起了为钢铁而战的热潮。
    9月10日晨六时，全校师生继头天建成的第一只甑炉之后，又投入到第二批四只甑炉的建炉战斗，到次日午夜十二时就全部竣工。
    在建炉过程中，全体师生对各种困难进行了斗争，如运输工具缺乏，老师就组成自行车子队，学生就利用废木料制成木轮小车。砖买不到，大家就拆掉校内所有没用的围墙。目前，全校师生已经投入到紧张的炼铁战斗中，并提出每炉交出十吨铁来。  （徐辉）
