　　Don't Allow the Aggressors to Tear Up the UN General Assembly Resolution
　　Cairo Radio Condemns US-UK Attempts to Occupy Lebanon and Jordan Long-Term
Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 2nd. Cairo's Voice of the Arabs radio station issued a commentary on September 1st condemning the US-UK imperialists and their lackeys for playing naked tricks to obstruct the implementation of the United Nations General Assembly resolution on the earliest possible withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The commentary said that they are adopting a policy that is completely contrary to the Arab countries' proposal, which they themselves agreed to and was unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.

The commentary then pointed out the following facts that show the US-UK attempt to continue occupying Lebanon and Jordan: The United States issued a statement saying that it has not yet decided to withdraw its troops from Lebanon; US troops are still building fortifications in Beirut; the outgoing Lebanese President Chamoun insists on a shameful position and has organized a new party demanding that the US occupation forces continue to stay in Lebanon; and the Jordanian Rifai government, controlled by Britain, insists that British troops remain in Jordan.

The commentary said that the shameful US-UK policy of refusing to withdraw their occupation forces from Lebanon and Jordan has no other justification than the "logic" of aggression. It is detrimental to peace. The commentary warned that in the past, imperialist countries brazenly occupied the territories of other countries in order to satisfy the desires of their small number of rulers, but in the end, the imperialists had to roll out under the curses and whippings of the people.

The commentary said that world opinion and the Arab people are watching what the imperialists and their lackeys will do in the face of the UN General Assembly resolution.

In a commentary broadcast on August 31st, Voice of the Arabs also exposed that US-British imperialism and its lackeys are creating various obstacles to obstruct the implementation of the United Nations General Assembly resolution, and demanded that United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld take a firm attitude to implement the United Nations General Assembly resolution.

The commentary revealed that Britain has concluded an arms deal worth between 30 million and 50 million pounds with Israel. The United States is also currently in talks with Israel. The British "New Statesman" weekly revealed that Britain is encouraging Israel to occupy the West Bank of the Jordan River, or at least threaten to attack the East Bank, in an attempt to create chaos in the Middle East, undermine the United Nations General Assembly resolution, and allow foreign troops to continue to occupy Lebanon and Jordan.

　　不许侵略者撕毁联大决议
　　开罗电台谴责美英企图长期占领黎约
    新华社开罗2日电　开罗阿拉伯之声电台1日发表评论，谴责美英帝国主义者及其走狗们玩弄赤裸裸的花招来阻挠执行联合国大会关于使美英军队尽早撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的决议。评论说，他们正在采取同他们自己同意的并为联合国大会一致通过的阿拉伯国家提案完全背道而驰的方针。
    评论接着指出，表明美英企图继续侵占黎巴嫩和约旦的下列事实：美国发表声明说它目前还没有决定从黎巴嫩撤军；美国军队还在贝鲁特建筑工事；即将下台的黎巴嫩总统夏蒙坚持可耻的立场，并且组织了一个要求美国占领军继续留驻黎巴嫩的新党；由英国控制的约旦里法伊政府则坚持英国军队留在约旦。
    评论说，美英拒绝使它们的占领军从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出的不光彩的政策，除了侵略的“道理”以外再没有任何其它道理。它是不利于和平的。评论警告说，过去，帝国主义国家为了满足它们的一小撮统治者的欲望而悍然占领别国领土，但是最后帝国主义者还是不得不在人民的咒骂声中和鞭打下滚出去。
    评论说，世界舆论和阿拉伯人民都在注视帝国主义者及其走狗们面对联合国大会的决议将干出些什么。
    阿拉伯之声电台在8月31日广播的评论中，还揭露美英帝国主义及其走狗们正在制造种种障碍来阻挠执行联合国大会的决议，并且要求联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德为执行联合国大会决议采取坚决的态度。
    评论揭露，英国已经同以色列做成了一笔价值三千万镑到五千万镑的军火交易。美国目前也正在同以色列商谈。英国“新政治家”周刊揭露说，英国正在怂恿以色列侵占约旦河西岸，或者至少以进攻东岸相威胁，企图借此在中东制造混乱局势，破坏联合国大会的决议，使外国军队继续侵占黎巴嫩和约旦。
