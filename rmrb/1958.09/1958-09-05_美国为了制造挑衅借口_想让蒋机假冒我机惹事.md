　　US Plots Provocation by Having Chiang Planes Impersonate Ours to Cause Trouble

　　Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from Yangon, 3rd: Western journalists here have learned from well-informed sources who have just come from Taiwan that the American warlords are preparing to use Chiang Kai-shek to conduct new military provocations against the People's Republic of China in the near future.

　　The well-informed source said that the commander of the "U.S.-Taiwan Defense Command," Navy Lieutenant General Roland Smoot, discussed and agreed with Chiang Kai-shek on a plan. According to this plan, during the joint US-Chiang Kai-shek naval and air force exercises scheduled for early September this year, Chiang Kai-shek aircraft with People's Republic of China markings will attack US warships. The planners of the provocation believe that this can be used as an excuse for the United States to take direct military action against People's China, and as a basis for the US government to raise the issue of so-called "forced action to defend Taiwan and the coastal islands" in the US Congress.

　　美国为了制造挑衅借口
    想让蒋机假冒我机惹事
    新华社4日讯  塔斯社仰光3日讯：这里的西方记者从刚刚到过台湾的消息灵通人士处获悉，美国军阀准备在最近利用蒋介石来对中华人民共和国进行新的军事挑衅。
    这位消息灵通的人士说，“美国台湾防御司令部”司令海军中将罗兰德·斯摩特同蒋介石研究并商定了一项计划，根据这个计划，在预定今年9月初举行的美国和蒋介石海空军联合演习的过程中，有中华人民共和国标志的蒋介石飞机将向美国军舰袭击。挑衅的策划者认为，这就可以用来作为美国对人民中国直接进行军事行动的借口，并且作为美国政府在美国国会提出所谓“被迫采取保卫台湾和沿海岛屿的行动”的问题的根据。
