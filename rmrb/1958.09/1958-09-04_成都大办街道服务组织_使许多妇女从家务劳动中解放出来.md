Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, September 1st. More than 380 street service organizations of various types, such as cooking service groups, childcare groups, laundry and mending groups, and household mutual aid stations, have recently been established in the streets and alleys of Chengdu. More than 3,200 housewives have participated in the service work, sharing household labor for many people in production and work positions.

    The establishment of various types of service organizations has enabled many housewives to free themselves from housework and participate in production and work. The Jiaozijie Street Office initially believed that the entire district lacked manpower and had difficulty in running industries and transferring labor, but after establishing some service organizations, it immediately discovered that more than 900 women could participate in production. At the same time, the establishment of various service organizations has also reduced the concerns of women who have already participated in production and work, allowing them to concentrate on production and improve work efficiency. Liao Mengchun, who participates in production at the Chengdu Battery Factory, used to have to go home to cook and eat every day, which wasted time and prevented her from focusing on production. She could only assemble 30 to 40 dozen batteries a day. Now that she has joined the cooking service group, she has improved to 200 dozen batteries a day. Li Huaqun, a student worker at the Xicheng District Woodware Production Cooperative, sent her child to the childcare group and also boarded at the street cafeteria. She has more time to consider production issues and quickly improved her skills. In the past month, she has successively proposed four rationalization proposals, which have played a positive role in production.

    Many members of service organizations have demonstrated their enthusiasm and earnestly serve the masses. The Wangping Hengjie Canteen even sends people to deliver meals to people's doors to facilitate the masses. After the Xiashaba Kindergarten opened its infant care service, when some mothers worked night shifts in factories, the childcare workers even delivered milk to the mothers' children at home in the middle of the night. The catering staff of the Luomashi Street Canteen tried to steam different types of rice, soft and hard, in one steamer to meet the different needs of the masses. Their conscientious service to the masses has been widely praised by the masses. The masses composed a quick-rhythm verse to praise these service organizations: "Meals and children are taken care of, so you no longer have to worry about two things at once; you can study technology and learn, ensuring great development in production. It is cheap to entrust children, and the canteen food costs less. Household labor is greatly reduced, and the mood is happy, and work efficiency increases."

    成都大办街道服务组织
    使许多妇女从家务劳动中解放出来
  新华社成都1日电　成都市的大街小巷最近先后成立了三百八十多个炊事服务组、托儿组、洗衣缝补组、家务互助站等各种类型的服务组织，有三千二百多家庭妇女参加了服务工作，替许许多多在生产和工作岗位上的人分担了家务劳动。
    各类服务组织成立起来，使许多家庭妇女能够从家务劳动中解放出来参加生产和工作。椒子街街道办事处辖区最初认为全区人力缺乏，在办工业和外调劳动力上都较困难，但在建立了一些服务组织以后，立刻发现有九百多名妇女可以参加生产。同时，各种服务组织的成立，也使已经参加了生产和工作的妇女减少了牵挂，使她们能安心生产，提高了工作效率。在成都电池厂参加生产的廖孟春，过去每天要回家作饭、吃饭，既耽误时间，又不能专心生产，每天只能装三、四十打电池，现在她在炊事服务组搭了伙，每天已提高到能装电池二百打。西城区木器生产社的学工李华群，把小孩送进托儿组，自己又在街道食堂里搭了伙，有了更多的时间来考虑生产上的问题，很快提高了技术，在最近一个月中，她接连提出了四件合理化建议，对生产起了积极作用。
    许多服务组织的成员发挥了积极性，认真地为群众服务。望平横街食堂为了方便群众，还抽出人来送饭上门。下沙坝幼儿园开办托婴业务以后，当一些母亲在工厂值夜班时，保育人员在半夜里还给母亲们留在家内的孩子送奶。骡马市街道食堂炊事人员为了满足群众不同需要，设法在一个甑子内蒸出软、硬不同的饭。他们这种认真为群众服务的作风受到群众的普遍赞扬。群众编了一首快板称赞这些服务组织：“吃饭、娃娃有照管，一心不再挂两边；能钻技术能学习，保证生产大发展。寄托娃娃收费廉，食堂伙食少用钱。家务劳动大减轻，心情舒畅工效增”。
