Hebei Daily News: The workers of the farm implement trial factory affiliated with the Cangxian Commercial Bureau of Hebei have successfully trial-produced a horse-drawn, fast potato harvester that is easy to use, low in cost, and highly efficient. This potato harvester is pulled by two draft animals and can harvest more than 30 mu of sweet potatoes per day.

This potato harvester was researched and created by carpenter Miao Zhengwen and ironworker Yan Zhenhu, among others, and has three major advantages: First, any general iron or woodworker can manufacture it at a glance; each unit only requires six workdays and costs only about 25 yuan. Second, the two guide wheels in the front and the two rudder wheels in the back of the potato harvester are equipped with ball bearings, making it very easy to use. With two ordinary animals pulling it, it can harvest more than 30 mu of potatoes per day, increasing efficiency twenty times compared to manual digging with hoes. At the same time, the operation is simple, only requiring one worker to master the depth adjustment, and only a few semi-able-bodied or auxiliary laborers are needed to pick up the potatoes from behind. Third, it can dig one and a half chi deep, and in the middle of the two potato-digging and soil-separating shares, there is also a specially installed triangular small iron shovel to specifically search for any missed potato pieces.

    马拉刨薯机刨薯又翻地
    河北日报消息  河北沧县商业局附属农具试制厂的职工，试制成一架使用方便、成本低、效率高的马拉快速刨薯机。这种刨薯机用两个畜力牵引，每天可刨三十多亩甘薯。
    这架刨薯机是由木工苗征文和铁工阎振虎等研究创造的，有三大优点：一、一般铁木工一看就可制造；每架只用六个工，只需二十五元左右。二、刨薯机前面两个导轮和后面两个舵轮都装有滚珠轴承，使用起来非常轻便。用两个一般的牲口牵引，每天可刨薯三十亩以上，比人力用镐刨提高效率二十倍。同时操作简单，只要一个劳力掌握深浅调节器，后边只用几个半劳力或辅助劳力拾即可。三、可以深挖一尺五，同时在两个刨薯分土的搜铧中间，还特别装设有三角形小铁铲，专门寻找漏掉的薯块。
