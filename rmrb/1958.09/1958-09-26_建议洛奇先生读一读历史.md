I suggest Mr. Lodge read some history
Cui Qi

In his speech at the UN General Assembly on September 22nd, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko condemned the US aggressive act of seizing China's territory of Taiwan, pointing out it was an imperialist policy. This caused the US representative to the UN, Lodge, to fly into a rage on the spot. He immediately took to the podium to "retort." Lodge said: "Mr. Chairman, we have never implemented any imperialist policies towards China. I suggest Mr. Gromyko read some history, read the records of John Hay and the 'Open Door' policy of fifty years ago. Then he will see how our policy has always been: to keep China free from foreign control."

Lodge actually appeared on the UN stage as a historian. He avoided talking about the US aggression against China today, and insisted on taking his audience back to the era of half a century ago. Why is that? There is only one explanation: Lodge thinks it is easier to deceive people with past events than with present events. However, unfortunately, Lodge's historical knowledge is so poor that it is practically zero. Therefore, we suggest that Lodge should read some history.

Below are some historical records about the US policy towards China, Mr. Lodge, please read them!

In 1839, the Qing Dynasty government of China banned opium in Guangzhou, and found that a large part of it was shipped by American opium dealers. It turned out that the American imperialists, like the British imperialists, began their "friendship" with the Chinese people by shipping opium to China.

In 1844, the United States forced the Qing Dynasty government to sign the "Treaty of Wangxia", and was the first to obtain "extraterritoriality" in China.

From 1857 to 1860, the Anglo-French allied forces invaded China, and American warships also participated in the action, and took the opportunity to force the Qing Dynasty government to sign the "Sino-American Tianjin Treaty", obtaining privileges such as restricting Chinese tariffs.

From 1873 to 1874, the United States assisted Japan in a joint attack on Taiwan.

In 1900, the United States participated in the Eight-Nation Alliance's invasion of China. At that time, the American consul in Beijing, Conger, and the American army played the worst role in instigating this war of aggression.

In 1917, US Secretary of State Lansing and Japanese Foreign Minister Ishii signed an agreement recognizing Japan's special rights in China.

In 1919, the United States recognized Japan's inheritance of privileges in Shandong Province at the Paris Peace Conference.

In 1925, in the "May 30th" massacre, American imperialists participated in the slaughter of the Chinese people.

In 1927, in order to suppress the Chinese Great Revolution, the United States joined Britain in shelling Nanjing, causing the "Xiaguan Massacre."

From 1931 to 1933, the United States provided loans, airplanes, and military advisers to assist Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government in attacking the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.

During the Japanese invasion of China, the United States supplied Japan with a large amount of military materials.

After Japan surrendered, the United States used billions of dollars to assist the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique in launching a large-scale anti-people civil war, attempting to replace Japanese imperialism and turn China into an American colony.

On June 25, 1950, eight months after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the United States launched the Korean War, pointing the spear directly at China. On June 27 of the same year, the US government announced that it would send armed forces to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and Penghu... until today.

May I ask the historian Mr. Lodge, can these facts prove that the United States "has never implemented any imperialist policies towards China"? Can these facts also prove that the US policy "has always been to keep China free from foreign control"?

Indeed, sometimes the United States is unwilling for China to be "controlled by foreign countries," but that is only to facilitate another "foreign country" (that is, the United States itself) to control China, and even dominate China. The so-called "Open Door" policy mentioned by Lodge is one example.

What is the "Open Door" policy? Lodge suggests reading the records of John Hay. Okay, let's do that. John Hay was the US Secretary of State at the end of the 19th century. At that time, the United States was busy with the war against Spain and consolidating its rule over the newly seized Philippine colony, and did not have time to participate in the competition among other colonial countries for dividing spheres of influence in China. Therefore, this American Secretary of State announced the so-called China "Open Door" policy in 1899. According to his own words, the purpose of this policy was nothing else but "to seek the expansion of my (American) commercial interests." Listen, "to seek the expansion of my commercial interests"! Isn't that clear enough?

Of course, there is still a question that can be raised, since it is "to seek the expansion of my commercial interests," why go around calling it "Open Door"? The American political commentator George Marion answered this question in his book "Bases and Empire." He wrote: "The most important thing about 'Open Door' is that the United States demands to share a part of the rights in this already divided territory of China. Because we have no excuse, we borrowed this moralized term."

Marion's passage not only explains the truth of the "Open Door" policy, but also illustrates the cunning and ugly face of the American aggressors. For decades, in order to carry out aggression and expansion against China, the "moralized" "excuses" invented by US imperialism have emerged one after another: what "Open Door", "equal opportunities", "strengthening Sino-American friendship", "encouraging the development of democratic politics in China", "combining the religious, charitable and cultural ties of the two nations of China and the United States", "respecting China's administrative and territorial integrity", "opposing foreign control of China", "joint defense"... Recently, a new excuse has been invented, called "ceasefire". As long as people compare these nice-sounding terms with the actual activities of the United States, they can more clearly understand the aggressive nature of US imperialism.

However, it is not enough to just suggest that Lodge read some history. Today's China is no longer the China of half a century ago. At that time, imperialism could use a few foreign guns and cannons to force China's door to "open" to them. Now, the Chinese people have stood up and are getting stronger and stronger. Even if the imperialists move out their guns, cannons, fleets, and what atomic bombs... they cannot make the Chinese people give up an inch of territory. When wolves can eat people, they can eat them without excuses; when wolves cannot eat people, they cannot eat them even with excuses. Not only can they not eat them, but they will definitely be beaten until they are bruised and bleeding. This point should be repeatedly memorized and firmly remembered by imperialists like Lodge. Otherwise, as Gromyko pointed out, US imperialism has fallen into a "world of illusion," and they may fall into the abyss or grave at any time.

    建议洛奇先生读一读历史
    崔奇
    9月22日，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在联合国大会的发言中，谴责了美国强占中国领土台湾的侵略行为，指出这是一种帝国主义的政策。这句话使美国驻联合国代表洛奇当场暴跳起来，他立即登上讲台，进行“回击”。洛奇说：“主席先生，我们对中国从来没有实行过任何帝国主义政策。我建议葛罗米柯先生读一读历史，读一读关于约翰·海和五十年前的‘门户开放’政策的记载。这样他就会看到我们的政策怎样始终是：使中国不受外国支配。”
    洛奇居然以历史学家的身份在联合国的讲台上出现了。他避而不谈今天美国对中国的侵略，而一定要把他的听众们带到半个世纪以前的时代去。这是为什么呢？只有一种解释：洛奇认为用过去的事情骗人比用现在的事情骗人要容易一些。可是，不幸得很，洛奇的历史知识偏偏是那么糟糕，简直等于零。因此，我们倒是建议洛奇应该读一读历史。
    下边就是关于美国对华政策的一些历史记载，洛奇先生，请读吧！
    1839年，中国清朝政府在广州查禁鸦片，发现其中有很大一部分是美国鸦片贩子运来的。原来美帝国主义者和英帝国主义者一样，他们对中国人民的“友谊”都是以运鸦片到中国来而开始的。
    1844年，美国强迫清朝政府同它签订了“望厦条约”，最先在中国取得了“治外法权”。
    1857—1860年，英法联军侵略中国，美国军舰也参加行动，并乘机迫使清朝政府订立“中美天津条约”，取得限制中国关税等特权。
    1873—1874年，美国协助日本联合进攻台湾。
    1900年，美国参加八国联军进攻中国，当时美国驻北京领事康格和美国军队在挑起这个侵略战争中起了最坏的作用。
    1917年，美国国务卿蓝辛和日本外相石井订立协定，承认日本在华特权。
    1919年，美国在巴黎和会上承认日本继承在山东省的特权。
    1925年，在“五卅”惨案中，美帝国主义者参加屠杀中国人民。
    1927年，美国为了镇压中国大革命，与英国联合炮击南京，造成“下关惨案”。
    1931—1933年，美国以贷款、飞机和军事顾问援助蒋介石反动政府进攻中国工农红军。
    在日本侵华期间，美国以大量军事物资供给日本。
    日本投降后，美国以几十亿美元援助蒋介石反动派发动大规模反人民的内战，企图代替日本帝国主义，把中国变为美国的殖民地。
    1950年6月25日，即中华人民共和国成立后的八个月，美国发动侵朝战争，把矛头直指中国。同年6月27日，美国政府又宣布派遣武装力量侵占了中国领土台湾和澎湖……直到今天。
    试问历史学家洛奇先生，难道这些事实能够证明美国“对中国从来没有实行过任何帝国主义政策”吗？难道这些事实也能够证明美国的政策“始终是使中国不受外国支配”吗？
    的确，有的时候，美国是不愿意中国“受外国支配”的，可是，那不过是为了便于另一个“外国”（就是美国自己）支配中国，以至独霸中国。洛奇提到的所谓“门户开放”政策，就是一例。
    什么叫做“门户开放”政策？洛奇建议读一读约翰·海的记载。好，我们就这样做。约翰·海是十九世纪末美国的国务卿。当时美国由于忙于对西班牙的战争和巩固它对刚刚夺取的菲律宾殖民地的统治，没有来得及参加其他殖民国家在中国瓜分势力范围的竞争。于是，这位美国国务卿在1899年就宣布了所谓中国“门户开放”政策。据他自己说，这个政策的目的并不是为了别的，而是为了“求我（美国）商业上利益之扩张”。请听，“求我商业上利益之扩张”！难道这句话说得还不够明白吗？
    当然还可以提出一个疑问，既然是“求我商业上利益之扩张”，又为什么要拐弯抹角叫做“门户开放”呢？美国政论家乔治·马立昂在“基地与帝国”一书中回答了这个问题。他写道：“‘门户开放’最主要的是美国要求在这个已经分割的中国的领土上分享一份权利。因为我们无可借口，所以就借用了这个道义化的名词。”
    马立昂的这一段话不但说明了“门户开放”政策的真相，而且也说明了美国侵略者的狡猾的丑恶的面貌。几十年来，为了对中国进行侵略和扩张，美帝国主义所发明的“道义化”的“借口”真是层出不穷：什么“门户开放”、“利益均沾”、“加强中美友谊”、“鼓励中国民主政治之发展”、“结合中美两民族的宗教上、慈善事业上以及文化上的联系”、“尊重中国的行政和领土完整”、“反对外国控制中国”、“共同防御”……。最近又发明一种新的借口，叫做“停火”。人们只要把这些好听的名词同美国的实际活动对照起来，就可以更清楚地认识美帝国主义的侵略本质。
    但是，仅仅建议洛奇读一读历史是非常不够的。今天的中国毕竟不是半个世纪以前的中国了。那时候，帝国主义依靠几支洋枪洋炮，就可以叫中国的门户向他们“开放”。现在，中国人民已经站起来，而且越来越强大了，帝国主义即使把他们的枪炮和舰队，还有什么原子弹……统统搬出来，也无法让中国人民放弃一寸领土。当狼能够吃人的时候，没有借口，照样可以吃；当狼不能吃人的时候，有了借口，也吃不了。不但吃不了，而且一定要被打得头破血流。这一点，是洛奇之流的帝国主义者应该反复背诵，牢牢记取的。否则，正像葛罗米柯所指出的，美帝国主义已经陷于“幻想的世界中”，他们随时随地都可能掉进深渊或者是坟墓。
