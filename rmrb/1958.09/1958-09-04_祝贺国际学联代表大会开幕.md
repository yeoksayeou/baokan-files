　　Congratulations on the Opening of the International Student Union Congress

    The Fifth Congress of the International Student Union opens today in Beijing, the capital of our country. Under the main topic of "The Development of the International Student Movement and the Contribution of the International Student Union and Student Organizations to Defending Student Interests and Promoting International Student Cooperation," the congress will discuss issues related to safeguarding peace, opposing colonialism, and defending student interests. Student representatives and observers from various countries attending the conference have arrived in Beijing one after another. We warmly welcome the convening of the International Student Union Congress in Beijing, and warmly welcome the young friends from various countries who have come to our country to participate in this conference!

    This conference is the most widely attended conference since the establishment of the International Student Union. When the First World Student Congress was held in Prague in 1946, only student representatives from forty-three countries participated. Participating in this conference are approximately two hundred official representatives and observers from seventy countries. Among them are student representatives from socialist countries, student representatives from nationalist countries and colonies and dependencies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and student representatives from capitalist countries. Nearly half of those participating in this conference are observers who do not belong to the International Student Union member organizations. These facts are a clear manifestation of the growing influence of the international student movement, the greatly increased prestige of the International Student Union, and the continuous strengthening of solidarity among students from various countries.

    One of the characteristics of the current international student movement is the general upsurge of students in nationalist countries and colonies and dependencies in their struggle against imperialism and for the defense and attainment of national independence. In the two years since the Fourth World Student Congress was held in Prague in 1956, a new situation of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind" has emerged internationally. The tide of national independence movements has expanded from Asia to Africa and Latin America. They have received the sincere sympathy and strong support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Students in these regions, together with their people, have actively participated in the great struggle against imperialism and for the defense and attainment of national independence. Egyptian students bravely participated in the battle against the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt; Syrian students took up arms to prepare to resist the armed attacks of the United States and Turkey. Students in Jordan and pre-revolutionary Iraq, despite the bloody suppression by the reactionary rulers, waged a resolute struggle against the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine. After the Iraqi people overthrew the reactionary rule of the Faisal dynasty and established a republic, the actions of American and British imperialism in armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, threatening the newly born Republic of Iraq, made the struggle of Arab students against imperialism even more vigorous. Iraqi students actively participated in the People's Resistance Army, fighting to defend the republic and against the threat of aggression by American and British imperialism. Jordanian students also bravely held demonstrations, protesting the occupation of Jordan by British invading forces, regardless of the mad suppression by the Hussein dynasty supported by the bayonets of the British occupation forces. Their just struggle has won the deep sympathy and support of students all over the world. In addition, Algerian students have engaged in a desperate struggle for national independence against the French colonialists; Indonesian students have actively participated in the struggle to recover West Irian and oppose foreign intervention; and students in various Latin American countries have launched a new wave of opposition to American intervention during the visit of US Vice President Nixon to Latin America this year. The strength of students in Asian, African, and Latin American countries against imperialism is increasing in the struggle, and their unity is also expanding.

    The International Student Union unites the vast number of students from various countries and has consistently made unremitting efforts to strive for peace, national independence, democracy, and student rights. It has actively mobilized students from various countries to enthusiastically respond to the Stockholm Appeal for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the signing movement for the declaration on the conclusion of a peace treaty among the five major powers; and called for opposition to the United States' launching of the war of aggression against Korea and protested against the United States' carrying out of bacteriological warfare. In January of this year, the Executive Committee of the International Student Union called on students all over the world to take immediate action to strive for the immediate cessation of atomic weapons tests, the prohibition of the manufacture and use of atomic weapons, and the implementation of international disarmament. These activities of the International Student Union have made outstanding contributions to the cause of safeguarding world peace. Since its establishment, the International Student Union has regarded supporting the struggle of students in colonies and dependencies for national independence as one of its main tasks. The International Student Union has actively supported the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries against imperialism and for national independence after the Second World War. The International Student Union has also actively supported the Chinese people's struggle for national liberation. Recently, it has actively supported the struggle of the Arab people against the American and British imperialist aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and the threat to the newly born Republic of Iraq. The International Student Union's consistent stance of supporting the struggles of the people of various countries against imperialism and for national independence has won the increasing trust and support of more and more students in Asian, African, and Latin American countries.

    Our people have always actively supported the struggles of the people of various countries to safeguard peace and strive for national independence, and support the unity and cooperation of the people of the world; and also actively support the efforts of the International Student Union in this regard. Our students have always actively responded to the calls of the International Student Union and actively participated in various activities organized by the International Student Union. As the Fifth Congress of the International Student Union is held in Beijing, our students will further strengthen solidarity with students from various countries and work together to safeguard world peace and oppose colonialism.

　　祝贺国际学联代表大会开幕
    国际学生联合会第五届代表大会今天在我国首都北京开幕。大会在“国际学生运动的发展以及国际学联和学生组织对于保卫学生利益和促进国际学生合作的贡献”的主要议题下，将讨论有关维护和平、反对殖民主义和保卫学生利益等问题。参加大会的各国学生代表和观察员已先后到达北京。我们热烈欢迎国际学联代表大会在北京召开，热烈欢迎前来我国参加这次大会的各国年青的朋友们！
    这次大会是国际学联成立以来参加者最广泛的一次大会。当1946年第一届世界学生代表大会在布拉格召开的时候，只有四十三个国家的学生代表参加。而参加这次大会的，有来自七十个国家的约二百多位正式代表和观察员。其中有社会主义阵营各国的学生代表，有亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲民族主义国家和殖民地与附属国的学生代表，也有资本主义国家的学生代表。参加这次会议的，将近一半是不属于国际学联会员组织的观察员。这些事实是国际学生运动的影响日益扩大、国际学联的威望大大增高和各国学生间的团结不断加强的鲜明表现。
    当前国际学生运动的特征之一，是民族主义国家和殖民地与附属国的学生反对帝国主义、维护和争取民族独立斗争的普遍高涨。从1956年在布拉格举行第四届世界学生代表大会以来的两年间，国际间出现了“东风压倒西风”的新形势。民族独立运动的浪潮已由亚洲扩展到非洲和拉丁美洲。它们得到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的真诚的同情和有力的支援。这些地区的学生和人民一起，积极地参加了反对帝国主义、维护和争取民族独立的伟大斗争。埃及学生英勇地参加了反抗英、法、以色列侵略埃及的战斗；叙利亚学生拿起武器准备抵抗美国和土耳其的武装进攻。约旦和革命前的伊拉克的学生，不顾反动统治者的血腥镇压，为反对巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义进行了坚决的斗争。在伊拉克人民推翻了费萨尔王朝的反动统治、建立了共和国之后，美英帝国主义武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦、威胁新生的伊拉克共和国的行为，使阿拉伯各国学生反对帝国主义的斗争更加昂扬。伊拉克学生积极参加人民抵抗军，为保卫共和国、反对美英帝国主义侵略威胁而斗争。约旦学生也不顾英国占领军刺刀支持下的侯赛因王朝的疯狂镇压，英勇地举行示威，抗议英国侵略军占领约旦。他们的正义斗争，获得全世界学生的深切同情和支持。此外，阿尔及利亚学生为民族独立同法国殖民者进行了殊死的搏斗；印度尼西亚学生积极参加了为收复西伊里安和反对外国干涉的斗争；拉丁美洲各国学生在今年美国副总统尼克松访问拉丁美洲时，又掀起了反对美国干涉的高潮。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国学生反对帝国主义的力量在斗争中日益加强，他们的团结也日益扩大。
    国际学联团结着各国广大的学生，始终不渝地为争取和平、民族独立、民主和学生权利而进行不懈的努力。它曾积极动员各国学生热烈响应要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言和缔结五大国和平公约宣言的签名运动；号召反对美国发动侵朝战争和抗议美国进行细菌战。今年1月，国际学联执委会又号召全世界学生立即采取行动，争取立即停止原子武器试验、禁止制造和使用原子武器和实行国际裁军。国际学联的这些活动，在保卫世界和平的事业中作出了卓越的贡献。国际学联从成立的时候起，就把支援殖民地和附属国学生争取民族独立的斗争作为自己的一项主要任务。国际学联积极支持了第二次世界大战后亚非各国人民反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的斗争。国际学联也曾积极支持过中国人民争取民族解放的斗争。最近，它又积极支持了阿拉伯各国人民反对美英帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩和约旦、威胁新生的伊拉克共和国的斗争。国际学联一贯支持各国人民反对帝国主义、争取民族独立斗争的立场，获得亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国愈来愈多的学生的信任和支持。
    我国人民一向积极支持各国人民维护和平、争取民族独立的斗争，拥护世界人民的团结合作；也积极支持国际学联在这方面的努力。我国学生一向积极响应国际学联的号召，并积极参加国际学联所举办的各项活动。当国际学联第五届代表大会在北京召开之际，我国学生将进一步加强同各国学生的团结，共同为维护世界和平、反对殖民主义而奋斗。
