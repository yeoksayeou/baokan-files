Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The broad masses of women across the country, who have begun to liberate themselves from tedious housework and live a new, happy collective life, are especially intolerant of U.S. imperialism's military provocations and threats of war against our country. In recent days, women workers, women farmers, families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, street women, and women from all walks of life have demonstrated tremendous power in the nationwide anti-American demonstrations. They wholeheartedly support the statements made successively by Premier Zhou and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, and are using various practical actions to twist their strength into a thick rope, ready to strangle any enemy who dares to invade.

The strength of Chinese women is enough to make American warmongers tremble. Among the more than 300 million people demonstrating across the country, half are women, a number almost equal to the entire population of the United States.

In Shanghai, more than two million of the city's three million women have held rallies and parades. More than 300,000 female textile workers in the city have also put forward the slogan "Spin one more thread, pull out one more sinew of the American imperialists; weave one more bolt of cloth, peel off one more layer of skin from the American imperialists," using practical actions to strike back at the American aggressors. In recent days, they have created countless new achievements and new records. The Yishi Juan Group, an advanced production red banner of the No. 2 State Cotton Mill, after achieving a speed of over 400 revolutions for 21-count yarn spindles, has increased the speed of 32-count yarn spindles from 283 revolutions to 300 revolutions, increasing production efficiency from 70% to 90%. The female workers of Shenxin No. 9 Factory have increased the production of roving by 10% in the past two days, saying, "Spin the yarn long and long, determined to strangle the American wolf!" The broad masses of neighborhood women have also taken swift action, some searching everywhere for scrap iron and steel to support industrial "drought resistance," and some voluntarily requesting to organize themselves to make military shoes for the soldiers at the front.

In Henan Province, which has already realized the people's commune system, more than seven million rural women have been liberated from tedious housework and have begun to live a new, happy collective life because of the establishment of 270,000 public canteens and more than 360,000 nurseries and kindergartens. When they heard the news of the American aggressors' military provocations against our country, they were all filled with righteous indignation and determined to strive for a double harvest of grain and steel to defend the motherland and defend their new happy life with practical actions. More than 200 young and middle-aged women from the Qiliying People's Commune in Xinxiang County carried their baggage and trekked through mountains and rivers to camp on the Taihang Mountains, more than 50 li away, to mine ore and smelt steel.

The broad masses of women in Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Jilin, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and other provinces are also using various practical actions to strike back at the American aggressors. Female members of the Jiguang Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province, the hometown of the volunteer army's special-class hero Huang Jiguang, are strengthening the field management of late rice in order to strive to achieve a per-mu yield of two thousand catties in order to support the struggle to liberate Jinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan. 67,000 women in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, participated in the autumn harvest and autumn field management work. In recent days, they have harvested 30,000 hectares of corn and stored 418 cellars of feed. They also plan to accumulate 120 carts of fertilizer per person before National Day. More than 35,000 women in Weifang City, Shandong Province, have formed 24 women's combat battalions and 55 combat companies, fighting day and night to support steel production.

Chinese women have never hesitated to give everything to defend peace. Many women have already firmly stated that once the motherland needs it, they will send their sons or husbands to the front line. Shi Laoda Niang, a member of the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Panjiazhuang, Changqing County, Shandong Province, and the mother of Shi Yuanhou, a martyr and first-class meritorious volunteer soldier, made such a vow: if the American aggressors dare to launch a war, she will call on the martyr's younger brother, Yuan Tai, to go to the front line. Xiang Yuanju, the mother of Peng Huanxin, a second-class hero and special-class meritorious volunteer soldier, also wants her youngest son, Peng Huanran, who is a reserve soldier, to be ready to listen to the call of the motherland at any time. Many families of martyrs and soldiers have also written letters to their relatives in the army, instructing them to be prepared at all times to strike at the American aggressors who dare to invade.

At the same time, young women in various places have also actively participated in military training. Among the more than 3,000 militiamen in Huijing Township, Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, more than 1,000 are women. 55% of the female militiamen in Tingzi Township, Jurong County, who participated in target practice, were rated as excellent. The more than 60 female construction workers of the First Women's Construction Engineering Team of the First Engineering Company of Harbin City organized a combat medical team, building buildings during the day and conducting military training after work. More than 300 young women on Nanri Island in Putian County, Fujian Province, located on the coastal defense front line, have joined the militia and, together with the male militiamen, vigilantly guard the coastal defense of the motherland with the People's Liberation Army every day.

    三亿妇女紧握手中绞索
    随时准备勒死胆敢来犯的敌人
    据新华社讯  已开始从繁琐的家务中解放出来，过着崭新的集体幸福生活的全国广大妇女们，尤其不能容忍美帝国主义对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。这些天来，各地女工人、女农民、烈军属、街道妇女等各阶层妇女都在全民反美示威运动中显示了巨大的力量，她们竭诚拥护周总理和陈毅外长先后发表的声明，并且用各种实际行动把她们的力量拧成一股大绳，随时准备勒死胆敢来犯的敌人。
    中国妇女力量之大，足以使美国战争狂人发抖。在全国三亿多人大示威的行列中，就有一半是妇女，这个数字差不多等于美国全部人口的总和。
    上海三百多万妇女中有两百多万人举行了集会和游行，全市三十多万纺织女工还提出“多纺一根纱，多抽美帝一根筋，多织一匹布，多剥美帝一层皮”的口号，以实际行动回击美国侵略者。几天来她们已经创造了无数的新成绩、新纪录。国棉二厂先进生产红旗——裔式娟小组在取得二十一支纱车速稳定在四百转以上的成绩以后，又把三十二支纱的车速由二百八十三转增加到了三百转，使生产效率由原来的70％提高到90％。申新九厂的女工们在最近两天内把粗纱产量提高了10％，她们说：“纱线纺得长又长，决心绞死美国狼！”广大里弄妇女也迅速行动起来，有的到处寻找废钢铁支援工业“抗旱”，有的自动要求组织起来给前方将士做军鞋。
    在已经实现了人民公社化的河南省，七百多万农村妇女由于成立了二十七万个公共食堂和三十六万多个托儿所、幼儿园，已经从繁琐的家务中解放出来，开始过着崭新的集体幸福生活。当她们听到美国侵略者对我国进行军事挑衅的消息后，个个义愤填胸，决心争取粮食、钢铁双丰收，以实际行动保卫祖国，保卫新的幸福生活。新乡县七里营人民公社二百多名青壮年妇女，背着行囊跋山涉水到相距五十多里的太行山上扎营，采矿石，炼钢铁。
    四川、黑龙江、山东、吉林、江苏、广东等省的广大妇女也都在用各种实际行动回击美国侵略者。志愿军特级英雄黄继光烈士的家乡——四川省中江县继光农业社的女社员们为了支援解放金门、马祖和解放台湾的斗争，正在加强晚稻田间管理，争取实现亩产双千斤。黑龙江省肇源县六万七千名妇女参加了秋收和秋田管理工作，最近几天她们已经收获三万垧苞米，储备了四百一十八窖饲料，他们还计划在国庆节以前每人积肥一百二十车。山东省潍坊市三万五千多名妇女，组成了二十四个妇女战斗营，五十五个战斗连，日夜为支援钢铁生产而战。
    中国妇女为了保卫和平，是从来也不吝惜自己的一切的，现在已经有许多妇女坚强地表示：一旦祖国需要，就把自己的儿子或丈夫送到前线去。志愿军一等功臣史元厚烈士的母亲、山东省长清县潘家庄光明农业社社员史老大娘就发出了这样的誓言：美国侵略者胆敢发动战争，就叫烈士的弟弟元泰到前线去。志愿军二级英雄、特等功臣彭焕新的母亲向远菊，也要她的服预备役的小儿子彭焕然时刻听候祖国的召唤。许多烈属、军属还纷纷写信给她们在部队里的亲人，嘱咐他们时刻准备着打击胆敢来犯的美国侵略者。
    同时，各地青年妇女还积极参加了军事训练。江苏省松江县汇径乡的三千多名民兵中，妇女就有一千多人。句容县亭子乡参加打靶的女民兵，有55％被评为成绩优秀。哈尔滨市第一工程公司第一妇女建筑工程队的六十多名女建筑工人，组织了一个战斗医疗队，白天盖大楼，下班以后就进行军事训练。处在海防前线的福建省莆田县南日岛上的三百多名青年妇女参加民兵后，每天都同男民兵们一起，配合人民解放军警惕地守卫着祖国的海防。
