　　Turning the Coastal Defense Front into an Impregnable Fortress
　　Fujian People Vow to Support the Frontline and Strike the Enemy with All Their Might
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 7th. 150,000 people in Fuzhou held rallies in different districts at 3:00 PM today to support Premier Zhou's statement and oppose the military threats of American imperialism. Participating in today's rallies were officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Fuzhou, who are defending the coastal defense front, fully armed militia from the coastal outposts, cadres from provincial and municipal organizations, workers, farmers, students, members of democratic parties, Taiwanese compatriots living in Fuzhou, and the broad masses of street residents. They carried resolutions that they had written overnight to the meeting place to swear to the Party and the government that they would resolutely defend the coastal defense outpost positions and make all preparations. If American imperialism dares to launch a war against the Chinese people, they will give it a devastating blow. Lin Xiude, member of the Standing Committee of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said that in recent years, American imperialism has supported the Chiang Kai-shek clique in continuously carrying out harassment and sabotage in the coastal areas of our country, which has brought serious disasters to the people of Fujian, especially the coastal people. The people of Fujian, who are at the forefront of coastal defense, will never forget the bloody atrocities of American imperialism and Chiang bandits. In his speech, Lin Xiude called on the people of the province to act quickly, redouble their efforts to do the current work well, and wait for the call of the motherland at any time, support the front line, and give the enemy a greater blow.
    Representatives of workers, farmers, and democratic parties all spoke at the meeting. Wang Tianqiang, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, spoke on behalf of the Taiwan League's Fujian organizations and Taiwanese compatriots in Fujian, saying that no provocation or threat from American imperialism can stop the six hundred million people's iron will to liberate Taiwan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 8th. Yesterday, people in coastal areas of Fujian Province held rallies and parades to angrily protest the criminal acts of American imperialism in creating tension in the Taiwan Strait area and threatening the Chinese people with aggressive war.
    In Xiamen, which is separated from Jinmen Island by the sea, more than 60,000 people held demonstrations yesterday. Jiangtou Town in Xiamen City was shelled by the Chiang bandit troops on Jinmen Island on the morning of June 6th, killing and wounding thirty-five farmers and students. When they held a parade in the city yesterday, they were also subjected to two enemy air raid alerts. The harassing and destructive activities of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and the military provocations of American imperialism aroused the unparalleled anger of the people of Xiamen. During the parade, they shouted "We must liberate Jinmen and Mazu!" "We must liberate Taiwan!" "American aggressor troops get out of Taiwan!" People also held many rallies to denounce the atrocities of the Chiang bandit troops. Fishermen, sailors, and farmers from Wutong, Hecuo and other villages, who are often subjected to harassment by Chiang bandit troops' planes, warships, and artillery fire, all said at their respective accusation meetings that they would guarantee to provide manpower, grain, and ships, and contribute all their strength to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, eliminating the enemies on the coastal islands, and avenging the people who were harmed by the Chiang bandit troops.
    The people of Lianjiang County, who are at the forefront of coastal defense, immediately boiled over after hearing Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area. Many workers and farmers gathered in workshops and fields, shouting, "We must liberate Taiwan!" "American troops get out of the Taiwan area!" Yesterday afternoon, more than 12,000 people from all walks of life in Lianjiang County held parades and demonstrations to resolutely protest the military provocations of American imperialism.
    After Premier Zhou's statement was transmitted to Putian County, the people of the urban area and Hankou immediately held rallies and parades with the participation of 45,000 people. The county also organized a broadcast meeting in the countryside for 500,000 people to listen to. After listening to the broadcast, the militia of Nanri Island, who often fight with the enemy, put forward the fighting slogan of "producing during the day, standing guard at night, holding our position, and preparing to strike the enemy."
    In Zhangzhou City in southern Fujian, a demonstration parade of 50,000 people was held yesterday.
