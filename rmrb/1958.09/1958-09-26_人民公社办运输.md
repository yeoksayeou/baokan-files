People's Communes Run Transportation

Today, our newspaper publishes an article written by the Communist Party Committee of Guanting Township, Changge County, Henan Province. This article introduces their experience in organizing worker-peasant-soldier transportation combat platoons, engaging in both industry and agriculture while running transportation, fundamentally solving the transportation bottleneck. The experience is good, and the article is well-written. The development and resolution of contradictions, and the step-by-step improvement of work, are clearly presented. People who work in transportation will certainly learn directly from the experience; people who do not work in transportation can also recognize how the rise of the people's communes will have such a broad impact on our lives. We suggest that everyone read this article.

Along the railway lines, we can see trains coming and going every day. They pass through busy marshalling stations, and also through quiet passing loops, but they pass more often through small intermediate stations like Guanting. Marshalling stations are mostly located in cities, where the sources of goods are concentrated, and loading and unloading operations are busy, usually with hundreds or thousands of stevedores working day and night. Passing loops are for trains to pass each other, they do not carry goods, and therefore have no stevedores. Intermediate stations are mostly located in rural areas, and the freight volume is not large, generally only one or two stevedores. This was the former face of railway transportation. Since the Great Leap Forward, the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production nationwide has changed the face of railway transportation. The loading and unloading volume of marshalling stations has greatly increased, and the loading and unloading volume of intermediate stations has also increased to varying degrees. The loading and unloading volume of Guanting Station in June of this year increased thirty-three times compared with the average monthly loading and unloading volume last year, showing a strong momentum. This is a common phenomenon. The loading and unloading volume of intermediate stations between Zhengzhou and Luohe increased five times in September compared to January; the loading and unloading volume of intermediate stations between Xinyang and Luohe increased four times in September compared to January, all indicating that due to the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the blossoming of local industries, the increase in loading and unloading volume of intermediate stations is inevitable.

Regarding the problem of insufficient loading and unloading capacity at large stations and the backlog of materials, Changzhou City's experience of "ants moving Mount Tai" already exists. However, for intermediate stations located in rural areas, most have neither cadres to organize, nor housewives to mobilize, and the family members of railway workers are also very limited, making it difficult to apply the experience of Changzhou. What should be done? One method that Guanting Station used to employ was to request that the unloading location be changed to a neighboring station when the station was blocked. This method, as the article by the Communist Party Committee of Guanting Township said, was a stumbling block on the road to the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. Not unloading the goods that should be unloaded at this station, but unloading them at another station, wastes transportation capacity, increases transportation costs, and delays production. Isn't this a "stumbling block"? Moreover, everywhere is leaping forward, and everywhere is tense. What if other stations cannot accept this extra unloading task? Obviously, this is not a fundamental solution to the problem. Another method is the one later adopted by the Communist Party Committee of Guanting Township: establishing worker-peasant-soldier transportation combat platoons in the people's commune, cultivating experimental fields and running factories near the station while loading and unloading vehicles. This method, as the article by the Communist Party Committee of Guanting Township said, is a new socialist organizational form that guarantees the overall Great Leap Forward of industry and agriculture.

Guanting's method is better than the temporary rush method they once used. Temporary rushes are certainly necessary. If the station is blocked, how can you not organize forces to rush to clear it? But waiting for the station to be blocked before organizing forces to rush is always a passive approach, not as good as unloading as soon as the goods arrive, unloading as much as arrives, and not being blocked at all. This method is also better than the method they once considered adopting of organizing a part of the manpower to be stationed at the station to engage in loading and unloading. Organizing a part of the manpower to be stationed at the station to engage in loading and unloading can certainly enhance the station's loading and unloading capacity, but the loading and unloading volume of intermediate stations is, after all, sometimes high and sometimes low, with great fluctuations. Concentrating a lot of people at the station, sometimes there is nothing to do, which is obviously a waste in the current situation of labor shortage. The advantage of the people's commune using the method of establishing worker-peasant-soldier transportation combat platoons to solve the station loading and unloading problem is that it does not have the drawbacks of the above-mentioned methods, and it fundamentally solves the transportation bottleneck problem, and integrates workers, peasants, soldiers and transportation, cultivating a group of multi-skilled people who engage in both industry and agriculture and transportation, and can "use both hands at the same time."

Intermediate station transportation accounts for a large proportion of the entire railway transportation. According to statistics at the end of last year, 92% of the railway stations in the country are intermediate stations. With the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the development of local industries, the proportion of intermediate station loading and unloading volume in the entire railway loading and unloading volume is also increasing. According to statistics from the Beijing Railway Administration, the current loading and unloading volume of intermediate stations accounts for 55% to 60% of the entire administration's loading and unloading volume. In the southern provinces, such as within the Shanghai Railway Administration and the Guangzhou Railway Administration, the proportion of intermediate station loading and unloading volume is even greater. The loading and unloading problem of intermediate stations is related to the 500 million peasants. If the intermediate stations are blocked and the materials cannot be unloaded or loaded, it will directly affect the leap forward of agricultural production and local industries. The loading and unloading problem of intermediate stations is also related to the development of railway transportation nationwide. If the intermediate stations are blocked, occupying the tracks and holding up the vehicles, the national railways cannot be unimpeded, and the loading volume cannot be increased. Therefore, in order to alleviate the tense situation of railway transportation, it is necessary not only to focus on marshalling stations, but also to focus on intermediate stations. The experience of Guanting Township People's Commune in running transportation points out a direction for solving the loading and unloading problem of intermediate stations. We hope that the county, town, and township party organizations and people's communes in the locations of more than 2,000 intermediate stations across the country will refer to Guanting's experience, participate in the loading and unloading work of the intermediate stations, and use the power of the people's communes to establish a transportation army that is both industrial and agricultural, ensuring that no stations are blocked and that all railways are unimpeded.

The experience of Guanting Township People's Commune in running transportation also reminds us that the rise of the people's communes has changed many things. The people's communes have more people, abundant funds, and great strength, and can do many things that agricultural production cooperatives were unable to do in the past, such as developing agricultural production on a large scale, building water conservancy projects, etc., which has put great pressure on industrial and transportation departments, requiring industrial departments to supply more means of production, and requiring transportation departments to transport them in a timely manner. However, precisely because the people's communes have more people, abundant funds, and great strength, they not only put pressure on industrial and transportation departments, but can also help industrial and transportation departments. They can run factories and transport on their own on a larger scale. This was also impossible in the era of agricultural production cooperatives. If it was not very clear in the past what form to use at the grassroots level to implement the policy of the whole people running industry and the whole people running transportation because there was no such a strong grassroots organization as the people's commune, and therefore some things were not very easy to do, then the rise of the people's commune has solved this problem. Now, any department that deploys work must consider the new problems raised by the rise of the people's commune, and must be good at giving full play to the power of the people's commune.

    人民公社办运输
    今天，本报发表了中共河南省长葛县官亭乡委员会写的一篇文章。这篇文章介绍了他们组织工农兵交通运输战斗连，边务工农、边办运输，根本解决运输堵塞问题的经验。经验好，文章也写得好。矛盾的发展和解决，工作的步步提高，写得层次分明。办运输的人读了，固然直接学到了经验；不办运输的人读了，也能认识到人民公社的兴起，将在我们的生活中发生多么广泛的影响。建议大家都来读读这篇文章。
    在铁路沿线，我们每天都可以看到一列列的货车来往奔驰，它们经过繁忙的编组站，也经过静静的会让站，而经过得更多的，则是像官亭一样的小小的中间站。编组站大都位于城市，货源集中，装卸作业繁忙，通常有成百上千的装卸工人日夜工作。会让站是给列车错车的，不运货，因而也没有装卸工人。中间站大都位于农村，货运量也不多，一般只有一二个装卸工人。这就是铁路运输昔日的面貌。大跃进以来，全国范围内工农业生产突飞猛进的发展，改变了铁路运输的面貌。编组站的装卸量固然大大增加，中间站的装卸量也有不同程度的增长。官亭车站今年6月份的装卸量比去年每月平均装卸量增加了三十三倍，来势比较猛。这是普遍的现象。郑州至漯河间的中间站，9月份的装卸量比1月份增加五倍；信阳至漯河间的中间站，9月份的装卸量比1月份增加四倍，都表明了由于农业生产的大跃进，由于地方工业的遍地开花，中间站装卸量增长是势所必然的。
    关于解决大站装卸能力不足，物资积压的问题，已经有了常州市“蚂蚁搬泰山”的经验。可是，对于位在农村的中间站说来，大多数既无机关干部可以组织，也无家庭妇女可以发动，铁路职工的家属也很有限，常州的经验难以用得上。怎么办呢？一种办法是官亭车站过去曾经采用过的：本站堵塞了，要求把卸车地点变更到邻近的车站去。这种办法，正如中共官亭乡委员会的文章中所说的那样，是做了工农业大跃进前进道路上的绊脚石。该在本站卸的货不卸，卸到别的站去，浪费了运力，增加了运输费用，耽误了生产，这不是“绊脚石”是什么呢？而且到处都在跃进，到处都很紧张，如果别的站也接受不了这额外的卸车任务又怎么办呢？显然，这根本不是解决问题的办法。还有一种办法，就是中共官亭乡委员会后来采用的办法：在人民公社设立工农兵交通运输战斗连，一面在车站附近种试验田，办工厂，一面装车卸车。这种办法，正如中共官亭乡党委会的文章中所说的那样，是保证工农业全面大跃进的社会主义的新的组织形式。
    官亭的这种办法，比他们曾经采用过的临时突击的办法好。临时突击当然是必要的。车站堵塞了，不组织力量突击怎么行呢？但等车站堵塞了，再去组织力量突击，总是一种被动的做法，不如随到随卸，来多少卸多少，根本不堵塞来得好。这种办法，也比他们曾经考虑采用过的组织一部分人力专驻车站搞装卸的办法好。组织一部分人力专驻车站搞装卸，固然不难增强车站的装卸能力，但中间站的装卸量毕竟是忽高忽低，波动很大的。集中了很多人在车站，有时并无事可做，这在目前劳动力缺乏的情况下显然是一种浪费。人民公社用成立工农兵交通运输战斗连的办法来解决车站装卸问题的好处，就在于它没有上述各种办法的弊端，而且既从根本上解决了运输堵塞问题，又把工农兵运输溶于一体，培养出一批既务工农、又办运输，能“左右开弓”的多面手。
    中间站运输在整个铁路运输中占有很大的比重。据去年年底的统计，全国铁路车站中92％都是中间站。随着农业生产的大跃进和地方工业的发展，中间站装卸量在整个铁路装卸量中所占的比重也日益增加。据北京铁路管理局的统计，目前中间站装卸量占全局装卸量的55％至60％。在南方各省，如上海铁路管理局和广州铁路管理局境内，中间站装卸量的比重还要大。中间站的装卸问题，是关系到五亿农民的问题。中间站堵塞了，物资卸不下来，装不上去，直接影响到农业生产和地方工业的跃进。中间站的装卸问题，还关系到全国铁路运输的发展。中间站堵塞了，占了道，压了车，全国铁路不能畅通，装车量也不能增加。因此，为了缓和铁路运输的紧张状况，不仅要抓编组站，而且要抓中间站。官亭乡人民公社办运输的经验，为解决中间站的装卸问题指出了一个方向。我们希望全国二千多个中间站所在地的县、镇、乡党组织和人民公社都参照官亭的经验，参加中间站的装卸工作，用人民公社的力量成立一支亦工亦农的运输大军，保证站站不压车，条条铁路通行无阻。
    官亭乡人民公社办运输的经验，还提醒我们：人民公社的兴起，使许多事情发生了变化。人民公社人多、资金雄厚、力量大，可以兴办许多农业生产合作社时代无力办到的事情，如大规模地发展农业生产，兴修水利工程等等，这就给了工业、运输等部门很大的压力，要求工业部门供给更多的生产资料，要求运输部门及时运输。但是，正因为人民公社人多、资金雄厚、力量大，它不仅给工业、运输等部门以压力，而且也能给工业、运输等部门以帮助。它可以在更大的规模上自己来办工厂、自己来办运输。这也是农业生产合作社时代不可能有的事情。如果说过去因为没有人民公社这样强大的基层组织，用什么样的形式在基层贯彻全民办工业、全民办运输等方针还不十分明确，因而有些事情还不十分好办，那么，人民公社的兴起已经解决了这个问题。现在，任何部门部署工作，都要考虑人民公社的兴起所提出的新的问题，都要善于发挥人民公社的力量。
