Xinhua News Agency, 10th — The tide of anger against American aggressors has spread to minority areas across the country. Whether in border regions and deep mountains, or on grasslands and in rural villages, millions of people from minority ethnic groups have launched powerful protest demonstrations in recent days.

    In pastoral areas of Qinghai Province, protest slogans written in various ethnic languages are visible everywhere. In Chabcha, the largest town in the Hainan grassland, the torchlight parade on the 7th lasted all night, and the processions on the 8th and 9th continued uninterrupted. Danzeng De'er (Tibetan), the governor of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, stated: We will support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions of continuing to vigorously develop people's communes in pastoral areas.

    In remote areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, more than 100,000 people from minority ethnic groups have held meetings and parades. The people of all ethnic groups in the Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner have decided to immediately enhance the country's power with practical actions of vigorously developing local industries with steel as the key, vigorously developing people's communes, and accelerating tool reform.

    The demonstration movement of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is in full swing. In Guixian County, mass meetings have been held more than 1,500 times in the past two days, and more than 250,000 big-character posters supporting Premier Zhou's statement have been put up. In the past two days, 1.1 million people from seventeen counties and cities have participated in rallies and parades. Employees of some factories immediately launched activities to donate iron and steel. 160,000 Miao, Zhuang, and Dong people in the Greater Miao Mountains and more than 30,000 Yao people in the Greater Yao Mountains, carrying weapons used for training, held protest rallies and demonstrations, resolutely opposing US imperialist military provocations. At the meeting in the Greater Yao Mountains Yao Autonomous County, a militia division was established on the spot. In the Greater Miao Mountains Miao Autonomous County, more than 150,000 people aged sixteen to fifty each have a wooden gun, basically implementing universal conscription, and are stepping up military training in the gaps of production. They warned the American imperialists: If the American imperialists dare to launch a war of aggression, we must completely and thoroughly eliminate them!

    In the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Changbai Korean Autonomous County, Fusong County and other places in the Changbai Mountain area on the northeastern border of the motherland, people of all ethnic groups have gathered to hold rallies and parades in recent days. The masses in Changbai Korean Autonomous County said: We are the old base of the Anti-Japanese United Army. We are not easy to mess with. If the American aggressors do not withdraw their claws, we will, together with the people of the whole country, completely eliminate them.

    The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference and the Autonomous Region Islamic Association jointly held a meeting to strongly protest against US imperialist armed interference in our country's internal affairs. Islamic Ahongs from both sides of the Tianshan Mountains and tribal leaders from the Kazakh pastoral areas participated in the meeting, which passed a letter of protest.

    The more than 4 million minority people in Guizhou Province and the more than 1 million Hui and Han people in the Ningxia region have expressed their intolerance of US imperialist military provocations, and many places have held rallies and parades overnight.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 9th — More than 400 public leaders of minority ethnic groups in the border areas of Yunnan Province gathered in Kunming to support Premier Zhou's statement and denounce American military provocations.

    Minority state governors, deputy state governors, county magistrates of various border autonomous prefectures, and leaders of various ethnic groups such as Dai, Yi, Kawa, Jingpo, Hani, Lisu, Tibetan, Lahu, and Zhuang attended the meeting. In their speeches, everyone was filled with righteous indignation, and unanimously stated that the five million people of all ethnic groups in the border areas, who have a fine tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, will unite with the people of the whole country to produce more grain, produce more steel, heighten vigilance, and guard the southwest gate of the motherland. Hu Zhonghua, Kawa public leader and deputy commissioner of the Lincang Special District, said: The Kawa people, who have never succumbed to imperialism, have gained the wise leadership of the Communist Party, and today, in the Great Leap Forward, have changed their primitive way of life, further consolidating their confidence in defeating imperialism. We are determined to unite with all ethnic groups in the country as one person and fight imperialism to the end. Song Mou, Tibetan public leader and governor of the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, said: A Tibetan proverb says, "A grasshopper cannot jump more than five inches." American imperialism cannot scare our 600 million people either. Li Hecai, governor of the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, said: During the Liberation War, the United States provided a large number of weapons to the Chiang Kai-shek army to slaughter Chinese compatriots, but still failed to prevent the victory of the Chinese people. In today's international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the motherland, which is in the midst of a leaping advance, is like the rising sun, which no force can extinguish. No matter how mad American imperialism is, it cannot save their dying fate. Lei Chunguo, deputy governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, on behalf of all the Jingpo people, stated: We must set off an even larger production upsurge, prepare the material strength to meet imperialism and liberate Taiwan; strengthen militia training, carry forward the fine tradition of anti-imperialist struggle of minority ethnic groups, and be a hundred times more vigilant against imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits taking the opportunity to harass the border areas of the motherland.

    新华社10日讯　反对美国侵略者的怒潮已扩展到全国少数民族地区，不论边疆和深山地区，或是草原和农村，千百万少数民族人民连日展开了强大的抗议示威运动。
    在青海省牧业地区，到处看到用各民族文字写成的抗议标语。海南草原的最大集镇恰卜恰，7日的火炬游行通宵达旦，8、9两日的游行队伍还是川流不息，海南藏族自治州州长丹德尔（藏族）表示：要用继续在牧业区大办人民公社的实际行动来支援解放台湾的斗争。
    内蒙古自治区边远地带的十多万少数民族人民纷纷举行集会和游行，莫力达瓦达斡尔族自治旗的各族人民，决定立即用大办以钢为纲的地方工业、大办人民公社和加速工具改革的实际行动来增强国家的威力。
    广西僮族自治区各族人民的示威运动如火如荼，贵县两天来的群众集会已达一千五百多次，贴出拥护周总理声明的大字报达二十五万多张。两天来，十七个县、市参加集会游行的已有一百一十万人，有些工厂的职工立即展开了献钢铁的活动。大苗山十六万苗、僮、侗族人民和大瑶山三万多瑶族人民，背起平时操练用的武器，分别举行抗议集会和游行示威，坚决反对美帝的军事挑衅。在大瑶山瑶族自治县的集会上，当场成立了一个民兵师，大苗山苗族自治县十六岁到五十岁的十五万多人，每人都有一支木枪，基本实行了全民皆兵，并且在生产空隙加紧军事训练。他们警告美帝国主义说：如果美帝胆敢发动侵略战争，我们一定要干净、彻底地消灭它！
