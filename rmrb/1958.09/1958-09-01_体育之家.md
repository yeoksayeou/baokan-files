　　In mid-August, this reporter visited the "Sports Home" of the Twenty-first Production Team of the Linghe Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangjiyingzi Township, Beipiao County.

　　Having just finished lunch, this reporter arrived at the "Sports Home" and met all the members of this family at their own simple sports ground. The whole family had just finished their midday sports activities.

　　Li Zaipu and Li Zailin, after graduating from senior primary school in 1954, participated in agricultural production. These two "basketball fans" have never interrupted their physical exercise in labor production since leaving school. This year, they were selected as members of the township basketball team and became third-level athletes.

　　After the Liaoning Provincial Sports Commission and the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly held a rural sports work on-site meeting in Beipiao in mid-June, rural sports activities expanded from young people to the elderly, and the number of people participating in physical exercise in various townships and cooperatives increased even more.

　　One evening in early July, a family meeting was held at Li Wencheng's home. Li Zaipu proposed that the whole family learn broadcast calisthenics. Li Zailin's wife, Wang Shuqin, agreed first because she often played basketball. The sister-in-law, who was relatively weak, also expressed willingness to participate in exercise. The sixty-year-old mother happily said, "It's good for old people to do exercises, so they don't get sick easily from staying indoors all day." Although Li Wencheng, who was over sixty years old, felt that he was old and not very agile, he was excited to see the enthusiasm of the whole family and said, "It's good for me to exercise with you." From the next morning, the whole family participated in physical exercise. Li Zaipu served as the family's coach, Li Zailin guided his father, and the two daughters-in-law assisted their mother-in-law. More than twenty days later, they all learned the first set of broadcast calisthenics and the labor exercises formulated by the township. Li Zaipu and Li Zailin and their wives all passed the first-level standard of the Labor and Defense System.

　　In order to carry out diverse sports activities, the Li Zaipu brothers built a simple small sports ground in the open space in front of their house. The host led this reporter to visit the sports ground. Next to a square sandpit, there were high jump stands and a springboard for the long jump. Next to the stone dumbbells were two hand grenades with wooden handles attached to old iron pipes. Ropes for climbing poles and swings hung from the big trees. On the other side of the sports ground stood a small basketball hoop less than two meters high, which was where the two three- to five-year-old children often practiced shooting.

　　Li Wencheng, who used to have a sore back when lifting heavy objects, today lifted a thirty-jin stone dumbbell over his head in front of this reporter. The old woman who was in charge of the family's housework told this reporter that she used to feel dizzy after working for a long time and coughed at night. Now she feels much better and her cough has lessened. At this time, Wang Shuqin placed the sorghum stalk on the high jump stand at a height of more than one meter and easily crossed it. Then, Li Zaipu raised the bar to a height of one meter and forty centimeters, took a few steps, and jumped over it. Li Zailin told this reporter that his brother is the record holder for high jumping one meter and fifty centimeters in the whole township.

　　体育之家
    新华社记者　任步芳
    8月中旬，记者访问了北票县章吉营子乡凌河农业生产合作社第二十一生产队的“体育之家”。
    刚刚吃过午饭，记者来到“体育之家”的门前，在他们自己的简易运动场上会见了这家的全部成员。他们全家刚刚做完午休的体育活动。
    李在圃和李在林1954年高小毕业以后，就参加了农业生产，这一对“篮球迷”离开学校以后，在劳动生产中从没有间断过体育锻炼。今年，他们被选为乡篮球代表队的队员，成了三级运动员。
    今年6月中旬，辽宁省体育运动委员会和共青团辽宁省委员会，联合在北票召开农村体育工作现场会议以后，农村的体育活动由青年人扩展到老年人，各乡各社参加体育锻炼的人数更加增多了。
    7月初的一个晚上，李文成家召开了家庭会议，李在圃提出全家学习广播体操的建议，李在林的爱人王淑琴，因为经常玩篮球，首先表示同意。身体比较虚弱的嫂子也愿意参加锻炼。六十岁的老母亲高兴地说：“年老人做做操也好，省得天天呆在屋里容易生病。”六十多岁的李文成虽然感到自己年岁大了，身子不怎么灵便，但是看到全家人的这股干劲也兴奋地说：“我跟你们一起活动活动也好。”从第二天清晨起，全家都参加了体育锻炼。李在圃担任全家的教练，李在林作爸爸的指导，两个媳妇作婆婆的辅导员。二十多天以后，他们都学会了第一套广播体操和乡里制订的劳动操。李在圃、李在林两夫妇都通过了劳卫制一级标准。
    为了开展多样的体育活动，李在圃兄弟俩，在门前的空地上修建了一个简易的小型运动场。记者由主人引导参观了这个运动场。在一个方形的沙坑旁，有跳高架和跳远用的踏板。在石锁一旁放着两个用旧铁管安上木把的手榴弹。大树上挂着爬杆和荡秋千的绳子。在运动场的另一边，竖立着一个不到两公尺高的小篮球架，这是两个三、五岁的孩子经常练习投球的场所。
    过去一拿重东西腰就发疼的李文成，今天在记者面前，把三十斤重的石锁一举过顶。担任全家家务劳动的老大娘告诉记者：她过去干活时间一长就头晕，夜里还要咳嗽。现在身子觉得好多了，咳嗽也减轻了。这时，王淑琴把跳高架上的高粱秆摆在一公尺以上的高度，轻松地越过了。接着，李在圃又把横杆升到一公尺四十公分的高度，跑了几步也一跃而过。李在林告诉记者，他哥哥是全乡跳高一公尺五十公分纪录的保持者。
