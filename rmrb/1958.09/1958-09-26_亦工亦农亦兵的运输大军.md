    The Transportation Army That is Both Workers and Peasants and Soldiers
    The Communist Party of China, Guanting Township Committee, Changge County, Henan Province
    Our People's Commune in Guanting Township, Changge County, Henan Province, recently established a worker-peasant-soldier transportation combat company, which farms land and runs factories near Changge Station while loading and unloading cargo, ensuring simultaneous leaps forward in industry, agriculture, and transportation.
    
    Industrial and Agricultural Leap Forward, Station Congestion
    Since the beginning of this year, under the glorious illumination of the General Line, Guanting Township, like the rest of the country, has experienced rapid development in industrial and agricultural production. More than 200 factories have been built throughout the township, and the per-mu yield of agricultural products has increased more than threefold compared to the same period last year. The development of industrial and agricultural production has brought heavy tasks to the transportation industry. Guanting Station's average monthly loading and unloading volume last year was 20 cars; this June, it leapt to 670 cars, an increase of 33 times compared to last year, and it has the characteristics of rapid momentum, urgent timing, and concentrated arrivals. The station originally had only one loader and 28 porters recruited from agricultural cooperatives, which could not meet the needs at all. Under this situation, although the station tried some methods, due to the continuous arrival of goods in large quantities, both sides of two of the three tracks were filled with unloaded goods, stacked like small mountains. Guanting Station even diverted coal cars that should have been unloaded at this station to the neighboring Heshangqiao Station. This practice of Guanting Station not only failed to act as a "pioneer" but became a stumbling block on the road to the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, directly affecting the advancement of the "three marshals."
    
    Mobilize the Whole People for Transportation
    After seeing this situation and listening to the stationmaster's report, the Party Committee realized that it was necessary to have a great leap forward in the transportation industry to ensure the smooth flow of the main battlefield on the railway transportation front—the station—in order to adapt to the needs of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture.
    
    However, there was also a struggle between two methods and two lines in solving this problem. At that time, due to weather changes, Guanting Township, according to the instructions of the county party committee, mobilized all available forces in the township to devote themselves to the urgent task of harvesting crops. Just at this critical juncture when both agriculture and transportation were facing urgent tasks, the township party committee held a meeting to study the situation. The Party Committee Secretary put forward the measure of "harvesting while transporting," which was agreed and supported by the vast majority of comrades, but individual comrades had insufficient understanding of the importance of the transportation industry and had many ideological resistances. For example, they said, "What if drawing some people to engage in transportation makes it impossible to complete the harvest task?" "If Guanting Station can't unload, won't it be unloaded at other stations?" "Wouldn't it be enough to ask the shipping units to ship less goods?" "If two tracks are occupied, isn't it possible to still pass on another track?"
    
    In response to these negative thoughts, the Party Committee organized all comrades to conduct fierce debates, focusing on the importance of railway transportation, the relationship between railway transportation and industry and agriculture, who should rely on to run transportation, whether agriculture can leap forward if the railway doesn't leap forward, and whether we dare to and can organize an overall leap forward. Through the above debates and the factual education of the station blockage, everyone gradually unified their thinking, realizing that railway transportation is the main artery of the national economy and the pioneer of ensuring the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. If agriculture wants a bumper harvest and a greater leap forward, it must have the support of industry, and industrial products must be transported to the countryside through transportation. Railway transportation is a matter for the whole party and the whole people, not just for railway personnel. Everyone believed that if dozens or hundreds of people were drawn from the township's more than 10,000 people to engage in transportation, as long as the labor was arranged properly, the task was explained to the masses, and everyone's enthusiasm was brought into play, the tasks of harvesting and transportation could be completed simultaneously.
    
    After the Party Committee made a decision, in less than half a day, it organized a transportation army of more than 330 people. Everyone carried baskets, shoulder poles, wicker crates, and pushed small carts to the station in a mighty manner. After three days and nights of hard work, more than 3,000 tons of accumulated goods were moved away, eliminating the station blockage. At the same time, the task of harvesting crops was also completed ahead of schedule.
    
    From Two Members to Four Members
    After the station blockage was cleared, in order to solve the contradiction between the insufficient loading and unloading capacity and the increasing volume of transportation in the long term, we came up with three solutions: one is to organize a temporary task force to rush to work when the station is blocked, but this is a passive approach. People are temporarily drawn together, unfamiliar with the business, which can easily cause wasted work and low production efficiency. Another method is to organize a group of people to be stationed at the station to engage in loading, unloading, and transporting. This method seems to meet the requirements of transportation volume, but because the loading and unloading tasks are not frequent and fluctuate greatly, especially in the current situation of labor shortage, it wastes manpower.
    
    Finally, we adopted the method of integrating workers and peasants, combining industry and agriculture. According to the needs of transportation and loading and unloading work, 40 commune members were drawn to form a socialist worker-peasant cooperation leap forward team. The leap forward team planted 50 mu of experimental fields near the station, established a pig farm to engage in pig breeding and fertilizer accumulation. When there are loading and unloading tasks, they go to load and unload; when there are no loading and unloading tasks, they engage in agriculture. The team members are both production workers and transportation workers, which does not affect agricultural production and ensures transportation needs.
    
    Soon, Guanting Township established a People's Commune. The Party Central Committee put forward the great call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel by the end of the year. The commune invested in a high tide of steelmaking and ironmaking, and at the same time, undertook the tasks of repairing the railway double track and water conservancy, drawing about 3,000 people from the township's labor force. Under the situation of this greater leap forward, the original organizational form could no longer meet the needs. In order to ensure an overall leap forward, the Party Committee conducted further research and, starting from August 20, combined with the task of militia training, drew 120 young people aged 18 to 25 from the township's militia to form a worker, peasant, and soldier transportation combat company, with three platoons and nine squads, and appointed a company commander, instructor, platoon leader, squad leader, and other positions, and vacated part of the houses in the villages near the station for collective accommodation. All personnel are collectivized in life, militarized in organization, and combatized in action. They planted 700 mu of "Marshal Fields" (the original experimental fields) themselves and opened five enterprises such as steelmaking plants and machinery factories. All income belongs to the cooperative, and all personnel implement a scoring system. The original two members were transformed into four members, namely production worker, transportation worker, combatant, and security guard.
    
    Since the establishment and development of this organizational form, it has gradually shown its superiority. This year, the "Marshal Fields" of this company can harvest 100,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu, and it is estimated that each mu of corn will yield more than 7,000 jin. Currently, they are focusing on deep plowing to ensure that high-yield wheat "satellites" will be released next year. The blockage of Guanting Station has also been fundamentally resolved, and various transportation indicators have improved, achieving how much arrives, how much is unloaded; how much is unloaded, how much is moved; how much is available, how much is loaded, constantly maintaining smooth cargo positions, and meeting the transportation needs of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture.
    
    In practice, we have realized that the worker-peasant-soldier transportation combat company is a new socialist organizational form to ensure the overall great leap forward in industry and agriculture. This form is in line with the policy of the whole party and the whole people running transportation. Because the worker-peasant-soldier transportation combat company integrates workers, peasants, soldiers, and transportation, it not only grasps agriculture and industry but also ensures the pioneer role of transportation, not only truly presenting a situation of overall leap forward but also being beneficial to the cultivation of communist talents.

    亦工亦农亦兵的运输大军
    中共河南省长葛县官亭乡委员会
    我们河南省长葛县官亭乡的人民公社，最近成立了一个工农兵交通运输战斗连，在长葛车站附近一面种田，办工厂，一面装车卸货，保证了工农业和交通运输业一齐跃进。
    工农业跃进，车站堵塞
    今年以来，在总路线的光辉照耀下，官亭乡和全国各地一样，工农业生产有着飞跃的发展，全乡兴建了二百多个工厂，农产品每亩产量比去年同期增加三倍多。工农业生产的发展给交通运输业带来了繁重的任务。官亭车站去年每月平均装卸二十车，今年6月份跃增到六百七十车，比去年增加三十三倍，而且具有来势猛、时间急、到达得集中的特点。车站原来只有一名装卸工人和二十八名由农业社找来的搬运工人，根本不能满足需要。在这种形势下，车站虽然想了一些办法，但由于货物连续大批到达，三条股道中有两条股道的两边都卸满了货，一层压一层，堆的像小山一样。官亭车站还曾经将本来应该在本站卸的煤车，变更到邻近的和尚桥车站去卸车。官亭站的这种做法，不仅没有当好“先行官”，反而成为工农业大跃进道路上的绊脚石，直接影响了三大元帅的升帐。
    全民动员搞运输
    党委会看到这种情况，并听了车站站长的汇报后，认识到必须使运输业来个大跃进，保证铁路运输战线上的主要战场——车站畅通无阻，才能适应工农业大跃进的需要。
    但是在解决这个问题上，也存在着两种方法两条路线的思想斗争。当时由于天气变化，官亭乡根据县委指示动员全乡可以动员的力量，投入紧张的农作物抢收任务。就在这个农业、交通运输业双方任务紧急的关头，乡党委召开会议，进行研究。党委书记提出了边抢边搬的措施，得到绝大多数同志的同意和拥护，但有个别同志对交通运输业的重要性认识不足，思想上有许多抵触。如说：“抽一部分人搞运输完不成抢收任务怎么办？”“官亭站卸不下不会卸到别站去？”“叫发货单位少发点货不就行了吗？”“占用两股道另外一股道不是还可以通车吗？”
    党委针对这些消极的思想，组织全体同志进行了激烈的争辩，着重辩论铁路运输的重要性，铁路运输与工农业之间的关系，交通运输应该依靠谁来办，铁路不跃进农业能否跃进上去？我们敢不敢、能不能组织全面跃进？通过以上的辩论和车站堵塞的事实教育，大家逐渐统一了思想，认识到铁路运输是全国经济的大动脉，是保证工农业大跃进的先行官，农业要想大丰收和更大的跃进，必须有工业的支援，而工业产品又必须通过交通运输才能运到农村，铁路运输是全党全民的事，不单是铁路部门人员的事。大家认为，如果从全乡一万多人中抽出几十个或几百个人来搞运输，只要劳力安排得当，将任务向群众讲清，发挥每个人的积极性，抢收和运输的任务是可以同时完成的。
    党委作出决定后，不到半天就组织了三百三十多人的搬运大军，大家提着篮子，挑着担子，抬着荆筐，推着小车浩浩荡荡奔赴车站，苦战了三昼夜，堆积的三千多吨货物搬得干干净净，消除了车站堵塞现象。在此同时，农作物抢收任务也提前完成了。
    两员变四员
    车站堵塞现象解除后，为了长期解决装卸能力不足同运量日益增长的矛盾，我们曾想出了三种解决办法：一种是在车站堵塞时临组时织突击，但这是被动的作法，临时抽人凑在一块，人生业务不熟，也容易造成窝工浪费，生产效率不高。另一种是组织一部分人力专驻车站搞装卸搬运，这种办法看来似乎是满足了运量的要求，但因装卸车任务不经常，波动性很大，特别在目前人力缺乏情况下，更浪费人力。
    最后我们采取了亦工亦农，工农结合的办法，根据搬运装卸工作的需要，抽出四十名社员成立了社会主义工农协作跃进队。跃进队在车站附近种了五十亩试验田，并建立了一个养猪场搞养猪副业和积肥，有装卸车任务时去装卸车，没有装卸车时就搞农业。队员既是生产员又是交通运输员，这样既不影响农业生产，又保证了运输需要。
    不久，官亭乡成立人民公社。党中央提出年底要生产一千零七十万吨钢的伟大号召，公社投入了炼钢炼铁的高潮，同时又担负着修铁路复线和修水利等任务，将乡里劳动力抽去三千人左右。在这种更大跃进的形势下，原来的组织形式已不能满足需要。为了保证全面跃进，党委又进行了研究，从8月20日起结合民兵训练的任务，从全乡民兵中抽出十八岁到二十五岁的青年一百二十人，组成了工、农、兵交通运输战斗连，下设三个排九个班，委派了连长、指导员、排长、班长等职，并在车站附近村庄腾出一部分房子集体住宿。全体人员生活集体化，组织军事化，行动战斗化。自己种了“元帅田”（原试验田）七百亩，开办了炼钢厂机械厂等五个企业。收入全部归社，全部人员实行评分制度。原来的两员变为四员，即生产员、交通运输员、战斗员和安全保卫员。
    这种组织形式成立和发展以来，已逐步显示出它的优越性。今年这个连的“元帅田”红薯每亩可收十万斤，玉米估计每亩收七千斤以上，现在正集中搞深翻土地，保证明年放出小麦高产“卫星”。官亭车站的堵塞现象也根本解决了，各项运输指标都有了好转，作到来多少卸多少，卸多少搬多少，有多少装多少，经常保持着货位畅通，满足了工农业大跃进对运输的需要。
    在实践过程中，我们体会到工农兵交通运输战斗连是保证工农业全面大跃进的社会主义的新的组织形式。这种形式是符合全党全民办交通运输的方针的。由于工农兵交通运输战斗连溶工农兵运输于一体，既抓了农业、工业，又保证了运输先行，不仅真正出现了全面跃进的局面，而且对培养共产主义的人才也是有好处的。
