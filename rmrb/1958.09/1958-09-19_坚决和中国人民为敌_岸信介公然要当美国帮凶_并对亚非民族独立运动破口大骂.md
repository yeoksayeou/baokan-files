Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: According to a report in the London "Times" on the 16th, Nobusuke Kishi reiterated to the newspaper's Tokyo correspondent his determination to rely on the United States, resolutely be an enemy of the Chinese people, and oppose the national liberation movements of the people of Asia and Africa.

When the reporter asked Kishi about the situation in the Taiwan Strait, he stated, "No matter what the situation, Japan will always stand on the side of the 'free countries,' and it will never be pro-communist or neutral."

As everyone knows, prior to this, Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, in a joint communique issued after talks with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, had already publicly announced to the world that the Kishi government was willing to act as an accomplice of the United States in launching aggressive wars. Now, Nobusuke Kishi openly comes forward himself to reiterate his intention to stand with the United States and actively support the U.S. war provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait region. This fully proves that Japanese militarists are attempting to participate once again in the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against China in order to achieve their despicable goal of making a fortune by relying on the blood of the Chinese people, just as they did during the U.S. war of aggression against Korea.

When talking about the national liberation movements in Asia and Africa, Nobusuke Kishi superficially and hypocritically said that he "sympathized" with the "feelings" of the Arab people's nationalist movements, and even admitted that "the pursuit of freedom by backward countries is a fundamental and historical need." However, he launched a tirade against the national liberation movements of the people of Asia and Africa to strive for freedom, calling them "excessively radical." He said that he did not recognize the current radical form of Middle Eastern nationalism; it often conflicts with the interests of "free countries," and he declared that he would try to "guide" it and "prevent it from joining hands with communism."

Kishi's above remarks have made the people of Asia and Africa fully aware of the latent imperialist essence of Japan represented by Nobusuke Kishi. His remarks convincingly prove that the "member of Asia and Africa" diplomatic policy repeatedly promoted by the Kishi government in the past was nothing more than a fig leaf to cover up the Kishi government's hostility towards national independence movements and the people of Asia and Africa.

    坚决和中国人民为敌
    岸信介公然要当美国帮凶
    并对亚非民族独立运动破口大骂
    新华社18日讯　据伦敦“泰晤士报”16日报道，岸信介向这家报纸驻东京的记者再次表示了他坚决投靠美国、坚决与中国人民为敌并且反对亚非人民的民族解放运动的态度。
    岸信介在记者问到他对台湾海峡局势的问题时表示，“不管形势如何，日本总是同‘自由国家’站在一边，它永远也不会亲共或者中立”。
    大家知道，在此之前，日本外务相藤山爱一郎在同美国国务卿杜勒斯会谈后发表的联合公报中，就已经向全世界公开宣布岸信介政府甘心充当美国进行侵略战争的帮凶。现在，岸信介公然亲自出马再次表示要同美国站在一起，积极支持美国在台湾海峡地区对中国人民进行的战争挑衅，这就充分证明了日本军国主义者企图再一次参预美帝国主义侵略中国的战争阴谋，以图达到其依靠中国人民的鲜血大发横财的卑鄙目的，像它在美国侵朝战争时期一样。
    岸信介在谈到亚非民族解放运动的时候，表面上虚伪地说他“同情”阿拉伯人民的民族主义运动的“感情”，甚至承认“落后国家寻求自由是一种根本的、历史性的需要”。但是，他却破口大骂亚非人民争取自由的民族解放运动“过分激烈”。他说，他不承认目前这种激烈形式的中东民族主义运动；它常常同“自由国家”的利益相抵触，并且声言他要设法加以“引导”，“防止它同共产主义携手”。
    岸信介的上述谈话使亚非人民充分认识到以岸信介为代表的日本潜在的帝国主义本质。他的谈话，令人信服地证明了过去岸信介政府一再宣扬的“亚非的一员”的外交政策，只不过是为了掩盖岸信介政府敌视民族独立运动，敌视亚非人民的一块遮羞布而已。
