    What Problems Can the Commonwealth Economic Conference Solve?
    By our reporter Su Lan
    A large delegation led by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has gone to Montreal, Canada to attend the Commonwealth Economic Conference. Before the delegation even left London, the "Manchester Guardian" predicted: "A surprisingly large delegation, consisting of very important figures, is going to attend a conference that is unlikely to accomplish anything substantial." This conference was originally proposed by the Canadian Prime Minister last year, hoping to resolve trade issues between Commonwealth countries, mainly Canada and the UK. However, due to profound changes in the capitalist world economy over the past year, the conference has had to shift its focus to two pressing issues: how to eliminate the disastrous effects of falling raw material prices on Commonwealth countries, and how to find new sources of capital to "develop the economies of Commonwealth countries."

    Why are these two issues particularly pressing at the moment and listed as the main agenda of the conference?

    The deepening and spread of the US economic crisis has caused a decline of about 5% in world capitalist trade within a year; and the decline in production has led to a sharp drop in raw material prices. This has hit Commonwealth countries that produce raw materials the hardest. The foreign trade of these countries often relies on one or two raw material exports. For example, in Australia, wool exports account for 45% of its total exports; tea accounts for 63% of Ceylon's total exports; rubber accounts for 51% of Malaya's; and butter accounts for 21% of New Zealand's. However, comparing the first six months of 1958 with the same period last year, wool prices fell by 20%-30%, rubber fell by 10%-20%, tin fell by 10%, and butter fell by 10%-20%. As for copper, it fell from £420 per ton in early 1956 to £160 per ton in early 1958. The drop in raw material prices is so alarming that it cannot but have a serious impact on the foreign exchange income of these countries, greatly increasing their trade deficits. It suffices to mention the situation in New Zealand and India. In the previous trade year (July 1956 to June 1957), New Zealand had a trade surplus of £6.9 million. But in no time at all, the situation completely changed: in the trade year from July 1957 to June 1958, its trade deficit reached a high of £59.7 million. India's foreign exchange reserves have fallen by 37.6% in the last eight months.

    Trade deficits not only brought financial crises to these Commonwealth countries, but also immediately impacted their production sectors, forcing them to close some factories and mines and tighten investment. For example, India reduced investment in its second five-year plan by 300 million rupees.

    What does this series of problems mean for Britain? First, Britain's exports to the Sterling Area account for almost half of its total exports. In order to overcome financial difficulties, Commonwealth countries have begun to take strict import restrictions, which will inevitably affect Britain's exports. In fact, British exports to these countries have already declined in the first half of this year. Second, the huge trade deficits of these countries mean that the entire Commonwealth gold and dollar reserves will be sharply reduced. Macmillan has expressed anxiety about this. He said: The Sterling Area's gold and dollar reserves account for only 4% of the capitalist world's reserves, but it undertakes 40% of the foreign trade volume in the capitalist world, which is "unrealistic." Third, Commonwealth countries are urgently seeking new loans, and if Britain does not come forward to "help" these countries, then Britain's economic ties with them will become increasingly loose, and the disintegrating Commonwealth will inevitably further collapse. Unfortunately, Britain is currently unable to protect itself. If one understands the fact that Britain owes Sterling Area countries as much as $9 billion in its balance of payments, it can be seen how ridiculous Britain's claim to "help" Commonwealth countries is.

    How will the Montreal Conference solve these problems? How to reconcile the conflict of interests between Britain and Commonwealth countries (for example, Britain will inevitably oppose import restrictions by Commonwealth countries)? It seems that even the British government has doubts about this. Britain's only plan now is to keep an eye on Uncle Sam, who is experiencing an economic crisis, and hope to get a huge loan from the United States. When Macmillan visited the United States in June this year, he had already made this request to Eisenhower. A month ago, Eisenhower announced that the United States would consider increasing the funds of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which made Britain overjoyed and pinned all its hopes for the Montreal Conference on the United States. British newspapers have asserted: Whether it is to stabilize raw material prices, to establish a Commonwealth bank as suggested by Britain, or to "develop" Commonwealth countries - without the participation of the United States, "nothing can be accomplished." The conclusion of these newspapers is that the solution to the problem is not the current Montreal Conference, but the International Monetary Fund Conference to be held in New Delhi in October this year.

    However, by that time, Britain will be forced to consider another problem: if the United States really provides "assistance" to the Commonwealth, what price will Britain pay?

### 英联邦经济会议能解决什么问题？

    英联邦经济会议能解决什么问题？
    本报记者　苏蓝
    由英国财政大臣率领的庞大代表团，已经赴加拿大的蒙特利尔参加英联邦经济会议。当这个代表团尚未离开伦敦的时候，“曼彻斯特卫报”就预言：“一个惊人庞大的、可以说是由极重要人物组成的代表团将去出席一个简直搞不出什么名堂来的会议。”这次会议原是加拿大总理在去年建议召开的，是希望通过它来解决英联邦国家之间，主要是加、英之间的贸易问题。但在过去一年中，由于资本主义世界经济发生了深刻的变化，使这次会议不得不转而讨论目前迫在眉睫的两个问题，那就是：如何消除由于原料价格下跌而对联邦国家所引起的灾难性的影响，以及如何寻找新的资本来源，来“开发联邦国家的经济”。
    为什么这两个问题在目前显得特别紧迫，而被列为会议的主要议程呢？
    美国经济危机的加深与蔓延，使得资本主义世界的贸易在一年中下降了5％左右；而生产的下降，又造成原料价格的猛烈下跌。这就使得生产原料的联邦国家首当其冲，遭到严重打击。这些国家的对外贸易，往往依赖一种或两种原料输出。比如，在澳大利亚，羊毛出口占其总输出的45％；锡兰的茶占其总输出的63％；马来亚的橡胶占51％；新西兰的牛油占21％。但以1958年头六个月和去年同期相比，羊毛价格下跌了20％—30％，橡胶下跌了10％—20％，锡下跌了10％，牛油下跌了10％—20％。至于铜，竟从1956年初每吨四百二十英镑，下跌到1958年初的一百六十英镑。原料价格下跌的幅度如此惊人，这就不能不对这些国家的外汇收入发生严重影响，贸易赤字大大增加。只要提一下新西兰和印度的情况就够了。在上一贸易年度（1956年7月到1957年6月）中，新西兰有六百九十万英镑的贸易结余。但曾几何时，情况完全改变：在1957年7月到1958年6月的贸易年度中，它的贸易逆差高达五千九百七十万英镑。印度的外汇储存，在最近的八个月中，下跌了37.6％。
    贸易逆差不仅为这些联邦国家带来了财政危机，而且立即冲击到它们的生产领域，使它们不得不关闭一些工厂和矿山，并紧缩投资。例如印度就把第二个五年计划的投资缩小了三亿卢比。
    这一系列问题，对英国意味着什么呢？第一，英国对英镑区的输出，几乎占其总输出的一半。联邦国家为了克服财政上的困难，已开始采取严格限制进口的措施，这就势必影响到英国的出口。事实上，今年上半年英国对这些国家的输出，已经下降。第二，这些国家贸易逆差的庞大，意味着整个英联邦黄金美元储备将会锐减。麦克米伦已为此表示焦急不安。他说：英镑区的黄金和美元储备，只占资本主义世界储备的4％，但它承担的对外贸易量，在资本主义世界中却占40％，这种情况是“不现实的”。第三，联邦国家正在迫切地寻找新的贷款，如果英国不出头来“帮助”这些国家，那么英国与它们的经济联系将愈加松弛，正在解体中的英联邦势必进一步瓦解。不幸的是，英国目前正自身难保。如果了解到英镑支付平衡中英国欠英镑区国家的债务竟达九十亿美元这一事实，就可以看出，英国的所谓“帮助”联邦国家的说法是多么可笑。
    蒙特利尔会议将怎样来解决这些问题？怎样来调和英国和联邦国家之间的利害冲突（比如，英国势必反对联邦国家限制进口）？看来，连英国政府也对此表示怀疑。英国现在唯一的打算是，把眼盯在正经历着经济危机的山姆大叔身上，希望从美国得到一笔巨额贷款。当麦克米伦今年6月访美时，就已经向艾森豪威尔提出了这一要求。一个月以前，艾森豪威尔宣布美国将考虑增加国际货币基金委员会和世界银行的基金时，更使英国不胜欣喜，把蒙特利尔会议的全部希望寄托在美国身上。英国的报纸已经断言：不论是稳定原料价格也好，像英国所建议的成立联邦银行也好，以及“开发”联邦国家也好——没有美国的参加，“什么也干不成。”这些报纸的结论是：解决问题的不是现在的蒙特利尔会议，而是今年10月在新德里召开的国际货币基金会议。
    但是，到那个时候，英国将被迫考虑另一个难题：假如美国果真对英联邦予以“援助”，英国将付出什么样的代价？
