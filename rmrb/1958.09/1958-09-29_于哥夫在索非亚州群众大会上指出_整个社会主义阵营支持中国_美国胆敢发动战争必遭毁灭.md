Yugov Points Out at Mass Meeting in Sofia Province That The Entire Socialist Camp Supports China
If the United States Dares to Launch a War, It Will Inevitably Be Destroyed
Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 27th -- Yugov, member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, said today at a mass meeting that if American imperialism dares to provoke a war in the Far East, then the powerful force of 600 million Chinese people, with the firm support of the great Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, will deliver a head-on blow to them. He said that a new war conflict would mean the complete failure and destruction of imperialism, especially American imperialism.
    A grand mass rally was held today in Radomir, Sofia Province, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the soldiers' uprising and the founding of the Radomir Republic in 1918. Forty years ago today, under the influence of the October Revolution, Bulgarian soldiers opposed the imperialist slaughter of the First World War, revolted in Radomir, and established the Republic. Bulgarian party and government leaders such as Zhivkov attended this celebration rally.
    Speaking at the meeting, Yugov angrily condemned the shameless aggressive provocations of American imperialism against the Chinese people. He said that Taiwan and other coastal islands of China are an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and no force can deprive the Chinese people of their right to recover this part of great China. The American aggressors must get out of Taiwan.
    In his speech, Yugov also condemned the recent activities of the Yugoslav modern revisionists in spreading hatred and chauvinism among the people of the Balkan countries. He pointed out that this once again proves that the struggle of the communist and workers' parties of all countries against Yugoslav revisionism is correct and necessary.
    The congress finally passed a congratulatory telegram to the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and a protest telegram to the United Nations. In a telegram to the United Nations, the congress condemned the despicable aggressive provocations of American imperialism against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Straits area, demanded that the United Nations take resolute measures to stop the aggressive and provocative crimes of American imperialism in the Taiwan Straits, and forced the American aggressor troops to withdraw from Taiwan immediately.

    兄弟国家坚决同我们站在一起
    于哥夫在索非亚州群众大会上指出
    整个社会主义阵营支持中国
    美国胆敢发动战争必遭毁灭
    新华社索非亚27日电  保共中央政治局委员、部长会议主席于哥夫今天在一个群众大会上说，如果美帝国主义胆敢在远东挑起战争，那么，得到伟大的苏联和整个社会主义阵营坚决支持的六亿中国人民的强大力量将给他们以当头棒喝。他说，一次新的战争冲突，将意味着帝国主义、特别是美国帝国主义的彻底失败和毁灭。
    今天在索非亚州拉多米尔市举行了盛大群众集会，隆重庆祝1918年的士兵起义和拉多米尔共和国成立四十周年。四十年前的今天，在十月革命的影响下，保加利亚士兵反对第一次世界大战的帝国主义屠杀，在拉多米尔起义并且成立了共和国。保加利亚党和政府领导人日夫科夫等出席了这个庆祝集会。
    于哥夫在会上讲话时，愤怒谴责了美帝国主义对中国人民的无耻侵略挑衅。他说，台湾及中国其他沿海岛屿是中国领土不可分割的一部分，任何力量都不能剥夺中国人民收复伟大中国的这一部分领土的权利。美国侵略者必须从台湾滚出去。
    于哥夫在讲话中还谴责南斯拉夫现代修正主义者最近在巴尔干各国人民中间散布仇恨和沙文主义的勾当。他指出，这再一次证明，各国共产党和工人党进行反对南斯拉夫修正主义的斗争是正确的和必要的。
    大会最后通过了致保共中央的贺电和致联合国的抗议电报。大会在给联合国的电报中，谴责了美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区对中国人民的卑劣的侵略挑衅，要求联合国采取坚决措施制止美帝国主义在台湾海峡的侵略挑衅罪行，迫使美国侵略军立即撤出台湾。
