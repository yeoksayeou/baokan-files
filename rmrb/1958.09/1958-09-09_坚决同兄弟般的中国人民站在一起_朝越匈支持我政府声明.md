Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th September: Premier Kim Il-sung of the North Korean Cabinet stated at the Pyongyang rally celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the 8th that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait.

Kim Il-sung said that the U.S. imperialists have illegally occupied Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, which are inalienable territories of the People's Republic of China, and recently they have conspiratorially used these areas as springboards to expand their aggression against the People's Republic of China.

Kim Il-sung said that the provocations of the U.S. imperialists against the People's Republic of China are a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world, and also a provocation against all peace-loving people in Asia.

Kim Il-sung pointed out that the Taiwan issue is entirely China's internal affair, and the liberation of Taiwan is China's inviolable right.

Kim Il-sung stated that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people resolutely condemn the provocative acts of the U.S. imperialists who interfere in China's internal affairs, infringe upon China's territory and sovereignty, and exacerbate tensions in the Taiwan Strait.

Premier Kim Il-sung also said that in the struggle against the U.S. imperialists' policy of war and in defense of peace and security in Asia, the Korean people will stand together with the fraternal Chinese people and will further strengthen the solidarity between the peoples of the two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th September: Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announced tonight at a reception held by the Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to Vietnam to celebrate the Korean National Day that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly supports the statement issued by Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China on the 6th regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait.

In his speech, Pham Van Dong said that the Vietnamese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Korean people to reunify their fatherland. The Vietnamese people believe that the struggle of the Korean and Vietnamese people to drive the U.S. interventionists out of South Korea and South Vietnam will surely be victorious.

Korean Ambassador to Vietnam Choe Chang-chol condemned the provocative acts of the United States in the Taiwan Strait in his speech. He said that the United States must immediately cease its aggressive and arrogant interference in China's sacred and inviolable territory of Taiwan.

Choe Chang-chol said that the friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and Vietnam are constantly being consolidated and developed. He said that no force can shake our firm will to fight for peace and socialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 8th September: Mátyás Rákosi, Member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee and Minister of State of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, delivered a speech at a mass rally on the 7th, condemning the provocative activities of U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait. He said that the provocations of U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan region are an attempt to obstruct the liberation of its own territory by People's China, a member of the socialist camp.

He said that when Hungary was in its most difficult moment during the counter-revolutionary events of 1956, the Chinese people gave the Hungarian people tremendous help. We tell the 600 million Chinese people at today's rally: Not only the Hungarian communists, but also all the working people of Hungary resolutely support the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan.

Mátyás Rákosi made this statement at the Miner's Day celebration held in Salgótarján.
