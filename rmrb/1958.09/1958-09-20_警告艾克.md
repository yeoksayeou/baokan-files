Warning to Eisenhower
Li Zhanwu

Eisenhower, open your eyes and look! Six hundred million Chinese people, raising twelve hundred million iron fists, are angrily rebuking you:

	American aggressor troops, get out!
	Get out of our sacred territory—Taiwan!

Eisenhower, don't you believe it? Look: our heroic soldiers are fiercely firing, giant cannons are roaring towards the Chiang bandits, and flocks of "Divine Eagles" are majestically reconnoitering and circling in the sea and air,迎击敌机的侵犯。 Our worker brothers are炼钢铁 day and night, and our farmer brothers are working hard and practically to busy with丰产。 The militiamen are full of fighting spirit, practicing their skills, ready to go to the front line at any time when the motherland needs them. Poets are握紧笔的武器, and painters are拿起画具和色盘。 All for the sake of defending our great motherland, all for the sake of defending the sovereignty of the motherland and fighting bravely!

Tell you, Eisenhower, atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs cannot scare the Chinese people. Dulles's clamoring, your television speeches, are nothing but the insane expressions of war maniacs. Eisenhower, you must know that the Chinese people have long stood up. In front of this giant of New China, you appear so ugly, simply like a瘪三. Now is the era when the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, and our socialist camp is united as one. Peace-loving people all over the world also stand on our side. The Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to the war provocations of the United States, because invading China is invading the Soviet Union. The pig snout of the colonialists cannot插进黎巴嫩和约旦, nor can it插进 anyone's庄园.

I warn you, Eisenhower, the solemn statement of our government is a hydrogen bomb in return to you. If you dare to impose war on the heads of the Chinese people, be careful of the iron fists of the Chinese people, who will surely捶得稀烂 the American invaders! Jinmen and Matsu will surely be liberated, and our sacred territory of Taiwan will surely be liberated!

    警告艾克
  　李沾吾艾克，你睁眼看看，中国六万万人民，高举十二万万铁拳，怒火冲冲斥责你：
  美国侵略军滚出去，
  滚出我国的神圣领土——台
    湾！艾克，你不相信吗？请看：我们英勇的战士们在猛烈射击，巨炮朝着蒋贼呼啸，“神鹰”群在海空雄伟地侦察盘
  旋，迎击敌机的侵犯。我们工人兄弟日夜炼钢铁，农民兄弟苦干实干忙丰产。民兵们斗志昂扬练本领，一旦祖国需要随时准备上前线。诗人们握紧笔的武器，画家们拿起画具和色盘。一切为了保卫我们的伟大祖国，一切为了保卫祖国的主权而奋
    战！告诉你，艾克，原子弹氢弹吓不倒中国人民。杜勒斯的叫嚣，你的电视演说，不过是战争狂人的疯癫表现。艾克，你要知道，中国人民早就站立起来了。在新中国这个巨人面前，你显得多么丑陋，简直像个瘪三。现在是东风压倒西风的时代，我们社会主义阵营团结无间。全世界爱好和平的人民
  也站在我们一边。苏联对于美国的战争挑衅，
  决不能置之不理，因为侵略中国就是侵略苏联。殖民主义者的猪嘴，插不进黎巴嫩和约旦，也插不进任何人家的庄园。警告你，艾克，我国政府的庄严声明，是向你回敬的一枚氢弹。你胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头
  上，小心着中国人民的铁拳，一定把美国强盗捶得稀烂！金门、马祖一定解放，也一定解放我国的神圣领土——
  台湾！
