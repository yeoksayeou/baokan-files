Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, September 9th: The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Zhejiang, including land, sea, and air forces, have held meetings to express their determination to fight to the end to defend the motherland's territory, territorial waters, and airspace, and to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan.

The land and naval forces guarding the Zhoushan Islands, with immense anger, demonstrated and paraded with the local people. Luo Shirong, the political instructor of the "Red One Company" and a third-class people's hero, told the masses: If the U.S. imperialist troops do not get out of Taiwan and impose war on the Chinese people, we will resolutely wipe them out completely. Liu Changde, a navigator on a naval vessel, said at a mass meeting that our territory must be liberated. As long as the motherland issues an order, our ships can set sail immediately, just like liberating Toumenshan and Yijiangshan Islands, and completely annihilate the enemy.

The air force units stationed in Zhejiang, which had severely struck U.S.-made Chiang aircraft, were indignant at the military provocations of U.S. imperialism. They said: In the past, we heavily taught U.S.-made Chiang aircraft a lesson in the skies off the coast of Zhejiang. Today, we are even stronger, with better equipment, and our pilots have even higher combat skills. If U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war, we will definitely make sure they come but never leave.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 8th: In recent days, the sea, land, and air forces of the People's Liberation Army in the Shenyang area have been filled with righteous indignation, resolutely stating that they will not give up until they have crushed the war provocations of the American aggressors and liberated the territory of the motherland.

Since the evening of the 6th, the troops have enthusiastically participated in local rallies and parades. Leaders of the troops and combat heroes solemnly assured the people of the motherland at mass meetings: Wherever the motherland needs us, we will go, and we are ready to give the enemy a head-on blow at any time. Air Force hero Zhang Jihui said: Our people's soldiers will not spare their blood, and we will certainly be able to resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate the aggressors.

These days, the officers and soldiers of the naval forces are waiting with increased vigilance for the orders of the motherland. A soldier, Wang Xianchen, said in a poem: I am a Chinese navy man, and it is my sacred duty to defend the motherland. If imperialism dares to take risks, we will bury them in the sea.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 8th: The People's Liberation Army units in the Jinan area expressed extreme anger at the war threats and military provocations by U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area, and are determined to fight to the end for the liberation of Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan.

On the evening of the 6th, the troops held meetings to warmly support Premier Zhou's statement. The representatives attending the Jinan area troops' party congress unanimously expressed their determination to use practical actions to fight back against the war provocations of U.S. imperialism. Colonel Qi Qianzhai said: We are the defenders of the motherland. We love peace, but we are never afraid of war. If the enemy dares to launch a war, we will fight to the end to defend the motherland's territory, territorial waters, and airspace, and to liberate the motherland's territory of Taiwan.

The naval forces stationed in Qingdao unanimously expressed their determination to contribute their strength to the liberation of Taiwan and the defense of the motherland. In recent days, they have been actively training and strengthening their combat readiness, ready to respond to the motherland's orders and strike the aggressors at any time.

Troops in Jinan, Qingdao, and other places also held demonstrations and parades with the local people. Some troops sent out propaganda vehicles and propaganda teams to express to the people their determination and will to defend and liberate every inch of the motherland's territory.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 9th: The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tianjin held a meeting on the 8th, strongly protesting the provocative behavior of American warships that blatantly disregarded the solemn warnings of our government and repeatedly intruded into our territorial waters. They unanimously stated: If U.S. imperialism does not immediately get out of our territorial waters, the serious danger of being buried at sea awaits them. Second Lieutenant Zhang Xiange, an air force hero who shot down American planes on the Korean battlefield, said that U.S. imperialism is just a paper tiger. If it does not heed the warnings of the Chinese people, we will make it crawl in and roll out.

In recent days, troops of various services stationed in Tianjin have held meetings and parades, stepped up combat training in "one person with multiple skills," "one soldier with multiple uses," and "one specialty with multiple capabilities," preparing to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and severely strike the aggressors.
