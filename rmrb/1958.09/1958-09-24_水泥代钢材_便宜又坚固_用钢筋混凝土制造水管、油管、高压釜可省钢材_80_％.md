Cement Replaces Steel: Cheap and Sturdy
Reinforced Concrete for Water Pipes, Oil Pipes, and Autoclaves Can Save 80% of Steel

    (Our report) A significant new technology in industrial construction—prestressed reinforced concrete pressure water pipes—has been successfully developed through the joint efforts of the Beijing Municipal Engineering Design Institute, the Beijing Water Supply and Sewerage Engineering Bureau, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, and the Cement Products Research Institute. The manufactured water pipes range in diameter from a minimum of 150 millimeters to a maximum of 1,400 millimeters. During testing, single pipe sections withstood a water pressure of 20 kilograms without any signs of dampness, and a 24-meter-long test section withstood a water pressure of 14 kilograms without leakage. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has decided to formally apply this new technological achievement in pipeline construction to the water supply projects of large-scale integrated enterprises such as Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel. The use of this type of non-metallic water pipe in such large-scale integrated enterprises is a world first.

    The emergence of prestressed reinforced concrete pressure water pipes marks a leap forward in China's pipeline engineering technology. The use of prestressed concrete pipes in industrial and civil building water supply pipelines can generally save 60% to 90% of steel and reduce costs by 10% to 30%. In construction projects, pipeline steel consumption typically accounts for about 20% of the total steel used in construction.

    Prestressed concrete pipes also have higher corrosion resistance, resulting in a longer service life and lower maintenance costs. The service life of ordinary steel pipes is generally around 30 years, while that of prestressed concrete pipes can reach over 70 years.

    (Our report) China's first prestressed reinforced concrete high-pressure oil pipeline was successfully trial-produced at the Liaoyang Cement Products Factory recently.

    This non-metallic high-pressure oil pipeline has undergone water pressure and structural testing, and its performance is exceptionally good. It has a compressive strength of 36 atmospheres per square centimeter, does not rupture or leak, and can completely replace seamless steel pipes for transporting crude oil.

    Using this type of oil pipeline can save 80% of steel and reduce costs by about 35% compared to using seamless steel pipes. (Liaoyang Daily Editorial Department)

    (Our report) The Reinforced Concrete Structure Research Laboratory of the China Academy of Building Research has recently successfully trial-produced an autoclave using prestressed concrete to replace steel plates. This autoclave does not leak water or air at a pressure of eight atmospheres and a temperature of 174 degrees Celsius, and its performance is good.

    Compared with steel autoclaves, this type of autoclave is expected to save about 80% of steel.

    Autoclaves are important equipment for manufacturing silicate products. The use of prestressed concrete for autoclaves not only opens up a new field for the application of prestressed concrete, but also creates conditions for the large-scale construction of silicate factories in China.

    水泥代钢材　便宜又坚固
    用钢筋混凝土制造水管、油管、高压釜可省钢材80％
    本报讯　工业建设中一项重大的新技术——预应力钢筋混凝土压力水管，经北京市政工程设计院、北京上下水道工程局、冶金工业部、化学工业部、建筑工程部及水泥制品研究院等单位共同研究试制成功。试制成功的水管管径最小的一百五十公厘，最大的一千四百公厘。试验压力在单根管段试压时做到了二十公斤水压无潮点出现，在试铺二十四公尺长管试压时做到了十四公斤水压不渗水。冶金工业部决定把这一项管道技术上的新成就正式应用于包钢、武钢等大型联合企业的供水工程上。在这样规模的联合企业中采用这种非金属水管，在世界上还属创举。
    预应力钢筋混凝土压力水管的出现，标志着我国管道工程技术的一次飞跃发展。在工业和民用建筑供水管道采用预应力混凝土管，一般可以节约钢铁60％到90％，降低成本10％到30％。而在建筑工程中管道耗用钢铁材料一般约占全部建筑用钢量的20％左右。
    预应力混凝土管还有较高的抗侵蚀性，因此使用寿命长，维修费用少。一般钢管使用年限一般约为三十年，而预应力混凝土管的寿命则可达七十年以上。
    本报讯　我国第一根预应力钢筋混凝土高压输油管，不久前在辽阳水泥制品厂试制成功。
    这种非金属高压输油管经水压和结构试验，性能异常良好，它每平方公分抗压能力达三十六个气压，不破裂、不渗水，完全可以代替无缝钢管输送原油。
    采用这种输油管比使用无缝钢管可以节约钢铁80％，降低造价35％左右。　（辽阳日报编辑部）
    本报讯　建筑工程部建筑科学研究院加筋混凝土结构研究室最近采用预应力混凝土代替钢板来试制高压釜成功。这种高压釜在八个大气压和摄氏一百七十四度温度下不渗水不漏气，工作性能良好。
    这种高压釜和钢制的高压釜相比，预计可以节省钢材80％左右。
    高压釜是制造矽酸盐制品的重要设备。用预应力混凝土制高压釜，不仅为预应力混凝土的应用开辟了一个新的领域，还为我国大批建设矽酸盐工厂创造了条件。
