Xinhua News Agency, September 24th.

    The People's Navy fighters guarding the motherland's coastline have held numerous rallies in recent days to support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, determined to fight to the end to defend the motherland's territorial waters and the integrity of the motherland's sovereignty and territory.
    Naval soldiers fighting on the Fujian front have held countless mobilization rallies in the past four days, denouncing Dulles' shameless nonsense and preparing to strike the American warmongers with the most resolute actions. Wang Hui, the captain of a gunboat who won a collective second-class merit in pre-battle training, said: The responsibility of a sailor is to protect the motherland's territorial waters from invasion. If Jinmen, Mazu and Taiwan are not liberated for a single day, the sailor's heart will be like a stormy sea, and it will not be calm for a single day. He led the soldiers to revise the pre-battle training plan and determined to refine their skills and severely strike the invading enemy.
    All the commanders and fighters of the East Sea Fleet warned the warmongers: Atomic blackmail cannot scare the 600 million Chinese people. The sailors of Ship No. 1 and Ship No. 4 of a certain unit said: Foreign Minister Chen's statement is like a demon-revealing mirror, once again exposing the aggressive nature of American imperialism. Our sacred duty is to defend the motherland. If American imperialism dares to impose war on us, we will let it taste the "iron rations" specially prepared for it. After the meetings, many sailors wrote letters of request to go to the front line and fiercely attack the American robbers. The officers and soldiers of a certain warship jointly stated in a letter of determination to their superiors: We will never allow American invaders to occupy an inch of our territory. We are ready, and we can crush the enemy to pieces and die in the ocean at any time.
    The sailors stationed in Lushunkou are all eager to try, ready and waiting. They said: Our liberation of our own territory has nothing to do with the United States. Dulles' clamor for a "ceasefire" is complete nonsense. We demand that the American troops immediately get out of Taiwan, otherwise we will use the most resolute actions to drive them away.
    The sailors stationed in the Qingdao base and the coastal areas of Guangdong, under the slogan of "let the arsonists bury themselves in the fire", launched a comprehensive military training exercise. Everyone expressed in high spirits: As long as the motherland gives an order, we will immediately ride the wind and waves, drive the "Sea Eagle", and severely punish the invaders.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, September 23rd. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang, including the army, navy, and air force, warmly supports the statement of Foreign Minister Chen Yi.
    The artillery soldiers guarding Dongtou Island said angrily: If the American warmongers ignore the repeated warnings of our people and dare to provoke a war, we will use artillery shells to bury them deeply on the seabed. Colonel Li Heng of a naval unit, who had fought against the American invading army on the Korean battlefield, said: "American imperialism was our loser on the Korean battlefield. We have the right and the full power to defend our territorial waters and airspace and liberate our own motherland's territory." Zhi Jikai, the instructor of a naval unit, said: "We receive letters of determination and applications from soldiers every day. They express their determination to liberate Jinmen, Mazu and Taiwan. This is the will of all Chinese people. This is our country's internal affairs. No one can stop it. Dulles has no right to speak at all!"
    Protest letters, letters of determination, poems, and big-character posters from officers and soldiers are posted everywhere in the air force units. Aviation soldiers, radar soldiers, searchlight soldiers, and anti-aircraft artillery soldiers are all sticking to their battle posts, standing by, ready to strike the invaders at any time. Ma Yanfeng, the captain of an air force unit who shot down three American planes on the Korean battlefield, said: "Dulles' shameless nonsense is just playing the trick of a thief crying 'stop thief'. We are always ready to listen to the call of the motherland and give the invaders a devastating blow." Captain Sun Menghai said: "We are always ready. As long as there is an order, we will fly into the sky and make the enemy bloom in the air!"

    把海盗埋葬海底  叫飞贼空中开花
    海军战士和驻浙江部队表示反侵略决心
    新华社24日讯  守卫在祖国海岸线上的人民海军战士，连日来纷纷集会拥护陈毅外长的声明，决心为保卫祖国领海，保卫祖国主权和领土的完整而战斗到底。
    在福建前线作战的水兵，四天来举行了无数次誓师大会，痛斥杜勒斯的无耻谰言，准备以最坚决的行动打击美国战争贩子。在敌前练兵中荣立集体二等功的某炮艇艇长王辉说：水兵的责任就是要保卫祖国的领海不受侵犯，金门、马祖和台湾一天不解放，水兵的心就像惊涛骇浪一样，一天也不能平静。他领导战士们重新修订了敌前练兵计划，决心把本领练得精又精，狠狠打击来犯的敌人。
    东海舰队的全体指战员警告战争贩子：原子讹诈是吓不倒六亿中国人民的。某部一号舰和四号舰的水兵说：陈外长的声明像照妖镜一样，又一次把美帝国主义侵略本质照得原形毕露。我们神圣的职责就是保卫祖国，美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，我们就让它尝尝专为它准备的“钢铁干粮”。许多水兵在集会以后，写请战书要求到前线去痛击美国强盗。某军舰的全体官兵联名给上级的决心书上说：我们决不让美国侵略者侵占我国一寸领土，我们已经准备好了，我们随时都可以把敌人打得粉身碎骨，死在海洋。
    驻旅顺口的水兵，个个都磨拳擦掌，整装待命，他们说：我们解放自己的领土与美国毫无相干，杜勒斯叫嚣的“停火”，完全是胡说八道，我们要求美国军队立即滚出台湾，否则我们就要用最坚决的行动把它赶走。
    驻青岛基地和广东沿海地区的水兵，在“让玩火者葬身火中”的口号下，展开了全面的军事练兵，每个人都精神抖擞地表示：只要祖国一声命令，马上乘风破浪，驾着“海鹰”，去严惩侵略者。
    新华社杭州23日电  人民解放军驻浙江陆海空军热烈拥护陈毅外交部长的声明。
    守卫在洞头岛的炮兵战士们愤怒地说：如果美国战争贩子不顾我国人民一再警告，胆敢挑起战争，我们就用炮弹把它深深地埋葬在海底下。曾在朝鲜战场上和美国侵略军作过战的海军某部李恒上校说：“美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上就是我们的手下败将，我们有权利也完全有力量保卫我们的领海和领空，解放自己祖国的领土。海军某部指导员直继开说：“我们每天都接到战士写来的决心书、申请书，他们表示要坚决解放金门、马祖和台湾，这是全中国人民的意志，这是我国的内政，谁也阻挡不住，杜勒斯根本没有发言权！”
    在空军部队里到处贴满了官兵们的抗议书、决心书、诗歌和大字报。航空兵、雷达兵，探照灯兵、高射炮兵都坚守在自己的战斗岗位上严阵以待，随时准备打击侵略者。曾在朝鲜战场上打落过三架美国飞机的空军某部大队长马颜峰说：“杜勒斯的无耻谰言只不过是玩弄贼喊捉贼的把戏而已，我们随时准备听候祖国的召唤，给侵略者以毁灭性打击。”大队长孙孟海说：“我们时刻准备着，只要有命令，就飞上天去叫敌人空中开花！”
