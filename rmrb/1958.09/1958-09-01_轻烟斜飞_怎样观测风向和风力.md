　　Wind can help plants cross-pollinate and spread seeds, and winds of level three or higher can also drive windmills to grind flour and generate electricity. However, the disadvantages of wind are also considerable. Strong winds can knock down plants, blow off flowers, fruits, and grains, dry out the soil, and cause agricultural yield reductions. In addition, winds from different directions can indicate certain weather conditions. For example, there is a saying: "An east wind in midsummer means no rain," which uses wind direction to determine whether the weather is good or bad.
　　If we are good at observing the wind and understanding weather forecasts about the wind, we can mitigate or completely avoid the harm to crops by preventing disastrous winds in advance. How to observe and understand? Judging wind direction is relatively simple: stand in an open and flat area and observe for about two minutes, recording the direction from which the wind is blowing in eight directions: east, south, west, north, southeast, northeast, southwest, and northwest. This will give you the wind direction. If you are afraid of not seeing accurately, you can hang a small silk ribbon on a high pole. If the ribbon is blown to the southeast, it means it is a northwest wind, and so on.
　　It is even more interesting to look at wind force and wind speed. The meteorological station often forecasts what level of wind there will be tomorrow. How strong is each level of wind? Can we judge the level of wind with our eyes? Yes. Here is a jingle for looking at wind force: "Level one wind, light smoke flies diagonally; level two, face feels the wind. Level three, flag flutters; level four, dust dances; level six, accompaniment plays; level five, conductor directs." This means: a level one wind is so light that it can just blow smoke diagonally. A level two wind can just make people feel a breeze on their faces. A level three wind can start to move flags or handkerchiefs. A level four wind can start to blow dust and scraps of paper on the ground, making them spin around like they are having a dance party. A level five wind can make small trees with leaves sway, as if a band conductor is waving a baton. And a level six wind will make the wires hum, as if pulling strings for accompaniment. By remembering this jingle and practicing by comparing it with actual situations, you can independently observe wind force.
　　How can you know the wind speed in meters per second for each level of wind? There is another jingle: "Two is two, and one is one. Level three, three plus one. Four to nine is easy, subtract two from the level and multiply by three." This means the wind speed of a level one wind is about one meter per second (originally 0.3—1.5 meters per second); a level two wind is about two meters per second; a level three wind is about four meters per second. From level four to level nine wind, calculate using the above method. Taking a level six wind as an example, the wind speed should be (6-2)×3=12, which is about twelve meters per second (the original number should be 10.8—13.8 meters per second). Such a rough memory method is sufficient for agriculture and general life. It not only helps us see the wind force and wind speed at the time, but also when listening to the weather forecast, we can have a concrete concept of what a certain level of wind means.

　　轻烟斜飞
　　——怎样观测风向和风力

    风，能帮助植物串花受粉、传播种子，三级以上的风还能推动风车磨粉、发电；但是风的坏处也不少，大风能吹倒植物，吹落花果子粒，吹干土壤，造成农业减产。此外，不同风向的风还能表示一定的天气，譬如有句谚语说：“伏里东风不雨”，就是从风向来看天气的好坏。
    如果我们善于观测风和理解气象台关于风的预报，对灾害性的风事先予以防范，是可以减轻或完全避免它对农作物的危害的。怎样观测和理解呢？判断风向比较简单：站在空旷平坦的地方观测约二分钟，按东、南、西、北、东南、东北、西南、西北等八个方向来记载当时风吹来的方向，就可以得出风向；若怕看的不准，可在高杆上挂一小绸布飘带，飘带被吹向东南，即表示是西北风，余此类推。
    看风力和风速就更有趣了。气象台常预报明天将会有几级风。到底每一级风是多大呢？我们用眼睛能判断出风的级数吗？能。这里有个看风力的口诀：“一级风轻烟斜飞，二级人面感风吹。三展旗、四舞会，六伴奏来五指挥。”意思是说：一级风轻得刚刚能够把烟吹斜。二级风才开始能使人感觉到微风拂面。三级风开始能吹动旗子或手绢。四级风开始能吹动地面的灰尘碎纸，使它们转动起来像开跳舞会一样。五级风可使有叶的小树摇摆，好像乐队指挥在挥动木棒一般。而六级风就会把电线吹得呼呼作响，好像拉琴伴奏一样。记住这个口诀，对照实际情况来练习，就能独立观测风力了。
    怎样能知道每一级风相当每秒几米的风速呢？又有一个口诀：“二是二来一是一，三级三上加个一。四到九级很简单，用级数减二再乘三。”这是说一级风的风速是每秒一米左右（原是0.3—1.5米秒）；二级风是二米秒左右；三级风是四米秒左右。从四到九级风，用上述方法计算。以六级风为例，风速应是（6－2）×3＝12，即十二米秒左右（原数应为10.8—13.8米秒）。这样粗略的记忆法，在农业上与一般生活上已经足够了。它不但帮助我们看出当时的风力风速，同时在收听天气预报时，对几级风就能有个具体概念了。
