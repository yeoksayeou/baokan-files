Seize the Peak Season and Vigorously Purchase Wild Oilseeds
Zhang Yuexia

Wild oilseeds are facing their peak maturity season. Commercial departments need to act quickly and vigorously purchase them to support the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

China's wild oilseed resources are very abundant. As long as a little effort is spent during their growth and reproduction, paying attention to protection and cultivation, and a certain amount of labor is spent on collection during the mature season, a great deal of wealth can be added to the country. According to preliminary investigations, there are more than 400 kinds of wild oilseeds in China, with oil content generally above 15%, and up to 60% at the highest. For example, in areas with advanced processing technology, 100 catties of cocklebur seeds can produce 19.6 catties of oil, exceeding the oil yield of soybeans. Cocklebur seed oil can be used to make paint, ink, mechanical lubricants, and Turkey red oil for softening rayon, and it is also edible. Litsea cubeba oil is a raw material for high-grade fragrances and a very popular export commodity.

The total output of wild oilseeds across the country has not yet been determined. It is estimated that the output of mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, which account for two-thirds of the country's area, can reach about 1.6 billion catties. In 1958, Wuxiang County purchased 800,000 catties, with an average of 5.11 catties collected per person in the county. If this year's purchase target can be achieved, it will be equivalent to 67% of the county's total oilseed purchase volume. The collection, purchase, and transportation alone can increase the income of agricultural cooperatives by more than 50,000 yuan. Shanxi Province plans to purchase 30 million catties this year (the leap forward plans of various counties have set 39 million catties). After deducting the 5 million catties for direct export, the remaining 25 million catties of oil extraction will account for 89.5% of this year's oil transfer task. If we call on the country's 520 million agricultural population to collect 3 catties each, we can collect 1.56 billion catties, which can increase the income of agricultural cooperatives by 78 million yuan (calculated at a price of 5 cents per catty). Extracting oil from these oilseeds, averaging a minimum oil yield of 15%, can produce 234 million catties of oil, which, in addition to completely replacing the edible oil used in industry in 1958, can also provide an additional 74 million catties to support the great leap forward in industrial production this year.

These oilseeds can also support the production of local oil and fat industries. At present, the existing equipment capacity of local oil and fat industries is only utilized by about 70% due to insufficient oilseeds. For example, Darei County in Shanxi Province purchased 800,000 catties of oilseeds this year, which can supply the county's 22 frequently idle oil mills for six months of production, so the county's oil mills can achieve year-round processing. 1.56 billion catties of oilseeds can produce 780 million catties of oil cakes, which can be used to fertilize fields and increase grain production significantly. From this, it can be seen that vigorously collecting wild oilseeds has a huge role in supporting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Conversely, a great deal of wealth will be wasted on the ground.

The main problem at present is that commercial departments at all levels urgently need to rely on the leadership of the Party committee, closely focus on the central work of the Party, and, on the premise of being conducive to realizing the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, propose to the Party committee plans that are conducive to increasing industrial and agricultural production by utilizing wild oilseeds, as well as effective measures to realize the plans. They should report the situation and problems to the Party committee in a timely manner, so that the Party committee can strengthen its leadership over the work of purchasing and utilizing wild oilseeds. All regions that have done this have been welcomed by the Party committee. For example, the commercial department of Darei County in Shanxi Province reported the actual effects of purchasing and utilizing cocklebur seeds to the Party and government, which received the attention of the Party committee. The county magistrate personally explained the importance of purchasing wild oilseeds at the autumn three-level cadre meeting, and assigned the purchase task to lower levels, which aroused the attention of agricultural cooperatives and grassroots cooperatives. In 1957, they conducted a comprehensive survey of wild oilseeds in conjunction with the central task of production and disaster relief, and clarified the resources and key producing areas in the county. Under severe disaster conditions, they also purchased 120,000 catties of wild oilseeds and created conditions for carrying out purchases this year.

How to solve the labor problem of collecting wild oilseeds? Rely on implementing the mass line, vigorously carry out propaganda on the general line, vigorously publicize the political and economic significance of using wild oilseeds to realize the general line, as well as the samples, specifications, and prices of various wild oilseeds; the forms of propaganda can be diverse, but it must be known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, so as to arouse the interest of the masses in collecting. Mobilizing the elderly, women, and children to participate in the collection, then the labor problem can be solved. For example, the Zhangjiagou Agricultural Cooperative in Wuxiang County originally planned that this year, men and women, old and young, over the age of eight, would collect an average of 15 catties per person, striving for 20 catties. Later, after a forum of various labor representatives, they unanimously agreed that it could be increased to an average of 50 catties per person. In addition to auxiliary labor for collection, the main labor force can also carry out a few days of concentrated collection movements in the gaps between busy farming seasons, which will not affect agricultural production, thus increasing the collection plan of the Zhangjiagou Agricultural Cooperative. Wang Gaihuan, the agricultural production team leader of Chengguan Township in this county, last year she brought back more than 180 catties of cocklebur seeds on her way home from work, sold them for 9 yuan, bought a new dress, and subsidized pocket money. This year, she plans to have her family of four collect 1,000 catties, and also organize 70 women in the village to collect 100 catties each, and plans to open up wasteland next year to plant wild oilseeds and study how to transform wild into domesticated. These facts show that as long as the propaganda work is done more deeply, the masses are happy to collect. Therefore, commercial departments should seize the opportunity to carry out propaganda work, promote various advanced models, establish advanced banners, assist agricultural cooperatives in arranging labor, list the collection of wild oilseeds as one of the sideline production activities, assign special personnel to be responsible for it, sign purchase contracts with agricultural cooperatives in a timely manner, and encourage their collection enthusiasm.

In addition to organizing farmers to collect, it is also important to organize social forces to collect; now many regions are combining work-study programs, and commercial departments are signing purchase contracts with schools to mobilize students to collect. This practice is worth promoting. Last year, the commercial department of Jiangsu Province obtained the assistance of the People's Liberation Army and, in a short period of time, launched a concentrated collection of a large amount of Suaeda salsa. This year, we should mobilize all positive factors to work together to complete the collection task and increase the country's oilseed wealth. At the same time, we must also oppose the conservative thinking of those who shout about difficulties without doing serious work.

In order to make full use of wild oilseeds, commercial departments should assist agricultural cooperatives and handicraft departments in vigorously carrying out trial pressing. For example, the Wuxiang County Commercial Bureau provided funds and sent cadres to help solve the processing difficulties of oil mills, vigorously supported the Zhangjiagou Oil Mill in trial pressing cocklebur seeds, relied on the leadership of the township branch, constantly encouraged the enthusiasm of workers, and relied on workers to boldly carry out technological innovation, finally making cocklebur seeds jump from no oil output at the beginning to the current highest oil yield in the country. This experience has universal significance for all wild oilseeds. In order to meet the peak season purchase, we must actively prepare for processing business and strive to catch up with the needs of the purchase task. First of all, we should give full play to the existing processing power, adopt the principle of on-site processing, and try to organize agricultural cooperatives to process, which can not only develop the diversified operations of agricultural cooperatives, but also save transportation costs, and the oil cakes can be returned to the cooperatives for use in a timely manner. If the local agricultural cooperative has no equipment and the industrial department does not have enough time, the commercial department should, based on the principle of making do with whatever is available and combining technological innovation, take small-scale as the main focus and actively run the processing business. Implement the central government's principle of combining large, medium, and small sizes, and supply the varieties that are more advantageous for processing in cities to the cities for processing as much as possible.

The peak maturity season of wild oilseeds is coming soon. Doing everything possible to purchase wild oilseeds is a key issue. Commercial departments should set up purchase networks suitable for different oilseed collectors, which is convenient for the masses to sell and can save costs. Warehouse preparation and training of storage technology also need to be carried out in a corresponding and rhythmic manner.

    抓紧旺季，大力收购野生油料
    张越霞
    野生油料已面临成熟旺季，需要商业部门赶快行动起来，大力收购，以支援工农业生产大跃进。
    我国野生油料的资源很丰富，只要在其生长繁殖期间，花费少许精力，注意保护和培植，在成熟季节花费一定劳动力进行采集，就可为国家增加很大财富。据初步调查，我国野生油料有四百余种，含油量一般都在15％以上，最高达60％。如苍耳子在加工技术先进地区每百斤可出油达十九斤六两，超过大豆的出油率。苍耳子油可以制油漆、油墨、机械润滑剂、柔化人造棉用的土耳其油，还可食用。山苍子又是高级香精原料，是极受欢迎的出口物资。
    全国野生油料的总产量，现在还没有摸清。据估计，占全国三分之二面积的山区、半山区的产量，约可达十六亿斤。武乡县1958年收购八十万斤，全县平均每人采集五斤十一两。如果能实现今年的收购指标，就相当于全县油料统购量的67％。仅采集收购和运输两项，就可以给农业社增加五万余元的收入。山西省今年计划收购三千万斤（各县跃进计划订三千九百万斤），除去直接出口的五百万斤外，其余二千五百万斤榨油，即占今年油脂上调任务的89.5％。如果号召全国五亿二千万农业人口每人采集三斤，则可以采集十五亿六千万斤，可为农业社增加七千八百万元的收入（每斤价五分计算）。把这些油料榨油，平均以15％最低出油率计算，能产油脂二亿三千四百万斤，除了全部代替1958年工业上所用的食用油，还可多余七千四百万斤，支援今年工业生产的跃进。
    这些油料还可以支援地方油脂工业生产，目前地方油脂工业因油料不足，现有设备能力只利用了70％左右。如山西大仁县今年收购八十万斤油料，可供全县经常闲置的二十二个油坊六个月的生产，因而全县油坊能达到常年加工。十五亿六千万斤油料能产油饼七亿八千万斤，能用以肥田增产大量粮食。由此可见，大力采集野生油料，对支援工、农业生产大跃进的巨大作用。反之，很大的财富将废弃于地。
    目前的主要问题是急需要各级商业部门，依靠党委领导，紧紧围绕党的中心工作，在有利于实现多快好省建设路线的前提下，向党委提出利用野生油料对工农业增产有利的计划，以及实现计划的有力措施等，做到及时向党委汇报情况与问题，便于党委加强对收购利用野生油料工作的领导。凡是这样做的地区，党委没有不欢迎的。如山西大仁县商业部门向党政汇报了收购利用苍耳子的实际效果，得到党委重视，县长在秋前三级扩干会上，亲自讲解收购野生油料的重要意义，并往下分配了收购任务，引起了农业社和基层社的重视。1957年他们结合生产救灾的中心工作，对野生油料进行了全面勘查，摸清全县资源和重点产区，在严重灾情下还收购了十二万斤野生油料，并为今年开展收购创造了条件。
    怎样解决采集野生油料的劳动力问题？依靠贯彻群众路线，大力开展宣传总路线，大力宣传利用野生油料对实现总路线的政治意义和经济意义，以及各种野生油料的样品、规格、价格等；宣传的形式可以多种多样，必须做到家喻户晓，深入人心，以引起群众的采集兴趣。动员老年人、妇女和儿童来参加采集，那末劳动力问题是可以获得解决的。如武乡县张家沟农业社，原计划今年八岁以上男女老少，平均每人采集十五斤，争取二十斤，后来经过各种劳动力代表的座谈会议，一致认为可以提高到平均每人采集五十斤，除辅助劳动力进行采集外，主要劳动力亦能在农忙间隙开展几天突击采集运动，对农业生产不会影响，因而使张家沟农业社的采集计划也增加了。这个县城关乡农业生产队长王改焕，去年她在收工回家路上捎带采集苍耳子一百八十余斤，卖了九元钱，添了一件新衣服，补助了零花钱，今年她计划全家四口人采集一千斤，还要组织全村七十名妇女，每人采集一百斤，并准备明年开块荒地，种植野生油料，研究变野生为家生。这些事实说明只要宣传工作做得比较深透，群众是乐意采集的。因此，商业部门要抓紧开展宣传工作，推广各种先进典型，树立先进旗帜，协助农业社安排劳动力，将采集野生油料列为副业生产之一，确定专人负责，及时与农业社签订收购合同，鼓励他们的采集积极性。
    除了组织农民采集外，组织社会力量采集亦很重要；现在有不少地区结合勤工俭学，商业部门与学校签订收购合同，动员学生采集，这种作法值得提倡。去年江苏省商业部门取得解放军的协助，在短短的时间内，突击采集了大量盐蒿子。今年我们应该把一切积极因素都动员起来，共同为完成采集任务，为国家增加油料财富而努力。同时还必须反对那种未认真做工作即大喊困难的保守思想。
    为了充分利用野生油料，商业部门要协助农业社、手工业部门大力进行试榨。例如武乡县商业局出资金、派干部帮助解决油坊加工困难，大力支持张家沟油坊试榨苍耳子，依靠乡支部领导，不断鼓励工人积极性，依靠工人大胆革新技术，终于使苍耳子从开初不出油，跃进到目前全国最高出油率。这个经验，对于一切野生油料都有普遍的意义。为了迎接旺季收购，要积极着手准备加工业务，力争赶上收购任务的需要。首先应充分发挥现有的加工力量，采取就地加工的方针，尽量组织农业社加工，这样既可发展农业社的多种经营，又能节省运费，饼肥还可及时归社使用。如果当地农业社无设备，工业部门又来不及，商业部门应本着因陋就简，结合技术革新，以小型为主，把加工业务积极地办起来。贯彻执行中央指出的大中小结合的原则，将有些在城市加工更为有利的品种，尽可能地供应城市加工。
    野生油料的成熟旺季即将来临，千方百计，把野生油料收购起来是个关键问题，商业部门应根据采集油料的不同对象，设置与之相适应的采购网，既便利群众出售，又可节省费用。仓库准备和保管技术的训练工作，亦需相应的有节奏地配合进行。
