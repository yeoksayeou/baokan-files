Instructions of the CCP Central Committee on Launching a Universal Socialist and Communist Education Movement in Rural Areas This Winter and Spring
August 29, 1958

(1) The successive waves of agricultural production upsurges in the past ten months, the great summer harvest, and the impending even greater autumn harvest have fully demonstrated that strengthening the Party's leadership and putting politics in command are the fundamental guarantees for doing all work well and completing all tasks. The political consciousness of the 500 million peasants, developed on the basis of the All-People Rectification and Anti-Rightist Struggle, the Rural Socialist Education Movement, and the General Line Propaganda and Education Movement, is becoming increasingly high. Individualism that is overly concerned with personal gains and losses, or localism that only cares about one's own team, commune, township, or county, has been greatly weakened; the commendable communist actions of urban-rural cooperation, industry-agriculture cooperation, selflessness, and mutual support have been greatly developed. This is the most precious spiritual force and material foundation in our socialist construction cause. In order to timely summarize experience, promote communist spirit, and ensure even greater comprehensive harvests in the summer and throughout the year of 1959; and in order to conduct a free-airing and contention debate on the issues of how to distribute the income of agricultural cooperatives and whether to establish people's communes, it is necessary to conduct a widespread socialist and communist education movement in rural areas this winter and spring.

(2) The content of this movement should be: summarizing and publicizing the achievements of the great agricultural harvest in the past year, specifically and vividly publicizing the great victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, publicizing the victory of correctly handling contradictions among the people, summarizing and publicizing the experience of farmland capital construction, water, fertilizer, soil, seed, close planting, and field management, and other agricultural production increase measures since last winter, summarizing the experience of communist large-scale cooperation in the past year, as well as the experience of strengthening organization and discipline in production and life, widely publicizing these successful experiences, and also publicizing the unprecedented great leap forward in industry, culture and education, and other socialist construction undertakings, publicizing plans for abundant food and clothing, and publicizing the bright and happy prospects of socialism and communism.

In this movement, it is necessary to fully promote the communist style of "uprooting white flags and planting red flags," and use countless examples of large-scale production increases to speak greatly and specially about the superiority of the socialist system, further strengthen the determination and confidence of the vast number of peasants to take the socialist road, thoroughly criticize the remaining capitalist spontaneous tendencies of some wealthy peasants, and continue to break down individualism and localism in people's minds, and greatly establish communism. Moreover, guide the masses to recall the historical lessons of the "saddle shape" of the past three years, thoroughly criticize the "condition theory" of "relying on heaven for food" and the "habit theory" of "following in the footsteps of predecessors," greatly break down right-leaning conservatism and the thinking of being content with being downstream, and greatly establish the thinking of going all out and striving for the upstream, so that the "tide-watching faction" and the "reckoning-after-the-autumn faction" are not only speechless in the face of the facts of the great harvest, but also ideologically bankrupt. All "white flags" and even "gray flags" should be completely uprooted, and red flags should be universally planted, so that the general line of socialist construction is more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

(3) How to reasonably distribute the income of agricultural cooperatives? How to transform agricultural cooperatives into people's communes? These are the two major issues of concern to everyone in the current rural areas. When conducting socialist and communist education in rural areas, all peasants should be mobilized to launch a free-airing and contention debate on these two issues, and guide the peasants to solve these two issues with the socialist and communist spirit.

This year's large-scale development of agricultural production and the large-scale increase in the income of agricultural cooperatives mean that the personal income of members should also generally increase slightly, but it should not increase too much, and the main thing is to increase the public accumulation of the cooperative. A portion of the public accumulation should be used to develop collective cultural and welfare undertakings, but first and foremost it should be used for the capital construction of agriculture and cooperative-run industries, expand reproduction, and accelerate socialist construction. In addition to being used to develop the production and welfare undertakings of the cooperative itself, a portion of the public accumulation of the cooperative should also be handed over to organs above the county level for overall planning and management of local and national production and welfare undertakings. It is necessary to promote the socialist and communist spirit and oppose bourgeois ideas such as individualism and localism through free-airing and contention debate.

The people's commune, which combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrates the township and the commune, is the best organizational form for building socialism at the present stage, and will also be the basic-level unit of the future communist society. It is necessary to enable the vast number of peasants to fully understand the greater superiority of the people's commune over the original agricultural cooperatives through free-airing and contention debate, consciously and voluntarily transform agricultural cooperatives into people's communes, and use the socialist and communist spirit to solve various economic problems related to the transformation into people's communes, and oppose individualism and localism.

(4) In the situation of widespread publicity of the great leap forward, great harvest, and great victory, with the masses in high spirits and high morale, combine the rectification work of party members and league members and the rectification of cooperatives, expand the scale of agricultural cooperatives and production teams, improve the level of operation and management, adhere to the system of cadres planting experimental fields, working with members, and participating in production to lead production, widely absorb members to participate in cooperative affairs management, especially field operation management, and further promote the traditional style of the mass line in cooperative management. Greatly commend the batches of socialist activists who are both red and expert who have emerged in the leap forward, select the outstanding figures among them to various leadership positions, form a strong backbone team for socialist construction, and absorb the advanced parts of them into the party to increase the party's fresh blood. As for individual places and a few townships and cooperatives where rectification and anti-rightism are not thorough, and the "five airs" have not been eliminated, they must be seriously rectified, and those who have repeatedly failed to reform and those who have serious right-leaning conservative ideas and are still in leadership positions must be resolutely replaced to ensure a comprehensive great leap forward. Doing so is more in line with the objective reality and more conducive to going all out, striving for the upstream, and giving full play to the positive role of the movement than rectifying the party and cooperatives in isolation.

(5) Throughout the movement, it should be carried out in accordance with the principle of correctly handling contradictions among the people, fully promote democracy, adopt forms such as free-airing, contention, great debate, big-character posters, on-site meetings, and exhibitions, and truly solve problems ideologically, so that this movement truly becomes a self-education movement for the broad masses. On the basis of the ideological liberation, the improvement of consciousness, and the greater enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants, and on the basis of the great harvest of 1958, formulate a plan for a greater leap forward in agricultural production in 1959, especially a plan for a greater summer harvest, as well as the implementation plans for water, fertilizer, soil, seed, close planting, tool improvement, and field management, and other production increase measures, and formulate a relatively long-term comprehensive long-term plan including "workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers," and "agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery." Through all this, set off a winter production upsurge greater than that since the winter of 1957, strive for a greater summer harvest in 1959, strive for a comprehensive leap forward in grain, cotton, and oil throughout 1959, and accelerate China's socialist construction.

    中共中央关于今冬明春在农村中普遍展开社会主义和共产主义教育运动的指示
    一九五八年八月二十九日
    （一）近十个月来农业生产高潮一浪高过一浪的形势，夏季大丰收和即将取得的秋季更大的丰收，已充分证明加强党的领导和政治挂帅，是作好一切工作，完成一切任务的基本保证。五亿农民在全民整风和反右派斗争，在农村社会主义教育运动，在总路线宣传教育运动等基础上所发展起来的政治觉悟愈来愈高。斤斤计较个人得失的个人主义或只顾本队、本社、本乡、本县的本位主义，已经大大削弱了；城乡协作，工农业协作，大公无私，互相支援的可歌可颂的共产主义行动，已经大大发展了。这是我国社会主义建设事业中最可珍贵的精神力量和物质基础。为着及时地总结经验，发扬共产主义精神，保证一九五九年夏季和全年全面的更大丰收；为着就农业社的收入如何分配问题和是否建立人民公社问题进行鸣放辩论，今冬明春在农村中进行一次广泛的社会主义和共产主义的教育运动，是必要的。
    （二）这个运动的内容应当是：总结和宣传一年来农业生产大丰收的成绩，具体生动地宣传党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，宣传正确处理人民内部矛盾的胜利，总结和宣传从去年冬季以来的农田基本建设、水、肥、土、种、密和田间管理等各项农业增产措施的经验，总结一年来共产主义大协作的经验，以及在生产和生活方面加强组织性和纪律性的经验，广泛宣传这些成功的经验，同时也要宣传工业、文教和其他各项社会主义建设事业的空前大跃进，宣传丰衣足食的规划，宣传社会主义和共产主义的光明幸福的前景。
    在这个运动中，要充分发扬“拔白旗、插红旗”的共产主义风格，以无数大增产的实例，来大讲特讲社会主义制度的优越性，更加坚定广大农民走社会主义道路的决心和信心，彻底批判一部分富裕农民残存的资本主义自发倾向，在人们的思想上继续破除个人主义、本位主义，大立共产主义。并且，引导群众回忆三年来“马鞍形”的历史教训，彻底批判“靠天吃饭”的“条件论”和“照着前人脚印走路”的“习惯论”，大破右倾保守、甘居下游的思想，大立鼓足干劲、力争上游的思想，使“观潮派”和“秋后算账派”不仅在大丰收的事实面前哑口无言，而且在思想上彻底破产。应该把一切“白旗”以至“灰旗”统统拔掉，把红旗普遍插起来，使社会主义建设总路线更加深入人心。
    （三）农业社的收入如何合理分配？如何由农业社转为人民公社？是当前农村中人人关心的两大问题。在农村中进行社会主义和共产主义教育的时候，应该发动所有的农民，就这两个问题展开鸣放辩论，并且引导农民用社会主义和共产主义精神来解决这两个问题。
    今年的农业生产大发展，农业社的收入大增加，社员的个人收入一般也应该略有增加，但是不宜增加过多，主要是增加社的公共积累。公共积累要有一部分用来发展集体的文化、福利事业，但是，首先应该用于农业和社办工业的基本建设，扩大再生产，加速建设社会主义。社的公共积累，除了用来发展本社的生产事业和福利事业以外，还应该有一部分交由县以上的机关统筹举办地方性的和全民性的生产事业和福利事业。应该通过鸣放辩论，发扬社会主义和共产主义的精神，反对个人主义、本位主义等资产阶级思想。
    工农商学兵合一，乡社合一的人民公社，是现阶段建设社会主义的最好的一种组织形式，也将是未来的共产主义社会的基层单位。应该通过鸣放辩论，使广大农民充分了解人民公社比原有的农业社具有更伟大的优越性，自觉自愿地把农业社转为人民公社，并且用社会主义和共产主义的精神，来解决与转为人民公社有关的各种经济问题，反对个人主义和本位主义。
    （四）在广泛宣传大跃进、大丰收、大胜利，群情兴奋，干劲冲天的局面中，结合进行党员团员的整风工作和整社工作，扩大农业社和生产队的规模，提高经营管理水平，坚持干部种试验田、同社员一起劳动、参加生产领导生产的制度，广泛吸收社员参加社务管理，特别是田间作业管理，在办社工作中更加发扬群众路线的传统作风。大大表扬跃进中涌现出来的成批的又红又专的社会主义积极分子，把其中的优秀人物选拔到各个领导岗位上来，组成一支坚强的社会主义建设的骨干队伍，并且吸收其中的先进部分到党内来，增加党的新鲜血液。至于个别地方，少数乡社，整风反右不彻底，“五气”还没有扫除，则必须认真整顿，对屡教不改和有严重右倾保守思想还居于领导地位的，必须坚决撤换，保证全面大跃进。这样做，比孤立地整风整社，更符合客观的实际情况，也更有利于鼓足干劲，力争上游，充分发挥运动的积极作用。
    （五）运动自始至终，都应该按照正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则，充分发扬民主，采取大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报、现场会、展览会等等形式，做到真正从思想上解决问题，使这个运动真正成为广大群众的自我教育运动。应该在广大农民群众的思想解放、觉悟提高、干劲更足的基础上，在一九五八年大丰收的基础上，制定出一九五九年农业生产更大跃进特别是夏季更大丰收的增产计划，以及水、肥、土、种、密、工具改良、田间管理等项增产措施的实施计划，制定出比较长期的包括“工、农、商、学、兵”，“农、林、牧、副、渔”的全面的远景规划。通过这一切，掀起一个比一九五七年冬季以来更大的冬季生产高潮，争取一九五九年夏季更大的丰收，争取一九五九年全年粮、棉、油全面跃进，加速我国的社会主义建设。
