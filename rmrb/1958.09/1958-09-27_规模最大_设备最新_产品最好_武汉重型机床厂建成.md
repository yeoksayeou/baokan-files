    Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant Completed
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 26th: China's largest heavy machine tool plant, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, has been fully completed and officially put into production ahead of schedule. The state acceptance committee inspected the plant's construction project and deemed the engineering quality to be excellent.
    At noon today, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant held a grand completion ceremony. Among those attending the conference were Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Zhang Nanxian, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Zhong Fuxiang, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building; Liu Jisun, Vice Governor of Hubei Province; and Shevakov, Director of the Enterprise Construction Bureau of the Soviet Foreign Economic Liaison Committee.
    This heavy machine tool plant, built with Soviet assistance and equipped with the latest equipment, can produce world-class heavy machine tools of various types. Construction began in April 1956 and was originally planned to be built in two phases, to be completed by the end of 1959. Full production was planned for early 1960, and the designed production capacity was expected to be reached in 1964. However, because the plant's Party committee consistently adhered to the policy of high-speed construction during the construction process and took effective measures to overcome various difficulties, the factory was basically completed a year and a half ahead of schedule by the end of June this year. At the same time, the plant also adopted the method of simultaneous construction and production. Before the plant was completed, it had already produced more than thirty heavy machine tools. Now, these machine tools have been put into production in electromechanical factories in Shanghai, Luoyang and other places.

    规模最大  设备最新  产品最好
    武汉重型机床厂建成
    新华社武汉26日电  我国目前规模最大的重型机床厂——武汉重型机床厂已经全部建成并提前正式投入生产。国家验收委员会验收了这个厂的建设工程，认为工程质量达到了优等。
    今天中午，武汉重型机床厂举行了隆重的庆祝竣工典礼大会，参加大会的有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒、委员张难先，第一机械工业部副部长钟夫翔，湖北省副省长刘济荪，苏联对外经济联络委员会企业建设局局长谢瓦柯夫等。
    这座由苏联帮助我国建设的、设备最新的重型机床厂，能够生产世界第一流的各种重型机床。它是1956年4月开工兴建的，原计划分两期建设，在1959年底建成。1960年初全面生产，1964年才能达到设计生产能力。但是，由于这个厂的党委在建厂过程中始终坚持了高速度建设的方针，并且采取有效措施排除了各种困难，终于使工厂提前一年半在今年6月底就基本建成了。同时，这个厂还采用了边建设边生产的方法，工厂在没有建成之前就生产了三十多台重型机床；现在，这些机床都已经在上海、洛阳等地的机电工厂投入生产了。
