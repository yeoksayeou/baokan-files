    One of the key projects in Hunan Province for the comprehensive utilization of shipping construction and water conservancy construction – the Shaoshui River improvement project – will be completed before National Day. The Shaoshui River is a tributary of the Zishui River, with a total length of 103 kilometers, most of which is within Shaodong County. This mountain stream, with fluctuating water levels and vastly different flows, could only accommodate small wooden boats of two to three tons. After the improvement project is completed, it can accommodate large wooden boats of twenty to thirty tons and small tugboats of forty-five horsepower, and the annual transport volume can be increased eighteen times.

    邵水将通大木船
    湖南省航运建设和水利建设综合利用的重点工程之一——邵水整治工程，将在国庆节前完工。邵水是资水的支流，全长一百零三公里，大部分在邵东县境内。这条山涧小河，水位时涨时落，流量相差悬殊，只能通航二吨至三吨的小木船。整治工程完成后，可以通航二十吨至三十吨的大木船和四十五马力的小拖轮，年运量可以增加十八倍。
