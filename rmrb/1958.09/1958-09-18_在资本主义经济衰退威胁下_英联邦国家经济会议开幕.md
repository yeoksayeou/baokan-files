Xinhua News Agency, Montreal, September 16th: The Commonwealth Economic Conference opened on the 15th in Montreal, Canada. Representatives from eleven Commonwealth countries, accounting for nearly 25% of world trade, are participating in the conference.

This conference is being held at a time when many capitalist countries are reducing their demand on the world market due to economic recession, and when the contradictions between major capitalist countries—raw material exporters and industrial goods and basic equipment exporters—are becoming increasingly acute.

The protectionist tariff policies pursued by the United States, which restrict the entry of raw materials and commodities from Commonwealth countries into the U.S. market, and its practices of dumping so-called "surplus" agricultural products on the world market, raising prices of industrial goods, and lowering prices of raw materials, etc., have left most Commonwealth countries in a state of chronic gold and dollar shortages.

Based on this central problem, some at the first day of the conference demanded providing loans to less developed countries and increasing investment necessary for the economic development of these countries. However, the main capital exporters of the Commonwealth, Britain and Canada, do not have surplus funds to provide these loans. Political commentators point out that Commonwealth countries will have to seek assistance from the United States. Judging from the statements of U.S. national leaders, the U.S. is prepared to strengthen the role of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which are under its control, and increase the funds of these institutions. This is actually to strengthen the economic dependence of the Sterling Area countries on these two institutions and to intensify the penetration of American capital into Commonwealth countries.

There are also serious differences between Commonwealth countries. According to newspaper reports, Canada is prepared to insist that Britain abolish import restrictions on Canadian goods. On the other hand, Australia and New Zealand insist that Canada abolish the import controls that were implemented in 1951. This control has effectively closed the door for New Zealand, which is completely dependent on dairy exports, to import butter and cheese into the Canadian market. For the reasons mentioned above, Canadian newspapers express doubt about the possible results of this conference.

    在资本主义经济衰退威胁下
    英联邦国家经济会议开幕
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社蒙特利尔16日讯：英联邦国家经济会议15日在加拿大的蒙特利尔开幕。参加会议的有占世界贸易额将近25％的十一个英联邦国家的代表。
    这次会议是在许多资本主义国家由于经济衰退而减少了对世界市场的需求，以及主要资本主义国家——原料出口国和工业品及基本装备出口国——之间的矛盾日益尖锐的时候召开的。
    美国所奉行的限制英联邦国家的原料和商品进入美国市场的保护关税政策以及它采取的在世界市场上倾销所谓“剩余”农产品、提高工业品价格和降低原料价格等等做法，使得大多数英联邦国家经常处于黄金和美元荒状态。
    根据这一中心问题，在第一天会议上就有人要求向不大发达的国家提供贷款和增加为这些国家的经济发展所必需的投资。然而英联邦的主要资本输出国英国和加拿大没有剩余资金来提供这些贷款。据政治评论员指出，英联邦国家将不得不向美国求援。从美国国家领导人的谈话看来，美国准备加强受它控制的国际货币基金组织和国际复兴开发银行的作用，并且增加这些机构的资金。这实际上就是加强英镑区国家对这两个机构的经济依赖和使美国资本加紧渗入英联邦国家。
    英联邦国家之间也有着严重的分歧。从报纸的报道看来，加拿大准备坚持要求英国取消对加拿大商品的入口限制。另一方面，澳大利亚和新西兰则坚持要求加拿大取消在1951年开始实行的进口管制。这种管制实际上是关闭了完全依赖出口乳制品的新西兰把黄油和乳酪输入加拿大市场的大门。根据上述原因，加拿大报纸对于这次会议可能取得的结果，表示怀疑。
