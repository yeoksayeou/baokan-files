The Mongolian people and government fully support the measures taken by the Chinese people to liberate their inalienable territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands.

Sambuu said that the just struggle waged by the great Chinese people against imperialism has received the warm support of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, as well as peace-loving countries and people around the world. Sambuu said, "The friendly cooperation between Mongolia and China is increasingly strengthened and consolidated. The selfless assistance given to us by China has made a great contribution to our socialist construction."

Ambassador Xie Fusheng, in his congratulatory speech, congratulated the Mongolian people on the great achievements they have made in all aspects of socialist construction. He said that the Mongolian government has consistently pursued a foreign policy of safeguarding world peace and supporting the liberation struggles of oppressed nations, which has further expanded and enhanced Mongolia's international influence and international status. The Chinese people express their heartfelt admiration for this.

In his congratulatory speech, he wished for the further development and consolidation of the friendly relations between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples.
