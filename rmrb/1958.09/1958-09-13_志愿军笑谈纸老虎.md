    Volunteers Laugh About Paper Tigers
    Han Zi
    Every time I hear that the American invading troops are invading other countries' territories somewhere, in my extreme anger, I can't help but think for them: how can they so easily forget the role of paper tigers they played on the Korean battlefield! I believe that no Chinese People's Volunteer Army is afraid of this paper tiger. One of the most beautiful feelings we cultivated at the front was the immense sense of pride in the face of the American invading army, which is also the spirit of all the Chinese people. In 1952, on the front lines in Korea, I was very interested in recording the embarrassing 모습을 of the American paper tiger. The stories were casually told to me by the soldiers around me, and sometimes they took me to see them. Now I need to send a memorandum to those guys who dare to act recklessly on our sacred territory.

    Once, after I had recorded in detail how several soldiers hit the enemy with sniper fire, I also had a comprehensive description of the enemy's life posture at the front line positions: "After fighting for a while, we have gains every day, and the enemy has also become cunning. If there is nothing important, he won't come out of the shelter. He puts his urine and stool in tin cans and throws them out. Every time he goes out, he makes a fool of himself, either running away, jumping and hopping, or simply crawling like a dog, shaking his body and head. He just doesn't walk like a human being. If you are cunning, I have tactics. We can always make the bullets meet him. If he doesn't come out, we will use 'infantry-artillery coordination' and use artillery shells to knock on his shelters and tents to chase him out. If he runs, aim at the three steps in front of him. If he plays tricks, aim the muzzle at him. Look carefully before firing, so that Sun Wukong can't jump out of the Tathagata Buddha's palm...." I still remember that an American soldier with too little experience dared to stand in front of their position with his hands in his pockets. Sorry, Little Yang, who was new to our side, didn't like it and shot him down with two shots.

    During the Battle of Shangganling, Comrade Liu Guomin, our squad leader who held the tunnels, described some of the "attacking" enemies even better than I did: "Look, look, I've figured out a pattern these days: the American devils don't have any formation when they come up, and they don't have any formation when they go down. They are as crowded as sheep, just looking for a beating. One time it was even stranger, because the mountain was steep and the American devils were stupid, they couldn't climb up. The ones in front were afraid and tired, and kept looking back. The ones behind were lifting the necks and holding the butts of the ones in front. Don't you think this is a fixed target for snipers?" What about the air force? There are also stories. At that time, we shot down a pilot from their highest and most solid artillery spotting plane. We laughed and asked him why their shells always hit places where the Volunteer Army wasn't. He was honest and said that he really flew too high and couldn't see the target clearly! He also said that his superiors stipulated that he should perform his mission at 3,500 meters above the ground, and they only dared to descend to 5,000 meters at most. Even so, they could only delay for a few seconds, and one more second would be more dangerous. We asked him why he couldn't follow his superiors' orders? He shrugged and answered even more frankly: "Our superiors also carry out their missions like this!" What about their artillery? Do you still remember how they asked us in the opinion box in Panmunjom? They said, "Your artillery fire is too ruthless...." Can we be merciful to the invaders? I personally saw our artillery battalion destroy eleven of their cannons within three days, and the ammunition depot that was hit shot out flames more than one hundred meters high.

    I know too little, and the Volunteer Army should all speak up. No, it's best to let those American soldiers who survived the Korean battlefield recall it carefully.

    Now, I want to shout loudly at the American troops in the Taiwan Strait area: Get out, get out! Withdraw from the sacred and inviolable Chinese territory and territorial waters! The Chinese people's sense of pride will never allow you to be fierce! [Supplied by Tianjin People's Fine Arts Publishing House]

    志愿军笑谈纸老虎
    菡子
    每次当我听说美国的侵略军队又在什么地方侵犯别国的领土时，我在万分的愤怒之中，还不免替他们想到：怎么就这么容易忘记他们在朝鲜战场原是扮演的纸老虎的脚色！我相信任何一个中国人民志愿军都不怕这只纸老虎。我们在前方培养的最美好的感情之一，就是在美国侵略军面前无比的自豪感，这也正是全体中国人民的气概。1952年在朝鲜前线，我对记载美国纸老虎的狼狈相有过很大的兴趣，都是身边的战士随便告诉我的，有时他们也带着我去瞧。现在我需要给那些胆敢在我们神圣的领土上蠢动的家伙们送一份备忘录。
    有一次我在详尽地记下了几个战士怎么以冷枪冷炮击中敌人的情况以后，对敌人在前沿阵地的生活姿态还有过一段综合性的描写：“打了不久，咱们每天都有战果，敌人可也打狡猾了，他没个要紧的事，高低不出掩蔽部，大小便都装在罐头盒里往外摔。一出门尽出洋相，不是一溜跑步，就是一蹦一踪，或者干脆学狗爬，晃着身子、摇着脑袋，就没个走路样子。你猾，我有战术，咱们终能叫子弹跟他碰头。他不出来，咱们来个‘步炮协同’，先使炮弹敲他的掩蔽部和帐篷，撵他往外跑；他跑步，就瞄他前三步；他耍把戏，枪口就盯着他瞄，看稳了才顶火，高低不叫孙猴子跳出如来佛的手心。……”现在我还记得有个阅历太浅的美国兵胆敢把手插在裤袋里在他们阵地面前站了起来，对不起，我们这边初出茅芦的小杨看不顺眼，两枪把他打倒了。
    上甘岭战斗的时候，我们坚守坑道的班长刘国民同志，对一些“进攻”的敌人，比我还描写得好：“看着，看着，这几天摸到一个规律：美国鬼子，上来没有队形，下去更没有队形了。来去都挤得跟羊群一样，就是个挨揍的样子。有一次更奇怪，因为山陡，美国鬼子又笨，爬不上来，走前面的更是又怕又累，尽向后看，后面的就给前面的提着脖子托着屁股。你看这是不是一群挨冷枪的固定目标？”空军怎么样？也有故事。那时正从他们飞得最高也最坚固的炮火校正机上打下一个驾驶员，我们笑着问他怎么他们的炮弹尽打在志愿军不在的地方。他倒坦白，说实在飞得太高，哪里看得清目标？！还说上司规定他离地面三千五百公尺时执行任务，他们顶多只敢降至五千公尺，就那么样也只能耽搁几秒钟，多一秒钟危险性就大。我们追问他怎么可以不执行上司的规定？他耸耸肩更加坦率地回答：“我们的上司也是这样执行任务的嘛！”他们的炮兵呢？可还记得怎么在板门店的意见箱里求我们来着？他们说：“你们的炮火太无情了。……”难道对侵略者还能有情么？我亲眼看见我们一个炮营三天之内打毁了他们十一门大炮，被击中的弹药库冲出一百多公尺高的火苗。
    我知道的实在太少，应该让志愿军都来说说。不，最好让那些在朝鲜战场侥幸生还的美国兵都好好地回忆一下。
    现在，我要对于在台湾海峡地区的美军大喝一声：滚滚，滚！退出神圣不可侵犯的中国领土领海！中国人民的自豪感，决不允许你们逞凶！〔天津人民美术出版社供稿〕
