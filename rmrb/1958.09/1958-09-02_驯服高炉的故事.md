　　The Story of Taming a Blast Furnace
　　By our reporter Zhang Guanwu
    The newly built small blast furnace at the Daye County Iron Smelting Plant was like an unruly steed, refusing to obey orders. Technicians from the Daye Steel Plant conducted experiments for two consecutive days, but were unable to make it produce molten iron. At this time, Xiao Qixiang, the Party Branch Secretary, and worker Zhou Shouchun, who had just returned from studying at the Yangcheng Yingchao Iron Industry Cooperative in Shanxi, were determined to subdue this blast furnace and make it produce iron normally.
    "Technicians from the Daye Steel Plant came and couldn't smelt iron. Can these 'three-and-a-half-day engineers' smelt iron?" some people said with disbelief.
    However, these two "three-and-a-half-day engineers," who were doubted by people, quickly tamed this "unruly steed," causing molten iron to flow and making it a red banner for blast furnaces in Daye County. On the day of the successful experiment, this small 2.3 cubic meter semi-native, semi-foreign blast furnace produced one ton of molten iron in less than a day.
    Frankly, at first, I didn't quite believe that two people who had never seen a blast furnace or knew anything about iron smelting could master the complex iron smelting technology in just over three days. But after hearing Xiao Qixiang eloquently introduce iron smelting technology to the people, how the small blast furnace should be built, how to observe the fire during iron smelting... He could explain everything to you in detail, from the construction of the small blast furnace to every环节 of the iron smelting process, making you believe that he was indeed an iron smelting expert.
    "Why did you master the iron smelting technology of the small blast furnace so quickly?" I couldn't help but ask when I visited Xiao Qixiang.
    His answer was very simple: "As long as you listen to the Party, put politics in command, dare to think, dare to act, and study diligently, and don't lose heart when you fail, then you will quickly learn iron smelting technology."
    Indeed, that was the case, there were no other secrets.
    Xiao Qixiang was originally the Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau of the Daye County People's Committee, a cadre of peasant origin who had only attended private school for two and a half years intermittently. Zhou Shouchun was a foundry worker at the Daye County Farm Implement Factory and had also never smelted iron. At the beginning of June this year, Xiao Qixiang returned from laboring at the Dongxihu Farm in Wuhan, and the County Party Committee asked him to set up an iron smelting plant and be responsible for the iron smelting work. He had not only never smelted iron, but he also had no impression of what a blast furnace looked like. He felt honored to take on this new job, but at the same time, he was afraid that he could not handle it. He was afraid that he would spend money and not be able to smelt iron, causing the loss of state materials. At this time, the Party and government leaders encouraged him, saying: No one is born knowing how to smelt iron. There is always a process from not knowing to knowing in anything, and failure itself is also a process. As long as you have enough energy, you will eventually succeed. So, Xiao Qixiang boldly took on the task of iron smelting. Due to a lack of technical experience, the first iron smelting attempt failed.
    Xiao Qixiang was not discouraged at all. He thought, "There is nothing in the world that cannot be learned. If we try a few more times, we will always succeed." Then, he and Zhou Shouchun ran to the Yangcheng Yingchao Iron Industry Cooperative in Shanxi, determined to fight hard for three days and nights to become technicians.
    As soon as they arrived there, they participated in the furnace repair work. When the furnace was repaired and put into production, they participated in the production at the furnace side, from charging the furnace to tapping the iron, continuously for 24 hours at the furnace side, until the entire production process ended.
    They studied hard day and night like this, not letting go of any opportunity to learn. They measured everything they saw and collected every bit of experience at any time and place. In five days (the actual production operation was only over three days), they mastered all aspects of the small blast furnace's construction, repair, and production process. Their notebooks were filled with notes. They successfully completed the learning task.
    As soon as Xiao Qixiang returned, he was able to correctly guide production and find the cause of the furnace's inability to produce iron. He and Zhou Shouchun participated in the first iron smelting experiment of the small blast furnace. At that time, the furnace bottom solidified and the molten iron could not flow out. The technicians from the Daye Steel Plant, who were responsible for the specific guidance of the iron smelting work, did not know how to solve the problem of the solidified bottom of the small blast furnace.
    Xiao Qixiang and the workers held a "Zhuge Liang meeting" to study the reasons for the failure of this iron smelting experiment. From a careful examination of the bottom solidification phenomenon, he and Zhou Shouchun believed that there were three reasons for this bottom solidification: (1) The air inlet pipe was bent, and the air flow in the furnace was reduced; (2) The air was blown in as soon as the fire was lit, and the blowing time was too early, causing the firewood at the bottom to burn quickly, while the coke above did not burn well and fell off, resulting in a low temperature at the bottom of the furnace. It was necessary to stop for a few hours after lighting the fire to allow the coke to burn to a certain extent in the upper part before blowing air, in order to maintain the bottom temperature of the furnace; (3) There was obvious water vapor flowing in the air duct, indicating that the furnace had not yet been dried. The workers agreed with this analysis.
    This scientific analysis further increased their confidence, and in the third experiment, molten iron flowed out continuously.

　　驯服高炉的故事
　　本报记者　张冠五
    大冶县炼铁厂新建的小高炉像一匹不易驯服的烈马，怎么也不听使唤。大冶钢厂的技术人员连续进行了两天试验，都没有使它流出铁水来。这时，刚从山西阳城应朝铁业社学习回来的党支部书记萧其祥和工人周寿臣却决心要降服这座高炉，使它正常出铁生产。
    “大冶钢厂的技术员来了，都没有炼出铁来，‘三天半的工程师’能炼出铁来吗？”有人抱着不相信的态度，这样说。
    但是，这两位被人们怀疑的“三天半的工程师”却很快地驯服了这匹“烈马”，使它铁水奔流，成为大冶县高炉的一面红旗。在试验成功的那天，不到一天工夫，这座二点三立方公尺的半土半洋的小高炉，就流出了一吨铁水。
    真的，开始我也不大相信两个从来没有见过高炉、又不知炼铁为何事的人，只有三天多时间就能掌握复杂的炼铁技术。但是听到萧其祥滔滔不绝的向人们介绍炼铁技术，小高炉应该怎样建啦，炼铁怎样看火啦……他能从小高炉的建设一直到炼铁过程的每一环节，都详细地讲给你听，使你不得不相信，他俨然已是一个炼铁行家了。
    “你们为什么这样快就掌握了小高炉的炼铁技术？”我在访问萧其祥时，不禁这样问。
    他回答的很简单：“只要听党的话，政治挂了帅，敢想、敢做、刻苦钻研，失败了不灰心，那末，炼铁技术就很快学会了。”
    情况也确是如此，没有其他秘密。
    萧其祥原来是大冶县人民委员会财政局副局长，是个只断断续续地念了两年半私塾的农民出身的干部。周寿臣是大冶县农具厂的翻砂工人，也没有炼过铁。今年6月初，萧其祥从武汉东西湖农场劳动回来，县委就要他办炼铁厂，负责炼铁工作。他不仅没有炼过铁，就连高炉是个什么模样，脑海中也毫无印象。担任这项新的工作，他感觉很光荣，同时又怕担当不了。他怕花了钱，炼不出铁来使国家物资受到损失。这时，党政领导鼓励说：谁也不是生下来就会炼铁，任何一件事，从不会到会总是有个过程的，而失败本身也就是过程，只要鼓足了干劲，最后终会获得成功的。于是，萧其祥就大胆地担当起炼铁任务，由于技术经验不足，第一次炼铁就失败了。
    萧其祥一点也没有灰心，他想：“天下没有学不会的事，多试验几次总会成功的。”接着，他同周寿臣一起跑到山西应朝铁业社，决心苦战三昼夜，变成技术员。
    他们一到那里就参加修炉子工作，炉子修好生产了，他们参加炉边生产，从装炉到出铁，连续在炉边二十四小时，一直到整个生产过程终结。
    他们就是这样日日夜夜顽强的学习，不放松一点学习的时机，看到什么都要丈量，随时随地把点滴经验汇集起来。在五天的时间内（实际生产操作只有三天多时间），就掌握了从小高炉的建设、修理、生产过程的各个环节，笔记簿上写满了一大本。圆满地完成了学习任务。
    萧其祥一回来，就能够正确地指导生产，找出炉子不能出铁的毛病。小高炉第一次炼铁试验，他和周寿臣都参加了，当时炉子结了底，铁水流不出来，负责具体指导炼铁工作的大冶钢厂的技术员不知怎样解决小高炉结底问题。
    萧其祥就和工人一起开“诸葛亮会”，对这次炼铁试验失败的原因进行研究。他和周寿臣从对结底现象的仔细考察中，认为造成这次结底的原因有三：（1）进风管弯曲，炉内风力小了；（2）一开始点火就鼓风，鼓风的时间过早，造成下部的柴火燃烧的快，而上面的焦炭没有很好燃烧就脱落下来，造成炉下温度低，应该点火后停几个小时，让焦炭在上部进行一定燃烧后再鼓风，以保持炉底温度。（3）风道有明显的水汽淌动，说明炉子还没有烤干。工人们都同意这一分析。
    这一科学的分析，更加增加了他们的信心，第三次试验时，铁水就源源地流出来了。
