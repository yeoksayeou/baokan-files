    U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered a radio address on September 11. In this speech, the U.S. president, with all the slander at his command, cursed the great People's China as a "powerful dictatorship," a "cruel tyrant," "belligerent and aggressive," a "major aggressor"... He probably used almost all such most vicious words that he could find in the American dictionary. These curses would be most appropriate when applied to U.S. imperialism itself. We, the Chinese people, have long been accustomed to this kind of curses from reactionaries at home and abroad. Curses cannot submerge the truth, nor can they stop the advance of the wheels of history. Our People's Republic of China has grown and strengthened in such curses. If such curses have any meaning, it only proves that we, the Chinese people, are doing the right thing, doing it well, and that the enemies who originally hoped that we would succumb or "disappear" are greatly disappointed and enraged. Eisenhower is not unaware that no roar, whether from the White House or the Pentagon, or the roar of American cannons used by the Kuomintang army on the mainland nine years ago or fired by the American army itself on the Korean front five years ago, can intimidate the great Chinese people. The White House owner's tantrum this time, according to American newspapers, was intended to quell strong domestic dissatisfaction with the military adventurous policy adopted by the U.S. authorities in the Taiwan Strait area, and also to "persuade" those American "friends and allies" who are afraid of being dragged onto the American chariot and are trying to express their attitude of "non-involvement, keeping aloof" toward the situation in the Taiwan area. It seems that the U.S. authorities are in an extremely isolated position because of their implementation of an extremely dangerous policy of aggression in the Taiwan Strait area, and this is probably the background for Eisenhower's radio address.
    As everyone knows, it is entirely China's internal affair for the Chinese people to liberate their own territory of Taiwan and coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu. However, the U.S. authorities have occupied China's territory of Taiwan with armed forces and are conducting military provocations and war threats against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area, which is clearly a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and an obvious act of aggression. Ten days ago, Eisenhower authorized Dulles to issue a statement, attempting to conceal the aggressive nature of the U.S. actions and to describe the just actions of the Chinese people to liberate their own territory as "undermining the principles that form the basis of world order" and "endangering the vital positions of the free world and the security of the United States." These lies of Dulles could not "persuade" even some sober-minded people in the U.S. ruling group, let alone the broad masses of the American public. An American financier, James Warburg, said in his telegram to Eisenhower that the U.S. military action to keep the coastal islands under Chiang Kai-shek's control "is in effect interfering in China's civil war." Democratic Senator Morse also said, "Regarding Jinmen and Mazu, according to international law, the United States has no right to defend the Chinese Nationalists on these islands. If we go to defend them, we will be denounced as aggressors, and that is indeed the case." Dulles failed to "persuade" the Americans and could only "persuade" Eisenhower to personally come out to give the Americans another "re-persuasion." However, Eisenhower was unable to add anything other than repeating Dulles's clich√©s.
    The U.S. authorities' military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area have created an extremely serious danger of war. Any American with a little sense knows that the war that the people in the White House and the Pentagon want to provoke is an unjust war, a war with no hope of victory. A letter from a reader named Thomas published in the Baltimore Sun said: Dulles's threat to drag us into war for Jinmen Island, to send our sons to die for Chiang Kai-shek, is not in the interests of our people. An editorial in the Detroit Free Press said, "We seriously doubt whether one in a million Americans is willing to fight for Taiwan." "If we enter a world war simply to protect Chiang Kai-shek, who lives in Taiwan on our dollars, it is simply terrible." Indeed, what could be a more terrible disaster for the United States than a direct armed conflict with People's China? Nine years ago, didn't the United States spend four or five billion U.S. dollars to arm four or five million Kuomintang troops and drive them to launch a large-scale offensive against the Chinese People's Liberation Army? Five years ago, didn't the United States personally take action, mobilizing more than one million modern armed forces to compete with the people of China and Korea? The result is known to the world. The vast majority of the Kuomintang army was annihilated, and the remaining troops, together with the forces of U.S. imperialism, were driven out of mainland China. On the Korean battlefield, the U.S. aggressors, under the joint counterattack of the Chinese and Korean people's armies, were defeated and retreated to the vicinity of the original 38th parallel where they launched the aggression, and finally had to accept the armistice. Now, if the U.S. aggressors dare to launch a war against China, then, as former U.S. Secretary of the Army Hurley said, it would be tantamount to suicide. Former Secretary of State Acheson also pointed out, "In this war, we (referring to the United States) have neither friends nor allies."
    What is deplorable about U.S. imperialism is not only that its military adventurous policy is unpopular at home, but also that this policy does not receive the support of its "friends and allies." Eisenhower has probably seen that the situation is not good, so he shouted hoarsely in his speech: The Chinese people's liberation of their own territory is a "clear danger to the free world"; saying that "if Taiwan falls into the hands of the enemy, the Republic of the Philippines will be the next object of conquest"; saying that China's "ambitious plans" are "to eliminate all the positions of the free world in the Western Pacific"... Oh dear, it's really terrible, the Chinese have great "sins" and great "ambitions"! But this is a huge lie. It seems that Eisenhower is intimidating the American people, especially the friends and allies of the United States. He is playing the domino game, he is telling the American "friends and allies" to watch, the first domino falls, and the rest of the dominoes will follow. The Americans also said this four years ago when the Dien Bien Phu battle was going on, but the French (and the British) were not intimidated at the time, and still agreed to the Indochina armistice regardless of the opposition of the United States. Now, who believes in this kind of game? Many "friends and allies" of the United States really do not understand why the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory is a threat to other countries, is a threat to peace, and the United States sending its armed forces to the doorstep of China to interfere in China's internal affairs and carry out military provocations is instead "committed to glorious peace"? The Canadian Financial Times put it well: "Now the Chinese Communists are taking steps to eliminate the threat to their own door, and calling this aggression is utter nonsense." This newspaper also said, "Neither heaven nor mankind has appointed the United States the task of ruling all the rest of the world." The heads of government of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have expressed their unwillingness to be involved in the situation in Taiwan, and a spokesman for the British government has publicly stated that Britain "has not undertaken any obligations to the United States regarding the situation in the Far East." Thai Prime Minister Nai Thanom Kittikachorn believes that the situation in the Taiwan Strait is "very alarming," "but this is the Chinese people's own business." Even Philippine President Garcia has stated that the Philippines "does not have a treaty obligation to fight alongside the U.S. military." In Japan, government officials are very worried that the United States will drag Japan into a war against China.
    Eisenhower made himself out to be very pitiful, as if someone wanted to "trick or intimidate" him, as if someone wanted him to "succumb." We Chinese can declare that we do not want to "trick or intimidate" anyone, nor do we want anyone to "succumb." We do not want an inch of other countries' land, nor will we allow other countries to occupy an inch of our land. Eisenhower talked a lot about not "appeasing" in his speech, as if not interfering in China's internal affairs is "appeasement," and the United States carrying out armed intervention is called not "appeasing," which is really absurd. We Chinese people absolutely do not need anyone to appease us, on the contrary, we will never appease the aggressors. We will never appease the U.S. aggressors who have occupied our territory Taiwan and are carrying out military provocations in our coastal areas. In fact, since the end of World War II, the era of appeasing aggressors has gone forever. The people who fought for the independence and freedom of their motherland resolutely gave the aggressors a powerful blow. The Koreans and the Chinese did not appease the U.S. aggressors, we repelled their aggression and forced them to accept the armistice; the Vietnamese did not appease the French aggressors, resolutely resisted, and also forced them to accept the armistice; the Egyptians did not appease the British and French aggressors, and also resolutely resisted, finally forcing the invading armies to withdraw; the Syrians and other Arabs and the peace-loving people of the world did not appease U.S. imperialism, and waged a resolute struggle against the U.S. subversive conspiracies and war threats, finally crushing the U.S. conspiracies and threats; the Arabs and the peace-loving people of the world did not appease the U.S. and British imperialism's occupation of Lebanon and Jordan, unanimously stood up and resolutely struggled, forcing them to agree to the resolution passed by the UN General Assembly to withdraw their troops, although they are still trying to delay the withdrawal of troops. It is precisely because of this series of resolute struggles without appeasement that the ferocity of the aggressors has been curbed. If the Washington authorities still harbor any illusions that others will condone U.S. aggression, they should abandon them as soon as possible.
    Eisenhower also repeatedly mentioned "Munich" in his speech. Indeed, the people of the world remember "Munich," and know even better than Eisenhower what the essence of the "appeasement policy" of "Munich" is. That is the joint intervention of imperialist countries, forcing weak countries to give up their sovereignty. Eisenhower is unwilling or dare not to explicitly state this point, which precisely reflects his position as an aggressor. The Chinese people not only remember "Munich," but also remember the "Lansing-Ishii Agreement" of 1918, which was the beginning of the collusion between the U.S. and Japan to invade China, and paved the way for Japan's occupation of the three northeastern provinces of China. We also remember the "Far East Munich" conspiracy between Japan, the U.S., and Britain between 1937 and 1941, which was designed to sacrifice China and create an anti-communist, anti-Soviet situation. It was only because the people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party insisted on resisting the war and opposed Chiang Kai-shek's selling out of sovereignty that these conspiracies failed to materialize. The China of today is no longer the China of more than ten years ago, let alone the China of forty years ago. The China of today is no longer a weak country that can be manipulated and slaughtered by others, but a new and powerful country where 600 million people have mastered their own destiny. The days when imperialists united to intervene in China and force China to give up its sovereignty are gone forever.
    Not only is this the case in China, but throughout the world after World War II, the "Munich" era has also been declared dead. Just look at the Korean War, the Indochina War, the Suez Canal incident, and the recent revolution in Iraq and the crisis in the Middle East, which of these events did the imperialist forces headed by the United States not try to intervene in, or even directly carry out aggression? However, they did not succeed in any of them. Their plans of aggression have failed one after another, and the imperialist aggressors have been beaten bloody. Now is the era when the formerly oppressed and enslaved people of all countries have awakened and actively engaged in the struggle for freedom and independence, it is the era when the people of these countries handle their own affairs, it is the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind. Any intervention and aggression by imperialist forces will absolutely no longer be tolerated or appeased by the people. Taiwan is China's territory, and U.S. aggressors are absolutely not allowed to permanently occupy it through any conspiracy. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan at the appropriate time and in the appropriate way. Jinmen and Mazu are inland islands of China, and U.S. imperialism is absolutely not allowed to expand its scope of aggression here. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate the Chiang Kai-shek troops continuing to occupy Jinmen and Mazu, harassing and sabotaging our coastal areas. What the Chinese people are currently taking in the Taiwan Strait situation is precisely this attitude of never appeasing and never tolerating the aggression and interference of U.S. imperialism. This is the valuable experience we have gained at the cost of blood, and it is also the firm will of the great Chinese people that can never be shaken.
    Eisenhower expressed his hope in his speech to resolve the international disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan Strait area through the "path of negotiation." If this is not to deceive world public opinion, it is certainly not a bad thing. The Chinese government has stated that in order to make another effort to maintain peace, China is ready to resume ambassadorial talks between the two countries. However, just as the talks are about to begin, U.S. warships and aircraft, disregarding the warnings of the Chinese government, have repeatedly invaded China's territorial waters and airspace, filling the Taiwan Strait situation with serious danger. If the United States does not stop this dangerous provocation, it will cause serious consequences. Eisenhower said time and again that he "believes there will be no war," but if he is unwilling to stop this military provocation, then simply playing with lies and sophistry, in Eisenhower's own words, will absolutely "not deceive or control world public opinion." How sincere the United States is about taking the "path of negotiation" will soon be tested. The Chinese people will judge whether Eisenhower's "ardent hope" for peace is true or false based on the actions of the United States.
