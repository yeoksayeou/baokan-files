    U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered a radio address on September 11. In this speech, the U.S. president, with all the slander at his command, cursed the great People's China as a "powerful dictatorship," a "cruel tyrant," "belligerent and aggressive," a "major aggressor"... He probably used almost all such most vicious words that he could find in the American dictionary. These curses would be most appropriate when applied to U.S. imperialism itself. We, the Chinese people, have long been accustomed to this kind of curses from reactionaries at home and abroad. Curses cannot submerge the truth, nor can they stop the advance of the wheels of history. Our People's Republic of China has grown and strengthened in such curses. If such curses have any meaning, it only proves that we, the Chinese people, are doing the right thing, doing it well, and that the enemies who originally hoped that we would succumb or "disappear" are greatly disappointed and enraged. Eisenhower is not unaware that no roar, whether from the White House or the Pentagon, or the roar of American cannons used by the Kuomintang army on the mainland nine years ago or fired by the American army itself on the Korean front five years ago, can intimidate the great Chinese people. The White House owner's tantrum this time, according to American newspapers, was intended to quell strong domestic dissatisfaction with the military adventurous policy adopted by the U.S. authorities in the Taiwan Strait area, and also to "persuade" those American "friends and allies" who are afraid of being dragged onto the American chariot and are trying to express their attitude of "non-involvement, keeping aloof" toward the situation in the Taiwan area. It seems that the U.S. authorities are in an extremely isolated position because of their implementation of an extremely dangerous policy of aggression in the Taiwan Strait area, and this is probably the background for Eisenhower's radio address.
    As everyone knows, it is entirely China's internal affair for the Chinese people to liberate their own territory of Taiwan and coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu. However, the U.S. authorities have occupied China's territory of Taiwan with armed forces and are conducting military provocations and war threats against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area, which is clearly a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and an obvious act of aggression. Ten days ago, Eisenhower authorized Dulles to issue a statement, attempting to conceal the aggressive nature of the U.S. actions and to describe the just actions of the Chinese people to liberate their own territory as "undermining the principles that form the basis of world order" and "endangering the vital positions of the free world and the security of the United States." These lies of Dulles could not "persuade" even some sober-minded people in the U.S. ruling group, let alone the broad masses of the American public. An American financier, James Warburg, said in his telegram to Eisenhower that the U.S. military action to keep the coastal islands under Chiang Kai-shek's control "is in effect interfering in China's civil war." Democratic Senator Morse also said, "Regarding Jinmen and Mazu, according to international law, the United States has no right to defend the Chinese Nationalists on these islands. If we go to defend them, we will be denounced as aggressors, and that is indeed the case." Dulles failed to "persuade" the Americans and could only "persuade" Eisenhower to personally come out to give the Americans another "re-persuasion." However, Eisenhower was unable to add anything other than repeating Dulles's clichés.
    The U.S. authorities' military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area have created an extremely serious danger of war. Any American with a little sense knows that the war that the people in the White House and the Pentagon want to provoke is an unjust war, a war with no hope of victory. A letter from a reader named Thomas published in the Baltimore Sun said: Dulles's threat to drag us into war for Jinmen Island, to send our sons to die for Chiang Kai-shek, is not in the interests of our people. An editorial in the Detroit Free Press said, "We seriously doubt whether one in a million Americans is willing to fight for Taiwan." "If we enter a world war simply to protect Chiang Kai-shek, who lives in Taiwan on our dollars, it is simply terrible." Indeed, what could be a more terrible disaster for the United States than a direct armed conflict with People's China? Nine years ago, didn't the United States spend four or five billion U.S. dollars to arm four or five million Kuomintang troops and drive them to launch a large-scale offensive against the Chinese People's Liberation Army? Five years ago, didn't the United States personally take action, mobilizing more than one million modern armed forces to compete with the people of China and Korea? The result is known to the world. The vast majority of the Kuomintang army was annihilated, and the remaining troops, together with the forces of U.S. imperialism, were driven out of mainland China. On the Korean battlefield, the U.S. aggressors, under the joint counterattack of the Chinese and Korean people's armies, were defeated and retreated to the vicinity of the original 38th parallel where they launched the aggression, and finally had to accept the armistice. Now, if the U.S. aggressors dare to launch a war against China, then, as former U.S. Secretary of the Army Hurley said, it would be tantamount to suicide. Former Secretary of State Acheson also pointed out, "In this war, we (referring to the United States) have neither friends nor allies."
    What is deplorable about U.S. imperialism is not only that its military adventurous policy is unpopular at home, but also that this policy does not receive the support of its "friends and allies." Eisenhower has probably seen that the situation is not good, so he shouted hoarsely in his speech: The Chinese people's liberation of their own territory is a "clear danger to the free world"; saying that "if Taiwan falls into the hands of the enemy, the Republic of the Philippines will be the next object of conquest"; saying that China's "ambitious plans" are "to eliminate all the positions of the free world in the Western Pacific"... Oh dear, it's really terrible, the Chinese have great "sins" and great "ambitions"! But this is a huge lie. It seems that Eisenhower is intimidating the American people, especially the friends and allies of the United States. He is playing the domino game, he is telling the American "friends and allies" to watch, the first domino falls, and the rest of the dominoes will follow. The Americans also said this four years ago when the Dien Bien Phu battle was going on, but the French (and the British) were not intimidated at the time, and still agreed to the Indochina armistice regardless of the opposition of the United States. Now, who believes in this kind of game? Many "friends and allies" of the United States really do not understand why the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory is a threat to other countries, is a threat to peace, and the United States sending its armed forces to the doorstep of China to interfere in China's internal affairs and carry out military provocations is instead "committed to glorious peace"? The Canadian Financial Times put it well: "Now the Chinese Communists are taking steps to eliminate the threat to their own door, and calling this aggression is utter nonsense." This newspaper also said, "Neither heaven nor mankind has appointed the United States the task of ruling all the rest of the world." The heads of government of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have expressed their unwillingness to be involved in the situation in Taiwan, and a spokesman for the British government has publicly stated that Britain "has not undertaken any obligations to the United States regarding the situation in the Far East." Thai Prime Minister Nai Thanom Kittikachorn believes that the situation in the Taiwan Strait is "very alarming," "but this is the Chinese people's own business." Even Philippine President Garcia has stated that the Philippines "does not have a treaty obligation to fight alongside the U.S. military." In Japan, government officials are very worried that the United States will drag Japan into a war against China.
    Eisenhower made himself out to be very pitiful, as if someone wanted to "trick or intimidate" him, as if someone wanted him to "succumb." We Chinese can declare that we do not want to "trick or intimidate" anyone, nor do we want anyone to "succumb." We do not want an inch of other countries' land, nor will we allow other countries to occupy an inch of our land. Eisenhower talked a lot about not "appeasing" in his speech, as if not interfering in China's internal affairs is "appeasement," and the United States carrying out armed intervention is called not "appeasing," which is really absurd. We Chinese people absolutely do not need anyone to appease us, on the contrary, we will never appease the aggressors. We will never appease the U.S. aggressors who have occupied our territory Taiwan and are carrying out military provocations in our coastal areas. In fact, since the end of World War II, the era of appeasing aggressors has gone forever. The people who fought for the independence and freedom of their motherland resolutely gave the aggressors a powerful blow. The Koreans and the Chinese did not appease the U.S. aggressors, we repelled their aggression and forced them to accept the armistice; the Vietnamese did not appease the French aggressors, resolutely resisted, and also forced them to accept the armistice; the Egyptians did not appease the British and French aggressors, and also resolutely resisted, finally forcing the invading armies to withdraw; the Syrians and other Arabs and the peace-loving people of the world did not appease U.S. imperialism, and waged a resolute struggle against the U.S. subversive conspiracies and war threats, finally crushing the U.S. conspiracies and threats; the Arabs and the peace-loving people of the world did not appease the U.S. and British imperialism's occupation of Lebanon and Jordan, unanimously stood up and resolutely struggled, forcing them to agree to the resolution passed by the UN General Assembly to withdraw their troops, although they are still trying to delay the withdrawal of troops. It is precisely because of this series of resolute struggles without appeasement that the ferocity of the aggressors has been curbed. If the Washington authorities still harbor any illusions that others will condone U.S. aggression, they should abandon them as soon as possible.
    Eisenhower also repeatedly mentioned "Munich" in his speech. Indeed, the people of the world remember "Munich," and know even better than Eisenhower what the essence of the "appeasement policy" of "Munich" is. That is the joint intervention of imperialist countries, forcing weak countries to give up their sovereignty. Eisenhower is unwilling or dare not to explicitly state this point, which precisely reflects his position as an aggressor. The Chinese people not only remember "Munich," but also remember the "Lansing-Ishii Agreement" of 1918, which was the beginning of the collusion between the U.S. and Japan to invade China, and paved the way for Japan's occupation of the three northeastern provinces of China. We also remember the "Far East Munich" conspiracy between Japan, the U.S., and Britain between 1937 and 1941, which was designed to sacrifice China and create an anti-communist, anti-Soviet situation. It was only because the people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party insisted on resisting the war and opposed Chiang Kai-shek's selling out of sovereignty that these conspiracies failed to materialize. The China of today is no longer the China of more than ten years ago, let alone the China of forty years ago. The China of today is no longer a weak country that can be manipulated and slaughtered by others, but a new and powerful country where 600 million people have mastered their own destiny. The days when imperialists united to intervene in China and force China to give up its sovereignty are gone forever.
    Not only is this the case in China, but throughout the world after World War II, the "Munich" era has also been declared dead. Just look at the Korean War, the Indochina War, the Suez Canal incident, and the recent revolution in Iraq and the crisis in the Middle East, which of these events did the imperialist forces headed by the United States not try to intervene in, or even directly carry out aggression? However, they did not succeed in any of them. Their plans of aggression have failed one after another, and the imperialist aggressors have been beaten bloody. Now is the era when the formerly oppressed and enslaved people of all countries have awakened and actively engaged in the struggle for freedom and independence, it is the era when the people of these countries handle their own affairs, it is the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind. Any intervention and aggression by imperialist forces will absolutely no longer be tolerated or appeased by the people. Taiwan is China's territory, and U.S. aggressors are absolutely not allowed to permanently occupy it through any conspiracy. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan at the appropriate time and in the appropriate way. Jinmen and Mazu are inland islands of China, and U.S. imperialism is absolutely not allowed to expand its scope of aggression here. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate the Chiang Kai-shek troops continuing to occupy Jinmen and Mazu, harassing and sabotaging our coastal areas. What the Chinese people are currently taking in the Taiwan Strait situation is precisely this attitude of never appeasing and never tolerating the aggression and interference of U.S. imperialism. This is the valuable experience we have gained at the cost of blood, and it is also the firm will of the great Chinese people that can never be shaken.
    Eisenhower expressed his hope in his speech to resolve the international disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan Strait area through the "path of negotiation." If this is not to deceive world public opinion, it is certainly not a bad thing. The Chinese government has stated that in order to make another effort to maintain peace, China is ready to resume ambassadorial talks between the two countries. However, just as the talks are about to begin, U.S. warships and aircraft, disregarding the warnings of the Chinese government, have repeatedly invaded China's territorial waters and airspace, filling the Taiwan Strait situation with serious danger. If the United States does not stop this dangerous provocation, it will cause serious consequences. Eisenhower said time and again that he "believes there will be no war," but if he is unwilling to stop this military provocation, then simply playing with lies and sophistry, in Eisenhower's own words, will absolutely "not deceive or control world public opinion." How sincere the United States is about taking the "path of negotiation" will soon be tested. The Chinese people will judge whether Eisenhower's "ardent hope" for peace is true or false based on the actions of the United States.

    骗不了也吓不倒
    美国总统艾森豪威尔9月11日发表了一篇广播演说。在这篇演说中，这位美国总统极尽诬蔑之能事，把伟大的人民中国咒骂为“强有力的独裁政权”、“残忍的暴君”、“好战的和侵略成性的”、“大侵略者”……大概他把从美国字典中能够找到的这类最恶毒的词儿几乎都用上了。这些咒骂，用在美帝国主义自己身上倒是最恰当不过的。对于我们中国人民来说，来自国内外反动派的这一类咒骂我们早就听惯了。咒骂既不能淹没真理，也不能阻挡历史车轮的前进。我们中华人民共和国，就是在这样的咒骂声中成长和壮大起来的。这样的咒骂如果说有任何意义，那只不过证明我们中国人民做得对，做得好，因而原来指望我们屈服或者“消逝”的敌人大失所望、老羞成怒而已。艾森豪威尔不是不知道，任何咆哮，不论是发自白宫或五角大楼的咆哮，也不论是九年以前国民党军队在大陆上使用的或者五年以前美国军队在朝鲜前线亲自发射的美国大炮的咆哮，都吓不倒伟大的中国人民。白宫主人这次大发雷霆，据美国报纸披露，为的是平息国内舆论对美国当局在台湾海峡地区所采取的军事冒险政策的强烈不满，也为的是“说服”那些生怕被套在美国战车上而极力表白对台湾地区局势采取“事不关己、高高挂起”的态度的美国的国外“朋友和盟国”。看来，美国当局由于它在台湾海峡地区实行一种极端危险的侵略政策而陷于极端孤立的地位，这大概就是艾森豪威尔发表这篇广播演说的背景。
    大家知道，中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿如金门、马祖，完全是中国的内政。而美国当局用武装力量占领了中国领土台湾，并且在台湾海峡地区对中国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，分明是对中国内政的粗暴的干涉，是彰明昭著的侵略行为。十天以前，艾森豪威尔曾经授权杜勒斯发表声明，力图掩饰美国行动的侵略性质，并且把中国人民解放自己领土的正义行动说成是“破坏作为世界秩序的基础的原则”，“危及自由世界的极为重要的阵地和美国的安全”。杜勒斯的这些谎言，就连美国统治集团中某些头脑清醒的人都“说服”不了，更不用说对于美国广大公众了。美国的一位金融家詹姆斯·华伯在他给艾森豪威尔的电报中说，美国采取军事行动使沿海岛屿继续置于蒋介石的控制下，“实际上就是干涉中国的内战”。民主党的参议员莫尔斯也说，“关于金门和马祖，根据国际法，美国无权保卫这些岛屿上的中国国民党人。如果我们去保卫他们，我们就会被斥为侵略者，而且事实也的确这样。”杜勒斯没有“说服”美国人，只能“说服”艾森豪威尔亲自出马来对美国人进行一次“再说服”。可是，艾森豪威尔除了重复杜勒斯的滥调外也没有能够增添什么。
    美国当局在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅，造成了极端严重的战争危险。稍有头脑的美国人都知道，白宫和五角大楼的人们要挑起的这场战争是不义的战争，是没有胜利希望的战争。巴尔的摩太阳报发表的读者托马斯的来信说：杜勒斯扬言要为金门岛而把我们卷入战争，要为蒋介石而把我们的儿子派去送死，这是不符合我国人民的利益的。底特律自由日报的社论说，“我们十分怀疑，一百万美国人中是否有一个人愿意为台湾作战”。“如果只是为了保护依靠我国的美元生活在台湾的蒋介石而进入世界大战，这简直是可怕的事”。事实的确如此，有什么比同人民中国发生直接的武力冲突对美国来说是更可怕的灾难呢？九年以前，美国不是花了四、五十亿美元来武装四、五百万的国民党军队，并驱使他们向中国人民解放军大举进攻吗？五年以前，美国不是亲自出马，调动了一百多万现代化的武装部队同朝中两国人民较量过吗？结果是举世周知的。国民党的军队的绝大部分被歼灭了，残余的部队连同美帝国主义势力一起被赶出了中国大陆。在朝鲜战场上美国侵略者在朝中人民军队的联合反击下，败退到原来发动侵略的三八线附近，最后不得不接受停战。现在如果美国侵略者胆敢发动对中国的战争，那末，正如美国前陆军部长赫尔利所说的，等于自杀。前国务卿艾奇逊也指出，“在这场战争中，我们（指美国）既没有朋友，也没有盟国”。
    美帝国主义可悲的，不仅是它的军事冒险政策在国内不得人心，而且还在于这个政策也得不到它的“朋友和盟国”的支持。艾森豪威尔大概已经看到形势不妙，所以他在演说中力竭声嘶地叫喊：中国人民要解放自己的领土是“对自由世界的清楚的危险”；说什么“如果台湾落入敌人手中，菲律宾共和国就会是下一个被征服的对象”；说什么中国的“野心计划”是“要消除自由世界在西太平洋地区的一切阵地”……哎哟哟，真是不得了，中国人有天大的“罪恶”，天大的“野心”！但是，这却是天大的撒谎。看来艾森豪威尔在恐吓美国人民，特别是要恐吓美国的朋友和盟国。他在玩骨牌游戏，他叫美国的“朋友和盟国”看着，头一张骨牌倒下来，其余的骨牌也会跟着倒的。美国人在四年前奠边府战斗正在进行的时候也曾经这样说过，可是当时法国人（还有英国人）并没有被吓倒，仍然不顾美国的反对而同意了印度支那停战。现在，又有谁相信这种游戏呢？美国的许多“朋友和盟国”实在不懂，为什么中国人民要解放自己的领土，就是威胁别的国家，就是威胁和平，而美国把它的武装力量派到中国的大门口去干涉中国的内政，并且进行军事挑衅，反倒是“致力于光荣的和平”呢？加拿大的金融时报说得好：“现在中国共产党人正在采取步骤来消除自己大门的威胁，把这叫做侵略完全是胡说八道。”这家报纸又说，“不论苍天或者人类都没有委派美国统治世界所有其余地方的任务”。加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰的政府首脑已经表示不愿牵涉到台湾的局势中去，英国政府的发言人已公开声明英国“并没有对美国承担关于远东局势的任何义务”。泰国总理乃他侬·吉滴卡宗认为，台湾海峡局势“十分令人惊惶”，“但这是中国人民自己的事情”。甚至菲律宾总统加西亚也曾表示，菲律宾“并没有同美军一起作战的条约义务”。在日本，政府的负责官员倒十分耽心美国把日本拖入对中国的战争中去。
    艾森豪威尔把自己说得很可怜，似乎有什么人要“诱骗或者恐吓”他，似乎有什么人要他“屈服”。我们中国人可以声明，我们既不想“诱骗或者恐吓”任何人，也没有叫任何人“屈服”。我们不要别国一寸土地，也决不让别国侵占我们一寸土地。艾森豪威尔在他的演说中大谈不要“姑息”，似乎不干涉中国的内政就是“姑息”，美国进行武装干涉就叫做不“姑息”，这真是无稽的奇谈。我们中国人绝不需要什么人姑息，恰恰相反，我们对侵略者倒是绝不姑息的。我们对于侵占我国领土台湾和在我国沿海进行军事挑衅的美国侵略者就绝不姑息。事实上自从第二次世界大战结束以来，对侵略者姑息的时代已经一去不复返了。为祖国的独立和自由而斗争的人民，坚决地给了侵略者以有力的打击。朝鲜人和中国人没有对美国侵略者姑息，我们击退了它的侵略，迫使它接受停战；越南人没有对法国侵略者姑息，坚决地进行了反抗，也迫使它接受停战；埃及人也没有对英法侵略者姑息，也坚决地进行了抵抗，终于迫使侵略军队撤退；叙利亚人和其他阿拉伯人以及全世界爱好和平人民也没有对美帝国主义姑息，对美国的颠复阴谋和战争威胁进行了坚决的斗争，终于粉碎了美国的阴谋和威胁；阿拉伯人和全世界爱好和平人民对美英帝国主义侵占黎巴嫩和约旦也没有姑息，一致起来坚决进行斗争，迫使它们不能不同意联合国大会通过的规定要撤出它们的军队的决议，虽然现在它们仍然力图拖延撤兵。正是由于这一系列的毫不姑息的坚决斗争，才遏止了侵略者的凶焰。华盛顿当局如果还抱着指望别人会姑息美国的侵略行径的任何幻想，还是趁早抛弃为妙。
    艾森豪威尔在演说里还一再提到了“慕尼黑”。不错，全世界人民记得“慕尼黑”，而且比艾森豪威尔更知道“慕尼黑”的“姑息政策”的实质是什么。那就是帝国主义国家联合进行干涉，强迫弱小国家放弃主权。艾森豪威尔不愿意或者不敢把这点明确说出来，恰恰反映了他的侵略者的立场。中国人民不仅记得“慕尼黑”，而且记得1918年的“蓝辛石井协定”，这是美日合谋侵略中国的开始，并为以后日本霸占中国东北三省铺平了道路。我们还记得1937年到1941年之间，日美英之间几次策划的牺牲中国、造成反共、反苏局面的“远东慕尼黑”的阴谋。只是由于中国共产党领导下的人民坚持抗战，反对蒋介石出卖主权，这些阴谋才未能实现。现在的中国已经不是十几年前的中国，更不是四十年前的中国了。现在的中国已经不是任人摆布、任人宰割的孱弱的国家，而是六万万人民掌握了自己命运的新生的强大的国家了。帝国主义联合起来干涉中国、强迫中国放弃主权的日子已经一去不复返了。
    不仅中国如此，在第二次世界大战之后，在整个世界范围内，“慕尼黑”时代也已经宣告了死亡。试看，朝鲜战争、印度支那战争、苏伊士运河事件以及最近伊拉克的革命和中东的危机，哪一桩事件，以美国为首的帝国主义势力没有试图干涉过，甚至直接进行了侵略？然而哪一件他们也没有干涉得了。它们的侵略计划一次接一次地失败了，帝国主义侵略者都被打得头破血流。现在是过去被压迫、被奴役的各国人民觉醒起来，积极投入争自由、争独立的时代了，是这些国家的人民自己处理自己的事情的时代了，是东风压倒西风的时代了。帝国主义势力任何干涉和侵略，都绝对不会再为人民所容忍、姑息。台湾是中国的领土，绝不容许美国侵略者通过任何阴谋长期霸占。中国人民决心在适当的时候，用适当的方法，解放台湾。金门和马祖是中国的内海岛屿，决不容美帝国主义把它的侵略范围扩大到这里。中国人民决不能容忍蒋介石部队继续盘据金门、马祖，骚扰和破坏我沿海地区。中国人民目前在台湾海峡局势中所采取的就是这种决不姑息、决不容忍美帝国主义的侵略和干涉的态度。这是我们付出鲜血的代价换取来的宝贵经验，也是伟大的中国人民绝不可能动摇的坚强意志。
    艾森豪威尔在演说中表示希望通过“谈判的道路”来解决中国和美国在台湾海峡地区的国际争端。如果这不是为了欺骗世界舆论，当然不是坏事。中国政府已经声明，为了再一次进行维护和平的努力，中国准备恢复两国大使级会谈。但是，就在会谈快要开始的时候，美国军舰、飞机却不顾中国政府的警告，再三再四地侵犯中国的领海、领空，使台湾海峡的局势充满着严重的危险。如果美国不停止这种危险的挑衅，那就会引起严重的后果。艾森豪威尔口口声声说“相信不会有战争”，如果又不肯停止这种军事挑衅，那末，光是玩弄谎言和诡辩，用艾森豪威尔自己的话来说，是绝对“欺骗不了也控制不了世界舆论的”。美国究竟对于走“谈判的道路”有多少诚意，不久就要受到考验。中国人民将根据美国的行动来判断艾森豪威尔关于和平的“热诚希望”究竟是真是假。
