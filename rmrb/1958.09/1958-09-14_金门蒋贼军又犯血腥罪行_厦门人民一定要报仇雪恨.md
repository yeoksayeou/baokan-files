Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, September 13th: On the afternoon of September 11th, the Kinmen Chiang Kai-shek troops, who are cruel to the people, frantically shelled peaceful residents in Jiangtou Township and other areas of Xiamen City, killing one resident and wounding eighteen others on the spot. They also killed three water buffaloes and destroyed more than ten civilian houses. Lu Changling, a pedicab worker, had his head shattered by a US-made artillery shell and died in a pool of blood. Zou Donglian, a mother of three young children, suffered severe shrapnel wounds to her left arm and chest.

This is another new crime committed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops with the direct support of US imperialism.

The Kinmen Chiang Kai-shek troops' successive bloody crimes of frantically shelling peaceful residents and students have aroused immense indignation among people from all walks of life in Xiamen City. Zheng Yuedian, who was wounded by Chiang's artillery fire, specifically instructed the doctor to dry and preserve his blood-stained clothes as he was being carried to the hospital. He said: "The Chiang bandits shelled my alma mater, Xiamen University, on the 9th, and today they wounded my arm. I will never forget these blood debts! When I recover, I will actively support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Kinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan, and eliminate the Chiang bandits!" Chen Jinxian, a stevedore worker whose back was wounded by Chiang Kai-shek's artillery shell, clenched his teeth on the spot and dug the shrapnel out of his flesh with his hands. He said, "These shells are made in the United States. I must do a better job in supporting the front-line transportation work, support the People's Liberation Army, and completely crush the military provocations and war threats of the American aggressors."

People from all over the country expressed great anger at the bloody crimes committed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops in frantically killing peaceful residents and students in Xiamen. They sent telegrams and letters to express their condolences to the people of Xiamen who are standing on the front line of the struggle, expressing their determination to be their strong backing and to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Kinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan with all kinds of practical actions.
