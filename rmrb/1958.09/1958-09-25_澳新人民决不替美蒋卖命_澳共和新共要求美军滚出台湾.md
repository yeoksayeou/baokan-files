Xinhua News Agency, September 24th, Sydney dispatch:  General Secretary of the Australian Communist Party, Sharkey, stated at the beginning of his campaign for the Australian Federal Parliamentary elections that the policy of the Australian Communist Party is to demand the withdrawal of all American troops from the Taiwan area, return these islands to China, restore China's seat in the United Nations and the Security Council, and for the Australian government to recognize China.

Sharkey said, "We oppose any attempt to involve Australia in aggression against China. Who can say that Australians should be sent to fight for a scoundrel like Chiang Kai-shek?"

Sharkey refuted the absurd claim made by the United States that Taiwan and China's coastal islands are "extremely important to the security" of the United States.

Some Australian trade union organizations have recently demanded that US troops withdraw from the Taiwan area and that the Australian government recognize China. The Federal Conference of the Building Workers' Industrial Union, representing 50,000 members, sent a resolution to the US Ambassador to Australia, Sebald. The resolution stated that Taiwan is part of China, the United States should get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, and China should obtain its legitimate seat in the United Nations and the Security Council. Trade union organizations such as the Queensland Trades and Labour Council, which represents all trade unions in Queensland, have also passed similar resolutions.

According to a Wellington dispatch: The New Zealand Communist Party recently issued a statement calling on the New Zealand people to oppose wars waged for Chiang Kai-shek and American tycoons.

    澳新人民决不替美蒋卖命
    澳共和新共要求美军滚出台湾
    新华社24日讯  悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党总书记夏基在澳大利亚联邦议会选举的竞选运动开始时发表演说说，澳大利亚共产党的政策是：要求撤退在台湾地区的所有美国军队，把这些岛屿归还中国；恢复中国在联合国和安全理事会中的席位；澳大利亚政府承认中国。
    夏基说，“我们反对任何企图使澳大利亚卷入对中国的侵略的作法。谁能说应当把澳大利亚人派去为蒋介石这样的恶徒作战呢？”
    夏基驳斥了美国提出的所谓台湾和中国的沿海岛屿对美国的“安全极为重要”这种荒谬的说法。
    澳大利亚的一些工会组织最近纷纷要求美国军队撤出台湾地区，并且要求澳大利亚政府承认中国。代表五万会员的建筑工人工会联邦会议把一分决议送交美国驻澳大利亚大使赛鲍尔。决议说，台湾是中国的一部分，美国应该滚出台湾和台湾海峡地区；中国应该取得它在联合国和安全理事会中的合法席位。代表昆士兰州所有工会的昆士兰州劳工理事会等工会组织也都通过了类似的决议。
    另据惠灵顿消息：新西兰共产党最近发表声明，号召新西兰人民反对为蒋介石和美国的富豪而进行的战争。
