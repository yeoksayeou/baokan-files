Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 12th: The First Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Ulbricht, gave a talk on national television this evening regarding the issue of a German peace treaty and German reunification. He said that the reunification of Germany is entirely a matter for the German people themselves. Without mutual understanding between the representatives of the two German states, the reunification of Germany is impossible.

Ulbricht said that not long ago, the government of the German Democratic Republic suggested in a note to the Four Powers that a committee be established to draft a German peace treaty. Because the Four Powers bear responsibility for preparing the issue of a German peace treaty, and the Four Powers should recognize that it is necessary for them to promote understanding between the two Germanies.

Ulbricht pointed out that the recent note from the West German government to the Four Powers has no positive elements. It is characterized by simply relying on the Four Powers to solve the issue of German reunification, and its purpose is obviously to confuse public opinion.

Ulbricht further pointed out that the secret plan formulated by the so-called Four-Power Working Group composed of representatives from the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany has nothing to do with the peaceful reunification of Germany. It is a military plan of West German militarists. This plan attempts to use the force of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops stationed in West Germany to enable West German militarists to obtain a majority in the National Assembly "elections" in order to expand the occupied area of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops to the Oder River.

Ulbricht finally said that no problem can be solved without the opinion of the people. Now is the time for the people to speak.

    德国统一是德国人民自己的事
    乌布利希指责西德照会混淆视听
    新华社柏林12日电　德意志民主共和国第一副总理乌布利希今晚就对德和约和德国重新统一问题在全国电视广播节目中发表了谈话。他说，德国的重新统一完全是德国人民自己的事情。没有两个德国国家代表的相互谅解，德国的重新统一是不可能的。
    乌布利希说，不久以前德意志民主共和国政府在给四大国的照会中建议成立一个起草对德和约委员会。因为四大国对于准备对德和约问题负有责任，并且四大国应该认识到它们有必要促进两个德国之间的谅解。
    乌布利希指出，西德政府最近给四大国的照会没有任何积极因素。它的特点是单纯依靠四大国来解决德国的重新统一问题，其目的显然是想混淆人们的视听。
    乌布利希又指出，由美、英、法、西德代表组成的所谓四国工作组所制定的秘密计划是和德国的和平统一毫不相干的。它是一个西德军国主义者的军事计划。这个计划是企图借助于驻西德的北大西洋公约组织军队的武力来使西德军国主义者取得国民议会“选举”的多数，以便把北大西洋公约组织军队的占领区扩张到奥得河边。
    乌布利希最后说，没有人民的意见就不可能解决任何问题。现在是人民说话的时候了。
