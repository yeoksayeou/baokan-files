Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: This year's National Day finds the nation's rural areas celebrating a double happiness: a comprehensive bumper harvest and the realization of people's communes. In the days leading up to National Day, the countryside is filled with joy, and people's communes everywhere are preparing to launch celebrations focused on the joy of the harvest.

In recent days, from the frontiers to the interior, many villages have been cleaned up and are sporting a new look. Thousands upon thousands of farmer-artists are using their artistic talents to decorate their villages. They have painted many large-scale pictures on the walls celebrating the bumper harvest, demonstrating the superiority of the people's communes, and celebrating National Day, and have written slogans striving for an even greater leap forward next year. In the vast rural areas of Zhejiang Province, many "Leap Forward Gates," "Harvest Gates," and "Happiness Gates" decorated with lanterns and colored streamers have been erected on the main roads, and villages are rushing to build decorative archways. In many villages in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, families have posted couplets celebrating the harvest on their doors.

Various gatherings celebrating the bumper harvest, the establishment of people's communes, and National Day have already begun in many places. On the Mid-Autumn Festival—the 27th—the Qiliying People's Commune in Henan Province slaughtered large, fat pigs, prepared many delicious dishes and fried foods, and held a grand feast to celebrate the harvest. On the evening of the 27th, members of the Nandangjia Village production team of the "Satellite" People's Commune in Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, and the forty-eight workers from the county's cotton, wool, and textile factory who came to help with the autumn harvest held a joint celebration of the harvest and welcomed National Day. Members of all ethnic groups of the Hongqi People's Commune in Huanjiang County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, composed more than 20,000 folk songs singing about the bumper harvest and praising the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. On the evening of the 27th, more than 15,000 people from the entire commune held a grand feast to celebrate the harvest and National Day. In the evening, gongs and drums resounded, songs filled the land, and a celebratory evening party was held. Members of the Honglao Agricultural Cooperative in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao filled with excitement and joy to report the good news of the harvest.

More people's communes are preparing to hold various activities to celebrate the bumper harvest and National Day on National Day itself. At that time, people's communes everywhere will hold celebration rallies and parades; millions of militiamen will be reviewed; pigs and sheep will be slaughtered for grand feasts and cultural entertainment evenings; and exhibitions introducing the great leap forward in industry and agriculture will be held. Members of people's communes in Zhejiang Province are using their rest time from intense labor to rehearse dramas, ballads, songs, dances, dragon lanterns, lion dances, and other programs. The vast members in Liaoning, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, and other provinces and regions are also actively preparing cultural and artistic programs. Liaoning Province has also organized and trained more than 24,000 speakers and 1.2 million propagandists, preparing to explain to the vast members of the people's communes the great achievements of socialist construction over the past year and the plans for a greater leap forward next year.

In order to meet the needs of the vast rural areas during the festival, commercial departments in various places have been rushing to transport various materials to grassroots stores and supply and marketing cooperatives in recent days. Members of people's communes in the Neijiang Special District of Sichuan Province are preparing to eat glutinous rice balls on National Day to express their happiness and satisfaction, and the commercial departments have supplied a large amount of white sugar. Grassroots stores and supply and marketing cooperatives in Liaoning Province have supplied farmers with many festive items—candles, colored paper, and firecrackers.

    据新华社29日讯  今年国庆节，全国农村中正逢双喜临门——全面大丰收、实现人民公社化。国庆前夕，农村中喜气洋洋，各地人民公社普遍准备展开以喜庆丰收为主的庆祝活动。
    这几天来，从边疆到内地，很多村庄都打扫得干干净净，面貌一新。成千上万的农民艺术家正用他们的艺术天才打扮自己的村庄。他们在墙上画了很多喜庆大丰收、表现人民公社优越性和庆祝国庆的大幅画图，写了力争明年更大跃进的标语。浙江省广大农村的要道上已经搭起了许多张灯结彩的“跃进门”、“丰收门”和“幸福门”，村里正在赶扎牌楼。广西僮族自治区很多村庄家家户户的大门上都贴上了庆贺丰收的对联。
    很多地方的农民庆祝大丰收、庆祝成立人民公社和国庆节的各种集会活动已经展开了。河南省七里营人民公社在中秋节——27日这一天，杀了大肥猪，作了许多好菜和油炸食品，举行了庆祝丰收的大会餐。山西省介休县“卫星”人民公社南当家庄生产队的社员们，在27日晚上，和赶来帮助秋收的县棉毛纺织厂的四十八名工人举行了庆丰收迎国庆的联欢晚会。广西僮族自治区环江县红旗人民公社的各族社员，新编了二万多支山歌歌唱大丰收，歌唱共产党和毛主席。27日晚，全社一万五千多人举行了庆丰收、贺国庆的大会餐。晚上锣鼓喧天，歌声遍地，举行了联欢晚会。四川省郫县红老农业社社员们在喜庆丰收的时候，怀着激动的心情给毛主席写了一封报喜信。
    更多的人民公社都准备在国庆节这一天举行庆祝大丰收、庆祝国庆节的各种活动。届时，各地人民公社都将举行庆祝大会和游行；千百万民兵将接受检阅；还要杀猪宰羊举行大会餐和文化娱乐晚会，并要举办介绍工农业大跃进的展览会。浙江省各地人民公社社员正用紧张劳动的休息时间排练戏剧、说唱、歌咏、舞蹈、龙灯、狮舞等节目。辽宁、吉林、内蒙、四川等省区的广大社员也在积极准备文娱节目。辽宁省还组织和培训了二万四千多名报告员、一百二十万名宣传员，准备给广大人民公社社员讲解一年来社会主义建设事业的伟大成就和明年更大跃进的规划。
    为了满足广大农村节日的需要，这些天来各地商业部门都赶运了各种物资到基层商店和供销社。四川省内江专区各人民公社社员准备在国庆节这一天做汤元吃，表示圆满高兴，商业部门即供应了大量白糖。辽宁省各基层商店和供销社供应农民很多节日用品——蜡烛、彩纸和鞭炮。
