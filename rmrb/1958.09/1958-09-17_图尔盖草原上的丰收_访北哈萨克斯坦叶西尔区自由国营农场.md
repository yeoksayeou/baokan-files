    Harvest on the Turgai Steppe
    ——Visiting the Free State Farm in Yesil District, Northern Kazakhstan
    By our reporters Chen Quanbi and Cui Yongchang

    People still habitually call the Free State Farm in Yesil District "Tselina" (virgin land) because it was born on virgin land. However, this name is now completely untrue. Not only are there endless wheat fields here, but a new and lively town is also taking shape, with hundreds of new agricultural workers' residences neatly arranged along the main streets of the farm center. Hospitals, schools, shops, clubs, canteens, bakeries, bathhouses, nurseries... have been built here. Four years ago, this desolate place is now full of neighbors.

    The old farm manager of the Free Farm, Belopaki, a Party member with thirty years of experience, braved the heavy rain to meet us at the Yesil Railway Station, twenty kilometers away. But when we arrived at the farm, the sky was clear. The changeable climate of the northern Kazakhstan steppe really made us visitors from afar feel unpredictable.

    The farm is harvesting, the tall wheat stalks are topped with heavy, thick, and long ears of wheat. Everywhere is filled with an atmosphere of joy because this year is the biggest harvest in the four years since the farm was established. In the great harvest of 1956, the Free Farm delivered a total of 1.7 million poods of grain to the state, with an average yield of 15 centners per hectare. This year, the average yield per hectare is expected to be 20 centners, and 2 million poods of grain can be delivered to the state. The Akmolinsk Oblast, where the Free Farm is located, has had a bumper harvest this year. This oblast will sell 220 million poods of grain to the state this year. This figure is equivalent to the total amount of grain delivered by the two border regions of Kuban and Stavropol, which are famous for grain production, and is equivalent to half of the grain delivered by Ukraine, which is known as the granary of the Soviet Union. The director of the Akmolinsk Oblast Agricultural Bureau told me: If these grains are loaded into train cars and connected, its length will reach 14,000 kilometers, which is equivalent to the distance from Berlin to Beijing.

    The harvesting work of the Free Farm has been going on for the fourth day. In order to seize the opportunity, everyone on the farm has joined the intense battle. Many people are working day and night. Like Lusman, the captain of the first work team of the farm. He is a Communist Party member and won the Order of Lenin in 1956 for his outstanding labor achievements. He hasn't slept for several days now, and all twenty combine harvesters in his work team have been put into battle. This year, they are responsible for the harvesting of 5,200 hectares. Combine harvester Ivanov also works all night long. His boundless energy enables his work quota to be broken time and time again. He has harvested 120 hectares of millet in the past three days, exceeding the quota by one time. The combine harvester Matveyev and his younger brother Mikhail from the fifth work team jointly operate a combine harvester. The two brothers have also not rested for four days. Matveyev told us that his son, whom he added on the wasteland, just turned one year old yesterday, but he was too busy harvesting to go home to see him. There are really countless people on the farm who haven't slept for several days, these selfless laborers!

    Yes, how can the harvest be separated from people's hard work! The Free Farm has only been established for four years. In this short period of time, so much wasteland has been opened up, such a good harvest has been cultivated, and such a beautiful town has been built. It is conceivable how much labor and sleepless nights are contained in this great achievement. The 55-year-old farm manager Belopaki naturally talked about the hard-working spirit of all the staff, especially the arduous struggle during the construction of the farm in 1954 when he talked to us about the various achievements of the farm.

    It was early spring in March, the Turgai Steppe was very cold, and snowy whirlwinds blew all day long. The wind force was sometimes as high as a dozen levels, and the temperature often dropped to minus 38 to 40 degrees Celsius. Belopaki led more than 300 young people from all over the country to the wasteland. At that time, the most difficult thing was that there was no place to live, and they could only live in ventilated carriages and some temporary tents. They ate some dry and hard bread and canned food that they brought with them. The biggest difficulty was that they could not get water. But even so, they started a courageous battle, and after the snow melted, they did a good job in surveying the land and preparing for reclamation. By August, all 25,000 hectares of virgin land needed by the farm had been plowed. At that time, a few young people were driven by momentary enthusiasm and lacked a real understanding of the great and arduous cause. They could not bear the severe cold of winter and the scorching heat of summer, and left during the most difficult construction period of the farm. This old Communist Party member Belopaki led the remaining people who had undergone rigorous tests, step by step, and finally changed the face of the wasteland, built the Free Farm, and developed the Party and League organizations on the farm, consolidated the farm, and made the farm move forward quickly year by year. It was because of these achievements that Belopaki was awarded the Order of Lenin.

    Not only the Free Farm, but also the Akmolinsk Oblast, the virgin land of Kazakhstan has generally had a bumper harvest this year. The people of the whole Soviet Union are cheering for this. Many enthusiastic supporters have come from all over the country to help the wasteland harvest. The director of the Akmolinsk Oblast Agricultural Bureau told us that the number of people supporting the Akmolinsk Oblast alone is 50,000, 10,000 came to the wasteland of Yesil District, and 300 came to the Free Farm. These 300 people are all young people, and they come from Rostov, Kiev and the Komi Autonomous Republic. When we went to visit the threshing ground of the third work team, a group of girls waved to us from afar and shouted loudly "Come and help". But when we approached and saw clearly that we were Chinese, the girls became shy. A group of female students from the Rostov Institute of Architecture were cleaning wheat on the threshing ground. Four or five winnowing machines kept spitting out golden wheat grains. In the past few days, they have cleared dozens of piles of wheat. Ponoma Rinkova, an eighteen-year-old sophomore, told us that the students from their college were led by Kusyuninko, a teacher in the design department. The female students all participated in winnowing wheat, and some of the male students drove combine harvesters and helped the farm build a canteen. They all hoped to contribute their strength to the wasteland and get exercise in labor. A nineteen-year-old girl, Kuznetsova, from the Komi Autonomous Republic, ran from another threshing ground. She is a sophomore in the Department of Mathematics and Physics at the Komi Normal College. She told us that she was very concerned about the young women in China and asked carefully about the life and study of Chinese young students. When we were about to leave, she also wrote on our notebooks her cordial care and wishes for the young people in China.

    The wasteland has undergone tremendous changes in the past four years. It has completely changed the face that people imagined. Modern and highly mechanized state-owned farms have been firmly established. The wasteland, everything is on the right track, and people's lives are very stable and happy. In order to further develop the wasteland, they have put forward the slogan of developing animal husbandry so that they can be compensated in animal husbandry when the grain harvest is poor in dry years. They also want to develop transportation so that thousands of tons of grain can be quickly transported to the whole country to support construction in various places. They also want to further train technical cadres and further improve the welfare of the people in the wasteland. Undoubtedly, in a few years, the face of the wasteland will undergo tremendous changes, and it will play a greater role in the communist construction cause of its country. Look, how plump the golden wheat grains are! Soviet News

    图尔盖草原上的丰收
    ——访北哈萨克斯坦叶西尔区自由国营农场
    本报记者  陈泉璧  崔永昌
    人们仍然习惯地把叶西尔区的自由国营农场叫做切林娜（荒地），因为它就是诞生在荒地上的。但是，这个称呼，如今已完全名不符实了。这里不仅麦田一望无际，一个新的热闹的市镇也正在形成，成百座新的农业工人的住宅，在农场中心的几条大街两旁整齐地排列着。这里已建起了医院、学校、商店、俱乐部、食堂、面包房、浴室、托儿所……。四年前这荒无人烟的地方，现在已经是邻舍栉比、鸡犬相闻了。
    自由农场的老场长、有着三十年党龄的别洛帕基冒着大雨到二十公里外的叶西尔火车站来迎接我们。但当我们到达农场时，却已是万里晴空。哈萨克北部草原多变的气候，真使我们远道来访者感到变幻莫测。
    农场正在收割，高高的麦秆上，沉甸甸的麦穗又粗又长。到处洋溢着喜悦的气氛，因为今年是他们建场四年来空前大丰收的一年。1956年的大丰收，自由农场共交给国家一百七十万普特粮食，平均每公顷打下十五公担。今年每公顷平均可打二十公担，可交给国家二百万普特粮食。自由农场所在地的阿克莫林斯克州今年普遍丰收，这个州今年要向国家交售二亿二千万普特粮食，这个数字相当于以盛产粮食著名的库班和斯塔夫罗波尔两个边疆区所交粮食的总和，相当于素称苏联谷仓乌克兰上交粮食的一半。阿克莫林斯克州的农业局长告诉我：如果把这些粮食装成车皮连接起来，它的长度要达到一万四千公里，相当于从柏林到北京的距离。
    自由农场的收割工作已经是第四天了，为了抓紧时机，全场的人都投入了紧张的战斗。许多人都是夜以继日地工作着。像农场第一工作队的队长路司曼就是。他是共产党员，1956年就因卓越的劳动成绩而获得了列宁勋章。他现在已经好几天没有睡觉了，他的这个工作队的二十部收割联合机已全部投入了战斗。他们今年要负责五千二百公顷的收割工作。联合机手伊凡诺夫也是连夜工作的，他的无限充沛的精力，使他的工作定额一次次地被突破。他三天来已收割了一百二十公顷糜子，超过定额一倍。第五工作队的联合机手马特维也夫和他的弟弟米海也夫共同操纵一架收割联合机，他们弟兄俩也是四天没有休息了。马特维也夫告诉我们，他在荒地添的儿子昨天刚满周岁，但忙着收割没有时间回家去看他。农场上这种一连几天不睡觉的人，这种忘我的劳动者，真是数也数不过来啊！
    是的，丰收怎么能同人们的辛勤劳动分得开呢！自由农场才建立四年，在这短短的时间内，开了这么多荒地，培育了这么好的收成，还建成了一座这么漂亮的市镇。这巨大的成就，包含着多少劳动和不眠的夜，是可想而知的。五十五岁的老场长别洛帕基同我们谈起农场的各项成就时，也很自然地谈起了全场人员的苦干精神，特别是1954年建场时艰苦斗争的情况。
    那是初春3月，图尔盖草原非常寒冷，整天刮着带雪的旋风，风力有时大到十几级，气温经常冷到零下三十八度到四十度。别洛帕基带着来自全国各地的三百多名青年人来到荒地。那时最困难的是没有地方住，只能住在透风的车厢里和一部分临时搭成的帐篷里。吃的是带来的一些干硬的面包干和罐头。最大的困难还是喝不到水。但就是这样，他们开始了勇敢的战斗，在溶雪以后就把土地的丈量工作和开荒的准备工作做好。到8月以前就把农场所需要的二万五千公顷处女地全部翻耕过来。当时有少数青年为一时的热情所驱使，对伟大艰苦的事业缺乏真正的认识，他们忍受不了严冬的酷寒和夏日的烈炎，在农场最艰苦的建设时期离开了。这位老共产党员别洛帕基率领着留下来的经受过严格考验的人们，一步步地终于把荒地的面貌改变了，建成了自由农场，并且在农场发展了党团组织，巩固了农场，使农场一年年快步前进着。就是因为这些功绩，别洛帕基荣获了列宁勋章。
    不仅自由农场，也不仅阿克莫林斯克州，今年哈萨克斯坦的荒地普遍丰收。苏联全国人民都在为此而欢欣鼓舞。从全国各地来了许多热情的支援者，帮助荒地来收割。阿克莫林斯克州的农业局长告诉我们，单是全国支援阿克莫林斯克州的人数就有五万人，到叶西尔区荒地来的是一万人，到自由农场的有三百人。这三百人全部是青年，他们来自罗斯托夫、基辅和科米自治共和国。我们到第三工作队的打谷场上去访问时，一群姑娘远远地向我们招手，并高声地喊着“快来帮忙啊”。但当我们走近，看清我们是中国人时，姑娘们却羞涩起来。罗斯托夫建筑学院的一群女学生正在打谷场上做麦子的清扬工作，四、五架扬谷机不断地吐出金黄的麦粒，几天来她们清扬的麦子已有几十堆。二年级学生，十八岁的波诺马林科娃向我们说：他们学院的学生是由设计系的教师库斯忧宁科带队来的。女同学都参加扬麦，男同学有的开联合收割机，有的帮助农场盖食堂，他们都希望把自己的力量贡献给荒地，并且自己在劳动中得到锻炼。来自科米自治共和国的十九岁的姑娘库茨涅佐娃从另外一个打谷场上跑来，她是科米师范学院数理系二年级的学生。她对我们说，她非常关心中国的女青年，并仔细询问了中国青年学生的生活和学习情况，当我们临走时，她还在我们的笔记本上写下了她对中国青年的亲切关怀和祝愿。
    荒地，四年来已有了巨大的变化，它已完全改变了人们想像中的那付面貌，一座座现代化的机械化程度很高的国营农场已巩固地建立起来。荒地，一切在走向正轨，人们的生活非常安定而幸福。为了进一步发展荒地，他们已提出发展畜牧业的口号，以便在干旱年粮食欠收时能在畜牧业上得到补救。他们也要发展交通运输，以使成千成万吨的粮食能迅速地运往全国，支援各地建设。他们还要进一步培养技术干部和进一步改进荒地人民的福利事业。无疑的，几年以后，荒地的面目还会有巨大的变化，它会对自己国家的共产主义建设事业，发挥出更加巨大的作用。看，金黄色的麦粒多么丰满啊！苏联通讯
