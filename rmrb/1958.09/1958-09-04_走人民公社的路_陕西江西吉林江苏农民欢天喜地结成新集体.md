　　Following the Path of the People's Commune
    Farmers in Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Jilin, and Jiangsu Joyfully Form New Collectives
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 3rd: As of yesterday, thirty-seven counties and cities in Shaanxi Province have realized the people's commune system. In areas where people's communes have not yet been established, farmers are generally preparing to establish them, and it is expected that the province will basically realize people's communes by the end of September.
    Farmers in various parts of Shaanxi Province are very enthusiastic about setting up people's communes. In the past two days, more than 14,000 people in Huayin County reported their good news to the Huayin County Committee of the Communist Party of China. As early as July, the masses in Weiqu Township, Chang'an County, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao requesting the establishment of a collective farm. On August 13, after reading in the newspaper that Chairman Mao said that running people's communes was good during his inspection of work in Shandong, they reported the good news to the township Party committee that night with lanterns and torches. When the masses in Lintong County heard about running people's communes, they worked like tigers. Farmers across the county accumulated 8 billion catties of fertilizer in six days, 1.3 billion catties more than the entire month of July. Since August 16, when Majiawan Township in Gaoling County began to prepare for the establishment of a commune, it has established eight agricultural schools in eight days.
    In order to adapt to this situation, cherish the enthusiasm of the masses, and actively and systematically lead them, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a telephone conference, requiring all localities to take active action and run the people's communes well. The Party and government leading departments in many counties have established offices for the establishment of people's communes, headed by the secretary and several committee members, to specifically study and guide the work of establishing people's communes.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 2nd: The people in the old revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi Province are enthusiastically demanding to join the people's communes. Thirty-two counties and cities in the Gannan Administrative Region and the Ji'an Special Zone have all merged and transformed agricultural cooperatives into people's communes. Counties in Shangrao, Nanchang, Fuzhou, Jiujiang and other special zones have completed the first batch of pilot commune work.
    After the establishment of the people's communes, they immediately demonstrated greater superiority than agricultural cooperatives in the current production, and the potential of human and material resources has been further utilized. After the establishment of 32 people's communes in Suichuan County, the entire county's 390,000 mu of late rice was hoed twice in a few days, with an average of more than 2,500 dan of topdressing fertilizer applied per mu. Now red flags have been planted in every field, eliminating the original poorly growing third-class seedlings. After the merger of 273 agricultural cooperatives in Ruijin County into 49 people's communes, they successively revised and improved the originally set targets for autumn crop yields and industrial production, and stepped up field management activities such as weeding, cultivating, and topdressing in an effort to achieve an average yield of 1,000 catties of late rice per mu. The communes have adjusted their labor organization and transferred more than 7,000 people to build water conservancy projects day and night. Now three large-scale and hundreds of medium- and small-scale water conservancy projects have started construction throughout the county. Most of the factories run by the communes have begun preparations for construction. The Shazhou People's Commune already has more than 300 local fertilizer, granular fertilizer, and other factories in operation.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 3rd: More than 40 people's communes have been established in Jilin Province, and more than 50 are being established.
    The work of preparing for the establishment of people's communes in Jilin Province began in mid-July. In the upsurge of running industries in townships and cooperatives and carrying out technical and cultural revolutions, the vast numbers of cadres and farmers deeply felt that the scale of agricultural cooperatives was too small and too single-minded, and that human, material, and financial resources were not concentrated enough to meet the needs of developing production in a faster, better, and more economical way. After Chairman Mao praised the people's communes, the farmers resolutely demanded the establishment of people's communes. In just a few days, the people of four townships in Hailong County wrote more than 10,000 big-character posters, pledges, and applications requesting to join the people's communes. All members of the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative wrote a collective application overnight to join the people's commune.
    Agricultural cooperative members generally welcome or celebrate the establishment of people's communes by doing a good job in production. The Yongfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Jiaohe County completed the task of applying 100,000 catties of green manure per hectare in three days and nights. When the Shuguang People's Commune in Hailong County was established, it announced that it would build and repair more than 100 large and small reservoirs this year, and apply 100,000 catties of fertilizer per mu next year. As soon as the plan was announced, the members immediately started working day and night.
    The establishment of people's communes in Jilin Province is generally carried out in three steps. First, launch a production upsurge to powerfully promote current production through the work of establishing communes. Second, conduct preparations among Party and Youth League organizations and the masses, and on the basis of raising awareness, first build the framework of the commune, formulate production plans, and strengthen communist education. Third, fully mobilize the masses to conduct great airing of views, great contending, and great debates, and democratic consultation to solve specific economic problems.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd: In addition to some areas in Jiangsu Province having already established some people's communes, the movement to establish people's communes in most areas has a momentum of "one call, ten thousand responses."
    The people of Suining County are very enthusiastic about running communes. On August 23, more than 6,000 people in Zhangwei Township in the county gathered to demand to join the commune. They wrote more than 1,320 pledges, applications, and guarantees. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would welcome the people's commune with practical actions such as doing a good job in pest control, eliminating third-class seedlings, and accumulating fertilizer. After learning from the experience of Xinyang Special Zone in Henan Province in running people's communes, 19 agricultural cooperatives in Guizhuang Township, Taicang County, organized more than 10,000 people and successively demanded to run communes. On the evening of the 25th, representatives from each cooperative were selected, and despite the rain and darkness, they carried the pledges, beat gongs and drums, and rushed to the township Party committee to request approval to run communes.
    After the establishment of a number of people's communes in Huaiyin Special Zone, the attendance rate has greatly increased. These communes organized 3,000 people to bring their own straw mats to live in the fields to carry out deep plowing of the land, and also extracted more than 2,000 people to engage in water conservancy construction.

　　走人民公社的路
    陕西江西吉林江苏农民欢天喜地结成新集体
    据新华社西安3日电　陕西省到昨天为止，已经有三十七个县、市实现人民公社化。还没有建立人民公社的地方，农民正在普遍酝酿办公社，预计到9月底以前，全省就要基本上实现人民公社化。
    陕西省各地农民办人民公社的热情很高。华阴县在最近两天内给中共华阴县委报喜的即有一万四千多人。长安县韦曲乡的群众早在7月就给毛主席写了一封信，要求成立集体农庄。8月13日看到报纸上报道毛主席视察山东工作时说，办人民公社好，即在当天晚上拿着灯笼、火把向乡党委报喜。临潼县的群众听说办人民公社，就像猛虎一般干了起来。全县的农民在六天内就积了八十亿斤肥料，比7月份全月还多十三亿斤。高陵县马家弯乡从8月16日酝酿建立公社起，在八天内就办起了八处农业学校。
    为了适应这种形势，爱护群众的热情，积极地、有计划地加以领导，中共陕西省委最近开了电话会议，要求各地积极行动起来，办好人民公社。许多县的党、政领导部门成立了建立人民公社办公室，由书记和几个委员挂帅，专门研究和指导建立人民公社的工作。
    据新华社南昌2日电　江西省革命老根据地人民踊跃地要求加入人民公社。赣南行政区和吉安专区三十二个县、市，全部农业社分别合并转变成为人民公社。上饶、南昌、抚州、九江等专区各县都完成了第一批公社试办工作。
    人民公社建立以后，在当前生产中立即显示了比农业社更大的优越性，人力、物力的潜力得到了更大的发挥。遂川县三十二个人民公社建成以后，全县三十九万亩晚稻，几天内全部耘完了两道，平均每亩追肥二千五百多担。现在已丘丘插上了红旗，消灭了原来生长不好的三类苗。瑞金县二百七十三个农业社合并转为四十九个人民公社后，纷纷修改提高原订的秋季作物产量和工业生产指标，加紧进行力争晚稻平均亩产千斤的除草耘田、追肥的田间管理活动。各公社调整了劳动组织，抽调了七千多人日夜兴修水利，现在全县已有三座大型和几百座中、小型的水利工程开了工。社办的工厂大部分已开始筹建，沙洲人民公社已有三百多个土化肥、颗粒肥料等工厂投入生产。
    据新华社长春3日电　吉林省已经建立四十多个人民公社，正在建立的有五十多个。
    吉林省筹建人民公社的工作，是从7月中旬开始的。在乡社办工业和开展技术革命、文化革命的高潮中，广大干部和农民群众深深感觉到农业社规模太小，过于单一化，人力、物力、财力不够集中，不能适应多快好省地发展生产的需要。在毛主席赞扬人民公社好以后，农民群众就坚决要求建立人民公社。海龙县四个乡的人民群众，几天内就写出要求参加人民公社的大字报、决心书、申请书一万多件。幸福农业社全体社员连夜写了集体参加人民公社的申请书。
    农业社员们普遍以搞好生产来迎接或庆祝人民公社的成立。蛟河县永丰农业社三昼夜完成每公顷地压绿肥十万斤的任务。海龙县曙光人民公社成立时宣布今年新建和补修大小水库一百多座，明年每亩地施肥十万斤。计划一宣布，社员们立即不分昼夜地干起来。
    吉林省建立人民公社大体是分三步走。首先，是发动生产高潮，使建社工作有力地推动当前的生产。其次，在党、团组织和群众中进行酝酿，在提高认识的基础上，先搭起公社的架子，制订生产规划，加强共产主义教育。第三，是充分发动群众大鸣大放大辩论和民主协商，解决具体经济问题。
    据新华社南京3日电　江苏省一部分地区已经建立起一些人民公社外，大部分地区建立人民公社的运动有“登高一呼、万民响应”之势。
    睢宁县人民要求办公社的情绪非常高。8月23日，这个县张圩乡六千多人集会，要求参加公社，他们写了一千三百二十多张决心书、申请书、保证书。大家一致表示：要以搞好当前治虫、消灭三类苗和积肥等实际行动，来迎接人民公社。太仓县归庄乡十九个农业社，组织一万多人，学习了河南信阳专区办人民公社的经验后，纷纷要求办公社，25日晚各社选派了代表，不顾下雨天黑，抬了决心书，敲锣打鼓，赶到乡党委要求批准办公社。
    淮阴专区的各地建立一批人民公社后，出勤率大大提高。这些公社组织三千人自带草席住到田头进行深翻土地，另外还抽出两千多人搞水利建设。
