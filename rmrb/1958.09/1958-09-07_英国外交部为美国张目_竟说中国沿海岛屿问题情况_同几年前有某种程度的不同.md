Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from London: A spokesman for the British Foreign Office made a statement on the 5th, defending the policy of U.S. imperialism to expand the scope of its aggression and carry out war provocations in the Taiwan Straits area. He said that the British government is "entirely like the U.S. government, worried about any attempt to forcibly make territorial changes."

The spokesman then stated that the British government's attitude towards the coastal islands has not changed since the statement was made in Parliament. British former Prime Minister Eden had stated in Parliament in February 1955 that Britain considered the coastal islands of China to belong to the Chinese mainland legally and geographically, but the spokesman quickly added, "Of course, we have a new situation, which is to some extent different from the situation a few years ago."

When referring to the Chinese government's declaration regarding the determination of the breadth of its territorial sea as twelve nautical miles, the spokesman, disregarding the fact that all countries have the right to determine the scope of their territorial seas, unreasonably stated that "the British government does not recognize territorial seas beyond three miles."

　　英国外交部为美国张目
    竟说中国沿海岛屿问题情况
    同几年前有某种程度的不同
    新华社6日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人5日发表谈话，为美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区扩大侵略范围、进行战争挑衅的政策辩护。他说，英国政府“完全同美国政府一样，担心用武力硬行作出领土改变的任何企图”。
    这个发言人接着表示，英国政府对沿海岛屿的态度自从在议会里发表声明以来并没有改变过。英国前首相艾登在1955年2月间曾经在议会里声明，英国认为中国沿海岛屿在法律上和地理上都是属于中国大陆的，但是这个发言人又连忙说，“当然，我们有了一种新情况，这种情况同几年以前的情况有某种程度的不同。”
    发言人在谈到中国政府关于确定领海宽度为十二浬的声明时，不顾各国有权确定本国领海范围的事实，无理地表示“英国政府不承认三浬以上的领海。”
