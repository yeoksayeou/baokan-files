Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 26th: Fierlinger, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and Chairman of the National Assembly, said to a reporter from the Czechoslovak News Agency on the 26th that we believe that threatening the interests of the People's China is like threatening the interests of Czechoslovakia.

Fierlinger emphasized that Taiwan and the coastal islands of China rightfully belong to the People's China. The United States' occupation of these islands constitutes interference in China's internal affairs.

Fierlinger said that the People's China is making a great leap forward in building a socialist economy, and no objective politician would doubt that no force can shake the current Chinese people's regime. He also said that the successful development of science and technology in China has greatly strengthened China's national defense forces.

    中捷人民心连心
    费林格主席谴责美国干涉我国内政
    新华社布拉格26日电  捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治局委员、国民议会主席费林格26日向捷克斯洛伐克通讯社记者发表谈话说，我们认为，威胁人民中国的利益就如同威胁捷克斯洛伐克的利益一样。
    费林格强调指出，台湾和中国沿海岛屿是合法地属于人民中国的。美国统治着这些岛屿，这就构成对中国内政的干涉行为。
    费林格说，人民中国在建设社会主义经济中正在大跃进，任何客观的政治家都不会怀疑：没有任何力量能够动摇现在的中国人民政权。他还说，中国科学技术的顺利发展，也大大加强了中国的国防力量。
