Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Capital Organs Militia Division held its founding meeting today. More than 3,600 militiamen from central and Beijing municipal organs, each full of vigor, held their guns tightly. They shouted: "We must study diligently and practice hard, and learn military skills well!" "We must liberate Jinmen and Matsu, and we must liberate Taiwan!"

Qi Yanming, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council and Political Commissar of the Capital Organs Militia Division, congratulated the establishment of the Capital Organs Militia Division on behalf of the State Council. He said that in the future, all workers, peasants, and laborers must become laborers and producers, red intellectuals who combine theory with practice, and soldiers who defend the motherland with guns. All our cadres must demand of ourselves and transform ourselves according to this standard. When there is no foreign enemy invasion, we will advance towards nature; if the enemy dares to attack us, then we will advance to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the enemy.

Qi Yanming then announced the list of commanders of the Capital Organs Militia Division's divisions and regiments, and presented the division flag.

After Guo Bingkun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Commander of the Capital Organs Militia Division, issued an order to strengthen military training, all the militiamen held a solemn oath-taking ceremony.

At the meeting, Senior Colonel Xie Guoyi, representative of the People's Liberation Army garrisoned in Beijing, and a representative of the militia also spoke.

    首都机关民兵师成立
    新华社17日讯　首都机关民兵师今天举行成立大会。三千六百多个中央和北京市机关的民兵，人人精神抖擞，紧握枪枝。他们高呼：“我们要勤学苦练，学好军事技术！”“我们一定要解放金门、马祖，定要解放台湾！”
    国务院副秘书长、首都机关民兵师政治委员齐燕铭代表国务院祝贺首都机关民兵师的成立。他说，将来所有的工人农民劳动者都要成为既是劳动生产者，又是理论与实践联系的红色知识分子，同时又是拿枪杆保卫祖国的战士。我们全体机关干部一定要按这个标准要求自己，改造自己。在没有外来敌人侵袭的时候，我们向自然进军；如果敌人敢于向我们进攻，那我们就为坚决、彻底、干净、全部消灭敌人而进军。
    齐燕铭接着宣布首都机关民兵师的师、团指挥员任命名单，并且授了师旗。
    在内务部副部长、首都机关民兵师师长郭炳坤下达了加强军事训练的命令以后，全体民兵举行了庄严的宣誓。
    会上，中国人民解放军驻京部队代表谢国仪大校和民兵代表也讲了话。
