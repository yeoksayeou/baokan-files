Two Poems (Ci)
　Wei Chuantong

    Waves Wash the Sand

    The U.S. imperialists are villains, deliberately provoking and invading our territorial waters, occupying Taiwan and Penghu. Ignoring condemnations, their crimes are boundless, destroying peace.

    The old road of Tojo is still fresh in memory. The people's army has an iron broom that is hard. If they don't rein in and turn back quickly, they are digging their own graves.

    Pure Serene Music

    American pirates disregard our warnings. They confuse right and wrong and howl, their crimes will be settled and they will not escape.

    The Chiang bandit sells himself into servitude, his days are numbered and he is destitute. Recapturing Jinmen, Matsu, Taiwan and Penghu, our will is absolutely unshakable!

    词二首
  　魏传统
    浪淘沙
    美帝是恶棍，蓄意挑衅，侵我领海据台澎。不顾谴责弥天罪，破坏和平。
    东条旧时路，记忆犹新，人民军队铁帚硬。如不勒马快回头，自找墓门。
    清平乐
    美国海盗，无视我警告。混淆是非发嗥叫，罪行清算难逃。
    蒋贼卖身投靠，日暮途穷潦倒。收复金马台澎，意志绝不动摇！
