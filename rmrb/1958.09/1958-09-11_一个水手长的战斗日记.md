A Petty Officer's Combat Diary
    Li Yiwen
    × Month × Day
    Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has become even more frantic. American-made Chiang planes are constantly harassing coastal areas, continuously transporting troops to Kinmen, shelling coastal villages and towns, destroying the production of fishermen and boatmen, and committing all kinds of atrocities such as looting, arson, and murder. Whenever comrades talk about these enemy atrocities, they are filled with indignation and have submitted letters of determination to the Party. All the comrades in our boat have also written letters of determination to the Party, requesting the leadership to give us the task of fiercely attacking those enemy ships reinforcing Kinmen.
    It was already 9 p.m. After a day's labor, I and many comrades were taking a bath preparing to go to bed when suddenly the sound of a motor came from afar on the road. Soon an empty car arrived, and the commander immediately got in and left. It was already so late, there must be an emergency, I thought to myself. "There's a combat mission," said gunner Lao Zhang, who was standing next to me, looking at me. Before I could answer, torpedo man Xiao Li exclaimed: "Right! There must be a combat mission, otherwise why would the commander go to the headquarters at night?" Everyone had the same thought.
    The electric bell kept ringing. Although it was time for bed, most comrades were not asleep, and those who were lying down were not asleep either, as if they were all waiting for something!
    Sure enough, the Chief of Staff arrived shortly and ordered everyone to assemble. He briefly conveyed the order saying: "Chiang Kai-shek is again transporting troops to Kinmen. Our mission, in coordination with friendly forces, is to resolutely annihilate these robbers from the sea! Order all departments to be ready to go at any time."
    The comrades did not rest, and raced against time all night....

    × Month × Day
    Today I went to Keli to get spare equipment. Passing by the torpedo repair shop, I went to see Lao Wang and the others. I saw them working intensely. To ensure that the torpedoes were 100% normal, they had been working continuously for days and nights, and their eyes were already red. Even so, he did not complain about the difficulties, and jokingly said to me: "We've done our part, and when you deliver it, you must invite the enemy to a big meal, but they won't have to eat anymore from then on!" I also laughed and said, "Right! We will definitely deliver it and make sure the enemy eats the dishes you made, and guarantee they are satisfied."

    × Month × Day
    The weather is very good today, the sea is as calm as a mirror.
    The order came down, to finish eating before ×× hours, and at × hour × minute the order to prepare for battle and navigation. The comrades quickly took their combat positions and made a final check. I checked the control system, smokescreen, etc., and reported to the captain that everything was in good order.
    "Start the main engine," the captain gave the order, and the rumbling sound shook the hills.
    The command boat ordered to leave the mooring point, forming a column in order, heading ×× degrees, and advancing at ×× revolutions. Immediately, the bow of the boat stirred up white waves.
    The torpedo boat shot out of the bay like an arrow.
    The enemy ×× island opened fire on us. At this time, our elder brother artillery comrades immediately retaliated with fierce artillery fire. The enemy island was immediately shrouded in smoke. The enemy artillery stopped firing, and we could see it clearly and cheered: "Well done! Excellent!" If we weren't in combat, everyone would really jump for joy.
    The victory of the artillery elder brothers boosted our combat confidence. "Gunner Lao Zhang guarantees to complete the mission and challenges the machinist," torpedo man Xiao Li reported to me. I immediately reported to the captain and conveyed the message to the machinist. The machinist replied loudly: "Resolutely accept the challenge."

    "Two enemy guard ships on the port side are approaching our direction, distance ×× chains," the radar operator reported to the captain. We continued to charge forward without paying attention to these two enemy ships. The cowardly enemies turned to the right and fled.
    "Attack target detected at a distance of ×× chains on ×× heading," the radar operator reported again. At the same time, the command boat ordered ×× team to attack target number one, and ×× team to attack target number two, immediately deploy. The captain ordered me again to strengthen lookout.
    At this time, the sky gradually cleared up, and our teams turned to the left. ×× team quickly disappeared on the left side.

    "Target detected in ×× direction," I reported to the captain after discovering it with binoculars. The captain ordered to continue observation.
    The torpedo boat quickly approached the enemy ship. The target became larger and larger and could be seen with the naked eye, like a clumsy cow running away.
    The enemy ship opened fire on me, and shells whizzed over our heads. Lao Zhang immediately returned the compliment, hitting very accurately. The enemy artillery weakened and began firing aimlessly.

    At this time, we quickly passed through the fire net, approaching, approaching, and approaching again.
    "Ready—fire!" Swish, swish, swish, the torpedoes shot towards the enemy ship like dragons. "Boom!" "Boom!" The enemy ship was immediately surrounded by a water column mixed with fire and smoke.
    "The enemy ship is sinking!" Xiao Li reported to me. I immediately reported to the captain, and the comrades excitedly spread the news of victory.
    At this time, the enemy's guard ships were very lively, firing wildly, and the sea surface was illuminated red by tracer bullets, but we had already returned victoriously.

    一个水手长的战斗日记
    李以文
    ×月×日
    最近一个时期以来，蒋介石集团更加疯狂了，美制蒋机不断向沿海地区进行骚扰，并不断地向金门运兵，炮击沿海村镇，破坏渔民船民的生产，掠夺烧杀无恶不作。同志们一谈起敌人的这些暴行都非常愤恨，纷纷向党提出了决心书，我们艇全体同志也向党写了决心书，要求上级给任务，狠狠打击那些向金门增兵的敌舰。
    已经是夜九点了。经过白天的劳动，我和很多同志正在洗澡准备就寝，突然公路远处传来了马达声，很快一辆空车来了，首长立刻坐车走了。已经这样晚了，一定有紧急事情，我自己这样想。“有战斗任务”，站在旁边的炮手老张望着我说。我还没有来得及回答，鱼雷手小李却叫起来了：“对！一定有战斗任务，要不首长为什么连夜就到指挥部去呢？”大家不约而同地都有了这样想法。
    电铃不断地响。虽然早该就寝了，但大部分同志没有睡，躺下的也没有睡着，好像都在等待什么！
    果然不大会参谋长来了，命令全体集合。简单地传达命令说：“蒋介石又往金门运兵，我们的任务是在友邻部队的配合下，坚决地消灭这些从海上来的强盗！命令各部门准备就绪，随时准备出击。”
    同志们没有休息，连夜与时间展开了赛跑……。
    ×月×日
    今天到科里去拿备用器材，路过鱼雷检修所，顺便去看老王他们。只见他们正紧张地工作着，他们为了保证鱼雷能百分之百的正常，已经连续工作几天几夜了，眼睛已经红了。虽然这样，但他没有叫困难，而且还有趣的对我说：“我们做好了，等你们送上去，要请敌人大大地会一次餐，不过从今以后再也甭吃饭了！”我也笑着说：“对！我们一定送去，把你们做的菜一定请敌人吃上，并且保证他们吃得满意。”
    ×月×日
    今天天气很好，海面平静如镜。
    命令下来了，××时以前要吃饭完毕，到×时×分命令备战备航，同志们迅速地就了战位，作最后一次检查，我将操纵系统，烟幕等作了检查，向艇长报告一切良好。
    “启动主机”，艇长下达了命令，隆隆的声音震动了山岗。
    指挥艇命令离开停泊点，按秩序成一列纵队，航向××度，以××转速度前进。立刻艇首掀起了白色浪花。
    鱼雷快艇像箭一样地射出了海湾。
    敌××岛向我们开火，这时我们的老大哥炮兵同志立即以猛烈炮火还击，敌岛立刻就被硝烟所弥漫，敌炮再也不响了，我们看得很清楚，同声欢呼打得好！太妙了！要不是在战斗中，大伙真的会跳起来。
    炮兵老大哥的胜利鼓舞了我们的战斗信心，“炮手老张保证完成任务，并向轮机挑战”，鱼雷手小李这样向我报告。我立即向艇长打报告，并向轮机传达，轮机响亮地回答：“坚决应战”。
    “左舷发现敌警卫舰艇两艘向我方向接近，距离××链”，雷达手向艇长报告。我们一直向前猛冲，没有理这两艘敌舰。熊包的敌人却向右转逃跑了。
    “距离××链××航向发现攻击目标”，雷达手再次报告。与此同时，指挥艇命令××队攻击一号目标，××队攻击二号目标，立即展开。艇长再次命令我加强了望。
    这时天色渐渐晴下来了，我们队各自向左转，××队很快在左侧消失。
    “××方向发现目标”，我用望远镜发现后向艇长报告。艇长命令继续观察。
    快艇迅速地向敌舰接近，目标越来越大，用肉眼可以看见了，像条笨牛在向前逃窜。
    敌舰向我开火了，炮弹嗖嗖地从头上飞过。老张立即给他个回敬，打得很准。敌炮弱了，变成无目标地乱放。
    这时以快速冲过火网，接近，接近，再接近，
    “预备——放”，刷刷刷，鱼雷像龙一样射向敌舰。“轰！”“轰！”敌舰立刻被火烟混合的水柱所包围。
    “敌舰下沉了！”小李向我报告，我立即报告艇长，同志们兴奋地传着胜利的消息。
    这时候敌人的警卫舰艇可热闹了，乒乒乓乓地乱打一气，海面上被曳光弹照得通红，可是我们早就已经胜利返航了。
