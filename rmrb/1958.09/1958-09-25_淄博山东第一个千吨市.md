Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 24th: After a week of full preparation, the 200,000-strong iron and steel army in Zibo City, Shandong Province, created the first "1,000-ton city" for daily pig iron production in Shandong Province on the 22nd. On this day, the city produced a total of 1,076 tons of pig iron and an additional 1,656 tons of sintered iron.

Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, led a team to inspect iron and steel production in Zibo City on the 14th. The Zibo Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party resolved to mobilize the entire party and all the people, fighting for ten days, and made separate arrangements for both the front lines and the rear areas of iron and steel production. Combat headquarters were established for all furnace groups and iron smelting furnaces. In terms of logistical support, the city organized 170 trucks and more than 7,000 horse-drawn carts, as well as wheelbarrows and handcarts, to transport "grain and rations" for steel day and night, ensuring the supply of ore and coke. More than 70 engineers, technicians, and local experts in the city were also organized, rushing to various iron smelting positions to operate alongside workers, impart technology, and solve key problems, ensuring the normal production of various iron smelting furnaces.

In the Great Leap Forward in Steel in Zibo City, various indigenous furnaces displayed their great power. Among the 8,214 various iron smelting furnaces put into production in the city, 8,079 were large kilns, indigenous blast furnaces, pig snout furnaces, and crucible furnaces. The Boshan Ceramics Factory fully utilized its large kilns for firing ceramics to smelt iron, releasing a high-yield "satellite" with a daily output of 144.26 tons on the 22nd.

    淄博山东第一个千吨市
    新华社济南24日电  山东省淄博市二十万钢铁大军经过一周的充分准备，在22日创造山东省第一个日产生铁“千吨市”。这一天，全市共生产生铁一千零七十六吨，外产烧结铁等一千六百五十六吨。
    中共山东省委第一书记舒同14日曾率领钢铁生产检查组到淄博市检查工作。中共淄博市委决心全党发动、全民动员，奋战十日，对钢铁生产的前线和后方都分头作了部署。所有的炉群和炼铁炉都成立了战斗指挥部。在后勤供应方面，全市组织了一百七十辆汽车，七千多辆马车。地排车、小推车，日夜为钢铁运输“粮饷”，保证了矿石、焦炭的供应。全市七十多名工程技术人员和土专家也组织了起来，奔赴各炼铁阵地同工人一起操作，传授技术，解决关键问题，保证各种炼铁炉正常生产。
    淄博市在大战钢铁中，各种土炉大显神通。全市投入生产的八千二百一十四座各种炼铁炉中，大窑、土高炉、猪嘴炉，坩埚炉就有八千零七十九座。博山陶瓷厂由于充分利用了烧陶瓷的大窑炼铁，22日就放出了日产一四四点二六吨的高产“卫星”。
