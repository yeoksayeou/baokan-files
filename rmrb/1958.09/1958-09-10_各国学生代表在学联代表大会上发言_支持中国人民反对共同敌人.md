Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: The Fifth Congress of the International Union of Students concluded its discussion of the first agenda item at 6:30 this morning after four days of plenary speeches. Hu Qili, head of the Chinese student delegation, solemnly declared in his speech entitled "Chinese Students are Full of Confidence in the Cause of Peace and Justice for Mankind" that Chinese students, together with the Chinese people, will fight to the end to liberate China's territory of Taiwan.

He said: Chinese students fully support the solemn statement issued by our Premier Zhou Enlai on September 6. Our students are prepared to respond to the provocations of U.S. imperialism with redoubled blows. As long as U.S. imperialism does not cease its hostile policy towards China, our struggle will not cease for a single day.

From midnight to six o'clock, student representatives from Poland, the United Arab Republic, Central and East Africa, and Lebanon, who spoke at the conference, unanimously and strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for interfering in China's internal affairs and expressed their full support for the just struggle of the Chinese people. The Polish representative said that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and we firmly support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan. The representative of Central and East Africa said that in the struggle against our common enemy—U.S. imperialism—the Chinese people are our brothers. The Chinese people's struggle is our struggle, the Chinese people's victory is our victory, and if the Chinese people are attacked, our people will stand with the Chinese people and fight side by side. Representatives and observers from Libya, Mongolia, South Africa, Iraq, and Scotland also spoke at the conference this morning.

After the speeches of representatives from various countries, the President of the International Union of Students, Balikón, made a brief summary. He pointed out that the discussions at this conference have proven that it is entirely possible for student organizations from various countries around the world to further expand their friendship and cooperation on the basis of defending world peace and opposing imperialism and colonialism. This afternoon, representatives and observers from various countries began group discussions.
