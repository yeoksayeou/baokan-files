　　Pigeon Pea Cultivation is Easy and Widely Useful
　　The Shenxi Cooperative in Lanshan County, Hunan Province, planted twenty pigeon pea trees (also known as wood bean, tree bean, bean curd) on barren, dry red and yellow soil on July 24. Over the past seventy-plus days, the average tree height has reached 108 centimeters, with the tallest reaching 152 centimeters, and a crown width of 113 centimeters, with 20 branches. This is more than three times higher than those previously planted in fertile soil in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Rucheng in southern Hunan.

　　This tree is native to India and bears beans in the same year it is planted. On average, each tree can produce one or two kilograms of beans, and after three years can produce more than 50 kilograms, which is much higher than the yield of soybeans.

　　The beans can be used to extract oil, grind into tofu, make bean cakes and bean sauce, sprout bean sprouts, or be stir-fried or boiled. The branches, leaves, stalks, and pods can be dried, crushed, and used as good feed for pigs. The roots can be used as medicine to reduce throat swelling. Therefore, it is a very good oil, feed, fertilizer, and medicinal tree species.

　　豆子树栽培容易用途广
    湖南省蓝山县神溪社，7月24日在瘠薄干燥的红黄壤上试播二十颗豆子树（又名木豆、树豆、豆蓉），七十多天来，平均树高一百零八公分，最高的一株已有一百五十二公分，冠幅一百一十三公分，分枝二十个。较过去浙江、江西等省及湘南汝城等地栽在肥沃土壤上的要高三倍以上。
    这种树原产印度，种植当年就结豆子，平均每株能产一、二公斤，三年后能结五十公斤以上，较黄豆产量高得多。
    豆子可榨油，磨豆腐，作豆糕、豆酱、发豆芽，也可炒食或煮吃。枝叶秸秆和豆荚晒干舂碎后，是猪的好饲料。根做药，能消喉肿。因此它是很好的油料、饲料、肥料、药用树种。
