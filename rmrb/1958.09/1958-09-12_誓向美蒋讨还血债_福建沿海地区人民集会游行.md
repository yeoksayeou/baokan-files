Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 11th: The people in the coastal areas and coastal islands of Fujian Province are vowing to avenge their blood debt against the US-Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The fishermen of Huangqi Peninsula and Meihua, Dahe, Jiangtian, Tantou, and other coastal areas facing the Matsu Island occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, held rallies on the beaches after hearing Premier Zhou's statement broadcast. At the rally held by more than 15,000 fishermen in Huangqi Peninsula, the fishermen angrily denounced the towering crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits over the years in dragging away more than 100 fishing boats, capturing more than 100 young and middle-aged fishermen, and destroying more than 70 civilian houses and killing and wounding more than 10 fishermen with artillery fire in the coastal areas. They expressed that they would take practical actions to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinmen and Matsu, liberating Taiwan, and demand the Chiang Kai-shek bandits repay their blood debt. Cai Xiandi, an elderly fisherman in his sixties from the Meihua People's Commune, said passionately: "To liberate Jinmen and Matsu, to liberate Taiwan, I must be an old boatman, sending the People's Liberation Army to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and avenge the fishermen who have been harmed."

In the past few days, despite the continuous and barbaric shelling of Da Deng Island and Xiao Deng Island by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched in Jinmen, the people on these two islands still held rallies in defiance of the artillery fire. Angered people resolutely stated that they would turn their anger into strength and demand that the US-Chiang Kai-shek clique repay their blood debt. The fishermen and militiamen on Nanri Island are maintaining vigilance a hundredfold, adhering to production during the day and strengthening sentry duty at night. More than 300 women on the island have also taken up arms to assist the troops in defending the coast day and night. Of the 140,000 people on Pingtan Island, 110,000 have participated in demonstrations and protest rallies. Even on the small Ku Islet and Xiao Xiang Island, with only a few dozen households, they held anti-American demonstrations. People in the coastal areas of Liancheng Peninsula, Xiao Zuo Peninsula, and Chongwu Peninsula in Huian County also generally held rallies and demonstrations. The militiamen of Liancheng Peninsula, who have repelled the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' sneak attacks dozens of times in recent years, swore: "If US imperialism dares to prevent us from liberating our sacred territory, we will crush it into pieces under our iron fists and bury it in the seabed!"

    誓向美蒋讨还血债
    福建沿海地区人民集会游行
    新华社福州11日电　福建省沿海地区和沿海岛屿人民誓向美蒋讨还血债。
    同蒋贼军盘据的马祖岛相对的黄岐半岛和梅花、大鹤、江田、潭头等沿海地区的渔民们，在听到周总理声明的广播以后，纷纷在海滩上集会。在黄岐半岛一万五千多渔民举行的集会上，渔民们愤怒地控诉几年来蒋贼军在沿海一带拖去一百多艘渔船，抓去一百多个青壮年渔民，并用炮火击毁七十多间民房和打死打伤十多个渔民的滔天罪行，纷纷表示要以实际行动支援人民解放军解放金门、马祖，解放台湾，向蒋贼军讨还血债。梅花人民公社六十多岁的老渔民蔡显俤激昂地说：“解放金门、马祖，解放台湾，我一定要当一名老?，把解放军送过去消灭蒋贼军，为受害的渔民报仇雪恨”。
    这几天，尽管盘踞金门的蒋贼军不断向大嶝岛和小嶝岛进行野蛮的炮击，这两个岛上的人民仍然冒着炮火举行了集会，被激怒了的人们坚决表示要把愤怒变成力量，向美蒋讨还血债。南日岛上的渔民和民兵，个个百倍警惕，白天坚持生产，晚上加强防哨。岛上的三百多个妇女也拿起武器日夜协助部队守卫海防。平潭岛上十四万人口，已有十一万人参加了示威游行和抗议集会。小小的苦屿和小庠岛上都只有几十户人家，他们也举行了反美示威游行。惠安县莲城半岛、小岞半岛和崇武半岛等沿海地区的人民也普遍举行了集会和游行示威。几年来曾几十次击退蒋贼军偷渡骚扰的莲城半岛民兵宣誓说：“美帝国主义胆敢阻止我们解放自己的神圣领土，就叫它在我们铁掌下粉尸碎骨，葬身海底！”
