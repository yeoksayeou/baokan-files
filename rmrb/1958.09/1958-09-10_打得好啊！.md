Our torpedo boat unit of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front is made up of young people. The first time we fought against the Chiang bandits' ships, we hit a "Zhong" class bandit ship. We felt like we hadn't even used our full strength yet, and we were ready to hit a few more.

In July of this year, the American and British imperialists launched an armed invasion of the Middle East, which made us extremely angry. Later, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's army constantly harassed the mainland, shelling coastal villages and islands. We were filled with irrepressible anger and demanded that the traitor be severely punished.

On August 23, we began to punish Chiang's bandit army. Powerful coastal artillery and land artillery units launched a fierce bombardment of the enemy troops defending Kinmen Island. Shells rained down on the lifeless Kinmen Island. The Chiang bandit troops, who had been like mad dogs not long ago, tucked their tails, shrunk their heads, and didn't dare to utter a sound.

On the morning of the 24th, news of the victory of the artillery battle came from the command post. In addition to killing a large number of enemy troops on the island, one of the two "Zhong" class enemy ships reinforcing Kinmen had been damaged.

With the victory news came orders. The commander conveyed the orders from higher authorities to us, telling us to intercept the enemy ships and bury them in the sea.

Before long, the radar on the boat was set up, and telegrams were continuously sent to the commander, with the situation changing every moment. Although this was my first time fighting, I could tell that something was up.

My thoughts suddenly returned to my torpedoes. At this moment, I truly felt that my mission was indeed not light. Don't underestimate these two non-breathing torpedoes, sending enemy ships to the sea is essential to use them. Originally, torpedo soldiers and torpedoes have feelings, and now I love them even more. I quickly squatted down and carefully checked them again. I stroked its dark body, and in an instant, I felt as if it could understand my words, and I couldn't help but mutter to it in a low voice: "You must be obedient, don't be naughty and malfunction when the time comes, I will ask for credit for you if you sink the enemy ship..."

At 5:30 in the afternoon, the news that the enemy ships were fleeing from Kinmen reached the boat. Immediately afterwards, at the commander's command, our boat team, like arrows released from a bow, headed in the direction of the fleeing enemy ships. I looked around, the speedboats closely followed each other, and the white waves churned up on both sides of the boats connected together, truly like a silver-grey dragon, spreading its silver-white wings, flying on the sea. I was extremely happy and wanted to shout a loud "Good!"

By the time our boat team approached the enemy ships, it was already dark, and there was no light on the dim shadow clock (an instrument indicating light intensity), which was even more favorable to our attack. The boat captain gave the order to prepare for the launch of two torpedoes. I quickly repeated the captain's order, ran to the captain to get the fuse, put it into the tube, and forcefully closed the "bolt cover", but it was not closed tightly, and the "turning handle" could not be turned, so the torpedo could not be launched.

At this time, the boat was rushing towards the enemy ship like a flying arrow, and the distance was rapidly shortening. In the blink of an eye, I decided to go to the captain to replace the fuse. However, the "bolt cover" was not closed tightly, and I couldn't leave. If I left, and the boat vibrated, the fuse might slip into the sea. I was in trouble, when I saw Section Chief Liu from the fleet who came to our boat to help. At this time, I didn't care about the etiquette between superiors and subordinates, and I grabbed him and asked him to help me hold down the "bolt cover". He understood what I meant, and naturally was not angry with me, and quickly held down the "bolt cover". I turned around and ran to the captain to get a new fuse, nodded to Section Chief Liu, and expressed my gratitude.

My heart was as bright as a mirror, and I didn't panic at all. I eliminated the malfunction and prepared the torpedo for launch. At this time, the enemy ship was already close at hand, and the torpedo was about to be launched soon.

Our captain was truly calm, in order to shoot accurately, closer, closer, he shouted "Ready!" three times before shouting "Fire!" Then, the torpedo jumped into the sea and flew towards the enemy ship. As soon as our boat turned, the torpedo hit. With a loud bang, a water column more than ten feet high and a cloud of thick smoke rose below the enemy ship's bridge. Two large holes like gates appeared in the hull. Seawater poured in, and the enemy ship went to report to the Dragon King.

At this time, the whole boat cheered, and some shook hands with each other to congratulate each other according to custom. Because I was happy after troubleshooting, I suddenly jumped up from the deck. In an instant, I felt that cheering and clapping were not enough, and I couldn't help but raise my fist and shout, "That was a good hit!"

### 打得好啊！

　　打得好啊！
　　中国人民解放军福建前线某部鱼雷手　胡庆新
    我们这支快艇部队都是年青人。第一次和蒋贼舰较量，就打中了“中字号”贼舰。我们觉得还没有使出劲来，还准备多打它几只呢。
    今年7月份，美英帝国主义武装侵略中东，我们生气极了。后来卖国贼蒋介石的军队不断骚扰大陆，炮击沿海村镇和岛屿，我们真是愤怒得止不住了，纷纷要求狠狠地惩罚卖国贼。
    8月23日，我们开始惩罚蒋贼军了，强大的海岸炮和陆炮部队，向金门岛的守敌展开了猛烈的轰击，炮弹像雨点似的射向死沉沉的金门岛。从我们的待机点望过去，金门岛变成了一片烟火海，不久以前还像疯狗一样的蒋贼军，夹起尾巴，缩起脑袋，一声也不敢吭了。
    24日的早晨，从指挥所传来炮战的胜利消息，除了大量杀伤岛上的守敌以外，增援金门的两艘“中字号”敌舰，有一艘已经被击伤。
    胜利消息来了，命令也来了，指挥员对我们传达了上级命令，叫我们截击敌舰，把敌人埋葬在大海里。
    不一会，艇上的雷达树起来了，一个接一个的电报不断送到指挥员手里，情况一会一个变化。我虽然是头一回打仗，也能看出是有门儿了。
    我的思想突然又回到我的鱼雷上来，这时候我才真正感到我的任务的确不轻。别看这两颗不会喘气的鱼雷，要送敌舰下海，却非它不可。本来鱼雷兵和鱼雷就是有感情的，这下我就更爱它了。我赶忙蹲下来，再仔细检查一遍。我抚摸着它那黑黝黝的身体，一霎那间，我仿佛觉得它能够听懂我的话，不由得小声对它叨念起来：“你可要听话啊，到时候别调皮出故障，打沉了敌舰我替你请功……”。
    下午五点三十分，敌舰从金门溃逃的消息，就传到了艇上。接着，指挥员一声令下，我们的艇队就像离弦的箭一样，照着敌舰逃跑的方向开去。我朝前后看看，快艇一个紧跟一个，艇两旁翻起的白浪花连接了起来，真像是一条银灰色的巨龙，展开它那银白色的翅膀，在海面上飞行。我高兴极了，真想大声叫一个“好！”
    当我们的艇队接近敌舰时，天已经黑了下来，昏暗影钟（指示光度的仪表）上没有一点光了，这样对我们的攻击更加有利。艇长下达了两管预备发射的命令。我急忙复诵了艇长的命令，跑到艇长那里领来讯管，朝管眼里一放，用力一关“关栓盖”，没有关紧，“转把”也转不过来，这样鱼雷是不能发射的。
    这时候，艇就像飞箭般地冲向敌舰，距离很快地缩短着。眨眼间，我决定到艇长那里去更换讯管。但是，“关栓盖”没有关紧，我离不开。假如我一走，艇一震动，讯管就可能溜到海里去。我正在为难，转眼看到了舰队来我艇帮助工作的刘科长，这时我也顾不得上下级的礼貌了，就一把把他拉过来，请他帮我按着“关栓盖”。他明白了我的意思，自然也没有生我的气，迅速地把“关栓盖”按住。我转身跑到艇长那里要来一个新的讯管，朝刘科长点了点头，表示了一下谢意。
    我心里像明镜一样的亮堂，一点也没有慌张。排除了故障，作好了鱼雷发射准备。这时敌舰已近在眼前，鱼雷很快就要发射了。
    我们的艇长才真叫沉着呢，他为了射击准确，靠近点，再靠近点，一连喊了三声“预备！”才喊出“放！”接着，鱼雷跳入海中，飞向敌舰。我们的艇刚一转向，鱼雷命中了。随着一声巨响，敌舰驾驶台下升起了丈多高的水柱和一团浓烟，舰体上出现了两个像大门一样的大洞，海水灌进去，敌舰去找龙王报到去了。
    这时全艇欢呼起来，有的按照习惯互相握手祝贺。我因为排除故障后，心里一阵高兴，我猛地从甲板上跳起来，霎那间我觉得欢呼和鼓掌都不够过瘾，忍不住高举起拳头，大叫了一声：“打得好啊！”
