    Leap Forward in the Northeast

　　Mass Literary and Art Movement in Shenyang
    Mao Dun

    There are nearly two hundred factories in Tiexi District of Shenyang. The momentum of mass literary and art activities unfolding here can be described using an idiom that has often appeared in newspapers and periodicals recently: "Ten thousand horses galloping."

    The population of the entire Tiexi District is approximately 400,000, of which more than 180,000 are workers. Now, mass literary and art activities are not only developing rapidly among the 180,000 workers but also spreading in the streets. In early June, when I was in Shenyang, I learned that the Tiexi District Committee was planning to establish street clubs as a base for carrying out street literary and art activities. I guess this proposal has probably been realized by now. But even in early June, the "Street Poetry Journal," which could be called the vanguard of street literary and art activities, had already published two issues in Tiexi District. The plan for street clubs (assuming one club is established for each street office) will universally involve urban street residents in literary and art activities, fully realizing the concept of literature and art run by all the people.

    As for factories, the literary creation network in Tiexi District has been established. Nearly six hundred literary creation groups have been established throughout the district, with a large team of nearly three thousand people. How do these creation groups operate? Take the creation group of the Bridge Factory as an example. The Bridge Factory has more than 1,800 workers. The creation group was formally established in March of this year, with forty participants. In more than two months, this group has created more than one hundred new works, including Pingju opera, spoken drama, living newspaper plays, crosstalk, poetry, etc. These works all serve production and central tasks. During the Double-Anti Movement, propaganda teams were everywhere in the factory. As soon as new people and new events appeared, they were immediately reflected in the form of storytelling and singing. Works of relatively high quality are published in the factory's internal publications. Putting politics in command, being small-scale and diverse—this is the fundamental reason why the mass literary and art activities of such a large scale in Tiexi District can serve production and be welcomed by the masses. And this is a manifestation of the District Committee's implementation of the General Line. Taking the Bridge Factory as an example, the factory originally had an amateur Pingju opera troupe, but for a long time, it was divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, and divorced from politics; this time, the direction was fundamentally reversed.

    Large factories all have internal publications, and literary works occupy a certain position in these publications. The "Second Machine Tool Plant News" and "Heavy Machinery Plant News" that I saw are like this. The publications of other factories are naturally the same. However, what is published in these publications is only a part, and even a small part, of the works that have already been created by the creation groups in each factory. The rest is published on wall newspapers. Another large part is published through singing, which is kuaiban (clapper talk), crosstalk, and even living newspaper plays. Among the literary and art forms that workers write and perform themselves, living newspaper plays are the most popular. This is because living newspaper plays have the following advantages: the story can be long or short, the number of performers can be large or small, and almost any content can be put in; with simple makeup, no sets or props are needed, and almost everyone can perform, without prior training. It is better than kuaiban and crosstalk in that it is more image-based.

    In order to uniformly lead mass cultural and artistic activities, Shenyang City established a mass cultural and artistic activities committee in June, including the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League. At the city and district levels, cultural centers serve as working bases. The district's tutoring publications will be published regularly; the Tiexi District's "Mass Writing," which published its first issue in late April of this year, will publish works recommended by various creation groups, with a target of five hundred articles this year. Better works will be published in provincial and municipal newspapers and periodicals.

    As for mass literary and art activities in rural areas, the Great Leap Forward can also be seen from the number of rural clubs in Liaoning Province: the number of clubs has increased sharply from 10,000 to 30,000. The Gao Kan Township cooperative has seven amateur theatrical troupes (each troupe with more than thirty people) and a choir of more than four hundred people. There are twenty-four basketball teams. Two theatrical troupes have won awards at performances. However, the population of the Gao Kan cooperative is only eight thousand. Comparing the population figure with the number of amateur theatrical troupes, choirs, and basketball teams, it can be seen that literary and art activities are widespread and active. I watched a small-scale literary and art performance by this cooperative. Seven or eight programs were performed in one hour, including Korean dance (the Gao Kan cooperative has more than sixty Korean households), errenzhuan, small chorus, instrumental ensemble, and crosstalk. In the instrumental ensemble, one person played the violin and one person played a Western-style moon lute. Just watching this small-scale performance proves that the scale and level of rural amateur literary and art activities cannot be estimated with old eyes. A considerable number of cadres from Shenyang City have been sent to the Gao Kan cooperative. There is no doubt that these dispatched cadres will play a huge role in the cooperative's cultural and technological revolutions. (End of full text)

### 群众文艺运动在沈阳
茅盾

    跃进中的东北
　　群众文艺运动在沈阳
    茅盾
    沈阳的铁西区有将近二百个工厂，群众性文艺活动在这里普遍展开的声势，可以用近来常在报刊上出现的一个成语来形容，这就是“万马奔腾”。
    铁西全区的人口约为四十多万，其中工人十八万多。现在，群众性的文艺活动不仅在十八万工人中间飞快开展，而且也在街道展开。6月初，我在沈阳时，知道铁西区委正打算开办街道俱乐部作为开展街道文艺活动的基地；我猜想这个拟议，现在大概已经实现。但即在6月初，可以称为街道文艺活动的尖兵的“街头诗刊”却已经在铁西区出了两期了。街道俱乐部（假定一个街道办事处设立一个俱乐部）的计划，将使得城市街道居民普遍卷入文艺活动，全面地实现了全民办文艺。
    就工厂而言，铁西区的文艺创作网已经建立起来了。全区已经建立的文艺创作小组将近六百个，队伍之大，将近三千人。这些创作小组怎样活动呢？试举桥梁厂的创作小组为例。桥梁厂有工人一千八百多，创作小组是今年3月间正式成立的，参加者四十人。两个多月内，这个小组已经创作了新作品百十多篇，有评剧、话剧、活报剧、相声、诗歌等等；这些作品都是为生产服务、为中心工作服务的。双反运动中，厂内到处有宣传队。新人新事一出现，立刻就用说唱形式来反映。质量比较高的作品在厂内刊物上发表。政治挂帅，小型多样，这是铁西区那样声势浩大的群众文艺活动之所以做到能为生产服务、受群众欢迎的根本原因。而这，又是区委贯彻执行总路线的表现。即以桥梁厂来说，该厂本来有个业余的评剧团，但是长久时期内脱离实际，脱离群众，脱离政治；这一次，根本扭转了方向。
    大工厂都有内部刊物，文艺作品在这些刊物上都占一定的地位。我看到的“二机床报”和“重机报”就是这样的。其他工厂的刊物自然也是这样。可是，这些刊物上登出来的，只是各厂的创作组已经创作出来的作品的一部分，而且还是小部分。其余一部分发表在壁报上。另外很大一部分是通过演唱的方式发表的，这就是快板、相声、乃至活报剧。在工人们自编自演的文艺品种中间，活报剧最为盛行。这是因为活报剧有这样几点好处：故事可长可短，演出者可多可少，而且几乎任何内容都可以装进去；只要简单化妆，可以不要布景和道具，而且几乎人人可演，不需要事先的训练。它强似快板和相声之处，即在于它更多些形象性。
    为了统一领导群众文化艺术活动，沈阳市在6月内新成立一个包含党、政、工、团四个方面的群众文化艺术活动委员会，市、区各一级，以文化馆作为工作据点。区的辅导刊物将经常定期出版；在本年4月下旬出了第一期的铁西区的“群众写作”将登载各创作小组推荐的作品，今年的目标是五百篇。更好的作品将在省市报纸、刊物上发表。
    至于农村的群众性的文艺活动，从辽宁省农村俱乐部的数目字也可以看出大跃进的情况：俱乐部从一万个骤增至三万个。高坎乡合作社有七个业余剧团（每团三十多人），有四百多人的合唱队。有篮球队二十四个。两个剧团在会演时得过奖。然而高坎合作社的人口不过八千而已，把人口的数字和业余剧团、合唱队、篮球队的数目一比较，就可以看出文艺活动的普遍和活跃。我看过这个合作社的一次小规模文艺表演，一小时内演出了七八个节目，有朝鲜族的舞蹈（高坎合作社有朝鲜族六十多户），有二人转，小合唱，器乐合奏，相声。器乐合奏中，有一人拉小提琴，一人弹西式月琴。仅仅看了这个小规模的表演，也就证明，不能用旧眼光来估量农村业余文艺活动的规模和水平。沈阳市下放到高坎合作社的干部为数不少，毫无疑问，这些下放干部对于社的文化革命和技术革命将发挥巨大作用。（全文完）
