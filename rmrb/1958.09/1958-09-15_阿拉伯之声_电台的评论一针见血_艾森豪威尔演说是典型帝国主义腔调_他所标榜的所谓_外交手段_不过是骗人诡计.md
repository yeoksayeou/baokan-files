Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 13th. Cairo's "Voice of the Arabs" radio station commented on the television speech delivered by Eisenhower on the 11th, on the evening of the 12th, saying that the most prominent sentence in this speech was that the People's China's liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands "is to eliminate all the positions of the free world in the Western Pacific region." The commentary said, we must thank him for frankly admitting the truth of imperialist policies to the world.

The commentary said that from this sentence we can see the viewpoint and special angle of imperialist countries on the territorial sovereignty of the people of all countries. The coastal islands and Taiwan of China are all Chinese territory. But the United States does not consider these at all. This explains to us the logic of "positions of strength", aggressive treaties, and base policies: even if such policies damage the freedom and territorial sovereignty of the people or divide unified countries, they will not hesitate.

The commentary said that this imperialist view is the foundation of all evils that violate the rights of the people and oppose the freedom and independence of the people, and it is also the foundation of the bankrupt Baghdad Pact and the "Eisenhower Doctrine". It is also the reason why the US and British troops occupied Lebanon and Jordan, and it is also the reason why the US and Britain conspired against the United Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq, as well as the Arab liberation movement. It is also the reason why the US and Britain are hostile to all liberation movements around the world, conspiring to subvert patriotic governments in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and opposing the people's revolution.

The commentary said that Eisenhower also said in his speech: "We believe that a way out can and should be found by diplomatic means." The commentary pointed out that while Eisenhower mentioned using "diplomatic means" as a way to resolve the tense situation in the Far East, he also wanted to paralyze these "diplomatic means." Because he even said that the United States would never participate in any arrangement that would harm the Chiang Kai-shek group.

The commentary said that the so-called "diplomatic means" of the West, as imperialism has made us accustomed to recognize, are empty talk, deception, and all kinds of tricks. When imperialists are forced to do so, or when they intend to use them to buy time, or deceive the people and free countries who are fighting, they adopt "diplomatic means." Our Arab homeland has fresh memories of the painful experience of dealing with the "diplomatic means" of the imperialists. We still remember how the imperialist countries ganged up to deal with the Suez Canal issue. When the glorious revolution broke out in Iraq, the United States and Britain did not treat this revolution through "diplomatic means," but with military build-ups, fleets, aggressive intentions, and the occupation of Lebanon and Jordan. When they saw that conspiracies and force were ineffective, they began to use "diplomatic means" to bargain on ending their occupation of Lebanon and Jordan. Today, we can see how the West's "diplomatic means" are handling the Middle East crisis, that is: setting up numerous obstacles on the road to implementing the United Nations resolutions, and inciting the imperialist agents in Lebanon and Jordan to insist that the US and British occupation forces continue to stay in these two Arab countries.

The commentary also pointed out that the reason why Eisenhower is now also talking about finding a "way out" through "diplomatic means" is because he is facing a major power, China. China has the open support of the Soviet Union, and world opinion is also on China's side. The United States realizes that the estimate that force can be used smoothly in resolving this crisis is very unreliable. Moreover, the United States' allies do not support the United States in this crisis. The commentary said, "Therefore, diplomatic means have become (the United States') savior from its predicament." The commentary said that if China were a weak country, and those powerful forces mentioned above were not on its side, then the United States would definitely think that what "can and should be found a way out" would definitely be force and not any "diplomatic means."

    “阿拉伯之声”电台的评论一针见血
    艾森豪威尔演说是典型帝国主义腔调
    他所标榜的所谓“外交手段”不过是骗人诡计
    新华社开罗13日电　开罗“阿拉伯之声电台”12日晚上就艾森豪威尔11日发表的电视演说发表评论说，这篇演说最突出的一句话是，人民中国解放台湾和沿海岛屿“是要消除自由世界在西太平洋地区的一切阵地”。评论说，我们要感谢他向全世界坦白地承认了帝国主义政策的真相。
    评论说，从这句话我们就可以看出帝国主义国家看待各国人民的领土主权的观点和特殊角度。中国沿海岛屿和台湾都是中国的领土。但是美国却毫不考虑这些。这就给我们说明了“实力地位”、侵略性条约和基地政策的逻辑：即使这种政策破坏人民的自由和领土主权或分裂统一的国家也在所不惜。
    评论说，这种帝国主义观点，就是侵犯人民权利、反对人民的自由和独立的一切罪恶的基础，也就是破产了的巴格达条约和“艾森豪威尔主义”的基础。它也是美英军队所以占领黎巴嫩和约旦的原因，也是美英两国对阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克共和国以及阿拉伯自由运动进行阴谋的原因，也是美英敌视世界各地一切解放运动，阴谋颠复亚非和拉丁美洲各个爱国政府并且反对人民革命的原因。
    评论说，艾森豪威尔在演说中还说：“我们认为，以外交手段，能够而且应该找到一个出路”。评论指出，艾森豪威尔一方面提到要使用“外交手段”作为解决远东紧张局势的途径，但是同时他又要使这种“外交手段”陷于瘫痪。因为他竟然又说，美国决不参与会损害蒋介石集团的任何安排。
    评论说，西方的所谓“外交手段”，正如帝国主义使我们已经习惯认识的，就是空谈、欺骗和花样百出的诡计。当帝国主义者，在不得已时或者他们打算用来争取时间、或欺骗斗争的人民和自由的国家时，他们就采用“外交手段”。我们阿拉伯祖国，在和帝国主义者打交道中对于他们的“外交手段”的痛苦经历，记忆犹新。我们还记得帝国主义国家曾经怎样群起对付苏伊士运河问题。美国和英国在伊拉克的光荣革命爆发之时，它们并没有通过“外交手段”对待这一革命，而是用军事集结，用舰队，用侵略意图，用占领黎巴嫩和约旦来对付。当它们看到阴谋和武力都归无效时，才开始采用“外交手段”在结束它们占领黎巴嫩和约旦一事上讨价还价。今天，我们可以看到西方的“外交手段”怎样处理中东危机，那就是：在执行联合国的决议的道路上设置重重障碍，怂恿黎巴嫩和约旦的帝国主义代理人们坚持要美英占领军继续留在这两个阿拉伯国家之内。
    评论还指出，艾森豪威尔现在所以也在谈通过“外交手段”来找“出路”，那是因为它面对的是一个大国，就是中国。中国有苏联的公开支持，世界舆论也站在中国一边。美国认识到，在解决这一危机中可以顺利使用武力的估计是非常不可靠的。而且美国的盟友在这一危机中也不支持美国。评论说，“因此，外交手段就成了（美国）摆脱窘境的救星。”评论说，假设中国是一个弱国，上述那些强大力量也没有站在它的一边，那么，美国一定认为，“能够而且应该找到一个出路”的必定是武力而不会是什么“外交手段”了。
