Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: Despite the resumption of the Sino-US talks, American imperialism is still continuing to expand its military threat and armed aggression against China. The US government has recently been actively dispatching massive armed forces to gather in the Taiwan area. According to Washington sources, the US Seventh Fleet has concentrated six aircraft carriers, two heavy cruisers, thirty-six destroyers, four submarines, and twenty amphibious landing craft in the Taiwan Strait and nearby areas, totaling 60,000 troops. The fighter jets and light bombers on the aircraft carriers can fly 600 sorties a day. US news agencies threatened that "the United States has concentrated the largest military force centered on atomic weapons in the Far East since World War II." Sources say that US Marine Corps and Air Force units stationed at Atsugi Air Force Base in Japan and Okinawa have been transferred to Taiwan in large numbers. US Navy and other Air Force units stationed in Japan are also prepared to quickly join the US military deployment along the South Korea, Okinawa, Taiwan, and Philippines line as soon as they receive orders. The spearhead of aggression is all pointing to the Chinese mainland. At the same time, a number of US intelligence officials and "military strategy and tactics experts on China" are rushing from the United States, Tokyo, Japan, and Okinawa to Taiwan to participate in plotting criminal actions to invade China.

The United States recently transferred the first batch of six F-100 jet fighters to Chiang Kai-shek's air force in order to increase the strength of the Chiang bandit air force to carry out treasonous war. US equipment and supplies to Chiang Kai-shek's navy and army have also increased recently. The US’s active troop increase in Taiwan and the strengthening of “military assistance” to the Chiang bandit army are happening at the same time as the attempt to play the "ceasefire" conspiracy, which more clearly exposes the hypocrisy of the US’s so-called hope to resolve the international dispute over Taiwan peacefully.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 19th dispatch: The US warship "USS Bon Homme Richard" passed through the Suez Canal yesterday to reinforce US aggression forces in the Far East.

It is a US Navy mobile supply ship carrying 11,000 tons of supplies.

### 一面鼓吹“停火”一面加紧玩火  美国继续扩大侵略阴谋

    一面鼓吹“停火”一面加紧玩火
    美国继续扩大侵略阴谋
    新华社19日讯　尽管中美会谈已经恢复，美帝国主义却仍在继续扩大对中国的军事威胁和武装侵略活动。美国政府最近积极调遣庞大的武装力量到台湾地区集结。据华盛顿消息，美国第七舰队在台湾海峡和附近地区集中了六艘航空母舰，两艘重巡洋舰，三十六艘驱逐舰，四艘潜水艇和二十艘两栖登陆艇，共有六万兵员。航空母舰上的歼击机和轻型轰炸机每天可以出动六百架次。美国通讯社恫吓说，“美国在远东集中了第二次世界大战以来规模最大的一支以原子武器为核心的军事力量”，有消息说，驻在日本厚木空军基地和冲绳基地的美国海军陆战队和空军部队已大批调往台湾。驻在日本的美国海军和其他空军部队，也准备一接命令即迅速参加沿着南朝鲜、冲绳、台湾、菲律宾一线的美军部署，侵略的矛头都指向中国大陆。同时，一些美国情报官员和“对华军事战略和战术专家”正在由美国、日本东京和冲绳等地赶去台湾，参加策划侵略中国的罪恶行动。
    美国最近还把第一批F—100喷气战斗机六架移交给蒋介石的空军，以便增加蒋贼空军进行叛国战争的力量。美国对蒋介石海军和陆军的装备和供应最近也有了增加。美国积极增兵台湾和对蒋贼军“军事援助”的加强，是在企图玩弄“停火”阴谋的同时发生的，这就更加明显地暴露了美国所谓希望用和平办法解决台湾国际争端的虚伪。
    新华社开罗19日电　美国军舰“邦斯上尉号”昨天通过苏伊士运河，前往加强美国在远东的侵略军力。
    它是美国海军的一艘流动供应舰，载有一万一千吨供应品。
