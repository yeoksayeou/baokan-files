Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 20th - The worker-peasant-soldier labor army established in the rural areas of Shanxi Province has now expanded to over 4,290,000 people. This force has a total of 1,396 regiments and 6,421 battalions, including over 1,140,000 "field army" personnel and 3,148,000 "local army" personnel.

This new type of labor army has shown great superiority in tapping labor potential and improving labor efficiency. Due to the increase in production efficiency and work-hour utilization rate, the Yanbei area can increase by 200,000 labor days per day, solving the problem of labor shortage. In the Xinxian area, Wutai County extracted more than 30% of the labor force from various communes to form a 30,000-strong labor army. Among them, 10,000 "field army" personnel are responsible for seven major water conservancy projects, and 20,000 "local troops" are engaged in small and medium-sized projects and transportation construction, achieving unprecedented success. Many labor armies participated in large-scale reservoirs and engineering construction, carrying out large-scale cooperation across townships, communes, and counties, accelerating the progress of the project. When Pingshun County was building the Bailitan "Militia Combat Reservoir," more than 3,000 militiamen in the county worked hard for more than 100 days and nights, completing 160,000 cubic meters of earthwork, enabling the reservoir to store floodwater ahead of schedule and exert its benefits.

The military activities of the militia have also become increasingly active with the establishment of the labor army. This year, a total of 800,000 militiamen in the province participated in military training, including 310,000 backbone militiamen. In the spirit of "focusing on production, combining production with training," all localities have achieved not delaying work, reducing work delays, spending less money, and accomplishing more. Among the 39,000 militiamen who have already conducted live ammunition shooting, 76.5% achieved excellent results.

    劳武结合劳动效率大大提高
    山西工农兵劳动大军在生产上大显神通
    新华社太原20日电　山西省农村建立的工农兵相结合的劳动大军，目前已扩展到四百二十九万多人。这支队伍共有一千三百九十六个团、六千四百二十一个营，其中有“野战军”一百一十四万多人，“地方军”三百一十四万八千多人。
    这支新型的劳动大军，在挖掘劳动潜力、提高劳动效率方面，显示出了很大的优越性。由于生产效率和工时利用率提高，雁北地区每天共可增加二十万个劳动日，解决了劳力不足的问题。忻县专区的五台县从各社抽出30％多的劳力，组成一支三万名的劳动大军。其中一万“野战军”担负七处较大的水利工程，两万名“地方部队”大搞中小型工程和交通建设，取得了空前的成就。许多劳动大军在参加大型水库、工程建设中，突破乡界、社界、县界进行大协作，加速了工程进度。平顺县在修建百里滩“民兵战斗水库”时，全县三千多民兵苦战一百多昼夜，完成了十六万土方的任务，使水库提前拦洪蓄水，发挥效益。
    民兵的军事活动也随着劳动大军的建立日益活跃起来。全省今年共有八十万民兵参加了军事训练，其中基干民兵三十一万人。各地以“生产为主，结合生产进行训练”的精神，做到了不误工减少误工、少花钱多办事。在已进行实弹射击的三万九千个民兵中，成绩优良者占到了76.5％。
