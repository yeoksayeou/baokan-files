Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: TASS Moscow, August 31st: "Pravda" today published an article signed "Observer," titled: "Dangerous Playing with Fire," with the subtitle: "American Provocative Actions in the Far East." The full text of the article is as follows:

    Recent events in the Far East have attracted the attention of world public opinion. The U.S. military command ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet, assembled in the Taiwan area of China, to be on combat readiness. U.S. Air Force units were transferred there to reinforce the Seventh Fleet. At the same time, American politicians and military figures have made statements aimed at exacerbating the situation in the Far East and creating a war hysteria against the People's Republic of China. In their talks, they hypocritically stated that the U.S. military preparations in the region were "defensive."

    This hypocritical pretext, which conceals the aggressive essence of the American military preparations in the Far East, cannot deceive anyone. Even the public opinion of countries that have aggressive alliances with the United States points out that while they talk about "defensive measures," they are actually planning provocative military actions behind the scenes.

    Indeed, who would believe the claims of American government officials? They insist that they are dispatching their fleet to the distant coast of China to "defend" the United States.

    The United States is mobilizing its fleet not because it fears for its own security from the threat of the People's Republic of China, but because it wants to maintain a favorable strategic position for aggressive activities against the People's Republic of China and other Asian countries.

    As everyone knows, eight years ago the United States invaded and occupied Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other places in China. This is a blatant and arrogant act of aggression. Taiwan and other islands occupied by the United States have been an inseparable part of China for many centuries. Taiwan was incorporated into China's territory long before Columbus discovered the Americas. This indisputable historical fact cannot be denied by anyone. Even the United States does not deny this. It is precisely in recognition of the fact that Taiwan has historically belonged to China that, according to the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, the island was officially returned to China on October 25, 1945.

    Former President Truman, in order to excuse the aggressive act of the U.S. occupation of Chinese islands, attempted in his formal statement of June 27, 1950, to portray the U.S. action as "neutralizing" Taiwan during the Korean conflict. However, after the end of the Korean conflict, the U.S. ruling clique not only did not withdraw its troops but also turned Taiwan and other islands into an outpost for its aggressive policy in the Far East. Under the protection of the U.S. military, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which had seized Taiwan, repeatedly launched provocative attacks on Chinese coastal cities, obstructed the navigation of ships at sea, and carried out piratical attacks not only on ships of the People's Republic of China but also on ships of other countries.

    Recently, these provocative actions have become more frequent. U.S.-made military aircraft have constantly violated the airspace of People's China. Chiang Kai-shek elements, under the cover of the U.S. Air Force and Navy, have shelled the Chinese mainland from Jinmen Island. According to the confirmation of a United Press International reporter, U.S. troops are stationed on this island, which is close to the Chinese mainland.

    Chiang Gang's Provocations are Executing the Intentions of American Masters
    The Chinese Air Force and coastal artillery's counterattack against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched on Jinmen Island has caused an uproar in the Western press. As is often the case in such situations, American propagandists are attempting to shift the responsibility for escalating the situation in the region onto the People's Republic of China. However, everyone knows that the Chiang Kai-shek elements are carrying out military provocations in the Far East precisely to execute the intentions of their masters—the American imperialists.

    It is enough to point out that in the so-called "memorandum on the policy of non-recognition of the Chinese Communist regime" recently published by the U.S. State Department, the island of Taiwan occupies a special place in the U.S. aggressive policy. Dulles's agency has dropped all pretense and bluntly calls Taiwan a "strategic island" and actively uses this island to implement American military plans in the Far East. Many facts illustrate this point.

    According to the Associated Press, U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Beakley recently said that the U.S. Navy and the Chiang Kai-shek group's fleet will hold joint exercises in the southern waters of Taiwan in early September. According to him, the purpose of the exercise is to improve the combat effectiveness of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek troops, improve and develop joint operations techniques and principles, and strengthen close ties between the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Chiang Kai-shek group's troops. U.S. Thirteenth Air Force Commander Mooreman arrived in Taiwan from the U.S. Air Force base in the Philippines on August 26 in order to be closer to China. The U.S. Navy stationed in Japan has also entered combat readiness.

    The U.S. Policy of Military Intervention is Hopeless
    All this shows that the U.S. upholders of the policy of strength are plotting new military provocations in the Far East. The American imperialists vainly hope to turn back the wheels of history by force and impose the old system on the liberated people. However, even those instigators of brinkmanship who are dizzy with hatred for the great Chinese people should see clearly that such an attempt is hopeless.

    The U.S. military preparations have aroused the understandable concern of world public opinion, which considers such activities to be a serious threat to peace in the Far East.

    The dangerous policy adopted by the United States towards the People's Republic of China is widely condemned around the world. For example, the British bourgeois newspaper "Daily Mirror" said: "Britain should clearly announce that it will never fight to prevent Chiang Kai-shek from being driven out of Jinmen and Mazu." The diplomatic commentator of "The Scotsman" emphasized that "Whitehall (the seat of the British government) sources pointed out that the re-emergence of tension in the Formosa (Taiwan) region has caused differences between Washington and London."

    A commentator for the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" justly pointed out that if the United States withdrew its troops from Taiwan and removed the Seventh Fleet from the Taiwan Strait, the Taiwan issue could easily be resolved as an internal matter.

    The Indian "National Herald" wrote that the current actions of the United States near the Chinese mainland are "a deliberately manufactured provocation, a new and more dangerous example of brinkmanship." Another Indian newspaper, "Amrita Bazar Patrika," emphasized that the tension in the Far East "is the result of the unrealistic policy adopted by the United States towards Communist China. As long as this policy has not changed (and this change is necessary to ensure lasting peace in the Far East), the situation will always contain explosive potential."

    Needless to say, the provocative actions of the U.S. aggressive forces cannot but be resolutely countered by the People's Republic of China. No matter what excuses the American propaganda machine makes, no matter what tricks and deceptions they adopt, the United States can never escape its responsibility for escalating the international situation in the Far East.

    It should be stated directly: It is time for American imperialism to stop testing the patience of the Chinese people. It is time to stop the occupation of the island of Taiwan, which is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, but which has now been turned by U.S. aggressive forces into a source of constant provocations against the People's Republic of China. Liberating Taiwan and all other coastal islands belonging to China is the internal affair of the Chinese people. The Chinese people consider it their sacred duty to liberate their own territory, and no one can prevent them from realizing the unification of their motherland.

    Those who love military provocations should not forget that the People's Republic of China is not a small country with no power to defend itself, where the U.S. Marine Corps can land at will. The People's Republic of China has things to defend, and it also has the power to defend them. The era when imperialists could run rampant and domineering in China has gone forever.

    Many Loyal Friends Stand on the Side of the Chinese People
    The friends of the People's Republic of China—and it has many loyal friends—stand entirely on the side of the Chinese people. The Soviet people and the people of all countries of the powerful socialist camp support the just struggle of the fraternal Chinese people to restore their legitimate rights over Taiwan and other coastal islands.

    Today, whoever attempts to threaten the People's Republic of China with aggression should not forget that he is also threatening the Soviet Union. Because the Soviet Union and People's China have an inseparable fraternal friendship and cooperative relationship, which is based on the two countries' determination to ensure international peace and resist aggressors. The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are united in the struggle against all kinds of conspiracies of the enemies of peace. The Soviet Union will provide the necessary moral and material assistance to the just struggle of the People's Republic of China.

    The planners of armed provocations against the People's Republic of China should not think that they can confine the events to one place. Any aggressive action by the United States in the Far East will inevitably exacerbate the entire international situation and spread the war to other regions, thereby creating all the consequences. Those who are trying to play with fire dangerously in the Far East must be reminded of this once again.

    苏联“真理报”向美国发出警告
　　中国有力量坚决反击任何挑衅
    中苏团结一致　威胁中国就是威胁苏联
    新华社31日讯　塔斯社莫斯科31日电：“真理报”今天刊载了署名“观察家”的一篇文章，标题是：“危险的玩火行为”，副题是：“美国在远东的挑衅行动”。文章全文如下：
    最近远东事件引起了世界舆论的注意。美国军事司令部命令集结在中国台湾地区的美国第七舰队处于战斗准备状态。美国空军部队被调往那里增援第七舰队。同时，美国的政界人士和军界人士纷纷发表谈话，其目的是促使远东局势尖锐化和造成反对中华人民共和国的战争歇斯底里气氛。他们在谈话中虚伪地说，美国在这一地区的军事准备是“防御性”的。
    这种掩饰美国在远东的军事准备的侵略实质的伪善借口，是欺骗不了任何人的。甚至那些同美国有侵略联盟关系的国家的舆论也指出，他们嘴上谈的是“防御措施”，背后却是挑衅性的军事计划。
    的确，谁会相信美国政府人士的这种说法呢？他们硬说他们调遣自己的舰队去遥远的中国沿海是为了“保卫”美国。
    美国动员自己的舰队，并不是因为担心自己的安全受到中华人民共和国的威胁，而是因为他们要把便于对中华人民共和国和其他亚洲国家进行侵略活动的有利战略阵地保持在自己手里。
    大家知道，八年前美国侵占了中国的台湾、澎湖列岛等地。这是一种公然的蛮横的侵略。台湾和被美国占领的其他岛屿许多世纪以来一直是中国的不可分割的一部分。早在哥伦布发现美洲大陆以前很久，台湾就已列入中国的版图。这一无可置辩的历史事实是谁也不能否认的。就是美国也不否认这一点。正是承认台湾历来是属于中国的领土，根据开罗宣言和波茨坦宣言，这个岛于1945年10月25日正式归还中国。
    前总统杜鲁门为了替美国占领中国岛屿这种侵略行为开脱，在1950年6月27日的正式声明中企图把美国的行动说成是使台湾在朝鲜冲突期间“中立化”。但是，朝鲜冲突结束后，美国统治集团不但没有撤退自己的军队，而且把台湾和其他岛屿变成它对远东实行侵略政策的前哨。在美国军队庇护下窃据台湾的蒋介石卖国集团屡次对中国沿海城镇进行挑衅性的攻击，阻挠海上船只的通航，不仅对中华人民共和国的船只，而且对其他国家的船只进行海盗式的袭击。
    最近时期，这种挑衅行动更加频繁了。美制军用飞机不断侵犯人民中国的领空。蒋介石分子在美国海空军的掩护下从金门岛对中国大陆进行炮击。根据合众国际社记者的证实，在这个岛上，也就是在紧靠中国大陆的地方，驻扎有美国军队。
    蒋帮挑衅是执行美国主子的意图
    中国空军和海岸炮兵对盘据金门岛的蒋介石匪帮的反击引起了西方报刊的喧哗。像经常碰到的这类情况一样，美国的宣传家企图把这一地区局势尖锐化的责任推卸在中华人民共和国身上。可是，大家都知道，蒋介石分子在远东进行军事挑衅，正是执行他们的主子——美国帝国主义者的意图。
    只要指出这一点就够了：在美国国务院不久前发表的所谓“关于不承认中国共产党政权的政策”的备忘录中，台湾岛屿在美国的侵略政策中占有特殊的地位。杜勒斯的机关放下了一切伪装，直言不讳地把台湾称为“战略性的岛屿”，并且积极利用这个岛屿来实现美国在远东的军事计划。许多事实都说明了这一点。
    据美联社报道，美国第七舰队总司令比克利不久前说，美国海军和蒋介石集团的舰队将于九月初在台湾南部海洋举行联合演习。据他说，演习的目的是要提高美国军队和蒋介石军队的战斗力，改进和制定联合作战的技术和原则以及加强美国海军、海军陆战队和蒋介石集团军队之间的紧密联系。美国第十三航空队司令穆尔曼8月26日从菲律宾的美国空军基地来到台湾，以便更加接近中国。驻扎在日本的美国海军也进入战斗准备状态。
    美国的武力干涉政策是毫无希望的
    这一切说明，美国实力政策维护者阴谋在远东进行新的军事挑衅。美帝国主义者妄想靠武力使历史的车轮倒转，并把旧制度强加在解放了的人民身上，可是，即使是那些因为对伟大的中国人民怀着仇恨而晕头转向的战争边缘政策的鼓动者也应当看得很清楚：这种企图是毫无希望的。
    美国的备战活动引起了世界公众的理所当然的不安，他们认为这种活动是对远东和平的严重威胁。
    美国对中华人民共和国所采取的危险政策受到世界各地普遍的谴责。例如，英国资产阶级的“每日镜报”说：“英国应该明确宣布，它绝不为了蒋介石不被赶出金门岛和马祖岛而打仗”。“苏格兰人报”的外交评论员着重指出，“白厅（英国政府所在地）人士指出，重新出现的福摩萨（台湾）地区的紧张局势引起了华盛顿与伦敦之间的分歧”。
    日本“读卖新闻”的评论员公正地指出，如果美国从台湾撤出自己的军队，并从台湾海峡撤走第七舰队，那么台湾问题作为内部问题就可以很容易地得到解决。
    印度“国民先驱报”写道，美国现今在中国大陆附近的行动是“一个蓄意制造的挑衅，是战争边缘政策的一个新的、更加危险的事例”。另一家印度报纸“甘露市场报”着重指出，远东的紧张局势“是美国对共产党中国所采取的不现实的政策的结果。只要这一政策还没有什么改变（而这种改变对保障远东的持久和平是必须的），局势将永远蕴藏着爆炸性。”
    不用说，美国侵略势力的挑衅行动不能不遭到中华人民共和国的坚决的反击。不论美国宣传机关制造什么借口，不论他们采取怎样的诡计和欺骗手段，美国总逃避不了它对远东地区国际局势尖锐化的责任。
    应该直接了当地说：已经是美帝国主义停止试验中国人民的忍耐力的时候了。已经是停止对台湾岛的占领的时候了，台湾岛是中国领土的不可分割的一部分，但是它现在硬被美国侵略势力变成了不断对中华人民共和国进行挑衅的策源地。解放台湾和所有属于中国的其他沿海岛屿是中国人民的内政。中国人民认为解放自己的国土是神圣的义务，谁也不能阻挠他们实现自己祖国的统一。
    军事挑衅的爱好者不应当忘记，中华人民共和国不是美国海军陆战队可以任意登陆的无力自卫的小国。中华人民共和国有东西需要保卫，同时也有力量保卫。帝国主义者可以无耻地在中国横行霸道的时代已一去不复返了。
　　许多忠实的朋友站在中国人民一边
    中华人民共和国的朋友——它有许多忠实的朋友——完全站在中国人民这边。苏联人民和强大的社会主义阵营的各国人民，都支持兄弟的中国人民为恢复对台湾和其他沿海岛屿的合法权利而进行的正义斗争。
    今天，谁企图用进攻来威胁中华人民共和国，那他就不应该忘记，他也就是在威胁苏联。因为，苏联和人民中国有着不可分割的兄弟友好和合作的关系，这种合作关系是建立在两国决心保证国际和平和反击侵略者的基础之上的。苏联和中华人民共和国在反对和平敌人的形形色色的各种阴谋的斗争中是团结一致的。苏联对于中华人民共和国的正义斗争，将给予必需的道义上和物质上的援助。
    对中华人民共和国进行武装挑衅的策划者不要以为他们满可以把事件局限于一地。美国在远东的任何侵略行动，都不可避免地会促使整个国际局势尖锐化，并使战争蔓延到其他地区，从而产生一切后果。对那些试图在远东危险地玩火的人必须再一次提醒这一点。
