　　Motherland, Give the Order!
    We are Waiting at All Times
    We are all demobilized and transferred construction soldiers. In the past, we joined the army and took up weapons to liberate the motherland and resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Now we unanimously express: U.S. imperialism will definitely invade our country, so we are always prepared for the motherland's call, determined to put on our military uniforms again, take up our guns, and go to the front line to punish the invaders and liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan.

    We are early childhood educators, and we have a responsibility to ensure that every child can grow up happily in the socialist motherland. We will never allow the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to continue to use war to threaten the safety of our children.
    All of our faculty and staff are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and contribute all our strength to liberate Taiwan and protect our children.

    We want to solemnly warn the U.S. aggressors: The powerful 600 million Chinese people are determined to liberate their own territory, coastal islands, and Taiwan. The righteous people of the world are also standing on our side. If anyone dares to obstruct us, we will completely eliminate them!
    All our teachers, students, and staff unanimously and resolutely express: We are ready to listen to the call of the motherland at any time and use practical actions to support Premier Zhou's statement.

    Liberating Taiwan is the duty of each of us. Therefore, we must strengthen military training, master the skills to defend the motherland, and be ready at all times. Once the motherland needs us, we will immediately put down our books, pick up our weapons, and go to the front line to strike the invaders, defend our great, sacred, and inviolable motherland, and defend world peace!

    After a deep criticism of the bourgeois academic ideology movement, all comrades of our Institute of Mathematics are full of confidence and soaring enthusiasm, determined to directly serve the country's construction with mathematical knowledge. We firmly support Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area. Once the motherland issues a call, we will resolutely participate in the struggle to defend the motherland, thoroughly defeat the imperialist aggressors, defend the motherland, and defend world peace!
