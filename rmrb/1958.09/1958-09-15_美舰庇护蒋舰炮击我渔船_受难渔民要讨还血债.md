Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 14th: On the morning of the 8th, eight Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships, notorious for harming civilians, under the shelter of seven US warships, frantically shelled the "Jinliyuan" fishing boat of the Qian'an Fishing Cooperative in Huian County, Fujian Province, near Dongding Island. The fishing boat was destroyed on the spot, and of the eighteen fishermen on board, four were killed and two were seriously injured. After being shelled, the injured fishermen and the other twelve surviving fishermen escaped to sea in three small sampans. On the morning of the 9th, they were rescued by ships of our People's Navy that rushed to the scene after hearing the news, near the sea off Hutou Mountain. This is yet another new atrocity committed by the Chiang bandits in the coastal areas, killing our compatriots under the protection of the US aggressor troops.

On the morning of the 8th, the "Jinliyuan" fishing boat, carrying more than 700 catties of dried squid and the main fishing gear of the Qian'an Fishing Cooperative, left Wuyu and was sailing north back to Chongwu. At about 9 o'clock, when the fishing boat reached the sea three or four nautical miles north of Dongding Island, a large number of US and Chiang Kai-shek ships suddenly sailed from the outer sea. Among them, eight Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships barbarously strafed our fishing boat with machine guns when they approached it within a few hundred meters, and continuously shelled the fishing boat, killing fishermen Chen Rongfa, Chen Qishi, and two others on the spot. Fisherman Chen Rongshan's left chest and Chen Deliang's arm were seriously injured in these two shellings. It was not until after 11 o'clock that these Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships closely followed the US warships and fled to the outer ocean.

The towering crime of the US aggressor troops sheltering the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in their frenzied killing of our peaceful and productive fishermen has aroused great indignation among our coastal people. On the 12th, more than two hundred representatives from more than 150 fishing boats docked in Xiamen Port gathered at the Xiamen Fishermen's Association to angrily denounce the towering crimes of the US-Chiang Kai-shek warships. The fishermen raised their arms and shouted: "US aggressor troops get out of Taiwan!" "We must liberate Taiwan!" "Avenge the dead compatriots and demand blood debt from the Chiang Kai-shek bandits!" Chen Huihuang, director of the Qian'an Fishing Cooperative, said at the meeting that the cooperative members will never forget the bloody hatred of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and must turn their anger into strength, do a good job in their current work, and support the People's Liberation Army in fiercely attacking the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

    美舰庇护蒋舰炮击我渔船
    受难渔民要讨还血债
    据新华社福建前线14日电　8日上午，残民成性的八艘蒋贼军舰艇，在七艘美国军舰庇护下，在福建省东椗岛附近海面疯狂炮击我惠安县前垵渔业社“金利远”号渔船，当场将我渔船击毁，船上的十八个渔民，四人被打死，两人受重伤。受伤渔民和其它十二个遇难渔民在遭受炮击后，分乘三艘小舢舨下海逃生，9日上午被我人民海军闻讯赶往抢救的船只在虎头山附近海面救回。这是蒋贼军在美国侵略军的庇护下，在沿海地区残杀我同胞的又一新的暴行。
    “金利远”号渔船在8日早晨载着七百多斤鱿鱼干和前垵渔业社的主要渔具，离开浯屿北航回崇武。九时许，渔船到达东垵岛以北三、四海里的海面时，突然从外海驶来大批美、蒋舰艇，其中，八艘蒋贼军舰艇在驶近我渔船只有几百公尺距离时，就野蛮地用机枪向渔船扫射，并连续向渔船发炮当场打死渔民陈荣发、陈乞食等四人。渔民陈荣山的左胸侧和陈德良的臂部在这两次炮击中受重伤。到十一点多钟，这些蒋贼军舰才紧紧追随在美国军舰的后面向外洋逸去。
    美国侵略军庇护蒋贼军疯狂残杀我和平生产的渔民的滔天罪行，激起我沿海人民的极大愤恨。12日，停泊在厦门港的一百五十多条渔船的代表两百多人在厦门市渔民协会集会，愤怒控诉美蒋军舰的滔天罪行。渔民们振臂高呼：“美国侵略军从台湾滚出去！”“一定要解放台湾！”“为死难同胞报仇，向蒋贼军讨还血债！”前垵渔业社社长陈辉煌在会上表示，社员们永远不会忘记蒋贼军的血海深仇，一定要化愤怒为力量，做好当前工作，支援解放军狠狠地打击蒋贼军。
