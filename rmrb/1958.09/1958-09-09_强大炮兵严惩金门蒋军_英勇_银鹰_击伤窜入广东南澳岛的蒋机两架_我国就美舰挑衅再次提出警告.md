Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Fujian, 8th, 1 PM: A spokesman for our army on the front lines of Fujian declared: Since the 4th of this month, the Chiang troops entrenched on Kinmen and its nearby islands have continuously shelled our coastal villages and towns near Xiamen, causing serious damage to the lives and property of our people. It is particularly intolerable that students at Jiangtou Town No. 3 Middle School, who were in class, suffered heavy casualties. At the same time, today, the U.S. and Chiang navies conducted a joint landing exercise near Fangliao, south of Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and even clamored to attack the Chinese mainland. In order to warn against this provocation, our artillery units on the Fujian front lines today once again launched a punitive strike against the Chiang troops entrenched on Kinmen.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th: Our Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force fighter jet units shot down two F86-type U.S.-made Chiang planes.

At 9:50 AM today, two batches of sixteen U.S.-made Chiang F86 jet fighters intruded into the airspace over the Nan'ao Island area of Guangdong Province to carry out harassment and sabotage activities. Our People's Air Force immediately rose to intercept them, damaging two Chiang planes. The Chiang military aircraft, severely hit, fled towards Taiwan in a panic.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th, 11 AM: Following the intrusion of four U.S. warships into our territorial waters on September 7th, eight more U.S. warships were discovered from 10:40 AM on September 8th to have successively intruded into our 12-nautical-mile territorial waters of the Kinmen and Xiamen areas to conduct activities. A spokesman for our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, under instruction, stated that after our government issued a serious warning, U.S. warships once again violated our territorial waters. This is clearly a most dangerous act of deliberate provocation. The Chinese government once again issues a serious warning regarding this.

　　强大炮兵严惩金门蒋军
    英勇“银鹰”击伤窜入广东南澳岛的蒋机两架
　　我国就美舰挑衅再次提出警告
    新华社福建前线8日下午1时电　福建前线我军发言人宣称：盘据金门及其附近岛屿的蒋军本月4日以来连续向我厦门附近沿海村镇进行炮击，使我人民的生命财产受到了严重损失，特别不能容忍的是正在上课的江头镇第三中学的学生蒙受了重大伤亡。同时，今日美蒋海军在台湾高雄以南枋寮附近海域进行联合的登陆演习，并且扬言进攻中国大陆。为了警告这种挑衅，我福建前线炮兵部队，今日再次对盘据金门的蒋军，进行了惩罚性的打击。
    新华社广州8日电　我中国人民解放军空军歼击机部队击伤F86型美制蒋机两架。
    今天上午九点五十分，美制蒋军F86型喷气战斗机两批十六架，窜入广东省南澳岛地区上空，进行骚扰破坏活动。我人民空军当即凌空迎击，打伤蒋机两架。受到严重打击的蒋军飞机，狼狈地向台湾方向逃去。
    新华社8日上午11时讯　继9月7日四艘美国军舰侵入我国领海之后，9月8日上午十时四十分起，又发现有美国军舰八艘先后侵入我国金门、厦门地区的领海十二浬以内，进行活动。我外交部发言人奉命声明，在我国政府提出严重警告以后，美国军舰竟又一次侵犯我国领海，这显然是蓄意挑衅的最危险的行动，中国政府对此再次提出严重警告。
