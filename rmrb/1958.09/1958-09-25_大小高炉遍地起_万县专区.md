Small and Large Blast Furnaces Spring Up Everywhere
——Wanxian Prefecture
Selected New Folk Songs:

	Small and large blast furnaces spring up everywhere,
	Molten iron flows like waves,
	Don't say the countryside lacks experts,
	Miracles abound for you to see,
	Braving the cold wind, we smelt iron,
	Enough to bother those foreign experts.
		(Yunyang)

	Effort soars to the sky like a long rainbow,
	We will make the blast furnace burn red hot,
	Smelting steel surpasses Lao Tzu's furnace,
	Scaring away the Monkey King Sun Wukong.
		(Wanxian)

	Every house plants a red flag,
	Labor songs fill the air,
	Like sunflowers facing the sun,
	We await the inspection team.
	Blast furnaces rise from the ground,
	Molten iron radiates red light,
	Ironworkers offer this gift,
	With iron, we can have steel!
		(Wuxi)

	The iron smelting furnace, tall and high,
	Blue smoke rises straight into the clouds,
	The Jade Emperor cries out he can't bear it,
	The gods' eyes tear up from the smoke.
		(Kaixian)

    大小高炉遍地起
    ——万县专区
    新民歌选大小高炉遍地起，铁水奔流似波涛，莫说农村专家少，奇迹之花够你瞧，冷风全焦炼出铁，够洋专家把心操。
              （云阳）干劲冲天如长虹，要使高炉火通红，炼钢赛过老君炉，吓退猴王孙悟空。
              （万县）家家插红旗，劳动歌声欢，如像葵花盼太阳，盼来检查团。高炉平地起，铁水放红光，铁工献上这份礼，有铁才有钢！
              （巫溪）炼铁炉，高又高，青烟直上九云霄，玉皇高叫受不住，众神熏得眼泪抛。
              （开县）
