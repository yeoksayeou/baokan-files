　　The Whole People Fight for Steel
　　Liu Feng
    The enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party has issued a resounding call to us: to strive to produce 10.7 million tons of steel in 1958, which is double the output of 5.35 million tons in 1957. This is a historically significant and inspiring great call.
    This great call reflects the will of the 600 million Chinese people. People demand the acceleration of industrialization; to equip agriculture with powerful machinery; this will, specifically speaking, is the "current huge need for steel and the huge effort for steel production by the people of the whole country."
    Our people, who have been liberated, fully understand that their needs must be realized by their own hands. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, they have long started "the huge effort for steel production." This huge effort is not only manifested in the great leap forward in the production of large steel enterprises, but also in the blossoming of small blast furnaces everywhere; and also in the fact that the people of the whole country, regardless of men, women, old and young, are doing their best to develop steel production. We constantly see such examples: some people dig up the fire bricks on the floor of their houses and donate them to build small blast furnaces; in some places, in order to prepare materials for building small blast furnaces, the people of the whole city are breaking pots and smashing porcelain bowls... The whole people fighting for steel will make blast furnaces spring up everywhere and molten iron flow in all directions. It is based on this high degree of enthusiasm and this huge force of the entire people that our Party recognizes that the leap forward development of steel production is possible.
    The people need steel, the people will produce steel, and 10.7 million tons of steel is completely necessary and completely possible. The Party has already pointed out the goal for us, and our task is to achieve this goal. Achieving such a task is not without difficulties, but there are no insurmountable difficulties. What is urgently needed is to fully organize the enthusiasm and initiative of the people, strengthen planning and discipline, mobilize large, medium, and small enterprises together, combine indigenous and foreign methods, and carry out nationwide communist collaboration. This kind of great collaboration among the people is now flourishing. The following are examples of this collaboration: On August 23, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory published a message in the newspaper "Seeking Broken Crock Sand," and immediately received more than 70 calls, all expressing their willingness to support the crock sand without compensation. On August 29, the front page of the Liberation Daily published a news item entitled "Who Will Support?", stating that the Shanghai Steel Plant urgently needed ferrosilicon and requested fraternal units to vigorously support the steel plant's needs with surplus or temporarily unused ferrosilicon. By 4 pm on the day the news was published, eleven fraternal enterprises had contacted them, supporting a total of fifty-two tons.
    People with this kind of cooperative spirit naturally have a lofty communist consciousness, but at the same time, they also understand the huge demand for steel from the people of the whole country; they also understand that the development of the steel industry is an arduous joint operation of multiple arms, and any decentralism and departmentalism that are harmful to unified action and planning will damage the common interests of the people. Those very few people who still refuse to cooperate with others for various reasons not only lack basic communist morality, but also lack basic knowledge of social production, and are, in fact, doing things that are detrimental to the interests of the 600 million people. For the sake of 10.7 million tons, let all our people mobilize, fully develop the communist spirit, and collaborate together to advance bravely towards victory!

### 全民为钢而战

　　全民为钢而战
　　刘丰
    党的中央政治局扩大会议，向我们发出了一个响亮的号召：为在1958年生产一千零七十万吨钢，即比1957年的产量五百三十五万吨增加一倍而奋斗。这是一个有历史意义的振奋人心的伟大号召。
    这个伟大的号召，反映了六亿中国人民的意志。人们要求加速工业化建设；用强大的机械来装备农业；这种意志，具体地说就是“当前全国人民对于钢铁的巨大需要和对于钢铁生产的巨大努力”。
    我们的人民，是已经解放了的人民，完全懂得自己的需要是要依靠自己的双手来实现的。因此，他们早就已在党的领导下开始了“对于钢铁生产的巨大努力”。这种巨大的努力，不仅表现为大钢铁企业生产上的突飞猛进，也表现为小高炉的遍地开花；而且也表现为全国人民不分男女老少一齐为发展钢铁生产尽自己的力量。我们不断看到这样的事例：有的人把自己屋里地上的火砖挖起来，捐献出去砌小高炉；有的地方为了给建小高炉准备材料，全市人民都动手敲破缸碎碗片……全民为钢铁而战，就能使得高炉遍地起，铁水纵横流。我们党根据全体人民的这种高度积极性，这种巨大的力量，才认定钢铁生产的飞跃的发展是可能的。
    人民需要钢铁，人民会生产钢铁，一千零七十万吨钢完全必要又完全可能。党已经给我们指明了前进的目标，我们的任务就是去实现这种目标。实现这样一个任务，不是没有困难，但并没有不可克服的困难。迫切需要的是把人民这种积极性、主动性，充分地组织起来，加强计划性和纪律性，大中小企业一齐发动，土洋并举，进行全民的共产主义大协作。现在人民之间的这种大协作正在蓬勃开展。下面就有这种协作的榜样：8月23日，上海机床厂在报上登了一条“征求破缸砂”的消息，马上就接到了七十多个电话，都表示愿意无代价地支援缸砂。8月29日解放日报一版登了一个题为“谁来支援？”的新闻，说明了上海炼钢厂急需矽铁，要求各兄弟单位，把多余的或暂时用不着的矽铁，大力支援炼钢的需要。消息登出当天下午四时止，就有十一个兄弟企业单位来电话联系，一共支援了五十二吨。
    具有这种协作精神的人，自然是因为他们具有崇高的共产主义意识，但同时，他们也懂得全国人民对于钢铁的巨大需求；他们更懂得钢铁工业的发展是一个艰巨的多兵种协同作战的联合性战役，任何有害统一行动和计划性的分散主义、本位主义的行为，都会使人民的共同利益遭受损伤。那些极少数的至今还以种种借口拒绝同人协作的人，既缺乏起码的共产主义道德，又缺乏起码的社会生产的知识，而且，自己正是在作着有损六亿人民利益的事情。为了一千零七十万吨，让我们全体人民动员起来，充分发扬共产主义精神，共同协作向胜利奋勇前进！
