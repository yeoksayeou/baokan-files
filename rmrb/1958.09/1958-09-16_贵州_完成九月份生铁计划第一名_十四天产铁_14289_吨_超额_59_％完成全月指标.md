(This article is from our newspaper in Guiyang on the 15th) Guizhou Province's pig iron production has seen rapid progress under the leadership of the entire Party and all the people. By September 14th, it had already produced 14,289 tons of iron, completing the September leap forward plan of 9,000 tons 16 days ahead of schedule, exceeding the target by 59%. In recent days, despite heavy rain posing a significant threat to pig iron production, daily pig iron production has remained above 1,200 tons, nearly double the daily output in August. After exceeding the plan, Guizhou Province has decided to strive to produce a total of 40,000 tons of pig iron in September.

In late August, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) went all out to lead steel production, with seven days as a production campaign. At the end of each campaign, the province conducted a general inspection and summary, and arranged new production tasks. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee transferred more than 200 technical personnel, including smelting, testing, and machinery experts, to form a "barefoot doctor" team for native blast furnaces. They went to various special districts, autonomous prefectures, and counties to conduct "consultations" and help local areas solve some technical problems in pig iron production.

Since late August, the local (prefecture) and county Party committees have, on the one hand, organized more than 600,000 laborers to join the battle for pig iron production; on the other hand, a large number of leading cadres have gone to the front line to set up experimental furnaces and "secretary" furnaces. The secretary of the Zunyi Special District in charge of industry worked day and night at the blast furnace, gaining a complete set of experience in political leadership and solving various technical problems, which was then promoted. The first wave of the high tide of pig iron production in September has arrived. On average, nearly 200 new blast furnaces are put into production every day.

On September 10th, the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee of the CCP conducted an inspection of the pig iron production situation in various regions. Based on the new situation of the rapid launch of local blast furnaces in various places, it also pointed out the vigorous promotion of anthracite coal for iron smelting, the rapid change from cold air to hot air; vigorously summarizing and promoting local mechanical air blowing and sorting out the highly effective improved bellows; summarizing and promoting technical operating experience with normal production and high iron output; mobilizing all manpower and material resources to do a good job in the mining and transportation of raw materials such as ore and coal, and other seven major measures, requiring all regions to quickly implement them based on their specific conditions, and set off a high tide of iron production with a long stream of molten iron. It also requires all regions to pass the technical barrier and gradually achieve 10,000 to 12,000 local blast furnaces in production throughout the province in September, with the daily output of pig iron in the province reaching 4,000 tons; the daily output of each local blast furnace should be increased from the recent 0.18 tons to more than 0.4 tons.

After receiving the instructions from the Provincial Party Committee, all regions held telephone conferences overnight to implement them, setting off a massive national iron-smelting campaign. Now, the first secretaries of all counties in the province have personally taken command and moved to the blast furnace to work and direct operations. Agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have also set off a wave of support for blast furnaces. During the busy autumn harvest, they engaged in large-scale cooperation to rush to repair blast furnaces and help transport ore and coal. The grain, oil, salt, and vegetables needed by the blast furnace workers were also given priority. To ensure normal production, all counties have paid attention to the construction of steel bases and will build simple factory buildings for blast furnaces in general.

    贵州——完成九月份生铁计划第一名
    十四天产铁14289吨　超额59％完成全月指标
    本报贵阳15日电　贵州省炼铁工业在全党全民动手下，生铁生产突飞猛进。到9月14日，已产铁一万四千二百八十九吨，提前十六天超额59％完成了9月份九千吨的跃进计划。在最近几天中，虽然大雨滂沱，对生铁生产威胁很大，但每天生铁生产仍在一千二百吨以上，比8月份日产量增加约一倍。在超额完成计划以后，贵州省决定争取9月份一共生产生铁四万吨。
    8月下旬，中共贵州省委就全力以赴地领导钢铁生产，以七天为一个生产战役，每到一个战役结束时，全省普遍检查一次，总结一次，并布置新的生产任务。在此同时省委又抽调了二百多名包括冶炼、化验和机械的技术人员组织土高炉医疗队，分赴各专、州、县进行“会诊”，帮助各地解决生铁生产中的若干技术问题。
    从8月下旬起，各地（州）、县委一面组织了六十多万劳动力投入生铁生产战斗；一面大批领导干部开到现场，举办试验炉、“书记”炉。遵义专区每一个县委管工业的书记都日夜奋战在高炉，取得政治领导工作和解决各项技术问题的全套经验，加以推广。进入9月生产生铁高潮的前浪已经到来。每天新投入生产的高炉，平均将近二百座。
    9月10日，中共贵州省委对各地生铁生产情况作了一次检查，根据各地土高炉迅速上马的新形势，又指出了大力推广无烟煤炼铁，迅速改冷风为热风；大力总结推广土机械鼓风和整理宏效的改良风箱；总结推广正常生产和出铁量高的技术操作经验；动员一切人力、物力作好矿石、煤炭的开采和运输等原材料供应工作等七大措施，要求各地根据具体情况迅速加以贯彻，掀起一个铁水长流的出铁生产高潮。并要求各地要过好技术关，在9月内逐步做到全省有一万至一万二千座土高炉投入生产，全省生铁日产量达到四千吨；每座土高炉的日产量由最近的零点一八吨提高到零点四吨以上。
    各地接到省委的指示后，都连夜召开了电话会议贯彻，掀起声势浩大的全民炼铁运动。现在，全省各县的第一书记，都已亲自挂帅，搬到高炉旁办公，指挥作战。各地农业生产合作社，也掀起支援高炉的热潮，在繁忙秋收工作中，搞大协作，赶修高炉，帮助运矿、运煤。高炉工人所需粮食、油盐、蔬菜也得到优先供应。为保证正常生产，各县都已注意了钢铁基地的建设，并要给高炉普遍修建简易厂房。
