    Great Leap Forward in Aquatic Products Industry
    By Gao Wenhua, Vice Minister of Aquatic Products

    This year, China's aquatic products industry, like other construction undertakings, is developing by leaps and bounds. In the first half of the year, the country produced a total of more than 2.5 million tons of aquatic products, an increase of nearly 100% compared with the same period last year. According to recent inspections, the national aquatic product output is expected to reach 8.2 million tons or more this year, which means it will increase by 150% to more than 200% compared with last year's total output. The original target of 8 million tons by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan can be greatly exceeded this year. This is a victory for the Party's general line of socialist construction.
    The main characteristic of this year's Great Leap Forward in aquatic products is the significant expansion of freshwater and marine aquaculture areas. Due to the implementation of the principle of focusing on aquaculture, the freshwater aquaculture area has expanded from 15.8 million mu to 25 million mu, and the marine aquaculture area has expanded from 900,000 mu to 1.9 million mu. The development in this one year has exceeded the total of the past five years. In Hebei Province, 41 counties and cities have stocked fish in all available water areas. Zhangbei, Shangdu, and other five counties, which had long abandoned 400,000 to 500,000 mu of large and small saline lakes, are now raising grey mullet. In the remote Heilongjiang Province, this year they have also broken the concern that "fish farming cannot overwinter when frozen three feet deep," and not only build dikes in useless dry ditches to store water for fish farming, but also regard rivers and lakes as fish ponds for stocking fish. It is stipulated that for every jin of fish caught in the river, one fish fry must be released, integrating breeding and fishing. In addition, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other places that have never raised fish before have also started to raise fish this year.
    Diversification of species is the second characteristic of this year's aquatic products production. All localities have broken the old rules of "suitable" and "unsuitable" for raising. In freshwater aquaculture, in the past, only a few species such as so-called "domestic fish" including grass carp, silver carp, and bighead carp were raised, and other fish were regarded as "wild fish," "miscellaneous fish," and "harmful fish" and not raised. Now this superstition has been eliminated, and localized materials are used for multiple stocking. From carp, crucian carp, bream, and other fish to turtles, frogs, loach, etc., they are all stocked according to local conditions. Even mullet, grey mullet, prawns, etc., which are produced in the sea and were previously thought to only grow in the sea, have become new varieties of freshwater aquaculture. In marine aquaculture, artificial breeding has been carried out on everything from mullet, grey mullet, sea bass, flounder, abalone, sea cucumber, prawns, green crab, and swimming crab to pearl oysters, seahorses, sea hares, and sharks. Kelp has been widely farmed from north to south. Shellfish such as oysters, razor clams, clams, and blood clams in the south have also begun to be farmed in the coastal provinces of the north.
    In the past, aquaculture seedlings were collected from natural sources, which were limited by time, location, water temperature, and water fertility, and could not meet the needs of large-scale stocking. This year, artificial seedling breeding has achieved good results. The main species that can now be artificially controlled for spawning, hatching, and seedling breeding include silver carp, bighead carp, grass carp, carp, sea cucumber, scallops, seahorses, and many others; and many more species are being tested. In this way, everything from spawning and hatching to growing can be carried out according to people's will. This is a victory achieved by the vast number of fishermen and aquatic science and technology workers in our country under the leadership of the Party, breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and giving full play to the spirit of daring to think and daring to do.
    The continuous increase in yield per unit area and the endless emergence of bumper harvest satellites are also obvious signs of this year's Great Leap Forward in aquatic products.
    In pond fish farming, there are already fifteen satellites in Hunan and Hubei provinces with yields of more than 10,000 jin per mu, totaling eighty-two mu. Yueping Commune in Hengyang, Hunan, created a record of an average yield of 30,125 jin per mu in a 2.89 mu bumper harvest pond, which is seven times higher than the national record of 3,765 jin per mu set by the commune last year. Rice-fish farming has also been greatly developed. The 98 mu of rice-fish paddies in Sanhe Commune, Yangbu Township, Mianyang County, Hubei Province, had an average yield of 2,323 jin of fish and 2,000 jin of rice per mu; the 1.6 mu of rice-fish paddies in Longxin Commune, Longwan Township, Qianjiang County, had an average yield of 4,713 jin of fish and 3,002 jin of rice per mu, achieving a double bumper harvest of fish and rice. The 19.5 mu of kelp in the Mashan River aquaculture area of the Luda Aquatic Products Aquaculture Farm had an average yield of 23,440 jin per mu. The one mu of laver in Tangyu Fishing Cooperative, Pingtan County, Fujian Province, produced 42,000 jin. The 15.4 mu of oysters in the Jiali Agricultural Oyster Cooperative, Jintao Village, Yinglin Township, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, had an average yield of 4,432 jin of oyster meat per mu, of which the highest five mu had an average yield of 6,562.5 jin per mu, more than doubling the national record of 2,400 jin per mu set by the Shajing Oyster Cooperative in Baoan County, Guangdong last year. It is not yet the time for the final harvest of various products, but it is entirely certain that new and higher yields will continue to emerge.
    The significant improvement and enhancement of fishing gear and fishing techniques is another characteristic of this year's Great Leap Forward in China's aquatic products industry. In the spring and summer fishing seasons this year, marine fishing production achieved great results. By the end of August, the country had produced more than 1.4 million tons of marine fish, close to the total output of the entire year last year, which is inseparable from the improvement of fishing gear and the enhancement of fishing techniques. Many areas have promoted the ball bearing of anchor lifting, net lifting, and human-powered propellers, which greatly reduces manual labor, improves work efficiency and speed, and increases output. In addition, fishermen in coastal provinces went to sea a month earlier than in previous years; they continued to operate without resting in the summer heat, and carried several kinds of nets on each trip, implementing day fishing and night netting, trawling in windy weather, and fishing at sea in calm weather. At night, they also used lights and electric lights to lure fish, which has enabled China's aquatic products to develop at a leaping speed.
    These great achievements are worthy of rejoicing and encouragement, but we must not be complacent or slacken our efforts because of this. We must develop China's aquatic products production at an even higher speed than now and continue to create miracles. Although the fish are already in the ponds, and other farmed aquatic animals and plants are growing well, arduous efforts are still needed to catch them. At the same time, in order to achieve a greater leap forward in aquatic products production next year, we must also make full preparations. Although the area of freshwater aquaculture has doubled this year, it is still far from comparable to China's rich resources: only more than one-third of the 100 million mu of freshwater area suitable for aquaculture has been utilized; only one-seventh of the 15 million mu of marine area suitable for aquaculture has been utilized. We need to further mobilize the masses, expand stocking, and utilize all areas suitable for aquaculture from the sea to freshwater, from inland to the border areas. From the perspective of yield per unit area, various high-yield satellites have now appeared. The recently held national on-site conferences on freshwater and marine aquaculture and marine fishing production summarized and exchanged various advanced experiences. All localities must promote these experiences in large-scale production so that various productions can be universally improved and the total output can be rapidly increased. While vigorously developing marine and freshwater aquaculture, it is also necessary to increase the construction of fishing vessels and motorized sailing vessels with large hulls and high speeds, gradually transform the manual operation of existing wooden sailing vessels into mechanized or semi-mechanized operation, increase the installation of modern scientific navigation instruments and telecommunications equipment, continue to carry out technological innovation of existing ship nets, and improve marine fishing capabilities.
    Developing aquatic products plays an important role in improving people's lives, increasing the country's capital accumulation, and accelerating the development of industrial and agricultural production. Our Party has always attached great importance to the development of the aquatic products industry. After the realization of people's communes in the vast rural areas of the country, the comprehensive economy of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery will be further developed. In the future, all counties, townships, and communes with conditions for developing aquatic products should, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, make arrangements for fishery production in the comprehensive economic plan so that aquatic products production can develop at a higher speed.

    水产事业在大跃进中
    水产部副部长  高文华
    今年我国水产事业也像其他建设事业一样飞跃地向前发展着。上半年全国共生产水产品二百五十多万吨，比去年同期增长了将近一倍。根据最近检查，今年全国水产产量预计可以完成八百二十万吨，或者更多一些，就是说，将比去年总产量增加一倍半到二倍以上；原先设想的第二个五年计划末达到八百万吨的指标，今年就可以大大超过。这是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利。
    今年水产大跃进的主要特征是淡水和海水养殖面积大大扩大了。由于贯彻了以养为主的方针，淡水养殖面积由一千五百八十万亩扩大到二千五百万亩，海水养殖面积由九十万亩扩大到一百九十万亩，今年一年的发展就超过了过去五年的总和。河北省已有四十一个县、市把一切可以利用的水面都养了鱼，张北、商都等五县过去长期荒废的四、五十万亩大小咸水湖，现在已经养了鮻鱼。边远的黑龙江省，今年也打破了“冰冻三尺，养鱼无法越冬”的顾虑，不仅用无用的干沟筑堤储水养鱼，而且还要把江河湖泊当作鱼塘来放养鱼类，规定在江河里捕一斤鱼就要投放一尾鱼种，使养和捕结成一体。此外，陕西、新疆、青海等从未养过鱼的地方，今年也开始养鱼了。
    品种多样化是今年水产生产中的第二个特征。各地都打破了“可养”与“不可养”的陈规界线。在淡水养殖中，过去只养所谓“家鱼”青、草、鲢、鳙等少数几种，把别的鱼都当作“野鱼”、“杂鱼”，“害鱼”而不养，现在这种迷信已经破除了，做到就地取材、多种放养，从鲤、鲫、鳊等鱼类到甲鱼、青蛙、泥鳅等，都因地制宜地放养起来。连海里出产、过去一向认为只能在海里生长的鲻、鮻、对虾等，也成为淡水养殖的新品种了。在海水养殖中，从鲻、鮻、魲、比目鱼、鲍鱼、海参、对虾、青蟹和梭子蟹等一直到珍珠贝、海马、海兔和鲨鱼等等都进行了人工养殖。海带已经从北到南大养起来。南方的贝类牡蛎、蛏、蛤、蚶，现在北方沿海各省也都开始了放养。
    养殖的苗种，过去都是采捞天然苗，这要受时间、地点、水温、水肥等的限制，不能满足大量放养的需要。今年用人工培苗育种，得到了很好的成绩。现在能够人工控制产卵孵化培苗育种的主要品种已经有鲢、鳙、草鱼、鲤鱼、海参、干贝、海马等多种；还有许多品种正在试验。这样，从产卵孵化一直到培育成长都可以按照人们的意志来进行。这是我国广大渔民和水产科学技术工作者在党的领导下，破除迷信、解放思想，发挥敢想敢干的独创精神所取得的胜利。
    单位面积产量不断提高和丰产卫星的层出不穷，也是今年水产大跃进的明显标志。
    池塘养鱼，湖南、湖北两省亩产万斤以上的卫星已经有十五个，共八十二亩。湖南衡阳岳屏社在二点八九亩的丰产塘里创造了平均亩产三万零一百二十五斤的纪录，这比去年这个社所创的全国最高纪录三千七百六十五斤提高了七倍。稻田养鱼也有了极大发展，湖北沔阳县杨步乡三合社的九十八亩养鱼稻田，平均亩产鱼二千三百二十三斤、稻二千斤；该省潜江县龙湾乡龙心社的一点六亩养鱼稻田，平均亩产鱼四千七百一十三斤、稻三千零二斤，获得鱼稻双丰收。旅大水产养殖场马拴河养殖区的十九点五亩海带，平均亩产二万三千四百四十斤。福建平潭县塘屿渔业社的一亩紫菜，产四万二千斤。福建省晋江县英林乡嘉桃村集力农蚝社的十五点四亩牡蛎?，平均亩产四千四百三十二斤牡蛎肉，其中最高的五亩平均亩产六千五百六十二斤半，比去年广东宝安县沙井蚝业社亩产二千四百斤的全国最高纪录提高一倍多。现在还不到各种产品最后收成的时候，但完全可以肯定，新的更高的产量一定还会不断出现。
    捕捞网具和捕捞技术的显著改进和提高是今年我国水产事业大跃进的又一个特征。在今年春、夏两季鱼汛中，海洋捕捞生产获得很大的成绩。到8月底，全国已产海洋鱼类一百四十多万吨，接近去年全年总产量，这和改进捕捞网具、提高捕捞技术是分不开的。许多地区都推广了起锚、起网和人力推进器的滚珠轴承化，大大减轻了人力劳动，提高了工作效率和航速，增加了产量。加上今年沿海各省渔民都比往年提早一个月出海；暑天不休伏，继续进行作业，并在每次出海时都兼带几种网具，实行日捕夜张，有风拖网，无风站洋，夜间还利用灯光、电光诱捕鱼类，就使我国的水产品以跃进的速度发展起来。
    这些巨大成就是值得欢欣鼓舞的，但决不能因此骄傲自满和松劲。我们还要以比现在更高的速度来发展我国的水产生产，不断地创造奇迹。现在虽然鱼已在池中，其他养殖水生动植物，也正在良好地成长着，但要捕捞到手仍需作艰巨的努力。同时，为了明年水产生产的更大跃进，还要做好充分的准备工作。今年淡水养殖面积虽然成倍地扩大了，但和我国丰富的资源比较起来还是相差很远的：一亿亩淡水可养面积只利用了三分之一多；一千五百万亩海水可养面积也只利用了七分之一，还需要进一步发动群众，扩大放养，从海水到淡水，从内地到边疆，把一切可养殖的面积都利用起来。从单位产量看，现在各种高产卫星都已出现，最近召开的全国淡水、海水养殖、海洋捕捞生产现场会议，总结交流了各种先进经验。各地必须在大面积生产中推广这些经验，使各项生产普遍提高，总产量迅速增长。与大力发展海、淡水养殖的同时，还要增建船型大、航速快的渔轮和机帆船，把现有木帆船由人工操作逐步改为机械化或半机械化操作，增设现代化的科学航海仪器和电讯设备，继续进行现有船网的技术革新，提高海洋捕捞能力。
    发展水产对于改善人民生活、增加国家的资金积累和加速工农业生产的发展，都有重要的作用。我们党对于发展水产事业历来都是十分重视的。全国广大农村实现人民公社化以后，农、林、牧、副、渔的综合经济将得到更大的发展。今后凡有条件发展水产的县、乡、社都应当在当地党委的统一领导下，在综合经济规划中，做好渔业生产的安排，使水产生产更加高速度地发展起来。
