    Workers Propose
    To Strike the Enemy with Iron Fists
    The employees of the Yingkou County Commercial Bureau Smelting Plant held a meeting to support Premier Zhou's statement and resolutely protested the serious crime of the United States' armed aggression against our territory, Taiwan. At the meeting, with incomparable indignation, the employees unanimously expressed their determination to use practical actions to refine more steel and give the American aggressors a head-on blow. Gao Lujia Ziyuan, a blast furnace worker, said, "Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times, and we are determined to liberate it." The blast furnace workers immediately resolved to change the daily production quota of one ton of pig iron to one and a half tons, and challenged all workshops in the plant. The Dai Wanshan group produced more than 500 catties of pig iron that evening, increasing production efficiency by 29%.

    We are workers from the Yanzhou Engineering Section of the Jinan Railway Administration. When we heard about the new military provocations by American imperialism in our territory of Taiwan, we felt extremely angry.
    On the morning of September 6, we used five hours of voluntary labor to build a small earthen furnace. On September 7, we used another morning of voluntary labor to make the small earthen furnace produce the first batch of iron. Our seventy or so workers resolutely responded to the glorious task given to us by the Party, and guaranteed to overfulfill the glorious task of one ton of iron before "October 1st," using this practical action to enhance the power of the motherland and strike the aggressors!

At the same time, all the employees of the factory unanimously proposed: to successfully trial-produce the province's first gantry planer with a stroke of one zhang and a weight of fifteen tons, as well as thirteen other new products, and to guarantee the completion of the leap forward plan with practical actions, supporting the liberation of Taiwan.

    工人们提出
    要用钢铁拳头打击敌人
    我们营口县商业局冶炼厂的职工集会拥护周总理声明，坚决抗议美国武装侵略我国领土台湾的严重罪行。会上，职工们以无比的愤恨，一致表示要以实际行动炼出更多的钢铁，给美国侵略者以迎头痛击。高炉工人贾滋沅说：“台湾自古就是中国的领土，我们有决心解放它。”高炉职工当场决议，把日产生铁一吨的定额改为一吨半，并向全厂各车间挑战。戴万山小组那一天晚间就多出了五百多斤生铁，提高生产效率29％。
