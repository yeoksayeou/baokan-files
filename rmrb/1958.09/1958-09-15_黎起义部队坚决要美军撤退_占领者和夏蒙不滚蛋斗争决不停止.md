Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 14th – According to a report in today's "Guangming Bao," the headquarters of the Lebanese insurgent forces in Hermel and Baalbek, northeast of Beirut, wrote a letter to Lebanon's President-elect Shehab on the 13th, stating that the insurgent forces headquarters sincerely hopes to cooperate with the new President of Lebanon. However, the insurgent forces will never lay down their weapons and will continue to fight until the U.S. troops withdraw from Lebanon and Chamoun leaves the country.

Today, the "Guangming Bao" also published a recent letter from the Lebanese opposition's National Front to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld. The letter, signed by all members of the National Front, expresses their concern about the consequences of armed intervention carried out under the pretext of defending Lebanon – but in reality, defending traitors. They hope that their struggle will force the withdrawal of the American occupation forces from Lebanon. The letter also states that the rumored establishment of a UN police force is unacceptable.

The National Front also sent another letter to Hammarskjöld, condemning the nomination of Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik as a candidate for the presidency of the 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

According to a broadcast by the Voice of Free Lebanon radio station today, Lebanese opposition leader Salam said in Beirut on the 13th that there are two things they will never concede: the withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon and the formation of a new cabinet by opposition leader Karami. Opposition leader Jumblatt said that the opposition leaders will reject any incomplete solutions and insist on fully achieving their goals.

    黎起义部队坚决要美军撤退
    占领者和夏蒙不滚蛋斗争决不停止
    新华社大马士革14日电　据“光明报”今天报道，贝鲁特东北赫迈勒和巴尔贝克的黎巴嫩起义部队总部在13日写信给当选的黎巴嫩总统谢哈布说，起义部队总部真诚地希望同黎巴嫩新总统进行合作，但是起义部队决不会放下武器，并且将要继续进行斗争，直到美国军队撤出黎巴嫩和夏蒙离开这个国家为止。
    “光明报”今天还发表了黎巴嫩反对派民族阵线最近给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的一封信。这封由民族阵线全体人员签名的信表示，他们对于在保卫黎巴嫩的借口下——实际上是保卫卖国贼——所进行的武装干涉的后果感到不安。他们希望通过他们的斗争使美国占领军从黎巴嫩撤出。这封信又说，所传关于成立联合国警察部队的事是不能接受的。
    民族阵线还给哈马舍尔德另外一封信，谴责黎巴嫩外交部长马利克被提名为联合国大会第十三届会议主席的候选人。
    据自由黎巴嫩之声电台今天广播，黎巴嫩反对派领袖萨拉姆13日在贝鲁特说，有两件事情我们决不让步，那就是，美国军队从黎巴嫩撤退和由反对派领袖卡拉米组织新内阁。反对派领袖琼卜拉特说，反对派领袖们将拒绝任何不彻底的解决办法，他们坚持要完全实现他们的目标。
