Title: Hitting the Nail on the Head, Abuse Conceals Shame: Eisenhower Issues a Rogue Statement

Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd, Newport, Rhode Island: U.S. President Eisenhower, in a fit of pique, brazenly refused to accept the letter that Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, wrote to him on September 19th, demanding that the United States withdraw its troops from the Taiwan Strait area.

Clearly, because Khrushchev's letter, righteous in tone and stern in wording, hit the war maniacs where it hurt, Eisenhower resorted to the rogue tactic of refusing to accept the letter, disregarding basic international etiquette. On the same day, Eisenhower also instructed White House Press Secretary Hagerty to issue two statements approved by himself at the U.S. President's vacation headquarters in Newport. In these two statements, the American rulers went to great lengths to defend their aggressive stance, which had been condemned by people all over the world, and hysterically abused the Soviet Union. These two statements show that there can be no common language between the hundreds of millions of people and a handful of war maniacs, because that small group of war maniacs, filled with aggression, is indeed in a "topsy-turvy world."

The full text of the first White House statement is as follows:

"President Eisenhower received this morning from the American Embassy in Moscow the full text of a long letter from Chairman Khrushchev regarding the situation in the Far East.

This letter is full of false accusations, couched in harsh and impertinent language, it makes wanton personal attacks, and contains intolerable threats. Under international practice, all of this makes the letter unacceptable.

Therefore, the letter has been rejected and the American Chargé d'Affaires in Moscow has been instructed to return the letter to the Soviet government."

The full text of the second White House statement is as follows:

"The letter from Chairman Khrushchev, which was rejected by the President, concerns the serious situation in the Taiwan (Formosa) area that has arisen since the Chinese Communists launched an armed attack on August 23. Mr. Khrushchev demanded that the U.S. fleet and armed forces immediately withdraw from Taiwan (Formosa) and the adjacent waters and 'go home.'

He said that unless this is done, the Chinese Communists, supported by the Soviet Union, will have no choice but to 'drive out' the American troops.

Sadly, the Soviet Union, this military autocracy, supports the use of force to achieve expansionist goals.

The Charter of the United Nations stipulates that countries resolve their disputes by 'peaceful means.'

The United States is willing to do so and is in fact currently seeking a peaceful solution through ambassador-level talks in Warsaw. But negotiations are difficult under the current threats from the Soviet Union. We deeply regret the use of such threats. The United States considers the Soviet view strange and dangerous. There is no doubt that only in a 'topsy-turvy' world can it be said that the United States is cooperating with a friendly government purely for defense is 'aggression,' while the Soviet Union's guarantee to support the Chinese Communist regime's efforts to seize territory it has never exercised power over by force is a 'peaceful action.'"

    要害被击中　谩骂把羞遮
    艾森豪威尔发表无赖声明
    新华社22日讯　罗得岛新港消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔老羞成怒，在20日悍然拒绝接受苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫19日写给他的要求美国把它的军队撤出台湾海峡地区的信件。
    显然，由于赫鲁晓夫那封义正辞严的信件击中了战争狂人的要害，因此，艾森豪威尔就不顾起码的国际礼貌，采取了拒绝接受信件的无赖办法。同一天，艾森豪威尔还指令白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂在新港的美国总统的假期总部先后发表了由他自己批准的两个声明。在这两个声明中，美国统治者竭力为它遭到全世界人民谴责的侵略立场辩护，并对苏联进行了歇斯底里的谩骂。这两个声明表明：亿万人民大众同一小撮战争狂人之间是不可能有共同的语言的，因为，那一小撮满脑侵略的战争狂人确是处在“一个颠倒的世界中”。
    白宫的第一个声明全文如下：
    “艾森豪威尔总统今天上午从美国驻莫斯科大使馆方面接到赫鲁晓夫主席关于远东局势的一封长信的全文。
    这封信充满了错误的指责，措词刻薄而放肆，这封信恣意进行人身攻击，并且进行了不能容忍的威胁。在国际惯例下，所有这一切都使这封信是不能接受的。
    因此，这封信已被拒绝，并且已经指示美国驻莫斯科代办把这封信退回给苏联政府。”
    白宫的第二个声明全文如下：
    “赫鲁晓夫主席遭到总统拒绝的那封信是关于自从中国共产党人在8月23日发动武装进攻以来在台湾（福摩萨）地区所产生的严重局势的。赫鲁晓夫先生要求美国舰队和武装部队立即撤出台湾（福摩萨）和邻近的海面而‘回家’。
    他说，除非这样做，否则，得到苏联支持的中国共产党人除了把美国军队‘驱逐出去’以外别无其他办法。
    可悲的是，苏联这个军事专制国竟然支持使用武力来达到扩张主义的目的。
    联合国宪章规定各国用‘和平方法’来解决它们的争端。
    美国愿意这样做，并且事实上目前正在通过华沙的大使级会谈寻求和平解决办法。但是在苏联目前进行的这种威胁下很难进行谈判。我们对于使用这种威胁深表遗憾。美国认为苏联的观点奇怪而危险。毫无疑问，只有在一个‘颠倒的’世界中，才能说美国纯粹为了防御而同一个友好国家政府进行合作是‘侵略’，而苏联保证支持中国共产党政权努力用武力夺取它从来没有行使过权力的领土却是‘和平行动’。”
