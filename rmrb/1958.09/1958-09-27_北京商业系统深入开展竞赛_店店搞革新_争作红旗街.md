Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The stores on several major commercial centers in Beijing—Wangfujing, Xidan, Qianmen, Dashilar, Xinjiekou, and other streets—have undergone significant changes in their service appearance under the slogan of striving to become Red Banner Streets. More than 80 stores on Wangfujing Street have already been awarded red flags, and more than 80% of service personnel have been praised by customers. More than sixty stores on Guang'anmen Inner Street and Dashilar in Xuanwu District have been awarded red flags.

In addition to generally providing customers with initiative, enthusiasm, sincerity, and courtesy, the stores on these streets are also doing everything possible to facilitate customers. Industries such as department stores have changed their retail starting points. All commodities that can be sold by weight or in small portions are now broken down for retail. The service items of various stores have also been increased. For example, customers can buy small commodities, cigarettes, and candies at barber shops and bathhouses. Individual stores have implemented round-the-clock operations, so that people working night shifts can get wine and food and buy department store items in the middle of the night.

In order to realize the Red Banner Streets, many stores have broken down industry boundaries and are supporting and collaborating with each other. Employees in the department store and photography industries go to help in the food and breakfast shops that have fewer service personnel in the mornings when they are not busy. Bank employees sell stamps, magazines, and books on behalf of post offices and bookstores, while post office and bookstore employees handle savings deposits on behalf of banks.

In carrying out the work of Red Banner Streets, the work style of leaders at all levels in the commercial system has also undergone great changes, generally going to the masses to lead the masses to achieve the Great Leap Forward. Many leading cadres have planted "experimental plots" in stores, eating, living, and working with the masses, so that problems in commercial work that were difficult to solve in the past have been resolved.

    北京商业系统深入开展竞赛
    店店搞革新  争作红旗街
    新华社26日讯  北京市几个主要的商业中心——王府井、西单、前门、大栅栏、新街口等街道的商店，在争取成为红旗街的口号下，服务面貌已经有了很大的改变。王府井大街已有八十多家商店插上了红旗，80％以上的服务人员受到顾客的表扬。宣武区广安门内大街、大栅栏等商店有六十多个商店插上了红旗。
    这些大街的商店，除普遍主动热情、诚恳、有礼貌地接待顾客外，还千方百计便利顾客。百货等行业改变了零售起点，凡是能折斤破两、拆整卖零的商品，都拆开零售。各商店的服务项目也都有增加，如顾客到理发馆、到浴池都可以买到小百货、香烟、糖果。个别商店实行了通宵营业，做夜班的人在三更半夜也可以吃到酒饭，买到百货。
    为了实现红旗街，不少商店打破行业界限，互相支援互相协作。百货、照相行业的职工利用早晨业务不忙的时候，到服务人员少的副食行业和早点铺帮忙。银行的职工代邮局、书店卖邮票、杂志和书籍，邮局、书店的职工则代银行办理储蓄。
    在开展红旗街的工作中，商业系统各级领导干部的作风也有很大转变，普遍地到群众中去领导群众实现大跃进。很多领导干部在商店里种了“试验田”，和群众同吃同住同劳动，使商业工作中过去不好解决的问题得到了解决。
