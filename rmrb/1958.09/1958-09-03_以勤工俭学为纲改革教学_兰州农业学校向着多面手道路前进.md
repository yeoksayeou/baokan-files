Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, September 2nd: Lanzhou Agricultural School in Gansu Province, grasping work-study as the guiding principle, vigorously established factories and farms, carried out technical revolution and teaching reform, making the school full of vitality and advancing the teaching level a big step forward.

This spring, Lanzhou Agricultural School began to implement work-study. In addition to regularly participating in agricultural cooperative's voluntary labor, internships, and labor training, all teachers and students also established nineteen factories (farms) such as pig farms and bacterial fertilizer factories. These factories (farms) were all established in conjunction with the school's majors and existing conditions, with rapid construction and quick commencement of production. For example, one workshop of the bacterial fertilizer factory can now produce nine kinds of bacterial fertilizers, with a daily output of 10,000 catties.

In the process of work-study, the whole school has produced more than 500 kinds of relatively successful agricultural tool models. The plow they modified can plow deeper than 1.5 Chinese feet. The 72 research projects conducted by the faculty members have also yielded preliminary results. The cultivation of perennial wheat and flax has been pollinated and set seeds, and will be cultivated into new varieties that are drought-resistant, cold-resistant, high-yielding, and lodging-resistant.

Under the impetus of work-study, all teachers and students, based on the principle of combining politics and professional skills, and combining theory and practice, have carried out ten major reforms in teaching: 1. Change the national teaching syllabus to a regional teaching syllabus, correcting the tendency of the teaching syllabus to deviate from local production characteristics. 2. Change the simple imparting of book knowledge to combining with farmers' experience, advocating that the content of teaching materials should absorb farmers' practical experience and the province's experimental research and investigation summary data. 3. Change centralized internships to decentralized internships to meet the needs of agricultural affairs, changing the past practice of dividing the crop growth process and failing to grasp all the laws. 4. Change some classroom teaching to on-site explanations. 5. Change the chaotic and repetitive content of teaching materials to concise and essential. 6. Change the blind faith in book dogma to going deep into reality, with teachers and students taking turns going to agricultural cooperatives to conduct labor training and summarize production experience. 7. Change the internship farm into a teacher-student experimental field, making the internship farm a base for production, teaching, and scientific research. 8. Change full-day classes to half-day classes and half-day labor, with fewer classes during busy farming seasons and more classes during slack farming seasons, achieving half-work and half-study. 9. Change the examination method of reciting dogma and empty talk of theory to the examination method of combining theory with practice and learning combined with originality, with test questions closely related to production. 10. Change the empty talk of theory in political classes to strengthening the ideological transformation of students in connection with their actual thoughts. After such teaching reforms, the school's teaching has undergone great changes. Students with grades of four or above account for 82% of the total number of students.

　　以勤工俭学为纲改革教学
　　兰州农业学校向着多面手道路前进
    据新华社兰州2日电　甘肃省兰州农业学校抓起勤工俭学这个纲，大办工厂农场，大搞技术革命和教学改革，把学校办得生气勃勃，把教学水平向前推进了一大步。
    兰州农业学校今年春季开始实行勤工俭学，全校师生除了定期参加农业社义务劳动、实习和劳动锻炼以外，还开办了养猪场、细菌肥料厂等十九个工厂（场）。这些工厂（场）都是结合学校专业和现有条件办起来的，建设得快，投入生产也快。如细菌肥料制造厂一个车间现在已能生产九种细菌肥料，日产达万斤。
    在勤工俭学过程中，全校已经制作出比较成功的各种农具模型五百多种，经他们改装的步犁可以深耕一点五市尺以上。教职员们试验研究的七十二个项目，也都有了初步结果。多年生的小麦、胡麻的培育，已经授粉结实，将培育成为抗旱、抗寒、丰产、不倒伏的新品种。
    在勤工俭学的推动下，全校师生根据政治与业务相结合，理论与实践相结合的原则，在教学上进行了十大改革：一、改全国性的教学大纲为地区性的教学大纲，纠正教学大纲脱离本地生产特点的倾向。二、改单纯书本知识的传授为与农民经验相结合，提倡教材内容应吸收农民实践经验和本省试验研究及调查总结资料。三、改集中实习为适应农事需要的分散实习，改变过去分割作物生长过程不能掌握全部规律的实习办法。四、改某些课堂教学为现场讲解。五、改教材内容杂乱重复为精练扼要。六、改迷信书本教条为深入实际，师生轮流下农业社，进行劳动锻炼和总结生产经验。七、改实习农场为师生试验田，使实习农场成为生产、教学和科学研究的基地。八、改全日上课为半日上课、半日劳动，农忙时少上课，农闲时多上课，作到半工半读。九、改背诵教条、空谈理论的考试方法为理论联系实际、学习结合独创的考试方法，试题密切联系生产。十、改政治课空讲理论为联系学生思想实际，加强对学生的思想改造。经过这样的教学改革，学校教学面貌有很大改观。学生成绩四分以上的占总人数82％。
