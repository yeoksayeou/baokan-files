Labor Harvest Welcomes National Day

On August 13th, our great leader Chairman Mao came to Tianjin University for inspection and gave instructions. That evening, the students gathered to express their feelings about meeting the leader. At the meeting, some suggested responding to Chairman Mao's concern with redoubled labor enthusiasm; others proposed striving for greater achievements to meet Chairman Mao in Beijing. For example, the machine factory proposed, in addition to completing the production of one thousand lathes for external orders, to produce single-axis automatic lathes ahead of schedule. Under the encouragement of this enthusiasm, the third-year students of the welding major in the Department of Mechanical Engineering worked hard for twenty-seven days and have built a "Welding Rod Factory" with an annual output of approximately one thousand one hundred tons. A dozen second-year students of the internal combustion engine major in the Department of Mechanical Engineering are determined to produce a small motorcycle before National Day as a National Day gift. The teachers and students of the "Tianjin University Automobile Tractor Factory" are even more enthusiastic, and they are full of confidence in producing a streamlined sedan and a tractor before National Day to be sent to Beijing as gifts to Chairman Mao.

The teachers and students resolutely implemented the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results in their labor. For example, some factories lacked building materials and raw materials, so the students went everywhere to pick them up.

At present, according to incomplete statistics, the whole school has established more than 140 large, medium, and small factories, and about 60 have been put into production. All teachers and students have proposed to make a big revolution in technology, to run factories in a big way, and to produce more new products.

    劳动丰收迎国庆
    8月13日，伟大的领袖毛主席来到天津大学视察并作了指示。当天晚上，同学们纷纷集会发表会见领袖的感想。会上有人提出要用加倍的劳动热情来回答主席的关怀；有的提出要争取更大的成就上北京会见毛主席。如机工厂提出除完成给外面生产一千台车床外，还要提前生产出单轴自动车床。机系焊接专业三年级同学在这种热情鼓舞下，苦战二十七天，已经建成“焊条厂”，年产量约为一千一百吨。机系内燃机专业二年级十几个同学决心在国庆节前生产出一辆小型摩托车作为国庆献礼。“天津大学汽车拖拉机工厂”的师生们的热情更高，他们满怀信心地要在国庆节前生产出一辆流线型小轿车和一台拖拉机送到北京献给毛主席。
    师生们在劳动中坚决贯彻了多快好省的方针。如有些工厂缺乏建筑材料和原料，同学们便到处去拣。
    目前，据不完全的统计，全校已办大中小型工厂一百四十多个，投入生产的已有六十个左右。全体师生提出要大闹技术革命、大办工厂，要生产出更多的新产品。
