The experience of the China National Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation under the Ministry of Foreign Trade in mobilizing the masses to carry out the technical revolution movement proves that the experience of "combining the abstract with the concrete, using the abstract to drive the concrete" in the rectification campaign should continue to be promoted in future daily work. Through in-depth "abstract" discussions, this company has thoroughly broken down the "theory of conditions," and a new situation of rapid progress in various tasks has emerged.

More than a month ago, when the Animal By-Products Corporation concluded its rectification campaign and turned to mobilizing the masses to fully carry out the technical innovation movement, many people believed that the progress of animal by-products work had been relatively slow over the years, and it would be difficult to organize a leap forward in the future. Those who held this view mainly lacked enthusiasm for their own business, and therefore regarded some conditions that appeared to be "unfavorable" to the development of the animal by-products industry as unchangeable objective difficulties.

In view of the above situation, the leaders of the Animal By-Products Corporation recalled the experience of "using the abstract to drive the concrete" in the rectification campaign, and then decided to temporarily put aside all business work that could be delayed, and concentrate on mobilizing the masses to speak out freely and post big-character posters, delving into "abstract" discussions. In the process of these discussions, the company leaders also mobilized and organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's philosophical works and his ideological methods of observing things comprehensively and dialectically. After a period of concentrated "abstract" discussions, the thinking of leading cadres and the broad masses was further liberated, and those "unfavorable" conditions were now reversed into "favorable" conditions. For example, the fact that animal by-products were scattered in various places was originally seen as a difficult condition that "prevented the development of large-scale procurement work." Now, everyone believes that "scattering" precisely illustrates that animal by-products are closely related to the vital interests of the people of the whole country, especially the 500 million farmers, and is more conducive to mobilizing the entire people to engage in animal by-products. Although the fact that animal by-products are dirty and smelly is an objective reality, it is just like the "poverty and blankness" of China being a favorable condition for the revolution. As long as the masses are mobilized, people will be dissatisfied with the status quo of "dirty and smelly," and it will be easier to mobilize everyone to reform processing methods, change manual operation to mechanization, and make "dirty and smelly" a driving force for the great technical revolution.

After this in-depth "abstract" discussion and refutation of the theory of conditions, the thinking of all personnel underwent a complete change. Everyone realized that the animal by-products business is by no means an inferior industry isolated from the national and people's cause, but also a glorious revolutionary work that is "full of promise." With the liberation of thought, a large number of innovation proposals emerged. At this time, the company leaders, on the one hand, put forward the general direction of implementing the technological revolution in the animal by-products industry, and at the same time, based on the various innovation proposals for improving business operations, specifically calculated the details and put forward preliminary leap forward plans for 1958 and the Second Five-Year Plan period. When organizing all personnel to discuss the outline of the technological revolution and the leap forward plan for the entire animal by-products business, the company leaders further implemented the spirit of "from concrete to abstract, using the abstract to drive the concrete," and continued to call on everyone to "recognize the mainstream, dare to leap forward," and fight against the right-leaning conservative thinking of "fearing difficulties and not daring to leap forward." For example, this company, based on the needs of domestic sales and export, put forward a relatively large five-year leap forward target for the purchase of goatskins, which exceeded the original goat breeding figures in various places. At this time, some people believed that the leap forward target could not be achieved; some people suggested, based on the high goat breeding rate in Jining, Shandong, and the fact that local water and grass were insufficient, that a batch of breeding goats should be transferred from Shandong to four provinces with more water and grass to vigorously breed them. This alone could increase goat production by 16 million in five years. After consultation with the leading organs of relevant provinces, this proposal was not only immediately agreed to and supported, but it was also decided to take action immediately. The company leaders used this example to educate everyone in depth to truly recognize the situation of the great leap forward across the country and the vigorous efforts of various places, thus further encouraging everyone to carry forward the spirit of "dare to think and dare to do."

After more than 40 days of continuous struggle to liberate thought, this company has put forward nearly 200 important innovation measures in animal by-products procurement, processing, and export organization. Some of them have already begun to be implemented or have been initially tested successfully. They guarantee that the total value of animal by-products purchased nationwide will increase 20 times in five years, and that they will surpass all capitalist countries in export business and rank first in the world. One-third of the company's personnel have formed 12 armies to assist in the work of various provinces and cities, and all the personnel at home have also broken the boundaries of the original organizational structure of departments and sections, forming five shock groups. From managers to messengers and cooks, everyone is taking action. The battle cry they put forward is: "Completely collect everything that flies in the sky, buy everything that runs on the ground, travel all over the mountains, rivers, plains, and don't lose an inch of skin or a fraction of hair."

Many bold innovations and initiatives that no one dared to think of in the past are now appearing in large numbers. Two secretaries in the manager's office who had never asked about science and technology were inspired by the success of dyeing silk without dyes in Tianjin. They visited the Tianjin Dyeing and Weaving Factory and, after more than 30 stubborn and repeated experiments, finally succeeded in dyeing white rabbit skins and lambskins into beige and brown for the first time without dyes. This not only reduced the cost of dyeing by 50%, but also made the dyeing reliable, shiny, and improved the quality.

Not only the main business departments, but also all auxiliary departments have joined the ranks of the Great Leap Forward. The company's administrative managers, cooks, and messengers spent only a few days in July, without spending a penny of public funds, to set up a "Leap Forward Hotel" to provide a place for comrades who worked overtime at night to sleep.

    中国畜产公司大破保守思想
　　用整风方法推进技术革命
    本报讯　对外贸易部中国畜产公司发动群众开展技术革命运动的过程证明，整风中“虚实并举、以虚带实”的经验有必要在今后日常工作中继续发扬。这个公司通过深入“务虚”大破“条件论”，各项工作已出现势如破竹飞跃前进的新局面。
    一个多月以前，当畜产公司结束整风转入发动群众全面开展技术革新运动时，不少人曾经认为畜产工作历年来进展都比较缓慢，今后也很难组织跃进。持有这种看法的人，主要是由于他们对本行业务缺乏热爱，因而把某些表面看来对发展畜产事业“不利”的条件，看成是不可改变的客观困难。
    根据以上情况，畜产公司领导上回想起整风中“以虚带实”的经验以后，就下决心暂时放下一切可以缓办的业务工作，集中一段时间放手发动群众大鸣大放贴大字报，深入“务虚”。在务虚中，公司领导上并且动员和组织大家学习毛主席的哲学著作，学习毛主席全面观察事物和辩证地看问题的思想方法。经过一段时间的集中“务虚”，领导干部和广大群众的思想都进一步得到解放，原来那些“不利”条件现在都一反而为“有利”条件。譬如，原来畜产品零星分散各地，被人看做“不能开展大量收购工作”的困难条件，现在大家认为“零星分散”正说明畜产品同全国人民特别是五亿农民的切身利益密切相联，更加便利于发动全民搞畜产。畜产品又脏又臭虽是客观存在的情况，但是正同“一穷二白”是中国革命的有利条件一样，只要把群众发动起来，人们就会不满“又脏又臭”的现状，更容易动员大家改革加工方法，改手工操作为机械化，使“又脏又臭”成为大闹技术革命的动力。
    经过这场深入“务虚”，驳倒了条件论之后，全体人员的思想翻了个身，大家认识到畜产事业决不是甚么孤立于国家事业和全民事业之外的下等行业，而同样是一项“大有可为”的光荣的革命工作。随着思想的解放，大批革新建议就涌现出来。这时，公司领导上一方面提出在畜产事业方面实行技术革命的总的方向，同时根据大家提出的各项改进业务的革新建议具体算细账，分别提出1958年和第二个五年计划期间的初步跃进规划。在组织全体人员讨论整个畜产事业实行技术革命的纲要和跃进规划时，公司领导上又进一步贯彻“从实到虚，以虚带实”的精神，继续号召大家要“认识主流，敢于跃进”，同“害怕困难不敢跃进”的右倾保守思想作斗争。譬如，这个公司根据内销和出口需要提出收购山羊毛皮的五年跃进指标比较大，超过了各地原来的山羊繁殖数字。这时一部分人认为跃进指标无法实现；一部分人根据山东济宁的山羊繁殖率很高，而当地水草不多，每年不得不杀死一批种羊的情况，建议从山东调运大批种羊到四个水草较多的省大力繁殖，只此一项五年内就可以增产羊一千六百万只。这个建议经同有关省的领导机关商量后，不但马上得到同意和支持，并且决定立刻行动起来。公司领导上就利用这个事例深入教育大家要真正认识到全国大跃进的形势和各地的蓬勃干劲，因而更加鼓舞了大家进一步发扬“敢想敢做”的精神。
    经过四十多天来继续不断解放思想的斗争，这个公司已经在畜产品收购、加工、组织出口等方面提出近二百项重要的革新措施，有的已经开始实行或初步试验成功，他们保证五年内全国畜产品收购总值增长二十倍，在出口业务方面超过一切资本主义国家跃居世界第一位。公司里三分之一的人员已经组成十二路大军分赴各省市协助工作，所有在家人员也打破各处、科等原有组织机构的界限，组成五个突击组，上至经理下至通讯员、炊事员都全部行动起来。他们提出的战斗口号是：“天上飞的完全收，地下跑的都要买，山川平原全走遍，寸皮分毛都不丢。”
    许多过去从来没有人敢想的大胆革新和倡议，现在大量地出现了。经理室两位从来不过问科学技术的秘书同志，受到天津不用染料染丝绸成功的启发，他们访问了天津染织厂，经过三十多次顽强地反复试验，终于也第一次不用染料将白色的兔皮和羊羔皮染成米黄色和棕黄色。这样不但使染色成本降低50％，并且染色牢靠光泽，质量提高。
    不仅是主要业务部门，各个辅助部门也都卷入了大跃进的行列。这个公司的行政管理员、炊事员和通讯员同志们在7月里只花了几天时间，没有花公家一分钱，就办起了一个“跃进旅馆”，让夜里加班的同志有睡处。
