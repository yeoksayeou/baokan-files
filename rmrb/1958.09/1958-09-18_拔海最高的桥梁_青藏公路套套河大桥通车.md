Xinhua News Agency, Xining, September 17th: The Tuotuo River Bridge on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, spanning the uppermost reaches of the Yangtze River, was completed in August and recently held an opening ceremony.

　　This reinforced concrete bridge is 273.56 meters long and is built over the Tuotuo River at an altitude of 4,500 meters, making it the highest bridge above sea level in the world. Despite the high altitude, poor natural conditions, and rapidly changing climate, the workers completed the bridge more than ten days ahead of schedule in just over four months. The quality meets the design requirements, and the project cost was reduced by 29.6%.

    拔海最高的桥梁
    青藏公路套套河大桥通车
    新华社西宁17日电　横跨长江最上游的青藏公路套套河大桥，已在8月竣工，最近举行了通车典礼。
    这座钢筋混凝土桥，全长二百七十三点五六公尺，架设在拔海四千五百公尺的套套河上，是世界上拔海最高的桥梁。在海拔高、自然条件差、气候瞬息万变的条件下，职工们只用四个多月的时间提前十多天就建成了这座桥梁，质量合乎设计要求，工程费用节约了29.6％。
