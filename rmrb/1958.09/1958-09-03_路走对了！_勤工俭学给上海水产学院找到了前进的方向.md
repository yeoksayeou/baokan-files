The Road is Right!
——Work-Study Program Shows Shanghai Fisheries College the Way Forward
By Chen Xiangdong, Our Correspondent

"A little labor is worth more than ten years of study." This is a common sentiment shared by teachers and students of Shanghai Fisheries College who participated in work-study programs and down-to-the-countryside labor. The work-study program has provided a direction for the advancement of the Fisheries College, and now no one in the college doubts or opposes this policy.

Before implementing this policy, the college went through some twists and turns and serious ideological struggles. Since its expansion in 1952 on the basis of the original Wusong Fisheries Vocational School, although it has achieved certain results in teaching and scientific research, it has long lacked a clear direction for teaching, scientific research, and teacher training goals. The teachers generally held ideas that valued professional work over politics, theory over practice, mental labor over physical labor, and intellectuals over workers and peasants. Under the control of these ideas, teachers only lectured and did not supervise experiments; lacking teaching materials, they did not go to the actual practice to investigate and research, collect materials, but instead compiled them behind closed doors, and regardless of whether the materials from foreign countries, especially Japan, were suitable for China's actual conditions, they pieced them together and copied them rigidly. In terms of teacher training routes and methods, they only relied on reading and further study, and were unwilling to go down to factories, ships, and fishing grounds, and were unwilling to learn from fishermen. Due to being divorced from reality, topics for scientific research and graduation design papers were often not proposed, and even if they were, they were built behind closed doors and did not meet the needs. The Department of Marine Fisheries could not design nets and fishing gear suitable for the specific conditions of China's fishing areas, and the teachers of the Department of Aquatic Product Processing could not even make ordinary edible fish balls. A lecturer in the Department of Aquaculture was very knowledgeable in identifying fish fry, but could not distinguish the fish fry in the department's own breeding farm. Due to the separation of teaching ideology from reality and politics, graduates lacked practical production knowledge and technology, and also lacked professional ideas, and were unwilling to be assigned to work in the aquatic product sector.

Through the Two-Anti Movement and special discussions and debates on the issue of work-study programs, all teachers and students in the college generally realized deeply that the fundamental contradiction of the school was the separation of theory from practice and the separation of teaching from production, and that implementing work-study programs was the only correct way to solve this contradiction. Subsequently, each department and teaching and research group, under the slogan of "facing production, facing the ocean," went in batches to various fishing areas along the coast of Zhejiang, Haifeng in Guangdong, Wuhan, and Baiyangdian fish fry breeding farms in Hebei, aquatic product processing factories of aquatic product companies in Zhejiang and Shanghai, to work and train, investigate and research, summarize experiences, and conduct scientific research work.

Through labor and contact with reality, the mental outlook of teachers and students has rapidly undergone profound changes. Wang Jiayu, a lecturer in the Department of Aquaculture, went to Zhejiang to investigate what fish fry were available in the Xin'an River and whether fish could be raised after the Xin'an River Reservoir was built and stored water. Their work received enthusiastic help from local relevant departments and the masses of fishermen. The fishermen introduced in detail the types, forms, habits, and movements of fish, so that they obtained a lot of material that could not be obtained from books and laboratories. He said that this proves that fishermen are knowledgeable and are practical scientists. Now, he not only realizes the necessity of learning from the masses of fishermen, but also believes that the method of learning is not to find fishermen to go to Shanghai, but to go to the fishermen, and live and work with them. Feng Zhizhe, an assistant teacher in the Department of Processing, who worked in the refrigeration workshop of the Hangzhou Meat United Processing Plant, had been in school for five years, and he still knew something about the components of the refrigerator but did not know why. This time, he worked in the factory, installing and dismantling them, and he figured it out in only two weeks. He said: "After labor practice, I feel more deeply the seriousness of being divorced from reality in the past, and now my confidence in participating in physical labor and work-study programs has become even stronger." Students of the Department of Aquaculture who went to various breeding farms for labor practice and saw the rapid development of fish farming in various places, and the great interest and enthusiasm of farmers in fish farming, with fish fry in short supply, completely changed their past thinking that fish farming was unpromising and that they were not at ease with the aquaculture profession.

Facing production and facing the ocean have also brought a new atmosphere to the school's scientific research work, not only making the research content closely integrated with production, but also greatly expanding the scope of research. Cheng Yuzhou and Xu Yufen, young teachers of the Department of Processing Technology Teaching and Research Group, and technician Lu Heqing, in the process of participating in labor in the fish cannery, found that fish body cutting was all manual operation, the labor intensity was high, the production efficiency was low, and the fish pieces were not cut neatly, so they jointly researched and developed China's first fish body cutting machine, which can cut 3,600 fish per hour, which is 30 times more efficient than manual operation. The Department of Marine Fisheries originally planned to complete the research on the "universal fishing net" in three years. The teachers and students of the department's industrial fishing teaching and research group, based on their actual observations on the ship, deeply felt that the currently used general fishing nets cannot rise and fall with the rise and fall of fish schools, which seriously affects the amount of fish caught. In just one week, they quickly completed the design and trial production of the "universal fish net" that can go up and down with the fish schools. In the past, the Department of Processing was unwilling to study the problem of puffer fish poisoning that has long existed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces. After the direction was clarified, they immediately started research experiments, and have achieved certain results so far. The anesthetic extracted from puffer fish toxin is about to be used for clinical experiments. Through investigation and research on the Qiantang River and Zhoushan sea, the Department of Aquaculture has listed problems that were not valued in the past or even considered not worth studying, such as freshwater fish farming, large-scale water area fish farming, kelp transplantation, and artificial incubation of reeves shad to prevent continued decline in production, as key research topics. Lu Gui, the deputy director of the department, said: In the past, sitting in school and relying solely on subjective imagination, it was often impossible to come up with topics. Now, as soon as we go out, we find that there are many problems in production. There are more than 20 topics that urgently need to be researched and solved in large-scale water areas (such as Taihu Lake and Qiantang River) alone.

In order to further ensure that the goals of teaching, scientific research, and teacher training are completely consistent with the needs of production, in addition to strengthening the attached factory of the school and strengthening ties with relevant departments in Shanghai to continue to implement work-study activities, the college has recently established cooperative relations with Zhoushan Fishing Area, one of the largest fishing areas in China, as a key point for regular contact with production practice. At a recent symposium of teachers and students returning from work-study programs held by the college, everyone was in high spirits and full of confidence, and unanimously stated: The road facing production and facing the ocean is the right one!

    路走对了！
　　——勤工俭学给上海水产学院找到了前进的方向
    本报记者　陈向东
    “劳动不多日，胜读十年书”。这是上海水产学院参加勤工俭学和下放劳动的师生，在亲身参加劳动后所得出的一条共同的体会。勤工俭学给水产学院提供了前进的方向，现在这个学院的师生，对于这个方针，再也没有人表示怀疑和反对了。
    这个学院在实行这个方针之前，是经过一些曲折的道路和严重的思想斗争的。自1952年在原吴淞水产专科学校的基础上扩建以来，虽然教学和科学研究都有一定的成绩，但由于对教学、科学研究和师资培养目标，长期缺乏明确的方针，教师中普遍存在着重业务轻政治、重理论轻实践、重脑力劳动轻体力劳动、重知识分子轻工农的思想，在这些思想支配下，教师只管讲课，不管辅导实验；缺乏教材，不是到实际中调查研究，搜集材料，而是关门编写，对来自外国尤其是日本的材料，不管是否适合中国的实际情况，也东拼西凑，硬搬硬套。在师资培养路线和方法上，只靠读书进修，不愿下厂下船下渔场，不愿向渔民学习。由于脱离实际，科学研究的题目和毕业设计论文往往提不出来，即使提出来，也是闭门造车，不合需要。海洋渔业系不会设计适合于我国渔区具体情况的网和渔具，水产加工系的教师甚至不会做普通食用的鱼丸子，养殖系的一位讲师讲鉴别鱼苗头头是道，可是却辨不清本系养殖场里的鱼苗。由于教学思想上的脱离实际和脱离政治，毕业学生既缺乏实际生产知识和技术，又缺乏专业思想，不愿分配到水产部门工作。
    通过双反运动和对勤工俭学问题的专题鸣放和辩论，全院师生才普遍深刻地认识到理论脱离实际，教学脱离生产，是学校的根本矛盾，而实行勤工俭学则是解决这个矛盾的唯一正确的道路。接着各系各教研组便在“面向生产，面向海洋”的口号下，分批到浙江沿海各渔区、广东海丰、武汉和河北白洋淀的鱼苗养殖场、浙江和上海市的水产公司加工厂，一面劳动锻炼，一面调查研究，总结经验，并进行科学研究工作。
    通过劳动和接触实际，师生的精神面貌迅速发生了深刻的变化。养殖系讲师王嘉宇等到浙江调查新安江有什么鱼苗，新安江水库建成蓄水后能不能养鱼等情况。他们的工作得到了当地有关部门和渔民群众热情帮助，渔民们详细地介绍鱼的种类、形态、习性和移动情况，使他们得到了许多从书本上和实验室里得不到的材料。他说，这证明渔民是有知识的，他们是实际的科学家，现在不仅体会到向渔民群众学习的必要，而且认为学习的方法，不是把渔民找到上海去，而是要到渔民那里去，同他们一起生活和劳动。到杭州肉类联合加工厂冷藏车间劳动的加工系助教冯志哲，过去在校五年，对冷冻机的构件，还有些知其然而不知其所以然，这次在工厂劳动，又装又拆，只两个星期就搞清楚了。他说：“经过劳动实践，更感到过去脱离实际的严重，现在对参加体力劳动和勤工俭学的信心也就更加强了。到各地养殖场劳动实习的养殖系学生，看到各地养鱼事业飞跃发展，农民对养鱼的兴趣和干劲很大，鱼苗供不应求，彻底转变了他们过去认为养鱼事业没出息，不安心养殖专业的思想。
    面向生产，面向海洋，也给学校的科学研究工作带来了一番新气象，不仅研究内容密切与生产结合，研究的范围也大大扩大了。加工系工艺学教研组青年教师程郁周、徐毓芬和技工陆和清，在参加鱼罐头厂劳动过程中，发觉鱼体切块都是手工操作，劳动强度高，生产效率低，鱼块也切不整齐，便共同研究，结果制成了我国第一架鱼体切块机，每小时可切鱼三千六百条，比手工操作提高效率三十倍。海洋渔业系对“万能捕鱼网”的研究，原订三年完成，该系工业捕鱼教研组的师生，根据他们在船上的实际观察，深刻的感到现用的一般鱼网不能随着鱼群的升降而升降，影响捕鱼量的严重性，在短短的一周内，就突击完成了可以随着鱼群的上下而上下的“万能鱼网”的设计和试制工作。加工系过去对江苏、浙江等省长期存在的河豚鱼中毒问题不愿研究，方向明确后，立即动手研究实验，到目前已取得一定成就，从河豚鱼毒素中提炼出的麻醉剂，即将用于临床实验。养殖系通过在钱塘江和舟山海面上的调查研究，把过去不大重视甚至认为不值得研究的淡水养鱼、大型水域养鱼、海带移殖以及鲥鱼人工孵卵防止继续减产等问题，都列为重点研究的题目。这个系的副主任陆桂同志说：过去坐在学校，单凭主观想像，往往想不出题目，现在一出门，发现生产中问题很多，单是大型水域（如太湖、钱塘江）养鱼方面，就有二十多个题目迫切需要研究解决。
    为了进一步使教学、科学研究和师资培养的目标完全同生产需要相一致，该院除在本校附属工厂，并与上海市的有关部门加强联系，继续贯彻勤工俭学活动外，最近又同我国最大的渔区之一——舟山渔区，建立了协作关系，作为经常联系生产实际的一个重点。在该院最近举行的一次勤工俭学归来的师生座谈会上，大家情绪高涨，信心充足，一致表示：面向生产，面向海洋的路算是走对了！
