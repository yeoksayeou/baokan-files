Hoisting High the Red Flag of Labor to Greet National Day

Toiling Ten Days and Nights: Compiling a Great Dictionary

More than 300 faculty and students from the Institute of International Relations, through great collaboration, and under the leadership of the Party committee, toiled for ten days and nights, and compiled a World Knowledge Dictionary with 4,000 entries and 800,000 words, as a gift to the "Eleventh" National Day.

This is a reference book to help readers understand and learn international knowledge and read newspapers and periodicals. The content includes several major categories such as international politics, economics, and science and culture, including important political parties of various countries, international events, international organizations, international documents, personal names, place names, newspapers, news agencies, monopoly organizations, races, languages, religions, and international common sense terminology.

Originally, experts estimated it would take about a year to compile this dictionary, but they promoted the spirit of communist collaboration. Party committee leaders, teachers, and students of all grades participated in this work. They went to many units such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Institute of International Relations, the Xinhua News Agency, and the World Knowledge Publishing House to collect data, and divided the work to compile it. This was the first time that students participated in compiling a dictionary, and there were many difficulties. They established "Assault Teams" and "Tough Nut to Crack Teams" to specifically tackle difficult problems, and finally completed all the work in a short period of time. In participating in the compilation of this dictionary, the students not only shattered the superstition that only experts can compile dictionaries, but also learned a lot of new knowledge.

This dictionary has now been sent to the World Knowledge Publishing House and will be published soon.

    高举劳动红旗迎国庆
    苦战十昼夜编成大辞典
    国际关系学院三百多师生大协作，在党委领导下，苦战十昼夜，编出了一本有四千条目八十万字的世界知识辞典，向“十一”国庆节献礼。
    这是一本帮助读者了解和学习国际知识、阅读报刊的工具书。内容包括国际政治、经济和科学文化几大类，其中有各国重要党派、国际事件、国际组织、国际文件、人名、地名、报刊、通讯社、垄断组织、种族、语言、宗教及国际常识术语等。
    这本辞典原来专家们要一年左右才能编成，但他们发扬了共产主义大协作的精神，党委领导、教师和各年级学生都参加了这一工作。他们分头到外交部、国际关系研究所、新华通讯社和世界知识出版社等许多单位收集资料，并分工编写。学生们参加编写辞典还是第一次，困难是很多的，他们成立了“攻坚小组”、“啃骨头小组”等，专门攻难题，终于在短时期内完成了全部工作。学生们在参加编写这本辞典中，不仅破除了只有专家才能编辞典的迷信，而且也学到了许多新的知识。
    现在这部辞典已送交世界知识出版社，不久即将出版。
