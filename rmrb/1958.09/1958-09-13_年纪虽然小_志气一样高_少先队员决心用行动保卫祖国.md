Although Young in Age, Their Aspirations Are Just as High
Young Pioneers Determined to Defend the Motherland with Action
    We are a group of Young Pioneers. We absolutely cannot tolerate the fact that American imperialism wants to destroy our happy life!

    When our whole class read in the newspaper about the students of Jiangtou Town Third Middle School being massacred by the robbers' artillery fire while they were in class, we were all inflamed with anger. We thought: They, like us, all have their own ideals and want to contribute to the motherland, but now they cannot enter a happier socialist and communist society with us.... At that time, many students couldn't help but shout slogans. Some students said: "Although I am young, my aspirations are high. When I am needed to take up a gun, I will be as brave as the 'Red Boy'!"

    Afterwards, our whole class lined up and went to the Party branch office to solemnly swear to the Party:

    1. We will demonstrate against American imperialism;
    2. We will do whatever the motherland needs us to do to liberate Taiwan;
    3. Everything we do must also be collectivized, militarized, and combat-ready;
    4. We are determined to make our class the most outstanding Red Scarf class in the country. When we reach junior high school, we will all be fifteen years old, and we will strive to join the Communist Youth League together.

            All fifty-two Young Pioneers of the First and Second Classes of Beijing No. 8 Middle School

    年纪虽然小　志气一样高
    少先队员决心用行动保卫祖国
    我们是一群少先队员，美帝国主义要破坏我们的幸福生活，我们绝对不能容忍！
    当我们全班读报读到江头镇第三中学正在上课的同学被强盗的炮火屠杀的时候，我们个个都被激愤得冒起火来了。我们想：他们和我们一样，都有自己的理想，都想为祖国贡献力量，但是，现在他们不能和我们一道进入更加幸福的社会主义社会和共产主义社会了……。当时许多同学都忍不住喊起了口号。有的同学说：“我虽然年岁小，可是志气高，需要我拿枪杆时，我一定会像‘红孩子’一样地勇敢！”
    随后，我们全班整队到党支部办公室，向党庄严的宣誓：
    1、我们要向美帝国主义示威；
    2、祖国需要我们为解放台湾做什么我们就做什么；
    3、我们的一切也要作到集体化、军事化、战斗化；
    4、决心把我们班搞成全国最优秀的红领巾班。到初三时我们全班都十五岁，要争取一起加入共青团。
            北京八中初一、二班　全体五十二名少先队员
