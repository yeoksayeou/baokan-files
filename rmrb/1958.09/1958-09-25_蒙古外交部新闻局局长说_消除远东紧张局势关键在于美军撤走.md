Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, September 24th: The Director of the Information Bureau of the Mongolian Foreign Ministry, Tserenchoidorj, told Xinhua reporters today that the Mongolian people and the Mongolian government fully support Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi's stern rebuttal of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's speech at the United Nations General Assembly.

Tserenchoidorj said that the Mongolian people and the Mongolian government believe that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement comprehensively clarified the situation in the Taiwan Strait area and exposed the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism. This statement is a historic document that paves the way for eliminating the current tension in the Far East.

Tserenchoidorj said that U.S. imperialism must never be allowed to send troops to invade Chinese territory thousands of miles away from the United States. He said that this is a blatant act that violates the norms of international law. He said that the Mongolian people angrily condemn Dulles for using the United Nations platform to cover up the United States' aggressive behavior. Dulles's talk of "ceasefire" and other fallacies are nothing more than attempts to deceive world opinion. Tserenchoidorj pointed out that the key to eliminating the current tension in the Far East lies in the immediate withdrawal of U.S. aggressor troops from the Taiwan Strait area, and there is no question of a "ceasefire" at all. He said that the position taken by the Mongolian People's Government on this issue is completely consistent with Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement.

Tserenchoidorj said that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands and the punishment of the Chiang Kai-shek clique are entirely China's internal affairs. He said that if U.S. imperialism does not stop its armed provocations against China, does not withdraw its invading troops from Chinese territory, and dares to launch a war despite China's solemn warnings and the resolute opposition of world opinion, then the powerful force of 600 million Chinese people is fully capable of crushing any act of aggression.

He said that the Mongolian people firmly stand with the great neighbor, the Chinese people, and resolutely support the just struggle of the Chinese people.

    消除远东紧张局势关键在于美军撤走
    新华社乌兰巴托24日电  蒙古外交部新闻局局长策仁朝德勒今天对新华社记者说，蒙古人民和蒙古政府完全支持中国外交部长陈毅严正驳斥美国国务卿杜勒斯在联合国大会上发言的声明。
    策仁朝德勒说，蒙古人民和蒙古政府认为，陈毅外长的声明全面地阐明了台湾海峡地区的局势，揭穿了美帝国主义的侵略面目。这个声明是一个为消除目前远东紧张局势开辟道路的历史性文件。
    策仁朝德勒说，决不容许美帝国主义调兵遣将来侵犯离开美国几千浬的中国领土，他说，这是违反国际法准则的粗暴行为。他说，蒙古人民愤怒地谴责杜勒斯利用联合国讲台来掩饰美国的侵略行为，杜勒斯说什么“停火”等谰言，无非是为了欺骗世界舆论。策仁朝德勒指出，消除目前远东紧张局势的关键在于美国侵略军立即从台湾海峡地区撤退，根本不发生什么“停火”问题。他说，蒙古人民政府在这个问题上所采取的立场同陈毅外长的声明是完全一致的。
    策仁朝德勒说，中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿和给蒋介石集团以惩罚完全是中国的内政问题。他说，如果美帝国主义不停止对中国的武装挑衅，不从中国领土上撤退它的侵略军队，不顾中国的严正警告和世界舆论的坚决反对而胆敢发动战争的话，那末，六亿中国人民的强大力量完全能够粉碎任何侵略行为。
    他说，蒙古人民坚决同伟大的邻邦中国人民站在一起，并且坚决支持中国人民的正义斗争。
