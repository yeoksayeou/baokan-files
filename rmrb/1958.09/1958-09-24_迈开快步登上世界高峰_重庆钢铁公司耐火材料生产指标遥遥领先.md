Taking Big Strides to Ascend the World Peak
Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's Refractory Material Production Indicators Far Ahead

(Our newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd) The production level of refractory materials at the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has taken rapid strides, ascending to a world peak. In the recent six months, this company has completely overturned its old technical regulations from beginning to end, establishing a complete set of advanced operating methods. It has reached and exceeded world advanced levels in many important technologies, such as rapid kiln firing, rapid cooling, the output of large grinding mills for crushing raw materials, the processing of magnesia bricks, and the non-kiln firing of clay bricks. The company's refractory material output in August was 13% higher than the total output in the first quarter of this year. The planned output for September will be more than four times the average monthly output in the first quarter, making it a red banner in China's refractory material industry.

Among the national iron and steel enterprises, the production equipment of refractory materials at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company is not advanced, and its technical strength is also weak. Most of the operations in the refractory material workshop are manual, and in terms of technical strength, there is only one engineer and one technician. The workshop director was promoted from the ranks of the workers. It is not only not comparable to the modern refractory material production equipment and strong technical strength possessed by Anshan Iron and Steel and Taiyuan Iron and Steel, but it is also inferior to refractory material factories such as Benxi and Guye. This year, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's production and construction have both leapt forward rapidly, with steel and steel material output doubling that of last year. The original small iron and steel complex will be expanded into a modern large-scale iron and steel complex in a little over a year. In addition, dozens of units across the country are waiting for Chongqing Iron and Steel Company to support them with refractory materials. All aspects require the company to double its production of refractory materials.

Faced with such an acute contradiction, the company and workshop leadership decided to mobilize and rely on the masses to change the production outlook of the workshop. During the rectification movement, the workshop's Party general branch criticized the conservative thinking of some people who believed that the equipment was backward and lacked confidence. It called on the workers to break superstitions, liberate their minds, and boldly challenge the old technical regulations that restricted production development. At the same time, workshop leaders also went deep into the work sections to cultivate experimental plots and work alongside the workers. Since March this year, this workshop has continuously created miracles in production.

In the past, the kiln firing time for clay bricks was sixty to eighty hours, accounting for most of the entire refractory material production process. Clay bricks accounted for 70% of the company's total refractory material output. They learned from the experience of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 Steelmaking Plant and discovered that the old technical regulations were very unreasonable. For example, when firing a kiln, it was necessary to heat according to a "temperature rise curve." This technical theory, which was considered sacred and inviolable by capitalist countries, rigidly stipulated the heating method, requiring slow heating according to the prescribed "curve," otherwise the refractory bricks would crack. Therefore, the kiln firing time was prolonged. They tried to increase firepower and temperature as much as possible during kiln firing. Experiments proved the success of rapid kiln firing, and the refractory bricks not only did not crack, but also had good quality. They overturned the old method, and the kiln firing time for clay bricks quickly decreased, and they broke the kiln firing records of various countries in the world several times in a row.

The use of advanced alkaline refractory materials, such as magnesia bricks and alumina-magnesia bricks, in the metallurgical industry is a new development in the international arena in the last two or three decades. Since Chongqing Iron and Steel Company started production in 1956, it has been consistently discarding entire kilns of product because of the low quality of raw materials and the high calcium oxide content in the magnesia sand. Many countries treat magnesia sand by using the "smothering mud" method to remove calcium oxide. Because the magnesia sand used by Chongqing Iron and Steel Company had too high a calcium oxide content, this method could not meet the needs of production. This year, they boldly explored a closed-vaporization method, turning the inferior magnesia sand, which other factories believed could not even be used for sintering open-hearth furnace bottoms, into high-grade refractory materials such as magnesia bricks and alumina-magnesia bricks, with a quality that even greatly exceeded the British level. This important achievement made an important technical contribution to the development of high-grade refractory materials in our country. At this year's National Refractory Materials Conference, Chinese and Soviet experts unanimously gave a high evaluation to this important achievement. After many unreasonable and outdated technical regulations were destroyed, the production level of the entire workshop rose rapidly. In the past, large round kilns with a capacity of 180 tons could only be cycled about four times a month, but now they have reached at least seven or eight times. Small round kilns have also increased from four or five cycles per month in the past to more than ten times, greatly exceeding the production efficiency of general domestic round kilns and leaping to the advanced international level.

After the production level of the workshop was comprehensively improved, the Party general branch continued to educate workers with the spirit of continuous revolution, constantly put forward new battle slogans, organized workers to create higher production levels, and advanced towards new goals. After the kiln workers shortened the average kiln firing time for clay bricks to more than ten hours, they continued to improve operating methods. Following the creation of a world record of 9 minutes and 40 seconds to fire a kiln in June, they continuously created newer records of 7 minutes and 10 seconds and 6 minutes and 20 seconds to fire a kiln well in August and September. The average kiln firing time has been shortened to about ten hours. Although the output of 100 tons per shift from the large grinding mill has been praised by many steel plants across the country, they recently proposed to advance towards 180 tons and 200 tons per shift. The actual output has reached a maximum of 150 tons. In order to provide more refractory materials for steel production, workshop employees even successfully tested the major technology of non-kiln firing of clay bricks in August. Although there is no theoretical basis for non-kiln firing of clay bricks, with the support of the workshop's Party general branch, the employees changed the binder for brick making. After more than ten experiments, the refractory temperature of clay bricks without kiln firing reached over 1600 degrees Celsius, and the strength and other quality indicators were fully qualified. More than 23,000 tons have already been produced from January to August this year. Recently, they once again revised the original leap-forward plan to produce 63,000 tons of bricks this year, striving to produce 72,000 tons to meet the needs of production and construction.

    迈开快步登上世界高峰
    重庆钢铁公司耐火材料生产指标遥遥领先
    本报重庆23日电　重庆钢铁公司耐火材料的生产水平已经迈开快速的步伐，登上了世界高峰。最近半年来这个公司从头到尾地推翻了过去的一套陈旧技术规程，建立了全套先进操作方法，在快速烧窑、快速冷却、粉碎原料的大干碾机产量、镁砖加工、粘土砖不烧窑等许多重要技术上，都达到和超过了世界先进水平。8月份这个公司耐火材料产量比今年第一季度全部产量还多13％。9月份计划产量将超过了第一季度平均月产量四倍以上，是我国耐火材料工业中的一面红旗。
    在全国钢铁企业中，重庆钢铁公司耐火材料的生产设备并不先进，技术力量也很弱。耐火材料车间大部分是人工操作，技术力量方面只有一个工程师和一个技术员，车间主任是由工人提拔起来的。它不仅不能和鞍钢、太原钢铁公司等所拥有的现代化耐火材料生产设备和强大技术力量相比，就是比较本溪、古冶等耐火材料厂也不如。今年重庆钢铁公司生产和建设都跃进很快，钢和钢材产量比去年增加了一倍，原来的小型钢铁联合企业要在一年多内扩建成为现代化的大型钢铁联合企业，另外全国还有几十个单位等着重庆钢铁公司支援耐火材料，各个方面都要求这个公司加倍提高耐火材料的生产。
    针对这样一个尖锐的矛盾，公司和车间领导决定发动、依靠群众来改变车间生产面貌。在整风运动中，车间党总支批判了有些人认为设备落后，信心不足的保守思想，号召职工破除迷信，解放思想，大胆向约束生产发展的陈旧技术规程挑战，车间领导干部同时也深入到工段上去种试验田，和工人一起劳动。从今年3月以来，这个车间生产上就不断创造出奇迹。
    过去粘土砖的烧窑时间要六十小时到八十小时，占了耐火材料整个生产过程的大部分时间。粘土砖在这个公司耐火材料总产量中要占70％，他们从学习重庆钢铁公司第二炼钢场的经验中发现过去的技术规程很不合理。例如烧窑时一定要根据“升温曲线”加温。这个被资本主义各国公认为神圣不可侵犯的技术理论，把加温方法规定得很死板，一定要根据规定的“曲线”慢慢加温，否则耐火砖就要开裁。因此烧窑时间拉得很长。他们在烧窑中尽量加大火力和提高温度，经过实验证明快速烧窑的成功经验，耐火砖不仅没有开裁，而且质量很好，推翻了旧的方法，粘土砖烧窑时间迅速下降，并且连续几次打破了世界各国的烧窑纪录。
    冶金工业中采用高级碱性耐火材料——镁砖、铝镁砖等是国际上最近二、三十年来的新发展。重庆钢铁公司从1956年开始生产以来，一直因为所用原料质量低，镁砂中含氧化钙成份过高经常整窑整窑地报废。许多国家处理镁砂都是用“焖泥”的办法除去氧化钙。重庆钢铁公司因为所用镁砂含氧化钙过高，用这种办法满足不了生产的要求。今年他们大胆摸索出了密闭汽化的办法，把其他工厂认为烧结平炉炉底都不能用的劣质镁砂制成了镁砖、铝镁砖等高级耐火材料，质量还大大超过了英国水平。这一重要成就为我国发展高级耐火材料作了一个重要技术贡献。在今年全国耐火材料会议上，中苏专家一致给予这一重要成就以很高评价。许多不合理的陈旧技术规程被摧毁以后，全车间生产水平就飞快上升。过去产量一百八十吨的大圆窑每月只能周转四次左右，现在最低都已达到七、八次；小圆窑也从过去每月周转四、五次提高到十次以上，大大超过国内一般圆窑的生产效率而跃进到国际上的先进水平。
    车间生产水平全面提高以后，党总支又以不断革命精神教育工人，不断提出新的战斗口号，组织工人创造更高生产水平，向新的目标前进。烧窑工人在粘土砖的平均烧窑时间缩短到十多小时以后，继续改进操作方法，继6月份创造九点四十分钟烧成一窑的世界纪录后，8、9月份又连续创造了七点十分钟、六点二十分钟烧好一窑的更新纪录，平均烧窑时间已缩短到十小时左右。大干碾机每班产量达到一百吨以后虽然受到了全国许多钢铁厂的赞扬，最近他们又提出来要向班产一百八十吨和二百吨进军，实际产量最高已达到一百五十吨。为了给钢铁生产提供更多耐火材料，车间职工更在8月份试验成功了粘土砖不烧窑的重大技术。虽然粘土砖不烧窑在理论上没有任何根据，但是在车间党总支支持下，职工们改变了制砖的结合剂，经过十几次试验，不经过烧窑的粘土砖耐火温度达到了一千六百度以上，强度和其他质量指标都完全合格。今年1至8月份就已生产了二万三千多吨。最近他们又再次将原订今年生产六万三千吨砖的跃进计划重新修订，争取生产七万二千吨来满足生产和建设的需要。
