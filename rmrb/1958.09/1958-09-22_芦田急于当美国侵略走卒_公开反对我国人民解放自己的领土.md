Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: Former Japanese Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida openly asserted on the 18th that the Kishi Nobusuke government should base its foreign policy on supporting the U.S.'s armed aggression against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait.

Ashida is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Research Council of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. On the 18th, at the first general meeting of the "Foreign Affairs Research Association," he openly opposed the Chinese people liberating their own territory, Taiwan.

The "Foreign Affairs Research Association" was recently formed by Diet members within the Liberal Democratic Party who are colluding with the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, belonging to the factions led by former Deputy Prime Minister Mitsujiro Ishii and former Finance Minister Hayato Ikeda.

Ashida believes that if China successively liberates Jinmen and Taiwan, then the chain linking Taiwan, Japan, and the Philippines, which the United States uses for aggression in the Far East, "will have a gap opened up."

Ashida is eager to openly act as an accomplice of U.S. imperialism in its aggression against the Chinese people. He even believes that Fujiyama Aiichiro's execution of a foreign policy that submits to the U.S. and is hostile to the Chinese people is not resolute enough, expressing dissatisfaction with Fujiyama's "hesitation" in implementing this policy. Therefore, in his speech, he advocated that Japan, when considering the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait, must pay attention to the firm attitude adopted by the United States: if "Free China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang) is threatened by an attack from the (Chinese) Communists, it will not hesitate to participate in the war."

From Ashida's above remarks and Fujiyama Aiichiro's speech at the UN General Assembly on the 18th, advocating the establishment of a UN peacekeeping force to launch attacks on China and the liberation movements of all oppressed peoples, it is not difficult to see the vicious face of the Japanese reactionaries actively acting as accomplices of the U.S. in its aggression against China, clamoring to send troops abroad to prevent the Chinese people from liberating their own territory in an attempt to make a fortune by actively fueling the flames for the U.S., helping the villain to do evil, so that Japan can restore its "Jinmu Boom," and even attempting to interfere in Taiwan.

### 芦田急于当美国侵略走卒  公开反对我国人民解放自己的领土

    芦田急于当美国侵略走卒
    公开反对我国人民解放自己的领土
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本前首相芦田均18日公然主张，岸信介政府应该以支持美国在台湾海峡地区对中国人民进行武装侵略作为日本外交政策的基础。
    芦田均是执政的自由民主党的外交调查会会长。他18日在“外交问题研究会”第一次大会上公开反对中国人民解放自己的领土台湾。
    “外交问题研究会”是最近由自由民主党内与美国和蒋介石集团勾勾搭搭的属于以前副首相石井光次郎和前大藏相池田勇人为首的派系的国会议员组成的。
    芦田均认为，如果中国相继解放金门和台湾，那么联接台湾、日本和菲律宾的这条美国在远东进行侵略的锁链“就打开了一个缺口”。
    芦田均急于公开充当美帝国主义侵略中国人民的走卒，他甚至对藤山爱一郎执行屈从美国、敌视中国人民的外交政策方面还认为不够坚决，对藤山执行这项政策时“犹豫不决”表示不满。因此他在讲话中主张日本在考虑台湾海峡的紧张局势时，必须注意美国所采取的这种坚定的态度：如果“自由中国（指蒋介石匪帮）遭到（中国）共产党进攻的威胁，它将毫不犹豫地参加战争”。
    人们从芦田均的上述谈话和藤山爱一郎18日在联大会议上主张建立联合国和平部队向中国和一切被压迫民族的解放运动发动进攻的发言中，不难看出日本反动派积极充当美国侵略中国的帮凶，扬言要派兵出国阻止中国人民解放自己的领土以图在他们积极为美国推波助澜，助纣为虐中大发横财，使日本恢复“神武景气”，甚至妄图染指台湾的恶毒嘴脸。
