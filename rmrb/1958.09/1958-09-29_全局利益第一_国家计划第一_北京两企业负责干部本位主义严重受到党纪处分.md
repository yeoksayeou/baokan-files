    Overall Interests First, National Plan First
    Responsible Cadres of Two Beijing Enterprises Severely Punished by Party Discipline for Serious Departmentalism
    (Our Dispatch) The Party member responsible cadres of the Beijing Joint State-Private Owned Chaoyang Electric Motor Factory and the Northern Suburbs Livestock Farm have recently been subjected to Party disciplinary action because of their serious departmentalism and disregard for Party discipline.
    The Party member responsible cadres of the Chaoyang Electric Motor Factory arbitrarily used a large number of electric motors and generators that the factory had no right to dispose of to exchange for various raw materials and machinery and equipment from other units. From June to late August, more than 2,800 units were exchanged, including silicon steel ingots, steel plates, medium carbon steel, bearings, cutting machine tools, and so on. In the exchange activities, they also stipulated that each procurement personnel had the right to handle 3,000 kilowatts of electric motors, and could "use them flexibly, regardless of the amount, and resolutely overcome difficulties to achieve the goal." Therefore, the procurement personnel did not consider whether there was an actual need in production, and grabbed whatever goods they saw; and carried out "multilateral trade", using large electric motors to exchange for small electric motors, and then using small electric motors to exchange for other things. After the responsible comrades of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee criticized and stopped the wrong practice of "bartering goods" at two meetings, the Party member responsible cadres of this factory still exchanged 1,000 electric motors with other factories for silicon steel sheets and pig iron on August 21. Two days later, the Municipal Party Committee made a third communication and instruction on this issue, but Su Zhengwu, the deputy director of the factory's new factory construction preparation office, convened a meeting of procurement personnel on the 24th to arrange for outbound tasks: First, urge the relevant factories to fulfill the barter contract in advance; second, continue to barter, but "must be approved by the factory level", and must be "carried out as soon as possible". On the 27th, the leaders of the Municipal Industry Bureau once again instructed them not to exchange goods, but Su Zhengwu sent two people to other factories that night to urge the fulfillment of the barter contract. However, in terms of implementing the national plan, the leaders of this factory were not very active. From June to August, there were already 39 overdue contracts, which affected the production of brother factories.
    The mistake of the Party member responsible cadres of the Northern Suburbs Livestock Farm was: they did not seriously implement the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee on vacating houses for the bearing factory, and indulged the employees to create difficulties in various ways, which affected the production of bearings.
    Recently, the higher-level Party organizations of the Chaoyang Electric Motor Factory and the Northern Suburbs Livestock Farm—the Xicheng District Committee and the Changping District Committee of the Communist Party of China—in order to strictly enforce Party discipline and resolutely stop the unhealthy trend of departmentalism, so as to maintain the planning and discipline of the socialist construction cause, have decided to give Su Zhengwu, deputy director of the new factory construction preparation office of the Chaoyang Electric Motor Factory, Factory Director Dong Shengshan, Factory Party Committee Secretary Jiang Han, Zhao Huanping, secretary of the Party General Branch of the Northern Suburbs Livestock Farm, and Zhao Haiquan, director of the farm and member of the Party General Branch, Party disciplinary action.

### 全局利益第一  国家计划第一  北京两企业负责干部本位主义严重受到党纪处分

    全局利益第一  国家计划第一
    北京两企业负责干部本位主义严重受到党纪处分
    本报讯  北京市公私合营朝阳电机厂和北郊畜牧场的党员负责干部，由于本位主义严重和无视党的纪律，最近分别受到党的纪律处分。
    朝阳电机厂的党员负责干部擅自把本厂无权处理的大批电动机、发电机，拿来向其他单位换取各种原材料和机器设备。从6月到8月下旬，共换出二千八百多台，换进的有矽钢锭、钢板、中炭钢、轴承、切削机床等等。在换货活动中，他们还规定每一个采购人员有权处理电动机三千瓩，并可“多少不拘，灵活运用，坚决克服困难，以达到目的为止”。因此，采购人员不考虑是否生产上实际需要，见货就抓；并且进行“多边贸易”，拿大电动机换小电动机，再拿小电动机去换别的东西。中共北京市委负责同志在两次会议上提出批评，制止“以货易货”的错误作法以后，这个厂的党员负责干部仍在8月21日以一千台电动机同外厂交换矽钢片和生铁。两天以后，市委对这个问题又作了第三次的传达和指示，但这个厂的新厂筹建处副主任苏正悟却在24日召集采购人员会议，布置外出任务：一、催有关厂提前履行换货合同；二、继续换货，只是“必须经厂级批准”，并且要“抓紧进行，越快越好”。27日，市工业局的领导人再次指示他们不能换货，苏正悟却在当晚又派出两人去外厂催促履行换货合同。可是，在执行国家计划方面，这个厂的领导人员却很不积极。从6月到8月，误期的合同已经有三十九份，影响了兄弟工厂的生产。
    北郊畜牧场党员负责干部的错误是：不认真执行市委关于腾房给轴承厂的指示，并且放纵职工多方刁难，以致影响了轴承的生产。
    最近，朝阳电机厂和北郊畜牧场的上级党组织——中共西城区委和昌平区委为了严肃党纪，坚决制止本位主义的歪风，以维护社会主义建设事业的计划性和纪律性，已经决定分别给朝阳电机厂新厂筹建处副主任苏正悟、厂长董省三、厂党委书记江汉，北郊畜牧场党总支书记赵焕平、场长兼党总支委员赵海泉五人以党纪处分。
