Everyone praises the people's commune,
The youth say it's absolutely wonderful,
Life and study are collectivized,
Labor and production are even more energetic.

Everyone praises the people's commune,
Women say it's like a flower,
No need to cook or take care of children,
Labor and production are carefree.

Everyone praises the people's commune,
Children are always smiling,
Hugging "dolls" in the nursery,
Babbling all day long.

Everyone praises the people's commune,
The elderly say it's paradise,
Life in old age is sweeter than sugar,
Happiness never forgetting the Communist Party.

    人人夸公社
    人民公社人人夸，青年说它顶呱呱，生活学习集体化，劳动生产劲更大。人民公社人人夸，妇女说它像朵花，不用烧饭不带娃，劳动生产无牵挂。人民公社人人夸，儿童老是笑哈哈，托儿所里抱“娃娃”，一天到晚咿呀呀。人民公社人人夸，老人说它是天堂，晚年生活赛砂糖，幸福不忘共产党。
