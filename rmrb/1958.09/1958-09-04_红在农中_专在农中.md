　　Red in Agricultural Middle School, Specialized in Agricultural Middle School
　　Teacher of Lizhuang Agricultural Middle School, Liuji Township, Tongshan County, Ye Guoying
　　On May 19th of this year, I was assigned to Lizhuang Agricultural Middle School in Liuji Township, Tongshan County, Jiangsu. People from the township came to pick me up, and the commune specially sent a flatbed cart to carry me. I thought to myself, "The Party takes such good care of someone who has just taken up a job and hasn't made any achievements yet." A struggle unfolded in my mind: "How can I do my job well? Who will help me when I get here!" I couldn't help but feel scared, and then I thought of my mother, and then I recalled the happy scenes at school, and I couldn't help but cry. The Party Branch Secretary of the commune saw that my eyes were red from crying, so he comforted me and took care of me in my life, having his daughter stay with me, finding a small room, specially building a small door, and setting up the bedding. It was truly meticulous. The commune members also warmly surrounded me and chatted about everyday life.

　　The next day, the Party Branch Secretary of the commune saw that my eyes were still red and asked with a questioning tone, "Are all the people who came this time girls?" After introducing the school's situation, he said, "This school of ours is not easy to run." When I arrived at the school and looked around, the classrooms were three dilapidated cowsheds, with two wooden boards placed crookedly inside as desks, and a tiny blackboard. When I saw it, I thought to myself, "Since I'm here, I must do a good job." I had also written a letter of determination and made a guarantee: "I will never disgrace Nanjing." Thinking of this, I was full of energy, and my courage increased, and the difficulties in front of me seemed small, even completely disappeared. I also thought of a solution: "Only by closely relying on the Party and relying on the masses." My action slogan was: "Three Diligences and One Leading!" The three diligences are: diligent legs, diligent mouth, and diligent work. One leading is to take the lead in enduring hardship. To encourage myself, I also wrote four slogans and hung them in my residence as my motto, namely: "Red and Specialized, Make a Leaping and Permanent Rural Female Teacher!" "Drill in for a few months, a year, two years, three years, five years, and you can always learn it."

　　After arriving at the school, I first organized the school environment and quickly started classes. I ran through the communes, teams, and student families where the students lived, and as a result, only eight students came from the first team of Lizhuang Village. Some production team leaders said to the students, "If you want to go to school, ask your teacher if you will have food to eat." The students also said, "Is this like a school? It collapses and then starts again. A girl comes from the city, speaking strange words, who can understand? The school will collapse sooner or later!" I was not discouraged by these reactions, but instead turned them into strength. I led the eight students to start organizing the environment, picking up a broom to sweep, and carrying buckets of water to wash the desks and benches. The students watched around, wanting to see if I could do it or not. They saw that I was sweating profusely and were finally moved and started working with me, sweeping and wiping, and in just half a day, the classroom was cleaned up very well. The students also moved in desks and benches. The first class began, and the students were a little noisy. I said in a kind but serious tone, "We should maintain silence in class, listen to the teacher, and after class, we are like brothers and sisters. If you have any opinions, you can raise them, and I guarantee to improve." The students felt that my class was satisfactory. After school, they spread the word: "The teacher is capable and teaches well." The team did not keep students from working due to busy production, but instead mobilized students to come to school to study. The next day of class, the number of students increased to twenty, and now there are fifty students.

　　I took the initiative to do whatever work was assigned by the higher authorities or the commune. People said, "Once upon a time, there was Mu Guiying, and now we have Ye Guoying in our commune." I not only ran ahead to work in the three major movements, waterlogging drainage, drought resistance, rushing to plant, eliminating weeds, and well digging, but also mobilized commune members and students to do it together. Even if my hands were broken, I still kept working. The branch secretary asked me, "How is it?" I said, "It doesn't matter, people do the work, and I must learn it." Once, I came back very late from a literacy meeting in Banlou Village. I didn't rest, but found a few students to work on "Ten Thousand Things Literacy", putting up posters and creating wall newspapers. Suddenly someone asked, "What are you doing!" It turned out to be the branch secretary. He said to me, "It's already past three o'clock, why aren't you going to sleep? The rooster will crow soon."

　　I once said, "Red in the countryside, specialized in agricultural middle school, grow up in Tongshan, and take root in Tongshan." Wherever I go, there is the sound of calling Teacher Ye. Cadres, commune members, men, women, old and young, treat me as warmly as their own family. As soon as some fresh things are ripe locally, they are sent to me to eat, such as porridge made from new wheat, corn, and fresh peaches. Sometimes I politely refuse to eat, and the commune members say, "If you don't eat it, you dislike it." Aunt Wang, the landlord, had chest pain. I sent a package of Rendan and fried salt to warm her abdomen. She said excitedly, "You care more about me than my own daughter." In addition, I also prepared gentian violet, red mercury, penicillin, Xiaozhilong ointment, eye drops, etc., for emergency use by commune members. Therefore, the commune members gave me a nickname: "Everything is complete". Some time ago, I assisted the county education bureau in going to Nanjing to visit the families of agricultural middle school teachers who came to support the local area. When I returned to school, as soon as I entered the village, everyone surrounded me, and you said one thing, and he said another: "Teacher Ye, you are back, it seems like months have passed since you left." Once, I was sick, and Aunt Wang specially made a bowl of "Hema" eggs and brought them to me to eat. I was so moved that I cried. Commune members and cadres mistakenly thought I was homesick and came to comfort me. They asked me when I was going back to Nanjing. I said, "I'll go home when I grow a beard!" Making everyone laugh.

　　"If you don't know how to do it, learn it. Sooner or later you will learn it thoroughly." This is my labor compass. I help with whatever work others do, and I want to ask about everything when I do it. In more than two months, I have worshiped many masters and learned a lot of production techniques, such as cutting wheat, tying rope knots, weaving straw hat braids, pulling bellows, winding windlasses, winnowing, grinding, and digging wells.

　　"I have no experience in teaching, so I work hard to prepare. Often I am still preparing lessons or grading homework at twelve o'clock in the evening." Before explaining the main root and fibrous root of plants in agricultural class, I pulled a soybean from the field and let the students observe it. The students said, "It's easier to understand when taught like this."

　　Agricultural middle school is a new undertaking. There are bound to be some difficulties in the work, but with the correct leadership of the Party and the support of the broad masses, I have unlimited strength in my work. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, I am determined to overcome all difficulties. In the future, I will improve myself in all aspects, share weal and woe with the masses, love students, and teach diligently, and cultivate students into "four highs" students with high political level, high academic performance, high labor efficiency, and high production technology. I am determined to run agricultural middle schools well.

　　红在农中　专在农中
　　铜山县刘集乡李庄农业中学教师　叶国英
    今年5月19日，我被分配到江苏铜山县刘集乡李庄农业中学。乡里来人接我，社里特地派来一辆平车拖我。我想对一个刚走上工作岗位而没有做出丝毫成绩的人，党就照顾得这样周到，思想上不由得展开了斗争：“怎样做好工作呢？一个人到这里谁来帮助哪！”不免害怕起来，忽而又联想到妈妈，忽而又回忆在校内欢乐的情景，不禁哭了起来。社的党支部书记见我眼睛都哭红了，就一面劝慰我，一面在生活上照顾我，让他女儿陪伴我住宿，找了一间小房子，专打了一扇小门，弄好铺头，真是无微不至。社员也都亲热地围着我谈家常。
    第二天社的党支部书记见到我的眼睛还是红红的，就以怀疑的口吻问：“你们这次来的都是女的吗？”在介绍学校情况后说：“咱们这个学校不大好搞。”到了学校一望，教室是三间破牛屋，屋内两块木板歪歪斜斜地放着，当作课桌，还有一块顶小的黑板。我看了，心里想：“既然来就要搞好工作。”当初也曾写过决心书下过保证：“决不给南京丢脸。”想到这里全身是劲，勇气倍增，眼前的困难就显得渺小了，甚至完全消失。办法也想到了：“只有紧密地依靠党，依靠群众。”我的行动口号是：“三勤一带头！”三勤是：腿勤、嘴勤、活儿干得勤。一带头，是吃苦带头。为了鞭策自己，我又写四幅标语挂在住室内作为座右铭，即：“红透专深，做一个跃进牌的永久牌的乡村女教师！”“钻进去几个月、一年、二年、三年、五年，总可以学会的”。
    到校后，我首先整理学校环境，迅速开起学来。我跑遍了学生所在的社、队和学生家庭，结果只有李庄村第一队来了八位同学，有的生产队长对学生说：“你们要上学，你们吃不吃饭，去问问你们的老师。”学生也说：“像个学校吗？垮了又叫上，从城里来一个女丫头，说的蛮话，谁听得懂？学校早晚是垮！”我听了这些反应并不灰心，反而化为力量。我领着八位同学开始整理环境，摸把扫帚就扫，挑起水桶搞了一担水洗刷桌凳。同学却在周围观望，想看我到底行是不行？他们看我累得满头是汗，终于受了感动和我一起劳动起来，扫的扫，抹的抹，只半天功夫就把教室整理得很清洁。同学们也搬来了桌凳。第一堂课开始了，同学们有点乱，我以亲切而严肃的口吻说：“咱们上课应当保持肃静，做到听老师的话，下了课咱们是亲弟妹，有什么意见你们提上来，我保证改进。”学生感到我的课还满意。放学后他们传开了：“老师能干，教的还可以。”队里也不因生产忙留学生干活，反而动员同学来校学习。上课的第二天学生就增到二十人，现在学生已达五十人。
    凡是上级布置的工作或社里的工作，我都主动干。人家都说：“从前有个穆桂英，现在我们社里有个叶国英。”三大运动、排涝、抗旱、抢种、消灭草荒、打井等，不但自己跑在前头干，还动员社员、学生都来干。手磨破了还是干，支部书记问我：“怎样？”我说：“不要紧，活都是人干的，我非学会不行。”有一次，在半楼村开扫盲会回来很晚，我不休息，找了几位同学一起搞“万物识字”，去贴标语、搞墙字，忽然有人问了一声：“干啥！”原来是支部书记，他对我说：“已经三点多了，还不去睡觉，马上鸡叫了。”
    我曾说过：“红在农村，专在农中，成长在铜山，根扎在铜山。”我到哪里，哪里就发出叶老师的喊叫声。机关干部、社员，男女老少对我热呼地像亲人一样。当地一些新鲜东西一成熟都送给我吃，如新麦磨的粥、玉米、鲜桃等，有时我婉言拒绝不吃，社员们就说：“你要不吃就是嫌孬。”房主王大娘心口疼，我送了一包仁丹又炒了食盐温腹，她激动地说：“你比我亲生的女儿还疼我。”另外我还准备了龙胆紫、红汞药水、青霉素、消治龙药膏、眼药等，供社员急救之用。因而社员给我起个绰号叫：“样样全”。前些时我协助县教育局去南京慰问前来支援本地的农业中学教师的家庭，回校时，一进庄大家就都围着我，你一言，他一语：“叶老师你可回来了，你走了这几天好像几个月似的。”有一次，我生病了，王大娘特地做了一碗“合马”鸡蛋送来给我吃，我感动得哭了。社员、干部误认为我想家都来安慰我。问我什么时候回南京，我说：“等长了胡须才回家哪！”弄得大家都笑起来。
    “不会就学，迟早总会学通”。这是我的劳动指南针，别人干啥活我都帮着干，干时啥都想问。两个多月中，我拜了不少的师傅，学会了很多生产技术，如割麦、打绳扣、编织草帽辫、拉风箱、绞辘辘、扬场、推磨、打井等。
      “在教学上我没有经验，就努力作好准备工作。往往晚上十二点还在备课或批改作业。在教农业课讲解植物主根和须根前，我从田里拔来一颗大豆，让同学们观察，同学们都说：“这样教起来容易懂”。
    农业中学是一项新的工作，在工作中不免有一些困难，但有党的正确领导，又有广大群众的支持，就使我在工作中有无限力量。在党的培养和教育下，我决心克服一切困难，今后我要从各方面提高自己，与群众同甘共苦，热爱学生，认真教课，把学生培养成为政治水平高，学习成绩高，劳动效率高，生产技术高的“四高”学生，决心把农业中学办好。
