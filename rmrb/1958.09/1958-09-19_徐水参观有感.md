Impressions of a Visit to Xushui
　　Shen Junru, Chen Shutong

　　Everyone competes to say how good the People's Commune is,
　　I heard that Xushui has already begun;
　　This trip is to see with my own eyes,
　　The leaping mood surpasses the turbulent rapids.

　　Ideals can all become reality,
　　Not only great harvests year after year.
　　Industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military are one,
　　In this way, we can truly become prosperous and strong.

　　Ideological liberation is the vanguard,
　　Enthusiasm can only surge upwards;
　　Only the Party leads first,
　　From now on, the people have strong confidence.

　　Murals and poems are all moving,
　　What is most valuable is the sincerity of feeling.
　　Vigorous and full of vitality,
　　Loving the commune as one's home has its own reasons.

    徐水参观有感
    沈钧儒　陈叔通
  争说人民公社好，
  我闻徐水已开端；
  此行亲眼来观看，
  飞跃心情胜激湍。
  理想都能成现实，
  岂惟岁岁大丰穰。
  工农商学兵一体，
  如此真能到富强。
  思想解放是先锋，
  干劲才能向上冲；
  只有党先来领导，
  人民从此信心浓。
  壁画诗歌尽动人，
  最为难得感情真。
  蓬蓬勃勃皆生气，
  爱社如家自有因。
