    After Communalization of Dining Halls
  　Ye Qianyu, Poem and Painting
　　With the establishment of communal dining halls, the stoves are liberated; large stoves are built, and small stoves are idle; to support the industrialization of the commune, discarded pots are moved to plant fields of steel and iron.

    食堂化以后
  　叶浅予　诗并画锅台解放食堂开，大灶建立小灶闲；支援公社工业化，废锅移种钢铁田。
