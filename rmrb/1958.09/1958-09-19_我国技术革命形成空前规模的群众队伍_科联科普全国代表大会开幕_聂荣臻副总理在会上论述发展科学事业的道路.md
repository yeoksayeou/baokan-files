Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The National Congress of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization opened in Beijing today. More than a thousand technical innovation experts and organizational work cadres and leaders of the technical revolution who emerged from factories, rural areas, research institutions, schools, and scientific organizations in twenty-eight provinces, cities, and autonomous regions gathered in the capital today, demonstrating that a mass force of the technical revolution has been formed, and displaying the magnificent spirit of the Chinese scientific and technological community united as never before and determined to conquer all scientific fortresses.

Li Siguang, Chairman of the National Science Association, delivered the opening speech at the meeting. He said that the two organizations, the Science Association and the Popular Science Association, have played their due organizational role in mobilizing and organizing national science and technology workers to actively participate in various social, political, and academic activities since their establishment in 1950. Li Siguang also encouraged scientific workers not to be satisfied with this achieved success, but to continue to adhere to a longer-term and arduous ideological self-reform; they must put politics in command, resolutely pull out the white flag of bourgeois individualism in ideology, learning, and various tasks such as production, teaching, and scientific research, hold high the red flag, and stride forward in the direction of "diligent study, hard practice, being red and expert"; under the illumination of the Party's socialist general line, further exert their energy, and bravely plunge into the glorious battle of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution. Li Siguang finally emphasized that the current new situation of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution requires a faster development of science and technology; requires that the popularization and improvement of science and technology should be more closely integrated. In order to adapt to this new requirement, in this conference, we must also focus on discussing further adjusting our organization and determining our new work guidelines and tasks, so as to better realize the policy of combining science and technology with production, combining intellectuals with workers and peasants, better play the role of mass scientific and technological organizations, and carry out the mass movement of the technical revolution.

Nie Rongzhen, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Vice Premier of the State Council, and Director of the Science Planning Commission, congratulated the conference on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and made a report of more than two hours at the meeting (detailed summary on the second page). He gave a detailed and brilliant exposition on the path and policy of developing scientific undertakings and carrying out technical revolution in our country.

Subsequently, the conference heard a report on the work of the Science Association by Hou Debang, Vice Chairman of the National Science Association, and a report on the work of the Popular Science Association by Ding Xilin, Vice Chairman of the National Popular Science Association.

After the morning session, Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen met with some of the "native" experts attending the conference. Wu Yuzhang, President of Renmin University of China, Fan Changjiang, Secretary-General of the Science Planning Commission of the State Council, and Qian Sanqiang, Director of the Institute of Atomic Energy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, were present at the meeting. Among the "native" experts who were received were: Jin Shan (Mongolian), a fitter from the Automobile Repair Factory of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, who successfully manufactured the "silicon steel sheet intermediate die," which can increase work efficiency by 959 times; Long Wenzhong, a technician from the Wuhan Fourth Construction Engineering Company, who created forty-three kinds of construction machinery such as electric grout extrusion walling machines and electric mortar mixers; Cao Yixiu (Dai nationality), an old woman in her sixties, who mastered the living habits of mice and caught more than 10,000 mice; Ning Huatang, a famous old sheep worker, who has now been hired as a professor at Shanxi Agricultural College; Ma Tongyi, a farmer and the originator of deep plowing, and Hou Wanxiang, a Young Pioneer, and many others. Hou Wanxiang is a primary school student from Linxia City, Gansu Province, and is only thirteen years old. His contribution to the technical innovation movement was designing and building a "Red Scarf" hydroelectric power station. Vice Premier Nie bent down and said kindly to Hou Wanxiang: You are a small expert now, and you will become a big expert when you grow up! Saying you are a small expert means you are young, not that we do not value your achievements. Qian Sanqiang encouraged Hou Wanxiang and said: I hope you will build an atomic energy power station in the future!

This afternoon, the representatives attending the conference discussed Vice Premier Nie's report in groups. The conference is scheduled to last eight days.

    我国技术革命形成空前规模的群众队伍
    科联科普全国代表大会开幕
    聂荣臻副总理在会上论述发展科学事业的道路
    据新华社18日讯　中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会、中华全国科学技术普及协会全国代表大会今天在北京开幕。从二十八个省、市、自治区的工厂、农村、研究机关、学校和科学团体中涌现出来的一千多个技术革新能手和技术革命的组织工作干部以及领导人员，今日在首都会师一堂，显示出技术革命的群众队伍已经形成；显示了我国科学技术界空前团结一致、决心攻克所有科学堡垒的雄壮气概。
    全国科联主席李四光在会上致开幕词，他说，科联、科普两个团体自从1950年成立以来的八年中，在动员和组织全国科学技术工作者积极参加各项社会、政治、学术活动等等方面，都发挥了它们应有的组织作用。李四光还勉励科学工作者们，不要满足于这个既得的成就，必须继续坚持较长期、艰巨的自我思想改造；必须政治挂帅，坚决地在思想上、学习上以及生产、教学、科学研究等各项工作中拔掉资产阶级个人主义的白旗，高举红旗，向“勤学苦练、红透专深”的方向大步迈进；在党的社会主义总路线的照耀下，更加鼓足干劲，奋勇投入技术革命、文化革命的光荣战斗行列。李四光最后强调说，当前技术革命、文化革命的新形势，要求科学技术有更高速度的发展；要求科学技术的普及与提高应该更加紧密地结合起来，为了适应这种新的要求，在这次大会中，我们还要着重商讨进一步调整我们的组织，决定我们新的工作方针任务，以便更好地实现科学技术与生产相结合、知识分子与工农劳动群众相结合的方针，更好地发挥科学技术群众团体的作用，开展技术革命的群众运动。
    中共中央委员、国务院副总理兼科学规划委员会主任聂荣臻代表党中央和国务院向大会祝贺，并在会上作了两个多小时的报告（详细摘要见第二版），他对我国发展科学事业进行技术革命的道路和方针作了详细的精湛的论述。
    接着，大会听取了全国科联副主席侯德榜关于科联会务工作的报告以及全国科普协会副主席丁西林关于科普协会的会务工作报告。
    上午的大会结束后，聂荣臻副总理接见了出席大会的一部分“土”专家。接见时在座的有中国人民大学校长吴玉章、国务院科学规划委员会秘书长范长江、中国科学院原子能研究所所长钱三强。被接见的“土”专家中有：内蒙古自治区汽车修配厂钳工金山（蒙族），他制造成功了“矽钢片中模”，可提高工作效率九百五十九倍；武汉第四建筑工程公司技师龙文忠，他创造了电动挤浆砌墙机、电动合灰机等四十三种建筑机械；六十多岁的老大娘曹依秀（傣族），她掌握了老鼠的生活习性，捕捉了一万多只老鼠；宁华堂，著名的老羊工，现已应聘为山西农学院教授；农民马同义，深翻土地的首创者，以及少先队员侯万祥等多人。侯万祥是甘肃临夏市的小学生，还只有十三岁，他在技术革新运动中的功迹是设计建造了一座“红领巾”水电站。聂副总理俯下身子亲切地对侯万祥说：你现在是小专家，将来长大了要成为大专家！说你小专家是指你年纪小，并不是不重视你的成绩。钱三强勉励侯万祥说：希望你将来建造一个原子能发电站！
