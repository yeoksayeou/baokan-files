Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 22nd. The Third Congress of the National Front of Democratic Germany passed a resolution on the Far East situation. The resolution emphasizes that all of China, including all its islands, belongs to the Chinese people! The Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan is also a struggle to defend world peace! We wholeheartedly support the just cause of the Chinese people. We give fraternal support to the Chinese people who are peacefully building their country and advancing towards prosperity, happiness and socialism through peaceful means. Down with the war instigators of Washington and Bonn!
 The resolution said that world peace is in danger! The United States is provoking the great Chinese people in the Far East, in the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese people's liberation of the islands forcibly occupied by US imperialism is the most just cause in the world. Every peace-loving German declares at this moment that they fully support the just struggle of the Chinese people.
