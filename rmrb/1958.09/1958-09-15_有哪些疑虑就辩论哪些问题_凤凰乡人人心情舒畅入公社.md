    Debate Whatever Concerns Exist
    Phoenix Township Residents Join the Commune with Joy
    (Reported by this newspaper) In Phoenix Township, Laibin County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, during the movement to establish people's communes, a large-scale debate was launched, and in-depth ideological mobilization was carried out. More than five thousand six hundred people in the township joined the people's commune with joy.
    Phoenix Township originally had ten agricultural producers' cooperatives. After the rural rectification and the great leap in production, the political consciousness of the members greatly increased, and they asked to establish people's communes. However, in the process of establishing the commune, some cadres and members, due to a lack of understanding of the nature and system of the commune, still had some concerns. For example, societies with better natural conditions were afraid of suffering losses, and some wealthy peasants were afraid that their houses would be collectivized. In response to these ideological concerns, under the organization and leadership of the township Party committee, all societies launched a great airing of views and a large-scale debate.
    Before the debate, combined with the actual situation of the township and the community, accounting and comparison were carried out to promote the ten advantages of the people's commune. Members of Xinglong and Zhoucun societies calculated the cost of grass cutting: In the past, they often went to the mountainous areas of Sanling and Niujiao societies to cut grass. One person could cut two bundles a day, using about 86,400 bundles of grass throughout the year, requiring 43,200 workdays. After the establishment of the commune, everyone cooperated, and Sanling and Niujiao cut grass nearby. Only 6,000 workdays are needed throughout the year. Xinglong and Zhoucun only need to drive cattle carts to transport it, saving 24,000 workdays throughout the year; using these workdays to mine iron ore, more than 9,000 tons of ore can be produced in a year. Many members also compared and explained the benefits of establishing a commune from the perspective of national unity and development of production. This township has 60% Zhuang people and 40% Han people. Originally, there were interspersed fields between villages and societies, totaling more than 5,000 mu in the township. After the establishment of the commune, the land in the township was unified and adjusted, which can save 70,000 workdays each year and further promote national unity. Through the debate, everyone further realized the benefits of establishing a commune.
    These two societies also focused on debating whether societies with good conditions for establishing a commune would "suffer losses." Some people proposed: Xinglong and Zhoucun are two large societies, but after jointly building a hydropower station, due to insufficient funds, the more than 10,000 yuan needed for light bulbs and wires could not be resolved for a long time. After becoming a people's commune, this fund was immediately resolved. Is this "fat meat" being divided by others, or is everyone getting "fat meat"? Old member Li He said happily: "People who are afraid of suffering losses are too short-sighted. I think the establishment of the commune is much stronger than now. The lights are on, and the grain is abundant. What's wrong with that?" Specific discussions and explanations were made on the handling principles of production materials and living materials, and everyone was happy and everyone asked to join the commune.
    After the Phoenix People's Commune was officially established on August 22, a larger-scale upsurge in industrial and agricultural production was quickly set off throughout the commune.

    有哪些疑虑就辩论哪些问题
    凤凰乡人人心情舒畅入公社
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区来宾县凤凰乡，在建立人民公社运动中，开展大辩论，进行了深入的思想发动工作，全乡五千六百多人，心情舒畅地加入了人民公社。
    凤凰乡原有十个农业生产合作社。经过农村整风和生产大跃进，社员的政治觉悟大为提高，纷纷要求建立人民公社。但是，在建社过程中，个别干部和社员由于对公社的性质、制度缺乏认识，还存在着一些疑虑。如：自然条件较好的社怕吃亏，有的富裕农民怕房屋归公。针对这些思想疑虑，在乡党委的组织领导下，各个社开展了大鸣大放大辩论。
    在辩论前，结合本乡本社的实际情况，进行了算账对比，宣传人民公社的十大优越性。兴隆、周村两社的社员算了一笔割草的账：过去他们常年到山区的三陵、牛角等社去割草，一天一人割得两担，全年约用草八万六千四百担，需工四万三千二百个。建立公社后，大家协作，由三陵、牛角就近割草，全年只需六千工，兴隆、周村只要赶牛车去运，全年可省工二万四千个；用这些工来挖铁矿，一年可出矿石九千多吨。许多社员还从民族团结发展生产方面对比说明成立公社的好处。这个乡有60％的僮族，40％的汉族。原来各村、社之间都有插花地，全乡共计五千多亩。成立公社后，全乡土地统一调整，每年可省工七万个，而且进一步促进了民族团结。通过辩论，使大家进一步认识到建立公社的好处。
    这两个社还着重辩论了建立公社条件好的社是否“吃亏”的问题。有些人提出：兴隆、周村是两个大社，可是合建水电站后，由于资金不足，电球电线所需的一万多元很久无法解决，并成人民公社后，这笔资金马上就解决了。这是“肥肉”挨别人分了，还是大家都得到了“肥肉”呢？老社员李和标高兴地说：“怕吃亏的人眼光太短了，我看成立公社要比现在强得多，电灯点上了，粮食丰收了，还有什么不好呢？”关于生产资料和生活资料的处理原则，都进行了具体的讨论和说明，人人心情愉快，个个要求加入公社。
    凤凰人民公社于8月22日正式成立后，全公社迅速掀起了更大规模的工农业生产高潮。
