On the morning of September 6, Chen Huixiang, a member of the Puyuan Village Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangtou Township, Xiamen City, began a day of peaceful labor with his family. The children's mother went to the village canteen early in the morning to cook. Chen Huixiang cooked pig feed and was responsible for feeding more than 30 fat pigs in the cooperative. The two children, Axing and Jiazhi, carried a bucket of pig feed to feed the 50 piglets in the cooperative.

It was just after ten o'clock in the morning. Axing and Jiazhi had just poured the pig feed into the feeding trough when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's killing shells suddenly exploded in the village. Chen Huixiang's house was hit by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's shells both in front and behind, as well as inside the house. When Chen Huixiang rushed back from where he was feeding the pigs, Jiazhi had already been crushed to death under the collapsed wall, and Axing was also injured in the head and right foot and fell to the ground. A family that had been happy just minutes before was destroyed and bereaved of their daughter, and their son was injured, all due to the vicious bombardment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army.

At noon on September 7, Chen Huixiang, filled with a blood feud against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, came to the position of the Second Company of a certain artillery unit on the front line to denounce the heinous crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army to the artillery soldiers. With tears in his eyes, he recounted to the soldiers the ordeal his family had suffered. He said that before liberation, he was forced by landlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries to leave his hometown and abandon his wife and children to work in Southeast Asia. After liberation, he was allocated land, and his life became stable. After collectivization, his life became better day by day. Now, just as people's communes were about to be established for an even happier life, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, who are cruel to the people, destroyed his home, took his daughter's life, and injured his son. He said passionately, "Comrades! I ask you to avenge me, to severely punish Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor who harms the country and the people. I will definitely actively produce in the rear to support you!"

The soldiers listened to Chen Huixiang's accusations. The fire of hatred burned in the soldiers' hearts. Many soldiers had tears in their eyes.

At this time, Instructor Xiao Enming suggested that all soldiers stand in silence to mourn the dead compatriots. All the soldiers stood at attention, and the muzzles of the cannons, which had been proudly pointing to the sky, were also lowered.

The soldiers were extremely angry. They wrote one determination letter after another. On the position, people were nervously wiping the cannons and carrying shells, waiting for a solemn moment: to avenge the dead compatriots, open fire on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army!

At noon on the 8th, the order to carry out punitive strikes against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army arrived at this company. The raised muzzles quickly aimed at the enemy, and deafening volleys of artillery fire roared violently. On the position, slogans of "Avenge the dead compatriots, open fire!" and "Aim at the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army that harms the country and the people, open fire!" resounded. Gunner Lü Gongju loaded and fired more than sixty shells into the enemy's position by himself. Gunner Zhang Aisheng took out his own shirt to wipe the shells. People forgot themselves in the battle, all for the sake of punishing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army.

In a series of rapid-fire shots, the heroic gunners silenced the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's artillery positions that frequently shelled our coastal compatriots, and buried the murderers in thick smoke and flames.

"Well done, that's really satisfying, this will send the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to heaven!" "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" The cheers of victory immediately erupted in the coastal towns and forward positions.

### 为死难同胞复仇，开炮！

    为死难同胞复仇，开炮！
    新华社记者　陈希明
    9月6日早晨，厦门市江头乡浦圆村农业社社员陈辉祥一家开始了一天的和平劳动。孩子的妈妈一早就到村里的食堂去烧饭了，陈辉祥烧好猪食，负责喂社里的三十多头大肥猪，阿兴和佳治两个孩子抬着一桶猪食，去喂社里的五十头小猪。
    这时正是上午十点多钟。阿兴和佳治刚刚把猪食倒进食槽，蒋贼军的杀伤炮弹突然在村子里爆炸起来。陈辉祥的屋子前后和屋子里都被蒋贼军的炮弹击中。当陈辉祥急忙从喂猪的地方赶来的时候，佳治已经被压在倒塌的墙下死了，阿兴的头部和右脚也被炸伤倒在地下。几分钟前还是欢欢喜喜的一家人，一转眼就在蒋贼军的恶毒轰击下家破人亡。
    9月7日中午，陈辉祥带着对蒋贼军的血海深仇来到前线炮兵某部二连的阵地上，向炮兵战士们控诉蒋贼军的滔天罪行。他热泪滚滚地向战士们哭诉他一家受害的经过。他说，解放前他被地主和国民党反动派逼得无路可走，不得不离开家乡，抛下妻子儿女到南洋去做工。解放后他分到了土地，生活才安定下来，合作化后生活更加一天比一天好。现在眼看要成立人民公社过更加幸福的生活了，残民成性的蒋贼军却又毁灭了他的家，夺去了他的女儿，炸伤了他的儿子。他激昂地说：“同志们！我要求你们为我报仇，狠狠地揍蒋介石这个祸国殃民的卖国贼，我一定在后方积极生产支援你们！”
    战士们倾听着陈辉祥的控诉。仇恨的火在战士们的心里燃烧。许多战士的眼眶里含着眼泪。
    这时，指导员萧恩明建议全体战士为死难的同胞致哀。战士们全体肃立，原来昂然指向天空的大炮炮口也低垂下来。
    战士们愤怒极了。他们写了一张又一张的决心书。阵地上，人们紧张地擦拭着大炮，搬运着炮弹，在等待着一个庄严的时刻：为了给死难同胞复仇，向蒋贼军开炮！
    8日中午，向蒋贼军进行惩罚性打击的命令到了这个连队，昂起的炮口迅速地对准了敌人，震耳欲聋的排炮猛烈地轰响起来。阵地上响起了一片“为死难同胞复仇，开炮！”“对准祸国殃民的蒋贼军，开炮！”的口号声。炮手吕宫聚一个人连续把六十多发炮弹装填到炮膛里发射到敌人的阵地上。炮手张爱生拿出自己的衬衣来擦炮弹。人们在战斗中忘掉了自己，一切为了惩罚蒋贼军。
    一连几个急速射击，英雄的炮手们把经常炮击我沿海同胞的蒋贼军炮兵阵地打哑了，把杀人犯们埋葬在浓烟烈火中。
    “打得好，真解恨，这下叫蒋贼军升天了！”“人民解放军万岁！”胜利的欢呼声立时在沿海的村镇和前哨阵地上沸腾起来。
