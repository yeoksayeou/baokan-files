Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: Washington News: The U.S. government openly stated that it does not recognize the People's Republic of China's government's decision regarding its own territorial waters.

The U.S. State Department spokesperson issued a statement on the 4th regarding the Chinese government's statement on territorial waters, saying, "The United States has never recognized any claim to a twelve-nautical-mile territorial sea, and our consistent attitude towards territorial seas has always been a range of three nautical miles." This spokesperson also turned around and slandered the Chinese government, calling the Chinese government's decision to exercise its own sovereignty an "obvious attempt to cover up their aggressive purposes." On the same evening, the U.S. Department of Defense also barbarously announced that the U.S. Seventh Fleet, which is currently occupying Taiwan, does not recognize China's decision regarding the breadth of its territorial waters.

    怀抱侵略目的　无视我国主权
　　美国竟不承认我国关于领海的决定
    据新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国官方公然表示不承认中华人民共和国政府关于自己的领海宽度的决定。
    美国国务院发言人4日对中国政府关于领海的声明发表声明说，“美国从来不承认关于十二浬领海的任何要求，我们历来对领海的态度一直是三浬的范围”。这个发言人还反过来诬蔑中国政府，把中国政府行使自己主权的决定说成是“显然是企图掩盖它们的侵略目的”。同一天晚上，美国国防部也蛮横地宣布，正侵占着台湾的美国第七舰队不承认中国关于领海宽度的决定。
