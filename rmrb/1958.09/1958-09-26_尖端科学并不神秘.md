Cutting-Edge Science is Not Mysterious

The teachers and some students of the Electrical Engineering Teaching and Research Group of Wuhan Institute of Water Transportation Engineering, after five days and nights of hard work, successfully made a simulated electronic computer on September 11.

A simulated electronic computer is a complex electronic device composed of electron tubes and many components. It has a wide range of uses, and can solve complex differential equations and automatic adjustment systems, as well as complex engineering designs such as boilers, steam turbines, airplanes, rockets, and atomic reactors. It can not only save mental workers a lot of calculation effort and time, but also control the center like a nerve hub, and has a great effect on the comprehensive automation of production processes and industrial construction.

During the trial production, although the teachers and students were very enthusiastic, their confidence in engaging in cutting-edge science was still insufficient. The Party committee provided support and encouragement in many ways. For example, the Party Committee Secretary Li Qing personally went to the Electrical Engineering Teaching and Research Group and stayed up all night with the teachers. Party Committee Standing Committee members Zhou Bin and Cheng Yun helped them come up with ideas and solutions. In this way, with the support of the Party, the electronic computer was finally successfully trial-produced. (Yuan Kan)

    尖端科学并不神秘
    武汉水运工程学院电工教研组的教师和部分同学，经过五昼夜苦钻苦干，在9月11日制成模拟电子计算机。
    模拟电子计算机是由电子管和许多元件组成的一种复杂的电子装置，它的用途甚广，可解复杂微分方程和自动调节系统等问题，以及锅炉、汽轮机、飞机、火箭及原子反映堆等复杂的工程设计，它不仅可使脑力劳动者节省大量的计算精力和时间，并可像神经枢纽一样控制中心，对生产过程的综合自动化、对工业建设作用很大。
    在试制的时候，教师、同学的劲头虽很大，但他们对搞尖端科学的信心还是不足的，党委便从多方面给以支持鼓励，如党委书记李清亲自到电工教研组和老师们一起熬夜，党委常委周彬、程云二同志帮他们出主意想办法，就这样在党的支持下，电子计算机终于试制成功。（原侃）
