Factory-Run Schools Are Incredibly Beautiful

    Five Major Benefits: Good Students—from the working class; Good Teachers—able to connect with practice; Good Equipment—having complete sets of production equipment; Good Environment—more conducive to combining education with productive labor than schools; Good Leadership—strong leadership from the factory's Party committee.

    (Reported by our correspondent Li Yunhui) To meet the needs of the technical revolution on the industrial front and the development of the "two participations, one reform" movement in factories, the large-scale establishment of schools by factories has become a new and important feature of the great development of education in our country.

    Currently, tens of thousands of workers across the country are engaged in spare-time studies or part-work, part-study programs in schools run by the factories themselves. They are both workers and students, developing in the direction of eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor. Many workers are also combining production and learning to engage in scientific research, making factories places where production, education, and scientific research are integrated, and important bases for cultivating working-class intellectuals.

    All factories in Jilin Province have established schools, and the workers studying in these schools account for 80% of the city's total workforce. The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory has established a spare-time education system from primary school to university and also manages the pre-school education of workers' children. The factory's workers and their children can solve all their educational needs, from kindergarten to university, without leaving the factory.

    Now, some local Party committees have initially summarized that factory-run schools have five good aspects: good students (from the working class), good teachers (able to connect with practice), good equipment (having complete sets of production equipment), good environment (more conducive to combining education with productive labor than schools), and good leadership (strong leadership from the factory's Party committee). Therefore, factory-run education has a great future.

    The forms of factory-run schools in various places generally take the following forms: first, spare-time schools, which are currently the most common. Shanghai has newly established 840 factory spare-time schools and plans to establish another 918. Second, factories and schools merge, such as the dozens of ordinary middle schools that were merged into newly built and expanded factories in Hebei Province. Third, factories recruit students from outside the factory after establishing schools. Fourth, worker part-work, part-study schools.

    The source of teachers for factory-run schools is generally based on self-reliance, trying to solve the problem from the factory's original cadres; some factories also link up with schools, with schools helping to solve the problem; and some factories have demonstrated a spirit of hard work, with workers studying at universities teaching middle school, and workers studying in middle school teaching primary school. Therefore, some factory Party committees believe that factories running their own schools have many advantages in many respects. The textbooks currently used in various factory schools are mostly the textbooks of ordinary schools, which have been utilized after being "cut," "supplemented," "replaced," and "combined."

    At present, the trend of factory-run schools is flourishing everywhere, and it is warmly supported by the masses of workers.

### 工厂办学  美不胜收

    工厂办学  美不胜收
    五大好处：学生好——工人阶级；教员好——能联系实际；设备好——有整套生产设备；环境好——比学校更便于实行教育与生产劳动相结合；领导好——工厂党的领导强。
    本报讯　记者李蕴辉报道：适应工业战线上技术革命的需要和工厂里“两参一改”运动的开展，各地工厂大办学校，已经成为目前我国教育事业大发展中一个新的重要特征。
    现在，全国各地有数以千、万计的工人，在工厂自己举办的各级、各类学校里，进行着业余学习或半工半读。他们既是工人，又是学生，正朝着消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动差别的方面发展。许多工人还在结合生产、学习，大搞科学研究，使工厂成为生产、教育、科学研究三结合的场所，成为培养工人阶级知识分子的重要阵地。
    吉林省的工厂已经全部兴办了学校，在这些学校里学习的工人，占全市工人总数80％。太原重型机械厂由于建立了由小学到大学的业余教育体系，并且把工人子弟的学前教育也管起来了。这个厂的工人及其子弟，从入幼儿园到进大学，不出工厂的门都可以解决了。
    现在有的地方党委初步总结出工厂办学校有五好：学生好（工人阶级）、教员好（能联系实际）、设备好（有整套生产设备）、环境好（比学校更便于实行教育与生产劳动相结合）、领导好（工厂党的领导强）。因此，工厂办教育前途大有可为。
    各地工厂办学大致采取下列几种形式，一是业余学校，目前这种形式最多，上海市新办起八百四十所工厂业余学校，还准备办九百一十八所。二是工厂和学校合并，如河北省新建和扩建的工厂，曾经并入了几十所普通中学。三是工厂办学后，在厂外招生。四是工人半工半读学校。
    工厂办学的师资来源，一般是以自力更生为主，从厂内原有的干部中设法解决；也有的工厂和学校挂钩，由学校帮助解决；有的工厂更是发挥了苦干精神，由在高等学校学习的工人教中学，在中学学习的工人教小学。因此，有些工厂的党委认为，工厂自己办一套学校，在许多方面都有好处。各工厂学校现用的教材，多是将普通学校的教材，经过“砍”、“补”、“换”、“合”后加以利用。
    目前各地工厂办学校的风气正在方兴未艾，它深受到工人群众的热烈拥护。
