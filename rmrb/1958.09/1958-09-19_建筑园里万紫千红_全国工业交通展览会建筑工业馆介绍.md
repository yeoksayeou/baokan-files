Entering the Construction Industry Hall, you will see a sign with the title "One Factory's Investment Builds Two Factories, Three Years of Design Completed in One Year." It is an encouraging report of the great leap forward in China's construction industry: The investment needed to build a steel plant with an annual output of 600,000 tons during the First Five-Year Plan period can now build two steel plants of the same scale; In the First Five-Year Plan period, it took thirty months to design a cement plant with an annual output of 450,000 tons, but now it only takes ten months to complete.

These are just two examples. Thanks to the valuable experience gained during the First Five-Year Plan period, how much can be saved in actual investment compared to the First Five-Year Plan period for each additional ton of steel production capacity, each additional ton of coal mining capacity, each additional kilowatt of electricity, and each additional kilometer of railway laid during the Second Five-Year Plan period? Here are some preliminary estimates from various industrial sectors:

	Steel: from 1060 yuan to 325 yuan,
	Copper: from 7000-10000 yuan to 3000-3500 yuan,
	Aluminum: from 7400 yuan to 2200 yuan,
	Coal: from 31 yuan to 16 yuan,
	Hydroelectric power: from 1300 yuan to 450-500 yuan,
	Railway: from 566,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan.

Not only can the same amount of money build factories that are two, three, or even more times larger in scale, but the construction time is also much shorter. Building a large-scale steel, automobile, tractor, power generation, or heavy machinery factory of the same scale now takes only half or even less of the time it used to.

A Great Leap Forward in Industrial Design

There is a lot of potential for saving investment and reducing costs in architectural design. The six design institutes directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering alone saved a building investment of 12.45 million yuan during the "Double-Anti" movement, accounting for 32.4% of the original investment. This money can be used to build sixty-one factories producing 1,000 machine tools per year, or 2.81 million square meters of housing.

I heard a vivid comparative example at the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. The preliminary design of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant expansion project, originally designed by the General Institute of Design for Ferrous Metallurgy of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, consisted of forty-five volumes, with the written explanations alone totaling 4,026 pages, amounting to two million words, surpassing two "Dreams of the Red Chamber." Typing and binding alone took twenty people a month of intensive work. The original design of the plant cost an average of 909 yuan per ton of steel production capacity. After repeated debates during the "Double-Anti" movement, the blindly adopted large amounts of new technology and equipment were reduced, and some minor facilities were postponed or not built at all, the investment per ton of production capacity dropped to 430 yuan. The design documents were reduced to only three volumes, with only ninety-eight pages of explanatory text. In the past, it took the design institutes of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry ten months to complete the preliminary design of a medium-sized steel plant, but now it only takes four months to complete the preliminary design of a large steel plant.

What does it mean to build more, faster, better, and more economically in the construction industry? People can understand this question by simply browsing through the charts.

Building Materials Are Changing Rapidly

The cost of building materials accounts for a large proportion of the investment in construction projects. The building materials exhibition section of the Construction Industry Hall shows the rapid development of China's building materials industry, making it possible for China's construction projects to use more, better, and cheaper building materials.

There are many new products of cement, glass, ceramics, bricks and tiles competing with each other. "Cement that makes foreign cement angry," made with local methods, "unbreakable" safety glass, beautiful and clean white ceramic radiators, "light and light" hollow bricks and thin tiles, water and fire-resistant glass fiber as thin as silkworms, glass steel that is harder than steel and lighter than aluminum, rock wool as soft as cotton, "lightweight large bricks that can float on water," etc., many of which are new building materials that have appeared recently in the world or are just beginning to be tested and researched. Most of them are new achievements of the building materials industry during the Great Leap Forward. The common characteristics of these new materials are light weight, high strength, and low price. For example, lightweight large bricks are one-half to two-thirds lighter than ordinary bricks. After full promotion, they can reduce construction costs by 50%. At present, China's building materials are undergoing revolutionary changes, moving towards light weight, high strength, local materials, utilization of waste, and low price. Hundreds of new products have been successfully trial-produced and put into production.

China's construction industry is developing rapidly. From the charts exhibited in this hall, it can be seen that China's cement production is rising in a straight line, and next year's output will overtake Britain's, reaching 27 million tons; during the First Five-Year Plan period, China had only four glass factories, and they all produced flat glass. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, flat glass factories, glass fiber factories, glass steel factories, glass tube factories... will be densely distributed throughout the country.

Construction is Advancing by Leaps and Bounds

The last part of the Construction Industry Hall prominently introduces the technical revolution in the construction industry. The indoor exhibition displays models of various horizontal and vertical transportation machinery, showing the infinite wisdom of the workers. Here, in striking characters, it is announced to the people that construction workers in thirty-one provinces and cities across the country have put down their carrying poles and liberated their shoulders. The Tianjin Construction Engineering Bureau erected a memorial archway with carrying poles, and they posted the couplet "Millennial carrying poles once abandoned, the technical revolution is even more energetic" to express their happy mood and high morale. The machinery created by construction personnel is not limited to transportation. Their wisdom is also shown in welding, installation, earthwork, carpentry, painting, tile work, and plastering. In the outdoor square of the Construction Industry Hall, there are many machines created by construction workers from various places, which complete workloads with an efficiency equivalent to several, dozens, or even more than a hundred times that of manpower. After adopting "local" and "foreign" machinery and rapid construction methods, many construction sites have greatly accelerated the construction speed and reduced project costs. In terms of industrial construction, it is introduced here that Henan completed a large factory building of 27,000 square meters in thirty-eight days, and Shanghai built a seamless steel pipe workshop of 1,700 square meters in three days. Such high construction speed is incomparable in all capitalist countries. The seamless steel pipe workshop built in Shanghai reduced the project cost by 19.14% due to the six-fold increase in speed and the savings in labor and management costs.

On the land of the motherland, industrial flowers of all colors will bloom. The employees of China's construction departments, like the most diligent and shrewd gardeners, are sowing and cultivating with their wisdom and hands.

    建筑园里万紫千红
    ——全国工业交通展览会建筑工业馆介绍
    本报记者　赵春烈
    走进建筑工业馆，就会看到一块标题是“一厂投资建两厂，三年设计一年完”的图板。它是我国建筑工业大跃进的一份令人鼓舞的喜报：第一个五年计划时期建设一座年产六十万吨的钢铁厂的投资，现在可以建设同样规模的钢铁厂两座；在第一个五年计划时期，设计一座年产四十五万吨的水泥厂要三十个月，现在只要十个月就能完成。
    这里仅仅是两个例子。由于有了第一个五年计划期间的宝贵经验，在第二个五年计划期间每增加年产一吨钢的生产能力，每增加年产一吨煤的采掘能力，每增加一瓩电力，每铺设一公里铁路……可以比第一个五年计划期间的实际投资额节省多少呢？下面是各个工业部门的一些初步的估算数字：
    钢，从1060元降到325元，
    铜，从7000至10000元降到3000至3500元，
    铝，从7400元降到2200元，　　煤，从31元降到16元，
    水力发电，从1300元降到450至500元，
    铁路，从56.6万元降到40万元。
    不仅是同样数目的钱可以建成规模大两倍、三倍甚至更多倍的工厂，而且建设时间也短得多。建设一座同样规模的大型钢铁、汽车、拖拉机、发电、重型机器厂，现在只要过去一半或更短的时间。
    工业设计大飞跃
    建筑设计上的节约投资降低造价油水很大。只是建筑工程部直属的六个设计院，在双反运动中就从设计中节约了建筑投资一万二千四百五十万元，占原来投资的32.4％。这些钱可以用来修建年产一千台机床的工厂六十一座，可以建造二百八十一万平方公尺的住宅。
    记者曾在冶金工业部听到这样一个生动的对比例子。冶金部黑色冶金设计总院原来设计的太原钢铁厂扩建工程，初步设计书共四十五卷，只是其中的文字说明就有四千零二十六页，长达二百万字，赛过两部红楼梦。光是打字装订，就由二十个人突击了一个月。这个厂的原设计，平均每吨钢的生产能力投资九百零九元。在双反运动中经过反复辩论，减除了盲目采用的大量新技术装备，缓建或不建一些次要的设施以后，每吨生产能力的投资下降到四百三十元。设计文件经过精简后只有三卷，说明文字才九十八页。过去冶金工业部的设计院设计一个中型钢厂，初步设计要花费十个月工夫，现在一个大型钢厂的初步设计，只要四个月就能完成。
    什么是建筑工业上的多快好省？人们只要粗糙地浏览一下图表就可以明白这个问题。
    建筑材料日新月异
    建筑材料费用在工程建设投资中占着很大比重。建筑工业馆的建筑材料展览部分，可以看出我国建筑材料工业的飞快发展，使我国的建设工程有可能采用更多更好更便宜的建筑材料。
    这里有好多种水泥、玻璃、陶瓷、砖瓦新产品，在互相争艳。“气死洋灰”的土法制成的水泥，“击之不破”的安全玻璃，漂亮洁白的陶瓷暖气片，“轻而又轻”的空心砖和薄型瓦，不怕水火、细如蚕丝的玻璃纤维，比钢硬、比铝轻的玻璃钢，柔软如棉的岩石棉，“可浮于水”的轻质大砖等等，很多都是世界上出现不久或刚开始试验研究的新建筑材料。它们大部分是建筑材料工业部门在大跃进中的新成就。这些新材料的共同特点是重量轻、强度高、价钱低廉。像轻质大砖重量比普通砖轻二分之一到三分之二，全面推广后，可使建筑造价降低50％。目前，我国的建筑材料正起着革命性的变化，它正向着重量轻、强度高、就地取材、利用废料、价钱低廉的方向发展，现在已经试制成功和投入生产的有几百种新产品。
    我国的建筑工业正在一日千里地向前发展。从这个馆展出的图表可以看出，我国水泥产量正在直线上升，明年产量就要赶过英国，达到二千七百万吨；第一个五年计划期间，我国只有四个玻璃工厂，而且都是生产平板玻璃，到第二个五年计划末，平板玻璃厂、玻璃纤维厂、玻璃钢厂、玻璃管厂……将密布全国各地。
    建筑施工一日千里
    建筑工业馆最后一部分突出地介绍了建筑行业中大闹技术革命的情况。室内展出了各式各样的水平运输机械和垂直运输机械的模型，显示了职工群众无穷的智慧。这里用醒目的大字向人们宣布：全国有三十一个省、市的建筑工人已经放下扁担，解放了双肩。天津市建工局用扁担架起了一座牌坊，他们贴上“千年扁担一旦撂，技术革命劲更高”的对联，表达了愉快的心情，高涨的干劲。建筑人员创造的机械不只限于运输，在焊接、安装、土方、木工、油漆、瓦工、抹灰等方面，都表现了他们的智慧。在建筑工业馆的室外广场上，摆满了各地建筑职工创造的机械，它们以相当于人力几倍、几十倍、甚至一百多倍的效率完成着工作量。许多工地在采用“土”、“洋”机械和快速施工方法以后，大大加快了施工速度，降低了工程成本。在工业建设方面，这里介绍了：河南三十八天完成了一座二万七千平方公尺的大型厂房，上海三天建成一座一千七百平方公尺的无缝钢管车间。这样高的施工速度，是世界上一切资本主义国家无法比拟的。上海建成的那个无缝钢管车间，因速度加快了六倍，节省了人工和管理费用，使工程成本降低19.14％。
    在祖国的土地上，将开遍万紫千红的工业之花。我国建筑部门的职工们，就像最勤快、最精明的园丁一样，用他们的智慧和双手，在播种、在栽培。
