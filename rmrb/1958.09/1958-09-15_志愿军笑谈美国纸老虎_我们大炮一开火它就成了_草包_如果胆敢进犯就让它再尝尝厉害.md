Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 14th. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's third batch of returning soldiers, who are about to return victoriously, are paying close attention to the situation in the Taiwan Strait while eagerly laughing and talking about the "paper tiger." They said: If the American imperialists do not remember their惨惨defeat on the Korean battlefield, then let them taste our power again!

    The commanders and fighters of a certain anti-aircraft artillery regiment, who shot down and damaged more than 380 American planes during the Battle of Shangganling and the Battle of Kumsong, said contemptuously at numerous protest rallies: The United States is a complete "teacher," a cowardly bully. At the beginning of the Korean War, it was truly rampant and arrogant; once our cannons opened fire, it became a "good-for-nothing," and one plane after another was shot down like headless flies crashing straight to the ground. Later, these aerial bandits would flee as soon as they spotted anti-aircraft artillery positions. Second-Class Merit Winner Wang Eryuan, a second lieutenant who distinguished himself in the "Old Baldy" battle, said that one night, he and Squad Leader Eight went to the front line to scout. Looking into an enemy bunker through a gun hole, they saw four American devils hiding on the lowest level. One devil pulled a rope tied to a chair, and the heavy machine gun on the firing platform started firing. They followed the rope and saw that the cowardly American soldiers were hiding in the bunker and firing the machine gun with a rope. Soon after, his unit launched an attack on a high ground occupied by the American invading army's 7th Division. They rushed into the enemy's command post and saw a devil with a bloody face lying on the ground pretending to be dead. He gently tapped the devil's head with a grenade, and the devil immediately got up and knelt down, kowtowing.

    What the soldiers enjoyed talking about most was the "standard" surrender actions of the American soldiers: raising their hands high, drooping their heads, kneeling and begging for mercy, and then bowing respectfully to thank us. Xu Fenglin, the company commander of a certain artillery company who, together with his brother artillerymen, killed and wounded an enemy regiment in the summer counterattack of 1953, said: If the American devils do not heed the warnings of the 600 million Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, we are ready to see the ugly faces of American soldiers as prisoners again.

    志愿军笑谈美国纸老虎
    我们大炮一开火它就成了“草包”
    如果胆敢进犯就让它再尝尝厉害
    新华社平壤14日电　即将胜利归国的中国人民志愿军第三批归国部队战士，在密切注意台湾海峡局势的同时，争相笑谈“纸老虎”。他们说：如果美帝国主义不记住在朝鲜战场上的惨败，那就让它再尝尝我们的厉害！
    曾在上甘岭战役和金城反击战中，击落击伤美国飞机三百八十多架的某高射炮团的指战员们，在多次抗议集会上轻蔑地说：美国是一个十足的“教师爷”，欺软怕硬的家伙。朝鲜战争初期，它真是横行霸道，猖狂得不可一世；我们的大炮一开火，它就成了“草包”，一架架飞机被我们打得像没头苍蝇一样往地下直栽。以后这些空中强盗一发现高射炮阵地就赶紧逃之夭夭。在“老秃山”战斗中立过二等功的王二元少尉说，有一天晚上，他和八班长到前沿阵地去侦察，从敌人一个碉堡的枪眼往里瞧，看到四个美国鬼子躲在最下一层，一个鬼子拉了下拴在椅子上的一根绳子，射击台上的重机枪就叫了起来，他们顺着绳看去，原来怕死的美国兵躲在碉堡里用绳子打机关枪。不久，他所在的部队对美国侵略军第七师踞守的一个高地发起了攻击，他们冲进了敌人指挥所，看到一个满脸是血的鬼子躺在地上装死。他用手榴弹往鬼子头上轻轻一敲，这个鬼子连忙起来跪着磕头。
    战士们最高兴谈论的是美国兵“正规”的投降动作：高举双手，搭拉着脑袋，跪着求饶，然后就毕恭毕敬地鞠躬行礼，向我们致谢。在1953年夏季反击战中和兄弟炮兵一起，杀伤敌人一个团的某炮兵连连长徐奉林说：如果美国鬼子不听六亿中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的警告，我们准备再看看美国兵当俘虏的丑相。
