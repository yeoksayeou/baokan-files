　　A Pioneering Undertaking in Running Party Schools

The amateur grassroots Party school established in Chengdu is a pioneering undertaking in the history of Party schools in our country. Moving Party schools to grassroots units and relying on the masses to establish them on a large scale will undoubtedly become an effective way to train worker-peasant Party members quickly, efficiently, and economically.

　　This kind of amateur grassroots Party school adopts the mass line learning method of mutual teaching and learning among the masses, learning from each other's strengths. It gathers the wisdom of the masses to run the school and uses the practical experiences of the masses to educate the masses. This learning method is most suitable for the needs of the worker-peasant masses.

　　We hope that this kind of amateur grassroots Party school will be universally developed throughout the country, and we hope that all parts of the country will create more and better experiences in this regard!

　　办党校的创举
    成都市举办的业余基础党校，是我国办党校史上的一项创举。把党校搬到基层单位中去依靠群众大量兴办，无疑地将成为多快好省地培养工农党员的一种有效的形式。
    这种业余基础党校，采用的是群众互教互学、取长补短的群众路线的学习方法。集群众的智慧来办学校，以群众的实际东西来教育群众。这种学习方法，最适合于工农群众的需要。
    我们希望这种业余基础党校在全国各地普遍发展起来，我们希望全国各地在这方面创造出更多更好的经验！
