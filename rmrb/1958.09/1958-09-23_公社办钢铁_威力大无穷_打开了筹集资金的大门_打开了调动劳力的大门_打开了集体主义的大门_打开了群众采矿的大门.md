    People's Commune-Run Steel Industry: Immense Power
    Opens the Door to Raising Funds
    Opens the Door to Mobilizing Labor
    Opens the Door to Collectivism
    Opens the Door to Mass Mining
    According to the Hebei Daily: The people's communes in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, have vigorously engaged in steel production, demonstrating the superiority of the people's communes in many ways. Before the realization of communization, Xingtai County also adopted many effective measures to vigorously develop the steel industry, but because the societies were small and the strength was weak, the material, financial, and labor resources were limited, resulting in a long-term situation of "slow construction of blast furnaces, few earthen furnaces built, and even less iron produced." At the end of August, seven people's communes were established throughout the county, realizing communization. The county party committee seized this favorable condition and convened a steel production on-site meeting. The seven communes decided on the spot to build 1,246 Jingxing-style earthen furnaces and 80 Yangcheng-style earthen blast furnaces. Immediately, the entire county launched a vigorous and powerful steel production campaign with thousands of horses galloping.

    The facts in Xingtai County prove that the people's communization has opened four doors for the steel industry and resolved contradictions in four aspects:

    (1) The people's communization has opened the door to raising funds, resolving the contradiction of extremely scarce materials. Before the realization of communization, the contradiction between funds and materials needed for large-scale steel production could not be resolved. After the establishment of the people's communes, the situation completely changed. The prefectural committee assigned the county the task of building sixty Yangcheng-style earthen blast furnaces. As soon as the county party committee announced this number, the seven people's communes scrambled for it. The Dongwang People's Commune raised 10,000 yuan in three days to build its own iron smelting plant. Lacking transportation, each commune pooled its resources and extracted 2,000 iron-wheeled carts, 200 rubber-wheeled carts, and more than 1,000 pushcarts. Now, a moving scene of a constant flow of traffic has appeared on each construction site.

    (2) The people's communization has opened the door to mobilizing labor, resolving the contradiction of insufficient cadres. More than 1,000 earthen furnaces and blast furnaces are being built throughout the county, requiring 10,000 laborers. Before communization, it was generally reflected that agricultural cooperatives had too little labor, unable to take care of both agriculture and industry. With the establishment of the people's communes, everyone's thinking broadened, making it possible to ensure both industrial and agricultural production. Within four days of the county party committee's steel production meeting, more than 2,000 laborers throughout the county were投入to furnace construction. The steel front in the county needed 300 cadres, which was impossible to extract in the past. After communization, the seven people's communes in the county extracted 84 people including the township party committee secretaries, township heads, and supply and marketing cooperative directors alone. Many key cadres were also extracted from each village (i.e., production team) to lead the large-scale steel production.

    (3) The people's communization has opened the door to collectivism, resolving the contradiction of a lack of power machinery. Before the realization of communization, agriculture needed donkey engines to pump water for irrigation, and the steel industry needed donkey engines to drive blowers, forming a competition for machinery and dispersing the power of mechanical power. With the people's communes, power machinery can be used for two purposes, being transferred to wherever it is needed urgently, and transferred to the industrial front to combat drought when agriculture is not resisting drought. Nanda Guo Village voluntarily supported the First Iron Smelting Plant with a 7.5-horsepower donkey engine. The fifteen earthen blast furnaces being built by the Yanjia Tun People's Commune can completely solve the power machinery needed by themselves.

    (4) The people's communization has opened the door to mining, resolving the contradiction of a shortage of ore. The county plans to produce 3,320 tons of iron by the end of September, requiring 7,000 to 10,000 tons of ore. In addition to the lean ore in Xihekou, the county also needs to transfer a large amount of ore from Wu'an and Shahe, and a large amount of refractory clay also needs to be transferred from other places. After the formation of people's communes throughout the county, a mass movement to extract treasures from the deep mountains was immediately launched, and more than a dozen iron ore points were quickly discovered. Each commune actively organized the masses to go up the mountains for development.

    公社办钢铁  威力大无穷
    打开了筹集资金的大门
    打开了调动劳力的大门
    打开了集体主义的大门
    打开了群众采矿的大门
    据河北日报消息　河北省邢台县人民公社大搞钢铁，从多方面显示了人民公社的优越性。在没有实现公社化以前，邢台县对大搞钢铁也曾采取了不少有力措施，但因社小、力量小，物力、财力、劳力受限制，长期处于“高炉建的慢，土炉建的少，出铁更少”的局面。8月底，全县成立了七个人民公社，实现了公社化，县委抓住了这一有利条件，就召开了钢铁现场会议。七个公社当场决定建立井陉式土炉一千二百四十六座，阳城式土高炉八十座。全县立即掀起了万马奔腾、声势浩大的大搞钢铁运动。
    邢台县的事实证明：人民公社化给钢铁工业打开了四个大门，解决了四个方面的矛盾：
    （一）人民公社化打开了筹集资金的大门，解决了物料十分缺少的矛盾。在未实现公社化以前，大搞钢铁所需的资金和物料的矛盾解决不了。人民公社成立后，情况完全变了。地委分配这县建设六十个阳城式土高炉。县委一公布这个数字，七个人民公社争着要。东汪人民公社为了建立自己的炼铁厂，三天集资一万元。没有交通运输工具，各公社一凑，就抽调出二千辆铁轮大车，二百辆胶轮大车，一千多辆排子车。现在各工地上出现了车水马龙的动人景象。
    （二）人民公社打开了动员劳力的大门，解决了干部不足的矛盾。全县建立土炉高炉一千多个，需要劳力一万人。没公社化以前，普遍反映农业社劳力少，顾农顾不了工。成立了人民公社，大家的思想领域大开，作到了工业农业生产两不误。在县委钢铁会议后四天时间，全县投入建炉的劳力达二千余个。全县钢铁战线上需干部三百名，过去根本抽不出来，公社化后，全县七个人民公社，光抽出乡党委书记、乡长、供销社主任就达八十四人，各村（即生产队）也抽出很多主要干部领导大搞钢铁生产。
    （三）人民公社打开了集体主义的大门，解决了动力机械缺乏的矛盾。在实现公社化以前，农业要锅驼机抽水浇地，钢铁工业要锅驼机带鼓风机，形成互相争机器，分散了机械动力的力量。有了人民公社，动力机器可以一顶两用，哪里紧急调到哪里去，农业不抗旱就调到工业战线抗旱。南大郭村主动把一台七点五马力锅驼机支持第一炼铁厂。晏家屯人民公社正建的十五座土高炉，所需动力机器能完全自己解决。
    （四）人民公社打开了采矿的大门，解决了矿石不足的矛盾。全县到9月底计划出铁三千三百二十吨，需要矿石七千至一万吨。全县除西河口有贫矿石外，还需要从武安、沙河调入大批矿石，大批的耐火土也需要从外地调。全县公社化形成后，立即展开了群众性的深山取宝运动，很快发现了十多个铁矿点，各公社纷纷组织群众上山开发。
