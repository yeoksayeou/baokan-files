The teachers and students of Shenyang Pharmaceutical College, under the slogan of "Planting leap forward red flags, launching scientific research satellites, and dedicating gifts to the National Day," worked day and night and successfully trial-produced dioscorea saponin and progesterone.

Dioscorea saponin is the main raw material for manufacturing valuable drugs such as progesterone and cortisone (corticosteroids). Progesterone is an effective medicine for treating habitual abortion in women; cortisone has good therapeutic effects on more than 20 diseases, such as severe burns, peritonitis, acute rheumatic fever, and special toxic pneumonia that is ineffective with antibiotic treatment. Because of the lack of dioscorea saponin, China could not produce these two drugs and relied entirely on imports. In the past, capitalist countries monopolized this raw material and would not sell it to us. However, it cannot defeat us. Shenyang Pharmaceutical College, in cooperation with Northeast Pharmaceutical General Factory, successfully extracted dioscorea saponin from a Chinese medicine produced in large quantities in the Northeast. The purity is very good, and the quality has reached the highest international standards. Northeast Pharmaceutical General Factory has decided to officially put it into production recently.

The progesterone successfully trial-produced by the teachers and students after ten days of hard work is also comparable in quality to that of capitalist countries. By the end of this month, the teachers and students will also trial-produce cortisone.

    难不倒我们
    沈阳药学院的教师和学生，在“插跃进红旗，放科研卫星，向国庆节献礼”的口号下，昼夜苦战，试制成功了薯芋皂甙元和黄体酮。
    薯芋皂甙元是制造黄体酮、可地松（皮质激素）等贵重药品的主要原料。黄体酮是治疗妇女习惯性流产的特效药；可地松对严重火烧伤、腹膜炎、急性风湿性热和抗生素治疗无效的特种毒性肺炎等二十多种病症，治疗都有良效。这两种药品，因为缺乏薯芋皂甙元，我国不能生产，完全靠进口。过去资本主义国家拢断这种原料，不卖给我们。但是，它难不倒我们。沈阳药学院与东北制药总厂协作，从东北大量生产的一种中药中，成功地提取出薯芋皂甙元，纯度很好，质量达到国际最高标准，东北制药总厂已决定最近正式投入生产。
    师生们苦干十天，试制成功的黄体酮，质量也可以与资本主义国家的媲美。本月底师生们还将试出可地松。
