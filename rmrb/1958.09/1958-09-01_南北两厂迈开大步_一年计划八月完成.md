Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 31st: The Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory, which fully started production in March this year, has reached its designed capacity thirteen months ahead of schedule and has recently completed its annual state plan ahead of schedule and beyond the target.

When Chairman Mao visited this factory in March this year, he gave the workers great encouragement. At that time, all the factory employees were determined to work hard and achieve greater results to report the good news to Chairman Mao. As a result, their output in April was equal to the total output from January to March. Since then, the monthly production plans have been overfulfilled.

The close combination of technical innovation and current production is an important factor for the Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory to complete the production plan ahead of schedule and beyond the target. Up to now, the factory employees have put forward more than 100,000 innovation proposals around the current production problems, and more than 95% of the workers have broken through their quotas. In order to support the ball bearing conversion in rural areas, the tool workshop recently accepted the task of manufacturing eighty grinding machines. The employees adopted the method of technical innovation, they boldly changed the steel structure to a iron-wood structure, and worked hard for thirty-six hours to produce the first grinding machine.

In order to give full play to the existing production potential, the Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory has also adopted revolutionary measures such as "management combined with repair, repair combined with manufacturing," and workshops and departments running small factories. The original machine repair workshop boldly "upgraded" to a machine tool workshop, which can produce 382 sets of machine equipment of 56 kinds annually, with an output value of 3 million yuan. The workshops and departments also set up more than 40 factories to directly serve the workshop production.

The implementation of workers participating in management and cadres working alongside the workers has further stimulated the enthusiasm of the employees.

Now, all the factory employees have high production enthusiasm and full of energy, and are preparing to push the completion of the plan to a new peak with greater achievements this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 31st: The Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory has overcome the difficulties of raw materials. Since the beginning of this year, it has manufactured more than 1,300 machine tools, and has completed this year's state plan four months ahead of schedule.

The steel materials needed for the production of machine tools in this factory were originally in short supply. In order to produce a large number of machine tools quickly, they used a variety of measures such as digging up waste steel, improving product design, and innovating technology to overcome the difficulties of raw materials. They dug out 115 sets of equipment such as machine tools, water pumps, electric motors, grinding machines, and cranes, and 104 tons of waste steel. They also used indigenous and foreign methods to build a small shed into a steelmaking furnace, which solved the problem of 400 tons of castings and equipment needed for the annual production leap forward plan. The steel saved from the improvement of product design can be used to make more than 100 machine tools. Therefore, it has ensured that the factory has overfulfilled the production tasks every month since the beginning of this year, and the output of machine tools has increased by nearly two times from January to August compared with the same period last year.

At present, the employees of this factory have proposed to ensure that they will complete more than 72% of the annual production leap forward plan in September in order to welcome the National Day.

　　南北两厂迈开大步
    一年计划八月完成
    据新华社成都31日电 今年3月份全面投入生产的成都量具刃具厂已提前十三个月达到了设计能力，并且在最近提前超额完成了今年全年的国家计划。
    毛主席在今年3月来这个厂参观的时候，给了工人莫大的鼓舞。当时全厂职工就下了决心要大干一场作出更大的成绩向毛主席报喜。结果，他们在4月份完成的产量等于1到3月份的总和。此后，每月的生产计划都超额完成。
    把技术革新同当前生产紧密结合起来这是成都量具刃具厂所以能提前超额完成生产计划的重要因素。到目前为止，全厂职工围绕当前生产问题已经提出了十多万件革新建议，全厂95％以上的工人都突破了自己的定额。为了支援农村滚珠轴承化，最近工具车间接受了制造八十台研磨机的任务。职工们采取了技术革新的途径，他们大胆地把钢铁结构改为铁木结构，苦战三十六小时便制成了第一台研磨机。
    为了充分发挥现有的生产潜力，量具刃具厂还采取了“管理兼修理、修理兼制造”，以及车间、科室大办小型工厂的革命措施。原来的机修车间大胆“升格”为机床车间以后，可以年产五十六种共三百八十二台机器设备，产值达三百万元。各车间、科室也办了四十几个工厂，直接为车间生产服务。
    实行工人参加管理和干部跟班劳动，也进一步发挥了职工的积极性。
    现在，全厂职工生产热情高涨、干劲十足，准备在今年内再以更大的成绩把完成计划的指标推向新的高峰。
    据新华社沈阳31日电沈阳第三机床厂战胜原材料困难，今年以来制造出一千三百多台机床，已提前四个月完成今年国家计划。
    这个厂生产机床所需的钢铁材料，原来很不足。为了迅速大量地生产机床，他们用挖掘废钢铁、改进产品设计、革新技术等多项措施，战胜了原材料困难。他们挖出了机床、水泵、电动机、砂轮机、吊车等设备一百一十五台和废钢铁一百零四吨，并且把这些废旧材料用土洋结合的办法，搭个小棚子建成了一座炼钢炉，解决了全年增产跃进计划所需的四百吨铸件和设备问题。从产品设计上的改进，节约的钢材可以做出一百多台机床。因而，保证了这个厂今年以来月月超额完成生产任务，使机床产量1到8月比去年同时期提高了近两倍。
    目前，这个工厂的职工们为迎接国庆节，提出保证在9月份完成全年生产跃进计划72％以上。
