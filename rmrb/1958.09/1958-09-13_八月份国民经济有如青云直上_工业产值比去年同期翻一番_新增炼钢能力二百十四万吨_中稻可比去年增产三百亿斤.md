Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: The execution of the national economic plan in August indicates that the central and local leadership focused on industry, first concentrating on the iron and steel and machinery industries, which has spurred a nationwide movement centered on achieving 10.7 million tons of steel, marking a new stage in the great leap forward of industrial production growth.

According to figures provided by the State Statistical Bureau, the total value of industrial output in August increased by 14% compared to the previous month and doubled compared to the same period last year, making it the month with the fastest growth rate this year. The cumulative total output value from January to August increased by 47% compared to the same period last year.

The production and capital construction of the iron and steel industry have begun an unprecedented leap forward. Compared to the previous month, steel production in August increased by 15%, steel products by 4.2%, and pig iron by 10%. The newly added steelmaking capacity in August was 2.14 million tons, exceeding the total newly added capacity from January to July by 60%. From January to August, 974 steelmaking converters have been built nationwide, with Gansu and Guangxi provinces building the most. A total of 240,000 iron-smelting blast furnaces have been built nationwide, with over 190,000 of them built in August alone. Among the newly built iron-smelting blast furnaces, 98% are indigenous blast furnaces, with Henan Province having the most, reaching over 35,000. More than 60,000 of the newly built iron-smelting blast furnaces in various regions have been put into production.

The speed at which the machinery industry is rushing to manufacture smelting equipment is accelerating. The output of blast furnaces, converters, and rolling mills all increased significantly in August. The production of blowers alone reached 4,400 units, exceeding the total output from January to July. The national machinery industry produced 10,000 various machine tools in August, an increase of over 70% compared to the previous month.

The national electricity output in August increased by 100 million kilowatt-hours compared to the previous month. The national generator output in August was 86,000 kilowatts, of which hydro and steam turbines accounted for 58,500 kilowatts. The cumulative newly added power generation capacity from January to August was 878,000 kilowatts.

The growth of other major industrial products in August compared to the previous month is as follows: raw coal increased by 13.3%, crude oil increased by 14.1%, and copper increased by 5.3%.

"When the sun sets, it is flat ground; when the sun rises, there are factory buildings." New records of high-speed construction continue to emerge in capital construction. Beijing built a seamless steel pipe workshop with a brick and wood structure of 1,464 square meters in eighteen hours, Shanghai built a foundry workshop of 680 square meters in five and a half hours, and Yunnan Province built a foundry workshop of 1,098 square meters with a mixed structure in twenty-two hours.

The State Statistical Bureau's August report provides the following brief information on agriculture, transportation, and commerce:

(1) In terms of grain production, various regions are currently harvesting mid-season rice. It is estimated that the total national output will reach over 113 billion jin, an increase of more than 30 billion jin compared to last year, a growth of about 40%; the yield per mu can reach about 730 jin, an increase of about 75% compared to last year.

The transplanting of double-cropping late rice has been completed. According to statistics from twelve late rice-producing areas in the south, the sowing area of late rice reached a total of 162.5 million mu, an increase of more than 21 million mu compared to 1957.

In order to create conditions for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year, from summer to the end of August, sixteen provinces and cities have deep-plowed over 56 million mu of cultivated land, and twenty-two provinces and cities have accumulated 50 trillion jin of fertilizer (including native fertilizer and various miscellaneous fertilizers). The agricultural tool reform movement centered on ball bearingization is developing vigorously. As of the end of August, over 220 million pieces of improved agricultural tools have been promoted nationwide; over 16 million pieces of agricultural tools have been equipped with ball bearings, and 403 counties and cities nationwide have basically achieved ball bearingization.

(2) In terms of transportation, railway freight volume in August increased by 40.3% compared to the same period last year, and the freight volume of rivers and seas directly under the Ministry of Communications increased by 16.2% compared to the same period last year.

(3) In terms of commerce, the total retail sales of social commodities increased by 14% compared to the same period last year and 7.5% compared to the previous month. Prices continue to remain stable.

    八月份国民经济有如青云直上
    工业产值比去年同期翻一番
    新增炼钢能力二百十四万吨
    中稻可比去年增产三百亿斤
    新华社12日讯　8月份国民经济计划执行情况表明：中央和各地的领导重点放到工业方面，并且首先抓紧钢铁和机械工业，已经在全国范围内促成了一个为实现一千零七十万吨钢为中心的全民运动，工业生产增长的速度，进入了大跃进以来的新阶段。
    根据国家统计局提供的数字，8月份工业生产总值比上月增长14％，比去年同期增长达一倍，是今年增长速度最快的一个月。1至8月累计总产值比去年同期增长47％。
    钢铁工业的生产和基本建设开始了前所未有的跃进速度。8月份比上月，钢产量增长15％，钢材增长4.2％，生铁增长10％。8月份新增炼钢能力二百一十四万吨，超过1至7月份新增能力总和60％。在1至8月份里，全国已建成炼钢转炉九百七十四座，以甘肃、广西两地建成最多。全国已建成炼铁高炉二十四万座，其中8月份建成的就有十九万多座。新建炼铁高炉中，98％是土高炉，以河南省最多，达三万五千多座。各地新建成的炼铁高炉已有六万多座投入了生产。
    机械工业赶制冶炼设备的速度正在加快。8月份高炉、转炉、轧钢机的产量都有很大增长，单是鼓风机就生产了四千四百台，超过了1—7月份产量的总和。全国机械工业在8月份生产了各种机床一万台，比上月增长70％以上。
    8月份全国电力产量比上月增加一亿度。8月份全国发电机产量为八·六万瓩，其中水轮及汽轮发电机为五·八五万瓩。1—8月累计新增发电能力八七·八万瓩。
    8月份其他主要工业产品比上月增长的情况是：原煤增长13.3％，原油增长14.1％，铜增长5.3％。
    “日落是平地，日出现厂房”，基本建设不断出现高速施工的新纪录。北京市以十八小时建成一座一千四百六十四平方公尺砖木结构的无缝钢管车间，上海市以五小时半建成一座六百八十平方公尺的铸工车间，云南省用二十二小时建成一千零九十八平方公尺混合结构的铸工车间。
    国家统计局提供的8月份报告中，关于农业、交通运输和商业方面的简要情况如下：
    （一）粮食生产，目前各地正在收割中稻，预计全国总产量可达一千一百三十亿斤以上，比去年增加三百多亿斤，增长40％左右；亩产可以达到七百三十斤左右，比去年增加75％左右。
    双季晚稻插秧工作已经结束。据南方十二个晚稻产区的统计，晚稻的播种面积共达一万六千二百五十万亩，比1957年增加了二千一百多万亩。
    为了给明年农业生产更大的跃进创造条件，自夏季以来到8月底止，十六个省、市已经进行深翻的耕地达五千六百多万亩，二十二个省、市积肥已达五十万亿斤（包括土肥和各种杂肥）。以滚珠轴承化为中心的农具改革运动正在蓬勃开展。截至8月底，全国已经推广改良农具二亿二千多万件；安装滚珠轴承的农具一千六百多万件，全国已有四百零三个县市基本上实现了滚珠轴承化。
