    A Precious Gift
    At a time when steel production is extremely tight, news has come from the employees of the Jingxi Coal Mine and the Kailuan Coal Mine with a communist style, they are determined to produce more raw coal for the country, and decided not to take holidays on National Day to support the steel marshal's ascension to command, powerfully answering the military provocations and war threats of American imperialism. After reading this news, we would like to pay tribute to the advanced actions of the comrades of Jingxi and Kailuan Coal Mines with such a high degree of socialist consciousness.
    National Day is a great festival for the people of our country. In order to greet this festival, employees of many departments are dedicating gifts to National Day with intensive battles, creative labor, and selfless work. Coal miners are using the National Day holiday to continue production as usual, ensuring the urgently needed fuel supply on the steel front, which is a very valuable gift of historical significance. Our coal miners now produce 710,000 tons of coal per day. Two days of holidays could increase the country's coal production by more than 1.4 million tons. It is estimated that using this coal as fuel could supply blast furnaces to produce more than 350,000 tons of steel. At present, the task of steel production is very heavy. To be sure of completing the steel production target of 10.7 million tons, all parties must cooperate and go all out. Coking coal production directly affects steel production. When millions of small blast furnaces are established, the demand for coal is very high. If the supply of coking coal falls short of demand, then thousands of blast furnaces will be in danger of "shutting down." Therefore, under the command of the Steel Marshal, the coal industry and transportation industry must whip their horses and leap forward.
    Our coal miners and transport workers have a glorious tradition of breaking with convention to celebrate festivals in the past years. We clearly remember that during the Spring Festival of 1957, when the national coal supply was unprecedentedly tight, the national coal mine employees enthusiastically responded to the call of the State Council, gave up two days of holidays, and increased the country's coal production by more than 450,000 tons, which greatly alleviated the tension in the coal supply at that time. Our transport workers, in the years of the Liberation War and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, bore the extremely difficult, heavy, and tense task of supporting the front lines, rushing day and night on the transport lines, and countless heroic deeds such as the "Iron Transport Soldiers" emerged.
    Now, the Steel Marshal requires that the grain and fodder go first. Can the workers on our coal and transport front inherit the past traditions? The answer is yes. The workers of Jingxi and Kailuan Coal Mines have already consciously acted under the orders of the marshal, and the transport workers in Shanghai and other places have also taken action. The working class is the most visionary and the most advanced class. They are able to consider and deal with personal issues by prioritizing production and work, prioritizing long-term interests and overall interests. Therefore, giving up personal holidays is insignificant to individuals, while striving to increase production for the country every minute and every second and striving to achieve industrialization in a short period of time is a great honor.
    We believe that the communist labor enthusiasm of the employees of enterprises such as Jingxi Coal Mine is very valuable. We hope that the leaders of enterprises cherish this enthusiasm, pay attention to safe production, and arrange working hours in a planned way without affecting production, so that workers can take turns to rest, so that they can always maintain full combat enthusiasm and make greater contributions to production.

    珍贵的献礼
    在钢铁生产十分紧张的时候，传来了京西煤矿和开滦煤矿的职工的富有共产主义风格的消息，他们决心为国家多产原煤，决定在国庆节不休假，支援钢铁元帅升帐，有力地回答美帝国主义的军事挑衅和战争威胁。看了这个消息，我们特向京西和开滦煤矿的同志们这种高度社会主义觉悟的先进行动致敬。
    国庆节是我国人民的伟大的节日。为了迎接这个节日，许多部门的职工都以紧张的战斗，创造性的劳动，忘我的工作，为国庆节献礼。煤矿工人利用国庆节日，照常生产，保证钢铁战线上急需的燃料供应，这是一项极有历史意义的珍贵礼品。我们的煤矿工人现在日产煤为七十一万吨，两天假日就能为国家增产一百四十多万吨煤炭；据估计，用这些煤炭作燃料，约可供给高炉炼出三十五万多吨钢铁。目前，钢铁生产任务十分繁重，要确有把握地完成一千零七十万吨的钢产任务，必须各方面协同动作，全力以赴。焦煤的生产是直接影响着钢铁生产的，当千百万小高炉建立以后，煤炭的需要量很大，如果焦煤供不应求，那末，成千上万的高炉就有“停火”的危险。因此，在钢帅的指挥下，煤炭工业、运输事业都必须快马加鞭突飞猛进地赶上去。
    我国的煤矿工人和运输工人们，在过去的年月里，是有着打破常规过节日的光荣传统的。我们清楚地记得：在1957年的春节，在全国煤炭供应空前紧张的情况下，全国煤矿职工热烈地响应了国务院的号召，放弃了两天休假日，为国家增产了四十五万多吨煤炭，使当时煤炭供应的紧张程度大大减轻。我们的运输工人们，在解放战争和抗美援朝的年代里，负担着极其艰巨、繁重而紧张的支援前线任务，日日夜夜奔波在运输线上，出现了“钢铁运输兵”等无数可歌可泣的英勇事迹。
    现在，钢帅要求粮草先行。我们的煤炭和运输战线上的工人们能不能继承过去的传统呢？回答是肯定的。京西和开滦煤矿的工人们已经在元帅的命令下自觉地行动起来了，上海等地的运输工人们也已经行动起来了。工人阶级是最有远见的、最先进的阶级，他们是能够以生产和工作为重，以长远利益和整体利益为重来考虑和处理个人问题。所以，放弃个人假日，对个人说来则是微不足道的事情，而争取每分每秒的时间为国家增加生产，争取在短时期内实现工业化却是极大的荣誉。
    我们认为京西煤矿等企业职工们的共产主义劳动热情是十分可贵的。希望企业的领导人员爱护这种热情，注意安全生产；并在不影响生产的条件下，有计划地安排工作时间，让工人们轮流休息，使他们永远保持饱满的战斗热情，在生产上作出更大的贡献。
