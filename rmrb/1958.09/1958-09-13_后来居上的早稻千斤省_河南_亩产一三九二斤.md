Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 12th: Henan has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of early rice, with per-mu yield exceeding the three "thousand-jin provinces" of Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu, becoming a latecomer among the nation's "thousand-jin provinces" for early rice.

This year, Henan Province's early rice planting area was over 3,983,300 mu, with a total harvest of 5,544,980,000 jin of dried grain, achieving an average per-mu yield of over 1,392 jin. Compared with the highest annual early rice output in Henan's history in 1957, the total output increased by more than 4.35 billion jin, and the unit area yield increased by more than threefold.

According to statistics, the average per-mu yield of 3,270,000 mu of early rice in the three special districts of Xinyang, Shangqiu, and Luoyang in Henan Province reached 1,500 jin to 1,616 jin. There are sixty-two counties and cities in the province with an average per-mu yield of over 1,000 jin, including Xiping and Bo'ai. Among them, Shangcheng County, which had suffered disasters for years in the past, has seen a particularly astonishing increase in early rice production this year, with the average per-mu yield of 150,000 mu of early rice in the county reaching 2,500 jin. The income from one season of early rice almost exceeds the county's total grain output for two years. In the old revolutionary base area of Xin County in the Dabie Mountains, 57,300 mu of early rice also yielded over 1,000 jin per mu.

This year, half of the 3,980,000 mu of early rice in Henan Province was newly planted rice in new rice-growing areas for the first time. These rice paddies are mostly distributed in the Xinxiang, Kaifeng, Shangqiu, and Luoyang areas along the Yellow River, and are mostly saline-alkali sandy wasteland and low-lying, flood-prone land that did not grow crops in the past. However, the yield of these new rice paddies is very high, generally ranging from 800 to 1,000 jin per mu. From this, we can see the characteristics of Henan's early rice production this year: large area, high yield, and bumper harvests everywhere, whether in mountainous areas, plains, or sandy alkaline depressions, with high yields everywhere.

### 后来居上的早稻千斤省  河南——亩产一三九二斤

    后来居上的早稻千斤省
    河南——亩产一三九二斤
    据新华社郑州12日电　河南早稻大面积丰收，亩产量超过湖北、安徽、江苏等三个千斤省，成为全国后来居上的早稻千斤省。
    今年河南省早稻播种面积是三百九十八万三千三百多亩，共收干谷五十五亿四千四百九十八万斤，平均亩产达到一千三百九十二斤多。与河南省历史上最高年产量1957年的早稻产量比较，总产量提高四十三亿五千多万斤；单位面积产量提高三倍多。
    据统计，河南省信阳、商丘和洛阳三个专区三百二十七万亩早稻，平均亩产达到一千五百斤到一千六百一十六斤。全省平均亩产达到千斤以上的县、市有西平、博爱等六十二个。其中，商城县过去连年遭灾，今年早稻增产特别惊人，全县十五万亩早稻平均亩产二千五百斤。一季早稻收入几乎超过这个县两年粮食产量的总和。大别山区革命老根据地的新县，五万七千三百亩早稻也亩产双千斤。
    今年河南省的三百九十八万多亩早稻，有一半是第一次试种水稻的新稻区。这些稻田大都分布在黄河两岸的新乡、开封、商丘、洛阳地区，并且多是过去不长庄稼的盐碱沙荒和低洼易涝地。但是这些新稻田的产量都很高，一般亩产量都在八百到一千斤。从这里可以看到今年河南早稻生产的特点：面积大，产量高，不论山区、平原或沙碱洼地块块丰收，处处高产。
