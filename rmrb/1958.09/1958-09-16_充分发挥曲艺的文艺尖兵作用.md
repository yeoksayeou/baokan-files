    Fully Develop the Role of Quyi as a Literary and Artistic Vanguard
    The Ministry of Culture's National Quyi Work Conference, the First National Quyi Performance, and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles' National Quyi Workers' Representative Conference have all successfully concluded. These three conferences summarized the achievements of China's Quyi work over the past nine years, exchanged experiences from various regions, and clarified the direction and tasks of Quyi work in the future. After the conferences, the Chinese Quyi Workers Association was established. The holding of these conferences is conducive to the development and prosperity of new socialist Quyi in the future.
    Quyi is one of China's folk arts with a long history and tradition, with broad mass appeal and strong national characteristics. Most Quyi artists come from poor backgrounds and have been oppressed. The audience is also mostly working people. Although some Quyi forms have been influenced by feudal and bourgeois culture in cities, and have been contaminated with unhealthy elements, generally speaking, Quyi comes from the people, takes root in the people, and has always been one of the folk arts loved by the broad masses of working people. Although some Quyi forms or parts of programs have gradually developed into novels and operas, Quyi itself still maintains its independent existence due to its own characteristics. It is an indispensable part of the cultural life of the working people of our country.
    Under the guidance of the correct policy put forward by the Party of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, Quyi work has achieved new development in recent years, and has played a great role in carrying out political propaganda and ideological education among the masses. It is fully justified that Quyi is called a "literary and artistic vanguard" and a "light cavalry." In the amateur artistic activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers, Quyi has become one of the most popular art forms. The broad masses of Quyi artists have been respected in the new society, and their ideological and artistic levels have been improved. Traditional Quyi forms have been renovated, and traditional programs have been reorganized and have appeared with a new look. Under the situation of the great leap forward in production, many Quyi artists have gone up the mountains, down to the factories, down to the countryside, and down to the troops to perform, so that Quyi actively serves socialist construction.
    The three conferences unanimously decided that in the future, Quyi work should continue to implement the policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, strive to develop creations reflecting the new era and new life, actively reorganize excellent traditional programs, coordinate with the struggle for production, strengthen ties with the masses, give full play to the role of literary and artistic vanguard, and serve socialist construction more powerfully. This is correct.
    In order to achieve this task, it is first necessary to greatly develop and gradually improve the creation of new Quyi. The characteristics of Quyi form are short and concise, and one or two people can perform, which is not only convenient for quickly reflecting life and serving politics, but also convenient for connecting with the masses and going deep into the masses. Therefore, Quyi must be made a powerful tool for serving production construction and socialist revolution. Today's Quyi is no longer something to provide leisure and entertainment for the exploiting classes, but a weapon to inspire production enthusiasm and improve the communist moral spirit of the working people. It should praise and sing the praises of advanced figures on all fronts, new things and new customs in life, and criticize and attack backward and reactionary phenomena. Many such new Quyi have already appeared, and there are many excellent works among them. Of course, some are still relatively poor in quality and need to be improved, but that is not surprising. Their direction is correct, and they should be further developed, vigorously supported, cherished, and encouraged, rather than being despised. The broad masses welcome Quyi that reflects real life in a timely manner and sings the praises of their own new life. If there is a lack of such programs, and only old programs, it will inevitably be divorced from the masses.
    People who do not pay enough attention to new Quyi or even take a contemptuous attitude towards it are roughly of two types: foreign dogmatists think that Quyi is not worthy of being considered literature and art, which is an aristocratic master attitude of despising mass literature and art. The other is a native dogmatist who values the old and despises the new, and is full of conservative ideas, thinking that new Quyi always can't catch up with old Quyi. This is an art antiquarian. They are actually all for art for art's sake. Of course, we must also oppose the style of shoddy work, which will affect the reputation of new Quyi among the audience. Such creators seem to value Quyi creation on the surface, but in essence they still despise it. We must not only greatly develop new Quyi creation, but also gradually improve the quality of creation.
    On the one hand, it is necessary to give full play to the special characteristics of Quyi, so that it can quickly reflect reality, serve politics, and create a large number of programs with current real life as the theme; on the other hand, it is also necessary to actively reorganize and perform excellent traditional programs, inherit and develop excellent performance skills. As long as many traditional programs are stripped of their dross, they can still meet the healthy cultural life requirements of the audience, and the heroic figures in historical legends are still objects of praise and learning. Such works are undoubtedly our precious cultural heritage. As for the excellent traditional artistic skills, they should also be learned and inherited, which is an indispensable condition for the development of new Quyi. However, there are also some traditional art forms and skills, which are either originally dross or have lost their vitality, and need to be boldly reformed and broken through. Sticking to conventions cannot maintain the life of traditional art, on the contrary, it will only make it wither and die.
    The completion of the task also requires relying on the strength of the masses. It is necessary to greatly develop amateur Quyi workers in factories, cooperatives, troops, and schools, so that the Quyi team can be further expanded. There are currently about 50,000 Quyi artists in the country. To carry out work in a popular and in-depth manner, such a number is naturally not enough. This requires attaching importance to amateur forces, combining professional and amateur, and expanding the team to 500,000 or 5 million people. Worker-peasant-soldier amateur Quyi creators and performers, because they live and fight in their own work posts, are familiar with the lives of the masses, and have personal experience and deep feelings, will have advantages that professional workers do not easily have in both writing and performance. Amateur Quyi workers should of course learn from professional workers in order to improve their artistic level; professional workers must also humbly learn and absorb the experience and strengths of amateur workers. Only when professional and amateur are combined, and professional is developed on the basis of amateur, so that professional workers have a large reserve army of amateur workers, can Quyi work be more prosperous.
    In addition, to further develop Quyi work, it is also necessary to absorb a group of new literary and artistic workers to join this team. In recent years, many new literary and artistic workers have joined the opera team, which has greatly developed opera. Similarly, in order to better improve and innovate, and more effectively reorganize and inherit traditional programs and artistic skills. Quyi work also requires more writers, musicians, and performing artists to participate in various aspects of the work, help professional artists, learn from them, and carry out research, creation, and reform work.
    Quyi artists themselves must improve their political and cultural levels, and combine ideological transformation to eliminate backward habits. Due to the reasons of the old society, some artists have not yet gotten rid of illiteracy, and literacy work is urgently needed.
    China's amateur, professional, and semi-professional Quyi workers are a mass literary and artistic army. They are connected with the broad masses, and their work affects the ideological quality of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, and affects the social moral customs. Therefore, party committees and cultural departments at all levels should pay close attention to them, value them, lead them, and give full play to their strength. This is a huge propaganda team that can contribute to socialist construction. We believe that all Quyi workers, under the care and leadership of the Party, organized, strengthened unity, more closely combined with the working people, and gave greater play to their creativity and enthusiasm, will surely complete their tasks, and make the new socialist Quyi bloom with beautiful and colorful flowers!

### 充分发挥曲艺的文艺尖兵作用

    充分发挥曲艺的文艺尖兵作用
    文化部举行的全国曲艺工作会议和第一届全国曲艺会演，以及中国文联召开的全国曲艺工作者代表大会，已经先后胜利闭幕了。这三个会，总结了我国曲艺工作九年来的成绩，交流了各地的经验，明确了今后曲艺工作的方针和任务。会后，成立了中国曲艺工作者协会。这几个会的举行是有利于今后社会主义新曲艺的发展和繁荣的。
    曲艺是我国具有悠久历史传统的民间艺术之一，具有广泛的群众性和浓厚的民族特色。曲艺艺人大都是出身贫苦，受过压迫。听众也多数是劳动人民。尽管某些曲种在城市中受到封建阶级和资产阶级文化的影响，染上不健康的东西；但是，整个地说来，曲艺来自民间，在民间生根，始终是广大劳动人民所喜爱的民间艺术之一。尽管某些曲种或者部分节目，也有逐渐发展为小说和戏曲的，但是曲艺本身仍然由于它具有自己的特点，而保持其独立的存在。它是我国劳动人民的文化生活中一个不可缺少的部分。
    在党所提出的文艺为工农兵服务和百花齐放、推陈出新的正确方针指导下，几年来曲艺工作获得了新的发展，在对群众进行政治宣传和思想教育方面，发挥了很大的力量。曲艺被称为“文艺尖兵”和“轻骑队”是有充分理由的。在工农群众业余艺术活动中，曲艺已经成为最普遍的艺术形式之一。广大曲艺艺人在新社会中受到了尊重，他们的思想水平和艺术水平有了提高。传统曲种经过革新，传统曲目经过整理后，已经以崭新的面貌出现。在生产大跃进的形势下，许多曲艺艺人上山下厂下乡下部队，进行演出，使曲艺积极地为社会主义建设服务。
    三个会议一致决定，今后曲艺工作应该在继续贯彻文艺为工农兵服务和百花齐放、推陈出新的方针下，努力发展反映新时代新生活的创作，并积极整理优秀的传统节目，应该配合生产斗争，加强联系群众，充分发挥文艺尖兵的作用，更加有力地为社会主义建设服务。这是正确的。
    为了实现这个任务，首先必须大量发展并逐步提高新曲艺的创作。曲艺形式的特点是短小精悍，一、二人便能演出，既便于迅速反映生活，为政治服务，又便于联系群众，深入群众。因此，必须使曲艺成为为生产建设、为社会主义革命服务的有力工具。今天的曲艺早已不是供给剥削阶级消闲解闷的东西，而是鼓舞生产热情、提高劳动人民的共产主义道德精神的武器。它应该表扬和歌颂各个战线上的先进人物、生活中的新事物新风气，批评和打击落后和反动的现象。这样的新曲艺已经出现了不少，其中不乏优秀的作品。当然，也有一些在质量上还比较差，有待于提高，那也不足为怪，它们的方向是正确的，应该进一步地加以发展，大力给予支持、爱护和鼓励而不是轻视它们。广大群众欢迎及时地反映现实生活、歌唱他们自己的新生活的曲艺，如果缺少这样的节目，而只有旧节目，就必然会脱离群众。
    对新曲艺重视不够甚至采取轻蔑态度的人，大致有这样两种人：洋教条主义者以为曲艺算不得文艺，这是轻视群众文艺的贵族老爷态度。另一种是土教条主义者，他们厚古薄今，满脑子保守思想，以为新曲艺总是赶不上旧曲艺，这是文艺上的古董家。他们实际上都是为艺术而艺术论者。当然，我们也要反对粗制滥造的作风，这种作风会影响新曲艺在观众中的声誉。这样的创作者表面上好像重视曲艺创作而实质上仍是轻视它。我们既要大量发展新曲艺创作，又要逐步提高创作的质量。
    一方面需要充分发挥曲艺的特长，使它迅速反映现实，为政治服务，大量创作以当前现实生活为题材的节目；另一方面，也需要积极整理和上演优秀的传统节目，承继和发展优秀的表演技巧。不少传统曲目只要剔除其中糟粕，仍可满足听众的健康的文化生活要求，历史传说中的英雄人物至今仍是人们所讴歌和学习的对象。这样的作品无疑是我们宝贵的文化遗产。至于优秀的传统艺术技巧，也应该加以学习和承继的，它对于发展新曲艺来说，是不可缺少的条件。但是，也有一些传统的艺术形式和技巧，或则原来就是糟粕，或则已经失去生命力，那就需要大胆地加以改革和突破。墨守成规并不能够使传统艺术保持生命，相反地，只有使它枯萎和死亡。
    任务的完成还需要依靠群众力量。必须在工厂、合作社、部队和学校中，大量发展业余的曲艺工作者，使曲艺的队伍进一步地扩大。全国曲艺艺人现在约有五万名，要普及和深入地展开工作，这样的数目自然是不够，这就需要重视业余力量，使专业和业余相结合，使队伍扩大到五十万、五百万名。工农兵业余曲艺创作者和演唱者，由于他们生活和战斗在自己的工作岗位上，熟悉群众生活，并有亲身的体会和深刻的感受，无论在写作和表演方面，都会有专业工作者所不容易具有的优点。业余曲艺工作者固然应该向专业工作者学习，以便提高自己的艺术水平；专业工作者也必须虚心学习和吸取业余工作者的经验和特长。只有专业和业余结合，在业余的基础上发展专业，使专业工作者拥有大量的业余工作者的后备军，曲艺工作才能得到更大的繁荣。
    此外，要使曲艺工作进一步的发展，还必须吸收一批新文艺工作者加入这支队伍。几年来，许多新文艺工作者加入了戏曲队伍，使戏曲有了很大的发展。同样，为了更好地进行提高和革新，更有成效地整理和承继传统节目和艺术技巧。曲艺工作也要求有更多的文学家、音乐家、表演艺术家去参加各个方面的工作，帮助专业艺人，向他们学习，进行研究、创作和改革工作。
    曲艺艺人自己必须提高政治水平和文化水平，结合思想改造革除落后习气。由于旧社会的原因，一部分艺人还没有摆脱文盲状态，扫盲工作是迫切需要进行的。
    我国业余的职业性的和半职业性的曲艺工作者，是一支群众性的文艺大军，他们联系着广大群众，他们的工作影响着工农兵学商的思想品质，影响着社会的道德风尚。因此各级党委、文化部门应该密切关心他们，重视他们，领导他们，充分发挥他们的力量。这是一支庞大的宣传队伍，能够为社会主义建设贡献出力量。我们相信，全体曲艺工作者在党的关怀和领导下，组织起来，加强团结，更加紧密地和劳动人民相结合，更大地发挥创造性积极性，一定能够完成自己的任务，使社会主义新曲艺开放出万紫千红美不胜收的花朵来！
