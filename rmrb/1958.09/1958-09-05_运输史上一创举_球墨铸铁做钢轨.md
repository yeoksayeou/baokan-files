　　A Pioneering Achievement in Transportation History
　　Ductile Iron Used for Steel Rails

　　(Our dispatch) A significant pioneering achievement in transportation history - heavy-duty ductile iron rails have been successfully trial-produced in Beijing. This is a valuable contribution to the nation from the foundry workshop of the Tsinghua University Mechanical Manufacturing Integrated Factory, in implementing the policy of combining education with production.

　　Manufacturing rails with ductile iron can not only save a large amount of steel, but more importantly, the cost of this type of rail is low, the equipment is simple, and the manufacturing is fast. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for small and medium-sized factories and rural counties, and is of great significance for the widespread development of railway transportation.

　　The newly manufactured heavy-duty ductile iron rails were tested on a main line of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant from August 4th. On this railway mainline, a section of heavy-duty ductile iron rail, 10 meters long, divided into three segments, and weighing 32 kilograms per meter, was laid. The carrying capacity reached 100 tons, the maximum train speed was 35 kilometers per hour, and a train passed every four minutes. Up to today, the train has run on this rail more than 2,000 times, and the rail remains intact. This experiment proves that it is perfectly feasible to use ductile iron rails to replace steel rails in the railway transportation of general small and medium-sized factories, counties, and townships, because the load on the railways in these places is much lighter than the load on the mainline tested at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant.

　　The proposal to manufacture heavy-duty ductile iron rails was put forward at the general Party branch committee of the Mechanical Engineering Department of the school. The general Party branch assigned this task to the secretary of the heat treatment Party branch, with a veteran worker and several students conducting the trial production. During the trial production process, they overcame many difficulties, solved many problems that arose in the trial production process through collective discussion and humble learning. The trial production work received strong assistance from the staff and workers of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and other units.

　　Currently, the staff and workers of the foundry workshop of the Tsinghua University Mechanical Manufacturing Integrated Factory are continuing to further improve the quality of the rails, so that the rails can bear greater loads, have a longer lifespan, and better conform to the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical.

　　运输史上一创举
    球墨铸铁做钢轨
    本报讯　运输史上的一件重要创举——重型球墨铸铁铁轨已在北京试制成功。这是清华大学机械制造综合工厂铸工车间在执行教育与生产相结合方针中向国家的一项很有价值的献礼。
    用球墨铸铁制造铁轨不但可以大量节约钢材，重要的是这种铁轨的成本低，设备简单，制造快，因此特别适用于中小工厂和乡县，对普遍发展铁路运输有很大意义。
    新制成的重型球墨铸铁铁轨从8月4日起曾在石景山钢铁厂的一条主要干线上作了试验。在这条铁道干线上铺上了一根长十公尺、分成三段、每公尺重三十二公斤的重型球墨铸铁铁轨，载重量达到一百吨，列车速度最快每小时三十五公里，每四分钟通一次车，到今天为止，火车在这种铁轨上面已运行两千多次，铁轨安然无恙。这种试验证明：在一般中小工厂、县乡的铁道运输中用球墨铸铁铁轨代替钢轨是完全没有问题的，因为在这些地方的铁道的负荷，要比在石景山钢铁厂试验的这条干线上的负荷轻得多。
    制造重型球墨铸铁铁轨的倡议是在这个学校机械系党总支委员会上提出来的。党总支把这个任务交给了热加工党支部书记负责，由一位老师傅和几位学生进行试制。在试制过程中，他们克服了重重困难，经过集体讨论，虚心学习，终于解决了试制过程中所发生的许多问题。试制工作曾得到长辛店机车车辆修理工厂、石景山钢铁厂等单位职工的大力协助。
    现在，清华大学机械制造综合工厂铸造车间的职工，正在进一步继续提高铁轨质量，使铁轨的负荷更大，寿命更长，更符合多快好省的原则。
