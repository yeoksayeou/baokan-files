Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th dispatch: The more than 1,300 people's communes in Henan Province, which have already realized people's communization, have shown incomparable superiority. According to preliminary statistics from seven special districts, the establishment of public canteens alone has freed more than 6.94 million women laborers from household chores and enabled them to participate in field labor. Due to military organization, combat-style production, and collective living, the production efficiency of people's communes is generally 20% higher than that of agricultural cooperatives. The "large" and "public" nature of people's communes makes it easier to expand public accumulation and rationally use funds. Most people's communes in Xuchang Special District will be able to prepare sufficient funds for the realization of agricultural mechanization within this year. The establishment of people's communes breaks the limitations of past agricultural cooperative production and enables better planting according to local conditions. After the merger of Fanwan and Liuji districts in Xinye County to establish a people's commune, simply by dividing the planting areas for corn and rice, the annual grain production can be increased by 110,000 jin. Each people's commune has established various specialized teams according to the needs of industrial and agricultural production. Xinyang, Xuchang, Xinxiang and other special districts have achieved "seven no's" in the fields within a few days, including no weeds, no third-class seedlings, and no pests and diseases. According to recent statistics, industrial enterprises run by people's communes across the province have reached more than 350,000. Xuchang Special District originally had only 30,000 factories. In the process of building people's communes, the number suddenly increased twofold in less than 20 days, reaching more than 90,000.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 9th dispatch: From late August to early September, 66 out of 74 counties and cities (suburbs) in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have basically realized people's communization. All agricultural cooperatives in these counties and cities have been merged after deliberation, and have been initially transformed into 828 people's communes, with an average of 2,000 to 5,000 households per commune.

In the process of establishing people's communes, all localities universally emphasized putting politics in command and ideological mobilization, and carried out mass airing of views and debates on the nature, superiority, and various policies of the communes. After airing of views and debates, the broad masses became clearer in their hearts, and thus, as soon as the people's communes were established, good news poured in from all production fronts. From August 20th, when large-scale commune building began, to September 1st, the progress of weeding and topdressing in the entire autonomous region increased sharply from 770,000 mu per day to 1.43 million mu, and the number of manufactured ball bearings increased from 1.5 million sets to 2.6 million sets, with 27 counties realizing ball bearingization of transportation tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 9th dispatch: The high tide of establishing people's communes is unfolding magnificently in Hunan Province. As of today, more than 40 people's communes have been built throughout the province.

The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires all counties to convene larger-scale expanded cadre meetings around September 10th to unify thinking, clarify the policies and practices of running people's communes, and then fully unfold the work throughout the province, basically realizing people's communization by the end of September and the beginning of October.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th dispatch: Due to the close integration with production, the rural people's commune movement in Shaanxi Province has developed rapidly and well, and it is expected that people's communization will be fully realized before the end of September this year.

At present, among the 101 counties and cities in the province, more than 40 counties and cities have realized communization and have set off a large-scale production upsurge.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 9th dispatch: The 268 people's communes piloted in various parts of Jiangsu have all been completed by the end of August. At present, most areas have the conditions for large-scale establishment of people's communes, and most areas in the province will basically realize people's communization in the near future in order to effectively promote the current production and the large-scale production movement after the autumn harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 9th dispatch: The pilot stage of establishing people's communes in rural areas of Jilin Province has ended, and it has now entered the stage of phased development.

Based on summarizing the pilot experience, the first batch of people's communes to be developed on a large scale accounts for about one-half of the existing agricultural cooperatives.

　　人民公社威力无比
    河南公社化后工农业生产飞跃发展
　　广西湖南陕西江苏吉林等省区建社运动全面铺开
　　据新华社郑州9日电　已经实现人民公社化的河南省，一千三百多个人民公社显示出了无比的优越性。据七个专区的初步统计，仅举办公共食堂一项，就使六百九十四万多个妇女劳动力从家务中解脱出来，参加了田间劳动。由于组织军事化、生产战斗化、生活集体化，人民公社的生产效率一般比农业社提高20％。人民公社的“大”和“公”，更便于扩大公共积累，合理使用资金。许昌专区的大多数人民公社，在今年内就可以为实现农业机械化准备好充足的基金。人民公社的建立，打破了过去农业社生产的局限性，能更好地因地种植。新野县范湾和刘集两个区合并建立人民公社后，单是玉米和水稻两种作物分区种植，一年就可以增产十一万斤粮食。每个人民公社都根据工农业生产的需要建立起各种专业队。信阳、许昌、新乡等专区在几天之内就实现田间无杂草、无三类苗、无病虫等“七无”。据最近统计，全省人民公社办的工业企业已达三十五万多个。许昌专区原来只有三万个工厂，在建人民公社过程中，不到二十天时间就猛然增加两倍，达到九万多个。
    据新华社南宁9日电　广西僮族自治区从8月下旬到9月初，在七十四个县市中已有六十六个县市（郊区）基本实现人民公社化。这些县市的全部农业社经过酝酿合并，初步转成了八百二十八个人民公社，平均每个公社有两千到五千户。
    建立人民公社过程中，各地普遍强调政治挂帅和思想发动，对公社的性质、优越性和各项政策，都开展了群众性的鸣放辩论。经过鸣放辩论，广大群众心里愈辩愈亮，因而人民公社一建立，各条生产战线上就捷报频传。从8月20日大办公社到9月1日，全自治区耘田追肥进度每日由七十七万亩激增到一百四十三万亩，制成的滚珠轴承由一百五十万套增加到二百六十万套，有二十七个县实现了运转工具滚珠轴承化。
    据新华社长沙9日电　办人民公社的高潮，正波澜壮阔地在湖南省展开。到今天为止，全省已建成四十多个人民公社。
    中共湖南省委要求各县在9月10日左右召开规模较大的扩大干部会，以统一思想，明确办人民公社的政策与作法，接着全省全面铺开，9月底10月初基本实现人民公社化。
    据新华社西安9日电　由于紧密结合生产，陕西省农村人民公社运动发展得又快又好，预计在今年9月底前即可全部实现人民公社化。
    现在，在全省的一百零一个县市中，已经有四十多个县市实现了公社化，并已掀起一个规模宏大的生产高潮。
    据新华社南京9日电　江苏各地试办的二百六十八个人民公社，到8月底已全部建成。目前多数地区大办人民公社的条件已经具备，全省多数地区将在最近一个时期基本实现人民公社化，以便有力地推动当前生产和秋后的大生产运动。
    据新华社长春9日电　吉林省农村建立人民公社的试点阶段已经结束，目前已进入分批发展阶段。
    在总结试点经验的基础上，各地开始大发展的第一批人民公社约占现有全部农业社的二分之一。
