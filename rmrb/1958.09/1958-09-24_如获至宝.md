    As if Acquiring a Treasure

    In the upsurge of vigorously developing the steel industry, the masses in our district have enthusiastically built small earthen furnaces and earthen pots for iron smelting. However, due to lack of experience, they initially couldn't separate slag from iron. For example, Bai Liu Township successively smelted five furnaces, and Jin Du Township successively smelted three pots, but none produced iron. Everyone visited and inquired everywhere, but couldn't find a solution for a while, and were so anxious they scratched their heads. Just at this critical moment, the People's Daily published the article "What to Do When Slag Comes Out But Not Iron?" on August 23rd, which everyone regarded as if acquiring a treasure. These two townships, comparing notes with this article, held an on-site meeting in front of the furnace, found the reason for the failure to separate slag from iron, and immediately made improvements. When people saw the red-hot molten iron gushing out of the furnace, they cheered incessantly. Some people excitedly picked up this People's Daily and jumped up, saying, "The People's Daily has helped us greatly!"

    Currently, rural industries and mines are springing up like mushrooms after a rain. We urgently hope that the People's Daily and local newspapers and periodicals will, according to the needs of the masses, appropriately publish some articles introducing industrial technology.

    如获至宝
    在大办钢铁工业高潮中，我区群众自建小土炉和土罐炼铁风起云涌。但因没有经验，开始都渣铁不分。如白柳乡连炼五炉，金渡乡连炼三罐，均未出铁。大家东访西问，一时总找不到解决办法，急得直抓头。正在紧张关头，刚巧8月23日人民日报发表了“出渣不出铁怎么办？”这篇文章，大家如获至宝。这两个乡对照这篇文章，在炉前开了现场会议，找到了渣铁不分的原因，立即作了改进。当人们看到赤红的铁水奔流出炉时，都欢呼不已。有的人兴奋得拿着这张人民日报跳起来，说：“人民日报帮了我们的大忙！”
    当前，农村的工矿业正如雨后春笋，到处开花。我们迫切希望人民日报和各地报刊根据群众的需要，适当登载些介绍工业技术的文章。
