　　Major Measures to Defend National Sovereignty
Liu Zerong
    The breadth of the territorial sea of the People's Republic of China shall be twelve nautical miles. This provision applies to all territories of the People's Republic of China, including the Chinese mainland and its coastal islands, as well as Taiwan and its surrounding islands, the Penghu Islands, the Dongsha Islands, the Xisha Islands, the Zhongsha Islands, the Nansha Islands, and other islands belonging to China that are separated from the mainland and its coastal islands by the high seas.
                    —Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Territorial Sea

    The "Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Territorial Sea" published on the 4th of this month is a very important and timely measure to defend our national sovereignty.

    The territorial sea is a sea area belonging to national sovereignty. The sovereignty of a coastal state extends to its territorial sea, the airspace above the territorial sea, and the seabed and subsoil of the territorial sea. This is a principle recognized in international law, and even the imperialist countries dare not oppose it. The reason why the imperialist countries stubbornly oppose the demands of the majority of countries on the issue of territorial seas is mainly about the width of the territorial sea. The imperialist countries, such as the United States and Britain, which call themselves "maritime powers," have always adhered in theory to the so-called "traditional" and "only legal" three-nautical-mile width of the territorial sea, and strived to limit the scope of other countries' territorial seas. In reality, their purpose is nothing more than to freely carry out economic aggression (fishing, etc.) and even military activities in the sea areas close to the coasts of other countries. The "traditional" three-nautical-mile width they speak of was originally stipulated by the United States in its domestic law in 1793 (a nautical mile is equal to 1.852 kilometers or 3.704 Chinese miles). Later, many countries also adopted this width; this was originally based on the range of cannons at the time, as if to indicate that the sea surface that a country could control with its onshore weapons was its territorial sea. However, with the continuous development of weapon technology, the range of cannons has long exceeded three nautical miles, so this width has long lost its original basis. At the same time, many countries feel it necessary to expand the scope of their territorial seas in order to protect their national defense, economic rights, and interests. Some countries have already adopted larger widths, but countries such as Britain and the United States have tried their best to oppose this and refuse to recognize it. Since the end of the nineteenth century, suggestions have been made internationally to adjust this issue in order to determine a uniform territorial sea width for all countries. The International Law Conference held in The Hague in 1930 discussed the issue of territorial sea width, but the conference did not achieve results due to the insistence of countries such as Britain and the United States on their three-nautical-mile position. This issue has not been resolved uniformly until now, although there are various different territorial sea widths in international practice.

    According to the materials of the Secretariat of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea convened in Geneva this spring, 68 countries reported their current territorial sea widths: 21 countries (Britain and its dominions, the United States, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan) have three nautical miles; 3 countries (Sweden, Norway, Finland) have four nautical miles; 1 country (Cambodia) has five nautical miles; 12 countries (Italy, Spain, Portugal, India, Iran, Greece, Yugoslavia, Thailand, etc.) have six nautical miles; 1 country (Mexico) has nine nautical miles; 1 country (Albania) has ten nautical miles; 12 countries (the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, the United Arab Republic, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Venezuela, Libya; Iceland recently announced a width of twelve nautical miles) have twelve nautical miles; 1 country (Chile) has fifty kilometers; 1 country (El Salvador) has two hundred nautical miles. In addition, 5 countries (Iraq, Ireland, West Germany, Costa Rica, Monaco) reported that their territorial sea width "is stipulated in accordance with international law." There are also 8 countries (Lebanon, Morocco, Yemen, the Philippines, Turkey, Panama, Peru, Nicaragua) that did not indicate their territorial sea width (of which Turkey is preparing to revise its original six-nautical-mile provision, and three American countries tend to extend their sovereignty to the entire continental shelf).

    Thus, among the 60-plus countries, only 21 countries (including the British dominions) have a territorial sea width of three nautical miles, and the rest are larger than three nautical miles.

    Recently, the issue of territorial sea width has become the object of fierce struggle internationally. The United Nations International Law Commission discussed this issue many times. At its eighth session (1956), the commission, in its proposed "Draft Articles on the Law of the Sea," failed to specifically determine the territorial sea width due to the constant insistence of countries such as Britain and the United States, but stated that the commission "recognizes that international practice regarding the delimitation of the territorial sea is not uniform" and "believes that international law does not permit the territorial sea width to exceed twelve nautical miles." In other words, the commission believes that a territorial sea width not exceeding twelve nautical miles is legal. The United Nations General Assembly submitted the commission's "Draft Articles" to the Conference on the Law of the Sea convened in Geneva this spring for discussion. (China, North Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, and East Germany were not invited to participate.) At this conference, a fierce debate unfolded on the issue of territorial sea width. The United States and Britain initially insisted on three nautical miles, but later, seeing that the majority of countries did not accept it, they had to make "concessions" and proposed the following plan: the territorial sea width shall not exceed six nautical miles, and countries shall have the right to determine a fishing zone of no more than twelve nautical miles from the territorial sea baseline, but countries that originally fished there shall have the right to continue fishing within a certain range of this fishing zone. This plan also failed to pass.

    The Soviet Union proposed a plan: each country has the right to determine the width of its territorial sea, taking into account relevant historical and geographical circumstances, economic interests, security interests, and the interests of international navigation, in principle within the range of three to twelve nautical miles according to general existing practice. This plan was supported by many countries. Secondly, it is worth noting the joint proposal of eight countries, namely the United Arab Republic, Burma, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Morocco, Colombia, and Venezuela: each country has the right to determine its own territorial sea width within the range of twelve nautical miles, and countries with a territorial sea width of less than twelve nautical miles may expand their exclusive fishing zone to twelve nautical miles. This proposal received the most affirmative votes (39 countries), but it also failed to pass because it did not reach the two-thirds vote required for the General Assembly to make a decision. Because no proposal could be passed, the Conference on the Law of the Sea still failed to make a resolution on the issue of territorial sea width, and the convention on the territorial sea that it passed did not mention the issue of territorial sea width at all. The conference decided to ask the General Assembly to decide whether to convene another Conference on the Law of the Sea to resolve the issues that could not be resolved this time. Thus, the issue of territorial sea width has not yet reached a specific international agreement due to the obstruction of the imperialist countries. However, this does not mean that the unfounded fallacies insisted on by the imperialist countries, such as the three-nautical-mile width being "traditional," "the only legal one," and "no country may unilaterally expand it," still have room for existence. On the contrary, this fallacy has long been denied by many countries and suffered an unprecedented and devastating blow at this Conference on the Law of the Sea. The position of 39 countries fully proves this, and even the United States itself has proposed a width of six nautical miles (Britain has expressed its agreement). The opinions of the aforementioned International Law Commission, international practice, and the course of this Conference on the Law of the Sea all fully prove that: 1. the determination of the territorial sea width belongs to the country's own sovereignty; 2. a territorial sea width of twelve nautical miles is completely legal. Therefore, it is completely legal for our country to determine a territorial sea width of twelve nautical miles for all our territories based on the actual needs of national defense and economy, and no other country has the right to oppose it.

    Since the territorial sea has a certain width, the question of from what point on the coast this width should be measured must still be decided. Because the territorial sea is a long sea area, it is natural to delineate a line in order to measure the territorial sea width outward from this line and take the sea area with this width as the territorial sea. This line is called the territorial sea baseline. The most common method internationally for determining the territorial sea baseline is to use the low-water line of the coast as the territorial sea baseline, that is, the line to which the seawater recedes farthest from the shore at low tide is used as the territorial sea baseline. Such a baseline, namely the low-water baseline, is called the normal baseline.

    However, some coasts are very curved, forming many bays, and there are many islands along the coast. It is not easy to find the low-water line on such coasts. Therefore, another method of determining the territorial sea baseline can be adopted, that is, selecting a series of locations on the shore and on the coastal islands as base points and connecting each base point to its left and right base points with a straight line, forming a series of straight lines. This series of connected straight lines forms a broken-line-shaped territorial sea baseline. Because such a baseline is composed of a series of straight lines, this method is called the straight baseline method.

    Our country's adoption of the straight baseline method to determine the territorial sea baseline is suitable for the geographical conditions of many places on our coast and is completely legal. Among other countries, the most representative example of the use of the straight baseline method is the territorial sea baseline of Norway and Iceland, and Indonesia has recently announced that it will also adopt this method. Britain once opposed Norway's adoption of this method, but the International Court of Justice heard the Anglo-Norwegian fisheries dispute case and finally pointed out in its 1951 judgment that this straight baseline method did not conflict with international law. The United Nations International Law Commission also recognized this method in the aforementioned "Draft Articles on the Law of the Sea"; the convention on the territorial sea passed by this Conference on the Law of the Sea also recognized the straight baseline method.

    In our country's statement this time, it is pointed out that the sea area outside the territorial sea baseline is the territorial sea, the sea area inside the baseline is the internal sea, and the islands within the baseline are internal sea islands. This is very natural (the aforementioned convention on the territorial sea also states that the sea area within the territorial sea baseline is the internal sea). Since the sea area within the baseline is the internal sea, all our country's bays and straits drawn within the baseline, including the Bohai Bay and the Qiongzhou Strait, are naturally our internal seas.

    The legal status of the internal sea is completely the same as that of land; the most significant difference between it and the territorial sea is that there is no right of innocent passage for foreign ships there.

    Since national sovereignty extends to the territorial sea and the airspace above the territorial sea, the coastal state has the right, for the sake of its security, to require that all foreign aircraft and warships must obtain the prior permission of the coastal state government before entering the territorial sea. This is a very natural principle. However, in order to maintain the convenience of free activities in the near seas of other countries, the imperialist countries such as Britain and the United States believe that warships, like other ships, can have innocent passage in the territorial seas of all countries. Not only socialist countries, but even many countries among capitalist countries oppose such a view. The "Draft Articles on the Law of the Sea" prepared by the United Nations International Committee acknowledged that "the coastal state may stipulate that the passage of warships through the territorial sea shall be subject to prior approval or notification," but the General Assembly of this Conference on the Law of the Sea deleted this article. However, in any case, all foreign ships (including warships) should abide by the relevant laws and regulations of the coastal state when passing through the territorial sea, which is an internationally recognized principle (the convention passed by the Conference on the Law of the Sea also has such provisions). Therefore, if the coastal state stipulates that foreign warships must obtain prior permission, then such ships shall not enter the territorial sea without permission, and even if they have obtained permission to enter, they should also abide by the relevant laws and regulations of the coastal state on the territorial sea. The provisions of our country's statement on this issue are very necessary and completely legal.

    The above fully proves that the "Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Territorial Sea" is an exercise of China's sovereignty and conforms to the interests and demands of the Chinese people. This statement also fully conforms to international law and international actual conditions and has been supported by many countries and their public opinion. The various principles of the statement on the territorial sea, as announced, apply to all territories of the People's Republic of China, naturally including coastal islands as well as Taiwan, Penghu, and other islands belonging to China that are separated from the mainland by the high seas. This shows the Chinese people's unwavering determination to defend their sovereignty and interests over the territorial sea. The 600 million Chinese people will wage a resolute struggle against the acts of aggression and war provocation by US imperialism in order to defend the territorial integrity and sacred sovereignty of the motherland.

　　保卫国家主权的重大措施刘泽荣
    中华人民共和国的领海宽度为十二海里（浬）。这项规定适用于中华人民共和国的一切领土，包括中国大陆及其沿海岛屿，和同大陆及其沿海岛屿隔有公海的台湾及其周围各岛、澎湖列岛、东沙群岛、西沙群岛、中沙群岛、南沙群岛以及其他属于中国的岛屿。
                    —中华人民共和国政府关于领海的声明
    本月4日发表的“中华人民共和国政府关于领海的声明”是对于保卫我国主权非常重要的、及时的措施。
    领海是属于国家主权的海域。沿岸国的主权及于领海，领海的上空以及领海的海底和海底之下的地层，这是国际法上公认的原则，帝国主义国家也不敢反对的。帝国主义国家在领海问题上固执地反对多数国家的要求，主要是关于领海的宽度问题。号称“海洋强国”的美英等帝国主义国家一向在理论上坚持所谓“传统的”、“唯一合法的”三浬领海宽度之说，力求对别国领海范围加以限制，而其实际的目的，不过是要在靠近别国沿岸一带的海域自由进行经济上的侵略（捕鱼等）甚至军事上的活动。它们所谓“传统的”三浬领海宽度最初是美国于1793年在国内法上规定的（浬是海里，等于一点八五二公里或三点七零四华里）以后有许多国家也采定了这样的宽度；这原来是根据当时大炮射程而定的，仿佛表示国家用岸上的武器所能控制到的海面，就是它的领海。但是武器技术不断的发展，炮的射程早已远远地超过三浬，因此这样的宽度早已失去原来的根据。同时，许多国家感到为了保卫国防上、经济上的权利和利益，有必要扩大领海范围，早已有一些国家采定较大的宽度，而英美等国竭力反对，不肯承认。自十九世纪末叶起，在国际间开始提出调整这问题的建议，以求定出各国划一的领海宽度，1930年在海牙召开的国际法会议讨论了领海宽度问题，但是由于英美等国坚持它们三浬的主张，会议未获结果。直到现在这问题没有统一解决，虽然在国际实践上已有各种不同的领海宽度。
    根据今年春天联合国在日内瓦召集的海洋法会议秘书处的材料，六十八个国家报告它们现在的领海宽度：三浬的，二十一国（英国和各自治领、美、法、比、荷、日）；四浬的，三国（瑞典、挪威、芬兰）；五浬的，一国（柬埔寨）；六浬的，十二国（意、西班牙、葡、印、伊朗、希腊、南斯拉夫、泰等）；九浬的，一国（墨西哥）；十浬的，一国（阿尔巴尼亚）；十二浬的十二国（苏、保、罗、阿联、印度尼西亚、沙特阿拉伯、厄瓜多尔、埃塞俄比亚、危地马拉、委内瑞拉、利比亚；冰岛最近宣布十二浬宽度）；五十公里的，一国（智利）；二百浬的，一国（萨尔瓦多）。此外有五国（伊拉克、爱尔兰、西德、哥斯达黎加、摩纳哥）的领海宽度，报告说“是按照国际法规定的。”还有八国（黎巴嫩、摩洛哥、也门、菲律宾、土耳其、巴拿马、秘鲁、厄加拉瓜）没有指出领海宽度（其中土耳其准备把原有六浬的规定加以修改，而三个美洲国家有将主权推广到全部大陆架的趋向）。
    这样看起来，六十多国之中只有二十一国（包括英国各自治领）的领海宽度是三浬的，其余都是比三浬较大的宽度。
    近来领海宽度问题在国际间成为激烈斗争的对象。联合国国际法委员会对这问题讨论多次，该委员会第八届会议（1956年）在它拟定的“关于海法条款”内，由于英美等国始终坚持它们的主张，未能具体地确定领海宽度，但表示委员会“承认关于划定领海界限的国际实践并不是一致的”，并“认为国际法不允许领海宽度超过十二浬”，换言之，委员会认为不超过十二浬的领海宽度是合法的。联大把这委员会的“条款”提交今年春天在日内瓦召集的海洋法会议讨论。（我国、朝鲜、越南、蒙古、民主德国没有被邀请参加）在这个会议上，关于领海宽度问题展开了激烈的争论。美英最初仍坚持三浬，但后来看见大多数国家不接受，因此不得不作出“让步”，而提出如下方案：领海宽度不得超过六浬，国家并有权定出从领海基线算起的不超过十二浬的渔业区，但原来在该处捕鱼的国家有权在这渔区的一定范围内继续捕鱼。这个方案也未能通过。
    苏联提的方案是：每一国家有权顾及有关历史和地理情况、经济利益、安全上的利益以及国际航海的利益，而自行确定其领海的宽度，照一般已有的惯例，原则上在三至十二浬范围内。这个方案得到许多国家的拥护。其次可以注意到阿联、缅甸、印度尼西亚、沙特阿拉伯、墨西哥、摩洛哥、哥伦比亚、委内瑞拉八国共同提案即：各国有权在十二浬范围内确定自己的领海宽度，领海宽度少于十二浬者，得扩大其专属渔业区到十二浬。这个提案得到最多的赞成票（三十九国），只因为还没有达到大会表决需要的三分之二的票，也未能通过。因为没有一个提案能够通过，所以此次海洋法会议仍然未能对领海宽度问题作出决议，而其所通过的关于领海问题的公约完全没有提到领海宽度问题。会议决议请联大决定应否再开一次海洋法会议，来解决此次未能解决的问题。这样，领海宽度问题，由于帝国主义国家的阻挠，迄今仍未能达成具体的国际协议。然而这并不是说，帝国主义国家所坚持的三浬宽度是“传统的”、“唯一合法的”、“任何国家不得片面扩大的”，等等毫无根据的谬论仍然有存在的余地。相反的，此种谬论早已被许多国家否认，而在此次海洋法会议上受到空前的毁灭性的打击。三十九国的主张充分证明了这一点，而且甚至美国自己也提出过六浬的宽度（英国表示同意）。上述国际法委员会的意见、国际的实践和此次海洋法会议的经过，这一切充分证明：一、对领海宽度的确定是属于国家自己的主权；二、十二浬的领海宽度是完全合法的。因此，我国此次基于国防上、经济上的实际需要对我国一切领土定出十二浬的领海宽度是完全合法的，别国无权加以反对。
    领海既然有一定的宽度，这宽度究竟应当从海岸上什么地点起测定出来，这还是必须决定的问题。因为领海是一片长形的海域，自然要划定一条线，才能从这条线向外测定出领海宽度，把有这宽度的一片海域作为领海，这一条线叫做领海基线。国际上划定领海基线最普遍的方法是以海岸的低潮线作为领海基线，就是以海水退潮时，退到离岸最远的那一条线作为领海基线，这样的基线，即低潮基线，叫做正常基线。
    不过有的海岸，非常弯曲，形成许多湾子，沿岸又有许多岛屿，在这样的海岸不容易找出低潮线，因此可以采取另一种划定领海基线的方法，即岸上和在沿岸的岛屿上选定一系列地点作为基点，把每一个基点同它左右两个基点用直线连接起来，形成一系列直线，这一系列直线相连着就组成一条折线形的领海基线。因为这样的基线是由一系列直线组成的，所以这个方法叫做直基线方法。
    我国采取直基线方法来划定领海基线，是适合于我国海岸许多地方的地理条件，而且是完全合法的。在别的国家之中，最有代表性的直基线方法采用的例子是挪威和冰岛的领海基线，近来印度尼西亚也宣布要采取这个办法。英国曾经反对过挪威采取这个办法，但国际法院审理英挪渔业争执案，终于1951年在判决书里指出这个直基线方法与国际法并不抵触。联合国国际法委员会在上述“关于海法条款”里也承认这个方法；此次海洋法会议通过的关于领海的公约也承认了直基线的方法。
    在我国此次声明中指出领海基线以外的海域是领海，基线内的海域是内海，在基线内的岛屿是内海岛屿，这是很自然的（上述关于领海的公约也说明领海基线以内的海域是内海）。基线以内的海域既然是内海，划在基线内的我国一切海湾、海峡，包括渤海湾和琼州海峡，自然也是我国内海。
    内海的法律地位完全同陆地一样；它和领海的不同最显著的是它那里不存在外国船舶的无害通过权。
    国家的主权既然及于领海和领海的上空，沿岸国为它的安全起见有权要求外国一切飞机和军用船舶必须事前取得沿岸国政府的许可才能进入领海范围。这是很自然的道理。但是英美等帝国主义国家为了保持在别国近海上自由活动的便利，认为军舰同别的船舶一样可以在各国领海上无害通过。这不但为社会主义国家，而且连资本主义国家中也有许多国家反对这样的看法。联合国国际委员会所拟的“关于海法的条款”承认“沿岸国得规定军舰通过领海须先经核准或通知”，今年海洋法会议大会却把这一条删除。但是无论如何，一切外国船舶（包括军舰在内）通过领海时都应遵守沿岸国有关的法令和规则，是国际上公认的原则（海洋法会议通过的公约也有这样的规定）。因此，如果沿岸国规定，外国军用船舶必须事前取得许可，则该项船舶未经许可就不得进入领海，而且即令是取得许可进来的，亦应在领海上遵守沿岸国有关法令和规则。我国此次声明关于这问题的规定是非常需要的和完全合法的。
    以上所述，充分证明了“中华人民共和国政府关于领海的声明”，是行使中国的主权，符合中国人民的利益和要求的。这一声明也完全符合国际法和国际实际情况，已经受到许多国家和它们的舆论的支持。关于领海的声明各项原则，如所宣布，适用于中华人民共和国的一切领土，自然包括沿海岛屿以及同大陆隔有公海的台湾、澎湖和其他属于中国的岛屿在内。这表示中国人民保卫自己对领海的主权和利益的不可动摇的决心。中国六亿人民将为保卫祖国的领土完整和神圣主权而对美帝国主义的侵略行为和战争挑衅进行坚决的斗争。
