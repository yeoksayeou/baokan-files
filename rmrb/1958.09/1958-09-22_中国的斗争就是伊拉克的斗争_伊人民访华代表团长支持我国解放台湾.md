Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th—Abdul Wahab Mahmoud, head of the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China, told Xinhua News Agency reporters today that American troops must withdraw from Taiwan and the Middle East.

This fifteen-member delegation is the first delegation to visit China since the Iraqi revolution. It arrived here today en route to China to attend the National Day celebrations in Beijing on October 1st.

Mahmoud, who is the president of the Iraqi Bar Association, emphasized in a separate interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters that "Taiwan is Chinese territory and must be returned to China. China has full rights in Taiwan and the coastal islands."

He said that the presence of American troops in the Taiwan Strait area is a threat to world peace. He also said: "The American troops in that region must withdraw sooner or later."

He expressed the Iraqi people's support for the Chinese people's struggle against American imperialism. He said: "China's struggle against imperialism in the Far East is our struggle. Therefore, the victory of the Chinese people against imperialism is also our victory."

Regarding the current situation in the Middle East, Mahmoud pointed out that the American and British troops should withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan as soon as possible, because "they are threatening the peace of the Middle East and the world."

He said that the Iraqi people are doing everything possible to ensure the implementation of the United Nations resolution on the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Middle East.

Mahmoud expressed the Iraqi people's gratitude to the Chinese people. He said that for Iraq, the first day of their revolution was a serious moment, "and in those serious moments, the Chinese people and government supported us. We believe that our success is due to the support of friends like the Chinese people, as well as socialist countries and all peace-loving people in the world."

He said that the best way to maintain world peace is for the people of the world to unite and defeat any attempt by American warmongers to launch a war.

He said that the aspiration of the Iraqi people "is to live in peace and establish good relations with other countries in the world."

He said that the purpose of their visit to China is to see China's great achievements in industry, irrigation projects, and cultural construction.

    伊人民访华代表团长支持我国解放台湾
    新华社香港20日电　伊拉克人民友好访华团团长阿卜杜勒·瓦哈卜·马哈茂德今天对新华社记者说，美国军队必须从台湾和中东撤退。
    这个由十五人组成的代表团是自从伊拉克革命以来第一个访问中国的代表团，它今天到达这里前往中国参加十月一日在北京举行的中国国庆节观礼。
    马哈茂德是伊拉克律师协会主席，他在单独接见新华社记者时强调说：“台湾是中国的领土，必须交还给中国，中国在台湾和沿海岛屿拥有充分权利。”
    他说，美国军队驻在台湾海峡地区是对世界和平的一个威胁。他又说：“在那个地区的美国军队迟早必须撤退。”
    他表示伊拉克人民支持中国人民对美帝国主义者进行的斗争。他说：“中国在远东对帝国主义者进行的斗争就是我们的斗争，因此，中国人民反对帝国主义所获得的胜利也就是我们的胜利。”
    关于目前中东局势问题，马哈茂德指出，美英军队应该尽早从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退，因为“他们在威胁中东和世界和平。”
    他说，伊拉克人民正在尽一切可能使联合国关于从中东撤退外国军队的决议得到执行。
    马哈茂德表示了伊拉克人民对中国人民的谢意。他说，对伊拉克来说，他们革命的头一天是一个严重的时刻，“而在那些严重的时刻中，中国人民和政府支持我们，我们认为，我们的成功多亏像中国人民以及社会主义国家和全世界一切爱好和平的人民这样一些朋友的支援。”
    他说，维护世界和平最好的办法就是，全世界人民团结起来，打败美国战争贩子发动战争的任何企图。
    他说，伊拉克人民的愿望“就是过和平生活，并且同世界上其他国家建立良好关系。”
    他说，他们访问中国的目的是想看一看中国在工业、灌溉计划和文化建设等方面的伟大成就。
