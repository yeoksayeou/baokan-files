Xinhua News Agency, September 5th, Moscow Dispatch from TASS, Moscow, September 5th: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" today issued a stern warning to American imperialism: Those who incite and plot new military adventures in the Far East should not imagine that the repercussions will be limited to the coastal islands and the Taiwan Strait. They will suffer such a devastating blow, a blow that will surely end America's imperialist aggression in the Far East. This commentary, titled "Military Adventures of American Imperialists in the Far East" (full text on page four), strongly condemns the provocative actions of the American government against the Chinese people. The article points out that the Soviet people cannot remain indifferent to American military preparations in the Pacific and will use all means to aid their fraternal Chinese people.

The article notes that the recent events in the Taiwan Strait indicate that these offensives are merely part of a large-scale military provocation conspiracy launched by American imperialists against the People's Republic of China and the people of all Asian countries. Before the first cannons fired on the Chinese coast had even ceased, the American government dispatched its Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait. Senior American generals and diplomats also recently held lengthy talks with Chiang Kai-shek, agreeing on plans and reaching agreements on further actions.

The article points out that the new military adventures plotted by American imperialists in the Far East contain a direct and serious threat to world peace. The article warns these adventurers that the People's Republic of China has sufficient strength to give the aggressors the punishment they deserve. On the side of the Chinese people is not only the sympathy of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin American and Europe, but also the power of the entire socialist camp. The Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to what happens on the borders or territories of its great ally, and the Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to American military preparations in the Pacific, because the waters of the Pacific also lap at the shores of the Soviet Union. The Soviet people, who have fraternal friendship and mutual assistance relations with the People's Republic of China, will use all means to assist their brothers – the Chinese people – to restrain the shameless and reckless adventurers – the warmongers.

　　真理报对美国在中国沿海挑衅提出严厉警告
　　战争冒险者将遭到毁灭性回击
    苏联将用一切方法援助中国人民
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联“真理报”今天向美国帝国主义发出严厉警告：在远东煽动和策划新的军事冒险的人休想回击只会限于沿海岛屿地区和台湾海峡。他们将遭到这样毁灭性的打击，这种打击必将结束美国在远东的帝国主义侵略。这篇题为“美国帝国主义者在远东的军事冒险”的评论员的文章（全文见第四版），严厉谴责了美国政府对中国人民的挑衅行动。文章指出，苏联人民对美国在太平洋的军事备战活动不能漠然视之，并且将用一切方法来援助自己的兄弟中国人民。
    文章指出，最近几天台湾海峡地区所发生的事件表明，这些进攻只不过是美国帝国主义者对中华人民共和国以及对整个亚洲各国人民所发动的大规模军事挑衅阴谋的一部分。中国沿海第一批炮声还没有沉寂下来，美国政府就派遣了它的第七舰队到台湾海峡地区。美国高级将领及外交人员最近还同蒋介石举行了长时间的会谈，商定了一些计划，并就进一步的行动达成了协议。
    文章指出，美国帝国主义者在远东策划的新的军事冒险包含着对世界和平的直接的、严重的威胁。文章警告这些冒险之徒，中华人民共和国拥有足够的力量给侵略者以应有的打击。在中国人民这一边的不仅有亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和欧洲各国人民的同情，而且还有整个社会主义阵营的威力。苏联对于在它的伟大盟国的边境上或领土上所发生的事情，不能漠不关心，苏联对于美国在太平洋的备战活动不能漠然视之，因为太平洋的水也拍击着苏联的海岸。同中华人民共和国有着兄弟友谊和互相援助关系的苏联人民将用一切方法援助自己的兄弟——中国人民，来约束厚颜无耻的轻举妄动的冒险之徒——战争挑拨者。
