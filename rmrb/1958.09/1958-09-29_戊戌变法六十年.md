The Hundred Days' Reform is now a full sixty years in the past. Within this short time, China has experienced two stages: bourgeois democratic revolution and proletarian socialist revolution. The issues raised by the Reform, the classes, figures, and ideas involved, seem like a world away today. However, the Reform Movement, as an important link in the process of Chinese national awakening, has lasting significance.

Counting back sixty years from the Hundred Days' Reform, China was in the midst of the vigorous struggle against opium, on the eve of the Opium War with Britain. The Opium War, the Taiping Rebellion, the Anglo-French allied invasion, the Sino-French War, the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, and a series of other major events all occurred during this time. These events proved that at this time, only the peasants were the driving force of history, the initiators of the anti-feudal struggle, and the main force in the anti-aggression struggle. The Qing government, representing the great landlords, large bureaucrats, and Manchu nobles, feared the people and dared not resolutely resist foreign aggression, causing China to suffer defeat in every foreign war. Imperialism forced this government to sign a large number of unequal treaties to enslave the Chinese people, and the landlord ruling forces gradually combined with foreign powers, becoming tools of the aggressors. In the later period of these sixty years, on the one hand, imperialism from Britain, the United States, France, Russia, Germany, Japan, and other countries invaded, turning China into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, and on the other hand, capitalism, a new mode of production, appeared in China. Especially after the Sino-Japanese War, the renewed wave of land seizures put China in danger of being partitioned, while national industry was showing its vitality. Saving the nation from peril and developing capitalism became the two most fundamental and urgent issues facing society.

At this time, the first high tide of peasant struggle had passed, and the resurgence of peasant struggle and the revolutionary tide of the bourgeoisie were still to come. The Chinese working class was in its early stages at the time, a class in itself. Therefore, the responsibility of seeking answers to these two questions had to be temporarily undertaken by the immature force of the bourgeois reformists. The Chinese bourgeoisie's political movement began with the Hundred Days' Reform.

"Reform," was the answer given by the bourgeois reformers to these two questions. Reform was originally an old slogan, but when it was combined with the demands of the bourgeoisie and incorporated relatively complete capitalist content, it took on new meaning. Before this, many people advocated reform, demanding protection for industry and commerce, national independence, and certain democratic reforms by the Qing government. There was no clear boundary between these ideas and the proposals of the comprador-bureaucratic-oriented Westernization Movement. The reformers differed from this; they demanded the development of industry and commerce and advocated changing the feudal autocratic political system. In the words of Kang Youwei, it was necessary to address the situation where "the top is highly respected while the bottom's sentiments are not conveyed," and that "small changes are impossible, a complete change is necessary." In his "Overall Planning" memorial, Kang Youwei, on behalf of the reformers, announced a three-point program: overall planning to seek reform, a grand oath by the officials to determine national policy, and the establishment of a system bureau to determine the constitution. The first was a comprehensive reform of administrative institutions, the second was reliance on the emperor's power to promote the new policies, and the third was to change the autocratic political system and allow the reformers to participate in the government. This was clearly no other program; it was a bourgeois political program. The reformers stood at the forefront of the historical tide, playing the role of the first bourgeois political representatives in China.

The combination of mass activities and top-down reform activities was a characteristic of the Reform Movement. The "Public Vehicle Memorial" initiated by Kang Youwei in 1895, with more than 1,300 people jointly demanding "rejecting peace, moving the capital, and reforming," was the first sound of this movement. After the Public Vehicle Memorial, the influence of the reformers spread throughout the country. Societies and schools sprung up everywhere, newspapers and periodicals flourished, and discussions arose. The propaganda of reform and the study of new learning went beyond a small circle and became a mass movement. Ou Jujia described that at that time, the entire country's scholars and people "talked about current affairs in every household and discussed Western learning." Liang Qichao recorded that many prefectures and counties in Hunan Province established schools and societies, and many heroic and resolute, younger scholars participated in the activities. "Without academic degrees, without official rank, those whose names were not yet known were countless." However, the activities of the reformers were limited to using societies and newspapers to carry out propaganda and appeals, hoping to obtain the support of certain central officials and local governors-general in the Qing government to promote their political reform proposals. This clearly showed the reformist nature of the Reform Movement. The serious national crisis and the tide of the Reform Movement were bound to cause sharp reflections within the Qing government. The so-called struggle between the Emperor's faction and the Empress Dowager's faction was mainly not a dispute over palace trivia, but a division and struggle within the ruling group caused by the national crisis and class struggle. The Guangxu Emperor and a few ministers who supported him demanded to break away from the suppression of the extreme diehards represented by Empress Dowager Cixi and inclined towards reforming the status quo. The activities of the reformers were therefore valued by the Emperor's faction, and Kang Youwei and his comrades obtained the power to approach the emperor and "participate in the implementation of the new policies" in the government. The Reform Movement and Guangxu combined. From June 11 to September 21, 1898, a series of reform decrees, including the abolition of the eight-legged essay, encouraging private industry, rewarding scientific inventions, allowing freedom of speech, preparing to convene a parliament, and implementing constitutional government, were issued through the Emperor's "edicts," finally turning the bottom-up, mass-based demands for reform into practical actions of top-down reform.

Why could the movement launched by the bourgeois reformers only be a reformist movement? An analysis of the characteristics of the emergence of capitalism and the Chinese bourgeoisie in China can make this clear.

Chinese capitalism emerged in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. The occurrence of capitalism and the formation of the bourgeoisie had two paths: one was from "officially-sponsored and merchant-managed" to privately-managed, where some landlords and bureaucrats transformed into capitalists or also had the status of capitalists. The other was where a few handicraft workshop owners or small and medium-sized merchants opened factories, developing from the petty bourgeoisie into the bourgeoisie. The first path had an advantage in the early stage of capitalism, and the second path mainly had some strength among overseas Chinese. After 1895, two different small factions of the Chinese bourgeoisie began to appear. The Revive China Society of Sun Yat-sen and Yang Quyun was one of them. Its members were petty-bourgeois intellectuals, urban petty bourgeoisie, and overseas Chinese capitalists. These people had little connection with feudal forces and had a stronger revolutionary nature. The reformers were the representatives of the bourgeoisie transformed from landlords and bureaucrats. The members of this faction were mainly semi-feudal and semi-capitalist intellectuals, founders of new domestic enterprises, dissatisfied small and medium-sized officials, and local gentry. Kang Youwei, Tan Sitong, Liang Qichao, Yan Fu, and others were all from feudal families, received Confucian education, and also dabbled in some Western bourgeois sociological doctrines and natural sciences. They were representatives of the semi-feudal and semi-capitalist intellectuals who were devoted to learning from the West at that time. Some of the reformers were also founders of various new-style enterprises. Tan Sitong, Tang Caichang, and Liu Songfu opened mining, inland river shipping, and Xiang-Guangdong railway companies in Hunan. Kang Guangren engaged in business in his early years and founded the Datong Translation Bureau in Shanghai. Song Yuren was the head of the Chongqing Glass and Coal Mining Company and the founder of rickshaws in Chengdu. Liu Guyu opened machine cotton ginning factories and other enterprises in Shaanxi. Zhang Jian was an industrialist. Liang Qichao also had close relations with capitalists in Macau and other places. The memorials repeatedly submitted to the Censorate from 1895 to 1898 were all intellectuals with the title of "Juren," and the participants of the Study Society for National Strengthening and the National Protection Society were all scholar-officials and sons of landlord-bureaucrats. These people were not the ruling faction and also demanded the development of capitalism and had contradictions with feudal forces, but their status was very weak and had countless connections with feudal forces, and they had no revolutionary demands. Therefore, when attempting to solve the problems of national independence and the development of capitalism in China, this force could not imagine adopting revolutionary methods but could only choose the reformist path that they considered the most feasible.

It is very clear that the Reform Movement did not diminish its patriotism because it was a reform movement. One of the most important contents of the reformers' propaganda was the repeated reiteration of the crisis of national subjugation and the hatred of the landlord class power-holders who sold out the country and flattered foreign powers. In a letter to Ouyang Zhonghu, Tan Sitong vehemently criticized the Qing government for dragging China into the abyss of national destruction, "China's lifeline is feared to be entirely handed over to others. Not only the country, but all living beings, no one family will not perish... If China does not reform to seek revitalization, and allows foreigners to enter and change it on its behalf, then the rights to make a living and care for the dead will be controlled by foreigners, and the 400 million yellow people can all become slaves of the white race, that is, all be transformed into the Ainu of Japan, the Red Indians of America, and the black slaves of India and Africa"! Kang Youwei gave a speech at the National Protection Society about the tragic consequences of national subjugation, pointing out: "Since February, the loss of land and power has been seen twenty times. The future is long, how can we end the year? Burma, Annam, India, and Poland, we will continue to be their successors... Hong Kong belongs to the British, and there is still no imperial examination, and people regard being a comprador as the greatest honor. Even the poorest of the British can become taipans, while our wealthy Chinese, with the titles of Daotai and Fudao, and red and blue buttons, are mostly compradores for a foreign firm. Standing by their side, looking up to their faces, alas! If we do not strengthen ourselves now, I am afraid that the most honorable of our 400 million people in the future will be nothing more than this." These kinds of remarks by reformers, to a certain extent, expressed the demands of the broad masses of people to oppose imperialist aggression and feudal rule, which was beneficial to stimulating the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. The slogan of "saving the nation from peril and seeking survival" contained both the meaning of saving the landlord and bourgeoisie from ruin and saving China from ruin, and it was still a patriotic slogan at that time. It was precisely this situation that enabled the spokespersons of the bourgeoisie to present themselves as if they were not speaking on behalf of a particular class, but on behalf of the entire suffering Chinese people.

However, the reformers only put forward the distant goals of solving the problem of national independence and China's path to capitalism, and did not fundamentally solve the problem of relying on what forces to achieve this goal. This determined that their movement could only end in failure and would have no other future.

The bourgeoisie was of course a new force. The emergence of the reformers showed that the Chinese bourgeoisie had begun to step onto the political stage, and the era of solely relying on peasants to promote historical development had passed. But the fact proved that whether it was the vast force against feudalism or anti-imperialism, it was among the peasant masses, and the bourgeoisie would accomplish nothing without leaving the peasants. At this time, peasant struggles in various places were becoming active, and putting forward relatively clear anti-imperialist slogans from the struggles was a sign of the peasants' new awakening. The reformers dared not face this fact. The activities of the reformers not only did not agree with the struggle of the peasant masses, but were also directly opposed. They felt the threat of the peasant struggle to the ruling class and suffered from a fear of revolution. Kang Youwei deeply felt that "Chen She dropped his hoe on the ridge, and Shi Le leaned and whistled at the east gate... raising poles and chopping wood can already cause concern and danger." Therefore, they regarded their movement as having the significance of alleviating domestic class contradictions and resisting the peasant revolution. Conversely, the reformers were not only compromising with feudal forces, but also compromising with imperialism. Their patriotic thought did not develop into anti-imperialist thought. According to the reformers' point of view, the problem was not foreign aggression, but China's failure to strengthen itself. Therefore, they were unwilling to regard their movement as an anti-imperialist movement and even fantasized that China could rely on the support of a certain imperialism to complete the task of self-strengthening and transformation. The conspiracies and tricks played by Britain and Japan also deepened the reformers' illusion of relying on imperialism. Hostility to the peasants and seeking support from imperialism was the line of the reformers. This kind of political activity that did not receive the support of the people was of course unable to withstand the attack of the reactionary forces. Once the diehards represented by Empress Dowager Cixi launched a counterattack, the Reform Movement quickly vanished like a spring dream. Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao fled, Tan Sitong and other six gentlemen were killed, and even Guangxu himself could not escape the fate of being a prisoner. As the reformer poet Huang Zunxian lamented: "Reforming laws in the five continents all shed blood, and the reform cases are all overturned first." Within a month, all the new policies were banned, and all the old systems were restored.

The failure of the Reform Movement declared the bankruptcy of reformism. The Boxer Rebellion, which occurred a little more than a year later and was dominated by peasants, truly prevented the imperialist partition of China and gave the feudal forces a serious blow. The revolutionary struggle of the peasant masses completed the historical task that the bourgeois reformers could not complete.

As a political struggle, the Reform Movement was only a flash in the pan and has long passed into history. As a bourgeois ideological enlightenment movement, it had considerable influence in social life in the past sixty years. In order to defeat the feudal diehard forces on the cultural and ideological front, the reformers, according to their needs, absorbed Western bourgeois political and social doctrines to launch fierce debates with the spokespersons of feudal culture. In the struggle between the two ideological factions, feudal culture and thought suffered an unprecedented blow. Kang Youwei's "New Learning Forgery Classics Examination," "Confucius' Reform Examination," and "Commentary on the Li Yun," Tan Sitong's "Ren Xue," Liang Qichao's "Discourse on Reform," and Yan Fu's translation of "Evolution and Ethics," for the first time broke through the feudal net, fundamentally shaking the Confucian classics, which had always been regarded as the constitution of feudal politics, and causing bourgeois "civil rights" thought to begin to spread widely. This was a great liberation of thought. Feudal culture and thought had ruled China for thousands of years, and the minds of intellectuals were heavily bound. It is conceivable how difficult it was to eliminate these constraints and put forward a set of propositions that were fundamentally opposed to feudal culture and thought and could inspire the masses to awaken. But once the door of feudalism and mysticism was opened, even if it was only a very small crack, it could never be closed again to prevent people from coming out to pursue the ideals of bourgeois democracy and even further pursuing the ideals of proletarian socialism. After this, there have been several high tides of ideological emancipation struggles in China. These high tides have always accompanied the changes in the economic and political life of the time and, in turn, promoted economic and political development. The debate between the Tongmenghui and the reformists after 1905 was a second emancipation movement of bourgeois thought. In this debate, bourgeois revolutionary thought defeated reformism, preparing for the Xinhai Revolution. After the Russian October Revolution, Marxism was introduced into China, and the advanced elements of China found the revolutionary weapon of Marxism-Leninism, the important significance of which cannot be compared with the ideological emancipation struggle of the bourgeoisie. After the May Fourth Movement, the establishment of the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese revolution entered the New Democratic Revolution from the Old Democratic Revolution, finally embarked on the road to victory. The socialist revolution on the ideological front and the ideological emancipation movement of hundreds of millions of working people that are currently underway are even more unprecedented high tides of ideological emancipation in Chinese history. The large number of new things that appear every day shows that this high tide of ideological emancipation is thoroughly changing the long-term enslaved spiritual outlook of the Chinese people and promoting the rapid advancement of Chinese society from socialism to communism. These ideological emancipation struggles, one after another, occurred under different historical backgrounds and different guiding ideologies and have no direct connection with Reform thought and are not of the same nature. However, the bourgeois ideological enlightenment movement sixty years ago, for the first time, broke through the serious and difficult obstacle of feudal culture and thought, opened minds to re-understand the world, which eliminated a difficulty for people to continuously accept new ideas under new social living conditions and gave an inspiration. In this respect, the reformers are meritorious.

Sixty years is only a brief glimpse of history. The fundamental issues currently put before us are no longer national independence and the development of capitalism, but how to build socialism quickly, well, and economically and accelerate the advance towards communism. The social class forces that formed the reformers have long been buried by history and are not noticed by people. The "world of great harmony, where the world is for all, with no classes and complete equality," described by Kang Youwei with extraordinary imagination, was only a fantasy sixty years ago, but today it is becoming a reality. What a great change this should be. China, located in the East and which once influenced the world with its ancient culture, is progressing so rapidly, indicating that the day of entering the "world of great harmony" is not far away. Any reactionary forces that hinder this progress will be crushed by the wheels of history.

    戊戌变法六十年
    刘大年
    戊戌变法过去整六十年。中国在这个短时间内，经历了资产阶级民主革命和无产阶级社会主义革命两个步骤。变法所提出的问题，那些活动的阶级、人物和思想，在今天看来真是恍如隔世。但是，变法维新作为中国民族觉醒过程中的重要一环，是有长久意义的。
    从戊戌变法往前数六十年，中国正在开展轰轰烈烈的禁烟斗争，是中英鸦片战争前夕。鸦片战争、太平天国农民革命，英法联军的侵略、中法战争、中日甲午战争等一系列的重大事变，都发生在这个时间里。各次事变证明，这时中国仍只有农民是推动历史的力量，农民是反封建斗争的发动者，又是反侵略斗争的主力。代表大地主，大官僚和满清贵族统治的清朝政府，害怕人民，不敢坚决抵抗外国的侵略，使中国每次对外战争都遭失败。帝国主义强迫这个政府订立大批不平等条约来奴役中国人民，地主统治势力也逐步和外国相结合，变成侵略者的工具。在这个六十年的后期，一方面是英、美、法、俄、德、日等帝国主义的侵略，把中国变成了一个半殖民地半封建社会，一方面是中国出现了资本主义这种新的生产方式。特别是中日战争后的再一次割地狂潮，使中国面临着瓜分危险，而民族工业又正显露其活力。挽救民族危亡，发展资本主义，成了社会生活提出的两个最根本、最迫切的问题。
    这时农民斗争的第一个高潮已经过去，农民斗争的再起和资产阶级的革命潮流还在后面。中国工人阶级当时处在早期，是一个自在的阶级。于是，寻求这两个问题的答案的责任，不得不暂时地由资产阶级维新派这个不成熟的力量承担起来。中国资产阶级发动政治运动便从戊戌变法开始。
    “变法维新”，是资产阶级维新派对这两个问题所提出的回答。变法本是一个陈旧口号，当它和资产阶级的要求相结合，加进了比较完备的资本主义内容以后，就有了新的意义。在这以前，有许多人宣传变法，要求保护工商业，要求国家独立，要求清政府作某些民主改革。这些思想和代表官僚买办利益的洋务派的主张之间还没有很明确的界线。维新派与此有别，他们要求发展工商业，并主张改变封建专制政体。照康有为的话说是“上体太尊而下情不达”，“小变不可，必当全变”。康有为在“统筹全局”折里代表维新派宣布的纲领共有三条：统筹全局以图变法，大誓群臣以定国是，开制度局以定宪法。一为通盘改革行政机构，二为依靠皇帝的权力推行新政，三为改变专制政体，并使维新派参予政权。这显然不是别的纲领，是一个资产阶级的政治纲领。维新派站在历史潮流的前端，在中国扮演着第一个资产阶级政治代表的角色。
    群众性的活动和自上而下的改良活动相结合，是维新运动的一个特点。1895年康有为发起的一千三百余人联名要求“拒和、迁都、变法”的“公车上书”是这个运动的第一声。公车上书以后维新派影响散布全国。各地学会学堂林立、报纸刊物大兴，议论蜂起。宣传变法，讲求新学走出少数人的圈子，变成一个群众性运动。欧榘甲描述当时举国士民，“家家言时务，人人谈西学”。梁启超记载湖南省的各府州县多设立学校学会，许多英气沉毅，年岁较轻的士人都参加活动。“无科第、无官阶，声名未显者而其数不可胜计”。但是维新派的活动也仅仅限于利用学会报刊进行宣传号召，希望得到清政府中某些中央大员和地方督抚的赞助来推行他们的政治改革主张。这就清楚的表明了维新运动的改良主义性质。严重的民族危机、维新运动的浪潮必然要在清政府内部引起尖锐的反映。所谓帝党后党之争，主要的绝不是什么宫庭琐事的纷争，而是民族危机，阶级斗争所引起的统治集团内部的分裂与斗争。光绪和少数拥护他的大臣，要求摆脱以那拉氏为代表的极端顽固派的压制，倾向于改革现状。维新派的活动因而得到帝党的重视，康有为和他的同志在政府中取得了接近皇帝，“参行新政”的权力。维新运动和光绪结合起来。1898年6月11日到9月21日通过皇帝“谕旨”发布的包括废除八股，奖励民办工业，奖励科学发明，允许言论自由，准备召开国会，实行宪政等等一系列的改革法令，使自下而上的带有群众性的变法要求，终于变为自上而下进行改革的实际行动。
    为什么资产阶级维新派发动的运动，只能是一个改良主义的运动呢？分析一下中国资本主义产生和中国资产阶级的特点就可以明白。
    中国资本主义是在半殖民地半封建社会里产生的。资本主义的发生和资产阶级的形成有两条道路：一条是由“官商合办”进至商办，若干地主官僚顺着这条道路变为资本家或兼有资本家的身份。一条是少数手工工场主或中小商人开设工厂，由小资产阶级发展为资产阶级。第一条道路在资本主义发生初期占有优势，第二条道路主要是华侨中有些力量。1895年以后，中国资产阶级开始出现两个不同的小派别。孙中山、杨衢云的兴中会是其中的一派。它的成员是小资产阶级知识分子、城市小资产阶级和华侨资本家。这些人同封建势力的联系很少，有较强的革命性。维新派则是从地主官僚转化来的资产阶级的代表者。这一派的成员主要是半封建半资本主义的知识分子，国内新式企业的创办者，不满现状的中小官吏和地方绅士。康有为、谭嗣同、梁启超、严复等都是出身封建家庭，受儒家教育，又涉猎过一些西方资产阶级社会学说和自然科学的知识分子。他们是当时倾心向西方学习的半封建半资本主义知识分子的代表人物。维新派中有些人本身又是各种新式企业的创办者。谭嗣同、唐才常、刘淞芙等在湖南开办采矿，内河轮船，湘粤铁路等企业。康广仁早年经商，在上海创设大同译书局。宋育仁是重庆玻璃、煤矿公司主持者和成都人力车创行人。刘古愚在陕西开设机器轧花厂等企业。张骞是一个实业家。梁启超和澳门等处资本家的关系也很密切。1895至1898年先后多次向都察院上书的都是有“举人”功名的知识分子，强学会，保国会的参加者全是士大夫和地主官僚子弟。这些人不是当权派，又要求发展资本主义，和封建势力有矛盾，但是他们的地位很软弱，和封建势力有千丝万缕的联系，没有革命要求。因此这种势力在试图解决民族独立问题和中国资本主义发展问题时，就不能设想可以采取革命的方法，而只能选择在他们看来是最可行的改良主义道路。
    这一点是很清楚的：维新运动并不因为是一个改良运动而减弱了它的爱国主义性质。维新志士们宣传中最重要的一个内容是反复申述亡国危机，痛恨地主阶级当权派卖国媚外。谭嗣同上欧阳忠鹄书，痛斥清政府把中国拖向亡国灭种的深渊，“中国之生死命脉惟恐不尽授之于人。非唯国也，将合含生之类，无一人一家之不亡……中国不变法以期振作，使外洋入而代为变之，则养生送死之利权一操之外人，可使四百兆黄种之民，胥为白种之奴役，即胥化为日本之虾夷、美利坚之红皮土番、印度、阿非利加之黑奴”！康有为在保国会讲演亡国惨祸，指出：“二月以来，失地失权之事已二十见。来日方长，何以卒岁？缅甸、安南、印度、波兰吾将为其续矣。……香港隶英人，至今尚无科第，人以买办为至荣。英人之窶贫者皆可为大班，吾华人百万之富，道府之衔，红蓝之顶，乃多为其一洋行之买办。立侍其侧，仰视颜色，呜呼哀哉！及今不自强，恐吾四万万人他日之至荣者不过如此也”。维新人士的这类言论，是在一定程度上表达了广大人民群众反对帝国主义侵略、反对封建统治的要求，是有利于激发群众爱国热情的。“救亡图存”的口号虽含有救地主资产阶级之亡和救中国之亡两种意思，在当时仍是一个爱国的口号。正是这种情形，使资产阶级的代言人能够标榜自己仿佛不是代表某一个阶级发言，而是代表着整个受苦难的中国人民。
    然而维新派到底只是提出了解决民族独立问题，中国走资本主义道路问题的远大目标，根本没有解决依靠什么力量来实现这个目标的问题。这决定他们的运动只能以失败而告终，不会有别的前途。
    资产阶级当然是一个新的力量。维新派的出现，表明中国资产阶级已开始走上政治舞台，单纯由农民推动历史发展的时代已成过去。但事实证明，不论是反封建或反帝国主义的广大力量是在农民群众之中，资产阶级离开农民就要一事无成。这时各地农民斗争正趋向活跃，从斗争中开始提出比较明确的反帝口号更是农民新觉醒的标志。维新派不敢正视这个事实。维新派的活动不但和农民群众的斗争各不相谋，而且是正面对立的。他们感到农民斗争对统治阶级的威胁，患着革命恐惧症。康有为深感“陈涉辍耕于陇上，石勒倚啸于东门……揭竿斩木，已可忧危”。因此，他们把自己的运动看作具有缓和国内阶级矛盾，抵制农民革命的意义。反之，维新派不止对封建势力是妥协的，对帝国主义也是妥协的。他们的爱国思想并没有发展为反帝思想。照维新派的观点，问题不在于外国的侵略，而在中国不自强。因之他们不愿意把自己的运动当做反帝国主义运动，甚至幻想中国可以依靠某个帝国主义的支持完成自强改造的事业。英国、日本玩弄的阴谋诡计也加深了维新派依赖帝国主义的幻想。敌视农民，向帝国主义寻求支持，就是维新派的路线。这种得不到人民群众支持的政治活动当然是经不起反动势力的一击的。那拉氏代表的顽固派一经发动反攻，变法维新便像一场春梦迅速破灭。康梁出亡，谭嗣同等六君子被杀，连光绪本人也不免作阶下囚的命运。正如维新诗人黄遵宪所咏叹的：“五洲变法皆流血，先累维新案尽翻”。一个月之内禁止了全部新政，恢复全部旧制。
    变法维新失败，宣布了改良主义的破产。在一年多以后发生的以农民为主体的义和团运动才真正阻止了帝国主义瓜分中国，并给予封建势力严重的打击。农民群众的革命斗争完成了资产阶级改良派所无法完成的历史任务。
    维新运动作为一场政治斗争，只是昙花一现，早成过去，作为一个资产阶级思想启蒙运动，在近六十年社会生活中却有相当的影响。维新派为要从文化思想战线上击败封建顽固势力，按照他们的需要，吸取西方资产阶级的政治社会学说来和封建文化代言人展开激烈论战。在两派思想的斗争中封建主义文化思想遭受到空前打击。康有为的“新学伪经考”、“孔子改制考”、“礼运注”。谭嗣同的“仁学”，梁启超的“变法通议”和严复翻译的“天演论”等著作第一次冲决封建网罗，从根本上动摇了历来当作封建政治的宪法看待的儒家经典，使资产阶级“民权”思想开始广泛传播。这是思想上的一个大解放。封建主义文化思想统治中国几千年，知识分子的头脑受着重重束缚，要排除这些束缚，提出一套与封建主义文化思想基本上相对立而能够启发群众觉醒的主张，其困难是可以想见的。但是封建主义、神秘主义的大门既经打开，那怕只是打开很小一道门缝，便再也无法关闭，以阻止人们走出来追求资产阶级民主主义的理想，乃至进一步追求无产阶级社会主义的理想。在这以后，中国有过几次思想解放斗争的高潮，这种高潮每次都是伴随着当时的经济政治生活变革出现的，反过来又推动经济政治的发展。1905年以后同盟会和改良派的论战，是资产阶级的思想再解放运动。这次论战中，资产阶级革命思想战胜改良主义，准备了辛亥革命。俄国十月革命以后马克思主义传入中国，中国先进分子找到了马克思列宁主义这个革命武器，它的重要意义无法和资产阶级的思想解放斗争相比。经过“五四”运动，中国共产党的成立，中国革命由旧民主主义进入新民主主义，最后走上胜利的道路。今天正在进行的思想战线上的社会主义革命和亿万劳动群众的思想大解放运动，更是中国有史以来未曾有过的思想解放高潮。每天出现的大量新事物表明，这次思想解放高潮正在彻底改变中国人民长期被奴役的精神面貌，促进中国社会迅速由社会主义向共产主义前进。这些一次又一次的思想解放斗争，是在不同的历史背景，不同的指导思想下发生的，和维新思想并无直接联系，不是一种性质。但是六十年前的资产阶级思想启蒙运动第一次突破封建主义文化思想这道严重难关，打开脑筋重新认识世界，这就为后来人们在新的社会生活条件下不断接受新的思想，扫除了一种困难，给了一种启发。在这一点上，维新派是有功绩的。
    六十年只是历史的短短一瞥。目前提在我们面前的根本问题，再也不是民族独立和发展资本主义，而是如何多快好省地建设社会主义，加速向共产主义前进的问题。形成维新派的那种社会阶级力量也早被历史埋葬，不为人们所注意。康有为以非凡的想像力描述过的“大同之世，天下为公，无有阶级，一切平等”的“极乐世界”。在六十年前只是一种空想，而今天正在成为现实，这该是多么大的变化。处在东方，并曾经以它的古老文化影响过世界的中国，进步如此神速，指明进入“极乐世界”之日已不在远。任何阻挡这种前进的反动势力，都是要被历史的巨轮所粉碎的。
