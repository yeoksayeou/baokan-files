——The Experience of the Yidu County Party Committee of the CCP in Leading the Iron and Steel Industry
  　Zhou Ti
    By August 14th, Yidu County had built a total of 15,004 factories of various types. Among them were 54 iron and steel plants, 12,773 fertilizer plants, 565 pesticide plants, and 303 farm tool plants. These factories directly promoted the development of agricultural production.

    Initially, the County Committee did not fully recognize the serious significance of running the iron and steel industry. It was thought that "iron and steel are not directly related to agriculture" and "iron and steel are difficult to handle." Later, as the reform of tools in rural areas intensified, the contradiction of the supply of iron and steel falling short of demand became increasingly apparent. The whole county needed 20,000 tons of iron and steel to realize "five transformations." Facing these living facts, the County Committee quickly clarified the relationship between iron and steel and agriculture in its guiding ideology and decided to put the development of the iron and steel industry in the primary position of developing all industries, and proposed to the people of the county to work hard for half a year to build 500 indigenous furnaces and 250 blast furnaces, and produce 80,000 to 100,000 tons of iron and steel.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of the iron and steel industry, the County Committee decided that Comrade Yan Zhenjiang, Secretary of the Secretariat, would be in charge of industry, and a County Committee Industrial Leading Group was formed, headed by the First Secretary, and seven cadres were transferred to form a County Committee Industrial Office. Subsequently, more than 200 cadres and more than 20,000 laborers were transferred to the iron and steel industry. In this way, the iron and steel industry was quickly launched in a very short period of time.

    The County Committee initially lacked experience in running the iron and steel industry, and did not even know what an indigenous furnace or a blast furnace was. Faced with this arduous task, the County Committee decided to send people to Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, to learn, and to send people to Xiannvdong, which is rich in minerals and abundant in water resources, for key experiments and technical research. In early July, the first key furnace of the County Committee - the indigenous blast furnace of the Xiannvdong Iron Plant - flowed out the first furnace of iron. Subsequently, the Gulao Bei Town also smelted pig iron. The mysterious view of iron smelting has since been broken.

    Qu Ganbu (district cadre) Shi Jicang was one of the first to run to the front of iron smelting. Upon hearing the call of the higher authorities to vigorously develop the iron and steel industry, he personally carried ore from the mountains and used the iron-smelting furnace of the farm tool factory to smelt iron. The first time failed. However, he was not discouraged. The next day, he mobilized workers to carry back 280 kilograms of ore and changed to a larger furnace for smelting. Charcoal, ore, and limestone were layered on top of each other. But the second time also failed.

    Many people with conservative ideas began to waver. Comrade Shi Jicang encouraged everyone to continue working on the one hand, and invited Master Cao from Xiannvdong to help him improve the bottom of the furnace. After five days and five nights of hard work and eight failures, iron finally flowed out.

    The County Committee seized these two red flags, immediately spread them throughout the county by telephone, and organized cadres and the masses to visit and study. Zhouyang Township creatively learned from the experience of Xiannvdong and Gulao Bei in building furnaces and smelting iron, and built eight indigenous furnaces in ten days.

    Despite the successful experience, some people still had no confidence in running the iron and steel industry. Peng Xianzhou, Secretary of the Communist Party Branch of Qunqiao Cooperative in Zhanxin Township, said: "Making iron and steel is like taking treasure from the fire. We are the ones holding hoes. It is not a simple matter to turn stones into water." The Deputy Secretary of the Gushui Township Branch also said: "Making iron and steel is like blowing a trumpet. There is only exhalation and no inhalation." In response to this situation, the County Committee used the favorable conditions of the on-site meeting to launch the masses to conduct a major debate on issues such as whether running the iron and steel industry would affect agricultural production and whether farmers could run the iron and steel industry.

    Does making iron and steel conflict with agricultural production? Zhouyang Township answered this question. The township has a total of 2,224 laborers, and 10% of the labor force was drawn to engage in the iron and steel industry. Eight furnaces were built in ten days. Not only did it not affect agricultural production, but also won the red flag of the leap forward type 1 township in the county committee's agricultural general inspection.

  Can people who hold hoe handles run the iron and steel industry? The facts of Zhouyang Township also gave an affirmative answer. The township does not have an engineer or technician. It all depends on the hard work of eight apprentices to produce iron. Wu Zhirong, a farmer, had only studied for one year in the past. After more than a month of hard work, he is now able to independently build furnaces and operate them.

    Are the masses willing to run the iron and steel industry? The facts of Yongle Cooperative in Yong'an Township also gave an answer. In the past, the people of this cooperative always thought that there was no way out in the mountainous area and prepared to move to the plains. This time, after hearing that the township was going to build an iron and steel plant, those who originally planned to move are no longer moving, and they also invested 400 yuan to run the iron and steel industry.

    After the great debate and on-site visits, people's minds were liberated. In Liu Xiang District, two indigenous furnaces were built in five days. Wangjiaban District designated 77 cooperative cadres and 1,258 cooperative members to run iron and steel plants, ensuring that every cooperative had an indigenous furnace.

    From the end of the on-site meeting on July 18th to August 14th, 182 indigenous furnaces were built in the county (a total of 198 including those built before), with an average of seven new furnaces built every day, producing a total of 22.3 tons of pig iron.

    The lack of technical force is a major difficulty in vigorously developing the iron and steel industry. The County Committee adopted the method of "master leading apprentice" and "first come leading later" to train a large number of technical workers. When the County Committee was focusing on Xiannvdong, it notified other townships and cooperatives preparing to build furnaces to send people to Xiannvdong to study; when these people returned to their townships to build furnaces, the townships concentrated a group of people to study at the place where the furnace was built. In this way, like a "snowball," in a very short period of time, there was only one person in the county who knew how to smelt iron, and soon it developed to more than 200 people who knew the general techniques of furnace construction and operation. When solving the problem of insufficient technical force, Zhouyang Township extracted eight people from the 83 people who first went to the construction site to take turns studying in other places, adopting the method of "studying one shift and leaving one shift," each shift studying for two days and returning to practice for two days. This not only seized the time but also accelerated the speed of furnace construction and the training of technical workers. This township has recently transferred more than 50 people who understand general technical operations to form a technical team, which is studying on the one hand and conducting technical guidance throughout the township on the other hand, solving many technical difficult problems.

    What if there is no power and equipment? According to the experience of Xiannvdong in using water power to blow air, the County Committee put forward the method of "one dragon along the water, encircling the mountain when encountering the mountain," making full use of various favorable conditions in nature to reduce and eliminate physical labor. "One dragon along the water" is because there is less and more dispersed iron ore in the plains, and encircling the mountain can save a lot of labor and time for transporting raw materials. Zhicheng District Zhifang Township used the stream water of the Jiudao River to build a group of indigenous furnaces (a total of eight indigenous furnaces). If manual labor is used, just pulling the bellows would require a dozen people every day. After using water power, only one person is needed to manage it every day. Now the county has built "five dragons," which can save thousands of laborers every day.

　　书记挂帅　钢铁挂帅
　　——中共宜都县委领导钢铁工业的经验
  　周惕
    宜都县至8月14日止，全县共建成了各种工厂一万五千零四个。其中钢铁厂五十四个，化肥厂一万二千七百七十三个，农药厂五百六十五个，农具厂三百零三个。这些工厂直接地促进了农业生产的发展。
    开始，委县对办钢铁工业的严重意义是认识不足的。认为“钢铁与农业关系不直接”、“钢铁难办”。后来，农村里大搞工具改革，钢铁供不应求的矛盾愈益显露出来，全县要实现“五化”，需要钢铁二万吨。面对着这些活生生的事实，县委的指导思想很快就明确了钢铁同农业的关系，决定把发展钢铁工业放到发展一切工业的首要地位，向全县人民提出了苦战半年，修建土炉五百，高炉二百五十，生产钢铁八万至十万吨。
    为了加强对钢铁工业的领导，县委决定书记处书记阎振江同志专管工业，并以第一书记为首，组成了县委工业领导小组，抽调七名干部，组成了县委工业办公室。接着，又抽调了二百多名干部和二万多个劳动力投入了钢铁工业，这样，钢铁工业就在很短的时间内迅速上马了。
    县委对办钢铁工业开始是缺乏经验的，甚至连什么是土炉、什么是高炉都不知道。在这个艰巨的任务面前，县委决定一方面派人去山西阳城县学习，一方面派人去矿产丰富、水利资源充足的仙女洞重点试验、钻研技术。7月初，县委的第一个重点炉——仙女洞铁厂办的土高炉流出了第一炉铁水，接着，古老背镇也炼出了生铁。炼铁的神秘观点从此打破了。
    区干部史纪仓是跑在炼铁最前面的一个。他听到上级大办钢铁工业的号召，就亲自到山上背回矿石利用农具厂的化铁炉炼铁，第一次失败了。但是，他并不灰心，第二天又动员工人们挑回了二百八十斤矿石，并改用大炉子炼，木炭、矿石、石灰石一层层装好。可是第二次也失败了。
    许多有保守思想的人开始动摇。史纪仓同志一面鼓励大家继续干，一面将仙女洞曹师傅请来，在他帮助下，将炉底进行了改进，经过五天五夜的苦战，八次失败，最后终于流出了铁水。
    县委抓住了这两面红旗，马上用电话向全县进行了传播，并组织干部和群众去参观学习。洲阳乡创造性的学习了仙女洞和古老背的建炉炼铁的经验，在十天中建成了八部土炉。
    尽管有了成功的经验，然而，有些人对于办钢铁工业还是没有信心。中共崭新乡群桥社支部书记彭先洲说：“搞钢铁是火中取宝，我们是拿锄头的，要石头变成水，不是简单事。”古水乡支部副书记也说：“搞钢铁是吹喇叭，有出气没进气。”针对这种情况，县委利用现场会的有利条件，发动群众就办钢铁工业会不会影响农业生产、农民能不能办钢铁等问题，开展了大争大辩。
    搞铁是否与农业生产有矛盾呢？洲阳乡给这个问题作了回答。这个乡共二千二百二十四个劳动力，抽出了10％的劳动力搞钢铁，十天建成八座炉子，不仅未影响农业生产，在县委农业大检查中，还夺得了跃进一类乡的红旗。
  捏锄头把的人能不能办钢铁呢？洲阳乡的事实，也作了肯定的回答。这个乡没有一个工程师，一个技术员，全凭八个学徒的刻苦钻研，出了铁水。农民吴志荣过去只读过一年书，经过一个多月的努力，现在已能单独建炉和操作。
    群众愿不愿意办钢铁呢？永安乡永乐社的事实也做了回答。以前，这个社的人总认为山区没有出路，准备搬到平原去，这次听说乡里要办钢铁厂，原来打算搬家的现在不搬了，而且还把四百元投资办钢铁。
    经过大辩论和现场参观，人们的思想解放了，刘巷区五天就建成了二座土炉。王家畈区指定了七十七个社干部、一千二百五十八个社员办钢铁厂，做到社社有土炉。
    从现场会结束的7月18日起至8月14日止，全县建成了土炉一百八十二座（连以前建成的共一百九十八座），平均每天新建七座，共生产了生铁二十二点三吨。
    技术力量不足，是大办钢铁工业中的一个很大困难。县委采取了“师傅带徒弟”“先来带后来”的办法，培养了大批技术工人。当县委在仙女洞搞重点时，就通知其他准备建炉的乡社，派人去仙女洞学习；这批人回乡建炉时，乡里又集中一批人来建炉的地方学习。这样，像“滚雪球”一样，在很短时间内，原来全县只有一个懂得炼铁技术的人，很快就发展到有二百多人懂得一般的建炉和操作技术了。洲阳乡在解决技术力量不足的问题时，从先到工地去的八十三人中，抽出八人分班轮流到外地学习，采取了“学一班走一班”的办法，每班学习两天，回来实习两天，这样既抓住了时间，又加快了建炉速度和训练了技术工人。这个乡最近在抽调了五十多个懂得一般技术操作的人，组成技术团，一面学习，一面在全乡范围内进行技术辅导，解决了不少技术疑难问题。
    没有动力和设备怎么办？县委根据仙女洞利用水力鼓风的经验，提出了“遇水一条龙，碰山围山包”的办法，充分利用了大自然的各种有利条件，减少和消灭体力劳动。“遇水一条龙”是因为平原地区铁矿较少、分散，采取围山包，可以节省大量的原材料运输的劳动力和时间。枝城区纸坊乡利用九道河的溪水，建立了一个土炉群（共八个土炉），如果用人工，光拉风箱，每天就得十几个人，运用水力后，每天只要一个人管理就行了。现在全县已经建成了“五条龙”，每天可以节省成千个的劳动力。
