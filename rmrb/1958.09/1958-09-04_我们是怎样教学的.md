How We Teach
Zhenze County Jianshe Township First Agricultural Middle School

Agricultural middle schools bear the task of rapidly delivering a large number of laborers to the agricultural front who are both socialist-conscious, cultured, and have production skills. This requires us to implement the principle of combining theory with practice and closely integrating teaching with production in every subject. The half-work, half-study system embodies this. Therefore, the school is both a cultural position and a production outpost. Only in this way can we promote agricultural technology innovation and play an active role in advancing the early realization of the Agricultural Development Program. Below, we will discuss how we implement the principle of combining theory with practice and closely integrating education with production in teaching.

　　Language Arts
　　We not only emphasize the explanation of language knowledge, but also educate students in light of their current thinking. For example, in the initial stage of establishment, the school had no school buildings, desks, chairs, or textbooks; even the blackboard and chalk were borrowed. The students clamored, "We have nothing, what kind of school is this?" Some students even proposed "dropping out." The school was facing a tense moment. Just then, we taught a folk song that promoted collective power: "A Clever Shoemaker." During the lecture, we recited it many times, encouraging students to use collective power to overcome difficulties. The students were inspired, their confidence increased, and they launched a discussion on the topic of "How We Overcame Difficulties," carrying out a "Overcome Difficulties Blitz Day." The next day, some rowed boats, some carried, and some took things from more than ten miles away, moving desks and chairs, and solving the difficulties in the construction of the school.

    We often compare the difficulties encountered by the Red Army during the Long March with the difficulties we encounter today in learning and production technology. We use the examples of "Chairman Mao's visit to the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences" and "Manufacturing Grenade Launchers" to inspire students to break superstitions, liberate their minds, boldly innovate and create, and strive to liberate themselves from the state of being slaves to nature. Through the study of these two articles, student Chen Yulin was determined to learn from Comrade Wu Yunduo, overcome all difficulties, and create a new type of windmill.

    When teaching folk songs and short poems, we encourage students to boldly create in combination with current production, which not only improves students' writing skills, but also greatly encourages production enthusiasm. We published a construction site newsletter on the construction site, commending good people and deeds, and launching challenges and responses. On the day of the blitz to build the large dike, student Yan Wenhua wrote:

    The teacher takes the lead, the students are enthusiastic, like dragons entering the sea, for the sake of ten thousand catties of grain fields.

    The carrying pole is like a bow, the iron rake is like a spear, men and women compete, all are heroes.

    Mention the program, carry the load as if running, back and forth, very light.

    That afternoon, after lunch, just as teachers and students were rising up to fight again, suddenly dark clouds filled the sky, and a torrential rain came. New words appeared on the newsletter: "Agricultural Middle School, Agricultural Middle School, production pioneer," and everyone sang the leap forward song learned in language class, "Small rain is good for the day, heavy rain is a blitz." The momentum was even stronger.

    In addition to attaching importance to essay writing, we also improve students' writing skills by compiling jingles and publishing wall newspapers. This semester, we have already written seven articles and published five issues of the "Agricultural Middle School Life" wall newspaper. In "Agricultural Middle School Life," we wrote "Challenge Poetry" and tried the form of poetry in essays to praise our own rice satellite experimental field. For example, student Yan He Kui wrote:

    Protect ten thousand catties of grain, hold a double spray gun,

    Sweep away diseases and insect pests, protect the grain from the harvest.

    For the sake of ten thousand catties of grain, work hard,

    "Satellite" is launched into the sky, autumn harvest in Beijing.

    When the peasant masses set off a climax of setting up and accepting challenges, various challenges such as production, language arts, and arithmetic also appeared in the school, and our "Agricultural Middle School Life" added new content.

    Fifteen-year-old primary school student Qian Xing'an did not show weakness either, he said:

    Swallowing mountains and rivers shows enthusiasm, rush to the challenge to attack mathematics,

    Liberate the mind and break superstitions, not willing to give up without winning the championship.

    In addition to these short poems, rich and coherent short essays can often be seen in students' essays and wall newspapers. The strong reality and ideology expressed in these short essays and poems are also what we often praise and encourage in our daily teaching.

    Mathematics

    We also pay attention to combining mathematics teaching with production and linking it with practice through various methods. For example, when rushing to repair the large dike, we just talked about the calculation of area and volume, and came up with such a question:

    The entire school of 36 teachers and students completed a large dike 30 meters long, 2 meters high, 2 meters wide at the top, and 4 meters wide at the top and bottom in two days. What is its volume? How many cubic meters of earth does it add up to? How much did each person complete?

    The school planted five acres and eight points of rice experimental fields. In the past, this area was planted with "four, five" and "five, five" squares. In order to increase production, the school tried "two, five" and "three, five" squares. At that time, students doubted it, and some farmers did not agree. The school made a special report, explaining that this was one of the measures to increase production: as long as we cultivate deeply and carefully, apply sufficient base fertilizer, and strengthen field management, we will definitely not suffer from rice fever or lodging. We must boldly innovate and create ten thousand catties of experimental fields to cultivate the Rice King. When the "Ten Thousand Catties Field" and "Rice King" were proposed, some students shook their heads and stuck out their tongues, saying that this "cold water field" only received more than 500 catties at best last year, and now it is 20 times more, it takes the ability of the Eight Heavenly Kings to do it. Many students debated whether the ten thousand catties target could be achieved, and they did not give way to each other. We used the method of detailed accounting to verify whether this satellite could be launched:

    The density of the experimental field is 2.5 × 5 = 12.5 stalks /square foot, 48,000 hills per acre
    16 seedlings per hill, a total of 768,000 seedlings
    220 grains per ear, a total of 168,960,000 grains
    Calculated at 16,000 grains per catty, it is 10,560 catties/acre
    The total output of 5.8 acres is 612,480 catties

    This not only enabled students to learn new knowledge, but also powerfully convinced the masses that the "Ten Thousand Catties Satellite Field" would definitely be successful.

    These topics closely related to reality have greatly enlightened students, aroused their interest in learning, and inspired their thinking.

    Because of the close integration with practice, it not only aroused students' interest in learning, but also enabled students to apply the knowledge they have learned to life and production, and further consolidate the knowledge they have acquired.

    Agricultural Knowledge Class

    Our agricultural knowledge class determines the teaching content and formulates the teaching plan according to the needs of production, agricultural seasons, and students' original knowledge base, and resolutely implements the policy of serving production. For example, the main agricultural work in May, June, and July includes fertilizing orange trees, clearing gardens, weeding, pest control, loquat, peach thinning and picking, rice planting and field management, etc. We have included all these contents in the teaching plan, so that we learn what we plant and do after we learn. The main purpose is to solve practical problems in production technology, and appropriately improve it theoretically.

    To achieve the above requirements, teachers are a big problem. Full-time teachers are high school graduates and lack knowledge in this area. After research, we have adopted a combination of experienced farmers and full-time teachers. Experienced farmers teach agricultural technology classes, and full-time teachers supplement the content taught by experienced farmers from a theoretical perspective, which not only enables students to learn knowledge, but also master many practical skills. After lectures and internships, most people mastered the technology of pruning and grafting in a short period of time, and 13 people have reached the level of ordinary commune members, so the pruning task this year was completed ahead of schedule.

    In teaching, we especially emphasize the promotion of advanced technology and bold innovation and creation. Although there are many waxberry trees in our area, we don’t know how to grow seedlings ourselves, and the saplings are bought from other places. In order to change this situation, we learned the technology from other places and taught it to the students, and did the first waxberry seedling test. Now it seems that the thinned waxberries grow better than the unthinned ones, and the waxberry seeds have also germinated. In addition, we also included the county party committee's measures to increase production: garden clearing and weeding, and sweet potato plum blossom-shaped cutting method as teaching content. Therefore, our garden clearing and weeding is done better. For example, the first production team leader said after visiting: "If this mountain is not managed by the agricultural middle school, it will not be done like this in another five years. The agricultural middle school students have good ideas and accept quickly. In the future, if there is any advanced technology, please ask them to do it first." Our school has taken a series of advanced measures for the rice in the experimental field. The current growth situation is the first in the entire commune and the leading in the entire township. It is more than a foot higher than the seedlings planted a few days later by the Third Small Team. The entire commune held an on-site meeting and inserted four red flags in the field, and also awarded our school a banner of honor. After seeing it, the cadres and commune members said: "After seeing the experimental field of the agricultural middle school, we have increased our confidence in increasing production. The agricultural middle school is really a production pioneer, and we must catch up with the agricultural middle school."

    Because our agricultural knowledge class teaching is closely integrated with production, it is generally welcomed by cadres, the masses, students, and parents. For example, in the initial stage of running the school, when students' thoughts were turbulent, because the school taught students the fruit tree pruning technology that was most needed for production at that time, it not only consolidated the original students, but also many students who did not come to school returned to school to study. This incident greatly enlightened us and made us deeply realize that only when education serves politics and production can we consolidate the school and make it take root among the masses. Therefore, in future teaching, we have more resolutely implemented this policy. Now it seems that students have learned a lot of knowledge and skills, and therefore love the school more. They compiled such a clapper rhyme: "Agricultural middle school is really good, half-work and half-study is really wonderful, scientific culture is learned, technological revolution takes the lead, ideological and moral cultivation is good, thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party." Student Jin Lijun said: "These technical jobs, if I don't enter the agricultural middle school, I will never learn them." Parents are satisfied when they see their children's progress and say: "Entering the agricultural middle school has improved their culture and learned technology. They are both literate and martial arts. Chairman Mao is creating happiness for the people." Student Jin Yufeng's father said: "I have lived for 45 years and have never seen such a good school. They learn everything from making seedling fields, transplanting seedlings, pruning trees, and thinning fruits. They are really promising."

　　我们是怎样教学的
　　震泽县建设乡第一农业中学
    农业中学担负着以最快速度向农业战线上输送大批有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的、又有生产技能的劳动者的任务。这就要求我们在每一学科中贯彻理论联系实际，教学紧密结合生产的原则。半耕半读正体现了这一点。因此学校既是文化阵地，又是生产前哨。只有这样，才能促进农业技术的革新，对提前实现农业发展纲要起积极的推动的作用。下面来谈一谈，我们是怎样在教学中贯彻理论联系实际，教育紧密结合生产的。
    语文方面
    我们不仅重视语文知识的讲解，更结合了学生当前思想进行教育。例如创办初期，学校校舍、课桌椅、课本什么都没有，甚至黑板、粉笔也是借来的。学生吵着：“一样也没有，像啥个学堂。”个别学生甚至提出“退学”。学校面临紧张关头，正好这时教了一首发挥集体力量的民歌：“一个巧皮匠”。我们在讲授中多次朗诵，鼓励同学发挥集体力量克服困难，同学们受到鼓舞，增强了信心，并以“我们如何克服的困难”为题开展讨论，开展了一次“克服困难突击日”，第二天，有的摇船、有的挑、有的拿，从十多里外，搬来课桌椅，解决了建校中的困难。
    我们经常用红军长征中所遇到的困难和我们今天学习上、生产技术上所遇到的困难相比，用“毛主席访问浙江农科所”和“制造枪榴弹”的事例，启发学生破除迷信，解放思想，大胆革新创造，努力从作自然的奴隶的状态中解放出来。通过这二篇文章的学习，学生陈玉林决心向吴运铎同志学习，克服一切困难，创造新型风车一部。
    在教民歌短诗时，鼓励学生结合当前生产，大胆创作，不仅提高了学生的写作水平，也大大鼓舞了生产热情，我们在工地上出刊了工地快报，表扬好人好事，展开挑、应战，在突击修筑大圩子那天，学生严文华写道：
    老师一马当先，同学热火朝天，好似蛟龙入海，为了万斤粮田。
    扁担弓一样，铁耙像长枪，男女各争先，都是英雄将。
    提起纲要，挑担如跑，来来往往，交关轻飘。
    那天午饭后，正当师生奋起再战的时候，刹时乌云满天，一场倾盆大雨，快报上又出现了新的词儿：“农中农中，生产先锋”，大家也随着唱出了语文课上学过的跃进歌谣“小雨当天好，大雨突击搞”。劲头更加旺盛。
    我们除了重视作文教学外，更通过编顺口溜、出刊墙报提高学生写作水平，本学期已做七篇、出刊“农中生活”墙报五期，我们在“农中生活”里写了“擂台诗歌”，在作文里试用诗歌形式，歌颂我们自己种植的水稻卫星试验田。如学生严和奎写道：
    保卫万斤粮，手持双喷枪，
    猛扫病虫害，粒谷保登场。
    为了万斤粮，苦苦干一场，
    “卫星”放上天，秋收北京上。
    在农民群众掀起摆擂台打擂台的高潮时，学校里也出现了生产、语文、算术等各种擂台，我们的“农中生活”中增添了新的内容。
    十五岁的小学生钱兴安也不示弱，他说：
    气吞江山显干劲，冲上擂台攻数学，
    解放思想破迷信，不夺冠军不甘心。
    除了这些短小的诗歌以外，在学生的作文和墙报上，还经常可以看到内容丰富文理通顺的短文，这些短文和诗歌所表现的强烈的现实性和思想性，也正是我们平日教学中经常表扬和鼓励的。
    数学方面
    我们也注意通过各种方式结合生产、联系实际进行数学教学，如在突击修大圩的时候，正好讲到面积和体积计算，就出了这样一道问题：
    全校师生三十六人二天完成长三十公尺，高二公尺，顶宽二公尺，顶底宽四公尺的大圩子，它体积多少？合多少土方？每人完成多少？
    学校种了五亩八分水稻试验田，往年这儿都是种的“四、五”“五、五”方形，为了增产，学校试行“二、五”“三、五”方形。当时学生怀疑，部分农民也不赞成，学校为此作了专题报告，说明这是增产措施之一：只要深耕细作，施足基肥，加强田间管理，一定不会生稻热病或有倒伏现象。要大胆革新，创造万斤试验田，培养水稻王。当提出“万斤田”“水稻王”时，个别学生摇头伸舌地讲，这块“冷水田”，去年最好只收到五百多，现在相差二十倍，要八天王的本事才行了。不少学生对是否能实现万斤指标争论不休，互不相让。我们就用算细帐的办法来证实这颗卫星能否放得出来：
    试验田的密度平均　2.5×5　每亩48，000穴
    每穴　16根苗　共计768，000根
    每穗　220粒　共计168，960，000粒
    以每斤　16，000粒计算　合10，560斤／亩
    5.8亩总产量612，480斤
    这样不但使同学学到新的知识，并有力地说服群众，“万斤卫星田”一定能成功。
    这些与现实密切结合的题目，对学生启发很大，引起他们的学习兴趣，启发他们思维。
    由于密切结合实际，不仅启发了学生的学习兴趣，也使学生将学习到的知识，运用到生活与生产上去，进一步巩固了已得的知识。
    农业知识课方面
    我们的农知课是根据生产需要、农时季节和学生原有知识基础来确定教学内容，制定教学计划的，坚决贯彻为生产服务的方针。比如5、6、7月份的主要农活有橙桔树、施肥、清园、除草、治虫、杨梅、桃子的匀果与采摘，水稻的种植和田间管理等。我们就把这些内容全部列入教学计划，做到种啥学啥，先学后做。以解决生产技术上的实际问题为主，并适当在理论上给予提高。
    要达到上述要求，师资是一个很大的问题，专职教师是高中毕业生，缺乏这方面的知识，经过研究，我们采取了老农与专职教师相结合的办法，老农上农业技术课，专职教师配合老农讲的内容从理论上加以补充，不仅使学生学到了知识，而且掌握了许多实际的技能。经过讲授与实习，短期内大多数人掌握修剪嫁接的技术，有十三人已达到一般社员的水平了，因此使今年的修剪任务提前完成。
    在教学中我们特别重视推广先进技术和大胆革新创造。我们那里杨梅树虽然很多，但自己不会圃苗，树苗都是到外地买来的。为了改变这种情况，我们到外地学来技术后又教给学生，并第一次做了杨梅圃苗的试验。现在看来，匀果的杨梅比不匀的要长得好，杨梅种子也已经发芽了。此外，我们把县委贯彻的增产措施：果园清园除草与山芋梅花形扦插法，也作为教学内容，因此，我们园地的清园除草是做得较好的。如第一生产队长参观以后说：“这片山不是农业中学搞，再过五年也搞不到这个样子，农中学生思想好，接受快，今后有啥先进技术，先请他们搞出样子来。”我校对试验田里的水稻，采取了一系列的先进措施，现在的生长情况是全社第一，全乡领先。比晚种几天的三小队的禾要高出一尺多，全社开过现场会议在田里插了四面红旗，还发给我校一面奖旗。干部和社员看了以后说：“看了农中的试验田，增加了我们的增产信心，农中真是生产先锋，我们一定要赶农中”。
    由于我们的农知课教学密切结合生产，受到干部、群众、学生、家长的普遍欢迎。如办校初期，学生思想动荡时，由于学校把当时生产最需要的果树修剪技术教给了学生，不仅巩固了原有学生，许多不来校的学生也回校学习了。这一件事对我们的启发很大，使我们深刻的认识到只有教育为政治和生产服务，才能巩固学校，使学校在群众中扎根。所以在以后的教学中，我们更坚决贯彻了这一方针。现在看来，学生学到了很多知识与技能，因而更加热爱学校。他们编了这样一首快板：“农业中学真正好，半工半读实在妙，科学文化学到手，技术革命打头炮，思想品德修养好，多亏共产党好领导。”学生金丽君说：“这些技术活，不是进农业中学，永远也学不到。”家长看到孩子的进步满意的说：“进了农业中学，提高了文化，学到了技术，能文能武，毛主席为民造福。”学生金玉峰的父亲说：“我活了四十五岁，从来没有看见过这样的好学堂，做秧田、插秧、剪树、匀果，样样都学，真是大有前途。”
