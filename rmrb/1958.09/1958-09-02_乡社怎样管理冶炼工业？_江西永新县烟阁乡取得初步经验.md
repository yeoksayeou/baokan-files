How Do Townships and Communes Manage the Smelting Industry?
    Yange Township, Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, Obtains Preliminary Experience
    This newspaper, Yongxin, 1st dispatch: How to organize the management of the iron smelting industry in townships and communes? Yange Township, Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, has gained preliminary experience.
    Yange Township has a population of only over 8,000 (the original 14 cooperatives in the township have recently been merged into a people's commune), and "has never run an iron factory since the beginning of the world." However, relying on their own strength, they have built two 3-cubic-meter indigenous furnaces and are carrying out normal production. At present, they produce 2 to 3 tons of pig iron per day, and have produced about 40 tons of iron. Two 5-cubic-meter and one 8-cubic-meter indigenous furnaces will be completed in a few days, and eight "Hunan-style" small indigenous furnaces and one 5-cubic-meter furnace are about to be built. The daily pig iron production capacity of these indigenous furnaces is nearly 30 tons.
    In order to ensure that furnace construction and production are carried out simultaneously, and to achieve fast furnace construction and fast production, the Yange Township Party Committee promptly strengthened the management of the iron smelting industry. The Township Party Committee Secretary took the lead and established an Iron Smelting Industry Management Committee. The iron factories that have already been put into production and those that are about to be put into production will also establish factory affairs committees through democratic elections.
    In organizing the management of the iron smelting industry, they have focused on several tasks:
    First, grasping the training and improvement of technical personnel. Yange Township did not have anyone who understood iron smelting technology. In the past two or three months, they have trained dozens of technical personnel who can build furnaces, operate, and manufacture air blowing equipment (wooden bellows and wooden water turbines) by sending people out to visit and train, and then having one person bring several apprentices back to boldly experiment. They are tasked with the furnace construction and production tasks of these dozen or so furnaces. Now, it is necessary to continuously improve furnace construction and operation technology, and improve air blowing equipment to increase wind power and increase iron output. The Township Party Committee promptly organized a furnace construction and operation technology research group, a woodworking technology research group, and an ironworking technology research group to regularly study various technical issues in furnace construction and production.
    Second, grasping the allocation and collaboration of labor. First of all, when allocating agricultural and industrial labor, it is necessary to grasp accurately and firmly, and not miss the opportunity. In June, during the agricultural slack season, 200 laborers were immediately transferred to focus on furnace construction and material preparation. Secondly, organize the collaboration of various types of work. They organized more than 30 carpenters and more than 10 ironworkers in the township to focus on manufacturing air blowing equipment and various tools needed for mining and smelting operations, ensuring the needs of furnace construction and production in a timely manner.
    Third, grasping the establishment of factory production management systems.
    Fourth, grasping ideological work. The Yange Township Party Committee not only organized cadres and the masses to discuss and break through the ideological barrier to running the iron smelting industry when preparing to build furnaces, but also paid attention to grasping ideological leadership after the furnaces were built and put into production. When the first furnace was built and put into trial production, iron was not produced after two days and two nights of smelting. Some people wavered and were pessimistic, some were afraid of taking responsibility, and a cadre in charge of this furnace even claimed illness and went home. The Township Party Committee Secretary immediately convened a meeting of iron smelting workers and cooperative branch secretaries to criticize pessimistic emotions, and improved the water turbine to increase wind power, and improved the batching and charging methods, resulting in the rapid smelting of iron. The confidence of all cadres and the masses greatly increased.

　　乡社怎样管理冶炼工业？
    江西永新县烟阁乡取得初步经验
    本报永新1日电　乡社如何组织对炼铁工业的管理，江西省永新县烟阁乡已取得初步经验。
    烟阁乡只有八千多人口（全乡原有十四个合作社，最近已合并成立一个人民公社），而且“从开天辟地以来从未办过铁厂”，但是他们依靠自己的力量，已经建成二座三立方公尺的土炉，并进行正常生产。目前，日产生铁二吨至三吨，已产生铁约四十吨。二座五立方公尺和一座八立方公尺的土炉在几天内就可完工，八座“湖南式”小土炉和一座五立方公尺的土炉就要开始兴建。这些土炉日产生铁能力近三十多吨。
    为了保证建炉和生产同时并举，做到建炉快，生产也快，烟阁乡党委会及时加强了对炼铁工业的管理。乡党委书记挂帅，成立了炼铁工业管理委员会，已投入生产和将要投入生产的铁厂，也将通过民主选举成立厂务委员会。
    他们在组织炼铁工业的管理方面，抓紧了几项工作：
    第一，抓紧技术人员的培训和提高。烟阁乡原来没有一个懂得炼铁技术的人。两三个月来，他们通过派人出去参观、培训，回来后一个带几个徒弟，大胆进行试验的办法，培养了几十个能建炉、操作和制造鼓风设备（木风箱和木水轮机）的技术人员，由他们带一批徒弟，担负这十几个炉子的建炉和生产任务。现在，需要不断提高建炉和操作技术，并改进鼓风设备，增加风力，提高出铁量。乡党委及时组织了一个建炉和操作技术研究组，一个木工技术研究组，一个铁工技术研究组，经常研究建炉和生产中的各种技术问题。
    第二，抓紧劳动力的调配和协作，首先是在调配农业和工业的劳动力时要抓得准、抓得狠，不失时机，6月是农业小忙间隙，立即抽调了二百个劳动力突击建炉和备料。其次，组织各种工种的协作，他们把乡里三十多个木工和十多个铁工组织起来，突击制造鼓风设备以及挖矿石和冶炼操作所需的各种工具，及时保证了建炉和生产的需要。
    第三，抓紧建立工厂的生产管理制度。
    第四，抓紧思想工作。烟阁乡党委不仅在开始准备建炉时，组织干部和群众进行讨论，突破了办炼铁工业的思想关，而且在炉子建成投入生产后，也一直注意抓思想领导，在第一个炉子建成试生产时，炼了两天两夜还没有出铁，一些人动摇、悲观，一些人怕负责任，一个负责这个炉子的干部也称病回家了。乡党委书记立即召开炼铁工人和合作社支部书记会议，批判悲观情绪，并且改进水轮机，增加风力，改进配料下料方法，结果很快就炼出铁来。全体干部和群众信心大增。
