At the meeting, the workers unanimously angrily shouted slogans demanding that the American imperialists get out of China.

We Soviets are ready to use all our strength to help our Chinese brothers in any situation. The workers of this factory also unanimously passed a resolution condemning the aggressive acts of the American imperialists.

    On this day, the Moscow Heavy Machinery Factory and other factories near the Soviet capital also held mass protest rallies.

At a meeting held by workers at the Zhdanov Shipyard, fitter Balakirev said, "We want to tell the reckless aggressors: Get out of the Taiwan Strait!  No encroachment on Chinese land and territorial waters! Don't forget that the security interests of the People's China and the security interests of the Soviet people are inseparable."

    In Vladivostok, the faculty, staff, and students of the Far Eastern Industrial Institute also held a rally. Participants in the meeting resolutely protested the American imperialists' conspiracy to launch a new war.

    The conference heard a report by Nguyen Duc Qui, a member of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, on the situation in the Taiwan region. He said: "Damaging the interests of the 600 million fraternal Chinese people is damaging the interests of the Vietnamese people. Our reason and feelings require us to stand firmly with the Chinese people to oppose the American imperialists' blatant interference."

    The conference unanimously passed a resolution amidst warm applause, expressing full support for the Chinese government's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region, complete support for the struggle of the 600 million fraternal Chinese people to liberate their territory of Taiwan and coastal islands, and demanding that American troops immediately withdraw from the Taiwan region.

American imperialism is absolutely not allowed to interfere in China's liberation of Taiwan and China's coastal islands. We support the Chinese government's statement."

    Workers at the Mongolian National Printing Plant unanimously expressed their full support for Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region, the Mongolian government's statement on the 9th, and Khrushchev's warning letter to Eisenhower. At a rally of workers at the Ulan Bator Railway General Administration, female worker Do Legeer said, "Taiwan is Chinese territory, and any foreign troops here are illegal.
