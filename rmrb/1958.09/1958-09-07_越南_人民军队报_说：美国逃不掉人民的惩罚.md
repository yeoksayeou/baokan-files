Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 6th: The "People's Army Daily" (September 3rd edition) of the General Political Department of the Vietnamese People's Army recently published a commentary stating that China's liberation of its own territory, including Jinmen and Taiwan, is a matter internal to the Chinese people and is in the legitimate interests of the Chinese people. It said that infringing upon the People's Republic of China is infringing upon the entire socialist camp, and anyone who crazily and foolishly does such a thing will bring upon themselves a heavy and shameful defeat.

The commentary called on all commanders and fighters of the Vietnamese People's Army to constantly watch out for all provocative acts of the enemy, and at no time should they become complacent about the safety of the fatherland and the people.

The commentary pointed out that the criminal acts of U.S. imperialism cannot intimidate righteous people in the slightest. On the contrary, they can in no way escape the control of historical laws: the more ferocious imperialism is, the more severely it will be punished by the people.

    越南“人民军队报”说：美国逃不掉人民的惩罚
    据新华社河内6日电　越南人民军总政治部的“人民军队报”（三日刊）最近一期发表评论说，中国解放自己的领土金门和台湾等岛屿是中国人民内部的事情，是中国人民的正当利益。它说，侵犯中华人民共和国也就是侵犯整个社会主义阵营，谁要是疯狂地和愚蠢地干出这件事，那末它一定会给自己招来惨重的和可耻的失败。
    评论号召越南人民军全体指战员时时刻刻注视着敌人的一切挑衅行为，任何时候都不能对祖国和人民的安全问题产生任何的松懈。
    评论指出，美帝国主义的罪恶行为丝毫吓不倒正义的人们，相反，他们无论如何也不能摆脱历史规律的控制：帝国主义越是凶恶，就越要受到人民严厉的惩罚。
