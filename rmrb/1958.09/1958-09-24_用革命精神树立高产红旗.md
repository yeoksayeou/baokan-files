    Use Revolutionary Spirit to Establish High-Yield Red Flags
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    The national high-yield red flag for refractory materials has been raised at the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. In June of this year, they reduced the time it took to fire a kiln of clay bricks from sixty to eighty hours to nine hours and forty minutes. This creation allowed the Second Refractory Materials Workshop, with a small investment and some adjustments to the equipment of other processes, to increase production threefold, thereby essentially solving the need for refractory bricks caused by the threefold increase in steelmaking workshop output. Now this red flag is becoming more and more distinct. In August and September, their advanced kilns created new firing records of seven hours and ten minutes, and six hours and twenty minutes. Such records are unprecedented in the world.
    The economic significance of this high-yield red flag is considerable. This year, our steel production is to double, and iron production will be much higher than steel, which requires a large number of refractory materials. Relying on the construction of new factories to solve this problem not only requires a large investment, but also takes too much time. Now that the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has raised a high-yield red flag for refractory materials, if their rapid firing experience is promoted nationwide, the output of existing refractory material factories can be increased by two to three times without a large investment. If this advanced technology is adopted in future designs, the investment in refractory materials can be reduced by two-thirds. As you can see, this is a huge economic effect.
    However, it should be pointed out that the significance of this red flag is not only economic, but more importantly, it is a major technological revolution. Its emergence has overthrown the world-recognized and long-standing technical theories, and established new technical theories. In the past, people were governed by a heating curve when firing clay bricks. According to this curve, each kiln of clay bricks required at least thirty hours, and sometimes more than ninety hours. Why couldn't the kiln temperature be raised quickly to the required temperature? Because the books stated that if the temperature rose too quickly, the moisture in the brick blanks would evaporate too quickly, causing the bricks to crack and become waste products. For many years, people firing refractory bricks have taken this theory as the "holy decree," and no one dared to touch it.
    The situation of the Great Leap Forward has arrived, and the workers of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company are all eager to do a great job. First of all, the steel workers want to triple their output, which has sparked a debate in the refractory materials workshop. How can refractory bricks keep up? Some technicians advocate buying equipment, building factories, and expanding production. The workers said, no, this costs too much money and takes too long. We should think about how to increase output by changing the heating curve and shortening the firing time. The technicians searched through the books and could not find any theoretical basis, and opposed the workers' opinions. The workers questioned the technicians: "Can we only forever hold on to the dead regulations and not change them?" The workers, regardless of the technicians' opposition, boldly experimented with the support of the Party branch. In the process of experimentation, although they were constantly obstructed by some technicians, the workers bravely persisted in the experiment. The truth lies with the workers. As a result of the experiment, although the temperature rose rapidly, the refractory bricks were intact and did not affect the quality at all. Thus, the old heating curve went bankrupt, and the new heating curve was created.
    This seems like a risky thing, but it is not risky at all. People's ability to grasp the laws of the struggle for production gradually improves with the enrichment of production experience. It is inevitable that some technical theories and formulas summarized when people's production experience is not very rich will have some one-sidedness. It is also inevitable that some incomplete or even erroneous technical theories will be revised or even overthrown in the process of production practice. This is in accordance with dialectics. The valuable thing about the workers in the Second Refractory Materials Workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company is that they act in accordance with dialectics. They do not succumb to the formulas in the books, and dare to boldly overthrow the old and create the new based on practical experience. The worker comrades have rich production experience. In the past, due to insufficient ideological liberation, their creativity was not fully utilized. Now that their minds have been liberated, it is natural that miracles happen in their hands. Some people may wonder: why do some technicians resolutely oppose the workers' creations? This is not surprising either. Some technicians do not directly participate in production and lack practical production experience. They only use the formulas and dogmas in the books to guide production. Without the books, they can do nothing. Therefore, they dare not even think about whether the formulas in the books are reasonable, let alone create anything. The issue is not that they initially oppose, but how to learn lessons from this incident, put down the airs of technicians, delve into practice, participate in production, humbly learn from the workers, and train themselves into a technical person who is both red and expert.
    Now that the nation's steel production and capital construction are undergoing a Great Leap Forward, the shortage of refractory materials has become an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Therefore, the national refractory material industry should actively learn from the experience of the Second Refractory Materials Workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, and plant new high-yield red flags one after another. It can be believed that as long as we seriously learn from this red flag, China's refractory material industry will climb to the world's technological peak and create more new records.

    用革命精神树立高产红旗
    本报评论员
    全国耐火材料高产红旗，在重庆钢铁公司升起来了。他们在今年6月，把过去需要用六十到八十小时烧一窑粘土砖，缩短到九小时四十分。这一个创造使第二耐火材料车间，稍花一些投资，调整一下其他工序的设备，就可以将产量提高三倍，从而基本上解决了炼钢车间产量猛增三倍所需要的耐火砖。现在这面红旗越飘越鲜明，8、9月份，他们的先进窑又创造了七小时十分、六小时二十分的烧成纪录。这样的纪录在世界上也是从来没有过的。
    这面高产红旗所带来的经济意义是很大的。今年我们钢产量要翻一番，铁产量比钢还多得多，这就需要大批的耐火材料。依靠建设新厂解决这个问题，不但需要大量投资，而且时间也来不及。现在重钢出现了耐火材料高产红旗，如果把他们快速烧成的经验推广到全国，不要花很多投资，就可以把现有耐火材料厂的产量提高两倍到三倍。在今后设计上如果采用这个先进技术，就可以把用于耐火材料的投资，减少三分之二。大家可以看出，这是多么大的经济效果。
    但是，应当指明，这面红旗的意义，决不只是在经济上，更重要的是，这是一个重大的技术革命，它的出现推翻了世界公认的、行之多年的技术理论，创立了新的技术理论。过去，人们在烧制粘土砖时，都是受着一个升温曲线的支配。按照这条曲线生产，每一窑粘土砖最快需要三十小时以上，慢一些则需要九十小时以上。为什么不能把窑温迅速升到所需要的温度呢？因为书本上写着如果温度升得快了，砖坯的水分蒸发过快，就会使砖发生龟裂，变成废品。多少年来，烧耐火砖的人，一窑一窑地烧着，都把这个理论奉为“圣旨”，谁也不敢触动它。
    大跃进的形势到来了，重庆钢铁公司的工人们都磨拳擦掌要大干一番。首先炼钢工人要把产量翻三番，这就引起耐火材料车间一番争论。耐火砖怎样跟上去呢？一部分技术人员主张买设备、建厂房，扩大生产。工人说，不行，这样花钱多又来不及，应当从改变升温曲线，缩短烧成时间上去想办法增加产量。技术人员查遍书本，找不到理论根据，反对工人的意见，工人反问技术人员：“难道我们只能永远抱着死规程不能改变？”工人们不管技术人员的反对，在党支部的支持下，大胆地试验起来。在试验过程中，虽然不断遭到一些技术人员的阻挠，但工人们却勇敢地把试验坚持下来。真理是在工人这方面，试验的结果，温度虽然迅速提高，但耐火砖却完好无损，一点也没有影响质量。于是旧的升温曲线破产了，新的升温曲线产生了。
    这看来是一件冒险的事情，其实一点也不冒险。人们掌握生产斗争规律的能力，是随着生产经验的丰富而逐渐提高的。当人们生产斗争经验还不十分丰富时所总结出来的一些技术理论和公式，带有若干片面性也是必然的。在生产实践过程中一些不完整的甚至错误的技术理论被修正，甚至被推翻也是必然的。这是合乎辩证法的。重钢第二耐火材料车间的工人们可贵的地方在于他们是按着辩证法办事，他们不屈服于书本上的公式，敢于根据实践的经验，大胆地推翻旧的，创立新的。工人同志们有丰富的生产经验，过去由于思想解放不够，创造性没有充分发挥出来。现在思想解放了，奇迹出在他们手里，是很自然的。有人或许会奇怪：为什么有一些技术人员要坚决反对工人的创造呢？这也不奇怪。有一些技术人员，他们并不直接参加生产，十分缺乏生产实践的经验，只是凭书本上的公式和教条去指导生产，离开书本，他们就无所作为了，因此他们就想也不敢想书本上的公式是否合理，更谈不到去创造了。问题不在于他们开始反对，重要的是如何从这件事情中吸取教训，放下技术人员的架子深入实践，参加生产，虚心向工人学习，锻炼成一个又红又专的技术人员。
    现在全国钢铁的生产和基本建设正在大跃进，耐火材料供应不足，已经成为一个迫切需要解决的问题。因此全国的耐火材料工业，都应积极学习重钢第二耐火材料车间的经验，一个接一个地插上新的高产红旗。可以相信，只要认真地向这面红旗学习，我国耐火材料工业，将登上世界技术的高峰，创造出更多的新纪录。
