Sports Must Also Create Miracles
——Welcoming the First National Games

In order to celebrate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, to review the achievements of China's sports development, to promote the more widespread development of sports, and to improve the level of sports technology, it has been decided to hold the First National Games next year. This is a major event in the development of China's sports. We sincerely hope that the First National Games will be successfully held and achieve brilliant results after a year of full preparation.

China's industrial, agricultural, cultural, and educational undertakings are developing rapidly, releasing many satellites. China's sports serve production and national defense. Countless examples prove that sports have a great positive effect on production, work, study, military training, and combat. In the new era when China is entering a technical revolution and a cultural revolution, especially when the "people's communes" organized in a unified manner by workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers are being universally established, it is particularly important to carry out sports activities and enhance the people's physique. China's socialist builders and commune members should not only have a high degree of political and ideological awareness, rich scientific and cultural knowledge, and multi-faceted production skills, but also be radiant and full of energy. Those who pick up hoes or tools are excellent laborers, and those who pick up guns are brave and strong soldiers defending the national defense and defending peace. For this reason, sports must make a great leap forward. Combined with the convening of the National Games, we must encourage the people of the whole country, sports enthusiasts, athletes, and laborers across the country to intensify their exercise, and while industry, agriculture, culture and education are launching "satellites," they must also create the best records in sports and release more and more brilliant sports "satellites."

The First National Games will be large in scale, wide in scope, large in number, high in requirements, and long in duration. According to the Organizing Committee of the First National Games, almost all sports that have been developed in China are included in the competition plan; the number of athletes, including those participating in the preliminaries and finals, will be more than 16,000. 12,000 people will be concentrated in Beijing for the finals, plus referees, team leaders, staff, etc., there will still be 16,000 people; athletes participating in the National Games must reach the level of national first-class athletes or above, except for a few newly developed sports; the time will be from September 13 to October 2 next year. In Chinese history, there has never been such a grand sports meeting, and few such grand sports meetings have been held in the world. During the thirty-odd years of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, seven national games were held, the largest of which had only eight events and more than 2,000 people, and the total number of people in the seven games was less than 10,000. The International Olympic Games cannot be compared. Taking the 16th Olympic Games held in 1956 as an example, there were only 16 competition events and only more than 4,000 people. Only nine years after the establishment of the new China, we are preparing to hold such a National Games. This not only shows that China's sports have been rapidly developed and have achieved great results under the care and leadership of the Party and the government; more importantly, it proves the unparalleled superiority of China's socialist system.

The work report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress listed "promoting sports" as one of the contents of the cultural revolution. Holding various sports meetings is one of the effective and important methods of "promoting sports." Holding an unprecedentedly grand National Games certainly has the role of undertaking the political task of "promoting sports." In order to ensure the successful holding of the First National Games, it is necessary to widely carry out mass sports activities, requiring millions of people to receive planned sports training; tens of millions of people to reach the standards of labor and defense systems at all levels; organize thousands of grass-roots sports teams and exercise groups; greatly develop rural sports; greatly run amateur sports schools for young people; strengthen propaganda and mobilization work; and strive to manufacture sports equipment and build sports venues by ourselves. On the basis of widely carrying out mass sports activities, carefully select outstanding athletes, formulate training plans as early as possible, organize them to participate in various competitions, summarize and improve training methods at any time, care about their thoughts, work, and life, strengthen political and ideological education, and cultivate their spirit of bravery, tenacity, hard work, and never stopping breaking records, everyone striving to be upstream, and everyone striving to be first. The athletes participating in this sports meeting should study hard, work hard, be neither arrogant nor discouraged, and strive to fulfill the requirements of the motherland and the people.

To require thousands of people to reach the standards of the labor and defense system, become graded athletes, create excellent records, and break world records, it is necessary to implement the spirit of the general line of socialist construction, put politics in command, liberate the mind, oppose conservatism, break superstitions, and create miracles with soaring energy and the spirit of "one day equals twenty years." We believe that under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses, the difficulties in the work can be overcome and the tasks can be completed. As long as the infinite potential of the broad masses is brought into play, countless miracles will be created. The sports workers of the whole country must attach importance to the convening of the First National Games, take the holding of the National Games as the key link, widely carry out mass sports activities, improve on the basis of popularization, popularize under the guidance of improvement, improve technical level, create world records, comprehensively promote sports work, actively enhance the people's physique, and better serve production and national defense, so as to celebrate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with brilliant sports achievements.

    体育也要创奇迹
    ——迎接第一届全国运动会
    为了庆祝伟大的建国十周年，检阅我国体育运动发展成就，促进体育运动更普遍的发展，提高运动技术水平，已经决定在明年举行第一届全国运动会。这是我国体育运动发展中的大事，我们衷心地希望：第一届全国运动会经过一年的充分准备，将胜利召开，并获得辉煌的成就。
    我国工业、农业、文化教育事业，正在飞速发展，放出了许多卫星。我国体育运动是为生产和国防服务的。无数事例证明体育运动对生产、工作、学习、军事训练和作战都有很大的积极作用。在我国正在进入技术革命、文化革命的新时期，特别是以工、农、商、学、兵统一组织的“人民公社”正在普遍建立的时候，开展体育运动，增强人民体质，具有特别重要的意义。我国社会主义建设者、公社社员，不仅要有高度的政治思想觉悟，丰富的科学文化知识和多方面的生产技能，而且要人人神采焕发，个个精力充沛，拿起锄头或工具是出色的劳动者，拿起枪杆就是英勇的保卫国防、保卫和平的坚强战士。为此，体育运动必须大跃进，结合全国运动会的召开，鼓舞全国人民、全国体育爱好者、运动员和全国劳动者，加紧锻炼，在工业、农业、文化教育事业大放“卫星”的同时，在体育运动方面也创造最优良的纪录，放射出更多、更灿烂的体育“卫星”。
    第一届全国运动会的规模大、项目广、人数多、要求高、时间长。根据第一届全国运动会筹备委员会公布，目前我国已经开展的运动项目，差不多完全列入竞赛规划；运动员人数，以参加预赛、决赛计，将有一万六千多人。集中到北京进行决赛的将有一万二千人，加上裁判员、领队、工作人员等仍将有一万六千人；参加全国运动会的运动员，除少数新开展的项目外必须达到国家一级运动员以上的水平；时间在明年的9月13日到10月2日。我国历史上从来没有举行过这样盛大的运动会，世界上也很少举行这样盛大的运动会。国民党反动派统治的三十几年里，曾经召开过七次全国运动会，其中最大的一次也只有八个项目，二千多人，七次运动会的人数总合还不到一万。国际奥林匹克运动会也不能相比。以1956年举行的十六届奥运会为例，竞赛项目仅有十六个，人数仅有四千多。在新中国建立后仅仅九年，就准备举行这样一次全国运动会，这不仅说明了我国体育运动在党和政府的关怀和领导下得到迅速的发展和取得了巨大成绩；更重要的是证明了我国社会主义社会制度的无比优越。
    中共中央向“八大”二次会议的工作报告中把“提倡体育”列为文化革命的内容之一。举办各种运动会是“提倡体育”的有效的重要方法之一，举行空前盛大的全国运动会当然具有担负“提倡体育”这一政治任务的作用。为了保证胜利地举行第一届全运会，必须广泛开展群众体育运动，要求几百万人能够受到有计划的体育训练；几千万人达到各级劳卫制标准；组织千千万万个基层运动队和锻炼小组；大大发展农村体育；大办青、少年业余体育学校；加强宣传鼓动工作；努力自造体育器材和自建运动场地。在广泛开展群众体育运动的基础上，仔细地选拔优秀运动员，及早制订训练计划，组织他们参加各种竞赛活动，随时总结和改进训练方法，关心他们的思想、工作、生活，加强政治思想教育，培养他们勇敢顽强、艰苦奋斗、不破纪录决不休止、人人争上游、个个争第一的精神。参加这次运动会的运动员们应该勤学苦练，不骄不馁，为完成祖国和人民对自己的要求而奋斗。
    要求千千万万的人达到劳卫制标准，成为等级运动员，创造优良纪录，打破世界纪录，必须贯彻社会主义建设总路线的精神，政治挂帅，解放思想，反对保守，破除迷信，要以冲天的干劲，“一天等于二十年”的精神创造奇迹。我们相信，在各级党委领导之下，发动群众，依靠群众，工作中的困难一定可以克服，任务一定可以完成。广大群众的无穷潜力只要得到发挥，就会创造无数奇迹。全国的体育工作者，必须重视第一届全国运动会的召开，以举行全国运动会为纲，广泛开展群众性体育运动，在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及，提高技术水平，创造世界纪录，全面推进体育工作，积极增强人民体质，更好地为生产、国防服务，以辉煌的体育成就来庆祝伟大的建国十周年。
