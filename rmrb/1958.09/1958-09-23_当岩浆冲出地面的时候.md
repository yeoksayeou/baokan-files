　　When magma rushes out of the ground, people say: A volcano has erupted!

　　What is magma? It is the molten material that, after cooling, can become granite. It can not only generate granite, but also many other kinds of stones. These stones are collectively called igneous rocks or magmatic rocks. They are all produced in blocks and contain a large amount of silica. Apart from this, it can be said that all the elements that make up the earth are present in magma. Due to the great pressure underground, some water vapor and gas are also forced to mix in the magma. They are all constantly waiting for a chance to escape and become an important driving force for pushing the magma out of the ground. However, because the earth's crust is generally very strong, and the magma constantly loses heat during its march towards the surface, it is difficult to move without heat, so it is unable to break through. Finally, it gradually cools underground and becomes rock.

　　However, sometimes magma accumulates enough power underground, and if there happens to be a weak link in the earth's crust there, it can open a passage and rush out, becoming the startling phenomenon of a volcanic eruption. At this time, the earth trembles, making a rumbling sound, and a huge, scorching column of smoke suddenly rises from the ground, filling the sky, immediately obscuring the sun and moon, and changing the colors of the rivers and mountains. At night, the fire illuminates the sky, and sometimes even attracts lightning and torrential rain. On the ground, red-hot lava flows like a river of fire.

　　This kind of eruption not only occurs on those frequently active volcanoes, but also suddenly occurs in unexpected places. Before the eruption of the Paricutin volcano in Mexico, it was a field of crops, and farmers were still farming there when the eruption began. Before 79 AD, the Italian Mount Vesuvius was also considered a quiet valley, with green grape vines covering the hillside, but a sudden volcanic eruption destroyed everything. The large amount of debris and lava erupted by the volcano even buried the cities at the foot of the mountain. Therefore, "imperialism is like sitting on a volcano" is a very appropriate metaphor we are familiar with.

　　Volcanoes erupt a lot of debris. The "smoke column" you see is debris, gas, and water vapor. Some of these debris are as fine as ash, called volcanic ash; some are larger and often spindle-shaped, called volcanic bombs; and some other shapes of debris are called different names. Some of these debris are rocks blocking the volcanic passage, and even boulders weighing dozens of tons are thrown into the sky; others are lava that is ejected into the high sky and condensed. Some of these materials fall down and pile up around the crater, mixed with the lava on the ground, becoming conical peaks; some float in all directions. The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa (this volcano is on a small island in Indonesia) sent volcanic ash to a height of 80,000 meters, traveling around the world. The range of activity of the lava flowing on the ground is much smaller, and it is rare for it to spread for dozens of kilometers, and the amount is also less than the debris. According to volcanologists, since 1500, volcanoes on Earth have erupted a total of about 3,000 cubic kilometers of debris, but only about 50 cubic kilometers of lava.

　　Naturally, lava becomes rock after cooling, and basalt is an important type of it. It is formed on the ground, and the cooling process is faster than granite, so it does not have coarse mineral crystals like granite, but is very fine and more solid than granite. It can withstand a pressure of more than 5,000 kilograms per square centimeter, and is a useful material in construction. Volcanic ash is also very useful in construction. Volcanic ash is the oldest natural cement. The Romans completed many huge projects such as theaters, temples, and bridges, thanks to the use of volcanic ash. It was discovered at that time that volcanic ash can be used as a cementing material. Even today, some people still use volcanic ash and the volcanic tuff formed by its accumulation to replace cement.

　　However, the most noteworthy use of volcanoes is the huge energy they possess. According to calculations by the Soviet geologist Sherbakov, the energy produced by a volcanic eruption in Kamchatka on March 30, 1956, would require the world's largest power station, the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, to work for 3,500 years! It is important to know that there are 522 active and potentially active volcanoes on Earth. What a huge wealth it would be if they could be utilized!

    当岩浆冲出地面的时候
    石工
    当岩浆冲出地面的时候，人们说：火山喷发了！
    什么是岩浆呢？就是那种在冷却后能够成为花岗岩的熔融物质。它不仅能生成花岗岩，还可以生成别的许多种石头，这些石头总起来叫火成岩或岩浆岩。它们都是成块地产出，含有大量的二氧化矽。除此以外，可以说组成地球的一切元素在岩浆中都有。由于地下的压力很大，一些水汽、气体也被迫混在岩浆里，它们都时刻等待着逃跑的机会，成为推动岩浆冲出地面的重要动力，但是由于地壳一般很结实，而岩浆在向地面进军的过程中，不断散失着热，没有热它就很难活动，以致无力冲出，终于在地下逐渐冷却，成为岩石。
    可是，有时岩浆在地下蓄积了足够的力量，那里正好是地壳的薄弱环节，便能打开一条通道，冲了出来，成为触目惊心的火山喷发现象。这时大地震动，发出了隆隆的响声，巨大的炽热的烟柱突然从地下升起，弥漫天空，顿时日月无光，河山变色，入夜则火光烛天，有时还招来雷电、暴雨；在地上，赤热的熔岩像火河一般在流动。
    这种爆发不仅发生在那些经常活动的火山上，也会突然发生在意想不到的地方。墨西哥帕里库丁火山在喷发前原是一片庄稼地，开始喷发时还有农民在那里耕种。意大利维苏威火山在公元79年以前，也被认为是宁静的山谷，绿色的葡萄藤爬满了山坡，可是突然的火山爆发毁灭了这一切。火山喷出的大量碎屑物质和熔岩甚至埋葬了山下的城市。因此，“帝国主义像坐在火山口上”是我们所熟悉的非常恰当的譬喻。
    火山喷出的碎屑物质是很多的，你所看见的“烟柱”，就是碎屑物质、气体和水汽。这些碎屑物质有的像细灰一样，叫做火山灰；有些较粗大的，常成纺锤形，叫做火山弹；还有些其他形状的碎屑分别叫不同的名字。这些碎屑物质有的是堵塞火山通道的岩石，甚至几十吨重的巨石也被抛向天空；还有些则是喷到高空的熔岩冷凝而成，这些物质有的落下来堆在火山口的四周，和地上的熔岩夹杂在一起，成为锥形的山峰；有的则飘向四方。1883年克拉卡托火山喷发（这个火山在印度尼西亚的一个小岛上），火山灰喷上了八万公尺的高空，周游了全世界。在地上流动的熔岩的活动范围就要小得多了，能够流布几十公里长已很少有，数量也比碎屑物质少。据火山学家计算，自1500年以来，地球上的火山一共喷出了约三千立方公里的碎屑物质，可是熔岩只有大约五十立方公里。
    熔岩冷却后自然是成为岩石，玄武岩就是其中重要的一种。它是在地面生成的，冷却的过程比花岗岩快，所以不像花岗岩那样有较粗的矿物结晶体，而是很细，比花岗岩更为结实。每平方厘米面积上，可以经得起五千公斤以上的压力，是建筑中有用的材料。火山灰在建筑中也很有用，火山灰是最古老的天然水泥，罗马人完成了剧场、神庙、大桥等许多巨大的工程，就得力于对火山灰的利用。那时就发现火山灰可作胶合材料。直到今天还有人用火山灰和它堆积而成的火山凝灰岩来代替水泥。
    不过对火山的利用最值得注意的还是火山拥有的巨大的能。据苏联地质学家谢尔巴科夫计算，1956年3月30日在堪察加，一次火山爆发所产生的能，需要世界上最大的发电站古比雪夫水电站工作三千五百年！要知道地球上还有五百二十二座正在活动和可以活动的火山，如果利用起来是多么巨大的财富！
