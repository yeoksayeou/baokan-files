Studying Deep Plowing from the Perspective of Soil Science
Xiong Yi, Leader of the Soil Survey Team, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Deep plowing of land is a traditional farming method in our country, but it is only today, under the leadership of the Party, that it can be widely developed and become a mass movement. What changes will occur in the soil after deep plowing? How should these changes be analyzed? Are these changes good or bad? Are there any patterns? These questions need to be clarified from the perspective of soil science.

Deep plowing is a great transformation of the land, a major reform of the soil. Whether from a horizontal or vertical perspective, the soil undergoes tremendous changes. A nationwide deep plowing movement is about to take shape. This great man-made measure will change the face of the soil. In the future, we will not only judge the distribution and changes of soil from the natural environment, but more importantly, we must study the changes in soil caused by the power of the great working people. Therefore, we must not only use natural dialectics but also historical materialism to study soil. The information on deep plowing methods and other soil improvement measures taken by a province, county, or township will be a very important basis for our research. After going to Changge County, Henan Province, to summarize deep plowing experiences, and then participating in the National Land Deep Plowing Conference, I saw the effect of deep plowing on agricultural production increase in a short period of one month. At the same time, I felt that soil science was not keeping up with the development of production, and the thinking of soil science workers was not keeping up with the demands of the masses.

After this stage of work, I have gained some new understanding of soil science. These understandings are not systematic or complete enough, so I am writing them down for your reference.

What is Soil

Soil evolves from soil parent material. It is relatively loose, contains organic matter, has biological activity, and has fertility, that is, it has water and fertilizer and can serve agricultural production. Soil must have fertility; fertility is the essential characteristic of soil. The correct concept of soil is loose material on the Earth's surface that can timely supply crops with water and nutrients. This point of view seems simple, but it is very ideological. It illustrates the close connection between soil and agricultural production. This kind of soil concept does not exist in capitalist countries, and it is the correct understanding of soil in socialist countries. Today, under the glorious light of the General Line, we have a further understanding of soil. Soil not only includes fertility but also has the significance of continuously improving fertility. It is not only the natural forces that have created soil fertility, but the human factor increases soil fertility beyond the power of nature. It is a revolutionary understanding to improve the efficiency of soil's supply of water and fertilizer through human power.

With the concept of soil, we can further understand what is dead soil, live soil, and oil soil. These three terms were created by the masses of farmers. The masses of farmers do not have a complete and consistent understanding of dead soil, live soil, and oil soil. For example, Comrade Ma Tongyi, the Party Secretary of Shengli Cooperative in Changge County, and Captain Ma of the second production team of the cooperative have different views on live soil. Ma Tongyi has higher requirements for live soil and oil soil, while Captain Ma believes that the soil after deep plowing can be live soil. There is not enough information to scientifically classify and affirm these terms. I can only use my superficial views to make a preliminary division:

Dead soil: Some people call it raw soil, or it can be said to be soil parent material or inactive soil, which is a soil layer that has no production significance. But dead soil can be turned into live soil.

Live soil: Belongs to the scope of soil, has fertility, can grow crops, and can supply crops with water.

Oil soil: Also known as ripe soil, it is very fertile soil with more organic matter, which can fully supply crops with water and fertilizer. Its physical, chemical, and biological characteristics all show a high degree of fertility, and high yields can be obtained.

To achieve high yields, live soil alone is not enough. We must turn dead soil into live soil, and live soil into oil soil.

The Evolution of Soil

From the perspective of agricultural production, dead soil can be turned into live soil, which is completely consistent with theoretical understanding. Soil is not static, but moving, changing, and developing; soil is not isolated, but is interconnected and mutually restricted by the natural environment and human factors. The development of soil is staged, and it can develop in a good direction or a bad direction. The natural environment and human factors can control the development of soil. But as far as the current situation in our country is concerned, human factors have unparalleled power to change the soil.

If we want to promote the development of soil in a good direction, we must analyze the advantages and disadvantages of soil at the present stage, and we must also understand its past situation, the process of development to today, and infer its future changes and development. Not only that, but we must also trace the causes and laws of this series of changes (including natural and human factors). Only by grasping these causes and laws can we have a basis to revolutionize and transform the soil. For example, knowing that the formation of saline soil is due to the excessively high groundwater level with high mineralization, we can use drainage and salt leaching methods to transform it. We know that the soil in the Fuyang area is both afraid of drought and waterlogging, so we have the confidence to control it with river networkization.

Deep plowing can turn dead soil into live soil, but it cannot turn live soil into oil soil. To turn live soil into oil soil, it must be gardenized to increase the organic matter and nutrients in the soil. Conversely, oil soil can become dead soil after being tightly buried. For example, the black soil layer buried under the loess in Northwest China looks very fertile, but analysis shows that the organic matter is not high, there is little fulvic acid, and humic acid is also carbonized. After live soil becomes a plow pan or compacted layer, the porosity decreases, the water storage capacity decreases, and it becomes dead soil again. Therefore, deep plowing is the driving force to guide the soil to develop in a good direction, and it is a basic measure for increasing agricultural production. After deep plowing to turn dead soil into live soil, it can gradually evolve into a more fertile state, so that agricultural production can be increased again and again. The effect of deep plowing is consistent for both dry land and paddy fields. Deep plowing is a way to transform the soil in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and it is one of the conditions for high yields.

Analyzing deep plowing from the perspective of production has the following benefits:

1. Deep plowing fundamentally changes the characteristics of the soil, that is, it turns dead soil into live soil, so that the soil has the ability to supply crops with water and fertilizer, and improves the productivity of the soil. In terms of physical properties, deep plowing thickens the loose layer, the pores are appropriate, and the water, air, and temperature are well regulated, which is conducive to the development of crop roots and strengthens wind resistance, which can prevent lodging. For example, in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, the rice roots of paddy fields deep-plowed to two feet deep can reach two feet deep. This example provides a powerful criticism of the view that rice roots are only distributed in the surface soil layer. Deep plowing cannot be said to increase the granular structure, because the granular structure is not formed casually, and it requires many conditions (Editor's note: Scientists' understanding is not consistent, and this issue needs to be further studied). In terms of chemical properties, deep plowing cannot directly increase organic matter and nitrogen, but it can cause the weathering of soil minerals and release phosphorus and potassium nutrients. The soil phosphorus fixed by lime and iron is difficult for crops to use. After deep plowing, the soil undergoes weathering, which can release a part of the effective phosphorus. The original organisms in the soil, such as feldspar, mica, and secondary mineral vermiculite, all contain some potassium, and after deep plowing, strengthening the weathering of the soil can also release a part of the potassium. When the physical and chemical properties are good, biological activity will naturally be more vigorous.

2. Deep plowing drives the development of other good soil properties, mainly water and fertilizer retention. We know that deep plowing itself cannot produce water and fertilizer, but it can make water and fertilizer stored more and better. Deep plowing thickens the loose layer, which can accommodate more rain, snow, and fertilizer, so the soil itself plays the role of water storage, and reduces the loss of rainfall runoff. Deep plowing weakens the capillary action of the soil and reduces the loss of water evaporation. Deep plowing combined with layered fertilization enables a large amount of fertilizer to be evenly distributed in the loosened soil layer and reduces the loss of fertilizer. Water and fertilizer are spread throughout the soil layer, and water, soil, and fertilizer are integrated, and the role of water and fertilizer can be fully utilized.

3. Deep plowing promotes the effectiveness of other measures. At the same time as deep plowing, the purpose of leveling the land is also achieved. Deep plowing increases the water storage capacity and permeability of the soil, thus strengthening the salt washing effect of saline soil. Deep plowing is best carried out after the surface water has been drained, so in order to achieve deep plowing to promote paddy field drainage, it can both be sun-dried and overcome the harm of cold soaking. Deep plowing red soil can promote the soil ripening process. Deep plowing sandy and gravelly soil and iron pan red soil can detect sandy gravel and iron pan, so deep plowing can improve some of the bad properties of the soil. Deep plowing plays a certain role in eliminating weeds, pathogens, and oxidizing toxic substances in the soil.

Deep plowing is good, but it is only a basic measure, not the only measure. Today, we have raised deep plowing to a certain height, but irrigation, fertilization, seeds, dense planting and other aspects are also important conditions for high yields, and must be followed up. The North China Six Provinces and Cities Coordination Conference proposed gardenization, which is an important issue in agricultural production increase measures. Deep plowing can only turn dead soil into live soil; to turn live soil into oil soil, it depends on gardenization. Only gardenization can better ripen the soil, increase soil organic matter, increase the soil's absorption capacity, and further improve the soil's physical and chemical properties. And further strengthen the ability to retain water and fertilizer. Only after the live soil becomes oil soil can the harvest be guaranteed. The 7,320 jin high-yield wheat field in Xiping County, Henan Province, is a vegetable garden that has been cultivated for more than 100 years. It has been deep-plowed in the past, deep-plowed four times this year, and applied 120,000 jin of base fertilizer, 50,000 jin of mixed fertilizer, and 36,000 jin of human manure. From this, it can be seen that the gardenization proposed by the North China Coordination Conference is very correct. Deep plowing followed by gardenization to turn live soil into oil soil is in line with the law of soil development.

Deep plowing is a method that can be adopted for general soil. Except for very few cases, it is generally beneficial without harm. Therefore, it should be rapidly and universally carried out throughout the country. In order to better carry out this work, agricultural machinery workers bear a major task. It is hoped that the following points will be considered when designing and creating deep plowing agricultural tools: (1) Deep plowing agricultural tools can plow the soil in layers, and the upper and lower soil layers are not disordered; (2) The plowing is deep, the pulling force is light, and the lower soil is easy to emerge; (3) Fertilization can be combined during plowing so that soil and fertilizer are integrated; (4) When plowing ditches, dead soil and live soil can be plowed up separately without mixing.

At the same time, we must scientifically summarize the experience of the masses of farmers, find the laws, and let the soil develop in the direction we require. In addition to understanding how deep plowing and gardenization guide the soil to develop in the direction of live soil and oil soil, it is also necessary to understand under what circumstances live soil and oil soil develop in the opposite direction. We have clarified the law of soil development. Under the leadership of the Party and with the enthusiastic creation of millions of working people, we will definitely be able to guide the soil to develop in a good direction.

New Understanding of Soil Improvement

Narrowly speaking, soil improvement refers to the improvement of diseased, unproductive, or low-productivity soils, such as saline-alkali soil improvement, wind and sand improvement, low-lying land improvement, and red soil improvement. Today, under the glorious light of the General Line, the scope of soil improvement has been expanded. We must not only improve bad soil into good soil, but also improve general soil into high-yield fields. Chairman Mao put forward the close combination of water, fertilizer, and soil, which shows that the requirements for us are higher. We must not only improve saline-alkali soil and wind and sand, but also improve general cultivated land, and even high-yield fields, to make them more and more productive.

Deep plowing is a kind of cultivation measure, which can change the physical and chemical properties of the soil. Therefore, it also has the significance of soil improvement. Only under the glorious light of the General Line can we emancipate our minds and open up an infinitely broad future for soil improvement. The General Line requires us to go all out, aim high, and build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. From the perspective of soil improvement, it has two important meanings: (1) We must use human power and communist spirit to improve the soil; (2) Soil improvement is endless, there are no fixed specifications, and soil improvement again and again, and agricultural production again and again, are our indicators.

    从土壤科学来研究深翻问题
    中国科学院土壤考察队队长　熊毅
    土地深翻是我国固有的一种耕作法，但只有今天在党的领导下才能得到广泛的发展，成为群众性的运动。深翻后土壤会发生那些变化？如何分析这些变化？这些变化是好还是坏？是不是具有规律性？这些问题都需要从土壤科学上来予以阐明。
    深翻是土地的大翻身，是土壤的大改革，无论是从平面或垂直方向来说，土壤都发生了极大的变化。目前即将形成一个全民性的深翻地运动，这个伟大的人为措施将使土壤的面貌改观。今后我们不单从自然环境来判断土壤的分布和变化，更重要的是要研究伟大的劳动人民的力量所引起的土壤变化。因此，我们不仅要用自然辩证法，还要采用历史唯物辩证法，来研究土壤。对一个省一个县或乡社所采取的深翻方法以及其他改良土壤的措施的一些资料，将是我们研究土壤的极重要的根据。这次去河南长葛县总结深翻经验以后，又参加全国土地深翻会议，短短一个月的时间，看到了深翻对农业增产的效果，同时也感觉到土壤科学赶不上生产的发展，土壤科学工作者思想跟不上群众的要求。
    经过这一阶段的工作，使我对土壤科学有了些新的认识，这些认识还不够系统不够完整，写出来供大家参考。
    什么是土壤
    土壤是土壤母质演变来的，比较疏松，有有机质，有生物的活动，有肥力，也就是有水有肥能为农业生产服务。土壤必须具有肥力，肥力是土壤的本质特征。土壤的正确概念就是地球表面能及时供应农作物以水分和养料的疏松物质。这个论点看来很简单，但有很大的思想性，它说明了土壤和农业生产的紧密联系，这样的土壤概念是资本主义国家所没有的，是社会主义国家对土壤的正确认识。今天在总路线光辉照耀下，对土壤更有了进一步的认识，土壤不仅包括肥力，更有不断提高肥力的意义。这不仅是自然力量发生了土壤的肥力，人为因素增加土壤的肥力超过自然的力量。用人为力量来提高土壤对水肥的供应效率，这是一种革命的认识。
    有了土壤的概念，就可以进一步来认识什么是死土、活土及油土。这三个名词是农民群众创造的。农民群众对死土、活土、油土也没有一个完整一致的认识。比如长葛县胜利一社党支书马同义同志与该社第二生产队的马队长对活土的看法就不一致，马同义对活土油土的要求更高一些，而马队长却认为深翻后的土壤就可以是活土。现在还没有足够的资料来科学地进行分类，把这个名词肯定下来，只能用我粗浅的看法来作初步的划分：
    死土：有人称生土，也可以说是土壤母质或者是不活跃的土壤，是不具生产意义的土层。但死土可以变为活土。
    活土：属于土壤的范围，具有肥力，能生长作物，能供应作物水分。
    油土：又称熟土，是很肥沃的土壤，有机质较多，能充分供应作物以水分和肥分，其理化生物特性都表现了高度的肥力，可以获得高额的丰产。
    要想丰产光是活土还不够，必须把死土变活土，活土变油土。
    土壤的演变
    从农业生产上说来，死土可以变活，这一点和理论上的认识是完全一致的。土壤不是静止的，而是运动变化和发展的；土壤不是孤立的，而是和自然环境、人为因素相互联系相互制约的。土壤的发展是具有阶段性的，可以向好的方向发展，也可以向坏的方向发展。自然环境和人为因素都可以支配土壤的发展。但就我国今天的情况说来，人为因素对土壤的改变更是具有无比的威力。
    我们要促进土壤向好的方向发展，就必须分析在现阶段土壤的优缺点，而且还要了解它过去的情况，发展到今天的过程，推论它将来的变化和发展。不仅如此，还要追索这一系列变化的原因与规律（包括自然的和人为的因素）。掌握了这些原因和规律，我们才有根据去革命地改造土壤。比如，了解盐土的形成是由于高矿化度的地下水位过高，我们便可采用排水洗盐的方法去改造它。我们了解了阜阳地区的土壤又怕旱又怕涝，便有信心用河网化来治理它。
    深翻可以使死土变为活土，但不能使活土变为油土。要使活土变油土，一定要园田化，增加土壤的有机质和养料。相反的，油土经过紧密地埋藏，又可成为死土。比如西北黄土下面埋藏的黑色土层，看上去好像很肥沃，但经分析有机质并不高，富啡酸少，胡敏酸也碳化。活土变成犁底层或垫足层后，空隙度减低，蓄水量减少，又成了死土。因此，深翻是引导土壤向良好方向发展的动力，是农业增产的一项基本措施，经过深翻把死土变成活土，才能逐步演变到更肥沃的地步，使农业丰产再丰产。深翻的作用，无论旱地水田都是一致的，深翻是多快好省地改造土壤的办法，是丰产的条件之一。
    从生产的角度分析深翻，有以下的好处：
    1、深翻基本改变了土壤的特性，也就是使死土变为活土，使土壤具有供应作物以水肥的能力，提高了土壤的生产力。在物理性质方面，深翻使土壤疏松层加厚，空隙适当，水分、空气、温度因此都得到了良好的调节，有利于作物根系的发育，抗风力加强，可防止倒伏。如江苏盐城县水田深耕二尺，稻根下扎就达二尺。这个实例给认为稻根只分布在表土层的看法以强有力的批判。深翻不能说增加了团粒结构，因为团粒结构不是随便就形成的，它需要很多的条件（编者注：科学家的认识还不一致，此问题尚待继续研究）。在化学性质方面，深翻不能直接增加有机质和氮素，但能引起土壤矿物质风化，而释放出磷钾养料，石灰和铁所固定的土壤磷素作物很难利用深翻后土壤经过风化，可释放出一部分有效的磷素。土壤中的原生物如长石、云母和次生矿物的云泰，都含有一些钾素，深翻后，加强土壤的风化，也可释放出一部分钾素出来。理化性质好了，生物活动自然也就更加旺盛。
    2、深翻带动了其他良好土壤性质的发展，主要是蓄水保水和蓄肥保肥。我们知道：深翻本身不能产生水肥，但可使水肥保蓄得更多更好。深翻加厚了疏松层，能容纳更多的雨雪和肥分，因此土壤本身就起到了蓄水的作用，而减少降雨径流的损失。深翻削弱了土壤的毛管的作用，减少了水分的蒸发损失。深翻结合分层施肥，使大量的肥料能均匀的分布在松土层内，减少了肥料的损失。水肥遍布在土层中，水土肥得以相融，并能充分发挥水、肥的作用。
    3、深翻促进了其他措施的效益。在深翻的同时，也达到了平整土地的目的。深翻增加了土壤的蓄水量和透水性，因此加强了盐土的洗盐效果。深翻要在地面水分排干后才好进行，因此，为了达到深翻促进水田排干，既可晒垡，又可克服冷浸之害。深翻红壤可以促进土壤熟化过程，深翻砂礓土和铁盘红壤可检出砂礓和铁盘，因此深翻可以改良土壤的一些不良性状。深翻对消灭杂草、病菌害和氧化土壤中的有毒物质都起到了一定的作用。
    深翻虽好，但只是一种基本的措施，而不是唯一的措施。今天我们将深翻提到了一定的高度，但灌溉、施肥、种子、密植等其他方面也都是丰产的重要条件，必须跟上去。华北六省市协作会议，曾提出园田化，这是农业增产措施的一个重要问题。深翻只能把死土变为活土；活土变油土，要靠园田化。只有园田化才能更好的熟化土壤，增加土壤有机质，加大土壤的吸收容量，使土壤理化性质进一步得到改善。而更进一步的加强保蓄水、肥的能力，只有活土变为油土后，丰收才有了保证。河南西平县七千三百二十斤的高额小麦丰产田就是一百多年的菜园地，过去一直深翻，今年深翻了四次，施底肥十二万斤，追杂肥五万斤、三万六千斤人粪尿。由此可以看出，华北协作会议提出园田化是十分正确的，深翻后再跟上园田化，使活土变为油土，这是符合土壤发展规律的。
    深翻是一般土壤都可采用的办法，除了极个别外，一般都是有利无患的。因此，应该迅速在全国普遍开展。为了更好的开展这项工作，农业机械工作者担负有重大的任务，希望在设计和创制深翻农具时考虑下列几点：（1）深翻农具能分层翻土，上下土层不乱；（2）翻的深，拉力又轻，下土出土都容易；（3）翻时能结合施肥，以便土肥相融；（4）沟翻时能把死土和活土分别翻上来，互不相混。
    同时我们要科学地总结农民群众经验，寻找规律，让土壤按照我们所要求的方向发展。除开了解深翻和园田化如何引导土壤向活土和油土方向发展之外，还有必要了解活土和油土在怎样情况下向相反的方向发展。我们明确了土壤的发展规律，在党的领导下及千百万劳动群众的热情创造下，我们一定能引导土壤向好的方向发展。
    对土壤改良的新认识
    狭隘的说土壤改良是指有病的不生产或生产力很低的土壤的改良，如盐碱土改良、风沙改良、洼地改良和红壤改良等。今天在总路线的光辉照耀下，土壤改良的范畴扩大了，不仅要把坏土改良为好土，而且要把一般土壤改良为丰产田。毛主席提出了水肥土的紧密结合，这说明对我们的要求更高了。我们不仅要改良盐碱土，改良风沙，对一般耕地，甚至丰产田也要改良，使之丰产再丰产。
    深翻是一种耕作措施，它能使土壤的理化性质变化。因此也就具有土壤改良的意义。只有在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们才能解放思想，为土壤改良开辟了无限宽广的前途。总路线要我们鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，从土壤改良看来具有两点重要意义：（1）我们要用人的力量，用共产主义的气魄来改良土壤；（2）土壤改良是无止境的，没有固定的规格，土壤改良再改良，农业丰产再丰产就是我们的指标。
