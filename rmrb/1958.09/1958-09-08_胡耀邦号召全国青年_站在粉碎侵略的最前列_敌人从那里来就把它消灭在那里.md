    Hu Yaobang Calls on the Nation's Youth
　　Standing at the Forefront of Crushing Aggression
    Eliminating the Enemy Wherever They Come From
　　Comrades, young comrades!
    The American aggressors are once again baring their fangs and brandishing their claws at our country's doorstep, provoking us. It seems that this unreasonable and overbearing big bully is determined to be an enemy of the Chinese people to the end. We should resolutely mobilize and support Premier Zhou's statement with practical actions. Our Party and Chairman Mao hope that we, the youth, will be active builders and heroic defenders of the motherland, and staunch fighters for world peace and progressive causes. We must answer our beloved Party and beloved leader in this way: We will definitely contribute all our strength to the great cause of liberating Taiwan. If even one inch of the sacred territory of the motherland remains unliberated, it will be our utter shame, and our struggle will not cease.
    In order to thoroughly crush the provocations of the American aggressors, we must resolutely respond to the Party's call, use even greater effort to increase steel production and increase grain production, and strive to accelerate the speed of socialist construction and enhance the power of the motherland.
    In order to thoroughly crush the aggressors' provocations, we must resolutely respond to the Party's call and strive to realize organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization. We should prepare in this way: If the American war maniacs dare to obstruct us from liberating the coastal islands and liberating Taiwan, dare to impose war on us, we can, like our revolutionary elders and like the People's Liberation Army, eliminate the enemy cleanly wherever they come from.
    Comrades, all the ideas and practices of the American aggressors to bully and attempt to frighten us have long been ineffective and have completely gone bankrupt. We all clearly remember that nine years ago, they once ran rampant on the Chinese mainland, but in the face of the powerful Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, they had to tuck their tails and run away. A few years ago, on the Korean battlefield, they also clamored aggressively to cross the Yalu River, but in the face of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, they had to tuck their tails and turn around and run away again. The principle is very simple, that is, we are people who have already stood up, and people who have stood up will never be intimidated. This is because our cause is a just cause, and the just cause is supported by thousands upon thousands of people all over the world.
    For the sake of our just cause, we, the youth, must stand at the forefront of the struggle.
    Victory will surely belong to us!

    胡耀邦号召全国青年
　　站在粉碎侵略的最前列
    敌人从那里来就把它消灭在那里
　　同志们，青年同志们！
    美国侵略者又在我们祖国的大门口张牙舞爪，向我们挑衅了。看来，这个毫不讲理横行霸道的大恶霸，硬要同我国人民为敌到底。我们应该坚决动员起来，用实际行动拥护周总理的声明。我们的党和毛主席希望我们青年，作祖国的积极建设者和英勇保卫者，作世界和平和进步事业的坚强战士。我们要这样来回答我们亲爱的党和亲爱的领袖：我们一定把自己的一切力量贡献给解放台湾的伟大事业。祖国的神圣领土那一天还有一寸没有解放，就是我们的奇耻大辱，我们的斗争就不休止。
    为了彻底粉碎美国侵略者的挑衅，我们要坚决响应党的号召，用更大的干劲，增产钢铁，增产粮食，为加快社会主义建设的速度，增强祖国的威力而斗争。
    为了彻底粉碎侵略者的挑衅，我们要坚决响应党的号召，努力实现组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化。我们应该这样准备：如果美国战争疯子胆敢阻挠我们解放沿海岛屿，解放台湾，胆敢把战争强加于我们，我们就可以像革命长辈那样，像人民解放军那样，敌人从那里来，我们就把它干干净净地消灭在那里。
    同志们，美国侵略者要欺负和企图吓唬我们的一切想法和作法，早已不起作用了，早已完全破产了。我们都清楚记得，九年前，它曾在中国大陆上横行过一时，但是在强大的中国人民和人民解放军面前，只好夹起尾巴跑掉了。几年前，在朝鲜战场上，它又曾经气势汹汹地叫嚷要打过鸭绿江来，但是在朝鲜人民和中国志愿军面前，又只好夹起尾巴掉头往回跑掉了。这个道理很简单，这就是我们是已经站立起来的人民，站起来了的人民是永远吓不倒的，这就是我们的事业是正义的事业，正义的事业是有全世界千千万万人民支持的。
    为了我们的正义事业，我们青年一定要站到斗争的最前列。
    胜利必定属于我们！
