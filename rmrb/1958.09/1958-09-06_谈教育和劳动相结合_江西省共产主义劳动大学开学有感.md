　　On Combining Education and Labor
　　——Impressions from the Opening of Jiangxi Communist Labor University
　　Liu Junxiu, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

　　On August 1st, Army Day, the Jiangxi Communist Labor University’s main campus and thirty branch campuses held opening ceremonies simultaneously in various mountain reclamation farms throughout the province, marking the birth of a new type of proletarian university!

　　Under what historical conditions was the Communist Labor University established? In the winter of 1957, Jiangxi, like other parts of the country, launched a high tide of winter agricultural production and rectification of government organs based on the struggles of rectification and anti-rightist movements. Nearly 50,000 cadres voluntarily signed up to go to the mountains and the countryside. Over one hundred and fourteen comprehensive socialist agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishing reclamation farms were established in more than ten mountainous areas, including Jinggang Mountain. The Communist Labor University was established in these mountainous reclamation farms. At the start of its establishment, it had no spacious school buildings or perfect equipment; some were even thatched huts, exposed to the elements. However, our Communist Labor University follows Chairman Mao's instructions to "intellectualize workers and peasants, and worker-peasantize intellectuals," and has established the teaching policy of "combining diligence and frugality, combining part-time work and part-time study, combining production and learning, combining theory and practice, and combining politics and professional skills." It aims to cultivate and train large numbers of "both civil and military," "both red and expert" talents with a communist spirit in the wilderness.

　　On August 1st, as the president of the Jiangxi Communist Labor University, I attended the opening ceremony of the main campus. At this opening ceremony, many young men and women from worker and peasant backgrounds, with radiant spirits, stepped into the threshold of the university. Many of them were cadres and members of agricultural cooperatives who had just put down their hoes, some were workers from factories, and many were young students from both this province and other provinces who had been admitted to the Communist Labor University. Seeing these new, truly proletarian college students, I had many feelings and memories.

　　I am the son of a poor peasant. When I was twelve years old, I studied for forty-five days in the winter school. At that time, some well-meaning relatives and friends, seeing that I had a strong memory, wanted to use the clan's school land to send me to study. However, children from poor families could not afford to delay their work. My family needed me to work, and even this small hope was shattered. Hunger and poverty deprived me of the opportunity to study. In my childhood and youth, I had to shoulder the burden of life, working as a shepherd, a cook in a lumber mill, carrying coal, and working as a long-term laborer for landlords. To resist the oppression, exploitation, and contempt of the landlords, after the age of nineteen, I rented five or six mu of land to cultivate while going out to carry wood and raft timber, living a poor life of working from dawn till dusk without enough to eat.

　　It was the Communist Party that saved me, it was the revolution that saved me. It not only freed me from hunger and poverty but also cared for and nurtured me in every way, making me a red fighter in the revolutionary ranks. Without the leadership of the Party and without participating in the revolution, I would have remained poor for life, been illiterate forever, and fallen into the abyss of ignorance.

　　When I was twenty-three years old in 1927, I joined the Communist Party. Since then, in the revolutionary ranks, I have always been cared for and nurtured by the Party. In the second year of my participation in the revolution, the Party sent me to a secret training class organized by the Yongxin County Party Committee to study. I remember that the main courses at that time were: "A Brief Explanation of Marxism," "Lenin on the Three Basic Contradictions of Imperialism," "Mobilizing the Masses, Overthrowing Local Tyrants, Distributing Land, Protecting the Poor, and Continuing the Revolutionary Struggle." The Party was my first teacher. At that time, my deepest understanding was that a Communist Party member must be loyal, brave, and unafraid of death, work hard, obey the organization, abide by discipline, strictly keep secrets, sacrifice oneself, and never betray the Party. Although I made up my mind to make revolution during this study, I still did not understand the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, nor had I established a communist world outlook. After this study, after more than six years of practical work, in the winter of 1933, I was elected by the people of the Xianggan Border Soviet Area to participate in the Second National Soviet Congress. The Xianggan Provincial Party Committee and Secretary Ren Bishi personally recommended that I go to the red capital - Ruijin County, to study in the advanced class of the Central Marxist Communist University. The content of the study included: "World Revolutionary History," "Political Common Sense," "The Communist Manifesto," "Basic Theories of Marxism-Leninism," "Party Building," "Basic Issues of the Chinese Revolution," and "Guerrilla Warfare." A hired worker who had been trampled on actually became a representative of the people of the whole country, and then was able to enter the advanced class of the Marxist Communist University to become a college student. At that time, how excited I was!

　　During my study in the Central Soviet Area, because the Kuomintang reactionaries carried out five "encirclement and suppression" campaigns against the Central Soviet Area, implementing a policy of burning, killing, and looting against the people of the Soviet Area, our material life was very difficult. At the beginning, each person had twenty taels of rice per day, which was later reduced to twelve taels, five taels of dry rice for each of the two meals, and two taels of porridge. There was no oil to eat, no salt to eat, only nitrate salt, which damaged our teeth. The only vegetables were old Malan vegetables and old water spinach. We were not full from the rice, and the vegetables were not good, so we had to struggle hard to resolutely eliminate the enemy. However, I was still attracted by this new learning environment, greedily reading the few roughly printed Marxist-Leninist books as if they were treasures. After this study, it laid the foundation for my communist world outlook and strengthened my revolutionary confidence and will.

　　After graduating in July 1934, the Central Committee sent me to work in Xianggan with Comrade Zhang Yunyi to meet with the Sixth Army Group in Guidong, Hunan. Because the Kuomintang reactionary army occupied the Xianggan Soviet Area, we could not return to Xianggan. From then on, I stayed in the Sixth Army Group and participated in the Long March of 25,000 li. By March 1937, after the Western Route Army failed in Qinghai, I led a guerrilla group, persisted in nighttime guerrilla activities for three months, passing through five provinces - Qinghai, Gansu, Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Shaanxi, traveling more than 6,000 li, and successfully returned to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in early June of the same year, through enemy encirclements and blockades. The Party Central Committee then sent me to study at the Central Party School in Qiaergou, Yan'an. After graduating from the Party School in January 1938, the Central Committee assigned me to work in Jinxi North. I returned to Yan'an for medical treatment in December 1940, and in February 1942, I entered the Central Party School again. At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong personally served as the president of the Party School, and I was honored to become Chairman Mao's student again. In this school where theory and practice were closely integrated, I carefully studied the Party's line, studied the Party's history, and further improved my political and ideological level. The Party's continuous cultivation and education of me has transformed me from an ordinary peasant and an illiterate into a cadre with a certain level of culture and theoretical understanding. In the past thirty years, the reason why I have been able to do some work for the revolution is inseparable from the Party and Chairman Mao's cultivation and education of me. The Party's kindness is deeply engraved in my heart and unforgettable for life. My personal experience fully confirms the importance and correctness of the Party's combination of theory and practice in cultivating worker-peasant cadres. Therefore, at the opening ceremony of the Jiangxi Communist Labor University, I earnestly told these students: The Communist Labor University requires students to take up two weapons - the pen and production tools - under the leadership of the Party, using their wisdom and strength, to study and produce at the same time. At present, many people do not understand our school-running policy, and even have misconceptions, doubts, and do not believe that we can cultivate socialist-communist construction talents who combine production and learning, combine professional skills and politics, combine theory and practice, combine mental and physical labor, and are both red and expert. In fact, only by working and studying at the same time can we truly combine professional skills and politics, combine theory and practice, combine mental and physical labor, intellectualize workers and peasants, and worker-peasantize intellectuals; only then can we cultivate comprehensive talents who have both revolutionary theory and labor production technology and scientific knowledge. Marxism-Leninism also tells us that only labor can create wealth, only labor can transform the world, only labor can transform nature, and only labor can build a happy and fulfilling socialist-communist society.

　　The Communist Labor University, with the addition of the two words "Communist" and "Labor," is precisely the main symbol of our new type of university, and this is also the fundamental difference between us and any bourgeois university in the past. Bourgeois universities cultivate intellectuals to serve the bourgeoisie according to the will of the bourgeoisie, in order to consolidate the rule of the bourgeoisie, the capitalist exploitation system, and spread bourgeois ideology and lifestyles. Their philosophy is "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others." They regard labor and the working people as the most lowly things. In the old society, workers, peasants, and other working people's children not only had no qualifications to enter universities at all, but also had few opportunities to even enter middle school or elementary school. Our Communist Labor University is fundamentally opposed to bourgeois universities. Our Communist Labor University is a proletarian university under the leadership of the Communist Party, a university of the working people, a university that cultivates all kinds of talents who strive to build socialism - communism. We regard labor as the noblest and most heroic undertaking. Workers, peasants, and other working people are the masters of our society. The various talents we cultivate come from production and return to production, serving labor production and construction. This is fundamentally different from the bourgeois universities' contempt for labor, detachment from production, and detachment from reality. Therefore, our university should be named the Communist Labor University.

　　Marxism-Leninism tells us that only people's social practice is the criterion for the truthfulness of people's understanding of the outside world. The so-called practice is also the practice of material production, the practice of class struggle, and the practice of scientific experimentation. In the past, our Party cultivated thousands of excellent revolutionary cadres on the battlefield and in the class struggle. Today, we must cultivate thousands of red experts in the practice of fighting against nature in barren mountains and wilderness. Chairman Mao also told us in the conclusion of "On Practice": "Through practice discover the truth, and again through practice verify and develop the truth. Actively develop from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, and again actively guide revolutionary practice from rational knowledge, transform the subjective world and the objective world. Practice, knowledge, re-practice, re-knowledge, this form, cycles endlessly, and the content of each cycle of practice and knowledge advances to a higher level. This is the entire epistemology of dialectical materialism, this is the dialectical materialist view of the unity of knowing and doing." I believe that our Communist Labor University is completely in line with the spirit indicated by Chairman Mao. In the process of production practice and learning, it will cultivate a large number of strong socialist construction talents and cultivate a pioneering fighting force that combines physical and mental labor for the transition from socialism to communism.

　　Although our school has now taken initial shape, with more than 20,000 students having already applied for admission, and it will soon reach 50,000 students, this is, after all, just the beginning. In the next few years, the Communist Labor University will develop from one main campus and thirty branch campuses to one hundred to one hundred and twenty. If each branch campus trains and cultivates an average of 4,000 students, we can train and cultivate 400,000 to 480,000 students. At that time, we will not only have perfect school buildings and complete equipment, but will also take the Communist Labor University and the comprehensive agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishing reclamation farms as the core, driving the great development of the entire mountainous areas and even the vast rural areas in economic, technological, and cultural undertakings. At that time, the students of the Communist Labor University will be distributed in the vast mountainous areas and rural areas of the province, and will become the backbone force in agriculture, forestry, industry, animal husbandry, aquaculture and other aspects!

　　We firmly believe that this new type of Communist Labor University has a bright and promising future and will make its due contribution to the socialist construction of the motherland and the realization of communism.

　　谈教育和劳动相结合
    ——江西省共产主义劳动大学开学有感
    中共江西省委书记　刘俊秀
    “八一”建军节这一天，江西省共产主义劳动大学总校和三十所分校，在全省各个山头垦殖场，同时举行了开学典礼，一种新型的无产阶级大学，宣告诞生了！
    共产主义劳动大学，是在怎样一种历史条件下筹办的呢？1957年冬，我们江西与全国各地一样，在整风、反右派斗争的基础上，掀起了冬季农业生产运动高潮和机关整改高潮，近五万名干部自动报名上山下乡。在井冈山等十多个山区，建立了一百十四个社会主义的农林牧渔综合垦殖场，共产主义劳动大学就在这些山区垦殖场中，兴办起来了。在目前开始建校的时候，它没有宽敞的校舍，也没有完美的设备，甚至有的就是茅屋草棚，风餐露宿。但是，我们共产主义劳动大学遵循着毛主席“工农知识分子化，知识分子工农化”的指示，确定了“勤工俭学，半工半读，生产与学习相结合，理论与实践相结合，政治与业务相结合”的教学方针。要求在荒山野地里培养锻炼“能文能武”“又红又专”具有共产主义风格的大批人材。
    8月1日，我以江西省共产主义劳动大学总校校长的身份，参加了总校的开学典礼。在这个开学典礼上，许多工农出身的青年男女，神采焕发地迈进了大学的门槛，他们有很多是刚刚放下锄头的农业社的干部和社员，也有的是工厂里的工人，也有许多本省和外省考入共产主义劳动大学的青年学生。看到这些新型的、真正属于无产阶级的大学生，引起我自己许多的感想和回忆。
    我是一个赤贫农的儿子，在十二岁的时候念了四十五天冬书。当时，有些好心的亲友，看我记忆力很强，有心想用祠堂的学田，送我去读书，可是，穷人家的孩子，耽误不起工，家里需要我去劳动，就这一点点希望也破灭了。饥饿、贫困，剥夺了我求学的机会，在我幼年和青年的时候，就不得不挑起生活的重担，给人家当牧童，在木厂当伙夫，挑煤炭，给地主当长工。为反抗地主的压迫剥削和卑视，到十九岁以后，我就一面在家种五、六亩租田，一面出外背木头，放木排，过着披星戴月，终日劳动，不得温饱的贫穷生活。
    是共产党救了我，是革命救了我，它不仅给我解除了饥饿贫困，而且从各方面关怀与培养我成为革命队伍中的一个红色战士。如果没有党的领导，不参加革命，就会使我一世贫穷，当一辈子文盲，落在愚昧无知的深渊里。
    当1927年，我二十三岁的时候，就参加了共产党，从此以后，在革命队伍里，我时时刻刻受着党的关怀和培养。在我参加革命的第二年，党就送我到永新县委举办的秘密训练班去学习，我记得这一次的主要课程是讲：马克思主义浅说；列宁论帝国主义三个基本矛盾；发动群众，打土豪，分田地，保护穷人，继续坚持革命斗争。党是我的启蒙老师。当时我最深刻的体会是当一个共产党员要忠实，勇敢，不怕死。努力工作，服从组织，遵守纪律，严守秘密，牺牲个人，永不叛党。这次学习，虽然下定了决心要革命，但对于马列主义的基本理论，还是不懂得。也还没有树立共产主义人生观。在这次学习后，经过六年多的实际工作，于1933年冬，我受湘赣边苏区人民的选举去参加全国第二届苏维埃代表大会，并由湘赣省委和省委书记任弼时同志亲自介绍我去红色首都——瑞金县，中央马克思共产主义大学高级班学习。学习内容：世界革命史；政治常识；共产党宣言；马列主义基本理论；党的建设；中国革命基本问题；游击战争等课程。一个被人践踏的雇工，竟然当上了全国人民代表，接着又能进马克思共产主义大学高级班当大学生，当时，我是多么兴奋啊！
    我在中央苏区学习期间，由于国民党反动派对中央苏区进行五次“围剿”，对苏区人民实行烧杀虏掠的政策，而造成我们的物质生活非常艰苦。开始时，吃饭每人每天有二十两米，后来减到十二两，二顿干饭各五两，稀饭二两。又没有油吃，没有盐吃，吃硝盐，把牙齿也吃坏了。吃菜只有老窝麻菜和老空心菜。饭吃不饱，菜吃不好，只好艰苦奋斗，坚决消灭敌人。可是，我仍然被这种新的学习环境所吸引，如获珍宝地拿着几本印刷粗糙的马列主义书籍，贪婪地读着。经过这次学习，它奠定了我的共产主义人生观，坚定了我革命的信心和意志。
    1934年7月毕业以后，中央当时派我随张云逸同志一同回湘赣工作，到湖南桂东与六军团会合，由于国民党反动军队占领了湘赣苏区，不能回湘赣，从此留在红六军团工作，参加了二万五千里长征。到1937年3月，西路军在青海失败以后，我带领一个游击小组，坚持了三个月的夜间游击活动，经过青海、甘肃、绥远、宁夏、陕西五个省份，走了六千多里路，通过敌人层层包围和封锁线，于同年6月初胜利地回到陕甘宁边区。党中央又送我到延安桥儿沟中央党校学习。1938年1月，从党校毕业后，中央分配我到晋西北工作。1940年12月回延安治病，1942年2月又进中央党校学习，当时毛泽东同志亲自担任党校校长，我荣幸地又当上了毛主席的学生。在这个理论和实践紧密结合的学校里，认真地学习了党的路线，研究了党的历史，更进一步地提高了自己的政治思想水平。党对我不断的培养、教育，使我由一个普通农民、一个文盲，变成了具有一定文化程度和理论水平的干部，在三十多年来，我所以能为革命做一些工作，这是同党和毛主席对我的培养教育分不开的。党的恩情，使我刻骨铭心，终身难忘。我的亲身经历，充分证实了党对于培养工农干部，理论与实践相结合的重要性和正确性。因此，在共产主义劳动大学总校开学典礼的时候，我谆谆告诫这些同学们：共产主义劳动大学，是叫同学们必须在党的领导下用自己的智慧和力量拿起两种武器——笔和生产工具，一面学习，一面生产。目前有许多人对我们这种办学方针还不大理解，甚至有错觉，有怀疑，不相信我们用这种办法，可以培养出：生产与学习相结合、业务与政治相结合、理论与实践相结合、脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合，又红又专的社会主义——共产主义建设人材。事实上，只有一面劳动，一面学习，才能够真正使业务和政治相结合、理论和实践相结合、脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合，工农知识分子化，知识分子工农化；才能够培养出既有革命理论，又有劳动生产技术和科学知识的全面人材。马列主义也告诉我们：只有劳动才能创造财富，只有劳动才能改造世界，只有劳动才能改造自然，只有劳动才能建成美满幸福的社会主义——共产主义社会。
    共产主义劳动大学，即共产主义再加上劳动二字，这正是我们新型大学的主要标志，这也是我们和过去任何资产阶级大学的根本区别。资产阶级的大学是按照资产阶级的意志，培养为资产阶级服务的知识分子，是为了巩固资产阶级的统治，资本主义剥削制度，传播资产阶级的思想意识和生活方式。他们的哲学是“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”，他们把劳动和劳动人民看做是最下贱的东西。在过去旧社会里，工人、农民和其他劳动人民子弟，不但根本没有资格进大学，就是连进中学以至进小学念书的机会也很少。我们的共产主义劳动大学和资产阶级大学是根本相反的，我们共产主义劳动大学是在共产党领导下的无产阶级大学，是劳动人民的大学，是培养为建设社会主义——共产主义事业而奋斗的各种各样人材的大学。我们把劳动看做是最高尚、最豪迈的事业，工人、农民和其他劳动人民是我们社会的主人，我们培养的各种人材，是从生产中来，又回到生产中去，为劳动生产建设而服务的，这就同资产阶级大学那种轻视劳动、脱离生产、脱离实际有着根本性的区别，因此，我们的大学要冠之以共产主义劳动大学的称号。
    马克思列宁主义告诉我们：只有人们的社会实践，才是人们对于外界认识的真理性的标准，所谓实践，也即是物质生产的实践，阶级斗争的实践，科学实验的实践，过去，我们党在战场上，在阶级斗争中曾经培养出成千成万的优秀的革命干部，今天我们要在荒山、野地向自然做斗争的实践中，培养出成千成万的红色专家，毛主席在“实践论”的结束语中也告诉我们：“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理。从感性认识而能动地发展到理性认识，又从理性认识而能动地指导革命实践，改造主观世界和客观世界。实践、认识、再实践、再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷，而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。这就是辩证唯物论的全部认识论，这就是辩证唯物论的知行统一观。”我认为我们的共产主义劳动大学，是完全符合毛主席所指示的精神，从生产实践中和学习过程中，会培养出大批的坚强的社会主义建设人材，并为社会主义过渡到共产主义培养出体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合的又红又专的先头战斗部队。
    我们现在的学校，虽然已经初具规模，现在已经报考入校的有二万多人，不久就可以达到五万学生，但这毕竟还是刚刚开始。共产主义劳动大学，在今后若干年内，要从一个总校、三十个分校发展到一百至一百二十个，每个分校平均训练和培养学生四千人，就可以训练和培养出学生四十万至四十八万人。那时候，我们不仅有完美的校舍，完善的设备，而且将会以共产主义劳动大学和农林牧渔综合垦殖场为核心，带动整个山区，以至农村广大人民，在经济、技术、文化事业上的大发展。那时候，共产主义劳动大学的学生，将分布在全省广大山区和农村，并将成为农业、林业、工业、畜牧业、水产等各个方面的骨干力量！
    我们坚信，这种新型的共产主义劳动大学，它的发展前途一定是光明的、远大的，一定会对祖国的社会主义建设事业、实现共产主义做出应有的贡献。
