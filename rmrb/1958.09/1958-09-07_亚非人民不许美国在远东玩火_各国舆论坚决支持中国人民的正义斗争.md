　　India
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 6th: The Indian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee issued a statement today strongly condemning the United States for continuing to interfere in the internal affairs of the Chinese people and obstructing the legitimate desire of the government of the People's Republic of China to liberate Chinese territory.
    The statement said, "Today, all of Asia supports the demand of the Chinese people: Taiwan and the coastal islands are part of Chinese territory, and any infringement upon its territory or territorial waters is intolerable."
    The statement expressed concern over the "unprecedented concentration" of American troops in the Chinese territorial waters and Chinese territory of Taiwan. The statement pointed out, "This anti-China action by the United States is doomed to failure, just as it failed in the Middle East." The statement solemnly demanded that the United States cease its aggressive threats and acts of aggression in the region and stop its support for the Chiang Kai-shek clique.
    The statement called on the committee's branches to launch a vigorous campaign demanding the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. Seventh Fleet and the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations.
　　Indonesia
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 5th: Silas Papare, a member of the West Irian Parliament of Indonesia, told Xinhua News Agency reporters today regarding the U.S. provocations in the Taiwan Strait: "No matter how many armed forces the United States uses, it will be defeated."
    Papare said that China has every right to recover Taiwan, just as Indonesia has every right to recover West Irian. He affirmed that the Chinese government will one day exercise its sovereignty over Taiwan, just as West Irian will one day return to its rightful owner, Indonesia.
    Mansjur, a member of the Nationalist Party and a member of the National Defense Subcommittee of the Parliament, also told Xinhua News Agency reporters today: "China's recovery of Taiwan and the coastal islands is an internal affair of China, and arbitrary foreign interference is absolutely intolerable."
    Mansjur said, "The concentration of American troops in the Taiwan Strait has created a danger of war, which the people of the world oppose." He warned that if the United States dared to risk fighting China, the consequences would be serious. He emphasized the fact that the Soviet Union supports China's struggle.
    Wedoyojo, the Secretary-General of the Progressive Nationalist faction in Parliament, told the press today that in order to resolve the crisis in the Taiwan Strait, the American occupation forces and their equipment must be withdrawn from the region. He pointed out that China's recovery of Taiwan is in line with the Bandung Conference's resolution on anti-colonialism. He said that China's demand to recover Taiwan is not "empty rhetoric" but "very serious."
    These three Indonesian parliamentarians unanimously pointed out that the current struggle of the Chinese people has won the sympathy and support of the broad masses of people, especially the people of Asian and African countries.
　　Burma
    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 5th: A statement issued by the Burmese National Assembly Party today said that the U.S. Seventh Fleet stopping China from liberating Taiwan is "an act that threatens world peace." The statement demanded an end to the aforementioned acts of aggression and respect for the independence and territory of Far Eastern countries.
    The statement also condemned the United States for interfering in the internal affairs of Lebanon, preventing the People's Republic of China from restoring its legitimate seat in the United Nations, and supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique.
    The statement also criticized the illegal activities of the Chiang Kai-shek army in invading Burma.
　　Cambodia
    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, September 5th: The Cambodian "Friendly Newspaper" published a commentary yesterday expressing concern about the current situation in the Taiwan Strait. The commentary wrote: "The Cambodian people firmly support the just struggle of the Chinese people."
    The "Friendly Newspaper" also pointed out that the rhetoric used by the United States and Britain in their statements to slander China's preparations to liberate the coastal islands is similar to the imperialists' accusations against Cambodia. When the Ngo Dinh Diem elements invaded the Cambodian border, the imperialists insisted that Cambodia was the disruptor of peace.
    The "Friendly Newspaper" went on to say that the imperialists similarly accused Indonesia's efforts to liberate West Irian and India's efforts to liberate Goa.
    "People's Daily" wrote in an editorial today: "There has only been one China since ancient times; Taiwan, Kinmen, and Matsu are inseparable parts of China."
    The "People's Daily" condemned the U.S. imperialists for "sending troops to Taiwan in order to more seriously interfere in China's internal affairs and threaten the Chinese people." The newspaper said, "However, the U.S. imperialists are in an unprecedentedly isolated situation, and if they dare to ignite the flames of war, they will suffer a shameful defeat."
　　Japan
    Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: TASS News Agency, Tokyo, September 5th: The All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations Special Congress closed in Tokyo on the 5th.
    The Congress passed a resolution protesting the U.S. aggression in the Taiwan region. The resolution stated that Japanese students firmly stand on the side of the Chinese people.
    The declaration passed by the Congress expressed the unanimous protest of Japanese students against the Kishida Nobusuke government's implementation of the reactionary "performance appraisal" system.
    All the delegates attending the Congress unanimously demanded that the Kishida Nobusuke government not arm the Japanese military with nuclear weapons and not allow nuclear weapons to be transported into Japanese territory.
　　UAR
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 6th: The Cairo "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 5th condemning U.S. Secretary of State Dulles for threatening to continue to use force to interfere in China's internal affairs. The editorial said that this is "a direct act of aggression that threatens the peace of the entire world."
    The newspaper warned the United States that the whole world is condemning the U.S. policy of threatening the use of force, and if the United States insists on its current aggressive policy, its future losses will be much more devastating than its previous failures. The newspaper also said, "The United States will see everyone accuse it of being the number one war criminal."
    The commentator of the "People's Daily" accused the United States on the 5th of carrying out aggression on two fronts, the Middle East and the Far East, and of leading the world to the brink of war in order to achieve ulterior motives. However, the commentator pointed out that the Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, will never allow the United States to benefit from this policy. The commentator also reminded the United States that from China to the Atlantic, the people of Asia and Africa are united in their struggle against imperialism.
　　Iraq
    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, September 6th: Iraq Republic Radio broadcast a commentary on the evening of the 5th saying: All the Arab people are determined to support the struggle of the People's Republic of China to resist imperialist aggression and to try to liberate Taiwan, a part of its national territory occupied by imperialism by force.
    The commentary said that the Arab people are struggling to insist on liberating Jordan and Lebanon from the occupation of imperialist troops, and to defeat all conspiracies against the Republic of Iraq and the Syrian region. They are also vigilant and support their Chinese brothers in the spirit of solidarity in their struggle against the imperialist aggressors.
    The commentary pointed out that it was the U.S. aggressors who incited Syngman Rhee to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and ordered Israel to attack Egypt in 1956. The commentary said that they are war profiteers, oil plunderers, and they invaded Lebanon and Jordan, turning Beirut into a base for the Sixth Fleet, which, like its brother the Seventh Fleet in the Pacific, raised the flag of piracy in the Mediterranean.
    The commentary concluded by pointing out that people all over the world are increasingly protesting the actions of the United States. Public opinion in Iraq, the United Arab Republic, and other parts of the world expresses support and sympathy for the People's Republic of China.
　　African People's Union
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 6th: According to the Middle East News Agency's report from Khartoum, the African People's Union, representing various African peoples, announced on the 5th its support for the Chinese people's struggle to liberate the occupied Chinese territory.
    The union also expressed its willingness to carry out this struggle side by side with the Chinese people.

　　亚非人民不许美国在远东玩火
    各国舆论坚决支持中国人民的正义斗争
　　印度
    据新华社新德里6日电　印度亚非团结委员会今天发表声明，强烈谴责美国继续干涉中国人民的内政和阻挠中华人民共和国政府解放中国领土的合法愿望。
    声明说，“今天全亚洲都支持中国人民的这一要求：台湾和沿海岛屿是中国领土的一部分，侵犯它的领土或领海是不能容许的。”
    声明对美国在中国领海和中国领土台湾“空前地集结”它的部队感到不安。声明指出，“美国的这种反对中国的行动是注定要失败的，正像它在中东遭到失败一样”。声明严正要求美国停止它在这一地区的侵略威胁和侵略行动，并且停止它对蒋介石集团的支持。
    声明号召委员会的分会展开热烈的运动，要求美国第七舰队立即撤离，并且恢复中国在联合国的席位。
　　印度尼西亚
    据新华社雅加达5日电印度尼西亚西伊里安议员西拉斯·帕帕勒今天就美国在台湾海峡进行挑衅一事对新华社记者发表谈话说：“不管美国使用的武装部队有多少，它将遭到失败。”
    帕帕勒说，中国完全有权收复台湾，正像印度尼西亚完全有权收复西伊里安一样。他肯定认为中国政府总有一天会对台湾行使它的主权，正像西伊里安总有一天要回到它的合法的主人印度尼西亚来一样。
    国民党议员、国会国防小组委员会委员曼休尔今天也对新华社记者说：“中国收复台湾和沿海岛屿是中国内部问题，外国专断的干涉是绝对不能容许的。”
    曼休尔说：“美国在台湾海峡集中军队，这造成了战争的危险，全世界人民都反对战争。”他警告说，要是美国敢于冒险同中国作战，后果会是严重的。他着重指出了苏联支持中国斗争的事实。
    国会里的进步民族系总书记韦多约今天对报界说，为了解决台湾海峡的危机，美国占领军和它的装备必须撤出这个地区。他指出，中国收复台湾是符合万隆会议关于反殖民主义的决议的。他说，中国收复台湾的要求不是“虚声恫吓”，而是“非常认真的”。
    这三位印度尼西亚议员都一致指出，中国人民目前的斗争博得了广大人民群众，特别是亚非各国人民的同情和支持。
　　缅甸
    新华社仰光5日电　缅甸国民大会党今天发表的一项声明说，美国第七舰队停止中国解放台湾，“是一种威胁世界和平的行为”。声明要求停止上述侵略活动，并且尊重远东国家的独立和领土。
    声明还谴责了美国干涉黎巴嫩的内政、阻止中华人民共和国恢复在联合国中的合法席位、支持蒋介石集团的行为。
    声明还指责了蒋介石军队侵犯缅甸的非法活动。
　　柬埔寨
    新华社金边5日电　柬埔寨“友好报”昨天发表一篇评论对目前台湾海峡的局势表示关注，评论写道：“柬埔寨人民坚决支持中国人民的正义斗争”。
    “友好报”还指出，美英两国在它们所发表的声明中对中国准备解放沿海岛屿进行诽谤的那种论调，是同帝国主义者对柬埔寨的责难相类似，在发生吴庭艳分子侵犯柬埔寨边境的事件时，帝国主义者硬说柬埔寨是和平的破坏者。
    “友好报”接着说，帝国主义者同样地责难印度尼西亚解放西伊里安的努力和印度解放果阿的努力。
    “人民报”今天在社论中写道：“自从远古以来就只有一个中国；台湾、金门、马祖是中国的不可分割的一部分”。
    “人民报”谴责美帝国主义者“派遣军队到台湾去，以便更严重地干涉中国的内政和威胁中国人民”。这家报纸说：“但是，美帝国主义者处于空前孤立的境地，如果他们敢于点起战火，他们就将遭到可耻的失败。”
　　日本
    新华社6日讯据塔斯社东京5日讯：全日本学生自治会总联合会特别代表大会5日在东京闭幕。
    代表大会通过决议，抗议美国在台湾地区的侵略行动。决议中说，日本学生坚决站在中国人民这一边。
    代表大会通过的宣言表示日本学生一致抗议岸信介政府实行反动的“勤务评定”制度。
    参加大会的全体代表一致要求岸信介政府不要用核武器武装日本军队和不允许把核武器运进日本领土。
　　阿联
    新华社开罗6日电　开罗“人民报”5日发表社论，谴责美国国务卿杜勒斯扬言要继续用武力干涉中国内政。社论说，这是“威胁着整个世界和平的直接侵略行为”。
    这家报纸警告美国说，全世界都在谴责美国以使用武力相威胁的政策，如果美国坚持目前的侵略政策，美国今后的损失将比以往的失败惨重得多。这家报纸又说：“美国将看见大家都指责它是头号战争罪犯”。
      “人民报”的评论员5日指责了美国在中东和远东两个战线上进行侵略，而且为了达到不可告人的目的，把世界引向战争边缘。但是，评论员指出，占世界人口四分之一的中国人民绝不容许美国从这种政策中得到任何好处。评论员又提醒美国：从中国直至大西洋，亚非各国人民团结一致在为反对帝国主义而斗争。
　　伊拉克
    据新华社巴格达6日电　伊拉克共和国电台在5日晚上发表评论说：全体阿拉伯人民决心支持中华人民共和国抵御帝国主义的侵略并且设法解放被帝国主义用武力侵占的本国领土一部分——台湾的斗争。
    评论说，阿拉伯人民正在为坚持把约旦和黎巴嫩从帝国主义军队占领下解放出来，并且为击败反对伊拉克共和国和叙利亚地区的一切阴谋而进行斗争，他们也提高警惕，本着团结精神来支持他们的中国兄弟为反对帝国主义侵略者而进行的斗争。
    评论指出，正是美国侵略者曾经唆使李承晚进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并且在1956年命令以色列进攻埃及。评论说，他们是战争贩子，是石油劫掠者，他们侵入黎巴嫩和约旦，把贝鲁特变成第六舰队的一个基地，而第六舰队像它的兄弟第七舰队在太平洋上所干的一样，在地中海升起了海盗匪帮的旗帜。
    评论最后指出，全世界人民日益强烈地抗议美国的行动。伊拉克、阿拉伯联合共和国以及世界其他各地的舆论都表示支援和同情中华人民共和国。
　　非洲人联盟
    新华社开罗6日电　据中东通讯社自喀土穆报道，代表非洲各种人民的非洲人联盟5日宣布支持中国人民解放被占领的中国领土的斗争。
    这个联盟并且表示愿意同中国人民并肩进行这个斗争。
