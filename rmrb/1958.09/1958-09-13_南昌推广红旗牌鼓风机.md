Nanchang, September 12th (By our own correspondent) - The Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a new and simple Hongqi (Red Flag) brand blower. The Hongqi brand blower has many advantages: it saves labor, saves materials, has low cost, convenient transportation, and simple manufacturing technology, suitable for the needs of the people-run iron and steel industry. An actual five-number Roots blower weighs more than 2,000 kilograms, with more than 90 kinds of parts of all sizes, requiring more than 360 man-hours and nine different models of ball bearings. The Hongqi brand blower manufactured by the Jiangxi Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory has an actual weight of 200 kilograms, only one-tenth of the weight of the Roots blower. It has more than 30 kinds of parts of all sizes, each requiring only 100 to 150 man-hours and only four ball bearings of one model, costing no more than 1,000 yuan. The air volume reaches 30 cubic meters, the same as the five-number Roots blower and can be used for a 0.5-ton converter.

In the trial production process, the workers used their brains, thought of ways, and broke the constraints of theoretical conventions. For example, according to theoretical regulations, the circumferential speed of the rotor is generally about 8 to 10 meters per second, and the maximum should not exceed 15 meters. When encountering this problem, the technicians boldly carried out innovative trial production, increasing the number of revolutions to 1,460 revolutions per minute, and the circumferential speed to 25.2 meters per second. This improvement enabled the air volume to reach the requirement of 30 cubic meters. At the same time, because the technically complex gear box part was eliminated, the volume was greatly reduced and the cost was greatly reduced.

The Nanchang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened an on-site meeting to determine the vigorous promotion and manufacture of this blower.

    南昌推广红旗牌鼓风机
    本报南昌12日电　江西省农业机械修配厂最近试制成功一种新式简便的红旗牌鼓风机。红旗牌鼓风机优点很多：省工、省料、成本低、运输方便、制造技术简单，适合于民办钢铁工业的需要。一台五号罗茨式鼓风机的实际重量达二千多公斤，全部大小零件九十余种，需工时三百六十多个小时，各种不同型号的弹子九只。江西农业机械修配厂制的红旗牌鼓风机，每台实际重量为二百公斤，只及罗茨式鼓风机重量的十分之一，全部大小零件三十多种，每台所需工时仅为一百至一百五十小时，每台只要一种型号弹子四只，价值不超过一千元，鼓风量则达三十立方公尺，和五号罗茨式鼓风机一样可以用于零点五吨的转炉。
    在试制过程中，职工们动脑筋、想办法，打破了理论上陈规的约束。如按理论规定：转子圆周速度一般为每秒八到十公尺左右，最大的不能超过十五公尺，在遇到这个难题时，技术人员大胆地进行了革新试制，将转数提高到每分钟一千四百六十转，圆周速度为每秒二十五点二公尺，这一改进就使鼓风量达到了三十立方公尺的要求，同时又因省掉了技术较复杂的牙齿箱部分，体积大大缩小，成本大大降低。
    中共南昌市委最近召开了现场会议，确定大力推广制造这种鼓风机。
