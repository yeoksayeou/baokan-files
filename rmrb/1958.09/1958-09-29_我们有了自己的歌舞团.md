We, the Hundred Flowers Farmers' Song and Dance Troupe of Tangfang People's Commune in Fengrun, Hebei, were established during the upsurge of communization in Fengrun County, and were born at the same time as our Tangfang People's Commune. In the twenty days since the troupe was founded, we have put together a program for an evening performance, including the four-part grand song and dance "The Flowers of the People's Commune are in Full Bloom." Coming to Beijing this time to offer a tribute performance to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao was a determination we made when we founded the troupe. Because without the Party's General Line, without Chairman Mao's call, we would not be able to establish a commune today, nor would we be able to establish a song and dance troupe.

In order to realize our wish to perform in Beijing as soon as possible, all comrades in the troupe intensified rehearsals, in the sun during the day, under the moon at night, and sometimes even rehearsed in the rain. From the beginning of the preparations for the establishment of the troupe, the county Party committee and the commune Party committee constantly gave us instructions and assistance in various aspects. Secretary Peng and Secretary Bu of the county Party committee secretariat and Secretary Miao of the commune Party committee all came to see our rehearsals. In order to help us select talents, the grassroots Party organizations also convened general meetings of young people to select them one by one, and actively recommended excellent artists to participate, so that our troupe was equipped with better political and artistic conditions from the beginning.

The Hundred Flowers Farmers' Song and Dance Troupe was established in accordance with the Party's policy of combining literature and art with labor production. It is a song and dance troupe and also a production team. The actors must not only be good at singing and dancing, but also be advanced-thinking production experts. Most of the members are the backbone of literary and artistic activities in various villages, and were rated as "six-good" or "five-good" members in the "Six-Good Comparison" campaign. The programs we rehearse all reflect labor life and cooperate with the central tasks. For example, the "The Flowers of the People's Commune are in Full Bloom" we created this time was created in conjunction with the communization movement.

After our troupe was established, it received meticulous care from the masses even before it performed. The old ladies were afraid that we would eat too dry food and made soup for us to drink. Sometimes when we rehearsed until midnight, they would prepare hot water for us to drink and wash before going to bed. This all shows the masses' love for their own actors and their urgent need for literary and artistic life, which is the greatest encouragement to us.

    我们有了自己的歌舞团
    河北丰润唐坊人民公社  百花农民歌舞团团长  董盛岭
    我们百花农民歌舞团是在丰润县掀起公社化高潮的时候建立起来的，也是和我们唐坊人民公社同时诞生的。建团二十天，我们就排出了一个晚会的节目，其中包括四场的大歌舞“人民公社鲜花开”。这一次我们来到北京向党中央和毛主席作献礼演出，是我们建团时就下定的决心。因为如果没有党的总路线，没有毛主席的号召，我们今天就成立不了公社，也成立不了歌舞团。
    为了早日实现到北京来演出的愿望，全团同志加紧排练，白天在太阳地里，夜晚在月亮底下，有时还淋着雨排练过。从开始筹备建团起，县党委、社党委不断地给了我们各方面的指示和帮助。县党委书记处彭书记、卜书记和社党委苗书记都来看过我们排练。基层党组织为了帮助我们选拔人才，还召开全体青年大会一个个来挑选，又积极地推荐了优秀的艺人来参加，使得我们这个团从开始就具备了较好的政治条件和艺术条件。
    百花农民歌舞团是本着党提出的文艺和劳动生产相结合的方针建立起来的，它是个歌舞团，也是个生产队，演员不只能歌善舞，还要是思想进步的生产能手。大部分团员都是各村的文艺活动骨干，在“六好评比”运动中被评为六好或五好的社员。我们排练的节目都是反映劳动生活和配合中心任务的，如这次我们创作的“人民公社鲜花开”就是结合公社化运动排出来的。
    我们团成立以后，还没有演出，就受到了群众无微不至的关心。老大娘怕我们吃得太干，给我们做汤喝，有时候排练到半夜，还给我们准备着热水，等我们回来喝了洗了才睡，这都说明群众对自己的演员的热爱和对文艺生活的迫切要求，这是给予我们的最大的鼓舞。
