The youth, militia, and support-the-front stretcher teams of Tongyu Township, Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, located on the East China Sea front, held a meeting on the evening of the 7th, warmly supporting Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait and angrily denouncing the war provocations of U.S. imperialism. More than 500 members of the Communist Youth League and more than 300 core militia members in the township unanimously stated that they would make all preparations, and as long as the Party and the motherland give an order, they can go to any place where they are needed, fiercely attack the U.S. aggressors, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek remnant clique, and liberate Taiwan. Zhang Yutou, a militia captain and member of the Communist Youth League who participated in the support work for the liberation of Yijiangshan and Dachen Islands, said: U.S. imperialism and the Chiang bandits are unwilling to accept our motherland's great leap forward and are doing everything possible to create a tense situation. Our youth are fully determined to support the defeat of the U.S. aggressors and liberate Taiwan.

At the meeting, the youth of the township unanimously passed a resolution to support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions in the following five aspects:

	I. Make all preparations, respond to the call of the Party and the motherland at any time, provide people, grain, and steel to support the liberation of Taiwan and defeat the U.S. aggressors.
	II. With greater enthusiasm, do a good job in the current late rice field management, do a good job in resisting floods, washing seedlings, protecting seedlings, fertilizing, and controlling insects to ensure that late rice surpasses early rice.
	III. Vigorously support the iron and steel industry, take the lead in and mobilize the completion of the task of collecting eight catties of waste copper and iron and five bricks per person ahead of schedule.
	IV. Strengthen the militia organization and public security work, form a dragnet, and resolutely eliminate the U.S.-Chiang agents who dare to invade and sneak into the mainland.
	V. Resolutely run the people's communes well.

The military provocations and war threats of U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait have aroused the unparalleled anger of our 350,000 veterans and militia in the Changzhi area. Everyone unanimously stated: We must strengthen preparedness training, stand by for the motherland's call at any time, do a good job in local public security, vigorously produce iron and steel, and do a good job in autumn planting, autumn harvesting, and autumn plowing to support Premier Zhou's statement and combat the heinous activities of the war maniacs.

The 350,000 veterans, militia, and armed backbone teams distributed in cities, towns, villages, factories, mines, government offices, reservoirs, and construction sites all held grand demonstrations in the evening of the 7th with angry hearts and live ammunition. 110,000 militia members from Qinyuan, Huguan, Gaoping, Jincheng and other counties and Changzhi City, carrying weapons and torches, shouted in unison: We will not allow U.S. bandits to run rampant on our territory! U.S. imperialism get out of Taiwan! Zhang Xiaobao, the national militia hero and militia captain of Changxing Township, Huguan County, and Dou Bing'an, the militia hero of Qinyuan County and deputy director of Chengguan Township People's Commune, represented the militia of the whole county at the demonstration and stated: We must carry forward the glorious tradition of the old base area militia, use the courage of the "cave defense war" and "two-and-a-half-year siege of the enemy" to "carry guns on the land, practice martial arts during rest, everyone learn live ammunition shooting, and obey the call of the motherland at any time!" More than 11,000 demobilized soldiers from the Fourth Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, who had frightened the U.S. imperialists on the Korean battlefield and are now in charge of building the Zhandong Railway, organized a worker-militia backbone regiment overnight after the parade to prepare to return to the front line at any time. The 15,000 militia members fighting on the "August 1st" Reservoir and Shencun Reservoir marched on the evening of the 7th and then threw themselves into battle overnight. They proposed: Treat the night as day, practice martial arts and produce, and use greater achievements to support the liberation of Taiwan.

    民兵誓以实际行动惩办侵略者
    我们地处东海前线的浙江省黄岩县桐屿乡青年、民兵和支前担架队员，于7日晚上集会，热烈拥护周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，愤怒地斥责美帝国主义的战争挑衅。全乡五百多名共青团员，三百多名基干民兵，一致表示要作好一切准备，只要党和祖国一声号令，可以到任何需要的地方去，狠狠地打击美国侵略者，消灭蒋介石残余集团，解放台湾。曾经参加过解放一江山、大陈岛支前工作的民兵队长、共青团员张玉头说：美帝国主义和蒋匪帮死不甘心我们祖国的大跃进，千方百计制造紧张局势，我们青年完全有决心支援打垮美国侵略者，解放台湾。
    会上全乡青年一致通过决心书，要从下面五个方面的实际行动来支援解放台湾：
    一、做好一切准备，随时响应党和祖国的号召，要人有人，要粮有粮，要钢铁有钢铁，支援解放台湾，打败美国侵略者。
    二、以更大的干劲，搞好当前晚稻田间管理，做好抗涝、洗苗、护苗、施肥、治虫，确保晚稻超早稻。
    三、大力支援钢铁工业，带头、动员提前完成每户八斤废铜铁、每人五块砖的收集任务。

    美帝国主义在台湾海峡的军事挑衅和战争威胁，激起了我们长治区三十五万复员军人和民兵的无比愤怒。大家一致表示：要以加强战备训练、随时听候祖国召唤、搞好地方治安、大闹钢铁生产、做好秋种、秋收、秋耕等工作的实际行动，拥护周总理的声明，打击战争疯子的罪恶活动。
    分布在城、镇、乡、村、厂矿、机关、水库、工地上的三十五万复员军人、民兵、武装基干队，7日晚上都以愤怒的心情荷枪实弹，连夜举行了盛大的示威游行。沁源、壶关、高平，晋城等县和长治市参加游行的十一万民兵，扛着武器，拿着火炬一致高呼：不容许美国强盗在我国领土上横行霸道！美帝国主义从台湾滚出去！全国民兵杀敌英雄、壶关县常行乡民兵队长张小保，沁源县民兵杀敌英雄、城关乡人民公社副主任窦丙安等，都在示威大会上代表全县民兵表示：要发扬老根据地民兵的光荣传统，用“窑洞保卫战”和“二年半围困敌人”的勇气，做到“上地带枪，休息练武，人人学会实弹射击，随时听从祖国召唤！”曾经在朝鲜战场上打得美帝心惊胆寒、现在担任修建詹东铁路的铁道部四局一万一千多名转业军人，在游行后连夜组织了一个职工民兵基干团，准备随时重返前线。战斗在“八一”水库和申村水库上的一万五千名民兵7日晚间游行后，星夜投入战斗，他们提出：黑夜当白天，练武又生产，用更大的成绩，支援解放台湾。
