    Scientific Undertakings Must Serve Socialist Construction

    The national congress of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies (referred to as "Science Federation" for short) and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization (referred to as "Science Popularization") is opening today in Beijing. During the upsurge of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the technical and cultural revolutions, representatives of science and technology from across the country have gathered together to jointly discuss how to further develop China's science and technology work. This is a major event in the process of China's technical and cultural revolutions.

    Over the past eight years, under the leadership of the Party, the National Science Federation and the Science Popularization Association have done a lot of work and gained certain experiences. The Science Federation has established 42 societies across the country, developed nearly 100,000 members, and organized various academic research activities. The Science Popularization Association has established more than 50,000 grassroots organizations across the country, developed more than one million members, and carried out popular science education to the general public through various means. According to statistics, over 1.08 billion people have participated in various lectures, exhibitions, and watched movies and slides. Especially after the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, under the leadership of the Party, the Science Federation and the Science Popularization Association, in coordination with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, have done a lot of work and achieved great results in summarizing and promoting advanced technical experiences and inventions and creations among the masses, and in carrying out mass scientific research.

    However, the work already done is far from meeting the needs of China's rapidly developing socialist construction. China's science and technology community is facing a great historical task: the Party and the people of the whole country require the realization of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution, the development of China's social productive forces at the highest speed, the realization of the modernization of industry and agriculture as quickly as possible, the completion of the "Twelve-Year Science Development Plan" ahead of schedule, and the construction of China into a socialist society with highly developed productive forces, science, technology, and culture, and to create conditions for the gradual transition to communism.

    How can China's science and technology community, under the leadership of the Party, highly exert its strength and work together with the people of the whole country to accomplish this major task? The most important thing is to implement the policy of science and technology serving production and serving socialist construction; scientific and technological work must be led by politics, and the Party's leadership over scientific and technological work must be thoroughly realized; it is necessary to break down superstition, liberate the mind, resolutely follow the mass line, and have the whole Party and the whole people run scientific and technological undertakings in a big way. Only in this way can scientific and technological work achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and realize the general line of building socialism.

    Since the beginning of this year, the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country has created very favorable conditions for the great development of science and technology in our country, and at the same time has brought great pressure to scientific and technological research work. That is to say, socialist construction urgently needs the science and technology community to highly exert its strength, serve production, and promote the development of production. Science and technology can only be developed and improved in production practice. Engels said: "The emergence and development of science has been determined by production from the beginning." Comrade Mao Zedong also said in "On Practice": "Man's knowledge mainly depends on material production activities." There is no historical period in the world when production is backward and science and technology can be developed in isolation. But bourgeois scientists don't see it that way. Because the bourgeoisie is divorced from material production activities and from the working people, the intellectuals and scientific and technological personnel belonging to this class believe that science and technology can be developed independently from production practice. In their view, science serving production reduces the value of science; it seems that production practice cannot produce valuable scientific theories, and only the books and documents in their hands and research divorced from production can obtain profound theories and mysterious science. This is of course putting the cart before the horse.

    Production practice produces science, and production tasks can drive the development of science. This year's great leap forward in agricultural production in our country, the large-scale increase in production and the high-yield "satellites" provide new laws and new theories in a series of issues such as deep plowing, soil, fertilization, crop cultivation, physiology, and protection, which is the best explanation. On the contrary, some agricultural scientists, divorced from the production practice of farmers, conduct research for the sake of science, and although the laboratory has complete equipment and the experimental field has various superior conditions, the yield per mu of the field planted is only a few hundred catties. Compared with the farmers' yield of several thousand catties or tens of thousands of catties per mu, whose method is more scientific? Shouldn't scientific research similar to this, which is divorced from production and lags behind production practice, be thoroughly changed?

    To make scientific and technological research work leap forward, there must be strong leadership from the Party over scientific and technological undertakings. This is the most fundamental guarantee for the development of scientific and technological undertakings in our country, and it is also the main key to determining whether scientific and technological undertakings take the socialist road or the capitalist road. The bourgeois scientists' view that the Party cannot lead science has been refuted by facts. The rightists in the scientific community once used "laymen cannot lead experts" as a slogan to attack the Party, and they were thoroughly defeated by the people of the whole country. In addition, there are still some people in the scientific community who, after the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, have chosen the socialist road politically, but still lack a correct understanding of the Party's leadership over science and the relationship between politics and science. They believe that they should obey the Party's leadership politically, but scientific work is another matter; or that the Party can only conduct principled leadership on the general policies of scientific undertakings, and as for specific scientific work, it can only be led by scientists. This is actually separating politics and work, and the result is still to separate scientific undertakings from the leadership of the Party. The Party's leadership over science is not abstract, and the Party's leadership must be implemented in all aspects and all specific work of scientific undertakings. Why can the Party lead the leap forward in science? The Communist Party has two weapons: one is Marxism-Leninism, and the other is the mass line. Relying on these two weapons, it can lead everything. Marxism-Leninism is the science of all sciences. The Party uses Marxism-Leninism to most correctly understand the laws of human society and the laws of nature. Marxism-Leninism advocates the combination of theory and practice, and the combination of mental labor and physical labor. This turns the one-sided knowledge in books into complete and comprehensive knowledge. Starting from comprehensive knowledge and then analyzing and judging from a dialectical point of view, any complex problem can be found. Therefore, any scientific research will get the correct conclusion faster than bourgeois scholars and experts. Not only that, the Party also fully relies on the masses and mobilizes the masses to guide millions of people to explore in the right direction, which will inevitably promote the emergence of new scientific theories and inventions and creations more quickly. If the direction is right and the enthusiasm is high, the subjective initiative of people can be highly exerted, the development of social productive forces can be promoted, and the face of nature can be transformed. The great leap forward in agricultural production in our country has made great theoretical contributions to agricultural science and technology. This is the best explanation that the Communist Party can lead science. In recent months, many scientific research institutions and universities have also set off a great leap forward in scientific undertakings, constantly creating miracles. Many things that I didn't even dare to think about in the past, or that I thought could only be done in ten or eight years, have been completed in just a few days or dozens of days. This is of course not because the scientists' scientific knowledge and technical skills have suddenly increased, but because the leadership of the Party has been implemented, politics has been put in command, bourgeois ideas have been broken, and the communist ideas of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do have been established.

    In the great leap forward of scientific undertakings, the grassroots Party organizations of many scientific research institutions have become the headquarters for commanding battles. The Party organization concentrated the wisdom of the masses, analyzed the situation, studied the problems, came up with ideas, found solutions, and organized and mobilized forces. Everyone united around the Party, forming a fighting collective, full of energy and confidence, and was truly invincible. Many leading members of Party organizations are not experts in science and technology, and they lead various scientific research. In their work, they often mobilize the masses to conduct discussions and debates, comprehensively and correctly analyze and study various contradictions, find the key to the problem, and mobilize the masses to solve it. Some scientists, who personally participated in and experienced such things, realized that: "The leadership of the Party is the most important, and politics is the first."

    The Party has always mobilized the whole Party and the whole people to run any undertaking. But bourgeois scientists believe that the method of mass movement is not applicable to scientific research. They believe that this will mess things up, that the masses do not understand science, and that scientific research can only be done by a few people in the laboratory, coldly and slowly. Such arguments must be eliminated. In order to implement the mass line in scientific and technological work, it is necessary to: First, continue to break down superstition and liberate the mind. If the mysterious concept of scientific research is not broken, and the superstition of foreign countries, books, and experts is not broken, the masses cannot be mobilized. Second, the professional scientific workers must be combined with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and the improvement and popularization must be combined. The workers and peasants have accumulated rich experience in the long-term production process, especially since the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in all walks of life, they have many inventions and creations, and many skilled workers and experts have emerged. Professional scientific workers should be well combined with them, learn from them, and at the same time help them to summarize, improve, and promote from the theoretical level. In this way, popularization and improvement can be well combined, the mass scientific research and inventions and creations can be guided by theory, and the improvement of science also has a realistic foundation. Third, both indigenous and foreign methods should be used. In the long-term labor life, the workers and peasants of our country have created many indigenous methods to fight against nature, such as the current large number of indigenous pesticides, indigenous chemical fertilizers, and indigenous blast furnaces. These things seem simple, but they also have scientific principles in them, and they can suit China's reality and solve major problems in production. The long-standing historical traditions of traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and the rich experience in agricultural production in our country have great scientific value in the world. One must never despise one's own indigenous methods, and one should not be superstitious about foreign methods. As long as foreign methods are advanced and needed by us, we should try our best to learn them. Fourth, the whole Party and the whole people should be mobilized to run science in a big way. The Science Federation and the Science Popularization organizations should become powerful assistants to the Party in mobilizing the masses to run science in a big way. It is necessary to further establish organizations, develop members, and cooperate with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in rural areas, factories, mines, organs, and schools, vigorously carry out scientific and technological publicity, education, research, summary, and promotion work, and carry out a massive scientific research and technological revolution movement among the people of the whole country.

    We believe that through the joint discussion of representatives of science and technology circles from all over the country this time, this work will definitely be greatly developed. We wish the conference a success.

    科学事业必须为社会主义建设服务
    中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会（简称科联）和中华全国科学技术普及协会（简称科普）的全国代表大会今天在北京开幕了。在工农业生产大跃进和技术革命、文化革命的高潮中，全国科学技术的代表人物齐集一堂来共同讨论如何进一步开展我国的科学技术工作，这是我国技术革命和文化革命过程中的一件大事。
    全国科联、科普八年以来，在党的领导下，作了很多工作，也取得了一定的经验。科联在全国各地建立了四十二个学会，发展了近十万会员，组织了各种学术研究活动。科普在全国各地已经建立了五万多个基层组织，发展了一百多万会员，并通过各种方式向广大群众进行了科学知识的普及宣传教育工作。据统计，参加过各种讲演会、展览会和看过电影、幻灯的，即达十亿八千多万人次。特别是在整风和反右派斗争以后，科联、科普在党的领导下，配合工农业生产大跃进，对总结和推广群众中的先进技术经验和发明创造的成果，开展群众性的科学研究，作了很多工作，有很大的成绩。
    但是，已有的工作还远不能满足我国正在迅速发展的社会主义建设的需要。我国的科学技术界面临着一个伟大的历史任务：党和全国人民要求实现技术革命和文化革命，以最高的速度发展我国的社会生产力，尽可能快地实现工业和农业的现代化，提前完成“十二年科学发展规划”，把我国建成一个生产力和科学技术文化高度发达的社会主义社会并为逐步过渡到共产主义创造条件。
    我国的科学技术界如何在党的领导下高度发挥自己的力量，同全国人民一起来完成这个重大的任务呢？最重要的就是要贯彻执行科学技术为生产服务、为社会主义建设服务的方针；科学技术工作必须政治挂帅，彻底实现党对科学技术工作的领导；要破除迷信，解放思想，坚决走群众路线，全党、全民大办科学技术事业。只有这样，才能使科学技术工作达到多快好省，实现建设社会主义的总路线。
    今年以来我国工农业生产的大跃进已经为我国科学技术的大发展创造了十分有利的条件，同时也给科学技术研究工作带来了很大的压力。这也就是说，社会主义建设迫切需要科学技术界高度发挥自己的力量，为生产服务，推动生产的发展。科学技术只有在生产实践中才能得到发展和提高。恩格斯说过：“科学的发生和发展，从开始起便是由生产所决定的。”毛泽东同志在“实践论”中也说过：“人的认识，主要地依赖于物质的生产活动。”世界上没有那一个历史时期，生产落后，而科学技术能够孤立地得到发展的。但资产阶级的科学家却不这么看。资产阶级由于脱离了物质的生产活动，脱离了劳动人民，属于这个阶级的知识分子和科学技术人员，认为科学技术可以离开生产实际单独地得到发展。在他们看来，科学为生产服务，就降低了科学的价值；好像生产实践不能产生有价值的科学理论，只有他们手头的书本文献和脱离生产的研究，才可以求得高深的理论和奥妙的科学。这当然是本末倒置的。
    生产实践出科学，生产任务可以带动科学的发展。今年我国的农业生产大跃进，大面积增产和高产“卫星”给深耕、土壤、施肥、农作物的栽培、生理和保护等一系列的问题上所提供的新的规律、新的理论，就是一个最好的说明。相反的，有些农业科学家，脱离农民的生产实际，为科学而科学地进行研究，试验室里虽有完善的设备，种试验田虽有各种优越的条件，但是种出的田只能亩产几百斤。这同农民的亩产几千斤、几万斤相比，谁的作法更合乎科学呢？难道类似这种脱离生产和落后于生产实际的科学研究，不应该彻底地改变吗？
    要使科学技术研究工作跃进，必须有党对科学技术事业的坚强的领导。这是发展我国科学技术事业的最根本的保证，也是决定科学技术事业走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的主要关键。资产阶级科学家认为党不能领导科学，已经被事实所驳倒。科学界的右派分子曾以“外行不能领导内行”作为向党进攻的口号，他们被全国人民彻底打垮了。另外，在科学界也还有些人，经过整风和反右派斗争，他们在政治上选择了社会主义的道路，但对党领导科学，对政治和科学的关系，还缺乏正确的认识。他们认为，在政治上应该服从党的领导，但在科学业务上则是另外一回事；或者说，党对科学事业只能在大政方针上进行原则性的领导，至于涉及到具体的科学业务，还只能由科学家来领导。这实际上是把政治和业务分裂开来，其结果还是使科学事业脱离开党的领导。党对科学的领导不是抽象的，必须把党的领导贯彻到科学事业的各个方面和各项具体工作中去。党为什么就能领导科学跃进呢？共产党有两件武器：一个是马克思列宁主义，一个是群众路线，依靠这两件武器可以领导一切。马克思列宁主义是一切科学之科学。党运用马克思列宁主义，可以最正确地认识人类社会的规律和自然界的规律。马克思列宁主义主张理论联系实际，脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合。这就使书本上的片面的知识变成完整的全面的知识。从全面知识出发再以辩证的观点来分析、判断，任何复杂的问题也都可以找出头绪来。因此，任何科学研究，都会比资产阶级学者专家，更快地得到正确的结论。不仅如此，党还充分依靠群众和发动群众，引导千百万群众向正确的方向进行探索，这就必然会更快地推动新的科学理论和发明创造的出现。方向对头，干劲鼓足，就可以高度地发挥人的主观能动性，推动社会生产力的发展，改造自然的面貌。我国农业生产大跃进，就对农业科学技术作出了巨大的理论贡献。这是共产党能够领导科学的最好的说明。最近几个月来，许多科学研究机关和高等学校，也兴起了科学事业的大跃进，不断地创造奇迹。许多过去连想都不敢想的事情，或者认为十年八年以后才能办的事情，在短短的几天或几十天内就完成了。这当然不是科学家的科学知识和技术本领突然增高起来了，而是因为贯彻了党的领导，政治挂了帅，破除了资产阶级思想，树立了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义思想。
    在科学事业的大跃进中，许多科学研究机关的基层党组织，成了指挥战斗的司令部。党组织集中了群众的智慧，分析情况，研究问题，出主意，想办法，组织和调动力量。大家团结在党的周围，形成一个战斗的集体，干劲十足，信心百倍，真是战无不胜，攻无不克。许多党组织的领导成员并不是科学技术上的内行，他们领导着各项科学的研究。他们在工作中经常发动群众进行讨论和辩论，全面地、正确地分析研究各种矛盾，找到问题的关键所在，并发动群众加以解决。有些科学家，亲身参加和经历了这样的事，才认识到：“党的领导最重要，政治是第一位的。”
    党对任何事业，向来是发动全党、全民来办的。但是资产阶级的科学家却认为群众运动的方法，不适用于科学研究工作。他们认为这样就会把事情搞乱，认为群众不懂科学，科学研究只能由少数人关在试验室里，冷冷清清、慢慢吞吞地去作。这样的论调必须加以肃清。为了贯彻科学技术工作中的群众路线，必须：第一，继续破除迷信，解放思想。不打破科学研究的神秘观念，不破除对外国、对书本和对专家的迷信，群众就发动不起来。第二，要专业的科学工作者同广大的工农群众相结合，提高与普及相结合。工农群众在长期的生产过程中积累了丰富的经验，特别是各行各业的工农业生产大跃进以来，他们有许多发明创造，出现了很多能手和专家。专业的科学工作者应该很好地同他们结合起来，向他们学习，同时又帮助他们从理论上加以总结、提高和推广。这样，普及和提高就可以很好地结合起来，群众的科学研究和发明创造可以得到理论的指导，科学的提高也有了现实的基础。第三，要土洋并举。我国的工农群众在长期的劳动生活中，创造了许多和自然作斗争的土办法，如当前大量出现的土农药、土化肥、土高炉，这些东西看来简单，其中也有着科学的道理，并且能适合中国的现实情况，解决生产中的大问题。我国富有悠久历史传统的中医、中药和农业生产中的丰富经验，在世界上都具有伟大的科学价值。对自己的土办法绝不可轻视，对外来的洋办法也不应迷信。洋办法只要是先进的，为我们所需要的，也应该尽量学习。第四，全党、全民动手，大办科学。科联、科普组织应该成为党发动群众大办科学的有力助手，要进一步在农村、厂矿、机关、学校广泛建立组织，发展会员，配合工农业生产大跃进，大力开展科学技术的宣传教育、研究、总结和推广工作，在全国人民中开展一个声势浩大的科学研究和技术革命运动。
    我们相信，经这次全国科学技术界代表人物的共同讨论，这项工作一定能大大开展起来。我们预祝大会的成功。
