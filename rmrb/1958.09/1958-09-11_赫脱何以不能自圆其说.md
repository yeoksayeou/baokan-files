Herter's Inability to Justify Himself
Du Bo

Following U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's blatant threat on the 4th to expand the scope of aggression against our country in the Taiwan Strait area and to carry out war provocations, U.S. Undersecretary of State Herter delivered a speech hostile to the Chinese people on the 5th. Herter's speech, like Dulles's statement, was absurd. He actually slandered the Chinese people's military actions to liberate their coastal islands as a "threat" to the United States, and shamelessly described the U.S. actions to expand aggression and interfere in China's internal affairs in the Taiwan Strait area as its "obligation." The theme of Herter's speech was so full of contradictions that he himself was completely unable to justify it.

When Herter wantonly attacked the Chinese people, he obviously deliberately obliterated the facts that could completely refute him. However, ironclad facts do not cease to exist because U.S. aggressors intentionally obliterate them. The most important fact is that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have always been Chinese territory, and the coastal islands of Jinmen and Mazu are even more islands within China's territorial waters; it is an exercise of national sovereignty and entirely China's internal affair for the Chinese people to liberate these territories of their own at any appropriate time and by any appropriate means. This is the sacred and inviolable right of the Chinese people. However, in order to divert the world's attention from the continued U.S. aggression in the Middle East and the delay in withdrawing troops from Lebanon, the United States has taken advantage of the Chinese government's resolute crackdown on and necessary military actions against the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on the coastal islands, who have been constantly carrying out harassment and sabotage activities. The U.S. has concentrated a large amount of armed aggressive forces in the Taiwan Strait area and openly threatened to expand its scope of aggression in the Taiwan Strait area to the coastal islands of Jinmen, Mazu, etc. Obviously, the military threats and war provocations carried out by the United States in the Taiwan Strait area are a heinous act of grossly interfering in our internal affairs and infringing upon our national sovereignty, and also a violation of the United Nations Charter and all basic norms of international law. Especially after our government clearly announced that our territorial sea is twelve nautical miles, U.S. warships have invaded our territorial sea within twelve nautical miles of the Jinmen and Xiamen areas, and its attempt to deliberately expand its scope of aggression against our country and carry out war provocations has become even more clearly exposed. Therefore, the tense situation and danger of war that exist in the Taiwan Strait area today are entirely created by the U.S. aggressors. In his speech, Herter actually slandered the Chinese people for "stirring up a new disturbing situation in the Taiwan Strait," which is the most shameless statement of completely reversing black and white.

The United States disregards UN resolutions, delays and refuses to withdraw its aggressive troops in Lebanon, and immediately gathers aggressive armed forces in the Taiwan Strait area of our country, provoking new dangers of war. This proves that U.S. imperialism is the greatest enemy of peace in Asia and the world. However, any war provocation by the United States will absolutely not intimidate the peace-loving Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world, and will only make them see the ferocious face of the U.S. aggressors more clearly, arousing their greater anger and more determined struggle.

In recent days, the large-scale rallies and demonstrations held by the people of our country in various places have expressed the common hatred of the 600 million people of our country for the U.S. criminal acts of expanding the scope of aggression and carrying out war provocations. Our people are full of confidence and determination to liberate their territory of Taiwan and all coastal islands, and to repel any foreign military interference and war provocations. Our people's struggle is just, so it can get the firm support of the Soviet people and the people of other countries in the socialist camp, and get the sympathy and support of the people and just public opinion of Asian, African and Latin American countries. Even the peace-loving people in Western aggressive countries such as the United States and Britain sympathize with our people. For example, the telegram sent by the U.S. Socialist Labor Party Campaign Committee to U.S. President Eisenhower strongly condemned the U.S. aggressive actions in the Taiwan Strait area, saying: "The presence of our (U.S.) troops on Chinese territory is a threat to world peace. We call for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Jinmen and Mazu and the sea around these islands to prevent the United States and the entire world from being drawn into World War III. We demand that the United States promise not to interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China." Obviously, the situation of the U.S. aggressors is becoming increasingly isolated. It is not only strongly condemned by the broad and just public opinion of the world, but also opposed by the people in the United States, and it does not get support within the Western imperialist camp. Up to now, the only ones who truly support the United States in carrying out military threats and war provocations in the Taiwan Strait area and are willing to sell their lives for the United States are the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan and the Syngman Rhee group in South Korea. And it is well known that the Chiang Kai-shek group and the Syngman Rhee group are completely slaves raised by U.S. imperialism, and they cannot exist at all without the support of U.S. bayonets. They cannot represent the people of Taiwan and the people of South Korea at all. However, in his speech, Herter actually greatly appreciated such a tool as the Syngman Rhee group, just like a person drowning in the sea grabbing a straw, and tried his best to incite the Syngman Rhee group to create trouble for the Chinese people and pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. This fully exposes the embarrassing situation of the United States being trapped in the quagmire of the Taiwan Strait and being unable to advance or retreat.

It is precisely because the U.S. situation is unprecedentedly isolated that some people in the U.S. ruling group are now trying their best to spread the cliches of the so-called "communist threat," distort the situation in Asia and the world, slander the Chinese people, and provoke the relations between Asian countries and China. Herter's speech is an example. Herter obviously felt that the U.S. aggressive actions in the Taiwan Strait area have caused unfavorable reactions among Asian countries; in order to cover up U.S. aggression and provoke the unity of Asian countries, he actually slandered the necessary military actions taken by the Chinese people against their coastal islands as "threatening" "the newly established countries in Southeast Asia." Herter didn't think about it, how could the actions of the Chinese people on their own territory threaten Southeast Asia? If Herter's slander against the Chinese people is believed, then what would the people of Asian countries think of the United States sending a large number of aggressive armed forces to Asia, more than 10,000 kilometers away from U.S. territory, and stationing them in various parts of Asia for a long time?

Herter's speech proves that it is not others who truly threaten Southeast Asia and the entire Asia, but the U.S. aggressors themselves. Herter openly stated that the United States is determined to "maintain a sufficiently strong" military force in Asia to "help free countries in the Far East achieve internal security and political stability." Why would the internal security and political stability of Asian countries require the uninvited "help" of the United States? And why must the United States station a "sufficiently strong" military force on the territory of other countries? Doesn't this precisely illustrate the ambition of U.S. imperialism to continue to invade Asian countries? As for Herter's so-called nonsense that the United States wants to help Asian countries "promote the improvement of the living conditions of their people," just look at the economic crisis and unemployment in Japan, and the economic difficulties in South Korea, Turkey, and other Asian countries that receive the most "U.S. aid," and you will fully know what Herter is talking about. Herter's words are simply deceiving.

Holding a gun in one hand and a dollar in the other; making false threats on the one hand and sweet words on the other. These are precisely the two sets of magic weapons used by U.S. aggressors to deal with all nationally independent countries. Herter still wants these two sets of magic weapons. The Asian people have long seen through these tricks of the U.S. aggressors, so put them away as soon as possible!

    赫脱何以不能自圆其说
    杜波
    在美国国务卿杜勒斯4日公然威胁要在台湾海峡地区扩大对我国的侵略范围、进行战争挑衅的声明之后，美国副国务卿赫脱5日又发表了一篇敌视中国人民的演说。赫脱的演说，像杜勒斯的声明一样荒谬，他竟然诬蔑中国人民解放自己沿海岛屿的军事行动为“威胁”了美国，而无耻地把美国在台湾海峡地区扩大侵略和干涉中国内政的行动说成是它的“义务”。赫脱演说的主题是这样地充满了矛盾，以至他自己完全无法自圆其说。
    赫脱在肆意攻击中国人民的时候，他显然故意抹煞了还有能够完全驳倒他的事实存在。然而铁的事实并不因美国侵略者的有意抹煞就不存在了。最重要的事实是：台湾和澎湖列岛历来就是中国的领土，金门、马祖等沿海岛屿更是属于中国大陆领海内的岛屿；中国人民在任何适当的时候采取任何适当的方法解放自己的这些领土，都是行使国家的主权，完全是中国的内政。这是中国人民神圣不可侵犯的权利。可是，美国为了转移世界人民对于美国在中东地区继续侵略、拖延自黎巴嫩撤军的注意力，竟利用中国政府对盘据在沿海岛屿上不断进行骚扰破坏活动的蒋介石部队采取坚决的打击和必要的军事行动的时候，在台湾海峡地区大量集中武装侵略力量，公开威胁要把它在台湾海峡地区的侵略范围扩大到金门、马祖等沿海岛屿。很明显，美国在台湾海峡地区所进行的军事威胁和战争挑衅，是粗暴地干涉我国内政，侵犯我国主权的罪恶行为，也是对联合国宪章和一切国际法基本准则的破坏。特别是在我国政府明确宣布我国的领海为十二海里以后，美国军舰竟侵入我国金门、厦门地区的领海十二海里以内进行活动，它蓄意扩大对我国的侵略范围和进行战争挑衅的企图就更加暴露得清楚了。因此，台湾海峡地区今天存在的紧张形势和战争危险，完全是美国侵略者一手制造出来的。赫脱在他的演说中，竟然诬蔑中国人民“在台湾海峡方面煽动新的令人不安的局面”，这是完全颠倒黑白的最无耻的说法。
    美国蔑视联合国的决议，拖延和不肯撤退在黎巴嫩的侵略军，立刻又在我国台湾海峡地区集结侵略武装力量，挑动新的战争危险，这证明美帝国主义是亚洲和世界和平的最大敌人。然而，美国的任何战争挑衅，绝对吓不倒爱好和平的中国人民和世界各国人民，并且只会使他们更加看清美国侵略者的凶恶嘴脸，激起他们更大的愤怒和更坚定的斗争决心。
    这几天来，我国各地人民所举行的声势浩大的集会游行示威，表示了我国六亿人民对美国扩大侵略范围和进行战争挑衅的罪恶行为的同仇敌忾。我国人民充满着信心和决心要解放自己的领土台湾和一切沿海岛屿，打退任何外来的军事干涉和战争挑衅。我国人民的斗争是正义的，因此能够得到苏联人民和社会主义阵营其他各国人民的坚定支持，得到亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民和公正舆论的同情和支持。就是美英等西方侵略国家里的爱好和平的人民，也都是同情我国人民的。比如美国统一独立社会党竞选委员会打给美国总统艾森豪威尔的电报里，就十分愤慨地谴责了美国在台湾海峡地区的侵略行动，它说：“我们（美国）的军队驻在中国领土上是对全世界和平的威胁。我们呼吁立即从金门和马祖以及这些岛屿四周的海面上撤出美国军队，以防止把美国和整个世界卷入第三次世界大战。我们要求美国答应不再干涉中华人民共和国的内政。”显然，美国侵略者的处境已经越来越孤立。它不仅遭到全世界广大公正舆论的强烈谴责，也遭到美国国内人民的反对，并在西方帝国主义阵营内部也得不到支持。到现在为止，真正支持美国在台湾海峡地区进行军事威胁和战争挑衅的，愿意为美国卖命的，还只有台湾的蒋介石集团和南朝鲜的李承晚集团。而人所共知，蒋介石集团和李承晚集团完全是美帝国主义豢养的奴才，它们离了美国刺刀的支持就根本不能存在，完全不能代表台湾人民和南朝鲜人民。可是，赫脱在他的演说中，对李承晚集团这样一个工具居然大加赏识，正像一个沉溺在大海里的人抓住一根稻草一样，竭力煽动李承晚集团对中国人民进行捣乱，为美国火中取栗。这充分暴露了美国陷在台湾海峡泥淖中进退两难的尴尬处境。
    正是由于美国的处境空前孤立，美国统治集团的一些人士现在正在竭力散布所谓“共产主义威胁”的陈词滥调，歪曲亚洲和世界的局势，诬蔑中国人民，挑拨亚洲国家同中国的关系。赫脱的演说就是一个例子。赫脱显然感觉到美国在台湾海峡地区的侵略行动，在亚洲国家中引起了不利于美国的反响；他为了掩饰美国的侵略，挑拨亚洲国家的团结，居然诬蔑中国人民对自己沿海岛屿所采取的必要军事行动，“威胁”了“东南亚新成立的各国”。赫脱没有想一想，中国人民在自己领土上的行动，怎么有可能威胁到东南亚呢？如果赫脱对中国人民的这种诬蔑有人相信的话，那末，美国把大批侵略武装调到离美国领土一万多公里的亚洲来，并且长期驻扎在亚洲各地，亚洲国家人民会作何感想呢？
    赫脱的演说证明，真正威胁东南亚和整个亚洲的不是旁人，正是美国侵略者自己。赫脱公开声言，美国决心要在亚洲“保持一个足够强大的”军事力量，以“帮助远东自由国家获得内部安全和政治稳定”。亚洲国家的内部安全和政治稳定，为什么会要美国不请自来的“帮助”呢？而且为什么美国非要驻一支“足够强大的”军事力量在别人的国土上不可呢？这不恰恰说明了美帝国主义决心继续侵略亚洲国家的野心吗？至于赫脱所谓美国要帮助亚洲国家“促进它们人民生活条件的改善”的鬼话，只要看看日本的经济危机和失业情况，看看南朝鲜、土耳其以及其它接受“美援”最多的亚洲国家经济困难的情景，就完全知道赫脱所说的究竟是怎么一回事了。赫脱的话根本就是骗人的。
    一手拿枪，一手拿美元；一面虚声恫吓，一面甜言蜜语，这正是美国侵略者对付一切民族独立国家的两套法宝。赫脱要的也还是这两套法宝。亚洲人民老早就看穿了美国侵略者的这些伎俩，还是早点收起来吧！
