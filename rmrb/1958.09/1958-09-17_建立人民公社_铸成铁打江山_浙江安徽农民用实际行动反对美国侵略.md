Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 16th: The peasants of Zhejiang Province are enthusiastically launching the people's commune movement, using practical actions to strike back against the military provocations of American imperialism.

Many peasants said that with the establishment of people's communes, which combine workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants into one, our country will be an ironclad state. If the enemy dares to invade, we will make them bleed! They have written letters of determination and big-character posters, and have been celebrating the arrival of the high tide of people's communization by beating drums and gongs. The people's commune movement is developing rapidly throughout the province. Now Zhuji and Xindeng counties have fully realized people's communization, and other counties are also actively and systematically carrying out this movement.

"Produce more grain, produce more steel, fiercely strike the American wolves!" "We have people, we have grain!" These are the resounding slogans put forward by the members of the people's communes in various places. After the establishment of the Red Flag People's Commune in Zhuji County, it has begun to build large-scale basic construction projects that the original agricultural cooperatives were unable to undertake, such as building large reservoirs and reclaiming large tracts of wasteland. They said that they would use these practical actions to smash the provocations of American imperialism. At the founding meeting of the Xuguang People's Commune, the secretary of the Da Xi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a report on the current situation and on running the people's commune well. The commune members held discussions and wrote more than 1,450 big-character posters, unanimously expressing their determination to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions of running the commune well and doing a good job in production. The Zhoushan Islands have now established nine people's communes. The fishermen who have joined the communes have changed their autumn rest habits and are all participating in autumn fishing production. Motorized sailing boats and large fishing boats have also ventured to the Bohai Sea to open up new fishing grounds. At the same time as their intense labor, the militias of the people's communes in various places have stepped up their military training. The militiamen of the Guangming People's Commune in Yanshan Township, Lanxi County, said that they are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and give the American aggressors a resolute blow.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 16th: The peasants of Anhui Province are responding to the military provocations of American imperialism by launching a new upsurge in production and actively participating in people's communes. At present, more than 400 people's communes have been established in the province. Many agricultural cooperative members have submitted applications to the agricultural cooperatives requesting the establishment of people's communes at rallies to oppose American aggression. All 280,000 agricultural cooperative members in Quanjiao County have requested to join the people's commune before the 20th of this month, so that the entire county can realize people's communization.

The slogan of the agricultural cooperative members is: "Realize communization, double production." After the establishment of the people's commune, the enthusiasm of the commune members for production became even more vigorous. In one day, the Changlinhe People's Commune in Feidong County mobilized more than 28,100 people to carry out a crash program to apply fertilizer and weed, eliminating third-class seedlings from more than 8,000 mu of late autumn crops. Within seven days of the establishment of the Jianghuai People's Commune in the suburban area of Hefei City, each laborer accumulated an average of 5,500 dan of fertilizer.

The superiority of the commune is evident as soon as it is established. When the Changlinhe People's Commune in Feidong County was rushing to harvest mid-season rice, it organized large-scale cooperation in the Gangwei area, transferring more than 6,000 laborers from the Gang area, and rushing to harvest 41,000 mu of mid-season rice in two days, seven days earlier than in previous years. The original Jiaotong and Dajing agricultural cooperatives in the suburban area of Hefei City were unable to purchase chemical fertilizers due to a lack of production funds, and they were not adequately prepared with good seeds for autumn planting. Now, after merging with several agricultural cooperatives with more public accumulation to form the Jianghuai People's Commune, the commune has allocated 5,300 yuan to support them in buying chemical fertilizers and seeds. Within seven days of its establishment, the Shuguang People's Commune in Guoyang County built 3,500 various factories, manufactured 10,250 sets of ball bearings, produced more than 27 million jin of native fertilizer, and more than 110,000 jin of native cement. The Dongfeng People's Commune in Feidong County built 24 small blast furnaces and has already smelted 350 tons of iron. The Shucha People's Commune in Shucheng County has more than 8,000 households, and within ten days, it established 30 factories and organized 18 professional mineral prospecting teams. The establishment of people's communes has further liberated the rural women's labor force and promoted the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. After the establishment of the Shucha People's Commune in Shucheng County, it has established a total of 75 Red and Expert Schools, agricultural middle schools, and primary schools, with more than 6,200 students enrolled, doubling the number of students enrolled before the establishment of the commune. At the same time, it has also established 51 public canteens, kindergartens, sewing factories, etc., so that more than 6,200 women in the commune have been freed from housework and have participated in field production.

    建立人民公社　铸成铁打江山
    浙江安徽农民用实际行动反对美国侵略
    新华社杭州16日电　浙江省农民热烈开展人民公社运动，以实际行动回击美帝国主义的军事挑衅。
    许多农民说，办了人民公社，工农兵学商结合一体，我们的国家就是铁打江山，敌人敢来侵犯，就让它碰得头破血流。他们纷纷写决心书、大字报，敲锣打鼓地迎接人民公社化高潮的到来。浦江县清山乡一位白发苍苍的老社员也吹着喇叭，走了三十里路到区委送决心书。全省人民公社运动发展很快，现在诸暨、新登两县已经全部实现了人民公社化，其他各县也正在积极地有步骤地开展这一运动。
    “多产粮食多出钢，狠狠打击美国狼！”“要人有人，要粮有粮！” 这是各地人民公社社员们提出的响亮口号。诸暨县红旗人民公社建立起来以后，已开始兴建原来农业社无力兴建的大型基本建设，如搞大水库，开垦大片荒地等，他们表示要以这些实际行动来粉碎美帝国主义的挑衅。在旭光人民公社成立大会上，中共大西区委员会书记作了关于目前形势和办好人民公社的报告，社员们进行了讨论，并写了一千四百五十多张大字报，一致表示以办好公社、搞好生产的实际行动来支援解放台湾的斗争。舟山群岛目前已成立了九个人民公社，参加公社的渔民们改变了歇秋习惯，个个参加秋汛生产，机帆船、大捕船还远征到渤海开辟新渔场。各地人民公社的民兵在紧张劳动的同时，都加紧了军事训练。兰溪县岩山乡光明人民公社的民兵们表示，准备随时响应祖国的号召，给美国侵略者以坚决的打击。
    新华社合肥16日电　安徽省农民正以掀起新的生产高潮和踊跃参加人民公社的实际行动来回答美帝国主义的军事挑衅。目前全省已办起人民公社四百多个。很多农业社员在参加反对美国侵略的集会上，向农业社呈递了要求办人民公社的申请书。全椒县二十八万农业社员都要求在本月20日以前加入人民公社，使全县实现人民公社化。
    农业社员们的口号是：“实现公社化，生产翻一番。”人民公社建立起来以后，社员的生产干劲更加旺盛。肥东县长临河人民公社在一天当中就发动二万八千一百多人突击追肥除草，消灭了八千多亩晚秋作物的三类苗。合肥市郊区江淮人民公社建立后的七天内，每个劳动力平均积肥五千五百担。
    公社一建立就显示出了它的优越性。肥东县长临河人民公社在抢收中稻时，组织岗圩大协作，从岗区调了六千多劳动力，突击两天收割完四万一千亩中稻，比往年提前了七天。合肥市郊区原交通、大井两个农业社，因为生产资金缺乏，无力购买化学肥料，秋种良种也没有准备充足。现在和公共积累比较多的几个农业社合办成江淮人民公社后，公社就抽出五千三百元支持他们买化肥、种子。涡阳县曙光人民公社在办社七天内，新建了各种工厂三千五百个，制造滚珠轴承一万零二百五十套，生产土化肥二千七百多万斤，土水泥十一万多斤。肥东县东风人民公社建成二十四座小高炉，已炼铁三百五十吨。舒城县舒茶人民公社有八千多户，十天内就办起三十个工厂，并组织了十八个专业找矿队。人民公社的建立还进一步解放了农村妇女劳动力，促进了技术革命和文化革命。舒城县舒茶人民公社建立后，已办了红专学校、农业中学、小学共七十五所，入学学生六千二百多人，比办公社前入学人数增加了一倍。同时还建立了五十一个公共食堂、幼儿园、缝衣厂等，使全社六千二百多名妇女从家务中摆脱出来，参加了田间生产。
