On the night of September 9th, people were sleeping peacefully. Freight dispatchers were all energetic, their eyes wide open, concentrating intently on directing the loading and unloading of one more freight car almost every minute and every second: “This train will arrive at your station ahead of schedule, make preparations for unloading as soon as possible….” From their smiling faces, it could be seen that the responses on the phone were satisfactory to them. That night, the stations of Jilin, Hadawan, Jilin North, Jiuzhan, Yanji, Longjing, Tumen, and Kaishantun not only unloaded four hundred and four loaded cars, but also loaded four hundred and thirty-seven cars of goods.

Zhang Shiying and others who came to take over the shift, seeing that the previous shift had laid such a beautiful foundation for them, were even more enthusiastic. As soon as they took over, duty officers Hao Jinshan, Guo Zhongjian, and others stepped up, and Liu Congzheng, deputy director of the Transportation Department, also rushed over. Their common feeling was: load as much as possible.

Song Shoulin, the dispatcher at the Jiao-Tai line, discovered that a batch of empty cars were available at Jilin Station, and immediately discussed with Jilin Station to quickly dispatch them and organize Tiangang Station to load more cars. Freight dispatcher Zheng Wenxi organized Dongfeng Station to quickly unload the arrived loaded cars, and after unloading, they immediately loaded two more cars of goods…

Look! This is another scene of battle. Eight empty cars arrived at Dashitou Station at 4:00 PM. As soon as the cars arrived, the loading workers carried goods into the cars. Hu Benchang, the director of the operation section, and Zhang Kun, the weigher, took off their shirts and worked alongside the workers. Before 6:00 PM, all the goods on the eight cars were loaded.

As a result, although the number of cars loaded reported to the ministry in the morning had been revised twice, it still lagged behind the actual amount.

At the shift handover meeting, everyone was summarizing their work when duty officer Wang Shaoguo ran over to tell everyone: "Good news, today the entire bureau's car loading has released a 'satellite,' loading ninety-seven cars more than planned, and the turnaround time has been shortened by 0.06 days compared to the plan."

    战斗之夜
    吉林铁路局　丘启均
    9月9日深夜，人们都安静地入睡了。货运调度员个个精神抖擞，眼睛瞪得溜圆，几乎每分每秒都在为多装卸一车货而聚精会神地指挥着：“这趟车提前到你站，趁早做好卸车准备……。”从他们微笑的脸上，可以看出，电话中的回声是使他们满意的。这一宿，吉林、哈达湾、吉林北、九站、延吉、龙井、图们、开山屯等站，不但卸下了四百零四辆重车，还装了四百三十七车货物。
    来接班的张士英等，一瞧上一班给他们打了很漂亮的底，情绪更高了。刚接班，值班员郝金山、郭忠俭等就上台了，车务处副处长刘从正也赶到了，他们共同的心情是：尽量多装。
    吉蛟台调度员宋守林，发现吉林站倒出一批空车，马上和吉林站商量快挂走，组织天岗站多装车；货运调度员郑文喜；组织东丰站利用到达的重车快卸，卸完就手又装了两车货……。
    看！这是另一个战斗的场面。十六点到大石头站八辆空车，车一到，装车工人就往车里扛上货物了，作业所主任胡本昌、司磅员张昆，脱下了上衣，和工人一块儿干起来，还没到十八点，八辆车的货件统统装上了。
    这一来，早晨向部里预报的装车数虽然修改了两次，仍然是落后于实际了。
    退班会上，大家正在总结工作，值班员王绍国跑来向大家说：“好消息，今天全局装车放出一颗‘卫星’，比计划多装九十七车，周转时间比计划缩短零点零六天。”
