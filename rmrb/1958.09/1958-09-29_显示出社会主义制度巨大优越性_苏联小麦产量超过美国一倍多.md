Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch: The Soviet "Agricultural Newspaper" today cited materials indicating that from 1954 to 1957, the Soviet Union's total agricultural output increased by an average of 7.1% per year, while the United States only increased by 1.1%. The newspaper pointed out that the large-scale socialist agricultural production of the Soviet Union has a decisive superiority, and the Soviet people have fundamentally changed the face of rural production and life.

According to materials published in the newly published statistical compilation "The Soviet Union in Figures," in the eleven years before the war (1930 to 1940) and the twelve years after the war (1946 to 1957), the average annual growth rate of total agricultural output in the Soviet Union was 4.3%, while in the United States it was 1.2%.

Soviet wheat production is constantly increasing, but wheat production in many capitalist countries is shrinking. In 1957, the total harvest of wheat in the Soviet Union was equivalent to 140% of that in 1953, while the United States was 81% and Canada was 61%. The Soviet Union has more than doubled the United States in terms of wheat production.

The average yield of cotton per hectare in the Soviet Union in 1957 was 20.8 quintals, while in capitalist countries it was 7.4 quintals. The output of other crops in the Soviet Union has also increased greatly.

Due to the increase in agricultural labor productivity, the proportion of the agricultural population in the Soviet Union has decreased by nearly half compared with before the October Revolution, while the amount of commercial agricultural products has now increased several times.

A survey of the income and expenditure of collective farm families shows that the consumption of major food items per capita in 1957 increased significantly compared with before the revolution, with meat and fats increasing by 1.3 times, sugar increasing by nearly 2.5 times, and milk and dairy products increasing by 1.7 times. The taxes paid by collective farmers now account for less than 4% of their agricultural income.

In 1957, the cash income obtained by collective farms from selling agricultural products increased by 1.2 times compared with 1952.

Now, every collective farm has an agronomist or livestock breeder. Due to the reorganization of machine tractor stations, the number of experts in collective farms has greatly increased.

The amount of technical equipment in collective farms and state farms is increasing significantly every year. In 1957, agricultural electricity consumption increased ninefold compared with 1940 before the war.

In 1957, the sown area in the Soviet Union increased by 75.5 million hectares compared with 1913. The increased area alone is equal to more than half of the total sown area of the United States.

    显示出社会主义制度巨大优越性
    苏联小麦产量超过美国一倍多
    新华社26日讯  据塔斯社报道：苏联“农业报”今天引用的材料表明，在1954年到1957年，苏联农业总产量每年平均增长了7.1％，而美国只增长了1.1％。报纸指出，苏联社会主义农业大生产具有决定意义的优越性，苏联人民已经根本改变农村生产和生活的面貌。
    据新出版的统计资料汇编“从数字看苏联”所公布的材料，在战前十一年（1930年到1940年）和战后十二年（1946年到1957年）的时期中，苏联农业总产量每年平均增长速度为4.3％，而美国是1.2％。
    苏联小麦的生产在不断增加，可是许多资本主义国家的小麦生产却在缩减。1957年苏联的小麦总收获量相当于1953年的140％，而美国为81％，加拿大为61％。苏联在小麦产量方面已经超过美国一倍多。
    苏联每公顷棉花的平均收获量1957年是二十点八公担，而资本主义国家是七点四公担。苏联的其他农作物的产量也大大增加了。
    由于农业劳动生产率的提高，苏联农业人口的比重比十月革命前差不多减少了一半，而商品农产品现在却增加了几倍。
    对集体农民家庭的收支情况调查表明，1957年按人口计算的主要食品的消费量比革命前显著增加了，其中肉和油脂增加了一点三倍，糖差不多增加二倍半，牛奶和奶制品增加一点七倍。现在集体农民所缴纳的捐税占不到他们农业收入的4％。
    1957年各集体农庄出售农产品而获得的现金收入，比1952年增加了一点二倍。
    现在，每一个集体农庄都有农艺师或牲畜饲养家。由于改组机器拖拉机站，集体农庄的专家人数大大增加了。
    各集体农庄和国营农场的技术装备量每年都大量增加。1957年农业的电力消费量比战前1940年增加了九倍。
    1957年苏联的播种面积比1913年增加了七千五百五十万公顷。单是所增加的这些面积，就等于美国全国播种面积的一半以上。
