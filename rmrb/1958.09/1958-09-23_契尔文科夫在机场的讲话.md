Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd. The full text of the speech by Chervenkov, head of the Bulgarian National Assembly delegation, at Beijing Airport is as follows:

    Our dear comrades and friends:

    We, the envoys of the Bulgarian National Assembly, set foot on Chinese soil with extremely excited hearts. No matter how far this land is from our motherland, it is a dear land to our people. On this land, 600 million Chinese people live, fight, and achieve victory under the long-tested leadership of their wise Communist Party. With the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, the Chinese people are overcoming inevitable difficulties and advancing from victory to victory on the road of socialism. The working people of Bulgaria and their Communist Party are excitedly watching the astonishing surge of the Chinese people in terms of the scale, speed, and unique forms of socialist construction. This surge of the Chinese people has a beneficial and enormous effect on human progress. Our people also feel sincere and heartfelt joy for this surge.

    Dear friends and comrades, we are honored to be able to convey to you the warm and heartfelt congratulations of our people and to express our people's infinite respect and true brotherly friendship for you. The source of the unity of our two peoples is: the commonality of our interests, our loyalty to Lenin's principles of internationalism, and our complete belonging to the camp of peace and socialism headed by the great and invincible Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

    We express our infinite gratitude to the National People's Congress for inviting us to visit your vast and boundless country, full of infinite strength and potential. Please accept the sincere gratitude of our National Assembly.

    We are coming to your country on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the founding of People's China. We have come with an earnest desire to see with our own eyes the increasingly great achievements you have made in socialist construction, to learn from these achievements, and to learn from your diverse experiences.

    We are coming to your country for a friendly visit at a time when the American imperialists and their Chiang Kai-shek running dogs are carrying out shameless provocations in the Taiwan Strait, threatening world peace. I would like to express here also the Bulgarian people's full support for the just cause of the People's Republic of China. This cause will surely triumph, and the sinister conspiracies of the enemies of peace will surely be shattered. The East Wind will surely prevail over the West Wind.

    Comrades and friends!

    For the joy and encouragement of the peoples of all countries, and for the reactionaries—the planners and instigators of new wars—to tremble, may the People's Republic of China be filled with new and even more powerful strength!

    May the invincible peace forces of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union grow stronger day by day!

    We believe that our delegation's visit will contribute to the consolidation of Bulgarian-Chinese friendship. Long live the consolidation of Bulgarian-Chinese friendship!

    契尔文科夫在机场的讲话
    新华社22日讯　保加利亚国民议会代表团团长契尔文科夫在北京机场上的讲话，全文如下：我们亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我们，保加利亚国民议会的使者，以极其激动的心情踏上了中国的土地。这块土地不管离我们祖国多么远，它对我国人民来说都是一块亲切的土地。在这块土地上，六万万中国人民在自己英明的共产党的久经考验的领导下生活着，战斗着，并且正在取得胜利。中国人民以大跃进的精神，克服着不可避免的困难，在社会主义的大道上正从胜利走向胜利。保加利亚的劳动人民和他们的共产党，兴奋地注视着中国人民在社会主义建设的规模、速度和形式独特方面都是惊人的高涨。中国人民的这一高涨给予人类进步的作用是良好的、巨大的。我国人民也为这一高涨感到真诚的、亲切的高兴。
    亲爱的朋友们和同志们，我们能向你们转达我国人民热烈的、出自内心的祝贺，表达我国人民对你们的无限敬意和真正的兄弟友谊，感到荣幸。我们两国人民的团结一致的源泉是：我们利益的共同性、我们对列宁的国际主义原则的忠诚和我们完全属于以伟大的无敌的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟为首的和平和社会主义阵营。
    我们对全国人民代表大会邀请我们访问你们广阔无限的、充满无限力量和潜力的国家，表示无限感谢。请接受我国国民议会对此的衷心谢意。
    我们是在人民中国成立九周年的前夕来到你们国家的。我们是怀着亲眼看看你们在社会主义建设中取得的日益巨大的成就、学习这些成就和学习你们多样的经验的殷切愿望而来的。
    我们是在美国帝国主义者和他们的蒋介石走狗在台湾海峡进行厚颜无耻的挑衅，威胁世界和平的时刻来到你们国家进行友好访问的。我愿在这里也表示保加利亚人民完全支持中华人民共和国的正义事业。这一事业一定胜利，和平的敌人的居心险恶的阴谋一定被粉碎。东风一定压倒西风。同志们和朋友们！
    为了让各国人民欢欣鼓舞，为了让反动派——新战争的策划者和煽动者发抖，愿中华人民共和国充满新的、更加强大的力量！
    愿以苏联为首的社会主义阵营无敌的和平力量一天比一天强大！
    我们相信我们代表团的访问将为巩固保中友谊作出贡献。保中友谊巩固万岁！
