　　The county is building a steel mill! The infrastructure construction started three days ago, and today we are using Mao bamboo to build scaffolding for the blast furnace. Early in the morning, before the sun had risen, Wang Kaifa, a worker at the construction site, took more than thirty residents to carry Mao bamboo. The Mao bamboo was transported by truck, but because the road leading to the construction site had not yet been repaired, the Mao bamboo had to be unloaded in an open space about half a kilometer from the construction site.

　　Looking up at the pile of Mao bamboo that looked like a mountain, someone excitedly said: "Let's carry it all away!"

　　"I knew I was coming to the steel mill for voluntary labor today, so I saved up my energy yesterday. We guarantee to carry it all away!" a tall young woman said confidently.

　　Wang Kaifa was not so sure. He thought, more than thirty residents, mostly women, how could they carry so much Mao bamboo in one day?

　　However, as soon as the women heard the order, they picked up the Mao bamboo and ran. At first, each person carried one, but later, the young and strong women rolled up their sleeves and carried two. They shouted and laughed all the way, chasing each other, and passers-by hurriedly stepped aside to make way.

　　This is a main road from the county seat to the northern districts and townships, with a constant stream of pedestrians. The passers-by saw the residents' charging momentum and the labor mood like singing a hymn, and they were envious. A fat pedestrian asked his companion in surprise: "What are so many people carrying Mao bamboo for in such a hurry?"

　　Before his companion could answer, the tall young woman, carrying two large Mao bamboo, interjected with a hearty laugh: "Hey! Don't you know yet? Our county is building a steel mill, carrying Mao bamboo to build scaffolding for the blast furnace!"

　　"Really? Where is it being built?" The fat man leaned over and asked eagerly and excitedly.

　　"Just ahead, you'll pass it on your way!" the tall young woman replied, holding the Mao bamboo tightly on her shoulders, shouting: "Hey! Hurry up ahead!" and flew away with excitement.

　　"Ha yo!" The fat man looked at the tall woman's back with admiring eyes and shouted happily: "The steel mill is being built right in front of my eyes, and I didn't even know it? Go! Go! Let's carry two along the way!" Saying that, he grabbed his companion, turned around and walked to the Mao bamboo pile, picked the biggest two and followed the residents, "humming and hawing."

　　Two farmers were standing by the road, watching the fat man carrying the long Mao bamboo, running so fast that the muscles all over his body were trembling, and couldn't help but praised: "What great strength!"

　　"Building a steel mill, how can we not be energetic?"

　　"Oh! Building a steel mill! Let's go carry a few too!" one of the farmers said happily.

　　So, the two farmers picked up the Mao bamboo, straddled their thick, sturdy black legs, and stared at the fat man's broad back, chasing after him.

　　At this time, all the passers-by were moved, and one by one they picked up the Mao bamboo, even a little old woman with bound feet carried one.

　　Before ten o'clock, the pile of Mao bamboo like a mountain was all gone.

    背毛竹
    洪金
    县里办炼钢厂了！三天前开始了基建工作，今天是用毛竹搭高炉的脚手架。一清早，太阳还没升起，工地工作人员王开法带了三十多个居民去背毛竹。毛竹是用汽车载来的，因为通向工地的路还没有修好，所以只得把毛竹卸在离工地一里路外的空地上。
    仰头望着堆得像一座山似的毛竹，有人兴奋地说：“背完它！”
    “我晓得今天要到炼钢厂来义务劳动，昨天就养足气力，我们保证全部背完！”一个高个子的年轻妇女满有把握地说。
    王开法可没有把握。他想，三十多个居民，大半是妇女，一天之内怎么背得完这么多的毛竹？
    可是，妇女们一听命令，背起毛竹就跑。先是一人背一根，后来年轻力壮的妇女们卷起袖口背两根，一路上?喝着，你追我，我赶你，慌得过路人急忙闪在旁边让路。
    这是一条由县城通到北区各乡的要道，来往行人络绎不绝。行人看见居民们打冲锋一样的劲儿和唱欢歌一样的劳动情绪，羡慕得眼红了。一个胖胖的行人，诧异地问同伴：“许多人慌慌忙忙的背毛竹做啥去？”
    同伴还没回答，那个高个子年轻妇女背着两根大毛竹，笑声朗朗的插嘴说：“嗨！你还勿晓得？我们县里建炼钢厂了，背毛竹去搭架子造高炉呀！”
    “真的？造在哪里？”胖子探过身去，急切兴奋地问。
    “就在前面，你们走路要经过的！”高个子年轻妇女回答，两手抱紧两肩上的毛竹，喝一声：“嗳！前面的走快呀！”兴冲冲的飞也似地去了。
    “哈唷！”胖子用赞美的眼光望着高个子妇女的背影，欢嚷起来：“炼钢厂造到眼面前来了，我还勿晓得呢？去！去！我们也顺路背两根！”说着，拉住他的同伴，返转身走到毛竹堆旁，拣最大的背了两根，“哼哼呵呵”的跟着居民们走。
    路边站着两个过路的农民，眼看胖子背着长毛竹，飞奔得浑身筋肉颤颤抖抖，禁不住赞了一声：“好大的劲！”
    “造炼钢厂啦，还不来劲吗？”
    “哦！造炼钢厂啦！我们也去背几根！”一个农民高兴地说。
    于是，两个农民背起毛竹，跨开粗健的黑腿，眼睛盯着胖子宽大的背影直追。
    这时，所有过路人都动了心，一个个都背起毛竹来，连一个小脚老太婆也背了一根。
    不到十点钟。大山似的一堆毛竹一根也不剩了。
