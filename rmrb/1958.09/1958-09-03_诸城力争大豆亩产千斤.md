Dazhong Daily News: Zhucheng County, Shandong Province, is comprehensively strengthening the field management of soybeans to ensure a soybean yield of 1,000 jin per mu.

The 300,000 mu of soybeans in the county are generally growing well, especially the "satellite" fields, which are growing even more vigorously. The stalks of the best fields are already two and a half chi high. In order to strengthen field management and strive to become a "Soybean Marshal County," soybean field management leading groups have been established from the county to the township levels. Most of the communes have also established specialized management groups, implemented a responsibility system, promoted the method of contracting work to households, to individuals, and to fields, and launched red flag competitions. The thirty agricultural cooperatives in Linjia Village Township have established a soybean professional management army of more than 4,800 people, implementing a system of contracting areas, weeding where there is grass, and eliminating pests where there are pests. The township's more than 4,400 mu of soybeans have generally been hoed, fertilized one to three times, watered one to two times, and treated for pests once. Recently, the county party committee proposed new measures, requiring that each mu of soybeans be fertilized with another 20,000 to 30,000 jin on the existing basis, and that pesticides be sprayed one to two times to completely remove dodder and ensure the normal growth of soybeans.

　　诸城力争大豆亩产千斤
    本报讯　大众日报消息：山东省诸城县正全面加强大豆田间管理，保证大豆亩产一千斤。
    这个县三十万亩大豆普遍生长良好，特别是“卫星”田生长更为旺盛，好的秸高已达二尺半。为了加强田间管理，争取实现大豆元帅县，最近从县到乡普遍成立了大豆田间管理领导小组，而各社也大部分成立了管理专业小组，建立了责任制，推行了包工到户、到人、到田的办法，开展了红旗竞赛。这个县林家村乡的三十处农业社，成立了四千八百多人的大豆专业管理大军，实行分片包干，有草除草，有虫除虫。全乡四千四百多亩大豆，目前已普遍修锄、追肥一至三遍，水浇一至两遍，治虫一遍。最近，县委又提出了新的措施，要求在现有基础上每亩大豆再追肥二至三万斤，普遍喷打一至两遍农药，并要求彻底拔除菟丝，保证大豆正常生长。
