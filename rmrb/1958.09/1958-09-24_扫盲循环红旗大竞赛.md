Mass Literacy Red Flag Emulation Campaign

In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, forty-nine counties with a concentration of Zhuang people have launched a heated Zhuang language literacy red flag emulation campaign. Luocheng County took the lead and achieved the goal of becoming a county without illiteracy. Shuilong, Donglan, and ten other counties closely followed and basically completed the literacy task. In just over a month, the number of people enrolled in literacy classes surged from more than 1.3 million to more than 2.4 million, and the number of people who became literate increased from more than 300,000 to more than 1.2 million.

In the areas where illiteracy has been eliminated, the people's cultural level has improved, directly promoting production. After Da'an Yao Autonomous County's Daxing District became an illiteracy-free area, all production teams set up work assignment boards, writing the daily farm work types and task requirements in the Zhuang language. The commune members would read them and record them on their personal small blackboards. Many commune members were already able to record their own work points.

Currently, a "Read 100 Books, Write 1,000 Articles, Remember 10,000 Folk Songs" movement is sweeping across the region. Many people have begun to write folk songs, stories, quick-clapper rhymes, and ditties in the Zhuang language. In Luocheng County's Pinglu Agricultural Cooperative, commune members who have shaken off illiteracy are using the Zhuang language to write folk songs and big-character posters. One folk song reads: "To chop firewood on the mountain, you need a knife; to catch fish in the river, you need a net; if you want to build your hometown well, you must improve your cultural level."

    扫盲循环红旗大竞赛
    广西僮族自治区四十九个僮族聚居县，已展开了热火朝天的僮文扫盲循环红旗大竞赛。罗城县一马当先，实现了无文盲县。石龙、东兰等十个县紧跟着也基本完成了扫盲任务。一个多月来，扫盲入学人数由一百三十多万激增到二百四十多万，脱盲人数从三十多万上升到一百二十多万。
    在扫除文盲的地区，由于人民的文化水平提高了，直接促进了生产。都安瑶族自治县大兴区成为无盲区后，各个生产队都设了排工牌，用僮文写上每天的农活工种和任务要求，社员们看了就记在随身带的小黑板上；许多社员已经自己记工分。
    目前，各地正掀起一个“读百本书、写千篇文、记万首山歌”运动。许多人开始用僮文写山歌、故事、快板诗和顺口溜。罗城县平洛农业社已脱离文盲状态的社员们用僮文写山歌和大字报。有一首山歌写道：“上山砍柴要用刀，下河打鱼要用捞；想把家乡建设好，文化水平要提高”。（施峥尧）
