    We Don't Need This Kind of Advertising
    Ma Tieding
    The newspaper carried an advertisement for the film "The Case of Xu Qiuying." The advertisement emphasized in four-point bold type: "Xu Qiuying was murdered on Jiangxin Island. Who is the murderer?"
    If advertising is also a form of propaganda, then what does the above advertisement promote? It does not primarily expose the crimes of the bandits and special agents, nor does it arouse the audience's righteous indignation towards them, thereby raising revolutionary vigilance. Instead, it focuses on "who is it," using this to provoke the audience's curiosity and guide people towards an incorrect, mystified conception of the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.
    I believe this advertisement is a vulgar example of the old "advertising art." The advertisements in the newspapers of the working class are not purely for profit. They should not, and do not need to, use sensational language to attract customers or audiences. The newspaper is a textbook for life, and every word in the newspaper, including advertisements, must serve our socialist construction, and nothing else.

### 我们不需要这样的广告

    我们不需要这样的广告
    马铁丁
    报纸上登了影片“徐秋影案件”的广告，广告里用四号黑体字强调：“徐秋影在江心岛被人杀害了，凶手到底是谁呢？”
    如果说广告也是一种宣传，那么，上面这个广告宣传了什么呢？它主要的不是揭露匪特的罪恶，不是激发观众对匪特的义愤，从而提高革命警惕性，而是把重点放在“到底是谁”，以此挑逗观众的好奇心理，引导人们对肃反工作产生神秘化的不正确的观念。
    我认为这条广告是旧“广告术”的庸俗作风。工人阶级的报纸上的广告，不是单纯地为了求利，不应该、也不需要以耸人听闻之辞去招揽顾客、招揽观众。报纸是生活的教课书，报纸上的一字一句，连广告也包括在内，都必须为我们的社会主义建设事业服务，而不是其他。
