　　The Popular Action Front of Chile

　　The Popular Action Front of Chile is a unified political organization of progressive forces in Chile. It was formed by expanding the Popular Front organized by the Communist Party of Chile and the Socialist Party in February 1956. At that time, its members included the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Popular Socialist Party, the Labor Party, the Popular Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party. These parties together held eight seats in the Chilean Senate and thirty-six seats in the Chamber of Deputies. Later, the Popular Democratic Party merged into the Democratic Party in November 1956, and the Popular Socialist Party merged into the Socialist Party in July 1957. Therefore, the Popular Action Front is now a united front organization of four parties: the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Labor Party, and the Democratic Party.

　　In a joint statement issued at the time of the formation of the Popular Action Front, the six parties participating in the Popular Action Front pointed out that the purpose of establishing the Popular Action Front was to enable these parties to coordinate their actions in political, parliamentary, and trade union struggles, and in election campaigns. This front will unite all those who are willing to fight for the realization of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal program. Its goals are: to fight for the freedom of the people, to abolish persecutory laws, to fight for the rights of the working people, to oppose the imperialist policy of enslavement, and to strive for the restoration of broad trade relations with all countries. The various parties participating in the Popular Action Front retain the freedom and independence to express, propagate, and uphold their own ideological and political principles.

　　The Popular Action Front held its first congress in July 1956, passing a resolution on striving to unite the broad masses of working people. In December of the same year, it held its first National Congress, discussed and formulated the principles of a new policy to resolve the domestic economic crisis, and adopted a program for national liberation struggle. This program called on the Chilean people to unite and fight together with the Popular Action Front to strive for the establishment of a people's government, protect national wealth, implement economic policies that help improve the living standards of the working people, ensure national economic independence, implement land reform, and strive for peace and solidarity with the people of the colonies. The program also proposed that the Popular Action Front will continue to fight for the democratization of the political system, the abolition of repressive laws, the improvement of the cultural level of the masses, and the guarantee of complete freedom of trade union action.

　　The Popular Action Front's struggle program has won the support of the broad masses of the people. In April 1956, in the by-election of two members of the Chamber of Deputies, the Popular Action Front jointly campaigned with the Radical Party and won. In September 1957, the various member parties of the Popular Action Front, together with some Radicals, leaders of the United Workers' Union of Chile, and three thousand representatives from all walks of life, held a "People's Agreement Conference for the Presidential Election" to discuss the presidential election issue in September of this year, and publicly elected Allende as the presidential candidate, and adopted the election program.

　　智利人民行动阵线
    智利人民行动阵线是智利进步力量统一的政治组织，由智利共产党和社会党所组织的人民阵线于1956年2月扩大而组成的。当时的成员有共产党、社会党、人民社会党、劳工党、人民民主党和民主党。这些政党在智利参议院共拥有八个议席，在众议院共拥有三十六个议席。后来人民民主党在1956年11月并入民主党，人民社会党在1957年7月并入社会党，因此，现在人民行动阵线是共产党、社会党、劳工党和民主党四个政党的统一战线组织。
    参加人民行动阵线的六个政党在人民行动阵线成立时发表的联合声明指出，建立人民行动阵线的目的是使这些党派在政治、议会和工会斗争方面，在竞选运动方面能够互相配合行动。这一阵线将把一切愿意为实现反帝反封建纲领而奋斗的人团结起来。它的奋斗目标是：争取人民自由，取消迫害性的法律，争取劳动人民的权利，反对帝国主义的奴役政策，争取同各国恢复广泛的贸易关系。参加人民行动阵线的各个政党，保留在发表、宣传和维护自己的思想原则和政治原则方面的自由和独立性。
    人民行动阵线在1956年7月间举行第一次大会，通过关于争取团结广大劳动群众的决议。同年12月间举行第一次全国代表大会，讨论并制定了解决国内经济危机的新政策的原则，通过了民族解放斗争纲领。这个纲领号召智利人民群众团结起来同人民行动阵线一起进行斗争，争取建立人民政府，保护民族财富，执行有助于提高劳动人民生活水平的经济政策，保障国家的经济独立，实行土地改革，争取和平和同殖民地人民团结。纲领还提出，人民行动阵线将继续为政治制度民主化、废除镇压法律、提高群众的文化水平、保证工会行动的完全自由而斗争。
    人民行动阵线的斗争纲领获得了广大人民的拥护。1956年4月在补选二名众议员的选举中，人民行动阵线同激进党联合竞选，结果获胜。1957年9月，人民行动阵线各成员党派同某些激进党人、智利统一工人工会领袖和各界代表三千人举行“总统选举人民协议会”讨论今年9月的总统选举问题，公推阿伦德为总统候选人，并且通过了竞选纲领。　（叶）
