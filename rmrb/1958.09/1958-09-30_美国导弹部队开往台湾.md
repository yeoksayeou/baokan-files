Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: Seattle dispatch: While attempting to play international conspiracies regarding the Taiwan Strait tension, the U.S. Army authorities revealed on the 26th that a "Nike-Hercules" missile battalion that the United States decided to send to Taiwan has already departed from Seattle, Washington, for Taiwan.

It is revealed that this battalion is the Second Missile Battalion of the 71st Artillery Regiment, and it is the first time such a missile unit has come to the Far East.

At the same time, U.S. military figures continue to issue war threats against the Chinese people. Air Force Secretary Douglas even clamored when talking about the situation in the Taiwan Strait on the 27th that the Chinese people should "not be mistaken," and that U.S. fighter-bombers and light bombers could use so-called "high-explosive bombs and more powerful weapons" when "necessary."

Tactical Air Command Commander Weyland clamored on the same day that the U.S. Tactical Air Command has two "strike forces" deployed in "dangerous locations" at opposite ends of the world, one in the Middle East and one in the Far East.

    美国导弹部队开往台湾
    据新华社28日讯  西雅图消息：在台湾海峡紧张局势问题上企图玩弄国际阴谋的同时，据美国陆军当局26日透露，美国决定派往台湾的一个“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹营已经从华盛顿州的西雅图开往台湾。
    据透露，这个营是七十一炮兵团的第二导弹营，这样的导弹部队开来远东还是第一次。
    和这同时，美国军方人物继续对中国人民发出战争恫吓叫嚣。空军部长道格拉27日在谈到台湾海峡局势时竟然要中国人民“不要弄错”，美国的战斗轰炸机和轻轰炸机能在“必要时”使用所谓“高度爆炸性炸弹和威力更大的武器”。
    战术空军司令部司令威兰同一天叫嚷说，美国战术空军司令部已有两支“打击力量”部署在位于世界两极端的“危险地点”，即一支在中东，一支在远东。
