Xinhua News Agency, September 20th: Khrushchev wrote another letter to Eisenhower to warn him.
    U.S. Troops Not Withdrawing, Far East Will Have No Peace
    Atomic blackmail cannot scare the Soviet Union, nor can it scare China. If the United States were to launch an atomic attack on China, it would immediately suffer a deserved retaliatory strike with similar weapons.

Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, wrote to U.S. President Eisenhower again on the 19th regarding the situation in the Taiwan Straits. In his letter, he told Eisenhower: "I believe it is necessary to emphasize once again that an infringement upon the People's Republic of China is an infringement upon the Soviet Union."

Khrushchev said that the U.S. fleet must withdraw from the Taiwan Straits area, and U.S. soldiers must leave Taiwan and go home. Otherwise, there can be no lasting peace in the Far East.

Khrushchev emphasized that if the United States does not do this now, then the people of China will have no choice but to drive out the armed forces hostile to it from its own territory, from the territory where bases for attacking the People's Republic of China have been established.

Khrushchev said that without the support of the United States, neither the Chiang Kai-shek clique nor the so-called Taiwan issue would exist long ago; without American interference, the people of the entire region would already be living in peace and contentment. Everyone knows that the starting point for the illegal American occupation of these islands is to maintain the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan so that the United States can station its armed forces in the region and threaten the People's Republic of China with war.

Khrushchev said that it must also be pointed out that your letter opposes Taiwan and the coastal islands to all of China, which is an open attempt to create a "two Chinas" situation. This attempt to divide Chinese territory is resolutely opposed by the Chinese people and the Chinese government, and also by all who respect the sovereignty of all nations and the territorial integrity of all countries. There is only one government in China—the government of the People's Republic of China. To fail to see this means basing one's actions on illusions. Of course, illusions cannot serve as the basis for any country's foreign policy.

Khrushchev bluntly told Eisenhower that atomic blackmail against China could not scare the Soviet Union, nor could it scare China. He said that those who are plotting an atomic attack on China should not forget that it is not only the United States that possesses atomic and hydrogen weapons, as well as the corresponding means of delivering these weapons. If the United States were to launch such an attack on China, it would immediately suffer a deserved retaliatory strike with similar weapons.

Khrushchev said that launching a war against China will not bring the United States anything. Launching a war against the People's Republic of China means inevitably sending the sons of the American people to their deaths, and means igniting the flames of world war. This means that the ruling circles of the United States bear a grave responsibility to mankind and to history. This step by the U.S. government will be unanimously condemned by people all over the world, including the American people.

### 美军不撤离台湾远东就没有和平

    赫鲁晓夫再次写信警告艾森豪威尔
    美军不撤离台湾远东就没有和平
    原子讹诈吓不倒苏联，也吓不倒中国。如果美国竟然对中国发动原子进攻，那末，它就将立即遭到应有的、同类武器的反击。
    据新华社20日讯　苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫19日就台湾海峡地区局势问题再次写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔。他在信中对艾森豪威尔说：“我认为必须再一次强调指出，对中华人民共和国的侵犯就是对苏联的侵犯”。
    赫鲁晓夫说，美国舰队必须撤离台湾海峡地区，美国兵必须离开台湾回家去。否则，远东就不可能有持久和平。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，如果美国现在不这样做，那末人民中国别无办法，只有把敌视它的武装力量从它自己的领土上、从建立有进攻中华人民共和国的基地的领土上驱逐出去。
    赫鲁晓夫说，要是没有美国的支持，不论蒋介石集团，或者所谓台湾问题都早就不存在了；如果没有美国的干涉，整个这一地区的人民早已在过安居乐业的生活了。人人都清楚，美国非法侵占这些岛屿的出发点是要维持台湾蒋介石集团使美国可能把自己的武装力量驻扎在这一地区并用战争来威胁中华人民共和国。
    赫鲁晓夫说，还不能不指出，您的信中把台湾和沿海岛屿同全中国对立起来，这是公开企图制造“两个中国”的局势。这种分割中国领土的企图是中国人民和中国政府所坚决反对的，也是一切尊重各国人民主权和各国领土完整的人所坚决反对的。中国只有一个政府——中华人民共和国政府。不看到这一点就意味着把自己的行动建立在幻想上面。当然，幻想是不能作为任何国家外交政策的基础的。
    赫鲁晓夫直截了当地告诉艾森豪威尔，对中国的原子讹诈既吓不倒苏联，也吓不倒中国。他说，那些策划对中国进行原子进攻计划的人不应当忘记，并不只是美国，而且另一方也拥有原子武器和氢武器以及相应的发射这些武器的工具。如果美国竟然对中国发动这种进攻，那末，它就将立即遭到应有的、同类武器的反击。
    赫鲁晓夫说，对中国发动战争，不会使美国得到任何东西，对人民中国发动战争，就意味着让美国人民的子弟必然送死，意味着燃起世界大战的火焰。这就意味着美国统治集团对人类、对历史负有严重的责任。美国政府的这个步骤会受到包括美国人民在内的全世界人民的一致谴责。
