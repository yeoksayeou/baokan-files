Advocate for Appropriately Early Sweet Potato Harvesting
By a Commentator from this Newspaper

This year, China's sweet potatoes are planted widely and growing well, making an unprecedented bumper harvest a near certainty. According to preliminary statistics from the agricultural departments, the planting area this year has expanded by about 50% compared to last year, and the total output will increase threefold compared to last year, reaching 700 billion jin. This is another great victory in China's Great Leap Forward in agriculture.

How to arrange the sweet potato harvest is the first important issue in realizing a sweet potato bumper harvest.

When is the best time to harvest sweet potatoes? Is it better to do it earlier, or later? Considering all aspects, it is better to do it earlier. Specifically, in northern regions, it is best to change the old habit of digging after "Frost's Descent" and advance the sweet potato harvest to "Cold Dew"; in southern regions, it is best to change the old rule of digging after "Cold Dew" and advance the sweet potato harvest to around the "Autumn Equinox."

The first benefit of advocating for appropriately early harvesting of tuber crops is that it can adjust labor during the busy autumn harvest season. This year, China's tuber crop planting area is particularly large. The planting area of only six provinces, including Hebei and Henan, is equal to more than half of the total tuber planting area in the country. On the other hand, due to the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, the output of other autumn crops will also be very high. If we do not advocate for appropriately early harvesting of some tuber crops, all the autumn farm work will be squeezed together, and labor shortages will inevitably lead to neglect of one thing or another, affecting other agricultural activities. At the same time, all localities have decided to work hard again this winter and next spring to basically achieve water conservancy; to launch a large-scale deep plowing movement this autumn to improve the soil; and to launch a large-scale fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing movement to ensure that all crops next year have enough fertilizer. These measures, which are of great importance to agricultural production next year, require sufficient labor to be implemented. If we still follow the old habits of the past, we will either delay the sweet potato harvest or delay water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing, and deep plowing movements. Delaying the sweet potato harvest will bring huge losses to the people in the major sweet potato producing areas; delaying water conservancy and other basic agricultural construction will further affect next year's Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. These are all bad.

The second benefit of advocating for early harvesting of tuber crops is that it can adjust food consumption. This year's large increase in tuber crops has brought a new issue of how to arrange for their distribution. That is to say: what to do with more grain. All localities have made comprehensive utilization and storage plans, and these plans must be implemented with strong measures. However, the most important aspect of consuming tuber crops is still eating them. With a large tuber crop yield, which is also not easy to preserve, people should naturally eat more of them. The question is whether to concentrate all consumption in the autumn? Or to advance the harvest time appropriately and extend the consumption time as much as possible. Obviously, the latter method is welcomed by the masses.

There is also a third benefit, which is that appropriately early harvesting facilitates seed retention and processing utilization. According to research from agricultural departments and scientific research institutions, and according to the experience of farmers in various localities, sweet potatoes that are to be kept as seeds for the coming year need to be harvested earlier, and appropriately early harvesting can make the seed potatoes sprout vigorously. This year's sweet potato harvest is very large, and preliminary processing such as slicing and drying is the first step in ensuring comprehensive utilization of sweet potatoes. Slicing and drying also requires appropriately early harvesting. With early harvesting, there is less moisture, and the starch has not yet been converted to sugar, making it easier to dry or bake. Under current conditions, processing and drying should make more use of sunlight, and appropriately early harvesting can better utilize the still strong heat of the sun. Fresh sweet potatoes that are kept for consumption and feed should preserve as much nutrients as possible. Appropriately early harvesting allows fresh sweet potatoes to preserve their nutrients more completely. At present, the best way to preserve fresh sweet potatoes is through cellar storage. According to the experience of farmers in various localities, sweet potatoes harvested before the first frost can be stored for the longest time. From this, it can be seen that appropriately early harvesting is beneficial in all aspects.

Some people think that early harvesting will affect sweet potato yields. Yes, if harvested later, the sweet potatoes will grow a little bigger. But compared with the benefits mentioned above, in this year's situation, it is more beneficial to have a slightly smaller harvest that can take care of other aspects.

　　提倡适当早收红薯
　　本报评论员
    今年我国的红薯，种的多长得好，空前丰收是十拿九稳了。据农业部门初步统计，今年栽种面积比去年扩大50％左右，总产量将要比去年增长三倍，达到七千亿斤。这是我国农业大跃进中又一个伟大的胜利。
    如何安排红薯的收获工作，是实现红薯丰收的第一个重要的问题。
    在什么时候收获红薯最好呢？早一点好？还是晚一点好？从各方面考虑，还是早些好。具体地说，北方地区最好改变“霜降”开挖的老习惯，把红薯的收获期提前到“寒露”；南方地区最好改变“寒露”开挖的老规矩，把红薯的收获期提前到“秋分”前后。
    提倡薯类适当早收的第一个好处，是可以调剂秋收农忙时劳动力。今年我国薯类作物种植面积特别大，仅河北、河南等六个省，种植面积就等于全国薯类总栽种面积一半以上。另一方面，由于农业生产大跃进，其它秋季作物的产量也将很高。如果不提倡适时早收一部分薯类，秋收时各项农活挤在一起，劳动力不足，一定会顾此失彼，影响其他农事活动。同时，各地已经决定今年再大干一冬和明年一春，基本实现水利化；要在今年秋天大搞深翻地运动，改良土壤；还要大搞积肥造肥运动，以保证明年各种作物都有足够的肥料。这些对明年农业生产有极大关系的措施，都需要有充分的劳力才能实现。如果我们仍按照过去的老习惯办事，不是耽误了红薯的收获，就会耽误了水利建设、积肥造肥和深翻地运动。耽误了红薯的收获，会给广大薯产区人民带来巨大损失；耽误水利及其他农业基本建设，更会影响明年农业生产的大跃进。这都是不好的。
    提倡薯类早收的第二个好处，是可以调剂食用。今年薯类的大增产，带来了一个如何安排出路的新问题。这也就是说：粮食多了怎样办。各地已作了综合利用和储藏的计划，这些计划必须采取有力措施促其实现。但是，消耗薯类的最主要方面，还是食用。薯类产量多，又不易保存，自然应该多吃一些。问题是让它都集中到秋后去吃？还是尽可能把收获时间适当提早，食用时间拉长。显然的，后一种办法是受群众欢迎的。
    还有第三个好处，是适当早收后，便于留种和加工利用。据农业部门及科学研究机关的研究，据各地农民的经验，留作来年的种薯，需要早些收获，适当早收能使种薯发芽茁壮；今年薯类收获量很大，作为初步的加工如切片晒干等，是保证综合利用薯类的第一步工作。切片晒干也需要适当早收。早收水分少，淀粉还没有糖化，容易晒干或烘干。在目前条件下，加工晒干应该更多的利用阳光，适当早收就能更好地利用热力还较强的阳光。留作食用和饲料的鲜薯，应该保存尽可能多的养分。适当早收，鲜薯能更完全地保存它的养分。在目前，保存鲜薯的最好办法是窖藏。根据各地农民的经验，落霜以前收获的红薯，保存的时间最长。从这里就可以看出，适当早收无论对哪方面都有好处。
    有些人认为早收会影响红薯的产量。是的，收迟一些，红薯是会长大一点。但是如果同上面的好处相比，在今年的情况下，收获量少一点而能照顾其它方面的方便，好处是更多一些的。
