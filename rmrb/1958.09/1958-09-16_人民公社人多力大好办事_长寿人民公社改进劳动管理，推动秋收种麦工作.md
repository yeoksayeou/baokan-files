People's Communes Have Many People and Great Strength for Doing Things Well
Changshou People's Commune Improves Labor Management to Promote Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting

    Hebei Daily News: After the establishment of the Changshou People's Commune in Xinle County, based on the needs of current production, without disrupting the original production teams, the method of using the original production teams for the autumn harvest and organizing professional teams for wheat planting preparation was adopted. This resolved the contradiction between current production and wheat planting, and powerfully promoted production.

    The Changshou People's Commune in Xinle County was formed by merging sixty agricultural cooperatives, with 174,386 mu of land. Currently, it is necessary to strengthen field management of late autumn crops, harvest mature field crops in a timely manner, and accelerate the accumulation of fertilizer, transport of manure, and deep plowing of land to prepare for wheat planting. In order to complete various production tasks, the People's Commune Management Committee decided to temporarily merge the original 692 small production teams into 146 large teams, while disturbing the original production organization as little as possible. A portion of the labor force was drawn from each production team to form specialized assault teams for accumulating fertilizer, transporting manure, and deep plowing. The remaining labor force, under the leadership of the original production team leaders, was responsible for field management of late-season crops and autumn harvesting. This ensured that the wheat fields would be well planted without affecting the autumn harvest of the original small cooperatives. In Hejia Village, the original fifteen production teams were merged into four large teams after the establishment of the People's Commune. According to the technical expertise and physical strength of the members, stronger laborers were drawn to form assault teams for accumulating fertilizer, transporting fertilizer, and turning the soil, while the remaining laborers were responsible for autumn harvesting, late-season field management, and animal husbandry. The method of recording work points and distribution stipulates that all work related to deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer delivery, and other wheat planting preparations, as well as basic construction, should be calculated separately and transferred to the small teams to participate in this year's bonus distribution. Work related to autumn harvesting and late autumn crop management should still be calculated in the original small team and participate in this year's bonus distribution.

    Due to the timely improvement of labor management, it became easier to uniformly allocate labor and concentrate forces to tackle urgent production tasks. Because Changshou Town had a lot of land and a small labor force, the management of some crops was not good enough. On the second day after the establishment of the commune, more than 230 laborers were drawn from various teams to help with rush weeding, working hard for four days and nights, weeding 7,915 mu of land, pruning 2,870 mu of cotton, and pressing more than 450,000 jin of green manure.

    Due to the improved labor organization, labor potential was greatly developed, and labor efficiency was improved. Since Hejia Village improved its labor organization, the original labor attendance rate of the whole village accounted for 80% of the total labor force, which has now increased to 115% of the total labor force. The commune members said, "The People's Commune is really good, and there is no one who eats idle food." With the adjustment of the labor organization, a red flag competition was also launched between teams. Changshou, Hejia Village, Nanxieshen and other five villages put forward the slogan of "more fertilizer accumulation, faster delivery, deeper plowing, and no idlers in each team," and challenged Yuecun and Huapi villages. The members of Yuecun and Huapi also became energetic and filled eight large fertilizer pits in two days, pressing more than 15,000 carts of fertilizer. Lian Luojun, who was over sixty years old in Qingfeng Village, said: "Don't look at my age, I also want to compare with you young people." In two days and nights, the whole village weeded more than 3 million jin and pressed green manure. At present, this people's commune is concentrating its efforts on harvesting autumn crops, deep plowing the land, and preparing for wheat planting.

    人民公社人多力大好办事
    长寿人民公社改进劳动管理，推动秋收种麦工作
    河北日报讯　新乐县长寿人民公社建成以后，根据当前生产的需要，在不打乱原生产队的基础上，采用原生产队搞秋收，组织专业队搞种麦准备的办法，解决了当前生产与种麦的矛盾，有力地推动了生产。
    新乐县长寿人民公社是由六十个农业社合并建成的，有十七万四千三百八十六亩土地。当前既要加强晚秋作物的田间管理，适时收割成熟的大田作物；又要加紧积肥、送粪、深翻土地，为种麦作好准备。人民公社管理委员会为了完成各项生产任务，确定在暂时尽可能不打乱原来生产组织的条件下，把原来的六百九十二个小生产队，临时合并成一百四十六个大队，又由各生产队抽出一部分劳动力，分别组成积肥、送粪、深翻地等专业突击队，剩下的劳力仍在原生产队长的领导下，负责晚田作物的田间管理和秋收等工作。这样既能保证把麦田种好，又不影响原来各小社的秋收。何家庄村过去十五个生产队，建成人民公社后合并成四个大队，按社员的技术专长和体力强弱，把较壮的劳力抽出来组成积肥、送肥、翻地突击队，其余劳力负责秋收、晚田管理、畜牧饲养等工作。在记工分配办法上规定，参加深翻地、积肥、送肥等种麦准备以及基本建设的各项用工，都单独计工，转到各小队参加今年分红；对秋收和晚秋作物管理等用工，仍在原小队计工，并参加今年分红。
    由于及时改进了劳动管理，更便利了统一调配劳力，集中力量突击紧迫的生产任务。长寿镇因为地多、劳力少，有些作物管理的不够好，建成公社的第二天，就从各队抽出二百三十多名劳力帮助突击锄地除草，苦战四昼夜，锄地七千九百一十五亩，棉花整枝二千八百七十亩，除草压绿肥四十五万多斤。
    由于改进了劳动组织，还大大发挥了劳动潜力，提高了劳动效率。何家庄自从改进了劳动组织以后，全村原来劳动出勤率占劳力总数的80％，现在增加到占劳力总数的115％。社员们说：“人民公社真是好，连一个吃闲饭的都没有了。”随着劳动组织的调整，队与队之间还展开了夺红旗竞赛。长寿、何家庄、南协神等五个村提出了“积肥多、送的快、翻的深、队队无闲人”的口号，向岳村、化皮两个村挑了战。岳村、化皮的社员们也上了劲，两天时间就填满了八个大积肥坑，压肥一万五千多车。青风村六十多岁的连洛俊说：“别看我上了年纪，也要同你们年轻人比一比。”两昼夜全村除草三百多万斤压了绿肥。目前这个人民公社正在集中力量收秋，深翻土地，为种麦做好准备。
