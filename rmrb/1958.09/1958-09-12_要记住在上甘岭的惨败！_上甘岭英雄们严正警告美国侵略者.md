Remember the Disastrous Defeat at Triangle Hill!
    --Triangle Hill Heroes Sternly Warn American Aggressors
    Xinhua News Agency reporters Fang Di and Sun Yuchang

    The crimes of U.S. imperialism in carrying out military provocations and war threats against our country have aroused the immense anger of the Volunteer Army heroes who participated in the Triangle Hill battle. At rallies across the country, they unanimously warned the American aggressors: Remember the shameful defeat at Triangle Hill, don't seek your own death, and don't play with fire and get burned!

    People still clearly remember that five years ago, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army annihilated more than 25,000 invading U.S. troops and their puppet troops on two small hills at Triangle Hill. In that 43-day battle, the American General Van Fleet used two U.S. divisions, two ROK puppet divisions, seven U.S. artillery battalions, and five tank companies, totaling more than 50,000 troops, to launch a frenzied offensive against that narrow area. At that time, the enemy fired an average of more than 24,000 shells every day, and as many as 300,000 shells in one day and night; an average of 63 aircraft sorties were dispatched every day, and as many as 250 sorties on the most frequent day, dropping more than 500 heavy bombs and a large number of napalm bombs; 30 to 70 tanks were dispatched every day. Using so many troops to attack two small hills and using so much steel to bombard a three-square-kilometer position was extremely rare in the history of world warfare. But in this battle, the enemy suffered huge casualties and a large consumption of materials, and their paper tiger face was further exposed by the Chinese and Korean troops.

    The heroes of Triangle Hill reviewed the disastrous defeat of the American aggressors at Triangle Hill at various denunciation meetings. Zhang Xinyuan, a comrade-in-arms of the famous heroes Sun Zhanyuan and Huang Jiguang, said in a contemptuous tone: U.S. imperialism provokes everywhere and clamors for war everywhere, thinking that it still has a military advantage. In fact, from the Triangle Hill battle we personally experienced, it is nothing remarkable. We participated in the Triangle Hill battle from beginning to end. Although the enemy's forces were much larger than ours and their equipment far surpassed ours, one of our platoons could defeat the offensive of one of their companies or battalions, and even one or two soldiers could repel one of their squads or companies. Fu Zuoli and Kang Wencai, who had commanded a regiment and a battalion of troops in combat, said that in their units, soldiers Cui Hanbi and Chen Wuniu, among others, created a record of one person repelling the enemy's offensive of a company with unparalleled tenacity. Barber Shang Anqun killed or wounded more than 200 U.S. and ROK officers and soldiers in several battles. Niu Limin, who commanded the Triangle Hill anti-aircraft artillery unit, said: Aggressors always underestimate the power of the people. On the Korean battlefield, Van Fleet always liked to boast that they had "air superiority" for a period of time. However, at Triangle Hill, the U.S. Air Force was beaten into "birds startled by the mere twang of a bow" by our anti-aircraft artillery. Our soldiers said that the enemy's "air superiority" became "air fear of death."

    The common conclusion of these heroes who personally competed with U.S. imperialism is that the American aggressor is a complete paper tiger. At a protest rally, Zhao Lantian, who had commanded the Triangle Hill troops in combat, said: "We have already learned about the skills of U.S. imperialism on the Korean battlefield. War mongers should remember the shameful defeat in the Korean War, especially the Triangle Hill battle, and learn a lesson from it. The Chinese people have the power to defeat any aggressor, and we cannot tolerate the enemy's threats and provocations. Liberating Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan is the sacred task of the Chinese people. If the U.S. imperialists dare to interfere and obstruct, we will resolutely give them a devastating blow." At the same rally, Guo Chunfu, Zhang Zixiang, and Zhang Jinglu, who participated in the Triangle Hill battle, spoke successively, saying: "Have the war mongers forgotten the disastrous defeat at Triangle Hill? Do they want to taste the taste of Triangle Hill again?" "Five years ago, we had already defeated the invading army headed by U.S. imperialism on the Korean Peninsula together with the Korean People's Army. Are we still afraid of the American aggressors who have been unprecedentedly isolated today, when the East wind prevails over the West wind?"

    These heroes who have made military achievements for the Chinese and Korean people in the Triangle Hill battle have expressed that as long as the motherland gives an order, they will immediately take up their guns and move forward, so that the American aggressors will taste an even more disastrous defeat than they did at Triangle Hill.

    要记住在上甘岭的惨败！
    ——上甘岭英雄们严正警告美国侵略者
    新华社记者　方堤　孙玉昌
    美帝国主义对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁的罪行，激起了曾经参加过上甘岭战役的志愿军英雄们的无比愤怒，他们在全国各地的集会上，同声警告美国侵略者：要记住在上甘岭的可耻惨败，不要自寻死路，玩火自焚！
    人们还清楚地记得：五年前中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一起，在上甘岭两个小山头上，歼灭了侵朝美军及其仆从军二万五千多名。在那次为时四十三天的战役中，美国将军范佛里特使用了两个美军师、两个李伪军师、七个美军炮兵营和五个坦克连，共五万以上的兵力，向那狭小的地带进行了疯狂的进攻。那时敌人每天发射的炮弹平均二万四千多发，最多时一昼夜达三十万发；每天平均出动飞机六十三架次，最多的一天达二百五十多架次，投掷重磅炸弹五百多枚和大量的凝固汽油弹；坦克每天出动三十辆到七十辆。用这样多兵力进攻两个小山头，用这样多钢铁轰击三平方公里的阵地，在世界战争史上都是极其少见的。可是就在这一战役中，敌人遭受了巨大的伤亡和大量的物资消耗，他们的纸老虎的面目进一步被中、朝部队戳穿了。
    上甘岭的英雄们在各个声讨会上回顾了美国侵略者在上甘岭惨败的情形。著名的英雄孙占元和黄继光生前的战友张信元用轻蔑的口气说：美帝国主义到处挑衅，到处叫嚣战争，自以为军事上还拥有优势。其实，从我们亲身经历的上甘岭战役来看，它并没有什么了不起。我们是自始至终参加上甘岭战役的，尽管敌人的兵力比我们大得多，装备也远远超过我们，但是我们一个班就可以击溃它一个连或一个营的进攻，甚至一两个战士也击退它一个排或一个连。曾经指挥过一个团、一个营部队作战的傅作礼和亢文彩说，他所属的部队里，战士崔旱弼、陈五牛等，都以无比顽强的精神，创造过一个人击退敌人一个连进攻的战绩。理发员尚安群曾在几次战斗中先后打死打伤美李军官兵二百多人。指挥过上甘岭高射炮部队的牛利民说：侵略者总是容易对人民的力量估计不足的。在朝鲜战场上，有个时期范佛里特总喜欢吹他们拥有“空中优势”。可是，在上甘岭，美国空军却被我高射炮兵打得成了“惊弓之鸟”，我们的战士说，敌人的“空中优势”变成“空中忧死”了。
    这些亲自和美帝国主义较量过的英雄们，共同的结论是：美国侵略者是一个十足的纸老虎。在一次抗议集会上，曾指挥过上甘岭部队作战的赵蓝田说：“美帝国主义的本领，我们在朝鲜战场上已经领教过了。战争贩子们应该记住在朝鲜战争特别是上甘岭战役中的可耻惨败，从中吸取教训。我国人民是有力量打败任何侵略者的，我们不能容忍敌人的威胁和挑衅。解放金门、马祖和台湾，是我国人民的神圣任务，美帝国主义者胆敢干涉、阻挠，我们将坚决地给它以毁灭性的打击。”在同一集会上，参加过上甘岭战役的郭纯夫、张子祥、张景禄先后发言说：“难道战争贩子们已经把上甘岭的惨败全忘了吗？他们想再尝尝上甘岭的滋味吗？”“五年前，我们已经在朝鲜和朝鲜人民军一起，打败了以美帝国主义为首的侵朝军队，难道在东风压倒西风的今天，还怕那早已空前孤立了的美国侵略者吗？”
    这些在上甘岭战役中为中朝人民立下了战功的英雄们，纷纷表示：只要祖国一声令下，他们就要马上持枪向前，让美国侵略者再尝尝比他们在上甘岭更加惨败的滋味。
