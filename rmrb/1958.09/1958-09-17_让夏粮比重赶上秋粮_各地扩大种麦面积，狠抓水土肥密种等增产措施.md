Let Summer Grain Proportion Catch Up with Autumn Grain
Various Localities Expand Wheat Planting Area and Vigorously Grasp Measures to Increase Production Such as Water, Soil, Fertilizer, and Close Planting

(Our report) Winter wheat sowing has already begun in some areas, and most parts of the country are actively preparing for it.

Based on the experience of the 1958 wheat bumper harvest, this year's wheat planting requires universal deep plowing, heavy fertilization, close planting, and the use of improved varieties. Currently, various localities are vigorously preparing according to these requirements.

Provinces, cities, and autonomous regions deployed winter wheat sowing work very early. According to preliminary plans in various places, this year's winter wheat planting area will increase by tens of millions to hundreds of millions of mu compared with last year, and the yield per unit area will increase by one to several times on the basis of this year's bumper harvest. Each province plans to cultivate millions to tens of millions of mu of large-area high-yield fields, and to release high-yield "satellites" with yields of 10,000 to tens of thousands of jin per mu.

Major wheat-producing areas must expand wheat planting areas and require large-scale high yields. Henan requires wheat fields to be universally deep-plowed to one chi [approximately 1/3 meter], and high-yield areas to be deep-plowed to two chi. Hebei Province stipulates that wheat fields with a deep-plowing degree of less than one chi and five cun [approximately 1/2 meter] must be reworked. Shandong Province requires all wheat fields to be deeply plowed more than one chi and five cun, of which 30 million mu of large-area high-yield fields must be deeply plowed two to three chi; two million mu of high-yield "satellite" fields must be deeply plowed three to five chi.

In order to ensure that wheat fields achieve deep plowing and heavy application of base fertilizer, local leading organs mobilized farmers to improve deep plowing tools and vigorously accumulate fertilizer as early as July. According to statistics from Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces, more than 3.8 million sets of deep plowing plows have been promoted by the end of August. Jiangsu Province vigorously promoted rope-traction plows using various power sources. Various provinces have also achieved great results in accumulating fertilizer. In addition to vigorously developing indigenous fertilizer, farmers have accumulated generally more than 20,000 jin of soil fertilizer per mu of wheat field, and Shandong and Hebei provinces have reached 80,000 jin.

The work of plowing fallow land for wheat planting and implementing layered fertilization in combination with deep plowing in northern provinces began early. By the end of August, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan and other provinces had plowed more than 14 million mu. Since the end of August, the high tide of establishing people's communes and the mobilization of leading organs for autumn sowing have further promoted the movement to manufacture deep plowing tools, accelerate deep plowing, and layered fertilization. Many agricultural cooperatives in many areas put forward the slogan "Participate in the commune with deeply plowed land" and organized professional teams to carry out crash plowing. Recently, ten million people in Hebei Province participated in the crash movement to deeply plow land. Tianjin Prefecture, which has historically rarely plowed land due to its low-lying terrain, also experienced a revolution this year. Thousands of farmers worked day and night, and in a very short period of time, they rushed to deeply plow more than one million mu. The broad masses of farmers in Henan Province not only rushed to plow fallow land day and night, but also put forward the slogan "Plow as you harvest, plow every piece deeply," and plowed land planted with early autumn crops as soon as they were harvested. The deep plowing professional assault team in Fan County, Shandong Province, consisting of more than 50,000 farmers, set up a large camp in the fields and worked hard day and night. Their slogan is: "Work in the day, work at night, for wheat to produce 3,000 jin!" The more than 160,000 mu of land in Huo Fen County, Shanxi Province, which was deeply plowed by more than 1,200 professional teams, was all more than one chi and five cun deep, and more than 30,000 jin of base fertilizer was applied per mu. After inspection and acceptance, each piece of land has reached the standard of "topsoil remains on the surface, subsoil is mixed with fertilizer, each plow is tightly connected, and there is no missed plow."

Promoting close planting tools is one of the important preparations for autumn sowing. More than one million improved close planting drills have been promoted in Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi and other four provinces. The close planting drill created by Anguo County, Hebei Province, can sow more than 100 jin of wheat seeds per mu, and is currently being actively promoted in the province. With the full implementation of close planting, many areas feel that there is a shortage of seeds. In order to solve this problem, many provinces are actively selecting them from commodity grain; the leading organs of these provinces have instructed their subordinate areas not to rely on seed transfer, but must rely on their own efforts.

Deep plowing, heavy fertilization, and close planting have placed new demands on irrigation. These measures all require a large amount of irrigation water; at the same time, in order to ensure full and vigorous seedlings, wheat fields must also be irrigated before sowing. Therefore, the water demand for winter fields has greatly increased compared with previous years. According to this situation, many areas have made early arrangements for water conservancy construction and irrigation. Hebei, Shandong and other provinces have all calculated water accounts. According to calculations, the existing irrigation capacity in Shandong Province cannot meet the needs of wheat field irrigation before sowing. The provincial leaders have decided to mobilize farmers to take measures such as diverting water and digging temporary wells to strive for all wheat fields to be watered before sowing or water sowing.

Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, has 750,000 mu of low-lying land. At present, the first batch of low-lying land transformation projects has been successfully completed in Linhu Township. The construction area is more than 1,200 mu. These low-lying lands will be comprehensively utilized after digging rivers and building dikes to develop diversified operations: raising fish in rivers; planting basket willows, poplars, mulberries, tea trees, etc. on dikes and under ridges; large areas of land inside dikes can be planted with deep-water rice.

    让夏粮比重赶上秋粮
    各地扩大种麦面积，狠抓水土肥密种等增产措施
    本报讯　冬麦播种在部分地区已经开始，全国大部地区都在积极进行准备工作。
    根据1958年小麦丰产的经验，这次种麦要求普遍作到深耕、多肥、密植和采用良种。现在各地就在根据这个要求大力准备。
    各省、市和自治区很早就部署了冬麦播种工作。根据各地初步计划，今年冬小麦播种面积将比去年增加几千万亩到一亿亩左右，单位面积产量将在今年大丰收的基础上提高一倍到几倍。各省计划要培植几百万亩到几千万亩的大面积丰产田，并要放出亩产一万斤到几万斤的高产“卫星”。
    主要产麦区都要扩大种麦面积，都要求大面积丰产。河南要求麦地普遍深耕一尺，大面积高产地深耕二尺。河北省规定，麦田深耕程度不到一尺五寸的要返工。山东省要求所有麦田都深翻一尺五寸以上，其中三千万亩大面积丰产田要深翻二尺到三尺；二百万亩高产“卫星”田要深翻三尺到五尺。
    为了保证麦田达到深翻和多施基肥，早在7月间各地领导机关即发动农民改良深耕工具和大力积肥。据河南、山东、陕西、江西、湖北、安徽、江苏等省统计，到8月末已经推广深耕犁三百八十多万部。江苏省大力推广了利用各种动力牵引的绳索牵引犁。各省积肥也获得了很大成绩，除大搞土化肥外，农民积的土粪肥一般每亩麦田已有二万斤以上，山东、河北两省达到了八万斤。
    北方各省翻耕留待种麦的休闲地和结合深翻实行分层施肥的工作早就开始了，到8月下旬，陕西、山西、河北、河南等省已翻一千四百多万亩。从8月下旬以来，建立人民公社的高潮和领导机关对秋播的动员，进一步推动了制造深翻工具、加速深翻和分层施肥的运动。许多地区的农业社提出“带着深翻的土地参加公社”的口号，组织专业队突击翻地。河北省最近有一千万人参加了深翻地的突击运动。这个省由于地势低洼历来很少翻地的天津专区，今年也来了一次革命，成千上万的农民日夜鏖战，在很短的时间中即突击深翻一百多万亩。河南省的广大农民不仅日夜赶翻休闲地，还提出了“收一块翻一块，块块深翻”的口号，对种植早秋作物的土地做到了随收随耕。山东省范县由五万多农民组成的深翻专业突击队，在田间扎了大营，日夜苦干，他们的口号是：“白天干，黑夜干，为了小麦产三千！”山西省霍汾县经过一千二百多个专业队突击深翻的十六万多亩地，全部深达一尺五寸以上，每亩施了基肥三万多斤。经检查验收，每块地都达到了“表土留地面，底土掺了肥，犁犁紧相连，没有漏犁背”的标准。
    推广密植工具是秋播的重要准备之一。河南、山东、山西、陕西等四省已推广改良密植耧一百多万张。河北省安国县创造的密植耧每亩可播麦种一百斤以上，当前正在省内积极推广。全面实行密植，很多地区即感到种子不足。为了解决这个问题，不少省份正积极从商品粮中往外精选；这些省的领导机关已经指示所属各地不要依赖调种，必须自力更生。
    深耕、多肥、密植对灌溉提出了新的要求，这些措施都要求灌溉的水量要大；同时，为了保证苗全苗旺，麦田还要灌溉播前水。为此，冬田需水量比往年大大增加，根据这种情况，不少地区已对兴修水利和灌溉及早做了安排。河北、山东等省都算了水账。据计算，山东省现有的灌溉能力还不能满足麦田灌溉播前水的需要，省领导上已决定发动农民采取引水和打临时井等措施，力争全部麦田都浇上播前水或进行水种。
