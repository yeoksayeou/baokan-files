Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 10th – The People’s Liberation Army troops stationed in Qingdao, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, have mobilized and are ready to deal a fatal blow to the American warmongers at any time.

Since the American aggressors have intensified their military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area, the naval forces, under the slogan of "Transforming Anger into Strength," have intensified combat training, actively inspected and maintained various weapons, and guaranteed to their superiors: As soon as the order is given, they will immediately go to sea to carry out their missions. Air Force pilots, ground crews, and other staff are also intensifying their tactical and technical studies beside their fighter planes. They say: If the American aggressors dare to expand the war, all our planes will be put into battle within seconds of receiving the order to severely strike the enemy. The vast number of soldiers in the infantry units, in countless rallies, unanimously warned the American imperialists not to play with fire and burn themselves, to immediately stop military provocations, and to get out of Taiwan. They expressed their determination to defend the motherland's territory, territorial waters, and airspace with the most resolute actions, and to liberate Jinmen (Quemoy), Mazu (Matsu), and Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian, 10th – The PLA troops stationed in Lushun-Dalian warned: If the American imperialists dare to provoke a war in the Taiwan Strait, we will bury them and Chiang Kai-shek together in the sea.

Since the evening of the 6th, the troops stationed in Lushunkou have been holding rallies day and night to denounce the military provocations of American imperialism. The officers and soldiers solemnly declared to the motherland with enthusiasm and generosity: We are ready to obey the call of the motherland at any time and strike the aggressors. The soldiers said: If American imperialism dares to touch a single finger of the Chinese people, we will not only chop off its hands, but also cut off its head.

Fan Cai, a combat hero and battalion commander who participated in the liberation of Hainan Island, angrily stated at a rally: American imperialism cannot stop our just action to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan. We must liberate every inch of the motherland's territory just as we liberated Hainan Island.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 10th – The PLA border defense troops stationed on the Yunnan border warmly support Premier Zhou's statement and are determined to strengthen war preparations and be ready to meet the American aggressors at any time.

Border defense officers and soldiers in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture held solemn rallies to denounce the military provocations and war threats against our country by American imperialism. The officers and soldiers of the Fourth and Eighth Companies, who had fiercely annihilated the "elite" troops of Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism, in the Huaihai Campaign and were awarded the title of "Attacking like a Fierce Tiger, Defending like Mount Tai," expressed their determination to the Party branch after the meeting to defend the motherland and resist the American aggressors. The border defense troops stationed in the Ximeng Va Mountain area held a conference on the 7th, warning the American aggressors not to play with fire and burn themselves, and that the 600 million Chinese people who have stood up will not allow them to run rampant. The Simao garrison held a demonstration parade on the evening of the 7th, holding torches high to oppose American imperialist aggression. The nationally renowned "Steel Battalion" and the garrisons in Kaiyuan, Baoshan, and other places participated in the grand local parade, demanding that American imperialism immediately stop its aggression and get out of Taiwan.

Enraged by the provocative actions of American imperialism, all the officers and soldiers of the border defense troops are full of fighting spirit and high morale, and are determined to further strengthen combat readiness. Li Chengde, battalion commander of a certain national independence battalion, said: Our sons and daughters of all ethnic groups will definitely be able to quickly improve their skills in killing the enemy and, together with the brother troops from all over the country, participate in the struggle to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan.
