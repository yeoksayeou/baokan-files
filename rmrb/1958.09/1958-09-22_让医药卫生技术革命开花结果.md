The National Conference on the Exchange of Experiences in the Medical and Health Technology Revolution concluded in the capital on September 19. This conference was a review of the preliminary achievements made by medical and health personnel and the masses in just a few months, and also a promotional conference to further push the medical and health technology revolution to a new upsurge.

"Eliminating the Four Pests, Emphasizing Hygiene, and Eradicating Diseases" is the general program for medical and health work. In the past year, we have eliminated a large number of rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, and flies, and more than 800 basic "Four-Without" counties and cities have emerged. Emphasizing hygiene has become a habit of the broad masses of people in many places, and sanitary conditions have improved more than in the past. Many of the diseases that are most harmful to people's health have either been basically eliminated or controlled, or have been greatly reduced.

However, the achievements we have made in the medical and health technology revolution are far from meeting the needs of the country and the people. On the one hand, the development of the movement is not widespread or in-depth enough, and a large number of active forces among the broad masses have not yet been mobilized. On the other hand, a considerable number of personnel in the health work force still have serious bourgeois ideology and bourgeois individualism, which has caused certain obstacles to the medical and health technology revolution movement. In order to push the medical and health technology revolution to a new high, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party, fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, resolutely carry out the struggle between the two roads, smash the so-called "medical authority" of the bourgeoisie, establish the proletarian health aspirations, eliminate bourgeois ideology from all aspects and corners, tear off the masks of bourgeois experts, and defeat their various destructive activities.

Countless examples have proven that wherever the leadership of the Party is strengthened, and the instructions of the Party are followed, and the technical revolution is carried out wholeheartedly, significant achievements can be made in technological innovation or invention, in the improvement of organizational systems, medical ideology and style, or in the promotion of new prevention and treatment methods, no matter how many twists and turns and difficulties are encountered. All evil winds and noxious influences can be dispelled and defeated, making the movement full of vitality and developing vigorously forward. Conversely, it is either lifeless and stagnant, or the direction is unclear and the enthusiasm is insufficient. The result is not more, faster, better, and more economical, but less, slower, worse, and more expensive. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels must strengthen their leadership according to the progress of the medical technology revolution movement in various places and units, and promptly improve organizational work and communist ideological education work. With the deepening of the movement, new situations will inevitably raise new and higher demands in front of the Party, and many new contradictions and difficulties will inevitably arise. The Party organizations must promptly and earnestly study and solve all of these, so that the movement will always maintain a vigorous spirit and develop forward.

The experience of the technical revolution movement over the past few months has once again proved that only by following the mass line and liberating the mind can we smash the bourgeois expert line and eliminate the blind faith in bourgeois experts. On the one hand, bourgeois experts and intellectuals have tried their best to promote superstition of foreign countries, believing that China is inferior to others in everything, that we cannot study what foreign countries have not researched, and that we cannot do what foreign countries have not done. On the other hand, they try their best to flaunt themselves, creating the argument that science and technology are mysterious and unattainable to fool others, so that they believe that all technological innovations and inventions can only be made by their experts and celebrities, and no one else can do it. However, the new forces among the people, the advanced elements among the youth, are not bound by any superstition under the leadership of the Party. They dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act. These people, full of enthusiasm and energy, know that it is up to people to act. For the sake of the high-speed development of socialist production, for the health of 600 million people, and for the sake of patients, they must not be intimidated by them. These new therapies and technologies have finally been successfully researched by people who dare to fight against bourgeois ideology.

The experience of the past few months has once again told us that in order to carry out the technical revolution in a big way, we must resolutely implement the policy of "combining Chinese and Western medicine, combining indigenous and foreign methods," and give full play to the spirit of communist cooperation. Countless facts have proved that for many intractable diseases that are currently considered to have few methods and low efficacy in the world, such as hypertension, rheumatism, cirrhosis, chronic nephritis, diabetes, polio, optic nerve atrophy, etc., traditional Chinese medicine has higher efficacy. In particular, traditional Chinese medicine can use willow branches to set bones, enable some color-blind people to distinguish colors, treat acute appendicitis without surgery, and use acupuncture to enable deaf people to hear and mute people to speak. Snake medicine has a 100% cure rate for venomous snake bites, etc., which are rare or non-existent in the world. In terms of Western medicine, the amazing miracle achieved in rescuing Qiu Cai Kang's burns, the efficacy of diseases such as fulminant bacillary dysentery, the creation of new methods for the diagnosis and treatment of biliary ascariasis, the mortality rate of many major thoracic, abdominal, and craniocerebral surgeries is much lower than that of capitalist countries, and China's self-made artificial heart-lung machine has been successfully applied to clinical practice, as well as the achievements of countless other new therapies, new technologies, new drugs, and new equipment, have also caught up with or surpassed international standards. The treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine is extremely rich and colorful, and indigenous methods and indigenous experts also have extremely outstanding and valuable experiences and achievements in disease prevention and treatment. Many difficult and complex diseases that have not been solved by Western medicine and foreign prescriptions have long been conquered by traditional Chinese medicine and indigenous experts. Under the combination of Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine seriously, and the combination of Chinese and Western medicine, "Let tumors bow their heads, and hypertension give way," has achieved remarkable results in many places. The snake medicine invented by indigenous expert Ji Desheng, and the research on the activity patterns of wild rats by old lady Cao Yixiu, are all miracles that are not found in any books and unheard of by all foreign experts and foreign doctors. Of course, we must never be satisfied with this, and many major issues need to be further resolved. The highest peak of human medicine is waiting for us to climb. Therefore, we must continue to conscientiously implement the policy of "combining Chinese and Western medicine, combining indigenous and foreign methods," in particular, we must vigorously inherit and promote the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, collect and promote proven prescriptions and secret prescriptions, give play to the prevention and treatment power of indigenous experts and indigenous methods, actively carry out communist cooperation, and implement the experience of Shanghai Guangci Hospital in rescuing Qiu Cai Kang to all medical and health fronts, so that it will bloom more brightly and bear more fruitful results. So that China's new medicine will shine brightly in the world.

We believe that as long as we resolutely obey the leadership of the Party, resolutely implement the working methods and learning methods that combine leadership with the masses, combine theory with practice, and combine learning with creation, we will surely obtain incomparably great strength, overcome all difficulties, climb the highest peak of medical technology, completely seize the initiative of mankind in the struggle against nature, and greatly advance the victorious completion of the instructions given to us by Comrade Shaoqi in the report of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress: "Eliminate the 'Four Pests,' pay attention to hygiene, promote sports, eliminate major diseases, eliminate superstition, change customs, and invigorate the national spirit."

    让医药卫生技术革命开花结果
    全国医药卫生技术革命经验交流会议于9月19日在首都闭幕了。这次会议是医药卫生人员和人民群众在短短几个月中取得初步成就的检阅大会，也是进一步把医药卫生技术革命运动推向新高潮的促进大会。
    “除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病”是医药卫生工作的总纲。将近一年来，我们已经消灭了大量的鼠雀蚊蝇，出现了八百余个基本的四无县市，讲卫生在许多地方已经成为广大人民的习惯，卫生状况比过去更为改善，许多危害人民健康最大的疾病有的已被基本消灭或控制，有的已大大减少了。
    但是，我们医药卫生技术革命已取得的成就，比起国家和人民的需要来说，还是远远不够的。一方面是运动的发展不够普遍深入，广大群众中还有大量的积极力量尚未调动起来。另一方面，在卫生工作队伍中，还有相当一部分人员存在着严重的资产阶级思想和资产阶级个人主义，使医药卫生的技术革命运动受到一定的障碍。为了把医药卫生技术革命推向新的高潮，必须加强党的领导，充分发动群众，依靠群众，坚决开展两条道路的斗争，大破资产阶级的所谓“医药权威”，大立无产阶级卫生志气，从各方面、各个角落，清除资产阶级思想，揭掉资产阶级专家的盖子，打垮他们各式各样的破坏活动。
    无数事例证明，凡是加强了党的领导，遵照党的指示，忠心耿耿大闹技术革命的地方，不论技术革新或发明创造，不论组织制度、医疗思想作风的改进，或新的防治方法的推行，尽管经过多少曲折困难，都能获得显著成就；一切歪风邪气，都能被驱散打退，使运动充满生气，蓬蓬勃勃顺利向前发展。反之，不是死气沉沉、裹足不前，就是方向不明，干劲不足。其结果不是多快好省，而是少慢差费。因此，各级党组织必须根据各地各单位医药技术革命运动进展的情况加强领导，及时改进组织工作与共产主义的思想教育工作。随着运动的深入，在党的面前，新的情况必然会提出新的更高的要求，必然会产生许多新的矛盾和困难，所有这些，党组织都必须及时认真加以研究解决，使运动始终保持旺盛的精神向前发展。
    几个月来技术革命运动的经验再次证明，走群众路线，解放思想，才能粉碎资产阶级的专家路线，破除对资产阶级专家的迷信思想。资产阶级的专家和知识分子，一方面竭力宣扬迷信外国，认为中国样样不如人，外国没有研究的，我们不能研究，外国没有作过的，我们不可能作；另一方面，则竭力炫耀他们自己，制造科学技术神秘莫测、高不可攀的论调来愚弄别人，使之认为一切技术革新和发明创造只能是他们专家、名流们才作得到，别的什么人都不行。但是，人民群众中的新生力量，青年中的先进分子，在党的领导下是任何迷信都束缚不住的。他们敢想敢说，也敢作敢为。这些充满热情和干劲的人们知道事在人为，为了高速度发展社会主义生产，为了六亿人民的健康，为了病人，决不能为他们所吓倒。这些新疗法、新技术终于被敢于向资产阶级思想进行斗争的人们研究成功了。
    几个月的经验再次告诉我们，大闹技术革命，必须坚决贯彻执行“中西结合，土洋并举”的方针，充分发挥共产主义大协作的精神。无数事实证明，目前世界上认为办法不多、疗效不高的许多疑难疾病，如：高血压病、风湿病、肝硬变、慢性肾炎、糖尿病、小儿麻痹、视神经萎缩等，中医都有较高的疗效。特别是中医能用柳枝接骨，使某些色盲会辨别颜色，治急性阑尾炎不开刀，用针刺能使聋子会听、哑巴会说话，蛇药治疗毒蛇咬伤疗效达100％等，都是世界上没有或少有的。在西医方面，抢救丘财康烧伤所取得的惊人奇迹，暴发性菌痢等病的疗效，胆道蛔虫诊断和治疗新方法的创造，许多胸腔、腹腔、颅脑大手术的死亡率大大低于资本主义各国，我国自制的人工心肺已成功地应用于临床，以及其他无数新疗法、新技术、新药品、新器械的成就，也都赶上或超过了国际水平。祖国医学宝库是极为丰富多彩的，土法、土专家在防治疾病中也都有极其出色的宝贵的经验和成就。许多奇难大症，在西医洋方尚未解决的，却早被中医、土专家攻克了。在西医认真学习中医，中西医结合之下，“让肿瘤低头，高血压让路”，已经在许多地方，取得显著成绩了。土专家季德胜发明的蛇药，曹依秀老太太对于野鼠活动规律的研究等等，都是任何书本所没有，一切洋专家、洋博士闻所未闻的奇迹。当然，我们绝不能以此为满足，许多重大问题有待于进一步地解决，人类医学的最高峰，正在等待我们来攀登。因此，我们必须继续认真贯彻“中西结合、土洋并举”的方针，特别是必须大力继承和发扬祖国医学遗产，收集和推广验方和秘方，发挥土专家、土办法的防治力量，积极开展共产主义大协作，把上海广慈医院抢救丘财康的经验，贯彻到各个医务战线上，使开更加鲜艳之花，结更加丰硕之果。使中国新医学在世界上大放异彩。
    我们相信，只要坚决服从党的领导，坚决贯彻领导与群众相结合、理论与实际相结合、学习与创造相结合的工作方法和学习方法，我们就一定能获得无比巨大的力量，战胜一切困难，攀登医药技术的最高峰，完全夺得人类对自然斗争的主动权，大大提前胜利完成少奇同志在“八大”二次会议报告中给予我们的指示：“消灭‘四害’，讲究卫生，提倡体育，消灭主要疾病，破除迷信，移风易俗，振奋民族精神”。
