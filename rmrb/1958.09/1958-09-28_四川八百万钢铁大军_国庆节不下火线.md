Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 27th – The eight million steel warriors battling in the mountains and valleys of Sichuan, as well as the workers in the coal mines, railways, and shipping departments, have all proposed not to take holidays or be absent from work during National Day, determined to create new achievements as a gift for National Day.

The recent series of military provocations by the American aggressor group has aroused great indignation among the vast numbers of farmers and workers fighting for steel. The more than eight million strong army fighting day and night on the steel front has proposed: We will not leave the front lines during National Day, we will produce more steel and iron, and crush the American imperialist aggressors to death. They guarantee to push the daily output of pig iron past the 20,000-ton mark on the eve of National Day. The 310,000-strong steel army in Kai County has issued a challenge to all steel warriors in the province, guaranteeing that everyone will work and everyone will be at the furnace during National Day, ensuring that the county's four thousand indigenous blast furnaces will produce over a thousand tons of pig iron daily. Tan Jun and more than 30 other workers in the open-hearth furnace workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have proposed that in addition to not taking holidays during National Day, they have also decided to give up National Day shifts, concentrating their efforts on production. Workers in the company's small rolling mill and refractory materials workshop have also posted big-character posters, guaranteeing full attendance and safe production during National Day.

In order to strive to increase the production of coal and coke to meet the urgent needs of Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant and the tens of thousands of small blast furnaces in the province, the 100,000 coal miners in Sichuan have decided to continue production as usual during National Day, guaranteeing to create two high-yield days before National Day. The original plan for Zhongliangshan Coal Mine was to produce 100,000 tons of coal this year, but now it has been decided to increase it to 200,000 tons. The daily output of Donglin Coal Mine is usually around 2,000 tons, but on the 25th it has already leaped to more than 3,500 tons.

The guarantee proposed by the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway workers is: work as usual during National Day, make one train do the work of two, treat the night as day, and race against time. To this end, from loading and unloading personnel to medical personnel and office cadres, all have been mobilized to participate in loading and unloading to ensure the timely transportation of materials needed by various steel plants and indigenous blast furnaces.

    四川八百万钢铁大军
    国庆节不下火线
    新华社重庆27日电  战斗在四川丛山峻岭中的八百万钢铁战士，以及煤矿、铁路、航运部门的职工，纷纷提出国庆节不休假、不缺勤，决心创造新的成绩向国庆节献礼。
    美国侵略集团最近一系列的军事挑衅激起了为钢铁而战的广大农民、职工极大的愤慨。日夜奋战在钢铁战线上的八百多万大军提出：国庆节不下火线，要多产钢和铁，压死美帝国侵略者。他们保证在国庆节前夕使生铁日产量冲破两万吨大关。开县三十一万钢铁大军向全省钢铁战士提出挑战，保证在国庆节做到人人出工、个个上炉，要使全县四千座土高炉日产生铁突破千吨。重庆钢铁公司大平炉车间炼钢工人谭均等三十多个职工提出除国庆节不休假以外，还决定放弃国庆节轮休，集中精力搞好生产。这个公司小型轧钢车间、耐火材料车间的职工，也纷纷贴出大字报，保证国庆节做到全部出勤和安全生产。
    为了努力增产煤和焦炭，满足重庆钢铁厂和全省几万座小高炉的紧急需要，四川十万煤矿工人决定国庆节照常生产，保证在国庆节前创造两个高产日。中梁山煤矿原计划今年生产十万吨煤，现在决定增加到二十万吨。东林煤矿平时日产量在二千吨左右，25日已经跃进到三千五百多吨。
    成渝铁路职工提出的保证是：国庆节照常工作，做到一车当两车、黑夜当白天、分秒必争。为此，从装卸运转人员到医务等人员、机关干部，都已动员起来参加装卸，以保证及时运输各钢铁厂和土高炉所需要的物资。
