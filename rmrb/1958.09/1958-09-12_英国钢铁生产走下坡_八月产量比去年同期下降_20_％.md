Xinhua News Agency, London, September 11th: According to figures released today by the British Iron and Steel Board, British steel production in August fell by about 20% compared with the same period last year, dropping to an annual rate of 15.6 million tons. The current operating rate of the British steel industry is only about 70% of its production capacity. Pig iron production has also decreased, with the average weekly output falling from 272,500 tons in August last year to 221,000 tons.

Steel consumption has also fallen by about 5% compared to last year's level. Demand has decreased for most types of steel products, mainly in the industrial sectors producing capital goods.

The "Financial Times" pointed out today that since the middle of this year, the decline in steel production and consumption "has spread and deepened." According to the newspaper, Britain has had to re-examine its original "development plan" to invest 600 million pounds in the steel industry by 1962, because this plan was based on the assumption that industrial output would increase by 3.75% annually, and steel consumption would increase by 4.25% annually.

    英国钢铁生产走下坡
    八月产量比去年同期下降20％
    新华社伦敦11日电　根据英国钢铁局今天发表的数字，8月份英国钢产量比去年同期下降了20％左右，降到年率产量一千五百六十万吨。英国炼钢工业目前的开工率只达到它生产能力的70％左右。生铁产量也下降了，每周平均产量从去年8月份的二十七万二千五百吨减少到二十二万一千吨。
    钢的消费量也比去年的水平下降了约5％。对大多数类型的钢产品的需求都减少了，这主要表现在生产资本货物的工业部门上。
    “金融时报”今天指出，自从今年年中以来，钢的产量和消费量下降的情况“已经扩展开来，而且已经更加深入”。据这家报纸说，英国不得不重新审查它原定到1962年投资六亿英镑的钢铁工业“发展计划”，因为这个计划是建立在下面这种假定的基础之上的：工业产量每年增加3％又四分之三，钢的消费量每年增加4％又四分之一。
