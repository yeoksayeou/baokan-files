　　Bumper Harvest of Big Peaches
　　Some Weigh Half a Jin, Others Over a Jin
　　The juicy and sweet big peaches, one of Shandong's famous specialties, are ripe. In Feicheng County, the 45,000 big peach trees are reporting a widespread bumper harvest, with an estimated yield of three million jin of big peaches.

　　In the agricultural production cooperatives of Huangzhuang, Shangli, Dongli, Yangzhuang, and other places in Taoyuan Township, which is rich in big peaches, each fruit tree bears 300 to 400 peaches, with the heavy ones weighing over a jin each and the light ones weighing over half a jin.

　　This year's extraordinary bumper harvest of big peaches was achieved in the new situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, through the great efforts of agricultural cooperatives in strengthening technical management and fighting against natural disasters. Last winter, in order to prevent peach trees from being damaged by frost and pests, the agricultural cooperatives carried out work such as soil cultivation, applying lime-based pesticides to the tree trunks, and pruning after moving ice and accumulating snow; during the peak flowering period in spring, they also carried out topdressing and measures to prevent spring frost, and when there was a drought in June, they mobilized cooperative members to carry water to irrigate the peach trees.

　　Shangli, Huangzhuang, Yangzhuang, and other cooperatives in Taoyuan Township also cultivated more than 200 "satellite big peaches" on the best land for growing big peaches, and assigned peach farmers with special-grade skills to strengthen later-stage management with the greatest effort, striving to grow each big peach to more than three jin. Now, the satellite big peaches have grown to about two jin. The cooperative members say that after waiting another half month, they will present the satellite peaches flying into the sky to Chairman Mao as a gift.　Wang Chengyu

　　肥桃大丰收
　　轻的有半斤、重的一斤多
    山东著名特产之一——多汁而香甜的肥桃已经成熟了。肥城县四万五千棵大桃普告丰收，预计可产大桃三百万斤。
    盛产肥桃的桃园乡黄庄、尚里、东里、杨庄等地农业生产合作社的果树，每棵结桃三百个到四百个，重的每个一斤以上，轻的也在半斤以上。
    今年肥桃的特大丰收是在农业生产大跃进的新形势下，农业社以极大的努力加强了技术管理和与自然灾害斗争取得的。去年冬季为了防止桃树受冻和虫害，各农业社就进行了培土、用石灰药剂糊树身和进行了搬冰积雪整枝等工作；春季盛花期又进行了追肥和防止春冻等措施，在6月天旱时发动社员担水灌浇了桃树。
    桃园乡尚里、黄庄、杨庄等社还在生长肥桃最好的土地里培植了二百多棵卫星大桃，固定有特等技术的桃农用最大努力加强后期管理，争取每个大桃长到三斤以上，现在卫星大桃已长到二斤左右，社员们说再待半月后带着飞上天空的卫星肥桃向毛主席献礼。　王承玉
