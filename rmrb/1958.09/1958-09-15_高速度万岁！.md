Long Live High Speed!

“The East Wind sends out signals of victory,
We race towards spring.
Holding high the vow to ‘catch up with Britain in fifteen years,’
The East Wind sends us soaring into the clouds.
Wind and electricity can't keep up with us,
Time can never see the heels of our feet.
The Party’s encouragement fills us with strength,
Old-brand empires gasp and groan like old oxen.”

This is a poem written by a worker. This poem, which seems full of romantic color, is an apt and realistic portrayal of our country's current socialist construction. When we step through the magnificent archway of the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition, we will immediately feel excited and proud that our motherland is like a vigorous steed, galloping forward at an unprecedented high speed.

Here, tens of thousands of dazzling exhibits flash with a brilliant number: 19.2% - this is the average annual growth rate of China's industry during the First Five-Year Plan. This number tells people that the speed of the New China's industrial leap forward is unprecedented in the history of old China's industry, and it is also unprecedented in any capitalist country. The distance we have traveled in just five short years far exceeds the hundred years of old China; in the industrial development history of capitalist countries like the United States and Britain, it took more than ten or even twenty years to complete these journeys.

In these short five years, our steel production has exceeded more than twice the total of the old China's fifty-eight years since the opening of the Hanyang Iron Works in 1890. In 1957, steel production reached 5.35 million tons, an increase of 33 times compared to 1949; our investment in capital construction, over the past five years, amounts to 570 million taels of gold; newly added fixed assets in industry have exceeded the hundred years of old China since the establishment of modern industry in the 1860s. …

When people read these radiant figures and see the red arrows on the charts that seem to have grown wings, who can restrain their inner excitement? But, looking again at the even higher red arrows of this year - the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan - the lightning-fast speed of industrial development is truly "a sky beyond the sky." The rapid pace of progress during the First Five-Year Plan, which was already outstanding, is somewhat out of reach compared to the pace of this year's Great Leap Forward.

In the first eight months of this year, China's total industrial output value increased by 47% compared to the same period last year. What is particularly exciting is that the pace of the past eight months has been getting faster month by month. If the total national industrial output value in the same month of 1957 is taken as 100, then the figures for January to August this year are: 114, 118, 129, 142, 146, 155, 174, 201. It is indeed rising step by step, soaring straight up. People see at the exhibition that those beautiful, latest, heavy, and highly precise products are mostly the offspring of this year's Great Leap Forward.

In the vast rural areas, border regions, grasslands, and deep mountains and valleys of our country, the red flags of socialist industry have been planted in just a few months this year.

The high speed of industrial development in our country once again eloquently proves the truth that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. From 1953 to 1957, while China's industry was flying forward at a rate of 19.2% per year, the United States' industry grew at 2.8% per year and Britain's at 3.9%. This means that in these five years, for every 192 steps that the vigorous Chinese people took forward, the United States could only take 28 steps forward, and Britain could take 39 steps forward. Sometimes they were advancing and retreating, and sometimes they were standing still. This year, in the days when hundreds of millions of people in our country are striding forward and advancing with high spirits, the Western world is even more a desolate scene of autumn wind and withered yellow leaves. In the first half of the year, the United States' industry decreased by 10.8% compared to the first half of 1957, and Britain decreased by 2%; their main products such as steel, pig iron, and raw coal have all shrunk and declined compared to last year.

Seeing the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people, some newspapers in capitalist countries said in a panic that "the red industrial dragon is galloping forward, soaring into the clouds," and some exclaimed that the "economic Olympic Games have begun." So, what is the record on this Olympic "track"? According to data from relevant departments, during the First Five-Year Plan, China's steel production has already run from the thirteenth place to the ninth place, surpassing five capitalist countries: two were surpassed in 1953, one in 1954, and two more in 1956. And this year, we will definitely surpass two more capitalist countries. In addition, China's pig iron production also surpassed three capitalist countries during the First Five-Year Plan; power generation surpassed eight capitalist countries; cement surpassed three capitalist countries. …

And what is particularly proud is what is happening this year. The exhibition shows that it is estimated that this year China's steel production will jump from 5.35 million tons last year to 10.7 million tons; power generation will jump from 19.3 billion kilowatt-hours to 27.5 billion kilowatt-hours; coal will jump from 130 million tons to 210 million tons.... And what was the situation of the old British Empire in those years equivalent to our current year? It took thirty-one years for its steel to grow from 5.11 million tons to 10.02 million tons; it took seventy-five years for its coal to grow from more than 120 million tons to 200 million tons; its electricity development was considered fast, but it also took four years to grow from 18.8 billion kilowatt-hours to 27.7 billion kilowatt-hours. The facts are so clearly displayed: we have done in one year what it took Britain four years, thirty-one years, or even seventy-five years to do.

The countless indisputable facts at the exhibition answer people's question: Why can China's industry, especially in this year's Great Leap Forward, advance so rapidly at such a miraculous speed? To borrow an idiom: Many hands make light work. Today, running industry has become a national movement in our country.

Let's take a look at how the steel marshal rose to power. There is a map of the distribution of the national iron and steel industry at the exhibition, which is really exciting to see. From 1950 to 1957, in the eight years, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry newly built and expanded more than 100 iron and steel enterprises, and now they are scattered all over the country, with flowers blooming all over the garden. This year alone, the number of iron and steel enterprises to be newly built and continued to be built across the country will reach 215. Among them are large ones, medium and small ones; there are red flowers and green leaves. And the hundreds of thousands of indigenous blast furnaces that have been decided to be built in various places this year have not yet been included. By the end of August, more than 240,000 of these indigenous blast furnaces had been built.

Just two months ago, Henan Province had not smelted a ton of steel. But now, more than 30,000 indigenous blast furnaces and small blast furnaces combining indigenous and foreign methods, and 1,100 small converters and indigenous converters have been built throughout the province. Molten iron and molten steel have been flowing in the Henan Plain, not only smelting ordinary steel, but also smelting high-grade steel. The province has organized nearly one million people to invest in steel production. People at the exhibition told me that the people of Dengfeng County at the foot of Mount Song, originally had no iron at all. They deeply felt the pain of "having no iron in hand and accomplishing nothing." This spring, they launched an industrial construction movement throughout the county. From the county party secretary to the elderly women in their seventies, hundreds and thousands of people went to the mountains to explore and mine, and learn to smelt iron. In less than two months, more than 200 indigenous blast furnaces were built throughout the county. In Mayu Township, everyone was anxious because the construction of blast furnaces lacked pig hair to make filtering material. Qu Songsheng, the director of the township women's federation and a member of the Communist Youth League, learned about this and resolutely cut off her long braids and donated them to the indigenous blast furnaces as filtering material. This incident moved the men and women, old and young in Mayu Township. Then, more than 1,800 women cut off their braids and donated them to the indigenous blast furnaces....

People like Qu Songsheng, with a sincere heart for socialist industrialization and a passionate longing for the bright future of socialist industrialization, are countless in our country. What difficulties can they not overcome on the road to progress?

The coal pavilion displays another example of a national undertaking in industry: Liling County in Hunan Province, which is rich in porcelain, has established more than 100 coal mines in 48 townships in just a few months this year, and can produce more than 500 tons of coal every day. In this way, not only do all the porcelain kilns and every household of farmers in the county have coal to burn, but they can also support the newly emerging industrial city of Zhuzhou nearby. Of course, Liling County is just one example. Due to the national undertaking in coal mining, the production capacity of newly built coal mines across the country this year will exceed the output of all newly built coal mines in the First Five-Year Plan.

Like Henan Province, Dengfeng County, and Liling County, more than 20 provinces, municipalities directly under the central government, and autonomous regions, and more than 2,000 counties and autonomous counties across the country, are all working hard today, striving to fly forward on the road to industrialization.

Anyone can clearly see from the exhibition that the Party's general line for socialist construction, the policy of the whole Party running industry and the whole people running industry, the simultaneous emphasis on industry and agriculture, the simultaneous emphasis on central industry and local industry, and the simultaneous emphasis on large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises, have today been grasped by hundreds of millions of people, and have generated tremendous material forces - the process of national industrialization has been accelerated.

With infinite excitement, we walked out of the magnificent building of the exhibition hall, and everyone felt that they had returned with a full load. The early autumn sunshine in Beijing seemed particularly bright, shining on the eighty-meter-high gilded iron tower, emitting a sparkling golden light. Looking up at the laurel leaves symbolizing honor on the top of the columnar hall of the exhibition hall, we respectfully admired the thousands of heroes who have made contributions in accelerating the process of industrial construction.

At this time, I remembered an article in the "Free Romania Daily" recently entitled "One Day Equals Twenty Years." The author enthusiastically hailed the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in our country and said: "When historians describe the face of our era many years later, they will definitely choose the most proud thing from such proud facts: the speed of economic development in socialist countries." "People who have been plundered and oppressed for centuries are completing in a few years what they have not completed in the past decades and centuries."

We cheer: Our motherland has stepped into the great era of "one day equals twenty years" as predicted by Marx ninety-five years ago. We cheer: Long live the speed of socialist construction in our great motherland!

### 高速度万岁！

专栏：

    高速度万岁！
    “东风发出胜利的讯号
    我们向着春天奔跑
    高举‘十五年赶上英国’的誓词
    东风送我们直上云霄
    风和电追不上我们
    时间永远看不见我们的脚跟
    党的鼓舞使我们浑身是劲
    老牌帝国像一条老牛在喘息呻吟”
    这是一个工人写的诗。这首看来富有浪漫色彩的诗，却是我国当前社会主义建设恰切的现实主义的写照。当我们跨进全国工业交通展览会雄伟的拱门，就会立刻兴奋而且自豪地感到，我们的祖国正像一匹矫健的骏马，以史无前例的高速度，一日千里地向前飞驰。
    在这里，数万件琳琅满目的展品，闪烁着一个光辉灿烂的数字：19.2％——这是第一个五年计划建设期间，我国工业每年平均增长的速度。这个数字告诉人们，新中国工业大踏步前进的速度，是旧中国工业史上从来没有过的，也是任何资本主义国家从来没有过的。我们在短短五年走完的路程，远远超过了旧中国的一百年；在美、英资本主义国家工业发展史上，走完这些路程用了十几年甚至二十几年。
    在这短短的五年，我们的钢产量超过了旧中国从1890年开办汉冶萍公司以来五十八年的总和的一倍多，1957年钢产量达到五百三十五万吨，比1949年增加了三十三倍；我们用于基本建设的投资，五年来折合五万万七千万两黄金；工业方面新增加的固定资产，超过了旧中国从十九世纪六十年代开始建立现代工业以来的一百年。……
    人们读到这些光彩焕发的数字，看到图表上那些像长了翅膀似的红箭头，谁还能抑制住内心的激动？但是，再看看今年——第二个五年计划头一年那些飞得更高的红箭头，那风驰电掣般的工业发展速度，真是“天外有天”了。第一个五年计划期内那些本来是十分出色的快速前进的步伐，和今年大跃进的步伐比起来，却有些望尘莫及了。
    在今年头八个月，我国工业总产值比去年同期激增了47％。特别令人兴奋的是，八个月来的步伐是，一个月比一个月更快。假如全国工业总产值以1957年的同月为100，那么今年1月到8月是：114，118，129，142，146，155，174，201。正是步步高升，扶摇直上。人们在展览会上看到，那些美不胜收的、最新的、重型的、高度精密的产品，绝大多数是今年大跃进中的产儿。
    在我国广大的农村、边疆、草原和深山密谷中，在今年短短的几个月里，都已经插上了社会主义工业的红旗。
    我国工业发展的高速度，再一次雄辩地证明了东风压倒西风的真理。就是在1953年到1957年，我国工业每年以19.2％的速度向前飞奔的同时，美国工业每年增长2.8％，英国3.9％。这就是说，这五年当中，矫健的中国人民每向前迈进一百九十二步，美国只能向前走二十八步，英国走三十九步，他们有时是进进退退，有时在原地踏步。今年，在我国亿万人民昂首阔步、高歌猛进的日子里，西方世界更是一片秋风萧索、黄叶雕零的凄惨景象。上半年，美国工业比1957年上半年下降了10.8％，英国下降了
  2％；他们的钢、生铁、原煤等主要产品，都比去年萎缩衰落了。
    资本主义国家的报纸，看到我国人民大跃进的伟大成就，有的惶惶不安地说，“红色的工业巨龙正在向前奔腾，直冲云霄”，有的惊呼经济力量的“奥林匹克竞赛已经开始了”。那么，在这个奥林匹克
  “跑道”上，赛跑的纪录是怎样的呢？有关部门的资料表明，在第一个五年计划期内，我国钢产量已经从第十三位跑到第九位，赶过了五个资本主义国家：1953年赶过了两个，1954年赶过了一个，1956年又赶过了两个。而今年，我们又将肯定地再赶过两个资本主义国家。此外，我国的生铁产量，第一个五年内也赶过了三个资本主义国家；发电量，赶过了八个资本主义国家；水泥，赶过了三个资本主义国家。……
    而特别令人自豪的还是在今年。展览会上表明，预计今年我国的钢产量将由去年的五百三十五万吨跳到一千零七十万吨；发电量由一百九十三亿度跳到二百七十五亿度；煤由一亿三千万吨跳到二亿一千万吨……。而老牌的英帝国，在和我国今年相当的那些年代里是怎样的境况呢？它的钢从五百一十一万吨增长到一千零二万吨，一共用了三十一年；它的煤从一亿二千多万吨增长到二亿吨，用了七十五年；它的电发展算是快的，从一百八十八亿度增长到二百七十七亿度，也用了四年。事实就是这样明显地摆着：我们在一年内做完的事情，英国费了四年、三十一年甚至七十五年。
    展览会上无数无可争辩的事实，回答了人们一个问题：我国工业，特别是在今年大跃进当中，为什么能够以这样神奇的速度向前猛进？借用一句成语：众人拾柴火焰高。今天，办工业已经成为我国一个全民的运动。
    看一看钢铁元帅是怎样升帐的吧。展览会上有一幅全国钢铁工业布点图，看着真叫人心花怒放。从1950年到1957年的八年当中，冶金工业部新建、扩建的钢铁企业有一百多个，而现在已经是星罗棋布、花开满园了。今年一年，全国要新建成和继续进行建设的钢铁企业，将达二百一十五个。其中有大型的，有中小型的；有红花，有绿叶。而各地已经决定在今年兴建的数十万座土高炉，尚未计入。这些土高炉到8月底已经建成了二十四万多座了。
    仅仅在两个月以前，河南省还没有炼过一吨钢。可是现在，全省已经建成了三万多座土高炉和土洋结合的小高炉，一千数百座小转炉和土转炉，铁水、钢水已经奔流在河南平原，不仅炼出了普通钢，而且也炼出了高级钢了。全省组织了近一百万人，投入钢铁生产。展览会的人告诉我，中岳嵩山脚下的登封县人民，原来没有一吨铁，他们深感“手无寸铁、一事无成”的痛苦，今年春天在全县开展了一个工业建设运动。从县委书记到几十岁的老大娘，成百上千的人上山查矿、采矿，学炼铁，不到两个月，全县建成了二百多座土高炉。有一个马裕乡，砌筑高炉缺少猪毛作?子，大家都很焦急。这件事被乡妇联主任、青年团员屈松省知道了，她就毅然地剪下了自己蓄了很久的发辫，献给土高炉作?子。这件事感动了马裕乡的男女老少，接着有一千八百多个妇女都剪下发辫，献给了土高炉……。
    像屈松省这样的人，他们怀着一颗对社会主义工业化赤诚的心，他们热烈地向往社会主义工业化的美好前景，在我国何止千千万？在前进的道路上，还有什么困难，他们不能克服？
    煤炭馆里展出了另一个全民办工业的范例：盛产瓷器的湖南醴陵县，四十八个乡在今年短短几个月里，已经办起了一百多个煤矿，每天能生产五百多吨煤。这样，不仅全县的瓷窑和家家户户农民都有煤烧了，而且还能支援附近新兴的工业城市株洲了。当然，醴陵县不过是一个例证而已，由于全民办煤矿了，今年一年，全国新建煤井的生产能力，将超过第一个五年计划全部新建煤井的产量。
    像河南省，登封县，醴陵县一样，全国二十多个省、直辖市、自治区，二千多个县、自治县，今天都是干劲冲天，在工业化的道路上奋勇飞奔。
    任何人都可以从展览会上鲜明地看到，党的社会主义建设的总路线，全党办工业、全民办工业的方针，工业和农业同时并举，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针，今天已经为亿万人民群众所掌握，并且已经产生了巨大的物质力量——国家工业化的进程加速了。
    我们怀着无限激动、兴奋的心情，走出展览馆巍峨的建筑物，每个人都感到是满载而归。北京初秋的阳光显得格外明亮，映耀着八十公尺高的镏金铁塔，发出闪闪金光。瞻仰展览馆圆柱大厅顶上象征着荣誉的桂树树叶，我们对在加速工业建设进程中，成千上万建勋立功的英雄们肃然起敬。
    这时，我记起最近“自由罗马尼亚报”一篇题为“一天等于二十年”的文章来，作者用充沛的热情欢呼我国工农业大跃进的成就说：“当多少年以后的史学家描述起我们时代的面貌时，他一定会从如此值得骄傲的事实中挑出一件最令人自豪的事：社会主义国家经济发展的速度。”“受过几世纪掠夺和压迫的人民，正在以几年的时间完成着过去几十年、几百年所未完成的事情。”
    我们欢呼：我们的祖国已经跨进马克思在九十五年前所预言的“一天等于二十年”的伟大时代，我们欢呼：我们伟大祖国社会主义建设的速度万岁！
