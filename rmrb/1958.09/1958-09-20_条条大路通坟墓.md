Perhaps some people don't believe that the American aggressors, who adhere to the philosophy of "I would rather betray the world than let the world betray me," would willingly commit suicide. However, it is a fact that the American aggressors, who consider themselves extremely clever, are "putting a noose around their own necks" and handing one end of the noose to China and the anti-imperialist, anti-war people of the world.

In the Middle East, the situation for U.S. imperialism is very bad: If it doesn't act, the tide of national independence movements in the Middle East cannot be suppressed, and colonialism will be finished. If it does act, it will be met with the crisp slaps of the people of the world ordering it to withdraw its troops, putting itself in unprecedented isolation worldwide; and the unity of the Arab countries will be even tighter, and the Arab national liberation movement will be even more turbulent. -- The noose is tightened a little more.

The situation in the Taiwan Strait is even more so: If it doesn't act, relying solely on its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the clownish antics cannot maintain the situation; the "encirclement" of China, painstakingly arranged by U.S. imperialism, will have to "kick the bucket." So it acts, deploying the navy and air force, in a grand manner. But what it provokes is the nationwide armament of China, Khrushchev's warning, and a chorus of condemnation from all over the world, making its "allies" even more distant. -- The noose is tightened even further.

The hideous face of U.S. imperialism, the paper tiger essence of U.S. imperialism, is thus exposed to the people of the world again and again, preparing conditions for its own demise again and again. If U.S. imperialism really dares to impose war on our heads in the Taiwan Strait, it would be tantamount to further announcing its own doomsday.

Imperialism is thus at a dead end: inaction means death; action means even more death. Imperialism truly finds that "every road leads to the grave," and the laws of history are ruthless. Putting a noose around its own neck is not a matter of whether imperialism wants to, is willing to, or is ready to, but rather an objective law at play. -- This is what is called the inevitability of the demise of imperialism.

    条条大路通坟墓
    章沛
    也许有人不相信，奉行“宁肯我负天下人，不叫天下人负我”哲学的美国侵略者，竟会愿意自杀。但是，自以为聪明绝顶的美国侵略者“自套绞索”，并且把绞索的一端交给中国以及反帝、反战的世界人民，却又是事实。
    在中东美帝国主义的处境很不妙：自己不出手吧，中东的民族独立运动的浪潮就压不下去，殖民主义就将完蛋。出手吧，招来的是全世界人民喝令它撤军的清脆耳光，使自己在全世界陷于空前的孤立；而阿拉伯国家的团结却更紧密了，阿拉伯民族解放运动更汹涌澎湃了。——绞索勒得又紧了一些。
    在台湾海峡更是这样：自己不出手，光靠走狗蒋介石集团吧，小丑跳梁，无法维持局面；美帝国主义处心积虑布置的对中国的“包围圈”就得“呜呼哀哉”。那就出手吧，调海军调空军，煞有介事。但招来的却是中国的全民武装，赫鲁晓夫的警告，全世界一片谴责声，弄得“盟邦”也更加远离。——绞索又勒得更紧了一些。
    美帝国主义的狰狞面目，美帝国主义的纸老虎原形，就是这样一次又一次地暴露在全世界人民的面前，一次又一次地为自己的灭亡准备着条件的。假如，美帝国主义真的敢于在台湾海峡把战争强加到我们的头上，那就等于进一步宣布了它自己的末日。
    帝国主义就是这样的走投无路：不动手，死路；动手，更是死路。帝国主义真是“条条大路通坟墓”，历史的规律是无情的。自套绞索，不是出于帝国主义的想不想、愿不愿、肯不肯，而是客观规律在起作用。——这就叫作帝国主义灭亡的必然性。
