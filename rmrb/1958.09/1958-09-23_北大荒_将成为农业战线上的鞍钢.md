    "Great Northern Wilderness" Will Become the Anshan Iron and Steel of the Agricultural Front
    Question: We are a group of young people from society who are very interested in going to the "Great Northern Wilderness" to cultivate wasteland and increase grain production for the motherland. However, before going, we would like to know the specific situation there. Please provide us with some answers.
    Answer: Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the state farm enterprise is leaping forward. The Ministry of State Farms plans to reclaim approximately 100 million mu of wasteland during the Second Five-Year Plan period, which is equivalent to the arable land area of England or Japan. The key areas are the Mishan and Hoolingol Reclamation Areas in the "Great Northern Wilderness."
    The Mishan and Hoolingol Reclamation Areas are located south of the Heilong River, west of the Ussuri River, on both banks of the lower reaches of the Songhua River, and in the southeastern region of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, belonging to the Hoolingol Plain. The soil is fertile, the wilderness is vast, and there are about 4.04 million hectares (more than 60 million mu) of reclaimable land. Here, the average annual temperature is 2 to 3.5 degrees Celsius, and the annual rainfall is 500 to 600 millimeters, concentrated in June, July, and August. The frost-free period is 125 to 145 days. During the crop growing season, rainfall is abundant, and the temperature is suitable for the growth and development of crops and the breeding of various livestock, especially suitable for the growth of trees.
    Within the reclamation area, rivers and lakes are scattered like stars. It is rich in chum salmon. Many schools of fish have never seen people, so catching them is as easy as lifting a hand.
    Almost all the farms in the Mishan Reclamation Area were established in the last year or two. Currently, fifteen farms have been established, reclaiming 2.6 million mu of arable land. Although the Hoolingol Reclamation Bureau was only established this year, it already has a certain mechanical foundation. There are currently fifteen large farms and a provincial-level Boli stud farm. The equipment and strength are very strong. The famous China-Soviet Friendship Farm is located in this reclamation area. This spring, 70,000 to 80,000 demobilized military officers participated in the construction of these two major reclamation areas. Together with their families, they have added a labor force of more than 100,000 to the reclamation area.

### “北大荒”将成为农业战线上的鞍钢

    “北大荒”将成为农业战线上的鞍钢
    问：我们是一群社会青年，很想到“北大荒”去垦荒，为祖国增产粮食。但去以前，很想了解一下那里的具体情况，请给以解答。
    答：在总路线的光辉照耀下，农垦事业正在飞跃前进。农垦部预定要在第二个五年计划期内开垦一亿亩左右的荒地，也就是要开出相当一个英国或日本的耕地面积来。其中以“北大荒”的密山和合江垦区为重点。
    密山和合江垦区位于黑龙江以南，乌苏里江以西，松花江下游两岸，小兴安岭东南地区，属于合江平原。土质肥沃，荒原辽阔，可垦荒地约四百余万公顷（六千多万亩）。这里，年平均气温为摄氏二度到三度半，年降雨量为五百到六百公厘，降雨集中在6、7、8月份。无霜期有一百二十五天到一百四十五天。在作物生长期雨量充沛，气温相宜，适于农作物生长发育和各种畜类的饲养繁殖，尤适于林木的滋长。
    垦区内，河流湖泊星罗棋布。盛产大马哈鱼。很多鱼群因从来没有见过人，所以捕捞起来真是举手可得。
    密山垦区全部农场，几乎是最近一两年内才建立起来的。目前，已建立了十五个农场，开垦耕地二百六十万亩。合江垦区虽在今年才成立农垦局，但已有一定的机械化基础。现有十五个大型农场，一个省属勃利种马场，设备和力量均非常雄厚。著名的中苏友谊农场，就在这个垦区。今春，有七、八万转业军官参加了这两大垦区的建设。连同他们的家属在内，为垦区增加了十万以上的劳动大军。
