    The Great Way to Create New People
    Liu Feng
    The "Instructions on Educational Work" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council clearly point out: "Participating in productive labor is beneficial to students in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education. This is a correct path for cultivating well-rounded new people."
    The moral, intellectual, and physical education mentioned here are completely different from what the bourgeoisie referred to as moral, intellectual, and physical education in the past. Different standpoints and different classes have completely different, even opposite, views on the three educations.
    The bourgeois intellectuals cultivated in the past society through the method of separating education from labor only possessed half-baked, one-sided knowledge, but they themselves thought they had remarkable learning. Therefore, they considered themselves the most remarkable people in the world, possessing a sense of superiority superior to others. They believed that the working people were lowly. They looked down on labor, discriminated against the working people, and openly promoted the reactionary theories of "all other professions are inferior, only studying is superior," and "those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others," cultivating a viewpoint of opposition to the working people. Our view of moral education is the opposite of this, believing that labor is a heroic and bold undertaking. We take the excellent qualities of the working class and the noble feelings of the working people as morality. In the labor production of work-study programs, the broad masses of students saw the noble qualities of workers who loved labor, worked conscientiously and responsibly, loved the factory as their home, and were sincere to their comrades. Thus, fundamental changes took place in their thinking, changing their wrong ideas and establishing proletarian thoughts and feelings. This is precisely where the working class's view of moral education is completely opposite to that of the bourgeoisie.
    The people cultivated in the old society only had book knowledge and did not engage in productive labor. They only knew how to talk on paper, and were actually the most unknowledgeable "waste materials." In the old society, a small number of people could study from the age of six or seven, all the way to studying abroad, until their thirties. The best years of their lives were spent in school, but they made no contribution to society. They didn't know how to do what they learned. What they learned collapsed as soon as it came into contact with reality. They were merely putting on a show with the titles of scholars, experts, and professors, indulging in self-admiration. Using such learning to teach people is just copying mechanically, spreading errors and misleading students; if used for research, it is a castle in the air, splitting hairs, and of no help to reality. Our education is combined with productive labor, which is the opposite of this. We learn in order to use, and only learn in order to use; it is not learning for the sake of learning, nor teaching for the sake of teaching. It is learning while using, and using while learning. We must have both book knowledge and experience in productive labor. In short, we must master complete knowledge. Such education will not only not reduce the quality of teaching, but will also ensure the quality of teaching, improve the quality, and cultivate young people into socialist builders with both theory and practical skills.
    Our policy of combining education with productive labor is also different from the physical education of the old education system. The old education system cultivated weak and sickly scholars who could not withstand any wind or rain. They were more than capable of playing the role of "young masters," but incapable of handling affairs. Our education aims to enable everyone to develop healthily in body and mind, to become a new type of laborer with both a sound mind and a strong physique.
    Combining education with productive labor is a correct path for cultivating well-rounded new people. This is precisely the great ideal of communists. As early as in the first volume of "Das Kapital," Marx said: "Such education, by combining productive labour with instruction and gymnastics, not only raises the efficiency of social production, but is the only method of producing fully developed human beings." This method has already begun to be realized here. How happy and proud people living in such an era should be!

    造就新人的大道
    刘丰
    中共中央、国务院发布的“关于教育工作的指示”中明确地指出：“参加生产劳动对学生来说，不论在德育、智育或体育方面都有好处，这是培养全面发展的新人的一条正确道路。”
    这里所说的德育、智育、体育和过去资产阶级所说的德育、智育、体育完全是两回事。不同的立场，不同的阶级，对三育的看法也完全两样，甚至相反。
    过去的社会用教育与劳动相割裂的方法培养出来的资产阶级知识分子，只有一知半解的片面知识，但他们自己却以为有了不起的学问，于是就自以为是天下最了不起的人，具有高人一等的优越感。他们认为劳动人民是低贱的，他们看不起劳动，歧视劳动人民，公然宣传“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”，“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的反动理论，培养和劳动人民对立的观点。我们对于德育的看法和这相反，认为劳动是英勇豪迈的事业。我们以工人阶级的优秀品质、劳动人民的高贵感情为德。广大学生在勤工俭学的劳动生产中，看到了工人们热爱劳动，工作认真负责，爱厂如家，对同志真诚等等高贵品质，于是在思想上起了根本的变化，改变了错误想法，树立了无产阶级思想感情。这正是工人阶级对德育的看法和资产阶级完全相反的地方。
    旧社会培养出来的人，光有书本知识，不从事生产劳动，只会纸上谈兵，其实是最没有知识的“废料”。在旧社会里少数人可以从六、七岁就读书，一直读到留学，读到头三十岁，人生最好的年华都在学校中度过，对社会可毫无贡献。学那一行不会干那一行，所学的东西一接触到实际马上就垮了。他们只是挂了学者、专家、教授的头衔摆样子。自我欣赏。这样的学问用来教人是依样画葫芦，以讹传讹，误人子弟；如进行研究就是空中楼阁，钻牛角尖，于实际无补。我们的教育是和生产劳动结合，则一反其道。我们是学为了用，为了用才去学；不是为学而学，也不是为教而教，它是边学边用，边用边学；既要有书本的知识，也要有生产劳动的经验，总之要掌握完全的知识。这样的教育不仅不会降低教学质量，而且反保证了教学质量，提高了质量，把青年培养成既有理论又有实际本领的社会主义建设者。
    我们的教育和生产劳动结合的方针，对于体育来说也是和旧教育制度的体育不同的。旧教育制度培养出来的是弱不经风的白面书生，经不起任何的风霜雨雪，充“相公”有余，办事不足。我们的教育则是使人人身心得到健全的发展，要成为既有健全的头脑，又有坚强体魄的新型的劳动者。
    教育和生产劳动相结合是培养全面发展的新人的一条正确道路，这正是共产主义者伟大的理想。马克思早在“资本论”第一卷中就说过：“这种教育使每一个已达一定年龄的儿童，都把生产劳动和智育体育结合起来，这不仅是增加社会生产的一个方法，并且是培养全面发展的人类的唯一方法。”这种方法已经在我们这儿开始实现了。生活在这样时代的人，该是多么幸福和骄傲啊！
