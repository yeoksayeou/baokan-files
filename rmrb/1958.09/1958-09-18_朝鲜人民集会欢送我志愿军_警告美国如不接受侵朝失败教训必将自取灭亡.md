More than 40,000 people in North Hwanghae Province, Korea, at a grand rally on the evening of the 16th to see off the third group of returning Chinese People's Volunteers, shouted angrily and waved their arms, "Yankee Imperialists Get Out of Taiwan!"

    The conference was held in Sariwon. Mun Seok-bul, Chairman of the North Hwanghae Provincial Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, said in his speech at the meeting that the U.S. imperialists' recent creation of war provocations in the Taiwan Strait is not only an invasion of China but also a threat to peace in Korea and the Far East.

    新华社平壤17日电　朝鲜黄海北道四万多人民16日晚上在欢送中国人民志愿军第三批归国部队盛会上，一齐愤怒地振臂高呼：“美帝国主义从台湾滚出去”“朝中人民的友谊团结万岁”等口号，热烈支持中国人民的正义斗争。
    这个大会在沙里院市举行。朝鲜劳动党黄海北道委员会委员长文石佛在大会上讲话时说，美帝国主义最近在台湾海峡制造战争挑衅，这不仅是侵略中国也是对朝鲜和远东世界和平的威胁。如果美帝国主义者无视朝中人民和全世界爱好和平人民的警告，不接受朝鲜战争的教训，它将自取灭亡。
    黄海北道和沙里院市人民怀着无限的深情欢送中国人民志愿军。16日，他们把中国人民志愿军大街打扫得干干净净，一队队的工人、农民、学生打着朝中两国国旗，捧着一束束的鲜花来到志愿军大街旁边的广场上集会欢送友人。黄海北道人民委员会委员长郭瑞在会上代表全道人民向志愿军代表献旗献礼。
    以颜金生将军为首的四十多名中国人民愿志军第三批归国部队代表参加了今天的大会。颜金生将军在会上讲了话，对黄海北道人民战时、战后对志愿军的大力支援表示衷心感谢。颜金生将军还代表志愿军第三批部队向黄海北道人民献礼。
    会后，欢送群众和志愿军代表一块歌舞联欢，互表依依惜别之情。
