Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 31st: The "Rodong Sinmun" of Korea published a commentary today, firmly demanding that the US imperialists immediately stop their military provocations in the Taiwan Strait.
    The commentary said that people all over the world firmly condemn the US imperialists for intensifying various provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait.
    The commentary said that these provocative actions by the US imperialists are not only hostile acts against the Chinese people, but also another blatant challenge to peace. Taiwan and other coastal islands are an inalienable part of Chinese territory. No one is allowed to interfere in any issues concerning these islands. The People's Republic of China has every right to take measures to stop aggressive actions in the Taiwan Strait.
    The commentary pointed out that the US imperialists intend to use these provocative actions to divert the attention of the world's people from the Middle East to another place, in order to evade withdrawing troops from the Middle East or delay these matters. The commentary said that today all peace-loving people stand on the side of the Chinese people. If the US imperialists continue to create provocative acts in the Taiwan Strait and around the world, threatening human security, then they can only dig their own grave.
    The commentary also condemned the hostile behavior of the British authorities in Hong Kong towards the Chinese people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, August 31st: Mongolia's "Unen" published a commentary on the 31st, condemning US imperialism for continuing to create international tensions and carrying out new provocative activities against China.
    The commentary pointed out that the US imperialist armed aggression against Lebanon had been severely condemned by the people of the world and the emergency meeting of the UN General Assembly. At present, the United States is delaying its withdrawal of troops from the Middle East on the one hand, and creating tension in the Near East on the other. The commentary said that the provocative activities carried out by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique against China in the Taiwan Strait are being severely hit by the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    The commentary also condemned the shameful and criminal activities of British military aircraft violating Chinese airspace and the British authorities in Hong Kong being hostile to the Chinese people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 30th: Romanian newspapers continued to publish commentaries today, condemning the US imperialist conspiracy of military provocation against China.
    The "Scînteia" commentary said that after the failure of the US and British aggression in the Middle East, the US imperialist lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, intensified its provocative activities against the People's China. Such provocative activity is carried out under the direct supervision of US advisors and generals. The commentary said that such provocations by the US and Chiang Kai-shek will not have any hope of victory and have already been met with a powerful counterattack by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. If the US ruling clique and its accomplices disregard the strength of the socialist camp and the wishes of the peace-loving people of the world, and insist on their adventurous policies, then they will inevitably suffer a tragic outcome.
      "Scînteia Tineretului" published a commentary entitled "Imperialist Provocations in the Far East Should Stop," saying that the US aggressive group's criminal act of using the political ghost of Taiwan to provoke the People's China was planned and prepared long ago by the US State Department. The first step in this criminal plan was to publish the US State Department's so-called memorandum of non-recognition of the People's Republic of China. This memorandum is undoubtedly a collection of lies and slanders. The second step in the US criminal plan is to use its lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, to carry out despicable provocations in order to intensify the situation in the Far East. The commentary said that this is part of the entire US anti-peace conspiracy.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 31st: Albania's "Bashkimi" published a commentary today entitled "The Provocateurs Are Playing with Fire Again," severely condemning the recent provocative actions of US imperialism in Singapore, especially in the Taiwan region. The commentary said that the imperialists should not forget the lessons of the Korean War.
    The commentary pointed out that while the UN General Assembly has not yet dealt with the Middle East issues of the British and American imperialism, the US rulers have created new tensions in the East and attempted to shift the blame onto the People's China. The commentary said that the US aggressors are attempting to create a new source of war in the Taiwan region. However, the 600 million Chinese people will not be intimidated by the bluster of the Americans and can inflict devastating blows on all aggressors. All peace-loving people stand with the Chinese people. The commentary said that the Chinese people will never tolerate any intrusions by aggressors in front of their own homes. The Chinese people's struggle for the integrity of their territory, including Taiwan, is China's internal affair. They have never relaxed their struggle to unify the motherland and unify Taiwan, and the enemies of the Chinese people should always remember this fact.

　　社会主义阵营力量不可轻视
　　美国不停止挑衅将自掘坟墓
　　各兄弟国家舆论继续谴责美国威胁远东和平
    新华社平壤31日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论，坚决要求美帝国主义者立即停止在台湾海峡的军事挑衅。
    评论说，全世界人民坚决谴责美帝国主义者在台湾海峡加紧进行各种挑衅行动。
    评论说，美帝国主义者的这些挑衅行为不仅是对中国人民的敌对行为；而且是对和平的又一个粗暴的挑战。台湾和其他沿海岛屿是中国领土不可分割的一部分。有关这些岛屿的一切问题决不容许任何人来干涉。中华人民共和国完全有权利采取措施阻止在台湾海峡的侵略行动。
    评论指出，美帝国主义者打算用这种挑衅行动来把世界人民的耳目从中近东地区转移到另外的地方去，以便回避从中近东撤军或者把这些事拖延下去。评论说，今天一切爱好和平的人民都站在中国人民这一边，如果美帝国主义者在台湾海峡和世界各处继续制造挑衅行为威胁人类的安全，那么它只能是自掘坟墓。
    评论并且谴责了香港英国当局敌视中国人民的行为。
    新华社乌兰巴托31日电　蒙古“真理报”31日发表评论，谴责美帝国主义继续制造国际紧张局势，对中国进行新的挑衅活动。
    评论指出，美帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩的行为曾经遭到世界人民和联合国大会紧急会议的严厉指责。目前，美国一面拖延从中东撤军，一面又在近东制造紧张局势。评论说，美国和蒋介石集团在台湾海峡向中国进行的挑衅活动，正在遭到中国人民的沉重打击。
    评论同时谴责了英国军事飞机侵犯中国领空和香港英国当局敌视中国人民的可耻的罪恶的活动。
    新华社布加勒斯特30日电　罗马亚尼各报今天继续发表评论，谴责美国帝国主义对中国进行的军事挑衅阴谋。
    “火花报”的评论说，在美英两国在中东的侵略遭到失败以后，美国帝国主义的走狗蒋介石集团就加紧了对人民中国的挑衅活动，这种挑衅活动是在美国的顾问和将军直接监督下进行的。评论说，美蒋的这种挑衅不会有任何胜利的指望，而且已经遭到了中国人民解放军的有力回击。如果美国统治集团及其帮凶无视社会主义阵营的力量和世界爱好和平人民的愿望，坚持其冒险政策，那么它们必然遭到可悲的结果。
      “青年火花报”以“帝国主义在远东的挑衅应该停止”为题发表评论说，美国侵略集团利用台湾的政治幽灵对人民中国进行挑衅的罪恶行为，是早就由美国国务院筹划和准备好了的。这个罪恶计划的第一步就是公布美国国务院所谓不承认中华人民共和国的备忘录。这份备忘录无疑地是集谎言和诬蔑的大成。美国罪恶计划的第二步是利用它的奴才蒋介石集团进行卑鄙的挑衅，以便加剧远东的局势。评论说，这是美国反对和平的全部阴谋的一部分。
    新华社地拉那31日电　阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”今天以“挑衅者又在玩火了”为题发表评论，严厉谴责美帝国主义最近在新加坡、特别是在台湾地区进行的挑衅行为。评论说，帝国主义者不应该忘记朝鲜战争的教训。
    评论指出，当联合国大会还没有处理完美英帝国主义侵略中近东的问题时，美国统治者又在东方制造了新的紧张局势，并且企图把责任推在人民中国身上。评论说，美国侵略者企图在台湾地区制造新的战争策源地。但是六亿中国人民是不会为美国佬的叫嚣所吓倒的，并且能够给予一切侵略者以毁灭性的打击。所有爱好和平的人们都同中国人民站在一起。评论说，中国人民决不能容忍侵略者在自己的家门前有任何的侵扰活动。中国人民为包括台湾在内的领土的完整而进行的斗争是中国的内政问题。他们从来都没有放松过统一祖国统一台湾的斗争，中国人民的敌人应该永远记住这一事实。
