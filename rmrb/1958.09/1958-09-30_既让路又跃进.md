Agriculture has achieved an all-round bumper harvest. The heavy industries, such as the steel industry and machinery, have already established a momentum of rapid development. Under this situation, what should the light industry do? Should it catch up quickly? Or should it take its time?

The raw materials of light industry mainly come from the countryside. This year's bumper harvest in agriculture provides favorable conditions for the great development of light industry. Light industry serves the people's lives and the production of heavy industry. The people's material and cultural living standards are improving day by day. It is expected that the purchasing power of farmers will greatly increase this year, and they demand the supply of more means of production and means of livelihood. After the great development of heavy industry, many new requirements have also been put forward for light industry. The situation is pressing, and light industry has to make a great leap forward quickly.

Some comrades say that the country is currently concentrating its efforts on giving priority to the development of heavy industries such as steel, machinery, and electricity, and transportation. The limited steel materials and machinery manufacturing capabilities are all given to the "marshals" and "pioneers." Although light industry has raw materials and a market, it has no equipment, and it cannot make a leap forward even if it wants to. Yes, in the era of taking steel as the key link and the whole people running the steel industry, the light industry sector does need to have the spirit of self-sacrifice of "stopping to give way" in terms of steel materials and equipment manufacturing, so that the "marshals" can quickly ascend their tents and the "pioneers" can quickly get on their horses. However, "stopping to give way" does not mean not making a leap forward. Socialist economy is an economy with unified planning. There is an inherent connection between industry and agriculture, between heavy industry and light industry, and between one industrial sector and another. Agriculture and heavy industry have already leaped forward greatly. How can light industry stand still?

Therefore, at present, the light industry sector should both give way to the "marshals" and make a leap forward itself. Everything depends on human effort. As long as you want to make a leap forward and take a positive attitude to solve difficulties, there will definitely be a solution.

Today's news in this newspaper about vigorously developing the silicate industry and using silicate raw materials to replace steel in manufacturing machinery and equipment points out a broad path. In fact, this path was pointed out as early as the National Light Industry Bureau Directors Conference held in Zhengzhou in mid-July this year. However, at that time, some people had not yet broken the superstition that "machinery must be made of steel" and their minds were not liberated. They believed that using silicate raw materials to replace steel in manufacturing machinery and equipment was "nonsense," a "desperate measure," and a temporary measure. Now, many light industrial equipment made of silicate raw materials have been successfully produced, some have been used to equip factories, and some have already produced products. Judging from the new products that have been successfully trial-produced, most of the equipment in light industry, except for the watch industry, can be made of silicate raw materials, and even some textile machinery can be made of silicate raw materials. Light industrial equipment made of silicate raw materials saves steel and has low costs, making it most suitable for industries run by counties, townships, and communes. Promoting the use of this equipment is very beneficial to the rapid blooming of light industry everywhere. Therefore, using silicate raw materials to manufacture machinery and equipment is by no means a temporary desperate measure, but a long-term revolutionary policy.

Not using steel to make machines is a revolution. We must use a revolutionary attitude and courage to promote the use of these machines and make a great leap forward in light industry as well.

    既让路又跃进
    孔桑
    农业全面大丰收了。钢铁工业、机械等重工业飞跃发展之势已成。在这种形势下，轻工业怎样办？是赶快跟上去呢？还是慢慢来？
    轻工业的原料主要来自农村，今年农业的大丰收，给轻工业的大发展提供了有利的条件。轻工业是为人民的生活服务和为重工业生产服务的。人民的物质和文化生活水平正在日益提高，预计今年农民购买力将有很大的提高，他们要求供应更多的生产资料和生活资料。重工业大发展以后，对轻工业也提出了许多新的要求。形势逼人，轻工业已不能不迅速来一个大跃进。
    有的同志说，当前国家正集中力量优先发展钢铁、机械、电力等重工业和交通运输业，有限的钢铁材料和机械制造能力都让给“元帅”和“先行官”了，轻工业虽然有原料、有市场，但没有设备，想跃进也没法跃进。是的，在以钢为纲，全民办钢铁工业的时候，在钢铁材料和设备制造方面，轻工业部门的确需要有“停车让路”的自我牺牲精神，让“元帅”快快升帐，让“先行官”快快上马。然而，“停车让路”并不等于不跃进。社会主义经济是有统一计划的经济，工业与农业之间、重工业与轻工业之间、这一个工业部门与另一个工业部门之间，都有着一种内在的联系。农业和重工业已经大大向前飞跃了，轻工业在原地踏步不前怎么成呢？
    所以，在当前，轻工业部门应该是既给“元帅”让路，自己又要跃进。事在人为，只要想跃进，并且以积极的态度去解决困难，办法是一定有的。
    今天本报发表的大力发展硅酸盐工业，利用硅酸盐原料代替钢铁制造机械设备的消息，给指出了一条宽阔的道路。其实这条道路，早在今年7月中旬在郑州召开的全国轻工业局长会议上就有人指出来了。不过，那时有些人对“制造机械必须用钢铁”的迷信还没有破除，思想没有解放，认为用硅酸盐原料代替钢铁制造机械设备是“胡闹”，是“出于不得已的穷对付”，是临时措施。现在，许多用硅酸盐原料制造的轻工业设备已经成功了，有的已用来装备工厂，并且已经生产出产品来。从现在试制成功的新产品来看，轻工业的设备，除钟表业外，大都可以用硅酸盐原料制造，甚至一部分纺织机械也可以用硅酸盐原料制造。用硅酸盐原料制造的轻工业设备，既节约钢材，成本又低，最适合于县、乡、社办工业用。推广使用这种设备，非常有利于轻工业的迅速遍地开花。所以说，利用硅酸盐原料制造机械设备，绝不是一种临时穷对付的办法，而是一个长远的革命方针。
    不用钢铁制造机器，这是一种革命。我们必须用革命的态度和勇气来推广使用这些机器，使轻工业也来一个大跃进。
