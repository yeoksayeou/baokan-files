Dare to Compete with Professors
    Beijing Petroleum Institute Refining Department High-Efficiency Bactericide Group

    We are a group of young teachers and students from the Refining Department of Beijing Petroleum Institute. Recently, in order to trial-produce high-efficiency bactericides, we launched an intense competition with Professor Zhang Jin of the Organic Chemistry Teaching and Research Section at the school. The outcome was that we won the victory banner.

    High-efficiency bactericides can reduce sterilization time from about half an hour to a few minutes during surgical operations, with strong bactericidal capabilities but without damaging the skin. Not long ago, the People's Hospital entrusted Professor Zhang Jin with the task of trial-producing high-efficiency bactericides, but there was no progress for a long time. In order to make this medicine benefit the people as soon as possible, we proposed to cooperate with Professor Zhang Jin, but she flatly refused. She said, "This topic is very complex and not suitable for you to work on at all."

    We must stand up to defend the Party's scientific approach and defeat the "prestige" of bourgeois experts. Thanks to the strong support and care of the Party organization in the school, we formed a combat team of six Communist Party members, twelve Communist Youth League members, and one youth, and challenged Professor Zhang Jin.

    The competition began under conditions of vastly different strengths, both materially and technically. Professor Zhang Jin is a well-known figure in the chemical field, and manufacturing medicines is her specialty; under her leadership, there was a group of eight people, including lecturers, teaching assistants, and laboratory technicians, as her assistants; Professor Zhang Jin's personal scientific research funding accounted for 60% of the four chemistry teaching and research sections, and she had been running a "small warehouse" full of all kinds of things for a long time. In our group, besides three young teaching assistants and nine graduates from this year, the rest were second and third-year students and worker-peasant-soldier students who had just entered the university. In terms of equipment, we even had to borrow a thermometer from elsewhere. We knew that to achieve victory in the competition with bourgeois experts, the decisive factor was not technology and material conditions, but relying on politics in command, relying on the leadership of the Party, and relying on the strength of the collective. Professor Zhang Jin's purpose in doing research work was for personal fame and gain. In order to exclusively enjoy the research results, she did not allow colleagues working with her to be involved in the entire work process. We, on the other hand, had a clear political purpose, consciously followed the Party's line, and formed a strong collective. This obvious contrast was the reliable guarantee that we could defeat bourgeois experts.

    When we first went into battle, in order to find some clues about the manufacture of high-efficiency bactericides, we turned over books and consulted literature. As a result, we found nothing except a bactericide structural formula. At this time, the Party organization promptly pointed out that our research methods could not rely on consulting literature, and we must accumulate experience in practice. The next day, we divided into groups and used various methods for experimentation. On the same day, we preliminarily made an intermediate.

    In order to surpass Professor Zhang Jin in speed, we adopted a mass movement approach to work, working day and night in a blitzkrieg style. For example, when determining condensation conditions, we did not gradually increase or decrease the temperature and concentration, but started from the two extremes of maximum or minimum, greatly shortening the exploration time. In our work, when we felt that our energy was difficult to sustain, we immediately became energetic and threw ourselves into battle when we thought of the moans of patients on the operating table in the hospital and that we must achieve victory in the struggle between the two lines.

    The battle cry of "We must defeat bourgeois experts and safeguard the Party's policy of leading science" firmly united the wisdom and feelings of our nineteen people. Every experiment was discussed collectively. Everyone used their own experience to supplement and inspire each other, combining to form the experimental plan for each step. When looking for condensation conditions, after six consecutive failures, the whole group expressed great concern and encouraged each other, saying: "Let's try one more time, and if we succeed, we'll go to sleep!" After twenty-four hours of fighting, we finally achieved victory.

    While we were fighting hard, Professor Zhang Jin's research work was in a different situation. When we preliminarily trial-produced four kinds of high-efficiency bactericides in four and a half days, Professor Zhang Jin had only completed the first step of the four-step reagent work. In the end, she also stopped the trial production work on her own initiative. She failed in this competition.

    Under the leadership of the Party, we must continue to study diligently, give full play to collective wisdom, and conquer more scientific fortresses, and achieve more victories that bourgeois experts cannot achieve.

    敢和教授比高低
    北京石油学院炼制系高效杀菌剂小组
    我们是北京石油学院炼制系的一群年青师生。最近在学校里为试制高效杀菌剂，我们同有机化学教研室张锦教授展开了一场紧张的竞赛。结局是我们赢得了胜利的红旗。
    高效杀菌剂在医疗上实行外科手术时能使消毒时间由半小时左右缩短到几分钟，杀菌能力强，但不损伤皮肤。不久以前，人民医院把试制高效杀菌剂的工作委托给张锦教授，但迟迟没有进展。为了使这一药剂早日造福于人民，我们提出和张锦教授合作，她却断然拒绝。她说：“这个题目很复杂，根本不适合你们作。”
    我们必须挺身捍卫党的办科学的路线，打垮资产阶级专家的“威风”。由于学校里党组织的大力支持和关怀，我们六个共产党员、十二个共青团员和一个青年组成了战斗小组，对张锦教授挂起了应战牌。
    不论在物质或技术方面，竞赛都是在力量恳殊的条件下开始的。张锦教授是化学界的有名之士，制造药剂是她的专长；在她的领导下有一个由讲师、助教和实验员共八人组成的小组，作为她的助手；张锦教授个人的科学研究经费占四个化学教研室的60％，长期以来，经营起一座无奇不有的“小仓库”。在我们小组中，除了三个青年助教、九个今年的毕业生以外，其余都是二、三年级和刚考入大学的工农调干学生。在设备上连一支温度计也要到别处借用。我们知道，在同资产阶级专家竞赛中要取得胜利，起决定作用的不是技术和物质条件，而是依靠政治挂帅，依靠党的领导和集体的力量。张锦教授搞研究工作的目的是为了个人名利。她为了独享研究成果，不让一同工作的同志过问整个工作情况。而我们有明确的政治目的，自觉地遵循着党的路线，结成一个坚强的集体，这一显明对比就是我们能够战胜资产阶级专家的可靠保证。
    初上火线时，我们为了探寻出一些有关制造高效杀菌剂的线索，就翻书本、查文献。结果，除了找到一个杀菌剂结构式以外，毫无所获。这时党组织及时指出我们的研究方法不能依靠查文献，必须在实践中积累经验。第二天，我们就分小组采用各种方法进行试验。当天就初步作出了一种中间体。
    为了在速度上超过张锦教授，我们采用了群众运动的方式进行工作，日日夜夜突击式地进行。如作缩合条件时，我们不是逐步地增减温度和浓度，而是从最大或最小的两极端开始，大大缩短了摸索时间。在工作中，当感到精力难以支持时，我们一想到医院里手术台上病人的呻吟，想到必须在两条路线的斗争中取得胜利，就立即精神抖擞地投入战斗。
    “一定要战胜资产阶级专家，维护党领导科学的方针”的战斗口号把我们十九个人的智慧和感情牢固地扭在一起。每一步试验，都经过集体的讨论。每人都用自己的经验互相补充、互相启发，合起来形成每一步的试验方案。当找缩合条件时，连续六次失败，全组都表示出极大的关切，互相鼓励说：“再试一次，试成功了就睡觉吧！”经过二十四小时战斗，终于得到胜利。
    正当我们进行苦战的时候，张锦教授的研究工作却处在另一种状况。当我们用四天半时间初步试制成四种高效杀菌剂时，张锦教授却只完成四步试剂工作中的第一步。最后，她又自动停止了试制工作，她在这场竞赛中失败了。
    我们要在党的领导下，继续刻苦学习，发挥集体智慧，去攻克更多的科学堡垒，去取得更多的资产阶级专家们所不能取得的胜利。
