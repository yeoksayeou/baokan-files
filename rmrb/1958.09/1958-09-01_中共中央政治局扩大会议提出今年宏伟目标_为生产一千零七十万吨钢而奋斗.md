Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: The Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting in Beidaihe, Hebei Province, from August 17th to August 30th. The first secretaries of the Party committees from various provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities, as well as the responsible persons of the Party groups of relevant departments of the government, attended the meeting.

　　The meeting discussed the 1959 national economic plan, current industrial production, agricultural production and rural work issues, commercial work issues, educational policy issues, strengthening militia work issues, and other issues.

　　The meeting pointed out: The great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958 will bring the total output of food crops to 600 billion to 700 billion jin, an increase of 60% to 90% compared with 1957. The national average per capita food possession will reach about 1,000 jin; cotton will reach about 70 million dan, more than double the 1957 output. The great victory on the agricultural front requires the industrial front to catch up quickly, and also makes it possible for provincial-level Party committees to shift the focus of their attention to industry. Therefore, the meeting decided that the first secretaries of the Party committees of all provinces and autonomous regions must, from now on, first pay attention to the leadership of industry, but at the same time should not relax the leadership of agriculture.

　　The meeting pointed out: Industrial production and construction must first ensure the priorities. The central issue of industry is the production of steel and the production of machinery, and the development of machinery production depends on the development of steel production. Based on the current huge demand for steel by the people of the whole country and the huge efforts in steel production, and based on the fact that steel smelting equipment is increasing month by month and is rapidly being put into production, the leap-forward development of steel production is necessary and possible. According to the 1958 national economic plan adopted by the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress in February this year, this year's steel output is 6.2 million tons, an increase of 850,000 tons compared with last year. This figure has long seemed insufficient. At the end of May this year, the enlarged meeting of the Central Political Bureau suggested increasing this year's steel output to 8 million to 8.5 million tons. Now it seems that this figure is still too low. After discussion, the meeting decided to call on the whole Party and the people of the whole country to make the greatest efforts to produce 10.7 million tons of steel in 1958, which is double the 1957 output of 5.35 million tons.

　　The meeting preliminarily discussed the main indicators of the 1959 national economic plan. The meeting pointed out: 1959 is a decisive year for the three years of hard struggle by the people of the whole country. In 1959, it is required that China's industry and agriculture continue to advance at the speed of 1958 or at a higher speed than 1958, so as to ensure that the problem of the production and supply of grain, cotton, and oil crops in our country is completely solved in the shortest possible time, and fundamentally change the backward state of our country's industry in the shortest possible time.

　　High-speed, large-scale economic development requires, on the one hand, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses of the people, and on the other hand, strictly maintaining the planning and discipline of construction undertakings nationwide. The meeting believed that planning work should be managed at different levels, and local organizations at all levels should retain appropriate maneuvering rights; however, the plans at all levels must be components of the unified national plan, and local organizations at all levels must jointly be responsible for the national plan and work together under the centralized and unified leadership of the central government. The meeting discussed a series of measures concerning agricultural production this winter and next spring, centered on deep plowing, and made a decision.

　　The meeting enthusiastically discussed the issue of establishing people's communes in rural areas across the country. The meeting pointed out: Merging and transforming smaller agricultural production cooperatives into larger people's communes that integrate industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, combine townships and communes, and have a higher degree of collectivization, is the inevitable trend of the leap-forward development of rural production and the rapid improvement of farmers' awareness. The people's commune is the best organizational form for accelerating socialist construction and transitioning to communism, and will develop into the basic unit of future communist society. The establishment of people's communes must be based on the conscious and voluntary basis of the masses of the people and must be carried out through mass airing of views and debates.

　　The meeting discussed the principles of commercial work and the principles of educational work, and made decisions separately. The meeting also made decisions on strengthening militia work, cadres participating in physical labor, and continuing to carry out the movement to eliminate the four pests.

　　From August 25th to August 31st, the central government simultaneously convened an industrial production meeting attended by the secretaries of the Party committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities in charge of industry. At the industrial production meeting, specific discussions were held on strengthening the leadership and inspection of industrial production by Party committees at all levels, strengthening cooperation in all aspects, ensuring the completion of the 10.7 million tons of steel production plan, ensuring the completion of the production plans for metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, and heavy-duty machine tools, vigorously strengthening the production of copper and aluminum, and implementing tasks such as the whole people smelting copper and the whole people smelting aluminum.

    新华社31日讯　中国共产党中央政治局从8月17日到8月30日在河北省北戴河举行了扩大会议。各省、自治区、直辖市党委第一书记和政府各有关部门党组的负责人员参加了这次会议。
    会议讨论了1959年的国民经济计划、当前的工业生产、农业生产和农村工作问题、商业工作问题、教育方针问题、加强民兵工作问题和其他问题。
    会议指出：1958年农业生产的大跃进，将使粮食作物的总产量达到六千亿斤至七千亿斤，比1957年增产60％至90％，
  全国每人占有粮食的平均数将达到一千斤左右；棉花将达到七千万担左右，比1957年增产一倍以上。农业战线的伟大胜利要求工业战线迅速地赶上去，而且也使得省一级党委有可能把注意的重心转移到工业方面来。因此，会议决定，全国的省和自治区党委的第一书记，从现在起，就必须首先注意工业的领导，但是同时不应当放松农业的领导。
    会议指出：工业的生产和建设必须首先保证重点。工业的中心问题是钢铁的生产和机械的生产，而机械生产的发展又决定于钢铁生产的发展。根据当前全国人民对于钢铁的巨大需要和对于钢铁生产的巨大努力，根据钢铁冶炼设备正在逐月增加和迅速投入生产的情况，钢铁生产的飞跃发展是必要的和可能的。按照今年2月第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议所通过的1958年国民经济计划，今年钢产量是六百二十万吨，比去年增产八十五万吨，这个数字早已显得不够了。今年5月底，中央政治局扩大会议建议把今年的钢产量增加到八百万吨至八百五十万吨。现在看来，这个数字仍然嫌低。会议经过讨论，决定号召全党和全国人民用最大的努力，为在1958年生产一千零七十万吨钢，即比1957年的产量五百三十五万吨增加一倍而奋斗。
    会议初步讨论了1959年国民经济计划的主要指标。会议指出：1959年是全国人民苦战三年的有决定意义的一年。在1959年，要求我国的工业和农业继续用1958年的速度或者比1958年更高的速度前进，这样就可以保证在最短期间彻底解决我国粮食、棉花、油料的生产和供应问题，并且在最短期间根本改变我国的工业落后状态。
    高速度的、大规模的经济发展，要求一方面充分发挥人民群众的积极性、主动性，另一方面严格保持全国范围的建设事业的计划性、纪律性。会议认为：计划工作应该分级管理，各级地方组织应该保有适当的机动权；但是各级的计划都必须是统一的全国计划的组成部分，各级地方组织都必须在中央的集中统一的领导下，对国家计划共同负责，共同努力。会议讨论了以深耕为中心的关于今冬明春的农业生产的一系列措施，并且作出了决定。
    会议热烈地讨论了在全国农村中建立人民公社的问题。会议指出：把规模较小的农业生产合作社合并和改变成为规模较大的、工农商学兵合一的、乡社合一的、集体化程度更高的人民公社，是目前农村生产飞跃发展、农民觉悟迅速提高的必然趋势。人民公社是加速社会主义建设和过渡到共产主义的一种最好的组织形式，并将发展成为未来的共产主义社会的基层单位。人民公社的建立必须是在人民群众自觉自愿的基础上，必须通过群众的鸣放辩论。
    会议讨论了关于商业工作的方针和教育工作的方针，并且分别作出了决定。会议还对加强民兵工作、干部参加体力劳动、继续开展除四害运动等问题作出了决定。
    从8月25日到8月31日，中央同时召集了由各省、自治区、直辖市党委管工业的书记参加的工业生产会议。在工业生产会议上，具体讨论了加强各级党委对工业生产的领导和检查，加强各方面的协作，保证完成一千零七十万吨钢的生产计划，保证完成冶金设备、发电设备、重型机床的生产计划，大力加强铜铝的生产，实行全民炼铜、全民炼铝等项任务。
