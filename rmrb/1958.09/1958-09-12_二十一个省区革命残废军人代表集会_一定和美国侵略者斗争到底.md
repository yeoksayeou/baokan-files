Xinhua News Agency, Xinxiang, 10th. Representatives from twenty-one provinces and regions attending the national on-site meeting on the work of revolutionary disabled soldiers' sanatoriums, held here, gathered to express their great indignation at the US imperialist military provocations in the Taiwan Strait and their determination to fight the American aggressors to the end!

This meeting was convened by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The more than seventy representatives participating in the meeting were mostly officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who had been wounded and shed blood for the revolution and had performed meritorious service. Qiu Qiang, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Sanatorium, said: "For the liberation of the motherland, many comrades were wounded, disabled, and even sacrificed their lives. We feel the motherland is most lovable, and peace is precious, and we must not allow any enemy to come and destroy it!" Li Ke, Director of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Sanatorium, and others said: "US imperialism has always been the deadly enemy of the Chinese people. It hasn't paid its old debts to us, and it dares to provoke us again. This is absolutely intolerable! We are soldiers who have been tested in war, and we will beat them until they are as battered and bloodied as they were on the Korean battlefield!" Many people also stated on the spot that if the American aggressors dare to provoke a war, they will immediately take up their weapons and return to the front lines. Chen Zhongxian, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Civil Affairs Department, an old Red Army soldier who commanded a company in the Anshunchang battle during the 25,000-li Long March, said: "Although my left leg was crippled by an American bullet in the War of Liberation, my heart is not crippled. If the American aggressors dare to provoke a war, I will take up my weapons and go to the front lines, and I will never give up until I destroy them!"

Xinhua News Agency, Xinxiang, 10th. The convalescents of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Sanatorium unanimously expressed their intolerance of the provocative actions of the American aggressors.

Under the meticulous care and attention of the Party and the People's Government, the physical condition of the one hundred and ninety-three severely disabled convalescents in this sanatorium has greatly improved. At present, they are determined to make great efforts in production and construction, despite their disabilities. After hearing the broadcast of Premier Zhou's statement, they unanimously expressed their warm support and denounced the military provocative acts of US imperialism. On the evening of the 7th, they and their families held a gathering. Li Wenzhong, who was blinded in both eyes in the Korean War, Pang Yongxun, who was wounded and disabled in the War of Liberation, and Zhou Yunlong, who lost a leg in the War of Liberation, all angrily said at the meeting: "Our disabilities were all caused by US imperialism. Our old hatred has not been avenged, and new hatred has come again, we really cannot tolerate it." They expressed that they would redouble their efforts to complete their production tasks and use practical actions to strike at US imperialism. On the 8th, many convalescents,拄着拐杖or坐着手摇三轮车 (using crutches or sitting in hand-cranked tricycles), also participated in the demonstration parade held in Xinxiang City.

    新华社新乡10日电　参加在此间召开的全国革命残废军人教养院工作现场会议的二十一个省、区的代表，举行集会，对于美帝国主义在台湾海峡的军事挑衅罪行表示极大愤怒，决心要和美国侵略者斗争到底！
    这个会议是内务部召开的，参加会议的七十多名代表，绝大部分都当过中国人民解放军的军官，为革命负过伤流过血，立过战功。广东省革命残废军人教养院院长丘强说：我们为了祖国的解放，许多同志负伤、残废甚至牺牲了性命。我们最感到祖国的可爱，和平的可贵，决不能让任何敌人前来破坏！云南省革命残废军人教养院院长李克等说：美帝国主义一直是中国人民的死敌，他欠我们的旧债没还，竟又敢来挑衅。这是绝对不能容忍的！我们是久经战争考验的战士，我们要打得他像在朝鲜战场上一样的头破血流！许多人并当场表示，如果美国侵略者胆敢挑起战争，我们就马上拿起武器，重返前线。在二万五千里长征中指挥一个连参加安顺场战斗的老红军、广东省民政厅副厅长陈忠献说：我的左腿虽然在解放战争中被美国子弹打残废了，但是我的心并不残废。如果美国侵略者胆敢挑起战争，我还要拿起武器走上前线，不把它消灭决不罢休！
    据新华社新乡10日电　河南省革命残废军人教养院的休养员们，对美国侵略者的挑衅行为一致表示不能容忍。
    这个教养院的一百九十三名重残废休养员，在党和人民政府无微不至的关怀照顾下，体质都大有好转。目前，他们正在抱着残而不废的决心，大搞生产建设。当他们听到周总理声明的广播以后，一致表示热烈拥护，并痛斥美帝国主义的军事挑衅行为。7日晚上，他们和家属们一起举行了集会。在朝鲜战场上负伤双目失明的李文忠、在解放战争中负伤残废的庞永勋、在解放战争中失去一条腿的周云龙等，都在会上愤怒地说：我们的残废都是美帝国主义造成的。我们的旧仇没报，新仇又来，我们实在不能容忍。他们表示要加倍完成生产任务，用实际行动来打击美帝国主义。8日，很多休养员又拄着拐杖或坐着手摇三轮车，参加了新乡市举行的示威游行。
