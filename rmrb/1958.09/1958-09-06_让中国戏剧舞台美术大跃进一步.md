Let Chinese Drama Stage Art Leap Forward Further
Commentator of this newspaper

The recent joint symposium held by the Chinese Dramatists Association and the Chinese Artists Association to overcome the backwardness of stage art in opera performances and to strengthen cooperation was timely and necessary.

Stage art is an important part of theatrical art. China's opera has won the love of the people and high international praise for its rich and excellent traditional repertoire and outstanding performing arts. This is also inseparable from its unique stage art. Splendid and danceable costumes; boldly simplified props that enhance performance effects; and the evocation of imagination to avoid cumbersome and realistic stage settings and scene descriptions are all valuable artistic creations of the Chinese people.

However, it is undeniable that due to the limitations of material and technical conditions in the old era, and because Chinese actors mainly seek the feeling of expressing time and place from singing and acting, Chinese stage art inevitably appears simple and backward compared to the actors' performing arts. With the import of drama forms and European stage art, Chinese opera's stage art has been enriched and improved. However, some opera troupes in large cities, influenced by bourgeois commercialization, have also messed around with mechanical sets, becoming bizarre and psychedelic, and entering the devil's path of art.

After liberation, through opera reform, the stage appearance has been completely renewed. First, through stage purification, ugly and backward things were removed. At the same time, some beneficial work was done on the artistic and modernization of the Chinese opera stage. However, the innovation of opera stage art has not received enough attention. The performances of many excellent traditional repertoires lack the embellishment of stage equipment commensurate with them, which makes people feel that there is something lacking. The stage equipment for repertoires that express modern life is often somewhat hasty. At the same time, some biases have occurred in stage art design, such as forcibly transplanting drama-style sets into opera; some cumbersome naturalistic things have destroyed the style of "stylized realism" of Chinese opera; violating the simple and concise spirit of the Chinese stage, stage art is not closely integrated with the needs of the plot and dance, forming extravagance and waste, and so on. Therefore, how to correctly use and innovate stage art has become one of the important tasks to improve the quality of opera performances.

We must raise the stage art of Chinese opera to the same height as its performing arts, so that opera art is more beautiful and complete.

We must apply the increasingly developed material and technical conditions in stage work according to the characteristics and needs of Chinese opera art, and constantly improve and improve the relatively simple or inappropriate stage art. It is necessary to adopt modern stage equipment, but also to have a national style, suitable for the performance techniques and content of our country's traditional opera; it is necessary to strive for the integrity of stage art, but also to be streamlined and economical, and to combine beauty and economy.

We can imagine, and can take the existing achievements as proof, how the excellent traditional Chinese opera repertoire will complement each other and exert greater artistic appeal once it is equipped with stage equipment that is completely adapted to its characteristics and needs. If the opera repertoire with modern production struggles and political struggles as themes is appropriately improved in terms of stage art, it will surely be more attractive and more persuasively educate the people in socialism and patriotism.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the opera circles have been enthusiastically and vigorously engaged in expressing the themes of socialist revolution and construction on the stage with full political enthusiasm and revolutionary vigor. There have been many new creations in script creation, performance skills, and stage art. We hope that opera workers will continue to work hard and make an all-round leap forward.

Although stage art is subordinate to the stage, it is important art work and should receive the constant attention and cooperation of art workers. Stage artists should continuously summarize experience, give play to the excellent traditional characteristics and new era colors, so that the political content and artistic form of Chinese opera are internally rich and externally full, complete and sufficient, and more powerfully serve socialist construction.

　　让中国戏剧舞台美术大跃进一步
　　本报评论员
    中国戏剧家协会和中国美术家协会最近为了克服戏曲演出上舞台美术的落后现象，加强协作，联合召开了一次座谈会，这是适时的，必要的。
    舞台美术是戏剧艺术重要的组成部分。我国的戏曲以其丰富优秀的传统剧目和卓越的表演艺术，赢得了人民的喜爱和国际的很高评价。这跟它的独特的舞台美术也是分不开的。像绚烂多彩、适于舞蹈的服装；大胆简化、增加表演效果的道具；唤起想像避开繁琐写实的砌末和情境描写等等，都是中国人民可贵的艺术创造。
    但是无可讳言，由于旧时代物质技术条件的限制，由于中国演员把表现时间地点的感觉主要求之于唱和做，因此中国舞台美术比起演员表演艺术来，就未免显得简陋落后。随着话剧形式和欧洲舞台美术的输入，中国戏曲的舞台艺术方面有了丰富和提高。但大城市的一些戏曲班社受了资产阶级商业化的侵袭，又乱搞机关布景，光怪陆离，走入艺术的魔道。
    解放以后，经过戏曲改革，舞台面貌焕然一新，首先是通过舞台净化，去掉了丑恶落后的东西，同时就中国戏曲舞台的艺术化、现代化做了一些有益的工作。但是对于戏曲舞台美术的革新还没有引起足够的重视。不少优秀的传统剧目的演出，由于缺乏与之相称的舞台装置的衬托而使人有美中不足之感。表现现代生活的剧目的舞台装置也往往有些草率。同时在舞台美术设计上发生了一些偏向，如在戏曲中硬搬话剧式的布景，某些繁琐的自然主义的东西破坏了中国戏曲“样式化的现实主义”的风格；违背中国舞台朴素简约的精神，舞台美术不紧密结合剧情和舞蹈需要，形成铺张浪费等等。因此如何正确地运用和革新舞台美术就成为提高戏曲演出质量的重要任务之一。
    我们一定要把中国戏曲的舞台美术提到跟它的表演艺术同样的高度，使戏曲艺术更美，更完整。
    我们要把舞台工作上日益发展的物质技术条件按照中国戏曲艺术的特点和需要加以运用，把较为简陋的或不恰当的舞台美术不断予以提高和改进。既要采用现代化的舞台装置，又要有民族风格，适合我国传统戏曲的表演手法和内容；既要争取舞台艺术的完整，又要精简节约，做到美观和经济相结合。
    我们可以想像，并可以拿已有的成就做证明，中国优秀的传统戏曲剧目一旦给配上完全跟它的特点和需要相适应的舞台装置该怎样相得益彰，发挥更大的艺术感染力。对于以现代生产斗争政治斗争为题材的戏曲剧目，如果加以适当的舞台美术方面的改进，一定更能引人入胜，更有说服力地对人民进行社会主义爱国主义的教育。
    大跃进以来，戏曲界在舞台上表现社会主义革命与建设的主题，是以饱满的政治热情和革命干劲踊跃从事的。在剧本创作、表演技巧和舞台美术上都有不少新的创造。我们希望戏曲工作者继续努力，全面跃进。
    舞台美术虽则从属于舞台，但是重要的美术工作，应该取得美术工作者的经常注意和协作。舞台美术家们应该不断总结经验，发挥优秀的传统特点和新的时代色彩，使中国戏曲的政治内容与艺术形式，内充外沛，圆满具足，更有力地为社会主义建设服务。
