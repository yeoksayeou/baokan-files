Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 14th dispatch: Swedish newspapers of various political leanings strongly criticized U.S. President Eisenhower's speech on the Taiwan Strait situation on the 11th.

    The "Morning News," the organ of the ruling Social Democratic Party, pointed out that "all the arguments in Eisenhower's speech are a distortion of the truth." The newspaper fiercely criticized the United States' support of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the provocative movements of U.S. warships in Chinese territorial waters. It also stated, "Taiwan is a threat to the Chinese people. This is why the U.S. President's arguments are not convincing." The newspaper further said that Eisenhower put forward preconditions, attempting to "preordain the failure of the (Sino-U.S.) Warsaw talks."

    The Conservative Party's "Svenska Dagbladet" pointed out that Eisenhower's reasoning was weak and untenable, especially when he compared the Quemoy crisis to the democratic countries' surrender to Hitler. The newspaper said that Quemoy and Matsu "have always belonged to the Beijing regime."

    The Liberal Party's "Dagens Nyheter" said that the Quemoy crisis cannot be compared to the Munich crisis.

Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, 13th dispatch, via TASS: The Danish bourgeois newspaper "Information" published an editorial fiercely criticizing U.S. President Eisenhower's speech on the Taiwan Strait situation.

    The newspaper wrote that no statement by the U.S. President has aroused such strong opposition from America's friends as this speech. The policy he announced may, in the worst case, lead to a Sino-U.S. war, which America's allies will certainly not recognize as justified, because this war may have extremely dangerous consequences for them.

    "Information" continued, Eisenhower's argument about the Far East crisis "not only contradicts the most prevalent view but also the most authoritative view in the world."

    Eisenhower said that "handing over" the coastal islands to the People's Republic of China would be "a repetition of Munich." The newspaper said that this is "purely an inflammatory propaganda trick."

    "Information" emphasized that the real reason for the Far East crisis is that the United States' initial misjudgment of China caused more and more and bigger mistakes. "As a result, the United States is getting deeper and deeper into errors, so that now it indulges Chiang Kai-shek's arrogant attempts, threatening world peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, 14th dispatch, via TASS: The Norwegian newspaper "Orientering" published an editorial criticizing the U.S.'s aggressive policy towards the People's Republic of China. When discussing the U.S.'s provocative behavior in the Taiwan area, the editorial wrote, "Everyone knows that the U.S.'s allies, with very few exceptions, disagree with the policy implemented by the Americans. ... Only reactionary rulers like Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek support this policy. America's prestige is declining day by day in other parts of the world precisely because of this policy. Is there any prominent politician who does not believe that the U.S. will sooner or later abandon its resistance to the new China?"

    The newspaper said: The upcoming United Nations General Assembly is a very good opportunity for Norway. It is hoped that the Norwegian government, together with other Nordic governments, will show initiative to restore China's legitimate status in the United Nations.

### 艾森豪威尔颠倒不了黑白  瑞典丹麦挪威舆论猛烈抨击美国总统的演说

    艾森豪威尔颠倒不了黑白
    瑞典丹麦挪威舆论猛烈抨击美国总统的演说
    据新华社14日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：瑞典各种政治倾向的报纸13日强烈抨击美国总统艾森豪威尔11日关于台湾海峡局势的演说。
    执政党社会民主党的机关报“晨报”指出，“艾森豪威尔演说中的全部论点都是颠倒黑白。”报纸猛烈抨击美国支持蒋介石集团的做法以及美国军舰在中国领海的挑衅性调动，它并且说，“台湾对中国人民是一个威胁。这就是为什么美国总统的论点不能令人信服的原因。”报纸还说，艾森豪威尔提出了一些先决条件，企图“事先使（中美）华沙谈判注定要失败”。
    保守党的“瑞典日报”指出，艾森豪威尔的推论的依据是软弱无力的，是不能成立的。特别是当他把金门的危机和民主国家向希特勒屈服的事情相比的时候更是如此。这家报纸说，金门和马祖“一向隶属于北京政权的”。
    自由党的“每日新闻”说，金门的危机和慕尼黑的危机是无法相比的。
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社哥本哈根13日讯：丹麦资产阶级报纸“新闻报”发表社论，猛烈抨击美国总统艾森豪威尔关于台湾海峡局势的演说。
    这家报纸写道，美国总统的任何一次声明都没有像这次演说这样引起美国朋友如此激烈的反对。他所宣布的政策在最坏的情况下可能会导致一场中美战争，而美国的盟国当然不会承认这场战争是正当的。因为这场战争可能对它们产生极其危险的后果。
    “新闻报”接着写道，艾森豪威尔对远东危机的论断“不仅同最普遍的看法相矛盾，而且也同全世界最权威的看法相矛盾”。
    艾森豪威尔说，把沿海岛屿“让给”中华人民共和国将是“慕尼黑的重演”，这家报纸说，这“纯粹是一种煽动性的宣传伎俩”。
    “新闻报”强调指出，造成远东危机的真正原因，是美国最初对中国的错误估计引起了后来越来越多和越来越大的错误，“结果美国在错误中愈陷愈深，以致现在它纵容蒋介石的狂妄企图，而使世界和平遭到威胁”。
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社奥斯陆14日讯：挪威“方针报”发表社论抨击美国对中华人民共和国的侵略政策。社论在谈到美国在台湾地区的挑衅行为时写道，“大家知道，美国的盟国，除了极个别的以外，都不同意美国人所实行的政策。……只有像李承晚和蒋介石之类的反动统治者支持这种政策。美国的威信正是由于这种政策而在世界的其他部分一天比一天下降。难道有哪一个著名的政治家会不认为美国早晚必将放弃对新中国的抵制的么？”
    报纸说：即将举行的联合国大会是挪威的一个非常好的机会，希望挪威政府同北欧其他各国政府表现出主动性，以使中国在联合国的合法地位恢复。
