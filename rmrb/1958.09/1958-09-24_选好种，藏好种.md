    Select Good Seeds, Store Good Seeds Well
    This year, we exchanged "3425," "Nan Rice," and other improved varieties from the Yutou Grain Station, and planted 250 mu. These rice seeds not only had many barnyard grasses, but more seriously, the varieties were mixed. Currently, among these 250 mu of rice, the early-maturing ones are already ripe and shedding grains; the late ones are just scattering seeds; and the latest ones are still clumps of green grass. Other communes nearby have similar situations.
    Now is the season for selecting seeds, keeping seeds, and purchasing seeds. In order to effectively prevent similar situations from happening again, it is hoped that the grain seed departments will pay attention to this problem in the selection, purchase, transportation, and storage of seeds in the future.

    选好种，藏好种
    今年我们向淤头粮站调换了“3425”、“南稻”等良种，种了二百五十多亩。这些谷种不仅稗子多，更严重的是品种混杂。目前这二百五十多亩水稻，早的已黄熟要掉粒；迟的刚散籽；最迟的还是一丛青草。附近其他社也有类似情况。
    目前正处于选种、留种和购种时节，为了切实防止再发生类似情况，希望粮食种籽部门，今后在选购、调运及保管种子方面应注意这个问题。
