Jingxi Kailuan Workers Decide Not to Take National Day Holiday
Increase Coal Production as a Gift
    (Our report) Two thousand workers from various mines under the Jingxi Mining Bureau have decided not to take the National Day holiday, and to produce more than 10,000 tons of coal for the country. This is their practical action to support the Marshal of Steel and counter the provocations of U.S. imperialism.
    The military provocations of the U.S. imperialists against our country have deeply angered the miners. Recently, they have held meetings one after another, requesting the leadership to allow them to continue production as usual during the National Day. The Chengzi Mine held a mass meeting on the 20th. The workers of the Excavation Team 14 requested the leadership to approve their request not to take a holiday on "October 1st" and to continue production as usual. After the meeting, more than 1,500 workers in the mine posted more than 60 big-character posters, unanimously requesting to contribute two days of holiday to produce more coal. The twenty-odd workers of Zhen Zhiqiang's team of the eleventh mining face went down to the mine two hours early on the day they expressed their determination. The project of moving the cable, which was originally planned to be completed in one day, was completed in only two hours, so that the eleventh mining face could be put into production ahead of schedule. The electromechanical workers of various mines under this bureau have also expressed their willingness to complete the "October 1st" maintenance tasks ahead of schedule. The Mentougou Mine needs 48 hours to complete the replacement of the can track in the maintenance shaft. After repeated discussions by the electromechanical workers, they decided to complete this task within 16 hours. The office cadres of various mines have also proposed to work as usual and go down to the mine on "October 1st".

    (Our Tianjin report, September 26th) The workers of Kailuan Coal Mine responded to the State Council's instructions on properly arranging civilian fuel and vigorously increasing the production of raw coal. At the mine-wide workers' high-yield and high-speed raw coal production mobilization meeting held on the 19th, all mine workers re-revised the annual production plan, proposed to carry out a high-yield competition, work hard for 100 days, and ensure the annual production of 12.5 million tons of coal, an increase of more than 2 million tons compared with the state plan, and an increase of 400,000 tons compared with the original leap forward plan. It also proposed not to take a holiday on National Day to produce more raw coal as a gift for National Day.

    At the mobilization meeting, the workers of the mine checked the previous stage of production leap forward, and achieved many achievements in carrying out technological revolution and organizing high production, and the output of raw coal continued to increase. However, there is still great potential in production. For example, on September 16, the daily output of the mine jumped from more than 37,000 tons to more than 41,800 tons. In order to make the average daily output jump to more than 40,000 tons and ensure the overfulfillment of the revised annual production leap forward plan, all mine workers unanimously decided at the meeting to carry out the raw coal high-yield competition, while strengthening production preparations such as tunneling and transportation, vigorously saving pit wood, and improving the utilization rate of machinery and equipment to solve the difficulties in the supply of pit wood equipment, and ensure that the average daily output of raw coal in late September increased by 5,000 tons compared with August, and the average daily output in the fourth quarter increased by 7,000 tons of raw coal. The workers attending the meeting also unanimously decided not to take a holiday on National Day and continue production as usual to present a gift for National Day.

    In order to realize the high-yield plan, the secretary of the Party committee of the mine personally took charge and formed a high-yield competition command to strengthen the leadership of the mine-wide high-yield competition.

    京西开滦职工决定国庆节不休假
    增产原煤作献礼
    本报讯  京西矿务局所属各矿的两万名职工决定国庆不休假，为国家多产一万多吨煤。这是他们支援钢铁元帅、反击美帝国主义的挑衅的实际行动。
    美帝国主义者对我国的军事挑衅行为深深激怒了矿工们。最近，他们纷纷举行集会，要求领导上准许他们在国庆节照常生产。城子矿在20日召开了群众大会。掘进十四组全组工人要求领导上批准他们“十、一”不休假，照常生产。会后，全矿有一千五百多名职工贴出了六十多张大字报，一致要求贡献两天假日，多生产煤。回采十一组甄志强班的二十多名工人，在表示决心的当天就提前两小时下井劳动，原计划一天完成的移动电缆的工程，只用了两小时就完成了，使这处回采工作面能提前投入生产。这个局所属各矿的机电工人也纷纷表示要提前完成“十、一”检修任务。门头沟矿检修井筒换罐道，需要四十八小时才能完成。经过机电工人的反复讨论，决心在十六小时内完成这项任务。各矿的科室干部也纷纷提出“十、一”要照常工作和下井劳动。
    本报天津26日电  开滦煤矿职工响应国务院关于妥善安排民用燃料指示，大力增产原煤的号召，全矿职工在19日召开的全矿职工高产高速增产原煤动员大会上，重新修改了全年生产计划，并提出开展高产竞赛，苦战一百天，保证全年生产一千二百五十万吨煤，比国家计划增产二百多万吨，比原订跃进计划增产四十万吨，并提出国庆节不休假多增产原煤为国庆献礼。
    在动员大会上，这个矿的职工检查了前一段生产跃进情况，在开展技术革命组织高产等方面取得了不少成绩，原煤产量不断提高。但是生产上仍有很大潜力，譬如9月16日全矿日产量由原来的三万七千多吨跃到四万一千八百多吨，为了使平均日产量跃到四万吨以上，保证超额完成修改后的全年生产跃进计划，全矿职工在会上一致决议开展原煤高产竞赛运动，同时加强掘进等生产准备和运输工作，大力节约坑木，提高机器设备利用率，解决坑木设备供应困难，保证在9月下旬平均每天原煤产量比8月份增加五千吨，到第四季度平均日产量增加七千吨原煤。到会职工还一致决定国庆节不休假照常生产，为国庆节献礼。
    为了实现高产计划，这个矿的党委书记亲自挂帅，组成高产竞赛指挥部，加强全矿高产竞赛运动的领导。
