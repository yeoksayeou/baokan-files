Xinhua News Agency, September 26th. American warmongers continue to spread intimidation about preparing to launch a nuclear war in the Taiwan area. According to a report from a United Press International reporter today from the American aircraft carrier "Midway," which is cruising off the coast of Taiwan, US Seventh Fleet Commander Bickley told American reporters on this warship that "the Seventh Fleet is currently maintaining maximum performance and is ready to fight a major war if necessary." When American reporters asked Bickley about reports that US aircraft carrier bombers in the Taiwan Strait were prepared to launch an immediate offensive, this American general yelled that his "fleet has a certain number of ships ready to deal with a major war at any time," and therefore, "some aircraft must be ready with special weapons at all times," and "they can be used quickly as soon as they receive an order."

Another report from United Press International from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia yesterday said that US Tactical Air Force Commander Weyland admitted that seven types of aircraft had been rushed from ten air force bases in the United States to Taiwan and other areas in the Far East in order to form a so-called "strike force" with the purpose of being able to "rapidly deploy in the event of a limited war or the dangers arising therefrom." The report said that these aircraft were transferred in two batches on August 30 and 31. These two batches of aircraft included F-100 jet fighters, F-Voodoo fighters, RF-101 photographic reconnaissance jets, B-57 tactical bombers, C-130 turboprop transport aircraft, and RV-50 tanker aircraft.

US imperialist warships and aircraft have recently continuously intruded into our country's territorial waters and airspace, and our government has issued thirteen serious warnings. The Chinese people are extremely indignant at the US government's disregard of our government's repeated warnings and its continued expansion of provocative activities.

    战争狂人妄想用战争吓人
    美国第七舰队司令叫嚣要发动大战
    新华社26日讯  美国战争贩子继续散播准备在台湾地区发动核战争的恫吓。据合众国际社记者今天从美国航空母舰“中途号”发出的消息，美国第七舰队司令比克利在这艘弋游在台湾沿海的军舰上对美国记者说，“第七舰队目前正保持着最高限度的性能，并且随时准备着在必要时打一场大战”。当美国记者提出了台湾海峡美国航空母舰的轰炸机有立即进行进攻的准备的消息，向比克利询问时，这个美国将军叫嚣说，他的“舰队中一定数量的舰只随时准备应付大战”，因此，必须使“部分飞机带着特种武器随时准备着”，“一接到命令很快就可以使用”。
    合众国际社昨天从美国弗吉尼亚洲兰莱空军基地发出的另一则消息说，美国战术空军司令威兰承认，已经从美国本土的十个空军基地赶调了七种飞机前往台湾和远东其它地区，以便组成一支所谓“打击力量”，目的是为了“一旦发生有限的战争或是由此所产生出来的危险时能够迅速进行部署”。消息说，这些飞机是8月30日和31日分两批调去的。这两批飞机包括F—一○○型喷气战斗机、F伏杜式战斗机RF—一○一摄影侦察喷气机、B—五七战术轰炸机、C—一三○涡轮推进运输机、RV—五○加油机。
    美帝国主义的军舰和飞机最近不断侵入我国领海和领空，我国政府已经提出了十三次严重警告。中国人民对美国政府忽视我国政府的迭次警告，继续扩大侵略范围的挑衅活动，感到极大愤慨。
