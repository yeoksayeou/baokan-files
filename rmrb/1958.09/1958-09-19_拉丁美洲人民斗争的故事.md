Stories of the Struggles of the Latin American People
By our reporters Xiao Guang and Cheng Guangrui

The East Wind is awakening Latin America. On the vast land of Latin America, the flames of the national independence struggle are beginning to spread across the entire continent, shining brightly alongside the flames of national independence struggles in Asia and Africa, illuminating more than half the world. Neither the outrageous interference of the United States nor the bloody suppression by dictatorial tyrants in certain Latin American countries can stop the development of the Latin American people's struggle for freedom and liberation. Recently, student representatives from Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba, and Peru, who came from this distant region to Beijing to attend the International Union of Students Congress, shared with us the stories of the Latin American people's struggles.

Starting with a Black Veil

Readers may remember a photo published in this newspaper in early August: the headquarters of the Brazilian National Student Union was draped in black, with a banner hanging in the middle that read: "Dulles, Go Home!" This was the Brazilian students' response to U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' visit to Brazil. Despite the Brazilian government's prior deployment of military police on the streets of Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian students and youth, disregarding the threat of machine guns and tear gas from the authorities, bravely held a passionate patriotic anti-American demonstration. The next day, as Dulles' motorcade passed the headquarters of the Brazilian National Student Union, hundreds of students waved their fists at him from the windows and roof of the building, shouting: "Dulles, go back!"

Remisso Sales, representative of the Brazilian National Student Union, Carlos Roy Trojo, representative of the Bahia Student Union of the University of Brazil, and Rudy Alfonso, vice president of the Brazilian National Student Union, recalled the events that had recently occurred with indescribable excitement. They said that Brazilian students opposed Dulles in this way because they hated the United States' policy towards Latin American countries; a policy that, as Dulles himself admitted, meant the United States did not want friends, only benefits! It had seriously hindered Brazil's economic development and harmed Brazil's independence and sovereignty.

Everyone knows that Brazil has abundant natural resources, but its economy is controlled by U.S. imperialist trusts, preventing development. In recent years, in order to get rid of its economic backwardness, Brazil has actively sought to establish and develop its own industries, primarily petroleum, automobiles, electricity, and steel. But how has the United States, which has always called itself a "good neighbor" to Latin American countries, treated Brazil? Just taking steel as an example, last summer, when the Brazilian government requested a $40 million loan from the United States to expand its steel industry, the U.S. National Steel Corporation believed that any expansion of Brazilian steel companies would adversely affect the U.S. steel industry and flatly refused. The manager of this U.S. company even arrogantly said: Almost every Latin American country wants to use American money to build steel mills. The United States should make it clear to them and let them use their own money to build steel mills. Brazil's policy of protecting coffee prices, which accounts for 70% of its foreign exchange earnings, has also been met with fierce opposition and sabotage from the United States.

According to the guests, Brazilian students and youth have a glorious tradition of democratic and patriotic struggle. They are always concerned about the fate of their country and actively participate in the movement to break free from U.S. control and strive for national independence. Currently, the Brazilian people's struggle for the nationalization of oil has been victorious. Despite U.S. sabotage, the Brazilian people will do everything possible to defend Petrobras, which symbolizes Brazilian sovereignty; and will actively strive for national protection and monopoly over the electricity industry, atomic raw materials, and transportation.

Brazilian students also stand with the people in firmly opposing nuclear weapons tests that endanger humanity and advocate peaceful coexistence among all countries. They conveyed the good wishes entrusted to them by Brazilian scientists. These scientists issued a statement in early August protesting the United States' testing of nuclear weapons and sinking their remnants to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, polluting the seawater and affecting the safety of countries and people in the surrounding area.

Jiménez Fails Again and Again

In many luxurious residences in Miami, a coastal city in Florida, live a large number of Latin American scoundrels nurtured by U.S. monopoly capitalists, including the dictator Jiménez, who was overthrown by the Venezuelan people in January of this year. This reactionary ringleader of Venezuela, relying on the support of U.S. weapons and money, twice plotted armed coups to subvert the Venezuelan military junta on July 22 and September 7, at the instigation of his American masters. However, these coups were crushed by the enormous popular power of the Venezuelan people.

How did the Venezuelan people traverse this path of struggle, from overthrowing the Jiménez dictatorship to crushing Jiménez's restoration? Ji Camon, chairman of the Central University Student Union of Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, told us about this.

Venezuela has always been a paradise coveted by U.S. monopoly capitalists, who extract huge profits every year from its abundant oil and iron ore and vast lands. To ensure the acquisition and continuous increase of these profits, U.S. monopoly capitalists chose Jiménez, a reactionary Venezuelan military officer and then Chief of Staff, as their agent ten years ago. On November 23, 1948, Jiménez seized power and implemented a dictatorship. For ten years, the Venezuelan people lived a life of blood and tears under Jiménez's tyranny. A large number of progressive figures in political and cultural circles were arrested and persecuted, more than 20,000 people were forced into exile, and progressive organizations such as trade unions and student unions were banned... However, Jiménez's tyranny not only failed to suppress the people's resistance, but also made the people more united and strengthened their fighting force, to the extent that they overthrew his dictatorial government and drove him from power on January 23 of this year.

"The struggle against the Jiménez dictatorship was prepared," said Camon. Before the events occurred, student organizations were forced to go underground, where they organized the National Student Front, uniting students across the country, conducting propaganda, mobilizing the people, and waiting for the opportunity. On November 21, 1957, the national student strike took place, which received sympathy and support from the people across the country, laying a good foundation for the overthrow of the Jiménez government. Subsequently, the United Front of various parties—the Patriotic Civic Committee—joined forces with the Student Front and held a large demonstration of 50,000 people. On January 21, 1958, the opportunity arrived. A national strike, a student strike, and a market strike began throughout the country, and people from all over the country responded. Two days later, Jiménez was finally overthrown, tucked his tail between his legs, and fled to the Dominican Republic, and later to the United States. After the establishment of the military junta committee headed by Larrazabal, some democratic measures were implemented, which were welcomed and supported by the people. But the United States and its lackey, Jiménez, were not reconciled and plotted day and night to restore the dictatorial regime in Venezuela. After the Venezuelan people defeated the July 22 restoration activities of Jiménez's followers, a large demonstration of 100,000 people was held in Caracas to maintain democracy and celebrate the victory against subversion.

Camon personally participated in this large demonstration. He said: "This shows that the Venezuelan people's awareness is gradually increasing. Currently, the Venezuelan people are continuing their struggle for democracy and against subversion."

The Greater the Pressure, the Stronger the Resistance

What Cuban student representative Ambelo talked about was the current situation in Cuba: on the one hand, the growth of the guerrilla forces and the soaring fighting spirit of the people, and on the other hand, the frenzied persecution and bloody massacres of the Batista dictatorship.

Cuba's dictator Batista is a loyal servant of U.S. imperialism. He received large quantities of weapons, napalm bombs, and jet aircraft from his American masters, and carried out cruel bombing of the areas controlled by the Cuban rebels. This was not only to deal with the rebels, but even more so to deal with the defenseless farmers, because Batista believed that these farmers were supplying the rebels with food and supporting the rebels. The Batista government's air force's brutal bombing has already been praised by its American masters, and the Batista government's air force chief, Tabernia Palmero, and others have "won" "special medals" issued by Eisenhower!

"But," said Ambelo, "the government army's 'sweeps' did not sweep away the guerrilla zones, nor did they eliminate the rebels. On the contrary, the guerrilla zones have expanded, and the rebels have become stronger. Currently, the rebel forces have grown from 5,000 to 8,000 people, and are fighting the government army in vast areas of four provinces."

U.S. imperialism has not only indirectly invaded Cuba, but also staged an ugly farce of attempting to directly invade Cuba not long ago. Under the pretext of "protecting" the water source for the U.S. military base at Guantanamo in Cuba, the U.S. invaders attempted to send Marines to land in Cuba in order to attack the rebels. Only because of the widespread opposition of the Cuban people and international public opinion did the U.S. invaders have to temporarily withdraw their bloody hand of intervention.

"The Cuban people hate the American interventionists!" said Ambelo.

This hatred has aroused the Cuban people's heroic struggle against the Batista dictatorship. Facing the increasingly strong popular forces, the Batista government was terrified, and therefore carried out a frenzied suppression of the people.

"Currently, the whole of Cuba has become a world of terror! Military police kill people arbitrarily without punishment," said Ambelo, giving an example: "Once, two students were visiting their teacher's home when Batista's police broke in and immediately opened fire and killed the two students on the spot without distinguishing right from wrong, on the pretext that the two students were from the rebels." She then went on to say: "Currently in Cuba, lawyers cannot defend political prisoners, and doctors cannot treat the rebels. Upright lawyers and doctors are forced to flee everywhere."

Ambelo said: "The Batista government's decision to hold a general election on November 3 of this year will not have good results. Most people will not participate. The Batista government has also estimated this situation. For example, they are using methods such as dismissal to intimidate workers into participating in the election." The greater the pressure, the stronger the resistance. Ambelo said that the Cuban people are stepping up their unity. For example, in March of this year, Cuban students formed a national front.

Thirty Years of Hatred

The famous University of San Marcos in Lima, the capital of Peru, was established in 1551, and it is the pride of Peruvian national culture. The students of the University of San Marcos, which has a fine democratic tradition, recently drove away the FBI agent Goldin and U.S. Vice President Nixon. As the Peruvian journalist C. Checa said well in a recent conversation with a reporter from the Chilean "Siglo" newspaper, "There is no place in this university for cultural merchants, imperialist agents, war instigators, and ignorant and ignorant propagandists hired by monopoly organizations."

The student representative of the University of San Marcos proudly told us about their chase after Nixon. He said that they could never allow Nixon to taint the honor of the University of San Marcos, and they could never accept the visit of this representative of the American government who oppresses the Peruvian people. Before Nixon arrived in Lima, the students of San Marcos University, together with various parties and youth organizations, held a meeting and decided to expel Nixon. After Nixon arrived in Lima, they first held a large-scale anti-American demonstration in San Martin Square. Afterwards, as everyone knows, when Nixon "visited" the University of San Marcos, they "welcomed" the American Vice President with stones and saliva, beating and scolding him until he fled with his head in his hands.

The Peruvian people's hatred of U.S. imperialism is not accidental. Like the people of other Latin American countries, they have suffered the long-term exploitation of U.S. monopoly capitalists. "The United States has exploited the Peruvian people for thirty years!" The Peruvian student representative told us: "The Americans, those hypocrites, always say that they are Peru's 'good neighbors,' but in reality, they are Peru's overlords! We sell things to the United States, and the Americans say how much money to give, and that's how much. The 'Marshall Plan' only gave the Peruvian people a few crumbs!"

Because of this, the Peruvian people's most urgent desire is to break free from U.S. control and exploitation and embark on the path of national independence and development. The Peruvian student representative said: "This is not only the desire of the Peruvian people, but the common desire of the people of twenty Latin American countries."... The conversations with the young Latin American friends ended here. Their conversations gave us a clear impression: Under the general world situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the national independence movements in Latin American countries are beginning a new stage of vigorous development.

    拉丁美洲人民斗争的故事
    本报记者　萧光　程光锐
    东风吹醒了拉丁美洲。在拉丁美洲广阔的土地上，民族独立斗争的火焰正开始在整个大地上延烧，它同亚洲和非洲的民族独立斗争的火光相互辉映，照亮了大半个世界。美国的横暴干涉和某些拉丁美洲国家独裁暴君的血腥镇压都不能阻止拉丁美洲人民争自由求解放斗争的发展。最近，从这个遥远的地区前来北京参加国际学联代表大会的巴西、委内瑞拉、古巴和秘鲁的学生代表，向我们介绍了拉丁美洲人民斗争的故事。
    从黑纱谈起
    读者也许还记得8月初本报上登的一幅照片：巴西全国学生联合会总部的大楼披上了黑纱，大楼中间悬挂着横幅标语：“杜勒斯回家去！”这就是巴西学生对于美国国务卿杜勒斯到巴西进行访问的回答。尽管巴西政府事先在里约热内卢各条街道布置了军警戒严，巴西学生和青年仍然不顾当局的机关枪和催泪弹的威胁，英勇地举行了情绪激昂的爱国反美大示威。第二天，当杜勒斯的车队开过巴西全国学生联合会总部大楼的时候，几百名学生从大楼的窗口和屋顶上向他挥舞拳头，高喊：“杜勒斯，滚回去！”
    巴西全国学生联合会代表雷米索·萨来斯、巴西大学学生联合会巴雅代表恰洛斯·罗易·脱罗霍和巴西全国学生联合会副主席鲁地·阿方索回想起不久以前发生的事件，还有说不出的兴奋。他们说，巴西学生所以这样反对杜勒斯，是因为他们痛恨美国对拉丁美洲国家的政策；这种政策正像杜勒斯自己承认的那样——美国不要朋友，只要利益！它已经严重地妨害了巴西经济的发展，损害着巴西的独立和主权。
    谁都知道巴西拥有丰富的自然资源，但是它的经济却控制在美帝国主义托辣斯的手里，不得发展。近年来，巴西为了摆脱经济上的落后状态，积极要求建立和发展本国的工业，首先是石油、汽车、电力和钢铁等工业。但是一向自称是拉丁美洲国家的“好邻居”的美国，是以怎样的态度对待巴西的呢？只举钢铁的例子来说，去年夏天，当巴西政府要求美国借款四千万美元来扩大钢铁工业的时候，美国国家钢铁公司认为任何巴西钢铁公司的扩大都会反过来影响美国钢铁工业，于是断然加以拒绝。这家美国公司的经理甚至傲慢地说：差不多每一个拉丁美洲国家都想用美国的钱来建立炼钢厂，美国应该明白告诉他们，让他们用自己的钱去建立炼钢厂吧。而巴西为了保护占它外汇收入70％的咖啡价格的政策，也遭到美国的疯狂反对和破坏。
    根据客人们的介绍，巴西学生和青年具有民主和爱国斗争的光荣传统。他们时刻关心祖国的命运，积极参加摆脱美国控制、争取民族独立的运动。目前，巴西人民争取石油国有化的斗争，已经取得了胜利。尽管美国阴谋破坏，巴西人民将尽一切力量保卫象征巴西主权的巴西石油公司；并且将积极争取国家对于电力工业、原子原料和交通运输的保护和垄断。
    巴西学生也和人民一起坚决反对危害人类的核武器试验，主张世界各国和平相处。他们转达了巴西科学家托付的良好愿望。这些科学家在8月初曾经发表声明抗议美国试验核武器，将它的残骸沉入大西洋底，弄脏了海水，影响周围地区国家和人民的安全。
    希门尼斯失败再失败
    在美国佛罗里达州海滨城市迈阿密的许多豪华的住宅里，住着美国垄断资本家豢养的大批的拉丁美洲的败类，其中包括今年1月被委内瑞拉人民赶下台的独裁者希门尼斯。这个委内瑞拉的反动头子，倚仗着美国的武器和金元的支持，曾经在今年7月22日和9月7日两次在他的美国主子唆使下策动了颠复委内瑞拉军政府委员会的武装政变。可是，这些政变都被委内瑞拉巨大的人民力量粉碎了。
    从推翻希门尼斯独裁政府到粉碎希门尼斯的复辟，委内瑞拉人民是怎样走过这条斗争的道路的？委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯中央大学生联合会主席季·卡蒙向我们谈了这方面的情况。
    委内瑞拉一向是美国垄断资本家所迷恋的乐园，他们每年从那里的丰富的石油与铁矿和广阔的土地上榨取着高额的利润。为了保证这种利润的取得和不断增加，美国垄断资本家在十年前选择了委内瑞拉的反动军官、当时的参谋总长希门尼斯充当他们的代理人。1948年11月23日，希门尼斯攫取了政权，并且实行了独裁。十年来，委内瑞拉人民在希门尼斯的暴政下过着血泪交流的日子。大批政界和文化界的进步人士被逮捕和迫害，两万多人被迫流亡国外，工会和学生会等进步组织被禁止活动……。然而，希门尼斯的暴政不仅没有镇压住人民的反抗，而且使得人民更加团结，人民的斗争力量更加壮大，以至于在今年1月23日推翻了他的独裁政府，把他赶下了台。
    “反对希门尼斯独裁政府的斗争是有准备的。”卡蒙说，事件发生以前，学生组织被迫转入地下，他们在地下组织了全国学生阵线，团结全国学生，进行宣传，动员人民，等待时机。1957年11月21日，全国学生总罢课，这次罢课得到了全国人民的同情和支持，给推翻希门尼斯政府打下了很好的基础。接着，各党派组织的联合阵线——公民爱国委员会同学生阵线联合起来，举行了五万人的大示威。1958年1月21日，时机到来了，全国开始罢工、罢课、罢市，全国各地人民纷纷响应。两天以后，希门尼斯终于被赶下了台，夹着尾巴逃到多米尼加，后来又到美国去。以拉腊萨巴耳为首的军政府委员会成立以后，实行了一些民主措施，受到了人民的欢迎和支持。但是美国和它的走狗希门尼斯并不甘心，日夜策划着独裁政权在委内瑞拉复辟。委内瑞拉人民在打垮了7月22日希门尼斯分子的复辟活动以后，加拉加斯曾经举行了十万人的维护民主、庆祝反颠复胜利的大示威。
    卡蒙亲身参加了这次大示威。他说：“这表明委内瑞拉人民的觉悟逐渐提高了。目前，委内瑞拉人民正在为争民主反颠复继续斗争。”
    压力越大，反抗越强
    古巴学生代表安贝罗所谈的今日古巴的情况是：一面是游击队力量的壮大和人民斗志的昂扬，一面是巴蒂斯塔独裁政府的疯狂迫害和血腥屠杀。
    古巴的独裁者巴蒂斯塔是美帝国主义的忠实奴仆。他从他的美国主子那里得到了大批武器、凝固汽油弹和喷气式飞机，向古巴起义军所控制的地区进行残酷的轰炸。这不仅是对付起义军，而且更是要对付手无寸铁的农民。因为巴蒂斯塔认为就是这些农民供给起义军粮食，支援起义军。巴蒂斯塔政府空军的残酷轰炸，已经受到了它的美国主子的表扬，巴蒂斯塔政府空军头子塔伯尔尼亚·帕尔梅罗等“荣获”艾森豪威尔发给的“特别勋章”！
    “可是”，安贝罗说：“政府军的‘扫荡’并没有荡平了游击区，更没能消灭起义军。恰恰相反，游击区更扩大了，起义军也更加壮大了。目前，起义军已经由过去的五千人发展到八千人，而且是在四个省的广大地区同政府军作战了。”
    美帝国主义不仅对古巴进行了间接侵略，而且在不久前还表演了一次企图直接侵略古巴的丑剧。美国侵略者借口“保护”古巴的关塔那摩美军基地的军用水源，企图派遣海军陆战队在古巴登陆，以便进攻起义军。只是古巴人民和各国舆论的普遍反对，美国侵略者才不得不暂时缩回了干涉的血手。
    “古巴人民恨透了美国干涉者！”安贝罗说。
    这种仇恨激起了古巴人民反对巴蒂斯塔独裁政府的英勇斗争。面对着越来越壮大的人民力量，巴蒂斯塔政府恐惧万分，因此，对人民进行了疯狂的镇压。
    “目前古巴全国已成恐怖世界！军警任意杀人而不受惩罚。”安贝罗举例说：“有一次，两个学生正在他的老师家中作客，巴蒂斯塔的警察闯进去，不分青红皂白，就立即开枪把这两位学生当场打死，借口说这两位学生是从起义军那里来的。”她又接着说：“目前在古巴，律师不能为政治犯辩护，医生不能为起义军治病。正直的律师和医生们被迫四处流亡。”
    安贝罗说：“巴蒂斯塔政府规定在今年11月3日举行大选不会有好结果的。大部分人不会参加。巴蒂斯塔政府也估计到了这种情况，例如，他们正在用解雇等方法恐吓工人要他们参加选举。”压力越大，反抗越强。安贝罗说，古巴人民正在加紧团结起来，例如今年3月，古巴学生组成了全国阵线。
    三十年的仇恨
    秘鲁首都利马著名的学府圣马科斯大学建立于1551年，它是秘鲁民族文化的骄傲。具有优良的民主传统的圣马科斯大学的学生们，不久前赶走了美国联邦调查局的特务戈尔金和美国副总统尼克松。秘鲁新闻工作者卡·切卡不久前在对智利“世纪报”记者的谈话中说得好，他说：“在这座大学中再没有文化商人、帝国主义代理人、战争挑拨者和垄断组织雇佣的无知无识和愚昧的宣传家立脚的地方。”
    圣马科斯大学学生代表十分自豪地同我们谈起他们追打尼克松的情形。他说，他们决不能让尼克松沾污了圣马科斯大学的荣誉，他们决不能接受这位压迫秘鲁人民的美国政府代表人物的访问。在尼克松到达利马以前，圣马科斯的大学生和各党派与各青年组织一起开了会，决定要驱逐尼克松。在尼克松到达利马后，他们首先在圣马丁广场举行了大规模的反美示威。以后就是大家共知的，当尼克松“访问”圣马科斯大学时，他们就用石头和唾沫“欢迎”了这个美国的副总统，一直打骂得他抱头鼠窜。
    秘鲁人民对美帝国主义的仇恨不是偶然的。他们同拉丁美洲各国人民一样，受尽了美国垄断资本家的长期剥削。“美国剥削秘鲁人民已达三十年了！”秘鲁学生代表对我们说：“美国人伪善者口口声声说他们是秘鲁的‘好邻居’，实际上他们是秘鲁的太上皇！我们卖给美国的东西，美国人说给多少钱就是多少钱。‘马歇尔计划’给予秘鲁人民的只是几片面包屑而已！”
    正因为这样，秘鲁人民最迫切的愿望是摆脱美国的控制和剥削，走上民族独立和发展的道路。秘鲁学生代表说：“这不只是秘鲁一国人民的愿望，而是二十个拉丁美洲国家人民的共同愿望。” ……拉丁美洲青年朋友们的谈话就此结束了。他们的谈话给我们一个鲜明的印象：在东风压倒西风的总的世界形势下，拉丁美洲各国的民族独立运动正在开始一个蓬勃发展的新阶段。
