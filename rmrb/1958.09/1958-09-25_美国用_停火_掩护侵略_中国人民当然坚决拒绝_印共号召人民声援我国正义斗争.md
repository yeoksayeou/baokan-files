Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 23rd - The Secretariat of the National Council of the Communist Party of India issued a statement tonight condemning the United States' aggressive actions on the Chinese coast.

	The statement said that it is only natural that the Chinese people and government refuse to tolerate this intolerable situation. Instead of withdrawing from these islands, the American aggressors have put forward the absurd "ceasefire" claim, attempting to maintain the status quo so that they can continue to use these islands as their bridgehead. The statement said, "They threaten to use nuclear weapons to bomb China if the Chinese government does not yield to American conditions." The statement pointed out that this crazy action must be stopped.

	The statement said, "The self-respecting Chinese people have rightly rejected the absurd demands of the United States, and they are widely mobilizing the masses nationwide to defend their motherland."

	The statement said: Dulles and Eisenhower, after suffering a crushing defeat in the Arab world, "are pushing the world to the brink of world war with dying madness." The statement pointed out that peace-loving people around the world are increasingly supporting China's just cause, while the American warmongers are becoming increasingly isolated.

	The Secretariat of the National Council of the Communist Party of India called on the Indian people to hold a "National United Demonstration on Chinese National Day to express India's love and friendship for the Chinese people, as well as hatred and contempt for the American aggressors."

	The statement said that on this day, "The Communist Party of India will unite with all patriotic organizations and friends of China to express India's solidarity with the People's China."

    美国用“停火”掩护侵略
    中国人民当然坚决拒绝
    印共号召人民声援我国正义斗争
    新华社新德里23日电  印度共产党全国委员会书记处今晚发表声明，谴责美国在中国沿海的侵略行动。
    声明说，中国人民和政府拒绝容忍这种不能容忍的局势是理所当然的。美国侵略者不仅没有撤出这些岛屿，反而提出荒谬的“停火”说法，企图维持现状，以便他们能够继续利用这些岛屿作为他们的桥头堡。声明说，“他们威胁说，如果中国政府不向美国的条件屈服，他们就要用核武器轰击中国”。声明指出，必须制止这种疯狂行动。
    声明说，“富有自尊心的中国人民理所当然地拒绝了美国的荒谬要求，他们正在全国范围广泛动员群众来保卫他们的祖国。”
    声明说：杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔在阿拉伯世界遭到惨败以后，“又以垂死的疯狂把世界推到世界大战的边缘”。声明指出，全世界爱好和平的人民越来越支持中国的正义事业，而美国战争狂人则越来越陷于孤立。
    印度共产党全国委员会书记处号召印度人民在中国国庆日举行“全国联合大示威，表示印度对中国人民的热爱和友谊，以及对美国侵略者的憎恨和蔑视”。
    声明说，在这一天，“印度共产党将同一切爱国组织和中国的朋友们联合在一起，来表示印度对人民中国的声援。”
