Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: The National Quyi Work Conference held in Beijing in August discussed issues such as building new socialist Quyi and expanding and improving the Quyi ranks. In order to enable Quyi to better serve socialist construction and workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to adapt to the situation of Quyi's development to a new stage, the conference proposed to further strengthen the Party's leadership over Quyi work, implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," mobilize all positive forces, vigorously carry out mass amateur and professional Quyi activities, and implement the great popularization of new socialist Quyi.

    The conference pointed out that the Quyi ranks should also be rectified and expanded. According to the characteristics of Quyi performers being suitable for dispersed activities, the vast number of performers should be organized through flexible and diverse organizational forms to promote and help them go up to the mountains, down to the countryside, and down to factories to transform their thinking and rapidly improve their political, cultural, and professional levels. At the same time, vigorously develop new Quyi that reflects socialist reality and the revolutionary struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and more systematically and comprehensively explore and sort out excellent traditional programs so that the past can serve the present.

    The conference put forward specific goals for the realization of the above-mentioned principles and tasks to Quyi workers across the country. That is: strive to ensure that within two years, most agricultural cooperatives and cultural and art organizations in factories, mines, schools, and government agencies in Quyi popular areas have their own amateur Quyi propagandists; according to the specific circumstances of different Quyi genres, troupes, and performers, strive to make the proportion of modern programs in the entire repertoire reach 40% to 70% respectively within two years, and make a large number of modern programs highly ideological, artistic, and expressive, and become excellent retained programs; strive to basically complete the excavation of excellent traditional programs within three years, and select key programs for sorting and performance. The conference called on Quyi workers to go deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers, participate in physical labor, strive to transform and improve themselves, and strive to become all-rounders who are both red and expert in the short term, and become new socialist people who combine mental and physical labor.

    The conference summarized the achievements and experiences of Quyi work in the past nine years, pointing out that Quyi has developed to a new stage, and new socialist Quyi is growing. The conference believes that the experience of the past nine years shows that the new socialist Quyi and the Quyi ranks have grown and developed in the struggle between two roads. The Party's leadership and the improvement of the political and ideological awareness of Quyi performers are the guarantee for the rapid development of new socialist Quyi; at the same time, it must be pointed out that the struggle between the two roads in the Quyi circle has not ended. In order to prosper and develop new socialist Quyi, it is necessary to continue to pull out the white flags and plant the red flags, and resolutely struggle against the bourgeois roads of so-called "art for art's sake," "art for money's sake," and "Quyi for Quyi's sake." Other experiences in the past nine years are: the development of Quyi undertakings must implement the mass line; Quyi performers must be organized; the relationship between politics and art must be properly handled so that Quyi closely cooperates with production and political propaganda; and we must "walk on two legs." Experience has also proved that the cooperation between new literary and art workers and Quyi workers and performers is of great significance. The conference hopes that new literary and art workers will actively participate in Quyi work, and better unite and cooperate with Quyi performers and learn from each other.

    Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, spoke on the last day of the conference. He hoped that the cultural departments in various places would, under the leadership of the Party committees, further attach importance to and carry out Quyi work, and give full play to its vanguard role.

    社会主义新曲艺的大普及
    全国曲艺工作会议大力开展曲艺活动
    据新华社15日讯　8月间在北京召开的全国曲艺工作会议讨论了建设社会主义新曲艺和扩大、提高曲艺队伍等问题。为了使曲艺更好地为社会主义建设和工农兵服务，并适应曲艺发展到新阶段的形势，这次会议提出要进一步加强党对曲艺工作的领导，贯彻“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，调动一切积极力量，大力开展群众业余的和职业的曲艺活动，实行社会主义新曲艺的大普及。
    会议指出，还应整顿和扩大曲艺队伍，根据曲艺艺人适宜分散活动的特点，通过灵活多样的组织形式，将广大艺人组织起来，推动和帮助他们上山下乡下工厂，改造思想，迅速提高政治、文化、业务水平；并且大力发展反映社会主义现实内容与工农兵革命斗争史实的新曲艺，同时更有计划地全面地发掘整理优秀的传统曲目，使古为今用。
    会议向全国曲艺工作者提出了实现上述方针任务的具体奋斗目标。这就是：争取在两年内，在曲艺流行地区的大多数农业社和工矿、学校、机关的文艺组织内部都能有自己的业余曲艺宣传员；根据不同曲种、班挡和艺人的具体情况，争取在两年内使现代曲目在整个上演曲目中所占的比例分别达到40％到70％，并使大量现代曲目具有高度的思想性、艺术性和表现技巧，成为优秀的保留曲目；争取在三年内基本上将优秀传统曲目发掘完毕，并选择重点曲目整理上演。会议号召曲艺工作者深入工农兵，参加体力劳动，努力改造和提高自己，争取在短期内成为又红又专的多面手，成为脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的社会主义新人。
    这次会议总结了九年来曲艺工作的成绩和经验，指出曲艺已经发展到一个新的阶段，社会主义新曲艺正在成长。会议认为，过去九年的经验表明，社会主义的新曲艺和曲艺队伍都是在两条道路的斗争中成长壮大起来的。党的领导和曲艺艺人政治思想觉悟的提高是社会主义新曲艺迅速发展的保证；同时必须指出，曲艺界两条道路的斗争并没有完结，为了繁荣和发展社会主义新曲艺，就必须继续拔白旗，插红旗，同资产阶级的所谓“为艺术而艺术”、“为金钱而艺术”、“为曲艺而曲艺”的道路进行坚决的斗争。过去九年的另一些经验是：发展曲艺事业必须贯彻群众路线；必须把曲艺艺人组织起来；必须摆对政治与艺术的关系，使曲艺密切地配合生产和政治宣传；必须“两条腿走路”。经验还证明，新文艺工作者同曲艺工作者和艺人的合作，有着重要的意义，会议希望新文艺工作者积极参加曲艺工作，同曲艺艺人们更好地团结合作，互相学习。
    文化部副部长刘芝明在会议最后一天讲了话，他希望各地文化部门要在党委领导下，更进一步重视和开展曲艺工作，充分发挥它的尖兵作用。
