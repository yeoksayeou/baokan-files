Xinhua News Agency, September 20th. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles spoke on September 18th during the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly, initially addressing the situation in the Taiwan Strait. In his speech, he repeated the robber logic previously employed by Eisenhower and himself regarding the Taiwan Strait situation, falsely accusing the Chinese people of liberating their own territory as "attempting to expand power" through "naked force" and so-called "armed aggression." Dulles engaged in a shameless prevarication for the U.S.'s occupation of Chinese territory through the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He avoided discussing the immediate cessation of the U.S. aggressive troops' dangerous playing with fire in the Taiwan Strait, instead demanding the realization of a so-called "ceasefire." He also proposed utilizing the United Nations as a tool for U.S. interference in the internal affairs of the Chinese people. The full text of Dulles's speech concerning the Taiwan Strait situation is as follows:

    "Let me first turn to the situation in the Taiwan (Formosa) Strait area.

    On August 23, the Chinese Communists suddenly began heavy shelling of the Quemoy Islands. The artillery was mainly supplied by the Soviet Union. In the weeks that followed, hundreds of thousands of shells rained down on these islands, causing death and destruction. This shelling was accompanied by naval attempts to blockade the islands, and calls for the island's garrison to surrender or be annihilated.

    I am aware that there are many complex factors in this situation. But there are two indisputable and decisive facts, which are:

    First, the Chinese Communist regime has never exercised authority over Taiwan, the Pescadores, or the coastal islands in its nine years of existence.

    Second, the Chinese Communist regime is now attempting to extend its power to these areas by naked force.

    Therefore, the issue is simple: it is conquest by force.

    In 1950, the United Nations dealt decisively with that issue. It determined by an overwhelming vote that the attack by North Korea to 'unify' Korea was armed aggression. It condemned the Chinese Communist regime as an aggressor because it participated in that armed attack.

    I am not unmindful of the argument that today's Chinese Communist offensive is an act of civil war. Mr. Vyshinsky made a similar argument in 1950. He then told us that the Korean War was purely a 'civil war' and that the outside interveners were the 'aggressors.' The United Nations rejected that argument by an overwhelming majority.

    Nor am I unmindful of the fact that the coastal islands are geographically close to mainland China. But we cannot agree with the view that countries have the right to seize territory by force merely because that territory is next door to them.

    The fact is that when a regime attempts by force to take territory that has long been under the jurisdiction of another government (and that is recognized by a large part of the world), that is an act of the use of force that endangers world order.

    The United States believes that the Chinese Communist armed aggression poses a serious threat and has ominous implications. Without a doubt, it again shows that the Chinese Communist regime is not 'peace-loving'—to use the words of our Charter.

    We hope to find a peaceful solution. The U.S. and Chinese Communist ambassadors are holding talks in Warsaw. We hope to achieve a ceasefire soon and obtain fair conditions to eliminate provocative actions and enable the various claims and counterclaims involved to be resolved peacefully.

    If it appears that bilateral talks between the ambassadors will not succeed, the United States reserves the right to bring this matter to the United Nations."

### 杜勒斯进行无耻狡辩  在联合国大会上就台湾海峡局势发言  不谈美国停止玩火倒叫嚣所谓“停火”

    杜勒斯进行无耻狡辩
    在联合国大会上就台湾海峡局势发言
    不谈美国停止玩火倒叫嚣所谓“停火”
    新华社20日讯　美国国务卿杜勒斯9月18日在联合国大会一般辩论中发言时首先谈到台湾海峡地区的局势，他在发言中重复了艾森豪威尔和他自己前此就台湾海峡局势玩弄的强盗逻辑，诬蔑中国人民解放自己的领土是“企图使用赤裸裸的武力”来“扩大权力”，是所谓“武装侵略”。杜勒斯为美国利用蒋介石集团侵占中国的领土进行了无耻的狡辩。他避而不谈立即停止美国侵略军在台湾海峡地区的危险的玩火行动，反而要求实现所谓“停火”。他并提出准备利用联合国来充当美国干涉中国人民的内政的工具。杜勒斯演说关于台湾海峡局势的部分全文如下：
    “让我首先谈台湾（福摩萨）海峡地区的局势。
    8月23日，中国共产党人突然猛烈炮轰金门岛群。大炮主要是苏联供应的。在这以后的几周中，数以计十万的炮弹雨般地射到这些岛上，造成死亡和破坏。在进行这种炮轰的同时，海军还企图封锁这些岛屿，此外还号召岛上守军投降，不然就要被消灭。
    我知道，在这个局势中有许多复杂的因素。但是有两个无可争辩的和具有决定意义的事实，这些事实是：
    一、中国共产党政权在它存在的九年中从来没有对台湾、澎湖或沿海岛屿行使权力。
    二、中国共产党政权现在企图使用赤裸裸的武力把它的权力扩大到这些地区。
    因此，这个问题很简单：是武力征服。
    在1950年，联合国断然处理了那个问题。它以压倒多数的票数断定，北朝鲜为‘统一’朝鲜而进行的攻击是武装侵略。它谴责中国共产党政权是侵略者，因为它参加了那次武装进攻。
    我并不漠视认为今天中国共产党的进攻是一个内战行动的论点。维辛斯基先生在1950年提出了相似的论点。他当时对我们说，朝鲜的战争纯粹是‘内战’，进行干涉的外来者是‘侵略者’。联合国以压倒多数拒绝了那种论点。
    我也不漠视沿海岛屿在地理上靠近大陆中国这一事实。但是我们不能同意一种意见，就是认为各国有权利以武力夺取领土，仅仅因为这个领土就在它的旁边。
    事实是，当一个政权企图用武力夺取长期在另一个政府管辖下（并且世界很大一部分国家承认这样一点）的另外的领土的时候，这就是危及世界秩序的使用武力的行动。
    美国认为，中国共产党的武装侵略造成了严重的威胁，并具有不祥的含义。毫无疑问，它再次表明中国共产党政权不是“爱好和平的”——用我们宪章的话来说。
    我们希望能够找到和平解决办法。美国和中国共产党的大使正在华沙举行会谈。我们希望很快实现停火和得到公平的条件以消除挑衅行动，并使所牵涉的各种要求和反要求得到和平解决。
    如果看来大使间的双边会谈不会成功的话，美国保留把这个问题提交联合国的权利。”
