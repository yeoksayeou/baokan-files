Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th. The Soviet people are expressing exceptional indignation at the unreasonable provocations of the United States against the People's Republic of China. Workers, farmers and intellectual laborers are all demanding that a stop be put to the aggressive actions of the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek clique that threaten world peace.

　　Many factories and construction sites in Kiev held discussions on the 6th and read newspaper materials related to the Far East situation. Ostrogorsky, a fitter at the Lenin Arsenal, said that the occupation of the Taiwan area and the Penghu Islands by the American armed forces is proof of the illegal violation of the People's Republic of China's territorial integrity and sovereignty. We Ukrainian workers wholeheartedly love and respect our Chinese brothers and fully support their just demand to recover their own territory.

　　Odinokova, a technician at the Leningrad Electric Power Plant, said in a letter to her Chinese friends that the Soviet and Chinese nations are close brothers. The Soviet people are closely watching the hostile actions of American imperialism in the Far East. We will always be with the Chinese people.

　　Soviet expert Dolgashin, who has just returned from China, said that we are angered by the shameless behavior of the American imperialists. "Americans get out of China" is our unanimous demand.

　　Tajik collective farmer Zhuraev wrote in "Labor News": The Soviet people are ready at any time to help their Chinese friends and brothers with all means when they have difficulties.

　　Soviet soldier Druzhinin published an article in "Labor News" saying that we will stand with our Chinese brothers and defend to the end the right to peaceful labor and a happy life for the people of our two countries. We have sufficient manpower and material resources to do this.
