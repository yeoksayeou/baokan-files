Commentary on Letters from Readers

    Newspaper Distribution Still Needs Improvement
    Since the Great Leap Forward, there have been great improvements in newspaper distribution. Post offices in various places have abolished many outdated regulations and established some subscription and fee collection methods that are convenient for readers. However, recently, this newspaper has still received many letters from readers reflecting that they cannot subscribe to newspapers and magazines, or that they do not receive them after subscribing. In the eighteen days from August 12 to August 29 alone, we received thirty-four letters of this kind. Kuang Dinggui from Pingtang County, Guizhou Province, subscribed to the People's Daily in July, but had not seen it by the beginning of August. Wang Yongping from the No. 845 Farm in Hulin County, Heilongjiang Province, wrote to say that they cannot see newspapers at all, although there is a postal worker in the farm, he refuses to accept subscriptions to newspapers and magazines.
    Judging from the situations reflected in these letters, newspaper distribution work still needs to be improved. It is necessary not only to make subscription procedures convenient for readers, but also to improve internal work and eliminate delays, errors, and other phenomena. Newspapers and magazines are one of the main tools for our Party and country to carry out political propaganda and mobilization work, and are the "spiritual food" for the broad masses of people to study current affairs, policies, theories, and exchange experiences. Newspaper distribution personnel should recognize the important significance of their work and do a good job in newspaper distribution in every possible way.

### 报刊发行还需继续改进

    报刊发行还需继续改进
    大跃进以来，报刊发行工作有很大的改进，各地邮局都废除了许多陋规，订立了一些便利读者的订阅和收费办法。但是，最近一个时期，本报仍然接到了不少读者来信，反映订不到报纸和杂志，或者订了收不到。仅8月12日到8月29日的十八天内，收到这类来信就有三十四件。贵州平塘县匡定贵订了7月份的人民日报，到8月初旬还没有看到。黑龙江省虎林县八四五农场王永平来信说，他们根本看不到报纸，虽然场里有一个邮务员，但是拒绝收订报刊。
    从这些来信反映的情况看，报刊发行工作还需要继续改进。不仅要在收订手续方面便利读者，而且要改进内部工作，消灭延误、差错等现象。报纸、杂志是我们党和国家进行政治宣传鼓动工作的主要工具之一，是广大人民群众学习时事、政策、理论和交流经验的“精神食粮”。报刊发行人员应该认识到自己工作的重要意义，千方百计做好报刊发行工作。
