Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, received a cable today from Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, expressing support for the Chinese people's struggle against U.S. military provocations in the Taiwan Strait.

The cable stated that the provocative interference by U.S. armed forces in the territorial waters of the People's Republic of China is dangerously aggravating the situation in the Taiwan Strait and threatening world peace. It has aroused angry protests from working people all over the world. In this situation, the World Federation of Trade Unions expresses the deep feelings of the working people and assures the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Chinese people of its fraternal support.

The cable also stated that the U.S. imperialists' blatant interference in the internal affairs of the great Chinese people once again proves the hypocrisy of its proclaimed right to self-determination for all peoples. In fact, this is yet another violation of the United Nations Charter. The WFTU strongly condemns the U.S. government's provocative policy of using force, which, after being demonstrated in the Middle East in recent months, is again threatening world peace in the Taiwan Strait. The WFTU is convinced that the People's Republic of China will defeat all provocative actions and exercise its sovereignty over Jinmen, Mazu, and the Taiwan Islands, which are an inseparable part of its territory. The active support of all peaceful forces worldwide is a valuable assistance to the entire Chinese people. It supports the Chinese people's struggle to exercise national sovereignty. United, we can defend world peace under threat and repel the imperialists.

(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency reports: The Rangoon Chinese newspaper "New Rangoon Daily" published an interview on September 10th with Thakin Khin Soe, General Secretary of the Burma Trade Union Congress, in which he expressed the Burmese workers' fervent sympathy for the Chinese people. He said that the Burma Trade Union Congress is preparing to convene local representative meetings in Rangoon and Yungsheng County to call on workers to take practical actions to protest the provocative actions of U.S. imperialists and to support the just struggle of the Chinese people and workers.

The Central Council of the Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions, with approximately 50,000 members, passed a resolution condemning the United States for interfering in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China by armed occupation of Chinese coastal islands. The Central Council demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Chinese islands, the return of these islands to the People's Republic of China, and the restoration of peace in the region. The resolution emphasized that the continued U.S. armed occupation of these islands poses a serious danger to world peace.

The trade union of Aleppo, the largest industrial and commercial city in the Syrian region, telegraphed the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, supporting the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands occupied by the United States. The telegram condemned U.S. interference in the Far East. The telegram pointed out that the United States is now doing in the Far East what it did not long ago to the Arab countries.

The telegram stated that Arab workers still remember the great role and tremendous contribution that the Chinese people played when the Arab people were in crisis.
