Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 9th: According to the Korean Central News Agency from Kaesong: The Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting today at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side.

    The Korean-Chinese side suggested that the U.S. side agree to allow representatives of mass organizations from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to travel to Seoul through the Demilitarized Zone and the Military Demarcation Line in order to discuss with the South Korean side the issue of providing relief to unemployed workers and wandering orphans in South Korea.

    Chief Commissioner Kang Sang-ho of the Korean-Chinese side said at the meeting that the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea and the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League had decided to send Vice Chairman Li In-dong of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions and Vice Chairman Kim Young-soo of the Central Committee of the Democratic Women's League to Seoul to discuss the issue of providing relief to unemployed workers and wandering orphans in South Korea with representatives from relevant parties in South Korea. Therefore, it was suggested that the U.S. side agree to allow them to enter the U.S. military-controlled area through the Demilitarized Zone and the Military Demarcation Line, guarantee their freedom of movement and personal safety within the U.S. military-controlled area, and provide them with necessary assistance.

    However, the U.S. side at the meeting still used various unfounded excuses to reject the suggestions of the Korean-Chinese side.

    Kang Sang-ho refuted the U.S. side at the meeting, saying that the Military Armistice Commission had taken similar necessary measures in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement after the armistice. He also cited a series of precedents. Kang Sang-ho demanded that the U.S. side seriously consider the suggestions of the Korean-Chinese side.

    Major General Ren Rong, representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers of the Korean-Chinese side, attended today's meeting.

    朝鲜群众团体派代表到汉城商谈救济事宜
    朝中方面要美方保证安全
    新华社平壤9日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：朝鲜军事停战委员会今天在朝中方面的建议下举行会议。
    朝中方面建议美方同意朝鲜民主主义人民共和国群众团体的代表通过非军事区和军事分界线前往汉城，以便同南朝鲜方面商谈救济南朝鲜失业工人和流浪孤儿的问题。
    朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将在会上说，朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会和朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会决定派遣职业总同盟中央委员会副委员长李仁同和民主妇女同盟中央委员会副委员长金英秀前往汉城，同南朝鲜有关方面的代表就救济南朝鲜失业工人和流浪孤儿问题进行商谈。因此建议美方同意他们通过非军事区和军事分界线进入美方军事控制地区，保证他们在美方军事控制地区内的活动自由和人身安全，并且给予他们必要的协助。
    但是，美方在会上依然用种种没有根据的借口，拒绝了朝中方面的建议。
    姜尚昊在会上驳斥美方说，军事停战委员会在停战以后曾经根据停战协定的有关规定采取过类似的必要措施。他并且举出了一系列的先例。姜尚昊要求美方郑重考虑朝中方面的建议。
    朝中方面中国人民志愿军代表任荣少将参加了今天的会议。
