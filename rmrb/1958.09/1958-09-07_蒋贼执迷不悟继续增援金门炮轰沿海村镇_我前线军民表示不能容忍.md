Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 6th: The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in Taiwan has continued to reinforce Kinmen in recent days and has continued to bombard our coastal villages.

In order to give the Chiang troops in Kinmen a chance to repent, our Fujian front troops voluntarily ceased bombing the Chiang troops in Kinmen on the 4th. Since the 4th, our front artillery units have not fired a single shot. However, the Chiang troops, who are cruel by nature and willing to be running dogs of U.S. imperialism, continue to bombard our peaceful coastal residents. At 16:20 on the 4th and 10:55 on the 5th, the Chiang troops' artillery continuously shelled Xiamen and nearby villages. The Chiang troops also took advantage of our cessation of shelling to use American-made large transport aircraft and American-made ships to transport Chiang troops and war materials to reinforce Kinmen on the 4th and 5th. Our front-line military and civilians are extremely angry about this action of the Chiang troops, who have no intention of repenting, and express their intolerance.

Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, 6th: The artillery of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous troops entrenched in Greater Kinmen frantically shelled the residential area of Jiangtou Town in Xiamen City at 10:46 on the 6th. Twenty-four residents were wounded and eleven were killed. Most of them were students of Jiangtou Town No. 3 Middle School who were in class. Our front-line military and civilians expressed extreme anger at the brutal crimes of the Chiang bandit troops.

    蒋贼执迷不悟继续增援金门炮轰沿海村镇
　　我前线军民表示不能容忍
    新华社福建前线6日电　台湾蒋介石卖国集团连日继续增援金门，并且不断炮轰我沿海村镇。
    为了给金门蒋军以悔悟的机会，我福建前线部队曾在4日主动停止了对金门蒋军的轰击，4日以来我前线炮兵部队一弹未发。但是残民成性、甘作美帝国主义走狗的蒋军，却继续炮轰我沿海和平居民。4日十六时二十分，5日十时五十五分，蒋军炮兵曾连续炮击我厦门及其附近村镇。蒋军并利用我停止炮击的机会，在4、5两日内用美制大型运输飞机和美制舰艇，载运蒋军人员和作战物资增援金门。对蒋军这种毫无悔祸之心的行动，我前线军民极为愤恨，表示不能容忍。
    新华社厦门6日电　盘踞在大金门的蒋介石卖国贼军队的炮兵，于6日十时四十六分疯狂炮击我厦门市江头镇居民区。居民当被击伤二十四名，死亡十一人。其中大部是正在上课的江头镇第三中学的学生。我前线军民对蒋贼军这种残暴罪行表示异常愤怒。
