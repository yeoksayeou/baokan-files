Xinhua News Agency, 11th—On September 11th, starting from 11:19 AM, four US warships escorting Chiang Kai-shek's transport ships to Jinmen successively intruded into our territorial waters of the Jinmen and Xiamen areas. The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, upon instruction, stated: The US government, disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese government and the imminent resumption of the Sino-US ambassadorial talks in Warsaw, has continuously used its navy and air force to invade our territorial waters and airspace in the past five days. This clearly shows to the world that the US government has not yet abandoned its adventurous and provocative behavior against China. The Chinese government hereby issues its fourth serious warning regarding this.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 11th, 3 PM—A spokesperson for our military on the Fujian Front declared: The Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on Jinmen and its nearby islands, after our continuous warnings and two punitive strikes, not only show no remorse but also frantically shelled our Xiamen University on the 9th. Today, four transport ships of the Taiwan Chiang army, shamelessly relying on the protection of US warships, carried large numbers of soldiers and supplies in an attempt to reinforce Jinmen. In order to once again warn the Taiwan Kuomintang clique, our artillery forces on the Fujian Front today launched a third punitive strike against the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on Jinmen and the Chiang Kai-shek transport ships attempting to reinforce them.

    美舰美机连续侵犯我领海领空
    我政府第四次提出严重警告
    炮兵第三次惩罚金门蒋军和增援蒋舰
    新华社11日讯　9月11日上午十一时十九分起，掩护蒋军运输舰开往金门的美国军舰四艘，先后侵入我国金门、厦门地区的领海。我外交部发言人奉命声明：美国政府不顾中国政府的再三警告，不顾中美两国大使级会谈即将在华沙恢复，竟在最近五天内连续以海军和空军侵犯我国领海和领空，这就再清楚不过地向世界表明，美国政府至今还没有放弃对中国的冒险挑衅行为。中国政府对此第四次提出严重警告。
    新华社福建前线11日下午三时电　福建前线我军发言人宣称：盘据金门及其附近岛屿的蒋军，在我连续警告和两次惩罚性打击后，不仅毫无悔悟，反而在9日疯狂地炮击我厦门大学。今日，台湾蒋军运输舰四艘又无耻地依靠美国军舰的掩护，载运大批兵员和物资，企图增援金门。为了再一次警告台湾国民党集团，我福建前线炮兵部队今日下午对盘据金门的蒋军和企图增援金门的蒋军运输舰只，进行了第三次的惩罚性打击。
