How to Lead the People's Commune Movement?

Guanghua County, Hubei Province, with a population of 250,000 agricultural people, recently launched a major debate on the superiority of people's communes and how to run them. Through the debate, the communist consciousness of the broad masses of commune members has been greatly enhanced. They said, "Small cooperatives are a small liberation, large cooperatives are a large liberation, and people's communes are a thorough liberation." All agricultural cooperative members have demanded to set up people's communes, resulting in a massive movement to establish people's communes.

The Guanghua County Party Committee has consistently and conscientiously led this movement. The following are some experiences and lessons learned in leading this movement.

How to Determine the Scale of Commune Construction?

To establish people's communes throughout the county, it is necessary to combine leadership with the masses, and superiors with subordinates, to fully deliberate and repeatedly study the scale and layout of the communes, and to conduct debates among the broad masses. At the beginning in Guanghua County, the County Party Committee planned to merge two small cooperatives into one, but this was rejected by the masses' demands before it was even proposed. Immediately afterwards, the County Party Committee considered merging into a large cooperative based on the original township, but this still could not meet the needs of the masses and could not adapt to the development of production. Finally, after repeated discussions combining top and bottom, it was decided to establish eight people's communes throughout the county. Why were eight communes determined? Based on what conditions?

	1. Based on the water conservancy system, it is convenient for construction and irrigation;
	2. It is conducive to the comprehensive development of production and the combination of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs;
	3. Based on the economic center, such as the distribution of market towns;
	4. Based on the vastness and concentration of the terrain, taking into account the original administrative divisions to facilitate leadership.

After the preparatory committee of the commune is established, it is necessary to immediately grasp planning, roughly determining the commune's overall production development plan and the plan for the people's living conditions, so that the masses have an understanding of the commune's long-term and near-term prospects. Experience has shown that this approach has a great effect and is inspiring. After the commune is built, more detailed planning should be done for the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and the mutual integration of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. The 1959 production plan and this year's winter sowing plan should be carried out as early as possible. Doing so has a great effect on building and running the commune well.

What are the Reactions of Various Classes of People?

Establishing people's communes is not just a matter of merging large cooperatives, it is a great change in the economic life, political life, and production relations of society, and in-depth ideological mobilization must be carried out. Throughout the county, vigorously publicize the nature and superiority of people's communes and the purpose and policies of establishing people's communes. Launch a nationwide mass debate movement centered on the topics of "Are people's communes good? Should we establish them? How big should they be? Can they be run well? Should we participate?", and widely adopt recall and comparison methods, starting from summarizing production and summarizing the cooperative movement to conduct discussions, so that everyone feels that from individual farming to mutual aid, elementary cooperatives, advanced cooperatives, and people's communes, the path is becoming clearer, production is developing more and more, and life is improving more and more. This has set off a booming high tide of joining the communes. During the publicity and mobilization period, more than 300,000 big-character posters and letters of determination were posted throughout the county, and almost everyone expressed their attitude. This is an unprecedented phenomenon. A very moving big-character poster from the Xinlian Brigade of the Satellite Commune said, "The Communist Party is a good leader, the path of cooperation is cleverly taken. In the early days of liberation, we engaged in mutual aid, exchanging what we have to promote production. In 1954, we established elementary cooperatives, and cooperatives are even better than mutual aid. In 1956, we established advanced cooperatives, the right to private land was abolished, collective production has many benefits, and the lives of cooperative members have improved. It's a pity that the land is a bit small, and the construction of water conservancy is limited; it is inconvenient to use machines, and it is not easy to specialize in division of labor. To have a better life, we cannot be without people's communes. The five-in-one is all included, and the five are closely integrated. The commune is large, there are many people, and the strength is strong. Industry and agriculture are developed at the same time, technology and culture are fully developed, and people's lives are even better. The leadership of the Communist Party is good, leading us to run forward. The collective strength of the masses is great, and people's communes can be run well! Can be run well!"

Establishing people's communes is a major change. The attitudes of various classes towards this movement are also different. Poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants are happy and actively support it. They spread the news, contacted each other, stayed up all night, and demanded to establish communes. All localities have convened meetings of poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants in their original cooperatives to conduct education and mobilization, improve their awareness, and then rely on them to enlighten the middle peasants and prepare for connection. Some well-to-do middle peasants are also willing to switch to communes, but they have many doubts and concerns. They are more concerned about the grain under their noses (trees, houses), and even some individuals have misunderstandings. These people must be publicized and explained to dispel misunderstandings; some capitalist behaviors should be criticized. In the process of establishing communes, some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, rightists, and bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors, sabotage, and stir up trouble. Therefore, we must resolutely implement the class line, firmly rely on the poor peasants, unite the middle peasants, and resolutely strike at landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, rightists, and bad elements who dare to spread rumors and sabotage.

Handing Policies Over to the Masses

At the beginning of the people's commune movement, some problems were discovered: for example, cadres were afraid of reduced treatment, wealthy cooperatives were afraid of suffering losses, some cooperatives did not understand this year's distribution, and some wealthy middle peasants were afraid of "mixing everything together." According to the spirit of the instructions of the higher party committee, the Guanghua County Party Committee mainly grasped the following principles: 1. Take conformity with the party's general line of building socialism as the basic principle; 2. Handling all specific problems must be conducive to production; 3. Adhere to the socialist distribution system of distribution according to labor and more pay for more work; 4. Conduct a profound communist ideological education for cadres and the masses in order to eliminate ideological obstacles in dealing with certain specific problems. In addition to educating the broad masses about the nature and purpose of the commune, it is necessary to talk about the communist spirit and the communist style, explaining that individualism, departmentalism, and capitalism are incompatible with communism.

One of the first problems encountered in the movement was that some grassroots cadres became somewhat agitated when they heard that small cooperatives were to be merged into people's communes. Therefore, the County Party Committee decided that the original township and cooperative cadres should generally remain at their original levels and salaries, and that cadres who were no longer engaged in production should still be supplied by the state. Cadres whose positions had changed should also be quickly arranged for, which quickly stabilized the mood of the cadres. For example, Sun Mingdao, the branch secretary of the Qunli Cooperative in the original Guanghua Township, heard that a people's commune was going to be established and was afraid that he would not be able to be a cadre, so he went to the conscription bureau to ask for a job. When he heard that the small cooperative was changed to a large brigade, and that he was still the branch secretary of the large brigade, he became active again and immediately called the cooperative to arrange production.

Secondly, in the establishment of people's communes, the most important concern of the various small cooperatives is this year's distribution and public accumulation, and the debts of the various small cooperatives. After discussion, the County Party Committee made some specific regulations in a timely manner:

	1. All the original public accumulation of the various small cooperatives shall belong to the people's commune, and shall not be concealed or privately divided. During the movement, some cadres and members of some small cooperatives with more public accumulation and better natural conditions had ideological resistance to this. It is necessary to conduct communist ideological education for them, guide them to look forward, and broaden their horizons, and not to haggle over every penny. They must also realize that the poorer the cooperative, the greater the production potential; clean up and register the original public accumulation of the small cooperatives, and do not allow private division, concealment, or damage to public property; the members' shareholding funds shall be transferred and registered to the people's commune.

	2. This autumn's crops will generally still be distributed by each cooperative, and the proportion of deductions will be determined by the people's commune based on the increase in production of each cooperative. No speculation or deception, under-deduction or non-deduction is allowed.

	3. The debts owed by each small cooperative that belong to the production investment of the year, such as fertilizers and pesticides, which have already had income last year, shall be repaid by the small cooperative itself. If the production of this year is reduced due to disasters and there is no ability to repay, it can be repaid by the people's commune after consultation. The debts belonging to capital construction shall be borne by the commune.

	4. The original draft cattle, farm tools, and other means of production and the sideline occupations operated by the various small cooperatives shall still be used, managed, and operated by the cooperatives. The production preparations for next year, such as winter sowing preparations, should still be prepared by the various small cooperatives, so as not to affect next year's Great Leap Forward. Seeds for next autumn should be retained according to needs and arranged uniformly by the large commune.

	5. The collective sideline occupations operated by the original production team shall still belong to the production team, but shall not be divided up.

Third, what the members, especially the well-to-do middle peasant members, are most concerned about is what belongs to the commune and what belongs to the members personally. The policies should be explained clearly and thoroughly to the masses. According to Guanghua's experience: first, publicize that all land belongs to the commune; second, publicize that after the land belongs to the commune, members can still use the commune's land and can still plant their own necessary crops (vegetables, tobacco leaves) on the commune's land, but it must be approved by the commune; third, publicize that houses, scattered trees, etc. still belong to the members personally; fourth, publicize that if necessary within the commune, the commune can reasonably convert the members' private trees and large tools into public property.

Such publicity is reasonable and satisfactory to the masses, and people feel comfortable and there is no tension. Even the concerns of the well-to-do middle peasants have been largely dispelled.

Taking Production as the Center
Taking Commune Establishment as the Driving Force

Guanghua County has done a good job of combining production and commune establishment in the process of establishing communes, truly achieving the convergence of two high tides. Because the various cooperatives and members all demanded to switch to communes, they were particularly active in production; in particular, the superiority of the commune was displayed, which further stimulated the masses' desire to establish communes. The various small cooperatives have put forward the slogan of "Do a good job in production to welcome the establishment of the commune" and "Work hard for a month to make achievements and present them to the people's commune," which has greatly promoted the current production.

After the framework of the people's commune is set up, it is necessary to start arranging the production of each cooperative and concentrate a part of the labor force to attack the weak links in the current production, which is extremely encouraging to the members. The Dongfeng People's Commune put forward the bold slogan of "Go all out to strive for the upstream, strive to take the lead in the country, guarantee to launch six satellites, and make a splash in the world." They deep-plowed more than 3,200 mu of land within ten days.

After the people's commune is established, it is necessary to quickly establish organizational structures, and cadres must be assigned positions and locations. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the work should be divided and carried out so that production management can quickly get on track and production order can be quickly established.

When establishing organizational structures, each commune generally follows the principles of being conducive to production, being conducive to work, being conducive to unity, the organization should not be large, the number of cadres who are no longer engaged in production should not be increased, and the upper level should move but the lower level should not move. Under these principles, the leadership structures established by each commune are largely the same. The current situation is: each people's commune is formed with the past guidance team as the core, implementing the integration of township and commune. Commune cadres realize the division of leadership through the united team (not a level of organization). Below the commune is the production brigade, which is the original small cooperative. Below the production brigade is the production team, which is the original production team. The commune has a Party Committee and a Management Committee, and the Management Committee is also the Township People's Committee.

After the organization is established, cadres should be quickly positioned, the current production should be well arranged, leadership should be vigorously carried out, all negative waiting and departmentalism should be prevented, and arrangements and leadership should be given to the work of contracting production to teams and households for winter sowing crops and autumn harvest distribution, as well as the decentralization of power to cooperatives and teams.

After the commune is established, it is necessary to do consolidation work. First of all, we must prominently grasp the current production, and prominently do a few things that small cooperatives cannot do, and show the superiority of the people's commune. For example, after the Happiness People's Commune was built, it immediately dispatched 100 people to form a road construction team, and they repaired a road more than ten miles long in two days. Originally, a middle school was to be built here, but each cooperative was afraid of occupying land and unwilling to provide labor, so it had not been built for a long time. After the people's commune was established, construction began immediately. Now, the various people's communes are using the methods of mass airing of views, mass debates, and big-character posters to formulate production and construction plans for next year and plans for building socialism. Through current production and the formulation of future plans, various specific problems are further resolved in a thorough and detailed manner.

    怎样领导人民公社运动？
    中共湖北省委农村工作部副部长
    中共光化县委第一书记　郑少波
    湖北光化县二十五万农业人口最近展开了一场大辩论，辩论人民公社的优越性和怎样办社。通过辩论，广大社员共产主义觉悟大大提高，他们说，“小社是小翻身，大社是大翻身，人民公社是彻底翻身”。全体农业社员纷纷要求办人民公社，出现了规模巨大的办人民公社运动。
    中共光化县委自始至终认真领导了这个运动，以下就是领导这个运动的一些体会与经验。
    怎样确定建社规模？
    在全县范围内办人民公社，必须领导与群众、上级与下级相互结合，充分酝酿，反复研究公社的规模和布局，并应在广大群众中展开辩论。光化县开始时，县委计划两个小社并为一个社，没有端出来，就被群众的要求否定了。紧接着县委又考虑了以原乡为单位合并为一个大社，但是仍然不能满足群众的需要，不能适应生产的发展。最后经过上下结合反复讨论，确定全县建立八个人民公社。为什么确定八个社？根据哪些条件？
    一、根据水利系统，便于兴修和灌溉；
    二、有利于全面发展生产，有利于工农商学兵的结合；
    三、根据经济中心，例如集镇的分布情况；
    四、根据地形辽阔和集中程度，照顾原来的行政区划，做到便于领导。
    在公社的筹委会建立起来之后，就要马上抓规划，把公社的全面生产发展的规划，人民生活状况的规划大体订一下，使群众对公社的远景近景有个了解。经验证明，这种作法作用很大，鼓舞人心。在公社建成以后，要对农林牧副渔全面发展，工农商学兵互相结合，再做较为详细的规划，1959年的生产规划和今年冬播规划都应及早进行。这样做，对于建社和办好社作用很大。
    各阶层群众有哪些反映？
    办人民公社，不仅仅是个并大社的问题，它是社会的经济生活、政治生活以及生产关系的一个伟大变革，必须进行深入的思想发动工作。在全县范围内大张旗鼓地宣传人民公社的性质、优越性和办人民公社的目的、政策，开展全民性的以“人民公社好不好？办不办？办多大？能不能办好？参加不参加？”为中心论题的大鸣大放大辩论大字报运动，并广泛采取回忆对比方法，从总结生产，总结合作化运动入手进行讨论，使大家感到从单干到互助、初级社、高级社、人民公社越走越明，越来生产越发展，越来生活越改善，这样就掀起了轰轰烈烈的入社高潮。全县在宣传动员时期共贴了大字报、决心书三十多万张，几乎人人都表示了态度，这是空前未有的现象。卫星社新联大队贴了一张人民公社能办好的大字报极为动人：“共产党，领导好，合作化道路走的巧，解放初期搞互助，互通有无把生产搞。54年办了初级社，合作社又比互助好。56年又办高级社，私有土地权取消，集体生产好处多，社员生活都提高。可惜地片有点小，兴修水利限制了；使用机器不方便，分工专业不好搞。要得日子再过好，人民公社离不了。五位一体全在内，五者紧密相结合，社大人多力量强，工业农业同时搞，技术文化全发展，人民生活更提高。共产党的领导好，领导咱们向前跑，群众集体力量大，人民公社能办好！能办好！”
    建立人民公社是个大变革。各阶层对这一运动的态度也是不同的。贫农和新老下中农是欢欣鼓舞积极拥护的。他们奔走相告，互相串联，通宵不眠，要求办公社。各地都以原有社为单位，召开了贫农和新老下中农会议，进行教育和发动，提高觉悟，然后依靠他们去开导中农酝酿串联。一些富裕中农虽然也愿意转公社，却有不少怀疑顾虑，他们对于鼻子底下一粒米（树木、房屋）顾虑较多，甚至个别的还有误解。对于这些人必须进行宣传解释，解除误会；对于一些资本主义行为应进行批判。在办公社中，一些地主、富农、反革命分子、右派分子和坏分子却又乘机造谣破坏、兴风作浪。因而我们必须坚决贯彻执行阶级路线，坚决依靠贫农，团结中农，对胆敢进行造谣破坏的地主、富农、反革命分子、右派分子、坏分子坚决给以打击。
    把政策交给群众
    人民公社运动一开始，便发现这样的一些问题：例如干部怕降低待遇，富社怕吃亏，有的社对今年分配不摸底，一些富裕中农怕“大合泥”。光化县委根据上级党委指示的精神，主要掌握了以下几个原则：1、以符合党的建设社会主义的总路线为基本原则；2、处理一切具体问题都必须有利生产；3、坚持按劳取酬、多劳多得的社会主义分配制度；4、对干部和群众进行一次深刻的共产主义思想教育，以便扫除在处理某些具体问题上的思想障碍。在广大群众中除了进行公社的性质、目的的教育以外，必须讲共产主义精神和讲共产主义风格，说明个人主义、本位主义和资本主义都是与共产主义不相容的。
    在运动中首先碰到的一个问题是有些基层干部听说小社要合并成人民公社，思想有些波动。于是县委确定原来的乡社干部一般都原级原薪不动，脱产干部仍由国家供给，对一些职务有变动的干部也应迅速安排好，这样就很快地安定了干部情绪。如原光化乡群利社分支书孙明道听说要办人民公社，怕自己当不成干部，到兵役局要求工作；当他听说小社改为大队，他仍为大队的支书，他又积极起来，马上给社里打电话布置生产。
    其次在建立人民公社中，各小社最关心的是今年的分配和公共积累、各小社的债务等问题，县委经过讨论，及时做了一些具体规定：
    1、各小社原有的公共积累，统统归人民公社所有，不得隐瞒私分。在运动中一些公共积累较多，自然条件较好的小社的一些干部和社员在思想上有抵触，这就要向他们进行共产主义的思想教育，引导他们向前看，把眼光放远，不要斤斤计较，还要使他们认识到越是穷社生产潜力越大；对原有小社的公共积累清理登记，不准私分，不准隐瞒，更不准破坏公共财产；社员的股分基金，转账登记归人民公社。
    2、今年秋季庄稼一般地仍然由各社自行分配，根据各社增产幅度由人民公社确定扣留比例，不准投机取巧、少扣和不扣。
    3、各小社所欠债务属于当年生产投资的如肥料、农药等，去年已经有了收入，由小社自行偿还。今年因灾减产无力偿还的，经过协商可以归人民公社偿还。属于基本建设的债务，归公社负责偿还。
    4、各小社原来的耕牛、农具等生产资料和经营的副业，仍归各社使用管理和经营。对于下年的生产准备如冬播准备，仍由各小社准备好，不能影响明年大跃进。明年秋季种子要按需要留足，由大社统一安排。
    5、原生产队经营的集体副业仍归生产队所有，但不能分掉。
    第三，社员们特别是富裕中农社员，最关心的是什么归公社所有，什么归社员个人所有。应该把政策在群众中讲明讲透。根据光化经验：第一要宣传一切土地统归公社所有；第二要宣传土地归社以后社员仍可以使用社的土地，仍可以在社的土地上种植自己必需的作物（菜、烟叶），但必须经公社批准；第三要宣传房屋、零星树木等仍归社员个人所有；第四要宣传社内如有必需时，可以将社员私有的树木、大型工具合理折价归公。
    这样宣传通情达理，群众满意，人心舒畅，没有什么紧张情绪。就是富裕中农的顾虑也解除了不少。
    以生产为中心
    以办社为动力
    光化县办公社的过程中很好的做到了生产办社两结合，真正做到了两个高潮汇流在一起。因为各个社和社员都要求转公社，对于生产特别积极；特别是显示了公社的优越性，更加激发了群众办公社的要求。各小社都提出了“搞好生产，迎接建社”“苦战一月做出成绩向人民公社献礼”的口号，这样做对当前的生产推动很大。
    人民公社的架子搭起来后，就开始安排各社的生产，并集中一部分劳力突击当前生产的薄弱环节，这对社员鼓舞极大。东风人民公社提出了“鼓足干劲争上游，争取全国占鳌头，卫星保证放六个，世界上也要出出头”的豪迈口号，他们在十天以内深翻土地三千二百多亩。
    人民公社建立起来以后要迅速建立组织机构，干部要定职、定位，在党委的领导下分工进行工作，使生产管理迅速走向轨道，使生产秩序迅速建立起来。
    各公社建立组织机构时，一般根据有利生产，有利工作，有利团结，机构不要庞大，脱产干部不要增多，上动下不动的原则。在这些原则下各公社大同小异的建立了领导机构。现在的情况是：各人民公社是以过去的指导组为核心组成，实行乡社合一。公社干部通过联队（不是一级组织）实现分片领导。公社下是生产大队，也就是原来的小社。生产大队下面是生产小队，即原来生产队。公社内有党委会、管委会，管委会也就是乡人民委员会。
    机构建立好就使干部迅速定位，要把当前生产做很好的安排，大力进行领导，防止一切消极等待和本位主义，并且对于冬播作物的包工包产和秋收分配等工作，以及社队分权等均加以安排和领导。
    社建立起来后，就要做巩固工作。首先要突出的抓住当前生产，并突出地办几件小社办不到的事情，显示一下人民公社的优越性。如幸福人民公社建成后，马上抽掉一百人成立修路队，两天就把十多里长的路修好了。原来这里要建一所中学，各社都怕占地，又不愿出劳力，很长时间没建起来，成立人民公社以后，马上就开始兴建。现在各人民公社正在用大放大鸣大辩论大字报的办法，制定明年的生产建设规划和建成社会主义的规划。通过当前生产和制定今后规划，进一步深入细致的解决各种具体问题。
