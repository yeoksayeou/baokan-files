　　African Carp in Guangxi
    In May of this year, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam gifted the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of our country with over two hundred African carp, which were put on trial rearing at the Nanning Aquatic Product Farming Experimental Station. After a period of two months, the African carp have grown from seven fen in length to about five cun.
    The African carp is an excellent species; each fish can grow to six jin in weight, and the meat is tender and delicious. Its characteristics include strong reproductive ability, high survival rate, omnivorous nature, and the ability to withstand heat and cold, as well as live in oxygen-deficient waters. This fish spawns five or six times a year (as often as once every two months), producing three hundred fifty to five hundred eggs each time. During spawning, the male fish first uses its head to dig a hole at the bottom of the pond for the female fish to lay eggs. After laying eggs, the male fish holds the eggs in its mouth, allowing the fry to hatch in its mouth. The survival rate of the fry can reach over 90%.

　　非洲鲫鱼在广西
    今年5月，越南民主共和国赠给我国广西僮族自治区二百余尾非洲鲫鱼，由南宁水产养殖实验场试养。经过两个月的时间，非洲鲫鱼体长已由七分长到五寸左右。
    非洲鲫鱼是一种优良品种，每尾可长到六斤重，肉质细嫩可口。它的特点是繁殖力很强，成活率很高，性杂食，能耐热耐寒，还能在缺氧的水域中生活。这种鱼一年产卵五、六次（两月即可产一次），每次可产卵三百五十到五百粒。产卵时，雄鱼先用头部在池塘底挖洞，给雌鱼产卵，产卵后，雄鱼用口含着卵粒，让幼鱼在口中孵化。幼鱼成活率可达90％以上。
