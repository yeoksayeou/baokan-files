Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 9th. The Vietnamese Labor Party's newspaper "People's Daily" today published Chairman Mao Zedong's important speech on the current situation at the Supreme State Council meeting under a large headline on the front page. "People's Daily" also published an editorial supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area.

The "People's Daily" editorial said that the Chinese government's attitude is completely in line with the most basic and common attitude of all countries in safeguarding their sovereignty and territorial integrity, and is completely in line with the interests of defending world peace. The editorial pointed out that the statement issued by the People's Republic of China is the voice of the 600 million people who have been liberated on the Chinese mainland and the people of Taiwan, Kinmen, and Matsu Islands who are still struggling under the iron heel of the US-Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The editorial said that the people of Korea and Vietnam, who are having parts of their national territory occupied by US imperialism, and the people of other Asian countries who are being enslaved or threatened by the United States, deeply realize that the US imperialist conspiracy in the Taiwan region is closely related to the US's further aggression conspiracies against these countries, and is a serious threat to peace. Therefore, the people of Asia and the world must never stand idly by in the face of this situation.

Today's short commentary in the "Hanoi Daily" said that US imperialism is like an insatiable frog, wanting to swallow Lebanon, Singapore... and also wanting to swallow Kinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan. But as the interesting fable says, this frog, puffing up its belly to compete with the water buffalo, will one day burst its belly and die.

Hanoi's newspapers today all published the Chinese government's serious warning about the US warships invading Chinese territorial waters on the front page and the international page.

　　美帝国主义向中国挑衅  亚洲人民绝不袖手旁观
    越南“人民报”支持我国政府声明
    据新华社河内9日电　越南劳动党机关报“人民报”今天以头版大字标题刊载毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上就目前形势发表的重要讲话。“人民报”并发表社论支持周恩来总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明。
    “人民报”的社论说，中国政府的态度完全符合各国维护本身主权和领土完整的最基本的和最普通的态度，完全符合保卫世界和平事业的利益。社论指出，中华人民共和国发出的声明，是已经在中国大陆上解放了的六亿人民和仍在美蒋集团铁蹄下进行斗争的台湾、金门、马祖等岛的人民的呼声。
    社论说，正被美帝国主义占领着本国国土一部分的朝鲜和越南人民，以及正在被美国奴役或威胁着的亚洲其他国家的人民，都深刻地认识到美帝国主义在台湾地区的阴谋，是同美国对这些国家的进一步侵略阴谋有着密切关系的，并且是对和平的严重威胁。因此，亚洲和世界人民绝不能在这种局势面前袖手旁观。
    “河内每日报”今天发表的短评说，美帝国主义像一只贪得无厌的青蛙，它想吞下黎巴嫩、新加坡……又想吞下金门、马祖和台湾。但是正同有趣的寓言所说的，这只鼓起肚子来想赛过水牛的青蛙，终有一天将把肚子鼓破而一命鸣呼。
    河内各家日报今天都在头版和国际版刊登中国政府就美国军舰侵入中国领海而提出的严重警告。
