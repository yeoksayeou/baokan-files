    Good Job Grabbing It
  　Hua Gong
    In the current nationwide movement for steel, ferrosilicon and ferromanganese are in general emergency. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry timely convened a ferroalloy production conference, exchanged production experience, and formulated measures to increase production. This move is well done!
    Saying it's well done means it has grasped the key issue, grasped it at the "critical juncture."
    As the saying goes: steel should be used on the cutting edge of a knife. This means that no matter what you do, you must use your strength in the main area, that is, grasp the key. In the development process of every thing, there is always the movement of contradictions. The process of constantly solving contradictions is the process of continuous advancement of things. In the booming nationwide steel production movement, ferrosilicon and ferromanganese are indispensable raw materials for steelmaking. Without them, steelmaking would be difficult. This is a contradiction to increasing steel production. From the current situation, because the output of China's original ferroalloy factories cannot meet the needs of the rapid development of steel output, and the newly built electric furnaces for smelting ferroalloys cannot be put into production immediately; while using a large number of indigenous blast furnaces to make steel from indigenous iron requires more ferrosilicon to adjust the quality of the indigenous iron. Therefore, in this lean period, the contradiction of insufficient ferrosilicon and ferromanganese becomes more prominent, and greatly increasing the production of ferrosilicon and ferromanganese has become a key issue at present. Therefore, we must grasp this contradiction and work together to solve it in all provinces and cities. When the contradiction is resolved, the steel output will inevitably leap forward.
    From the ferroalloy production conference held by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, it can also be seen that although the current contradiction is very prominent, as long as we seriously grasp it and grasp it tightly, it can definitely be solved. For example, the Shijiazhuang Xinde Calcium Carbide Chemical Plant has only thirty-six employees and only one transformer, one electric furnace, one electric mill, and one electrode device. However, because the party branch secretary and the factory director went to the workshop to direct, the workers worked hard for four days and nights, and produced high-quality ferrosilicon. There are a number of such calcium carbide chemical plants all over the country. If they can all seriously grasp this key issue like the Xinde Calcium Carbide Chemical Plant, then the supply of ferrosilicon will be easy to handle.
    The problem now is that all localities must have a deep understanding of the special and important significance of the current key issue of insufficient ferrosilicon and ferromanganese. Because when everyone fully understands the contradictory movement of things, they will definitely be able to find a way to solve the contradiction, and they will definitely be able to solve it.

    抓得好
  　华工
    在当前全民为钢铁而战的运动中，矽铁和锰铁普遍告急。冶金工业部及时召开了铁合金生产会议，交流了生产经验，制订了增产措施，这一着抓得好！
    说抓得好，是说抓住了关键问题，抓在“节骨眼”上。
    俗话说：钢要使在刀刃上。意思是说，无论做任何事情，都要把力量用在主要方面，也就是说要抓关键。每一事物的发展过程中自始至终地存在着矛盾运动，不断解决矛盾的过程，就是事物不断前进的过程。在轰轰烈烈展开的全民的钢铁生产运动中，矽铁和锰铁是必不可缺的炼钢原料，缺少它，炼钢就有困难，这是增加钢产量的一个矛盾。而从目前情况看来，因为我国原有的铁合金工厂的产量不能满足钢产量急剧发展的需要，新建冶炼铁合金的电炉又不能立即投入生产；而利用大量土高炉的土铁炼钢，恰恰又需要较多的矽铁来调整土铁质量，因此，在这青黄不接的当儿，矽铁、锰铁不足这一矛盾就显得更加突出，大力增产矽铁、锰铁就成为当前的一个关键问题了。所以，必须抓住这个矛盾，各省、市一齐努力加以解决。等到把矛盾解决了，钢产量就必然会向前飞跃一大步。
    从冶金部这次召开的铁合金生产会议也可以看出，当前这个矛盾虽然十分突出，只要认真去抓，抓得紧，就一定能够解决。像石家庄信德电石化工厂，论职工只有三十六人，论设备只有变压器一台，电炉、电碾、电极设备各一座，但是，由于该厂党支部书记和厂长深入车间指挥，职工们苦干了四昼夜，就生产出了质量优良的矽铁。全国各地有一批这样的电石化工厂，假如都能像信德电石化工厂这样认真地去抓这个关键问题，那么矽铁的供应就好办了。
    现在的问题在于各地对当前矽铁、锰铁不足这一关键问题特殊的、重要的意义，必须要有深刻的认识。因为当大家充分认识到了事物的矛盾运动，他就一定能找到解决矛盾的方法，并且一定能解决它。
