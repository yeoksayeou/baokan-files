Welcome "Korean Film Week"
　　Cai Chusheng

The people of China and Korea achieved a great victory in the war against American imperialism. Due to the heavy blows dealt by the people of both countries, American imperialism had no choice but to sit down for negotiations and sign the armistice agreement. Not long ago, the U.S. State Department even lamented its defeat on the Korean battlefield, saying that "the United States suffered 142,000 casualties" (the actual number is of course more than that). However, recently, American imperialism seems to have forgotten the lesson and dares to carry out war provocations against our country in the Taiwan Strait. But the facts of history show that the U.S. imperialists are nothing but paper tigers, and all their war conspiracies will inevitably end in shameful failure.

In defending world peace and safeguarding our common socialist cause, the people of China and Korea have formed a close friendship. This friendship has been fully reflected in the films of our two countries, giving great encouragement and education to the people of China and Korea.

The film exchange between China and Korea has greatly developed in the past few years. We have held several film weeks with each other. Over the years, Korean films shown in our country, such as "My Hometown," "Young Guerrilla," "Scout," and "Guerrilla Girl," have been warmly welcomed by our audiences.

The "Korean Film Week" held to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will help our people further understand the Korean people and enhance the brotherly friendship between the two peoples. The films "For the Fatherland" and "Fishing Village River" screened this film week depict the Korean people's struggle against imperialist aggression in two different periods. "For the Fatherland" is a film depicting the Korean people's struggle for the independence and liberation of their motherland during the Japanese imperialist invasion. It successfully shaped the heroic image of the Korean people and is very vivid and moving. "Fishing Village River" depicts the Korean people's resistance to American imperialist aggression. It movingly tells the fact that the Korean People's Army, with the support of the Korean people, defeated the American robbers in the Fishing Village River campaign, showing the flesh-and-blood ties between the Korean People's Army and the people. These two films not only have a political content of great significance in opposing imperialist aggression, but also have achieved great artistic achievements. The films are full of patriotism and revolutionary optimism, have good artistic forms, and the director and photography art have many new applications and creations. From these two films, we can see that the Korean film industry has always adhered to the socialist path and has achieved great new achievements. This is commendable.

This "Korean Film Week" will, as in the past, be warmly welcomed by our audiences. We wish the film screening success and wish the Korean film industry greater achievements in advancing along the road of socialist creation.

### 欢迎“朝鲜电影周”

　　欢迎“朝鲜电影周”
    蔡楚生
    中朝两国人民在抗击美帝国主义的战争中，取得了巨大的胜利。由于两国人民的狠狠打击，美帝国主义不得不坐下来谈判，签订停战协定。前不久，美国国务院还就它在朝鲜战场上的失败发出哀鸣，说“美国遭受了十四万两千人的伤亡”（事实当然不止此数），不过，最近，美帝国主义似乎又忘记了教训，居然敢在我国台湾海峡地区，对我国进行战争挑衅。但是，历史的事实表明，美帝不过是一只纸老虎，它的一切战争阴谋，都最后必然要遭到可耻的失败。
    在保卫世界和平和维护我们共同的社会主义事业中，中朝两国人民结成了亲密的友谊。这种友谊在我们两国的电影中都得到了充分的反映，给了中朝人民以极大的鼓舞和教育。
    中朝两国的电影交流，在过去几年里，有了很大的发展。我们相互举行了数次电影周。历年来在我国放映的朝鲜影片，像“我的故乡”、“少年游击队”、“侦察兵”、“游击队的姑娘”等，都受到了我国观众的热烈欢迎。
    为庆祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国建国十周年举行的“朝鲜电影周”，将有助于我国人民对朝鲜人民更进一步的了解，增强两国人民的兄弟友谊。这次电影周放映的“为祖国而战”和“渔郎川”是描写两个不同时期的朝鲜人民反对帝国主义侵略斗争的影片。“为祖国而战”是描写在日本帝国主义侵略时期，朝鲜人民为自己祖国的独立和解放而斗争的影片，它成功地塑造了朝鲜人民的英雄形象，十分生动感人。“渔郎川”是描写朝鲜人民反抗美帝国主义的侵略的，它动人地叙述了朝鲜人民军在朝鲜人民的支援下，在渔郎川战役中打败美国强盗的事实，表现了朝鲜人民军队和人民的血肉联系。这两部影片不仅有着反对帝国主义侵略这样一个具有重大意义的政治内容，在艺术上也取得了很大的成就。影片充满了爱国主义和革命的乐观主义精神，有着很好的艺术形式，导演和摄影艺术也都有许多新的运用和创造。从这两部影片里，我们看出，朝鲜电影事业是一直坚持沿着社会主义的道路前进的，并取得了很大的新的成就。这是值得称赞的。
    这次“朝鲜电影周”的举行，也将会和过去一样受到我国观众的热烈欢迎。我们谨祝这次电影映出的成功，祝朝鲜电影事业在沿着社会主义创作道路前进中取得更大的成就。
