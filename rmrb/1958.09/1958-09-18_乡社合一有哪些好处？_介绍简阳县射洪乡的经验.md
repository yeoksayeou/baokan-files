What are the Benefits of Township-Commune Merging?
    ——Introducing the Experience of Shehong Township, Jianyang County
    By Our Correspondent Zhou Zuyou
    Shehong Township, Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, has long implemented the integration of government and commune, merging the two sets of institutions of the township and the commune into one, providing centralized and unified leadership for the township's production, construction, and political work, and promoting the leaping development of the township's industry, agriculture, production and all other undertakings.

    How to Merge
    Shehong Township's implementation of the integration of government and commune began as early as December 1955, after the nine agricultural cooperatives in the township were merged into one large commune—the Liberation Commune. The method of integrating government and commune in Shehong Township first unified the three-level organizations of the township government and the agricultural commune, namely township and commune, village and cultivation area, and administrative group and production team, merging the two sets of institutions into one, and the two sets of personnel into one. The township head and deputy township head concurrently served as the commune director and deputy commune director, the secretary and deputy secretary of the township Party general branch concurrently served as the secretary and deputy secretary of the commune Party general branch, the director of the village people's congress concurrently served as the captain of the cultivation area; and unified Party branches were established, and the administrative group leader concurrently served as the production team leader. More than twenty production teams uniformly organized Party groups. Considering that the township people's congress is a grassroots organ of political power, and the agricultural commune is an economic organization, the township people's congress and the commune member representative congress adopted a method of simultaneous existence and basic unity. Basically, all forty-six township people's representatives are also commune member representatives, but in order to enable the commune member representative congress to more broadly reflect the opinions of the masses, seventy-nine commune member representatives were additionally elected from among the poor and middle peasants to jointly form the commune member representative congress. The nine members of the township people's committee also concurrently served as members of the commune management committee or the commune supervision committee, and ten cultivation area captains were absorbed to participate, jointly forming the commune management committee. When studying matters related to the work of the township government, the township people's congress or the township people's committee is convened for discussion and decision, and it is immediately implemented; matters related to commune affairs are studied and discussed by convening the commune member representative congress or the commune management committee. Under the management committee, the commune also established sections for agriculture, sideline occupations (including industry), security, and propaganda and education to manage various business operations.

    Neither Neglected
    After implementing the integration of government and commune, in order to ensure the strengthening of leadership over production and construction without weakening various political work, Shehong Township adopted many specific measures. (1) Strengthen Party leadership. The township Party general branch regularly studies the township government work and production work, makes unified arrangements and deployments according to priorities, and organizes the township's cadres to go all out or divide the work to complete them. (2) Clearly announce the responsibilities of cadres at all levels in the two aspects of township government and agricultural commune, and check and supervise them at any time to ensure their comprehensive completion. (3) The leading positions of various business departments under the commune management committee are all managed by the members of the township people's committee who are in charge of the same business work. For example, the deputy township head in charge of the township's financial work also serves as the director of the commune's finance section, which makes it easier for them to combine the various business work of the township and the commune to carry out comprehensive arrangements and unified leadership. (4) Among the members of the township people's committee, one member is designated as the clerk, who handles all the township's administrative affairs with all his/her strength, so that other cadres can get rid of tedious affairs work and concentrate their energy on leading production, and various administrative work can be completed smoothly.

    According to the practical experience of Shehong Township, after the integration of government and commune, due to the large number of commune affairs, it is necessary to decentralize power at different levels and implement a system of unified management and hierarchical administration, so as to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of commune cadres and members and promote the leaping progress of various production and construction work. The powers delegated by the Liberation Commune include six aspects: production planning, labor allocation and labor remuneration, capital construction, finance, profit distribution, and sideline management. In these aspects, cultivation areas and production teams have certain powers under the unified leadership of the commune and on the premise of ensuring the completion of the commune's plans, and they can arrange production according to local conditions and handle daily affairs in a flexible manner.

    Four Major Advantages
    In the two years since the implementation of the integration of government and commune, the vast number of cadres and commune members in Shehong Township have deeply realized the benefits of this change. They believe that the integration of government and commune has four major advantages: (1) After the integration of government and commune, the township government has changed from a purely administrative agency to an economic accounting unit, mastering the economic power of the township's production, finance, distribution, material allocation, and labor allocation, changing the past situation of each small agricultural cooperative acting on its own. Doing so can not only better implement the Party's policies and guidelines in the township's production and construction, but also concentrate the township's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to carry out some major constructions, solve many difficulties that were difficult to solve in the small commune era, and promote the comprehensive leaping progress of industry, agriculture, sideline occupations, and other diversified operations. In 1957, the unit area yield of the township's main crop, cotton, had increased from more than fifty jin in 1955 to more than seventy jin, and grain had also increased from 560 jin per mu to more than 700 jin; this year, the unit area yield of cotton will leap to more than 300 jin (lint), and grain will reach 1,500 jin. In 1957, the total amount of public accumulation in the township reached 170,000 yuan, while in 1955, the average public accumulation of the nine small communes was only 3,000 yuan per commune, and this year the township's public accumulation will exceed 1 million yuan. The township concentrated twenty-six kinds of technical talents in iron, wood, electrical machinery, etc., totaling about two hundred, and formed thirteen professional teams in industry and sideline occupations, opened ten industries such as agricultural tool repair, ironwork, phosphate mining, feed processing, bricks and tiles, and lime, and opened up diversified sideline occupations such as orchards, pig raising, vegetables, and sewing, and also established a power station. This year, the total income of the township's agriculture and sideline occupations will reach 1.6 million yuan, an increase of nearly two times compared with last year and two and a half times compared with the previous year.

    (2) Because the township government is also the agricultural commune management agency, mastering the township's economic power, various work such as finance, civil affairs, public security, and culture and education, which belong to the scope of political power work, have a stronger mass base and organizational guarantee. The township government can directly arrange and deploy these work uniformly within the commune, instead of carrying them out indirectly through various scattered small communes, and various work can be carried out more smoothly without discount. For example, the financial tasks that used to be the most laborious in the township government work, such as agricultural tax collection, agricultural product procurement, and loan recovery, are now arranged as early as possible by the cadres who uniformly manage the township and commune finances under the unified leadership of the township and commune, according to the income and expenditure of the agricultural commune, and food and other agricultural products or cash are prepared in advance, so that tasks such as agricultural tax, sales of agricultural products, or repayment of loans can be completed quickly and on time, and are rewarded by relevant departments. The work of preferential treatment and resettlement of demobilized soldiers is also done very well.

    (3) After the integration of government and commune, the organizational structure has been greatly streamlined. Township cadres concurrently manage the work of most commune cadres. The number of cadres detached from agricultural production in the township has been reduced by more than twenty compared with the past, which not only reduces the non-productive expenditures of the agricultural commune, making the non-productive work points of the commune drop from 2% to 3% of the total work points in the past to less than 1%; at the same time, including these more than twenty detached cadres, a total of forty-two township and commune cadres were sent down to the cultivation areas and production teams to strengthen the leadership of the production front line. Township cadres, after concurrently serving as commune cadres, are not only callers, but also executors, and must specifically handle various work within the commune. In this way, the work style of cadres at all levels has become more in-depth, directly participating in production, leading production, the relationship with the masses has become closer, and problems are discovered and solved more promptly. Now, the township has eliminated third-class cultivation areas and third-class production teams, so that various production and work can be developed comprehensively and in a balanced manner.

    (4) After the integration of government and commune, the vast number of cadres and the masses have greatly increased their collectivist thinking, and they can all consider issues from the perspective of the interests of the people of the whole township. If a cultivation area or production team has difficulties, the whole township immediately展开cooperation and help. They say: Only with great unity and great collaboration can there be a great leap forward.

    乡社合一有哪些好处？
    ——介绍简阳县射洪乡的经验
    本报记者　周祖佑
    四川省简阳县射洪乡长期以来实行政、社合一，把乡、社两套机构合并为一套机构，对全乡生产建设和政权工作进行集中统一的领导，促进了全乡工、农业生产和各项事业的飞跃发展。
    怎样合一
    射洪乡实行政、社合一是远在1955年12月，全乡九个农业合作社合并成一个大社——解放社后就开始的。射洪乡实行政、社合一的办法，首先是把乡和社、村和耕作区、行政小组和生产队等乡政权和农业社的三级组织全部统一起来，将两套机构合并成为一套机构，两套人马合并成为一套人马。乡长和副乡长兼任社长和副社长，乡党总支正、副书记兼任社党总支正、副书记，村人民代表主任兼任耕作区区队长；并统一成立党的分支部，行政小组长则兼任生产队长，有二十多个生产队统一组织了党小组。由于考虑到乡人民代表大会是基层政权机关，农业社是经济组织，这个乡的人民代表大会与社员代表大会采取同时并存、基本合一的办法。四十六个乡人民代表基本上全部是社员代表，但为了使社员代表大会更广泛地反映群众的意见，又在贫、中农中增选出七十九个社员代表，共同组成社员代表大会。乡人民委员会九个委员也同时兼任社管理委员会委员或社监察委员会委员，并吸收十个耕作区区队长参加，共同组成社的管理委员会。当研究有关乡政权工作时，就召开乡人民代表大会或乡人民委员会讨论、决定，并立即贯彻执行；有关社务工作，则召开社员代表大会或社管理委员会研究、讨论。在管理委员会下，这个社还设立了农业、副业
  （包括工业）、保卫、宣教等股，分管各项业务工作。
    两不偏废
    在实行政、社合一后，为了保证加强对生产建设的领导，又不削弱各项政权工作，射洪乡采取了许多具体措施。（1）加强党的领导。乡党总支定期对乡政权工作和生产工作进行研究，按轻重缓急作统一安排和部署，组织全乡干部全力以赴或分工完成。（2）明确宣布各级干部在乡政权和农业社两方面担负的责任，随时检查，督促他们全面完成。（3）社管理委员会下所设各业务部门的领导职务，全部由乡人民委员会分工管理，由同一业务工作的委员兼任。如分管乡财政工作的副乡长兼任社的财务股长，这样，就更便于他们把乡和社的各项业务工作结合起来，进行全面安排和统一领导。（4）在乡人民委员会委员中指定担任文书的一个委员，全力处理乡的各项行政事务，使其他干部摆脱繁琐的事务工作，集中精力领导生产，各项行政工作又得以顺利完成。
    根据射洪乡的实践经验，在政、社合一后，由于社大事繁，必须分级分权，实行统一经营、分级管理的制度，才能充分发挥广大社干、社员的积极性和创造性，推动各项生产建设工作向前跃进。解放社下放的权力包括生产计划、劳力调配和劳动报酬、基本建设、财务、收益分配、副业管理等六个方面。在这些方面，耕作区、生产队在社的统一领导、保证完成全社计划的前提下，都具有一定权力，因时因地制宜地安排生产，机动灵活地处理日常事务。
    四大优点
    在实行政、社合一两年多来，射洪乡广大干部和社员深深体会到这一变革的好处。他们认为政、社合一具有四大优越性：（1）在政、社合一后，乡政权由单纯的行政机构成为一个经济核算单位，掌握全乡生产、财务、分配、物资调拨、劳力调配等经济大权，改变了过去各个小农业社各自为政的状况。这样做，不仅能在全乡生产建设中更好地贯彻党的政策、方针，而且可以集中全乡人力、物力、财力进行一些主要建设，解决小社时期难以解决的许多困难，促进工业、农业、副业等多种经营的全面跃进。1957年，全乡主要农作物棉花的单位面积产量，已从1955年的五十多斤增加到七十斤多，粮食也由亩产五百六十斤增加到七百多斤；今年棉花单位面积产量将跃进到三百斤（皮棉）以上，粮食将达到一千五百斤。1957年这个乡公共积累总数达到十七万元，而1955年九个小社的公共积累平均每社只有三千元，今年全乡公共积累还将超过一百万元。这个乡集中了铁、木、电机等二十六种，总数约二百多个技术人才，组成工业、副业方面的十三个专业队，开办起农具修配、铁工、磷矿开采、饲料加工、砖瓦、石灰等十项工业，开辟了果园、养猪、蔬菜、缝纫等多种副业，还建立了发电站。今年这个乡农、副业总收入将达到一百六十万元，比去年增加近两倍，比前年增长两倍半。
    （2）由于乡政权同时又是农业社管理机构，掌握了全乡经济大权，属于政权工作范围的财经、民政、公安、文教等各项工作，就有了更加坚强的群众基础和组织保证。乡政权可以直接在社内统一安排和部署这些工作，而不再是通过各个分散的小社间接地进行，各项工作就能毫无折扣地更顺利地开展。比如乡政工作中过去最费力气的农业税征收、农业品采购、贷款收回等财经任务，现在由统一管理乡、社财务工作的干部在乡、社统一领导下，及早按农业社收支情况作出安排，事先将粮食等农产品或现金准备妥当，使农业税、出售农产品或归还贷款等任务就都能迅速按期完成，并受到有关部门的奖励。优抚和安置复员军人的工作也都做得很好。
    （3）政、社合一后，组织机构大为精简，乡干部兼管了大部分社干部的工作，全乡农业社脱产干部比过去减少二十多人，这不仅减少了农业社非生产开支，使全社非生产工分从过去占总工分数2％至3％降低到1％以下；同时，包括这二十多个脱产干部在内，全乡共把四十二个乡、社干部下放到耕作区和生产队，加强了生产第一线的领导。乡干部在兼任社干部后，不仅是号召者，也是执行者，必须具体处理社内各项工作。这样，各级干部工作作风都更加深入，直接参加生产，领导生产，与群众关系更加密切，发现问题和解决问题也更加及时。现在，全乡已消灭了三类耕作区和三类生产队，使各项生产和工作得到全面均衡的发展。
    （4）广大干部和群众在政、社合一后，集体主义思想大大增长，都能从全乡人民的利益出发考虑问题。一个耕作区或生产队有了困难，全乡立刻展开协作，加以帮助。他们说：只有大团结，大协作，才有大跃进。
