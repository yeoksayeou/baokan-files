    Water—Bringing a New Life to the People of Dongliang Mountain
    The entire mountain area is being transformed into terraced fields, underground pipelines are forming a network, farmers are using tap water for cooking and feeding livestock, electric lights for illumination, and cable cars are quickly replacing foot travel up and down the mountains.
    (Our report) This reporter Gu Lei reports: Dongliang Mountain in Wushan County, Gansu Province—a national banner for bringing water up mountains—has begun to advance toward advanced water conservancy and electrification, setting a new example for how to develop and prosper in mountainous areas.
    Although the Dongliang Canal, completed two years ago, basically changed the arid landscape of the Dongliang Mountain area, the following problems remained unresolved: due to the slope of the cultivated land, irrigation still inevitably caused soil erosion; more than 2,800 mu of land on the eight mountain peaks of Dongliang Mountain had not yet been converted into paddy fields; during the dry season, the water volume in the canal was insufficient; many mountain slopes and field ridges were not yet greened; the existing water energy had not been fully utilized; and most irrigation channels were open ditches, unsuitable for mechanized farming. Therefore, under the leadership of the local Party committee, the people of Dongliang Mountain began the construction of advanced water conservancy and electrification.
    In terms of advanced water conservancy, five constructions were carried out. First, open branch canals were replaced with underground pipelines to form an underground pipeline irrigation network, connecting the land into one piece. The method of water diversion is to send water section by section to the terraced fields through buried underground pipelines and reservoirs in the terraced fields. Currently, the construction of underground pipelines for five branch canals has been completed and is already in use. The advantages of this irrigation method are: water does not evaporate, is not restricted by climatic conditions, saves water, does not affect mechanized farming, and deep wells at all levels can adjust the water volume to ensure year-round irrigation. Second, building inverted siphons to bring water to the mountaintops. The method is to build a large reservoir on the first mountaintop upstream of the canal, install a water pump at the foot of the mountain, and pump water up the mountain through pipelines. Then, between the reservoirs on the first and second mountaintops, install inverted siphons with porcelain pipes. In this way, water is drawn to each mountain peak in turn, turning the land on the mountaintops into paddy fields. Currently, the first completed inverted siphon has begun trial operation. Third, trial use of artificial rainfall and development of sprinkler irrigation. The method is to lead water through pipelines into large water buckets or small cement pools in each terraced field, with rubber pipes or water hoses equipped with nozzles connected to the bottom of the water buckets, using the natural pressure of the water to spray water, turning the water into a mist that falls on the ground. This irrigation method has many advantages. In the past, irrigating one mu of land required 40 cubic meters of water, now it only requires 12 cubic meters; in the past, irrigating one mu of land required five to six man-days, now three people can irrigate 35 mu in one day; in the past, small terraced fields could not be irrigated, now water can be sprayed on any piece of land; in the past, branch canals irrigated only the roots of crops, now the entire crop can be irrigated; in the past, using water to flood the land easily caused soil compaction, but now this phenomenon will not occur. Currently, there are 500 sprinklers on the mountain, and it is planned to promote sprinkler irrigation on most of the land. Fourth, fully utilize water energy to establish industries. Currently, a 20-kilowatt hydroelectric power station has been built, as well as factories for flax processing, sawmills, and flour mills. The hydroelectric power station has begun to transmit electricity, and farmers on Dongliang Mountain have turned on electric lights. Fifth, use the pressure of channel water flowing downwards to build tap water systems. Now the tap water project in Baijia Mountain has been completed, and farmers not only use tap water for cooking and feeding livestock, but also use bathrooms and toilets with tap water in newly built houses.
    While utilizing water, the people of Dongliang Mountain boldly thought about the issue of electrification and began to put it into practice. Because the completion of the hydroelectric power station solved the problem of electricity for lighting, they thought of using electricity in other areas as well. The first experiment started with transportation. They are working on building a cable car with rails from the foot of the mountain to the top. This project will be completed before early October, which will reduce the labor of people going up and down the mountain. In the canteen of the Baijia Mountain Cooperative, they have begun to experiment with using electric stoves for cooking. At the same time, Dongliang Mountain Township has planned to gradually realize mechanized farming and to experiment with using electric tractors to cultivate the land. For this reason, the second hydroelectric power station has also started construction.
    The entire Dongliang Mountain will continue to develop industry by fully utilizing water energy and electrical energy. New villages, including residences, clubs, schools, hospitals, cinemas, libraries, public canteens, breeding farms, parks, and other buildings equipped with electricity and tap water, have begun to be built in Baijia Mountain and will be popularized in all villages. According to the people of Dongliang Mountain, they will soon make Dongliang Mountain green, highly water-conserved and electrified, with standardized roads and transportation, and garden-like villages.
    This is the beginning of Dongliang Mountain's march towards great prosperity. Last year, the average grain yield per mu in Dongliang Mountain was 180 jin, and this year it is 800 jin. With the development of water conservancy, next year's grain yield will undoubtedly be higher than this figure.

    水—给东梁山人民带来新生活
    整个山区正改变成梯田，地下管道连成网，农民用自来水做饭喂牲口，用电灯照明，上山下山快有电缆车代步。
    本报讯　记者顾雷报道：全国引水上山的旗帜——甘肃武山县东梁山开始向高级水利化、电气化道路迈进，给怎样繁荣山区树立了新的榜样。
    前年修成的东梁渠引水上山以后，虽然基本上改变了东梁山区的干旱面貌，却有以下问题未获得解决：因耕地有坡度，浇水时仍免不了冲倒土地；东梁山八个山头上的二千八百多亩土地还没有改成水田；枯水期，渠里的水量不足；不少山坡、埂荒还没有绿化；对已有的水能没有充分利用；灌溉渠道多是明沟，不适合于机器耕作。因此，东梁山群众又在当地党委领导下开始了高级水利化、电气化的建设工作。
    在高级水利化方面，进行了五点建设。第一，把明支渠改为地下管道，组成地下管道灌溉网，使土地连成一片。引水的方法是通过埋入地下的管道和梯田里的蓄水池一节一节地向各级梯田送水。现在，已完成五个支渠的地下管道建设，并已开始使用。这种灌溉方法的好处是：水不蒸发，不受气候条件限制，省水，不影响机耕，各级深井可调节水量，保证常年灌溉。第二，建筑导虹吸管，引水上山头。做法是在渠上游的第一山头上修个大的蓄水塘，山下装一台水泵，通过管道把水打到山上。再在第一个和第二个山头的水塘之间，用瓷管装上导虹吸管。这样依次把水引上各个山头，使山头上的土地都变成水田。现在，建成的第一根导虹吸管已开始试水。第三，试用人工造雨，发展喷雾灌溉。方法是用管道把水引到每一块梯田里的大水桶或小水泥池里，水桶底下接上装有喷头的胶皮管或水龙带，利用水的自然压力喷水，使水变雾状落在地里。这种灌溉方法的好处很多。过去浇一亩地用水四十公方，现在只用十二公方，过去浇一亩地用五至六个人工，现在三个人一天可浇三十五亩，过去小块梯田无法灌溉，现在可以到任何一块地里喷水，过去用支渠浇灌只浇庄稼根部，现在可以浇庄稼的全身，过去用引水漫地土地容易板结，而今不会发生这种现象。现在，山上已有喷头五百个，准备在大部分土地上推行喷雾浇。第四，充分利用水能建立工业。现在已建成二十瓩水力发电站一所，以及亚麻加工、锯木、磨面等工厂。水力发电站已开始送电，东梁山上的农民已点上了电灯。第五，利用渠道水向下倾泄的压力建设自来水。现在柏家山的自来水工程已经竣工，农民不但使用自来水做饭、喂牲口，而且在新建设的住宅里使用着有自来水的浴室、厕所。
    东梁山的人民在利用水的同时，大胆地想到了电气化的问题，并且开始实践。由于建成了水力发电站解决了照明用电，从而想到在其他方面也使用电力。第一个试验从交通运输开始。他们正着手建设由山下通到山上的有轨电缆电车。这个工程将在10月上旬前竣工，以后就将减轻人们上山下山的劳动。在柏家山合作社的食堂里，开始试验用电炉做饭。同时，东梁山乡已计划在逐步实现耕作机械化的同时，试验用电力拖拉机耕种地。为此，第二个水力发电站又开始动工了。
    整个东梁山，还将充分利用水能和电能继续发展工业。包括有电气和自来水设备的住宅、俱乐部、学校、医院、电影院、图书馆、公共食堂、饲养场、公园等建筑的新村，已开始在柏家山建设，并将普及各个村庄。照东梁山人民的说法，他们将很快使东梁山绿化、高级水利化和电气化、道路交通标准化、村庄花园化。
    这是东梁山走向大繁荣的开始。去年东梁山粮食平均亩产量一百八十斤，今年是八百斤。随着水利的发展，明年的粮食产量无疑会高于这个数字。
