    Create one thousand-ton iron producing county after another, and a ten-thousand-ton iron producing province, as a gift to National Day!
    Take Four Measures to Mobilize All Positive Factors
    Shandong Strives for Daily Output of 10,000 Tons of Iron
    (Our newspaper, Jinan, 22nd) The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee and a telephone conference of city and prefectural party secretaries in recent days to review and deploy iron and steel production.
    The Provincial Committee pointed out that, as of the 17th, the province's daily pig iron production had risen from over 600 tons on September 4th to 1,175 tons (excluding sponge iron), and had reached 1,437 tons on September 13th. Although the output has more than doubled, it is still far from the September target. The Provincial Committee called on the Party, government, army and people of Shandong to mobilize urgently, fight hard for ten days, fight the first Huaihai Campaign on iron and steel production, and ensure that the daily pig iron production reaches and exceeds 10,000 tons before National Day. It also called for creating several thousand-ton counties, striving to complete the glorious task of producing 200,000 tons of iron and 70,000 tons of steel, and presenting it as a gift to National Day.
    In order to resolutely ensure the success of the iron and steel marshal, the Shandong Provincial Committee has taken several effective measures: (1) Strengthening the leadership of iron and steel production. Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Provincial Committee, has led iron and steel inspection teams to inspect Zibo, Changwei, Qingdao and other regions; in addition to Tan Qilong spending half his time on agriculture, the other secretaries are all focusing on iron and steel. In addition to drawing some people to work with the Provincial Committee's Rural Work Department to take charge of the province's autumn harvest and planting, most of the cadres in the Provincial Committee's General Office have merged with the cadres of the original Provincial Committee's Iron and Steel Office to form a staff headquarters commanding the province's iron and steel production. In addition, departments serving iron and steel production, such as material supply, transportation, production technical guidance, living supply, and labor wages, have been established, relying on relevant departments. (2) Requiring 60% to 70% of the 33,000 blast furnaces that have been built to be put into production as soon as possible, and 60% of them to be in normal production. At the same time, 100,000 blast furnaces should be built quickly, and the experience of Zibo City in using porcelain kilns, brick and tile kilns, and various earthen kilns to smelt iron should be promoted as much as possible. (3) Combining key points with general points. Party committees at all levels must concentrate on ensuring that the key counties with a daily iron output of 1,000 tons achieve their plans as soon as possible, and also ensure that the iron output of counties with ore rises daily and reaches a certain level.
  (4) Strengthening political command, opposing departmentalism, and establishing communist ideology. The Provincial Committee requires all departments to quickly formulate guarantee plans for each department, resolutely mobilize the masses, and organize the 3.6 million troops who have already been put into iron and steel production to fight resolutely for the complete victory of the first Huaihai Campaign of iron and steel production.

    创造一个又一个生铁千吨县万吨省，给国庆节献礼！
    采取四项措施调动一切积极因素
    山东力争日产万吨铁
    本报济南22日电　中共山东省委连日召开常委扩大会议和市、地委书记电话会议，检查布置钢铁生产。
    省委指出，到17日止，全省生铁日产量已经从9月4日的六百多吨，上升到一千一百七十五吨（不包括海绵铁），9月13日曾达到一千四百三十七吨。虽然产量提高一倍多，但是同9月份任务比较起来仍然相差很远。省委号召，山东党政军民必须紧急动员起来，苦战十天，打好钢铁生产上的第一个淮海战役，保证国庆节前生铁日产量达到和超过万吨，并且创造几个千吨县，争取完成生产二十万吨铁、七万吨钢的光荣任务，向国庆节献礼。
    为了坚决保证钢铁元帅升帐，山东省委已经采取几项有效措施：（一）加强钢铁生产的领导。省委第一书记舒同已经率领钢铁检查组，先后到淄博、昌潍、青岛等地区视察；书记处书记除了谭启龙以一半时间抓农业外，其他几人都全力抓钢铁。省委办公厅除抽出一部分人与省委农村工作部一起负责指挥全省秋收秋种以外，其他大部分干部已经同原省委钢铁办公室的干部合并组成指挥全省钢铁生产的参谋部。另外，还分别以有关部门为依托，成立了物资供应、交通运输、生产技术指导、生活供应、劳动工资等为钢铁生产服务的部门。（二）要求已经建成的三万三千座高炉有60％到70％从速投入生产，其中又要有60％正常生产。同时要迅速增建十万座高炉，并要尽力推广淄博市已经试验成功的瓷窑、砖瓦窑以及各种土窑炼铁的经验。（三）重点和一般相结合。各级党委既要集中保证日产千吨铁的重点县早日实现计划，又要使有矿石的县的铁产量逐日上升，都达到一定的水平。
  （四）加强政治挂帅，反对本位主义，树立共产主义思想。省委要求各部门迅速制订各部门的保证计划，坚决发动群众，把已经投入钢铁生产的三百六十万大军很好地组织起来，为钢铁生产的第一个淮海战役的全胜而坚决奋斗。各省、市、自治区生铁生产进度表（单位：吨）附：完成计划比较表
