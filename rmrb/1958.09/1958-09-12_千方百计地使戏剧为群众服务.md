    Make Every Effort to Serve the Masses with Drama
    Wu Xue
    Under the brilliant illumination of the Party Central Committee's General Line, the capital's drama circles, like comrades on the industrial and agricultural fronts and other fronts, are bursting with energy and have presented a brand new situation. The several drama theaters in Beijing used to be subsidized by the state, but this year they not only do not require subsidies, but have also proposed plans to turn over profits to the state. New plays are emerging one after another, and themes reflecting real-life struggles have become the mainstream. Many famous actors have once again stepped out of the theaters, gone to the streets and mines, down to the factories and countryside, and have become one with the masses. Recently, the Beijing People's Art Theater has made further leaps forward and is preparing to stage six new plays reflecting the Great Leap Forward within two months. Here, I will only focus on the Great Leap Forward situation of the China Youth Art Theater in the rectification movement.
    Before the rectification movement, there were many problems in our theater. The more prominent ones were that the banner of literary and artistic thought was not clear enough, and that we emphasized professional work over politics. We inappropriately emphasized the construction of theater art, one-sidedly emphasized improvement, and neglected the task of cooperating with political movements and cooperating with the Party and the state's central work in a certain period to carry out propaganda to the broad masses of workers and peasants, and spent the main force in the theater on large-scale plays. Although we still carried out some touring performances to factories and rural areas every year, the proportion was very small, and we did not pay enough attention to it ideologically. The large-scale plays performed in the theater were dominated by foreign classical plays. Although it accounted for a small proportion of the total number of plays and performances, both the theater leaders and the masses were infatuated with it in their minds, believing that it had high artistic value and was worth pursuing. On the contrary, they adopted a cold and contemptuous attitude towards new creations that reflected modern life, and belittled its role. Some people even once believed that performing foreign classical plays was our direction for improvement, and ridiculed those actors who engaged in scripts that reflected the struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers as third-rate "directional actors." This kind of thinking of emphasizing foreign over Chinese, valuing the past over the present, and improving behind closed doors undoubtedly violates the Party's literary and artistic policy. Another prominent problem was the extravagance and waste in work style. There were too many people, too few performances, large scale, small income, and we only knew to reach out to the state for money. Actors had no plays to perform and often became emotional. The scenery and costumes of the performances were also excessively pursued to be gorgeous, as if the quality of art was to be piled up with money. It took three or four months to half a year, or even a year, to rehearse a play, and the play was not necessarily good.
    After the rectification movement, the ideological awareness of all comrades in the theater has been greatly improved, politics has taken command, and it has been clarified that art must serve politics and serve the cause of socialist construction. Especially inspired by the nationwide Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, we cannot but strive to catch up, and thus many new Great Leap Forward atmospheres have emerged, which are unprecedented.
    In 1957, our theater had a total of 249 people, performed 457 performances, and the state subsidized 300,000 yuan. This year, the number of personnel has been reduced to 124, and it is planned to perform 1,000 performances throughout the year, not only to achieve self-sufficiency, but also to turn over a surplus of 100,000 yuan to the state, and to complete 415 large and small creations. With the efforts of all comrades to go all out and strive for the top, we have now smoothly completed the plan for the first half of the year. From January to July, we rehearsed and performed a total of 88 large and small plays, performed 634 performances, with more than 580,000 audiences, exceeding the number of performances in the past year, and a surplus of 56,000 yuan. We have also completed 248 large and small script creations.
    When celebrating the 37th anniversary of the Party on July 1, in order to present gifts to the Party, all comrades in the theater, in addition to spending less than ten days, rushing to produce "Ode to the Ming Tombs Reservoir" by writing one scene after another with Comrade Tian Han, and he wrote and we rehearsed, we also resolved to work harder and ensure that we complete the annual plan two months ahead of schedule, and strive to start the work in 1959 in November. The entire theater is now working hard for this.
    The changes in the theater's literary and artistic thinking are also very great. The first is reflected in the emphasis on new plays that reflect modern life. 100% of the 88 large and small plays performed in the first half of the year are modern life themes, not only closely integrated with the pulse of the times, but also the main artistic creators have enthusiastically invested in the creation of new plays. This was impossible before the rectification movement. Therefore, in the case of the national Great Leap Forward, everyone is very busy, still maintain an average attendance rate of 88% in the first half of the year, which is a good answer to those who worry that the masses do not like to watch modern plays. At the beginning, when we were creating in order to complete the number of scripts, we racked our brains and thought of many bizarre and strange themes from ancient times to the present, but we couldn't write a few, and it was difficult to use them. After we clarified the writing policy of cooperating with political tasks and the current central work, the performance of the theater and the streets are both important, the large and small plays are both important, and the drama and small forms (Yangko, live reporting, fast talk, etc.) are both important. In order to promote the general line, dozens of works appeared after a night of hard work. Stage workers also participated in writing. Li Zhang and Yu Zhen, the adapters of "Dedicate Everything to the Party," are two young people who have never written a play. In this way, not only has the past script shortage been changed, greatly enriching the content of theater art, but also making the theater truly a communist school and a vanguard of the times.
    In the rehearsal work, there are also many "miracles" that have never been seen before, nor dared to think about. For example, the speed of rehearsing plays has been greatly accelerated. In order to quickly reflect reality and cooperate with political tasks for propaganda, rehearsing plays is calculated in hours. When protesting against the US and British aggression against the Middle East and cheering the communiqué of the Sino-Soviet talks, we went to the streets to perform new programs in less than three hours. It took only 75 hours to rehearse "Red Storm," and 62 hours to rehearse "Liu Jiemei," and then 60 hours to rehearse "Dedicate Everything to the Party," and the quality gradually improved.
    It is the same in terms of rehearsal and performance. The actors once performed five performances in one day, working for 16 hours, three street propaganda performances in the morning, and two theater performances in the afternoon and evening. In order to reduce personnel and give full play to everyone's potential and energy, when we performed "Ode to the Ming Tombs Reservoir," 50 actors (including administrative staff and stage workers, only 25 real actors) played 185 roles. One comrade played seven characters, changed clothes eight times, and the performance of the entire play was as tense as a battlefield. In the past, it took at least a month to make a set of scenery. Now, stage workers can complete the design, material selection, production, and move it to the stage in just a few days. In the past, it cost thousands and thousands of dollars, but now it only costs hundreds of dollars. "Red Storm" only cost 70 yuan. Now, not only is it guaranteed to perform on time, but also there are many inventions and creations. For example, the "earth" turntable created to express the labor scene in the performance of "Ode to the Ming Tombs Reservoir" is light, flexible, economical, and practical, and can be moved around for performances. Painting huge backgrounds is changed to dyeing, from 100 yuan to only 4 yuan, and it is not afraid of folding, light in weight, does not fade, and can express national style. The semiconductor amplifier trial-produced by the effects group can also be used without power when performing in rural areas. In order to cooperate with the performance, the administrative staff of the theater can be used everywhere and arrive whenever they are called. This communist cooperation has changed the past atmosphere of mutual disrespect, mutual indifference, and mutual disobedience, and a happy and family-like situation has emerged. The slogan of everyone is "No distinction between jobs, common labor, everyone must become a versatile all-rounder with expertise in several fields."
    In terms of performance methods, we have also changed our past practices, walked out of the theater, went to factories and rural areas to go deep into the workers and peasants, and sent the play to their doorsteps. The composition of the audience has changed, with workers, peasants and soldiers accounting for more than 70%. We divided the 65 actors of the entire theater into three teams to perform at the same time. Two teams took turns to tour in other places and suburbs, sending the play to the pit mouths and fields, and promptly compiled and performed the model deeds of the local masses, which were warmly welcomed. After watching our performances, the workers of the Ma Guofu and Zhao Guoqing advanced groups of the Datong Coal Mine Tongjialiang Mine, in order to answer the enthusiasm of the actors, worked hard overnight to create a national record of raising the bottom of the stone 10 meters, and an advanced achievement of semi-coal and rock tunneling into the alley 11.1 meters, and reported the good news to the actors the next morning. The enthusiasm of the workers and the masses in turn educated the actors, and they must better serve the workers and peasants. Our slogan is: Do everything possible to serve the audience, we will perform whatever the audience wants to watch, we will send it to wherever they want to watch, and we will perform whenever they want to watch.
    Now, the service attitude of the theater has also changed. In order to facilitate the audience, not only can they buy tickets by phone and deliver tickets to their doorsteps, but also temporary nurseries have been established, and the slogan of "Treating the audience as welcoming distinguished guests" has been put forward.
    The actors go to factories and rural areas to participate in labor with the masses, learn from the workers and peasants, transform their thinking, and also engage in counseling work, absorb active members of drama activities and participate in the performance with us. Our slogan in this regard is "Go wherever we go, publicize wherever we go, counsel wherever we go, and learn wherever we go."
    Recently, one of our teams has gone to Fujian to perform for the masses on the coastal defense line. The two teams staying in the capital, in addition to maintaining the theater performance, in order to welcome the National Day, we have cooperated with the Beijing Film Studio and are preparing to spend a month and a half to make "Ode to the Ming Tombs Reservoir" into a five-color film as a gift for "October 1st." At the same time, we have accepted the task and participated in the development of mass cultural work in the Mentougou mining area. We are determined to study hard, work hard, and treat Mentougou as our home under the leadership of the district party committee, and truly be a red propagandist and an ordinary worker.
    Of course, the Great Leap Forward of the theater is only a beginning, there are still many problems and many shortcomings.
    We will confidently, under the leadership of the Party, in accordance with the law of artistic creation of more, faster, better, and more economical, further go deep into reality, connect with the masses, transform our thinking, create better dramas more and more timely, serve the socialist construction of the motherland, and strive to build the theater into a truly communist-style red theater in a very short period of time.

    千方百计地使戏剧为群众服务
    吴雪
    在党中央总路线的光辉照耀下，首都话剧界也和工农业，以及其他战线上的同志们一样，干劲冲天，出现了崭新的局面。北京的几个话剧院过去都是受国家补贴的，今年不仅不要补贴，而且都提出了上缴盈余的计划，新剧目层出不穷，反映现实斗争的题材形成了主流。许多著名的演员又重新走出了剧场，上街上矿，下厂下乡，同群众打成一片。最近北京人民艺术剧院更是跃进再跃进，准备在两个月内演出六个反映跃进的新剧目。这里我只着重谈谈中国青年艺术剧院在整风运动中的跃进情况。
    整风以前，我们剧院是存在不少问题的。比较突出的是在文艺思想上旗帜不鲜明，重业务轻政治。不适当地强调建设剧场艺术，片面地强调提高，忽视配合政治运动，配合党和国家某一时期中心工作向广大工农群众进行宣传的任务，把主要力量花在剧场里搞大戏。虽然每年也还做些下厂下乡的巡回演出活动，但比重很小，思想上重视不够。在剧场里搞的大戏，又是外国古典戏占重要地位。尽管它占演出的全部剧目和场次的比例不大，但是无论剧院领导或群众都在思想上迷恋它，认为它艺术价值高，有搞头。相反地对表现现代生活的新创作，则采取冷淡轻视的态度，贬低它的作用。甚至有一些人曾经认为演外国古典戏是我们提高的方向，讽刺那些搞反映工农兵斗争生活剧本的演员是第三等的“方向演员”。这种重外轻中，厚古薄今，关门提高的思想无疑是违背党的文艺方针的。另一个突出的问题是作风上的铺张浪费。人员多，演出少，排场大，收入小，就知道伸手向国家要钱。演员没有戏演，经常闹情绪。演出的布景服装又过多地追求华丽，好像艺术质量是要用钱来堆的。一个戏要排三、四个月到半年，甚至一年的时间，戏还不一定好。
    经过整风，全院同志的思想觉悟大大提高，政治挂了帅，明确了艺术必须为政治服务，为社会主义建设事业服务。特别是受到全国工农业生产大跃进的鼓舞，我们不能不努力赶上去，于是出现了许多跃进新气象，都是前所未有的。
    1957年我院全院二百四十九人，演出四百五十七场，国家补贴了三十万元。今年编制人数减到一百二十四人，计划全年演出一千场，不仅要做到自给自足，而且还要向国家上缴盈余十万元，并要完成大小创作四百一十五个。在全体同志鼓足干劲力争上游的努力下，现在已顺利地完成了上半年计划，1至7月份共排演、演出了大小剧目八十八个，演出了六百三十四场，观众五十八万多人次，超过了去年一年的演出数字，并且盈余五万六千元。还完成大小剧本创作二百四十八个。
    当7月1日党的三十七周年纪念时，全院同志为向党献礼，除花了不到十天的时间，在田汉同志写一幕我们排一幕，他写成我们排成的办法赶排出“十三陵水库畅想曲”外，并决心再加把劲，保证提前两个月完成全年计划，争取11月开始1959年的工作，现在全院正为此苦战。
    剧院在文艺思想上的变化也是很大的，首先表现在对反映现代生活的新剧目的重视，上半年演出的八十八个大小剧目，百分之百都是现代生活题材，不但紧密地和时代脉搏结合，而且主要的艺术创作人员也都热情地投入新剧目的创作中，这是整风以前无论如何也办不到的。因此在全国大跃进、人人都忙得不得了的情况下，仍然保持半年平均上座率88％，这对那些担心群众不爱看现代剧目的人，是一个很好的回答。当初在我们为了完成剧本数字进行创作的时候，挖空心思，上下古今想了许多离奇古怪的题材，也写不出几个，而且很难合用。在我们明确了配合政治任务和当前中心工作的写作方针、演出上的剧场街头并举、大剧小剧并举、话剧与小形式（秧歌、活报、快板等）并举的做法，为了宣传总路线，一夜苦战便出现几十个作品。舞台工作人员也参加写作。“把一切献给党”的改编者李章、于真同志就是两个从未写过戏的青年。这样，不仅一改过去剧本荒的局面，大大丰富了剧场艺术的内容，而且使剧院真正成为共产主义的学校，时代的尖兵。
    在排演工作中，也出现许多过去所没有，也不敢想的“奇迹”，例如排戏的速度大大加快，为了迅速地反映现实，配合政治任务进行宣传，排戏都以小时计算，在抗议美英侵略中东、欢呼中苏会谈公报时，我们都是不到三小时就上街演出新节目了。就是排“红色风暴”也只用了七十五个小时，排“刘介梅”又缩短到六十二个小时，后来又用六十小时排出“把一切献给党”，而且质量逐步有所提高。
    排演方面这样，演出方面也这样，演员们曾经一天演出过五场，工作到十六小时，上午三场街头宣传，下午和晚上两场剧场演出，为了减少人员，发挥每个人的潜力和干劲，我们在演出“十三陵水库畅想曲”一剧时，五十个演员（包括行政人员和舞台工作人员，真正的演员只二十五个），担任了一百八十五个角色，有一个同志竟演了七个人物，换八次服装，整个戏的演出真如战场一样的紧张。过去，做一堂布景最少得一个月时间，现在舞台工作人员只用几天的时间，就能从设计、选料到制作完成搬上舞台；过去要用上千上万的钱，现在只用几百元，“红色风暴”只用了七十元。现在不仅保证按时演出，并有许多发明创造，如演出“十三陵水库畅想曲”，为了表现劳动场景创造的“土”转台，轻便灵活，省钱实用，可以到处移动演出。绘巨幅背景改用染色来画，从一百元减到只花四元，而且不怕拆叠，分量很轻，又不掉色，且能表现民族风格。效果组试制成的半导体扩大器，在农村流动演出时无电源也能使用。剧院行政管理人员为了配合演出，做到到处听用，随唤随到，这种共产主义协作一改过去互不尊重、互不关心、互不服气的风气，出现了心情舒畅、亲如家人的局面。大家的口号是“不分工种共同劳动，每个人都要成为一专几能的多面手”。
    在演出方式上，我们也改变了过去的作法，走出剧场，下厂下乡深入工农，把戏送上门去。观众的成份改变了，工农兵占70％以上。我们把全院六十五个演员分成三个队同时演出，有两个队轮流在外地和郊区巡回演出，把戏送到矿坑口和农田间，并及时编排当地群众自己的模范事迹演出，受到热烈欢迎。大同煤矿同家梁矿的马国富、赵国清两个先进小组的工人同志看了我们的演出后，为了回答演员的热情盛意，连夜努力创造了一个小班起石底十公尺的全国最高纪录，和半煤岩掘进一次成巷十一点一公尺的先进成绩，并在第二天清早来向演员报喜。工人群众的这种干劲反过来教育了演员，一定要更好地为工农群众服务。我们提出的口号是：千方百计为观众服务，观众愿意看什么我们就演什么，愿意在什么地方看就送到什么地方去，愿意什么时候看就什么时候演。
    现在，剧场的服务态度也变了，为了便利观众，不仅可以电话买票，送票上门，而且成立了临时托儿站等，提出“待观众如迎贵宾”的口号。
    演员们下厂下乡和群众一道参加劳动，向工农学习，改造思想，同时也搞辅导工作，吸收戏剧活动积极分子和我们一道参加演出，我们在这方面的口号是“走到哪里宣传到哪里，走到哪里辅导到哪里，走到哪里学习到哪里”。
    最近我们一个队已去福建为海防线上的群众演出，留在首都的两个队，除了维持剧场演出外，为了迎接国庆，我们已与北京电影制片厂合作，准备用一个半月的时间，把“十三陵水库畅想曲”拍成一部五彩电影作为“十·一”的献礼。同时，我们已经接受了任务，参加开展门头沟矿区的群众文化工作。我们有决心在区委的领导下，好好学习，好好工作，把门头沟当成我们的家，真正做一个红色的宣传员，一个普通劳动者。
    当然，剧院的跃进，还仅是一个开端，问题还多，缺点也不少。
    我们将满怀信心地在党的领导下，根据多快好省的艺术创作规律，进一步深入实际，联系群众，改造思想，更多更及时地创造更好的戏剧，为祖国的社会主义建设服务，为争取在很短的时间内，把剧院建设成一个真正具有共产主义风格的红色剧院而斗争。
