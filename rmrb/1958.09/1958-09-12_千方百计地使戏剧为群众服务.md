    Make Every Effort to Serve the Masses with Drama
    Wu Xue
    Under the brilliant illumination of the Party Central Committee's General Line, the capital's drama circles, like comrades on the industrial and agricultural fronts and other fronts, are bursting with energy and have presented a brand new situation. The several drama theaters in Beijing used to be subsidized by the state, but this year they not only do not require subsidies, but have also proposed plans to turn over profits to the state. New plays are emerging one after another, and themes reflecting real-life struggles have become the mainstream. Many famous actors have once again stepped out of the theaters, gone to the streets and mines, down to the factories and countryside, and have become one with the masses. Recently, the Beijing People's Art Theater has made further leaps forward and is preparing to stage six new plays reflecting the Great Leap Forward within two months. Here, I will only focus on the Great Leap Forward situation of the China Youth Art Theater in the rectification movement.
    Before the rectification movement, there were many problems in our theater. The more prominent ones were that the banner of literary and artistic thought was not clear enough, and that we emphasized professional work over politics. We inappropriately emphasized the construction of theater art, one-sidedly emphasized improvement, and neglected the task of cooperating with political movements and cooperating with the Party and the state's central work in a certain period to carry out propaganda to the broad masses of workers and peasants, and spent the main force in the theater on large-scale plays. Although we still carried out some touring performances to factories and rural areas every year, the proportion was very small, and we did not pay enough attention to it ideologically. The large-scale plays performed in the theater were dominated by foreign classical plays. Although it accounted for a small proportion of the total number of plays and performances, both the theater leaders and the masses were infatuated with it in their minds, believing that it had high artistic value and was worth pursuing. On the contrary, they adopted a cold and contemptuous attitude towards new creations that reflected modern life, and belittled its role. Some people even once believed that performing foreign classical plays was our direction for improvement, and ridiculed those actors who engaged in scripts that reflected the struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers as third-rate "directional actors." This kind of thinking of emphasizing foreign over Chinese, valuing the past over the present, and improving behind closed doors undoubtedly violates the Party's literary and artistic policy. Another prominent problem was the extravagance and waste in work style. There were too many people, too few performances, large scale, small income, and we only knew to reach out to the state for money. Actors had no plays to perform and often became emotional. The scenery and costumes of the performances were also excessively pursued to be gorgeous, as if the quality of art was to be piled up with money. It took three or four months to half a year, or even a year, to rehearse a play, and the play was not necessarily good.
    After the rectification movement, the ideological awareness of all comrades in the theater has been greatly improved, politics has taken command, and it has been clarified that art must serve politics and serve the cause of socialist construction. Especially inspired by the nationwide Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, we cannot but strive to catch up, and thus many new Great Leap Forward atmospheres have emerged, which are unprecedented.
    In 1957, our theater had a total of 249 people, performed 457 performances, and the state subsidized 300,000 yuan. This year, the number of personnel has been reduced to 124, and it is planned to perform 1,000 performances throughout the year, not only to achieve self-sufficiency, but also to turn over a surplus of 100,000 yuan to the state, and to complete 415 large and small creations. With the efforts of all comrades to go all out and strive for the top, we have now smoothly completed the plan for the first half of the year. From January to July, we rehearsed and performed a total of 88 large and small plays, performed 634 performances, with more than 580,000 audiences, exceeding the number of performances in the past year, and a surplus of 56,000 yuan. We have also completed 248 large and small script creations.
    When celebrating the 37th anniversary of the Party on July 1, in order to present gifts to the Party, all comrades in the theater, in addition to spending less than ten days, rushing to produce "Ode to the Ming Tombs Reservoir" by writing one scene after another with Comrade Tian Han, and he wrote and we rehearsed, we also resolved to work harder and ensure that we complete the annual plan two months ahead of schedule, and strive to start the work in 1959 in November. The entire theater is now working hard for this.
    The changes in the theater's literary and artistic thinking are also very great. The first is reflected in the emphasis on new plays that reflect modern life. 100% of the 88 large and small plays performed in the first half of the year are modern life themes, not only closely integrated with the pulse of the times, but also the main artistic creators have enthusiastically invested in the creation of new plays. This was impossible before the rectification movement. Therefore, in the case of the national Great Leap Forward, everyone is very busy, still maintain an average attendance rate of 88% in the first half of the year, which is a good answer to those who worry that the masses do not like to watch modern plays. At the beginning, when we were creating in order to complete the number of scripts, we racked our brains and thought of many bizarre and strange themes from ancient times to the present, but we couldn't write a few, and it was difficult to use them. After we clarified the writing policy of cooperating with political tasks and the current central work, the performance of the theater and the streets are both important, the large and small plays are both important, and the drama and small forms (Yangko, live reporting, fast talk, etc.) are both important. In order to promote the general line, dozens of works appeared after a night of hard work. Stage workers also participated in writing. Li Zhang and Yu Zhen, the adapters of "Dedicate Everything to the Party," are two young people who have never written a play. In this way, not only has the past script shortage been changed, greatly enriching the content of theater art, but also making the theater truly a communist school and a vanguard of the times.
    In the rehearsal work, there are also many "miracles" that have never been seen before, nor dared to think about. For example, the speed of rehearsing plays has been greatly accelerated. In order to quickly reflect reality and cooperate with political tasks for propaganda, rehearsing plays is calculated in hours. When protesting against the US and British aggression against the Middle East and cheering the communiqu√© of the Sino-Soviet talks, we went to the streets to perform new programs in less than three hours. It took only 75 hours to rehearse "Red Storm," and 62 hours to rehearse "Liu Jiemei," and then 60 hours to rehearse "Dedicate Everything to the Party," and the quality gradually improved.
    It is the same in terms of rehearsal and performance. The actors once performed five performances in one day, working for 16 hours, three street propaganda performances in the morning, and two theater performances in the afternoon and evening. In order to reduce personnel and give full play to everyone's potential and energy, when we performed "Ode to the Ming Tombs Reservoir," 50 actors (including administrative staff and stage workers, only 25 real actors) played 185 roles. One comrade played seven characters, changed clothes eight times, and the performance of the entire play was as tense as a battlefield. In the past, it took at least a month to make a set of scenery. Now, stage workers can complete the design, material selection, production, and move it to the stage in just a few days. In the past, it cost thousands and thousands of dollars, but now it only costs hundreds of dollars. "Red Storm" only cost 70 yuan. Now, not only is it guaranteed to perform on time, but also there are many inventions and creations. For example, the "earth" turntable created to express the labor scene in the performance of "Ode to the Ming Tombs Reservoir" is light, flexible, economical, and practical, and can be moved around for performances. Painting huge backgrounds is changed to dyeing, from 100 yuan to only 4 yuan, and it is not afraid of folding, light in weight, does not fade, and can express national style. The semiconductor amplifier trial-produced by the effects group can also be used without power when performing in rural areas. In order to cooperate with the performance, the administrative staff of the theater can be used everywhere and arrive whenever they are called. This communist cooperation has changed the past atmosphere of mutual disrespect, mutual indifference, and mutual disobedience, and a happy and family-like situation has emerged. The slogan of everyone is "No distinction between jobs, common labor, everyone must become a versatile all-rounder with expertise in several fields."
    In terms of performance methods, we have also changed our past practices, walked out of the theater, went to factories and rural areas to go deep into the workers and peasants, and sent the play to their doorsteps. The composition of the audience has changed, with workers, peasants and soldiers accounting for more than 70%. We divided the 65 actors of the entire theater into three teams to perform at the same time. Two teams took turns to tour in other places and suburbs, sending the play to the pit mouths and fields, and promptly compiled and performed the model deeds of the local masses, which were warmly welcomed. After watching our performances, the workers of the Ma Guofu and Zhao Guoqing advanced groups of the Datong Coal Mine Tongjialiang Mine, in order to answer the enthusiasm of the actors, worked hard overnight to create a national record of raising the bottom of the stone 10 meters, and an advanced achievement of semi-coal and rock tunneling into the alley 11.1 meters, and reported the good news to the actors the next morning. The enthusiasm of the workers and the masses in turn educated the actors, and they must better serve the workers and peasants. Our slogan is: Do everything possible to serve the audience, we will perform whatever the audience wants to watch, we will send it to wherever they want to watch, and we will perform whenever they want to watch.
    Now, the service attitude of the theater has also changed. In order to facilitate the audience, not only can they buy tickets by phone and deliver tickets to their doorsteps, but also temporary nurseries have been established, and the slogan of "Treating the audience as welcoming distinguished guests" has been put forward.
    The actors go to factories and rural areas to participate in labor with the masses, learn from the workers and peasants, transform their thinking, and also engage in counseling work, absorb active members of drama activities and participate in the performance with us. Our slogan in this regard is "Go wherever we go, publicize wherever we go, counsel wherever we go, and learn wherever we go."
    Recently, one of our teams has gone to Fujian to perform for the masses on the coastal defense line. The two teams staying in the capital, in addition to maintaining the theater performance, in order to welcome the National Day, we have cooperated with the Beijing Film Studio and are preparing to spend a month and a half to make "Ode to the Ming Tombs Reservoir" into a five-color film as a gift for "October 1st." At the same time, we have accepted the task and participated in the development of mass cultural work in the Mentougou mining area. We are determined to study hard, work hard, and treat Mentougou as our home under the leadership of the district party committee, and truly be a red propagandist and an ordinary worker.
    Of course, the Great Leap Forward of the theater is only a beginning, there are still many problems and many shortcomings.
    We will confidently, under the leadership of the Party, in accordance with the law of artistic creation of more, faster, better, and more economical, further go deep into reality, connect with the masses, transform our thinking, create better dramas more and more timely, serve the socialist construction of the motherland, and strive to build the theater into a truly communist-style red theater in a very short period of time.
