Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory and Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory
Regularly Compare Enthusiasm, Promoting Everyone to Strive for the Top
Guaranteeing Complete Victory in the Rectification Movement and Launching a New Upsurge in Production

    This newspaper's Chongqing dispatch, by reporter Hu Mingjun: The Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory's workers adopted the method of regularly comparing enthusiasm to consolidate the results of the rectification, making full airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters routine, and making political and ideological work mass-based. After using this method, the vast majority of workers at the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory were full of enthusiasm and strived to be the best.

    After the end of the rectification, some workers in this factory adopted the method of comparing enthusiasm in July, and achieved great results in their thinking and work. This method was quickly and widely promoted among all workers, Party and Youth League organizations, and between units throughout the factory. Each unit formulated comparison conditions and conducted comparisons approximately every half month. Generally, the quality of completing production tasks was taken as the primary condition for comparison, and conditions such as good learning and research, good unity and mutual assistance, good obedience to the organization, and good safety and hygiene were also stipulated. The comparison categories were generally divided into three categories: full of enthusiasm, general enthusiasm, and insufficient enthusiasm.

    Around the activity of comparing enthusiasm, many units in this factory regularly and frequently launched activities such as full airing of views, great debates, posting big-character posters, and carrying out criticism and praise. Individuals and units with full of enthusiasm were praised, while individuals and units in the middle and lower reaches were criticized. The masses generally reflected, "This method really works," which not only improved thinking, but also promoted work. When the 31st workshop recently compared enthusiasm, the masses posted hundreds of big-character posters criticizing some leaders and units for being content with the middle reaches and being conservative and backward. The assembly section of this workshop was manually operated. The cadres and some workers of the section had always believed that assembly was manual work, and it was impossible to use machinery. They simply worked according to conventional methods, and the work efficiency was very low. Recently, the entire workshop carried out an activity of comparing enthusiasm, and the assembly section was rated as a category with insufficient enthusiasm. The workers in this section disagreed. Therefore, a heated debate was launched at the debate meeting and on big-character posters. Many workers in the workshop unanimously criticized the assembly section for not liberating their minds well and lacking a style of bold experimentation and bold creation, thereby helping the assembly section workers improve their ideological understanding. At present, all workers in the section have changed five operating procedures to mechanical operations, and the work efficiency has increased by more than doubled. The remaining six operating procedures are also being prepared to be changed to mechanical operations. In this way, this section was quickly rated as a section full of enthusiasm and was praised by the workshop leaders and the masses.

    Through the activity of comparing enthusiasm for building socialism, the Chongqing Machine Tool Factory has formed a new atmosphere in which everyone talks about politics and thinking, and everyone strives to be the best. The number of people full of enthusiasm is increasing, and the number of people in the middle and lower reaches is greatly reduced. According to a survey of four workshops, including the 35th workshop, the 31st workshop, the 32nd workshop, and the 37th workshop, in the first comparison of enthusiasm, the workers in these workshops rated as full of enthusiasm accounted for 57.45%, those with general enthusiasm accounted for 35.7%, and those with insufficient enthusiasm accounted for 6.85%; in the second comparison, the number of people with full of enthusiasm had risen to 69.85%, the number of people with general enthusiasm had dropped to 26.98%, and the number of people with insufficient enthusiasm had decreased to 3.17%.

    Since the comparison of enthusiasm is aimed at the specific thoughts and work of people and units, and the masses jointly carry out praise and criticism, it truly makes political and ideological work mass-based, more in-depth and meticulous, and has better results.

    This newspaper reports that the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory launched a mass appraisal campaign of inserting red flags and pulling out white flags in the fourth stage of the rectification movement, further implementing the spirit of the General Line, ensuring the complete victory of the rectification movement, and launching a new upsurge in production.

    The appraisal campaign was launched on the basis of a comprehensive review of the work. The factory systematically summarized the great gains and experiences of the rectification movement over the past year. During the rectification, all employees of the factory reaped a double harvest of ideological and production leaps. The factory's planned total output value this year increased by two times compared with last year. Thirteen new products have been successfully trial-produced, and some products have reached international levels. 47% of the factory's employees have high political awareness, dare to think and act, and are already in the upper reaches or are striving to be in the upper reaches in production and work. However, more than 46% of the people are still following the crowd; and there are still over 6% whose thinking is backward and who are content with being in the lower reaches.

    The factory's Party committee analyzed the reasons why some employees were still content with being in the middle and lower reaches. Among the cadres, the main reason was that their thinking had not been liberated, especially after several production leaps, new conservative thoughts had re-emerged. Some believed that the targets had been raised a lot compared with last year; some had pride and mistakenly regarded the middle reaches as the upper reaches. Among the workers, the main reason was that there was still individualism. Some workers still had the idea of working to earn money, and some emphasized personal interests and were not at ease in their work. Based on this situation, the Party committee proposed to check the rectification with the spirit of the General Line, check the production, and launch a mass appraisal campaign of inserting red flags and pulling out white flags among all employees of the factory, so that the entire factory can leap further.

    In order to ensure the smooth progress of the appraisal, the leadership synthesized the opinions put forward by the employees and formulated the appraisal standards. In production units such as workshops, sections, and groups, they compared political leadership, compared the speed of leaping forward and the quality of completion of targets, compared technological revolution, and compared collaboration. In the departments they compared political leadership, compared business reform, compared service to workshop production, and compared collaboration. Based on the above indicators, the masses were widely mobilized to fully air their views and have great debates. At the beginning, the leading cadres took the lead in making checks, affirming achievements, criticizing shortcomings, and focusing on criticizing the right-leaning conservative ideas of being content with the middle reaches. Then the employees set off a new upsurge of big-character posters, with more than 3,000 posters posted throughout the factory within a few days. When evaluating the red flags, in order to fully develop democracy and overcome subjectivism, the method of extensive mass discussion and debate on different opinions was adopted.

    Through the appraisal, a heat tide of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced appeared in the factory, and many backward units demanded to pull out the white flags and insert the red flags. On the basis of the widespread increase in the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees, the leadership systematically guided everyone's enthusiasm to a production upsurge centered on the technical revolution in a planned manner.

### 重庆建设机床厂和北京光华木材厂  经常评比干劲  促使人人争上游　保证整风运动全胜  掀起新的生产高潮

　　重庆建设机床厂和北京光华木材厂
　　经常评比干劲  促使人人争上游
　　保证整风运动全胜  掀起新的生产高潮
    本报重庆讯　记者胡明俊报道：重庆建设机床厂职工采用经常评比干劲的办法，巩固整风成果，使大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报经常化，政治思想工作群众化。运用这个办法以后，重庆建设机床厂职工大部干劲十足，力争上游。
    整风结束以后，这个厂的部分职工在7月份采用了评比干劲的办法，思想上、工作上收效都很大。这个办法很快就在全厂职工中、党团组织中以及单位和单位之间普遍推行起来。各单位都订出了评比条件，半月左右评比一次。一般都把完成生产任务好坏作为评比的首要条件，同时还规定了学习钻研好、团结互助好、服从组织好、安全卫生好等条件。评比类别一般分为干劲十足、干劲一般和干劲不足三类。
    围绕着评比干劲活动，这个厂的许多单位定期地、经常性地展开了大鸣大放、大争大辩、贴大字报和开展批评表扬等活动。干劲十足的个人和单位受到了表扬，安居中、下游的个人和单位受到了批评。群众普遍反映，“这个办法真管事”，既提高了思想，又推动了工作。三十一车间在最近评比干劲时，群众贴出了几百张大字报，批评一些领导人和单位安居中游、保守落后。这个车间的装配工段是手工操作，工段的干部和一些工人一直认为装配是手工活，无法使用机械，只是按常规干活，工作效率很低。最近全车间进行了评比干劲活动，把装配工段评为干劲不足一类，这个工段的职工不同意。于是，在辩论会上、大字报上展开了热烈的争辩。车间许多职工一致批评装配工段没有很好解放思想，缺乏大胆尝试、大胆创造的风格，从而帮助装配工段职工提高了思想认识。目前全工段职工已把五道操作工序改为机械操作，工效提高了一倍以上，其余六道工序也正在着手改为机械操作。这样，这个工段很快就被评为干劲十足的工段，受到车间领导和群众的表扬。
    通过评比建设社会主义的干劲的活动，重庆机床厂已经形成了人人谈政治、谈思想，个个力争上游的新风气，干劲十足的人愈来愈多，安居中、下游的人大为减少。据三十五车间、三十一车间、三十二车间、三十七车间等四个车间的调查，在第一次评比干劲时，这些车间的工人中，评为干劲十足的占57.45％，干劲一般的占35.7％，干劲不足的占6.85％；在第二次评比时，干劲十足的人已上升到69.85％，干劲一般的人下降到26.98％，干劲不足的人减少到3.17％。
    由于评比干劲是针对着具体的人和单位的思想和工作，由群众一齐来进行表扬和批评，因此，使政治思想工作真正做到群众化，做到更加深透细致，效果更好。
    本报讯　北京市光华木材厂在整风第四阶段开展了插红旗、拔白旗的群众性评比运动，进一步贯彻了总路线精神，保证了整风运动的全胜，并且掀起了新的生产高潮。
    评比运动是在全面检查工作的基础上开展起来的。这个厂系统地总结了一年来整风运动的巨大收获和经验，在整风中全厂职工获得了思想和生产双跃进的丰收，全厂今年计划总产值比去年提高两倍，已试制成功新产品十三种，有些产品已达到国际水平。全厂已有47％的职工，政治觉悟高，敢想敢干，在生产和工作上已居上游或正在力争上游。但是，还有46％以上的人是随大流的；思想落后，安于下游的也还有6％强。
    工厂党委会分析了有些职工仍然安居中游和下游的原因，在干部中主要是思想还没有解放，特别是经过几次生产大跃进以后，新的保守思想又抬头，认为指标比去年提高了不少；有的有骄傲情绪，误把中游作上游。在工人中主要是还有个人主义，有的工人还有干活为了挣钱的思想，有的强调个人兴趣，工作不安心。根据这种情况，党委提出了以总路线精神检查整风，检查生产，在全厂职工中掀起一个插红旗、拔白旗的群众评比运动，使全厂再跃进一步。
    为了评比顺利进行，领导上综合了职工提出的意见，制订了评比标准，在车间、工段、小组等生产单位，比政治挂帅，比指标跃进得快、完成得好，比技术革命，比协作。在科室单位比政治挂帅，比业务改革，比为车间生产服务，比协作。根据以上指标，广泛发动群众，大鸣大放大辩论。开始时，领导干部带头作了检查，肯定成绩、批判缺点，着重批判了安于中游的右倾保守思想。接着职工们掀起了一个大字报的新高潮，几天之内全厂贴出了三千多张。评红旗时，为了充分发扬民主、克服主观主义，采用群众广泛讨论，不同意见开展辩论的办法。
    通过评比，全厂出现了一个学先进赶先进的热潮，许多落后单位要求拔白旗插红旗。在广大职工革命干劲普遍提高的基础上，领导上有计划地把大家的积极性引导到以技术革命为中心的生产高潮上来。
