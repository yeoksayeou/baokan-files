The instructions from the CPC Central Committee on Intensive Cultivation and Soil Improvement
August 29, 1958

(1) The great leap forward in agricultural production over the past year, with the continuous emergence of high-yield “satellite” crops, fully proves that intensive cultivation is the central technical measure for increasing agricultural production. Among "water, fertilizer, soil, seed, and density," the center is soil, which means intensive cultivation. Because, first, intensive cultivation can thicken the loose soil layer. While implementing intensive cultivation, layered fertilization should be carried out, especially organic fertilizers such as manure and green manure, to promote the ripening of the deep subsoil and increase the granular structure of the soil. Each granule is a small reservoir. Countless such small reservoirs in the thick soil layer greatly increase the soil's ability to retain water and resist drought. Second, the nutrients contained in organic matter in the soil cannot be directly absorbed by plants. They must be converted into mineral oxides and dissolved in water to be absorbed by plants. This decomposition of organic matter is mainly aerobic decomposition. Therefore, the soil must have both water and air. Water and air are mutually exclusive in the same space. The granular structure of the soil precisely solves this contradiction. The granule itself is a small reservoir, and the gaps between the granules form corridors for air. This is conducive to the decomposition of organic matter in the soil, and the granules become small fertilizer reservoirs. Without intensive cultivation, even if there is more water and fertilizer, they cannot be fully utilized. Third, without intensive cultivation, the roots of crops cannot develop deep into the soil. The denser the planting, the smaller the area occupied by the roots of each plant. As a result, there is insufficient nutrition, poor development, and easy lodging. Therefore, intensive cultivation is the foundation of close planting. Fourth, without intensive cultivation, only the shallow soil layer can be utilized, and improved seeds and improved agricultural tools will have "no place to display their talents." Fifth, intensive cultivation removes grass roots and insect eggs, larvae, and plant pathogens hidden in the deep soil, which greatly helps to eliminate weeds and prevent pests and diseases. It can be seen that intensive cultivation is the central technical measure for increasing agricultural production and is the main direction of future efforts.

(2) In the spring and summer sowing of 1958, 120 million mu of land was intensively cultivated. Although this is a considerable number and an important condition for obtaining a bumper harvest this year, it is still less than one-tenth of the country's cultivated land area. At this rate, it will not be possible to intensively cultivate all cultivated land in ten years, which is not acceptable and far from meeting the requirements of a large increase in agricultural production and a doubling or tenfold increase in per-mu yield. According to the plans of the agricultural conferences of various collaboration zones held in July and August this year, all land that can be intensively cultivated should be intensively cultivated in the next two to three years; and intensive cultivation should be rotated every three years, cycle after cycle. The standard for intensive cultivation is one chi or more, and two chi or more for high-yield fields. In some places where there are indeed difficulties, it can also be achieved in two steps: the first step is to cultivate to a depth of six or seven cun, and the second step is to reach one chi or more. During intensive cultivation, care should be taken not to turn up the raw soil, which can be carried out in layers. The shallow topsoil is plowed and turned, and the deep subsoil is only plowed but not turned. Layered intensive cultivation should be combined with layered fertilization, fertilizing according to the soil, and improving the soil. For some fields where the soil layer is too thin to be intensively cultivated, measures should be taken in the next two to three years to "borrow topsoil" to thicken the soil layer to one chi or more; and different "foreign soils" should be borrowed according to different "native soils" to achieve the purpose of mixing sand with soil, using soil to suppress sand, and neutralizing acidity and alkalinity to improve the soil.

(3) The country needs to improve approximately 470 million mu of saline-alkali soil, red soil, sandy gravel land, drifting sand land, muddy paddy fields, cold water paddy fields, and other barren fields (excluding low-lying land). More than 140 million mu have been improved, and the remaining 330 million mu will be completely improved in two to three years. And different transformation methods should be adopted according to different soils. Based on existing experience, there are the following methods for improving soil. It is hoped that all localities will apply them according to local conditions and develop them.

    Heavy sandy soil – If there is silt under the sand, turn over the silt to suppress the sand; if there is no silt in the lower layer, move soil to suppress the sand; or use water sources to divert floods to flood the sand. For sandy gravel land, deeply cultivate and pick out the sandy gravel, plant cover crops and afforestation to prevent wind and fix sand.

    Heavy clay soil – If there is sand in the lower layer, turn over the sand to suppress the silt; if there is no sand in the lower layer, move sand to suppress the silt, plant green manure crops, and apply more organic fertilizer.

    Saline-alkali soil – Enclose and level embankments, store fresh water to suppress alkali, terrace fields to drain alkali, divert water to wash alkali, use gypsum to eliminate alkali, turn over the soil to suppress alkali if there is no alkali in the lower layer, cover the soil with sand or weeds to suppress alkali if the alkalinity is light, dig ditches to drain water if the groundwater level is too high, implement frequent and shallow irrigation, and fine ditch irrigation for rice cultivation to overcome large-scale flooding irrigation and prevent salinization.

    Barren mountainous land – Deeply plow and dig deeply, dig ditches along the contour, pick out the rocks, build terraced fields, maintain water and soil, and move soil to thicken the soil layer if it is too thin.

    Red and yellow soil – Apply more phosphate and potash fertilizers and organic fertilizers, plant green manure, and add lime if the acidity is too high.

    Muddy paddy fields and cold water paddy fields – Drain the water to dry the fields, deeply plow and expose to the sun, harrow thoroughly, and apply more organic fertilizer and wood ash.

(4) With the merging of large communes and the expansion of agricultural production scale, the demand for leveling land has been correspondingly raised. The content of land leveling includes: planning cultivated areas, organizing drainage and irrigation systems, merging large fields, repairing roads, relocating and merging villages, and reconfiguring residential areas, etc. It should be comprehensively planned according to different regions and different conditions, carried out in stages, and gradually realized. Land leveling should be combined with soil improvement, and in mountainous and hilly areas, it must also be combined with soil and water conservation.

(5) In order to realize the above-mentioned plans for intensive cultivation and soil improvement, it is necessary to put politics in command, mobilize the whole party, and mobilize all the people to start a high tide of intensive cultivation and soil improvement from now until the autumn planting this year and in the coming winter and spring. Intensive cultivation and soil improvement is the center of winter production this year, but water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation cannot be ignored. The average amount of labor used per mu for intensive cultivation and soil improvement greatly exceeds the average amount of labor used per mu for water conservancy projects. Therefore, there must be comprehensive planning, unified arrangement of labor, promotion of the communist spirit of cooperation, more ideas from the improvement of tools, and improvement of labor efficiency, so that the production upsurge centered on intensive cultivation and soil improvement in the winter of 1958 will be higher than the upsurge in the winter of 1957, ensuring that agricultural production in 1959 will leap forward even greater than in 1958.

    中共中央关于深耕和改良土壤的指示
    一九五八年八月二十九日
    （一）一年来的农业生产大跃进，不断涌现的高额丰产“卫星”，充分证明，深耕是农业增产技术措施的中心。“水肥土种密”，中心是土，就是深耕。因为，第一，深耕可以加厚松土层，在深耕的同时实行分层施肥，特别是厩肥、绿肥等有机肥料，促使深层的生土熟化，增加土壤中的团粒结构。每一个团粒，就是一个小水库，在深厚的土层中布满了这种无数的小水库，就大大增加了土壤含养水分和抗旱的能力。第二，土壤中的有机物质所含的养分，并不能被植物直接吸收，要变成矿物质的氧化物，溶解于水，才能被植物吸收。有机物质的这种分解作用主要是好气分解。所以，土壤中要有水，又要有空气。水和空气在同一空间是相互排挤的。土壤中的团粒结构，正好解决这个矛盾，团粒本身是个小水库，团粒之间的空隙则形成空气的走廊。这就有利于土壤中有机物质的分解，团粒也就成了小肥料库。如果不深耕，水和肥再多一些，也不能充分发挥作用。第三，如果不深耕，作物的根系不能向深处发展，种的越密，则每一个植株的根系所占的地盘越小，结果营养不足，发育不良，容易倒伏。所以说，深耕是密植的基础。第四，如果不深耕，只能利用浅层的土壤，优良种子和改良农具也将“英雄无用武之地”。第五，深耕挖掉了草根和藏在深土里的虫卵、幼虫和植物病菌，这大大有利于消灭杂草和防治病虫害。由此可见，深耕是农业增产技术措施的中心，是今后努力的主要方向。
    （二）在一九五八年的春播和夏播中，实行深耕的田地有一亿二千万亩，这虽然是一个不小的数目，是今年获得大丰收的一个重要条件，但是，还不到全国耕地面积的十分之一。按照这种进度，十年还做不到把全部耕地普遍深耕一遍，这是不行的，远不能适应农业大增产和成倍、成十倍地提高亩产量的要求。根据今年七、八月间分别召开的各协作区农业会议的规划，在今后两三年内，要把一切可能深耕的土地，全部深耕一遍；并且每三年轮流深耕一次，周而复始。深耕的标准是一尺以上，丰产田二尺以上。有的地方，确实有困难的，也可以分两步实现，第一步耕深六、七寸，第二步达到一尺以上。在深耕的时候，要注意不把生土翻上来，可以分层进行，浅层的熟土又犁又翻，深层的生土只犁不翻。分层深耕，要结合分层施肥，按土施肥，改良土壤。有些田地，土层太薄，不能深耕，则要在今后两三年内，采取“借客土”的办法，加厚土层到一尺以上；并且要按不同的“本土”，借不同的“客土”，达到沙搀土、土压沙、酸碱中和，改良土壤的目的。
    （三）全国需要改良的盐碱土、红壤土、沙礓地、飞沙地、烂泥田、冷水田和其他瘠薄的田地，粗略计算，约四亿七千万亩（低洼地不包括在内），已经改良的有一亿四千多万亩，其余的三亿三千万亩，在两三年内全部改完。并且要根据不同的土壤，采取不同的改造办法。根据已有的经验，有以下的一些改良土壤的办法，希望各地因地制宜地去运用，并且加以发展。
    重沙土——沙下有淤的翻淤压沙，下层无淤的搬土压沙，或者利用水源，引洪漫沙，有沙礓的深耕拣出沙礓，种植复盖作物和绿化造林，防风固沙。
    重粘土——下层有沙的翻沙压淤，下层无沙的搬沙压淤，种植绿肥作物和多施有机质肥料。
    盐碱地——围堰整平，蓄淡压碱，台田排碱，引水洗碱，石膏灭碱，下层无碱的翻土压碱，碱性轻的用沙或杂草复盖压碱，地下水位过高的挖沟排水，种植水稻的实行勤浇浅浇，细浇沟浇，克服大水漫灌，防止盐渍化。
    瘠薄的山地——深翻深挖，等高撩濠，拣出乱石，修筑梯田，保持水土，土层太薄的搬土培厚。
    红、黄壤土——多施磷钾肥料和有机肥料，种植绿肥，酸度过大的加石灰。
    烂泥田、冷水田——排水干田，深翻曝晒，耙透耙碎，多施有机肥料和草木灰。
    （四）并大社，农业生产规模扩大，相应地提出了平整土地的要求。平整土地的内容包括：规划耕作区，整理排灌系统，并大田块，整修道路，迁居并村和重新配置居民点，等等，应该根据不同地区、不同条件，全面规划，分期进行，逐步实现。平整土地应该与改良土壤相结合，在山区丘陵区还必须与水土保持相结合。
    （五）为了实现上述的深耕和改良土壤的规划，必须政治挂帅，全党动员，全民动手，从现在起，在今年秋种以前和今冬明春，掀起一个深耕和改良土壤运动的高潮。深耕和改良土壤，是今年冬季生产的中心，但是，水利和积肥也不可忽视。深耕和改良土壤，每亩地的平均用工量，大大超过水利工程每亩地的平均用工量。因此，必须有全面规划，统一安排劳动力，发扬共产主义的协作精神，从改良工具方面多打主意，提高劳动效率，使一九五八年冬季的以深耕和改良土壤为中心的生产高潮比一九五七年冬季的高潮还要高，保证一九五九年的农业生产比一九五八年更大地跃进。
