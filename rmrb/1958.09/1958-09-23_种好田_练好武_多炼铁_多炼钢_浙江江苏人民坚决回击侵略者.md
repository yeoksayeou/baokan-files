Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, September 22nd: The people of all circles in Zhejiang Province, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, who have been closely watching the situation in the Taiwan Strait area, held meetings yesterday and today to firmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev's renewed warning to Eisenhower. People from all walks of life expressed great anger at Dulles's shameless slander at the UN General Assembly, which was a complete reversal of black and white and utterly absurd. They are determined to spare no sacrifice and vow to fight to the end to resist aggression, liberate Jinmen and Mazu, and liberate Taiwan.

    The broad masses of workers in Hangzhou City yesterday angrily refuted Dulles's fallacy that our country's liberation of its own territory was "aggression" at the meeting. The workers of Hangzhou Boiler Factory said: American imperialism is invading everywhere, but it bites back and calls our country an "aggressor." This is utterly shameless. We have not fought with the United States, and there is no "ceasefire" issue at all; we liberate our own territory, and we will never allow American imperialism to interfere. The workers expressed that they would work hard and practically, accelerate the manufacture of metallurgical equipment, and use practical actions to strike at the American aggressors. The workers of Hangzhou Tractor Factory proposed at the meeting to build another 100 indigenous iron furnaces within five days, guaranteeing an iron output of 250 tons in September, and using molten iron to scald the American wolves of ambition to death. Many workers from Hangzhou Xianlinbu Steel Plant, Huafeng Paper Mill and other factories gave up their regular holidays and participated in voluntary labor, determined to use excellent production achievements to strike at the American bandits.

    The broad masses of peasants in Jiande, Jinhua, Hangzhou and other regions also held meetings, expressing their firm support for Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement. More than 1,500 rural work cadres in Fuyang County stated that they are determined to both cultivate the fields, make iron, and practice martial arts, and be ready to support the liberation of Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan at any time.

    Mei Gengou, deputy head of the militia regiment of Hangzhou West Lake People's Commune, said at the meeting that he would immediately mobilize the militia and carry out comprehensive training. The students of Zhejiang University, who had just formed a militia division, also expressed that they are ready to put down their books and rush to the front lines at any time, sparing no sacrifice to defend the territorial integrity of the motherland.

    People's organizations and local organizations of democratic parties in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City have issued statements or talks, firmly supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 22nd: People from all walks of life in Jiangsu Province warmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and are determined to use practical actions to repel the American aggressors.

    The province's 1.3 million workers are extremely angry at Dulles's shameless slander at the United Nations General Assembly. They are determined to vigorously engage in steelmaking and ironmaking under the leadership of the Party, overfulfill the steel production plan, and support the struggle to liberate the coastal islands and liberate Taiwan. The ironmaking workers of the Nanjing Coal Construction Wholesale Department guarantee to increase the daily output of pig iron three to four times from the 22nd. The steel workers of the Nanjing Automobile Factory insisted on making iron in the heavy rain. They said: "It rains from the sky, sweat drips from our bodies, molten iron is smelted in the furnace, and we will drown the American devils!"

    The broad masses of peasants in Jiangsu Province expressed extreme anger at the US imperialists' repeated violations of our country's territorial waters and airspace and Dulles's upside-down speech. Farmer Zhao Chengsong said: "The American robbers treat our government's statements and warnings as water off a duck's back. The Chinese people's forbearance is limited. I am a militiaman and I will definitely respond to the call of the motherland at any time."

    The People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed in Jiangsu Province are supporting Foreign Minister Chen's statement with practical actions to strengthen war preparedness. Young women throughout the province have also stated that they will both produce and practice martial arts, and be ready to strike at the aggressors at any time.

    江苏省广大农民对美帝国主义多次侵犯我国领海领空和杜勒斯颠倒黑白的演说，表示极为愤怒。农民赵成松说：“我国政府的声明、警告，美国强盗只当耳边风。中国人民的忍让是有限度的。我是一个民兵，一定随时响应祖国的召唤。”
