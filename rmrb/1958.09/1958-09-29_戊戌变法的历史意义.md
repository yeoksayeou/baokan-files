	The Historical Significance of the Hundred Days' Reform
	Fan Wenlan

Our historical circles held an academic discussion meeting on September 28th to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Hundred Days' Reform. The reason for choosing this day is that the "Six Gentlemen," led by Tan Sitong, shed their blood on this day sixty years ago. They contributed their blood to oppose the reactionary feudal forces, making it the most important day of the entire movement.

During the period of the old democratic revolution, the Chinese bourgeoisie did two major things politically: one was the Hundred Days' Reform movement in 1898, which was a reformist movement, and the larger one was the Xinhai Revolution movement in 1911. Today's meeting is to discuss the historical role and significance of the Hundred Days' Reform movement.

Generally speaking, reformist movements are reactionary in nature, but at the time of the Wuxu year, the reform movement represented the trend of Chinese social development and had progressive significance. Therefore, what we commemorate is only the reform movement of that Wuxu year, and the figures we praise are only given appropriate historical evaluation based on their role in this movement. This is strictly different politically from the reformist movements and reformists after the Wuxu year, and should not be confused, which must be made clear.

As early as the second half of the nineteenth century, a portion of Chinese merchants, landlords, and bureaucrats began to invest in modern industries. These people could only be regarded as the predecessors of the Chinese bourgeoisie, and it was impossible for them to put forward bourgeois political demands. By the end of the same century, Chinese national capitalism had achieved preliminary development, forming a new social class—the national bourgeoisie. This class maintained extremely close relations with the feudal landlord class, while also having the demand to put forward political demands. It attempted to follow the path of the Japanese Meiji Restoration, seeking some conditions for developing capitalism without infringing upon the fundamental rights of the landlord class. The reformist faction represented by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao appeared on the historical stage to adapt to such class demands. Therefore, it can be said that the reform movement was in line with the trend of social development at that time.

China, which had already been reduced to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal state, had no future in which the reformist faction could be fortunate enough to succeed. Imperialism did not allow China to develop capitalism. Some imperialists expressed a posture of assistance, of course, with ulterior motives. The feudal die-hard forces were the mortal enemies of capitalism. Their expression of temporary tolerance was only waiting for an opportunity to act. A group of isolated and helpless reformists, supporting a Guangxu Emperor who had no power or courage, issued orders and decrees, thinking that the opportune moment to achieve great things had arrived, and hoping to change the face of society by relying on the Guangxu Emperor's edicts and decrees. This just illustrates the weakness of the Chinese bourgeoisie, making the movement so weak and powerless. Of course, the movement had fought against the most stubborn feudal forces and expressed patriotic enthusiasm by feeling the danger of imperialist aggression, but this was all in vain. Once the feudal die-hards acted, the movement dissipated and failed, never to recover.

The Chinese people must learn lessons from the history of revolutionary movements, and they can also learn lessons from the reformist movement. The biggest lesson the Hundred Days' Reform movement gives us is that even a reformist movement with progressive significance is undesirable.

Then, can we negate the progressive significance of the Hundred Days' Reform movement because it had no political future? We cannot.

The progressive significance of the Hundred Days' Reform movement is mainly manifested in the intellectual liberation of intellectuals. The Chinese feudal system has continued for thousands of years, with infinite harm. The Qing Dynasty rulers chose a whole set of feudal poisons to paralyze intellectuals, striving to make them lose the function of their brains and submit to corrupt rule. These poisons were the Cheng-Zhu school of Neo-Confucianism, the imperial examination system, the eight-legged essay, the study of ancient classics (textual research), and so on. All things that protected the feudal system were generally labeled with the signboard of Confucius, and no one was allowed to shake their heads. The breadth and depth of its harm, along with opium symbolizing imperialism (of course, not just opium), can be called the two evils at home and abroad, colluding from the inside and outside, to take China's life. The thinkers led by Kang Youwei openly shook their heads at the poisons that the Qing Dynasty was accustomed to using, using the Lu-Wang school to oppose the Cheng-Zhu school, using modern text to oppose ancient text, using schools and policy debates to oppose the imperial examination and the eight-legged essay. All measures needed by the bourgeoisie were also generally labeled with the signboard of Confucius, changing "narrating and not creating" into "reforming by borrowing from antiquity," using Confucius to oppose Confucius, thereby reducing the pressure of "not being holy and lawless." At that time, a whole set of poisons was greatly impacted, and intellectuals from then on added some capitalist ideas to feudal thought, which should be said to be a step forward compared to completely feudal thought. Some of the more radical people jumped out of the reformist circle and joined the bourgeois revolutionary faction, and their thinking took another step forward.

This was an intellectual liberation for Chinese intellectuals, although it was only the first step, it was a very important step.

Kang Youwei also wrote a "Book of Great Harmony" that was "secretly not shown to others," the general idea of which was that feudal society was a chaotic world, capitalist society was a prosperous (xiaokang) world, and communist society was a peaceful (datong) world. He described a "world of great harmony where the world is for all, without classes, and all are equal," showing a rich political imagination. The paradise he yearned for was "public agriculture," "public industry," and "public commerce," eliminating private property in a peaceful world. He saw that "now, to achieve great harmony, it is necessary to eliminate people's private property, and all agricultural, industrial, and commercial undertakings belong to the public," and the elimination of private property must start from "eliminating people's families" (changing the nature of the family). This kind of great harmony thought, of course, only remained an illusion in his mind, and he did not and could not find a way to reach great harmony. But the reason why Kang Youwei surpassed all the thinkers of the time and occupied a prominent position in the history of political thought is because he was able to speak of this noble illusion. Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese society has begun to transition from socialism to communism, and will soon realize the scientific world of great harmony. All those who sincerely adhere to Kang Youwei's great harmony thought, seeing with their own eyes that after only sixty short years, the world of great harmony has turned from an illusion into reality, will be so excited, cheering for China's Great Leap Forward and helping it in some way.

The above-mentioned reform ideas and great harmony ideas were all expressed by relying on Confucianism, which is proof that the bourgeoisie at that time could not stand on its own feet and had to rely on the feudal landlord class to act and speak. When the bourgeoisie was able to stand on its own feet, but its thinking was still unwilling to separate from feudalism, it became reactionary and stubborn thinking.

The Hundred Days' Reform movement was the first liberation of thought. After that, according to the gradual increase in the degree of social development, there appeared one thought liberation movement after another that was broader and deeper. Here is a brief description:

In 1905, the Revolutionary Alliance led by Sun Yat-sen was established, proclaiming the ideal of establishing a bourgeois democratic republic and carrying out a revolutionary struggle against the feudal Qing Dynasty. This was a manifestation that the bourgeoisie had already stood on its own feet. The Xinhai Revolution in 1911 overthrew the Qing Dynasty government, ended China's feudal monarchy of more than two thousand years, and produced the Republic of China and the revolutionary Provisional Government of Nanjing, and produced a Provisional Constitution. No matter how many weaknesses the revolutionaries had, compared with the reformers, it was undoubtedly a big step forward. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the "Report on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China": "This Provisional Constitution has the nature of a bourgeois republic constitution and has progressive significance. The Xinhai Revolution made the concept of a democratic republic deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, making people generally recognize that any words and actions that violate this concept are illegal." Through the Provisional Constitution, the Xinhai Revolution established the concept of old democracy, and intellectuals were affected, and the broad masses of the people were also affected. In the process of ideological liberation, this was a wider and deeper liberation, and the reformist idea of supporting constitutional monarchy was naturally abandoned by the people.

Since the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919, China began to enter the great stage of the New Democratic Revolution. In 1921, the Chinese Communist Party was established, and based on communist cultural thought, that is, the communist worldview and social revolution theory, it led the New Culture Movement. The new cultural force led by Lu Xun, under the leadership of the Party, carried out resolute and sharp anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles against the cultural thoughts of imperialism and feudalism. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On New Democracy": "This new force has achieved great development in the fields of social science and literature and art... In the past twenty years, the edge of this new cultural force, from thought to form (writing, etc.), has undergone great revolutions. Its momentum is so vast and its power is so fierce that it is simply invincible. The breadth of its mobilization exceeds any historical era in China." This New Culture Revolution, accompanied by the continued development of the entire revolution, has developed, and through many political movements and study movements, the Chinese people's thinking has been fundamentally and epoch-makingly liberated. The decadent cultural thoughts left over from the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society will be thoroughly swept away, and the cultural thoughts of the old democracy will also be abandoned by the people.

Now, China's socialist revolution has achieved great victory, and the socialist revolution on the ideological front has also achieved a decisive victory. However, although all exploiting classes have been eliminated, the ideology of the exploiting classes, mainly bourgeois ideology, will remain in the minds of some stubborn elements for a period of time, and still needs to be thoroughly eliminated. The matter is so clear that under the illumination of Marxism, the people of the whole country, with the communist style, go all out, strive for the upper reaches, and build a socialist society in a faster, better, and more economical way. If there are still people who are nostalgic for bourgeois ideas, or even delusional to succeed, then the wheel of the times, as in the past, will be ruthless to backwardness.

We are delighted and encouraged by the great victory of today's socialist revolution and the complete liberation of the people's thinking. We look back with pleasure at the achievements of the New Democratic Cultural Revolution since the May Fourth Movement in ideological liberation, and then look back at the impact of the Xinhai Revolution on ideological liberation during the old democratic revolution period, and then look back at the significance of the Wuxu Reformist thought against completely feudal thought. We can draw such a conclusion that thought develops with the development of society, low-level thought must be replaced by high-level thought, and thought that stays in the original position must be abandoned by the times. History is so ruthless and yet affectionate, not forgetting every contribution to history, nor tolerating every obstacle to history.

From the time when the predecessor of the bourgeoisie appeared in the second half of the nineteenth century to the present day when the bourgeoisie was eliminated, it has lived for a hundred years. In its lifetime, during the New Democratic Revolution, it was aging and could not lead the revolution. During the old democratic revolution, it led two political movements. Strictly speaking, it only led one Xinhai Revolution. The Hundred Days' Reform was a reformist movement, although it was progressive, it did not belong to the category of revolution. We commemorate its first struggle against complete feudalism at the time when the bourgeoisie has died, in order to illustrate the irresistibility of the laws of historical development as an example. Capitalist thought must oppose feudalist thought, just as socialist thought must oppose capitalist thought. To go along with it is progress, and to go against it is reaction. Since we commemorate the Hundred Days' Reform movement sixty years ago because the bourgeoisie opposed complete feudalism, then, during the socialist revolution period, there is no doubt that all progressive forces must work together to completely eliminate the bourgeois ideology that hinders social development. Simply commemorating the past is meaningless.

Marxist historiography uses the viewpoint of historical materialism to look at all history. That is to say, taking the laws of social development as the criterion, observing the behavior of events and figures in that situation according to a certain time, place, and conditions, and what role they played in society. Whether it is right or wrong is a conclusion made by the events and figures themselves. To love and want to promote it, and to hate and want to suppress it, are both in vain. Therefore, the same events and figures are progressive and meritorious in some situations. If the situation changes, they will become reactionary and have faults. Secondly, progress and reaction cannot be generalized. Saying it is progress does not mean that certain reactionary components it contains can be exempted. Saying it is reactionary does not mean that certain beneficial components it contains (if any) can be erased. This can only be achieved through careful analysis. Thirdly, a progressive person becomes reactionary later, which is changing from good to bad. Conversely, a reactionary person becomes progressive later, which is changing from bad to good. History will make a final judgment based on their final performance. Everything lies in one's own actions, and history is only a fair record.

    戊戌变法的历史意义
    范文澜
    我们史学界在9月28日开学术讨论会来纪念戊戌变法六十周年。为什么要选择在这一天，因为以谭嗣同为首的“六君子”是在六十年前的这一天流血的。他们为反对反动封建势力而贡献出自己的鲜血，整个运动的日子里，这是最值得重视的一天。
    旧民主主义革命时期，中国资产阶级在政治上做了两件大事，一件是1898年的戊戌变法运动，即改良主义运动。更大的一件是1911年的辛亥革命运动。今天我们开这个会是讨论戊戌变法运动在历史上的作用和意义。
    一般说来，改良主义运动是反动性质的运动，但在戊戌那个时候，变法运动代表着中国社会发展的趋势，赋有进步的意义，因此，我们要纪念的仅仅是那个戊戌年的变法运动，要表扬的人物，也仅仅是按照他们在这个运动里所起作用而给以适当的历史评价。这同戊戌以后的改良主义运动和改良主义者，政治上有严格的区别，决不可以混为一谈，这一点必须说清楚。
    早在十九世纪下半期，中国开始有一部分商人、地主和官僚投资于新式工业。这些人还只算是中国资产阶级的前身，还不可能提出资产阶级的政治主张。到了同世纪的末年，中国民族资本主义得到初步的发展，形成了新的社会阶级——民族资产阶级。这个阶级同封建地主阶级保持着极为密切的关系，同时又有提出政治主张的要求，它企图走日本明治维新的道路，在不触犯地主阶级根本权利的基础上求得一些发展资本主义的条件。以康有为、梁启超为代表的改良主义派，就是为适应这样的阶级要求而出现在历史舞台上。所以说，变法运动是符合于当时社会发展的趋势的。
    已经沦为半殖民地半封建的中国，决没有改良主义派可能幸获的前途。帝国主义不允许中国发展资本主义，某些帝国主义表示相助的姿态，当然是别有用心；封建顽固势力是资本主义的死敌，它表示暂时的容忍，只是待机而动。一群孤立无援缺乏实力的改良主义者，拥戴一个无拳无勇的光绪帝，发号施令，以为大有可为的时机已到，希望凭借光绪帝的谕旨条令来改变社会的面貌，正好说明中国资产阶级的软弱性，使得运动也那样软弱无力。固然，运动曾是反对最顽固的封建势力，进行了斗争；感到帝国主义侵略的危急，表示了爱国的热情，但这都是徒然的，封建顽固派一动手，运动便消散失败，一蹶不复振。
    中国人民要在革命运动的历史里吸取教训，也可以在改良主义运动中吸取教训。戊戌变法运动给我们最大的教训就是：即使是含有进步意义的改良主义运动，也是要不得的。
    那末，可不可以把戊戌变法运动的进步意义，因为它在政治上的无前途而予以抹煞呢？不可以。
    戊戌变法运动的进步意义，主要表现在知识分子得到一次思想上的解放。中国的封建制度，相沿几千年，流毒无限。清朝统治者，选择一整套封建毒品来麻痹知识分子，务使失去头脑的作用，驯服在腐朽统治之下。这些毒品是程朱理学、科举制度、八股文章、古文经学（训诂考据）等等，所有保护封建制度的东西，一概挂上孔圣人的招牌，不许有人摇一摇头，其为害之广之深，与象征帝国主义的鸦片（当然不只是鸦片），可称中外二竖，里应外合，要中国的命。以康有为为首的思想家们，公然对清朝用惯了的毒品大摇其头，拿陆王来对抗程朱，拿今文来对抗古文，拿学校和策论来对抗科举和八股，所有资产阶级所需要的措施，也一概挂上孔圣人的招牌，把述而不作改变成托古改制，拿孔子来对抗孔子，因此，减轻了非圣无法的压力。当时一整套毒品，受到了巨大的冲荡，知识分子从此在封建思想里添加一些资本主义思想，比起完全封建思想来，应该说，前进了一步。其中有些比较激进的人，跳出改良主义圈子，加入资产阶级革命派，思想又前进了一步。
    这是中国知识分子的一次思想解放，虽然仅仅走了第一步，却是很值得重视的一步。
    康有为还写了一部“秘不以示人”的大同书，大意是说封建社会是据乱世，资本主义社会是升平（小康）世，公产主义社会是太平（大同）世。他描述“大同之世，天下为公，无有阶级，一切平等”的“极乐世界”，表现出丰富的政治想像力。他向往的极乐世界是“公农”、“公工”、“公商”，消除私有财产的和平世界。他看到“今欲致大同，必去人之私产而后可，凡农工商之业皆归之公”，去私产必须从“去人之家始”（改变家的性质）。这种大同思想，当然只是停留在头脑中的空想，他没有也不能找到一条到达大同的路。但康有为所以高出当时的一切思想家，在政治思想史上占有卓越的地位，就是因为他能够说出这种高尚的空想。现在，中国社会在中国共产党领导下，已经从社会主义开始向共产主义过渡，很快就要实现科学的大同之世。凡是真心服膺康有为大同思想的人们，亲眼看见经过短短的六十年，大同之世从空想变成现实，将是多么兴奋，为中国的大跃进而欢呼而有所协助。
    上述变法思想、大同思想，都是依附着儒家学说来表现的，这正是当时资产阶级还不能自立，还得依附封建地主阶级而行动而言论的证明。到了资产阶级已能自立，而思想还不肯同封建主义分家，那就成为反动顽固的思想了。
    戊戌变法运动是思想的第一次解放，此后，按照社会发展程度的逐步提高，出现了一次比一次广泛和深刻的思想解放运动，这里简单地叙述如下：
    1905年成立以孙中山为首的革命同盟会，揭櫫着建立资产阶级民主共和国的理想，对封建主义的清朝进行了革命斗争，这是资产阶级已经自立的表现。1911年辛亥革命，推翻了清朝政府，结束了中国两千多年来的封建帝制，产生了中华民国和革命的南京临时政府，并产生了一个临时约法。不管革命派存在着多大的弱点，比起改良派来，无疑是大进了一步。刘少奇同志在“关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告”里指出：“这个临时约法具有资产阶级共和国宪法的性质，是有进步意义的。辛亥革命使民主共和国的观念从此深入人心，使人们公认，任何违反这个观念的言论和行动都是非法的”。辛亥革命通过临时约法，建立起旧民主主义的观念来，知识分子受到影响，广大人民群众也受到影响，在思想解放过程中，这是较广泛较深刻的一次解放，拥护君主立宪的改良派思想，自然为人民所抛弃。
    自1919年“五四”运动开始，中国开始进入了伟大的新民主主义革命阶段。1921年中国共产党成立，便依据共产主义的文化思想，即共产主义的宇宙观和社会革命论，领导起新文化革命。以鲁迅为主将的文化生力军，在党的领导下，针对帝国主义封建主义的文化思想进行着坚决的锐利的反帝反封建的斗争。毛主席在“新民主主义论”里指出：“这支生力军在社会科学领域和文学艺术领域中……都有了极大的发展。二十年来，这个文化新军的锋芒所向，从思想到形式（文字等），无不起了极大的革命。其声势之浩大，威力之猛烈，简直是所向无敌的。其动员之广大，超过中国任何历史时代”。这个新文化革命，伴随着整个革命的继续发展而发展，经过多次的政治运动和学习运动，中国人民群众的思想得到根本性的划时代的大解放，半殖民地半封建社会残留的腐朽文化思想，将彻底地被扫除，旧民主主义的文化思想也为人民所抛弃。
    现在，中国社会主义革命已经取得了伟大的胜利，在思想战线上的社会主义革命，也取得了决定性的胜利。不过，一切剥削阶级虽然消灭了，剥削阶级思想主要是资产阶级思想，将会在某些顽固分子的头脑里残留一个时期，还有待于彻底的消灭。事情如此明白，在马克思主义的照耀下，全国人民以共产主义的风格鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义社会，如果还有人对资产阶级思想有所留恋，甚至还妄想一逞，那末，时代的巨轮同过去一样，对落后将是无情的。
    我们为今天社会主义革命的伟大胜利和全民思想得到彻底解放而欢欣鼓舞。我们以愉快的心情回顾到从五四运动开始的新民主主义文化革命对思想解放的成就，又从而回顾到旧民主主义革命时期辛亥革命对思想解放的影响，再从而回顾到戊戌维新思想对抗完全封建思想的意义。我们可以得这样的结论，思想是随着社会的发展而发展的，低级思想必然为高级思想所代替，停留在原位上的思想必然为时代所抛弃。历史多么无情而又有情，不遗忘每一个对历史的贡献，也不宽容每一个对历史的障碍。
    从十九世纪下半期出现资产阶级前身时开始，到资产阶级消灭的今天为止，它享寿一百岁。在它的一生中，新民主主义革命时期，它衰老了，不能领导革命了。旧民主主义革命时期，它领导过两次政治运动，严格说来，它只领导过一次辛亥革命。戊戌变法是改良主义运动，虽然是含有进步性，但不属于革命的范畴。我们在资产阶级已经寿终的时候纪念它第一次对完全封建主义所作的斗争，为的要作为一个例阐明历史发展规律的不可抗拒性。资本主义思想必须反对封建主义思想，犹之社会主义思想必须反对资本主义思想。顺而行之是进步，逆而行之是反动。我们既然因资产阶级反对完全封建主义而纪念六十年前的戊戌变法运动，那末，在社会主义革命时期，毫无疑问，一切进步力量必须为彻底消灭障碍社会发展的资产阶级思想而共同努力。单纯地纪念过去，那是没有意义的。
    马克思主义的历史学，是用历史唯物主义的观点来看全部历史的。这就是说，以社会发展规律为准绳，按照一定的时间、地点和条件，观察事件和人物在那种情况下所表现的行为，对社会起了什么作用。是非功过是事件和人物自身作出的结论，爱而欲其扬，恶而欲其抑，都不免徒劳而无益。所以，同一的事件和人物，在某种情况下是进步的有功的，如果情况改换，就会变成反动的有过的，其次，进步与反动也不可一概而论。说是进步，不等于所含某些反动的成分可以免除，说是反动，也不等于所含某些有益的成分（如果有的话）可以抹煞，这只有认真作分析才能求得其平。再其次，一个进步的人，到后来反动了，这是从好变坏，反之，一个反动的人，后来进步了，这是从坏变好，历史将以他们最后的表现作出最后的论定。一切在于本身的行动，历史只是公正的记录。
