Filming the Great Leap Forward in Steelmaking
    New Film Studio Supports the "Steel Marshal"

    (Our Dispatch) In the upsurge of the mass steelmaking movement, the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, in order to widely introduce steelmaking methods, promote advanced smelting technology, and boost steel production, is heavily involved in filming steelmaking documentaries to directly serve the goal of producing 10.7 million tons of steel annually. On September 17th, three groups were dispatched to Lushan in Henan Province, Tianjin in Hebei Province, and other places to film. It is expected that the films will be released by the end of this month.

    The studio also recently produced a film called "How to Smelt Ferrosilicon?". This film is specifically about introducing methods of smelting ferrosilicon and can be considered a film textbook on ferrosilicon smelting technology. From interviewing, writing the script, filming, post-production, to completion, the film took less than three days, which is also a remarkable record in film history.

    大拍炼钢炼铁的影片
    新影支援钢元帅
    本报讯　在全民炼钢铁的热潮中，中央新闻纪录电影制片厂为了广泛地介绍炼钢炼铁的方法和推广先进的冶炼技术，促进钢铁的生产，大拍炼钢炼铁的影片，使新闻纪录电影直接为年产一千零七十万吨钢服务，9月17日已派出三批人马分赴河南省鲁山、河北省天津等地去拍摄，预计本月底可以出片。
    新影最近还拍了一部片子叫“怎样炼矽铁”？这部影片是专门介绍炼矽铁的方法的，可以说是一部矽铁冶炼技术的电影教科书。这部影片从采访、写剧本、拍摄、后期制作到完成仅仅花了不足三天的时间，这在电影史上也是一个惊人的纪录。　（草草）
