　　High-Yield Red Banner to be Planted on Blast Furnaces
　　By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    The provocations of U.S. imperialism cannot stop the pace of our country's socialist construction. On the steel front, workers are using actions to guarantee the completion and strive to exceed 10.7 million tons of steel, using unprecedented high-yield records to strike at the shameless aggressors. The workers of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant have planted the first high-yield iron smelting red banner on their blast furnace. This plant has maintained the most advanced blast furnace utilization coefficient record for four consecutive months, and in August it further leaped to 0.517. Currently, all the plant's workers are full of energy, striving to go further and make the blast furnace utilization coefficient reach below 0.5.
    The good or bad of the blast furnace utilization coefficient has a significant relationship to increasing pig iron production. For a 1,000 cubic meter blast furnace effective volume, every 0.2 improvement in the utilization coefficient can increase pig iron production by about 100,000 tons per year. In 1957, the average utilization coefficient of all blast furnaces in our country was 0.757, which means that to smelt one ton of iron, every 24 hours required 0.757 cubic meters of furnace body volume. A year before, many people dared not even think about improving the blast furnace utilization coefficient to 0.6 or below. But now, thanks to the efforts of all the workers of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, this superstition has been fundamentally broken. Their deeds prove that our blast furnace utilization coefficient can not only reach 0.6, but also 0.5, and even the workers of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant are now marching towards breaking through 0.5 with heroic spirit. Since the workers in our country's metallurgical industry can raise the production indicators of blast furnaces, which are not easy to control, to the highest level in the world, what complex technologies can't we quickly master?
    The fact that Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant has raised high the red banner of high-yield iron smelting is not because it has any more advantageous conditions than other iron and steel plants. On the contrary, the blast furnace equipment of this iron and steel plant is very old. Before this year, their utilization coefficient was also very backward, remaining at around 0.75 for a long time. It was only because, under the leadership of the Party, all the workers engaged in extensive airing of views and debates, overcame the "theory of conditions," broke free from the shackles of dogmatism and empiricism, dared to plant red banners, dared to do things that people had never done before, and dared to set goals to reach advanced indicators that had not been achieved in the world. This has broken another superstition, which is that some people have always believed that advanced indicators can only be created by enterprises with good conditions and new equipment. Many facts precisely prove that the current high-yield red banner has not been planted in those factories with modern equipment, but has appeared in factories with outdated equipment. This eloquently demonstrates that the decisive factor for advanced indicators is not the equipment itself, but whether people's subjective initiative is fully utilized, and whether people's wisdom is tapped.
    In other words, we have every reason to ask this question: since Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, with its not-so-good equipment conditions, can achieve the world's most advanced production indicators, why can't other iron and steel plants, such as those in Anshan, Chongqing, and Ma'anshan, establish high-yield red banners?
    We hope that when everyone reads the news of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant's high-yield red banner, they will also look at a comparison table. From this comparison table, it can be seen that in August, the blast furnace utilization coefficient of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant was 0.173 lower than that of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was 0.105 lower, Anshan Iron and Steel Company was 0.152 lower, and Ma'anshan Iron Plant was 0.229 lower. The blast furnace conditions of these factories are not worse than those of Benxi, especially Anshan Iron and Steel Company. As everyone knows, its blast furnaces are modern, but their utilization coefficient is far behind Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant. And what is worth noting is that the distance is getting wider and wider. In 1957, the blast furnace utilization coefficient of Anshan Iron and Steel Company was originally better than that of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant (Anshan was 0.709, and Benxi No. 1 Plant was 0.760). In the first quarter of this year, Benxi was still catching up with Anshan, but in no time at all, Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, which was originally behind, pulled the one that was originally ahead of it far behind. From April onwards, Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant leaped up and planted a high-yield red banner, and from then on, like a galloping horse, it sped forward, while the blast furnaces of Anshan did not see a major leap forward.
    The same blast furnaces, but the utilization coefficients are vastly different; the same blast furnaces, one changed from backward to advanced, and the other changed from advanced to relatively backward. This fully demonstrates that this is not a matter of objective conditions. The reason why these factories are lagging behind is because they have not truly put politics in command, have not honestly told the broad masses of workers the true situation of backwardness, and have not mobilized everyone to think of ways together to strive for advancement. Therefore, the role of the masses has not been fully brought into play, and the intelligence and talents of the worker comrades have also been buried.
    Now the people of the whole country are fighting for the production of 10.7 million tons of steel this year. All the worker comrades in the iron and steel plants should do their utmost to improve the blast furnace utilization coefficient, bring out the spirit of combat, chase the red banner, catch up with the red banner, and plant the high-yield red banner on their own positions.

　　高炉上要插高产红旗
　　本报评论员
    美帝国主义的挑衅，挡不住我国建设社会主义的步伐。在钢铁战线上，职工们用保证完成和力争超过一千零七十万吨钢的行动，用前所未有的高产纪录，来打击无耻的侵略者。本溪第一炼铁厂的职工插起了第一面高炉炼铁红旗，这个厂已经连续四个月保持了高炉利用系数最先进的纪录，8月份又进一步跃进到零点五一七。目前全厂职工鼓足干劲，要百尺竿头更进一步，使高炉利用系数达到零点五以下。
    高炉利用系数的好和坏，对增加生铁的产量有重大关系，一千立方公尺的高炉有效容积，利用系数每改善零点二，一年就可以增产生铁十万吨左右。1957年，我国所有高炉的平均利用系数是零点七五七，就是说，每炼一吨铁，每一昼夜需要零点七五七立方公尺的炉体容积。在这一年，全国最高的纪录是鞍钢的六号炉，月平均利用系数达到零点六六三。在一年以前，把高炉利用系数改进到零点六和零点六以下，许多人是连想都不敢想的。但是现在，由于本溪第一炼铁厂全体职工的努力，已经从根本上破除了这个迷信。他们的事迹证明了我国高炉的利用系数不但可以达到零点六，而且可以达到零点五，甚至本溪第一炼铁厂的职工，现在正以英雄气概向突破零点五进军。我国冶金工业的职工既然能把生产情况不容易控制的高炉生产指标提到世界最高的水平，那么，又有什么复杂的技术我们不能够迅速掌握呢？
    本溪第一炼铁厂高高举起炼铁高产的红旗，并不是因为它有什么比其他炼铁厂优越的条件，相反，这个炼铁厂高炉设备是很陈旧的，在今年以前，他们的利用系数也是很落后的，它长期停留在零点七五左右。只是由于在党的领导下，全体职工大鸣大放，攻倒了“条件论”，破除了教条主义和经验主义的束缚，敢于插红旗，敢于做人们从未做过的事情，敢于设想要达到世界上未达到的先进指标。这又破除了一个迷信，就是一些人一向所认为的先进指标只有那些条件好、设备新的企业才能创造。许多事实恰恰证明，现在的高产红旗并没有插在那些有近代化设备的厂子里，而偏偏在设备陈旧的厂子里出现了高产红旗。这就雄辩地说明对先进指标起着决定的作用的，首先不是设备本身，而是看人们的主观能动性是否充分发挥，是看人们的聪明智慧是否发掘出来。
    换一句话说，我们完全有理由这样提出问题：既然设备条件并不好的本溪第一炼铁厂，能够出现世界最先进的生产指标，为什么别的炼铁厂，例如鞍山、重庆、马鞍山等地的炼铁厂不能树立起高产红旗呢？
    我们希望大家在看本溪第一炼铁厂的高产红旗消息的同时，再看一看一个比较表，从这个比较表里可以看出：8月份石景山钢铁厂高炉利用系数比本溪第一炼铁厂落后零点一七三，太原钢铁厂落后零点一零五，鞍山钢铁公司落后零点一五二，马鞍山铁厂落后零点二二九。这些厂子的高炉条件并不比本溪差，特别是鞍山钢铁公司，大家知道，它的高炉是近代化的，但是，他们的利用系数却远远落在本溪第一炼铁厂的后面。而且值得严重注意的是距离越来越远。在1957年，鞍山钢铁公司高炉利用系数本来是比本溪第一炼铁厂好的（鞍钢是零点七零九，本溪一厂是零点七六零），今年第一季本溪还在追赶鞍山，但是曾几何时，落在后面的本溪第一炼铁厂，就把原在它前边的，远远地拉在后边。从4月份起，本溪第一炼铁厂一跃而树起了高产红旗，从此像一匹骏马一般，飞奔前进，而鞍钢的高炉却不见大的跃进。
    同样的高炉，而利用系数却相差甚远；同样的高炉，一个从落后变成先进，一个却从先进变成相对的落后，这充分说明了这不是什么客观条件问题。这些厂子所以落后，就是因为没有真正的政治挂帅，没有把落后的真实情况老老实实地告诉广大职工，发动大家共同想办法，争取先进。因此在那里，群众的作用没有充分发挥出来，工人同志的聪明才智也被埋没起来。
    现在全国人民正在为今年产一千零七十万吨钢而战斗，全体炼铁厂的职工同志，都应极力改善高炉利用系数，要拿出战斗精神追红旗、赶红旗，把高产红旗插到自己的阵地上。
