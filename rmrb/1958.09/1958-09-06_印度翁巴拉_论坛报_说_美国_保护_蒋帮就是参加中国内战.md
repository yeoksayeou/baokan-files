Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 5th. The Indian Ambala "Tribune" stated in an editorial published on the 4th that China's demand for the recovery of coastal islands and Taiwan is justified, and that the United States' "protection" of the Chiang Kai-shek group "is equivalent to the United States openly participating in China's civil war."

The newspaper, in criticizing the U.S.'s China policy, pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek group's rule in Taiwan relies on absolute terror and open suppression of the people, as well as on U.S. military aid. The newspaper warned that "it would obviously be unwise to insist on a wrong path simply because admitting a mistake would lose prestige."

The newspaper also accused the United States of not only undermining the United Nations Charter and international law, but also of "intensifying the Cold War" in the Far East.

"The Leader" also called on the United States to change its policy towards China as soon as possible, because the current tense situation "has a harmful impact on world peace."

The "Bombay Chronicle" published an editorial on the 3rd stating that "opinion is increasingly firmly opposed to Dulles' emotional challenges and implicit threats."

It also said that "if another international crisis is created here due to errors, negligence, ignorance, or deliberate action, it will be a serious blow to the Eisenhower administration, because it shows that the United States is once again incapable of facing serious problems in foreign policy in another occasion."

The "Indian National Daily" said on the 2nd that the United States' strengthening of its military forces in the Taiwan Strait "is causing unease to all those who hope to ease the situation in this region."

    印度翁巴拉“论坛报”说
　　美国“保护”蒋帮就是参加中国内战
    新华社新德里5日电　印度翁巴拉“论坛报”在4日发表社论说，中国关于收复沿海岛屿和台湾的要求是正当的，而美国给予蒋介石集团的“保护等于是美国公开参加中国的内战”。
    报纸在抨击美国的对华政策时指出，蒋介石集团在台湾的统治是依靠绝对的恐怖和公开的镇压人民，并且依靠美国的军事援助。这家报纸警告说，“如果仅仅因为承认错误将丧失威信而坚持错误的道路，这将显然是不明智的。”
    这家报纸还指责了美国不仅破坏联合国宪章和国际法，而且在远东“加剧冷战”。
    “领袖报”也要求美国早日改变对待中国的政策，因为目前的紧张局势“对世界和平产生有害的影响”。
    “孟买纪事报”3日发表社论说，“舆论日益坚定地反对杜勒斯发出的感情冲动的挑战和含蓄的威胁”。
    它又说，“如果由于错误、疏忽、无知或者故意而在这里造成另一次国际危机，那将是对艾森豪威尔政府的一个严重打击，因为这说明美国又在另一个场合中没有能力正视外交政策中的严重问题。”
    “印度民族日报”2日说，美国在台湾海峡加强军事力量“正在使所有希望缓和这一地区局势的人们感到不安”。
