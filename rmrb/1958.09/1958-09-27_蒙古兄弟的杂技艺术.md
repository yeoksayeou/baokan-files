The combination of swift, agile movements and high accuracy, the combination of superb, skillful techniques and graceful dance, can create a perfect acrobatic performance and give the audience a relaxed, pleasant, and beautiful feeling. The performances of the State Acrobatic Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic possess these characteristics. For example, the "Small Martial Arts" performed by Majigsurong, Namhai, Damjin, and Salafdaorji, just when people are attracted by those swift and agile movements and feel nervous, Majigsurong is already standing steadily on the shoulders of another actor, waving to the audience with a smile, making the audience feel relaxed, beautiful and happy. At the end of the program, she is swung into the air by an actor, as beautiful as a little swallow flying in the air. The "Aerial Chair" performed by meritorious actor Damdinsuren and others more prominently demonstrates these excellent characteristics. This aerial performance program is a development of the aerial acrobatics art. The performers are not all in the air, but two actors sit on poles at both ends of the stage, swinging the performer into the air, performing amazing tricks. The actor in the air flies from one end of the stage to the other, and in an instant can somersault two to three times in the air. Meritorious actor Damdinsuren and others perform with such accuracy and stability, and connect each trick with comedic performances and dance movements. The comedic performance sets off a relaxed and joyful atmosphere, and the dance constitutes the beauty of the program. Such a perfect acrobatic performance program makes people feel admiration and receives a warm welcome from the audience.

From the performance of the State Acrobatic Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic, we also see that what makes the acrobatic performance art even more beautiful is the art of human body modeling in the performance. Human body modeling can construct the acrobatic performance into beautiful pictures, and connect the rapidly changing tricks, making the acrobatic art a performance with skills, dance, and fascinating pictures. For example, the "Hunter and Little Bird" performed by Chengduyousi and Doorji, the hunter constantly grabs her, lifts her up, and holds her in the air, forming extremely beautiful pictures. The beauty of the image is like the prince in "Swan Lake" holding up the swan. The skillfulness of the technique makes the image lifelike, like a real eagle being caught by a hunter and lifted into the air. Each picture formed by the human body modeling has the artistic conception of sculptural beauty. This program truly achieves a performance program that combines skills, dance, and modeling. It is not only an excellent acrobatic program, but also a very good dance drama program. The successful performance of Chengduyousi and Doorji reflects the wit and bravery of the Mongolian hunters. From their performance, we can see that acrobatic art is not only limited to technical performance, but can also reflect rich content through performance.

The performances of the State Acrobatic Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic all possess the above characteristics, and each program is full of power. From their performances, we can see that they have absorbed the nutrition of the acrobatic art of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, enriched their own performances, and created acrobatic art with Mongolian national style. Their excellent performances reflect the happy and joyful life of the Mongolian people and show the strong and brave character of the Mongolians.

We thank the State Acrobatic Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic for performing in our capital twice. Their performances not only brought great pleasure to the vast audience in the capital, but will also enrich our acrobatic art.

    蒙古兄弟的杂技艺术
    张梦庚
    迅速、敏捷的动作和高度的准确性相结合，精湛、纯熟的技巧和优美的舞蹈相结合，才能构成一个完美的杂技表演节目，才能给予观众以轻松、愉快而又美的感受。蒙古人民共和国国家杂技团的表演节目就具备了这些特点。如：玛吉格苏荣、那姆海、达姆金、萨拉夫道尔日表演的“小武术”，正当人们被那些迅速、敏捷的动作吸引，感到紧张的时候，玛吉格苏荣早就稳稳的站在另一个演员的肩上，向观众微笑着招手，使观众的心情又轻松下来，感到优美而愉快。节目结束时，她被一个演员抡飞在空中，就像一只小燕在空中飞翔一样的美。功勋演员达姆丁苏伦等表演的“空中坐椅”更突出的表现了这些优秀的特点，这个空中表演节目，是发展了空中飞人的表演艺术，表演的演员不是都在空中，而是两个演员坐在舞台两端的竿子上，把表演的演员抡飞到空中，表演着使人惊奇的花样，在空中的演员从舞台的这端飞到另一端，一刹那间可以在空中翻两个至三个跟斗，而功勋演员达姆丁苏伦等表演的是那样的准和稳，而又以滑稽表演和舞蹈动作衔接着每个花样的变化，滑稽表演烘托出了轻松、愉快的气氛，舞蹈构成了节目的优美，这样完美的杂技表演节目使人感到钦佩，受到观众热烈的欢迎。
    从蒙古人民共和国国家杂技团的表演中，使我们也看到了构成杂技表演艺术更美的，是表演中的人体造型艺术，人体造型可以把杂技表演构成美丽的画面，把迅速变化的花样贯串起来，使杂技艺术成为既有技巧，又有舞蹈，又有引人入胜的画面。如：成达尤乌斯、道尔吉表演的“猎人与小鸟”，猎人不时的把她抓住托起，举在空中构成了极美的画面，形象的美，好像“天鹅湖”中王子举起了天鹅，技巧的纯熟使形象逼真，好像一只真鹰被猎人抓住举到空中。每个人体造型所构成的画面，都很有雕塑艺术美的意境。这个节目真正达到了技巧、舞蹈、造型相结合的表演节目，它不但是个很优秀的杂技节目，应该说是一个很好的舞剧节目。成达尤乌斯、道尔吉成功的表演，反映出了蒙古猎人的机智，勇敢的性格，从他们的表演中使我们看到杂技艺术，不只是限于技术的表演，也可以通过表演反映出丰富的内容。
    蒙古人民共和国国家杂技团的表演节目，都具备了以上的特点，每个节目都充满着力量，从他们表演节目中看到，他们是吸取了苏联及其他兄弟国家杂技艺术的营养，丰富了自己的表演并创造了具有蒙古民族风格的杂技艺术。他们优秀的表演，反映出了蒙古人民幸福、愉快的生活，显示了蒙古人坚强、勇敢的性格。
    我们感谢蒙古人民共和国国家杂技团两次来我们首都表演，他们的表演不但给首都广大观众带来了极大的愉快，并且将会丰富了我们的杂技艺术。
