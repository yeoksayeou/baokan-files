Xinhua News Agency report from Beirut: United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld arrived in Beirut on the afternoon of September 9th from Amman and began talks with Albert Moukheiber, the acting foreign minister of the Chamoun government, on the 10th. Hammarskjöld is in Lebanon and Jordan to arrange the withdrawal of U.S. and British invasion troops, according to the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly.

The Chamoun puppet clique does not welcome Hammarskjöld's arrival. According to Western news agencies, the Chamoun clique expressed "coldness" towards the UN Secretary-General's visit. Newspapers controlled by the Chamoun clique's Phalange party and others also attacked Hammarskjöld, clamoring for the U.S. to not withdraw its troops. The "Al-Nahar" even used "Hammarskjöld Go Home" as its editorial title. These signs indicate that the Chamoun clique is acting shamelessly under the command of the United States, attempting to delay the implementation of the United Nations General Assembly resolution so that the American invasion troops can be stationed in Lebanon for a long time.

Meanwhile, U.S. troops in Lebanon began exercises in the Jubayl area north of Beirut on the 10th. The navy, air force, and army participated in the exercises.

A batch of fighter planes was also transferred from the Adana Air Force Base in Turkey to participate in the exercise.

When Hammarskjöld arrived in Beirut, the Beirut newspaper "Al-Telegraph" published an open letter to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld from a group of Lebanese patriots. The letter stated: We are representatives of different social, political, and religious circles in Lebanon. We ask you, the head of the United Nations, to pay attention to and support the demands of the vast majority of the Lebanese people.

You already know from the report submitted by the United Nations observer group sent to Lebanon that the crisis in Lebanon is purely an internal crisis... You have been to Lebanon several times and talked with many politicians. Undoubtedly, you should confirm that Western countries' intervention in Lebanese affairs not only cannot solve the crisis but also deepens the national disaster. The situation became more complicated after the U.S. troops landed in Lebanon. The landing of U.S. troops undermined Lebanon's independence and sovereignty. Americans in Lebanon began to act like true occupiers. American soldiers occupied the main strategic strongholds and roads in Lebanon, and they even searched Lebanese people and checked their identity cards, etc., in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon.

All of this is an insult to the national sentiment and dignity of the Lebanese people. In addition, American soldiers brought many private goods to Lebanon, which damaged our country's economy.

The U.S. military command's attempt to establish an atomic weapons base in Lebanon is particularly disturbing to us. This base will constantly threaten all the Lebanese people.

Mr. Hammarskjöld, you know very well that the landing of U.S. troops in Lebanon has been condemned by people of all countries. This condemnation is expressed in the resolution unanimously adopted by the Arab countries at the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.

We firmly demand the complete implementation of this resolution, because this resolution allows us to enjoy sovereignty and national independence.

We demand that the United States troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and hope that you will carefully consider our request. We clearly and publicly declare that if the American occupation forces do not leave Lebanon immediately, we will take up arms to fight against these occupation forces.

It is reported that during his two-day stay in Jordan, Hammarskjöld held several meetings with Hussein, the puppet king of Jordan, and Prime Minister Rifai. The Jordanian puppet regime also used the excuse of first obtaining so-called "concrete guarantees of Jordan's independence" to refuse to have the British invasion troops withdraw.

Lebanese Deputy Speaker Halazli said on the 9th that the Arab League focused on two issues: first, the West must prove its sincerity with actions rather than words, and second, U.S. and British troops must withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

    黎巴嫩爱国人士写信给哈马舍尔德
    美军再不撤退就享以铁拳
    阿拉伯联盟坚持美英军队必须撤出黎巴嫩约旦
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：贝鲁特消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德9日下午从安曼到达贝鲁特，10日开始同夏蒙政府的代理外交部长艾伯特·穆希贝尔会谈。哈马舍尔德是根据联合国大会决议到黎巴嫩和约旦安排美英侵略军的撤出的。
    夏蒙傀儡集团不欢迎哈马舍尔德的到来。据西方通讯社报道说，夏蒙集团对联合国秘书长的荏临表示很“冷淡”。由夏蒙集团的长枪党等控制的报纸也对哈马舍尔德进行攻击，叫嚷不要美国撤军。“晚报”甚至以“哈马滚开”作为它的社论标题。这些迹象表明，夏蒙集团正在美国的指挥下耍无赖，企图以此拖延执行联合国大会的决议，使美国侵略军能够长期盘踞黎巴嫩不走。
    同时在黎巴嫩的美国军队10日开始在贝鲁特以北的朱贝勒地区举行演习。参加演习的有海军、空军和陆军。
    从土耳其的亚达那空军基地还调来一批战斗机参加了这次演习。
    在哈马舍尔德到达贝鲁特的时候，贝鲁特的“电讯报”刊载了黎巴嫩一群爱国者写给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的一封公开信。信中说，我们是黎巴嫩不同社会、政治和宗教界的代表，我们要求您，联合国的负责人，重视和支持我们绝大多数黎巴嫩人民的要求。
    您已经从联合国派到黎巴嫩的观察团所提出的报告中知道，黎巴嫩的危机纯粹是内部的危机……您来过黎巴嫩好几趟，并且和许多政界人士交谈过，无疑，您应当确认，西方国家干涉黎巴嫩事务不仅不能解决这个危机，反而加深了民族灾难。美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆之后，局势变得更加复杂了。美军的登陆破坏了黎巴嫩的独立和主权。美国人在黎巴嫩开始以真正的占领者的姿态进行活动。美国士兵占领了黎巴嫩国内主要的战略据点和道路，他们甚至在黎巴嫩的首都贝鲁特对黎巴嫩人进行搜查，检查他们的身份证等等。
    所有这一切都是对黎巴嫩人的民族感和尊严的侮辱。此外，美国兵带了许多私货来黎巴嫩，这样就破坏了我国的经济。
    美军司令部企图在黎巴嫩建立原子武器基地，这特别使我们感到不安。这个基地将使全体黎巴嫩人民经常受到威胁。
    哈马舍尔德先生，您知道得很清楚，美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆受到了各国人民的谴责。这种谴责表现在联合国大会紧急会议上一致通过的阿拉伯国家的决议之中。
    我们坚决要求彻底实现这个决议，因为这个决议使我们能够享有主权和民族独立。
    我们要求美国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩，并希望您仔细考虑我们的这项要求。我们明白和公开地声明，如果美国占领军不立即离开黎巴嫩，我们就将拿起武器来同这些占领军进行斗争。
    据报道，哈马舍尔德在约旦逗留的两天中，曾经同约旦的傀儡国王侯赛因和首相里法伊进行了多次会谈。约旦傀儡政权也以要先取得所谓“具体保证约旦独立”的条件作为借口，拒绝要英国侵略军撤走。
    黎巴嫩副议长哈拉兹利9日说，阿拉伯联盟着重讨论了两个问题：第一是要西方用行动而不是用讲话来证明它的诚意，第二是美英两国军队必须撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
