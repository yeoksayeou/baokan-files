    Don't Let Potatoes Rot

    Editor's Note: The situation reflected in this reader's letter, although occurring in individual regions, should attract the attention of Party and government leading organs and agricultural cooperatives in various places. This year, the planting area of ​​potatoes in our country has increased greatly. According to preliminary estimates, the total output will increase by about three times compared with last year. Therefore, it is a very important political task to make preparations as early as possible to ensure that the harvested potatoes are properly stored.

    Recently, it has been discovered in Jianchang and other counties in Liaoning that some potatoes have deteriorated. According to statistics from seven townships in Jianchang County, 230,000 jin of potatoes have rotted, and the situation is more serious in Shifo Township, where the rotted potatoes account for 14.9% of the total output. The reasons for the spoilage are mainly poor storage, insufficient preparation before the potato harvest, small warehouses, and too many potatoes. In addition, it is also caused by ideological paralysis. For example, some agricultural cooperatives believe that: the cooperative has established a flour mill this year, so it doesn't matter if some rot, it can be ground into flour. I think this is a serious problem. I suggest that agricultural cooperatives in various places strengthen the storage of potatoes to prevent spoilage.

    别让土豆霉烂
    编者按：这封读者来信中所反映的情况，虽然发生于个别地区，但应引起各地党政领导机关和农业社的重视。今年我国薯类种植面积大增，据初步估计总产量将比去年增产三倍左右，因此及早做好准备工作，保证把丰收的薯类保存好是十分重要的政治任务。
    最近辽宁建昌等县发现有部分土豆有变质的现象。据建昌县七个乡的统计，土豆霉烂的达二十三万斤，情况较严重的石佛乡土豆霉烂的占总产量14.9％。霉烂变质的原因主要是保管不善，土豆收获前准备工作作的不够，仓库小，土豆多。另外也由于思想麻痹所造成的。如有的农业社认为：今年社里已建立起粉房了，烂点不要紧，可以磨粉。我认为这是一个严重问题，建议各地农业社加强对土豆保管工作，防止霉烂变质。锦州专署监察处　高瑞
