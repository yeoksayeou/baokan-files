Xinhua News Agency, September 19th -- Leading cadres of various arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are going deep into companies and widely opening up "experimental plots." It has become a new trend for officers and soldiers to eat, live, work, operate, and entertain together. These "experimental plots" have not only powerfully promoted various tasks but also played an important role in strengthening the relationship between officers and soldiers, military-civilian relations, and improving leadership style.

According to incomplete statistics from nine units including Beijing, Nanjing, and Guangzhou, a total of 6,770 "experimental plots" were cultivated in the first half of the year. Among the 2,796 "experimental plots" in five units including Nanjing, 898 were cultivated by leaders above the division level and leading organs, covering military training, political work, political and cultural education, engineering operations, logistics work, and administrative management, almost including all tasks of the troops.

After the widespread cultivation of "experimental plots" in various units, a new atmosphere has emerged in various tasks of the troops. When Cao Zhongnan, director of the political department of a certain unit, led a work team to cultivate an "experimental plot" in the first company of a certain tank regiment, he discovered through investigation that the company had great potential, shattered the conservative ideas of some cadres with facts, and promoted the revision of the leap forward targets throughout the regiment. Tan Fafu, a leading cadre of a certain unit, personally led a class in the "experimental plot" to climb a steep cliff of 32 feet high, creating experience and enabling the troops to smoothly conduct training through the cliff. When the work team of a certain artillery unit of the Lanzhou area troops cultivated an "experimental plot" in the seventh company, they found that Wang Changyou, a seventh gunner of the second platoon, had learned the actions of each gunner in eight noon breaks under the teaching of the platoon leader, becoming an "all-around gunner." They immediately summarized the experience and launched an "all-around gunner" movement in the entire unit. In just two months, the "all-around gunner" rate of the entire unit reached 96%.

Through conducting "experimental plots," the relationship between officers and soldiers in various units is close and seamless. When He Yunfeng, political commissar of a certain division, and Zhang Huamin, deputy division commander, went to the company to cultivate "experimental plots," they put on soldiers' uniforms and lived with the soldiers. They engaged in military training together, including crawling, rolling, and fighting. Deng Guizong, political commissar of a certain anti-aircraft artillery regiment, and Zhang Manqing, deputy regiment commander, ate, lived, operated, worked, and entertained with the soldiers in the "experimental plot." Some logistics ministers even worked as cooks in the canteen. The soldiers were very moved by the excellent work style of the leading cadres, and they expressed that the leaders, at such an old age, share joys and hardships with us, so we should work harder a hundred times. Through cultivating "experimental plots," the work style of the organs has also greatly changed, with "more of two things and fewer of two things" everywhere (more going deep into the company, more on-site meetings, fewer people sitting in the office, fewer documents issued). In the past, it was "no business, no going to the company," but now it has become "no business, no returning to the organ."

### 了解战士感情　改进领导作风  解放军军官深入连队种试验田

    了解战士感情　改进领导作风
    解放军军官深入连队种试验田
    新华社19日讯　中国人民解放军各兵种部队领导干部深入连队，遍开“试验田”之花，军官和士兵同吃、同住、同劳动、同操作、同娱乐已经成为一种新的风气。这些“试验田”，不仅有力地推动了各项工作，而且对密切官兵关系、军民关系，改进领导作风起了重要作用。
    据北京、南京、广州等九个单位的不完全统计，上半年共种“试验田”六千七百七十处，其中南京等五个单位的两千七百九十六处“试验田”中，师以上领导干部和领导机关种的有八百九十八处，内容有军事训练、政治工作、政治文化教育、工程作业以及后勤工作、行政管理等，几乎包括了部队各项工作。
    各部队广泛种“试验田”以后，部队各项工作出现了新的气象。某部政治部主任曹中南率领工作组到某坦克团一连种“试验田”时，通过调查摸底，发现了连队潜力很大，用事实打破了某些干部的保守思想，推动全团修订了跃进指标。某部领导干部谭发夫在“试验田”里，亲自带领一个班，爬登三丈二尺高的陡崖，创造了经验，使部队顺利地进行了通过绝壁的训练。兰州地区部队某炮兵部队工作组在七连种“试验田”时，发现二排七炮手王长友在排长包教下，用八个中午休息时间，学会了各个炮手的动作，成了“全能炮手”。他们立即总结了经验，在全部队开展了“全能炮手”运动，仅仅两个月的时间，全部队“全能炮手”达96％。
    通过搞“试验田”，各部队的官兵关系密切无间。某部师政委何云峰、副师长张化民下连种“试验田”时，穿上士兵的服装，和士兵生活在一起。共同摸、爬、滚、打进行军事训练。高射炮某团政委邓贵宗、副团长张满清在“试验田”里，和士兵同吃、同住、同操作、同劳动、同娱乐，还有的后勤部长到食堂当炊事员。士兵们对领导干部这种优良作风非常感动，纷纷表示首长这样大年纪，和我们同甘共苦，我们更应该百倍苦干。通过种“试验田”，机关作风也大为改变，到处是“两多两少”（深入连队多，现场会议多，坐办公室的人少，发文件少），过去的无事不下连，现在成为无事不回机关了。
