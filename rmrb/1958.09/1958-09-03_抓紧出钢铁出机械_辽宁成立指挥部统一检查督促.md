　　Seize Steel and Machinery Production
　　Liaoning Establishes Command Post for Unified Inspection and Supervision

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 2nd (Reporter Chen Ji) reports: Based on the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has adopted effective measures, calling on the people of the entire province to work hard for one hundred and twenty days to resolutely complete the leap forward tasks of steel, smelting equipment, and rolling mill equipment production this year.

Liaoning Province bears an extremely important and arduous responsibility in ensuring the realization of the great task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel nationwide this year. This year, the planned steel production in Liaoning accounts for more than 44% of the country's total steel production. Thousands of sets of blowers, blast furnace equipment, and small and medium-sized rolling mill equipment must be supplied to the whole country in a timely manner according to national plans. Therefore, whether Liaoning can complete the national plan ahead of schedule is related to whether the national steel production leap forward plan can be completed, and it is related to whether China's socialist industrialization can develop at a high speed in the future. Based on the instructions of the Central Committee, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China once again emphasized: It is imperative to regard the completion of this year's national plan as a major political task, it is imperative to take steel as the key to ensure speed and ensure key points, and it is imperative to strengthen collaboration, help each other, and jointly take responsibility for completing the national plan with the communist spirit of selflessness and dedication.

As early as August 23, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China established a command post led by the secretaries of the Secretariat to seize steel and machinery production, conducting weekly inspections and supervisions; and dispatched five working groups to major industrial cities to discover and solve new problems that arise in steel and machinery production. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee also emphasized: Party committees of cities such as Anshan, Shenyang, Benxi, and Dalian must grasp production every day; party secretaries, factory directors, workshop directors, and branch secretaries of key factories and mines must move to the site and live there, fighting for steel together with the workers and masses.

Currently, Liaoning Province is resolving the problem of insufficient raw material supply based on the principle of ensuring key points. The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to prioritize the supply of steel to metallurgical equipment with the communist spirit of collaboration, and requires Anshan Iron and Steel to promptly supply the steel needed for ironmaking equipment from September 1st, in accordance with the national approved allocation plan, to ensure the needs of metallurgical equipment production in various places. Factories manufacturing metallurgical equipment must manufacture all smelting and rolling mill equipment in advance according to national requirements, ensuring that not a single unit is missing and not a single piece is lacking. Secondly, it is necessary to vigorously solve the problem of insufficient electricity, and it is decided to mobilize the entire people to save electricity and run electricity, and it is necessary to specifically arrange electricity consumption plans, and the first priority is to fully guarantee the electricity consumption for steel and machinery production. The third is to solve the problem of insufficient transportation capacity. The Provincial Party Committee promptly organized forces to establish a provincial transportation coordination group, mobilizing all means of transportation, eliminating transportation backlogs within a time limit, and meeting the transportation requirements for steel and machinery production. Anshan, Benxi, Fushun and other places have transferred hundreds of their own railcars to the railway system to enhance transportation capacity. All localities and units have also mobilized their own cars and trailers to support national transportation tasks and ensure the transportation needs for steel and machinery production.

The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee believes that because Liaoning is an important industrial base in China, Liaoning's industry must face the whole country and must support all parts of the country with the spirit of communist collaboration. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee decided that under the arrangement of the unified national plan, Liaoning must resolutely guarantee that all tasks assigned to Liaoning by various parts of the country are completed on time, without a single unit missing or a single piece lacking.

　　抓紧出钢铁出机械
　　辽宁成立指挥部统一检查督促
    据新华社沈阳2日电　记者陈迹报道：中共辽宁省委根据党中央政治局扩大会议的精神，采取有效措施，号召全省人民苦战一百二十天，坚决完成今年钢铁和冶炼设备及轧钢设备的生产跃进任务。
    辽宁省在保证实现全国今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的伟大任务中，担负着极其重大的艰巨的责任。今年辽宁计划生产的钢铁，占全国钢铁总产量44％以上。成千套的鼓风机、高炉设备和中小型轧钢设备，都要按照国家计划及时地供应给全国。因此，辽宁能否提前完成国家计划，关系着全国钢铁生产大跃进计划能否完成，关系着今后我国社会主义工业化能否高速度地发展。中共辽宁省委根据中央的指示，再次强调：必须要把完成今年国家计划看成是重大的政治任务，必须要以钢为纲来保证速度保证重点，必须要以共产主义的舍己为人的精神，加强协作，互相帮助，共同负责完成国家计划。
    中共辽宁省委早在8月23日就成立了由书记处书记领导的抓钢铁、抓机械生产的指挥部，每周进行检查和督促；并且派出五个工作组，到主要工业城市发现和解决钢铁、机械生产中出现的新问题。同时省委还强调要求：鞍山、沈阳、本溪、旅大等城市市委都要天天抓生产；各重点厂矿党委书记、厂长、车间主任和支部书记都要搬到现场去住，和职工群众一道为钢铁而战。
    目前辽宁省正在根据保证重点的原则，解决原材料供应不上的问题。省委要求各地以共产主义的协作精神，优先把钢材供应冶金设备，并且要求鞍钢从9月1日开始，迅速地按照国家批准的调拨计划，及时供应炼铁设备所需要的钢材，保证各地冶金设备生产的需要。制造冶金设备的工厂必须按照国家要求，提前制成全部冶炼、轧钢设备，要一台不少、一件不差。其次是大力解决电力不足的问题，决定发动全民节电、全民办电，必须具体地安排用电计划，首先要完全保证钢铁、机械生产的用电。第三是解决交通运输能力不足的问题。省委及时组织力量，成立全省运输协作小组，调动所有运输工具，限期消除运输积压现象，满足钢铁、机械生产的运输要求。鞍山、本溪和抚顺等地，都调出几百辆自有的车皮，交给铁路系统，增强运输能力。各地、各单位自有的汽车、拖车也都动员出来，支援国家运输任务，保证钢铁、机械生产对于运输的需要。
    辽宁省委认为，由于辽宁是我国重要的工业基地，辽宁工业必须面向全国，必须以共产主义协作精神支援全国各地。因此，省委决定：在国家统一计划的安排下，全国各地要求辽宁担负的任务，辽宁都必须坚决保证一台不少、一件不差地按时完成。
