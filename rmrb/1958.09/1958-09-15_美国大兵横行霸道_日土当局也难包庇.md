Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 14th: Tokyo news: The director of the Criminal Bureau of the Japanese Police Agency, Tokuji Nakagawa, and the head of the Saitama Prefectural Police Headquarters, Hisashi Sogabe, after investigating the case of American soldier Rumprey's unprovoked shooting and killing of Japanese university student Yoshiyuki Miyamura at the Johnson Base in Saitama Prefecture, finally decided today that the case should be handled according to the criminal law as "death caused by gross negligence." It will be transferred to the Kawagoe Branch of the Urawa District Public Prosecutor's Office on September 15.

The attitude of American soldiers towards Japanese people's lives as trifles has not changed in the slightest. According to Japanese newspapers on the 13th, at the very Johnson Base where Rumprey shot and killed Miyamura, an American sergeant named William Beal was drunk on the evening of September 11. When he heard his dog barking wildly at a Japanese person passing by, he randomly fired shots from his home, frightening the Japanese neighbors.

Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, September 14th: Ankara news: A court in Izmir, western Turkey, sentenced two American sailors to ten months in prison on the 13th for tearing up the Turkish flag.

These two American sailors got drunk a few days ago and brazenly climbed onto the statue of Kemal Ataturk, the first president of the Turkish Republic, and tore down the Turkish flag on it.

    美国大兵横行霸道
    日土当局也难包庇
    据新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本警察厅刑事局长中川董治13日同埼玉县警察本部部长曾我部久在经过调查以后今天最后决定，美国兵朗普雷在埼玉县约翰逊基地无故枪杀日本大学生宫村祥之的暴行应按刑法“因严重过失造成死亡罪”来处理，并且将在9月15日把这一案件移送浦和地方检查厅川越支部。
    美国兵把日本人民生命当做儿戏的态度迄今丝毫没有改变。据日本报纸13日报道，就在朗普雷枪杀宫村祥之的这个约翰逊基地，一个叫做威廉·比耳的美国军曹9月11日晚上喝得醉眼蒙胧，当他听到他的狗在对过路的日本人狂吠的时候，他就在他的家里胡乱开枪，使得四邻的日本人都惊慌起来。
    据新华社14日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其西部伊兹密尔的法庭13日把撕毁土耳其国旗的两名美国水兵判处了十个月徒刑。
    这两个美国水兵是日前喝醉了酒以后，放肆地爬到土耳其共和国第一任总统凯末尔的雕像上，把上面的土耳其国旗撕了下来。
