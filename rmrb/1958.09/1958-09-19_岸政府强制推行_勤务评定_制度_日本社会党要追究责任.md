Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 17th: The Japan Socialist Party held a meeting of its Chairman and Bureau Directors today, deciding that the party will pursue the responsibility of the Nobusuke Kishi government for forcibly pushing through the "Performance Appraisal" system within the Education Committees of both the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet. They will also consider submitting a motion of no confidence against Minister of Education Hirokichi Nadao during the extraordinary session of the Diet.

During the nationwide joint struggle against the "Performance Appraisal" system on September 15th, the Kishi Nobusuke government dispatched a large number of police to suppress the protests, illegally arresting Kojima Hiroshi, the Vice-Chairman of the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations (Zengakuren), and others who participated in the demonstration in Tokyo. They also beat reporters from the "Tokyo Shimbun," "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," and "Yomiuri Shimbun" who were covering the event. In Ibaraki Prefecture, the police also arrested a reporter who was covering the demonstration, as he was filming plainclothes police officers beating demonstrators.

Twenty representatives of Zengakuren sat in front of the Ministry of Justice overnight on the evening of September 15th, demanding the release of Kojima Hiroshi and others arrested that day, as well as the eight students arrested on September 8th.

The "Tokyo Shimbun," "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," and "Yomiuri Shimbun" have already filed lawsuits today against the police for their violent acts of illegally beating reporters. The Tokyo Federation of the Japan Federation of Newspaper Workers' Unions and the Press Club have also lodged protests with the Metropolitan Police Department.

    岸政府强制推行“勤务评定”制度
    日本社会党要追究责任
    据新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天举行的委员长、局长会议决定，社会党将在日本国会参众两院的文教委员会内追究岸信介政府对强制推行“勤务评定”制度所应负的责任，并且还要考虑在国会临时会议上对文部相滩尾弘吉提出不信任案。
    9月15日日本全国各地进行反对“勤务评定”制度的联合斗争时，岸信介政府出动了大批警察进行镇压，非法逮捕了在东京参加示威游行的全日本学生自治会总联合会副委员长小岛弘等二人，并且殴打了在现场进行采访活动的“东京新闻”、“日本经济新闻”和“读卖新闻”的记者。茨城县的警察还逮捕了采访示威游行情况的一名记者，他当时正在拍摄便衣警察殴打游行示威群众的场面。
    全日本学生自治会总联合会的二十名代表15日晚上彻夜坐在法务省前面，要求释放当天被捕的小岛弘等和在9月8日被捕的八名学生。
    “东京新闻”，“日本经济新闻”和“读卖新闻”等三家报纸今天已经对警察非法殴打记者的暴行提起诉讼。日本新闻工会联合会东京地方联合会和记者俱乐部也先后向警视厅提出抗议。
