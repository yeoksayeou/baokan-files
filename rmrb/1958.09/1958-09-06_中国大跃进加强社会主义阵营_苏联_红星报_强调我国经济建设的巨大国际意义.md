Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 5th. The Soviet newspaper "Red Star" published an article on September 4th entitled "The Great Leap Forward," introducing the situation of China's Great Leap Forward.

The article stated that the phrase "Great Leap Forward" expresses the main situation of the 600 million Chinese people today. That is, striving to build socialism in the shortest historical period and make the country one of the world's advanced industrial powers.

The article pointed out that only nine years after the founding of the country, the Chinese people put forward the slogan of catching up with Britain. This speed of development is unimaginable in any capitalist country. Catching up with Britain is part of the policy of realizing the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. China has already realized the socialist transformation of industry and agriculture. The socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts last year created political and economic preconditions for the Great Leap Forward. Now the Chinese Communist Party is calling on the entire people to implement the policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

When mentioning China's policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale industrial construction, the article wrote that the economic rationality of doing so is very obvious. Enterprises do not require large investments, and the return on investment is very fast. Small enterprises are also close to raw materials and consumption, thus having considerable economic effects. Chinese comrades pointed out that the characteristic of steel development in the Second Five-Year Plan is to greatly increase the number of enterprises, widely build enterprises throughout the country, and increase the variety of products. It is very obvious that China will be able to surpass Britain in steel production in just a few years, not fifteen years.

The article emphasized that the Chinese working people, inspired by the prospects of industrialization, are accomplishing miracles of high labor enthusiasm. The labor achievements of the fraternal Chinese people are a source of joy and inspiration for the entire socialist camp. China's Great Leap Forward in building socialism further strengthens the strength of the socialist camp. This is the great international significance of China's economic construction.

　　中国大跃进加强社会主义阵营
    苏联“红星报”强调我国经济建设的巨大国际意义
    新华社莫斯科5日电　苏联“红星报”4日登载了一篇题为“大跃进”的文章，介绍中国大跃进的情况。
    文章说，大跃进这句话表现了中国六亿人民今天生活的主要情况。这就是努力在最短的历史时期内建成社会主义，使国家进入世界先进工业强国的行列。
    文章指出，刚刚建国九年，中国人民就提出了赶上英国的口号，这种发展速度是任何一个资本主义国家所难以想像的。赶上英国是实现技术革命和文化革命方针的一部分。中国已经实现了对工农业的社会主义改造。去年在思想战线和政治战线上的社会主义革命又给大跃进创造了政治的和经济的前提。现在中国共产党号召全民实行多快好省的建设方针。
    在提到中国工业建设的大中小结合的方针时，文章写道，这样做在经济上的合算是很显然的。企业不需要大投资，投资的收回又很快。小企业还接近原料和消费，因而有不小经济效果。中国同志指出，第二个五年计划发展钢铁的特点是大大增加企业数量，在全国各地广泛建设企业，并增加产品的种类。非常明显，中国不要十五年，而只要几年就能够在钢铁生产方面赶过英国。
    文章着重说，为工业化的前景所鼓舞的中国劳动人民正在完成着劳动热情高涨的奇迹。兄弟的中国人民的劳动成就是整个社会主义阵营欢欣鼓舞的泉源。中国建设社会主义的大跃进，更加加强了社会主义阵营的力量。这就是中国经济建设的巨大国际意义。
