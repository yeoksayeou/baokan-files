Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 1st. Vietnamese Democratic Republic Deputy Prime Minister Truong Chinh spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter today regarding the current situation in the Taiwan Strait, saying that the grave situation in the Taiwan Strait was created by U.S. imperialism. After launching armed intervention in the Middle East, U.S. imperialism then instigated and assisted the Chiang Kai-shek clique, using the military bases of Jinmen and Matsu to intensify their provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait, making the situation in this region tense. The aim of these provocative actions is to oppose the People's Republic of China, threaten peace in the Far East and the world, and at the same time to divert world public opinion, which is resolutely opposing the U.S.-British imperialist conspiracy of aggression against the Middle East. The government and people of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic cannot but be concerned about the current tense situation in the Taiwan Strait created by U.S. imperialism.

Truong Chinh said that Jinmen and Matsu, like Taiwan, are all Chinese territory. Liberating Jinmen and Matsu, like liberating Taiwan, is China's internal affair. The Chinese people have every right to do so. U.S. imperialism has no right to interfere.

Truong Chinh said that the government and people of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic enthusiastically support the resolute actions taken by the government of the People's Republic of China against the provocations and challenges of U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. At the same time, they resolutely demand that U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam and withdraw its invading troops from South Korea, and demand that the U.S. and Britain not delay withdrawing their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

Truong Chinh concluded by saying, "We firmly believe that the 600 million fraternal Chinese people, who have the sympathy and strong support of peace-loving people in Asia and throughout the world, will surely win victory in this just struggle and recover all their territory. We also firmly believe that Vietnam and Korea will surely be reunified, and the people of the Arab countries will surely achieve complete liberation."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 1st. Vietnam's "People's Daily" published an editorial today, stating that Jinmen, Taiwan, and other islands along the Chinese coast are inseparable parts of Chinese territory. Liberating Jinmen from the clutches of the Chiang Kai-shek clique is entirely China's internal affair, and no foreign country has the right to interfere.

The editorial denounced Dulles's shameless intimidation of the Chinese people and Eisenhower's clamor that the so-called "situation in the Taiwan Strait seriously threatens the tranquility of the United States." The editorial asked, "Why is it said that the Chinese people liberating their own territory more than 9,000 kilometers from the American coast is a threat to the tranquility of the United States?"

The editorial emphasized that the United States' occupation of Taiwan, the transportation of missiles into Taiwan, and now the intensifying concentration of naval and air forces in Taiwan are precisely the reasons why the situation in this region is serious. "People's Daily" said that there is only one way to resolve this serious situation: the United States must withdraw its troops from the Taiwan area and not interfere in China's internal affairs.

    越南副总理长征发表谈话
    全世界支持中国正义斗争
    越南“人民报”斥责艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯敌视中国的疯狂叫嚣
    新华社河内1日电　越南民主共和国政府副总理长征今天就台湾海峡目前局势对新华社记者发表谈话说，台湾海峡目前的严重局势是美帝国主义制造出来的。美帝国主义在对中近东发动武装干涉之后，接着就唆使和协助蒋介石集团，利用金门和马祖的军事基地来加强它们在台湾海峡的挑衅行动，使得这个地区的局势紧张起来。这些挑衅行动的目的是反对中华人民共和国，威胁远东和世界和平，同时想转移正在坚决反对美英帝国主义对中近东的侵略阴谋的世界人民的舆论。越南民主共和国政府和人民不能不关心由美帝国主义制造出来的台湾海峡目前的紧张局势。
    长征说，金门、马祖同台湾一样，都是中国的领土。解放金门、马祖同解放台湾一样，是中国内部的事情。中国人民完全有这种权利。美帝国主义没有权利加以干涉。
    长征说，越南民主共和国政府和人民热烈支持中华人民共和国政府对美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的挑衅和挑战的行动所采取的坚决的措施。同时，坚决要求美帝国主义滚出南越和从南朝鲜撤出它的侵略军队，并且要求美英不得拖延从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军。
    长征最后说，我们坚信，得到亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的同情和有力支持的六亿兄弟的中国人民在这个正义的斗争中一定会取得胜利，收回自己的全部领土。我们也坚信越南和朝鲜一定会统一，阿拉伯各国人民一定会获得完全的解放。
    新华社河内1日电　越南“人民报”今天发表社论说，金门、台湾和中国沿海其他岛屿是中国不可分割的领土，把金门从蒋介石集团的魔掌中解放出来，完全是中国的内部问题，任何外国不得干涉。
    社论斥责杜勒斯对中国人民的无耻恫吓和艾森豪威尔的所谓“台湾海峡的局势严重地威胁美国的安宁”的叫嚣。社论问道，中国人民解放离美国海岸九千多公里的自己的领土，为什么把这说成是威胁美国的安宁呢？
    社论强调指出，美国侵占台湾、把导弹运入台湾，现在又正在加紧把海空军力量集结到台湾来，这些正是这个地区局势之所以严重的原因。“人民报”说，要解除这种严重局势只有一个办法，就是美国必须从台湾一带撤军，不得干涉中国的内政。
