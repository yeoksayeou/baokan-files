Xinhua News Agency, September 7th—The White House issued a statement after U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower convened the National Security Council on the 6th. In this statement, the U.S. authorities actually equated the serious crime of aggression, in which the U.S. used armed forces to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and attempted to expand its aggression in the Taiwan Strait area, which seriously violates the norms of international law, with the purely internal affair of the Chinese people exercising sovereignty to liberate their own territory. Moreover, it absurdly described the Chinese people liberating their own territory as "using armed forces to achieve territorial ambitions." The White House statement also completely distorted the facts and forcibly shifted the responsibility for the U.S. interruption of the Geneva talks onto China. The full text of the White House statement is as follows:

The President, along with members of the National Security Council, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, discussed the situation in the Taiwan Strait. Also present were the Director of the U.S. Information Agency, the Director of the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization, and the Acting Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. The Vice President was unable to attend due to a prior engagement.

They considered measures that would be consistent with the policies articulated by the Secretary of State on September 4th on behalf of the President. However, particular attention was paid to the reported statement by Mr. Zhou Enlai, broadcast via radio, in which he indicated that “in a renewed effort to maintain peace,” the Chinese Communists are prepared to resume ambassadorial talks with the United States. These talks, which have been conducted in Europe for several years, were recently interrupted by the Chinese Communists.

To date, the United States has not received any official communication on this matter. However, we hope that Mr. Zhou Enlai's reported statement is a response to the proposals made in our September 4th policy statement, which argued that "territorial ambitions should not be achieved by armed force," although such a renunciation of force does not necessarily require abandonment of claims, or abandonment of pursuing policies by peaceful means. This is a course that the United States will steadfastly follow, in accordance with our own vital interests, our treaty obligations, and the principles that underlie world order.

The United States has sought to implement this policy in past ambassadorial talks with the Chinese Communists. On July 28, 1958, and thereafter, we have sought to resume these talks.

If the Chinese Communists are now willing to respond, the United States welcomes this decision. The U.S. Ambassador in Warsaw stands ready to meet immediately with the Chinese Communist Ambassador there—who previously handled this matter—on this issue.

Naturally, in these resumed talks, the United States will adhere to the negotiating stance it originally adopted in 1955, which is that in these talks we will never participate in any arrangement that would prejudice the rights of our ally, the Republic of China.

### 白宫声明颠倒黑白  把美国侵略行为同我国行使主权相混淆  表示愿意恢复谈判又说不改变顽固态度

　　白宫声明颠倒黑白
　　把美国侵略行为同我国行使主权相混淆
　　表示愿意恢复谈判又说不改变顽固态度
    据新华社7日讯　美国总统艾森豪威尔在6日召开了国家安全委员会之后，发表了一项白宫声明。在这项声明中，美国当局竟然把美国用武装力量侵占中国领土台湾并企图在台湾海峡地区扩大侵略的严重破坏国际法准则的侵略罪行，同中国人民行使主权解放自己领土的纯粹内政问题，混淆起来，并且荒谬地把中国人民解放自己的领土说成是“用武装力量实现领土野心”。白宫声明还完全歪曲事实，硬把美国中断日内瓦谈判的责任转嫁在中国身上。白宫的声明全文如下：
    总统同国家安全委员会委员、国务卿、财政部长、国防部长和参谋长联席会议主席讨论了台湾海峡局势。在座的还有美国新闻署署长、民间和国防动员署署长和中央情报局代理局长。副总统因为早就有约会外出，未能参加。
    他们考虑了将会符合于国务卿奉总统之命在9月4日所阐述的政策措施。但是特别注意到的是所传周恩来先生通过电台发表的声明，其中表示，“为了再一次进行维护和平的努力”，中国共产党人准备同美国恢复大使级会谈。这个在欧洲进行了几年的会谈，最近为中国共产党人所中断。
    到现在为止，美国还没有接到关于这个问题的任何官方消息。但是我们希望，所传周恩来先生的声明是对我们9月4日的政策声明中所提主张的响应；我们的声明主张“不应当用武装力量来实现领土野心”，虽然这样放弃武力不一定就得放弃要求，或放弃用和平方法奉行政策。这是美国按照我们的切身利益、我们的条约义务和作为世界秩序的基础的原则而将坚决遵循的方针。
    美国已经在过去和中国共产党人所举行的大使级会谈中谋求执行这个政策。在1958年7月28日以及其后，我们曾经谋求恢复这个会谈。
    如果中国共产党人现在愿意响应，美国欢迎这个决定。美国驻华沙大使随时准备立即同中国共产党驻那里的大使——以前在这个问题上是他进行的——会晤。
    自然，在这个恢复的会谈中，美国将坚持它原来在1955年所采取的谈判态度，这就是，在这个会谈中我们决不参加会损害我们的盟国中华民国的权利的任何安排。
