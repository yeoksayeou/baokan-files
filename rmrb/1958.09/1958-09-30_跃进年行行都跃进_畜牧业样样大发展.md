Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: The red flag of the Great Leap Forward is flying high on the animal husbandry production front. This year, the nation's livestock will achieve tremendous growth.

The growth rate of all kinds of livestock has accelerated significantly this year. During the First Five-Year Plan, large livestock such as cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys increased by an average of only 1.85% per year, sheep and goats increased by 9.8%, and pigs increased by 10.2%. The growth rate in the first half of this year has already exceeded the past. Since July, the development of various livestock has been advancing at an even faster pace. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, by the end of this year, excluding culling, large livestock will increase by about 8% compared to the end of last year, sheep and goats will increase by about 25%, and pigs will increase by about 72%.

The reason for ensuring the rapid growth of various livestock is that all localities have strengthened breeding work. In order to strive for a great leap forward in animal husbandry, especially to reverse the slow development of large livestock, since this spring, a mass-based, continuous livestock breeding and reproduction movement has been launched across the country under the battle cry of "all mate, all conceive, all produce, all live." In this movement, localities selected and raised a large number of breeding males and built many new breeding stations (points). According to statistics from eight provinces and regions, including Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Guangxi, the number of breeding bulls kept this year has reached more than 175,000.

Due to the strengthening of livestock breeding work in various localities, the conception rate of adult female livestock has greatly increased this year. In the past, the average annual conception rate of adult female livestock in agricultural and pastoral areas across the country was only 30%-40%. The number of non-pregnant female livestock in agricultural areas was even higher, with about 80% remaining non-pregnant each year in northern regions and 60%-70% in southern regions. This situation has fundamentally changed this year. According to recent statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, 62.4% of adult female cattle, horses, and donkeys across the country are now pregnant. The leap forward in agricultural areas is even more significant. More than 80% of adult female livestock in five provinces and regions, including Henan, Hebei, Hunan, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia, have successfully conceived, making them "full-pregnancy provinces (regions)." According to another statistic, 506 counties across the country have achieved full pregnancy of female livestock. As localities have strengthened the care of pregnant livestock, the incidence of miscarriage has greatly decreased. Many regions have achieved full production and full survival. According to recent statistics from 25 provinces (autonomous regions) and cities (excluding Liaoning and Jilin provinces), 8,341,000 young animals have been added since the beginning of the year, accounting for about 10.5% of the total number of large livestock at the end of last year in these regions.

The "all mate, all conceive, all produce, all live" movement has also promoted the development of sheep and goats. In the past, the conception rate of female sheep was relatively high, but the mortality rate of lambs was high. This year, many regions have changed this situation. When ewes gave birth to lambs in the spring, most pastoral cooperatives in provinces and regions such as Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang established lambing groups, equipped with full-time lamb protection staff, and built lamb sheds or warm circles. Therefore, the lamb survival rate was above 90%, and many regions achieved full production and full survival. In addition, the sheep improvement work in various localities has also developed rapidly.

The increase in the number of pigs is the result of the vigorous implementation of the principle of collective breeding as the main method and self-breeding and self-raising in various localities. According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of the year, the number of sows raised by agricultural cooperatives in 19 provinces and cities, including Hunan, Henan, Anhui, Fujian, and Hebei, accounted for 13.7% of the total number of pigs in these regions. The increase in sows has created conditions for reproduction, so pig development has been rapid in many regions. The average number of pigs per household in provinces (regions) and cities such as Anhui, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Shanghai has already exceeded the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) for 1967.

Another important factor ensuring the great development of various livestock is that localities have strengthened the prevention and control of livestock diseases, and the epidemic prevention team has developed into a million-strong army. The mortality rate of various livestock such as cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, sheep, and pigs due to disease has been greatly reduced.

In order to ensure the further development of livestock, localities have paid attention to feed silage work this year. At present, according to incomplete statistics from 16 provinces and cities, more than 54 billion jin of feed silage have been stored, an increase of more than 11 times compared to the 4.4 billion jin last year.

    跃进年行行都跃进
    畜牧业样样大发展
    据新华社29日讯  大跃进的红旗在畜牧业生产战线上迎风招展。今年全国各种牲畜都将获得巨大发展。
    今年各种牲畜的增长速度比过去大大加快。在第一个五年计划期间，牛、马、骡、驴等大牲畜平均每年只增长1.85％，山、绵羊增长9.8％，猪增长10.2％。今年上半年的增长速度已经超过了过去。从7月以来，各种牲畜的发展正以更高的速度前进。据农业部预计，到今年年底，除淘汰外，大牲畜将比去年年底纯增8％左右，山、绵羊将增加25％左右，猪将增加72％左右。
    保证各种牲畜能够迅速增长的原因，是各地都加强了配种工作。为了力争畜牧业大跃进，特别是为了扭转大牲畜发展缓慢的现象，从今春以来全国各地在“全配、全准、全产、全活”的“四全”战斗口号下，掀起了一个群众性的持续进行的牲畜配种繁殖运动。在这个运动中，各地选养了大量种公畜，新建了许多配种站（点）。仅据河南、山东、安徽、江西、浙江、贵州、广东、广西等八个省、区统计，今年养留的种公牛即达十七万五千多头。
    由于各地加强了牲畜配种工作，今年大牲畜中成年母畜的配种怀胎率大大增加了。过去，全国农、牧业区平均大牲畜中的成年母畜每年怀胎的只有30％—40％。农业区母畜空怀的更多，北方各地每年都有80％左右空怀；南方各地也占60％—70％。今年这种情况从根本上改变了。据农业部最近统计，全国牛、马、驴等大牲畜中已有62.4％的成年母畜怀胎。农业区跃进得更为显著。河南、河北、湖南、陕西和内蒙古等五个省、区，80％以上的成年母畜都已配准怀胎，成了“满怀省（区）”。另据统计，全国还有五百零六个县实现了母畜满怀。由于各地对孕畜加强了养护，孕畜流产现象大大减少。很多地区做到了全产全活。据二十五个省（自治区）、市（缺辽宁、吉林两省）最近统计，从年初以来已增加幼畜八百三十四万一千头，占这些地区去年年底大牲畜总头数约10.5％。
    “全配、全准、全产、全活”运动也推动了山、绵羊的发展。过去，母羊配种怀胎率是比较高的，但羔羊死亡的较多。今年很多地区改变了这种情况。青海、内蒙古、新疆等省、区的牧民们，在母羊春季产羔时，绝大多数牧业社都成立了接羔组，配备了专职保羔员，搭了羊羔棚或暖圈，因此，羔羊成活率都在90％以上，很多地区达到了全产全活。另外，各地的绵羊改良工作也发展的很快。
    生猪头数的增加，是各地大力贯彻集体饲养为主，自繁自养方针的结果。据不完全统计，上半年湖南、河南、安徽、福建、河北等十九个省、市，农业社饲养的母猪已占这些地区生猪总头数的13.7％。母猪增加，就为繁殖创造了条件，因此很多地区生猪发展很快。安徽、广西、四川和上海等省（区）、市平均每户有猪头数已经超过了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）1967年的要求。
    保证各种牲畜大发展的另一重要因素，是各地加强了牲畜疫病的防治工作，防疫队伍已经发展成为百万大军。牛、马、骡、驴、羊、猪等各种牲畜因病死亡率大大降低。
    为了保证牲畜的进一步发展，今年各地注意了饲料青贮工作。目前，据十六个省、市不完全统计，已青贮饲料五百四十多亿斤，比去年的四十四亿斤增加了十一倍多。
