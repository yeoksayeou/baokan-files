The "Great Northern Wilderness" Successfully Experiments with Winter Sowing of Spring Wheat

(Our dispatch) The "August 52nd" and "August 53rd" state-owned farms of the Mishan Reclamation Bureau in Heilongjiang Province have broken the old convention that spring wheat cannot be sown in winter in the "Great Northern Wilderness," and have created a large-scale high-yield experience of winter sowing of spring wheat and sowing of winter wheat. This has opened up a path for Heilongjiang Province to implement two harvests a year or three harvests in two years. The Ministry of Agricultural Reclamation recently held an on-site meeting in the Mishan Reclamation Area to promote this experience.

Heilongjiang Province has always sown spring wheat due to the severe winter climate. However, every spring when the ground thaws, there is a lot of rain and the ground is muddy, and the sowing time is very short, which often cannot guarantee the quality of sowing, thus affecting the yield. Some employees of the August 52nd Farm began experimenting with winter sowing of spring wheat in the winter of 1956. At that time, some people with conservative ideas said: "Even some agricultural colleges have not succeeded in their experiments in the past, you should stop wasting seeds!" However, with the support of the farm's Party committee, they broke through the shackles of conservative thinking and sowed when the ground temperature had already dropped before the land was about to freeze. In this way, sowing too early and the seeds germinating and emerging from the soil being frozen to death were avoided. In 1956, one hectare was sown, and in 1957 the sowing was expanded to 828 hectares, all of which were successful. The winter-sown spring wheat had large ears, many grains, and plump kernels, with a yield of generally 3,400 to 3,800 jin per hectare, an increase of about 30% compared to spring-sown wheat, and the maturity period was also advanced by seven or eight days. The Gangzi Commune in the suburbs of Qiqihar City has also successfully experimented with winter sowing of spring wheat for three consecutive years. The August 53rd Farm tried planting winter wheat last winter, which matured about fifteen days earlier than spring wheat and yielded 35% more than spring wheat.

Implementing winter sowing of spring wheat and sowing winter wheat can not only ensure increased wheat production, but also advance the wheat sowing period, ease the tension of spring operations, and ensure timely sowing and careful cultivation of large fields. At the same time, winter-sown wheat matures earlier, which can avoid the failure to achieve a good harvest due to rain during the harvest period. After harvesting the wheat, it is also possible to plant late autumn crops such as flax, buckwheat, silage corn, early-maturing potatoes, and vegetables, as well as green manure, thereby gradually realizing a cropping system of two harvests a year or three harvests in two years.

### “北大荒”试验春麦冬播成功

    “北大荒”试验春麦冬播成功
    本报讯  黑龙江省密山农垦局“八五二”和“八五三”两个国营农场打破“北大荒”不能冬播小麦的陈规，创造出春麦冬播和播种冬麦的大面积丰产经验。这为黑龙江省实行一年两收或两年三收开辟了道路。农垦部最近在密山垦区召集的现场会议上，推广了这个经验。
    黑龙江省因冬季气候严寒，历来都播种春小麦。但是每到春季大地解冻时期，雨多地烂，播种时间非常短促，往往不能保证播种质量，从而影响产量。八五二农场部分职工在1956年冬季就开始试验春麦冬播。当时一些有保守思想的人说：“过去有的农学院都没有试验成功，你们还是趁早别糟蹋种子吧！”可是他们在农场党委支持下，冲破了保守思想的束缚，在土地即将封冻之前，地温已经降低的时候播种。这样，就避免了播种过早，种子发芽出土被冻死。1956年播种一公顷，1957年扩大播种八百二十八公顷，都获得成功。冬播春麦穗大、粒多、颗粒饱满，每公顷产量一般达到三千四百到三千八百斤，比春播小麦的产量提高30％左右，成熟期也提早七、八天。齐齐哈尔市郊岗子社连续三年试验春麦冬播也同样成功。八五三农场去冬试种冬小麦，比春小麦提早十五天左右成熟，比春小麦增产35％。
    实行春麦冬播和播种冬麦不仅可以保证小麦增产，而且可以提早小麦播种期，缓和春季作业的紧张状态，保证大田按时播种和精耕细作。同时冬播小麦成熟期较早，可以避免因收割期多雨造成丰产不能丰收。收麦后还可以种亚麻、荞麦、青贮玉米、早熟马铃薯、蔬菜等晚秋作物和压绿肥，从而逐步实现一年两收或两年三收的耕作制度。
