　　II. The Radiance of "Golden Star" (Continued from yesterday)
    How is the technological revolution going in this cooperative? You can get a general idea from the cooperative's technological innovation exhibition room. This exhibition room is attached to the cooperative's Technical Research Committee. As soon as we entered the exhibition room, we were attracted by the models and charts that filled the room. Although these models are made of simple materials such as lead wire, sorghum stalks, old cardboard boxes, old tin cans (such as cigarette cans or other tinplate cans), they are made so exquisitely and can rotate and move. The charts are well drawn, and the explanations are concise and clear. A technician in his thirties gave the explanation. This person is unassuming, but after listening to his explanation of several models, I felt that he not only had a considerable amount of technical knowledge, but also had a basic knowledge of physics. He explained things in a simple and understandable way. There are a total of forty or fifty models and charts in the room, some of which have been put into practical use, and some are still being tested and modified. After seeing them, I asked the technician's name and learned that he was Zhao Guozhang, who had suggested the most innovations and made the most inventions, and was also one of the five teachers at the amateur agricultural university.
    Later, I learned that this Comrade Zhao Guozhang had only studied in junior high school for two or three years, but he has always liked to engage in these "toys", but he also had backward aspects with insufficient drive. The rectification movement changed him, and now he has great enthusiasm. The cooperative's rectification exhibition room has a description of his transformation.
    The rectification exhibition room is divided into two parts. The first part is the Golden Star Cooperative before the rectification, using pictures and text to expose the serious waste, bureaucratic work style, backward thinking and actions, etc.; the second part is the plan, which is a plan for developing production, improving culture, and improving life (including cultural entertainment) formulated after the mass opinions were solicited and integrated during the great blooming and contending. They have already started to build a two-story club, and are saving materials to build new houses for the members one after another. Both of these have models. The model of the houses shows a great improvement in living conditions, but the cost of each unit is very cheap. According to the model, the characteristics of these new houses are hygiene, practicality, comfort, and non-wasteful. This new housing plan will be implemented this year, but how many can be built in the first batch depends on how many bricks the brick factory can produce.
    The last part of the exhibition is a sand table model of the "Golden Star Cooperative after Ten Years". What kind of scale is this? There is a hospital (the current clinic, together with the maternal and child health station, has three doctors, both Chinese and Western medicine), schools, sanatoriums, factories, a meteorological observatory, and a water tower (for self-provided tap water); the club is in the center of the Central Avenue square, and the schools, hospitals, and residential areas are distributed in the apple orchard (actually a forest), and there are also plans to open several ponds, so that the entire area is decorated like a park.
    To be honest, this sand table model intoxicated me. When they asked me to leave a few words when I left, I wrote these four sentences: Visiting the Golden Star Cooperative, my heart is really happy; I am willing to be a member, and jointly build a paradise on earth. I wish the Golden Star Cooperative's ten-year long-term plan can be completed ahead of schedule. This is based on the following two reasons: one, the cooperative's existing foundation and the enthusiasm of the members. Second, the new atmosphere and enthusiasm of the rapid leap forward in the whole country, especially in Heilongjiang Province. The two are indispensable and interdependent, and there is also the principle of "everyone for me, and me for everyone" here. To give an immediate example: the Golden Star Cooperative's ten-year plan requires mechanization, which is related to the ambitious plan proposed by the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee to basically realize agricultural mechanization within five years. Heilongjiang Province has now mechanized more than 460 agricultural cooperatives (this is done by adopting the form of agricultural machinery cooperatives owned and operated by the cooperatives), and its plan to realize mechanization within five years will definitely be completed, thus ensuring that the Golden Star Cooperative's ten-year plan can definitely be completed.

　　二、“金星”的光芒（续昨）
    这个社的技术革命搞得怎样呢？可以从该社的技术革新陈列室看到大概面目。这个陈列室附属于该社的技术研究委员会。我们一进那陈列室，首先就被满室的模型和图表所吸引。这些模型虽然是用铅丝、秫秸、旧纸盒、旧铁罐（例如香烟罐或其他马口铁制的旧罐）等等简易的材料做的，可是做得这样精致，能转能动。图表呢，画的也好，说明也扼要而明白。有一位三十来岁的技术员作解释。此人其貌不扬，可是听他解释了几件模型之后，我就觉得他不但有相当高的技术知识，而且也有物理学的基础知识。他讲的深入浅出。全室的模型和图表共有四、五十件，有些已经实际应用了，有些还在试用和继续修改。看完后，我问这位技术员的姓名，才知道他就是建议革新最多、发明最多的赵国章，也就是业余农业大学的五位教师之一。
    后来，据了解，这位赵国章同志也不过读过二、三年初中，可是一向喜欢搞这些“玩艺儿”，但也有干劲不足的落后方面，整风运动把他改变了，现在劲头很大。该社的整风展览室就有关于他的转变的描写。
    整风展览室分为两部分，第一部分是整风以前的金星社，用图画和文字逐项揭露那些严重的浪费、官僚主义作风、落后的思想行动等等；第二部分是规划，就是大鸣大放后综合群众意见制定的发展生产、提高文化、改良生活（包括文化娱乐）等计划。已经着手要建筑一座二层楼的俱乐部，并且正在储蓄材料要陆续建造社员的新住宅。这两项都已有了模型。住宅的模型表示居住条件的大大提高，然而每个单元的造价却很便宜。照模型看来，这些新住宅的特点是卫生、实用、舒适而不浪费。这个新住宅的计划，今年就要实行，但第一批能建多少，却要看砖厂能出多少砖方能决定。
    展览的最后部分是“十年后的金星社”的沙盘模型。这是怎样一个规模呢？这就有医院（现在的医务所，连同妇幼保健站有三个大夫，中西医都有）、学校、休养所、工厂、气象观测台、水塔（自备自来水用的）；俱乐部在中央大街广场的中心，学校、医院、住宅区分布在苹果园（实在是林子）中，而且还计划开几个池塘，整个地区点缀得公园似的。
    说实在话，这个沙盘模型使我陶醉。临走时他们要我留下几句话，我写的是这样四句：参观金星社，心里真欢喜；愿作一社员，共同建设人间乐园。我预祝金星社的十年远景规划一定可以提前完成。这是根据下列两个理由：一，该社现有的基础和社员们的干劲。二，全国的尤其是黑龙江省的一日千里跃进的新气象和干劲。两者缺一不可而又相因相成，这里也有“人人为我，我为人人”的道理。举一个眼前的例子：金星社的十年计划需要机械化，这就和黑龙江省委所提出的五年内基本上实现农业机械化的雄心规划有关系。黑龙江省现在已经有四百六十多个农业合作社机械化了（这是采取了农业机械社有社营的形式的），它的五年内实现机械化的规划一定能够完成，因而也保证了金星社的十年规划一定能够完成。（未完待续）
