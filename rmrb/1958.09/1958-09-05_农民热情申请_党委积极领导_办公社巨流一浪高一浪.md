Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 3rd: As of September 2nd, Fujian Province has established more than 130 people's communes.

When the first batch of people's communes in Fujian Province were being piloted, agricultural scientific research institutions and state-owned farms located in rural areas were unified and deployed together. The established people's communes mainly take three forms: one is the merger of several small cooperatives into a large commune; one is the devolution of agricultural scientific research institutions located in rural areas to the local people's communes, becoming a part of the commune; and one is the construction of people's communes based on state-owned farms and absorbing the surrounding small cooperatives.

The benefits of establishing people's communes are attracting the vast number of peasants like a magnet. Within three days, 98% of peasant households in Nan'an County had signed up to apply for the establishment of people's communes.

After agricultural cooperation, Fujian Province universally carried out the merging of townships and the linking of cooperatives to meet the needs of large-scale production development, implemented the "five cooperatives in one" system of agriculture, supply and marketing, credit, handicrafts, and transportation cooperation, and universally established mass organizations such as rural canteens and nurseries, which greatly developed agricultural production and created extremely favorable conditions for the establishment of people's communes.

Shandong
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 4th: The movement to establish people's communes has initially formed a high tide in Shandong Province. As of the end of August, more than 120 people's communes have been built throughout the province, and more than 220 are under construction. Counties such as Linyi, Shouzhang, Fanxian, Tengxian, Junan, Yishui, Zou County, and Laiwu have already achieved people's communeization.

With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and the rapid improvement of peasants' awareness, it has become an urgent demand of the broad masses of peasants in Shandong Province to develop existing agricultural cooperatives to a higher level to adapt to and promote the development of productive forces. Many areas began to plan the merger and expansion of cooperatives more than a month ago. Since Chairman Mao's inspection in Shandong and his instruction that "it is better to run people's communes," the movement to establish people's communes has rapidly formed a high tide in many areas. Thousands of peasants enthusiastically applied to join the people's communes with gongs and drums. Party committees at all levels stood at the forefront of the movement with enthusiasm, actively leading the masses to move forward. In the process of building communes, all localities universally launched a great debate on whether to establish people's communes, what the advantages of people's communes are, and how to run people's communes well. People happily said: The benefits of the commune are endless, the wishes of many years have been realized, and a happy life is in sight.

All localities have paid attention to closely combining the establishment of people's communes with current production. In order to welcome the birth of the people's commune, the peasants of Zou County launched a vigorous movement to accumulate fertilizer and topdress, accumulating more than 5 billion jin of fertilizer every day. On the first day of the establishment of the people's commune in Chengguan Town, Shanxian County, 15,000 laborers were organized, and 1,500 carts were dispatched to transport all 220 million jin of fertilizer to the fields in one day and night, and topdressing was applied to 5,100 mu of sweet potatoes.

Shanxi
Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 4th: Since the first people's commune was piloted by the agricultural cooperative led by Wu Houli, a nationally renowned agricultural labor model in Pinghun County, Shanxi Province, in mid-August, 43 counties and suburban districts, including Pinghun and Jieyu, have achieved people's communeization so far. Other counties are also actively merging cooperatives and transforming them into communes. According to the recent deployment of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the specific plans of various localities, more than 20,000 agricultural cooperatives throughout the province will be merged and transformed into 800 to 1,000 people's communes. Before the autumn harvest, the entire province will achieve people's communeization.

After the rectification and socialist education movement in the vast rural areas of Shanxi Province, especially the propaganda and implementation of the General Line, not only was the political and ideological awareness of the peasants unprecedentedly improved, but also a new situation of great leaps forward appeared in all aspects of production. In the three major transformations of nature (water conservancy, soil and water conservation, and afforestation) and the people's running of industry, mutual assistance and cooperation in human, material, and financial resources were universally carried out between townships, cooperatives, industry, and agriculture. From the great collaboration, the communist ideology of the broad masses of peasants was further strengthened and improved. Public canteens, sewing, farm tool repair, and grain processing plants have been universally established in various places. After the great leap forward, rural cadres not only enriched their experience in leading agricultural production, but also learned the ability to comprehensively lead industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. All these have laid a sufficient ideological and material foundation for running people's communes.

The superiority of the people's commune has been initially demonstrated after the establishment of the commune. The members happily said: The establishment of the commune has led to a great leap forward in production, which is truly a double happiness.

Hubei
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 4th: The peasants of Hubei Province, who have achieved bumper harvests of summer crops and early and mid-season rice, are very enthusiastic about running people's communes. As early as July and August, some counties' agricultural cooperatives automatically merged; recently, peasants in various places have been beating gongs and drums and submitting applications and declarations of determination to the leading organs in groups. Echeng County alone has received 400,000 declarations of determination. Members of agricultural cooperatives in the Xiangyang Special Zone have posted 1 million big-character posters and launched a great debate on issues related to running people's communes.

Party committees at all levels in Hubei Province successively held meetings in late August to actively lead this movement. At these meetings, based on the urgent demands of the peasant masses to run people's communes, preliminary plans were made and methods for studying pilot projects were formulated. Now most counties have done one or two pilot projects, and Xiangyang and Huanggang Special Zones have built 47 people's communes.

The mass movement of running people's communes is closely integrated with current production, promoting a new upsurge in agricultural production. The Hongqi People's Commune in Yingcheng County was established on August 28. By September 3, the commune had deeply plowed more than 3,000 mu of land, completed a water conservancy project capable of irrigating 8,000 mu, and also established three gypsum mines, one phosphorus mine, and built two highways.

    农民热情申请　党委积极领导
　　办公社巨流一浪高一浪
　　福建
    据新华社福州3日电　到9月2日止，福建省已办起一百三十多个人民公社。
    福建省第一批人民公社在试办的时候，是把设在农村的农业科学研究机构和国营农场统一在一起加以部署的。已办起来的人民公社主要有三种形式：一种是由几个小社合并转变为一个大的公社；一种是把设在农村的农业科学研究机构下放到当地的人民公社中，成为公社的一部分；一种是以国营农场为主吸收周围的小社，建成人民公社。
    办人民公社的好处，正像吸铁石一样吸引着广大农民。南安县三天之内就有98％的农户报名申请建立人民公社。
    福建省在农业合作化以后，为适应生产大发展的需要，曾普遍进行了并乡联社，实行农业、供销、信贷、手工业、运输合作等五社合一，并在农村中普遍建立了生产大协作制度，大办农村食堂和托儿所等群众性组织，使农业生产得以大大发展，为建立人民公社创造了极为有利的条件。
　　山东
    据新华社济南4日电　建立人民公社运动已在山东省初步形成高潮。截至8月底止，全省已经建成人民公社一百二十多个，正在建立的有二百二十多个。临沂、寿张、范县、滕县、莒南、沂水、邹县、莱芜等县已经实现了人民公社化。
    在工农业生产飞跃发展，农民觉悟迅速提高的情况下，将现有农业社向更高级的阶段发展，使之适应和促进生产力的发展，已经成为山东省广大农民群众的迫切要求。许多地区在一个多月以前，就已开始酝酿并社扩社。自从毛主席到山东视察指示“还是办人民公社好”后，建立人民公社的运动就在很多地区迅速形成高潮。成千上万的农民敲锣打鼓，热情地申请参加人民公社。各地党委满怀热情地站在运动的前列，积极领导群众前进。各地在建社过程中普遍展开了要不要建立人民公社，人民公社有什么优越性，怎样办好人民公社等题目的大鸣大放大辩论。人们高兴地说：公社好处说不完，多年的愿望已实现，幸福生活在眼前。
    各地在建立人民公社时，都注意紧密结合当前生产。邹县农民为了迎接人民公社的诞生，掀起了轰轰烈烈的积肥、追肥运动，每天积肥五十多亿斤。单县城关镇在成立人民公社的第一天，组织了一万五千名劳力，出动了一千五百辆小车，一昼夜将二亿二千万斤肥料全部运到地里，并给五千一百亩甘薯施了追肥。
　　山西
    据新华社太原4日电　山西省从8月中旬全国著名农业劳动模范平顺县武侯梨领导的农业社试办第一个人民公社以来，到目前为止，全省已经有平顺、解虞等四十三个县和市郊区实现了人民公社化。其他各县也正在积极地并社和转公社。按照中共山西省委最近的部署和各地的具体规划，全省两万多个农业社将合并转为八百到一千个人民公社。秋收以前，全省将实现人民公社化。
    山西省广大农村经过整风和社会主义教育运动，特别是总路线的宣传和贯彻，不仅农民政治思想觉悟空前提高，而且各项生产都出现了大跃进的新形势。在对自然进行三大改造（水利、水土保持、植树造林）和全民办工业中，乡与乡、社与社、工业与农业普遍进行了人力物力财力上的互助协作。从大协作当中，进一步加强和提高了广大农民群众的共产主义思想。各地普遍建立了公共食堂、缝纫、农具修配、粮食加工厂。农村干部经过大跃进的锻炼，不仅丰富了领导农业生产的经验，而且学会了工农商学兵全面领导的本领。所有这些都给办人民公社奠定了充分的思想基础和物质基础。
    人民公社优越性在建公社后已初步显示出来。社员们高兴地说：公社办起来，生产大跃进，这真是喜上加喜，双喜临门。
　　湖北
    据新华社武汉4日电　获得夏收作物和早中稻大丰收的湖北省农民，办人民公社热情很高。早在7、8月间，就有部分县的农业社自动并社；最近，各地农民更是敲锣打鼓，成群结队地向领导机关递申请书、决心书。仅鄂城县已接到的决心书就达四十万份。襄阳专区各农业社社员已经贴出大字报一百万张，对有关办人民公社的问题展开了大辩论。
    湖北省各级党委在8月下旬相继召开会议，积极领导了这个运动。在这些会议上，根据农民群众对办人民公社的迫切要求，作出了初步规划和研究试点工作的做法。现在大部分县都搞了一两个试点，襄阳、黄冈两专区已建成四十七个人民公社。
    办人民公社的群众运动紧密与当前生产相结合，促进了农业生产的新高涨。应城县红旗人民公社是8月28日成立的，到9月3日，这个公社已深翻了三千多亩地，修好一个能灌八千多亩的水利工程，还办起了三个石膏矿，一个磷矿，修好两条公路。
