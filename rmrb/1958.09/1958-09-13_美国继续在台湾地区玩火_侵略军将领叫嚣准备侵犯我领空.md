Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Taipei News: The United States continues to gather armed aggressive forces and is stepping up extremely dangerous provocations in the Taiwan Strait. According to a British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast today, jets armed with air-to-air missiles taking off from U.S. aircraft carriers are constantly patrolling areas within 20 miles of the Chinese coast. A United Press International reporter, sending news from the U.S. aircraft carrier "Midway," stated that planes from this ship are taking off day and night to make provocations. On the 11th, a jet taking off from this warship crashed and slid off the deck, killing Lieutenant Colonel Hyde, the pilot, on the spot. Clark, commander of the U.S. Navy's Task Force 77, openly clamored on the "Midway" that U.S. planes were prepared to intrude into the airspace over our Jinmen and Xiamen areas and expand the scope of aggression. He said that aircraft from U.S. Seventh Fleet aircraft carriers will "provide air cover for (Chiang gang) convoys when needed; all the way to three nautical miles from Jinmen Island."

The spokesman for the U.S. military command in Taiwan said on the 11th that the U.S. Air Force units invading Taiwan were "currently in position on Taiwan bases" and had "taken over" all responsibility for the so-called "nighttime defense of Taiwan." According to reports, the United States increased the number of F-100 jets stationed in Taiwan a few days ago. Seventy-five aircraft from the U.S. Naval Air Force arrived in Taiwan on September 8 to participate in joint U.S.-Chiang military exercises and were ordered to remain in Taiwan after the exercises ended. According to foreign news agencies, there are currently 200 to 300 U.S. jets at various airports in Taiwan, all in a state of "combat readiness." The cruiser "Los Angeles," which had just arrived from the United States, entered Keelung Port in Taipei on the 11th.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Washington News: The U.S. government, on the one hand, expressed its agreement to resume ambassadorial talks between China and the United States, but on the other hand, continues to issue war cries hostile to and intimidating the Chinese people, and further assembles troops to actively prepare to expand provocative activities against China.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles held talks with Defense Secretary McElroy, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining, and others on the 11th to discuss the situation in the Taiwan area. After the talks, McElroy told reporters that, regardless of the repeated warnings issued by the Chinese government, the United States would continuously cover Chiang Kai-shek's supply ships transporting military supplies from Taiwan to Jinmen. He also denied that this provocative behavior of U.S. warships against the Chinese people violated China's territorial waters, insisting that the United States could not accept China's claim of a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea.

On the same day, State Department spokesman White also issued a similar statement, denying U.S. acts of aggression in the Taiwan area and shamelessly slandering China as the "aggressor."

U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Bickley continued to issue belligerent shouts. He attempted to scare the Chinese people, who are determined to liberate their territory, by flaunting his outdated armed forces, saying that the Seventh Fleet currently has "the greatest strength since the Korean War" and is "ready to carry out any orders."

Clark, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet's aircraft carrier battle force, also issued provocative shouts to the Chinese people, threatening that if his planes were attacked, he would "pursue them to the Chinese mainland."

According to U.S. officials in Taiwan, U.S. troops in the Taiwan area are continuing to be strengthened. The cruiser "Los Angeles" arrived at Keelung Port in northern Taiwan on the morning of the 11th. The second U.S. jet fighter wing has also arrived in Taiwan. At the same time, it was revealed that the United States has deployed Tactical Air Command units in the area, and U.S. Air Force units stationed in Taiwan are also in a state of "alert" in order to participate in military provocations against the Chinese people at any time.

    美国继续在台湾地区玩火
    侵略军将领叫嚣准备侵犯我领空
    新华社12日讯　台北消息：美国继续结集武装侵略力量，加紧在台湾海峡地区进行十分危险的玩火挑衅。据英国广播公司今天广播，从美国航空母舰起飞的由空空导弹武装的喷气机，正在不断地在离中国海岸二十英里以内的地区巡逻。合众国际社记者从美国航空母舰“中途号”发出消息，说明这艘舰上的飞机日夜出发起飞寻衅。11日，由这艘军舰上起飞的一架喷气机失事滑出甲板，驾驶员海德中校当场毙命。美国海军第七十七特遣舰队司令克拉克在“中途号”上公然叫嚣说，美国飞机准备侵入我国金门、厦门地区领空，扩大侵略范围。他说，美国第七舰队航空母舰上的飞机“在需要时将对（蒋帮）船队提供空中掩护；一直进入离金门岛三海里的地方”。
    侵台美军司令部发言人11日说，美国侵台空军部队“目前在台湾基地上进入岗位”，并且“接管”了所谓“夜间保卫台湾的全部责任”。有消息说，美国在几天前又增加了F—一○○型喷气机驻台湾的架数。美国海军航空部队的七十五架飞机9月8日到台湾参加美蒋联合军事演习，演习结束后也奉命留在台湾不离开。据外国通讯社消息，目前在台湾各个飞机场上，有二百架到三百架美国喷气机，都处于“战斗准备状态”。刚从美国开来的巡洋舰“洛杉矶号”在11日开入台北基隆港。
    据新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府一方面表示同意恢复中美两国大使级会谈，但是另一方面却继续发出敌视和恫吓中国人民的战争叫嚣，并且进一步调集兵力，积极准备扩大对中国的挑衅活动。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯11日又同国防部长麦克耳罗伊、参谋长联席会议主席特文宁等人会谈，讨论台湾地区局势。麦克耳罗伊在会谈后对记者发表谈话时不顾中国政府三番四次提出的警告，宣布美国要不断掩护蒋介石集团的供应船只从台湾运送军用物资到金门。他还抵赖美国军舰对中国人民挑衅的这种行为侵犯了中国的领海，硬说中国关于领海宽度为十二浬的规定不是美国所能接受的。
    同一天，国务院发言人怀特也发表了内容相似的声明，抵赖美国在台湾地区的侵略罪行，反而无耻地诬蔑中国是“侵略者”。
    美国第七舰队司令比克利继续发出好战的叫嚷。他企图用炫耀已经过时的武装力量的办法来吓唬决心解放自己领土的中国人民，说什么第七舰队目前具有“朝鲜战争以来的最大实力”，而且“已经准备好执行任何命令”。
    美国第七舰队的航空母舰战斗部队司令克拉克也向中国人民发出挑衅的叫嚷，扬言他的飞机如果受到攻击，就要“追击到中国大陆”去。
    据在台湾的美国官方人士说，台湾地区的美国军队仍在继续加强。巡洋舰“洛杉矶号”11日上午已经到达台湾北部的基隆港。美国第二个喷气歼击机联队也已经到达台湾。同时，据透露，美国已经在这个地区部署了战术空军司令部的部队，驻在台湾的美国空军部队也已经处于“戒备状态”，以便随时参加对中国人民的军事挑衅行动。
