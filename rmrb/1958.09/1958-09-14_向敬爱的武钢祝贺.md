    Congratulations to the Esteemed Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation
    Yuán Zhèn, Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company
    In magnificent Wuhan, on the banks of the world-renowned and mighty Yangtze River, the No. 1 blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO), under the wise leadership of the Party and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, was put into production ahead of schedule and produced iron normally. This is a great joyous event for the Chinese people in socialist construction, a great victory that cannot but make people cheer. All the staff and workers of our Anshan Iron and Steel Company extend warm congratulations to our dear colleagues, the staff and workers of WISCO. We hail your achievements and congratulate you on your victory!
    The early commissioning of the No. 1 blast furnace represents a victory achieved under the guidance of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. It is the result of the comrades and colleagues building WISCO, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the whole country, advancing by leaps and bounds; it is the result of hard work, practical work, and great effort. All the staff and workers of our Anshan Iron and Steel Company feel great admiration for your soaring enthusiasm. We must learn from you and your unprecedented drive.
    Just as the Chinese people are working selflessly, making great leaps forward on the road of socialist construction, just as steel workers across the country are responding to the call of the Party Central Committee, fighting heroically to double steel production and to achieve a steel output of 10.7 million tons this year, and just as all peace-loving people across the country are resolutely opposing the shameless military provocations of US imperialism in the Taiwan Strait, the No. 1 blast furnace of WISCO has been put into production ahead of schedule. This is of great significance and adds new strength to the fight against the US aggressors and the liberation of Taiwan.
    All the staff and workers of our Anshan Iron and Steel Company also understand that producing one more ton of steel means adding more weight to the liberation of Taiwan and the fight against US imperialism's aggression. We are also working hard day and night under the leadership of the Party to increase steel production. We guarantee to all comrades at WISCO and to the people of the whole country that we will definitely use soaring enthusiasm to ensure the completion of our leap forward plan. At the same time, we also guarantee to our comrades at WISCO that as long as there are things you need our support for, we will certainly, in the spirit of communist cooperation, contribute our modest strength to the best of our ability.
    Today the No. 1 blast furnace of WISCO is producing iron; tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, countless No. 1 blast furnaces will be producing iron in China, and hundreds of thousands and millions of blast furnaces will be producing iron. There is no doubt that this steel will converge into the largest river in the world, sweeping US imperialism clean from the face of the earth! Let US imperialism tremble before our great Chinese people!
                                September 13, 1958

    向敬爱的武钢祝贺
    鞍山钢铁公司经理　袁振
    在雄伟的武汉，在举世闻名的浩浩荡荡的长江边上，武钢一号高炉在党的英明领导下，在苏联的无私援助下，提前投入生产，正常地出铁了。这是我国人民在社会主义建设中的一件大喜事，一件不能不叫人欢呼的大胜利。我们鞍钢全体职工谨向我们亲爱的同行武钢的全体职工同志们致以热烈的祝贺，我们欢呼你们的成就，祝贺你们的胜利！
    一号高炉提前投入生产是在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线照耀下取得的胜利；是建设武钢的同志们、同行们在党的领导下，在全国人民支援下，跃进再跃进的结果；是苦干实干大干的结果。我们鞍钢全体职工同志，对你们这种气冲云霄的干劲，感到十分的敬佩。我们一定要好好地向你们学习，学习你们这种空前的干劲。
    正当我国人民忘我地劳动，在社会主义建设的道路上大跃进的时候，正当在全国钢铁工人响应党中央的号召，为实现钢铁产量翻一番，为实现今年钢产量达到一千零七十万吨而英勇奋斗的时候，正当全国爱好和平的人民坚决反对美帝国主义在台湾海峡进行的无耻军事挑衅的时候，武钢的一号高炉提前投入生产了，这个意义是重大的，这对打击美国侵略者，这对解放台湾又增加了一份新的力量。
    我们鞍钢全体职工也同样地了解，多出一吨钢，就是为解放台湾、为反对美帝国主义的侵略多增添一份有份量的力量。我们也正在党的领导下，为了增产钢铁，日日夜夜苦战。我们向武钢全体同志，向全国人民保证，我们一定要以冲天的干劲来保证完成我们的跃进计划。同时，也向我们武钢的同志们保证，只要你们需要我们支援的事情，我们也一定本着共产主义大协作的原则，尽上我们应尽的一点微薄的力量。
    今天是武钢一号高炉出铁了，明天后天中国将有无数个一号高炉出铁，将有几十万几百万个高炉出铁。毫无疑问，这些钢铁将汇成一道世界上最大的河流，把美帝国主义从地球上冲刷得干干净净！让美帝国主义在我们伟大的中国人民面前发抖吧！
