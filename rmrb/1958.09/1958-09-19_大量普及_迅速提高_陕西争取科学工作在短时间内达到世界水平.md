Mass Popularization, Rapid Improvement
Shaanxi Strives to Reach World-Class Scientific Level in a Short Time

    (Our dispatch) Shaanxi Province, in the current stage of developing scientific undertakings, has put forward a new policy of "mass popularization, rapid improvement," striving to ensure that both the improvement and popularization of science in the province reach the world's advanced level in as short a time as possible.

    In the short span of more than three months since the establishment of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and its seven affiliated research institutes (offices), the province already has three special districts, more than forty counties (cities), and thousands of agricultural cooperatives that have also established experimental research institutions. In Fufeng County, nearly ten thousand farmers from one hundred and eighty agricultural cooperatives are participating in various experimental research projects. Science is being carried out on a large scale in the vast countryside and factories, and the province has already seen more than two hundred new achievements and new products that have reached world-class and domestic advanced levels. Therefore, the previously proposed gradual improvement is no longer suitable for the current situation. The situation in many areas of Shaanxi Province shows that the wider the popularization of science and technology, the faster the improvement. At present, in Fenghuo Cooperative in Liquan County, where everyone is engaged in science and every individual is conducting experiments, they have three types of experimental fields, closely combining mass popularization and rapid improvement. The first type is the "cutting-edge" experimental field of the cooperative's research office, specializing in creative experimental research; the second type is the production team's experimental field, which is for further observation of the cooperative's "cutting-edge" experimental results and for demonstration; the third type is the production group's experimental field, which mainly promotes widespread high yields on a large scale based on existing mature experience.

    The fact that Shaanxi Province is carrying out mass scientific research also shows that many workers and farmers with limited book knowledge can not only popularize and promote the advanced technologies and experiences of others in production practice, but they can also completely create new miracles and break through some cutting-edge technologies. Xi Qihao, a nineteen-year-old young worker at the Xi'an Machine Manufacturing Factory, only graduated from junior high school the year before last. Recently, he created a "rapid cold phosphating" method, which reduces the phosphating time from the original fifteen to twenty minutes to two to three minutes. After investigation and verification by the Chemistry Teaching and Research Group of Xi'an Jiaotong University, this method surpasses the phosphating methods currently used in various countries around the world, increasing production efficiency by more than five times.

    In agriculture, research work such as distant hybridization of varieties, which only a few experts and professors dared to engage in in the past, is now being carried out by farmers in Liquan, Chaoyi, Chang'an, Wugong and other places. They are grafting or hybridizing cotton with roses or grapes, pumpkins with tomatoes, peas, lentils, wheat and barley with each other. Zhao Bingheng, a sixty-six-year-old member of the Sha hutuo Agricultural Cooperative in Xi'an City, used approach grafting and grafting methods to graft cotton onto Ailanthus trees, which are now flowering and bearing peaches.

    With the widespread dissemination of science and technology and the urgent needs of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, many daring workers and farmers have begun to propose applying new technologies to production. Some agricultural cooperatives in Wugong, Liquan, Weinan and other counties are conducting experiments on the industrialization and hospitalization of agricultural production. Some are injecting crops, some are using growth-stimulating hormones, and some want to use fluorescent lamps to strive for greater yields. Wang Baojing is conducting experimental research on a new discipline - "Field Design Science." He plans to completely change the original farming habits and intercropping methods, and carry out comprehensive design in all aspects of planting crops, just like building factories and mines, in order to solve the most difficult problems of ventilation and light transmission after large-scale dense planting of crops, and strive for large-scale high yields.

    In response to the above situation, Shaanxi Province has put forward a new policy of "mass popularization, rapid improvement" and various specific measures for its implementation. These measures are: this year, all townships and cooperatives, as well as factories, mines, and schools, will establish scientific research institutions, requiring that within three to two years, all townships and cooperatives in the province will have crop varieties, pesticides, agricultural implements, a set of cultivation techniques, and their own weather forecasting stations suitable for their respective townships and cooperatives. Systematically summarize the production experience of their own townships and cooperatives, and compile teaching materials suitable for local amateur universities and agricultural middle schools. Teachers and students in schools, cadres in institutions, and residents in neighborhoods should all carry out scientific research work.

    In order to accelerate the development of new science and technology, Shaanxi has established four branches of the Chinese Academy of Sciences for agriculture, medicine, construction, and posts and telecommunications, and has newly built twenty-three scientific research institutes (offices) belonging to advanced and cutting-edge technologies such as electronics, computing technology, automation, and semiconductors. In this way, the province has both general science and technology institutions and cutting-edge science institutions; both grassroots organizations in special districts, counties, factories, and cooperatives, and a set of large, medium-sized, and advanced research institutions, forming a relatively complete scientific research system.

### 大量普及　迅速提高  陕西争取科学工作在短时间内达到世界水平

    大量普及　迅速提高
    陕西争取科学工作在短时间内达到世界水平
    本报讯　陕西省在发展科学事业的现阶段中提出“大量普及，迅速提高”的新方针，争取全省科学工作不论提高与普及都要在尽量短的时间内达到世界先进水平。
    陕西省在短短三个多月里，成立了中国科学院陕西分院和所属七个研究所（室）以后，全省已经有三个专区、四十多个县（市）和数以千计的农业社，也都建立了试验研究机构。扶风县有一百八十个农业社的近万名农民参加各种试验研究。广大农村、工厂都在大办科学，全省已出现了二百多项达到世界水平和国内先进水平的新成就和新产品。因此，过去提出的逐步提高已经不能适应当前形势。陕西省不少地区的情况说明，科学技术普及越广的地方，提高也越快。目前已经是人人办科学，个个搞试验的醴泉县烽火社，他们就有三种类型的试验田，把大量普及和迅速提高紧密结合起来。第一类是社里研究室的“尖端”试验田，专门从事创造性的试验研究；第二类是生产队的试验田，这是为全社“尖端”试验成果作进一步观察，并进行示范；第三类是生产小组的试验田，主要是根据已有成熟经验，在大面积上推广达到普遍丰产。
    陕西省开展群众科学研究的事实还说明：许多书本知识不多的工人农民，不仅在生产实践中推广普及别人的先进技术和经验，他们自己也完全可以创造出新的奇迹，攻破一些尖端技术，西安机器制造厂的十九岁青年工人席企浩，前年才初中毕业。最近他创造了一种“快速冷磷化”，使磷化时间由原来十五至二十分钟，缩短为二至三分钟。经西安交通大学化学教研组查定，这种方法超过了当前世界各国采用的磷化方法，提高生产效率五倍以上。
    农业上过去只有少数专家、教授敢于问津的品种远缘杂交等研究工作，现在醴泉、朝邑、长安、武功等地农民都在进行试验研究。他们把棉花和玫瑰花或葡萄、南瓜和蕃茄、豌豆、扁豆、小麦和大麦等互相嫁接或杂交。西安市沙泘沱农业社六十六岁的社员赵丙衡用靠接和接穗的办法，把棉花接在椿树上，现在已经开花结桃。
    随着科学技术的广泛传播和工农业生产大跃进的迫切需要，许多敢想敢干的工人农民已经开始提出运用新技术到生产中去。武功、醴泉、渭南等县的一些农业社，正在对农业生产工业化、医院化的问题进行试验。有的给庄稼打针，有的采用刺激生长素，有的要用日光灯以争取更大丰产。王保京正在进行一门新学科——“田间设计学”的试验研究。他计划彻底改变原有的耕作习惯和套种方法，种植庄稼也像建立厂房矿山一样进行各方面的综合设计，以解决农作物大量密植后最感困难的通风透光等问题，争取大面积的高额丰产。
    针对以上情况，陕西省提出“大量普及，迅速提高”的新方针和具体贯彻的各种措施。这些措施是：今年内所有的乡社以及厂矿、学校，都建立科学研究机构，要求三、二年内全省乡乡社社都有适合本乡本社的作物品种、农药、农具、一套耕作技术和自己的气象预报台等。系统地总结本乡本社的生产经验，编出适合当地业余大学、农业中学的教材。学校师生、机关干部、街道居民都要进行科学研究工作。
    为了加快新科学技术方面的发展，陕西成立了中国科学院农业、医学、建筑、邮电等四个分院，新建电子、计算技术、自动化、半导体等二十三个属于高级和尖端技术的科学研究所（室）。这样，全省既有一般科学技术的机构，又有尖端科学的机构；既有专区、县、厂、社的基层组织，也有了一套大中型和高级的研究机构，形成了一个比较完整的科学研究体系。
