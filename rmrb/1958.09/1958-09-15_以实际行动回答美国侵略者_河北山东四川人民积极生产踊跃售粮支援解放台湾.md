Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Telegram: In rural Hebei Province, the vast numbers of commune members are both actively engaged in production and intensifying their military training, taking practical action to support the liberation of Taiwan and oppose the American imperialists’ war provocations. In the Tangshan Special District, people's communes have already built five divisions, thirty-eight regiments, six hundred and eighty-one core militia battalions, and more than two thousand four hundred core militia companies. Women have also formed seven hundred and sixty companies. In Shangdu County of Zhangjiakou Special District, more than five thousand militiamen held a military review.

The peasants are determined to transform their anger into strength. After holding an anti-aggression demonstration rally on the 7th, the Dongxing People's Commune in Yanshan County immediately formed a force of over fifteen thousand people to plow the land, heading to the fields under the stars and plowing over one thousand mu of land in one night. In Ji County, more than fifty-seven thousand members of the Red Flag People's Commune held a protest meeting, determined to deeply plow all wheat fields in the commune to a depth of at least 1.5 chi. After hearing Premier Zhou’s statement on the evening of the 6th, commune members of the Qigou People’s Commune in Pingquan County immediately began building seven small blast furnaces overnight, ensuring iron would be produced as soon as possible. One hundred and fifty women in Dongcheng Township formed a "Steel Expeditionary Force" to mine ore at Dushan, fifty li away.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Telegram: The flames of anger against American aggression have spread throughout the cities and vast rural areas of Shandong. The Changwei Special District vowed to accelerate communization and ensure the practical actions of the "Thousand Catty Special District" to counter the aggressors. Some agricultural cooperative members in Changcheng Township, Zhucheng County, carried public grain to participate in rallies, expressing their determination to ensure the early completion of the autumn grain delivery and sale tasks to support the liberation of Taiwan. In the old revolutionary base areas of Yiyuan, Mengyin, Junan, and Cangshan in the Linyi area, a labor force of two and a half million people fought day and night, determined to deeply plow four million five hundred thousand mu of land within twenty days. Members of the five thousand three hundred and twenty agricultural cooperatives in the Huimin Special District resolved to realize communization before September 20th to strengthen the forces for the liberation of Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Telegram: The peasants of Sichuan Province, with its successive years of bumper harvests, are taking practical action to transport and sell grain quickly, in order to counter the military provocations and war threats of American imperialism.

Currently, along the grain transportation lines that crisscross the province, the vast numbers of grain and transportation workers are accelerating the task of transferring Sichuan grain to other areas. The Sichuan Provincial Grain Department has decided to transfer more than 550 million jin of grain out of the province in September, an increase of more than 20% compared to August. At the two transportation hubs of Chongqing and Chengdu, the docks and stations are piled high with grain, and workers are working day and night under the huge banner "We Must Liberate Taiwan," loading grain onto trains and ships. Recently, the province also dispatched two hundred and fifty trucks to accelerate the transportation of grain from remote areas. The transportation department of the Jiangjin Special District tapped the potential for grain transportation, using small steamships to tow barges on the turbulent Yangtze River, more than doubling the transportation volume.

At the same time, the enthusiasm of peasants across the province for selling grain is particularly high. To date, more than 3.38 billion jin of grain have been stored. After seeing Premier Zhou’s statement, peasants in Yibin, Wanxian, Fuling, and other special districts decided to hand in all public grain and sell all unified purchase grain in early and mid-September. In August, Lezhi County had already completed 94% of its grain purchase plan. After Premier Zhou’s statement was issued, members of various agricultural cooperatives sold the remaining grain to the state overnight.
