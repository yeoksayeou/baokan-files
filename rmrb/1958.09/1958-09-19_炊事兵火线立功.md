    Cook Makes Meritorious Service on the Front Lines
    Cheng Shouli
    Since the start of the battle to counterattack the Chiang bandit troops on Kinmen, cook Hu Congli has often braved artillery fire, crossed hillsides, and climbed over communication trenches to deliver meals and boiling water to the front lines. Sometimes he cooked meals near the positions, delivering the food and boiling water directly to the gun emplacements. When he delivered the food and boiling water to the soldiers, he would always offer a few kind words of comfort: "You're working hard! You're fighting so beautifully!" When moving artillery shells, he would also shout encouraging slogans: "Comrades! Aim at the enemy and hit them hard! Quickly silence the Chiang bandit artillery! We will surely win!"
    On the afternoon of August 23, the Chiang bandit troops, in their death throes, fired on our positions. Hu Congli had just returned to the shelter after delivering boiling water to the front lines, and before he could sit down, the company commander suddenly relayed an order over the phone:
    "The cooking squad is to send some men to the front lines to move artillery shells."
    "I'll go!" Hu Congli, forgetting his fatigue, stood up abruptly and was the first to volunteer.
    He and several comrades ran quickly to the positions. Others carried one shell, he carried two. Sweat streamed down his forehead like raindrops, and his clothes were soaked. But he ignored all of this, single-mindedly sending artillery shells to the gun emplacements, thinking only of silencing the enemy's artillery as soon as possible.
    Suddenly, he saw that comrades in a neighboring gun emplacement were injured, and the comrades rescuing the wounded were too busy. Without regard for his own safety, he rushed through the artillery fire and charged over, carrying the wounded Zheng Changjian quickly towards the dressing station.
    Hu Congli's heroic actions were universally praised by his comrades-in-arms, and also inspired other comrades. To commend his heroic and tenacious actions, the company awarded him a third-class merit.

    炊事兵火线立功
    成守礼
    从反击金门蒋贼军的战斗开始以来，炊事兵胡从礼常常冒着炮火，穿过山坡，爬过交通沟，把饭菜和开水送到前沿阵地，有时就在阵地附近煮饭，把饭菜和开水直接送到炮位上去。当他把饭菜和开水送到战士们手中的时候，他总要亲切地慰问几句：“你们辛苦啦，你们打得真漂亮！”在搬炮弹的时候，他还喊鼓动口号：“同志们！瞄准敌人狠狠地打呀！赶快把蒋贼炮兵打哑！我们一定胜利！”
    8月23日下午，蒋贼军垂死挣扎，向我阵地发炮。胡从礼刚从火线上送开水回到掩蔽部，还没坐定，忽然连长从电话中传来了命令：
    “炊事班抽一部分人去火线搬炮弹。”
    “我去！”胡从礼忘了疲倦，霍地站起来，头一个报了名。
    他和几个同志飞快地跑到阵地上。人家扛一颗，他扛两颗。汗水像雨点从他额上淌下来，衣服都被沾住了。但他不顾这些，一个劲地往炮位上送炮弹，他一心只想着早些把敌人的炮打哑。
    忽然，他看到邻近的炮位有同志受伤了，抢救伤员的同志忙不过来，他奋不顾身，穿过炮火，猛冲过去，背起伤员郑长健就飞快地奔向包扎所。
    胡从礼的英勇行为受到战友们普遍赞扬，也鼓舞了其他同志。为了表扬他英勇顽强的行动，连里给他记了三等功。
