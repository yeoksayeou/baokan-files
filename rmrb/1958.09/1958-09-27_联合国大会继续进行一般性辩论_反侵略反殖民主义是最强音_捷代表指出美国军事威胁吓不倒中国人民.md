Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly, after voting on the issue of Chinese representation at the afternoon session on the 23rd, continued with the general debate. The situation at the afternoon session on the 23rd and the morning and afternoon sessions on the 24th indicates that the call against aggression and against colonialism has become the mainstream of this session of the General Assembly.

Speaking at the morning session on the 24th, the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David emphasized that the main issue in international life today is whether the world will follow the path of peaceful coexistence or the path of war.

David called everyone's attention to the concentration of American armed forces in the Taiwan area of China. He emphasized that the purpose of American provocative activities is to impose America’s barbarous policy on the People's Republic of China through threats and blackmail. He said that it would be politically naive to think that military intimidation and threats can scare the great Chinese people. The Chinese people are not afraid of anyone and have taught the aggressors a good lesson more than once. The Chinese people are by no means isolated in their just struggle, they have reliable allies and loyal friends.

Speaking of the situation in the Middle East, David pointed out that the United States and Britain must obey the unanimous demands of the people of all countries and withdraw their troops from the region.

The Czechoslovak representative then spoke on the issue of disarmament, and he supported some of the suggestions made by the Soviet Union in this regard.

Representatives of newly independent nations of Asia and Africa at the meeting condemned the crimes of colonialism and denounced the American aggression and military provocations against China. The head of the Cambodian delegation, Prime Minister Sihanouk, spoke at the morning session on the 24th, citing Cambodia as an example to illustrate how neutral small countries have become victims of the "Cold War." He said that we have tried our best to show the spirit of understanding and tolerance to maintain good relations with the West and the East. But as soon as we invited experts from the People's Republic of China to help our country build, a propaganda campaign hostile to our country immediately began. We were accused of turning our country into a "base for communist infiltration."

The head of the Burmese delegation, U Thant, expressed serious concern at the afternoon session on the 24th about the possible consequences of the current international tension. He said that the United States should reconsider its Far East policy. He pointed out that the Central Government of the People's Republic of China is more stable than any Chinese government in the past century. However, some countries still stubbornly refuse to recognize this government, and some of these countries have close ties with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, which never hides its intention to change the outcome of the Chinese people's revolution and restore its position on the Chinese mainland. The Burmese representative condemned the United States for obstructing the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, saying that it is impossible to have truly effective talks without recognizing the People's Republic of China.

U Thant said that his country respects the political and social systems of other countries and resolutely pursues the principle of peaceful coexistence with other countries. He said that the Burmese delegation believes that in order to ease international tensions and establish lasting peace, armaments must be effectively and significantly reduced, and all human and material resources must be used for constructive purposes. The Burmese representative welcomed the Soviet Foreign Minister's proposal to use the funds saved from the reduction of military budgets by the four major powers to assist underdeveloped countries.

The Afghan representative, Pezhwak, expressed concern in his speech about the current situation in the Near East. He said that the United Nations should make further efforts to ensure that the resolutions of the emergency special session can be implemented.

He called for a rapid solution to the disarmament issue and supported reaching an agreement to stop nuclear weapons testing.

The Ethiopian Foreign Minister, Yilma Deressa, reminded the Assembly of the serious economic situation of many small countries and countries still striving for national independence. He emphasized that this is primarily the case in African countries, where many nations are still under colonial rule and suffering all the serious consequences of this rule.

Deressa called for not obstructing the legitimate aspirations of these people to get rid of imperialist and colonialist oppression. He said that the people of African countries have the right and should decide their own destiny.

The Ghanaian representative, Ghana's Minister of Labor and Cooperatives, Ako Adjei, emphasized that colonialism should be ended in Africa and throughout the world. He called on all countries to forever end racial discrimination and recognize the national independence and autonomy rights of all peoples.

He said that the government of Ghana is very disturbed by the situation in the Far East. He said, "We believe that China's entry into the United Nations will not only help ease the situation in the Far East, but also help ease world tensions." Speaking of the issue of disarmament, the Ghanaian representative called for a halt to the arms race, first of all a halt to the production of hydrogen bombs, and he also called for an agreement on the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing. He strongly protested the French government's plan to test thermonuclear weapons in the Sahara Desert.

Representatives from the Philippines, Turkey, and the Union of South Africa also spoke at these sessions. The representatives from the Philippines and Turkey tried their best to defend the aggressive policies of the United States and Britain, while the representative from South Africa attempted to defend the apartheid policies pursued by the South African government. Along with the powerful voices against aggression and colonialism, how repulsive and insignificant their voices seemed!

    联合国大会继续进行一般性辩论
    反侵略反殖民主义是最强音
    捷代表指出美国军事威胁吓不倒中国人民
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：联合国大会23日下午会议在就中国代表权问题进行表决后，接着又进行一般性辩论。23日下午和24日上、下午会议的情况表明，反对侵略、反对殖民主义的呼声已经成为本届大会的主流。
    在24日上午会议上发言的捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维强调指出，今天国际生活中的主要问题是，世界走和平共处的道路还是走战争的道路。
    戴维请大家注意美国武装部队在中国台湾地区集结的情况，他着重指出，美国挑衅活动的目的是用威胁和讹诈手段把美国的蛮横政策强加在中华人民共和国的头上。他说，如果以为用军事恫吓和威胁可以吓倒伟大的中国人民，那在政治上就是太幼稚了，中国人民不怕任何人而且已经不止一次地给了侵略者以很好的教训。中国人民在他们的正义的斗争中决不是孤立的，他们有着可靠的盟国和忠实的朋友。
    戴维在谈到中近东局势时指出，美英两国必须服从各国人民的一致要求，从这个地区撤出它们的军队。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表接着谈到裁军问题，他支持苏联在这方面所提出的一些建议。
    亚非民族独立国家的代表在会议上纷纷斥责殖民主义的罪行，并痛斥美国对中国的侵略和军事挑衅。柬埔寨代表团团长西哈努克首相在24日上午会议上发言，他列举柬埔寨的例子来说明中立小国如何成为“冷战”的牺牲品。他说，我们曾极力表现谅解和容忍的精神来保持同西方和东方的良好关系。但是我们一邀请中华人民共和国的专家来帮助我国建设，就立即开始了敌视我国的宣传运动。我们被指责为把自己的国家变成了“共产主义渗入的基地”。
    缅甸代表团团长吴丹在24日下午会议上，对于目前国际紧张局势可能造成的后果表示严重不安。他说，美国应当重新考虑它的远东政策。他指出，中华人民共和国中央政府比百年来任何一个中国政府都要稳固。然而却仍然有些国家顽固地拒绝承认这个政府，其中某些国家同台湾的蒋介石集团有着密切的联系，而这个集团从不掩饰它打算改变中国人民革命的结果和在中国大陆上恢复自己地位的野心。缅甸代表谴责美国阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，他说，不承认中华人民共和国就不可能进行真正有效的会谈。
    吴丹说，他的国家尊重别国的政治制度和社会制度，坚决奉行同其他国家和平共处的原则。他说，缅甸代表团认为，为了缓和国际紧张局势和建立持久和平，必须有效地和大大地裁减军备，并且使一切人力物力资源用于建设性的目的。缅甸代表欢迎苏联外交部长关于用四大国缩减军事预算节省下来的资金援助不发达的国家的建议。
    阿富汗代表佩吉瓦克在发言中对近东当前局势表示不安。他说，联合国应当再作努力使紧急特别会议的决议能够得到执行。
    他要求迅速解决裁军问题，并支持达成停止试验核武器的协议。
    埃塞俄比亚外交大臣伊勒马·德雷萨提醒大会注意许多小国和仍然在争取本国民族独立的国家的严重经济状况。他强调说，这首先是非洲国家，在那里许多民族仍然受到殖民统治和遭受着这种统治所带来的一切严重后果。
    德雷萨呼吁不要阻挠这些人民要求摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义压迫的合法愿望。他说，非洲各国人民有权和应当自己决定自己的命运。
    加纳代表、加纳劳工和合作社部长阿科·阿杰伊强调说，应当结束非洲和全世界的殖民主义。他呼吁各国永远停止种族歧视和承认各国人民的民族独立权和自治权。
    他说，加纳政府对于远东局势感到非常不安，他说，我们认为，中国进入联合国不但有助于缓和远东局势，而且有助于缓和世界紧张局势。在谈到裁军问题时，加纳代表呼吁停止军备竞赛，首先是停止生产氢弹，他并且呼吁就立即停止试验核武器问题达成协议。他坚决抗议法国政府计划在撒哈拉大沙漠试验热核武器。
    在这几次会议上发言的，还有菲律宾、土耳其、南非联邦等国代表，菲律宾和土耳其代表竭力替美英的侵略政策辩护，南非代表则企图为南非政府奉行的种族歧视政策辩护。和强大的反侵略、反殖民主义的声音在一起，他们的声音显得多么令人生厌，而且显得多么渺小啊！
