Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 13th: The Vice Chairman of the Indonesian-China Friendship Association and member of the National Council, Mrs. Rasuna, expressed her support today for the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. When interviewed by a reporter from the Chinese-language "Xin Bao" newspaper, she said, "Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory, and it is only natural for the Chinese people to recover Taiwan."

She said that just as Indonesia recovered West Irian, China's recovery of Taiwan is only a matter of time, and no force can stop this national aspiration. China has long been preparing to recover Taiwan, but it has been interfered with by the United States. She condemned the United States' despicable attempt to always start wars on the territory of other countries.

She said, "The United States has always been behind the scenes in every international activity, and the recent Middle East incident is a clear example."

In her conversation, Mrs. Rasuna said that Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region was "excellent."

When Rasuna spoke about the activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Indonesia, she said that the Indonesian National Council had warned about this issue long ago. She pointed out that the Indonesian people are well aware of the vile behavior of the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

    印度尼西亚—中国友协副主席说
    任何力量挡不住中国解放台湾
    新华社雅加达13日电　印度尼西亚—中国友好协会副主席、民族委员会委员拉苏娜夫人今天表示支持中国人民解放台湾。她在接见中文“新报”记者时说，“台湾是中国领土的一部分，中国人民收复台湾是很自然的。”
    她说，正像印度尼西亚收复西伊里安一样，中国收复台湾仅仅是一个时间问题，任何力量都阻挡不了这个民族愿望。中国老早就在准备收复台湾，但是遭到了美国的干预。她谴责美国总是想在别的国家的领土上发动战争的卑鄙企图。
    她说，“在每一个国际活动中一向都有美国在幕后捣鬼，最近中东事件是一个明显的例子。”
    拉苏娜夫人在谈话中说，中国总理周恩来发表的关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明是“极好的”。
    拉苏娜在谈到蒋介石集团分子在印度尼西亚的活动时说，印度尼西亚民族委员会早就针对这个问题提出了警告，她指出，印度尼西亚人民对蒋介石集团分子的恶劣行为知道得很清楚。
