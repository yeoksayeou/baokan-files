Looks Like a Wooden Box, But It's Actually a Generator

    In the Dengfeng County Power Plant in Henan Province, there is a very special generator. From its appearance, it looks like a large square wooden box. If no one explains it, no one would know that it is a 25-kilowatt generator, supplying electricity for the lighting of more than a thousand electric lights in Dengfeng County.

    This generator was jointly created by teachers and students from the Department of Electrical Engineering of Tsinghua University and mechanical workers from Dengfeng County. Not only is the shell made of wood, but the inside is entirely made of old iron sheets instead of silicon steel sheets. Its main shaft (rotor) also does not use high-carbon steel, but ordinary steel forged in a blacksmith shop. The insulation materials used inside are also different from ordinary ones. For example, the insulating varnish is made of tung oil, kerosene, and sand. This new insulating varnish is easier to dry than regular varnish. It dries in three hours when applied to iron sheets, while regular varnish needs to be sent to a special drying room for twenty-four hours to dry. The manufacturing method of this generator is also simpler than that of foreign generators. Except for lathes, planers, and drills that require machine tool processing, the rest is all operated with hand tools. In this way, the cost of this generator is about half lower than that of foreign generators, making it suitable for promotion in rural areas.

    When the teachers and students of the Department of Electrical Engineering of Tsinghua University designed and manufactured this motor in Dengfeng, the Dajindian District Committee of Dengfeng County sent fifteen farmers to learn from them. Now, the farmers in the Dajindian District have returned to their cooperatives and are manufacturing this type of motor.

    看来是个木盒子  实际是部发电机
    在河南省登封县发电厂里有一部很特别的发电机，从外形上看去，它像个四方的大木盒子，如果没有人作说明，谁也不会知道它是一部二十五瓩的发电机，它在供给着登封县的一千多盏电灯照明。
    这部发电机是清华大学电机系的师生和登封县的机械工人共同创造的。它不仅外壳是木制的，而且里面全用旧铁皮代替了矽钢片。它的大轴（转子）也不用高炭钢，是用普通的钢材在铁匠铺里锻出来的。它里面所用的绝缘材料也和普通的不一样，譬如绝缘的清漆，它是用桐油、煤油和砂子调成的。这个新的绝缘漆比清漆容易干燥，涂在铁皮上晾三小时就干了，而用清漆需要送进专门的烘房里烘二十四小时才能干。这部发电机的制造方法也比洋电机简单。除了车、刨和钻需要机床加工外，其余全部用手工工具操作。这样这部发电机的成本就比洋电机低一半左右，它适于在农村推广。
    清华大学电机系的师生在登封设计制造这部电机时，登封县大金店区委曾经派了十五个农民跟他们学习，现在大金店区的农民回社后已在按照这种电机进行制造。
