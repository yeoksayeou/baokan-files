Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi said today, "In this era when the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, the aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism can only tighten the noose around its own neck. If they dare to impose war on the Chinese people, then the Chinese people, with the support and assistance of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, will certainly inflict a complete defeat on U.S. imperialism."

Tonight, Soviet friends in Beijing and responsible persons from various departments of Chinese state organs held a grand friendship gathering to celebrate the ninth anniversary of our National Day. In his speech at the gathering, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi said, "After U.S. imperialism occupied Lebanon with armed forces, it recently launched military provocations and war threats against our country in the Taiwan Strait, attempting to prevent our country from liberating its coastal islands and Taiwan. The 600 million Chinese people have already given a stern and righteous response to the American aggressors. The Soviet government and the Soviet people have expressed profound sympathy and unconditional assistance and support for the just struggle of the Chinese people. This spirit of shared hatred for the enemy has given the Chinese people tremendous excitement and encouragement. The Chinese people express heartfelt gratitude for this deep fraternal friendship."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "At present, the Chinese people are concentrating all their efforts on doing a good job in their socialist construction, while also preparing conditions for the transition to communism. A tide of building people's communes is sweeping across the country. I believe that the strong Chinese people will certainly achieve the goal of building their own happy life. At the same time, in order to prevent provocations and attacks by aggressors, our Chinese people have also made a vow for the whole nation to be soldiers and everyone to practice martial arts. This means that the peace-loving Chinese people, the Chinese people engaged in peaceful construction, will never invade any country and will never allow any country to invade themselves. Defending peace and building ourselves, this is the sacred political task of the Chinese people in the current situation. It must be completed and it will certainly be completed. We are not afraid of the provocations of the aggressors. We are willing to advance together with the peace-loving people of the world. Victory belongs to the peace-loving people. This is certain. The aggressors will eventually fail. This is also certain!"

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "This year is the first year of our country's Second Five-Year Plan, and it is also a year of comprehensive leap forward in industry and agriculture under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction." "The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has set off a high tide of technical revolution and cultural revolution, promoting a comprehensive leap forward in various construction undertakings." He emphasized, "The achievements of the Chinese people in construction are inseparable from the sincere assistance given to us by the Soviet government and the Soviet people, as well as the excellent experts they have sent." "Nurtured by the great Soviet Communist Party, Soviet experts, in the spirit of internationalism, enthusiastically imparted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, used their rich scientific and technological knowledge to help us solve many major problems in construction, and cultivated a large number of professional talents for our country. These factors have played a positive role in the great leap forward of our country's socialist construction. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I once again express my heartfelt thanks to you." Vice Premier Chen Yi also said, "We must continue to humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and from the excellent Soviet experts working in our country."

Then, Antonov, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, made a speech full of friendly passion. He began by saying, "Today, we are gathered together like members of a united and loving family to celebrate a day of extremely great significance – the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Please allow me to take this opportunity to warmly congratulate Chinese and Soviet comrades, and to congratulate you on the upcoming great holiday we share – the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China."

In his speech, Antonov strongly expressed the full support of the entire Soviet people for the just struggle of the Chinese people. He said, "Not long ago, Comrade Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet government, declared that an infringement by the imperialists on our great friend, ally, and neighbor, the People's Republic of China, is an infringement on the Soviet Union. Loyal to its obligations, our country will do everything possible, together with the People's China, to safeguard the security of the two countries, to safeguard the interests of peace in the Far East, and to safeguard the interests of world peace. This statement expresses the will of the entire Soviet people. For this reason, this statement has received a warm response throughout our country and has been unanimously supported by workers, peasants, intellectuals, and Soviet soldiers."

Antonov said, "The Chinese people have every right to recover their territory and can be sure that the words of the Soviet people supporting China are firm and reliable. We have no doubt that the Chinese people will victoriously resolve all tasks related to the Taiwan area."

In his speech, Antonov warmly congratulated the Chinese people on their great victories in socialist construction. He said, "Dear comrades! The Chinese working people are greeting the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in a great political and labor upsurge. They are showing the world how much talent the hard-working and ingenious people who have thrown off the yoke of imperialism possess. It is no exaggeration to say that every day of the ordinary Chinese people's daily hard work demonstrates mass heroism. When the Soviet people and the working people of all other socialist countries hear about China's high-yield agricultural production and the magnificent plans for developing the steel industry, the machine-building industry, the power industry, and other industrial sectors, they feel very proud of their Chinese brothers and enthusiastically hope to be able to give you – our dear friends – more and more help."

Antonov also said: With the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendship and cooperation between our two countries has entered a new and higher stage of development. The positive foreign policy pursued by our two countries, based on the friendship and peace of all nations, has shattered the imperialist conspiracy to launch a new world war. We fully agree with the vivid analogy made by our Chinese friends regarding the current international situation: "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind."

Antonov said, "It seems that our enemies – the imperialists and their running dogs – have realized what a tremendous threat the Sino-Soviet friendship poses to them. Therefore, they are frantically attempting to hinder the further development of this friendship, even if only to a certain extent. However, there is no force in the world that can destroy or weaken the unbreakable, fraternal friendship and cooperation between our two countries. This friendship, built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism, will last forever. It is a force of terror to our enemies and a source of happiness and joy to the people of China and the Soviet Union."

The speeches by Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi and Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Antonov were constantly interrupted by stormy and enthusiastic applause. This applause showed the great and unparalleled strength of the unity of the Chinese and Soviet people.

After the speeches, one hundred and seventy Young Pioneers from China and the Soviet Union, holding bouquets of flowers, entered the venue and went to the rostrum in separate lines. The Young Pioneers from the two countries gave cordial speeches, congratulating the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and wishing the Sino-Soviet friendship to last forever. After the congratulatory speeches, the children of the two countries presented flowers to the comrades of China and the Soviet Union.

The grand Sino-Soviet friendship gathering celebrating the ninth anniversary of the People's Republic of China was held in the CPPCC Auditorium. In the center of the rostrum, decorated with red flags and surrounded by blooming potted flowers, was placed a bust of Lenin. Huge portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Khrushchev were hung on either side of Lenin's statue. All of this solemn arrangement demonstrated the victory of the glorious Marxism-Leninism.

Attending this friendship gathering were Soviet expert leaders F. V. Mitin and Tovmagov, as well as all the Soviet experts in Beijing, officials from the Soviet Embassy, and responsible persons from various departments of our national organs.

The grand friendship gathering began. Comrades from China and the Soviet Union first enjoyed the wonderful song, dance, and music programs performed by actors from various ethnic groups in our country in the main hall of the auditorium. Then, they participated in various games, watched movies, and danced social dances in various parts of the auditorium. Tonight, the CPPCC Auditorium was immersed in endless joy and sincere friendship.

    陈毅副总理在中苏友谊联欢会上说
    美国强盗颈上绞索越拉越紧
    安东诺夫热烈祝贺我国国庆，他说：中苏友谊对敌人是一种恐惧的力量，而对中苏两国人民则是一种幸福和欢乐。
    新华社27日讯  陈毅副总理兼外交部长今天说：“在这东风压倒西风的时代，美帝国主义的侵略活动只能使套在他自己脖子上的绞索越拉越紧，如果他们敢于把战争强加在中国人民头上，那么中国人民在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的支持和援助下，一定要使美帝国主义遭受彻底的失败。”
    今晚，在北京的苏联朋友和中国国家机关各部门负责人为庆祝我国国庆九周年举行了盛大的友谊联欢会。陈毅副总理兼外交部长在联欢会上的讲话中说：“美帝国主义用武装部队侵占了黎巴嫩之后，最近又在台湾海峡对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，妄图阻挠我国解放自己的沿海岛屿和台湾。六亿中国人民已经对美国侵略者作出了词严义正的回答。苏联政府和苏联人民对中国人民的正义斗争，表示了无比深切的同情和无条件的援助和支持，这种同仇敌忾的精神，给予中国人民极大的兴奋和鼓舞，中国人民对于这种深厚的兄弟情谊，表示由衷的感激。”
    陈毅副总理说：“目前中国人民正在集中全力办好自己的社会主义建设，同时也为向共产主义过渡准备条件，全国各地正掀起建设人民公社的潮流，我相信坚强的中国人民一定能达到建设自己的幸福生活的目的，同时为防止侵略者的挑衅和进攻，我们中国人民又定下全民皆兵个个练武的誓约，这就是说爱好和平的中国人民，从事和平建设的中国人民，决不侵略任何国家也决不让任何国家侵略自己。保卫和平和建设自己，这是中国人民在现在局势下的神圣的政治任务，它必须完成也一定能够完成。我们不怕侵略者的挑衅，我们愿意与全世界爱好和平的人民一道前进。胜利属于爱好和平的人民，这是肯定了的。侵略者终要失败，也是肯定了的！”
    陈毅副总理说：“今年是我国第二个五年计划的第一年，同时又是在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，工农业全面大跃进的一年。”“工农业生产的大跃进，又掀起了技术革命和文化革命的高潮，促进了各项建设事业的全面跃进。”他强调指出：“中国人民在建设事业上的成就，是同苏联政府和苏联人民以及它们派来的优秀的专家们所给予我们的真诚援助分不开的。”“苏联专家们在伟大的苏联共产党的培育下，本着国际主义的精神，热心地传授了苏联的先进经验，用自己丰富的科学技术知识帮助我们解决了建设中的许多重大问题，并且为我国培养了大量的专业人材，这些因素对于我国的社会主义建设事业大跃进都起了积极的作用。我代表中国政府和中国人民再一次向您们表示衷心的感谢。”陈毅副总理又说：“我们一定要继续虚心地向苏联先进经验学习，向在我国工作的优秀的苏联专家们学习。”
    接着，苏联驻中国大使馆临时代办安东诺夫作了充满友谊激情的讲话。他一开始就说：“今天我们像一个团结友爱的大家庭的成员一样，团聚在一起庆祝具有极其重大意义的日子——中华人民共和国成立九周年纪念日。请允许我利用这个机会向中苏同志热烈地祝贺，祝贺即将到来的我们共同的伟大节日——中华人民共和国成立九周年。”
  安东诺夫讲话中强烈表示全体苏联人民完全支持中国人民的正义斗争。他说：“不久以前苏联政府的领袖赫鲁晓夫同志声明说，帝国主义者对我国伟大的朋友、盟邦和邻国中华人民共和国的侵犯也就是对苏联的侵犯，忠于自己义务的我国，将尽一切可能同人民中国一道来维护两国的安全、维护远东和平的利益和世界和平的利益。这个声明表达了全体苏联人民的意志。正因为这个原因，这个声明在我国各地获得了热烈的响应，获得了工人、农民、知识分子和苏军战士一致的拥护。”
    安东诺夫说：“中国人民完全有权收回自己的领土，并且可以确信，苏联人民支持中国的话是坚定不移和确实可靠的，我们毫不怀疑，有关台湾地区的一切任务中国人民必定会胜利地解决的。”
    安东诺夫在讲话中热烈祝贺中国人民在社会主义建设中的伟大胜利。他说：“亲爱的同志们！中国劳动人民是在巨大的政治和劳动的高潮下来迎接中华人民共和国成立九周年的，他们在全世界面前显示出摆脱了帝国主义压迫的勤劳天才的人民的有着多大的才能。可以毫不过分地说，中国普通人民日常辛勤劳动的每一天都表现了群众性的英勇气概。当苏联人民和其他一切社会主义国家的劳动人民听到中国农业高额丰产和发展钢铁工业、机器制造业、电力工业和其他工业部门的宏伟计划时，他们为自己的中国兄弟感到十分自豪，并且热情地希望能够给予你们——我们亲爱的朋友——更多、更多的帮助。”
    安东诺夫还说：随着中华人民共和国的成立，我们两国之间的友谊和合作已进入新的、更高的发展阶段。我们两国所奉行的以各国人民的友好和和平为基础的积极的外交政策，粉碎了帝国主义企图发动新的世界大战的阴谋。我们完全同意中国朋友们对目前国际形势所作的生动的比喻：“东风压倒了西风”。
    安东诺夫说：“看来我们的敌人——帝国主义分子及其走狗，已经认识到，中苏友谊对他们来说是一支多么巨大的威胁力量，因此他们便猖狂地企图那怕是在某种程度上阻碍这种友谊的进一步发展。但是，世界上没有任何力量能够摧毁或削弱我们两国之间牢不可破的、兄弟般的友谊和合作。这种建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的友谊将永远存在，它对我们的敌人是一种恐惧的力量，而对中苏两国人民则是一种幸福和欢乐。”
    陈毅副总理兼外交部长和安东诺夫临时代办的讲话，不断为暴风雨般的热烈掌声所打断。这掌声显示出中苏两国人民团结一致的巨大无比的力量。
    讲话后，一百七十名中苏两国的少年先锋队员，捧着花束，分别列队进入会场和走上主席台，两国少年先锋队员亲切致词，祝贺中华人民共和国国庆九周年，祝贺中苏友谊万年长青。在致祝词以后，两国的儿童把鲜花分别献给中苏两国的同志。
    盛大的庆祝中华人民共和国九周年的中苏友谊联欢会在政协礼堂举行。插着红旗和环绕着怒放的盆花的主席台中央，端端正正地放着列宁的半身塑像，毛泽东主席和赫鲁晓夫主席的巨幅画像高悬在列宁塑像的两旁。这一切隆重的布置显示了光辉的马克思列宁主义的胜利。
    参加这个友谊联欢会的，有苏联专家负责人符明和托夫马果夫及在京的全体苏联专家，苏联大使馆官员，我国国家机关各部门的负责人。
    盛大的友谊联欢会开始了。中苏两国的同志首先在礼堂正厅欣赏了我国各民族演员表演的精彩的歌舞音乐节目，然后，在礼堂各处参加各种游艺、观看电影和跳交谊舞。今晚，政协礼堂沉醉在无尽的欢乐和诚挚的友谊中。
