Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, September 21st: The people in the Fujian front-line area warmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, expressing their intention to actively support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan with practical actions, and to refute Dulles's shameless nonsense.

The vast number of sailors in the coastal areas believe that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement fully represents their views. Huang Chaoji, a 59-year-old veteran sailor and technical innovation expert, excitedly stated that they are ready to wait for the call of the motherland and prepare to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinmen and Mazu, just as they supported the liberation of Xiamen in 1949. Sailor Zhang Yaohui said that it is typical robber logic for Dulles to say that it is not aggression for the United States to send planes and warships to the Chinese coast, ten thousand kilometers away from the United States, but it is "aggression" for the Chinese people to liberate their own territory. Now Dulles is talking about a "ceasefire." No war has occurred between China and the United States, so what "fire" is there to cease? Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops are entrenched in Jinmen and Mazu, and have harmed countless sailors. We will never stop fighting until these coastal islands are liberated.

The teachers and students of Xiamen University, who have suffered deeply from the Kuomintang bandit army’s artillery fire, have recently formed a militia guard company composed of students to defend their school. Xu Changyuan, the company commander of this militia guard company, and Lin Qiquan, the instructor, pointed out that the United States is doing its utmost to support and instruct Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops to bombard Xiamen University with American-made shells, disrupting the students' studies and lives. If this is not aggression, then what is? They said: If Jinmen and Mazu are not liberated for one day, the studies and lives of Xiamen students will be threatened for one day. We will never be intimidated by American-made shells. On the contrary, we will more tenaciously persist in our studies, strengthen military training, and be ready at all times to respond to the call of the motherland and fight to defend the motherland and liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan.

Today, the militias of the frontline villages such as Wutong and Hecuo on Xiamen Island, facing Jinmen, held a meeting amidst the rumble of artillery fire, resolutely supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, and unanimously expressed that they would never give up until Jinmen and Mazu are liberated and Taiwan is liberated. The vast number of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and Taiwanese compatriots in the front-line areas believe that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement fully represents their will. Yan Xiyue, chairman of the Xiamen Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that the more than 40,000 returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Xiamen guarantee that they will fully support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan. We will support whatever the People's Liberation Army needs. We will not stop fighting until Jinmen and Mazu are liberated. Liao Kunwei, chairman of the Xiamen Taiwan Compatriot Association, said that the eight million compatriots in Taiwan must no longer tolerate the US imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous bandits riding on the heads of the compatriots in Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan. We must use practical actions to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan, and to repel the war provocations of US imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 22nd: The local organizations of all democratic parties in Fujian Province jointly issued a statement yesterday, resolutely supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, believing that this statement expresses the will and determination of the 600 million people of our country.

The statement said that recovering Jinmen and Mazu, and liberating Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, is our country's internal affair, just as we liberated Hainan Island, Yijiangshan Island, and Dachen Island in the past. No interference from the US government is allowed. Recently, the US government, disregarding Premier Zhou's statement and our government's repeated warnings, has insisted on carrying out military provocations and war threats against our people; and has engaged in atomic blackmail, attempting to occupy our territory for a long time. We express our utmost indignation at this blatant act of robbery.

The joint statement called on all members of the democratic parties in Fujian Province to recognize the hideous face of US imperialism, participate in the struggle to recover Jinmen and Mazu and liberate Taiwan with practical actions, exert all their energy, and launch a high tide of cultural revolution and technological revolution, strengthen scientific research work, guarantee the over-fulfillment of steel and grain production tasks, actively participate in people's communes, actively participate in militia organizations, quickly make all preparations, and immediately rise up to kill the enemy at the call of the motherland. We will not stop fighting until the American troops roll back. Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu must return to the embrace of the motherland. We will never give up until we achieve our goal.

The following organizations signed the joint statement: The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, the Preparatory Committee of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, and the Fujian Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League.

    福建人民誓以行动回击杜勒斯谰言
    决心完成解放沿海岛屿任务
    各民主党派福建省地方组织号召成员随时准备奋起杀敌
    新华社福建前线21日电　福建前线地区人民群众热烈拥护陈毅外交部长的声明，表示要用实际行动积极支援人民解放军解放金门、马祖和台湾，回击杜勒斯的无耻谰言。
    沿海地区广大海员认为陈毅外交部长的声明完全代表了他们的意见。五十九岁的老海员技术革新能手黄朝基激动地表示，他们随时等待着祖国召唤，准备像1949年支援解放军解放厦门一样，支援解放军去解放金门、马祖。海员张瑶辉说，美国把飞机军舰开到离美国一万公里以外的中国沿海来不算侵略，中国人民解放自己的领土倒是“侵略”，这是杜勒斯典型的强盗逻辑。现在杜勒斯又说什么“停火”，中美之间没有发生战争，停什么“火”？蒋贼军盘踞在金门马祖不知残害了多少海员，不解放这些沿海岛屿，我们决不停止斗争。
    深受蒋贼军炮火残害的厦门大学师生，最近由学生组成了保卫自己学校的民兵警卫连。这个民兵警卫连连长许长远、指导员林其泉指出，美国竭力支持和指使蒋贼军用美制炮弹轰击厦门大学，破坏学生的学习和生活，这不是侵略是甚么？他们说：金门、马祖一天不解放，厦大学生们的学习和生活就一天受到威胁。我们决不会被美制炮弹吓倒，相反地要更加顽强地坚持学习，加强军事训练，时刻准备着响应祖国的号召，为保卫祖国和解放金门马祖、台湾而战。
    面对金门的厦门岛五通、何厝等前沿各乡民兵今天在炮声隆隆中举行集会，坚决拥护陈毅外交部长的声明，一致表示不解放金门马祖，不解放台湾决不罢休。前线地区广大归国华侨、华侨眷属和台湾同胞认为陈毅外交部长的声明完全代表了他们的意志。厦门市归国华侨联合会主席颜西岳说，厦门的四万多归侨、侨属保证要全力支援解放军解放金门马祖和台湾，解放军要什么我们支援什么，金门马祖一天不解放一天不停止斗争。厦门市台湾同乡会理事长廖昆维说，台湾八百万同胞绝不能再容忍美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国贼骑在金门、马祖、台湾同胞的头上，我们要用实际行动支援解放军解放金门马祖和台湾，回击美帝国主义的战争挑衅。
    新华社福州22日电　各民主党派福建省地方组织昨天联合发表声明，坚决拥护陈毅外长的声明，认为这个声明表达了我国六亿人民的意志和决心。
    声明说，收复金门、马祖，解放台湾和澎湖列岛，是我国内政，正如我们过去解放海南岛、一江山岛和大陈岛一样，绝不允许美国政府干涉。最近美国政府不顾我国周总理的声明和我国政府的一再警告，坚持对我国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁；并进行原子讹诈，企图长期占领我国的领土，对这种明目张胆的强盗行为，我们表示无比愤怒。
    联合声明号召福建省全体民主党派成员认清美帝国主义的狰狞面目，以实际行动参加收复金门、马祖和解放台湾的斗争，鼓足干劲，掀起文化革命与技术革命的高潮，加强科学研究工作，保证超额完成钢铁与粮食的生产任务，积极参加人民公社，积极参加民兵组织，迅速做好一切准备，祖国一声召唤，立即奋起杀敌。美国军队一天不滚回去，我们的斗争就一天也不停止。台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖一定要回到祖国的怀抱。不达目的，誓不罢休。
    在联合声明上署名的有中国国民党革命委员会福建省委员会、中国民主同盟福建省委员会、中国农工民主党福建省委员会、中国民主建国会福建省委员会、中国致公党福建省筹备委员会、中国台湾民主自治同盟福建省支部。
