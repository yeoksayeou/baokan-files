Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Caracas: The whole nation of Venezuela is united and on the 7th, again smashed a reactionary armed coup. Some of the ringleaders who plotted the coup have been arrested, and some have fled to foreign embassies.

This reactionary armed coup was launched by students of the police academy, instigated by the remnants of the former dictator Jiménez who secretly returned to the country. They took advantage of the opportunity when the Chairman of the five-member military junta currently in power in Venezuela, Rear Admiral Larrázabal, left the capital to inspect work, launching this coup and briefly occupying the Ministry of Defense and various radio stations in the capital. However, in less than a few minutes, the army, navy, and air force loyal to the government, as well as people from all walks of life in the capital, recaptured the places occupied by the rebels. Thus, a reactionary armed coup was crushed at the outset.

After the rebellion occurred, Larrázabal immediately rushed back to the capital, braving the gunfire of the rebels to enter the location of the military junta, issued an ultimatum to the rebels, and called on the people of the whole country to unite and smash the rebellion conspiracy and defend the democratic fruits they had achieved. Various political parties and trade unions in Venezuela also issued similar calls, and trade unions also called for a general strike to counter the armed coup.

Responding to the government's call, thousands of citizens in the capital gathered around the location of the military junta to protect the military junta. The rebels brutally opened fire on the masses, causing heavy casualties. Despite this, the masses continued to pour into the military junta to resist the rebels' offensive.

In other areas of the capital, citizens and students also built obstacles and distributed weapons, preparing to counterattack the rebels.

After suppressing the rebellion, the military junta issued a public statement saying that one of the ringleaders of the rebellion had been arrested and three had fled to foreign embassies. National order has returned to normal, and the garrison troops are loyal to the government and the cause of democracy. The communiqué also stated that Venezuela's election preparations will proceed as originally planned, and the government will fulfill its promise to return to the people the right to elect legislative representatives to re-establish Venezuela's democratic system.

Venezuela's elections are scheduled to be held in November this year. The current five-member military junta took power after overthrowing the former dictator Jiménez earlier this year. After taking power, the military junta implemented some democratic measures in the country. In July this year, with the support of the people of the whole country, it crushed a reactionary armed coup attempted by the then Minister of Defense Castro-León.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Caracas: 700,000 workers in Venezuela held a general strike on the 8th, demanding that the military junta severely punish the perpetrators of the reactionary armed coup that was crushed on the 7th, and expel the students of the police academy who participated in the coup, dismiss the military officers who participated in the coup and immediately try them, and purge the bad elements in the agencies.

The general strike was launched under the call of the Venezuelan Confederation of Labor. In its instructions, the Confederation of Labor said that the strike would continue until those responsible for this reactionary coup were punished.

Except for workers in publishing and printing, radio and television broadcasting, medical and pharmaceutical services, and water and electricity, workers in other industries participated in the strike. In the capital Caracas, all shops, agencies and factories were closed.

    全国上下一致保卫了民主成果
　　委内瑞拉再次粉碎武装政变
    工人举行罢工要求严惩阴谋分子
    新华社8日讯　加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉全国上下团结一致，在7日又粉碎了一次反动武装政变，策动政变的头子有的已经被逮捕，有的逃到外国使馆。
    这次反动武装政变是由秘密潜回国内的前独裁者希门尼斯的残余党羽策动警官学校的学生进行的。他们趁目前在委内瑞拉执政的五人军事委员会的主席拉腊萨巴耳海军少将离开首都出去视察工作的机会，发动了这次政变，并且一度占领了国防部和首都的各广播电台。但是，不到几分钟以后，忠于政府的陆、海、空三军和首都各界人民就夺回了被叛乱分子占领的地方。这样，一次反动武装政变在一开头就被粉碎了。
    叛乱发生后拉腊萨巴耳立即赶回首都，冒着叛乱分子的射击进入军事委员会所在地，向叛乱分子发出最后通牒，并且号召全国人民团结一致粉碎叛乱阴谋，保卫他们已经取得的民主果实。委内瑞拉各党派和工会也都发出同样的号召，各工会还号召举行总罢工来回击武装政变。
    首都市民响应政府号召，有数千人集合在军事委员会所在地周围保卫军事委员会，叛乱分子竟残暴开枪射击群众，造成重大伤亡。尽管如此，群众还是不断涌向军事委员会抵御叛乱分子的进攻。
    在首都其他地区，市民和学生也纷纷修筑障碍和分发武器，准备对叛乱分子进行反击。
    军事委员会在糎平叛乱后发表公报说，发动叛乱的头子有一个被逮捕，三个逃到外国使馆。全国秩序已恢复正常，卫戌军队忠于政府和民主事业。公报还说，委内瑞拉的选举准备工作将按照原计划进行，政府将履行它把人民选举立法代表以重新建立委内瑞拉民主制度的权利交还人民的诺言。
    委内瑞拉的选举定在今年11月举行，目前的五人军事委员会是在今年初推翻前独裁者希门尼斯以后掌握政权的。军事委员会掌握政权后在国内实行了一些民主措施。今年7月间，它曾经在全国人民支持下粉碎了当时的国防部长卡斯特罗—莱昂企图发动的一次反动武装政变。
    据新华社9日讯　加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉全国七十万工人8日举行总罢工，要求军事委员会严惩在7日被粉碎的反动武装政变的肇事凶手，并且开除参与政变的警察学校的学员，罢黜参与政变的军官和立即审讯他们，以及清除机关中的坏分子。
    总罢工是在委内瑞拉全国劳工联合会的号召下举行的。劳工联合会在它发出的指示中说，除非应对这次反动政变负责的人都受到惩处，罢工将一直继续下去。
    全国除了出版印刷、无线电和电视广播、医务和医药以及水电工人外，其他各业工人都参加了罢工。在首都加拉加斯，所有的商店、机关和工厂都关了门。
