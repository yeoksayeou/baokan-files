    In his letter of September 7 to U.S. President Eisenhower, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev clearly declared: "An attack on our great friend, ally, and neighbor, the People's Republic of China, is an attack on the Soviet Union. Loyal to its obligations, our country will do everything possible, together with the People's China, to safeguard the security of both countries, the interests of peace in the Far East, and the interests of world peace." This is powerful support for the Chinese people's struggle against U.S. military provocations, and a serious warning to the U.S. authorities. Anyone with a clear head will not fail to understand the weight of these two sentences.
    Since U.S. imperialism has been carrying out military provocations and war threats against the Chinese people, the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union have expressed deep sympathy and active support for the just struggle of the Chinese people. The Mongolian government issued a statement, and Korean Premier Kim Il-sung, Vietnamese Premier Pham Van Dong, First Deputy Chairman of the Mongolian Council of Ministers Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers Yugov, Chairman of the Romanian Council of Ministers Stoica, First Deputy Premier of the German Democratic Republic Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party Gomulka, Chairman of the Albanian Council of Ministers Shehu, Hungarian Minister of State Marosan, and Czechoslovak Deputy Foreign Minister Hajek, have all made speeches, solemnly condemning the United States for interfering in China's internal affairs and supporting the Chinese people's struggle against aggression. The Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude for this noble internationalist spirit of the Soviet Union and the fraternal countries. The existence of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and their support, encouraged the Chinese people in the past dark years to resolutely fight against the victorious struggle of domestic and foreign reactionaries; after the establishment of our People's Republic, it has also helped the socialist construction of our country. The Chinese people deeply know that our struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and defend world peace is not isolated. Behind us, there is the powerful Soviet Union and the socialist countries. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is a strong fortress of world peace. The closely united and mutually supportive socialist camp is an invincible force for maintaining world peace and curbing the aggressive ambitions of the bellicose imperialist groups.
    As the saying goes, those who have the Tao receive much help. The Chinese people's anti-aggression struggle has also received support from Asia, Africa, and even Latin America on the other side of the Pacific. The Chinese people treat these valuable supports with gratitude.
    We are pleased to know that President Nasser of the United Arab Republic condemned the United States' occupation of Taiwan as direct aggression against China and a real interference threatening world peace. The people of the Arab countries, who have suffered greatly from imperialist and colonial policies, naturally understand that the Chinese people's struggle against the U.S. gunboat policy is a just struggle. The common interests of the struggle against imperialism and colonialism unite us all. The Damascus "Al-Ra'i al-'Amm" pointed out: "The struggle against imperialism makes the Arab people and the Chinese people embark on the same path of struggle. ... Since the struggle for freedom in the world is an indivisible unified action, participating in this struggle is the responsibility of everyone who demands liberation from imperialism and its forces." Iraqi Republic Radio said, "The Arab people are struggling to insist on liberating Jordan and Lebanon from the occupation of imperialist troops, and to defeat all conspiracies against the Republic of Iraq and the Syrian region. They are also vigilant and support their Chinese brothers' struggle against imperialist aggressors in a spirit of solidarity." "Voice of Free Lebanon" radio expressed the righteous indignation of the Lebanese people, who are still under the occupation of U.S. armed forces, against the U.S. aggressors. It said, "Every upright Lebanese and Arab hopes, if possible, to fly to China and fight the U.S. imperialists together with the Chinese people." The African People's Union also sent a telegram announcing that the people of the African continent support the Chinese people's struggle against U.S. aggression.
    The Chinese people have received friendly sympathy from Southeast Asian countries. Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out that Taiwan and the coastal islands should belong to China. The All-India Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee issued a statement strongly condemning the United States for continuing to interfere in China's internal affairs and hindering the Chinese government's legitimate desire to liberate Chinese territory. Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk believes that returning the coastal islands to China is "reasonable and beneficial to peace." The Cambodian "Amitie" newspaper demanded that the United States stop its provocations in the Taiwan region. The newspaper wrote: "We should strive to stop the war... To this end, we should support the side of justice, the side of peace." "And the side of justice is the People's China, which has full rights over its own territory." Indonesian parliamentarian Mansjur said that China's recovery of Taiwan and the coastal islands is China's internal affair, and foreign arbitrary interference is absolutely not allowed." The Indonesian Peace Committee issued a statement condemning the United States' provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait, demanding that the United States immediately withdraw its troops from Taiwan and other Chinese coastal islands, and respect China's regulations on the twelve-nautical-mile territorial sea. A Burmese "Vanguard" editorial said: "Whether geographically, historically, or legally, Taiwan is Chinese territory. China has the right to take any means and liberate Taiwan at any time it wishes. The United States' insistence that China not use force in Taiwan is interfering in China's internal affairs, which is tantamount to closing the door to Sino-U.S. talks."
    In Japan, more than 300 representatives of more than 20 people's organizations such as the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, peace, friendship, trade unions, women, youth, and trade held a meeting in Tokyo on the 9th, strongly condemning the United States for creating tension in the Far East, and demanding that the United States immediately withdraw all armed forces, including the Seventh Fleet, from the Taiwan region.
    The representatives and observers from Brazil, Guatemala, Uruguay, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Mexico and other countries attending the International Student Union Congress held in Beijing brought the support of the Latin American people to the Chinese people. In their speeches at the conference, they unanimously condemned the United States for interfering in China's internal affairs, and expressed their full support for the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands.
    All of this undoubtedly strengthens and encourages the Chinese people's struggle against the U.S. aggressors. The justice of the Chinese people's struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and defend world peace determines that it wins the universal sympathy and support of all peace-loving and freedom-loving people.
    In contrast, the U.S. imperialist provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait, as the British "Manchester Guardian" pointed out, there is probably no other government in the world, except for Syngman Rhee, that would fight alongside the United States for the Jinmen Islands. People know that this Syngman Rhee is a mad dog in the U.S. chain. Nor does anyone with a little memory doubt that if U.S. imperialism dares to let this mad dog out, it will suffer a more severe and devastating blow than it suffered in the Korean War, which ended only five years ago. U.S. imperialism cannot but know how lonely it is besides Syngman Rhee. Canadian Foreign Minister Smith, Thai Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn, Philippine President Garcia, and Australian Prime Minister Menzies have all stated that they do not want their governments to be involved in the armed conflict that may break out in the Taiwan Strait region. Even in the United States, the adventurous policy of the Washington authorities is very unpopular. A reader of the "New York Post" wrote: "How many American lives are we going to sacrifice to support a traitorous regime driven out of mainland China?" A Detroit "Free Press" editorial wrote: "We seriously doubt whether one in a million Americans is willing to fight for Taiwan." Recently, the U.S. bourgeoisie has been arguing about the tension created by the Eisenhower administration in the Taiwan Strait region. It is worth mentioning that some of those who once supported the Chiang Kai-shek group in launching an anti-people civil war seem to have learned a lesson after their painful failure. For example, Hurley, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the Kuomintang government in 1946, attacked Eisenhower's military adventure as suicide. Another is former Secretary of State Acheson, who presided over the writing of the "White Paper" aimed at summarizing the lessons of the failure of the U.S. policy toward China. He criticized Dulles's "brink of war" policy, saying that the United States has lost the ability to control the situation. These are the truth. It seems that only those who are blinded by profit like Nixon are keen on military adventures, but even he is afraid that the United States will really show that it is a paper tiger.
    Chairman Mao Zedong said at the recent Supreme State Conference, "U.S. imperialism is creating tension everywhere in the world in order to achieve its goal of aggression and enslavement of the people of all countries. U.S. imperialism thinks that tension is always beneficial to itself, but the fact is that these tensions created by the United States have gone in the opposite direction of the Americans' wishes, and it has played a role in mobilizing the people of the world to rise up against the U.S. aggressors." Now people have seen from this war provocation incident by the U.S. aggressors against China that U.S. imperialism is reaping what it sows and has been condemned and opposed from all over the world.
    The situation in the Taiwan Strait has become very dangerous due to U.S. military provocations. Is U.S. imperialism going to tighten this new noose of "protecting Jinmen and Mazu" around its neck? Or will it withdraw the bloody hands of the aggressors under the serious warnings of China and the Soviet Union? At this critical moment, Dulles' empty words and the White House spokesman's sophistry are useless. The Chinese people and the people of the world are vigilantly watching the United States' actions in the Taiwan Strait region.

### 我们的朋友遍天下

专栏：社论

    我们的朋友遍天下
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在9月7日给美国艾森豪威尔总统的信中明确地宣告：“对我国伟大的朋友、盟邦和邻国中华人民共和国的侵犯也就是对苏联的侵犯。忠于自己义务的我国，将尽一切可能同人民中国一道来维护两国的安全、维护远东和平的利益和世界和平的利益。”这是对我国人民反对美国军事挑衅的斗争的强有力的支持，也是对美国当局的严重警告。任何一个头脑清醒的人，都不难理解这两句话的份量。
    自从美帝国主义对我国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁以来，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国对中国人民的正义斗争表示了深切的同情和积极的支持。蒙古政府发表声明，朝鲜金日成首相、越南范文同总理、蒙古部长会议第一副主席曾德、保加利亚于哥夫主席、罗马尼亚部长会议主席斯托伊卡、德意志民主共和国第一副总理乌布利希、波兰统一工人党第一书记哥穆尔卡、阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡、匈牙利的国务部长马罗山、捷克斯洛伐克外交部副部长哈耶克，都先后发表讲话，严正地谴责了美国干涉我国内政，支持中国人民反侵略的斗争。中国人民对于苏联和各兄弟之邦的这种崇高的国际主义精神，表示由衷的感激。苏联和社会主义阵营其他各国的存在和它们的声援，在过去的黑暗的岁月里，鼓舞了我国人民坚决反对国内外反动派的胜利斗争；在我们的人民共和国成立以后，又帮助了我国人民的社会主义建设。我国人民深深知道，我们的为维护国家主权和保卫世界和平的斗争不是孤立的，在我们的背后，有着强大的苏联和社会主义各国。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，是世界和平的强大堡垒。紧密团结和互相支援的社会主义阵营，是维护世界和平和抑制好战的帝国主义集团的侵略野心的不可战胜的力量。
    古语说，得道者多助。我国人民的反侵略斗争，还得到来自亚洲、非洲以至太平洋彼岸拉丁美洲的声援。我国人民怀着感激的心情对待这些可贵的声援。
    我们高兴地知道，阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔谴责美国占领台湾是对中国的直接侵略，是威胁世界和平的真正干涉。备受帝国主义的侵略政策和殖民政策之害的阿拉伯各国的人民，十分自然地了解中国人民反对美国炮舰政策的斗争是正义的斗争。反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争的共同利益，把我们大家联系在一起。大马士革“舆论报”指出：“反对帝国主义的斗争使得阿拉伯人民同中国人民走上同一的斗争道路。……由于全世界争取自由的斗争是不能分割的统一行动，参加这一斗争是每一个要求从帝国主义及其势力下解放出来的人的责任。”伊拉克共和国电台说，“阿拉伯人民正在为坚持把约旦和黎巴嫩从帝国主义军队占领下解放出来，并且为击败反对伊拉克共和国和叙利亚地区的一切阴谋而进行斗争。他们也提高警惕，本着团结的精神来支持他们的中国兄弟为反对帝国主义侵略者而进行的斗争。”“自由黎巴嫩之声”电台，道出了目前仍然处在美国武装部队侵占下的黎巴嫩人民对美国侵略者的义愤。它说，“每一个正直的黎巴嫩人和阿拉伯人都希望，如果可能的话，飞到中国去同中国人民一起打击美帝国主义者。”非洲人联盟也拍来了电报，宣布非洲大陆人民支持我国人民反对美国侵略的斗争。
    中国人民从东南亚各国得到了友好的同情，印度总理尼赫鲁指出，台湾和沿海岛屿应当属于中国。印度亚非团结委员会发表声明，强烈谴责美国继续干涉中国内政和阻挠中国政府解放中国领土的合法愿望。柬埔寨首相西哈努克认为把沿海岛屿归还中国是“合理的，对和平有利的”。柬埔寨“友好报”要求制止美国在台湾地区的挑衅。报纸写道：“我们应该力求制止战争……为此，应该支持正义的一方、和平的一方。”“而正义的一方是人民中国，它在自己的领土上拥有充分的权利。”印度尼西亚的国会议员曼休尔说，中国收复台湾和沿海岛屿是中国的内政，外国专断的干涉是绝对不能容许的”，印度尼西亚和平委员会发表声明，谴责美国在台湾海峡的挑衅行动，要求美国军队立即撤出台湾和其他中国沿海岛屿，并且尊重中国关于十二海里领海范围的规定。缅甸“先锋报”社论说：“无论从地理上、历史上和法律上来说，台湾是中国的领土。中国有权利采取任何方法并且在愿意的任何时候解放台湾。美国坚持要中国不在台湾使用武力，是干涉中国的内政，这就等于关闭中美会谈的大门。”
    在日本，恢复日中邦交国民会议等二十多个和平、友好、工会、妇女、青年、贸易等人民团体的代表三百多人9日在东京举行会议强烈谴责美国在远东制造紧张局势，并且要求美国立即从台湾地区撤出包括第七舰队在内的一切武装部队。
    出席在北京举行的国际学联代表大会的巴西、危地马拉、乌拉圭、厄瓜多尔、玻利维亚、秘鲁、墨西哥等国的代表和观察员，带来了拉丁美洲人民对我国人民的声援。他们在大会上的发言中一致谴责美国干涉中国内政，表示完全支持中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的正义斗争。
    所有这些，毫无疑问更加坚定和鼓舞我国人民反对美国侵略者的斗争。我国人民维护国家主权和保卫世界和平的斗争的正义性，决定了它赢得所有爱好和平和自由的人民的普遍的同情和支持。
    与此相反，美帝国主义在台湾海峡的挑衅行动，正像英国“曼彻斯特卫报”所指出的，在世界上，除了李承晚以外，大概没有其他政府会为了金门各岛而同美国并肩作战。人们知道这个李承晚是美国锁链中的疯狗。也没有任何稍有记忆的人会怀疑，如果美帝国主义敢于把这只疯狗放出来，它将遭到比在结束才不过五年的朝鲜战争中所受到的更加沉重的毁灭性的打击。美帝国主义不会不知道，除了李承晚之外，它是多么孤单。加拿大外长史密斯、泰国总理乃他侬·吉滴卡宗、菲律宾总统加西亚、澳大利亚总理孟席斯都表示不希望他们的政府被卷入台湾海峡地区可能爆发的武装冲突中去。即使在美国国内，华盛顿当局的冒险政策也十分不得人心。“纽约邮报”的一个读者写道：“为了支持从中国大陆赶出来的卖国政权，我们打算牺牲多少美国人的性命呢？”底特律“自由日报”的社论写道：“我们十分怀疑，一百万美国人中是否有一个人愿意去为台湾作战。”最近美国资产阶级内部正为艾森豪威尔政府在台湾海峡地区制造的紧张局势吵吵嚷嚷。值得一提的是，那些曾经支持过蒋介石集团发动反人民内战的人们中间，有些人似乎在惨痛的失败之余得到了教训。例如，1946年间曾出任美国驻国民党政府的大使的赫尔利，他就攻击艾森豪威尔的军事冒险等于自杀。还有一位是曾经主持编写旨在总结美国对华政策失败教训的“白皮书”的前国务卿艾奇逊。他抨击杜勒斯的“战争边缘”政策，说美国已失去了控制局势的能力。这些都是老实话。看来只有像尼克松那样利令智昏的人才热中于军事冒险，不过连他也害怕美国真的显出是纸老虎了。
    毛泽东主席在不久前举行的最高国务会议上说，“美帝国主义在全世界到处制造紧张局势，以期达到它侵略和奴役各国人民的目的。美帝国主义自以为紧张局势总是对它自己有利，但是事实是，美国制造的这些紧张局势走向了美国人愿望的反面，它起了动员全世界人民起来反对美国侵略者的作用。”现在人们从这一次美国侵略者对中国的战争挑衅事件中，又看到了美帝国主义是在自食其果，遭到了来自全世界各个方面的谴责和反对。
    台湾海峡的局势，由于美国的军事挑衅而出现了十分严重的危险局面。美帝国主义究竟是要把“保护金门马祖”这条新的绞索紧紧套在自己脖子上呢？还是在中国和苏联的严重警告之下，缩回侵略者的血手呢？在这个严重的时刻，杜勒斯的空话，白宫发言人的颠倒是非的说法，都是没有用的。中国人民和全世界人民警惕地注视着美国在台湾海峡地区的行动。
