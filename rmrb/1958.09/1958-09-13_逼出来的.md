    Forced Out
    Chen Rang
    The news that the Shenyang Fan Factory has produced a simplified blower suitable for small blast furnaces and small converters is very exciting. At present, thousands upon thousands of small blast furnaces and small converters have been built across the country, and blowers are urgently needed. However, the existing Yate's and Roots blowers are not easy to manufacture, and the production cycle is very long, which cannot meet the current urgent needs. Now, the Shenyang Fan Factory has successfully developed this simplified blower, which can be mass-produced by small and medium-sized machinery factories in various places and quickly supplied to the iron and steel industry. This is where its great significance lies.
    How did the Shenyang Fan Factory make this simplified blower? In a word: forced out. When this factory received the task of manufacturing 2,000 Roots blowers in June, it made a calculation: according to the factory's production capacity, it would take eight years to complete this task. This path is not feasible. Is there a better way? Truly, "nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it." Under the leadership of the Party committee, the workers boldly imagined and proposed connecting ordinary ventilation fans in series to make blowers for small blast furnaces. After solving some technical problems, this idea was indeed realized. The materials and man-hours used for the simplified blower are about three-quarters less than those for the Roots blower. In this way, completing the task of 2,000 blowers in half a year is very promising.
    During the Great Leap Forward, the workers said well: "We are not afraid of not being able to do it, but of not being able to think of it." Isn't the Shenyang Fan Factory like this? In the struggle to transform the objective world, the people also transformed their subjective world. They see the difficulties in objective conditions, but they believe more in the subjective initiative of people. Objective possibilities are infinite, and people's subjective initiative is also infinite. The problem lies in daring to think and daring to act.
    At the end of this short article, let us quote again a short poem that our newspaper published on page eight a few days ago:
    “Difficulties are like springs, see how strong you are;
    If you are strong, it is weak; if you are weak, it is strong.”

    逼出来的
    陈让
    沈阳扇风机厂制成了一种适合小高炉小转炉用的简易鼓风机，这个消息令人十分兴奋。目前，各地已经建成了几千、几万个小高炉、小转炉，迫切需要鼓风机。但是原有的叶氏和罗茨式鼓风机都不易制造，生产周期很长，满足不了当前的迫切需要。现在沈阳扇风机厂研究成功了这种简易的鼓风机，各地中小机械工厂都可以大量地制造，迅速地供应给钢铁工业。它的重大意义就在这里。
    沈阳扇风机厂怎样做出了这种简易的鼓风机呢？一句话：逼出来的。这个厂在6月份接到要制造两千台罗茨式鼓风机的任务时，曾算了一笔账：按照工厂的生产能力，完成这批任务要用八年。这条路走不通。有没有更好的办法呢？真是“天下无难事，只怕有心人”。在党委领导下，职工们大胆设想，提出把一般通风用的风机串联起来做小高炉的鼓风机。经过在技术上解决一些问题后，这个想法果然实现了。简易的鼓风机所用的材料和工时都比罗茨式的节省四分之三左右。这样，半年完成两千台鼓风机的任务就大有把握了。
    在大跃进中，工人说的好：“不怕做不到，就怕想不到”。沈阳扇风机厂不就是这样吗？人民群众在改造客观世界的斗争中，同时也改造了自己的主观世界。他们看到客观条件中的困难，可是更相信人的主观能动作用。客观的可能性是无限的，人们的主观能动作用也是无限的，问题在于敢想敢干。
    在这篇短文的结尾，让我们再来引用一次本报前几天在八版曾刊登的一首短诗：
    “困难像弹簧，看你强不强；
    你强他就弱，你弱他就强。”
