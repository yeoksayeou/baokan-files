Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 19th: The second bridge spanning the Yangtze River north and south – the Chongqing Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge – officially commenced construction on the 10th. Currently, the Yangtze River water level is rapidly receding, and Chongqing is turning cooler. On the Yangtze River surface and both north and south banks near Baishatuo, over a thousand laborers have deployed for a full-scale construction effort. Small steamers transport construction materials back and forth on the river. The bridge abutment projects at both ends of the bridge and the circular railway line at the north bridgehead have both commenced construction.

The Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge is 820.3 meters long (Editor's note: The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is 1,670 meters long) and will be constructed as a double-track bridge. Due to the design principle of using more piers and less steel beams, the bridge structure will use only slightly more than one-seventh of the steel used in the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. The budgeted investment is only about 20% of the main bridge project of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.

The workers who mastered world-class bridge construction technology during the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge are determined to complete the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge at an even faster pace than the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. The personnel responsible for building this bridge are only one-fifth of those who originally built the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and the construction machinery is only one-quarter, yet they aim to complete the entire project in about one year. According to the construction department's plan, all piers will be rushed to be built above the water surface before the next flood season. While building the piers, they will also adopt a flow-line operation method, starting from the first quarter of next year to begin erecting steel beams.

Chongqing is a major industrial base in the Southwest and a hub for water and land transportation in the Southwest. After the completion of the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge, it will connect the Baoji-Chengdu, Chengdu-Chongqing, and Sichuan-Guizhou railways and the Yangtze River shipping, forming an unimpeded water and land transportation network. This will play a significant role in developing the economy of Sichuan and the Southwest region.

### 重庆长江大桥开工兴建

    重庆长江大桥开工兴建
    据新华社重庆19日电　横跨长江南北的第二座大桥——重庆白沙沱长江大桥，10日正式开工兴建。目前长江水位迅速下落，重庆转凉。白沙沱附近的长江江面和南北两岸，千余名劳动大军已经摆开了全面施工的阵势。江中的小火轮往返运送着施工器材。大桥两端的桥台工程和北岸桥头环行铁路线都已开工。
    重庆长江大桥全长八百二十点三公尺（编者按：武汉长江大桥全长是一千六百七十公尺），将建设成为双轨桥。由于设计上采用了多修桥墩少用钢梁的原则，这座大桥的桥梁部分所用钢材只有武汉长江大桥的七分之一强。预算投资大约只相当于武汉长江大桥正桥工程的20％左右。
    在修建武汉长江大桥过程中掌握了世界上第一流修建桥梁技术的工人们，决心以比建设武汉长江大桥更快的速度建成重庆长江大桥。担负修建这座大桥的人员只有原来修建武汉长江大桥的五分之一，施工机械只有四分之一，而全部工程却要争取在一年左右完工。按照施工部门的安排，所有桥墩都要争取在明年洪水期前抢修出水面。在修建桥墩的同时，他们还将采用流水作业的方法，从明年第一季度起就开始架设钢梁。
    重庆是西南地区的主要工业基地，又是西南水陆交通的枢纽。重庆长江大桥建成以后，将把宝成、成渝、川黔等铁路和长江航运联成一起，组成一个畅通无阻的水陆交通运输网。这对发展四川和西南地区的经济，将起很大作用。
