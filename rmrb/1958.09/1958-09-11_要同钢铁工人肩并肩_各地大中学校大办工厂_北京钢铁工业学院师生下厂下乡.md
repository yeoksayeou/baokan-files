Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Universities and colleges nationwide, combining work-study programs and breaking down superstitions, are establishing steel factories within their campuses or using their technical expertise to support local steel enterprises.

In the work-study programs, many universities and secondary schools across the country are establishing steel ventures, combining their specialties, the characteristics of the school itself, and local needs and conditions. As of the end of August, according to incomplete statistics, eighteen universities and colleges in Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Chongqing, Shenyang, Changsha, Wuhan, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Hefei, and other places have established small and medium-sized smelting equipment, which can refine more than 692,000 tons of steel annually, equivalent to 4.38 times the national steel production in the early days of liberation in 1949. The vast majority of school steel smelting enterprises have been put into production, some are under construction, some will produce steel before National Day, and a small number will be put into production next year. The steel smelting equipment has implemented the spirit of combining popularization and improvement, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. They are simple and crude, using local materials, and finding ways to solve problems themselves. Teachers at Zhangzhou Second Middle School in Fujian Province used small pieces of wood to nail together bellows, and used standard earthen bricks and field soil instead of refractory bricks to build a furnace. After three days and nights of hard work, they successfully refined steel. Ten Young Pioneers at Harbin No. 19 Middle School learned to smelt iron in five days, built a small factory building in one day, and installed iron smelting equipment in one day and a half night. With the support of Young Pioneers from the entire school, they dug out more than 3,000 jin of scrap iron in three days and established a "Young Pioneer Satellite Iron Smelting Plant," which produced the first batch of molten iron in mid-July. The annual output of this small factory is enough for the parts of 1,800 tractors. Liuzhou No. 1 Middle School in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region used local tools and methods, and mixed pig iron and wrought iron without oxygen blowing to successfully refine steel, solving the long-standing problem of steelmaking in Liuzhou.

Schools smelt iron and steel, on the one hand, using products to support national economic construction, and on the other hand, creating experience in iron and steel smelting, improving teaching, and providing technical support for the country's steel construction. Teachers and students of the Department of Metallurgy at Chongqing University have completed the trial smelting of high-speed steel, boron steel, ferroboron, super-strength alloy steel, and super-heat-resistant steel.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology has dispatched 1,529 senior students and young teachers to 19 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions including Hebei, Shandong, and Gansu to vigorously engage in steel industry construction and steel production together with the broad masses of workers and peasants.

On August 28, the Party Committee of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, according to the needs of the great leap forward situation in China's steel industry, proposed that some teachers and students go to the countryside and factories to support local steel industry, which was enthusiastically responded by teachers and students of the whole school. After the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued a call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel throughout the year, it further aroused the determination of teachers and students of the college to go to the countryside and factories to directly fight for steel. The broad masses of teachers and students submitted letters of determination to the Party and Youth League organizations, requesting to go to the most difficult places.

### 要同钢铁工人肩并肩  各地大中学校大办工厂  北京钢铁工业学院师生下厂下乡

    要同钢铁工人肩并肩
    各地大中学校大办工厂
    北京钢铁工业学院师生下厂下乡
    据新华社10日讯　各地大中学校结合勤工俭学打破迷信，在学校里办钢铁工厂，或用技术力量支援地方办钢铁企业。
    在勤工俭学当中，全国许多大学、中等学校结合专业、学校本身特点以及地方需要和条件等，举办钢铁事业。到8月底为止，据不完全的统计，北京、南京、上海、西安、重庆、沈阳、长沙、武汉、天津、太原、合肥等地十八所高等学校举办中、小型的冶炼设备，每年可以炼钢六十九万二千多吨，相当于解放初期1949年全国钢产量的四点三八倍。学校冶炼钢铁的企业绝大部分都已投入生产，一部分正在赶建，有的在国庆节前出钢，小部分在明年投入生产。冶炼钢铁的设备，贯彻了普及与提高并举、土洋并举的精神，都是因陋就简，就地取材，自己动手想尽办法来解决。福建漳州第二中学的教师用小木料钉成鼓风箱，用标准土砖和田土代替耐火砖筑炉，经三昼夜苦战炼出了钢。哈尔滨市十九中学有十个少先队员，五天学会炼铁，一天盖起个小厂房，又用一天零半夜安起炼铁设备，在全校少先队员支援下三天挖出三千多斤废铁，办成了一座“少年卫星炼铁厂”，在7月中旬炼出第一炉铁水。这个小工厂，一年的产品够一千八百台拖拉机的零件的用途。广西僮族自治区柳州市一中利用土工具土办法，用生铁和熟铁混合不吹氧的方法炼成了钢，解决了柳州市过去炼钢中长期没有解决的难题。
    学校炼铁炼钢一方面用产品支援国家经济建设，一方面从炼铁炼钢中创造经验，改进教学，从技术上支援国家的钢铁建设。重庆大学冶金系的教师学生研究完成了锋钢、硼钢、硼铁、超级强度合金钢、超级耐热钢等试炼工作。
    据新华社讯　北京钢铁工业学院抽调一千五百二十九名高年级学生和青年教师，到河北、山东、甘肃等十九个省、市、自治区，与广大工农一起大搞钢铁工业建设和钢铁生产。
    8月28日，北京钢铁工业学院党委根据我国钢铁工业大跃进形势的需要，提出部分师生下乡下厂支援地方钢铁工业的号召，得到全校师生的热烈响应。中共中央政治局扩大会议发出全年生产一千零七十万吨钢的号召以后，更加激起了学院师生要求下乡下厂直接为钢而战的决心。广大师生纷纷向党、团组织递送决心书，要求到最艰苦的地方去。
