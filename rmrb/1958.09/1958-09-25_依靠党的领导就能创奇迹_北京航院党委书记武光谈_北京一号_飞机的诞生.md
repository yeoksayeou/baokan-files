    Relying on the Party's Leadership Can Create Miracles
    Beijing Aviation Institute Party Secretary Wu Guang on the Birth of the "Beijing No. 1" Aircraft

    (Reported by our newspaper) This reporter interviewed Wu Guang, First Secretary of the Party Committee and President of Beijing Aviation Institute, about the creation of the "Beijing No. 1" aircraft. He said that the birth of this aircraft marks the victory of the Party's educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor.

    Wu Guang said: Beijing Aviation Institute has a short history. It had neither specialized aircraft designers, technical workers, nor the necessary equipment and materials for manufacturing aircraft. From teachers to students, none had production experience. If compared to a small child, we didn't even qualify to wear a red scarf. If compared to foreign institutions specializing in aircraft design and manufacturing, the difficulties we faced seemed "insurmountable." However, under the leadership of the Party, relying on the political consciousness and infinite wisdom of the masses, and with the cooperation of relevant units, we worked hard, painstakingly, and cleverly, and designed and manufactured this modern aircraft in just one hundred days. This is indeed a huge collective creation.

    Wu Guang said: The victory was achieved primarily because we conscientiously implemented the Party's educational policy and the general line of socialist construction. This spring, when the Party Central Committee further promoted work-study programs and the combination of education with productive labor, two opposing views emerged in the institute. One was against engaging in productive labor in schools, fearing it would affect teaching. The other, while agreeing to engage in productive labor in schools, only emphasized output value and profits, failing to see the political and educational significance of doing so. The school's Party Committee immediately emphasized that education should be combined with productive labor and transform thinking through labor. Productive labor should be combined with the major as much as possible to improve teaching quality and scientific and technological level through productive labor. After everyone had a clearer understanding of this issue, a right-leaning conservative thought emerged, like a woman with bound feet. They said that the Aviation Institute "would be doing well if it could build an aircraft at all," that "as long as it can fly into the sky, that's good enough," and they worried that "it would be difficult to build a good aircraft in just a few months." Through mass airing of views and debates, these erroneous ideas were criticized. All design and production personnel worked day and night, treating the workshop as a battlefield, and adopted a method combining teaching, scientific research, design, and manufacturing. They continuously created "more, faster, better, and more economical" miracles and finally manufactured the "Beijing No. 1."

    Wu Guang said that Chairman Mao's instruction to "break down superstitions and liberate the mind" gave teachers and students infinite power and wisdom. Without this idea from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, it can be said that there would be no "Beijing No. 1." Everyone broke down superstitions, overcame conservative thinking, and after starting to work, revolutionary methods were devised.

    Wu Guang finally said that through the productive labor of trial-manufacturing the "Beijing No. 1," all teachers and students experienced a concrete practice combining mental and physical labor. The communist ideological consciousness of teachers and students was greatly enhanced, their labor perspective was strengthened, and they established a daring and innovative style. This kind of gain is the most fundamental and priceless treasure. Secondly, through this design and trial-manufacturing work, teachers and students also greatly improved their technical and scientific levels. The direction of scientific research became clearer, and they accumulated a lot of valuable experience and data, laying a good foundation for future scientific research work. These fledgling young people learned new things that they could not have learned in the classroom in the past. As a result, students learned things that they would have only learned two or three years after graduation, before even leaving the school. This actually amounts to greatly shortening the length of study, and they learned more and better things, which also means that they have taken a big step forward on the road of cultivating high-level aviation technicians who are both red and expert, capable in both cultural and military fields.

    依靠党的领导就能创奇迹
    北京航院党委书记武光谈“北京一号”飞机的诞生
    本报讯  本报记者就“北京一号”飞机制成访问了中共北京航空学院党委第一书记兼院长武光，他说，这架飞机的诞生标志着党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合这一方针的胜利。
    武光说：北京航空学院建校历史很短，既没有专门的飞机设计人员，技术工人，也没有制造飞机的必要设备和材料，从教师到学生都没有生产经验。如果拿小孩子来比，那就连带红领巾的资格也没有；如果同外国专门设计和制造飞机的机构相比，我们所面临的困难看来似乎是“难以克服的”。但是我们在党的领导下，依靠群众的政治觉悟和无穷智慧，在有关单位协作下，穷干苦干巧干，只用了一百天就设计和制成了这架现代化的飞机，这确是一个巨大的集体创造。
    武光说：取得这次胜利，首先是因为认真贯彻了党的教育方针和社会主义建设的总路线。今年春天当党中央进一步提倡勤工俭学、教育与生产劳动相结合的时候，在学院里曾经出现过两种意见，一是反对在学校里搞生产劳动，怕影响教学；一是虽然同意在学校搞生产劳动，但只强调产值和利润，看不到这样做在政治和教育方面的意义。学校党委当即强调指出，教育应当结合生产劳动、通过劳动改造思想；生产劳动应尽可能结合专业，通过生产劳动提高教学质量和科学技术水平。当大家对这个问题认识得比较明确以后，又出现了小脚女人般的右倾保守思想，他们说，航空学院“能造出飞机就不错了”，“只要能飞上天就行”，“不必追求先进质量”，他们担心：“用几个月是很难造出好飞机来”。经过群众性的大鸣大放和大辩论，批判了这些错误思想，全体设计和制作人员以黑夜当白天，以车间当战场，采取了教学与科学研究、设计、制造四结合的办法，不断创造出“多快好省”的奇迹，终于制成“北京一号”。
    武光说，毛主席的“破除迷信、解放思想”的指示给师生以无限的力量和智慧，没有党中央和毛主席的这个思想，可以说也就没有“北京一号”。大家打破迷信，克服保守思想，动手干起来以后，革命的办法想了出来。
    武光最后说，通过试制“北京一号”的生产劳动，使所有师生经历了一次脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的具体实践，师生们共产主义的思想觉悟大大提高了，劳动观点加强了，树立了敢想敢做的风格，这种收获是最根本的无价之宝。其次，通过这次设计和试制工作，师生们也大大提高了技术和科学水平，科学研究的方向明确了，并积累了许多宝贵的经验和资料，为今后的科学研究工作打下了良好的基础。这些初出茅庐的青年人学到了过去在教室里所不能学到的新东西。这样做的结果，学生们过去在毕业后两三年才能学到的东西，现在不出学校门就学到了，这实际上就等于大大缩短了学习年限，而且又学到了更多更好的东西，也意味着在培养又红又专、能文能武的高级航空技术人员的道路上迈进了一大步。
