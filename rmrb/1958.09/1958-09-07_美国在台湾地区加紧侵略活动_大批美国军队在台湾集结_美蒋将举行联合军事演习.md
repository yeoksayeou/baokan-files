Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Taipei News: Bickley, commander of the US Seventh Fleet, which is carrying out war provocations in the Taiwan Strait, arrived in Keelung by ship on the 5th and rushed to Taipei to meet with Smoth, commander of the US forces invading Taiwan, and Blackburn, commander of the US Taiwan Patrol Fleet under the Seventh Fleet, to discuss steps to intensify aggressive activities in the Taiwan Strait area. Bickley also summoned Li Yuxi, deputy commander-in-chief of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous army's navy, listened to a report from the Chiang bandit navy, and gave instructions.

This is Bickley's third visit to Taipei in the past half month. Sources said that Bickley has been inspecting the Taiwan Strait and surrounding areas for the past few days, plotting war conspiracies.

Many ships and troops of the American invading forces and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous army have been gathering in southern Taiwan these days. The US and Chiang bandits' Marines are preparing to board American warships to participate in amphibious beach assault exercises to be held near Kaohsiung starting next week. According to Chiang military sources, this joint US-Chiang amphibious landing exercise is the largest of its kind held in the Taiwan area. The amphibious landing exercise will be followed by a joint sea-air exercise.

According to the US Taiwan Defense Command, a squadron of F-86D aircraft from the US Fifth Air Force has been deployed to a US Air Force base in southern Taiwan.

While US military generals are stepping up their planning for armed aggression in Taiwan, the US "Ambassador" to Taiwan, Drumright, also appears to be particularly busy. From September 3rd, he has continuously summoned Huang Shao-gu, the "Foreign Minister" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, for several days to discuss "issues related to the Taiwan situation."

According to a "New York Times" report on the 5th, in addition to sending reinforcement troops to strengthen its naval and air forces in the Far East, the United States has also agreed to accelerate the supply of military equipment such as torpedo boats to the Chiang Kai-shek elements. According to a broadcast from Taipei by CBS on the 5th, the United States will soon transport "Nike" Ajax anti-aircraft missiles and launchers to Taiwan. These weapons will be controlled by the US military, but will eventually be transferred to the Kuomintang army. The US "Matador" missile is already in Taiwan.

    新华社6日讯　台北消息：在台湾海峡进行战争挑衅的美国第七舰队的司令比克利，5日乘舰到基隆，赶往台北同侵台美军司令斯摩特、第七舰队辖下的美国台湾巡逻舰队司令勃莱克本举行会议，商讨在台湾海峡地区加紧侵略活动的步骤。比克利还召见了蒋介石卖国军队的海军副总司令黎玉玺，听取蒋贼海军的报告并且给予指示。
    这是最近半个月来，比克利第三次到台北活动。有消息说，过去几天来，比克利一直在台湾海峡和附近地区巡视，策划战争阴谋。
    美国侵略军和蒋介石卖国军队的许多舰艇和部队，这几天正在向台湾南部集结。美国和蒋贼的海军陆战队，准备登上美国军舰，参加下星期一开始在高雄附近举行两栖海滩攻击演习。据蒋军军方宣称，这次两栖登陆联合演习，是在台湾地区举行的这一类美蒋联合演习中规模最大的一次。两栖登陆演习后接着还举行海空联合演习。
    据侵台美军司令部宣布，美国第五航空队一队F—86D型飞机，已经派驻台湾南部一个美国空军基地。
    在美军将领在台湾加紧策划武装侵略活动的同时，美国驻台湾“大使”德鲁姆赖特也显得特别忙碌。他从9月3日起，一连几天连续召见蒋介石卖国集团的“外交部长”黄少谷，商谈“台湾局势有关问题”。
    另据“纽约时报”5日报道，美国除了派遣增援部队加强它在远东的海、空军以外，还同意加速供给蒋介石分子以鱼雷艇等军事装备。另据美国哥伦比亚广播公司5日从台北广播说，美国不久将把“奈克”阿贾克斯式防空导弹和发射装置运往台湾。这些武器将由美军掌握，但是最后将移交给国民党军队。美国“斗牛士”式导弹已经在台湾。
