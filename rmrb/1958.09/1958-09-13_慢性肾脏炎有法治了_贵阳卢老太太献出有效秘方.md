Chronic Nephritis Can Be Cured
Guiyang Old Lady Lu Offers Effective Secret Recipe

(Our newspaper reports) Old Lady Lu, who was hired as a consultant of Traditional Chinese Medicine at Guiyang Medical College, gave an academic report to the teachers and students of Guiyang Medical College on September 2, detailing her prescription and treatment methods for treating the nephrotic stage of chronic nephritis.

Currently, there is no specific effective treatment for the nephrotic stage of chronic nephritis (commonly known as swelling or edema) in any country in the world. Recently, with the help of Guiyang Medical College, Old Lady Lu, a woman in her seventies from Guiyang City, has contributed a family secret recipe with remarkable efficacy for treating this disease.

The affiliated hospital of Guiyang Medical College used this secret recipe for clinical trials on four patients. The trial results were as expected by the old lady: the patients' edema completely disappeared within five days after taking two doses of the medicine, and there was no recurrence of swelling. The medical college is now conducting further research on this secret recipe.

In 1955, the medical college admitted a patient named Xie Zhuoqun with chronic nephritis. He had edema all over his body and a lot of protein in his urine. All kinds of treatments were ineffective. At that time, the internal medicine department felt there was no way to treat him, so they advised Xie Zhuoqun to be discharged from the hospital for recuperation. After Xie was discharged, he heard that an old lady named Lu, who was seventy-six years old, could treat edema, so he sought treatment from her. As a result, after taking three doses of medicine, the edema all over his body disappeared quickly, and his appetite was particularly good.

This fact aroused great attention from the Party Committee of the Medical College. Qiao Xiaobo, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, Shi Zhongfu, Director of Internal Medicine, and Zhang Zhifan, Deputy Dean of the Affiliated Hospital, visited Old Lady Lu many times. The old lady was moved by the sincere wishes of the responsible comrades of the Party Committee of the Medical College, who came to her home time and time again for the sake of the people's health. She gladly agreed to contribute this prescription, which had been passed down for six generations in her family, as a gift to Chairman Mao for National Day.

    慢性肾脏炎有法治了
    贵阳卢老太太献出有效秘方
    本报讯　被聘为贵阳医学院祖国医学顾问的卢老太太，9月2日向贵阳医学院师生作了关于治疗慢性肾脏炎肾变性期的学术报告，详细介绍了她的配药和治疗方法。
    慢性肾脏炎肾变性期（俗称肿半截、水肿），目前世界各国还没有特效的治疗方法。贵阳市七十多岁的卢老太太最近在贵阳医学院的帮助下，献出了治疗这种疾病具有奇效的祖传秘方。
    贵阳医学院附属医院用这个秘方对四个病人作了临床试验。试验效果和老太太预计一样：病人服两副药以后，五天之内水肿全消，而且没有复肿现象。现在医学院对这个秘方正在作进一步的研究。
    1955年，医学院收了一个名叫谢卓群的慢性肾脏炎的病人，他全身水肿，尿里蛋白很多，经过各种治疗无效。当时内科认为没办法治，于是劝谢卓群出院疗养。谢出院后，打听到一位七十六岁姓卢的老太太会治水肿，便去求治。结果吃三副药以后，全身水肿很快就消了，而且胃口特别好。
    这个事实引起了医学院党委的极大重视。党委副书记乔晓波、内科主任时钟孚和附属医院张植范副院长多次拜访了卢老太太。老太太被医学院党委负责同志为人民身体健康，三番两次来到她家的殷切愿望所感动，她欣然同意把她家六辈人传下来的这个药方献出，作为国庆节给毛主席的献礼。
