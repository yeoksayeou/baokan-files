    Reaching Out in All Directions
    ——An Introduction to the Transportation Pavilion at the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition
  　By our reporter, Lin Yao
    "Local, Mass, and Universal" Line Bears Fruit

    Earlier this year, when the Ministry of Communications proposed that the construction of transportation must implement the line of "relying on the local, relying on the masses, and focusing on universality," some people held a skeptical attitude. Today, as can be seen from the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition, this correct line has blossomed and borne fruit! For example, Xinping County in Yunnan Province is a mountainous area rich in forests, minerals, and cash crops. Before liberation, there was not a single road. In 1956, the state invested more than 700,000 yuan to build a road. However, because the transportation department did not rely on the local people and widely mobilize the masses, only a 59-kilometer-long road was built. In the first half of this year, under the leadership of the county's party and government organs, the masses were earnestly mobilized, and various sideline productions were organized to solve the funding for road construction. 150 kilometers of simple roads and 280 kilometers of horse-drawn cart roads were built, bringing unprecedented prosperity to this remote mountainous area.

    The "Huaibei River Network" plan being realized by the people of Huaibei in Anhui Province is a model of relying on the masses to develop water transport. A huge model at the exhibition tells the audience that the people of Huaibei will use their own strength to dig 26 new artificial rivers with a total length of more than 1,300 kilometers and 134,500 kilometers of artificial canals on 38,000 square kilometers of land. These ditches and canals are as dense as spider webs, covering every corner of the Huaibei Plain. It can not only fully exert the function of flood discharge and regulation to ensure agricultural production, but also allow various sizes of ships to navigate within an average radius of six to eight kilometers. This grand plan can be fully realized after the autumn harvest.

    Local civil aviation has also developed along with the "local, mass, and universal" line. Starting this year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will gradually open six local trunk lines with Hohhot as the center, and open many local branch lines with Hohhot, Hailar, and Dengkou as bases to form a transportation network reaching out in all directions in order to connect all leagues and banners.

    The above are just a few very ordinary examples of relying on local people and relying on the masses to develop transportation. This year, the national water, land, and air transportation networks are extending in all directions at an unprecedented speed. It is estimated that more than 144,000 kilometers of new roads can be built across the country this year, which is equivalent to 112% of the total mileage built during the First Five-Year Plan, and also equal to twice the roads built in the old China for decades before liberation. About 50,000 kilometers of new inland river routes will be opened; civil aviation will also add more than 7,300 kilometers of new routes. This speed of development exceeds any year in our country's history, and all capitalist countries are beyond comparison.

    The Infinite Wisdom of the Masses

    In the Transportation Pavilion, people can clearly see that the technical revolution on the transportation front has yielded fruitful results. In a large photo, we see a line of cars lined up, driving on the road like a giant dragon. This is a new record created by the Beijing Long-Distance Bus Company for towing 46 vehicles and transporting 143 tons of materials at one time. According to the narrator, promoting the train-like towing of automobiles is a quick and effective way to solve the current shortage of transportation capacity.

    The extremely large and widely distributed folk transport tools are gradually advancing towards semi-mechanization and mechanization in the tide of the technological revolution. The most
  inspiring thing is the vigorous vehicle and bearing movement carried out in the vast rural areas. Within a few months, this movement has replaced the heavy physical labor of carrying on shoulders and backs for thousands of years with vehicles and ships to a great extent. The broad masses actively offered suggestions and materials, building ships and vehicles, and a moving scene of "every family is a factory, everyone is a carpenter" appeared. The various transportation tools displayed in the exhibition show that the technological revolution of rural transportation tools is advancing step by step from low-level to high-level. After vehicleization, the realization of ball bearing is closely followed; some areas have replaced wooden wheels with solid rubber or pneumatic tires after installing ball bearings; some have converted human-powered vehicles into tricycles and installed engines; and some have converted two-wheeled horse-drawn carriages into four-wheeled horse-drawn carriages. These reforms have made transportation labor easier and easier, and transportation efficiency has been continuously improved.

    The reform of wooden sailing ships is developing in the direction of adding sails to ships without sails, turning one sail into multiple sails, improving ship types, and adding power. The exhibition displays many models of improved wooden boats. Hunan Province has created the "eight-sided sail," which can use sails regardless of whether it is upwind or downwind, increasing transportation efficiency by more than double; boat people in Guangdong Province have installed a foot-powered propulsion device on wooden boats, which can sail at 10 kilometers per hour, which is faster and more labor-saving than sculling and poling. These technological innovations have been welcomed by the majority of folk transport practitioners. There are currently more than 3,000 cooperatives and more than 800,000 members in the country who are actively expanding public accumulation and carrying out technological reforms of ships.

    A Brilliant Prospect in Sight

    When visiting the last part of the Transportation Pavilion—the future of the transportation industry—people will be overjoyed. After a few years, China's transportation industry will have a beautiful scene of "large and small ports scattered like stars, rivers and canals interwoven into a network, road transport penetrating into the fields, and civil aviation spreading throughout the country." At that time, there will be highways in every township and commune, and buses will run to county towns and market towns. Advanced highways, new-style ships, buses, and trucks will also appear in large numbers, making it faster, more comfortable, and safer for people to go out for work or transport goods. An advanced three-dimensional intersection expressway introduced at the exhibition is one of them. This highway has a road surface width of 20 meters, and cars can travel on it at 120 kilometers per hour, and 1,000 cars can pass through it every day. To ensure speed and safety, the highway is divided into two layers, upper and lower, intersecting each other. As long as all vehicles travel according to a certain route, there are no traffic lights and no police officers to direct traffic, and there will be no collisions or blockages. Other things, such as the Yangtze River hydrofoil passenger ships with a speed of 60 to 70 kilometers per hour, 18,000-ton ocean-going oil tankers, and atomic-powered 10,000-ton ocean-going freighters, will also appear on China's vast Yangtze River and oceans in the near future.

    The grand plan to develop the Ten Canals attracted countless viewers. People cheered for this unprecedented great project in our country! In addition to the Grand Canal of China, which began to be restored in May this year, our country will also open up nine
  canals in the near future. They are: the Songliao Canal connecting the Songhua River and the Liaohe River, the Liaonan Canal from Anshan to Yingkou, the Jiaolai Canal connecting the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea, the Huanghan Canal connecting the Yellow River and the Han River, the Jingzheng Canal from Zhengzhou to Beijing, the Shasha Canal from Shashi to Shayang, as well as the Jianghuai Canal, the Gan Yue Canal, and the Xiang Gui Canal. These ten canals connect the seven major water systems of the Heilongjiang, Haihe River, Yellow River, Huaihe River, Yangtze River, Qiantang River, and Pearl River, and then connect with the small rivers and canals developed by each province, forming a water transport network as dense as a spider web. At that time, all kinds of materials can be massively used for cheap water transport to support industrial and agricultural production; people on vacation can travel by boat from east to west and from south to north to visit all parts of the motherland.

    Dear readers, you may feel that taking an airplane is not easy at present. But a few years later, with the development of civil aviation, using this means of transportation will also be very common. At that time, routes will be opened from the heart of the motherland—Beijing—to the provincial capitals, autonomous region capitals, and major cities, forming domestic aviation trunk lines; large, fast passenger planes will be widely used on long-distance trunk lines to open day and night flights, so that round trips can be made on the same day. In the future, each provincial capital and autonomous region capital will also widely open local route networks to undertake short-distance transportation tasks to the main economic areas of the province.

    四通八达
    ——全国工业交通展览会交通馆介绍
  　本报记者　林耀
    “地、群、普”路线开花结果
    今年上半年，当交通部提出在交通建设上必须执行“依靠地方、依靠群众、以普及为主”的路线时，曾经有人抱着怀疑的态度。今天从全国工业交通展览会上可以看出，这条正确的路线已经开花结果了！例如，云南省新平县是一个森林矿产、经济作物丰富的山区，解放前没有一条公路，1956年由国家投资七十多万元开始修筑公路，但是由于交通部门没有依靠地方和广泛发动群众，结果仅修了一条五十九公里长的公路；今年上半年在县的党政机关领导下，认真发动群众，组织多种副业生产来解决筑路的经费，修成了一百五十公里简易公路和二百八十公里马车路，使这个偏僻山区出现从来未有的繁荣景象。
    安徽淮北地区人民正在实现着的“淮北河网化”的规划，是依靠群众发展水运交通的典范。展览会的一个巨大的模型告诉观众，淮北人民将要用自己的力量，在三万八千平方公里的土地上，挖出二十六条长度达一千三百多公里的人工新河和十三万四千五百公里的人工渠道。这些沟河渠道像蜘蛛网一样，密布在淮北平原的每个角落。它不仅能充分发挥排洪调节作用，保证农业生产，而且在平均六至八公里的周围以内，都可以通航各种大小轮船。这个宏伟的规划在秋收以后就可以全部实现了。
    地方民用航空事业也随着“地、群、普”路线发展起来了。内蒙古自治区从今年起就要以呼和浩特为中心，逐步开辟六条地方干线，并以呼和浩特、海拉尔、磴口为基地，开辟很多地方支线，组成一个四通八达的地方航空网，做到盟盟相通、旗旗相连。
    以上这些不过是依靠地方、依靠群众发展交通事业的几个极普通的事例。今年全国水、陆、空运输网都在以从来未有的速度向四面八方伸展。预计今年全国新修公路可以达到十四万四千多公里，相当于第一个五年计划修建总里程的112％，也等于解放前旧中国几十年中修建的公路的二倍。新辟内河航线约五万公里；民用航空也将增加七千三百多公里的新航线。这个发展速度超过了我国历史上的任何一年，一切资本主义国家更是望尘莫及。
    群众无穷的智慧
    在交通馆，人们可以明显地看到交通运输战线的技术革命已经结出丰硕的果实。在一幅大照片上，我们看到一列汽车列队，像一条巨龙似的在公路上行驶。这是北京市长途汽车公司创造的一次拖挂四十六辆车、运输物资一百四十三吨的新纪录。据讲解人员说，推行汽车拖带列车化，是解决当前运输力量不足的一个立竿见影的好办法。
    数量极大、分布极广的民间运输工具在技术革命的浪潮中，正在逐步向半机械化、机械化进军。最
  振奋人心的，是广大农村轰轰烈烈开展的车子化、轴承化运动。这个运动在几个月之内，就把几千年来的肩挑背负的繁重体力劳动在很大的程度上用车、船代替了。广大群众在运动中踊跃献计，献料，造船，造车，出现了“家家是工厂，人人是木匠”的动人景象。展览会陈列的各种运输工具，说明农村运输工具的技术革命正在从低级到高级，一步接一步地前进。车子化以后，紧接着实现滚珠轴承化；有的地区在装上滚珠轴承后，又把木轮改钉硬胶或换上汽轮；有的把人力车改为三轮车，并装上了发动机；有的把两轮马车改为四轮马车。这些改革使运输劳动越来越减轻，使运输效率不断提高。
    木帆船的改革正在向着无帆加帆、一帆变多帆、改良船型、加装动力等方向发展。展览会陈列了很多改良木船的模型。湖南省创造了“八面风帆”，不论顺风逆风都能用帆，使运输效率提高了一倍多；广东省的船民把木船上装一个脚踏推进装置，每小时能航行十公里，比摇橹和撑篙快而省力。这些技术革新，受到广大民间运输业从业人
  员的欢迎。全国现有的三千多个合
  作社、八十多万社员正在积极扩大公共积累，进行船舶的技术改革。
    灿烂的远景在望
    参观到交通馆的最后一部分——交通运输业的远景，人们都会心花怒放。几年之后，我国交通运输业将出现一幅“大小港口星罗棋布，河流渠道交织成网、公路运输深入田间，民用航空遍布全国”的美景。那时可以做到乡乡社社有公路，县城集镇通班车。高级公路、新式轮船、客车、货车也将大量出现，使人们出外工作或运输货物更迅速、更舒适、更安全。展览会上介绍的一种高级立体交叉的快速公路就是其中的一种。这种公路路面宽二十公尺，汽车在上面行驶每小时可走一百二十公里，每天可通过一千辆汽车。为了保证迅速、安全，公路分上下两层，互相交叉，所有的车辆只要按着一定的路线行驶，没有指挥灯，不用民警指挥，也不会发生撞车、堵塞的现象。其他如每小时航速六十到七十公里的长江水翼客船、一万八千吨的远洋油船、原子能万吨远洋货轮等，不久的将来也都会在我国辽阔的长江和海洋上出现。
    宏伟的开发十大运河的规划，吸引了无数的观众。人们都为我国这史无前例的伟大工程而欢呼！除去今年5月开始修复的南北大运河以外，不久的将来我国还要开辟九
  条运河，这就是：贯通松花江和辽河两大水系的松辽运河、从鞍山到营口的辽南运河、贯通渤海与黄海的胶莱运河、贯通黄河与汉水的黄汉运河、从郑州到北京的京郑运河、从沙市到沙洋的沙沙运河以及江淮运河、赣粤运河、湘桂运河，这十条运河把黑龙江、海河、黄河、淮河、长江、钱塘江、珠江等七大水系一脉相连、再与各省开发的小河、渠道相接，就构成了一个密如蛛网的水运网。那时，各种物资都可以大量利用廉价的水上运输去支援工农业生产；休假的人们可以从东到西，从南到北坐着轮船到祖国各地去参观游览。
    亲爱的读者，你们在目前也许会感到坐飞机是一件不容易的事。但是几年之后随着民用航空事业的发展，利用这种运输工具也是很平常的事了。那时，从祖国的心脏——北京到各省会、自治区首府和各大城市都开辟了航线，形成国内航空干线；在远程的干线上将普遍采用大型的快速客机，开辟昼夜航班，做到当天来回。将来各省省会、自治区首府到这个省区的一些主要经济地区，还要普遍开辟地方航线网担负短程运输任务。
