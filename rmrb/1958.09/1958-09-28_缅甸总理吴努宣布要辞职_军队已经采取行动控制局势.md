Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 26th: Burmese Prime Minister U Nu delivered a broadcast address to the nation this evening, announcing his resignation and requesting that General Ne Win, Chief of Staff of the Burmese Defense Forces, assume the position of new Prime Minister. U Nu stated that Ne Win had accepted his request.

U Nu said that he had originally intended to hold a general election in November of this year. However, he said, "In view of the domestic situation and the series of events that have occurred, we cannot but conclude that the general election to be held in November may be neither free nor fair."

U Nu then read a letter he wrote to Ne Win on the same day. In the letter, U Nu said that in order to hold a general election in April 1959, he hoped that Ne Win would serve as Prime Minister. U Nu stated that he would request a parliamentary session on October 28th to submit his resignation and elect Ne Win as Prime Minister.

U Nu requested in the letter that Ne Win pursue a strict policy of peaceful neutrality and achieve domestic peace. He also said that the (Clean) Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, which he leads, has decided not to participate in the cabinet. U Nu requested that Ne Win's cabinet ensure that the military does not use violence, pays attention to eliminating criminal behavior, and guarantees the fairness and reasonableness of the general election.

Ne Win wrote back to U Nu on the same day, stating that he accepted U Nu's proposal. In his reply, he stated that he would never abandon the strict policy of neutrality and would do his best to achieve domestic peace. He also stated that he would not absorb representatives of Burmese political parties into his cabinet and accepted the other requirements put forward by U Nu.

Prior to U Nu's broadcast address, the military led by Ne Win had already taken action across the country. The army took over security work in major cities and took over all armories, including police armories. Strategic locations inside and outside Rangoon, airports, police headquarters, etc., are all under the control of the army. Fully armed soldiers, military police, civil police, etc., are conducting strict inspections of all travelers and vehicles.

In June of this year, the ruling Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma officially announced its split. The U Nu-Thakin Tin faction formed the (Clean) Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League; the Ba Swe-Kyaw Nyein faction withdrew from the cabinet and formed the (Stable) Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. There was fierce fighting between the two factions. On August 19, U Nu issued a statement announcing his readiness to dissolve parliament and hold a general election.

    缅甸总理吴努宣布要辞职
    军队已经采取行动控制局势
    新华社仰光26日电  缅甸总理吴努今天晚上向全国发表广播演说，宣布他将辞职，并且要求缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温将军出任新总理。吴努说，奈温已经接受他的要求。
    吴努说，他本来打算在今年11月举行大选。但是他说，“鉴于国内存在的情况和所发生的一连串事件，我们不能不得出结论说，11月份举行的大选可能既不是自由的，也不是公正的。”
    吴努接着宣读了他在当天写给奈温的一封信。吴努在信中说，为了在1959年4月举行大选，他希望奈温出任总理。吴努表示，他将要求在10月28日召开议会会议，提出辞职，并且推选奈温为总理。
    吴努在信中要求奈温奉行严格的和平中立政策和取得国内和平。他还说，他所领导的（纯洁的）反法西斯人民自由同盟决定不参加内阁。吴努要求奈温内阁保证军队不要使用暴力、注意消灭犯罪行为，以保证大选的公平合理。
    奈温在当天写复信给吴努，表示接受吴努的建议。他在复信中表示决不放弃严格的中立政策和尽力取得国内和平，他还表示将不吸收缅甸各政党的代表参加他的内阁，并且接受了吴努提出的其他各项要求。
    在吴努发表广播演说以前，奈温率领的军队已经在全国采取了行动。陆军接管了各大城市的治安工作，接管了一切军火库，其中包括警察的武器库。仰光城内外的战略据点、机场、警察总部等都在陆军的控制之下。全副武装的军队、宪兵、民警等对所有的旅客、车辆进行严格的检查。
    今年6月间，缅甸执政的反法西斯人民自由同盟正式宣告分裂。吴努—德钦丁派组成了（纯洁的）反法西斯人民自由同盟；吴巴瑞—吴觉迎派退出了内阁，组成了（巩固的）反法西斯人民自由同盟。两派之间进行了激烈的斗争。8月19日，吴努发表声明，宣布准备解散国会和举行大选。
