Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 16th: The people of Hebei Province, famous for their guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines during the Anti-Japanese War, are now, with anger against American imperialist aggression, stepping up the realization of universal armament, ready at any time to strike at the aggressors. Currently, 81 counties and cities in the province have implemented universal military service, with the total number of militia reaching more than seven million.

This large army that combines labor and military affairs is organized with militiamen and demobilized soldiers as the backbone, and militia organizations and various production organizations as the foundation. This great army includes workers, farmers, students, commercial workers, and government cadres. Chengde Prefecture, while establishing people's communes, also built 26 corps, totaling more than one million militiamen.

At present, the militia in various places are implementing the "combination of labor and military affairs" and launching large-scale military training. The county military service bureaus have helped the militia train more than 130,000 military instructors to lead the militia in military studies. In Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Handan and other prefectures alone, more than 340,000 militiamen have participated in the large-scale military training. Many battalions, companies, platoons, and squads gather their members at dawn every day for collective military training, then carry their guns to the fields, put down their guns to work, and pick up their guns to practice martial arts during breaks. The Dongfanghong People's Commune in Zhangbei County, on the Bashang grassland outside the Great Wall, organized cavalry. They ride horses to work every day, and practice military affairs after work, showing the might of the knights outside the Great Wall. Many areas have also launched "all-red" campaigns in training, proposing the slogan "The field is the classroom, the fields and construction sites are the training grounds, seize the gaps to aim three or five shots, learn skills well and keep them on your body, ready to strike the American wolf at any time." More than 25,000 militiamen in Baoding Prefecture are carrying out large-scale military training in conjunction with the construction of reservoirs. They carry tools in their hands and guns on their shoulders when going to work, and take time to aim three or five shots during breaks. After training, 79 militiamen in Shuangbei Township, Longyao County, achieved excellent overall scores in live ammunition shooting. Twenty-five female militiamen from Chengguan Township in Wuqiao County participated in live ammunition shooting, and 24 of them also achieved excellent results.

    河北实现全民皆兵
    民兵总数超过七百万人
    新华社天津16日电　在抗日战争中坚持敌后平原游击战著名的河北省人民，现在又怀着反对美帝国主义侵略的怒火，加紧实现全民武装，随时准备打击侵略者。目前，全省已有八十一个县市实行了全民皆兵，民兵的总数达到七百多万人。
    这支劳武结合的大军，是以民兵、复员军人为骨干，以民兵组织和各种生产组织为基础组织起来的。在这支大军中，包括有工人、农民、学生、商业工作者和机关干部。承德专区各县在建立人民公社的同时，结合建成了二十六个兵团，共有民兵一百多万人。
    目前，各地民兵实行“劳武结合”，展开了大练兵。各县兵役局已帮助民兵训练了十三万多名军事教员，领导民兵进行军事学习。仅张家口、承德、邯郸等专区，参加大练兵的就有三十四万多民兵。许多营、连、排、班每天拂晓就把队员集合起来，进行集体军事训练，然后背起枪奔赴田间，放下枪就劳动，休息时又拿起枪杆练武。塞外坝上草原的张北县东方红人民公社组织了骑兵，他们每天骑着马上地，下工以后又骑马练兵，显示了塞外骑士的威风。很多地区在练兵中还展开了“满堂红”运动，提出“地头是课堂，田间、工地是操场，抓紧空隙瞄三、五枪，学好本领在身上，随时准备打击美国狼”的口号。保定专区的二万五千多民兵，结合修水库进行大练兵。他们在上工时手拿工具肩背枪，一到休息时间便抓空瞄三、五枪。隆尧县双碑乡七十九名民兵经过训练后，实弹射击总评达到优秀。吴桥县城关乡的妇女民兵连二十五人参加实弹射击，也有二十四人达到了优秀。
