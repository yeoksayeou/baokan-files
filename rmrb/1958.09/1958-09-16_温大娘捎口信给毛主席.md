Granny Wen Sends a Message to Chairman Mao
袁鹰

In March of this year, when the spring was just beginning to show its colors on the Chengdu Plain, Chairman Mao visited two agricultural cooperatives. This happy news spread like a warm east wind, immersing everyone in an unparalleled sense of happiness. Afterward, two folk songs circulated on the Chengdu Plain:

    Stars densely packed in the sky,
    The people's leader comes to the countryside.
    Scattering a large bag of seeds,
    Happy flowers bloom everywhere.

Now, let's talk about Granny Wen's home in the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative of Hexing Township, Pi County. Granny Wen's name is Lin Saihua, and she is fifty-seven years old this year. On the afternoon of March 16th, Chairman Mao sat in her house for half an hour. More than five months have passed, and she remembers every detail of that happy half-hour, every word and action of the Chairman, clearly. For more than five months, she doesn't know how many times she's talked about it with others. Whenever anyone mentions it, she always tells it in detail, gesturing as if everyone who was there at the time is still crammed into the room. She holds a water pipe—the very pipe she offered Chairman Mao to smoke that day—and repeats the story over and over, sharing her happiness with others.

"Chairman Mao sat right here," Granny Wen says, pointing to a long bench beside the square table. The ebony square table and bench seem to be the fruits of liberation. They are spotless and gleaming; Granny Wen's home, inside and out, is clean and tidy, maintained in the same order as when the Chairman visited.

The day the Chairman came, Granny Wen was suffering from "火巴眼" (an eye ailment), unable to clearly recognize the guest who came to her house. She first saw a comrade in a gray-blue suit, a burly fellow, enter the room, and thought he was a comrade from the county. Later, she heard this guest asking this and that, with an accent she couldn't quite understand. The Chairman went into the inner room, saw a fire basket on the cabinet, and asked what it was. Granny Wen thought: this comrade must not be from this province, so she asked: "Old comrade, which province are you from?"

As soon as she asked this, everyone in the room laughed softly. The Chairman also laughed and asked her to sit down, saying in Sichuan dialect, "Shall we chat a bit?"

Sitting in front of Chairman Mao, Granny Wen vaguely saw the guest's face, and also faintly saw a mole on his chin. Granny Wen's heart stirred, thinking: this comrade does look a bit like Chairman Mao. Could it be that he is Chairman Mao? No, how could it be, Chairman Mao is busy with national affairs, what would he be doing in our thatched cottage!

At that moment, their cooperative chairman, Zhou Guilin, was sitting next to her. Old Zhou was both happy and anxious for Granny Wen. Granny Wen used to be a poor peasant, suffering for most of her life. If it had been before liberation, who would come to see her when she had "火巴眼"! But today, the leader of all the Chinese people, the great benefactor of our peasants, has come to her home, what a blessing! Old Zhou wanted to tell her several times: "This is Chairman Mao!" But the Chairman was asking Granny Wen how her family was doing, whether four hundred catties of grain was enough to eat, whether the cooperative chairman treated them well, what the benefits of eliminating the "Seven Pests" were, and he even praised her for understanding scientific knowledge… All these questions distracted Old Zhou.

Granny Wen didn't hear that it was Chairman Mao until the guest walked out the door. She hurried to the edge of the vegetable garden, but the Chairman was already on his way.

"Why didn't you tell me earlier! If I had known it was Chairman Mao, I would have had so much more to tell him!"

This can perhaps be considered a small regret in a great happiness. When Granny Wen talked to us about it, she said with regret:

"It would have been so much better if I hadn't had "火巴眼" then!"

At this time, a group of children were gathered around the table, listening to Granny Wen talk about Chairman Mao's visit. In fact, they had heard these stories countless times. Granny Wen wanted to scold them away, but no one left, and they even made some annotations to Granny Wen's narration.

"Chairman Mao touched this child's head and asked him how old he was. This child, he doesn't say a word when strangers come."

She was referring to her grandson, named Wen Chuanbing. Wen Chuanbing was a little embarrassed when his grandmother said this, and he blushed and defended himself:

"I answered!"

Grandma said with a smile: "You answered afterward, Chairman Mao didn't hear you."

Little Wen Chuanbing had no choice but to be silent. Another child softly sang:

    Happy Township, Happy Cooperative,
    Happy Garden, Happy Field,
    Happy people………

This "Happy Garden" is Granny Wen's vegetable garden, which is no longer planted with vegetables. It is now planted with cannas, balsams, tuberoses, and butterfly flowers, and in the middle is a iron tree. This was planted together by the cooperative members. They said: we want to turn this place into a colorful garden, so that passers-by will always remember the happiness given by Chairman Mao.

We were preparing to say goodbye. Granny Wen said:

"Comrade, if you go back to Beijing, please give Chairman Mao a message!

"It's been half a year since Chairman Mao came, and there isn't a day that we don't think of him, we're always remembering him in our hearts.

"Since Chairman Mao came, our team no longer works so loosely like before. Men and women are working day and night in production. Our spring harvest was two and a half times more than last year. In our cooperative, the early rice yielded an average of 1,400 catties per mu. We have already written to tell the Chairman."

Chairman Mao saw a pig at Granny Wen's house. He asked who raised it, and Granny Wen said she raised it. The Chairman said with a smile: "How about raising another one?" Now, she has sold that pig and bought two piglets. There is an orange tree in the yard, which the Chairman also asked about, and it is now bearing fruit.

"I'm still sick now, just waiting for my illness to get better, and then I'll work hard in production. I thought of an idea: I am from Neijiang, and Neijiang produces sweet potatoes, but we don't grow sweet potatoes in our cooperative. After the Chairman came, the cooperative called for increased production, so I planted seven mu of sweet potatoes, and this is still planted according to the old methods. In the autumn, I want to go back to Neijiang and learn the new methods of planting sweet potatoes there, and promote them in our cooperative.

"Chairman Mao, I have so many things in my heart, I just can't say them all at once!"

We shared Granny Wen's happiness, carried her message, and bid her farewell. On the Chengdu Plain, there is an endless expanse of good paddy fields, the mid-season rice is about to be harvested, and the late rice is already two or three feet high. In the experimental fields of the Hongguang Cooperative Party Branch Secretary, the densely packed rice is growing vigorously. This land is planned to yield 40,000 catties per mu. The members of the Hongguang Cooperative, like everyone on the Chengdu Plain, are full of excitement and confidence, preparing to bring more and greater good news to Chairman Mao.

### 温大娘捎口信给毛主席

    温大娘捎口信给毛主席
    袁鹰
    今年3月，川西平原上春意初浓的时节，毛主席曾经访问过两个农业社，这喜讯顿时像一阵和煦的东风，吹得人人都沉浸在无法比拟的幸福感里。过后，在川西平原上流传着两首民歌：
    天上星星密密排，  
    人民领袖下乡来，
    撒下种子一大袋，  
    幸福花儿朵朵开。
    如今且说郫县合兴乡红光农业社的温大娘家。温大娘名叫林赛华，今年五十七岁了。3月16日下午，毛主席在她家坐了半个多小时，五个多月过去了，那个幸福的半小时里的一切细节，主席的一言一动，她都记得清清楚楚。五个多月来，也不知道同多少人摆过了，不管什么时候，只要谁一提起，她总是详详细细地说着，比划着，好像所有当时在场的人仍然挤满一屋。她捧个水烟袋——就是那天她还请毛主席抽烟的烟袋——，一遍又一遍地说着，把自己的幸福分给旁人。
    “毛主席就坐在这里。”温大娘指着方桌边的一条长凳。乌木的方桌和长凳，看来是翻身果实。它们一尘不染，还闪着光；温大娘家里里外外，都是干干净净，保持着主席来时的同样整洁。
    主席来的那天，温大娘正闹“火巴眼”没有认清到她家里来的客人是谁。她先看见一个穿青灰色衣服、身体魁梧的同志走进屋里，以为是县里的同志，后来听见这位客人问这问那，口音不完全听得懂。主席走进里屋，看见柜上放着火笼，又问这是什么。温大娘心想：这位同志一定不是本省人，就问了一句：“老同志，你是哪省来的？”
    这话一问，满屋子的人都轻轻地笑了。主席也笑了，就请她坐下来，用四川话说：“我们摆一摆好不好？”
    坐到毛主席面前，温大娘才模模糊糊地看清这位客人的面容，也隐隐约约地看到他下颚上有一颗痣。温大娘心里一动，想：这位同志倒有点像毛主席哩。未必他就是毛主席？不，哪里会，毛主席处理国家大事忙得很哩，他到我们这茅草篷里来做啥子哟！
    那当儿，她们的社长周桂林就坐在她旁边。老周心里又高兴，又替温大娘发急。温大娘早先是贫农，苦了大半辈子，要是掉在解放前，生了火巴眼，有哪个来看她哟！可是今天，全中国人民的领袖，我们农民的大恩人都到她家来了，真是她的福气！老周几次想告诉她：“这是毛主席呀！”可是主席那阵儿正在问温大娘家里过得怎么样，四百斤粮食够吃不够吃，问她社长对她们好不好，问她除七害有什么好处，还称赞她懂得科学知识……几下子一来！把老周的心思也岔开了。
    温大娘直到客人走出门，才听别人告诉她是毛主席，她慌慌忙忙地赶到菜园边，主席已经上了路了。
    “你们咋早点不说嘛！我要是早知道是毛主席，还有多少多少话要告诉他老人家哩！”
    这大约可算是巨大幸福中的小遗憾吧。温大娘在同我们谈起的时候，还不无憾然地说：
    “要是那阵不生火巴眼多好！”
    这时候，一群孩子正围在桌边，听着温大娘摆毛主席来的事，其实这些他们也听过多个遍了。温大娘想把他们?喝开，可是谁也不走，还给温大娘的叙述做些注解哩。
    “毛主席摸了这孩子的头，问他几岁，这孩子呀，有生人来就不啃声了。”
    她指着的是她的孙子，叫温传冰。温传冰听奶奶这么一说，有点难为情，红着脸辩白说：
    “我应了嘛。”
    奶奶笑着说：“你过后才应，毛主席都没有听到。”
    小温传冰只好不响了。另外一个孩却轻轻地唱起来：
    幸福乡，幸福社，
    幸福花园幸福田，
    幸福人………
    这“幸福花园”就是温大娘家里的菜园子，现在不种菜了，栽满了美人蕉、凤仙、晚香玉、蝴蝶花，当中是一棵铁甲松。这是社员们一起来栽的，他们说：要把这块地变成五彩的花园，让来往行人都永远记住毛主席给的幸福。
    我们准备告辞了。温大娘说：
    “同志，你要是回北京，给我捎个口信给毛主席吧！
    “毛主席来了半年了，我们没有哪天不想他老人家，时时刻刻都在默到哩。
    “毛主席来过以后，我们这一队，干活再不像以前那样松夸夸的了，男男女女，日日夜夜都在搞生产。我们的小春，比去年多收了两倍半。我们社里，早稻平均一亩打了一千四百多斤。我们已经写信告诉主席了。”
    毛主席在温大娘家看到一头猪，他问是哪个养的，温大娘说是她养的。主席笑着说：“再养一头好不好？”现在，她已经把那头猪卖了，买了两头小猪。院子里有棵橘子树，也是主席问过的，现在已经结果子了。
    “我现在还有病，只等病一好，我就好好搞生产。我想到个主意：我是内江人，内江出红苕，可是我们社里没种红苕。主席来过以后，社里号召增产，我就栽了七亩红苕，这还是按过去老法子栽的。秋后我要回内江去一趟，把那里栽红苕的新法子学来，在我们社里推广推广。
    “毛主席呀，我的心里想到好多事，就是一下子说不完啊！”
    我们分享着温大娘的幸福，捎着她的口信，告别她出来。川西平原上，一望无尽的好稻田，中稻快收完了，晚稻也长了两三尺高。在红光社党支部书记的试验田里，密密麻麻的稻子长得精神焕发，这块地计划亩产四万斤。红光社的社员们，跟川西平原上每个人一样，满怀着兴奋和信心，准备把更多更大的喜讯捎给毛主席。
