Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: U.S. Pacific Command Commander Felt held military talks with Chiang Kai-shek in Taipei today. According to U.S. news agencies, "Observers believe that one of the purposes of the talks is to study the results of the recent U.S. strengthening of jet aircraft and nuclear weapons in Taiwan, as well as the U.S. Seventh Fleet's escorting of Kuomintang supply ships to Kinmen."

Felt held talks with Chiang Kai-shek the day after convening a meeting of U.S. military generals in Taipei on the 22nd. Prior to this meeting, news dispatches from Washington and New York by Western news agencies indicated that senior officials in the White House and Pentagon had studied the issue of driving Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous troops to conduct air raids and other harassment and sabotage against the Chinese mainland. Western news agencies said that senior U.S. military officers and senior officers of the Chiang bandit troops held a meeting on the 22nd, also discussing methods of conducting air raids against the Chinese mainland "when necessary."

In recent times, U.S. imperialism has increased the equipment provided to Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous troops. In less than a month, the United States has already supplied Chiang bandit troops with 90 million U.S. dollars worth of military supplies. In the fiscal year from July of this year to June of next year, the "aid" given by the United States to Chiang bandit troops may reach 300 million U.S. dollars. U.S. armed interventionists are not only supplying Chiang bandit troops with light weapons, artillery equipment, ammunition, and landing craft, but recently, after supplying a batch of F-100 jet fighters to the Chiang bandit air force, they have also supplied three warships. These three warships arrived at Zuoying, Taiwan from the Ryukyu Islands on the 22nd, joining the Chiang bandit naval fleet.

U.S. aggressors are doing their utmost to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Kinmen and Matsu, so that the Chiang bandit troops can occupy these islands as a springboard for the U.S. to invade the Chinese mainland. Recently, U.S. warmongers have been trying every possible means to transport more weapons and ammunition into Kinmen, so that the Chiang bandit troops can continue to commit heinous crimes such as shelling Xiamen University before being annihilated. The Chinese people express extreme indignation at all conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to use the Chiang Kai-shek clique to attempt to invade the Chinese mainland.

### 加紧策划对我国的战争挑衅  美蒋在台湾举行军事会谈

    加紧策划对我国的战争挑衅
    美蒋在台湾举行军事会谈
    新华社23日讯　美国太平洋地区部队总司令费耳特今天在台北同蒋介石举行了军事会谈。据美国通讯社的消息说，“观察家认为会谈目的之一是研究美国最近在台湾加强喷气飞机和核武器的力量的结果，以及美国第七舰队护送国民党供应船前往金门的结果。”
    费耳特是在22日在台北召开了美军将领会议后，次日和蒋介石会谈的。在这次会谈前，西方国家的通讯社从华盛顿和纽约发出的消息，表明美国白宫和五角大楼的高级官员们，都曾研究驱使蒋介石卖国军队向中国大陆进行空袭等骚扰破坏的问题。西方通讯社说，在台湾的美国高级军官和蒋贼军高级军官在22日举行了会议，也讨论了“在需要时”向中国大陆空袭的方法。
    最近时期以来，美帝国主义增加了对蒋介石卖国军队的装备。在最近不到一个月的时间内，美国已经供给蒋贼军九千万美元的军事物资。而在从今年7月到明年6月这一会计年度中，美国给予蒋贼军的“援助”可能达三亿美元。美国武装干涉者不但把轻武器、炮兵装备、弹药、登陆艇等供给蒋贼军，最近在把一批F—100型喷气机供给蒋贼空军以后，又供给三艘军舰。这三艘军舰在22日从琉球岛驶抵台湾左营，加入蒋贼海军舰队序列。
    美国侵略者竭力企图阻挠中国人民解放金门、马祖，以便蒋贼军盘踞这些岛屿，作为美国进攻中国大陆的跳板。最近，美国战争贩子千方百计企图把更多的武器弹药运进金门，以便蒋贼军在被歼灭前继续犯下炮轰厦门大学一类的滔天罪行。中国人民对美帝国主义利用蒋介石集团妄图进犯中国大陆的一切阴谋，表示非常激愤。
