To Comrade Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Comrade Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Comrade Pham Van Dong, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam:

On the occasion of the 13th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, we, on behalf of the entire Chinese people, extend our warm congratulations to you and the entire Vietnamese people.

Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the hardworking Vietnamese people have overcome numerous difficulties, carried out democratic reforms, and victoriously accomplished the arduous task of restoring the national economy. Now, the Vietnamese people are advancing towards socialism with new strides. The unremitting efforts made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to continuously strengthen the unity among the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union and to closely maintain friendly relations with Asian and African countries are of great significance for safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people feel boundless joy for the brilliant achievements attained by the fraternal Vietnamese people.

In the past year, the traditional fraternal friendship and cooperative relations between the people of China and Vietnam have greatly developed. The Chinese government and the Chinese people fully support the unremitting efforts and all the steps taken by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people to realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland and to resolutely implement the Geneva Accords. We firmly believe that the great struggle of the Vietnamese people for the independence, unity, and construction of their motherland will surely achieve complete victory.

May the long-standing traditional friendship between the people of China and Vietnam last forever!

　　Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong
　　Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, Liu Shaoqi
