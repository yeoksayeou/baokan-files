Academic Trends

    In recent months, the Institute of History One and Two of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have launched criticisms of the works of right-wing elements in the fields of philosophy and social sciences, such as Wu Feng, Li Xun, and Zhang Dainian, as well as bourgeois scholars such as Chen Yinque, Cen Zhongmian, Feng Youlan, and He Lin.
    In "The History of the Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties," Wu Feng eulogized emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, exaggerated the role of individuals in history, slandered peasant uprisings, provoked ethnic relations, undermined ethnic unity, and negated the decisive role of the economic base and the laws of historical development. In "The History of the Ming and Qing Dynasties," Li Xun concentratedly exposed his anti-people stance and viewpoints when analyzing class relations, class contradictions, and ideology. The book is full of confused concepts, contradictions, and patchwork, pretending to know what he does not know. The two institutes thoroughly criticized the works of Wu Feng and Li Xun and wrote critical articles, which are being prepared for publication.
    Cen Zhongmian's "History of the Sui and Tang Dynasties" is a typical work of idealist historical view. The criticism of "History of the Sui and Tang Dynasties" focuses on the following four main issues: confusing the distinction between the economic base and the superstructure, fundamentally obliterating the relationship between the two; explaining the accidental and inevitable in dialectical materialism with an idealist viewpoint, and abusing this concept to explain historical problems; incorrect views on peasant uprisings; and groundlessly exaggerating that Chinese culture has accepted the culture and customs of the Turkic people since the Zhou Dynasty.
    Criticism of Chen Yinque, the "banner" of the bourgeois historical circle, has already begun. The initial criticism is mainly aimed at his denial of class struggle, exaggeration of the role of individuals in history, worship of foreign culture, and incorrect assessment of the cultural heritage of the motherland. As for systematic and more in-depth criticism, it will be carried out next year.

    科学院历史一、二所批判资产阶级学术思想
    近几个月来，中国科学院历史一、二所，分别对哲学社会科学界的右派分子吴枫、李洵、张岱年以及资产阶级学者陈寅恪、岑仲勉、冯友兰、贺麟等人的著作展开了批判。
    吴枫在“隋唐五代史”中，对帝王将相歌功颂德、夸大了个人在历史上的作用；诬蔑农民起义；挑拨民族关系、破坏民族团结；否定经济基础的决定作用及历史发展规律。李洵在“明清史”中，在分析到阶级关系、阶级矛盾以及意识形态等问题时，集中地暴露了他反人民的立场和观点。书中概念混乱，矛盾百出，东拼西凑，强不知以为知。这两个所对吴枫、李洵这两部著作进行了彻底的批判，并写成批判文章，准备发表。
    资产阶级学者岑仲勉的“隋唐史”是一本典型的唯心史观的著作。对“隋唐史”的批判，针对以下四个主要问题进行：混淆经济基础和上层建筑的区别，根本抹杀两者的关系；以唯心主义观点解释辩证唯物主义中的偶然性和必然性，并滥用这一概念来说明历史问题；对农民起义的不正确看法；毫无根据地夸大中国文化从周以来就接受了突厥族的文化、风俗的影响。
    对资产阶级史学界的“旗帜”陈寅恪的批判，目前已经开始。主要针对他的否认阶级斗争，夸大个人在历史上的作用，崇拜外国文化，对祖国文化遗产的不正确的估价等错误观点进行初步批判，至于有系统的、更深入的批判，将在明年进行。
