According to the Southern Daily News, after twenty-three days and nights of hard work, the Guangzhou Shipyard built a new converter on September 19, currently the largest in Guangdong Province, and trial-produced the first batch of high-carbon steel of good quality. Laboratory analysis at the furnace site proved a carbon content of 1.15%. This converter is one of four groups of converters currently under construction at the Guangzhou Shipyard, with a capacity of ten tons. Once put into production, it can produce hundreds of tons of steel per day under normal circumstances.

After this furnace is put into production, the other three groups of steelmaking converters with the same capacity will also be completed and put into production in the near future. In this way, according to the plan, this factory can produce at least 60,000 tons of steel for the country this year, which is almost a quarter of the planned steel output of the entire Guangdong province this year.

    广东最大的转炉出钢
    据南方日报消息  经过二十三个昼夜的苦战，广州造船厂在9月19日新建成一座目前广东省最大的转炉，并试炼出第一炉质量良好的高炭钢，炉旁化验证明，含碳1.15％。这个转炉是广州造船厂正在建设的四组转炉的一个，容积十吨。投入生产之后，在正常情况下，每天可以出钢数百吨。
    在这个炉投入生产后，另外三组同样容积的炼钢转炉也将在最近相继建成并投入生产。这样，按计划今年内这个厂就可以至少为国家生产六万吨钢，几乎等于今年广东全省计划钢产量的四分之一。
