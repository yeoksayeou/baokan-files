    Red Xushui (Four Poems)
    Huang Yanpei
  Presented upon leaving Xushui in September 1958

  (1) Red Xushui! From ancient times, it has been called a "city of heroes." People still talk about the stories of "Jing Ke" and "Yang Yanzhao." During the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, it demonstrated the loyal, courageous, and tenacious fighting spirit of millions. From then on, the Chinese Communist Party and the people of Xushui established a flesh-and-blood relationship. Now, with "hard work through winter and spring, a comprehensive Great Leap Forward," Red Xushui! Please allow me to give a big thumbs-up.

  (2) Red Xushui! The most unforgettable day was when our beloved Chairman Mao personally came. More than 300,000 people thanked Chairman Mao. How did everyone want to repay him? Only by wholeheartedly accepting the leadership of the Party, and immediately setting off a high tide of people's communes. One commune per township, organization militarized, action combative, life collectivized! Look! Look! Written on the whitewashed walls are the songs of the people of Xushui: "Walked a half-life on a single-plank bridge, now stepping onto a bright road."

  (3) People's communes are truly good! Red Xushui! We personally saw the sparks of steel being released from one blast furnace after another; personally saw young men and women combining labor and military affairs; personally saw crops that were both tall and large after deep plowing and close planting; personally saw the cows, sheep, pigs, and horses that were very hygienic; personally saw the groups of chubby babies smiling happily in the kindergartens; personally saw the happy old men and women in the Houses of Happiness. They help each other, respect and love each other, Red Xushui! Socialism has taken a step forward. If these aren't the spirit of communism, what are they?

  (4) Red Xushui! Who leads everything? It is the Communist Party. Red Xushui! It is the prototype of a New China. Who is relying on for the all-round Great Leap Forward of the New China? It is the Communist Party. Who is relied upon to ensure world peace? It is the Communist Party. Red Xushui! After comparing the past and present, they innocently sing: "In the past, believing in gods starved us, now relying on the Party, the granaries are full."

    红徐水（四首）
    黄炎培
  1958年9月来徐水临别留赠（一）红徐水！从古以来，被称“英雄城市”。人们还在说“荆卿”故事，“杨六郎”故事。抗日战争，解放战争，表现了千万人忠勇而顽强的
  斗志。从此，中国共产党和徐水人民，建立了血肉般的关系。到如今，“苦战一冬春，全面大跃进”，红徐水！请允许我伸一大拇指。（二）红徐水！最难忘的一天，全民敬爱的毛主席亲身来
  到。三十多万人民感谢毛主席，
  大家想怎样答报？只有把赤心来接受党的领
  导，一时掀起人民公社的高潮。一乡一社，组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化，看！看！粉墙上写着徐水人民的歌
  谣：“走了半世独木桥，如今踏上阳关道”。（三）人民公社真好呀！红徐水！我们亲见了一个个高炉放出
  钢铁的火花；亲见了男女青年劳武合一
  化；亲见了深耕密植后农作物又
  高又大；亲见了很讲究卫生的牛、羊、猪、马；亲见了幼儿园里成群喜笑着
  的胖娃娃；亲见了幸福院里快活的男女
  老人家。他们互助着，相敬相爱着，红徐水！社会主义迈进一步了，这些不是共产主义精神，是
  什么？（四）红徐水！一切靠谁领导？是共产党。红徐水！是新中华的雏形。新中华全面大跃进，靠的是谁？是共产党。全世界和平将得到保障，靠的是谁？是共产党。红徐水！经过前后对比，他们天真地高唱：“过去信神饿断肠，如今靠党谷满仓”。
