    "Hecogenin" Successfully Trial-produced
    With the help of scientific institutions, our farm has successfully trial-produced "Hecogenin" extracted from sisal leaves. It has now been officially put into production.
    "Hecogenin" is the main raw material for synthesizing "Cortisone". "Cortisone" is a special medicine for treating rheumatism and arthritis. Patients paralyzed for several years can quickly regain their health by taking this medicine. At the same time, it has significant effects on the treatment of acute diseases and general internal medicine diseases.
    According to records, only the United Kingdom, the United States, and France can currently produce "Hecogenin," but they monopolize the international market, charge high prices, and refuse to sell it to our country. Recently, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, we have shown revolutionary vigor and dedication, and finally succeeded in trial production in just a few months.

    “海克吉宁”试制成功
    我场在科学机关的帮助下，从龙舌麻叶片中提取“海克吉宁”试制成功。目前已正式投入生产。
    “海克吉宁”是合成“可蒂霜”的主要原料，“可蒂霜”是治疗风湿症、关节炎的特效药，瘫痪数年服此药很快就可以恢复健康。同时，对治疗急性疾病和一般内科疾病都有显著的效果。
    据材料记载，目前能提制“海克吉宁”的国家只有英美法三国，但他们垄断国际市场，价格昂贵，并且不卖给我国。最近，我们在总路线的光辉照耀下，拿出了革命干劲和钻劲，终于在短短的几个月中试制成功。  （国营东方红农场）
