Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 12th: French authorities and fascist bandits are constantly provoking the French Communist Party.

On the 12th, the authorities confiscated the French Communist Party's newspaper "l'Humanité" because it published an article about De Gaulle's appointment of General Cabié as garrison commander of Paris. When Cabié was the supreme commander of French-ruled Madagascar in 1947, he brutally suppressed the uprising of the Malagasy people, massacring 90,000 Malagasy people.

Late at night on the 9th, several fascists attempted to attack the Ivry Communist Party branch. The party members were holding a meeting at the time, and they fought back. The police actually arrested several people who stopped the fascist provocations, but more than 1,000 Communist Party members and Republicans came to the location of the party branch, forcing the police to release those they had arrested.

On the same day, Roland Plaisance, a Communist Party member of the Eure provincial council, was attacked by a dozen fascists outside the Eure provincial committee of the French Communist Party in Évreux, who smashed Roland Plaisance's car.

In addition, on the morning of the 11th, when members of the General Confederation of Labour were distributing pamphlets against De Gaulle's "constitution" at the entrance of the Simca factory in Poissy, they were attacked by a group of fascists. The trade union members vigorously fought back against the fascist provocations.

    法西斯分子向法共挑衅
    法当局竟逮捕制止法西斯挑衅的人
    新华社巴黎12日电　法国当局和法西斯匪徒向法国共产党不断进行挑衅。
    12日当局没收了法国共产党机关报“人道报”，因为它刊载了一篇关于戴高乐任命加贝将军为巴黎卫戍司令的文章。加贝在1947年任法属马达加斯加的最高司令时，曾经对起义的马达加斯加人进行残酷的镇压，屠杀了九万名马达加斯加人。
    在9日深夜，好几名法西斯分子企图袭击伊符里的共产党支部。这时党员们正在开会，他们当时予以回击。警察竟然逮捕了几名制止法西斯挑衅的人，但是一千多名共产党员和共和人士纷纷来到党支部所在地迫使警察释放了他们所逮捕的人。
    在同一天，厄尔省共产党议员罗兰·普莱桑在埃夫勒法国共产党省委员会门外受到十来名法西斯分子的袭击，他们捣毁了罗兰·普莱桑的汽车。
    另外在11日上午，当法国总工会会员在布瓦西的西姆卡工厂门口散发关于反对戴高乐“宪法”的小册子时，受到一批法西斯分子的袭击，工会会员对法西斯分子的挑衅进行了有力的反击。
