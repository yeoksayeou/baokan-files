    The Whole Nation Engages in Transportation to Guarantee Steel Production
    Changzhou Mobilizes Thousands to Deliver "Supplies" to Construction Sites and Furnaces

    (Our Nanjing dispatch, September 11) With the unwavering determination of "ants moving Mount Tai," Changzhou has mobilized over 40,000 people throughout the city to form a transportation army, paving the way for the two marshals, steel and machinery. Since late August, the city has relied on this army to transport 1,500 tons of steel raw materials daily to construction sites and furnaces, ensuring "immediate availability and delivery upon request."

    Changzhou's experience in mobilizing the entire population to engage in transportation has garnered attention from the Ministry of Railways and the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee. A field meeting was recently convened to promote this approach across the country.

    As early as the end of June this year, the Changzhou Municipal Party Committee discovered a sharp contradiction: due to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the city's freight transport volume had surged, while transportation capacity lagged far behind. The Municipal Party Committee resolved to implement the policy of the whole Party and the entire population engaging in transportation, to quickly resolve this contradiction. First, a large-scale debate was organized among the masses to discuss questions such as "Do we need steel? How will the raw materials for steelmaking and ironmaking reach the factories? What to do about the backlog of goods at the railway station?" After the debate, cadres from city organs, officers and soldiers from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Changzhou, workers, students, street residents, industrialists, business people, religious figures, and people from all walks of life eagerly signed up to join the transportation team. In three days, 40,000 people signed up, establishing seven "Socialist Construction Support Brigades." The masses in each district also established their own resident transportation teams, resident volunteer transportation teams, social welfare transportation stations, worker family transportation cooperatives, industrial and mining transportation teams, and other diverse transportation organizations. This brand-new transportation force first launched the first battle to eliminate congestion in the railway station freight yard.

    On the morning of July 2nd, led by the Municipal Party Secretary and Mayor, armies from all directions, holding high red flags, beating war drums, carrying rakes, shoulder poles, and pushing carts, rushed to the railway station freight yard. Due to a shortage of transportation tools, some used soap boxes, egg baskets, rice washing baskets, flour sacks, and all kinds of carrying poles, lifting, carrying, and shouldering the loads. Cadre brigades and resident brigades were responsible for loading and unloading trucks, rushing to transport ore; industrial and commercial brigades and student brigades were responsible for loading and unloading wooden boats, rushing to transport coal; professional flatbed truck teams rushed to transport heavy items, delivering them to various unloading units; and unloading units also organized armies to rush to unload. The city's twenty theatrical troupes also participated in transportation in rotation, giving comfort performances along the way. It was truly a grand scene with thousands of troops and horses, with a continuous stream of transport personnel until late at night. After five days and nights of battle, 20,000 tons of materials were finally cleared, relieving the tension at the station and ensuring the needs of factories and construction units.

    In mid-July, small blast furnaces sprang up all over the city like mushrooms after rain, and large amounts of coal were stockpiled at the railway station, requiring rapid transportation for coking. This transportation brigade then launched the second battle. After four days of fighting, 4,000 tons of coking coal were transported to the iron smelting site in a timely manner after three transfers, ensuring the production of large and small blast furnaces.

    Currently, steel production in the city has entered a new high tide, requiring a large number of raw materials. The city's daily transport volume of steel raw materials alone has increased by 1,500 tons. In September, 200,000 tons of ore, coal, and refractory materials are needed. Therefore, in addition to undertaking intra-city transportation tasks, this transportation brigade has also organized long-distance transportation teams to transport iron ore from Fenghuang Mountain in Jiangning. Recently, a second expedition team of 1,500 people rushed to Niutou Mountain in Zhenjiang to transport iron ore.

    In order to rapidly increase transportation capacity, while organizing the masses to engage in large-scale transportation, Changzhou also mobilized the masses to engage in large-scale transportation equipment construction and transportation tool reform. The city mobilized more than 3,500 people and spent only 28 days to build a new 3,025-meter freight line and a 250-mu freight yard. In addition, two bridges and 4,253 meters of highways were built. In terms of transportation tool reform, the wisdom of the masses was also fully utilized. Workers across the city put forward 23,000 rationalization proposals and successfully trial-produced 29 kinds of tools, greatly improving work efficiency. Within a month, heavy manual labor such as shoulder carrying and human lifting was eliminated.

### 全民搞运输　保证出钢铁  常州市千军万马把“粮草”送到工地送到炉边

    全民搞运输　保证出钢铁
    常州市千军万马把“粮草”送到工地送到炉边
    本报南京11日电　常州市以“蚂蚁搬泰山”的坚毅决心，发动全市四万多人组成运输大军，为钢铁和机械两个元帅开路。8月下旬以后，全市每天运量达一千五百吨的钢铁原材料，都依靠这支大军及时运送到工地和炉边，做到了“随要随有随送到”。
    常州市发动全民办交通的经验已受到铁道部和江苏省委的重视，并且在最近召开了现场会议，要在全国各地推广。
    中共常州市委早在今年6月底就发现：由于工农业生产的大跃进，全市货物运输量激增，而运输能力却远远跟不上，这个矛盾显得很尖锐。市委决心贯彻全党全民办交通的方针，迅速解决这个矛盾。首先在群众中组织了一次大辩论，讨论“要不要钢铁？炼钢炼铁的原材料怎样到达工厂？火车站的积压物资搬不走怎么办？”等问题。经过辩论以后，全市机关干部、中国人民解放军驻常州部队的官兵、工人、学生、街道居民、工商界、宗教界等各界人民，都争先恐后地报名参加运输队。三天功夫，就有四万人报名参加，共建立了七个“社会主义建设支援大队”；各区群众自己还建立了居民运输队，居民义务运输队、社会福利运输站、工人家属运输合作社、工矿运输队等各种各样的运输组织。这支崭新的运输队伍，首先投入了消灭火车站货场堵塞的第一个战役。
    7月2日清晨，由市委书记、市长率领，各路大军高举红旗，敲起战鼓，扛着钉耙，挑着箩担，推着小车，从四面八方奔向火车站货场。运输工具不足，有人就用肥皂箱、鸡蛋篓、淘米箩、面粉袋和各种各样的杠棒，抬的抬，挑的挑，背的背。干部大队和居民大队负责汽车装卸，抢运矿石；工商界大队和学生大队负责木船装卸，抢运煤炭；专业板车队抢运重件，送到各卸货单位；各卸货单位也组织抢卸大军。全市二十个剧团也轮流参加运输，沿途还作慰问演出，真是千军万马，声势浩大，直到深夜，运输人群还络绎不绝。经过五昼夜的战斗，终于出清了二万吨物资，解除了车站的紧张局面，保证了工厂和基建单位的需要。
    7月中旬，全市小高炉像雨后春笋般地出现，大量煤炭堆存火车站，需要迅速运去炼焦。这支运输大队又投入了第二个战役。战斗四天，四千吨焦煤经过三次中转，及时运到了炼铁场地，保证了大小高炉的生产。
    目前，全市钢铁生产又卷入了新的高潮，需要大量的原材料，全市单钢铁原材料的运量每天就增加了一千五百吨；9月份所需的矿石、煤炭和耐火材料就需要二十万吨，因此，这支运输大队除了担负市内运输任务以外，又组织了远征运输队前往江宁凤凰山搬运铁矿石。最近，又有第二批一千五百人组织的远征队，赶往镇江牛头山运铁矿石。
    为了迅速增加运输能力，在组织群众大搞运输的同时，常州还发动群众大搞运输设备，改造运输工具。全市发动了三千五百多人，仅仅花了二十八天的时间，新建成了一条三千零二十五公尺的货运线和占地二百五十亩的货场。此外，还造了两座桥和四千二百五十三公尺的公路。在运输工具的改革方面，也充分发挥了群众的智慧。全市工人提出了二万三千条合理化建议，试制成功二十九种工具，大大提高了工效，一个月内，就消灭了肩挑人抬的笨重体力劳动。
