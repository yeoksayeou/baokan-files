    Jinzhou Railway Bureau Takes Revolutionary Measures
    Reduce Stops, Increase Speed, Seize Loading and Unloading

    Ministry of Railways Calls on Railway Employees Nationwide to Learn from Jinzhou Experience

    This newspaper's Jinzhou dispatch on the 17th (Reporters Jin Yuanqing and Wang Dianxue): The Jinzhou Railway Bureau has adopted revolutionary measures, internally reforming transportation organization to allow freight cars to stop less and run faster, shortening transfer times. Externally, it relies on the strong support of all the people to seize loading and unloading opportunities, shortening loading and unloading times, and establishing a red flag for accelerating freight car turnaround and improving transportation efficiency.
    In the first half of September, this bureau shortened the freight car turnaround time from 1.15 days in the first half of the year to 1.01 days, saving the state 972 freight cars per day, which can be used to transport more than 28,000 tons of goods.
    The experience created by the Jinzhou Railway Bureau has attracted the attention of the Ministry of Railways. At the national railway telephone conference held by the Ministry of Railways on the 16th, Minister Teng Daiyuan called on the railway workers and the transportation department workers of factories and mines participating in the conference nationwide to learn from and promote the experience of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau. If this bureau's experience is promoted on railways nationwide, it can greatly increase the freight capacity of the national railway.
    The Jinzhou Railway Bureau's more than 1,800 kilometers of railways is a vital transportation artery connecting Shanhaiguan and beyond. Recently, in order to support the rise of the steel marshal nationwide, thousands of freight cars are needed every day to transport large amounts of metallurgical equipment, steel materials, coking coal and other important materials from the Northeast industrial base to various parts of the country. As a result, the volume of freight transport has suddenly increased, creating a tense situation of more goods than cars. The number of vehicles needed by the Jinzhou Railway Bureau in September this year has increased by nearly double compared to January. After investigation and analysis, the bureau found that 65% of the time in the freight car turnaround process is spent staying at the station. If the stay time of freight cars at the station is reduced, the vehicle turnaround can be accelerated, and more goods can be transported with the existing vehicles. Since the end of August, the bureau has put forward the slogan of "every second counts" to demand vehicles from time, fully mobilizing the masses to seize loading, unloading, and time, shortening the turnaround time of vehicles, and saving a large number of vehicles for the state.
    The shortage of goods and vehicles is the main contradiction in the current railway transportation. Starting from the leading idea of ​​the whole people running the railway, the Jinzhou Railway Bureau has created three important experiences to solve this contradiction. After the Luotuo Ying Station and the Taiji Coal Washing Plant of Beipiao Mining Bureau implemented unified thinking, unified dispatch, unified shifts, unified planning, unified indicators, unified technical inspection, and joint responsibility to complete the task of communist cooperation, they took the initiative to reduce the procedures for distributing vehicles from twelve to six, cancel the method of phased distribution of vehicles between railways and mines, cancel fines, and allow locomotives of railways and mines to support each other back and forth, so that they can be sent and taken as needed. Therefore, the loading and unloading time of Luotuo Ying Station was shortened from 9.48 minutes in the first half of the year to 5.24 minutes, saving 26 freight cars in one day.
    The experience created by Goubangzi Station is: relying on the support of local authorities, residents, and garrison troops, organizing family loading and unloading teams, employee amateur loading and unloading teams, and employee loading and unloading teams of government agencies and enterprises, concentrating loading and unloading forces, so that people waiting for cars for loading and unloading, instead of cars waiting for people for loading and unloading, using the gap time of locomotives adding water and reversing, to carry out seize loading and unloading, and without affecting the punctual operation of trains, shortening the loading and unloading time from 11.36 minutes in the first half of the year to 1.24 minutes.
    The experience of Dahu Mountain Station in shortening the freight car transfer time from 96 minutes to 66 minutes is: reforming the railway transportation organization work, strengthening the cooperation of internal units, changing the past staged operations, adopting parallel operations, streamlining many repeated operations, and erecting the red flag of freight car transfer time.
    After the experience of shortening the transfer and loading and unloading time of freight cars created by Luotuo Ying, Goubangzi, and Dahu Mountain stations was promoted in the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, the transfer and stay time of freight cars was greatly shortened. In the first half of September, the loading and unloading time of freight cars in the bureau averaged from 9.48 minutes in the first half of the year to 6.30 minutes; the transfer time of freight cars averaged from 2.54 minutes in the first half of the year to 2.06 minutes; the freight car turnover rate was shortened from 1.15 days in the first half of the year to 1.01 days, creating the highest record in the national railway system.

    依靠全党全民力量　动员一切交通工具
    为钢铁开路
    锦州铁路管理局采取革命性措施
    少停快跑抢装抢卸
    铁道部号召全国铁路员工学习锦州经验
    本报锦州17日电　记者金原青、王殿学报道：锦州铁路管理局采取革命性措施，在内部改革运输组织工作，让货车少停快跑，缩短中转时间；在外部依靠全民大力支援，抢装抢卸抢时间，缩短装卸时间，竖起加速货车周转，提高运输效率的红旗。
    这个管理局在9月上半月，把货车的周转时间，从上半年达到的一点一五天，缩短到一点零一天，每天给国家节省了九百七十二辆货车，能用来多运送二万八千多吨货物。
    锦州铁路管理局创造的这个经验，已经引起铁道部的重视。在铁道部16日召开的全国铁路电话会议上，滕代远部长号召参加会议的全国铁路职工、厂矿的运输部门职工，学习推广锦州铁路管理局的经验。这个管理局的经验如果在全国铁路上推广，就可以大大增加全国铁路的货运能力。
    锦州铁路管理局管内的一千八百多公里铁路，是联接山海关内外的交通要道。最近期间，为支援全国钢铁元帅升帐，每天都需要几千辆货车，把大量的冶金设备、钢铁材料、炼焦煤等等重要物资，从东北工业基地，源源不断运往关内各地。因此，货物运输量突然增加，出现了货多车少的紧张局面。锦州铁路管理局今年9月份需要车辆的数量，比1月份增加将近一倍。这个管理局经过调查分析，摸清了货车在周转过程中，有65％的时间，是在车站上停留，如果压缩货车在车站的停留时间，就能加快车辆周转，用现有的车运送更多的货物。从8月下旬开始，这个管理局提出了分秒必争，向时间要车的口号，充分发动群众，抢装、抢卸、抢时间，缩短了车辆的周转时间，为国家节省出大批车辆。
    货多车少是当前铁路运输的主要矛盾，锦州铁路管理局从全民办铁路的主导思想出发，创造出解决这个矛盾的三个重要经验。骆驼营车站和北票矿务局台吉选煤厂，实行统一思想、统一调度、统一班次、统一计划、统一指标、统一技术检查，共同负责，完成运输任务的共产主义大协作之后，主动地把配送车辆的手续，从十二道减少到六道，取消铁路、矿山之间分阶段配送车辆的办法，取消罚款，让铁路、矿山的机车，互相往来支援，做到随用随送，随装随取。因此，骆驼营车站的装卸时间，从上半年的九点四十八分钟缩短到五点二十四分钟，一天就节省了二十六辆货车。
    沟帮子车站创造的经验是：依靠地方机关、居民、驻军的支援，组织了家属装卸队、职工业余装卸队、机关企业职工装卸队，集中了装卸力量，做到装卸车的人等车，不要车等人装卸，利用机车上水和倒车等的空隙时间，实行抢装抢卸，在不影响列车正点运行的情况下，把装、卸车的时间，从上半年的十一点三十六分钟，缩短到一点二十四分钟。
    大虎山车站把货车中转时间，从九十六分钟缩短到六十六分钟的经验是：改革铁路运输组织工作，加强内部各单位的协作，改变过去分阶段作业，采用平行作业，精简许多重复作业，竖立起货车中转时间的红旗。
    骆驼营、沟帮子、大虎山三个车站创造的缩短货车中转、装卸时间的经验，在锦州铁路管理局全局推广后，货车中转、停留时间大大缩短。全局在9月上半月，货车的装卸时间，平均由上半年的九点四十八分钟缩短到六点三十分钟；货车的中转时间，平均从上半年的两点五十四分钟缩短到两点零六分钟；货车周转率，从上半年的一点十五天，缩短到一点零一天，创造全国铁路系统的最高纪录。
