　　Shandong Province's Counties and Cities People's Courts
　　Mobilizing the Masses for Debate in Case Trials
　　Ensures Quality, Conducts Legal Education, and Promotes Production Movements
　　(Our reporter Zhu Rimei reports) People's Courts in counties and cities of Shandong Province are widely adopting the method of mass debate to handle civil and criminal cases, with good results. According to preliminary statistics from eight counties including Huangxian, Zhaoyuan, Rongcheng, Laiyang, Jiaoxian, Changle, Dexian, and Juye, from March to June, this method was used to handle 515 civil and criminal cases. The results of these cases show that this method not only improves efficiency and ensures quality but also provides vivid legal education to the masses, playing a positive role in preventing crime and disputes.

　　The general approach of the People's Courts in counties and cities in handling civil and criminal cases using this method is as follows: select cases suitable for debate, take the case files down to the villages, rely on the leadership of the local Party committees, and further clarify the situation through local cadres, activists, and relevant personnel, unify understanding, and jointly study and determine the focus and method of the debate. For cases that are complex, involve a wide range of people, and have significant social educational value, large-scale debates are generally adopted.

　　When the masses participate in the debate on a case, whether they are plaintiffs, defendants, witnesses, or informants, the information they provide is relatively truthful and much broader and more comprehensive than the material obtained by judicial personnel working alone. Therefore, it can greatly improve efficiency and ensure quality. Many long-delayed cases are resolved within two or three days after mass debate. The case of Tian Wancai, a resident of the Central District of Jinan City, whose house accidentally caught fire on the evening of September 22, 1957, burning 34 pieces of clothing processed by the neighboring laundry shop, is illustrative. The manager of the laundry shop sued the Central District People's Court, demanding compensation for the loss. The court accepted the case but had not resolved it for nearly half a year. Recently, they convened a meeting on-site with the plaintiff, the defendant, and the owners of the burned clothes. At the meeting, everyone criticized Tian Wancai for his lack of a sense of responsibility, and at the same time unanimously agreed that Tian Wancai's inability to pay compensation was also a practical reality. After obtaining everyone's understanding, they unanimously expressed that they would not ask Tian Wancai to compensate for the loss, and the cloth ticket issue for the owners of the burned clothes would be subsidized by the textile wholesale station. In this way, a case that had been delayed for half a year was resolved in less than two days.

　　For mass disputes between villages or between cooperatives, local areas adopt the method of separate debates and joint consultations to handle them. The Jiaoxian People's Court used this method to handle a case involving a tree dispute between Wang Zhenkui and Xia Futian, which not only quickly resolved the dispute but also provided legal education to the masses, playing a role in preventing crime. Wang KuiZhen and Xia Futian were in two different agricultural cooperatives. Wang Zhenkui was found by Xia Futian cutting down trees, Xia Futian took the trees and gave them to the agricultural cooperative where Xia was, which caused dissatisfaction among some cadres and members of the two cooperatives. After repeated unsuccessful mediation by the township, Wang Zhenkui sued to the court, and it had not been resolved for more than a year. Recently, the Jiaoxian People's Court repeatedly studied this case. The judicial personnel took the case files down to the village, conducted socialist education on the cadres of the two agricultural cooperatives in conjunction with the township Party committee, and convened separate debate meetings under the auspices of the township Party committee. During the debate in the agricultural cooperative where Wang Zhenkui was, everyone criticized Wang Zhenkui's behavior of cutting down trees privately, pointing out that cutting down trees was detrimental both to the public and to himself, and would cause the river to break through the dam and endanger production. At the debate in the agricultural cooperative where Xia Futian was, the masses pointed out that Xia Futian's action of not stopping the tree cutting when he saw it, but waiting until it was finished before detaining it, did not meet the requirements of forest protection. After everyone analyzed it in this way, both sides examined their mistakes and jointly studied and came up with a solution.

　　The Rizhuang People's Tribunal of Laiyang County, through the handling of the case of cutting down trees in the Zhaizhuang Agricultural Cooperative of Ligezhuang Township, not only provided legal education to the masses but also powerfully stimulated the production enthusiasm of the masses. In this cooperative, since 1957, under the instigation of the local bad element Zhou Jianren, cutting down trees had become a common practice, seriously affecting the enthusiasm of the members for afforestation. The Ligezhuang Township Party Committee and the Rizhuang People's Tribunal believed that this was a widespread problem that must be debated by the masses in order to isolate the principal culprits and effectively stop the act of cutting down trees. Therefore, they convened a debate meeting of more than 500 people with the participation of representatives from nearby agricultural cooperatives. After the debate, the crimes of the principal culprits Zhou Jianren and others were all exposed and severely condemned by the masses. In addition, 68 households that had cut down trees also elected representatives to make self-criticisms at the meeting, expressing their willingness to hand over all existing trees and draw up tree planting and tree protection plans. The next day, they returned 318 trees, and more than 30 people wrote guarantees to ensure that 800 trees would be planted and survive. The attendance rate for labor in the whole cooperative increased from 50% to 100%.

　　Experience in various places has proved that, in addition to handling civil cases, criminal cases can also directly mobilize the masses to expose crimes, thereby obtaining more materials and evidence. The Weifang City People's Court, through the handling of the case of counter-revolutionaries Yu Jinmei and Yu Huaiqing, also encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses and changed the backward appearance of Xiaohuayuan Village, where these two people lived. Yu Jinmei and Yu Huaiqing were originally "two landlords" in Xiaohuayuan Village. After liberation, they threatened and roped in cadres, and often spread rumors and sabotage among the masses. These two criminals refused to confess their crimes during the pre-trial, but later the masses participated in the debate on this case, exposing many powerful facts, forcing the two criminals to bow their heads and confess their crimes in the face of ironclad facts. This debate educated the masses, and the production enthusiasm of the masses was generally improved, and the labor attendance rate reached 100%, transforming the village from a backward village to an advanced village. Township head Yu Haiguang said with satisfaction: "If the trial had only been held in the court, although these two pests could have been eliminated, it would not have had such a great effect. This method is too good."

　　山东省各县市人民法院
　　发动群众辩论审理案件
    保证了办案质量　进行了法制教育　推动了生产运动
    本报讯　记者朱日梅报道：山东省各县、市人民法院普遍采取群众辩论的方法处理民事和刑事案件，收到了良好效果。据黄县、招远、荣成、莱阳、胶县、昌乐、德县、巨野八个县的初步统计，从3月到6月，采取这种方法处理了五百一十五起民事和刑事案件。从这些案件的处理结果来看，采取这种方法不但可以提高办案效率，保证办案质量，并通过对案件的处理向广大群众进行了生动的法制教育，对预防犯罪、预防纠纷起了积极的作用。
    各县、市人民法院用这种方法处理民事和刑事案件的作法，一般是：选择适宜辩论的案件携卷下乡，依靠当地党委的领导，通过当地干部、积极分子和有关人员进一步摸清情况，统一认识，共同研究确定辩论重点和辩论的方式。对案情复杂、牵扯面较广、社会教育意义较大的案件，一般都采取大型辩论的方式。
    群众参加对案件的辩论，不论原告、被告、证人和检举人，所谈的情况都比较真实，比审判人员单人独马所获得的材料要广泛得多，全面得多，因而可以大大提高办案效率，保证办案质量。有许多积压很久的案件，一经群众辩论，在两、三天内就解决了。济南市中区居民田万才家在1957年9月22日晚不慎失火，连烧了隔壁洗衣局加工的衣服三十四件，洗衣局经理到中区人民法院控告，要求赔偿损失，法院收案后近半年未结案。最近他们就地召开了原告、被告及被烧衣服的顾主会议，会上，大家对田万才的责任心不强进行了批评，同时一致认为田万才无力赔偿也是实际情况。在取得大家谅解后，一致表示不要田万才赔偿损失，被烧衣服的顾主的布票问题，由纺织品批发站予以补助。这样一来，积压半年的案件不到两天就解决了。
    对村与村之间、社与社之间的群众纠纷，各地采取分别辩论、共同协商的方法来处理。胶县人民法院用这个办法处理王振奎和夏福田闹树木纠纷一案，不但很快解决了纠纷，而且向广大群众进行了法制教育，起到了预防犯罪的作用。王奎振和夏福田分别在两个农业社。王振奎砍伐树木被夏福田发现，夏福田把树木扣留并交给夏所在的农业社使用了，因此引起了两社部分干部和社员的不满。经乡屡次调解无效，王振奎告到法院，一年多未得到解决。最近胶县人民法院反复研究了这个案件，审判人员携卷下乡，会同乡党委对两个农业社的干部进行了社会主义教育，并在乡党委的主持下，分别召开了辩论会。王振奎所在农业社在辩论时，大家批判了王振奎私自伐树的行为，指出伐树于公于私都不利，会使河水冲破坝地，危害生产。在夏福田所在农业社的辩论会上，群众指出，夏福田看到伐树不制止，等到伐完再扣留的作法是不符合护林的要求的。经过大家这样分析，双方各自检讨了错误以后，就共同研究出了处理的意见。
    莱阳县日庄人民法庭通过对李格庄乡寨庄农业社砍伐树木一案的处理，向群众进行了法制教育以后，还有力地激发了群众的生产积极性。这个社从1957年起，在当地坏分子周建人的煽动下，砍伐树木已经成风，严重地影响了社员造林的积极性。李格庄乡党委和日庄人民法庭认为这是一个带有普遍性的问题，必须发动群众进行辩论，才能孤立首要分子，有效地制止砍伐树木的行为。于是他们便召开了有附近农业社代表参加的五百多人的辩论会。经过辩论，首要分子周建人等三人的罪行全部被揭发出来，并受到群众的严厉谴责。另外，有六十八户有砍伐树木行为的人也推选代表在会上作了检讨，表示愿意把现存树木全部交出，并订立了栽树和保树计划。他们在第二天就送回树木三百一十八棵，有三十多人写了保证书保证栽活八百棵树。全社劳动出勤率由50％提高到100％。
    各地的经验证明，除过处理民事案件以外，处理刑事案件也可以直接发动群众，揭发犯罪，从而获得更多的材料和证据。潍坊市人民法院通过对反革命分子于金美、于怀庆一案的处理，还鼓舞了群众的生产积极性，改变了这两个人所在的小花园村的落后面貌。于金美、于怀庆两人原来是小花园村的“二地主”，解放后威胁拉拢干部，经常在群众中造谣破坏。这两个犯人在预审中拒不认罪，后来群众参加了对这一案件的辩论，揭发了许多有力的事实，使这两个犯人在铁的事实面前只得低头认罪。通过这场辩论教育了群众，群众的生产积极性普遍提高，劳动出勤率达到了100％，由落后村一跃而为先进村。乡长于海光满意地说：“如果只在法院审判，虽然也可以除掉这两害，但决不会起这么大作用，这种办法太好了。”
