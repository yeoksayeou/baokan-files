Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 6th. Reporter Hu Mingjun reports: The seamen of the "Yangtze Youth" vessel have achieved an astonishing success by pioneering night navigation on the perilous Three Gorges section of the Yangtze River, spanning hundreds of kilometers. At 9:00 AM on August 31st, the "Yangtze Youth" convoy, pushing three barges and carrying over 2,000 tons of cargo, departed from Chongqing. At 8:45 PM that same day, it arrived at Wanxian, from where it began its night voyage. Passing through the world-renowned Qutang Gorge and Wu Gorge, it navigated two hundred and thirty-six kilometers overnight, reaching Hejiawan in the Xiling Gorge at dawn on September 1st, and arriving in Yichang at 8:45 AM on the first day. From then on, Li Bai's poetic imagination of "Departing from Baidi amidst the colorful clouds of dawn, returning to Jiangling in a thousand miles in a single day" has become a reality.

The convoy arrived at its destination, Hankou, on the afternoon of the 2nd.

The "Yangtze Youth" convoy is massive, being thirty meters wide and approximately one hundred meters long. When the convoy passed through the Three Gorges at night, it relied solely on the red and white navigation markers on both banks and the dim moonlight to navigate through the dangerous shoals and turbulent waters, making it exceptionally perilous and difficult. Captain Duan Shurong, with over ten years of navigation experience on the Sichuan River, personally piloted and commanded the ship. The entire crew cooperated closely, overcoming dangerous shoals such as the Bayang Gorge, Shiban Gorge, Heishi Shoal, Pai Tuo, Flame Stone, and Niukou, finally passing safely through the Three Gorges.

The upstream night navigation from Chongqing to Yichang had already been successfully implemented by the end of 1955. Due to the swift currents of the Sichuan River, especially the many bends, narrow channels, and dangerous shoals in the Three Gorges section, downstream navigation is much more difficult than upstream navigation. Therefore, downstream night navigation had not been opened. In March of this year, the sailors resolved to break with convention and strive for excellence, and successfully trialed downstream night navigation on the Chongqing to Wanxian section. However, it was still not possible to trial night navigation in the Three Gorges section, which is far more difficult than the Chongqing to Wanxian section. The seamen of the "Yangtze Youth" vessel realized the ideal of full downstream night navigation on the Sichuan River with the heroic spirit of overcoming all difficulties.

Before the implementation of downstream night navigation on the Chongqing to Wanxian and Wanxian to Yichang sections, downstream ships from Chongqing to Yichang required two days of navigation. After the successful full downstream night navigation of the "Yangtze Youth" vessel, it only takes one day and one night to reach Yichang, and two days to reach Hankou. This greatly shortens the voyage time and accelerates the turnaround of ships.

    三峡夜航
    新华社重庆6日电　记者胡明俊报道：长江青年号轮的海员们在几百公里三峡天险地段首次创造了下水夜航成功的惊人成绩。8月31日上午9点，顶推三个驳船、载重两千多吨的长江青年号船队由重庆出发，当天下午8点45分到达万县，随即由万县开始夜航，经过世界闻名的瞿塘峡、巫峡，一夜航行二百三十六公里，在9月1日拂晓到达西陵峡的河家湾，一日早上8点45分到达宜昌。从此，李白诗句“朝辞白帝彩云间，千里江陵一日还”的想像已经变成了现实。
    这个船队2日下午已到达目的地汉口。
    长江青年号船队庞大，宽三十公尺、长约一百公尺。船队夜过三峡时，只凭借两岸红白色的航标和朦胧的月光，穿过险滩恶水迂回行进，异常艰险困难。有十多年川江航行经验的船长段树荣亲自领航指挥，全船海员通力合作，先后战胜了巴阳峡、石板峡、黑石滩、牌沱、火焰石、牛口等险滩，终于安全通过三峡。
    重庆到宜昌段的上水夜航，早在1955年底已经成功。由于川江水流湍急，特别是三峡地段弯多河窄，险滩很多，下水航行比上水困难得多，因此下水夜航一直没有开放。今年3月间，海员们决心破常规、争上游，试行重庆到万县段的下水夜航已经成功；但是还不能在比重庆、万县段困难得多的三峡地段试行夜航。长江青年号轮的海员们以排除万难的英雄气概，实现了川江下水全程夜航的理想。
    重庆到万县和万县到宜昌段未实行下水夜航以前，重庆到宜昌的下水轮船要航行两天时间；长江青年号轮下水全程夜航成功以后，只要一天一夜便到达宜昌，两天便到达汉口。这样就大大缩短了船期，加速了轮舶周转。
