    Birth of Internal Combustion Electric Locomotive

    China's first internal combustion electric locomotive, marking a new stage in China's locomotive manufacturing industry, was born on September 9th at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory.

    On the morning of the 13th, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held at the factory. This internal combustion electric locomotive pulled two carriages of guests and traveled back and forth between Changxindian and Liulihe on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, with very good performance. Representatives from the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Ministry of Railways, the Railway Science Research Institute, and related cooperative factories and schools all came to the factory to congratulate.

    This 600-horsepower internal combustion electric locomotive was successfully trial-produced by the workers after 88 days of hard work. The locomotive has a novel and beautiful design with a streamlined body. The carriages are equipped with hot and cold air devices and modern equipment, and all operations are electrified. The driver sits in a spacious and bright cab and can start the locomotive by pressing a button. The locomotive weighs 60 tons, the maximum engine power is 680 kilowatts, and the maximum speed per hour is 85 kilometers.

    All of the more than 30,000 parts for this internal combustion electric locomotive were manufactured in China. It is more durable, economical, and efficient than steam locomotives, and it uses diesel engines, saving coal and water.

    Simultaneously with the successful trial production of the internal combustion electric locomotive, a 600-horsepower internal combustion engine was also successfully trial-produced by this factory.

    内燃电动机车诞生
    标志我国机车制造工业新阶段的我国第一台内燃电动机车，9月9日在长辛店机车车辆修理工厂诞生了。
    13日上午，工厂里举行了剪彩仪式，这台内燃电动机车牵引着两节车厢的宾客，在京广干线的长辛店到琉璃河间行驶了一个来回，效能很好。中共北京市委、铁道部、铁道科学研究院和有关协作工厂、学校的代表，都到厂祝贺。
    这台六百马力的内燃电动机车，是经过职工们苦战八十八天试制成功的。机车的式样新颖美观，车身是流线型的。车厢内装有冷热风装置和现代化设备，全部操作都是电气化。司机坐在宽敞明亮的驾驶室内，按电钮就可以开车。机车自重六十吨，发动机最大功率是六百八十瓩，每小时最高车速为八十五公里。
    这台内燃电动机车的三万多件配件全部是我国制造的，它比蒸汽机车耐用、经济、效率高，用柴油机发动，省煤省水。
    与内燃电动机车试制成功的同时，一部六百马力的内燃机也由这个工厂试制成功了。
