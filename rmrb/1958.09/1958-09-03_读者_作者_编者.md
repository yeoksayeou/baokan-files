　　The People's Commune Attracts Us
　　The People's Daily's several reports on the People's Commune strongly attracted us. After returning from the classroom and driving range, comrades scrambled to read them, and also automatically discussed the ten advantages and four favorable conditions summarized by the Xinyang Special District, and talked about the rural outlook of the leap towards communism, which greatly inspired them.

　　Reality Higher Than Ancient People's Imagination
　　After reading the news about the Jianhua Machinery Factory implementing the "Eight No's" system published in the Industrial Edition on August 20th and Comrade Chen Zhiyan's short article "What Does the Land of Gentlemen Amount To?", I felt very excited. Because this news powerfully demonstrated the changes in people's mental outlook after the rectification campaign, and demonstrated the growth of communist morality. Comrade Chen Zhiyan's short article was also well written. He praised the reality higher than ancient people's imagination, and also pointed out the great significance of this new atmosphere.

　　Report How Transferred Cadres Become Red and Expert
　　Recently, the People's Daily has reported relatively little about transferred cadres. What have transferred cadres gained in labor training? How do they become red in the countryside and expert in the countryside? I hope to publish more reports and articles in this regard in the future.

　　Prescribing the Right Medicine
　　Lin Wei's "Pressure and Awareness" on the second page of August 14th is a very good article. This article combined theory with practice, explaining the principles very thoroughly, and eloquently explained that: "Exercise will produce pressure. But this is not a bad thing, but a good thing." This article is indeed prescribing the right medicine to solve the ideological problems of some people at present.
    I think that articles like this should be placed in the "Ideological Commentary" column.

　　A Flaw in a Headline
　　Seeing the headline on the front page of August 13th, "Macheng Jianguo First Commune Appears 'Number One Field Under Heaven'", I felt it was not appropriate.
    Of course, it is a gratifying thing that Macheng has achieved a high-yield field with a yield of more than 36,900 catties per mu, but calling it "Number One Field Under Heaven" is not right. Later, there were yields of 43,000 catties per mu, and even yields of more than 50,000 catties per mu. In the future, such headlines should not only encourage the collectives and individuals who create records to feel that they must continue to move forward, but also inspire others to "catch up with the advanced." I think the flaw in this title is looking at things that are leaping forward at a rapid pace with a "static" point of view.

　　New Maxims in the Great Leap Forward
　　After reading the "Sparks of Thought" column in the supplement on August 22nd, I felt it was very good. Like "Potential is Like a Well", comparing the revolutionary enthusiasm and work potential of the people under the leadership of the Party to "a well", the deeper the well is dug, the more spring water there will be, which is truly profound. "Buttons and Buttonholes" wrote that after the rectification campaign, leading cadres participated in actual production, which closely linked them with the workers. The workers described this new type of relationship as "the branch secretary, the factory director, and us are like buttons and buttonholes, and can no longer be separated." How accurate, vivid, and touching it is!
    These "Sparks of Thought" are concise in language and profound in meaning, novel in form, and unique. They can be said to be new-style maxims in the socialist Great Leap Forward, giving people light, heat, and strength. We need it!

　　人民公社吸引着我们
    人民日报关于人民公社的几篇报道，强烈地吸引了我们。同志们从课堂、从驾驶场归来后，都抢着读，还自动讨论起信阳专区总结出的十大优点和四项有利条件，畅谈着向共产主义跃进的农村面貌，精神上受到很大的鼓舞。

    高于古人幻想的现实
    我读了8月20日工业版刊登的建华机械厂实行“八无”制度的消息和陈之衍同志的短文“君子国又算得了什么”以后，感到非常兴奋。因为这条消息有力地表现了整风之后人们精神面貌的变化，表现了共产主义道德的成长。陈之衍同志的短文也写得好，他歌颂了高于古人幻想的现实，还指出了这种新气象的伟大意义。

    报道下放干部怎样红专
    近来人民日报对下放干部的报道比较少。下放干部在劳动锻炼中有些什么收获？怎样红在农村、专在农村？希望今后多登载这方面的报道和文章。
      安东市红旗农业社　李棋木
    对症下药
    8月14日第二版上林韦同志写的“压力和自觉”是一篇很好的文章。这篇文章结合实际，把道理阐发得很透辟，雄辩地说明了：“运动会产生压力。但这不是坏事，而是好事。”这篇文章，对解决当前一些人的思想问题，的确是对症下药。
    我以为，像这样的文章应该放在“思想评论”专栏里。
         南阳一中教师　孙涤华
    一个标题的缺点
    看到8月13日一版头条标题“麻城建国一社出现天下第一田”，感到不太合适。
    麻城出现亩产三万六千九百多斤的高额丰产田，当然是一件可喜的事，但称之为“天下第一田”，就不对了。后来又出现了亩产四万三千斤的，还有亩产五万斤以上的。今后这类标题，最好既能鼓励创造纪录的集体和个人感到必须继续前进，又能启发别人去“赶先进”。我认为这个标题的缺点是以“不变”的观点看一日千里飞跃前进的事物。

    大跃进中的新格言
    读了8月22日副刊上“思想的火花”一栏后，觉得非常好。像其中的“潜力好比一口井”，把人民群众在党的领导下的革命干劲、工作的潜力比作“一口井”，井，越挖深，泉水也就越多，说得真深刻。“钮扣和钮眼”写出了整风后领导干部参加实际生产，密切了与工人的关系，工人把这种新型的关系说成“支部书记、厂长和我们就像钮扣和钮眼，再也拆不散了”。说得多么确切、形象、感人啊！
    这“思想的火花”，语简意深，形式新颖，别具一格，可说是社会主义大跃进中的新式格言，它给人以光、热、力量。我们需要它！
