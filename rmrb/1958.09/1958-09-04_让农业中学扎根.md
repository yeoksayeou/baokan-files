　　Let Agricultural Middle Schools Take Root
　　Sun Zhen
    At the Jiangsu Province Agricultural Middle School Teacher Representatives Conference, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed that agricultural middle schools should "surpass regular middle schools in teaching and surpass veteran farmers in production." This is the direction for consolidating, improving, and running agricultural middle schools well. All agricultural middle schools should strive towards this direction.
    From the establishment of agricultural middle schools to the present, only a short half-year has passed, and they have already blossomed all over the country and taken root, receiving enthusiastic support and praise from the broad masses of people. This is not accidental. This is because the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production means that the people urgently need cultural, scientific, and technical knowledge, so agricultural middle schools can gain the support of the masses and can be further consolidated and improved.
    The educational policy put forward by the Party is that education must serve proletarian politics, and education must be combined with productive labor. Agricultural middle schools are a powerful pillar in implementing this policy. Under the premise of strengthening political and ideological work, students adhere to part-time study and part-time farming, and teachers adhere to teaching while farming, closely integrating teaching and production. Teachers and students have enriched their scientific knowledge and accumulated practical experience. Now, the experimental fields of some agricultural middle schools have grain yields that surpass those of local agricultural production cooperatives, and the practical knowledge of students in some agricultural middle schools exceeds that of students in ordinary middle schools. Of course, there are still a few "tide-watchers" who adopt an attitude towards the policy of combining education and productive labor, and they still harbor doubts, wait-and-see attitudes, and even opposition to the establishment of agricultural middle schools. They coldly observe and criticize the agricultural middle schools that have already been established. However, the achievements of agricultural middle schools are destined to make these tide-watchers fail.
    Now, the Party committees of many regions have made comprehensive plans for the consolidation and improvement of agricultural middle schools, and conduct regular inspections. The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and many county committees have also convened on-site meetings of agricultural middle schools, and leading cadres have personally gone deep into the field to summarize and exchange experiences, etc., which can make agricultural middle schools more consolidated and improved. As long as the teachers and all students of agricultural middle schools further recognize the new situation of our country's technological revolution and cultural revolution, adhere to part-time study and part-time farming, teaching while farming, rely on the leadership of the Party committee, rely on the masses, work hard to overcome difficulties, and are determined to be "in the agricultural middle school, heart in the agricultural middle school, red in the agricultural middle school, specialized in the agricultural middle school," agricultural middle schools will certainly be able to "surpass regular middle schools in teaching and surpass veteran farmers in production."

　　让农业中学扎根
　　孙振
    在江苏省农业中学教师代表会议上，中共江苏省委提出农业中学要作到“教学超普中，生产赛老农”。这是巩固提高和办好农业中学的方向。所有农业中学都应该向这个方向努力。
    从创办农业中学起到现在，才短短的半年时间，就已经在全国各地遍地开花并且扎下根来，得到了广大人民的热烈支持和赞扬。这并不是偶然的。这是因为工农业生产大跃进，人民群众迫切需要文化科学技术知识，所以农业中学就能够得到群众的支持，也就能够得到进一步巩固和提高。
    党提出的教育方针是，教育要为无产阶级政治服务，教育必须与生产劳动相结合。农业中学就是贯彻执行这一方针的有力支柱。他们在加强政治思想工作前提下，学生坚持半耕半读，教师坚持边耕边教，把教学和生产紧密结合起来，教师和学生都丰富了科学知识，并积累了实践经验。现在有的农业中学的试验田，粮食产量已经赛过当地农业生产合作社，有的农业中学的学生实际知识超过了普通中学的学生。当然，对待教育和生产劳动相结合方针的，也还有少数的“观潮派”，他们对创办农业中学还抱着怀疑、观望，甚至反对的态度。他们对已经办起来的农业中学，冷眼旁观，评头论足。但是，农业中学所得到的成绩，注定了这些观潮派的失败。
    现在，许多地区的党委对于农业中学的巩固提高已经作出全面规划，定期检查。中共江苏省委及许多县委还召开了农业中学现场会议，领导干部亲自深入现场，总结交流经验等等，这就能够使农业中学更加巩固和提高。只要农业中学的教师和全体学生进一步认识我们国家技术革命和文化革命的新形势，坚持半耕半读，边耕边教，依靠党委领导，依靠群众，努力克服困难，决心“人在农中，心在农中，红在农中，专在农中”，农业中学就一定可以“教学超普中，生产赛老农”。
