Which Factory Does Best in Sports Activities?
    Tianjin Leads in Both "Wool" and "Fur"
    (Our Dispatch) The Tianjin Fur Processing Factory and the "National Model Factory in Workers’ Sports" – the Tianjin Wool Processing Factory, simultaneously released two sports "satellites" on the 12th. All employees in the factories, except pregnant women, the weak, those unsuitable for participating in the labor-defense system exercises, and those working in other places, have passed the first-grade standard of the labor-defense system. The number of people in the Fur Factory is 533 (of which 19 have reached the second-grade standard of the labor-defense system). The number of people in the Wool Factory is 574 (of which 101 have reached the second-grade standard of the labor-defense system).
    Since the Fur Factory learned from the Tianjin Wool Factory's experience in carrying out mass sports activities, there has been great development in workers' sports. On August 11th, they officially started a vigorous campaign to pass the labor-defense system. At the beginning, some people held mysterious views about labor-defense system exercises, believing that they must have a "foundation" to practice. Some workers participated in exercises, but lacked confidence in meeting the labor-defense system standards. Therefore, the factory's Party General Branch Secretary took personal command, and many department heads and above took the lead in participating in exercises. In a few days, the first batch of 62 people, after testing, all reached the first-grade standard of the labor-defense system. Driven by these people, more and more people participated in exercises. By the end of August, more than 300 people had passed the test.
    The Wool Factory started carrying out the labor-defense system relatively early. They started vigorously in June. At the end of August, when they reported the good news to the Seventh Tianjin Workers’ Games, they guaranteed that by the end of September, all eligible employees in good health would pass the first grade of the labor-defense system as a gift to National Day. On September 2nd, the factory was awarded the title of "National Model Factory in Workers’ Sports." All employees were determined to make another leap forward and strive to complete the target of everyone passing the labor-defense system by the 13th.

    工厂体育活动谁家好
    天津“绒毛”“皮毛”双领先
    本报讯　天津皮毛整理厂和“全国职工体育运动红旗厂”——天津绒毛加工厂，12日同时放出了两颗体育“卫星”，全厂除孕妇、病弱、不适合参加劳卫制锻炼和外地工作的人员外，已全部通过劳卫制一级标准。皮毛厂的人数是五百三十三人（其中十九人达到劳卫制二级标准）。绒毛厂的人数是五百七十四人（其中一百零一人达到劳卫制二级标准）。
    皮毛厂自从学习了天津绒毛厂开展群众性体育运动的经验后，职工体育运动有很大发展，8月11日正式开始猛攻劳卫制。开始时，有些人对劳卫制锻炼存在着神秘观点，认为必须有“基础”才能练，有的工人虽然参加锻炼，但对达到劳卫制标准信心不足。于是工厂的党总支书记亲自挂帅，很多科长以上的干部都以身作则带头参加锻炼，几天的工夫，第一批六十二人经过测验，都达到劳卫制一级标准。在这些人的带动下，参加锻炼的人渐渐多起来了，到8月底已有三百多人测验及格了。
    绒毛厂开展劳卫制比较早，从6月份就大搞起来，8月底他们向天津市第七届工人运动会报捷时，保证9月底全厂体格正常的适龄职工都要通过劳卫制一级，作为向国庆节献礼。9月2日该厂被授予“全国职工体育运动红旗厂”称号，全体职工决心来个再跃进，争取13日完成人人劳卫制及格的指标。
