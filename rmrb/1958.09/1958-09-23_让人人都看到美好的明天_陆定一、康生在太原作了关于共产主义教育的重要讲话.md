Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 22nd. Comrade Lu Dingyi, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Comrade Kang Sheng, delivered important speeches on the afternoon of the 19th at an on-site conference convened by the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the CPC to promote the experience of the Communist education network of the Jinxi Machine Factory.

Comrade Lu Dingyi said that it is a remarkable event for workers to study philosophy. We were very pleased to hear that there are over a hundred thousand workers in Taiyuan studying philosophy. He said that we are currently building socialism, but the ultimate goal is to achieve a communist society. The Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas points out that to achieve a communist society, the following conditions must be met: extremely abundant material production, people with communist moral qualities, universal and improved education for all, the complete elimination of the differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, between mental and physical labor, and all remnants of bourgeois rights, and the disappearance of the state's function of internal suppression. In order to realize communism, we must resolutely and thoroughly carry out the socialist revolution and work hard to build socialism. Currently, our people across the country are fighting for steel and are also carrying out a great revolution in culture, education, science, and technology. In education, we must strive to basically universalize higher education within fifteen years, and then spend another fifteen years improving it. The cultural revolution has two aspects: both eliminating the lack of culture among workers and peasants, and eliminating bourgeois ideology among intellectuals. Therefore, it is necessary not only to popularize education but also to continue to deepen the ideological remolding of intellectuals. Some people believe that doing a good job in the cultural revolution means that intellectuals are "revolutionizing" the lack of culture among workers and peasants, which is a one-sided and incorrect view.

Comrade Lu Dingyi emphasized that eliminating bourgeois rights is one of the main symbols of achieving a communist society. He said that due to various reasons, some inequalities still have to be maintained in today's society. For example, we cannot talk about equality with criminals; instead, we should exercise dictatorship over them and force them to undergo labor reform, which is necessary. However, within the people, we should mainly rely on putting politics in command, communist education, following the mass line, and continuously improving people's ideological awareness and moral qualities, promoting collectivism, rather than solely stimulating people with material rewards. Our direction is to eliminate the differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor, rather than deepening these differences.

Comrade Lu Dingyi especially reminded everyone: We must see tomorrow in today. He said that in the past, there were two types of people who participated in the democratic revolution: one type thought of and saw the socialist revolution at the same time as engaging in the democratic revolution, and understood that engaging in the democratic revolution was for the purpose of engaging in the socialist revolution in the future; while the other type only saw the democratic revolution and did not think of or want to think about the socialist revolution. Now there are also two types of people: one type understands very well that his work is not only to accelerate the construction of socialism, but also to build tomorrow's communist society; while the other type is satisfied with today's socialism and does not want to move forward, does not want continuous revolution. Therefore, strengthening communist education, so that everyone clearly sees the bright tomorrow, will be the best motivation to inspire the communist drive of the people across the country.

In his speech, Comrade Kang Sheng focused on the great significance of factories running schools and conducting communist ideological education in factories. Comrade Kang Sheng said that no matter how many kinds of products your factory produces, there are only two kinds in summary: one is the material product that has no thought and cannot speak, and the other is the human product that has thought and can speak. All factories must not only strive to produce material products and create new products, but more importantly, must strive to cultivate new communist people. Because the quality of human products directly affects and determines the material products. Only by doing a good job in human products, so that everyone has a high degree of communist consciousness, has a high level of culture and science, and has a healthy physique, can the factory be run into a truly communist factory. Comrade Kang Sheng emphasized: All factory leading cadres must have a clear understanding of this point. We must not only thoroughly overcome the tendency of schools in the past to be divorced from production and reality, but also must overcome the tendency of "seeing things but not people" and neglecting the political and ideological education of people in some factory work in the past.

After explaining the importance of carrying out continuous revolution and communist education for the broad masses of people, Comrade Kang Sheng emphasized that factories are the best places to implement the Party Central Committee's educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, the best places to combine theory with practice, the best places to gradually eliminate the differences between physical and mental labor, and the best places to creatively develop Marxism.

Comrade Kang Sheng finally used the words "Heroes have great use for their abilities" to encourage the comrades present to work harder and harder, and to unremittingly struggle for running communist education well, running communist schools well, and running communist factories well.

    让人人都看到美好的明天
    陆定一、康生在太原作了关于共产主义教育的重要讲话
    新华社太原22日电　中共中央政治局候补委员陆定一同志和康生同志，19日下午在中共太原市委召开的推广晋西机器厂共产主义教育网经验的现场会议上作了重要讲话。
    陆定一同志说，工人学哲学是件很了不起的大事。太原有十几万工人学哲学，我们听说以后非常高兴。他说，我们现在是建设社会主义，但最终目标是要达到共产主义社会。中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议中指出，要达到共产主义社会，要有下列几个条件：物质生产非常丰富，人们有共产主义的道德品质，全民教育普及了而且提高了，工农之间的差别、城乡之间的差别、脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别和一切资产阶级法权残余彻底消灭了，国家对内镇压作用消失了。为了实现共产主义，我们就必须坚决彻底地进行社会主义革命和努力进行社会主义建设。现在我们全国人民正在为钢铁而战，同时正在进行文化教育、科学技术的大革命。在教育方面，我们要争取在十五年内基本上普及高等教育，然后再以十五年进行提高的工作。文化革命有两个方面，既要消灭工农群众缺乏文化的现象，同时也要消灭知识分子中的资产阶级思想。所以不但要普及教育而且还要继续深入地进行知识分子的思想改造工作。有些人认为搞好文化革命，就是知识分子“革”工农群众缺乏文化的“命”，这是片面的、错误的看法。
    陆定一同志强调说，消灭资产阶级法权是达到共产主义社会的主要标志之一。他说，由于种种原因，在今天的社会里，还不得不保留一些不平等。譬如，对犯罪分子，我们就不能和他们讲平等，而应对他们实行专政，强迫他们劳动改造，这是必须的。但在人民内部，我们则应主要靠政治挂帅，共产主义教育，走群众路线，不断地提高人们的思想觉悟和道德品质，提倡集体主义，而不应光拿物质奖励去刺激人。我们的方向，是消灭工农之间、城乡之间、脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别，而不是去加深这种差别。
    陆定一同志特别提醒大家：今天要看到明天。他说，过去搞民主革命的时候参加革命的就有两种人，一种人搞民主革命的同时就想到和看到了社会主义革命，而且懂得搞民主革命就是为了将来搞社会主义革命；而另一种人则只看到民主革命，想不到或者不愿意想社会主义革命。现在也有两种人，一种人非常懂得，他的工作不仅为了加快建成社会主义，而且是为了建设明天的共产主义社会；而另一种人则对今天的社会主义就心满意足了，不想前进了，不要不断革命了。因此，加强共产主义教育，让人人都清楚地看到美好明天，将是鼓舞全国人民共产主义干劲的最好的动力。
    康生同志讲话中着重论述了工厂办学校，工厂中进行共产主义思想教育的重大意义。康生同志说，不管你们工厂里生产多少种产品，但归结起来只有两种：一种是没有思想、不会说话的物的产品，一种是有思想的、会说话的人的产品。所有的工厂，不仅要努力生产物的产品和创造新产品，更重要的还要努力培养共产主义的新人。因为人的产品的质量，直接影响和决定着物的产品。只有把人的产品搞好了，使人人都具有高度的共产主义觉悟，又有很高的文化科学水平，并有健康的体质，才能把工厂办成真正共产主义的工厂。康生同志强调指出：对于这一点，所有的工厂领导干部，必须有明确的认识。我们不仅要彻底克服掉过去学校教育中存在着的脱离生产、脱离实际的倾向，还必须克服过去某些工厂工作中“见物不见人”、忽视人的政治思想教育工作的倾向。
    康生同志讲解了对广大人民群众进行不断革命和共产主义教育的重要性之后，着重说，工厂是贯彻党中央提出的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合这一教育方针的最好的场所，是理论与实践相结合最好的场所，是逐渐消灭体力劳动与脑力劳动差别最好的场所，是创造性地发展马克思主义最好的场所。
    康生同志最后用“英雄大有用武之地”的话鼓励到会同志加劲再加劲，为办好共产主义教育、办好共产主义的学校、办好共产主义的工厂而不懈地奋斗。
