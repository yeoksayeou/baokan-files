    The situation in the Taiwan Strait is unprecedentedly grave due to the frantic escalation of military provocations by the American aggressors!
    On September 18th and 19th, American warships violated our territorial waters eleven times, and expanded the range. American pirates have developed from spying on our Xiamen and Kinmen areas to the vast areas of Baiquan, Pingtan, and Dongding, completely disregarding the seven serious warnings issued by our government!
    Batches of American air force planes, including the repeatedly touted "Star" jet, equipped with the latest nuclear weapons, have been transferred to Taiwan. Martin, a spokesman for the US Forces Taiwan Command, even clamored that "American jet fighters have been ordered to 'attack and destroy' communist aircraft bombarding Kuomintang transport planes in the Kinmen area." He even issued a provocative rant, saying that "American planes may closely pursue communist planes, chase them to mainland Chinese bases, and then bomb these bases."
    The United States Navy has mobilized six aircraft carriers and approximately one hundred and thirty other ships, concentrating them in the Taiwan Strait area, including five aircraft carriers carrying nuclear weapons.
    "Matador" missiles have already been installed in Taiwan, ready to be launched at any time. It is said that other missile launch sites are being rushed to completion day and night. Recently, another battalion of "Nike" missile troops was transferred to Taiwan.
    Is all of this what Eisenhower "earnestly hopes" for? Is this the "peaceful solution" that Dulles "hopes to find"? Are these American armed forces in the Taiwan Strait area to "seek peace"? Any discerning person can see at a glance that the American aggressors are keen on war. The gentlemen in Washington are acting like Chicago thugs,妄想妄想 using atomic blackmail to coerce the Chinese people into forever abandoning their sacred right to liberate their ancestral territory of Taiwan and its coastal islands. They妄想妄想 want to use the occupied Taiwan and coastal islands as a base to prepare for war against China. At the same time, Dulles was ranting at the United Nations General Assembly, confusing right and wrong, and laying down a smokescreen for America's war preparations. Our Foreign Minister Chen Yi has issued a statement in this regard, sternly refuting Dulles' fallacies and issuing a serious warning to the United States.
    The American warmongers have miscalculated this time! The great Chinese people cannot be intimidated or defeated. Liberating Kinmen, Matsu and other coastal islands, liberating Taiwan, completely eliminating the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique from Chinese soil, realizing the unification of the motherland, and safeguarding the integrity of national territory and sovereignty are the firm and unshakable position of the Chinese people. No amount of American military threat can make the Chinese people retreat one step from this position! The Chinese people are definitely not the kind of people who tremble in fear in the face of the armed forces of imperialism. The Chinese people have never been afraid, and are even less afraid now, of the enemy imposing war on us. The long road of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle is a road filled with the flames of war. Whether it was the Kuomintang reactionaries, Japanese imperialism, or American imperialism, when they insisted on launching armed attacks against our people, our people rose up without hesitation to carry out armed resistance. No matter how great the difficulties and hardships, no matter how great the bloodshed and sacrifice, our people will not stop until the final victory is achieved. It is in the flames of war that our people have become more and more courageous and stronger and stronger. Haven't the American aggressors suffered enough in the Korean War? Then let them try again! American generals may think they have atomic weapons in their hands. But what does that count for?! Of course, we know that atomic weapons have tremendous destructive power, but it is not weapons but people that determine the outcome of war, and atomic weapons can never conquer six hundred million unyielding people. Please keep in mind, American generals, that the Chinese people's principle in dealing with enemies has always been "We will not attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly counter-attack." Our people have always responded to the enemy "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," giving the attacker a doubled blow. American generals had better remember that the United States is not the only country in the world that possesses atomic and hydrogen weapons. As Comrade Khrushchev said in his letter to Eisenhower: "Those who are planning an atomic attack on China should not forget that it is not only the United States, but also the other side that possesses atomic and hydrogen weapons and the corresponding tools to launch these weapons, and if the United States dares to launch such an attack on China, it will immediately be met with a deserved retaliation with similar weapons."
    The current situation in the Taiwan Strait is unprecedentedly critical. This is entirely created by the US authorities who are stepping up their military provocation policy there. In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly on September 18, Dulles tried to defend America's aggressive crimes, falsely claiming that the Chinese people's military actions to liberate their coastal islands were to "conquer by force" and "invade" the territory of "other countries." But even Dulles himself can hardly believe these lies. In the same speech, Dulles could not but admit that "the Chinese Communist attack is an act of civil war." Anyone with common sense will understand that since the Chinese people's liberation of Kinmen, Matsu and Taiwan is a civil war, with one side being the Chinese people and the other being the traitors of the Chinese people, where did the "other country" come from? Since it is a civil war, how can the Chinese people "invade" themselves? Since it is a civil war, how can the United States openly send warships, airplanes, and marines to China's territory and territorial waters to support and protect one side of the civil war that has long been abandoned by the Chinese people, and escape the charge of interfering in China's internal affairs? Since it is a civil war, and the United States is not a party to China's civil war, nor has it "fought" with China, then how can there be any "ceasefire" issue between China and the United States? Moreover, Kinmen and Matsu are both within China's inland sea, and even Dulles cannot but admit the fact that these coastal islands are "geographically close to mainland China," which cannot be ignored. The facts are completely opposite to Dulles's lies. It is the United States that wants to "conquer China by force" and "arm China". The United States has occupied China's Taiwan and driven the Chiang Kai-shek Group to gather one-third of its remaining forces in Kinmen and Matsu,妄想妄想 attempting to use this as a springboard to launch an attack on the Chinese mainland one day. The United States has concentrated an unprecedentedly large naval and air force in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait to prepare for a war against China,妄想妄想 attempting to "conquer China by force." Dulles's attempt to deceive world opinion with lies at the United Nations General Assembly is a futile effort. If he wants to use these lies to trick America's allies into the fire pit and launch a war against China together with the United States, then the fire of war will not only burn down American imperialism, but also burn down all the lackeys who follow America's war policy. In today's situation where the United States is unscrupulously stepping up military provocations and preparing for a nuclear war, whether a major war will be triggered in the Taiwan Strait area depends entirely on the United States. Only when the United States immediately withdraws its armed forces completely from the Taiwan Strait area can the crisis be eased. Because China has not sent a single soldier to American islands and coastal areas to threaten American security or to occupy American territory. It is entirely the United States that is creating the danger of war today, because it is the United States that has concentrated the largest naval and air force since World War II in the Taiwan Strait area to conduct military provocations against China. My Foreign Minister Chen Yi has pointed out in his statement: "In order to ease and eliminate the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait area, the United States must immediately stop its military provoc

### 美国强盗滚出台湾去！

    美国强盗滚出台湾去！
    台湾海峡地区的局势，由于美国侵略者疯狂地加紧了军事挑衅，空前地严重了！
    9月18、19两天，美国军舰侵犯我领海十一次，并且扩大了范围。美国海盗已从窥伺我厦门、金门地区，发展到白犬、平坛、东椗等广阔地带，对于我国政府的七次严重警告，竟置若罔闻！
    美国的空军，一批接一批地增调到台湾，其中包括美国一再吹嘘的什么星式喷气机，还配备有最新式核武器。侵台美军司令部的发言人马丁居然叫嚣什么“美国喷气式战斗机已经奉命‘攻击和击毁’在金门地区向国民党运输机轰击的共产党飞机”。他甚至发出挑战的狂言，说什么“美国飞机可能紧紧追着共产党的飞机，追到大陆中国基地，然后轰击这些基地”。
    美国海军已经调动了六艘航空母舰和约一百三十艘其他舰只，集中到台湾海峡地区，其中有五艘航空母舰是携带核弹的。
    美国“斗牛士式”导弹已经装置在台湾，准备随时发射。据说其他导弹发射场正在日夜赶修中。最近又有一个营的“奈克式”导弹部队调到了台湾。
    所有这些，就是艾森豪威尔“热诚地希望”的吗？就是杜勒斯“希望能够找到”的“和平解决的办法”吗？这些美国的武装力量是到台湾海峡地区来“寻求和平”吗？明眼人一望而知，美国侵略者正热中于战争。华盛顿的先生们活像芝加哥的流氓，他们妄想用原子讹诈来胁迫中国人民永远放弃解放自己祖国领土台湾和沿海岛屿的神圣权利。他们妄想以所占领的台湾和沿海岛屿为基地，准备对中国的战争。与此同时，杜勒斯在联合国大会上大放厥词，混淆是非，为美国的战争准备施放烟幕。我国外交部长陈毅为此发表了声明，严正驳斥了杜勒斯的谬论，并对美国提出了严重警告。
    美国的战争狂人们这次可是打错算盘了！伟大的中国人民是吓不了也打不倒的。解放金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，解放台湾，从中国的土地上彻底消灭蒋介石反动集团的残余势力，实现祖国的统一，维护国家的领土和主权的完整，是中国人民坚定不移的立场。美国的任何武力威胁休想使中国人民从这个立场后退一步！中国人民绝不是那种在帝国主义的武装力量面前吓得发抖的人。中国人民从不害怕、现在更加不害怕敌人把战争强加在我们头上。中国人民革命斗争的漫长的道路，是弥漫了战火的道路。无论是国民党反动派，无论是日本帝国主义，也无论是美帝国主义，当他们一定要向我国人民发动武装进攻的时候，我国人民就毫不迟疑地起来进行武装反抗。不管有多大的艰难困苦，也不管有多大的流血牺牲，我国人民不达最后胜利，誓不休止。我国人民就是这样地在战争的烽火中越战越勇，越战越强。美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上吃的苦头还不够吗？那就请他们再来试一试看！美国将军们也许以为他们手中有原子武器。可是，这又算得什么呢？！我们当然知道原子武器有巨大的破坏力，然而决定战争胜负的不是武器而是人，原子武器决不能征服六万万不屈的人民。请美国的将军们牢记，中国人民对付敌人的原则向来就是“人不犯我，我不犯人，人若犯我，我必犯人”。我国人民对于敌人向来是“以眼还眼、以牙还牙”，给打击者以加倍的打击的。美国的将军们最好还是记住，世界上并不是只有美国拥有原子武器和氢武器。正如赫鲁晓夫同志在给艾森豪威尔的信中所说的：“那些策划对中国进行原子进攻计划的人不应当忘记，并不只是美国，而且另一方也拥有原子武器和氢武器以及相应的发射这些武器的工具，如果美国竟然对中国发动这种进攻，那末，它就将立即遭到应有的、同类武器的反击。”
    目前台湾海峡的形势是空前危急的。这是在那里加紧推行军事挑衅政策的美国当局一手造成的。9月18日杜勒斯在联合国大会上的演说中，力图为美国的侵略罪行辩护，颠倒黑白地诬称中国人民为解放自己沿海岛屿所采取的军事行动是要“武力征服”和“侵略”“它国”领土。但是，这些鬼话，连杜勒斯自己也很难相信。就在同一篇演说里，杜勒斯不能不承认“中国共产党的进攻是一个内战行动”。任何具有普通常识的人都会懂得，既然中国人民解放金门、马祖和台湾是内战，作战的一方是中国人民，另一方是中国人民的叛逆，那里来的“它国”呢？既然是内战，怎么会发生中国人民自己“侵略”自己的问题呢？既然是内战，美国公然把军舰、飞机、海军陆战队开到中国的领土、领海上来，支持和保护早被中国人民所唾弃了的内战的一方，怎么能逃脱掉干涉中国内政的罪名呢？既然是内战，美国并非中国内战的一方，也没有同中国“战”起来，那末中美之间又怎么会发生什么“停火”问题呢？何况，金门、马祖都在中国的内海之内，连杜勒斯也不能不承认这些沿海岛屿“地理上靠近大陆中国”这一事实，不容漠视。事实和杜勒斯的谎言完全相反，要“武力征服”中国和“武装侵略中国”的正是美国。美国占领了中国的台湾，并驱使蒋介石集团在金门、马祖集结了它的残余兵力的三分之一，妄图以此作为跳板，有朝一日对中国大陆发动进攻。美国目前在台湾和台湾海峡集中了空前庞大的海空军力量，为的是准备对中国发动战争，妄图“武力征服”中国。杜勒斯在联合国大会上妄图用谎言来欺骗世界舆论是枉费心机的。如果他想用这些鬼话来把美国的盟国骗入火坑，和美国一道来发动对中国的战争，那末，战争的烈火将不仅把美帝国主义烧毁，而且把一切追随美国的战争政策的仆从也烧毁。在美国肆无忌惮地加紧军事挑衅和准备核战争的今天，台湾海峡地区是否触发大战，完全决定于美国。只有美国立即把武装部队完全撤出台湾海峡地区，才能使危局得到缓和。因为中国没有派一兵一卒到美国的海岛和沿海地区去威胁美国的安全，侵占美国的领土。今天造成战争危险的，完全是美国，因为正是美国在台湾海峡地区集中了第二次世界大战以来的最庞大的海空军部队，对中国进行军事挑衅。我外交部长陈毅已在声明中指出：“为了缓和和消除台湾海峡地区的紧张局势，美国必须立即停止对中国的军事挑衅和战争威胁，并且从台湾和台湾海峡撤出它的一切武装力量。美国武装力量一天不撤退，台湾海峡地区的紧张局势就一天不能消除。”
    中国政府和中国人民是爱好和平的。正因为这样，中国政府一再表示愿意通过谈判来解决中美之间在台湾地区的国际争端。美国当局虽然同意谈判，而且中美大使级的会谈已在华沙恢复，但是，正在这个时候，美国却大量增加它在台湾海峡地区的武装力量，并且加紧对中国的军事挑衅和战争威胁；杜勒斯竟然要求中国“停火”，放弃收复金门等沿海岛屿和解放台湾的神圣主权。这就使人不能不认定美国企图利用谈判作为烟幕，掩护它正在加紧进行的对中国的军事挑衅和战争准备。美国一定要我们在战争或者放弃主权之间抉择，我们还能作什么别的选择呢？陈毅外长的声明说：“如果美国侵略者竟然不顾中国人民的一再警告和世界人民的坚决反对，胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，那末，我国团结一致的六亿人民，必将不惜牺牲，在保卫伟大祖国的神圣旗帜下，为反抗侵略而战，为维护祖国的主权和领土完整而战，为保卫远东和世界的和平而战。”我国人民完全拥护陈毅外长的声明。我们一定保持高度警惕，准备给胆敢侵犯我国的美国侵略者以迎头痛击！
