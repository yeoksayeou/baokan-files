Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Montevideo: The Uruguayan newspaper "Popular" stated in an editorial titled "Latin America Hates American Policy" that the contradictions between the United States and Latin American countries are becoming increasingly acute, and the anti-imperialist sentiment and hatred of American policies among the people of Latin American countries have never been as widespread as they are today.

The editorial pointed out that more and more people in the broad strata of Latin America now believe that the most predatory American companies and trusts are colluding with the American government to intensify the arms race and create war hysteria in order to multiply their profits, stubbornly pursue the goal of dominating the world, and engage in disguised or even blatant interference in the internal affairs of other countries, which is despised by the people. The editorial pointed out that this aggressive policy of the United States has hit the broad strata of people in our Latin American countries, with the exception of a small handful who are colluding with American monopoly capital.

After describing the recent anti-American actions that have erupted in various Latin American countries, the editorial pointed out that these actions demonstrate the depth of anti-American sentiment among the people of the Americas. The people condemn this imperialist power—the common plunderer of Latin American countries, the supporter of the bloodiest dictatorships on the entire continent, and the strangler of the democratic regime in Guatemala. This proves that the contradictions between the United States and Latin American countries are becoming increasingly acute.

The editorial further pointed out that as American monopoly organizations see the ground beneath their feet shaking in the face of a new and serious cyclical crisis, they are intensifying their plunder of Latin American countries and shifting the consequences of the economic crisis to Latin American countries. The prices of Latin American countries' main export products such as copper, coffee, and wool are constantly falling. Taking the prices of 1953 as 100, in 1956 and 1957, the prices of the following products fell to: copper, 81 and 65; zinc, 95 and 80; coffee, 95 and 80; wool, 96 and 77. On the other hand, the prices of imported American goods are constantly rising, and American trusts are unscrupulously seizing excessive profits and doing everything possible to plunder. All of this has increased the hatred of the United States among the people of Latin American countries, even including those strata that have always welcomed American policies.

    帝国主义面目日益暴露
    拉丁美洲人民空前憎恨美国
    美国加紧对各国掠夺企图转嫁经济危机
    新华社10日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭“人民报”在一篇题为“拉丁美洲憎恶美国的政策”的社论中指出，美国与拉丁美洲国家之间的矛盾越来越尖锐，拉丁美洲国家的反帝国主义情绪以及对美国政策的憎恶从来没有像今天这么广泛。
    这篇社论指出，现在拉丁美洲广大阶层中有愈来愈多的人相信，美国最富掠夺性的公司和托拉斯同美国政府勾结在一起，为了使它们的利润成倍成倍地增长，加紧进行军备竞赛和制造战争歇斯底里，顽固地追求统治世界的目标，伪装地甚至赤裸裸地进行受到人们唾弃的干涉其他国家内政的活动。社论指出，美国的这种侵略政策打击了我们拉丁美洲各国的广大阶层的人民，只有一小撮同美国垄断资本勾结在一起的人例外。
    社论在叙述了最近以来在拉丁美洲各国暴发反美行动以后指出，这些行动表明了美洲各国人民反美情绪的深刻性。人民谴责这个帝国主义大国——拉丁美洲各国的共同掠夺者、整个大陆上最血腥的独裁政权的支持者以及危地马拉民主政权的扼杀者。这证明了美国同拉丁美洲各国之间的矛盾日益尖锐化。
    社论又指出，由于美国垄断组织看到它们脚下的土地在面临一个新的严重的周期性的危机的情况下正在动荡，于是就加紧对拉丁美洲国家进行掠夺，并且把经济危机的后果转嫁到拉丁美洲各国头上，拉丁美洲国家主要出口产品铜、咖啡、羊毛等的价格不断下降，如以1953年的价格作为一百，在1956年和1957年下列几种产品的价格分别降为：铜是八十一和六十五；锌是九十五和八十；咖啡是九十五和八十；羊毛是九十六和七十七。而另一方面进口的美国货的价格不断上涨，美国托辣斯不择手段地攫取超额利润，千方百计地进行掠夺，所有这些已经增强了拉丁美洲各国人民、甚至包括那样历来欢迎美国政策的阶层对美国憎恶。
