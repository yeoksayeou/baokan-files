Xinhua News Agency, 16th.  After attending the Fifth Congress of the International Student Union, one hundred and seventy-nine student representatives from fifty-three countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America gathered in Beijing today to discuss common and vital issues for students in these regions in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for the defense of world peace, and to strengthen mutual unity and cooperation.

The representatives unanimously pointed out that students in Asia, Africa, and Latin America today share a common destiny, common problems, and common goals: opposing imperialist aggression, opposing colonialism, opposing wars of aggression, and defending world peace. Students in these regions must strengthen unity and cooperation in this common struggle.  Hu Qili, the Chinese student representative, said that the common enemies of the people and students of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are imperialism and colonialism. Students must unite on the basis of the Bandung Conference spirit of equality, mutual support, mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and mutual consultation; such unity cannot be undermined by any force.

After a heated discussion, the representatives attending the meeting issued a communique.  The communique stated that the representatives of student organizations from Asia, Africa, and Latin America in Beijing once again noted the common conditions, problems, and aspirations of students in these regions, such as safeguarding world peace, striving for national independence, opposing imperialism and colonialism, building their countries, striving for the development of national economies and national cultures, defending student rights, democratizing education, and improving students' learning and living conditions.

The communique stated that the representatives recognized the common aspirations and increasing unity among students in these regions to rationally solve these problems and contribute to cooperation, friendship, and unity among international students. Therefore, the representatives agreed to convey the aspirations expressed at this meeting to their respective student organizations so that these organizations can make the necessary contacts and efforts to seek effective and practical forms of cooperation in the common struggle, such as mutual support and solidarity, frequent contact, exchange of delegations, information, and publications, especially through an Asian, African, and Latin American student conference to further develop and strengthen cooperation among students in these three regions.

    代表们一致指出，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的学生今天有着共同的命运、共同的问题和目标，这就是反对帝国主义侵略、反对殖民主义、反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平。在这个共同的斗争中这些地区的学生必须加强团结和合作。中国学生代表胡启立说，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民和学生的共同敌人是帝国主义和殖民主义。学生们必须根据万隆会议精神在平等、互相支持、互相尊重、不干涉各国内部事务和互相协商的基础上团结起来，这样的团结是任何力量也不能破坏的。
    经过热烈的讨论后，参加这次会见的代表在会上发表了一个公报。公报中说，在北京的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的学生组织代表再一次注意到这些地区学生的共同条件、问题和愿望，例如维护世界和平、争取民族独立、反对帝国主义和殖民主义、建设国家、争取国民经济和民族文化的发展，保卫学生权利、教育民主化以及改善学生学习和生活条件。
    公报说，代表们认识到在这些地区的学生中存在共同的愿望和日益加强的团结，以期合理解决这些问题，并对国际学生间的合作、友谊和团结作出贡献。因此代表们同意把这次会见中所表达的愿望转达给各自的学生组织，以便这些组织作必要的接触和努力来寻求共同斗争中的有效而切实的合作形式，例如互相支持和团结，经常接触，交换代表团、情况和出版物等，尤其是可以通过一次亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的学生会议，来进一步发展和加强这三个地区学生间的合作。
