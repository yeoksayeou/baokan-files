Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 21st – The people of Wuhan gathered today to enthusiastically support Foreign Minister Chen Yi’s statement, vehemently denouncing the shameless slander uttered by war-monger Dulles at the United Nations General Assembly, and determined to contribute all their strength to the sacred cause of liberating Jinmen and Mazu and safeguarding the integrity of the motherland's territory.

The workers of various factories are most angered by the war-monger Dulles's slander of the just cause of the Chinese people liberating their own territory of Taiwan and coastal islands as "aggression." They unanimously pointed out that this is a shameless trick of the US imperialism to confuse right and wrong, and it cannot deceive anyone. Workers at the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and the Heavy Machinery Plant swore at the rally that they were determined to accelerate construction, produce more steel and various machines, and fully support the People's Liberation Army in its struggle to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan.

The maritime workers, who suffered greatly from the oppression of the American invaders before liberation, are particularly indignant at the military provocations of US imperialism. This morning, the crew of the "People No. 4" ship, which had just arrived in Hankou from Chongqing, held a meeting on board to enthusiastically support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement. Wang Shaoting, a naval veteran who participated in the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island, said that US imperialism is following the old path of Japanese imperialism, occupying our territory of Taiwan, as a military springboard for invading our mainland, and the Chinese people will never agree to this. He stated that once needed, he would immediately return to the front line, determined to defend the integrity of the motherland's territory with his life and blood.

Today, after reading Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, the workers of Wuchang Shipyard immediately formed a militia division. As of the 19th, 200,000 militiamen have been organized in Wuhan.

    为维护祖国领土的完整
    武汉人民愿贡献一切力量
    新华社武汉21日电　武汉市人民今天纷纷集会，热烈拥护陈毅外长的声明，痛斥战争贩子杜勒斯在联合国大会上发出的无耻谰言，决心为解放金门、马祖，为维护祖国领土完整的神圣事业贡献一切力量。
    各工厂职工们对战争流氓杜勒斯污蔑中国人民解放自己领土台湾和沿海岛屿的正义事业为“侵略”，最为愤怒。他们一致指出，这是美帝国主义惯用的颠倒是非的无耻伎俩，决不能欺骗任何人。武汉钢铁公司和重型机床厂的工人们在集会上宣誓，决心加速建设，多出钢铁和各种机械，全力支援解放军解放金门、马祖和台湾的斗争。
    解放前饱尝美国侵略者欺压的海员工人们，对于美帝国主义的军事挑衅尤为激愤。今天上午刚刚从重庆开到汉口的“人民四号”轮船的职工，在船上开会，热烈拥护陈毅外长的声明。参加过解放一江山岛战役的海军复员军人王少亭说，美帝国主义走日本帝国主义的老路，侵占我国领土台湾，作为侵略我国大陆的军事跳板，中国人民决不答应。他表示一旦需要，就立即返回前线，决心用生命和鲜血保卫祖国领土的完整。
    今天，武昌造船厂职工在读到了陈毅外长的声明以后，立即成立了一个民兵师。到19日为止，武汉市组织起来的民兵已有二十万人。
