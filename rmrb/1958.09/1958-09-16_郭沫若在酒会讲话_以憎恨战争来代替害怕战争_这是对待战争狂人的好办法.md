Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: Guo Moruo's speech at the reception he held today to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the International Union of Students is as follows:

Dear friends:

Your meeting has come to a successful conclusion. On behalf of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and the Chinese people, I congratulate you.

In your meeting, you passed resolutions condemning the United States' aggression against Taiwan and its shameless interference in China's internal affairs, and demanding that the American and British aggressors immediately withdraw their troops from the Middle East. This has made a very good contribution to the cause of maintaining peace in Asia and the world. I express my respect to you and extend my sincere greetings.

You are the masters of the future world. You are already participating in international affairs, and you will participate more and more comprehensively in the future. When you take charge of affairs in countries around the world, there is no doubt that international relations and human welfare will be further advanced.

You have always been accustomed to emphasizing unity and making friends among international students, opposing division and confrontation; accustomed to reasoning, opposing unreasonableness; accustomed to facing reality, opposing distorting reality; accustomed to mutual understanding, mutual learning, and mutual respect, opposing acting arbitrarily, being arrogant, and looking down on others; accustomed to mutual assistance, seeking common welfare, and seeking common progress, opposing acting independently, harming others for self-interest, and being reactionary and backward; accustomed to correctly handling contradictions between each other, opposing deliberately expanding contradictions.

These are all very common principles, but they are also the great principles for handling national affairs and international affairs.

You are well-versed in these principles and methods. I want to say again, when you take charge of the affairs of various countries in the future, international relations and human living conditions will definitely be much better than today. We want to cheer for this bright future!

During your meeting, you encountered the US government creating tension in the Taiwan Strait, causing a lot of smoke and dragging the world to the brink of a third world war.

You are very concerned and participated in the parade of three million people in Beijing on the 7th of this month. Many friends also wrote enthusiastic poems to support us. Thank you.

I believe you have gained something in this incident. There is a Chinese saying, "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." Now you have seen with your own eyes: how unreasonable and distorting reality the US government is!

Mr. Dulles and Mr. Eisenhower say that we Chinese are "invading" ourselves, "invading" Jinmen, Mazu, Penghu, and Taiwan, while the United States sends its navy and air force five thousand miles away from the United States to flaunt its power and occupy those places, which is "opposing aggression and defending peace." Is there such logic in the world?

But such logic is often used by Mr. Dulles and Mr. Eisenhower. Koreans "invade" Korea, Vietnamese "invade" Vietnam, Lebanese "invade" Lebanon, Jordanians "invade" Jordan, Arabs "invade" Arabia, Indonesians "invade" Indonesia, people all over the world are "aggressors," and only Mr. Dulles can be considered the most comprehensive "defender of world peace."

They are trying to deceive others, but I don't think they can even deceive themselves. Who believes them? Except for the small group of treasures they usually keep there, such as Syngman Rhee and the like.

The most unreasonable people are also the most unrealistic. In the eyes of Dulles and Eisenhower, the People's Republic of China, which represents 600 million people, does not exist. There is no such country on earth. 600 million people are just strings of zeros. Look, is there such a strange thing in the world?

However, in the eyes of Mr. Dulles, it is not surprising at all. Jordan has only one Hussein, Lebanon has only one Chamoun, Korea has only one Syngman Rhee, and China has only one Chiang Kai-shek. Needless to say, these treasures are just their watchdogs. They want to dominate the world, so they are arrogant. The whole world is a vacuum.

We have an ancient saying, "Those who commit many injustices will destroy themselves." This means that doing too many unreasonable things will kill oneself.

Chairman Mao said it well, Mr. Dulles is putting the noose around his own neck and handing the end of the noose to us. The length of the noose is limited, and the more loops around the neck, the tighter it will be. I think, we probably don't need to pull it, and the person who should be hanged will hang himself.

Friends, you should see it very clearly. We Chinese people love peace, but we are not afraid of war.

Warmongers use war, atomic bombs, and hydrogen bombs to intimidate people, to make you afraid. If you are afraid, isn't that exactly what they want?

So we Chinese people are not afraid of war, but hate war; not afraid of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, but hate atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. What's the use of being afraid? The more afraid you are, the worse it gets. What warmongers and all violentists exploit is this psychology of fear. If we have a psychology of fear, they can do whatever they want and make trouble.

We Chinese people are not afraid, but we are prepared. We have enough strength to defend ourselves; our friends are all over the world, including inside the United States. If you, Dulles and Eisenhower, want to attack, then we will not be polite at all. We have the power to eliminate war and eliminate imperialism. Replacing fear of war with hatred of war is a good way to deal with warmongers and violentists. I would like to offer it to you for reference.

According to our experience, the most tyrannical people are the most timid. Mr. Dulles used war and atomic weapons to intimidate us. When they saw that we were not afraid, they became afraid themselves. The Sino-US ambassadorial talks were unilaterally interrupted by them for a long time. We have repeatedly requested resumption and set deadlines, but they ignored them. Now, because they are afraid that it will become a reality and a real war will break out, they have suddenly agreed to sit down and negotiate in Warsaw.

Warmongers are the opposite of us. If they are afraid of war, that is very good. The more afraid they are, the better. This gives them a chance to wake up.

We have always advocated peaceful coexistence and resolving international disputes through peaceful negotiations. As long as you, the United States, are willing to sit down and talk, you can talk for five or ten years. Of course, we hope to solve the problem quickly. This is good for Mr. Dulles. Isn't it good to take off the noose around your neck?

Reason must always be spoken, and facts cannot be erased. Taiwan is always China's Taiwan, not the United States' Taiwan. Although your US government does not recognize the People's Republic of China, it still exists and is constantly making great leaps forward.

It is always impossible to not reason or distort the facts. Human history has always been like this. This also guarantees the continuous progress of mankind. We have developed from the Paleolithic Age to today's atomic energy age. History has entered the stage of conscious development from the stage of natural development. Mankind has gradually been able to control its own destiny and can actively make the development of nature and society conducive to the improvement of mankind's material and cultural life. We are all working together for this noble cause.

The people of all countries in the world are our friends. We are willing to join hands frequently to fight to eliminate unreasonableness and eliminate all reactionary and backward phenomena that hinder human progress!

I propose: To the health of all friends, to the friendship between students and people of all countries, to world peace and human happiness, let us all drink!

### 郭沫若在酒会讲话  以憎恨战争来代替害怕战争  这是对待战争狂人的好办法

    郭沫若在酒会讲话
    以憎恨战争来代替害怕战争
    这是对待战争狂人的好办法
    新华社15日讯　郭沫若今天在他举行的庆祝国际学生联合会第五届代表大会胜利闭幕的酒会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    你们的会议胜利结束了，我代表中国科学院、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国人民，向你们祝贺。
    你们在会议上通过了决议，谴责了美国侵略台湾，无耻地干涉中国内政，并要求美英侵略者立即从中东撤兵，这在维护亚洲和世界和平事业上，作出了很好的贡献。我向你们表示敬意，并表示亲切的慰劳。
    你们是世界未来的主人。你们已经在参预国际事务，将来会更多、更全面地参预。到世界各国由你们当家作主的时候，毫无疑问，国际关系、人类福利是会更有进展的。
    你们一向习惯于在国际学生之间，讲团结、交朋友，而反对闹分裂、搞对立；习惯于讲道理，而反对不讲道理；习惯于正视现实，而反对歪曲现实；习惯于相互了解、互相学习、相互尊重，而反对独行独断、自高自大、轻视别人；习惯于相互协助、共谋福利、共求进步，而反对各自为政、损人利己、反动落后；习惯于正确地处理相互之间的矛盾，而反对存心扩大矛盾。
    这些都是很平常的道理，但这些也就是处理国家事务和国际事务的大道理。
    你们对于这些道理和处理方法都行之有素。我要再说一遍，将来各国事务由你们当家作主的时候，国际关系和人类生活状况一定会比今天好得多。我们要为这个光辉的远景欢呼！
    你们在开会期间正碰着美国政府在台湾海峡搞紧张局势，搞得乌烟瘴气，把世界拖到了第三次大战的边缘。
    你们很关心，参加了本月7日三百万北京市人民的游行示威。有不少朋友还做了热情的诗来支援我们。谢谢你们。
    你们在这个事件中，我相信，是有所收获的。中国有句话，叫作“百闻不如一见”。你们现在是亲眼看见了：美国政府是怎样的不讲道理和歪曲现实！
    杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔先生们说我们中国人“侵略”自己，“侵略”金门、马祖、澎湖、台湾，而他美国派遣海军空军离开美国国境五千哩来耀武扬威，霸占着那些地方，却是“反对侵略、保卫和平”。天地间有这样的逻辑吗？
    但这样的逻辑，在杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔先生们却是经常使用的。朝鲜人“侵略”朝鲜、越南人“侵略”越南、黎巴嫩人“侵略”黎巴嫩、约旦人“侵略”约旦、阿拉伯人“侵略”阿拉伯、印度尼西亚人“侵略”印度尼西亚，全世界人民都是“侵略者”，就只有杜勒斯先生们要算是最全面的“世界和平保卫者”了。
    他们是在想欺骗别人，但我看他们连自己也欺骗不了。谁在相信他们呢？除掉他们平时养在那儿的一小撮宝贝，如像李承晚之流。
    最不讲道理的人也是最不正视现实的。在杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔他们的眼里，代表六亿人民的中华人民共和国是不存在的，地球上没有这个国家。六亿人民也只是一串串零。你们看，天地间有这样的怪事吗？
    然而，在杜勒斯先生们看来却一点也不奇怪，约旦就只有一个侯赛因，黎巴嫩就只有一个夏蒙，朝鲜就只有一个李承晚，中国就只有一个蒋介石。用不着说穿，这些宝贝都不过是他们的看门狗。他们想要独霸世界，故而目中无人。全世界都是真空地带。
    我们有句古话，叫“多行不义必自毙”。这意思是说：不合道理的事情做多了，会自己坑杀自己。
    毛主席说得好，杜勒斯先生们是在自己把绞刑索自行套在颈子上，而把绞索的一端交到我们手里。绞索的长度是有限的，套在颈子上的圈子愈多便会愈紧。我看，恐怕用不着我们拉，该受绞刑的人就会把自己绞死了。
    朋友们，你们应该看得很清楚。我们中国人民是热爱和平的，但并不害怕战争。
    战争狂人就是拿战争、拿原子弹、氢弹来恫骇人，叫你害怕的；你如果害怕了，那不是正中了他的诡计？
    所以我们中国人民不是害怕战争，而是憎恨战争；不是害怕原子弹、氢弹，而是憎恨原子弹、氢弹。你害怕有什么用？愈害怕愈糟糕。战争狂人们乃至一切暴力主义者所利用的就是这种害怕的心理。我们如果有了害怕的心理，他们就可以为所欲为，兴妖作怪了。
    我们中国人民就是不怕，但我们是有准备的。我们有足够的力量保卫自己；我们的朋友遍于全世界，美国内部也有。你杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔如果要动手，那我们就一点也不客气。我们有力量消灭战争并消灭帝国主义。以憎恨战争来代替害怕战争，这是对待战争狂人和暴力主义的好办法。我想提供给各位参考。
    根据我们的经验，最横暴的人却是最胆怯的人。杜勒斯先生们拿战争和原子武器来恫骇我们，他们看见我们不怕，自己倒害怕起来了。中美大使级会谈被他们片面中断了很久，我们几次要求恢复，并限期要求，他们都置之不理。现在他们由于害怕弄假成真，战争真正打起来，却急转直下地同意在华沙坐下来谈判了。
    战争狂人们是和我们相反的，他们如果害怕战争，那就很好。他们愈害怕，愈好。这使他们自己有了清醒的机会。
    我们是一贯主张和平共处，用和平谈判来解决国际争端的。只要你美国肯坐下来谈，就和它谈五年、十年都可以。当然，我们希望迅速地解决问题。这样对于杜勒斯先生们是有好处的。把套在颈上的绞刑索解下来，不是很好吗？
    道理总是要讲的，事实是不能抹杀的。台湾始终是中国的台湾，不是你美国的台湾。中华人民共和国尽管你美国政府不承认，但他依然存在着，而且不断地在大跃进。
    不讲道理、歪曲事实，总是行不通的。人类历史从来就是这样。这也就保障了人类的不断进步。我们是从旧石器时代发展到今天的原子能时代了。历史已经由自然发展的阶段进入自觉发展的阶段了。人类已经逐渐能够掌握自己的命运，而且能够主动地使自然和社会的发展有利于人类物质生活和文化生活的提高。我们大家正在为这个崇高的事业而共同努力。
    世界各国的人民都是我们的朋友。我们愿意经常携起手来，为消除不合理，消除阻碍人类进步的一切反动落后的现象而斗争！
    我建议：为各位朋友的健康，为各国学生和人民之间的友谊，为世界和平和人类幸福，大家干杯！
