　　Old Tradition Creates New Speed
    Fourteen Days to Build Small Shijingshan Steel Plant
    (Our report) Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant workers, with the practical action of rapidly building a converter workshop and producing steel ahead of schedule, supported Premier Zhou's statement and fought back against the military threats and war provocations of U.S. imperialism.
    It only took this plant fourteen days to build a converter steelmaking workshop with an annual output of 100,000 tons of steel. It officially started construction on August 24th, and after fourteen days and nights of hard work by the workers, it was completed on the 7th, and the first batch of molten steel was successfully smelted at 1:26 am on the 8th.
    This steelmaking workshop was built by the workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in response to the central government's call for increased steel production. The factory's Party committee decided to build this steelmaking workshop with the fighting spirit of starting from scratch and racing against time. From equipment manufacturing to civil construction and installation, everything was contracted by themselves, and a bold plan was made to complete the construction and put it into production within half a month. After the plan was determined, it only took one day to select the factory site and prepare the construction equipment and materials. During the construction process, all the workers of the plant demonstrated a high degree of cooperation, and they all considered it the greatest honor to contribute all their strength to the early production of steel from this workshop. They participated in voluntary labor on the construction site day and night, and the slogan of competing with time for steel resounded throughout the construction site.
    When the workers heard Premier Zhou Enlai's statement, they were even more encouraged and expressed their determination to accelerate steel production in order to fight back against the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism. Li Bingjun, the foreman of the fitter team that installed the No. 2 converter, said, "Liberating Taiwan requires artillery shells, and steel is artillery shells. We must produce steel as soon as possible." This fitter team worked all night on the 6th to ensure that the newly built converter would be put into production as soon as possible. Now, all the construction workers have put forward a new task: before the National Day, to expand the capacity of this steelmaking workshop to an annual output of 250,000 tons of steel, and to strike an even more powerful blow against the American warmongers.

　　老传统创造新速度
    十四天建成小石钢
    本报讯　石景山钢铁厂职工以快速建设转炉车间和提早出钢的实际行动，拥护周总理的声明，回击美帝国主义的军事威胁和战争挑衅。
    这个厂建设一座年产十万吨钢的转炉炼钢车间，前后只有十四天，从8月24日正式动工，经过职工十四昼夜的苦战，已经在7日建成，并在八日早晨一时二十六分试炼出了第一炉钢水。
    这个炼钢车间，是石景山钢铁厂职工响应中央关于增产钢的号召而兴建的。工厂党委会决定以平地起家和分秒必争的战斗精神，来建设这个炼钢车间，从设备制造到土建、安装，全部由自己包下，并大胆订出了半月内建成和投入生产的计划。计划确定以后，只经过一天的时间，就选好了厂地，做好了施工设备和材料准备工作。全厂职工在建设过程中，发挥了高度的大协作精神，都以为这个车间早日出钢贡献一切力量为最大的光荣。他们不分日夜地到工地上参加义务劳动、工地上始终响彻着与时间争钢的口号。
    当工人们听到周恩来总理的声明时，心情更为振奋，纷纷表示加速出钢，来回击美帝国主义的侵略行为。安装二号转炉的钳工工长李秉钧说：“解放台湾需要炮弹，钢铁就是炮弹，我们要早日使钢铁生产出来。”这个钳工组，6日晚上干了一个彻夜，保证新建的转炉早日投入生产。现在，全体建设职工又提出新的任务：在国庆节前，把这个炼钢车间能力扩建成为年产二十五万吨钢，更厉害地打击美国战争贩子。
