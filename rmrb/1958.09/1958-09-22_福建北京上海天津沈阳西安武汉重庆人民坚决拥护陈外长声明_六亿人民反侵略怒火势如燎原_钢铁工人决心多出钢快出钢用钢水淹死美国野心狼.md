Xinhua News Agency Report: Reports from Fujian, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Xi'an, Wuhan, and Chongqing indicate that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's solemn statement refuting the speech of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles at the United Nations General Assembly has ignited a new wave of anger against the war provocations of the American aggressors among the people of the whole country.

The three armed forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front, including the army, navy, and air force, warmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement refuting Dulles' speech at the United Nations General Assembly. They firmly stated: We are ready at any time to await the orders of the motherland, to fight heroically to resist aggression, safeguard the integrity of the motherland's territorial sovereignty, and defend world peace.

People from all walks of life in Fujian Province have expressed their determination to further improve various preparatory work and fight to the end for the liberation of Jinmen, Mazu, and the liberation of Taiwan. More than 1,300 seamen from the Fuzhou Maritime Administration Bureau expressed their determination to excellently complete the task of supporting the front. Four hundred support-the-front civilian laborers from the Gushan People's Commune on the outskirts of Fuzhou, who were fully prepared to depart, unanimously proposed to guarantee the completion of the support-the-front task. Civilian laborer Guo Nudi and militia captain Ye Biliang resolutely said: If the American bandits dare to slap us once, we will definitely return them ten punches. Wang Tianqiang, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Fujian Provincial Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, and Lin Zhuguang, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and a returned overseas Chinese from Malaya, issued statements supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement.

Yesterday, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and businessmen in Beijing gave up their Sunday holidays and held anti-aggression rallies. Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant angrily accused Eisenhower and Dulles, saying that if you insist on imposing war on us, we will not hesitate to fight to resist aggression and safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland! Members of the Dongfanghong People's Commune held field meetings during their rest breaks. In order to defend their beautiful lives, they vowed to stand on the front line of attacking the aggressors. Students at Tsinghua University held rallies in the afternoon, and more than 10,000 teachers, students, and staff held a conference in the evening. Shop assistants also expressed their readiness to put down their abacuses and take up guns to go to the front at any time.

The employees of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, who are fighting day and night for the city's annual production of 1.2 million tons of steel, held rallies next to the steelmaking furnaces and on the construction sites of new plants to express their determination. Hundreds of workers in the newly built giant converter workshop raised their fists and swore to the Party and the motherland: The motherland wants steel, we have steel; wants people, we will put down our tools and pick up guns to fight to the end to defend the socialist construction of the motherland! At the establishment meeting of the "July 1st" People's Commune in the suburbs, militiamen held up their guns to express their determination to defend the motherland. Teachers and students of various universities in Shanghai, which have fully implemented militarization, are determined to strengthen military training. Jin Zhonghua, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and heads of local organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai, unanimously supported Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement refuting Dulles.

Liu Rude, foreman of the A shift in the steelmaking workshop of the Tianjin Xinhe Steel Plant, who has repeatedly set new records in the city's converter steelmaking production, said angrily, we must produce more steel and produce steel faster, so that molten steel can drown the American wolves. Zhang Guofan, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and a physicist, said that there is no such thing as a "ceasefire" at all, but the issue is the American imperialists getting out of Taiwan. All teachers, students, and staff of Tianjin University, which has just established the "Dongfeng Militia Division," unanimously supported the statement of Foreign Minister Chen Yi.

People from all walks of life in Shenyang held rallies yesterday to firmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and angrily condemn Dulles' absurd remarks attempting to continue to expand aggression against our country.
