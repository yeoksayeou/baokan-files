Xinhua News Agency, 23rd -- Mahmoud, President of the Iraqi National Lawyers Association, said in Beijing tonight that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and American imperialism should quickly withdraw from the Chinese people's unliberated land, and this land should be returned to the Chinese people.

Mahmoud said at a reception held by Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, to welcome the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China that he led, "You have a firm will and powerful strength. Whenever you want to drive away imperialism, you can drive away imperialism. You have the support of people all over the world, including the people of Iraq."

The head of the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation said, "The great achievements you have made in construction have made you even stronger. The stronger you are, the more secure we feel. We are fighting the same enemy together with you, whether in the Far East or in the Middle East. Your security is our security, and our security is your security. Therefore, we are close partners in the struggle against imperialism."

Mahmoud said that the Iraqi people did their best to liberate their country and finally won victory. In the early days of our revolutionary victory, when imperialism threatened us and wanted to eliminate our new system, you always stood by our side. You encouraged our courage to fight and made us feel not isolated. We have many, many friends, and among these friends are the great Chinese people. Our visit to China this time is to express our gratitude to the Chinese people, to express our respect to the Chinese people, and to understand the achievements the Chinese people have made in construction.

Tonight, well-known figures from all walks of life in the capital, including Chen Shutong, Liao Chengzhi, Shi Liang, Xu Guangping, Wu Defeng, Zhang Zhirang, Zhang Youyu, Ding Xilin, Da Punsheng, Zhou Gengsheng, Wang Yunsheng, etc., attended the reception.

At the beginning of the reception, Zhang Xiruo delivered a speech to welcome the distinguished guests. He said that our people are waging a resolute struggle to liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan and to liberate Jinmen and Mazu. At this time, the arrival of our Iraqi friends will greatly encourage our people's determination to fight American imperialism to the end.

Zhang Xiruo said that the Chinese and Iraqi people have long suffered from imperialist aggression and plunder. Therefore, the Chinese people are particularly full of brotherly sympathy for the Iraqi people's heroic struggle and expressed their firm support. We feel from the bottom of our hearts that the Iraqi people's struggle is our struggle; the Iraqi people's victory is our victory.

Zhang Xiruo said that the victory of the Iraqi people is another new and significant victory in a series of great victories achieved by the Asian and African people in recent years. At the same time, we see that the imperialists are not reconciled to their defeat. They vainly attempt to save their defeat by force, sending troops to occupy Lebanon and Jordan, threatening Iraq, but now the Iraqi people have stood up, the strength of the Arab people is stronger than before, and the Asian and African people's struggle for independence has been supported by the people of the world, especially the people of socialist countries. The colonialists of the United States and Britain will surely be burned to a frazzle in the raging fire of national liberation.

Zhang Xiruo finally said that we believe that through the visit of our Iraqi friends, the understanding and friendship between our two peoples will be greatly enhanced. It will lay a solid foundation for our increasingly frequent friendly exchanges in the future.

In the middle of the reception, the Chinese and Iraqis drank and talked together like close friends. They rejoiced for their common victory and expressed their firm will for their common struggle. There is no distinction between host and guest here. As head of delegation Mahmoud said: "We feel that we are the masters of this country, and it is really a difficult thing to leave you and go back to our hometown in the future."

    马哈茂德在张奚若举行的酒会上说
    中国人民有力量赶走帝国主义
    伊中人民是反帝斗争中的亲密伙伴
    新华社23日讯　伊拉克全国律师协会主席马哈茂德今晚在北京说，台湾是中国的领土，美帝国主义应该迅速从中国人民还未解放的土地上退出去，这些土地应该归还中国人民。
    马哈茂德在中国人民外交学会会长张奚若欢迎他所率领的伊拉克人民友好访华团的酒会上说，你们有坚定的意志和强大的力量，什么时候要赶走帝国主义，什么时候就能赶走帝国主义。你们有全世界各国人民的支持，在这些人民中，就有我们伊拉克人民。
    这位伊拉克人民友好访华团团长说，你们在建设中取得的巨大成就，使你们更加强大。你们越强大，我们就越感到我们的安全有保证。我们同你们一起在和共同的敌人作斗争，不论在远东还是在中东。你们的安全就是我们的安全，我们的安全也是你们的安全。所以在同帝国主义的斗争中我们是亲密的伙伴。
    马哈茂德说，伊拉克人民尽了最大的力量解放了自己的国家，最后获得了胜利。在我们革命胜利的初期，当帝国主义威胁我们想消灭我们新制度的时候，你们始终站在我们这一边，你们鼓舞了我们斗争的勇气，使我们感到不是孤立的。我们有许许多多朋友，在这些朋友当中，就有伟大的中国人民。我们这次访问中国，就是为了向中国人民表示感谢，向中国人民表示敬意，并且了解中国人民在建设中取得的成就。
    今晚，首都各界著名人士陈叔通、廖承志、史良、许广平、吴德峰、张志让、张友渔、丁西林、达浦生、周鲠生、王芸生等都出席了酒会。
    在酒会开始的时候，张奚若致词欢迎贵宾。他说，我国人民正在为解放我们的神圣领土台湾、为解放金门、马祖而进行着坚决的斗争。在这个时候，伊拉克朋友们的到来，更将大大地鼓舞我国人民跟美帝国主义斗争到底的决心。
    张奚若说，中国人民和伊拉克人民都曾长久地遭受帝国主义的侵略和掠夺。因而中国人民对伊拉克人民的英勇斗争，也就特别充满兄弟般的同情并表示了坚决的支持。我们从心里觉得伊拉克人民的斗争就是我们的斗争；伊拉克人民的胜利就是我们的胜利。
    张奚若说，伊拉克人民的胜利是亚非人民近年来一系列巨大胜利中的又一新的重大胜利。同时，我们看到帝国主义是不甘心他们的失败的。他们妄想以武力挽救他们的失败，派遣军队强占黎巴嫩、约旦，威胁伊拉克，但是现在伊拉克人民已经站起来了，阿拉伯人民的力量比以前更强大了，亚非人民争取独立的斗争，得到全世界人民、特别是社会主义国家人民的支持。美英等殖民主义者定将在民族解放的熊熊怒火之中烧得焦头烂额。
    张奚若最后说，我们相信，通过伊拉克朋友们的访问，将会大大地增强我们两国人民的了解和友谊。将会为我们今后日益增多的友好往来奠定牢固的基础。
    在酒会中间，中国人和伊拉克人就像亲密的朋友那样在一起饮酒交谈，他们为共同的胜利而欢乐，为共同的斗争而表示着彼此坚定的意志。这里没有宾主之分。正如马哈茂德团长所说的：“我们感觉到，我们就是这个国家的主人，以后要离开你们到我们的故乡去，实在是一件困难的事情。”
