Soaring to the World's Peak
    --At the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition

    The industrial palace is magnificent,
    No gods are seen, only heroes,
    Inventions and creations break superstitions,
    The East is reborn as a giant dragon.
    Steel ingots are hard for three people to embrace,
    Like giant fists propping up the sky.
    Machine tools surpass England and America,
    Each a Vajra displaying supernatural powers.
    With aspiration, stars can be plucked from the sky,
    With strength, atomic energy can be subdued,
    Molten iron flows, the three rivers give way,
    The blast furnace lights the sky, the five mountains are startled.
    Six hundred million people follow the east wind,
    Heaven and earth shake,
    Industrialization proceeds at rocket speed,
    Soaring to the world's highest peak.
    Poem by Yuan Shuipai, Photography by Lü Xiangyou
    
    The headquarters of the steel marshal - a relief sculpture from the Metallurgical Industry Hall. It shows that China's industry is spreading its wings and soaring.
    
    This is a "satellite" that will appear in water conservancy and hydropower projects - a model of the Three Gorges Hydropower Station on the Yangtze River. According to preliminary plans, this power station will become the center of China's power grid after completion.
    
    Pushing out the old to bring forth the new, China's dye industry shines brightly. More and more reactive dyes are being made in China. Shanghai alone has successfully trial-produced more than forty types this year. These are the reactive dyes on display and the fabrics dyed with them that never fade.
    
    Heavy equipment is a sign of a country having an independent and strong machinery industry. After the Great Leap Forward in the first half of this year, China has begun to fill the gaps in heavy machinery. The large picture on the left is a medium-sized rolling mill that has already been manufactured. Its roll diameter is 700 mm and it can produce 800,000 tons of steel billets per year. It is two stories high and weighs 150 tons. The small picture on the right is a model of a large primary rolling mill being manufactured in China. Its roll diameter is 1150 mm and it can roll 3.2 million tons of steel billets per year.
    
    The double-sided horizontal combined machine tool manufactured by Dalian Machine Tool Plant is equipped with twenty-four spindles and forty-six tools. Its efficiency is seven to eight times higher than that of ordinary boring machines. This type of machine tool can be used to form automatic production groups and automated workshops.
    
    This is a jet perforating gun manufactured in China for the petroleum industry. Its penetration ability has reached the international level and can penetrate 24 mm thick steel casing and 170 mm thick cement.
    
    A wide variety of plastic products are on display in the Chemical Industry Hall.
    
    Manufacturing cars and tractors is no longer surprising in China. The exhibition displays dozens of types of cars and tractors.
    
    The precision gear grinding machine produced by Shanghai Machine Tool Plant during the Great Leap Forward has reached world-class precision (tooth profile error is on par with the United States and Switzerland, surpassing the United Kingdom; tooth pitch error is on par with the United States, surpassing the United Kingdom and Switzerland). This grinding machine is used to grind high-precision gears, shaving cutters, pinion cutters, and standard gears.
    
    A constant stream of visitors is pouring into the Atomic Energy Hall.
    
    This is an electric spark machining tool manufactured this year by Yingkou Electric Spark Machine Tool Plant. Using electricity to process metal is a new technological method that has developed in the world in recent years.
    
    The industrial electric locomotive successfully manufactured this year by Xiangtan Electric Machinery Plant in Hunan Province is the first electric locomotive successfully manufactured in China.
    
    This is a 1,200-meter petroleum drilling rig.

    飞向世界高峰
    ——在全国工业交通展览会上
    工业殿堂气象宏，
    不见神仙见英雄，
    发明创造破迷信，
    东方新生一巨龙。
    钢锭三人难合抱，
    好比巨拳拄天空。
    车床机械超英美，
    个个金刚显神通。
    有志能摘天上星，
    有力能伏原子能，
    铁水奔流三江避，
    高炉烛天五岳惊。
    六亿人民乖东风，
    天也摇来地也动，
    火箭速度办工业，
    飞向世界最高峰。

    钢帅大本营——冶金馆的浮雕。它显示着我国工业正在展翅高飞。
    这是水利电力工程中将要出现的一颗“卫星”——长江三峡水电站模型。按照初步规划，这个电站建成后将成为我国电力网的中心。
    推陈出新，我国染料工业大放异彩。我国制成的活性染料越来越多，仅上海市今年就试制成功了四十多种。这是展出的活性染料和用它们染出的永不褪色的织品。
    重型设备是一个国家拥有独立、强大机械工业的标志。经过今年上半年的大跃进，我国重型机械方面的空白点开始填补起来了。左边大图是已经制成的中型轧钢机。它的轧辊直径有700公厘，每年可生产80万吨钢坯。它有两层楼高，150吨重。右边小图是我国正在制造中的大型初轧机的模型。它的轧辊直径为1150公厘，每年可以轧制320万吨钢坯。
    大连机床厂制造的双面卧式组合机床，装有二十四个主轴和四十六把刀。效率比一般镗床高七到八倍。用这种机床可以组成自动生产组、自动化车间。
    这是我国制造的石油工业上用的喷射式孔枪。它的射穿能力达到了国际水平，能射穿24公厘厚的钢套管和170公厘厚的水泥。
    在化学工业馆，陈列着花样繁多的塑料产品。
    制造汽车、拖拉机，在我国说已经是不足为奇了，展览会展出了数十种类型的汽车和拖拉机。
    上海机床厂在跃进中生产的精密齿轮磨床，精度赶上世界水平（齿形误差赶上美国和瑞士的，超过英国的；齿距误差赶上美国的，超过英国和瑞士的）。这种磨床是用来磨削高精度齿轮、剃齿刀、插齿刀及标准齿轮等。
    观众川流不息地涌进原子能馆。
    这是营口电火花机床厂今年制成的电火花加工机床。用电加工金属是世界上近年来才发展起来的新工艺方法。
    湖南省湘潭电机厂在今年制造成功的工业用电气机车，它是我国第一次制造成功的电气机车。
    这是一千二百公尺石油钻井机。
