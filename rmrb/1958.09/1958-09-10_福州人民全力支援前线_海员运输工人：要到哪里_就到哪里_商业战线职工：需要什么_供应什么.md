Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 9th: The city of Fuzhou, located on the front lines of coastal defense, saw 250,000 workers, farmers, students, citizens, government employees, and military personnel continue to gather yesterday to support Premier Zhou's statement and oppose the military provocations of U.S. imperialism. Those who attended the rallies expressed with great enthusiasm that they would do everything in their power to support the coastal defense front lines.

Thousands of sailors and stevedores in the Fuzhou shipping system have held multiple protest rallies in recent days. They unanimously stated that they would become the maritime transport vanguards supporting the front lines, guaranteeing ships when needed, people when needed, going wherever they are needed, and ensuring "people are with the ships, transport is smooth, and rain or shine" under any circumstances. All the barge crew members of the Upstream Fleet under the Fuzhou Maritime Affairs Bureau have proposed a new target of "towing more, carrying more, and running more" to transport materials faster and in greater quantities to support production and the front lines.

The vast number of employees in Fuzhou's transportation departments have unanimously expressed their determination to become "steel warriors on the transportation lines supporting the front lines." Automobile drivers at the Fuzhou Automobile Repair Factory have put forward a common slogan: "People do not leave their vehicles, vehicles do not leave their people, go wherever we are needed."

The vast number of employees on the commercial front have also pledged to fulfill the material supply tasks without fail under any circumstances. Employees of the Fuzhou Food and Grocery Company held a pledge rally on the morning of August 8th. All employees guaranteed to supply whatever the front lines need, provide as much as is needed, and deliver whenever it is needed.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 8th: People from all walks of life in Fuzhou warmly support the statement issued by the spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the continuous intrusion of U.S. warships into China's territorial waters.

All the workers at the Fuzhou Repair Factory have joined the militia armed forces today. They firmly stated: If U.S. imperialism dares to provoke a new war, the Chinese people have the full strength to defeat the enemy's provocations.

Zhou Xingzhi, the principal of the Third Middle School in Jiangtou Town, Xiamen City, who suffered multiple casualties among teachers and students on the morning of the 7th due to artillery bombardment by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched on Jinmen Island, after denouncing the crimes of the Chiang bandit troops, protected by U.S. imperialism, in shelling peaceful residents, said that the Third Middle School has now returned to normal classes, and all teachers and students will persist in the struggle to repel the invaders.
