Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd. The First and Second Ministries of Commerce jointly convened a national specialized conference on meat, poultry, eggs, and other products from August 25th to September 2nd. The conference studied and resolved a series of issues in the production and management of meat, poultry, and eggs, and arranged the management plans for the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year. After this arrangement is implemented, the current tight supply of pork, chicken, duck, eggs, and other non-staple foods in some cities and industrial and mining areas will be improved to varying degrees.

The conference reviewed the procurement and supply of live pigs, poultry, eggs, and other commodities in the first half of the year. From January to July, a total of 21 million live pigs were purchased, an increase of 31% compared to the same period last year, and 530 million catties of chicken and duck eggs were purchased, exceeding the total purchase volume of last year. However, it is still far from this year's Great Leap Forward plan. The allocation plan and the export plan for frozen pork were even worse, which seriously affected the completion of the national export plan and the supply of large cities and industrial and mining areas. The conference believes that the main reason for this situation is that the leadership of the commercial departments once inappropriately criticized "purchase, sale, transfer, storage, and profit," and one-sidedly believed that only engaging in industrial production reflects the production viewpoint. This has caused many commercial cadres to neglect procurement and sales work, and even become "uninterested" in procurement and sales. At the same time, some regions lack an overall view and do not seriously implement the national allocation plan, which is also an important reason for the poor completion of the allocation plan.

The conference pointed out that to reverse the current backward situation in the management of meat, poultry, and eggs, we must first attach importance to procurement and sales work ideologically. "Purchase, sale, transfer, storage, and profit (reasonable profit)" are the basic functions of commercial work, which should not only not be criticized but should be strengthened and done well.

The conference pointed out that the fourth quarter is the peak season for meat and poultry eggs, and procurement work must be strengthened. The conference required that all regions must attach great importance to allocation work, seriously and conscientiously implement the national allocation plan, and take all effective measures to resolutely complete the fourth-quarter allocation tasks and export tasks. Inter-provincial cooperation and adjustment can only be carried out on the premise of first ensuring the completion of the national allocation plan.

This conference also discussed the management methods for meat, poultry, and egg commodities in the future. According to the new management methods, the sources of pork, beef, mutton, poultry, and eggs required by Beijing and Shanghai will be arranged uniformly by the central Ministry of Commerce. The Ministry of Commerce will determine the annual and quarterly allocation tasks for each province (autonomous region) based on market needs and the supply situation in urban and rural areas across the country, and each province (region) will guarantee completion. The supply of pork, beef, mutton, poultry, and eggs for domestic sales in each province, except for Liaoning Province, which is currently temporarily assisted by the central Ministry of Commerce by allocating a portion to support it, will be resolved locally in other provinces and generally will not be allocated. Export and military needs will be assigned tasks based on production, and each province and region must guarantee completion.

### 做好购销工作体现生产观点  商业部安排肉食供应

    做好购销工作体现生产观点
　　商业部安排肉食供应
    据新华社3日讯　第一、第二商业部从8月25日到9月2日联合召开全国肉食禽蛋等专业会议，研究和解决了肉食禽蛋生产、经营中的一系列问题，并且安排了今年第四季度和明年第一季度的经营计划。这一安排实现后，目前部分城市、工矿区猪肉、鸡、鸭、蛋等副食品供应紧张的状况，将会得到不同程度的改善。
    会议检查了上半年生猪禽蛋等商品的收购和供应情况，1至7月份共收购生猪二千一百万头，比去年同期增加31％，鸡鸭蛋五亿三千万斤，已超过了去年全年收购量，但与今年的跃进计划比较仍然相差很远。而调拨计划和冻猪肉出口计划则完成的更差，以致严重地影响了国家出口计划的完成和大城市、工矿区的供应。会议认为形成这种状况的主要原因是由于商业部门领导方面曾经一度不适当地批判了“购、销、调、存、赚”，片面地认为只有搞工业生产才是体现生产观点，因此造成不少商业干部忽视购销工作，甚至对购销“不感兴趣”。同时部分地区缺乏整体观念，执行国家调拨计划不够严肃，也是调拨计划完成得不好的重要原因。
    会议指出，要扭转目前肉食禽蛋经营的落后状况，首先必须在思想上重视购销工作。“购、销、调、存、赚（合理的利润）”是商业工作的基本职能，不但不应批判而且应该加强，把它做好。
    会议指出第四季度是肉食、禽蛋的旺季，必须加强收购工作，会议要求各地必须高度重视调拨工作，严肃认真地执行国家调拨计划，要采取一切有效措施，坚决完成第四季度调拨任务和出口任务。省际之间的协作调剂只能在首先保证完成国家调拨计划的前提下进行。
    这次会议还讨论了今后肉食禽蛋商品的管理办法，根据新的管理办法，今后北京、上海两直辖市所需的猪肉、牛肉、羊肉、禽和蛋的货源由中央商业部统一安排，商业部将根据市场需要和全国城乡供应情况确定各省（自治区）年度和季度调拨任务，由各省（区）保证完成。各省内销猪肉、牛肉、羊肉、禽和蛋的供应，除特别困难的辽宁省目前暂由中央商业部规定各省（区）调给一部分支援以外，其余各省均就地解决，一般不作调拨。出口和军需，根据生产情况分配任务，各省、区必须保证完成。
