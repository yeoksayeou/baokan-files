Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: This reporter, Peng Fengye, reports that joyful news of exceeding the livestock breeding plan this year is spreading everywhere on the grasslands of the Mongolian People's Republic. The tasks of handing over livestock products to the state have also been completed in various places. Whether in provincial capitals, county towns, or agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, there is a joyful scene of abundant livestock production everywhere. The Khangai Province originally planned to increase livestock by 38,000 head this year, but according to incomplete statistics in early September, the province can increase by 60,000 head. The Khangai Province increased its livestock by 24,000 head this year, an increase of 7,000 head more than the original plan. The counties and nearly one hundred agricultural and pastoral cooperatives under these two provinces have mostly exceeded their breeding plans.

    The county's livestock count found that the number of livestock increased by more than 1,000 head than originally planned.

    蒙古牲畜兴旺
    超额完成增殖计划
    据新华社讯　本社记者彭逢烨报道：在蒙古人民共和国的草原上到处传播着今年超额完成了牲畜增殖计划的喜讯。各地上缴国家畜产品的任务也都完成了。无论在省会、县城和农牧业合作社，到处一片牲畜丰产的欢欣景象。前杭爱省今年原计划增殖牲畜三万八千头，但是据9月初的不完全统计，全省可增殖六万头。后杭爱省今年增殖了两万四千头牲畜，比原计划多增加了七千头。这两个省所属的各县和近百个农牧业社大都超额完成了增殖计划。
    在前杭爱省戈壁地区的温都尔吉德县，牲畜都很肥壮。
    这个县清点牲畜的结果，发现牲畜数字比原计划多增殖了一千多头。
