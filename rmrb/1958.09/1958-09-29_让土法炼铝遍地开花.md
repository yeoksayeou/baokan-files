Let Indigenous Aluminum Smelting Blossom Everywhere

    In the yard of the Northeast Institute of Technology in Shenyang, there is an alumina plant. This factory is very simple, but it attracts attention from all over the country like a magnet. Visitors come in a continuous stream; letters inquiring about the details are sent from all directions.

    Here, the successful smelting of alumina using indigenous methods provides a new method for全民炼铝 (all-people aluminum smelting). Using this indigenous method to smelt alumina, the equipment is simple, the investment is small, and the construction speed is fast; the power consumption is low, and the fuel consumption is relatively low; and by-products can also be obtained. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently held an on-site meeting on lead smelting experimental work here, summarized this method, and promoted it widely.

    This method was achieved by the teachers and students of the Nonferrous Metals Department of Northeast Institute of Technology, who worked hard for forty days and conducted more than three hundred experiments. Initially, only about 5% of alumina could be extracted. The teachers and students stayed by the furnace day and night, constantly analyzing and improving from aspects such as ingredients, operating methods, light burning time, and temperature, and finally successfully increased the leaching rate to 70%-80%.

    让土法炼铝遍地开花
    在沈阳东北工学院的院子里，有一个氧化铝厂。这个工厂很简单，但它却像磁铁一样，吸引着全国各地的注意。来参观的人川流不息；寻问详细情况的信件，从四面八方投来。
    这里，用土办法炼氧化铝获得成功，为全民炼铝提供了一种新方法。用这种土法炼氧化铝，设备简单，投资少，建设速度快；用电量少，燃料消耗较低；并且还能获得副产品。冶金工业部最近在这里召开了炼铅试验工作现场会议，将这种方法作了总结，广泛推广。
    这种方法是东北工学院有色金属系的师生，苦战四十天，经过三百多次试验，才获得成功的。最初氧化铝只能被提取出5％左右，师生们昼夜守在炉旁，不断地从配料、操作方法、轻烧时间、温度等方面，分析、改进，终于成功地使熔出率达到70％—80％。
