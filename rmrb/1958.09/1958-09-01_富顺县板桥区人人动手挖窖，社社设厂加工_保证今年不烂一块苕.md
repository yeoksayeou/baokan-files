Fushun County, Banqiao District: Everyone digs cellars, every commune sets up factories for processing
Guaranteeing not a single sweet potato rots this year

Editor's Note: The experience of Banqiao District, Fushun County, in handling sweet potatoes deserves the attention of all concentrated sweet potato producing areas. The Banqiao District Committee relied on the masses in this work, informing them of the overall situation of sweet potato production and asking them to come up with ideas and solutions. As a result, a mass movement for storing sweet potatoes was quickly promoted and achieved great results. This year, the national sweet potato planting area is large and the yield is high. In addition to fully meeting the edible needs of urban and rural people, how to do a good job in comprehensive utilization (making starch, alcohol, etc.) is a major task. It is hoped that all localities will mobilize the masses as soon as possible to properly solve it.

Sichuan Daily News: The Luzhou branch of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee's agricultural inspection team found that the experience of the Banqiao District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Fushun, in leading the masses to prepare for the handling of sweet potatoes with a spirit of being both pragmatic and realistic, is worthy of promotion.

This year, the sweet potato output in Banqiao District will reach 1 to 1.5 billion catties, an increase of 25 to 35 times compared to last year. The Banqiao District Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly grasped the new situation of a large increase in sweet potato production, but the storage and processing equipment could not keep up. They mobilized the entire district for a great collaboration between workers, peasants, and merchants to carry out preparations for protecting and using sweet potatoes, guaranteeing that not a single sweet potato would rot this year. The entire district has newly dug more than 12,000 sweet potato cellars in a few days, achieving one to three sweet potato cellars per household. They also plan to dig another 50,000 in the near future, to realize one small cellar per person and one large cellar for every seven people. The people of the entire district have established 218 kang houses (heated brick beds used for drying) using indigenous methods, basically realizing that every team has a kang house. In addition, five sugar workshops, 192 flour mills, and nine larger wineries are being established. The entire district has trial-produced nine kinds of simple processing tools, such as foot-operated double-wheeled sweet potato slicers, which are being vigorously manufactured and promoted. It is estimated that before the sweet potato harvest, there will be a large processing tool for every three households and a small processing tool for every household. The people of the entire district have great confidence in handling sweet potatoes well and are actively realizing the district committee's call for "every commune to have factories, every team to have kang houses, every household to have equipment, and everyone to have a sweet potato cellar."

When the district committee proposed breaking with convention and digging cellars ahead of schedule, some cadres and the masses had various ideological concerns and were slow to act. Township and commune cadres were afraid of affecting production and that the masses would not want to do it, saying things like "We have to eliminate pests and rush to harvest and plant, where is the time to dig cellars?" Some of the masses only knew that there were many sweet potatoes this year, but did not know how many there were, and had a wait-and-see attitude. In view of this situation, the district committee clearly stated that to carry out a nationwide preparation for protecting and using sweet potatoes, it is first necessary to solve ideological problems and to do a good job in political work. Therefore, they organized mass socialist debates. Through extensive airing of views, big debates, and big character posters, the masses recalled the disadvantages of a large number of sweet potatoes rotting in the fields, courtyards, and homes in 1956. That year, the district's sweet potato output was only tens of millions of catties, and each person only needed to store a few hundred catties. This year, the district's sweet potato output will reach more than one billion catties, and each person will have to store at least ten thousand catties. After calculating this detailed account, the masses were shocked and felt that the original equipment was far from enough. They expressed that they would not only dig cellars immediately, but also dig many more.

With the ideological problem solved and the enthusiasm of the masses boosted, agricultural production was extremely busy and labor was very tight. It was necessary to neither delay production nor affect the digging of cellars. The masses discussed and studied, and determined the method of "producing during the day, digging cellars at night; main labor force for production, secondary labor force for digging cellars; digging small cellars separately, and digging large cellars through shock tactics." The main labor force went to the fields for production during the day and dug cellars after meals and in the evening. Children, the elderly, and women took care of housework, cooking and washing clothes, while digging cellars. Each commune extracted three or five people to dig large cellars for storing seeds in the commune through shock tactics for three or two days. Commune members themselves dug small cellars for storing sweet potatoes for their own consumption and completed them on time. In this way, there was no idle land and no idle people in the households, and production and cellar digging did not interfere with each other. At present, the entire district has not only dug more than 12,000 sweet potato cellars, but also done a good job in agricultural production. In addition, the district committee also held meetings with experienced farmers in Liming Eleventh Commune to collect their sweet potato storage experience, so that the masses in the entire district mastered a set of methods and experiences for storing sweet potatoes and digging cellars.

    富顺县板桥区人人动手挖窖，社社设厂加工
　　保证今年不烂一块苕
    编者按　富顺县板桥区处理甘薯的经验，值得一切甘薯集中产区的重视。板桥区委在这个工作中依靠群众办事，把甘薯生产全面情况告诉群众，让群众想办法、出主意，因而迅速促成了贮藏甘薯的群众性运动，收到了很大的效果。今年全国甘薯种植面积大，产量高，除了充分满足城乡人民食用需要以外，怎样作好综合利用（制淀粉、酒精等），是一个很大的工作，希望各地及早发动群众妥善加以解决。
    四川日报消息　四川省委农业检查团泸州分团在富顺检查农业生产时，发现中共板桥区委本着务虚又务实的精神，领导群众作好处理红苕（甘薯）准备工作的经验值得推广。
    板桥区今年红苕产量将达十到十五亿斤，比去年增加二十五倍到三十五倍。中共板桥区委及时抓住红苕产量大增，但是保藏加工设备跟不上的新情况，发动全区工农商大协作，开展了保苕用苕准备工作，保证今年不烂一块苕。全区在几天内就新挖苕窖一万二千多个，已经做到每户有一到三个苕窖。还准备在最近再挖五万个，实现每人一小窖，七人一大窖。全区人民用土办法建立了二百一十八个炕房，基本上实现了队队有炕房。此外，正在建立五个糖坊、一百九十二个粉坊、九个较大的酒厂。全区已经试制出的脚踏双轮切苕机等九种简易加工工具，正在大力制造推广；预计在红苕收获以前，可以做到每三户有一部大型加工工具，每户有一部小型加工工具。全区人民对处理好红苕的信心很足，正在积极实现区委提出“社社有厂坊、队队有炕房、户户有设备、人人有苕窖”的号召。
    区委提出打破常规、提前挖窖的号召时，部分干部和群众存在着各种各样的思想顾虑，行动迟缓。乡、社干部怕影响生产，怕群众不想干，说什么“要除虫、要抢收抢种，那有时间去挖窖”。有的群众只知道今年红苕多，到底有多少不知道，存在慢慢来的思想。区委根据这种情况，明确提出：要开展全民性的保苕用苕准备工作，首先必须解决思想问题，必须认真做好政治工作。于是组织了群众性的社会主义大辩论。通过大鸣大放，大争大辩，群众回忆了1956年大批红苕烂在田里、院里、家里的坏处，那年这区红苕产量只有几千万斤，每人只要保管几百斤；今年全区红苕产量达十几亿斤，每人至少要保管万斤以上。算了这笔细账，群众才大吃一惊，感到原有设备很不够，纷纷表示不仅要立即挖窖，而且要多多挖窖。
    思想问题解决了，群众的干劲鼓足了，但是农业生产极忙，劳动力十分紧张，既不能耽误生产，又不能影响挖窖。群众讨论研究，确定了“白天生产，晚上挖窖；主要劳动力生产，次要劳动力挖窖；分散挖小窖，突击挖大窖”的办法。主要劳动力白天下地生产，饭后和晚间挖窖；小孩、老年人、妇女一边料理家务，煮饭洗衣，一边挖窖。每社抽出三、五人，突击三、两天挖社里贮藏种子的大窖，社员自己挖留存食用苕的小窖，定时完成，这样就作到地无闲土、家无闲人，生产挖窖两不误。目前全区不仅挖成了一万二千多个苕窖，而且农业生产搞得很好。此外，区委还在黎明十一社召开了老农会议，搜集他们的保苕经验，使全区群众掌握了一套藏苕、挖窖的方法和经验。
