Xinhua News Agency, September 4th -- According to TASS, Tokyo, September 3rd: The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 3rd, calling on the Japanese people to resolutely oppose the United States' military provocations in the Taiwan Strait and defend peace in the Far East.

The statement said that the U.S. imperialists' aggressive adventures in the Middle East have just been defeated, and now they are carrying out new military provocations in the Far East. The statement pointed out that this kind of provocation by the United States against the People's China contains the danger of a world war breaking out. The statement warned that Japan might be dragged into the military plans of the U.S. imperialists.

The statement pointed out that the Japanese bourgeois newspapers, encouraged by the anti-China policies of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, are echoing American propaganda while also stirring up nationalistic sentiment. This approach cannot promote the cause of ensuring peace in the Far East.

The statement said that the Japanese Communist Party reminds the Japanese people to pay attention to the seriousness of the current situation and calls on the people to unite to defend peace.

The statement demanded that the United States stop interfering in China's internal affairs and withdraw all troops from Taiwan. The statement protested the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China. The statement said that the Japanese Communist Party supports the just struggle of the Chinese people who are full of confidence in liberating Taiwan. The statement pointed out that Japan must restore diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China as soon as possible, develop trade, and establish friendly ties.

Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd, Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Peace Committee issued a statement on the 2nd, demanding that the United States immediately cease its armed provocations in the Taiwan Strait.

The statement strongly opposed the Kishi Nobusuke government's provision of military bases in mainland Japan and Okinawa to the U.S. military. The statement pointed out that this action by the Kishi Nobusuke government has fueled the armed provocations carried out by the United States in the Taiwan area.

The statement strongly demanded that the United States withdraw its Seventh Fleet and all American troops from Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, and demanded that the Japanese government sever relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique that is doing evil in the Far East, and establish peaceful and friendly diplomatic relations with the 600 million Chinese people and restore Sino-Japanese trade relations.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, September 3rd: Former Japanese Prime Minister and Socialist Party advisor Tetsu Katayama, when talking to Hungarian reporters about the Taiwan Strait situation, said that the issue of Jinmen (Quemoy) and other islands is China's internal affair.

Tetsu Katayama said that today Japan's exports and imports are completely unbalanced. Because Japan imports from the distant United States, the price of goods is very expensive. If Japan can obtain imports from China, this means that we can buy what Japan needs more cheaply, and at the same time, we can increase export trade.

    日本共产党和和平委员会发表声明
　　反对岸政府当美国的帮凶
    前首相片山哲说解决金门等岛问题是中国内政
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社东京3日讯：日本共产党中央委员会干部会在3日发表声明，号召日本人民坚决反对美国在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅，捍卫远东的和平。
    声明说，美帝国主义者在中东的侵略冒险刚刚遭到失败，现在又在远东进行新的军事挑衅。声明指出，美国对人民中国的这种挑衅包藏着爆发世界大战的危险。声明警告说，日本可能被拖入美帝国主义者的军事计划中去。
    声明指出，日本资产阶级报刊在敌视中国的岸信介内阁政策的怂恿下，一面附和美国的宣传，同时还煽动民族情绪，这种做法是不能促进确保远东的和平事业的。
    声明说，日本共产党提醒日本人民要注意目前局势的严重性，并且号召人民联合起来，保卫和平。
    声明要求美国停止对中国内政的干涉，并且把军队全部撤出台湾。声明抗议岸信介政府执行敌视中国的政策。声明说，日本共产党支持满怀解放台湾信心的中国人民的正义斗争。声明指出，日本必须尽快地同中华人民共和国恢复外交关系，发展贸易和建立友好联系。
    据新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本和平委员会在2日发表声明，要求美国立即停止在台湾海峡进行的武装挑衅。
    声明强烈反对岸信介政府向美军提供设在日本内地和冲绳的军事基地。声明指出，岸信介政府的这种做法助长了美国在台湾一带进行的武装挑衅。
    声明强烈要求美国从台湾、日本、南朝鲜撤出它的第七舰队和所有的美国军队，要求日本政府同在远东为非作歹的蒋介石集团断绝关系，并且同六亿中国人民建立和平友好的外交关系和恢复日中贸易关系。
    据新华社布达佩斯3日电　日本前首相、社会党顾问片山哲在对匈牙利记者谈到台湾海峡局势时说，金门等岛屿问题是中国的内政问题。
    片山哲说，今天日本的出口和进口完全不平衡。因为，日本从遥远的美国进口，商品价格很贵。如果日本能从中国获得进口，这就意味着我们可以较便宜地购买日本所需要的东西，同时还可以增加出口贸易。
