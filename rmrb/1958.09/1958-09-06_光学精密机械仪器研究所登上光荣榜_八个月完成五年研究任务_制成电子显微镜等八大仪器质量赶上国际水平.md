Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, September 5th: The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Optical Precision Machinery Instrument Research Institute, after eight months of arduous work, has basically completed the research tasks stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan.

As of the end of August, the institute had successively completed the trial production of eight major instruments. These eight instruments are: electron microscope, high-temperature microscope, universal tool microscope, multi-magnification projector, large spectrograph, crystal spectrometer, high-precision theodolite, and photoelectric rangefinder. It also successfully trial-produced a series of new optical glass varieties such as movie camera lenses, photographic lenses, crystallized glass, and photon counting tubes. These research efforts are the highest targets stipulated by the research institute in the Second Five-Year Plan, which was revised at the beginning of this year.

The successful research of these eight major instruments is of extreme importance to China's technological and cultural revolution. The electromagnetic electron microscope has a very wide range of applications and is an indispensable tool for research work in physics, metallurgy, medicine, and organic chemistry polymers. Large spectrographs are the main tools for spectral analysis in modern industry and scientific research. Using spectral analysis methods, precise conclusions can be drawn on the analysis of the chemical composition of metal smelting, alloy manufacturing, and minerals. The universal tool microscope is a high-precision measuring instrument and an essential instrument for the mechanical industry. The light-speed rangefinder is a new type of geodetic surveying instrument, and the high-temperature microscope is an indispensable tool for the development of the metallurgical industry.

After appraisal, the quality of these eight instruments has reached or exceeded the level of similar products internationally. Their successful trial production indicates that China has entered the international advanced ranks in the research of optical precision machinery instruments.

The emergence of such a great leap forward situation in the Optical Precision Machinery Instrument Research Institute is inseparable from the institute's Party organization leading the masses in constantly struggling against conservative thinking and individualism. Some people were superstitious about foreign countries and believed that instruments that took foreign countries many years to make could not be made by us in a year and a half, saying that making them in two or three months was a "myth." When young scientific and technical personnel boldly put forward active suggestions, some people poured cold water on them, calling it "nonsense." However, the institute's Party organization resolutely supported the enthusiasm of the masses, organized mass debates, compared progress, compared drive, and organized everyone to collectively study plans and collectively design, resulting in continuous miracles.

In addition to leveraging the role of veteran researchers, the Party organization paid special attention to leveraging the enthusiasm of young researchers and workers. Implementing communist collaboration is also an important factor in the institute's outstanding achievements in the Great Leap Forward. In the trial production of the eight major instruments, not only did the various departments within the institute cooperate well, but also received support and assistance from many brother units.

To celebrate this achievement, the Optical Precision Machinery Instrument Research Institute held a celebration on the 1st. Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Vice Presidents Zhang Jingfu and Wu Youxun, and Fu Zhensheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the celebration. They warmly praised the great achievements of China's optical field and encouraged all employees of the institute to continue their efforts, further launch a mass-based and greater leap forward upsurge, and make greater contributions to socialism.

　　光学精密机械仪器研究所登上光荣榜
　　八个月完成五年研究任务
　　制成电子显微镜等八大仪器质量赶上国际水平
    据新华社长春5日电　中国科学院光学精密机械仪器研究所经过八个月的苦战，已经基本完成了第二个五年计划所规定的研究任务。
    到8月底为止，这个研究所已先后完成了八大仪器的试制工作。这八种仪器是：电子显微镜、高温显微镜、万能工具显微镜、多倍投影仪、大型光谱仪、晶体谱仪、高精度经纬仪、光电测距仪，同时还试制成功电影摄影机镜头、照相镜头、结晶玻璃和光子计数管等一系列新品种光学玻璃。这些研究工作是研究所在今年年初修订的第二个五年计划中规定的最高指标。
    这八大仪器的研究成功，对于我国的技术革命和文化革命具有极重要的作用。电磁式电子显微镜的应用范围非常广泛，是物理学、冶金、医学和有机化学高分子等研究工作所不可缺少的工具。大型光谱仪是现代工业和科学研究上进行光谱分析的主要工具。利用光谱分析法，可以对金属冶炼、合金制造和矿物的化学成分的分析，得出精确结论。万能工具显微镜是一种高精度的计量仪器，是机械工业必备的重要仪器。光速测距仪是一种新型的大地测量仪器，高温显微镜是发展冶金工业不可少的工具。
    这八大仪器经过鉴定，其质量都已达到或超过国际同类产品的水平。它们的试制成功，表明我国在光学精密机械仪器研究方面已经进入国际先进行列。
    光学精密机械仪器研究所出现了这样大跃进局面，是同研究所的党组织领导群众不断同保守思想、个人主义作斗争分不开的。有些人迷信外国，认为外国要多少年做出来的仪器，我们不可能在一年半载做出来，说两三个月就做出来那是“神话”。当青年科学技术人员大胆提出积极的建议时，有的人却泼冷水，说是“胡闹”。但是研究所党组织坚决支持群众的积极性，组织群众辩论，比先进，比干劲，组织大家集体研究计划，集体设计，结果奇迹不断出现。
    党组织除了发挥老研究人员的作用以外，特别注意发挥青年研究人员和工人的积极性。实行共产主义大协作也是这个研究所在大跃进中取得优异成绩的重要因素之一。在试制八大仪器中，不仅所内各部协作得好，而且也得到了很多兄弟单位的支持和协助。
    为了庆祝这一成就，光学精密机械仪器研究所在1日举行了庆祝会，中国科学院院长郭沫若，副院长张劲夫、吴有训，中共吉林省委书记处书记富振声都出席了这个庆祝会。他们热烈称赞我国光学领域的伟大成就，并勉励这个研究所的全体职工继续努力，进一步掀起群众性的更大的跃进高潮，为社会主义作出更大的贡献。
