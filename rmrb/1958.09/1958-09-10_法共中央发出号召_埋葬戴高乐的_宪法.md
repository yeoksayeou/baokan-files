Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 8th: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a meeting in Gennevilliers on September 6th. The meeting heard a report by Jacques Duclos on the political situation and the Party's tasks in the "referendum" struggle. After discussion, the meeting adopted Duclos's report and a resolution.

The resolution pointed out: The movement against De Gaulle's constitution and policies is gaining momentum. An increasing number of parliamentarians and prominent figures of various tendencies, including Socialists, Radicals, and Catholics, have expressed opposition to De Gaulle's constitution and policies; this demonstrates a growing resistance to dictatorship.

The resolution emphasized that voting "no" means breaking with a past of persecution that the whole country can no longer tolerate. Voting "no" also means avoiding civil war. Voting "no" is to ensure the victory of all Republicans.

The resolution called on all Communists to carry out explanatory work to make people understand the true nature of De Gaulle's policies and constitution, and called on them to redouble their efforts to achieve a united front with the Socialists, and to strive to unite democratic forces in the Republic Committees at all levels, in enterprises, urban areas, villages, and mass organizations, so that Socialists, Communists, Radicals, Catholics, and all Republicans can act in unison.

    法共中央发出号召
　　埋葬戴高乐的“宪法”
    据新华社巴黎8日电　法国共产党中央委员会9月6日在日尼维埃举行了会议。会议听取了雅克·杜克洛关于政治形势和在“公民投票”斗争中党的任务的报告，并且在经过讨论之后，通过了杜克洛的报告和一项决议。
    决议指出：反对戴高乐的宪法和政策的运动声势日益壮大。越来越多的议员和各种倾向的著名人士，其中有社会党人、激进党人和天主教徒，表示反对戴高乐的宪法和政策；这表明了对独裁统治的日益强大的反抗。
    决议强调说，投反对票就是表明同全国所不能再忍受的带来迫害的过去决裂。投反对票也就是意味着避免内战。投反对票就是为了确保所有共和人士取得胜利。
    决议号召全体共产党人进行解释工作来使人们明了戴高乐的政策和宪法的真正性质，号召他们加倍努力争取同社会党人实现统一战线，努力在各地保卫共和国委员会中、在企业、市区、乡村和群众团体中团结民主力量，以便使社会党人、共产党人、激进党人、天主教徒和所有共和人士一致行动。
