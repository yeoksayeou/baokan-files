A Newest and Most Beautiful Picture

The people of all ethnic groups in Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, are working with soaring enthusiasm. This year, they planted rice on a large scale in the high and cold mountains for the first time. The average yield of early rice exceeded 813 jin per mu, achieving a bumper harvest unprecedented in history. Now, in this county, every village is adorned with colorful arches celebrating the harvest, every village is building more warehouses, and every household is spreading news of new people and new events in the Great Leap Forward.

In the Chengyang Agricultural Cooperative, at 4:00 AM every day, a loud voice is regularly broadcast from Mount Wuyia, which stands in the center of the village. As soon as the cooperative members hear the call from the mountaintop broadcaster, Yang Zhiyuan, they rush out of the village. Yang Zhiyuan is a 26-year-old Communist Party member. When the production high tide formed last winter, he asked the Party branch to approve him as a broadcaster to control working hours. The Party branch agreed to this request. From then on, he moved alone to the top of Mount Wuyia, living in a shed made of old tarpaulins, sticking to his post, without interruption for eight months. On January 18th this year, after four days and four nights of heavy snow, he was trapped on the mountaintop, lacking both water and food, but he did not come down the mountain. Instead, his broadcast voice became even louder. During the day, he called on the cooperative members to overcome the ice and snow, vigorously accumulate fertilizer, and strive for increased production. At night, he lit a bonfire and cleared wasteland by sweeping away the snow. When thirsty or hungry, he boiled snow water to drink.

Late at night on April 21st, a whirlwind mixed with thunder and lightning, and a sudden rain of hailstones came down. Yang Zhiyuan's shed was blown away. Without considering the danger of electric shock, he picked up the broadcasting horn and shouted loudly, mobilizing the cooperative members to salvage the timber in the river that was about to be washed away by the flood. He thought that the newly built Jichang Reservoir in the cooperative still had leaks. If it were to be breached by the flash flood, sixty mu of early rice below would be turned into a sandbar. He immediately took advantage of the lightning, braved the heavy rain, climbed down the fifty-zhang-high Mount Wuyia, and rushed to the reservoir with the militia captain, Yang Fuxiang. They jumped into the water, swam, dove, surfaced, and dove again, fighting hard until 8:00 AM the next morning, plugging six holes in a row, protecting the reservoir, and saving the rice fields. On another occasion, a culvert in the Huchong Reservoir was leaking due to rain, and the stones at the entrance of the hole had begun to collapse. Yang Zhiyuan disregarded people's advice, took an oil lamp, and crawled into the culvert to find the leak. Because there was a lack of oxygen in the culvert, the oil lamp quickly went out. He immediately came out, took a flashlight, and crawled in again, crawling sixteen zhang into the cave before finding the breach. Rescuing the reservoir was not originally the duty of the broadcaster, but Yang Zhiyuan said, "A Communist Party member should do everything. Otherwise, what Great Leap Forward are we talking about? What about striving for a good harvest?" Before the early rice harvest, he was named an outstanding Party member of the entire cooperative. At the cooperative members' meeting, he raised his hand and swore to the Party: "As long as I am here, the broadcasting voice will never stop; if the rice yield per mu does not reach twenty thousand jin, Yang Zhiyuan will not leave Mount Wuyia."

Men No Longer "Sit with Sisters," Women No Longer "Bleach Themselves"

In the past, young Dong men and women commonly had the habit of "sitting with sisters" (courting). If they missed one night, they felt listless, as if they had not eaten for several days. In particular, young women, a month before getting married, transplanting rice, or harvesting rice, had to wrap their faces, legs, and arms with tung leaves and fine cloth to "bleach themselves" at home, making their skin tender and white to win the admiration of young men. Every year during the third day of the third lunar month, the sixth day of the sixth lunar month, and the Mid-Autumn Festival in the eighth lunar month, young men and women from various villages would gather in the drum tower to play the reed pipe, play the lute, sing mountain songs, and revel for several days. This wasted a lot of working time. During this year's Great Leap Forward in production, villages and hamlets fought day and night, and young people took the initiative to change these customs. Many young men and women swore at production mobilization meetings that the first thing they would guarantee was to not "sit with sisters" or "bleach themselves," actively participate in labor, and overfulfill the production increase targets. In the Chengyang Agricultural Cooperative, young people used to have three comparisons: comparing who "sat" with more girls, comparing who dressed better, and comparing who ate better. Now, there are new three comparisons: comparing who has better ideology, who labors better, and who studies better. The young men worked day and night, persisting for more than eight months. The young women were tanned red and black from labor, and no one could be found sitting at home "bleaching themselves" anymore. Almost all of the forty-one newly married young couples in the cooperative established deep love in the movement of building water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer. Among them, thirty-six couples went to work on the same day they got married. Young Communist League members Wu Mingnv and Yang Wenyin lived on the construction site with the male cooperative members after their marriage, actively participating in fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy construction, rice transplanting and harvesting, and also took the lead in taming cattle and using double-wheeled double-blade plows to cultivate the land. Some old-fashioned elders ridiculed them as "wild girls," but they said: As long as we can win a great harvest of grain and turn poor mountain areas into rich mountain areas, that is great civilization.

Cutting Off the "Dragon Veins" and Liberating the Land

In the past, in areas inhabited by the Dong and Yao ethnic groups, belief in feng shui and "dragon veins" was very common. Any feng shui land could not only not be disturbed, but even aquatic plants could not be touched. Therefore, much fertile land was barren for a long time, and living water became dead water. After the publicity and education of the socialist general line, people no longer believed in these old rules and customs. In the movement to build water conservancy projects and accumulate fertilizer, the people of all ethnic groups cut off a total of seven famous "dragon veins," moved 1,540 tomb mountains, and liberated a large area of land. In the Bajing District, there was a feng shui ridge. The District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party drew a water pipe from here to the organ two years ago, and it was secretly cut off by the masses that night. Many people said that the cadres had destroyed the "dragon veins," and grain production would be greatly reduced. This spring, when water conservancy projects were being built here, a mass debate was launched. A Dong female activist said: "What feng shui tomb mountains are you talking about? It's all a lie. The landlord class talked about good feng shui and good fate, and they had food and clothing. Haven't they been overthrown by the people now? Whoever doesn't work will go hungry and freeze." In this way, the activists refuted the "feng shui theory" and the "fatalism" like thunder and lightning. Under the slogan of "Everything for socialism, everything for the thousand-jin cooperative," the vast number of cooperative members worked together to excavate the soil, move the graves, and build a twenty-li-long canal. The stream passed through three villages and irrigated thousands of mu of fields. Now, the early rice has achieved a great harvest. The grains in the fields have not yet been harvested, and the warehouses in the villages are already full. People are simply building a batch of warehouses in the fields and at the foot of the mountains, all smiling happily.

Dazhu Cooperative Members Suffer from "Singing Madness"

"The rice ears in the field are golden, the gentle breeze blows fragrantly, we harvest and sing, never forgetting the Communist Party." This is the song floating over the fields of the Dazhu Cooperative. The cooperative members have composed more than 210,000 mountain songs in the past six months, especially the women, who sing constantly when going to work, leaving work, attending meetings, and walking. People who visit this cooperative all say that the cooperative members have "singing madness." Cooperative members who love to sing and make noise are called "Ten Thousand Years of Joy" and "Birds on the Tree." As long as there are three people together, there is no end to singing and laughter. In the past, daughters-in-law never sang in front of their fathers-in-law, but now there are several households in the village where the father-in-law composes the song, the daughter-in-law sings it, and the whole family sings it. Cao Jiankun's wife is already over fifty years old, and as soon as she hears someone singing, she joins in. This elderly woman was not like this before. When she first joined the cooperative two years ago, she always felt that she was not free in the cooperative and often planned to withdraw. The cooperative members plowed her fields and used her plows. As soon as she saw it, she cursed. How could she have the interest to sing? Last year, her income began to increase, and she paid off her debts before joining the cooperative. She began to sing occasionally. This year, the cooperative has achieved a great harvest, and everyone's hearts are blooming, so she couldn't help but let go of her voice and sing heartily.

In the Great Leap Forward in production, a group of "elderly promoting factions" has emerged in various places. These "old youths," who are not bound by conservative ideas and dare to think and act like young people, number more than 80 in the Chengyang Agricultural Cooperative. In mid-May this year, the cooperative convened a Party and League member meeting to revise the production increase targets. Shi Hanyao, 74, and Wu Jiasheng, 53, and a dozen other elderly people were invited to participate in the meeting. In order to express their determination to leap forward, the elderly people followed the most solemn Dong customs, drank blood wine in public, and swore before Chairman Mao's portrait: Strive to increase the yield of rice per mu to more than 1,600 jin, and ensure that their production enthusiasm does not fall behind the youth. During the construction of water conservancy projects, Wu Jiasheng was the first to climb "feng shui land" Carp Slope with the Party branch secretary to dig soil and cut trees, taking the lead in breaking superstitions. During the summer fertilizer accumulation and rush harvesting and planting movements, these elderly people often worked at night, lived on the mountains, and ate in the fields. Some young people advised them to finish work earlier and rest more, but Wu Jiasheng and Chen Qifa, 63, sang a mountain song: "Chengyang's old people compete with Huang Zhong, every household takes the lead in production, the deeper the night, the more energetic they become, the older the watermelon, the redder the heart," and refused to withdraw their troops even in the middle of the night. In late July, the elderly people saw the unprecedented great harvest of early rice with their own eyes, and their enthusiasm became even more soaring. Wu Chengxian and Wu Chengxiu, brothers in their sixties, led six neighbors over the age of fifty to form an "elderly commando team" to open up one mu of late rice experimental field, apply 10,000 dan of fertilizer, and densely plant 60,000 seedlings, launching a competition with the young cooperative members. They demanded a yield of 20,000 jin per mu, striving for the opportunity to go to Beijing with the young people to participate in the "Youth Celebration Meeting."

　　一幅最新最美的图画
    广西僮族自治区三江侗族自治县的各族人民干劲冲天，今年在高寒山岭上头一次大面积种稻，十万多亩早稻平均亩产八百一十三斤，获得了有史以来的大丰收。现在，这个县村村结扎喜庆丰收的彩门，寨寨增建仓库，家家户户传颂着大跃进中的新人新事。
    在程阳农业社，每日凌晨四时，从矗立在村寨中心的雾牙山上照例传送出一阵宏亮的声音。社员们一听到山顶广播员杨志元的呼唤，就争先恐后地走出了山寨。杨志元是个二十六岁的共产党员，去年冬季生产高潮形成时，他请求党支部批准自己做广播员，来掌握劳动时间。党支部答应了这个请求，从那时起，他就单身搬上雾牙山顶，住在一张用旧船篷搭盖成的棚子里，坚守岗位，八个月来未曾一日间断。今年1月18日，一连落了四天四夜大雪，他被围困在山顶上，既缺水又断粮，但他没有下山，广播声音反而更加嘹亮。白天他号召社员们战胜冰雪严寒，大力积肥，力争增产；晚上便点起篝火，扫雪开荒。渴了饥了，就煮些雪水下肚。
    4月21日深夜，旋风雷电交加，骤雨冰雹齐下，杨志元的棚子都被卷走了。他没有考虑自己有无触电危险，拿起广播筒便大声呼喊，动员社员起来打捞河里快要被洪水冲走的木材。他想到社里新修起的吉昌水库还有漏洞，如果被山洪冲垮，下面六十亩早稻全要变成沙滩，马上趁着闪电，顶着急雨爬下五十丈高的雾牙山，和民兵队长杨富祥一起奔往水库。他们跳下水里游着，钻下去，浮上来，又潜进去，苦战到次晨八点钟，一连堵塞了六个洞眼，保住水库，抢救了稻田。另一次，虎冲水库一个涵管因雨漏水，洞口石块已开始塌陷，杨志元不顾人们的劝阻，提盏油灯就钻进涵洞里，寻找漏洞。因涵管内缺少氧气，油灯很快息灭了，他马上退出来拿着手电筒又钻进去，在洞里一直爬了十六丈远才找到破口。抢救水库，本来不是广播员的职务，但杨志元说：“一个共产党员什么事都应该干，不这样还谈什么大跃进，说什么争取丰收。”早稻收割前，他被评选为全社的优秀党员。在社员大会上，他举手向党宣誓：“有我在，广播声音永远不断；水稻亩产不达双万斤，杨志元不下雾牙山”。
    男不“坐妹”女不“沤白”
    侗族青年男女过去普遍有“坐妹”（谈情说爱）习惯，如有一晚间断，便像几天没有吃饭似的，无精打彩。尤其是女青年在结婚、插秧、割禾前一个月，都要用桐叶和细布将脸、腿、手臂包扎起来，在家里“沤白”，使皮肤沤得又嫩又白，好赢得小伙子们的爱慕。每逢夏历三月三、六月六、八月中秋，各村青年男女还要聚集在鼓楼里，吹芦笙，弹琵琶，对唱山歌，狂欢几天。这不知耽误了多少劳动时间。今年生产大跃进中，村村寨寨日夜苦战，青年们主动改变了这些风俗习惯。许多青年男女在生产誓师大会上宣誓时，头一条就是保证不“坐妹”、不“沤白”，积极劳动，超额完成增产任务。程阳农业社的青年过去有三比，就是：比谁“坐”的姑娘多，比谁穿得好，比谁吃得好；现在出现了新三比：比思想好、劳动好和学习好。男青年们日夜出工，一直坚持了八个多月；女青年们在劳动中晒得又红又黑，再也找不到一个坐在家里“沤白”的了。全社四十一对新婚青年夫妇，差不多都是在修水利、积肥运动中，建立了深厚的爱情；其中有三十六对当天结婚当天都出了工。女共青团员吴明女和杨文英，结婚后和男社员一起住在工地上，积极参加积肥、修水利、插秧割禾，还带头驯牛，使用双轮双铧犁耕田。有个别旧脑筋的老年人讽刺她们是“野姑娘”，她们说：只要能争得粮食大丰收，把穷山区变成富山区，就是大大的文明。
    斩断“龙脉”解放土地
    过去，在侗、瑶族聚居地区，信风水、讲“龙脉”十分普遍，凡是风水地段，不仅不能破土，连水草也不能触动，因此，许多肥沃土地长期荒废，活水变成了死水。经过社会主义总路线的宣传教育，人们不信这一套陈规旧俗了。在兴修水利和积肥运动中，各族人民总共斩断七处有名的“龙脉”，迁移了一千五百四十个坟山，解放了大片土地。八江区有一座风水岭，前年中共区委会从这里引架一条水管到机关里，当夜就被群众偷偷砍掉，很多人都说干部破坏了“龙脉”，粮食要大大减产。今年春天，这里兴修水利时，开展了一次全民大辩论。一个侗族妇女积极分子说：“讲什么风水坟山？全是哄人。地主阶级讲风水好、命好，有吃有穿，现在不是被人民推翻了？谁不劳动，谁就挨饥受冻。”就是这样，积极分子们霹雷闪电地驳倒了
  “风水论”和“宿命论”。广大社员在“一切为了社会主义、一切为了千斤社”的口号下，齐心协力开土迁坟，修起了一条二十里长的水渠，溪流穿过三个村寨，灌田数千亩。现在，早稻获得了大丰收，田野里的谷子还没有打完，村寨里的仓库已经装满，人们索性在田间、在山脚下兴建一批仓库，个个喜笑颜开。
    大竹社员患“歌疯”
    “田中稻穗片片黄，和风吹来喷喷香，一边收割一边唱，世代不忘共产党”。这是飘荡在大竹社田野上的歌声。这个社的社员半年来编唱的山歌，多至二十一万多首，尤其是妇女，出工、收工、开会、走路都是歌不离口。到这个社参观的人们，个个都说社员们“患了歌疯”。爱唱爱闹的社员被称为“万年欢”和“树上鸟”，只要有三个人一起，歌唱声和欢笑声就没有个完。过去儿媳妇在家公面前从来不唱歌，现在村子里有好几户是家公编歌、儿媳妇唱，儿媳妇唱完全家唱。曹建坤的妻子已经五十多岁了，只要听到有人唱歌，便凑上去合唱。这个老年妇女以前并不是这样，前年她刚入社时，总感觉社里不自由，经常打算退社。社员们犁她的田，用她的犁，她一看见就骂，那有兴致唱歌。去年她的收入开始增加，还清了入社前的债务，她开始间或唱几次歌。今年社里获得了大丰收，人人心花怒放，她也禁不住放开喉咙纵情地歌唱起来了。
    生产大跃进中，各地还涌现出一批“老人促进派”。这些不受保守思想束缚和青年人一样敢想敢为的“老青年”，在程阳农业社里就有八十多人。今年5月中旬，社里召开党、团员大会，修订增产指标，七十四岁的石汉尧和五十三岁的吴家盛等十几位老人被邀请参加了会议。为了表示跃进决心，老人们沿用侗族最庄严的风习，当众饮下血酒，并在毛主席像前宣誓：力争每亩水稻产量超过一千六百斤，保证生产干劲不落青年之后。大修水利时，吴家盛头一个跟党支部书记一起，登上“风水地”鲤鱼坡挖土砍树，带头破除迷信。在夏季积肥和抢收抢种运动中，这些老年人经常出夜工，住在山上，吃在田头。一些青年人劝他们早些收工，多休息会儿，吴家盛和六十三岁的陈启发便顺口唱了一首山歌：“程阳老人赛黄忠，门门生产打先锋，越干夜深越有劲，西瓜越老心越红”，半夜三更也不肯收兵。7月下旬，老人们亲眼看到早稻空前大丰收，干劲更加冲天。六十多岁的吴成贤、吴成修兄弟，带动邻舍六个五十岁以上的老人，组成了一个“老年突击组”，开辟一亩晚稻试验田，施放肥料一万担，密植秧苗六万蔸，和青年社员开展竞赛。他们要求亩产两万斤，争取机会和青年人一道上北京参加“青年庆功会。”
