    Blower

    The blower is an important machine in metallurgical equipment. In the iron-making process of blast furnaces, a large amount of air needs to be sent in to make the coke inside the furnace burn, so as to rapidly melt the iron ore. Generally, a small blast furnace needs an air volume of about three to five times the volume of the blast furnace per minute. The coke, iron ore, limestone, etc. inside the blast furnace have a certain resistance to air. A certain pressure is required when blowing air to send it in. Generally, the greater the air volume, the more iron is produced; if the air pressure is too low, the blast furnace will freeze and molten iron will not come out. Small blast furnaces with different volumes require blowers with different air volumes and pressures. Its function is like a human lung, and the large amount of oxygen needed for steelmaking is entirely supplied by it.

    鼓风机
    鼓风机是冶金设备中的一种重要机械。高炉炼铁过程中，为了使铁矿石迅速熔化，需要送进大量空气，使炉内的焦炭燃烧。一般小高炉每分钟需要的风量约为高炉容积的三到五倍。高炉内部的焦炭、铁矿石、石灰石等对空气有一定的阻力，送风时必须有一定的压力才能送进去。一般情况，风量愈大，出铁愈多；风压过低就会使高炉冻结，出不来铁水。不同容积的小高炉就需要不同风量和风压的鼓风机。它的作用就像人的肺一样，炼钢时需要的大量氧气完全由它来供给。
