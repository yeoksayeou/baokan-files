To prepare blast furnaces for winter early, Sichuan Province is rushing to stockpile ore and fuel. Laiyuan County completes half-year mining task.

Chongqing, September 28th (this newspaper) - Sichuan Province's nine million iron and steel workers are focusing on the construction of furnaces while vigorously engaging in the extraction and preparation of ore, fuel, and other materials, ensuring that the province's daily pig iron production level can soon be stabilized at around 15,000 tons and gradually increased. As of the 25th, the province's ore inventory has reached over 700,000 tons, and the inventory of coke and charcoal has reached 147,000 tons.

Counties like Kai, Da, and Qijiang, striving for a daily output of 1,000 tons of pig iron, have concentrated more than two-thirds of their workforce on the iron and steel front to focus on the preparation of ore, fuel, and other materials. In the iron mines of Da County, 120,000 workers have gathered to intensify mining, tree felling, charcoal burning, and transportation. Currently, over 2,400 mine tunnels are under construction, and over 1,500 have already produced ore. A large amount of ore and fuel is being supplied to the county's 3,000+ blast furnaces. As of September 22nd, Jiangjin Prefecture had excavated over 2,000 mine shafts and over 100 open-pit mines, extracting over 100,000 tons of ore; the ore needed for iron smelting in the district in September has been completely resolved, and they are currently vigorously stockpiling ore for October. Of the one million+ iron and steel workers in Wanxian Prefecture, 70% are responsible for ore and fuel extraction and transportation; prior to the 25th, they had collected 100,000 tons of ore. Da County Prefecture has also launched a high tide of building kilns to produce coke. In September, the people of Fushun County built 150 coke kilns, which will produce 30,000 tons of coke and coal this month. (Ming Jun)

According to the Hebei Daily, the mining army of 15,000 people in Laiyuan County, Hebei Province, after ten days and nights of hard work, has initially achieved a great mining harvest. By September 16, the county had mined a total of 73,231 tons of iron ore, exceeding the second half of the year's mining task by 13,231 tons, providing abundant ore for the county to complete its iron smelting task.

In order to prepare sufficient grain for the blast furnaces, the Laiyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, while mobilizing the masses to build furnaces and smelt iron, mobilized more than 15,000 people to form a mining army, led by several hundred county, township, and commune cadres, to set up camps on the mountains at 35 mining sites, launching a mining assault. The mining army implemented military organization, forming 13 combat corps and 35 combat battalions (including three women's independent battalions). In order to solve the problem of insufficient mining tools, a "contribution of materials" campaign was launched among the masses. The county successively contributed 3,157 steel drills and 8,919 pound hammers. They also adopted the strategic measure of "exploiting surface mines first, then taking underground treasures." In order to ensure the quality of the ore, each corps established an inspection team to implement an acceptance system. The broad masses were full of enthusiasm in mining. Many townships launched a day-and-night assault, and some townships fought hard in the rain. The county averaged 7,323 tons of ore mined per day.

Now, the Laiyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China has once again put forward the slogan to the people of the county to work hard for another fifteen days and reach 200,000 tons of ore mined.

    及早准备高炉过冬
    四川省突击储备矿石燃料
    涞源县完成半年采矿任务
  本报重庆28日电  四川省的九百万钢铁大军在抓紧建炉的同时，大抓矿石、燃料等的开采和准备工作，保证全省的生铁日产水平最近就能稳定在一万五千吨左右，并陆续提高。到25日止，全省各地的矿石库存量已经达到七十万吨以上，焦炭和木炭的库存量已达十四万七千吨。
    力争日产千吨生铁的开县、达县、綦江等县，都把投入钢铁战线的三分之二以上的力量集中来抓矿石、燃料等准备工作。在达县的铁矿山，已经聚集了十二万劳动大军，加紧进行挖矿、砍树、烧炭和运输等工作。目前，正在动工的矿洞有两千四百多个，已经生产的矿洞有一千五百多个。大量矿石和燃料正源源供应全县的三千多座高炉。江津专区到9月22日止，已经开挖了二千多个矿井，一百多个露天矿场，采出矿石十多万吨；全区9月份炼铁所需的矿石已经全部解决，目前正为10月份大力储备矿石。万县专区一百多万人的钢铁大军，70％担负采掘矿石、燃料和运输工作；在25日以前，已采集矿石十万吨。达县专区还掀起了开窑炼焦的高潮。富顺县人民在9月份建成焦窑一百五十座，全月将生产三万吨焦炭和煤。  （明  俊）
    据河北日报消息  河北省涞源县一万五千多人组成的采矿大军，经过十昼夜的鏖战，已经初获采矿大丰收。到9月16日，全县共采铁矿石七万三千二百三十一吨，超额一万三千二百三十一吨完成了下半年的采矿任务，给全县完成炼铁任务准备了丰足的矿石。
    中共涞源县委为了给高炉准备丰足的粮食，在发动群众大搞建炉、炼铁的同时，发动了一万五千多人，组成采矿大军，由几百名县、乡、社干部带领，分赴三十五个矿点上山扎营，开展了采矿突击战。采矿大军实行了组织军事化，共组成十三个战斗兵团，三十五个战斗营（其中妇女独立营三个）。为了解决采矿工具不足的问题，发动群众开展了“献物献料”运动。全县先后献出了钢钎三千一百五十七根，磅锤八千九百一十九个。他们还采取了“先搞地面矿，再取地下宝”的战略措施。为了保证矿石质量，各兵团都成立了检查组，实行了验收制度。广大群众在采矿当中，干劲冲天。许多乡日夜突击，有的乡冒雨苦战。全县每日平均采矿石七千三百二十三吨。
    现在，中共涞源县委又向全县人民提出了再干十五天，采矿达到二十万吨的口号。
