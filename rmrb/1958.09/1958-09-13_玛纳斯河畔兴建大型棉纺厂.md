Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 12th. A huge modern textile mill—the Shihezi August 1st Textile Mill—has begun construction in the new city of Shihezi, in the Manas River basin of the northern Xinjiang cotton-growing region. This is a textile complex with 200,000 spindles. The total construction area of the textile mill is 440,000 square meters, and the entire project will be built in three phases. After the first phase of the project is completed next year, 50,000 spindles will be put into production.

After the Shihezi August 1st Textile Mill is fully completed in 1961, the cotton produced on both banks of the Manas River can be woven into cotton cloth on the spot to supply the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region.

    玛纳斯河畔兴建大型棉纺厂
    据新华社乌鲁木齐12日电　一座规模巨大的现代化纺织厂——石河子八一纺织厂，开始在新疆北部植棉区玛纳斯河流域石河子新城兴建。这是一座拥有二十万纱锭的纺织联合企业。纺织厂的总建筑面积达四十四万平方公尺，全部工程分三期建成。第一期工程在明年完工后，就有五万支纱锭投入生产。
    石河子八一纺织厂到1961年全部建成之后，就可以使玛纳斯河两岸生产的棉花，就地织成棉布，供应自治区各族人民。
