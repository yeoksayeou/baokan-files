Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd - TASS reported on the 21st, issuing a statement saying:

The newspapers have already reported that on September 19th, Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, wrote to U.S. President Eisenhower concerning the situation in the Taiwan area. The Soviet government leader wrote to the U.S. President out of serious concern for the intensification of the tense situation in the Far East, which endangers the cause of peace. This tense situation has been caused by the aggressive actions of the U.S. ruling clique in the Taiwan Strait area. Public opinion around the world unanimously believes that this letter is a new and important initiative by the Soviet Union in its consistent struggle to safeguard and consolidate world peace.

Those who bear direct responsibility for the situation in the Taiwan area, which threatens the cause of safeguarding peace, have reacted differently to Khrushchev's letter. TASS has learned that the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, on September 21st, on the orders of the U.S. government, returned Khrushchev's letter to the U.S. President, insisting that the letter was unacceptable.

This step by the U.S. government is difficult to assess in any other way than as proof that the U.S. leadership is unwilling to listen to rational appeals. It is further proof of how little consideration the U.S. leadership gives to the voices of the people of all countries, who demand an end to the policy of threatening force that is pushing the world to the brink of war, and a move toward the peaceful resolution of outstanding international issues. This response once again proves that, for the people in the aforementioned clique, "the truth is blinding."

As for the Soviet government, it will continue to actively and unwaveringly defend the cause of safeguarding peace, and will continue to speak the truth, whether or not such people like it, those whose policy is to constantly create sources of serious international conflict, sometimes in this region of the world and sometimes in that region of the world.

Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd - According to TASS, Moscow: A "Pravda" commentator wrote today that the U.S. government's announcement that it "does not accept Khrushchev's letter to Eisenhower and is returning it to the Soviet government is a violation of diplomatically recognized principles and practices. This action was taken at the instigation of those who seek to further exacerbate the international situation. It shows that the U.S. ruling clique is using any means to intensify international tensions." The commentator pointed out that the Anglo-Saxon proverb "the truth hurts" has become Washington's code of conduct. The U.S. government refuses to listen to the solemn truth stated by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union in his letter because it exposes the U.S.'s provocative acts against China and shows the world who is the culprit creating the danger of military conflict in the Far East, and who is threatening world peace.

The "Pravda" commentator emphasized that returning the letter cannot hide the truth from the people. The planners of military adventures cannot escape responsibility for their provocative and aggressive actions in the Far East.

### 艾森豪威尔悍然拒绝赫鲁晓夫的信件  塔斯社斥美国当局不听理智呼声

    艾森豪威尔悍然拒绝赫鲁晓夫的信件
    塔斯社斥美国当局不听理智呼声
    新华社22日讯　塔斯社21日发表声明说：
    报纸前已报道，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫9月19日曾经就台湾地区局势问题写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔。苏联政府首脑写信给美国总统，是出于对危害和平事业的远东紧张局势的尖锐化的严重关怀，而远东紧张局势尖锐化是由于美国统治集团在台湾海峡地区的侵略行动造成的。世界各地公众都一致认为，这封信是苏联在它一贯为维护和巩固世界和平的斗争中的一个新的重要倡议。
    那些对威胁维护和平事业的台湾地区局势负有直接责任的人对赫鲁晓夫的信的反应却不同。塔斯社获悉，美国驻莫斯科大使馆9月21日奉美国政府之命退回了赫鲁晓夫写给美国总统的信，硬说这封信是不能接受的。
    美国政府的这一步骤很难作别的估价，它只能证明美国领导集团不愿意倾听理智的呼声，它再一次证明美国领导集团对各国人民的呼声考虑得多么少，各国人民要求终止把世界推向战争边缘的武力威胁政策，走上和平解决悬而未决的国际问题的道路。这个回答再一次证明，对上述集团的人来说，“真理是刺眼的”。
    至于苏联政府，它今后仍将积极地、始终不渝地捍卫维护和平的事业，仍将讲出真理，不管这样一些人是否喜欢，这些人的政策就是：时而在世界这一地区、时而在世界那一地区经常制造严重的国际冲突的策源地。
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”评论员今天写道，美国政府宣布“不接受赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信并把它退回苏联政府，这一行动是对外交上公认的原则和惯例的破坏。这种行动是在那些企图使国际局势进一步尖锐化的人的指使下采取的。它表明美国统治集团在不择手段来加剧国际紧张局势。”评论员指出，盎格鲁—撒克逊的谚语“说真话的人常常碰壁”成了华盛顿的行动准绳。美国政府拒绝倾听苏联部长会议主席在信中所说的严正的真理，是因为它揭露了美国对中国的挑衅行为并向全世界表明，谁是制造远东军事冲突危险的罪人，谁在威胁世界和平。
    “真理报”评论员强调说，退回信件并不能向人民隐瞒真理。军事冒险的策划者逃脱不了在远东进行挑衅和侵略行动的责任。
