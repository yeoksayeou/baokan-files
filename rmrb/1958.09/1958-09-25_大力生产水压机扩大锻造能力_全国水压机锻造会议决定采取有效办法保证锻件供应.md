Xinhua News Agency, 24th. The National Hydraulic Press Forging Conference decided to take forceful measures to ensure that the heavy machinery forging requirements for the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year are fully met. The conference proposed that the primary measure for increasing the production of large forgings is to mobilize all existing hydraulic presses, improve their equipment efficiency, and undertake greater forging tasks. In this regard, the representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed that the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant is a model. From January to August this year, the total weight of forgings produced by this plant using hydraulic presses was equivalent to 97.4% of the total for the entire last year, with an average equipment utilization rate of over 80%. Now, the workers are further tapping potential and are determined to increase the unit hourly output of hydraulic presses by another 50% in the last four months of this year. At the meeting, representatives from this plant shared their experiences, and other factories with hydraulic presses also proposed improvement measures based on problems existing in production. According to the new plans proposed by various factories, the output of forgings in the last four months of this year will increase by more than double the original plan. Factories currently installing hydraulic presses have also proposed measures to speed up installation and strive to put them into production early.

The conference proposed that the fundamental measure to expand forging capacity is to accelerate the production, installation, and use of hydraulic presses and large forging hammers. In addition to the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant preparing to manufacture three 2,500-ton hydraulic presses by the end of the year, many regions such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin are also manufacturing hydraulic presses. However, due to poor coordination of supporting facilities and a lack of technical experience, progress has been relatively slow. The conference studied this situation and immediately took measures to organize supporting facilities, and dispatched working groups to factories to specifically assist in solving technical problems, striving for these hydraulic presses to be manufactured earlier or on schedule. At the same time, the conference requested regions installing hydraulic presses to immediately seize the time to do a good job in relevant infrastructure construction, personnel training, and other preparatory work, so that once the hydraulic presses are manufactured, they can be installed and used immediately.

While tapping the production potential of hydraulic presses, the conference also summarized the experiences created by the masses in various places, such as "using iron instead of steel, using casting instead of forging, breaking large into small, and combining small into large." Many factories divide large forgings in heavy machinery into small forgings, and then use mechanical joining or welding methods to manufacture them. Some factories use cast steel or high-grade cast iron to replace forgings in manufacturing rolling mill rolls, generator main shafts, etc. The conference believes that these experiences are very valuable and should be universally tested and promoted, so that existing heavy machinery factories can free up resources to manufacture larger hydraulic presses and enhance forging capabilities.

The National Hydraulic Press Forging Conference was convened by the First Ministry of Machine Building on the 15th in Beijing. In addition to studying the expansion of hydraulic press production capacity, the conference also arranged the national forging production tasks for the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year, based on the principle of ensuring key projects while taking into account general needs. Among them, the forgings required for power stations, metallurgical equipment, and large machine tools can basically be met; appropriate arrangements have also been made for the forgings required for equipment such as coal, petroleum, and chemical industries.

    大力生产水压机扩大锻造能力
    全国水压机锻造会议决定采取有效办法保证锻件供应
    新华社24日讯  全国水压机锻造会议决定采取有力措施，使今年第四季度和明年第一季度全国重型机械所需锻件得到充分的供应。会议提出当前增加大型锻件生产的首要措施，是把现有的水压机通通调动起来，提高它们的设备效能，担负起更大的锻造任务。在这方面，参加会议的代表们一致认为沈阳重型机器厂是一面红旗。这个厂在今年1月到8月里利用水压机生产的锻件总重已相当于去年全年的97.4％，设备利用率平均达到80％以上。现在职工们又进一步挖掘潜力，决心在今年的后四个月内使水压机的单位台时产量再提高50％。会上，这个厂的代表介绍了经验，其他有水压机的工厂也针对生产中存在的问题提出了改进措施。按照各厂新提出的计划，今年后四个月的锻件产量将比原计划提高一倍以上。目前正在安装水压机的工厂，也提出了加快安装、争取提早投入生产的措施。
    会议提出扩大锻造能力的根本措施，是加快水压机、大型锻锤的生产和安装使用。除了沈阳重型机器厂准备在年底制成三台两千五百吨水压机外，北京、上海、天津等许多地区都在制造水压机。但是因为配套、协作没有组织好，又缺少技术经验，进度比较缓慢。会议研究了这种情况，立即采取了组织配套等措施，并派出工作组下厂，具体协助解决技术问题，争取这些水压机能提早或按期制造出来。同时，会议要求安装水压机的地区，立即抓紧时间做好有关基建、人员培训等准备工作，等水压机制造出来，就立即安装使用。
    会议在挖掘水压机生产潜力的同时，还总结了各地群众创造的“以铁代钢、以铸代锻、化大为小、并小成大”的经验。许多工厂把重型机器中的大锻件分成小锻件，然后采用机械并合或焊接的方法来制造。有些工厂以铸钢或高级铸铁来代替锻件制造轧钢机的轧辊、发电机的主轴等。会议认为，这些经验十分宝贵，应该普遍试验推广，以便现有的重型机器厂能够腾出力量制造更大的水压机，增强锻造力量。
    全国水压机锻造会议是第一机械工业部15日在北京召开的。会议除研究了扩大水压机生产能力外，还根据保证重点、兼顾一般的方针，安排了今年第四季和明年第一季全国锻件的生产任务。其中，电站、冶金设备和大型机床所需要的锻件，已基本上能够满足；其他如煤炭、石油、化工等设备需要的锻件，也作了适当安排。
