Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The increasingly blatant military provocations and war threats by American aggressors in the Taiwan Straits region in recent days have aroused the unanimous and resolute opposition of the 600 million people of China. The national demonstration movement is sweeping the country like a raging tide. According to preliminary statistics from various regions, more than 60 million people have participated in demonstrations and protest rallies as of tonight. The protest movement is continuing to develop.

This is a magnificent and powerful anti-aggression struggle. The marching masses in various places, with their fearless spirit, strongly expressed that they are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and are determined to resolutely and thoroughly eliminate any aggressors who dare to invade.

Up to now, the American warmongers still have no intention of withdrawing their aggressive bloody hands. American warships have continued to intrude into our territorial waters, disregarding the repeated warnings of our government, and have openly held provocative large-scale military exercises in conjunction with the Chiang Kai-shek troops. This is an extremely dangerous action, and the entire Chinese people are closely watching the development of the situation in the Taiwan Straits region.

　　六亿人民对美国侵略者的严正答复
　　全国示威运动怒涛澎湃
    新华社8日讯　这几天以来，美国侵略者在台湾海峡地区进行越来越嚣张的军事挑衅和战争威胁，激起了全中国六亿人民举国一致的坚决反对。全国的示威运动如怒涛澎湃，到今天晚上为止，各地初步统计，有六千多万人参加了示威游行和抗议集会。现在抗议运动正在继续发展。
    这是一个气壮山河的强大的反侵略斗争。各地游行群众以无畏的精神强烈地表示，他们准备随时响应祖国的召唤，一定要坚决彻底地消灭敢于进犯的侵略者。
    直到现在为止，美国战争贩子仍然无意缩回它侵略的血手，美国军舰竟然不顾我国政府的一再警告，继续侵入我国领海，并且公开同蒋介石军队联合举行挑衅性的大规模军事演习。这是一种极端危险的行动，全中国人民正在密切注视着台湾海峡地区形势的发展。
