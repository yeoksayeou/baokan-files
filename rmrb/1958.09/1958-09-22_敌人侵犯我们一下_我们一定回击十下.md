Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 21st: People from all walks of life in Fujian Province, situated on the front lines of coastal defense, wholeheartedly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement refuting U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's speech at the United Nations General Assembly, and warmly welcome Khrushchev's renewed warning to Eisenhower regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait. The broad masses of people in the frontline areas have expressed their determination to further improve all preparatory work and to fight to the end for the liberation of Jinmen (Quemoy), Mazu (Matsu), and Taiwan.

More than 1,300 sailors from the Fuzhou Maritime Administration Bureau expressed extreme anger at Dulles's shameless slander at the United Nations General Assembly, which reversed black and white and smeared the Chinese people. Jiang Zengwang, a ship driver, said that Dulles, with his eyes closed, falsely claimed that the Chinese people's exercise of their sacred rights was "aggression," which is utter nonsense. The sailors all believe that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement represents the will of the 600 million Chinese people. The Chinese people love peace, but they will never succumb to the war threats of imperialism. No matter how Dulles and Eisenhower clamor, they cannot scare the Chinese people. The Chinese people's determination and will to liberate Taiwan are harder than steel and higher than the sky. If U.S. imperialism does not know its place and insists on being the enemy of the Chinese people, we will resolutely drive out the robbers who occupy our territory. The sailors expressed that they will excellently complete the task of supporting the front lines, and continuously send materials to the front lines to support the People's Liberation Army in fiercely attacking the U.S. aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique under their protection.

The members of the Gushan People's Commune in the suburbs of Fuzhou City were carrying out a major cleanup this morning to welcome the ninth anniversary of the National Day. After they read the nonsense spoken by Dulles in the newspaper, they were all filled with anger, expressing that they would never give up until they recovered the motherland's territory from U.S. imperialism. The 400 support-the-frontline laborers gathered in the commune's auditorium unanimously proposed to ensure the excellent completion of the support-the-frontline tasks. Laborer Guo Nundi and militia captain Ye Biliang resolutely said: If the American bandits dare to slap us once, we will definitely return ten punches.

The heads of the Fujian Provincial and Fuzhou Municipal local organizations of various democratic parties all issued statements today, unanimously supporting Foreign Minister Chen's statement. Lin Zhifu, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement once again expressed the will and determination of the Chinese people, and U.S. imperialism must get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. All members of the Fujian Provincial Democratic League are ready, and as long as the motherland gives an order, we will fight to the end to defend the motherland. Wang Tianqiang, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Fujian Provincial Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said that Dulles's slander at the United Nations General Assembly, falsely claiming that our country's liberation of its own territory Taiwan and coastal islands is "aggression," fully exposes the rogue nature of U.S. imperialism, which is accustomed to aggression and cries "stop thief!" while stealing. His clamor, which reverses right and wrong, cannot deceive anyone. He also said that the people of Taiwan have long been under the trampling of the U.S. and Chiang, and look forward day and night to the motherland rescuing them as soon as possible. All Taiwanese compatriots living in Fujian have made preparations, and once the motherland calls, they will resolutely prepare to fight back to their hometowns together with the people of the motherland.

Lin Zhuguang, Vice Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and a returned Overseas Chinese from Malaya, said that more than three million returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives in Fujian Province have been mobilized, and young returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives have also joined the militia, ready to participate in the battle to recover Jinmen and Mazu at any time.

    敌人侵犯我们一下　我们一定回击十下
    新华社福州21日电　处在海防前线的福建省各界人民竭诚拥护陈毅外交部长驳斥美国国务卿杜勒斯在联合国大会上发言的声明，并热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫就台湾海峡局势问题再次对艾森豪威尔提出的警告。前线地区广大人民纷纷表示决心进一步作好各项准备工作，为解放金门、马祖和解放台湾而斗争到底。
    福州市海运管理局的一千三百多海员，对杜勒斯在联合国大会上发表的颠倒黑白污蔑中国人民的无耻谰言表示万分愤怒。轮船司机江增望说，杜勒斯闭着眼睛诬称中国人民行使自己的神圣权利是“侵略”，真是胡说八道。海员们都认为，陈毅外交部长的声明代表了六亿中国人民的意志，中国人民热爱和平，但是也绝不会在帝国主义的战争威胁面前屈服。不论杜勒斯、艾森豪威尔怎样叫嚣，也吓不倒中国人民。中国人民解放台湾的决心和意志，比钢都硬，比天都高，如果美帝国主义不识时务，坚持与中国人民为敌，我们就要坚决把霸占我国领土的强盗赶出去。海员们表示要出色地完成支援前线的任务，随时把物资源源送到前线去，支援人民解放军狠狠打击美国侵略者和它庇护下的蒋介石卖国集团。
    福州市郊鼓山人民公社的社员们，今天清早正在进行大扫除以迎接国庆九周年。当他们从报纸上看到杜勒斯说的那些鬼话以后，个个怒火冲天，表示不从美帝国主义手中收复祖国的土地誓不罢休。集中在公社礼堂里的四百名整装待发的支前民工们，一致提出要保证出色地完成支前任务。民工郭黁俤、民兵队长叶必良等都坚决地说：美国强盗敢打我们一巴掌，我们一定还他十拳头。
    各民主党派福建省和福州市地方组织的负责人今天都发表谈话，一致拥护陈外长的声明。民盟福建省委主任委员林植夫说，陈毅外长的声明再次表达了中国人民的意志和决心，美帝国主义必须从台湾和台湾海峡滚出去。我们福建省全体民盟盟员已准备好一切，只要祖国一声号召，我们就要为保卫祖国而战斗到底。台湾民主自治同盟福建省支部筹备委员会主任王天强说，杜勒斯在联合国大会上污称我国解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿是“侵略”，这充分暴露了略侵成性的美帝国主义贼喊捉贼的无赖本质。他的颠倒是非的叫嚣是欺骗不了任何人的。他还说，台湾同胞长期在美蒋蹂躏之下，日夜盼望祖国早日把他们拯救出来。我们旅居福建的全体台胞已经作好准备，一旦祖国召唤，就坚决同祖国人民一起准备打回故乡去。
    福建省归国华侨联合会副主席马来亚归国华侨林珠光说，我们福建省三百多万归侨、侨眷已经动员起来，年青的归侨、侨眷还参加了民兵，随时准备参加收复金门、马祖的战斗。
