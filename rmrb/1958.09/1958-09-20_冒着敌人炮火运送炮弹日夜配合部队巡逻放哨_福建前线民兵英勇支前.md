Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 18th. The broad masses of militia in the Fujian frontline area, long tempered in the struggle against the enemy, heroically cooperate with and support the People's Liberation Army in winning battles.

The militia in various frontline areas have proactively strengthened joint defense activities with the PLA troops and have established various support-the-front organizations for stretcher-bearing, transportation, rescue, fire-fighting, and security. Along the long coastal defense line, militiamen patrol and stand guard day and night in cooperation with the troops. All important transportation routes and surrounding villages, factories, docks, and warehouses are guarded vigilantly by armed militiamen. At one point, floods washed away highways and bridges in a certain area, and the nearby militiamen immediately mobilized to repair them day and night. Whenever enemy shells exploded near highways and bridges, militiamen would immediately rush to the point of explosion to inspect or repair, promptly ensuring the smooth flow of the frontline transportation lines. One militia team in a certain township repaired 44 sections of highway damaged by floods in half a month, totaling more than 15 kilometers in length, and repaired 14 bridges. They also helped the troops transport large quantities of materials and build many fortifications. Militiamen He Jiuzhou, He Minglei, and others braved torrential rain and jumped into the raging torrents to block the gaps with their bodies while repairing a section of national defense highway damaged by floods. In some places, militiamen often braved enemy fire to help troops transport ammunition, acting as "ammunition carriers" to strike the enemy fiercely; during lulls in the fighting, they joined the soldiers in adding to fortifications and learning military techniques from the soldiers.

While heroically supporting the frontline, the frontline militia also actively and diligently engage in production. During the day, they dig air raid shelters by the fields and persist in production. At night, they work in the fields by the dim moonlight. They also use the gaps between fighting and production to carry out pre-enemy training exercises, rapidly improving their ability to kill the enemy with the help of the officers and soldiers of the troops.

The broad masses of militia on the Fujian front have forged a deep friendship with the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. They often visit and help each other. Soldiers transfer the condolences sent by the people to the militia, and the militiamen also give the prizes awarded to them by the government to the soldiers.

    冒着敌人炮火运送炮弹日夜配合部队巡逻放哨
    福建前线民兵英勇支前
    新华社福建前线18日电　在对敌斗争中久经锻炼的福建前线地区广大民兵，英勇配合和支援解放军胜利作战。
    前线各地民兵主动地同解放军部队加强了联防活动，并成立了担架、运输、救护、消防和警卫等各种支前组织。在漫长的海防线上，民兵们日日夜夜配合部队巡逻放哨。各个交通要道和村庄周围、工厂、码头和仓库旁边，都有手持武器的民兵警惕地守护着。有一个时期洪水冲垮了某地的公路和桥梁，附近的民兵立即出动日夜抢修。敌人的炮弹只要在公路、桥梁旁边一爆炸，民兵们便立即向爆炸点跑去，进行检查或修复，及时地保证前线运输线的畅通。某乡一支民兵队在半个月中，就抢修公路四十四段次，共有十五公里多长，修复桥梁十四座，并帮助部队运输了大批物资，修筑了许多工事。民兵何久宙、何明类等在抢修一段洪水冲坏的国防公路时，冒着暴雨，奋不顾身地跃入急流，用身体堵住缺口。有些地方的民兵还常常冒着敌人的炮火，帮助部队运送炮弹，充当“运弹手”，狠狠地打击敌人；他们在战斗的间隙，又和战士们一起加修工事，向战士们学习军事技术。
    前线民兵在英勇支援前线的同时，也积极勤劳地生产。白天，他们在田边挖好防炮洞，坚持生产，夜里，他们借着蒙蒙的月光，下田劳动。他们还利用战斗和生产的空隙，开展敌前练兵运动，在部队官兵帮助下，迅速提高杀敌本领。
    福建前线广大民兵已和解放军官兵们结下了深厚的友谊。他们经常互相慰问、帮助。战士们把人民送来的慰问品转赠给民兵，民兵们也把政府发给他们的奖品送给战士。
