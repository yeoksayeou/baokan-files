Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan News: Ningxia's three universities jointly held an opening ceremony on the 15th. More than 300 students of Hui and Han nationalities have registered and enrolled, many of whom are children of workers and peasants.

These three universities are the Teachers College, the Agricultural College, and the Medical College, all of which are located in Yinchuan City. Each college will resolutely implement the educational policy that education must be combined with productive labor. In addition to completing the study plan on time each academic year, each student will also complete one hundred and twenty to one hundred and fifty labor days. The establishment of these three colleges in Ningxia has been supported by Beijing Normal University, East China Normal University, Beijing Normal College, Shanghai Second Normal College, and Northwest Normal College in terms of faculty.

Before liberation, there was no university in the Ningxia area, and the children of the broad masses of Hui people had few opportunities to enter universities. The establishment of these three universities marks a new historical stage in the educational undertakings of minority areas in Ningxia.

    宁夏教育事业跨进新的历史阶段
    三所高等学校在银川建立
    新华社银川讯　宁夏三所高等学校，15日联合举行开学典礼。三百多名回汉族学生已报到入学，其中很多是工农子弟。
    这三所高等学校是师范学院、农学院和医学院，它们都设在银川市。各学院将坚决贯彻教育必须与生产劳动相结合的办学方针，每个学生每学年除按时完成学习计划外，还要完成一百二十到一百五十个劳动日。宁夏这三所高等学院的建立，在师资上曾得到北京师范大学、华东师范大学、北京师范学院、上海第二师范学院和西北师范学院的支援。
    解放前，宁夏地区没有一所高等学校，广大回族人民的子女很少有升入高等学校的机会，这三个高等学校的成立，使宁夏少数民族地区教育事业又跨进一个新的历史阶段。
