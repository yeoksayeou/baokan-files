Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 29th: After several years of struggle, especially the hard battle of the past six months, the people of Fujian Province have basically eliminated schistosomiasis.

At present, in the schistosomiasis epidemic areas of the province, the Oncomelania snails on 13.79 million square meters of land have nearly disappeared, with the most effective snail eradication reaching 100% snail-free. Of the 44,964 schistosomiasis patients in the province, except for those with severe contraindications and pregnant women who will be treated gradually in the future, all the rest have been treated, accounting for 96.5% of the total number of patients. The 5,086 farm cattle suffering from schistosomiasis in various places have also been basically cured. In the epidemic area, in conjunction with the manure accumulation and the patriotic health campaign, the excrement is managed by assigned personnel and a management system has been established. All manure pits have been covered and sealed for regular storage. The masses in the affected areas are all using well water and disinfected water. After appraisal, the above achievements have met the central government's interim standards for the basic elimination of schistosomiasis.

The schistosomiasis epidemic area in coastal Fujian faces the Jinmen and Matsu Islands, occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and the struggle against the enemy is very tense. Since 1950, while leading the people to develop production and persist in the struggle, the Party and the government have carried out large-scale schistosomiasis prevention and control work. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses have shown many moving deeds in the fight against the disease. Many militiamen guarding the coastal defense forefront stand at the forefront of eliminating the disease. They formed a large snail eradication army, some tied long ropes to climb mountain cliffs, and some led the masses to chase from the plains to the mountains, from the lower reaches to the upper reaches, to thoroughly find and eliminate the breeding grounds of Oncomelania snails. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Nan'an, Fuqing, and other places transferred a large amount of manpower and material resources to support the local masses in eliminating Oncomelania snails. Medical personnel at all levels often go deep into the communes and teams to provide door-to-door treatment for patients. After the people in the affected areas regained their health, they have picked up hoes and guns again and happily devoted themselves to production labor and the struggle to defend the motherland's coastal defense.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 28th: Schistosomiasis, which has plagued the people of Jiading, Shanghai, Baoshan, and Pudong counties under the jurisdiction of Shanghai for nearly a hundred years, has now been basically eliminated in Jiading and Shanghai counties, and completely eliminated in Baoshan and Pudong counties. As of the 27th, after the evaluation by Shanghai Municipality, counties, and townships, it was considered that they fully met the standards for the complete and basic elimination of schistosomiasis. The people of Shanghai are jubilantly taking this victory as a gift for this year's National Day.

Shanghai's experience proves that the work of preventing and controlling schistosomiasis must be politically led and must be combined with agricultural production. When the Party proposed the basic elimination of schistosomiasis, some experts in Shanghai were skeptical and even resistant. They also expressed opposing opinions to the Party's proposed active prevention and control policies and comprehensive measures. Some prevention workers demanded that Oncomelania snails be eliminated first, temporarily abandoning the treatment of hundreds of thousands of patients. Snail eradication also had to be carried out simply with certain drugs that were currently unable to be supplied in large quantities. For treatment work, some people demanded the establishment of a large number of hospitals and the adoption of the slow, inefficient, and costly treatment methods that were so-called authoritative in the literature. This kind of thinking also eroded some prevention and control work cadres, making them conservative and shrinking, which once created a cold and deserted situation in the prevention and control work. In the rectification movement, this bourgeois ideology was criticized. The ideological awareness of prevention and control work cadres has been greatly improved. Since the spring of this year, all counties and townships have been led by the Party Committee secretaries, who personally took action to mobilize the masses to carry out prevention and control work closely in combination with agricultural production, mainly using the native methods created by the masses - shoveling soil to remove grass, and burying soil to kill snails. In the spring snail eradication campaign alone, 95% of the Oncomelania snails were eliminated, and 150 million dan of manure were accumulated, 18.08 million cubic meters of water conservancy were repaired, and 250,000 mu of farmland were improved, achieving four benefits at once. Medical personnel have also changed their style of waiting for patients to be hospitalized, and adopted decentralized in-depth rural outpatient clinics, and rapid and safe antimony agent three-day treatment methods. In July alone, a total of 31,000 patients were treated, which is equivalent to twice the total number of treatments in the entire last year.

The experience of the past two years has also proved that even in water network areas like Shanghai, as long as the broad masses are mobilized to continuously and uninterruptedly drain the river water to kill snails for several months, and shovel soil, remove grass, spray pesticides, and burn on the banks of snail-infested rivers for six to ten times, the Oncomelania snails can be eliminated.

### 血防战线上的一个巨大胜利  福建省上海市基本消灭血吸虫病

    血防战线上的一个巨大胜利
    福建省上海市基本消灭血吸虫病
    新华社福州29日电  福建省人民经过几年来的斗争，特别是半年来的苦战，已基本消灭了血吸虫病。
    目前全省血吸虫病流行区内一千三百七十九万平方公尺面积土地上的钉螺，已接近绝迹，灭螺效果最高的达到百分之百无螺。全省四万四千九百六十四个血吸虫病患者，除患有严重禁忌症和孕妇尚待今后陆续治疗外，其余都已全部治疗，占病人总数96.5％。各地患有血吸虫病的五千零八十六头耕牛也已基本治完。流行区内结合积肥和除四害、讲卫生运动，粪便已由专人负责和建立了管理制度，全部粪池进行了加盖密封，定期贮存。病区群众已全部使用井水和消毒水。经过鉴定，上述成绩已符合中央关于基本消灭血吸虫病的暂行标准。
    福建沿海血吸虫病流行区面对着蒋介石卖国集团盘踞的金门、马祖等岛屿，对敌斗争十分紧张。自1950年来，党和政府在领导人民发展生产、坚持斗争的同时，开展了大规模的血吸虫病防治工作。广大群众在党的领导下，在和疾病作斗争中出现了许多可歌可泣的事迹。许多守卫在海防前哨的民兵都站在消灭疾病的最前列，他们组成了灭螺大军，有的身缚长绳爬上山谷悬崖，有的带领群众从平原追到山上、从下游追到上游，彻底寻找和消灭钉螺的孳生地。南安、福清等地的人民解放军驻军调出大批人力和物力，支援当地群众消灭钉螺。各地医务人员经常深入社队，巡回上门为病人治疗。病区的人民恢复健康后已重新拿起锄头和枪支，愉快地投入生产劳动和保卫祖国海防的斗争。
    据新华社上海28日电  为害上海市所属嘉定、上海、宝山、浦东四县人民近百年的血吸虫病，现在在嘉定和上海两县已经基本消灭，在宝山和浦东两县已彻底消灭。到27日为止，经过上海市、县、乡逐级的鉴定，认为它们完全合乎彻底和基本消灭血吸虫病的标准。上海人民正欢欣鼓舞地把这个胜利作为今年国庆节的献礼。
    上海的经验证明，防治血吸虫病的工作必须政治挂帅，必须同农业生产结合进行。当党提出基本消灭血吸虫病的时候，上海有些专家曾经怀疑，甚至有抵触情绪。他们对党提出的积极防治方针和综合措施也表示相反的意见。有的预防工作者要求首先消灭钉螺，暂时放弃数以十万计的病人的治疗工作。灭螺又要单纯用某些目前无法大量供应的药物进行。对于治疗工作，有的要求大量办医院，采取文献上所谓权威的少慢差费的治疗方法。这种思想也侵蚀了一些防治工作干部，使他们保守、畏缩，一度造成了防治工作冷冷清清的局面。在整风运动中，这种资产阶级思想受到批判。防治工作干部思想觉悟大为提高。从今年春天开始，各县、乡全部由党委书记挂帅，亲自动手，发动群众紧密结合农业生产来进行防治工作，主要采用群众创造的土办法——铲土除草、土埋灭螺。仅在春天的灭螺运动中，就消灭了钉螺95％，而且积肥一亿五千万担，修治水利一千八百零八万土方，改良土壤二十五万亩田地，一举四得。医务人员也改变了等病人住院的作风，采取分散深入农村门诊，快速而安全的锑剂三日疗法。在7月份一个月内，共治疗了三万一千个病人，等于去年全年治疗总数的两倍。
    两年多来的经验也证明了：即使像上海这样的水网地区，只要发动广大群众，在几个月内连续不间断地抽干河水灭螺，在有螺河道的岸上铲土锄草、喷药、火烧，进行六次到十次，钉螺是可以消灭的。
