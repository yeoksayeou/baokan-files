    Capable of Driving on Snow, Sand, Grassland, and Mud
    China's first three-axle drive high off-road performance truck was produced on the 20th at the First Automobile Works in Changchun.

    This type of vehicle is suitable for a variety of uses. In particular, because the three axles and six wheels are equipped with ultra-low pressure deep tread tires, it can not only drive on hard roads, but also on snow, sand, wet grassland, and muddy ground. The cab is equipped with heating, defrosting, ventilation, and winter start preheating devices, making it adaptable to any harsh climate.
