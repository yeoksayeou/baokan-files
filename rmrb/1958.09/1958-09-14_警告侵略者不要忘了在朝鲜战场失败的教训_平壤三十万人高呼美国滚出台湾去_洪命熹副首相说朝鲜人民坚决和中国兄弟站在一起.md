Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 13th. A rally of more than 300,000 people was held in Pyongyang today afternoon in Kim Il-sung Square to protest against the U.S. imperialist war provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait.

The spacious Kim Il-sung Square and the surrounding streets were packed with angry crowds. They held up huge banners and chanted slogans such as "U.S. imperialism get out of Taiwan immediately," "U.S. imperialism immediately stop its war provocations in the Taiwan Strait," and "We support the just struggle of the Chinese people." The thunderous roar shook the city of Pyongyang.

The meeting began at 5 p.m. Korean Deputy Prime Minister Hong Myung-hee spoke at the meeting. He said that the U.S. imperialist acts of aggression in the Taiwan Strait are a serious provocation to the Chinese people and an intolerable criminal act against peace in the Far East and the world.

Hong Myung-hee said that the Korean people resolutely condemn the U.S. imperialist acts of aggression, fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement, and fully support the just actions of the Chinese people to liberate their sacred territory. Any aggression against the People's Republic of China, the brotherly neighbor of the Korean people, is also a serious threat to the Korean people. Hong Myung-hee pointed out that the U.S. establishment of missile bases in South Korea and its acts of aggression in the Taiwan Strait show that the U.S. is preparing for war. He demanded that the U.S. imperialists immediately stop their acts of aggression in the Taiwan Strait and South Korea, and immediately withdraw their aggressive troops from these areas. He said that this is the firm demand of the Korean and Chinese peoples and the unanimous demand of world opinion. He said that U.S. imperialism should not forget the lessons of its defeat on the Korean battlefield. The 600 million people of great New China have ample strength to give the enemies who attempt to invade their motherland the counterattack they deserve.

If U.S. imperialism provokes war again, it will bring about its own destruction.

Hong Myung-hee finally led the masses in chanting: "U.S. imperialism get out of Taiwan, get out of South Korea." At this time, more than 300,000 fists in the square were raised together, and angry roars resounded through the sky.

Then, representatives of workers, peasants, students, and cultural and artistic circles spoke at the meeting. They unanimously condemned the U.S. imperialist provocative acts in the Taiwan Strait and expressed their willingness to join the Chinese people in the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression.

Cao Keqiang, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, said at the meeting that the firm support of the Korean people for the Chinese people will further inspire the Chinese people's will to fight. He said that the people of China and Korea have fought against the U.S. aggressor troops. If U.S. imperialism dares to take military risks, it and its lackeys will suffer even more惨重的defeats.

The conference finally passed a resolution expressing full support for the statement issued by the Republic's government supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area.

The resolution said that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is the Chinese people's internal affair and the Chinese people's sacred and inviolable right. The Korean people cannot remain indifferent to the provocations of U.S. imperialist aggressors against the Chinese people. Any provocation against the Chinese people is also a threat to the Korean people.

The resolution demanded that the U.S. imperialists immediately stop their provocations and withdraw from Taiwan and South Korea.

Those who attended today's meeting included Korean Deputy Prime Ministers Kim Il, Jung Il-ryong, and Jung Joon-taek, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Kim Chang-man, ministers of the Cabinet and ministers of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, heads of democratic parties and social organizations, senior generals of the People's Army, labor heroes, and production innovators.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Korea were also invited to attend the meeting.

Representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army stationed in Pyongyang and Chinese students in Korea also attended the meeting.

    警告侵略者不要忘了在朝鲜战场失败的教训
    平壤三十万人高呼美国滚出台湾去
    洪命熹副首相说朝鲜人民坚决和中国兄弟站在一起
    新华社平壤13日电　平壤市三十多万人今天下午在金日成广场举行集会，抗议美帝国主义在台湾海峡对中国进行战争挑衅。
    宽阔的金日成广场和周围的街道上都挤满了愤怒的人群。他们高举着巨幅的标语，不停地高呼“美帝国主义立即从台湾滚出去”、“美帝国主义马上停止在台湾海峡的战争挑衅”、“我们支持中国人民的正义斗争”等口号。雷霆般的怒吼震动着平壤城。
    大会在下午五时开始，朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹在大会上讲话。他说，美帝国主义在台湾海峡的侵略行为是对中国人民的严重挑衅，同时也是对远东和世界和平的不可容忍的犯罪行为。
    洪命熹说，朝鲜人民坚决谴责美帝国主义的侵略行为，完全支持周恩来总理的声明，完全支持中国人民解放自己神圣领土的正义行动。对朝鲜人民兄弟般的邻邦——中华人民共和国的任何侵略也就是对朝鲜人民的严重威胁。洪命熹指出，美国在南朝鲜建立导弹基地，在台湾海峡进行侵略行为，这说明美国在准备战争。他要求美帝国主义者立即停止在台湾海峡和南朝鲜的侵略行为，立即把它的侵略军队从这些地区撤走。他说，这是朝中人民的坚决主张，是全世界舆论的一致要求。他说，美帝国主义不应该忘记它在朝鲜战场上遭到失败的教训，伟大的新中国的六亿人民有充分的力量对敌人侵犯自己祖国的企图给予应有的反击。
    美帝国主义如果再挑起战争，它将自取灭亡。
    洪命熹最后领导群众高呼：“美帝国主义从台湾滚出去，从南朝鲜滚出去。”这时，广场上三十多万只拳头一起举了起来，愤怒的吼声响彻云霄。
    接着，有工人、农民、学生、文化艺术界代表在会上讲话。他们一致斥责美帝国主义在台湾海峡的挑衅行为，并且表示要同中国人民一道进行反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争。
    中国驻朝鲜大使馆临时代办曹克强在大会上讲话说，朝鲜人民对中国人民的坚决支持，将更加鼓舞中国人民的斗争意志。他说，中朝两国人民是同美国侵略军队较量过的，美帝国主义如果胆敢进行军事冒险，它和它的走狗们必将遭到更加惨重的失败。
    大会最后通过决议，表示完全支持共和国政府发表的支持周恩来总理关于台湾海峡地区局势声明的声明。
    决议说，中国人民解放台湾，是中国人民的内政问题，是中国人民的神圣不可侵犯的权利，朝鲜人民对美帝国主义侵略者对中国人民的挑衅决不能置若罔闻，对中国人民的任何挑衅也就是对朝鲜人民的威胁。
    决议要求美帝国主义者立即停止挑衅，从台湾和南朝鲜撤出去。
    参加今天大会的有朝鲜内阁副首相金一、郑一龙、郑准泽，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长金昌满，内阁各相和劳动党中央各部部长，各民主政党、社会团体负责人，人民军高级将领和劳动英雄、生产革新者等。
