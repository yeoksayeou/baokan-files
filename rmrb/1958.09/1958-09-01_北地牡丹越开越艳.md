Leap Forward in the Northeast

    Speaking of peonies, one would think of many classical literary works; but speaking of Mudanjiang—Mudanjiang City or Mudanjiang Prefecture, perhaps one would think of some geographical concepts: This is a place on the northeastern border of our motherland, named because the Mudan River flows through it. This is a place with many mountains, but also not lacking water, but within a year, the frost-free period is only a hundred and several dozen days.
    Due to the former association, we usually have rich and warm feelings; due to the latter association, we usually have majestic and solemn feelings.
    However, today if you go to the real Mudanjiang, these two feelings will combine.
    From the word "peony," I think of the following two sentences from the first act of "Romance of the West Chamber": "It nourishes thousands of flowers in Luoyang and irrigates tens of thousands of hectares of fields in Liangyuan." I want to use these two sentences to give to today's Mudanjiang City and Mudanjiang Prefecture. However, there should also be a comment. These two sentences in the first act of "Romance of the West Chamber" describe the Yellow River, that is to say, it is the Yellow River that nourishes thousands of flowers and irrigates tens of thousands of hectares of fields. Here, the "tens of thousands of hectares of fields" that I borrow naturally refer to agriculture, while the "thousands of flowers" refer to industry, and what nourishes them is not the Mudan River, but the Party's general line for building socialism!
    Today's Mudanjiang City was formerly named "Huanghuadianzi"; from this old name, it is not difficult to imagine that this place was once a place where "the grass is low and cattle and sheep are visible when the wind blows." Mudanjiang's industry began after liberation.
    It is said that there are thousands of kinds of peonies. This is the poet's poetic writing. Does Mudanjiang's industry (let's not use poetic writing here) now have thousands of kinds? I dare say that under the great leap forward situation of communes running industries, it must have exceeded thousands long ago. Let's not go into details about this for the time being. Here, let's single out a large and always regarded as "mysterious" item to talk about. This is a flower newly opened in Mudanjiang illuminated by the general line. This is the Mudanjiang artificial petroleum plant built in forty days.
    The petroleum industry is a new undertaking in our country. The mysterious concept of the petroleum industry is quite strong. Mudanjiang City discovered that oil shale reserves are abundant (the reserves within a radius of more than 100 kilometers are at least 200 million tons), and the grade is high (oil content is about 13%), it has been five years, however, once the light of the general line liberates the mind, according to the principle of learning, designing, mining, and building at the same time, a petroleum plant can be built in forty days, which is one of the many miracles since the Great Leap Forward in the country.
    That's right, this is a miracle, but it is not mysterious. Let's see how it was done.
    From April 15th this year, four armies have been advancing side by side. These four armies are: first, the mining of oil shale, second, the construction of dry distillation piles (the foundation project of the petroleum plant), third, the installation project, and fourth, the production of major equipment. These four armies can be said to be fighting empty-handed. What to do if there are no technicians? Invite some, send out a batch, learn while doing, do while learning. In particular, the workers' inventions and innovations have promoted technological innovation and ensured the timely completion of the project. For example, for the seepage guide pipes under the oil shale pile (this is one of the main equipment), 32 pipes require a total of 780,000 holes to be drilled. If the work is done with a drilling machine with one drill bit according to the original routine, one machine tool will take more than 700 days. Moreover, the number of drilling machines in the machine factory in Mudanjiang City is not large, and even if it exerts all its strength, it will not be able to keep up with the needs. At this time, the workers devised methods to improve the machine tool. First, veteran workers Ding Ancong, Wang Zhenyuan, and others created a machine tool with six drill bits; soon, Zhao Fuchen, Sun Peiqi, and others created one with eight drill bits, and finally, one with ten drill bits. In this way, the task was completed in time. Another example is washing towers and cooling towers, which are usually built with bricks, but they changed to using old steel plates, and the construction time of the towers was shortened by half.
    What to do if there are no materials? Excavate and utilize waste and old materials. Here, the spirit of cooperation of brother factories (enterprises) should be greatly praised, they tried their best to support, and gave whatever they had. They not only supported materials, but also supported equipment. Therefore, most of the materials for this newly built petroleum plant were made by using waste and old materials in the warehouses of brother factories, and even using old oil drums from waste product collection stations to weld two chimneys 20 meters high; most of the equipment was either transferred from brother factories or modified with ready-made goods.
    Therefore, if someone asks us how to achieve more, faster, better, and more economically, I think the establishment of this petroleum plant is a good example.
    The key to being able to achieve more, faster, better, and more economically lies in putting politics in command, relying on the masses, going all out, breaking superstitions, giving full play to creativity, and improving the spirit of cooperation.
    The current annual output of this factory is 5,000 tons, and it is planned to reach 30,000 tons in 1959 and 50,000 tons in 1960. Mudanjiang City also plans to build a new factory in 1959 with an annual output of 100,000 tons. In 1960, a third factory will be built with an annual output of 50,000 tons. There are also plans to build a new factory with an annual output of 100,000 tons in areas with abundant oil shale reserves. This is placed in the 1961 plan. Based on this current plan alone, by 1962, the Mudanjiang area will be able to produce 300,000 to 350,000 tons of petroleum annually. It will be a new petroleum industry base in our country. However, time will prove that such an estimate must be conservative. Because the enthusiasm of the local authorities and the energy of the masses must be calculated geometrically.

### 北地牡丹越开越艳

专栏：

    跃进中的东北
　　北地牡丹越开越艳
    茅盾
    提起牡丹，便会联想到不少的古典文学作品；但是提起牡丹江——牡丹江市或牡丹江专区，也许会想到这样一些地理上的概念：这是我们祖国东北边境的一个地方，因为有牡丹江流过境内而得名，这是个多山、但也不缺水的地方，可是一年之内，无霜期不过百数十天而已。
    由于前者的联想，我们通常会发生丰富温馨的感觉；由于后者的联想，我们又通常会发生雄伟肃穆的感觉。
    但是，今天你如果到了现实的牡丹江，这两种感觉便结合起来了。
    从牡丹二字我想起“西厢记”第一折有这样两句：“滋洛阳千种花，润梁园万顷田”。我要借用这两句赠给今天的牡丹江市和牡丹江专区。不过，也应该来个注释。“西厢记”第一折这两句是描写黄河的，就是说，滋了千种花，润了万顷田的，是黄河。我在这里，借用的“万顷田”，当然指农业，而“千种花”呢，却指工业，而滋之润之者，却不是那条牡丹江，而是党的建设社会主义的总路线！
    今天的牡丹江市，旧名“黄花甸子”；从这旧名便不难想到从前这个地方是“风吹草低见牛羊”的去处。牡丹江之有工业，是解放后开始的。
    据说牡丹有千种。这是诗人的诗笔。牡丹江的工业（这里让我们不用诗笔罢），现在满不满千种呢？我敢说，在社社办工业的大跃进形势下，一定早已超过了千种了。这姑且不去细说。这里单拣大的、而且一向被视为“神秘”的一项来说一说。这是总路线照在牡丹江新开放的一朵花。这就是用四十天时间建设起来的牡丹江人造石油厂。
    石油工业在我国是一项新事业。对于石油工业的神秘观念，相当浓厚。牡丹江市发现油母页岩储藏丰富（方圆百余公里储量最低有二亿吨），品位高（含油率在13％左右），总有五年了，然而，一旦总路线的光芒解放了思想，按照边学习、边设计、边开矿、边建设的原则，可就在四十天内建起一座石油厂，这是全国大跃进以来许多奇迹之一。
    不错，这是奇迹，但并不神秘。让我们看看到底是怎样搞起来的。
    从今年4月15日开始，就是四路大军齐头并进。这四路大军，一是油母页岩矿的开采，二是干馏堆（石油厂的基础工程）的建设，三是安装工程，四是主要设备的制作。这四路大军，可以说都是赤手作战的。没有技术人员怎么办？请来一些，派出去一批，边学边做，边做边学。特别是工人们的创造发明，推进了技术革新，保证了工程的及时完成。例如油母页岩堆下的渗导管（这是主要设备之一），三十二根管子共得钻孔七十八万个。如果照本来的常规，一个钻头的钻孔机来做这个工作，一台机床要做七百多天。而且牡丹江市的机器厂的钻孔机数量不多，即使发挥全力，也赶不上需要。在这当儿，工人同志们就设法改进机床。首先是老工人丁安崇、王振远等创造了六个钻头的机床；不久，赵福臣、孙佩奇等又创造了八个钻头的，最后，是十个钻头。这样，及时完成了任务。又如洗涤塔和冷却塔，照常规是用砖砌的，可是他们改用了旧钢板，建塔的时间就缩短了一半。
    材料没有怎么办？挖掘和利用废旧的材料。这里，兄弟厂（企业）的协作精神是应当大书特书的，他们尽力支援，有什么出什么。不但支援了材料，还支援了设备。因此，这座新建的石油厂，从材料来说，大部分是利用了兄弟厂仓库里的废旧材料，甚至利用了废品收购站的旧油桶，焊接成二十公尺高的烟囱两个；从设备来说，大部分又是兄弟厂匀出来的或者用现成货改装的。
    所以，如果有人问我们怎样地多快好省。我想，这个石油厂的建立就是一个好例子。
    而所以能够做到多快好省，其关键在于政治挂帅，依靠群众，鼓足干劲，破除迷信，发挥创造性，提高协作精神。
    这个厂现在年产量是五千吨，计划到1959年年产量可达三万吨，到1960年是五万吨。牡丹江市还计划在1959年新建一厂，年产十万吨。1960年将新建第三座，年产五万吨。还计划在油母页岩储藏丰富的地区也建一座年产十万吨的新厂。这是放在1961年的规划。光照这个现在的计划，到1962年，牡丹江地区就能年产石油三十至三十五万吨。它将是我国的一个新的石油工业基地。然而，时间将证明这样的估计一定是保守的。因为，地方的积极性、群众的干劲，是必须用几何级数来计算的。　　　（本节未完）
