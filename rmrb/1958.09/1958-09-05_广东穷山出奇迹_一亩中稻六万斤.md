Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th – Reporter Zhou Fangyang reports: A high-yield “satellite” of intermediate rice, breaking the 60,000 jin per mu mark in production, has risen from the relatively barren northern mountainous region of Guangdong Province. This is from 1.073 mu of intermediate rice in Tianbei Cooperative, Xingzi Township, Lian County, which produced a total of 64,849 jin and 2.6 liang of dry grain, averaging over 60,437 jin of dry grain per mu.

The creators of this "satellite" are Tu Mingfang, secretary of the Tianbei Cooperative Branch of the Chinese Communist Party and director of the cooperative; Huang Mengchang, deputy director; He Jingliang, captain of the youth shock brigade; Huang Xinkuan, deputy captain; and 198 members of the youth shock brigade.

Tianbei Cooperative is located in the continuous and steep mountains of the Nanling Mountains, with a cold climate, relatively barren soil, and a short frost-free period, and in the past only grew one crop of intermediate rice. In mid-July this year, inspired by the continuous high-yield "satellites" released from early rice across the country, the cooperative decided to conduct high-yield rice experiments, while also trying to gain time to grow another crop of autumn sweet potatoes. Under the initiative and leadership of the branch, the cooperative organized a youth shock brigade and decided to concentrate the rice seedlings that had headed in a field in Jingmu'ao, covering 62.2 mu, for the highest degree of close planting. Before close planting, the field was deeply plowed one chi deep, and 8,000 jin of base fertilizer, pond mud, turf mud, and green manure were applied, along with 500 dan of cow manure, mixed with the soil, and then 10 dan of tea bran and 30 dan of grass ash were applied. Then, on July 18, the highest degree of concentrated close planting was implemented, with a total of more than 800,000 seedlings, more than 10 million plants, transplanted into the entire field. Subsequently, they made tremendous efforts in ventilation, water delivery, top dressing, and pest control of the paddy field. On the morning of August 30, harvesting of this field began. More than 300 members of the youth shock brigade and cooperative members worked hard for two days and one night to complete the harvest on the afternoon of the 31st. Those who attended the acceptance on site included Zhang Gensheng, Secretary-General of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; Zuo Ming, First Secretary of the Shaoguan Prefectural Party Committee; Xu Wenming, First Secretary of the Lian County Party Committee; as well as Xie Huanting, Deputy Chief Agronomist of the Provincial Department of Agriculture; Wu Zhuonian, Associate Professor of South China Agricultural College; Chen Weiqin, Associate Researcher of the South China Agricultural Research Institute, and other scientific and technical personnel.

On the evening of September 3, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee sent a joint congratulatory telegram to the people of Tianbei Cooperative, praising their revolutionary spirit of breaking superstitions and bold experimentation.

　　广东穷山出奇迹
　　一亩中稻六万斤
    据新华社广州4日电　记者周方暘报道：我国一颗突破亩产六万斤大关的中稻高产“卫星”，从广东省比较贫瘠的北部山区升起来了。这是连县星子乡田北社的一点零七三亩中稻，共产干谷六万四千八百四十九斤二两六，平均亩产干谷六万零四百三十七斤多。
    这颗“卫星”的创造者，是中共田北社支部书记兼社主任涂明芳、副主任黄孟常、青年突击队队长何经亮、副队长黄信宽和一百九十八名青年突击队员。
    田北社位于南岭山脉的丛山峻岭之中，气候寒冷，土壤比较贫瘠，无霜期比较短，过去只种一造中稻。今年7月中旬，这个社在全国各地早稻不断放出高产“卫星”的鼓舞下，决定进行水稻高产试验，同时也想争取时间多种一造秋薯。在支部倡议和领导下，这个社组织了青年突击队，决定在敬母坳一块田中，把六十二亩二分田抽穗的禾苗集中进行最高度的密植。密植前先深耕一尺，施下基肥塘泥、草皮泥和绿肥等八千斤，牛栏粪五百担，和泥土拌匀又施茶麸十担，草木灰三十担。然后在7月18日实行最高度的集中密植，整块田共插下禾苗八十多万兜，一千多万株。随后，他们对稻田的通风、送水、追肥、除虫作了巨大的努力。8月30日上午，这块田开始收割。三百多个青年突击队员和社员们猛干了两天一夜，才在31日下午收割完毕。到现场参加验收的，有中共广东省委秘书长张根生、韶关地委第一书记左铭、连县县委第一书记许文明，还有省农业厅副总农艺师谢焕庭、华南农学院副教授吴灼年、华南农业研究所副研究员陈伟钦等科学技术人员。
    9月3日晚，中共广东省委员会和广东省人民委员会向田北社的人民发出联合贺电，赞扬他们破除迷信和大胆试验的革命精神。
