    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 21st: Over 50,000 herder and farmer households in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu Province have recently joined the People's Communes with great joy. As of now, a total of 65 People's Communes have been established throughout the prefecture, achieving complete communization.
    The prefecture achieved agricultural cooperativization in agricultural areas in the winter of 1955. Subsequently, a number of pastoral cooperatives were established on the vast grasslands on a trial basis. Since July this year, when Chairman Mao's instructions on the goodness of the People's Communes, after his inspection in rural areas such as Hebei, were published in the newspapers, the entire grassland has been abuzz. Herdsmen in Maqu County unanimously requested to skip the pastoral cooperatives and directly establish communes; herdsmen in Xicang, Luqu County, wrote more than 100 applications and letters of determination to join the commune in six hours. Li Qiming and three other young men rode their horses 200 li overnight, traveling to every village in Xicang to report the good news to the herdsmen and farmers. Herdsmen in Nayi Township, Xiahe County, drew a sun on a big-character poster and wrote the poem "Chairman Mao is like a brilliant sun, illuminating the growth of all things, and a hundred flowers bloom," firmly demanding to take the socialist road. The enthusiasm and initiative of the masses in agricultural areas to establish communes has also been unprecedentedly high.
    After discussing and studying the ideological dynamics of the herdsmen and farmers throughout the prefecture, the Gannan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to vigorously establish communes. This further encouraged the confidence and production enthusiasm of the vast numbers of herdsmen and farmers to establish communes.
    Since late August, herdsmen and farmers in various places have gathered to celebrate the establishment of communes. On this joyous day, herdsmen in various places danced and sang, celebrating the birth of the People's Commune.

    五万多户农牧民载歌载舞集会庆祝
    甘南藏族自治州公社化
    据新华社兰州21日电　甘肃省甘南藏族自治州五万余户牧民和农民，最近都欢欣鼓舞地加入了人民公社。至此，全州共建立人民公社六十五个，全部实现人民公社化。
    全州在1955年冬季，即在农业区实现了农业合作化。接着，又在广阔的草原上试办了一批牧业合作社。今年7月以来，当毛主席在河北等农村视察提出人民公社好的指示在报上公布后，整个草原都沸腾起来了。玛曲县牧民一致要求跨过牧业社，直接办公社；碌曲县西仓的牧民，六小时就写了要求入公社的申请书和决心书一百多份。黎启明等四个小伙子，跨上骏马一夜跑了二百里，跑遍西仓的每个村子，向牧民、农民报告喜讯。夏河县那义乡牧民，在大字报上画上太阳，并写着“毛主席像灿烂的太阳，照耀着万物生长，百花齐放”的诗句，坚决要求走社会主义道路。农业地区群众要求建立公社的热情和积极性也是空前高涨。
    中共甘南州委讨论研究全州牧民和农民的思想动态后，决定大办公社。这更进一步鼓舞了广大牧民、农民要求建立公社的信心和生产积极性。
    从8月下旬以来，各地牧民和农民都分别集会，庆祝公社成立。在这个大喜的日子里，各地牧民都跳舞唱歌，欢庆人民公社的诞生。
