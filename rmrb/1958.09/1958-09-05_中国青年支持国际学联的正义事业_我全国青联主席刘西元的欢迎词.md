Dear friends, dear guests:

　　In this crisp autumn season, the Fifth Congress of the International Union of Students has officially opened. This congress is being held in our capital, Beijing, bringing us joy and encouragement. On behalf of the All-China Youth Federation and all Chinese youth, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the congress and a warm welcome to the friends from various countries attending the congress.

　　The International Union of Students has traveled a glorious road for twelve years. It has always held high the banners of peace, democracy, national independence, and social progress, the banners against war, against colonialism, and against imperialism, and the banners of safeguarding students' rights in political, economic, cultural, and social aspects. It has done much outstanding work in all these just causes. It is the only international student organization in the world today striving for these noble goals. It is an important force in the world peace movement. We Chinese youth have always steadfastly supported this just cause of the International Union of Students and students from all countries.

　　Friends all know that China was once a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, and our nation lived under oppression and enslavement for a long time. However, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people waged unyielding struggles, finally drove away the imperialist aggressors, overthrew the rule of domestic reactionaries, and won the great victory of the people's revolution. After liberation, our people launched new and great struggles in order to rapidly develop our national economy and culture and build our country into a great socialist country with a modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Now, our socialist construction has achieved great successes. We have not forgotten that these victories and achievements are inseparable from the support of all just forces in the international arena. We express our heartfelt gratitude to all friends who sympathize with and support the cause of our people.

　　Chinese youth have always opposed imperialist aggression and loved peace, and harbor sincere and deep friendship towards friends from all countries. We have always regarded safeguarding peace and seeking friendship as our sacred and noble duty. We have always believed that the struggle of the Chinese people is part of the common cause of the people of the world, and the just struggle of the people and youth students of all countries is also our own cause. We Chinese youth must join hands more closely with friends from all countries and advance side by side in the great cause of striving for peace, democracy, national independence, and social progress!

　　We welcome the student representatives from socialist countries! The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is a strong fortress for defending world peace and a powerful pillar for the cause of human progress. Our fraternal unity is growing stronger day by day. Let us learn from each other better and make greater contributions to advancing our common cause!

　　We welcome the student representatives from various neighboring countries in Asia! We have forged close friendships in the anti-colonialist struggle. Let us, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, cooperate in a friendly manner forever and strive to develop our respective national economies and cultures!

　　We welcome the student representatives from Arab countries who are standing at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle. We welcome our Iraqi friends who have recently achieved a great victory in the national independence movement, and our friends from Lebanon and Jordan who are struggling arduously against the aggression of British and American imperialism! Your heroic and just struggle to safeguard national interests has inspired the struggle of students in all oppressed countries. We once again express our full support for our Arab brothers here!

　　We welcome the student representatives from African countries who are carrying out arduous anti-colonialist struggles, especially our friends from Algeria and Cameroon who are waging heroic struggles to achieve national independence! The day is coming when the African people will break free from the shackles of imperialism and control their own destiny! In your just cause, Chinese youth will always stand with you!

　　We welcome the student representatives from countries in distant Latin America. Although your countries are far from Beijing, our hearts are linked with yours. Your struggle against imperialism and for peace, democracy, and national independence will surely be victorious, and your struggle will always receive support from the Chinese people and youth.

　　We welcome the student representatives from countries in Western Europe, North America, and Australia! We and you share the common aspiration of striving for peace and developing friendship. We are willing to strive to develop our friendly ties. Let us work together for the cause of peace and friendship!

　　Friends! Your visit to our country comes at a time when our socialist construction is developing by leaps and bounds. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, our industry, agriculture, and cultural and educational undertakings are advancing at a high speed in an all-round way. The enthusiasm and creativity of the liberated masses are immeasurably great. The Chinese people are full of confidence that they will catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in a short period of time. While building our motherland, the Chinese people have never forgotten that American imperialism is still occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan. The Chinese people will surely be able to liberate Taiwan. The Chinese people have full confidence and strength to defeat any provocation by American imperialism.

　　Friends, we hope you have a pleasant stay in our country, good health, and a successful conference. We also welcome you to visit various parts of our country to learn about the state of our construction in all aspects and to understand the study, work, and life of our youth and students. There are still many difficulties and shortcomings in our construction work, and we sincerely welcome friends to offer valuable criticisms and opinions.

　　Dear friends! The era we live in today is the era of the great people. Chinese youth firmly believe that our cause is a just cause, and a just cause cannot be destroyed by any force. Let us unite more closely and strive together for lasting world peace and human progress!

　　Long live the friendship between the youth and students of all countries!

　　Long live world peace! (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　中国青年支持国际学联的正义事业
    我全国青联主席刘西元的欢迎词
　　亲爱的朋友们，亲爱的来宾们：
    在这秋高气爽的时节，国际学生联合会第五届代表大会正式开幕了。这一届代表大会在我国首都北京举行，给我们带来了欢欣和鼓舞。我代表中华全国青年联合会和全中国青年，向大会致以衷心的祝贺，向参加大会的各国朋友们表示热烈的欢迎。
    国际学联已经走过了十二年的光荣道路。它始终高举着和平、民主、民族独立和社会进步的旗帜，高举着反对战争、反对殖民主义和反对帝国主义的旗帜，高举着在政治、经济、文化和社会多方面维护学生权利的旗帜，在这一切正义事业方面做了许多卓越的工作。它是现今世界上为这一切崇高目的而奋斗的唯一的国际学生组织。它是世界和平运动中的一支重要的力量。对于国际学联和各国学生的这种正义的事业，我们中国青年始终不渝地给予坚决的支持。
    朋友们都知道，中国曾经是一个半殖民地半封建的国家，我们的民族长期过着被压迫被奴役的生活。但是，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，进行了不屈不挠的斗争，终于赶走了帝国主义侵略者，推翻了国内反动派的统治，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利。解放后，我国人民又展开了新的巨大的斗争，以便迅速发展我们的民族经济和文化，把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。现在，我国的社会主义建设已获得了伟大的成就。我们不曾忘记，这些胜利和成就是同国际上一切正义力量的支援分不开的。我们对一切同情和支持我国人民事业的朋友们表示衷心的感谢。
    中国青年一贯反对帝国主义的侵略和热爱和平，对各国朋友怀着真挚而深厚的友谊。我们一向把保卫和平和寻求友谊看作是自己神圣崇高的职责。我们从来就认为，中国人民的斗争是全世界人民共同事业的一部分，各国人民和青年学生的正义斗争也就是我们自己的事业。我们中国青年，一定要同各国朋友更紧密地携起手来，在争取和平、民主、民族独立和社会进步的伟大事业中并肩前进！
    我们欢迎社会主义各国的学生代表们！以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒，是人类进步事业的有力支柱。我们之间的兄弟般的团结正在日益加强。让我们更好地互相学习，为推进我们的共同事业作出更大的贡献！
    我们欢迎来自亚洲各个近邻国家的学生代表们！我们在反殖民主义斗争中结成了亲密的朋友。让我们在和平共处五项原则的基础上，永远友好合作，为发展各自的民族经济和文化而努力！
    我们欢迎来自站在反帝国主义斗争最前线的阿拉伯各国的学生代表们，我们欢迎最近取得了民族独立运动伟大胜利的伊拉克朋友们，和正在艰苦斗争、反对美英帝国主义侵略的黎巴嫩和约旦的朋友们！你们为维护民族利益所作的英勇的正义的斗争，鼓舞了一切被压迫国家学生的斗争。我们在这里再一次表示我们对阿拉伯兄弟的全力支持！
    我们欢迎来自艰苦地进行反殖民主义斗争的非洲各国的学生代表们，特别是正在进行英勇斗争以求得民族独立的阿尔及利亚和喀麦隆的朋友们！非洲人民摆脱帝国主义的枷锁、掌握自己的命运的日子已经到来了！在你们的正义事业中，永远有中国青年同你们站在一起！
    我们欢迎来自遥远的拉丁美洲各国的学生代表们，你们国家虽然离北京很远，但是我们的心和你们的心是连在一起的。你们反对帝国主义，为和平、民主和民族独立的斗争，一定会取得胜利，你们的斗争永远会得到来自中国人民和青年的支持。
    我们欢迎来自西欧、北美和澳洲各国的学生代表们！我们和你们具有争取和平和发展友好的共同愿望。我们愿意努力发展我们之间的友好联系。让我们为和平和友谊的事业共同努力！
    朋友们！你们来到我国的时候，正是我国的社会主义建设事业飞跃发展的时候。在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，我们的工业、农业、文化教育事业正在全面地高速度前进。解放了的人民群众的积极性和创造力是无比伟大的。中国人民满怀信心，要在短时期里，在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国。在建设我们祖国的同时，我国人民始终没有忘记美国帝国主义还霸占着我国神圣的领土台湾，中国人民一定能解放台湾。中国人民有充分的信心和力量击败美国帝国主义的任何挑衅。
    朋友们，我们希望你们在我国逗留期间生活愉快，身体健康，顺利地开好会议，同时也欢迎大家到我国各地参观，了解我国各方面的建设状况，了解我国青年和学生的学习、工作和生活。在我们的建设工作中还有不少的困难和缺点，我们诚恳地欢迎朋友们提出宝贵的批评和意见。
    亲爱的朋友们！我们今天所处的时代，是伟大的人民的时代。中国青年深信，我们的事业是正义的事业，正义的事业是任何力量也摧毁不了的。让我们更紧密地团结起来，为了争取世界的持久和平和人类的进步而共同奋斗！
    各国青年和学生的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！　（据新华社）
