Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 7th: The 600,000 people of Fuzhou City, situated on the frontline of coastal defense, have quickly mobilized to fight for the thorough crushing of the military provocations of American imperialism.

Last night, after the people of the city heard Premier Zhou's statement, many people stayed up all night, holding protest rallies throughout the night. This morning, 50,000 people, holding large banners with slogans such as "American troops get out of Taiwan!", poured into the main streets of Fuzhou from all directions to hold demonstrations. When more than 4,000 teachers and students from Fujian Normal University walked to the area where American-made Chiang planes committed heinous crimes when they bombed Fuzhou on January 20, 1955, they constantly raised their fists and shouted angrily, "Blood debts must be repaid with blood!" Lian Shenggong, a young industrialist and businessman who was crippled by American-Chiang planes in 1955, said angrily that American imperialism could wound my body with planes and cannons, but it could not destroy the iron will of us Chinese people to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan.

This morning, the broad masses of peasants in the suburbs of Fuzhou held rallies and demonstrations in villages and fields. The men and women members of the Gushan People's Commune and the armed militia gathered in the commune's square. Zheng Yimu, the director of the commune and a national model worker, issued an order at the meeting in her capacity as the head of the commune's militia regiment, saying that all ordinary and basic militiamen, while doing a good job in production, must seize all spare time to step up military training, be ready to heed the call of the motherland at any time, and actively support the struggle to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Coastal Defense Front, 7th: The people of Xiamen City, the heroic city on the coastal defense front, resolutely support the statement issued by Premier Zhou Enlai on behalf of the Chinese government regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait, and strongly protest the war provocations of American imperialism against our country.

Chen Shaokuan, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Deputy Governor of Fujian Province, who is currently inspecting Xiamen, said that American imperialism's expansion of its scope of aggression in the Taiwan Strait seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world. All Chinese people resolutely oppose this provocative behavior of American imperialism. We must liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands; no imperialist aggressor can stop us.

Huang Liancheng, Chairman of the Trade Union of the Xiamen Shipping Administration Bureau, said that the shameless intimidation of American imperialism can only arouse our greater anger. The seamen on the Xiamen front will resolutely and fully support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and the enemy-occupied coastal islands.

Lin Qingquan, the militia platoon leader of Qianpu Village, Hecuo Township, Xiamen Front, said that no matter what means American imperialism uses, it cannot shake our determination to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu.

Ruan Tuan, director of the Xiamen Residents Association, said: The broad masses of fishermen in the Xiamen area are determined to contribute all their strength and are prepared to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands at any time.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 6th: The people of the frontline villages of the Xiamen Front are fully supporting the artillery units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in their efforts to strike at the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous troops entrenched on Jinmen Island.

After the frontline artillery units launched a strong artillery counterattack against the Chiang troops on Jinmen Island, the people of the frontline villages immediately mobilized to help the troops transport ammunition and build fortifications. Some people even voluntarily dismantled stones from their houses destroyed by Chiang's artillery fire and sent them to the troops to build fortifications. They said: "After eliminating the Chiang bandit troops and running the people's communes well, we will build new buildings." The women of the frontline villages also went to the front like men, boiling water and washing clothes for the soldiers.

In the battle, the Young Pioneers were also very active. In one artillery battle, the telephone line of a certain unit was cut off by enemy artillery fire. But before the telephone operator could find the location of the break, the telephone was suddenly connected again. It turned out that He Danian and three other elementary school students in their teens had connected it. He Danian and others usually learned the technique of connecting lines from the telephone soldiers. Once there was an artillery battle, they automatically patrolled and inspected along the telephone lines, and connected them when they saw them broken.

The people of the frontline villages also provided a large amount of pork, vegetables, and other supplies to support the frontline troops. Recently, each village also sent representatives, carrying peanuts, taro, and eggs produced by themselves to the frontline positions to comfort the soldiers.

　　福建军民同仇敌忾誓歼蒋军
    据新华社福州7日电　处在海防前线的福州市六十多万人民，已经迅速动员起来，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义的军事挑衅而斗争。
    昨天晚上，全市人民听到周总理的声明以后，不少人整夜未眠，通宵举行抗议集会。今日凌晨，有五万人高举着“美国军队从台湾滚出去！”等大幅标语，从四面八方涌向福州各主要街道举行游行示威。福建师范学院四千多名师生走到美制蒋机在1955年1月20日轰炸福州时犯下滔天罪行的地区时，不断地高举起拳头，愤怒地高呼：“血债一定要用血来偿还！”青年工商业者连生宫在1955年被美蒋飞机炸成残废，他愤怒地说，美帝国主义用飞机大炮可以炸伤我的身体，但炸不毁我们中国人民一定解放金门、马祖和解放台湾的钢铁般的决心。
    福州市郊区广大农民今晨在村头和田野里举行集会和示威游行。鼓山人民公社的男女队员们和武装整齐的民兵们在公社的广场上集会，这个公社的社长、全国劳动模范郑依姆以公社民兵团团长的身分在会上发布命令说，各营普通民兵和基本民兵在搞好生产的同时，要利用一切空隙时间抓紧军事训练，随时听候祖国的召唤，积极支援解放金门、马祖和解放台湾的斗争。
    据新华社海防前线7日电　海防前线英雄的城市——厦门市人民坚决拥护周恩来总理代表我国政府发表的关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，严重抗议美帝国主义对我国的战争挑衅。
    正在厦门视察的中国人民保卫世界和平委员会福建省分会主席、福建省副省长陈绍宽说，美帝国主义在台湾海峡扩大侵略范围，严重地威胁着亚洲和世界和平，全中国人民坚决反对美帝国主义的这种挑衅行为。我们一定要解放台湾和沿海岛屿，任何帝国主义侵略者也阻挡不了。
    厦门航运管理局工会主席黄连城说，美帝国主义的无耻恫吓只能激起我们的更大愤怒，厦门前线海员将坚决全力支持人民解放军解放台湾和沿海敌占岛屿。
    厦门前线何厝乡前埔村民兵分队长林清泉说，美帝国主义无论用什么手段都不能动摇我们解放台湾及金门、马祖等沿海岛屿的决心。
    厦门居民协会主任阮团说：厦门地区广大渔民决心贡献出一切力量，准备随时支援解放军解放台湾和沿海岛屿。
    据新华社福建前线6日电　厦门前线前沿村庄的人民全力支援中国人民解放军炮兵部队奋力打击盘踞在金门岛上的蒋介石卖国军队。
    当前线炮兵部队对金门岛上蒋军发起强大炮火反击后，前沿各村庄的人民立即动员起来，帮助部队运送弹药，加修工事。有些群众还自动从自己被蒋军炮火击毁的房屋上拆下石料送给部队加修工事。他们说：“消灭了蒋贼军，办好了人民公社，再盖新的楼房。”前沿村庄的妇女们也和男子一样奔赴前线，为战士们烧开水、洗衣服。
    在战斗中，少先队员们也十分活跃。在一次炮战中，某部队的电话线被敌人的炮火打断了。但是电话员还没有找到断线的地方，电话却又突然通了。原来这是少先队员何大年等四个十多岁的小学生接上的。何大年等平时跟电话兵学会了接线的技术，一遇炮战，就自动沿着电话线巡逻检查，看到打断了就接上。
    各前沿村庄的人民还把大量猪肉、蔬菜等支援前线部队。最近，各村还派出代表，带着自己生产的花生、芋头和鸡蛋等到前沿阵地慰问战士们。
