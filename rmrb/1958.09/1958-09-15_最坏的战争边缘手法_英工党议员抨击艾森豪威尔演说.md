Xinhua News Agency, London, September 12th. U.S. President Eisenhower's speech was fiercely criticized today by Labour MP John Baird. Baird said: "Eisenhower's speech is the worst kind of brinkmanship. The world is now in serious danger of war, and his speech is the most irresponsible speech a politician could make."

Many other Labour MPs also demanded that any suggestion of British support for U.S. military action be rejected and called for Parliament to be recalled to debate the issue.

Hubbard said: "We must speak out loud and clear: Hands off China!" He added: "The entire trade union and labor movement should unite to insist that China be granted its legitimate seat in the United Nations." He suggested that unless the government absolutely denies rumors that Britain will support the United States in the Far East, Parliament must be recalled.

Griffiths said: "If the U.S. government is foolish enough to support Chiang Kai-shek in this way, it must do so alone." He added that the situation is now very serious and he hoped that the Labour Party "Shadow Cabinet" would try to get Parliament recalled.

Woolf pointed out: "No one would support the United States in defending these islands which should belong to China. I am sure that the labor movement is completely opposed to being involved."

Winterbottom demanded that the government make it very clear that its attitude is that Britain will not support the United States in "defending" those islands that Britain considers to be part of mainland China.

Holmes said: "I think Parliament should be recalled to express that we have nothing to do with this threat of war in the Far East. We should not support or participate in any war to 'defend' the coastal islands of China."

George Brown slammed Eisenhower's statement. He said the president was ignoring the obvious facts by claiming that the People's Republic of China was engaged in "aggression" in the Taiwan Strait. Brown said that the president's speech made him feel "baffled: how can the head of such a great power be so out of touch with reality? It makes one shudder to think of the consequences for us all."

Brown said that if the British government does not abandon its support for the dangerous policies of the United States, Labour MPs should demand an emergency session of Parliament.

    最坏的战争边缘手法
    英工党议员抨击艾森豪威尔演说
    新华社伦敦12日电　美国艾森豪威尔的演说今天受到了工党议员约翰·贝尔德的激烈批评。贝尔德说：“艾森豪威尔的演说是最坏的（战争）边缘手法。世界现在处于严重的战争危险之中，他的演说是政治家所能发表的最不负责的演说。”
    其他许多工党议员也要求拒绝关于英国支持美国军事行动的任何主张，并且要求召集议会复会来辩论这个问题。
    哈伯德说：“必须大声疾呼：不准干涉中国。”他又说：“整个工会和劳工运动应该联合起来，坚持要让中国享有在联合国中的合法地位。”他建议，除非政府绝对否认传说英国将在远东支持美国的消息，不然，议会就必须复会。
    格里菲思说：“如果美国政府要这样愚蠢地支持蒋介石，那它就必须单独干。”他又说，情况现在是非常严重，他希望工党“影子内阁”设法使议会复会。
    伍尔夫指出：“没有人会支持美国保卫应当属于中国的这些岛屿。我确信，劳工运动完全反对牵连在内。”
    温特博特姆要求政府十分清楚地表示它的这种态度：英国不会支持美国“保卫”英国认为是中国大陆的一部分的那些岛屿。
    霍姆斯说：我认为，议会应该复会来表示我们同这种在远东的战争威胁没有任何关系。我们不应该支持或参加任何“保卫”中国沿海岛屿的战争。
    乔治·布朗抨击艾森豪威尔的声明。他说这位总统不顾明显的事实，硬说中华人民共和国在台湾海峡进行“侵略活动”。布朗说，总统的演说使他感到“莫名其妙：这样一个大国的首脑怎么会这样不顾现实。在想到这对我们大家充满怎样的后果的时候，使人不寒而栗。”
    布朗说，如果英国政府不放弃支持美国的危险政策，工党议员就应当要求召开议会紧急会议。
