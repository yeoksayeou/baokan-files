Xinjiang Establishes First People's Commune

    (Reported by this newspaper) The first people's commune in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Hongqi (Red Flag) People's Commune, was established on September 4th in Hotan County at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains. On this day, all the men, women, and children of the commune dressed in their best clothes as if celebrating a festival. More than 5,000 Uyghur farmers held a grand celebration for the birth of the people's commune.

    Hotan is an ancient agricultural area, and the majority of the farmers living here are Uyghur.

    The Hongqi People's Commune was formed by merging five agricultural cooperatives in Gujiangbake Township, Hotan County, using the method of combining the township and the commune. The entire commune consists of 1,510 households with a total population of 5,243 people. The establishment of the Hongqi People's Commune is the result of the increased communist consciousness of the farmers in Gujiangbake Township and the great leap forward in production.

    To welcome the birth of the commune, the members were filled with enthusiasm and launched a high tide of production to strive for autumn grain yields surpassing the Yangtze River, to achieve a thousand-jin township in grain production, and to vigorously develop local industries. To achieve electrification this year and mechanization next year, all the commune members raised more than 72,000 yuan in three days to establish local industries. (Tan Feng)

    新疆建立第一个人民公社
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区第一个人民公社——红旗人民公社，9月4日在昆仑山下的和阗县诞生。这一天，全社男女老少像过节一样，打扮得齐齐整整，五千多名维吾尔族农民举行了隆重的人民公社诞生庆祝大会。
    和阗是一个古老的农业区，聚居在这里的农民绝大部分都是维吾尔族。
    红旗人民公社是采取乡社合一的办法，由和阗县古江巴克乡五个农业社合并而成。全社共有一千五百一十户，五千二百四十三人。红旗人民公社的建立，是古江巴克乡农民共产主义觉悟的提高和生产大跃进的结果。
    为了迎接公社的诞生，社员们干劲冲天，掀起了力争秋粮过长江，实现粮食千斤乡，大办地方工业的大生产高潮。为了今年实现电气化，明年实现机械化，全体社员在三天内就筹集出七万二千多元兴办地方工业的资金。　　　　　　　　　（谈风）
