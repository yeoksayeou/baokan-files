Xinhua News Agency, 10th September: A commentary by our correspondent:

　　United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld arrived in Beirut, the Lebanese capital occupied by American aggressors, last night. According to the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly, Hammarskjöld is to make "practical arrangements" to facilitate the withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon. However, just yesterday, US Secretary of State Dulles stated brazenly at a press conference in Washington that "no date" could yet be set for the complete withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon, and that "the time is not ripe to announce any definite plans for a complete withdrawal."

　　The "greeting gift" from the American occupying forces in Lebanon to the UN Secretary-General was an air and amphibious landing exercise held today near Beirut.

　　This is how the American imperialists are openly refusing to implement the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly. The British imperialists, along with the small Hussein dynasty of Jordan, maintained by their bayonets, are also refusing to withdraw troops from Jordan.

　　Twenty days have passed since the United Nations General Assembly Special Emergency Session passed the resolution on promoting the withdrawal of US and British troops. The UN Secretary-General, who was tasked with making "practical arrangements" in this regard immediately, has been visiting the Middle East for nearly two weeks. However, Hammarskjöld's assistant admitted yesterday that there is still "no hope of making practical arrangements to implement the resolution."

　　Hammarskjöld held talks in Cairo and Baghdad with officials from the United Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq. Both Foreign Ministers emphasized that the US and British occupying forces must withdraw. The public in Lebanon and Jordan are also strongly demanding that the invading troops leave.

　　However, the US and British imperialists, disregarding the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly and the demands of the people of the Arab countries, still refuse to withdraw their troops. Moreover, it is important to note with serious concern that the US and Britain are intensifying their preparations for new military provocations in the Middle East.

　　In Lebanon, the US military has recently occupied many important strategic locations. American warships continue to transport large quantities of military equipment, such as tanks and armored vehicles used in desert warfare, to the area. US tank units have blockaded key roads near Beirut and are patrolling day and night around areas controlled by the insurgent people. In the past two weeks, the US military has been conducting a series of airborne, tank, air, and amphibious landing exercises. The United States is plotting to bloodily suppress the Lebanese national independence movement so that Lebanon can become a long-term US military base. The United States is not only using the port of Beirut as a major base for the US Sixth Fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean, but also wants to build Lebanon into an atomic and rocket base.

　　In Jordan, according to a report in Cairo's "People's Daily," Britain recently sent eight warships carrying reinforcements and equipment. The current number of British troops in Jordan has increased to approximately six thousand, not counting the troops on British warships anchored in the Gulf of Aqaba. British aircraft have already carried out barbaric bombings of patriotic positions of the armed uprising east of the Jordan River. British executioners are directly massacring Jordanian patriots. Britain has also recently dispatched four more escort frigates to the Persian Gulf and continues to increase its troops in Muscat, Bahrain, and Sharjah. Britain and the United States have also recently signed a secret agreement with Israel to supply Israel with a large number of offensive weapons.

　　Numerous facts show that the US imperialists, who are frantically carrying out military provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area, are also continuing to conspire with Britain in the Middle East to launch new provocations against the Arab people.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th September: TASS Beirut, 10th September: According to Lebanese newspapers, American troops attempted to enter the Shouf Mountains in northern Lebanon, which are controlled by insurgents. The newspapers pointed out that Lebanese insurgents fired fiercely on American soldiers, forcing them to retreat.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 9th September: The Voice of Free Lebanon radio broadcast a statement on the evening of the 8th by Lebanese youth demanding the immediate withdrawal of the American occupying forces from Lebanon.

　　The statement, published in the Lebanese "New World" newspaper, said: "American troops, go back to your country. We vow that if you do not leave our country immediately, we will not hesitate to take up arms and use all possible means to drive you out by force. You should believe that our beloved Lebanon will be a huge grave to bury you. You and your leaders will bear all the consequences if you stay any longer."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 9th September: "Al-Nour" newspaper published an editorial today condemning the "exercises" held by the American invading army in Lebanon to intimidate the Lebanese people.

　　According to reports, the US imperialist army, while carrying out heinous provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait, the American occupying forces in Lebanon are scheduled to hold air and amphibious exercises near Beirut on the 10th in order to "show" their strength.

　　The "Al-Nour" newspaper's editorial on this matter said that this American military demonstration is one of the characteristics of the "policy of strength" pursued by the United States, the purpose of which is to attempt to intimidate the noble Arab people of Lebanon and to encourage the traitorous Shamun and his ilk to implement their policies of conspiracy, betrayal, provocation, and service to imperialism.

　　The newspaper said that the goal of the Lebanese people and all Arab people is first and foremost to withdraw US troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan.

　　The newspaper warned that the United States should realize that, no matter what happens, the Lebanese people are vigilant and united, and they will never give up the struggle if they do not achieve their main goal of demanding the withdrawal of troops.

    悍然拒绝从黎巴嫩约旦撤军
    美英在中东准备新挑衅
    美军举行演习妄图恫吓黎巴嫩人民
    新华社10日讯　本社记者的述评：
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德昨天晚间到达美国侵略者占领下的黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特。根据联合国大会通过的决议，哈马舍尔德是要去作出促使美军撤出黎巴嫩的“实际安排”。而就在昨天，美国国务卿杜勒斯在华盛顿的记者招待会上蛮横地表示，现在还不能订出美军全部撤出黎巴嫩的“任何日期”，“要宣布任何全部撤退的确定计划，时机还没有成熟”。
    在黎巴嫩当地的美国侵略军队给联合国秘书长的“见面礼”是，今天在贝鲁特附近地区举行空中和两栖登陆演习。
    美帝国主义者就是这样公然地在拒绝执行联合国大会的决议。英帝国主义者也同靠他们刺刀维持着的约旦侯赛因小王朝一起，拒绝从约旦撤军。
    联合国大会特别紧急会议通过关于促使美英军队撤退的决议，已经过去了二十天。受命去立即在这方面作出“实际安排”的联合国秘书长已经在中东访问了近两个星期。但是，哈马舍尔德的助手在昨天承认，现在尚“无望作出执行决议的实际安排”。
    哈马舍尔德到开罗和巴格达同阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克共和国政府人士举行了会谈。两国外交部长都强调指出，美英占领军必须撤退。黎巴嫩和约旦公众也在强烈要求侵略军队滚走。
    然而，美英帝国主义不顾联合国大会的决议，不顾阿拉伯国家人民的要求，仍然拒不撤军。不仅这样，值得严重注意的是，美英还加紧在中东准备着新的军事挑衅。
    在黎巴嫩，美军最近新占领了许多重要战略据点。美国军舰继续在把大批在沙漠地区作战使用的坦克、装甲车等军事装备运到那里。美国坦克部队封锁了贝鲁特附近的交通要道，并且夜以继日在起义人民控制地区周围巡逻。最近两个星期来，美军接连在举行空降、坦克、空中及两栖登陆演习。美国正阴谋血腥地镇压黎巴嫩民族独立运动，以使黎巴嫩长期成为美国的军事基地。美国不仅在把贝鲁特港作为美国第六舰队在东地中海的一个主要基地，而且要把黎巴嫩建成原子基地和火箭基地。
    在约旦，据开罗“人民报”报道，英国最近开去八艘军舰，载着增援部队和装备。目前在约旦的英国军队已增加到六千人左右，停泊在亚喀巴湾的英国军舰上的部队还不计在内。英国飞机已经对约旦河以东地区武装起义的爱国者阵地进行过野蛮的轰炸。英国刽子手已经直接在屠杀着约旦爱国志士。英国最近并且又增派四艘护航快舰去波斯湾，继续增兵马斯喀特、巴林和沙贾。英美最近还同以色列签订了秘密协定，要供给以色列大量进攻用的武器。
    有种种事实表明，疯狂地在台湾海峡地区向中国人民进行军事挑衅的美帝国主义者，也继续在中东地区联合英国阴谋向阿拉伯人民发动新的挑衅。
    新华社10日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特10日讯：据黎巴嫩报纸报道，美国军队企图开进起义者控制的黎巴嫩北部的舒弗山区。报纸指出，黎巴嫩起义者向美国士兵猛烈射击，迫使他们撤退。
    新华社大马士革9日电　自由黎巴嫩之声电台8日晚上广播了黎巴嫩青年要求美国占领军立即从黎巴嫩撤出的声明。
    这项登载在黎巴嫩“新世界报”上的声明说：“美国军队滚回你们的国家去，我们宣誓，如果你们不立即离开我们的国家，我们将毫不犹豫地拿起武器，并且使用一切可能的办法以武力把你们赶出去。你们应当相信，我们可爱的黎巴嫩将是埋葬你们的巨大坟墓。你们和你们的负责人将承担全部后果，如果你们再停留下来的话。”
    据新华社大马士革9日电“光明报”今天发表社论谴责美国侵略军在黎巴嫩举行“演习”，恫吓黎巴嫩人民。
    据报道，美帝国主义军队在台湾海峡对中国人民进行罪恶挑衅的同时，在黎巴嫩的美国占领军预定10日在贝鲁特附近地区举行空中和两栖演习，以便“显示”他们的力量。
    “光明报”就此发表的社论说，美国这种军事示威是美国所奉行的“实力政策”的特点之一，其目的是企图恫吓黎巴嫩的崇高的阿拉伯人民，并且给卖国贼夏蒙之流打气，以便贯彻阴谋、卖国、挑衅和为帝国主义服务的政策。
    这家报纸说，黎巴嫩人民和所有阿拉伯人民的目的首先是要美国军队撤出黎巴嫩和英国军队撤出约旦。
    这家报纸警告说，美国应当认识到，不论发生什么情况，黎巴嫩人民是保持警惕和团结一致的，如果没有达到他们要求撤军的主要目的，他们决不放弃战斗。
