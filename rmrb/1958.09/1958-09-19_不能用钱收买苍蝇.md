Reader's words:

    You Can't Bribe Flies with Money
    The 119 Geological Exploration Team of the North China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau uses the method of buying flies at high prices to mobilize the masses to kill flies. It is understood that fifty flies cost one yuan. One family member sold twelve yuan at one time, a child sold six yuan, and countless others sold several yuan.
    I think the 119 team's method of eliminating the four pests is wrong. At present, our country is concentrating its efforts on construction, and every cent must be used properly, but the 119 team is using the country's money for this, which is a waste.

    不能用钱收买苍蝇
    华北煤田地质勘探局119地质勘探队用高价收买苍蝇的办法来发动群众打苍蝇。据了解：五十个苍蝇一块钱，一个家属一次就卖了十二元，一个小孩卖了六元，其余卖几元的不计其数。
    我认为119队这种除四害办法不对。目前我国正在集中力量进行建设，一分一文都要用得得当，而119队却把国家的钱用在这上面，这是一种浪费的行为。
