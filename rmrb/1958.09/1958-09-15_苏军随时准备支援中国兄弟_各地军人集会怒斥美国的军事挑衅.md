Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th: The provocative behavior of the U.S. imperialists in the Taiwan Strait has aroused the indignation of Soviet soldiers. In recent days, news of Soviet soldiers holding protest rallies has been coming in from various places. At these rallies, they unanimously supported the solemn position expressed by Khrushchev in his letter to Eisenhower, and firmly expressed their determination to stand with the Chinese people against the adventurous actions of the American aggressors.

The ships of the Soviet Northern Fleet, which are about to hold military exercises according to the combat training plan, have successively held rallies. Naval officer Rulev emphasized at a rally that the imperialists should know that the people of the Soviet Union and China are brothers and friends under all circumstances, and the interests of the Soviet Union and China are inextricably linked. The soldiers participating in these rallies expressed their determination to further improve their combat readiness and combat capabilities.

Various units of the Northern Military District also held protest meetings. Officer Laptev of a certain unit said at the meeting that U.S. imperialism is not reconciled to the Chinese people carrying out socialist construction. However, we will always stand with our Chinese brothers.

Commanders and fighters of the Leningrad Naval District also angrily condemned the provocative actions of the U.S. war-mongers at the rally and unanimously supported Khrushchev's letter to Eisenhower.

In southern Soviet Union, officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the North Caucasus Military District held a rally and listened to a report by Captain Mospan, who pointed out that despite repeated warnings from the Chinese government, U.S. imperialism continues to violate China's territorial waters and airspace. He emphasized that the American aggressors must remember: Soviet soldiers and Chinese soldiers are brothers, therefore, we will always support each other.
