New folk art has taken root among the masses
Tao Dun
Of the 167 programs from 27 provinces and cities performed at the First National Folk Art Performance, 79% reflected modern life. Among these, the majority were about the Great Leap Forward in production. When these programs were performed in various places, they played an active role in propaganda and education. It can be said that folk art creation has abandoned the old clichés of talented scholars and beauties, and wandering swordsmen, and has embarked on a new path: to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to serve socialist construction. Folk art creation has reached a new stage of development.

The performance of these new works also shows that new works reflecting reality have taken root among the masses. They were performed at the Chang'an Theater in Beijing for twelve consecutive days, and every performance was full. The audience applauded continuously, and encores were sometimes requested four or five times, forcing the performers to sing again. It can be said that these programs have been approved by the masses, and some can be ranked alongside excellent traditional programs. In addition to the incomparable content compared to traditional programs, they are not inferior to excellent traditional programs in terms of art. These new pieces have both ideological and artistic merit; they are both educational and entertaining. We can cite some programs as examples.

Some programs describe the contrast between the old and new societies, refuting the rightists' slander of "the present is not as good as the past," and enlightening the masses' class consciousness. For example, Han Qixiang's "Turning Over," which he wrote and sang about his own life experience. In the first half of this work, he narrates the tragic scene of his family scattering and fleeing under the oppression of landlords in the old society. He wrote with tears in his eyes, sang with tears in his eyes, and the audience listened with tears in their eyes. He himself said that he used storytelling as bullets to attack the enemy. People who heard him tell stories had their class consciousness enlightened and their fighting will strengthened. When he sang the second half, when he arrived in Yan'an and Beijing and received the affection of Chairman Mao, the joy he expressed gave the audience a very deep impression. Another example is the Hubei Yu Gu "Lost Road," which is a similar work. It is about Liu Jiemei forgetting her roots and turning back. There is a description of Liu Jiemei secretly going to see the exhibition: "Picking up the broken bowl, seeing mother's face: 'If I can eat a bowl of white rice in my lifetime, I will die content.'" Although the lyrics of Hubei Yu Gu have a certain format, this format also conforms to the natural language. Not only does it not make people see the traces of tailoring, but it makes people think that this artistic language is the language of the suffering peasants of that year. When performing, the audience cannot distinguish between singing and crying. These works are high in both ideology and artistry, and are very moving.

Some programs describe the ideological struggle between progressives and conservatives in the Great Leap Forward in production. For example, "Five Thousand One." This is a piece of Xihe Dagu written and performed by Hebei artist Sun Laikui. He wrote about advanced elements engaging in experimental fields for high wheat yields, and some individuals making sarcastic remarks on the sidelines. However, these advanced producers were not discouraged by this and patiently insisted on wheat field management. This work powerfully praised the advanced and criticized the backward. The sections describing the struggle between two kinds of thoughts are full of interest. The description of the wheat growing in the experimental field is also vivid, which cannot but fascinate the audience.

Some programs have also borrowed the traditional romanticism to praise the power of human beings over the power of gods, and the world over heaven. For example, "Dragon King Resigns" and "Overturning Rivers and Seas" belong to this category. This kind of work is lively and interesting, and is welcomed by the masses.

Many programs also grasp the characteristics of folk art and learn the techniques of traditional folk art. For example, "Division Commander Helps in the Kitchen." If you only write about the division commander going to the kitchen, you can only write from the positive side how he can cook and work with the cooks, which will not have much effect on arousing the audience's interest. The author, Gao Yuanjun, etc., skillfully used the techniques of traditional folk art to treat Commander He as the newly arrived cook, He Mingliang, and He Mingliang as Commander He. Using the trick that "He" and "He" have the same pronunciation but different characters, they wrote a vivid and lively story.

The above are just a few programs from this performance. The vast majority of the programs, including the traditional programs, are mostly good. Through these programs, some problems in folk art creation can be explained.

First of all, there is the issue of creating in coordination with political movements. Some writers believe that good works cannot be written in coordination with political movements, and that only some propaganda materials can be written. Judging from the excellent folk art programs seen at this performance, many were written in coordination with political movements. Han Qixiang's "Turning Over" was written to refute the rightists and to cooperate with the anti-rightist movement. Sun Laikui's "Five Thousand One" was written after the wheat harvest to promote increased production. These works cannot be said to be excellent works in folk art. If the author usually throws himself into the actual struggle, is familiar with the situation of this struggle, and contacts the active elements in the struggle, then when the movement arrives, he can immediately write works to cooperate with this movement. If Han Qixiang had not been angered by the rightists, and had not compared the lives of the old and new societies, he would not have been able to refute the rightists so powerfully. If Sun Laikui had not been active in the countryside, how could he have written so vividly about wheat growth and cultivation? People who say that good works cannot be written in coordination with political movements are also saying that they have not gone deep into the struggle, deep into reality, and deep into the masses. How can you write good works if you try hard to write them?

Judging from this performance, the masses like programs with modern content. The previous statement that the masses do not like new programs is untenable. Today's folk art audience is different from the past. In the past, most of the people who listened to stories were idle people with nothing to do. Today's audience are workers, peasants, soldiers, and students. They welcome folk art with new content. The fact also shows that some of the programs that the masses enthusiastically like to listen to today are not traditional programs, but newly created programs.

It is especially worth noting that many of the programs in this performance were created by the artists themselves. Folk art has various forms and its own laws. The works written by our literary and art workers often cannot conform to these storytelling rules. The works written by the artists themselves do not have this shortcoming. Folk art artists are closest to the masses. On the one hand, folk art artists live in the lower levels of society, have suffered various oppressions, and understand the old society. After liberation, their social status has improved, and their lives have improved. They have infinite love for the new society, and their praise of socialism is real. On the other hand, folk art artists are only a few feet away from the audience when they perform. He can directly observe the reaction of the masses when he says a sentence and sings a sentence. They can easily test which sentences in the work the masses like and which the masses hate, and use this to improve. Some storytellers speak directly to the audience in storytelling, so what they write can quickly absorb the opinions of the masses and be tested among the masses. However, artists are still limited in their literary and artistic accomplishments and cultural level. New literary and art workers should cooperate with them, help them, and learn from them. The cooperation between artists and literary and art workers should be strengthened.

If more than 50,000 professional artists across the country pay attention to writing and performing on their own, more works will be produced, more timely, and more in line with current political tasks. Now, in addition to professional artists, there are hundreds of thousands or millions of amateur folk art enthusiasts. They work in factories, rural areas, and the military. They are familiar with the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. If they all pick up pens to write about the new people and new things around them, folk art creation will be more prosperous. Thousands of thousands of folk art works sing socialism in unison, which is a great force for socialist propaganda and education.

    新曲艺在群众中生了根
    陶钝
    第一次全国曲艺会演演出的来自二十七个省市的一百六十七个节目中，反映现代生活的新节目占79％。其中有关生产大跃进的还占了多数。这些节目在各地演唱时，起了积极的宣传教育作用。可以说，曲艺创作已经抛弃了佳人才子、江湖侠客的老套子，走上了新的道路，要为工农兵服务，要为社会主义建设服务。曲艺创作已经到了一个新的发展阶段。
    这些新的作品演出的情况也说明，反映现实的新作品已经在群众中生了根。在北京长安戏院一连演出了十二天，场场满座。场子里掌声不断，谢幕有时达四五次，不得已只好再唱。可以说，这些节目已经是群众批准了的，有的可以和优秀传统的节目并列。除了在内容上和传统节目不可同日而语以外，在艺术上也不比传统优秀节目差。这些新曲目既有思想性也有艺术性；既有教育意义也起了娱乐作用。我们可以举一些节目为例。
    节目中有写新旧社会对比，驳斥了右派的“今不如昔”谰言，启发了群众的阶级觉悟的。例如韩启祥自编自唱自己身世的“翻身记”。在这作品的前半段，叙述他一家人在旧社会地主压迫下四散逃亡悲惨的景象，是含着眼泪写，含着眼泪唱，听众也含着眼泪听。他自己说过，他拿说书当子弹打击敌人，听过他说书的人阶级觉悟受到了启发，斗争意志就加强了。当他唱到后半段，他到了延安和北京，受到毛主席的爱抚时，他那种快慰的情绪也给了听众极深刻的印象。再如湖北渔鼓“迷路记”也是同类的作品。它以刘介梅忘本回头为内容。对刘介梅偷偷地去看了展览会有这样的描写：“拿起打碎的碗，看见娘的脸：‘哪年吃顿白米饭，死了也心甘’。”虽然湖北渔鼓的唱词有一定的格式，但是这格式也符合了语言的自然，不但没有使人看出剪裁的痕迹，反而使人认为这艺术的语言就是当年受苦的农民的语言。当演唱的时候，听众也分不清歌声还是哭声。这些作品思想性和艺术性都是高的，是很感动人的。
    节目中也有写生产大跃进中进步派和保守派的思想斗争的。例如“五千一”。这是河北艺人孙来奎自编自唱的一段西河大鼓。他写先进分子搞小麦丰产的试验田，个别人在旁边说风凉话。可是这先进生产者并没有因此灰心，耐心地坚持小麦田间管理。这作品有力地歌颂了先进，批评了落后。在描写两种思想斗争的段落中，趣味横生。在写试验田中小麦生长的时候也活龙活现，不能不使听众入迷。
    节目中也有借用了传统浪漫主义的手法来歌颂人力大过神力，人间胜过天上的作品。例如“龙王辞职”、“翻江倒海”都属于这一类。这类的作品活泼多趣，受到了群众的欢迎。
    节目中也有许多是掌握了曲艺的特点，学习了传统曲艺的技巧写的。例如“师长帮厨”。要是单写师长下厨房只能从正面写他如何地会做饭做菜和炊事员一起劳动，挑动听众的兴趣的作用不大。作者高元钧等，就纯熟地利用传统曲艺的技巧，把贺师长当作了新来的炊事员何鸣亮，把何鸣亮当作了贺师长。利用“何”“贺”音同字不同这窍门，写出了生动活泼的故事来。
    以上所举不过是这次会演中几个节目，绝大多数节目，连传统节目在内大部分都是好的。通过这些节目可以说明曲艺创作方面的一些问题。
    首先是关于配合政治运动创作的问题。有些作家认为配合政治运动写不出好作品来，只能写一些宣传材料。从这次会演所看到的曲艺优秀节目来看，许多是为了配合政治运动写的。韩起祥的“翻身记”是为了驳斥右派写的，是为了配合反右运动。孙来奎的“五千一”在小麦丰收以后写的，为了宣传增产。这些作品不能不说是曲艺中的优秀作品。要是作者平常就投身在实际斗争中，熟悉这一方面的斗争形势，接触在斗争中的活跃分子，那么运动到了，他马上就可以写出配合这运动的作品来。韩起祥要没有被右派分子激怒，对比了新旧社会的生活，驳斥右派不会那么有力。孙来奎要不是常在农村中活动，哪里能对小麦生长培育写得那么生动。说配合政治运动写不出好作品来的人，也等于说他没有深入斗争，深入实际和深入群众。勉强去写怎能写出好作品来呢？
    从这次会演来看，群众是喜爱现代内容的节目的。从前有人强调群众不喜欢新节目的说法是站不住脚的。今天的曲艺听众，已经和从前不同了。从前听书的有大部是游手好闲无所事事的人，现在的听众是工农兵和学生，他们对新内容的曲艺是欢迎的，事实也说明今天群众所热烈喜欢听的一些曲目，并非传统节目，而是新创作的节目。
    尤其值得注意的是，这次会演节目中有许多是艺人自己创作的。曲艺有多种多样的形式，也有它的规律，我们文艺工作者写的作品常常不能符合这些说唱规律。艺人自己写的就没有这种缺点。曲艺艺人和群众最接近，一方面曲艺艺人是在社会下层中生活，受过各种压迫，了解旧社会。解放以后社会地位提高，生活改善了，他们对于新社会有无限的热爱，他们歌颂社会主义是真实的。另一方面曲艺艺人表演时离听众不过几尺。他说一句唱一句可以直接观察群众的反映。他们很容易试验出作品中的句子哪是群众喜爱，哪是群众厌烦的，借此可以改进。有些说书人在说书中直接同听众讲话，所以他们写的东西能很快地吸收群众意见在群众中考验。不过艺人在文艺修养上，在文化程度上还受到限制。新文艺工作者应该同他们合作，帮助他们，也向他们学习。艺人和文艺工作者的合作应当加强。
    全国五万余职业艺人都注意自编自演，演唱的作品便会生产得更多，更及时，更能配合当前的政治任务。现在除职业艺人之外，还有几十万几百万业余曲艺爱好者，他们工作在工厂、农村和军队中，他们是熟悉工农兵生活的。如果他们都拿起笔来写他们周围的新人新事，曲艺创作便将更加繁荣。千百万篇的曲艺作品齐唱社会主义，这是社会主义宣传教育的很大的力量。
