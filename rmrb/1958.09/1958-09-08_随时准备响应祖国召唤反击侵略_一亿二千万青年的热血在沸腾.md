    Ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland to fight back against aggression
    The blood of 120 million young people is boiling
    (Our Dispatch) The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation issued a statement supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait. The full text is as follows:
    Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, representing our government, issued a statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait. The statement is righteous and fully expresses the firm will of the Chinese people and youth. We express our resolute support. Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times, and Chinese youth have never forgotten that liberating Taiwan is our most sacred duty. Now, American imperialism dares to openly threaten to expand its scope of aggression against our country in the Taiwan Strait and carry out war provocations. New and old hatreds, Chinese youth feel extremely indignant about this!
    American imperialism is flexing its muscles, running rampant and carrying out aggression everywhere in the world. It seems invincible, but the Chinese people have always regarded it as a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, bullying the weak and fearing the strong. Chinese youth deeply understand what methods to use to deal with unreasonable aggressors. Nine years ago, since American imperialism was unable to stop the victory of the Chinese people and had to tuck its tail between its legs and scram from the Chinese mainland; five years ago, since it was beaten by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield and lost its helmets and armor, then, in today's China, where the people are unprecedentedly united and unprecedentedly strong, the American aggressors should not dream of getting any advantage from the Chinese people. Six hundred million Chinese people cannot be intimidated by any atomic blackmail or war threats.
    We solemnly call on the 120 million young people and students across the country to be a hundred times more vigilant and united as one when the enemy frantically threatens the security of the motherland, resolutely implement the resolutions of the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held in Beidaihe, use greater energy to accelerate socialist construction, produce more steel and grain, and further strengthen and consolidate national defense forces; and be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland. If the American warmongers insist on imposing war on our country, as long as Chairman Mao gives an order, we will immediately take up weapons and go to the front line. Our blood is boiling, is burning, in order to defend the motherland, to defend world peace, we will never spare anything of ourselves, wherever the enemy attacks from, we will definitely eliminate him there.

    随时准备响应祖国召唤反击侵略
　　一亿二千万青年的热血在沸腾
    本报讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会发表声明，支持周恩来总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明。全文如下：
    国务院周恩来总理代表我国政府发表的关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明。义正词严，充分地表达了中国人民和青年的坚强意志，我们表示坚决拥护。台湾和澎湖列岛自古就是中国的领土，中国青年一刻也没有忘记解放台湾是我们最神圣的职责。现在美帝国主义竟敢公然威胁要在台湾海峡地区扩大对我国的侵略范围，进行战争挑衅，旧恨新仇，中国青年对此感到无比的愤慨！
    美帝国主义张牙舞爪，横行霸道，在世界上到处进行侵略，看来不可一世，但是中国人民向来就把他看作是外强中干、欺软怕硬的纸老虎。中国青年深深懂得用什么方法来对付蛮横无理的侵略者。九年以前，美帝国主义既然无力阻挡住中国人民的胜利，不得不夹起尾巴从中国大陆上滚蛋；五年以前，又既然被中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜战场上打得丢盔弃甲，那么，在中国人民空前团结和空前强大的今天，美国侵略者更不要梦想从中国人民手里得到任何便宜。六亿中国人民，是任何原子讹诈和战争威胁都吓不倒的。
    我们庄严地号召全国一万万二千万青年和学生，在敌人疯狂地威胁到祖国安全的时候，更要百倍警惕，万众一心，坚决贯彻执行最近在北戴河召开的中国共产党中央政治局扩大会议的决议。用更大的干劲来加速社会主义的建设，生产更多的钢铁和粮食，进一步壮大和巩固国防力量；并且随时准备着响应祖国的召唤，如果美国战争狂人一定要把战争强加于我国，只要毛主席一声令下，我们就会立刻拿起武器，走上前线。我们的热血在沸腾，在燃烧，为着保卫祖国，保卫世界和平，我们绝不吝惜自己的一切，敌人从那里进攻，我们就一定要把他消灭在那里。
