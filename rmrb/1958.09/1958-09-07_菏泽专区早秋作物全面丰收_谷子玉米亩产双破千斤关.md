　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 6th—Heze Prefecture, Shandong, has achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest of early autumn crops, with the average per-mu yield of millet and spring corn both exceeding 1,000 jin.

　　This year, the prefecture planted a total of 1,451,947 mu of millet, with a total output of 1,555,331,000 jin, averaging 1,069 jin per mu. This is an increase of 842 jin per mu compared to the bumper harvest of 1956. The entire region planted a total of 357,696.5 mu of spring corn, with a total output of 399,840,000 jin, averaging over 1,117 jin per mu, an increase of 1,018 jin per mu compared to 1956. Juancheng county's 218,000 mu of millet averaged over 2,000 jin per mu; Juancheng and Cao county's corn averaged 1,500 jin per mu.

　　Heze Prefecture has always been a low-yield area, and in the past, it suffered from natural disasters to varying degrees almost every year. In particular, water and drought disasters seriously threatened agriculture, with an average of about 27% of cultivated land affected each year. In 1956, the year with the highest yield, the average annual yield was only over 224 jin per mu. This year, the wheat yield doubled compared to 1956, and autumn crops have achieved an unprecedented large-scale bumper harvest. The Heze area has achieved such great results because it implemented the Party's General Line and successfully carried out the rectification movement. Last winter and this spring, the Heze Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, with the specific assistance of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, launched a Party-wide and nationwide rectification movement from the Prefectural Committee to the agricultural cooperatives. Through extensive airing of views, debates, and big-character posters, it liquidated localism, criticized a series of right-leaning conservative ideas such as inferiority complexes and "conditionalism" that existed among cadres and the masses, liberated thinking, and boosted morale. Since last winter and this spring, the Prefectural Committee has led millions of people to fight for twenty days and nights, completing 139.51 million cubic meters of earthwork, realizing the field ridges and ditch ridges, and repaired 7.55 million cubic meters of earthwork at any time during the rainy season this year. More than 10,000 pits and small reservoirs have also been dug, thus reversing the situation of being vulnerable to drought and flood disasters. Dianziwa in Dingtao County used to be flooded every year. This year, the 1,200 mu of spring corn planted in the low-lying area averaged 1,070 jin per mu. Xuzhuangwa in Liangshan County had not harvested millet for sixty years, and this year's average yield was 2,500 jin per mu.

    菏泽专区早秋作物全面丰收
　　谷子玉米亩产双破千斤关
    新华社济南6日电　山东菏泽专区早秋作物获得全面大丰收，谷子和春玉米的平均亩产量都突破了一千斤。
    这个专区今年共种谷子一百四十五万一千九百四十七亩，总产量十五亿五千三百三十一万斤，平均亩产一千零六十九斤。这比丰收的1956年每亩增产八百四十二斤。全区共种春玉米三十五万七千六百九十六点五亩，总产量三亿九千九百八十四万斤，平均亩产一千一百一十七斤多，这比1956年每亩增产一千零一十八斤。鄄城二十一万八千亩谷子，平均亩产二千斤多；鄄城和曹县的玉米平均亩产一千五百斤。
    菏泽专区一向是一个低产区，过去几乎年年都要遭受不同程度的自然灾害，尤其是水、旱灾害给农业以严重的威胁，平均每年有27％左右的耕地受灾。产量最高的1956年，全年平均亩产仅二百二十四斤多。而今年小麦产量比1656年翻了一番，秋季作物更获得了空前的大面积丰收。菏泽地区由于贯彻了党的总路线和胜利地进行了整风运动，才取得这样的伟大的成绩的。去冬今春，中共菏泽地委在中共山东省委的具体帮助下，展开了从地委到农业社全党全民性的整风运动，通过大鸣大放大辩论大字报，清算了地方主义，批判了在干部和群众中存在的自卑感、“条件论”等一系列的右倾保守思想，解放了思想，鼓足了干劲。地委从去冬今春以来，曾领导百万群众奋战二十昼夜，完成一亿三千九百五十一万土方，实现了大地畦田和沟洫畦田化，今年雨季又随时补修了七百五十五万土方，还挖了一万多个坑塘和小水库，从而扭转了易受旱涝灾害的局面。定陶县店子洼过去年年受淹，今年在洼地种植的一千二百亩春玉米，平均亩产一千零七十斤。梁山县许庄洼六十年没收过谷子，今年平均亩产二千五百斤。
