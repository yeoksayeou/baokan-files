Xinhua News Agency, September 10th: Soviet public opinion warmly supports the serious warning issued by Khrushchev in his letter to Eisenhower regarding the American aggressors. Today, Moscow newspapers have all published editorials or editorial department articles on this letter, reiterating their warning to U.S. imperialism.

"Pravda" and other newspapers repeatedly quoted Khrushchev's statement in the letter that an encroachment upon China is an encroachment upon the Soviet Union.

The "Pravda" editorial department, under the title "Put Away the Policies of Provocation and Blackmail," severely condemned the U.S. imperialist provocative actions against the Chinese people.

The article stated that the world is extremely indignant about the new provocative activities of the United States in the Far East. After assembling a large number of naval and air combat forces, the American aggressors recently organized landing exercises for U.S. troops and Chiang Kai-shek's troops in southern Taiwan. U.S. warships, disregarding the repeated serious warnings of the government of the People's Republic of China, have also continuously intruded into China's territorial waters. After pointing out this arrogant attitude of U.S. imperialism, the article warned that U.S. imperialists have obviously forgotten that they are dealing with a large country capable of delivering a devastating counterattack.

The article continued that great China is powerful because it has inexhaustible human and material resources. In addition, it has loyal friends who are ready to assist it at any time. The article stated that Khrushchev's letter to the U.S. President clearly illustrates this point.

The article pointed out that the resolute and unambiguous attitude of the Soviet government expressed in Khrushchev's letter is not a threat, but a serious warning to those who sometimes lose their sense of reality due to mad aggressive intentions, thereby creating dangerous situations. Therefore, peace-loving people unanimously support this warning, and far-sighted observers regard the Soviet government leader's letter as a plan for establishing a solid and lasting peace in the Far East.

The article then pointed out that the tense situation in the Far East is caused by the aggressive policy of the United States, which uses its armed forces to occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, territories that have belonged to China since ancient times, and attempts to expand its aggression to China's coastal islands.

The article said that the People's Republic of China, as an independent sovereign state, has the right to disallow any interference in its internal affairs, and has the right to retaliate against any attempt to invade its territory. People's China has the right and the strength to defend itself from aggressors. As can be seen from Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on September 6th, threats and blackmail cannot scare the Chinese people. The wave of millions of people rallies and demonstrations in this great country supporting Premier Zhou's statement clearly shows that the great Chinese people are ready to take up arms to defend their motherland's land, freedom, and socialist achievements.

The article pointed out that the Chinese government's willingness to resume talks with the United States to resolve the dispute between China and the United States in the Taiwan area is a new peace-loving measure that has been warmly welcomed by world opinion.

The article cited Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference to illustrate that the result of U.S. imperialism creating a tense situation is putting a noose around its own neck. The article then warned that the U.S. ruling clique should understand that the era in which they imposed their will on others by force or the threat of force is gone forever. World opinion and all peace-loving people will not allow arrogant aggressors and adventurers to act rashly, and resolutely demand that the United States immediately end its policies of provocation and blackmail.

"Izvestia" said in its editorial that the United States will never benefit from provocations. The American military demonstration obstructing the liberation of Taiwan and China's coastal islands cannot frighten the Chinese people.

"Red Star"’s editorial wrote that Soviet soldiers, like all the people, are vigilantly watching the events in the Far East. All members of the Soviet army must more resolutely improve their military skills and enhance the combat effectiveness and combat readiness of the troops and fleets. The Soviet people cannot ignore the expansion of provocations by aggressors in the Pacific Ocean, where the waves lap against our shores. The editorial said that the U.S. ruling group should recognize China's legitimate rights and interests, and completely end its policy of provocation and intimidation against the Chinese people. This is not only the demand of the Soviet people, but also the demand of the people of the powerful socialist camp and all progressive humanity.

"Soviet Navy News" said that Khrushchev's letter has received a wide response internationally. The Soviet armed forces stand on the post of defending the freedom and security of all ethnic groups, and their responsibilities are constantly increasing. Soviet soldiers are prepared to use all their strength to stop the instigators of war.

The "Soviet Air Force News" editorial said that Soviet soldiers, along with the entire people, warmly support and endorse the wise diplomatic policies of the Party and the government. China's security interests are inextricably linked to the Soviet Union's security interests. The Soviet people are prepared to help the Chinese people at any moment the aggressors oppose China.

People from all walks of life in the Soviet Union continue to express their enthusiasm and determination to support the Chinese people on various occasions. They warmly expressed that China is not alone, and China has many loyal friends. The Chinese and Soviet giants stand together and can tame war provocateurs.

### 中苏巨人能够制服战争狂人  苏联舆论拥护赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信

    中苏巨人能够制服战争狂人
    苏联舆论拥护赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信
    据新华社10日讯　苏联舆论热烈支持赫鲁晓夫在给艾森豪威尔的信中对美国侵略者所提出的严重警告。莫斯科各报今天都就这封信发表了再次警告美帝国主义的社论或编辑部文章。
    “真理报”和其他报纸反复引用了赫鲁晓夫的信中所谈的对中国的侵犯也就是对苏联的侵犯这句话。
    “真理报”编辑部以“收起挑衅和讹诈政策”为题发了一篇文章，严厉谴责美帝国主义对中国人民的挑衅行动。
    文章说，全世界对于美国在远东的新的挑衅活动感到非常愤慨。美国侵略者在集结了大量的海、空军作战部队以后，最近又在台湾南部组织美军和蒋介石部队的登陆演习。美国军舰不顾中华人民共和国政府的不止一次的严重警告，还不断地侵入中国的领海。文章在指出美国帝国主义这种狂妄的态度以后提出警告说，美国帝国主义者显然是忘记了他们是在同一个有能力给予毁灭性反击的大国打交道。
    文章接着说，伟大的中国是强大的，因为它有取之不尽用之不竭的人力和物力资源。此外，它还有随时都准备援助它的忠实的朋友。文章说，苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫给美国总统的信中就十分清楚地说明了这点。
    文章指出，赫鲁晓夫信中所表示的苏联政府的那种坚决而不含糊的态度并不是威胁，而是对那些有时由于疯狂的侵略意图而丧失现实感并从而造成危险局势的人的严重警告。因此，爱好和平的人们一致拥护这个警告，有远见的观察家还把苏联政府首脑的信看作是建立远东巩固的持久和平的计划。
    文章接着指出，远东的紧张局势是美国的侵略政策造成的，美国用它的武装力量侵占了自古以来就属于中国的领土——台湾和澎湖列岛，并且企图把自己的侵略扩大到中国的沿海岛屿。
    文章说，中华人民共和国作为一个独立的主权国家有权不允许别人对它的内政进行任何干涉，有权反击侵略它的领土的任何企图。人民中国有权也有力量保卫自己不受侵略者进犯。从中华人民共和国国务院周恩来总理9月6日的声明中可以看出：威胁讹诈是吓不倒中国人民的。在这个巨大的国家中所掀起的支持周总理声明的千百万人的集会和示威游行的浪潮明显地表明：伟大的中国人民准备拿起武器来保卫祖国的土地、自由和社会主义成果。
    文章指出，中国政府为了解决中美两国在台湾地区的争端表示愿意恢复同美国的会谈，这是新的爱好和平的措施，它得到世界舆论的热烈欢迎。
    文章引证了毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话，来说明美帝国主义制造紧张局势的结果是把绞索套在自己的脖子上。接着，文章提出警告说，美国统治集团应当懂得，他们用武力或武力威胁把自己的意志强加于别人的时代已经一去不复返了。世界舆论和一切爱好和平的人民不许狂妄的侵略者和冒险者轻举妄动，坚决要求美国立即结束挑衅和讹诈政策。
    “消息报”在社论中说：美国绝不会从挑衅中得到好处。美国阻挠解放台湾和中国沿海岛屿的军事示威吓不倒中国人民。
    “红星报”的社论写道，苏联军人和全体人民一样警惕地注视着远东的事件。苏军全体人员要更坚决地改进自己的军事技能，提高部队和舰队的战斗力和战斗准备。苏联人民不能对侵略者在海水拍击着我国海岸的太平洋上的扩大挑衅置之不理。社论说，美国统治集团应当承认中国的合法权利和利益，彻底结束对中国人民的挑衅和恫吓政策。这不仅是苏联人民的要求，也是强大的社会主义阵营各国人民和全体进步人类的要求。
    “苏联海军报”说，赫鲁晓夫的信在国际上得到了广泛的共鸣。苏联武装部队站在捍卫各族人民自由和安全的岗位上，他们的责任正在不断增长。苏联军人准备用一切力量来制止战争挑拨者。
    “苏联空军报”的社论说，苏联军人和全体人民一起热烈拥护和支持党和政府的英明外交政策。中国的安全利益是和苏联的安全利益不可分地联系在一起的。苏联人民准备在侵略者反对中国的任何时刻给中国人民以帮助。
    苏联各界人民继续在各种场合中表示支援中国人民的热情和决心。他们热烈表示，中国不是孤单的，中国有许多忠实朋友。中苏巨人站在一起，能够驯服战争挑拨者。
