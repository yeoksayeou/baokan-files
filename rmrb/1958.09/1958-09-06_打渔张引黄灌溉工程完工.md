Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 5th: The Dayuzhang Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project in Shandong Province has been completed by the end of August, three years and four months ahead of schedule.

The Dayuzhang Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project started in 1956. Encouraged by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the 221,700+ laborers and engineering technicians participating in the project broke with convention and adopted the method of simultaneous design, material preparation, and construction. They completed the entire project, originally scheduled for completion at the end of 1961, in just two years and four months.

The Dayuzhang Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project is part of the development and management of the Yellow River. The completion of this project, in addition to irrigating 5,120,000 mu of farmland in the Guangrao-Boxing plain of Shandong Province, completely freeing these areas from natural disasters such as drought, flood, barrenness, alkalinity, and sea tides, also solved the drinking water difficulties for 500,000 people and livestock in the irrigated area. 1,400,000 mu of saline-alkali wasteland near the Bohai Bay will also be transformed into fertile land after being flushed and desalinated.

　　打渔张引黄灌溉工程完工
    据新华社济南5日电　山东省境内的打渔张引黄灌溉工程已提前三年零四个月在8月底全部完工。
    打渔张引黄灌溉工程是在1956年开工的，参加这项工程建设的二十二万一千七百多个民工和工程技术人员在工农业生产大跃进形势的鼓舞下，打破常规，采取边设计，边备料，边施工的办法，在短短两年零四个月内，完成了预定在1961年年底竣工的全部工程。
    打渔张引黄灌溉工程是开发和治理黄河的一部分。这项工程的完工，除灌溉山东省广（饶）博（兴）平原的五百一十二万亩农田，使这些地方彻底摆脱旱、涝、荒、碱和海潮等自然灾害外，还解决了灌区五十万人民和牲畜的饮水困难。靠近渤海湾的一百四十万亩盐渍化荒地，经过冲洗排盐后，也将变为良田。
