Establishing Communes is an Inevitable Trend
Beijing
    This newspaper reports: In order to adapt to the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, the Shunyi District of Beijing, which originally had 19 townships and 414 agricultural cooperatives, merged all the agricultural cooperatives in July to establish eight large-scale people's communes, averaging 9,600 households per commune. The organizational structure has now been preliminarily established.
    By August 29, Fengtai District had built five people's communes: Shijingshan, Nanyuan Red Flag, Fengtai Shangyou, Lugouqiao Dongfanghong, and Changxindian. At present, the organizational structures of each commune have been preliminarily established, and they have begun to uniformly arrange wheat planting and plan for industrial and agricultural production in 1959.
    By August 30, the original 19 agricultural cooperatives in Haidian District had been merged to establish six people's communes: Si Ji Qing, Wanshoushan, Yuyuantan, Dongsheng, Haidian, and Qinghe.
　　Hebei
    This newspaper reports: Under the leadership of party organizations at all levels, the broad masses of farmers in the Shijiazhuang Special District of Hebei Province have launched a great upsurge in the movement to establish people's communes. By August 28, all 6,850 agricultural cooperatives in the district had been merged to form 141 people's communes. The establishment of people's communes has integrated workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers in the rural areas of the entire district, which will greatly promote the all-round leap forward in rural construction.
    By August 28, the Zhangjiakou Special District had established 109 people's communes. After the establishment of the people's communes, the masses were extremely enthusiastic, everyone was overjoyed, and everywhere was filled with joy. Zhang Fushan, a 70-year-old man from the Red Flag People's Commune in Huaian County, rarely went out in the past. This time, after hearing the news that the people's commune was established, he held a crutch in one hand and supported his little grandson with the other to participate in the celebration of the establishment of the commune.
    All 352 agricultural and fishing cooperatives in the suburbs of Tianjin have been merged to form 15 people's communes.
    The farmers and fishermen in the suburbs of Tianjin deeply feel that the organizational form of the original cooperatives can no longer meet the needs of the current great leap forward in production. The broad masses have long had the desire to establish large cooperatives. Especially after seeing Chairman Mao's praise of "People's communes are good," their enthusiasm was even higher, and they demanded the establishment of people's communes. The Red Flag and other fishing cooperatives in Tanggu District were brewing the establishment of a people's commune on the night of the 24th, and people went out to sea to fish, resolutely supporting the establishment of the commune with practical actions. The Shuguang Cooperative caught more than 10,000 kilograms of fish and shrimp in one night battle as a gift to the people's commune.
　　Heilongjiang
    This newspaper reports: Fifty-two people's communes have now been established in Heilongjiang Province. These people's communes are distributed in more than 40 counties (cities) across the province.
    The newly established people's communes immediately showed a new atmosphere. In order to welcome the establishment of the people's commune, the members of the Yonggui Agricultural Cooperative in Hulan County voluntarily extended their daily working hours by two to three hours, and within a few days they completed 85% of the entire fertilizer accumulation plan (only 45% was completed before the establishment of the people's commune).
　　Jilin
    This newspaper reports: So far, more than 40 people's communes have been established in more than 30 cities and counties including Changchun and Jilin in Jilin Province.
    At present, the cities and counties that have completed the pilot project of people's communes are summarizing and exchanging experiences. Places that have not conducted pilot projects are organizing forces to conduct pilot projects. Some counties have prepared to establish people's communes in batches and phases in a guided and planned manner after pilot projects.
　　Guangxi
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 1st: As of August 26, all 3,067 agricultural cooperatives in 16 counties of the Liuzhou Special District and Liuzhou City in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had been merged to form 256 people's communes, with an average of about 2,500 households per commune.
    The scale of this movement to establish people's communes and the enthusiasm of the masses are unprecedented. In recent days, more than 3 million people in the entire special district have been rejoicing, and the countryside is like a festival. The broad masses have expressed that they will welcome and celebrate the establishment of the people's commune with practical actions to improve production.
    In the process of establishing the people's commune, Laibin County carried out a blitz of accumulating 1.5 billion dan of fertilizer in three days, and completed the mid-tillage and topdressing of middle rice and sweet potato fields, and eliminated more than 35,000 mu of third-class seedlings.
Qinghai
    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 1st: As of August 30, the agricultural cooperatives in eleven counties and cities in the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province have all been transformed into people's communes in five counties and cities including Minhe, Ledu, Huangzhong, Huzhu, and Xining. A total of 61 people's communes have been established in these five counties and cities. The farmers who have joined the commune account for more than half of the total number of farmers in the province. Other agricultural cooperatives are also being transformed into communes.
    These newly established people's communes are generally one commune per township, with the integration of townships and communes. Some have combined several townships to establish people's communes with mountains and rivers and including the entire mountain and river, according to the needs of production development. As soon as these people's communes are established, they show greater advantages than agricultural cooperatives in terms of unified allocation of labor, expansion of reproduction, accelerating the realization of agricultural semi-mechanization, and running industries on a large scale.
　　Inner Mongolia
    This newspaper reports: All 392 agricultural cooperatives in Tongliao County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, were transformed into people's communes on August 27.
    Chairman Mao's instruction to establish people's communes inspired the people of all ethnic groups in Tongliao County. In recent days, about 150,000 applications and resolutions written by cadres of townships and cooperatives and farmers of all ethnic groups have flown to the Tongliao County Committee of the Communist Party of China like snowflakes. The county party committee cherishes the enthusiasm of the masses of all ethnic groups and quickly organized a propaganda team of 28,000 people to go deep into the townships and cooperatives to launch a vigorous propaganda campaign. Through methods such as large-scale airing of views, large-scale debates, and big-character posters, the masses realized the superiority of people's communes. After in-depth publicity and education work, the masses voluntarily established nine people's communes, and then, in a planned and step-by-step manner, transformed all the agricultural cooperatives in the county into people's communes.
    The completion of the people's communes has further inspired the enthusiasm of the masses of all ethnic groups. Each commune is determined to push the current production upsurge to a higher peak.
　　Gansu
    This newspaper reports: The 90 agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, have been merged to form 13 people's communes, with an average of more than 1,500 households per commune.
    The Gaolan Zhuangziping Agricultural Cooperative and the Guo Jiaping, Jian Gou, and Wenshan cooperatives were merged to form a people's commune. This commune is named "Gaolan Hero People's Commune."
    All members of the Jinyang Township in Wuwei County unanimously support the establishment of people's communes. On August 20, more than 6,000 people gathered to formally establish the Jinyang People's Commune, and on the spot, 1,327 big-character posters were issued, expressing their determination and congratulating the establishment of the people's commune.

　　建立公社是必然趋势
　　北京

    丰台区到8月29日，全区已经建成石景山、南苑红旗、丰台上游、芦沟桥东方红和长辛店等五个人民公社。目前，各社的组织机构已经初步建立，并且开始着手统一安排种麦和规划1959年工农业生产工作。
    到8月30日为止，海淀区原有的十九个农业社已经合并建立了四季青、万寿山、玉渊潭、东升、海淀、清河等六个人民公社。
　　河北
    本报讯　河北省石家庄专区广大农民群众，在各级党组织的领导下，已经掀起了一个伟大的建立人民公社运动的高潮。到8月28日，全区的六千八百五十个农业社，已经全部合并建成了一百四十一个人民公社。人民公社的建立，使全区农村中的工农商学兵结成了一体，必将大大促进农村建设的全面大跃进。
    张家口专区到8月28日，已经建成一百零九个人民公社。人民公社建起后，群众情绪万分高涨，人人欢天喜地，处处喜气洋洋。怀安县红旗人民公社七十高龄的张福山老人，过去很少出门，这次听说成立了人民公社，一手拄拐杖。一手扶着自己的小孙子，也参加了庆贺公社成立大会。
    天津市郊区三百五十二个农、渔业社全部合并建成十五个人民公社。
    天津郊区的农民和渔民，深深感到原来合作社的组织形式，已不能适应当前生产大跃进的需要。广大群众早就有办大社的要求，特别是见到毛主席赞扬“人民公社好”的消息后，情绪更加高涨，纷纷要求建立人民公社。塘沽区红旗等渔业社，24日夜晚正酝酿建立人民公社，人们就出海捕鱼，坚决用实际行动支持办公社。曙光社一个夜战就捕捞鱼虾一万多斤，作为向人民公社的献礼。
　　黑龙江
    本报讯　黑龙江省现在已有五十二个人民公社诞生。这批人民公社分布在全省四十多个县（市）。
    新建立起来的人民公社，马上就显出了新的气象。呼兰县原永贵农业社社员为了迎接人民公社的建立，自动把每天的劳动时间延长二至三小时，在几天之内就突击完成了整个积肥计划的85％（开始建立人民公社前只完成45％）。
　　吉林
    本报讯　吉林省到现在为止已有长春、吉林等三十多个市县，建成了四十多个人民公社。
    目前已经搞完人民公社试点的市县，正在总结交流经验，没有进行试点的地方，正在组织力量进行试点，有的县经过试点已准备有领导有步骤地分批分期建立人民公社。
　　广西
    据新华社南宁1日电到8月26日止，广西僮族自治区柳州专区十六个县和柳州市的三千零六十七个农业社已全部合并，建成二百五十六个人民公社，每个公社平均二千五百户左右。
    这次建立人民公社运动的规模之大，群众情绪之高涨，是空前的。近几天来，全专区三百多万人民欢欣鼓舞，农村中像过节日一样。广大群众都表示要以搞好生产的实际行动来迎接和庆祝人民公社的成立。
    来宾县在建立人民公社过程中，突击三天积肥十五亿担，并完成了中稻和红薯地中耕追肥工作，消灭三类禾苗三万五千多亩。青　海

    这些新建的人民公社一般都是乡社合一的一乡一社，有的根据生产发展的需要，联合了几个乡建立了有山有川、包括整个山川的人民公社。这些人民公社一办起来，不论在统一调配劳动力，扩大再生产，加速实现农业半机械化，以及大办工业等方面，都显示了比农业社更大的优越性。
　　内蒙古
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区通辽县三百九十二个农业社已在8月27日全部转为人民公社。

    人民公社的建成，更加鼓舞了各族群众的干劲，各个公社决心把当前生产高潮推向更高峰。
