The First Lesson of the New Semester
Nanjing Agricultural College Freshmen Go to the Fields for Production Labor Class

Xinhua News Agency report: More than 630 freshmen who were admitted to Nanjing Agricultural College this year, contrary to convention, did not first step into the classroom, but first went to the fields, together with all the teachers and older students, to take the first lesson of the new semester—the production labor class.

From this semester onwards, Nanjing Agricultural College, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, will, in addition to some teachers and students remaining at the school to manage the farms and factories they run themselves, send the rest to rural areas throughout the province for labor training, to learn and summarize farmers' production experience, and to establish their own agricultural science. The college leadership has decided to include production labor as a formal course. Students will study while farming, and teachers will teach while farming. At the same time, political classes will be strengthened. In the future, students who fail in production labor courses and political classes will have to repeat a year.

Each department has formulated new teaching syllabuses and teaching plans based on the principle of combining education with productive labor and the new situation in agricultural production since the Great Leap Forward. They have also implemented the spirit of continuous revolution, abolished courses that were divorced from reality, merged those that were repetitive, and connected those that were fragmented. For content that was not in the past curriculum but was necessary for production, they will write teaching materials while engaging in production labor and absorbing the practical experience created by the masses, incorporating the most advanced experience in agricultural production in our country into the teaching materials. The college has successively sent teachers and students to Macheng, Gucheng, and Xiaogan counties in Hubei Province, and Liyang, Zhenze, and Huaiyin in Jiangsu Province, where high-yield experiences were created, to learn and further their studies. They have also invited leading cadres and labor models from high-yield areas to the school to give lectures. After the start of the semester, teachers and students of the Department of Agricultural Economics went to rural areas throughout Jiangsu Province to study new teaching materials for the Department of Agricultural Economics in the process of jointly establishing people's communes with farmers.

This teaching innovation at Nanjing Agricultural College adopted the mass line of great debate, mobilizing teachers and students to participate in teaching reform together. Teachers and students worked together to compile teaching materials, using collective wisdom to improve the quality of teaching. Students learned while engaging in production, and teachers conducted on-site teaching, enabling students to acquire complete knowledge. Some of the scientific research projects originally planned by the college that were not sufficiently integrated with production practice or lagged behind reality have been abandoned. The newly proposed projects include the new main experiences created by farmers in the Great Leap Forward of production in various places, and the new issues that have emerged in current agricultural production. For example, deep plowing, close planting, fertilization, irrigation, mechanization, electrification, etc., have all been drawn up into specific research topics.

### 新学年的第一课  南京农学院新生走向田间上生产劳动课

    新学年的第一课
    南京农学院新生走向田间上生产劳动课
    据新华社讯　今年考入南京农学院的六百三十多名新生，一反常规，不是首先跨进教室，而是首先走向田间，同全院教师、老同学一起，上了新学年的第一课——生产劳动课。
    从本学期起，南京农学院遵照中央和江苏省委的指示，除一部分师生留在学校经营自己办的农场、工厂外，其余一律下放到省内各地农村进行劳动锻炼，学习和总结农民生产经验，建立自己的农业科学。学院领导上已经决定把生产劳动列入正式课程，学生边耕边读，教师边耕边教，同时加强政治课，今后凡生产劳动课和政治课不及格的学生都要留级。
    各系都根据教育和生产劳动相结合的方针和大跃进以来农业生产上出现的新情况，拟定了新的教学大纲和教学计划，并且贯彻了不断革命的精神，把脱离实际的课程取消，把重复的合并，把分割的贯穿起来，对过去课程中没有而又是生产所必需的内容，就一边生产劳动，一边吸取群众创造的实践经验编写教材，把我国农业生产最先进的经验编到教材里去。学院曾先后派出教师、学生到创造高产经验的湖北省麻城、谷城、孝感县和江苏省的溧阳、震泽、淮阴等地去学习和进修，聘请高产区的领导干部和劳动模范来校讲课。农业经济系的师生在开学后就分别到江苏省各地农村，在和农民共同建立人民公社的过程中研究农业经济系的新教材。
    南京农学院的这次教学革新，采取了群众路线的大争大辩的办法，发动师生共同参加教学改革，教师、学生一齐动手编教材，以集体智慧提高教学质量。学生边生产边学习，教师进行现场教学，使学生能获得完整的知识。学院原订的科学研究项目，有一些和生产实践结合不够或落后于实际的，都被放弃了。新提出的项目，包括了各地农民在生产大跃进中创造的新的主要经验，和当前农业生产上出现的新课题。例如深耕、密植、施肥、灌溉、机械化、电气化等等，都拟定了具体的研究课题。
