Xinhua News Agency, September 21st—Amidst the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the widespread popularization of culture, an unprecedented mass sports movement upsurge is taking shape in factories, villages, military units, and schools across the country. "Serve production, serve national defense," "Participate in ten minutes of exercise every day, work ten more years for socialism," "Exercise to build a healthy body and a long life" are the clear slogans in the great leap forward of mass sports movements. Currently, the number of people regularly participating in physical exercise nationwide has surged to over 110 million, more than nine times the total number regularly participating in physical exercise last year.

The characteristics of this year's mass sports movement are large scale, rapid action, diverse methods, and good results. The wave of the sports great leap forward has rapidly spread from cities to vast rural areas, eliminating many "dead corners." Underground workers, three-shift workers, farmers in mountainous areas, and even scientists, professors who have long resided in their studies, people over fifty years old, and housewives who rarely participated in sports activities in the past have also actively joined the ranks of physical exercise. More than thirty provinces, cities, and counties, including Beijing, Chongqing, Hunan, and Xining, have held mass sports leap forward months and activity weeks under the leadership of the Party committees to popularize sports activities through mass movements, creating a situation of everyone participating and blooming everywhere. Currently, more than 160 advanced counties, such as Gaotang, Beipiao, Huangyan, and Xiangtan, have basically popularized sports activities. This fact has powerfully shattered the conservative ideas that "rural areas have no conditions to engage in sports" and the erroneous views such as "engaging in sports will delay production." In Gaotang County, Shandong Province, sports and production have been "twisted into one rope." Currently, more than 80% of the people in this county participate in sports associations, nearly 60% of young people participate in labor-defense system exercises, and more than 10,000 people have reached the labor-defense system passing standards. This county mobilized the masses to establish 600 youth sports schools based on the principles of simplicity and local materials, and each township and commune built small sports fields and prepared simple sports equipment.

In urban factories, schools, and even streets, more and more people are participating in sports activities. Tianjin Wool Factory, under the conditions of poor equipment, little funding, and small space, fully mobilized the masses. One hundred percent of the employees do calisthenics and passed the first-level standard of the labor-defense system, thus increasing the labor attendance rate to 97.4%. Currently, there are more than 60 advanced factories, mines, enterprises, and units nationwide that have caught up with and approached the Tianjin Wool Factory. Many factories and mines that have always lagged behind in sports activities have also planted advanced red flags. Currently, five higher education institutions, including Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering, have won sports red flags among higher education institutions nationwide.

The popularization of mass sports movements has provided a solid foundation for improving my country's sports technical level. Currently, there are more than 380 sports masters and more than 270,000 graded athletes nationwide. Since the beginning of this year, a large number of new forces have emerged in track and field and ball games. Many young male and female athletes are bravely challenging national records and even world records. From the beginning of this year to date, my country's athletes have broken 85 national records more than 300 times. Athlete Liang Jianxun broke the national men's 100-meter record that was created before liberation and had been maintained for 25 years, thus completely updating the "highest record" of the old China before liberation. This year, my country's athletes also created a world record in the clean and jerk of lightweight weightlifting. My country's weightlifting, table tennis, basketball, volleyball, gymnastics, aviation modeling, multi-nautical events, radio, shooting, gliding, parachuting, and other sports projects, as well as individual track and field and swimming projects, have reached or caught up with international standards. From January to August this year, my country's athletes won 144 games, tied 15 games, and won seven championships in 245 international competitions. Tens of thousands of excellent athletes are currently responding to the call of the State Sports Commission, studying and training hard, and striving to rapidly improve sports technology and release more, bigger, and higher sports "satellites."

    影群众性体育高潮在全国形成
    一亿一千多万人经常参加体育锻炼
    据新华社21日讯　在工农业生产大跃进和文化大普及声中，一个史无前例的群众性体育运动高潮正在全国的工厂、农村、部队、学校中形成。“为生产、为国防服务”、“每人每天参加十分钟锻炼，为社会主义多工作十年”、“锻炼身体，人寿年丰”是群众性体育运动大跃进中的鲜明口号，目前全国经常参加体育锻炼的已经激增到一亿一千多万人，为去年经常参加体育锻炼的总数的九倍多。
    今年以来的群众性体育运动的特点是声势大、动作快、办法多、收效好。体育大跃进的波澜迅速从城市扩及到广大农村，许多“死角”被消灭，过去很少参加体育活动的井下工人、三班制工人、山区农民，以至久居书斋的科学家、教授、年过半百的老人和家庭妇女等，也都积极投入了体育锻炼的行列。北京、重庆、湖南、西宁等三十多个省、市、县在党委领导下举办了全民性的体育跃进月、活动周等，以群众运动的方式普及体育活动，形成大家动手，遍地开花的局面。目前全国出现了高唐、北票、黄岩、湘潭等一百六十多个基本上普及体育活动的先进县，这个事实有力地粉碎了“农村没条件搞体育”的保守思想和“搞体育就要耽误生产”等错误观点。在山东省的高唐县，体育同生产已经“拧成一股绳”，目前这个县80％以上的人参加了体育协会，近60％的青年人参加了劳卫制锻炼，达到劳卫制及格标准的已经有一万多人。这个县发动群众本着因陋就简、就地取材的原则建立了六百所青少年体育学校，每个乡每个社都修建了小型运动场，制备了简易体育器材。
    在城市的工厂和学校以至街道，参加体育运动的人越来越多。天津市绒毛厂在设备差、经费少、场地小的条件下，充分发动群众，百分之百的职工做广播操，并通过了劳卫制一级标准，因此使劳动出勤率提高到97.4％。目前全国已经赶上和接近天津绒毛厂的先进厂矿企业、单位已有六十多个。许多体育活动一向落后的厂矿也插上了先进红旗。目前全国高等学校中已经有西安建筑工程学院等五所高等院校夺得了体育红旗。
    群众性体育运动的普及，为我国体育技术水平的提高提供了坚实的基础。目前全国已经有运动健将三百八十多人，等级运动员二十七万多人。今年以来在田径运动和球类等项比赛中新生力量大批地涌现出来，许多青年男女运动员正在勇敢地向国家纪录以至世界纪录冲击。从今年年初到目前为止，我国运动员先后打破了八十五项三百多次全国纪录，运动员梁建勋刷新了解放以前创造的、保持了二十五年之久的男子百公尺全国纪录，从而把解放以前的旧中国的“最高纪录”全部更新了。今年，我国运动员还创造了轻量级举重挺举世界纪录。我国的举重、乒乓球、篮球、排球、体操、航空模型、航海多项、无线电、射击、滑翔、跳伞等体育项目和田径、游泳的个别项目已经达到或赶上了国际水平。我国运动员从今年1月到8月在二百四十五次国际比赛中，胜了一百四十四场，平了十五场，并夺得了七项冠军。成千上万的优秀运动员们目前正响应国家体委的号召，苦学苦练，为迅速提高运动技术水平，放出更多、更大、更高的体育“卫星”而斗争。
