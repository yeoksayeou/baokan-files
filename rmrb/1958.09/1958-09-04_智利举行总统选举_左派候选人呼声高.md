　　Chile Holds Presidential Election
　　Left-Wing Candidate Has High Popular Support
    This newspaper provides comprehensive coverage: The Chilean presidential election, held every six years, took place on September 4th.

    In this presidential election, all parties and political forces in Chile nominated a total of four presidential candidates. The left-wing forces, led by the Popular Action Front of Chile, nominated Salvador Allende, the chairman of the Popular Action Front and leader of the Socialist Party, as their candidate. The Radical Party nominated Bossay as their candidate. The Christian Democratic Party nominated Frei as their candidate. Another candidate was Alessandri, who used "independence" as a smokescreen, but in reality, he had close ties with the most reactionary Conservative and Liberal parties in Chile. Behind him were the support of Chilean big capitalists, large landowners, and American imperialism. Because the middle class, which the Radical Party and Christian Democratic Party candidates hoped to gain support from, was splitting up during the election campaign, and their mass base was becoming increasingly narrow, the election campaign was mainly centered around Allende and Alessandri.

    The current situation in Latin America and Chile is favorable to Allende's campaign, who is supported by the patriotic and democratic forces of Chile. The movement of Latin American peoples for national independence, democracy, and peace is rising; Chile is facing serious economic difficulties due to the current president's policy of succumbing to American monopoly capital and American plunder of Chile. All of this has aroused the anti-American sentiment of the Chilean people and an urgent demand for the establishment of an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal government that implements an independent policy.

    The patriotic program proposed by Allende, which includes implementing democratic policies domestically and striving for national independence externally, is in line with the wishes of the Chilean people. At the same time, the democratic forces united in the Popular Action Front are growing stronger, the reactionary "Law for the Defense of Democracy" has been abolished, and the Communist Party has regained its legal status, all of which have created favorable conditions for Allende to win. In the course of the election campaign, the Communist Party of Chile has repeatedly called on all democratic forces to unite around Allende and his program, strive to defeat Alessandri, and ensure Allende's election.

    On the other hand, Alessandri and his supporters are intimidating and bribing voters, and even using methods such as distributing milk, sugar, and other foods in cities to canvass votes; in rural areas, large landowners are intimidating and deceiving farmers, and are prepared to force farmers to vote for Alessandri during the election.

### 智利举行总统选举  左派候选人呼声高

    智利举行总统选举
　　左派候选人呼声高
    本报综合报道　六年一度的智利总统选举，于9月4日举行。
    在这次总统选举中，智利各党派和政治力量一共提出了四个总统候选人，以智利人民行动阵线为主的左派力量提出人民行动阵线主席、社会党领袖阿伦德为候选人；激进党提出波萨伊为候选人；基督教民主党提出弗莱伊为候选人；另一个候选人是亚历山德里，他打着“独立”的幌子，实际上同智利最反动的保守党和自由党有密切联系，在他的背后有智利大资本家、大地主和美帝国主义的支持。由于激进党和基督教民主党候选人指望得到支持的中间阶层在竞选运动中正在分化，他们的群众基础越来越狭窄，因此，竞选运动主要是环绕着阿伦德和亚历山德里在进行。
    目前拉丁美洲和智利的局势，有利于受到智利爱国民主力量支持的阿伦德的竞选。拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族独立、争取民主和和平的运动日益高涨；智利由于现任总统执行屈从于美国垄断资本的政策以及美国对智利的掠夺，使得智利陷于严重的经济困难中，这一切都引起智利人民反美情绪的高涨并迫切要求成立一个执行独立政策的反帝反封建政府。
    阿伦德提出的对内进行民主政策和对外争取民族独立的爱国主义纲领，符合于智利人民的愿望。同时由于团结在人民行动阵线中的民主力量日益壮大，反动的“保卫民主法”已被废除，共产党恢复了合法地位，这都为阿伦德获得胜利创造了有利条件。在竞选进程中，智利共产党不止一次地号召一切民主力量团结在阿伦德及其纲领的周围，争取击败亚历山德里，使阿伦德当选。
    另一方面，亚历山德里及其支持者正在对选民进行威迫利诱，甚至采取在城市以送牛奶、糖等食品的方式拉票；在乡村，大地主对农民进行恐吓欺骗，并准备在选举时强迫农民投亚历山德里的票。
