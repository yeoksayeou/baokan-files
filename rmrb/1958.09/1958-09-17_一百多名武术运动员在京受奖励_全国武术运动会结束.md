Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The 1958 National Wushu Games held in Beijing have concluded. One hundred and thirty-two outstanding male and female athletes received awards from the organizing committee.

Thirty athletes won first-class awards, including Cai Hongxiang from Shanghai, who is skilled in the Twelve Roads Huaquan and Zi Wu Jian; Cheng Chuanrui from Beijing, a master of Changquan; Pan Shuyi, a female athlete from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region who practices Taijiquan; and Xiao Yingpeng, a well-known Houquan (Monkey Fist) master from Sichuan Province. Gao Zhengyi, a Chaquan master from Jilin Province, and forty-two others won second-class awards. Zhao Jiao from Guangdong Province and sixty others won third-class awards.

Some referees also participated in double sparring, weapons, and boxing performances, and twenty-four of them won awards.

In the comprehensive boxing competition, many of the award-winning athletes had the characteristics of being physically strong, agile, and technically proficient. The techniques of the more than fifty young athletes who participated in this competition were also relatively skilled, and three of them won first-class awards. Another feature of this conference was that some athletes broke with superstition, absorbed the traditional techniques of Wushu, and created some new "routines" (techniques), which have developed our country's Wushu techniques. The boxing techniques performed by Sun Shiyin and others from Tianjin all have a brave and vigorous style, reflecting the vigorous spirit of the youth of socialist New China.

    一百多名武术运动员在京受奖励
    全国武术运动会结束
    新华社16日讯　在北京举行的1958年全国武术运动会已经结束。一百三十二名优秀男女运动员得到了大会的奖励。
    获得一等奖的有三十人，其中有擅长十二路华拳和子午剑的上海运动员蔡鸿祥；北京市的长拳能手成传锐；广西僮族自治区的太极拳女运动员潘淑仪；四川省著名猴拳能手萧应鹏等。吉林省的查拳能手高正谊等四十二人获得二等奖。广东省的赵教等六十人获得三等奖。
    部分裁判还参加了双人对打、器械、拳术表演，有二十四人获奖。
    在综合拳术比赛中，许多获奖运动员都具有体质健壮、动作敏捷、技术纯熟的特点。参加这次比赛的五十多名少年运动员的技术也都比较熟练，并有三名获得了一等奖。这次大会的另一个特点，是有些运动员打破迷信，吸收武术运动的传统技巧，创造了一些新的“套路”（技法），使我国武术运动技术有了发展。天津市运动员孙世寅等表演的拳术，就都具有勇猛、健美的作风，体现出社会主义新中国青年的蓬勃朝气。
