According to the Xinhua Daily, in order to universally implement deep plowing measures for all autumn-sown crops throughout the county, the Taixing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province recently launched an agricultural tool reform movement focused on deep plowing throughout the county. Huang Sanlin, a worker at the Shanhu Township Agricultural Tool Repair Factory and a former boatman, was inspired by the windlass used to raise anchors on boats and thought of using a windlass for deep plowing. He was also indirectly inspired by Li Zhaosen's creation of the lead wire traction principle in Gaoyou County. He then worked with local farmers to conduct experiments on using a windlass for deep plowing. The Taixing County Committee attached great importance to this experiment, holding seven special meetings in succession and making more than a dozen improvements to the windlass. The county recently used a windlass with rope traction for deep plowing in carrot fields. Three or four people operating one windlass can plow three to four mu per day, averaging one mu per person, which is more than ten times more efficient than pulling a plow by manpower. The depth of deep plowing exceeds two to three times that of human and animal-drawn plows. According to the experiment, the pulling force of the windlass rope traction is equivalent to 2,000 to 2,200 jin, which is comparable to the strength of five strong oxen, and even exceeds tractors in depth when plowing simultaneously with tractors.

*Fengxian Daily* This newspaper from Fengxian reports: Our reporter, Gu Ping, reports that rope-traction deep plowing tools, powered by motorized and human/animal power, have been successfully tested in Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province. The entire county will universally adopt these tools starting in September to deep plow more than 400,000 mu of autumn fields to a depth of 1.5 to 2 chi.

The successful experimentation of rope-traction deep plowing tools not only solves the contradiction between the current demands for deep plowing and the shortage of labor, but more importantly, it prepares the way for the mechanization and electrification of agricultural farming tools. When industrial production can provide enough diesel engines or generators, rope-traction tools can all be powered by machines and electricity. Because this type of rope-traction tool can plow fields, it is also possible to use it for various field operations such as harvesting, weeding, and transplanting rice seedlings. Once these problems are solved, agricultural electrification can be widely applied.

The Fengxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has convened a special bureau meeting to deploy the comprehensive promotion of rope-traction deep plowing tools. Currently, the county's iron and wood industry workers are concentrating their main efforts on rushing to produce this new tool. The county will make a concentrated effort to manufacture more than 2,200 sets of motorized and manual winch-powered tools in a short period of time, and rush to produce more than 1,000 large-sized deep plows. In addition to the existing 1,000+ double-wheeled, double-furrow plows, each of the county's 2,000+ production brigades will have a rope-traction deep plowing tool to invest in the deep plowing of land movement. To guarantee 70% of farmland will adopt rope-traction plows for deep plowing. Coupled with oxen plowing and human hoeing, the average daily deep plowing rate is 10,000 to 15,000 mu, to timely complete the county's 400,000 mu deep plowing plan.

The manual or animal-powered rope traction deep plowing type is powered by six or four people (or livestock) pushing a winch (placed on the headland). The rope on the winch pulls the plow back and forth through a reversing pulley to plow the land. The rope traction device can not only drive a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow, but also a specially-made large-sized deep plow. Using a large-sized deep plow, an average of six people can plow three mu per day, which is about ten times faster than plowing by manpower. When using this machine for plowing with a motorized rope traction deep plow, once the machine is started, the belt pulley and large and small gears drive the two winch drums to rotate quickly. The steel cable on the winch drum drags the plow to plow the land through several reversing pulleys. It can plow 50 meters per minute. After one row is plowed, move the reversing pulley on the transfer rod at both ends of the plowed land and turn the plow over to start plowing the second row. If it is necessary to stop or change direction and position in the middle, simply move the clutch on the traction part to stop the winch drum from moving. This machine can deeply plow 1.5 to 2 chi with a large-sized deep plow, and 8 to 9 cun with a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow (this is the maximum deep plowing limit of a double-furrow plow), and can plow 1.5 to 2 mu per hour.

　　深耕工具百花开
    据新华日报消息  中共江苏泰兴县委为了使全县所有秋播作物普遍贯彻深耕的措施，不久以前在全县范围内开展了以深耕为主的农具改革运动。珊瑚乡农具修配厂工人、船工出身的黄三林从船上绞锚的绞关联想到使用绞关深耕，后来又间接受到李兆森在高邮县创造铅丝牵引原理的启发，就和当地农民一起进行了使用绞关深耕的试验。泰兴县委对这个试验很重视，连续举行了七次专题会议，对绞关作了十几次改进。该县最近在胡萝卜田内使用绞关绳索牵引深耕，三、四个人操作一部绞关，一天可耕三亩至四亩，平均一人耕一亩，比用人力拉犁，工效提高十倍以上，深耕的深度超过人、畜拉犁二倍至三倍。根据试验，绞关绳索牵引的拉劲相等于二千市斤至二千二百市斤，可抵得上五头壮牛的力气，与拖拉机同时耕作，在深度上也超过拖拉机。本报奉贤电　记者古平报道：机动和人畜力推动的绳索牵引深耕工具在江苏省奉贤县试验成功。从9月开始全县普遍采用这种工具，要把四十多万亩秋田深翻一尺五到二尺。
    绳索牵引深耕工具的试验成功，不但解决了当前深耕要求和劳力不足之间的矛盾，更重要的意义还在于为农业耕作工具的机械化和电气化作好了准备。当工业生产能够提供足够的柴油机或发电机时，绳索牵引工具就可以全部用机器和电力作动力了。因为，这种绳索牵引工具既能耕田，就有可能担任收割、锄草、插秧等等各种田间耕作，一旦这些问题解决了，农业电气化就有可能广泛运用。
    中共奉贤县委已召开专局会议，布置绳索牵引深耕工具的全面推广工作。目前，全县铁、木业工人正集中主要力量赶制这种新工具。全县要在短期内突击制造机动的和人力绞盘牵引的工具二千二百多套，并赶制出一千多部大号深耕犁。加上原有的一千多部双轮双铧犁，全县二千多个生产大队将队队有一部绳索牵引深耕工具投入深翻土地的运动，保证70％的农田采用绳索牵引犁进行深耕。再加上牛耕和人坌，每天平均以深翻一万亩到一万五千亩的速度，及时完成全县四十万亩的深翻计划。人力或畜力绳索牵引深耕型由六人或四人（或用牲畜）推动绞盘（放在田头上），绞盘上的绳索通过转向滑轮牵着耕犁来回耕地。绳索牵引器不但能带动双轮双铧犁，还能带动特制的大号深耕犁。用大号深耕犁平均六人一天可耕三亩，比用人力翻地约快十倍。机动绳索牵引深耕犁用这种机具耕地时，机器一开动，皮带盘和大小齿轮就带动两个绞绳盘很快地转动起来。绞绳盘上的钢索通过几个转向滑轮拖着耕犁耕地，每分钟可耕五十公尺，一行耕过之后，移动一下耕地两端移行杆上的转向滑轮，把犁掉过头，就开始耕第二行。如在中途需要停下来或变换方向和位置，只要搬动一下牵引部分上的离合器，绞绳盘即可停止活动。这种机具拖大号深耕犁可深耕一尺五到二尺，拖双轮双铧犁可深耕八、九寸（这是双铧犁最大的深耕限度），每小时可耕一亩半到二亩。
