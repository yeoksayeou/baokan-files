Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, September 4th. The Albanian Ministry of National Defense newspaper "Warrior" published a commentary on September 4th entitled "Imperialist Provocations are Doomed to Fail," severely condemning the US imperialists for occupying Taiwan and launching provocations against the People's China.

The commentary said: The Albanian people and the public of all countries are sternly condemning the US imperialists' conspiracy in the Far East and fully supporting the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and other islands. To touch China is to touch all socialist countries. They will receive the answer they deserve and suffer a shameful defeat.

The commentary added that the United States has no reason to occupy and attempt to occupy Chinese islands for a long time. The Chinese people will give it the answer it deserves. The People's China's army is vigilantly defending the victories of the Chinese people and is prepared to give a devastating blow to every rash move by US imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague. The Czechoslovak newspaper "People's Front" strongly condemned the United States' war provocations against China in a commentary yesterday. The newspaper said that the recent intensified acts of aggression were carefully prepared and well-timed.

"People's Front" emphasized that as for how long Quemoy, Matsu, the Pescadores Islands and Taiwan will serve the war provocateurs, this question can no longer be solved by Dulles' diplomacy and the Seventh Fleet. This will be decided by the great Chinese people and its legitimate government, and this decision will be supported by the full moral and material strength of peace-loving countries.

    新华社地拉那4日电　阿尔巴尼亚国防部机关报“战士报”4日发表了以“帝国主义的挑衅定将失败”为题的一篇评论，严厉斥责美帝国主义者侵占台湾和向人民中国发动挑衅。
    评论说：阿尔巴尼亚人民和世界各国的公众都在严正地谴责美帝国主义在远东的阴谋，并且全力支持中国人民为解放台湾和其他岛屿的斗争。谁要触动中国就是触动所有的社会主义国家。他将得到应有的回答和遭到可耻的失败。
    评论又说，美国没有任何的理由来占领和企图长期占领中国的岛屿。中国人民将给它以应有的回答。人民中国的军队正在警惕地保卫中国人民的胜利，并且准备给予美帝国主义的每一个轻举妄动以毁灭性的打击。
    据新华社布拉格电　捷克斯洛伐克“人民防线报”昨天在一篇评论中强烈谴责美国对中国的战争挑衅行动。这家报纸说，最近加紧进行的侵略行动是经过仔细准备和选好时机的。
    “人民防线报”强调指出，至于金门、马祖、澎湖列岛和台湾将为战争挑衅者服务多久这一问题，已经不是杜勒斯的外交和第七舰队所能解决。这将由伟大的中国人民和它的合法政府来决定，这种决定将受到爱好和平的国家的全部道义力量和物质力量的支持。
