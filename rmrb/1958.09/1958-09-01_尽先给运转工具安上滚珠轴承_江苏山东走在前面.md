　　Give Priority to Installing Ball Bearings on Operating Tools
　　Jiangsu and Shandong Take the Lead
　　This newspaper reports: After more than twenty days of hard work, Jiangsu Province has basically achieved the ball bearingization of its transportation, irrigation and drainage, and threshing tools. As of the 23rd, 62 of the 77 counties and cities in Jiangsu Province had basically achieved the ball bearingization of transportation, irrigation and drainage, and threshing tools, and 6 counties had basically achieved the ball bearingization of irrigation and drainage tools. The total number of complete sets of bearings has reached more than 5,634,000 sets. 86% of the province's 2,759,000 old-style transportation, irrigation and drainage, and threshing tools have been fitted with ball bearings. In addition, more than 430,000 double-shared plows, stone mills, stone rollers and other deep plowing and operating tools have been fitted with ball bearings.
　　In July, only Suqian County in Jiangsu Province achieved bearingization, and there were only 55 units producing ball bearings in the province. Since the telephone conference of the prefectural and municipal party committee secretaries convened by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee at the end of July, a mass movement involving the whole party and all the people to engage in bearingization has been rapidly launched throughout the province. Ball bearings are being made day and night everywhere in cities and villages, while manufacturing, installation, and production are being carried out simultaneously. Binhai County put forward the fighting slogan of "Mobilizing the eight craftsmen (iron, silver, copper, tin, white iron, pot repair, clock and watch, bicycle repair), breaking through three barriers (materials, technology, equipment), going all out, aiming high, and working hard for three days and nights to achieve bearingization." From August 1st to 23rd, the number of units producing ball bearings increased sharply to more than 65,000, more than 1,180 times higher than at the end of July. From the daily average speed, the initial increase was more than 1,000 production units per day, and from the 14th, it jumped sharply to more than 2,000 per day. The efficiency of old-fashioned farm tools fitted with ball bearings is generally increased by more than one and a half times. According to the calculation of the office of the Farm Tool Reform Committee of Jiangsu Province, the efficiency of the tools that have been fitted with ball bearings in the province is equivalent to an increase of more than 2.5 million laborers. Farmers call the windmills fitted with ball bearings "flying cars" and the small earth carts fitted with ball bearings "wind fire wheels."
　　In this movement, the broad masses of handicraftsmen and peasants have greatly promoted the communist style of daring to think and act, and inventions and creations have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Various bearings such as "firecracker pellets," "ceramic bearings," "bamboo bearings," "wooden bearings," and "glass bearings" have been created in various places. Some of these ball bearings are being tried out, and some are installed on irrigation and drainage, transportation and other tools for use, and the effect is good.
　　Now, the people of Jiangsu Province are concentrating their efforts to further realize the bearingization of deep plowing tools and water conservancy tools, and to win another more beautiful victory.　　(Yan Songming)
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 31st: After twenty days of mass mobilization and continuous hard work, 113 counties and cities in rural Shandong have basically achieved ball bearingization of major operating tools. According to statistics on August 30, more than 61,370 ball bearing factories have been built in the province, producing more than 8,097,000 sets of ball bearings, and more than 3,260,000 pieces of farm tools, water lifting tools, and operating tools have been installed with ball bearings. Among them, more than 80% of the province's major operating tools have been fitted with ball bearings.
　　The installation of ball bearings on operating tools has greatly improved production efficiency. According to the understanding of Gaotang, Jinan, Laixi and other counties and cities, the efficiency of various operating tools after installing ball bearings has increased by one to three times compared with the original. The carrying capacity of the four-wheeled carts in these areas has increased by more than three times, and the efficiency of wheelbarrows has also increased by 1.5 times. In the past, a cow could only pull one stone roller for threshing (grain threshing), but after installing ball bearings, it can pull two to three. Many commune members said, "In the past, plowing the land exhausted the cattle, but with bearings, the cattle don't worry."
　　The most important reason for Shandong Province's rapid realization of ball bearingization of operating tools is not relying on factories or foreign methods, but relying on leaders personally taking charge, the whole party and all the people taking action, and relying on indigenous methods to manufacture. Since the Shandong Provincial Party Committee put forward the call to basically realize ball bearingization throughout the province in August, party organizations at all levels have personally taken action, organized the masses to carry out great airing of views, great debates, and criticism of conservative thinking, so that a high tide of manufacturing ball bearings has quickly formed throughout the province. For example, in Ju County, more than 50,000 people participated in making ball bearings, and the county showed the scene of "factories everywhere, everyone is a craftsman, everyone is smashing ball bearings, and every household is hammering." The county used only twenty days to install ball bearings on all 41,000 major operating tools in the county.
　　Now, the broad masses of people in Shandong are advancing victoriously at a rate of one million sets of ball bearings per day, and are further developing tool reform on the basis of ball bearingization.

### 尽先给运转工具安上滚珠轴承  江苏山东走在前面

    尽先给运转工具安上滚珠轴承
　　江苏山东走在前面
    本报讯　经过二十多天的奋力苦战，江苏省的运输、排灌和脱粒工具已基本实现了滚珠轴承化。到23日止，江苏省七十七个县市中有六十二个县市的运输、排灌、脱粒工具基本实现了滚珠轴承化，有六个县的排灌工具基本实现了滚珠轴承化，成套轴承的总数已达五百六十三万四千余套。全省二百七十五万九千多件旧式的运输、排灌和脱粒工具已经有86％装上滚珠轴承。此外，还有四十三万多件双铧犁、石磨、石滚等深耕和运转工具装上了滚珠轴承。
    7月份江苏省只有一个宿迁县实现了轴承化，全省生产滚珠轴承的单位只有五十五个。自中共江苏省委7月底召开的地、市委书记参加的农具改革电话会议以后，全省范围以内，迅速展开了一个全党全民动手大搞轴承化的群众运动，整个城镇和农村到处日日夜夜大搞滚珠轴承，边制造、边安装、边投入生产。滨海县提出“动八匠（铁、银、铜、锡、白铁、补锅、钟表、自行车修理），破三关（材料、技术、设备），鼓足干劲力争上游，苦战三昼夜实现轴承化”的奋战口号。从8月1日到23日生产滚珠轴承的单位猛增到六万五千多个，比7月底增加了一千一百八十多倍。从每日平均速度来看，最初是每日增加生产单位一千多个，14日起每日猛跃到两千多个。旧式的农具装上了滚珠轴承，功效一般提高一倍半以上。据江苏省委农具改革委员会办公室计算：全省已装上滚珠轴承的工具所发挥的效率等于增加了二百五十多万劳动力。农民们将装上滚珠轴承的风车叫“飞车”，将装上滚珠轴承的小土车叫“风火轮”。
    在这次运动中，广大手工业工人和农民大大发扬了敢想敢作的共产主义风格，发明创造像雨后春笋。各地创制的有“爆仗弹子”“陶制轴承”“竹制轴承”“木制轴承”“玻璃轴承”等多种轴承，这些滚珠轴承有的正在试用，有的安装在排灌、运输等工具上使用，效果均良好。
    现在江苏全省人民正集中精力进一步实现深耕深翻工具、水利工具的轴承化，再打一个更漂亮的胜利仗。　　（严松明）
    新华社济南31日电　经过二十天的全民动手，连续奋战，山东农村一百一十三个县、市基本上实现了主要运转工具滚珠轴承化。据8月30日的统计，全省共建成六万一千三百七十多个滚珠轴承厂，生产滚珠轴承八百零九十七万多套，已经有三百二十六万多件农具、提水工具和运转工具安装了滚珠轴承。其中占全省80％以上的主要运转工具，都安装了滚珠轴承。
    运转工具安上滚珠轴承，大大提高了生产效率。据高唐、济南、莱西等县市的了解，各种运转工具安装滚珠轴承后，效率都比原来提高一倍至三倍。这些地区的四轮大车，载重量提高三倍以上，独轮小车也提高效率一点五倍，过去打场（谷物脱粒）用的石磙，一个牛只能拉一个，安装滚珠轴承后可以拉两个到三个。许多社员说：“过去耕地累死牛，换上轴承牛不愁”。
    山东省迅速实现运转工具滚珠轴承化，最主要的不是靠工厂，靠洋办法，而是靠领导亲自挂帅，全党全民动手，靠土法制造。自中共山东省委提出8月份全省基本实现滚珠轴承化的号召后，各级党组织亲自动手，组织群众大鸣大放大辩论，批判保守思想，因而很快在全省范围内形成了制造滚珠轴承的高潮。例如莒县，参加造滚珠轴承的有五万多人，全县出现“到处是工厂，人人是工匠，人人砸滚珠，家家铁锤响”的景象，这个县仅用二十天的时间，就将全县四万一千多件主要运转工具全部安装上了滚珠轴承。
    现在，山东广大人民正以日产滚珠轴承百万套的速度乘胜前进，在滚珠轴承化的基础上，进一步大搞工具改革。
