Xinhua News Agency, September 4th dispatch: Washington—While the US air and naval forces are stepping up their concentration in the Taiwan area, US government leaders are holding frequent meetings to discuss how to further escalate tensions in the Far East and launch new provocations against People's China.
　　US President Eisenhower, who is vacationing in Newport, has decided to summon Secretary of State Dulles, who is in Washington, to Newport to discuss the so-called "serious situation" in the Taiwan area, that is, to discuss ways for the United States to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. Eisenhower also spoke with Dulles three times by telephone on the 1st and 2nd regarding this issue. It is said that Eisenhower is now considering issuing a "tough statement" to launch new intimidation against the Chinese people.
　　Dulles also held talks on the 3rd with Defense Secretary McElroy, Undersecretary of Defense Quarles, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining. According to McElroy, they considered various possibilities for the United States to "take action in the Far East."
　　Prior to this, McElroy blatantly provoked the Chinese people who are determined to liberate Taiwan. After attending the American Legion convention in Chicago, he told reporters upon returning to Washington that the US aim is to mobilize forces in the Western Pacific to "contain" China, that the Seventh Fleet is being strengthened, and that some units of the Tactical Air Command have been transferred to the Far East, "If the Chinese are smart, they will stop."
　　On September 2nd, Dulles also held a meeting with members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The State Department later issued a statement on the meeting, saying that the United States considers the "situation serious" in the Taiwan area. The statement attempted to attribute the cause of the tension in the Taiwan area to the Chinese people's "continued use of force in the general area of the Taiwan Strait in pursuit of their territorial goals."
　　On the 3rd, Dulles also summoned the diplomatic envoys of the seven countries participating in the US-fabricated "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization"—Britain, France, New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan—regarding the situation in the Taiwan area, to seek support from these vassal states for US military adventures in the Far East. Dulles also attempted to drag these countries into the water. State Department Press Officer Lipp emphasized that Dulles believes the Taiwan area situation is "relevant to the neighboring countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."
　　According to the US Air Force Department, Air Force Vice Chief of Staff and former Strategic Air Command Commander LeMay will go to Taiwan on the morning of the 4th to carry out provocative activities against China.
　　Xinhua News Agency, September 4th dispatch: News from various places in the Far East shows that in order to step up the creation of tension in the Far East and expand provocative activities in the Taiwan Strait, the United States continues to mass its military forces in Taiwan, the Philippines, Okinawa, and other places.
　　According to a report by an Associated Press reporter from Clark Air Base in the Philippines, the US Air Force "is quietly concentrating in the Western Pacific," "This is probably the largest concentration of US Air Force power since the Korean War." A US Air Force spokesman said, "Air Force strength in the Far East is being strengthened by fighter planes and transport planes"; the US Thirteenth Air Force, centered at Clark Air Base, "is already in a state of combat readiness."
　　The report quoted informed sources at Clark Air Base and diplomatic sources in Manila as saying that the US Air Force is carrying out a series of transfers, "and has strengthened or will soon strengthen Air Force combat units at Clark Air Base, Taiwan, and Okinawa."
　　According to a Taipei dispatch: Commander Smoot of the "US Taiwan Defense Command" said at a press conference on the 3rd that US military "aid to the Chiang Kai-shek group is arriving."
　　On the same day, Liu Tsai-heung, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Syngman Rhee group, who left Taipei for Seoul after engaging in conspiracy activities in Taiwan, said that he and Chiang Kai-shek had "discussed many plans." In order to cooperate with the US-Chiang group's expansion of provocative activities in the Taiwan Strait, he also blatantly clamored that the Syngman Rhee group "may" attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At the same time, Syngman Rhee's Air Force Minister Chang De-chang also declared in Seoul that Syngman Rhee's Air Force is in a so-called "constant state of alert."

　　策划对我国进行新挑衅
　　华盛顿头子会商频繁
　　美国继续在太平洋集结军事力量
    据新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国海空军加紧在台湾地区集结的时候，美国政府领导人频繁地举行会议，商讨怎样进一步加剧远东紧张局势和对人民中国进行新的挑衅。
    正在新港休假的美国总统艾森豪威尔已决定把在华盛顿的国务卿杜勒斯召到新港，同他讨论所谓台湾地区的“严重局势”问题，也就是讨论美国阻挠中国人民解放台湾的办法。艾森豪威尔1日和2日还曾经就这个问题同杜勒斯通了三次电话。据说，艾森豪威尔现在正在考虑发表一项“强硬声明”，对中国人民进行新的恫吓。
    杜勒斯3日也同国防部长麦克耳罗伊、国防部副部长卡利斯以及参谋长联席会议主席特文宁举行会谈。据麦克耳罗伊说，他们考虑了美国“在远东采取行动”的各种可能性。
    在这以前，麦克耳罗伊露骨地对决心解放台湾的中国人民进行了挑衅。他在出席在芝加哥举行的美国退伍军人团代表大会后回到华盛顿时对记者说，美国的目的是动员在西太平洋的力量来“遏制”中国，第七舰队正在加强，战术空军司令部所属的一些部队已调往远东，“如果中国人是聪明的，他们将会住手”。
    杜勒斯本月2日还同参谋长联席会议成员举行了一次会议。国务院后来就这个会议发表声明说，美国认为台湾地区“局势严重”。声明企图把造成台湾地区紧张局势的原因说成是中国人民“为追求他们的领土的目标而在台湾海峡一般地区继续使用武力”。
    杜勒斯3日还就台湾地区局势问题召见了参加美国拼凑的“东南亚条约组织”的七个国家——英国、法国、新西兰、澳大利亚、菲律宾、泰国和巴基斯坦的外交使节，争取这些仆从国家对美国在远东的军事冒险活动的支持。杜勒斯还企图把这些国家拖下水。国务院新闻发布官里普就强调，杜勒斯认为台湾地区局势是同“东南亚条约组织各邻国有关的”。
    据美国空军部宣布，空军副参谋长、前战略空军司令李梅将在4日上午前往台湾进行对中国的挑衅活动。
    新华社4日讯　来自远东各地的消息表明，为了在远东加紧制造紧张局势和扩大在台湾海峡的挑衅活动，美国继续在台湾、菲律宾、冲绳等地集结它的军事力量。
    据美联社记者从菲律宾克拉克空军基地发出的消息透露，美国空军“正悄悄地在西太平洋集结”，“这大概是朝鲜战争以来美国空军力量最大的一次集中”。一位美国空军发言人说，“远东的空军力量正在由战斗机和运输机予以加强”；以克拉克空军基地为中心的美国第十三航空队“已经处于作战准备状态”。
    消息引克拉克空军基地消息灵通人士和马尼拉外交人士的话说，美国空军正在进行一系列调动，“已经或者即将加强克拉克基地、台湾和冲绳的空军战斗单位”。
    另据台北消息：“美国台湾防御司令部”司令斯摩特3日在记者招待会上说，美国给予蒋介石集团的军事“援助正在来到”。
    同一天，在台湾进行了阴谋活动后从台北动身回汉城去的李承晚集团的参谋长联席会议主席刘载兴说，他同蒋介石“讨论了许多计划”。为了配合美蒋集团扩大在台湾海峡的挑衅活动，他还公然叫嚣说，李承晚集团“有可能”进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。同时李承晚的空军部长张德昌也在汉城扬言，李承晚的空军正处于所谓“不断戒备状态”。
