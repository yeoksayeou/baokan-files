    Hurry and Seize Ores
    Currently, the iron smelting front is facing a situation where the ore supply cannot keep up. To ensure that hundreds of thousands of furnaces are constantly fed, the quantity of "digging" and "transporting" must be enormous; the arduousness of the work can be imagined. Moreover, we cannot always just eat what we dig and transport on the same day. To prevent temporary interruptions in any one link, and to prepare for the increase in furnace consumption as iron smelting levels improve, each furnace must have sufficient ore reserves. Besides, the weather is getting colder day by day, and the conditions for mining and transportation will be worse than now. Therefore, starting early to seize more ore is an urgent task on the steel front.
    To seize ore, the most important thing is to seize it accurately. It is not enough to simply mobilize tens of thousands of people to go up the mountains. If the ore is not clearly identified, and a great deal of effort is spent transporting what turns out to be mostly gravel or low-grade ore to the furnace, it will only result in a waste of labor. To seize accurately, we must learn from the practice of Jilin Province, concentrate our forces on reliable mining points, and first consume high-grade and rich ore.
    To seize ore, we must seize it in large quantities and quickly, and also improve mining methods. Yuci Special District in Shanxi Province expended great effort in procuring high-efficiency tools for mining, which is a very important experience. At present, most areas are mining with backward tools, and efficiency is very low. If we do not quickly launch a mass movement to reform tools and improve mining methods, it will be impossible to guarantee catching up with the needs of iron smelting, as the mining tasks become heavier day by day.
    The steel production increase demands that pig iron production must rise; as pig iron production rises, transportation, coke, ore, refractory materials, explosives, pit props, and tools all become strained. Does this succession of problems arising mean that the leadership lacked foresight and did not make arrangements early on? We say, we cannot look at it that way. This tension is because our speed of advance is too fast, so new problems and new contradictions naturally come especially quickly. For these new problems and new contradictions, we must use the method of shock tactics, the method of fighting a battle to meet them and solve them. Tension, that is revolution. If everything is arranged perfectly, without any hurry, what revolutionary speed could be created? This year is a year of unprecedented Great Leap Forward, and this leap forward is achieved through tension. Will tension kill people, make them sick, or make fat people thin? It seems that the vast majority of people will not be affected in this way. On the contrary, the facts of this year have precisely proven that the more tense people are, the healthier their spirit and body become, and the more cheerful their mood becomes.
    Now the people of the whole country are enthusiastically throwing themselves into the steel front, carrying out tense battles. We cheer for this tension, we cheer long live the high speed of the revolution!

### 赶快抓矿石

    赶快抓矿石
    目前，炼铁战线上出现矿石供应跟不上的局面。要保证几十万座炉子不断口粮，“挖”和“运”的数量就很庞大；工作的艰巨，也就可以想见。而且，我们不能老是当天吃，当天挖，当天运，为了预防某一个环节的暂时中断，为了准备应付炼铁水平提高以后炉子食量的增加，每一座炉子都必须有足够的矿石储备。何况现在天气一天天地在冷起来，以后挖矿和运输的条件都要比现在差。因此，及早下手多抓矿石，是当前钢铁战线上一项紧急任务。
    抓矿石，最重要的就是要抓得准。光是动员多少万人上山是不够的，如果没有把矿石弄清楚，费很大劲运到炉边，却发现很多是杂石或者是品位很低的矿，结果反而造成劳动力的浪费。为了抓得准，就要学习吉林省的做法，把力量集中到可靠的矿点上，首先吃肥矿、富矿。
    抓矿石，要抓得多，抓得快，还要改进挖矿的方法。山西榆次专区用了很大的力量为采矿筹措效率高的工具，这是一个很重要的经验。现在大部分地区都是用落后的工具采矿，效率很低；今后采矿的任务一天比一天加重，如不很快开展一个改革工具、改进采矿方法的群众运动，也就不可能保证赶上炼铁的需要。
    钢产量要加番，就逼着生铁要长上去；生铁一上去，接着运输、焦炭、矿石、耐火材料、炸药、坑木、工具等都紧张起来了。这样一个问题接着一个问题地逼上来，是不是因为领导上缺乏预见，没有早作安排呢？我们说，不能这样看。这种紧张，是因为我们前进的速度太快，于是新问题、新矛盾自然也就来得特别快。对于这些新问题、新矛盾，我们就要用突击的办法，用打仗的办法来迎接它、解决它。紧张，这就是革命。什么事情都安排得妥妥贴贴，不慌不忙，那还能创造出什么革命的速度呢？今年是空前大跃进的一年，这跃进就是靠紧张来实现的。紧张，会不会死人，会不会累病，会不会使胖子变瘦呢？想来，绝大部分人是不会的，相反，这一年来的事实恰恰证明，越是紧张，人的精神和身体倒越是健康，心情倒越是畅快。
    现在全国人民都热情地投到钢铁战线，进行着紧张的战斗。我们欢呼这种紧张，欢呼革命的高速度万岁！
