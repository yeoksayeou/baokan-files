    The upsurge of the literacy campaign in Shanxi Province emerged with the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. Since last winter and this spring, the farmers' demand for learning culture in various places has been very urgent. Party committees at all levels in the province have grasped culture while grasping production, and established literacy headquarters from the province to the townships. Various places have widely absorbed intellectuals in the countryside, middle and primary school students, primary school teachers, and literacy graduates to undertake teaching work, and carried out various forms of contracted teaching and learning activities according to the characteristics of production.

This spring, various places adopted the method of mobilizing the whole party and the whole people to carry out mass movements on a large scale, especially while running agricultural middle schools and primary schools on a large scale, setting off an upsurge of literacy campaigns. Local leaders have made unified arrangements for both production and literacy. In order to consolidate the results of literacy, spare-time cultural and technical schools have been widely established in various places. An upsurge of the whole people learning technology and the whole people learning culture has emerged on the basis of literacy.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th: The Guangdong Provincial Department of Education officially announced on the 27th that Guangdong Province has become a basically illiteracy-free province.

At present, the number of non-illiterate young and middle-aged people in the province has increased to 88.4%.
    The masses in Guangdong Province who have been freed from illiteracy generally know 1,500 to 3,000 characters and can read popular books and newspapers.
