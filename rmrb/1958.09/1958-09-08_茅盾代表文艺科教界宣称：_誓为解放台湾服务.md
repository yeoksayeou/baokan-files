　　Mao Dun, representing the literary, art, science, and education circles, declares:
　　Vow to serve the liberation of Taiwan
    We resolutely support Premier Zhou's statement. The Chinese people's determination to liberate their own territory, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, is unshakable. The military threats and war provocations of the United States cannot frighten the Chinese people. The nation's scientists, educators, cultural workers, and literary and art workers resolutely oppose the US imperialists' criminal acts of aggression against our country's sovereignty.

    We will wholeheartedly obey the leadership of the Party and respond to the military threats and war provocations of the US imperialists with practical actions such as overfulfilling tasks and accelerating the cultural and technological revolutions.

    We must redouble our efforts in ideological remolding, break down superstitions, unleash creativity, and strive to be both red and expert, thoroughly red and deeply expert; summon up our energy, strive for the top, and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    Literary and art workers must create socialist literature and art in a faster, better, and more economical way, serving production and serving the sacred cause of liberating Taiwan!

    We are always ready, when the motherland needs us, to hold a pen in one hand and a gun in the other, to go to the front line and smash the provocations of US imperialism!

    We love peace, but we are never afraid of war. The power of the 650 million people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is invincible. If the American warmongers dare to impose war on us, the Taiwan Strait will be their graveyard!

    Long live our great motherland! Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!

　　茅盾代表文艺科教界宣称：
　　誓为解放台湾服务
    我们坚决拥护周总理的声明。中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和澎湖列岛的决心是不可动摇的。美国的军事威胁和战争挑衅，吓不倒中国人民。全国的科学工作者、教育工作者、文化、文学艺术工作者，坚决地反对美帝国主义的侵犯我国主权的罪恶行为。
    我们要全心全意服从党的领导，用超额完成任务、加速文化革命和技术革命的实际行动，来回答美帝国主义的军事威胁和战争挑衅。
    我们要加倍努力进行思想改造，破除迷信，发挥创造力，争取又红又专、红透专深；鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义。
    文艺工作者要多快好省地创作社会主义文艺，为生产服务，为解放台湾的神圣事业服务！
    我们随时准备着，在祖国需要的时候，一手执笔，一手拿枪，走上前线，粉碎美帝国主义的挑衅！
    我们爱和平，但决不害怕战争，在中国共产党领导下的六亿五千万人民的力量是无敌的。美国战争狂人如果胆敢把战争强加于我，台湾海峡就是它的坟墓！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
