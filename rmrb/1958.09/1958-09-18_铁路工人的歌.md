A Batch of Goods to be Unloaded
(Shandong Kuaishu)
It was said that one day in late August, train No. 242 was about to enter the station. Among them, there was a roller car that couldn't be easily detached and hauled away after being left behind. The duty officer was thinking, he should organize the unloading to be done quickly. But the manpower was insufficient and there were great difficulties, which made the duty officer anxious. Suddenly an idea came to him, why not find the Yang Guozhen loading and unloading team from Shanhaiguan who are here, and ask them to help and jointly implement the general line. The Yang Guozhen team, upon hearing the phrase "goods to be unloaded," dropped their rice bowls and ran forward like arrows. The crew of train No. 242 also joined the battle like fierce tigers. This group of energetic young men instantly became covered in sweat. Each one worked harder and harder, like Wu Song fighting the tiger without stopping. Who would have thought that it would only take ten minutes to unload everything. Each one was dancing and cheering with joy. This section tells the story of the Wanjiatun Station, where the "satellite" created by the unloading battle soared into the sky.
Jinzhou Railway Bureau Tao Yucheng

Be a Good Pioneer
Foot on the Earth, Hands on the Sky, No difficulty before heroes.
Rush to build "rockets" to send "satellites", the railway is a good pioneer.
Zhang Lide

Seizing Time
Everything is for transportation, doubling the work in one operation, to welcome the "National Day" with gifts;
As long as the vehicles turn around quickly, even if all the sweat is shed.
Zhang Guifa

Opening the Way
Steel songs of victory penetrate the clouds, the "pioneer" should lead the way, railway workers show their skills, everyone's enthusiasm is higher than the sky!
Opening roads through mountains, building bridges over rivers, transporting whatever is needed, delivering as soon as it's said.
For the sake of 10.7 million tons of steel, the train races against time.
Qing Yang

Escorting the Marshal
The railway pioneer shows its magical power, the red flag is displayed with endless power:
Opening roads through mountains can subdue tigers, building bridges over rivers can tame dragons;
Weaving a network across the north and south, escorting the marshal to raise the tent.
Chang Chun

Seizing Every Minute
Leap again and again to catch up, road and mine cooperate like brothers, helping each other to support each other, seize every minute and work hard.
Ensure that all coal is transported, doubling the work in one operation.
Overtake Beijing and surpass Luozhan, ensuring safe production and transportation.
Chun Yang

A Satellite
A satellite flies into the sky, ten thousand golden lights shine in the air.
The secretary takes command and plants the red flag, to let the goods move home.
Family members and workers work together, working hard and skillfully.
Regardless of the scorching sun, regardless of the difficulties like high mountains.
Pushing the small cart like fierce tigers, waving the shovel like dancing swords.
The labor battlefield is boiling, smoke and dust fill the sky.
Zhang Lide

    铁路工人的歌
    一场待卸战
    （山东快书）说了个8月下旬有一天，二四二二次列车要进站。其中有个旋子车，甩下以后不能挂走不好办。值班员心里慢慢想，应该组织待卸加紧干。可惜人力不足困难大，急得值班员打转转。忽然一计有、有、有，想起那山海关杨国珍装卸组正
  在这边，何不去找他们帮帮忙共同贯彻
  总路线。杨国珍小组一听待卸这句话，甩下饭碗跑步如箭齐向前，二四二二次列车乘务员，有如猛虎一样来参战。这一群生龙活虎小伙子，霎时累得满头汗。一个个越干越起劲，好像武松打虎不停闲。谁曾想只用十分钟就卸完。一个个跳着舞着真喜欢。这一段说的万家屯站，待卸战斗创造的“卫星”上了
  天。
  锦州铁路局　陶玉琛
  当好先行官脚踏地球手攀天，英雄面前无困难。赶造“火箭”送“卫星”，铁路当好先行官。
        张立德抢时间一切为运输一回作业翻一番，迎接“十一”把礼献；只要车辆快周转，哪怕流尽全身汗。
        张贵发
    先行开道钢铁凯歌贯云霄，“先行官”理应先开道，铁路工人显神手，个个干劲比天高！逢山开路，遇水架桥，缺啥运啥，说到就到。为了1070万吨钢，火车和时间赛跑。
         青扬
    护送元帅把帐升铁路先行显神通，红旗一展力无穷：逢山开路能伏虎，遇水搭桥降蛟龙；天南地北织成网，护送元帅把帐升。
       常春
    分秒必争加紧干一跃再跃迎头赶，路矿协作兄弟般，互相帮助齐支援，分秒必争加劲干。确保煤炭全运完，一次作业翻一番。赶过北京赶骆站，生产运输保安全。
         纯杨
    一颗卫星一颗卫星飞上天，万道金光空中闪。书记挂帅插红旗，要让货物把家搬。家属职工齐动手，苦干实干加巧干。哪管烈日当空照，哪管困难似高山。推起小车赛猛虎，扬起铁锹似舞剑。劳动战场在沸腾，烟雾尘土飞满天。
              张立德
