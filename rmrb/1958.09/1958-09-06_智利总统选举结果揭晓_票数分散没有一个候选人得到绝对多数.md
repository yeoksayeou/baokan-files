　　Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, September 5th: The Chilean presidential election was held on the 4th. According to the final results announced by the Chilean Ministry of Interior this morning, Jorge Alessandri, the candidate supported by Chilean monopoly capital, large landowners, and the United States, is in the lead with 386,192 votes. However, he only received slightly more than 31,000 votes than Salvador Allende, the candidate of the Chilean Patriotic Democratic Forces, who came in second place. Allende received 354,300 votes.

　　The vote counts for the other three candidates are as follows: Eduardo Frei Montalva, the candidate of the Christian Democratic Party, 254,323 votes; Luis Bossay, the candidate of the Radical Party, 189,182 votes; and Antonio Zamorano, an independent candidate, 41,224 votes.

　　Due to the divided vote, no candidate obtained an absolute majority. The Chilean Congress will hold a joint session of both houses within fifty days to decide which of the two candidates with the most votes will serve as president. However, it is generally believed that Alessandri, who only received slightly more than 30,000 votes more, will become president because right-wing parties hold a majority of seats in Congress, and based on past examples.

　　智利总统选举结果揭晓
    票数分散没有一个候选人得到绝对多数
    据新华社5日讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利总统选举在4日举行。根据智利内政部今天上午宣布的最后结果，受到智利垄断资本、大地主和美国支持的候选人亚历山德里领先，他获得了三十八万六千一百九十二票。但是他只比占第二位的智利爱国民主力量的候选人阿伦德多得三万一千多票。阿伦德获得了三十五万四千三百票。
    其他三个候选人得票的情况如下：基督教民主党候选人弗莱，二十五万四千三百二十三票；激进党候选人波萨伊，十八万九千一百八十二票；独立候选人萨莫拉诺，四万一千二百二十四票。
    由于票数分散，没有一个候选人获得绝对多数，将由智利国会两院在五十天内举行联席会议，在得票最多的两个候选人中决定一个担任总统。但是一般认为，由于右翼政党在国会中占了多数席位，而且按照过去的例子，仅仅多得了三万多票的亚历山德里将担任总统。
