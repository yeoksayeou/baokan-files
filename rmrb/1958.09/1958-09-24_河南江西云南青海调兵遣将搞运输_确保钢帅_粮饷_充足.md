Henan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Qinghai Transfer and Deploy Troops to Engage in Transportation
Ensuring Sufficient "Rations" for Steel Commander

    (Our report) Zhengzhou – Henan Province has adopted measures such as mobilizing the entire population and strengthening organizational work to vigorously reverse the tense transportation situation and support the great development of steel production.

    In early September, Henan Province held a conference of commissioners, mayors, and transportation bureau chiefs to implement the spirit of the whole party and the whole people running transportation. Transportation command headquarters were established from the province to the county level. The provincial party committee required that all roads in the mining areas be opened in September. The provincial party committee also made arrangements for the unified mobilization of various transportation tools in the province. The provincial party committee also required the highway departments to promote the experience of Yantai's fixed-point automobile transportation, and the railway departments to promote the comprehensive transportation operation plan. The goods should be ranked in order of importance and urgency; regardless of whether steel has a plan or not, transportation must be guaranteed first.

    Now, Anyang, Xinxiang, Luoyang and other places have used the method of mobilizing the whole people to solve the problem of material backlog at stations. Luoyang City organized automobile transportation divisions, horse-drawn carriage transportation divisions, etc., to implement unified command and unified mobilization. Eight hundred automobiles in seven regions throughout the province have participated in transportation, and more than one million people have participated in road construction.

    (Our report) Nanchang, 23rd – In order to open roads for the "Three Marshals," Jiangxi Province established transportation headquarters at the provincial, regional, and county levels, with the main party and government leaders at all levels serving as commanders-in-chief, to quickly solve problems such as slow transportation and insufficient loading and unloading forces. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee also issued an order to requisition vehicles from agencies, enterprises, groups, schools, etc., to support steel production and transportation.

    Ji'an, Poyang, and other ports actively organized residents, cadres, and students to participate in handling work in their spare time. Ji'an Port used to have a backlog of 10,000 tons of materials, but now there is basically no backlog. Nanchang Port also established a collaboration office to strengthen the collaboration of various departments. The original backlog of 7,000 tons of materials has gradually decreased. The Provincial Automobile Repair Factory, Nanchang Shipyard, and various transportation bureaus are rushing to manufacture automobile trailers. It is estimated that 757 bamboo and wood structured trailers can be made by the end of October. In this way, the automobile transportation force can be doubled.

    (Our report) Kunming, 23rd – Yunnan Province is actively strengthening its leadership over transportation work to support steel production.

    The measures taken by Yunnan Province are: strengthening the balancing of transportation plans and the management and dispatching of transportation capacity. Three types of management methods have been adopted for all self-use vehicles of agencies and enterprises: 1. Unified leadership and management by specialized transportation departments; 2. Under a unified plan, assign certain transportation tasks to the vehicles of agencies and enterprises; 3. Under unified leadership, organize collaborative transportation according to regions (such as factory areas). In order to give full play to the potential of civilian transportation, motor vehicles are generally not used for transportation within 150 kilometers on trunk lines and within 120 kilometers on branch lines, and methods such as ox carts, horse carts, and animal transport are used as much as possible.

    In order to improve transportation efficiency and eliminate the phenomenon of empty vehicles, the relevant departments also stipulated that military vehicles and self-use vehicles of agencies and enterprises in the province traveling inside and outside the province should report to the transportation stations of various starting points when they are traveling empty, requesting allocation of goods, and must not travel empty or freely solicit goods. All stations under the Transportation Bureau have the responsibility to allocate goods for all empty vehicles.

    The training vehicles of the automobile training teams of various garrison units also assist local transportation as much as possible without hindering training tasks.

    (Our report) Xining, 23rd – Qinghai Province is mobilizing automobiles, flatbed carts, and even camels and yaks from all units in the province to transport "rations" for the steel "marshals."

    The Qinghai Provincial People's Committee has established a transportation command, with Deputy Governor Li Fangyuan as the commander-in-chief, and a transportation office composed of personnel drawn from the Transportation Department and relevant departments such as metallurgy, machinery, railways, grain, and commerce.

    In order to guarantee the priorities, in addition to ranking the transportation plans of various units according to their importance and urgency, the Provincial Party Committee also decided that all short-distance transportation that can be undertaken by animal-drawn vehicles should be undertaken by animal-drawn vehicles, so as to free up automobiles for long-distance transportation. The Qinghai Provincial State Farms Bureau system, which has the largest steel smelting task and the most dispersed smelting locations in the province, has decided to mobilize 2,500 camels, yaks, and horses to undertake short-distance transportation from ore and coke production areas to smelting locations, so that all automobiles can be concentrated on the long-distance transportation lines from Xining to various smelting locations, responsible for transporting smelting equipment and other items.

    河南江西云南青海调兵遣将搞运输
    确保钢帅“粮饷”充足
    本报讯　河南省采取全民动员、加强组织工作等办法，大力扭转运输紧张的局面，支持钢铁生产大发展。
    9月初，河南省召开专员、市长、交通局长会议，贯彻了全党全民办交通的精神。从省到县都成立了交通运输指挥部。省委要求各地、市委在9月份把矿区所有公路一律修通。全省各种交通工具的统一调动问题，省委也作了安排。省委还要求公路部门推广烟台汽车定点运输的经验，铁路部门推广运输综合作业方案。货源要按轻重缓急排队；钢铁不管有无计划，首先要保证运输。
    现在，安阳、新乡、洛阳等地已经用全民动员的办法解决了车站物资积压问题。洛阳市组织了汽车运输师、马车运输师等，实行统一指挥，统一调动。全省七个专区已经有八百辆汽车参加运输，一百多万人参加修公路。
    本报南昌23日电　江西省为了给“三大元帅”开辟道路，省、专、县都成立了交通总指挥部，由各级党政主要干部担任总指挥，迅速解决运输迟缓、装卸力量不足等问题。江西省人民委员会还发出了征用机关、企业、团体、学校等车辆支援钢铁生产运输的命令。
    吉安、波阳等港口都积极组织居民、干部和学生等在业余时间参加搬运工作。吉安港过去积压的物资有一万吨，而现在已经基本上没有积压。南昌港也成立了协作办公室，加强各部门的协作，原来积压七千吨物资，现在已经逐渐减少。省汽车修配厂、南昌船舶修造厂以及各运输局都在赶制汽车拖斗，预计到10月底即可制成竹木结构的拖车七百五十七辆。这样，汽车运输力量就可以增加一倍。
    本报昆明23日电　云南省积极加强对交通运输工作的领导，支持钢铁生产。
    云南省采取的措施是：加强运输计划的平衡工作和运输力的管理调度工作。对所有机关企业自用汽车，分别采取了三类管理办法：一、统一归专营运输部门领导管理；二、在统一计划下，分配给机关企业车辆一定的运输任务；三、在统一领导下，依地区（如工厂区）组织协作运输。为了充分发挥民间运输的潜力，凡干线上一百五十公里内的运输和支线上一百二十公里内的运输一般不使用汽车，尽量采用牛马车、驮运等办法运输。
    为了提高运输效率，消灭汽车放空现象，有关部门还规定：行驶省内外的本省的军车、机关企业自用汽车，凡空驶时应向各出发地运输站报到，要求配货，不得空放或自由揽货。运输局所属各站，对所有空驶汽车有责任进行配货。
    各驻军单位的汽车训练队的教练车，在不妨碍教练任务的情况下，也尽量协助地方运输。
    本报西宁23日电　青海省正在调集全省各单位的汽车、大板车，以至骆驼、牦牛等为钢铁“元帅”运输“粮饷”。
    青海省人民委员会已经成立了运输指挥部，由副省长李芳远任总指挥，并由交通厅和冶金、机械、铁路、粮食、商业等有关部门抽调人员组成了运输办公室。
    为了保证重点，除对各单位运输计划分别轻重缓急进行排队外，省委还决定：凡是畜力车能担任的短途运输，一律使用畜力车，以便腾出汽车，进行长途运输。全省钢铁冶炼任务最大、冶炼地点最分散的青海省农垦局系统，已经决定动员二千五百头骆驼、牦牛和马匹担负从矿石、焦炭产地到冶炼地点的短途运输，使全部汽车集中在西宁到各冶炼地点的长途运输线上，负责运送冶炼设备等物品。
