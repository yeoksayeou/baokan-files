(Report from Paris) American Cleveland banker and entrepreneur Cyrus Eaton, after visiting the Soviet Union, met with reporters from Agence France-Presse in Paris on September 10th, on his way back to the United States, and gave a speech on his impressions of his visit to the Soviet Union, as well as the US foreign policy towards the Soviet Union and China. Eaton, who had met with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in the Soviet Union, enthusiastically praised Khrushchev as a "peace lover" in his conversation with AFP reporters. Eaton said that Khrushchev told him, "We need all the best things in modern civilization that contribute to a pleasant life," and he believed Khrushchev's words were sincere.

Eaton said that when he returns to the United States, he hopes to "be able to convince my many friends in the American industrial and financial community that the Russian people—and their government—want peace."

Eaton said that his visits to Moscow and Leningrad had reaffirmed his belief in "the genuine ambitions of the Soviet government and people."

He said, "I am convinced that the Soviet Union now expects to achieve reconciliation with the United States."

Eaton strongly condemned US foreign policy towards the Soviet Union and China. He said, "I think we must let the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China decide their own destiny."

He said, "I think we should now trade on a large scale with these two countries. As far as I am concerned, the companies I am associated with are ready to do business with Russia, and we are prepared to do business with the People's Republic of China if Dulles does not put us in jail."

Eaton added, "The United States was founded on trade, commerce, and industry... The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China can use many of the things our factories produce." He said that he is now conducting research to estimate how many billions of dollars of business can be done.

Eaton said that the Soviet people firmly support their government, and he and his wife found that they "talked more casually than people in the United States."

The American tycoon said: "The only country where people look back to see who is eavesdropping is the United States, and even congressmen who think Dulles is a complete idiot are afraid to say so. It is we who are creating a police state situation."

Eaton said that entrepreneurs in the United States who have contracts with the government suffer from the "dozens of investigations" conducted by various agencies on every employee. "One company's general manager told me that he had his fingerprints taken so many times that his hands were never dry."

Eaton said that when he returns to the United States, he is not afraid of investigations, "I am extremely willing to meet with them whenever they want to talk to me. They are afraid of that. They issued a subpoena once, and then withdrew it. I told Mr. Khrushchev the whole story, and he laughed heartily."

Eaton said that he appeared as a private individual on Soviet television, and his speech was not censored, nor did he have a script. He said, "They didn't know in advance what I was going to say—in the United States, they would first film it or try to find out what I was going to say. I told the Russians that, in my opinion, the two most powerful countries in the world can coexist peacefully."

He said that he expected someone to criticize him for only seeing what Russia wanted him to see, but in fact, "They said to me, what do you want to see, I told them, and I saw everything I wanted to see."

Eaton said, "The biggest mistake we have made in the United States is to believe in the situation of a regime that is somewhat terrifying, to believe that the collapse of this regime is only a matter of time. Anyone who wants to take on the task of fighting 220 million strong people who firmly support their system is completely abnormal."

The entrepreneur said that he had shipped the troika sleigh that Khrushchev gave him to his Arcadia farm in Northfield, Ohio. "I plan to use it on the farm and exhibit it at agricultural exhibitions. The three horses are almost identical."

Eaton also said that Khrushchev made it clear that "he is unwilling to spend astronomical amounts of money on armaments." Eaton said that Khrushchev pointed out to him that the Soviet government's goals are primarily education, housing, better clothes, and food. Eaton said, "This is not a threat to the rest of the world."

Eaton is one of the largest wealthy figures in the United States, and his business includes gas, electricity, steel, coal, rubber, and banking. Eaton advocates peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and he has constantly condemned the US Cold War and war policies. For this reason, the US Congress House Un-American Activities Committee issued a subpoena to summon him.

    伊顿看到了苏联人民和平建设的雄心
    苏联政府要和平并不威胁世界其他地区
    人民有充分自由美国才真是个警察国家
    本报讯　据巴黎消息：美国克利夫兰银行家和企业家赛鲁斯·伊顿9月10日在访问苏联后返国途中经过巴黎时，接见法新社记者就访苏观感以及美国对苏联和中国的外交政策等问题发表谈话。伊顿在苏联曾会见苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，他在对法新社记者的谈话中热情地称赞赫鲁晓夫是“和平爱好者”。伊顿说，赫鲁晓夫对他说：“我们需要一切有助于愉快的生活的现代文明中的最好的东西”，他认为赫鲁晓夫的话是真挚的。
    伊顿说，当他回国以后，他希望“能够说服我在美国的大批工业界和金融界的朋友相信俄国人民——以及他们的政府——是要和平的”。
    伊顿说，他对莫斯科和列宁格勒的访问使他再次相信了“苏联政府和人民的真正雄心”。
    他说：“我确信苏联现在期望同美国取得和解。”
    伊顿有力地谴责了美国对苏联和中国的外交政策。他说：“我认为，我们必须让苏联和中华人民共和国决定它们自己的命运。”
    他说：“我认为现在我们应该同这两个国家大规模进行贸易。就我而言，同我有联系的公司准备同俄国做生意，而且如果我们同中华人民共和国做生意而杜勒斯并不把我们投入监牢的话，我们准备同中华人民共和国做生意。”
    伊顿又说：“美国是靠贸易、商业和工业立国的……苏联和中华人民共和国能够利用我们工厂所生产的许多东西。”他说，他现在正在进行研究，以便估计能够做多少亿美元的生意。
    伊顿说，苏联人是坚决支持他们的政府的，他和他的妻子发现，他们“比在美国的人谈话更随便”。
    这位美国大企业家说：“人们谈话时要回头看谁在偷听的唯一的国家是美国，甚至觉得杜勒斯是十足的笨蛋的议员们也害怕这样说出来。建立警察国家局面的是我们。”
    伊顿说，在美国同政府订合同的企业家苦于各种机构对每一个职工所进行的“几十种调查”。“一家公司的总经理对我说，他打指印打得多到双手一直没有干的时候。”
    伊顿说，当他回美国时，他不害怕调查，“他们不论什么时候要找我谈话，我都极其愿意去见他们。他们害怕这一点。他们有一次发出传票，接着又收回。我把这件事情的始末完全告诉赫鲁晓夫先生，他大笑了一场”。
    伊顿说他曾在苏联电视中以私人身份出现，他的讲话未受检查，也没有讲稿。他说，“他们对于我要讲什么事先并不知道——在美国他们将首先摄成影片或者企图知道我要讲的东西。我对俄国人说，在我看来，世界上最强大的两个国家能够和平共处。”
    他说，他预料有人会批评说，他只会看到俄国希望他看到的东西，但是事实上“他们对我说，你想看什么，我告诉了他们，而我看到了我想看的一切东西”。
    伊顿说，“我们在美国所犯的最大的错误是深信有点恐怖的一个政权的情况，深信这个政权的垮台只是时间问题。谁想担当起同坚决支持自己制度的两亿两千万坚强的人作战的任务，那完全是失常的”。
    这位企业家说，他已把赫鲁晓夫送给他的三马的马车橇运往他在俄亥俄州诺斯菲尔德的阿卡迪阿农场。“我打算在农场上用它，并且在农业展览会上展出。这三匹马差不多一模一样。”
    伊顿又说，赫鲁晓夫清楚表示“他不愿意在军备方面花天文数字的款项”。伊顿说，赫鲁晓夫对他指出苏联政府努力的目标首先是教育、住房、更好的衣服和食物。伊顿说，“这并不是对于世界其余地区的威胁”。
    伊顿是美国最大的富豪之一，他经营的事业有煤气、电力、钢铁、煤、橡胶以及银行等。伊顿主张不同社会制度国家之间和平共处，他曾不断谴责美国的冷战和战争政策。由于这个缘故，美国国会非美活动调查委员会曾经发出传票传讯他。
