Small Area "Satellites" Drive Large-Scale Production Increase
Shou Zhang's Millet and Corn Both Break the 5,000 Catty Mark

(Reported by our newspaper) Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, has achieved an astonishing large-scale high-yield record with tens of thousands of mu of early autumn millet and corn, with average yields exceeding 5,000 catties per mu.

The early autumn millet and corn in Shou Zhang County have been harvested. This year, the county planted more than 52,000 mu of millet, with general yields ranging from several thousand catties to over ten thousand catties per mu. The highest yield reached 21,787 catties, averaging 5,151 catties and 15 taels per mu across the county, a 24-fold increase compared to last year. Similarly, the 14,000 mu of early autumn corn averaged 5,030 catties per mu, a 24.5-fold increase compared to last year. In addition, the corn intercropped in the county's 100,000 mu of spring sweet potato fields yielded an average of 1,300 catties per mu.

Shou Zhang County's ability to achieve high yields on a large scale is primarily due to the thorough mobilization of the masses and the complete criticism of conservatives, implementing production-increasing measures akin to experimental fields across the large fields. From land preparation to harvest, Party organizations at all levels in Shou Zhang County mobilized the masses to speak out and debate to fight against conservative forces, overcoming all obstacles to the widespread implementation of production-increasing measures. For example, before land preparation, they criticized "deep plowing of the land does not lead to thriving crops," during fertilization, they criticized "excessive fertilization burns the crops," and during sowing, they criticized "planting too densely prevents the development of large ears," and so on.

Secondly, all cadres in the county, starting with the county party secretary, vigorously engaged in experimental fields, not in isolation, but by integrating with the masses. All farmland was contracted layer by layer by county, township, commune, and team cadres, responsible to the end; implementing the "eight-determination" method of assigning land plots, crops, yields, work points, measures, technology, time, and personnel to manage, with responsibility signs posted.

Third, field management was carried out thoroughly and practically, implementing regular inspections, evaluations, and red flag competitions. As soon as third-class seedlings were discovered, measures were taken to upgrade them within a limited time. This is how large-scale high yields were achieved.

The results of the great harvest have further encouraged the cadres and masses of Shou Zhang County to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest this year. They are now strengthening the management of autumn fields for late autumn crops.

### 小面积“卫星”带动大面积增产  寿张谷子玉米双破五千大关

    小面积“卫星”带动大面积增产
    寿张谷子玉米双破五千大关
    本报讯　山东省寿张县全县几万亩早秋谷子和玉米，平均亩产都超过了五千斤。获得了惊人的大面积高额丰产纪录。
    寿张县的早秋谷子和玉米已经收获完毕。全县今年种谷子五万二千多亩，一般亩产都在几千斤到万斤以上，最高的达二万一千七百八十七斤，全县平均亩产五千一百五十一斤十五两，比去年增产二十四倍。同样，早秋玉米一万四千亩，平均亩产五千零三十斤，比去年增产二十四倍半。此外，全县十万亩春甘薯地里间作的玉米，平均每亩也收了一千三百斤。
    寿张县能够在大面积上获得高产，首先是由于对群众发动得深入，对保守派批判得彻底，在大田上普遍贯彻了试验田一般的增产措施。从整地到收获，每一阶段寿张县各级党组织都曾发动群众鸣放辩论来和保守势力斗争，克服了在大面积上普遍贯彻增产措施的一切阻碍。如在整地前批驳“土地深翻，庄稼不旺”，在施肥时批驳“施肥过多，庄稼发烧”，播种时批驳“种植太密，不结大穗”等等。
    其次全县干部从县委书记起都大搞了试验田，不是孤立地搞试验田，而是和群众打成一片，所有农田由县、乡、社、队干部层层包干，负责到底；实行了定地块、定作物、定产量、定工分、定措施、定技术、定时间、定人管的“八定”插牌负责办法。
    第三，田间管理工作抓得深入切实，实行了定期检查评比和开展了红旗竞赛，一发现三类苗就采取措施，限期升级。这样才取得了大面积的高产。
    大丰收的成果更加鼓舞了寿张县干部和群众争取今年全面大丰收的干劲。现在他们正在加强晚秋的秋田管理工作。
