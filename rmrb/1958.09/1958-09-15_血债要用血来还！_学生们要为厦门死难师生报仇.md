Blood debt must be repaid with blood!
Students will avenge the murdered teachers and students of Xiamen

The heinous American imperialists, disregarding the repeated warnings of our government, have repeatedly violated our country's airspace and territorial waters. We have long been unable to suppress the anger in our hearts towards the provocative actions of the American aggressors. Recently, the artillery of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the running dogs of American imperialism entrenched in Kinmen, inhumanely shelled Xiamen No. 3 Middle School, Xiamen University, and peaceful residents, further arousing the boundless anger of our school's teachers, students, and staff. On September 12, our school's entire body of teachers, students, and staff held a meeting to lodge a serious protest against the Chiang bandits' disastrous and harmful actions. Blood debt must be repaid with blood. We must demand repayment of the blood debt from the Chiang bandit army under the wings of American imperialism. We are determined to support the People's Liberation Army in severely punishing the aggressors with the practical action of a 20-day school-run factory campaign, and to extend our warm regards to the teachers and students of Xiamen University who have suffered damage. We once again issue a solemn oath that if the American aggressors do not quickly pull back from the brink, we are determined to tightly grasp the noose made and placed around their own necks by the Americans themselves, strangle the aggressors to death, and let them be buried in the belly of the fish. When the motherland calls, we will definitely put down our pens and pick up our guns, standing on the front line of defending the motherland.

When the news of the Kinmen Chiang bandit army shelling our Xiamen University came, the entire faculty and students of the Department of Physics at Nankai University felt an irrepressible anger. We will avenge our brothers! We will demand repayment of this blood debt!
In order to resist the aggressors and defend the motherland, all of the more than 700 teachers and students in our department have been armed, and a Red Flag Battalion has been established, intensifying training to await the call of the motherland. At present, we are actively carrying out scientific research and running factories in a big way. We must transform anger into strength, treat the laboratory as a battlefield, use instruments as weapons, and products as bullets, determined to severely strike the aggressors with practical actions. Under the impact of the anti-aggression flames of anger, we must accelerate the pace of the Great Leap Forward even faster. Many tasks that should have been completed by "October 1st" must be completed half a month or ten days earlier. Our "Red Flag" steel plant, which produces 20,000 tons of high-quality steel and nearly 60,000 tons of steel annually, must also move at a faster pace. We know that time is steel, and steel is artillery shells. We are determined to produce steel ahead of schedule before "October 1st." In carrying out scientific research in a big way, we have already achieved brilliant results. We vow to catch up with the international level! Let the aggressors taste the artillery shells fired by our communist university!

    血债要用血来还！
    学生们要为厦门死难师生报仇
    罪恶滔天的美帝国主义，不顾我国政府的再三警告，多次侵犯我国领空领海。我们对美国侵略者的这种挑衅行为，早已抑止不住心中的怒火。最近，窃据金门的美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石卖国集团的炮兵，惨无人道地炮击我厦门第三中学、厦门大学和和平居民，更激起了我校师生员工的无比愤怒。9月12日我校全体师生员工集会，对于蒋贼军这种祸国殃民的罪恶行为提出严重抗议。血债要用血来还。一定要向美帝国主义卵翼下的蒋贼军讨还血债。我们决心用苦战二十天学校工厂化的实际行动，支援人民解放军给侵略者以严重惩罚，并向遭受损害的厦门大学师生致以亲切的慰问。我们再一次发出庄严的誓言，如果美国侵略者不赶快悬崖勒马，就决心紧紧抓住美国自制的并且自己套在自己脖子上的绞索，勒死侵略者，叫他们葬身鱼腹。当祖国召唤的时候，我们一定放下笔杆拿起枪杆，站在保卫祖国的最前线。

    当金门蒋贼军炮击我厦门大学的消息传来后，我们南开大学物理系全体师生感到抑制不住的愤怒。我们要为我们的兄弟报仇雪恨！我们要讨还这笔血债！
    为了抗击侵略者，为了保卫祖国，我们全系七百多名师生已经全部武装，成立了红旗营，加紧操练听候祖国召唤。目前，我们正积极进行科学研究，大办工厂，我们要把愤怒化为力量，把实验室当作战场，以仪器当武器，以产品当子弹，决心以实际行动狠狠打击侵略者。我们要在反侵略怒火的冲击下，把跃进的步伐加快再加快，很多应在“十一”才完成的任务都要提前半月或十天完成。我们年产二万吨优质钢和近六万吨钢的“红旗”钢厂，也更要快马加鞭。我们知道时间就是钢，钢就是炮弹，我们决心在“十一”前提前出钢。在大搞科学研究中，我们已获得了辉煌成果。我们发誓要追上国际水平！让侵略者尝尝我们共产主义大学射出的炮弹！
    南开大学物理系全体师生
