Our hearts are like ten thousand rockets flying forward, carrying the blazing light of anger. We have issued you a serious warning once, twice... seven, eight times repeatedly. You still dare to harass and be rampant at our doorstep! You should have known the Western proverb: "God wants to destroy a person, he must first make him mad." Only madmen cannot hear the roar of the two giants, China and the Soviet Union, and the righteous people of the world, and cannot see the heroic appearance of the Chinese people today: hundreds of millions of angry hearts, transformed into infinite power, dense crops, rolling golden waves for thousands of miles, the blazing fire of the blast furnace, surpassing the scorching sun in the high sky, hundreds of millions of militia teams, building an iron wall! Our earth-shattering slogan is: In order to eliminate this crazy robber, we are always ready, to have steel if we need steel, to have food if we need food!
Our hearts are like ten thousand rockets flying forward, carrying the blazing light of anger. We follow the soaring silver swallows, reconnoitering and circling in the sky of the motherland; we and the sailors on the gunboats gaze at the sea and sky together, every shell pointing at the chest of the robber!
Dog robber! Death is imminent, stop showing off! Six hundred million angry people are rubbing their fists and wiping their palms, waiting for an order to push you all into the bottomless abyss!

Beijing, September 21, 1958

    我们的心像万根火箭飞向前方
    冰心我们的心像万根火箭飞向前方，挟带着白热的怒火的光芒，我们对你发出一次，两次……七次，八次的反复严重的警告，你还敢在我们家门口骚扰，猖狂！你们该早知道西方的谚语：上帝要消灭一个人，必先使他疯狂。只有疯子才听不见中苏两位巨人和世界正义人民的怒吼，才看不见今天中国人民的英雄模样：亿万愤怒的心，化成为无穷的力量，繁密的庄稼，滚着万里金黄的波浪，高炉的烈火，胜过高天炽红的太阳，亿万个民兵队伍，砌成铁壁铜墙！我们震天的口号是：为了消灭这疯狂的狗盗，我们时刻准备着，要钢有钢，要粮有粮！我们的心像万根火箭飞向前方，挟带着白热的怒火的光芒。我们追随着上腾的银燕，在祖国的天空上侦察，盘旋；我们和炮舰上的水兵一同向着海天凝望，每一颗炮弹都指向强盗的胸膛！狗强盗！死在眉睫，休再逞强！六亿愤怒的人民在磨拳擦掌，只待一声令下，就要把你们一齐推下无底的深渊！
