　　Supervise Each Other, Learn From Each Other, Improve Together
　　Set an Example for the Sanitation Work of Large Cities
　　Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin Mutual Inspection of Health Work Has Ended
Xinhua News Agency: The work of mutual inspection of sanitation by delegations from Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin has ended. The inspection results prove that the sanitation work in the three cities has made significant progress since the launch of the competition. During the inspection process, they not only exchanged experiences with each other, but also put forward many suggestions to each other.
　　The Tianjin and Shanghai inspection groups were warmly welcomed by the people of Beijing when they inspected Beijing. The two inspection groups believed that the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene in the capital had been carried out more thoroughly, the masses were full of enthusiasm, environmental sanitation had been greatly improved, the four pests had been basically eliminated in the urban area, and diseases had been significantly reduced. When they inspected the Yongdingmen Fresh Fruit Market, which covers an area of more than 150 mu, and the reed ponds and standing water near the Jade Belt Bridge in the Summer Palace, each member of the inspection group exposed their arms, rolled up their trouser legs, and sat next to the reed pond for more than half an hour to test, and did not find a single fly or mosquito. The inspection group praised this as an international miracle. The inspection group believed that the emergence of many advanced units and regions in sanitation work in Beijing once again shows that only when publicity work is carried out extensively and thoroughly, and is known to every household, can a mass movement be carried out extensively and thoroughly. The good sanitation work in many areas and units such as Yongfengtun Township in Changping District is because the masses have been mobilized. Many units have made unified arrangements for production and sanitation work, and sanitation work not only does not conflict with production, but also ensures the double leap forward in production and sanitation. For example, the No. 1 construction site of the Military Commission Engineering Company completes sanitation work as a task while planning, arranging, and inspecting production. The attendance rate of this company reached 99.8%. The inspection group believed that the sanitation work achievements in areas with simple conditions such as the Tianqiao area, the Taoyuan residential area with low houses, and the No. 3 Fur Making Factory were a powerful rebuttal to "conditionists." The inspection group hoped that Beijing would also make sanitation work systematic and regular, and eliminate the imbalance in sanitation work. They suggested that Beijing continue to put forward new requirements on the existing basis to continuously improve the sanitation movement centered on eliminating the four pests.
　　When the Shanghai and Beijing inspection groups inspected Tianjin, they were particularly impressed by Tianjin's environmental sanitation, especially the sanitation of service industries. They found that due to the improvement of sanitation in this area, the incidence of infectious diseases in Tianjin this year has been greatly reduced. The inspection group expressed satisfaction with several outstanding units, including the Tianjin Ink Factory. This factory combined production with large-scale sanitation campaigns. Since 1957, there have been no influenza patients in the factory, and no dysentery patients this year, which greatly improved the attendance rate of workers. The inspection group believed that the reason why Tianjin achieved great success in sanitation work was mainly because the people responded to the call of the Party and turned the patriotic health movement into a conscious action. The inspection group hoped that relevant departments in Tianjin would further strengthen scientific research and technical guidance on eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene.
　　When the Beijing and Tianjin inspection groups inspected Shanghai, they found that many factories and suburban agricultural cooperatives in Shanghai had made great achievements under the guidance of the idea of "sanitation for production, and production for sanitation." The Livestock Products Export Company's processing and finishing plant promoted technological innovation through the sanitation movement and created a pig bristle separator to replace manual operation, fundamentally changing the serious harm to workers' health and extremely unsanitary conditions for more than 100 years. In just four months, Shanghai mobilized millions of citizens to basically complete the treatment of the city's stinking water banks, which breed mosquitoes. Many factories have included sanitation work in their production plans and established safety and sanitation officers, workshop cleaning handover systems, etc., in combination with production characteristics, which are all good methods. They believed that Shanghai has many advanced models of sanitation work. However, next to these advanced models, there are still backward units. The inspection group believed that Shanghai should study how to make the advanced more advanced and the backward catch up quickly.
　　After the inspection, the relevant leading departments and masses in the three cities are continuing to work hard based on the opinions put forward by the inspection group to push the sanitation work to a new climax. Tianjin has already taken action. Many inspected units have worked hard for several days to correct shortcomings. All seven districts in the city have made arrangements to overcome the weak links in the sanitation movement based on the opinions put forward by the inspection group in order to welcome the large-scale inspection of the four provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi.

　　互相督促  彼此学习  共同提高
　　为大城市卫生工作树立榜样
　　北京、上海、天津互相检查卫生工作已经结束
    本报讯　北京、上海、天津三个城市互派代表团检查卫生的工作已经结束。检查结果证明，三个城市的卫生工作在开展竞赛以后，都有显著的进步。在检查过程中，不但互相交流了经验，还彼此提出了许多的意见。
    天津、上海的检查团在北京检查时，受到北京人民的热烈欢迎。两个检查团认为首都除四害讲卫生运动开展得比较深入，群众干劲十足，环境卫生大有改进，城区基本上消灭了四害，疾病显著减少。他们在方圆一百五十多亩地的永定门鲜果市场和颐和园玉带桥附近的苇塘和积水旁检查时，检查团人员每人都露出胳膊，卷起裤管，坐在苇塘旁边作了半个多小时的试验，没有发现一个苍蝇和蚊子，检查团称赞这是国际上的奇迹。检查团认为，北京出现了许多卫生工作的先进单位和地区，再一次说明只有宣传工作作到广泛深入，家喻户晓，才会广泛深入地开展群众性的运动。昌平区永丰屯乡等许多地区和单位卫生工作好，就是因为群众发动起来了。不少单位把生产和卫生工作作了统一安排，卫生工作不仅和生产没有矛盾，而且保证了生产卫生双跃进。如军委工程公司第一工地在计划、布置、检查生产的同时，把卫生工作也作为一项任务来完成。这个公司出勤率达到了99.8％。检查团认为从条件简陋的天桥一带地区、矮屋群的桃园居民区和皮毛裁制三厂等地区卫生工作成绩，对“条件论者”是一个有力的反驳。检查团希望北京市对卫生工作还要做到制度化和经常化，消灭卫生工作的不平衡现象。他们建议北京市在现有的基础上不断提出新的要求，使以除四害为中心的卫生运动不断提高。
    上海和北京的检查团在天津检查时，对天津的环境卫生，尤其是对服务性行业的卫生情况印象特别深。他们发现，由于这方面卫生情况的改善，使得天津今年的传染病发病率大大降低。检查团对几个突出的单位表示满意，其中有天津墨水厂，这个厂结合生产大搞卫生运动，从1957年以来，全厂没有流行性感冒患者，今年没有痢疾患者，从而大大提高工人出勤率。检查团认为天津市卫生工作获得很大成绩的原因，主要是人民群众响应党的号召，把爱国卫生运动变成自觉的行动了。检查团希望天津市有关部门进一步加强有关除四害讲卫生的科学研究工作和技术指导。
    北京和天津的检查团在上海检查时，发现上海的许多工厂和郊区农业社在“卫生为生产，生产讲卫生”的思想指导下，做出了很大的成绩。畜产品出口公司加工整理厂，由卫生运动推动技术革新，创造了代替手工操作的猪鬃分离机，根本改变了一百多年来严重危害工人健康和极不卫生的情况。在短短四个月中，上海市发动百万市民，基本治理完成了孳生蚊子的全市的臭水滨工程。不少工厂把卫生工作列入生产计划，结合生产特点建立安全卫生员、车间清洁交接班制度等，都是很好的办法。他们认为，上海有许多卫生工作先进的典型。但是，在这些先进典型的紧邻，还有落后的单位。检查团认为上海市应研究怎样使先进更先进，使落后的迅速赶上去。
    经过检查后，三个城市的有关领导部门和群众，都在根据检查团提出的意见，继续鼓足干劲，要把卫生工作推向新的高潮。天津市已经行动起来了，许多被检查的单位连续苦战几天，改正了缺点，市内七个区都作了布置，根据检查团提出的意见，克服卫生运动中的薄弱环节，以迎接河北、河南、山东、山西四省的大检查。
