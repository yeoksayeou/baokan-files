\tAnshan Iron and Steel Company Strives to Put Two Open-Hearth Furnaces and One Blast Furnace into Production Ahead of Schedule

\tBaotou Iron and Steel Company Concentrates Efforts to Accelerate the Progress of Key Projects

\tChongqing's Major Iron and Steel Enterprises Try Their Best to Shorten Construction Time

\t(Our Newspaper's Report) The builders of Anshan Iron and Steel Company recently revised their construction plans, advancing the dates for putting key construction projects such as steelmaking and ironmaking into production once again. This will play a significant role in Anshan Iron and Steel Company's effort to complete this year's great leap forward in steel production.

\tThe workers who are building two of China's largest stationary open-hearth furnaces recently revised their leap forward plan for the fifth time, guaranteeing that these two large open-hearth furnaces, originally scheduled to start production in the second quarter of next year, will be put into production four and five months ahead of schedule, playing a role in the great task of doubling steel production this year, increasing steel production by more than 80,000 tons by the end of the year. After discussing this inspiring plan, the workers at the construction site immediately threw themselves into intense battle. Chimney workers have doubled their chimney-building efficiency through hard work and improved operating techniques. Workers from the Metallurgical Furnace Repair Plant, who were originally responsible for open-hearth furnace repairs, also participated in the construction of the large open-hearth furnaces and created the excellent achievement of building two regenerators with 40,000 refractory bricks in seven days.

\tThe builders of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 10 Blast Furnace, one of China's largest blast furnaces, once boldly proposed two months ago to build this blast furnace in six months, creating a new record for the construction of large blast furnaces. Although the construction workload of digging 150,000 cubic meters of earth was added later, they recently proposed to shorten the construction period by another month, so that No. 10 Blast Furnace would produce more than 80,000 tons of molten iron this year. Now, at this construction site where the first cubic meter of earth was dug up just over two months ago, the outer shell of the giant blast furnace with a diameter of nine meters has been installed to a height of several meters. In the course of construction, high records of pouring 3,200 cubic meters of concrete in 22 hours and installing a tower crane in 20 days were also created. (Lou Baoheng)

\t(Our Newspaper's Report) Baotou Iron and Steel Company concentrates materials, equipment and construction forces to accelerate the progress of key projects.

\tSince the second quarter of this year, the construction of Baotou Iron and Steel Company has been fully launched. Due to the difficulty of insufficient supply of building materials and equipment, only about 50% of the annual leap forward plan had been completed by the end of August. In order to reverse this situation, the Party and government leaders of Baotou Iron and Steel Company recently took a series of emergency measures and mobilized all employees to carry out industrial "drought resistance". They cleaned up and concentrated building materials and equipment to meet the needs of key projects such as the iron ore mine's primary crushing plant, blast furnace, coke oven, and water source. At the same time, skilled technicians were concentrated on key projects to accelerate the progress of these projects. They also tried every means to save raw materials. In the water source project, it was decided to replace steel pipes with high-strength prestressed reinforced concrete pipes, which would save 7,000 tons of steel pipes for one water supply pipeline. (Yang Feng)

\t(Our Newspaper's Report) The new construction and expansion projects of Chongqing's five major iron and steel enterprises are accelerating. Recently, all factories have taken measures to shorten the construction period and strive to complete the majority of the main projects ahead of schedule next year. From September this year, some of the main workshops in each steel plant will be put into production in batches. As a result, the city's steelmaking capacity will increase by about one million tons this year.

\tChongqing's five newly built and expanded iron and steel enterprises include a large iron and steel complex, two medium-sized steel plants and two small enterprises. After the completion of all engineering construction, Chongqing will have a series of modern iron and steel production equipment for steelmaking, ironmaking, rolling steel, and coking. The output of steel alone will increase by about ten times compared with 1957.

\tChongqing Iron and Steel Company has revised its construction plan several times this year. They started with modifying the design and strengthening construction, on the one hand, to save funds and expand the scale of construction, and on the other hand, to greatly accelerate the progress of construction, shortening the original five-year construction time by more than two and a half years. From September, the company will put into production steelmaking equipment with an annual output of more than 600,000 tons of steel in succession.

\tChongqing No. 3 Steel Plant, Beibei Steel Plant, and other factories are making rapid progress in construction with the support of various factories and mines and relevant departments in Chongqing. After the newly built open-hearth furnace of Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant began production, it is stepping up the installation of continuous casting machines and seamless steel pipe rolling mills, striving to put them into production before National Day. Although the Beibei Steel Plant has not been started for long, two blast furnaces will be put into production in the first quarter of this year. (Lü Xilin)

### 让更多的高炉平炉早日参战

    让更多的高炉平炉早日参战
    鞍钢力争两座平炉一座高炉提前生产
    包钢集中力量加快重点工程建设进度
    重庆主要钢铁企业尽力压缩施工日期
    本报讯　鞍山钢铁公司的建设者最近重新修改了建设计划，把正在建设的炼钢、炼铁等重点工程投入生产的日期再一次提前。这将对鞍钢完成今年钢铁生产跃进计划发生重大作用。
    正在建设两座我国最大的固定式平炉的职工们，最近第五次修改了跃进计划，保证让这两座原定明年第二季度开工生产的大型平炉，提前四个月和五个月投入生产，在今年实现钢产量翻一番的伟大任务中发挥作用，到年底增产八万多吨钢。工地的职工们在讨论完这个振奋人心的计划以后，立即投入了紧张的战斗。烟囱工人经过大干苦干和改善操作技术，已把砌烟囱的效率提高一倍左右。原来担任平炉检修任务的冶金炉修理厂的工人，也参加了大平炉的建设工作，还创造了七天用四万块耐火砖砌成两个蓄热室的优异成绩。
    我国最大的高炉之一——鞍钢十号高炉的建设者，在两个月前曾经豪迈地提出要用六个月的时间建成这座高炉，创造一个建设大型高炉的新纪录。虽然以后在建设过程中，追加了挖土十五万立方公尺的工程量，但是他们最近又提出要将工期再缩短一个月，使十号高炉今年流出八万多吨铁水。现在，在这个两个多月前才挖起第一方土的工地上，直径九公尺的巨型高炉的外壳已经安装到几丈高，在建设过程中还创造了二十二小时浇灌三千二百立方公尺混凝土、二十天安装一台塔式起重机的高纪录。　　（楼葆蘅）
    本报讯　包头钢铁公司集中材料、设备和施工力量，加速重点工程的施工进度。
    从今年第二季度起，包钢的建设已全面铺开，由于遇到了建筑材料和设备供应不足的困难，到8月底仅完成全年跃进计划的50％左右。为了扭转这种局面，包钢党、政领导最近采取了一系列紧急措施，发动全体职工进行工业“抗旱”。他们把建筑材料和设备清理、集中，首先满足铁矿山初破碎厂、高炉、焦炉、水源地等重点工程的需要。同时把熟练的技术工人集中到重点工程上，加速这些工程的进展。他们还想尽一切办法，节约原材料。在水源地工程上，决定用高强度预应力钢筋混凝土管代替钢管，一条输水管线就可以节省钢管七千吨。

    本报讯　重庆市五个主要钢铁企业的新建、扩建工程正在加速进行。最近，各厂都采取措施努力压缩施工日期，力争绝大部分主要工程提前在明年完工。从今年9月份起，各钢铁厂都有一部分主要车间分批投入生产。全市今年炼钢生产能力将因此增加一百万吨左右。
    重庆市新建、扩建的这五个钢铁企业，包括一个大型钢铁联合企业，两个中等规模的钢铁厂和两个小型企业。全部工程建设完工后，重庆市将拥有炼钢、炼铁、轧钢、炼焦等一系列现代化钢铁生产设备，其中仅钢的产量就要比1957年增加十倍左右。
    重庆钢铁公司今年几次修订了建设计划。他们从修改设计和加强施工着手，一方面节约资金扩大建设规模，一方面大大加快建设进度，将原定五年的建设时间缩短两年半以上。从9月份起，这个公司就将有年产六十万吨钢以上的炼钢设备陆续投入生产。
    重庆第三钢铁厂、北碚钢铁厂等，在重庆市各厂矿和有关部门的支援下，施工进展很快。重庆第三钢铁厂继新建平炉开始生产以后，正在加紧安装连续铸锭机和无缝钢管轧钢机，争取国庆节前投入生产。北碚钢铁厂虽然开工不久，今年第四季度初也将有两座高炉开始生产。　（吕希林）
