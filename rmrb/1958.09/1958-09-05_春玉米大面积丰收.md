Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 4th: Following the bumper harvest of early rice, Jiangsu Province has raised another red flag for a large-scale bumper harvest of early corn. At present, all 6,398,800 mu of early corn in Jiangsu Province have been harvested, with a total output of 3,311,213,000 jin. Among them, single-cropped corn accounted for 1,247,200 mu, with an average yield of 681 jin per mu; intercropped corn accounted for 5,151,600 mu, with an average yield of 478 jin per mu. According to the statistical methods stipulated by the State Statistical Bureau, deducting the area of intercropped with other crops and calculating based on the actual area planted with corn, the actual early corn area in the province is 4,177,200 mu, with an average yield of 793 jin per mu, an increase of 3.24 times compared to last year's yield of 186 jin per mu. The total output also increased by 90% compared to last year's total early and late corn output of 1.74 billion jin (9,050,000 mu). Seven counties, including Chongming, Suining, Huai'an, Pixian, Taixian, Baoying, and Taixing, have achieved early corn yields of over 1,000 jin per mu.

This year, cadres at the county, township, and commune levels in various corn-producing areas personally managed corn experimental plots, setting examples and driving overall progress, which played a very important role in this year's corn yield increase throughout the province. According to incomplete statistics, the area of corn experimental plots in the province reached more than 500,000 mu. After exploring experiences in the experimental plots, they were quickly推广 (tuīguǎng - popularized/promoted) to the masses, and then the experiences of the masses were summarized and applied to the experiments, making the experimental plots a banner, driving the continuous leap forward of large-scale corn production.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 4th: Changge County, Henan Province, famous throughout the country for its deep plowing and deep turning of the soil, achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of 3,302 jin per mu on more than 100,000 mu of early corn this year, and there were also more than 300 mu of "satellite" fields with yields of over 10,000 jin. This year, the county's early corn harvest area was 100,210.5 mu, a decrease of more than 6,062 mu compared to last year, but the total output increased by 994.4% compared to 1957, and the yield per unit area increased by 1227%. The output of early corn alone is 63,985,826 jin more than the county's total annual output last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 4th: Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, planted a total of 78,859 mu of spring corn this year, with a total output of 98,563,893 jin, an average yield of 1,249 jin and 13 liang per mu. Among them, ten villages including Beixiaotun in Hanxinzhuang achieved an average yield of 2,500 to 3,000 jin per mu; the three villages with the most outstanding yield increase, Beixi and Gangshang, achieved an average yield of 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu.

Xinhua News Agency: In Juxian County, Shandong Province, the average yield of more than 100,000 mu of spring corn exceeded 1,000 jin per mu.

This year, Juxian County's spring corn, after measures such as deep plowing, dense planting of improved varieties, fertilization, and irrigation, grew unprecedentedly well, with thick stalks exceeding nine chi (approximately 3 meters) and cobs resembling water buffalo horns. The 100,237 mu yielded a total of 100,285,052 jin, with an average yield of 1,006 jin per mu, an increase of more than 2.3 times compared to last year's spring corn.

　　春玉米大面积丰收
    江苏省—793斤
    据新华社南京4日电　江苏省继早稻大丰收之后，又升起了早玉米大面积丰收的红旗。目前，江苏省六百三十九万八千多亩早玉米已全部收割结束，总产量三十三亿一千二百一十三万斤。其中单作玉米一百二十四万七千二百亩，平均单产六百八十一斤；间作玉米五百一十五万一千六百亩，平均单产四百七十八斤。如果按照国家统计局规定的统计办法，把间作其他作物的面积扣除，按种植玉米实际作用的面积计算，全省折实的早玉米面积为四百一十七万七千二百亩，平均单产七百九十三斤，比去年单产一百八十六斤增产三点二四倍。总产量也比去年全部早晚两季玉米产量十七亿四千万斤（九百零五万亩）增加90％。全省还出现了崇明、睢宁、淮安、邳县、泰县、宝应、泰兴等七个早玉米单产千斤县。
    今年各玉米产区的县、乡、社各级干部都亲自搞玉米试验田，树立样子，带动全面，这对今年全省玉米丰产起着十分重要的作用。据不完全统计，全省玉米试验田面积约达五十万亩以上，在试验田中摸索出经验后，就迅速推广到群众中去，然后把群众的经验加以总结，再应用到试验中，这就使试验田成为旗帜，带动大面积玉米不断跃进。
　　长葛县—3302斤
    据新华社郑州4日电　以深耕深翻土地闻名全国的河南省长葛县，今年十万多亩早玉米获得了亩产三千三百零二斤的大面积丰收，并有三百多亩万斤以上的“卫星”田。今年这个县早玉米收获面积十万零二百一十亩五分，比去年减少六千零六十二亩多，但总产量却比1957年增长994.4％，单位面积产量增产1227％。仅早玉米一项作物产量，就比去年全县全年总产量还多六千三百九十八万五千八百二十六斤。
　　藁城县—1249斤
    据新华社天津4日电　河北省藁城县今年共种春玉米七万八千八百五十九亩，总产量达到九千八百五十六万三千八百九十三斤，平均亩产一千二百四十九斤十三两。其中韩辛庄北小屯等十个村平均亩产二千五百到三千斤；增产最突出的北席、岗上等三个村，平均亩产三千到四千斤。
    莒县—1006斤
    据新华社讯　山东省莒县十万多亩春玉米平均亩产超过千斤。
    今年莒县春玉米经过土地深翻、良种密植、施肥、浇水等措施，生长空前良好，秸秆粗大，超过九尺，棒似水牛角。十万零二千二百三十七亩共收一亿零二百八十五万零五百二十斤，平均亩产一千零六斤，亩产比去年的春玉米增加二点三倍多。
