Whistling in the Dark While Walking Alone at Night
—Notes on Reading the U.S. State Department's Memorandum on Non-Recognition of China
 　　Dù Bō
Editor's Note: American warmongers are currently engaged in frenzied war provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area. Although the Sino-American talks have resumed in Warsaw, all indications show that while negotiating, the United States is continuing to intensify its military deployments to expand aggression in the Taiwan Strait area. At this time, it is very beneficial to re-read the so-called memorandum on non-recognition of China recently published by the U.S. State Department. Observing its actions and examining its words, it becomes even clearer that the U.S. State Department's memorandum is the precursor to a large-scale military provocation by the United States against the Chinese people and the people of all Asian countries.

The U.S. State Department's memorandum on non-recognition of China attempts to justify the U.S. policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and aggression against Asian countries, but it has not succeeded. After the publication of this memorandum, the U.S. government was subjected to fierce criticism from peace-loving people around the world, and even U.S. allies and domestic public opinion ridiculed it. British newspapers believed that the U.S. publication of the memorandum was "blind to a strange degree"; American newspapers said that the memorandum wanted to justify the unpopular policies of the U.S. government, but was full of unconvincing "rotten arguments"! The September 1st issue of the American "New Republic" weekly even published a poem to portray the U.S. memorandum that ignores the reality of China: "Political erosion is fierce, China sinks to the bottom of the sea"; "The former Chinese territory is vast and cannot be found"! This is indeed a great irony!

This lengthy and tedious memorandum, signed by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, goes to great lengths to distort the situation in Asia and the world, makes various absurd and malicious slanders against the great Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, and repeatedly engages in shameless provocations regarding the relationship between Asian countries and our country. But its basic content can be summarized in just two sentences: New China does not exist, and New China is "thoroughly bad"! These absurd and outrageous remarks that completely distort the facts and disregard reality are truly disgusting! Especially coming from the mouth of the American imperialists, who have been battered and bruised in front of the Chinese people, it is simply a case of not knowing the meaning of shame!

If, as the memorandum says, the Chinese government is just a castle in the air, "does not represent the true will and aspirations of the Chinese people," and is a lifeless thing that "will eventually disappear one day," then how could the American aggressive forces have rolled out of mainland China in 1949, along with the Chiang Kai-shek group, which it had equipped with more than six billion U.S. dollars? American aggressive activities in China date back one hundred and seventy-four years from 1784, when the first American merchant ship arrived in China, and one hundred and fourteen years from 1844, when the United States forced China to sign the first unequal treaty. Today, although the United States still occupies our territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, hasn't the vast majority of its bets been lost? The Chinese people, together with the Korean people, also fought against the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield. What was the result? The memorandum states that the United States wasted 142,000 American lives in vain during the war of aggression against Korea (readers note that Dulles greatly reduces the actual number of casualties here), and there are still "various sorrows" when it is remembered. Doesn't this show that the United States gained nothing in the war of aggression against Korea? Moreover, in recent years, the United States has been forcing its allied countries to "impose an embargo" on China, illegally depriving the Chinese people of their rights in the United Nations, and cursing and slandering New China every day, acting very nervous. Why is this?

The Chinese people dare to oppose and despise American imperialism, making it impossible for it to ride on the necks of the Chinese people and do whatever it wants. In the eyes of the American lords, this is called "lack of moral concepts," which is not surprising. However, the entire memorandum, which is more than eight thousand words long, slanders our government from beginning to end, saying that this is not good and that is not good. Isn't this called "lack of moral concepts"? Who gave the U.S. State Department the right to interfere in other people's internal affairs? Whether the Chinese government is good or bad, why should the U.S. State Department, which is on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, ten thousand miles away, judge! China is the China of the Chinese people, and the Chinese government is the government chosen by the Chinese people themselves. China's 600 million people support their own government. The U.S. State Department can do nothing but stare blankly! In the long-term struggle against American imperialism, the Chinese people have found a way to look at problems: whatever American imperialism praises is definitely bad in the eyes of the Chinese people; whatever American imperialism says is bad is definitely good in the eyes of the Chinese people. The U.S. State Department's memorandum has been published in full in Chinese newspapers. Its various slanders and curses against the Chinese government and people have once again allowed the Chinese people to see the shameless face of the American aggressors and have further aroused their spirit of fighting with a common hatred. The U.S. State Department will get nothing!

The memorandum, over and over again, said so much, but it was nothing more than to explain why the U.S. government does not recognize China. However, it exaggerates the role of the U.S. government's recognition or non-recognition of China! According to the memorandum, if the U.S. government recognizes China, it will "enhance China's international status and prestige"; if it does not recognize China, it will be enough to "accelerate" China's "process of disappearance." This is really like the story of the myth of "the walls of Jericho." It seems that as long as the U.S. government blows the horn of "non-recognition" of China with all its might, China's Great Wall will collapse. Isn't this a complete daydream! The U.S. State Department seems to have never thought that the Chinese people simply do not care about any recognition from the United States. Without the recognition of the United States, the Chinese people have lived well in the past nine years and will continue to live better in the future. Whether the United States recognizes it or not will not harm the Chinese people in the slightest. However, Dulles, who signed the memorandum, seems to be very forgetful. In June 1957, he said: "If we (the United States) believe that establishing diplomatic relations with the current (Chinese) regime can promote this demise, then we will establish such relations." This clearly means that if the United States recognizes China and establishes diplomatic relations with China, it will not only not "enhance China's international status and prestige," but the United States will use this diplomatic relationship to continue to interfere in China's internal affairs and engage in subversive activities in China, just as the United States has done or is doing in Iran, Indonesia, Syria, Lebanon, Cuba, Argentina, Venezuela... Fortunately, China is strong, so that Dulles himself does not dare to believe that establishing diplomatic relations with China "can promote this demise" and still dares not recognize China today. So, what's so bad about this for China? The Chinese people have never had any illusions about the so-called recognition of the United States.

However, in the memorandum's defense of the unpopular policy of "not recognizing China," it exposes some basic considerations of the U.S. ruling group regarding so-called foreign policy, which is worth noting. The memorandum frankly admits: "The United States believes that diplomatic recognition is a tool for implementing national policy"; the United States does not recognize China, which can both "accelerate" China's "process of disappearance" and make it "more difficult for China to successfully pursue its foreign policy." For the United States, not recognizing China "makes it easier for the United States to achieve its policy goals in the Far East (note! not just in China)," while recognizing China "would seriously hinder the achievement of these goals." Then, what foreign policy of China does the United States want to make it "more difficult to successfully pursue"? What "policy goals" does the United States want to achieve in the Far East? Why would recognizing China seriously hinder the United States from achieving these goals in the Far East?

The people of the whole world know that since the day of the victory of the Chinese revolution, the Chinese people have been unswervingly pursuing a peaceful foreign policy. Our country, together with India and Burma, advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, actively participated in the Asian-African Conference and the formulation of the Ten Principles of the Asian-African Conference, and has always adhered to these principles. Our country has always lived in peace and friendship with all countries, resolutely supported the national independence movements of Asian, African and Latin American countries, opposed colonialism, and in particular, resolutely struggled against the evil acts of American imperialism in carrying out aggression, creating tension, and threatening peace around the world, in order to defend peace. The United States is hostile to the Chinese people's peaceful foreign policy and tries to make this policy "difficult to successfully pursue." What does this mean? Doesn't it mean that the United States' "policy goals in the Far East" are exactly the opposite of China's, thus nakedly exposing the United States' aggressive ambitions towards Asian countries?

In the memorandum, the U.S. State Department, on the one hand, tries its best to provoke the relationship between Asian countries and China, slandering the Chinese people as "not living in peace with their neighbors," and intimidating Asian countries that "have recently won independence and lack experience in governance" with the "serious danger" of being "overwhelmed by Chinese pressure"; on the other hand, it puts on a smiling face, trying to induce Asian countries to lose their vigilance, shamelessly boasting that "the U.S. policy towards Asia" "is to promote the domestic welfare of free countries and consolidate their independence." However, the U.S. State Department's excessive eagerness to achieve "policy goals" and its unscrupulous means resulted in a not-so-small loophole in the memorandum. If the U.S. policy towards Asia is really to promote the "consolidation of their independence" of Asian countries, rather than harboring aggressive purposes, then isn't it good that the Chinese people express their active support for the national independence movements of Asian, African, and Latin American countries? Doesn't it conform to the U.S. "policy goals"? Why does the United States oppose it? The U.S. State Department only cares about slandering others and pretending to be a good person, but its words are inconsistent and full of contradictions, exposing that it is completely deceiving people!

In fact, the "independence" supported by the United States is the kind of "independence" of the Lee Seung-man group in South Korea, the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, and the Ngo Dinh Diem group in South Vietnam. The U.S. policy towards Asia is to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, control these countries, and plunder these countries. On this point, Johnston, a special advisor to the U.S. President and one of the people involved in U.S. foreign policy decision-making, made a frank confession on January 23 this year. Johnston said that after World War II, a "new third world" emerged in Asia, Africa, and the Near East on the basis of the old colonial empires. The U.S. foreign policy is to fight for the seizure of this "third world," and "whether the United States can continue to survive will depend on the outcome of this struggle." His argument is: "The American capitalist system can only survive by expanding," because the United States must "rely on foreign raw materials" and "rely on foreign markets." Isn't this the policy that the United States has always implemented in Asia? Johnston's words are a commentary on the U.S. State Department's memorandum.

The memorandum ostensibly talks about the issue of not recognizing China, but in fact, it talks about the U.S. aggressive policy towards the entire Asia. It openly opposes the 600 million Chinese people, but it exposes the United States' sinister intentions towards the 1.3 billion Asian people. This once again proves that American imperialism is the common and vicious enemy of the Chinese people and the people of all Asian countries.

The United States chooses to talk about its policy towards Asia on the issue of China, which is not without reason. Like all Asian countries, China has long suffered from the oppression and plunder of Western colonialism and is still under the threat of aggression from American imperialism today. However, after the victory of the revolution, China is fully engaged in national economic construction, production is developing rapidly, and people's lives are improving. The great achievements of the Chinese people attract the attention of the whole world, especially among the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, and have had a profound impact. At the same time, the Chinese people's peaceful foreign policy and the Chinese people's firm stance of resolutely opposing imperialist aggression and defending peace have been widely understood by the people of all countries. They realize that the Chinese people are their most reliable friends in the struggle for national independence and against imperialist aggression, and the powerful existence of the Chinese people's strength encourages their courage and confidence in the struggle. Precisely because of this, China's international status and prestige are growing year by year. China has become the glorious banner for the people of all oppressed countries to fight for and defend national independence. This is obviously unfavorable to American imperialism, which harbors the ambition to dominate the world and carries out aggression, enslavement, and plunder of the people of all countries everywhere. The United States insists on being hostile to the Chinese people, ignoring the powerful existence of the 600 million Chinese people, maliciously slandering and vilifying the Chinese people in every possible way, and even shamelessly provoking the relationship between Asian countries and China, in order to undermine the Chinese people's prestige and influence internationally, especially in Asian national independent countries, so that it can freely interfere in the national independence movements of these countries and trample the people of these countries under its feet, as it has done in South Korea, the Philippines, and South Vietnam.

It must be admitted that the U.S. State Department's memorandum is a masterpiece of reversing black and white and speaking inconsistently. However, for American imperialism, what is sad is that the era when lies could cover up the facts has gone forever from China and Asia. This is because, first, China already exists powerfully and is advancing bravely along the bright road of building socialism. Whether the United States recognizes it or not cannot affect the progress of the Chinese people. China is one of the countries that advocate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and it lives in peace with all large and small neighbors, supports the national independence aspirations of all countries, and opposes imperialist aggression against all countries. Therefore, any slander and vilification of the Chinese people by the United States cannot damage China's international reputation. Second, the people of Asian countries, like those of African and Latin American countries, have generally awakened, and the national independence movement is booming and has already achieved significant victories, and will achieve even greater victories in the future. Third, the national independence aspirations of Asian countries are sympathized with and supported by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Fourth, the jackal face of American imperialism has been widely recognized by the vast majority of people in Asian countries. The people of Asian countries have widely united and supported each other, so that the political conspiracies and military provocations of American imperialism and all imperialism in Asia can only be completely defeated. In short, the political landscape of Asia has undergone profound changes, the national independence movement has become the trend of the times, and the era of imperialist rule in Asia is bound to perish. What can American imperialism expect from any frantic struggle in Asia other than to be crushed under the giant wheel of the Asian people in the end!

The U.S. State Department chose to suddenly publish such a frantic memorandum at this time, which does not indicate its strength, but is merely an act of whistling to embolden itself while walking alone through a graveyard at night. Although the memorandum reflects the U.S. ruling group's failure to give up its desire to invade China and its determination to be enemies with the Chinese people to the end, it mainly reflects the major difficulties that the U.S. aggressive policy towards China and Asia has encountered, the U.S. ruling group and the imperialist camp are full of contradictions, and the U.S. government is very isolated and unpopular. It reflects the U.S. government's deep unease and helplessness in the face of the growing strength of the Chinese people, the development of the Asian national independence movement, and the international situation in which the East wind prevails over the West wind, and is caught in great contradictions and distress.

    黑夜独行吹口哨
    ——读美国国务院关于不承认我国的备忘录扎记
  　杜波
    编者按　美国战争狂人最近在台湾海峡地区对中国人民进行着疯狂的战争挑衅。虽然中美会谈已经在华沙恢复，但是各种迹象表明美国一面谈判，一面却在台湾海峡地区继续加紧进行扩大侵略的军事部署。在这个时候重读一下美国国务院不久以前所发表的所谓关于不承认中国的备忘录，是大有好处的。观其行而察其言，就更清楚地看出，美国国务院的备忘录是美国对中国人民和整个亚洲各国人民发动大规模军事挑衅的先声。
    美国国务院关于不承认我国的备忘录，企图为美国敌视中国人民、侵略亚洲各国的政策辩解，但是并没有成功。这篇备忘录发表以后，美国政府遭到了世界各国爱好和平人民的猛烈抨击，甚至美国的盟国和美国国内的舆论也对它加以嘲笑。英国报纸认为，美国发表备忘录是“盲目到令人奇怪的地步”；美国报纸说，备忘录想为美国政府不得人心的政策辩解，但充满了不能使人信服的“腐朽的论据”！9月1日的美国“新共和”周刊甚至登载了一首诗，为美国这个无视中国现实的备忘录写照：“政治浸蚀烈，中国海底沉”；“昔日中国域，茫茫不可寻”！这实在是个绝大的讽刺！
    这篇由美国国务卿杜勒斯签署的冗长得使人生厌的备忘录，对亚洲和世界的局势极尽歪曲的能事，对伟大的中国人民和中国共产党进行种种荒谬的恶毒诬蔑，对亚洲国家和我国的关系作了反复的无耻挑拨。但它的基本内容，只要用两句话就可以全部加以概括，这就是：新中国并不存在，新中国“坏透了”！这种完全颠倒黑白、无视现实的奇谈怪论，看了真使人作呕！特别是出自在中国人民面前曾经碰得焦头烂额的美帝国主义之口，简直不知人间还有羞耻事！
    如果真像备忘录所说的，中国政府不过是空中楼阁，“并不代表中国人民真正的意志和愿望”，并且是“有朝一日总会消失的”没有生命力的东西，那末，美国侵略势力怎么会在1949年连同它花了六十多亿美元装备起来的蒋介石集团一起滚出了中国大陆呢？美国侵略势力在中国的活动，从1784年美国商船头一次到达中国的时候算起有一百七十四年，从1844年美国强迫中国签订第一个不平等条约的时候算起也有了一百一十四年，今天美国虽然依旧窃据着我国的领土台湾和澎湖列岛，不是绝大部分的赌本都输得精光了吗？中国人民同朝鲜人民一起，在朝鲜战场上也同美国侵略者较量过，结果怎样呢？备忘录说，美国在侵略朝鲜战争期间白白送掉了十四万二千美国人的生命（读者注意，杜勒斯在这里大大缩小了实际伤亡的数字），至今想起来还有“种种悲痛”，这难道不是说明美国在侵略朝鲜的战争中什么也没有捞到吗？并且，这些年来，美国一直逼迫它的同盟国家对中国“禁运”，非法剥夺中国人民在联合国的权利，天天对新中国进行咒骂和诬蔑，紧张得很，又是为什么呢？
    中国人民敢于反对和藐视美帝国主义，使它再不能骑在中国人民的脖子上拉尿拉屎，为所欲为了，这在美国老爷们看起来，就叫做“缺乏道德观念”，是不足为奇的。但是，整个长达八千余字的备忘录，从头到尾，诬蔑我国政府这也不是，那也不好，难道这不叫“缺乏道德观念”吗？究竟谁给了美国国务院干涉别人内政的权利呢？中国政府是好是坏，何劳远在太平洋那边的、相距十万八千里的美国国务院来判断！中国是中国人民的中国，中国政府是中国人民自己选择的政府，中国六亿人民都拥护自己的政府，美国国务院除了干瞪眼，根本奈何不得！中国人民在同美帝国主义的长期斗争中，已经摸到了一条看问题的方法：凡是美帝国主义叫好的，在中国人民看来一定坏；凡是美帝国主义说坏的，中国人民看来一定好。美国国务院的备忘录已经在中国的报纸上全文发表，它对中国政府和人民的种种诬蔑和咒骂，使中国人民又一次看清了美国侵略者的无耻面目，更加激起了他们同仇敌忾的斗争精神。美国国务院是什么也得不到的！
    备忘录颠来倒去说了那么一大篇，无非是要说明美国政府为什么不承认中国。但是，它把美国政府承认或者不承认中国的作用，说得太神乎其神了！据备忘录说，如果美国政府承认了中国，就会使中国“提高国际地位和威望”；如果不承认，就足以“加速”中国的“消失的过程”。这真像是神话“耶利哥的城墙”的故事，似乎只要美国政府使劲吹起“不承认”中国的号角，中国的万里城墙就会坍塌下来，这难道不是十足的痴人说梦！美国国务院似乎从来没有想过：中国人民根本就不稀罕美国的什么承认，没有美国的承认，中国人民过去九年里生活得很好，今后还会生活得更好，美国承不承认，绝不会损害中国人民一根毫毛。可是，签署备忘录的这个杜勒斯似乎是很健忘的，他在1957年6月间曾经说过：“如果我们（美国）认为，我们同（中国）现政权建立外交关系能够促进这种消逝，那末，我们就建立这种关系”。这明明是说，美国如果承认中国，同中国建立了外交关系，不仅不会使中国“提高国际地位和威望”，而且美国会利用这种外交关系，继续干涉中国内政，在中国搞颠复活动，正同美国在伊朗、印度尼西亚、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、古巴、阿根廷、委内瑞拉……等国曾经干过的或者正在干的那样。幸好，中国是强大的，致使杜勒斯自己也不敢相信同中国建立了外交关系，“能够促进这种消逝”，直到今天不敢承认中国。这样，对中国有什么不好呢？中国人民对于美国的所谓承认，从来没有抱什么幻想。
    但是，备忘录在为“不承认中国”这个不得人心的政策的辩解中，暴露了美国统治集团对所谓外交政策的某些基本考虑，却值得人们加以注意。备忘录率直地承认：“美国认为，外交承认是一种执行国家政策的工具”；美国不承认中国，既可以“加速”中国“消失的过程”，又可以使中国“更加难于成功地奉行它的外交政策”。对美国来说呢，不承认中国，“这就便于美国达到在远东（注意！不仅仅是说在中国）的政策目标”，而承认中国“就会严重地妨碍达到这些目标”。那末，美国要使中国的什么外交政策“更加难于成功地奉行”呢？美国自己想在远东达到什么“政策目标”呢？为什么承认了中国就会严重地妨碍美国在远东达到这些目标呢？
    全世界人民都晓得，中国人民从革命胜利的那一天起，就坚定不渝地奉行和平外交政策。我国同印度、缅甸共同倡导了和平共处五项原则，积极地参加了亚非会议和制订亚非会议十项原则的工作，并且始终信守这些原则。我国一直同各国和平友好相处，坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的民族独立运动，反对殖民主义，特别是坚决对美帝国主义在世界各地进行侵略、制造紧张局势、威胁和平的罪恶行为进行斗争，以保卫和平。美国敌视中国人民这个和平外交政策，力图使这个政策“难于成功地奉行”，是什么意思呢？难道不是说明美国对“远东的政策目标”正好同中国的相反，从而，赤裸裸地暴露了美国对亚洲国家的侵略野心吗？
    美国国务院在备忘录中，一方面竭力挑拨亚洲国家同中国的关系，诬蔑中国人民“并不是在同邻国和平相处”，恫吓亚洲“那些最近才赢得独立的国家在治理方面经验不足”，有被中国人民“压力压倒的严重危险”；一方面又强装笑脸，企图诱使亚洲国家丧失警惕，恬不知耻地吹嘘“美国对亚洲的政策”，“是为了促进自由国家的国内福利和巩固它们的独立”。可是，美国国务院过分急于达到“政策目标”而不择手段的结果，竟在备忘录中出现了一个不小的漏洞。如果美国对亚洲的政策，真是为了促进亚洲国家“巩固它们的独立”，而不是怀抱侵略的目的，那末，中国人民表示积极支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的民族独立运动不是很好吗？不是同美国的“政策目标”相符合吗？为什么美国要反对呢？美国国务院只顾诽谤别人，自装好人，却前言不对后语，矛盾百出，暴露了自己完全是在骗人！
    其实，美国所支持的“独立”，是南朝鲜李承晚集团、台湾蒋介石集团和南越吴庭艳集团的那种“独立”。美国对亚洲的政策，是要干涉亚洲国家的内政，控制这些国家，掠夺这些国家。对这一点，参与美国外交政策决策的人物之一、美国总统特别顾问约翰斯顿，今年1月23日作过坦白的供认。约翰斯顿说，在第二次世界大战之后，在亚洲、非洲、近东从古老的殖民帝国的基础上产生了一个“新的第三世界”。美国的外交政策，就是要为夺取这个“第三世界”而斗争，“美国能不能继续生存下去将取决于这种斗争的结局”。他的论据是：“美国资本主义制度只有扩张才能生存下来”，因为美国既要“依靠国外的原料”，又要“依靠外国的市场”。美国历来在亚洲执行的，不正是这个政策吗？约翰斯顿的话，正好是美国国务院备忘录的注解。
    备忘录表面上是谈关于不承认中国的问题，而实际上谈到了美国对整个亚洲的侵略政策。它公开敌视六亿中国人民，却暴露了美国对十三亿亚洲人民怀抱着险恶的意图。这再一次证明了美帝国主义是中国人民和亚洲各国人民共同的凶恶敌人。
    美国选择对中国的问题来谈弄它的对亚洲的政策，不是没有原因的。中国同所有亚洲国家一样，曾长期遭受西方殖民主义的压迫和掠夺，并且今天仍然受到美帝国主义的侵略威胁。然而，中国在革命胜利之后，全力进行国家经济建设，生产猛烈发展，人民生活改善。中国人民的伟大成就，吸引着全世界的注意力，特别是在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民中，产生了深刻的影响。同时，中国人民的和平外交政策，中国人民坚决反对帝国主义侵略、保卫和平的坚定立场，已经为各国人民所普遍了解。他们认识到中国人民是他们在争取民族独立、反对帝国主义侵略斗争中的最可靠的朋友，中国人民力量的强大存在，鼓舞着他们的斗争勇气和信心。正因为是这样，中国的国际地位和威望一年比一年增长。中国已经成为一切被压迫国家人民争取和保卫民族独立的光荣旗帜。这对于抱有独霸世界野心、到处进行侵略、奴役和掠夺各国人民的美帝国主义，显然是不利的。美国坚持敌视中国人民，无视六亿中国人民的强大存在，恶毒地对中国人民进行种种诽谤和诬蔑，甚至无耻地挑拨亚洲各国同中国的关系，就是企图破坏中国人民在国际上、特别是在亚洲民族独立国家中的威望和影响，以便于它放手地干涉这些国家的民族独立运动，把这些国家的人民踩在自己的脚底下，像它在南朝鲜、菲律宾、南越所作的那样。
    应该承认，美国国务院备忘录不失为一篇颠倒黑白、言不顾行的杰作。但是，对于美帝国主义来讲，可悲的是，谎言能够掩盖事实的时代，已经从中国和亚洲一去不复返了。这是因为，第一，中国已经强大存在，正沿着建设社会主义的光明大道勇猛前进，美国承认也罢，不承认也罢，都不能影响中国人民的进程。中国是倡导和平共处五项原则的国家之一，同一切大小邻国和平共处，支持各国的民族独立愿望，反对帝国主义对各国的侵略。因此，美国对中国人民的任何诬蔑和诽谤，都损害不了中国的国际声誉。第二，亚洲国家同非洲、拉丁美洲各国一样，人民已经普遍觉醒，民族独立运动正在蓬勃发展，并且已经取得重大的胜利，今后还要取得更大的胜利。第三，亚洲各国人民的民族独立愿望，得到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的同情和支持。第四，美帝国主义的豺狼面目，已经为亚洲各国广大人民所普遍认识。亚洲各国人民已经广泛地团结起来，互相支持；使美帝国主义和一切帝国主义在亚洲的政治阴谋和军事挑衅都只能遭到彻底失败。总之，亚洲的政治面貌已发生深刻的变化，民族独立运动已经成为时代的潮流，帝国主义统治亚洲的时代必然归于灭亡。美帝国主义在亚洲的任何疯狂挣扎，除了最后使它自己在亚洲人民的巨轮底下被压碎，还能指望什么呢！
    美国国务院选择现在这样的时候，忽然发表这样一个疯狂的备忘录，并不表示它的强大，只不过是像独身夜过坟场，吹口哨以壮胆的行径而已。备忘录虽然反映了美国统治集团对于侵略中国的失败心犹未甘，决心与中国人民为敌到底，但它主要的是反映了美国对中国和亚洲的侵略政策碰到了重大的困难，美国统治集团和帝国主义阵营内部矛盾重重，美国政府十分孤立和不得人心。反映了美国政府对于中国人民力量日益强大，对于亚洲民族独立运动的发展，对于东风压倒西风的国际形势，深感不安，而又无可奈何，陷于极大的矛盾和苦闷中。
