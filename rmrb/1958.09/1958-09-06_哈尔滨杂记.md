　　Three: The Growth Process of a Factory Literary Group

    During my time in Harbin, I happened to be present when the Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles convened a provincial conference on amateur worker-peasant creation, and also the second anniversary of the founding of the "Meng Ya" (Sprout) creation group at the First Tool Factory of Harbin. Although the number of participants in the amateur worker-peasant creation conference was not very large, they all had a certain amount of artistic practice. As far as Heilongjiang Province is concerned, the basic team of amateur worker-peasant writers already exists, and that is the hundred or so people who attended this creation conference; their works have reached a certain level, and some of them are very good. The "Northern" monthly magazine has done a lot of work in cultivating and improving amateur worker-peasant authors, and its achievements are remarkable. Heilongjiang Province has great literary and artistic potential, and it is now blooming everywhere, and will soon have greater harvests. As far as Harbin City is concerned, creation groups have been organized in various factories. The "Meng Ya" creation group of the First Tool Factory has, after two years of struggle, now become a green shade and borne fruit. The development process of "Meng Ya" is very educational and worth discussing in detail.

    When this creation group was established on June 16, 1956, there were only eight people, but some of the eight people had muddled ideas and held incorrect views on literary creation. Half a month later, four of them collapsed. However, the four who remained were able to persevere and develop, which was entirely due to the factory Party committee's deep concern and strong leadership. Material support, such as providing a room as the "Meng Ya" meeting place, and giving them paper to publish the "Meng Ya" wall newspaper, certainly played a role in consolidating and developing "Meng Ya," but it was the strong leadership of the Party committee that played a decisive role – and not only political and principled leadership, but also frequent, constant, and concrete guidance.

    When the "Meng Ya" group initially became detached from reality, the Party committee not only pointed out this problem, but also arranged a tour program for them; for example, in order to help the "Meng Ya" group members to criticize, through literature and art, the incorrect idea among workers of demanding more and higher living welfare, the Party committee organized the "Meng Ya" group to visit the countryside, guiding them to write some works reflecting the lives of farmers, using facts to educate the workers; compared with the farmers, the workers' lives today are several times higher, therefore, if they demand even higher, it is unreasonable and harmful to the unity of workers and peasants. After the problem of detachment from reality was corrected, "Meng Ya" also showed a lack of fighting spirit, and the Party committee corrected it in time. When the works on "Meng Ya" had more criticism and satire and too little praise and eulogy of advanced figures, the Party committee immediately instructed them: to reflect the mainstream of life, and to take the eulogy of new people and new things as the main task. The members of the "Meng Ya" group once had the idea of specializing in one field, that is, those who write poetry only write poetry, and those who write essays only write essays, intending to become "specialists" from then on; the Party committee corrected them in time, guiding them to first seek all-round development, and not to plan to specialize in one field from the beginning. The Party committee gave advance instructions on the content of each issue of the "Meng Ya" wall newspaper, so that it would cooperate with the central task at that time and place, and also gave specific instructions on the manuscripts for the wall newspaper.

    Several people in the second workshop of this factory ran a wall newspaper called "Tuohuang" (Land Reclamation). During the blooming period last year, "Tuohuang" released reactionary remarks. The leader of this group, called "Xiaofei," was of very bad character and had stolen official seals and things. They used various pen names to spread reactionary remarks. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the "Meng Ya" group launched a fierce struggle against these reactionaries, thoroughly exposing the reactionary nature of "Tuohuang" in front of the workers and crushing this reactionary organization. This incident trained the members of the "Meng Ya" group, and also educated the vast number of workers and the vast masses of literature and art lovers among the workers.

    The members of the "Meng Ya" group came from various workshops of the factory. These group members later developed literary and art groups in their own workshops, becoming branches; these branches also have their own publications (handwritten), such as "Xinzhu" (New Bamboo) and "Qingmiao" (Green Seedling). Now they have planned to expand the team so that every workshop in the factory has such branches.

      After the members of the "Meng Ya" group write their works, the group first discusses them collectively, and recommends the better ones for submission; among the more than seven hundred works published on "Meng Ya," about one hundred and several tens of them have been selected and published by provincial and municipal newspapers and periodicals, and more than ninety of them have been selected and published after February of this year. These works include poems and novels, some of which are very well written, such as Han Deliang's short stories.

    The development process of the "Meng Ya" group shows that the activities of the factory literary and art group: one, must be under the leadership of the Party committee, two, must be closely linked to reality, and must have fighting spirit, and fight against revisionist ideas without compromise. In this way, they can train themselves and develop healthily.

　　三、一个工厂文学小组的成长过程
    我在哈尔滨的时候，适逢黑龙江省文联召开了全省工农业余创作会议，又逢到哈尔滨市的第一工具厂的“萌芽”创作小组创办二周年纪念。参加工农业余创作会议的，人数虽然不很多，可全是有一定的艺术实践的。就黑龙江省而言，工农业余作家的基本队伍已经有了，这就是出席这次创作会议的百数十人；他们的作品已经达到一定的水平，其中有些很优秀。“北方”月刊在培养和提高工农业余作者方面，作了许多工作，成绩卓然。黑龙江省的文艺潜力很大，现在已经遍地开花，不久就会有更大的收获。就哈尔滨市而言，创作小组已在各工厂组织起来了。第一工具厂的创作小组“萌芽”经过了两年的奋斗，现在已经是绿叶成荫，结了果子。“萌芽”的发展过程，很有教育意义，值得详细地谈一谈。
    这个创作小组在1956年6月16日成立时，只有八个人，可是八个人中还有思想糊涂、对于文学创作抱着不正确观念的。半个月后，垮掉了四个。但是留下来的四个人却能坚持下去，并且得到发展，这就完全靠了厂党委的深切关心和坚强领导。物质方面的支持，例如给一间屋子作为“萌芽”的会址，给他们纸张等，让他们能出“萌芽”壁报，这些当然也对“萌芽”的巩固下来和得到发展，起了作用，然而起着决定性作用的，却是党委的坚强领导，——而且不仅是政治上、原则上的领导，还有经常的随时随地的具体指导。
    “萌芽”小组最初脱离实际，党委不但指出了这个毛病，而且为他们布置了参观节目；例如，为了帮助“萌芽”小组成员能够通过文艺来批评工人中间的要求更多更高的生活福利的不正确思想，党委就组织“萌芽”小组参观农村，指导他们写了些反映农民生活的作品，用事实来教育工人；和农民相比，工人们今天的生活已经高了几倍，因此，如果再要求更高，那就不合理，那就有害于工农的团结。脱离实际的毛病纠正以后，“萌芽”又表现过缺乏战斗性的毛病，党委又及时加以纠正。当“萌芽”上的作品，批评和讽刺多而表扬、歌颂先进人物太少的时候，党委又立刻指示他们：要反映生活主流，以歌颂新人新事作为主要的任务。“萌芽”小组的成员曾经有过专攻一门的思想，即写诗的专写诗，写小品的专写小品，打算从此成为“专”家；党委又及时纠正他们，指导他们应当先求全面发展，不应当一开头就打算专攻一门。党委对于每期“萌芽”壁报的内容都事先作了指示，使其配合当时当地的中心任务，对于壁报的稿件也给予具体的指示。
    这个厂的第二车间的几个人搞过一个名为“拓荒”的壁报。去年鸣放时期，“拓荒”放出了反动言论。这一伙的头子叫做“晓非”，品质很坏，曾偷刻公章，偷东西。他们用了各种笔名，散布反动言论。“萌芽”小组在党委领导之下，同这些反动分子展开了激烈的斗争，在工人面前彻底暴露了“拓荒”的反动本质，打垮了这个反动组织。这件事使得“萌芽”小组的成员受到锻炼，也教育了广大工人，和工人中间爱好文艺的广大群众。
    “萌芽”小组的成员来自该厂的各个车间。这些组员后来又在各人自己的车间里发展文艺小组，成为分支；这些分支也有各自的刊物（手写的），如“新竹”、“青苗”。现在他们已经计划把队伍扩大，使得全厂每个车间都有这样的分支。
      “萌芽”小组的成员们写出作品后，组内先集体讨论，推荐比较好的向外投稿；在“萌芽”上发表过的七百多篇作品中，经省市报刊选登的约有一百数十篇，今年2月后选登的就有九十多篇。这些作品，有诗歌，有小说，其中有一些写得很好，例如韩德良的短篇小说。
    “萌芽”小组的发展过程，说明了工厂文艺小组的活动：一，必须在党委领导之下，二，必须密切联系实际，必须有斗争性，毫不妥协地和修正主义思想作斗争。这样，才能锻炼自己，才能健康地发展。
