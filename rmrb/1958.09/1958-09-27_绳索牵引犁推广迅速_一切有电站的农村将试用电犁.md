Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The rope-drawn plow, an effective weapon for deep plowing, is being actively promoted in various provinces and regions, with some areas experiencing extremely rapid trial production and promotion.

Based on the spirit of the National Rope-Drawn Machine On-Site Conference, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee recently decided to change its original plan to promote 200,000 rope-drawn plows throughout the province to 1,000,000. After the Provincial Party Committee issued its first notice to vigorously promote rope-drawn plows, party committees in various localities rushed to make samples, formulate plans, and hold on-site meetings at a rapid pace, actively organizing promotion. Currently, the Changwei Special District has already manufactured 5,970 rope-drawn plows. Shouguang County, under the slogan "Work hard for ten days, make three thousand plows," has already rushed to produce 1,300 rope-drawn plows, becoming the vanguard of the province's rope-drawn plow promotion work. As of the 22nd, the province has manufactured more than 30,000 rope-drawn plows. After testing, they can generally plow to a depth of 1.3 to 1.5 chi (approximately 43 to 50 cm).

The focus of Zhejiang Province's agricultural tool reform movement has shifted to vigorously developing deep plowing tools. Currently, most areas of the province are trialing rope-drawn plows, and a few areas have already begun promotion.

For more than half a month, Jiaxing, Wenzhou, and other regions have successively organized cadres to visit Fengxian County, Jiangsu, to see the rope-drawn machine. After returning, they began trial production. Now, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Jinhua, and other regions have either already held or are holding on-site meetings, experimenting, demonstrating, and promoting simultaneously. Most counties in Jiaxing Special District are now vigorously promoting rope-drawn plows, and the entire special district plans to rapidly promote more than 150,000 plows.

Many people's communes in Shaanxi have formulated plans, proposing to ensure that rope-drawn plows are promoted to every production team and production group, widely using this tool to deeply plow the land. The Sanyuan County Party Committee held a meeting on the 21st to study manufacturing and promotion, deciding to promote rope-drawn machines to every team within three days and popularize them to every production group within seven days.

The agricultural departments of Sichuan Province have initially planned to achieve rope-drawn plows in every commune before October 7th, and to achieve deep plowing with rope-drawn plows in every team around October 20th, promoting a total of 200,000 plows. In this way, it can not only meet the current needs of deep plowing but also lay the foundation for more large-scale promotion in the future.

The entire province is adopting the approach of the province and special districts working simultaneously and progressing side by side. On the one hand, the province is concentrating on rushing to produce samples, sending people to various places to hold on-site meetings, conducting demonstrations, and imparting technology, and helping the special districts train a group of artisans. On the other hand, various special districts and counties are also simultaneously taking action to find ways to manufacture. The first batch of rope-drawn plows in the province started production in Chengdu on the 24th and will soon be shipped to various special districts.

The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee requires the entire province to universally promote the use of rope-drawn plows by the end of October, achieving one human or animal-powered rope-drawn plow for every fifty mu (approximately 3.3 hectares) of land.

Currently, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and relevant factories in Xining City are rushing to manufacture rope-drawn plows and distribute them to various counties, and then the counties and communes will quickly imitate and promote them. The commercial departments are actively coordinating and solving the wood, steel cable, and hemp rope materials needed for manufacturing rope-drawn plows.

This newspaper reports: (Reporter Li Yi) Electric plows suitable for deep plowing will be gradually promoted and trialed with the development of rural small-scale power stations.

The electric plow training class held by the Ministry of Agriculture concluded at the end of August, training more than 100 technical personnel for various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions who understand electric plow manufacturing, operation, and repair. Now, these technical personnel have returned to various places with electric plows and drawings, promoting trial use in all rural areas that already have power stations. Wuqing, Anci, Xinhe, and other counties in Hebei Province, which have a relatively large number of rural small-scale power stations, are massively promoting the manufacturing and use of electric plows. These counties will strive to use electric plows to deeply plow most or part of their cultivated land this year.

Now, the Ministry of Agriculture is again calling for continued research into the problem of electric traction operation for harrowing, sowing, cultivating, fertilizing, pest control, and harvesting. Successes should be promoted as they occur, striving to complete these experimental research and key demonstration tasks during the Second Five-Year Plan period, so as to realize agricultural electrification under the conditions of the rapid and universal development of rural power stations.

    绳索牵引犁推广迅速
    一切有电站的农村将试用电犁
    综合新华社消息  深耕的有效武器——绳索牵引犁正在各省区积极推广，有些地区试制推广工作极为迅速。
    中共山东省委依据全国绳索牵引机现场会议的精神，最近决定将原定在全省推广绳索牵引犁二十万部的计划改为一百万部。在省委第一次发出大力推广绳索牵引犁的通知以后，各地党委都以飞快的速度赶制样品、制订规划、召开现场会议，积极组织推广。现在昌潍专区已经制造出绳索牵引犁五千九百七十部。寿张县在“苦干十天，造犁三千”的口号下，已经赶制成绳索牵引犁一千三百部，成为全省绳索牵引犁推广工作的尖兵。截至22日止，全省已制造绳索牵引犁三万多部。经过试验，一般都能深耕一尺三寸到一尺半。
    浙江省农具改革运动的重点已经转向大搞深耕工具。目前全省大部分地区正在试制绳索牵引犁，少数地区已开始推广。
    半个多月来，嘉兴、温州等地区先后组织干部去江苏奉贤县参观绳索牵引机，回来后就开始试制工作。现在嘉兴、杭州、金华等地区都已经或正在召开现场会议，一面试验，一面表演，一面推广。嘉兴专区大部分县现在都在大搞绳索牵引犁，全专区准备迅速推广十五万多部。
    陕西很多地区的人民公社，都制订了计划，提出保证绳索牵引犁推广到每个生产队，各生产小队，广泛使用这种工具深翻土地。中共三原县县委在21日就召开了会议，研究制造推广，决定要在三天内每个队都推广绳索牵引机，七天以后，普及到各生产小队。
    四川省农业部门初步规划，全省要在10月7日以前达到社社有牵引犁，10月20日左右队队用牵引犁深耕，共计推广二十万部。这样，不但可以适应目前深翻地的需要，也为今后更大量地推广打下基础。
    全省正采取省和专区同时动手，齐头并进的做法，一方面由省集中赶制样品，派人带往各地召开现场会议，进行示范表演和传授技术，并帮助专区培养一批工匠；另一方面，各专区、县也同时动手设法制造。全省第一批绳索牵引犁24日开始在成都生产，即将运往各专区。
    中共青海省委要求全省在10月底普遍推广使用绳索牵引犁，达到每五十亩地有一部人力或畜力绳索牵引犁。
    目前青海省农林厅正和西宁市有关工厂突击制造绳索牵引犁分赠各县，然后再由各县、各社迅速仿制推广。制造绳索牵引犁所需木料钢索麻绳等材料，商业部门正积极调配解决。
    本报讯  记者黎益报道：适于深耕的电犁，即将随着农村小型电站的发展逐步推广试用。
    农业部举办的电犁训练班已经在8月底结束，为各省、市、自治区训练了一百多个懂得电犁制造、操作和修理的技术人材。现在这批技术人员已经带着电犁、图纸返回各地，在一切已有电站的农村推广试用。河北省农村小型电站发展较多的武清、安次、新海等县，正在大量推广制造和使用电犁。这些县的大部或部分耕地要争取今年就用电犁来深耕。
    现在农业部又号召继续研究耙地、播种、中耕、施肥、治虫和收获的电力牵引操作的问题，成功一件推广一件，争取在第二个五年计划时期完成这些试验研究工作和重点示范工作，以便在农村电站迅速普遍发展的条件下实现农业电气化。
