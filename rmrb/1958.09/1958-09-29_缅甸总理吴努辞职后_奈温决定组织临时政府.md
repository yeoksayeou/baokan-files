Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, September 28th: Burmese Defense Forces Chief of Staff Ne Win stated on the evening of the 27th that he had agreed to Prime Minister U Nu's request and decided to form a provisional government.

In a radio address to the armed forces, Ne Win said that Burma was in a state of serious chaos, making free and fair elections impossible. He stated that he had decided to form a provisional government in order to ensure that free and fair elections could be held.

Ne Win also said that the government he intends to form will not serve the interests of any political party and will not be immersed in politics. He asked the army not to interfere in politics and to perform their proper duties in accordance with strict discipline.

Prior to this, in his reply to U Nu on the 26th, Ne Win stated that his government would not include any representatives of the major political organizations of Burma, except for suitable representatives from the states and the Chin Special Division.

After U Nu and Ne Win exchanged letters on the 26th, Burmese President U Win Maung summoned the Burmese Chamber of Deputies on the 27th to hold a meeting on October 28th, and the Chamber of Nationalities to hold a meeting on November 3rd, in order to transfer power to the army. U Nu will resign on October 28th.

Reports say that on the 27th, fully armed troops controlled Yangon and the main highways throughout Burma. On the evening of the 26th, Burmese troops set up control posts on the highways leading to Yangon and began collecting civilian weapons.

A United Nations dispatch said that Burmese Permanent Representative to the United Nations U Thant told reporters on the 27th that the transfer of power in his country does not mean that there will be any change in the attitude or personnel of his delegation.

    缅甸总理吴努辞职后
    奈温决定组织临时政府
    据新华社仰光28日电  缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温在27日晚上说，他已经答应吴努总理的要求，决定组织一个临时政府。
    奈温在对武装部队发表的广播演讲中说，缅甸处在严重的混乱状态中，因而无法进行自由而公正的选举。他表示他决定组织临时政府，是为了使自由而公正的选举得以举行。
    奈温还说，他打算组织的政府将不为任何政党的利益服务，也将不沉缅于政治中。他要求军队不要过问政治，要求他们根据严格的纪律执行他们正当的职责。
    在这之前，奈温在26日给吴努的复信中曾经表示，他的政府除了吸收各邦和钦族特别区的合适的代表参加以外，将不包括缅甸主要政党的各政治组织的任何代表。
    在吴努和奈温26日交换信件以后，缅甸总统吴温貌27日召请缅甸国会代表院在10月28日举行会议，民族院在11月3日举行会议，以便把政权移交给陆军。吴努将于10月28日辞职。
    有消息说，在27日这一天，全副武装的军队控制了仰光和全缅甸的主要公路。26日晚上，缅甸军队在通往仰光的公路上设置了控制据点，并且开始收集民间的武器。
    来自联合国的消息说，缅甸驻联合国常任代表吴丹在27日对记者说，他的国家的政权转移并不意味着他的代表团的态度或人员会有任何改变。
