Xinhua News Agency, London, 16th – British Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell today reiterated his views on the situation in the Taiwan Strait, arguing that China has the right to recover its coastal islands, and that US military intervention in China's recovery of its coastal islands is neither justified nor necessary, and that the British government's ambiguous attitude on this issue is dangerous. He also refuted some of the arguments made by US President Eisenhower in his recent televised broadcast.

Gaitskell made these remarks while speaking at a luncheon of the Foreign Press Association in London. He first stated that he disagreed with Macmillan's statement that "the current issue is not the present or future status of the coastal islands, but whether disputes of this nature should be resolved by force." Gaitskell said: Of course, we all hope to see such disputes resolved peacefully, but unfortunately, you cannot truly separate the issue of force from the issue of the status of the coastal islands. Moreover, it is not only one side using force.

Gaitskell said, "If you say this issue should not be resolved by force, then you must resolve it by some other means, and then you are faced with the question: which side is right. Therefore, we cannot avoid the issue of the status and future of these islands."

Gaitskell pointed out that former British Prime Minister Eden said in 1955 that Britain has always considered the coastal islands to be part of China, which can only mean that Eden believed that the Chinese government's demand to liberate the coastal islands was legitimate. Gaitskell said that the Labour Party also holds this view.

"If the Americans were willing to admit this and force the Chinese Nationalists to withdraw, then there would certainly be no danger of using force. We believe that the British government has a duty to try to persuade the US government to do so."

Gaitskell then criticized the British government's attitude in the Taiwan Strait region. He said that now, "no one knows what attitude the government is taking on this issue. No one can really say whether our troops will participate. No one can say whether the government has tacitly approved of US intentions, or is preventing it from going to war." He said, "This completely ambiguous attitude is dangerous for the Atlantic Alliance," "In addition to the threat to peace, the Quemoy (Kinmen) situation has also created a large gap between US official policy and British and Western European public opinion, and I don't think it does any good to try to cover up this fact."

Gaitskell defended himself by saying: I have always been, and still am, a strong supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Atlantic Alliance, and no sane person would call me a neutralist, appeaser, or anti-American. Then, he attacked some of the views expressed by Eisenhower in his recent television broadcast. Gaitskell expressed disagreement with Eisenhower's claim that if the United States came out to arm and "defend" Quemoy, it would not only be for Quemoy itself. Gaitskell said, "Absolutely no one really believes that withdrawing from islands that are only a few miles from the Chinese coast could have any military significance in relation to the defense of Formosa (Taiwan), which is eighty to one hundred miles away." He also said that he did not think that the "Munich incident" could be used to compare with the current situation in the Far East. He said that in Munich, the independence and integrity of a free and democratic country were ceded by agreement to a dictator who had no legitimate basis for any rights over Czechoslovakia. The Beijing (China) government's basis of rights to the coastal islands is "a completely different matter," "they must be regarded as part of the mainland, and not part of another independent country." He said that withdrawing from Quemoy would undoubtedly shatter Chiang Kai-shek's dream of restoring power on the Chinese mainland, "but isn't that a good thing?" He also said, I think that if this island had been withdrawn in the past three years, it would have strengthened rather than weakened the prestige of the United States, especially in Asia. Now there is no doubt that after the recent announcement by the US government of the importance of these islands, some people worry that withdrawal would cause the United States to lose face, but how can we seriously compare this with the terrible danger of a war between the United States and China that may involve the use of nuclear weapons?

Gaitskell finally spoke about the Labour Party's four-point plan for the Far East situation, the first point of which is: the government of the People's Republic of China "should now be recognized as the government of China, and should obtain its legitimate seat in the United Nations." However, the remaining points of this plan disregard the just demands of the Chinese people for their own territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands (Pescadores), and advocate placing these places "under United Nations administration" first, and then allowing the residents of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to "make their own decisions, either to be independent or to join China." Obviously, Gaitskell's proposal is contrary to the interests of the Chinese people and the sacred principle of safeguarding China's territorial sovereignty and integrity.

### 盖茨克尔驳斥艾森豪威尔荒谬论点  要英国政府不要追随美国玩火  但又无视我国主权主张台湾由联合国管理

    盖茨克尔驳斥艾森豪威尔荒谬论点
    要英国政府不要追随美国玩火
    但又无视我国主权主张台湾由联合国管理
    新华社伦敦16日电　英国工党领袖盖茨克尔今天重申了他对台湾海峡局势问题的观点，他认为中国有权收复沿海岛屿，美国以武力干涉中国收复沿海岛屿既不是正当的，也不是必要的，英国政府在这一问题上采取暧昧态度是危险的。他还驳斥了美国总统艾森豪威尔最近在电视广播演说中所发表的一些论点。
    盖茨克尔是在伦敦外国记者协会的午宴会上发言时说这番话的。他首先表示他不同意麦克米伦的这种说法：“目前的问题不是沿海岛屿的现在或将来的地位问题，而是这种性质的争执是否应当用武力来解决的问题。”盖茨克尔说：当然我们大家希望看到这种争执得到和平解决，但是很不幸，你不能真正把武力问题同沿海岛屿的地位问题分开。而且，并不是只有一方面在使用武力。
    盖茨克尔说，“如果你说这个问题不应该用武力来解决，你就必须用其他某种办法来解决，于是你就碰到这样一个问题：哪一方面是对的。因此我们不能避开这些岛屿的地位和未来的问题。”
    盖茨克尔指出，前英国首相艾登在1955年说过，英国一向认为沿海岛屿是中国的一部分，这只能意味着艾登认为中国政府关于解放沿海岛屿的要求是合法的。盖茨克尔说，工党也抱有这种见解。
    “如果美国人愿意承认这一点，并且迫使中国国民党人撤出，那么就肯定不会有任何使用武力的危险。我们认为英国政府有任务设法说服美国政府这样做。”
    盖茨克尔接着批评英国政府在台湾海峡地区所采取的态度。他说，现在，“谁也不知道政府在这个问题上采取什么态度。谁也不能实在地说我们的军队是否会参加进去。谁也说不上政府是已经默许了美国的意图呢，还是在制止它走向战争。”他说，“这种完全暧昧的态度对于大西洋联盟是危险的”，“除了对和平的威胁以外，金门局势也已经使美国官方政策同英国和西欧的舆论之间有了一个很大的鸿沟，我认为企图掩饰这个事实是没有任何好处的。”
    盖茨克尔为自己表白说：我一向是、而且现在仍然是北大西洋公约组织和大西洋联盟的有力拥护者，任何头脑清醒的人都不会称我是中立主义者、姑息者或反美派。接着，他又抨击了艾森豪威尔在他最近的一次电视广播演说中表明的一些观点。盖茨克尔表示不同意艾森豪威尔所谓如果美国出来武装“保卫”金门那不仅是为了金门一地的说法。盖茨克尔说，“绝对没有人真的相信，撤出离中国海岸只有几英里的一些岛屿，可能在军事意义上同八十到一百英里以外的福摩萨（台湾）的防务有什么关系”。他又说，他并不认为可以应用“慕尼黑事件”来比喻目前远东的局势。他说，在慕尼黑，一个自由和民主的国家的独立和完整凭一纸协定拱让给了对捷克斯洛伐克没有任何正当的权利根据的独裁者。而北京（中国）政府对沿海岛屿的权利根据是“完全不同的一回事”，“必须把它们当作大陆的一部分，而不是另一个独立的国家的一部分”。他说，撤出金门无疑会使蒋介石在中国大陆复辟的梦想破灭，“但是难道这是件不好的事情吗？”他还说，我认为，如果在过去三年中撤出这个岛屿的话，这本会加强而不会是削弱美国的威望，特别是在亚洲的威望。现在毫无疑问，在美国政府最近宣布这些岛屿的重要性以后，有人担心撤退会丢美国的面子，但是我们怎么能够认真地把这同美国和中国发生可能使用核武器的战争的可怕危险相提并论呢？
    盖茨克尔最后谈到工党关于远东局势的四点计划，其中第一点是：中华人民共和国政府“现在应该被承认为中国的政府，并且应该在联合国取得它的合法席位”。但是这个计划的其余几点却无视中国人民对自己领土台湾和澎湖列岛的正义要求，而主张把这些地方先“置于联合国管理之下”，然后由台湾和澎湖列岛上的居民“作出他们自己的决定，或者是独立，或者是加入中国”。显然，盖茨克尔的这个主张是同中国人民的利益和维护中国领土主权完整的神圣原则相违背的。
