    Red Army Veteran Trains Militia
    By Sun Yuchang, Xinhua News Agency Reporter

The shameless provocations of American imperialism have enraged Fang Homing, a battle-hardened Red Army veteran and former regimental commander who had returned to civilian life. He has taken up arms again and is intensifying the training of the young men of his hometown – the militia of the “August 1st” Cooperative in Liulin Township, Hong'an County, Hubei Province, an old revolutionary base area. This news has quickly spread, earning praise from far and wide, with people saying, "The old general is back in action!"

Fang Homing commanded troops in the Red Army, fighting in the south and north, experiencing the arduous years of climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands, and making many contributions to the Party and the people. After retirement, he worked diligently in his hometown like an ordinary farmer, never boasting of his merits. Why is he now back on the training ground? The story is this: the militia organization of the "August 1st" Cooperative was established early, with more than thirty young people. They actively worked on production and stood guard, but their military skills were not very proficient. When news came of the American imperialists' military provocations in China's coastal areas, the young men were filled with righteous indignation, eager to arm themselves and asked Fang Homing to be their commander. They assured Fang Homing that, in order to defend their homeland, they would learn military skills well and be ready to be called upon at any time to strike the invaders.

As soon as the old regimental commander took office, he rushed to the county military service bureau to collect a batch of guns and ammunition. When distributing the weapons, Fang Homing said, "From now on, everyone is not only a farmer but also a soldier. The duty of a revolutionary soldier is to obey the organization and follow orders." He asked everyone if they could do it. The young men, armed with guns and full of vigor, replied in unison: "We certainly can!" The young men immediately started a collective stove and began a militarized life of shared labor and shared military training.

Although the old regimental commander is weak and often ill, his responsible spirit is as strong as ever. Every day before dawn, he gets up and goes to the training ground to count the number of people, teach the militia how to march, sing military songs, and correct movements. He is very patient in his training. In order to help everyone learn difficult movements, he sometimes explains them to everyone over and over again and demonstrates them until they learn. After a day of productive labor, some people become rusty with the movements they learned in the morning. Fang Homing told them about his experience in militia training before joining the Red Army: Practice whenever you have time, and take advantage of every opportunity to review. Going to work, coming home from work, field breaks, before and after meals are all good opportunities to review military movements. After implementing this method, they mastered basic movements such as turns, sitting, standing, and prone shooting in a few days, and now they have begun to learn tactical movements such as squad attack and squad defense.

This former Red Army regimental commander, rich in combat experience, skillfully combines labor and military training. He uses the militia's degree of obedience to labor commands to measure their degree of obedience to military commands, and uses the method of commanding troops to command militia labor, cultivating the militia's habit of collective action. He assigns the most arduous production tasks in the cooperative to the militia team. Once, the cooperative assigned the militia the task of producing a large amount of charcoal needed for steelmaking. Fang Homing commanded the team, carrying weapons, tools, luggage, and rice bags, and marched to the deep mountains and old forests seventy miles away. At night, they lived in a dilapidated shed, and the rain leaked in, wetting everything inside. At this time, everyone huddled together in a small, relatively dry place, some dozing, some talking and laughing. Only militia member Wang Qishan was a little afraid of hardship, and he said: "We are really experiencing hardship this time!" The other militiamen immediately said that compared with the situation of Commander Fang climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands, our suffering is nothing. Three days later, they "returned to the defense." When passing by their respective homes, the militiamen consciously observed discipline, and none of them left the team, all passing by without entering. Seeing this situation, the old regimental commander praised everyone for their rapid progress, worthy of being the descendants of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.

The old regimental commander's strong fighting spirit, which never fades, deeply moved all the militiamen. Everyone took the old regimental commander as an example and intensified their study of military skills. Wu Xuewen, a demobilized soldier, came to the "August 1st" Cooperative from faraway Guangzhou specifically to learn from the old regimental commander. Now he has become the old regimental commander's assistant.

As the reporter left this mountain village, the old hero told me with full confidence that in a very short period of time, he would train this small militia team into sharpshooters who could hit the target every time. Once the motherland calls, they will immediately go to the front line to eliminate the enemy. From now on, everyone is not only a farmer but also a soldier...

    红军老团长训练子弟兵
    新华社记者　孙玉昌
  美帝国主义的无耻挑衅，激怒了身经百战、解甲归田的红军老团长方和明，他又重新拿起枪杆，加紧教练家乡的子弟兵——老苏区湖北省红安县柳林乡“八一”社的基干民兵。这件事很快地传开，远近称颂，都说他是“老将出马！”
    方和明在红军时代曾指挥部队南征北战，经历过爬雪山过草地那样艰难的岁月，为党为人民立了许多功劳。退休后，他在家乡像一个普通农民一样勤勤恳恳地从事劳动生产，从不居功骄傲。为什么他现在又在练兵场上出现了呢？事情是这样的：“八一”社的民兵组织建立较早，一共有三十多个青年，他们积极地突击生产，站岗放哨，但是军事技术还不很熟练。当美帝国主义在我国沿海地区进行军事挑衅的消息传来后，青年们个个义愤填胸，磨拳擦掌，纷纷要求武装起来，并请方和明给他们当指挥官。他们向方和明提出保证：为了保家卫国，一定练好武艺，准备随时应召打击侵略者。
    老团长一上任，就赶到县兵役局领来了一批枪支弹药。在分发武器时，方和明说，从现在起，大家不仅是农民，而且是军人，革命军人的天职是服从组织听从调动。他问大家能不能做到？荷枪实弹、精神抖擞的青年们异口同声地答道：“一定作得到！”青年们立即动手打起了集体炉灶，过起了共同劳动、共同练武的军事化生活。
    老团长虽然体弱多病，但认真负责的精神不减当年。每天天还不亮，他就起床来到练武场，查点人数，教民兵走步，唱军歌，校正动作。他在教练中很耐心。为了使大家学会难作的动作，他有时一遍又一遍地说给大家听，作给大家看，直到教会为止。经过一天的生产劳动，有些人对早晨学的动作又生疏了。方和明就把他在参加红军前参加民兵训练的经验告诉大家：有空就练，利用一切机会复习，上工收工、田间休息、饭前饭后，都是复习军事动作的好机会。实行这办法后，他们就在几天时间内把转法、坐、立、卧射等基本动作练得烂熟，现在已经开始学习班进攻、班防御等战术动作了。
    这位富有战斗经验的前红军团长，把劳动和练武结合得很巧妙。他用民兵队伍对劳动指挥的服从程度来测定他们对军事指挥的服从程度，用指挥军队的方法来指挥民兵劳动，培养民兵集体行动的习惯。他把社里最艰巨的生产任务都交给民兵队去执行。有一次，社里把办钢铁需要大量木炭的任务交给了民兵。方和明指挥队伍，背起武器、工具、行李和米袋，向七十里以外的深山老林进军。晚间住在一栋倾斜欲倒的棚子里，外面下着暴雨，屋里全被漏进来的雨水淋湿了。这时大家挤在一小块比较干燥的地方，有的坐着打盹，有的谈笑，只有民兵王其善有点怕苦，他说：“我们这次可尝到艰苦的滋味啦！”其他民兵马上说，这和方团长爬雪山过草地的情形比较，我们这点苦简直不算什么。三天过后“返防”了，在路过各自家门口的时候，民兵们自觉的遵守纪律，没有一个离队的，都是过其门而不入。看到这情形，老团长夸奖大家进步很快，不愧为工农红军的后代。
    老团长这种永不褪色的顽强的战斗精神，深深感动了所有的民兵，大家都以老团长为榜样，加紧学习军事本领。有一位复员军人吴学文，为了要学习老团长的榜样，专门从遥远的广州来到“八一”社安家落户。现在已成为老团长的助手。
    在记者离开这个山村的时候，这位老英雄信心百倍地告诉我，在很短的时间里，他将把这支小小的民兵队伍全部训练成为百发百中的神枪手，一旦祖国召唤，就马上开赴前线，消灭敌人。从现在起，大家不仅是农民，而且是军人了……
