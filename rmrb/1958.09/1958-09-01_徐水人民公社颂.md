　　Ode to the Xushui People's Commune
　　By Our Correspondent Kang Zhuo

　　6. High-Yield Satellites About to be Launched

　　Perhaps I have described Xie Fang Village a bit exaggeratedly, but in fact, many cultural villages have emerged in Xushui. Dasi Gezhuang and Nan Zhangfeng are also flourishing in civilization, and Da Wangdian has started art training classes. The lion dance of Beili Village has traveled all over Europe, and the performance of Qianminzhuang Suona Association has spread throughout the country through radio stations. Shi Duan's dance, the Liudongying theater troupe and creative group, and the philosophical studies of the Cui Zhuang farmers are all sailing upstream in the ocean of culture. However, the most important symbol of the people's commune and communism still lies in the high yield of grain; and judging from the growth of crops, Xie Fang Village, despite its blooming flowers, is still slightly inferior to Dasi Gezhuang and other places.

　　Xushui has more than 200 reservoirs and more than 2,000 mechanized wells, and 1,000 power pumps, which have realized mechanized irrigation. It has more than 20 tractors, completed the bearingization, and is completing the semi-mechanization of agricultural tool reform. Under such circumstances, the yam fields near the JuBaoPen Reservoir in Da Wangdian, supplied by a portable boiler engine, have already produced twelve catties of fruit on one seedling, which is naturally a growing satellite. The satellite yams of Dasi Gezhuang are even more diverse. One type of manure pile shaped yam that Chairman Mao saw uses manure and soil to build piles, planting seedlings on the piles, which not only improves land utilization but also provides rich fertility. There are also yams that Chairman Mao saw planted in four rows, eight rows, and twelve rows respectively on a ridge, developing the past cultivation method of two thousand seedlings per mu to fifteen thousand seedlings per mu here, with planned yields ranging from 200,000 catties to 1,000,000 catties per mu. Dasi Gezhuang also has diversified biogas yams. Manure is piled up, sealed with soil on the outside, and yams are planted on the soil; a bamboo tube is inserted into the top of the pile, directly into the manure pile, and water is poured down the bamboo tube to promote fertilizer fermentation and release biogas, thus nourishing the soil and crops. Or, manure is piled up into a long, symmetrical hillside, and the soil is built into terraces along the hillside, planting yams on each terrace. Or, manure is piled into a cone-shaped pagoda, and the soil is built into circular terraces along the pagoda slope, planting yams on each terrace. The tops of the latter two types of biogas piles are also inserted with bamboo tubes for watering. In addition, the diversified biogas piles of Dasi Gezhuang have now been developed to grow Xushui's famous Chinese cabbage or radishes. All these satellite crops, whether utilizing biogas or not, are not only heavily fertilized and watered diligently, but also applied with potash fertilizer, sprayed with phosphate fertilizer, and sprinkled with growth hormones. The million-catty-per-mu yams of Dasi Gezhuang are even watered with dog meat soup.

　　1.2 Million Catties of Yams per Mu

　　Biogas crops and using dog meat soup to fertilize the fields are not unique to Dasi Gezhuang. Caozhuang of the Caohe People's Commune has a 2.6-mu biogas experimental field, which is even more colorful. It is the field laboratory of the scientific research group led by Liu Tingkui, the former first secretary of the local township party committee. The group members include township technician Cao Qinghai, village branch secretary Wei Keming, former village agricultural cooperative director Wei Wenlin, and several other commune members. In that rectangular piece of land, the middle of the northernmost part is a two-fen tower-shaped biogas yam pile, with fifteen circular terraces, equivalent to four fen of flat land, planted with 50,000 seedlings. On the west side are six small piles, three of which are biogas yams, covering a total area of one fen, planted with 3,500, 1,700, and 1,500 seedlings respectively; the other three piles are yams without biogas. These piles are all the same size, and different measures are taken to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the presence or absence of biogas and sparse or dense planting. In the south, there is also a one-mu arched biogas yam field, with a layer of horse manure averaging two chi thick at the bottom, followed by manure soil, and then a layer of good soil; this three-dimensional structure is equivalent to 1.3 mu of flat land, planted with 750,000 seedlings. In addition, there are some flat biogas yams in the scattered open spaces on both sides, and 1.6 mu of yams with trellises for the seedlings. That one-mu arched yam field is planned to produce 1.2 million catties. As long as each seedling grows a catty and a half of yams, the 750,000 seedlings can guarantee this satellite number. Judging from the current production situation, it should be said that there is no problem for this satellite to ascend to the sky, because a yield of one or two catties of yams per seedling is originally a low yield not worth mentioning. The 50,000 seedlings on the two-fen tower pile, judging from the current situation, can also become a satellite with a yield of one million catties per mu. The 1.6-mu yam with trellises, irrigated with the meat soup of four dogs, has also grown into a robust satellite shape, and it seems that it will also soar into the clouds.

　　500 Catties of Chinese Cabbage per Plant

　　At the southern end and on both sides of this biogas experimental field, there are also Chinese cabbage and radishes planted in the shape of millstones, round tiles, and four or six rows on each ridge. In terms of Chinese cabbage satellites, Dasi Gezhuang has one fen of land stacked with forty square three-dimensional structures, each structure covering an area of two square chi, and each structure is required to grow a 500-catty Chinese cabbage; the Caozhuang experimental field also plans to cultivate Chinese cabbage with a yield of 500 catties per plant on the flat ground. In the central open space of the Caozhuang experimental field, there is also a piece of experimental crops arranged in the shape of the characters "satellite" using large clay pots and large flower pots. The pots and basins are planted with four different kinds of radishes and many Chinese cabbages; one large flower pot has a transplanted multi-spike corn plant, which was given 5 cc of glucose; another pot has a yam plant, with thirteen main seedlings divided into twenty-six plants by pressing the vines, totaling twenty-seven places growing yams; this yam was injected with 20 cc of glucose and is required to yield 100 catties per plant. This entire experimental field was originally a desolate graveyard, but now, people from the suburbs of Baoding come to visit every day, saying they are visiting a garden.

　　120,000 Catties of Wheat per Mu

　　Caozhuang, like Dasi Gezhuang and Xie Fang, is an electrified village. The biogas experimental field also has electric lighting equipment, and there is a brightly lit experimental shed and dormitory shed for the scientific research group at night. A water tower is also being built next to the experimental field, preparing to provide artificial rainfall for this area in the future. Now, a mu of land has also been turned over next to the experimental field to prepare for planting winter wheat. Since I had discussed high-yield wheat with Liu Tingkui a long time ago, he also smiled mysteriously and asked me beside that mu of land:

　　"Guess how many ten thousand catties this mu of wheat will yield?"

　　"Eighty thousand?" I asked back. This is the highest number I have ever heard.

　　"Hehe," Liu Tingkui covered his lips with his palm and said quietly, "Let me be honest with you! This is going to yield 120,000 catties!"

　　Wanting to yield 120,000 catties of wheat per mu! I really don't believe anyone in the world has ever heard of such a thing. I asked Liu Tingkui about the measures, and he told me that they are now letting the midsummer sun shine on the turned soil, then digging seven chi deep, turning the underground red soil layer up and mixing it with good soil; applying 300,000 catties of base fertilizer; artificially cultivating the seeds first, and sowing them as soon as they sprout to prevent the large amount of fertilizer from burning the sprouts; stacking the land into piles and using biogas to nourish it; irrigating with artificial rainfall, and supplementing with the most and best chemical fertilizers in batches; sowing 1,000 catties of seeds, one seed per square centimeter; if each plant grows eighty grains of wheat, that would be a yield of 120,000 catties per mu.

　　What lofty ambition! What magnificent spirit! Liu Tingkui is also cultivating multi-colored cotton and new yam varieties, and saving money in his personal life to buy a camera; he wants to use photos to record the process of scientific experiments, use photos to commend advanced individuals, and promote work. He has a sky-breaking optimism and vigor, and never relaxes in learning from others. Using dog meat soup on the land was inspired by Gao Yusheng, the first secretary of the Datian People's Commune Party Committee. He and Gao Yusheng, as well as Shi Yifa, the current first secretary of the Caohe People's Commune Party Committee, are long-term rivals in competition and good comrades who learn from each other. Shi Yifa has created a large area of multi-spike corn satellites in Nanting Village, with each plant nearly ten chi tall and bearing nine or ten ears. Liu Tingkui has also created eighty mu of high-yield multi-spike corn and multi-spike sorghum. These satellite crops are also extremely lush in Dasi Gezhuang and Xie Fang. They and Dasi Gezhuang have also created satellite millet with 400,000 plants per mu, now more than one meter tall, with stalks as thick as wooden sticks and ears five cun long, which can at least reach a yield of 20,000 catties per mu.

　　5,000 Catties of Cotton per Mu

　　Finally, we should return to Dasi Gezhuang, back to the seven mu of cotton fields there. The three cotton branches that Chairman Mao saw there are all tied with red cloth. With 4,000 plants per mu, averaging six chi tall, everyone who sees them says they are cotton trees. Each plant averages twenty-five fruiting branches, forty cotton bolls, and forty-five flower buds; the most cotton bolls on one plant have reached one hundred and ten, and the current situation can yield nearly 2,000 catties of lint per mu. But people still want the cotton plants to grow to eight chi tall and have each plant grow one hundred and twenty cotton bolls to ensure a yield of 5,000 catties of lint per mu. The cultivation of these seven mu of land includes sparse and dense planting comparisons and early and late planting comparisons. There are also pieces with sheds built, covered with bed sheets on the shed roof at night, and illuminated and stimulated with electric lights under the shed. This area was applied with 54,000 catties of base fertilizer per mu and 120 catties of superphosphate; ammonium sulfate was applied four times, totaling 170 catties; nitrogen fertilizer was applied once, and growth hormones and potassium salts were applied four times each. Phosphorus was sprayed four times, and insects were removed seven times; it was hoed eight times, watered twice, and pruned eighteen times. Responsible comrades from the central and provincial levels have repeatedly said that this cotton should be made into a movie as soon as possible. As many people have said, this cotton will, like many frightening high-yield wonders that will appear in agriculture this autumn, shock lakes, seas, mountains, and rivers like a satellite.

　　2,000 Catties of Grain per Mu in the Whole County

　　All these high-yield satellites that are about to be launched, connected with Xushui's large-area high-yield fields, will increase the grain yield per mu here from 214 catties last year to 2,000 catties this year. The establishment of the people's commune and Chairman Mao's inspection are the forces that are currently striving for 2,000 catties, enough to make mountains fall and seas calm. These satellite crops that are about to be launched are bright and dazzling red flags fluttering in the sky above the people's commune hall that is moving towards communism; and only the people's commune can raise such red flags. Just think, a two-fen biogas yam pile would cost hundreds of man-days, and the cost is even incalculable; except for a people's commune with tens of thousands of people, which ordinary agricultural cooperative could afford to do it!

　　The superiority of the people's commune cannot be sung enough, and the brilliant future of the people's commune cannot be praised enough. The people's commune of Xushui will, in the near future, lead the members to the highest fairyland in human history, which is the time of the free kingdom of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

　　六、将要发射的高产卫星
    也许我把谢坊村描写得有点儿夸张，其实徐水的文化村已经出现了不少。大寺各庄和南张丰也是文明兴盛，大王店办起了艺术训练班。北里村的狮子舞走遍了欧洲，迁民庄吹歌会的演奏通过广播电台传遍了全国。史端的舞蹈，留东营的剧团和创作组，以及崔庄农民的哲学学习，同样都航行在文化海洋的上游。但是，人民公社和共产主义的最重要的标志，还在于粮食的高产；而从庄稼生长情况来看，谢坊村尽管也是百花齐放，却到底要比大寺各庄等地略为逊色一些。
    徐水有二百多座水库和两千多眼机井，动力抽水机一千台，已经实现了灌溉机械化。有二十多辆拖拉机，完成了轴承化和正在完成农具改革的半机械化。就是在这样的情况下，大王店聚宝盆水库附近通过锅驼机供养的山药地，一棵秧子就已结了十二斤果实，这自然是正在成长的卫星。大寺各庄的卫星山药更是花样繁多，毛主席看过的一种粪堆形山药，是用粪和土垒起一个个堆堆，在堆堆上栽满秧子，既提高了土地利用率，又肥力厚实。还有毛主席看过的一条埂道上分别插秧四行、八行和十二行的山药，把过去每亩两千棵秧子的耕作法发展到这里的每亩一万五千棵，计划产量是从每亩二十万斤直到一百万斤。大寺各庄还有多样化的沼气山药。用粪垒成个堆堆，外面使土密封，土上栽满山药；堆顶上插一个竹管直通粪堆，从竹管上浇下水去催动肥料发酵并放出沼气，这样来养育土层和作物。或是用粪垒成一个长长的对称的山坡，沿着山坡把土砌成一级级的楼梯，在每一级楼梯上栽山药。再就是用粪垒成一个圆锥形的宝塔，再沿着塔坡把土砌成一层层环形的梯级，在每个梯级上栽山药。这后面两种沼气堆的顶部，也都插入了浇水的竹管。此外，大寺各庄的多样化的沼气堆，现在已经发展到栽种徐水有名的大白菜，或是栽种萝卜。所有这些利用沼气或不利用沼气的卫星作物，不仅粪大水勤，而且还施钾肥、喷磷肥和洒生长素，大寺各庄亩产百万斤的山药，甚至还浇狗肉汤。
    一亩山药一百二十万斤
    沼气作物和使狗肉汤肥田，并不是大寺各庄所独有。漕河人民公社的漕庄，有一块二亩六分地的沼气试验场，那里更是花团锦簇。那是当地过去的乡党委第一书记刘廷奎所主持的科学研究组的野外试验室，组员有乡技术员曹清海，村支部书记魏克敏和过去的村农业社主任魏文林，以及其它几个社员。那片长方形的地里，最北头的中部是一个二分地的塔形沼气山药堆，十五层环形梯级，折合平地四分，插秧五万棵。西侧六个小堆，有三堆沼气山药，共占地一分，插秧数各为三千五、一千七和一千五百棵；另外还有三堆不带沼气的山药。这几个堆堆大小都相同，是为了比较有无沼气和稀密栽植的好坏而采取不同措施的。南面还有一亩拱圆形的沼气山药，下铺一层平均二尺厚的马粪，上面是粪土，再上面一层是好土；这个立体折合平地一亩三，插秧七十五万棵。此外，两侧的零星空地还有一些平地沼气山药，和一亩六千棵的给秧子搭了架的山药。那一亩拱形山药计划产一百二十万斤，只要每一棵上长斤半多山药，七十五万棵秧子就可保证这个卫星数字；从眼时的生产情况来看，这一颗卫星的上天应该说是毫无问题，因为一棵长一二斤山药本来就是值不得一提的低产。那二分塔堆上的五万秧子，看现在的情况，也可以成为亩产百万的卫星射上天去。一亩六千棵的搭架山药，共灌了四条狗的肉汤，也已长成了茁壮的卫星模样，看来同样会直上云霄。
    一棵白菜五百斤
    这块沼气试验场的南端和两侧，还有磨盘形的、圆瓦形的以及每条埂道上种四行或六行的白菜和萝卜。从白菜卫星来说，大寺各庄有一分地堆了四十个方形的立体，每个立体面积二平方尺，每个立体上要求长一棵五百斤的大白菜；漕庄试验场的平地上也有计划培育成每棵五百斤的白菜。而漕庄试验场地的中央空地上，还有用大瓦罐和大花盆摆成“卫星”二字的一片试验作物，罐内和盆内种了四样不同的萝卜和许多白菜；有一个大花盆移栽了一棵多穗玉米，给打了五C．C．葡萄糖；另外一个盆里是一棵山药，主秧分出十三株，又用压蔓而变成二十六株，连同主秧，共二十七处长山药；这棵山药注射了二十C．C．葡萄糖，要求单产一百斤。这整个试验场原来是一片荒坟野地，但现在，紧邻这里的保定郊区每天都有人过来游览，说是来逛花园。
    小麦亩产十二万斤
    漕庄也和大寺各庄与谢坊一样，是已经电气化的村子。沼气试验场里也就有电灯设备，有夜晚亮堂堂的科学研究组的试验棚兼宿舍棚。试验场边还正在修建一个水塔，准备以后给这里作人工降雨。现在试验场边还翻了一亩地准备种冬小麦，由于我在很早以前和刘廷奎研究过高产小麦的事，他也就曾在那一亩地边诡秘地?着眼儿笑问我：
    “你猜猜这亩小麦要搞多少万斤？”
    “八万？”我反问着。这是我听说过的最高的数字。
    “嘻嘻”，刘廷奎用巴掌捂着嘴唇，悄悄笑道：“我跟你坦白了吧！这搞的是十二万斤！”
    想要亩产十二万斤小麦！我实在不相信世界上曾有任何人听说过这种事。我问刘廷奎的措施，他告我说，现在是在让伏天的太阳照晒翻开的土，然后深掘七尺，把地下的红土层翻上来同好土和匀；施底肥三十万斤；种籽先进行人工培育，刚出芽的工夫播下，防止粪大烧芽；土地叠成堆形，利用沼气养育；人工降雨浇灌，用最多最好的化肥分批追补；播籽一千斤，每平方公分一粒；每棵长八十粒小麦，就是亩产十二万斤。
    多么豪壮的雄心！多么宏伟的气魄！刘廷奎还在培育多色棉花和新的山药品种，并在个人生活上攒钱买照相机；他要用照片来记录科学试验的过程，用照片表扬先进和推动工作。他有着冲破天的乐观和朝气，一刻也不放松向别人学习。用狗肉汤上地，就是从大田人民公社党委第一书记高玉生那儿受启发而来。他同高玉生以及现在漕河人民公社党委第一书记师义发，是长期竞赛的死对头和互相学习的好同志。师义发在南亭村搞了大面积的多穗玉米卫星，如今棵棵近丈高，每棵九、十个穗。刘廷奎也搞了八十亩高产多穗玉米，并搞了多穗高粱。这些卫星作物在大寺各庄和谢坊也都茂盛无比。他们和大寺各庄都还搞了每亩四十万棵的卫星谷，现在棵高一公尺多，秸秆粗如木棍，穗长五寸，至少可以达到亩产两万斤。
    皮棉亩产五千斤
    最后还该回到大寺各庄，回到那儿的七亩棉花地。那里毛主席看过的三棵棉枝都绑上了红布。每亩四千棵，平均高六尺，谁看了都说那是棉花树。每棵平均果枝二十五个，成铃四十个，花蕾四十五个；成铃最多的已达一棵一百一十个，眼前的情况就可亩产皮棉近二千斤。但人们还要叫棉棵长到八尺高，叫每棵长一百二十个棉铃，以保证亩产五千斤皮棉。这七亩地的耕作有稀密对比和早晚对比的，还有搭起棚子，晚上在棚顶盖被单，棚下用电灯光照明和催生的一片。这里亩施底肥五万四千斤，过磷酸钙一百二十斤；追硫铵四次，共用一百七十斤；追氮肥一次，生长素和钾盐各四次，喷磷四次，除虫七次；锄八遍，浇水两次，整枝十八次。这片棉花已有中央和省的负责同志再三说过要赶快拍成电影。这片棉花将如许多人所说今年秋后农业上不知要出现多少吓人的高产怪事那样，会如卫星般地震动湖海山川。
  全县粮食亩产二千斤
    所有这些将要发射的高产卫星，和徐水的大面积丰产田连成一气，要把这儿的粮食亩产从去年的二百一十四斤提高到今年的两千斤。人民公社的建立和毛主席的视察，就是目前争取两千斤的足以使山倒海平的力量。这些将要发射的卫星庄稼，是在迈向共产主义的人民公社殿堂上空飘扬的鲜明耀眼的红旗；也只有人民公社才能竖起这样的红旗。试想想，一个二分地的沼气山药堆就得花去成百个人工，成本更是不可计算；这可除了几万人大的人民公社，哪一个普通农业社能够办得到！
    唱不尽人民公社的优越性，颂不完人民公社的灿烂前程。徐水的人民公社将会在不远的期间，把社员们带向人类历史上最高的仙境，这就是那“各尽所能，各取所需”的自由王国的时光。
