    After the Party called on the whole Party and all the people to fight for steel, Hou Rongqing, the First Secretary of our Fengjie County Party Committee, and Zhang Baorong, the Secretary in charge of industry, stayed in our factory to supervise the battle. Every day they would go to the site, sometimes up to the blast furnace, sometimes to the foundry workshop, sometimes down to the mine, and they would stay for several hours at a time, sometimes until twelve o'clock at night before going to rest. The comrades all said, "If the county party secretaries are fighting so hard, shouldn't we work harder?" Now we often work two shifts in a row, working for more than ten hours at a time. As long as we can produce more iron and produce it quickly, what does a little tiredness matter? The secretaries also spoke to everyone, explaining the call of the Party Central Committee and telling everyone that not even an ounce of the pig iron task could be reduced. Their words, like a furnace fire, made the hearts of every steelworker bright and hot.

    After the county party secretaries arrived at the steel front, they directly promoted production. They always went to the weak links in production, immediately studied the problems, and solved them immediately. The No. 2 blast furnace had to be completed before September 15, but the foundry workshop did not have enough sand, and it had to be carried from ten or twenty miles away. After the secretary learned about this, he transferred eighty or ninety comrades to carry sand specifically. They studied the problem that the blast furnace was not getting enough to "eat", and they found the mine to consult with the mining workers and changed to using hand-operated rock drills, and the output of ore increased. For the blast furnace batching, they decided to change from the original 260 jin of ore to 320 jin, and as a result, they produced three or four more tons of iron every day.

    With such comrades taking the lead, how could we fail to complete the task of producing iron that the Party gave us!

    县委书记来到现场以后
    奉节县第三炼铁厂工人  王学洪  张德阳
    自从党号召全党全民为钢而战以后，我们的县委第一书记侯荣卿同志和主管工业的书记张宝荣同志，都住到我们厂里来督战了。他们每天都要到现场来，有时上高炉，有时到翻砂车间，有时下矿洞，一来就是几小时，有时一直到深夜十二点，还不去休息。同志们都说，县委书记都这样苦战，我们还不该多加一把劲吗？我们现在常常连赶两班，一干就是十几小时。只要能多出铁快出铁，累点算得什么？书记们还同大家讲了话，解释了党中央的号召，告诉大家生铁任务一斤不能少，他们的话，就跟炉火一样，使我们每个钢铁工人的心，又亮又热。
    县委书记来到钢铁前沿阵地以后，在生产上也直接起了推动作用。他们总是到一些薄弱的生产环节上，马上研究，马上解决问题。二高炉9月15日以前一定要完工，但是翻砂车间砂不够，要到一、二十里外去挑，书记了解到以后，就调来了八九十个同志，专门去挑砂。他们研究了高炉吃不饱的问题，就找到矿井里找矿工商量，改用了手摇搬钻，矿石的产量就增加了。高炉配料，他们决定从原来的二百六十斤矿石改成三百二十斤，结果每天就多出三、四吨铁。
    有这样一些同志领着头干，党给我们的生产铁的任务，怎么会完不成呢！
