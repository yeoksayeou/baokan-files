Comrades:

　　I, representing the National Trade Union, resolutely support Premier Zhou Enlai's solemn statement regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait.

　　Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are our territory. It is entirely our internal affair for the Chinese people to exercise sovereignty and liberate these areas. It is the sacred and inviolable right of the Chinese people. This is our internal affair and absolutely no interference from U.S. imperialism is permitted!

　　In order to divert the attention of the world's people, evade condemnation from world public opinion, delay the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon, and continue its aggression in the Middle East, U.S. imperialism is massing its forces in the Taiwan Strait. On September 4th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles issued a murderous and robber-like statement, openly threatening to expand the scope of aggression against our country in the Taiwan Strait area and carry out war provocations, thereby intensifying the tense situation created by U.S. imperialism in this region and seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. U.S. imperialism is not only the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people but also the most ferocious enemy of all national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and of the world peace movement. We express boundless anger and resolute protest against Dulles's robber-like statement! We must seriously warn Dulles that the Chinese people who have stood up are absolutely not to be intimidated! If U.S. imperialism disregards the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world and continues to carry out aggression and interference against our country, imposing war on the Chinese people, the 600 million Chinese people will resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate the aggressors!

　　U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger. We fought U.S. imperialism on the Korean battlefield. The result of that contest was the shameful defeat of U.S. imperialism. Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people are even stronger. The international situation is even more favorable to us. All working people and peace-loving people around the world are our backing, especially the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is even stronger. The surging tide of national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the growing strength of the worldwide movement to defend peace are the strongest backing for the Chinese people. In such a situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, if U.S. imperialism is unwilling to learn from the past and dares to contend with us, then the only path ahead of it is death.

　　Comrades workers throughout the country, when our motherland is facing the military threat and war provocations of U.S. imperialist aggressors, we must, under the leadership of the Party and together with the people of the whole country, redouble our efforts, aim high, and build socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, especially to resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and strive to complete the combat mission of 10.7 million tons of steel this year. With steel, we can accelerate socialist construction; with steel, we can better support the people's commune movement; with steel, we can further consolidate our powerful national defense forces. We guarantee to the Party and to the motherland: We have the people! We have the steel! We are ready to contribute everything for the needs of the motherland at any time. We are builders of peaceful labor, but at the same time, we are staunch fighters defending the motherland and defending peace. We love peace, but we are never afraid of war. We must thoroughly smash the military threats and war provocations of U.S. imperialism. We must liberate Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. Jinmen and Mazu are islands in the inland sea of our mainland. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched on these islands directly threaten the security of the mainland. The Chinese people cannot tolerate this, and they must be resolutely liberated. No intimidation, no threat can shake our determination!

　　刘宁一代表全国职工保证：
　　要人有人　要钢有钢
　　同志们：
    我代表全国职工坚决拥护周恩来总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的庄严声明。
    台湾和澎湖列岛是我国的领土。我国人民行使主权解放这些地区，完全是我国的内政。是我国人民的神圣不可侵犯的权利。这是我国内政，绝不容许美帝国主义干涉！
    美帝国主义为了转移世界人民的视线、逃避世界舆论的谴责、拖延从黎巴嫩撤兵、继续对中东侵略，却在台湾海峡集结兵力，9月4日，由美国国务卿杜勒斯发表了一个杀气腾腾的强盗声明，公然威胁要在台湾海峡地区扩大对我国的侵略范围，进行战争挑衅，从而加剧了美帝国主义在这个地区造成的紧张局势，使远东和世界和平遭到严重的威胁。美帝国主义不仅是我国人民最凶恶的敌人，也是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲一切民族独立运动和世界和平运动的最凶恶的敌人。我们对杜勒斯的强盗声明，表示无比愤怒和坚决抗议！我们要严重警告杜勒斯，站起来的中国人民是绝对吓不倒的！如果美帝国主义悍然不顾我国人民再三的警告和全世界人民的和平愿望，继续对我国进行侵略和干涉，把战争强加在我国人民头上，我国六亿人民一定要把侵略者坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭！
    美帝国主义者是一只纸老虎。我们和美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上较量过。较量的结果，是美帝国主义遭到了可耻的失败。现在中国人民在中国共产党的领导下是更加强大了。国际形势是更加有利于我们了。全世界一切劳动人民和爱好和平的人民都是我们的后盾，特别是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加强大，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族独立运动的风起云涌，全世界保卫和平运动的日益壮大，更是我国人民最坚强的后盾。在这样一个东风压倒西风的形势下面，如果美帝国主义不愿意接受过去的教训，敢于和我们较量，那末，摆在它前面的只有死路一条。
    全国工人同志们，当我们的祖国面临着美帝国主义侵略者的军事威胁和战争挑衅的时候，我们必须在党的领导下，和全国人民一道，更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地进行社会主义建设，尤其是要坚决响应党中央的号召，为完成今年一千零七十万吨钢的战斗任务而奋斗。有了钢，我们可以加快社会主义建设，有了钢，我们就可以更好地支援人民公社运动，有了钢，我们就可以更加巩固强大的国防力量。我们向党、向祖国保证：要人有人、要钢有钢，随时准备为了祖国的需要贡献一切。我们是和平劳动的建设者，但同时，我们又是保卫祖国、保卫和平的坚强战士。我们热爱和平，但是，我们决不怕战争。我们要彻底粉碎美帝国主义的军事威胁和战争挑衅。一定要解放台湾和澎湖列岛。金门和马祖是我国大陆内海岛屿，盘踞这些岛屿的蒋匪军，直接威胁大陆安全，中国人民尤其不能容忍，必须坚决解放。任何恫吓、任何威胁是动摇不了我们的决心的！
