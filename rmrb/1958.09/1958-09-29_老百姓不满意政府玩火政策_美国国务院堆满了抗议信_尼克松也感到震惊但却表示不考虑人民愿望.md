Xinhua News Agency, New York, 26th (TASS dispatch): According to the "New York Times," ever since the American ruling clique has been carrying out military provocations against China in the Far East, the U.S. State Department has been constantly receiving a large number of letters from ordinary people, the vast majority of which sharply criticize the U.S. government's playing-with-fire policy or express concern about the situation in the Far East.

The newspaper pointed out that since August 23, the U.S. State Department has received several thousand letters. Approximately 80% of the letters directly criticize the U.S. government's policy or express concern about it.

According to the newspaper, most of the letters from the masses were received within two weeks after Eisenhower delivered a radio speech on the Jinmen and Mazu issue, threatening war. In the past week alone, the State Department received no less than three thousand letters. The number of letters this week is roughly the same.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 28th: U.S. Vice President Nixon said in a conversation on the 27th that he was "shocked" by the news that a large number of public letters recently received by the U.S. State Department opposed the U.S. government's war-adventurous policy in the Taiwan Strait. The news said that since the U.S. stirred up tensions in the Taiwan Strait, the State Department has received approximately five thousand letters from the American public, the vast majority of which criticize the U.S. government's policy and demand that the U.S. stay out of the war.

In order to evade public criticism, Nixon had to hypocritically acknowledge verbally that it "is constructive and beneficial" for the people to express their opinions to their elected representatives through letters. However, he disregarded the wishes of American voters and insisted on the U.S.'s war-adventurous policy. He said, "This must never be regarded as the decisive factor in determining policy direction," and cannot "indulge in the idea that foreign policy decisions should be made based on public opinion polls." He said that if they did that, "we could very well decide how to hand over our world leadership to the Communists and become a second-rate country."

Nixon attempted to create war hysteria among the American public, saying that the responsibility of a leader is to "lead public opinion rather than follow behind it." He repeated the hackneyed tune of the U.S. aggression policy, saying, "What is at stake in the Formosa (referring to Taiwan) Strait is not Jinmen and Mazu, nor Formosa, but the position of the entire free world in the Far East."

    老百姓不满意政府玩火政策
    美国国务院堆满了抗议信
    尼克松也感到震惊但却表示不考虑人民愿望
    新华社28日讯  据塔斯社纽约26日讯：据“纽约时报”报道，自从美国统治集团在远东地区对中国进行军事挑衅以来，美国国务院不断收到普通人民的大批来信，其中绝大多数对美国政府的玩火政策进行了尖锐的抨击，或是对远东局势表示担忧。
    这家报纸指出，从8月23日起，美国国务院就收到了几千封信。约有80％的信直接批评了美国政府的政策，或者对这种政策表示忧虑。
    据这家报纸透露，大部分群众来信是在艾森豪威尔就金门、马祖问题发表进行战争威胁的广播演说之后的两周内收到的。仅仅在上星期里国务院收到的信件就不下三千封。本星期的信件数量也大致相同。
    新华社28日讯  华盛顿消息：美国副总统尼克松27日在一次谈话中说，他对美国国务院最近收到的公众来信中有大量信件反对美国政府在台湾海峡的战争冒险政策的消息“感到震惊”。消息说，自从美国在台湾海峡挑起紧张局势以来，国务院收到美国公众大约五千封信，其中绝大多数都对美国政府的政策提出批评，要求美国置身于战争之外。
    为了回避舆论的指责，尼克松口头上不得不假惺惺地承认，人民用信件向他们选出的代表表示意见“是建设性的也是有好处的”。但是，他却又无视美国选民的愿望，坚持美国的战争冒险政策。他说，“这决不能被认为是决定政策方针的决定性因素”，不能“沉迷于这样一种想法，即应当根据民意测验作出外交政策的决定”。他说，这样“我们就很可以决定怎样将我们的世界领导地位交给共产党人并且成为第二流国家”。
    尼克松企图为美国公众制造战争歇斯底里的舆论，他说，一个领导人的责任是“领导舆论而不是跟在舆论的后面”。他重弹美国侵略政策的滥调说，“在福摩萨（指台湾）海峡处于危险中的不是金门和马祖也不是福摩萨，而是整个自由世界在远东的地位。”
