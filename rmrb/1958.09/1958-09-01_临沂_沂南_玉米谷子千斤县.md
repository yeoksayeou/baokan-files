Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 31st. Linyi County, Shandong Province, has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of corn and millet, with average yields exceeding 1,000 jin per mu. This year, the county planted 168,257 mu of spring corn, with an average yield of 1,171 jin and 7 liang per mu, and a total output increase of 588.74% compared to last year. The per unit yield increased by 71%. The county planted 60,231 mu of millet, with an average yield of 1,088 jin and 6 liang per mu, and a total output increase of 290.3% compared to last year. The per unit yield increased by 597.8%.

The large-scale bumper harvest of corn and millet in this county is mainly due to the following successful work:

(1) Putting politics in command. Since the beginning of spring, party organizations at all levels have resolutely implemented the mass line, fully relied on the masses, and used the method of airing views, debates, and big-character posters to launch struggles against the "watch-the-tide faction," the "accounting faction," and those advocating "conditions theory," mobilizing all positive factors. (2) Party organizations at all levels have used experimental fields as a base to promote advanced experiences and strengthen technical guidance. The county's corn and millet have all been deeply plowed, rationally fertilized, and rationally densely planted.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 31st. Yinan County, Shandong Province, has 57,054 mu of spring corn, with an average yield of 1,064 jin per mu. Among them, 9,367 mu have a yield of 1,500 jin per mu, 1,743 mu have a yield of 2,000 jin per mu, 424 mu have a yield of 2,500 jin per mu, and 301 mu have a yield of 3,000 jin per mu.

The important reasons for Yinan County becoming a thousand-jin county for corn are, first, launching airing views and debates to liberate thoughts. Second, grasping field management. Third, the secretary personally taking action, and cadres at all levels vigorously engaging in experimental fields. Fourth, regular inspections and evaluations, and carrying out red flag competitions. Fifth, deep plowing, dense planting, fertilization, watering, and weeding were all done well.

　　临沂  沂南  玉米谷子千斤县
    据新华社济南31日电　山东省临沂县玉米、谷子获得大面积丰收，平均亩产都在一千斤以上。这个县今年种春玉米十六万八千二百五十七亩，平均亩产一千一百七十一斤七两，总产量较去年增加588.74％，单产增产71％。全县共种谷子六万零二百三十一亩，平均亩产一千零八十八斤六两，总产较去年增长290.3％，单产增长597.8％。
    这个县的玉米、谷子大面积丰收，主要是由于搞好了以下工作：
    （一）政治挂帅。从入春以来，各级党的组织坚决贯彻群众路线，充分依靠群众，用鸣放辩论的方法向“观潮派”、“算账派”和“条件论”者开展了斗争，调动了一切积极因素。（二）各级党组织均以试验田为基地，推广先进经验，加强技术指导。这个县的玉米和谷子全部进行了深翻，并合理施肥和合理密植。
    据新华社济南31日电　山东省沂南县五万七千零五十四亩春玉米，平均亩产一千零六十四斤。其中亩产一千五百斤的有九千三百六十七亩，亩产二千斤的有一千七百四十三亩，亩产二千五百斤的有四百二十四亩，亩产三千斤的有三百零一亩。
    沂南县成为玉米千斤县的重要原因首先是展开鸣放辩论，解放思想。其次是抓住田间管理。再次，书记亲自动手，各级干部大搞试验田。第四，定期检查评比，开展红旗竞赛。第五，深翻、密植、施肥、浇水、中耕除草等工作都做得较好。
