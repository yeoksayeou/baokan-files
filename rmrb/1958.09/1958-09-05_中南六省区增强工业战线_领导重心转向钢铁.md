　　Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: After the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year, party and government leaders and the masses in various provinces and autonomous regions of the Central South region have quickly taken action to fight for steel and ensure the completion of this year's steel production plan.
　　The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently decided that from the provincial party secretary to every member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, everyone must grasp steel production and participate in steel experimental plots. At the same time, the province transferred more than 140 metallurgical technicians to form a "steel mobile medical team" to go to various places to help newly built furnaces quickly put into normal production. The focus of the leadership of the local party committees has shifted to steel production. In Luoyang and Xinyang prefectures alone, 570,000 steel soldiers have been assembled, some of whom are divided into specialized teams for transportation, smelting, and mining. In order to solve the transportation problem, Luoyang Prefecture alone organized a "motor vehicle division" and a "horse-drawn carriage division" to specialize in transporting ore and coal for ironmaking. In recent days, iron-smelting furnaces with a daily output of 7,000 tons have been producing day and night throughout the province.
　　The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of the Standing Committee on the afternoon of September 1st, first requiring the party committee to firmly grasp unified leadership and unified arrangements, to handle both steel production and the establishment of people's communes at the same time, and to unify the leadership of the two. The province must immediately mobilize a million-strong army to produce steel. The first secretary of the party committee must take the lead and personally engage in steel "experimental furnaces" to strengthen specific leadership. Each prefectural and county party committee should select counties and townships with better natural conditions and convenient transportation as key points, and first focus on doing a good job in these key areas. On the same evening, the Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference with the first secretaries of the local party committees and relevant responsible cadres to specifically deploy steel production.
　　The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hunan Provincial People's Committee jointly held a broadcast conference on the evening of September 2nd, entitled "Mobilizing the People of the Province to March Towards Steel in a Big Way." The Provincial Party Committee requested that every effort be made to complete most of the steel production tasks for the next four months ahead of schedule in September and October. In the near future, we should focus on grabbing iron production, reaching a daily output of 10,000 tons by the end of September, and concentrate our efforts on completing this year's steel production tasks.
　　The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to complete the construction of 20,000 to 25,000 new furnaces in September to ensure that each furnace produces iron, production is normal, and the daily output of pig iron reaches 10,000 tons. In order to achieve this requirement, the Provincial Party Committee proposed that the first secretary of party organizations at all levels must personally grasp the construction of new furnaces.
　　The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and local party committees and county committees have recently held continuous meetings to determine that the province will complete the task of smelting 280,000 tons of steel before the end of the year, not one pound less. Currently, the Provincial Party Committee has been led by Tao Zhu, the first secretary. The Provincial Party Committee requires that the first secretaries of all municipal and prefectural party committees (including the Hainan District Party Committee) and the county committees of the 22 key iron-smelting counties must personally take the lead, grasping steel production with one hand and late-rice grain production with the other. The main tasks of prefectures and counties, especially counties, are iron smelting, and the task of steel smelting mainly relies on the city of Guangzhou. Each prefecture and county must ensure that the smelted pig iron is continuously transported to Guangzhou. The Provincial Party Committee emphasized that outstanding achievements must be made in steel production in September to lay the foundation for production in October to December.
　　The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward the slogan "Fighting hard for half a month to ensure that all built blast furnaces have smooth iron flow and all converters produce steel," and resolutely complete this year's steel production tasks. Now the first secretaries of the local party committees, municipal party committees, and the vast majority of county party committees in the autonomous region have personally taken the lead. Counties such as Huanjiang and Ningming have organized professional teams such as the "Steel Field Army" and the "Steel Corps" with more than 10,000 people to go to the mines to mine, transport, and build furnaces for iron smelting.
　　Many areas in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have also organized experienced technical cadres and workers to form "mobile steel medical teams," taking measures such as holding on-site meetings and organizing visits to overcome technical difficulties in steel production.

　　中南六省区增强工业战线
　　领导重心转向钢铁
    据新华社4日讯　中共中央政治局扩大会议发出全年生产一千零七十万吨钢的号召以后，中南地区各省、自治区党政领导和群众已迅速行动起来，为钢铁而战，保证完成今年的钢铁生产计划。
    中共河南省委最近决定从省委书记到每个省委常委委员，都要抓钢铁生产，要参加钢铁试验田。同时，全省抽调了一百四十多名冶炼技术人员组成“钢铁巡回医疗队”，分赴各地帮助新建炉迅速投入正常生产。各地委的领导重点都已转移到钢铁生产上来。仅洛阳和信阳两专区就集结了五十七万钢铁大军，有的分成运输、冶炼、采矿等专业队。为了解决交通运输问题，仅洛阳专区就组织了一个“汽车师”和一个“马车师”，专门运输矿石和炼铁用煤。近几天来全省已有日产七千吨的炼铁炉日夜进行生产。
    中共湖北省委在1日下午召开常委会议，首先要党委抓紧统一领导、统一安排，把办钢铁和办人民公社两件事同时办好，把两件事统一领导起来。全省要立即动员百万大军办钢铁，党委第一书记必须切实挂帅，亲自搞钢铁“试验炉”，加强具体领导。每个地委和县委都要选择自然条件较好、交通比较便利的县、乡作重点，首先把重点搞好。同日晚上，省委召开了有各地委第一书记和有关负责干部参加的电话会议，具体布置了钢铁生产。
    中共湖南省委和湖南省人民委员会在2日晚联合举办了“动员全省人民向钢铁大进军”广播大会。省委要求尽一切可能把今后四个月的钢铁生产任务大部分提前在9、10月份完成。最近一个时期，应该突出地抓出铁，到9月底要达到日产一万吨，要集中力量完成今年的钢铁生产任务。
    中共江西省委决定在9月份完成两万到两万五千个新炉子的建设任务，保证炉炉出铁，生产正常，日产生铁达到一万吨。为了实现这个要求，省委提出了各级党组织第一书记必须亲自抓紧新炉子的建设。
    中共广东省委和各地委、县委近来连续举行会议，确定全省在年底前完成炼钢二十八万吨的任务，一斤不少。目前省委已由第一书记陶铸挂帅。省委要求各市委、地委（包括海南区党委）和二十二个炼铁重点县的县委，都必须由第一书记亲自挂帅，一手抓钢铁，一手抓晚造粮食生产。专区和县，特别是县，主要任务是炼铁，炼钢的任务主要依靠广州市完成。各专区、县就必须保证把炼出的生铁源源运给广州。省委强调指出，9月份在钢铁生产上一定要做出突出的成绩来，为10至12月份的生产打下基础。
    中共广西僮族自治区委员会已提出“苦战半月，保证已建高炉全部铁水畅流，转炉全部出钢”的行动口号，坚决完成今年的钢铁生产任务。现在自治区各地委、市委和绝大部分县委的第一书记都已亲自挂帅。环江、宁明等县组织了万人以上的“钢铁野战军”和“钢铁兵团”等专业队，到矿山去采矿、运输和建炉炼铁。
    广西僮族自治区的许多地区还组织了有经验的技术干部和工人，成立“巡回钢铁医疗队”，采取开现场会议、组织参观等方法，克服钢铁生产中的技术困难。
