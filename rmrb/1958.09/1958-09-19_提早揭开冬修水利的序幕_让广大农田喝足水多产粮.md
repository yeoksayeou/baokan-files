    Unveiling the Prelude to Winter Water Conservancy:
    Letting Vast Farmlands Drink Enough Water to Produce More Grain
    (Our dispatch) The prelude to a larger-scale farmland water conservancy construction upsurge this winter and next spring has already been unveiled. Guangxi, Hunan, Hebei, Guizhou and other provinces (autonomous regions) have taken the lead in starting large-scale water conservancy projects, and some projects in Henan, Anhui, Liaoning, Shandong, Sichuan and other provinces have also started one after another.
    The scale of this water conservancy construction movement is very large from the beginning. In Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, nearly 300 large and medium-sized backbone water conservancy projects have started, benefiting a total area of more than 11 million mu, which accounts for almost half of the water conservancy construction plan for the next year. This autonomous region began a series of construction preparation work after the victorious conclusion of the spring water conservancy construction movement in May this year. After completing the surveying and design work in August, it immediately mobilized a large number of laborers to invest in water conservancy construction projects. In just over ten days, all the large and medium-sized projects planned to be started were started, forming a vigorous water conservancy construction movement. More than 2,000 reservoirs have been started in Hunan Province, and more than 100 of them have been completed. Encouraged by the movement of establishing people's communes, the masses across the province are full of enthusiasm. Young people, women, militia and others have organized construction of "May Fourth," "March Eighth," and "August First" reservoirs as gifts for this year's National Day. According to past work efficiency calculations, the "Chao Ying" reservoir in Changning County would take 800,000 workdays to complete. This time, the masses adopted advanced construction tools and methods, and more than 20,000 people completed it victoriously after eight days and nights of hard work. The civil workers in Xiangtan County also launched a high work efficiency movement to complete 100 cubic meters of earthwork and 10,000 cubic meters of blasting stone per person per day. Guizhou Province, while simultaneously developing industry and transportation, has drawn 20% of its labor force to build water conservancy projects. To date, 159 backbone projects have been started. Xiuwen County has also entered full-scale construction in accordance with the original plan to realize water networking, water conservancy, and soil and water conservation. In Hebei Province, more than 70 large and medium-sized reservoir projects for the comprehensive management of the Haihe River have also started construction. In the past two months, the province has also completed 40,000 machine-operated wells, and is still working day and night to complete another 30,000 wells before wheat planting, so that more than 40 million mu of wheat will all be planted on irrigated land.
    In order to thoroughly realize the requirements of water conservancy this winter and next spring, many areas have put forward ambitious water conservancy plans. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee requires the people of the province to work hard for one winter and one spring to complete the task of 20 billion cubic meters of earth and stone, of which the six-level river channel projects responsible by the province, special districts, counties, townships and communes will reach 300,000 kilometers. It requires all localities to "prepare early, start early, complete early, and utilize early." Now the large-scale preparation work has begun to unfold in an all-round way. The province's water conservancy engineering technicians have gone to various places to carry out surveying, exploration, measurement and design work, and to complete the paving and line setting work before autumn plowing and autumn planting. The design work of all projects will be launched in September to ensure that it does not affect the first step of construction in October. The province plans to train 2 million mass water conservancy technical teams. More than 1 million people have begun training, and the construction organizations of all large and medium-sized projects have been established. Currently, most of the technical teams have arrived at the new construction sites.
    The establishment of people's communes has greatly strengthened the labor force in this water conservancy construction movement. The Longjiang Reservoir project in Yulin County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which irrigates more than 20,000 mu of land, quickly (the second day after the establishment of the commune) organized more than 1,000 laborers to start construction due to the establishment of the Shanxin People's Commune. Xihu and Miaohou Agricultural Cooperatives in Dao County, Hunan Province, had long wanted to open a large canal, but they could not open it due to the limitations of manpower and material resources. After the merger into a people's commune, they immediately transferred labor, and the two canals started construction at the same time. Hongqi People's Commune in Huaiyin County, Jiangsu Province, had difficulty in repairing a drainage ditch before the establishment of the commune. After the establishment of the commune, the plan was revised to open more than 270 medium and small ditches, and at the same time, it was necessary to build a main canal and three branch canals to ensure freedom from drought and flood.
    In order to quickly and comprehensively carry out the water conservancy construction movement, many provinces are continuing to carry out intense preparation work such as formulating plans and training technical forces while starting construction. In particular, in order to improve labor efficiency, many areas are actively carrying out tool reforms and promoting advanced construction experience. According to incomplete statistics from eight provinces and regions including Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Hunan, more than 18 million improved construction tools for transporting and digging earth have been manufactured. Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Sichuan and other provinces are mobilizing the masses to contribute ideas, materials, and labor, and also plan to promote more than 21 million improved water conservancy tools, and strive to use all improved tools as soon as the project starts.

    提早揭开冬修水利的序幕
    让广大农田喝足水多产粮
    本报讯　今冬明春更大规模的农田水利兴修高潮的序幕已经揭开。广西、湖南、河北、贵州等省（区）领先开始了大修水利工程，河南、安徽、辽宁、山东、四川等省的部分工程也已陆续动工了。
    这次兴修水利运动一开始规模就很大。广西僮族自治区目前已有近三百处大中型骨干水利工程开工，总受益面积一千一百多万亩，几乎占下一年度水利兴修计划的一半。这个自治区从今年5月胜利结束了春修水利运动，就着手进行了一系列兴修准备工作。8月份完成了勘测设计工作后，立即调动了大批劳力投入兴修水利工程，仅用十天多时间，计划开工的大、中型工程就全部开工了，形成了一个千军万马热火朝天的兴修水利运动。湖南省已有二千多座水库开工，其中有一百多座已经完工。在办人民公社运动鼓舞下，全省群众干劲冲天，青年、妇女、民兵等纷纷组织兴修“五四”、“三八”、“八一”等水库，做为今年国庆节献礼。常宁县“超英”水库，按以往工效计算，八十万工日才能完工，这次群众采取了先进的施工工具和方法，二万多人经八昼夜的苦战就胜利完成了。湘潭全县民工还展开了每日每人完成土工一百公方、一炮炸石一万公方的高工效运动。贵州省在工业、交通业同时并举的情况下，抽出了20％的劳力兴修水利，到目前已有一百五十九处骨干工程动工兴建。修文县并按照原订的实现水网化、水利化和水土保持化的计划，进入了全面施工。河北省根治海河工程有七十多座大、中型水库工程也已经开工兴修了。这个省最近两个月来还打成机井四万眼，目前还在昼夜鏖战，争取种麦前再完成三万眼，使四千多万亩小麦全部种在水浇地上。
    为在今冬明春彻底实现水利化的要求，许多地区已提出了宏伟的水利计划。山东省委要求全省人民苦战一冬一春，完成二百亿土、石方的任务，其中仅省、专区、县、乡、社负责的六级河道工程，就将达到三十万公里。要求各地“早准备、早动工、早完成、早利用”，现在规模宏大的准备工作已经开始全面展开。省的水利工程技术人员已分赴各地进行勘察、钻探、测量和设计工作，在秋耕秋种前作好铺工定线工作。9月份所有工程的设计工作都要展开，以保证不影响10月份开工的第一步工程。全省计划训练二百万名群众性的水利技术队伍，目前已有一百多万名开始训练，所有大、中型工程的施工机构，已经建立起来，目前技术队伍大部分都到达了新工地。
    人民公社的建立，使这次水利兴修运动中的劳力大大加强了。广西僮族自治区玉林县的灌溉二万多亩地的龙江水库工程，由于山心人民公社的成立，很快（公社成立的第二天）就组织了一千多劳力动工兴建了。湖南省道县西湖、庙后两个农业社早就想开条大渠，但因人力、物力限制一直开不成，并社成立人民公社后，马上抽调劳力，两条渠道同时动工。江苏省淮阴县红旗人民公社，建社前想修一条排水沟都很困难，成立公社后修订了计划，要开二百七十多条中、小沟，同时还要修一条总干渠和三条分干渠，做到旱涝无忧。
    为了迅速、全面地开展兴修水利运动，许多省份一面着手施工，还一面继续进行紧张的制定规划、培训技术力量等准备工作。特别是为了提高劳动效率，许多地区在积极进行工具改革和推广先进的施工经验。据河南、山西、陕西、广西、贵州、云南、湖南等八个省区的不完全统计，已经制造各种改良的运土、挖土等施工工具一千八百多万件。山东、江苏、浙江、福建、江西、四川等省正在发动群众献计、献料、献劳力，同时还计划推广改良水利工具二千一百多万件，并争取工程一开工，就全部使用上改良工具。
