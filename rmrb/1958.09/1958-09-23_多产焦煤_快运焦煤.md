Produce More Coking Coal, Transport Coking Coal Quickly
By a Staff Commentator

Coke is the primary fuel for iron smelting, and coking coal is the raw material for coke. To fulfill the task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year, 400,000 native and small blast furnaces have been built nationwide, and millions of people are fighting for steel every day. This new situation requires coal miners to produce more coking coal, and also requires railway, highway, and shipping workers to transport the coking coal to the blast furnaces in a timely manner.

According to the Ministry of Coal Industry's assessment of the current coking coal production situation, completing the coking coal production task required for 10.7 million tons of steel by the end of the year is not a problem. The current issue is completing the annual production task ahead of schedule. This is because it takes time to transport the coking coal from the mine to the coking site, and from coke to iron and steel making. In other words, if the coking coal production plan is only completed by the end of the year, then there will be no time for the transportation of the last batch of coking coal, as well as the coking, ironmaking, and steelmaking processes, and the task of 10.7 million tons of steel will not be completed. Coal miners should speed up their pace and launch a high-yield campaign to strive to complete the annual production plan half a month ahead of schedule. In this way, we can ensure the complete realization of the plan to double steel production, and at the same time have some time to prepare ironmaking fuel for next year. Each mining area should also promote the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, and on the premise of ensuring the completion of non-coking coal production tasks, transfer a part of the workers and technicians to support the production of coking coal as much as possible.

Currently, the leading comrades of some mines have not concentrated their energy on production, resulting in the poor completion of the coking coal production plan. In order to produce more coal, and produce coal faster, ensuring that there is as much as ironmaking needs and available whenever it is needed, the leading comrades of all coal mines must concentrate their efforts on coal production, sleep at the mines, and share weal and woe with the coal miners, so that the next few months will truly become high-yield months.

The timely transportation of coking coal is a pressing task at present. If the coking coal cannot be transported out, firstly, the blast furnace will have no fuel and cannot produce iron; secondly, the coal mined by the coal mine will have no place to put it, which will affect normal production. Therefore, railway, highway, and shipping departments must adopt a fighting posture, support the struggle on the steel front as they supported the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and do everything possible to transport the coking coal required for 10.7 million tons of steel ahead of schedule.

There are two main problems with transportation at present. One is that the loading and unloading capacity is insufficient, and the goods stay at the stations and ports for too long. In order to accelerate the turnover rate of vehicles and ships and improve transportation efficiency, we must rely on the local Party committees to mobilize the masses, mobilize all available manpower, organize a large-scale loading and unloading army, and reverse the blockage of stations and ports with the spirit of ants moving Mount Tai. The other is that the transportation capacity is insufficient. To solve this contradiction, in addition to mobilizing all available transportation tools to participate in the battle, the main method is to rank the materials that need to be transported in order of importance and treat them differently according to their urgency. Materials related to steel and machinery production should be transported first, and others should be transported later.

Some people worry that implementing queuing will disrupt the original transportation order and cause protests from departments whose materials are scheduled for later transportation. Of course, arranging a new transportation order according to the new situation will inevitably disrupt the old order. "No destruction, no construction." If the old order is not broken, the new order cannot be established. It is inevitable that there will be some "chaos" during the "destruction" and "construction" process. However, this kind of "chaos" is not worth worrying about. As the old saying goes: "Order can only follow chaos, and stability can only follow order." This means that only after chaos can the contradictions of things be fully exposed, and people can more clearly and comprehensively understand the laws of the development of things, and then they can formulate effective measures. Therefore, we should not be afraid of the "chaos" in the Great Leap Forward. The main thing is to explore a set of revolutionary transportation methods in this "chaos". It is also natural for departments whose materials are scheduled for later transportation to protest. Construction and transportation must distinguish between priorities and treat them differently, and cannot start everything at the same time. "Only by not doing some things can one accomplish other things." Only by not transporting those materials that should not be transported, or by temporarily delaying those materials that can be delayed, can we have the strength to transport those important and necessary materials.

In order to complete the coking coal transportation task in a timely manner, we must resolutely eliminate all unreasonable transportation phenomena and reduce man-made tension. This must be approached from two aspects. On the one hand, relevant departments should rationally arrange the allocation of coking coal, eliminate opposite transportation, and reduce long-distance transportation as much as possible. On the other hand, the metallurgical departments must liberate their minds and break the superstition that only coke can be used for iron smelting. Coke ironmaking does have its advantages, which cannot be denied. However, it is not "the only option." White coal (anthracite) can also be used for iron smelting, and Jinsha County in Guizhou Province has generally done so. The key now is to break superstition, liberate minds, and earnestly promote these experiences. The distribution of coking coal in our country is extremely uneven. Places with ore do not necessarily have coking coal, but only white coal or other types of coal. Promoting the experience of using non-coke for iron smelting can not only alleviate the tight supply of coking coal and avoid long-distance transportation and opposite transportation, but also fully utilize resources nearby and reduce iron smelting costs, which is of great economic significance.

The battle on the steel front has entered the most intense stage. Miners, transportation workers, dedicate your great wisdom and courage to producing more coking coal, producing coking coal earlier, and transporting coking coal faster!

    多产焦煤　快运焦煤
    本报评论员
    焦炭是炼铁的主要燃料，而焦煤又是焦炭的原料。为了完成今年产钢一千零七十万吨的任务，全国已建成了四十万个土高炉、小高炉，每天有几千万人为钢铁而战斗。这个新形势，要求煤矿工人生产更多的焦煤，也要求铁路、公路、航运的工人们，及时地把焦煤运到高炉跟前去。
    据煤炭工业部按照现在焦煤生产的情况来看，到年底完成一千零七十万吨钢所需要的焦煤的生产任务是不成问题的。现在成问题的是提前完成全年的生产任务。因为焦煤生产出来以后，从矿山运到炼焦的地方，从焦炭到炼铁、炼钢都需要时间。这就是说，如果到年底才能完成焦煤的生产计划，那末，最后一批焦煤的运输，以及炼焦、炼铁和炼钢的时间就没有了，一千零七十万吨钢的任务就完不成。煤矿的工人们应该加快步伐，开展一个高产运动，争取提前半个月完成全年的生产计划。这样，我们便可以保证钢产翻一番计划的完全实现，同时也有一定时间为明年准备炼铁燃料。每一个矿区还应当发扬互助协作精神，在保证完成非焦煤生产任务的条件下，尽可能地抽调一部分工人和技术人员去支援焦煤的生产。
    现在有的矿山的领导同志，没有集中精力抓生产，结果焦煤的生产计划完成得不好。为了多出煤，快出煤，保证炼铁要多少有多少，什么时候要什么时候有。所有煤矿的领导同志，必须把力量集中到煤的生产上来，睡到矿山上去，和采煤工人同甘共苦，使今后的几个月真正成为高产月。
    及时地运输焦煤，是当前的一个燃眉要务。焦煤运不出去，第一是高炉没有燃料，出不了铁；第二是煤矿采掘出来的煤没有地方放，影响正常生产。所以，铁路、公路、航运部门，必须拿出战斗的姿态来，像支援抗美援朝战争那样，支援钢铁战线上的斗争，千方百计地把一千零七十万吨钢所需要的焦煤提前运完。
    当前运输的主要问题有两个。一个叫做装卸力量不够，货物在车站、港口停留的时间太长。为了加速车辆和船只的周转速度，提高运输效率，必须依靠各地党委，发动群众，调集一切可能调集的人力，组织声势浩大的装卸大军，以蚂蚁搬泰山的气概，扭转车站、港口堵塞的局面。另一个叫做运输力量不足。要解决这个矛盾，除了动员一切可以动员的交通运输工具投入战斗以外，主要的办法就是把需要运输的物资排一排队，应按其轻重缓急，分别对待。凡是对钢铁和机械生产有关系的物资就先运，其它的后运。
    有人担心实行排队会打乱原来的运输秩序，会引起那些物资被排在后运的部门的叫喊。当然，按照新情况安排新的运输秩序，是一定要打乱旧的秩序的。“不破不立”，旧秩序不破，新秩序就建立不起来。在“破”和“立”的时候，“乱”一点是难免的。但是，这种“乱”并不值得担心。古语说的好：“乱而后能治，治而后能定”。意思是说，乱以后事物的矛盾才能充分暴露出来，人们才能更清楚、更全面地认识事物的发展规律，然后才可以订出有效的措施来。所以，我们不应害怕大跃进中的“乱”，主要的是在这种“乱”中摸索出一套革命的运输办法来。物资被安排后运的部门的叫喊也是很自然的。建设也好，运输也好，都要分清轻重缓急，区别对待，不能在同一时间内百废俱兴。“人有不为也，而后可以有为。”只有不运那些不该运的物资，或者把那些可以缓运的物资暂时缓一下，才有力量去运那些主要的、必须运的物资。
    为了及时地完成焦煤运输任务，必须坚决地消灭一切不合理的运输现象，减少人为的紧张。这要从两方面着手。一方面，有关部门要合理安排焦煤的调拨，消灭相向运输，尽可能地减少远程运输。另一方面，冶金部门必须解放思想，破除唯有焦炭才能炼铁的迷信。焦炭炼铁确有它的优越之处，这是不能否认的。但是，并非“只此一家，别无分店”。白煤（无烟煤）也可以炼铁，贵州省金沙县已经普遍地这样做了。现在的关键是破除迷信，解放思想，认真推广这些经验。我国焦煤的分布极不均匀，有矿石的地方不一定有焦煤，而只有白煤或其它品种的煤。推广不用焦炭炼铁的经验，不仅可以缓和焦煤的供应紧张情况，避免远程运输和相向运输，而且还可以充分就近利用资源，降低炼铁成本，这在经济上有着很大的意义。
    钢铁战线上的战斗已经进入最激烈的阶段。矿工们，交通运输工人们，为多产焦煤，早产焦煤，快运输焦煤，献出你们的大智大勇吧！
