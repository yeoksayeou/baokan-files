Premier Abbas's Letter to Chairman Mao

Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: Ferhat Abbas, Premier of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao Zedong on the 19th. The full text is as follows:

Your Excellency:

The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria satisfies the ardent wishes of the Algerian people. This is the inevitable result of an irresistible force of natural development, and the fruit of the Algerian people's sacrifice of more than 600,000 lives in four years of heroic struggle.

The decision to establish the Provisional Government of Algeria was made by the National Liberation Front's Guidance Executive Committee and the Algerian National Revolutionary Council. This decision conforms to the recommendations made at the meeting held in Tangier from April 27th to 30th, 1958, attended by the leaders of the three North African countries, and was agreed upon by the governments of Tunisia and Morocco. In addition, the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria is also a proper response to the French government, which is now planning to extend the referendum on the French Constitution of September 28, 1958, to Algeria, forcing the Algerian people to participate in a referendum that is entirely a matter of French constitutional issues. This is an intolerable provocation for a people who have been fighting for their independence for four years. The seriousness of this provocation can be measured if one can recall that when the referendum on the Constitution of the Fourth French Republic was held in 1946, the Algerian people were not called upon to participate in the vote.

The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria is a decisive factor in the peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue, which is hoped for by people all over the world. The establishment of this government will henceforth deprive the French government of the excuse it often uses to refuse any negotiations on the grounds that there is no effective negotiating counterpart.

The Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria is honored to send Your Excellency a memorandum of political and legal matters for your perusal – you are the master of the liberation of the Asian people and the tireless defender of the right to self-determination, which was solemnly affirmed by the Bandung Conference initiated by Your Excellency.

The terrible trials suffered by the Algerian people have always received the deepest sympathy from Your Excellency and the Chinese people, who also suffered from imperialist oppression in the past. In view of the great support of the glorious Chinese people for the Algerian revolutionary cause and the fact that the establishment of our government will be recorded in history as a decisive factor in the liberation of the suffering Algeria, I am convinced that the government of the People's Republic of China will be one of the first to recognize the Algerian government established at 13:00 on September 19, 1958. History will show that those who make this recognition have an outstanding political vision and a firm determination to defend world peace.

Your Excellency, please accept my deep respect on behalf of the Algerian people and government.

Ferhat Abbas

    阿巴斯总理给毛主席的信
    新华社22日讯　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理费尔哈特·阿巴斯19日写信给毛泽东主席，全文如下：阁下：
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立满足了阿尔及利亚人民的热切愿望，这是自然发展不可抗拒力量的必然结果，它是阿尔及利亚人民在四年的英勇斗争中牺牲了六十多万人的生命所取得的成果。
    成立阿尔及利亚临时政府是由民族解放阵线指导执行委员会和阿尔及利亚全国革命理事会所决定的。这一决定是符合于1958年4月27日至30日在丹吉尔举行的有北非三个国家的领袖参加的会议所提出的建议，并获得突尼斯，摩洛哥政府的同意。此外，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立也是对法国政府恰当的回答，法国政府现正拟把1958年9月28日关于法国宪法的公民投票扩大到阿尔及利亚的办法来推行其整体化的政策，强迫阿尔及利亚人民参加完全是法国宪法问题的公民投票。这对于四年来为争取他们的独立而斗争的人民说来，是一种不能容忍的挑衅。如果人们还能回忆起1946年关于法兰西第四共和国宪法的公民投票时，并未号召阿尔及利亚人民参加投票，就可以衡量这种挑衅的严重程度。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立是和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的决定性因素，而和平解决阿尔及利亚问题是全世界人民所祝望的。这一政府的成立将从此剥夺法国政府经常以所谓没有一个有效的谈判对象而拒绝任何谈判的借口。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府荣幸地把一份政治的和法律的备忘录送请阁下亮鉴——你是亚洲人民解放的巨匠，并且是人民自决权的不倦的保卫者，而人民自决权是阁下发起的万隆会议所庄严确认的。
    阿尔及利亚人民所遭受的恐怖的考验一直得到阁下和过去也曾饱尝帝国主义压迫的中国人民的最深切的同情。鉴于光荣的中国人民对阿尔及利亚革命事业的巨大支持以及我们政府的成立，将作为受苦难的阿尔及利亚的解放的一个决定性的因素记载在历史上，我确信中华人民共和国政府将是最先承认在1958年9月19日十三时成立的阿尔及利亚政府之一，历史将要表明，作出这种承认的人具有卓越的政治见解的和坚决保卫世界和平的决心。
    阁下，请接受我以阿尔及利亚人民和政府的名义向您所表示的深切的敬意。
                                      费尔哈特·阿巴斯
