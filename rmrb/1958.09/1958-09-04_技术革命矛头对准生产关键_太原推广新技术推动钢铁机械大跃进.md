    Technological Revolution Focuses on Key Production Areas
    Taiyuan Promotes New Technologies to Drive a Great Leap Forward in Steel and Machinery

    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 3rd dispatch) The steel and machinery industrial plants and mines in Taiyuan City have recently conscientiously summarized and promoted new suggestions and creations in the technological revolution movement to solve the current key production issues and promote a great leap forward in steel production.

    Currently, the mass movement of technological revolution is vigorously unfolding throughout the city because the technological revolution movement is closely integrated with current production. Many new technologies or technological reform "satellites" to increase output are constantly emerging, and many have already begun to be used in production. The electric furnace steelmaking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has recently launched two "satellites" in succession: one is the "mixed gas and oxygen steelmaking method" and the other is the "electric power triple steelmaking method." These suggestions and creations from the working masses have greatly shortened smelting time and increased steel production. The "mixed gas and oxygen steelmaking method" alone shortens the smelting time of each furnace of steel by one hour, and each furnace can increase the country's steel production by more than 3,000 tons per year. Workers in the thin plate department also created the "one-time rolling method" of rolling low-silicon steel three sheets without reheating, which increased the output of silicon steel sheets by more than 20% and ensured the quality of the silicon steel sheets. Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, Jinxi Machinery Plant, and the joint state-private Five-One Machinery Plant are also carrying out technological revolution movements around ensuring the needs of metallurgy and power generation equipment, mobilizing workers to reform tools and improve equipment. Many repair workshops also use the method of "ants gnawing bones" to manufacture large-scale equipment. Under the slogan of "small machines doing big jobs," the machine repair workshop of Jinxi Machinery Plant is trial-producing seamless steel pipes, 1,500-kilowatt generators, and simple boring machines. The workers in the copper casting section of the Five-One Machinery Plant boldly reformed equipment and created an automatic copper smelting furnace, which accelerated copper output time and increased production efficiency by eleven times, providing a guarantee for the completion of the task of producing more than 1,000 tons of copper in the fourth quarter of this year.

    At the same time, many factories have also generally summarized existing technological innovation suggestions and inventions and quickly applied them to current production. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, which created the "three-groove steel tapping method," recently examined the reasons why the open-hearth steelmaking department had not completed its production plan, summarized the lessons learned from not promoting the "three-groove steel tapping method," and decided to promote it immediately. No. 1 furnace has already begun to use this new technology, which has shortened the smelting time by one hour and increased output sharply by 100%. The new technology of rapid molding created by young workers in the cast iron workshop of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant has also been carefully studied at the recent technical meeting of the entire workshop and is being prepared for promotion. Now, many factories and mines have also put forward measures to closely integrate the technological revolution movement with current production, preparing to carry out experimental research on new technologies and have a large number of technicians go deep into the workshops, etc., to produce and research with workers, so that technological innovation suggestions and creations can be quickly applied to production.

　　技术革命矛头对准生产关键
    太原推广新技术推动钢铁机械大跃进
    本报太原3日电　太原市各钢铁和机械工业厂矿，最近认真总结和推广技术革命运动中的新建议和新创造，来解决当前生产中的关键，推动钢铁工业生产大跃进。
    目前，由于技术革命运动同当前生产紧密地结合起来，技术革命的群众运动正在全市蓬勃展开。许多提高产量的新技术或新的技术改革的“卫星”，不断出现，而且有不少已开始用到生产上。太原钢铁厂的电炉炼钢部最近几天就连续放出了两颗“卫星”，一个是“煤气、氧气混合炼钢法”，一个是“电力三连炼钢法”。这些来自工人群众当中的建议和创造，大大缩短了冶炼时间，增加了钢的产量。仅“煤气、氧气混合炼钢法”就使每炉钢的冶炼时间缩短了一个小时，一个炉子每年可为国家增产三千多吨钢。薄板部的工人，还创造了低矽钢三张轧制不回炉的“一次轧成法”，使矽钢片的产量提高了20％以上，而且保证了矽钢片的质量。太原重型机器厂、太原矿山机器厂、晋西机器厂以及公私合营的五一机器厂，也都围绕保证冶金、发电设备需要，开展技术革命运动，发动工人改革工具、改进设备。许多修理车间也用蚂蚁啃骨头的办法制造大型设备。晋西机器厂的机修车间，在“小机器做大活”的口号下，正在试制无缝钢管、一千五百瓩发电机和简易搪床等设备。五一机器厂铸铜工段工人们，大胆改革设备，并创造了自动炼铜炉，加快了出铜时间，提高了生产效率十一倍，给今年第四季度生产紫铜一千多吨任务的完成，提供了保证条件。
    同时，不少工厂还普遍总结了已有的技术革新建议和发明创造，并迅速用到当前生产当中。创造“三槽出钢法”的太原钢铁厂最近检查了平炉炼钢部没有完成生产计划的原因，总结了没有推广“三槽出钢法”的教训，决定马上推广。一号炉已开始采用了这项新技术，冶炼时间缩短了一小时，产量猛增一倍。太原重型机器厂铸铁车间青年工人创造的快速造型的新技术，最近也在全车间技术会上认真进行了研究，准备推广。现在，许多厂矿还提出了把技术革命运动同当前生产紧密结合的措施，准备开展新技术的试验研究，和大批技术人员深入车间等办法，与工人同生产、同研究，使技术革新的建议和创造迅速运用到生产当中。　（郭洁）
