Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 2nd: The "Al-Ahram" newspaper today published a dispatch from New York stating that the British and American governments have signed new arms agreements with the Israeli government.

According to reports, Britain will supply Israel with arms worth 30 million to 50 million pounds under these agreements. The United States will supply Israel with arms worth 40 million to 50 million dollars. The newspaper said that these estimates indicate that the weapons agreed upon for supply could not be the "defensive" weapons mentioned by US State Department officials, nor could they be limited to anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank guns. These figures indicate that they are offensive weapons.

The newspaper said that the supply of new weapons to Israel by Britain and the United States was decided by Dulles and Macmillan during their talks at the so-called Baghdad Pact Council meeting held in London a month ago. Since then, Israel has immediately begun talks with Britain and the United States, and Israel has submitted a list of the military arms it requires to the two countries.

"Al-Ahram" also published an editorial stating that the purpose of Britain and the United States in providing Israel with large quantities of military arms is to instigate Israel to carry out aggression and provoke war.

The newspaper pointed out that just as Hammarskjöld came to the Middle East to arrange the withdrawal of American and British troops from the Middle East in accordance with the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, the act of the United States and Britain transporting large quantities of military arms to Israel is playing with fire in the Middle East once again.

### 为在中东的新侵略埋下火种  美英供应以色列大批军火

    为在中东的新侵略埋下火种
　　美英供应以色列大批军火
    新华社开罗2日电　“金字塔报”今天刊载从纽约发回的一则消息说，英美已经同以色列政府签订了新的军火协定。
    据报道，根据这些协定，英国供应以色列的军火价值三千万到五千万英镑。美国供应以色列的军火价值四千万到五千万美元。报纸说，这些估计表明，商定供应的武器不可能是美国国务院人士所说的那种“防御”性武器，也不可能仅仅限于高射炮和反坦克炮。这些数字表明，它们是进攻性的武器。
    这家报纸说，英美对以色列供应新武器，是在一个月以前在伦敦举行的所谓巴格达条约理事会会议期间杜勒斯同麦克米伦在会谈中决定的。那时以后，以色列同英国和美国马上开始进行会谈，以色列向英美两国提出了它所要求的军火清单。
    “金字塔报”同时发表社论说，英美把大量军火供给以色列，目的是要唆使以色列进行侵略和挑起战争。
    这家报纸指出，正当哈马舍尔德到中东来应该根据联合国大会的决议安排美英军队从中东撤退的时候，美英把大批军火运到以色列的行为是再次在中东玩火。
