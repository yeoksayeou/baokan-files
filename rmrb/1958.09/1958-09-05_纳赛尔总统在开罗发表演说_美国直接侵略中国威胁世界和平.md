Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 3rd: President Nasser of the United Arab Republic condemned the United States today for occupying China's Taiwan and threatening world peace. He also condemned the US and Britain for delaying the withdrawal of their troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and demanded the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops.

Speaking at the first meeting of the Arab United States Committee, President Nasser pointed out that the United States' current military provocation against China is direct aggression. He said that when we announced our principles on the "Voice of the Arabs" radio – principles that comply with the UN Charter – they said it was "indirect aggression." But when their troops occupy Taiwan, which we all know is part of China, when the Chinese people want to realize their aspirations and retain all their territory, imperialist military intervention occurs. He emphasized that the real intervention is: Taiwan is occupied. This is the real intervention that threatens world peace.

Nasser said that our country has recognized China because we understand geography and we know that China is China. He said that the whole world knows that China is now moving forward, but some people ignore the more than 600 million Chinese people. But how can we ignore the facts, how can we ignore reality, how can we recognize occupied Taiwan as representing China, and ignore China – the real China – which is working hard to develop itself to improve the people's living standards! Therefore, we recognized China.

Nasser continued, "Today we see that fighting is taking place in that region of the world due to the United States' decision to intervene and use Chiang Kai-shek against the Chinese people, thereby threatening world peace. This is what we call intervention, this is what we call direct aggression."

Referring to the US and British attempts to undermine the UN General Assembly resolution and delay the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon and Jordan, Nasser said that we are ready and waiting. We demand that the occupying forces immediately withdraw from Lebanon, Jordan and Aden, and that Algeria be liberated. He said that the Arab people are determined to realize these guarantees and fight for them.

Nasser said that aggression against Lebanon, Jordan, Aden and Algeria is aggression against all Arab people. He said that we are all against imperialism and its agents.

Referring to the fact that imperialism incited Israel to invade Arab countries, Nasser said that history is repeating itself today. In 1956, the imperialist countries thought that the opportunity had come to destroy Arab nationalism through Israeli aggression, and now they are supplying Israel with weapons to achieve the same goal. But he pointed out that the Arab people will once again defeat all attempts by imperialism to obstruct their victorious march towards Arab unity.

In his speech, Nasser also praised the Iraqi revolution and condemned the aggressive Baghdad Pact.

Yemeni Crown Prince Badr also participated in chairing the meeting. All twelve members of the Arab United States Committee attended the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 3rd: Cairo's "Al Misaa" published a commentary on the 3rd, saying that the people of the world, including the American people, seek peace and oppose the United States helping the adventures of agents like Chiang Kai-shek.

The commentary said, "Despite the American fleet and infantry, Kinmen and Matsu will surely be liberated."

Another article published in "Al Misaa" on the 3rd, entitled "The Truth Behind the Situation in Kinmen and Matsu," pointed out that in the Chinese people's struggle for the liberation of Taiwan, all peace-loving countries and governments stand on the side of justice, on the side of the government of the People's Republic of China. "They believe that once the Seventh Fleet is driven away... it means eliminating the tension in the Far East and the greatest source of aggression."

After criticizing the United States for instigating the Chiang Kai-shek clique to carry out military provocations against China, the article said that in order to stop American imperialism from carrying out aggression, endangering world peace and peace-loving countries, it is necessary for China to take resolute measures against American policies and American puppets in the Far East.

    纳赛尔总统在开罗发表演说
　　美国直接侵略中国威胁世界和平
    新华社开罗3日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔今天谴责美国侵占中国的台湾，威胁世界和平。他还谴责美英拖延从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出它们的军队，并且要求美英军队立即撤走。
    纳赛尔总统在阿拉伯联合邦委员会的第一次会议上发表演说时指出，美国目前对中国的军事挑衅是直接侵略。他说，当我们在“阿拉伯之声”电台中宣布我们的原则——那些符合联合国宪章的原则——时，他们说，这是“间接侵略”。但是当他们的军队占领我们大家知道是中国一部分的台湾时，当中国人民要实现他们的愿望和保有他们的全部领土时，就发生了帝国主义的军事干涉。他强调指出，真正的干涉是：台湾遭到占领。这是威胁世界和平的真正的干涉。
    纳赛尔说，我国已经承认中国，因为我们懂得地理，而且我们知道中国是中国。他说，全世界都知道，中国现在正在向前迈进，而有人却无视六亿多中国人民。但是，我们怎么能够无视事实，我们怎么能够忽视现实，我们怎么能够承认被占领的台湾代表中国，而无视中国——正在努力发展自己以提高人民生活水平的真正的中国呢！因此，我们承认了中国。
    纳赛尔接着说，“今天我们看到，由于美国决定进行干涉和使蒋介石反对中国人民，世界的那个地区正在发生战斗，从而威胁了世界和平。这就是我们所说的干涉，这就是我们所说的直接侵略。”
    纳赛尔在谈到美英企图破坏联合国大会决议，拖延从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军时说，我们已经枕戈以待。我们要求占领军立即撤离黎巴嫩、约旦和亚丁，并且让阿尔及利亚得到解放。他说，阿拉伯人民决心实现这些保证并且为它进行斗争。
    纳赛尔说，侵略黎巴嫩、约旦、亚丁和阿尔及利亚就是侵略所有的阿拉伯人民。他说，我们大家都反对帝国主义和它的代理人。
    纳赛尔在谈到帝国主义唆使以色列来侵略阿拉伯国家时说，今天历史正在重演，帝国主义国家在1956年曾经以为通过以色列侵略来摧毁阿拉伯民族主义的机会已经来到，现在它们又在供应以色列武器来达到同样的目的。但是他指出，阿拉伯人民将再一次击败帝国主义企图阻挠他们向阿拉伯大团结胜利进军的一切尝试。
    纳赛尔在演说中还赞扬了伊拉克革命和谴责了侵略性的巴格达条约。
    也门王太子巴德尔也参加主持了这个会议。阿拉伯联合邦委员会的十二名委员都出席了会议。
    新华社开罗3日电　开罗“晚报”3日发表评论说，全世界人民包括美国人民在内都寻求和平，反对美国帮助像蒋介石之流的代理人的冒险。
    评论说，“尽管有美国的舰队和步兵，金门和马祖必将获得解放。”
    “晚报”在3日发表的另一篇题为“金门和马祖局势后面的真相”的文章指出，在中国人民为解放台湾而进行的斗争中，一切爱好和平的国家和政府都站在正义方面，站在中华人民共和国政府方面。“它们相信，一旦赶走第七舰队……就意味着消除了远东的紧张局势和侵略的最大根源”。
    文章指责美国指使蒋介石集团对中国进行军事挑衅的行动以后说，为了制止美帝国主义进行侵略，危害世界和平和爱好和平的国家，中国有必要对美国政策和美国在远东的傀儡采取坚决的措施。
