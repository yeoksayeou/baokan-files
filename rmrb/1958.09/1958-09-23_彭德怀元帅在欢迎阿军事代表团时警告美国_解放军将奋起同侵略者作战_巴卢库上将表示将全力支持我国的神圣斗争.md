Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd – At the invitation of Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense of our country, Marshal Peng Dehuai, the Albanian military delegation of eight people, led by First Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of National Defense, General Baluku, arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon for a visit to our country.

As General Baluku stepped off the plane, he was warmly welcomed by Marshal Peng Dehuai, Marshal Nie Rongzhen, and senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. General Baluku, accompanied by Marshal Peng Dehuai, reviewed the guard of honor.

In his written welcoming speech, Marshal Peng Dehuai first expressed warm welcome on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the delegation of comrades-in-arms from the heroic Albanian People's Army, from the outpost of the Adriatic Sea in the socialist camp.

Marshal Peng Dehuai emphasized that US imperialism has always been hostile to the people of our country and has long occupied our country's territory of Taiwan; recently, it has concentrated a large number of troops in the Taiwan Strait area and has repeatedly invaded our territorial waters and airspace, disregarding our warnings. This crime has aroused the boundless anger of the Chinese people and all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Our officers and soldiers fully support the statements issued by Premier Zhou on September 6th and Foreign Minister Chen Yi on September 20th. The firm position of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands is unshakable, and the Chinese people have every right to recover their territory at an appropriate time and in an appropriate manner. If US imperialism does not wake up in time, immediately ceases its military provocations in the Taiwan Strait, and dares to impose war on the people of our country, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will rise up and fight against US imperialism, just as they resisted the Japanese warlords in the past.

In his written speech, General Baluku said that we have come to your great and beautiful country to understand the tremendous achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people in building socialism and to understand the work and lives of the brave soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We believe that the visit of the Albanian military delegation will help strengthen the fraternal ties between the people and armed forces of our two countries.

General Baluku severely condemned the traitorous behavior of Yugoslavia. He said that the unity and friendship between the people of Albania and China under the brilliant banner of Marxism-Leninism has been further strengthened and tested in the struggle to consolidate the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp and to oppose the aggressive attacks of US imperialism and its servant, the Yugoslav traitor. The shameful aim of the Yugoslav traitors has been and will always be bankrupt in the face of the rock-solid unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

General Baluku pointed out that the military provocations, military adventures, and saber-rattling of US imperialism cannot intimidate anyone, let alone the great Chinese people who are fighting for the liberation of their inseparable and legitimate territorial part – Taiwan. If they dare to extend their sinister hands to invade the People's Republic of China, they will surely lose their heads on this criminal and hopeless road.

General Baluku, on behalf of the Albanian people and their armed forces, expressed respect to the great 600 million Chinese people and their armed forces, and expressed that they will give fraternal and strong support to the sacred struggle of the Chinese people to liberate their territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands.

Among those who came to the airport to welcome the distinguished guests today were Senior General Huang Kecheng, General Xiao Hua, General Zhang Zongxun, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong and other senior generals, as well as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei.

Albanian Ambassador to China, Balili, and military attachés of various countries to China also went to the airport to welcome them.

    彭德怀元帅在欢迎阿军事代表团时警告美国
    解放军将奋起同侵略者作战
    巴卢库上将表示将全力支持我国的神圣斗争
    新华社22日讯　应我国国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀元帅邀请来我国访问的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团一行八人，在部长会议第一副主席兼国防部长巴卢库上将率领下，今天下午乘飞机到达北京。
    巴卢库上将走下飞机时，受到彭德怀元帅、聂荣臻元帅和中国人民解放军高级将领的热情欢迎。巴卢库上将在彭德怀元帅陪同下检阅了仪仗队。
    彭德怀元帅在书面的欢迎词中，首先代表中国人民解放军全体官兵对来自社会主义阵营亚德里亚海前哨的、英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民军战友的代表团表示热烈的欢迎。
    彭德怀元帅强调指出，美帝国主义一向敌视我国人民，长期侵占我国领土台湾；最近，更在台湾海峡地区集结了大量兵力，并且不顾我方警告，多次侵入我国领海领空。这种罪行，激起了中国人民和中国人民解放军全体官兵的无比愤怒。我军官兵完全拥护周总理9月6日和陈毅外长9月20日所发表的声明，中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的坚定立场是不可动摇的，中国人民完全有权利在适当的时机，用适当的方法收复自己的领土。如果美帝国主义不及时清醒过来，立即停止其在台湾海峡的军事挑衅，胆敢把战争强加在我国人民头上，中国人民和中国人民解放军，将和过去反抗日本军阀一样，奋起与美帝国主义作战。
    巴卢库上将书面致词说，我们来到你们伟大而美丽的国家，是为了了解兄弟般的中国人民在建设社会主义事业中所取得的巨大的成就，了解中国人民解放军的勇敢的战士们的工作和生活。我们相信，阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团的访问，将有助于加强我们两国人民和武装力量之间的兄弟般的联系。
    巴卢库上将严厉谴责南斯拉夫的叛徒行为。他说，阿中两国人民在马列主义光辉旗帜下的团结友谊，在为巩固社会主义阵营的牢不可破的团结以及反对美帝国主义侵略性的进攻和它的奴仆南斯拉夫叛徒的斗争中，更加牢固了，并经受了考验。南斯拉夫叛徒的可耻目的，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚如磐石般的团结面前，已经并且将永远遭到破产。
    巴卢库上将指出，美帝国主义的军事挑衅、军事冒险和玩弄武器，恫吓不了任何人，更恫吓不了在为解放自己的不可分割的合法的领土部分——台湾的伟大的中国人民。如果他们胆敢伸出罪恶之手侵略中华人民共和国，那么他们必将在这一罪恶的毫无出路的道路上丢掉脑袋。
    巴卢库上将代表阿尔巴尼亚人民及其武装部队向伟大的六亿中国人民及其武装力量表示敬意。并表示将对中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿的神圣斗争，给予兄弟般的有力的支持。
    今天到机场欢迎贵宾的，有黄克诚大将、萧华上将、张宗逊上将、萧向荣中将等高级将领，还有外交部副部长姬鹏飞。
    阿尔巴尼亚驻我国大使巴利里和各国驻华武官也到机场欢迎。
