　　People's Commune is Good
　　Xiāo Sān
　　The people's commune is good,
　　The road to happiness is higher than the sky,
　　Production targets leap forward even more,
　　Millions of satellites will be thrown into the sky!
　　The people's commune is good,
　　Many people, united hearts, and heroic spirit,
　　The land is connected into a large area,
　　Iron oxen and iron horses can run all over the ground.
　　The people's commune is good,
　　Everyone contributes treasures,
　　Roller bearings are just the beginning,
　　Machinery, electricity, chemical fertilizers, cement...
　　Ah, so many light and heavy industries to be developed on a large scale!
　　The people's commune is good,
　　The cultural revolution is rising to a climax,
　　Members are drilling into technology and tackling science,
　　Self-run red and expert universities, middle schools, and primary schools.
　　The people's commune is good,
　　Universal military service ensures safety,
　　Usually, they march into the natural world with fierce battles,
　　When the enemy comes, resolutely and thoroughly wipe him out.
　　The people's commune is beautiful,
　　Everyone is active,
　　Everyone becomes a versatile person,
　　Workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers become one.
　　The people's commune is happy,
　　The young are cared for, and the old are at peace,
　　Children all go to nurseries,
　　The elderly live in homes of happiness.
　　The people's commune is strong,
　　Women are liberated again,
　　Small families become generous,
　　The food in the commune's canteen is especially fragrant.
　　The people's commune is joyful,
　　Collective life is the happiest,
　　The communist atmosphere is new,
　　I am for everyone, and everyone is for me.
　　The people's commune is good,
　　Every household is illuminated by electric lights,
　　Postal and telecommunications, transportation, hygiene, culture, and entertainment are all developed,
　　May I ask, in the countryside, what is not as good as in the city?
　　The people's commune is good,
　　Everyone has rich knowledge and a good body,
　　Physical labor becomes a pleasure,
　　And mental labor combined with practice is even more wonderful.
　　The commune is good! The commune is good!
　　Everyone beats gongs and drums and sets off firecrackers,
　　Celebrating the commune movement reaching a climax,
　　The ideals of philosophers for thousands of years will soon be realized,
　　How many revolutionary martyrs shed their blood and threw away their heads,
　　In exchange for today's red flags flying everywhere,
　　In exchange for joyful songs reaching the skies,
　　Socialist construction is accelerated and made better,
　　The transition to communism can arrive sooner,
　　The commune system is good!
　　Communism is good!
