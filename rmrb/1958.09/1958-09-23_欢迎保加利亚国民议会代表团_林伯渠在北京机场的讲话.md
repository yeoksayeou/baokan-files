Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd. The full text of Vice Chairman Lin Boqu's speech at Beijing Airport welcoming the Bulgarian National Assembly Delegation is as follows:

    Dear Comrade Vulko Chervenkov, dear Comrade Georgi Kostov, dear comrades of the entire delegation:

    Today, we are welcoming with great joy the envoys of the fraternal Bulgarian people who have come from afar—the Bulgarian National Assembly Delegation headed by Comrade Chervenkov and the Sofia City People's Council Delegation headed by Comrade Kostov. First of all, please allow to me, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese people, to express a warm welcome to the distinguished guests, and through you to extend our lofty respect to the Bulgarian people.

    Although China and Bulgaria are geographically far apart, the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism and the common cause of building socialism have linked us together like brothers. In recent years, the friendly cooperation between our two countries in political, economic, cultural, and other fields has greatly developed, and delegations from both countries have been dispatched many times to conduct friendly visits with each other. In January last year, the delegation of the National People's Congress of our country visited Bulgaria and received a warm welcome and cordial hospitality from the Bulgarian people. Around this time last year, the Bulgarian government delegation headed by Comrade Yugov visited our country, leaving a deep impression on the Chinese people. Now, we have the opportunity to welcome the Bulgarian National Assembly Delegation and the Sofia City People's Council Delegation to visit our country, and we are very happy. These mutual friendly visits between our two countries' parliaments, governments, and peoples not only further consolidate and develop the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Bulgaria, but also help to strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and safeguard the noble cause of world peace.

    Dear distinguished guests, please allow us to once again express our warm welcome to you.

    Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian peoples!

    Long live the People's Republic of Bulgaria!

    欢迎保加利亚国民议会代表团
    林伯渠在北京机场的讲话
    新华社22日讯　林伯渠副委员长在北京机场欢迎保加利亚国民议会代表团的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的伏尔科·契尔文科夫同志，亲爱的格奥尔基·科斯托夫同志，亲爱的代表团全体同志们：
    今天，我们怀着十分愉快的心情，迎接不远万里而来的兄弟的保加利亚人民的使者——以契尔文科夫同志为首的保加利亚国民议会代表团和以科斯托夫同志为首的索非亚市人民会议代表团。首先，请允许我代表中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中国人民向贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎，并且通过你们向保加利亚人民致以崇高的敬意。
    中保两国在地理上虽然相距很远，但是马克思列宁主义的共同思想和建设社会主义的共同事业把我们像兄弟一样联结起来。我们两国之间的政治、经济、文化等各方面的友好合作近年来有了很大的发展，两国间曾经多次派遣代表团相互进行友好访问。去年一月，我国全国人民代表大会代表团访问了保加利亚，受到保加利亚人民的热烈欢迎和亲切款待。去年这个时候，以于哥夫同志为首的保加利亚政府代表团访问了我国，给中国人民留下了深刻的印象。现在，我们又有机会欢迎保加利亚国民议会代表团和索非亚市人民会议代表团前来我国访问，我们感到非常高兴。我们两国议会、政府和人民之间的这种相互友好访问，不仅进一步巩固和发展了中保两国间的友好合作关系，并且有利于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结和维护世界和平的崇高事业。
    亲爱的贵宾们，请允许我们再一次向你们表示热烈的欢迎。
    中保两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
    保加利亚人民共和国万岁！
