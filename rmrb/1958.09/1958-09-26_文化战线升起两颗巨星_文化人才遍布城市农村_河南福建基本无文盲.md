Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 25th: Henan Province announced on the 25th that it has basically become an illiterate-free province. This year, the province eliminated illiteracy for 8.56 million people, more than four times the total number in the past eight years. As of the 20th, 94.2% of young and middle-aged people aged 14 to 40 in more than 120 counties and cities across the province have shaken off illiteracy, and in more than 20 counties and cities, the scope of people who have eliminated illiteracy has been expanded to 45 or 50 years old. Those who have graduated from literacy classes generally know 1,500 to 3,000 characters, can read popular reading materials, and can write articles of 300 to 500 characters. More than 8.3 million people who have eliminated illiteracy in the province have entered spare-time red and expert universities to continue their studies. Every people's commune has formed an education network from primary school to university.

One of the characteristics of Henan Province's literacy work is that the whole Party is involved in literacy, the whole people are involved in literacy, and it is always carried out in conjunction with production and central work. For example, in the intense water conservancy movement, tens of thousands of spare-time cultural schools were moved to construction sites, learning followed tasks, content followed production, teachers followed students, teaching whenever there was time, learning whenever there was time; and adapting to various production characteristics, a wide range of in-depth and diverse forms of contracted teaching were adopted.

A second characteristic is that the poorer and more ignorant areas have become the banner of the cultural revolution. For example, in Shipowan, a small village in the Qinling Mountains, there was only one farmer who had studied for eight days. He went to the primary school eighteen miles away down the mountain every day to study, and then returned to the village to teach everyone to read, day after day for six years. This village finally became the first illiterate-free village in the county.

A third characteristic is that literacy is eliminated the busier you are. Three literacy upsurges in the province were formed during the water conservancy movement, the summer harvest, and autumn field management.

A fourth characteristic is that one class graduates and another is promoted, one group graduates and another is promoted, and new and higher requirements are immediately put forward after completing literacy learning.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 25th: After ten months of diligent study and hard work by the masses, Fujian Province has basically become an illiterate-free province. As of mid-September, a total of 4,798,800 young and middle-aged illiterate people have been eliminated in the province, accounting for 91% of the total number of young and middle-aged illiterate people.

Since last winter and this spring, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a great leap forward situation has also emerged in literacy work in Fujian Province. Various localities have adopted a variety of methods to meet the needs of production and the requirements of the masses, so that where people go, cultural learning goes, setting off a wave of teaching and learning by the whole people, which has rapidly promoted the literacy movement.

During this period, more than 92% of young and middle-aged illiterate people in the province participated in learning, which is more than five times that of the same period last year.

The elimination of illiteracy has played a great role in enlivening rural life and promoting the cultural revolution and the technical revolution. A large number of worker-peasant inventors, agricultural experts, and literary and artistic creators have emerged throughout the province. In Pinghe, Yunxiao, Jinjiang and other rural areas, more than 90% of young people can create poetry. After literacy was eliminated in Gutian County, a remote mountainous area, more than 4,700 agricultural social accountants and work recorders, and more than 25,000 cultural cadres and civil school teachers were trained. All agricultural cooperatives have the cultural talents they need. At present, there are more than 33,000 spare-time middle and primary schools, more than 28,000 spare-time technical night schools and red and expert schools, more than 3,000 spare-time universities, and more than 2,300 research institutes, mainly in townships and communes, and a new type of education network has been formed in rural areas.

### 文化战线升起两颗巨星  文化人才遍布城市农村  河南福建基本无文盲

    文化战线升起两颗巨星
    文化人才遍布城市农村
    河南福建基本无文盲
    据新华社郑州25日电  河南省在25日宣布已经基本成为无文盲省。全省今年扫除文盲八百五十六万人，等于过去八年扫盲总和的四倍多。到20日止，全省一百二十多个县市，从十四岁到四十岁的青壮年中已有94.2％摆脱了文盲状态，并有二十多个县市脱盲群众的范围已扩大到四十五岁或五十岁。扫盲毕业的群众一般都能识一千五百到三千字，能读通俗读物，能写三五百字的文章。全省已有八百三十多万脱盲群众进入业余红专大学继续学习。每个人民公社都已形成了从小学到大学的教育网。
    河南省扫盲工作的特点之一，是全党抓扫盲，全民都扫盲，并且始终结合生产和中心工作进行。例如在紧张的水利化运动中，就有数以万计的业余文化学校搬到工地，学习跟着任务走，内容跟着生产走，教员跟着学生走，有空就教，有空就学；并且适应各种生产特点，采取了广泛深入的多种多样的包教形式。
    特点之二，是越穷越白的地区反成了文化革命的旗帜。例如秦岭山上的小村石坡湾，只有一个读过八天书的农民。他每天到山下十八里外的小学学习，再回村教大家识字，六年如一日。这个村终于成为本县第一个无文盲村。
    特点之三，是越忙越扫盲。全省三次扫盲高潮，是在水利化运动、夏季大丰收和秋田管理期间形成的。
    特点之四，是毕业一班升一班，毕业一组升一组，完成扫盲学习后马上提出新的更高的要求。
    据新华社福州25日电  经过广大群众的十个月勤学苦练，福建省已基本上成为无文盲省。到9月中旬止全省共已扫除青壮年文盲四百七十九万八千多人，占青壮年文盲总数91％。
    去冬今春以来，随着工农业生产的大跃进，福建省扫盲工作也出现了大跃进形势。各地采用适应生产需要和群众要求的多种多样的方法，作到人到哪里，文化学习到哪里，掀起了全民教、全民学的热潮，使扫盲运动迅速向前推进。
    这一期间，全省青壮年文盲中有92％以上都参加了学习，等于去年同期的五倍多。
    文盲的扫除，对活跃农村生活，促进文化革命、技术革命起了很大作用。全省各地涌现出了大批工农发明家、农业土专家和文艺创作家。平和、云霄、晋江等地农村中90％以上的青年都会创作诗歌。偏僻山区古田县扫盲后培养了四千七百多个农业社会计、记工员，二万五千多个文化干部和民校教师，各农业社所需要的有文化的人才全都有了。目前各地以乡、社为主，创办了业余中、小学三万三千多所，业余技术夜校和红专学校二万八千多所，业余大学三千多所，研究所二千三百多所，农村中一套新型的教育网已经形成。
