Xinhua News Agency, Guanghua, September 1st (Xinhua News Agency reporter Tian Zhuang) reports: Today, in the valley near Danjiangkou on the upper reaches of the Han River, explosions roared continuously, rocks flew, and dust filled the air. The massive Danjiangkou Water Control Project officially started construction ahead of schedule.

The Danjiangkou Water Control Project is the key project for controlling and developing the Han River. According to the design, the entire project includes: a dam, auxiliary dams on both banks, a power station building, navigation facilities, a main water diversion canal, and canal structures. The dam is 110 meters high, equivalent to a 28-story skyscraper, and will be built from more than 2.7 million cubic meters of concrete. It is one of the largest high dams in China today. The total length of the dam and auxiliary dams is 3,062 meters, and the width of the dam top is 25 meters. The highway bridge on top is 8 to 10 meters wide, allowing two cars to drive side by side. Upstream of this massive structure is a large reservoir with an area of more than 1,000 square kilometers. Once this large reservoir is completed, the Han River from Danjiangkou to Wuhan will be able to avoid floods that occur once a century. The 12 million mu of farmland in the Tangbai River basin on the left bank of the Han River, belonging to Henan and Hubei provinces, can receive 3 to 6 billion cubic meters of water for irrigation annually. Together with the water from the Tangbai River itself, the irrigation area can be expanded to more than 15 million mu. In terms of power generation, the installed capacity is 900,000 kilowatts, and the annual power generation can reach 4.7 billion kilowatt-hours. After the regulation of the reservoir, navigation conditions will also be greatly improved. In addition, the future main canal for diverting the Han River to the Yellow River will not only solve the water shortage problem in North and Huai North China, but also open up a north-south grand canal by utilizing the main water diversion canal, thereby connecting China's famous four major rivers—the Yangtze River, the Huai River, the Yellow River, and the Han River.

To ensure the smooth construction of this great project, the state will allocate huge quantities of cement, steel, wood, etc. Among them, cement alone amounts to more than 450,000 tons, and steel exceeds 50,000 tons. In addition, during the construction period, railways need to be built, bridges need to be erected, and various auxiliary enterprise construction projects also need to be undertaken. Therefore, in terms of its construction scale and technical complexity, it can be compared with the Sanmenxia Water Control Project on the Yellow River, which is currently under construction.

Such a large-scale and complex water control project usually requires a relatively long period of construction preparation. However, thanks to the great encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction and with the active support of various relevant departments, all the staff of the Danjiangkou Engineering Bureau broke historical conventions with a revolutionary spirit and started construction ahead of schedule after only a little more than a month of preparation. The person in charge of the engineering bureau told reporters that the entire project construction method will adopt a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, from manual to semi-mechanized and mechanized. Even so, the Danjiangkou Water Control Project will still be completed in about three years, at a speed rarely seen in the world.

The early commencement of the Danjiangkou Water Control Project is largely attributed to the early completion of the preliminary and technical designs. This design was compiled entirely by our country's designers with the assistance of Soviet experts. Today, the builders of the Danjiangkou Water Control Project held a grand commencement ceremony on the hillside on the right bank of the surging river. They presented resolution letters to the conference, guaranteeing to overcome all difficulties and strive for early completion.

### 苦战三年  根治汉水  丹江口水利枢纽工程动工

　　苦战三年  根治汉水
　　丹江口水利枢纽工程动工
    据新华社光化1日电　新华社记者田庄报道：今天，汉水上游丹江口附近的峡谷里，连续响起了爆炸的轰鸣，岩石碎片飞舞，烟尘弥漫，规模巨大的丹江口水利枢纽工程，提前正式动工兴建了。
    丹江口水利枢纽是根治和开发汉水的关键工程。根据设计，整个工程包括：拦河大坝、两岸副坝、电站厂房、通航设施、引水总干渠和渠道建筑物等。拦河大坝高度达一百一十公尺，相当于二十八层摩天大楼，将由二百七十多万方混凝土筑成，它是我国现时最大高坝之一。大坝和副坝的总长度是三千零六十二公尺，坝顶宽二十五公尺，上面的公路桥宽八公尺到十公尺，可以并排走两部汽车。在这个巨大的建筑物的上游；是一个面积达一千多平方公里的大水库。这座大水库修好以后，汉水自丹江口以下一直到武汉，可以免除百年一遇的洪水灾害；汉水左岸唐白河流域属于河南、湖北两省的一千二百万亩农田，每年可以得到三十到六十亿公方的水量灌溉，加上唐白河本身的水，可使灌溉区扩大到一千五百多万亩。在发电方面，装机容量九十万瓩，每年可以发电四十七亿度。经过水库的调节，航运条件也将大为改善。此外，将来通过引汉济黄（河）总干渠，不仅解决华北、淮北地区的缺水问题，还可以利用引水总干渠开辟南北大运河，从而使我国著名的四大河流——长江、淮河、黄河、汉水贯通起来。
    为了保证这一伟大工程顺利施工，国家将调拨数量巨大的水泥、钢材、木材等；其中仅水泥就有四十五万多吨，钢材也在五万吨以上。另外，在施工期间，这里还需修筑铁路、架设桥梁，以及各种附属企业的工程建筑。因此，从它的建设规模和技术复杂来看，都可以同目前正在施工中的黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程相比美。
    这样大规模而又复杂的水利工程，在通常的情况下，需要作比较长时间的施工准备工作。可是，丹江口工程局的全体职工们，由于党的建设社会主义总路线的极大鼓舞，同时在各有关部门的积极支援下，仅仅经过一个多月时间的准备以后，便以革命精神打破历史陈规，提前施工。工程局负责人对记者说，整个工程施工方法，将采取由土到洋，土洋结合，由手工式到半机械化、机械化。即使这样，丹江口水利枢纽工程，仍将以世界上罕见的高速度在大约三年左右的时间内建成。
    丹江口水利枢纽工程能够提前动工，初步设计和技术设计的提前完成是重要关键。这个设计是在苏联专家的帮助下，完全由我国设计人员编制的。丹江口水利枢纽工程的建设者们，今天在滔滔江水右岸的山头上举行了隆重的开工典礼。他们向大会献了一份又一份的决心书，保证战胜一切困难，争取早日完工。
