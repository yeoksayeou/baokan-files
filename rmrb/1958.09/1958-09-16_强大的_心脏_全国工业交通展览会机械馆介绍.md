A Powerful "Heart"
    ——An Introduction to the Machinery Hall of the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition
    By our reporter Meng Fan

    When people, carrying their life experiences and years of dreams, enter the Machinery Hall of the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition, they can't help but feel excited. The steelmaking furnaces pouring molten steel, the towering oil drilling rigs, the enormous forging and power station equipment, the swarms of tractors, the various models of locomotives and automobiles, the precision machine tools and electrical instruments... Is all of this really made in our own country? But when you walk up to the machines, see the Chinese brands nailed onto them with your own eyes, and hear the explanations of the guides, your heart suddenly opens up. A strong sense of national pride surges through you. Today, our motherland is already capable of equipping all sectors of the national economy with its own machines.

    What a tremendous change this is! Eight years ago, China's machinery industry was still in a state of repair and assembly, and the machines it could manufacture were truly few and far between. Now, except for a few particularly large or particularly precise machines, we can basically manufacture everything ourselves. In the nearly 100-year history of China's modern machinery industry, 1936 was the year with the highest output of the machinery industry in old China. Even in that year, more than 80% of the machines needed nationwide were imported from abroad. After liberation, the Party led the people of the whole country in large-scale construction, fundamentally changing the backward state of the machinery industry. By 1957, China's self-sufficiency rate in machinery and equipment had reached more than 60%. After this year's Great Leap Forward, it is expected to reach more than 80%. The same 80% represents a world of difference. Not to mention that the overall industrial level of the country was very low at that time, the number of machines needed was small, and the variety was very limited, which simply cannot be compared with the enormous needs of today.

    Entering the hall is like arriving at a bountiful field of machinery. The various machines made during the First Five-Year Plan period, especially since the Great Leap Forward this year, are densely distributed, weaving a picture of the prosperity of China's economic construction. There are more than 3,400 items in twenty categories on display here. In the main hall, there are machine tools, motors, ship models, textile and printing machinery; the east and west side rooms have precision electronic instruments, electrical equipment, medical equipment, measuring tools, cutting tools, and various ball bearings. Huge metallurgical, mining, forging, fertilizer, and other heavy machinery, tractors, and other agricultural machinery are displayed in the east and west squares respectively. Crossing the east square and walking towards the rear lake, various petroleum machinery are exhibited next to the theater, followed by various models of automobiles, railway locomotives, and vehicles. As for irrigation and drainage machinery and small rural power stations, they have squeezed into a corner of the zoo along the lake shore.

    Heavy equipment is a symbol of a country's independent and powerful machinery industry. During the First Five-Year Plan period, although China's heavy machinery manufacturing made significant progress, it was almost blank in many aspects. However, after the Great Leap Forward in the first half of this year, these blanks began to be filled. The large and medium-sized rolling mills, hydraulic presses, and high-pressure reaction vessels exhibited in the east square are the most vivid examples. Walking down the steps from the east corridor of the exhibition hall, you are greeted by a blooming mill that is two stories high. Its rolls have a diameter of 700 millimeters, and the two stands alone weigh 50 tons. This is the first set of medium-sized rolling equipment designed and manufactured in China. This rolling mill can roll two-ton steel ingots and can roll 800,000 tons of steel ingots into steel billets annually. Next to it is a model of an even larger blooming mill. This rolling mill will also be manufactured successfully soon. When the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex officially started construction last year, the large blooming mill required was still ordered from abroad; a year later, when the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex is built, the same large blooming mill can be supplied by China itself.

    A hydraulic press is a forging and pressing equipment with great power. Large steel ingots weighing dozens of tons are placed on a hydraulic press like soft dough, and can be hammered into various shapes at will. The large shafts of trains and generators, automobile beams, crankshafts of large diesel engines, rolls, and keels of ships all need to be forged with hydraulic presses. Displayed in the center of the square is a model of a 2,500-ton hydraulic press recently made in China. Looking at the two parts placed next to it, you can imagine its magnificent appearance. A shining column is ten meters long and weighs fourteen tons. There should be four of these large columns on one hydraulic press. On the hydraulic press, a concave moving beam is considered a small part, but its net weight is 35 tons. Next to the hydraulic press, there is also a large steel ingot 3.9 meters high that two people cannot embrace. This is the raw material processed by the hydraulic press, with the white letters "forty-three tons" written on it.

    Many charts in the Machinery Hall tell people: providing more and better equipment for heavy industry is the primary task of China's machinery industry. During the First Five-Year Plan period, metallurgical equipment increased by 23 times, mining machinery increased by 38 times, and power station equipment increased by 33 times. Despite such a large increase, it still cannot meet the requirements in this year's Great Leap Forward, especially the manufacturing capacity of some large equipment is even weaker. After the rectification movement, the staff boldly created and have now found the secret to achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. "Ants gnawing at bones" is one of them. The model of the cylinder of a 2,400-horsepower nitrogen-hydrogen compressor processed with small machine tools displayed in the exhibition hall vividly shows the scene of four small "ants" surrounding a large "bone" or drilling into the "bone" to cut. Because of this method, not only was a well-performing large machine made, but the efficiency was also improved five or six times compared to processing with a boring machine. Another trick is slag welding. This technology has just appeared and has already shown its magic. Next to the "ants gnawing at bones" model, there are two exploded high-pressure reaction cylinders on display. This is also an important nitrogen fertilizer equipment, which can withstand more than 1,000 atmospheres. However, what is universally praised is the excellence of the welding technology shown from the exploded gap. Whether it is a high-pressure reaction cylinder welded from 26 layers of steel plates or a single-layer thick steel plate, after a burst test of more than 1,000 atmospheres, the damaged part is not on the weld. Reaching such a high level of welding technology means that large cast and forged parts such as the columns of hydraulic presses and rolling mill stands can be manufactured by segmented, sliced, and layered welding methods even without heavy equipment.

    Following the general line of socialist construction, the machinery industry has also equipped China's agriculture and transportation industries with a large number of machines. In the west square and on the shore of the rear lake, various irrigation and drainage power machinery and agricultural tillage machinery can be seen. The guides here tell people that in the first half of this year alone, the machinery industry manufactured and promoted more than 119 million improved agricultural tools, produced tens of thousands of tractor-drawn agricultural tools, as well as a large number of pesticide applicators and sideline processing machinery. At present, from land cultivation, sowing, fertilizing, weeding, irrigation, harvesting to sideline processing, machines can be used instead of manpower. Before this year, China had never completely made tractors. Now, more than 200 types have been successfully trial-produced in various places. Nearly a thousand units were produced in the first half of the year, and it is expected that about 20,000 units will be manufactured by the end of the year. Among all the tractors, the "Red Flag" brand tractor manufactured by Lingshan Farm Tool Factory has the highest power. It has 80 horsepower, and if you give it two five-bottom plows, it can cultivate more than 400 acres of land a day. If human and animal power are used to cultivate these lands, it would take more than 100 people driving more than 300 good horses to do it.

    This year's widespread high yields in Chinese agriculture and the continuous improvement of agricultural production technology have raised new issues for the manufacture of agricultural machinery. For example, agricultural technology requires a tillage depth of one to two feet, and the soil should be turned over and loosened; while the original plows can only till five to seven inches deep and cannot work in layers. The combine harvester, which is more efficient in harvesting machinery, is suitable for harvesting wheat with a yield of 200 to 300 catties per mu; to harvest wheat with a yield of 500 catties per mu, the efficiency will be reduced by half; as for wheat with a yield of several thousand catties per mu, it cannot be cut at all. At present, China's machinery industry departments are stepping up research and improvement of designs to adapt to the new situation of high agricultural yields.

    In the west square and on the shore of the rear lake, various transportation machinery are concentrated. Before liberation, China could not manufacture railway locomotives and large ships at all. Now, it can not only manufacture internal combustion, electric, and high-efficiency steam locomotives, but also manufacture 5,000-ton ships. The increase in the production of transportation machinery is also very rapid. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the number of various railway vehicles alone increased by more than 70 times. The various types of automobiles on display here have aroused great interest among people. Especially around the sedans, people are always crowded. China has more than 60 brands of automobiles produced by more than 20 countries, and was once known as the International Automobile Expo. But in the past few decades, not a single car was made in China. Since the birth of the "Liberation" truck in 1956, there are now more than 100 types of cars made in China. Even the relatively difficult to manufacture sedans have brands such as "Dongfeng", "Jinggangshan", "Peace", and "Red Flag", as well as the "Beijing" convertible. In particular, the "Red Flag" and "Beijing" convertibles are not only dignified and magnificent in appearance, but also adopt the latest technical equipment in the world, and are not inferior to the best cars manufactured by capitalist countries.

    Whether it is automobiles, locomotives, ships, or tractors, the lightest and most efficient power machinery is still the internal combustion engine. Before liberation, China could only manufacture a small number of low-level internal combustion engines, and the total horsepower produced in 1949 was only 4,000 horsepower. After eight years of development, the production level in 1957 had increased to 500,000 horsepower. Now, China can not only manufacture general diesel engines, gasoline engines, and gas engines, but also has mastered more complex technologies such as free pistons. Internal combustion water pumps, which have not been developed in capitalist countries, have also been innovated and promoted in China.

    Looking from a corner of the exhibition hall to the machine tool display stand, dozens of brand-new machine tools are arranged neatly, as if they were a flow production line in a mechanical workshop. The motors roared, and the tools or workpieces rotated rapidly. Various heavy-duty machine tools, high-precision machine tools, and automatic machine tools are on display here, as well as some simple machine tools. Entering the main entrance of the hall, you are greeted by a vertical lathe that is taller than two people. It can process parts with an outer diameter of up to 2.3 meters and weighs more than ten tons. When the operator presses a button, the machine tool roars to life, and as the workpiece rotates, the powerful tool cuts into the workpiece 9 mm per rotation, like cutting wood. Workers say that this is not the largest. China has already made 2.7-meter vertical lathes, and 3-meter to 4-meter vertical lathes will also be manufactured this year. With such a large vertical lathe, it is possible to process the large shafts of tens of thousands of kilowatts generators. High-precision machine tools are one of the important conditions for the development of cutting-edge technology. For example, processing precision gears in rockets and radars, as well as some precision instrument parts, tools, etc., requires high-precision machine tools. This kind of machine tool is very difficult to manufacture, and in the past, China did not have a self-made one. In this year's Great Leap Forward, China has been able to manufacture gear grinding machines, coordinate boring machines, and screw grinding machines. The gear grinding machine manufactured by Shanghai Machine Tool Factory is used for the final precision machining of precision gears, shaving cutters, gear shaping cutters, etc. The error in processing two gears does not exceed three micrometers, which is equivalent to one-thirtieth of a hair, and the finish can reach level ten to eleven. The coordinate boring machine made by Kunming Machine Tool Factory adopts an inductive and automatic calculation joint device. The processed parts are placed on the worktable, and the worktable can automatically move in two directions, longitudinal and transverse, to determine the processing position of the parts. The error of parts with precision holes processed by it does not exceed five micrometers. In recent years, China's machine tools have not only widely adopted electrical and hydraulic automatic control devices, but also applied many new technological achievements. Only the ones exhibited in the hall include electric spark machine tools, ultrasonic machining machine tools, etc. At present, China's machine tool industry is further researching the application of new technologies, such as machine tools controlled by electronic computers, and the application of radioactive elements in machine tools.

    To make machines, you must first have machine tools. In the equipment of the entire machinery industry, machine tools usually account for 70% to 80%. The number of machine tools produced in China before liberation was very small, and in 1949 it was only more than 1,500 units. At the end of the First Five-Year Plan period, the annual output of machine tools reached more than 37,000 units, an increase of 24 times compared with 1949. This year, the whole people are running the machinery industry in a big way, and the staff in various places are building machine tools in a big way under the promotion of the technological revolution. It is estimated that the annual output will reach 80,000 units. Five months ago, there were only two machine tool factories in Beijing, but now there are 30. Schools, factories, cooperatives, and other five major forces in the city are attacking the machine tool fortress together. They have successfully trial-produced 350 types of machine tools in just one month. The simple machine tools and indigenous machine tools made of wood and cement by the staff in many areas are also very excellent. The lathe made of cement by Chongqing Changan Machinery Factory weighs twelve tons, but it only uses more than two tons of steel materials and can process workpieces with a diameter of 1.2 meters.

    When people reluctantly leave the hall and relive everything inside, they feel unspeakable excitement. The machinery industry is often compared to the heart of heavy industry. Now, this heart is supplying the entire national economy with vigorous youthful blood, making the giant of New China grow stronger.

    强大的“心脏”
    ——全国工业交通展览会机械馆介绍
    本报记者　孟帆
    当人们带着自己生活的经历，多年的梦想，走进全国工业交通展览会的机械馆，都会抑制不住内心的激动。那些倾泄着钢水的炼钢炉，高耸入云的石油钻机，巨大的锻压和电站设备，成群的拖拉机，各种型号的机车和汽车，精密的机床和电工仪表……这一切难道都是我国自己制造的吗？可是当你走到机器旁边，亲眼看见钉在上面的中国牌号，听到了讲解员的介绍，心胸便豁然开朗。一种强烈的民族自豪感在心头荡漾。今天的祖国已经能够用自己的机器装备国民经济各个部门了。
    这是多么巨大的变化！八年前，我国机械工业还处于修配状态，能够制造的机器真是寥若晨星。现在除了少数特别大型或特别精密的机械外，基本上都能自己制造了。在我国近代机械工业近百年的发展史上，1936年曾是旧中国机械工业产量最高的一年。就是那一年，全国需要的机器还有80％以上是从国外进口的。解放以后，党领导全国人民进行大规模建设的结果，从根本上改变了机械工业落后的面貌。到1957年，我国机器设备自给程度已经达到60％以上。经过今年的大跃进，预计可以达到80％以上。同是80％，相差何等悬殊。更不要说，那时全国的工业水平很低，需要的机器数量很小、品种很少，简直无法同现在偌大的需要相比拟。
    进入馆内，好像来到了机械丰产田。第一个五年计划期间，特别是今年大跃进以来制成的各种机械，纵横密布，交织出一幅我国经济建设的繁荣景象。这里陈列的产品有二十类、三千四百多项。在大厅内，布满了机床、电机、船舶模型、纺织和印刷机械；东西侧室有精密的电子仪表、电气设备、医疗器械、量具刃具和各种滚珠轴承。巨大的冶金、矿山、锻压、化肥等重型机械，拖拉机及其他农业机械分别陈列在东西广场上。穿过东广场向后湖走去，在剧场旁展出了各种石油机械，接着是各种型号的汽车、铁路机车和车辆。至于排灌机械和农村小型发电站，已顺湖岸挤入动物园的一角。
    重型设备是一个国家拥有独立、强大机械工业的标志。在第一个五年计划期间，我国重型机械的制造虽然有重大发展，但在许多方面还几乎是空白，但是，经过今年上半年的大跃进，这些空白开始填补起来了。东广场上展出的大中型轧钢机，水压机和高压反应筒，就是最鲜明的例证。从展览馆的东廊走下阶石，迎面屹立着一台有两层楼高的初轧机。它的轧辊直径有七百公厘，仅两片机架就有五十吨重。这是我国自己设计制造的第一套中型轧钢设备。这部轧钢机可以轧制两吨重的钢锭，全年能把八十万吨钢锭轧成钢坯。在它旁边，还有一台更大的初轧机的模型。这部轧钢机不久也将制造成功。去年武汉钢铁联合企业正式动工的时候，需要的大型初轧机还是从国外订货；一年后的今天，当包头钢铁联合企业兴建的时候，同样大的初轧机就可以由我国自己供应了。
    水压机是一种具有极大威力的锻压设备。几十吨重的大钢锭，放在水压机上就像柔软的面团，被任意锤打成各种形状。火车、发电机的大轴，汽车大梁，大型柴油机的曲轴，轧辊，轮船的龙骨，都需要用水压机锻造。陈列在广场中心的是我国刚刚制成的二千五百吨水压机的模型。看了放置在它身边的两个零件，就可以想像出它的宏伟面貌。一根闪闪发光的立柱有十公尺长，重十四吨。一台水压机上光这样的大立柱就要四根。在水压机上，一个类似凹形的活动横梁算是小零件，可是它的净重就有三十五吨。在水压机旁，还立着一个高三点九公尺、两个人张开双臂还不能合抱的大钢锭。这是水压机加工的原料，上面写着的白字是“四十三吨”。
    机械馆内的许多图表告诉人们：为重工业提供更多更好的装备，是我国机械工业的首要任务。在第一个五年计划期间，冶金设备增长了二十三倍，矿山机械增长了三十八倍，电站设备增长了三十三倍。尽管增长这样多，但是在今年的大跃进中仍然不能满足要求，特别是一些大型设备的制造能力就更加薄弱。经过整风运动，职工们大胆创造，现在已经找到了多快好省的妙诀。“蚂蚁啃骨头”就是其中的一种。展览馆内陈列的用小机床加工二千四百马力氮氢气压缩机的汽缸模型，形象地表现出四个小“蚂蚁”围在大“骨头”四周或者钻入
  “骨头”里面啃切的情景。由于采用了这个办法，不仅做出了性能良好的大机器，而且比用镗床加工提高效率五、六倍。另一个妙诀是熔渣焊接。这种技术刚刚出现，就已经显出它的神妙。在“蚂蚁啃骨头”模型旁，陈列着两个爆破的高压反应筒。这也是重要的氮肥设备，它能够承受一千以上的大气压。可是，受到人们普遍赞美的还是从那爆破的缺口上，表现的焊接技术的卓绝。无论是二十六层钢板或单层厚钢板焊成的高压反应筒，经过一千多个大气压的爆破试验，破损的地方都不在焊口上。焊接技术达到这样高的水平，就意味着水压机的立柱、轧钢机架等大型铸锻零件，即使没有重型设备，也可以用分段、分片、分层焊接的办法制造出来。
    机械工业遵循社会主义建设总路线，还以大量机械装备了我国农业和交通运输业。在西广场和后湖岸上，可以看到各种排灌动力机械和农业耕作机械。这里的讲解员告诉人们：仅在今年上半年，机械工业就制造和推广了一亿一千九百多万件改良农具，生产了数万台机引农具以及大量的农药械和副业加工机械。目前从耕地、播种、施肥、锄草、灌溉、收割到副业加工，都可以用机器代替人力了。今年以前，我国还没有完整地做过拖拉机，现在各地已经试制成功了二百多种，上半年生产了近千台，预计到年底将制造出两万台左右。在所有的拖拉机中，灵山农具厂制造的“红旗”牌拖拉机功率最大。它有八十马力，给它带上两个五铧犁，一天能耕地四百多亩。如果用人力和畜力耕这些地，就要一百多人驾上三百多匹好马才能办到。
    今年我国农业的普遍高产和农业生产技术的不断提高，为农业机械的制造提出了新课题。如农业技术要求耕深一二尺，并且要翻熟土、松生土；而原有的犁只能耕深五寸到七寸，并且不能分层作业。在收获机械中效率较好的康拜因，用来收获亩产二、三百斤的小麦很合适；要收割亩产五百斤的小麦效率就要减半；至于亩产几千斤的小麦根本割不动。目前，我国机械工业部门正加紧研究改进设计，来适应农业高产的新形势。
    在西广场和后湖湖岸，集中了各种交通机械。解放前，我国根本不能制造铁路机车、大型船舶，现在不仅能制造内燃、电气和高效率的蒸气机车，而且能够制造五千吨的轮船了。交通运输机械生产量的增长也十分迅速。在第一个五年计划期间，仅各种铁路车辆就增长了七十多倍。在这里陈列的各种类型的汽车，引起人们很大兴趣。特别是在小轿车的周围，人总是挤得满满的。我国有着二十多个国家出产的六十多种牌号的汽车，曾被称为国际汽车博览会。可是在过去的几十年里，没有一辆汽车是我国自制的。从1956年“解放牌”汽车诞生起，现在我国自制的汽车已有一百多种了。即使是比较难于制造的小轿车，也有了“东风”、“井冈山”、“和平”、“红旗”等牌号，还有“北京”牌敞车。特别是“红旗”和“北京”敞车，不仅外观庄严富丽，而且采用了世界最新的技术装备，比起资本主义国家制造的最好汽车并无逊色。
    无论是汽车、机车、船舶和拖拉机，目前最轻便、效率最高的动力机械还是内燃机。解放前我国只能制造少量低级的内燃机，到1949年生产的总马力也只有四千匹。经过八年的发展，1957年的生产水平已提高到五十万马力。现在我国不仅能制造一般的柴油机、汽油机和煤气机，而且掌握了自由活塞等较复杂的技术了。在资本主义国家得不到发展的内燃水泵，也被我国加以革新、发扬起来。
    从展览馆大厅的一角向机床陈列台望去，几十部崭新的机床整齐地排列着，仿佛是机械车间的一条流水生产线。马达发出隆隆的响声，刀具或工作物飞快地旋转着。这里陈列着各种重型机床、高精度机床和自动化机床，还有一部分简易机床。进入大厅的正门，迎面陈列着一台比两个人还高的立式车床。它加工零件外圆直径可到二点三公尺，重量达到十几吨。操作的工人一按电钮，这台机床吼动起来，随着工作物的转动，强有力的刀具像削木材一样，每转一圈就切进工作物九公厘。工人们说，这还不是最大的，我国已经做出了二点七公尺的立车，三公尺到四公尺的立车也要在今年制造出来。有了这样大的立车，就可以加工几万瓩的发电机大轴了。高精度机床是发展尖端技术的重要条件之一。如加工火箭和雷达中的精密齿轮以及一些精密的仪表零件、刀具等，都需要高精度机床。这种机床制造很困难，过去我国一台自制的也没有。在今年的大跃进中，我国已能制造齿轮磨床、座标镗床和螺丝磨床了。上海机床厂制造的齿轮磨床，是用来对精密齿轮、剃齿刀、插齿刀等进行最后的精加工的。它加工两个齿轮的误差不超过三个公微，即相当于一根头发的三十分之一，光洁度可以达到十级到十一级。昆明机床厂制成的座标镗床采用了电感应和自动计算联合装置，把加工的零件放在工作台上，工作台可以自动向纵横两个方向移动，确定零件加工的位置。它加工的带有精密孔的零件，误差不超过五公微。最近几年来，我国机床不仅广泛采用了电气的、液压的自动控制装置，而且应用了许多新技术成就。仅大厅中展出的就有电火花机床、超声波加工机床等。目前我国机床工业正在进一步研究应用新技术，如用电子计算机指挥工作的机床、放射性元素在机床中的应用等。
    要造机器，首先要机床。在整个机械工业的装备中，机床通常要占70％到80％。我国解放前生产机床的数量很少，到1949年也不过一千五百多台。第一个五年计划末期，机床的年产量达到了三万七千多台，比1949年增长了二十四倍。今年，全民大办机械工业，各地职工在技术革命推动下大造机床，预计年产量将达到八万台。北京市在五个月以前，只有两个机床厂，如今已经有了三十个。全市学校、工厂、合作社等五路大军齐攻机床堡垒，只有一个月就试制成功三百五十种机床。许多地区职工用木材、水泥制造的简易机床、土机床也十分出色。重庆长安机器厂用水泥制造的车床有十二吨重，可是只用两吨多钢铁材料，能加工直径一点二公尺的工作物。
    当人们深情难舍地走出大厅，重温馆内的一切的时候，真有说不出的兴奋。机械工业常常被人们比做重工业的心脏。现在，这颗心脏正以旺盛的青春血液供给整个国民经济部门，使新中国巨人成长得更加强壮。
