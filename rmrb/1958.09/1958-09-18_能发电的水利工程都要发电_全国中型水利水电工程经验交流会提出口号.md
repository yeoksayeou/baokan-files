Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 17th: The National Experience Exchange Meeting on Medium-Sized Water Conservancy and Hydropower Projects, which concluded here on the 15th, put forward the slogan: All water conservancy projects capable of generating electricity must generate electricity. Each county should first build a hydropower station of around 500 to 1,000 kilowatts, and each special district should first build a hydropower station of around 5,000 to 10,000 kilowatts in order to gain experience and promote overall development. We must combine it with the high tide of water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, so that hydropower construction and shipping construction can take off with wings.

This meeting was jointly convened by the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power and the China Water Conservancy Society. More than 370 attendees visited 25 typical medium-sized projects in Hebei, Henan, Hunan, and Hubei provinces in two groups, starting from August 21st. They gathered in Zhengzhou on September 5th to start the meeting. During the meeting, representatives from various regions made 31 typical reports and discussed 25 special topics in groups.

The meeting pointed out that the guiding ideology of water conservancy construction should be elevated from simple flood prevention and waterlogging removal to water storage and irrigation, and also solve the problem of how to utilize water energy for power generation and how to combine it with the development of shipping. Water conservancy should not only serve agriculture but also serve industry and transportation, to adapt to the rapidly developing situation of socialist construction.

The meeting believed that the principle of "relying mainly on the strength of the masses, supplemented by state assistance" should be implemented in running medium-sized water conservancy projects. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 3,303 medium-sized projects have been completed in various regions in the past year, including 1,592 reservoir projects and 211 power generation projects. The vast majority of these projects were run by the masses themselves. With few or even no technicians, the working people were full of energy and brought into play their infinite wisdom, replacing machinery with their own hands and indigenous methods, and accomplishing earth-shattering feats with their own financial resources and communist spirit of cooperation.

In order to build medium-sized projects in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, the meeting proposed that the following links must be grasped: strengthen Party leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, resolutely rely on the masses, implement the principle of using local methods instead of foreign ones, combining local and foreign methods, self-reliance, using local materials, and adopting various substitutes, and implement the principle of diligence and thrift in running projects; break down superstition, liberate thinking, vigorously carry out technical revolution, and promote various advanced design and construction methods; promote the communist spirit and further develop communist large-scale cooperation; pay attention to the safety, management, and maintenance of medium-sized projects, and consolidate and give full play to the benefits of the projects.

    能发电的水利工程都要发电
    全国中型水利水电工程经验交流会提出口号
    据新华社郑州17日电　15日在此间闭幕的全国中型水利水电工程经验交流会议提出口号：能发电的水利工程都要发电，每县先建一个五百到一千瓩上下的水电站，每个专区先建一个五千到一万瓩上下的水电站，以便吸取经验，推动全面。要结合今冬明春的水利建设高潮，让水电建设和航运建设作为它的两翼展翅高飞。
    这次会议是水利电力部、中国水利学会联合召开的，出席会议的三百七十多人，从8月21日开始，分两路参观了河北、河南、湖南、湖北四省的二十五个中型典型工程。9月5日开始集中到郑州开会。会议期间，各地代表作了三十一个典型报告，并分组讨论了二十五个专题。
    会议指出，水利建设的指导思想在由单纯的防洪除涝提高到蓄水灌溉后，还要解决如何利用水能发电，如何结合发展航运事业等问题。水利不仅为农业服务，而且要为工业和运输事业服务，以适应社会主义建设飞跃发展的形势。
    会议认为，兴办中型水利工程应该贯彻“依靠群众力量为主，国家援助为辅”的方针。据不完全统计，一年来各地共完成中型工程三千三百零三处，其中水库工程一千五百九十二处，发电工程二百一十一处。这些工程绝大多数是群众自办的，在技术人员很少甚至没有技术人员的情况下，劳动人民干劲冲天，发挥了无穷的智慧，以双手和土办法代替机械，以自己的财力和共产主义协作精神，干出了惊天动地的事业。
    为了多快好省地兴办中型工程，会议提出必须抓住以下环节：加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，坚决依靠群众，实行以土代洋，土洋结合，自力更生，就地取材，采用各种代用品，贯彻勤俭办工程的原则；破除迷信，解放思想，大闹技术革命，推广各种先进的设计和施工方法；发扬共产主义精神，进一步开展共产主义大协作；注意中型工程的安全和管理养护，巩固和发挥工程效益。
