Answering Readers' Questions on Several Issues Concerning Territorial Waters

    Since our government issued the statement on the issue of territorial waters, many readers have written to raise some questions about territorial waters. Here are the answers:——Editor

    1. What are territorial waters?
    Territorial waters, also known as territorial seas, refer to a sea area of a certain width along the coast of a country, which is an integral part of the coastal country's territory and under its sovereignty. Territorial waters have basically two meanings for coastal countries: one is economic, because territorial waters are the place of marine resources and sea routes; the other is national defense, because territorial waters are marine defense areas, defending against attacks from the sea. Since territorial waters are under the sovereign power of the coastal country, the right to decide on the width of territorial waters and the method of calculating it belongs to the authority of that country.
    2. What is the situation of various countries' regulations on the width of territorial waters?
    The decision to set the width of China's territorial waters at twelve nautical miles is a major decision by our government in exercising our sovereignty. At present, the regulations on the width of territorial waters vary from country to country. The United States, Britain, Japan, and other countries stipulate three nautical miles. Denmark, Sweden, and other countries stipulate four nautical miles, Iran, Cuba, and other countries stipulate six nautical miles, and the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, the United Arab Republic, Ethiopia, Libya, Guatemala, Ecuador, Venezuela, Indonesia, and Iceland, a total of twelve countries, stipulate twelve nautical miles. Chile stipulates fifty kilometers, and El Salvador stipulates two hundred nautical miles. The Eighth Session of the United Nations International Law Commission proposed the principle of not exceeding twelve nautical miles for the width of territorial waters. From February to April this year, there was a fierce struggle over the issue of the width of territorial waters at the United Nations International Conference on the Law of the Sea held in Geneva. Although the conference failed to reach a resolution passed by a two-thirds majority, the discussion proved that most countries opposed the unreasonable insistence of the United States and Britain on limiting it to three nautical miles, and agreed to the proposal of not exceeding twelve nautical miles. Therefore, China's stipulation of twelve nautical miles as the width of territorial waters is fully justified both from the perspective of international practice and from the principles of international law.
    3. Why do imperialist countries insist on a territorial sea width of three nautical miles?
    The reason is simple: imperialist countries do not proceed from the interests of international navigation, but from the ambition to carry out aggression and infringe upon the political and economic interests of other countries. There was a historical episode that is enough to illustrate this point. In 1896, the Netherlands proposed expanding the width of territorial waters to six nautical miles. Many countries agreed, but Britain opposed it. The Dutch ambassador once persuaded the British Foreign Secretary Salisbury, saying: "If Britain extends its territorial waters to six nautical miles, Britain can naturally get more benefits for its own fisheries." The British Foreign Secretary replied: "If the width of territorial waters increases, we will not be able to fish near your coast. You must know that no matter how wide our territorial waters are, we still have to go there to fish." Recently, Britain openly disregarded Iceland's announcement of expanding the width of its territorial waters to twelve nautical miles, and sent warships to protect fishing fleets to fish in Icelandic territorial waters, and even detained ten Icelandic naval personnel. This is the best footnote to why imperialist countries insist that the width of territorial waters should not exceed three nautical miles.
    After learning about China's announcement on the declaration of territorial waters, a U.S. State Department official said: "Our attitude towards territorial waters has always been—as far as I know, this has been traced back to the Jefferson era—three nautical miles." As for what the so-called three nautical miles "traditional territorial sea width" is all about, and whether there is any basis in international law, we only need to look at the reasons for stipulating three nautical miles at that time to understand. The first country to determine the width of territorial waters to be three nautical miles was the United States, in 1793. Later, Russia, Britain, and France also followed suit (Russia later changed it to twelve nautical miles). This was based on the range of artillery at that time being three nautical miles. At that time, it was believed that coastal countries could control the sea area within three nautical miles with onshore artillery fire, which was its territorial waters. Then, now that weapons have been greatly improved, the width of three nautical miles has long lost its basis and has in fact been abandoned by most countries. Now there are only about twenty countries that still use three nautical miles as the width of their territorial waters. The U.S. State Department spokesman forgot that the U.S. "has always had an attitude of three nautical miles towards territorial waters," and was forced to change it at the United Nations International Conference on the Law of the Sea this year. At the meeting on April 18, the U.S. representative Dean suggested that the territorial sea be changed from three nautical miles to six nautical miles. This suggestion was also supported by Britain. The so-called "traditional territorial sea width" excuse of the United States and Britain has long been bankrupt.
    4. What is the high seas?
    The high seas refer to the sea and ocean areas commonly used by all countries. In the high seas, ships and citizens of all countries are free to navigate, fish, hunt, and engage in other maritime activities, and lay submarine cables. The principle of freedom of the high seas has been recognized by international law and various countries.
    5. How is the width of territorial waters calculated?
    From where on the coast should the width of territorial waters be calculated? Therefore, it is necessary to designate a line on the coast so that a certain width of sea area can be measured outwards from this line. This line is regarded as the baseline of the territorial sea. There are generally two methods of delineating the baseline of the territorial sea internationally: one is called the "normal baseline method" (attached diagram), which uses the low-water line of the sea as the baseline of the territorial sea (the line that recedes furthest from the shore when the tide ebbs), and then measures the width of the territorial sea outwards from this baseline. The other is the "straight baseline method" (attached diagram), which is to first select certain points on the mainland shore and on the islands along the outer edge of the coast as base points, and connect every two adjacent base points with a straight line, and use these straight lines as the baseline to delineate a certain width of sea area outwards as the territorial sea. This method is generally applicable to countries with relatively tortuous coasts, and it would be more difficult to draw a territorial sea boundary if the "normal baseline method" is used. The method currently adopted by our government is the "straight baseline method."
    6. What is an internal sea?
    The waters between the baseline and the coastline are internal seas. It is part of the coastal country's territory. The coastal country has the right to close the internal sea, not allowing foreign ships to enter, or stipulating special regulations that must be followed when entering the internal sea. Countries have different regulations on how wide the entrance to the internal sea should be, and there is no recognized view. The Seventh Session of the United Nations International Law Commission (1955) advocated setting the limit of the bay mouth at twenty-five nautical miles, which is reasonable, because in principle it allows for a territorial sea of twelve nautical miles. However, the Eighth Session (1956) advocated reducing this limit to fifteen nautical miles, which is unreasonable. Although this committee has set a limit of fifteen nautical miles for the bay mouth in the "Provisions on the Law of the Sea," it still believes that this "provision does not apply to so-called 'historical' bays." The "historical bay" referred to here is considered to have a wider bay mouth and has been actually controlled by the coastal country for a long period of time. China's Bohai Bay is our internal sea. Although the mouth of Bohai Bay is forty-five nautical miles wide, there is a series of islands at the mouth of the bay, with a total of eight entrances, and the widest entrance (the entrance between the Liaodong Peninsula and Beihuangcheng Island) is about 22.5 nautical miles. The width of China's territorial sea is twelve nautical miles, so this widest entrance is also within twenty-four nautical miles. At the same time, Bohai Bay is our internal sea and also meets the conditions of a "historical bay," and there has been a precedent of international recognition. As early as 1864, when Prussia and Denmark were at war, a Prussian gunboat captured a Danish ship in the Bohai Sea. The then Chinese government protested on the grounds that the Bohai Sea was China's internal sea. As a result, the Prussian side released the Danish ship. This is a precedent for international recognition of Bohai Bay as our internal sea about one hundred years ago. Other countries have similar examples. For example, Canada considers Hudson Bay as an internal sea, with a bay mouth width of about seventy-five nautical miles; Britain considers the Bristol Channel as an internal sea, with a bay mouth width of about one hundred nautical miles.

　　关于领海的几个问题答读者问
    自从我国政府发表了关于领海问题的声明后，不少读者来信提出一些有关领海的问题，现分别解答如下。　　　　　——编者
    1．什么是领海？
    领海，也可称作领水，是指一国沿岸一定宽度的海域，为沿岸国领土的组成部分，处于该国主权之下。领海对沿岸国基本上有两种意义，一是经济上的意义，因为领海是海洋资源的产地和海上航路；一是国防上的意义，因为领海是海洋防御区域，防御来自海上的进攻。领海既然处于沿岸国主权权力之下，所以制定领海宽度及其计算方法问题的决定权属于这个国家的权限。
    2．各国规定领海宽度的情况是怎样的？
    规定我国领海宽度为十二海里，是我国政府行使我国主权的一个重大决定。目前世界各国关于领海宽度的规定不一。美国、英国和日本等国，规定为三海里。丹麦、瑞典等国规定为四海里，伊朗、古巴等国规定为六海里，苏联、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿拉伯联合共和国、埃塞俄比亚、利比亚、危地马拉、厄瓜多尔、委内瑞拉、印度尼西亚和冰岛等十二国，规定为十二海里。智利规定为五十公里，萨尔瓦多规定为二百海里。联合国国际法委员会第八届会议对领海宽度问题，曾提出不超过十二海里的原则。今年2月到4月间，在日内瓦举行的联合国国际海洋法会议上，对领海宽度问题，有过激烈的斗争，虽则大会没有能得到一个为三分之二多数通过的决议，但是，在讨论中却证明了大多数国家反对美国和英国所无理坚持的以三海里为限的提案，而同意不超过十二海里的提案。因之，我国规定以十二海里为领海宽度无论从国际实践中来看，无论从国际法原则来看，都是完全有根据的。
    3．帝国主义国家为什么坚持领海宽度为三海里？
    理由很简单，就是由于帝国主义国家并不是从国际航海的利益出发，而是从便于进行侵略和侵犯别的国家的政治经济利益的野心出发的。曾经有过一段历史的插曲，足以说明这一点。在1896年的时候，荷兰提议把领海宽度扩大到六海里，许多国家同意了，但是英国反对。荷兰大使曾为此劝说英国外相萨里斯贝利，他说：“英国如把领海推广到六海里，则英国对自己的渔业自然也可以得到更多的好处。”英国外相却回答说：“领海宽度一增加，我们就不能到你们海岸的近处捕鱼。要知道，无论我们的领海多么宽，我们还是要到你们那里去捕鱼的。”最近，英国公然不顾冰岛宣布领海宽度扩大到十二海里，派了军舰掩护渔船队到冰岛领海中去捕鱼，甚至扣了十名冰岛的海军人员，就是帝国主义国家为什么坚持领海宽度不得超过三海里的最好注解。
    美国国务院官员在知道我国宣布关于领海的声明后，曾表示：“我们历来对领海的态度——据我所知道的这一直追溯到杰斐逊时代——一直是三海里。”至于所谓三海里是“传统领海宽度”究竟是怎么回事呢？是不是有什么国际法的根据呢？我们只需要来看一下当时规定三海里的缘由就会明白的。确定领海宽度为三海里的第一个国家是美国，时在1793年。以后俄国、英国、法国也先后如法泡制（后来俄国又改为十二海里）。这是根据当时大炮的射程为三海里而定的，当时认为，沿岸国家用岸上的炮火能够控制三海里以内的海域，是它的领海。那么，到了武器已经大大改进了的今天，三海里的宽度早已丧失根据了，并且在事实上也已经被多数国家所抛弃。现在还以三海里为领海宽度的国家只有二十来国了。美国国务院的发言人忘掉了美国“历来对领海的态度一直是三海里”的说法，就在今年联合国国际海洋法会议上已经被迫改变了。美国的代表迪恩在4月18日的会议上，建议领海由三海里改为六海里。这个建议也得到了英国的支持。美英两国所谓的“传统领海宽度”的借口早已破产了。
    4．什么是公海？
    公海是指所有国家共同使用的海和洋的境域。在公海中，各国船舶和公民都可以自由航行、捕鱼、狩猎和经营其他海上事业以及敷设海底电线。公海自由原则得到了国际法和各国的承认。
    5．领海宽度怎样算法？
    领海宽度应当从海岸什么地方算起呢？因此需要在海岸上指定一条线，以便从这一条线起向外测量出来一定宽度的海域，这一条线就算做领海基线。划定领海基线的方法在国际上一般有两种：一种称为“正常基线方法”（附图），就是以海的低潮线作为领海的基线（当海潮退潮时退到离岸最远的那一条线），然后从这条基线向外测量出领海的宽度。另一种是“直基线方法”（附图），即在大陆岸上和沿海岸外缘岛屿上先选定某些点作为基点，将这些基点的每两个邻近基点之间连成直线，以这些直线为基线向外划出一定宽度的海域作为领海。这种方法一般适用于海岸比较曲折的国家，如果采用“正常基线方法”就比较困难划出一条领海界限。我国政府现在所采用的就是“直基线方法”。
    6．什么是内海？
    在基线和岸线之间的水域是内海。它是沿岸国家领土的一部分。沿岸国家有权关闭内海，不让外国船只进入，或规定进入内海必须遵守的特别规定。内海入口应有多宽的问题，各国规定不一，没有公认的看法。联合国国际法委员会第七届会议（1955年）主张把湾口限度定二十五海里，这是合理的，因为原则上容许有十二海里的领海。但第八届会议（1956年）又主张把这一限度缩减为十五海里，这是不合理的。这个委员会在“关于海法的条款”中虽定出十五海里的湾口限度，也仍认为这一“规定不适用于所称为‘历史性的’海湾”。此处所称“历史性的海湾”是认为湾口较宽而且经沿岸国长久时间里实际掌握着管治权。我国渤海湾，是我国的内海。渤海湾口虽有四十五海里之宽，但是在湾口有一系列岛屿，共有八个入口，而且最宽的一个入口（辽东半岛和北隍城岛之间的入口）约二十二点五海里。我国领海宽度为十二海里，则这个最宽的入口也在二十四海里之内。同时，渤海湾是我国内海，也符合“历史性的海湾”的情况，曾经有过国际承认的先例。早在1864年，普鲁士和丹麦发生战争，普鲁士的一艘炮舰在渤海曾捕获了一只丹麦船。当时的中国政府以渤海是中国内海为理由，提出抗议，结果普鲁士方面释放了丹麦船。这是约一百年前国际上承认渤海湾为我国内海的一个先例。其他国家也有类似例子。如加拿大认为哈得逊湾为内海，湾口宽约七十五海里；英国认为布里斯托尔海峡为内海，湾口宽约一百海里。
