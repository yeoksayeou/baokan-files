Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Representatives and observers speaking at the Fifth Congress of the International Student Union today unanimously pointed out that the national liberation movements of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries have converged into an irresistible historical torrent that will wash away all the evils of imperialism and colonialism from the face of the earth.

In their speeches at today's congress, the representatives strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs and its military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area. They pointed out that Taiwan is a province of China and an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and that the people of the whole world stand on China's side, fully supporting the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan.

At today's congress, Mohammed Elmuha, the student representative of the Republic of Iraq, gave a moving report to the congress on the heroic struggle of the Iraqi people.

Elmuha pointed out that the revolutionary experience of the Iraqi people once again proves that imperialism is a paper tiger. He said that imperialism has always regarded Iraq as the most reliable country for carrying out its aggression in the Middle East, but the Iraqi people's revolution finally shattered this imperialist fortress. This revolution shook the old roots of imperialism in the Middle East and was also a great demonstration of the Arab national liberation movement.

He said that the imperialists are not reconciled to admitting their defeat. The day after the Iraqi revolution, U.S. and British troops occupied Lebanon and Jordan because they feared that the people of these countries would also rise up in revolution and attempt to overthrow the revolutionary Iraqi government by force. However, the revolutionary Iraqi government, regardless of the external frantic provocations, resolutely announced its policy of adhering to the Bandung Conference principles and maintaining friendly relations with all countries in the world. As a result, the revolutionary government quickly received widespread support from the people. The imperialists were defeated again.

Elmuha pointed out that the struggle waged by the Iraqi people and students has won the support of millions of people. The U.S. imperialists' barbaric aggression against the people of the Middle East exposes them as the deadly enemy of national independence and world peace for all countries. Imperialism and colonialism are the root of all evil deeds and wars. These ugly things will one day be rolled out of our world forever.

Elmuha finally pointed out that although the United Nations General Assembly Special Emergency Session passed a resolution calling for the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from the Middle East, their troops are still occupying Lebanon and Jordan. He said that the United States and Britain must immediately withdraw their troops from this region.

In his report, Elmuha expressed the need to strengthen unity and cooperation among students from various countries, especially among students from Arab countries, and firmly support the struggle of colonial countries against colonialism and for national independence. He particularly stated that the Iraqi people firmly support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan.

The representatives of four Latin American countries, Guatemala, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Mexico, who spoke at the meeting today, jointly condemned the military, political, and economic aggression carried out by U.S. imperialism in Latin American countries. They said that the Yankees are plundering the rich resources of their countries, supporting the dictatorial governments most hated by the people, barbarously interfering in the internal affairs of their countries, and destroying the dignity of the people of these countries. They said that Cuba's reactionary dictatorial rulers are using weapons given to them by the United States to slaughter the Cuban people who are demanding independence.

They said that all these barbaric suppressions by U.S. imperialism can never destroy the fighting will and the conviction of victory of the Latin American people. Guatemalan representative Segura said in his speech that a huge anti-colonial movement has now been set off in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the oppressed people are jubilantly preparing to welcome the day of their liberation. He declared in a confident voice that the era of colonialism has gone bankrupt.

Representatives and observers from West Africa, Cameroon, North Africa, Algeria, and Black Africa unanimously expressed in their speeches their determination to unite with the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world, and to continue to resolutely oppose colonialism and strive for national independence.

Algerian representative Ait Chelal said in his speech that we have learned from our own experience that it is impossible to have true national culture and the development of education under colonial rule. The shackles of colonialism have forced Algerian students to awaken and participate in the struggle for national independence. Although many people have heroically sacrificed themselves and batches of students have been imprisoned in concentration camps and subjected to various tortures and abuses, the Algerian people and students will persevere in their struggle until the final victory.

Cameroonian representative Joseph Send reported to the congress on the heroic struggle of Cameroonian students against the colonialists. Joseph Send said that in recent years, the Cameroonian people have suffered looting, torture, and abuse at the hands of the French colonialists. Now our people have taken up arms and organized guerrillas to fight back against the French colonialists. Cameroonian students have also heroically participated in the armed struggle with the people against the colonialists and their agents. We are deeply convinced that the Cameroonian people will soon overcome colonial rule, just like the victory of the Chinese people's revolution.

Albanian student representative Dai Keluxi said in his speech that U.S. imperialism is creating tensions in many parts of the world and is carrying out heinous nuclear weapons tests in defiance of the opposition of the people of the world. These heinous activities of U.S. imperialism will surely be completely crushed in the face of the powerful peace-loving people of the world. Dai Keluxi also said that the ugly colonialist system is a disgrace to our era. National independence is impossible as long as colonialism is not eliminated. The youth and students of socialist Albania will, under any circumstances, always sympathize with and resolutely support the struggle of the people and students of all countries against colonialism and for national independence. If necessary, they can unswervingly take up arms and fight, even at the cost of their own lives.

The Cambodian student representative showed in his speech their ambition to dare to despise U.S. imperialism and the aggressive bloc. He said that Cambodia pursues a neutral policy externally based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, and actively develops a national independent economy internally. However, this is not without difficulties. The United States scares us. It directs South Vietnam and Thailand to undermine us by blockading borders and spreading slanderous propaganda, and forcibly occupies our territory. However, Cambodia has not been frightened by them. In order to strengthen international unity, Cambodia resolutely recognized the People's Republic of China. Cambodia also believes that all international organizations and international conferences should have China's participation. All this is beneficial to world peace and is completely in line with the unanimous demands of the Cambodian people and students.

Student representatives and observers from Burma, Sierra Leone, and Indonesia also spoke at today's congress.

    各国学生代表在国际学联代表大会继续发言
　　强烈谴责美帝国主义军事挑衅
    代表们一致指出：民族解放运动已经汇成一股不可抗拒的历史洪流，这股洪流将要把帝国主义从地球上冲刷得干干净净。
    新华社6日讯　今天在国际学联第五届代表大会上发言的代表和观察员一致指出：现在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的各国人民的民族解放运动，已经汇成一股不可抗拒的历史洪流，这股洪流将要把万恶的帝国主义和殖民主义从地球上冲刷得干干净净。
    代表们在今天的大会发言中强烈谴责美国帝国主义干涉中国的内政，在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅。他们指出：台湾是中国的一个省份，是中国领土不可分割的一部分，他们说全世界人民都站在中国这一边，完全支持中国人民解放台湾的斗争。
    在今天的大会上，伊拉克共和国的学生代表穆哈默德·埃尔穆哈就伊拉克人民的英勇斗争向大会作了动人的报告。
    埃尔穆哈指出，伊拉克人民的革命经验再一次证明了帝国主义是纸老虎。他说，帝国主义一向是把伊拉克看成是他们在中东进行侵略活动的最可靠的一个国家，但是伊拉克人民的革命终于粉碎了帝国主义的这个堡垒。这次革命动摇了帝国主义在中东的老根，同时也是阿拉伯民族解放运动的一次伟大的示威。
    他说，帝国主义并不甘心承认他们的失败。就在伊拉克革命的第二天美英军队就占领了黎巴嫩和约旦，他们害怕这些国家的人民也会起来革命，并且企图用武力来推翻革命的伊拉克政府。但是伊拉克革命政府不管外来的疯狂挑衅，坚决地宣布了它的遵守万隆会议原则和同世界各国保持友好关系的政策。结果，革命政府迅速地受到人民的广泛的拥护。帝国主义者又遭到了失败。
    埃尔穆哈指出，伊拉克人民和学生所进行的斗争已经得到成百万人民的支持。而美帝国主义对中东人民的野蛮的侵略暴露了他们是各国人民民族独立和世界和平的死敌。帝国主义和殖民主义是一切罪恶的行为和战争的根源。这些丑恶的东西将来有一天会永远从我们的世界中滚出去。
    埃尔穆哈最后指出，虽然联合国大会紧急特别会议通过决议要美英军队撤出中东，但是他们的军队仍然占据着黎巴嫩和约旦，他说，美国和英国必须立刻把他们的军队从这一地区撤出去。
    埃尔穆哈在报告中表示要加强同各国学生间的团结和合作，特别是同阿拉伯国家学生间的团结，并坚决支持殖民地国家反对殖民主义争取民族独立的斗争。他特别表示伊拉克人民坚决支持中国人民解放台湾的斗争。
    在今天会上发言的四个拉丁美洲的国家，危地马拉、厄瓜多尔、玻利维亚和墨西哥的代表们同声谴责了美国帝国主义在拉丁美洲各国所进行的军事、政治和经济的侵略。他们说，美国佬正在掠夺他们国家的丰富资源，支持人民最痛恨的独裁政府，野蛮地干涉他们国家的内政并摧残这些国家人民的尊严。他们说，古巴的反动独裁统治者正在用美国交给他的武器来屠杀要求独立的古巴人民。
    他们说，但是美帝国主义所有这些野蛮的镇压决不能摧毁拉丁美洲人民的斗争意志和必胜的信念。危地马拉代表塞古拉在发言中说，现在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲已经掀起了巨大的反殖民主义运动，被压迫的人民正在欢欣鼓舞地准备迎接自己解放的日子。他以充满信心的声音宣布说，殖民主义的时代已经破产了。
    来自西非、喀麦隆、北非、阿尔及利亚和黑非洲的代表和观察员，在发言中一致表达了他们同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民团结一起，继续坚定不移地反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的决心。
    阿尔及利亚代表爱特·却拉尔在发言中说我们从自己的切身经验中体会到在殖民主义统治下不可能有真正的民族文化和教育事业的发展。殖民主义枷锁已迫使阿尔及利亚学生觉悟起来，参加民族独立斗争。虽然许多人英勇地牺牲了，成批地学生被关在集中营里，遭受各种酷刑和折磨，但是阿尔及利亚人民和学生将坚持不懈地斗争下去，直到最后的胜利。
    喀麦隆代表约瑟夫·森德向大会报告了喀麦隆学生同殖民主义者进行英勇斗争的情况。约瑟夫·森德说，近几年来喀麦隆人民受尽了法国殖民主义者的抢掠、酷刑和折磨，现在我们人民已经拿起了武器组织游击队来回击法国殖民主义者。喀麦隆学生也英勇地和人民一起参加武装斗争，反对殖民主义者和他们的代理人。我们深信喀麦隆人民不久也好像中国人民革命的胜利一样，一定会战胜殖民主义的统治。
    阿尔巴尼亚学生代表戴柯鲁西在发言中说，美帝国主义正在全世界许多地方制造战争紧张局势，并且不顾全世界人民的反对进行罪恶的核武器试验，美帝国主义的这些罪恶活动，在强大的爱好和平的全世界人民的面前，将一定被彻底粉碎。戴柯鲁西还说，丑恶的殖民主义制度是我们这个时代的耻辱，殖民主义一天不消灭，民族独立一天就不可能实现。社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚的青年和学生在任何情况下，都将永远同情和坚决支持各国人民和学生进行反殖民主义和争取民族独立的斗争。如果有必要，他们可以毫不动摇地拿起武器战斗，不惜自己的生命。
    柬埔寨学生代表在发言中显示了他们敢于蔑视美帝国主义和侵略集团的志气。他说，柬埔寨根据和平共处的原则对外实行中立政策，对内积极发展民族的独立经济，但是这并不是没有困难，美国吓唬我们，它指使南越和泰国用封锁边境和诽谤宣传破坏我们，并且武力侵占我们的领土。但是柬埔寨没有被他们吓倒，柬埔寨为了加强国际间的团结，坚决承认了中华人民共和国。柬埔寨还认为一切国际组织和国际会议都应有中国参加，这一切都是对世界和平有利的，也是完全符合柬埔寨人民和学生的一致要求的。
    缅甸、塞拉勒窝内和印度尼西亚的学生代表和观察员也在今天的大会上作了发言。
