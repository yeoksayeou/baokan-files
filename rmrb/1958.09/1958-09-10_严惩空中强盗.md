　　Severely Punish the Aerial Bandits
　　Su Tianzhong
　　September 8th was the third day after Premier Zhou issued his statement. At an air force airport, rows of "Iron Eagles" gleamed with silver light. Air heroes gathered around the wings, enthusiastically studying tactics, ready to give invading enemies a head-on blow at any time.

　　At 9:50 AM, two batches of sixteen US-made Chiang Kai-shek F-86 jet fighters intruded into the airspace over the Nan'ao Island area, engaging in harassment and sabotage activities. Our heroic pilots, filled with boundless anger, immediately climbed into their cockpits, soaring into the sky in their "Iron Eagles" to punish the enemy.

　　The sky was clear and the waves rolled. Our two flight echelons, led by Wang Baojun and Zhao Dean, deployed in an imposing battle formation. As the first echelon flew over Nan'ao Island, air commander Wang Baojun spotted enemy aircraft at an altitude of over 9,000 meters. He immediately issued the order: "Two aircraft detected, prepare to attack!" Then, he led his wingman, executing a left-banked turn, nimbly following behind the two enemy aircraft, rapidly closing in, shortening the distance, and preparing to open fire. The enemy aircraft panicked and, heedless of their companions, attempted to escape to the east. But Wang Baojun was quick-witted and swift-handed, immediately increasing speed, pursuing fiercely, and then firing a series of meteor-like shells, hitting one enemy aircraft hard.

　　At this time, the second echelon, following behind the first, also discovered six F-86 enemy aircraft stealthily approaching the tail of our first echelon from the upper right. This was a vicious conspiracy by the enemy! But it was immediately seen through by Zhao Dean, the leading aircraft of our second echelon. He immediately issued the order: "Six aircraft detected to the upper right, pay attention to searching, launch the attack!"

　　Zhao Dean's echelon met the enemy aircraft head-on, and the enemy formation, caught by surprise, immediately fell into disarray. One enemy aircraft dived in front of our number four aircraft, Zhang Yilin, who conveniently used his sighting ring to lock onto it, chasing it all the way from an altitude of 9,000 meters to a low altitude of 400-500 meters. At this moment, a dark, towering mountain flashed under Zhang Yilin's wing, and the fishing boats on the sea could be seen clearly. "Take it down right here!" Zhang Yilin, filled with anger, immediately pressed the cannon button hard, and a series of shells bloomed on the enemy aircraft. This "roasting chicken" trailed a long tail of smoke, and fled crookedly towards the sea.

　　The battle ended victoriously. Our agile "war eagles" returned to the airport in an imposing formation. The airport erupted in enthusiastic cheers. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　严惩空中强盗
    苏天中
    9月8日，是周总理发表声明的第三天。我空军某机场上，一列列“铁鹰”闪着银光。空中英雄们围坐在机翼下，热烈地研究着战术，随时准备给进犯的敌人以迎头痛击。
    上午九点五十分，美制蒋军F—86型喷气战斗机两批十六架，窜入南澳岛地区上空，进行骚扰破坏活动。我英勇的飞行员们怀着无比愤怒，立刻跨进座舱，驾着“铁鹰”凌空而起，前去惩罚敌人。
    碧空万里，海浪滔滔。我两个飞行梯队，在王保钧和赵德安率领下，摆开了威严的战斗队形。第一梯队刚刚飞过南澳岛上空，空中指挥员王保钧便在九千多公尺的高空，首先发现了敌机。他立即发出命令：“发现两架，准备攻击！”接着，他率领着自己的僚机，一个左坡度翻转过来，敏捷地跟在这两架敌机后面，迅速地向前逼进，缩短距离，准备开炮攻击。敌机被吓慌了，顾不得他后面的伙伴，企图向东逃脱。可是王保钧眼明手快，马上加大了速度，猛追过去，紧接着就射出一串串流星似的炮弹，狠狠地打在一架敌机身上。
    这时候，跟在第一梯队后面的第二梯队，也发现了右上方有六架F—86型敌机，偷偷地向我第一梯队尾后袭来。这是敌人一个毒辣的阴谋！但是他早被我第二梯队带队长机赵德安一眼看穿了，他当即下达命令：“右上方发现六架，注意搜索，投入攻击！”
    赵德安梯队和敌机编队打了个对头，遭到突然打击的敌机队形马上乱套了。有一架敌机一头插在我四号机张以林的前面，张以林便顺眼用瞄准光环套住了它，一直从九千公尺的高空追到四、五百公尺的低空。此刻，一座黑压压的大山从张以林的机翼下闪过，海面上的渔船也看得清清楚楚了。“就在这里干掉它！”满腔怒火的张以林立刻狠狠地一按炮钮，一串串炮弹便在敌机身上开了花。这个“烧鸡”拖着一条长长的烟尾巴，歪歪斜斜地向大海逃去。
    战斗胜利结束了。我矫健的“战鹰”编着威严的队形返回机场。机场上发出热烈的欢呼声。（新华社）
