Title: Valuable Experience Gained on the Iron and Steel Front: Massively Establish Indigenous Blast Furnaces to Greatly Increase Iron Production; Daily Output in Mid-September Compared to Early September: Iron Increased by 32.1%, Steel Increased by 3.66%; Arduous Efforts Still Needed to Complete the Full Month's Task

Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: In the nationwide movement to fight for iron and steel across the country during mid-September, it is encouraging that the people of the whole country have found a way to make pig iron production leap forward by relying on indigenous blast furnaces, from the high-yield records of pig iron created in Henan Province.

On the 15th, more than 50,000 indigenous blast furnaces in Henan Province demonstrated their power, creating a new record of producing 18,694 tons of pig iron per day (sintered iron not included, same below). The daily output for the next five days continued to be maintained at more than 4,000 tons to more than 8,000 tons, and on the 21st, it leaped to more than 12,000 tons; this is several times to eleven times higher than before the 15th. The high-yield record in Henan Province is a signal, indicating that a national-scale pig iron bumper production movement is about to emerge. Currently, provinces such as Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Sichuan, and Hunan have proposed the grand plan of "Producing 10,000 tons of iron per day to welcome National Day," striving to move towards the goal of "10,000-ton provinces." When it was September 10th, there were only five provinces in the country with a daily pig iron output of more than 1,000 tons: Henan, Hunan, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Guizhou. By the 20th, Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shandong had been newly added to the ranks of "1,000-ton provinces." Moreover, some counties have emerged that have reached or once reached a daily iron output of 1,000 tons, such as Yuxian, Lushan, Baofeng, Linru, Xinyang, Dengfeng, Shangcheng, and Bo'ai in Henan, Lianyuan in Hunan, and Wu'an in Hebei; and a large number of high-yield furnaces have emerged. Those provinces, cities, districts, and counties that were originally weak and relatively backward are also actively preparing to catch up.

In the ten days of mid-September, the national steel output continued to increase compared to the previous ten days. Calculated by the average daily output, iron increased by 32.1%, and steel increased by 3.66%.

As of September 15th, there were more than 116,000 indigenous blast furnaces, more than 2,000 small blast furnaces, and more than 490 small converters put into production nationwide. Since mid-September, the rate of indigenous blast furnaces, small blast furnaces, and small converters being put into production after completion has been rising.

The army fighting on the furnace fronts, mining areas, coal mines, and steel transportation lines across the country has been increasing continuously in these ten days. Thanks to the first secretaries of the Party committees at all levels going to the front line to command and sharing weal and woe with the masses on the production site, the steel warriors are in high spirits, overcoming numerous difficulties to advance. In some southern regions, the continuous rain a few days ago posed a threat to the production of open-air indigenous blast furnaces. People put forward the slogan "Defeat the rain and produce more molten iron," and insisted on production in front of the furnaces despite the autumn wind and rain. In order to solve the difficulty of coke supply, many regions are vigorously summarizing and promoting the experience of using anthracite coal to make iron, and at the same time, relying on the broad masses to set up simple coke ovens and use indigenous methods to make coke.

Today, there are only eight days left in September. What deserves serious attention at present is that although the steel front achieved great results in mid-September, it is still far from the national production plan requirements. To complete the steel production plan for September, especially the steel production plan, more than 18 key steel enterprises in the country and more than 20 million steel troops in various provinces and cities still need to go all out and make extremely arduous struggles in the last few days of September. In these last few days, the positive factors in steel production are: Henan Province has created the experience of increasing pig iron production; dozens of new converters in 18 key steel enterprises will be put into production one after another; and the fact that Party committees at all levels have grasped the leadership of steel production and the implementation of the mass line in the steel production movement is the most fundamental condition.

The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held a telephone conference of responsible persons from key steel enterprises across the country and metallurgical bureaus (departments) of various provinces and cities on the 20th and 21st, instructing all localities to immediately take all emergency measures to strive for a leap forward in steel production in the second half of the month, requiring all key steel enterprises to achieve normal production, and accelerating the construction of converters under construction. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has specially transferred a batch of pig iron from Shijingshan, Henan, Hunan and other places and rushed them to steel mills in Shanghai, Daye, Tianjin, Tangshan and other places overnight. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry called on all provinces, cities, and enterprises to catch up quickly, learn from Henan's experience in pig iron bumper production, and also achieve a leap forward in pig iron production in the second half of September, combining the launching of high-yield "satellites" with large-scale bumper harvests.

### 钢铁战线上获得一条宝贵经验  大办土高炉　大增铁产量  九月中旬日产量同初旬比：铁增32.1％，钢增3.66％，完成全月任务有待艰苦努力

    钢铁战线上获得一条宝贵经验
    大办土高炉　大增铁产量
    九月中旬日产量同初旬比：铁增32.1％，钢增3.66％，完成全月任务有待艰苦努力
    新华社22日讯　9月中旬，在全国各地为钢铁而战的全民运动中，令人振奋的事是，全国人民已经从河南省创造的生铁高产纪录中，找到了一条依靠土高炉使生铁产量向上跃进的道路。
    15日，河南省五万多座土高炉大显威风，创造了日产生铁一万八千六百九十四吨（烧结铁未计入，下同）的新纪录，以后五天的日产量继续保持在四千多吨到八千多吨，至21日又跃进到了一万二千多吨；这比15日以前跃增了数倍到十一倍。河南省的高产纪录是一个信号，预示着一个全国规模的生铁丰产运动即将出现，目前已经有山西、河北、山东、安徽、四川、湖南等省提出“日产万吨铁，迎接国庆节”的宏伟计划，奋力向“万吨省”的目标迈进。当9月10日的时候，全国日产生铁千吨以上的省份，还只有河南、湖南、山西、四川和贵州等五省，到20日，跨进“千吨省”行列的，又已经新增加了江苏、河北和山东；而且还涌现了一些连日达到或一度达到日产千吨铁的县，如河南的禹县、鲁山、宝丰、临汝、信阳、登封、商城、博爱，湖南的涟源，河北的武安等；还涌现了一大批高产炉。而那些原来基础较差、比较落后的省、市、区、县，也都在积极准备赶上来。
    9月中旬的十天里，全国钢铁产量比前十天续有增加。以每天的平均产量计算，铁增长了32.1％，钢增长了3.66％。
    到9月15日为止，全国已经投入生产的土高炉有十一万六千多座，小高炉二千多座，小转炉四百九十多座；自中旬以来，土高炉、小高炉和小转炉建成后投入生产的比率正在上升。
  战斗在各地炉前、采矿场、煤井和钢铁运输线上的大军，在这十天不断有增加。由于各级党委第一书记亲临前线指挥，和群众在生产现场同甘共苦，钢铁战士们斗志十分高昂，冲破重重困难前进。南方有些地区前几天阴雨连绵，露天的土高炉生产面临着威胁，人们提出“战胜雨水，多出铁水”，冒着秋风秋雨在炉前坚持生产。为了解决焦炭供应的困难，许多地区一面大力总结和推广无烟煤炼铁的经验，一面依靠广大群众大办简易焦炉，用土法炼焦。
    到今天，9月份只剩下最后八天了。目前值得提起严重注意的是，中旬钢铁战线上虽然战果很大，但离国家的产量计划要求却还相差很远。完成9月份的钢铁生产计划，特别是钢的生产计划，还有待全国十八个重点钢铁企业和各省、市的两千多万钢铁大军，在九月份的最后几天，全力以赴，作十分艰苦的奋战。在这最后几天中，钢铁生产的积极因素是：河南省已经创造了提高生铁产量的经验；十八个重点钢铁企业的数十个新转炉，将陆续投入生产；而各级党委已经抓紧对钢铁生产的领导和在钢铁生产运动中群众路线的贯彻，则是最根本的条件。
    冶金工业部已经在20日和21日召开了全国重点钢铁企业和各省、市冶金局（厅）负责人的电话会议，指示各地立即采取一切紧急措施，千方百计地力争钢产量在下旬来一个跃进，要求各重点钢铁企业做到正常生产，正在建设的转炉要加速建设；已经建成的转炉要立即投入生产，为此，冶金部已经特地从石景山、河南、湖南等地增调了一批生铁，星夜赶运上海、大冶、天津、唐山等地的炼钢厂。冶金工业部号召各省、市、企业急起直追，学习河南的生铁丰产经验，使生铁产量在9月下旬也来一个跃进，把发射高产“卫星”和大面积丰收结合起来。
