Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 9th: The Communist Party of the United States told reporters that the General Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, Dennis, sent a telegram to U.S. President Eisenhower to protest the U.S. government's aggressive actions in the Taiwan Strait area.

The telegram stated that aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China contain extremely serious dangers of war. "If this policy of war provocation and interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China is not ended soon, a new global war may break out in the Far East."

The telegram said: "Millions of people at home and abroad are worried about the government's shameful warmongering policies and actions. Government officials in many countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe have expressed unease and opposition."

Dennis expressed his support in the telegram for "millions of other Americans who demand non-interference in China's internal affairs and the implementation of a policy of peaceful negotiations." He also requested, on behalf of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, that the U.S. Navy and other forces completely withdraw from Chinese territorial waters and Taiwan, that negotiations with the People's Republic of China be resumed as soon as possible to establish normal diplomatic relations with China, and advocated for the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

Dennis said: "Taking these actions will eliminate the serious danger of disaster in the Far East. These actions will restore our traditional friendly relations with the Chinese people, which is in the interests of the American people."
