　　(News) Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province, which achieved an unprecedented wheat harvest this year, is currently vigorously engaged in deep plowing for winter crops. This prefecture has 14 million mu of land for winter sowing this year, an expansion of 4 million mu compared to last year. On the fields where autumn crops have already been harvested, groups of "deep plowing teams" are using double-share plows, improved deep plows, hoes, and other tools to deeply till the land. As of August 28th, the entire prefecture had deeply plowed over 400,000 mu within a week. Among these, 30,000 mu were deeply plowed to a depth of 1.5 to 5 chi (approximately 0.5 to 1.7 meters), with the remainder being around 1 chi (approximately 0.33 meters).

　　When the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed a plan for all winter-sown land to be deeply plowed to a depth of more than 1 chi, some people said: River land can be deeply plowed, upland cannot be deeply plowed, areas with abundant labor and less land can be deeply plowed, areas with less labor and more land cannot be deeply plowed, and so on. Various counties, in conjunction with studying the typical experiences of high wheat yields this year, launched a major debate. In Zao Yang County alone, 500,000 big-character posters were put up during the debate. During the debate, the masses used examples of this year's abundant wheat harvest to refute the conservatives and defeat the "theory of conditions."

　　襄阳专区驳倒条件论  “深耕队”田间抖威风
    本报讯　今年获得小麦空前丰收的湖北省襄阳专区，目前正在大搞冬播作物深耕。这个专区今年冬播面积有一千四百万亩，比去年扩大四百万亩。在那些秋收作物已经收割的田地上，成群的“深耕队”正用双铧犁、改良深耕犁、镢锄等工具在深翻土地。到8月28日，全区在一周内已经深翻了四十多万亩。其中深翻一尺五寸到五尺的有三万亩，其余都在一尺左右。
    当中共襄阳地委提出所有冬播土地深耕一尺以上规划时，有些人说：河地能深耕，岗地不能深耕，劳力多地少的地区能深耕，劳力少地多的不能深耕等等。各县结合学习今年小麦高产的典型经验，开展了一场大辩论。仅枣阳县在辩论中就贴出大字报五十万张。辩论中，群众运用今年小麦丰产的实例，驳倒了保守派，击败了“条件论”。
