Tan Zhengshi, the supervisory director of the Jintai Cooperative in Yangdu Township, Zhongxian County, had been away from home for four days and four nights. His wife, carrying their child on her back, searched everywhere for him, going to all the neighbors, relatives, friends, and the lime factory where he worked. On the fifth day, as dusk was falling, Tan Zhengshi returned, panting, with a hooked sickle in his hand. Before his wife could speak, he urged, "Quick, get me some food. I haven't eaten all day, and I have to leave again after eating."

It turned out that Old Tan was searching for mineral deposits. In early July of this year, the township Party branch decided to build an iron factory. Knowing that Tan Zhengshi had mined for half a month in a iron factory in Fengdu County after Liberation, they assigned him the task of finding a source of ore. Initially, he found a mineral deposit on Jintai Mountain, but after digging for four days, it disappeared. What should he do? He stood at the entrance of the mine, staring blankly, thinking to himself: In the past, when I hauled coal, worked as a long-term laborer, and burned charcoal, it was all for the landlords and capitalists. I put in the effort, but got nothing in return. Now, building an iron factory is something the entire township's people are doing for themselves. Finding ore is a task assigned to me by the Party. How can I face the Party if I don't complete it?

Tan Zhengshi set off from home for the second time, embarking on a long journey to find ore. He searched along the mountains, heading into the deep mountains. This was a desolate, uninhabited old mountain dense forest. One had to descend hundreds of feet to reach the bottom of the valley, and then climb hundreds of feet to reach the opposite peak. Even hunters rarely came to this area. After walking for seven or eight days, crossing seven large mountains, he reached Shaniuwan, but still hadn't found a trace of mineral deposits. Three large mountains, seven or eight hundred feet high, converged here in a triangle. The mountains were covered in dense pine forests that blocked out the sky, and on either side were cliffs over a hundred feet high. He searched for ore in these desolate mountains, eating corn cakes to satisfy his hunger, drinking water from the river when thirsty, and resting on the grass when tired. One day, just as he lay down, a tiger began roaring on the mountain to his left, its roar echoing between the mountains, shaking the entire valley.

He drilled into the deep mountain valleys for another three days and three nights. One day, he found a cave in a deep ravine. He took off his clothes, crawled into the cave, and shone his flashlight around. He dug out a stone the size of an egg, which felt heavy in his hand. He looked at it again and again, and it seemed like iron ore, but not quite. To get to the bottom of it, Tan Zhengshi immediately crawled out of the cave, ran down to a household at the foot of the mountain to borrow a hoe, and dug for over an hour in one go, unearthing a large ore weighing thirty or forty pounds. He was overjoyed and couldn't help but laugh out loud: "Ha, I've finally found you!"

    深山探宝
    方本良
    忠县洋渡乡金台社的监察主任谭正诗，四天四夜没回家了，他爱人背起娃娃到处找，把左邻右舍、亲戚朋友和他工作的石灰厂都找遍了，第五天擦黑的时候，谭正诗却拿着个钩钩刀，气喘喘地回来了。没等他爱人开口，就催着说：“快弄饭，我一天没吃了，吃过饭还要走哩。”
    老谭原来是在找矿苗。今年7月初，乡党总支决定办一个铁厂，知道只有谭正诗解放后在酆都县铁厂里采过半月矿，就把寻找矿源的任务交给了他。起初他在金台山上找到一处矿苗，挖了四天，却没有了。怎么办呢？他站在洞口发呆，心里暗自想着：我过去拖煤炭，当长工，烧钢炭，都是给地主资本家干的，自己出了力没有份，现在开铁厂是全乡人民自己办的，找矿是党交给自己的任务，不完成对得起党吗？
    谭正诗第二次从家里出发，开始了远征探矿。他从沿着山脉向深山找去，这是一片荒无人烟的老山密林，要下几百丈才到沟底，再上几百丈才到对面的山顶，这一带连打猎的人也很少。走了七、八天，翻过七座大山，到了杀牛塆，还没有发现矿苗的影子。三座七、八百丈高的大山，在这里汇合成个三角形，山上是密得看不见天的松树林，两边是一百多丈高的悬岩。他在这漫无人烟的大山里找矿，饿了就吃麦粑粑充饥，渴了就在河沟里喝水，疲劳了就在草地上休息。有一天，他刚一躺下，老虎就在左边山上咻咻地吼叫起来，吼声在几座山间应来应去，整个山沟都震动了。
    他在深山沟里一连又钻三天三夜。有一天他在一个深塆里找到了一个岩洞，他脱了衣服钻进洞里，用电筒照起，刨出了鸡蛋大一个石头，拿在手里重重的，他看了又看，又像铁矿石，又不太像。为了弄个究竟，谭正诗马上钻出洞，跑到山下的人户借来了锄头，一气挖了个多钟头，挖出了三、四十斤一个大矿石。他高兴极了，不禁笑出声来：“哈，总算找到你了！”
