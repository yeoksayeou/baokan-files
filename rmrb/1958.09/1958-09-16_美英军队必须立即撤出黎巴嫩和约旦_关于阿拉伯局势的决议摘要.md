Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The following is a summary of the resolution on the Arab situation adopted by the Fifth Congress of the International Union of Students:

The Fifth Congress of the International Union of Students is deeply concerned about the situation in the Middle East. Recently, the situation has become even more serious due to the aggression of Lebanon and Jordan by U.S. and British imperialism, violating the national sovereignty of these two countries. Faced with the increasingly surging national liberation movement in the Arab East, they desperately attempted to save the pro-imperialist and reactionary regimes of these countries and to stifle the young Republic of Iraq, thereby seriously threatening peace in the region and the world.

The students and people of the Arab East immediately stood up against the invaders.

The voices of indignant protest against this aggression have resounded throughout the world.

The Congress believes that the instability and constant tension in this region are due to the imperialist policies of attempting to plunder the national resources of this region, crush national liberation movements, and prepare for world war.

Recently, the students and people of Iraq defeated imperialism and established a peace-loving republic, dealing a fatal blow to the Baghdad Pact. This is a historic victory for the Arab people and a major contribution to the cause of peace and the stability of this region.

The Fifth Congress of the International Union of Students:

— Strongly condemns the U.S. and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, fully supports the heroic struggle of the students of Lebanon and Jordan, and demands the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and British troops;

— Attaches importance to the role of Arab students in the struggle against imperialism and for the independence and sovereignty of their homelands, and appreciates the work done by the Executive Committee of the International Union of Students to fully support Arab students;

— Welcomes the great victory of the students and people of Iraq and the establishment of the Republic of Iraq; and pays tribute to the member organization of the International Union of Students, the General Union of Students in Iraq, which led the struggle of Iraqi students and thus contributed to the liberation of their homeland; supports the struggle of Iraqi students to consolidate their victory;

— Affirms the legitimate right of Palestinian Arab refugees to return to their homeland, which will help to resolve the Palestinian issue and ease tensions in the Middle East.

— Calls on students and their organizations around the world to support the struggle of Arab students and people through all possible forms of assistance;

— Instructs the Executive Committee of the International Union of Students to further support the students of the Arab East morally and materially, to publicize their struggle as widely as possible, and to develop close ties with student organizations in this region.

    美英军队必须立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦
    关于阿拉伯局势的决议摘要
    新华社15日讯　国际学联第五届代表大会通过的关于阿拉伯局势的决议（摘要）
    国际学联第五届代表大会十分关切中东的局势。最近，由于美英帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，侵犯了这两个国家的国家主权，局势更加严重了。它们面对着日益高涨的阿拉伯东方民族解放运动，绝望地企图挽救这些国家的亲帝反动政权，扼杀年轻的伊拉克共和国，从而严重地威胁了这个地区和世界的和平。
    阿拉伯东方的学生和人民立刻站起来反对侵略者。
    反对这次侵略的义愤的抗议的呼声响遍了全世界。
    大会认为这个地区的不稳定和不断紧张的局势是由于帝国主义企图掠夺这个地区的国家资源，粉碎民族解放运动和准备世界战争的政策引起的。
    最近伊拉克学生和人民战胜了帝国主义，建立了热爱和平的共和国，给巴格达条约以致命的打击。这是阿拉伯人民历史性的胜利，是对和平事业和这个地区的稳定的一大贡献。
    国际学联第五届代表大会：
    ——强烈谴责美英对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略，完全支持黎巴嫩和约旦学生的英勇斗争，要求美英军队立即撤退；
    ——重视阿拉伯学生在反对帝国主义、争取祖国的独立和主权的斗争中的作用，并赞许国际学联执委会为了全力支持阿拉伯学生所作的工作；
    ——欢迎伊拉克学生和人民的伟大胜利和伊拉克共和国的成立；并向国际学联会员组织——伊拉克全国学生总会致敬，它领导了伊拉克学生的斗争，从而对他们祖国的解放作出了贡献；支持伊拉克学生为巩固他们的胜利的斗争；
    ——确认巴勒斯坦阿拉伯难民返回他们的故乡的合法权利，这将有助于巴勒斯坦问题的解决和缓和中东紧张局势。
    ——号召全世界学生及其组织通过一切可能的支援形式，支持阿拉伯学生和人民的斗争；  
    ——责成国际学联执委会进一步从道义上，物质上支持阿拉伯东方的学生，尽可能广泛地宣传他们的斗争，并发展与这一地区的学生组织的紧密联系。
