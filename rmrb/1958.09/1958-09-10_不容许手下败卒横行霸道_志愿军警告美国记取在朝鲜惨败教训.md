Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th: The broad masses of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV), in recent days, have been enthusiastically holding meetings to support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement, angrily warning the U.S. aggressors to remember the bitter lessons of defeat in the Korean War and to refrain from playing with fire to their own destruction.

　　At a meeting held by the CPV leadership on the afternoon of the 7th, officers and soldiers from generals to privates were filled with indignation, shouting in unison: "Allowing defeated foes no room for rampage!" "The American paper tiger is not allowed to interfere in our internal affairs and occupy our territory of Taiwan." Major General Wang Yunrui said at the meeting: If the U.S. imperialists dare to disregard the solemn warnings of our people, and brazenly use military threats to interfere in our internal affairs, and impose war on our people, we will certainly give them an even more disastrous blow. Representatives of the artillery units that had severely battered the U.S. aggressor army stated: Wherever the motherland needs us, we will go there, and resolutely join the people of the whole country to contribute our strength to defend and liberate the sacred territory of the motherland and build a great socialist motherland.

　　At large and small meetings held in various units, officers and soldiers used their personal experiences to warn the U.S. aggressors not to play with fire to their own destruction. At a thousand-person meeting held by a certain unit, Captain Yao Changji, commander of the Second-Class Hero Company, said that in the summer counterattack of 1953, the Eighth Company captured a high ground held by the U.S. aggressor army in five minutes, and on the newly occupied high ground, repelled twenty-three enemy counterattacks, killing and wounding more than a thousand enemies. He said: If the U.S. imperialists are not forgetful, they should immediately withdraw their claws and stop military provocations. Officers and soldiers of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, a Second-Class Merit Citation Company that shot down fifteen U.S. aircraft in ten days during the Battle of Shangganling, unanimously stated at a forum that they would maintain their honor of being loyal to the motherland, loyal to the cause of peace, and of striking at the aggressors. They will immediately take action and be ready at any time to severely strike any enemy who dares to launch a war of aggression against our country.

　　不容许手下败卒横行霸道
　　志愿军警告美国记取在朝鲜惨败教训
    据新华社平壤8日电　中国人民志愿军广大官兵，连日来纷纷集会热烈拥护周恩来总理的声明，愤怒警告美国侵略者记取在朝鲜战争中的惨败教训，休得玩火自焚。
    在志愿军领导机关7日下午举行的大会上，从将军到士兵群情激愤，同声高呼：“不容许手下败卒横行霸道！”“不容许美国纸老虎干涉我国内政，霸占我国领土台湾。”王蕴瑞少将在会上说：如果美帝国主义胆敢不顾我国人民的严正警告，悍然以军事威胁干涉我国内政，把战争强加在我国人民头上，我们一定给它更惨重的打击。曾沉重打击过美国侵略军的炮兵部队代表表示：祖国需要我们到哪里，我们就到哪里，坚决与全国人民一道，为保卫和解放祖国神圣的领土，建设伟大的社会主义祖国而贡献自己的力量。
    在各部队举行的大小集会上，官兵们纷纷以自己的亲身经历，警告美国侵略者不要玩火自焚。某部举行的千人大会上，二级英雄连连长姚长纪上尉谈，1953年夏季反击战中，第八连五分钟攻占了美国侵略军据守的一个高地，并在新占领的高地上，击退敌人二十三次反扑，杀伤敌人一千多人。他说：如果美帝国主义不健忘的话，应该立即缩回魔爪，停止军事挑衅。曾在上甘岭战役中，十天击落美机十五架的某高射炮部队二等功臣连的官兵，在座谈会上一致表示，要保持忠于祖国，忠于和平事业，打击侵略者的荣誉，立即行动起来，随时准备痛击胆敢向我国发动侵略战争的敌人。
