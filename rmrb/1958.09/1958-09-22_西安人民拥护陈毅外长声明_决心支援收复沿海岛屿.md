Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 21st. More than 1.1 million people from all walks of life in Xi'an warmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and angrily condemn Dulles' shameless slander at the UN General Assembly.

　　Today, more than 150,000 workers from more than 100 factories, after reading Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement in the newspaper, held discussions and wrote letters to the newspaper, expressing their determination to fight to the end for the recovery of Jinmen and Mazu. Workers at the Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory proposed to guarantee the over-fulfillment of the September production target and use practical actions to support the struggle to liberate Jinmen and Mazu. Workers Feng Yunxin and Li Baocheng said angrily, "Dulles is utterly shameless. It is clear that they have occupied our territory of Taiwan and sent warships to obstruct our recovery of Jinmen, Mazu, and other islands, yet they slander us as 'aggressors.' This is complete nonsense." Ke Yingming, the earthwork team leader of the Xi'an Steel Plant, said, "Our determination to recover Jinmen and Mazu cannot be shaken by any force. Our entire earthwork team will definitely work twice as hard to guarantee steel production this National Day to support the struggle to recover the coastal islands."

　　Commune members in the suburbs are determined to counter the American aggressors with actions to improve the autumn harvest and autumn planting. The militiamen of the sixteen militia companies of the Dongfeng People's Commune vowed to master military technology in the shortest possible time and respond to the call of the motherland at any time.

　　Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xi'an and teachers and students of Jiaotong University, Northwest University, Northwest University of Technology, and other schools also gathered to angrily denounce Dulles' shameless slander at the United Nations General Assembly. Responsible persons of local organizations of the China Democratic League, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic National Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and the Jiusan Society, as well as various people's organizations, also issued statements one after another, warmly supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and sternly condemning Dulles' shameless clamor at the UN General Assembly.
