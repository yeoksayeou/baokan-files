Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, 16th. The broad masses of farmers, salt workers, fishermen, and boatmen in the Fujian frontline area, while vigorously supporting the frontline, braved the Kuomintang bandit army's artillery attacks and launched a vigorous mass production movement. They are determined to use practical actions such as strengthening the struggle against the enemy, increasing the production of more grain, vegetables, fish, and salt, and transporting more goods to fully support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and thoroughly smash the military provocations of U.S. imperialism.

In recent days, angered by the crimes of U.S. imperialism in carrying out military provocations and the Kuomintang bandit army's mad bombardment of our peaceful residents, the working people of Xiamen, Daxiaodeng Island, and coastal areas such as Tong'an and Nan'an have all been mobilized and organized. They have put forward the fighting slogan of "Production teams are also support-the-front teams, achieving a double harvest in production and support, and never stopping until the Kuomintang bandits are eliminated." On one hand, they are actively supporting the People's Liberation Army in fiercely attacking the enemy. On the other hand, they have built a large number of air raid and anti-artillery facilities called "production caves" and "leap forward caves" in the fields, salt marshes, docks, and boats. They adopted methods such as taking the caves as home and decentralizing operations, producing at night when there is artillery fire during the day, producing during the day when there is artillery fire at night, working hard when there is no fire, continuing to work when there is light fire, and persisting in production as usual. They only run into the nearby "production caves" to smoke, rest, and read newspapers when enemy shells fly over. As soon as the artillery fire stops, they immediately wave their hoes and salt shovels in twos and threes and become active in the fields and salt fields, continuing production and replanting crops damaged by enemy shells. They also pick up shrapnel in the fields and hand it over to relevant departments for steelmaking or remelting into more shells to fiercely counterattack the enemy. The agricultural cooperative members of Hecuo and Wutong townships, located on the front line of Xiamen Island facing Jinmen Island across the sea, not only basically eliminated the third-class fields of late rice amidst the hail of bullets, but also accumulated hundreds of thousands of dan of fertilizer, moving towards the goal of improving first- and second-class fields and achieving 10,000 jin per mu of late rice. After some rice fields were damaged by artillery shells, they adopted the method of moving hillocks and transplanting seedlings to replant, and changed the empty rice fields to grow vegetables to supply the needs of the troops nearby. Encouraged by the victory news of our army severely punishing the Kuomintang bandit army, the Haifang Salt Industry Cooperative in Yanshan Township, Tong'an County, also enthusiastically launched a technical innovation movement and created many advanced production methods, increasing salt production by more than double compared to the same period last year. At the same time, it broke the usual practice of summer weather being hot, salt crystallizing quickly, seawater having many impurities, and mostly producing only second- and third-class salt, and produced a large batch of first-class salt, which is continuously supplied for industrial and edible needs. Now they are working day and night amidst the hail of bullets together with the members of the surrounding salt industry cooperatives, determined to produce more than 100,000 dan of salt on the basis of achieving a leap forward plan of producing more than 40,000 dan of edible salt in September to support industrial and agricultural production.

Fishermen and boatmen, who often suffer from the crazy attacks of Kuomintang bandit warships and artillery fire under the protection of American warships, and have serious difficulties in maintaining maritime production and transportation, have also carried forward their heroic and tenacious spirit and insisted on maritime production and transportation. The fishermen of Hecuo Township, standing on the forefront of Xiamen Island, even created the highest record of oyster production per mu in the country amidst the sound of artillery fire. The Lianxing wooden sailboat transportation cooperative on Daxiaodeng Island, which has persisted in maritime transportation under any circumstances and has been repeatedly praised and rewarded by relevant departments and troops, now has routes that are not only not shortened due to the Kuomintang bandit army's blockade and attacks, but are four times longer than the original ones. They said: The enemy's ferocity has strengthened our determination to persist in production and support the People's Liberation Army in fiercely attacking the enemy. In the future, we must also open up routes to all the ports of Taiwan.

    炮火挡不住英雄人民的干劲
    福建前线地区生产支前双丰收
    新华社厦门16日电　福建前线地区广大农民、盐民、渔民和船民在大力做好支援前线工作的同时，冒着蒋贼军炮火袭击，热火朝天地掀起一个大生产运动，决心用加强对敌斗争、增产更多的粮、菜、鱼、盐和运输更多的货物等实际行动，全力支援人民解放军解放台湾，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的军事挑衅。
    近日来，被美帝国主义进行军事挑衅和蒋贼军疯狂地轰击我和平居民的罪行激怒了的厦门，大、小嶝岛和同安、南安等沿海地区的劳动人民都全部动员和组织起来，提出了“是生产队也是支前队，生产支前两丰收，不灭蒋贼不罢休”的战斗口号，一面积极支援人民解放军痛击敌人，一面在田间、盐坎、码头和船只上修建了大批叫做“生产洞”、“跃进洞”的防空防炮设备。采用以洞为家和化整为零，白天打炮晚上生产，晚上打炮白天生产，大打休息、不打大干、小打继续干等办法照常坚持生产，仅在敌人炮弹飞来时才跑进就近的“生产洞”里去抽烟、休息和读报。炮火一停，他们马上又三三两两的挥舞着锄头和盐铲活跃在田间和盐场上，继续进行生产和补种被敌人炮弹打坏了的庄稼，并顺手捡起田间的弹片，交给有关部门去炼钢或回炉熔制更多的炮弹，狠狠地回击敌人。和金门岛隔海相对的厦门岛前沿何厝、五通等乡农业社社员在炮火纷飞中，不但基本消灭了晚稻三类田，同时还积制了数十万担肥料，向提高一、二类田和实现晚稻万斤乡的目标迈进；有的稻田被炮弹打坏后，他们就采用移丘并秧的办法进行补种，把空出的稻田改种蔬菜，就近供应部队对蔬菜的需要。同安县盐山乡海防盐业社在我军严惩蒋贼军的胜利消息鼓舞下，也热烈开展技术革新运动，创造了许多先进生产方法，使盐产量比去年同期提高一倍以上，同时还打破了夏季天气热、结盐快、海水杂质多、大多只能生产二、三等盐的惯例，生产了大批一等盐，源源供应工业和食用需要。现在他们正和周围各盐业社社员一起，在炮火纷飞中日夜苦战，决心在实现9月份生产食盐四万多担的跃进计划的基础上，多生产十多万担的盐，来支援工农业生产。
    由于常常遭受美国军舰庇护下的蒋贼军舰艇和炮火的疯狂袭击，要坚持海上生产和交通运输有着严重困难的渔民和船民，也发扬了英勇顽强的精神，坚持海上生产和运输。屹立在厦门岛最前沿的何厝乡渔民，在炮火声中，还创造了全国牡蛎亩产量最高纪录。在任何情况下，都坚持海上交通运输，屡次受到有关部门和部队表扬和奖励的大、小嶝岛上的联星木帆船运输合作社，现有的航线不但不因蒋贼军的封锁和袭击而缩短，反而比原有的延长四倍以上。他们说：敌人的凶残，更加强了我们坚持生产和支援解放军痛击敌人的决心，我们将来还一定要把航线一直开辟到台湾各个港口去。
