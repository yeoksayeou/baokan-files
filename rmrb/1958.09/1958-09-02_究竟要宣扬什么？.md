　　What Exactly Should Be Promoted?
    "The Footsteps of Youth" is a vile film.

    The film focuses on depicting the sinister face of a bourgeois high-ranking rogue (Peng Ke), but does not offer a deep criticism of him.

    What is perplexing is: that seemingly promising young man, Xiao Ping, eventually falls in love with that frivolous and capricious woman, Mei Lan. What exactly does Xiao Ping love about her? Are the writers and directors attempting to prove the magic of "beauty" to the broad masses of young people? Are the writers and directors attempting to make the broad masses of young people unconditionally bow down at the feet of those "beauties" with filthy hearts? Besides this, what other issue are the writers and directors attempting to illustrate?

　　究竟要宣扬什么？
    “青春的脚步”是一部丑恶的影片。
    影片着重地描写了资产阶级高级流氓（彭珂）的阴险面目，但没有对他进行深刻的批判。
    使人不解的是：那个看来似乎很有为的青年——萧平最后又去爱上了那个轻浮任性的女人——美兰。萧平爱她的究竟是什么？编导人员是否企图向广大青年证明“貌美”的魔力？编导人员是否企图使广大青年无条件地去拜倒在那些内心肮脏的“美女”的脚下？除了这一点，编导人员究竟还企图说明一个什么问题呢？
