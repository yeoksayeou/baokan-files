Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: Following serious warnings from the Chinese and Soviet governments regarding the United States’ arrogant acts of aggression in the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. authorities are further engaging in conspiracies. On one hand, they are pre-emptively creating public opinion to shift the responsibility for sabotaging the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks onto the Chinese people. On the other hand, they are continuing to deploy troops and equipment in the Taiwan Strait, frantically engaging in war preparations.

White House Press Secretary Hagerty announced on September 21st at Eisenhower's Newport, Rhode Island, villa that the U.S. State Department would release a policy statement on the Taiwan Strait situation this week. Hagerty indicated that this statement would be a sophistical response to the accusations and warnings made by Khrushchev in his September 16th letter to Eisenhower, and would reiterate the U.S.’s aggressive stance. Eisenhower and Dulles are currently discussing and drafting this statement. According to United Press International reporter Hans Leiser, senior U.S. officials believe that Eisenhower and Dulles decided to issue this official statement again because the U.S.’s “attitude on the Taiwan Strait situation has not been fully understood at home and abroad.” The U.S. government is now "stepping up efforts to mobilize domestic and international public opinion to support the U.S.'s policy of 'not retreating in the Formosa (Taiwan) crisis.'" This means forcing as many people as possible to follow the U.S.'s dangerous policy of playing with fire by insisting on and expanding aggression.

Based on this sinful stance, the U.S. is making preparations to sabotage the Sino-U.S. talks. According to American newspapers, the U.S. will insist on its absurd "ceasefire" demand in the current Warsaw talks. At the same time, the U.S. government is using American propaganda outlets to heavily promote that China's just position in the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks – upholding sovereignty and territorial integrity, and opposing U.S. interference in internal affairs – is "completely unacceptable." Due to the firm attitude of China and the Soviet Union, the prospects for the talks are "pessimistic." Washington officials are also openly and shamelessly threatening, through the mouths of American journalists, that after Eisenhower's rude rejection of Khrushchev's letter, the next action in the Taiwan Strait "crisis" should be taken by China or the Soviet Union, and that "war or peace will depend directly on" China and the Soviet Union.

Clearly anticipating that it will be absolutely impossible to force the Chinese people to accept the proposition of tolerating U.S. aggression and undermining territorial sovereignty in the Sino-U.S. talks, the U.S. authorities are now actively planning to submit the issue to the United Nations immediately after sabotaging the Sino-U.S. talks. They are conspiring to use the name of the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs and to bind some of America's allies to the U.S.'s war chariot to share the disastrous consequences of U.S. aggression. After Dulles stated at the UN General Assembly on September 18 that he was prepared to submit the issue to the United Nations, Assistant Secretary of State Wilcox said on September 21 that "in another week or so, we can begin to see" "whether any progress will be made" in the Sino-U.S. talks. If there is no progress by then, "we reserve the right to submit the issue to the United Nations." He said that the U.S. would continue to advocate for a "ceasefire" in the United Nations. According to American news agencies, the U.S. expects that doing so will "reduce some of the burden on the United States." To achieve the aim of using the United Nations to cover up its naked aggression, the U.S. is already using pressure behind the scenes on many countries. According to United Press International, Dulles has privately threatened foreign representatives at the United Nations, saying that if the U.S. does not receive the support of UN member states this time, then it "cannot expect the U.S." to support the United Nations again.

At the same time, the U.S. is continuing to intensify its war threats against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area and is nervously carrying out various military deployments. Senior U.S. generals are gathering in Taipei to plan war conspiracies. On September 22, the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, Felt, the Commander of the Pacific Air Force, Carter, the Taiwan "Defense" Commander, Smoot, the Commander of the Seventh Fleet, Beakley, and the Commander of the Thirteenth Air Force, Moolman, gathered in Taipei to hold a "strategic" conference. These U.S. generals then held talks with military officials of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The previous day, Felt held lengthy talks with Smoot, Beakley, and others.

According to American news agencies, American "Matador" missile launch personnel who have been transferred to Taiwan are already on 24-hour alert. Radar personnel belonging to the U.S. 17th Tactical Missile Air Force Squadron have been stationed on the Penghu Islands, performing their duties day and night. The U.S. military is also rushing to repair Nike-Hercules missile launch sites in Taiwan. Ignoring repeated warnings from the Chinese government, U.S. warships have repeatedly covered Chiang Kai-shek's naval vessels transporting munitions and supplies to Jinmen, including 155mm heavy artillery and other "new weapons." Not only that, but senior U.S. officials also threatened on September 20 that they would send U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek aircraft to bomb the mainland when "necessary."

These actions of the U.S. aggressors once again prove the solemn condemnation issued by Foreign Minister Chen Yi in his statement on September 20, which is that the U.S.’s actions “cannot but make people doubt how much sincerity the U.S. has in the Sino-U.S. talks;” and that the military provocations and war threats that the U.S. is currently carrying out against the Chinese people "are the most pressing danger in the current situation in the Taiwan Strait."

    加紧玩弄政治阴谋　疯狂策划侵略战争
    美国假谈判真侵略的凶相毕露
    阴谋破坏中美会谈利用联合国干涉中国内政
    新华社22日讯　在中国和苏联两国政府对美国在台湾海峡地区狂妄的侵略行动连续发出严重警告以后，美国当局正在进一步玩弄阴谋，一面预先制造舆论，企图把它破坏中美大使级会谈的责任转嫁于中国人民；一面继续在台湾海峡地区调兵遣将，疯狂地进行战争部署。
    白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂21日在艾森豪威尔的罗得岛新港别墅中宣布，美国国务院将在本周内发表一项关于台湾海峡局势的政策声明。哈格蒂表明，这个声明将要针对着赫鲁晓夫9月16日给艾森豪威尔的信中所提出的指责和警告进行狡辩，并重申美国的侵略立场。目前艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯正在商谈拟订这项声明。据合众国际社记者汉斯莱报道，美国高级官员认为，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯所以决定要再次发表这个官方声明，是为美国在台湾海峡局势问题上“所持的态度并没有得到国内外的充分理解”，美国政府现在“正在加紧努力动员国内外的舆论支持美国的‘不在福摩萨（台湾）危机中退却’的政策”。这就是说，要迫使尽可能多的人追随美国坚持和扩大侵略的玩火政策。
    根据这种罪恶的立场，美国正在为破坏中美会谈预作准备。据美国报纸透露，美国在目前的华沙会谈中将坚持它荒谬的“停火”要求。同时，美国官方通过美国宣传机关大事宣传：中国在中美大使级会谈中所采取的维护主权和领土完整、反对美国干涉内政的正义立场是“完全不能接受的”；由于中苏两国的坚定态度，会谈前途“悲观”。华盛顿官员并且通过美国记者的嘴巴公然无耻地威胁说，在艾森豪威尔粗暴地拒绝接受赫鲁晓夫信件以后，台湾海峡“危机”中的下一个行动应当由中国或苏联作出，“是和是战将直接取决于”中国和苏联。
    显然预计到要在中美会谈中迫使中国人民接受容忍美国侵略和破坏领土主权完整的主张是绝对办不到的，美国当局现在积极策划在破坏中美会谈之后，立即把问题提交联合国，阴谋利用联合国的名义来干涉中国内政，并且把美国的一些盟国绑在美国的战车上，来分担美国侵略行动的灾难性后果。在杜勒斯9月18日在联合国大会上表示准备把问题提交联合国以后，美国助理国务卿威耳科克斯21日又发表谈话说，“再过一星期左右就可以开始看到”中美会谈“是否会取得任何进展”，如果到那时没有进展“我们保留把这个问题提交联合国的权利”，他说，在联合国中美国将继续主张“停火”。据美国通讯社透露，美国预期这样做会“使美国减轻一些负担”。为了达到利用联合国来掩盖它赤裸裸的侵略的目的，美国已经在幕后对许多国家使用压力。据合众国际社报道，杜勒斯已经私下向联合国的外国代表威胁说：如果美国这一次得不到联合国会员国的支持，那么也就“不能期望美国”再来支持联合国。
    与此同时，美国正在继续加强它在台湾海峡地区对中国人民的战争威胁并且紧张地进行各种军事部署。美国高级将领云集台北，策划战争阴谋，22日，美国太平洋地区部队总司令费耳特、太平洋空军司令卡特、台湾“防御”司令斯摩特、第七舰队司令比克利、第十三航空队司令穆尔曼等人在台北集合，举行了“战略”会议，这些美国将领随后同蒋介石集团的军事官员举行了会谈。前一天，费耳特同斯摩特、比克利等人举行了长时间会谈。
    据美国通讯社消息，已经调到台湾的美国“斗牛士”式导弹发射人员已经处于二十四小时不断警戒状态中。属于美国第十七战术导弹空军中队的雷达人员已经进驻澎湖列岛，昼夜不停地执行任务。美国军队还在台湾赶修奈克—赫尔克里士导弹发射场。美国军舰不顾中国政府的一再警告，已经多次掩护蒋介石集团军舰运送军火给养到金门，其中包括一百五十五毫米口径的重型大炮和其他一些“新式武器”。不仅如此，美国高级官员20日还扬言“必要”时要出动美蒋飞机来轰炸大陆。
    美国侵略者的这些行径再一次证明了陈毅外长9月20日声明中对它发出的严正谴责，这就是美国的所作所为“不能不使人怀疑美国对于中美谈判究竟有多少诚意”；而目前美国坚持对中国人民进行的军事挑衅和战争威胁，“是目前台湾海峡局势中最迫切的危险”。
