    Everyone expresses their determination, the old man takes the stage and speaks clearly: "Don't think I'm old with white hair, I'm full of energy when it comes to fighting wolves!"
                      (Li Wanguo, Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant)
    You were just discharged from the hospital on the Korean battlefield, your head hit the pyramid and the blood had just been wiped dry. You played with fire in the Middle East and were half-burned to death. Now you've come to Mount Tai to stir up trouble. I ask you! Do you want to live or not?　(You Guotai, Qijiawan, Huangpi, Hubei)
    For the happiness of the people, I labor by the machine, sweat soaking my old military uniform. If the American imperialists dare to invade – I am willing to shed blood on the battlefield once again!　　　　　　　　　(Xiao Ling, transferred soldier, Zhengzhou, Henan)
    American devils, don't come and show off to us, let me tell you a few words in the language of farmers: You are like a pheasant wearing a hat, you can't pretend to be an eagle; you're like a dung beetle flying onto a millstone, you can't be a donkey no matter what; you're like a rabbit pulling a cart, you can't pretend to be a horse, even if you use all your strength, you can't pull it. Everyone in the streets and alleys is angry and discussing it, saying that you are overestimating yourself and being a reckless fool. If you anger our 600 million people and we all rise up to beat you, then you'll die in the middle of the night and you won't dare wait until dawn.
              (Li Jingduo, Tenth Production Team, China-Czechoslovakia Friendship Farm)

    怒火集
    人人个个表决心，老头儿上台说分明：“别看我发白年纪老，打起狼来混身是劲！”
                      （北京汽车制造厂李万国）
    在朝鲜战场你才出了院，头碰金字塔血刚擦干，中东玩火你烧得半死，如今又到泰山头上来动土，问你呵！还想活不想活？　（湖北黄陂祁家湾游国太）
    为了人民的幸福我劳动在机器旁，汗水湿透了我的旧军装。美帝胆敢来侵犯——我愿再一次流血在疆场！　　　　　　　　　（河南郑州转业军人霄凌）
    美国鬼不要向我们乱逞能，说几句庄稼话儿给你听：你好比野鸡戴帽，充不成鹰；你屎克郎飞到磨道上，要想当驴万不能；你好比兔子驾辕，装不成马，胡碰乱撞用出你吃奶劲儿也拉不动。大街小巷人人愤怒纷纷来谈论，都说你自不量力横行霸道是个浑虫。惹恼我六亿人民一齐起来把你揍，到那时，要叫你半夜就死你也不敢到天明。
              （中捷友谊农场第十生产队李景铎）
