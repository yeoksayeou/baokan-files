Chongqing, September 4th (reporting from our newspaper) - The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has increased steel production by more than 50% by enlarging existing open-hearth furnaces. This is the most effective way to rapidly increase steel production with minimal expense and time.

The method used by the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company to enlarge open-hearth furnaces involves extending and raising the steel frame during furnace overhauls, without altering the furnace bottom. The slope is increased, and other parts are appropriately adjusted and modified. This deepens the furnace hearth and increases the volume, allowing for more steel to be produced. The two furnaces in the small open-hearth furnace workshop were originally designed for a capacity of twenty tons. After being slightly enlarged last year, each furnace produced thirty tons of steel. Many workers and engineering technicians felt that the furnaces had even greater potential. In early August of this year, they took advantage of a major furnace overhaul to enlarge them again. The average steel production per furnace increased to forty-five tons, with a maximum of fifty-one tons. Furnace output increased by more than 50% compared to before the enlargement, and more than doubled the original design standard.

To ensure the fastest possible increase in steel production, the company is currently using the major overhaul of large open-hearth furnaces to enlarge two furnaces from their current capacity of ninety tons per furnace to one hundred and fifty tons. This will triple the original design capacity of fifty tons. After these two large open-hearth furnaces are enlarged in mid-September, they will produce more than 40,000 tons of additional steel from late September to the end of the year.

The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's steel production target for this year is double the actual production figure from last year. In addition to building a new batch of converters, which will soon be put into production, the company mainly relies on tapping the potential of existing equipment. Enlarging the furnaces is the primary method. Because the furnace bottom remains untouched and the modification is combined with a major overhaul, the time required is very short. It generally takes only eight to ten days to modify an open-hearth furnace, allowing it to produce an additional ten to fifty tons of steel. If two such fifty-ton open-hearth furnaces were newly built, it would take at least a year from design to construction before they could be put into production. The investment would be approximately 10 million yuan. (The investment for the two new open-hearth furnaces built by the Chongqing Steel Plant in 1952 was more than 11 million yuan.) Currently, after the furnaces are enlarged, the production capacity is increased by fifty tons, while the investment is only 2 million yuan. As the production capacity of the furnaces expands, the cost per ton of steel is reduced by approximately 19 yuan. Based on the planned production of 245,000 tons for these two open-hearth furnaces this year, the cost reduction for the whole year will be 4.6 million yuan. Engineers at the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company told reporters that, based on their experience, the safety factor in the design of general open-hearth furnaces is very high, and they can all be enlarged. In addition, the two-step charging method created by Zhang Wenjin, an advanced steelmaking worker at the company, involves adding molten iron again just before tapping the steel, which can further increase production. This practice is also worthy of attention.

### 改装小平炉　钢产增半倍  重庆钢铁公司找到增产的好窍门

　　改装小平炉　钢产增半倍
    重庆钢铁公司找到增产的好窍门
    本报重庆4日电　重庆钢铁公司把现有平炉改大，使钢的产量增加50％以上，这是花钱少、费时短，迅速增产钢的最有效的办法。
    重庆钢铁公司改大平炉的办法是结合炉子大修在不动炉底的原则下把钢架延长、加高，斜度加大，其他各部分相应的适当加以调整、修改，使炉身熔池加深，容积加大，就可以多出钢。小平炉车间的两座炉子，原来设计能力二十吨，去年稍加改大后，每炉出钢增加到三十吨。许多工人和工程技术人员觉得炉子还大有潜力可挖，今年8月初又趁炉子大修的时候，再一次改大，每炉钢的产量平均增加到四十五吨，最多的时候达到五十一吨。炉产量比改大以前增加50％以上，比原有设计标准增加一倍多。
    为了保证以最快的办法多增产钢，这个公司目前正结合大平炉的大修，着手将两座炉子由现在每炉产九十吨改大为一百五十吨，这样就比原来五十吨的设计能力增大了两倍。这两座大平炉9月中旬改大后，从9月下旬起到年底止，即可增产四万多吨钢。
    重庆钢铁公司今年钢的生产任务要比去年实际生产数字增大一倍，公司除了新建一批转炉，最近就要投入生产外，主要是靠挖掘现有设备潜力，其中改大炉子是主要的办法。由于炉底不动，同时又是结合大修时改的，因此费时很短，一般只要花八天到十天时间，一座平炉就修改好了。就可以多出十几吨到五十几吨钢。如果新建这样两座五十吨的平炉，从设计到施工最快也需要一年才能投入生产。投资大约要一千万元。（重庆钢厂1952年新建两座平炉时投资是一千一百多万元）而目前炉子改大后，生产能力增大了五十吨，投资却只要两百万元就行了。由于炉子生产能力扩大，每吨钢的成本费用大约降低十九元。以今年这两座平炉的计划产量二十四万五千吨计算，全年即可降低成本四百六十万元。重庆钢铁公司的工程师告诉记者说，根据他们的经验，一般平炉设计时保险系数都很大，都可以改大。另外，这个公司的先进炼钢工人张文金创造的两步装料法，在快要出钢的时候再加一次铁水，产量就可以再增大。这种做法也值得重视。
