Title: Eisenhower and Münchhausen

After patiently reading the entire text of Eisenhower's televised speech, I couldn't help but exclaim: Ike, you truly are the "most honest man" in the world!

This inevitably brings to mind the image of Münchhausen in Raspe's writings (note); you are a soldier by origin, and so was he; your characters are identical. But in terms of rudeness, lying, megalomania, and excessive self-importance, you surpass him in every way.

This is not surprising. Münchhausen was merely an eighteenth-century nobleman; while you are the beloved of twentieth-century American millionaires, the president they elected with their dollars. Frankly, comparing him to you is demeaning to you. Perhaps you would solemnly declare in a loud voice—like the one you used in your televised broadcast: "Münchhausen? My abilities are ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand times greater than his!"

Indeed, that is the case.

That short, old man with a big nose, sitting by the stove, would have people shout out, whenever he told his adventure stories, "Oh, Münchhausen! You baron! Everything you say is fabricated! These things are definitely not true!" But the little old man would not even glance at them, calmly telling how he captured a wild boar alive, how he flew to the moon… The surrounding laughter grew louder, but he solemnly continued: "Whether baron, count, duke, or even sultan, I have the honor of calling them my best friends, and they have always said that I am the most honest man in the world!" Then he continued to tell how he put the cart on his shoulder, tucked two horses under his armpits, and jumped over the fence in one leap…

Of course, Ike, your personality is more "grand" and your demeanor more "elegant" than his. What he said was merely hearsay; while you, on television, facing millions of listeners, are able to use the art of lying, turning ironclad facts upside down, confusing black and white, as if there were no such thing as truth in the world, and saying it all with such seriousness. If Münchhausen's skin was only half an inch thick, yours is at least a foot thick. This is another area where you are stronger than him.

It is clearly the American army that occupies the Taiwan area and protects and instigates the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to harass our southeastern coastal areas, yet you accuse our liberation of our own territory as "threatening the security of the United States and the world"; it is clearly the United States that has repeatedly sent more warships and aircraft far from its own country to the Taiwan Strait to provoke, yet you insist that our country is "warlike" and "aggressive"; it is clearly the United States that has built military bases all over the world, and has invaded Korea, landed in Lebanon, and conspired to subvert the democratic governments of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and even Europe, yet you slander our country as a "major aggressor,"…

The protagonist of Raspe's true-story novel, due to the many absurd stories he told, has become a typical figure known as Münchhausen for nearly a century: constantly lying to portray himself as possessing all sorts of excellent qualities, even though these qualities do not exist in him.

You, Ike, also want to use this trick, with different tunes playing the same note, to accuse others of the crimes you have committed, as if your own body is clean. However, just like Münchhausen being spurned by his listeners, people know that what you are accusing and reviling is precisely what is right and good about others.

Isn't that so! Your close neighbor and ally, Canada's "Financial Times," immediately exposed your embarrassment: "For the Chinese Communists to take steps to eliminate threats to their own doors, to call that aggression is utter nonsense." It also slapped you in the face rather impolitely: "Neither heaven nor humanity has assigned the United States the task of ruling all the rest of the world."

Ike, Münchhausen was only posthumously given the title of "King of Liars"; while you, in your lifetime, have become the glorious "Lying President."

[Note] In 1785, the German writer E. Raspe compiled and processed some of the stories circulating about Münchhausen, and published "The Adventures of Münchhausen," which is a famous German satirical literary work of the eighteenth century, popular in Europe and around the world. There are also Chinese translations.

    艾克和闵豪生
    陈伯吹
    十分耐性地读完了艾森豪威尔的电视广播演说全文，禁不住拍案叫绝，艾克，你真是世界上“最诚实的人！”
    因此，就叫人想起了拉斯伯笔底下闵豪生的形象来（注）；你是军人出身，他也是个军人，你和他的性格一般无二。但你在粗野、撒谎、夸大狂、过度的自负等各方面，却比他有过之，无不及。
    这是不足为奇的。闵豪生不过是十八世纪地主出身的男爵；而你，是二十世纪美国百万富翁的大老板宠爱的人，是他们花了美元选出来的总统。说实在话，拿他来和你相提并论，未免委屈了你。也许你听到了会庄严地大声宣布说——像你在电视广播里的声音：“闵豪生？我的本领比他大十倍、百倍、千倍、万倍呢！”
    事实的确如此。
    那个长着大鼻子的矮小的老头儿，坐在火炉旁边，每当他讲自己的冒险故事时，就有人喊出来：“啊哟，闵豪生！你这男爵！你说的一切都是捏造出来的！这些事情决不是真的！”可是小老头儿瞧也不瞧他们，从从容容地讲他怎样活捉一只野猪，怎样飞到月亮上去，……周围哄笑的声音更加响了，他却郑重地接着说：“不论是男爵、伯爵、公爵，甚至苏丹，我有幸能称他们是我的最好的朋友，他们向来说我是世界上最诚实的人！”于是他继续讲他怎样把车子往肩上一放，把两匹马在腋窝下一挟，一跳就跳过了板墙，……
    当然，艾克，你的人格比他“伟大”，风度比他“高雅”。他所讲的不过是道听涂说；而你在电视里，对着几百万听众，却能够运用说谎的艺术，把铁一般的事实，说得是非颠倒，黑白混淆，仿佛世界上就没有真理这回事的，而且说得那么一本正经。如果闵豪生的脸皮只有半寸厚，你的至少在一尺以上了。这又是你比他强的地方。
    明明是美国军队侵占台湾地区，还包庇、唆使蒋贼骚扰我东南沿海各地，却反咬一口说我国解放自己领土为“威胁美国和世界的安全”；明明是美国一再增派兵舰、飞机远离本国到台湾海峡来挑衅，却硬说我国“好战”和“侵略成性”；明明是美国在世界各地大筑军事基地，而且侵略过朝鲜，登陆过黎巴嫩，阴谋颠复过亚、非、拉丁美洲，甚至欧洲各国的民主政府，却诬蔑我国是“大侵略者”，……
    拉斯伯这篇真人真事的小说的主人公，由于他说了许多最荒谬的故事，近百年来，鼎鼎大名的闵豪生，已经成为某一种人物的典型，那就是：不断地撒谎，来把自己描绘成具有种种优良品质的人，尽管这些品质在他身上是不存在的。
    你啊，艾克，要的也是这套手法，异曲而同工，把自己所犯的罪恶，含血喷人地说成是别人的。这么一来，自以为身上就干净了。然而也正像闵豪生遭到他听众的唾弃一样，人们知道你所指责的、唾骂的，恰恰是别人对的和好的方面。
    可不是！你的亲密的邻邦和盟国加拿大出版的“金融时报”，立刻 道出了你的洋相：“现在中国共产党人正在采取步骤来消除自己大门的威胁，把这叫做侵略完全是胡说八道。”它还十分不客气地赏了你一记耳光：“不论苍天或者人类都没有委派美国统治世界所有其余地方的任务。”
    艾克啊，闵豪生死后才被谥为“吹牛大王”；而你在生前就成为光荣的“撒谎总统”了。
    〔注〕1785年德国作家E·拉斯伯把一些关于流传的闵豪生所讲述的故事，整理加工后出版“闵豪生奇遇记”，为十八世纪著名德国讽刺文学作品，风行欧洲及世界各国。我国也有译本。
