In our editorial on the 20th, we said that in order to fulfill and overfulfill the production target of 10.7 million tons of steel, the daily steel output must reach 60,000 tons and the daily pig iron output must reach 100,000 tons in late September. In October, 65% of the 300,000 or so small, indigenous blast furnaces already built across the country should be put into production, and 65% of these should be able to operate normally. Furthermore, the country should have thirty to fifty counties with a daily pig iron output of 1,000 tons. Now, in addition to Henan, which has already set a record of producing 10,000 tons of pig iron per day, six provinces, including Anhui, Sichuan, Hebei, Hunan, Shanxi, and Shandong, have decided to strive to achieve a daily pig iron output of 10,000 tons before the end of September. At the same time, we have also received news that many provinces are actively preparing to create many counties with a daily pig iron output of 1,000 tons. These are all exciting news from the iron and steel front, progressing at an incredible speed. Judging from the current situation, there is great hope of achieving the above goals. To make steel production rise sharply, the key lies in conscientiously implementing the mass line in running the iron and steel industry throughout the country, and truly forming a mass movement for the whole people to run iron and steel. The great leap forward in pig iron production in Henan, Hunan, Guizhou and other provinces is the most convincing example. Take Henan Province as an example: in early September, the province only produced an average of over 780 tons of pig iron per day, while on September 15, the daily output jumped to 18,693 tons. The main experience of Henan Province in creating this miracle is that it launched a mass movement for steel production involving 3.6 million people throughout the province, thus creating a new record for high pig iron production.

Relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and vigorously launching mass movements is the foundation for the high-speed development of all our construction undertakings and the fundamental line for our party to lead all our work. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "It may not take as long as we previously thought for our country to catch up with capitalist powers in terms of industrial and agricultural production. In addition to the leadership of the Party, the population of 600 million is a decisive factor. More people mean more discussion, higher enthusiasm, and greater drive." Now, the 600 million people are full of enthusiasm, high in morale, and full of vigor. Effectively organizing the people's soaring enthusiasm and high morale can guarantee the high-speed progress of socialist construction. The great leap forward in all aspects of our country's work since the beginning of this year fully proves this point. The same is true on the industrial front: whoever mobilizes the masses most thoroughly, whose mass movement has the greatest momentum, who can fly the fastest, jump the farthest, and the most miracles will appear. Shaoyang Prefecture in Hunan Province is a region where pig iron production has developed rapidly. How did Shaoyang Prefecture organize the great leap forward in pig iron production? The most important thing is to thoroughly mobilize the masses and create a massive mass movement. They organized a mass debate throughout the region, refuting the right-leaning conservative ideas such as the "skepticism" and "condition theory" that "peasants cannot make iron," making the reasons for "why to develop iron and steel production and how to develop iron and steel production" known to every household, thereby organizing more than 10,000 cadres and 930,000 people in the region to participate in the ironmaking movement. If there was no ore, they said, "We will dig through the earth to find ore." Xiangxiang County alone mobilized more than 70,000 people to find 120 iron ore deposits and 51 coal mines. When coking coal could not be transported in time, they went to carry and move it themselves. Lianyuan County alone mobilized more than 20,000 people to form a long snake formation to transport more than 6,000 tons of coking coal down from the mountains. When the masses are mobilized to this extent, miracles will surely appear. The reason why Wu'an County in Hebei Province was able to increase its pig iron production from more than 100 tons to more than 1,000 tons in three days lies in the extensive mobilization of the masses and the organization of 120,000 people to participate in the iron and steel front. Why are Shandong and other provinces dare to propose the goal of 10,000-ton provinces? The reason also lies in the extensive mobilization of the masses, and therefore they are full of confidence.

The mass movement is also a revolutionary movement. To carry out a mass movement, we must adopt revolutionary methods and overthrow the so-called "regularization" thinking. If we don't overthrow the "regularization" thinking, the masses will not be mobilized. In the industrial sector, some people blindly believe in so-called "regularization." They believe that only "regularization" methods can be used to run industry. They have never thought that there might be another road and another way to run industry. They despise the method of launching mass movements. They say that this is rural style and guerrilla habits, which can be used to engage in agriculture and politics, but cannot be used to lead modern industry with a high level of science and technology. Of course, we need regularization, but this regularization must be revolutionary regularization, and its symbol is the ability to mobilize the power of the masses most fully, and to carry out construction the most, the fastest, the best, and the most economically! Running industry through mass movements is our regularization. Henan, Hunan, Guizhou and other provinces' large-scale operation of indigenous blast furnaces have completely broken the old set of "regularization" practices in running industry and ushered in a thorough revolution. This is: organizing large-scale debates, establishing command posts, secretaries personally going to the front line, organizing battles, the whole party and the whole people, all walks of life forming steel divisions, transportation battalions, mining teams and other field armies and logistics departments, launching day and night assaults, breaking through one point, creating high-yield records, holding on-site meetings, and promoting large-scale harvests, etc. This set of revolutionary leadership methods is a method opposed to the so-called "regularization." Without this revolutionary leadership method, without daring to challenge "regularization," there would be no mass movement and no high speed.

In the current steel production, how can we mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses? The experience of many places proves that large-scale operation of indigenous blast furnaces can best mobilize the enthusiasm of millions of people, best bring into play the wisdom and strength of the masses, and achieve the greatest results in the shortest time. At present, we have three types of blast furnaces: one is large modern blast furnaces. These furnaces have advanced equipment and high output, and are the backbone of my country's iron and steel industry.
　　We have built a number of such large blast furnaces in the past, and we will build even larger and more technologically advanced large blast furnaces in the future, so as to gradually transfer my country's steel production to an advanced technological basis. However, this type of furnace requires a large amount of investment and a large amount of equipment, and the construction time is long, which cannot solve the urgent need. One is small modern blast furnaces, or small indigenous-modern combined blast furnaces, commonly known as small blast furnaces. This type of furnace has better performance than indigenous blast furnaces and higher output than indigenous blast furnaces. Its advantages are certain and should be promoted in the future; however, this type of furnace requires some mechanical equipment, has "dependence," and requires a certain amount of time to build, and it is not easy to popularize immediately. It is also relatively difficult to rely on this type of furnace to buy time and strive for speed at present. That is to say, although the above two types of blast furnaces are technically advanced and relatively advanced, they are what we need. However, it is impossible for us to build many such modern large and small blast furnaces in a very short period of time to ensure all the pig iron needed to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year. Under the current circumstances, the only thing that can meet this need in a timely manner is the indigenous blast furnace. Now, this type of furnace is blooming everywhere. Because the indigenous blast furnace has no "dependence" at all, it is completely native, and it can be built successfully in a few days as long as you do it yourself. Therefore, it can allow the broad masses to intervene, form a mass movement for the whole people to run iron and steel, and make pig iron production develop at a high speed.

Therefore, large blast furnaces and modern blast furnaces can only be built in small numbers and by a few people, and they are built slowly. For the broad masses, they can only "sigh at the ocean" and cannot intervene, and heroes have no place to use their abilities. Indigenous blast furnaces can be built in large numbers, most people can build them, and they are built quickly. For the broad masses, they can all intervene, and heroes have a place to use their abilities. From this point of view, there are two ways to increase pig iron production: one is "small, indigenous, and mass," which is to build small indigenous blast furnaces on a large scale, relying on the broad masses to do it, so that the output of pig iron can be increased rapidly; the other is "large, modern, and specialized," which is to only build large modern blast furnaces, relying only on specialized technical personnel to do it. The result of doing so is that the output of pig iron cannot be rapidly increased in a relatively short period of time. Therefore, the former approach is a practical and effective method under the current circumstances in our country. About 50% of all pig iron produced from September 1st to 20th was produced by indigenous blast furnaces, and this proportion may increase. It can be seen how important the indigenous blast furnace is in the current steel production. One of the important reasons why the pig iron production in many places rose relatively quickly in September is that they grasped the indigenous blast furnace. The broad masses, whether they are old ladies in their 50s or 60s, or children in their teens, can all contribute a share of their strength, so there has emerged a real mass movement in which men, women, old and young all work together, and a prosperous scene in which tens of thousands of indigenous blast furnaces are flowing with molten iron. It is truly "like a spring breeze overnight, thousands of trees and tens of thousands of pear trees bloom."

Some people think that calling indigenous blast furnaces to produce iron is not as reliable as calling modern blast furnaces to produce iron. After several times of slagging but not producing iron, they waver about the indigenous blast furnaces. Yes, indigenous blast furnaces do not have the strict scientific design and modern technical equipment as modern blast furnaces. Some problems that are not problems in modern blast furnaces are still serious problems in indigenous blast furnaces. In this respect, indigenous blast furnaces are more difficult to handle than modern blast furnaces. However, this is only one aspect of the problem. Another aspect of the problem is that the entire construction process of indigenous blast furnaces is done by the masses themselves, and the wisdom of the masses can create various experiences to make indigenous blast furnaces produce a large amount of iron and normal iron. The examples of counties with thousands of tons that have now appeared all show that as long as we rely closely on the masses, are good at summing up the experience of the masses in a timely manner, and quickly promote the experience of advanced people, the technical barriers of indigenous blast furnaces can be completely broken through.

Some people think that indigenous blast furnaces consume too much labor, the production cost is too high, and it is not economical and cost-effective. Yes, it is necessary to mobilize many people to engage in indigenous blast furnaces, and the production cost is relatively high. However, the problem lies in speed, in buying time, that is to say, we must ensure that we get 10.7 million tons of steel this year, not one ton less. And indigenous blast furnaces are the only furnaces that can produce a large amount of iron in the shortest time because they are simple to build and can be launched and done on a large scale by the masses, and there is no other way to do so. Moreover, the production cost of indigenous blast furnaces is not impossible to reduce. Now, the production cost of some indigenous blast furnaces is 300 yuan per ton of iron, while some only cost 70 yuan, which shows that there is great potential. As long as we do our job well, it is not difficult to reduce the production cost. What's more, if you really want to calculate accounts, the first thing you should calculate is the account of people. After the blooming of indigenous blast furnaces everywhere, the broad masses have learned the skills of ironmaking. On this basis, further improvements will train a strong iron and steel army for our country, which cannot be bought with any amount of money. If you want to calculate the money account, you should first calculate the construction cost account. Modern blast furnaces cannot start without investing 100,000 or 1 million yuan of capital. Indigenous blast furnaces are "capital-free business" and can be started from scratch completely. Weighing the pros and cons, where to go, isn't it very clear?

The pig iron production from September 10th to 20th has increased significantly compared with the previous ten days, and the situation is gradually improving. It is expected that many places will create higher records in late September. September will soon pass and October will arrive, which is a decisive battle month. We must mobilize millions of people more widely and deeply to participate in the iron and steel front, give full play to the wisdom and strength of the masses, so that most of the indigenous blast furnaces can have molten iron flowing constantly and the output can increase sharply, ensuring that we get 10.7 million tons of steel this year. This is the most urgent task in steel production.

### 关键在于大搞群众运动

    关键在于大搞群众运动
    我们曾经在20日的社论里说过，为了完成和超额完成一千零七十万吨钢的生产任务，9月下旬的钢的日产量必须达到六万吨，生铁日产量必须达到十万吨；10月份，在全国已建成的三十几万座土小高炉中，应该有65％投入生产，其中又有65％能够正常生产，全国还应该有三十个到五十个日产千吨铁的县。现在，除了河南已创造了日产生铁万吨的纪录以外，又有安徽、四川、河北、湖南、山西、山东等六个省已经决定力争在9月底以前达到日产生铁万吨的目标。同时，我们还得到消息说，许多省都在积极准备创造许多个日产生铁千吨的县。这些都是钢铁战线上一日千里的喜讯。从目前的情况看来，完成上述的目标大有希望。要使钢铁产量猛烈上涨，关键在于在全国范围内认真贯彻办钢铁工业的群众路线，真正形成一个全民办钢铁的群众运动。河南、湖南、贵州等省生铁生产的大跃进，就是最有说服力的例子。拿河南省来说吧：这个省在9月上旬，每天平均只产生铁七百八十多吨，而9月15日的日产量就跳到一万八千六百九十三吨。河南省创造这个奇迹的主要经验，就是在全省范围内开展了一个有三百六十万人参加的钢铁生产的群众运动，因而能够创造出生铁高产的新纪录。
    依靠群众，发动群众，大搞特搞群众运动，是我们一切建设事业高速度发展的基础，是我们党领导各项工作的根本路线。毛泽东同志说：“我国在工农业生产方面赶上资本主义大国，可能不需要从前所想的那样长的时间了。除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。人多议论多，热气高，干劲大。”现在，六亿人民干劲冲天，斗志昂扬，意气风发。切实有效地把人民群众的冲天干劲和昂扬的斗志组织起来，就能够保证社会主义建设高速度地前进。今年以来我国各方面工作的大跃进，完全证明了这一点。在工业战线上也是这样，谁发动群众最彻底，群众运动的声势最大，谁就能飞得最快，跳得最远，奇迹也就出现最多。湖南省的邵阳专区，是一个生铁生产发展很快的地区。邵阳专区是怎样组织生铁生产大跃进的呢？最主要的，也就是彻底发动群众，造成声势浩大的群众运动。他们组织了全民大辩论，驳倒了“农民炼不出铁来”的“怀疑论”、“条件论”等右倾保守思想，使“为什么要发展钢铁生产、如何发展钢铁生产”的道理家喻户晓，从而在全区组织了万余干部、九十三万群众投入炼铁运动。没有矿，他们说：“把地球挖穿，也要挖出矿来”，仅一个湘乡县，就发动了七万多人找到一百二十处铁矿和五十一处煤矿。焦煤运不及，他们自己去挑，去搬，仅一个涟源县就发动二万多人排成长蛇阵，从山上运下六千多吨焦煤，当群众发动到这样的程度，奇迹就一定会出现。河北省武安县所以能在三天之内使生铁产量从一百多吨提高到一千多吨，其原因也在于广泛发动了群众，组织了十二万人投入钢铁战线。山东等省为什么敢于提出万吨省的目标？其原因也在于广泛发动了群众，因而满怀信心。
    群众运动也就是革命运动。搞群众运动必须采取革命的方法，必须打倒所谓“正规化”的思想。不打倒“正规化”的思想，群众就发动不起来。在工业部门中，有一些人一味迷信所谓“正规化”。他们认为，只有用“正规化”的方法才能办工业。他们从没有想过，办工业居然还会有另外一条道路，另外一种办法。他们藐视搞群众运动的方法。他们说这是农村作风、游击习气，用来搞农业、搞政治还可以，用来领导具有高度科学技术水平的现代工业就吃不开了。当然，我们是需要正规化的，但这种正规化必须是革命的正规化，它的标志就是能够最充分地动员群众的力量，能够最多最快最好最省地进行建设！通过群众运动来办工业，这就是我们的正规化。河南、湖南、贵州等省大办土高炉，都完全打破了过去办工业的一套“正规化”的做法，来了一个彻底的革命。这就是：组织大辩论，成立指挥部，书记亲自上前线，组织战役，全党全民、各行各业编成钢铁师、运输营，采矿队等各种野战军、后勤部，昼夜突击，突破一点，创造高产纪录，开现场会议，推动大面积丰收等等。这一套革命的领导方法是同所谓“正规化”对立的方法，没有这种革命的领导方法，不敢向“正规化”挑战，就没有群众运动，就没有高速度。
    在当前的钢铁生产中，怎样才能把广大群众的积极性通通调动起来呢？许多地方的经验证明：大办土高炉最能把千百万群众的积极性动员起来，最能发挥群众的智慧和力量，最能在最短的时间内，取得最大的效果。目前我们有三种高炉：一种是大的洋高炉。这种炉子设备先进，产量很高，是我国钢铁工业的骨干。　
  　我们过去已经建设了一批这样的大高炉，今后还要建设更大的技术上更先进的大高炉，以便把我国的钢铁生产逐步转移到先进的技术基础上。但这种炉子需要大量的投资和大量的设备，而且建设时间较长，不能解决燃眉之急。一种是小的洋高炉，或者小的土洋结合的高炉，通称小高炉。这种炉子性能比土高炉好，产量比土高炉高，它的好处是肯定的，今后要加以提倡；但这种炉子需要一些机械设备，有“依赖性”，需要一定的时间去建设，马上也不容易普及。靠这种炉子来争取时间，争取速度，目前也是比较困难的。这就是说，以上这两种高炉虽然从技术上说是先进的和比较先进的，是我们所需要的。但我们不可能在很短的时间内建设起许多这样的近代化的大高炉和小高炉，以保证在今年生产一千零七十万吨钢所需要的全部生铁。在目前情况下，唯一能够及时满足这种需要的是土高炉。现在遍地开花的也就是这种炉子。因为土高炉没有任何“依赖性”，完全是土生土长的，只要自己动手几天内就可以建造成功，因而能够使广大的群众插进手来，形成一个全民办钢铁的运动，使生铁生产高速度地发展。
    因此，大高炉、洋高炉只能少办、少数人办，而且办得慢，对于广大群众来说，只能“望洋兴叹”，插不上手，英雄无用武之地。土高炉则能多办，绝大多数人可以办，而且办得快，对于广大群众来说，都可以插上手，英雄有用武之地。由此看来，要增加生铁生产，可以有两种做法：一种是“小、土、群”，这就是大办小的土高炉，依靠广大群众来办，这样就可以迅速增加生铁的产量；另一种做法是“大、洋、专”，这就是只搞大的洋高炉，只依靠专门技术人员来办，这样做的结果，就不能在比较短的时间内迅速地大量地增加生铁的产量。因此，前一种做法，是在我国目前情况下切实有效的办法。9月1日到20日生产出的全部生铁中有50％左右都是土高炉生产的，这个比重还可能提高。可见土高炉在当前的钢铁生产中，处于何等重要的地位。许多地方9月份的生铁生产上升得比较快，重要原因之一就是抓紧了土高炉。广大的群众，不管是五、六十岁的老太太，不管是十几岁的小孩子，都能出一份力量，因而出现了男女老少一齐动手的真正的群众运动，出现了几万座土高炉铁水齐流的兴旺局面。真是“忽如一夜春风来，千树万树梨花开”。
    有人以为叫土高炉出铁不像叫洋高炉出铁那样有把握，几次出渣不出铁，就对土高炉发生动摇。是的，土高炉不像洋高炉那样有严格的科学设计，有现代化的技术装备。一些在洋高炉不成其为问题的问题，在土高炉还是严重的问题。从这方面说，土高炉比洋高炉难搞。然而，这只是问题的一个方面。问题的另一个方面是，土高炉的全部建造过程都是群众自己动手的，群众的智慧可以创造各种各样的经验，叫土高炉大量出铁、正常出铁。现在已经出现的千吨县的事例都说明了：只要紧紧地依靠群众，善于及时总结群众的经验，和迅速推广先进者的经验，土高炉的技术关是完全可以突破的。
    有人认为土高炉耗费的劳动力太多，生产成本太高，不经济，不合算，是的，搞土高炉必须要动员很多人，生产成本是比较高。但是，问题在于速度，在于争取时间，就是说必须保证今年拿到一千零七十万吨钢，少一吨也不行。而土高炉由于建造简单，能够发动群众普遍地搞、大量地搞，因而是唯一能够在最短的时间内大量出铁的炉子，舍此别无他途。况且，土高炉的生产成本也不是不能降低的。现在有的土高炉每吨铁的生产成本三百元，有的只七十元，可见潜力很大，只要我们工作做得好，就不难降低生产成本。更何况，真要算账的话，首先应该算的是人的账。经过土高炉遍地开花，广大群众都学到了炼铁的本领，在这个基础上加以提高，将为我国训练出一支强大的钢铁大军，这是多少钱也买不到的。如果要算钱的账，也首先要算建设成本的账。洋高炉不投入十万、百万本钱不能动工，土高炉是“无本生意”，完全可以白手起家。权衡利弊，何去何从，不是十分清楚的吗？
    9月10日到20日的生铁生产，比前一旬有较大的增长，情况是逐步好转的，预计9月下旬许多地方将创造更高的纪录。9月很快就要过去，10月就要到来，这是一个决定性战斗的月份。我们必须更广泛地更深入地动员千百万群众参加到钢铁战线上来，充分发挥群众的智慧和力量，使绝大部分的土高炉都能铁水常流，产量猛增，保证今年拿到一千零七十万吨钢，这是钢铁生产中的当务之急。
