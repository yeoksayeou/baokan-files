Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Just as the Sino-US ambassadorial talks are resuming in Warsaw, responsible officials at the White House and the Pentagon, ignoring the world's opinion that hopes to resolve the international dispute in the Taiwan Strait through negotiations, are continuing to intensify their military threats and atomic blackmail against China.

    A large number of news dispatches from Taipei by Western news agencies in the past two days indicate that the United States is frantically and continuously strengthening its armed forces in the Taiwan area, and US reinforcement troops of various services are successively gathering in Taiwan.

    The news said that the US military assistance advisory group stationed in Taiwan, which is responsible for training, supplying, and commanding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, has now expanded to four thousand five hundred people.

    The US Department of Defense announced on the 15th that it would transfer the Second Missile Battalion of the Seventy-Second Artillery Regiment from the US Fort Bliss base in Texas to the Pacific region. The Associated Press said that this "Nike" missile battalion is going to Taiwan. The entire battalion has more than seven hundred people and a total of forty-eight "Nike" missile launchers.

    US imperialists are turning China's territory of Taiwan into a missile base to threaten mainland China and peace in the Far East. It is worth noting a report by a United Press International reporter on the 15th after visiting a US military base in Taiwan. This report said that in the past six weeks, the US "Matador" missiles have been in a state of readiness for launch day and night, all pointing towards mainland China. This shows that the United States had already deliberately expanded its provocations against our country as early as the beginning of August, and that the US's reckless behavior of intensifying the tension in the Taiwan Strait region, which began in late August, was premeditated. The United States has also recently dispatched a mixed air force unit to Taiwan, claiming that this is an offensive "attack force" with its spearhead pointed at mainland China. US military personnel have repeatedly boasted that all of the unit's attack aircraft can carry and drop nuclear weapons. This is a blatant and arrogant act of atomic blackmail by the US aggressors against the Chinese people.

    US generals are also busy plotting war conspiracies in Taiwan. Porter, commander of the US Pacific Air Force Logistics Command, arrived in Taipei on the 15th to discuss with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique the issue of accelerating US supply of air force equipment to the Chiang bandits. US Taiwan Defense Command Commander Smoot and US Taiwan Strait Patrol Fleet Commander Blackburn are also busy with deployments to invade our country. The United States has also recently increased a large number of ground troops stationed in Taiwan, occupying more farmland and real estate of the Taiwanese people as US military barracks.

    The Chinese people are closely watching the US aggressors' expanded military deployments in the Taiwan area, and are vigilant against the extremely dangerous fire-playing policies of the US war maniacs.

### 在中美会谈恢复的同时  美国仍加紧扩大侵略部署

    在中美会谈恢复的同时
    美国仍加紧扩大侵略部署
    新华社16日讯　正当中美大使级会谈在华沙恢复举行的时候，美国白宫和五角大楼的负责官员们，却悍然不顾全世界舆论希望用谈判方法来解决台湾海峡地区的国际争端，继续加紧对中国进行军事威胁和原子讹诈的部署。
    这两天西方国家通讯社由台北发出的大量消息表明，美国正在疯狂地不断加强台湾地区的武装力量，各个兵种的美国增援部队陆续在台湾集结。
    消息说，负责训练、供养和指挥蒋贼军作战的美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团，现在已经扩大到四千五百人。
    美国国防部在15日宣布，将从美国得克萨斯州的勃立斯堡基地抽调第七十二炮兵团的第二导弹营去太平洋地区。美联社说，这个“奈克”式导弹营就是前去台湾。全营有七百多人，共有四十八个“奈克”式导弹发射器。
    美帝国主义者正在把中国领土台湾变为他威胁中国大陆和远东和平的导弹基地。值得注意的是，合众国际社记者在15日访问台湾美军基地后的一篇报道。这篇报道说，在过去六个星期中，美国的“斗牛士”式导弹白天黑夜都处在随时准备发射的状态，方向都向着中国大陆。这说明了美国早在六个星期以前，即是8月初间就已经蓄意扩大向我国寻衅了，美国在8月下旬开始的加剧台湾海峡地区紧张局势的玩火行为是早有预谋的。美国最近还派遣了一支空军混合部队到台湾，扬言这是进攻性的“攻击力量”，锋芒指向中国大陆，美国的军方人士一再吹嘘这个部队的全部攻击机都能够携带和投掷核武器。这是美国侵略者彰明昭著的向中国人民进行原子讹诈的狂妄行为。
    美国的将军们也在台湾忙着策划战争阴谋。美国太平洋地区空军后勤部队司令波特尔在15日到了台北，同蒋介石卖国集团讨论加速美国对蒋贼供应空军装备的问题。侵台美军司令斯摩特和美国台湾海峡巡逻舰队司令布莱克本等，也都忙着侵略我国的部署。美国最近还增派了大批地面部队驻在台湾，霸占了台湾人民更多的农田和房地作为美军兵营区。
    中国人民正在密切注视着美国侵略者在台湾地区扩大侵略的军事部署，警惕美国战争狂人的极端危险的玩火政策。
