Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 16th: The Sino-US talks have become the focus of attention for Warsaw newspapers. Today, all newspapers published detailed news of the talks that began yesterday in Warsaw on the front page, accompanied by pictures.

    "People's Tribune" published an editorial on the Sino-US talks. The newspaper wrote that the Warsaw talks have become the focus of world opinion today. The US ruling clique's stubborn adherence to its old anti-China policy and continued armed intervention in the Taiwan Strait is a serious threat to peace. Most international opinion, including a large part of public opinion in Western countries and the United States itself, recognizes that the US view on the issue of the Chinese coastal islands is bound to place the United States in a position of political isolation in the world. "People's Tribune" pointed out that Eisenhower said that force should not be used in resolving the Taiwan conflict. However, the United States itself has been using force in the past and is still using it now. Without the US Navy and Air Force, the Chiang Kai-shek clique would not be able to hold out for even twenty-four hours.

    The newspaper pointed out that the continued occupation of Taiwan and the Chinese coastal islands by US armed forces has turned these islands into bases for constant provocations against the People's Republic of China. The newspaper said that in his speech, Eisenhower reiterated the old tune of trying to continue occupying Taiwan and the coastal islands of the People's Republic of China, and tried to speak to the People's Republic of China in a commanding tone. However, it should be warned that Eisenhower must understand that this statement cannot improve the US position in the conflict. Ambassadorial-level negotiations began under these circumstances. Negotiations are difficult, but there is no doubt that, as Mao Zedong said, if both sides have the sincerity to solve the problem, the negotiations may achieve some results. The Polish people have the same wish.

    The newspaper concluded by saying that Poland has fraternal and friendly relations with the People's Republic of China and understands the ardent desire of the People's China for peaceful coexistence. Poland hopes that Eisenhower's words about longing for peace can be fulfilled, that US warships and planes will withdraw from Chinese territorial waters, and that the People's Republic of China's sovereignty over all Chinese territory will be recognized.

    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 15th: Cairo Radio today issued a commentary pointing out that as the Sino-US talks began to resume in Warsaw, the United States announced that it would step up the establishment of missile weapon bases in Taiwan. This shows that the United States is pretending to be peaceful in front of the world, while hiding a dagger behind its back, ready to ignite the flames of the Third World War. The commentary pointed out that this is not because anyone is invading the United States, but simply because China wants to recover its territory that has been forcibly occupied by the United States.

    The radio station concluded by saying that imperialism is always doomed to failure.

    Cairo's "Evening News" today published a commentary on the Sino-US Warsaw talks, saying that it is difficult to predict whether the talks will succeed or fail. The newspaper pointed out, when commenting on the US situation, that if the United States attacks the Chinese mainland, it will encounter strong opposition from the whole world; reaching a peaceful agreement with China is the only possible way for the United States to get out of its predicament. The commentary said that we do not know whether Dulles will accept the logic of facts: the United States either negotiates and reaches a peaceful agreement with China, or once again leads the world to the brink of war. The United States has no other choice.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 16th: Jakarta's "People's Daily" today published a commentary calling for the wide mobilization of public opinion to promote the Sino-US talks to reach an agreement on easing the tension in the Taiwan Strait, so that the United States will withdraw its troops from China's islands, so as to avoid the outbreak of war.

    The newspaper expressed its agreement with Chairman Mao Zedong's opinion expressed at the Supreme State Conference: if both sides have the sincerity to solve the problem, the negotiations may achieve some results.

    The newspaper condemned the United States for putting forward absurd conditions when expressing its agreement to resume Sino-US talks. It said that the reason why the Sino-US talks have been held for two years without achieving any results is that the United States has never shown the sincerity to solve the problem.

    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 16th: "The Mirror" published an editorial on the ambassadorial-level talks between China and the United States in Warsaw, saying that the people of the world hope that the Sino-US talks will be successful. The newspaper also said that whether the talks are successful or not depends on the United States, because "if the United States did not cultivate Chiang Kai-shek as a running dog and did not obstruct China from entering the United Nations, the whole problem would not have arisen at all."

### 各国舆论注视中美会谈  谴责美国继续向我国挑衅

    各国舆论注视中美会谈
    谴责美国继续向我国挑衅
    据新华社华沙16日电　中美会谈成了华沙报纸的注意中心。今天所有报纸都在第一版头条地位刊登了昨天在华沙开始的谈判的详细消息并附有图片。
    “人民论坛报”就中美会谈问题发表了社论。报纸写道，华沙谈判今天成了世界舆论的注意中心。美国统治集团顽固地坚持它的老一套的对华政策并继续对台湾海峡进行武装干涉，这种做法是对和平的严重威胁。大多数国际舆论，其中包括西方国家和美国本国的大部分舆论都承认，美国对待中国沿海岛屿问题的观点必然会使美国在世界上处于政治孤立的地位。“人民论坛报”指出：艾森豪威尔说，在解决台湾冲突时不应当使用武力。但是，美国自己过去和现在都一直在使用武力。没有美国的海军和空军，蒋介石集团连二十四小时都支持不下去。
    报纸指出，美国武装力量对台湾和中国沿海岛屿的继续占据，使这些岛屿变成了对中华人民共和国进行不断挑衅的基地。报纸说，艾森豪威尔在演说中重弹了企图继续占据中华人民共和国的台湾和沿海岛屿的老调，企图用一种发号施令的语言同中华人民共和国讲话。但是，应当警告，艾森豪威尔必须明白，他的这种说法不能改善美国在冲突中的地位。大使级谈判就是在这种情况下开始的。谈判是困难的，但是毫无疑问，正如毛泽东所说，如果双方具有解决问题的诚意，谈判可能取得某些成果。波兰人民也有着同样的愿望。
    报纸最后说，波兰同中华人民共和国有着兄弟般的友好联系，并且了解人民中国对和平共处的热烈愿望。波兰希望，艾森豪威尔关于渴望和平的话能够兑现，美国军舰和飞机将撤离中国领海，并承认中华人民共和国对全部中国领土的主权。
    据新华社开罗15日电　开罗电台今天发表评论指出，当中美两国会谈在华沙开始恢复的时候，美国宣布要加紧在台湾建立火箭武器基地，这表明美国一方面在全世界面前装作要和平，另一方面却在它的背后藏着匕首，准备燃起第三次世界大战的战火。评论指出，这不是由于有谁对美国进行侵略，只不过是由于中国要收复它的被美国强占的领土。
    这家电台最后说，帝国主义总是要失败的。
    开罗“晚报”今天就中美华沙会谈发表评论说，很难预料这次会谈会成功还是失败。这家报纸在评论美国的处境时指出，美国如果进攻中国大陆，就会遭到全世界的强烈反对；同中国达成和平协议，是美国摆脱困境的唯一可能的出路。评论说，我们不知道杜勒斯是否会接受事实的逻辑：美国或者同中国谈判和达成和平协议，或者再次把世界领向战争边缘，此外美国没有别的选择。
    据新华社雅加达16日电　雅加达“人民日报”今天发表评论，要求广泛动员舆论，来促使中美会谈就缓和台湾海峡地区的紧张局势问题达成协议，从而使美国从中国的岛屿撤退它的军队，以便有可能避免爆发战争。
    这家报纸表示同意毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上所表示的意见：如果双方具有解决问题的诚意的话，谈判可能会取得某些成果。
    报纸谴责美国在表示同意恢复中美会谈时提出荒谬的条件，它说，中美会谈举行了两年之久还未能取得结果的原因就是美国始终没有表现出解决问题的诚意。
    据新华社仰光16日电　“镜报”就中美两国在华沙举行的大使级会谈发表社论说，世界人民希望中美会谈获得成功。这家报纸又说，会谈是否成功，责任在于美国，因为“如果美国不把蒋介石培养成走狗，不阻挠中国进入联合国的话，整个问题根本就不会发生。”
