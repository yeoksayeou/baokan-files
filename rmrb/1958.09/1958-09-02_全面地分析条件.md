　　Analyzing Conditions Comprehensively
　　Ding Jing
    Just as the Party Central Committee called for striving for 10.7 million tons of steel, the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel's first and second steelmaking plants took the lead. On August 29th, they increased production by more than 2,600 tons of steel compared to the average daily production plan. These steels, when rolled into steel products, can be used to manufacture twenty sets of rolling mills with an annual output of 50,000 tons of steel, or to manufacture more than 800 heavy-duty trucks.
    An increase of more than 2,600 tons per day, how much would that be in a year? If the production record is further improved, what would that be? Here, we do not intend to spend a lot of space calculating these specific figures. What is worth calculating is how this increase in production was achieved.
    Were there changes in their production equipment conditions? No. The production conditions and equipment conditions of these two factories were no different from the past. Was there an increase in manpower? No, there wasn't. The labor force was no different from the past either. Since the equipment conditions and manpower conditions have not changed, why has the production record changed? The only reason is that the workers' enthusiasm and dedication are higher than in the past, the workers' spirit of cooperation is more developed than in the past, and the workers' determination to seize steel from time is stronger than in the past. This is the result of changes in mental outlook affecting changes in production. If we want to talk about conditions, we should say that this is a condition of decisive significance.
    However, there is a small group of people who do not see this condition. When the leaping progress task is placed before them, they sit in the office, pinching their fingers, calculating that to complete the plan and increase production to so and so much, they must increase so much equipment, so much material, and so much manpower. When they see that these conditions cannot be realized, they sigh and complain that the superiors do not provide assistance in materials and equipment. And they say: "Eight months of the year have already passed, how can we make another leap forward without the conditions?" This is a noteworthy "theory of conditions." Although the number of people who sing this tune is extremely small.
    We never deny that doing a good job requires certain conditions; however, we are different from condition-only theorists. Condition-only theorists often exaggerate objective difficulties, emphasize objective conditions, and put subjective conditions aside, not calculating them in, so they see thorns everywhere, difficulties are numerous, and they only want to wait for the superiors to give favorable conditions, without considering how to create conditions and improve conditions themselves. They only see the role of things, but not the role of people, only see dead factors, but not living factors. Thus, condition-only theorists often degenerate into helpless pessimists.
    Dialectical materialists have always advocated "proceeding from time, place, and conditions," and the conditions mentioned here include both subjective and objective conditions. Objective difficult factors are a condition, objective favorable factors are also a condition, subjective weaknesses are a condition, and subjective dynamic action is also a condition. Only by comprehensively and thoughtfully analyzing these conditions and factors, analyzing the internal connections and laws of things, grasping favorable conditions, and changing difficult conditions, can we move forward step by step and create miracles.

　　全面地分析条件
　　丁井
    正当党中央号召为一千零七十万吨钢而奋斗的时候，鞍钢第一和第二炼钢厂的职工一马当先，8月29日一天，比平均日产计划就增产了二千六百多吨钢。这些钢轧成钢材可以用来制造年产五万吨钢材的轧钢机二十套，或者用来制造载重汽车八百多辆。
    一天增产二千六百多吨，一年该是多少呢？如果把生产纪录再提高一下，又该是多少呢？这里，我们不打算花很大的篇幅去计算这些具体数字，值得计算的是这样的增产是怎样作出来的。
    是他们的生产设备条件有了改变吗？不。这两个厂的生产条件和设备条件同过去并没有两样。是人力有了增加吗？也不。劳动力同过去也没有两样。既然设备条件和人力条件都没有改变，为什么生产纪录却有了改变呢？唯一的原因，工人们的干劲和钻劲比过去高昂了，工人们的协作精神比过去更加发扬了，工人们向时间要钢的决心比过去更坚强了。这就是精神面貌的变化影响到生产变化的结果。如果要谈条件的话，应该说，这是一个有决定意义的条件。
    然而，有这么一小部分人却看不到这个条件，当跃进任务放到他面前的时候，他就坐在办公室里，捏着指头，计算要完成计划把产量提高到多少多少，就必须增加多少设备，多少材料，多少人力。当他们看到这些条件不能实现的时候，就唉声叹气，埋怨上级在材料设备上不给以帮助。并且说：“一年已经过去八个月了，没有条件怎能再跃进呢？”这是一种值得注意的“条件论”。尽管唱这种论调的人是极少的。
    我们从来不否认办好一件事情要有一定的条件；但是，我们同唯条件论者不同，条件论者常常夸大客观困难，强调客观条件，而把主观条件放在一边，不计算进去，因而他们满眼荆棘，困难重重，只想等待上级给予优厚的条件，而不考虑自己怎样去创造条件，改善条件。他们只看见物的作用，看不见人的作用，只看见死的因素，看不见活的因素。于是条件论者常常沦为束手无策的悲观主义者了。
    辩证唯物主义者一向主张“一切从时间、地点、条件出发”，这里所说的条件是包括主客观条件在内的条件。客观的困难因素是一个条件，客观的有利因素又是一个条件，主观的弱点是个条件，主观的能动作用又是一个条件，只有全面地周到地分析这些条件和因素，分析事物的内在联系和规律，掌握有利条件，改变困难条件，才能步步前进，创造奇迹。
