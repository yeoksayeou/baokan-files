　　The First Quarrel

　　In the Wanyu Cooperative in Lanxi County, Heilongjiang, there were two young members, a man named Wang Wenfang and a woman named Zhou Guiyun, both members of the Communist Youth League. They were so close, like one person, and never argued or fought. It looked like they were about to get married. But, unexpectedly, they had their first quarrel on the eve of their wedding.

　　One day, Wang Wenfang was assigned to plow a cornfield. Seeing that there were no big weeds in the field and it didn't need weeding, he hitched up the plow and started plowing. Unfortunately, after plowing only seven rows, Zhou Guiyun happened to pass by. When she saw it, she shouted:

　　"Hey, why are you plowing without weeding first?" Wenfang saw it was Guiyun and said with a smile, "This is more efficient than weeding, mind your own business!" With that, he urged the horse to continue plowing. Guiyun saw that he didn't take it seriously and immediately ran in front of the animal, blocking its path.

　　"Guiyun, stop fooling around! Let's talk as we walk!" Guiyun saw that Wenfang still didn't care, so she put on a stern face: "Who's joking with you! If you don't pay attention to quality, how are we going to increase production?" Wenfang saw that Guiyun was serious and felt a little embarrassed. He wanted to admit his mistake right away, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. He just flicked the whip, and the horse sped forward along the row again.

　　Guiyun was so angry that she pouted and ran angrily towards the cooperative.

　　Before long, Guiyun came back with the branch secretary. At this time, Wenfang was secretly blaming himself. Before Guiyun could speak, he blushed, glanced at Guiyun, and said, "I was wrong, don't be angry with me!" Guiyun heard this and burst out laughing.

　　第一次纠纷
    黑龙江兰西县万余社，有两个青年社员，男的叫王文芳，女的叫周桂云，都是共青团员。他俩好的活像一个人似地，从没有吵过嘴，打过架，眼看就要结婚了。但是，谁也没想到，就在结婚的前夕，他们却发生了第一次纠纷。
    一天，王文芳被分配去铲趟苞米地。他看到地里没有大草，用不着铲，就驾上犁杖趟起来。不巧，刚趟了七垅，周桂云有事路过这里。她看到后，劈头就喊：
    “哎，怎么没铲就趟呢？”文芳一看，是桂云，便笑嘻嘻地说：“这比铲得劲，别多管闲事！”说完，就赶着马继续趟起来。桂云看他没当回事，立即跑到牲口前，挡住了路。
    “桂云，别闹了！有话，咱们就一边走，一边说！”桂云看文芳还不在乎，就板起了脸：“谁跟你开玩笑！这样不注意质量，还想不想增产啦？”文芳一看桂云来真的，就有点不好意思起来。本想马上认错，一时也拉不下面子。只见他把鞭子一甩，那马又顺垅飞驰前进。
    桂云气得噘着嘴，气昂昂地向社里跑去。
    不一会，桂云和支部书记一起来了。这时，文芳正在暗暗地责备自己。他没等桂云开口，就红着脸，朝桂云望了一眼，说：“是我不对，别生我的气！”桂云一听，噗哧地笑了。
