Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 12th: The U.S. government's military provocation policy towards China in the Taiwan area continues to be the target of criticism in many American newspapers. These newspapers, from various perspectives and citing the views of various individuals, express their opposition to this policy.

    The "San Francisco Chronicle" on the 10th called on the U.S. government to change its policy. The newspaper believes that if the Quemoy-Matsu crisis is to be permanently resolved, the United States must abandon the attitude that has hitherto dominated its position on these islands. The newspaper said, "It would be very foolish for us to fight a battle to keep these islands."
    The "New York Post" also published an article by Simms on the 5th, stating that the United States is now maintaining the "corrupt, expelled" Chiang Kai-shek group, which future historians will find strange. He asked, "How many billions of dollars have we invested in this unjust cause? How many American lives are we prepared to sacrifice for this and other crazy plans? How long can our push-button diplomacy be supported and prolonged?"
    The "Christian Science Monitor" published an article by its Washington correspondent Sterlinger on the 6th, stating that the U.S. attitude on the Quemoy issue is "unrealistic." He pointed out that even some influential figures in the U.S. government believe that this stubborn preservation of islands in a foreign port cannot win the world's sympathy for the United States.
    The "New York Times" published an article by James Reston on the 8th, pointing out that the U.S. government's recent policies in the Taiwan Strait area "have caused anxiety among young people of draft age," who distrust the government's policies. Reston said, "A smart American youth facing conscription made a remark here this week that better explains the mood of people in the capital than anything else. He said that he could never hope to get enough information so that he could correctly judge whether it was wise to fight Communist China for the coastal islands of Quemoy and Matsu, but he felt he had no right to believe that the government was treating the problems it faced in China in a systematic and serious manner."
    Reston also pointed out that the current U.S. policy of provoking the People's Republic of China has caused anxiety even among some people in the U.S. State Department.
    The "Nation" weekly said in an editorial on the 6th, "The U.S. policy toward Red China amounts to continuing past mistakes indefinitely." The editorial said that geography is not completely outdated, and the relationship between China's coastal islands and the Chinese ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou is roughly equivalent to the relationship between Martha's Vineyard and New Bedford. The editorial said that neutral Asian countries also tend to believe that under this premise, it is not unnatural or unreasonable for China to liberate these islands. The editorial warned the United States not to engage in a crazy adventure against China.
    The "Wall Street Journal" said on the 8th that many Democratic congressmen also believe that China's coastal islands are not so important as to warrant U.S. military intervention. The newspaper said that Washington's practice of helping the Chiang Kai-shek group "defend" these islands "has far less public support than the dispatch of U.S. Marines to Lebanon in mid-July."
    Margaret Higgins of the "New York Herald Tribune" said on the 8th that the United States must face the fact that as time passes, the opportunity for "Chiang Kai-shek to return to the mainland" will virtually cease to exist, and therefore, in the eyes of most of the world, his army's continued presence on islands very close to the Chinese mainland "will at least prove increasingly embarrassing."

### 美国舆论责骂政府进行愚蠢的冒险  要求改变顽固政策不要继续以往错误

    美国舆论责骂政府进行愚蠢的冒险
    要求改变顽固政策不要继续以往错误
    据新华社12日讯　纽约消息：美国政府在台湾地区对中国采取的军事挑衅政策继续成为许多美国报刊的抨击对象。这些报刊从各种不同角度并且引证各个方面的人士的看法来表示反对这种政策。
    “旧金山纪事报”10日要求美国政府改变政策。这家报纸认为，如果金门—马祖危机要得到永久解决的话，美国将必须放弃迄今为止一直支配着它对这些岛屿的立场的态度。这家报纸说，“我们如果进行一场战斗来保持这些岛屿，那是非常愚蠢的。”
    “纽约邮报”5日还登载了席姆斯的一篇文章说，美国现在维护着“腐化的、被人逐出的”蒋介石集团，这是未来的历史学家要觉得很奇怪的。他问道，“我们对这种不正义的事业投资了多少亿美元？我们准备为这个以及旁的疯狂计划牺牲多少美国人的生命？我们这样的按电钮的外交政策还能支持和苟延多久？”
    “基督教科学箴言报”6日刊载它的华盛顿记者斯特林格的一篇文章说，美国在金门问题上的态度是“不现实”的。他指出，甚至美国政府中一些有势力的人士也认为，这种顽固地保守一个外国港口中的岛屿的做法，不能使世人同情美国。
    “纽约时报”8日刊载了詹姆斯·雷斯顿的一篇文章指出，美国政府最近在台湾海峡地区采取的政策“在够入伍年岁的青年当中引起了不安”，他们对政府的政策不信任。雷斯顿说，“一位面临着征兵的聪明的美国青年本星期在这里讲了一番话，这番话比任何其他东西都更能说明首都人们的心情。他说，他绝不能希望得到足够的消息以便他自己可以正确地判断为了沿海岛屿金门和马祖同共产党中国作战是否明智，但是他认为没有权利相信政府正在以一种有条不紊的认真的方式对待它在中国问题上面临的问题。”
    雷斯顿还指出，美国现在向人民中国挑衅的政策甚至在美国国务院一些人士中也引起不安。
    “民族”周刊6日的社论说，“美国对红色中国的政策无异于今后无限期继续以往的错误。”社论说，地理学还没有完全过时，中国沿海岛屿同中国的厦门和福州港口的关系大致上相当于玛莎葡萄园同新百德福的关系。社论说，亚洲各中立国家也倾向于认为在这种前提下，中国要解放这些岛屿并不是不自然和不合理的。社论警告美国不要对中国进行疯狂的冒险。
    “华尔街日报”8日说，许多民主党议员也认为，中国沿海岛屿并不是那么重要，值得美国进行军事干涉。这家报纸说，华盛顿帮助蒋介石集团“保卫”这些岛屿的做法“远比7月中派遣美国海军陆战队到黎巴嫩去的做法更少得到人民的支持。”
    “纽约先驱论坛报”的玛格丽特·希金斯8日说，美国必须正视的是：随着时间的消逝，“蒋介石返回大陆”的机会实际上将不再存在，因此，在大部分世人看来，他的军队继续驻在离中国大陆很近的岛屿上“至少会证明越来越尴尬了。”
