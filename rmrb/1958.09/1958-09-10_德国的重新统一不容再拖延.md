The Reunification of Germany Cannot Be Delayed Any Longer
By Our Staff Commentator

　　On September 5, the government of the German Democratic Republic sent notes to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, requesting that the four countries prepare and sign a peace treaty with Germany, and suggested the establishment of a committee with representatives from the four countries to jointly discuss this issue. In a statement issued on the same day, the government of the German Democratic Republic also requested the government of West Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic to cooperate and make necessary preparations for peaceful negotiations. This new effort by the government of the German Democratic Republic once again proves its sincere desire to strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

　　Since the end of World War II, the policy pursued by the US, British, French, and West German governments of splitting Germany and turning West Germany into a hotbed of war has caused serious harm to peace in Europe and the world. West Germany's participation in the aggressive North Atlantic bloc and its armament with American atomic weapons have exacerbated the tense situation in Europe. In the recent US armed intervention in Lebanon, the West German government once again acted as an accomplice, providing West German bases for the use of American aggressors. All of this will not only further deepen the division of Germany but also carries the great danger of being dragged into a war of aggression by the United States. It is obviously not in the national interest of the German people.

　　The wish of the German people is to reunify Germany into a peaceful and democratic country. To achieve this goal, the German people have waged a long and arduous struggle against the US, British, French, and West German governments' conspiracy to split Germany. It is precisely the German people's unremitting struggle that has forced the Western countries and the Adenauer government to express, on the surface, their willingness for Germany to be reunified. However, they have always attempted to unify Germany through so-called "free elections." This is actually a way for the West German Adenauer regime to annex the German Democratic Republic. This arrogant attempt to disregard the German people's right to self-determination and the existence of the German Democratic Republic is fundamentally unworkable. On the contrary, it will only hinder the settlement of the German reunification issue.

　　In contrast to the attitude of Western countries and the West German government, the German Democratic Republic has made practical and feasible suggestions for resolving the German issue countless times. In its statement this time, the government of the German Democratic Republic, once again proceeding from the actual situation in Germany, advocated cooperation between the two German governments to make necessary preparations for peace negotiations. At the same time, the government of the German Democratic Republic also recognized the responsibility of the four major powers on the German issue and suggested the establishment of a committee with representatives from the four countries to discuss the preparation for signing a peace treaty with Germany. This approach, through the rapprochement between the two Germanys and the joint efforts of the four major powers, will help eliminate the stalemate on the German issue and lay a good foundation for the reunification of Germany.

　　Thirteen years have passed since the end of the war against Germany, but Germany still does not have a peace treaty, and the divided state of Germany continues. This is not permissible. Now, the government of the German Democratic Republic has once again put forward suggestions for resolving this issue, which is fully in line with the German people's desire for reunification. The US, British, French, and West German governments have an obligation to provide a responsible response to this.

　　德国的重新统一不容再拖延
　　本报评论员
    9月5日，德意志民主共和国政府照会苏、美、英、法四国政府，要求四国准备和德国签订一项对德和约，并建议成立一个有四国代表参加的委员会来共同商讨这一问题。在同一天发表的声明中，民主德国政府还要求西德政府和德意志民主共和国政府进行合作，为和平谈判进行必要的准备工作。德意志民主共和国政府的这一新的努力，再一次证明了它为争取祖国的和平统一的真诚愿望。
    第二次大战结束以来，美英法和西德政府所执行的分裂德国、并把西德变成战争策源地的政策已经对欧洲和世界的和平造成了严重的危害。西德参加侵略性的北大西洋集团，并用美国的原子武器装备起来，加剧了欧洲的紧张局势。而在最近美国武装干涉黎巴嫩的活动中，西德政府又为虎作伥，把西德的基地供美国侵略者使用。这一切不仅将进一步加深德国的分裂，而且有被美国拉入一场侵略战争的极大危险。它显然是不符合德国人民的民族利益。
    德国人民的愿望是要把德国重新统一成为一个和平、民主的国家。为了达到这个目的，德国人民跟美英法及西德政府分裂德国的阴谋曾经作了长期的、艰苦的斗争。正是德国人民坚持不懈的斗争迫使西方国家和阿登纳政府不得不在表面上也表示他们愿意德国重新得到统一。但是他们一直企图通过所谓“自由选举”来统一德国。这实际上就是由西德的阿登纳政权吞并民主德国的办法。这种无视德国人民自决权利、无视德意志民主共和国存在的狂妄企图，是根本行不通的。相反的，它只会阻挠德国统一问题的解决。
    和西方国家以及西德政府的这种态度相反，德意志民主共和国曾经无数次提出了解决德国问题的切实可行的建议。在它这一次所发表的声明中，民主德国政府再一次从德国的现实情况出发主张两个德国政府进行合作、为和平谈判进行必要的准备工作。同时民主德国政府也认识到四大国在德国问题上所负的责任，建议成立有四国代表参加的讨论准备签订对德和约的委员会。这样通过两个德国之间的接近和四大国的共同努力将有助于消除德国问题上的僵局，为德国的重新统一打下良好的基础。
    对德战争的结束已经十三年了，但是德国还没有一个和约、德国的分裂状态还在继续。这是不能容许的。现在民主德国政府再一次提出了解决这个问题的建议，这是完全符合德国人民要求重新统一的愿望的。美英法和西德政府有义务对此作出负责的回答。
