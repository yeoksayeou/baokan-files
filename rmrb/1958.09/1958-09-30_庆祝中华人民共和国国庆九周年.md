Celebrating the Ninth Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, Pei Qi

	Unprecedented harvests celebrate a bumper year,
	With rice and wheat yielding tons upon tons,
	No longer plagued by floods or droughts,
	The descendants are worthy successors to Shennong.

	Greening the mountains, a vibrant green sun red,
	North and south landscapes in a single view,
	Planting trees, nurturing people, new scenery abounds,
	Ten thousand broad mansions gleam with dew.

	Big-character posters, dragons and phoenixes dancing, fill the streets,
	Line upon line, reporting without cease,
	Daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act,
	Everyone strives to launch a satellite.

	People's Communes, People's Communes, celebrating initial success,
	Unifying workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers,
	With confidence, Xinyang took the lead,
	A high tide swept across the land with thunderous roar.

	International status rises (two poems)
	Red and expert, both internally and externally,
	The general program has been raised, a hundred plans unfurl,
	Laugh at the embargo of those few,
	The embargo only strengthens China.

	See clearly the main stream, strive for the upper reaches,
	More, faster, better, and more economical, build a grand plan,
	Riding the wind, cleaving the waves, all-powerful hands,
	Rising status, why seek it externally?

	The Great Leap Forward, one day equals twenty years,
	Marx's words are now believed even more,
	Grasping construction, grasping production,
	Surpassing England is imminent, quickly add the whip.

	Vietnam-China friendship, loving red flowers bloom freshly,
	The East wind's power is boundless,
	Brilliant successes greatly encourage us,
	Today's China is tomorrow's Vietnam.

    庆祝中华人民共和国国庆九周年
    越中友好协会会长  裴杞
    丰收史无前例庆丰年，稻麦离离吨百千，水不为灾旱消灭，神农之后子孙贤。
    绿化万山嫩绿太阳红，南北风光一望中，树木树人新景色，万间广厦露华重。
    大字报龙飞凤舞满街头，大字行行报不休，敢想敢言敢干活，人人争上卫星球。
    人民公社人民公社庆初成，统一工农商学兵，一自信阳发动后，高潮风卷震雷鸣。
    国际地位提高（两首）红透专深内外行，大纲已举百施张，笑他禁运二三子，禁运促成中国强。看清主流争上游，多快好省建远猷，乘风破浪万能手，地位提高岂外求。
    大跃进一天等于二十年，马说如今倍信然，手抓建设手生产，超英在即快加鞭。
    越中友谊友爱红花朵朵鲜，东风威力大无边，灿烂成功多鼓我，今天中国越明天。
