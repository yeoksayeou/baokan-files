　　Editor's note: To exchange experiences and promote the widespread blooming and fruiting of small blast furnaces in various regions, we will begin today to introduce several relatively good small blast furnace construction and production technologies for reference in various regions.
    The Anping Iron Plant in Lianyuan, Hunan, has two types of simple small blast furnaces that are relatively good. One type does not have hot blast equipment and uses cold air for production, so the coal gas is not utilized; the other type is a simple small blast furnace with a hot blast stove. This type of blast furnace has a more reasonable structure. Because it has a simple hot blast stove, it can use hot air to reduce the coke ratio. If the machine breaks down, a three-hour shutdown is not a problem.
    The effective volume of this simple small blast furnace is 2.6 cubic meters. It can produce one ton of iron per day and night, with an average occupied furnace volume of 0.4-0.5, and can produce 5.2 tons of iron per day and night. When the ratio of ore to coke is 1:1.5, qualified foundry pig iron can be produced. The investment for building such a small blast furnace is about 2,000 yuan per unit, and it can be completed in six to ten days. The cost per ton of iron produced is 150 yuan. Not only is the investment small and construction fast, but the requirements for raw materials and fuel are also very low, and it can be built in general scattered small mining areas.
    The furnace is best built in a place where the soil is hard. The foundation of the furnace is made of ordinary blue bricks, with a layer of rammed earth or cement underneath. The outer shell of the furnace is also made of ordinary blue bricks, 500 mm thick. The inner lining is 230 mm thick. The furnace bottom, hearth, and belly are made of acidic refractory bricks, and the furnace waist and body are rammed with quartz sand, white clay, and sodium silicate. The acidic lining is composed of: 75% white clay, 8% sodium silicate, and 77% quartz sand. Operating steps: First, bake the quartz sand with coal, then crush it into powder, sift it, and then mix it with white clay according to the ratio. Dilute the sodium silicate with an appropriate amount of water. After the three materials are mixed well, add water. The amount of water should be based on the principle of not being too dry or too wet. Before ramming, wooden molds should be made section by section according to the furnace shape curve, and the inside should be planed smooth (the part for building quartz sand). Add wooden supports to the diametrical parts of the cylinder. When ramming, tighten the inside with iron wire like building reinforced concrete. After the construction is complete, the furnace can be baked.
    This small blast furnace has only two tuyeres, one taphole, and one slag notch. In addition, a small hot blast stove is built to heat the air using coal gas, with an inlet air temperature of about 300 degrees Celsius. A small smoke cover is installed on the top of the furnace. The hot blast stove uses a single-row hot blast pipe with an outer diameter of 110 mm. There are eight pipes in total, four pipe bases, each base 2.9 meters high. The outer diameter of the cold air main pipe and the hot air main pipe is 200 mm. The heating area of the hot blast stove is 8 square meters. The power is 7 horsepower. The centrifugal blower is designed and manufactured by the Anping Iron Plant itself, running at 300 revolutions per minute, with an air volume of 12 to 15 cubic meters per minute.
    Furnace charge specifications: all calculated in millimeters, ore sand 3 to 15, coke 3 to 20, limestone 5 to 15, quartz stone 3 to 10, small iron less than 0.5 kg.
    Batching ratio: 60 kg of ore, 2 kg of limestone, 3 kg of quartz stone, 50 kg of coke, 5 kg to 15 kg of small iron.
    Labor allocation: two furnace operators and two top workers per shift, a total of twelve people per furnace.
    The technical operation of starting the furnace is as follows: After the outer shell of the furnace is built, bake it for 24 to 48 hours, and then build the inner lining. The inner lining should be built tightly, and the grout joints should preferably be less than 1 mm. After the inner lining is built, continue to bake the furnace. The higher the baking temperature, the better (furnace top waste gas 400 to 500 degrees Celsius).
    When starting the furnace, the charging operation is the same as that of ordinary blast furnaces. Place some flammable wood chips at the taphole in the hearth, and put dry firewood and charcoal inside to ignite. Then load coke above the hearth until the charge line. When starting the furnace, add acidic slag (50 kg of coke, 20 to 25 kg of small iron, 10 kg of acidic slag, 10 to 20 kg of ore). After ignition, allow natural ventilation for four hours, and then officially start blowing for production. After blowing, change the charge every four hours and gradually increase the coke load.
    During operation, open the taphole and slag notch frequently, and discharge slag and iron once every hour. The operating slogan put forward by this factory is to frequently discharge slag and iron, frequently check the tuyeres, frequently stir, and frequently add charge. Most of the slag from small blast furnaces is black, glassy, and has good fluidity. Therefore, the slag should not be too alkaline, otherwise the fluidity will decrease, and in severe cases, the furnace will die. Also, the air supply should not be reduced or stopped. If the air supply is stopped for more than four hours, the hearth will freeze. If the machine fails and the air supply needs to be stopped, empty coke must be added first, the charge changed, and the furnace must be quenched.

　　涟源安平铁厂简易矮高炉
　　编者按：为了交流经验，促使各地小高炉普遍开花结果，我们从今天起陆续介绍几种比较好的小高炉的建造技术和生产技术，供各地参考。
    湖南涟源安平铁厂有两种简易小高炉比较好。其中一种是没有热风设备的，用冷风生产，这种高炉的煤气没有被利用；另一种是有热风炉的简易矮高炉，这种高炉结构比较合理，因为有简单的热风炉，可以利用热风降低焦比，如果机器发生故障，休风三小时没有什么问题。
    这座简易矮高炉的有效容积是二点六立方公尺，每昼夜炼一吨铁，平均占用的炉体容积是零点四—零点五，每昼夜可以炼五点二吨铁。当矿石和焦炭的比例为一比一点五的时候，可以炼出合格的铸造生铁。建设这样的小高炉每座投资约两千元，六天到十天就可以建成。每炼一吨铁，成本是一百五十元。不但投资少，建设快，对原料燃料要求也很低，在一般零散的小型矿区都可以兴建。
    炉子最好选择在土质坚硬的地方建造。炉的基础用普通青砖砌成，下面铺一层三合土或者水泥。炉的外壳也是用普通青砖砌的，厚五百公厘，炉内衬部厚二百三十公厘，炉底、炉缸、炉腹用酸性耐火砖，炉腰、炉身用石英砂、白粘泥、矽酸钠捣固。酸性炉衬配料成分为：白粘泥75％，矽酸钠8％，石英砂77％。操作步骤：先将石英砂用煤焙烧，然后破碎成粉，过筛，再按比例掺入白泥，矽酸钠中适当加水稀蚀，三种料配好后搅匀，并加水，水量的多少，以不干不湿为原则。在捣固前，应按炉形曲线分节做好木模，里面刨光（筑石英砂的部分），圆筒的对径部分加木撑支架。捣固时同筑钢筋混凝土一样，里面用铁丝插紧，筑完后，就可以烘炉。
    这种小高炉只有两个风口，一个铁口，一个渣口。另外还建立一座小热风炉，利用煤气加热，入炉风温摄氏三百度左右。炉顶安一个小烟盖。热风炉是用一字型热风管，管外径为一百一十公厘，共有八根，四个管座，每座高二点九公尺。冷风总管和热风总管外径为二百公厘。热风炉受热面积为八平方公尺。动力是七马力，离心鼓风机是安平铁厂自行设计自己制造的，每分钟三百转，风量是每分钟十二至十五立方公尺。
    炉料规格：都按公厘计算，矿砂为三到十五，焦炭三到二十，石灰石五到十五，石英石三到十，小铁半公斤以下。
    配料比例：矿石六十公斤，石灰石二公斤，石英石三公斤，焦炭五十公斤，小铁五公斤到十五公斤。
    劳动力配备：每班炉前工二人，炉顶工二人，每炉共计十二人。
    开炉的技术操作如下：炉的外壳砌好后，烘二十四到四十八小时，然后再砌内衬。内衬要砌得致密，灰缝最好在一公厘以下。内衬砌好后继续烘炉，烘炉温度越高越好（炉顶废气摄氏四百到五百度）。
    开炉时踩料操作同一般高炉相同，在炉缸铁渣口的地方，装些易燃的碎木片，里边装干柴和木炭引火。炉缸以上再装焦炭，直到料线为止，开炉时配酸性炉渣（焦炭五十公斤，小铁二十到二十五公斤，酸性炉渣十公斤，矿砂十到二十公斤），点火后，自然通风四小时，再正式鼓风生产，鼓风后，要每隔四小时变料一次，逐步提高焦炭负荷。
    操作时，多打开铁渣口，每隔一小时出渣出铁一次。这个厂提出的操作口号是勤出渣出铁、勤检查风嘴，勤掏搅，勤加料。矮高炉的渣大部分是黑色，玻璃状，流动性好，因此，渣不能过碱，否则流动性降低，严重时会死炉。也不能减风和休风，如果休风超过四小时，炉缸就会冻结，如机器发生故障，需要休风时，必须先下空焦，变料，进行焖炉。
