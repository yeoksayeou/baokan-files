Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: Taipei dispatch: The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the instigation of the United States, is further intensifying its persecution of Taiwanese youth. The Chiang gang's Ministry of Education and the reactionary organization "Youth Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps" recently held a series of meetings, formulating a set of measures to intensify the coercion of Taiwanese students to undergo American-style military training by the Chiang bandit troops, stipulating that it will be implemented starting this semester. In this so-called "Outline of the Plan for Improving Military Training Education in Schools," it is stipulated that all schools in Taiwan, from junior high school Boy Scout training to senior high school and university military training and reserve officer training, must be intensified. The content of the training, in addition to instilling reactionary ideas, also includes lectures on American war history and the so-called "glorious war history" of the Chiang bandit troops. Students are also forced to undergo centralized training every summer vacation. Detention rooms and prisons are widely set up in the training camps. The US imperialism and the Chiang gang attempt to use these trainings and persecutions to complete the pre-military officer and pre-military sergeant induction training of Taiwan's university and middle school students in a shorter period of time, so that they can be driven to join the Chiang bandit army at any time.

Currently, the Chiang gang's Ministry of Education has issued a notice to all universities and middle schools in Taiwan to implement this method of persecuting Taiwanese youth starting this semester. However, Taiwanese youth are by no means willing to be cannon fodder for the US-Chiang clique. They have already expressed extreme hatred for the Chiang gang's so-called "military training" and have tried every means to escape this training. Even the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique cannot but admit that since the widespread implementation of military training in Taiwanese schools at all levels in 1953, students have become increasingly unwilling to accept this training, and they despise the Chiang army instructors, calling them "rice buckets," "hooligans," and "warlords," etc., making them "feel extremely uncomfortable," and therefore the work is not "ideal." For this reason, Zhou Zhirou, chairman of the Chiang gang's Taiwan Province, recently issued instructions to these "military training instructors," asking them to adopt deceptive methods or even more brutal means against unarmed students to "reverse this trend that is not conducive to school military training."

    日暮途穷加紧收罗炮灰
    蒋介石集团疯狂迫害台湾青年
    新华社广州16日电　台北消息：蒋介石卖国集团在美国指使下，正进一步加紧迫害台湾青年。蒋帮教育部和反动组织“青年反共救国团”最近举行了一连串的会议，拟订了一套加紧胁迫台湾学生受蒋贼军的美式军事训练的办法，规定从本学期开始实施。在这个所谓“学校军训教育改进计划大纲”中，规定了台湾各学校从初中童子军训练到高中、大学的军训和预备军官训练都要加紧进行。训练的内容除灌输反动思想以外，还讲授美国战史和蒋贼军的所谓“光荣战史”等。每年暑假还强迫学生集中训练。集训营中广泛设立禁闭室和牢房等。美帝国主义和蒋帮企图通过这些训练和迫害，在更短的时间内把台湾大学和中学学生都完成预备军官和预备士官的入伍训练，以便随时驱押他们加入蒋贼军。
    目前，蒋帮教育部已通令台湾各大学和中学，在本学期开始实施这个迫害台湾青年的办法。但是，台湾青年绝不甘愿去给美蒋当炮灰，他们过去已经对蒋帮的所谓“军事训练”表示极端憎恶，想尽了各种办法逃避这个训练。连蒋介石卖国集团也不能不承认自1953年台湾各级学校普遍实施军训以来，学生们愈来愈不愿接受这种训练，并且对蒋军教官十分鄙视，把他们叫做“饭桶”、“流氓”、“军阀”等，使他们“感觉空气极为难受”，因而工作进行并不“理想”。为此，蒋帮台湾省主席周至柔最近向这些“军训教官”们发出指示，要他们对手无寸铁的学生采取欺骗办法或者更加凶暴手段，去“挽回这种不利于学校军训工作的风气”。
