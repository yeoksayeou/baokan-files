The French People's Struggle Against the Dictatorial "Constitution"
By Jean Vidal, Reporter for the French "l'Humanité"

    Since De Gaulle came to power on June 1, France has been ruled by a personal military dictatorship imposed by force and threats. This rule, supported by the most reactionary strata and the most stubborn colonialists of the big bourgeoisie, is trying to open the door to fascism in France.

    However, the French people do not want fascist rule. Powerful French democratic forces are doing their utmost to block the path of fascism. Fascism has no foundation among the French people. It is only supported by some professional officers in certain specialized units – such as paratrooper units – that are used by the bourgeoisie to suppress colonial independence movements.

    If De Gaulle was able to come to power by exploiting the threat of civil war, it only shows that his rise to power was due to the division of French democratic forces. Now De Gaulle is trying to perpetuate his dictatorship and arrange a constitutional basis for it. This is the purpose of the referendum to be held on September 28.

    The new "Constitution" created by De Gaulle fully reflects De Gaulle's own image. It is an out-and-out monarchical constitution which, under the guise of a republic, establishes a new monarch in France with all powers, excluding the representatives elected by the people. It was a significant move for De Gaulle to announce his "Constitution" to journalists standing under a portrait of Napoleon III.

    To understand the stakes of the upcoming referendum in France, it is necessary to first make a simple analysis of De Gaulle's "Constitution."

    The preamble to the Constitution, which stipulates various human and social rights, has been reduced to a few lines hinting at the scope of De Gaulle's autocracy.

    De Gaulle's "Constitution" deletes many guarantees stipulated in the 1946 Constitution, the most significant of which are: the right to equality between men and women, the right to work, the right to unionize, the right to strike, and equal opportunities for children to receive education in non-religious compulsory education institutions.

    De Gaulle only mentioned the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1789 and the Constitution of 1946 briefly, without elaborating on these basic rights in any way, so that he could interpret them in various ways.

    The current constitution stipulates: "Everyone has the duty to work and enjoys the right to employment, and his work or profession shall not be prejudiced by his origin, political views, or beliefs." This passage is also missing from De Gaulle's "Constitution." Isn't this a particularly significant matter?

    Chapter 1 of De Gaulle's "Constitution" also does not include the following clause from the 1946 Constitution: "In all matters, the National Assembly deputies elected by universal, equal, direct, and secret elections exercise national sovereignty." This omission means that deputies elected by the people and possibly controlled by voters are no longer representatives of national sovereignty.

    De Gaulle clearly intends to act as the President of the Republic, and the "Constitution" gives this President the absolute power possessed by a monarch.

    The Prime Minister and ministers are appointed by the President. The President is responsible for negotiating and ratifying treaties. The President is the head of the military. The President presides over the Council of Ministers and promulgates laws. The President also presides over the federation formed with overseas territories.

    Even though the National Assembly is in a weak position according to De Gaulle's "Constitution," the President can also dissolve the parliament when he thinks the National Assembly is hindering him.

    Moreover, the Prince-President (a title given to Napoleon III by Hugo, here referring to De Gaulle – translator's note) is elected by an electoral college composed of dignitaries who in no way represent public opinion.

    As for the government appointed by the Prince-President, it cannot be dismissed according to De Gaulle's arrangements. This government has seized the power to formulate "regulations" from the parliament and has the right to declare martial law by decree.

    Article 14 of De Gaulle's "Constitution" expresses a presumptuous demand that even Pétain dared not make. According to Article 14, when the national system, national independence, and territorial integrity are "threatened," the President has the right to "take measures as required by the situation." In this way, the President can demand absolute power at any time.

    Finally, national administrative and military personnel are also personally appointed by the President. In other words, De Gaulle can install his fascists in public and military positions at all levels.

    As for overseas territories, De Gaulle's "Constitution" stipulates that, apart from foreign policy, defense, currency, fiscal and economic policy, the exploitation of strategic materials, justice, and higher education, which are still controlled by French colonialists, overseas territories can freely manage their own affairs. One cannot help but ask: apart from the above-mentioned affairs, what else can be "freely managed"!

    De Gaulle's "Constitution" remains silent on the Algerian issue.

    It can be seen that De Gaulle's "Constitution" means the demise of the French Republic and the "legalization" of a dictatorial system.

    The perverse acts of De Gaulle's "Constitution" have even aroused opposition from people who have always maintained a passive attitude. De Gaulle has made great efforts to promote his "Constitution." Generally speaking, De Gaulle has two arguments: on the one hand, in order to ease public opinion's opposition to his anti-republican intentions, De Gaulle claims that he does not want to interfere with public freedoms. However, his draft "Constitution" proves that his words and deeds do not match. On the other hand, De Gaulle threatens that if his draft "Constitution" is rejected, civil war will occur.

    Under the command of Soustelle, the newly appointed Minister of Propaganda by De Gaulle, French radio, television, and some newspapers have spread these arguments in large quantities.

    Despite having various propaganda tools, De Gaulle still has no certainty. He feels that his position is becoming increasingly unstable. This is the reason why De Gaulle is rushing to Africa, trying to obtain votes from overseas territories. However, contrary to his wishes, the trip to Africa was a failure. The African people have expressed clear opposition to De Gaulle's draft "Constitution," which attempts to keep them in a colonial status.

    In Algeria, fighters of the National Liberation Front are launching various attacks against the paratroopers who are trying to coerce the people into voting with violence. On September 19, the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic was established in Cairo, which will further strengthen the Algerian people's struggle against De Gaulle's "Constitution."

    In mainland France, the opposition to De Gaulle's draft "Constitution" comes from two main aspects: first, the existence of the powerful French Communist Party, the election results of which prove that the French Communist Party has more than 25% of the voters; second, the fact that democratic forces are deeply rooted in France and that left-wing forces have the upper hand.

    The French Communist Party is the largest party in France. One out of every four voters votes for the Communist Party. The French Communist Party, tempered in the arduous struggle against the French bourgeoisie and against foreign occupiers, has gained new prestige among the people. The leaders of the French Communist Party have been sharp-sighted in leading the anti-De Gaulle struggle, and the struggle has proved the correctness of their decisions.

    In the parliament, when all the parties were divided or succumbed due to fear or threats, the Communist Party deputies calmly exposed the fascist conspiracy in all aspects from the parliamentary podium.

    The soldiers of the French Communist Party have shown their combativeness. They have united around the party day and night to resist all provocations from the fascists.

    Therefore, among all those who advocate the republic – who account for the majority of French people – the prestige of the French Communist Party has greatly increased.

    The current task is to expose the illusions spread by De Gaulle's propaganda and created by people like Mollet who betray French democracy.

    The "socialist" Mollet should bear great responsibility. He is willing to serve the most reactionary bourgeoisie and takes anti-communism as the only principle of action. Mollet used all the power he possessed in the Socialist Party to pave the way for De Gaulle's rise to power. Now he has joined De Gaulle's dictatorial government.

    Mollet's attitude has awakened many members of the Socialist Party, which is actually in a state of division. However, despite the growing strength of the forces opposing Mollet's betrayal policy in recent months, Mollet was still able to gather a majority at the Socialist Party Congress held on September 14. This is because the "representatives" attending the congress were selected from Mollet's supporters in various provinces, and they could not reflect the opinions of the majority of Socialists in those provinces. When support at the lower level wavers, Mollet grasps the leadership of the Socialist Party by this deceptive method.

    However, Mollet's deception has not been able to prevent the split of the Socialist Party. Some Socialist Party leaders, including Édouard Depreux, a member of the Seine Provincial Council and former minister, and Daniel Mayer, who opposed De Gaulle's "Constitution," have announced their withdrawal from the Socialist Party and formed an "Independent Socialist Party."

    Other influential political figures, such as Mendès-France and other leaders of the Radical Socialist Party, have also called for a vote against De Gaulle's "Constitution."

    In the divided working class, despite the tricks of the Workers' Force Confederation (Socialist Party) and the French Confederation of Christian Workers (Catholic), the call for united action by the French General Confederation of Labor, which unites 60% to 80% of factory workers, has received increasing response.

    Based on the current situation, the French Communist Party clearly points out that the only way is to gather the strength of all French republicans and say "no" to De Gaulle's "Constitution."

    The division of French democratic forces allowed De Gaulle to come to power by relying on military force. The unity of democratic forces will drive him out of power.

    The unity of republican forces has been achieved in many regions. Thousands of Committees for the Defense of the Republic have been established throughout France. They have struck the fascists everywhere. People like Bigeard and the fascist General Chassin cannot hold a public meeting anywhere in France, because whenever they try to imitate the Algiers rioters and organize so-called "Committees of National Salvation" in a city, the republicans of that city unite and drive them away.

    On September 4, when De Gaulle himself "presented" his "Constitution" in "Republic Square," even with the use of loudspeakers, De Gaulle's voice was still drowned out by the roar of tens of thousands of demonstrators, "Never let fascism succeed!" and "Long live the Republic!"

    The unity of democrats and republicans should not primarily be the unity of leaders from the upper levels, from different parties, and from different organizations. It should be unity in common action against De Gaulle and against fascism throughout the country.

    The French working class has had two similar experiences of unity, although those two unities were not solid. One was the Popular Front in 1936, and the other was the unity in 1945, after the liberation from German occupation. This kind of unity among leaders cannot resolutely resist the enemy's attacks, nor can it prevent betrayal.

    Therefore, the French Communist Party now advocates that workers in factories, farmers in rural areas, and residents in urban districts should elect committees for the defense of the republic to promote the concretization of unity.

    Under the call of the Party Central Committee, the French Communists have fully devoted themselves to the struggle to establish a network of committees for the defense of the republic elected by the people throughout the country. In these committees, Communists, Socialists, and other republicans unite to strive for the victory of the movement to say "no" to De Gaulle on September 28.

    No matter what the final result of the referendum organized by De Gaulle is, the united front of French democratic and progressive forces will eventually defeat the dictator and his fascist clique.

    法国人民反对独裁“宪法”的斗争
    法国“人道报”记者  让·维达尔
    自从6月1日戴高乐上台以来，法国受着由武力和威胁所强加的个人军事独裁的统治。这个统治从最反动的阶层和大资产阶级最顽固的殖民主义者那里，找到了支持，力谋在法国打开走向法西斯的大门。
    可是，法国人民不要法西斯统治，强大的法国民主力量正在以全力来堵塞法西斯的道路。法西斯主义在法国人民群众中并没有基础，支持它的不过是被资产阶级利用来镇压殖民地独立运动的某些专门化部队——例如伞兵部队——中的一些职业军官。
    如果说戴高乐利用了内战的威胁得以上台执政，那只是说明他的上台是由于法国民主力量的分裂。现在戴高乐企图使他的独裁永久化，并且为他的独裁安排一个宪法的基础。这就是9月28日即将举行的公民投票的目的。
    戴高乐制造的新“宪法”，充分描绘了戴高乐自己的面貌。这是不折不扣的一部君主国家宪法，它假借共和国的名义，为法国立了一个拥有一切权力的新君主，排斥了人民所选出的代表。戴高乐站在拿破仑第三的肖像下，向新闻记者宣布他的“宪法”，是一个意味深长的举动。
    为了了解即将在法国举行的公民投票的利害关系，必须首先对戴高乐的“宪法”作一个简单的分析。
    规定各项人权和社会权利的宪法序言，被缩减为寥寥可数的、暗示着戴高乐专权的范围的几行字。
    戴高乐“宪法”删除了1946年宪法中所规定的许多保证，其中最显著的是：男女平等的权利，工作权利，工会权利，罢工权利，儿童在非宗教义务教育机关获得教育的均等机会。
    戴高乐只略略提了一下1789年的人权宣言与1946年的宪法，并没有对这些基本权利作任何阐述，这样，他就可以对它们作各种不同的解释。
    现行宪法规定：“任何人有工作之义务，并享有就业之权利，其工作或职业不得因其出身、政见或信仰而受妨害。”这一段话在戴高乐“宪法”里也不见了。难道这不是一件具有特别意义的事情吗？
    戴高乐“宪法”第一章，也没有把1946年宪法的以下条款包括进去：“在一切事情上，国民以普遍、平等、直接、秘密选举选出的国民议会议员行使国家主权。”这种省略意味着：由人民选出、并且可能由选民控制的议员，不再是国家主权的代表。
    戴高乐显然企图充当共和国总统，而“宪法”就赋予这位总统以一个君主所拥有的绝对权力。
    内阁总理与各部部长是由总统任命的。总统负责谈判并批准条约。总统是军事的首脑。总统主持部长会议并颁布法律。总统也主持与海外领地结成的联邦。
    尽管按照戴高乐“宪法”，国民议会已经处于软弱无力的地位，可是当总统认为国民议会对他有妨碍时，他还可以解散议会。
    而且，亲王总统（亲王总统是雨果给予拿破仑第三的称号，此处指戴高乐——译注）是由一些丝毫不能代表民意的显要人物组成的选举团而选出的。
    至于由亲王总统所任命的政府，按照戴高乐的安排是不能罢免的。这个政府从议会夺取了制订“条例”的权力，并且有权以法令宣布戒严。
    戴高乐“宪法”第十四条，表达了连贝当也不敢提出的狂妄要求。根据第十四条，当国家体制、民族独立、领土完整感受“威胁”时，总统有权“根据形势的需要采取措施。”这样，总统就可以随时要求绝对权力。
    最后，国家行政人员和军事人员也是由总统亲自任命的，换而言之，戴高乐可以把他的法西斯分子安插在各级公职和军职中。
    至于海外领地，戴高乐“宪法”规定，除了外交政策、国防、货币、财政经济政策、战略物资的开采、司法和高等教育仍由法国殖民者掌管以外，海外领地可以自由地管理自己的事务。人们不禁要问：除了上述的一些事务以外，还有什么可以“自由地管理的事务”！
    对于阿尔及利亚问题，戴高乐“宪法”保持沉默。
    人们可以看出，戴高乐“宪法”意味着法兰西共和国的灭亡和独裁制度的“合法”化。
    戴高乐“宪法”的倒行逆施，甚至于引起了向来保持消极态度的人的反对。戴高乐为宣传他的“宪法”作了极大的努力。总的说来，戴高乐有两个论点：一方面为了缓和舆论对他的反共和意图的反对，戴高乐声称不愿干涉公众的自由。可是他的“宪法”草案证明了他的言行不符。另方面，戴高乐威胁说，如果他的“宪法”草案被拒绝，就会发生内战。
    在新近由戴高乐任命的宣传部长苏斯戴尔的指挥下，法国的无线电、电视以及一部分报刊大量散布这些论点。
    虽然拥有各样宣传手段，戴高乐仍旧没有任何把握。他感觉自己的地位日益不稳。这就是戴高乐仆仆于非洲道上，企图获得海外领地选票的原因。然而，事与愿违，非洲的旅行是一个失败。非洲人民对这个企图使他们停留在殖民地地位上的戴高乐“宪法”草案，表示了明显的反对。
    在阿尔及利亚，民族解放阵线的战士们，给那些企图用暴力胁迫人民进行投票的伞兵以各种打击。9月19日，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府已在开罗宣布成立，这将进一步加强阿尔及利亚人民反对戴高乐“宪法”的斗争。
    在法国本土，戴高乐“宪法”草案遭受的反对来自两个主要的方面：首先是强大的法国共产党的存在，选举结果证明，法国共产党拥有25％以上的选民；其次是民主力量在法国根深蒂固、左派力量占有优势的事实。
  法国共产党是法国的第一个大党。每四个投票人中就有一个人投共产党的票。在反对法国资产阶级、反对外国占领者的艰苦斗争中锻炼出来的法国共产党，在人民群众中获得了新的威望。法国共产党的领导人在领导反戴高乐的斗争中，眼光敏锐，斗争证明了他们的决定的正确性。
    在议会里，当所有的党派由于惧怕或感受威胁而陷于分裂或屈服的时候，共产党议员从容不迫地在议会的讲坛上，从各方面揭露了法西斯的阴谋。
    法国共产党的战士们表现了他们的战斗性，他们日日夜夜地团结在党的周围，抗击法西斯分子的一切挑衅。
    因此，在一切主张共和的人们——他们占法国人的大多数——中间，法国共产党的威信大大地增加了。
    目前的任务在于揭破戴高乐分子的宣传所散播的、以及由摩勒这样出卖法国民主的人所造成的幻象。
    “社会主义者”摩勒应负极大的责任。他甘愿为最反动的资产阶级效劳，以反共为唯一的行动原则。摩勒利用了他在社会党所拥有的全部力量，来为戴高乐的上台开辟道路。现在他参加了戴高乐的独裁政府。
    摩勒的态度已经使实际上处于分裂状态的社会党中不少的成员醒悟过来。不过，尽管最近几个月以来反对摩勒背叛政策的势力日趋强大，摩勒仍然能够在9月14日举行的社会党代表大会上，又一次纠集了多数。这是由于参加代表大会的“代表”，是自各省的摩勒拥护者中遴选的，他们并不能反映各该省大多数社会党人的意见。当下层的支持发生动摇的时候，摩勒就凭这个欺骗的方法掌握了社会党的领导。
    但是，摩勒的欺骗并没有能够阻止社会党的分裂。包括曾担任过部长的塞纳省议员爱德华·德普勒和丹尼埃·麦耶等在内的一些反对戴高乐“宪法”的一些社会党领袖，已宣布退出社会党，而另组织了一个“独立社会党”。
    其他有势力的政治人物如孟戴斯—弗朗斯和激进社会党其他领导人士，也呼吁投票反对戴高乐“宪法”。
    在被分裂的工人阶级中，尽管有工人力量总工会（社会党）、法国天主教劳工联盟（天主教）的诡计，团结着60％至80％的工厂工人的法国总工会提出的关于团结起来行动的号召，受到愈来愈大的响应。
    根据目前的情势，法国共产党明确地指出：应该集合法国一切共和人士的力量，向戴高乐“宪法”说“不”，这是唯一的道路。
    法国民主力量的分裂，让戴高乐凭借军事力量上了台。民主力量的团结，就会把他赶下台来。
    共和人士力量的团结，在不少的地区已经实现了。在法国全境成立了数千个保卫共和国委员会。它们到处打击了法西斯分子。像布热德和法西斯将军夏申之流，在法国任何地方都无法举行一次公开的大会，因为无论他们在哪一个城市里企图仿效阿尔及尔暴乱分子的办法组织所谓“救国委员会”的时候，那个城市的共和人士就团结起来把他们赶掉。
    9月4日，当戴高乐本人在“共和国广场”上“提出”他的“宪法”时，虽然有扩音器，戴高乐的声音仍旧被数万示威者“决不让法西斯得逞”、“共和国万岁”的怒吼所掩没。
    民主人士、共和人士的团结，不应该首先只是上层的、不同的政党、不同的组织的领导人物的团结。它应该是全国范围内反对戴高乐、反对法西斯主义的共同行动中的团结。
    法国工人阶级有过两次类此的团结经验，虽然那两次的团结并不巩固。一次是1936年的人民阵线，另一次是1945年，从德国占领下解放以后的团结。这种在领导人物之间的团结，无法坚决抗拒敌人的打击，也不能杜绝背叛活动。
    所以，现在法国共产党主张由工厂的工人、乡村的农民、城市的各区居民选举组成保卫共和国委员会，促使团结具体化。
    法国共产党人在党中央的号召下，全力投入斗争，以求在全国建立由人民选举组成的保卫共和国委员会网。在这些委员会里，共产党人、社会党人、其他共和人士大家团结一致，争取9月28日向戴高乐说“不”的运动的胜利。
    无论戴高乐所组织的公民投票最后的结果是什么，法国民主和进步力量的团结一致，最后必将击败独裁者和他的法西斯集团。
