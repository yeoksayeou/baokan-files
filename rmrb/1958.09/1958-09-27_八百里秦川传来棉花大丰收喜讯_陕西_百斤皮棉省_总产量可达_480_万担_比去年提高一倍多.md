(Our newspaper's report from Xi'an on the 26th) Shaanxi Province is currently filled with the joyous news of an unprecedented bumper cotton harvest. The province, one that has never before produced a hundred jin of ginned cotton, is about to emerge here. Young women are busily picking the opened bottom bolls. Carts laden with cotton are steadily heading towards the state purchasing stations. The cotton ginning machines in thousands upon thousands of villages are whirring loudly.

This year, Shaanxi Province planted over 4.7 million mu of cotton fields, and it is predicted that the total output will reach over 4.8 million dan, more than double the highest total cotton output in the province after liberation in 1957. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu could reach 101.6 jin, an increase of 110.8% compared to last year's yield of 48.2 jin per mu, successfully completing the plan of averaging 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

The twelve inspection teams organized by the province and the yield assessment teams organized by local Party and government departments, along with local actual measurements and calculations, show that in general, a hundred cotton bolls can be shelled into one jin of seed cotton, and 2.6 to 2.7 jin of seed cotton can be ginned into one jin of ginned cotton. In the 291,000 mu of cotton fields in Wugong, Chang'an, and the suburbs of Xi'an and Xianyang, there are an average of 4,000 plants per mu, each plant with fifteen old cotton bolls. There are a total of 60,000 bolls per mu, and each mu can produce more than 200 jin of ginned cotton. Currently, farmers throughout the province are universally picking cotton, and the actual harvest results prove that the yields measured in various places are guaranteed. In Dali County's 170,000 mu of cotton fields, after actual measurements by Party committees at all levels and the masses, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu can reach 120 jin. Now, only half has been picked, and more than 60 jin of ginned cotton has been picked per mu.

The abundance of large-area high-yield cotton and high-yield plots is a characteristic of this year's bumper cotton harvest in Shaanxi Province. The more than 8,000 mu of cotton fields planted in Shuangwang Township, Weinan County, can average 300 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The one mu of cotton field cultivated by Zhang Qiuxiang, a cotton planting model in this township, can yield more than 1,550 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

The bumper cotton harvest in Shaanxi Province this year has greatly encouraged the workers in textile factories. In the "Textile City" in the suburbs of Xi'an, workers put forward the slogan of "striving for high output, high speed, high efficiency, improving quality, and reducing costs." When the personnel from the state-owned Northwest Third Cotton Textile Factory who were sent to Weinan, Tongguan, and other counties to understand the cotton production situation returned, they conveyed the good news of the unprecedented bumper cotton harvest to the workers. Currently, the factory has increased the speed of the looms from 176 revolutions per minute to 205, with the highest reaching 215; the number of shifts has increased from the original eighteen shifts per week to twenty shifts, accelerating the production of large quantities of high-quality cotton cloth.

    八百里秦川传来棉花大丰收喜讯
    陕西——百斤皮棉省
    总产量可达480万担  比去年提高一倍多
    本报西安26日电  陕西省目前到处传颂着今年棉花空前大丰产的喜讯。我国历史上从未有过的百斤皮棉省将在这里出现。姑娘们开始忙碌地收摘已经松软的脚花。一辆辆满载棉花的大车，正源源地向国家收购站驶去。成千成万个村子里的轧花机，也正在高声喧嚷着。
    今年，陕西省播种的四百七十多万亩棉田，据预测总产量可达到四百八十多万担，比解放后全省棉花总产量最高的1957年提高一倍以上。平均亩产皮棉可达到一百零一点六斤，比去年亩产四十八点二斤提高110.8％，胜利地完成了平均每亩一百斤皮棉的计划。
    全省组织的十二个检查团和各地党政部门组织的测产组和各地实测计算，全省今年一般都是一百个棉桃，就可剥一斤籽棉，二点六、七斤籽棉可轧出一斤皮棉。武功、长安和西安、咸阳市郊区的二十九万一千亩棉田，平均每亩有四千株，每株有十五个老棉桃。每亩共有六万个桃子，每亩可产到二百多斤皮棉。目前，全省农民正在普遍拾花，从实际收获的情况证明：各地实测的产量也是有保证的。大荔县十七万亩棉田，经过各级党委和群众实测，平均每亩可产皮棉一百二十斤，现在只拾到一半，每亩就拾到皮棉六十多斤。
    大面积丰产棉花和高额丰产地块多，是今年陕西省棉花丰产的特点。渭南县双王乡播种的八千多亩棉田，平均每亩可达到三百斤皮棉。这个乡植棉模范张秋香培育的一亩棉田，亩产可达一千五百五十多斤皮棉。
    陕西省今年棉花大丰收，给纺织厂的职工们极大的鼓舞。在西安市郊的“纺织城”里，职工们提出了“力争高产、高速、高效，提高质量，降低成本”的口号。国营西北第三棉纺织厂派出到渭南、潼关等县了解棉花生产情况的人一回来，就向职工们传达了农民获得棉花空前大丰收的喜讯。目前全厂已将每分钟织布机的转速由一百七十六提高为二百零五，最高的达到二百一十五；班次由原来的每星期十八班增加到二十班，加速生产大批的质量很好的棉布。
