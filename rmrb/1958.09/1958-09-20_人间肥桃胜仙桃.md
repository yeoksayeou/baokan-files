    Human World's Fat Peach Surpasses Immortal Peach
    Yuè Rén
    According to the People's Daily on September 3rd: "Juicy and sweet fat peaches are ripe. 45,000 peach trees in Feicheng County, Shandong Province, have all announced a bumper harvest… Each tree bears 300 to 400 peaches, each weighing over one jin. …Among them, more than 200 'satellite peaches' each weigh two jin already, and are expected to grow to over three jin in half a month…” A peach actually weighs three jin, isn't that bigger than a pomelo? This fat peach, among all kinds of peaches, originally grows relatively large. It used to be a tribute to the Qing Dynasty imperial family. A famous pomologist wrote in his small booklet: "More than twenty years ago, the author went to Feicheng for investigation. Among the specimens collected, the largest peach weighed one jin. In 1954, the author… saw a specimen of the largest fat peach at Shandong Agricultural College in Jinan, weighing one jin and six liang.” He then exclaimed: "This can be regarded as the largest peach in the world!" This exclamation was premature! Know that the world's largest peach should be looked for in the present day.
    This year, peaches are not only numerous and large, but also of high quality: bright in color, rich in fragrance, sweet in taste, and juicy. The world-renowned Fenghua Yu Lu peach of Zhejiang is fresh, sweet and juicy. When eating it, there is no need to peel it. Just use a straw to insert into the peach skin and suck it, leaving only the peach skin in the end, without any waste.
    Peaches originally grew in the high altitude areas of 1,800 to 6,300 feet in Shaanxi, Gansu and other places in our country. They were wild. Later, through our ancestors' painstaking planting and management, they became cultivated peaches. They should be regarded as one of the earliest fruit trees in the world. The "Peach Tree Tender" chapter in the Book of Songs, Zhou Nan, has descriptions such as "The peach tree is tender and young, Its leaves are luxuriant." which specially praises the peach; the "Wooden Melon" chapter in the Book of Songs, Wei Feng, has the sentence "They threw me a wooden peach, I repaid them with a jasper gem."; and there are two chapters of "Garden has peaches" in Wei Feng. The Book of Rites also has a record of "Peach is called 'dǎn zi'". It can be seen that peach cultivation was quite common in our country as early as three thousand years ago. Now cultivated peaches are all over the country, and wild peaches have not yet become extinct. It is ridiculous that some botanists in capitalist countries, because their predecessors saw many peach trees in Persia (now Iran), arbitrarily said that peaches originated in Persia. Now let them gain some knowledge: Persian peaches were introduced from our country. Peaches originated in our country, and then gradually spread overseas, westward to Europe, eastward to Korea and Japan. They were introduced to the Americas more than 320 years ago.
    The maturity period of peaches was originally only in summer and autumn. In 1953, Northwest Agricultural College began to study and experiment on how to make peach trees bear fruit in winter. Now a new variety that matures in October has been developed, called "Northwest Winter Peach"; and a new variety that matures in December is also promising. They issued a bold statement: people will be able to eat delicious peaches for eight or nine months of the year (from June to January)! This is entirely possible. Winter peaches were once cultivated in our country two thousand years ago, but unfortunately they were lost later. Now, they will be reborn in our omnipotent generation.
    Nutritionists believe that peaches are rich in nutrients. Compared with apples, they have more protein, crude fiber, ash, iron, phosphorus, potassium, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, and ascorbic acid. The fat and thiamine are similar, only the carbohydrates, calcium, and carotene are less. Medical scientists believe that peaches can promote bile secretion in the human body, promote gastrointestinal motility, and relieve constipation. Pomologists believe that peach trees can be planted everywhere, easily survive, and bear fruit quickly. As the saying goes, "Peaches in three years, apricots in four, pears in five," you can eat peaches in just three years. Plus, peaches taste good, so peach trees are worth promoting and planting on a large scale. The only regret about peaches is that, except for late-maturing honey peaches after September, most are not resistant to storage and will rot in less than a week. This problem needs to be researched and improved by fruit farmers and pomologists.

    人间肥桃胜仙桃
    越人
    据9月3日人民日报报道：“多汁而香甜的肥桃已经成熟了。山东肥城县四万五千棵大桃普告丰收……每棵结桃三百个到四百个，重的每个一斤以上。……其中二百多棵卫星大桃，每个已长到二斤重，争取在半月后长到三斤以上，……”一个桃子竟有三斤重，那不赛过一个柚子了吗？这肥桃，在各类桃中原本长的个儿比较大，曾是清代皇室的贡品，有位著名的果树学家在他的一本小册子里写道：“二十多年前，作者曾到肥城调查，在采到的标本中，有一个最大的桃子，有一斤重。1954年，作者……在济南山东农学院，看到一个最大的肥桃标本，有一斤六两重。”末后赞叹道：“这可以算是世界上硕大无比的桃子了！”这赞叹过早了！要知世上硕大无比的桃子，还看今朝。
    今年桃子不但结得多、长得大，而且质量高：色艳、香浓、味甜、汁多。闻名世界的浙江奉化玉露桃，鲜甜多汁，吃的时候不必剥皮，只消用一根麦秆插进桃皮吸吮着吃，最后只剩一张桃皮，一点不浪费，
    桃子原来生长在我国陕西、甘肃等海拔一千八百尺到六千三百尺的高原地带，是野生的，后来经过我们祖先苦心种植、经营，变成栽培桃，要算是世上最早的一种果树了。诗经周南桃夭篇有“桃之夭夭，其叶蓁蓁”等描写，专门颂桃；卫风木瓜篇有“投我以木桃，报之以琼瑶”的句子；魏风里还有“园有桃”二章。礼记上也有“桃曰胆子”的记载。可见，我国在三千年前就有桃的栽培而且相当普遍的了。现在栽培桃遍及全国各地，野生桃也还不曾绝迹。可笑的是有些资本主义国家的植物“学”者，由于他们的先辈在波斯（即今伊朗）看见许多桃树，就武断说桃原产波斯。现在叫他们长点知识：波斯的桃是我国传去的，桃原产我国，后来才渐渐向海外传播，往西传到欧洲，往东传到朝鲜、日本，传到美洲是在三百二十多年前。
    桃子的成熟期，原本只有夏、秋二季。1953年，西北农学院开始研究和试验，怎样叫桃树在冬天也能结果。现在已经育成了一种在10月份成熟的新品种，叫“西北冬桃”；还有一种在12月份成熟的新品种，也已有望。他们发出豪语：人们在一年中将有八、九个月（从6月开始到1月止）可以吃到鲜美的桃子！这是完全可能的。冬桃，我国在两千年前曾经栽培过，可惜后来失传了，如今将在无所不能的我们这一代重新得到它的生命。
    营养学家认为桃子养分很丰富，比起苹果来，它更多蛋白质、粗纤维、灰分、铁、磷、钾、核黄素、尼克酸、抗坏血酸等，脂肪和硫胺素相仿，只是碳水化合物、钙、葫萝卜素少些。医学家认为桃子能使人体胆汁分泌旺盛，能促进胃肠的蠕动，通大便。果树学家认为桃树到处可种，成活容易，结果快，俗语说“桃三杏四梨五年”，只消三年，便可吃到桃子。加上桃子味美，所以桃树值得大大推广种植。桃子的唯一遗憾，是除了9月以后晚熟的水蜜桃外，一般都不耐贮藏，过不了一星期就要腐烂。这个问题有待于果农和果树学家们研究改进了。
