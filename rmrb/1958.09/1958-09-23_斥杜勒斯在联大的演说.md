Denouncing Dulles' Speech at the United Nations
Lou Shiyi

Although Eisenhower has a tall stature and a big head, he can't turn it around and use it as a substitute for legs. Dulles was originally a rascal and a wicked lawyer, born with a big stinking mouth that distorts the facts. The Seventh Fleet sailed into China's territorial waters, yet you have the nerve to say that the Chinese people are invading your old America. You think we shouldn't recover our own territory, and trouble America to send troops from tens of thousands of miles away! A large number of naval and air forces are concentrated in the Taiwan area, clearly a malicious act of provocation. Yet you claim that you should renounce the use of force; who can be fooled by such nonsense? Peace has always existed in the Pacific Ocean, as long as your American troops retreat quickly. Jinmen and Matsu are both in China's inland sea, so you can save your breath about a ceasefire! Your warships can only be used as rocket targets, don't come to our doorstep to show off your might! You can't scare anyone with threats of war; dancing on the edge of a fire pit serves you right! In the world, you are truly a pair of buffoons, wholeheartedly endangering the peace of mankind. Don't dream such beautiful dreams in broad daylight; ten thousand feet of anger will burn you to ashes!

    斥杜勒斯在联大的演说
    楼适夷艾森豪威尔尽管长个长脑袋，可不能倒过头来代替两条腿。杜勒斯原来是无赖和恶讼师，天生一张颠倒黑白的大臭嘴。第七舰队开进了中国的领海，倒说中国人民侵略了你老美。自己的领土自己不应该收回，倒烦美国从万里外派来军队！大量海空军集中到台湾地区，明明是一种恶毒的挑衅行为。倒标榜着应该放弃使用武力，这种信口胡说还能骗得了谁？和平在太平洋上原来就存在，只要你美国的军队赶快撤退。金门和马祖都在中国的内海，停火不停火你可是尊口免开！你这些兵舰只好当火箭靶子，别开到咱家门口来耀武扬威！用战争威胁你可吓唬不倒谁，在火坑边上跳舞活该你倒霉！在世界上你们真是活宝一对，一心一意把人类的和平危害。大白天做梦可别做得这样美，万丈的怒火会把你们烧成灰！
