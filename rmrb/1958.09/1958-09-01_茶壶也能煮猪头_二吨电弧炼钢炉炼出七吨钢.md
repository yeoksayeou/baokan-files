Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 31st: Workers at the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant boldly renovated their steelmaking furnace, breaking the historical norms of small steelmaking furnaces and creating the miracle of a two-ton electric arc furnace melting seven tons of steel. This overcame the difficulty of not being able to cast large castings without a large steelmaking furnace.

This factory accepted the task this year of manufacturing four sets of 500 mm diameter rolling mills. However, they are a factory that produces medium-sized mining and mineral processing equipment, and in terms of steel casting, they only had a two-ton steelmaking furnace. The weight of the castings generally requires seven tons of molten steel. Therefore, the first difficulty facing the workers was how to melt seven tons of molten steel according to the plan's requirements. To this end, some people proposed improving the existing small furnace so that it could melt seven tons of molten steel, but some people thought that "a teapot cannot boil a pig's head" and that a small electric furnace could not melt seven tons of steel. Their basis was that "steelmaking historical data stated that the amount of steel made by small electric arc furnaces should not exceed twice the original tonnage. A two-ton furnace cannot melt more than four tons of steel." However, the majority of workers had the determination to dare to act, believing that "a teapot can boil a pig's head." They conducted a scientific analysis of the specific problems and went to fraternal factories to learn advanced experience. After two experiments, the two-ton electric arc furnace was able to refine seven tons of steel.

### 茶壶也能煮猪头  二吨电弧炼钢炉炼出七吨钢

　　茶壶也能煮猪头
　　二吨电弧炼钢炉炼出七吨钢
    据新华社沈阳31日电　沈阳矿山机器厂职工大胆改造炼钢炉，打破了小型炼钢炉的历史常规，创造出二吨电弧炼钢炉熔炼七吨钢的奇迹，克服了没有大型炼钢炉不能浇铸大型铸件的困难。
    这个厂接受了今年制造四套直径五百公厘轧钢机的任务。但是，他们是一个生产中型采矿选矿设备的工厂，在铸钢方面只有一台两吨的炼钢炉，而铸件重量一般却需七吨钢水才能铸出来。因而，摆在职工面前的第一个难关就是如何按计划要求熔炼出七吨钢水来。为此，有人提出了改进现有的小炉子，使它能够熔炼七吨钢水，但是有人认为‘茶壶不能煮猪头’，小小电炉不能熔炼七吨钢”。他们的根据是“炼钢历史资料上写着小型电弧炼钢炉炼钢量最多不得超过原吨位的一倍，二吨炉最多也不能熔炼四吨钢。但是大多数的职工，有敢干的决心，认为“茶壶能够煮猪头”，他们对具体问题进行了科学的分析，并到兄弟工厂学习先进经验。经过两次试验，便使二吨电弧炼钢炉炼出了七吨钢。
