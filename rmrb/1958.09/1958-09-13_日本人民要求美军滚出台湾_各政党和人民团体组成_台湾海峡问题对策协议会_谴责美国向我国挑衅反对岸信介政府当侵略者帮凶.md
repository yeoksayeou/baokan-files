Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: A "Taiwan Strait Issue Countermeasures Council" jointly formed by more than a dozen Japanese peace and friendship organizations and the Japanese Communist Party was declared established in Tokyo today. The council condemned the United States for creating tension in the Far East and demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government not be an accomplice to the United States' military provocations.

This council, composed of people's organizations and political parties such as the Japan China Friendship Association, the National Council for the Restoration of Japan China Diplomatic Relations, the Japan Peace Committee, the Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the Executive Committee for the Memorial Service for Chinese Martyrs, the Okinawa Prefectural Association, some labor unions, and the Japanese Communist Party, issued an appeal to the Japanese people today, pointing out that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, as well as the mainland's coastal islands, are Chinese territory, and the Chinese people are determined to liberate these islands. However, the U.S. government is aiding the Chiang Kai-shek group that has been spurned by the Chinese people. Echoing its armed intervention in the Middle East, the United States is now intensifying its military provocations against China.

The appeal revealed that U.S. troops formerly stationed at U.S. bases in Japan, such as Okinawa, Iwakuni, and Atsugi, have successively moved to the Taiwan Strait area, and naval bases such as Yokosuka have become important strongholds of the U.S. Seventh Fleet.

The appeal pointed out that if the Japanese people continue to allow the U.S. military to use bases within Japan, Japan may be immediately drawn into a full-scale war and suffer retaliatory strikes when the U.S. military directly engages in war. The flames of war in the Taiwan Strait could engulf Japan and other Asian countries, turning into a terrible atomic war.

The appeal then criticized the Kishi Nobusuke government for betraying the wishes of the peace-loving Japanese people and preparing to assist the U.S. military's actions. The appeal pointed out that the Japanese people have not forgotten the suffering of past wars and are deeply reflecting on the wars that have occurred. They are determined never to take up arms against the Chinese people, and they are united in their opposition to war.

The appeal called on all Japanese people to take immediate action to defend peace in the Far East and launch a struggle demanding that the United States stop interfering in China's internal affairs and withdraw U.S. troops from Taiwan. At the same time, it demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government must not allow Japan to be dragged into war, refuse the U.S. military to use its bases in Japan to carry out armed provocations in the Taiwan Strait, stop creating the "two Chinas" conspiracy, and sever all relations with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group.

    日本人民要求美军滚出台湾
    各政党和人民团体组成“台湾海峡问题对策协议会”
    谴责美国向我国挑衅反对岸信介政府当侵略者帮凶
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：由十几个日本和平友好团体和日本共产党联合组成的“台湾海峡问题对策协议会”今天在东京宣告成立。协议会谴责美国在远东制造紧张局势，同时要求岸信介政府不要作为美国进行军事挑衅的帮凶。
  这个由日中友好协会、恢复日中邦交国民会议、日本和平委员会、反对原子弹和氢弹协议会、中国殉难烈士慰灵实行委员会、冲绳县人会和一些工会以及日本共产党等人民团体和政党组成的协议会，今天发表一项致日本人民的呼吁书指出，台湾和澎湖列岛以及大陆沿海岛屿都是中国的领土，中国人民已经下决心一定要解放这些岛屿。但是，美国政府竟援助已被中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团。和它在中东进行的武装干涉相呼应，美国现在又加剧对中国进行军事挑衅。
    呼吁书揭露，原驻在冲绳、岩国、厚木等日本基地的美军陆续开往台湾海峡地区，横须贺等海军基地都变成美国第七舰队的重要据点。
    呼吁书指出，如果日本人民继续听任美军使用日本境内的基地，那么在美军直接进行战争的时候，日本有可能立即被卷入全面战争，并且受到报复性的打击。在台湾海峡烧起来的战火，将有可能把日本和亚洲各国卷进去，变成可怕的原子战争。
    呼吁书接着指责了岸信介政府背叛热爱和平的日本人民的愿望，正在准备协助美军的军事行动。呼吁书指出，日本人民还没有忘掉过去的战争痛苦，并且对过去发生的战争正进行着深刻的反省。他们已经下定决心绝不对中国人民拿起枪杆，他们要全体反对战争。
    呼吁书号召全体日本人民为保卫远东的和平立即行动起来展开斗争，要求美国停止干涉中国内政，从台湾撤出美国军队。同时，要求岸信介政府绝不能使日本卷入战争，拒绝美军使用它设在日本的基地来进行台湾海峡的武装挑衅，停止制造“两个中国”的阴谋，断绝同台湾蒋介石集团的一切关系。
