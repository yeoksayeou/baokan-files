Responsible Person of All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese Issues Statement
    Resolutely Fight the Aggressors to the End

    (Our dispatch) The responsible person of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese told reporters on the 7th that all returned overseas Chinese resolutely support Premier Zhou's statement on September 6 regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait. The responsible person said that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are Chinese territory and absolutely cannot be allowed to continue to be occupied by U.S. imperialism. Liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair and brooks no foreign interference.
    The responsible person also said that U.S. imperialism has recently been deploying troops to the Taiwan Strait, creating a tense situation in an attempt to intimidate the Chinese people and prevent them from liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands. We seriously warn the U.S. imperialist aggressors: Your provocations cannot scare the Chinese people. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and we are determined to liberate Taiwan. We love peace, but we are definitely not afraid of war. All returned overseas Chinese will join the people of the whole country in resolutely participating in the just struggle to liberate Taiwan and resolutely fight the American aggressors to the end.
    The responsible person also said: If U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war and interfere in our country's liberation of Taiwan, we will not only drive the U.S. imperialist aggressors out of the Taiwan Strait, but also completely eliminate U.S. imperialism.
