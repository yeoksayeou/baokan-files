Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Premier Zhou Enlai held a grand banquet tonight to celebrate the ninth anniversary of National Day, hosting experts and their wives from brotherly countries and brotherly parties. In his speech at the banquet, Premier Zhou emphasized: "The Chinese people adhere to the position of safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity, adhere to the position of defending peace, and do not give up efforts to resolve disputes between China and the United States through peaceful negotiations. However, if US imperialism insists on provoking a war for the invasion of Jinmen and Mazu, then the united 600 million Chinese people, with the sympathy and support of the entire socialist camp and all peace-loving countries and people, will surely make the US imperialist aggression ultimately suffer a complete defeat."

Premier Zhou said: "Recently, US imperialism has carried out military provocations and war threats against our country in the Taiwan Strait region, attempting to expand its aggression against China from Taiwan and Penghu to the inland sea islands of Jinmen and Mazu. Such actions by US imperialism, which interfere in our internal affairs, infringe upon our sovereignty, and threaten peace in the Far East and the world, are intolerable to the Chinese people and also intolerable to all peace-loving countries and people in the world. The deep sympathy and strong support shown by the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union for the just struggle of the Chinese people has greatly encouraged the Chinese people, and we express our heartfelt gratitude."

Premier Zhou's words were not finished, and a storm of applause resounded in the three halls where the banquet was being held simultaneously, demonstrating the unbreakable, rock-solid unity of the socialist countries in the common struggle. Relying on such unity, any conspiracy of the imperialists will be completely shattered.

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai also introduced to the guests the situation of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction, and sincerely thanked the experts from brotherly countries and brotherly parties for their sincere assistance to China's construction. Premier Zhou said: "1958 is the first year of China's Second Five-Year Plan. In this year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and after the nationwide rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, the Chinese people have greatly raised their socialist consciousness and achieved great achievements in various construction undertakings. The general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results has mobilized all positive factors in the country. Because we have implemented the Party Central Committee's policy of running industry, agriculture, and cultural and educational undertakings by the whole Party and the whole people in our practical work, a Great Leap Forward situation has emerged in various parts of our country."

"We often say: a large population gives us strength. As long as we mobilize the 600 million people, break superstitions, liberate our minds, break outdated rules and regulations, and promote the spirit of innovation, there is nothing that cannot be done. The Party's mass line is the fundamental source of all our achievements. This year, the total output of grain crops in our country is expected to reach more than 700 billion catties, with an average of about 1,000 catties of grain per person, which will fundamentally improve the grain supply situation in our country. The Great Leap Forward in agriculture has promoted the rapid development of industry. Now, the whole country is striving to complete the production task of 10.7 million tons of steel, based on the principle of large, medium, and small enterprises coexisting, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. We are not only fully confident of catching up with the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years, but we can also achieve it ahead of schedule."

"Our technological revolution and cultural revolution have also achieved great achievements this year. The movement of people's communes has already formed a climax throughout the country, first in the vast rural areas, which will greatly accelerate the process of socialist construction in our country and provide favorable conditions for the transition to a communist society. We have adhered to the policy of combining education with productive labor, and adhered to the system of cadres participating in physical labor. Since this spring, major leading cadres have spent about four months inspecting work in grassroots units such as factories and rural areas, understanding the situation, promoting the development of various construction undertakings, and strengthening the connection between leaders and the masses. We will adhere to this system in the future."

Premier Zhou emphasized: "The achievements that the Chinese people have made in the cause of socialist construction are inseparable from the sincere assistance given by the brotherly countries and brotherly parties, as well as the outstanding experts they have sent. The governments and people of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries have done everything possible to rush-produce equipment for our country, which has played an important role in putting many of our industrial and mining enterprises into production ahead of schedule. In order to help the Chinese people achieve a comprehensive leap forward in various construction undertakings, the expert comrades have worked selflessly, contributing their rich knowledge and advanced experience without reservation. I now, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, express my deep gratitude to the governments and people of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, to the brotherly parties, and to all expert comrades."

Premier Zhou said: "The tasks facing the Chinese people are great and arduous. However, we firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the support of the brotherly countries and brotherly parties, and with the enthusiastic help of the expert comrades, the Chinese people will surely overcome numerous difficulties and achieve even greater victories."

When Premier Zhou Enlai spoke about the tremendous achievements of China's socialist construction and the deep gratitude to the experts, the applause in the hall continued incessantly. At this time, Vice Premiers Peng Dehuai, Deng Zihui, He Long, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Marshal Ye Jianying, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Wu Yuzhang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, and all the heads of government departments attending the banquet stood up to warmly toast all the experts and their wives and the ambassadors of brotherly countries, expressing their cordial greetings and wishing the eternal friendship between China and all brotherly countries would last forever.

Tonight's banquet began at 7 o'clock. More than 2,400 Chinese and foreign guests warmly gathered in the three spacious banquet halls of the Beijing Hotel. This was a grand banquet showing the unprecedented unity of the socialist family. At this banquet, Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to China Antonov and Soviet economic expert leader Fumin delivered speeches full of deep friendship, warmly congratulating China's ninth National Day and the Great Leap Forward in the cause of socialist construction.

In his speech, Antonov warmly congratulated the victorious development of the socialist construction of the Chinese people. He said excitedly: "Here we are just like at home." He said: "The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the further development of the People's Republic of China not only make us Soviet people happy, but also make the people of all countries in the socialist camp especially happy. The people of these countries regard the Chinese people as their loyal and reliable friends."

Antonov emphasized: "The imperialists and their lackeys clearly know how huge a force of fear the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, the friendship between the people of all countries in the socialist camp, is for them. Therefore, they are frantically trying to undermine this friendship and hinder its further development." Antonov affirmed: "But their efforts are in vain, our friendship is unshakable."

Fumin expressed in his speech the Soviet people's concern and sincere friendship for the Chinese people's construction cause. He said: "The Soviet people pay close attention to everything that happens in People's China, and sincerely hope that you—our friends, our brothers—will achieve the greatest achievements in the great cause of building a new society."

Fumin continued: "The experience of several years has proved that all attempts by the US imperialist group to undermine the economy of the socialist camp countries, especially the economy of the young People's Republic of China, through blockade and embargo, have failed." He said: "Imperialism is extremely afraid of the ever-developing socialism and the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and South America, and attempts to turn back the wheel of historical development and put the shackles of enslavement back on the people who have already been liberated. However, no matter how the American aggressors play tricks, no matter how the heads of monopoly capital carry out robber-style planning and cobble together robber-style alliances, the cause of socialist peace is invincible."

Fumin also said with full confidence: "Our two countries have established the closest brotherly relations in all aspects. The people of our two countries help each other, thus making the powerful peace and socialist camp more consolidated and more indestructible."

The enthusiastic words of the two Soviet friends from the great ally aroused the resonance of friendship in people's hearts. The applause in the hall continued, and more than 2,000 people repeatedly toasted to the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

At the grand banquet, the representatives of the socialist countries also frequently raised their glasses to wish the leaders of the parties and governments of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries good health, and to wish the victory of the common great cause of communism. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi walked to the various halls to toast all the expert comrades who were helping our country carry out socialist construction and their wives, expressing their condolences for their hard work and their gratitude for their enthusiastic help.

After the grand banquet ended, a grand dance and brilliant artistic performances began. On this joyful night, people with common ideas, common struggles, and common causes were completely immersed in the lofty internationalist friendship from beginning to end.

    周总理举行盛大国庆宴会
    感谢各兄弟国家专家热情帮助我国建设
    他说：如果美帝国主义硬要为侵略金门、马祖而挑起战争，那么，团结一致的六亿人民，在整个社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持下，必将使美帝国主义的侵略行动最后遭到彻底失败。
    新华社28日讯  周恩来总理今晚为庆祝国庆九周年举行盛大宴会，招待各兄弟国家和兄弟党的专家和他们的夫人。周总理在宴会上的讲话中强调指出：“中国人民坚持维护主权和领土完整的立场，坚持保卫和平的立场，也不放弃通过和平谈判解决中美两国争端的努力。但是，如果美帝国主义硬要为侵略金门、马祖而挑起战争，那么，团结一致的六亿中国人民，在整个社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持下，必将使美帝国主义的侵略行动最后遭到彻底的失败。”
    周总理说：“最近，美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区向我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，企图把它对中国的侵略从台湾、澎湖扩大到中国的内海岛屿金门、马祖。美帝国主义这种干涉我国内政、侵犯我国主权、威胁远东和世界和平的行为，是中国人民决不能容忍的，也是全世界爱好和平的国家和人民所决不能容忍的。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国，对于我国人民的正义斗争所表示的深切同情和有力支持，给中国人民极大的鼓舞，我们表示衷心的感激。”
    周总理的话音未了，在同时举行宴会的三个大厅里就响起了暴风雨般的掌声，显示了在共同的斗争中社会主义各国人民牢不可破的坚如磐石般的团结。依靠这样的团结，帝国主义者的任何阴谋都将被彻底粉碎。
    周恩来总理在讲话中，并向客人们介绍了中国社会主义建设全面大跃进的情况，衷心感谢各兄弟国家和兄弟党的专家们对我国建设的真诚援助。周总理说：“1958年是我国第二个五年计划的头一年。在这一年里，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，经过全民整风运动和反右派斗争，全中国人民大大地提高了社会主义觉悟，在各项建设事业中获得了巨大的成就。鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，调动了全国的一切积极因素。由于我们在实际工作中贯彻了党中央关于在全党全民办工业、办农业、办文教事业的方针，在我国各地出现了大跃进的局面。”
    “我们常说：人多势众。只要把六亿人民动员起来，破除迷信，解放思想，打破陈旧规章，提倡首创精神，就没有办不到的事情。党的群众路线是我国一切成就的根本泉源。今年我国粮食作物的总产量预计可能达到七千亿斤以上，平均每人将有粮食一千斤左右，这将使我国的粮食供应状况得到根本的改善。农业的大跃进促进了工业的迅速发展。现在全国正本着大、中、小并举，土洋结合的方针，为完成一千零七十万吨钢的生产任务而奋斗。十五年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国，不仅有充分的把握，而且可以提前做到。”
    “我国的技术革命和文化革命，在这一年里也获得了巨大的成就。人民公社化的运动，已经在全国首先在广大农村中形成了高潮，这将大大加快我国社会主义建设的进程，并且为过渡到共产主义社会提供便利的条件。我们坚持了教育与生产劳动结合的方针，坚持了干部参加体力劳动的制度。从今年春天起，主要领导干部都抽出四个月左右的时间到工厂、农村等基层单位视察工作，了解情况，推动各项建设事业的发展，加强了领导同群众的联系。今后我们将坚持这种制度。”
    周总理强调指出：“我国人民在社会主义建设事业中所取得的成就，是同各兄弟国家和各兄弟党以及他们派来的优秀的专家所给予的真诚援助分不开的。苏联和各兄弟国家的政府和人民，千方百计地为我国赶制设备，这对于我国不少工矿企业提前投入生产，起了重要的作用。专家同志们为了帮助中国人民的各项建设事业获得全面的跃进，忘我地进行着劳动，毫无保留地贡献出他们的丰富知识和先进经验。我现在代表中国政府和中国人民向苏联和其他兄弟国家的政府和人民，向各兄弟党，向全体专家同志们表示深深的谢意。”
    周总理说：“中国人民面前的任务是伟大而艰巨的。但是，我们完全相信，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，同时，有着各兄弟国家和各兄弟党的支援，有着专家同志们的热诚帮助，一定能够克服重重困难，取得更伟大的胜利。”
    周恩来总理谈到中国社会主义建设的巨大成就和对专家们的深厚谢意时，全场掌声不息，这时，彭德怀、邓子恢、贺龙、陈毅、聂荣臻、薄一波副总理，国防委员会副主席叶剑英元帅，中苏友好协会总会吴玉章副会长，外交部张闻天副部长和所有出席宴会的政府各部门的负责人，都站立起来同全体专家和他们的夫人以及各兄弟国家驻华使节热烈碰杯，向他们亲切致意，祝贺中国同各个兄弟国家之间的永恒友谊万古长存。
    今晚的宴会在七时开始。两千四百多位中外客人在北京饭店三个宽敞的宴会大厅里热情欢聚。这是显示出社会主义大家庭空前团结的一次盛宴。在这个宴会上，苏联驻中国临时代办安东诺夫和苏联经济专家负责人符明，先后发表了充满深情厚谊的讲话，热烈祝贺我国国庆九周年和社会主义建设事业一日千里的大跃进。
    安东诺夫在讲话中，热烈祝贺我国人民社会主义建设事业的胜利发展，他激动地说：“在这里我们就像在自己的家里一样。”他说：“中国人民革命的胜利，和中华人民共和国的进一步发展，不仅使我们苏联人高兴，而且也使社会主义阵营所有各国人民特别高兴，这些国家的人民都把中国人民看作是自己的忠实可靠的朋友。”
    安东诺夫强调说：“帝国主义者和他们的走狗清楚地知道，中苏友谊，社会主义阵营各国人民的友谊，对他们来说是多么巨大的恐惧力量，因此他们疯狂地企图破坏这个友谊，并且妨碍它的进一步发展。”安东诺夫肯定地说：“但是他们是枉费心机的，我们的友谊是不可动摇的。”
    符明在讲话中表达了苏联人民对中国人民的建设事业的关怀和诚挚的友谊。他说：“苏联人民十分注意在人民中国所发生的一切，并且衷心地希望你们——我们的朋友、我们的兄弟，在建设新社会的伟大事业中获得最大的成就”。
    符明继续说：“几年来的经验证明，美帝国主义集团企图用封锁和禁运来破坏社会主义阵营各国的经济，首先是年青的中华人民共和国的经济的一切尝试，都遭到了失败。”他说：“帝国主义对日益发展的社会主义和亚洲、非洲、南美各国的民族解放运动感到极大的恐惧，企图倒转历史发展的车轮，把奴役的枷锁重新套在已经解放了的人民的头上。但是，不管美国侵略者怎样玩弄阴谋诡计，不管垄断资本的头子们怎样进行强盗式的策划和拼凑强盗式的联盟，社会主义和平事业都是不可战胜的。”
    符明还满怀信心地说：“我们两国在各个方面都建立了最亲密的兄弟关系。我们两国人民互相帮助，从而使强大的和平和社会主义阵营更加巩固，更加坚不可摧。”
    来自伟大盟邦的两位苏联友人的热情话语，在人们的心里激起了友谊的共鸣，全场掌声持续不断，两千多人一再地为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结而干杯。
    在盛大的宴会上，社会主义各国的代表们，还频频举杯祝苏联和各社会主义国家的党和政府的领导同志的健康，祝共同的伟大的共产主义事业的胜利。周恩来总理、陈毅副总理兼外交部长走到各个大厅，向帮助我国进行社会主义建设的全体专家同志和他们的夫人们敬酒，对他们辛勤的劳动表示慰问，对他们热情的帮助表示感谢。
    盛大的宴会结束以后，盛大的舞会和精采的艺术表演接着开始。在这个欢乐的夜晚，有着共同的思想、共同斗争和共同事业的人们，自始至终完全沉浸在崇高的国际主义友情之中。
