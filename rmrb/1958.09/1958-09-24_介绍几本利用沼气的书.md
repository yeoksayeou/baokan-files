    Introducing Several Books on Biogas Utilization
    Recently, we have received many letters from readers requesting the introduction of books and periodicals on biogas utilization for study and research.
    As far as we know, the books on biogas utilization published in Beijing include: "Biogas" (compiled by the National Agricultural Tools Exhibition), published by the Agricultural Publishing House; "How to Use Biogas for Power Generation" (written by Zhu Ke and Zhou Wenhai), published by the Water Resources and Electric Power Publishing House; "Rural Biogas Fermentation Tank," published by the Science Popularization Publishing House. In terms of periodicals, the fourth issue of the "Agricultural Machinery" semi-monthly, the tenth issue of "Science Popularization Work," and the August issue of "Science Popularization" also published articles on biogas utilization. These books and articles are written in plain and easy-to-understand language and can be used as a reference for readers.

    介绍几本利用沼气的书
    最近我们接到不少读者来信，要求介绍一些关于利用沼气的书籍和刊物，以便进行学习和研究。
    据我们所知，目前关于利用沼气的书籍，在北京出版的有：“沼气”（全国农具展览会编），农业出版社出版；“怎样利用沼气发电”（朱可、周文海著），水利电力出版社出版；“农村沼气发酵池”，科学普及出版社出版。在刊物方面，“农业机械”半月刊第四期，“科学普及工作”第十期和“科学大众”8月号上，也刊登一些有关利用沼气的文章。这些书籍和文章都写得通俗易懂，可供读者参考。
