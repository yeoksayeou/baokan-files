Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: The Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League passed a resolution on organizing the broad masses of young people to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works. This resolution calls on young people nationwide to launch a movement to study Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong's works.

    The resolution states: Marxism-Leninism is the science of the laws of social development, the science of the proletarian revolution, and the science of socialist and communist construction. The great victories continuously achieved in the liberation struggles of the working people around the world have proven and will continue to prove that Marxism-Leninism is an invincible scientific truth.

    Comrade Mao Zedong is an outstanding contemporary Marxist. His works profoundly summarize the rich experience of the Chinese revolutionary movement, creatively develop Marxism-Leninism, and are a model of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. The revolutionary history of our country over the past few decades proves that when Mao Zedong's thought is used to guide revolutionary struggle, the revolution achieves one brilliant victory after another; when Mao Zedong's thought is used to guide socialist construction, construction changes our country's backward "poor and blank" state in thousands of years at the fastest speed. Mao Zedong's works are the lighthouse leading the Chinese people to victory and advancement, and the guide for the Chinese people to build socialism and communism. Our movement to study Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong's works requires us to adhere to the principle of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of our country's revolution and construction in our work and study. It requires the youth of our country to grasp this great ideological weapon for accelerating the victory of the socialist revolution. Only in this way can young people be liberated from the shackles of all old traditional ideas, never lose their way, always be full of vigor, be full of drive, and become conscious communist fighters. The resolution points out that in order to study theory well, one must also have correct learning attitudes and methods. The resolution says, we must follow Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings: "We should establish the policy of focusing on studying the practical problems of the Chinese revolution and using the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism as a guide, and abolish the method of studying Marxism-Leninism statically and in isolation." We should fully understand the spirit and essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, grasp its stand, viewpoints, and methods, and connect it with our thoughts and actual situation, in order to achieve the goal of transforming our thinking and improving our work.

    The resolution concludes: In order to help the broad masses of young people study, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has decided to publish selected works of Marxist-Leninist classics and Mao Zedong's works suitable for young people to read. The Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League calls on members of the Communist Youth League and young people to consciously participate in the study movement of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works. We should widely organize study groups of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works among young people, and launch a learning upsurge of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works with the participation of millions of young people, hold high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism, and strive to promote the socialist construction of our country at the highest speed.

    共青团三中全会号召全国青年
    学习理论学习毛泽东著作成为自觉的共产主义战士
    新华社13日讯　在共青团中央召开的三届三中全会上，通过了关于组织广大青年学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作的决议。这个决议号召全国青年开展一个学习马克思列宁主义理论、学习毛泽东著作的运动。
    决议中说：马克思列宁主义，是关于社会的发展规律的科学，是关于无产阶级进行革命斗争的科学，是关于社会主义、共产主义建设的科学。全世界劳动人民解放斗争所不断取得的伟大胜利，已经证明并且将继续证明马克思列宁主义是战无不胜的科学真理。
    毛泽东同志是当代杰出的马克思主义者，他的著作深刻地总结了中国革命运动的丰富经验，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的典范。我国几十年的革命历史证明，用毛泽东同志的思想来指导革命斗争，革命就一个接着一个地取得辉煌的胜利；用毛泽东同志的思想来指导社会主义建设，建设就以最快的速度，改变着我国几千年来“一穷二白”的落后面貌；毛泽东著作是领导中国人民胜利前进的灯塔，是中国人民建设社会主义、共产主义的指南。我们开展学习马克思列宁主义理论、学习毛泽东著作的运动，就是要求我们在工作和学习中坚持着马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同我国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的原则；就是要求我国青年一定要掌握这个加速社会主义革命胜利的伟大的思想武器。只有这样，才能使青年从一切旧的传统思想的束缚下解放出来，永远不迷失方向，永远朝气蓬勃，干劲十足，成为自觉的共产主义战士。决议指出，要学好理论还必须有正确的学习态度和学习方法。决议说，我们必须遵循毛泽东同志的教导：“应确立以研究中国革命实际问题为中心，以马克思列宁主义基本原则为指导的方针，废除静止地孤立地研究马克思列宁主义的方法”。应该充分领会马克思列宁主义、毛泽东著作的精神实质，掌握它的立场、观点和方法，联系思想，联系实际，以达到改造思想、改进工作的目的。
    决议最后说：为了帮助广大青年学习，共青团中央决定出版适合青年阅读的马克思列宁主义经典著作和毛泽东著作的选本。共青团三届三中全会号召共青团员和青年们，自觉地参加马克思列宁主义、毛泽东著作的学习运动。在青年中广泛地组织马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作的学习小组，掀起一个由千百万青年参加的学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作的热潮，高举马克思列宁主义的红旗，用最高速度推进我国社会主义建设事业而斗争。
