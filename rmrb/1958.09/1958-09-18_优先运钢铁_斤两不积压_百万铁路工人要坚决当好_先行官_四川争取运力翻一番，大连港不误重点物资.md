Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: Millions of railway workers across the country are urgently mobilizing to resolutely act as "pioneers," ensuring the completion of the current national urgent transportation tasks related to steel production.

Entering September, with the large-scale battle on the steel front unfolding, railway transportation tasks are becoming increasingly heavy. Although the railway departments and railway workers across the country have made tremendous efforts, the transportation work in the first half of September has improved compared to August; however, the actual completed transportation volume still falls far short of national requirements. In September, about a quarter of the materials that various departments across the country requested for railway transportation were not included in the railway transportation plan. Of the materials included in the plan, more than 10,000 train cars of ore, more than 4,000 train cars of coke, and more than 80,000 train cars of coal were not transported in early September.

In order to reverse this serious tense situation in railway transportation, the Ministry of Railways has decided to take revolutionary measures to explore the potential of existing railway transportation in every possible way. From now on, more than 4,000 more train cars of goods must be loaded every day than in the first half of the month, and even more will be added after October.

To accomplish this arduous task, the turnover of locomotives and vehicles must be accelerated. The key problem currently affecting the turnover of locomotives and vehicles is that the unloading work has not been done well. Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and other six iron and steel enterprises have recently experienced a surge in arriving materials. Due to insufficient handling capacity and inadequate preparation of freight yards, nearly a thousand freight cars are backlogged every day. Now, under the leadership of the local Party committees, stations across the country are relying on the strength of the entire Party and all the people, using the method of ants moving mountains, to rush to unload and transport. They are required to move all the backlogged goods at the stations within three days, opening the way for smooth transportation.

To complete the current railway transportation tasks, it is also necessary to greatly strengthen the organization of railway transportation and the internal and external cooperation of the railway. In this regard, the Jinzhou Railway Administration has created relatively comprehensive experience. The Ministry of Railways believes that the experience of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau is a red flag in transportation work and requires railway bureaus across the country to learn from the experience of the Jinzhou Bureau to rapidly change the face of railway transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, September 17th: The entire Party and all the people of Sichuan Province are mobilized to realize "doubling transportation capacity" and rush to transport steel materials. Employees of the province's transportation departments put forward slogans: Prioritize steel transport, not an ounce of backlog, provide as much transport capacity as needed, and transport whenever needed. In the first week of September, they have already rushed to transport more than 52,000 tons of steel, ore, coking coal, bricks, and tiles, etc., from Sichuan Province's twenty major steel production areas where more than 56,000 tons were backlogged, basically meeting the needs of steel production in these areas.

Currently, a unified transportation coordination headquarters has been established throughout the province, and many special districts and counties have also established transportation headquarters to prioritize and balance materials, organize rational transportation, comprehensively utilize various tools, and grasp major surprise scheduling.

Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian, September 17th: Dalian Port is implementing the method of handling raw materials for steel production and metallurgical equipment on arrival, promptly transporting more than a dozen large cranes and tens of thousands of tons of magnesite, coking coal, coke, soda ash, etc., powerfully supporting the rapidly developing steel industry in Shanghai, Tianjin, Ma'anshan, Chongqing and other places.

Dalian Port is constantly trying to find ways to enable ships to load more and run faster. Recently, fifteen voyages in this port have implemented the method of combining light and heavy cargo loading, carrying a total of 15,000 tons of additional cargo, equivalent to adding five ships with a deadweight of 3,000 tons to participate in the transportation.

### 优先运钢铁　斤两不积压  百万铁路工人要坚决当好“先行官”  四川争取运力翻一番，大连港不误重点物资

    优先运钢铁　斤两不积压
    百万铁路工人要坚决当好“先行官”
    四川争取运力翻一番，大连港不误重点物资
    据新华社17日讯　全国上百万铁路职工正在紧急动员起来，坚决当好“先行官”，保证完成当前国家紧迫的钢铁生产方面的运输任务。
    进入9月份，随着钢铁战线上大规模战斗的展开，铁路运输任务愈来愈繁重。虽然铁路部门和全国铁路职工做了巨大努力，9月上半月的运输工作比8月份有了好转；但实际完成的运输量同国家的要求仍然相差很远。9月份全国各部门要求铁路运输的物资，大约有四分之一没有列入铁路运输计划，列入计划的物资在9月上旬也有一万多车矿石、四千多车焦炭和八万多车煤炭没有运走。
    为了扭转铁路运输这种严重的紧张局面，铁道部决定采取革命措施，千方百计挖掘现有铁路运输潜力。从现在起，每天要比上半月多装四千多车货物，10月份以后还要增加。
    要完成这个艰巨的任务，必须加快机车车辆的周转。目前影响机车车辆周转的关键问题是卸车工作没有做好。鞍钢、武钢等六个钢铁企业，最近因为到达的物资激增，搬运能力和货场准备不足，每天都有近千辆货车积压。现在全国各地车站正在当地党委的领导下，依靠全党全民的力量，用蚂蚁搬泰山的办法，抢卸抢运，要求在三天内，把车站积压的货物全部搬运干净，为运输的畅通打开道路。
    要完成当前的铁路运输任务，还必须大大加强铁路运输的组织工作和铁路内部、外部的协作。在这方面锦州铁路管理局创造了比较全面的经验。铁道部认为锦州铁路局的经验是运输工作中的一面红旗，要求全国各地铁路局要学习锦州局的经验，使铁路运输面貌迅速改观。
    据新华社成都17日电　四川省全党全民动员，实现“运力加番”，抢运钢铁物资。全省交通运输部门职工提出口号：优先运钢铁，斤两不积压，要多少运力，给多少运力，什么时候要，什么时候运。9月份的第一周内，他们已把四川省二十个主要钢铁产地积压的五万六千多吨钢铁、矿石、焦煤、砖瓦等物资，抢运出五万二千多吨，基本上满足了这些地区钢铁生产的需要。
    目前，全省一个统一的运输协作指挥部已经成立，许多专区和县也成立了运输指挥部，进行物资排队平衡，组织合理运输，综合利用各种工具，掌握大的突击调度等工作。
    据新华社旅大17日电　大连港实行钢铁生产原材料和冶金设备随到随行的办法，及时地运出十几台大型吊车和成千上万吨镁砂、炼焦煤、焦炭、纯碱等，有力地支援了上海、天津、马鞍山、重庆等地飞跃发展的钢铁工业。
    大连港不断想办法使船舶能多装快跑。最近以来，这个港口有十五个航次实行轻重搭配装货办法，共多拉了一万五千吨货物，等于增加了五艘载重量三千吨的船参加了运输。
