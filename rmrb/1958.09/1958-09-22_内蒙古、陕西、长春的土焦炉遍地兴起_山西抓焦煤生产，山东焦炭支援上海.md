To give full play to the iron and steel industry, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Changchun all have a large number of local coke ovens springing up.
Shanxi is concentrating on coking coal production, and Shandong coke is supporting Shanghai.
(Our newspaper, Hohhot, 21st dispatch) The people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are vigorously building coke ovens to support the development of the iron and steel industry. As of early September, 1,096 new indigenous coking ovens have been built throughout the region, of which 188 have produced more than 30,000 tons of coke. Various places are continuing to build coke ovens, striving to complete the production task of 600,000 tons of coke before the end of the year.

In the mass coking campaign, in the city of Manzhouli on the Sino-Soviet border, from coal mines, banks, postal and telecommunications bureaus, to schools and neighborhood committees, everyone was mobilized to establish 123 indigenous coke ovens in a short period, using the local Datou coal to produce coke. Many factories, mines, agricultural cooperatives, construction companies, and commercial departments in Hohhot, Baotou, Zhaowuda League, Hulunbuir League, and other places have also set up small and medium-sized coking plants to speed up coke production.

(Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an dispatch) Many areas in Shaanxi Province are vigorously carrying out coke production to meet the needs of the iron and steel industry.

As of the 17th, more than 270 indigenous coke ovens have been built throughout the province, producing a total of more than 10,000 tons of coke. The Tongchuan Mining Area in the Weibei Coalfield, which has the largest coking task, has now built 57 indigenous coke ovens, producing more than 880 tons of coke. The coal construction companies of 19 counties and cities are also actively using stockpiled coking coal for indigenous coking. The coal construction companies of Xi'an and Baoji have supplied the coke produced to various production units for use.

According to the needs of the province's iron and steel industry production this year and the distribution of resources, the Shaanxi Provincial Coal Industry Bureau has decided to build more than 1,500 indigenous coke ovens in a short period in areas where coking conditions are available.

(Our newspaper, Changchun, 21st dispatch) In order to ensure the needs of the iron and steel industry, Changchun City is organizing mass coking among all factories, schools, government agencies, and residents. As of the 15th, more than 410 large kilns have been built throughout the city, with more than 100 put into production; more than 930 coking kilns are under construction and planning. It is estimated that more than 135,300 tons of coke can be produced by the end of the year, which will exceed the original plan by more than 5,000 tons. In mass coking, all units mostly adopt the method of "mainly indigenous, combining indigenous and foreign," so the investment is small and the progress is fast.

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 21st dispatch) Shanxi Province, one of the main producing areas of coking coal in the country, has recently taken measures to increase coking coal production to support the needs of the iron and steel industry throughout the country.

Shanxi Province supplies coking coal to more than 3,000 industrial and mining enterprises in more than 20 provinces and cities across the country. From January to August this year, a total of more than 1.8 million tons of coking coal has been transferred to these areas. However, with the rapid development of the national iron and steel industry, it is estimated that the coking coal to be supplied in the four months from September to December will exceed 2 million tons. At present, various coal mine production units in Shanxi have set off a competition upsurge of producing a thousand tons a day and digging wells for thousands of miles, and the workers are working hard day and night to increase the production of more coking coal. It is estimated that by tapping the potential of existing production mines alone, more than 200,000 tons of coking coal can be produced for export.

The Shanxi Provincial Coal Management Department recently made overall arrangements for coking coal supply work, first ensuring the needs of the iron and steel industry inside and outside the province for coking coal. After tapping the potential for increased production and making overall arrangements in this way, the coking coal exported by Shanxi Province in the next four months will exceed about 70% of the total amount supplied outside the province from January to August.

(Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th dispatch) Shandong Province, in the case of a very tight supply of coke and scrap steel, carried forward the spirit of communist cooperation and decided to immediately allocate 18,000 tons of coke to support the Shanghai iron and steel industry. This is another support action after the province transferred 23,000 tons of scrap steel to Shanghai last month. The first batch of 10,000 tons of coke will be loaded and shipped within days, and the remaining 8,000 tons of coke and 12,000 tons of scrap steel will also be accelerated for allocation and shipment.

    全民炼焦给钢铁工业加足马力
    内蒙古、陕西、长春的土焦炉遍地兴起
    山西抓焦煤生产，山东焦炭支援上海
    本报呼和浩特21日电　内蒙古自治区各族人民正在大建炼焦炉，支援发展钢铁工业。到9月上旬，全区新建的土法炼焦炉已达一千零九十六座，其中一百八十八座已生产出焦炭三万多吨。各地还在继续兴建炼焦炉，争取在年底以前完成六十万吨焦炭的生产任务。
    全民性的炼焦运动中，在中苏边境的满洲里市，从煤矿、银行、邮电局职工乃至学校、居民委员会，都一齐动员起来，短期内就建立了一百二十三座土焦炉，用当地出产的大头煤炼出了焦炭。呼和浩特、包头、昭乌达盟、呼伦贝尔盟等地许多厂矿、农业社、建筑工程公司和商业部门，也纷纷办起中小型炼焦场，加紧生产焦炭。
    据新华社西安电　陕西省许多地区正在大力开展炼焦生产，以满足钢铁工业的需要。
    截至17日止，全省已建起土焦炉二百七十多个，共炼出一万多吨焦炭。炼焦任务最大的渭北煤田铜川矿区，目前已经建成五十七个土焦炉，炼出焦炭八百八十多吨。十九个县、市的煤建公司，也积极利用库存焦煤进行土法炼焦。西安和宝鸡两个市的煤建公司，已将炼出的焦炭供给各个生产单位使用。
    陕西省煤炭工业局根据全省今年钢铁工业生产的需要和资源分布情况，决定在有条件炼焦的地区，短期内要建起一千五百多个土焦炉。
    本报长春21日电　长春市为了保证钢铁工业的需要，正在全市工厂、学校、机关、居民中组织全民炼焦。截至15日，全市已建成四百一十多座大窑，有一百多座投入了生产；正在建设和筹建的炼焦窑还有九百三十多座。预计到年底可炼焦十三万五千三百多吨，将超过原计划五千多吨。在全民炼焦中，各单位大都采取“以土为主，土洋结合”的方法，因而投资少，进度快。
    本报太原21日电　全国焦煤主要产地之一山西省，最近采取措施增加焦煤生产，支援全国各地钢铁工业的需要。
    山西省的焦煤供应着全国二十多个省市的三千多个工矿企业。今年1至8月，已经调运到这些地区的焦煤共达一百八十多万吨。但是随着全国钢铁工业的飞跃发展，预计9至12月的四个月内，需要供应的焦煤将超过二百万吨。目前，山西各煤矿生产单位掀起了日产千吨掌子、千里掘井的竞赛热潮，职工们为增产更多焦煤在昼夜苦战。估计仅挖掘现有生产矿井的潜力，就可增产二十多万吨焦煤外运。
    山西省煤炭管理部门最近还对焦煤供应工作进行了统筹安排，首先保证省外省内钢铁工业对焦煤的需要。经过这样挖掘增产潜力和统筹安排以后，山西省在今后四个月外运的焦煤将可超过1至8月份供应省外总数量的70％左右。
    新华社济南19日电　山东省在焦炭和废钢铁供应十分紧张的情况下，发扬共产主义的协作精神，决定立即调拨一万八千吨焦炭支援上海钢铁工业。这是这个省继上月份调给上海二万三千吨废钢铁之后的又一次支援行动。首批万吨焦炭日内即可装车启运，其余八千吨焦炭和一万二千吨废钢铁，也将加速调拨启运。
