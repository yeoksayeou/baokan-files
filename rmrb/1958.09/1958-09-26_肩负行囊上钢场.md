    Shouldering Backpacks to the Steel Mill

    In response to the call from the Central Committee to mobilize the entire Party and all the people to strive for an annual output of 10.7 million tons of steel, since late June, 137 students from departments such as physics, mathematics, and chemistry at Beijing Normal University have gone to Longyan Iron and Steel Company in Xuanhua and various parts of Shaanxi Province to support steel production.

    The first group of students from the physics and mathematics departments to arrive at Longyan Iron and Steel Company in Xuanhua participated in the basic construction work at the blast furnace site. At that time, the "One is Two, Five is Eight" (one person does the work of two, five people do the work of eight) campaign was in full swing on the construction site. Encouraged by this slogan with communist spirit, the students engaged in technical revolution. On the second day of their labor, the students created a method of transporting stones called "combined transportation of carts, chutes, and carrying poles" at the blast furnace site. Originally, they had to carry stones for two or three hundred meters, but now they only needed to carry them for about ten meters. Then they could push them in a cart for twenty or thirty meters, increasing work efficiency by nearly three times.

    The students who were assigned to fill the blast furnace foundation also created a "combined pulley and winch material transport method," which doubled work efficiency.

    The emergence of these two creations on the construction site promoted the technical revolution of the entire construction site.

    肩负行囊上钢场
    为了响应中央提出的全党全民齐动员，为年产1070万吨钢而奋斗的号召，自6月下旬起，北京师范学院已有物理、数学、化学等系一百三十七名同学远赴宣化龙烟钢铁公司和陕西各地支援钢铁生产。
    第一批到宣化龙烟钢铁公司的物理、数学两系同学，到达后就参加了高炉工地的基建劳动。当时工地上正在大搞“一顶二五八”（干活一个顶俩，五个顶五个）运动。同学们就在这个具有共产主义气魄口号的鼓舞下，大搞技术革命。参加劳动的第二天，同学们在高炉工地上创造了“小车、滑槽、扁担联合运输”的运石子方法。原来要挑着石子走二、三百米的路，现在只要挑十来米。再用小车推二、三十米远就行了，提高工作效率近三倍。
    被分配填高炉炉基的同学们，也创造了“定滑轮和辘辘联合运料法”，提高工作效率一倍。
    这两件创造在工地上的出现，推动了整个工地的技术革命。
