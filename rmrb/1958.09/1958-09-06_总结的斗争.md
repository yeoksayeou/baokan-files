　　The Struggle of Summarization
　　Tian Lianqian

    Some people, when summarizing and evaluating the work or a movement of a period, always oppose first affirming achievements, considering this to be old-fashioned formalism, believing it has the effect of numbing oneself. Some people even bring out theories such as "having achievements is as it should be, it goes without saying" to oppose talking about achievements. The case of Qianshan County in Jiangxi tells people that this view is completely wrong and harmful. Affirming achievements and not affirming achievements often have a significant impact in practical work, sometimes becoming the key to whether a cause can be carried on.

    This year, Qianshan County's two hundred thousand mu of early rice saw an average yield per mu jump from 284 jin last year to 458 jin, an increase of more than 60 percent, which should be said to be a great achievement. Such a rate of increase would have been impossible in the past. However, because this year was the first time to reform the farming system and cultivation system on a large scale, there was no experience in many things, and technical measures could not keep up, so the planned target of 600 jin per mu was not achieved. Compared with more advanced counties, the increase was not large enough. Therefore, cadres and the masses had a feeling of "dishonor." The original "skeptics" and "after-the-fact critics" also became active again. As a result, pessimistic emotions and negative public opinion such as "efforts in the first half of the year were wasted," "plans were too high," and "objective conditions were not good" enveloped the cadres and the masses. At this time, if the Party leadership is not clear-headed, does not make a correct assessment of the achievements of production in the first half of the year, or simply remains silent about wrong statements, the result will be that the revolutionary masses will be discouraged, right-leaning conservative forces will rise, plans for the next season and next year will be lowered, and measures to increase production will be relaxed.

    The Qianshan County Party Committee did not do this. They organized discussions and debates among the masses about the achievements and lessons learned in increasing production. After the debate, everyone saw that the efforts in the first half of the year were not wasted, and the achievements were greater than ever before. In this way, the negative arguments of "skeptics" and conservative forces were suppressed, the revolutionary masses and cadres raised their heads, and the courage and determination to move forward were restored and developed. Then, through specific research, and through comparing high yields and low yields, the reasons for not increasing production enough were found in a realistic manner, the reasons for the lodging of rice were found, and at the same time, the specific path to further increase production in the next season and next year was found. As a result, the masses confidently put forward higher targets on their own initiative, and with soaring enthusiasm and practical measures, they realized the targets they put forward. It can be affirmed that they will achieve even greater victories.

    Comrade Mao Zedong has told people more than once to "seek truth from facts." This sentence embodies the revolutionary stand of the working class, and also embodies the ideological method of dialectical materialism. When summarizing and evaluating work, whoever can seek truth from facts can see more correctly and more deeply, put forward better opinions and practices, mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, and make the work develop and progress faster. Whoever forgets this method will get the opposite result. And if people truly act according to the principle of seeking truth from facts, truly go deep into real life to investigate, and participate in real life and struggle, then he cannot fail to see the progress and new achievements every day, and he cannot fail to be encouraged by the new achievements (except for people with other positions). At that time, he will feel that it is unjust, inconsistent with the actual situation, and extremely harmful to not talk about achievements when summarizing work. Such a summary can only obscure the eyes of the masses, making it impossible for people to see the past, the future, the present, or the direction and path of progress revealed by the development of reality.

    What happened in Qianshan County also tells people that in every stage of mass production and construction, there will be some struggles, there will be struggles between two roads, and there will be struggles between correct ideas and wrong ideas. For these struggles, the best way is to organize mass airing of views and debates to clarify right and wrong, and to overcome wrong opinions with correct opinions. Failure to do so will seriously affect the cause of production and construction. Some people think that as long as production is increased, everything will be peaceful and well, but the facts in Qianshan County have proved that this is completely wrong. Old contradictions are resolved, and new contradictions will occur, which is the eternal law of the development of things.

　　总结的斗争
　　田连阡
    有一些人在总结和评价一段时期的工作或某一运动的时候，总是反对首先肯定成绩，认为这是老八股；认为有麻痹自己的作用。有些人还拿出“有成绩是应该的，不在话下”之类的理论来反对谈成绩。江西铅山县的事情告诉人们，这种意见是完全不对的和有害的。肯定成绩和不肯定成绩，在实际工作中时常发生重大的影响，有时候会成为事业能否干下去的关键。
    铅山县今年二十万亩早稻，平均亩产量由去年的二百八十四斤跃进到四百五十八斤，增产六成以上，这应当说是很大的成绩。这样的增产速度在过去是怎么也达不到的。然而，因为今年是第一次在大面积上改革耕作制度和栽培制度，许多事情没有经验，技术措施跟不上来，所以未能达到预定的亩产六百斤的指标。与更先进的县份相比，增产的幅度还不够大。所以在干部和群众中都有“不光彩”的感觉。原来的“怀疑派”和“秋后算账派”也重新活跃起来。于是，“上半年力气白费了”“计划太高了”和“客观条件不好”的失败主义情绪和消极舆论笼罩了干部和群众。这时候，如果党的领导上头脑不清醒，不对上半年生产的成绩作出正确的估价，或者仅仅对错误的说法默不作声，结果就会是革命群众灰心丧气，右倾保守势力抬头，把下季下年计划降低，增产措施放松。
    铅山县委没有这样做。他们在群众中组织了关于增产成绩和经验教训的讨论和辩论。经过辩论，大家都看到了今年上半年力气并没有白花，而且成绩之大为前所未有。这样，“怀疑派”和保守势力的消极论调被压下去了，革命的群众和干部抬起了头，前进的勇气和决心恢复了并且发展了。然后，经过具体研究，经过高产和低产的对比，实事求是地找出了许多增产还不够多的原因，找出稻禾倒伏的原因，同时也就找到了下一季下一年进一步增加生产的具体道路。于是，群众信心十足地自动提出了更高的指标，并且以冲天的干劲和切实的措施来实现自己提出的指标。可以肯定，他们将取得更加巨大的胜利。
    毛泽东同志不止一次地告诉人们要“实事求是”。这句话体现着工人阶级的革命的立场，也体现着辩证唯物主义的思想方法。在总结和评价工作的时候，谁能够实事求是，谁就能够看得比较正确，比较深刻，提出比较好的意见和做法，调动干部和群众的革命积极性，使工作更快地发展前进。谁忘记了这种方法，就会得到相反的结果。而人们如果真正根据实事求是的原则办事，真正深入到现实生活中进行考察，参加了现实的生活和斗争，那他也就不可能看不到每天的进展和新成就，不可能不为新的成就而欢欣鼓舞（别有立场的人除外）。那时候，他会感觉到总结工作时不谈成绩是不公正的，不符合实际情况的，也是极端有害的。这样的总结只能遮蔽群众的眼睛，使人看不清过去，也看不清将来，看不清现实，也看不到现实的发展所揭示出的前进的方向和道路。
    铅山县发生的事情还告诉人们：在群众生产和建设的每一个段落上，都会出现一些斗争，有两条道路的斗争，有正确思想和错误思想的斗争。对于这些斗争，最好的办法就是组织群众性的鸣放辩论来弄清是非，以正确意见克服错误意见。不这样做，就会使生产建设事业受到严重的影响。有些人以为只要增了产就会天下太平无事，铅山县的事实已经证明这是完全不对的。旧矛盾解决了，新矛盾还会发生，这是事物发展的永恒的规律。
