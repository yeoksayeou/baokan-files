Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 7th. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a press conference today that Taiwan and the coastal islands should belong to China. He said, "As far as we are concerned, we have recognized the People's Government of China, and we do not recognize Chiang Kai-shek."

Nehru said that India has no doubt that the coastal islands and Taiwan should be returned to China at a later time. He said that India's attitude is not only the case today, but has been the case from the very beginning seven or eight years ago.

He also said, "There are two parts to this issue: one is the basic Taiwan issue, and the other is part of this issue, the most urgent issue of the coastal islands. These coastal islands are more than ten nautical miles from the mainland. Obviously, no country would ever like or tolerate islands twelve nautical miles from its coast being used as a base to attack itself. It is surprising that this situation has continued until now."

Talking about the situation in the Taiwan Strait, Nehru said: "The situation is quite serious." He added: "We have been advocating a peaceful solution to this problem."

He reiterated: "In my mind, these islands undoubtedly must belong to China. This fact should be recognized, and action should be taken peacefully accordingly."

Regarding the width of China's territorial sea, Nehru said: "We have no reason to oppose it." If any problems arise, "we will try to reach an understanding on this issue." He explained: "If countries live together peacefully, the width does not really matter."

He said: "Naval powers always favor a limited width. At the recent Geneva conference, India hoped that the issue of territorial sea width would be decided by each country itself with certain restrictions."

When asked by a reporter whether US Secretary of the Army Bruck, who recently met with him here, had provided any explanations regarding the situation in Taiwan, Nehru said: "He did not provide any explanations on this issue. In fact, he didn't even mention the issue."

    尼赫鲁总理说
    台湾和沿海岛屿属于中国
    没有理由反对中国关于领海宽度的决定
    新华社新德里7日电　印度总理尼赫鲁今天在记者招待会上说，台湾和沿海岛屿应当属于中国。他说，“就我们而论，我们已经承认中国人民政府，我们不承认蒋介石。”
    尼赫鲁说，印度一点也不怀疑，沿海岛屿和台湾在稍后一些时候，应当归还中国。他说，印度这种态度不止今天是如此，而且在七八年前一开始就是如此。
    他还说，“关于这个问题有两部分，一是基本的台湾问题，另外是这个问题的一部分、最紧迫的沿海岛屿问题。这些沿海岛屿离开大陆十多海里。显而易见，任何一个国家都绝不会喜欢或者容忍离自己海岸十二海里的岛屿被用来作为进攻它自己的基地。令人惊奇的是，这种情况一直继续到现在。”
    谈到台湾海峡局势的时候，尼赫鲁说：“局势是相当严重的。”他又说：“我们一直在主张用和平方式解决这个问题。”
    他再次表明说：“在我的心目中，这些岛屿无疑地必须归于中国。应当承认这个事实，并且应当据此和平地采取行动。”
    关于中国领海的宽度问题，尼赫鲁说：“我们没有理由反对它。”如果发生了任何问题，“我们将设法就这个问题取得谅解。”他解释说：“如果各国和平相处，宽度多大实际上是没有关系的。”
    他说：“海军大国总是赞成有限度的。在最近日内瓦会议上，印度希望领海宽度问题在具有一定限制的情况下让各国自己去决定。”
    记者问到最近在这里跟他会见过的美国陆军部长布鲁克对于台湾的局势是否提供了一些说明，尼赫鲁说：“在这个问题上他没有提供任何说明。事实上，他甚至没有提到这个问题。”
