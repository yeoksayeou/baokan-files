Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th—Korean Deputy Prime Minister Nan Ri pointed out during a meeting with a reporter from the Japanese "Akahata" on the 25th that the U.S. aggressors' provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait area have intensified the tense situation in the Far East. He said that the Taiwan issue is entirely China's internal affair. If the U.S. aggressors disregard the warnings of the Chinese people and peace-loving people around the world and continue to play with fire in the Taiwan Strait area, they will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

Nan Ri also condemned the Kishida Nobusuke government of Japan for obstructing the just struggle of Korean citizens residing in Japan who demand to return to their homeland, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and for colluding with the Syngman Rhee clique, forcibly repatriating Korean residents detained in the Omura detention center in Japan to South Korea, thereby engaging in political speculation.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th—The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today refuting the fallacies of Eisenhower and Dulles regarding the so-called "ceasefire" in the Taiwan Strait area.

The editorial stated that the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait area is caused by the U.S. aggressive troops' forcible occupation of Taiwan. To eliminate the tense situation in this area, U.S. imperialism must immediately stop its military provocations in the area, withdraw its aggressive troops, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs. The editorial said that Eisenhower and Dulles, the chief culprits of aggression against China, are actually clamoring for a "ceasefire." The editorial asked, there is no war going on between China and the United States, so what "fire" needs to be "stopped"? The editorial said that the Chinese people's punitive military actions against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants entrenched in Kinmen and Matsu are a continuation of the Chinese People's Liberation War, which has been going on for many years, and are China's internal affairs in which no one can interfere. The U.S. aggressors' "ceasefire" rhetoric is nothing more than an attempt to cover up their aggressive actions in the face of world opinion.

    南日副首相提出警告
    美国继续玩火必遭惨败
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”痛斥美国“停火”阴谋
    新华社平壤26日电  朝鲜内阁副首相南日在25日接见日本“赤旗报”记者时指出，美国侵略者在台湾海峡地区的挑衅行动加剧了远东的紧张局势。他说，台湾问题完全是中国的内政问题。如果美国侵略者不顾中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的警告，继续在台湾海峡地区玩火，它必将遭到可耻的失败。
    南日还谴责日本岸信介政府妨碍侨居日本的朝鲜公民要求返回自己的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的正当斗争，并且勾结李承晚集团，强制把被扣留在日本大村收容所的朝鲜侨民遣送到南朝鲜，借此进行政治投机。
    据新华社平壤26日电  朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论，驳斥艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯提出的所谓在台湾海峡地区“停火”的谬论。
    社论说，台湾海峡地区的紧张局势是由于美国侵略军强占台湾所造成的。要消除这个地区的紧张局势，美帝国主义必须立即停止在这个地区的军事挑衅行为，并且撤出它的侵略军队，停止对中国人民内政的干涉。社论说，对中国进行侵略的主犯艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯竟叫嚣什么实现“停火”。社论问道，现在中美两国之间并没有进行战争，“停”什么“火”呢？社论说，关于中国人民对盘踞在金门、马祖的蒋介石残匪的惩罚性的军事行动，是已经进行了许多年的中国人民解放战争的延续，是任何人也不能干涉的中国人民的内政问题。美国侵略者提出“停火”的谰言，不过是为了在世界舆论面前掩盖他们的侵略行动。
