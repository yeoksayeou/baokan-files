Having just reported the good news to the entire factory from the broadcasting room about Li Zhewun, the representative of the hexagonal automatic team of the hexagonal workshop, I deliberately walked past the lathe team of the mechanical processing workshop to check on the situation. Returning, I quietly told Yu Junsheng, the foreman of the hexagonal automatic team:
    "That eight-foot belt lathe over there is broken again!"
    "Hmm!" Old Yu frowned, feeling as though a wad of chicken feathers was stuck in his heart, and hummed casually. Zhang Yougen, who was next to Old Yu, also heard this. He immediately turned off his lathe, said something to Old Yu, and left. Seeing this, Little Li spat fiercely to the side and said indignantly:
    "Someone who doesn't value collective honor!"
    How did this discord arise? It turns out, this is what happened.
    That day, the competition to seize key tasks and compete in enthusiasm was in full swing. Yu Junsheng, the representative of the hexagonal automatic team of the hexagonal automatic workshop, designated the lathe team of the mechanical processing workshop as his opponent. Old Yu designated this team because, first, they were both lathe teams; second, in the past stage, although the two teams had not formally entered into a competition agreement, they had been silently chasing each other, and their results had always been neck and neck. After Old Yu finished speaking and stepped down from the stage, he heard Little Li leading everyone in his team shouting:
    "The hexagonal team is determined,
    To compete with everyone with enthusiasm;
    Which team dares to compete,
    Quickly come on stage and accept the challenge!"
    Jin Yuliang, the foreman of the lathe team, upon hearing this, immediately gathered several people in his team together and discussed it: their team's technical strength and personnel allocation were no worse than the hexagonal team's. However, they were using several old lathes, and the eight-foot belt lathe was the only large lathe in the entire team, which might make the competition somewhat difficult. But no one was willing to admit defeat, so they immediately sent Jin Yuliang as their representative to hastily go on stage and accept the challenge. Once offstage, the lathe team started shouting:
    "Hexagonal team, listen clearly,
    We are determined to compete with you for victory;
    We are not boasting,
    Catching up with you will be easy!"
    By the time the meeting was over, it was already ten o'clock. The people from both teams, not bothering to go home to rest, invited the Party Committee Secretary, the Factory Director, and the heads of both workshops that very night to participate in and sign the competition agreement.
    The lathe team carefully divided the work and even assigned two people specifically to maintain the equipment. The shifts were also adjusted to ensure that the machines were running twenty-four hours a day while the workers rested. The hexagonal team underestimated their opponents, thinking that their equipment was new and efficient. As a result, the lathe team took the lead from the beginning, and by the time the hexagonal team realized it, they couldn't catch up.
    The lathe team had a successful start, but the machines were old after all. Despite the careful maintenance by two people, they still often malfunctioned, especially the eight-foot lathe, which was carrying the biggest workload, and it had even more problems. Seizing this opportunity, the hexagonal team was about to catch up with the lathe team. Therefore, some people in the hexagonal team pinned their hopes on the lathe team's machines. Whenever the lathe team's machines stopped, they would secretly rejoice, and Little Li was one such person. Coincidentally, Zhang Yougen's wife, Tang Yuzhen, was in the lathe team, and she was the one who operated that eight-foot belt lathe. Whenever this lathe malfunctioned, Zhang Yougen was even more anxious than when his own lathe broke down, because Yuzhen's skills were lower than his; at the same time, the lathe team's work was critical to the entire factory. Therefore, at such times, he would always put down his own work first to help Yuzhen repair the lathe. Little Li and his group naturally disagreed with this, and that's how the discord arose.
    In those few days, Yuzhen's lathe broke down several times in a row, stopping for several days, and the hexagonal team far surpassed them. Who knew that this time, Zhang Yougen would once again help the lathe team to repair the lathe as before? Little Li understood in his heart that as long as the lathe team's lathe was repaired, they would still be able to catch up with them, so he was even more dissatisfied with Zhang Yougen.
    After Zhang Yougen had been gone for a while, he came back and said to Old Yu with a frown: "It's a problem. Master Wang from the machine repair workshop said that it needs a major overhaul before it can be used. A major overhaul will take at least three or four days, and the end of the month is near, which is when we need parts..." Yougen seemed to have forgotten that the two teams were competing, and he was as anxious as if his own team had a problem. When Old Yu heard Yougen say this, he also became very anxious. Suddenly, he seemed to have discovered something and said to Yougen: "Our work isn't urgent. I'll go and discuss it with the workshop director to let us do their work first!" Yougen's eyes seemed to light up when he heard this. Old Yu turned around and went to find the director.
    A moment later, Old Yu returned and called a meeting of the team. Old Yu had only said a few sentences when Little Li and the others began to discuss it one after another. Old Yu patiently explained to everyone:
    "Comrades! This competition of ours is for the purpose of improving production! Only caring about ourselves and not caring about others, can this still be called socialist thinking?" Several people immediately agreed, and Little Li and the others muttered a few words but stopped speaking.
    After the lathe team's lathe was repaired, the hexagonal team also helped to finish the remaining work. However, the work that the hexagonal team was supposed to do was not completed until the last few days of the month.
    Competitions are supposed to determine winners and losers, but in this case, it was difficult to determine who had won or lost: the hexagonal automatic team refused to admit that they had won, because their work was not completed until the end; the lathe team also refused to admit that they had won, because this batch of work was not completed by them alone. At this time, even Little Li, who cherished his team's honor the most, was unwilling to admit that his team had won. The matter was brought to the Party Committee Secretary, who said to them: "The lathe team won, but the hexagonal team also won. Comrades, the purpose of the competition is to promote production. Whoever serves socialism well will receive socialist honor. However, socialist honor cannot be obtained solely by one person, one team, or one workshop by removing all other factors. The hexagonal team was able to sacrifice their own time to help the lathe team do the key work first, and they have achieved true honor..."
    Warm applause interrupted the Party Committee Secretary's words. In the applause, Little Li blushed and lowered his head. After a while, he also joined everyone in applauding enthusiastically.

    真正的荣誉
    澎洁
    刚从广播室向全厂职工报了捷回来的六角车间六角自动小组的代表——李哲文，有意从机械加工车间车床小组边走过，探了一探情况，回来悄悄地告诉六角自动小组的工段长俞俊生说：
    “那边一台八尺皮带床子又坏了！”
    “嗯！”老俞皱了皱眉毛，心里像塞了一团鸡毛似的，随便地哼了一声，老俞身旁的张友根也听到了，他随即关上了床子，和老俞说了句什么话，就走了。小李见到了，狠狠地向旁边吐了口唾沫，愤愤地说：
    “不珍贵集体荣誉的人！”
    这个瓜葛，是怎么造成的呢？原来是这么一回事。
    那天，抢关键、赛干劲大会正开得热火朝天，六角自动车间六角自动小组的代表俞俊生指名的对手是机械加工车间的车工小组。老俞指名这个小组，因为一、同是车工组；二、过去一阶段，两个组虽没立过竞赛条约比赛过，但两组却默默地、互相追赶着，成绩始终不相上下。老俞讲完话，刚下了台，他听到自己小组里小李领着大家高呼：
    “六角小组有决心，
    愿和大家比干劲；
    那个小组敢较量，
    赶快上台把战应！”
    车工小组工长金玉良一听，马上把组内几个人召集在一起，商量了一下：自己组里的技术力量，人员配备，哪一样都不比六角组差，可是，用的都是几台旧床子，一台八尺皮带床，还是全组唯一的一台大床子，比起来，恐怕有些困难。但谁也不甘拜下风，于是马上派了金玉良作为代表，匆匆地上台应了战。一下台，车工组便叫了起来：
    “六角小组要听清，
    决心和你们比输赢；
    我们不是说大话，
    赶上你们不费劲！”
    散了会，已将十点了，两个小组的人马顾不得回家休息，当晚就邀请了党委书记、厂长和两个车间的正副主任参加，签订了竞赛条约。
    车工组仔细地分了工，还专派了两个人维护设备，班次也经过了调整，尽量做到一天二十四小时人歇机器不歇。六角小组轻敌，认为自己设备新、效率高，因此，一开始，车工组就占了上风，待六角组发现时，追也追不上了。
    车工组旗开得胜，可是，机器到底是旧了，尽管两个人细心维护，但还是经常出毛病，尤其那台担负使命最大的八尺床子，出的毛病更多。趁这个机会，六角组差不多要追上车工组。因此，六角组里，就有几个人把希望寄托在车工组的机器上了。车工组的机器一停，他们就暗暗地欣庆，小李就属于这样的一个人。说也巧，六角组张友根的爱人唐玉珍就是车工组的，那台八尺皮带床子，就是她使唤的。一遇到这台床子出毛病，张友根比自己床子出毛病还要心急，因为玉珍的技术比他低；同时，车工组的活是全厂的关键，因此，到这个时候，他总要先放下自己的活，帮玉珍修床子，小李那伙人，自然不同意，因此就闹成了这样的瓜葛。
    那几天，玉珍那台床子一连坏了几次，停了几天，六角组远远地超过他们。谁知这次张友根又像以前一样，帮助车工组去修床子去了，小李心里明白，只要车工组床子修好，还是能赶上他们的，因此他更加不满张友根了。
    张友根去了一会儿，回来皱着眉头对老俞说：“成问题了，机修车间王师傅说，得大修一下才能用。大修一次最少得三、四天，眼看月底，正是要零件的时候……”友根仿佛忘了两个组正在竞赛，像自己小组出了问题一样着急。老俞听友根这么一讲，也非常着急。忽然，他像发现了什么似的，对友根说：“我们这个活不急，我去和车间主任商量一下，先替他们干！”友根一听，眼睛像闪出了光。老俞回过身就去找主任去了。
    片刻，老俞回来，召集组里的人开了个会。老俞刚讲了几句，小李他们就纷纷议论起来，老俞耐心地向大家解释：
    “同志们！咱们这个竞赛，是为了搞好生产呀！光管自己，不管别人，这还叫社会主义思想吗？”马上有几个人同意了，小李他们嘴里嘟嚷了几句，也就不言语了。
    车工组的床子修好后，六角组又帮着把剩余的活做完了，可是，六角组自己应做的活，拖到月底最后几天才做完。
    竞赛是应该决定胜负的，可是，这一来，胜负却很难决定了：六角自动小组不肯承认自己得胜，因为自己的活到最后才完；车工组也不承认自己得胜，因为这批活不是自己作完的。这时候，连最珍视自己小组荣誉的小李，也不愿承认自己得胜了。事情闹到党委书记那里，党委书记对他们说：“车工组得胜，但六角组也得胜。同志们，竞赛的目的本来就是为了促进生产，谁为社会主义服务得好，他就能得到社会主义的荣誉。但是，社会主义的荣誉是不可去掉一切其他因素，光凭一个人、一个小组、一个车间就能单独取得的。六角组能牺牲自己的时间，先帮助车工组干关键活，他就取得了真正的荣誉……”
    热烈的鼓掌声，打断了党委书记的话，小李在鼓掌声中，红着脸，低着头，一会儿他也跟大家一起热烈地鼓起掌来。
