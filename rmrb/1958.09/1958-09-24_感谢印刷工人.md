    Thanks to the Printing Workers
    Guo Min
    Before the Great Leap Forward, advertisements for delayed publication of periodicals were frequently found in newspapers. But recently, many periodicals have been published on time and delivered to readers promptly. This is a leap forward in editorial work, but the printing factory's contribution is also significant.
    Based on technological reforms, all employees of the Xinhua Printing Factory have greatly shortened production time. The production of "Current Events Handbook" from receiving the manuscript to completion has been reduced from the original eight days to three and a half days; "Political Study" from twelve days to three and a half days; "World Knowledge" from nine days to five days; "Study" magazine from fifteen days to four days; and "People's Literature" from twenty-eight days to nineteen days.
    In previous years, magazines always required manuscripts to be submitted a month in advance for monthly publications, and half a month in advance for bi-monthly publications. If this issue wasn't published, the next issue had to be prepared. Many time-sensitive manuscripts often couldn't be squeezed in and had to wait for the next issue (which meant next month or the latter half of the month) to meet the readers. Some issues with rapidly changing situations lost their timeliness when they were published and became after-the-fact comments.
    Now, with this change, magazines can delay the submission of manuscripts and fully reflect the latest issues, even running ahead of events and playing a guiding role.
    Thanks to the typesetters, printing workers, and binding workers in the printing factory. Without your hard work, this leap forward would not be possible. The benefits you have brought to cultural undertakings are immeasurable.

    感谢印刷工人
    郭敏
    在大跃进之前，刊物的出版延期的广告在报纸上是经常可以找到的，可是最近许多刊物都能按时出版，及时的送到读者手中，这是编辑工作的跃进，可是印刷厂的功劳也不小。
    新华印刷厂全体职工在技术改革的基础上，大大缩短了生产时间。“时事手册”的生产从接稿到出齐由原来八天减到三天半，“政治学习”从十二天减到三天半，“世界知识”从九天减到五天，“学习”杂志从十五天减到四天，“人民文学”从二十八天减到十九天。
    前几年出杂志总是月刊要一个月前就发稿，半月刊要半月前发稿，这期没出版，下一期的就要准备好了。许多有时间性的稿件往往挤不上去，而必须等下期（这就是说要下月或下半月）才能和读者见面，有些形势变化快的问题，等登出来时已失去了时效，成为马后炮。
    现在这一改变，杂志就能延迟发稿，而充分反映最新的问题，甚至跑在事情的前面起了指导的作用。
    感谢印刷厂的排字工人、印刷工人、装订工人，没有你们辛勤的努力，这种跃进是不可能的。你们给文化事业带来的好处是不可估量的。
