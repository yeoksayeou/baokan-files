Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Leading figures from China's various democratic parties have issued statements expressing their firm support for Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area, and strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' military provocations and acts of war threat in interfering in China's internal affairs.

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, stated: We fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area and pledge our full support for all necessary measures taken by our government to defend our territorial sovereignty, stop U.S. imperialist aggression, and safeguard peace in the Far East and the world.

The U.S. government's armed occupation of China's territory Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and the massive deployment of armed forces in China's coastal areas to carry out war provocations, is shamelessly claimed to be for the purpose of ensuring U.S. security and maintaining peace and order in the Far East. This is utterly barbaric and absurd. This robber-like behavior of the U.S. government has not only aroused the boundless anger of our people, but has also been unanimously opposed and strongly condemned by all peace-loving people and countries around the world. We love peace, but we are not afraid of war. The Chinese people, who have long seen through the paper tiger that is U.S. imperialism, will absolutely not be intimidated by the menacing gestures of Eisenhower and Dulles.

Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, stated: U.S. imperialism has recently been flexing its muscles in the Taiwan Strait area, massively concentrating its forces, and attempting to invade Jinmen, Mazu, and other inland islands of our country. This is a war provocation against the Chinese people and the most serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world. On behalf of the China Democratic League, I firmly support Premier Zhou Enlai's righteous and stern statement. We Chinese people love peace, but we will never allow our territorial sovereignty to be invaded and interfered with by imperialist pirates. If U.S. imperialism dares to impose war on the Chinese people, 600 million people will wage a resolute struggle against aggression and in defense of peace, and bury the invading enemy at the bottom of the Taiwan Strait.

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, stated: Premier Zhou's statement made a solemn refutation of the U.S. imperialists' acts of aggression and provocation, and once again told the world the determination of the Chinese people to liberate their own territory—Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. Anyone who is reasonable and just, after reading Premier Zhou's statement, cannot but admit that justice and truth are on the side of the Chinese people, and that the behavior of the U.S. imperialists is completely that of robbers. The Chinese people had the strength to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule nine years ago, and our People's Volunteers had the strength to fight alongside the Korean People's Army to drive the U.S. troops south of the 38th parallel. Now, the Chinese people are building socialism at a speed of one day equals twenty years. How can we be afraid of the intimidation of U.S. imperialism and war merchants like Dulles?

Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, stated: Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. The Chinese people have every right to liberate their own territory. This is the sacred task of all the people of the country and is our internal affair. We will not allow U.S. imperialism to interfere under any pretext. If U.S. imperialism is bent on its own way and imposes war on the Chinese people, all my members will, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, fight the enemy to the end together with the people of the whole country.

Ji Fang, Acting Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, stated: The U.S. imperialists directly use force to occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to carry out various harassments and sabotage activities against the Chinese mainland. Recently, they have further concentrated a large number of armed forces in the Taiwan Strait area, openly threatening to expand their aggression in the Taiwan Strait area to coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu. This is the most serious provocation against the Chinese people, and the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate it. If the U.S. government insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, we will, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and together with the people of the whole country, wage the most resolute struggle against U.S. interference in our internal affairs and for the liberation of our territory, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands.

Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, stated: After the U.S. imperialists launched armed intervention in the Middle East, they were opposed and angrily denounced by Arab countries and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, as well as peace-loving countries and people all over the world. Not only did they not learn a lesson and withdraw their invading troops from the Middle East in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting, but in order to divert the world's attention from their continued aggression in the Middle East and delay the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon, they concentrated a large number of armed forces in the Taiwan Strait area of our country, further threatening our country and peace in the Far East. Premier Zhou Enlai's solemn statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China is once again a warning to the shameless provocations of U.S. imperialism. Our China Zhi Gong Party will definitely support Premier Zhou's statement with practical actions.

Tu Changwang, Executive Committee Member and Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, stated: We are extremely angry when we hear the war provocations statement by the war-monger Dulles, who is hostile to the Chinese people and interferes in our internal affairs. In the past few years, U.S. imperialism has stretched out its claws of aggression in Korea and the Middle East, but it has suffered shameful defeats everywhere. If U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war in the Taiwan Strait area and interfere in China's internal affairs, it will inevitably be met with head-on blows in the face of the powerful Chinese people and the world's peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp, and suffer more severe and devastating blows than ever before. All members of our Jiusan Society are determined to stand firmly with the people of the whole country and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions, and we will never give up until we achieve our goal.

Responsible persons of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League stated: Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. It is entirely China's internal affair for the Chinese people to exercise sovereignty and liberate these areas. This is the sacred and inviolable right of the Chinese people. The United States' support for the Chiang Kai-shek group and its direct use of force to occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands is an illegal act that interferes in China's internal affairs and infringes on China's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Any war provocation by the United States will absolutely not scare us. We must strengthen our work under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and strive to liberate our hometown—Taiwan—to the end.

    各民主党派负责人坚决拥护周总理声明
　　誓以实际行动支持政府保卫领土主权
    新华社7日讯　我国各民主党派中央领导人发表谈话，表示坚决拥护周恩来总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义干涉我国内政的军事挑衅和战争威胁的行为。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深发表谈话说：我们完全拥护周恩来总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，誓以全力支持我国政府为保卫我国领土主权，制止美帝国主义侵略，维护远东及世界和平所采取的一切必要措施。
    美国政府武装霸占我国领土台湾和澎湖列岛，在我国沿海地区大量集结武装力量，进行战争挑衅，竟厚颜无耻地说是为了保障美国的安全和维持远东的和平秩序，真是横蛮透顶，荒谬绝伦。美国政府这种强盗行为，不仅激起了我们全国人民无比的愤怒，同时也遭受到全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家的一致反对和严厉谴责。我们热爱和平，但是也决不害怕战争。早就把美帝国主义这只纸老虎戳穿了的中国人民，是绝对不会为艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯张牙舞爪的威胁所吓倒的。
    中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒发表谈话说：美国帝国主义最近在台湾海峡地区，张牙舞爪，大量集结兵力，企图进犯金门、马祖等我国内海岛屿，这是对我国人民的战争挑衅，也是对远东和世界和平的最严重威胁。我代表中国民主同盟坚决拥护周恩来总理的义正词严的声明，我们中国人民热爱和平，但是决不容许我国领土主权遭受帝国主义海盗的侵犯干涉。美国帝国主义要是敢于把战争强加在中国人民头上，六亿人民一定要为反对侵略、保卫和平，进行坚决的斗争，把侵犯的敌人埋葬在台湾海峡的海底。
    中国民主建国会中央委员会主任委员黄炎培发表谈话说：周总理的声明对美帝国主义的侵略和挑衅的行为作了严正的批驳，把中国人民解放自己领土——台湾和澎湖列岛的决心再一度告诉全世界。任何一个讲道理、讲是非的人看了周总理的声明，不能不承认正义和真理是在中国人民这一边，美帝的行为是十足的强盗行径。中国人民在九年以前有力量推翻蒋介石的反动统治，我们的志愿军有力量同朝鲜人民军一起把美帝的军队打到三八线以南，现在，中国人民正以一天等于二十年的速度在建设社会主义，我们难道会怕美帝国主义、杜勒斯之流的战争贩子的恫吓吗？
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦发表谈话说：台湾和澎湖列岛自古就是中国的领土。中国人民完全有权解放自己的领土。这是全国人民的神圣任务，是我国的内政，决不容许美帝国主义以任何借口横加干涉。如果美帝执迷不悟，把战争强加在中国人民的头上，我会全体会员，一定在中国共产党领导下，同全国人民一道，跟敌人斗争到底。
    中国农工民主党代理主席季方发表谈话说：美帝国主义者直接用武力侵占台湾和澎湖列岛，并支持蒋介石卖国集团对中国大陆进行种种骚扰和破坏活动，最近更进一步在台湾海峡地区大量集结武装力量，公开威胁要把它在台湾海峡地区的侵略范围扩大到金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，这是对我国人民最严重的挑衅，中国人民绝对不能容忍。如果美国政府一定要把战争强加在中国人民的头上，我们将在中国共产党领导之下和全国人民一道，为反对美国干涉我国内政、解放我国领土台湾和澎湖列岛作最坚决的斗争。
    中国致公党主席陈其尤发表谈话说：美帝国主义对中东发动武装干涉遭到阿拉伯国家和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家以及全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的反对和愤怒指摘之后，不仅没有吸取教训按照联合国大会紧急会议的决议撤出在中东的侵略军队，而且为了转移世界人民对于它在中东继续侵略，拖延自黎巴嫩撤兵的注意，竟在我国台湾海峡地区大量集结武装力量，进一步威胁我国和远东和平。周恩来总理为此代表中华人民共和国政府发表了关于台湾海峡地区局势的严正声明，是再一次对美帝国主义这种无耻挑衅的警告。我们中国致公党一定以实际行动来拥护周总理的声明。
    九三学社中央常务委员兼秘书长涂长望发表谈话说：我们听到战争贩子杜勒斯敌视中国人民、干涉我国内政的战争挑衅声明，感到万分愤怒。美国帝国主义几年来在朝鲜、中东地区，都伸出了它侵略的魔爪，但到处遭到可耻的惨败。如果美帝国主义胆敢在台湾海峡地区发动战争，干涉中国内政，在强大的中国人民和世界和平民主、社会主义阵营面前，必将碰得头破血流，遭到比以往任何时候更为严重的毁灭性的打击。我们九三学社全体社员坚决和全国人民一道，用实际行动来支持解放台湾的斗争，不达到目的，决不罢休。
    台湾民主自治同盟负责人发表谈话说：台湾和澎湖列岛自古就是中国的领土。中国人民行使主权解放这些地区，完全是中国的内政。这是中国人民神圣不可侵犯的权利。美国支持蒋介石集团，并且直接用武力侵占台湾和澎湖列岛，是干涉中国内政，侵犯中国领土完整和主权的非法行为。美国的任何战争挑衅都绝对吓不倒我们的。我们一定要在中国共产党领导下，加紧工作，为解放我们的家乡——台湾，而奋斗到底。
