Paving a New Road for Philosophy Teaching
A Report on the Teaching Reform of the Department of Philosophy, Peking University
Feng Ding

Since this spring, amid the wave of teaching reform in major colleges and universities across the country, the Department of Philosophy at Peking University has also witnessed a "revolutionary situation" where "teachers can no longer teach in the old way, and students can no longer learn in the old way." As a result, one big-character poster after another, one big debate after another, no one could avoid thinking, no one could avoid speaking, no one could avoid writing, and no one could avoid doing.

**Initial Battle**

The debate began with whether or not the Department of Philosophy was necessary.

With the great ideological liberation of the people, philosophy has fallen from the ethereal realm to the human world. Everyone can talk about philosophy, everything can be discussed philosophically. The vast number of workers, peasants, and laborers are also learning philosophy, and they can understand it. Therefore, a philosophy department like the old one, year after year, batch after batch, recruiting dozens or hundreds of young people with neither political experience nor production experience, gnawing on a few books, memorizing a few dogmas, what is the purpose, what is the effect? This is worthy of doubt. If it is only because a comprehensive university must have a Department of Philosophy, and the Department of Philosophy is run for the sake of running a Department of Philosophy, that is not a sufficient reason. Therefore, whether the old Department of Philosophy is necessary is a matter that should be greatly discussed and specially discussed.

However, after the initial battle, it was only then that it was known that those who doubted the necessity of the Department of Philosophy did not start from the above-mentioned arguments, but from other different standpoints. First, some people established a formula of "theory - practice - theory," believing that philosophy is ultimately the highest abstraction, the highest theory; therefore, it must originate from theory and return to theory. They said that if philosophy must combine theory with practice, must follow the formula of "practice - theory - practice," and only those who understand theory and can combine it with practice can be called philosophers, then the title of "philosopher" should be given to those who combine theory with practice. Those engaged in philosophy teaching in the Department of Philosophy, and those the Department of Philosophy wants to cultivate, might as well humbly be called "philosophy workers." Either cultivate such philosophy workers, then the Department of Philosophy is necessary; otherwise, the Department of Philosophy is not necessary.

The result of the initial battle reversed the topic. Everyone believed that philosophy is the science of the universal laws of motion and development of nature, human society, and thought. It is both a world view and a methodology, and it comes from practice, returns to practice, and builds on the past. As a subject of study, the more that everyone can talk about it and everything can be discussed philosophically, the more indispensable it becomes. According to the development trend of our socialist society, philosophy will undoubtedly become something for all the people. At that time, whether philosophical teaching should still adopt the organizational form of establishing a Department of Philosophy in a comprehensive university is a matter that can be greatly discussed. Even comprehensive universities themselves, from the historical conditions of their emergence, when the boundaries between cities and villages, workers and peasants, manual laborers and mental laborers gradually disappear, whether they must always maintain their current all-encompassing appearance, immensely huge and immensely concentrated, is also a matter that can be greatly discussed. But these are all far from today's matters. Today, universities must be popularized, philosophy departments must be popularized, and therefore the original universities and philosophy departments must not be discarded, but must be reformed.

**Revealing the Truth**

The initial battle showed that not wanting the Department of Philosophy was precisely not wanting teaching reform. It also showed that what was to be discussed was how to reform, not whether or not it was necessary. With the reversal of the topic, each other's true intentions were revealed. Originally, quite a few people had more or less resistance to the policy of education serving politics and the combination of education and productive labor.

After so many ideological remolding movements with political overtones, the principle of education serving politics is, at least on the surface, hardly opposed by anyone. However, combining education with productive labor, and including student participation in labor as a formal course, is difficult for many people to accept. Thus, a new climax of debate was triggered.

Those who disagreed with participating in labor did not launch a frontal, comprehensive attack on the combination of education with productive labor, but put forward many arguments to prevent this from being implemented. The most prominent of these was the "division of labor theory." In addition, there were "waste theory," "quality reduction theory," and so on, all of which revolved around the "division of labor theory." Those who advocated the "division of labor theory" believed that there would still be a division of labor in communist society; the social division of labor for "philosophy workers" is to engage in philosophy, to study philosophical works, so they should not engage in simple physical labor. At least during the transition period, such a division of labor is completely necessary.

After debate, the vast majority of people believed that: it is incorrect to drag in the idea that there will still be a division of labor in communist society. Because in communist society, everyone, starting from childhood, both learns and labors; first, they are all knowledgeable productive laborers, and then there is a professional division of labor. Moreover, the profession mastered by each person is not limited to just one, and may have two or even several. As for the division of labor between manual labor and mental labor, it will never exist again. Even today, hundreds of millions of workers and peasants are working hard to produce, while also working hard to learn culture, technology, and philosophy, and striving to be "versatile" and "all-rounders," being both workers and peasants, both laborers and intellectuals. In reality, they are already aiming in the direction of communism. To confuse the rational professional division of labor among knowledgeable laborers with the unreasonable division of labor between mental and physical labor in class society is a "misattribution" that must be exposed. Now, although there is still a distinction between intellectuals and workers and peasants, this phenomenon has in fact begun to disappear. Now, workers and peasants with rich labor experience are advancing towards knowledge. However, intellectuals with only book knowledge still want to use the excuse of division of labor to make "this generation" or even "this individual" stay detached from reality for a lifetime, in order to live the life of an old-fashioned intellectual for life, which is truly a complete opposition to the times, and is not beneficial to oneself, not to mention to others and to socialist construction. In fact, productive labor is the source of knowledge; studying philosophy, if it is not to indulge in the analysis of "pure concepts" such as understanding and reason, and regard it as "an amusement rather than a toil" (Kant), but to truly understand materialism, truly understand dialectics, and apply it to practice, one must and should first join the masses and throw oneself into the practice of productive labor.

**Settling the Case**

After repeated debates, the vast majority of those who originally disagreed with participating in labor, especially some young students, have changed, or at least no one insists on the old view. Thus, the new education plan was largely finalized.

The new education plan implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, and included participation in productive labor in the formal curriculum. Everyone believed that participating in labor is to enable us to acquire production knowledge and experience the feelings of the masses. Therefore, the method of participating in labor cannot rely solely on teachers and students running some small-scale factories and managing a few acres of farmland; nor can it still be based on classroom teaching, or go to factories and rural areas from time to time for half a day or a day, or slightly longer, like skimming the surface of water, just to find some scattered examples for a chapter or section of a book; but must spend a longer period of time, say a year, throwing oneself into the vast number of workers and peasants, living together, learning together, and laboring together; and conduct some investigation and research work related to rural areas and factories, in order to systematically understand the production process of a cooperative or an enterprise. In addition, since we are intellectuals, then in addition to learning from workers and peasants mainly in labor production to enrich our knowledge, we should naturally remove errors and dross from the knowledge we already have, and try to combine it with the actual situation of workers and peasants, and spread it. However, we must never behave as "teachers" here, but must still be in the position of "students," identifying the original knowledge in practice, in order to know what should be eliminated and what should be retained and enriched and developed. We can also collaborate with workers and peasants to write philosophy readers for them, writing, using, and revising at the same time; breaking the original system and trying to use the production process of factories and rural areas as the system, and inserting the content of basic philosophical knowledge separately. We are both students of workers and peasants, and should also become propagandists, organizers, people who are trained by the new education and implement the new education.

Recently, it has been considered that all students in the department, in addition to the old students led by some teachers to the countryside for a year in order to explore some experience in both laboring and learning, all the freshmen in the first year also plan to enter the factory for a year, laboring and learning philosophy together with the workers; learning philosophy from the actual combination of politics and production, with those who are capable acting as teachers, and discussing and debating together to acquire basic philosophical knowledge. One year in the factory, half a year back to school to summarize experience and engage in on-campus study. Another year in the countryside, half a year back to school to summarize experience and engage in on-campus study. The remaining two years will be mainly spent studying at school. However, even when studying at school, a certain amount of time should still be set aside to participate in temporary, short-term labor, or to do some investigation and research work that touches reality.

**Deepening**

Everyone believed that philosophy can be learned by men and women, old and young, and it will become something for all the people sooner or later. But this does not prevent philosophy from being deepened as a specialized discipline, becoming the specialized business of some people. Does this statement return to the views of the old philosophers? Not at all.

Everyone knows that popularization and improvement are a unity of opposites. Popularization and improvement are forever transforming into each other in the process of advancement. Without popularization as the foundation, there is no improvement. When everyone is combining labor with knowledge, when everyone becomes both a worker-peasant and an intellectual, anyone can and will improve or deepen a certain specialized business on the basis of having an increasingly rich basic knowledge; for example, the significance and value of improving or deepening knowledge in departments such as termites, rats, rice, wheat, sweet potatoes, corn, chemistry, physics, etc., will never be lower or less than that of engaging in the improvement and deepening of the most generalized philosophical knowledge. Therefore, we are not opposed to improvement and deepening, but we must first become ordinary laborers with basic knowledge before we can move forward to specialized business.

We are not opposed to studying the history of Western philosophy or its one school and one family. The same is true for the history of Eastern philosophy or its one school and one family. As for studying the various schools and families of ancient Chinese philosophy, it goes without saying. In addition, various kinds of textual research, exegesis, or other data work are also to be done. But the most important thing in learning philosophy is to establish a correct stand, viewpoint, and method, in order to transform the world. Therefore, first, one must never use this as a measure to say that only those who are engaged in research, in sorting out materials, etc., are worthy of being called philosophers or philosophy workers, and those who can use the Marxist philosophical viewpoint to summarize and analyze practical problems are not worthy of being called philosophers or philosophy workers. Secondly, those who are engaged in research, in sorting out materials, etc., must first be people who are connected with production and connected with the masses, and are still participating in labor and participating in political struggle at all times, and understand how to use the correct viewpoint and method to do textual research, exegesis, or other data work; otherwise, they are completely detached bookworms. Thirdly, it is necessary to assign this kind of research, sorting out materials, etc., to a very small number of people, but it is not right to think that whoever learns philosophy must do this, and to concentrate the greatest effort on the ancient era in studying the history of philosophy, with less on the modern era, and even less on the contemporary era. The weight of these quantities has a qualitative significance, which is not right. Therefore, everyone believes that students of the Department of Philosophy at Peking University should first become socialist laborers with some basic philosophical knowledge, and secondly cultivate the ability to analyze the reality of socialist society using the correct method. After graduation, they can engage in any suitable full-time profession, but at least they should be able to do socialist ideological education work, and be able to speak philosophy to the vast number of working people in a language and examples that are welcomed and loved by the vast number of working people. As for those engaged in research and sorting out work, this is not the general training goal. These tasks should be undertaken by graduate students and those who engage in philosophy professionally after graduating from university. But it can only be a very small number of them, or simply be a part-time job for some engaged in philosophy professionally.

**Contention**

Carrying out such a reform in philosophy teaching does not hinder the implementation of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend." Everyone believed that the ideological liberation of the vast number of working people, especially the rich and fresh thoughts they have shown in the great leap forward of socialist construction, will make philosophy shine brightly. But correct ideas always have to struggle against erroneous ideas. Therefore, while learning philosophy, one must also criticize erroneous ideas. For those engaged in philosophy professionally, in addition to criticizing superstition and all kinds of backward ideas, they also need to know what important idealist ideas have existed throughout history, in order to enrich the content of criticism, so that academic debates can become more active.

Peking University has many old professors who have studied idealist philosophy. Therefore, in order to establish the opposite of philosophical thought, activate contention, and develop criticism, Peking University has particularly good conditions. Everyone believed that these old professors are suitable for doing translation work, also suitable for doing research work, and can still engage in teaching at the same time. Now, there are very few people who openly praise idealism, and some people are very willing to criticize their old idealist philosophical ideas, but there may still be doubts as to whether some of the arguments of idealist philosophy are completely incorrect, or whether they can be completely refuted. Therefore, everyone believed that, on the one hand, if old professors are willing to criticize their old idealist philosophical ideas, they may carry out criticism together with other people, including students. On the other hand, they can still give lectures to students, introducing idealist philosophical ideas. Or, in addition to general translation and research work, they can also conduct research on some arguments of idealist philosophy that they believe are not easy to refute, in order to write the research results into lecture notes and distribute them to students. At the same time, they can also give concise lectures to students, allowing everyone to debate. In this way, old professors can still give full play to their expertise and promote the activity of philosophical debate. However, everyone believed that the proportion of the introduction of idealist philosophical ideas in teaching must not exceed the proportion of Marxist philosophy in teaching, nor should it "divide the court and stand on an equal footing." And this kind of introduction should be carried out in senior grades, not in junior grades. Everyone believed that it must be explained that: the fact that old professors introduce idealist philosophical ideas for teaching needs does not mean that the old professors themselves still insist on believing in this idea. Therefore, criticism of this idealist philosophical idea is not equal to criticism of the old professor's ideas. It is not surprising that the old professors may still have incorrect arguments in introducing or criticizing idealist philosophical ideas, or in introducing their research results on certain arguments of idealist philosophy, and others can also criticize these incorrect arguments. In this way, the truth will become clearer with debate; and if criticism becomes a habit, people's moods will only feel comfortable in criticism, not restrained.

The reform of the Department of Philosophy at Peking University is an inevitable result of the great victory of the socialist revolution in the economic sphere, and then the great victory in the political and ideological spheres. It is demanded by the students, demanded by the teachers, and demanded by the Party and the liberated people. Everyone believes that the direction of this reform is in line with the new education policy. However, the method of reform lacks experience, so everyone needs to give play to their creative spirit, learn together from major colleges and universities across the country, and learn together with the broad masses of the people, in order to explore a correct path.

    给哲学教学踏开一条新路
    关于北京大学哲学系教学改革的报告
    冯定
    今春以来，在全国各大、专学校一片教学改革声中，北京大学哲学系也出现了“教师按老样子再也教不下去，学生按老样子再也学不下去”的“革命情势”。于是大字报一张接着一张，大辩论一场接着一场，谁也不得不想，谁也不得不说，谁也不得不写，谁也不得不做了。
    初战
    辩论从要不要哲学系开始。
    全民思想大解放，哲学从虚无飘渺的幻境落到人间，人人都可谈哲学，事事都可谈哲学，广大的工农劳动者也都在学哲学，而且也都能懂哲学，那么像过去这样的哲学系，一年一年，一批一批，招收数十、数百既无政治经验又无生产经验的青年，啃几本书本，记几条教条，目的如何，效果如何，这是值得怀疑的。如果仅仅因为综合大学总得有个哲学系，是为了办哲学系而办哲学系，终究不是理由；所以过去这样的哲学系，究竟要不要，是应该大讨论而特讨论的。
    但是经过初战，这才知道，原来怀疑哲学系要不要的，并不是从上述这样论点出发，而是从其他的不同立场出发。首先，有人设立了“理论——实际——理论”这样一个公式；认为哲学终究是最高的抽象，最高的理论；因而必须出自理论，回到理论。他们说，假使哲学必须是理论结合实际的，必须遵从“实践——理论——实践”的公式，而只有懂得理论而又会结合实际的人才能称为哲学家，那么就将“哲学家”的称号奉送给在实践中结合理论的人好了，而在哲学系从事哲学教学的，哲学系所要培养的，就不妨谦虚些，称为“哲学工作者”好了。要么培养如此这般的哲学工作者，哲学系就要；否则哲学系就不要。
    初战的结果，扭转了论题。大家认为，哲学是关于自然、人类社会和思维的运动和发展的普遍规律的科学，既是世界观又是方法论，是来自实践、回到实践而承前启后的。当做学问，越是人人可谈，事事可谈，就越不可缺少。根据我国社会主义社会发展的趋向，哲学无疑是要成为全民的东西的。那时哲学的教学，是否仍要采取综合大学里设个哲学系这样的组织形式，是大可讨论的。甚至综合大学本身，从其产生的历史条件来看，当城市和乡村、工人和农民、体力劳动者和脑力劳动者的界限渐归泯灭，是否定要始终保持现在这样包罗万象的样子，无比的庞大，无比的集中，也是大可讨论的。但这些都远不是今天的事。今天，大学要普及，哲学系要普及，因而原有的大学和哲学系更不能不要，而是必须改革罢了。
    揭底
    初战表明了，不要哲学系，正是不要教学改革。也说明了要讨论的正是怎样改革的问题，而不是要不要的问题。论题的扭转，彼此的底子也就揭开了。原来，有不少人对教育为政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，是或多或少有抵触的。
    教育为政治服务这条原则，经过了多少次带有政治性的思想改造运动，至少在表面上，对谁都是很少异议的了。可是把教育与生产劳动相结合，学生参加劳动都列入正式课程，这对很多人来说是很难接受的。于是又引起了新的辩论高潮。
    不同意参加劳动的，并没有对教育结合生产劳动进行正面的、全面的攻讦，但提出不少论点来阻止这事的实行。其中最突出的就是“分工论”。此外还有“浪费论”、“质量降低论”等等，都是围绕“分工论”而引伸的。“分工论”者认为共产主义社会里也还有分工；“哲学工作者”的社会分工既是从事哲学，是钻研哲学著作，那就不应去从事简单的体力劳动。至少在过渡时期，这样的分工是完全必要的。
    经过辩论，绝大多数人都认为：拉扯在共产主义社会里还有分工是不对劲的。因为在共产主义社会里，人人从儿童时代开始，就是一面学习，一面劳动；首先都是有知识的生产劳动者，进而才有专业分工。而且每个人所掌握的专业也不限定只有一个，尽可有二个以至几个，至于体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工，是永远不会再有的了。甚至今天，亿万的工人农民一面努力生产，一面努力在学文化，学技术，学哲学，同时还争取在做“多面手”，“万能人”，既是工人，又是农民，既是劳动者，又是知识分子。实际上已经对准共产主义的方向了。拿同是有知识的劳动者还有专业分工，来混淆阶级社会里脑力劳动和体力劳动的不合理分工，这种“张冠李戴”的手法，是必须揭穿的。现在，虽然还有知识分子和工农分子的区别，但是这种现象事实上已开始在走向泯灭了。现在，具有丰富劳动经验的工农分子，已在向知识进军了。可是只有书本知识的知识分子，却还想借口分工，使“我这一代人”以至“我这一个人”，一辈子脱离实际，以便终身过老式知识分子的生活，那真是十足的悖时逆流，对己也是无益，更不必说对人和对社会主义建设了。其实，生产劳动是知识的源泉；学哲学，如果不是为了“与其谓之劳役，毋宁谓之娱乐”（康德语）而优游于悟性、理性之类“纯粹概念”的分析中，而是要真正懂得唯物论，真正懂得辩证法，并把它运用到实践中去，就必须而且应该首先和群众一起，投身于生产劳动的实践中。
    定案
    经过反复的辩论，原来不同意参加劳动的，特别是某些青年学生，绝大多数都转变了，至少是无人坚持旧的观点了。于是新教育计划大体定案。
    新教育计划贯彻了教育结合生产劳动的方针，将参加生产劳动列入正式的课程中。大家认为，参加劳动就是要使我们一面获得生产知识，一面体会群众感情。所以参加劳动的办法，不能光靠师生自办一些小规模的工厂，经管几亩农田；也不能仍以课堂为主，或为了给一章、一节的书本找些零散的例证，不时向工厂、农村去这么半天一日，或者稍微再长一些，像蜻蜓点水似的；而必须较长时间，比方一年，投身在广大的工农群众中，与之共同生活，共同学习，共同劳动；并且作一些有关农村和工厂的调查研究工作，这样来系统地了解一个合作社或者一个企业的生产过程。此外，我们既然是知识分子，那么除了主要是在劳动生产中向工农学习，来充实我们的知识以外，我们自然也该将已有的知识，去掉谬误和糟粕，设法和工农的实际结合起来，传播开去。不过这里决不能以“先生”自居，而必须仍在“学生”的地位，对原有的知识在实践中进行鉴别，以便知道哪些是该剔除的，哪些是该保留而给以充实和发扬的。我们也可以和工人、农民协作，为工人、农民写成哲学读本，边写边用边改；打破原来的体系，试以工厂、农村的生产程序为体系，把哲学基本知识的内容分别插入。我们既是工人、农民的学生，同时又应成为宣传者、组织者、受新教育培养而又实施新教育的人。
    最近考虑，全系学生，除旧生由部分教师带领，去农村一年，以便摸索一些既劳动又学习的经验外，一年级的全部新生也打算进入工厂一年，一面劳动，一面和工人一起大家学哲学；从结合政治和生产的实际中，学习哲学，能者为师，共同讨论，共同辩论，来获得哲学的基本知识。一年在工厂，半年回校总结经验，从事校内学习。再一年在农村，半年回校总结经验，从事校内学习。尚余二年，就以在校学习为主。不过在校学习时仍要划定若干时间，参加临时的、短期的劳动，或做些接触实际的调查研究工作。
    加深
    大家认为，哲学是男女老少都可学习的，而且迟早要成为全民的东西。但这并不妨碍哲学当做专门的学科而加深，成为某些人的专精业务。这说法是否又回到老哲学家的观点去了呢？完全不是。
    大家知道，普及和提高是对立的统一。普及和提高是在前进过程中永远相互转化的，没有普及为基础就没有提高。当全民都在劳动结合知识的时候，当全民都成为既是工农分子又是知识分子的时候，谁都可能而且必将在具有越来越丰富的基本知识的基础上，对于某一专门业务提高或加深；如像对白蚁、老鼠、稻子、麦子、红薯、玉米、化学、物理等等部门知识的提高或加深，其意义和价值，决不会比从事最概括的哲学知识的提高和加深，更低更少。所以我们并不反对提高和加深，但必须先成为有基本知识的普通劳动者，才能再向专门的业务前进。
    我们并不反对研究西方各国哲学史或其一派一家的学说。对于东方各国哲学史或其一派一家的学说也是如此。至于研究中国古代的各派各家学说，自不用说了。此外，像各种各样考据、训诂或其他资料工作，也是要做的。但是学哲学，最主要的是为了树立正确的立场、观点和方法，以便改造世界。所以，第一，决不能以此为权衡，说只有这样在研究、在整理资料等等的，才配称为哲学家或哲学工作者，而能够运用马克思主义哲学观点来总结和分析实际问题的就不配称为哲学家或哲学工作者。其次，这样在研究、在整理资料等等的，首先必须是联系生产、联系群众的人，而且随时随地仍在参加劳动和参加政治斗争的，是懂得用正确的观点和方法去做考据、训诂或其他资料工作的，否则就是完全脱离实际的书呆子了。第三，这样在研究、在整理资料等等的，分给极少数人去做，是必要的，但认为谁学哲学谁就得这样干，研究哲学史就集中最大力量搞古代的，近代的少，现代的更少，这里量的轻重是有质的意义的，是不对的。因此，大家认为，北大哲学系的学生，首先应成为有些哲学基本知识的社会主义劳动者，其次才是养成多少能够运用正确方法去分析社会主义社会的现实，毕业后可从事任何适宜的专职专业，但至少是能够做社会主义的思想教育工作，能够用广大劳动人民喜见乐闻的语言和例证，去在广大劳动人民中讲哲学。至于搞研究和整理工作的，决不是一般的培养目标。这些工作，应由研究生和大学毕业后从事哲学专业的人来担任。但只能是其中的极少数人，或者根本就是当做某些从事哲学专业的人的兼职罢了。
    争鸣
    哲学教学进行这样的改革，是并不妨碍“百花齐放、百家争鸣”政策的贯彻执行的。大家认为，广大劳动群众思想的解放，特别是他们在社会主义建设大跃进中所表现出来的丰富而新鲜的思想，必将使哲学大放异彩。但是正确的思想总是不断要同谬误的思想进行斗争的。因而学习哲学，同时必须对谬误的思想进行批判。对从事哲学专业的人来说，除了对迷信、对各色各样的落后思想进行批判外，还需要知道古往今来有些什么重要的唯心主义思想，充实批判的内容，这样学术论争也就更活跃起来了。
    北大有不少钻研过唯心主义哲学的老教授。所以为了树立哲学思想的对立面，活跃论争，开展批判，北大是有特殊良好的条件的。大家认为，这些老教授，既适宜于做编译工作，也适宜于做研究工作，同时仍可进行教学。现在，公开赞美唯心主义的是很少了，而且有些人已很想对自己旧的唯心主义哲学思想进行批判，但是对于唯心主义哲学的某些论点，是否就是完全不正确了，或者是否能够完全驳倒，可能还是有怀疑的。因此，大家认为，一方面，老教授如愿意对自己旧的唯心主义哲学思想进行批判，不妨和其他的人，包括学生在内，一起来进行批判。一方面，仍可给学生上课，介绍唯心主义哲学思想。或者除了一般的翻译研究工作以外，对自己认为不易驳倒的唯心主义哲学的某些论点也进行研究，以便将研究成果写成讲义发给学生。同时也可扼要对学生上课，允许大家辩论。这样，老教授仍可发挥专长，并可促进哲学辩论的活跃。不过大家认为，唯心主义哲学思想的介绍，其在教学中所占的分量，决不能超过马克思主义哲学在教学中所占的分量，也不能“分庭抗礼”。并且这种介绍应在高年级进行，而不应在低年级进行。大家认为必须说明的是：老教授为了教学需要，去介绍唯心主义哲学思想，并不等于老教授自己仍然坚持要信奉这种思想。因而对这种唯心主义哲学思想的批判，并不等于对老教授思想的批判。老教授在介绍或批判唯心主义哲学思想中，在介绍他们对唯心主义哲学某些论点的研究成果中，可能仍有不正确的论点是不足为奇的，因而别人还可对这些不正确的论点进行批判。这样，真理就会愈辩愈明；而批判如养成了习惯，则人们的心情在批判中是只会感觉舒畅而不会感觉局促的。
    北大哲学系的改革，是社会主义革命在经济上基本胜利之后而在政治上、思想上又获得伟大胜利的必然结果，是学生所要求的，是教员所要求的，也是党和解放了的人民所要求的。大家认为，这种改革的方针，是符合新的教育方针的。但是改革的办法，还缺乏经验，所以还需要大家发挥创造精神，向全国各地的大、专学校共同学习，和广大的人民共同学习，来摸索一条正确的道路。
