The main force on the iron smelting front displays their talents
Small Blast Furnaces Continuously Produce Champions
An Anhui earthen furnace improves its utilization coefficient to 0.245
Jiangsu takes high-yield furnaces as models to continuously set high iron production records
A small blast furnace in Shanxi achieves a daily pig iron output of fourteen and a half tons

According to the Anhui Daily, a 0.5 cubic meter small earthen furnace at the Zhongxing Iron Smelting Plant in Baofan Township, Wudian District, Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, produced 4,072 jin of pig iron on September 9th, equivalent to 2.036 tons, improving the furnace utilization coefficient to 0.245.

This small earthen furnace is divided into upper and lower sections, all made of mud mixed with rice straw, and uses wooden bellows for ventilation. The original daily output of this furnace was only about 900 to 1,200 jin. Starting in late August, the factory formed a technical research group, rebuilt the furnace, and improved the operation methods. First, they selected good iron sand and re-washed the iron sand that was collected. Then, they selected good charcoal and removed all the unburned charcoal. This ensured that the charcoal burned with a strong fire and the iron sand melted quickly. Second, they increased the air volume, added charcoal frequently and evenly, and increased the amount of iron sand, adding sand approximately every ten minutes. Due to the large amount of material added, strong airflow, and high heat, the molten iron flowed out quickly, and iron could be tapped two to three times per hour. As a result, the output increased rapidly. On September 6th, the daily output of pig iron reached 3,071 jin. From 9:00 PM on September 8th, a total of over 8,100 jin of iron sand and 7,800 jin of charcoal were added within 24 hours, and by the evening of September 9th, 4,072 jin of iron were produced.

In addition, a 1.5 cubic meter earthen blast furnace at the Xin Sheng Iron Factory in Hefei City, Anhui Province, has a daily pig iron output of 3.33 tons, with a utilization coefficient improved to 0.45.

On September 3rd, the first day this earthen blast furnace was officially put into production, the daily pig iron output reached 3.33 tons. In the following days of continuous production, the daily output remained around 3 tons.

People's Daily, Nanjing, September 18th (Reporter Zhang Jing) reports: Taking high-yield furnaces as models, quickly applying relatively reasonable and scientific technical operating experience to guide and transform low-yield furnaces, and expanding iron production results is an important measure recently taken by various parts of Jiangsu in the struggle to achieve large-scale high yield in steel.

From September 7th to 9th, the large and small earthen blast furnaces in the seven cities of Yangzhou, Changzhou, and Wuxi successively launched four high-yield "satellites." The employees of the Guazhou Iron and Steel Plant in Yangzhou City, who once initiated a province-wide high-yield steel production competition, have carried out a series of technical reforms on earthen furnaces in recent days. The No. 8 furnace in the second workshop, with a volume of only 0.18 cubic meters, produced 1,113 jin of iron in 26 hours from 1:00 PM on the 8th to 3:00 PM the next day, with a daily output of 1,027 jin, translating to a utilization coefficient of 0.349, breaking the new national earthen furnace utilization coefficient record created by the Suzhou Minfeng Factory. A 0.36 cubic meter Chinese-style earthen furnace at the Changzhou Jiufeng Dyeing Factory created a high-yield record of 1,441.5 jin of iron produced in 24 hours on the 7th, about twice the output of similar furnaces. The 2.5 cubic meter earthen blast furnace at the Wuxi Red Flag Iron and Steel Plant had a daily output as high as 7,900 jin, just 100 jin short of the 4-ton mark. This high output far exceeds the designed utilization coefficient of the furnace.

The main reasons for the high yield of these furnaces are that they boldly improved the furnace body structure, expanded the hearth, and increased the amount of molten iron. At the same time, they made a series of reforms in operating techniques such as ore selection, furnace opening, material addition, and iron tapping, shortening the iron tapping time.

The local Party committees promptly summarized the reasonable and scientific aspects of these experiences and carried out technical reforms on a large number of earthen furnaces, causing the daily output of the originally low-yield furnaces to rise rapidly. Changzhou City used the "Chinese-style" and "Dingtai-style" furnaces as models to carry out technical reforms in ninety-three earthen furnace groups, greatly leveraging the potential of the earthen furnaces, and some furnaces even created higher records. Wuxi City compiled the experience of the earthen furnace with the highest iron output into a book and widely disseminated it, which had a great effect. On the 15th, the city's daily iron output had risen to 170.85 tons.

This newspaper reports that a small blast furnace with a volume of 5.9 cubic meters at the Yangquan Power Machinery Factory in Shanxi Province produced 14.6 tons of standard pig iron on September 14th, with a utilization coefficient reaching 0.404 cubic meters. In order to let the small blast furnace fly a red flag and produce more iron, the factory's employees braved the high temperatures to rush to repair the hot blast stove, bringing the wind temperature to 540 degrees Celsius. They also flexibly grasped the material loading method and coke load according to the furnace temperature changes, shortening the loading time to about five minutes per load, which greatly increased the output.

    炼铁战线上主力军各显神通
    小高炉连出状元
    安徽一土炉利用系数改善到0.245
    江苏以丰产炉为样版连创出铁高产纪录
    山西一座小高炉生铁日产量达十四吨半
    据安徽日报消息 安徽省金寨县吴店区包畈乡中兴炼铁厂一座零点五立方公尺的小土炉，9月9日日产生铁四千零七十二斤，合二点零三六吨，高炉利用系数改善到零点二四五。
    这座小土炉分上下两节，全部是用泥土掺和稻草制成的，用木制风箱拉风。这座炉原来的日产量只有九百斤到一千二百斤左右。从8月下旬开始，这个工厂组成一个技术研究小组，重新改建了炉子，在操作方法上，首先选好铁砂，把收进来的铁砂再淘一次，然后选用好的木炭，把没有烧好的炭全部去掉。这样，烧炭火力强，铁砂熔化快。其次，增强风量，上炭上勤上匀，增加铁砂量，每十分钟左右上一次砂。由于上料多、风力大、火力强，铁水流出的很快，每小时可以出铁两次到三次。因此，产量迅速上升。9月6日，就日产生铁三千零七十一斤。从8日下午九时起，一昼夜共上铁砂八千一百多斤、木炭七千八百多斤，到9日晚，出铁四千零七十二斤。
    又讯　安徽省合肥市新生铁工厂一座一点五立方公尺的土高炉，日产生铁三点三三吨，利用系数已改善到零点四五。
    9月3日，这座土高炉正式投入生产的第一天，生铁日产量便达到三点三三吨，以后继续生产的几天当中，日产量也都在三吨左右。
    本报南京18日电　记者张竞报道：以丰产炉为样版，尽快运用比较合理和科学的技术操作经验，指导和改造低产炉，扩大出铁战果，这是最近江苏各地在争取钢铁大面积丰产斗争中的一项重要措施。
    9月7日到9日，扬州、常州、无锡七个市的大小土高炉，接连放了四个高产卫星。曾经向全省倡议开展钢铁高额丰产竞赛的扬州市瓜洲钢铁厂职工，连日在土炉上作了一系列的技术改革，第二车间的一只只零点一八立方公尺的八号炉，从8日下午一时生火到次日下午三时，二十六小时内，出铁达一千一百一十三斤，日产量达一千零二十七斤，折合利用系数为零点三四九，突破了苏州民丰厂所创造的全国土炉利用系数的新纪录。常州市九丰染厂一个零点三六立方公尺的中华式土炉，在7日创造了一昼夜出铁一千四百四十一斤半的高产纪录，比同类型的炉子出铁量高一倍左右。无锡市红旗钢铁厂二点五立方公尺的土高炉，日产量竟高达七千九百斤，差一百斤就进了四吨大关，产量之高，远远超过了这个炉子设计的利用系数。
    这些炉子之所以能够高产，主要的原因是他们大胆地改进了炉身结构，扩大了炉膛，增加了熔铁量，同时在选矿、开炉、加料、出铁等操作技术上作了一系列的改革，缩短了出铁时间。
    各地党委及时总结了这些经验中合理的科学的部分，在大片土炉子上进行了技术改革，使原来低产的炉子日产量迅速上升。常州市以“中华式”和“鼎泰式”两种炉子为样版，在九十三个土炉群中进行技术改革，大大发挥了土炉的潜力，有些炉子还创造了更高的纪录。无锡市把出铁最多的土炉的经验编写成书，广泛传播，作用很大。15日全市铁的日产量已升到一百七十点八五吨。
    本报讯　山西省阳泉动力机械厂一座容积为五点九立方公尺的小高炉9月14日日产标准生铁十四点六吨，利用系数达到零点四零四立方公尺。为了让小高炉插红旗、多出铁，这个工厂的职工冒着高温抢修热风洞，使风温达到五百四十度，并根据炉温变化，灵活地掌握装料方法和焦炭负荷，使装料时间缩短为五分钟左右一次，因而大大增加了产量。
