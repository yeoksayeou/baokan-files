    A artillery company, under the hazy moonlight, arrived at a forward position somewhere on the Fujian Front. As soon as the trucks stopped, twenty or thirty young people swarmed around, including many women. The soldiers were stunned: Who was waiting for us on the road in the middle of the night?
    At that moment, a young man in his twenties walked out of the crowd. He introduced himself to the company's political instructor, Xiao Enming, as Kang Shi, the local militia platoon leader. These young men and women were members of the "July 1st" agricultural cooperative, who were persisting in production and also fighting as militia on the front line, braving enemy fire. They had heard that an artillery unit was coming tonight and had been waiting by the road for a long time to help the troops settle in.
    With the help of the cooperative members, the soldiers quickly set up the cannons and arranged their accommodation. From then on, the soldiers lived and fought alongside the cooperative members on the same front line.
    The previous artillery unit stationed here had already established a close friendship with the cooperative members. To prevent the cooperative members from being injured or killed in the Chiang bandit army's shelling, the soldiers gave up one of their shelters for the villagers to live in. The cooperative members usually helped the troops wash clothes, stand guard, and build fortifications, and during battles, they helped carry shells, doing everything they could. When the new troops arrived, militia leader Kang Shi and the cooperative members again asked the instructor for tasks. The instructor, seeing that everyone was busy with production, tried to decline. However, the enthusiastic people supporting the front line insisted.
    One evening, the cooperative members finally received the task of helping the troops load and unload a batch of supplies overnight. The cooperative members were overjoyed, but there were more people than tasks. Who should go? The dozen or so cooperative members at home started an argument: one said he was young, another said he was healthy, and the women also insisted on going. In the end, it was decided that fourteen men and women cooperative members would go, divided into two shifts, working alternately in the first and second halves of the night. Cai Yongtai, who was not in good physical condition, was initially not assigned a task, but after repeatedly requesting the captain, he also worked with everyone for half the night. The cooperative members also came up with various ways to support the army. One afternoon, more than ten cooperative members dug up a large pile of sweet potatoes from the fields and sat around a large tree peeling them. The company's quartermaster saw that the cooperative members couldn't possibly eat so many and became suspicious, but the cooperative members insisted that they were for themselves. In the middle of the night, the cooperative members carried buckets of steaming sweet potato soup to each squad. It turned out that they had secretly cooked a lot of sweet potato soup to慰劳 the soldiers who were still working at night. This caused a heated dispute on the positions of each squad, with the soldiers refusing to eat it, and the cooperative members insisting that the soldiers accept it. Finally, the instructor decided to accept the sweet potato soup, give the cooperative members grain coupons as compensation, and ask them not to do this again in the future. But the next night, the cooperative members brought the steaming sweet potato soup again, with two pounds of brown sugar added. On the third day, the instructor came up with a solution: to have the kitchen control the marching pot, so that the cooperative members had no place to cook, thus stopping the matter. Later, the cooperative members sent a large basket of longan to the troops, dumping them on the position and leaving, forcing the troops to accept them.
    The people love the soldiers, and the soldiers love the people. After arriving at the position, the soldiers lived in very crowded conditions, even having to take turns sleeping, but they resolutely gave up a shelter for the cooperative members to sleep in, so that the cooperative members would not be injured or killed by enemy shelling. They also promptly informed the cooperative members of the enemy's situation, asking everyone to do a good job in air defense and artillery defense. During a battle, an enemy shell hit near the shelter where the cooperative members lived. The deputy battalion commander, Sun Fengchi, and the company's political instructor immediately braved the artillery fire to visit everyone. Because the cooperative members could not cook due to the enemy shelling, the soldiers sent their own hot meals to the cooperative members' shelter, insisting that they eat.
    Such touching examples of the army loving the people and the people loving the army can be seen everywhere on the entire Fujian Front.

    在前沿阵地上
    新华社记者　陈希明
    一支炮兵连队在朦胧的月色中，来到了福建前线某地的一个前沿阵地。汽车刚一停下，就有二、三十个年轻人蜂涌而来，其中还有不少妇女。战士们都楞住了：在这深更半夜，是谁在公路上等候我们？
    这时，人群里走出来一个二十多岁的青年，他向连指导员萧恩明介绍，他是这里的民兵分队长康士，这些青年男女是冒着敌人炮火在前沿坚持生产的“七一”农业社的社员，也是在前沿坚持斗争的民兵。他们听说今晚有一支炮兵部队要来，很早就到公路边来等着帮助部队安家。
    战士们在社员们的帮助下，迅速安顿好大炮，接着又安排好了住处。从此，战士们就和社员们生活、战斗在一个阵地上。
    原先驻在这里的一支炮兵部队，已经和社员们建立了亲密的友谊。战士们为了不使社员们在蒋贼军炮击时遭受伤亡，让出了自己的一个掩蔽部给老乡们住。社员们平时帮助部队洗衣服、站岗放哨、筑工事，战时帮助扛炮弹，什么都干。新的部队来了，民兵队长康士和社员们又去向指导员要求任务，指导员看到大家生产很忙，尽量推谢。但是，热情支援前线的人民却说什么也不行，再三地要求任务。
    一天傍晚，社员们终于接到了连夜帮助部队装卸一批物资的任务。社员们可乐开了，但是人多事少，应该谁去？在家的十多个社员引起了一场争论：这个说自己年轻，那个说自己身体好，妇女也坚持要去。最后决定去十四个男女社员，分成两班，上、下半夜轮流干。身体比较差的蔡永泰起先没有分配到任务，他再三向队长提出要求后，也和大家一起干了半夜。社员们还想了各种办法来支援军队。一天下午，十多个社员从地里挖了一大堆地瓜，围坐在大树下削皮。连里的事务长看到社员们不可能吃这么多，就怀疑起来，但是社员们一口咬定是自己吃的。到了半夜，社员们提着一桶桶热腾腾的地瓜汤到了各班，原来他们瞒着部队烧了许多地瓜汤，来慰劳晚间还在工作的战士们。在各个班的阵地上引起了一场热烈的争执，战士们说什么也不肯吃，社员们坚持要战士们收下。最后指导员决定收下这些地瓜汤，补给社员们粮票，并且要求社员们以后不再这样。但第二天晚上，社员们又把热腾腾的地瓜汤送来了，里面还放了两斤红糖。第三天，指导员想出了办法：要伙房控制行军锅，使社员们没有地方煮，才把这件事制止下来。后来，社员们又给部队送来了一大筐龙眼，他们把龙眼倒在阵地上就走，使部队不能不收下来。
    人民热爱战士，战士也热爱人民。战士们来到阵地后住得非常挤，甚至要轮流着睡觉，但是他们坚决让出一个掩蔽部给社员们睡，使社员们在敌人的炮火轰击下不致受到伤亡。他们还把敌情及时告诉社员们，要大家做好防空、防炮工作。在一次炮战中，有一发敌人的炮弹打在社员们住的掩蔽部附近，副营长孙凤池和连指导员立即冒着炮火来探望大家。社员们因为敌人炮击没法烧饭，战士们就把自己热气腾腾的饭菜送到社员们的掩蔽部里，一定要社员们吃。
    这种军队热爱人民、人民热爱军队的感人事例，在整个福建前线，到处可见。
