Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 7th: According to the Yugoslav News Agency, "Borba" said today in its commentary on the situation in Kinmen and Matsu: Kinmen and Matsu are Chinese islands, just as "Formosa and the Pescadores Islands" (Note: referring to Taiwan and the Penghu Islands) are Chinese islands. Of course, these territories are not yet under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government, but this does not change the nature of the issue: this is and remains a purely Chinese internal affair. The newspaper said that if there is a threat to peace in the Far East, it lies mainly in the assumption of two Chinas, which in fact ultimately boils down to not recognizing China and the irresponsible and unrealistic idea of ​​conducting counter-revolution in that country.
    "Borba" pointed out the seriousness of the situation. It concluded that the greatest enemy of peace in this region is Chiang Kai-shek, who advocates creating tension. The newspaper added that the main danger is not Kinmen and Matsu, or even "Formosa", but external interference in this purely Chinese internal affair.

    南“战斗报”评金马局势说
　　主要危险是外界干涉中国内政
    新华社7日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德讯：“战斗报”今天在评论金门和马祖局势时说：金门和马祖是中国的岛屿，正像“福摩萨和佩斯卡多尔群岛”（按：指台湾和澎湖列岛）是中国的岛屿一样。当然，这些领土还没有处于中国政府的管辖之下，但是这并不改变这一问题的性质：这是而且仍旧是中国纯粹的内政问题。这家报纸说，如果远东存在着对和平的威胁的话，那主要在于关于两个中国的假定，这种假定实际上归根结蒂是不承认中国和在那个国家进行反革命这种不负责任的和不现实的想法。
    “战斗报”指出局势的严重性，它最后说，这一地区的和平的最大敌人是蒋介石，他主张制造紧张局势。这家报纸又说，主要的危险不是金门和马祖，甚至不是“福摩萨”，而是外界对于这个纯粹的中国内政的干涉。
