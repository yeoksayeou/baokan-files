　　Pen and Reality
    —Letter from Elder Guo
　　Comrade Editor:
    I arrived in Changchun on August 31st and participated in the celebration of the successful trial production of the eight major precision instruments. I will be leaving here for Beijing soon.
    Reading the newspaper, I saw that the yield of early rice in Macheng has exceeded that of Fanchang. One section of the "Soaring on a Rocket" poem I sent earlier needs to be completely revised.
    “Early rice was just said to be thirty-six thousand,
    Middle rice is now rumored to be forty-three thousand.
    Fanchang deserves its name of Fanchang,
    Closely chasing Macheng County." Please change it to
    “Macheng’s middle rice is fifty-two thousand,
    Exceeding Fanchang's forty-three thousand.
    The waves of the Yangtze push the front waves,
    Astonishing yields are successively reported.”
    This truly proves: my pen cannot keep up with the speed of production.
    If the poem has already been published, could you please publish this letter as a correction. Also, please change the line about steel production of ten million to "ten million plus."
              Guo Moruo
        September 4, 1958, in Changchun

　　笔和现实
    —郭老来信
　　编辑同志：
    我是8月31日来长春的，参加了精密仪器八大件试制成功庆祝大会，不日当离此回京。
    阅报见麻城早稻产量已超过繁昌，前寄上的“跨上火箭篇”中有一节须要全改。
    “早稻才闻三万六，
    中稻又传四万三。
    繁昌不愧号繁昌，
    紧紧追赶麻城县。”请改为
    “麻城中稻五万二，
    超过繁昌四万三。
    长江后浪推前浪，
    惊人产量次第传。”
    这确实证明：我的笔是赶不上生产的速度。
    该诗如已发表，可否请将此信刊出以代更正。又钢铁产量千万二句，请改为“千万另”。
              郭沫若
        1958年9月4日于长春
