Calling this editorial note an "Explanation of the Topic" means providing an annotation for the news headline.

Some people say that the way the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant built its steelmaking workshop in fourteen days has some "guerrilla habits," intending to "denigrate" it. Now we are going to write a reversal article, changing "denigration" into "praise."

What is the "guerrilla habit" that some people "denigrate"? It is the leadership style where leaders and the masses are of one heart, sharing joys and hardships, going to the front lines together, and doing what they say. In fact, this style is very good. This is a genuine, well-tested Marxist-Leninist leadership style, and it is our Party's "family heirloom." During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, it was precisely because our Party, from top to bottom, earnestly implemented this leadership style that we were able to defeat powerful domestic and foreign enemies and win national victory under extremely difficult material conditions. On the industrial production and construction front, our Party committee secretaries and factory directors eat, live, and labor alongside the masses, and production and construction advance by leaps and bounds as if they have wings. Therefore, no matter when or in what work department, we should not abandon this old tradition, but should continue to promote and carry it forward.

    题解
    编后而名之曰“题解”，意思是给这条新闻的标题作个注解。
    有人说石景山钢铁厂用十四天建成炼钢车间的做法有些“游击习气”，意在“贬”。现在我们来写翻案文章，变“贬”为“褒”。
    有些人所“贬”的“游击习气”是什么呢？就是领导和群众一条心，同甘共苦，一起上前线，说干就干的领导作风。其实这种作风好得很。这是地地道道的经过千锤百炼的马克思列宁主义的领导作风，是我们党的“传家宝”。在抗日战争、解放战争时期，正是由于我们的党从上到下认真地贯彻这种领导作风，才能在物质条件极端困难的条件下，打败了强大的国内外敌人，夺得了全国的胜利。在工业生产和建设战线，我们的党委书记、厂长和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，生产和建设就像长了翅膀一样，飞跃前进。因此，无论什么时候，无论什么工作部门，都不应丢掉这种老传统，而应该继续发扬光大。
