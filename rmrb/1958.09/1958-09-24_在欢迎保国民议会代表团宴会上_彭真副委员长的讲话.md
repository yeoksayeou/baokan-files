Speech by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen at the Banquet Welcoming the Bulgarian National Assembly Delegation
Dear Comrade Chervenkov, dear Comrade Kostov, dear comrades of the entire delegation, comrades, friends:

Tonight, we are very happy to gather here with the comrades of the Bulgarian National Assembly Delegation and the Sofia City People's Council Delegation like family. On behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, and the Chinese people, I extend to you a warm welcome and heartfelt respect.

The Bulgarian people, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, overthrew the reactionary rule after a long, arduous, and heroic struggle, established a people's democratic regime, and then carried out socialist construction with creative and selfless labor, transforming Bulgaria from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial and agricultural country. Now, the Bulgarian people are fighting with full confidence to realize the Third Five-Year Plan for further developing the national economy. The cause of the socialist Bulgarian people is also our cause. We are very happy for your achievements and sincerely congratulate the fraternal Bulgarian people on achieving new and more brilliant achievements in socialist construction.

The Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian people have always been faithful to the great principles of proletarian internationalism, actively striving to strengthen the unity and cooperation among socialist countries, defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and wage a resolute struggle against modern revisionism represented by the Tito group in Yugoslavia. In international affairs, Bulgaria has consistently sympathized with and supported the struggles of the peoples of Asian, African, and Latin American countries against colonialism and for national independence, and has made tremendous efforts to ease international tensions and safeguard peace in Europe and the world. This effort by the Bulgarian people has made an important contribution to consolidating the militant unity of the international communist movement and safeguarding the cause of world peace.

The people of China and Bulgaria have always had a deep fraternal friendship. The friendship between our two peoples is based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, and the friendship between our two peoples is eternal and unbreakable. When I and our delegation of the National People's Congress, and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, visited Bulgaria last year, we were warmly received by the fraternal Bulgarian people and the leading comrades of the Party and state everywhere, which made us deeply appreciate the depth of this friendship. We are proud to have such loyal friends as the Bulgarian people, and at the same time, we once again express our deep gratitude to the Bulgarian people and the leading comrades of the Party and state for the warm hospitality they extended to us during our visit to Bulgaria.

The Chinese people have suffered deeply from imperialist aggression and waged outstanding struggles against imperialist aggression before achieving revolutionary victory and establishing our state led by the working class. However, American imperialism, which has increasingly blatantly inherited Hitler's mantle of attempting to dominate the world, still occupies China's territory of Taiwan as a forward base for launching attacks on the Chinese mainland. Recently, it has also deployed troops and generals in the Taiwan Strait region to intensify its military provocations and war threats against China, endangering and undermining peace in the Far East and the world.

Comrades know that the Chinese people love peace. However, if American imperialism insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, then our united 600 million people will concentrate all their strength to give the aggressors a crushing blow. The Chinese people's determination and confidence to liberate their territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are unshakable, and their determination and confidence to defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity are unshakable. No war provocation by the United States will intimidate the Chinese people. Our struggle is just, and we are confident that with the support of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, and other fraternal countries, and with the sympathy and support of all peace-loving countries and peoples in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world, we will surely achieve a complete victory. The American imperialists will one day realize from their own experience that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is invincible. The united anti-aggression struggle of all peace-loving countries and peoples is invincible.

Dear Comrade Chervenkov, Comrade Kostov, and all comrades of the delegation, we sincerely hope that you will visit more places, see more things, and give us criticism and guidance on the shortcomings in our work during your visit to our country. We firmly believe that your visit will further develop and consolidate the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the people of China and Bulgaria.

Comrades, friends, I propose:

    For the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Bulgaria,
    For the prosperity and strength of Bulgaria,
    For world peace,
    For the health of Comrade Chervenkov, Comrade Kostov, and all comrades of the two delegations,
    For the health of Comrades Zhivkov, Damyanov, and Yugov,
    Cheers!

    在欢迎保国民议会代表团宴会上
    彭真副委员长的讲话亲爱的契尔文科夫同志，亲爱的科斯托夫同志，亲爱的代表团全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    今天晚上，我们同保加利亚国民议会代表团和索非亚市人民会议代表团的全体同志们像家人一样欢聚一堂，感到非常高兴。我谨代表中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会、北京市人民委员会和中国人民，向你们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。
    具有光荣革命传统的保加利亚人民，在保加利亚共产党的领导下，经过长期的艰苦的英勇斗争，推翻了反动统治，建立了人民民主政权，接着以创造性的忘我劳动进行了社会主义建设，把保加利亚从一个落后的农业国发展成为先进的社会主义工农业国家。现在，保加利亚人民正在信心百倍地为实现进一步发展国民经济的第三个五年计划而斗争。社会主义的保加利亚人民的事业，同时就是我们的事业，我们为你们的成就感到十分高兴，衷心地祝贺兄弟的保加利亚人民在社会主义建设事业中获得新的更辉煌的成就。
    保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民一贯地忠实于无产阶级国际主义的伟大原则，积极努力加强社会主义各国间的团结合作，捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，同以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义进行了坚决的斗争。在国际事务中，保加利亚一贯地同情和支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争，为缓和国际紧张局势、维护欧洲和世界的和平进行了巨大的努力。保加利亚人民的这种努力，对巩固国际共产主义运动的战斗团结和维护世界和平的事业作出了重要的贡献。
    中保两国人民一向有着深厚的兄弟友谊，我们两国人民间的友谊是建立在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上的，我们两国人民间的友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的。我和我们的全国人民代表大会代表团，和北京市人民委员会代表团，去年访问保加利亚的时候，到处受到了兄弟的保加利亚人民和党和国家的领导同志们的热烈的接待，使我们深切地体会到这种友谊的深厚。我们以有保加利亚人民这样忠诚的朋友感到自豪，同时也在此再一次对保加利亚人民和党和国家的领导同志们在我们访问保加利亚时所给予的热诚款待表示深切的感谢。
    中国人民曾经饱受过帝国主义的侵略，同帝国主义的侵略进行了卓越的斗争，才取得了革命的胜利，建立起我们的工人阶级领导的国家。可是，已经日益明目张胆地继承了希特勒妄图独霸全球的衣钵的美帝国主义，却仍然霸占着中国的领土台湾，作为它向中国大陆发动进攻的前进基地，最近，并且在台湾海峡地区调兵遣将，加紧对中国的军事挑衅和战争威胁，危害和破坏远东和世界的和平。
    同志们知道，中国人民是热爱和平的，但是，如果美帝国主义硬要把战争强加在中国人民的头上，那么，我们团结一致的六亿人民必将集中一切力量，给侵略者以粉碎的打击。中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和澎湖列岛的决心和信心是不可动摇的，保卫我国的主权和领土完整的决心和信心是不可动摇的。美国的任何战争挑衅都不会吓倒中国人民。我们的斗争是正义的，我们确信中国人民在苏联、保加利亚和其他兄弟国家的支援下，在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的同情支持下，我们一定能够取得彻底的胜利。美帝国主义者终有一天会从自己的体验中认识以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国是不可战胜的。一切爱好和平的国家和人民团结一致的反侵略的斗争是不可战胜的。
    亲爱的契尔文科夫同志、科斯托夫同志和代表团的全体同志们，我们衷心希望你们在我国访问期间多到一些地方、多看一些东西，并且对我们工作中的缺点给予批评和指教。我们深信，你们这次的访问，将进一步发展和巩固中保两国人民的兄弟友谊和合作。
    同志们，朋友们，我提议：
    为中保两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊，
    为保加利亚的富强繁荣，
    为世界和平，
    为契尔文科夫同志、科斯托夫同志和两个代表团的全体同志们的健康，
    为日夫科夫同志、达米扬诺夫同志、于哥夫同志的健康，
    干杯！
