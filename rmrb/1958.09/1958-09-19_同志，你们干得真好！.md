    Comrades, you've done a great job!
    Dear Comrades of the entire Fujian Front:
    Whenever we are quietly listening to lectures in classrooms, happily working in factories, or reading in the newspapers about the flowing steel across the country, the high-yield grain "satellites" rising into the sky one after another, and the people's communes being rapidly established in rural areas throughout the country, we also think of the fact that all of this is possible because you are diligently guarding the coastal gateway of the motherland day and night. Currently, American imperialism is creating tension in the Taiwan Strait, disregarding the repeated warnings of our government, and continuously carrying out military provocations against our country, infringing upon our territorial waters and airspace. Therefore, your responsibility is even greater and more glorious. At the same time, you have also proven with your actions that you are worthy of this glorious responsibility. You have already given the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops the punishment they deserve: shooting down their aircraft and destroying their warships. The roar of your artillery represents the will of 600 million people of the motherland. Comrades, you've done a great job! We warmly congratulate you on making even greater contributions in the struggle to liberate Taiwan and defend the motherland! We extend our heartfelt respect to you!
    The shameless provocations of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have aroused our unparalleled anger. We are determined to transform anger into strength, be prepared at all times, await the call of the motherland, and go to the forefront of the liberation of Taiwan. We cannot tolerate American imperialism continuing to infringe upon our territory and occupy our Taiwan. We cannot tolerate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits continuing to run rampant there, harming our compatriots and harming our classmates. At present, our classmates are organizing and conducting military training under the Party's call for "all-out militarization" and "organizational militarization, combat operationalization, and collective living." Our school has established a special forces combat division, and all the students in our class have joined the militia and formed a combat platoon. We are now actively participating in labor to speed up the construction of factories and intensifying military training. We are determined to train ourselves into soldiers like you. As long as the motherland gives the order, we can immediately put down our pens and pick up our guns, go to the front line with you, and fight together to defend the socialist motherland and liberate Taiwan.
    Dear Comrades, let us work together in different places and in different positions to fight for the liberation of Taiwan and the defense of the motherland!

    同志，你们干得真好！
    亲爱的福建前线全体将士们：
    每当我们在课堂上安静地听课，在工厂里愉快地劳动的时候，每当我们在报上看到全国遍地钢水奔流，粮食高产的卫星一个一个地升上天，人民公社在全国农村迅速地建立起来的时候，我们同时也就想到：所有这一切，都是由于你们日日夜夜辛勤地守卫着祖国沿海的大门，才能得到的。目前美帝国主义正在台湾海峡制造紧张局势，不顾我国政府再三再四的警告，接连对我国进行军事挑衅，侵犯我们祖国的领海领空，因此你们的责任就更加重大和光荣。同时，你们也以自己的行动，证明了你们是无愧于这个光荣职责的。你们已经给了蒋贼军应有的惩罚：打下了他们的飞机，击毁了他们的军舰。你们的大炮吼声，代表着六亿祖国人民的意志。同志们，你们干得真好！我们热烈地祝贺你们在解放台湾、保卫祖国的斗争中，立下更大的功勋！我们向你们致以衷心的敬意！
    美帝国主义和蒋贼的无耻挑衅，激起了我们无比的愤怒。我们决心化愤怒为力量，时刻准备着，等待祖国的召唤，走上解放台湾的最前线。我们不能容忍美帝国主义继续侵犯我国的领土，霸占我国的台湾。我们不能容忍蒋贼继续在那里胡作非为，伤害我们的同胞，伤害我们的同学。目前，我们同学正在党的“全民军事化”和“组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化”的号召下，组织起来进行军事训练。我们学校已经成立了一个特种兵战斗师，我们班的全体同学都参加了民兵，成立了一个战斗排。我们现在一方面积极参加劳动，加紧建设工厂，另一方面加紧进行军事训练。我们决心把自己锻炼成和你们一样的战士，只要祖国一声召唤，我们就能马上放下笔杆，拿起枪杆，到前线去和你们一起，为保卫社会主义祖国，为解放台湾而战。
    亲爱的同志们，让我们一起在不同的地方和不同的岗位上，为解放台湾，保卫祖国而斗争吧！
