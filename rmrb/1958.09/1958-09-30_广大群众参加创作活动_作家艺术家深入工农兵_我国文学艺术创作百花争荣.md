Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Over the past year, the mass literary and artistic creation of workers, peasants, and soldiers has flourished as never before. Communist literature and art are budding and thriving in this mass creative movement. The orientation of literature and art serving politics and production, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, has also achieved a decisive victory through the development of the current mass literary and artistic creation movement.

Since last winter and this spring, workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country have used various literary and artistic forms, such as poetry, clapper talk, prose, scripts, novels, ballads, fine arts, and music, to reflect their new lives and past struggles. The number of works is in the hundreds of millions. In Jiangsu alone, nearly ten million pieces have been created by the masses in the past six months. Throughout the country, many "everyone is a poet, poetry is for everyone to appreciate" poetry villages, poetry counties, and poetry factories have emerged. The emergence of mural counties like Changli and Shulu in Hebei and Pizhou in Jiangsu reflects the unprecedented scale of mass art creation activities since the Great Leap Forward. Mass song creation activities have also formed a craze. In production and labor, the masses "do what they do, sing what they sing; do what they do, write what they write; do it themselves, write it themselves, sing it themselves." For example, in Siji Township, Chaoxian County, Anhui, everyone, male and female, young and old, is a singer. Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have created thousands of poems, novels, scripts, memoirs of revolutionary struggles, as well as music and art works. In this mass literary and artistic creation movement, all creations are closely coordinated with production and political tasks, inspiring the revolutionary drive and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses, promoting production and educating the people, and truly giving full play to the role of literature and art as a tool for the Party's propaganda and education.

Over the past year, the creations of workers, peasants, and soldiers have not only been astounding in quantity, but also have produced many excellent works with high ideological content and relatively perfect artistic skills. For example, the widely popular poem "I Have Come" reflects the heroic spirit of the working people in conquering nature and is an example of the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. The peasant poet Wang Lao Jiu's "Three Poor Peasants" uses only a few words to express the development prospects of the cooperative and the Party's deep concern for the masses. Among the works of the officers and soldiers, such as the poem "Private" written by a soldier, depicts the pride of revolutionary soldiers with vivid images; and the poem by workers of Shanghai State Cotton Mill No. 19 aspiring to surpass Li Bai's heroic spirit, fully demonstrates that poetry is a by-product of labor. These excellent works from the workers, peasants, and soldiers now occupy a major position in national literary and artistic publications.

Today, the Great Leap Forward in mass literary and artistic creation is a mass movement of hundreds of millions of people. Therefore, this movement is also a sign of the great popularization of communist literature and art and an important part of the cultural revolution. The connection between the working people and literature and art has established a foundation for the combination of physical and mental labor, indicating the direction of the development of communist literature and art.

The flourishing of mass literary and artistic creation has not only produced thousands of outstanding worker-peasant-soldier authors, and a proletarian literary and artistic creation force is gradually taking shape, but also has played a role in spurring and promoting the professional literary and artistic teams.

The vigorous mass literary and artistic creation movement was launched under the direct advocacy of the Party. The Party Central Committee, as well as the Party committees of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, attach great importance to the development of this movement. Since April, Party committees at all levels have not only issued instructions and notices on collecting folk songs, but have also established institutions for collecting and compiling folk songs under the direct leadership of the Party committees. Many leading Party and government comrades not only attach importance to this movement, but are also direct participants in it. This mass literary and artistic creation movement eloquently shows that our Party can not only lead literature and art but also understands literature and art best.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Over the past year, China's literary and artistic creation has presented an unprecedented scene of a hundred flowers blooming.

According to incomplete statistics from five national literary and artistic book publishing houses in Beijing, from January to the end of September this year, nearly three hundred newly created literary and artistic works of various forms have been published, totaling more than sixteen million copies. Compared with last year, the number of categories has increased by nearly half, and the number of copies has increased by more than three times. In the first half of this year, a total of more than seventy million copies of literary books were sent to the vast number of readers across the country, which is more than double the number in the same period last year.

The prosperity of China's literary and artistic creation this year is not only reflected in the huge increase in quantity but also more prominently in the improvement of the ideological and artistic level of the works. Taking literary works as an example, long and short stories, poems, memoirs, and biographies that express the spirit of revolutionary heroism of the people and revolutionary historical facts account for a large proportion, and they have aroused widespread and profound influence among readers. Features and reportage that quickly reflect the current political struggles and new people and new things in the Great Leap Forward are also loved by readers. A noteworthy new situation is that over the past year, the readership of literary and artistic books has been rapidly expanding from intellectuals to the broad masses of workers and peasants.

This year, China's drama, music, and art creation also have a new look. Many playwrights, musicians, and artists have used their works to quickly cooperate with the current political struggles and economic construction. The Beijing drama troupes have created and performed more than 230 new plays in four months. Many famous musicians and composers have quickly created a large number of mass songs in cooperation with the Great Leap Forward and the struggle to defend peace over the past year. The large number of posters, cartoons, sculptures, etc. created by artists to cooperate with the current political struggle have made great leaps in quantity and quality. In the past year, while going down to the countryside and factories to deepen their lives, artists from all over the country have also created more than a thousand pieces of Chinese paintings, oil paintings, sculptures, and other works.

The new situation of China's literary and artistic creation has emerged after the literary and artistic circles smashed the attacks of right-wing elements and revisionist ideas and criticized right-leaning conservative ideas. It is the result of the broad masses of writers and artists implementing the Communist Party's literary and artistic policies, going deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers, and earnestly transforming their thinking. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than seven hundred writers and artists across the country who have gone to the countryside, factories, and companies. Their positions and thoughts and feelings have changed or are changing, and they are determined to transform themselves in long-term labor training and actual struggles, and to continue to work hard in their creations and write more and better works to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

    广大群众参加创作活动  作家艺术家深入工农兵
    我国文学艺术创作百花争荣
    据新华社28日讯  一年来，工农兵群众文艺创作空前繁荣、共产主义的文学艺术正在这一群众性创作运动中萌芽、茁壮。文艺为政治服务、为生产服务的工农兵方向，也通过当前群众文艺创作运动的发展，取得了决定性的胜利。
    去冬今春以来，全国范围内，工农兵群众以诗歌、快板、散文、剧本、小说、曲艺、美术、音乐等各种文艺形式，反映新生活和过去斗争生活的作品数以亿计。江苏近半年群众创作达一千万篇之多。全国还出现了许多“人人是诗人，诗为人人赏”的诗乡、诗县、诗厂。河北昌黎、束鹿和江苏邳县等壁画县的出现，反映了大跃进以来群众美术创作活动的空前盛况。群众的歌曲创作活动也形成了热潮。群众在生产劳动中，“干什么，唱什么；干什么，编什么；自己干，自己编，自己唱”。如安徽巢县司集乡群众，全乡男女老少人人是歌手。解放军官兵，创作了成千上万的诗歌、小说、剧本、革命斗争回忆录、以及音乐、美术作品。在这一群众性文艺创作运动中，所有创作都能紧密地配合生产、政治任务，鼓舞了广大群众的革命干劲和劳动热情，既促进了生产，又教育了人民，真正发挥了文艺作为党的宣传、教育工具的作用。
    一年来，工农兵群众的创作，不仅数量惊人，而且出现了不少具有高度思想性和艺术技巧也较完美的优秀作品。如烩炙人口的“我来了”这首诗，反映了劳动人民征服自然的英雄气概，是革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义结合的范例。农民诗人王老九的“三户贫农”，只几句话就道出了合作社的发展前途和党对群众的深切关怀。部队官兵作品中，如一个战士写的诗——“列兵”，以生动的形象，描写了革命军人的自豪感；以及上海国棉十九厂工人要超过李白的豪迈气魄的诗等，都充分显示出诗是劳动的副产物，这些来自工农兵群众的优秀作品，今天已在全国各文艺刊物中占了主要地位。
    今天，群众文艺创作的大跃进是几亿人民的群众运动。因此，这一运动也是共产主义文学艺术大普及的标志，是文化革命的重要部分。劳动人民与文学艺术结缘，建立了体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合的基础，昭示了共产主义文学艺术发展的方向。
    群众文艺创作的繁荣，不仅涌现了千万个优秀工农兵作者，一支无产阶级的文艺创作队伍正在逐渐形成，而且对文学艺术专业队伍也起了鞭策和促进的作用。
    轰轰烈烈的群众文艺创作运动是在党的直接倡导下开展起来的。党中央以至各省、市、自治区党委，都十分重视这一运动的发展。四月以来，各级党委不仅相继发出采风的指示和通知，而且还在党委直接领导下，成立了收集、编选民歌的机构。许多党政负责同志不仅重视这一运动，而且是这一运动的直接参加者。这一群众性的文艺创作运动，雄辩地说明了我们的党，不仅能领导文艺，而且是最懂得文艺的。
    据新华社28日讯  一年来我国的文学艺术创作呈现出一幅空前的百花争荣的景象。
    据北京五个全国性文学艺术书籍出版社的不完全统计，从今年1月到9月底，共出版了新创作的各种形式文艺作品近三百种，总共有一千六百多万册，同去年一年相比，在种类方面增加了将近一半，册数增加了三倍以上。今年上半年全国各地总共有七千多万册文学书籍送到了广大读者手中，这个数字比去年同时期多了一倍。
    今年我国文学艺术创作的繁荣，不仅表现在数量的巨大增长，更突出地表现在作品的思想性和艺术水平都有所提高。拿文学作品来说，表现人民革命英雄主义精神和革命史实的长、短篇小说和诗、回忆录、传记等占着很大的比重，它们在读者中引起了广泛、深刻的影响。迅速反映当前政治斗争和大跃进中新人新事的特写、报告文学等也受到读者的喜爱。一个值得报道的新情况是：一年来，文艺书籍的读者范围，正从知识分子迅速扩大到广大工农群众中去。
    今年我国的戏剧、音乐、美术创作也有新的气象。许多剧作家、音乐家、美术家用他们的作品迅速配合了当前的政治斗争和生产建设。北京的戏剧团体在四个月中就创作和排演出二百三十多出新戏。许多著名的音乐家、作曲家一年来配合大跃进和保卫和平的斗争迅速创作了大量的群众歌曲。美术家们创作的大量配合现实政治斗争的招贴画、漫画、雕塑等，在数量、质量上都有很大跃进。各地美术家一年来在下乡下厂深入生活的同时，还创作出一千多件国画、油画、雕塑等作品。
    我国文艺创作的新局面，是在文艺界粉碎了右派分子进攻和修正主义思想，批判了右倾保守思想以后出现的，是广大作家、艺术家贯彻共产党的文艺方针，深入工农兵，认真改造思想的结果。据不完全统计，目前全国已经有七百多个作家，艺术家到农村、工厂、连队里去。他们的立场和思想情感已经或正在起变化，决心长期在劳动锻炼和实际斗争中改造自己，并且在创作上继续苦战，写出更多更好的作品来迎接建国十周年。
