Xinhua News Agency, September 19th—The Ministry of Culture recently held a national conference on newspaper and book printing in Beijing, summarizing the newspaper and book printing work of the past nine years and discussing the development direction and the Great Leap Forward plan for the future.

The meeting unanimously clarified that newspaper and book printing work should serve politics and publishing. Newspaper and book printing work serves politics, socialism, and workers, peasants, and soldiers through publishing. Without serving publishing, it loses its special significance as a cultural industry.

The meeting held that the situation of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the continuous upsurge of technological and cultural revolutions require the printing industry to develop more, faster, better, and more economically, creating conditions and a material foundation for the development of news and publishing undertakings in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. The representatives put forward a bold slogan: "Fight hard for three years to establish a national newspaper and book printing network from the central to the county level, combining large, medium, and small sizes, and combining indigenous and foreign methods." The meeting believed that the backbone role of large factories should not be ignored in the construction of the printing network, but more attention should be paid to running small and medium-sized factories to give full play to the enthusiasm of all parties and accelerate the construction progress. The large number of printing machines required for the construction of the printing network should also adopt a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, relying on the enthusiasm of various provinces and cities to manufacture them themselves.

The meeting believed that the key to realizing the above-mentioned guidelines and plans lies in putting politics in command and breaking superstitions. We should uproot the white flags of purely economic viewpoints and departmentalism, and plant the red flags of serving politics and serving publishing. We must break down inferiority complexes and mystical viewpoints, and greatly promote the spirit of communist collaboration.

Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the achievements of newspaper and book printing work in the past nine years are the main thing. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, the printing industry has done many things that it dared not think of or do in the past. Printing work is developing towards a new stage. The main sign of this new stage is serving the great development of cultural and publishing undertakings on a larger scale and at a faster speed. Liu Zhiming emphasized that it is very important to raise the understanding of serving politics and serving publishing to the height of guidelines and lines.

    印刷工作必须政治挂帅
    文化部召开会议确定报刊印刷工作方针任务
    据新华社19日讯　文化部最近在北京召开全国报纸书刊印刷工作会议，总结了九年来报纸书刊印刷工作，讨论了今后发展的方针和大跃进的规划。
    会上一致明确了报纸书刊印刷工作应该为政治服务为出版服务的方针。报纸书刊印刷工作是通过出版工作来体现为政治服务为社会主义服务为工农兵服务的，离开为出版服务，就失去其文化工业的特殊意义。
    会议认为工农业生产大跃进和技术革命、文化革命不断高涨的形势，要求多快好省地发展印刷工业，为多快好省地发展新闻出版事业创造条件和物质基础。代表们提出了一个豪迈的口号：“苦战三年，建立一个从中央到县的、大中小并举的、土洋结合的全国报纸书刊印刷网”。会议认为，在建设印刷网的工作中，大型工厂的骨干作用不能忽视，但更要注意举办中小型厂，充分发挥各方面的积极性，加快建设进度。建设印刷网所需要的大量印刷机器，也应采取土洋结合的办法，依靠各省市的积极性自己制造。
    会议认为，实现上述方针和规划的关键在于政治挂帅，破除迷信。应该拔除单纯经济观点和本位主义的白旗，要插上为政治服务为出版服务的红旗。要破除自卑思想和神秘观点，大大提倡共产主义的协作精神。
    文化部副部长刘芝明到会讲了话。他指出，九年来报纸书刊印刷工作成绩是主要的。特别是大跃进以来，印刷事业做了很多过去不敢想不敢做的事。印刷工作正在向新的阶段发展，这个新的阶段的主要标志是：以更大的规模和速度为文化出版事业的大发展服务。刘芝明着重指出：把为政治服务为出版服务提高到方针路线的高度上来认识，是非常重要的。
