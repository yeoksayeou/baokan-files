Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 10th—The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council issued a statement today condemning the United States' provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait region and strongly demanding the immediate and complete withdrawal of American troops from the Taiwan area.

The statement severely condemned the landing of large numbers of American aggressor troops in Taiwan and considered this action an open threat of the United States expanding its aggression against the People's Republic of China. The statement said that according to recent reports, American warships have intruded into China's territorial waters. This action will intensify the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait and thus threaten peace in the Far East and the world.

The statement emphasized that the United States' support for the Chiang Kai-shek clique entrenched in Taiwan and the Penghu Islands and its direct occupation of these areas with its armed forces is an illegal act of interference in China's internal affairs and a clear violation of China's territorial sovereignty. This action also blatantly violates the United Nations Charter.

The statement said that the Secretariat has been paying attention for some time to how the Chiang Kai-shek clique, supported by the American imperialists, is using coastal islands such as Jinmen as forward bases to carry out various sabotage activities against the Chinese mainland. The statement pointed out that the People's Republic of China has every right to deal with this American aggression and to take necessary military actions to liberate their territory and deal with the Chiang Kai-shek troops.

The statement pointed out that the United States is simultaneously trying to divert world attention from the fact that American troops continue to be stationed in Lebanon. Because the United States has done so, it has quickly created a new danger of war in the Taiwan Strait, which has made all peace-loving people realize the obvious policy of American imperialism to undermine peace and suppress the independence of Asian and African nations.

The statement expressed anger at the statements made by American military and political leaders, saying that in these statements they indicated that the United States would use atomic weapons in the Far East to prove that it could use this inhumane weapon to conduct their so-called limited wars.

The statement said: We, on behalf of the people of Asia and Africa, welcome the action of the People's Republic of China in negotiating with the United States on this issue, but at the same time, we hope that the United States will not use these negotiations as a smokescreen to cover up its further acts of aggression. We strongly demand the immediate and complete withdrawal of American troops from the Taiwan area to ensure peace in the Far East and the world.

    亚非人民团结理事会书记处发表声明
    不许美国利用谈判作侵略的烟幕
    据新华社开罗10日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天发表声明，谴责美国在中国台湾海峡地区的挑衅行动，并且强烈要求美国军队立即全部撤出台湾地区。
    声明严厉谴责大批美国侵略军在台湾登陆，并且认为这种行动是美国扩大它对中华人民共和国的侵略的公开威胁。声明说，据最近消息，美国军舰已经侵入中国的领海。这个行动会加剧台湾海峡地区的紧张局势，从而威胁远东与世界的和平。
    声明强调指出，美国支持盘据在台湾和澎湖列岛的蒋介石集团和使它的武装部队直接占领这些地区是干涉中国内政的非法行为，并且显然侵犯了中国的领土主权。这种行动还公然违反了联合国宪章。
    声明说，书记处若干时候以来一直在注意得到美帝国主义者支持的蒋介石集团怎样利用像金门这些沿海岛屿作为前沿基地来对中国大陆进行各种破坏活动。声明指出，中华人民共和国完全有权对付美国的这种侵略行为，完全有权采取必要的军事行动来解放他们的领土和对付蒋介石军队。
    声明指出，美国同时是在设法转移世界对美国军队继续驻在黎巴嫩这一事实的注意。由于美国这样做，已经很快造成了台湾海峡地区的新的战争危险，从而已经使一切爱好和平的人民认识到美帝国主义破坏和平和镇压亚非民族独立的明显的政策。
    声明对于美国军政首脑发表的声明表示愤怒，声明说，他们在这些声明中表示，美国将在远东使用原子武器，以证明它可以利用这种非人道的武器来进行他们所谓的局限性战争。
    声明说：我们代表亚非人民欢迎中华人民共和国就这个问题同美国进行谈判的行动，但是同时，我们希望美国不要利用这种谈判作为掩饰它进一步进行侵略行动的烟幕。我们猛力要求美国军队立即全部撤出台湾地区以保证远东与世界的和平。
