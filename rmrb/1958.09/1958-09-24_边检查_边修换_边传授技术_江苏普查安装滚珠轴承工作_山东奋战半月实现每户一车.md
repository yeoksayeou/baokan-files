Jiangsu Carries Out Universal Inspection and Installation of Ball Bearings by Simultaneously Inspecting, Repairing, Replacing and Imparting Technology
Shandong Strives for Half a Month to Achieve One Cart Per Household

(Reported by this newspaper) Jiangsu has adopted a method of simultaneous inspection, repair and replacement, and technology transfer, to comprehensively review and resolve the outstanding issues of the ball-bearing implementation of transportation tools.

Jiangsu Province has achieved remarkable results in the ball-bearing movement. However, comprehensive inspections have also revealed that due to the strong momentum of the movement, the large number of tasks, and the still-unfamiliar operating techniques, the quality of some ball bearings is poor and the installation is not up to standard. A few counties and townships have not yet installed ball bearings on all transportation tools. The Yancheng Prefectural Committee inspected Binhai, Yancheng, and Dongtai counties and found that approximately 10% to 15% of the transportation tools were not equipped with ball bearings. At the same time, a few cadres were satisfied with the achievements already made in the ball-bearing movement and developed a "all is well" mentality.

Party committees at all levels took timely measures, criticizing complacency on the one hand and organizing forces to conduct inspections on the other. LianShui, Suqian, Siyang, Huaiyin and other cities and counties of the Huaiyin Special District adopted the method of “going to the commune, to the team, to the field,” simultaneously inspecting, repairing and replacing, and imparting technology. Wujiang County, with more than 800 iron and wood workers as the main force, established inspection teams in every township, going deep into the fields to check every piece, and solving problems on the spot and repairing them immediately. More than 6,000 poor-quality balls were replaced with good ones.

In the comprehensive review, counties and cities have taken many further measures to continue to consolidate and develop the victorious results of the ball-bearing implementation. These are mainly: (1) Establishing factories that regularly produce ball bearings. (2) Helping townships and communes set up ball-bearing repair stations to hand over the technology to farmers. (3) Transportation tools manufactured by farm tool factories are not allowed to leave the factory if the quality of the ball bearings does not meet the standards. (Yan Fengming)

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 22nd: Riding the wave of the victory of ball-bearing implementation, the people of Shandong Province have, after half a month of hard work, achieved the cart implementation of transportation tools.

Under the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, Shandong Province has a very heavy transportation task. Therefore, at the end of August, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called for a cart implementation movement of one cart per household throughout the province. This call was enthusiastically responded to by the masses. At the beginning of September, the Liaocheng Special District manufactured more than 2,280,000 carts, an average of three carts for every two households. According to statistics, by mid-September, the province had installed more than 9,640,000 various vehicles, which, together with the original more than 2,000,000 vehicles, exceeded the requirement of one vehicle per household.

    边检查　边修换　边传授技术
    江苏普查安装滚珠轴承工作
    山东奋战半月实现每户一车
    本报讯　江苏各地采用边检查、边修换、边传授技术的办法，全面复查和解决运转工具滚珠轴承化的遗留问题。
    江苏省的轴承化运动成绩是显著的。但在全面复查中也发现了由于运动来势猛烈，任务大，操作技术还不太熟练，因此，有一部分滚珠轴承的质量较差，安装不合规格；个别县、乡还没有将全部运转工具装上轴承。盐城地委检查了滨海、盐城、东台三县，约有10％—15％的运转工具未装上轴承。与此同时，少数干部满足于轴承化运动已经取得的成绩，产生了“万事大吉”的思想。
    各级党委及时采取了措施，一方面批判自满思想，一方面组织力量进行了检查。淮阴专区的涟水、宿迁、泗阳、淮阴等县市，采取了“到社、到队、到田”的方法，边检查、边修换、边传授技术。吴江县以八百多个铁、木工人为主，乡乡建立检查组，深入田头，块块查，件件查，发现问题，就地解决，当场修好。并把六千多粒质量较差的弹子换成好弹子。
    在全面复查中，各县市为继续巩固和发展轴承化的胜利成果，又进一步采取许多措施。主要是：（1）建立经常生产滚珠轴承的工厂。（2）帮助乡社设置轴承修配站，将技术交给农民。（3）农具厂制造的运转工具，做到滚珠轴承质量不合规格不准出厂。（严锋明）
    据新华社济南22日电　山东省人民乘滚珠轴承化胜利之风，经半月奋战又实现了运输工具车子化。
    在工农业生产大跃进的新形势下，山东省运输任务非常繁重。因此，中共山东省委在8月底号召在全省范围内开展一户一辆车的车子化运动。这个号召受到广大群众热烈响应。聊城专区在9月初就造车二百二十八万多辆，平均每两户三辆车。据统计，到9月中旬，全省共安装各种车辆九百六十四万多辆，加上原有的二百多万辆，超额实现了每户一辆车的要求。
