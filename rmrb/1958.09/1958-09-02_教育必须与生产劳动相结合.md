　　Education Must Be Combined with Productive Labor
    Lu Dingyi

    Editor's Note from "Red Flag": Comrade Lu Dingyi's article is based on the conclusions of the education work conference convened by the Party Central Committee. The Party Central Committee will soon issue instructions to Party committees at all levels on this matter. We hope that Party committees at all levels will discuss Comrade Lu Dingyi's article in conjunction with the Party's instructions when discussing them. When school Party committees discuss this matter, non-Party professors and teachers may be invited to participate.

    Since the beginning of this year, China's education has developed rapidly. As of the end of June, according to incomplete statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, 1,240 counties across the country have universalized primary school education, there are 68,000 private middle schools, more than 400 new local universities, approximately 90 million people across the country are participating in literacy studies, and 444 counties across the country have basically eliminated illiteracy. The victory of the rectification movement and the struggle against the bourgeois rightists have set off a great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production. The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has in turn set off a high tide of technological and cultural revolutions. The great development of education is one of the signs that the cultural revolution is entering a high tide.

    Two measures at the end of last year and the beginning of this year promoted the development of education. One measure was the implementation of work-study programs in schools across the country. The other measure was the establishment of agricultural middle schools. Work-study programs began to combine ordinary school education with productive labor. This broke the old tradition of ordinary schools looking down on physical labor for a long time, changed the atmosphere of the schools, and also had a very good impact on the social atmosphere. Agricultural middle schools are private, part-time work-study vocational (technical) schools. These schools not only solve the students' requirements for further education, but also prepare technical talents for agricultural production. They are relatively easy to run, are practical for the current situation, do not require the state to spend money, and save the economic burden of the students' parents. Therefore, once they were advocated, they developed rapidly, like bamboo shoots after rain, with tens of thousands of schools established in a few months. Because graduates of senior primary schools no longer have to worry about the opportunity to go to school, private primary schools have also greatly developed, and primary school education has been quickly popularized in many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Due to the needs of production development, adult education has also developed, a high tide of literacy campaigns has appeared, and all kinds of spare-time cultural and technical schools have emerged in large numbers. This high tide of cultural revolution has spread from the countryside to the cities, and a trend of schools running factories and factories running schools has appeared in the cities. Because school education is combined with productive labor, a movement of curriculum reform has emerged in schools, attempts to change the school system have appeared, and the reorganization of the teaching staff has appeared, and so on. Our education is like a hundred flowers blooming and ten thousand horses galloping. Education is breaking through the circle of expert monopoly and dogmatism, and is becoming education run by the whole Party and the whole people, and becoming socialist education suitable for China's conditions. This change has been achieved under the leadership of the Party. The fallacies that "the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical does not apply to education," "laymen cannot lead experts," "Party committees do not understand education," and "the masses do not understand education" are being completely shattered.

    Our country is a proletarian dictatorship and a socialist country. Our education is not capitalist education, but socialist education. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, socialist education is inconceivable. Socialist education is one of the powerful tools for transforming the old society and building a new society. The purpose of socialist revolution and socialist construction is to eliminate all exploiting classes and all systems of exploitation and their remnants, to realize the communist society of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," to eliminate the differences between cities and villages, and to eliminate the differences between mental and physical labor. This purpose is also the purpose of socialist education. Only the proletarian party—the Communist Party—can lead such education. The bourgeoisie is not qualified to lead such education. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can education have the new look we see today.

    In recent years, there have been long-term disputes over the issue of education policy. At the education work conferences convened by the CPC Central Committee in April and June this year, a series of theoretical and practical problems were resolved.

    The Chinese Communist Party's education policy has always been that education serves the politics of the working class, and education is combined with productive labor; in order to achieve this policy, education must be led by the Communist Party. This policy is sharply opposed to the bourgeois education policy. Bourgeois education is led by bourgeois politicians, serves bourgeois politics, that is, serves the bourgeois dictatorship, and is incompatible with the proletarian dictatorship. Under the socialist system, the bourgeoisie does not dare to directly and publicly propose that education should be led by bourgeois politicians, and that education should become a tool against the proletarian dictatorship. It can only put forward the false and deceptive propositions of "education is led by experts" and "education for education's sake" to achieve the purpose of opposing education serving the proletarian dictatorship. Therefore, in our socialist country, the bourgeois education policy is manifested as: education for education's sake, the separation of mental and physical labor, and education led by experts.

    Education is primarily about imparting and learning knowledge. But what is knowledge? What is the purpose of imparting and learning? Our understanding of these questions is different from that of the bourgeoisie. Most bourgeois education scholars believe that only book knowledge is knowledge, and practical experience does not count as knowledge. Therefore, they believe that education is reading, the more people read, the more knowledgeable they are, and those with book knowledge are superior to others. As for productive labor, especially physical labor and physical laborers, that is despicable, that is a "dead end." Other bourgeois education scholars believe that education is life, and life is education. They neither understand life as the practice of class struggle and production struggle, nor emphasize the importance of theory, and thus actually go to the point of canceling education. The above two seemingly absolutely opposite views of the bourgeoisie come from a common source. They say that people have no class distinctions, and that pedagogy is a trans-class discipline.

    Our view is different. We believe that pedagogy is a social science. All social sciences must follow politics, and pedagogy is no exception. People need education in order to carry out class struggle and production struggle. We believe that there are only two kinds of knowledge in the world. One is the knowledge of class struggle. This class struggle is the struggle between groups of people divided by economic status. This struggle has existed for thousands of years. Now, during the transition period in our country, there is still class struggle. In the future, after classes are eliminated, although there will be no class struggle, there will still be contradictions within the people. Therefore, there will still be poisonous weeds in ten thousand years, that is, there will still be struggles between truth and falsehood, between the advanced and the backward, and between those who promote and those who hinder the development of productive forces. The other is the knowledge of the struggle for production, that is, the knowledge of the struggle between mankind and nature. And philosophy is the generalization and summary of these two kinds of knowledge. Philosophy is important because dialectical materialism provides people with the correct way of thinking. The essential difference between people lies not in the difference in "temperament" or personality, but first of all in the difference in class stand, and secondly in the difference in the way of thinking. Class stand and way of thinking are related and distinct from each other. Mistakes often come from two sources, one is the class source, and the other is the ideological source. In order to avoid making big mistakes or making fewer mistakes, people should study politics and philosophy. We communists also believe that there are two kinds of one-sided and incomplete knowledge. Book knowledge that is completely divorced from practical activity is a kind of one-sided and incomplete knowledge. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "What is the book knowledge of the students? Assuming that their knowledge is all truth, it is also the theory written by their predecessors who summarized the experience of production struggle and class struggle, not the knowledge they have personally obtained. It is absolutely necessary for them to accept this knowledge, but they must know that, in a certain situation, this knowledge is still one-sided for them, this knowledge has been proved by others, but they have not yet proved it. The most important thing is to be good at applying this knowledge to life and practice. Therefore, I advise those who only have book knowledge but have not yet come into contact with practice, or those who have little practical experience, to understand their shortcomings and be more modest." The lack of theoretical, sensory or partial experience is also a kind of one-sided and incomplete knowledge. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If our comrades who are engaged in practical work misuse their experience, there will also be problems. It is true that such people often have a lot of experience, which is very valuable; but if they are satisfied with their own experience, it is also very dangerous. They must know that their knowledge is biased towards sensory or partial, lacking rational knowledge and universal knowledge, that is, lacking theory, and their knowledge is also relatively incomplete. And in order to do a good job in the revolutionary cause, it is impossible without relatively complete knowledge." What is relatively complete knowledge? Comrade Mao Zedong said: "There is only one kind of real theory in the world, that is, the theory that is drawn from objective reality and proved in objective reality, and nothing else can be called the theory we are talking about." "All relatively complete knowledge is composed of two stages: the first stage is perceptual knowledge, and the second stage is rational knowledge. Rational knowledge is the advanced stage of development of perceptual knowledge." "There are two kinds of incomplete knowledge, one is the knowledge on existing books, and the other is the knowledge that is biased towards sensory and partial knowledge. Both of these are one-sided. Only when the two are combined can good, relatively complete knowledge be produced." ("Rectifying the Party's Style of Work," "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume III) The purpose of education is to enable students to obtain relatively complete knowledge, not one-sided and incomplete knowledge. Therefore, teachers are also required to have relatively complete knowledge.

    Our education workers often say that "education is the cause of the people." This is good, because in our country, this is the truth. However, judging from the experience of nine years, there are also two different understandings of this sentence. Bourgeois education scholars believe that the masses of the people should have a share in receiving education, but when it comes to running education, the masses of the people have no share, only experts have a share. Their slogans are "professors govern the school," "laymen cannot lead experts," "the Party does not understand education," "the masses do not understand education," "students cannot criticize teachers," and so on. Some comrades also believed in this kind of superstition spread by bourgeois educators, forgetting that our Party had been said to be a "layman" a thousand times and ten thousand times, but in the end, the facts proved that our Party was more expert than any expert. Some of our comrades put forward such propositions: (1) only the state is allowed to run schools, (2) only one kind of school is allowed to be run—full-time ordinary schools. Experience has proved that bourgeois education scholars are very interested in this kind of proposition, because it can restrain the hands of the masses and prevent them from running schools. Bourgeois education scholars understand that if education is run according to this kind of proposition, it will be very difficult for China to popularize primary and secondary school education, and there will be no hope of popularizing higher education, because the state cannot afford this huge amount of funds, and production will also suffer greatly. We communists are different from bourgeois education scholars. We believe that the masses of the people need education for the sake of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Since the masses of the people can do revolutionary work and construction work, then the masses of the people can not only receive education, but also run education. Running education needs to rely on a specialized team. It is impossible without a strong specialized team. Now, we should greatly strengthen this specialized team by transferring cadres and running normal schools. However, the specialized team of education must be combined with the masses, and running education must rely more on the masses. Only under the leadership of the Party, combining professional educators with the masses, adopting the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses," and implementing education run by the whole people, can our education be run more, faster, better, and more economically. Only under the leadership of the Party, implementing education run by the whole people, can we coordinate the overall situation, take care of all parties, coordinate all parties, and develop education in a way that is beneficial to the development of production rather than harmful to it.

    Our education workers also often talk about "education work should be led by the Party," which is undoubtedly correct, because socialist education must be led by the Communist Party, and the education of the socialist People's Republic of China must be led by the Communist Party of China. However, there are also different understandings of what leadership is and what kind of leadership is needed. Bourgeois educators believe that the so-called "Party leadership" is "political leadership by the Party, and professional leadership by me." They can listen to the Party on issues unrelated to education, but if the Party wants to interfere in the education's guidelines, policies, systems, methods, etc., they think it is unacceptable. They want the Party to lead in word, but not in deed, they can listen to the Party on minor issues, but confront the Party on major issues. Some comrades in our Party who are engaged in education work regard themselves as experts to the Party committee and do not respect the leadership of the Party committee. This is the manifestation of the bourgeois influence in the Party. In recent years, a "theory" has been widely spread in the education field in our country, believing that the main laws of education are derived from the research of education history. Therefore, as long as one studies education history and abstractly acknowledges the leadership of the Party, one can run socialist education without the Party's specific leadership over education. Studying education history, if it is studied from the perspective of Marxist historical materialism, is of course beneficial, and one can know the laws of education in the era of class society for thousands of years. But it must be known that the laws of education in this class society history are not equal to the laws of socialist education, let alone the laws of Chinese socialist education. Education in the past thousands of years was education in the hands of slave owners, education in the hands of the landlord class, and education in the hands of the bourgeoisie. The main laws found in such education history are the laws of education of the exploiting classes. There must be a great distance between such education laws and socialist education laws. If they are copied verbatim, mistakes will inevitably be made. In fact, it has been proved that the so-called "the main laws of education are derived from the research of education history" is actually using education history as an excuse to move the bourgeois educational thoughts, education policies, education systems, education methods, etc. to the socialist system without any changes, pretending to be socialist goods. Chinese education history has a people's side. Confucius's teaching regardless of class, Mencius's emphasis on the people and light on the monarch, Xunzi's determination to conquer nature, Qu Yuan's criticism of the evils of the monarch, Sima Qian's praise of resistance, Wang Chong, Fan Zhen, Liu Zongyuan, Zhang Zai, Wang Fuzhi's ancient materialism, Guan Hanqing, Shi Nai'an, Wu Cheng'en, Cao Xueqin's democratic literature, Sun Yat-sen's democratic revolution, people's situations are different, many people have no educational works, but the above-mentioned must affect the education of the people, and they should be mentioned when talking about Chinese education history. But from the main aspect of education history, education for thousands of years has indeed been a tool in the hands of the exploiting classes, while socialist education is a tool in the hands of the working class. From a tool in the hands of the exploiting classes to a tool in the hands of the working class is a qualitative leap in education, a great revolution in education itself. To study education history and not see this qualitative leap is to leave dialectics and is metaphysics. We advocate studying education history, but we oppose the view that studying education history can lead to the main laws of socialist education, because this view will cause us to make right-leaning mistakes. Not only that, but even the laws of socialist education, in addition to having commonalities, also have different characteristics in different countries. Not studying one's own characteristics will lead to dogmatic errors. What are the characteristics of our country? First, our country is a socialist country; second, the population is large and the area is vast; third, the economy is backward and the culture is backward; fourth, there is the leadership of the Communist Party and a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production; fifth, and this is the most important, our country is a country that is seriously carrying out rectification and anti-rightism, and is a country of great contending, great blooming, great debate, and big-character posters. We should combine the universal truth of Marxism with the specific reality of our country to formulate our country's education guidelines, education policies, education systems, education methods, etc. according to our own characteristics. From this, it can be seen that the so-called "the main laws of education are derived from the research of education history" is a very harmful "theory" that detaches education from reality and falls into right-leaning errors and dogmatic errors. Not starting from the objective reality of one's own country is a subjective way of thinking, and is an anti-Marxist way of thinking. If one makes a mistake in the way of thinking, one will not find the main laws of the development of things. As long as one does not start from reality and violates the universal truth of Marxism, one will definitely make mistakes, either right-leaning mistakes or dogmatic mistakes, or both kinds of mistakes, which is an important lesson that should be drawn in our country's education work. We are Marxists, and we advocate that we must start from the objective reality, so we must first seriously study our own situation, and we must have the enthusiasm to do this research work. We also seriously study the experience of fraternal countries and seriously study history, but the purpose is not to copy or transport, but to understand the historical situation, understand historical materialism in education, so as to learn from it and do our own work well according to our own situation. No matter what work we do, we must rely closely on the leadership of the Party, because it is the Communist Party, not others, that best understands our own situation and best understands Marxism. The Communist Party is the highest form of organization of the working class, and the Communist Party must and can lead everything. The Communist Party, from the central to the grassroots organizations, is the organized and disciplined vanguard of the working class. We rely on this team to win the victory of the revolutionary war, rely on this team to win the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front, political front, and ideological front, and we must also rely on this team to win the victory of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution. Our education workers should not only accept the leadership of the Party politically, but also accept the leadership of the Party in educational thought, education policy, and education business, so that they will not lag behind the times, and they will make fewer mistakes and not make mistakes.

    The debate in education work in recent years, in the final analysis, is concentratedly manifested in the question of "what is all-round development." "Cultivating all-round development of mankind" is what Marxists advocate, and Marxists advocate achieving this goal through education. Our education workers often talk about all-round development, which is good. However, there are principled differences in the understanding of "all-round development." Judging from the experience of nine years of education work in our country, bourgeois education scholars do not directly and publicly oppose all-round development, they even seem to "actively support" this policy, but they advocate that all-round development should be unilaterally understood as enabling students to have broad book knowledge, but at the same time, they neither advocate that students learn politics nor advocate that students participate in productive labor. This actually vulgarizes all-round development, making it equivalent to the bourgeois educational policy of cultivating so-called "generalists." Our communists have a fundamentally different understanding of all-round development from bourgeois education scholars. All-round development contains such a fundamental content, that is, to enable students to have relatively broad knowledge, become all-rounders, and be able to "alternately transfer from one production sector to another according to the needs of society or their own hobbies." (Engels: "Principles of Communism") We advocate that workers become all-rounders in industrial production, farmers become all-rounders in agricultural production, and we advocate that workers are also farmers and farmers are also workers, and advocate that citizens serve in the military, and soldiers become producers after retiring from the army, advocate that cadres participate in labor, and producers participate in management. These propositions have been gradually implemented. This method of both division of labor and transferability is suitable for the needs of society and is much more reasonable than the division of labor under the capitalist system. It not only increases production, but also enables the country to reasonably allocate productive forces without causing social unrest when a certain need arises in society. The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country has now begun to raise such a question: when certain products have reached the maximum limit that can meet the needs of the people in the current period and there is a surplus, some of the producers of these products should transfer to other production sectors. At that time, not transferring will not meet the needs of the people, and will not meet the needs of the continued development of social productive forces and the continued improvement of people's lives. Our education work and other relevant work of the country must prepare conditions for this transfer. Education should enable students to acquire broad knowledge, but how broad it is depends on the specific objective and subjective conditions. In the future, in a completely consolidated, fully developed, and fully mature communist society, people who can do many things, who can take on many occupations, but who have key knowledge and abilities will be cultivated. This is our direction, and we must move in this direction. Under the current conditions in our country, we can cultivate all-rounders, but we cannot yet cultivate "people who can take on any occupation." Another fundamental content contained in all-round development is that the knowledge learned by students must be relatively complete knowledge, not one-sided and incomplete knowledge. This requires implementing education to serve politics and education to be combined with productive labor. Marx said of his ideal future education: "This education combines productive labor with intellectual and physical education for every child who has reached a certain age, which is not only a way to increase social production, but also the only way to cultivate all-round development of mankind." ("Capital," Volume I) This means that students are required to learn relatively complete knowledge, and they can not only use their brains to labor, but also use their hands to labor. Only having book knowledge, no matter how broad it is, is still one-sided and incomplete knowledge. People who only have a lot of book knowledge without practical work experience are only the so-called "generalists" of the bourgeoisie, not the all-round development of people that we call. Childhood needs to develop the body, and this development must be sound. Childhood needs to develop communist sentiments, style, and the spirit of collective heroism, which is the moral education of our time. These two are connected to intellectual education. Both are related to engaging in labor, so the principle of combining education with labor is immutable. Summarizing what has been said above, the all-round development that we advocate is to enable students to acquire relatively complete and relatively broad knowledge, develop a sound body, and develop communist morality. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Our education policy should enable those receiving education to develop in morality, intelligence, and physical education, and become educated laborers with socialist consciousness." This is the education policy of all-round development. "Educated laborers with socialist consciousness" are people who understand politics, have culture, can engage in mental labor, and can engage in physical labor. This is an all-round development of people, that is, people who are both red and expert, that is, working-class intellectuals, that is, intellectuals who have been working-classed.

    We advocate the education policy of all-round development, and we believe that the only way to cultivate all-round development of mankind is to have education serve the politics of the proletariat and education be combined with productive labor. We say "the only way" means that there is no other way besides this. Bourgeois education scholars do not think so. They believe that the only way to cultivate their so-called "all-round development" of people is to read and memorize books, and they try every means to oppose students learning politics, especially to oppose students becoming laborers. According to our education policy of all-round development, we can and should rely on the masses to run schools. According to the bourgeois education policy of so-called "all-round development," we can only rely on experts to run schools, and cannot rely on the masses of the people to run schools. According to our education policy of all-round development, education should be led by the Party. According to the bourgeois policy of so-called "all-round development," education can only be led by experts, and there is no need for Party leadership, because the Party is a "layman." From this, it can be seen that different understandings of all-round development lead to a series of different and even opposite arguments. Therefore, we say that the debate in education work in recent years, in the final analysis, is concentratedly manifested in the question of "what is all-round development." The nature of this struggle is the struggle between the two educational thoughts of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

    If we act according to the understanding of knowledge, education as the cause of the people, the leadership of the Party, and all-round development of the bourgeois education scholars in our country, our education will return to the old road of the bourgeoisie. Because of this, we must make it clear how our communists understand these issues.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China nine years ago, China's education work has achieved great achievements under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. These achievements are: recovering the sovereignty of education from the imperialists; properly taking over the schools across the country; abolishing the Kuomintang reactionaries' fascist management system of schools and the fascist education and special agent rule of students; establishing a socialist education system; basically eliminating the counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements hidden in the education field; opening courses in Marxism-Leninism in schools; carrying out ideological transformation among teachers and students; carrying out the adjustment of departments and teaching reform; carrying out the struggle against the bourgeois rightists; the number of students in colleges, middle schools, and primary schools has increased several times; the literacy campaign and spare-time cultural and technical education have greatly developed; work-study programs have begun to be widely implemented in schools; Party organizations have been established in the ranks of education workers; and a large number of cadres have been trained for socialist construction. However, on the education front, the struggle between the working class ideology and the bourgeois ideology is constantly going on. This struggle, in its nature, is the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. The bourgeois ideology hinders the development of education. The bourgeois rightists, in their rampant attack, even attempted to use students as stepping stones for the restoration of capitalism. At that time, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, etc. all dreamed of this. The victory of the anti-rightist struggle and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production turned bad things into good things, and people deeply realized the danger and harm of the bourgeois ideology in education work. Nine years of work have given us experience and made it possible for us to more clearly and systematically expound the Party's education work policy.

    The main error and shortcoming in education work is that education is divorced from productive labor. The combination of education and productive labor is a policy that our Party put forward as early as 1934. At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "What is the general policy of Soviet culture and education? It lies in educating the vast working people with the spirit of communism, in making culture and education serve the revolutionary war and class struggle, in linking education with labor, and in making the vast Chinese people become people who enjoy civilized happiness." In 1954, when the period of economic recovery had passed and the first five-year plan had begun, the Party Central Committee had also proposed the issue of adding courses in productive labor in schools. But it encountered some obstacles and was not able to be implemented. The National Propaganda Work Conference in March 1957, the editorial of the "People's Daily" on April 8 of the same year, and the Nanning Conference in January 1958, the Party Central Committee repeatedly emphasized the proposition that education must be combined with productive labor. It was not until now that the Party's proposition has been realized nationwide. Education serves politics, education is combined with productive labor, and education must be led by the Party. These three are interrelated. Since education is divorced from productive labor, it is bound to neglect politics and the leadership of the Party to a certain extent. In this way, education deviates from the reality of our country, and right-leaning and dogmatic errors are bound to occur.

    The combination of education and productive labor is needed by the socialist revolution, needed by socialist construction, needed by the far-reaching goal of building a communist society, and needed by developing education more, faster, better, and more economically.

    The socialist revolution is to eliminate all exploiting classes and all systems of exploitation and their remnants. Now, the socialist revolution has achieved a basic victory on the economic front, and has achieved a decisive victory on the political front and ideological front. Our task, as pointed out in the resolution of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, is to "actively carry out the technical revolution and the cultural revolution while continuing to carry out the socialist revolution on the economic front, the political front, and the ideological front." The cultural revolution is to make the 600 million people of our country, except for those who cannot produce and cannot study, all produce and all study. That is to make the workers and peasants of our country knowledgeable, and at the same time make the intellectuals of our country labor. Only when both workers and peasants and intellectuals develop in the aspects they lack can the unreasonable situation left over from the old society be completely changed, and the backward phenomena on both sides be eliminated, that is, the phenomenon of lack of culture among workers and peasants, and also the bourgeois ideology among intellectuals. Therefore, this is an extremely profound revolution, and this revolution requires education to serve the politics of the working class and requires education to be combined with productive labor. Marx said: "The early combination of productive labor and education is one of the most powerful means of transforming modern society." ("Critique of the Gotha Program") Without the combination of education and productive labor, the cultural revolution cannot be realized. The cultural revolution is beneficial to our country, to the workers and peasants, and to the intellectuals. Only those who adhere to the bourgeois stand are unwilling to have such a revolution. The bourgeois education policy, the policy of education for education's sake, and the policy of the separation of mental and physical labor are incompatible with the socialist revolution.

    Socialist construction requires boosting morale, striving for the upstream, implementing diligence and thrift in building the country, and also requires technology and culture, and requires cultivating a large number of technical talents who are both red and expert more, faster, better, and more economically. In order to meet this need of socialist construction, it is also necessary to implement the combination of education and productive labor. Lenin said: "The ideal of future society cannot be imagined if the teaching and productive labor of the younger generation are not combined; we cannot raise the teaching and education divorced from productive labor or the productive labor divorced from the corresponding teaching and education to the height required by modern technology and the current state of scientific knowledge." ("Typical of the Empty Plans of the Populists," published in "Education Translation News" No. 6, 1956) The policy of combining education with productive labor will inevitably improve the quality of education, not only in terms of intellectual education, but also in terms of moral and physical education. The education policy of separating mental and physical labor cannot meet the needs of socialist construction.

    The future communist society is a society where each does his best and each takes what he needs, and it is also a society that has eliminated the differences between cities and villages and eliminated the differences between mental and physical labor. Due to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country, the realization of communism is no longer a distant prospect. In order to realize the communist society, Marx and Engels, in the "Communist Manifesto" written 110 years ago, put forward ten methods that "can be adopted almost everywhere in all advanced countries," of which the first to eighth have been realized in our country by adopting methods suitable for our actual conditions, and the ninth and tenth are being realized, that is: "Combine agriculture with industry; gradually eliminate the opposition between town and country"; "Combine education with material production." As everyone sees, due to the fact that our country has adopted the policy of "simultaneous development of industry and agriculture under the condition of priority development of heavy industry; simultaneous development of central industry and local industry, large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises under the condition of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation" in the work of developing industry, industry has also appeared in the countryside, and the phenomenon of workers who are also farmers and farmers who are also workers has appeared. This phenomenon is the budding of communist society. Due to the initial implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor, schools have run factories and farms, and factories and agricultural cooperatives have run many schools, and the phenomenon of students who are also workers and farmers and workers and farmers who are also students has begun to appear. This phenomenon is also the budding of communist society. It can be conceived that when our country enters communist society, the grassroots organizations of our society will be many communist communes. With a few exceptions, each grassroots unit will be complete with all kinds of industries, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. In terms of education, each grassroots unit will have its own elementary schools, secondary schools, and universities; at the same time, everyone will have time to receive education, and will be both laborers and intellectuals. Engels once predicted this situation in "On the Housing Question": "It is precisely because of this industrial revolution that the productive forces of human labor have reached such a height that, for the first time in human history, it has become possible, under the conditions of reasonable division of labor, not only to produce sufficient goods to satisfy the large consumption of all members of society and create abundant reserve stocks, but also to enable everyone to have sufficient leisure time to inherit everything that is truly valuable from the culture passed down from history—science, art, public life, etc.—and not only inherit it, but also turn all of this from the monopoly of the ruling class into the common property of the whole society, and promote its further development." In order to realize this prospect, our education should not move in the direction of separating mental and physical labor, but should move in the direction of combining mental labor and physical labor and combining education and productive labor.

    Developing education more, faster, better, and more economically is impossible in the eyes of bourgeois educators. The great development of education since the beginning of this year has proved that adopting the mass line to run education can make education develop more, faster, better, and more economically. Implementing the combination of education and labor and making education a cause that is warmly welcomed by workers and peasants is an important method of mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses to run schools. The mass line of running schools under the leadership of the Party is: First, the combination of unity and diversity. The training goal is unified, that is, to train educated laborers with socialist consciousness, but the central government, local governments, and factories, mines, enterprises, and agricultural cooperatives can all run schools, and the form of schools should allow for a variety of forms. Schools can be full-time, part-time work-study, or spare-time learning, and can be free or charged. The current spare-time schools will become the same as part-time work-study schools under the circumstances that production is more developed and working hours can be shortened. Under the circumstances that production is greatly developed and public accumulation is greatly increased, charged schools will also become free schools. Second, the combination of popularization and improvement, improving on the basis of popularization, and popularizing under the guidance of improvement. A part of full-time, part-time work-study, and spare-time schools undertake the task of improvement, and at the same time widely popularize education in the form of part-time work-study and spare-time learning. This kind of school used to popularize education, because it is part-time work-study and spare-time, can solve all or most of its own funding, can find teachers locally according to the principle of "the able are teachers," and then gradually develop into schools that are increasingly complete in terms of curriculum, equipment, and teachers with

　　教育必须与生产劳动相结合
    陆定一
    “红旗”编辑部按：陆定一同志这篇文章，是根据党中央召集的教育工作会议的结论写出的。党中央对这个问题即将有指示发给各级党委。我们希望各级党委在讨论党的指示的时候，结合陆定一同志的文章予以讨论。在学校党委讨论此事的时候，可以吸收非党的教授教员参加。
    今年年初以来，我国教育事业有了很快的发展。截至6月底为止，据国家统计局不完全的统计，全国已有一千二百四十个县普及了小学教育，民办中学达六万八千所，地方新办的高等学校达四百余所，全国参加扫盲学习的约达九千余万人，全国已有四百四十四个县基本上扫除了文盲。整风运动和反对资产阶级右派的斗争的胜利，掀起了我国工农业生产的大跃进。工农业生产的大跃进，又掀起了技术革命和文化革命的高潮。教育事业的大发展，是文化革命进入高潮的标志之一。
    去年年底和今年年初有两个措施推动了教育事业的发展。一个措施，是全国学校实行勤工俭学。另一个措施，是农业中学的开办。勤工俭学，开始把普通学校教育同生产劳动结合起来。打破了普通学校长期以来轻视体力劳动的旧传统，改变了学校的风气，也对社会风气发生了很好的影响。农业中学是一种民办的半工半读的职业（技术）学校，这种学校既解决学生升学的要求，又为农业生产准备技术人才，既比较容易办，又切合当前的实用，既不用国家花钱，也节省了学生家长的经济负担，所以一经提倡，发展之快，犹如雨后春笋，几个月就有了几万所。由于高小毕业生不愁没有升学的机会了，于是民办小学也大大发展起来，小学教育在不少省、市、自治区很快就普及了。由于生产发展的需要，成人教育也发展了，扫盲运动的高潮出现了，各种各样的业余文化技术学校也大量出现了。这种文化革命的高潮，又从乡村推进到城市，城市里出现了学校办工厂和工厂办学校的潮流。由于学校教育同生产劳动相结合，在学校里又出现了课程改革的运动，出现了改变学制的尝试，出现了教师队伍的改组等等。我们的教育事业，正如百花齐放，万马奔腾。教育事业正在打破专家包办和教条主义的圈子，变为全党全民办学，变为适合于我国情况的社会主义的教育事业。这种改变，是在党的领导之下实现的。所谓“多快好省不适用于教育”，“外行不能领导内行”，“党委不懂教育”，“群众不懂教育”等等谬论，正在被彻底粉碎。
    我国是无产阶级专政的国家，是社会主义的国家。我国的教育，不是资本主义的教育，而是社会主义的教育。没有共产党的领导，社会主义的教育是不能设想的。社会主义的教育，是改造旧社会和建设新社会的强有力的工具之一。社会主义革命和社会主义建设的目的，是要消灭一切剥削阶级和一切剥削制度及其残余，实现各尽所能，各取所需，消灭城市与乡村的差别和消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别的共产主义社会。这个目的，也就是社会主义教育的目的。这样的教育，只有无产阶级的政党——共产党——才能领导，资产阶级是没有资格来领导这样的教育事业的。只有在共产党的领导之下，教育工作才能出现今天我们所看见的这种新气象。
    最近几年，在教育方针的问题上，有过长期的争论。在今年4月和6月中共中央召开的教育工作会议上，解决了一系列的理论问题和实际问题。
    中国共产党的教育方针，向来就是，教育为工人阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合；为了实现这个方针，教育必须由共产党领导。这个方针，是同资产阶级的教育方针针锋相对的。资产阶级的教育，是由资产阶级的政治家领导的，是为资产阶级的政治，即为资产阶级专政服务的，是同无产阶级专政不相容的，在社会主义制度之下，资产阶级不敢直接地公开地提出要教育受资产阶级政治家的领导，要教育成为反对无产阶级专政的工具，它只能提出“教育由专家领导”、“为教育而教育”的虚伪的骗人的主张，来达到反对教育为无产阶级专政服务的目的。所以在我们的社会主义国家中，资产阶级的教育方针表现为：为教育而教育，劳心与劳力分离，教育由专家领导。
    教育首先是传授和学习知识。但什么是知识？传授和学习的目的是什么？对这些问题，我们共产党人的理解是同资产阶级的理解不一样的。资产阶级教育学者的大多数认为，只有书本知识才是知识，实践的经验不算知识。所以，他们认为，教育就是读书，读书愈多的人就愈有知识，有书本知识的人就高人一等。至于生产劳动，尤其是体力劳动和体力劳动者，那是下贱的，那是“绝路”。资产阶级教育学者另外有一些人，则认为教育即是生活，生活即是教育。他们既不把生活理解为阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践，又不强调理论的重要性，因而实际上走到取消教育。资产阶级的上述两种看来似乎绝对相反的观点，来自一个共同的根源。他们说，人是没有阶级之分的，教育学是一门超阶级的学问。
      我们共产党人的看法，与此不同。我们认为，教育学是社会科学。一切社会科学都要跟政治走，教育学亦不例外。人们是为了进行阶级斗争和生产斗争而需要教育的。我们认为，世界上的知识只有两门。一门是阶级斗争的知识。这种阶级斗争是以经济地位划分的人的集团之间的斗争，这种斗争已经存在了几千年。现在，在我国过渡时期内，还有阶级斗争。在将来，阶级消灭之后，虽然阶级斗争没有了，但是还有人民内部的矛盾，因而一万年还会有毒草，即是说，还会有真理和谬误之间的斗争，先进和落后之间的斗争，对于生产力的发展的促进派和促退派之间的斗争。另一门是生产斗争的知识，即是人类与自然作斗争的知识。而哲学则是这两门知识的概括和总结。哲学之所以重要，因为辩证唯物主义的哲学给人们提供正确的思想方法。人与人的本质的区别，不在于“气质”或性格的不同，而首先是阶级立场不同，再则是思想方法不同。阶级立场与思想方法，是互相联系又互相区别的。错误常常来自两个根源，一个是阶级根源，一个是思想根源。人们要不犯大错误或少犯错误，就应当学习政治，学习哲学。我们共产主义者又认为，有两种片面性的不完全的知识。同实际活动完全脱离关系的书本知识，是一种片面性的不完全的知识。毛泽东同志说：“学生们的书本知识是什么知识呢？假定他们的知识都是真理，也是他们的前人总结生产斗争和阶级斗争的经验写成的理论，不是他们自己亲身得来的知识。他们接受这种知识是完全必要的，但是必须知道，就一定的情况说来，这种知识对于他们还是片面性的，这种知识是人家证明了，而在他们则还没有证明的。最重要的，是善于将这些知识应用到生活和实际中去。所以我劝那些只有书本知识但还没有接触实际的人，或者实际经验尚少的人，应该明白自己的缺点，将自己的态度放谦虚一些。”缺乏理论的、偏于感性的或局部的经验，也是一种片面性的不完全的知识。毛泽东同志说：“我们从事实际工作的同志，如果误用了他们的经验，也是要出毛病的。不错，这样的人往往经验很多，这是很可宝贵的；但是如果他们就以自己的经验为满足，那也很危险。他们须知自己的知识是偏于感性的或局部的，缺乏理性的知识和普遍的知识，就是说，缺乏理论，他们的知识也是比较地不完全。而要把革命事业做好，没有比较完全的知识是不行的。”什么才是比较完全的知识呢？毛泽东同志说：“真正的理论在世界上只有一种，就是从客观实际抽出来又在客观实际中得到了证明的理论，没有任何别的东西可以称得起我们所讲的理论。”“一切比较完全的知识都是由两个阶段构成的：第一阶段是感性知识，第二阶段是理性知识，理性知识是感性知识的高级发展阶段。”“有两种不完全的知识，一种是现成书本上的知识，一种是偏于感性和局部的知识，这二者都有片面性。只有使二者互相结合，才会产生好的比较完全的知识。”（“整顿党的作风”，“毛泽东选集”第三卷）教育的目的，是使学生得到比较完全的知识，而不是片面性的不完全的知识。为此，就要求教师也要有比较完全的知识。
    我们的教育工作者，常常说“教育是人民的事业”。这是好的，因为在我们的国家里，这是真理。但是，从九年的经验来看，对于这句话也有两种不同的了解。资产阶级教育学者认为，人民群众对受教育是应该有份的，但是说到办教育，那就没有人民群众的份，只有专家的份。他们的口号是“教授治校”，“外行不能领导内行”，“党不懂教育”，“群众不懂教育”，“学生不能批评先生”等等。对于资产阶级教育家们所散布的这种迷信，有些同志也信以为真，忘记了我们党曾经一千次一万次被人们说成是“外行”，但是到了最后，事实都证明我们的党是比任何内行还要内行一些。我们有些同志提出了这样的主张：（一）只许国家办学，（二）只许办一种学校——全日制的普通学校。经验证明：对于这种主张，资产阶级的教育学者是很感兴趣的，因为这可以束缚住群众的手，不许他们办学。资产阶级的教育学者明白：按照这样的主张来办教育，我国要想普及中小学教育就很困难，要想普及高等教育就毫无希望，因为国家无法负担这笔庞大的经费，而且生产也会大受损失。我们共产党人与资产阶级教育学者不同。我们认为，人民群众是为了社会主义革命和社会主义建设而需要教育事业的。人民群众既然会做革命工作和建设工作，那么人民群众就不但可以受教育，而且可以办教育。办教育需要依靠专门的队伍，没有强大的专门队伍是不行的，现在还应当用调干部和办师范的办法大大增强这个专门队伍。但是，教育的专门队伍必须与群众相结合，办教育更加必须依靠群众。只有在党的领导之下，把专业的教育工作者同群众结合起来，采取从群众中来、到群众中去的群众路线，贯彻全民办学，我国的教育事业才能够而且一定能够办得又多又快又好又省。也只有在党的领导之下，贯彻全民办学，才能统筹全局，兼顾各方，协调各方，既发展了教育，又使教育的发展有利于而不是有害于生产的发展。
    我们的教育工作者还常常谈“教育工作应该受党的领导”，这无疑是正确的，因为社会主义的教育必须由共产党领导，社会主义的中华人民共和国的教育必须由中国共产党领导。但是，对于什么是领导，要什么样的领导，也有不同的理解。资产阶级教育家认为，所谓“党的领导”，就是“政治上由党领导，业务上由我领导”。在与教育无关的问题上，他们可以听党的话，但是如果党要来干涉教育的方针、政策、制度、方法等等，他们就认为是不能接受的。他们是口头上要党领导，实际上不要党领导，在次要的问题上可以听党的话，在主要的问题上与党对抗。我们党内从事教育工作的同志中，有些人对党委以专家自居，不尊重党委的领导，这是资产阶级的影响在党内的表现。近几年来，我国教育界里广泛地传播着一种“理论”，认为教育的主要规律是从教育史的研究中得出来的。因此，只要研究了教育史，并且抽象地承认党的领导，就可以办社会主义的教育了，用不着党对教育的具体领导。研究教育史，如果是用马克思历史唯物主义观点去研究的话，那当然有好处，可以知道几千年阶级社会时代教育的规律。但须知，这种阶级社会历史上教育的规律，并不等于社会主义教育的规律，更不等于中国的社会主义教育的规律。过去几千年的教育，乃是奴隶主手中的教育、地主阶级手中的教育和资产阶级手中的教育。从这样的教育史中找出来的主要规律，是剥削阶级的教育的规律。这样的教育规律，同社会主义的教育规律必然有很大的距离。如果照抄过来，必然要犯错误。实际已经证明，所谓“教育的主要规律是从教育史的研究中得出来的”，其实是借口教育史，把资产阶级的教育思想、教育政策、教育制度、教育方法等等原封不动地搬到社会主义制度下来，冒充是社会主义的货色而已。中国教育史有人民性的一面。孔子的有教无类，孟子的民贵君轻，荀子的人定胜天，屈原的批判君恶，司马迁的颂扬反抗，王充、范缜、柳宗元、张载、王夫之的古代唯物论，关汉卿、施耐庵、吴承恩、曹雪芹的民主文学，孙中山的民主革命，诸人情况不同，许多人并无教育专著，然而上举那些，不能不影响对人民的教育，谈中国教育史，应当提到他们。但是就教育史的主要侧面说来，几千年来的教育，确是剥削阶级手中的工具，而社会主义教育乃是工人阶级手中的工具。从剥削阶级手中的工具到工人阶级手中的工具，是教育的质的飞跃，是教育本身的大革命。研究教育史而看不见这个质的飞跃，就是离开了辩证法，就是形而上学。我们主张研究教育史，但是反对那种认为研究了教育史就可以得出社会主义教育的主要规律的意见，因为这个意见，会使我们犯右倾的错误。不但如此，就是社会主义教育的规律，除了有共同性以外，也在不同的国家有不同的特点。不研究自己的特点，就会犯教条主义的错误。我国的特点是什么呢？第一，我国是社会主义国家；第二，人口众多，地区辽阔；第三，经济落后，文化落后；第四，有共产党的领导和工农业生产的大跃进；第五，这是最重要的，我国是一个严肃地进行整风、反右的国家，是大鸣、大放、大争、大辩、大字报的国家。我们应当根据我国自己的特点，把马克思主义的普遍真理同我国的具体实际结合起来，来规定我国的教育方针、教育政策、教育制度、教育方法等等。由此可见，所谓“教育的主要规律是从教育史的研究中得出来的”，乃是使教育脱离实际，陷入右倾错误和教条主义错误的一种非常有害的“理论”。不从本国的客观的实际情况出发，这是主观主义的思想方法，是反马克思主义的思想方法。思想方法上犯了错误，就找不到事物发展的主要规律。只要不从实际出发，违背了马克思主义的普遍真理，就一定犯错误，不是犯右倾的错误，就是犯教条主义的错误，或者两种错误兼而有之，这是在我国教育工作中应当得出的重要教训。我们是马克思主义者，我们主张必须从客观的实际情况出发，因此必须首先认真地研究自己的情况，必须有热情来做这种研究工作。我们也认真研究兄弟国家的经验和认真研究历史，但目的不是去抄袭，去搬运，而是为了了解历史情况，了解教育方面的历史唯物主义，以便有所借鉴，依照自己的情况，做好自己的工作。我们不论做什么工作，都要紧紧依靠党的领导，因为正是共产党而不是别人，最了解我们自己的情况，最懂得马克思主义。共产党是工人阶级的最高组织形式，共产党必须而且能够领导一切。共产党从中央到基层组织，是工人阶级的有组织有纪律的先锋队伍。我们依靠这个队伍取得革命战争的胜利，依靠这个队伍取得经济战线、政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命的胜利，也必须依靠这个队伍才能取得技术革命和文化革命的胜利。我们的教育工作者，不仅在政治上应该接受党的领导，而且在教育思想、教育政策、教育业务等方面也应该接受党的领导，才能不落后于时代，才能少犯错误和不犯错误。
    几年来教育工作中的争论，归根到底，集中地表现在“什么是全面发展”这个问题上面。“培养全面发展的人类”，是马克思主义者所主张的，马克思主义者主张经过教育来达到这个目的。我们的教育工作者，常常谈全面发展，这是好的。但是，对于“全面发展”的理解，却有原则的分歧。从我国九年的教育工作的经验来看，资产阶级教育学者并不直接地公开地反对全面发展，他们甚至似乎是“积极拥护”这个方针的，但是他们主张把全面发展片面地了解为使学生具有广博的书本知识，同时却既不主张学生学习政治，又不主张学生参加生产劳动。这就实际上把全面发展庸俗化，使它等同于资产阶级的所谓培养“通才”的教育方针。我们共产党人，对于全面发展的了解，同资产阶级教育学者的了解是根本不同的。全面发展，包含着这样一个根本内容，就是使学生们有比较广博的知识，成为多面手，能够“根据社会的需要或他们自己的爱好，轮流从一个生产部门转到另一个生产部门”。（恩格斯：“共产主义原理”）我们主张工人在工业生产中成为多面手，农民在农业生产中成为多面手，并且主张工人兼农民，农民兼工人，主张公民服兵役，军人退伍又成为生产者，主张干部参加劳动，生产者参加管理，这些主张已经在逐步实行。这种既有分工又能转业的办法，适合于社会的需要，比资本主义制度下的分工合理得多，不仅增加了生产，而且在社会发生某种需要的时候，国家可以合理地调配生产力而不会引起社会的震动。我国工农业生产的大跃进，现在已经开始提出这样的问题：当某些产品达到了可以满足现时期人民的最高限度的需要而有余的时候，生产这些产品的一部分生产者就应当转业，转到另外的生产部门去，到那时，不转移就不合人民的需要，不合社会生产力继续发展和人民生活继续提高的需要。我们的教育工作和国家的其他有关工作必须为这种转移准备条件。教育应该使学生得到广博的知识，但是广博到什么程度，就要看具体的客观条件和主观条件。将来，在完全巩固、完全发展、完全成熟的共产主义社会，将要培养出能够作很多事情，能够担任很多职业但是又有重点知识能力的人。这是我们的方向，我们必须向这个方向走去。在当前我国的条件下，我们能够培养多面手，还不能培养出“能够担任任何职业的人”。全面发展所包含的另一个根本的内容，是学生所学到的知识，须是比较完全的知识，而不是片面性的不完全的知识。这就必须实行教育为政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合。马克思对于他所理想的未来教育说：“这种教育使每一个已达一定年龄的儿童，都把生产劳动和智育体育结合起来，这不仅是增加社会生产的一个方法，并且是培养全面发展的人类的唯一方法。”（“资本论”第一卷）这就是说，要求学生学到比较完全的知识，不但能够用脑来劳动，而且还能够用手来劳动。仅仅有书本知识，不论怎样广博，还是片面性的不完全的知识。没有实际工作经验而只有很多书本知识的人，只是资产阶级的所谓“通才”，并不是我们所称的全面发展的人。儿童时期需要发展身体，这种发展要是健全的。儿童时期需要发展共产主义的情操、风格和集体英雄主义的气概，就是我们时代的德育。这二者同智育是连结一道的。二者都同从事劳动有关，所以教育与劳动结合的原则是不可移易的。总结以上所说，我们所主张的全面发展，是要使学生得到比较完全的和比较广博的知识，发展健全的身体，发展共产主义的道德。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中说：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”这就是全面发展的教育方针。“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”，就是既懂政治，又有文化，既能从事脑力劳动，又能从事体力劳动的人。这就是全面发展的人，就是又红又专的人，就是工人化的知识分子，就是知识分子化的工人。
    我们主张全面发展的教育方针，我们认为培养全面发展的人类的唯一方法，是教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合。我们说“唯一方法”，就是说除此以外再没有别的方法。资产阶级的教育学者不然，他们认为，要培养出他们的所谓“全面发展”的人，唯一方法是读书，是死记书本，他们千方百计反对学生学政治，尤其反对学生成为劳动者。依照我们的全面发展的教育方针，就可以而且应该依靠群众来办学。依照资产阶级的所谓“全面发展”的教育方针，就只能依靠专家办学，不能依靠人民群众办学。依照我们的全面发展的教育方针，教育应该受党的领导。依照资产阶级的所谓“全面发展”的方针，教育只能由专家领导，用不着党的领导，因为党是“外行”。由此可见，对于全面发展的不同理解，就得出一系列的不同的以至相反的论点。所以我们说，几年来教育工作中的争论，归根结底，集中地表现在“什么是全面发展”这个问题上面。这个斗争的性质，是无产阶级和资产阶级两种教育思想之间的斗争。
    按照我国资产阶级教育学者对于知识、对于教育是人民的事业、对于党的领导和对于全面发展的理解办事，我们的教育就要回到资产阶级的老路上去。正因为如此，所以必须把我们共产党人对于这些问题的理解，说个明白。
    中华人民共和国成立九年以来，我国的教育工作，在中国共产党的领导之下，取得了巨大的成绩。这些成绩是：从帝国主义者手里收回了教育主权；妥善地接收了全国的学校；取消了国民党反动派对学校的法西斯管理制度和对学生的法西斯教育和特务统治；建立起社会主义的教育制度；基本上肃清了隐藏在教育界的反革命分子和其他坏分子；在学校里开设了马克思列宁主义的课程；在教师和学生中进行了思想改造；进行了院系调整和教学改革；进行了反对资产阶级右派的斗争；高等学校、中等学校和小学的在校学生都增加几倍；扫盲运动和业余的文化技术教育有了很大的发展；在学校中开始普遍地实行了勤工俭学；在教育工作者的队伍中建立了党的组织；为社会主义建设培养了大量的干部。但是，在教育工作这条战线上，工人阶级思想同资产阶级思想之间的斗争是不断地进行着的。这个斗争，按其性质来说，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路之间的斗争。资产阶级思想，阻碍着教育的发展。资产阶级右派，在它猖狂进攻的时候，甚至企图利用学生做资本主义复辟的踏脚石，当时章伯钧、罗隆基、曾昭抡、钱伟长等都是这样梦想过的。反右派斗争的胜利，工农业生产的大跃进，使坏事变为好事，人们比较深刻地认识了教育工作中资产阶级思想的危险和害处。九年的工作，使我们得到了经验，有可能来更加明确地和系统地阐明党的教育工作方针。
    教育工作中主要的错误和缺点，是教育脱离生产劳动。教育要与生产劳动相结合，是我们党在1934年就已经提出的方针。当时毛泽东同志就已经说：“苏维埃文化教育的总方针在什么地方呢？在于以共产主义的精神来教育广大的劳苦民众，在于使文化教育为革命战争与阶级斗争服务，在于使教育与劳动联系起来，在于使广大中国民众都成为享受文明幸福的人。”1954年，当经济恢复的时期已经过去，第一个五年计划已经开始的时候，党中央又曾经提出过在学校里增设生产劳动的课程问题。但是遇到一些阻碍，没有能够贯彻。1957年3月的全国宣传工作会议，同年4月8日“人民日报”的社论，1958年1月的南宁会议，党中央屡次强调了教育必须与生产劳动结合的主张。直到现在，党的主张才在全国范围内实现了。教育为政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合，教育必须由党来领导，这三者是互相联系的。教育既然脱离生产劳动，就必然在一定程度上忽视政治和忽视党的领导。这样，教育就脱离我国的实际，势必发生右倾的和教条主义的错误。
    教育与生产劳动结合，是社会主义革命所需要的，是社会主义建设所需要的，是建设共产主义社会的远大目标所需要的，是多快好省地发展教育事业所需要的。
    社会主义革命，是要消灭一切剥削阶级和一切剥削制度及其残余。现在，社会主义革命在经济战线上已经取得了基本胜利，在政治战线和思想战线上已经取得了决定性的胜利。我们的任务，如中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第二次会议决议所指出的，是“在继续进行经济战线，政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的同时，积极地进行技术革命和文化革命”。文化革命，就是使我国六亿人口，除了不能生产和不能学习的以外，人人都生产，人人都学习。就是使我国工农群众知识化，同时使我国知识分子劳动化。工农群众和知识分子双方各向自己缺乏的方面发展，才能彻底改变旧社会遗留下来不合理的情况，消灭两方面的落后现象，即消灭工农群众缺乏文化的现象，也消灭知识分子中的资产阶级思想。所以这是一个极其深刻的革命，这个革命要求教育为工人阶级的政治服务，要求教育与生产劳动相结合。马克思说过：“生产劳动和教育的早期结合是改造现代社会的最强有力的手段之一。”（“哥达纲领批判”）没有教育与生产劳动的结合，文化革命不能实现。文化革命，对于我们的国家，对于工农群众，对于知识分子，都是有利的。只有坚持资产阶级立场的人们，才不愿意有这样的革命。资产阶级的教育方针，为教育而教育的方针，劳心与劳力分离的方针，是同社会主义革命不相容的。
    社会主义建设，要求鼓足干劲、力争上游，要求实行勤俭建国，也要求技术和文化，要求多快好省地培养出大批的又红又专的技术人才。为了满足社会主义建设的这个需要，也要实行教育与生产劳动相结合。列宁说过：“如果不把青年一代的教学和生产劳动结合起来，未来社会的理想是不能想像的；我们不可能把脱离生产劳动的教学和教育或者把脱离相应的教学和教育的生产劳动，提到现代技术水平和科学知识现状所要求的那种高度。”（“民粹派空洞计划的典型”，载“教育译报”1956年第六期）教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，必然提高教育的质量，不仅仅在智育方面是如此，在德育、体育方面也是如此。劳心与劳力分离的教育方针，不能适合社会主义建设的需要。
    将来的共产主义社会，是各尽所能，各取所需的社会，又是消灭了城市与乡村之间的差别的，消灭了脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别的社会。由于我国的工农业生产的大跃进，共产主义的实现已经不是很远的远景了。为了实现共产主义社会，马克思和恩格斯在一百一十年前写的“共产党宣言”里，提出了“在各个先进的国度里几乎到处可以采取”的十条办法，其中第一条到第八条，在我国已经采取适合于我国实际情况的方法实现了，第九第十两条，则正在开始实现，这就是：“将农业同工业结合起来，促使城乡对立状态逐渐消灭”；“将教育同物质生产结合起来”。大家看到，由于我国在发展工业的工作中，采取了“在重工业优先发展的条件下，工业和农业同时并举；在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举”的方针，乡村中也出现了工业，出现了工人兼农民和农民兼工人的现象。这种现象，是共产主义社会的萌芽。由于开始实行了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，学校办了工厂农场，工厂和农业合作社办了许多学校，开始出现了学生即工人农民，工人农民即学生的现象。这种现象，也是共产主义社会的萌芽。可以设想，我国进入共产主义社会的时候，我们的社会的基层组织将是许多共产主义的公社。除了少数例外，每个基层单位将是工农商学兵行行俱全。在教育方面来说，每个基层单位将有自己的初等学校、中等学校和高等学校；同时，每个人将都有时间来受教育，既是劳动者又是知识分子。恩格斯在“论住宅问题”中曾经预言这种情形说：“正是由于有了这种工业革命，人的劳动生产力方才达到了这样的高度，以致在人类历史上破天荒第一次有了可能在大家合理分工的条件下，不仅生产出充分的物品来满足一切社会成员的大量消费和造成丰富的后备储藏，而且使每个人都有充分的闲暇时间，可以从历史上留传下来的文化——科学、艺术、公共生活方式等等——中间承受一切真正有价值的东西，并且不仅承受而已，还要把这一切从统治阶级的独占品变成全社会的公有物，促使其进一步地发展。”为了实现这种前景，我们的教育，就不应该向着劳心与劳力分离的方向走，而应该向着脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合、教育与生产劳动相结合的方向走。
    多快好省地发展教育，在资产阶级的教育家看来是不可能的。今年年初以来教育事业的大发展，证明了采取群众路线来办教育，就可以使教育事业多快好省地发展。而实行教育与劳动结合，使教育成为工人农民所热烈欢迎的事业，是发动群众的办学积极性的重要方法。在党的领导下群众路线的办学方针就是：第一，统一性与多样性相结合。培养目标是统一的，即培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，但中央、地方，与厂矿、企业、农业合作社都可以办学，学校的形式应该允许多种多样。学校可以是全日制的、半工半读的、或者业余学习的，可以是免费的或者是收费的。现在的业余学校，在生产更加发展，工作时间可以缩短的情况下，将变为同半工半读的学校一样。在生产大大发展，公共积累大大增加的情况下，收费的学校也将变为免费的学校。第二，普及与提高相结合，在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及。一部分全日制的、半工半读的和业余的学校担任提高的任务，同时用半工半读和业余学习的形式广泛地普及教育。这种用来普及教育的学校，因为是半工半读的和业余的，可以全部或大部解决自己的经费，可以按照“能者为师”的原则就地找到师资，然后在政府的帮助之下，逐渐发展成为在课程、设备、师资等方面日益完备的学校。在缺乏劳动的学校里，要强调增设劳动课程，在缺乏基础课程的学校里，要强调增设基础课程，使两种学校都向自己缺乏的方面发展，更好地实现理论与实际结合的原则。第三，全面规划与地方分权相结合，既发挥中央各部门的积极性，又发挥地方的和群众的积极性，以便多快好省地发展教育。全国和地方在规划教育工作的时候，因为有党委的领导，可以使教育得到最快的发展，同时又使教育的发展有利于生产的发展，而不是妨碍生产的发展。第四，群众路线也应该贯彻到学校的政治工作、管理工作、教学工作和研究工作中去，在这些工作中采取大鸣、大放、大字报的方法，采取党委领导下的“三结合”的方法（例如制定教学计划和教学大纲的时候可以采取在党委领导下师生结合的方法，讲授课程的时候可以采取党委领导下聘请有实际经验的人同专业教师共同授课的方法等等），以及在领导者与被领导者之间，在教师与学生之间，建立民主的平等的关系，改变旧的不合理的关系。经验已经开始证明，凡是实行了这些办法的地方，都得了很显著的成绩。
    实现教育与劳动结合，必须经过斗争，而且将会有长期的斗争。为什么呢？因为这是教育工作中反对几千年的旧传统的一个革命。劳心与劳力分离的原则，在教育工作中已经统治了几千年。历史上的一切剥削阶级，都坚持这个原则。二千多年以前，孔子就反对教育与生产劳动相结合，他把“请学稼”“请学为圃”的樊迟斥为“小人”。孟子反对许行，说“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人，治于人者食人，治人者食于人，天下之通理也”。（食，读作饲。）资产阶级的教育学家们，在这一点上，同孔孟是完全一致的。教育原来是同生产劳动结合的，在阶级社会里二者分离了，现在又要结合起来。十八世纪的空想社会主义者傅利叶和欧文，开始提出教育与生产劳动相结合的思想。马克思、恩格斯、列宁都赞成这个思想。马克思在“资本论”第一卷里，认为半工半读比全日制的学校更适合于儿童。在“给临时中央委员会代表的关于几个问题的指示”中，马克思提出“在合理的社会制度下，每个儿童从九岁起都应当成为生产工作者”；他主张九岁到十二岁的儿童应当每天在作坊或家庭中劳动二小时，十三岁到十五岁的儿童劳动四小时，十六岁到十七岁的儿童劳动六小时；他相信“把有报酬的生产劳动、智育、体育和综合技术教育结合起来，就能把工人阶级提高到比中、上等阶级高得多的水平。”马克思曾经预言道：“没有疑问，工人阶级在不可避免地夺得政权以后，还会在理论方面和实用方面，使工艺教育在工人学校内占得地位。”（“资本论”第一卷）只有在工人阶级和共产党领导的社会主义的国家里，教育与生产劳动相结合的原则，才会被付之实施，在革命和建设中发生巨大的作用。马克思的预言，将在我国实现。我们必须看到，实行教育与生产劳动相结合，是同几千年的旧传统进行决斗，没有破除迷信、埋葬教条主义、敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，没有以马克思主义的普遍真理和我国具体实际相结合的创造精神，是不会成功的。现在，在教育工作中，正在进行着大破大立的过程。资产阶级思想和教条主义思想正在被破除，新的适合于我国情况的马克思主义的教育学理论、教育制度、教育方法、课程、学制等等正在被创造出来。这个教育革命是有深厚的经济基础的。马克思主义的历史唯物主义的学说告诉我们，上层建筑必须适合经济基础。政治制度是上层建筑，是经济的集中表现。教育属于意识形态的范围，也是上层建筑，它是为政治服务的。过去几千年的阶级社会，是以奴隶主所有制，地主所有制和资本家所有制为经济基础的。适合于这些所有制的政治制度，是奴隶主阶级、地主阶级和资产阶级的专政。为这种专政服务的教育，是奴隶主阶级的、地主阶级的和资产阶级的教育，这些教育相互之间是有区别的，但它们有一个共同特点，就是教育与生产劳动分离、劳心与劳力分离，是贱视体力劳动和体力劳动者。劳心与劳力分离，是一切剥削阶级所需要的，也是资产阶级所需要的。我们的社会，是以社会主义的所有制为经济基础的。适合于社会主义所有制的政治制度，是无产阶级专政。我们的教育是为无产阶级专政服务的，因而我们的教育，就必须一反以往几千年的旧传统，采取教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，来消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别，这也就是消灭历史上一切剥削制度的残余，使人类进入共产主义社会。教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，是工人阶级和一切劳动人民所需要的。这个方针是符合于人民的愿望的，因此一定会胜利。反之，劳心与劳力分离的方针，既然不适合社会主义的经济基础，不符合人民的需要，虽然有几千年的传统，却迟早总要被人民唾弃。政治挂帅，在党的领导下，团结全党，团结一切可能团结的教育工作者，反对资产阶级的教育方针，为实现党的教育方针而斗争，我们就能实现我国的文化革命，使我国六亿人口人人能生产、人人能学习，变为既是劳动者又是知识分子的新人。　一九五八年八月十六日
