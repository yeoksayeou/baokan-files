To the Liberation Army Comrades on the Fujian Front:

    Hello to you, and thank you for your hard work! First, please allow us to extend our highest revolutionary salute to you and accept our heartfelt greetings from us three girls.

    In this great era when our six hundred million people are advancing towards communism with giant strides, with each day equal to twenty years, the heinous American imperialism is openly carrying out military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area. This is something that every citizen of the People's Republic of China cannot tolerate. We disagree a thousand times, ten thousand times!

    Respected comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, when we read news in the newspapers of you giving the enemy a heavy blow, we were greatly encouraged. We are now students at a normal school, and our primary task is to study. In order to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan and other islands with practical actions, we must strive to learn our major and other courses well in a peaceful environment, improve our political and professional levels, and become truly worthy people's educators. In addition, we must work hard to carry out work-study programs, do a good job in promoting various movements, and actively participate in physical exercise, striving to reach the first and second-level standards of the "Labor and Defense" system in the shortest possible time. We must also consolidate our existing military knowledge and skills so that when the motherland needs us, we can resolutely put down our books and pens, leave the classroom, grip our guns tightly, and rush to the battlefield.

    Dear comrades, although we are so far apart, our heartstrings are throbbing fiercely, and our blood is boiling, just like yours. We want to stand on the same front as you, and contribute all our strength to the prosperity and happiness of the motherland and the cause of liberation for all mankind!

    三位姑娘的心意
    福建前线解放军同志：
    您们好，您们辛苦啦！首先请允许我们向您们致以崇高的革命敬礼，请接受我们三位姑娘的衷心慰问。
    当我们祖国六亿人民正以一天等于二十年的巨人步伐，向共产主义迈进的伟大时代里，万恶滔天的美帝国主义却公然在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅，这是每个中华人民共和国的公民所不能容忍的，我们一千个不答应，一万个不允许！
    敬爱的中国人民解放军同志们，当我们从报纸上读到您们给敌人沉重打击的消息时，我们得到莫大的鼓舞。我们现在是一个师范学生，最主要的任务还是学习。为了以实际行动支援解放台湾及其他岛屿的斗争，我们要在和平的环境中，努力学好专业及其他的课程，提高政治和业务水平，做一个名副其实的人民教养员。另外，还要努力搞好勤工俭学活动，做好各项运动的宣传工作，积极参加体育锻炼，争取在最短时间内，分别达到劳卫制一级和二级标准。我们还要巩固现有的军事知识和军事技能，当祖国需要我们的时候，我们便毅然决然地放下书本和笔杆，走出课堂，握紧枪杆，奔赴战场。
    亲爱的同志们，我们虽然隔得这么遥远，但我们和您们一样，心弦在剧烈地跳着，血液在沸腾着。我们要和您们站在同一条战线上，为了祖国的繁荣幸福，为了全人类的解放事业，贡献出全部力量！
