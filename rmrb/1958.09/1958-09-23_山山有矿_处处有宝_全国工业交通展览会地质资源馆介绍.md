Mountains and Mountains Have Mines, Everywhere There Are Treasures
——An Introduction to the Geological Resources Pavilion at the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition
By our reporter Bai Sheng

    Ancient, dense forests,
    Steep, wild ridges and barren hills,
    I will, in your heart,
    Excavate the slumbering treasures,
    Let industrial flowers bloom everywhere,
    And build the motherland into a paradise on earth.
    —This is a poem written by a geological worker.

    If you want to know just how many mineral treasure mountains there are in the motherland, and what treasures they contain, then please visit the Geological Resources Pavilion at the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition recently held at the Beijing Exhibition Hall. There, you will find a magnificent world of the earth, with a dazzling array of colorful and glittering mineral gems, and a moving scene of geological exploration, with people trekking through deep mountains and wilderness, crossing mountains and ridges to seek treasures. They will give you a vivid introduction to the geological resources of the motherland.

Rich Resources

    On the vast land of our motherland, covering more than 9.6 million square kilometers, whether from the vast Gobi Desert of Xinjiang to the Sichuan Basin, or from Hainan Island with its coconut groves to the Inner Mongolian grasslands with its herds of cattle and sheep, there are footprints of people opening mountains to explore treasures. Look, the photos of the young geological exploration teams trekking in the deep mountains and wilderness of the motherland, displayed in the hall of the Geological Resources Pavilion, seem to be proudly telling you how they are exploring the secrets of the earth day and night, so that the rich natural wealth can serve the socialist industrialization of the motherland.

    However, in old China, people were once deceived by the lies of imperialism. At that time, the motherland's rich mineral resources and national sovereignty were sold to imperialism. While spreading the lies that "China is a country with a large land but few resources, poor in mineral resources," "China is poor in copper, lacks iron, has no oil, and lacks coking coal," the enemy shamelessly plundered our country's mineral resources. Under the deception of imperialism and reactionary rulers, even some Chinese geological workers once had blindly pessimistic emotions about China's geological resources. Because of this, countless treasures were suffocated underground for many years. Some coalfields burned underground for a whole century without being mined, and some minerals were eroded day and night by the endless mountains and rivers, flowing away in vain.

    Today, when the people of the motherland are building an industrialized motherland by leaps and bounds with their hardworking hands, they have also changed the backward situation of geological exploration in old China.

    When people stand in front of the charts in the Geological Resources Pavilion, densely covering the mineral resources of the motherland, and compare the past and the present, they cannot help but have many feelings. Before liberation, the underground treasures that had been sleeping in the barren mountains and wilderness for many years, were explored in just a few years after liberation, reaching seventy-one kinds, more than four times the number of mineral species explored in the fifty years of geological exploration in old China before liberation. This great achievement is just as the folk song sings:

    In the past, jackals were in power,
    Treasures in the mountains were not valued as treasures,
    Now, the Communist Party leads well,
    Even stone mountains become treasures.

    The iron ore, which American imperialism slandered as the most lacking in China, had proven reserves of 5.6 billion tons in the first Five-Year Plan, more than the total of Britain and the United States. By the end of this year, the proven reserves of iron ore will reach 13 billion tons. The "grain of industry" - coal, had proven reserves of 55 billion tons in the first Five-Year Plan, far exceeding Britain, and this year will increase to 138 billion tons. The proven reserves of other minerals such as tungsten, tin, molybdenum, manganese, aluminum, and lead have also leapt to the forefront of the world. Not only are the mineral deposits abundant, but the development of geological exploration teams after liberation is also amazing. Under the guidance of the policy of the whole party and the whole people running geology, the number of geological personnel has increased from more than 800 before liberation to 270,000, and the number of drilling rigs has increased from 14 before liberation to more than 4,600. A strong and modern geological work team is growing.

Good News from the Treasure Mountains

    This year, an extraordinary year of the Great Leap Forward, the geological work of the motherland, like other work, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest.

    When people stand in front of the huge charts and bulletin boards in the Geological Resources Pavilion, looking at the good news from the treasure mountains that are constantly coming in the Great Leap Forward, they are truly filled with indescribable excitement. In the short months of the Great Leap Forward, 61 various large mining areas have been found throughout the country. These mining areas all have very rich future reserves. Look, the Qilian Mountains, known as the Urals of China, have recently discovered a large copper mine that is rare in the world. Within a range of 50 kilometers long and 10 kilometers wide, preliminary exploration has confirmed that this ore belt not only has very rich future reserves of copper, but also discovered nickel ore and other metals that the country urgently needs. The world's rare large asbestos mine was also discovered in Sichuan during the Great Leap Forward. The pure asbestos reserves contained in this asbestos mine are very large. Not only is the quality of asbestos good and the fibers long, but the ore deposit is concentrated and can be mined in the open air. In the past, the British collected asbestos that was 108 centimeters long and considered it a "rare treasure" and displayed it in the "British Museum," but in our large asbestos mine, there is asbestos that is 150 to 180 centimeters long. Jiangxi, which has always been considered a region lacking iron, discovered a huge iron ore deposit in the Great Leap Forward, discovered by a student from a technical secondary school in the area spanning five counties including Xinyu. Its reserves are 7 billion tons, equivalent to twice the iron reserves of the entire United Kingdom. If a steel plant with an annual output of 30 million tons of steel is built here, it can produce for 50 to 60 years! During the Great Leap Forward, treasure mountains blossomed everywhere, and new discoveries came one after another. The huge chromite ore discovered in the Inner Mongolian grasslands, the world-scale large copper mine discovered in Zhejiang, the nickel mine discovered in Yunnan, the large iron mine discovered in Mianchi, Henan, and the huge oil shale deposit discovered in Heilongjiang... are truly too numerous to count. The discovery of these underground treasures has prepared rich resources for the high-speed development of the country's industry and agriculture.

The People Who Find Mines

    People often view geological work as very mysterious, thinking that only those who study geology can discover the treasures of mines. But what is the fact! Many famous large mining areas were reported by geological "militia" - ordinary people's surveys. These ordinary mine finders from the masses have brought geological work from a narrow world to a broad road of development.

    From the many moving pictures of mine finding displayed in the Geological Resources Pavilion, we can see many vivid examples of the masses finding and reporting mines.

    In Dengfeng County, at the foot of Mount Song in Henan, the villagers used to describe their life before liberation by saying "Living in a treasure mountain but not seeing the treasure, being poor all year round." This is a mountainous area rich in mineral resources but undeveloped. In the Great Leap Forward, the people here proposed the bold statement "One axe splits the top of Mount Song, gold, silver, copper, and iron flow out," and organized a 70-person geological survey team. In three months, they found more than 70 mining points. They learned from Li Ming, an old farmer with more than 30 years of rich mine-finding experience in the local area, and mastered the rules for finding Shanxi-style iron ore. Old farmer Li Ming was not only familiar with the surrounding mountain shapes and terrain, but also compiled the mine-finding rules he mastered into a song:

    Coal in the front mountain, ore in the back mountain,
    Bluestone blocking the head, iron-aluminum stone nourishes the ore,
    Don't worry about encountering green stone,
    It's not accurate without leaving the bluestone.

    This song fully illustrates the rich experience of this local expert in finding mines. It not only conforms to the principles of geological science, but also shows that geological work is not mysterious.

Leap Forward in Exploration Technology

    In the past, geological workers only had simple exploration tools such as compasses, hammers, and magnifying glasses for fieldwork. They often used the two sentences "No people are seen in the empty mountains, only the sound of hammers is heard" to describe the lonely and desolate scene when they worked. But now, people can see from the actual objects of various drilling tools exhibited in the Geological Resources Pavilion, and the vivid photos of field geological exploration, that not only is the young geological exploration team trekking in the barren mountains and wilderness growing day by day, but the roaring sound of drilling rigs has been heard everywhere day and night in the deep mountains. When people gaze at the scene when our ancestors began to use drilling to extract brine from the ground 2,200 years ago, and then look forward to the heroic posture of the geological vanguard team of the motherland armed with modern geophysical exploration, geochemical exploration, and aerial exploration in the vast valleys and wilderness today, they have infinite feelings. Today, barren mountains and wilderness are becoming a source of industry.

    People are encouraged by the rapid efficiency of the new, faster, better, and more economical exploration technology. Look, the newly discovered 7 billion-ton iron ore in Xinyu, Jiangxi, is surrounded by more than 100 square kilometers, with high mountains and dense forests, and the ground exploration work is so arduous. But with aerial exploration, only one plane working for one day can complete all the exploration.

    People are also amazed at the rapid increase in the efficiency of drilling rigs. The drilling rigs that only drilled 95 meters per unit in 1955 had risen to 176 meters by 1957. In the high tide of this year's Great Leap Forward, due to the liberation of the minds of the drilling rig masters, the average drilling efficiency per unit has jumped to 281 meters, and there are also 71 advanced drilling rigs that have broken through 1,000 meters per month, with the highest drilling record reaching 2,415 meters.

Best wishes to you, the agile geological pioneers

    When you are about to walk out of the hall of the Geological Resources Pavilion with excitement, there is still an exhibit that makes you linger: "Plant the red flag all over the periodic table of chemical elements in 1958!" What an encouraging battle cry. Of the 102 elements that have now been discovered in the world's periodic table of elements, 77 elements require geological exploration to determine industrial reserves. Among these elements, the most important part is non-ferrous metals, rare metals, and dispersed elements. These elements are closely related to the latest scientific and technological electronic industry, atomic industry, aviation industry, and mechanical industry. At present, there are only ten elements in our country that have not yet proven reserves. In the face of the great leap forward in geological work, planting the red flag all over the periodic table of elements this year is a completely achievable combat goal.

    Let us wish the agile geological exploration teams active in the mountains, plains, forests, and coasts of the motherland, to explore the endless and rich treasures of the motherland underground with your diligent and intelligent hands and minds! Let the rocks reveal the truth, let the mineral deposits open their doors, and the high-speed development of the motherland's industry and agriculture is waiting for your brilliant contributions!

    山山有矿  处处有宝
    ——全国工业交通展览会地质资源馆介绍
    本者报记　柏生
    古老的密茂森林，
    陡峻的野岭荒岗，
    我要在你的心腹中，
    发掘出沉睡的宝藏，
    让工业之花遍地开放，
    把祖国建设成人间天堂。
    ——这是一个地质工作者写的诗。
    如果你想知道祖国的矿产宝山到底有多少，那里蕴藏着什么宝，那么，请你到最近在北京展览馆举行的全国工业交通展览会的地质资源馆去看看，那里是一个绚烂的大地世界，有着满目琳琅、丰富多采、闪闪发光的五光十色的矿山宝石，和踏遍深山旷野，翻山越岭探宝的一片动人的地质勘探情景。它们会向你作一次生动的祖国地质资源的介绍。
    富饶的资源
    在我们祖国九百六十多万平方公里的辽阔土地上，无论是从新疆的大戈壁滩到巴蜀盆地，还是从椰林深处的海南岛到牛羊成群的内蒙古草原，到处都有开山探宝人们的足迹。你看，那陈列在地质资源馆大厅里的，一幅幅跋涉在祖国深山荒野里的年轻的地质勘探队伍的照片，仿佛在向你骄傲地诉说着他们如何夜以继日地探寻着大地的秘密，让那富饶的大自然财富为祖国的社会主义工业化服务。
    然而，在旧中国，人们却曾经被帝国主义的谎言谰语所欺骗。那时，祖国富饶的矿产资源和国家主权一起被出卖给帝国主义。敌人一面散布着“中国是个地大物不博，矿产资源贫乏的国家”，“中国贫铜、缺铁、无油，又少炼焦煤”的谎言，一面却又无耻地掠夺着我国的矿产资源。在帝国主义和反动统治者的愚弄下，甚至中国的一些地质工作者，对中国的地质资源也曾经有过盲目悲观的情绪。正是这样，无数的宝藏就长年被窒息在地下，有的煤田整整在地下燃烧了一个世纪得不到开采，有的矿产被长年不息的山水日夜冲击，白白地流散。
    今天，当祖国人民用勤劳的双手，飞跃地建设工业化的祖国的时候，她使旧中国地质勘探的落后面貌也获得了改变。
    当人们站在地质资源馆的一幅幅密布祖国矿产资源的图表前，对比着今昔的景况，不禁会有许多感触。解放前，那长年沉睡在荒山原野里的地下宝藏，仅仅在解放后短短的几年，就已经勘探出了七十一种，超过了解放前旧中国五十年地质勘探矿种的四倍。这巨大的成就正如民谣里所歌唱的：
    过去豺狼当道，
    山中有宝不当宝，
    如今，共产党领导好，
    石山也成宝。
    曾被美帝国主义污为中国最缺乏的铁矿，在第一个五年计划中探明的储量就已有五十六亿吨，它比英、美两国的总和还要多，到今年年底铁矿探明储量将达到一百三十亿吨。工业的粮食——煤，在第一个五年计划中，已探明的储量达五百五十亿吨，远远超过了英国，而今年还将增加到一千三百八十亿吨。其它像钨、锡、钼、锰、铝、铅等矿产已探明的储量也已跃居世界最前列。不光是矿产蕴藏的丰富，解放后地质勘探队伍的发展也是惊人的。在全党全民办地质的方针指导下，地质人员已经由解放前的八百多人增加到二十七万人，钻机由解放前的十四台增加到四千六百多台。一支强大的现代化地质工作队正在成长。
    宝山里传出的捷报
  今年，不寻常的大跃进的一年，祖国的地质工作和其他工作一样，更是取得了空前的大丰收。
    当人们伫立在地质资源馆的巨幅图表和报喜台前，望着那大跃进中不断传来的宝山捷报，真有说不出的兴奋。在短短几个月的大跃进中，全国找到各种大矿区六十一个。这些矿区都是远景储量十分丰富。看，那誉为中国乌拉尔的祁连山，最近发现了一个世界少见的大铜矿。在长达五十公里、宽十公里的范围内，初步探明，这一矿带不仅铜的远景储量十分丰富，同时还发现了国家最急需的镍矿和其他金属。那世界上罕见的大石棉矿，也在大跃进中在四川发现了。这个石棉矿蕴藏的纯石棉储量很大，不仅石棉质量好，纤维长，而且矿床集中，可以露天开采，过去英国人收藏到一百零八公分长的石棉，就认为是“稀世之珍”，把它陈列在“大英博物馆”里，而在我们的这个大石棉矿里，却有长达一百五十到一百八十多公分的石棉。那一向被人认为缺铁地区的江西，在大跃进中，一个中等技术学校的学生在跨新余等五个县的地带，发现了一个巨大的铁矿，它的储量有七十亿吨，相当于英国全国铁的储量的两倍大。如果在这里建设一个年产钢三千万吨的钢铁厂，可以生产五十年到六十年呢！大跃进中，宝山处处开了花，新的发现一个接着一个。那从内蒙古草原上发现的巨大的铬铁矿，浙江发现的具有世界规模的大铜矿，云南发现的镍矿，河南渑池发现的大铁矿，以及黑龙江发现的巨大的油页岩矿床，……真是数也数不完。这些地下宝藏的发现，为祖国工农业高速度发展准备了丰富的资源。
    找矿的人
    人们常常把地质工作看得很神秘，以为只有学地质的人才能发现矿山之宝。而事实呢！许多著名的大矿区都是地质的“民兵”——普通的群众勘查报来的。这些来自群众中的普通找矿人，把地质工作从狭小的天地带向了广阔的发展道路。
    从地质资源馆展出的许多幅动人的找矿图景中，我们可以看到群众找矿报矿的许多生动事例。
    在河南嵩山脚下的登封县，过去老乡们常用“住在宝山不见宝，终年穷得受不了”来形容解放前的生活。这里是一个矿产丰富而未经开发的山区。在大跃进中，这里的人们提出了“一斧劈开嵩山顶，金银铜铁往外流”的壮语，组织了一支七十人的地质普查队，在三个月中，就找到了矿点七十多处。他们向当地有着三十多年丰富找矿经验的老农李明学习，掌握了找山西式铁矿的规律。老农李明不仅熟悉附近的山形地势，而且把掌握的找矿规律编成了歌唱道：
    前山煤，后山矿，
    青石拦头，铁铝石养矿，
    遇见口青不要紧，
    离了青石也不准。
    这首歌充分说明了这个土专家找矿的丰富经验，不仅符合地质科学的原理，也说明了地质工作并不神秘。
    探矿技术在飞跃
    过去，地质工作者在野外工作，只有罗盘、铁锤、放大镜等简陋的勘探工具，他们常常用“空山不见人，但闻锤声响”这两句话来形容自己工作时的寂寞荒凉的情景。但是现在，人们从地质资源馆展出的各种钻探工具的实物，和野外地质勘探的一幅幅生动的照片中，可以看到不仅跋涉在荒山野岭中的年轻地质勘探队伍一天天地壮大起来，深山里日夜不停地到处都已响起了钻机轰鸣的马达声。当人们凝视着那二千二百年以前，我们的祖先就开始利用钻探来从地下汲取卤水时的情景，再展望着今天辽阔的山谷旷野上那一支支已经用现代化的地球物理探矿、地球化学探矿以及航空探矿武装起来的祖国地质尖兵队的英姿，真有无限的感触。如今，荒山野岭已经在变成一个个工业的开源地。
    人们为那新式的多快好省的探矿技术的神速效率所鼓舞。你看，那江西新余新发现的七十亿吨的大铁矿，周围达一百多平方公里，山高林密，地面勘查工作多么艰巨，可是用航空勘查，只用一架飞机工作上一天，就可以全部勘查完毕。
    人们也惊叹着钻机的效率的飞速提高，那在1955年每台还只钻探九十五公尺的钻机，到1957年已经上升到一百七十六公尺，而今年大跃进的高潮中，由于钻机主人的思想解放，每台钻机平均钻探的效率已经跃进到二百八十一公尺了，还有七十一台每月突破一千公尺的先进钻机，最高钻探纪录已达二千四百一十五公尺。预祝你，矫健的地质尖兵
    当你满怀着激动的心情，就要走出地质资源馆的大厅时，迎面还有一件展品令你久久神往：“1958年把红旗插遍化学元素周期表！”这是多么鼓舞人心的一个战斗口号。在世界元素周期表中，现在已发现的一百零二个元素中，有七十七个元素都需要进行地质勘探工作，才能探明工业储量。而这些元素中，最重要的一部分是有色金属、稀有金属和分散元素。这些元素和最新科学技术的电子工业、原子工业、航空工业，以及机械工业都有着密切的关系。目前，在我们祖国的土地上还只有十个元素未探明储量。在地质工作大跃进面前，今年内把红旗插遍元素周期表，是完全可以实现的战斗目标。
    让我们预祝那活跃在祖国深山、原野、森林、海岸上的一支支矫健的地质勘探大队，用你们勤劳、智慧的手脑，把祖国地下无尽富饶的宝藏一一探索出来吧！让岩石吐露真情，让矿藏敞开大门，祖国工农业的高速发展，在等待着你们辉煌的贡献！
