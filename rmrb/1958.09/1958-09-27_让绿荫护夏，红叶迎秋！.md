Let Green Shade Protect Summer, Red Leaves Welcome Autumn!
Lin Bister of Forestry Liang Xi

　　The term "greening" is so beautiful. When the mountains are green, the water will also be green, and when the water is green, the Yellow Sea, where all the waters converge, may gradually turn into a blue sea. In this way, green mountains and clear waters will weave a jade-colored pattern on the motherland's land. This kind of beautiful scenery was just an ideal in people's minds in old China, but it can be realized in New China in the not-too-distant future.

　　The great Agricultural Development Program and the socialist general line have set off a nationwide upsurge in greening the motherland. Not to mention planting trees around the "four sides" (houses, villages, roads, and waterways), just the afforestation of barren mountains and wastelands has reached more than 320 million mu in the first half of this year, which is equivalent to seventy times the total afforestation area in old China from 1911 to 1946.

　　Today, we must re-evaluate to what extent the twelve-year greening plan will reach? That is, how can it be called greening? Regarding this issue, our previous plan was conservative. In the past, we had concerns about remote mountains with sparse populations, concerns about barren rocky mountains, and we didn't even mention large areas of desert.

　　Greening is a national affair, and greening is everyone's affair. The people have the necessity to green all of China, the people also have the ability to green all of China, and the people have an even more urgent desire to green all of China. Under such superior conditions, under such great human power, we must re-evaluate the possibility of greening.

　　Can remote mountains be greened? Yes. The courage of the afforestation expedition teams in Huitong and Leiyang counties in Hunan Province, who brought food and tools to the mountains to fight, the vigor of more than 800,000 field troops in Guizhou Province, who camped on barren mountains and fought hard, and the communist spirit of assistance of more than 1.5 million people in the plains and semi-mountainous areas of Hebei Province, who brought seeds and seedlings to support afforestation in mountainous areas without compensation, cannot be stopped by distance. As long as the people are determined to conquer barren mountains, they can go to the ends of the earth. It can be said that greening reaches "everywhere, without exception."

　　Can rocky mountains be greened? Yes. Caihong Cooperative in Guiyang Township, Qidong County, Hunan Province, mobilized more than 300 people this spring to fight against rocky mountains for two months, opening mountains and digging holes, and transporting soil to create forests, finally dressing more than 1,000 mu of purple shale in green clothes. Under the encouragement of Caihong Cooperative, Qidong County chiseled rocks to create forests on more than 20,000 mu. The masses said: "The stone is hard, but not as hard as our determination; the mountain is high, but not as high as our ambition."

　　Can deserts be greened? Under the superior conditions of socialism, we have no reason to say no. In the eight years since liberation, my country has transformed 30 million mu of sandy wasteland. The "Great Green Wall" originally planned to be built in ten years in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province completed 67% of the afforestation area this spring alone. In mid-July, the Yulin area of Shaanxi Province successfully sowed 190,000 mu of Artemisia arenaria on the edge of the Ikezhao League desert at a distance of five to twenty kilometers by airplane. These facts have strengthened our confidence in transforming the desert. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party, the desert can be turned into an oasis.

　　In addition to the above issues, there are two other issues worth noting: one is the greening problem in large plain areas, such as Hebei and Henan provinces. People climb high on the Beijing-Hankou Railway and look into the distance. It is boundless, and the eyesight can reach directly to the foothills of the Taihang Mountains, which is too open. Now that the food problem has been solved, can each special zone and county set a standard for forest cover and create clusters or strips of forests to separate the large plains everywhere? This can increase rainfall, reduce drought, and regulate the climate, which is beneficial to farmland and hygiene. Another issue is the soil erosion area in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Can we abandon steep slopes for afforestation under the premise that food production can only increase and not decrease, and put funds, labor, and machinery on flatter mountain fields to strive to increase yield per unit area and reach or exceed the 400-jin target designated in the Agricultural Development Program?

　　The above all talk about afforestation. Does afforestation mean that the forestry work is complete? No. There is still a lot of work to be done later, especially nurturing. First, areas that are too sparse should be made denser. In addition to replanting dead seedlings in newly planted young forests, pine forests in some southern provinces were planted very sparsely at the time, and later excessive pruning was carried out, so that the crowns of the trees are not close to each other, which can neither maintain water and soil nor provide straight timber. These forest lands should be greatly replanted. The slogan of nurturing in Guizhou Province is very correct, called "replace one tree if one is missing, replace one area if one area is missing." Second, areas that are too dense should be thinned. Many mountain closure afforestation areas and young forest areas should be thinned regularly to promote the growth of dominant trees. Third, forest land with moderate density is even more valuable for nurturing. After the discovery of high-yield Chinese fir forests with a reserve of more than 1,000 cubic meters per hectare in Xihou Township, Nanping, Fujian, it attracted national attention. Everyone is studying how to further increase it to 3,000, 5,000, or even more than 6,000 cubic meters per hectare. After the discovery of fast-growing Chinese fir forests that mature in eighteen years in Jinping County, Guizhou Province (referred to as "Eighteen Fir," and so on), it aroused competition from all parties. Liping County proposed "Fifteen Fir," Jianhe County proposed "Eight Fir," and Wanfeng Cooperative in Jinping County even proposed "Six Fir." High yield and fast growth depend on cultivation and nurturing.

　　Forestry work is endless. Greening should be done so that cultivation is agronomic and nurturing is horticultural; greening should be done so that wood is inexhaustible, fruits are endless, and mulberry tea cannot be picked up; greening should be done so that factories are like gardens, cities are like parks, and villages are like forest parks; greening should be done so that green shade protects summer and red leaves welcome autumn. The mountains of Beijing should all become Fragrant Hills; the mountains of Anhui should all become Yellow Mountains; the mountains of Jiangxi should all become Mount Lu; each region should transform nature according to its favorite scenic spots. In this way, China's 9.5 million square kilometers of land will all become a large park, and everyone will work, study, exercise, rest, and live happily in the large park they have built.

    让绿荫护夏，红叶迎秋！
    林业部部长  梁希
    绿化这个名词太美丽了。山青了，水也会绿，水绿了，百水汇流的黄海也有可能渐渐地变成碧海。这样，青山绿水在祖国国土上织成一幅翡翠色的图案。这种美景，在旧中国不过是人们脑子里的一种理想，而新中国在不太久的将来就可以实现。
    伟大的农业发展纲要和社会主义总路线掀起了广大人民的绿化祖国高潮。不说四旁（宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁）植树，单说荒山荒地造林，今年上半年已造了三亿二千多万亩，等于旧中国从1911年到1946年这三十五年间造林总面积的七十倍。
    今天，我们要重新估计，十二年绿化将达到怎样程度？就是说，怎样才可以称绿化？关于这个问题，我们从前的计划是保守的。从前，我们对人口稀少的远山有顾虑，对土壤贫瘠的石山有顾虑，至于大面积沙漠，那更没有提到。
    绿化是全国的事，绿化是全民的事，人民有必要绿化全中国，人民也有能力绿化全中国，人民更有迫切的愿望绿化全中国。在这样的优越条件下，在这样的伟大人力下，我们必须重新估计绿化的可能性了。
    远山能不能绿化？能。湖南会同县和耒阳县造林远征队带了口粮和工具上山奋斗的勇气，贵州八十多万野战军在荒山上扎营苦战的干劲，河北平原和半山区群众一百五十多万人带同种子和苗木无代价地支援山区造林的共产主义协助精神，决不是路远所能阻挡的。只要人民决心征服荒山，那怕天涯地角都可以去。可以说，绿化“无远勿届”。
    石山能不能绿化？能。湖南祁东县归阳乡财宏社，今春出动了三百多人，向石山斗争两个月，开山凿穴，运搬客土来造林，终于使一千多亩紫色页岩穿上了绿衣。祁东全县就在财宏社的鼓动下，凿石造林二万多亩，群众说：“石硬没有决心硬，山高没有志气高”。
    沙漠能不能绿化？在社会主义的优越条件下，我们没有理由说不能。解放八年来，我国已改造了三千万亩沙荒。甘肃河西走廊本来计划在十年内营造的万里绿长城，今年一春就完成了造林面积的67％；在7月中旬，陕西榆林地区用飞机在五公里到二十公里距离的伊克昭盟沙漠边缘，成功地播种了沙蒿十九万亩。这些事实，都坚定了我们改造沙漠的信心。我们相信，在党的正确领导下，沙漠是可以变成绿洲的。
    上述几个问题以外，还有两个值得注意的问题：一个是大平原区，如河北和河南省的绿化问题。人们在京汉路上登高远眺，一望无际，目力可以直达到太行山麓，太空旷了。现在，粮食问题已经解决，可否各专区、各县定出一个森林复被率的标准，营造团状或带状的森林，将大平原处处隔断。这可以增加雨量，减少干旱，调节气候，对农田和卫生都有益的。另一个问题是黄河中游水土流失地区，可否在粮食只许增加不许减少的前提下，放弃陡坡来造林，把资金、劳力、机器放在较平坦的山田，努力增加单位面积产量，达到或超过农业发展纲要所指定的四百斤指标。
    以上都说造林。造林到此，林业大功告成了没有？没有。以后工作还很多，特别是抚育。第一、太疏的要使它密。除新造幼林枯死的要补植外，像南方某些省的马尾松林，当时已栽得很稀，往后又打枝过度，树冠与树冠不相接近，既不能保持水土，又不能供应通直的用材，这些林地要大大地补植。贵州省的抚育口号很正确，叫做“缺一株，补一株，缺一片，补一片”。第二、太密的要使它疏。许多封山育林区和幼林区，要定期疏伐，促进优势木的生长。第三、疏密适中的林地更有抚育的价值。福建南平溪后乡每公顷蓄积量一千多立方公尺的高产杉木林发现后，引起了全国注意，大家正在研究，如何更进一步，增加到每公顷三千、五千，甚至六千立方公尺以上。贵州锦屏县十八年成材的速生杉木林（称“十八杉”，下类推）发现后，引起了各方竞赛。黎平县提出了“十五杉”，剑河县提出了“八杉”，锦屏县万丰社更提出了“六杉”。高产、速生，关键都在于栽培和抚育。
    林业工作是做不完的。绿化，要做到栽培农艺化，抚育园艺化；绿化，要做到木材用不完，果实吃不尽，桑茶采不了；绿化，要做到工厂如花园，城市如公园，乡村如林园；绿化，要做到绿荫护夏，红叶迎秋。北京的山都成香山；安徽的山都成黄山；江西的山都成庐山；各地区都按照自己最爱好的名胜来改造自然。这样，中国九百五十万平方公里的国土全部成一大公园，大家都在自己建造的大公园里工作、学习、锻炼、休息，快乐地生活。
