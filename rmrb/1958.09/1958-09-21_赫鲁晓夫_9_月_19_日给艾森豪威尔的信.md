Khrushchev's Letter of September 19 to Eisenhower

To His Excellency President Eisenhower of the United States of America, Mr. President:

I have received and studied your letter of September 12. I am disappointed that I feel you have not understood the essence of my letter to you. The essence of this letter is to point out the full danger of what threatens mankind if the United States does not abandon its policy of aggression, which constantly creates hotbeds of serious conflict in one part of the world or another, and which is currently creating a particularly tense situation in the Far East.

The Dangerous Situation in the Taiwan Strait Region
The Only Reason is the U.S. Occupation of Chinese Territory

In your reply, you acknowledge the dangerous situation in the Taiwan area but attempt to absolve the U.S. government of responsibility for creating tensions threatening peace in this region. In order to justify America's aggressive actions, your letter completely distorts the facts, portraying the situation as fundamentally different from the truth.

Anyone who assesses the current situation calmly and based on facts cannot but acknowledge that the only real reason for the tension in this part of the world is that the United States has occupied the territory of Taiwan and many other islands, which have belonged to China since ancient times, and uses artillery to protect the Chiang Kai-shek group, who were driven out by the Chinese people, inciting them to harass and provoke People's China. Recent events are one manifestation of this overall U.S. policy of aggression against China.

Your opinion is strange, you say that I wrote to you but did not write to the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party you mentioned, and in your letter, you repeatedly used contemptuous and hostile tones towards them and the People's Republic of China. First of all, Mr. President, I want to tell you the following in this regard.

In the entire history of China, no political party, its leaders, or any government has enjoyed the trust and unlimited support of the entire Chinese people as much as the great Chinese Communist Party and its leaders, and the government of the People's Republic of China. Indeed, the leaders of the Communist Party are recognized leaders of the Chinese people, and now they lead not only the Chinese Communist Party but also the entire Chinese people, leading the new people's democratic country – the People's Republic of China.

U.S. Rude Interference in China's Internal Affairs
Has Seriously Threatened Peace in the Far East

The reason I am writing to the President of the United States, and not to the Government of the People's Republic of China, regarding the Taiwan issue is simple: it is not China that is interfering in U.S. internal affairs, but the United States that is trampling on all moral standards of civilized nations, rudely interfering in China's internal affairs, and attempting to impose its own system on other countries by force, thereby posing a serious threat to peace in the Far East. Furthermore, Mr. President, to ask us, as you do, to exert some influence on the Government of the People's Republic of China regarding the Taiwan issue means attempting to push the Soviet Union onto the path of interfering in China's internal affairs. The Soviet Union will never participate in such a shameful act, because this practice fundamentally violates the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and is incompatible with the unbreakable friendly and fraternal cooperation that unites the people of the Soviet Union and China.

As you deemed it necessary to point out in your letter, I recently visited Beijing and had the opportunity to exchange views with the leaders of the Government of the People's Republic of China on all issues of interest to the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. I can tell you directly and openly that our talks in Beijing once again proved that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have completely identical views on the most important issues: it is necessary to continue to resolutely oppose the forces of aggression and support the forces of peace around the world. The Chinese people eagerly hope to develop their economy and improve their living standards, which is only possible under conditions of peace and security. Therefore, it is quite natural that the Chinese people are very uneasy about the situation in the Taiwan area.

That general who was driven out by the Chinese people has continued to occupy Taiwan for many years, disobeying the legitimate government of China, and has seized several coastal islands only a few kilometers away from the major cities of China's coastal provinces. This intolerable situation exists entirely because the U.S. government interferes in China's internal affairs and uses force to protect the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Who can deny that if it were not for the support of the United States, neither the Chiang Kai-shek clique nor the so-called Taiwan issue would exist? If it were not for American interference, the people of this entire region would have long been living in peace and prosperity. Everyone knows that the starting point for the United States' illegal occupation of these islands is to maintain the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, enabling the United States to station its armed forces in this region and threaten the People's Republic of China with war. Only a traitor like Chiang Kai-shek, who betrays his own people, would allow a foreign country—the United States—to assemble armed forces against China, against the Chinese people.

Taiwan and the Coastal Islands Have Always Belonged to China
China Will Never Tolerate the Armed Occupation by Aggressors

You are trying hard to prove what cannot be proved, insisting that the U.S. government has some moral and legal right to station its armed forces in the Taiwan area. Everyone can interpret the facts according to their own moral standards, but one cannot depart from the facts. The facts themselves speak volumes. And the fact is: the U.S. government has forcibly occupied islands belonging to the Chinese people, located ten thousand kilometers away from the American continent, and is trying to entrench itself on these islands. Moreover, you hope that China will abandon this territory of its own, that China will tolerate its own territory being occupied by foreign countries and becoming a base for expanding aggression against the People's Republic of China and other peace-loving countries in Asia.

Isn't it clear, doesn't the entire experience of the people of all countries in their struggle for national liberation and independence show that a world power like the People's Republic of China will never agree to the partition of its territory, let alone tolerate the gathering on this territory of foreign armed forces aimed at aggression against it.

It can be seen from your letter that what the U.S. government is striving for is precisely to maintain this situation. Otherwise, what does it mean when you say that I did not write to the leaders of the People's Republic of China to "urge them to exercise restraint"? If we agree with your point of view, then in essence, we would be aiding and abetting war preparations against China—our great friend and ally. Even a fleeting thought of such a thing reveals the full absurdity of this idea. Mr. President, how can it be expected that we would paralyze the vigilance of our Chinese friends, aid and abet the preparation of aggressive forces to attack the People's Republic of China, and thereby aid and abet the preparation of an attack on the Soviet Union? It is futile to expect us to do this.

You say in your letter that Taiwan and the coastal islands have never been under the jurisdiction of Communist China. Such words are clearly intended to justify the attempt to occupy these territories of the People's Republic of China. In fact, the United States solemnly acknowledged that these territories belonged to China in the 1943 Cairo Declaration. This was reaffirmed in the 1945 Potsdam Declaration signed by the United States and some other major powers. Your predecessors, Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, respectively, signed these two declarations. Did the above-mentioned territories cease to belong to China simply because the Chinese people's revolution established a government that reflects the will of the entire Chinese people and is guided by communist ideology? Absolutely not. Denying this is tantamount to interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and assuming the functions of a gendarme.

Your statement proves that the U.S. government, regrettably, does not intend to abandon its interference in China's internal affairs and does not intend to abandon its policy of aggression against the People's Republic of China. This is precisely a very dangerous policy, which creates the danger of military conflicts breaking out in the Far East and other regions. If policies were formulated based on this concept, then, for example, if Britain had the strength, it could launch a war against the United States, using as a pretext the fact that the United States did not exist in the past and that its current territory was formerly a colony of the British Empire.

The Chiang Kai-shek Clique Has Long Become a Ghostly Apparition
The "Two Chinas" Conspiracy Is Bound to Fail

It must also be pointed out that your letter sets Taiwan and the coastal islands in opposition to the whole of China, which is an open attempt to create a "two Chinas" situation. This attempt to divide Chinese territory is resolutely opposed by the Chinese people and the Government of the People's Republic of China, and is also resolutely opposed by all who respect the sovereignty of all nations and the territorial integrity of all countries. Mr. President, it seems that you still believe that Chiang Kai-shek represents something in China. In fact, for the six hundred million Chinese people, he is nothing more than a hateful ghost. They hope to eliminate this ghost forever as quickly as possible. There is only one government in China—the Government of the People's Republic of China. Failure to see this means basing one's actions on illusions. Of course, illusions cannot serve as the basis for any country's foreign policy.

You insist in your letter that the actions of the U.S. armed forces in the Taiwan area are to fulfill the treaty obligations of the United States to a small group of Chinese traitors headed by Chiang Kai-shek. This excuse is also untenable. Needless to say, this small group no longer represents anyone except themselves. As early as 1949, the then U.S. Secretary of State Acheson believed that this small group had decayed and lost the trust of its own people. For example, Chiang Kai-shek now has no more reason to act as a representative of China than Kerensky had to act as a representative of the Soviet people. If we follow the logic in your letter, then if Kerensky were still alive and being kept somewhere in the United States, you could also sign a treaty with him as the head of the former provisional government of Russia, and then the United States could use this treaty, just as it is now using the treaty with Chiang Kai-shek, to launch a war against the Soviet Union. Doesn't this example show how absurd it is to use the treaty obligations that the United States has undertaken to Chiang Kai-shek as an excuse? Imagining and fabricating such treaties is merely to cover up aggressive purposes.

You mentioned in your letter that the Chiang Kai-shek, who is supported by the U.S. government, is recognized by most countries. Mr. President, I do not intend to learn such arithmetic, because it can easily lead to very wrong calculations. However, it should be pointed out that the People's Republic of China has now been recognized by more than thirty countries, and the population of these countries exceeds one billion.

Speaking of the fact that some governments recognize the Chiang Kai-shek clique, you yourself are well aware of the efforts that the United States has made in the past and is making now to maintain this recognition. Your Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, is also well aware of this. If I say that the countries that maintain relations with the Chiang Kai-shek elements are troubled by this recognition, and that this recognition is becoming obsolete, I am not revealing any secrets. There can be no doubt that most countries that maintain diplomatic relations with Chiang Kai-shek under pressure from the United States would be pleased if the situation that is clearly contrary to reason and runs counter to the interests of the people of these countries finally came to an end, and China occupied its rightful seat in international organizations.

Of course, you are well aware that even those countries that dare not recognize the People's Republic of China for fear of causing displeasure to the United States are also seriously concerned about the possible consequences of the United States' current policy towards the People's Republic of China. This is understandable, because the threats made by U.S. national leaders against the People's Republic of China, as well as the concentration of U.S. armed forces in the Taiwan area and some other U.S. war preparations, do indeed pose a threat of military conflict with all its dangerous consequences. As for blackmail and threats against People's China, it must be said that this approach has not achieved its purpose and cannot achieve its purpose.

If the U.S. Launches an Atomic Attack on China
The U.S. Will Inevitably Suffer a Retaliation in Kind

Just as I have already pointed out in my previous letter, some American military figures are even trying to threaten China with atomic weapons. According to newspaper reports, the United States is transferring air force units equipped with nuclear weapons to Taiwan, transporting various rockets and missiles, such as "Nike-Hercules" missiles, and building rocket and missile launch sites, etc. These actions by the U.S. government certainly cannot ease the tension in this region, cannot ease the situation, and cannot create conditions for strengthening trust. On the contrary, these actions have intensified the situation and increased the danger of a war breaking out using the most destructive modern weapons.

Mr. President, it should be told to you directly that atomic blackmail against the People's Republic of China cannot scare us, nor can it scare the People's Republic of China. Those who plan to launch an atomic attack on the People's Republic of China should not forget that it is not only the United States that possesses atomic and hydrogen weapons and the corresponding means of launching these weapons, and if such an attack is launched against the People's Republic of China, then the aggressor will immediately suffer a retaliation in kind.

Launching a war against China under the pretext of protecting the interests of so-called U.S. security or under any other equally contrived pretext will not gain anything for the United States. Launching a war against People's China means sending the sons of the American people to certain death, and it means igniting the flames of a world war. This means bearing a heavy responsibility to humanity and to history. Mr. President, you yourself must bear this responsibility.

Does it need to be particularly pointed out that this step by the U.S. government would be unanimously condemned by the people of the whole world, and I believe that this also includes the American people?

An Infringement on China is an Infringement on the Soviet Union
The United States Should Think Carefully Before Taking Action

I have already said to you, but I think it is necessary to emphasize once again that an infringement on the People's Republic of China is an infringement on the Soviet Union. We have concluded a treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance with our great friend, ally, and neighbor, People's China. This treaty is in line with the fundamental interests of the Soviet and Chinese people and in line with the interests of peace. No one needs to doubt that we will fully fulfill the obligations that we ourselves should undertake.

Therefore, I would like to once again ask you not to intensify the atmosphere, not to create a situation that makes peace-loving mankind uneasy, and to carefully consider and weigh all the circumstances before taking any steps that may cause disastrous consequences.

The responsibility of the governments of all countries, and first of all the responsibility of the governments of our two countries, is to make all necessary efforts to develop international affairs in the direction of strengthening peaceful cooperation, to develop trade, economic ties, and cultural relations between countries, and to use all the fruits of labor to improve the welfare of the people and ensure future progress.

After you were elected President of the United States, the national leaders of the Soviet Union had great hopes for you.

We remember that during the period when you served as the Supreme Commander of the armed forces of the United States, Britain, and France during the war against fascist, anti-Hitler Germany, the Soviet Union and the United States had good cooperation experience, and we once hoped that such cooperation could also be realized after the war, in the present period, in order to maintain and consolidate peace. However, the policy you have implemented as President has now largely undermined this good feeling, and increasingly makes us think that Mr. Dulles's "brink of war" policy is actually inseparable from your name and is linked to your name. This is very distressing.

In our era, the "position of strength" policy and the "brink of war" policy cannot succeed. Unlike the period when Hitler launched World War II, the forces of peace are now incomparably stronger. What is particularly important is that the balance of power on the international stage has undergone a fundamental change in favor of the forces of peace. History will severely condemn those government officials who disregard reason, disregard the interests of the people of all countries in the world, and attempt to embark on the road of military adventure.

China Has Repeatedly Proposed Peaceful Solutions to Disputes
But the United States Has Consistently Failed to Adopt a Realistic and Wise Attitude

It is known to all that the Government of the People's Republic of China has more than once demonstrated initiative and put forward proposals aimed at easing the tension in the Far East and peacefully resolving international disputes in this region.

Contrary to what you said in your letter, during the Sino-American ambassadorial talks in Geneva, the Chinese representatives repeatedly suggested that both sides, on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, should declare their willingness to resolve Sino-American disputes in the Taiwan area through peaceful negotiations without resorting to force or the threat of force. The reason why the Sino-American talks in Geneva did not achieve positive results is only because the United States refused to adopt such a position and later unilaterally broke off the talks.

You, Mr. President, said in your letter that you welcome the resumption of negotiations between the United States and the People's Republic of China. We also welcome the proactive attitude of the People's Republic of China, and we are pleased that the efforts of the Government of the People's Republic of China in this regard have received a response from the U.S. government.

We hope that in this negotiation, the United States will finally adopt a wise and realistic position. The wisdom and realism of the position can only be manifested in the fact that the U.S. government can evaluate the situation that has formed in light of the historical changes that have taken place in China, stop supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and draw the necessary conclusions from the fact that China is the People's Republic of China and that its government represents the Chinese state and the entire Chinese people.

If we do not implement a policy of war preparation, but truly follow the idea of peaceful cooperation, then the most important thing is to recognize the Government of the People's Republic of China. If the U.S. government can take this step, it can immediately normalize the international situation, which will be universally welcomed and considered a very valuable contribution to the cause of maintaining peace. If the United States adopts an attitude of peaceful cooperation towards solving international problems, then it must also stop pursuing disruptive policies in the United Nations and not hinder the solution to the urgent issue of restoring the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. This will undoubtedly be welcomed by all members of the United Nations, because without the participation of the People's Republic of China, the United Nations cannot become a dynamic international organization for maintaining world peace and security, as required by the United Nations Charter.

If American Soldiers Do Not Leave Taiwan on Their Own
They Will Definitely Be Driven Out by the Chinese People

Interference in China's internal affairs must be ended forever. The U.S. fleet must withdraw from the Taiwan Strait, and American soldiers must leave Taiwan and go home. Otherwise, there can be no lasting peace in the Far East.

If the United States does not do this now, then People's China has no choice but to expel the armed forces that are hostile to it from its own territory, from the territory where bases for attacking the People's Republic of China have been established. We fully stand on the side of the Chinese government and the Chinese people. We have always supported and will continue to support their policies.

If the U.S. government respects the sovereignty of the great Chinese people and bases its policy towards China on the principles of peaceful coexistence, then there is no doubt that this will not only eliminate the current tension in the Taiwan area, but will also create the necessary conditions for consolidating peace in the Far East and the world.

With respects,

N. Khrushchev

### 赫鲁晓夫9月19日给艾森豪威尔的信

1958-09-21
第2版()
专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫9月19日给艾森豪威尔的信美国总统艾森豪威尔先生阁下总统先生：
    我收到了您9月12日的信并且研究了它。我感到失望的是，我觉得，您没有明白我给您的信的实质。这封信的实质是要指明，如果美国不放弃它的侵略政策，时而在世界这一地区、时而在世界另一地区不断制造严重冲突的策源地，人类将会遭到怎样的威胁的全部危险；而在目前，它在远东制造了特别紧张的局势。
    台湾海峡地区形成了危险局势
    唯一原因是美国侵占中国领土
    您在回信中承认在台湾地区形成了危险局势，但是却企图为美国政府在这个地区制造威胁和平的紧张局势开脱责任。为了替美国的侵略行动辩解，在您的信中完全歪曲了事实真象，把情况描写得同事实根本不符。
    凡是根据事实、冷静地估计目前局势的人都不能不承认，在世界的这一部分地区形成紧张局势的唯一真正的原因是：美国侵占了自古以来就属于中国的领土——台湾和很多其他岛屿，并且在这些领土上用大炮保护被中国人民赶出来的蒋介石集团，鼓动他们对人民中国进行骚扰和挑衅。最近的事件就是美国对中国的这个总的侵略方针的表现之一。
    您的意见令人感到奇怪，您说，我写信给您，但是没有写信给您所说的中国共产党领袖，在您的信中对他们和对中华人民共和国不止一次地发出轻蔑的和敌意的语调。首先，总统先生，在这方面我要对您讲以下这些话。
    在中国的整个历史上，任何一个政党及其领导者，任何一个政府也没有享有像伟大中国共产党及其领导人，以及中华人民共和国政府所享有的全体中国人民那样的信任和无限的支持。的确，共产党的领导人是中国人民所公认的领袖，现在他们不仅领导着中国共产党，而且领导着全体中国人民，领导着新的人民民主国家——中华人民共和国。
    美国粗鲁地干涉中国的内政
    已给远东和平造成严重威胁
    我之所以要就台湾地区事件写信给美国总统，而不是写信给中华人民共和国政府，这个道理很简单，因为不是中国干涉美国内政，而是美国蹂躏了文明国家的一切道德标准，粗鲁地干涉了中国的内政，并且企图用武力在别国建立自己的制度，从而对远东和平造成严重的威胁。此外，总统先生，像您所做的一样，叫我们就台湾地区事件对中华人民共和国政府施加某种影响，这意味着企图把苏联推上干涉中国内政的道路。苏联永远也不会参与这种可耻的勾当，因为这种做法根本违背苏联的和平外交政策，同把苏中两国人民团结起来的、牢不可破的友好和兄弟合作关系毫不相容。
    正如您在信中认为需要指出的，不久前我访问过北京，并且有机会同中华人民共和国政府的领导人，就苏联和中华人民共和国感到兴趣的一切问题交换了意见。可以直截了当地、公开地告诉您，我们在北京的会谈再一次证明苏联和中华人民共和国在最主要的问题上看法是完全一致的：必须继续坚决地反对侵略势力和支持全世界维护和平的力量。中国人民热望发展自己的经济，提高自己的生活水平，这只有在和平和安全的条件下才有可能。因此，中国人民对台湾地区所形成的局势表示非常不安，这是十分自然的。
    被中国人民赶走的那个将军若干年来继续盘踞在台湾，不服从中国的合法政府，并且窃据离中国沿海各省大城市只有数公里远的若干沿海岛屿，这种不可容忍的情况之所以有可能存在，完全是因为美国政府干涉中国内政，用武力保护蒋介石卖国集团。
    谁能否认呢：要是没有美国的支持，不论蒋介石集团，或者所谓台湾问题都早就不存在了；如果没有美国的干涉，整个这一地区的人民早就过着安居乐业的生活了。人人都清楚，美国非法侵占这些岛屿的出发点是要维持台湾蒋介石集团，使美国有可能把自己的武装力量驻扎在这一地区并用战争来威胁中华人民共和国。只有像蒋介石这样的背叛自己人民的卖国贼才会允许外国——美国集结武装力量反对中国，反对中国人民。
    台湾和沿海岛屿从来就属于中国
    中国决不会容忍侵略者武装占领
    您极力企图证明那些无法证明的东西，硬说美国政府有着某种道义的和法律的权利要派自己的武装力量驻扎在台湾地区。每个人都可以按照他的道德标准来解释事实，但是，不能离开事实。事实本身说明问题。而事实是：美国政府用武力侵占了远离美洲大陆一万公里的属于中国人民的岛屿，并且力图盘踞这些岛屿。此外，您希望中国放弃自己的这块领土，希望中国容忍自己的这块领土被外国占领并成为对中华人民共和国和亚洲其他爱好和平的国家扩大侵略的基地。
    难道不是可以看得很清楚吗，难道各国人民争取民族解放和独立的斗争的全部经验不是在说明，像中华人民共和国这样的世界大国决不会同意割据它的领土，更不会容忍在这块领土上集结旨在侵略它的外国武装力量。
    从您的信中可以看出，美国政府所极力争取的正是保持这种局面。不然的话，您说我没有写信给中华人民共和国的领导人“敦促他们有所节制”，这句话是什么意思呢。如果我们同意您的观点，那么实质上就会助长对中国——我们伟大的朋友和盟国进行的战争准备。那怕是转一转这样的念头，这种想法的全部荒谬性就会暴露无遗了。总统先生，怎么能期待我们会去麻痹我们中国朋友的警惕性，会助长侵略势力准备对中华人民共和国进攻，从而助长准备对苏联的进攻呢。期待我们这样做是白费心机的。
    您在信中说，台湾和沿海岛屿从来没有在共产党中国的管辖下。这种话显然是想给侵占中华人民共和国这些领土的企图作辩解。其实美国在1943年的开罗宣言中就曾庄严地承认这些领土属于中国。在1945年由美国和一些其他大国签署的波茨坦宣言中又重申了这一点。您的前几任总统罗斯福和杜鲁门曾经分别在这两个宣言上签了字，难道由于中国人民革命胜利后成立了一个反映全体中国人民的意志和以共产主义思想为指南的政府，上述领土就不再属于中国了吗？决不是这样。否认这点就等于干涉其它国家人民的内政，就等于承担宪兵的职能。
    您的声明证明，美国政府，很遗憾，不打算放弃对中国内政的干涉，不打算放弃对中华人民共和国的侵略方针。这恰恰是一种非常危险的政策，它造成在远东和其他地区爆发军事冲突的危险。如果根据这种观念来制定政策，那末举个例说，英国如果有力量的话，就可以只拿美国过去并不存在、而它的现在的领土是以前不列颠帝国的殖民地这点作为理由，对美国发动战争了。
    蒋介石集团早已成为亡魂幽灵
    “两个中国”的阴谋肯定要破产
    还不能不指出，您的信中把台湾和沿海岛屿同全中国对立起来，这是公开企图制造“两个中国”的局势。这种分割中国领土的企图是中国人民和中华人民共和国政府所坚决反对的，也是一切尊重各国人民主权和各国领土完整的人所坚决反对的。总统先生，看来您直到现在还认为蒋介石代表着中国的什么。事实上对于六亿中国人民来说他只不过是令人仇恨的幽灵而已。他们希望尽可能快地永远消灭这个亡魂，中国只有一个政府——中华人民共和国政府。不看到这一点就意味着把自己的行动建立在幻想上面，当然，幻想是不能作为任何国家外交政策的基础的。　
    您在信中硬说，美国武装力量在台湾地区的行动是为了履行美国对以蒋介石为首的一小撮中国人民的叛徒的条约义务。这种借口也是站不住脚的。不用我说，这一小撮人除了他们自己以外，早就不代表任何人了，早在1949年，当时的美国国务卿艾奇逊就曾经认为这一小撮人已经腐朽了，已经丧失了本国人民的信任。举个例来说，蒋介石现在能作为中国代表，并不比克伦斯基当年作为苏联人民的代表更有理由。如果遵照您信中的逻辑，那末，要是克伦斯基还活着的话，还被豢养在美国什么地方的话，您也可以把他当作俄国曾经存在的临时政府的首脑而同他签订条约，然后美国可以根据这个条约，像它现在根据同蒋介石的条约一样，来对苏联发动战争了。这个例子难道不就表明，以美国对蒋介石承担的那种条约义务作为借口是多么荒唐吗。臆想出和编造出这样的条约只不过是为了掩盖侵略目的罢了。
    您在信中谈到，美国政府豢养的蒋介石得到大多数国家的承认。总统先生，我不打算学这样的算学，因为它可能使人算得大错特错。然而应该指出，中华人民共和国现在已经得到三十多个国家的承认，而这些国家的人口在十亿以上。
    说到有些政府承认蒋介石集团这件事，您自己清楚地知道，美国为了维持这种承认，过去和现在做出了怎样的努力。您的国务卿杜勒斯先生也清楚地知道这一点。如果我说，同蒋介石分子维持着关系的各国由于这种承认而苦恼，而且这种承认正在过时，这样说我并不是发现了秘密。可以毫不怀疑，在美国压力下同蒋介石保持着外交关系的大多数国家在下列情况下将会感到高兴，那就是最后终于结束了显然违背理智的、同这些国家人民的利益背道而驰的那种局面，中国在国际组织中占有它的合法席位。
    当然，您清楚知道，即使这些由于害怕引起美国的不满而不敢承认中华人民共和国的国家，对美国目前对待中华人民共和国的政策可能引起的后果也感到严重的不安。这是可以理解的，因为美国国家领导人对中华人民共和国的威胁，以及美国武装力量在台湾地区的集结和美国其他一些备战活动，的确造成了爆发具有一切危险后果的军事冲突的威胁。至于谈到对人民中国的讹诈和威胁，那末必须说，这种做法没有达到目的，也不可能达到目的。
    如果美国发动对中国的原子攻击
    美国必遭应有的同类武器的反击
    正像我在前一封信中所已经指出的那样，某些美国军界人物甚至企图用原子武器来威胁中国。据报纸报道说，美国正在向台湾调运配有核武器的空军部队，运送各种火箭和导弹，如“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹，建造火箭和导弹发射场等等。美国政府的这些行动当然不能缓和这个地区的紧张状态，不能缓和局势和造成加强信任的条件。相反，这些行动促使了局势的尖锐化，加剧了爆发一场使用毁灭性最大的现代化武器的战争的危险。
    总统先生，应该直截了当地告诉您，对中华人民共和国的原子讹诈既吓不倒我们，也吓不倒中华人民共和国。那些策划对中华人民共和国进行原子进攻计划的人不应当忘记，并不只是美国，而且另一方也拥有原子武器和氢武器以及相应的发射这些武器的工具，如果竟然对中华人民共和国发动这种进攻，那末，侵略者就将立即遭到应有的、同类武器的反击。
    在保护所谓美国安全的利益的借口下或者在任何其他的同样臆造的借口下对中国发动战争，不会使美国得到任何东西。对人民中国发动战争，就意味着让美国人民的子弟必然送死，就意味着燃起世界大战的火焰。这就意味着对人类、对历史负有严重的责任。总统先生，这种责任您自己也要担负。
    美国政府的这个步骤会受到全世界人民的一致谴责，我相信其中也包括美国人民，这一点难道还需要特别指出吗？
    对中国的侵犯就是对苏联的侵犯
    美国在采取行动前应该好好考虑
    我已经向您说过，但是我认为必须再一次强调指出，对中华人民共和国的侵犯就是对苏联的侵犯。我们同我国的伟大朋友、盟邦和邻国——人民中国缔结有友好同盟互助条约，这个条约符合苏联和中国人民的根本利益，符合和平的利益，任何人都无需怀疑：我们将完全履行我们自己所应承担的义务。
    因此，我愿意再一次要求您不要使气氛紧张化，不要制造使渴望和平的人类感到不安的局势，在采取任何可能造成灾难性后果的步骤以前，要好好考虑和衡量一下各种情况。
    各国政府的职责，首先是我们两国政府的职责是尽一切必要的努力，来使国际事态向着加强和平合作的方向发展，使各国间发展贸易、经济联系和文化关系，并且使劳动的全部成果都用于增进人民的福利和保证今后的进步。
    在您当选美国总统以后，苏联的国家领导人对您抱着很大的希望。
    我们记得，在反法西斯、反希特勒德国的战争期间您担任美国、英国和法国武装部队总司令这段时期内，苏联和美国曾经有过良好的合作经验，并且我们曾经希望在战后，在目前时期，也能实现这种合作，以利于维护和巩固和平。但是，您作为总统所执行的政策现在在很大程度上破坏了这种良好感情，并且越来越使我们认为：杜勒斯先生的“战争边缘”政策实际上是同您的名字分不开的，是同您的名字联系在一起的。这是很令人痛心的。
    在我们的时代，“实力地位”政策，“战争边缘”政策不可能得逞。同希特勒发动世界大战的时期不同，现在和平力量无比地壮大了，尤其重要的是，国际舞台上的力量对比发生了有利于和平力量的根本变化。历史将严厉地谴责那些不顾理智、不考虑世界各国人民的利益，企图走上军事冒险道路的政府人士。
  中国一再建议用和平方法解决争端
    美国却始终不采取现实明智的态度
    大家知道，中华人民共和国政府曾经不止一次地表现主动精神，提出了旨在缓和远东紧张局势及和平解决这一地区国际争端的建议。
    同您在信中所说的相反，在日内瓦中美大使级会谈过程中，中国代表曾一再建议，双方在相互尊重主权和领土完整、互不干涉内政的原则基础上宣布准备用和平谈判方法解决中美在台湾地区的争端，而不诉诸武力或用武力威胁。日内瓦中美会谈之所以没有得到积极结果，只是因为美国拒绝采取这种立场，并且在后来单方面地破坏了谈判。
    您总统先生，在自己的信中说，您欢迎恢复美国和中华人民共和国之间的谈判。我们也欢迎中华人民共和国的主动态度，并且对中华人民共和国政府在这方面的努力得到了美国政府的响应感到高兴。
    我们希望，在这次谈判中，美国终于会采取明智的、现实的立场。立场的明智性和现实性只能表现在：美国政府能够根据中国所发生的历史变化去评价所形成的局势，停止支持蒋介石集团，并且从中国就是中华人民共和国、它的政府代表中国国家和全体中国人民这一点作出必要的结论。
    如果不实行备战的方针，而真正遵循和平合作的思想，那末最主要的就是承认中华人民共和国政府。美国政府如果能够采取这种步骤，马上就可以使国际局势正常化，这将受到普遍的欢迎，认为它是对维护和平事业的极其有价值的贡献。如果美国对解决国际问题抱着和平合作的态度，那么还必须停止在联合国中执行捣乱政策，不阻挠解决刻不容缓的、恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的权利的问题。这无疑会受到联合国全体会员国的欢迎，因为没有中华人民共和国的参加，联合国就不能像联合国宪章所要求的那样，成为维护世界和平和安全的、有活力的国际组织。
    如果美国兵自己不离开台湾
    就一定要被中国人民赶出去
    必须永远结束对中国内政的干涉。美国舰队必须撤离台湾海峡，美国兵必须离开台湾回家去。否则，远东就不可能有持久和平。
    如果美国现在不这样做，那末人民中国别无办法，只有把敌视它的武装力量从它自己的领土上、从建立有进攻中华人民共和国的基地的领土上驱逐出去。我们完全站在中国政府、中国人民这一边。我们过去和将来一直都支持他们的政策。
    如果美国政府尊重伟大中国人民的主权，并把它对中国的政策建立在和平共处原则的基础上，那么毫无疑问，这不仅可以消除台湾地区目前的紧张局势，而且还会为巩固远东和世界和平创造必要的条件。
