    Rebutting Aiichiro Fujiyama's Repeated Slanders Against China

    After meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles on September 11th and 12th during his visit to the United States, Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama issued a joint statement. When discussing the situation in the Taiwan Strait, this joint statement slandered "the use of force by Communist China has created a serious tense situation in the Far East," and also slandered that "international communism remains the main threat to world peace." This once again shows that the policy of the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government, which follows the United States and is hostile to China, has not changed at all.

    Japan's economic crisis is becoming increasingly profound and prolonged. The Japanese people are dissatisfied with the Kishi Nobusuke government's servile attitude towards the United States in begging for scraps to satisfy the Japanese monopoly capital's ambition to expand economically into Southeast Asia. They demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government change its policy of following the United States and being hostile to China, coexist peacefully with China, and treat Asian and African countries with sincerity. They believe that this is the way for Japan to seek peaceful development and prosperity, and this voice is growing louder day by day. It was under this pressure from the Japanese people and Japanese public opinion that Fujiyama, before this visit to the United States, said in the Japanese Diet on August 30th that the Japanese "government does not recognize two Chinas" and that "the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair"; on September 1st, he also said in a House of Representatives committee that "due to historical and geographical reasons, there are feelings between Japan and China that may not be found in Sino-U.S. relations," and that he would try to get the United States to "better recognize these feelings." Now it seems that these words are nothing more than a smokescreen to deceive the Japanese people and public opinion, and a gesture made to bargain with the United States. Sure enough, in less than two weeks, Fujiyama sang the same tune as Dulles and repeated the old tune of slandering China! Everyone knows that the current serious situation in the Taiwan Strait is entirely due to the United States' crude interference in China's internal affairs and its intention to expand its aggressive actions to the Chinese inland sea islands of Jinmen and Mazu. U.S. military bases and troops in Japan and Okinawa have also been used to exacerbate this tense situation. The Chinese people's punishment of the Chiang Kai-shek clique members who frequently carry out harassment activities on the coastal islands, and the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory by taking appropriate measures at what they consider to be an appropriate time, is entirely a matter for the Chinese people themselves. If there is no American interference, there will be no issue of a "tense situation in the Far East." It is none other than the United States that is deliberately creating and maintaining a tense situation in the Far East. It is none other than the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government that is following the United States, providing military bases for the United States, and attempting to absolve the United States of its crimes of aggression. Fujiyama's singing the same tune as Dulles proves once again that this newspaper's past exposure and analysis of the underlying imperialist nature of the Kishi Nobusuke government is completely correct and necessary.

    Fujiyama's attitude towards the situation in the Taiwan Strait in the joint statement with Dulles is in sharp contrast to the "Basic Policy for Breaking the Deadlock in Sino-Japanese Relations" recently announced by the Japanese Socialist Party, as well as the statements and resolutions issued by the Japanese Communist Party and various Japanese peace and democratic groups on the Taiwan issue. This vividly reflects the struggle between two paths currently existing in Japan. One path is to follow the United States, act according to the wishes of the United States, conspire with the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee groups to form a Northeast Asian anti-communist alliance, allow the United States to retain its military bases in Japan for a long time, intensify its involvement in the U.S. nuclear strategy system, and attempt to use U.S. power to make a comeback and relive the imperialist dream. This is the path taken by the Kishi Nobusuke government. The other path is to break away from U.S. control, demand that the United States abolish its military bases in Japan, withdraw its troops stationed in Japan, and recover Okinawa; demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government abandon its policy of hostility towards China, abandon its conspiracy to create two Chinas, no longer obstruct the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, coexist peacefully with China, oppose U.S. interference in China's internal affairs, and oppose the United States' use of Japanese military bases to aggravate the tense situation in the Far East. This is the path that the broad masses of the Japanese people want to take. For the Japanese people, the former means war and disaster, and the latter means peace and prosperity. Fujiyama's expression of "a higher degree of cooperation" with the United States during this visit to the United States, further binding Japan to the U.S. war chariot, and his blatant support for U.S. aggression on the Taiwan issue, once again revealing his naked anti-China face, is not only intolerable to the Chinese people, but will also arouse greater opposition from the Japanese people. The Kishi Nobusuke government is intensifying the creation of a tense situation in the Far East by following the United States, and will not have any good results other than reaping what it sows!

### 斥藤山爱一郎又一次诬蔑中国的言行

    斥藤山爱一郎又一次诬蔑中国的言行
    日本外务相藤山爱一郎访问美国，在9月11、12两日同美国国务卿杜勒斯会谈之后，发表了一项联合声明。这项联合声明谈到台湾海峡局势的时候，诬蔑说“共产党中国使用武力一事在远东制造了严重的紧张局势”，同时还诬蔑说“国际共产主义仍然是世界和平的主要威胁”。这就再一次表明，日本岸信介政府追随美国、敌视中国的政策，至今毫无改变。
    日本的经济危机正在日益深刻化和长期化。日本人民不满意岸信介政府向美国奴颜婢膝地讨取一点残羹剩饭，以满足日本垄断资本向东南亚进行经济扩张野心的作法，而要求岸信介政府改变追随美国、敌视中国的政策，同中国和平共处，同亚非各国以诚相见，并认为这才是日本求得和平发展和繁荣的道路，这种呼声一天比一天增长。正是在日本人民和日本舆论的这种压力之下，藤山在这次访美之前，8月30日才在日本国会说日本“政府不承认两个中国”，“台湾问题是中国内政问题”；9月1日，又在众议院一个委员会上说“由于历史和地理上的原因，日中两国之间存在着中美关系中未必找得到的感情”，他将力图使美国“更好地承认这些感情”。现在看来，这些话不过是欺骗日本人民和舆论的一种烟幕以及向美国讨价还价而作出的姿态而已。果然，不出两个星期，藤山就跟杜勒斯一个鼻孔出气，重弹诬蔑中国的老调了！谁都知道，目前台湾海峡的严重局势完全是由于美国粗暴地干涉中国内政，并且要把它的侵略行动扩大到中国内海岛屿金门马祖而造成的。美国在日本和冲绳的军事基地和驻军，也已经被利用来加剧这种紧张局势。中国人民惩罚在沿海岛屿经常进行骚扰活动的蒋介石集团分子，和中国人民在自己认为是适当的时间采取适当的措施解放自己的国土，完全是中国人民自己的事情。如果没有美国干涉，根本就不发生什么“远东紧张局势”的问题。在远东蓄意制造和保持紧张局势的，不是别人，恰恰是美国。追随美国，为美国提供军事基地并且企图为美国洗脱侵略罪名的，又恰恰是日本岸信介政府。藤山跟着杜勒斯唱起同一调子，这就又一次证明：本报过去对岸信介政府潜在的帝国主义的本质的揭露和分析，是完全正确的，必要的。
    藤山在和杜勒斯的联合声明中，对于台湾海峡局势所表示的态度，同日本社会党最近公布的“打开中日关系僵局的基本方针”以及日本共产党、日本各和平民主团体等就台湾问题所发表的声明、决议，是一个极为尖锐的对照。这鲜明地反映了日本目前存在的两条道路的斗争。一条道路是：追随美国，按照美国意旨，同蒋介石、李承晚集团阴谋结成东北亚反共联盟，允许美国长期保留它在日本的军事基地，加紧卷入美国原子战略体系，企图借美国力量东山再起，重温帝国主义好梦。这就是岸信介政府所走的道路。另一条道路是摆脱美国控制，要求美国撤销它在日本的军事基地，撤退它驻在日本的军队，收回冲绳；要求岸信介政府放弃敌视中国政策，放弃制造两个中国的阴谋，不再阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复，同中国和平共处，反对美国干涉中国内政，反对美国利用日本军事基地加剧远东紧张局势。这是日本广大人民所要走的道路。对于日本人民来说，前者意味着战争和灾祸，后者意味着和平和繁荣。藤山这次访问美国时表示要同美国进行“更高程度的合作”，进一步把日本绑上了美国战车，在台湾问题上又公然为美国侵略张目，又一次露出了它赤裸裸的敌视中国面目，这不仅是中国人民不能容忍，也必将激起日本人民的更大反对。岸信介政府跟着美国加紧制造远东紧张局势，除了自食其果以外，决不会有什么好的结果！
