Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 10th: Reporter Chen Qitong and Lin Junqing report: Tens of thousands of militiamen on the front lines of Xiamen Island and on the Greater and Lesser Deng Islands in Fujian have been fully mobilized, ready to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to completely annihilate any enemy who dares to invade.

These past few days, armed militiamen have been standing guard at forward positions, intersections, and docks. Day and night, they stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the People's Liberation Army, defending the motherland's coastline and maintaining the transportation lines in the front-line areas. In some villages that are frequently shelled by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, young and middle-aged militiamen have formed many stretcher teams and transport teams. Maritime support and transportation teams, formed by fishermen and boatmen, are bravely carrying out busy water transport work to support the front.

The militiamen on the front lines of Xiamen Island and on the Greater and Lesser Deng Islands have a glorious combat tradition. The Greater and Lesser Deng Islands, only five or six *li* from Jinmen Island, have been subjected to shelling by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops almost every day for more than eight years since liberation. But the heroic people are invincible. They have built a dense network of trenches and various anti-artillery and anti-air raid facilities on the islands, often persisting in production under enemy fire and bravely carrying out the struggle to defend the coast. Recently, after U.S. imperialism openly declared its intention to interfere in our country's internal affairs and engage in military provocations, the militiamen on these outpost islands were filled with righteous indignation and immediately mobilized. Militiamen from Hecu and Wutong townships on the front lines of Xiamen Island held denunciation rallies and mobilization rallies one after another, launching various preparations to support the front lines and combat. Zhang Qingshi, a seventeen-year-old youth from Greater Deng Island, resolutely demanded to join the militia team and the support-the-front team, to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinmen and Mazu, and to avenge his father, who was killed by American-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft. The militiamen of Linbian Village in Xiamen's Wutong Township, where all nineteen houses in the village were destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's artillery fire, actively led the villagers in helping the People's Liberation Army build coastal defense works. The militia of Qianpu Village, which faces Jinmen Island across the sea, established various organizations to support the front lines and also established a special vegetable production and supply organization. Their slogan for supporting the front lines is: "We have the people, we have the boats, wherever you want to go, we'll go!"

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th: "Grasp weapons tightly, strengthen military training, be ready to listen to the call of the motherland at any time, and be ready to resist the invading American aggressors at any time!" This is the angry roar of more than 1.6 million militiamen in Shanxi Province.

The militiamen from the old revolutionary base areas such as the Taihang Mountains, Taiyue Mountains, Lüliang Mountains, and Wutai Mountains, which have a glorious revolutionary tradition, have held large-scale demonstrations and parades for days, expressing their firm support for Premier Zhou's statement and opposing U.S. imperialist military provocations in the Taiwan Strait. More than 300,000 militiamen in the Taihang and Taiyue mountain areas are determined to strengthen their strength to defend the motherland by stepping up military training, maintaining local public security, and doing a good job in autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. More than 12,000 militiamen in Qin Yuan County, who were famous throughout the country for bravely fighting Japanese aggressors during the War of Resistance Against Japan, shouted slogans such as "We will never allow American bandits to run rampant on our territory!" and "We must liberate Taiwan!" on the evening of the 7th, parading with torches and carrying weapons in villages, towns, and construction sites until late at night. The angry roars shook the valleys. Bao Bing'an, a militia hero who killed the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan, announced at a demonstration held in Chengguan on behalf of the county's militiamen: they will carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, bring out the courage and determination to fight the Japanese devils, and achieve "carrying guns on the land, practicing martial arts during rest, everyone learns live ammunition shooting, and is ready to listen to the call of the motherland at any time." More than 30,000 militiamen from Yuci, Taigu, and Yangquan also conducted combat exercises such as gun shooting, reviewing their combat strength. Su Yihe, a demobilized soldier in the militia, said: "In order to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan, and to strike at American bandits, I will definitely teach the combat skills I have learned to the militiamen as soon as possible. If the motherland needs it, I will go to the front line for the third time!"

After a long period of "combining labor and military affairs," the militiamen in Shanxi Province have undergone necessary military training, and now 76% of the militiamen have achieved "good" results in live ammunition shooting. Based on these militiamen as the backbone, the province has also established a labor army of 4.29 million people, combining workers, farmers, and soldiers, which is both industrial and agricultural and also military. The establishment of this labor army not only meets the needs of national defense construction and promotes the glorious tradition of the militia's "combination of labor and military affairs," but also plays a huge role in the leap-forward development of industrial and agricultural production and construction.

    支援前线　保卫海防
    福建前线沿海民兵总动员
    山西老根据地民兵大示威
    新华社福建前线10日电　记者陈启桐、林俊卿报道：福建前线厦门岛前沿和大小登岛上的成千上万的民兵已经总动员，准备随时配合人民解放军彻底歼灭胆敢进犯的敌人。
    这几天，在前哨阵地、路口和码头上，到处都有荷枪实弹的民兵在站岗放哨。他们日夜和人民解放军并肩保卫着祖国的海防，维护着前线地区的交通运输线。在经常受到蒋贼军炮击的一些村庄里，青壮年民兵们已经组成了许多担架队、运输队。渔民和船民们组成的海上支前运输队，正在勇敢地进行着繁忙的水上支前运输工作。
    厦门岛前沿和大小登岛上的民兵们有着光荣的战斗传统。距金门岛只有五、六里的大小登岛。从解放后的八年多来，几乎没有一天不遭受金门蒋贼军的炮击。但是英勇的人民是不可战胜的，他们在岛上建立了密如蛛网的交通壕和各种防炮、防空设施，经常在敌人的炮火下坚持生产，英勇地进行着保卫海防的斗争。最近，当美帝国主义公开宣称要干涉我国内政，进行军事挑衅以后，处在这些前哨岛屿上的民兵们莫不义愤填膺，立即动员起来。厦门岛前沿何厝、五通等乡的民兵纷纷举行控诉大会和誓师大会，展开各种支援前线和战斗的准备工作。大登岛十七岁的青年张青狮坚决要求参加民兵队和支前队，支援解放军解放金门、马祖，为他被美制蒋机打死的父亲报仇。全村十九座房子全被蒋军炮火打坏了的厦门五通乡林边村的民兵们，积极带领全村人民帮助解放军构筑海防工事。和金门岛隔海相望的前埔村民兵建立了各种支援前线的组织，还专门成立了蔬菜生产供应组织。他们支援前线的口号是：“要人有人，要船有船，要到哪里，就到哪里！”
    新华社太原10日电　“紧握武器，加强军事训练，随时听候祖国的召唤，随时准备抗击胆敢进犯的美国侵略者！”这是山西省一百六十多万民兵的怒吼声。
    有着光荣革命传统的太行山、太岳山、吕梁山和五台山等革命老根据地的民兵，连日来分别举行了声势浩大的示威游行，表示坚决拥护周总理的声明，反对美帝国主义在台湾海峡的军事挑衅。太行、太岳山区的三十多万民兵，决心要以加紧练武、搞好地方治安、作好秋收秋耕秋种工作的实际行动，来增强保卫祖国的力量。曾在抗日战争中英勇打击日本侵略者而闻名全国的沁源县的一万二千多民兵，7日晚上曾高呼着“决不容许美国强盗在我国领土上横行霸道！”“我们一定要解放台湾！“等口号，在村镇和工地上拿着火炬、扛着武器，一直游行到深夜。愤怒的吼声震撼着山谷。抗日战争中的民兵杀敌英雄宝丙安，代表全县民兵在城关举行的示威大会上宣布：他们要发扬光荣的革命传统，拿出打日本鬼子的勇气和决心来，作到“上地带枪、休息练武，人人学会实弹射击，随时听候祖国召唤。”榆次、太谷两县和阳泉市的三万多民兵，还进行了举枪射击等战斗演习，检阅了自己的战斗力量。民兵中的复员军人苏义和说：“为了解放金门、马祖和台湾，打击美国强盗，我一定把自己学会的战斗本领，尽快地教给民兵们。如果祖国需要，我就第三次走上前线！”
    山西省的民兵经过长期的“劳武结合”，进行了必要的军事训练，现在已有占76％的民兵实弹射击成绩达到“良好”。全省以这些民兵为骨干，还建立了一支由四百二十九万人组成的亦工亦农亦兵的工农兵相结合的劳动大军，这支劳动大军的建立不仅适应国防建设的需要，发扬了民兵“劳武结合”的光荣传统，而且在飞跃发展的工农业生产建设中，也起到了巨大的作用。
