How to Smelt Gray Cast Iron in Indigenous Blast Furnaces
    Jin Fuxiang, Engineer, Metallurgical Bureau of the State Economic Commission
    In the newspapers, we often see references to gray cast iron and white cast iron. Gray cast iron is pig iron used for sand casting, while white cast iron is pig iron used for steelmaking. The difference between them is that sand casting pig iron has a higher silicon content, while steelmaking pig iron has a lower silicon content. When the silicon content is low, carbon and iron combine to form white cast iron; when the silicon content is high, carbon and iron separate, forming gray cast iron. Gray cast iron has low hardness and high toughness, allowing it to be machined. White cast iron is brittle and hard, and cannot be machined.
    In a blast furnace, smelting gray cast iron mainly relies on increasing the hearth temperature to increase silicon reduction. To increase the hearth temperature, it is necessary to increase the heat inside the blast furnace. The heat source of a blast furnace comes from two sources: one is the heat generated by the combustion of coke, and the other is blowing air at a relatively high temperature (generally called hot air) into the furnace. The hot air blown into the furnace is generally between 500 and 900 degrees Celsius, with the highest being over 1,000 degrees Celsius. To increase the hearth temperature, if the temperature of the hot air blown into the furnace from the outside remains constant, more coke must be added to increase heat generation. According to local experiences, smelting gray cast iron in a blast furnace consumes 15%–20% more coke than smelting white cast iron.
    The smelting principle of indigenous ironmaking is the same as that of blast furnaces; the differences lie in the furnace shape and the temperature of the air blown into the furnace. Indigenous furnaces generally use cold air, while blast furnaces use hot air.
    Across the country, there are many successful experiences in smelting gray cast iron using cold air. As long as attention is paid to the following issues, it is not difficult to smelt gray cast iron in indigenous furnaces.
    To ensure sufficient heat generation inside the furnace, the consumption ratio of ore to fuel must be formulated based on the ore conditions. In areas using anthracite or coke for ironmaking, the quality of the coke or anthracite (mainly the ash and sulfur content) must be considered to determine the ratio. Generally, the ratio of ore to fuel should be at least one jin of ore (with an average iron content of 50%) to 2.5 to 3 jin of fuel. Depending on the iron content of the ore, coke consumption can be increased or decreased appropriately.
    After the iron ore is loaded from the top of the furnace, it passes through the entire furnace and descends to the bottom before being reduced to pig iron. If the ore particles are large, although the ore reaches the bottom of the furnace, the iron in the ore has not yet been separated. If the particle size of the ore is reduced, the contact area between the ore and the rising airflow can be increased, which is conducive to ore reduction. Due to the different properties of the ore, it cannot be uniformly specified. Easily reducible ore can have a slightly larger particle size, while difficult-to-reduce ore should have a smaller particle size. The best particle size is around 5 to 25 millimeters. The ore can also be divided into two grades and added to the furnace separately, for example, dividing it into a 5-10 mm grade and a grade larger than 10 mm. This helps stabilize the temperature inside the furnace.
    The shape of the furnace has a great influence on smelting. The height of the furnace should be adjusted appropriately based on the reduction of the ore. If using easily reducible ore, the height of the furnace can be reduced; if the ore is difficult to reduce, in addition to reducing the particle size, the indigenous furnace should also be appropriately heightened. This can also promote an increase in the furnace temperature.
    Powdered ore after ore crushing and powdered coke or anthracite sieved out can be made into sintered ore and added to the furnace. This not only fully utilizes the powdered ore and coke powder, but also enhances ore reduction in the furnace. Furthermore, when making sintered ore, some limestone can be added to the raw materials. This reduces the amount of limestone directly added to the furnace, increasing the amount of coke and ore charged, thereby increasing the hearth temperature.
    Small blast furnaces should also adopt a method of progressing from indigenous to modern, gradually implementing technological revolution. First, start with the power system and improve the current method of using manual wooden bellows for blowing air, replacing wooden bellows with blowers. Because to ensure that the furnace temperature increases, there must be sufficient air volume and air pressure. The power for the blower can be provided by an electric motor in areas with electricity, and boiler-tractor units, gas engines, diesel engines, etc., can be used in areas without electricity.
    Second, use a hot-blast stove to change the method of cold-air operation. This is a thorough technological revolution and also the future direction of development for indigenous furnaces. The gas discharged from the top of the indigenous furnace has a large amount of heat and can be used as fuel for burning the hot-blast stove, without having to use anthracite separately to burn the hot-blast stove. As long as the top part of the indigenous furnace is modified, the gas discharged from the top of the furnace can be used after passing through a simple dust collector made of bricks. Using hot air for blowing not only makes it easier to smelt gray cast iron, but also reduces fuel consumption by 15% to 20%. (Originally published in "Learn Science")

　　土高炉怎样炼出灰口铁
    国家经济委员会冶金局工程师　金福祥
    在报上经常看到灰口铁和白口铁的说法。灰口铁是翻砂用的生铁，白口铁是炼钢用的生铁。它们的差别是：翻砂生铁含硅量较高，炼钢生铁含硅量较低。含硅量较低时，炭和铁化合在一起形成白口铁；含硅量较高时炭铁分离开，便成灰口铁。灰口铁硬度低、韧性强，可以进行机械加工。白口铁又脆又硬，不能进行机械加工。
    在高炉中冶炼灰口铁，主要是靠提高炉缸温度来增加硅的还原。要想提高炉缸温度，必须增加高炉内部的热量。高炉热量的来源，一是靠焦炭燃烧发热，一是把较高温度的空气（一般称为热风）吹进炉子里。吹进炉子里的热风，一般在摄氏五百到九百度，最高的在一千度以上。要想提高炉缸温度，如果由外部吹进炉子里的热风温度不变，就必须多加焦炭，以增加发热量。根据各地的经验，在高炉炼灰口铁比炼白口铁要多消耗15％—20％的焦炭。
    土法炼铁的冶炼原理，和高炉一样，所不同的是炉形不同和吹进炉子里的风温不同。土炉一般用冷风，高炉用热风。
    全国各地用冷风冶炼灰口铁的成功经验很多。只要注意下边一些问题，土炉子炼出灰口铁并不是一件难事。
    要保证在炉内有足够的发热量，必须根据矿石的情况制订出矿石同燃料的消耗比例。采用无烟煤或焦炭炼铁的地区，当然要看焦炭或无烟煤的质量如何（主要是灰份和含硫量的多少）来确定，一般矿石与燃料的比例至少要保持一斤矿石（矿石含铁量平均为50％）用二点五斤到三斤燃料。根据矿石含铁量的高低，还可以适当增加或减少焦炭的消耗量。
    铁矿石从炉子顶部装进去以后，经过整个炉子一直降低到炉子下部，才把铁矿石还原成生铁。如果矿石块度较大，虽然矿石降到炉底，但矿石里的铁还没分离出来。如果把矿石的粒度改小，就能增加矿石和上升气流的接触面积，有利于矿石的还原。由于矿石的性质不同，不能一律规定。容易还原的矿石块度可稍大一些，不容易还原的矿石粒度小些。最好的粒度是在五公厘到二十五公厘左右。还可以把矿石分成二级分别加入炉内，例如分成五——十公厘一级和大于十公厘的一级，这对稳定炉内部的温度是有帮助的。
    炉子的形状对冶炼有很大关系。应该根据矿石还原的情况，适当调整炉子的高度。使用容易还原的矿石，可以把炉子的高度降低一些；如果矿石很难还原，除了把粒度改小外，还应当适当的把土炉加高，这也能促进炉内温度提高。
    矿石破碎后的粉矿和焦炭或无烟煤筛下的粉末，可以做成烧结矿加入炉内。这样不但能把粉矿焦粉充分利用，而且可以增强矿石在炉内的还原，并且可以在做烧结矿时，在原料里加添一些石灰石，这样便可以减少直接加入炉内的石灰石，增加焦炭、矿石的装入量，达到提高炉缸温度的目的。
    小高炉也应该采用由土到洋的办法，逐步实行技术革命。首先从动力系统着手，改进现在用人力木风箱鼓风的办法，用鼓风机代替木风箱。因为要保证炉内温度提高，必须有足够的鼓风量与风压。鼓风机的动力，在有电力的地区可以用电动机带动，在没有电力的地方可使用锅驼机、煤气机、柴油机等等。
    其次是用热风炉，改变冷风操作的办法。这是一个彻底的技术革命，也是今后土炉的发展方向。从土炉炉顶排出的气体有很大的发热量，可以做燃烧热风炉的燃料，不必再另外用无烟煤烧热风炉。只要把土炉的炉顶部分改造一下，把从炉顶排出的煤气，经过用砖砌成的简单的除尘器之后，便可以使用。用热风鼓风，不但容易冶炼出灰口铁，而且可以降低燃料消耗15％到20％。　（原载“学科学”）
