    Resolution on Launching a Science and Technology Gift Campaign for the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China and Preparing to Convene a National Congress of Active Elements in Scientific and Technological Invention and Creation
    In order to further mobilize the nation’s science and technology workers and the broad masses, to summon up our energy, and to launch an even broader and deeper mass movement of technological revolution across the country, the congress resolves:
    I. Launch a science and technology gift campaign for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The congress calls on science and technology workers across the country to closely focus on the central tasks of current industrial and agricultural production, especially the "three marshals" and "two pioneers," and the requirements of national defense construction, to make contributions in scientific and technological invention and creation, in order to promote the great leap forward in production and the great leap forward in science and technology. In particular, this year, we should strive to achieve the Party Central Committee's call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel. Specific measures for the gift campaign will be determined separately.
    II. In order to centrally reflect the masses' scientific and technological achievements in the socialist great leap forward, to exchange experiences in invention and creation, and to commend advanced figures in the technological revolution movement, the congress has decided to convene a National Congress of Active Elements in Scientific and Technological Invention and Creation in Beijing in September 1959. It requires science and technology associations at all levels, under the leadership of the Party and the government, to cooperate with relevant parties to fully mobilize the masses to actively carry out preparatory work. Specific measures for convening the meeting will be determined separately.
