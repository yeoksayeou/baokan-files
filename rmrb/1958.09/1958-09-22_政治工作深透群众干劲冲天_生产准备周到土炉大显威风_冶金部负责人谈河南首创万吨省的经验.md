Xinhua News Agency, 21st: After the people of Henan Province launched a "satellite" of high pig iron production on September 15th, many provinces and regions have proposed to learn from and catch up with Henan. Taking Henan as an example, they have formulated high pig iron production plans, determined to make a great leap forward in pig iron production in the near future.

For this reason, the reporter specifically asked the responsible person of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to talk about the great significance and main experience of Henan Province in creating a high pig iron production record.

The responsible person said that pig iron production in Henan Province began to rise in September. On the 15th, a new situation of a leap forward appeared. On this day, more than 50,000 indigenous blast furnaces were started throughout the province; more than 3.6 million iron and steel troops were mobilized in a mighty force; 18,694 tons of iron were produced (sintered iron not included). This figure exceeds the daily output of pig iron in the entire Northeast region; eight counties in the province had a daily output of more than 1,000 tons of iron. This achievement is tremendous.

Although Henan Province produced indigenous iron in the past, its foundation was not good. How did they leap forward? The responsible person analyzed seven reasons:

First, putting politics in command and conducting ideological education deeply and thoroughly have widely mobilized the masses.

Party committees at all levels in Henan Province spent a month carrying out a major debate on iron and steel production among the masses at the furnace front, mining areas, and other iron and steel production sites. The content of the debate was: (1) Can the iron and steel production task be completed? Is the raw material guaranteed? What measures should be taken to ensure completion? (2) What are the difficulties? How to overcome them? (3) What will you contribute to the iron and steel industry?

Through extensive and in-depth debates, three viewpoints on iron and steel industrial production were emphatically criticized (the theory of mystery in the iron and steel industry, the theory of doubt about indigenous blast furnaces, and the theory of conditions); two factions (the recession faction and the hand-stretching faction) and two -isms (decentralization and localism) were criticized. Therefore, the broad masses of people are very determined to run the iron and steel industry on a large scale and have sufficient enthusiasm. Many moving deeds have emerged. Among the 3.6 million iron and steel production troops in the province, there are not only young adults but also a large number of women, old ladies, and teenagers; some people have postponed their weddings, determined to wait until the iron and steel plan is completed before getting married; many people traveled from dozens or even hundreds of kilometers away to the production site. The iron and steel troops in Bo'ai County transported coal from Jiaozuo, sleepless all night. The team was six or seven miles long, and the morale of the masses was still very high in the autumn rain.

Second, from the provincial, regional, and county party committees to the township party committees, the first secretaries took command, went to the front line, and directed iron and steel production day and night.

They ate and slept in the open air, and ate, lived, and labored with thousands of ironworkers in front of the furnace. For example, Yu County, which created the national record for the highest pig iron production in various counties on the 15th, had five county party secretaries and seventeen county party committee members commanding ironmaking at four key points, respectively. The secretaries of party committees at all levels in Lushan County created eighty-three "secretary experience furnaces" themselves to participate in and guide ironmaking. In order to strengthen command, some regional committees moved to key ironmaking counties to work, and some county committees moved to steel plants to work.

Third, focus on indigenous blast furnaces to engage in large-scale ironmaking.

Indigenous blast furnaces are quick to build and do not require any mechanical equipment. Therefore, Henan Province built 70,000 indigenous blast furnaces in a short period of time, which quickly led to a leap forward in pig iron production. At present, the province is still building 30,000 indigenous blast furnaces, and plans to build another 20,000 indigenous blast furnaces. When all 120,000 indigenous blast furnaces are completed, even if half of them maintain normal production, they can produce 30,000 tons of iron per day. The high pig iron production record in Henan Province fully proves that vigorously building indigenous blast furnaces and striving for most of them to operate normally is a shortcut to making pig iron production leap forward at present.

Fourth, production preparation work, mainly transportation and raw material supply, has been done well.

The province mobilized 420,000 vehicles of various types to participate in the transportation work of iron and steel production, on an unprecedented scale. Prior to this, the province had built three main highways leading to mountainous areas and mining areas, built 9,500 kilometers of simple highways and more than 70,000 kilometers of avenues and pack animal roads, paving the way for the iron and steel marshals. Many regions have established transportation command headquarters, large vehicle divisions, horse-drawn carriage divisions, etc., to strengthen the organization and scheduling of transportation work. In terms of raw material supply, various places have sufficient reserves of iron ore and coal. On the afternoon and evening of the 13th, Yu County mobilized cadres to make 150,000 catties of coal balls needed for ironmaking; in order to strive for high ironmaking production, Baofeng County established more than 3,000 coal kilns, brick and tile kilns, lime kilns, and machinery factories to prepare for furnace construction and ironmaking.

Fifth, various places have created many good experiences and good working methods, which directly promoted this high-yield record.

The "seven definitions" (defining leadership, defining tasks, defining time, defining equipment, defining quality, defining labor, and defining safety) of ironmaking furnaces created by Yu County, and the "three changes" proposed by Lushan County (factories become classrooms, miracles of iron and steel production become teaching materials, rest becomes labor), are all good working methods and can be promoted.

Sixth, the great leap forward in agricultural production and the realization of communization in the province have freed up a large number of rural laborers, which has created favorable conditions for the whole people to engage in iron and steel on a large scale.

Seventh, mountainous areas and plains support and cooperate with each other.

Finally, the person in charge said that Henan Province is a red flag in the national pig iron production, and its pig iron production is far ahead of the provinces and cities. The high production record created this time provides many useful experiences for iron and steel production across the country. In particular, those who are still skeptical about indigenous blast furnaces will get a good experience here. Now, Henan Province is advancing victoriously, preparing to launch bigger "satellites" and achieve greater yields on the iron and steel production front. We expect that other regions will catch up and launch high-yield "satellites" of iron and steel.

    政治工作深透群众干劲冲天
    生产准备周到土炉大显威风
    冶金部负责人谈河南首创万吨省的经验
    据新华社21日讯　河南省人民在9月15日发射了生铁高产的“卫星”以后，许多省、区纷纷提出学河南，赶河南，并以河南为榜样，制订了生铁高产规划，决心使生铁产量在近期内来一个大飞跃。
    为此，记者特请冶金工业部负责人谈了河南省创造生铁高产纪录的巨大意义和主要经验。
    负责人说，河南省的生铁产量，从9月份开始上升，到15日，出现了飞跃的新局面。这一天，全省开动了五万多座土高炉；发动了三百六十多万声势浩大的钢铁大军；生产了一万八千六百九十四吨铁（烧结铁尚未计入），这个数字超过了东北全区生铁的日产量；全省出现了八个日产生铁一千吨以上的县。这个成绩是巨大的。
    河南省过去虽然生产土铁，但基础并不好。他们是怎样跃进上去的呢？负责人分析了七个原因。
    第一、政治挂帅、思想教育工作进行得深、透，广大群众已经广泛地发动起来。
    河南省各级党委，曾经用了一个月的时间，在炉前、采矿场和其他钢铁生产现场，发动广大群众开展了一次关于钢铁生产的大辩论。辩论的内容是：（一）能不能完成钢铁生产任务？原料有没有保证？用什么措施来保证完成？（二）有什么困难？怎样克服？（三）你在钢铁工业生产岗位上贡献什么？
    经过广泛、深入的辩论，着重批判了钢铁工业生产上的三种论调（钢铁工业神秘论，对土高炉的怀疑论，条件论）；批判了两个派（促退派、伸手派）和两个主义（分散主义、地方主义）。因此，广大群众大办钢铁工业的决心很大，干劲很足，出现了许许多多动人的事迹。全省三百六十多万钢铁生产大军中，不仅是青壮年，而且有大批妇女，有老太太和十几岁的少年儿童；有人推迟了婚期，决心等待钢铁计划完成以后再结婚；许多人从几十公里甚至一百多公里以外奔赴生产现场。博爱县的钢铁大军从焦作运煤，彻夜不眠。队伍长达六、七里，在秋雨中群众情绪仍很高涨。
    第二、从省委、地委、县委到乡党委，都是第一书记挂帅，亲临前线，日夜不停地指挥钢铁生产
    他们餐风宿露，和千千万万炼铁工人在炉前同吃、同住、同劳动。像15日创造全国各县生铁最高纪录的禹县，五位县委书记和十七位县委委员，分别在四个基点上指挥炼铁，鲁山县各级党委的书记，自己搞了八十三个“书记经验炉”，参加和指导炼铁。为了加强指挥，有的地委会搬到了炼铁重点县去办公，有的县委会搬到钢铁厂办公。
    第三，以土高炉为主大搞炼铁。
    土高炉建设快，不需要什么机械设备，因此，河南省在短期内建成了七万座土高炉，使生铁产量很快出现了飞跃局面。目前全省还正在建设三万座土高炉，计划再建二万座土高炉。等到这十二万座土高炉全部建成后，即使有一半保持正常生产，每天也能产铁三万吨。河南省这次生铁高产纪录充分证明，大力建设土高炉并力求大部分土高炉正常生产，这是当前使生铁产量向前飞跃的一条捷径。
    第四，生产准备工作，主要是运输工作和原料供应工作做得好。
    全省动员了各种车辆四十二万辆，参加钢铁生产的运输工作，规模空前。在此以前，全省修通了三条通往山区和矿区的主要公路，修筑了九千五百公里简易公路和七万多公里大道和驮运道，为钢铁元帅开路。许多地区成立了运输指挥部、大车师、马车师等，加强运输的组织和调度工作。原料供应方面，各地做到了有足够的铁矿石和煤炭储备。禹县在13日下午和晚上，发动干部做了十五万斤炼铁需用的煤球；宝丰县为了力争炼铁高产，建立了三千多个煤炭窑、砖瓦窑、石灰窑和机械厂，以备建炉、炼铁之需。
    第五，各地创造了许多好的经验、好的工作方法，直接推动了这次高产纪录。
    像禹县创造的炼铁炉的“七定”（定领导、定任务、定时间、定设备、定质量、定劳力、定安全），鲁山县提出的“三变”（工厂变课堂、钢铁生产的奇迹变教材、休息变劳动）等，都是好的工作方法，可以推广。
    第六，全省农业生产大跃进和实现公社化以后，解放了大批农村劳动力，这就为全民大搞钢铁，创造了有利条件。
    第七，山区和平原，互相支援协作。
    负责人最后说，河南省是全国生铁生产的一面红旗，它的生铁产量在目前各省、市中遥遥领先。这次创造的高产纪录，为全国各地钢铁生产提供了许多有益的经验。特别是对土高炉还抱有怀疑的人，是会在这里得到很好的经验的。现在，河南省正在乘胜前进，准备在钢铁生产战线上放出更大的“卫星”，取得更大的丰产。我们预计其他的地区也将要赶上去，并放出钢铁的丰产“卫星”。
