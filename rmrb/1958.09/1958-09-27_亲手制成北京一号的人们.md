The people who personally made Beijing No. 1
Hang Wen
Whether it's day or night, the scorching noon or the cool morning, when people pass by the gate of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics workshop, they can't help but be attracted by the moving scene of the fuselage section. Seeing this shimmering fuselage, seeing these heroes climbing on the jig day and night, seeing every spar, every piece of skin, every small rivet, one cannot help but feel unspeakable excitement and pride! But what is even more worthy of pride are the heroes who made the fuselage.

If you have the opportunity to enter the workshop, in the cockpit at the front of the fuselage, you will find a medium-sized girl, bending over and riveting intently. This is Yuan Donglin, the leader of the front section's Party group. Her eyes shine on her thin face, and she has put so much effort into Beijing No. 1! From morning to dusk, from night to dawn, she works continuously, sometimes for dozens of hours. Even during her meal break, she is reluctant to go back. She just nibbles on a hard bread at the kiosk, and while nibbling, she discusses work with her comrades. August 14th was a tense day and night. She and Zeng Bingheng did not come down from the jig for twenty-four hours. After a day and night of intense fighting by her and her comrades, the bright and shining nose appeared in the workshop.

Section Chief Xue Dali not only worked overtime to rush the work, but also had to plan and arrange the work in an all-round way. The cycle was so short. The joints didn't arrive, the main beam had problems. He worried about manpower, work tools, and the critical problems of the middle section. Who knows how many sleepless nights he spent. I remember that the first skin of the tail section was riveted by him and Chen Zhiji. One hammered, one bucked, echoing each other. With the sound of the riveting gun, rows of neatly arranged silver stars appeared under their hands. What superb craftsmanship, what coordinated cooperation. After the first skin was riveted, they touched the skin and stroked the rivets, reluctantly leaving. In the past few days, a young man with a bandage on his head was often seen working on the jig at the front of the fuselage. This was Cai Mingyuan, who was injured by the riveting gun. He is particularly careful in his work and has never had a quality accident. He is very cautious about drilling every hole and riveting every nail. He knows how much political significance each hole and each nail has! He loves his work, loves Beijing No. 1, and although his injury is serious and he should rest, he can't lie down. He came to the workshop the day after he was injured. Because the vibration was too severe, the leaders absolutely forbade him to go up on the jig. He touched the spars and flipped through the drawings. On the third day, he finally got into the fuselage and picked up the riveting gun again.

Speaking of the fuselage section, people will always think of the fuselage beam assault team. As early as the early days of the establishment of the assault team, Liu Wanying overcame many difficulties in order to get the steel! Under the scorching sun, he ran to Nanyuan. First, the documents were incomplete, and then it was not office hours. He waited anxiously until the afternoon. After a great deal of effort, the steel plate was obtained, three meters long and one and a half meters wide. There was no flatbed truck, and the tricycle was too short. Thinking that the team members were waiting for materials, Master Liu couldn't wait to carry it and run home. But it was impossible. Later, wooden sticks were tied to the tricycle, and stones were hung on the handlebars. One person pulled and one person pushed, and that's how it was transported from Nanyuan to the school. The steel plate arrived and needed to be worked on immediately. It was sent to the sheet metal shop, and then transferred to the factory, which would take five days. Five days was simply a long year for the beam assault team. The fuselage was waiting for the beam, and the final assembly was waiting for the fuselage. No, they had to do it themselves. So the heroic beam assault team helped the sheet metal workers to cut and scribe at the same time; then they transferred to the factory to saw steel plates and remove burrs, sawing and milling at the same time. The work of five days was finally completed in two days.

In the later stage of the work, the most intense battle was in the middle section of the fuselage. People will not forget that earth-shattering night. More than forty people crowded the fuselage, inside and outside the frames, above and below the jigs, left, right, front, and back, holding riveting guns, carrying pneumatic drills. Everywhere were soldiers, everywhere was tension and joy, presenting a decisive and also a victorious stage. Team leader Chai Wenyu commanded while fighting. The workshop director and the Party branch secretary also came to the battlefield and climbed onto the jig. Director Wu of the workshop is an old hand. He rivets when he says rivet, and bucks when he says buck. Secretary Jiao made up for what was missing, discovered the key problems while working, proposed measures to promote production, pointed out the direction, and ensured the victory of the battle.

The heroic ode cannot be sung completely. There is also team leader Wu Chunshu, who worked continuously for forty-eight hours, and all the comrades in the tail section who did not get off the jig for thirty hours. They said: If the work is not finished, we will not leave work. Chen Wanming worked while sick until she fainted. Zhu Shangchi fought fiercely all night and slept next to the fuselage before dawn. Many fourth-year students, although their skills were not proficient, proposed "Obey the distribution and do not be picky," closely cooperated with the masters, and took the initiative to find work. There were also designers who went deep into the workshop to actively discover problems and help solve them; and many, many soldiers who silently buried themselves in hard work, many, many comrades whose names could not be called. So let's call these soldiers our nameless heroes!

    亲手制成北京一号的人们
    航文
    无论是白天或是黑夜，无论是酷热的中午或是清凉的早晨，当人们走过北京航空学院车间门口的时候，就会不由自主地被机身段的动人场面吸引。看到这银光闪闪的机身，看到这不分昼夜攀登在型架上的英雄们，看到这每一根桁条、每一块蒙皮、每一颗小小的铆钉，都会有说不出的兴奋和骄傲！但是，更使人值得自豪的是制造机身的英雄们。
    如果有机会走进车间，在机身前段的座仓里，你就会发现一个中等身材的姑娘，弯腰躬身在紧张地铆接，这就是前段的党小组长袁冬林。她瘦瘦的脸上眼睛闪着光，为了北京一号，她花费了多少心血啊！从早晨到黄昏，从夜晚到黎明一干一个连轴转，一干就是几十小时。就连吃饭的这一会，她也舍不得回去，就在小卖部啃个硬面包，而且一边啃一边和同志研究工作。8月14日，那是一个紧张的日夜，她和曾秉衡二十四小时没有下架。经过她和同志们一昼夜的紧张战斗，明晃晃的机头呈现在车间。
    工段长薛大礼，不仅加班加点突击工作，而且得全盘规划安排工作。周期这样短，接头不来，大梁有问题，为人力、为工县、为中段关键问题，谁知道他熬过了多少个通宵。记得尾段的第一张蒙皮是他和陈植基铆的，一打一顶，彼此呼应，随着哒哒的铆枪声，一行行排列整齐的银星就在手下出现，多么高超的手艺，多么协调的合作。当第一张蒙皮铆完后，他们用手摸着蒙皮，抚着铆钉，恋恋不舍地离开。几天来机身前段的型架上，常常见到一个头扎绷带的年轻人在工作，这就是被铆枪打伤的蔡铭远。他工作特别细心，从未出过质量事故，钻每一个孔，铆每一个钉他都十分慎重，他知道每一个孔每一个钉都具有多么大的政治意义！他爱工作，爱北京一号，虽说伤势较重应该休息，但他躺不住。打伤后的第二天就来到车间，由于震动厉害，领导上决不准他上架。摸摸桁条，翻翻图纸，第三天他终于钻进机身又拿起了铆枪。
    提起机身段，人们总会想起机身大梁突击队。早在突击队成立的初期，为了跑钢材，刘万英师傅克服了多少困难啊！烈日当头，奔跑南苑，先是文件不全，后又不是办公时间，焦急地等到下午。费了九牛二虎之力，钢板弄到了，三公尺长一公尺五宽，平台车没有，三轮又太短，想到队员们在停工待料，刘师傅恨不得扛起来飞跑回家。但是办不到，后来三轮车上绑了木棍，车把上又挂了石头，一人拉一人推就这样从南苑运到学校。钢板来了需要马上工作，送到钣金，后转工厂，周期需要五天。五天，对大梁突击队来说，简直是漫长的一年，机身在等着大梁，总装在等着机身，不行，自己动手干。于是英勇的大梁突击队帮助钣金工边下料边划线；随即转到工厂，锯钢板，去毛刺，一边锯一边铣，五天的工作终于两天完成。
    工作的后期战斗最紧张的是机身中段。人们不会忘记那一个惊天动地的夜晚，四十多个人挤满了机身，隔框里外，型架上下，左右，前后，端着铆枪，提着风钻，到处是战士，到处是紧张愉快呈现出决战而且也是决胜的阶段。柴文余组长边战斗边指挥。车间主任、党支部书记也亲临战地登上型架。车间吴主任是老手、说铆就铆，说顶就顶。焦支书哪缺哪补，一边工作一边发现问题关键，提措施促进生产，指出方向，确保战斗胜利。
    英雄的颂歌是唱不完的。这儿还有连续工作四十八小时的吴春书组长和三十小时不下架的尾段的全体同志，他们说：干不完，不下班。陈婉铭带病工作直到晕倒。朱上池激战一昼夜，黎明前就睡在机身旁边。许多四年级同学虽技术不熟，但提出“服从分配不挑不拣”，密切配合师傅，主动去找工作。还有深入车间主动发现问题并帮助解决的设计员；还有许许多多不声不响埋头苦干的战士，许许多多叫不上名字的同志，那么就称我们的这些战士为无名英雄吧！
