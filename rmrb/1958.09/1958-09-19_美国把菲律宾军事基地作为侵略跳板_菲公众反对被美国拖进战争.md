Xinhua News Agency, September 18th - News from Manila indicates that the United States has effectively transformed its air and naval bases in the Philippines into a rear supply depot for its war provocations in the Taiwan Strait and its support for the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This fact has been further confirmed by the news over the past two or three days of the U.S. towing Chiang Kai-shek's warships, damaged near Quemoy (Kinmen), to the Philippines for repairs, and Chiang Kai-shek's military aircraft frequently flying to the Philippines to obtain supplies and seek refuge.

A U.S. Navy spokesman in the Philippines admitted on the 17th that a Chiang Kai-shek's tank landing craft, the "Chung Hai," which was recently damaged by artillery fire near Quemoy, had been towed to the U.S. naval base in Subic Bay, Philippines, for repairs. A spokesman for the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "embassy" in the Philippines also admitted that "such vessels" frequently undergo repairs at this U.S. naval base. At the same time, U.S. and Philippine defense authorities have also admitted that Chiang Kai-shek's military aircraft fly daily from Taiwan to the U.S. Clark Air Base in the Philippines to pick up military supplies.

The "Manila Chronicle" published on the 17th a suppressed news item from the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force, revealing that on September 12, a Chiang Kai-shek's C-46 transport plane flew from Taiwan and landed at Cape Bojeador in northern Luzon, Philippines. The news stated that the plane was riddled with bullet holes, its right wing was badly damaged, and one of its engines was inoperable. One of the five crew members on board was injured. According to Reuters correspondent in Taipei, Frederick Coleman, citing sources from the Chiang Kai-shek clique today, it was confirmed that this Chiang gang's invading aircraft was shot down while harassing the Chinese mainland.

The "Manila Chronicle" also reported that another C-46 aircraft that flew to the Philippines with the damaged Chiang gang plane continued on to the U.S. Clark Air Base. The next day, it flew back to Cape Bojeador to pick up the five Chiang gang crew members there and return them to Taiwan.

Philippine newspapers and the public are greatly disturbed by the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek clique's use of U.S. military bases in the Philippines as a base for military provocations against China and as a sanctuary for Chiang gang's invading aircraft. They fear that the Philippines will be dragged by the U.S. into a real war with China as a result. Philippine newspapers are launching a wave of protests surrounding the aforementioned events. In the face of a public outcry, Philippine military and political figures have been forced to come forward to appease public opinion.

Philippine Acting Foreign Minister Alcasaren admitted to reporters on the 16th that the Chiang gang aircraft that flew to Cape Bojeador to pick up the Chiang Kai-shek clique's crew members did so "without any permission." He stated that once the news was "confirmed," a "protest" would be lodged with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. According to reports, the Philippine Foreign Ministry has also ordered military authorities to detain the Chiang Kai-shek clique's aircraft "pending clarification of the matter."

However, the Philippine ruling clique, on the other hand, is also defending the U.S. use of Philippine military bases as a supply depot for supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique and as a sanctuary for Chiang gang's aircraft. Philippine Defense Minister Vargas announced on the 17th that it was a "routine matter" for Chiang Kai-shek's military aircraft to fly to the Philippines. He admitted that Philippine authorities had long allowed the Chiang Kai-shek clique to "transport supplies" to U.S. military bases in the Philippines.

According to the "Manila Chronicle," citing sources from the Philippine Foreign Ministry, the U.S. and the Philippines exchanged notes several months ago, allowing Chiang Kai-shek's military aircraft to fly between Clark Air Base and Taiwan. This note stipulated that the U.S. Clark Air Base could "repair vessels of the United States' military allies near the Philippines and meet their other needs."

### 美国把菲律宾军事基地作为侵略跳板  菲公众反对被美国拖进战争

    美国把菲律宾军事基地作为侵略跳板
    菲公众反对被美国拖进战争
    新华社18日讯　来自马尼拉的消息表明，美国实际上已经把它在菲律宾的海空军基地作为在台湾海峡进行战争挑衅和支援蒋介石集团的一个后方兵站。这个事实由于两三天来不断传出的美国把在金门被打伤的蒋介石集团军舰拖到菲律宾修理和蒋介石集团军用飞机频繁地飞到菲律宾运取供应品和避难的消息而更加得到证实。
    在菲律宾的美国海军发言人17日承认，有一艘最近在金门附近被炮火击伤的蒋介石集团的坦克登陆艇“中海号”，被拖到菲律宾苏比克湾的美国海军基地进行修理。蒋介石集团驻菲律宾“大使馆”的发言人也承认“这类船只”到这个美国海军基地进行修理是“经常的”。同时，美国和菲律宾国防部当局也承认，每天都有蒋介石集团的军用飞机从台湾飞到美国在菲律宾的克拉克空军基地来运取军事供应品。
    “马尼拉纪事报”在17日刊登了美国第十三航空队不准发表的一则消息，揭露9月12日有一架蒋介石集团的C—四六型运输机从台湾方面飞到菲律宾的吕宋岛北部的婆洛岬降落。这条消息说，机身上弹痕累累，右翼受了重伤，它的一个引擎不能动了。这架飞机上的五名机上人员中有一人受了伤。据路透社驻台北记者弗雷德里克·科尔曼今天援引蒋介石集团人士的消息证实，这架蒋帮侵略飞机是在中国大陆进行骚扰时被击伤的。
    “马尼拉纪事报”还报道，同这架被击伤的蒋帮飞机一起飞到菲律宾的另一架C—四六型飞机，一直飞到美国克拉克空军基地。它在第二天又折回到婆洛岬，把那里的五名蒋帮机上人员接回台湾。
    菲律宾报纸和公众对于美国和蒋介石集团利用美国在菲律宾的军事基地作为对中国进行军事挑衅和蒋帮侵略飞机的庇护所感到极大的不安。它们害怕菲律宾因此会被美国拖进同中国进行真枪实弹的战争之中。菲律宾报纸正围绕着上述事件掀起抗议的浪潮。菲律宾的军政大员在全国舆论哗然的情况下，也不得不出来缓和舆论。
    菲律宾代理外交部长阿耳卡萨伦16日对记者们承认，飞到婆洛岬把蒋介石集团机上人员接走的那架蒋帮飞机，是“没有得到任何许可的”。他表示一旦消息“得到证实”，就将向蒋介石集团“提出抗议”。据报道，菲律宾外交部也已经命令军事当局把这架蒋介石集团飞机扣留起来，“以待问题得到澄清”。
    但是，菲律宾统治集团在另一方面却又对美国利用菲律宾的军事基地作为支援蒋介石集团的兵站和蒋帮飞机的庇护所进行辩解。菲律宾国防部长瓦加斯17日宣布，蒋介石集团军用飞机飞到菲律宾是“例行事项”。他承认，菲律宾当局早已允许蒋介石集团到美国在菲律宾的军事基地“载运补给品”。
    据“马尼拉纪事报”引菲律宾外交部的消息透露，美国和菲律宾在几个月前曾经互换照会，允许蒋介石集团军用飞机在克拉克机场和台湾之间飞行。这个照会规定，美国的克拉克空军基地可以“为美国在菲律宾附近的各军事盟国的船只进行修理和满足它们的其他需要”。
