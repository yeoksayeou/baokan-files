Comprehensive report from our newspaper based on Xinhua News Agency reports: Following the announcement of the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria on the 19th, it has been warmly welcomed and supported by Asian and African countries and peoples.

On the 19th alone, the governments of the United Arab Republic, Iraq, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, and Yemen formally announced their recognition of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria.

President Nasser of the United Arab Republic wrote a letter to Abbas, the Prime Minister of the Algerian Provisional Government, congratulating him on the establishment of the Republic of Algeria.

In his congratulatory letter, President Nasser said, "We are confident that all Arab people regard the victory of the Algerian people as the victory of Arab nationalism. We are also confident that people with a just moral conscience in the world will regard this as a victory for freedom and the principle of national self-determination."

Damascus newspapers and radio stations warmly welcomed the birth of the Republic of Algeria, considering it a victory for Arab nationalism and a blow to imperialism.

The editorial of "Al-Jamahir" ("The Masses") stated that first, the declaration of the Republic of Algeria and the recognition of this republic by Arab governments can be regarded as a serious answer to the conspiracies of Washington, London, and Paris, which aim to link North Africa with NATO or the proposed Western Mediterranean Pact.

The "Sawt al-Arab" ("Voice of the Arabs") newspaper, in its editorial, welcomed the birth of the Republic of Algeria, considering it "a new and successful step taken by the Algerian National Liberation Front in its struggle against imperialism."

The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council issued a call on the 19th, urging Asian and African people to actively support the newly established Provisional Government of Free Algeria and demanding that their respective governments immediately recognize this new regime.

The call stated: "The establishment of this free government is another victory for the people of free countries and a heavy blow to imperialism."

Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio stated on the 20th that he welcomed the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. He pointed out that this event shows that the Algerian people are fully determined to carry out their struggle for national independence. He also said that the Indonesian representative to New York has been instructed to contact representatives of various countries there in order to give them collective and maximum possible support in the current stage of the Algerian people's national struggle.

Major newspapers in Jakarta all prominently published the news of the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria on the front page on the 20th and unanimously welcomed and supported this new provisional government. "Harian Rakjat" ("People's Daily") wrote in its editorial that the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria is not only a major event for the Algerian people but also a major event for all anti-colonialist people.

Political figures in Delhi welcomed the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria in Cairo. Arab figures here believe that this event is a milestone in the history of the development of Arab nationalism.

King Cainu of Mauritania, West Africa, congratulated the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria at a press conference held at the African Association in Cairo.

However, the French government is doing its utmost to prevent other countries from recognizing the Algerian Provisional Government. A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson said at a press conference on the 19th that any country that recognizes the newly established Algerian government would be regarded as an "unfriendly act" towards France. The spokesperson even threatened to break off diplomatic relations.

The British and West German governments have adopted a hostile attitude towards the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, announcing that they will not recognize the government.

    宣布承认阿尔及利亚临时政府
    亚非舆论祝贺阿尔及利亚人民斗争进入新阶段
    本报综合报道据新华社消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府19日宣布成立后，得到了亚非国家和人民的热烈欢迎和支持。
    就在19日一天中，阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克、利比亚、突尼斯、摩洛哥和也门等国政府已经正式宣布承认阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府。
    阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔写信给阿尔及利亚临时政府总理阿巴斯，祝贺阿尔及利亚共和国成立。
    纳赛尔总统在贺信中说，我们确信，所有阿拉伯人民都认为阿尔及利亚人民的胜利就是阿拉伯民族主义的胜利。我们还确信，世界上具有公正的道义心的人们都会认为这是自由和民族自决原则的胜利。
    大马士革的报纸和电台热烈欢迎阿尔及利亚共和国的诞生，它们认为这是阿拉伯民族主义的胜利，并且是对帝国主义的一个打击。
    “群众报”的社论说，首先，阿尔及利亚共和国的声明以及阿拉伯各国政府对这个共和国的承认可以被认为是对华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎的阴谋的严重回答，这些阴谋的目的是要把北非同北大西洋公约组织或者同拟议中的西地中海公约联系起来。
    “阿拉伯之声报”在社论中欢迎阿尔及利亚共和国的诞生，它认为这是“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线在反对帝国主义的斗争中所采取的新的成功的步骤。”
    亚非人民团结理事会书记处19日号召亚非人民积极支持新成立的自由阿尔及利亚临时政府，并且要求他们的本国政府立即承认这一新政权。
    号召书说：这个自由政府的建立是自由国家的人民又一次的胜利，是对帝国主义的沉重打击。
    印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约20日表示欢迎阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府成立。他指出，这件事表明，阿尔及利亚人民有充分的决心进行他们争取民族独立的斗争。他又说，印度尼西亚驻纽约代表已经奉命同那里的各国代表进行接触，以便在阿尔及利亚人民现阶段的民族斗争中给予他们集体的和最大可能的支持。
    雅加达各主要报纸20日都在第一版以显著版位刊载阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府成立的消息，并且一致地欢迎和支持这个新生的临时政府。“东星报”在社论中写道，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立，不仅是阿尔及利亚人民的重大事件，而且也是所有反殖民主义人民的重大事件。
    德里的政界人士欢迎阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府在开罗成立。在这里的阿拉伯国家的人士认为，这件事是阿拉伯民族主义发展史上的一个里程碑。
    西非洲毛里塔尼亚王公卡伊努在开罗的非洲人协会内举行的记者招待会上祝贺阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立。
    但是，法国政府竭力阻挠其他国家承认阿尔及利亚临时政府。法国外交部发言人19日在记者招待会上说，任何国家承认新成立的阿尔及利亚政府，都将被认为是对法国的“不友好行动”。这个发言人甚至以断绝外交关系作为恫吓。
    英国和西德的政府对阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府采取敌视的态度，它们宣布将不承认这个政府。
