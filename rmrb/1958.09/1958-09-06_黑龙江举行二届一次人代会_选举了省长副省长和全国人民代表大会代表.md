Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 5th. The first session of the Second Heilongjiang Provincial People's Congress concluded on the afternoon of the 3rd, lasting seven days. The meeting resolutely supported the call of the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In accordance with the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction, it fully discussed the issue of leading the people of the province to achieve a great leap forward in industry, agriculture, and all other aspects of work.

The meeting held that after Heilongjiang Province overfulfilled its first Five-Year Plan, the industrial output value has accounted for 63.1% of the total industrial and agricultural output value, and has formed a powerful heavy industrial region. Agriculture, forestry, and other aspects of work have also greatly developed. In the future, in the nationwide great leap forward, it is necessary to strengthen communist collaboration, support each other, closely cooperate, and under the centralized and unified leadership of the Central Government, fully exert all potential and vigorously support the development of brother regions. Based on this spirit, the representatives proposed to do everything possible to vigorously develop the iron and steel and machinery industries, and correspondingly develop electricity, petroleum, transportation and light industry, and gradually build Heilongjiang Province into a basic and complete industrial system with metallurgy, machinery, chemicals, electricity, fuel and building materials as the backbone. To this end, it is necessary to take steel as the key link and quickly make up for the deficiency in steel. In terms of production, the iron and steel industry should adopt the method of decentralized iron smelting and centralized steelmaking, and actively develop small blast furnace clusters; at the same time, build large and medium-sized iron and steel joint enterprises according to resource conditions. In order to develop the iron and steel industry, it is also necessary to actively develop the machinery industry related to the iron and steel industry; and carry out the mining and smelting of copper and aluminum. In terms of industrial investment and material distribution, priority should be given to ensuring the development of the "two marshals" (steel and machinery), the "two pioneers" (electricity and transportation) and the "one vanguard" (geology).

The meeting also made a detailed discussion on the great leap forward in agricultural production. The meeting unanimously held that the main ways to increase grain production are the seven links of sufficient water, full fertilizer, deep plowing, close planting, fine seeds, field management and mechanization. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to vigorously carry out tool reforms centered on agricultural mechanization and electrification; basic construction centered on water conservancy and fertilizer; and cultivation and planting technology reforms centered on deep plowing and close planting. The meeting proposed that water conservancy should be realized throughout the province this winter and next spring, so that in the absence of particularly severe natural disasters, floods and droughts will be basically eliminated next year, and small rural hydropower stations should be actively developed in conjunction with water conservancy construction. The meeting also called for gradually adjusting the crop planting ratio according to the increase in grain production.

The meeting held a heated discussion on the establishment of people's communes. The meeting held that with the rapid development of productive forces and the unprecedented improvement of the people's awareness, Heilongjiang Province, like other parts of the country, has seen the inevitable trend of establishing people's communes. At present, on the basis of the masses' conscious willingness, the smaller agricultural cooperatives should be merged and transformed into people's communes.

At the meeting, Li Fanwu was elected as the Governor of Heilongjiang Province, Yang Yichen, Wang Yilun, Li Yanlu, Chen Lei, Du Guangyu, Fan Ziwen, Chen Jianfei, and Wang Qingzheng were elected as Vice Governors, Ouyang Qin and other thirty-two people were elected as members of the Provincial People's Committee, and Liu Zhengwen was elected as the President of the Heilongjiang Provincial Higher People's Court. The meeting also elected Yu Kaiquan, Wang Zhen, Wang Ximing, Wang Sunci, Mao Cheng, Bayanhu, Ma Hengchang, Ma Yongshun, Bai Xiqing, Deng Guozhang, Shi Zengrong, Liu Peizhi, Liu Changrui, Ren Zhongyi, Li Fanwu, Li Yanlu, Su Guangming, Lin Na, Jin Baishan, Yang Xianting, Xu Zhifen, Liang Jun, Gao Chongmin, Guo Jiyun, Lu Ping, Tao Shufan, Cui Guoshan, Han Youtong, and Chu Yinghuang and other twenty-nine people as deputies from Heilongjiang Province to the Second National People's Congress.

　　黑龙江举行二届一次人代会
    选举了省长副省长和全国人民代表大会代表
    新华社哈尔滨5日电　黑龙江省第二届人民代表大会第一次会议历时七天，在3日下午闭幕。会议坚决拥护中共中央政治局扩大会议的号召，根据党的社会主义建设总路线的精神，充分讨论了领导全省人民在工农业和各方面工作中实现大跃进的问题。
    会议认为：黑龙江省在第一个五年计划超额完成以后，工业产值已占工农业总产值的63.1％，已形成为强大的重工业地区。农业、林业及其它各方面的工作也都有了很大的发展。今后在全国大跃进中，要加强共产主义协作，互相支援，密切配合，在中央集中统一领导下，充分发挥一切潜力，大力支援兄弟地区的发展。根据这个精神，代表们提出要千方百计地大搞钢铁和机械工业，相应发展电力、石油、交通运输和轻工业，逐步把黑龙江省建设成为以冶金、机械、化学、电力、燃料和建筑材料为骨干的基本完整的工业体系。为此，要以钢为纲，很快补上钢铁这项缺门。钢铁工业在生产上要采取分散炼铁、集中炼钢的方法，积极发展小高炉群；同时，根据资源情况建设大中型钢铁联合企业。为了发展钢铁工业，还要积极发展同钢铁工业相联系的机械工业；并进行铜、铝的开采和冶炼。在工业投资和材料分配上，首先要保证两个元帅（钢铁、机械）、两个先行（电力、运输）和一个尖兵（地质）的发展。
    会议对农业生产大跃进也作了详尽的讨论。会议一致认为，粮食增产的主要途径就是水足、肥饱、深翻、密植、良种、田间管理和机械化等七个环节。因此，今后要大力开展以农业机械化、电气化为中心的工具改革；以水利、肥料为中心的基本建设；以深耕、密植为中心的耕作栽培技术改革。会议提出，今冬明春要在全省实现水利化，做到在没有特大自然灾害的情况下，明年就基本消灭水旱涝灾，并结合兴修水利积极发展农村小型水电站。会议还要求根据粮食增产的情况，逐步调整作物种植比例。
    会议对建立人民公社问题进行了热烈的讨论。会议认为，随着生产力迅速发展，人民群众的觉悟空前提高，黑龙江省和全国各地一样，已经出现了建立人民公社的必然趋势。目前要在群众自觉自愿的基础上，把规模较小的农业社合并转变成为人民公社。
    会上选举了李范五为黑龙江省省长，杨易辰、王一伦、李延禄、陈雷、杜光预、范子文、陈剑飞、王清正为副省长，欧阳钦等三十二人为省人民委员会委员，刘正文为黑龙江省高级人民法院院长。会上还选举了于开泉、王震、王喜明、王孙慈、毛诚、巴彦胡、马恒昌、马永顺、白希清、邓国章、石增荣、刘佩芝、刘长瑞、任仲夷、李范五、李延禄、苏广铭、林纳、金白山、杨显亭、徐志芬、梁军、高崇民、郭霁云、陆平、陶淑范、崔国山、韩幽桐、褚应璜等二十九人为黑龙江省出席第二届全国人民代表大会的代表。
