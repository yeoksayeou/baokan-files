    Several Questions Regarding Rural Canteens
    Hebei Provincial Party Committee Mass Collective Living Office

    Q: What principles should be followed when establishing canteens?
    A: Experiences in various regions have proven that the principles of voluntary participation by the masses, being beneficial to production, and providing convenience to the masses must be adhered to when establishing canteens. Establishing canteens is a major change in the living habits of the masses. Before starting to establish canteens, thorough ideological mobilization work must be done. Through methods such as airing views, debates, experience introductions, on-site visits, explaining policies, and specific calculations, the significance of establishing canteens should be promoted, so that the masses consciously and voluntarily participate in the canteens.

    Establishing canteens should also adhere to the principles of being beneficial to production and providing convenience to the masses. The location of the canteen should be chosen in a place convenient for the masses to eat and collect meals. The size of the canteen should be determined according to the size of the production team, generally suitable for 30 to 40 households, or 50 to 60 households, and 70 to 80 households are also acceptable. In mountainous and grassland areas where residences are too scattered, the size can be appropriately reduced, and uniformity should not be forced.

    Q: How to consolidate canteens?
    A: In addition to establishing management organizations and formulating necessary rules and regulations, members should be regularly educated on collectivism and communism to raise their awareness and make them consciously cherish canteen utensils and property, and abide by canteen discipline. Secondly, democratic management should be implemented. On the one hand, the responsible cadres of the management committee should frequently go deep among the masses, listen to the members' reflections and opinions on the canteen at any time, and continuously study and improve management methods to improve the quality of meals to the satisfaction of the members. On the other hand, methods such as airing views, debates, and big-character posters should be frequently used to reflect the opinions of the masses, carry out commendation and criticism, establish righteousness, and eliminate evil. Again, the key to consolidating the canteen lies in regulating life well, so that members can eat their fill and eat well.

    Q: How to improve canteen meals?
    A: In addition to improving the cooking skills of the cooks, adjusting the variety, and making the meals innovative, the more important thing is to prepare a large amount of fresh and dried vegetables and frequently available pickles. In addition to planting a large number of vegetables, each canteen should also collect wild vegetables, dry them, and store them.

    Q: How to gather grain when establishing a canteen?
    A: Before the autumn harvest, each household should hand over its grain to the canteen according to consumption quotas, and the canteen will issue meal tickets based on the value of the grain; households short of grain should hand over their grain purchase certificates to the canteen. For households that have indeed eaten too much grain and have not handed over enough consumption quotas, they should be treated differently according to the circumstances, and methods such as "handing in more and eating more, handing in less and eating less" or "eating in different grades" should not be adopted. Those who have indeed wasted grain can be educated to pay attention to saving in the future. Those who have indeed eaten more than their share due to their large appetite can promote the communist spirit and solve the problem through mutual adjustment. After the big autumn harvest, the members' food rations can be uniformly withheld and transferred to the canteen. If a member withdraws from the canteen halfway, the canteen should issue the grain according to the quota.

    Q: How to solve the problem of canteen funds?
    A: Public canteens should have a certain amount of cash as expenses for buying vegetables, oil, salt, etc. Because the management methods of canteens vary from region to region, the methods for solving cash are also different. From the methods solved in various places so far, there are the following:

    One is to apportion the amount according to the amount of grain used by each household and per capita. Those with cash can apportion the cash, and those without cash can be advanced by the cooperative for the canteen to use, and deducted during settlement after the autumn harvest; the other is that the expenses for vegetables, oil, salt, etc. are not collected from the members, but are solved by the canteen from the saved grain; another is to mobilize members to hand over the oil, salt, etc. stored at home to the canteen, which will be priced and issued to the members as meal tickets.

    Q: What if members raise pigs?
    A: Collective pig raising is the direction of future development. With the realization of canteenization, the collective pig raising cause has been further promoted. If some members encounter difficulties in raising pigs individually and are willing to hand them over to the cooperative for feeding, and the cooperative has the conditions for collective feeding, they can be converted into shares and handed over to the cooperative for unified feeding. If some cooperatives do not have collective feeding conditions temporarily, they can be converted into shares and handed over to the cooperative for household feeding, with the cooperative supplying fine feed and the household collecting roughage, and the cooperative giving the household appropriate remuneration. It can also be adopted by the team having ownership with the household raising them. If members have the feeding conditions and are unwilling to hand them over to the cooperative for feeding, they can also feed them themselves. No matter which method is adopted, attention should be paid to being conducive to the development of the pig raising cause and facilitating the accumulation of manure.

    Q: What if members don't cook and don't have warm kang to sleep on?
    A: Some areas have the custom of sleeping on warm kangs, which is a practical problem in the lives of the masses and must be solved. Agricultural cooperatives can distribute some hard-stemmed firewood to members during the autumn harvest distribution; in mountainous areas, members can be organized to collectively collect firewood; if some areas have difficulties in burning firewood, some coal can be appropriately supplied. In order to save firewood, some households can voluntarily share a kang.

    关于农村食堂的几个问题
    河北省委群众集体生活办公室
    问：办食堂应掌握什么原则？
    答：各地经验证明，办食堂必须掌握群众自愿、有利生产、便利群众的原则。办食堂是群众生活习惯的一个重大变革，在开始建立食堂前，要充分做好思想发动工作，通过鸣放辩论、经验介绍、现场参观、交代政策、具体算账等办法，宣传办食堂的意义，使群众自觉自愿地参加食堂。
    办食堂还应掌握有利生产，便利群众的原则。食堂地点要选择群众就食、打饭方便的地方。食堂规模要根据生产队的大小确定，一般以三、四十户，五、六十户为宜，七、八十户的也可以。在居住过于分散的山区、草原区，也可以适当缩小，不必强求一致。
    问：怎样巩固食堂？
    答：除了建立管理组织和制定必要的规章制度外，应对社员经常进行集体主义和共产主义的思想教育，提高他们的觉悟，使之自觉地爱护食堂器具、财物，遵守食堂纪律。其次，要贯彻民主管理。一方面管理委员会的负责干部应该经常深入群众，随时听取社员对食堂的反映和意见，不断研究改进管理方法，提高饭菜质量，达到社员满意。另一方面，要经常采用鸣放、辩论和大字报的方法，反映群众意见，进行表扬批评，树立正气，消除邪气。再次，巩固食堂的关键在于调剂好生活，使社员吃饱吃好。
    问：怎样改善食堂伙食？
    答：改善伙食的办法，除了提高炊事员的做饭菜的技术，调剂好样品，让饭菜花样翻新以外，更重要的是大量准备干鲜菜和常备咸菜。各个食堂除了大量种植蔬菜以外，还应该采集野菜，晒干储备起来。
    问：成立食堂怎样凑粮食？
    答：秋收前每户都要按消费指标把自己的粮食交给食堂，由食堂折款发给饭票；缺粮户要将购粮证交给食堂。对确实吃了过头粮，交不够消费指标的户，要分别情况区别对待，不要采用交多吃多，交少吃少或分等吃饭的办法。对确实浪费了的，可给予教育，今后注意节约。对确实饭量大吃超过了的，可发扬共产主义精神，互相调剂解决。在大秋以后，社员口粮部分，可由社统一扣留转给食堂。如果社员有半路退出食堂的，食堂应按指标照数领给粮食。
    问：食堂资金如何解决？
    答：公共食堂要有一定数量的现金作为买菜、油、盐等费用。因各地区食堂的经营管理办法不同，解决现金的办法也不一样，从目前各地解决的办法中看，有以下几种：
    一种是根据各户、人口用粮多少，按户按人摊纳，有现款者即可摊现款，无现款者由社预支给食堂使用，等秋后结账时扣除；另一种是菜、油、盐等费用不收社员钱，由食堂从节约粮中解决；再一种是动员社员将家中积存的油、盐等交给食堂作价发给社员饭票。
    问：社员养猪怎么办？
    答：集体养猪，是今后的发展方向。随着食堂化的实现，更进一步促进了集体养猪事业。有的社员个人养猪遇到困难，愿意交社喂养，社又有集体喂养条件的，可以折价归社统一喂养。有的社暂时没有集体喂养条件，可以折价归社采取社有户养的办法，细饲料由社供应，粗饲料由户采集，社给户以适当报酬。也可以采取队有户养办法。如果社员有喂养条件，又不愿意交社喂养者，也可自行喂养。不论采取哪种方法，都应注意有利于养猪事业的发展；便于积肥造肥。
    问：社员不做饭，没有热炕睡怎么办？
    答：部分地区的群众有睡热炕的习惯，这是群众切身生活的实际问题，必须设法解决。农业社在秋收分配时，可以将一部分硬秆的柴秸分给社员；在靠山的地区，组织社员集体打柴；有的地区烧柴确有困难的，可适当供应一些煤。为了节省烧柴，有一些户可以自愿地并炕。
