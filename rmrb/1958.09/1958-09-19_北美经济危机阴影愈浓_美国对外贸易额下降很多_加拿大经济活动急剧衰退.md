Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch from Washington: According to a recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce, the US foreign trade volume in the first half of this year has decreased significantly compared to the same period last year. Last year, the US foreign trade volume, calculated at an annual rate, was $20.5 billion, while this year it has fallen to $16.6 billion, a decrease of $3.9 billion, nearly 20%.

During the same period, US trade with the Far East also declined, with imports from the Far East decreasing by approximately 7%, and exports to the Far East decreasing by almost 30%.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch from New York: Reports in the American press indicate that the decline in Canadian economic activity is extremely serious. Despite the implementation of some decisive measures by the government, some construction projects in the industrial sector are still being cut back. Factory owners have already planned to reduce equipment procurement expenses from 2.8 billion Canadian dollars in 1957 to 2.497 billion Canadian dollars. The construction industry production index is only showing some improvement due to housing construction. According to preliminary data, the Canadian government's credit allocation for construction in 1958 exceeds the credit allocation in this area in 1957 by 2%, reaching nearly 6 billion Canadian dollars. As for industrial construction, the total value is expected to decrease by 5% compared to last year.

Agriculture in Canada is also facing a crisis. Although wheat exports increased in the second quarter, the inventory of unsold wheat remains above 16,000 tons.

Another sign of the deteriorating Canadian economic situation is that railway transportation volume decreased by 6.9% in the first seven months of this year compared to the same period last year.

    北美经济危机阴影愈浓
    美国对外贸易额下降很多
    加拿大经济活动急剧衰退
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：据美国商务部最近宣布，今年上半年美国对外贸易额比去年同时期下降了很多。去年上半年美国的对外贸易额按年率计算为二百零五亿美元，而今年则下降到一百六十六亿美元，即下降了三十九亿美元，将近20％。
    同一时期内，美国对远东地区的贸易也下降了，其中来自远东的进口大约下降了7％，对远东的出口几乎下降了30％。
    新华社18日讯　纽约消息：美国报刊的报道表明，加拿大经济活动的衰退情况极为严重。尽管政府采取了一些断然措施，但是工业部门的一些建设工程还是要削减。工厂主已经计划把设备购置费从1957年的二十八亿加元缩减到二十四亿九千七百万加元。建筑业生产指数仅仅依靠修建住宅才有些提高。根据初步材料，加拿大政府在1958年对于建筑业的信贷拨款超过1957年在这方面的信贷拨款2％，即将近六十亿加元。至于工业建筑，预计总值将比去年降低5％。
    加拿大的农业也存在着危机，尽管第二季度小麦的出口量有所增加，但是销售不出去的小麦存量还在一万六千吨以上。
    加拿大经济状况恶化的另一个标志，是铁路运输量在今年七个月内和去年同一时期相比较，减少了6.9％。
