Xinhua News Agency Report from Tokyo: The Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association issued a statement on the 10th, supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait, and on behalf of all overseas Chinese in Japan, firmly demanded that the United States immediately withdraw all armed forces from the Taiwan Strait area.

    The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism has consistently interfered in China's internal affairs in the past, vainly attempting to strangle the Chinese revolution. Since 1950, it has further illegally and forcibly occupied Taiwan and nearby islands, and has continuously created tension in the Taiwan Strait area. In the past three months, U.S. imperialism has not only brazenly sent troops to the Middle East and dispatched fleets to Singapore, but also strengthened its armed forces in the Taiwan Strait area, attempting to expand its aggression against China and create international tension.

    The statement pointed out that this series of actions by the United States has made people all over the world fully recognize the face of U.S. imperialist aggressors.

    The statement pointed out that under the pressure of world public opinion, U.S. imperialism had to accept Premier Zhou Enlai's suggestion and prepare to resume Sino-U.S. talks, but this does not mean that U.S. imperialism will stop its aggression against China from now on. On the contrary, U.S. imperialism may take this opportunity to delay and increase troops and munitions to the Taiwan Strait area. Facts show that the U.S. Seventh Fleet is continuing to violate our country's territorial waters near Kinmen Island. The statement said that peace-loving people all over the world must seriously monitor the movements of U.S. imperialists.

    The statement welcomed the recent statements issued by various Japanese democratic parties and people's organizations condemning the United States for creating tension in the Taiwan Strait area. These statements unanimously opposed U.S. interference in China's internal affairs and demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government not be an accomplice of the United States and drag Japan into war.

    In the statement, the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association, on behalf of all overseas Chinese in Japan, called on all compatriots on Taiwan Island to strengthen the struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and to fight to the end for the great cause of the glorious reunification of the motherland.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 12th: Situ Zan, chairman of the Jakarta Chinese Overseas Associations, said when interviewed by a reporter from the "Life Daily" on the 11th that the overseas Chinese in Indonesia fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait, and strongly demand that the U.S. Seventh Fleet and other armed forces withdraw from Taiwan and other Chinese islands.

    Situ Zan said that the whole world knows that Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, Kinmen and Matsu have been Chinese territory since ancient times, but U.S. imperialism nakedly invaded Chinese territory eight years ago. He said that overseas Chinese in Indonesia strongly demand that the U.S. military withdraw immediately and let the Chinese people solve their own problems.

    Lu Juncheng, vice chairman of the Jakarta Chinese Overseas Associations, condemned with great anger the recent crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in bombing schools in Xiamen and massacring civilians.

    The well-known overseas Chinese figure Chen Longji expressed his wholehearted support for Premier Zhou's statement. He said that Premier Zhou's statement powerfully shows that the Chinese people love peace, but are by no means afraid of war. He said that it is an exercise of their sovereignty for the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and other Chinese territories, and the United States cannot be allowed to interfere arbitrarily.

    海外侨胞热烈拥护周总理声明
    坚决要求美国军队滚出台湾和沿海岛屿
    据新华社讯　东京消息：东京华侨总会10日发表声明，拥护周恩来总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，并且代表全体旅日华侨坚决要求美国立即从台湾海峡地区撤出一切武装部队。
    声明指出，美帝国主义过去一贯干涉中国内政，妄想扼杀中国革命；从1950年以来，它进一步非法武装霸占台湾和附近各岛屿，并且不断在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势。最近三个月来，美帝国主义不仅悍然出兵中东，派遣舰队到新加坡，而且增强它在台湾海峡地区的武装力量，企图扩大对中国的侵略，制造国际紧张局势。
    声明指出，美国的这一连串行动让全世界人民完全认清了美帝国主义侵略者的面貌。
    声明指出，美帝国主义在世界舆论的压力下不得不接受周恩来总理的建议，准备恢复中美会谈，但是这并不意味着美帝国主义从此就会停止对中国的侵略，相反地美帝国主义有可能借此机会拖延时日，以便向台湾海峡地区增加军队和军火。事实表明，美国第七舰队正继续在金门岛附近侵犯我国的领海。声明说，全世界爱好和平的人民必须严重监视美帝国主义者的动向。
    声明对日本各民主党派和人民团体最近先后发表的关于谴责美国在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势的声明表示欢迎。这些声明一致反对美国干涉中国内政，要求岸信介政府不要做美国的帮凶，把日本拖进战争。
    东京华侨总会在声明中代表全体旅日华侨，号召台湾岛上所有同胞加强反对美帝国主义的侵略和蒋介石集团的反动统治的斗争，为光荣的祖国的统一大业奋斗到底。
    新华社雅加达12日电　雅加达中华侨团总会主席司徒赞11日接见“生活报”记者时说，印度尼西亚的华侨完全拥护周恩来总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，并且强烈要求美国第七舰队和其他武装部队撤出台湾和其他中国的岛屿。
    司徒赞说，全世界都知道，台湾、澎湖列岛、金门和马祖自古以来就是中国的领土，但是美帝国主义八年前赤裸裸地侵入了中国领土。他说，印度尼西亚华侨强烈要求美国军队立即撤退，让中国人民自己解决自己的问题。
    雅加达中华侨团总会副主席吕俊诚极为愤怒地谴责蒋介石集团最近轰炸厦门的学校、屠杀平民的罪行。
    著名的华侨人士陈隆吉表示全心全意拥护周总理声明。他说，周总理的声明有力地表明中国人民热爱和平，但是绝不惧怕战争。他说，中国人民解放台湾和其他中国的领土，是行使他们的主权，不能容许美国横加干涉。
