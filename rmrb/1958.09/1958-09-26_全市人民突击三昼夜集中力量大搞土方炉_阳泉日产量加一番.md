The Entire City's People Launch a Three-Day and Night Blitz to Concentrate Efforts on Building Native Blast Furnaces
Yangquan's Daily Output Doubles

(According to the Shanxi Daily) The people of all circles in Yangquan City, after three days and nights of hard struggle, produced 1,259 tons of pig iron on the 21st (including 421 tons of "smothered iron").

Three days earlier—on September 17th—Yangquan City's iron production was 494 tons. In order to ensure that daily output would reach 2,000 tons to greet National Day and oppose the provocations of American imperialism, the Yangquan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party launched a fierce attack on steel production by all the people on the 18th. They concentrated their efforts on building native blast furnaces. On the 17th, there were only 412 native blast furnaces in the city, but by the 21st, this had surged to 2,403. After a large number of native blast furnaces were built, they came up with various methods to quickly put them into production: when there were no tools, all the blacksmiths and carpenters worked hard day and night to rush-produce tools; when crucibles were lacking, they not only worked overtime to produce them, but also tore down crucibles that had been built into walls and embankments in the past; when transportation could not keep up, they organized all the city's automobiles and flatbed carts and put them into the battle. While vigorously building native blast furnaces, the people of the city also created all kinds of iron smelting methods, including open furnaces, casserole furnaces, stove furnaces, kiln furnaces, blacksmith furnaces, etc.

During the battle, the first secretaries of Party organizations everywhere, without exception, stood on the front lines of steel production. Old experts who had labored by native blast furnaces for forty, fifty, or even sixty years also joined the fray. Although many of them were over seventy years old, the surge to vigorously develop the steel industry made them young again. Guo Zhengfu, an elderly "Five Guarantees" member of the Lijiashan People's Commune, is seventy years old this year. When the masses mined, he mined; when the masses built furnaces, he built furnaces, and he competed with young people. The young and middle-aged people were even more energetic. The more than 1,200 peasants who fought day and night in the Donghui Mining Plant had increased their mining efficiency to 3.5 tons per person per day.

    全市人民突击三昼夜集中力量大搞土方炉
    阳泉日产量加一番
    据山西日报消息  阳泉市各界人民经过三昼夜的苦战，在21日生产生铁一千二百五十九吨（其中有四百二十一吨闷铁）。
    在三天之前——9月17日，阳泉市的产铁量是四百九十四吨。为了保证以日产双千吨的行动迎接国庆节，反对美帝国主义的挑衅，中共阳泉市委在18日发动全市人民向钢铁生产发起猛攻。他们集中力量大搞土方炉。17日，全市仅有土方炉四百一十二座，到21日便猛增到二千四百零三座。大批土方炉建起之后，他们为使土方炉迅速投入生产，想了各种各样的办法：没有工具，全体铁木匠便日夜苦干，赶制工具；缺少坩锅，他们除加班赶制外，还把过去垒在墙壁、地堰上的坩锅都拆下来；运输工作赶不上，他们就将全市所有的汽车、小平车都组织起来投入战斗。在大搞土方炉的同时，全市人民还创造了各式各样的炼铁方法，其中包括明炉、沙锅炉、灶火炉、窑炉、铁匠炉等等。
    在战斗期间，各地党组织的第一书记，毫无例外地都站在钢铁生产的最前线。在土方炉旁劳动了四十年，五十年，以至六十年的老专家们，也都上了阵。他们中间虽然有许多人已年过古稀，但大搞钢铁工业的浪潮，又使他们年轻了。李家庄人民公社的“五保”社员郭正富老汉，今年整七十岁，群众采矿，他也采矿，群众建炉，他也建炉，并且和年青人竞赛。青、壮年的干劲更足，在东会采矿厂日夜奋战的一千二百多个农民，采矿效率已提高到每人日产三点五吨。
