Xinhua News Agency, September 29th – He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, held a banquet this evening to welcome overseas returned Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots sightseeing groups.

Vice Premier Chen Yi attended this evening's banquet. He warmly welcomed the returned overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots on behalf of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council. In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke about the domestic and international situation. Talking about the situation of the Great Leap Forward in China, he said that our country is now advancing at an unprecedented speed. We have found a way to create a happy life for hundreds of millions of people, and a path for the motherland to move towards industrialization, agricultural mechanization, electrification, and mastery of modern science and technology. The people have created many miracles in the Great Leap Forward. These creations are not the genius of one person, but the genius of 600 million people. Our nation is now holding its head high.

Vice Premier Chen Yi also firmly condemned the war provocations of U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area. He said that we have always been a peace-loving country. We do not challenge others, but we are absolutely not afraid of war. Finally, he pointed out firmly and powerfully that our current era is not the era of Empress Dowager Cixi, not the era of Yuan Shikai, not the era of Cao Kun, not the era of Chiang Kai-shek, but the era of the great Mao Zedong! We will never succumb to the war threats of U.S. imperialism!

Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech greatly inspired the overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots present, and thunderous applause resounded throughout the venue.

He Xiangning delivered a written speech at the banquet, strongly protesting the tense situation created by U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area. She said that the people of our country must liberate their territories of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu. This is the sacred and inviolable right and duty of the 600 million people of our country. If the U.S. imperialists insist on pursuing their policies of aggression and war, they will inevitably be sentenced to the gallows by the people of the world one day.

He Xiangning then spoke about the leap-forward development of the motherland's socialist construction over the past year and the great contributions made by the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students in the construction. She said that the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students, after the great rectification campaign, are, together with the people of the whole country, actively participating in socialist construction with full confidence. In the vast overseas Chinese hometowns, 100% of the able-bodied returned overseas Chinese relatives have participated in labor; overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese living in towns and cities have also actively participated in labor. In the national effort to run industries, many overseas Chinese hometowns that had no industry in the past have leapt to become industrial towns. For the prosperity of their hometowns and the happiness of their descendants, overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese not only actively invest in supporting industrial construction, but also many of them personally participate in industrial production, vigorously engaging in iron and steel smelting.

He Xiangning said that many facts show that returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students can not only completely follow the socialist road together with the people of the whole country, but also can take the lead in the leap forward and become advanced red banners in various positions. He Xiangning encouraged overseas Chinese and their relatives, and returned overseas Chinese to, under the correct leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction, make another leap forward and contribute even greater strength to socialist construction in the future.

Also present at the banquet this evening were Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, and Liao Chengzhi, Fang Fang, Zhuang Xiquan, Huang Changshui, and Zhuang Mingli, Deputy Directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission.

    新华社29日讯  华侨事务委员会主任何香凝今天晚间举行宴会，欢迎海外归国华侨和港澳同胞观光团。
    陈毅副总理出席了今晚的宴会。他代表中共中央和国务院热情地欢迎从海外归来的侨胞和港澳同胞。陈毅副总理在讲话中谈到了国内外的形势。他谈到国内大跃进的情况时说，现在我们的国家正在以空前未有的速度在前进，我们已经寻找到一条创造几万万人幸福生活的道路，寻找到祖国走向工业化、农业机械化、电气化和掌握现代科学技术的道路。人民群众在大跃进中创造了许多奇迹，这些创造不是一个人的天才，而是六亿人民的天才，我们的民族现在是扬眉吐气了。
    陈毅副总理还坚决地谴责了美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区的战争挑衅行为，他说，我们从来就是爱好和平的国家，我们不向别人挑战，但是我们也决不怕战争。最后他坚决有力地指出，我们现在的时代不是慈禧太后的时代，不是袁世凯的时代，不是曹锟的时代，不是蒋介石的时代，而是伟大的毛泽东的时代！美帝国主义向我们进行战争威胁，我们是决不会在它面前屈服的！
    陈毅副总理的讲话给在场的侨胞和港澳同胞以极大的鼓舞，全场不断响起了雷鸣般的掌声。
    何香凝在宴会上发表了书面讲话，她强烈地抗议美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区制造的紧张局势，她说，我国人民一定要解放自己的领土台湾、澎湖和金门、马祖，这是我国六亿人民的神圣不容侵犯的权利和义务。美帝国主义者如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天被全世界人民处以绞刑。
    何香凝接着谈到过去一年来祖国社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展以及广大归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生在建设中所作出的巨大贡献。她说，广大归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生，经过伟大的整风运动，正和全国人民一道，信心百倍地积极参加社会主义建设。在广大侨乡，有劳动力的归侨侨眷百分之百地参加了劳动；在城镇居住的侨眷归侨，也积极参加劳动。在全民办工业中，不少过去没有工业的侨乡，一跃而成为工业市镇。侨眷归侨为了家乡繁荣，子孙万代幸福，不仅积极投资支援工业建设，而且有许多人亲身投入工业生产，大搞炼铁炼钢。
    何香凝说，许多事实说明归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生不但完全可以和全国人民一起走社会主义道路，而且可以跃进居先，可以成为各种岗位上先进的红旗。何香凝勉励海外侨胞和侨眷、归侨今后在党的正确领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，跃进再跃进，为社会主义建设贡献更大的力量。
    出席今晚宴会的还有政协全国委员会副主席陈叔通，中国致公党主席陈其尤，华侨事务委员会副主任廖承志、方方、庄希泉、黄长水、庄明理。
