    Chairman Mao on the Current Situation at the Supreme State Council Meeting
　　American Aggressors are Putting a Noose Around Their Own Necks
    Our socialist construction is accelerating greatly. From now on, the central and provincial-level leading organs must shift their focus to industry. Agriculture will continue to develop greatly next year. We must warmly welcome and actively lead the people's commune movement.
    The Sino-US ambassadorial talks are about to begin. If both sides have the sincerity to solve the problems, the negotiations may achieve some results.
    Xinhua News Agency, 8th—Chairman Mao Zedong convened the Supreme State Council Meeting, which continued this morning.
    At today's meeting, Chairman Mao Zedong spoke.
    Chairman Mao Zedong said that the current situation is favorable to the people of the world who are striving for peace. When talking about the international situation, Chairman Mao pointed out: The general trend is that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. Chairman Mao said that US imperialism has occupied our territory of Taiwan for nine years, and not long ago it sent its armed forces to invade Lebanon. The United States has established hundreds of military bases in many countries around the world. China's territory of Taiwan, Lebanon, and all US military bases in foreign countries are all nooses around the neck of US imperialism. It is not others but the Americans themselves who made this noose and put it around their necks, and handed the other end of the noose to the Chinese people, the people of Arab countries, and all peace-loving and anti-aggression people in the world. The longer the American aggressors stay in these places, the tighter the noose around their heads will be.
    Chairman Mao Zedong also said that US imperialism is creating tension everywhere in the world in order to achieve its goals of aggression and enslavement of the people of all countries. US imperialism believes that tension is always beneficial to itself, but the fact is that the tension created by the United States is going in the opposite direction of the Americans' wishes. It has played a role in mobilizing the people of the world to rise up against the American aggressors. Chairman Mao said that if the US monopoly capital group insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably be sentenced to death by the people of the world one day. The same will be true of other American accomplices.
    When talking about the domestic situation, Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out that after the great nationwide rectification movement, a vigorous and prosperous atmosphere has emerged throughout the country. Whether in agriculture, industry, culture and education, or other construction undertakings, a great leap forward situation has been formed. Thanks to the joint efforts of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Communist Party, the speed of our socialist construction has been greatly accelerated. Chairman Mao said that in view of the increasing pressure of the rapid development of agricultural production on industry, and also in view of the relatively solid foundation and relatively mature experience in agricultural production and rural work, the focus of our leadership work needs to be shifted from agriculture and rural work to industrial construction in a timely manner. The central and provincial-level leading organs must grasp both industry and agriculture, but from now on, the focus should be on industry. In industry, we must first focus on the iron and steel industry and the machinery industry, because this is the basis for realizing our country's industrialization, agricultural mechanization, and strengthening national defense. Chairman Mao also said that agriculture and rural work cannot be relaxed, and agricultural production will continue to develop greatly next year. Regarding the people's commune movement that is booming across the country, Chairman Mao said that we must adopt a warm welcome attitude and actively strengthen leadership.
    Chairman Mao expressed his hope for the upcoming ambassadorial-level negotiations between China and the United States in Warsaw. He said: If both sides have the sincerity to solve the problems, the negotiations may achieve some results. Now the people of the whole world are watching the negotiations to be held by the representatives of the two countries.
    After Chairman Mao Zedong's speech, Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Vice Premier of the State Council, and Minister of Finance, made a report at the meeting on the state of this year's financial revenue and expenditure, the preliminary arrangements for next year's financial budget, and commercial work. Lu Dingyi, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department, made a report on the development of education this year, our country's socialist education policy, and the issue of cadres participating in physical labor.
    A total of one hundred and one people attended the meeting, including those who had just returned from other places to attend today's meeting: Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chen Boda, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Li Xuefeng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, Li Siguang, Minister of Geology and Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society and Minister of Aquatic Products, Liang Xi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society and Minister of Forestry, and Yan Jici, Director of the Department of Technical Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
    The fifteenth Supreme State Council meeting, which lasted for three days, ended at 2:00 pm today.

    毛主席在最高国务会议上论目前形势
　　美国侵略者把绞索套在自己脖子上
    我国社会主义建设速度大大加快。中央和省一级的领导机关从现在开始要把重点转移到工业方面来。明年农业还要继续大发展。对人民公社化运动要热忱欢迎、积极领导。
    中美大使级会谈即将开始，如果双方具有解决问题的诚意，谈判可能取得某些成果。
    新华社8日讯　毛泽东主席召集的最高国务会议今日上午继续举行。
    在今日的会议上，毛泽东主席讲了话。
    毛泽东主席说，目前的形势对全世界争取和平的人民有利。在谈到国际形势的时候，毛主席指出：总的趋势是东风压倒西风。毛主席说，美帝国主义九年来侵占了我国领土台湾，不久以前又派遣它的武装部队侵占了黎巴嫩。美国在全世界许多国家建立了几百个军事基地。中国领土台湾、黎巴嫩以及所有美国在外国的军事基地，都是套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索。不是别人而是美国人自己制造这种绞索，并把它套在自己的脖子上，而把绞索的另一端交给了中国人民、阿拉伯各国人民和全世界一切爱和平反侵略的人民。美国侵略者在这些地方停留得越久，套在它的头上的绞索就将越紧。
    毛泽东主席又说，美帝国主义在全世界到处制造紧张局势，以期达到它侵略和奴役各国人民的目的。美帝国主义自以为紧张局势总是对它自己有利，但是事实是，美国制造的这些紧张局势走向了美国人愿望的反面，它起了动员全世界人民起来反对美国侵略者的作用。毛主席说，美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。
    毛泽东主席在谈到国内形势的时候指出：经过了伟大的全民整风运动，全国到处出现了蓬勃兴旺的气象。无论在农业、工业、文化教育以及其他建设事业方面，都形成了大跃进的形势。由于全国人民在共产党的领导下共同努力，我国社会主义建设的速度大大加快了。毛主席说，鉴于农业生产的飞跃发展对工业的越来越大的压力，还鉴于农业生产和农村工作方面已经有了比较稳固的基础和比较成熟的经验，我们的领导工作的重心需要适时地从农业和农村工作方面转移到工业建设方面来。中央和省一级的领导机关，必须一手抓工业，一手抓农业，而从现在开始，要把重点放在工业方面。在工业方面，必须首先抓紧钢铁工业和机械工业，因为这是实现我国工业化、农业机械化和加强国防力量的基础。毛主席又说，农业和农村工作不能放松，明年农业生产还要继续大发展。关于目前正在全国蓬勃展开的人民公社化运动，毛主席说，必须采取热忱欢迎的态度，积极加强领导。
    毛主席对于中美两国在华沙即将开始的大使级代表的谈判寄予希望。他说：如果双方具有解决问题的诚意的话，谈判可能会取得某些成果。现在全世界人民都在注视着两国代表将要进行的谈判。
    在毛泽东主席讲话以后，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理兼财政部部长李先念在会上就今年度财政收支情况、明年度财政预算的初步安排和商业工作等问题作了报告，中共中央政治局候补委员、宣传部部长陆定一就今年教育事业的发展情况、我国社会主义教育方针和干部参加体力劳动问题作了报告。
    参加会议的共一百零一人，其中新从外地回来参加今天会议的有：全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国科学院院长郭沫若，中共中央政治局候补委员陈伯达，中共中央书记处书记李雪峰，地质部部长、中国科学院副院长李四光，九三学社中央委员会主席、水产部部长许德珩，九三学社中央委员会副主席、林业部部长梁希，中国科学院技术科学学部主任严济慈。
    历时三日的第十五次最高国务会议已在今天下午二时结束。
