Xinhua News Agency, 29th - Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese "Akahata" published on August 29th an appeal on the issue of Sino-Japanese relations issued on July 19th by Kazami Akira, Chairman of the Japan National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, Hosokawa Karoku, Representative Committee Member of the National Council, Ito Takeo, Director of the National Council, and Nakajima Kenzō, Representative Committee Member of the National Council. This appeal was a reply to a letter written to Kazami Akira by Oyama Ryuko, widow of the late Chairman of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, Oyama Ikuo, and Kawazaki Natsu, Hani Setsuko, Hiratsuka Raichō, and Maruki Toshi, five people in total.

Oyama Ryuko and the other four had written to Kazami Akira on July 14th, expressing their anxiety about the Kishida Nobusuke government's actions in undermining Sino-Japanese friendly relations, and expressing their hope that Kazami Akira would conduct research on the path to developing friendly relations between the people of China and Japan.

The full text of the appeal issued by Kazami Akira and others is as follows:

    Having read Mr. Oyama's letter, we deeply feel responsible for the current state of Sino-Japanese relations. Recently, we have been discussing this matter with friends who share our concerns, and we now present the results of our deep reflections to those who share our worries.

    The recent warning given to our country by the 600 million people of China is not only related to the issue of opening up Sino-Japanese relations in the future, but also has extremely important significance for the future of our nation. However, observing the attitude of our government and people, it can be seen that people often only pay attention to immediate countermeasures, without considering their true significance. In connection with the recent struggles of the people of the Middle East, we believe that it is necessary to understand the current global situation and conduct a deep reflection on the path forward for our nation.

    1. The Sino-Japanese friendly relations that have developed through numerous difficulties are facing a major crisis today, and one of the reasons for this lies in the attitude of our government.

    We must never forget the serious suffering inflicted on the Chinese people during the past war of aggression. Without deep reflection on this issue of humanitarian responsibility, the Japanese nation cannot have a future. The Chinese people once temporarily forgot this resentment, and despite the fact that the two countries were still technically at war, they still extended a friendly hand to our people.

    However, our government has ignored the will of the emerging and vigorous 600 million Chinese people who have risen from suffering, and instead recognizes the Chiang Kai-shek clique that was expelled by them and relies on American power to occupy Taiwan, treating them as the representatives of China. This cannot be described as anything other than insulting the Chinese people and antagonizing the Chinese people. Especially since the establishment of the Kishida Nobusuke Cabinet, on the one hand, it verbally calls for expanding trade out of self-interest; on the other hand, it strengthens relations with Taiwan and, together with Okinawa and South Korea, promotes a policy of encircling China by relying on the threat of nuclear weapons.

    The Chinese people cannot but be angered by this, and have turned to taking a tough stance. This is only natural.

    2. The face of the world has completely changed today. The era in which nations with military and financial power dominate, and maintain strength and prosperity by oppressing other nations, has passed. The current era is one in which only nations that are morally united, committed to fighting for independence and autonomy, and striving for peaceful coexistence with other nations can be respected by the world, and can be strong and prosperous. In particular, the heroic rise of the Asian and African nations, led by China and India, is the emerging light of the world and a strong defender of human peace. These nations are creating new relationships of mutual unity and cooperation under the Bandung spirit.

    At this very moment, our government is following the U.S. policy of strength, deepening relations with Taiwan and South Korea, and embarking on a dangerous path of undermining Asian unity and leading to war. The United States' unreasonable actions against the Arab people have revealed the true meaning of this policy to the whole world.

    As long as we embark on this path, we will not only run the risk of war, but also suffer worrying and serious consequences in the future of the nation, morally, politically, and economically. The dream of seeking prosperity through cunning policies and aggressive actions will inevitably lead to the destruction of the nation itself. It seems necessary to recognize this once again.

    3. On the other hand, it should be admitted that the attitude of the Japanese people, including ourselves, also needs to be deeply reflected upon. Although we acknowledge their good intentions and have made some achievements, it is undeniable that some people only know how to receive the goodwill and active enthusiasm of the Chinese side, and lack serious efforts to reform themselves in terms of national morality and politics, and there is a tendency to try to take advantage of the new world situation. Although there have been many exchanges, once they are hindered by the government, they do not first urge the government to change its attitude, but instead expect the Chinese side to compromise. This attitude of seeming to mediate between the Chinese people and our government is not uncommon. As a result, on the surface, the exchanges between the two countries appear to be very warm and spectacular, but in reality, behind the so-called "being a member of Asia," Japan's role as a source of encirclement of China and division of Asia continues to increase. In the past, we ourselves created a foundation that was easily deceived by the government's deceptive rhetoric of so-called "politics is politics, trade is trade," and this tendency exists.

    In particular, we, who are in a position to be responsible for leading the movement, bear a great responsibility.

    4. There must be no policy of calling for friendship and economic exchanges with China and even Asia on the one hand, while deepening relations with Taiwan and others on the other. If we are willing to be friends with the Chinese people and aspire to seek peace in Asia, we must make efforts to find ways to sever our country's relations with Chiang Kai-shek, who is hostile to the Chinese people and threatens Asian peace, and there is no other way. Unless we make efforts to change our country's policy of dependence on the United States, we will not be able to overcome the difficulties.

    The attempt to oppress other nations by force to obtain benefits, or to abandon self-reform and try to take advantage of the new situation by cunning means, is a pipe dream.

    Promoting political and moral reform at home is the main aspect that we must strive for.

    In order to achieve peace and prosperity, the most important thing is to abandon narrow selfishness and rise up to fight again from the basis of deep reflection. We believe that when all aspects of effort and movement are implemented with the above-mentioned fundamental position and form a great unity, Sino-Japanese relations can be opened up, and the nation can have broad prospects for development.

    岸政府不改变敌对政策  无法打开中日两国关系
    风见章等就中日关系问题发表呼吁书
    日当局妄想以侵略求繁荣  必将招致民族自身的灭亡
    新华社29日讯  东京消息：日本“赤旗报”8月29日刊登了日本恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章、国民会议代表委员细川嘉六、国民会议理事伊藤武雄、国民会议代表委员中岛健藏在7月19日就中日关系问题发表的呼吁书，这项呼吁书是对故日本拥护和平委员会主席大山郁夫的夫人大山柳子和河崎夏、羽仁说子、平冢雷乌、丸木俊子等五人写给风见章的信件的答复。
    大山柳子等五人曾经在7月14日给风见章写信，对岸信介政府破坏中日友好关系的作法表示不安，并且表示希望风见章就发展中日两国人民间的友好关系的道路问题进行研讨。
    风见章等发表的呼吁书全文如下：
    接读大山先生来信，中日关系酿成今天这种地步，我们深感负有责任。近来曾经同担忧此事的朋友们进行商讨，兹将深刻反省的结果告诸同忧之士。
    最近中国六亿人民给予我国的警告，不仅与打开今后中日关系的问题有关，而且对我们民族的前途也有极为重大的意义。但是观察我国政府与民间的态度，可以看出：人们往往只注意眼前对策，而没有考虑其真正意义所在。同最近中近东人民的斗争联系起来看，我们认为必须洞察目前世界大势，对我国国民的前进道路问题，作一深刻反省。
    一、经过重重困难而获得发展的日中友好关系，今天面临重大危机，其原因之一在于我国政府的态度。
    我们决不可忘记过去侵略战争中给予中国人民的严重痛苦。对这个人道上的责任问题缺少深刻反省，则日本民族不可能有将来的发展前途。中国人民曾经暂且忘去这个怨恨，尽管两国关系实际上还处于战争状态，依然向我国人民伸出友好的手。
    可是我国政府却无视这个从苦难中站起来的、新兴旺盛的六亿中国人民的意志，反而承认那个被他们驱逐出去的、依靠美国力量而盘踞在台湾的蒋介石集团，把他们当作中国的代表。这不能不说是侮辱中国人民，敌视中国人民。特别是自从岸信介内阁成立以来。一方面从利害打算口喊要扩大贸易；另一方面则加强同台湾的关系，并且和冲绳、南朝鲜一起，凭借核武器的威胁，推行包围中国的政策。
    中国人民不能不因此激愤，并且转而采取强硬态度。这是理所当然的。
    一、今天世界的面貌已经完全改变。拥有武力和财力的民族占优势、用压迫其他民族的办法来维持强盛和繁荣的时代已经过去。现在的时代是：只有从道义上彼此团结、致力于争取独立自主、为同其他民族和平共处而奋斗的民族才能受到世界的尊敬，而且能够强大和繁荣。特别是以中国、印度为首的亚非各民族的英勇奋起，是世界新兴之光，是人类和平的坚强的维护者。这些民族在万隆精神之下，正在创造着互相团结合作的新关系。
    正当这个时候，我国政府追随美国实力政策，和台湾、南朝鲜加深关系，走上破坏亚洲团结和导致战争的危险道路。美国对阿拉伯人民的无理行动把这种政策的真实意义公之于全世界。
    只要走上这条道路，不但要冒战争危险，而且对于民族的将来也将在道德上、政治上、经济上遭受令人忧虑的严重后果。梦想以狡猾政策和侵略行动寻求繁荣，必将招致民族自身的灭亡。这件事看来有必要再一次加以认识。
    一、另一方面，应该承认，包括我们自己在内，日本民间的态度也有必要加以深刻反省的地方。尽管我们承认其善意并且做出一些成果，但不可否认，人们有些只知领受中国方面的好意和积极热情的态度，在民族道德和政治方面缺乏认真改造的努力，存在着一种企图利用世界新形势的倾向。虽然进行过不少的交流，但一旦受到政府的妨害，却不先去催促政府改变态度，反而期望中国方面妥协。这种似乎在中国人民与我国政府之间居间调解的态度，颇不鲜见。其结果，表面上看来两国交流显得很热烈、壮观，而实际上在所谓“做为亚洲的一员”这句话后面，日本作为包围中国和分裂亚洲的策源地的作用却不断增大。过去我们自己造成一种容易被政府所谓“政治是政治，贸易是贸易”的欺骗言辞所迷惑的基础，这种倾向是存在着的。
    特别是站在应该对领导运动负责的立场上的我们，责任是重大的。
    一、决不能有这种政策：一面口喊要同中国以至亚洲友好和进行经济交流；另一面却和台湾等加深关系。假如愿意同中国人民友好，有志于谋求亚洲和平，则必须努力设法使我国同与中国人民敌对并威胁亚洲和平的蒋介石断绝关系，除此以外别无他路。除非努力设法改变我国依赖美国的政策，否则无法打开难关。
    以实力压迫别的民族以获取利益、或放弃自身改造而想以狡猾的手段乘机利用新形势的企图，都是迷梦。
    促使国内进行政治上道义的改造，这才是我们必须努力的主要方面。
    为了争取和平与繁荣，最重要的是舍弃狭隘的利己心，从深入反省的基础上重新站起来奋斗。我们相信，当所有各方面的努力和运动，都贯彻上述根本立场，并形成大团结的时候，日中关系才能打开，民族才能有广阔发展的前途。
