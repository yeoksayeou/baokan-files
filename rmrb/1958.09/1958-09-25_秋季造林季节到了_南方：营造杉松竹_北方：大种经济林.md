Autumn Afforestation Season Arrives
South: Create Fir, Pine, and Bamboo Forests; North: Plant Economic Forests on a Large Scale

(Our dispatch) The nationwide large-scale autumn and winter afforestation movement will gradually unfold from north to south in October. Currently, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are actively preparing. In some major cities and individual areas in Gansu, Hunan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia, autumn afforestation has already begun.

According to the Ministry of Forestry's plan: the country will afforest 500 million mu of its 1.8 billion mu of barren mountains and wasteland this year, 600 million mu next year, and complete the afforestation task entirely by 1960. Now, according to the plans of the provinces, cities, and districts, most areas can complete the afforestation task by the end of next year.

The achievements of afforestation in the first half of this year are tremendous, with a total of more than 320 million mu afforested nationwide, exceeding the total of the eight years since liberation. In the short rainy season of just over two months, some areas afforested another 50 million mu. Yunnan and Shanxi provinces achieved the greatest success in rainy season afforestation. Most provinces and regions now have even larger plans for autumn and winter afforestation. Yunnan Province afforested more than 29 million mu in the first half of the year and will afforest another 50 million mu in the autumn and winter; Hunan Province afforested more than 20 million mu in the first half of the year and will afforest 45 million mu in the autumn and winter; Hebei Province afforested more than 20 million mu in the past year and will afforest 20 million mu this autumn and winter; the autumn and winter afforestation in Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and other provinces and regions will be doubled or even more compared to the afforestation area in the first half of the year. Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Anhui, Shandong, and other provinces and regions can basically eliminate all barren mountains and wastelands by next spring, with only some finishing touches needed next winter at most.

The scale of planting trees around houses and villages in the vast plain areas during this autumn and winter afforestation will also be very large. Jiangsu Province has already planted more than 7.8 billion trees around houses and villages this year; it plans to plant 100 billion to 130 billion trees this winter and next spring.

In addition to creating large-scale fast-growing timber forests during autumn and winter afforestation, various regions will also create large-scale economic forests. Southern provinces will create large areas of fir forests, pine forests, bamboo forests, and oil-tea forests this winter and next spring. Guangxi will create 10 million mu of oil-tea forests. In addition to creating 4 million mu of timber forests along the coast to eliminate coastal wasteland, Jiangsu will also create more than 1 million mu of mulberry gardens, 1 million mu of orchards, and 1.9 million mu of tea and bamboo gardens in hilly areas. Northern provinces will also plant large quantities of walnuts and peppers in mountainous areas. Each household in Tianshui Prefecture, Gansu, will plant one *sheng* of walnuts, and each production team will plant 100 *jin* of peppers. The afforestation in cities such as Beijing and Tianjin and some other areas has begun to consider landscaping, and Jiangsu has proposed the task of orchardization in hilly areas next year.

Currently, the main preparation work in various regions is collecting tree seeds. More than 100 million *jin* have already been collected nationwide, and efforts are still being made to collect more. Recently, many provinces and regions have held afforestation conferences and are organizing afforestation forces, waiting for the large-scale autumn harvest to be over before carrying out large-scale afforestation.

The People's Commune movement will greatly promote this year's autumn and winter afforestation. People's communes in Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Shaanxi, and other provinces will all set up forestry farms.

    秋季造林季节到了
    南方：营造杉松竹  北方：大种经济林
    本报讯  全国规模巨大的秋冬造林运动，10月就可从北到南逐步展开。目前，各省、市、自治区都在积极准备。个别大城市和甘肃、湖南、四川、陕西、广东、河北、山西、辽宁、内蒙古等省区个别地区，秋季造林已经开始了。
    按林业部规划：全国十八亿亩荒山荒地今年造林五亿亩，明年造林六亿亩，1960年即可全部实现造林的任务。现在，按各省、市、区的规划，大部地区明年年底就可以完成造林任务。
    今年上半年造林的成绩是巨大的，全国共造林三亿二千多万亩，超过解放以来八年的总和。短短两个多月雨季造林部分地区又造了五千多万亩。云南、山西两省雨季造林成绩最大。现在大多数省区秋冬造林的计划更大。云南省上半年造林二千九百多万亩，秋冬要再造五千万亩；湖南省上半年造林二千多万亩，秋冬要造林四千五百万亩；河北省过去一年造林二千多万亩，今年秋冬就要造二千万亩；内蒙古、江西、广西等省区的秋冬造林都要按上半年造林面积翻一番或者更多。广东、广西、四川、安徽、山东等省区明春就可基本上消灭全部荒山荒地，顶多在明年冬天扫尾。
    今年秋冬造林广大平原地区四旁植树的规模也将是很大的。江苏省今年四旁已植树七十八亿多株；今冬明春计划植树一千到一千三百亿株。
    秋冬造林各地除造大规模的速生用材林外，还要造大规模的经济林。南方各省今冬明春要造大面积的杉林、松林、竹林、油茶林等。广西要造一千万亩油茶林，江苏除在沿海造四百万亩用材林消灭沿海荒地外，还要在丘陵地区造桑园一百多万亩、果园一百万亩、茶园和竹园一百九十万亩。北方各省山区也要大种核桃和花椒。甘肃天水专区每户要种一升核桃，每个生产队要种一百斤花椒。北京、天津等城市和一些地区的造林已开始考虑园林化，江苏就提出了明年丘陵地区果园化的任务。
    目前各地的准备工作主要是采集树种，现在全国已经采了一亿多斤，还在大力采集。最近很多省区都开了造林会议，正组织造林力量，只等秋收大忙过后就大规模造林。
    人民公社运动将大大促进今年的秋冬造林。浙江、安徽、湖南、陕西等省人民公社社社都要办林场。
