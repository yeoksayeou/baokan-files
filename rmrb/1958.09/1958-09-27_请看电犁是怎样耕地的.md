Please See How the Electric Plow Works
By Our Correspondent Li Yi

In May and August of this year, I visited the electric plow demonstration of the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences twice. The first time was plowing dry land, the second time was plowing paddy fields, and both were successful.

On a test field of the research institute, an electric winch was placed at the corner of the field, and a control lever was fixed on each side of the field ridge. Two steel cables from the electric winch, through fixed pulleys and traversing pulleys on the two control levers, pulled a two-way plow with four wheels from both ends, that is, from two directions. This is the complete device of an electric plow (electric cable traction plow) (as shown in Figure 1). When the electric plow is working, as soon as the power is turned on, the two-way plow moves straight forward under the traction of the steel cables, and the new soil is turned over. When the plow reaches the end, it automatically moves to the next row and plows back. Watching the electric plow operation demonstration, one deeply feels that the heavy plowing labor of thousands of years has been relieved, and an infinitely beautiful prospect has unfolded from now on.

The method of using electric cable traction for plowing was designed and successfully tested by Zhang Qing, a researcher, Xia Deji, a young research trainee, Xue Hanchen, an old worker, and another young research trainee, Zhou Minlu, of the Agricultural Power Research Office of the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute, based on the principle of wind power traction plowing created in Jiangsu Province. They introduced the design of the electric plow to the reporter in detail.

The entire device of the electric plow, as mentioned above, is divided into three main parts: an electric winch, two control levers, and a two-way plow. The three parts are connected by two steel cables. The electric winch is the power source for traction implements, replacing oxen or tractors. The two-way plow is a plow specially manufactured for cable traction plowing. The control lever is an indispensable intermediate link that controls both the electric winch and the plow.

The electric winch is a new type of electric machine designed by the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute to realize electric traction plowing (as shown in Figure 2). When the motor is started, due to different circuit controls, the winch shaft rotates in two different directions, forward and reverse, so that one winch reels the steel cable back, while the other winch releases the steel cable, pulling the two-way plow back and forth to plow the land.

All cable traction plowing methods cannot do without control levers. Without control levers, two machines would have to be used to pull the two-way plow back and forth at both ends of the field. Now that two steel cables are pulled by one machine, the steel cables must pass through the pulleys installed on the control levers at both ends of the field in order to play the role of pulling the plow. After plowing a piece of land within the range of the control lever, the two control levers are moved forward.

The control lever of the electric cable traction plow has a much greater role. Its traversing pulley has automatic equipment and can move automatically (as shown in Figure 3). When the two-way plow reaches the end of the field, a touch knot on the steel cable just touches the automatic device on the pulley, causing the traversing pulley and the travel limit pin on the control lever to fall off. The steel cable is pulled to the second travel limit pin along the control lever due to the pulling force. In this way, the steel cable pulling the plow moves one row, and another steel cable takes effect to pull the plow back.

The control lever is also a component of the electrical control system circuit, which can control the switch, forward or reverse rotation of the motor. The reason is that the control lever is the ground wire of the motor, and the switch button on the control lever can control the start or stop of the motor by connecting or blocking the current, and connect this circuit or that circuit to control the forward or reverse rotation of the motor.

This complex electrical control process is completed simultaneously during automatic traversing. When the touch knot of the steel cable touches the automatic device of the traversing pulley, and the pulley starts to move along the control lever, it touches a button on the control lever that turns off the motor, thereby blocking the circuit and stopping the motor from rotating. At this time, relying only on the inertial force of the steel cable, the traversing pulley is pulled to the position of the second travel limit pin. When the pulley reaches the second travel limit pin, it opens another button, connects another circuit, and the motor rotates in the other direction again, so another steel cable pulls the two-way plow back to plow the land.

The two-way plow used by the electric plow (as shown in Figure 4), like all plows for cable traction plowing, has two plowshares back-to-back and four wheels in the front and rear, so it is very stable without anyone holding it. The plow frame is also movable, and when the steel cable is pulled, the four wheels move slightly backward to reduce the resistance to forward movement. The same is true when pulling back.

When the reporter first watched the electric plow demonstration in May, I saw a demonstration of pulling a chain nail tooth harrow. This type of nail tooth harrow has straight teeth and is the same whether moving forward or backward. The links connecting the teeth are chains. Whether pulled forward or backward, the center of the pull protrudes forward, making it easy to move forward. The nail tooth harrow is wide and has multiple rows and can be pulled. But the traversing problem of this wide implement has not yet been solved.

At present, the traversing of the electric plow is not perfect. When the traversing pulley moves one row on the control lever, only the steel cable pulling the plow moves, but the plow itself does not move. Only under the pulling force of the steel cable in the plowshare moving back and forth does it slowly enter the second row. Therefore, the beginning section is re-plowed, and the steel cable traversing cannot be moved too wide and cannot be completely moved to the second row according to the plowing width. Therefore, the traversing problem still needs to be further studied and solved.

The research institute compared the electric plow with the tractor and found that the electric plow has the following advantages: First, the electric plow is more efficient than the tractor. A large part of the tractor's power is consumed by its own operation, and only 30%-40% is used for pulling implements. In paddy fields and during the rainy season, the power consumed by its own operation is even greater. The traction efficiency of the electric plow reaches 70%-80%, which is twice as high as that of a tractor when plowing dry land and twice as high when plowing paddy fields. Second, the cost of the electric plow is low. Compared with the Ferguson tractor, which is suitable for both dry land and paddy fields, the cost of fuel and depreciation for the Ferguson is 1.5 yuan per mu, while the cost of electricity and depreciation for the electric plow is at most 0.5 yuan per mu. Third, it saves a lot of steel compared to tractors, and an electric plow is only worth about 500 yuan. Fourth, the operation is simple. Fifth, it has high adaptability. Sixth, deep plowing is more stable and effective than tractors, and there are no shortcomings such as tractors sinking wheels and the chassis touching the ground. People at the research institute said that the electric plow still has problems of re-plowing, vibration, and not serious missed plowing, requires many power lines, and can only plow small plots of land at present, and it is difficult to plow too large plots. It still needs to be improved. But it is basically successful.

The application of electric plows is just the beginning of the use of electricity for field tillage. Zhang Qing and Xia Deji said that we must continue to research and use electricity for all field labor: harrowing, sowing, cultivating, fertilizing, weeding, and harvesting.

    请看电犁是怎样耕地的
    本报记者  黎益
    今年5月和8月，前后两次记者参观了中国农业科学院农业机械化研究所的电犁耕地表演。第一次耕旱地，第二次耕水田，两次都成功。
    在研究所的一块试验地上，地角安放着一部电动绞盘，两头地埂上各固定着一根控制杆。电动绞盘上的两根钢丝绳，通过两根控制杆上的固定滑车和移行滑车，从两头也就是从两个方向，牵着一部有四个轮子的双向犁。这就是一部电犁（电力绳索牵引犁）的全部装置（如图一）。电犁耕作的时候，一接上电源，双向犁就在钢丝绳的牵引下笔直前进，新土就翻起来了。当犁走到尽头，又自动移动一行往回耕作。看了电犁操作表演，使人深深感到解脱几千年的沉重的耕作劳动，从此展开了无限美好的前景。
    电力绳索牵引耕田的办法，是农业机械化研究所农用动力研究室研究人员张清、青年研究实习员夏德济、老工人薛汉臣和另一青年研究实习员周敏露，根据江苏省创造的风力牵引耕田的原理共同设计试验成功的。他们向记者详细地介绍了电犁的设计。
    电犁的全部装置如上所述分三大部分，即一部电动绞盘机，两根控制杆和一部双向犁。三部分由两根钢丝绳结连着。电动绞盘是牵引农具的动力，是代替耕牛或拖拉机的。双向犁是特别为绳索牵引耕地才制造的一种犁。而控制杆是既控制电动绞盘又控制犁的必不可少的中间纽带。
    电动绞盘是农业机械化研究所为实现电力牵引耕地而设计的一种新的电动机器（如图二）。马达开动的时候，由于不同的线路控制，带动绞盘轴作正反不同的两种转动，以达到一个绞盘把钢丝绳绞回，同时另一个绞盘就把钢丝绳放出，拉动双向犁来回耕地。
    一切绳索牵引耕田的办法都离不开控制杆。如果没有控制杆，就必须用两部机器分别在地的两头把双向犁拉来拉去才行。现在两条钢丝绳是由一部机器来拉，钢丝绳就必须通过安装在地两头的控制杆上的滑车，才能够起拉犁的作用。当耕完控制杆范围内的一块地后，再将两根控制杆向前搬动。
    电力绳索牵引犁的控制杆，作用却又大得多。它的移行滑车有自动装备，可以自动移行（如图三）。当双向犁走到地头的时候，钢丝绳上的一个触结恰好触动滑车上的自动装置，使移行滑车和控制杆上的限行肖脱掉，钢丝绳因拉力作用沿着控制杆被拉到第二个限行肖上。这样拉犁的钢丝绳就移动了一行，另一条钢丝绳又起作用把犁拉回来。
    控制杆同时又是电力控制系统线路的组成部分，能控制马达的开关、正转或反转。原因是控制杆就是马达的地线，控制杆上的开关电钮能够通过电流的接通或阻断来控制马达的开动或停止，接通这个线路或者接通那个线路，来控制马达的正转或反转。
    这个复杂的电力控制过程，是在自动移行的过程中同时完成的。当钢丝绳的触结触动移行滑车的自动装置，滑车开始沿着控制杆移行的时候，就触动了控制杆上的一个关闭马达的电钮，从而阻断了线路，停止了马达的转动。这时候仅仅依靠钢丝绳的惰性力量，来把移行滑车拉到第二个限行肖的位置上。当滑车到了第二个限行肖的时候，又触开了另一个电钮，接通了另一个线路，马达又朝着另一个方向转动起来，所以，另一条钢丝绳又拉着双向犁回头耕地了。
    电犁所用的双向犁（如图四），同一切绳索牵引耕作的犁一样，两个犁头背靠背，前后四个轮子，因此没有人把握走得很稳。犁架也是活动的，钢丝绳一拉动四个轮子就略向后移来减轻前进的阻力。往回拉时也是一样。
    5月记者第一次看电犁表演时，正看到了牵引一盘链条钉齿耙耙地的表演。这种钉齿耙是直齿，前进后退都一样。联结各齿的是链条，无论向前拉或向后拉，拉的中心都向前突出而易于前进。钉齿耙是宽幅多行的，可以牵引。但是现在还没有解决这种宽幅农具的移行问题。
    目前，电犁的移行也还不是十全十美的。移行滑车在控制杆上移动一行，只是拉犁的钢丝绳移了而犁本身并没有移，只在犁头往回前进中受钢丝绳的拉力作用才慢慢地进入了第二行，因此开始一段是重耕的，而钢丝绳移行也不能移得太宽，不能按耕作的宽度完全移到第二行上去。因此，移行问题还有待于继续研究解决。
    研究所把电犁和拖拉机作了个比较，发现电犁有以下一些优点：第一是电犁比拖拉机效率高。拖拉机很大一部分动力被本身运转消耗了，曳引农具的只占30％—40％。如果在稻田内和雨季，本身运转消耗的动力就更大。而电犁牵引效率则达70％—80％，耕旱地比拖拉机高一倍，耕水田高两倍。第二是电犁费用低。和水旱两用的福克森拖拉机比，福克森耗油加折旧等每亩成本一元五角，电犁耗电和折旧等每亩成本最多五角。第三是比拖拉机节约钢材很多，一部电犁只值五百元左右。第四是操作简便。第五是适应性高。第六是深耕比拖拉机更稳定、更有效，没有拖拉机陷轮和底盘触地等缺点。研究所的人说，电犁只是还有重耕、震荡和不严重的漏耕现象，需电线很多和目前只能耕小块地，地块太大就有困难，还需继续改进。但是基本上是成功的。
    电犁的运用只是田间耕作用电的一个开端。张清和夏德济说，我们要继续研究，要使田间的一切劳动：耙地、播种、中耕、施肥、除虫、收获都用电。
