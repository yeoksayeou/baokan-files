Let the Land Undergo a Great Transformation

The Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has made deep plowing the center of a series of measures for agricultural production this winter and next spring. The recent national on-site conference on deep plowing and agricultural tool improvement specifically requires that a large-scale mass deep plowing movement be launched throughout the country from now on. According to different conditions, all cultivated land will be deep plowed and deeply cultivated once within one, two, or three years to improve soil fertility. Starting from this autumn planting, it is required that winter wheat, rapeseed, and other overwintering crops be planted on deeply plowed land in all regions. All regions should actively respond to this call.

Deep plowing can greatly increase production, which is the valuable experience gained by Chinese farmers in thousands of years of production practice. Local folk sayings say: "One inch of deep plowing is worth a stubble of fertilizer, two inches of deep plowing turns the land into gold"; "Water is blood, fertilizer is grain, deep plowing builds a granary." These vividly illustrate the significance of deep plowing.

After cooperativization, the experiences of Changge County in Henan, Anguo County in Hebei, and Shouzhang County in Shandong, where the deep plowing movement was launched earlier, have proved that deep plowing has many benefits. Deep plowing combined with layered fertilization can increase the soil aggregate structure. Each soil aggregate is a small reservoir and a small fertilizer reservoir. The increase in soil aggregate structure increases the soil porosity, allowing the soil particles to store large amounts of water and fertilizer. During rain or irrigation, it can absorb and store large amounts of water; during drought, it can reduce water evaporation losses, which is conducive to drought and flood resistance, and fully exerts the effectiveness of water and fertilizer. Deep plowing greatly thickens the soil layer, improves the soil's water, fertilizer, temperature, and ventilation conditions, enhances the activity of microorganisms, and transforms the potential fertility in the soil into substances that can be absorbed by crops through microbial decomposition, turning raw soil into mature soil and mature soil into fertile soil, thus greatly improving soil fertility, equivalent to turning one mu of land into several mu of land. The activity space of crop roots is also greatly expanded due to deep plowing. The loose soil increases the supply of water and fertilizer, which facilitates crop root development, promotes deep rooting, enhances wind resistance, and prevents lodging. For tuber crops, it also facilitates the growth of large numbers of tubers; this provides a basis for dense planting. Deep plowing can cut off the roots of rhizome and rootstalk weeds, turning the weeds into the soil and turning them into fertilizer; it can also turn up insect eggs at the bottom of the land, turn down surface insect eggs, kill pests, and prevent some fungal diseases.

Judging from the current materials from various regions, deep plowing can generally increase crop yields by half to one times, and in some cases, it can reach three, five, or more times. In Changge County, the cornfield of the "May Fourth" cooperative yielded 1,080 jin per mu after deep plowing, and 544 jin per mu without deep plowing. The millet field of Xinlu No. 13 Cooperative yielded 600 jin per mu after deep plowing, and 320 jin per mu without deep plowing. The sweet potato field of Guangming No. 1 Cooperative yielded 9,000 jin per mu after deep plowing, and 3,000 jin per mu without deep plowing. The cotton field of Qianjin No. 18 Cooperative yielded 320 jin of seed cotton per mu after deep plowing, and 30 jin per mu without deep plowing. The sorghum field of Youhao No. 1 Cooperative yielded 480 jin per mu after deep plowing, and 300 jin per mu without deep plowing. The wheat field of Po Hu Township No. 3 Cooperative yielded 450 jin per mu after deep plowing, and 250 jin per mu without deep plowing. The peanut field of Lianfeng No. 6 Cooperative yielded 350 jin per mu after deep plowing, and 150 jin per mu without deep plowing. Last year, the average rice yield per mu in Yunnan Province was 400 jin, but the average yield in the dozen or so counties that carried out deep plowing was 600 jin. This proves that deep plowing is equally effective for paddy fields. This year's high-yield fields of wheat and rice in various regions are also closely related to deep plowing. The early rice field of Jianguo No. 1 Cooperative in Macheng County, Hubei Province, which yielded more than 36,900 jin per mu, had been plowed ten times to a depth of more than one chi. The early rice field of Chunguang Cooperative in Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, which yielded 10,597 jin per mu, had been deeply plowed four times to a depth of more than one chi and seven cun. The wheat field in Xiping County, Henan Province, which yielded 7,320 jin per mu, had been deeply plowed four times to a depth of one chi and eight cun to two chi; the wheat field in Zhuotou Village Cooperative in Anguo County, Hebei Province, which yielded 5,100 jin per mu, had also been deeply plowed to a depth of two chi. These many facts undeniably prove the significant effect of deep plowing on increasing production. It proves that deep plowing is the foundation of various other measures. In areas where water conservancy and fertilizer have been basically solved, deep plowing is the center of various production increase measures and also the direction of future efforts to increase agricultural production. A great transformation of all cultivated land across the country will greatly promote agricultural production and bring about a greater leap forward in crop yields.

To make all cultivated land across the country undergo a great transformation within one, two, or three years is a remarkable and unprecedented feat in history. To accomplish this feat, the leadership in various regions must have sufficient determination, mobilize the entire party, and launch a vigorous mass movement. Specific measures, based on the existing experience of various regions, should include the following: 1. Launch a mass debate on deep plowing to overcome various right-leaning conservative ideas and unify the ideological understanding of the entire party and the entire people. Give full play to enthusiasm and strive for the upstream. The experience of Anguo County is that "plowing the land must first plow the mind." 2. Formulate plans and clarify tasks. Planning should combine top-down and bottom-up approaches, formulating plans at all levels, acting while planning, and constantly supplementing and revising with the development of the situation. Before planning, seize the opportunity to conduct necessary investigations and research to make the plan as practical as possible. The plan should prominently pay attention to labor arrangements and tap the potential of labor in all aspects. Many places in Hebei Province are preparing to call on people in mountainous areas to go down the mountains, city residents to go to the countryside, and students and the People's Liberation Army to work together in a communist large-scale collaboration to concentrate their efforts. This is very good. 3. Vigorously reform agricultural tools to improve work efficiency. In the comprehensive improvement of agricultural tools, the current priority should be given to deep plowing tools. Break the superstitious and conservative idea that only engineering and technical personnel can modify and create agricultural tools, and vigorously mobilize the masses to modify and create their own. At the same time, all mechanical and handicraft departments should be mobilized to closely cooperate with the strength of agricultural cooperatives to manufacture deep plowing tools in large quantities. In the future, the manufacture of agricultural machinery should be designed and trial-produced according to the requirements of deep plowing, and promoted after identification. 4. Pay attention to technology when deep plowing, ensure that the live soil is on top, do not disrupt the soil layers; combine watering and fertilization to fundamentally improve the soil; differentiate different crops, adapt to local conditions and timing, and do not be uniform. There are now many deep plowing methods in various regions, and in the future, attention should be paid to improving and creating them, and constantly improving the quality and efficiency of deep plowing. 5. Provinces, special districts, counties, townships, and cooperatives should all pay attention to summarizing typical examples, making models, holding on-site meetings, and comprehensively promoting them. Create an atmosphere of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced, so that the movement can continue to move forward.

According to the plans put forward by various provinces at the Changge Conference, the task of deep plowing wheat fields in autumn this year in various provinces is very heavy. In many provinces, the task of deep plowing wheat fields in autumn accounts for about six-tenths of the total task. Henan and Shandong provinces each reach 80 million mu, and Hebei Province reaches 61.5 million mu, which is particularly large. This is an important key that is directly related to whether greater harvests can be achieved for summer crops next year. Currently, "Chu Shu" (the end of heat) has passed, and the period for autumn harvest and autumn planting is not far away. It is hoped that all regions will pay close attention, start early, grasp the principle of freeing up one mu and plowing one mu, and strive to plow early and plow more, and complete the plowing in advance.

　　让土地来个大翻身
    中共中央政治局扩大会议，把深耕列为今冬明春农业生产的一系列措施的中心。最近召开的全国深翻地和农具改良的现场会议，具体要求从现在起，在全国范围内，展开一个大规模的群众性的深翻地运动。全国各地根据不同情况，分别在一年、二年、三年内，把所有耕地深翻深耕一遍，提高土壤肥力。从今年秋种开始，要求各地做到冬小麦、油菜及其他越冬作物，都种在深翻地上。各地都应当积极响应这个号召。
    深翻地能够大量增产，是我国农民在几千年生产实践中取得的宝贵经验。各地农谚说：“深耕一寸顶茬粪，深耕二寸地生金”；“水是血，粪是粮，深翻土地建谷仓。”这些生动地说明了深翻地的意义。
    在合作化以后，开展深翻地运动较早的河南长葛县、河北安国县和山东寿张县等地经验证明，深翻地好处很多。深翻地结合分层施肥，可以增加土壤团粒结构。每一个土壤团粒就是一个小水库、小肥料库。土壤团粒结构增加，土壤空隙增多，土粒里面就可以贮存大量的水分、肥分。在下雨或灌溉的时候，能大量吸收和贮存水分；在干旱的时候，能减少水分蒸发的损失，有利于抗旱防涝，充分发挥水、肥效能。深翻地大大加厚了土层，改善土壤的水分、肥分、温度和通气条件，增强微生物的活动，使土壤中潜在的肥力经过微生物的分解成为可以被作物吸收的东西，生土变熟土，熟土变油土，因此大大提高了土壤肥力，等于一亩地变成了几亩地。作物根系活动的地盘也因为深翻地而大大地扩大了，土壤疏松，增加了水分和肥分的供应，便利于作物根系发育，扎下深根，增强抗风能力，防止倒伏。如种薯类，还利于生长大量的薯块；这就为密植提供了基础。深翻地可以切断根蘖类和根茎类杂草的根系，把杂草翻入地里，变成肥料；还可以把地底虫卵翻上，把表层虫卵翻下，杀死害虫，并且防止一部分真菌病害。
    从目前各地材料看，深翻土地一般可以提高农作物产量半倍到一倍，高的可达到三倍、五倍以上。长葛县“五四”一社的玉米地，深翻的亩产一千零八十斤，未深翻的五百四十四斤。新路十三社的谷子地，深翻的亩产六百斤，未深翻的三百二十斤。光明一社的甘薯地，深翻的亩产九千斤，未深翻的三千斤。前进十八社的棉花地，深翻的亩产三百二十斤籽棉，未深翻的三十斤。友好一社的高粱地，深翻的亩产四百八十斤，未深翻的三百斤。坡胡乡三社的小麦地，深翻的亩产四百五十斤，未深翻的二百五十斤。连丰六社的花生地，深翻的亩产三百五十斤，未深翻的一百五十斤。云南省去年全省平均水稻亩产四百斤，但开展了深翻的十几个县平均为六百斤。这证明深翻对于水田一样有效。今年各地的小麦和水稻高额丰产田，也都与深翻有密切的关系。湖北省麻城县建国一社亩产三万六千九百多斤的早稻田，曾经翻地十次，深达一尺以上。湖北省应城县春光社亩产一万零五百九十七斤的早稻田，曾经深翻四遍，深达一尺七寸多。河南省西平县亩产七千三百二十斤的小麦地，曾深翻四遍，深达一尺八寸至二尺；河北省安国县卓头村社亩产五千一百斤的小麦地，也曾经深翻达二尺。这许多事实，无可争辩地证明了深翻土地对增产的重大作用。证明了深耕是其他各种措施的基础，在水利、肥料已经基本解决的地区，深耕是各种增产措施的中心，也是以后农业增产的努力方向。全国所有耕地的大翻身，必将大大地推动农业生产，给农作物产量带来更大的跃进。
    要在一年、二年或三年内使全国所有耕地来个大翻身，是一件了不起的大工程，是历史上从来没有过的壮举。为完成这一壮举，各地领导上必须有足够的决心，全党动员，掀起轰轰烈烈的群众运动。具体的措施，根据各地已有的经验，应当包括以下几项：一、开展一个关于深翻土地的群众性大辩论，克服各种各样的右倾保守思想，统一全党全民的思想认识。鼓足干劲，力争上游。安国县的经验，是“翻地必须先翻心。”二、制订规划，明确任务。规划应当自上而下和自下而上相结合，层层制订，边规划边行动，随着形势的发展不断补充修正。规划前应抓紧时机进行必要的调查研究，使规划尽可能切合实际。规划中要突出地注意劳动力安排，从各方面挖掘劳动的潜力。河北省许多地方准备在深翻运动紧张时号召山区人民下山，市民下乡，学生和解放军一齐动手，搞共产主义大协作，全力突击。是很好的。三、大力改革农具，提高工效。在全面改良农具中，当前要把深翻农具放在首要地位。要打破只有工程技术人员才能改装和创制农具的迷信保守思想，大力发动群众自己起来改装和创制。同时应当动员所有机械部门和手工业部门，密切配合农业社力量大量制造深翻农具。今后制造农业机械，应按照深翻的要求进行设计试制，经鉴定后推广。四、深翻土地要注意技术，保证活土在上，不乱土层；结合浇水施肥，从根本上改良土壤；分别不同作物，因地因时制宜，不能千篇一律。各地现在已有很多的深翻方法，今后还应注意改进，创造，不断提高深翻的质量和效率。五、省、专、县、乡、社都要注意总结典型，作出样子，开现场会，全面推广。造成一种学先进、赶先进的风气，使运动不断地前进。
    根据长葛会议上各省提出的规划，今年各省秋季麦地深翻的任务都很大。不少省份秋季麦地深翻任务占到总任务的十分之六左右。河南、山东两省各达八千万亩，河北省达六千一百五十万亩，为数尤巨。这是直接关系到明年夏收作物能否取得更大丰收的重要关键。目前“处暑”已过，距离秋收秋种为期不远。希望各地密切注意，及早下手，掌握腾一亩翻一亩的原则，力求早翻多翻，提前翻完。
