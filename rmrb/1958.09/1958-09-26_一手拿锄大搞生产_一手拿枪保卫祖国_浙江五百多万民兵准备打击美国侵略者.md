Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, September 24th. The 5.5 million armed militiamen of Zhejiang Province warmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's solemn statement, angrily refute Dulles' absurdities, and unanimously express their determination to defend the great motherland at the cost of blood and sacrifice, ready to strike the American bandits at any time.

In coastal areas such as Zhoushan, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Taizhou, militiamen have held meetings in recent days, repeatedly pointing out that liberating our territories of Jinmen (Quemoy), Mazu (Matsu), and Taiwan is the sacred right of the Chinese people and that no American interference will be tolerated. Dulles' nonsense cannot scare us.

Under the slogan of "Arm ourselves to strike back at U.S. imperialist military provocations," Zhejiang Province's militia ranks are constantly expanding, with 43 counties having achieved universal conscription. People's communes in various regions have established People's Armed Forces Departments, forming divisions, regiments, battalions, and companies under the slogan of "workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers as one" and "one hand holding a hoe, the other holding a gun." A large number of war service organizations, such as rescue and transportation teams, have also been established in coastal areas. Currently, more than 500,000 militiamen in the province have undergone military training, and many have achieved excellent results. They are ready at any time to support the battle to liberate the coastal islands.

    浙江五百多万民兵准备打击美国侵略者
    新华社杭州24日电  浙江省武装起来的五百五十多万民兵热烈拥护陈外长庄严声明，愤怒驳斥杜勒斯谬论，一致表示将不惜流血牺牲，坚决保卫伟大祖国，随时准备痛击美国强盗。
    舟山、宁波、温州、台州等沿海地区的民兵几天来纷纷集会，一再指出：解放我国领土金门、马祖和台湾是我国人民的神圣权利，决不容许美国干涉，杜勒斯的胡说八道，吓不倒我们。
    在“武装起来回击美帝军事挑衅”的口号下，浙江省民兵队伍在不断扩大，已有四十三个县实现了全民皆兵。各地人民公社纷纷成立人民武装部，在“工农商学兵五位一体”、“一手拿锄、一手握枪”的口号下，编成了师、团、营、连组织，沿海地区还建立了大批救护、运输等战勤组织。目前全省五十多万进行了军事训练的民兵，已有许多人获得优秀成绩。他们随时准备支援解放沿海岛屿的战斗。
