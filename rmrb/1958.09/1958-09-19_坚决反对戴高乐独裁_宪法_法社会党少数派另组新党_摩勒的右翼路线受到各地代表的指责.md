    Firmly Oppose De Gaulle's Dictatorial "Constitution"
    French Socialist Party Minority Faction Forms New Party
    Mollet's Right-Wing Line Criticized by Delegates from Various Regions
    (People's Daily News) The French Socialist Party's 50th Congress, lasting four days, concluded on the evening of September 14th. In the final day's session, manipulated by the right-wing leadership group headed by Secretary-General Mollet, the congress passed a resolution supporting De Gaulle's dictatorial "constitutional" draft by a vote of 2,786 to 1,176 (62 abstentions), creating a definite split within the French Socialist Party.
    Throughout the four-day conference, the majority and minority factions engaged in intense struggle over De Gaulle's dictatorial "constitution." On the 13th, this struggle reached its climax. Minority leader Depreux read out a statement firmly opposing De Gaulle's "constitutional" draft, signed by forty individuals including former party Secretary-General Daniel Mayer, former Minister Tanguy-Prigent, former Prime Minister Félix Gouin, former parliamentary group chairman Robert Verdier, and National Assembly members Alain Savary and Antoine Mazier. Representatives from Socialist Party organizations in many provinces, including Finistère, Haute-Vienne, Nord, and Côtes-du-Nord, also criticized the right-wing leadership group for siding with De Gaulle and demanded that the congress oppose the "constitutional" draft.
    The strong opposition to the "constitutional" draft within the Socialist Party, particularly the presentation of the forty-person statement, greatly alarmed Mollet. He and other members of the right-wing leadership group subjected the delegates to a series of intimidations and deceptions, attempting to force the delegates opposing the "constitution" to abandon their position. However, this approach by the right-wing leadership group failed to prevent the split of the Socialist Party. The day after the close of the congress, former minister and Seine Councillor Édouard Depreux announced his departure from the Socialist Party and the formation of an "Independent Socialist Party," whose participants mainly included Robert Verdier, Alain Savary, and Daniel Mayer. They also decided to join the "Union of Democratic Forces" organization, which insisted on opposing De Gaulle's "constitutional" vote.

    坚决反对戴高乐独裁“宪法”
    法社会党少数派另组新党
    摩勒的右翼路线受到各地代表的指责
    本报讯　历时四天的法国社会党第五十次代表大会已于9月14日晚结束。在最后一天的会议上，在以总书记摩勒为首的右翼领导集团的操纵下，大会以二千七百八十六票对一千一百七十六票（六十二票弃权）通过了支持戴高乐独裁“宪法”草案的决定，并选出摩勒为总书记，造成了法国社会党分裂的定局。
    在四天的会议中，多数派和少数派始终围绕着戴高乐的独裁“宪法”进行着激烈的斗争。在13日的会议上，这个斗争发展到最高潮。少数派领袖德普勒宣读了坚决反对戴高乐“宪法”草案的声明，在这个声明上签字的有包括党的前总书记丹尼埃·麦耶、前部长汤居伊—普里让、前总理费利克斯·古安、前议会党团主席罗伯·维迪埃，以及国民议会议员阿兰·沙瓦里、安托万·马齐埃等四十人。菲尼斯台尔省、上维也纳省、诺尔省、北海滨省等许多省的社会党组织的代表也纷纷指责右翼领导集团投靠戴高乐，并要求代表大会反对“宪法”草案。
    社会党党内对“宪法”草案的强烈反对，特别是四十人声明的提出使摩勒大为震惊。他和右翼领导集团的其他成员向大会的代表进行了一系列的恫吓和欺骗，企图使反对“宪法”的代表们放弃他们的立场。但是，右翼领导集团的这种做法并没有能挽救社会党的分裂。在大会闭幕后的次日，前部长、塞纳省议员爱德华·德普勒便宣告脱离社会党，组成一个“独立社会党”，参加的人主要有罗伯·维迪埃、阿兰·沙瓦里、丹尼埃·麦耶等人。他们并决定参加坚持反对戴高乐的“宪法”投票的民主力量联盟组织。
