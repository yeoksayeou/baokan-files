Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 28th: The Benxi Steel Plant had already overfulfilled the state plan for September by 4.2% on the 25th, ahead of schedule.

	The average daily output for these twenty-five days increased by 38% compared to August. The steel produced was 12% higher than the actual output in August and 29% higher than the output in January of this year. From the 25th to the end of September, the plant can still produce steel equivalent to about 20% of the planned output for September.

	The utilization coefficient, which marks the technical level of electric arc furnace steelmaking, increased rapidly in September. The average utilization coefficient of each electric furnace in August was 24.6, but from September 1st to 25th, it jumped to 34.3. This month, the plant set four new records for the utilization coefficient of electric arc furnace steelmaking. The record on September 24th reached 55.7. On the same day, the utilization coefficient of Furnace No. 9 reached 68.9, and Furnace No. 8 produced a heat of steel in just 1.26 minutes, setting a new national record for electric arc furnace steelmaking.

	In order to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee to produce 10.7 million tons of steel annually, the workers of the Benxi Steel Plant voluntarily revised the Great Leap Forward plan at the beginning of September and launched a heatwave of high-yield satellite production, thus continuously breaking quotas and releasing electric furnace high-yield satellites three times in the first half of the month.

	After the People's Daily published the news of the Dalian Steel Plant winning the national electric furnace championship on September 18th, it further inspired the confidence of the workers to strive for the high-yield red flag. Under the fighting goal of "Learn from Dalian, Catch up with Dalian, Surpass Dalian," many workers worked continuously for more than ten hours. The workers fought day and night in this way, making the steel output increase day by day.

	Now the production technology level of Benxi Steel Plant is close to that of Dalian Steel Plant, the national electric furnace champion. The workers are determined to create higher production records in the last few days of September and offer a gift to the National Day.

    本溪钢厂提前完成月计划
    钢的平均日产量比上月提高38％，电炉炼钢利用系数连创四次新纪录
    据新华社本溪28日电  本溪钢厂已提前在25日超额4.2％完成了9月份的国家计划。
    这二十五天的平均日产量比8月份提高38％，炼出的钢比8月份的实际产量高12％；比今年1月份的产量高29％。从25日到9月底的五天中，这个厂还能炼出相当于9月份计划产量20％左右的钢。
    标志着电炉炼钢生产技术水平的利用系数，9月份有了飞速的提高。8月份各个电炉的平均利用系数是二十四点六，9月1日到25日就一跃而上升到三十四点三。这个月中，全厂创造了四次电炉炼钢利用系数的新纪录，其中9月24日的纪录达到五十五点七。同一天，九号炉的利用系数达到六十八点九，八号炉仅用一点二十六分钟就炼出一炉钢，创造了全国电炉炼钢的新纪录。
    本溪钢厂的职工们为了响应党中央提出年产一千零七十万吨钢的号召，在9月初主动修订了跃进计划，掀起放高产卫星的热潮，因而在上半月连续突破定额，先后三次放出了电炉高产卫星。
    人民日报在9月18日刊登了大连钢厂连获全国电炉冠军的消息后，更加激励了职工们争取高产红旗的信心。在“学大连、赶大连、超大连”的奋斗目标下，许多工人连续工作十小时以上。职工们就这样日夜奋战，使钢的产量一天天提高。
    现在本溪钢厂的生产技术水平已经接近全国电炉冠军的大连钢厂。职工们决心在9月分的最后几天中，创造更高的产量纪录，向国庆节献礼。
