Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th. Shanghai steel mills' employees are starting fast and surging ahead, grasping tightly from the beginning of September to complete the arduous steelmaking task, which is more than double that of the previous month.

The atmosphere in front of the steelmaking furnaces is filled with intense combat from the start. The No. 1 converter workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, one of the eight red banners in the city, produced nine more furnaces of steel than the target on September 1st, and another nine more furnaces on September 2nd. The open-hearth furnace workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant encountered unprecedented difficulties at the beginning of this month: the Huangpu River was at high tide, flooding the bottom of the checker brick chamber, causing the furnace temperature to drop. At the same time, the raw materials for steelmaking had complex compositions and high sulfur content. However, even under such difficult conditions, the two open-hearth furnaces still produced eighteen furnaces of steel on the 1st and 2nd.

Currently, employees in various factories are taking various measures to ensure increased production at the beginning of the month. The No. 1 Steel Plant learned from the lesson of being relaxed at the beginning of August and tightening up at the end of the month. At the end of August, it organized cadres and the masses to discuss new tasks. On September 2nd, it held a congress of all factory employees to further propose measures to complete the September plan. This factory did not vigorously engage in technical innovation last month, which hindered increased production. Now it is vigorously mobilizing the masses to engage in technical innovation in a big way. The open-hearth furnace workshop of the No. 3 Steel Plant decided to adopt the method of first removing more impurities from the bad raw materials in the pig iron furnace before sending them for steelmaking to fight against the bad raw materials. Now the employees are preparing to immediately renovate the pig iron furnace.

Striving to put workshops under construction into production as soon as possible and to quickly normalize newly put-into-production workshops is one of the keys for various factories to complete the steelmaking task this month. Relevant leadership departments and factories have been holding meetings for days to study and prepare to concentrate their efforts on completing key construction projects.

### 赶早不赶晚　时间就是钢  上海炼钢工人起步快冲劲猛

　　赶早不赶晚　时间就是钢
    上海炼钢工人起步快冲劲猛
    据新华社上海4日电　上海各炼钢厂职工起步快，冲劲猛，9月份一开始就抓紧完成比上月要多一倍多的繁重炼钢任务。
    炼钢炉前一开始就充满了紧张战斗气氛。全市八面红旗之一的上海第一钢铁厂第一转炉车间，9月1日就比指标多吹炼出了九炉钢，2日又多吹炼出九炉钢。上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间，这个月一开始就碰到过去少有的困难：黄浦江涨潮，浸及炉底格子房，炉温下降，同时炼钢原料成分复杂，含硫高。但是工人们在这样困难的情况下，两座平炉1日、2日两天仍然炼出了十八炉钢。
    目前，各厂职工正在采取各种办法来保证月初就能增产。第一钢铁厂吸取8月份月初松月末紧的教训，在8月底就组织干部和群众讨论新任务，9月2日又召开全厂职工代表大会，进一步提出了完成9月份计划的措施。这个厂上月没有大闹技术革命，曾使增产吃了亏，现在正大力发动群众来大闹特闹技术革命。第三钢铁厂平炉车间确定采取先在化铁炉内多去掉一些坏原料中的杂质，再送去炼钢的办法，来向坏原料作斗争。现在职工们准备马上动手改装化铁炉。
    争取使建设中的车间尽快投入生产、使刚投入生产的新车间迅速正常起来，是各厂完成这个月炼钢任务的关键之一。有关领导部门和工厂连日开会研究，准备集中力量突击完成重点建设工程。
