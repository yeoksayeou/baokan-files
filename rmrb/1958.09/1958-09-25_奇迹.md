    Miracle
    Yesterday, "Beijing No. 1," a real airplane designed and manufactured by the teachers and students of Beijing Aviation Institute, took to the sky; in the near future, similar silver eagles will soar over the motherland's skies one after another. What an inspiring piece of good news!
    According to the average person's thinking, Beijing Aviation Institute is a school, not a factory, so how could it manufacture airplanes? Until a few months ago, many teachers and some students at this school thought the same way. Beijing Aviation Institute did not have specialized aircraft designers and technical workers, nor did it have the equipment and materials to manufacture airplanes. Designing and manufacturing a modern airplane seemed to have "insurmountable difficulties"! But today, "Beijing No. 1" has already flown over the skies of the capital; this is truly a miracle!
    What does this miracle prove? It proves once again that as long as there is the leadership of the Party, any difficulty can be overcome, and anything can be accomplished. As one student aptly put it: "In the past, I thought scientific research couldn't be done without old experts, but now I realize that scientific research can't be done without the Party." People have deeply experienced the Party's great role in practice.
    In the process of designing and manufacturing the airplane, the teachers and students of Beijing Aviation Institute powerfully demonstrated that the Party can not only lead politics but also lead professional work. Of course, by professional work, we don't mean every technical problem, but rather helping people choose a correct path on every specific issue; supporting advanced things and opposing backward phenomena; and using collective strength to overcome difficulties when they arise. This is putting politics in command, liberating thought, and giving full play to the wisdom and talent of the masses – political and ideological leadership. Such leadership can not only achieve great revolutionary victories in class struggle, but also achieve victories in the rapid leaps forward in socialist construction, industry, agriculture, and cultural education. Marxism can not only produce politics but also increase grain and steel production; now, a modern airplane has been manufactured in a school like Beijing Aviation Institute, which lacks both technical strength and equipment and materials, let some bourgeois intellectuals who do not believe that the Party can lead everything sulk in a corner in the face of countless ironclad facts; they are bound to fail in the end!
    Under the leadership of the Party organization, which firmly grasped the direction that education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor, the teachers and students of Beijing Aviation Institute overcame various right-leaning ideas and many erroneous thoughts, completed the design and manufacture of the airplane ahead of schedule, and made "Beijing No. 1" truly take to the sky. Such a miracle cannot be found in the history of education, and it is also a blank page in foreign literature; it can only appear in the new socialist China, in the Mao Zedong era, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Such a miracle encourages us to move from victory to victory, and encourages educational workers across the country to implement the Party's educational policy under the correct leadership of the Party, to build communist institutions of higher learning, and to cultivate new people who are comprehensively developed communists.
    We believe that those who are still watching and hesitating will also broaden their horizons and liberate their minds in the face of this miracle, put down their heavy burdens, and catch up with this great era as soon as possible. The doubters and onlookers at Beijing Aviation Institute are already saying convincingly: "As long as there is the leadership of the Communist Party, there is nothing that cannot be done." In this great era, let us see the tremendous changes in people and the continuous victory of the Party's leadership!

    奇迹学先
    昨天，北京航空学院的师生亲手设计和制造的真的飞机——“北京一号”上了天；不久的将来，同样的银鹰，将一架架地翱翔在祖国的天空。这是一个多么振奋人心的捷报呵！
    按照一般人的想法，北京航空学院是一所学校，并不是工厂，哪里能够制造飞机？在几个月前，就是这个学校的许多教师和一些学生原来也都是这样想的。北京航空学院没有专门的飞机设计人员和技术工人，也没有制造飞机的设备和材料。要设计和制造一架现代化的飞机，似乎有着“难以克服的困难”！但是，今天，“北京一号”已经飞上了首都的天空；这真是一个奇迹！
    这个奇迹证明了什么？它再次证明：只要有党的领导，任何困难都能克服，任何事情都能办到。有一位学生说得好：“过去我以为科学研究没有旧专家不行，现在才知道进行科学研究离开了党不行”，人们已经在实践中深深地体会到党的伟大作用。
    北京航空学院的师生在设计和制造飞机的过程中，有力地说明：党不仅可以领导政治，也可以领导业务。当然，我们所指的业务不是每一个技术问题，而是在每一个具体问题上帮助人们选择一条正确的道路；支持先进的事物，反对落后的现象；遇到困难，运用集体的力量来克服。这就是政治挂帅，解放思想，发挥群众智慧和才能的政治思想领导。这样的领导，不仅可以取得阶级斗争的伟大革命的胜利，而且可以取得社会主义建设的工业、农业和文化教育事业飞速跃进的胜利。马克思主义不仅可以出政治，而且也可以增产粮食和钢铁；现在，在北京航空学院这样一个既缺技术力量又缺设备和材料的学校中又制成了现代化的飞机，让一些不相信党可以领导一切的资产阶级知识分子在无数的铁的事实面前向隅吧，他们是终归要失败的！
    北京航空学院的教师和学生在党组织紧紧抓住教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，教育必须结合生产劳动方针的领导下，克服了各种各样右倾思想和许多错误思想，提前完成设计和制成飞机，使“北京一号”真的上了天。这样的奇迹，在教育史上是找不到的，在外国文献里也是空白的；只有在社会主义的新中国，在毛泽东时代，在中国共产党领导下，才能出现。这样的奇迹，鼓舞着我们从胜利走向胜利，鼓舞着全国教育工作者在党的正确领导下，贯彻执行党的教育方针，办成共产主义的高等院校，培养出共产主义的全面发展的新人。
    我们相信，那些还在观望犹疑的人们，也将在这个奇迹面前扩大眼界和解放思想，放下沉重的包袱，使自己早日跟上这个伟大的时代。北京航空学院的怀疑派、观潮派已经信服地在说：“只要在共产党领导下，没有办不到的事”。让我们在伟大的时代，看到人的巨大变化，看到党的领导的不断胜利！
