Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 31st - More than 800,000侗 (Dòng) people living in Guizhou, Hunan and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are striving for a great leap forward in industry and agriculture with soaring enthusiasm.

The侗 (Dòng) people are concentrated in the border areas of the three provinces (regions). In the past, agricultural production was mostly in a backward state of "slash-and-burn farming, relying on the mountains for food." Even in more advanced areas, people mostly used wooden plows and harrows to cultivate the land. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the production of the侗 (Dòng) people developed rapidly, but the foundation was poor, and the extensive farming situation had not been completely changed. Encouraged by the Party's general line for building socialism, the侗 (Dòng) people launched an unprecedented large-scale water conservancy project this year. After a great effort in the spring, more than 60% of the fields have been freed from the threat of drought. Among them, Tongdao侗 (Dòng) Autonomous County in Hunan, known as "no harvest in two out of three years", built more than 10,000 large and small water conservancy projects this year, enabling 80% of the farmland to be free from drought. After another winter, Tongdao County can achieve water conservancy.

In terms of agricultural production technology, these areas, in response to the shortcomings of extensive cultivation, launched a technological innovation movement centered on early planting, deep ploughing, increased fertilization, close planting, and improved agricultural tools, which has greatly changed the face of agricultural production.

In Xinhua侗 (Dòng) Autonomous County, Hunan, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu reached more than 50,000 jin. In the past, rice was planted in "sparse, large nests" in these areas, but now close planting has been widely promoted. In Sanjiang侗 (Dòng) Autonomous County in Guangxi, where the mountains are high and the water is cold, more than 100,000 mu of double-cropping rice have been planted on a large scale for the first time this year. In order to achieve deep ploughing, improved and new agricultural tools have been widely adopted in various places. According to statistics, this year more than 30% of the land in the侗 (Dòng) area is cultivated with double-wheel double-share plows, mountain plows, and single-share plows without wheels. In Liping County, a remote area of Guizhou Province, more than half of the land is cultivated with new agricultural tools.

At present, good harvest news is constantly coming from the侗 (Dòng) area. More than 80,000 mu of early rice planted in Sanjiang侗 (Dòng) Autonomous County, Guangxi, have been harvested, with an average yield of more than 810 jin per mu, and the highest yield reached 1,200 jin per mu. In Malong Township, Tongdao侗 (Dòng) Autonomous County, Hunan, early rice also yielded 600 to 1,000 jin per mu, which is 40% to one and a half times higher than the county's average yield per mu last year.

While making a great leap forward in agriculture, the侗 (Dòng) people have vigorously developed industry. These places originally had no or almost no industry, but with soaring enthusiasm, people quickly built a large number of small factories and mines with the help of the Han people. According to incomplete statistics from Tianzhu, Sansui, Liping, Jinping, Congjiang, Rongjiang in Guizhou Province and Sanjiang侗 (Dòng) Autonomous County in Guangxi, more than 10,000 small factories have been established. Among them are agricultural tool factories, native fertilizer factories, coal mines, iron smelting plants and machinery factories. Agricultural tool factories in Tianzhu and Sansui counties have recently begun to produce ball bearings in batches, preparing to install ball bearings on most of the more than 170,000 ox carts, horse carts, and handcarts manufactured this year.

### 深耕密植代替了刀耕火种  侗族人民大踏步前进

    深耕密植代替了刀耕火种
    侗族人民大踏步前进
    新华社贵阳31日电　居住在贵州、湖南和广西僮族自治区的八十多万侗族人民，正以冲天干劲力争工农业大跃进。
    侗族人民聚居在三省（区）的边沿地区，过去农业生产大都处于“刀耕火种，赶山吃饭”的落后状态；就是在比较先进的地区，人们也多用木犁木耙耕田。解放后，在共产党的领导下，侗族人民的生产虽然发展很快，但是基础较差，还没有彻底改变耕作粗放的状况。在党的建设社会主义总路线鼓舞下，今年侗族人民开展了规模空前的兴修水利工作。他们大干一春，已使60％以上的田免除了旱灾的威胁。其中被称为“三年两不收”的湖南通道侗族自治县，今年修了一万多处大小水利工程，已使80％农田不受旱灾。再干一冬，通道县就可以实现水利化。
    在农业生产技术方面，这些地区针对耕作粗放的缺点，开展了一个以早种、深耕、多施肥、密植和改良农具为中心的技术革新运动，已经使农业生产的面貌大大改观。
    湖南的新晃侗族自治县，每亩施肥达五万斤以上。这些地区过去种植水稻，都是栽“稀大窝”，现在广泛推行了密植。山高水冷的广西三江侗族自治县，今年还破天荒种植了十万多亩大面积的双季稻。为了实现深耕，各地大量采用了改良农具和新式农具。据统计，今年侗族地区有30％以上的土地，是用双轮双铧犁、山地犁和无轮一铧犁等耕作的。贵州省边远的黎平县，用新式农具耕犁的土地达到一半以上。
    目前，侗族地区不断传出了丰收的喜讯。广西三江侗族自治县种植的十万多亩早稻，已收割八万多亩，平均亩产达到八百一十多斤，最高亩产达一千二百斤。湖南通道侗族自治县马龙乡，早稻每亩也收了六百到一千斤，比去年全县平均亩产量高出40％到一倍半左右。
    在农业大跃进的同时，侗族人民大力兴办了工业。这些地方原来没有或几乎没有工业，但人们以冲天干劲在汉族的帮助下迅速建成了大批小厂矿。据贵州天柱、三穗、黎平、锦屏、从江、榕江和广西三江侗族自治县的不完全统计，已办起一万多个小工厂。其中有农具制造厂、土化肥制造厂、煤矿、炼铁厂和机械厂。天柱、三穗两县的农具制造厂，最近开始成批生产滚珠轴承，准备把今年制造的十七万多部牛、马车和人力车，大都装上滚珠轴承。
