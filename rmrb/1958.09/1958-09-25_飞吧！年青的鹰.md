    Fly! Young Eagles
     By Our Correspondent Fu Jun
    On the morning of September 24, a beautiful silver eagle, greeted by fluttering red flags, soared lightly and vigorously into the sky from Beijing's eastern suburbs airport amidst the cheers of the masses. This is the "Beijing No. 1," a light passenger plane designed and manufactured by more than 1,400 students, teachers, and staff of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, working hard for a hundred days and nights to dedicate it to the Party for National Day. As the teachers and students, with smiles of victory, looked up and waved to congratulate it, they will never forget the hard work of those days and nights.

    From "Talking on Paper" to "Real Swords and Guns"
    This spring, the news that the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics was going to design and manufacture its own aircraft spread among all the staff of the institute.

    "The school is building airplanes, how can that work? The school is not a factory, it doesn't have the strength to engage in production, and if it does, the gains won't make up for the losses..." Some people discussed it. They believed that "schools building airplanes is unheard of in the world, it's too risky, and we're afraid that the quality of teaching won't be guaranteed, so it's better not to 'start'." It was at this time that Premier Zhou Enlai learned of the school's plan to build airplanes. Premier Zhou supported the proposal, and he pointed out that this was a good way to combine work-study programs and education with productive labor. This was a great encouragement to the teachers and students. However, the teachers and students had never made airplanes before, and when they heard that they were going to do it for real, they were not sure. Moreover, there were many difficulties in designing and manufacturing airplanes ourselves due to the lack of equipment and insufficient technical strength. Under these circumstances, should we be promoters or detractors? The school's Party committee organized a mass debate, and most people realized in the debate that the school's own design and manufacture of airplanes would definitely be of great benefit to the combination of teaching and scientific research with practice, as well as the ideological transformation of teachers and students. They resolutely responded to the call of the Party committee and were determined to be promoters.

    Time waits for no one, and that's how the teachers and students "got on the horse." Everything had to start from scratch, truly starting from nothing. The design work was undertaken by graduating seniors and some teachers. At first, some people didn't quite believe that the students could carry out the design. One teacher pushed a task that he couldn't complete in a week to the students, wanting to "make it difficult" for them. But to the teacher's surprise, the students completed it in two days, and the quality was very good. This teacher had to change his view of these young people. There were also teachers who didn't dare to sign the drawings designed by the students.

    In the design process, it can be said that one wave was not settled before another rose. Some people, although they agreed to build airplanes at the school, believed that "the school will never produce high-quality airplanes, it's enough if they can fly into the sky." But most people opposed this view. They said that if we want to do it, we have to do it right, we have to "let the East Wind prevail over the West Wind," and we have to be fast and good. Thus, a debate on revising the aircraft design方案展开了. From more than 60 schemes, everyone found seven more satisfactory schemes, and then debated and compared them to determine to make a light passenger aircraft suitable for China's current situation and the urgent needs of national construction. More than 130 teachers and students completed the design task, which would normally take several months for a specialized design institute to complete, after more than a month of efforts. Through the debate and comparison of the entire aircraft design, the students truly learned the comprehensive theoretical and technical knowledge of aircraft design. They said that the harvest this time was really thousands and thousands of times richer than doing "graduation design" alone.

    "Seizing Every Minute"
    From design to trial production of an aircraft like "Beijing No. 1," it would generally take more than a year in a design institute and an aircraft factory. But on the Party's birthday, "July 1," the school's Party committee put forward the slogan of "exerting full effort, seizing every minute, and ensuring that the aircraft takes to the sky on this year's 'October 1'." The teachers and students became more and more enthusiastic. They built sheds as wooden mold workshops, converted the gymnasium into a final assembly workshop, and even the Guandi Temple became a warehouse. Revolutionary methods for rapid aircraft manufacturing continued to emerge. The process room adopted the advanced three-curve method of drawing mold lines, reducing the production time for each template from five hours to two and a half hours. "Youth," "East Wind," "Leap Forward," and "Red Flag" commando teams were active in various workshops. The mechanical processing tasks were heavy, and there were tens of thousands of various parts, but the school's current milling machines could only complete one-third of the tasks by "October 1." What to do? Just when people were worried, the news that the youth commando team had converted lathes into milling machines came, and then the conversion of planers, drilling machines, etc., into milling machines was also successful, ensuring the completion of the task. Some teachers once thought that the school did not have lead-zinc molds and it would be difficult to manufacture exhaust pipes, but this difficulty was also overcome by these young people by replacing lead-zinc molds with cement molds.

    For three months, there has been no distinction between day and night here. People sent off the afterglow of the setting sun in labor, and saw her rising above the horizon again in labor. Students came to the workshop to "settle down," and some students who originally lived in the same room had not seen each other for one or two months, because everyone stayed by their machines, day and night without leaving. One Party branch secretary said: "The most difficult ideological work here is to mobilize everyone to rest."

    The school's responsible comrades also went to the workshop as ordinary laborers to be apprentices or apprentices. Wu Guang, the first secretary and president of the Party committee, patrolled the various workshops late at night in the rain, patiently learning how to do lathe work. Vice President Ma Wen, who had worked as a fitter during the Long March, also personally served as the leader of the materials group and traveled far and wide.

    In the process of designing and manufacturing airplanes, the relationship between teachers and students has become a "production relationship." They call each other "master" and "apprentice," and are no longer like in the past, "teaching books but not teaching people" and "meeting as if they don't know each other." If some people initially doubted that "building airplanes at the school will affect the quality of teaching" and "building airplanes is only a technical problem and cannot be considered scientific," then the entire process of designing and manufacturing airplanes is enough to answer these wrong statements. A female student named Zhou Yaoshan said: "I participated in design, machinery, processing, and even installation. Now I can not only design but also produce." The students said well: "In the past, writing papers and doing graduation designs was just talking on paper. Even if you got a five, you could only say that you had learned half of it, and it had not been tested by production." "No matter how much knowledge you have, you have to see how your products are made. You say you teach well and learn well, but it won't work if you can't produce products." This is a real experience. The students have now truly learned real skills, both literary and military. Taking those who study工艺as an example, 80% of the fifth-year students have now reached the level of fourth-grade workers, and some have reached the level of fifth-grade workers. Some students have also written books such as "Sheet Metal Workers" and "Assembly Workers" based on their production experience. In the process of aircraft design and manufacture, teachers and students have made more than 3,000 technical innovations and inventions.

    Let More and Better Silver Eagles Be Born
    On September 20, Kong Qingren, deputy director of the final assembly workshop, a first-year freshman who had just come from a速成中学this year, a labor model, led more than 200 teachers and students in carrying out the final process of "Beijing No. 1" - final inspection. "Beijing No. 1" underwent various wind and pressure tests in static and dynamic laboratories. Sometimes it performs front-wheel landings, causing the front of the fuselage to withstand great pressure, and sometimes it performs dives and pulls up when the wings are subjected to the greatest force.... The test proves that it is indeed healthy - the "wings," "legs," whole body "bones," and "skin" are all very good - meeting the design requirements. The laboratory sent a certificate of conformity. "Beijing No. 1" was born like this, and people cheered for the victory of the Party's education policy. They believe that new-style silver eagles will continue to be born from the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics one after another.

    "Beijing No. 1" has opened up a broad航道for teachers and students to be both red and expert, both literary and military. Young eagles, fly bravely along this航道!

    飞吧！年青的鹰
     本报记者  傅军
    9月24日上午，一架漂亮的银鹰，迎着招展的红旗，在群众欢腾声中，轻盈、矫健地从北京东郊机场飞上天空。它就是北京航空学院一千四百多名学生、教师和职工苦战一百昼夜，为了国庆向党献礼自己设计、制造的轻型旅客机——“北京一号”。当师生们带着胜利的笑容，仰首向它招手祝贺的时候，他们永远也不会忘记那些日日夜夜的苦战情景。
    从“纸上谈兵”到“真刀真枪”
    今年春天，北京航空学院要自己设计和制造飞机的消息就在全院人员中传开了。
    “学校造飞机，那怎么行？学校不是工厂，没有力量搞生产，搞起来，也得不偿失……”一些人议论了起来。他们认为，“学校造飞机，世界上没见过，太冒险，怕教学质量没有保证，还是不要‘上马’。”正是这时，学校要造飞机的消息被周恩来总理知道了，周总理支持这个倡议，他还指出这是勤工俭学、教育结合生产劳动的一个很好的途径。这真是对师生们极大的鼓励。但是师生们过去毕竟都没有做过飞机，一听说要真刀真枪地干起来，心里总不摸底。而且设备缺乏、技术力量不足，自己设计、制造飞机困难确实是很多的。在这种状况下是做个促进派，还是做个促退派呢？学校党委组织了一次群众性大辩论，大多数人在辩论中认识到学校自己设计和制造飞机，对教学和科学研究联系实际，以及师生们的思想改造肯定会有很大的好处。他们坚决响应党委的号召，下决心做促进派。
    时间不等人，师生们就是这样“上了马”。一切都要从头做起，真是白手起家。设计工作是由五年级毕业班学生和一部分教师担任的。起初，一些人还不大相信学生们能进行设计。有一位教师把自己一星期也完不成的任务推给了学生，想要“难住”他们。可是出乎这位教师的预料，学生们在两天之内就完成了，而且质量很好，这位教师不得不改变了对这些年青人的看法。也还有这样的教师：他不敢在学生设计的图纸上签字。
    在设计过程中，真可以说是一波未平，一波又起，有的人虽然同意在学校造飞机，但是却认为“学校里总不会搞出质量好的飞机来，能飞上天也就凑合了”。但是大多数人反对这种意见，他们说，要搞就要像样子，就要“东风压倒西风”既要快又要好。于是，关于修改飞机设计方案的辩论就展开了。大家从六十多种方案中找出了七种比较满意的方案，再进行辩论评比，确定要做一种适合我国目前情况和国家建设急需的轻型旅客机。一百三十多位师生经过一个多月的努力，就完成了专门设计院在通常情况下需要几个月才能完成的设计任务。通过对于整个飞机设计的辩论、评比，学生们真正学到了飞机设计的全面理论和技术知识。他们说，这次的收获真是不知比一个人单独搞“毕业设计”要丰富几千几万倍。
    “分秒必争”
    从设计到试制成“北京一号”这样的飞机，在设计院和飞机工厂来说，一般也得要用一年多。但是就在党的生日“七一”那天，学校党委又提出了“鼓足干劲，分秒必争，一定要使飞机在今年‘十一’上天”的口号。师生们干劲越来越大，他们搭起了工棚当木模车间，把体育馆改成总装车间，连关帝庙也成了库房。快速制造飞机的革命办法不断地涌现。工艺室采用先进的三次曲线法划模线样，使每块样板生产时间由五个小时减少到二个半小时。“青年”、“东风”、“跃进”、“红旗”等突击队活跃在各个车间。机械加工任务繁重，各种零件要几万个，但是学校现在的铣床到“十一”只能完成三分之一的任务，怎办呢？正在人们发愁的时候，青年突击队改车床为铣床的消息传来了，接着刨床、钻床等改铣床也都相继获得了成功，使完成任务有了保证。有些教师曾认为学校没有铅锌模，难以制造出来排气管，但是这个困难也被这些青年人用水泥模代替铅锌模的办法克服了。
    三个月来，这里已经不分白昼和夜晚，人们在劳动中送走了落日的余辉，又在劳动中看到她升出地平线。同学们来到车间“安家落户”，有些原来住在一个房间的同学，有的已经一两个月互相没有见过面，因为每个人都守在自己的机器旁，多少个日日夜夜也没有离开。一位党支部书记这样说：“这里最难做的思想工作是动员大家去休息。”
    学校的负责同志也都以一个普通劳动者身份到车间里做师傅或学徒。党委第一书记兼院长武光冒雨深夜巡回在各个车间，耐心地学习做车工的活。在长征时期作过钳工的马文副院长也亲自担任材料组长、远途跋涉在各地。
    在设计和制造飞机的过程中，老师和同学之间的关系变成了“生产关系”，他们以“师傅”和“徒弟”相称，再不像过去那样“教书不教人”“见面好像不认识”了。如果说当初有人还怀疑“学校造飞机会影响教学质量”、“造飞机只是技术问题不能算是搞科学”，那末整个设计、制造飞机的过程就足够回答这些错误的说法了。一个叫
  周耀珊的女学生说：“我从设计、机械、加工、直到安装都参加了，现在我不但会设计也会生产了”。学生们说得好：“过去纸上谈兵的写论文，做毕业设计，即使得了五分，那也只能说是学习到了一半，还未经过生产的考验”、“不管你有多大学问，要看你的产品搞的如何，你说你教的好，学的好，但搞不出产品就不行。”这真是切身的体验。同学们现在确实学到了真本事，既能文又能武。拿学工艺的来说，五年级的学生现在有80％达到了四级工的水平，有的人已达到了五级工的水平。有的学生还根据生产经验，写成了“钣金工”“装配工”等书。在飞机设计和制造过程中，师生们的技术革新和创造发明就有三千多项。
    让更多更好的银鹰诞生
    9月20日，总装车间副主任、今年刚从速成中学来的一年级新生、劳动模范孔庆忍，带了二百多个师生正在进行“北京一号”最后一道工序——总检验，“北京一号”在静、动力实验室里，接受了各种风力、压力的考验。它有时表演前轮着陆使机身前段承受大压力，有时表演俯冲拉起时机翼受力最大的情况……。试验证明它确是健康的——“翅膀”、“腿”、全身“骨胳”和“皮肤”都很好——达到了设计要求，试验室送来了合格证。“北京一号”就是这样诞生了，人们为党的教育方针的胜利而欢呼。他们相信，一架接连一架的新式银鹰将继续从北京航空学院诞生出来。
    “北京一号”给师生们开辟了一条广阔的又红又专、能文能武的航道。年青的鹰，沿着这条航道勇敢地飞翔吧！
