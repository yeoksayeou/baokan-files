　　Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 8th: The People's Liberation Army land, sea, and air forces on the Fujian Front have stated from their respective combat positions that they are fully prepared for combat and are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time to inflict devastating blows on the American aggressors who dare to invade our territory, territorial waters, and airspace.
　　Premier Zhou Enlai's statement and the Supreme State Conference's call to the people of the whole country have made the commanders and fighters of the front-line artillery units extremely excited. A commander of a front-line artillery unit said: We are ready. If the aggressors dare to provoke a war, we will give them fierce, accurate, and relentless blows. Soldiers Cheng Xifu and Wang Guangyin, who recently earned third-class merit in several artillery battles, said that they will liberate Jinmen and Mazu, and they will liberate Taiwan. They are determined to use even greater power to deal with the armed interventionists. They also said: The day after Dulles' statement was issued, the Chiang bandit troops on Jinmen Island shelled the Jiangtou area of Xiamen, killing and wounding 35 residents. Our artillery soldiers must avenge the dead compatriots. Anti-aircraft gunners have been standing guard day and night at their gun positions these days, vigilantly watching the sky. They have all signed a protest against "American troops get out of Taiwan," expressing their determination to strike at the aggressors.
　　The front-line infantry has also made all preparations to defend the territory of the motherland. Xu Songmao, political commissar of a certain regiment, said angrily that the Chinese people must liberate their own territory. If American imperialism dares to extend its claws, let it taste the iron fist of the Chinese people.
　　Pilots and ground crew of a certain unit, who recently shot down and damaged three American-made Chiang planes in the past month, stood beside their planes and expressed their determination to fight to the end to defend the motherland's airspace!
　　The front-line naval commanders and fighters are all on high alert, determined to defend the motherland's territorial waters and strike at the war provocations of the American aggressors. The sailors said that the United States is妄想 (妄想 means delusion but I can't think of a better word here without knowing the exact context) to overwhelm the heroic Chinese people by expanding its aggression. It really doesn't know Mount Tai, and we are determined to fight to defend our great motherland.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th: The war provocations of American imperialism against our people have aroused the unparalleled anger of all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army in the Guangzhou area. They unanimously expressed their firm support for Premier Zhou's statement, immediately mobilized, and were ready at any time to meet and severely strike the American aggressors.
　　The troops stationed in various coastal areas of Guangdong have held various symposiums and oath-taking rallies since the evening of the 6th. Gao Pinyang, a famous combat hero of a certain unit guarding Nan'ao Island, said excitedly: Taiwan is a part of our country's territory. If any imperialist dares to interfere in our internal affairs and prevent us from liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands, we will resolutely sink it into the sea.
　　At the military conference held by the leadership of the Guangdong Military Region, all officers and soldiers unanimously adopted a resolution supporting Premier Zhou's statement and opposing the military provocations and war threats of American imperialism. From the evening of the 6th, a certain air force unit wrote thousands of letters of determination to the leading organs and leaders, expressing their determination to fight to the end to defend the integrity of the motherland's territorial sovereignty and to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 8th: In recent days, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Nanjing area troops have gathered to denounce the aggressive crimes of American imperialism and unanimously expressed their warm support for Premier Zhou's statement, determined to fight to the end to defend the motherland and liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan.
　　Luo Shirong, a third-class people's hero of the "Luoyang Battalion" and "Red First Company" stationed on the coastal defense front, said that we have made all preparations and are ready to join the battle to defend the motherland at any time. If American imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, we will resolutely eliminate it. Hundreds of representatives attending the conference of advanced elements of the artillery units in the Nanjing area unanimously condemned the robber-like behavior of American imperialism in expanding its aggression. Combat hero Zhang Ming said that we have made all preparations. As long as the motherland calls, we will immediately dispatch to counterattack the aggressors.
　　Today, officers and soldiers of the leading organs of the Nanjing troops also gathered to denounce the aggressive crimes of American imperialism, determined to make all combat preparations, and be ready to smash the aggressors' offensives and liberate the territory of the motherland at any time. Li Guohou, commander of a certain unit, said that if American imperialism dares to invade, we will certainly unite with the people of the whole country and wipe it out completely, thoroughly, and cleanly.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 8th: All officers and soldiers of the Inner Mongolia Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army unanimously supported Premier Zhou's statement, resolutely expressed their determination to hold their guns tightly, await orders, and vow to fight to the end to liberate our Taiwan and the coastal islands!
　　Since the morning of the 7th, all officers and soldiers of the various units have gathered and unanimously stated that they will never give up until Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan are liberated. Hao Tela (Mongolian), a national first-class combat hero, said at the meeting: Taiwan is our country's sacred and inviolable territory. American imperialism must never be allowed to run rampant. We must liberate Taiwan. I request to go to the forefront to eliminate American imperialism. Sangga Xili (Mongolian), who made meritorious service on the Korean battlefield, said: I have fought against the American army. The American army is a paper tiger that cannot withstand a single blow. If it continues to expand its aggression and carry out war provocations in the Taiwan Strait area of our country, it will inevitably suffer the same shameful defeat as on the Korean battlefield.
　　Many soldiers of Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups who have completed their terms of service have stated at every gathering that if Taiwan is not liberated, we will not demobilize. We must contribute our strength to the struggle to liberate Taiwan.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th: The land, sea, and air force units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Wuhan area are determined to make all combat preparations, respond to the call of the motherland at any time, and give the aggressors a devastating blow. In the past two days, the various units have gathered and paraded in the streets and alleys together with the broad masses of people, expressing their support for Premier Zhou's statement with practical actions and their determination to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan!
　　All the delegates who are attending the Party Congress of the troops in the Wuhan area unanimously passed a resolution on the 8th, calling on commanders and fighters to mobilize to defend the motherland, stop the war provocations of American imperialism, realize the integrity and unification of the motherland's territory, and be ready to strike at the aggressors at any time.
