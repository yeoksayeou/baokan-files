What is an Atomic Reactor?
	Wang Hong

	China's first atomic reactor has officially started operating, marking China's entry into the atomic energy era.

	What is an atomic reactor? Simply put, it is a device that controls the nuclear fission chain reaction to produce energy.

	The atomic nucleus is mainly composed of two kinds of particles: positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. These two types of particles are collectively called nucleons. All charged bodies have a common property: like charges repel, and unlike charges attract. Since protons are all positively charged, there is a repulsive force between them; at the same time, there is also an attractive force between any substances, which is gravity. Therefore, there are two forces existing within a nucleus; it is a unity of contradictions.

	The reason why two particles can form an atomic nucleus is mainly due to the attractive force of nuclear force that holds them together. In light nuclei, because there are fewer protons, the electrostatic repulsion is relatively small; however, in heavy nuclei, there are more protons, and the electrostatic repulsion is very large. If we can divide a heavy nucleus into two parts, then during the fission process, the electrostatic repulsion will push the two parts apart, generating great speed and obtaining great energy, which is atomic energy. If we combine two light nuclei into a heavier nucleus, when they are very close, the nuclear force will attract them to each other, increasing their speeds and also obtaining great energy, which is also atomic energy. Therefore, splitting heavy nuclei or merging light nuclei can both obtain atomic energy.

	Of course, the energy produced by only a few nuclei fissioning or only a few nuclei merging is not significant. If many, many nuclei fission or merge at the same time, the energy produced will be very, very large. A very few types of heavy nuclei are extremely unstable due to the large electrostatic repulsion within them. If we introduce a neutron into their nuclei, the neutron will be affected by its nuclear force and generate a very high speed, causing a large amount of energy and causing the interior of the nucleus to vibrate. At this time, the electrostatic repulsion within the nucleus gets a chance to split the nucleus into two parts, releasing atomic energy. At the same time, during the fission process, it can also release several other neutrons, which can then be injected into other nuclei to cause them to undergo the same fission. These nuclei, after fissioning, release an even greater number of neutrons, which then inject into more nuclei, producing more fission. In this way, one becomes two, two becomes four, and the fission reaction increases without end; this is called a chain reaction. The continuous occurrence of chain reactions can produce unimaginable amounts of energy.

	A metallic atomic nucleus called Uranium-235 has the property of producing a chain reaction. It is used in atomic reactors to generate atomic energy.

	However, Uranium-235 is difficult to extract. What is used in atomic reactors is only pure uranium, and only 0.7% of pure uranium is Uranium-235, while the remaining 99.3% is almost all Uranium-238. The neutrons released during the fission of Uranium-235 are easily absorbed by Uranium-238. After Uranium-238 absorbs neutrons, it does not fission, but slowly turns into other elements, and thus the fission reaction will stop. If we want fission to continue to occur and the chain reaction not to stop, we must find a way to prevent Uranium-238 from absorbing too many neutrons. The only way is to reduce the speed of the neutrons released during the fission of Uranium-235, turning them into low-energy thermal neutrons. Thermal neutrons are particularly easily absorbed by Uranium-235 and cause fission, but they are not easily absorbed by Uranium-238.

	The way to reduce the speed of neutrons is to let them collide with light nuclei. Among the light nuclei, graphite and heavy water are commonly used because they can slow down neutrons and do not absorb neutrons themselves. Graphite and heavy water are also called neutron moderators.

	The reason why China's atomic reactor is called a heavy water type is that the moderator used inside it is heavy water.

    原子反应堆是怎么回事？
    王虹
    我国的第一座原子反应堆已经正式运转了，它标志着我国已经开始跨进了原子能的时代。
    原子反应堆是什么呢？简单地说来，就是控制原子核裂变链锁反应而产能量的一种装置。
    原子核主要是由两种粒子所组成的，一种是带阳电的质子，另一种是不带电的中子，这两种粒子的总名又都叫核子。凡是带电体都有一个共同的性质，那就是同性相斥、异性相吸。既然质子都带阳电，因此相互之间就有一种排斥力；同时，任何物质之间又都有一股吸引力，那就是万有引力，因此核子之间又存在着互相吸引的力。质子互相排斥的力叫做静电力；核子互相吸引的力叫做核力，在一个原子核中本身就具备这两种力，它是一个矛盾的统一体。
    两种粒子所以能组成原子核，主要是靠核力的作用把它们吸引在一起。在轻的原子核里面，因为质子少，静电的排斥力比较小；但是在重的原子核里面，质子多，静电的排斥力就很大。假如我们能够把一个重的原子核分成两部分，那么在分裂时，静电的排斥力就会把两部推开，产生很大的速度，同时得到很大的能量，这个能量就是原子能。假如我们把二个轻的原子核合并成为一个较重的原子核，当它们靠得很近的时候，核力就会把它们互相吸引起来，使两边的速度增加，也能得到很大的能量，这个能量也是原子能。所以，使重原子核分裂，或者使轻原子核合并，都可以得到原子能。
    当然，只有少数几个原子核分裂，或者只有少数几个原子核合并，所产生的能量是不大的。假如在同一个时间，有很多很多个原子核分裂或者合并，那产生的能量就会很大很大。有极少数几种重原子核，由于它们内部的静电排斥力很大，表现得极不稳定，如果设法另外打进一个中子到它们的核里去，这个中子就会受到它的核力而产生很高的速度，发生很大的能量，使这个原子核内部振动起来。这时，核内的静电排斥力就得到了机会，把原子核分裂成两个部分而放出了原子能。同时它在裂变的过程中间，还能够另外放出几个中子，这几个中子又可以射入另外的原子核中去，使它们产生同样的裂变。这些原子核裂变后又放出数量更多的中子，这些中子再射入更多的原子核里去，产生更多的裂变。这样，一变二，二变四，有增无已的裂变反应，就叫做链锁反应。链锁反应的不断发生，就能产生大得难以想象的能量来。
    有一种名叫铀235的金属原子核，就有产生链锁反应的性质。在原子反应堆中，就是用它来产生原子能的。
    但是，铀235是很难提取的，在原子反应堆中用的只是纯铀，而纯铀中只有0.7％的铀235，其余99.3％几乎都是铀238。铀235裂变时放出的中子，很容易被铀238吸收，而铀238吸收了中子之后，它是不分裂的，只会慢慢地变成别的元素，这样，裂变的反应就会中止。若要使裂变不断发生，链锁反应不会中止，就得想办法不让铀238吸收过多的中子。唯一的办法就是把铀235裂变时放出的中子的速度减低，变成能量小的热中子。热中子特别容易被铀235吸收而发生裂变，却不容易被铀238吸收。
    使中子的速度减低的办法，就是让它和轻的原子核相碰撞。在轻的原子核中，能使中子减速，而它本身又不吸收中子的，常用的是石墨和重水。石墨和重水又都叫作中子减速剂。
    我国的这座原子反应堆所以叫做重水型的，就是在它里面用的减速剂是重水。
