    Always Ready to Respond to the Call of the Motherland
    Political Commissar of the Capital Militia Division, Qi Yanming
    After the speech by Dulles, the spokesman for the American bandit group, at the United Nations General Assembly on September 18th reached the Capital Militia Division, all commanders and fighters were filled with boundless anger.
    It is well known that Dulles has consistently used the tricks of rascals and blackmail. This time, he is once again slanderously accusing the Chinese people of "military conquest" and "aggression" for the military actions taken to liberate their own territory, turning black and white. This is truly the raving of a political rogue, raised by American financial oligarchs, strangled by the noose around his own neck. The robbers should know: rascality and blackmail cannot cover up the facts stained with the blood of the people of Xiamen. Taiwan and the coastal islands are the territory of the People's Republic of China. The punitive military actions taken by our people against the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched in Jinmen and Mazu are our country's sovereignty, and the United States has no right to interfere. The Chinese people must recover Jinmen and Mazu, and must liberate Taiwan and Penghu, to safeguard the integrity of the country's territory and sovereignty. If the American robbers dare to launch a war of aggression and interfere in the internal affairs of our country's actions to liberate its own territory, the Chinese people vow to fight to the end, at any cost, to resist aggression.
    The hardworking and brave Chinese people are no strangers to war. For more than 30 years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have gone through a long period of bloody struggle to end the century-long history of oppression and enslavement and achieve a great victory of liberation. Now, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, they are advancing towards nature with an unprecedented heroic posture, striving for the great construction of socialism and the bright future of happy and beautiful communism. The Chinese people know how to treat their enemies, how to defend the socialist construction of their motherland, and how to defend world peace. The incomparably strong will arising from the great ideal is unstoppable by any force.
    Now, the comrades of the Capital Militia Division, organized by the staff of the capital's organizations, are all full of fighting spirit and have proposed to work hard for fifteen days to achieve "Six Goods" – good completion of training, good care of weapons, good unity and mutual assistance, good observance of discipline, good sanitation work, and good cultural and artistic activities, and to strive to complete the training tasks ahead of schedule. We resolutely support the statement of Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi and are always ready to respond to the call of the motherland. If the American aggressors dare to impose war on the Chinese people, our Capital Militia Division will definitely rush to the front lines to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland. We fully believe that the result of the war will be the complete destruction of the American paper tiger, turning it into ashes.

    时刻准备响应祖国的召唤
    首都机关民兵师政治委员　齐燕铭
    美国强盗集团的代言人杜勒斯9月18日在联合国大会上的发言传到首都机关民兵师以后，全体指战员心中充满了无比的愤怒。
    杜勒斯一贯使用撒赖、讹诈的伎俩，已经是世所共知的了。这一次又在颠倒黑白地诬蔑中国人民为解放自己的领土所采取的军事行动，是什么“武力征服”和“侵略”。这真是美国金融寡头所豢养的政治流氓，被自己套在脖子上的绞索勒得发昏了的呓语。强盗们要知道：撒赖和讹诈是掩饰不了厦门人民鲜血所染成的事实。台湾以及沿海岛屿是中华人民共和国的领土。我国人民对盘踞在金门、马祖的蒋介石部队所采取的惩罚性的军事行动，是我国的主权，美国无权过问。中国人民一定要收复金门、马祖，一定要解放台湾、澎湖，以维护国家的领土和主权的完整，如果美国强盗胆敢发动侵略战争，干涉属于我国内政问题的解放自己领土的行动，中国人民誓将不惜任何牺牲，为反抗侵略而战斗到底。
    勤劳勇敢的中国人民不是没有经过战争的。三十多年来，中国人民在中国共产党领导下，经过长期的流血斗争，才结束了百年来被压迫被奴役的历史，取得了伟大的解放胜利。现在正在党的社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，以史无前例的豪迈的姿态，向自然进军，为着社会主义的伟大建设和美好幸福的共产主义的光明前景而迈进。中国人民知道如何对待自己的敌人，也知道如何保卫祖国社会主义的建设以及如何保卫世界的和平。从伟大的理想从而产生的无比坚强的意志，是任何力量不能阻拦的。
    现在首都机关工作人员所组织的民兵师同志们，个个斗志昂扬，提出了苦战十五天，做到“六好”——完成训练好，爱护武器好，团结互助好，遵守纪律好，卫生工作好，文艺活动好，为提前完成训练任务而奋斗。我们坚决拥护陈毅副总理兼外交部长的声明并且时刻准备着响应祖国的召唤。如果美国侵略者胆敢把战争强加到中国人民的头上，我们首都机关民兵师，一定为保卫祖国主权和领土的完整而奔赴前线。我们完全相信，战争的结果，美国这只纸老虎必将彻底毁灭，化为灰烬。
