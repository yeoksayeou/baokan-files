Editorial: The establishment of the China-Iraq Friendship Association is a manifestation of the profound friendship of the Chinese people for the Iraqi people, and has opened up new prospects for further development of friendly relations between the two peoples. The rapid development of friendly relations between China and Iraq shows that the great friendship between our two countries, based on the common aspirations of opposing imperialist aggression, seeking peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation, has vigorous vitality and is solid and unbreakable. We sincerely congratulate the establishment of the China-Iraq Friendship Association and wish the friendly relations between China and Iraq a thriving development!

The great victory of the Iraqi people in overthrowing the rule of imperialism and its agents has added a glorious chapter to the Asian-African peoples' movement for national independence. The Iraqi people, like the peoples of Asian and African countries, have suffered from imperialist plunder and oppression for a long time. In particular, in recent years, imperialism has forcibly imposed the "Baghdad Pact" and the "Eisenhower Doctrine" on the Iraqi people, trying to turn Iraq into a reactionary center for their aggression against the entire Western Asia, and placing the Iraqi people in a completely powerless position. However, the great Iraqi people, with a high degree of patriotism, were not intimidated by the aggressive flames of imperialism. They quickly and overwhelmingly swept away the imperialist ruling forces and established a new republic. The victory of the Iraqi people shows that the seemingly powerful imperialist forces are actually weak in the face of the people with great national awakening; only the nation that unites and fights heroically for independence and freedom is forever invincible. Now, the Iraqi people are advancing along the road of independence and freedom with heroic steps. As Prime Minister Qasim recently stated, the Iraqi people are, on the one hand, "devoting themselves to uniting all the indivisible factors of the Iraqi Republic" to form a powerful force to prevent foreign forces from infiltrating and undermining Iraq's unity; on the other hand, they are preparing to "launch a large-scale revolution for economic development" to control and develop Iraq's rich resources and build their own independent national economy. The victory of the Iraqi people and the great achievements made after the victory have greatly encouraged the people of Arab countries and set a new glorious example for the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries in their struggle for national independence.

The path taken by the Iraqi people is the path that the Chinese people once took. Our two peoples have common demands to oppose imperialist aggression, defend independence, and strive for peace, and we all have an urgent desire to vigorously build our respective countries. Therefore, it is only natural that our two peoples can quickly understand each other, our hearts are linked, and our friendship can be rapidly consolidated and developed. Our people have always had deep brotherly sympathy for the heroic struggle of the Iraqi people. We feel that the struggle of the Iraqi people is our struggle, and the victory of the Iraqi people is our victory. Therefore, on the third day after the victory of the Iraqi people, that is, when US-British imperialism invaded Lebanon and Jordan, seriously threatening the national independence movement of the Middle East Arab nations and the security of the Iraqi Republic, our government, together with other peace-loving countries, announced its recognition of the Iraqi Republic. Our people also launched a large-scale demonstration movement across the country, protesting the aggression of US-British imperialism and demanding that they immediately withdraw their invading troops from the Middle East. We firmly supported the just struggle of the Arab people and the Iraqi people. After the establishment of the Iraqi Republic, it immediately announced its adherence to the Bandung Principles, expressing its desire to coexist peacefully with all countries, and quickly announced its recognition of our country. Subsequently, the Iraqi government decided to establish diplomatic, commercial, and cultural relations with our country, laying a solid foundation for the rapid development of friendly relations between China and Iraq. The consolidation and development of friendly relations between China and Iraq not only fully conforms to the common aspirations and interests of the two peoples, but also benefits the cause of world peace and international cooperation.

Now, although imperialism has suffered a series of failures in the Asian and African regions, it has not abandoned its ambition to invade Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In particular, US imperialism is trying to make a desperate struggle, using various military, political, and economic conspiracies to enslave the people of various countries. Further strengthening unity and supporting each other among the people of Asian and African countries is an important guarantee for defeating imperialist aggression. In the Middle East, the US-British aggressors, in violation of UN resolutions, have been slow to withdraw their invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and still threaten peace in the Middle East. US imperialism also wants to continue to enslave the people of Arab countries through economic shackles. Therefore, the struggle of the people of Middle Eastern Arab countries to defend national independence is far from over. In this struggle, the Chinese people will always stand on the side of the people of Arab countries and will always be the most loyal and reliable friends of the Arab people. The Chinese people are even more pleased to see that in our people's fierce struggle against the US occupation of our territory Taiwan and the expansion of aggression against our coastal islands, the people of Arab countries stand with us. The US imperialist military threat and war provocations in the Taiwan Strait, like its actions in the Middle East, are naked acts of aggression. The Chinese people are determined and have the strength to liberate their own territory Taiwan, especially to liberate the coastal islands of Jinmen and Mazu, which seriously threaten our country's security. The support of the Iraqi people and the people of Arab countries will further inspire our determination to fight against the US imperialists.

Our people attach great importance to the continuous development of friendly relations with the people of Arab countries. We have already established good friendly relations with the United Arab Republic and the Kingdom of Yemen. Our people have friendly exchanges with the people of many other Arab countries and resolutely sympathize with and support their struggle for national independence. Recently, there have been major developments in the friendly relations between our country and many Arab countries. After the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, our government immediately announced its recognition and our leaders sent a telegram to express warm congratulations. After friendly talks, the trade delegations of the governments of China and Tunisia recently signed the first Sino-Tunisian trade agreement. Currently, there are many friends from Arab countries visiting our country, such as the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China and the Iraqi Cultural Delegation. They have all been warmly received by our people. We are honored to have so many friends from Arab countries!

We once again cheer the establishment of the China-Iraq Friendship Association! We firmly believe that the friendship between the Chinese people and the Iraqi people will continue to grow, the friendship with the people of Arab countries will continue to grow, and the friendship with the people of other Asian, African, and Latin American countries will continue to grow!

    中伊两国人民心连心
    中国伊拉克友好协会的成立，是中国人民对伊拉克人民深厚友谊的表现，并为进一步发展两国人民间的友好关系开拓了新的前景。中伊两国友好关系的迅速发展，说明了我们两国建立在反对帝国主义侵略、要求和平共处和友好合作的共同愿望的基础上的伟大友谊，具有充沛的生命力，是巩固的和牢不可破的。我们衷心地祝贺中伊友好协会的成立，祝贺中伊两国的友好关系日新月异地发展！
    伊拉克人民推翻帝国主义及其代理人统治的伟大胜利，在亚非人民争取民族独立运动中放出了异彩。伊拉克人民同亚非各国人民一样，在很长的时期里，遭受着帝国主义的掠夺和压迫。特别是近年来，帝国主义把“巴格达条约”和“艾森豪威尔主义”硬加在伊拉克人民的头上，要把伊拉克变成它们侵略整个西部亚洲的反动中心，使伊拉克人民完全处于无权的地位。但是，有着高度爱国热情的伟大的伊拉克人民，没有被帝国主义的侵略凶焰吓倒，他们迅速地摧枯拉朽地把帝国主义的统治势力一扫而光，建立起一个崭新的共和国。伊拉克人民的胜利说明，貌似强大的帝国主义势力，在有着巨大民族觉醒的人民面前，其实是虚弱的；只有团结起来为独立自由而英勇奋斗的民族，才是永远不可战胜的。现在，伊拉克人民正以豪迈的步伐，沿着独立自由的道路前进。正如卡塞姆总理在最近所表示的，伊拉克人民一方面“正致力于团结伊拉克共和国不可分割的一切因素”，以形成一种强大的力量，使外国势力不能钻进来破坏伊拉克的团结；一方面正准备“发动一个大规模的发展经济的革命”，以控制和开发伊拉克的丰富资源，建设自己独立的民族经济。伊拉克人民的胜利和在胜利以后所取得的重大成就，给阿拉伯国家人民，给亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民带来了极大的鼓舞，并且给这些地区人民争取民族独立的斗争树立了一个新的光荣榜样。
    伊拉克人民所走的道路，也就是中国人民曾经走过的道路。我们两国人民都有反对帝国主义侵略，保卫独立，争取和平的共同要求，都有大力建设我们各自的国家的迫切愿望。因而，我们两国人民能够很快地互相了解，我们的心连着心，我们之间的友谊，得以飞快的巩固和发展，这是很自然的事。我国人民对伊拉克人民的英勇斗争，一向抱着深切的兄弟般的同情。我们觉得伊拉克人民的斗争，就是我们的斗争；而伊拉克人民的胜利，也就是我们的胜利。因此，在伊拉克人民胜利后的第三天，也就是美英帝国主义侵入黎巴嫩和约旦，严重地威胁中东阿拉伯民族独立运动和伊拉克共和国安全的时候，我国政府同其他爱好和平国家一道，宣布承认伊拉克共和国。我国人民并且在全国掀起了一个规模巨大的示威运动，抗议美英帝国主义的侵略，要求它们立即从中东地区撤退侵略军，我们坚决支持着阿拉伯人民和伊拉克人民的正义斗争。伊拉克共和国成立后，立即宣布奉行万隆原则，表示同一切国家友好相处，并很快的宣布承认我国。接着，伊拉克政府又决定同我国建立外交、商务和文化关系，使中伊两国的友好关系得以迅速地奠定巩固的基础。中伊两国友好关系的巩固和发展，不但完全符合两国人民的共同愿望和利益，并且有利于世界的和平和国际合作的事业。
    现在，帝国主义在亚非地区虽然遭到一连串的失败，但是它们并没有放弃侵略亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的野心。特别是美帝国主义力图作绝望的挣扎，正使用军事的、政治的和经济的各种阴谋手段，来奴役各国人民。亚非各国人民进一步加强团结，互相支持，是战胜帝国主义侵略的重要保证。在中东地区，美英侵略者违背联合国的决议，迟迟不肯从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退侵略军，仍然威胁着中东的和平。美帝国主义还想用经济的束缚，继续奴役阿拉伯各国人民。因此，中东阿拉伯各国人民保卫民族独立的斗争，还远没有结束。在这个斗争中，中国人民将永远站在阿拉伯各国人民一边，永远是阿拉伯人民最忠实可靠的朋友。中国人民更欣喜地看到，在我国人民反对美国侵占我国领土台湾和扩大侵略我国沿海岛屿的激烈斗争中，阿拉伯国家人民是同我们站在一起的。美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区的军事威胁和战争挑衅，同它在中东地区所作所为一样，是赤裸裸的侵略行为。中国人民有决心，也有力量，一定要解放自己的领土台湾，特别是一定要解放目前严重威胁着我国安全的金门、马祖等沿海岛屿。伊拉克人民和阿拉伯各国人民对我们的支持，更将鼓舞起我们跟美帝国主义者斗争的决心。
    我国人民十分重视同阿拉伯各国人民之间的友好关系的不断发展。我国同阿拉伯联合共和国、同也门王国已经建立了良好的友好关系。我国人民同其它许多阿拉伯国家人民都有着友好交往，都坚决地同情和支持它们争取民族独立的斗争。最近，我国同许多阿拉伯国家之间的友好关系，又有了重大的发展。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府成立后，我国政府立即宣布给予承认，我国领导人并致电表示热烈祝贺。我国同突尼斯两国政府贸易代表团，经过友好的会谈，最近签订了第一个中突贸易协定。现在正在我国进行友好访问的，有伊拉克人民友好访华团、伊拉克文化代表团等许多阿拉伯国家的朋友，他们都受到我国人民的热情接待。我们以有这许多阿拉伯国家的朋友而感到荣幸！
    我们再一次欢呼中国伊拉克友好协会的成立！我们深信：中国人民同伊拉克人民之间的友谊将不断增长，同阿拉伯各国人民之间的友谊将不断增长，同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲其他各国人民之间的友谊将不断增长！
