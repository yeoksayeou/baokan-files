Sheep Pens Go Uphill, Remote Fields Increase Production
The Gou Lüliang Vanguard Cooperative in Baijia Township, Xing County, Shanxi Province, has hillside land accounting for more than 95% of its total cultivated land. All nine villages in the cooperative require climbing mountains just to leave their homes. In the past, the most troublesome thing for cooperative members in their labor was transporting manure. The rhyme they made up was: "Not afraid of hoes and plows, not afraid of plowing, only afraid of sheep manure缠住身(trapping the body), as long as you get through the manure transportation hurdle, the suffering heart will be happy." Therefore, the herders dared not add too much soil to the pen, fearing that they would not be able to transport it if they added too much. Before 1955, the average application of fertilizer to the land was only sixteen loads per mu.

After agricultural cooperativization in 1956, with the large-scale development of livestock, there was also more fertilizer. What to do? Jia Baozhi, the cooperative director, proposed the idea of "sheep pens going uphill" and fully mobilized both inside and outside the Party, clearing the minds of the cooperative members and sheep workers, allowing 1,280 sheep to go uphill one after another.

In the three years since the sheep pens went uphill, the land yield has changed greatly. In 1956, the average land yield increased from 64 jin to 97 jin, an increase of 51% compared to 1955. Especially this year, after a large number of sheep pens went uphill, the fertilizer application per mu increased to 110 loads, and the yield per mu will reach about 500 jin.

    羊圈上山  远田增产
    山西兴县白家乡沟吕梁先锋社，山坡地占总耕地面积的95％以上，全社九个村出门就得爬山。以往，社员们在劳动中，最苦恼的是送粪。他们编的顺口溜是：“不怕锄耧不怕耕，单怕羊粪缠住身，只要渡过送粪关，解去苦恼心喜欢。”因此，牧工们垫圈不敢多垫土，怕垫的多了送不出去。1955年以前，土地平均亩施肥仅达十六担。
    1956年农业合作化以后，随着牲畜大量发展，肥料也多起来。怎么办呢？社主任贾保执提出了“羊圈上山”的意见，并在党内外进行了充分发动，打通了社员和羊工的思想，让一千二百八十只羊先后上了山。
    羊圈上山三年来，土地产量起了很大变化，1956年土地平均产量就由六十四斤提高到九十七斤，比1955年增加51％。特别是今年羊圈大量上山后，亩施肥料增加到一百一十担，亩产量将达到五百斤左右。
