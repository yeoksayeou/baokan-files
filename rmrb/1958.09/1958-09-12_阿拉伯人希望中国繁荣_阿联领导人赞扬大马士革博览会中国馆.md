Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 10th. Arab United Republic Vice Presidents Hurani and Asali, as well as Syrian Region Economic Minister Kalas, visited the Chinese exhibition hall at the Damascus International Fair today. They were accompanied by Shi Gu, Chinese Consul General in Damascus, and Zhang Huazeng, head of the Chinese exhibition delegation.

Hurani and Asali were very interested in Chinese machinery. Asali specifically asked if these machines were products of China's first Five-Year Plan. When this was confirmed, he expressed his great pleasure and satisfaction. Hurani wrote in the guestbook, "Here we see all the evidence of progress and prosperity in all aspects of life. What makes us even happier is to see that People's China is a great Eastern country with a long history of civilization, supporting the Arab people's struggle to achieve their freedom and unity. Therefore, we hope that People's China will achieve rapid progress and prosperity in all aspects, and liberate the part of Chinese territory that is still occupied by imperialists."

Hurani and Asali also visited the Soviet exhibition hall. They were particularly interested in Soviet agricultural machinery and drilling machines. Hurani said, "We believe that the Soviet Union's economic and scientific achievements, as well as its remarkable technological progress, are not only beneficial to the Soviet people who are friendly to us, but also beneficial to the cause of freedom and consolidating universal peace."

Since the opening of the International Fair, the Chinese exhibition hall has been crowded with people every day. People from neighboring Arab countries, the Egyptian region, and remote villages and cities in the Syrian region, are particularly interested in the Chinese exhibition hall. Many people bought Chinese products as souvenirs in the retail department. Many Arab business people also discussed the possibility of purchasing Chinese machinery, silk, cotton textiles, tea, etc. with Chinese business representatives.
