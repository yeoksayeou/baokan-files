　　Little Rock and London Linked
　　Authorities in Many Southern U.S. States Forbid Black and White Students from Attending the Same Schools
　　Wave of Persecution Against Black People in Britain Supported by Politicians

　　Our newspaper provides comprehensive coverage. Xinhua News Agency reports: On the evening of September 2nd, racialists in Britain carried out provocative attacks again in the Notting Hill area of London, where black people live. About one hundred thugs shouted "Kill the blacks!" in the streets. They also threw bottles filled with fuel at black people's homes from cars.

　　This attack is the third group attack carried out by racialists in Britain in this area in recent days. This rampant movement against black immigrants from the West Indies and other British colonies has aroused opposition from British public opinion. Public opinion believes that this is not an accidental rogue provocation, but a deliberately provoked racial dispute. Many British newspapers pointed out in their September 3rd news that the rogue racialists are connected with the re-emerging fascists. Reuters also said that "the bloody conflicts of the past three days are the result of fascist influence."

　　The "Daily Mail" reported on the 4th that an anti-black organization was discovered in Britain.

　　The newspaper said that the organization maintains close contact with segregationists in South Africa and "haters of black people" in Little Rock and Mississippi in the extreme south of the United States.

　　Supporters of this organization have been found in Birmingham, London, Coventry, and Clacton in Surrey, Britain.

　　Another article published in the "Daily Mail" pointed out, "The dangerous new factor is that they are being encouraged, and perhaps even instructed, by certain political figures. These political figures are activists in the 'Union Movement' (Editor's note: This is the post-war name of the British Fascist Union)."

　　The persecution of black people in London in recent days has aroused strong protests at home and abroad.

　　Many people here abhor this violence against people of color. A protest signed by more than twenty well-known stage and television actors said that this is "violence instead of reason."

　　At the same time, this anti-black action in Britain has caused shock and unease in countries with people of color.

　　The British newspapers' exposure of the close relationship between British and American racialists is not without basis. According to news from New York, the racialists in the United States have also been extremely rampant recently. At the beginning of the new school year, the legislative and administrative authorities of many southern states in the United States hurriedly adopted many discriminatory measures, not allowing black and white people to attend the same schools.

　　Arkansas Governor Faubus, with the support of the state legislature, intends to close schools in Little Rock that have both white and black children attending on the first day of school.

　　The laws of seven southern states in the United States stipulate that these schools can be closed once black children appear in the schools.

　　In Virginia, the Arlington local school board, with the consent of the state authorities, recently passed a decision refusing to accept thirty black students into white schools.

　　In Van Buren, Arkansas, six black students said on the 3rd that they had to drop out of local schools because they were often threatened and insulted by racialists in the schools. Black students everywhere encountered signs saying "Go home" and were attacked with stones. And the police did not care.

　　Racialists are clamoring that integrated schools "will cause chaos and violent actions."

　　The U.S. Supreme Court originally planned to deal with the principle of integrated schools in Little Rock this year, but has not made any decision so far, and has postponed the date for dealing with the issue to September 11. American newspapers believe that the Supreme Court did this because the U.S. President made a statement on the eve of the court meeting that the integration process should be slowed down.

　　While preventing black and white students from attending the same schools, many areas in the United States are inciting racial hatred and attacking black residents. According to reports, effigies of black people hanging from poles have appeared in some cities in the southern states. A racialist named Kasper, known for his brutality, is organizing so-called "volunteer armies" to persecute those blacks who do not submit.

### 小石城伦敦一线牵  美国南部许多州当局不准黑白同校　英国迫害黑人的狂潮受到政客支持

　　小石城伦敦一线牵
　　美国南部许多州当局不准黑白同校
　　英国迫害黑人的狂潮受到政客支持
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：英国的种族主义者2日晚又在黑人聚居的伦敦诺丁山区进行了挑衅袭击。约有一百名暴徒在大街上高喊“打死黑人！”他们还从汽车上向黑人住宅投掷了装有燃料的瓶子。
    这次袭击是英国的种族主义者最近几天来在这个地区进行的第三次结伙袭击。这种猖狂的反对西印度群岛和英国其他殖民地来的黑人移民的运动已经引起了英国舆论的反对。舆论认为，这不是偶然的无赖挑衅，而是有意挑起的种族纠纷。英国许多报纸在3日的消息中都指出，流氓种族主义分子同重新抬头的法西斯分子有着联系。路透社也说，“最近三天的流血冲突，是法西斯分子影响的结果。”
    4日的“每日简报”报道，在英国发现了一个反黑种人组织。
    这家报纸说，这个组织同南非的种族隔离分子以及美国极南部的小石城和密士失必州的“仇视黑人分子”都保持着密切接触。
    已经发现在英国的伯明翰、伦敦、考文垂和萨利的克拉顿等地都有这个组织的支持者。
    “每日简报”上刊登的另一篇文章指出，“危险的新因素是：他们从某些政界人士那里得到鼓励，甚至可能得到指示。这些政界人士是‘联盟运动’（编者注：这是英国法西斯联盟战后的名称）的积极分子。”
    最近几天来在伦敦发生的迫害黑人的骚乱引起了国内外强烈的抗议。
    这里的许多人都厌恶这种反对有色人的暴行。二十多位著名的舞台和电视演员联名发表的一项抗议书说，这是“暴力代替了理智”。
    同时，在英国发生的这种仇恨黑人的行动已经在有色人的国家里引起了震惊和不安。
    英国报纸揭露的英美种族主义者有密切联系的事情，并不是没有根据的。据纽约消息，美国的种族主义者近来气焰也极其猖獗。在新学年开始的时候，美国南部许多州的立法当局和行政当局匆匆采取了许多种族歧视的措施，不许黑人和白人同校。
    阿肯色州州长福布斯在该州州议会的支持下打算在小石城各学校开学的头一天，封闭那些白种和黑种儿童同校的学校。
    美国南部有七个州的法律规定，一旦黑种儿童在学校出现，就可以封闭这些学校。
    在弗吉尼亚州，爱林顿地方学校委员会在州当局的同意下，最近通过了拒绝接受三十名黑人学生进入白人学校的决定。
    在阿肯色州的范布伦，六个黑人学生在3日说，他们不得不从当地学校中退学，因为他们在学校中经常遭到威胁和种族主义者的侮辱。黑人学生到处碰到“滚回家去”的标语，并且有人用石头袭击他们。而警察们对此不加过问。
    种族主义者正在叫嚷说，黑白同校“会造成秩序混乱和发生暴力行动”。
    美国最高法院原来准备在今年处理关于在小石城实行黑白合校的原则的问题，但是至今也没有作出什么决定，而且把处理这个问题的日期推迟到9月11日。美国报刊认为，最高法院这样做是由于美国总统在法院开会前夕发表了关于合校过程应该放慢的声明。
    在阻止黑白学生同校的同时，美国许多地区又正在煽动种族仇恨和袭击黑人居民。据报道，在南部各州的某些城市里电线杆子上出现了吊着的假黑人。一个以残暴出名的种族主义者卡斯佩尔正在组织所谓“志愿军”来迫害那些不屈服的黑人。
