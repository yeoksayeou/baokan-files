Xinhua News Agency, September 20th. The University of Science and Technology of China, which aims to cultivate top-notch scientific research talent with communist consciousness, officially opened today. It is a new type of "red and expert" institution of higher learning, located in the outskirts of Beijing. The university has 1,600 students, 70% of whom are children of workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres, all of whom are outstanding high school graduates with excellent political qualities and academic achievements, selected through strict examination. Starting today, they will begin a life of combining intensive study and labor.

This university is jointly established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Education. Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, serves concurrently as the President of the University. Yu Wen is the Party Committee Secretary, and Jin Zengyi, Zhang Xinming, and Tian Fu are the Deputy Secretaries. The faculty is mainly composed of senior researchers from various institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The university currently has thirteen departments: Nuclear Physics and Nuclear Engineering, Technical Physics, Applied Geophysics, Chemical Physics, Radio Electronics, Radiochemistry and Radiation Chemistry, Physical Thermotics, Polymer Chemistry and Polymer Physics, Applied Mathematics and Computational Technology, Mechanics, Biophysics, Automation, Geochemistry and Rare Elements.

This university was established from scratch in just three months with the care and support of the Party and the government. It received assistance from many units during the construction process, so it is a product of communist collaboration.

This morning, all faculty and students held a grand opening ceremony at the main campus. Vice Premier of the State Council Nie Rongzhen, President of Renmin University of China Wu Yuzhang, Vice Presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Zhang Jingfu, Tao Menghe, and Wu Youxun, Vice President of Peking University Zhou Peiyuan, and officials from the Ministry of Education and other relevant departments attended the ceremony.

President Guo Moruo delivered a speech at the ceremony. He said: "We will certainly be able to quickly build our university into a model 'red and expert' university, a new type of communist university. In order to achieve this task, according to the instructions of the Party, our entire university must achieve 'Three Guidelines and Five Transformations'." The "Three Guidelines" he mentioned are: First, putting politics in command, strong leadership of the Party; second, combining diligence and thrift in study, integrating teaching, research, and productive labor; third, focusing on cutting-edge science and technology to serve the national construction cause. The "Five Transformations" are: ideological Marxism-Leninism, life becoming worker-peasant-like, organization militarization, teaching collectivization, and diversified skills. These are the steps and guidelines to achieve the Three Guidelines.

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen gave instructions at the ceremony. He said: Because China's current scientific and technological strength is far from meeting the needs of national construction, measures must be taken to vigorously cultivate new forces. We once advocated that a new type of university should be established, one that is close to research institutions, with the latest science and technology in the world as the main courses, selecting outstanding high school graduates, giving them relatively strict training in basic scientific knowledge and technical operation, and letting students participate in practical work in relevant research institutions in their third and fourth years, quickly mastering professional knowledge, and accelerating the cultivation of new scientific cadres, so that in a short period of time, China's most urgently needed missing fields, gaps, and emerging disciplines can catch up with the advanced countries. This proposal has now been realized. After a very short period of time, under the direct leadership of President Guo Moruo, the preparatory work was carried out, and a new type of communist university - the University of Science and Technology of China - was born. This will be a major event written in China's educational and scientific history. This school is different from ordinary polytechnic universities; it mainly cultivates the latest cutting-edge science and technology cadres in the world.

Vice Premier Nie said: The Party Central Committee and the State Council today announced an instruction on education work. This instruction determines that education serves proletarian politics, education is combined with productive labor, education work must be led by the Party, and must follow the mass line. This instruction is the guide for us to run this university well and is the most important guarantee for building a new type of communist university.

Subsequently, Wu Yuzhang, Zhou Peiyuan, Deputy Dean of the PLA Political Academy Mo Wenhua, and student representatives spoke at the meeting.

Before the opening of the school, faculty, staff, and students had already established five factories: ferrite, potassium permanganate, iron oxide, electronic computer, and electronic instrument factories.

    我国教育史和科学史上的重大事件
    中国科学技术大学开学
    主要培养具有共产主义觉悟的尖端科学研究人材
    新华社20日讯　培养具有共产主义觉悟的尖端科学研究人材的中国科学技术大学，今天正式开学。它是一座新型的红专学府，设立在北京近郊。全校有一千六百名学生，他们中间70％是工农和革命干部的子弟，都是经过严格考选，政治品质和学业成绩优良的高中毕业生。今天起，他们就要开始紧张的学习和劳动相结合的生活。
    这个学校是中国科学院和教育部联合举办的。中国科学院院长郭沫若兼任校长，党委书记是郁文，副书记是晋曾毅、张新铭、田夫。教师大多由中国科学院各研究所的高级研究人员担任。学校现设原子核物理和原子核工程、技术物理、应用地球物理、化学物理、无线电电子学、放射化学和辐射化学、物理热工、高分子化学和高分子物理、应用数学和计算技术、力学、生物物理、自动化、地球化学和稀有元素等十三个系。
    这座大学是在党和政府的关切和支持下，在短短三个月中从无到有地建立起来的。建设过程中，得到了许多单位的帮助，所以它是共产主义协作的产物。
    今天上午，全校师生在校本部举行了隆重的开学典礼。国务院副总理聂荣臻，中国人民大学校长吴玉章，中国科学院副院长张劲夫、陶孟和、吴有训，北京大学副校长周培源，以及教育部等有关部门的负责人，都参加了典礼。
    郭沫若校长在典礼上致词。他说：“我们一定能够很快地把我们的学校办成模范的红专大学，办成为新型的共产主义大学。为了实现这个任务，根据党的指示，我们全校要作到‘三纲五化’。”他说的三纲是：一、政治挂帅，党的坚强领导；二、勤工俭学，教学、研究和生产劳动相结合；三、抓尖端科学技术，为国家建设事业服务。“五化”是：思想马克思列宁主义化，生活工农化，组织军事化，教学集体化和技能多面化，这些是实现三纲的步骤和方针。
    聂荣臻副总理在典礼上作了指示。他说：由于目前我国科学技术力量远远不能适应国家建设事业发展的需要，因此必须采取措施，大力培养新生力量。我们曾经倡议过：应当开办一种新型的大学，这种大学和研究机构靠在一起，以世界最新的科学技术为主要课程，选拔优秀的高中毕业生，给以比较严格的科学基本知识和技术操作的训练，在三、四年级时，让学生到相关的研究机构中参加实际工作，迅速掌握业务知识，加快新的科学干部的培养，以便在短时期内使我国最急需的缺门、空白和新兴学科的力量赶上先进国家水平。这个倡议现在实现了。经过很短的时间，在郭沫若院长直接领导下进行了筹备工作，一个共产主义的新型大学——中国科学技术大学诞生了。这将是写在我国教育史和科学史上的一项重大事件。这个学校不同于一般理工大学，它主要的是培养目前世界上最新的尖端性的科学技术干部。
    聂副总理说：党中央和国务院今天公布了一项关于教育工作的指示，在这个指示中，确定了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合，教育工作必须由党来领导，必须走群众路线等重要方针。这个指示，就是我们办好这座大学的行动的指南，是建设一座共产主义的新型的大学的最重要的保证。
    接着，吴玉章、周培源、解放军政治学院副院长莫文骅和学生代表等都在会上讲了话。
    这个学校在开学前，教职员工和学生已经办起了铁氧体、高锰酸钾、氧化铁、电子计算机和电子学仪器等五个工厂。
