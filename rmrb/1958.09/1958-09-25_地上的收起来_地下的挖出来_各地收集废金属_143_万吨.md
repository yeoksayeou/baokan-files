Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: The vigorous mass industrial "drought relief" campaign underway across the country has achieved remarkable results. According to the National Bureau of Statistics' figures up to the 20th, twenty-one provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have dug up 1.43 million tons of scrap metal. While vigorously excavating scrap steel, various usable mechanical equipment has also been collected in large quantities across the country.

The shortage of steel and other metal materials is a major difficulty encountered in the great leap forward in industry and agriculture in various places. Faced with this problem, in addition to deciding to accelerate the development of steel production, various localities have also launched large-scale campaigns to collect scrap metal in the past one or two months. The result of this campaign is not only that various places have quickly collected a large amount of scrap steel to support the steel and machinery industries, but it has also greatly strengthened the confidence of the broad masses in self-reliance to solve the temporary difficulties that have arisen in the Great Leap Forward.

The broad masses participating in the industrial "drought relief" campaign deeply understand the great significance of this campaign, and therefore showed great enthusiasm. In Liaoning Province, which has already collected 340,000 tons of scrap metal, millions of urban and rural people have participated in the campaign. Many places throughout the province have established industrial "drought relief" headquarters led by secretaries in charge, and more than 10,000 "scrap recycling teams," "treasure digging teams," and "shock teams" have been spontaneously organized by the masses. In Guangzhou City, since the beginning of September, the number of people participating in picking up scrap steel has increased to hundreds of thousands. Among them are not only officers and soldiers, cadres of organs, employees of factories and enterprises, and teachers and students, but also many white-haired elderly people and Young Pioneers in various streets have participated in this movement.

In border areas and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, this movement has also reached a very wide extent. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region alone, the "expedition teams" and "shock teams" organized by various places to collect scrap steel have reached 400,000 to 500,000 people per day at most.

Some areas that initially believed that there was not much "profit" to be made have also made good achievements after opposing conservative ideas and fully mobilizing the masses. For example, in Shanghai, at the beginning of collecting scrap steel, some people felt that scrap steel had been continuously collected in recent years, and factories had also engaged in increasing production, practicing economy, and clearing inventories every year, so collecting it again now would not amount to much. However, after the city resolutely mobilized the masses according to the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, it has collected more than 120,000 tons of various scrap metals in less than a month. The masses were mobilized and their enthusiasm was very high. They proposed "Pick up what's on the ground, dig up what's underground," "Don't leave out a nail or a needle, don't stop until it's clean and shiny."

### 地上的收起来  地下的挖出来  各地收集废金属143万吨

    地上的收起来  地下的挖出来
    各地收集废金属143万吨
    据新华社24日讯  全国各地正在开展的轰轰烈烈的群众性工业“抗旱”运动已经取得显著成绩。据国家统计局截至20日的统计，二十一个省、市、自治区挖掘出来的废金属已达一百四十三万吨。在大挖废钢铁的同时，各地还收集了大量的各种可用的机械设备。
    钢铁和其他金属材料不足，是各地工农业大跃进中碰到的主要困难。面对着这一问题，各地除了决定加快速度发展钢铁生产外，并在最近一两个月里先后开展了声势浩大的收集废旧金属的运动。这一运动开展的结果，不仅使各地迅速收集了大量废旧钢铁支援了炼钢工业和机械工业，同时也大大地坚定了广大群众自力更生解决大跃进中出现的暂时困难的信心。
    参加工业“抗旱”运动的广大群众深切地知道这一运动的巨大意义，因此表现了高度的热情。已经收集了三十四万吨废旧金属的辽宁省，参加运动的城乡群众多到几百万人。全省许多地方都已建立了书记挂帅、亲自领导的工业“抗旱”指挥部，群众自动组织起来的“废料回收队”、“挖宝队”、“突击队”等有一万多个。广州市从9月初以来，参加拣废钢铁的人数已经增加到几十万人。他们中间不仅有部队官兵、机关干部、工厂企业职工和学校师生，在各街道里许多白发苍苍的老年人和带红领巾的少年儿童，也都参加了这一运动。
    在边疆地区和少数民族聚居区，这一运动也达到了十分广泛的程度。新疆维吾尔自治区单是各地组织的收集废钢铁的“远征队”、“突击队”，最多时每天就有四、五十万人。
    一些开始认为“油水”不大的地区，在经过反对保守思想和充分发动群众之后，也都作出了很好的成绩。例如上海市，在收集废钢铁开始之初，有些人觉得近年来曾不断收集废钢铁，工厂也年年搞增产节约、清理库存，现在再收集也凑不出大数。但是全市根据中共上海市委的指示，坚决发动了群众之后，在不到一个月的时间里，就已收集了十二万多吨各种废旧金属。群众发动起来，热情很高。他们提出“地上的收起来，地下的挖出来”，“一钉一针不遗漏，不净不光不收兵”。
