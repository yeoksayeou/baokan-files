Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 12th: According to Kyodo News Agency, the Japan Socialist Party held a joint meeting of the Policy Deliberation Council, the International Bureau, and the Special Committee for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations in the Diet Building on the afternoon of the 11th. The meeting analyzed the issue of breaking the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations and the current situation as follows, and determined the basic policy. The Socialist Party then held a Central Executive Committee meeting and formally approved the following basic policy.

I. Analysis of the Situation: The Japan Socialist Party has consistently advocated the restoration of formal and comprehensive diplomatic relations between China and Japan and has been working towards this goal. The Socialist Party's policy is: "Not to recognize the existence of two Chinas, Taiwan is China's internal affair, and hope that the international tension surrounding Taiwan will be resolved peacefully. The right of representation in the United Nations should belong to the People's Republic of China." This point has been clearly stated in the joint statement by Inejiro Asanuma and Zhang Xiruo.

	(1) True Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations refer to the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China;
	(2) China maintains its position as a country with strength not only in Asia but also in the world. Therefore, the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations is of great contribution to international peace;
	(3) It is beneficial for both countries, and it is also the way for our country to seek development and prosperity, for Japan, which does not belong to any camp, to promote economic and cultural exchanges with China based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, equality, and mutual benefit.

II. Basic Policies for Breaking the Deadlock in Sino-Japanese Relations:

	(1) Demand that the Nobusuke Kishi government change its policy:
		(A) Cease taking all actions that recognize the existence of two Chinas and restore diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China;
		(B) The Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and the international tension surrounding the Taiwan issue should be resolved peacefully by all relevant countries;
		(C) Do not participate in military systems such as the Northeast Asia Treaty Organization (North Pacific Treaty Organization) targeting China;
		(D) Do not bring nuclear weapons into Japan;
		(E) Support the People's Republic of China's right of representation in the United Nations through the United Nations and other organizations;
		(F) Express regret for the national flag incident in Nagasaki and take all necessary measures to ensure respect for the national flag of the People's Republic of China in the future;
		(G) Expand personnel, cultural, technical, and economic exchanges on a friendly and equal basis, and actively support and cooperate in ways that do not hinder the normalization of diplomatic relations. In particular, fully implement the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

	Regarding the issue surrounding the Taiwan Strait, militarily supporting the Nationalist government (referring to the Chiang gang), especially the U.S. military's presence in Taiwan, will intensify tensions in Asia. The Japanese government should respond with the following correct attitude:

		(A) Oppose U.S. military intervention;
		(B) The Kuomintang army (referring to the Chiang army) should withdraw from the Jinmen and Mazu islands;
		(C) Oppose the use of military bases in Japan;
		(D) In order to peacefully resolve the Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan issues, support the early holding of U.S.-China talks and hope that the talks will be successful.

	(2) Launch a National Movement: The Socialist Party will launch a national movement to strive for the restoration and normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

		(A) Broadly unite the strength of the entire nation and launch a strong movement to strive for the Nobusuke Kishi government to comprehensively change its policy;
		(B) Considering that it is very difficult for the current Nobusuke Kishi government to break the current deadlock, prepare to launch a long-term and persistent movement;
		(C) When launching this movement, closely coordinate with movements against atomic and hydrogen bombs, demanding the return of Okinawa, opposing military bases, and defending the Constitution;
		(D) Our party will unite labor unions, farmers' associations, youth and women's groups, various economic, cultural, and democratic groups, and even mobilize conscientious members of the financial and business circles and conservative parties to participate in the movement. In particular, we must strengthen the National Conference for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, with which our party is currently cooperating, and actively launch the movement through this organization.

	(3) Our party will also, based on the achievements of the above-mentioned national movement and the struggle to demand that the Nobusuke Kishi government change its policy, request that the Chinese side, in accordance with the spirit of the joint statement of Inejiro Asanuma and Zhang Xiruo, actively cooperate in improving Sino-Japanese relations.

    日本社会党制定基本方针
    展开国民运动争取恢复日中邦交
    要求岸政府改变政策不再承认有“两个中国”
    台湾问题是中国内政反对美国的军事干涉
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：据共同社报道，日本社会党11日下午在国会大厅举行政策审议会、国际局、恢复日中邦交特别委员会联席会议，就打开日中关系僵局问题和对形势作了如下的分析，并且确定了基本方针。社会党接着举行中央执行委员会会议，正式批准了下述基本方针。
    一、对形势的分析：日本社会党始终主张恢复日中两国正式而且全面的邦交，并且一直进行努力。社会党的方针是：“不承认存在着两个中国，台湾是中国的内政问题，希望围绕着台湾的国际紧张局势得到和平解决。在联合国的代表权应该属于中华人民共和国。”这点已经由浅沼稻次郎、张奚若共同声明所明确表明了。
    （1）真正的日中邦交，是指日本和中华人民共和国政府所建立的邦交；
    （2）中国保有不仅在亚洲、而且在世界上拥有实力的国家的地位。因此，恢复日中邦交，对国际和平的贡献是巨大的；
    （3）不属于任何阵营的日本同中国根据和平共处、平等互惠的原则促进经济和文化的交流，这对两国都是有利的，也是我国求得发展和繁荣的道路。
    二、打开日中关系僵局的基本政策：
    （1）要求岸信介政府改变政策：
    （甲）不再采取承认有两个中国存在的一切行动，同中华人民共和国恢复邦交；
    （乙）台湾问题是中国的内政问题，围绕台湾问题的国际紧张局势要由各有关国家求得和平的解决；
    （丙）不参加以中国为对象的东北亚条约组织（北太平洋条约组织）之类的军事体系；
    （丁）不把核武器运进日本国内；
    （戊）通过联合国和其他机构，支持中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权；
    （己）要就长崎的国旗事件表示歉意，并且要采取万全的措施，以保证今后尊重中华人民共和国的国旗；
    （庚）要在友好、平等的基础上扩大人员、文化、技术、经济的交流，在不妨碍邦交正常化的情况下予以积极的支持并且实行合作。特别要完全实施第四次日中贸易协定。
    就围绕台湾海峡的问题来说，在军事上支援国民政府（按指蒋帮），特别是美军驻在台湾，将会加剧亚洲的紧张局势。日本政府应当以如下的正确态度加以应付：
    （A）反对美国进行军事干涉；
    （B）国府军（按指蒋军）应从金门、马祖两岛撤退；
    （C）反对使用日本国内的军事基地；
    （D）为了和平地解决金门、马祖两岛和台湾问题，支持早日举行美中会谈，并且希望会谈能够获得成功。
    （2）展开国民运动：社会党将展开争取恢复日中邦交并使它正常化的国民运动。
    （甲）要广泛地团结全体国民的力量，强有力地展开运动，争取使岸信介政府全面地改变政策；
    （乙）由目前的岸信介政府打开目前的僵局，是非常困难的，根据这种看法，要作好能够展开长期而且坚持不懈的运动的准备工作；
    （丙）在展开这个运动的时候，要同反对原子弹和氢弹、要求归还冲绳、反对军事基地、保卫宪法等运动密切配合；
    （丁）我党将团结工会、农民协会、青年妇女团体、各经济、文化、民主团体等，甚至要动员金融实业界和保守党派中有良心的分子参加运动、特别要加强我党正在实行合作的恢复日中邦交国民会议，通过这个团体积极地展开运动。
    （3）我党也将根据上述国民运动和要求岸信介政府改变政策的斗争所获得的成就，要求中国方面按照浅沼稻次郎、张奚若共同声明的精神，在改善日中关系方面积极实行合作。
