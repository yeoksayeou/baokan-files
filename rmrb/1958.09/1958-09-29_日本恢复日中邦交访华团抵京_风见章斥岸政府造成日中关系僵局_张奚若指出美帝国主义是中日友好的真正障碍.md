Xinhua News Agency, September 28th - Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, held a banquet at noon today to welcome the delegation of the National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, headed by Kazami Akira.

In his speech at the beginning of the banquet, President Zhang Xiruo said: It is of special significance that we are able to welcome the delegation of the National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, headed by Mr. Kazami Akira, at a time when the Chinese people are resolutely struggling to recover Jinmen and Mazu and liberate Taiwan, and are engaged in a sharp struggle against the armed interference and military provocations of U.S. imperialism.

Zhang Xiruo said: Taiwan is the territory of the People's Republic of China, and we must liberate it. No external force can prevent this. Jinmen and Mazu are within China's inland sea, and the Chinese people cannot tolerate the occupation of these islands by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, supported by U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people must liberate these islands. If the U.S. imperialists dare to provoke a war of aggression, we will resolutely strike back, including their accomplices.

Zhang Xiruo said: We warmly welcome the National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations for its firm and correct attitude on Sino-Japanese relations, especially on the Taiwan issue. We also welcome the basic policy recently announced by the Japanese Socialist Party to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations. The Japanese Communist Party has also continuously issued statements opposing the Kishi Nobusuke's policy of hostility towards our country and U.S. imperialism's creation of tension in the Taiwan Strait. These not only express friendship towards the Chinese people, but also truly represent the interests of the broad masses of the Japanese people. Now, we are pleased to see that more and more Japanese people are in favor of restoring diplomatic relations and establishing friendly relations with the People's Republic of China, and oppose the conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Kishi Nobusuke's policy of hostility towards our country has been opposed by more and more Japanese people. Our friendly attitude towards the Japanese people has not changed in the past, does not change now, and will not change in the future. Although the Kishi Nobusuke government has not changed its policy of hostility towards our country, we still warmly welcome you, and the friendly exchanges between our two peoples will continue. The real obstacle to the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples is U.S. imperialism. Therefore, the Chinese and Japanese peoples must unite to shatter this obstacle, and then the relationship between China and Japan can embark on a broad and smooth road.

In his speech at the banquet, Kazami Akira first stated that he would "keep President Zhang Xiruo's speech in mind." He said: The current stalemate in Sino-Japanese relations is due to the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards the Chinese people. The Kishi Nobusuke government should be primarily responsible for this stalemate. However, the fact that the Japanese people have allowed a government like Kishi Nobusuke to emerge also shows the weakness of the Japanese peace movement, and therefore we feel our own responsibility.

Kazami Akira said: Japan has now become a U.S. military base, and the Kishi Nobusuke government has become an accomplice of the United States. If the United States madly provokes a war, Japan will become a battlefield. Therefore, the movement to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations is still a widespread concern of the Japanese people and needs to be further strengthened. But what is more important at present is probably to strengthen the struggle for the Japanese nation to gain true independence. Only in this way can Japan be spared the war provoked by the United States. Japan has now become an accomplice of the United States. The headquarters of the U.S. Seventh Fleet is located in Yokosuka, and the U.S. Marines also depart from here to Taiwan. However, because the Japanese government strictly controls the news, the Japanese people are vaguely unaware of the danger of Japan's current situation.

Kazami Akira said: On the Taiwan issue, world public opinion is on the side of the Chinese people, and China's determination to liberate Taiwan will surely be realized. He finally raised his glass to wish China an early liberation of Taiwan and to wish China victory in the struggle to crush U.S. military provocations.

Those who attended today's banquet included Liao Chengzhi, Chu Tunan, Nan Hanchen, Wu Defeng, Li Zhuchen, Zhou Gengsheng, Qiao Guanhua, Xie Nanguang and many other responsible persons from relevant people's organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, September 28th - The delegation of the National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, led by Kazami Akira, Chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, and deputy heads Hosokawa Kakuro and Ito Takeo, a group of thirteen people, arrived in Beijing by train on the 28th. They are visiting our country at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

Those who welcomed them at the station included Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Asian-African Solidarity Committee, Kinkazu Saionji, Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, and many others.

    日本恢复日中邦交访华团抵京
    风见章斥岸政府造成日中关系僵局
    张奚若指出美帝国主义是中日友好的真正障碍
    新华社28日讯  中国人民外交学会会长张奚若今天中午举行宴会，欢迎以风见章团长为首的日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华代表团全体人员。
    张奚若会长在宴会开始时致词说：正当中国人民坚决为收复金门、马祖和解放台湾而奋斗，以及同美帝国主义的武装干涉和军事挑衅进行尖锐斗争的时候，我们能够欢迎以风见章先生为首的日本恢复日中邦交国民会议的代表团，这是有特别意义的。
    张奚若说：台湾是中华人民共和国的领土，我们一定要解放，这是任何外力都不能阻止的。金门、马祖在我国内海范围内，中国人民更不能容忍被美帝国主义支持的蒋介石集团盘踞在这些岛屿上，中国人民一定要解放这些岛屿。如果美帝国主义者敢于挑起侵略战争，我们就给以坚决的回击，包括它的帮凶在内。
    张奚若说：我们十分欢迎日本恢复日中邦交国民会议在中日关系上，尤其是对台湾问题所表示的坚定的正确的态度。我们也欢迎日本社会党最近发表的打开中日关系僵局的基本方针。日本共产党也连续发表了反对岸信介敌视我国的政策和美帝国主义在台湾海峡制造紧张局势的主张。这些不仅表示对中国人民的友好，也真正代表日本广大人民的利益。现在，我们高兴地看到日本人民越来越多的赞成与中华人民共和国恢复邦交和建立友好关系、反对制造“两个中国”的阴谋。岸信介敌视我国的政策已遭到越来越多的日本人民的反对。我们对日本人民的友好态度无论过去、现在或将来都不会改变。尽管岸信介政府还未改变敌视我国的政策，我们依然是热烈欢迎你们，而且我们两国人民之间的友好往来还要继续进行。真正妨碍中日两国人民友好的是美帝国主义，因此，中日两国人民必须团结起来，粉碎这种障碍，然后中日两国的关系才能走上康庄大道。
    风见章在宴会上的讲话中首先表示要把张奚若会长的讲话“铭记在心里”。他说：日中关系陷于今天的僵局，是由于岸信介政府采取了敌视中国人民的政策。这种僵局应该首先由岸信介政府负责的。但是日本人民竟容许了像岸信介这样的政府出现，也表明了日本和平运动的软弱无力，因此感到了我们自己的责任。
    风见章说：日本现在已变成美国的军事基地，岸信介政府已经成为美国的帮凶，如果美国疯狂地挑起战争，日本就要成为战场，因此，恢复日中邦交的运动，仍是日本人民所普遍关心的，需要继续加强，但是当前更重要的，恐怕是加强日本民族获得真正独立的斗争，也只有如此，日本才能免除美国挑起的战争。日本现在已经成为美国的帮凶，美国第七舰队的司令部就设在横须贺，而美国的陆战队也由这里开往台湾。但是由于日本政府严密地控制着新闻，日本人民对日本目前处境的危险性是懵懵然不甚清楚的。
    风见章说：在台湾问题上，世界舆论都站在中国人民的一边，中国解放台湾的决心一定会实现。他最后举杯祝中国早日解放台湾，祝中国粉碎美国军事挑衅的斗争胜利。
    参加今天宴会的，有有关人民团体的负责人廖承志、楚图南、南汉宸、吴德峰、李烛尘、周鲠生、乔冠华、谢南光等多人。
    新华社28日讯  日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华代表团在团长、恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章、副团长细川嘉六、伊藤武雄的率领下一行十三人已于28日乘火车到达北京。他们是应中国人民外交学会的邀请来我国进行友好访问的。
    到车站欢迎的有中国人民外交学会会长张奚若、亚非团结委员会主席廖承志、亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会副秘书长西园寺公一等多人。
