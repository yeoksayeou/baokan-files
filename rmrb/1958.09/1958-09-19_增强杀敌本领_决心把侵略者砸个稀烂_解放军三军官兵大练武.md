Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: Over the past ten days, from the foot of Changbai Mountain to the Kangzang Plateau, from the coast of the East China Sea to the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed throughout the country, enraged by the military provocations and war threats of U.S. imperialism, have been diligently studying and practicing day and night with full anti-aggression anger, launching an overwhelming training upsurge. Frontline soldiers are learning while fighting, becoming stronger as they fight, and the ability of the rear soldiers to kill the enemy is becoming more refined as they practice. They are determined that when the enemy dares to impose war on our country, they will use unparalleled combat power to smash the invaders to pieces.

On the coastal defense front, officers and soldiers, with the spirit of "advancing further with each battle and growing wiser with each flight," are using every battle interval to promptly summarize combat experience and learn new tactics and techniques. In each post-air combat evaluation of a certain air force unit, new experiences and new problems are identified, and new tricks that the enemy may use in the next battle are studied, and training is conducted during combat intervals. In a recent air battle, the enemy's movements were exactly the same as they had anticipated in advance, so they fought a beautiful aerial annihilation battle. In artillery and anti-aircraft artillery units, training for "all-around gunners" and "overall excellence" is carried out. In artillery battles, each gunner can alternate operations with each other, and no matter how fierce the battle, the cannons never stop roaring. Cooks, sergeants, clerks, health workers, and office cadres in these units have also become "all-rounders," learning the actions of several gunners and observers, and some have become excellent artillery commanders who can direct artillery operations.

The rear troops, with the lofty aspiration of being ready to go to the front line to strike the invaders at any time, have made rapid progress in combat training in the past few days. After a certain artillery unit achieved "all-around gunners" and "overall excellence," after several days and nights of hard training, 58% of the gunners learned the command actions of the gun vehicle commander, and 30% of the gunners learned to drive the gun vehicle. Zhang Yongshan, the platoon leader of a certain artillery unit that participated in the Yijiangshan battle, said: We are excellent in daytime shooting, and we are also excellent in nighttime shooting. We can fight on land, we can fight at sea, and we can also fight on islands. In the battles to liberate Kinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan, we guarantee to hit wherever the infantry points and bury the enemy under our artillery fire.

"All-rounders" in the naval forces are emerging in a surging tide. A certain naval vessel unit stationed in Qingdao, after five days and six nights of intensive training, has achieved "all-around combat positions," and everyone has become an "all-around sailor" who can go to wherever they are needed to fight. Under the slogan of "everyone is a teacher, everywhere is a classroom," a certain Marine Corps detachment has learned to use five kinds of weapons, and each communication soldier has learned "three abilities" and "four abilities." The "all-around tank soldier" movement carried out by the armored forces has recently reported frequent good news, and all-around tank soldiers are emerging in batches. A certain heroic battalion stationed in the Changbai Mountain area, under the slogan of "turning anger into strength," has achieved "all-around marksman battalion" ahead of schedule. The soldiers said: We can not only use our own weapons to eliminate the enemy, but also use all kinds of guns to strike the enemy. After "all-around" abilities were achieved in a certain infantry regiment, everyone learned to swim, and now they can swim across water, with no rivers being an obstacle. They strive to cross rivers fully armed without boats. A certain air force unit has also produced a group of "all-around mechanics" and "all-around special equipment teams" who can complete tasks in combat by "doing the work of ten, or even a hundred." After the anti-aggression oath-taking rally, officers and soldiers of a certain air force unit stationed in the Chengdu area put forward more than 1,100 rationalization proposals for combat training, further improving the combat power of the "Iron Eagles."

In the midst of the heated training, the rear troops actively learned from the frontline combat experience. Many air force units are learning the heroic fighting spirit and flexible tactical movements of Zhou Chunfu, a wingman pilot who shot down and damaged three enemy aircraft. Naval units stationed in the Guangzhou area are also actively learning from the combat experience of the naval forces on the Fujian front.

In recent days, the various logistics departments have also been working day and night to step up training for wartime supply work. They guarantee that once the invaders launch a war, they will provide the front line with sufficient food and ammunition to fully meet the needs of the front line. Many hospitals have strengthened the study of battlefield rescue and nursing.

    增强杀敌本领　决心把侵略者砸个稀烂
    解放军三军官兵大练武
    新华社18日讯　十天来，从长白山麓到康藏高原，从东海之滨到天山南北，被美帝国主义的军事挑衅和战争威胁激怒了的中国人民解放军驻全国各地部队，怀着满腔反侵略怒火，日夜苦学勤练，掀起了一个排山倒海的练兵热潮，前线将士边战斗边学习越战越强，后方官兵的杀敌本领，越练越精。他们决心在敌人敢于把战争强加在我国头上的时候，以无比强大的战斗威力，把侵略者砸个稀烂。
    在海防前线，官兵们以“打一仗进一步，飞一次长一智”的精神，利用每一个战斗间隙及时总结战斗经验，学习新的战术技术。空军某部在每次空战后的战评总结中，都找出了新的经验和新问题，并研究出下次战斗中敌人可能采用的新花样，进行战斗间隙训练。在最近一次空战中，敌机的活动和他们事先估计的一模一样，因此打了一个漂亮的空中歼灭战。在炮兵和高射炮兵部队里，开展了“全能炮手”和“全面优秀”的训练，炮战中每个炮手都能相互交替操作，任何激烈的战斗大炮从不停止怒吼。这些部队里的炊事员、上士、文书、卫生员以及机关干部也都做了“多面手”，学会几个炮手和观测手的动作，有的还成了出色炮长，能指挥炮兵作战。
    后方的部队，在随时准备开赴前线打击侵略者的壮志下，这几天的战斗训练成绩突飞猛进。某炮兵部队实现了“全能炮手”、“全面优秀”以后，经过几天的日夜苦练，有58％的炮手学会了炮车长的指挥动作，30％的炮手学会了驾驶炮车。参加过一江山战斗的某炮兵部队张永善排长说：我们白天射击是优秀，夜间射击也是优秀，在陆上能打，海上能打，岛上也能打，在解放金门、马祖和台湾的战斗中，步兵指到哪里，我们保证打到哪里，把敌人埋葬在我们的炮火之下。
    海军部队的“全能手”，在汹涌澎湃地涌现着。驻青岛的某舰艇部队，经过五天六夜的突击训练，达到了“战位全能”，每一个人都成了哪里需要到哪里去作战的“全能水兵”。在“人人是教员，处处是课堂”的口号下，某海军陆战分队学会了使用五种武器，每个通讯兵学会了“三能”和“四能”。装甲兵部队开展的“全能坦克手”运动，最近几天捷报频传，全能坦克手成批地出现。驻长白山地区的某英雄营，在“化愤怒为力量”的口号下，提前实现了“全能枪手营”，战士们说：我们不仅能用自己手中武器消灭敌人，而且能用一切枪枝打击敌人。某步兵团在“全能”之后，人人学游泳，现在可以遇水泅水，江河无阻，力争全副武装强渡江河不用船。空军某部还出现了一批“全能机械师”和“全能特设组”，在战斗中能够“一当十，十当百”地完成任务。驻成都地区的某空军部队在反侵略宣誓大会以后，官兵提出了一千一百多条战斗训练的合理化建议，使“铁鹰”的战斗威力更加提高。
    各后方部队在热火朝天的训练中，积极学习了前线作战经验。许多空军部队正在学习僚机飞行员周春富击落击伤敌机三架的英勇战斗精神和灵活的战术动作。驻广州地区的海军部队也在积极学习福建前线海军的战斗经验。
    连日来，各个后勤部门也在夜以继日地加紧训练战时供应工作，他们保证，一旦侵略者发动战争，他们要使前线要粮有粮，要弹有弹，充分满足前线需要。许多医院加强了战场抢救和护理的学习。
