Steel production surges daily in early September.
In the first five days, daily steel production increased by 4% compared to last month, and iron increased by 14%; in the latter five days, steel increased to 12.8%, and iron rose to 38%.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Our correspondent reports: "During the day, carriages and horses bustle on the roads and paths, and people transporting 'provisions' for the steel marshal come and go in endless streams; at night, thousands of lights illuminate the mountains, and tens of thousands of people fight for steel through the night." - This is how our correspondent in Shaanxi described the scene last night in a long-distance phone call of the entire party and all the people in Shaanxi fighting for steel; in fact, this is also a portrayal of the entire steel industry front across the country.

After the Party Central Committee issued the solemn call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel, in the first ten days of September, all parts of the country immediately organized a powerful steel army with overwhelming momentum. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 20 million people working hard day and night on the steel production front across the country.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, in the ten days from September 1st to 10th, the average daily steel production across the country increased by 8.8% compared to August, and pig iron increased by 18.5%. The daily output of steel and pig iron also increased day by day during this period. In the five days from September 1st to 5th, the average daily steel production increased by 4% compared to August, and the daily pig iron production increased by 14%; in the latter five days, the growth rate of steel reached 12.8%, and iron also rapidly increased to 38%. With the rapid increase in steel production, some areas that had previously had very low output or even no steel production have already hoisted the red flag of steel abundance. In the first five days of September, Hunan Province only produced an average of 1,100 tons of iron per day, but on the 10th, it jumped to 3,273 tons; on the 10th, Guizhou Province's pig iron production reached 2,217 tons, an increase of more than two times compared to the average daily output in the first five days of September, and the province's annual pig iron production plan has been completed by 88.5%. As of the 10th, Henan, Sichuan, and Shanxi were also producing more than 1,000 tons of pig iron per day.

The employees of the dozen or so key steel enterprises that bear the task of producing the vast majority of the country's steel output are at the forefront of the nationwide effort to seize steel and iron against time. After the Party Central Committee proposed that steel production should be doubled compared to last year, employees of many factories immediately held mobilization rallies and took emergency measures. Due to the day and night attacks of hundreds of thousands of steel workers in Anshan, the steel capital, the production situation has rapidly improved day by day since September. In the ten days of early September, the average daily steel production has increased by 5.4% compared to August, and in the three days from the 8th to the 10th, the daily output has increased by 8.5% compared to the first seven days of the month. In order to ensure faster steel production, the open hearth maintenance workers of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant repaired the open hearths in the face of high heat, creating a new record of more than forty-one hours of rapid furnace repair. All steel plants in Chongqing established combat headquarters, and leading cadres went deep into the workshops to participate in labor with the workers. In Taiyuan, the employees of the famous Youth Iron Smelting Blast Furnace also reorganized their ranks. They nursed the furnace like nurses, carried out safe production, and achieved a new achievement of an average furnace utilization coefficient of 0.465 in the ten days from September 1st to 10th.

In various provinces and regions, the mass movement to vigorously grasp steel is even more grand. Many provinces and regions have mobilized hundreds of thousands or millions of laborers to fight day and night on various fronts such as mining, coal mining, smelting, and transportation, and have adopted a multi-pronged approach to vigorously develop steel. Once the broad masses are mobilized, not only have many areas been transformed into steel towns with blooming steel flowers and flowing molten iron, but also new leaps have occurred in steel construction. According to incomplete statistics, in the ten days of early September alone, more than 110,000 various native blast furnaces have been built across the country, of which more than 20,000 have been put into production.

In the tense battle for steel, the main leading personnel of the local CCP committees personally took command and went to the furnace to lead production. "The secretary sleeps by the furnace, and one furnace lights up ten thousand furnaces," which is the latest characteristic that has emerged on the national steel industry front. Many county party secretaries have now learned iron smelting technology, and some "secretary furnaces" have appeared in various places. The first secretaries of party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province personally led teams to the mountains to smelt iron. With the spirit of "guarding the furnace to sleep and accompanying the furnace to eat," they studied operating techniques day and night with the workers, broke through the iron smelting technical barriers, and by the 10th, nearly a thousand native furnaces in the province were able to carry out normal production. Because the entire party has taken action and strengthened leadership, the enthusiasm of the masses in various places for steelmaking and iron smelting is getting higher and higher. Jiangsu Province has recently been hit by typhoons and rainstorms, and most of the native furnaces are built in the open air. The employees still insisted on production in the wind and rain. In Fujian Province, which is located on the front line, the number of people invested in the steel battle has increased to 524,000, and the daily output of steel and pig iron in early September has increased by more than double compared to August. Even in the Xinjiang region on the northwestern border of the motherland, steel production has also increased significantly in early September. In the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, there are currently 22,000 people involved in the battle for steel and iron.

The great leap forward in national steel production in early September is encouraging, but the steel production task for the entire month of September is still very heavy, and the time is tight; in order to comprehensively overfulfill the steel production task for September, the employees of the national steel front must make even more arduous efforts.

### 九月上旬钢铁日日猛增

    白天：车水马龙为钢铁元帅输送粮饷
    夜晚：万山灯火为铁水奔流彻夜不眠
    二千万大军为1070万吨钢日夜奋战
    九月上旬钢铁日日猛增
    前五天，钢的日产量比上月增长4％，铁增长14％；后五天，钢增长到12.8％，铁上升到38％
    新华社13日讯　本社记者报道：“白天，大道小径车水马龙，为钢铁元帅运‘粮饷’的人们络绎不绝；夜晚，万山灯火辉煌，成千上万的人为钢铁彻夜奋战。”——这是本社驻陕西记者昨夜来长途电话描述的、陕西省全党全民为钢铁而战的情景；其实，这也就是目前全国整个钢铁工业战线上的写照。
    党中央为生产一千零七十万吨钢的庄严号召发布以后，在9月的头十天里，全国各地立即以排山倒海之势，迅速组织了强大的钢铁大军，据不完全的统计，目前全国有两千多万人正在钢铁生产战线上日夜苦战着。
    据冶金工业部的统计，在9月1日到10日的十天里，全国钢的平均日产量比8月份增长了8.8％，生铁增长了18.5％。钢和生铁的日产量，在这一旬里也在逐日上升。9月1日至5日的五天中，钢的日产量平均比8月份增长4％，铁的日产量增长14％；而在后五天中，钢的增长率达到了12.8％，铁也急速上升到38％。随着钢铁产量的迅速增长，一些过去产量很低甚至不产一吨钢铁的地区，已经插上了钢铁丰产的红旗。湖南省在9月份的前五天，全省平均每天只产生铁一千一百吨，10日一天跃到了三千二百七十三吨；贵州省10日一天的生铁产量达到二千二百十七吨，比9月份前五天的平均日产量增长了两倍多，全省生铁年产量计划已经完成了88.5％。到10日为止，生铁达到日产千吨以上的还有河南、四川、山西三个省。
    担负着全国绝大部分钢产量任务的十几个重点钢铁企业的职工，走在全民性的向时间要钢要铁的最前列。许多工厂的职工在党中央提出钢产量要比去年翻一番的号召后，立即举行了誓师大会，采取了紧急措施。钢都鞍山由于十几万钢铁大军的昼夜猛攻，9月份以来生产情况逐日迅速好转。9月上旬的十天中，钢的平均日产量已比8月份提高了5.4％，而在8日到10日的三天中，日产量又比上旬头七天提高了8.5％。上海第三钢铁厂的平炉检修工人，为了保证更快出钢，冒着高热检修平炉，创造了四十一小时多的快速修炉新纪录。重庆市各钢铁厂都成立了战斗指挥部，领导干部深入车间同工人一起参加劳动。在太原，著名的青年炼铁高炉的职工也在重整旗鼓，他们像护士一样护理着炉子，进行安全生产，在9月1日至10日的十天中，达到了高炉平均利用系数零点四六五的新成就。
    在各省区，群众性的大抓钢铁的运动声势更加浩大。很多省区都动员了几十万或上百万的劳动力，日夜战斗在采矿、挖煤、冶炼、运输等各个战线上，采取数管齐下的办法大兴钢铁。广大群众一经发动起来，不但使许多地区变成了钢花怒放铁水奔流的钢铁之乡，在钢铁建设方面也出现了新的跃进。据不完全统计，全国仅在9月上旬的十天中，就建成了各种土高炉十一万多座，其中有两万多座已投入生产。
    在紧张的钢铁战斗中，各地中共党委主要领导人员都亲自挂帅，到炉边去领导生产。“书记睡到炉边去，一炉升火万炉红”，这是全国钢铁工业战线上出现的最新的特色。现在已经有很多县委书记学会了炼铁技术，各地都出现了一些“书记炉”。河北省各级党组织的第一书记亲自带队上山炼铁，他们以“守炉眠，伴炉餐”的干劲，夜以继日地同工人一起研究操作技术，突破了炼铁技术关，到10日止全省已有近千座土炉能够正常进行生产。由于全党动手，加强了领导，各地群众炼钢炼铁的干劲，越来越高。江苏省近日来连遭台风暴雨的侵袭，大部土炉都建在露天，职工们在风雨中仍然坚持生产。地处前线的福建省，投入钢铁战线的人数已经增加到五十二万四千多人，9月上旬钢和生铁的日产量都比8月份增长一倍多。即使在祖国西北边疆的新疆地区，钢铁产量在9月上旬也有了显著的增长。在天山南北，目前已有二万二千多人投入了要钢要铁的战斗。
    全国钢铁生产9月上旬的大跃进形势是令人鼓舞的，但是整个9月份的钢铁生产任务还很繁重，而且时间紧迫；要全面超额完成9月份的钢铁生产任务，全国钢铁战线职工还要作更艰苦的努力。（附图片）
