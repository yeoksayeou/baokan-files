　　New Road for Mathematics to Connect with Reality
    Peking University Mathematics Department Students Solve Production Problems in Factories to Improve Learning Quality

    (Our Dispatch) The question of whether mathematics can connect with reality was debated by many teachers and students in the Mathematics Department of Wuhan University, who theoretically defeated the opposition. Now, the young teachers and students of the Mathematics Department of Peking University have practically pioneered a new path for China's mathematics to connect with reality and for the development of mathematical science.

    Facts Refute the Opposition
    At the end of July, young teachers and students from the Mathematics Department of Peking University left the campus and contacted various factories and enterprises, using mathematics to solve more than 50 major technical key problems, making a preliminary contribution to the country's production and construction. In the Three Gorges large-scale dam concrete pouring project, according to internationally accepted methods, after pouring every three meters high and square, it is necessary to stop for four or five days to wait for the thermal stress changes in the reinforced concrete to stabilize, and then continue pouring upwards, which would greatly prolong the construction period. Now, the young teachers and students of the Mathematics Department of Peking University, using differential equation calculations, have proposed reducing the number of pauses required due to changes in thermal stress during the concrete pouring process, thereby greatly accelerating the progress of the project. Currently, most of China's weather forecasts are based on observational experience and weather maps. Young teachers and students from the Mathematics Department of Peking University, in cooperation with teachers and students majoring in meteorology, have studied a plan to use differential equation calculations to conduct medium- and long-term weather forecasts. The production of high-quality yarn in many cotton mills across the country has been abnormal. After conducting research at the Beijing Cotton Textile United Factory, the young people of the Mathematics Department of Peking University have also used operations research calculations to find the law of controlling the production of high-quality 21-count yarn, and are currently studying the law of producing high-quality 40-count yarn. The young teachers and students of the Mathematics Department of Peking University have also used probability, statistics, operations research, etc. to change the national petroleum transportation routes, the coal transportation routes in Northeast China, and the product inspection methods of the North China Radio Equipment Factory, which can save a lot of funds for the country.

    Go Deep into Reality and Take the Masses as Teachers
    The achievements made by the young teachers and students of the Mathematics Department of Peking University once again prove that the Party's policy of linking theory with practice is fully applicable to the discipline of mathematics. In May and June of this year, the Mathematics Department of Peking University also held debates on the question of whether mathematics should be linked with practice. As a result of the debate, most people verbally agreed to link with practice, but when it came to specific practice, the old teachers said that the domestic industrial level was low and there was nothing that needed to be solved with mathematics. At the end of July, the Party General Branch of the Mathematics Department mobilized more than 100 young teachers and students to go to more than 100 units such as the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the Ministry of Railways, the Water Conservancy Research Institute, and the Beijing Cotton Textile United Factory to collect problems. In the first few days, the staff of factories and enterprises did not understand which problems could be solved with mathematics. Therefore, after these young teachers and students visited them, they did not find any problems. The old teachers in the department who opposed linking theory with practice thought that their line had won and were prematurely happy. An old teacher who originally participated in this work with a half-believing attitude also returned to his study and announced that he would not go out again. The Party General Branch of the department led these young teachers and students to check the investigation methods and asked the teachers and students to go deep into production, and then select the problems that could be solved with mathematics as the focus of research. Once their investigation methods changed, they brought back a large number of problems that could be solved with mathematics that day.

    After seeing these problems, the old teachers who opposed linking with reality said: These problems are too simple and are just odd jobs. In fact, the calculations required for many problems exceeded the content in the books. These old teachers usually felt that solving differential equations with five unknowns was extremely complicated, but now, to solve the problem of heat stress distribution in the Three Gorges Dam, it is necessary to solve more than 200 unknowns. The complexity of the problem is not only that, it also requires understanding the professional knowledge of various industries. This is a great difficulty for young people who only specialize in mathematics. The Party General Branch of the department organized everyone to take workers as teachers. The ten people who studied high-quality yarn in the cotton mill worked with the workers to learn production knowledge in the labor process. After they formulated a plan, they asked the workers for their opinions. As a result, this major key problem in cotton production was completed in half a month.

    Unwilling to Learn According to the Old Method Anymore
    When these young teachers and students summarized their work of more than 20 days under the leadership of the Party General Branch, some old teachers believed that this approach could be done as a temporary shock task, but could not be regarded as a fundamental way to develop mathematics. Some people also said: This result cannot be published in academic journals, and publishing it will make foreigners look down on us. The teachers and students of the Mathematics Department discussed these issues. The young teachers and students who participated in this work unanimously believed that although the achievements currently made are indeed preliminary from the point of view of developing mathematics and from the contribution to the country's production, the preliminary achievements have confirmed that this method of linking with practice is a bright road to promote the development of mathematics in a faster, better and more economical way. In just over 20 days, contributions have been made to the country's production and construction, and some have also made new creations in mathematical theory. In operations research, linear equation systems with more than 10 to 20 unknowns must be calculated using electronic computers, but these young people have created a set of simple calculation methods that can be calculated by three people in three hours. In the study of differential equations, only the calculations of hyperbolic, elliptical, parabolic, and mixed forms can be solved, but these young people encountered another strange form that does not belong to these four forms when studying weather forecasts, and now they have also studied the method of solving it. More people have discovered many new problems that have not yet been solved after contacting production.

    In the discussion, these young teachers and students also criticized the bourgeois standards for measuring scientific research results. They believe that as a Chinese, the role of his research results in the country's production and construction and the evaluation of the Chinese people should be considered first. Whether or not the capitalist country recognizes it is of little importance to us. Some young people also believe that we should establish such ambition: to create a mathematical discipline with unique Chinese characteristics with our own hands according to the Party's policy.

    After this period of practice, the vast majority of students in the Mathematics Department of Peking University are unwilling to learn according to the outdated old methods, and young teachers are also unwilling to teach according to the method of separating theory from practice. They all require to link with practical production, and move some courses to factories and construction sites, where they can work, study and research at the same time. Now the Party Committee of Peking University has arranged specific plans according to the requirements of the masses.

　　数学联系实际的新道路
    北大数学系学生到工厂解决生产问题提高学习质量
    本报讯　数学能否联系实际的问题，武汉大学数学系的许多师生在辩论中从理论上战胜了反对派；现在北京大学数学系的青年师生又从实践中开辟了我国数学联系实际和数学科学发展的新途径。
    事实驳倒了反对派
    北京大学数学系的青年师生在7月底走出校门和各工厂企业部门联系，运用数学解决了五十多项重大的技术关键问题，对国家的生产建设有了初步贡献。长江三峡大型水坝浇灌混凝土的工程，按照国际上通用的办法，每浇灌三米高见方，就要停顿四、五天等待钢筋混凝土热应力变化稳定，然后再继续向上浇灌，这样工期就要拖得很长。现在北大数学系的青年师生运用微分方程的计算，提出了减少混凝土浇灌过程中因热应力的变化而须要停顿的次数，从而大大加速工程进行的速度。目前，我国的天气预报，多数是通过观测的经验和天气图进行的，北京大学数学系的青年师生和气象专业的师生合作，已研究了运用微分方程组的计算进行中期、长期天气预报的方案。全国不少棉纺厂优级纱的生产一直不正常，北大数学系的青年在北京棉纺织联合厂里进行研究后，也已运用运筹学的计算找到了控制优级二十一支纱的生产规律，最近正在研究优级四十支纱的生产规律。北大数学系的青年师生还运用概率学、统计学、运筹学等改变了全国石油运输线路、东北地区的煤炭运输线路以及华北无线电器材厂的产品检验办法，可以为国家节约大量的资金。
    深入实际拜群众为师
    北京大学数学系青年师生所取得的这些成绩，再一次证明党的理论联系实际的方针在数学这门学科里也是完全适用的。今年5、6月间北京大学数学系里也曾就数学要不要联系实际的问题进行过辩论，辩论结果多数人在口头上赞成联系实际，但一谈到具体实践时，老教师却又说国内工业水平低，没有什么须要用数学解决的问题。7月底数学系党总支发动了一百多青年教师和学生到石油工业部、铁道部、水利科学研究院、北京市棉纺织联合厂等一百多个单位去搜集问题，最初几天，工厂企业部门的工作人员不了解哪些问题可以用数学解决，因此，这些青年师生访问他们以后，没有找到什么问题。系里那些反对理论联系实际的老教师以为自己的路线得胜了，过早的高兴了一番。原来抱着半信半疑的态度参加这项工作的一位老教师，这时也回到书斋里宣布再不出去了。系党总支领导这些青年师生检查了调查方法，要求师生们深入到生产中去，然后选择其中可以用数学解决的问题作重点研究。他们的调查方法一改变，当天就带回了大批可以用数学解决的问题。
    反对联系实际的老教师们看到这些问题后又说：这些问题太简单，是打杂的活儿。实际上许多问题所需要的计算都超过了书本上的内容。这些老教师平时教学生微分方程解五个未知数就觉得复杂到顶点了，而现在解决三峡水坝热应力分布问题，须要解二百多个未知数。问题的复杂性还不仅如此，它还要求懂得各行的专业知识。这对仅仅专攻数学的青年来说是个很大的困难。系党总支组织大家拜工人为师。在棉纺厂研究优级纱的十个人，就和工人们一起劳动，在劳动中学习生产知识，他们制订出了方案后，又请工人提意见。结果半个月就完成了这项棉纺生产上的重大关键问题。
    不愿按老方法学下去了
    当他们这些青年师生在党总支领导下对二十多天的工作进行总结时，一些老教师又认为这种做法作为临时突击任务是可以行的，但不能看成是发展数学的根本道路。有的人还说：这种结果不能登学报，登了以后会使外国人看不起。数学系的师生就这些问题作了讨论。参加这项工作的青年师生们一致认为虽然目前所取得的这些成绩从发展数学的观点、从对国家生产所作的贡献来说，确实是初步的，但从所获得的初步成绩已经可以肯定，这种联系实际的方法是多快好省地推动数学发展的光明大道。仅仅二十多天的时间，就对国家生产建设作出了贡献，而且有的在数学理论上也有了新的创造。运筹学上线行方程组一到二十个以上的未知数就非用电子计算机计算不可，而这些青年人创造了一套简便的计算方法，三个人在三小时内就能算好。微分方程学上只能解双曲、椭圆、抛物、混合四个形态的计算，而这些青年人在研究天气预报时碰到了不属这四个形态的另一种奇形，现在他们也研究出了求解的方法。更多的人在联系生产后，发现了很多尚没有人解决的新问题。
    在讨论中这些青年师生还批判了衡量科学研究成果的资产阶级标准。他们认为作为一个中国人，他的研究成果首先应该看对祖国生产建设起的作用，看祖国人民的评价，资本主义国家承认与否这对我们并无足轻重。有些青年还认为应该树立这样的志气：根据党的方针用自己的双手来创造具有中国独特风格的数学学科。
    经过这一段实践，北大数学系的绝大多数学生都不愿按那套落后了的老办法学习了，青年教师也不愿按照理论脱离实际的办法来教学。他们都要求联系生产实际，把有些课程搬到工厂、工地上去，在那里一边劳动一边学习一边研究。现在北大党委已根据群众的要求在安排具体计划。
