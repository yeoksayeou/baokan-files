Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 27th - Algerian Republic Provisional Government Prime Minister Abbas, at a press conference held here on the 26th, issued a policy statement saying: The Algerian Provisional Government has sworn allegiance to the ideals of freedom, justice, and social liberation. The Provisional Government recognizes its responsibilities and will undertake all of them, the primary responsibility being to lead the people and the army towards national liberation.

Prime Minister Abbas said: "The People's Republic of China's recognition of the Algerian Provisional Government, and other Asian countries following suit, is of great significance."

At this press conference, attended by all ministers of the Algerian Republic Provisional Government in Cairo, Prime Minister Abbas condemned the deceptive French referendum on De Gaulle's "constitution," expressed willingness to resolve the Algerian issue through peaceful negotiations, and expressed willingness to participate in a North African federation with Tunisia and Morocco.

In the crowded hall, enthusiastic applause repeatedly greeted the statement made by Abbas.

Abbas pointed out that the fabrication that Algeria belongs to France and the myth that Algeria is one with France have no other basis than a policy of force and violence. He said: "Algeria is not France. The Algerian people are definitely not French. Attempts to make our country a country ruled by the French constitute an transgression and an adventure condemned by the United Nations Charter as an anachronistic and criminal undertaking; forcing Algerians to participate in a referendum that is purely about the French system is an intolerable provocation to the Algerian people who have been rightly fighting for their national independence for four years."

He said that the Algerian people will never lay down their arms unless their rights as an autonomous people are recognized. Algeria is no longer isolated in this struggle; it has first and foremost received the support of Tunisia and Morocco. He also said: The Algerian people are part of the Arab world. No one can harm Arabs in Algiers, Cairo, and Baghdad, while pretending to be friends of the Arabs in Tunis, Rabat, and Beirut.

He also expressed his gratitude to all the countries participating in the Bandung Conference for their material and moral support and assured them that Algeria is loyal to the principles of the Bandung Conference.

Abbas said that Algerians are not the enemies of the French people. He said: "We have always stated that we are willing to resolve the Algerian issue peacefully through negotiations." He said: "The reason for prolonging the war is entirely due to the persistent refusal of successive French governments to negotiate."

He said: "The Algerian Republic Provisional Government is willing to hold negotiations. Therefore, it is prepared to meet with representatives of the French government at any time."

Prime Minister Abbas announced that the Provisional Government assumes its international responsibilities, that it will respect the principles of the United Nations Charter and abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

He said that the Provisional Government would welcome any international initiative aimed at applying the humanitarian provisions of the Geneva Conventions to the Algerian war. He would welcome any initiative to consolidate world peace, halt the arms race, and ban nuclear testing. He revealed that France intends to conduct its nuclear tests on Algerian territory.

He concluded by pointing out that prolonging the Algerian war is a permanent threat to world peace, and he called on the people of all countries to make a joint effort to curb France from carrying out this imperialist war.

    阿巴斯总理发表政策声明
    阿尔及利亚决心为独立斗争到底
    戴高乐的“公民投票”是对阿尔及利亚人民不可容忍的挑衅
    据新华社开罗27日电  阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯26日在这里举行的记者招待会上发表政策声明说：阿尔及利亚临时政府已经宣誓效忠于自由、正义和社会解放的理想。临时政府认识到它的责任，并且将承担它的一切责任，其中首要的责任就是领导人民和军队走向民族解放。
    阿巴斯总理说：“中华人民共和国承认了阿尔及利亚临时政府，其他亚洲国家也将跟着承认阿尔及利亚临时政府，这一点是意义重大的。”
    在这个所有在开罗的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府部长都出席的记者招待会上，阿巴斯总理谴责就戴高乐“宪法”举行欺骗性的法国公民投票，表示愿意通过和平谈判解决阿尔及利亚问题，并且表示愿意同突尼斯和摩洛哥一起参加北非联邦。
    在挤满了人的大厅里，一再响起了欢迎阿巴斯发表的声明的热烈掌声。
    阿巴斯指出，关于阿尔及利亚属于法国这种捏造以及阿尔及利亚同法国是一体的神话是除了武力和暴力的政策之外没有任何其它根据的。他说：“阿尔及利亚并不是法国。阿尔及利亚人民绝不是法国人。企图使我国成为法国人所统治的国家构成一种越轨的行为和一种联合国宪章所谴责的成为时代错误的和犯罪的冒险事业；迫使阿尔及利亚人参加纯粹是关于法国的制度的公民投票是对于四年来正确地为了自己的民族独立而进行斗争的阿尔及利亚人民的不可容忍的挑衅”。
    他说，阿尔及利亚人民决不放下武器，除非他们作为自主的人民的权力得到承认。阿尔及利亚在这一斗争中不再是孤立的，它首先受到了突尼斯和摩洛哥的支持。他还说：阿尔及利亚人民是阿拉伯世界的一部分。谁都不能在阿尔及尔、开罗和巴格达损害阿拉伯人，而在突尼斯、拉巴特和贝鲁特假装是阿拉伯人的朋友。
    他还表示感谢参加万隆会议的所有国家给予的物质上和道义上的支持，并且向它们保证，阿尔及利亚忠于万隆会议的原则。
    阿巴斯说，阿尔及利亚人并不是法国人民的敌人。他说：“我们一向声明我们愿意通过谈判和平解决阿尔及利亚问题”。他说：“使战争拖长的原因完全是由于历届法国政府顽固地拒绝谈判”。
    他说：“阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府方面愿意举行谈判。因此，它准备在任何时候会见法国政府的代表。”
    阿巴斯总理宣布，临时政府承担它在国际方面的责任，它将尊重联合国宪章的原则，遵守世界人权宣言。
    他说，临时政府将欢迎任何目的在于把日内瓦公约关于人道主义的规定应用到阿尔及利亚战争上的国际倡议。他将欢迎任何巩固世界和平、停止军备竞赛和禁止核试验的倡议。他揭露，法国打算到阿尔及利亚的领土上去进行它的核试验。
    他最后指出，延长阿尔及利亚战争是对世界和平的永久的威胁，他呼吁各国人民共同作出努力，以便遏止法国进行这一帝国主义战争。
