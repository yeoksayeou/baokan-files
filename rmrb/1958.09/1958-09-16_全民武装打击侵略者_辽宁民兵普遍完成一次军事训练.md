Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 14th: The cities and vast rural areas of Liaoning Province are intensifying military training, ready at any time to deal a fatal blow to the invaders. The vast rural militia of the province has universally completed one military training session, achieving significant results. In the steel capital of Anshan, as well as cities like Shenyang and Lushun-Dalian, the militia are also stepping up training and military exercises. Workers, farmers, and intellectuals in Lushun-Dalian have rapidly armed themselves, and large numbers of militia divisions, militia regiments, and worker armed forces are simultaneously engaged in production and military training. Changhai County, where the entire island is militarized, has completed the first exercise of rifle live-fire shooting, with female militia member Fu Jizhi achieving excellent results in live-fire shooting. Nearly 100,000 young workers, students, and government cadres in Lushun-Dalian also recently participated in military camping training and other military subjects. The Liaoning University militia reserve division and the militia of the Northeastern Institute of Technology in Shenyang swore that they would not only be good students but also good soldiers defending and building the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, September 14th: Upon hearing Premier Zhou’s statement, the more than one million militia established in the vast rural areas of Jilin Province immediately began training day and night, determined to complete the three-year training task in just a few months. Dozens of railway, highway, and water conservancy construction sites and factories and mines with over a thousand people in the province's rural areas have formed militia regiments and militia divisions, building roads and producing during the day, and training in the morning and evening. The more than 10,000 migrant workers at the Yantongshan Railway construction site in Panshi County have already established a militia division; Yanji County in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture has established a road-building "military training regiment"; Lishu and Yongji Counties have established several water conservancy militia regiments. Male and female commune members in Yongji, Shuangyang, Jiutai, and other counties have also taken up arms, ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time.
Most of the province's cities have achieved preliminary militarization, and the majority of workers and suburban farmers have taken up arms and begun training.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 14th: The mass arming movement in Henan Province is progressing rapidly, with most villages, cities, factories, shops, schools, and government offices in the province armed. A tense military training upsurge is currently underway.

The rural areas of Henan, which have already realized people's communes, are arranging production and life according to the principles of "organizational militarization," "production combatization," and "life collectivization." Currently, young and middle-aged commune members are studying basic military knowledge and undergoing basic military training on a regular basis every day.

The vast number of young and middle-aged women in Henan Province are also not to be outdone, and they have taken the initiative to organize themselves to participate in military training. There are 2,900 female militia members in the Chaoying People's Commune. The suburban People's Commune of Zhengzhou established a Red Flag Women's Company, and hundreds of female workers at the Zhengzhou No. 2 State Cotton Mill established a Women's Battalion, learning military techniques such as grenade throwing, shooting, and motorcycle driving. Recently, forty-two key female militia members of the Xinxin People's Commune in Yanshi County held a shooting test, and thirty-two of them achieved excellent results.

In addition, many factories, government offices, schools, shops, and streets across the province have recently established armed organizations to conduct military training. All employees of the Zhengzhou Machinery Factory have established a militia backbone regiment and insist on military training every day. The Henan Agricultural College and four surrounding natural villages jointly established a militia division.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 14th: The upsurge of arming the entire people is flourishing in Hunan Province. Workers standing on the front lines of steel, machinery, metallurgy, transportation, and other industries are establishing worker backbone self-defense forces one after another. The vast number of farmers who are vigorously engaged in autumn production and establishing people's communes, with the original four million militia as the backbone, the upsurge of arming the entire people is spreading throughout villages and communes. In Lianyuan County, 47,000 people requested to participate in training at one time. In the mass training in Linxiang County, it was proposed: "Learn formation during work, and the road is the training ground," "Everyone learns to shoot, preparing to fight the American imperialists." More than 100 members of the Wuxing Cooperative in Zhongfang Township practiced on the beach at night. The militia battalion of the Gaotang People's Commune in Changsha County made three resolutions: First, resolutely support Premier Zhou's statement; second, do a good job in military training, strengthen public security and defense work, and strictly control landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements; third, call on the entire battalion of militia to conduct thorough combat mobilization, and ensure that the entire battalion and company will go to the front line once the motherland calls.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, September 14th: Angered by the military provocations and threats of war by U.S. imperialism, the more than 19 million people of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have formed a labor army of more than 3 million people, combining industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and have achieved universal arming of the people throughout the region in recent days.

This reserve force of the national defense army, rapidly organized in the anger against aggression, is a large army combining labor and military affairs with multiple arms. The 1.01 million-strong "Steel Field Army" is distributed across more than 20,000 large and small blast furnaces, steelmaking furnaces, and countless mines throughout the region, producing and training at the same time. A "Field Division" in Zhaoping County is busy rushing to repair the Mengshan-Zhaoping Highway. The "Railway Corps" of Luzhai County is active on the line construction site. Water conservancy construction sites and artificial lakes have become labor and training grounds for the "Navy." The "Cavalry" company of the Guiping Tiantang People's Commune is actively conducting cavalry training, taking advantage of the early morning and the empty return after transporting goods.
