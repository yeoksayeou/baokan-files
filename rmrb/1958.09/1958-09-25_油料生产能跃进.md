    Oil Production Can Leap Forward
    Like grain production, this year's oil production has also made a great leap forward. According to preliminary estimates by the Ministry of Agriculture, most oil crops can increase production by 80-90% to one or two times, respectively.
    Next year, oil production can have an even greater leap forward. Taking peanuts as an example, if the average yield per mu next year reaches one-tenth of the "satellite" field yield, the total output will greatly increase.
    However, even as news of abundant harvests frequently arrives, some people still insist that oil crops are low-yield crops. This is a harmful view. Because of the existence of this view, the phenomenon of not paying attention to oil crops is bound to occur. Therefore, we must repeatedly criticize the low-yield theory, clear away this influence, in order to develop oil production more quickly. Another reason for neglecting oil production is that some people grasp one end and lose the other, only paying attention to grain production and not paying attention to the production of oil crops. This is because they do not understand that oil has the same important role as grain in meeting the needs of industrial construction and people's lives. Grain and oil are not only not contradictory, but complement each other.
    It is now the rapeseed sowing season. Doing a good job in planting rapeseed, which accounts for 30% of the area of oil crops, is an important key to achieving a great leap forward in oil production next year.

### 油料生产能跃进

    油料生产能跃进
    同粮食生产一样，今年的油料生产也有很大的跃进。据农业部初步估计：大部分油料都可以分别增产八、九成到一两倍。
    明年，油料生产还能有更大的跃进。以花生来说，如果明年的平均亩产量达到“卫星”田产量的十分之一，总产量就会有很大的增长。
    但是，就在这丰收喜讯频传的时候，有些人还是坚持说油料是低产作物。这是一种有害的观点。由于这种观点的存在，势必发生不重视油料作物的现象。所以我们要一再批判低产论，扫清这种影响，以便更快地发展油料生产。轻视油料生产的另一原因，是有些人抓住一头，丢掉一头，只注意粮食生产，不注意油料作物的生产。这因为他们不了解油料对于满足工业建设和人民生活的需要和粮食有同等重大作用。粮食和油料两者不仅不矛盾，而且相得益彰。
    目前已是油菜播种时期，把占油料作物面积30％的油菜种好，是实现明年油料生产大跃进的重要一关。
