Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 19th: The workers of the Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, who are advancing under the red flag of high production in open hearth furnaces nationwide, successively created six new fast steelmaking records from the 14th to the 16th. In three days, the average daily steel production per square meter of furnace bottom reached 17.162 tons, which is 2.937 tons higher than the 14.225 tons in August, continuing to lead the country. On the 18th, the workers in this workshop successively created three new fast steelmaking records in one day. The utilization coefficient reached 21.2 tons, producing 145 tons of steel more than planned. They have taken another step forward.

When the news that this workshop was holding high the red flag of high steel production was published in the People's Daily on the 11th, the workers were very excited. Workshop cadres held a meeting late into the night to study and decided to adopt six major measures, including expanding furnace output and ensuring the normal supply of gas, to plant the red flag on an even higher peak. The next day, the output of each furnace of steel immediately increased from 28 tons to 32 tons. They also broke the conventional practice of increasing the heat load only after smelting fifty furnaces of steel after furnace repair. From the fourth furnace onwards, they boldly and carefully increased the amount of gas and air, shortening the steelmaking time.

In these few days, the red flag for excellence in fast steelmaking fluttered between the two open hearth furnaces. The group led by the veteran Sun Wanyin successively created new records of smelting a furnace of steel in three hours and fifty-three minutes and three hours and forty-six minutes on the 14th and 15th. Immediately afterwards, the two groups of Wei Xianrong and Li Peiying broke Sun Wanyin's group's record in a shorter time, with the new record of three hours and thirty minutes for smelting a furnace of steel created by Li Peiying's group being the highest. Four of the six new records created by the two open hearth furnaces in three days appeared on the 16th. The utilization coefficient on this day reached 18.703 tons.

Only one day later, these records were replaced by even higher records. The Han Xinliang group on the No. 1 open hearth furnace only spent three hours and thirty-eight minutes to smelt a furnace of steel yesterday, which is higher than the record he created on the 16th. On the No. 2 open hearth furnace, the Li Peiying group, which had not created a new record in August, shortened the time to three hours and twenty-four minutes yesterday after exceeding the other two groups with a record of three hours and thirty minutes on the 16th. The creator of the highest new record yesterday was again the group led by the veteran steelmaker Sun Wanyin, with a time of three hours and fourteen minutes. The average smelting time for each furnace of steel in the entire workshop yesterday was three hours and fifty-seven minutes, which is one hour and three minutes shorter than the average in the first ten days of this month. From the 13th, when both open hearth furnaces were fully repaired, to the 18th, this workshop produced 242 tons of steel more than planned in six days.

People's Daily, Lushun-Dalian, September 19th: In the intense fast steelmaking competition, the steelworkers of the Dalian Steel Plant created a new national record of 51.2 for the electric furnace utilization coefficient (the tonnage of steel produced by the electric furnace transformer per million volt-amperes per day) on the 17th, taking a big step to the forefront of electric furnace steelmaking in the world.

In July and August, the electric furnace utilization coefficient of the Dalian Steel Plant ranked first among electric furnace steelmaking plants in the country. The news that the newspaper published their national record-breaking achievements greatly encouraged all the steelworkers. The entire plant launched a battle for a high-yield month in September and formulated a "satellite operation plan," determined to plant the red flag even higher. The entire steelmaking workshop broke the boundaries between furnaces, groups, and shifts. The workers ran back and forth non-stop, sweating profusely, and doing their best to support others. The factory director, party committee secretary, and engineering technicians all worked tirelessly through the night, fighting alongside the steelworkers by the scorching furnace. As a result, yesterday's highest daily output record was 79% higher than the average daily output in August and 55.3% higher than the average daily output in the first half of September.

    炼钢工人乘胜猛进
    上钢三厂四天九创快速炼钢新纪录
    大连钢厂又在世界前列迈出一大步
    据新华社上海19日电　高举全国平炉高产红旗前进的上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间职工，在14日到16日又接连创造了六次快速炼钢新纪录，三天内平均每天每平方公尺炉底一昼夜的产钢量高达十七点一六二吨，比8月份的十四点二二五吨高出了二点九三七吨，继续在全国领先。18日一天内，这个车间的工人又连续创造了三个快速炼钢新纪录。利用系数高达二十一·二吨，比计划多生产了一百四十五吨钢。百尺竿头又进了一步。
    当人民日报11日刊载这个车间高举炼钢高产红旗的消息传到炼钢炉前的时候，工人们非常激动。车间干部漏夜开会研究，决定采取扩大炉产量，保证煤气正常供应等六大措施，把红旗插上更高峰。第二天，每炉钢的产量立即从二十八吨提高到三十二吨。他们还打破了过去修炉以后炼五十炉钢才能提高热负荷的常规，从第四炉起，就胆大心细地加大了煤气量和空气量，缩短了炼钢时间。
    这几天，快速炼钢优胜红旗在两座平炉之间飘来飘去。老将孙万银所在的小组，在14、15日连续创造三小时五十三分和三小时四十六分炼出一炉钢的新纪录。紧接着，魏贤荣和李佩盈两个小组，以更短的时间打破了孙万银小组的纪录，而以李佩盈小组所创造的三点三十分钟炼一炉钢的新纪录为最高。两座平炉三天内所创造的六次新纪录中，有四次都是在16日一天内出现的。这一天的利用系数，达到了十八点七零三吨。
    只隔一天，这些纪录又被更高的纪录所代替了。一号平炉上的韩忻亮小组，昨天只花了三点三十八分钟就炼出了一炉钢，比他16日创造的纪录要高。二号平炉上，在8月份没有创造过新纪录的李佩盈小组，在16日以三点三十分钟的纪录超过另两个小组以后，昨天又把时间缩短到三点二十四分钟。昨天最高新纪录的创造者，又是炼钢老将孙万银所在的小组，时间是三小时十四分钟。全车间昨天平均每炉钢的冶炼时间是三小时五十七分，比这个月上旬平均缩短了一小时零三分。从13日两座平炉全部修好后，到18日为止，六天内这个车间比计划多生产了二百四十二吨钢。
    本报旅大19日电　大连钢厂的炼钢工人在紧张的快速炼钢竞赛中，在17日又创造了电炉利用系数（电炉的变压器百万伏安一昼夜产钢的吨数）五十一点二的全国最高纪录，它在电炉炼钢的世界前列迈出了一大步。
    大连钢厂7、8月份电炉利用系数居全国电炉炼钢厂的首位。报纸刊登了他们创全国最高纪录的消息，全体炼钢工人们感到很大的鼓舞，全厂开展9月为高产月的战斗，制订了一个“卫星作业计划”，决心把红旗插得更高。整个炼钢车间打破了炉与炉，组与组，班与班之间的界限，工人们来回奔跑不停地挥汗，竭尽全力，支援别人。工厂的厂长、党委书记、工程技术人员都通宵达旦，在灼热的炉旁和炼钢工人并肩苦战。结果，昨天创造的日产量最高纪录，比8月份平均日产量提高了79％，比9月上半月平均日产量提高了55.3％。
