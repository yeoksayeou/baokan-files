　　Six Hundred Million People Mobilize to Crush the Military Threats and War Provocations of the American Aggressors
　　U.S. Secretary of State Dulles issued a statement on September 4, publicly declaring the expansion of U.S. aggression in the Taiwan Strait area, carrying out military provocations and war threats against the Chinese people. At the same time, it was reported that the United States dispatched a large number of warships and aircraft from its own country and the Mediterranean to strengthen the Seventh Fleet operating in the Taiwan Strait area. So far, the Seventh Fleet has seven aircraft carriers, three heavy cruisers, and forty destroyers. The U.S. Forty-sixth Patrol Aviation Squadron, the First Marine Air Wing, and several other batches of aircraft have been transferred to Taiwan and the Philippines. The first batch of 3,800 U.S. Marines has landed in southern Taiwan, and more troops will continue to arrive. The U.S. military command in Taiwan has also openly threatened to blockade our coastal islands and the Jinmen Islands with gunboats and artillery fire in the exercise on the 8th. While the Chinese people are making a great leap forward on the road of socialist construction with selfless labor, American imperialism is trying to impose war on us! The Chinese people love peace, but love of peace does not mean giving up sovereignty and territorial integrity. To maintain sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Chinese people will not hesitate to shed their blood. If the American aggressors have any illusions about this, they are dead wrong!
　　Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of our country, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, solemnly declared: "If the U.S. government disregards the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world, continues to carry out aggression and interference against China, and imposes war on the Chinese people, the U.S. government must bear all the serious consequences arising therefrom." This is a serious warning from 650 million people to the American aggressors! People across the country mobilize to crush the military threats and war provocations of U.S. imperialism!
　　Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have been Chinese territory for many centuries. Jinmen, Matsu, and other coastal islands are even islands within China's territorial waters. As the saying goes, "How can others be allowed to snore beside one's bed?" Liberating these islands and returning them to the embrace of the motherland is the natural right and duty of the Chinese people, and it is entirely China's internal affair, just as the People's Liberation Army liberated Hainan Island, the Zhoushan Islands, and other coastal islands in the past. However, the American aggressors, in order to expand their scope of aggression from Taiwan to Jinmen and Matsu, are trying to create excuses to obliterate the sovereignty of the Chinese people. Dulles said in his statement that Taiwan and the Jinmen and Matsu Islands have "never" been under our jurisdiction, and that any attempt by our people to liberate these islands is a "gross violation of the principles that form the basis of world order, namely: that no country should use armed force to seize new territory." Here, Dulles and Eisenhower are playing the same infamous trick that the American aggressors used in the Middle East, where they described the actions of the Lebanese people demanding the overthrow of the Chamoun government as so-called aggression, and the Iraqi people's revolution to overthrow the monarchy as so-called aggression. Now, he describes the righteous actions of the Chinese people to liberate their own territory as "seizing new territory." It is well known that the U.S. government has signed many documents in the past, declaring that Taiwan, Penghu, and other Chinese islands are Chinese territory, and guaranteeing that the United States will not interfere in China's internal affairs. On January 5, 1950, U.S. President Truman announced: "In the Cairo Declaration of December 1, 1943, the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and the Chairman of China stated their purpose: to have Japan return to China the territories it had stolen from China, such as Taiwan. The United States is a signatory to the Potsdam Proclamation of January 26, 1945. The Potsdam Proclamation stated: The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be implemented immediately. Japan also accepted the provisions of this declaration upon surrender. ... For the past four years, the United States and other allies have also recognized China's exercise of sovereignty over the island; the United States has never had any ambitions to plunder Taiwan or other Chinese territories... The United States also does not intend to use armed forces to intervene in the current situation, and the U.S. government does not intend to follow any path that would involve the United States in China's internal strife." Enough! Hasn't the U.S. government solemnly acknowledged that Taiwan, Jinmen, and Matsu are Chinese territory, and not some new territory of China? The Chinese people demand the liberation of these territories, not from foreigners, but from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang who were thoroughly defeated by the Chinese people and fled under American protection.
　　The reason why the Chinese people have not yet "governed" these regions is precisely because the American aggressors shamefully betrayed the statements made by the U.S. government to the world. If the U.S. government had not carried out armed intervention, wouldn't Jinmen, Matsu, and even Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have been under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China long ago? The arguments that Dulles and Eisenhower found for the U.S. aggression plan are truly laughable and pitiful!
　　Dulles said: "The United States has treaty obligations to help defend Taiwan from armed attack, and the joint resolution of Congress authorizes the President to use U.S. armed forces to secure and protect relevant positions such as Jinmen and Matsu." What treaty obligations? It is the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique on December 2, 1954. This "treaty" is a letter of indenture written by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit who was spurned by the Chinese people, and this "treaty" is also ironclad evidence of U.S. imperialism's occupation of Chinese territory. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which was defeated by the Chinese people and fled to Taiwan, has no right to sign any treaty with any country at all. Therefore, the so-called U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is completely illegal and invalid. The U.S. occupation of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and its attempt to expand this direct aggression to coastal islands such as Jinmen and Matsu, is an illegal act of interfering in our internal affairs and infringing on China's territorial integrity and sovereignty. The United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that the territorial integrity and political independence of any country shall not be violated, and the U.S. aggression is a complete violation of the United Nations Charter and all international legal norms. As for the resolution passed by the U.S. Congress, who gave the U.S. Congress the right to pass such a resolution that violates the United Nations Charter and international legal norms and interferes in the internal affairs of other countries? Is the whole world just a state of the United States? If this so-called resolution authorizing the President to use U.S. armed forces to obstruct our liberation of Jinmen and Matsu has any meaning, it only further confirms the criminal act of U.S. armed interference in China's internal affairs and its war threats. No matter what country's people, they will not recognize that their territory should be occupied by the United States just because the U.S. Congress has made a resolution. Therefore, any so-called "treaty" signed between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and any relevant resolution passed by the U.S. Congress, are completely illegal and invalid in the face of the Chinese people and the people of the world, in the face of the United Nations Charter and international legal norms, and in the face of truth and justice.
　　The current tense situation in the Taiwan Strait area stems from the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism. Since the Chinese people liberated the mainland, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, with the support and instigation of its American masters, has been harassing the mainland and has never stopped. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang occupies Jinmen and Matsu, directly threatening the safety of Xiamen and Fuzhou, and the foreign shipping of these two ports is frequently attacked. Because the United States has assembled a large fleet and aircraft in the Taiwan Strait area, conducting war threats, there has always been a tense situation in this area. Since the United States launched the war of aggression in the Middle East, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, with American support, has intensified its harassment activities from coastal islands such as Jinmen and Matsu, and has repeatedly clamored for "accelerating preparations for a counterattack against the mainland at an opportune moment." As early as more than a month before the People's Liberation Army severely punished the Chiang bandit army in Jinmen, the Chiang Kai-shek clique canceled the holidays of officers and soldiers and actively prepared for war. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's aircraft intensified their attacks on the mainland, and their ships intensified their activities in the coastal areas. It is precisely for this reason that the People's Liberation Army gave a heavy blow to the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on the coastal islands. This is entirely a matter within the scope of the internal affairs of the Chinese government. However, after the U.S. aggressors were condemned by the world for their aggression in the Middle East, in order to divert the attention of the people of the world and delay the withdrawal of their troops from Lebanon, they blatantly assembled armed forces in the Taiwan Strait area, openly carried on military provocations and war threats against the Chinese people, and wanted to expand the scope of their aggression in the Taiwan area to coastal islands such as Jinmen and Matsu. This action of the United States is a serious provocation to the 600 million Chinese people and a serious threat to world peace.
　　However, the American aggressors should remember that the Chinese people's determination to liberate their own territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands is unshakable. No war provocation by the U.S. can scare the Chinese people. On the contrary, it will only arouse greater anger from the 600 million people. When American imperialism supported the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in 1946, launched a full-scale civil war, and forced the war onto the Chinese people, the Chinese people were not intimidated, but under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they rose up to meet the challenge, until they eliminated four million Chiang gang regular troops fully equipped with American equipment, and drove the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, together with its master, the American imperialists, into the sea. In the autumn of 1950, the United States, under the blue flag of the United Nations, gathered the armies of sixteen countries and, disregarding the warnings of the Chinese people, crossed the 38th parallel in Korea and invaded our border, and sent a large number of aircraft to invade our Northeast airspace, bombing and strafing, hitting the Yalu River. Contrary to what Dulles said in his statement, it was by no means China using armed forces in Korea to realize its "territorial ambitions," but precisely the American aggressors attempting to use armed forces to realize its "territorial ambitions" not only in Korea, but also in China. When American imperialism forced the war on us, our people sent the Chinese People's Volunteers to work with the Korean people to crush the American aggressors' arrogant plan to first occupy Korea and then conquer China. Don't Dulles and his ilk think that the lessons the Chinese people gave to the American aggressors were not enough? Although the Chinese people love peace, if the forgetful American imperialists insist on armed interference in our internal affairs and insist on competing with the Chinese people, then we Chinese people will not fail to understand the principle of reciprocity. Our people will certainly rise up in self-defense, resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate the aggressors.
　　The United States is creating tension in the Taiwan area of our country, making the clouds of war appear in the East, which once again exposes the ferocious face of U.S. imperialism to the people of the world. The just struggle of the Chinese people has received strong support from the people of all countries. A commentator for the Soviet newspaper Pravda pointed out: "The Soviet people, who have fraternal friendship and mutual assistance relations with the People's Republic of China, will use all means to assist their brothers, the Chinese people, to restrain the shameless, reckless adventurers—the instigators of war."
　　The newspapers of Vietnam, Korea, Mongolia, Czechoslovakia, Albania, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Democratic Germany have also successively published commentaries, severely condemning the American imperialists for occupying Taiwan and provoking People's China, and supporting the Chinese people's struggle against the American aggressors.
　　President Nasser of the United Arab Republic said: "When the Chinese people want to realize their aspirations and retain all their territories, imperialist military intervention occurs. The real intervention is the occupation of Taiwan."
　　The Cairo "Evening News" said: "Supporting China is supporting our own cause, and it is also supporting the victory of the forces of peace over war and the victory of the forces of the people over imperialism." Sundarlal, President of the India-China Friendship Association, said: "Let American imperialism understand the signs of an imminent crisis. Let them realize that India, all Arab countries, the Soviet Union and socialist countries, truth and justice are on China's side."
　　The Chinese people, who have been tempered by long-term revolutionary struggles, cannot be intimidated or deceived. The Chinese people have every right to take all appropriate methods, at the appropriate time, to liberate their own territory, and will not allow any foreign interference. When American imperialism has deployed troops in the Taiwan Strait and is carrying out serious war provocations against the Chinese people, the Chinese people must immediately mobilize and fight to the end to crush any provocations by the American aggressors! The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the countries and vast people in Asia and Africa who maintain peace and oppose aggression, and all the people in the world who oppose aggression and love peace, are standing with us. Let the provocations of American imperialism, under the joint counterattack of the Chinese people and the people of the world, suffer another complete defeat!

　　六亿人民动员起来，粉碎美国侵略者的军事威胁和战争挑衅
    美国国务卿杜勒斯于9月4日发表声明，公言要扩大美国在台湾海峡地区的侵略范围，对中国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。与此同时，据报道，美国从本国和地中海调派了大批军舰、飞机，加强了在台湾海峡地区活动的第七舰队。到目前为止，第七舰队已有航空母舰七艘，重巡洋舰三艘，驱逐舰四十艘。美国第四十六巡逻航空队、第一个海军陆战队航空队，和其他好几批飞机，调到台湾、菲律宾。美国第一批海军陆战队三千八百人已在台湾南部登陆，还有部队将继续到达。侵台美军司令部还公然扬言，要在8日的演习中以炮舰和炮火封锁我沿海岛屿和金门岛群。当中国人民正在以忘我劳动，在社会主义建设的道路上大跃进的时候，美帝国主义却妄想把战争强加在我们头上！中国人民是热爱和平的，但是，热爱和平决不是可以放弃主权和领土完整，为了保持主权和领土完整，中国人民决不吝惜自己的鲜血。如果美国侵略者在这个问题上有任何的幻想，那他们就是大错特错了！
    我国国务院周恩来总理代表中华人民共和国政府郑重声明：“如果美国政府悍然不顾中国人民的再三警告和世界人民的和平愿望，继续对中国进行侵略和干涉，把战争强加在中国人民的头上，美国政府必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。”这是六亿五千万人民对美国侵略者的严重警告！全国人民动员起来，粉碎美帝国主义的军事威胁和战争挑衅！
    台湾和澎湖列岛好多世纪以来就是中国的领土。金门、马祖等沿海岛屿更是属于中国大陆领海以内的岛屿。古语说：“卧榻之侧，岂容他人鼾睡。”解放这些岛屿，使之重归祖国的怀抱，是中国人民天经地义的权利和义务，完全属于中国的内政，正如我国人民解放军过去解放海南岛、舟山群岛和其他沿海岛屿一样。但是，美国侵略者为了把自己的侵略范围从台湾扩大到金门、马祖，竟然想制造借口，抹煞中国人民的主权。杜勒斯在他的声明中说什么台湾和金门及马祖各岛“从来没有”属于我国的管辖之下，并且说什么我国人民要解放这些岛屿的任何尝试都是“粗暴地破坏作为世界秩序基础的原则，即：任何国家不应使用武装力量来夺取新的领土”。杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔在这里玩弄了美国侵略者在中东的同样臭名昭著的借口，在那里他们把黎巴嫩人民要求推翻夏蒙政府的行动说成是所谓侵略，把伊拉克人民推翻王朝的革命也说成是所谓侵略，现在，他又把中国人民解放自己领土的正义行动说成是“夺取新的领土”。举世周知，美国政府过去签署的许多文件，曾经声明：台湾、澎湖及中国其他岛屿是中国领土，保证美国不干涉中国内政。1950年1月5日美国总统杜鲁门曾经宣布：“在1943年12月1日的开罗宣言中美国总统、英国首相、中国主席曾申明他们的目的是：使日本所窃取于中国的领土，如台湾，归还中国。美国是1945年1月26日波茨坦公告的签字国。波茨坦公告称：开罗宣言条款应即执行。日本投降时亦曾接受此宣言的规定。……过去四年来，美国及其他盟国亦承认中国对该岛行使主权；美国对台湾或中国其他领土从无掠夺的野心……美国亦不拟使用武装部队干预其现在的局势，美国政府不拟遵循任何足以把美国卷入中国内争中的途径。”够了！美国政府不是已经郑重其事地承认了台湾、金门和马祖是中国的领土，而不是什么中国的新的领土吗？中国人民要求解放这些自己的领土，不是从外国人手里解放，而是从被中国人民彻底打败、在美国保护下逃跑的蒋介石残余匪帮的统治下解放。
　　中国人民之所以还没有“管辖”这些地区，正是罪在美国侵略者可耻地背弃了美国政府自己向全世界发出的声明。如果不是美国政府进行了武装干涉，不但金门、马祖，而且台湾、澎湖列岛不是早已归中华人民共和国管辖了吗？杜勒斯、艾森豪威尔为美国侵略计划所找的论据，真是太可笑太可怜了！
    杜勒斯说：“美国负有条约义务来帮助保卫台湾不受武装进攻，国会的联合决议授权总统使用美国的武装部队来确保和保护像金门和马祖等有关阵地。”什么条约义务呢？就是1954年12月2日美国同蒋介石卖国集团签订的所谓“共同防御条约”。这个“条约”是被全中国人民唾弃的蒋介石卖国贼所写的一张卖身文契，这个“条约”也是美帝国主义侵占中国领土的铁证。被中国人民所打败，逃到台湾去的蒋介石卖国集团根本没有任何权利同任何国家签订任何条约。因之，所谓美蒋“共同防御条约”根本是非法的，无效的。美国侵占台湾和澎湖列岛，并企图把这种直接侵略扩大到金门、马祖，是干涉我国内政，侵犯中国领土完整和主权的非法行为。联合国宪章明确规定不得侵犯任何国家的领土完整和政治独立，美国的侵略行动是完全违反联合国宪章和一切国际法准则的。至于说到美国国会通过的决议，那么，谁给了美国国会通过这种违反联合国宪章和国际法准则、干涉外国内政的决议的权利？难道全世界就是美国的一个洲？这个所谓授权总统使用美国武装部队阻挠我解放金门和马祖的决议如果有什么意义，那只是它进一步证实了美国武装干涉中国内政和进行战争威胁的罪恶行径。无论什么国家的人民，也不会由于有了美国国会作出了决议，而承认自己的领土应该为美国所占领的。因之，美国和蒋介石集团所签订的任何所谓“条约”和美国国会通过的任何有关决议，在中国人民和世界人民面前，在联合国宪章和国际法准则面前，在真理和正义面前，都是完全非法的，无效的。
    目前台湾海峡地区的紧张局势，根源于美国帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。自从中国人民解放了大陆之后，蒋介石卖国集团就在它的美国主子的支持和唆使之下，一直对大陆进行骚扰，从来没有停止过。蒋介石匪帮盘据着金门和马祖，直接威胁厦门和福州的安全，这两个港口的对外航运经常受到袭击。由于美国在台湾海峡地区集结了庞大的舰队和飞机，进行战争威胁，这一地区一直存在着紧张状态。从美国发动侵略中东的战争以后，蒋介石集团在美国支持下，从金门和马祖等沿海岛屿加紧了骚扰活动，并且一再叫嚷“相机加速进行反攻大陆的准备”。早在中国人民解放军严惩金门蒋贼军的一个多月以前，蒋介石集团就取消了官兵休假，积极备战。蒋介石集团的飞机加紧了向大陆的袭扰，它的舰只加紧了对沿海地区的活动。也正因为这个缘故，中国人民解放军对盘据在沿海岛屿的蒋介石部队给了沉重的打击。这是完全属于中国政府内政范围内的事情。但是美国侵略者在对中东的侵略遭到全世界的谴责之后，为了转移全世界人民的视线，拖延在黎巴嫩的撤兵，竟在台湾海峡地区大量集结武装力量，公然对中国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，并且要把它在台湾地区的侵略范围扩大到金门、马祖等沿海岛屿。美国的这种行动，是对中国六万万人民的严重挑衅，也是对世界和平的严重威胁。
    可是，美国侵略者应当记住：中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和澎湖列岛的决心是不可动摇的。美国任何战争挑衅都吓不倒中国人民。相反地，只会激起六万万人民更大的愤怒。当1946年美帝国主义支持蒋介石卖国集团，发动全面内战，硬把战争强加到中国人民头上的时候，中国人民并没有被吓倒，而是在中国共产党领导之下，奋起迎战，一直到消灭了四百万全副美式装备的蒋帮正规军，把蒋介石卖国集团连同它的主子美帝国主义者一古脑儿赶得落海而逃。1950年秋，美国打着联合国的蓝色大旗，纠集十六国的军队，不顾中国人民的警告，在朝鲜越过三八线向我国边境进犯，并且派出大批飞机，侵入我国东北领空，投弹扫射，打到鸭绿江边，事实同杜勒斯在声明中所说的相反，绝不是中国在朝鲜用武装力量来实现“领土野心”，而恰恰是美国侵略者企图用武装力量，不仅在朝鲜，而且还要在中国实现它的“领土野心”的时候，在美帝国主义硬把战争强加到我们头上的时候，我国人民就派出了中国人民志愿军，同朝鲜人民一起，粉碎了美国侵略者先占朝鲜、再征服中国的狂妄计划。难道杜勒斯之流认为中国人民给美国侵略者的教训还不够吗？中国人民虽然是爱好和平的，如果健忘的美帝国主义一定要武装干涉我国的内政，一定要同中国人民较量较量的话，那么，我们中国人民是不会不懂得礼尚往来的。我国人民一定奋起自卫，坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭侵略者。
    美国在我国的台湾地区制造紧张局势，使东方出现了战争的乌云，这又一次在全世界人民面前暴露了美帝国主义的凶恶面目。中国人民的正义斗争，得到了各国人民的有力支持。苏联真理报评论员指出：“同中华人民共和国有着兄弟友谊和互相援助关系的苏联人民，将用一切方法援助自己的兄弟——中国人民，来约束厚颜无耻的、轻举妄动的冒险之徒——战争挑拨者。”
    越南、朝鲜、蒙古、捷克斯洛伐克、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、民主德国的报纸也先后发表评论，严厉斥责美帝国主义者侵占台湾和向人民中国挑衅，支持中国人民反对美国侵略者的斗争。
    阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔说：“当中国人民要实现他们的愿望和保有他们的全部领土时，就发生了帝国主义的军事干涉。真正的干涉是台湾遭到占领”。
    开罗“晚报”说：“支持中国就是支持我们自己的事业，也是支持和平力量对战争的胜利、人民力量对帝国主义的胜利”。印中友好协会主席森德拉尔说：“让美帝国主义理解到危机迫在眉睫的预兆。让他们认识到印度，所有阿拉伯国家、苏联和社会主义国家、真理和正义都是在中国这一边。”
    久经革命斗争锻炼的中国人民，是吓不倒也骗不了的。中国人民完全有权采取一切适当的方法，在适当的时候，解放自己的领土，不容许任何外国的干涉。当着美帝国主义已经陈兵台湾海峡，向中国人民进行严重的战争挑衅的时候，中国人民必须立即动员起来，为粉碎美国侵略者的任何挑衅而斗争到底！以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，亚非地区的维护和平和反对侵略的国家和广大人民，以及全世界一切反对侵略爱好和平的人民，都是和我们站在一起的。让美帝国主义的挑衅，在中国人民和全世界人民的共同反击下，再一次遭到彻底的失败！
