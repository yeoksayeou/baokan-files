　　Propaganda Work Must Break Out of Its Small Circle
　　Yu Shu
　　The process of transforming the Party's guidelines and policies into the practical actions of the broad masses is also a process of repeated propaganda. Who should be relied upon for propaganda? Should we rely on a few cadres or the broad masses? The experience of Beigu Township in Suining County, Sichuan Province, provides a definite answer: We cannot rely solely on a few cadres; we must also rely on the broad masses.
　　All of the Party's guidelines and policies come first from the masses and then return to the masses. Therefore, once the Party's guidelines and policies meet the masses, they will be approved and supported by the majority of the masses. The implementation of the Party's guidelines and policies mainly relies on these masses, and the struggle against conservative and backward thinking that is hesitant, wavering, or even resistant to the Party's guidelines and policies also mainly relies on these masses. So, why can't propaganda work, which is a powerful weapon for overcoming conservative and backward thinking, mainly rely on these masses? Facts have proven that it is entirely possible. As long as we break the mysterious views on propaganda work and hand over the propaganda tasks to the masses, the face of propaganda work will immediately undergo a major change.
　　Why? This is because:
　　Relying on the broad masses allows for propaganda to be carried out anytime, anywhere. As long as there are masses, there is propaganda and mobilization. Problems can be discovered and materials written and disseminated immediately. Advanced experiences can be promoted immediately, advanced deeds can be commended immediately, and shortcomings and errors can be criticized immediately. How could relying on a few cadres achieve this kind of speed and timeliness?
　　Relying on the broad masses allows for propaganda to be closely integrated with various specific production tasks and measures. If there is a need to accumulate fertilizer, materials encouraging fertilizer accumulation can be written immediately; if there is a need to weed, materials encouraging weeding can be written immediately; if there is a need to eliminate the four pests, materials encouraging the elimination of the four pests can be written immediately. In this way, the purpose of propaganda is very clear, the content is very specific, and the effect is very practical. How could relying on a few cadres achieve such close integration with production activities?
　　Relying on the broad masses can make propaganda work deeper and broader. This is not only because there are more people involved in propaganda, but also because the forms of propaganda are better. The propaganda materials written by the masses themselves are popular, specific, and vivid, and the masses are happy to see and hear them. They are easy to understand and easy to remember. Therefore, many propaganda materials, once written, are often passed down from house to house and spread like wildfire, and they penetrate deeply into people's hearts. How could relying on a few cadres achieve such widespread and in-depth results?
　　Relying on the broad masses for propaganda work does not mean that the role of cadres in propaganda work can be ignored. To organize the broad masses to carry out propaganda, the Party organization cannot simply mobilize the masses and consider the job done. It must strengthen leadership, make arrangements, conduct inspections, and make summaries. It must provide concrete help and guidance, and solve various problems and difficulties in propaganda work. All of this is inseparable from cadres. The constant help and guidance of cadres in propaganda work should be well combined with the active participation of the broad masses in propaganda activities. Neither should be neglected.
　　The mass line is the fundamental line of our Party in carrying out all work. Without it, any work will go down a dead end. Propaganda work is no exception.

　　宣传工作必须跳出小圈子
　　于蜀
    把党的方针、政策变成广大群众实际行动的过程，也就是反复宣传的过程。依靠谁来宣传？是依靠少数干部呢？还是依靠广大群众？四川省遂宁县北固乡的经验作了肯定的回答：不能仅仅依靠少数干部，必须同时依靠广大群众。
    党的一切方针、政策都是先从群众中来，再到群众中去，因此，党的任何方针政策一经和群众见面，就会得到多数群众的赞同和拥护。实现党的方针、政策主要依靠这些群众，同那些对党的方针、政策犹疑、动摇甚至抵触的保守落后思想斗争也主要靠这些群众，那么，作为克服保守落后思想的有力武器的宣传工作，为什么不能主要靠这些群众呢？事实证明，完全能够，只要打破宣传工作上的神秘观点，把宣传任务交给群众，宣传工作的面貌立即会发生大变化。
    为什么？这是因为：
    依靠广大群众，可以随时随地进行宣传，只要有群众，就有宣传鼓动。当时发现什么问题，当时就编出来，当时就传出去。先进经验立即可以推广，先进事迹立即得到表扬，缺点和错误也立即受到批评。要是依靠少数干部如何能作得这样迅速及时呢？
    依靠广大群众，可以密切结合各种具体的生产任务和生产措施进行宣传。要积肥，可以马上编出鼓动积肥的材料，要除草，可以马上编出除草的材料，要除四害，可以马上编出除四害的材料。这样，宣传的目的非常明确，内容非常具体，效果也非常切实，要是依靠少数干部如何能和生产活动结合得这样密切呢？
    依靠广大群众，可以使宣传工作作得更深更广，这不单单因为宣传的人多，而且因为宣传的形式也好。群众自己编的宣传材料，形式通俗具体生动，群众喜见乐闻，既容易懂，又容易记，因而很多宣传材料一编出来，常常是家传户诵，不胫而走，而且深入人心，要是依靠少数干部，如何能作得这样广泛而深入呢？
    宣传工作依靠广大群众，并不是说可以忽视干部在宣传工作中的作用。要组织广大群众进行宣传，党组织不能仅仅把群众发动起来就算完事，必须加强领导，要作布置，作检查，作总结，要进行具体的帮助和指导，要解决宣传工作中的各种问题和困难。这一切，都离不开干部。应该把干部对宣传工作的经常帮助和指导同广大群众积极参加宣传活动很好的结合起来，二者不可偏废。
    群众路线是我们党进行一切工作的根本路线，离开了它，任何工作都会走了死胡同，宣传工作同样不能例外。
