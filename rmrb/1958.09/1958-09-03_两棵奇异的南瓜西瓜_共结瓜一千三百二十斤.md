Two Extraordinary Pumpkins and Watermelons
Yield a Total of 1,320 Jin of Produce

Zhang Ximeng, forestry section chief of the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Changleji Township, Cao County, Shandong, creatively cultivated one pumpkin and one watermelon in alkaline land within a forest network, yielding a total of seventy-two large melons with a net weight of 1,320 jin. Many visitors have called them two "rockets" that will carry giant "satellites" into the sky.

On August 30th, Wu Lianjing of the County Party Committee Office, along with township and cooperative cadres and many members of the masses, jointly organized an acceptance inspection. Each of the seventy-two large melons still growing on the vines was weighed individually. The pumpkin vine yielded forty-five melons, five weighing over thirty jin, eighteen weighing over twenty jin, twelve weighing over ten jin, and the remaining ten weighing less than ten jin. The watermelon vine yielded twenty-seven melons, weighing 430 jin, averaging sixteen jin each. Fearing calculation problems, they will send these two pumpkins and watermelons, vines and all, to the county exhibition hall in their original form.

The cultivation process of this miracle was as follows: This year, during the first month of the lunar calendar, Zhang Ximeng dug two large pits, one meter square, in the alkaline land within the forest network. He mixed dry manure, flour, and soil, and applied it to the pit in a layer about one cun thick. After sun-drying for more than ten days, he applied another layer, filling the pit in six applications. He planted the seeds in early March, and applied fertilizer and watered them in twelve installments, each time using about 120 jin of water. While not interfering with the collective labor of the cooperative, Comrade Zhang Ximeng diligently cultivated and carefully managed them by getting up early and going to bed late. This truly demonstrates that "production potential is limitless, it all depends on whether there is determination."

This amazing story quickly spread throughout the county, and many people came to visit and learn from the experience.

　　两棵奇异的南瓜西瓜
　　共结瓜一千三百二十斤
    山东曹县常乐集乡红旗农业社林业股长张喜梦，在林网碱地创造性地培植了南瓜西瓜各一棵，共结七十二个大瓜，净重一千三百二十斤。许多来往参观的人们称为两支“火箭”，将带着巨型“卫星”飞向天空。
    8月30日，县委办公室吴连景同志配合乡、社干部和许多群众共同组织了验收，对这七十二个仍然生长在秧上的大瓜一一进行了过秤，一棵南瓜结四十五个瓜，三十斤以上的五个，二十斤以上的十八个，十斤以上的十二个，其余十个在十斤以下。那棵西瓜结了二十七个瓜，重四百三十斤，平均每个合十六斤。他们怕算账派不好算账，把这两棵南瓜西瓜连秧带瓜原型不动将送入县展览馆。
    这个奇迹的培植过程是这样的：张喜梦在今年旧历正月初在林网碱地上挖了两个一公尺见方的大坑，把大粪干面和土拌匀施入坑内一层，约一公寸厚，经太阳晒十几天后再施入一层，共六次填满坑。三月初下种，分期施肥和浇水十二次，每次用水量约一百二十斤，并在不误社内集体劳动的情况下，张喜梦同志起早、晚睡精心培植、细心管理。这真是“增产潜力无限，单看有无决心”。
    这个奇闻很快传遍了全县，许多人纷纷前来参观学习经验。
