    The More Blood Debts, the Tighter the Noose
    By People's Daily Commentator
    On September 7th, a U.S. soldier stationed in Japan, Rumple, shot at a moving streetcar for no reason, killing Japanese college student Shoji Miyamura. The bloody traces of Jerard's shooting of Japanese farm woman Sakae Nakako have not yet faded from memory, and American soldiers have committed another bloody crime of killing for pleasure in Japan. This once again clearly demonstrates that if the United States does not abolish its military bases in Japan and withdraw its troops from Japan, the Japanese people will have to constantly live under the threat of American guns. Every Japanese person may become a live target for American soldiers, who have a sense of racial superiority and despise the lives of the Japanese people, to play games with.
    Demanding that the United States abolish its military bases in Japan and withdraw its troops from Japan has always been one of the central topics of the Japanese people's struggle for peace, democracy, and independence. This struggle is developing and expanding day by day. The innocent blood of Shoji Miyamura will, like the blood of Sakae Nakako, ignite the anger of the Japanese people and push this struggle to a new high.
    The struggle of the Japanese people is arduous. This is not only because Japan is the country with the most U.S. military bases in the world, and the United States will not easily relax its control over Japan; but also because those who hold the helm of Japanese political life are a small group of unashamed and ambitious figures who represent the interests of monopoly capital and disregard national dignity and sell out national interests. In order to realize their potential imperialist ambitions, and in order to beg for dollars and realize the long-cherished wish of Japanese monopoly capital to carry out economic expansion in Southeast Asia with the help of American funds, they are following American intentions, regardless of the strong opposition of the Japanese people, and are stepping up efforts to drag Japan into the American atomic strategic system. Recently, Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama visited the United States, and it is said that one of the items to be discussed was the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Japanese government released air that Japan will demand to have a greater say in the issue of the United States mobilizing troops stationed at bases in Japan, but according to foreign news agencies, U.S. officials stated that in order to satisfy Japan's desire for "equality" in all clauses, if the treaty is revised, it must stipulate that Japan should assume some obligations that are not currently permitted by the Japanese Constitution. This means that once a war breaks out, Japan should also send troops abroad to assist the United States in combat. Obviously, this is not a question of striving for autonomy, but of further strengthening Japan-U.S. military cooperation. The Japanese government wants to use this as a price to win the favor of the United States and ask the United States to provide 1 billion U.S. dollars as a special fund for investment in Southeast Asia. This is the main purpose of Fujiyama's visit to the United States. Regardless of whether the Japanese government's calculations can be realized, this dangerous transaction cannot but arouse the vigilance of the Japanese people.
    The United States is using its Japanese lackeys to tie Japan more and more tightly to its chariot. But facts will prove that their actions must go in the opposite direction of their wishes. The Japanese people, who have experienced the tragedy of World War II, will not allow war criminals like Nobusuke Kishi to push them into a greater war disaster again, nor will the Japanese people be willing to play the role of live targets for American soldiers. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: The bases established by the United States all over the world "are all nooses around the neck of U.S. imperialism." The more blood debts accumulate, the tighter the noose will be fastened. The more severe the oppression, the more violent the resistance will be. This time, the innocent killing of Shoji Miyamura will surely become a signal for the outbreak of the Japanese people's accumulated anger, just like the Jerard incident.
    This time, the Japanese government once again pretended to announce that the case of the shooting of Shoji Miyamura should be handed over to the Japanese court for trial. The U.S. military authorities in Japan have also been forced to agree to hand over Rumple to the Japanese court for trial. But from last year's Jerard incident, it is not difficult for people to see what kind of despicable farce this so-called "trial by the Japanese court" is. The murderer Jerard was not finally acquitted and returned home carefree? The trick can only be played once, and it won't work if you play it again. The fundamental issue is that the United States must abolish its military bases in Japan and withdraw its troops from Japan. Otherwise, the Japanese people will never be able to avoid the fate of being killed at will like insects. But this fate will also accelerate the mobilization of the Japanese people to rise up against the American occupiers and tighten the noose around the necks of the American occupiers.

    血债愈多，绞索愈紧
    本报评论员
    9月7日，驻日本的美国军队的一个士兵朗普雷无故向行驶中的电车开枪，打死日本大学生宫村祥之。哲腊德枪杀日本农妇坂井奈加子的斑斑血迹，在人们记忆中还未褪色，美国兵在日本又作了一桩杀人作乐的血案。这又一次清楚地说明，美国不撤销它在日本的军事基地和从日本撤出它的军队，日本人民就不得不经常处于美国枪口的威胁之下，不知什么时候，每一个日本人都有可能成为具有种族优越感贱视日本人民生命的美国大兵的游戏作乐的活靶子。
    要求美国撤销它在日本的军事基地和撤出它在日本的军队，一直是日本人民争取和平、民主和独立斗争的中心课题之一。这个斗争正在一天天发展、扩大。宫村祥之的无辜的鲜血，将同坂井奈加子的血一样，激起日本人民的怒火，把这个斗争推向一个新的高潮。
    日本人民的斗争是艰巨的。这不仅因为日本是世界上美国军事基地最多的国家，美国不会轻易放松它对日本的控制；而且也因为把持日本政治生活舵轮的，是代表垄断资本利益的一小撮不顾民族尊严、出卖民族利益的没廉耻的野心家。他们为了实现潜在的帝国主义野心，为了乞求美元，借美国资金的帮助实现日本垄断资本向东南亚进行经济扩张的宿愿，正在按照美国意旨，不顾日本人民的强烈反对，加紧把日本拖进美国原子战略体系里去。最近日本外务相藤山访问美国，据说所要讨论的项目之一，是修改日美“安全条约”问题。日本政府放出空气说，日本将要求在美国调动驻扎在日本基地的部队问题上享有更大的发言权，但据外国通讯社透露，美国官员表示，为了满足日本要求在一切条款上“平等”的愿望，条约如果修改，就必须规定日本要承担一些目前日本宪法不许承担的义务。这就是说，一旦发生战争，日本也应派兵出国协助美国作战。显然，这不是什么争取自主，而是进一步加强日美军事合作。日本政府想以此为代价，取得美国欢心，要美国拿出十亿美元充作东南亚投资特别基金。这就是藤山这次访美的主要目的。姑不论日本政府的算盘是否能够实现，但这笔危险的交易不能不引起日本人民警惕。
    美国正在通过它的日本走卒，把日本越来越紧地拴在它的战车上。但事实会证明，他们的作法一定要走向他们的愿望的反面。经历过第二次世界大战惨祸的日本人民，不会听任战犯岸信介之流再一次把他们推向更大的战争灾难，日本人民也不会甘于充当美国大兵的活靶子的命运。正如毛泽东同志所说：美国在全世界建立的基地，“都是套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索”。血债积得越多，绞索也将扣得越紧。压迫得越凶，反抗得也会越猛。这次宫村祥之的无辜被杀，一定会同哲腊德事件一样成为日本人民积愤爆发的一个信号。
    日本政府这次又装模作样地宣布，枪杀宫村祥之的案件，应该交由日本法庭审判。在日本的美军当局也已被迫同意将朗普雷交由日本法庭审判。但人们从去年的哲腊德事件，不难看出这种所谓“由日本法庭审判”是一种怎样卑劣的丑剧。杀人的凶犯哲腊德最后还不是等于无罪开释，逍遥自在地回国去了吗？戏法只能变一次，再变就不灵了。根本的问题在于美国必须撤销它在日本的军事基地和从日本撤退它的军队，否则，日本人民始终不能免于像虫豸一样随便遭受杀害的命运。但是这种命运也会加速动员日本人民起来反抗美国占领者，把美国占领者套在自己脖子上的绞索，越拉拉紧。
