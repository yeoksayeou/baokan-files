The literacy campaign in the Ningxia region has reached a new high tide. Currently, over 90% of young and middle-aged illiterates of the Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups in the region have engaged in cultural studies, and more than 150,000 people have been eager to shed their illiterate status.

The literacy movement has powerfully promoted production. In Huinong County, most of the accountants and work-point recorders in the agricultural cooperatives' production teams are now filled by personnel who have escaped illiteracy, and twelve people have even become production team leaders and cooperative committee members. In Zhangyi District of Guyuan County, more than 500 people have shaken off illiteracy, and more than 240 of them have become accountants and literacy teachers in agricultural cooperatives, thereby changing the past situation of incorrectly issuing work tickets, incorrectly recording work points, and traveling long distances to ask people to write letters. After the broad masses of people can read and study, their enthusiasm for production is even higher. Hui and Han farmers happily say: "Culture has turned over, running the cooperative doesn't require outsiders."

Now, the students who have already escaped illiteracy are continuing to advance towards culture and science, and many of them have been admitted to agricultural universities, agricultural middle schools, and senior primary schools to study. (Xinhua News Agency)

    文化翻了身　办社不求人
    宁夏地区扫除文盲工作出现新的高潮。目前全区回、汉等族青壮年文盲已有90％以上投入文化学习，其中有十五万多人已争先摆脱了文盲状态。
    扫盲运动有力地推动了生产。惠农县各农业社生产队的会计和记工员，目前大部分都已由摆脱文盲状态的人员担任，有十二人并且当了生产队长和社务委员。固原县张义区已摆脱文盲状态的五百多人，有二百四十多人分别当了农业社的会计和扫盲教师，从而改变了过去错发工票、错记工分和跑远路请人写信的状况。广大群众能认字读书以后，生产情绪更高，回、汉族农民们高兴地说：“文化翻了身，办社不求人。”
    现在，已经摆脱文盲状态的学员，正在继续向文化科学进军，其中许多人已分别升入农业大学、农业中学和高小学习。　（新华社）
