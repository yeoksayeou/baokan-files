    Autumn Harvest and Autumn Planting—Two Major Events in Current Agricultural Production

    White Dew has passed, and the autumn harvest and planting are about to begin. The current urgent task is to continue to grasp the management of autumn fields, and at the same time, rapidly prepare for the autumn harvest and planting to ensure a bumper harvest this year and a greater leap forward in the yield of summer crops next year.

    At present, the growth of more than one billion mu of autumn harvest crops across the country is very good. Since all regions have conscientiously implemented the Central Committee's instructions on grasping autumn field management, new phenomena of "three mores and three lesses" have emerged in the management of autumn crops: more irrigation and topdressing, more cultivation and weeding, and more spraying of pesticides; fewer weak seedlings, fewer weeds, and fewer pests and diseases. It can be affirmed that this year's autumn harvest crops will have more large-scale, high-yield fields than summer harvest crops. The comprehensive victory of the simultaneous leap forward in grain, cotton, oil, and other cash crops in 1958 will finally become a reality. On the other hand, the area of autumn fields this year is larger than in previous years, and the crops are planted more densely, so the harvest will inevitably require more labor. The planned planting area for summer crops in 1959 is more than 700 million mu, an increase of more than 100 million mu compared to 1958. Among them, the winter wheat area accounts for more than 430 million mu, an increase of more than 70 million mu compared to 1958; the rapeseed area is more than 60 million mu, an increase of more than 27 million mu compared to 1958. This year's autumn planting requires all regions to plant winter wheat, rapeseed, and other crops on deeply plowed land. The base fertilizer for autumn planting generally requires more than 30,000 jin per mu, and it needs to be applied to the soil in layers while plowing. In addition, large-scale industries are being developed everywhere, requiring a large amount of rural labor support. All of this is a new problem and a new contradiction that has not been encountered in the past. However, inspired by the upsurge of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture and the establishment of people's communes, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants is soaring, and their energy is multiplied. Under the great leap forward, leaders at all levels have gained rich experience and mastered the laws of leading the great leap forward in production. As long as we adhere to putting politics in command, fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, give play to the wisdom of the masses, vigorously carry out technical reforms, rationally arrange labor, and organize communist cooperation, the above tasks can be fully completed. All regions should regard doing a good job in autumn harvest and planting as the first battle to win a greater harvest and a greater leap forward in the upsurge of establishing people's communes. Currently, the most important thing is to combine the movement to establish people's communes, deeply carry out a great debate on strengthening autumn production, so that the broad masses of cadres and peasants recognize the great political and economic significance of doing a good job in autumn harvest and planting, effectively criticize the right-leaning conservative attitude of "not being in a hurry" about autumn harvest and planting, and mobilize everyone to formulate measures and think of strategies to ensure a bumper harvest and timely planting.

    Doing a good job in the autumn harvest is the final hurdle to achieving a comprehensive great leap forward in agricultural production this year. The content of the autumn harvest is complicated, and there are many preparatory tasks that need to be carried out as soon as possible. It is necessary to first grasp the most important work. For late rice, corn, sorghum, millet, sweet potatoes, cotton, peanuts, and other late autumn crops that are currently growing, we must continue to strengthen late-stage management to strive for high yields and bumper harvests. We must be vigilant, prepare well, and prevent and overcome all possible natural disasters. Past experience tells us that autumn is a season with many natural disasters. Even during the harvesting stage, natural disasters of one kind or another often occur, causing losses to mature crops. Since the beginning of autumn this year, some areas have experienced disasters such as floods, droughts, hail, wind, and insects. We should think of the worst and be prepared to overcome the natural disasters that may be encountered in a timely manner, and never let the fruits of production that are about to be obtained be lost. We must immediately carry out ideological education work among the masses to cherish public property and cherish the fruits of labor. In previous years, some areas have done autumn harvest work very roughly, discarding and wasting a lot of grain. This year's autumn harvest will be unprecedented, and some people think that there is a lot of grain, so it doesn't matter if a little is wasted. This kind of thinking must be overcome. The more abundant the harvest, the more we must cherish the fruits of our labor. Every people's commune and agricultural cooperative must promptly make material preparations for careful harvesting and threshing, carry out ideological education among the masses to cherish public property, and ensure that crops are harvested as they ripen, harvested cleanly, and all grains are returned to the granary. Only in this way can we achieve a bumper harvest.

    Another important thing in the autumn harvest is to do a good job in seed selection. Before the harvest of various autumn crops, specialized seed selection groups should be organized to carry out meticulous seed selection in the fields, implement single harvesting and single collection, and prepare conditions for obtaining a greater harvest next year. Every people's commune and agricultural cooperative must select and reserve good seeds and properly store them.

    This year, the planting area of sweet potatoes is large, the yield is high, and the production area is relatively concentrated. Harvesting, storage, and utilization are a big problem. This requires all regions to be fully prepared in terms of labor, tools, and other equipment, and to promptly do a good job in harvesting, transportation, storage, processing, and comprehensive utilization. Only when all of the above-mentioned work is done well and the unprecedentedly abundant grain and other agricultural products are harvested can it be said that victory has been finally won.

    Planting is the first step in realizing a greater leap forward in production next year, and it must be done well. The fact that there was a bumper harvest this summer proves that summer crops such as wheat have great potential for increasing production. Developing wheat production and increasing the proportion of summer crops in annual agricultural production is a strategic measure for striving for agricultural production increase in the future. Therefore, we must strive for the national summer grain output next year to account for 40% to 50% of the total annual grain output. Hebei Province planted more than 20 million mu of wheat last year. This year, the provincial party committee decided to plant 40 million mu of wheat in the autumn, striving to plant 45 million mu, ensuring a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and next year, the province should average 1,000 jin of wheat per person. This is an active decision. All regions that have the conditions to increase the wheat planting area should increase it. Henan Province should also strive to become a province with a wheat yield of 1,000 jin per mu next year. In order to ensure a greater leap forward in the yield of summer crops next year, it is necessary to sow in a timely manner according to the planting plan and ensure the quality of sowing. This year's requirement is to universally implement intensive cultivation centered on deep plowing and close planting for all summer crops, strive to increase the yield per unit area, and strive to achieve the magnificent indicators of wheat yield increase in various regions.

    The experience of high yields of various crops this year proves that deep plowing and soil improvement are a fundamental measure for increasing agricultural production. According to Hebei Province's experience this year, with the same soil quality and the same management measures, the yield differs by about 30% to one-fold depending on whether the soil is plowed or not, deeply plowed or shallowly plowed, and improved or not improved. When arranging autumn (winter) planting tasks, all regions must deeply plow the land in accordance with the requirements of the Central Committee's instructions on deep plowing and soil improvement, generally more than one chi, and high-yield fields and satellite fields should be plowed even deeper. At the same time, it is also necessary to prepare a large amount of fertilizer and apply sufficient base fertilizer in layers in conjunction with deep plowing, which is conducive to the development of wheat roots. Hebei Province has decided to deeply plow all wheat fields by one chi and five cun and apply 100,000 jin of base fertilizer, so that all wheat fields are water conservancy and gardenized. Henan Province requires 3 million mu of land to be deeply plowed every day, and 80 million mu must be completed within 30 days, and 50,000 jin of base fertilizer must be applied per mu. The implementation of deep plowing and sufficient fertilizer can prepare better conditions for close planting. From the perspective of some high-yield typical examples this year, it is difficult to achieve a yield of 1,000 jin per mu without about 500,000 spikes of wheat per mu; it is difficult to break through 3,000 jin without more than 1 million spikes. We must plant wheat densely, with large spikes, many grains, and heavy grains, so that we can definitely achieve high yields.

    Due to the expansion of autumn sowing area this year, the implementation of highly dense planting and the replacement of improved varieties, various regions are very short of improved seeds, and we must find ways to adjust them locally as soon as possible, so as not to hinder timely sowing.

    This year's autumn harvest and planting tasks are much heavier than in previous years. It is estimated that the workload of harvesting autumn and planting wheat will increase by three to four times compared to last year. How to solve the problem of insufficient labor? The fundamental way to solve this problem at present is to vigorously carry out the agricultural tool reform movement centered on rolling bearing, and improve labor productivity. At present, we should mainly concentrate our efforts on improving and promoting deep plows, rope-drawn plows, dense planting seeders, and various harvesting and threshing tools and sweet potato slicing machines, and install rolling bearings on all operating tools to ensure that improved agricultural tools are used in most or all of the autumn harvest. In order to tap the potential of labor, all people's communes and agricultural cooperatives need to universally establish public canteens and nurseries, and implement mechanized grain processing and sewing to free up a large number of female laborers to participate in production. At the same time, we can adopt the method of "women replacing men" to temporarily replace the male laborers among the breeders, processors, and accountants and put them into the autumn harvest and planting work. The iron and woodworking workers and professional laborers in farmland capital construction within the cooperative, as well as the industrial laborers in their townships and cooperatives, should also take time to rush to harvest and plant autumn crops. Cooperative cadres should all go to the fields to produce. During the busy autumn harvest and planting season, cadres and students from agencies, schools, and grassroots commercial departments can also be mobilized to support the autumn harvest and planting. Another way to solve the labor problem is to improve labor organization. According to the autumn harvest and planting tasks of the cooperative and team, the method of professional teams and "five fixings" (fixing special personnel, fixing time, fixing tasks, fixing quality, and fixing remuneration) should be universally promoted, and the principle of "military organization, combat action, and collective life" should be adopted to rush to harvest and plant autumn crops. In addition, it is also necessary to organize communist cooperation between regions and between townships and cooperatives. During the busy autumn harvest and planting season, advanced regions should support backward regions, and regions with small autumn planting tasks, many draft animals, and abundant labor should actively support regions with large tasks.

    In order to make agricultural production leap forward at a higher speed on the basis of this year's bumper harvest, we must earnestly summarize the experience of this year's great leap forward in agricultural production during and after the autumn harvest. The experience of large-scale and high-yield production of different crops should be summarized by designated personnel in a planned manner. Starting from this year's autumn planting, special personnel should be organized to conduct systematic observation, which is of extremely great significance to thoroughly break the right-leaning conservative ideas such as "condition theory" and "low-yield theory," further liberate people's minds, and promote a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year.

    秋收秋种——当前农业生产上的两件大事
    白露已过，秋收秋种就要开始了。当前的紧迫任务，就是在继续抓紧秋田管理的同时，迅速做好秋收秋种的各项准备工作，千方百计确保今年的丰产丰收和明年夏收作物产量更大的跃进。
    目前全国十多亿亩秋收作物的生长情况十分良好。各地认真贯彻中央关于抓紧秋田管理的指示以后，秋收作物管理上出现了“三多三少”的新现象：灌溉追肥多、中耕除草多、喷撒药剂多；弱苗少、杂草少、病虫为害少。可以肯定，今年的秋收作物比夏收作物将有更多的大面积高额丰产田出现。1958年的粮食、棉花、油料及其他经济作物并肩跃进的全面胜利将最后成为现实。另一方面，今年秋田的面积比往年大，作物种植也比较密，收获必更费工。1959年夏收作物计划种植面积是七亿多亩，比1958年扩大一亿亩以上。其中冬小麦面积占四亿三千多万亩，比1958年扩大七千多万亩；油菜籽面积六千多万亩，比1958年扩大二千七百多万亩。今年秋种要求各地做到冬小麦、油菜籽等作物，都种在深翻地上，秋种底肥一般要求每亩在三万斤以上，而且需要在耕翻的同时分层施到地里。加上各地大办工业，需要农村劳力大量支援。所有这一切，都是以往所没有遇到的新问题，新矛盾。但是，由于工农业大跃进和建立人民公社的高潮的鼓舞，广大农民的情绪沸腾，干劲倍增，各级领导在大跃进形势锻炼下，有了丰富的经验，掌握了领导生产大跃进的规律，只要我们坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，依靠群众，发挥群众智慧，大搞技术改革，合理安排劳力，组织共产主义大协作，上述各项任务是完全可以完成的。各地应该把搞好秋收秋种作为建立人民公社高潮中争取更大丰收更大跃进的第一个战斗。当前最重要的是，应当结合建立人民公社运动，深入开展加强秋季生产的大辩论，使广大干部和农民认识到做好秋收秋种工作的重大政治意义和经济意义，有效地批判那种对秋收秋种“不慌不忙”的右倾保守的态度，发动大家订措施，想计策，保证丰产丰收和适时种好。
    做好秋收工作，是实现今年农业生产全面大跃进的最后一关。秋收的内容繁杂，需要及早进行的准备工作也极多，必须首先抓住最重要的工作。对于正在生长的晚稻、玉米、高粱、谷子、甘薯、棉花、花生及其他晚秋作物，都要继续切实加强后期管理，力争高产丰收。要提高警惕，作好准备，防止与战胜一切可能发生的自然灾害。历年来的经验告诉我们：秋季乃是自然灾害很多的季节，即使到了收割阶段，也往往会发生这样或那样的自然灾害，使已经成熟的庄稼遭受损失。今年入秋以来，部分地区就曾发生水、旱、雹、风、虫等灾害。我们应当从最坏处着想，有准备地及时地战胜可能遇到的自然灾害，绝不让眼看要拿到手的生产果实受到损失。要马上在群众中进行爱护公共财产珍惜劳动成果的思想教育工作。历年来，总有些地区秋收工作做得很粗糙，抛撒和糟踏了不少粮食。今年的秋田丰收将是史无前例的，也有些人认为粮食多了，糟踏一点不要紧。这种思想必须克服，越是丰收，越要珍惜我们的劳动成果。每个人民公社和农业合作社都要及时做好精收细打的物质准备，在群众中进行爱护公共财物的思想教育，切实做到庄稼成熟一块收一块，收净打净，颗粒归仓，这样才能实现丰产丰收。
    在秋收中还有一件重要事情，就是做好选种工作。在各种秋季作物收获前，应当组织专业选种小组，在田间进行精细选种，实行单打单收，为明年获得更大的丰收准备条件。每个人民公社和农业社一定要把种籽选好留足，并妥善加以保管。
    今年甘薯种植面积大，产量高，产区比较集中，收获、贮藏和利用是个很大问题。这就要求各地在劳力、工具和其他设备等方面充分准备，及时做好收获、运输、贮藏、加工、综合利用等工作。只有把上面这许多工作都作好了，把空前丰收的粮食和其他农产收到家了，才能说最后地争得了胜利。
    播种工作，是实现明年生产更大跃进的第一步工作，必须作好。今年夏季丰收事实证明：小麦等夏收作物增产潜力很大，发展麦类生产，提高夏收作物生产在全年农业生产中的比重，是今后争取农业增产的一项具有战略意义的措施。因此，我们要力争明年全国夏收粮食产量占全年粮食总产量的40％到50％。河北省去年种小麦二千万多亩，今年省委决定秋种小麦四千万亩，争取种到四千五百万亩，保证亩产千斤，明年全省平均每人要拿到千斤麦。这是一个积极的决定。凡是有条件增加小麦播种面积的地区都应当增加。河南省也要争取在明年成为小麦亩产千斤省。为了保证明年夏收作物的产量有更大的跃进，必须按照播种计划，适时播种，并保证播种质量。今年的要求是：对于所有夏收作物普遍实行以深耕密植为中心的精耕细作，努力提高单位面积产量，力争实现各地小麦增产的雄伟指标。
    今年各种作物高产的经验证明：深翻土地，改良土壤，是农业增产的一项根本措施。据河北省今年的经验，同样的土质，同样的管理措施，耕与不耕，深耕与浅耕，改良与不改良土壤，产量相差30％至一倍左右。各地在布置秋（冬）种任务时，必须按照中央关于深耕和改良土壤的指示中的要求，深翻土地一般在一尺以上，丰产田、卫星田还要翻的更深。同时还要准备大量肥料，结合深翻地进行分层施足底肥，这样，有利于小麦的根系发育。河北省已经决定全部麦田深翻一尺五寸，施底肥十万斤，使全部麦田水利化、园田化。河南省要求每天深翻地三百万亩，要在三十天内完成八千万亩，施肥方面，保证每亩施五万斤底肥。实行了深耕，施足了肥料，就可以为密植准备更好的条件。从今年的某些丰产典型看来，每亩小麦没有五十万穗左右，亩产量就很难达到一千斤；没有一百万穗以上，就很难突破三千斤。我们一定要把小麦种植得株密、穗子大、籽粒多、麦粒重，这样就一定能达到高产。
    由于今年扩大秋播面积，实行高度密植和换种良种，各地优良种子很感不够，必须及早设法就地调剂，不要妨碍适时播种。
    今年的秋收秋种的任务比往年繁重得多，估计收秋种麦的工作量，较去年增加三、四倍以上。劳力不足的问题怎么解决呢？当前解决这个问题的根本途径是：大力开展以滚珠轴承化为中心的农具改革运动，提高劳动生产效率。目前主要应当集中力量改良和推广深耕犁、绳索牵引犁、密植耧和各式收割、脱粒工具及红薯切片机等，并给一切运转工具安装上滚珠轴承，保证在秋收中大部或全部使用改良农具。为了挖掘劳力潜力，各个人民公社和农业社，需要普遍建立公共食堂、托儿所，并实行粮食加工和缝纫机械化，腾出大批妇女劳力参加生产。同时可以采取“以女代男”的办法，将饲养员、加工业从业人员、会计员中的男劳力，暂时替换出来，投入秋收秋种工作中去。社内的铁木工人、农田基本建设专业劳力，及其乡、社的工业劳力，也要抽出时间突击秋收秋种。社干部应当人人下地生产。在秋收秋种紧张时期，还可以动员机关、学校、基层商业部门的干部和学生支援秋收秋种。解决劳力问题的另一个办法是改善劳动组织，要根据本社、本队秋收秋种的任务，普遍推行专业队和“五定”（定专人、定时间、定任务、定质量、定报酬）的办法，并采取“组织军事化，行动战斗化、生活集体化”的原则，突击秋收秋种。此外还要在地区之间、乡社之间，组织共产主义大协作。在秋收秋种的紧张时期，先进地区要支援落后地区，秋种任务小、耕畜多、劳力多的地区，应当积极主动支援任务大的地区。
    为了使明年农业生产在今年大丰收的基础上以更高的速度向前跃进，在秋收当中和秋收以后，要认真总结今年农业生产大跃进的经验。对于不同作物大面积丰产和高额丰产的经验，要有计划地指定专人进行总结。从今年秋种开始便组织专人进行系统观察，这对彻底打破“条件论”、“低产论”等右倾保守思想，进一步解放人们的思想，促进明年农业生产的更大跃进有极其重大的意义。
