Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The Fifth Congress of the International Student Union (ISU), in a "Resolution on Student Activities for the Maintenance of Peace" passed today, strongly condemned the aggression and provocative activities of US imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area. The resolution also demanded that the US and British governments, following the example of the Soviet government, immediately and unconditionally cease all nuclear weapons testing.

The resolution stated that the aggression and provocative actions of US imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area are a shameless interference in the internal affairs of the Chinese people. The resolution demanded that US troops immediately withdraw from this area.

The "Resolution on Student Activities for the Maintenance of Peace" called on students around the world to make the greatest efforts to maintain peace. The resolution pointed out that imperialism is the source of war, and therefore the struggle for peace must be closely linked with the struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

The congress also unanimously passed the "Resolution on the Situation in the Arab World." This resolution strongly condemned the aggressive acts of US and British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan. The resolution pointed out that the armed aggression of US and British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan, and the attempt to strangle the young Republic of Iraq, is not only an infringement on the national sovereignty of Lebanon and Jordan, but also a serious threat to peace in the Middle East and the world. The resolution clearly stated that the Fifth Congress of the International Student Union fully supports the heroic struggle of the people of Lebanon and Jordan, and demands that the US and British aggressor troops immediately withdraw from the Middle East.

The congress passed the "Appeal to the Students of the World" and a "Resolution on Student Publications and ISU Publications" aimed at strengthening and expanding mutual understanding and cooperation among students of various countries.

Today, the congress also unanimously approved the admission of the Pakistani student organization as an associate member of the ISU. In the three days prior to today, student representatives from various countries held heated and serious discussions in various groups on a series of draft resolutions to be adopted by the congress. Many draft resolutions with different contents regarding student anti-colonial activities will also be submitted to the congress tomorrow for continued passage.
