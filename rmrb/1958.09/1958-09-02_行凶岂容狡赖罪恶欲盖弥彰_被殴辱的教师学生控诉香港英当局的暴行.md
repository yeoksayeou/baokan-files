Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, September 1st: Teachers and students of the Chung Wah Middle School who were beaten and humiliated by the Hong Kong British police have successively complained to Xinhua News Agency reporters about the atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities. With the irrefutable facts of their personal experiences, they forcefully refuted the Hong Kong British authorities' evasive statement on the Chung Wah Middle School incident on the 29th.

The following are the true circumstances of the Hong Kong British police's violence as recounted by the victims:

    Dispatching Police to Surround the School

On the 26th, at 5:49 AM, Hong Kong British police, transported in ten large police vehicles and several private cars carrying plainclothes police, arrived outside Chung Wah Middle School under the command of a police vehicle equipped with radio equipment. Then, as if facing a formidable enemy, they urgently deployed, tightly surrounding the school. After more than a hundred police officers had completed the outer perimeter defense, Police Superintendent Morrison, in charge of the operation, led a large number of police officers into the school grounds.

    Ordering Closure, Expelling Teachers and Students

The forty-four teachers and students of Chung Wah Middle School in the school buildings were awakened by the Hong Kong British police's sudden raid. They sat quietly in rows in the school classrooms, protesting the British police's use of force to close their school. Thirteen Chinese journalists, promptly notified by the school, arrived to report the true situation on the scene. They conducted interviews separately in the school buildings and on the campus. After entering the school, Police Superintendent Morrison read out the "Closure Order" to Principal Huang Zufen, forcing the principal to accept it. Principal Huang immediately negotiated with reason. However, Morrison was impatient and, without waiting for Principal Huang to finish speaking, immediately ordered the police to escort Principal Huang and the two teachers accompanying him, Yan Yanxin and Huang Ningyi, away and keep them in a small room, preventing them from contacting the teachers and students in the classroom. After the police escorted the principal and two teachers away, Morrison immediately announced that the teachers and students in the classroom were ordered to leave the school buildings within 6:10 to 6:40, otherwise they would be considered "criminals" and would be fined three thousand yuan and imprisoned for six months.

Teachers and students protested the Hong Kong British police's unreasonable intimidation and continued to stay in the school buildings. At this time, Police Superintendent Morrison walked back and forth inside and outside the school buildings, sometimes explaining tasks to some police officers, sometimes whispering to some British police officers, and watching the group of Chinese journalists preparing to take news pictures in the school buildings.

    Starting the Violence, Like Wolves and Tigers

6:40 AM was the moment the British police began their violence. At this time, British Police Superintendent Morrison, who was in charge of directing the violence, first broke into the school building and threw away the mercury lamp power plug used by Xinhua News Agency reporter Huang Wenfang to shoot news films, as a signal to direct the police to commit violence. After the mercury lamp went out, Zhang Guangliang, a reporter from Ta Kung Pao, pressed the flash to take pictures. Three British police officers and four or five policemen immediately pounced on him and twisted Zhang Guangliang's hand together, and snatched the flash and camera he was using. The flash was broken on the spot, and the camera was also thrown to the ground and trampled on by the police. The wolf-like police punched and beat Zhang Guangliang's waist and abdomen with their fists and batons. He immediately shouted: "Protest against the use of violence!" "Protest against interference with the freedom of news coverage!" At this time, a police officer tightly strangled his neck with his arm, and another policeman covered his mouth to prevent him from shouting, and his breathing was about to suffocate, and his jaw was also scratched at this time. After Zhang Guangliang was beaten by the British police for a while, he was thrown out of the school gate.

While the police were beating Zhang Guangliang, Li Xiusheng, a reporter from Xin Wan Bao, was taking pictures of the police's violence. Three policemen immediately held him, one of whom used the camera strap to forcefully strangle his neck, and dragged and beat him out of the school building.

At the same time that the Hong Kong police were brutally beating Li Xiusheng, Huang Yonghe, a reporter from Wen Wei Po, stepped forward to take pictures again. Five or six policemen grabbed him, forcefully twisted his left hand behind his back, and beat him with batons and fists, and finally pushed him down the stone steps. When Xinhua News Agency reporter Huang Wenfang was filming the police beating reporters, he was immediately pushed, bumped, and beaten by several policemen until he was pushed out of the school building; the police also smashed Huang Wenfang's news film camera. Situ Qiang, another reporter from Xinhua News Agency, was holding a mercury lamp for photography at this time. When Police Superintendent Morrison saw it, he came forward fiercely to grab it. Later, because the reporter protested, he did not take it away. After that, a policeman grabbed Situ Qiang's shoulders and drove him out of the school gate.

    Driving Away Reporters, Committing Atrocities Again

At the same time, the five news reporters who stayed in the school buildings to conduct interviews were also pushed and squeezed out of the school buildings by the British police.

After the British police used violence to drive all the reporters out of the school gate, Police Superintendent Morrison immediately ordered the police to line up in three rows, blocking the gate, so that the reporters could not see the truth about the police's violence in the classroom.

According to the accusations of the teachers and students of Chung Wah Middle School who were beaten by the Hong Kong police, immediately after the police violently drove out the reporters, Police Superintendent Morrison rushed into the classroom and directed the police to commit violence against the unarmed teachers and students. Morrison walked behind Liang Zhiqiu, the director of teaching affairs who was sitting in the front row of students, and suddenly pulled away the chair Liang Zhiqiu was sitting on from behind, causing him to fall to the ground, and carded his neck with his hand. Two other policemen worked together to hold his hands and twist them backwards, while punching and kicking his waist, and pushing him down the stone steps, falling to the ground. Then Morrison carded teacher Deng Tongyuan's neck, making his breathing almost suffocate, and several policemen immediately stepped forward to punch and kick him. His glasses were also knocked off, and his elbows and palms were bruised and bruised.

The third person beaten out of the school by the British police was teacher Chen Guoquan, who was also twisted back by several policemen and punched and kicked. Several policemen were also howling like wild beasts: "Beat him to death!" "Kick him to death!" The watch on Chen Guoquan's hand was also snatched away by the police at that time. Subsequently, three other teachers, Chen Guoding, Chen Zong, and Zhang Zhenkun, were also beaten and thrown out of the school building in the same way.

After the Hong Kong police beat and threw away the above six teachers one by one, Morrison directed the police to pounce on the students. At that time, thirty-seven students were sitting in three rows, holding hands with each other. Morrison first pulled out students Liu Yuquan and Chen Xunqi. Liu Yuquan was twisted back by the police, beaten and pushed to the classroom door, and then kicked by the police's leather boots, and then thrown out of the school building. Chen Xunqi was also pushed out at the same time, and was also kicked by the police with leather boots.

    Young Girls Also Beaten

Subsequently, fourteen-year-old female student Chen Meishan, female student Yang Yuqing and male student Yuan Rusheng were also poisoned. A group of policemen rushed up and pulled away the chairs of Chen Meishan, Yang Yuqing and Yuan Rusheng from behind. They fell, but immediately stood up bravely. At this time, the police punched their arms and violently separated the arms the students were holding. Then they beat the students with fists, batons and leather boots, and pushed them out of the school building. When Yang Yuqing was pushed to the steps, she was lifted up and thrown on the stone steps by the police. Her cheeks were scratched and bleeding, and they are still red and swollen. There are four places on her back that were beaten until they were black and blue. She is still recuperating at home. Chen Meishan's arm was also sprained at the time, and she still feels very painful.

After that, more than twenty students were also forcibly pushed out of the classroom by the Hong Kong police with punches and kicks. Some of the students were carded by the police's necks and pushed hard, and several people fell in rows on the stone steps.

According to recent information, a total of twenty-nine people were beaten by the British police, including six teachers and school staff members Liang Zhiqiu, Deng Tongyuan, Chen Guoquan, Chen Guoding, Zhang Zhenkun, and Chen Zong; nineteen students Liu Yuquan, Chen Xiquan, Zhao Yaoling, Chen Xunqi, Jiang Yiqing, Xiong Dechao, Lu Jie, Wang Yongwei, Chen Zhiheng, Zhang Songen, Ding Zhiquan, Zeng Jintang, Yuan Rusheng, Chen Meishan, Yang Yuqing, Cai Kehua, He Liying, Tang Yingyuan, Liu Shuwei; four journalists Zhang Guangliang, Huang Yonghe, Li Xiusheng, and Huang Wenfang. Among them, ten people, including teachers and staff members Deng Tongyuan, Chen Guoquan, Chen Zong, students Yuan Rusheng, Chen Meishan, Yang Yuqing, Cai Kehua, He Liying, Tang Yingyuan, and journalist Zhang Guangliang, were injured.

    Mountain of Evidence, Useless Excuses

The time of the Hong Kong police's violence lasted from 6:40 AM to 7:00 AM. At this time, the British police forcibly sealed off the school buildings of Chung Wah Middle School with fire lacquer seals.

At 7:30 AM, Morrison led this group of police thugs and left Chung Wah Middle School.

The Hong Kong Chief Secretary's statement sophistically argued that the police "never used more than the minimum force necessary"; "apart from one journalist" who "suffered two minor abrasions, there is no other evidence to show that anyone was injured in the incident"; "nor is there any evidence to show that the police damaged any cameras". But no lie can erase the facts. The large amount of irrefutable facts provided by the personnel beaten and humiliated by the Hong Kong British police has once again exposed the hideous face of the Hong Kong British authorities to the world. It is futile for the Hong Kong British authorities to try to excuse themselves. The Hong Kong British authorities must punish the murderers, apologize, compensate for the losses, and guarantee that no more persecution incidents will occur.

    行凶岂容狡赖罪恶欲盖弥彰
    被殴辱的教师学生控诉香港英当局的暴行
    新华社香港1日电 被香港英国警察殴辱的中华中学教职员和学生纷纷向新华社记者控诉香港英国当局的暴行，用他们亲身经历的确凿的事实，有力地驳斥了香港英国当局29日就中华中学事件发表的狡辩声明。
    下面是被殴辱者控诉的香港英国警察行凶的真实情况：出动警察包围学校
    26日，凌晨五时四十九分，香港英国警察分由十部大型警车装载，还有几部私家车装载着一些便衣警察，由一部装有无线电设备的警车指挥，开到中华中学门外。然后，如临大敌地紧急布防，把中华中学严密包围。等到一百多个警察在外围布防妥当后，负责指挥的摩里逊警司就率领大批警员冲入学校的园地。
    下令封闭  驱逐师生
    在校舍内的中华中学师生四十四人，被香港英国警察的突袭行动所惊醒，他们一排排地静坐在校舍教室里，抗议英国警察用武力来封闭他们的校舍。接到学校方面电话通知，及时赶到的有十三个中国新闻记者，他们的职责是要把现场的真实情况向公众报道。他们在校舍和校园里分头进行采访。摩里逊警司进入学校后，向黄祖芬校长宣读“封闭令”，迫使校长接受，黄校长当即据理交涉。可是，摩里逊很不耐烦，还没有等黄校长说完话，就立即命令警员把黄校长和陪伴着他的颜焰新、黄凝镒两位教师押走，看守在一个小房间里，不让他们同教室里的师生接触。警察押走校长和两位教师后，摩里逊随即宣布，限令教室里的师生在六时十分至四十分内离开校舍，否则就算作“犯罪”，要受罚款三千元和监禁六个月的处分。
    教职员、学生抗议英国警察的无理恫吓，继续留在校舍内，这时，摩里逊警司在校舍内外走来走去，时而向一些警察交代任务，时而同一些英国警官耳语，并且注视着在校舍里准备拍摄新闻图片的一群中国记者。
    开始行凶　如狼似虎
    六时四十分，是英国警察开始行凶的时刻。这时，负责指挥行凶的英国警司摩里逊首先闯入校舍，一手将新华社记者黄文放用以拍摄新闻电影的水银灯电插头扔开，以此作为指挥警察行凶的讯号。水银灯熄灭后，大公报记者张光亮按动闪光灯拍照，三个英国警官和四、五个警察立即扑上去合力反扭张光亮的手，并把他使用的闪光灯和摄影机抢去，当场闪光灯被弄坏，摄影机也扔到地上，被警察用脚踩毁。如狼似虎的警察用拳头和警棍向张光亮的腰部和腹部猛打，他立即高呼：“抗议使用暴力！”“抗议干涉新闻采访自由！”这时，一个警官用手臂紧勒着他的脖子，另一个警察用手掩着他的嘴巴使他不能呼喊，呼吸濒于窒息，下额也在这时被抓伤。张光亮遭到英国警察一阵殴打后，被摔出校门外。
    在警察殴打张光亮的时候，新晚报记者李栩生正摄取警察行凶的照片，三个警察马上把他挟住，其中一个警察用照相机的皮带，用力勒着他的脖子，把他连拖带打地摔出校舍外。
    在香港警察凶殴李栩生的同时，文汇报记者黄永和又上前摄影，五、六个警察抓住他，将他的左手用力扭向背后，用警棍和拳头加以殴打，最后把他推下石阶。新华社记者黄文放在拍摄警察殴打记者的镜头，立即遭到几个警察的推撞、殴打，直到被推出校舍；警察还把黄文放的新闻电影机撞坏。新华社另一个记者司徒强这时正拿着摄影用的水银灯，摩里逊警司看见了就恶狠狠地前来争夺，后因记者抗议，没有夺走，其后，一个警察抓着司徒强的双肩，把他逐出校舍门外。
      赶走记者　再施毒手
    与此同时，逗留在校舍内进行采访的五个新闻记者，也先后被英国警察大力推挤，赶离校舍。
    英国警察用暴力把所有的记者驱逐出校舍门外以后，摩里逊警司就马上命令警察排成三列横排，阻隔着大门，使记者无法看到警察在课室内行凶的真相。
    据被香港警察殴打的中华中学师生的控诉，就在警察用暴力逐出记者以后，摩里逊警司随即冲入课室，指挥警察向手无寸铁的师生行凶。摩里逊走到坐在学生最前面的教导主任梁治球的背后，把梁主任坐着的椅子从背后突然用力拉走，使他跌倒地上，并用手卡着他的脖子，另外两个警察合力捉着他双手向后扭曲，一边向他的腰部拳打脚踢，一边把他推下石阶，摔倒地上。接着摩里逊用手卡着教师邓统元的脖子，使他呼吸几乎窒息，几个警察随即上前向他拳打脚踢，眼镜也被打落，手肘和手掌都被擦伤和呈现瘀痕。
    第三个被英国警察打出校舍的是教师陈国权，他也是被几个警察反扭着手，被拳打脚踢。几个警察还在一旁发出野兽般的嗥叫：“打死他！”“踢死他！”陈国权手上带着的手表当时也曾被警察抢去。随后，另外三个教师陈国定、陈综、张振坤也同样被殴打着摔出校舍外。
    香港警察把上述的六个教师逐个殴打和摔走后，摩里逊指挥警察向学生扑去。当时学生三十七人分坐成三排，互相手拉着手，摩里逊首先将学生刘钰泉和陈训岐两人拉出来，刘钰泉被警察反扭着双手，一边殴打一边推到课室门口，接着又遭到警察的皮靴乱踢，然后被摔出校舍。陈训岐同时也被推出来，并且也被警察用皮靴乱踢。
      年幼女生　亦遭殴打
    随后，十四岁的女学生陈美山、女生杨玉清和男生袁汝胜等人又遭毒手。一群警察拥上来从背后把陈美山、杨玉清和袁汝胜的椅子抽去，他们跌倒了，但又马上勇敢地站起来。这时，警察就用拳头打他们的手臂，并用暴力把学生们挽着的手臂分开。然后就用拳头、警棍和皮靴殴打学生，把他们推出校舍。杨玉清被推至台阶前时，又被警察掀起摔倒在石阶上，她的两颊被擦破流血，至今仍然红肿，她的背后有四处被打至瘀黑，现在她还在家里养伤。陈美山的手臂当时也被扭伤，至今仍觉得十分疼痛。
    其后，二十多个学生也相继被香港警察拳打脚踢地强力推出课室，其中有些学生被警察卡着脖子，用力猛推，几个人一排排地跌倒在石阶上。
    据最近了解，这次被英国警察殴打的共有二十九人，包括教师和学校职员梁治球、邓统元、陈国权、陈国定、张振坤、陈综六人；学生刘钰泉、陈喜泉、赵耀灵、陈训岐、江一清、熊德超、卢杰、王永伟、陈智衡、张松恩、丁志铨、曾锦棠、袁汝胜、陈美山、杨玉清、蔡可华、何丽英、汤应源、刘树伟等十九人；新闻记者张光亮、黄永和、李栩生、黄文放四人。其中，教师职员邓统元、陈国权、陈综、学生袁汝胜、陈美山、杨玉清、蔡可华、何丽英、汤应源和记者张光亮等十人受伤。
      罪证如山　狡赖无用
    香港警察行凶的时间从六时四十分开始一直到七时正才结束。这时，英国警察就用火漆封条强行把中华中学的校舍封闭。
    七时三十分，摩里逊率领着这群警察打手，离开了中华中学。
    香港布政司的声明诡辩说警方“始终未施用超过必须之最小武力”；“除记者一人”，“遭受两处轻微擦损之外，更无其它证据，显示任何人曾在该项事件中受伤”；“亦无证据显示警方曾损毁任何摄影机”。但是任何谎言都无法抹煞事实。被香港英国警察殴辱的人员提供的大量确凿的事实，使得香港英国当局的狰狞面目再度暴露于世。香港英国当局想要狡赖是徒劳的。香港英国当局必须惩凶、道歉、赔偿损失并保证不再发生迫害事件。
