Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing - The Ministry of Light Industry has decided to vigorously develop the silicate industry, using silicate raw materials to replace steel in the manufacture of light industrial equipment, in order to promote the Great Leap Forward in light industry.

The silicate industry includes the ceramics, glass, and enamel industries. From September 13th to 25th, the Ministry of Light Industry held a National Silicate Industry Conference in Nanjing, which determined that 1,200 ceramic paper-making machines, 2,000 ceramic alcohol distillation towers, and 500 ceramic oil extraction equipment would be produced this year. These three types of light industrial equipment alone can save the country more than 43,000 tons of steel.

In order to meet the needs of the nationwide leap forward in light industry, the Ministry of Light Industry proposed measures to replace steel with ceramics in the manufacture of light industrial equipment as early as July this year and designated Tangshan in Hebei, Yixing in Jiangsu, Shiwan in Guangdong, Jingdezhen in Jiangxi, Liling in Hunan, and Jinzhou in Liaoning as key areas for pilot production. After more than a month of hard work, more than ten important industrial machinery and equipment, such as ceramic paper-making machines, ceramic alcohol distillation towers, ceramic oil extraction equipment, ceramic ball bearings, ceramic rails, and glass perfume fractionators, have been successfully trial-produced, and some have already been put into production. The ceramic alcohol distillation tower manufactured by Yixing Ceramic Chemical Plant No. 3 has been installed in Changzhou Puliren General Factory, and the alcohol produced by this machine has a concentration of over 95 degrees. The successful trial production of the ceramic paper-making machine is an even more significant achievement. These ceramic factories are currently preparing to further trial-produce industrial production equipment with more complex structures and higher technical requirements, such as internal combustion engines.

Through the exchange of trial production experience from various regions, the conference unanimously agreed that silicate raw materials have become the "steel" in light industry, and the silicate industry will become the machinery manufacturing department of the chemical industry, light industry, food industry, and pharmaceutical industry, and should be vigorously developed. When developing this industry, it is first necessary to carry out a major technological revolution in existing silicate factories and rapidly expand production capacity. Before the first half of next year, the entire industry should achieve mechanization, semi-automation, and automation, changing the backward production methods that have existed for thousands of years. The conference believed that many gratifying achievements have been made in this regard in the first half of this year. For example, the wooden automatic blank pressing machine created by the ceramic industry has increased molding efficiency tenfold, and more than 1,000 new products have appeared. The automatic enamel firing furnace created by the enamel industry saves 30% of labor and increases output by two to three times. These new achievements have laid the foundation for the technological revolution in the silicate industry and for the development of cutting-edge products.

The conference believes that while using existing key silicate factories to mass-produce industrial equipment, it is also necessary to rely on the masses, rely on our own efforts, and build small silicate factories on a large scale, prioritizing indigenous methods before adopting foreign ones, to ensure that the broad masses of the people have access to the daily-use silicate products they need. People's communes in areas with suitable conditions can set up small ceramic and glass factories to mass-produce silicate daily-use products and refractory materials needed by the communes. When these factories are established in people's communes, the original silicate factories should actively provide technical and other assistance. Existing old factories should also vigorously develop satellite factories to promote the widespread development of the silicate industry.

A total of 380 representatives from 25 provinces, autonomous regions, and two cities attended the conference.

    硅酸盐原料——轻工业的“钢铁”
    轻工业系统决定大量制造陶瓷、玻璃设备
    据新华社南京电  轻工业部决定大力发展硅酸盐工业，利用硅酸盐原料代替钢铁制造轻工业设备，以促进轻工业的大跃进。
    硅酸盐工业包括陶瓷、玻璃、搪瓷三个行业。轻工业部9月13日到25日在南京召开了全国硅酸盐工业会议，确定今年内就要生产陶瓷造纸机一千二百台，陶瓷酒精蒸馏塔两千台，陶瓷油脂浸出设备五百台。仅这三种轻工业设备，就可以为国家节约钢铁四万三千多吨。
    为了适应全国轻工业全面跃进的需要，轻工业部在今年7月份就已经提出以陶代钢制造轻工业设备的措施，并指定河北唐山、江苏宜兴、广东石湾、江西景德镇、湖南醴陵、辽宁锦州等重点地区首先试制。经过一个多月的苦战，陶瓷造纸机、陶瓷酒精蒸馏塔、陶瓷油脂浸出设备、陶瓷滚珠轴承、陶轨、玻璃香料分馏器等十多种重要工业机械设备都先后试制成功，有的已经投入生产。宜兴陶瓷化工三厂制造的陶瓷酒精蒸馏塔，已安装在常州溥利仁综合工厂里，用这部机器生产的酒精浓度达九十五度以上。陶瓷造纸机的试制成功，更是一项重大的创举。这些陶瓷厂目前正在准备进一步试制内燃机等结构复杂、技术要求更高的工业生产设备。
    通过各地试制经验的交流，会议一致认为硅酸盐原料已成为轻工业中的“钢铁”，硅酸盐工业将成为化学工业、轻工业、食品工业和医药工业的机械制造部门，应当大力发展。发展这种工业时，首先要在现有的硅酸盐工厂中大搞技术革命，迅速扩大生产能力。明年上半年以前，全行业要实现机械化、半自动化和自动化，改变几千年来的生产落后面貌。会议认为，今年上半年在这方面已取得很多可喜的成就，例如陶瓷工业创造的木质自动压坯机，使成型效率提高了十倍，新产品出现了一千多种。搪瓷工业创造的搪瓷自动搪烧炉，节省劳动力30％，提高产量两倍到三倍。这些新成就为硅酸盐工业的技术革命、为向尖端产品发展打下了基础。
    会议认为，在利用现有硅酸盐重点工厂大量生产工业设备的同时，还必须依靠群众，自力更生，先土后洋地大办小型硅酸盐工厂，来保证广大人民对日用硅酸盐制品的需要。凡是有条件的地区，人民公社都可以办起小型陶瓷、玻璃厂，大量生产公社所需要的硅酸盐日用制品和耐火材料。在人民公社建立这些工厂时，原有的硅酸盐工厂应该积极给予技术等方面的帮助。现有老厂也应大力发展卫星厂，以促进硅酸盐工业遍地开花。
    参加这次会议的有二十五个省、自治区和两个市的代表共三百八十人。
