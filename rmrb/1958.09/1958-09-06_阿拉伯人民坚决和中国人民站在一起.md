　　Arab People Firmly Stand Together with Chinese People
　　Egyptian Peace Committee announces full support for the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan
　　Damascus newspapers say Arabs will use actions to express their sincere friendship to China
　　"Voice of Free Lebanon" radio station says US imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Lebanese people

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 4th - The Egyptian Peace Committee issued a statement today regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait, stating that we will not hesitate to support the Chinese people's recovery of their own territory and lost children with all the strength we possess.

　　The statement said: "Taiwan and nearby islands are not only usurped parts of Chinese territory, but have also become American barracks, threatening the security and freedom of the Chinese people."

　　The statement said that the provocations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and its instigator, US imperialism, have reached an intolerable level and are beginning to constitute a real threat to world peace.

　　The statement emphasized: "We Arab people greatly respect and love the great Chinese people. We will unhesitatingly support the heroic Chinese people. The Chinese people are our true friends, and they have proven this in our difficult times. We believe that China's policy is a policy of peace, friendship, and equality towards the people of all countries."

　　The statement said that the Peace Committee, on behalf of all peace-loving people, announced that they are ready to volunteer to support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan, Kinmen, and Matsu and the surrounding islands, because they fully understand that the Chinese people's struggle is also their struggle, and everyone's enemy is common.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 5th - Newspapers here on the 4th prominently published, with banner headlines, the part of President Nasser's speech on the 3rd regarding support for the Chinese people against American provocative activities in the Taiwan Strait. Many newspapers also published commentaries on this, expressing the Arab people's support for the Chinese people. The newspapers emphasized the importance of this mutual support in the anti-imperialist struggle.

　　"Al Ra'i Al-'Aam" published an editorial titled "Nationalist Struggle and China's Struggle," stating that in the Arab struggle to achieve their nationalist goals, the struggle against imperialism has led the Arab and Chinese people onto the same path of struggle. It said that during the tripartite aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, the Chinese people regarded defending Egypt and opposing the aggressors as their own struggle; in the period when Syria was threatened by aggression, the Chinese people believed that Syria's security was part of world security; and in the struggle against the US-British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, the Chinese people firmly stood on the side of Arab nationalism. The newspaper pointed out that, in this way, it is natural to launch a movement in Arab countries to support the Chinese people in their struggle for liberation and unification. Because the worldwide struggle for freedom is an indivisible unified action, participating in this struggle is the responsibility of everyone who demands liberation from imperialism and its forces.

　　"Al-Nasr" 's editorial said that President Nasser's remarks about the solidarity of Arab nationalism with China show that the Arab conscience is filled with sympathy and support for the great Chinese people.

　　It emphasized that everyone in the world who has principles of progress, justice, and freedom in their minds supports the attitude of the People's China, believing that the American attitude is an intolerable attitude against a great and noble nation. In history, this nation is known as the creator of wisdom, humanitarian and charitable teachings, and the building of virtue. How strange and needlessly provocative it is for the United States to insist on enslaving this great nation! All free people in the world stand with China against the United States, which is on its last legs and lacks morality in its policies and actions.

　　"Al-Alam" published an editorial titled "We Support China's Liberation Struggle," saying: "We Arab people should not remain silent on China's struggle to liberate Chinese islands. We must loudly support China and express our sincere friendship to the Chinese people."

　　The newspaper also said, "We will never forget People's China's support for Egypt during the Suez Canal War. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese people flocked to our embassy in Beijing, expressing their willingness to fight alongside us. We will also never forget the support China gave to Syria when it faced imperialist conspiracies and the gathering of Turkish and Baghdad Pact troops."

　　The newspaper concluded: "We support China's struggle, and the imperialists will hear our voice resounding throughout the Arab world."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 4th - The "Voice of Free Lebanon" radio station commented in its broadcast on the morning of the 4th that every honest Lebanese and every Arab hopes, if possible, to fly to China and fight the US imperialists together with the Chinese people.

　　The commentary said that Lebanese and all Arabs know very well that great China is strong enough to crush imperialist aggression, and the Chinese are prepared to defeat imperialism. The only assistance that Lebanese and all Arabs can give to China is to bravely fight against the American occupation of Lebanon. The commentary said: "Our struggle and China's struggle are one struggle, against one enemy, and that is the evil American imperialism. As long as we cooperate with all peace-loving people in the struggle here and in China, we can send imperialism to the grave."

　　The radio station pointed out that the Chinese people have always condemned the US-British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and have strongly supported the Lebanese and other Arab people's struggle against the aggressors.

　　The radio station also said, "Because the Chinese people and the Arabs are determined to liberate their countries from foreign aggressors, the Arabs regard the victories achieved by the Chinese people as their own victories, the victories of the Asian and African people, and the victories of all peace-loving people in the world."

　　The radio station emphasized that forcing the United States to withdraw its troops from Lebanon is an urgent task of Arab nationalism, and the withdrawal must be carried out immediately and unconditionally.

　　阿拉伯人民坚决和中国人民站在一起
　　埃及和平委员会宣布以全力支援中国人民解放台湾的斗争
　　大马士革报纸说阿拉伯人将用行动表示对中国的真诚友谊
　　“自由黎巴嫩之声”电台说美帝国主义是中黎人民共同敌人
    新华社开罗4日电　埃及和平委员会今天就台湾海峡局势发表声明说，我们将毫不犹豫地以我们所拥有的一切力量支持中国人民收回他们自己的领土和失去的子女。
    声明说：“台湾和附近的岛屿不仅是中国领土的被僭夺的部分，而且已经成为美国的兵营，威胁着中国人民的安全和自由。”
    声明说，台湾蒋介石集团和它的教唆者美帝国主义的挑衅达到了令人不能容忍的地步，开始构成了对世界和平的真正威胁。
    声明强调说：“我们阿拉伯人民非常尊敬和热爱伟大的中国人民。我们将毫不迟疑地支持英勇的中国人民。中国人民是我们真正的朋友，在我们困难的时期他们已经证明了这一点。我们相信中国的政策是和平、友好和对一切国家人民平等的政策。”
    声明说，和平委员会代表全体爱好和平的人士宣布：他们准备志愿支援中国人民解放台湾、金门和马祖以及周围岛屿的斗争，因为他们完全了解，中国人民的斗争也是他们的斗争，大家的敌人是共同的。
    据新华社大马士革5日电　此间报纸4日都以通栏大标题突出地刊载了纳赛尔总统在3日发表的演说中关于支持中国人民反对美国在台湾海峡进行挑衅活动的部分。许多报纸还就此发表评论，表示阿拉伯人民对中国人民的支持。报纸强调这种互相支持在反帝斗争中的重要性。
      “舆论报”以“民族主义的斗争和中国的斗争”为题发表社论说，在阿拉伯争取达到他们的民族主义目的的过程中，反对帝国主义的斗争使得阿拉伯人和中国人民走上同一条斗争的道路。它说，在英法以三国发动侵略埃及战争的期间，中国人民曾经把保卫埃及、反对侵略者的斗争当作他们自己的斗争；在叙利亚受到侵略进攻的威胁的时期，中国人民认为，叙利亚的安全是世界安全的一部分；而在反对美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的斗争中，中国人民坚决地站在阿拉伯民族主义的一边。报纸指出，这样，在中国人民的解放和统一的斗争中，在阿拉伯国家中发动支援中国人民的运动就是很自然的事。由于全世界争取自由的斗争是不能分割的统一行动，参加这一斗争是每一个要求从帝国主义及其势力之下解放出来的人的责任。
      “胜利报”的社论说，纳赛尔总统关于阿拉伯民族主义同中国团结一致的谈话表明了阿拉伯人的良心对伟大的中国人民充满同情和支持。
    它强调说，世界上每一个头脑中有进步、正义和自由原则的人都支持人民中国的态度，认为美国的态度是反对一个伟大而崇高的民族的不能容忍的态度。在历史上，这个民族是以智慧、人道和慈善的教导和美德大厦的创建者著称的。美国坚持奴役这个伟大民族是多么奇怪和好事寻衅！世界所有自由的人们都是与中国站在一起反对美国的，后者正在日暮途穷，在它的政策和行动上都缺乏道义。
    “旗帜报”以“我们支持中国的解放斗争”为题发表社论说：“我们阿拉伯人民对于中国解放中国岛屿的斗争不应该保持沉默，我们必须大声支持中国，表示我们对中国人民的真诚友谊。”
    这家报纸又说，“我们永远不会忘记人民中国在苏伊士运河战争期间对埃及的支持。数十万中国人涌向我国驻北京的大使馆，表示愿意同我们共同战斗。我们也绝不会忘记中国在叙利亚面临帝国主义阴谋、面临土耳其和巴格达条约军队的集结时所给予叙利亚的支持。”
    这家报纸最后说：“我们支持中国的斗争，帝国主义者将听到我们的呼声响遍阿拉伯世界。”
    新华社大马士革4日电　“自由黎巴嫩之声”电台4日上午在广播中评论说，每一个正直的黎巴嫩人和每一个阿拉伯人都希望，如果能够的话，飞到中国去同中国人民一起打击美帝国主义者。
    评论说，黎巴嫩人和所有的阿拉伯人都很知道，伟大的中国是强大得足以粉碎帝国主义的侵略的，中国人准备击溃帝国主义。黎巴嫩人和所有的阿拉伯人所能给中国的唯一援助是英勇地打击美国对黎巴嫩的占领。评论说：“我们的斗争和中国的斗争是一个斗争，反对一个敌人，那就是罪恶的美国帝国主义。只要我们和所有爱好和平的人民在这里和在中国的斗争中进行合作，就能把帝国主义送进坟墓。”
    这家电台指出，中国人民一直谴责美英对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略，并且大力支持黎巴嫩和其他阿拉伯人民反对侵略者的斗争。
    这家电台又说，“因为中国人民和阿拉伯人都坚决要从外国侵略者手中解放它们的国家，阿拉伯人把中国人民所取得的胜利看作是他们自己的胜利、亚非人民的胜利、全世界所有爱好和平人民的胜利”。
    这家电台强调，迫使美国从黎巴嫩撤退它的军队，是阿拉伯民族主义的迫切任务，撤军必须立即无条件地进行。
