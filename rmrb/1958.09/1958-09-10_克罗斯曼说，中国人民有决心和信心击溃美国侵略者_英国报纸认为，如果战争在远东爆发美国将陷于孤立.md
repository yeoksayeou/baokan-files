Xinhua News Agency, London, September 9th: British Labour MP Richard Crossman published an article in the "Daily Mirror" today, describing how he personally saw the Chinese people sincerely hoping for peace, but determined and full of confidence to defeat American aggressors and defend their revolution. Crossman said that the Chinese side also warned that if the American army gets involved in purely Chinese affairs, then the sole responsibility for causing the war will be borne by the American government.

Crossman said, I pray that "Americans do not underestimate these warnings, thinking they are just empty threats."

Crossman said that from his conversations with Chinese soldiers and his visits to industrial cities and rural areas, he saw the same sentiment everywhere: the Chinese all believe that if a war breaks out, the American paper tiger will be exposed.

He wrote: "Only when I personally see this situation now do I realize how Anglo-American China policy is based on pure self-delusion and a refusal to face the reality of the Chinese Communist revolution."

Crossman asked Britain to persuade Eisenhower "to voluntarily give up what he will sooner or later be forced to give up. Eisenhower must be made to realize that if he involves his country in a war with China, the Americans will not win."

Crossman is currently in Beijing. In summarizing the Chinese policy on the Taiwan area he learned in Beijing, he wrote: "Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal for negotiations proves that China hopes for peace. He also gave President Eisenhower the opportunity to get out of a completely untenable situation without losing face."

Xinhua News Agency, London, September 8th: The Executive Committee of the British National Union of Mineworkers today issued a statement condemning the provocative actions of the United States in the Taiwan Strait. This union, representing 700,000 miners, also demanded that the British government guarantee not to be dragged into any adventure in the Far East, and called for the restoration of the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, London, September 9th: Some British newspapers sharply criticized the United States' military adventurism of openly violating Chinese territorial waters in the Jinmen and Xiamen areas with its warships.

The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" published an editorial today saying: "Immediately after the United States and China agreed to hold ambassadorial talks to discuss the crisis between them, American naval vessels immediately sailed into the range of artillery forces on the Chinese mainland. This is the most blatant provocative action."

The newspaper pointed out that the United States' military provocative actions will not be supported by its allies. The newspaper said, "If a crisis breaks out in Chinese waters, the United States itself will suffer irreparable damage. And in the eyes of most people in the world, even America's allies, the United States looks like it is deliberately trying to provoke a showdown."

The "Scotsman" said on the 8th that if the United States conducts a war "on territory that undeniably belongs to China," "the United States will be completely isolated" and this war will be a "disastrous mistake."

　　克罗斯曼说，中国人民有决心和信心击溃美国侵略者
　　英国报纸认为，如果战争在远东爆发美国将陷于孤立
    新华社伦敦9日电　英国工党议员理查德·克罗斯曼今天在“每日镜报”上发表文章，描述他亲眼看到的中国人民真诚希望和平，但是决心地和充满信心地要击溃美国侵略者和保卫他们的革命的情况。克罗斯曼说，中国方面也提出警告，如果美国军队卷入纯粹的中国事务中去，那么引起战争的唯一责任将要由美国政府来负担。
    克罗斯曼说，我祈求“美国人不要轻视这些警告，认为它们只是虚声恫吓。”
    克罗斯曼说，从他同中国士兵们的谈话以及他访问工业城市和农村的情况看来，他到处看到同一样的情绪：中国人都相信，如果爆发战争的话，美国纸老虎将被戳穿。
    他写道：“只有当现在我亲自看到这种情况时，我才认识到目前英美的中国政策是如何以纯粹的自我幻想和拒绝面对中国共产党革命的现实为基础的。”
    克罗斯曼要求英国说服艾森豪威尔“自动地放弃他早晚将被迫放弃的事情。必须设法使艾森豪威尔认识到，如果他使他的国家卷入同中国的战争的话，美国人是不会打胜仗的。”
    克罗斯曼现在正在北京。他在就台湾地区局势综述他在北京得知的中国政策情况时写道：“周恩来总理建议谈判证明中国是希望和平的。他还使艾森豪威尔总统有机会可以不丢面子地摆脱完全站不住脚的处境。”
    据新华社伦敦8日电　英国全国矿工联盟执行委员会今天发表声明，谴责美国在台湾海峡的挑衅行为。这个代表七万矿工的联盟并且要求英国政府保证不被拖入在远东的任何冒险行动，并且呼吁恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位。
    据新华社伦敦9日电　英国一些报纸尖锐抨击美国军舰在金门、厦门地区公然侵犯中国领海的军事冒险行动。
    自由党的“新闻纪事报”今天发表社论说：“美国和中国刚同意举行大使级会谈来讨论它们之间共同的危机以后，美国海军舰只就立即驶入中国大陆上的炮兵部队射程范围以内。这是最无耻的挑衅行动。”
    这家报纸指出，美国的军事挑衅行动是不会得到它的盟国的支持的。报纸说，“如果中国海面爆发危机，美国本身也会遭到无可弥补的损害。而在世界大部分人士看来、甚至美国的盟国看来，美国看起来像是故意要引起摊牌”。
    “苏格兰人报”8日说，如果美国“在不可否认地属于中国的领土上”进行战争，“美国将完全孤立”，而且这个战争将是一个“灾难性的错误”。
