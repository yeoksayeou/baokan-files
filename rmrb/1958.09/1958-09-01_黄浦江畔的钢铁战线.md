　　The Steel Front on the Banks of the Huangpu River
　　Written collectively by our Shanghai-based reporters
    At the end of August, an intense battle to seize steel from time was expanding on the banks of the Huangpu River. In the hearts of millions, the sparks of steel flashed. "Seize the last five days of August," "Seize the last four days"... In recent days, newspapers have been reporting steel-related news with such eye-catching headlines. This news has drawn factories involved in manufacturing smelting equipment and power generation equipment, transportation units, stores, and even residents of quiet neighborhoods into the struggle for steel.

    On the Main Offensive Position
    On the morning of the 28th, reporters visited the open hearth workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3.

    On the roof truss in front of the No. 2 open hearth furnace, a red flag marking excellence was flying. In the workshop, the workers of the two open hearth furnaces were engaged in a fierce competition to produce steel quickly. From the 23rd to the 27th, new records appeared one after another in Furnace No. 1 and Furnace No. 2, and the red flag had changed hands several times between the two. Two hours and fifty-three minutes to refine one furnace – this was the latest record created by Furnace No. 2 on the 27th. Eight thousand eight hundred tons was the common goal of the two open hearth furnaces this month, and time became their common wealth. Therefore, when one open hearth furnace was charging materials, the workers of the other furnace would automatically run over to help. Workers in the pig iron melting, steel pouring, and material transportation sections also closely coordinated from all links. Office staff delivered meals to the workshop, and the workshop Party branch secretary and the chairman of the workshop trade union, among others, slept in the workshop office at night. This workshop has always been the holder of the highest utilization coefficient record for open hearth furnaces in the country. In the first four days of the last week of August, the open hearth utilization coefficient had reached a new peak of 16.787 tons of steel produced per square meter of furnace bottom per day.

    Stepping into the shipbuilding workshop of Hudong Shipyard, one could see at a glance twelve tall converter shells standing in this huge workshop. Cold work workers were carrying out assembly work in a tense manner, and welders were welding the "meridians" around the converter. The shipbuilding workshop was no longer living up to its name, and most of its strength had been invested in the task of manufacturing converter equipment.

    "With steel, there are ships!" The factory listed the manufacture of smelting equipment as the top priority overriding all other tasks in the factory. The factory stipulated that all production in the factory must be subordinate to "steel" and must not stand in its way. In the past two months, almost 70% to 80% of the factory's equipment and personnel have been invested day and night in the struggle to "fight for steel."

    The manufacture of the converter shell was undertaken by the Tang Zhifu production team. In July, this team completed a total of four. At this speed, the twenty-seven furnace shells of the twelve sets of converters would have to be manufactured by next year. The factory transferred thirty fitters and welders to provide support, and adopted a flow-line operation method. Now, on average, a furnace shell can be built in less than two days.

    The Shanghai Alloy Steel Plant, which is preparing to put into production on September 1, is carrying out the final installation work these days in a tense manner.

    These days, it has become very difficult for reporters to conduct interviews here. From the municipal party secretary, district party secretary, minister, bureau chief, to the factory party committee secretary and factory director, some have gone down to the grassroots level to inspect work, and some have simply moved into the factory.

    Thousands of inspection team cadres have spread out in hundreds of factories throughout the city. This is not an ordinary inspection; in a sense, it is somewhat like a work team during wartime. They moved into the factory and ate, lived, and labored with the workers, learning from the workers on the one hand, and understanding the situation and discovering problems on the other, helping with the work. Cadres being on the front line has become a major feature of the current situation.

    The Flanks of the Steel Front
    On the 28th, at the pier on the banks of the Huangpu River, the heavy rain that began before dawn had not stopped. The "Peace No. 24" freighter, which had come from Dalian to carry pig iron for Shanghai factories to make steel, was almost submerged in the misty rain. In the past, in such bad weather, loading and unloading at the pier would have been forced to stop; but now, the roar of cranes, trailers, and heavy trucks never stopped for a minute, and loading and unloading were proceeding as usual.

    At five o'clock in the morning, one hour before work, the forty-three workers responsible for loading and unloading this batch of pig iron had already arrived at the pier.

    As soon as people climbed into the tall cabins, they found it too cumbersome to operate in raincoats and threw them off. The burly and strong Li Jindi and Ju Guangcheng simply took off their shirts and worked bare-chested.

    The forty-three workers were divided into three groups to load and unload in three cabins. The workers in the first and third cabins calculated that they could empty the cabin of pig iron by eleven o'clock. The pier stipulated that ten o'clock was their lunch time. Someone suggested, "Don't eat until it's unloaded," and others shouted "Good" in response. The driver who was driving the trailer on the shore then responded as well. Everything for time, they were fighting for every minute!

    After several hours of intense labor in the heavy rain, forty-three people unloaded one thousand and twenty-one tons of pig iron from the ship. Large trucks and barges on the river continuously transported the pig iron to the steelmaking factories. In the evening, this pig iron will be put into steelmaking furnaces to produce molten steel.

    The climate in Shanghai now is slightly cool in autumn, and the dockworkers do not notice it when loading and unloading. Gao Jinyun, an advanced producer in Shanghai, wearing wet clothes, said to reporters with a slight tremor in his voice: "The steel mills are waiting for pig iron, what does it matter if we are a little cold, a bowl of ginger soup will warm us up." At this time, the ginger soup prepared by the pier cafeteria cooks for them had been carried to the ship barrel by barrel.

    These days, freighters carrying pig iron from Dalian arrive in Shanghai Port every day. Whether it is day or night, sunny or rainy, the dockworkers are sticking to their posts.

　　黄浦江畔的钢铁战线
　　本报驻上海记者集体采写
    8月底，一场向时间争钢的紧张战斗在黄浦江畔扩展。千万人的心中闪动着钢铁的火花。“抓紧8月份最后五天”、“抓紧最后四天”……连日来，报纸用这样醒目的标题报道着有关钢铁消息。这些消息，把制造冶炼设备、发电设备有关的工厂、交通运输单位、商店甚至僻静里弄的居民都卷进钢铁的斗争中去了。
    在主攻阵地上
    28日上午，记者访问了上钢三厂平炉车间。
    二号平炉炉前的屋架上，一面标志优胜的红旗在飘扬着。车间里两座平炉的工人，快速炼钢的竞赛正在激烈进行。从23日到27日，新纪录在一号炉二号炉连接出现，红旗已在双方数度易手。二小时五十三分炼一炉，这就是27日由二号平炉创造的最新纪录。八千八百吨是两座平炉这个月的共同目标，时间成了他们共同的财富。因此，一座平炉加料，另一座炉的工人就会自动跑去帮忙。化铁炉、浇钢、运料等部分的工人，也从各个环节紧紧配合上来。科室人员把饭菜送到车间，车间党总支书记、车间工会主席等人夜里就睡在车间办公室。这个车间一直是全国平炉利用系数最高纪录的保持者。8月最后一周的前四天，平炉利用系数已达到每天每一平方公尺炉底产钢十六点七八七吨的新高峰。
    走进沪东造船厂的造船车间，极目一望，矗立在这座巨大车间里的是十二只高大的转炉炉壳。冷作工人紧张地进行着装配，电焊工正在焊接转炉周身的“筋脉”，造船车间已经名不符实，大部分力量都投入了转炉设备的制造任务。
    “有钢才有船！”厂里把制造冶炼设备列为全厂压倒一切的首要任务。厂部规定：全厂任何生产都要服从“钢”，不得挡路。近二个月，全厂几乎经常有70％—80％的设备和人员日日夜夜的投入了“为钢而战”的斗争中。
  制造转炉炉壳是汤志福生产小组担负的。7月份，这个组共完成了四只。按照这个速度，十二套转炉的二十七只炉壳，要制造到明年。工厂抽调了三十名装配工、电焊工来支援，采取流水作业法，现在平均不到二天就能造出一只炉壳。
    准备9月1日投入生产的上海合金钢厂，这几天正在紧张地进行最后的安装工作。
    这几天，记者想在这里采访，已成为一件十分困难的事情。从市委书记、区委书记、部长、局长、直到工厂的党委书记和厂长，有的下基层检查工作，有的干脆搬进了工厂。
    数千检查团的干部，已在全市成百上千的工厂中撒开来。这不是平常的检查，在某种意义上倒有点像战争时期的工作队的样子。他们搬进厂里和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，一面向工人学习，一面了解情况、发现问题，帮助工作。干部身临前线，这已成为当前形势的一大特点。
    钢铁战线侧翼
    28日，在黄浦江边的码头上，黎明前开始的大雨一直没有停止，从大连载来上海工厂炼钢用的生铁的“和平二十四号”轮，几乎淹没在迷蒙的雨雾中。往常，在这样恶劣的天气里，码头的装卸是要被迫停止的；而现在，起重机、拖车、载重大卡车的轰鸣声一分钟也没有闲歇，装卸在照常进行着。
    清晨五点钟，离上班还有一小时，负责装卸这批生铁的四十三个工人已经来到码头上。
    人们一爬进高大的船舱，就嫌穿着雨衣操作太碍事，把雨衣也摔开了。身体魁梧强健的李金弟、居广成索性连上衣也脱掉，赤膊干。
    四十三个工人是分成三小组在三个船舱里装卸的。第一和第三舱的工人一合计，十一时可以把舱里生铁都卸空。码头上规定十点钟是他们吃中饭的时间。有人提出：“不卸完不吃饭”，别的人连声叫“好”，在岸上开拖车的司机接着也响应。一切为了时间，他们在争取每一分钟！
    经过几小时大雨中的紧张劳动，四十三人从船上卸下了一千零二十一吨生铁。大卡车和江上的驳船源源把生铁运往炼钢工厂。晚上，这些生铁就将投入炼钢炉炼出钢水。
    上海现在的气候已微露秋凉，码头工人在装卸时是不觉察的，一完工就感到冷了。上海市先进生产者高金云穿着湿透的衣服，声音有些打颤地对记者说：“炼钢厂等着生铁用，我们冷一些算得什么，吃一碗姜汤就暖和了。”这时，码头食堂炊事员为他们准备的姜汤，已一桶桶抬到轮船上。
    这些日子里，每天都有从大连载运生铁的轮船到达上海港。不论是白天还是深夜，天晴还是下雨，码头工人都坚守着自己的岗位。
