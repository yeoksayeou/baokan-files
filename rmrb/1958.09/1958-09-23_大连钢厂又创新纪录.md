    大连钢厂又创新纪录
    据新华社旅大22日电高举电炉炼钢红旗前进的大连钢厂，21日又创造了冷装电炉利用系数（电炉的变压器百万伏安一昼夜的产钢吨数）五六点五九三的全国最高纪录，大大超过了它在17日创造的利用系数五十一点二的纪录。这一昼夜，用高速度炼出的钢，质量良好。
    大连钢厂8月份的日平均利用系数是二八点五九三，居全国的首位。21日创造的纪录和8月份的水平比较，电炉的产量已经猛跳了一倍。这一天，刘洪喜领导的炼钢小组仅用一小时三十八分，就炼出了一炉优质钢。
    这个厂炼钢车间门口，现在贴满了炼钢工人的大字报。他们的豪语是“真金不怕火炼，英雄不怕困难，有成绩不骄傲，继续整装向前！”由于连续发射“卫星”，这个厂在1日到20日的二十天中，已经完成了9月份全月钢产量跃进计划的76.2％。
