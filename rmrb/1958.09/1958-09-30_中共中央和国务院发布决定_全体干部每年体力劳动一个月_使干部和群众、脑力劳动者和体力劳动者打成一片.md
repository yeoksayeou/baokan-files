    Decision of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on Cadres Participating in Physical Labor
    (Issued September 25, 1958)
    Since the CCP Central Committee issued the instructions on May 10, 1957, regarding leaders at all levels participating in physical labor and the instructions on February 28, 1958, regarding sending cadres to lower levels for labor training, nearly one million cadres nationwide have been sent to rural areas and industrial and mining enterprises to participate in physical labor. At the same time, the vast number of cadres nationwide have actively participated in various physical labor activities during their spare time. This has greatly enhanced the connection between the Party, government, army, people's organizations, and many enterprises and institutions with the working masses, and effectively improved the ideological work style of cadres. Because cadres participate in physical labor, appearing among the masses as ordinary laborers, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been further improved, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people has been enhanced, and their trust and love for cadres has been strengthened. This is an important factor in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country this year. The facts of the past year or so have proven that cadres and the masses, intellectual workers and manual workers, must be integrated and can be integrated. Any neglect or doubt about this is wrong and dangerous. At present, there are millions of state cadres, plus their families numbering in the tens of millions. Their thoughts and lifestyles affect all aspects of national life. Making this contingent completely integrated with the working masses has very important political significance. Therefore, the CCP Central Committee and the State Council believe that in addition to some cadres already being sent to rural areas and industrial and mining enterprises for labor training, in the future, all cadres in office should mainly spend a certain amount of time each year participating in industrial and agricultural labor production. Now it is decided:
    1. All staff members of all agencies, troops, enterprises, and institutions, except those who are old and sick and unable to participate in physical labor or can only participate in light physical labor, must spend at least one month each year participating in physical labor.
    2. Each unit should formulate plans and make arrangements based on the specific conditions of each unit regarding how its staff members participate in physical labor and how to ensure that at least one month is completed, so as to quickly implement the above decision without affecting work.
    3. The Party committees and people's committees at all levels should conduct two comprehensive inspections of the participation of cadres at their respective levels in physical labor in June and December each year, respectively, in order to ensure the complete implementation of this decision.

    中共中央和国务院发布决定
    全体干部每年体力劳动一个月
    使干部和群众、脑力劳动者和体力劳动者打成一片
    新华社29日讯  中共中央  国务院关于干部参加体力劳动的决定
    （一九五八年九月二十五日发布）
    自中共中央1957年5月10日发布关于各级领导人员参加体力劳动的指示和1958年2月28日发布关于下放干部进行劳动锻炼的指示以后，全国有近百万干部下放到农村和工矿企业参加体力劳动，同时，全国广大在职干部利用业余时间积极地参加了各项体力劳动，这样，大大地增强了党、政府、军队、人民团体以及很多企业、事业机关同劳动群众的联系，有效地改进了干部的思想作风。由于干部参加体力劳动，以普通劳动者的面貌在群众中出现，因而进一步改善了干部和群众之间的关系，提高了广大劳动群众的革命积极性，加强了他们对于干部的信任和爱戴。这是形成我国今年工农业生产大跃进的一个重要因素。一年多以来的事实证明，干部和群众、脑力劳动者和体力劳动者必须打成一片，也能够打成一片，对于这一点的任何忽视和怀疑都是错误的和危险的。目前国家干部队伍有几百万人，加上他们的家属有几千万人，他们的思想、生活作风影响着国家生活的各个方面，使这个队伍完全同劳动群众打成一片就具有非常重大的政治意义，因此，中共中央和国务院认为除了一部分干部已经下放到农村和工矿企业进行劳动锻炼以外，今后主要应当使全体在职干部每年都分出一定时间去参加工农业劳动生产。现在决定：
    一、各机关、部队和各企业、事业单位的全体工作人员，除年老有病不能参加体力劳动或者只能参加轻微的体力劳动的以外，每人每年必须用至少一个月的时间参加体力劳动。
    二、各单位对于所属工作人员怎样参加体力劳动和怎样保证作满至少一个月，应当根据各单位的具体情况，定出计划，作好安排，以便在不影响工作的条件下迅速执行上述决定。
    三、中共各级党委和各级人民委员会应当在每年的6月和12月分别对本级干部参加体力劳动的情况作两次全面的检查，以便保证这一决定的完满实施。
