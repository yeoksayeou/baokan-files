Xinhua News Agency, London, 22nd - The Executive Committee of the Scottish Mineworkers' Union, with 70,000 members, passed a resolution today demanding that "American troops withdraw from the Taiwan area."

The resolution stated that the U.S. threat to use nuclear weapons is a step that could lead to a third world war.

The Scottish Mineworkers' Union Executive Committee unanimously passed a decision to hold anti-war demonstrations nationwide and called on its 130 branches to actively participate in these demonstrations.

In Wales, the Llanelli Trades Council passed a resolution protesting U.S. interference in China's internal affairs. The council also requested that the Trades Union Congress hold a special meeting to discuss the deteriorating situation in the Far East.
