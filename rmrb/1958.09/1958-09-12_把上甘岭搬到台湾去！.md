Move Shangganling to Taiwan!
The third batch of Chinese People's Volunteers is about to begin their withdrawal today. Welcome back in victory, dearest brothers! You are steel warriors defending world peace, the first to puncture the American paper tiger. Now, this scarred and tattered paper tiger is intent on acting as a burial object for Chiang Kai-shek, mobilizing its fleet to conduct intimidation in the Taiwan Strait, attempting to make Kinmen and Matsu its grave.

Dearest brothers, your return is perfectly timed. If the American madmen do not quickly pull back from the brink, daring to impose war on the Chinese people, then please move Shangganling to Taiwan first! You are very skilled at puncturing paper tigers; MacArthur learned that lesson a few years ago. Let today's what's-his-name Bickley and Smott learn the lesson too, if they can handle it.

Dearest brothers, welcome back in victory! The motherland needs you in every post. The cultural revolution and technological revolution are heading towards a climax, expecting you to promote even greater leaps forward. The steel marshal has ascended the throne, and machines on horseback are also advancing rapidly; they especially welcome steel warriors, the most beloved brothers who are fully mechanized.

The war against nature requires even greater courage; the three-year task of changing the face of the land still requires hard work. The achievements of Shangganling can be unfolded everywhere, and we need to overcome difficulties in all aspects.

Welcome back in victory, dearest brothers! You Wu Songs who fight tigers have returned at just the right time.

I want to say it again, if the American madmen are not reconciled, then please move Shangganling to Taiwan first!

    把上甘岭搬到台湾去！
    郭沫若第三批志愿军撤军今天又要开始，欢迎你们胜利归来，最可爱的兄弟，你们是保卫世界和平的钢铁战士，戳破美国纸老虎，你们是第一次。现在这个满身创疤的破纸老虎，却又存心充当蒋介石的殉葬者，调动舰队在台湾海峡进行恫胁，想把金门马祖作为自己的坟墓。最可爱的兄弟，你们回来得正好。如果美国狂人不赶快悬崖勒马，胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，那就先请把上甘岭搬到台湾去吧！戳破纸老虎，你们是很熟练的，麦克阿瑟在几年前曾经领过教；让今天的什么比克利和斯摩特，也领领教吧，只要他们吃得消。最可爱的兄弟，欢迎你们胜利归来！祖国在各个岗位上都需要你们；文化革命和技术革命正走向高潮，期待着你们促进更大的跃进。钢铁元帅已经升上了宝座，机械跨上骏马也在一日千里；他们特别地欢迎钢铁战士，充分机械化了的最可爱的兄弟。对于自然的战争需要更大的勇敢，改变面貌的三年任务尚待苦干；上甘岭的战绩随地都可以展开，我们需要克服任何方面的困难。欢迎你们胜利归来，最可爱的兄弟！打虎的武松你们回来得正是适时。我要再说一遍，如果美国狂人不死心，那就先请把上甘岭搬到台湾去！
