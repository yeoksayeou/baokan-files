　　Transplantation of Seawater Fish to Inland Lakes
    Zhangbei, Shangdu, Kangbao, Guyuan and Shangyi five counties belonging to Zhangjiakou Prefecture in Hebei Province, are distributed with many "Shuinau" (inland lakes), most of the water quality is saline or brackish water, and the area of the lakes totals 400,000 to 500,000 mu. These water surfaces have been abandoned for a long time without being utilized. Now, more than 400,000 mullet fry have been transferred from Tianjin and Qinhuangdao for stocking. This is a pioneering work in raising mullet in Shuinau.

　　海水鱼移殖内湖
    河北张家口专区所属张北、商都、康保、沽源、尚义五县，到处分布有很多“水淖”（内陆湖），水质大部是咸水或半咸水，淖的面积共有四、五十万亩。这些水面长期荒废，未加利用，现在已由天津、秦皇岛调运鮻鱼苗四十多万尾进行放养，这是水淖养鮻鱼的创举。
