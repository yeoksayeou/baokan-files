    On the Special Express Train
    Zhang Jiong, Peking University

    The Provincial Governor and the General sat face to face by the train window. These old comrades-in-arms gazed at the morning scenery outside: the lush, green fields of crops, covered with a layer of milky white morning mist.

    The General had just returned from Korea and accepted the Governor's invitation to visit his province. In the General's words, he was going there to see another kind of battle – an earth-shattering battle against nature. Ten years ago, he and the Governor had served together in the same column; the Governor was the political commissar, and he was the commander. They had fought against Huang Botao and Du Yuming on this vast Huaihai Plain...

    "Comrade passengers, who wants a newspaper?" Suddenly, a young girl appeared in the aisle of the carriage, her face flushed, a little shy, but striding forward, one hand holding a stack of magazines, the other holding newspapers: "Today's Daily, anyone?"

    "I'll take one," the General called out.

    The girl came up to him, and only then did the General see a Peking University badge pinned to her chest. He paused, feeling puzzled.

    But the headline on the newspaper immediately attracted him.

    After the General finished reading the newspaper, he handed it to the Governor. He looked up and saw the girl from before. She was holding a rag, carefully and attentively wiping the coffee tables in turn. Soon, it was the General's turn. She generously picked up the fruit plate, wiped the table clean, and, meeting the General's gaze, was no longer as shy as before.

    "Are you a student at Peking University?" the General couldn't help but ask.

    "Yes, we are going to the South for practical training."

    "Are you studying railways?"

    "No, I'm studying geology." Seeing the General's surprised expression, the girl quickly added, "Today we decided to do voluntary labor and help the train attendants with some tasks."

    The Governor was clearly also interested in the girl, and, like a kind father, pulled the girl to sit beside him and asked, "When do you graduate?"

    "Next summer."

    "Good, we need geological personnel very much. Those mountains should all be awakened to leap forward!" Anything the Governor said became witty and humorous. He turned to the General and said, "Old Han, don't think she's just a girl. You, this old scout, might have to give way to her. Hey, she's the cutting-edge soldier of this era."

    The General laughed heartily.

    "Old Han, if your Xiaoling were here, she'd be in university too!" Looking at the girl's simple, beautiful, big eyes, the Governor couldn't help but recall the lost little daughter of Battalion Commander Han in the distant war years. She also had such a pair of lovely big eyes. But the Governor was afraid of arousing his comrade's long-faded sorrow, so he quickly stopped himself.

    The girl looked at the General in surprise, and everyone fell silent.

    Suddenly, someone ran over and shouted to the girl, "Hurry, hurry, your program is scheduled first."

    The girl quickly said to the Governor and the General, "We are going to organize a broadcast performance for the passengers."

    The General suddenly seemed to remember something. He picked up a large, red apple from the plate on the coffee table and handed it to the girl: "Here, have an apple, a reward for your labor."

    "No, no, thank you." The girl put down the apple, hurriedly picked up the rag, and skipped away with the young man.

    特别快车上
    北京大学　张烱
    省长和将军面对面坐在车窗前。这一对老战友凝望着窗外的早晨：庄稼茂盛的田野，绿油油的，弥盖着一层乳白色的晨曦。
    将军刚从朝鲜归国，应省长的邀请到他的省份去做客，按将军的说法是上那儿去看看另一种战斗——对自然界的惊天动地的大战。十年前，他和省长曾在一个纵队共事过，省长是政委，他是司令员。他们曾在这广袤的淮海平原上打过黄伯韬、杜聿明……
    “旅客同志们，谁看报纸？”忽然车厢里的过道上出现了一位年轻姑娘，脸蛋红红的，有些羞怯，但却迈着大步，一手挟一叠杂志，一手扣着报纸：“今天的日报，谁要？”
    “我要一份。”将军招呼道。
    姑娘来到他的跟前，将军这才看见她的胸襟上别着一枚北京大学的校徽，怔了一下，不觉纳闷起来。
    但报纸上的标题立即把他吸引住了。
    将军看完报，把它递给省长。抬头又见到刚才的姑娘。他拿着抹布，正挨次专心致意地擦着茶几。一会儿，就轮到将军的面前，她大方地拿起水果盘，擦净几子，迎着将军的目光，不再像刚才那么羞涩了。
    “你是北京大学的学生吗？”将军忍不住问。
    “是的，我们到南方实习去。”
    “你是学铁路的？”
    “不，我是学地质的。”姑娘见将军露出惊疑的神情，忙补充了一句：“今天我们决定义务劳动，帮助列车员做些事。”
    省长显然也对这姑娘发生了兴趣，像个慈祥的父亲那样，拉姑娘在旁边坐下来，问：“你几时毕业？”
    “明年夏天。”
    “好呀，我们太需要地质人员了，那些大山都该唤醒它们跃进啦！”任什么话到省长嘴里都变得风趣横生，他回头对将军说：“老韩，别瞧她是个女孩子，你这位老侦察兵可要让位给她啦，嘿，人家才是这个时代的尖兵呢。”
    将军哈哈大笑起来。
    “老韩，你的小玲要是在，也上大学啦！”省长望着姑娘朴实的美丽的大眼睛，不禁忆起了遥远的战争年代韩旅长失落了的小女儿，她也有那么一对叫人喜爱的大眼睛。但是省长怕勾起战友久已淡漠了的哀伤，赶忙止住了口。
    姑娘惊异地望了一眼将军，大家都沉默了。
    忽然有人跑来朝姑娘喊道：“快走，快走，你的节目排在第一个”。
    姑娘连忙对省长和将军说：“我们要给旅客们组织一次广播演出呢。”
    将军突然想起什么似的，从茶几的盘子里拣起一只又大又红的苹果，塞到姑娘手里：“来，吃一个，奖励你的劳动”。
    “不，不，谢谢。”姑娘放下苹果，慌忙拾起抹布，蹦跳着跟小伙子走了。
