Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station broadcast on the 25th that, while the French colonial government continues a bloody war in Algeria and De Gaulle continues to play the "referendum" trick, fierce battles are taking place in Algeria. These battles show that the Algerian people's struggle will only end after complete independence is achieved.

The broadcast said that the news of the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic has been warmly welcomed throughout the country in recent days. In the pastures of the herders, in large and small cities, the Algerian people are celebrating the establishment of their own government. The people are actively and enthusiastically implementing the orders and instructions of the provisional government's local governments. In this way, in recent days, with the support of the people, the Algerian National Liberation Army has carried out four ambushes against the French colonial army, causing significant losses to the colonial army.

The struggle against the "referendum" in the cities is developing smoothly. The French army is on alert throughout Algeria, and French troops are attacked every day.

The French colonial army's Foreign Legion has suffered heavy losses in recent years. Since the beginning of this year, thousands of Foreign Legion soldiers have defected to the National Liberation Army with all their weapons and equipment, in order to be repatriated to their own countries.

The French professional army, especially the paratrooper units, has suffered heavy blows recently. Casualties in some units have been as high as 50%.

However, the National Liberation Army has grown from 5,000 to 130,000. The National Liberation Army units are currently very successful in attacking French motorized and armored units. French bunkers, which were very difficult to destroy in the past few years, are now easily subdued by the National Liberation Army's mortar and bazooka fire. More than one French military aircraft is shot down every day.

All the Algerian people recognize the provisional government as its legitimate representative. Conversely, they consider the French army as a colonial occupation force that should be completely driven out of Algerian territory.

Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: TASS, Paris: Algeria began a "referendum" on De Gaulle's draft "constitution" on the 26th. The "referendum" will continue for three days.

However, the voting will not take place simultaneously during these three days; temporary polling stations in many areas will hold voting on one day of these three days. According to "La Croix," this approach is taken for "security considerations," because the voting is conducted under the supervision of the army, but the army "cannot protect all polling areas at the same time."

According to Parisian newspapers, almost the entire Algeria was placed under martial law on the eve of the vote. Residents in some areas were ordered to stay put, while residential areas where voting was to begin on the 26th were surrounded by French troops.

"Le Nouvel Observateur" published an instruction issued on July 12th by General Salan, the French government's delegate-general and military commander-in-chief in Algeria, stipulating that "everyone" among the Algerian local residents should be "included" in the electoral lists, and emphasized that the French army "should strive for the maximum number of votes in support of the draft constitution proposed by General De Gaulle."

"Le Nouvel Observateur" compared various official documents and concluded that despite all the coercive methods, "1.5 million Algerians – one-third of all Algerian voters – have not been registered on the electoral lists." This weekly emphasized that all this overturned the claims of the official propaganda machine, which insisted that the Algerian National Liberation Front's call for residents to boycott the "referendum slogan" had failed.

    反对戴高乐的殖民宪法
    阿民族解放军发动大规模伏击
    法国当局正用刺刀导演“公民投票”丑剧
    据新华社26日讯  阿尔及利亚共和国之声电台25日发表广播说，正当法国殖民政府在阿尔及利亚继续着一场血腥战争和戴高乐还在玩弄“公民投票”骗局的时候，在阿尔及利亚正进行着猛烈的战斗。这些战斗表明阿尔及利亚人民的斗争只有在完全获得独立后才会结束。
    广播说，最近几天以来，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府成立的消息在全国各地受到热烈的欢迎。在牧民的牧场中，在大小城市里，阿尔及利亚人民都在庆贺自己政府的成立。人民积极和热情地执行临时政府各地方政府的各项命令和指示。就这样，最近几天中，在人民的支持下，阿尔及利亚民族解放军对法国殖民军队进行了四次伏击，使殖民军队遭到重大的损失。
    城市中反对“公民投票”的斗争正在顺利发展。法国军队在阿尔及利亚各地都处于戒备状态中，法军每天都遭到袭击。
    法国殖民军队的外籍兵团几年来损失惨重。从今年开始以来，已经有上千的外籍兵团士兵携带全副武器和装备跑到民族解放军方面来，以便能够被遣返自己的国家。
    法国的职业军队，特别是伞兵部队，在最近遭到了痛击。某些部队的伤亡高达50％。
    但是，民族解放军却已经从五千人壮大到十三万人。民族解放军部队在目前非常成功地袭击法军的摩托化和装甲部队，过去几年中十分难于攻毁的法军碉堡，现在已经很轻易地被民族解放军的迫击炮和火箭筒火力所制服。现在每天都要击落法军飞机一架以上。
    全体阿尔及利亚人民都承认临时政府是它的合法代表，相反地，他们认为法国军队是一支殖民主义占领军，这支军队应该全部从阿尔及利亚土地赶出去。
    据新华社27日讯  据塔斯社巴黎讯：阿尔及利亚26日起开始就戴高乐“宪法”草案进行“公民投票”，“公民投票”要继续三天。
    但是，这并不是在这三天中同时举行投票；许多地区的临时投票站是在这三天中的一天进行投票。据“十字架报”报道，采取这种办法是出于“保证安全的考虑”。因为投票是在军队的监督下进行，但是军队“不能同时保护所有投票区”。
    据巴黎报纸报道，几乎整个阿尔及利亚都在投票前夕宣布了戒严。一些地区的居民接到命令要留在原地，而那些26日要开始投票的居民区都被法军包围起来。
    “法兰西观察家”周刊发表了法国政府驻阿尔及利亚总代表兼军事总司令萨兰将军7月12日发布的一个指示，规定要把阿尔及利亚当地居民“每个人都列入”选举名单，并且强调指出，法国军队“应争取最大数量的选票支持戴高乐将军提出的宪法草案”。
    “法兰西观察家”周刊比较了各种官方文件，并得出结论：尽管采取了种种强迫方法，“有一百五十万阿尔及利亚人——占阿尔及利亚全体选民的三分之一——没有在选民名单上登记”。这家周刊强调指出，这一切推翻了官方宣传机关的说法。官方宣传机关硬说，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线呼吁居民抵制“公民投票的口号破产”。
