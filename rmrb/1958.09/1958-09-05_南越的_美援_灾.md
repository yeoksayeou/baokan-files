　　The "American Aid" Disaster in South Vietnam
　　Le Shan
　　In order to plot new wars in the Far East and obstruct the reunification of Vietnam as stipulated by the Geneva Accords, American imperialism has turned South Vietnam into its military base and a new type of colony for the past four years.
　　An important means by which the United States carries out economic control and political manipulation of South Vietnam is through "American Aid."
　　According to South Vietnamese official statistics, from 1955 to 1957, the total amount of "American Aid" for three years was 750 million U.S. dollars, of which more than 65% was for military expenditures.
　　The United States, through the "American Aid Mission," controls all departments of South Vietnamese activities. The "American Aid Mission," headed by Barus, occupies one of the most spacious and modern buildings in Saigon, from where it issues orders and monitors everything. The activities of the "American Aid Mission" not only involve overall plans and policies but also manage specific details, such as decisions on imported goods, the allocation of foreign exchange to import enterprises, and so on.
　　Every department in South Vietnam has American "advisors." They have seized all effective power. The extent to which South Vietnam is controlled by the United States can also be seen from the confession of Ngo Dinh Nhu, brother of Ngo Dinh Diem. Ngo Dinh Nhu said at a press conference in Saigon: "No one has ever consulted Vietnam on what Vietnam needs. People dump all sorts of things on Vietnam, stuffing Vietnam's throat full. They force Vietnam to accept goods from any country." (Note: The Vietnam referred to by Ngo Dinh Nhu refers to South Vietnam under the control of American imperialism.)
　　"American Aid" has brought unparalleled disasters to South Vietnam. Under the control of the "American Aid Mission," South Vietnam's foreign trade has experienced huge deficits year after year. According to official documents from the South Vietnam National Bank, South Vietnam's trade deficits in recent years are as follows: (Unit: million South Vietnamese currency)
　　　　　　1955　　1956　　1957
　　Imports　9,212　7,374　10,098
　　Exports　2,415　1,579　 2,781
　　Deficit　6,797　5,795　 7,317
　　The trade policy under the control of the "American Aid Mission" encourages the import of consumer goods. In recent years, more than 80% of South Vietnam's annual imports have been consumer goods, while machinery and other production equipment account for only about 5% of the total import value.
　　The large-scale import of consumer goods has led to stagnation in production. In the first quarter of 1958, South Vietnam had a stockpile of 37 million meters of various textiles. Of the 15,038 textile machines, 10,520 have been forced to stop working. Four hundred and eighty out of six hundred sugar refineries have closed down. Due to the embargo, rubber exports have suffered difficulties. However, the United States has forced South Vietnam to purchase 3,165 tons of American-made synthetic rubber, worth more than 5 million U.S. dollars. As a result, the price of South Vietnamese rubber has fallen from 30 South Vietnamese currency per kilogram in October 1957 to 20 South Vietnamese currency per kilogram in May 1958.
　　Production stagnation, commercial depression, and the number of unemployed people are constantly increasing. According to Saigon newspapers, out of South Vietnam's population of over 12 million, about one million people are unemployed.
　　The people of South Vietnam, living under the shadow of unemployment, are also subjected to extortionate taxes and levies, and their lives are in dire straits. In 1955, each person bore a tax burden of 520 currency units; in 1958, this increased to 725 currency units, an increase of 39%. At the same time, the purchasing power of the people has greatly declined. According to the South Vietnam "Commerce Department Magazine," compared to the early days of the restoration of peace, the people's purchasing power has decreased by 80%.
　　"American Aid" has also severely undermined South Vietnam's national industry and commerce. Saigon newspapers frequently reveal the tragedies of South Vietnamese industrialists and businessmen committing suicide under the disaster of "American Aid." At the beginning of this year, a small businessman soaked his clothes in gasoline and burned himself to death. On May 16, a businessman in Dike (Cholon) committed suicide by drowning in a river due to bankruptcy.
　　The "American Aid" disaster in South Vietnam is prompting more and more people in the South to respond to the call of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, demanding the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords, the holding of general elections, and the restoration of national unity, because they recognize that only by ending the colonial rule of American imperialism, achieving national independence, and realizing national reunification can they have a happy life.

### 南越的“美援”灾

　　南越的“美援”灾
    乐山
    美帝国主义为了在远东策划新的战争和阻挠日内瓦协定所规定的越南的重新统一，四年以来，已经把南越变成了它的军事基地和新型的殖民地。
    美国对南越进行经济控制、政治操纵的一个重要手段就是“美援”。
    根据南越官方的统计数字，1955年至1957年，三年中，“美援”总数为七亿五千万美元。其中65％以上为军事用费。
    美国通过“美援使团”控制了南越的一切活动部门。以巴罗斯为首的“美援使团”，占用了西贡最宽敞、最现代化的建筑物之一，从那里发号施令，监视一切。“美援使团”的活动不仅涉及总的计划、方针，而且还管理具体的细节，例如进口货物的决定，对进口企业外汇的分配等等。
    南越各个部门里都有美国“顾问”。他们攫取了一切有效的大权。南越受美国控制的情况，从吴庭艳的兄弟吴庭儒的自供里也看得出来。吴庭儒在西贡一次记者招待会上说：“从来没有人就越南所需要的东西，征求过越南的意见。人们把各色各样的东西向越南倾销，把越南的喉咙塞满了。他们迫使越南接受来自任何国家的货物。”（按：吴庭儒所谓的越南，系指美帝国主义操纵下的南越。）
    “美援”给南越带来了无比的灾难。在“美援使团”操纵下的南越对外贸易，年年发生巨大逆差。根据南越国家银行的官方文件，南越最近数年贸易逆差如下：（单位：百万元南越币）
          1955　  1956　  1957
　　输入　9，212　7，374　10，098
　　输出　2，415　1，579　2，781
　　逆差　6，797　5，795　7，317
    在“美援使团”控制下的贸易政策是鼓励消费品的输入。最近几年南越每年的进口货物，80％以上为消费品，生产用的机器等，仅占进口总值的5％左右。
    消费品的大量输入造成了生产停滞。1958年第一季度，南越积存的各类纺织品已达三千七百万公尺。一万五千零三十八台纺织机，已有一万零五百二十台被迫停工。六百家炼糖厂已有四百八十家歇业。由于禁运，橡胶输出遭受困难。但是美国却强迫南越购进了三千一百六十五吨美国人造橡胶，价值在五百万美元以上。结果南越橡胶价格由1957年10月每公斤南越币三十元跌至1958年5月每公斤二十元。
    生产停滞、商业萧条，失业人数不断增加。据西贡报纸估计，在南越的一千二百多万人口中，约有一百万人失业。
    在失业阴影中的南越人民，又受到苛捐杂税的压榨，生活陷于绝境。1955年每人担负的捐税为五百二十元，1958年，增为七百二十五元，即增加了39％。同时，人民的购买力大大地下降，据南越“商务部杂志”估计，与和平恢复的初期比较起来，人民的购买力下降了80％。
    “美援”也严重地摧残了南越的民族工商业，西贡报纸不时透露在“美援”灾祸下，南越工商业者自杀的悲剧。今年年初，一个小商人用汽油浸湿了衣服，自焚而死。5月16日，堤岸的一个商人，由于破产投河自杀。
    南越的“美援”灾正在促使愈来愈多的南方的人民响应越南民主共和国政府的号召，发出了正确实施日内瓦协定、进行普选、恢复国家统一的要求，因为他们认识只有结束美帝国主义的殖民统治、完成民族独立、实现国家统一，才会有幸福的生活。
