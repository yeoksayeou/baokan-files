Those present applauded and shouted "Correct! Correct!" for a long time.

    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，只有国家强大，只有人民团结一致，只有政权巩固，才可能发出像给美国总统艾森豪威尔这样的信。赫鲁晓夫说，苏维埃政权比任何时候都巩固。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，“社会主义国家之间的友谊是我们威力的伟大源泉。”赫鲁晓夫表示相信，今后仍然有条件来加强各国人民之间的友好和为和平而斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到将在苏共第二十一次代表大会上通过的七年发展国民经济控制数字时说，这些数字将引起世界正直的人们莫大的欢欣。
    赫鲁晓夫同志是为了祝贺斯大林格勒州提前完成向国家交售一亿五千万普特粮食的社会主义义务而到斯大林格勒的。和赫鲁晓夫同来的有勃列日涅夫、基里钦科、科兹洛夫。苏联领导人在11日这天还访问了斯大林格勒水电站建设工程，参观了水力工程建设者的城市——伏日斯基。
