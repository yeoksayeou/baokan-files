    Announcing Good News
    Li Yiqing, General Manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company
We are steel workers, fighting to build a new steel base! For the past hundred years, the night has been dark, and we have been bound in shackles. Our predecessors dreamed of steel, but their aspirations were difficult to achieve. With the sound of gunfire, the earth was rejuvenated, banners were unfurled, and tens of thousands of people rejoiced. The Communist Party shines like a satellite in the sky. The great leap forward in agriculture brings joyful news of new records every day. The steel marshal takes command, and large, medium, and small enterprises combine to surge forward with the force of a thousand horses. The momentum is magnificent, shaking heaven and earth. Who says that ten million tons is impossible? The whole Party runs steel, the whole people run steel, and small blast furnaces fill the cities and countryside. Our Wuhan Iron and Steel workers express their feelings: “Heaven may be great, and earth may be great, but nothing can compare to our determination! Produce iron early, produce steel early, and let iron and steel converge into the Yangtze River! Today we have realized our vows; No. 1 blast furnace has produced iron ahead of schedule.” Let us cheer for the victory of steel and announce the good news to the people of the whole country!

    报喜
    武汉钢铁公司总经理　李一清我们是钢铁工人，为建设新的钢铁基地而斗争！过去一百年，黑夜沉沉，枷锁满身，我们的前人，想过钢铁，有志难成。一声炮响，大地回春，旌旗招展，万人欢腾，共产党像卫星一样闪耀天空。农业大跃进，新纪录天天动人听闻。钢铁元帅升帐，大中小结合万马奔腾，气壮山河，震动乾坤。谁说一千万吨不可能？全党办钢铁，全民办钢铁，小高炉布满了城市和乡村。我们武钢工人表心情：“天说天大，地说地大，甚么
  也比不了我们的决心大！提早出铁，提早出钢，让铁钢汇成长江！今天我们实现了誓言，一号高炉提早出铁。”让我们欢呼钢铁的胜利，向全国人民报喜！
