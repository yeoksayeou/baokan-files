Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd. Pyongyang newspapers today published a talk by Korean Premier Kim Il-sung on August 28th with Czech Radio and Television Committee Chairman Nechasek and Vice-Chairman Uravitz on the achievements of socialist construction in Korea and the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea.

Kim Il-sung said that in the ten years since the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Korea has undergone tremendous changes. All the working people of Korea are carrying out socialist construction with soaring enthusiasm.

The plan was overfulfilled in its entirety in the first year of the first Five-Year Plan (1957-1961). Last year, the total industrial output value increased to nearly three times that of 1949, an increase of 44% compared with 1956; the total industrial output value in the first half of this year increased by 34% compared with the same period last year. In agriculture, 3.2 million tons of grain were produced last year, an increase of 400,000 tons compared with before the war. At present, the socialist transformation of agriculture has been almost entirely completed. As of the end of June this year, the cultivated land area owned by agricultural cooperatives accounted for 99.1% of the total cultivated land area.

Kim Il-sung said that the Korean working people are advancing at high speed in all sectors of the national economy. They are determined to complete the first Five-Year Plan one and a half years ahead of schedule, in 1960. This year's national grain production plan is 3.3 million tons. Farmers have overcome this year's severe drought, and it is estimated that grain production can exceed the plan by 400,000 tons. Kim Il-sung said that during the Five-Year Plan, housing construction in urban and rural areas can exceed 7 million square meters, reaching a total of 25 million square meters. Due to the vigorous development of man-made fibers, each person in northern Korea can receive 12 meters of fabric this year, and in 1960, they can receive more than 28 meters, while before the war, each person only had one meter.

When Kim Il-sung talked about the prospect of the peaceful reunification of Korea, he said that the central slogan put forward by the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland is: all foreign troops, especially US troops, must withdraw from South Korea.

Kim Il-sung said, "We advocate: in order to lead the Korean armistice to a consolidated peace, do not transport weapons into Korea, and actively support the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. We have done so. However, the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique drove the inspection team of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission out of South Korea, transported new weapons, and continued to blatantly violate the important provisions of the armistice agreement." He pointed out that now the Chinese People's Volunteers have withdrawn, but the US troops continue to remain in South Korea and are attempting to threaten the Korean people with atomic weapons.

Kim Il-sung said that the characteristic of the current situation in South Korea is that the broad masses of people are aware that the only way out is the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and the trend among them against US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique and yearning for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland is growing.

Kim Il-sung said, "Our struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland is arduous. However, the Korean people will surely achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland through persistent and unremitting struggle."

Kim Il-sung said that when imperialists and modern revisionists are carrying out vicious conspiracies to undermine the unity between socialist countries and fraternal parties, the parties and people of Korea and Czechoslovakia resolutely struggled to further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp with the Soviet Union as the core, and held even higher the banner of proletarian internationalist friendship and unity.

Kim Il-sung said, "We will be loyal to the 1957 Moscow Declaration and contribute everything to its realization. Based on the spirit of the Moscow Declaration, there is no doubt that the proletarian internationalist friendship and unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of Korea and Czechoslovakia will be further strengthened in the future."

Kim Il-sung said that during the war and after the war, the Czechoslovak people assisted the Korean people, and Czechoslovakia, as a member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, made contributions to the cause of maintaining peace in Korea. Kim Il-sung said that in the future, the people of Korea and Czechoslovakia should further support each other and learn from each other in economic, cultural, and other fields.

    金日成首相强调指出
    朝鲜人民必将实现祖国和平统一
    不容美国违反停战协定　美军必须撤出南朝鲜
    新华社平壤3日电　平壤报纸今天发表了朝鲜内阁首相金日成在8月28日向捷克斯洛伐克电台和电视委员会主席内查塞克和副主席乌拉维茨发表的关于朝鲜的社会主义建设成就和朝鲜的和平统一问题的谈话。
    金日成说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国创建十年来，朝鲜起了巨大的变化。朝鲜全体劳动人民正以冲天的干劲进行着社会主义建设。
    在第一个五年计划（1957——1961年）的头一年中全部超额完成了计划，去年的工业总产值增加到将近1949年的三倍，比1956年增加了44％；今年上半年的工业总产值比去年同期增加了34％。农业方面，去年生产了三百二十万吨谷物，比战前增加了四十万吨。目前几乎已经全部完成了农业的社会主义改造。截至今年六月底为止，农业社所有的耕地面积占总耕地面积的99.1％。
    金日成说，朝鲜劳动人民在所有国民经济部门都以高速度前进。他们决心提前一年半在1960年完成第一个五年计划。今年的国家粮食产量计划为三百三十万吨，农民们战胜了今年严重的旱灾，预计粮食产量可以超过计划四十万吨。金日成说，在五年计划内城市和农村的住宅建设可以超额七百万平方公尺，即共达到二千五百万平方公尺。由于大力发展人造纤维，今年朝鲜北部每人可以分得织物十二公尺，到1960年就可以分得二十八公尺以上，而战前每人只有一公尺。
    金日成谈到朝鲜的和平统一的展望时说，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府为了祖国的和平统一，提出的中心口号是：一切外国军队特别是美国军队撤出南朝鲜。
    金日成说，我们主张：为了把朝鲜停战导向巩固的和平，不要向朝鲜境内运进武器，并且要积极支持中立国监察委员会的工作，我们是这样做了。但是，美帝国主义者和李承晚集团却从南朝鲜把中立国监察委员会视察小组撵走，运进新型武器，继续粗暴地违反停战协定的重要条款。他指出，现在，中国人民志愿军已经在撤退，但是美国军队继续留在南朝鲜，还企图用原子武器威胁朝鲜人民。
    金日成说，南朝鲜目前局势的特点是：广大人民觉悟到只有和平统一祖国才是出路，在他们中间反对美帝国主义和李承晚集团而向往祖国和平统一的趋势日益发展。
    金日成说，我们和平统一祖国的斗争是艰巨的。但是，朝鲜人民通过顽强不懈的斗争，必将实现祖国的和平统一。
    金日成说，当帝国主义者和现代修正主义者进行恶毒的阴谋企图破坏社会主义国家和兄弟党之间的团结的时候，朝捷两国的党和人民为了进一步加强以苏联为核心的社会主义阵营的团结坚决进行了斗争，更加高高地举起了无产阶级国际主义友谊团结的旗帜。
    金日成说，我们将忠于1957年莫斯科会议宣言，并且为它的实现而贡献出一切。基于莫斯科会议宣言精神，毫无疑问，今后朝、捷两党、两个国家和两国人民之间的无产阶级国际主义的友谊团结将得到进一步的加强。
    金日成说，在战时和战后，捷克斯洛伐克人民援助了朝鲜人民，捷克斯洛伐克作为中立国监察委员会的成员国对维护朝鲜和平的事业作出了贡献。金日成说，今后，朝捷两国人民要在经济、文化等各方面进一步相互支持、相互学习。
