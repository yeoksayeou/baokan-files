Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 6th. The Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongcun Township, Huang County, Shandong Province, has created a high-yield record of 27,312 jin of corn per mu. This exceeds the corn yield record of 25,715 jin per mu from the Xiejixiang People's Commune in Shangqiu County, Henan Province, by 1,597 jin.

This 1.05 mu corn experimental plot was cultivated jointly by Jiang Songshan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Huang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Liu Guangtai and Yu Jinrun of the County Party Committee's work group stationed in the Guangming Cooperative, along with ten others. Zeng Dongming and others from the Shandong Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences' work group stationed in Huang County also actively participated in the management.

This cornfield was deep-plowed to a depth of three chi, and irrigated once after the thaw in spring, applying 130,000 jin of base fertilizer. The varieties planted were "Golden Queen" and "Chunza No. 2," using nutrient pot seedlings. Throughout the entire growing season, the corn encountered severe drought, with no rainfall. Thanks to the meticulous management of Jiang Songshan and the other ten people, the field was irrigated a total of eighteen times, with four artificial rainfalls. Fertilizer was applied each time water was used, totaling 420 jin of chemical fertilizer, 2,000 jin of dry ash, and 100,000 jin of man-made urine. Four foliar sprays of phosphorus were also administered. The corn stalks grew to a height of one zhang, as thick as hoe handles, and the ears were over one chi long, bigger than a club.

On August 29th, those who participated in the acceptance inspection included Zhang Ming, First Secretary of the Huang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Secretary Jiang Songshan, Yang Xindong, Secretary of the Zhongcun Township Party Committee, and Zeng Dongming of the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, totaling sixteen people.

    玉米亩产27312斤
    新华社济南6日电　山东黄县中村乡光明农业社一块玉米田创造了亩产玉米二万七千三百一十二斤的高产纪录，它比河南省商丘县谢集乡人民公社的玉米亩产纪录二万五千七百一十五斤还多出一千五百九十七斤。
    这块一亩零五厘玉米试验田，是中共黄县县委书记处书记姜松山和县委驻光明社工作组刘广太、于金润等十人共同培育的，省农业科学研究所驻黄县工作组的曾东明等人也积极参加了管理工作。
    这块玉米田曾深翻三尺，开冻后春灌一遍，施基肥十三万斤。播的“金皇后”与“春杂二号”品种，用营养钵育苗。玉米整个生长期遇到酷旱，滴雨未落，由于姜松山等十多人的精心管理：先后共浇水十八次、人工降雨四次，每次浇水都追肥，共追化肥四百二十斤、干灰二千斤，人造尿十万斤，根外喷磷四次。玉米生长的秸高一丈，粗如镢柄，穗长一尺多，赛过大棒棰。
    8月29日参加验收的，有中共黄县县委第一书记张明、书记姜松山、中村乡党委书记杨新栋和省农业科学研究所曾东明等十六人。
