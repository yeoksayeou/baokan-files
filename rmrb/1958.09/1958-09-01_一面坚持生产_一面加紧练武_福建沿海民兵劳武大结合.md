Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 30th -- The Fujian coastal area militia "combines labor and military affairs," persisting in production under artillery fire on one hand, and accelerating the improvement of combat skills on the other, closely cooperating with the People's Liberation Army to defend the coast.

Fujian coastal militia have significantly improved their military skills in the struggle against the enemy on the sea frontier. With the help of the coastal defense troops, they engage in both production and military training, with "fields as training grounds and beaches as classrooms," rapidly improving their military skills while completing production tasks. The militia of Cheng County and Cheng Township all achieved "excellent" results in a recent live ammunition shooting assessment. Many militiamen are not only "repeatedly hitting targets with continuous bursts" with rifles, but have also become "all-round marksmen" proficient in several types of guns and artillery. In addition to mastering shooting skills, female militiamen have also learned military knowledge of bandaging and rescuing the wounded.

The heroic Dongshan Island militia once cooperated with the People's Liberation Army in July 1953 to defeat the invasion of more than 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, victoriously defending their hometown and the coast. Now, the shooting skill level of this powerful militia has reached an overall rating of "excellent," producing a large number of "bullseye every time" sharpshooters, and possessing good tactical skills in cooperating with coastal defense troops in combat. The Jiaocheng Township militia team in Ningde County, under the slogan of "double leap forward in production and training," is both a production shock brigade and a military training hero team. They utilized their noon and field labor rest time, diligently studying and training hard for fifteen days, and finally achieved an overall "excellent" score in rifle shooting for the entire militia team. In a recent live ammunition shooting exercise, the Nanzhen militia team in Fuding County had forty-six out of ninety-five people as top-grade shooters. Militia members Ji Tianzhu, Ji Tianwen, and Ji Tianshi launched a competition in production and training, and as a result, all excellently completed their production tasks and became top-grade shooters. They said: "If the enemy dares to come and make trouble, our three brothers guarantee to take care of a platoon!"

The heroic militia teams on Dadan Island and Xiaodeng Island, located opposite Jinmen Island occupied by Chiang's bandit troops, are even more vigilant. On one hand, they are leading the masses to persist in production under artillery fire, and on the other hand, they are actively cooperating with the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense troops in standing guard, keeping watch, and conducting coastal patrols.

### 一面坚持生产　一面加紧练武  福建沿海民兵劳武大结合

    一面坚持生产　一面加紧练武
　　福建沿海民兵劳武大结合
    新华社福州30日电　福建沿海地区的民兵“劳武结合”，一面在炮火下坚持生产，一面加紧提高战斗本领，密切配合人民解放军保卫海防。
    福建沿海民兵在海防对敌斗争中军事技术有显著提高。他们在海防部队的帮助下，边生产、边练武，“田头是操场，海滩是课堂”，在完成生产任务的同时，迅速提高了军事技术。成县成乡的民兵在最近一次实弹射击考核中，都获得了“优秀”的成绩。许多民兵不仅打步枪“连发连中”，而且已成为精通几种枪炮武器的“全能射手”。女民兵们除了掌握射击技术以外，还学会了包扎和救护伤员的军事常识。
    英雄的东山岛民兵，在1953年7月曾配合人民解放军打垮了一万多蒋军海盗的进犯，胜利地保卫了家乡和海防。现在，这支强大的民兵队的射击技术水平已达到总评“优秀”，出现了大批的“百发百中”的神枪手，并且对配合海防部队作战具有良好的战术水平。宁德县蕉城镇的民兵队在“生产、训练双跃进”的口号下，既是生产突击队，又是练武英雄队，他们利用中午和田间劳动的休息时间，人人勤学苦练十五天，终于取得了全民兵队步枪射击总评“优秀”的成绩。福鼎县南镇民兵队在最近一次实弹射击中，九十五人中有四十六人是优等射手。民兵纪天柱、纪天文和纪天士三兄弟在生产和练武中展开了一场竞赛，结果都出色地完成了生产任务，也都成了优等射击手。他们说：“如果敌人敢来捣乱，我们三兄弟保证收拾它一个排！”
    处在蒋贼军盘踞下的金门岛对面的大嶝岛和小嶝岛上的英勇民兵队，更加提高警惕，一面带领群众在炮火下坚持生产，一面主动地配合解放军海防部队站岗放哨，进行海防巡逻。
