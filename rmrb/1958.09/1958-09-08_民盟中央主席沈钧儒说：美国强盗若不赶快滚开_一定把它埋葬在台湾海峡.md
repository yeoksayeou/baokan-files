　　People of the China Democratic League Chairman Shen Junru said:
    If the American robbers don't get out quickly, they will surely be buried in the Taiwan Strait Comrades! Compatriots!
    Not long ago, we held a conference here to protest against the unreasonable interference of imperialism in the Middle East. Now, the American robbers have not yet rolled out of Lebanon, and they are brandishing their claws in the Taiwan Strait area again.
    The people of the whole country know, and the people of the whole world know, that it is the United States that has occupied our territory of Taiwan, it is the United States that has prevented the people of Taiwan from returning to the embrace of the motherland, it is the United States that supports the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, attempting to split China, and now it is the United States that is carrying out war threats against our coastal islands of Jinmen and Mazu.
    Our people across the country, with one heart and one mind, resolutely support Premier Zhou's statement and will never allow the barbaric pirate behavior of U.S. imperialism.
    Our people across the country all love peace. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we are going all out, striving for the upper reaches, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, to build our motherland into a beautiful paradise on earth. We absolutely do not need war. But if imperialism wants to launch a war, we are not afraid of war either.
    The imperialists must understand that the 600 million people of China have long stood up, united, and organized. Under the banner of Mao Zedong, we will surely liberate Taiwan, we must defend the territorial sovereignty of the motherland, and we will surely defend peace in the Far East and the world.

　　民盟中央主席沈钧儒说：
    美国强盗若不赶快滚开  一定把它埋葬在台湾海峡同志们！同胞们！
    不久以前，我们在这里开大会抗议帝国主义无理干涉中东，现在美国强盗还没有从黎巴嫩滚出去，又在台湾海峡地区来张牙舞爪了。
    全国人民都知道，全世界人民都知道，是美国侵占了我国领土台湾，是美国阻止了台湾人民回到祖国的怀抱，是美国支持蒋介石卖国集团，企图分裂中国，现在又是美国向我国沿海岛屿金门、马祖进行战争威胁。
    我们全国人民，万众一心，坚决拥护周总理的声明，决不容许美帝国主义野蛮的海盗行为。
    我们全国人民都是热爱和平的。我们在中国共产党、毛主席领导下，正在鼓足干劲、力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，要把我们祖国建造成美好的人间乐园。我们决不需要战争。但是帝国主义要发动战争，我们也决不害怕战争。
    帝国主义者要明白，中国六亿人民早已经站起来了，团结起来、组织起来了，在毛泽东的旗帜下，我们一定能够解放台湾，一定要保卫祖国的领土主权，一定能保卫远东和世界和平。
