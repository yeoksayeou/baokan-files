Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th -- Former US Ambassador to India, Republican Senator Cooper, delivered a radio address on the 9th, saying that he "does not believe that waging a war for Jinmen and Mazu is in (America's) national interest."

He said that Eisenhower’s “virtual guarantee” that the United States would help the Chiang Kai-shek group “defend” Jinmen and Mazu has placed the United States in a “dangerous situation.” He said the United States must "weigh the necessity of preserving these islands against the possibility of fighting China, and possibly Russia."

Cooper advocated that the United States order the Chiang Kai-shek group to withdraw its troops from the coastal islands of mainland China, even if this would damage the prestige of the United States in the Far East.

However, like some other figures in the US ruling group, Cooper also openly advocated that the United States "do everything possible" to seize China's territory of Taiwan, and he also absurdly advocated that this territory of China be handed over to so-called "United Nations trusteeship" in the future.

    美国已陷于危险的境地
    美参议员库柏对政府玩火行为表示不安
    据新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国前驻印度大使、共和党参议员库柏9日发表广播演讲说，他“并不认为（美国）为了金门和马祖而进行一场战争是符合于（美国的）国家利益的”。
    他说，艾森豪威尔“实际上保证”美国帮助蒋介石集团“保卫”金门和马祖一事已经使美国处于“危险的境地”。他说，美国必须“把保守这些岛屿的必要性跟同中国、可能还有俄国作战的可能性两相权衡一下”。
    库柏主张美国命令蒋介石集团撤退中国大陆沿海岛屿上的军队，即使这将损害美国在远东的威信。
    但是，和美国统治集团中其他一些人物一样，库柏也公然主张美国“尽一切力量”来霸占中国的领土台湾，他还荒谬地主张在以后把中国的这块领土交给所谓“联合国托管”。
