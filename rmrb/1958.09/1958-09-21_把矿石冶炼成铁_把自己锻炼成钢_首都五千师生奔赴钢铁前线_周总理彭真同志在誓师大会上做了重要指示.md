Xinhua News Agency, September 20th:
    More than five thousand teachers and students from ten universities and six secondary vocational schools in Beijing Municipality, responding to the call of the Party Central Committee, have rushed to the steel front in sixteen provinces and cities across the country to participate in mining, ore dressing, and chemical analysis work, to temper themselves and transform their thinking. This morning, a mobilization rally was held at Peking University. Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, and Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, made important instructions at the meeting.

    The teachers and students attending the conference stated that they must grow together with the blast furnace, refine molten iron, and also temper themselves into steel, returning to Beijing with a double harvest of ideology and production.

    Premier Zhou first spoke at the meeting, saying: You are responding to the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to go to the steel front, which is a glorious and great task. This year, steel production must double that of last year, and we must produce 10.7 million tons. This is a matter for the people of the whole country, not just the employees of steel enterprises. In accordance with the spirit of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers running enterprises together, you should of course also share a part of the production tasks. In order to complete this year's steel production plan, special efforts are needed in the next four months, requiring the whole people to take action. At present, there is a particular need for some people with knowledge of prospecting, mining, and chemical analysis to participate in this labor. Therefore, the Party has decided to mobilize 10,000 teachers and students in chemical engineering and 10,000 teachers and students in geological exploration from provinces and cities across the country to work on the steel front. We originally hoped that students in Beijing would take the lead in signing up for this work, and now you have responded to the Party's call with 5,000 people. The glorious red flag is planted in Beijing, in various universities and secondary vocational schools in Beijing. I am here to congratulate you and feel happy and proud for you.

    This glorious task is also the best opportunity for you to temper yourselves. Our education policy is to combine education with productive labor, combine mental labor with physical labor, and combine work, study, and labor. This is a policy that must be implemented to the end, it is a communist style, and it is a necessary condition for realizing communism. I hope you will work hard, study hard, and labor hard. I believe that going to factories and mines to study, temper yourselves, and practice will be of greater help to you.

    You are fortunate to live in the great Mao Zedong era. We are very envious of you. We were born three or four decades earlier than you and were influenced by a lot of bourgeois education in the past. Therefore, we older generation of Communists must also constantly transform our thinking. Now, although you are very happy to receive socialist education from a young age, bourgeois ideology also has an impact on you. Therefore, I hope that you will also pay attention to ideological transformation in this labor tempering. I wish you victory.

    Then Comrade Peng Zhen spoke, saying: It is a great happy event that comrades are setting off to the steel production front today. We are here to send you off to join the army to go to the front line. Saying "joining the army" means joining the ranks of the working class, and "going to the front line" means going to the steel production front line, that is, truly participating in the labor army to actually participate in production. He said, how can a young student who does not labor together with the working people, does not participate in the struggle on the production front, and does not develop labor habits and a love for labor truly become an intellectual of the working class? You have two tasks in going to the steel production front this time: one is to participate in the steel army and help solve specific problems in prospecting, mining, ore dressing, and chemical analysis; the other is to combine theory with practice, learn production skills, and temper your working-class consciousness. Then he said that he heard that many students were very enthusiastic about going to the front line this time, so excited that they couldn't sleep, waiting to set off with gongs and drums and jubilation. At the same time, there may be a very small number of people who have concerns about affecting their studies, being unable to do it, or even being afraid of hardship. He said that for us, the best and greatest learning is on the production front and the political front, and in tempering in actual struggle. Book knowledge is an important weapon for us, but we must not exaggerate or be superstitious about its role. We must know that generally speaking, it is often behind the actual situation. Everyone knows that on the agricultural front, we have already launched many high-yield "satellites" one after another, breaking world high-yield records, breaking through various outdated frameworks of agricultural science, and making many book knowledge pale in comparison and feel ashamed of being backward. We are also beginning to launch "satellites" one by one on the industrial and other fronts, making those who cling to book knowledge unable to catch up. Aren't these all clear proofs? Of course, this is not to say that book knowledge is useless, but that it must be combined with practice and must be constantly tested and enriched and developed with practical experience. This time you are going to the steel front, you can bring theoretical knowledge to the actual situation to use it well, check which book knowledge is right and which is wrong, and which needs to be revised, supplemented, and developed. In practice, the rich experience created by the masses is summarized and systematized to enrich theoretical knowledge. How will this delay learning? He said that some people are "afraid of not being able to do it," admit that they can't do it, and are afraid of things when they happen. It is good to learn humbly, but there is no need to be afraid. We must be determined to learn from workers, peasants, and cadres, and discuss things with cadres and the masses. They have a lot of practical experience, and as long as you combine with them and be their elementary school students, everything will be easier to handle. Then he pointed out that fear of hardship is the bourgeoisie's ideology at work. He said, as a youth of the Mao Zedong era and an intellectual of the working class, how can you still be afraid of hardship? He said that looking at everyone's spirit today, they are not afraid of hardship. We must find hardships and find problems to solve and overcome. Wherever there are difficulties and problems, we will go there. This is our glorious task. Finally, he wished everyone a great harvest and return. He wished everyone a rich harvest in the material production of steel, a rich harvest in tempering labor concepts and labor habits, and a rich harvest in smashing and eliminating bourgeois ideology and tempering working-class consciousness and cultivating communist spirit.

    Liu Aifeng, Vice Minister of Education, also spoke at the meeting.

    Wang Zhaoji, a student from the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, and Wang Yuxiao, a student from Peking University, expressed their determination to the conference on behalf of the students of their respective schools. In his speech, Wang Zhaoji first reported good news to the Party, Premier Zhou, and Comrade Peng Zhen. In July and August, more than 4,000 teachers and students from the Institute of Geological Exploration found 15.5 billion tons of iron ore reserves for the motherland, equivalent to seven times the iron ore reserves of Britain. They also found 4.1 billion tons of coal reserves and trained 40,000 geological cadres and 170,000 ore reporters for various places. Wang Zhaoji said: This time we go out, we must turn the high mountains upside down, ask the mountain gods to offer treasures, and uncover the secrets of the deep mountains of Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu, Henan, and Guangdong. We will never come down the mountain if we do not overfulfill the task. Wang Yuxiao said: We must put politics in command, humbly learn from workers and peasants, learn their excellent qualities, learn their practical knowledge, not be afraid of hardship, not be afraid of difficulties, work hard and in a big way, fight for steel, build the motherland, and liberate Taiwan.

    把矿石冶炼成铁　把自己锻炼成钢
    首都五千师生奔赴钢铁前线
    周总理彭真同志在誓师大会上做了重要指示
    新华社20日讯　北京市十个高等学校六个中等专业学校五千多师生，响应党中央的号召，奔赴全国十六个省、市钢铁战线参加采矿、选矿及化验分析工作，锻炼自己，改造思想。今天上午在北京大学举行了誓师大会，中共中央副主席、国务院总理周恩来，中共中央书记处书记、中共北京市委第一书记彭真在会上作了重要指示。
    参加大会的教师和学生表示一定要和高炉一起成长，炼出铁水，也把自己冶炼成钢，带着思想和生产的双丰收返回北京。
    周总理首先在会上讲话，他说：你们响应党中央和国务院的号召到钢铁战线上去，这是一个光荣伟大的任务。今年钢的生产要比去年翻一番，一定要生产一千零七十万吨。这是全国人民的事，决不只是钢铁企业中职工的事。按照工农商学兵全民一起办企业的精神，你们当然也应该分担一部分生产任务。为了完成今年钢铁生产计划，在今后四个月中还须要特别努力，需要全民动手，目前特别需要一部分有探矿、采矿、化验知识的人来参加这项劳动，因此党决定在全国各省市动员一万化工方面的教师和学生，一万地质勘探方面的教师和学生到钢铁战线上去工作。我们本来就希望北京市的学生在报名参加这项工作中领先，果然现在你们响应党的号召出了五千人，光荣的红旗插在北京市了，插在北京市的各个高等学校和中等专业学校里了。我特来向你们祝贺，为你们感到高兴和自豪。
    这个光荣的任务对你们来说同时也是一个最好的锻炼机会，我们的教育方针是把教育和生产劳动结合起来，把脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来，把工作、学习、劳动三方面结合起来。这是要贯彻到底的方针，是共产主义的风格，是实现共产主义的必须条件。希望你们努力工作，努力学习，努力劳动。我相信你们到工厂、矿山去学习、锻炼、实践，将会对你们有更大的帮助。
    你们幸运地生活在伟大的毛泽东时代，我们非常羡慕你们，我们比你们早生了三四十年，过去曾经受了不少资产阶级教育的影响。因此我们老一辈的共产党人也还要经常改造自己的思想，现在你们虽然很幸福地从青年时代起就受的是社会主义的教育，但是资产阶级的思想对你们也是有影响的，所以，希望你们在这次劳动锻炼中也要重视思想改造。祝你们胜利。
    接着彭真同志讲话，他说：今天同志们出发到钢铁生产前线去是一件大喜事。我们是来欢送同志们入伍上前线的，说入伍，是工人阶级的伍，上前线，是上钢铁生产的前线，即真正地参加劳动大军去实际参加生产。他说，一个青年学生不跟劳动人民一起劳动，不参加生产前线的斗争，不养成劳动习惯和爱好劳动的观念，怎样能使自己真正成为工人阶级的知识分子呢？你们这次上钢铁生产前线去的任务，有两个，一个是参加钢铁大军，帮助解决找矿、开矿、选矿石和化验分析等工作中的具体问题；一个是把理论和实践结合起来，学习生产本领，锻炼自己的工人阶级意识。接着他说，对这次上前线，我听说许多同学热情很高，兴奋得睡不着觉，锣鼓喧天、欢欣鼓舞地等着出发。同时也可能有极少数人有怕影响学习、怕不行甚至怕吃苦等顾虑。他说，对于我们来说，最好最大的学习，是在生产战线和政治战线上，在实际斗争中的锻炼。书本知识是我们的一种重要武器，但是我们不可夸大或者迷信它的作用，要知一般说它往往是落后于实际的。大家都知道，我们在农业战线上，已经一颗接一颗的放了很多的高产“卫星”，打破了世界高产纪录，冲破了各种陈旧的农业科学的框子，使很多书本知识相形见拙，自惭落伍。我们在工业等战线上，也开始在放出一个个的“卫星”，使死抱书本知识的人，望尘莫及，这不都是明证么？当然，这不是说书本知识无用，而是说它必须和实践相结合，必须不断地用实践经验来检验它和丰富发展它。你们这次上钢铁前线去，正可以把理论知识带到实际中去好好运用，检查书本知识哪些对哪些不对，哪些需要修正、补充、发展。在实践中把群众创造的丰富的经验加以总结、条理化，来丰富理论知识。这怎样会耽误学习呢。他说，有人“怕不行”，承认不行，临事而惧，虚心学习是好的，但是，用不着怕。要下决心向工人、农民群众和干部学习，有事和干部、群众商量。他们有很多实际经验，你们只要和他们结合起来，给他们当小学生，什么事都会比较好办。接着他指出怕吃苦是资产阶级思想在作怪。他说作为毛泽东时代的青年，工人阶级的知识分子，怎么还会怕吃苦呢？他说，看大家今天的气概，是不怕吃苦的。我们要找困苦、找问题来解决、克服，哪里有困难、有问题，就到哪里去，这就是我们的光荣任务。最后，他预祝大家大丰收而归。预祝大家在钢铁的物质生产上获得丰收，在锻炼劳动观念、劳动习惯上获得丰收，在粉碎和肃清资产阶级思想，和锻炼工人阶级意识，锻炼共产主义精神方面获得丰收。
    教育部副部长刘皑风也在会上讲了话。
    北京地质勘探学院学生王兆姬、北京大学学生王玉萧代表自己学校的学生向大会表示决心。王兆姬在发言中首先向党、向周总理、彭真同志报喜，地质勘探学院有四千多师生在7、8两个月中为祖国找到了一百五十五亿吨储量的铁矿，相当于英国铁矿储量的七倍。还找到了四十一亿吨储量的煤矿，为各地培养了四万地质干部，十七万报矿员。王兆姬说：我们这次出去一定要把高山闹翻，叫山神献宝，揭开青海、宁夏、甘肃、河南、广东深山的秘密，不超额完成任务决不下山。王玉萧说：我们一定要政治挂帅，虚心向工农学习，学习他们优秀的品质，学习他们的实际知识，不怕苦，不怕难，大干特干，为钢铁而战，建设祖国，解放台湾。
