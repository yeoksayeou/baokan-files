Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 24th: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today supporting the statement made by Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi on the 20th.

The commentary stated that Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the coastal islands of China have been Chinese territory since ancient times. The Chinese people's liberation of these islands is the sacred and inviolable right of the Chinese people and is an internal affair that does not allow any interference.

The commentary pointed out that the dispute between China and the United States is due to the United States sending armed forces to occupy Taiwan and interfering in China's internal affairs.

The commentary refuted the recent upside-down claims by Eisenhower and Dulles that the Chinese people's liberation of its inseparable territory is "aggression" and that the United States is engaged in "defense." The commentary said that this thief-crying-stop-thief logic of the aggressors is not worth refuting. If a country were to send its naval and air forces to conduct military demonstrations in the sea near New York, would the American aggressors consider this a reasonable act of "defense"?

The commentary emphasized that the United States must immediately stop interfering in China's internal affairs and withdraw its aggressive troops from the Taiwan Strait area; in this way, the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait area can be eliminated.

The commentary condemned the United States' attempt to use the Sino-US talks being held in Warsaw to cover up its aggressive behavior. The commentary said that peace-loving people will never allow the United States' conspiracy to succeed.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”指出
    侵略者的逻辑不值一驳
    新华社平壤24日电  朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论，支持中国外交部长陈毅在20日发表的声明。
    评论说，台湾、澎湖列岛和中国沿海岛屿自古以来就是中国的领土；中国人民解放这些岛屿是中国人民的神圣不可侵犯的权利，是不容许任何人干涉的内政问题。
    评论指出，中美两国间的纠纷是由于美国派遣武装部队侵占台湾，并且对中国的内部事务进行干涉而引起的。
    评论驳斥了艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯最近发表的反诬中国人民解放它的不可分割的领土是“侵略”、而美国是在“防御”的颠倒黑白的说法。评论说，这种贼喊捉贼式的侵略者的逻辑是不值一驳的。如果把某一个国家派遣海、空军到美国纽约附近的海面进行军事示威说是进行“防御”，美国侵略者认为这是合理的吗？
    评论强调说，美国必须立即停止对中国内政的干涉，并且把它的侵略军队撤出台湾海峡地区；这样，台湾海峡地区的紧张局势就可以消除。
    评论谴责美国企图利用正在华沙举行的中美会谈来掩盖它的侵略行为。评论说，爱好和平的人民决不容许美国的阴谋得逞。
