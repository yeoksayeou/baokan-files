Good News for Patients with Esophageal Stricture

Three-year-old girl Li Juan accidentally swallowed lye, which burned her esophagus. After contracting "esophageal stricture," she couldn't swallow anything when she tried to eat. Her mother rushed her to the First Affiliated Hospital of Shenyang Medical College. Surgeons used a creative new method to operate on little Li Juan. A month later, she returned home and happily ate all kinds of food as usual.

Surgeons at the First Affiliated Hospital of Shenyang Medical College, in collaboration with Soviet experts, adopted a method of cutting the greater curvature of the stomach from the fundus of the stomach, connecting it to the pylorus, and reconstructing a new esophagus. This allows patients to eat, with food passing from the mouth through the esophagus into the stomach. This new surgery overcomes the shortcomings of commonly used past surgeries and is more advanced than methods currently used in other countries. This method has already cured seven patients, including little Li Juan.

    食管狭窄患者的福音
    三岁小女孩李娟，一天误吃了面碱，把食管烧坏了，得了“食管狭窄”病以后，再吃东西，一点也咽不下去。妈妈急忙把她送进沈阳医学院第一附属医院。外科医生采用了一种创造性的新方法，给小李娟动了手术。一个月以后，她回到家里，和往常一样，愉快地吃着各种食物。
    沈阳医学院第一附属医院的外科医生与苏联专家共同研究，采用了胃大弯从胃底切离，与幽门相通，再造一根新食管的方法，病人吃东西，便能由嘴经食管进入胃内。这种新的手术，弥补了过去常用手术的缺点，比各国目前采用的方法都要完善。用这种方法已经治愈了七个病人，小李娟就是其中之一。
