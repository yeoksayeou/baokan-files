According to a Vietnam News Agency report: On the eve of Vietnam's National Day, Tran Dai Nghia, Deputy Minister of Industry of Vietnam, spoke to a Vietnam News Agency reporter about the achievements of the three-year restoration and construction of state-owned industry, saying that in just over three years, the Vietnamese working class has achieved tremendous achievements, which the imperialist rulers could not achieve in the past nearly a hundred years.

He went on to say that this year, the Vietnamese working class is celebrating National Day with joy and pride in the tremendous achievements of the past three years.

He said that by the end of 1957, a total of 107 state-owned enterprises had been put into production or were being restored and constructed, greatly exceeding the number of enterprise units during the French colonial rule. If the total output value of state-owned enterprises in 1955 is taken as 100, then it was 563 in 1956 and 822 in 1957. Compared with 1939, the most prosperous year for industry during the French colonial rule, the total industrial output value has reached almost the same level, and the current production potential is even greater than in the past.

He said that now, in addition to restoring and expanding the original enterprises, many new enterprises have been built and are being built. While focusing on developing light industries that produce daily consumer goods, such as tea, matches, cigarettes, wool yarn, and soap factories, the Party and the government also plan to appropriately develop enterprises that produce means of production and export commodities, such as phosphate fertilizer, apatite, tin, ferrochrome, timber, and canned fish and tea processing plants, especially the modern Hanoi Machine Tool Factory.

He said that in the process of socialist industrialization in the North, great importance has been attached to the development of the power industry. Of the seven newly built power plants, five have been completed, two of which are hydroelectric power stations. The power generation capacity in the North today is much higher than during the French colonial rule, and will far exceed it in the next few years.

He concluded by saying that after three years of struggle, Vietnam's state-owned industry has made great progress, improved the past dependent and backward economic landscape, satisfied the needs of the people to a certain extent, helped improve people's lives, and consolidated the strong North, which is the foundation for a unified motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, Tran Huu Duc, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, said in an interview with a Vietnam News Agency reporter that the rural areas of North Vietnam have undergone tremendous changes since the August Revolution of 1945.

He said that in these thirteen years, the feudal countryside has given way to a democratic countryside marching towards socialism. He said that this is a great revolutionary achievement, which paves the way for even greater achievements.

Land reform enabled the working peasants of North Vietnam to obtain 810,000 hectares of land, as well as a large number of livestock and farm implements. The feudal land ownership system has been completely eliminated.

Each poor peasant now has about 1,400 square meters (approximately more than two mu) of cultivated land, while before they only had 190 to 428 square meters of cultivated land. While carrying out land reform, the agricultural cooperativization movement was initially developed. The ancient individual labor in the countryside for centuries has begun to turn to collective labor.

Illiteracy—a relic of the feudal and colonial systems—will soon be eliminated. Hygiene and medical work are being vigorously carried out in the rural areas of Vietnam, as is the struggle against bad habits and superstitions, as well as literary, artistic, and sports activities.

After the restoration of peace, despite the many enormous difficulties caused by the war and continuous droughts, and the fact that cultivation techniques are still very backward, the average yield of rice per hectare in North Vietnam has increased from 1.3 tons in 1939 to nearly 1.8 tons now (equivalent to 240 jin per mu), and the total output has increased from 2.4 million tons to 4 million tons.

Tran Huu Duc emphasized that after intensifying the cooperativization movement, improving technology, and fighting against natural disasters, the output will be even higher. At present, the cooperativization movement is still at a very low level, but it already has a solid foundation, on which the rural areas of North Vietnam can move towards socialism.

Tran Huu Duc also said that many farmers in North Vietnam not only have enough food and clothing and have improved their spiritual lives, but also are able to build new houses themselves. In most rural areas, farmers are able to send their children to primary and secondary schools.

    越南三年赛过以往一百年
    大力发展国营工业改善了落后的经济面貌
    农村起了巨大变化生产提高农民生活日好
    本报讯　据越南通讯社消息：越南工业部副部长陈大义在越南国庆前夕同越南通讯社记者谈三年恢复和建设国营工业成就时说，仅三年多一些的时间内，越南工人阶级已经取得巨大的成就，而帝国主义统治者在过去近一百年都做不到的。
    他接着说，今年，越南工人阶级是以对三年来巨大成就的欢欣振奋和自豪来庆祝国庆节的。
    他说，截至1957年底为止，已经投入生产和正在恢复、建设中的国营企业共有一百零七个，在企业单位数量上大大超过了法国殖民统治时期。如果以1955年国营企业总产值为100，那么1956年为563，1957年为822。同法国殖民统治时期工业最繁荣的1939年比较，工业总产值已经达到差不多一样了，而现在的生产潜力又比过去大。
    他说，现在，除了恢复和扩大原有企业外，许多新企业已经兴建起来和正在兴建中。在着重发展生产日用消费品的轻工业，如茶叶、火柴、纸烟、绒线、肥皂等工厂的同时，党和政府还有计划适当地发展生产生产资料和出口商品的企业，如磷肥、磷灰石、锡、铬铁、木材和罐头鱼、茶叶加工厂等厂矿，特别是现代化的河内机器厂。
    他说，在进行北方社会主义工业化过程中，电力工业的发展获得很大的重视。新建的七个发电厂中，已经竣工的有五个，其中有两个是水力发电站。北方今天的发电能力已经大大超过法国殖民统治时期，今后几年还将远远地超过。
    他最后说，经过三年的奋斗，越南国营工业获得了很大的进步，改善了过去的附属的、落后的经济面貌，在一定程度上满足了人民的需要，有助于改善人民生活，巩固了作为统一祖国基础的强固的北方。
    据新华社河内电　据越南通讯社报道，越南劳动党中央委员会农村工作部部长陈友翼在接见越南通讯社记者时说，自从1945年八月革命以来，越南北方的农村有了巨大的变化。
    他说，在这十三年里，封建农村让位给向社会主义迈进的民主农村。他说，这是伟大的革命成就，它为更大的成就铺平道路。
    土地改革使越南北方的劳动农民获得了八十一万公顷的土地以及大批耕畜和农具。封建土地所有制被彻底消灭了。
    每个贫农现在有大约一千四百平方公尺（按约合两市亩多）的耕地，而以前只有一百九十到四百二十八平方公尺的耕地。在进行土地改革的同时，初步发展农业合作化运动。几世纪以来农村中的古老的个体劳动已经开始转向集体劳动。
    文盲——封建和殖民制度的遗物——不久将要消灭。在越南农村中正在大力开展卫生医疗工作，反对不良习俗和迷信的斗争，文学、艺术和体育活动。
    在和平恢复以后，虽然有着战争遗留下的和连续的旱灾所造成的许多巨大的困难，并且耕种技术仍然非常落后，但是越南北方每公顷水稻平均产量从1939年的一点三吨提高到现在的将近一点八吨（按合每市亩二百四十市斤），总产量从二百四十万吨提高到四百万吨。
    陈友翼强调说，在加紧开展合作化运动、改良技术和同自然灾害作斗争以后，产量将会更高。目前，合作化运动仍然在很低的水平上，但是它已经有了巩固的基础，在这个基础上可以使越南北方农村走向社会主义。
    陈友翼还说，越南北方许多农民不仅有足够的衣食，提高了精神生活水平，而且能够自己建新房。在大部分农村中，农民能够送子弟进小学和中学。
