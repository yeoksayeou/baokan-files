Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st. The victory of rescuing Qiu Cai Kang, a worker burned at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, is a great victory for the Party's leadership in scientific and health undertakings. The Shanghai Second Medical College Party Committee published a summary of the rescue work in the Liberation Daily on August 30, explaining that the entire medical process was a fierce struggle between the proletarian medical viewpoint and treatment methods and the bourgeois medical viewpoint and treatment methods.

The summary analyzes in detail how this fierce struggle unfolded along the following lines. When doctors saw that Qiu Cai Kang's burn area reached 89.3%, they thought of the materials of the world's trauma authority, American Evans, and felt that it was impossible to save him. After the consultation, all surgeons in and out of the hospital signed "poor prognosis." Just when they were at a loss and dared not hope for anything, the Party Committee of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 sent a letter requesting the doctors to cure the patient for the sake of steel production. The Second Medical College Party Committee made an appropriate analysis of the doctors' ideological situation at that time, and correctly pointed out that we should write down what is not recorded in the literature of capitalist countries; capitalists only think of profits and are unwilling to spend effort and money to rescue workers. We are a country where the working class is the master, and our hospital serves the working people wholeheartedly. We must do everything possible to rescue the steel warrior. This letter and these words swept away the doctors' despair, pointed out their medical direction, and stimulated their sense of responsibility for rescuing the patient. At the same time, more than 40 doctors were mobilized to read all the burn literature of the past few decades in one morning and discussed and decided on 15 treatment methods. The doctors quickly liberated themselves from the negative mood of "doing their best" and stepped onto the road of trying every means to rescue the patient.

The Party Calls on the Masses to Find Solutions in Serious Times

However, after the shock period when burn patients are most likely to die, doctors found Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Qiu Cai Kang's blood. If it is not controlled in time, it will cause systemic sepsis and cause the patient to die quickly. The only drug to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa at present is polymyxin. According to the literature in capitalist countries, based on animal experiments, polymyxin can generally only be used continuously in small amounts for seven days. Exceeding this dose may damage the kidneys. At this time, the Party organization immediately grasped this key issue and guided the doctors to study what is the main contradiction at present and how to solve it? The result of the discussion was: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main contradiction that endangers life and must be subdued first. As for the kidneys, they must be protected with drugs. The application results proved that although the dose and number of days were exceeded, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was finally controlled without damaging the kidneys.

After the sepsis was controlled, a large number of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were found in the wound on the left leg. According to the opinions of most doctors, the leg must be amputated, and there is no guarantee of preserving Qiu Cai Kang's life. At this critical moment, the Party called on the broad masses to find solutions. The Microbiology Teaching and Research Group of Shanghai Second Medical College proposed bacteriophage therapy, which had been recorded in international literature but had not been used clinically. In order to find this bacterium that devours Pseudomonas aeruginosa, more than 60 students from the Second Medical College went to the suburbs for several days to dig cesspools and find sewage. They brought these fecal water and sewage back, and after separation and cultivation, they finally obtained enough necessary bacteriophages, eliminated the Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the wound, and made the patient safely pass through the dangerous situation again. This clinical application of bacteriophage is another innovation in medical science.

Analyze the Condition with Marxist-Leninist Viewpoints and Methods

Through these concrete facts, the summary proves that no matter what work is carried out, including treating illnesses, it is necessary to constantly analyze and study, arrange various primary and secondary contradictions, grasp the main contradictions, and go all out. However, in the past, medical personnel only saw the part and not the whole, only saw the condition and not the patient, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, and often failing because they attended to one thing and lost sight of another.

Talking about the Party's leadership, the summary pointed out that the Party's leadership is not purely technical, but politically leads technology; it is not partial, but takes care of the part while paying attention to the whole. The Party's leadership is not only ideological and political, but also methodological. The so-called method is to lead the masses to observe the condition with Marxist-Leninist viewpoints and methods, specifically analyze the changes, and promptly point out the methods, so as not to panic when the condition turns worse, and not to be proud and paralyzed when the condition is stable. It is not about pretending to understand technical details, but about making decisive decisions on major key issues. For example, when medical personnel are superstitious about the literature and authorities of capitalist countries and dare not imagine and create, the Party instructs them to dare to speak and dare to think, stimulates their self-esteem, and encourages their achievements bit by bit. For example, when medical personnel are confined to one point and cannot extricate themselves, the Party instructs them not to only see one finger and not the whole hand.

The summary said that the Party's leadership is the combination of leadership and the masses, the combination of politics and business, and the combination of redness and expertise.

The Party Can Lead All Scientific Departments

The summary concluded: In the process of rescuing Qiu Cai Kang for more than two months, the leadership of the Party convinced many senior doctors. They admitted: "Marxism-Leninism can really cure diseases." One professor said: "People call me a surgical expert, but I only specialize in my corner of surgery, and I don't specialize in other corners of surgery. Only the Party can comprehensively analyze and comprehensively lead." Someone else said: "At the beginning, the Party asked us to do our best to rescue and complete the task successfully. I thought this was someone who didn't understand science forcing others to do something difficult. As the days passed, I saw how the Party solved problems at critical moments, how the broad masses of people enthusiastically helped each other, and how Qiu Cai Kang himself still kept steel production in mind when his life was in danger. These all moved me. I admit that only by relying on the Party and relying on the people can we intellectuals turn knowledge into useful power and quickly become useful people."

The Party led them forward step by step, which was a process of repeated destruction and establishment, and continuous improvement. It was also a concrete implementation of the Party's policy on intellectuals. Someone said: This rescue of Qiu Cai Kang is, on the one hand, doctors treating Qiu Cai Kang, and on the other hand, Qiu Cai Kang treating everyone, treating the disease of being superstitious about foreign authorities, superstitious about books, not believing in the Party, not believing in the masses, and not proceeding from reality.

The summary pointed out that the rescue of Qiu Cai Kang and the subsequent admission of more than a dozen severe burn cases fully demonstrate that only the proletarian party can lead all walks of life, including the meticulous and highly precise medical science.

　　一篇生动的政治报告
　　上海第二医学院党委发表抢救丘财康的总结
    据新华社上海1日电　抢救上钢三厂烧伤工人丘财康的胜利，是党领导科学卫生事业的巨大胜利。中共上海第二医学院委员会8月30日在解放日报发表了抢救工作的总结，说明全部医疗过程是一场无产阶级医学观点、治疗方法与资产阶级医学观点、治疗方法的激烈的斗争过程。
    总结详细分析了这场激烈斗争是沿着这样的路线展开的。当医生们一看到丘财康的烧伤面积达89.3％，他们就想到世界外伤权威美国伊文思的材料，觉得这是无法挽救的，会诊后，全院和院外的外科医生都签上“预后将不良”。正在这个束手无策，不敢有所希望的时候，上钢三厂党委送来了一封信，请求医生为了钢铁生产，非要把病人治好不可。二医党委针对当时医生们的思想情况，作了恰当的分析，正确地指出：资本主义国家文献所没有记载的，我们就来把它写上；资本家想到的只是利润，决不愿费力花钱去抢救工人。我们是工人阶级当家作主的国家，我们的医院是全心全意为劳动人民服务的，我们一定要千方百计地抢救钢铁战士。这封信和这席话，扫除了医生们的绝望情绪，指出了他们的医疗方向，激发了他们抢救病人的责任感。同时动员了四十多位医生，用一个上午时间，把几十年来的灼伤文献全部看完，讨论决定了十五条治疗方法。医生们迅速的从“聊尽人事”的消极情绪下解放出来，向千方百计抢救病人的道路上跨进。
    在严重的关头党号召群众想办法
    但是经过烫伤病人极易死亡的休克期后，医生们在丘财康的血液里发现有绿脓杆菌，若不及时控制，将引起全身败血症，促使病人迅速死亡。医治绿脓杆菌现时的唯一药物，就是多粘菌素。在资本主义国家文献上说，根据动物实验，多粘菌素，一般只能小量地连续用七天，超过这个剂量可能就要损坏肾脏。这时，党组织立即抓住这一关键问题，引导医生们研究什么是现时的主要矛盾，怎样加以解决？商讨结果是：绿脓杆菌是危及生命的现实主要矛盾，必须先要制服它，至于肾脏，要用药剂保护。应用结果证明，虽然超过剂量，超过天数，但终于控制了绿脓杆菌感染，也没有损害肾脏。
    控制了败血症后，左腿部伤口又发现大量绿脓杆菌的感染，按照大部分医生的意见，必须截肢，而且还没有把握保全丘财康的生命。在这种严重关头，党号召广大群众想办法，上海第二医学院微生物教研组提出国际文献上曾有记载但未经临床运用过的噬菌体治疗。为了寻找这种吞噬绿脓杆菌的菌体，第二医学院六十多位学生接连几天到市郊去掏粪坑，找污水，把这些粪水和污水带回来，经过分离、培养、终于得出足够的必要的噬菌体，消灭了伤口上的绿脓杆菌，使病人又一次安全地度过了险境。这种噬菌体的临床应用，是医学科学上又一创举。
　　用马克思列宁主义观点方法分析病情
    总结通过这些具体事实，证明了无论进行任何工作，治病也不例外，必须经常分析研究，排列各种主次矛盾，抓住主要矛盾，全力以赴。但过去医务人员中，只见局部，不见整体，只见病情，不见病人，头痛医头，脚痛医脚，顾此失彼因而遭致失败的治疗方法，是经常可以看到的。
    谈到党的领导时，总结指出党的领导不是纯技术的，而是政治带领技术；不是局部的，而是在注意全面的情况下照顾局部。党的领导，不仅是政治思想上的，而且也是方法上的。所谓方法，就是带领群众一起用马列主义的观点方法来观察病情，具体分析变化，及时指出做法，既不在病情转向恶化时惊慌失措，又不在病情稳定时骄傲麻痹。不是在技术细节问题上的不懂装懂，而是在重大关键问题上的当机立断。例如，当着医务人员迷信资本主义国家文献和权威而不敢设想和创造的时候，党就指点他们要敢说、敢想，激发他们的自尊心，鼓励他们一点一滴的成就。又如，当医务人员囿于一点不能自拔的时候，党就指点他们不要只见一指，不见全手。
    总结说，党的领导，就是领导与群众相结合，政治与业务相结合，红与专相结合。
    党能领导一切科学部门
    总结最后说：在两个多月抢救丘财康的工作过程中，党的领导作用使许多高级医生都心服口服了。他们承认：“马列主义真能治病”。有一位教授说：“人称我外科专家，其实我只专我那一角外科，别角外科我就不专。只有党，才能全面分析，全面领导。”又有人说：“开始党要我们尽力抢救，务必胜利完成任务，我觉得这是不懂科学的人强人所难。一天天过去，我见到党如何在紧要关头解决问题，广大人民群众如何热情相助，丘财康本人在生命岌岌可危时刻仍念念不忘钢铁生产，这些都感动了我。我承认，只有依靠党，依靠人民，我们知识分子才能把知识变成有用的力量，才能很快成为有用的人。”
    党带领他们步步前进，是一个反复破立，节节提高的过程，也是党的知识分子政策具体贯彻的过程。有人说：这次抢救丘财康，一方面是医生在给丘财康治病，另一方面是通过丘财康给大家治病，医治那种迷信洋权威，迷信书本，不相信党，不相信群众，不从实际出发的病。
    总结指出，抢救丘财康和后来陆续入院的十多个重烫伤病例都充分说明，只有无产阶级的政党才能领导各行各业，包括细密的、高度精确的医学科学事业。
