Thousands of Sails Racing, Ten Thousand Trees Competing for Glory
Xinhua News Agency reporters Yuan Mu and Lu Yin

Autumn is the season of harvest. Amidst the joyful reports of a bumper agricultural harvest, the industrial front is also a scene of waving red flags and frequent victories. The 50,000 exhibits sent by workers from all over the country for the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition are like countless shining pearls, vying for brilliance and beauty in the majestic Beijing Exhibition Center and the Architectural Exhibition Hall, displaying a moving scene of a great industrial harvest.

This is the largest exhibition in China's history, with fifteen industrial departments setting up fifteen pavilions, covering a total area of approximately 40,000 square meters. The grand Beijing Exhibition Center is completely filled, and still cannot accommodate all the exhibits, so four pavilions are located in the Architectural Exhibition Hall southwest of the Beijing Exhibition Center. Following the designated route, visiting from the first pavilion to the last covers dozens of miles within the exhibition grounds. If you walk through each exhibit in order, only listening to the brief explanations of the guides, without asking questions or lingering, it would take a full five days.

Among all the exhibits, the vast majority are products of the great leap forward in industry this year. They constitute a picture of "thousands of sails racing, ten thousand trees competing for glory" at the exhibition. People can see from the exhibition that, in order to establish China's independent, strong, and complete socialist industrial system, all sectors of industry are "racing" and "competing for glory", ensuring, cooperating, and promoting each other. It is under this comprehensive surge of communist spirit that we can see from the exhibition that, after the Chinese people wrote the epic of "five years surpassing a hundred years" in the first five-year plan with industrialization speeds exceeding all capitalist countries, this year the steel production jumped from 5.35 million tons last year to 10.7 million tons, machine tools surged from 37,000 units to 80,000 units, coal increased from 130 million tons to 210 million tons, cotton cloth increased from 5 billion meters to 6.3 billion meters... The growth rate of these figures is no longer a dozen, twenty, or so percent, but thirty, forty, fifty, or even multiple times. The astonishing speed shown by the Chinese people in the peaceful competition with capitalist countries has already left them far behind.

Steel and machinery are the two marshals in this competition.

Walking into the vermilion and gold-inlaid gate of the Beijing Exhibition Center, turning to the left, is the "barracks" of the steel marshal – the Metallurgical Industry Exhibition Hall. Here, a huge 43-ton steel ingot stands upright in the center of the hall. It is 3.9 meters high, with a circumference thick enough for three people to embrace. People who stand in front of it and look up cannot help but admire the steelworkers who cast such a huge ingot. With such an ingot, it is possible to provide the necessary forgings for the manufacture of all kinds of huge heavy machinery. Just like the marshal ascending the platform, surrounding the giant-like ingot are hundreds of different types of steel with different compositions and shapes. Charts hanging on the walls tell people that China has added 128 new types of steel this year. Many of the most difficult to smelt and highest quality steel types in the world, the Chinese steelworkers in the great leap forward have already mastered their smelting methods. In terms of quantity, quality, and variety, the day when the Chinese people can completely rely on their own steel to arm themselves is just around the corner!

Turning from the metallurgical pavilion into the central hall and east and west squares of the exhibition hall, a powerful lineup of various new heavy machines and precision machine tools constituting a powerful machine industry immediately comes into our view. Here, we saw the 700 mm primary rolling mill, which can roll a two-ton steel ingot into a billet. Next to it stands a model of a rolling mill that is almost twice as large, which will also be successfully manufactured soon. The 2,500-ton hydraulic press can process huge steel ingots weighing more than 40 tons. During the preparation for the exhibition, this equipment was still being rushed to produce, but now it has been successfully manufactured in Shenyang four months ahead of schedule. China's first 230-ton high-pressure boiler, which was just manufactured by the Harbin Boiler Factory two months ago, can supply all the power for a 50,000 kilowatt power station. The model of this boiler exhibited here is reduced to one-tenth of its original size, but it is still more than ten feet high, while the boiler itself is like a ten-story building, and no exhibition hall can accommodate it. Here, we also saw the complete set of oil drilling equipment that can drill 1,200 meters, the giants on the basic construction sites and mines - the tall electric shovel that can dig three cubic meters of soil at a time, as well as the most precise electrical meters and instruments used in industry, transportation, and telecommunications.

Four years ago, the Beijing Exhibition Center was completed, and the Soviet Economic and Cultural Exhibition was first exhibited here. The powerful Soviet industry attracted millions of visitors. At that time, China did not have an independent aircraft or automobile manufacturing industry, and could not produce heavy machinery and precision machine tools. However, in just four short years, thanks to the help of the Soviet Union and the efforts of the people of the whole country, a miracle finally appeared. Today, people can already see aircraft made in China, dozens of types of trucks and cars, and all kinds of tractors that can run on dry land, paddy fields, and even mountains.

"Use coal to make steel, extract oil, and generate electricity, demand food, use, and clothing from coal," "The motherland's mountains and rivers are magnificent, and the fragrance of oil is everywhere," "Water energy can be transformed into electrical energy, and electrical energy can be transformed into omnipotence." In the three exhibition halls of coal, electricity, and petroleum, these moving and loud slogans express the ambition of coal miners, electrical workers, and petroleum workers across the country. In order to ensure the rapid promotion of the two marshals of steel and machinery, and to meet the needs of all departments of the national economy, they are accelerating the pace of the great leap forward by continuously supplying "food and grass" and power. By the end of August, three hydraulic coal mining mines and 139 hydraulic coal mining working faces have been put into production nationwide, making China leap into the world's advanced field in this most modern coal mining technology with high efficiency, low cost, and guaranteed safety. At the same time, the number of small and medium-sized coal mines across the country has surged from more than 11,000 last year to 51,000 by the end of 1958, an increase of nearly four times. In this way, the national coal production will increase by 80 million tons this year, which is more than the total increase in production during the five years of the first five-year plan. In the petroleum pavilion, a model of China's largest artificial petroleum plant with an annual output of one million tons of oil, which was designed and built by ourselves, is on display. Many new and huge natural oil fields are under construction, and many small and medium-sized oil fields have also blossomed and bear fruit in various places. In terms of the power industry, the growth rate of the national power generation this year will exceed twice the average annual growth rate of the first five-year plan, and the new power generation equipment capacity added to the national power system this year will be 2.2 times that of 1957. Here, people can not only see the magnificent images of many huge hydropower stations and thermal power stations under construction, but also see many small rural hydropower stations using hydropower, biogas, wind power, and animal power to generate electricity by the Houhai Lake of the exhibition. These "night pearls" that are shining brightly in the vast countryside have illuminated the road to rural electrification.

The Geological Hall, located next to the Coal Hall, takes us into a splendid world of endless treasures. China has a vast territory and abundant resources, which is truly unparalleled in the world. After liberation, the proven reserves of various minerals in China have exceeded several times to dozens of times those of old China. The proven reserves of some minerals have increased dozens or even hundreds of times in the first few months of this year compared with the previous five years.

Large-scale production leaps forward, forcing "transportation to go first." In the railway and transportation exhibition halls, many physical objects, charts, and models on display tell the audience that China's land, sea, and air transportation industries are also advancing by leaps and bounds. Adapting to the needs of the motherland's industrial and mining construction and resource development, a growing and well-developed railway network, highway network, waterway transportation network, and air transportation network are increasingly closely linking China's vast cities, rural areas, and border areas.

Upstairs in the Mechanical Hall in the central hall, a colorful array of flowers is open - various textiles and light industrial products that supply the needs of the people's lives. Not only has the growth rate of China's textile industry and light industry greatly exceeded any year of the first five-year plan, but a large number of newer and more beautiful varieties have also been created in the first eight months of this year. The exhibition shows that while heavy industry is accelerating its development, the Chinese people will get more and better clothing and daily necessities from the textile and light industry sectors, so that they can live a better life.

With the overall leap forward of industry, China's industry is also leaping towards the world's advanced level. We excitedly visited the Atomic Energy Hall. Here are displayed models of China's first atomic reactor and cyclotron, as well as many self-made equipment and instruments. China has taken a big step in the peaceful use of atomic energy, the world's latest technological achievement.

We have walked through all fifteen pavilions, and before our eyes is a scene of a bumper harvest on China's industrial front. However, in the historical process of the great motherland "one day equaling twenty years," many new achievements, new inventions, and new creations exhibited at this exhibition have actually been replaced by more and newer achievements created by the vast number of workers. The staff of the exhibition told us that during the four months of preparation, although each pavilion has been revised again and again, and many exhibits have been replaced again and again, they still feel distressed because they cannot keep up with the vigorous leap forward situation. Therefore, some exhibition halls have set up special leap forward platforms or good news platforms, ready to display the latest crystallization of the labor and wisdom of the working masses at any time during the exhibition.

The most fundamental reason why China's industry can have such a leap forward situation of ten thousand horses galloping in just a few months is that it has conscientiously implemented the general line of socialist construction put forward by the Party, and implemented the policy of the whole Party running industry and the whole people running industry. Once the vast number of people are mobilized, it is like a divine dragon stirring the sea and a fierce tiger leaving the mountain. The slogan of the whole Party and the whole people running the steel industry has only been put forward for a few months, and more than 200,000 indigenous blast furnaces and small blast furnaces have been built across the country. Many places that did not produce a ton of steel in the past have now become steel towns with blooming steel flowers and rushing molten iron. The development of Beijing's machine tool industry is called "a spring breeze overnight fills the garden with spring." Five months ago, there were only two machine tool factories here manufacturing milling machines and planers, and now there are more than 30 factories producing machines. They concentrated the strength of state-owned enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, light industrial machine repair workshops, cooperatives and schools, and attacked the machine tool fortress with five troops. In just one month, they successfully manufactured 350 kinds of machine tools. Such examples can be seen everywhere in the various pavilions of the exhibition, and what is reflected in the exhibition is only a drop in the ocean of China's real life.

With the further implementation of the policy of the whole Party and the whole people running industry, and with the further development of the soaring enthusiasm of the 600 million people in industrial construction, China's industrial construction will be like surging waves, one wave impacting another, and leaping forward, leaping forward again and again at an even more astonishing speed.

    千帆竞发　万木争荣
    新华社记者　袁木　鲁音
    秋天是收获的季节。在一片农业大丰收的捷报声中，工业战线上也是红旗招展，战绩频传。各地职工给全国工业交通展览会送来的五万件展品，就好像无数闪光的珍珠，它们正在雄伟的北京展览馆和建筑展览馆内竞放异彩，争奇夺艳，显示了一幅工业大丰收的动人景象。
    这是我国历史上规模最大的展览会，十五个工业部门在这里布置了十五个馆，占地总面积约四万平方公尺。宏大的北京展览馆被全部布满还容纳不下，有四个馆分设在北京展览馆西南的建筑展览馆内。按照规定的路线，从第一个馆参观到最后的一个馆，仅仅在展览会内部的行程就有几十里路，如果你顺序走过每项展品，只是听完讲解员的简要说明，既不发问，也不留连，就得花去整整五天的时间。
    在全部展品中，绝大多数都是今年工业大跃进高潮中的产物，它们在展览会上构成了一幅“千帆竞发，万木争荣”的图景。人们从展览会上可以看到，为了建立我国独立的、强大的、完整的社会主义工业体系，工业部门的各行各业都在“竞发”“争荣”，互相保证，互相协作，互相促进。就在这种共产主义精神全面高涨的情况之下，我们才能从展览会上看到，中国人民在第一个五年计划中用超过一切资本主义国家的工业化速度写下了“五年胜过一百年”的史诗之后，今年又把钢产量由去年的五百三十五万吨跳到一千零七十万吨，机床由三万七千台激增到八万台，煤由一亿三千万吨增到二亿一千万吨，棉布由五十亿公尺增加到六十三亿公尺……这些数字的增长速度已经不是百分之十几，二十几，而是三十、四十、五十以至成倍地加番。中国人民在同资本主义国家的一场和平竞赛中，表现出来的惊人速度已经把他们远远地抛在后面。
    钢铁和机械是这场竞赛中的两个元帅。
    走进北京展览馆的朱红镶金大门，向左侧一拐，就是钢铁元帅的“营房”——冶金工业展览馆。在这里，一座四十三吨重的巨大钢锭端正地矗立在大厅的中央。它高三点九公尺，身粗足够三人合抱。人们走到它的面前仰首瞻望，不由得不对铸造出这样巨大的钢锭的炼钢工人肃然起敬。有了这样的钢锭，就可以为制造一切巨大的重型机械提供必需的锻件。真好像元帅升帐一样，环绕在巨人似的钢锭周围的，是几百种不同成分、不同形状的各种型钢。壁上悬挂的图表告诉人们，今年我国新增加的钢种就有一百二十八种，许多世界上最难冶炼、质量要求最高的钢种，大跃进中的中国炼钢工人都已能掌握它们的冶炼方法。不论在数量、质量和品种上，中国人民完全依靠自己的钢铁武装自己的那一天，已经是指日可待了！
    从冶金馆转入展览馆的中央大厅和东西广场，各种新式的重型机器和精密机床构成的一个强大机器工业的阵容，立刻闯进了我们的视线。在这里，我们看到了七百公厘的初轧机，它可以把两吨重的大钢锭轧成钢坯。而在它的旁边，矗立着一个差不多比它还大一倍的轧钢机模型，这台轧钢机不久也将制造成功。那台两千五百吨的水压机，可以加工重达四十多吨的巨大钢锭。在展览会筹备期间，这台设备还正在赶制，现在它已提前四个月在沈阳制造成功。两个月以前刚由哈尔滨锅炉厂制造出来的我国第一台二百三十吨高压锅炉，可以供给五万瓩发电站的全部动力，这里展出的这部锅炉缩小到十分之一的一个模型还有一丈多高，而它本身却有如十层大楼，没有一个展览馆能够安装得下。在这里，我们还看到了可以钻井一千二百公尺的全部石油钻井设备，基本建设工地和矿山上的巨人——一次可以挖土三立方公尺的高大电铲，以及工业和交通电讯等方面使用的最精密的各种电表仪器。
    四年以前，北京展览馆落成，苏联经济文化展览会第一次在这里展出，强大的苏联工业曾经吸引了几百万观众。那时，我国还没有独立的飞机汽车制造业，不能生产重型机器和精密机床，但是，仅仅是短短的四年，由于苏联的帮助和全国人民的努力，奇迹终于出现了。今天，人们从展览会上已经可以看到我国自己制造的飞机，几十种载重汽车和小轿车，可以在旱田、水田以至山地奔驰的各式各样的拖拉机。
    “用煤炭炼钢出油发电，向煤炭要吃要用要穿”，“祖国山河壮、遍地石油香”，“水能变电能，电能变万能”。在煤炭、电力和石油等三个展览馆内，这些动人的响亮口号，道出了全国煤矿、电业和石油工人的雄心，他们为了保证钢铁、机器两个元帅迅速升帐，满足国民经济各部门的需要，源源供应“粮草”和动力，正在加快跃进的步伐。到8月底止，全国已有三个水力采煤矿井、一百三十九个水力采煤工作面投入生产，使我国在这项效率高、成本低、保证安全的最现代化采煤技术上，一跃而跨入世界先进领域。与此同时，全国各地中小型煤矿已经由去年的一万一千多处跃增到1958年底的五万一千处，增加了近四倍。这样，全国煤炭产量今年就将增加八千万吨，比第一个五年计划期间五年的增产总量还多。在石油馆内，展出了我国自己设计和建设的世界上最大的年产百万吨石油的人造石油厂模型，不少新的巨大天然油田正在建设，很多中小型油田也已在各地开花结果。在电力工业方面，今年全国发电量的增长速度将超过第一个五年计划平均每年增长速度的一倍，全国电力系统今年新增加的发电设备容量将为1957年的二点二倍。在这里，人们不仅可以看到许多正在建设的巨大水电站和火电站的雄伟图景，而且在展览会的后湖边上，还可以看到利用水力、沼气、风力、畜力等发电的许多小型农村水电站。这些正在广大农村中大放光明的“夜明珠”，已经照亮了农村电气化的道路。
    设在煤炭馆旁边的地质馆，把我们带进了一个无尽宝藏的绚烂世界。中国地大物博，资源丰富，真是举世无双。解放后，我国探明的各种矿藏储量已经超过旧中国的几倍到几十倍，有的矿藏的探明储量，在今年前几个月中又比前五年增长了几十倍，甚至成百倍。
    大规模的生产跃进，逼迫“运输先行”。在铁路、交通两个展览馆内，展出的许多实物、图表和模型告诉观众，我国陆海空运输业也在飞跃前进。适应着祖国工矿建设和资源开发的需要，一个日益发展的四通八达的铁路网、公路网、水路交通网和航空运输网，正在越来越紧密地联系着我国的广大城市、农村和边疆。
    在中央大厅机械馆的楼上，开放着一片缤纷灿烂的各色花朵——供应人民生活需要的各种纺织品和轻工业品。我国纺织工业和轻工业不仅今年的增长速度都大大超过第一个五年计划的任何一年，今年前八个月也创制出了大批更新更美的花色品种。展览会显示，在重工业加快发展的同时，我国人民将从纺织和轻工业部门得到更多更好的衣着和日用品，让自己生活得更加美好。
    随着工业的全面跃进，我国的工业也正在向世界上的先进水平跃进。我们兴奋地参观了原子能馆。这里展出了我国第一个原子反应堆和回旋加速器的模型，还有许多自己制造的设备仪器，我国在和平利用原子能这一世界最新技术成就方面，已经跨出了一大步。
    我们走遍了十五个馆，眼前是我国工业战线上一片丰收的景象。但是，在伟大祖国“一天等于二十年”的历史进程中，在这次展览会上展出的许多新成就、新发明和新创造，实际上已经被广大职工创造出来的更多更新的战绩所代替。展览会的工作人员告诉我们，在四个月的筹备期间，虽然每个馆都一改再改，许多展品一换再换，他们仍然因为赶不上蓬勃的跃进形势而感到苦闷。因此，有些展览馆都专设了跃进台或报喜台，准备在展出期间随时陈列职工群众劳动和智慧的最新结晶。
    我国工业在短短的几个月里能够出现这样万马奔腾的跃进局面，最根本的原因是认真贯彻了党所提出的社会主义建设总路线，实行了全党办工业全民办工业的方针。广大人民一经发动起来，就如神龙搅海，猛虎离山，全党全民办钢铁工业的口号提出才几个月，全国就办起了二十多万个土高炉和小高炉，不少过去不产一吨钢铁的地方，现在已经变成了钢花怒放、铁水奔流的钢铁之乡。北京机床工业的发展被称为“一夜春风满园春色”。五个月以前，这里只有两家机床厂制造铣床刨床，现在已有三十多个工厂在生产机器。他们集中了国营企业、公私合营企业、轻工业机修车间、合作社和学校的力量，五路大军齐攻机床堡垒，只一个月的时间就制成功了三百五十种机床。像这样的例子在展览会的各个馆里到处可见，而反映到展览会上来的只不过是我国现实生活中的沧海一粟。
    随着全党全民办工业这条方针的进一步贯彻，随着六亿人民在工业建设上进一步发挥冲天的干劲，我国工业建设将像汹涌的海涛，一浪冲击一浪，以更加惊人的速度跃进跃进再跃进。
