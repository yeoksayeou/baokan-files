Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th - The Soviet Union's Political and Scientific Knowledge Dissemination Association held a commemorative meeting tonight to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Satiukov, Vice-Chairman of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, pointed out in his speech that the Soviet people unanimously support Khrushchev's warning in his letter to Eisenhower: An aggression against China is an aggression against the Soviet Union. Satiukov said that the Soviet people will join the Chinese people in dealing a devastating blow to the imperialists. He said with passionate excitement: "Chinese brothers! We will always be together to fight for the cause of socialism and communism." When he spoke of the great achievements of the Chinese people in the past nine years, the Great Leap Forward in China, and the task of catching up with Britain, the audience constantly applauded enthusiastically.

Ambassador Liu Xiao also spoke at the meeting. He said that the Soviet Union's assistance to China, and the Soviet Union's advanced experience, have blossomed and borne fruit on China's socialist land.

Ambassador Liu Xiao then said that due to the continuous military provocations by US imperialism against our country, the situation in the Taiwan Strait area is further deteriorating, and peace in the Far East and the world is being seriously threatened. The Chinese government has repeatedly issued warnings for this reason, urging the American aggressors to stop playing with fire and not to get burned. The Chinese government has also stated that it is willing to resolve the disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan region through peaceful negotiations. The Chinese people must never give up their sacred and inviolable right to defend their territorial sovereignty. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, Jinmen, and Mazu! The Chinese people demand that the United States immediately withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area and stop interfering in China's internal affairs. The Chinese people love peace, but they are never afraid of war. If US imperialism insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, the Chinese people will rise up in unison to fight to defend their motherland and to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. We sincerely thank the Soviet people for their strong support of our people. The fraternal and unbreakable friendship between our two countries will exert its greatest strength and form the strongest iron fist to crush any aggressive conspiracy of the imperialists.

Some scholars and actors who had been to China introduced the situation of the Great Leap Forward in China with vivid facts at the meeting, which made the whole audience extremely excited, and the masses repeatedly applauded enthusiastically and stood up.

    苏联政治和科学普及协会集会庆祝我国国庆
    携手建设共产主义  并肩反对美国侵略
    刘晓大使感谢苏联人民对我国正义斗争的支持
    新华社莫斯科26日电  苏联政治和科学普及协会今晚举行纪念会庆祝中华人民共和国建国九周年。苏中友好协会副主席萨丘科夫在他的讲话中指出，苏联人民一致拥护赫鲁晓夫致艾森豪威尔的信中所提出的警告：对中国的侵犯就是对苏联的侵犯。萨丘科夫说，苏联人民将同中国人民一起给帝国主义者以毁灭性的打击。他热情激昂地说：“中国兄弟！我们将永远在一起为社会主义与共产主义事业而奋斗”。当他讲到中国人民九年来的伟大成就、中国的大跃进以及赶上英国的任务时观众不断热烈的鼓掌。
    刘晓大使在会上也讲了话。他说，苏联对中国的援助，苏联的先进经验已在中国的社会主义土地上很好的开花结果。
    刘晓大使接着说，由于美帝国主义不断向我国进行军事挑衅，台湾海峡地区的局势在进一步恶化，远东和世界和平遭到严重的威胁。我国政府为此曾多次发出警告，要美国侵略者停止玩火，不要引火烧身。我国政府也表示，愿意通过和平谈判的方式解决中美两国在台湾地区的争端。中国人民绝不能放弃自己的保卫领土主权完整的神圣不可侵犯的权利。中国人民一定要解放台湾、金门和马祖！中国人民要求美国立即从台湾和台湾海峡地区撤出一切武装力量，停止干涉中国内政。中国人民热爱和平，但是决不怕战争。如果美帝国主义硬要把战争加在中国人民的头上，中国人民将一致奋起为保卫祖国而战，为维护远东和世界的和平而战。我们衷心感谢苏联人民对我国人民的有力支持。我们两国之间兄弟般牢不可破的友谊将发挥它最伟大的力量，形成最坚强的铁拳来粉碎帝国主义者的任何侵略阴谋。
    有些曾到过中国的学者和演员在会上以生动的事实介绍了中国大跃进的情况，使全场兴奋异常，群众累次热烈鼓掌不断起立。
