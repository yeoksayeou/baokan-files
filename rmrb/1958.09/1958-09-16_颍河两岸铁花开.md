    Iron Flowers Bloom on Both Banks of the Ying River
    He Jiguang

    When the Ying River People's Commune Committee of Dengfeng County proposed to vigorously develop the iron and steel industry, the broad masses were full of confidence, the doubters remained coldly indifferent, and the vanguard of the conservatives came out and aired their fallacies. The commune committee, in light of the overall situation, launched several major debates among cadres and the masses. During the debate on "Does our commune have the conditions to vigorously develop the iron and steel industry?", an old technical worker named Uncle He, who had been involved in iron smelting, stood up to speak. Based on his decades of "experience," he opened his mouth with more than a dozen "impossibles," advising everyone: "The coal from Qu River is no good for smelting iron; the ore from Qu River is no good for smelting iron; learning in half a year like the October folks want to smelt iron, that's even more impossible! It takes four years of study to barely be passable, two years to dig ditches, and four years to smelt iron; you need machines for blowing air, without that it's impossible; the furnace has to be shut down after burning for three days, not shutting it down is impossible; rain is impossible; hot weather is impossible; wind is impossible; not eating enough is impossible; building so many furnaces without money is impossible. Livestock need fodder, people need food, smelting iron needs money." As he shook his head and voiced these typical conservative arguments to the commune members with an air of experience, the masses responded with a burst of laughter: "In the past, you could say hundreds of impossibles, but this is not an era of impossibles." On the spot, commune member Wang Youli stood up and said to him: "Uncle, you say this is impossible and that is impossible, you say I need four years to learn to smelt iron, you watch, if I don't learn it in ten days, I won't be named Wang."
    After the debate, although the conservatives were not entirely convinced, the broad masses, under the leadership of the Party, enthusiastically began to vigorously develop the iron and steel industry.
    The commune committee decided to use facts to teach the conservatives a lesson.
    The Party committee sent a large number of capable cadres to this work, with the Third Secretary taking the lead, two township heads joining the battle, and twelve brigade leaders participating. They mobilized 20,000 people to transport materials, thousands to build, and formed four large teams: a furnace construction team, a material supply team, a material preparation team, and a wooden blower team. They formed an Iron and Steel Command and designated an Iron and Steel Experimental Plot. After three days and three nights of hard work, what were the results?
    They completed twenty blast furnaces and two hundred and fifty earthen blast furnaces three days ahead of schedule. Some have already been put into production, producing 1.8 million jin of iron.
    The masses' creativity surged, and for blowers alone, there were six types: animal-pulled, hand-cranked, foot-pedaled, bellows-pulled, water-powered, and natural wind.
    All the materials used for building the furnaces were donated by the masses; the commune did not spend a single penny. Bricks were taken from the gates, arches, brick walls, and brick beds. If there were no refractory bricks, refractory stones were used instead. More than 10,000 women in the commune, from elderly women in their sixties and seventies to young girls of eleven and twelve, also came to support.
    On both banks of the Ying River: during the day, transporting materials was like twisting into a rope; at night, the mountains were brightly lit; cadres and masses lined up, and wind and rain did not stop them.
    The red-hot molten iron flowed out! The conservatives saw it with their own eyes. They burned coal from Qu River; they smelted ore from Qu River. Even after days and nights of rain, the iron output increased with the efforts of the workers. The furnace burned for eight days and eight nights without shutting down, and the molten iron continued to flow. Take a look at the technical workers, under the guidance of the Party committee's principle of building and learning at the same time, Wang Youli's boast became a reality, and he became an expert. Old carpenters in their sixties and seventies also changed their profession and became iron smelting workers.
    What did Uncle He say? The hot molten iron finally melted his hard head. He is now participating in the work of the iron smelting plant in Zhu Jiawan. Workers reported: "This old man is very active now!" He told the Party committee: "From now on, I must take out all my technology, can I take the technology to the coffin? If I, the old man, am still conservative, you can debate me as much as you want, and it's okay to punish me according to the law." His feet were burned by the furnace charcoal, but he still sat at the furnace entrance, watching the heat.
    Now, all the masses of the Ying River People's Commune are fighting with full confidence "to open iron flowers on both banks of the Ying River!"

    颍河两岸铁花开
    何继光
    当登封县颍河人民公社党委提出大办钢铁工业时，广大群众信心百倍，怀疑派冷冷淡淡，保守派中的急先锋则摇摇摆摆出来发表谬论。社委针对全社情况，在干部和群众中展开了几场大辩论。在辩论“我们社有没有条件大办钢铁工业？”时，有一个先前炼铁的技术工人何老伯站出来说话了。他以几十年的“经验”，张口就是十几个“不中”，劝告大家：“咱这儿曲河的煤炼铁不中；曲河的矿炼铁也不中；学十月半年就想炼铁，那还中？学得四年才算马马虎虎凑得上数，二年点沟，四年才炼铁；得要有机器鼓风，没有那算不中；炉子烧三天得熄火，不熄不中；天下雨不中；天老热不中；刮风不中；吃不饱不中；修这么些炉子没钱不中。牲口要料，人要饭，炼铁要钱。”当他以饱有经验的姿态向社员摇头发表这些典型的保守论点时，群众报之以一阵嘲笑“过去呀，你可以说几百个不中，这阵儿，就不是不中的时代。”当场，社员王有立就站起来，对他说：“老伯，你说这不中那不中，俺要学四年才能炼铁，你瞧着吧，我十天学不会就不姓王。”
    经过辩论，保守派虽然还不怎么服气，但广大的群众却在党的领导下，热火朝天地大办起钢铁工业来了。
    社党委决定要用事实，给保守派一个教训。
    党委派了大批有能力的干部投入这项工作，三书记挂帅，两乡长上阵，十二个大队长参战。动员了两万人运料，数千人修建，组成四个大队：建炉专业队，物质供应专业队，备料专业队，木制鼓风机专业队。组成钢铁指挥部，确定钢铁试验田。经过三天三夜的苦战，结果怎样呢？
    提前三天建成高炉二十个，土高炉二百五十个。已有部分投入生产，出铁一百八十万斤。
    群众创造风起云涌，仅鼓风机来说，就有：牲口拉的、手摇的、脚蹬的、风箱拉的、水打的、自来风的六种。
    建炉所用的全部材料都是群众献出来的，社里没有花半分钱。砖，是寨门、牌坊、砖墙、砖炕上扒的砖。没有耐火砖就用耐火石代替。全社一万多妇女，上至六、七十的老婆婆，下至十一、二的小闺女，也都来支援。
    颍河两岸上是：白天运料拧成一股绳，夜晚山上山下灯火一片明，干部群众排开阵，刮风下雨也不停。
    红通通的铁水流出来啦！保守派是亲眼看见的。烧的是，曲河的煤；炼的是，曲河的矿。连下了几天几夜的雨，在工人们的努力下，出铁量反而多了。炉子烧了八天八夜，没有熄火，铁水照样奔流。再看看技术工人吧，在党委的边建边学的方针指导下，王有立夸下的海口成为现实了，他成了内行。六、七十的老木工也改行成了炼铁工人。
    何老伯怎么说呢？热腾腾的铁水终于溶化了他那硬梆梆的头脑。他现在正在朱家湾参加炼铁厂的工作。工人反映：“这老头子现在可积极了！”他向党委表示：“从今以后我一定要把全部技术拿出来，我还能把技术带进棺材去？我老头要是再保守，你们尽管辩论我，法办也中。”他的脚被炉炭烧坏了，但仍然坐在炉门口，守着火候。
    现在，颍河人民公社的全体群众，正信心万倍地“为颍河两岸开铁花”而奋斗！
