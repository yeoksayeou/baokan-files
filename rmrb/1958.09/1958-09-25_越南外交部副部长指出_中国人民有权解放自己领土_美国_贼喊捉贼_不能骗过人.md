Supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's Statement; Denouncing the U.S. "Ceasefire" Plot
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 24th. Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Ung Van Khiem, speaking to Xinhua reporters today, expressed his full support and warm welcome for Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement refuting U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's speech at the United Nations General Assembly.

Ung Van Khiem said that the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam completely sympathize with and support the Chinese government and people's iron will to liberate Jinmen and Mazu, as well as to liberate Taiwan and the Penghu Islands.

He said that Dulles's speech on September 18th at the United Nations General Assembly regarding the situation in the Taiwan area was a complete case of the thief crying "stop thief." This is an open and blatant distortion of the facts by the aggressors. Their aim in slandering the People's Republic of China is to cover up their conspiracy to increase troops and create tension in the Taiwan area, threaten the Chinese mainland, and obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Jinmen, Mazu, and their other islands. Dulles also proposed a "ceasefire" argument. This is just a cunning trick to confuse China's internal affairs issue of liberating Jinmen and Mazu and punishing the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique with the international dispute between China and the United States in the Taiwan area. There is no war between China and the United States, so there is no "ceasefire" issue. The U.S. imperialists' proposal of this unreasonable argument is obviously intended to deceive world public opinion, shift the responsibility for creating tension in the Taiwan area to China, and attempt to obstruct the ongoing Sino-U.S. negotiations. At the same time, they continue to concentrate armed forces and strengthen provocative actions, making the situation in the region even more serious.

He said that the U.S. imperialists' distortion of the facts cannot deceive anyone. The Vietnamese people believe that the 600 million Chinese people, with determination and unity, and with the strong sympathy and support of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, the people of Asia and Africa, and peace-loving people of the world, will surely smash U.S. imperialist aggression.

    支持陈毅外长声明  痛斥美国“停火”阴谋
    越南外交部副部长指出
    中国人民有权解放自己领土
    美国“贼喊捉贼”不能骗过人
    新华社河内24日电  越南民主共和国外交部副部长雍文谦今天对新华社记者发表谈话时，表示完全支持和热烈欢迎中国外交部长陈毅驳斥美国国务卿杜勒斯在联合国大会上发言的声明。
    雍文谦说，越南民主共和国政府和人民，完全同情和支持中国政府和人民决心解放金门、马祖以及解放台湾和澎湖列岛的钢铁般的意志。
    他说，杜勒斯9月18日在联合国大会上关于台湾地区局势的发言，完全是贼喊捉贼的言论。这是侵略者的明目张胆的歪曲事实的言论。他们诬蔑中华人民共和国的目的，是要掩饰他们增兵制造台湾地区的紧张局势以及威胁中国大陆和阻挠中国人民解放金门、马祖和自己的其他岛屿的阴谋。杜勒斯还提出了“停火”的论调。这只是企图把解放金门、马祖和惩罚蒋介石叛国集团这个中国的内政问题，同中国和美国在台湾地区的争端这个国际问题混为一谈的狡猾的手段。中国和美国之间没有战争，所以“停火”问题是不存在的。美帝国主义者提出这种无理的论调，显然是为了欺骗世界舆论，把制造台湾地区的紧张局势的责任转嫁给中国，企图阻挠正在进行中的中美谈判。就在这个时候，他们还继续在集中武装力量，加强挑衅行动，使这个地区的局势更加严重。
    他说，美帝国主义者歪曲事实的论调不能欺骗任何人。越南人民相信，有决心和团结一致的以及有着以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国、亚非人民和世界爱好和平人民强烈的同情和支持的六亿中国人民，必将粉碎美帝国主义的侵略。
