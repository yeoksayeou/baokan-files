Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 18th: The Garp Highway, which traverses the Ngari Prefecture in western Tibet and was constructed with funds from the State Council, has officially opened to traffic.

	This highway starts from Gadaq, the terminus of the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway, extends southward along the Gangdis Mountains, and reaches Pulan County at the foot of the Himalayas, with a total length of 255 kilometers. The Garp Highway is the first highway in the Ngari region, connecting the vast pastures in western Ngari with the agricultural areas in the south. Its opening to traffic will greatly promote the exchange of agricultural, pastoral, and local specialty products in the area, creating conditions for further development of this region.

	The Garp Highway crosses more than a dozen rivers, bypasses lake areas, and passes through mountains and valleys over 5,000 meters above sea level, making the project arduous. However, thanks to the vigorous efforts of the vast number of road construction workers, many difficulties were overcome, and the entire project was completed in just three months.

    贯通西藏西部阿里地区
    噶普公路通车
    新华社拉萨18日电　由国务院拨款修建的一条横穿西藏西部阿里地区的噶普公路，已经正式通车。
    这条公路从新藏公路的终点噶大克开始，沿冈底斯山脉南伸，直抵喜马拉雅山麓的普兰宗，全长二百五十五公里。噶普公路是阿里境内的第一条公路，它把阿里西部辽阔的牧场和南部农业区联系在一起，通车后将大大促进这里的农、牧、土特产品的交流，为进一步开发这个地区创造了条件。
    噶普公路跨过十几道河流，绕过湖群地带，穿过拔海五千多公尺的山岭和峡谷，工程艰巨。但在广大修路职工奋力苦战下，克服了许多困难，只用三个月的时间就全部修成。
