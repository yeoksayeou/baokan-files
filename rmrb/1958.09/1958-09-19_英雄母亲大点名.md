The Taiwan Strait roars with cannons, American bandits invade Jinmen.
At the heroic mother's command, the mountain village echoes with reports throughout the night.
The good sons the mother has protected, once made the Japanese die at the gate!
The good lads the mother has sheltered, once chased Chiang's bandits into the sea!
The iron fists the mother has nurtured, once taught the old American devils,
Heads swollen and faces bruised, fleeing south, teeth scattered across the Korean land!
A roll call of heroic mothers, the Taihang Mountains are full of soldiers.
The command echoes to the heavens, shaking the stars, the footfalls shake the earth, rolling the rivers and seas!

    英雄母亲大点名
    阮章竞台湾海峡大炮响，美国强盗犯金门。英雄母亲一声令，山村彻夜报到声。妈妈护过的好子弟，曾叫日本人在门前死！妈妈保过的好儿郎，曾追得蒋贼落海去！妈妈抚过的铁拳头，曾教美国老鬼子，头肿脸青往南逃，门牙落满朝鲜地！英雄母亲大点名，太行山上尽是兵。口令冲天星摇晃，脚声震地江海滚！
