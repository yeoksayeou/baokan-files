Street Poetry Collection from Li Jiaqu, Yan'an
　　Compiled by Yan Ling
    From the banks of the Yan River to the deep mountain gullies, a large-scale mass movement—the establishment of people's communes—swept through the rural areas of Yan'an like a thunderbolt. The Yan'an County Party Committee originally planned to pilot a people's commune in Li Jiaqu Township, Guaimao District, with a planned establishment time of ten days. However, as soon as the comrades of the working group opened their mouths in some villages and towns, more than 95% of the farmers, merchants, and handicraftsmen signed up. In four days, this commune was established. What was even more unexpected was that in these four days, the masses in various townships throughout the district received the news, and more than 95% of the households also couldn't wait to apply for the establishment and joining of communes; among them, there was only one township with one household that had not yet signed up. People knocked on the door of the township party committee secretary's house in the middle of the night, banging gongs and drums, demanding to establish a commune; the township party committee secretary hurriedly got up to open the door, and people outside shouted: "Secretary, you are lagging behind!"
    Roll after roll of red and green paper—big-character posters, declarations of determination, applications, and news of victory—were sent to Li Jiaqu Town, the seat of the Guaimao District Committee. In this colorful garden, how many wonderful flowers there are!
    Up another floor
　　Small villages and small cooperatives are difficult to spread their wings,
　　People's communes fly high.
　　The people of the whole township are rejoicing,
　　From now on, we are up another floor.
　　              (Fengzhuang Township)
    The Commune is Good
　　We've been looking forward to it day after day, month after month, year after year,
　　We've finally established the commune today.
　　The commune is like a red sun,
　　Shining on everyone's heart and making it blossom,
　　Shining on everyone and adding to their strength.
　　There are universities for learning,
　　There are theaters for watching plays,
　　We eat in the canteen,
　　We get clothes from the clothing store,
　　We plow the fields with machines,
　　We irrigate the fields with pumping stations,
　　The river water generates electricity,
　　The machines turn by themselves.
　　      (Hou'anjiatun Agricultural Cooperative)
    A Gift to the Commune
　　Small cooperatives and small families are like small clothes,
　　When people grow up, they have to change their clothes.
　　Chairman Mao says the commune is good,
　　We want to fly to the sky on the commune.
　　Hearing about the establishment of the commune,
　　Everyone is happy,
　　We take good care of the autumn fields,
　　We deeply plow the wheat fields,
　　We work hard for two nights,
　　Accumulating a million fertilizer;
　　We build another dam,
　　To present a gift to the commune.
　　          (Wufeng Agricultural Cooperative)

　　延安李家渠街头诗钞
  　燕凌辑
    从延河两岸到深山小沟，延安农村里以迅雷之势掀起了一个大规模的群众运动——建立人民公社。延安县委原来打算先在拐峁区李家渠乡试办一个人民公社，预定的建社时间是十天。可是，工作组的同志们到了一些村镇里刚一开腔，就有95％以上的农户、商户、手工业者报了名。四天时间，这个公社就建成了。更意料不到的是，就在这四天里，全区各乡的群众得到了消息，95％以上的户也都迫不及待地申请建立公社、加入公社；其中有一个乡只有一户还没有报名。人们半夜里到乡党委书记的门外敲锣打鼓要求办公社；乡党委书记急忙起来开门，门外还高喊着：“书记呀，你落后了！”
    一卷又一卷红红绿绿的纸张——大字报、决心书、申请书、喜报，送到了拐峁区委所在地李家渠镇。在这彩色缤纷的花园里，有多少美妙的鲜花啊！
    又上楼一层
　　小村小社难展翅，
　　人民公社飞得高。
　　全乡人民齐欢腾，
　　从今又上楼一层。
　　              （冯庄乡）
    公社好
　　年盼月盼日日盼，
　　盼到今天把公社办。
　　公社好似红太阳，
　　照得人人心花放，
　　照得人人力气添。
　　学习有大学，
　　看戏有剧院，
　　吃饭进食堂，
　　穿衣进衣店，
　　犁地开机器，
　　浇地抽水站，
　　河水发了电，
　　机器自己转。
　　      （后安家屯农业社）
    向公社献礼
　　小社小家好像小衣衫，
　　人长大了要把衣服换。
　　毛主席说公社好，
　　我们要驾着公社飞上天。
　　听说办公社，
　　人人心喜欢，
　　秋田好好管，
　　麦地深深翻，
　　苦战两夜晚，
　　积肥一百万；
　　再打一个坝，
　　向公社把礼献。
　　          （五丰农业社）
