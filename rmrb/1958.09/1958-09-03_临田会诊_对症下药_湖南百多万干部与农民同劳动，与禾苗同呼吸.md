New Hunan Daily News: Cadres and masses throughout Hunan Province are universally going deep into the fields, tightly grasping the key of field management, determined to have the late rice surpass the early rice, and striving for an overall bumper harvest in agricultural production.

In order to strengthen specific leadership, promptly discover and solve problems, and promote production, many regions have county party first secretaries personally taking charge and camping on the edge of the fields. According to incomplete statistics from Xiangtan, Hengyang, Shaoyang, and Chenxian Special Districts and the Autonomous Prefecture, more than 1,184,000 cadres at five levels have already been organized to go deep into the fields, labor alongside the farmers, and share the breath of the rice seedlings. The Xinhua County Party Committee proposed: "If the grain doesn't enter the granary, the cadres won't go home; we will not withdraw our troops until a complete victory is won." According to surveys in eight counties including Changning in the Hengyang Special District, there are currently more than 287,000 cadres and commune members who have built 120,000 sheds in the fields. In Pingjiang County, not only have cadres gone deep into the fields, but also peddlers and doctors have gone deep into the fields. This has further encouraged the masses' confidence and determination to strive for a bumper harvest. Some of the masses in Hengnan County even happily sing: "The Communist Party is a good example; leading cadres go down to the fields; three tree branches build a factory; four bricks build a bed; meetings are moved to the edge of the fields; work and production are both busy; working hard day and night without complaint, only for the late rice to yield more grain; we must work even harder and launch satellites into the fields." On the shed of Cao Mujing, the party secretary of Dazhou Township in Pingjiang, commune members posted a big-character poster: "The secretary sleeps in the fields, which is rarely seen; the cadres go into the sea, and we can capture dragons; we grow with the crops in the morning and sleep with the seedlings at night; we are determined not to be afraid of difficulties in achieving a yield of 20,000 catties per mu." The cadres also said with feeling: "In the past, we relied on telephone reports to guide our work, but now that we go deep into the fields, we can solve problems more specifically and practically through seeing and hearing for ourselves. This is truly a command post and a promotion shed."

In order to ensure that late rice surpasses early rice, all localities attach great importance to the processing and cultivation of late rice. After four days and nights of hard work, Luoshi Township in Changning achieved "three-izations" in the entire township, namely, self-flowing irrigation, self-flowing soil medicine for pest control and mechanization, and self-flowing liquid fertilizer. They fertilize once every two days, and each mu has been fertilized with an average of 1,500 dan of fertilizer. Currently, the seedlings are generally closing ranks and growing well. Many agricultural cooperatives in Chenxian and Hengyang Special Districts are carrying out activities of inserting red flags and pulling out white flags in the fields, adopting the method of "on-the-spot consultations and prescribing the right medicine," which has achieved great results. According to statistics from 7,430,000 mu of late rice in Xiangtan, Changde, Shaoyang, and Qianyang Special Districts, more than 1,280,000 mu of third-class seedlings have now had more than 1,010,000 mu upgraded to first- and second-class seedlings. Shaoyang and Chenxian Special Districts have basically completed the first cultivation and topdressing and are carrying out the second one. In other regions, cultivation and topdressing are also over 70%, and the first prevention and control of pests has been carried out universally, with some places having carried out prevention and control two or three times. In order to make the movement more in-depth and more solid, all localities are widely and deeply carrying out a mass-based large-scale inspection, large-scale evaluation, and large-scale competition movement.

　　临田会诊　对症下药
    湖南百多万干部与农民同劳动，与禾苗同呼吸
    新湖南报消息　湖南省各地干部和群众普遍深入田间，紧紧抓住田间管理关，一定要晚稻超过早稻，力争农业生产的全面大丰收。
    为了加强具体领导，及时发现解决问题，推动生产，很多地区都是县委第一书记亲自挂帅在田边扎营，据湘潭、衡阳、邵阳、郴县专区和自治州的不完全统计，目前已组织了五级干部一百一十八万四千多人深入田间，与农民同劳动，与禾苗共呼吸。新化县委提出：“粮食不入库，干部不回家，不获全胜，决不收兵”。衡阳专区据常宁等八个县了解，目前已有二十八万七千多个干部及社员在田间搭了十二万个棚子。平江县不但干部深入田间，货郎担、医生也深入到田间，这样做更加鼓舞了群众争取丰产的信心和决心。衡南县有的群众更乐意地唱道：“共产党好榜样，领导干部下田间，三根树叉搭个厂，四块砖头架个床，会议搬到田边开，工作生产两头忙，日夜忙碌不辞劳，只为晚稻多打粮，我们更要加油干，发射卫星到田间。”平江大洲乡党委书记曹慕景的棚子上，贴上了社员写的大字报：“书记睡田间，历来很少见，干部下得海，我们能擒龙，朝和作物生长，晚和禾苗睡眠，亩产两万斤，坚决不畏难。”干部也感慨的说：“过去依靠电话汇报指导工作，现在深入田间，耳闻目睹，能更具体更实际地解决问题，真是一个指挥棚，促进棚。”
    为了确保晚稻超过早稻，各地对晚稻的加工培育非常重视。常宁罗市乡经过苦战四昼夜，全乡实现了“三化”，即水利自流化，土药杀虫自流、机械化，液体肥料自流化。他们每隔两天进行一次追肥，每亩平均已追肥一千五百担，目前，禾苗普遍封行，生长良好。郴县、衡阳专区许多农业社，正在田间开展插红旗，拔白旗的运动，采取“临田会诊，对症下药”的办法，成绩很大。据湘潭、常德、邵阳、黔阳四个专区的七百四十三万亩晚稻的统计，原有一百二十八万多亩三类禾苗，现在已有一百零一万多亩上升为一、二类禾苗。邵阳、郴县专区第一次中耕追肥已基本搞完，正在进行第二次，其余地区中耕追肥也在70％以上，并且普遍对虫害进行了第一次防治，多的地方已防治了两、三次。为了使运动更深入、更扎实地前进，各地正在广泛深入地开展一个群众性的大检查、大评比、大竞赛运动。
