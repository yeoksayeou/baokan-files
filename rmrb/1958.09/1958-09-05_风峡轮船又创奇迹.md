　　Fengxia Steamer Creates Another Miracle
    The Fengxia wheel steamer, which had previously towed 3,000-ton large iron barges four times consecutively on the Yangtze River, has recently created another miracle. Not long ago, the Fengxia wheel towed three large iron barges, sailing downstream from Chongqing. This fleet, 120 meters long and with a load capacity of 4,945 tons, overcame the Yangtze River's dangerous shoals and arrived safely in Yichang. After arriving in Yichang, two more iron barges were added, bringing the total load to 7,396 tons, and sailed directly to Hankou.

　　风峡轮船又创奇迹
    在川江上连续四次拖带三千吨大铁驳的风峡轮，最近又创奇迹，不久以前，风峡轮拖了三条大铁驳，从重庆顺江而下。这个船队长一百二十公尺，载重四千九百四十五吨，战胜了川江天险，安抵宜昌。到宜昌后又加拖两个铁驳，载重七千三百九十六吨，直驰汉口。
