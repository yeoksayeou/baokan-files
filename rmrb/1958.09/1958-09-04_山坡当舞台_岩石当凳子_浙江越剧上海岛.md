　　Hillsides as Stages, Rocks as Seats
    Zhejiang Opera Goes to Islands
    The Zhejiang Yue Opera Troupe braved the summer heat, crossed the ocean, and went to the islands to perform for the People's Liberation Army, giving great encouragement to the coastal defense soldiers. In order to avoid impacting the troops' combat training, and also to ensure that the soldiers could see the performances, they proposed the slogan "Bring the performances to the front lines." Although the actors had to stay up until around midnight every night, they would get up early the next morning and split into several groups, carrying props and instruments, climbing mountains and crossing ridges to perform for the soldiers. They used hillsides as stages, rocks as seats, and climbed the rugged paths to the mountaintops to sing. They also labored alongside the soldiers. Famous actors Zhang Yin, Tu Xiaofei, Chen Peiqing, and others performed six or seven programs in half a day. They also collected advanced deeds from the soldiers and composed and sang songs on the spot. When the soldiers saw the deeds of their own units or themselves turned into plays, they were even more overjoyed. The soldiers wrote letters to the troupe, expressing their determination to respond to the warm concern of the broad masses of the people and the troupe with practical actions.

　　山坡当舞台　岩石当凳子
    浙江越剧上海岛
    浙江越剧一团冒着炎暑，跨越海洋，到海岛为解放军演出，给海防战士很大的鼓舞。为了使部队不影响战斗训练，又要使战士能看到戏，他们提出了“把戏送上前沿阵地”的口号。虽然演员们每天晚上要到十二点左右才能入睡，但第二天一早又分成几个小组，拿着道具、乐器，爬山越岭去为战士们演出。他们把山坡当舞台，岩石当凳子，攀登着崎岖小道上山顶去演唱。她们还与战士们一齐劳动。著名演员张茵、屠笑飞、陈佩卿等在一个半天内就演出了六、七个节目。她们还在战士那里收集先进事迹现编现唱。当战士们看到本单位或自己的事迹被编成戏的时候，更是欢欣若狂。战士们纷纷写信给剧团表示要以实际行动来回答广大人民和剧团的热情关怀。
