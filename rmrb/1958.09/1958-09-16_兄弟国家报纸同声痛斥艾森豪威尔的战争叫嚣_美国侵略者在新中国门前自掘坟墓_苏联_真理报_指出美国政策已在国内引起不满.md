Xinhua News Agency, September 14th—Newspapers in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria have recently published commentaries in the past two days, condemning Eisenhower's televised speech on the situation in the Taiwan Strait.

    The Czechoslovakian "Red Right Daily" stated in an article on the 13th that Eisenhower's radio speech was merely an attempt to distort the facts and create excuses for a long-term escalation of aggression against China. This speech admitted that the United States does not intend to abandon its role as a gendarme, opposing national liberation movements around the world without hesitation.

    The newspaper pointed out that the Chinese people, with their just determination to liberate their own territory, are not at all intimidated by American threats and provocations. Aggressors can only dig their own graves at the doorstep of New China. On the 14th, "Red Right Daily," in a commentary criticizing Eisenhower's attempt to use the Munich incident to justify American aggression in the Taiwan area, resolutely condemned his shameful act of inverting historical facts and distorting the tragic experience of the Czechoslovakian nation.

    The commentary cited numerous conclusive facts to expose the American government's assistance to Hitler's aggressive policies and its role as an accomplice in the Munich incident. The commentary emphasized that the Czechoslovakian people, who suffered heavy sacrifices, have the right to warn the world that the Munich incident proves that the Chinese people are fully entitled not to make any concessions to the American aggressors.

    The Polish "People's Tribune" wrote in a commentary on the 13th that anyone who holds the view of safeguarding the sovereignty of all countries and maintaining peace cannot accept the arguments put forward by the American President for the actions of American troops in the Taiwan area. The newspaper went on to write that Eisenhower's comparison of the People's Republic of China's desire to liberate its own territory of Taiwan and coastal islands with the policies of fascist countries before World War II is an insult to the People's Republic of China.

    The Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily" said in a commentary entitled "Eisenhower's War Provocation Program" that no peace-lover can harbor illusions about Eisenhower's speech. Eisenhower's speech contained both menacing threats to China and attempts to portray America's aggressive policies as peaceful. The American President's efforts created a heap of confused words, slanders, and distortions.

    The Romanian "Spark" newspaper on the 14th commented on Eisenhower's television broadcast speech under the title "Fine Words Behind the Cannons." The commentary pointed out that Eisenhower said he was forced to use force to "defend" America's vital interests. This barbaric policy reminds people of Hitler and Mussolini twenty years ago.

    An article in the Bulgarian "Workers' Cause Daily" stated that Eisenhower's speech was purely a distortion of facts and a shameless slander and defamation of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. However, this does not help the aggressors in the slightest. If the American imperialists dare to launch an armed invasion of the People's China, they will inevitably suffer a devastating blow.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 15th—The "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 15th stating that Eisenhower's reply to Khrushchev proves that the American authorities are still stubbornly adhering to a policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, completely violating the wishes of the American people and peace-loving people around the world who demand that the United States immediately cease its provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait and the Far East.

    The commentary pointed out that, for the purpose of aggression, the United States even demanded that China "renounce the use of force" in the Taiwan Strait, that is, that the Chinese people abandon their own territory and sovereignty. This absurd argument can only show that the United States stubbornly insists on interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and mixes up the internal affairs of the Chinese people with the international disputes caused by the United States in the Taiwan Strait. This trick cannot deceive anyone.

    The commentary pointed out that the only way to maintain peace in the Far East at present is for the American military to immediately withdraw from the Taiwan Strait. If the United States continues to act perversely, it will only aggravate its own crimes and suffer the consequences.

    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 14th—The Mongolian "Truth Daily" published a commentary on the 14th pointing out that Eisenhower's television speech on the 11th more blatantly exposed the war provocation conspiracy of American imperialism against the People's Republic of China.

    The commentary solemnly pointed out that Eisenhower's shameless defamation of the peaceful diplomatic policies of China and the Soviet Union was merely to deceive world opinion in order to cover up its own aggressive actions.

    The commentary refuted Eisenhower's argument that the American armed provocations in the Taiwan Strait were for the sake of "protecting" American interests. The commentary said that China's territory, Taiwan, and the neighboring islands have nothing to do with the United States, which is thousands of miles away.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 15th—According to TASS, Moscow: "Pravda" published an article on the 15th commenting on the American President Eisenhower's television speech on September 11th. The article pointed out that most American newspapers cannot ignore the deep dissatisfaction with this speech from all walks of life. Many newspapers said that Eisenhower was repeating Dulles's bellicose statements. The American President's speech did not answer the main question that the American people are concerned about: Does the American government intend to take practical steps to eliminate the dangerous source of war in the Far East? The article pointed out that not only the broad masses of the American people, but also many senators and other political activists, fiercely criticized Eisenhower's speech. The sharp criticism of American foreign policy within the United States thoroughly shattered the hypocritical lies of Washington propagandists that this policy is in line with the "security" interests of the American people. American newspapers and social and political figures pointed out that the provocative, arbitrary, and blackmailing policies pursued by Washington are contrary to the true interests of the United States.

    兄弟国家报纸同声痛斥艾森豪威尔的战争叫嚣
    美国侵略者在新中国门前自掘坟墓
    苏联“真理报”指出美国政策已在国内引起不满
    据新华社14日讯　波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和保加利亚的报纸，最近两天来纷纷发表评论，斥责艾森豪威尔就台湾海峡地区局势所发表的电视演说。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”13日在一篇文章中说，艾森豪威尔的广播演说只不过是企图歪曲事实和为长期加紧侵略中国制造借口。这篇演说承认，美国并不打算放弃毫不犹豫地反对世界各地民族解放运动的宪兵角色。
    这家报纸指出，抱有解放自己领土的正义决心的中国人民完全没有被美国的威胁和挑衅所吓倒。侵略者只能够在新中国的大门前为自己挖掘坟墓。“红色权利报”14日在评论艾森豪威尔企图用慕尼黑事件来为美国在台湾地区的侵略行为作辩解时，坚决斥责了他颠倒历史事实、歪曲捷克斯洛伐克民族悲剧的可耻行为。
    评论引证许多确凿的事实揭露了美国政府对希特勒侵略政策的援助和在慕尼黑事件中所起的帮凶作用。评论着重谈到身受惨重牺牲的捷克斯洛伐克人民有权向世界公众提出警告，慕尼黑事件证明了中国人民完全有权利不向美国侵略者作任何让步。
    波兰“人民论坛报”13日的评论写道，凡是抱有维护一切国家主权和维护和平的观点的人，都不能接受美国总统为美国部队在台湾地区的行动所提出的论据。这家报纸接着写道，艾森豪威尔把中华人民共和国解放自己领土台湾和沿海岛屿的愿望同法西斯国家在第二次世界大战前的政策相提并论，这是对中华人民共和国的侮辱。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”在一篇题为“艾森豪威尔的战争挑衅纲领”的评论中说，任何一个和平爱好者都不能够对艾森豪威尔的演说抱幻想。艾森豪威尔的演说有张牙舞爪地对中国的威胁，也有把美国的侵略政策说成是和平政策的企图。美国总统的这种努力造成了大堆的混乱言词、诬蔑和歪曲。
    14日的罗马尼亚“火花报”以“大炮后面的花言巧语”为题评论了艾森豪威尔的电视广播演说。评论指出，艾森豪威尔说他为了“保卫”美国的切身利益要被迫使用武力。这种野蛮的政策使人们想起了二十年前的希特勒和墨索里尼。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”的文章说，艾森豪威尔这篇演说纯粹是歪曲事实，是对中华人民共和国和苏联的无耻诬蔑和诽谤。但是，这丝毫也帮不了侵略者的忙。如果美帝国主义者胆敢武装侵略人民中国，他们必然要遭到毁灭性的打击。
    据新华社河内15日电　“人民报”15日发表评论说，艾森豪威尔给赫鲁晓夫的复信证明：美国当局仍然顽固地坚持同中国人民为敌的政策，完全违背了美国人民和全世界爱好和平人民要求美国立即停止在台湾海峡和远东地区的挑衅行为的愿望。
    评论指出，美国为了侵略的目的竟要求中国在台湾海峡地区“放弃使用武力”，也就是说要中国人民放弃自己的领土和主权。这种荒谬的论调只能说明美国顽固地坚持干涉他国内政，把中国人民的内部事务同美国在台湾海峡地区所引起的国际争端混在一起，这种伎俩是骗不了人的。
    评论指出，目前维护远东和平的唯一办法是美军立即撤出台湾海峡地区。如果美国继续倒行逆施，就只会加重自己的罪恶和自食其果。
    据新华社乌兰巴托14日电　蒙古“真理报”14日发表评论指出，艾森豪威尔11日发表的电视演说更加露骨地暴露了美帝国主义对中华人民共和国的战争挑衅阴谋。
    评论严正指出，艾森豪威尔无耻地诽谤中国和苏联的和平外交政策，只不过是要欺骗世界舆论，以便掩饰它自己的侵略行为。
    评论驳斥了艾森豪威尔把美国在台湾海峡的武装挑衅说成是为了“保护”美国利益的论调。评论说，中国的领土台湾和邻近岛屿同相距成千上万里的美国是毫不相干的。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”15日发表了一篇文章，评论美国总统艾森豪威尔9月11日的电视演说。文章指出，大多数美国报纸都不能无视各界人士对这篇演说的深深不满。许多报纸说，艾森豪威尔是在重复杜勒斯的好战声明。美国总统的演说并没有回答美国人民所关心的主要问题：美国政府到底是否打算采取实际步骤来消除远东的危险的战争策源地？文章指出，不只是美国的广大人民，就是许多参议员和其他政治活动家也都猛烈地抨击艾森豪威尔的演说。美国国内对美国外交政策的尖锐批评彻底地粉碎了华盛顿宣传家们所谓的这种政策是符合美国人民的“安全”利益的虚伪谰言。美国的报刊和社会及政界人士指出，华盛顿所奉行的挑衅、专横和讹诈政策同美国的真正利益是背道而驰的。
