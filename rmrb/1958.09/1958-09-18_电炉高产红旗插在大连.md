Electric Furnace High Yield Red Flag Planted in Dalian
Commentator of This Newspaper

    To produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year, the iron smelting front is in full swing, with thousands of troops fighting day and night. The production situation in some provinces has improved. What about the steelmaking front? We have said that the steelmaking problem is not too big. Judging from the steelmaking capacity of the 18 key enterprises, local steelmaking enterprises, and non-industrial sectors across the country, it is possible to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year. However, this does not mean that there are no problems in steelmaking. As of the beginning of September, although the average daily steel output nationwide increased by 8.8% compared to August, it is still far from the requirements of the national plan. This situation shows that the steel production situation is not good. We must take immediate action to quickly change the face of steelmaking production.
    In terms of steelmaking production, there are also some distinct red flags that are far ahead. Not long ago, we published the news about the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant's open hearth furnace utilization coefficient reaching 14.225. This is a red flag for open hearth furnace steelmaking. Today, we are publishing the news about the Dalian Steel Plant's average daily utilization coefficient of electric furnaces (the tons of steel produced per kilovolt-ampere of the electric furnace transformer per day and night) reaching 33.057. This is a red flag for electric furnace steelmaking. The Dalian Steel Plant's production indicators have been leading the country in the first half of this year. It also maintained the championship in the national average utilization coefficient of electric furnaces in July and August. In the first ten days of September, it broke records again, surpassing the indicators of July and August, with the average utilization coefficient soaring to 33.057. This shows that the production potential of electric furnace steelmaking is still very large. As long as we do our job well, we can make the original furnace produce more steel.
    Compared with the Dalian Steel Plant, many steel plants producing electric furnaces are lagging behind. Although there are a few factories with more advanced production indicators in electric furnace steelmaking. A steel plant in the southwest is good in terms of hot charging indicators. However, all steel plants producing electric furnaces have not yet caught up with the Dalian Steel Plant in the average utilization coefficient of electric furnace cold charging.
    The conditions in all aspects of the Dalian Steel Plant are not better than other electric furnace steel plants. On the contrary, the conditions of the Dalian Steel Plant are among the worst of the electric furnace steel plants. The one with poor conditions won the high-yield red flag. What does this show? Like the high-yield red flags of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, it once again shows that the human factor is the decisive factor for good or bad production. People with communist ideas and style are invincible and can overcome all obstacles. After the great rectification movement, the Dalian Steel Plant resolutely took the mass line, and the level of awareness of the workers greatly improved. On the basis of the rectification, it relied on all the workers, organized and gave play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all the workers. This is the main reason why they were able to win the high-yield red flag. Here we introduce two practices of the Dalian Steel Plant. These two practices are not only for electric furnace steel plants to learn from, but also for general steel plants to learn from.
    First, take the mass line. The mass line of the Dalian Steel Plant in organizing production mainly includes: First, organizing workers to participate in management. In the first quarter of this year, the steelmaking workshop handed over quota management and accounting work to the groups. Leading cadres engaged in experimental plots, the plant's scheduling meetings were changed to on-site meetings in the workshop, and cadres often discussed problems with workers, thus overcoming the tendency to be divorced from reality and the masses. Political life has become greatly active, and the enthusiasm has become greater and greater. The atmosphere of coming early and leaving late, and regarding the factory as home, has gradually formed. Second, learning from the experience of brother factories. The Dalian Steel Plant organizes workers to take turns to study at brother factories every month to absorb the experience of brother factories. There were also deviations in the learning process. Some people came to brother factories with complacency, not to learn, but to pick on others' faults. The factory criticized this tendency and corrected its learning attitude. Third, humbly learn from research departments and do a good job in external cooperation. The technical requirements for the production of electric furnace steel are relatively high, so it is very important to cooperate with research departments. The cooperative relationship between the factory and the Institute of Metals is relatively good.
    Second, technical revolution. On the basis of the rectification movement, the Dalian Steel Plant relied on the masses to break superstitions, create boldly, actively adopt new technologies, improve technical operations, and promote advanced experience, so the production records changed with each passing day. Due to a series of creations, the melting period was shortened from 120 minutes in the past to 60 to 70 minutes; the oxidation period was shortened from 60 minutes in the past to 15 to 20 minutes; and the reduction period was shortened from 90 minutes in the past to 40 to 50 minutes. The operating rate has also been greatly improved. In the past, it took 30 hours to replace a furnace wall, but now it only takes 30 minutes. Due to the strengthening of workers' sense of responsibility, the furnace roof is well maintained, and with the adoption of new technologies, the life of the furnace roof has been greatly extended. The highest number of uses reached 855 times, and the average in the first half of the year was 244 times. In the past, it was generally 30 to 80 times.
    Our conclusion is: When technology is mastered by the awakened masses, then any miracle can be created.
    If the Dalian Steel Plant can plant the high-yield red flag for electric furnaces, why can't other electric furnace steel plants plant the high-yield red flag high in their own factories? We are waiting for good news.

    电炉高产红旗插在大连
    本报评论员
    为年内生产一千零七十万吨钢，炼铁战线上轰轰烈烈，千军万马日夜奋战，有些省份，生产情况已有好转。炼钢战线又如何呢？我们说过，炼钢的问题不太大，从全国十八个重点企业和地方炼钢企业以及非工业部门的炼钢能力来看，年内生产一千零七十万吨钢是有可能的。但是，这并不等于说炼钢方面就没有问题了。从9月上旬来看，虽然全国钢的平均日产量比8月份增长了8.8％，同国家计划的要求仍有很大的距离。这个情况说明，钢的生产情况是并不好的。必须立即行动起来，迅速改变炼钢生产的面貌。
    在炼钢生产方面，也有一些鲜明的红旗，远远走在前面。不久以前，我们发表了上海第三钢铁厂平炉利用系数高达十四点二二五的新闻。这是平炉炼钢的一面红旗。今天又发表了大连钢厂电炉日平均利用系数（电炉的变压器每千伏安一昼夜产钢的吨数）达到三十三点零五七的新闻。这是电炉炼钢的一面红旗。大连钢厂的生产指标，今年上半年就一直在全国领先。7、8两个月也保持了全国电炉平均利用系数的冠军。在9月份的头十天，又连创纪录，突破了7、8两个月的指标，平均利用系数激增到三十三点零五七，这就说明了电炉炼钢的生产潜力还很大，只要我们把工作做好了，就可以叫原来的炉子生产出更多的钢来。
    同大连钢厂比较起来，许多电炉生产的钢厂都落在后面。虽然在电炉炼钢方面，生产指标比较先进的企业，还有几个厂。西南一个钢厂在热装的指标方面是好的。但是所有的电炉生产的钢厂在电炉冷装的平均利用系数上都还没有赶上大连钢厂。
    大连钢厂各方面的条件，并不比其他电炉钢厂好，恰恰相反，大连钢厂的条件在电炉钢厂中是比较差的一个。条件差的夺得了高产红旗，这说明什么问题呢？这和高炉、平炉的高产红旗一样，又一次说明了人的因素是生产好、坏的决定性的因素。具有共产主义思想和风格的人，是战无不胜、攻无不克的。大连钢厂经过伟大的整风运动，坚决地走群众路线，职工的觉悟程度大大的提高了。在整风的基础上，依靠全体职工、组织和发挥了全体职工的积极性和创造性。这是他们能够夺取高产红旗的主要原因。在这里我们介绍大连钢厂的两点做法，这两点做法不只是电炉钢厂可以学习的。而且是一般炼钢厂都可以学习的。
    第一、走群众路线。大连钢厂组织生产的群众路线主要是：一、组织工人参加管理。炼钢车间在今年第一季度就把定额管理和核算工作交到小组里去了。领导干部搞试验田，厂的调度会议改在车间开现场会议，干部经常和工人一起讨论问题，因而克服了脱离实际、脱离群众的倾向。政治生活大大活跃起来了，干劲也越来越大，经常早来晚走，以厂为家的风气逐渐形成。二、学习兄弟厂的经验。大连钢厂每个月都组织工人轮流到兄弟厂学习，吸取兄弟厂的经验。在学习中间也曾经有过偏差，有些人带着自满情绪，到兄弟厂不是学习，而是挑别人的毛病，该厂批判了这种倾向，端正了学习态度。三、虚心向研究部门学习，搞好外部协作。电炉钢的生产技术要求是比较高的，因此和研究部门协作很重要。该厂和金属研究所的合作关系就比较好。
    第二、技术革命。大连钢厂在整风运动的基础上依靠群众破除迷信，大胆创造，积极地采用新技术，改进技术操作，推广先进经验，因而生产纪录日新月异。由于一系列的创造，使熔化期由过去的一百二十分钟缩短到六十至七十分钟；氧化期由过去的六十分钟缩短到十五至二十分钟；还原期由过去的九十分钟缩短到四十至五十分钟。作业率也大大提高了，过去换一次炉壁要三十小时，现在只要三十分钟了。由于工人责任心加强，炉顶维护得好，加上新技术的采用，炉顶寿命大大延长了，最高一次曾达到八百五十五次。上半年平均在二百四十四次。过去一般都在三十至八十次。
    我们的结论是：技术被觉悟了的群众所掌握，那末什么奇迹都是可以创造出来的。
    大连钢厂能插电炉高产红旗，其他电炉钢厂为什么不能把高产红旗高高地插在自己的工厂呢？我们等待着好消息。
