Let High-Yield Red Flags Be Planted All Over the Country's Coal Mines
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    The Zaozhuang Coal Mine in Shandong has raised a red flag for high coal production (see the front page of today's newspaper for the news). The red flag records the following facts: the initial plan for the year was 1.5 million tons, now it has leaped to 2.77 million tons, and it is striving to reach 3 million tons. On September 20, the daily output was 14,618 tons, more than double the average daily output in August and ten times the daily output in January. We cannot help but cheer for the brilliant achievements of the workers of the Zaozhuang Coal Mine!
    Zaozhuang is a coking coal mine. "Before the troops move, the supplies must go first." Coking coal is an indispensable "supply" to ensure the ascension of the Iron and Steel Marshal. If all coal mines across the country could plant high-yield red flags like the Zaozhuang Coal Mine and increase the current average daily output by 50%, then the country could produce an additional 170,000 tons of coking coal per day, that is, more than enough "supplies" to smelt 43,000 tons of steel. What a significant economic event this is!
    Why is the Zaozhuang Coal Mine able to achieve such great success? Their valuable experience is that leaders must use revolutionary methods to direct production and lead production, that is, to lead the masses among the masses and to lead production in production. To lead production with a mass movement, and to promote the overall leap forward in work.
    Launching mass movements is an important experience gained by our Party in leading the revolution. However, in some coal mines, some comrades mistakenly regard launching mass movements as blind rushes, and therefore, they have come to the conclusion that "mass movements cannot be carried out in coal mining enterprises, otherwise they will be chaotic." We believe that mass movements and blind rushes are two completely different styles of work. The revolutionary movement of the masses is a conscious movement of the masses. The unfolding of this movement is achieved by the leaders and the masses working together as one, for a common goal, and implementing the mass line. Launching mass movements can enable us to constantly discover new problems, propose new tasks, and lead the masses to continue to move forward in actual work with the spirit of continuous revolution, giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Blind rushes are another matter. Those who advocate blind rushes often only care about the immediate future and ignore the consequences. They grasp the east and lose the west, paying attention to one thing and losing sight of another. Without necessary arrangements, they only aim for temporary high production, disrupting the necessary order, and bringing difficulties to future production. In particular, they fail to utilize the wisdom of the masses, and only a few people are tense. Therefore, blind rushes can never be regarded as a normal working method for our leadership of enterprises.
    Will launching mass movements disrupt the order of work? Our answer is: no. Since mass movements are conscious movements of the masses, the result of the movement is not to abandon the normal order of work, but to replace the old order with a new revolutionary order. In launching mass movements, all old orders that bind the development of productive forces will be ruthlessly destroyed, and all new revolutionary orders will emerge accordingly. Of course, in the process of "destroying" and "establishing," there may sometimes be some temporary disconnections and chaotic phenomena in the work, but as long as we pay attention, it can be avoided and overcome. Of course, special attention should be paid to safe production in the movement.
    The specific facts of the Zaozhuang Coal Mine tell us that if coal mining enterprises are to achieve large-scale bumper harvests, the leading comrades of the enterprises must first launch mass movements in a revolutionary spirit. High-yield command headquarters were established in the Mining Bureau and the mine, with the party secretary and the bureau and mine directors personally taking charge. All-out efforts were made to organize "multi-cycle operations," and a revolutionary working method of "one dragon" was adopted. From the ground to the underground working locations, powerful cadres were sent to direct production in all links of ground transportation, hoisting, underground transportation, coal mining, and tunneling, and to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Among the broad masses of workers and staff, it is necessary to repeatedly conduct propaganda and education with steel as the key and ensuring the ascension of the marshal, and to promote the mass production movement to a climax wave after wave in a step-by-step manner.
    The fact that the high-yield red flag is planted in the Zaozhuang Coal Mine directly raises a sharp question: Since the Zaozhuang Coal Mine can increase its daily output by more than double, why can't coal mines with similar or even better conditions than the Zaozhuang Coal Mine do the same? Why has the daily output of some coal mines decreased instead? It all depends on human effort, and human will can conquer nature. As long as we earnestly learn from the experience of the Zaozhuang Coal Mine in launching mass movements, output can be rapidly increased.
    Now, the battle on the iron and steel front has entered the most intense stage. Coal miners across the country should go all out, produce more coking coal, produce coking coal faster, and let high-yield red flags be planted all over the country's coal mines!

    让高产红旗插遍全国煤矿
    本报评论员
    山东枣庄煤矿升起了一面煤炭高产的红旗（消息见本报今日第一版）。红旗上记载着这样的事实：年初的计划是一百五十万吨，现在跃进到二百七十七万吨，并且争取达到三百万吨。9月20日，日产一万四千六百一十八吨，比8月份的平均日产量提高了一倍多，比1月份的日产量提高了十倍。我们看了枣庄煤矿职工的辉煌成就，不禁要为它热烈欢呼！
    枣庄是生产炼焦煤的矿井，“兵马未动，粮草先行”，炼焦煤是保证钢铁元帅升帐必不可少的“粮草”。如果全国煤矿都像枣庄煤矿那样插上高产的红旗，能将现在的平均日产量提高50％，那么，全国每天就可以多出焦煤十七万吨，也就是说，可以多供给冶炼四万三千吨钢铁所需要的“粮草”。这是一件具有多么重大经济意义的事件啊！
    枣庄煤矿为什么能争取这么大的成就呢？他们的宝贵经验是：领导者必须以革命的办法去指挥生产、领导生产，也就是说，要到群众中领导群众，到生产中领导生产。以大搞群众运动的方法去领导生产，推动工作的全面大跃进。
    大搞群众运动是我们党领导革命的一条重要经验。但是，在某些煤矿中，有的同志把大搞群众运动误认为盲目突击，因此，得出了这样的结论：“煤矿企业是不能大搞群众运动的，否则就会搞乱了”。我们认为群众运动和盲目突击是截然不同的两种作风。群众的革命运动，是群众的自觉运动，这个运动的展开，是领导与群众打成一片，为着一个目标，贯彻群众路线而实现的。大搞群众运动，就能在实际工作中以不断革命的精神，发挥群众的积极性和创造性不断发现新的问题，提出新的任务，领导群众继续前进。而盲目突击则是另一回事，主张盲目突击的人常常只顾眼前不顾后果，他们抓东丢西，顾此失彼，没有必要的安排，只为一时的多产，破坏了必需遵守的秩序，给以后的生产带来困难。特别是没有发挥群众的智慧，只是少数人紧张。因此，盲目突击，决不能作为我们领导企业的一个正常的工作方法。
    大搞群众运动是不是会把工作秩序搞乱了呢？我们的答复是：不会的。群众运动既然是群众的自觉运动，那末，运动的结果并不是不要正常的工作秩序，而是要以新的革命的秩序去代替旧的秩序。在大搞群众运动中，一切束缚生产力发展的旧秩序，将得到无情的毁击，一切新的革命的秩序随着就产生出来。当然在“破”和“立”的过程中，有时也会发生一些工作暂时脱节和忙乱的现象，但只要我们加以注意，是可以避免和克服的。当然，在运动中应当特别注意安全生产。
    枣庄煤矿的具体事实告诉我们：煤矿企业要获得大面积丰产，企业的领导同志首先要以革命的精神大搞群众运动。在矿务局和矿成立了高产指挥部，由党委书记和局、矿长亲自挂帅。全力组织“多循环作业”，采取了“一条龙”的革命的工作方法，从井上到井下的工作地点，对地面运输、提升、井下运输和采煤、掘进各个环节派出强有力的干部去指挥生产，及时发现问题，解决问题。在广大职工群众中，要反复地进行以钢为纲，保证元帅上升的宣传教育，有步骤地促使群众生产运动一浪高一浪地推向高潮。
    高产的红旗插在枣庄煤矿的事实，直接提出了一个尖锐的问题：既然枣庄煤矿能够把日产量提高一倍以上，为什么与枣庄煤矿条件相类似的甚至条件更加优越的煤矿不能做到呢？为什么有些煤矿的日产量反而降低了呢？事在人为，人定胜天，只要认真学习枣庄煤矿大搞群众运动的经验，产量就能迅速提高。
    现在，钢铁战线的斗争，已进入最激烈的阶段，全国煤矿职工应该鼓足干劲，多出焦煤，快出焦煤，让高产红旗插遍全国煤矿！
