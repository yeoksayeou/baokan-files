The responsible cadres of the Beijing Chaoyang Electric Motor Factory and the Northern Suburbs Livestock Farm, due to the development of localism, committed serious errors of disorganization and lack of discipline in their economic work, and were punished by Party discipline. All economic workers should draw profound lessons from the mistakes made by these two units.

Some units, represented by the Chaoyang Electric Motor Factory, developed a practice of "bartering goods": turning products into means of exchange, and treating scarce materials and equipment as rare commodities, hoarding them for speculation, so that anyone who wanted them had to exchange them for what they needed. They even exchanged A for B, and then B for C, turning themselves into speculative merchants. This "bartering" practice, to some extent, created a situation where major channels were blocked and minor channels were clear, making it impossible to realize the national plan. At the same time, because some urgently needed materials and equipment for production and construction were shuffled around, becoming means of exchange and storage, they could not be used for production and construction. Some units also exaggerated their needs, claiming to have little when they had plenty, creating artificial tension, increasing the difficulty of material supply, and scattering the materials most urgently needed for national production and construction, making it impossible to ensure key projects and focus on the most important aspects. Therefore, this practice is not only an act of sabotaging the national plan, but also an act of sabotaging national construction and the Great Leap Forward. We must persist in the struggle against this erroneous tendency in order to guarantee the implementation of the Party's general line.

It should be said that the shortage of materials and equipment is indeed a difficulty, but the question is how to correctly deal with this difficulty. Now, many units are vigorously engaged in iron and steel smelting, self-manufacturing cement, and self-manufacturing equipment, using simple indigenous equipment to replace foreign equipment that is temporarily lacking; the broad masses of workers are vigorously engaged in technological revolution, improving equipment utilization efficiency, and saving raw materials as much as possible, and making extensive use of substitutes; the people of the city are supporting the Great Leap Forward in industry, and many economic units are extensively clearing warehouses. This is the fundamental direction for overcoming current difficulties. Of course, even if some units have done this, their needed materials and equipment may still not be resolved temporarily. This cannot be solved by bartering either, but must rely on the state's overall planning. Moreover, the more strained the material supply, the more necessary it is to strengthen planning, strengthen unified management and unified arrangements, to ensure key projects while taking into account general needs, to ensure backbone projects while taking into account branches and leaves. We cannot allow whoever produces something to own it, or whoever has something to freely dispose of it. Doing so may make it impossible for some units to solve the difficulties in materials and equipment, causing these units to suffer some temporary losses, but this is beneficial to the overall situation. Because, since the difficulties of certain materials and equipment cannot be completely solved temporarily, we can only achieve great things by refraining from doing some things. Here, the relationship between small interests and large interests, small picture and big picture, is very clear. For units whose material and equipment difficulties cannot be solved indeed, they can also change products, change plans, or even suspend work and reduce production with approval. Under no circumstances should we lose sight of the big picture for the sake of small gains.

Some people say that bartering is also a kind of initiative, one of the ways to try every possible means, and opposing bartering is打击 (dǎjī, to crack down on, attack) people's initiative. Here, a question is raised: What kind of initiative do we advocate? Is it the initiative of localism, or the initiative of communism? Is it an initiative that conforms to the national plan, or a blind, anarchic initiative? Is it an initiative that proceeds from the overall situation, or an initiative that disregards the overall situation and only cares about the small picture? Obviously, in our socialist country, people have all the convenient conditions to give full play to their initiative; however, this initiative can only be highly developed when it is combined with the national plan and with centralized and unified leadership. We must always pay attention to fully developing this initiative. As for the localist, anarchic initiative, that is an evil trend that must be resolutely stopped.

Some people say that bartering is also "mutual support" and "mutual collaboration." This statement is simply absurd, completely distorting the spirit of communist cooperation, and concealing the localism of benefiting oneself at the expense of others. The communist cooperation we advocate is: for the sake of the overall situation, in order to ensure the key points of national construction, we unconditionally support brother factories and mines, and even temporarily sacrifice the interests of our own units. The so-called "mutual support" mentioned above is to haggle over every detail, to bargain, if you don't give me something, I will never "support" you, and even if an agreement is signed, it can be violated, truly exhausting the means of capitalist speculators. As for the national plan, it has long been shelved, and they don't care if others can't complete the national task, and they don't actively complete the task assigned to them by the state. This kind of "mutual collaboration" is simply tearing each other down, and tearing down the socialist stage.

The mistakes of the Chaoyang Electric Motor Factory and the Northern Suburbs Livestock Farm are serious localism, and have developed into serious acts of disorganization and lack of discipline. Therefore, in order to safeguard the national plan and the seriousness of Party discipline, it is entirely necessary and correct to give appropriate punishment to these comrades who have seriously violated discipline.

Some people ask: Why did these comrades still commit such serious errors of disorganized and undisciplined localism after the great rectification campaign? There is no doubt that after the rectification campaign, the awareness of the broad masses of cadres and people has been greatly improved, the communist spirit, the spirit of collaboration, the spirit of "I am for everyone, and everyone is for me" has been greatly promoted, and localism, individualism, and the "three winds and five airs" have been greatly overcome. This is the main aspect, the mainstream of things. But it must also be seen that in some places, the rectification campaign is not very thorough, the ideological revolution has not been carried out thoroughly, there has been no thorough "smashing and establishing," and especially localism has not been thoroughly discredited like individualism. Some people always think that localism is not for personal gain, that a little localism is not a big deal, and even say that localism is also doing socialism. They have not seen that localism is essentially a manifestation of individualism, and they have not seen that in some cases, the destructiveness of localism to socialist construction is even more serious than that of individualism. In these places, there is still the task of continuing to deepen the rectification campaign. At the same time, the transition period runs through the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the historical task of promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie cannot be solved by one rectification campaign. As long as political and ideological leadership is slightly relaxed, bourgeois ideology will take the opportunity to enter. Therefore, we must once again emphasize that in economic work, we must not leave political command at any time, and we must not leave the spirit of communism at any time. At any time, we must regard the completion of the national plan as the primary task, and at any time, we must consciously abide by economic discipline; bartering must be stopped; all important materials and equipment must be managed centrally by the state; contracts signed according to the national plan must be fulfilled, state allocation orders must be obeyed, and decisions of the higher authorities must be implemented. This is the basic lesson we should learn from the mistakes of the Chaoyang Electric Motor Factory and the Northern Suburbs Livestock Farm.

    彻底搞臭本位主义
    ——北京日报九月二十八日社论摘要
    北京市朝阳电机厂和北郊畜牧场的负责干部，由于本位主义的发展，在经济工作中犯了严重的无组织、无纪律的错误，受到了党纪的处分。全体经济工作人员应当从这两个单位所犯的错误中，吸取深刻的教训。
    以朝阳电机厂为代表的一些单位，发展了一种“以货易货”的作法：把产品变成交换手段，把供应不足的材料、设备视为奇货，囤积居奇，谁要谁就得拿他们所需要的东西来交换。他们甚至以甲物换乙物，又以乙物换丙物，倒来倒去，把自己变成投机倒把的商人。这种“以货易货”的作法，在某种程度上造成大道阻塞、小道畅通的局面，使国家计划不能实现。同时，由于一些生产建设上急需的材料、设备倒来倒去，变成交换手段、储存手段，不能用在生产建设上，有些单位又以多叫少，以有叫无，制造人为的紧张，增加物资供应的困难，使国家生产建设最迫切需要的物资分散使用，不能用来确保重点，不能用在最主要的方面。因此，这种作法不但是破坏国家计划的行为，而且是破坏国家建设、破坏大跃进的行为。必须坚持同这种错误倾向作斗争，才能保证党的总路线的贯彻执行。
    应当说，材料、设备不足确实是个困难，但是，问题是如何正确对待这种困难。现在，许多单位大搞炼铁、炼钢，自造水泥，自造设备，用简易的土设备来代替一时缺少的洋设备；广大职工大搞技术革命，提高设备利用效率，尽量节约原材料，尽量利用代用品；全市人民支援工业大跃进，许多经济单位大量清理仓库。这是当前克服困难的根本方向。当然，有些单位虽然这样做了，但是他们所需要的材料和设备暂时仍旧有可能解决不了。这也不能依靠以货易货来解决，而必须依靠国家的统筹安排。而且，越是物资供应紧张，就越需要加强计划，加强统一管理和统一安排，确保重点、兼顾一般，确保骨干、兼顾枝叶。不能谁生产了就归谁，谁有就由谁自由支配。这样做，可能会使有一些单位在材料、设备上的困难解决不了，使这些单位遭受一些暂时的损失，但是，这对全局却是有利的。因为，既然某些材料、设备的困难暂时不能全部解决，就只能有所不为才能大有所为。在这里，小利益和大利益、小局和大局的关系是很明显的。对于某些材料、设备困难确实解决不了的单位，也可以经过批准，改变产品，改变计划，甚至停工减产，绝不可以因小失大。
    有人说，以货易货也是一种积极性，也是千方百计之一计，反对以货易货就是打击人们的积极性。这里提出了一个问题：究竟我们提倡什么样的积极性。是本位主义的积极性，还是共产主义的积极性？是合乎国家计划的积极性，还是盲目的、无政府的积极性？是从全局出发的积极性，还是不顾大局、只顾小局的积极性？很明显，在我们社会主义国家里，人们有充分发挥积极性的一切便利条件；但是，这种积极性只有同国家计划、同集中统一的领导结合起来，才能得到高度的发挥。我们必须时刻注意充分发扬这种积极性。至于本位主义的、无政府的积极性，那是一股歪风，必须坚决制止。
    有人说，以货换货也是“互相支援”“互相协作”。这种说法，简直是奇谈怪论，完全歪曲共产主义的协作精神，掩盖损人利己的本位主义。我们提倡的共产主义协作是：为了大局，为了保证国家建设的重点，就无条件地支援兄弟厂矿，甚至可以暂时牺牲一些本单位的利益。而上面所说的所谓“互相支援”，是斤斤计较，讨价还价，你不给我东西，我决不“支援”你，甚至订了协议也可以不遵守，真是使尽了资本主义投机商人的手段。至于国家计划，早已束之高阁，别人完不成国家任务也不管，国家给自己的任务也不积极完成。这种“互相协作”，简直是互相拆台，而且是拆社会主义的大台。
    朝阳电机厂和北郊畜牧场的错误是严重的本位主义，并且已经发展成为严重的无组织、无纪律的行为。因此，为了维护国家计划和党的纪律的严肃性，对这些严重违反纪律的同志给予适当的处分，是完全必要的，正确的。
    有人提出：为什么经过伟大的整风，这些同志还会犯这样严重的无组织、无纪律的本位主义的错误？毫无疑问，经过整风，广大干部和群众的觉悟大大提高了，共产主义之风，协作之风，我为人人、人人为我之风大大发扬了，本位主义、个人主义、三风五气大大克服了，这是主要的方面，是事物的主流。但是也要看到，在一些地方，整风还不很彻底，没有彻底进行思想革命，没有彻底大破大立，特别是本位主义还没有像个人主义一样彻底搞臭。有些人总认为本位主义不是为了个人，有点本位主义不算什么，甚至说本位主义搞的也是社会主义。他们没有看到，本位主义实质上是个人主义的一种表现，没有看到在某些情况下，本位主义对社会主义建设的破坏性甚至比个人主义还要严重。在这些地方，还有继续深入整风的任务。同时，过渡时期是贯穿着无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争的，兴无灭资的历史任务，绝不是一次整风就能解决的。任何地方只要稍一放松政治思想领导，资产阶级思想就要乘隙而入。因此，我们必须再一次强调，在经济工作中，一时一刻也不能离开政治挂帅，一时一刻也不能离开共产主义的精神。任何时候都要把完成国家计划当作首要的任务，任何时候都要自觉地遵守经济纪律；以货易货必须停止；一切重要材料、设备必须由国家集中管理；按国家计划签订的合同必须履行，国家调拨命令必须服从，上级决定必须执行。这就是我们应该从朝阳电机厂、北郊畜牧场的错误中吸取的基本教训。
