Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 5th. Romesh Chandra, a member of the National Council of the Indian Communist Party, published an article in the latest issue of the "New Century" weekly, condemning U.S. imperialism for creating tension in the Far East.

Chandra pointed out that it is by no means accidental that the U.S. government is creating tension in the Taiwan area and Chinese territorial waters at such a time. This is an integral part of the U.S. policy of igniting the flames of war in one part or another of the world.

Chandra quoted Chairman Mao Zedong's words at the time of the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution in 1949: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until their extinction—that is the logic of the imperialists and all reactionaries in the world." Chandra said that this logic of imperialism is linked to Dulles, the expert in brinkmanship. Chandra believes that another reason for the new aggressive actions taken by the United States in the Far East is related to the upcoming session of the United Nations General Assembly, because at this session more countries will support the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

Chandra said, "The Indian people today, as in the past, guarantee friendship with China, oppose imperialism, and strengthen Asian-African solidarity and world peace." He added that the Indian people unanimously demand that U.S. imperialists not take adventurous actions against China and that U.S. troops withdraw from Taiwan. He pointed out that the most powerful force is the force for world peace, not the U.S. troops gathered along the Chinese coast.

Chandra called on people not to listen to all the lies spread by imperialist propaganda organs regarding the situation in Taiwan, to maintain a clear view, so that it is possible to take action to defeat the imperialist conspiracy and win the victory of peace.

　　这就是杜勒斯所走的道路
    印共全国委员会委员钱德拉斥美国挑衅者
    新华社新德里5日电　印度共产党全国委员会委员罗米希·钱德拉在最近一期的“新世纪”周刊上发表文章，谴责美帝国主义在远东制造紧张局势。
    钱德拉指出，美国政府在这样一个时候在台湾地区和中国领海制造紧张局势决不是偶然的。这是美国在世界的这一部分或那一部分点起战火的政策的组成部分。
    钱德拉引述毛泽东主席在1949年中国人民革命胜利的时候说过的话：捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直到灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派的逻辑。钱德拉说，帝国主义的这种逻辑是同战争边缘政策专家杜勒斯联系在一起的。钱德拉认为，美国在远东采取新的侵略行动的另一个原因是同即将召开的联合国大会会议有关，因为在这次会议上将会有更多的国家支持恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位。
    钱德拉说，“印度人民今天像过去一样，保证同中国友好，反对帝国主义，并且加强亚非团结和世界和平”。他又说，印度人民一致要求美帝国主义者不要对中国采取冒险行动，把美军从台湾撤出去。他指出，最强大的力量是世界和平力量，而不是集结在中国沿海一带的美国军队。
    钱德拉要求人们不要听信帝国主义宣传机关就台湾局势所散播的一切谎言，保持清醒的看法，以便有可能采取行动，击败帝国主义的阴谋，争取和平的胜利。
