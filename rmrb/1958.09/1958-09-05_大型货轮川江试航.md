　　Large Freighter Trial Voyage on the Sichuan River

　　The idea of large freighters sailing on the Sichuan River was something people wouldn't even dare to imagine before. On August 31st, the "People No. 9," a large freighter of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration with a deadweight of 3,778 tons, conquered the natural barriers of the Sichuan River and arrived safely in Chongqing, creating a miracle in the history of Sichuan River shipping. The successful trial voyage of large freighters on the Sichuan River is of great significance to the development of the Sichuan River shipping industry.
