How to Continue Teaching Well
——Notes from a Symposium of Old Professors at Beijing Railway Institute on the Party's Educational Policy
By Our Correspondent Bai Sheng

After Comrade Lu Dingyi's article on the integration of education with productive labor was published, what views did the old professors have on the Party's educational policy? At a symposium at Beijing Railway Institute, many veteran teachers discussed their understanding of the Party's educational policy in connection with the recent movement to criticize bourgeois educational and academic thought within the school.

Professor Shen ZouTing, the head of the Transportation Department, who was recently criticized by students in big-character posters as an "Imperial Envoy," said with great emotion that for more than twenty years, he had always thought that his teaching was correct. However, this time, when he went to the railway site with the graduating class, the situation of teaching being divorced from reality was seriously exposed. He said that he thought going to the site was very simple and that he could not learn anything from the workers. He was afraid of contacting workers and students because they would raise many questions on site that he could not solve, which would make him lose face. Therefore, what interested him on the site was only "things"—machinery, equipment, and materials—and he did not pay attention to "people." He said that this was exactly like his bourgeois educational thinking of teaching books but not teaching people. Even now, he could not name many students. This time when he went to the site, he saw that the theories he taught in the classroom, which sounded logical, were of no use to the students at all. On the site, many students were not clear about various operations and learned from the veteran workers on the spot. He said that in the past, he did not go to the site, so he could not realize the seriousness of teaching being divorced from reality. Now that the students have returned from the site, they have enriched themselves in productive labor. If we bourgeois professors still teach according to the old methods, it will be a joke.

Speaking of this, the old professor, who had taught railway transportation for more than twenty years and had memorized all the books, keenly felt that if his bourgeois educational thinking, which was divorced from productive labor, was not transformed, he would not be able to meet the requirements of the students.

Wan Xicheng, a gray-haired old professor in the Telecommunications Department, talked about his many feelings about the current educational revolution in the school.

This old professor, who could be considered to have some book knowledge in a bourgeois university, saw with his own eyes the tremendous changes that have taken place in this old school with a history of more than forty years after the implementation of the policy of integrating education with productive labor. Facing the factories set up by the students from scratch, the Hongguo (Hawthorn) Garden farm, which was cultivated by the teachers, students, and staff of the whole school and is about to have a bumper harvest, and the batches of young students who have returned from labor on the vast railway site, how could this old professor not be filled with emotion when he recalled his own situation when he was studying at the university? Now the classroom, the factory, and the railway network of the motherland are connected as one. The old professor said that this educational revolution, as Comrade Lu Dingyi said, is a revolution against thousands of years of old traditions in education. He said that for more than two thousand years, education has been divorced from productive labor. He has always been trapped in the framework of those traditional old educations. In this educational revolution, if he does not eliminate and criticize those decadent bourgeois educational thoughts, he will not be able to keep up. He is determined to put down his airs, take workers as his teachers, and go to productive labor to be a primary school student to enrich and transform himself.

Jin Shixuan, an old professor who worked in railway transportation command at the Xizhimen Railway Station in Beijing twenty-five years ago, recently requested the school to allow him to return to the railway site and take veteran workers as his teachers. He is also one of the professors who was criticized by students as an "Imperial Envoy." At the symposium, he talked with deep feeling about his long-term satisfaction with book knowledge, thinking that the more book knowledge one had, the more knowledgeable one would be. In fact, this knowledge is divorced from practical production. He said that he recently returned from the railway site with the students, but the students gained a lot, not the professors. He said that on the site, university professors like them could not do big things or handle small things well. And the students? They took workers as their teachers, studied with the workers, and helped solve the line problems on the site. In productive labor, the students' thoughts and feelings also changed. He said that from the students' harvest of labor on the site, he realized the importance of integrating education with productive labor, and teachers must also go to the site to participate in productive labor and learn from the workers.

Xu Junyuan, an associate professor in the Transportation Department, said that after reading Comrade Lu Dingyi's article on the Party's educational policy, he felt that in the Great Leap Forward, the most backward were bourgeois intellectuals like him. If anyone still participates in the ranks of socialist construction with a set of old educational ideas, it is actually a kind of harm.

Many professors deeply felt that they were too empty and too backward when they compared themselves to the current situation of the Great Leap Forward. Up to now, they are only satisfied with their own university professor's signboard and are unwilling to put down their airs. One professor said that the publication of Comrade Lu Dingyi's article on educational policy is another alarm bell for the old professors. We must resolutely take the road of integrating education with productive labor and go deep into the site. If anyone hesitates again, it is self-inflicted backwardness.

    怎样把书教下去
    ——记北京铁道学院老教授座谈党的教育方针
    本报记者　柏生
    陆定一同志关于教育必须与生产劳动相结合的文章发表以后，老教授们对于党的教育方针有些什么看法呢？在北京铁道学院的一个座谈会上，许多老教师结合校内最近开展的批判资产阶级教育思想和学术思想运动，谈述了他们对党的教育方针的一些体会。
    最近被同学们用大字报批评为“钦差大臣”的运输系系主任沈奏廷老教授，十分感慨地说，二十多年来，他一直以为自己的教学是正确的，可是，这次和毕业班学生一起下铁路现场，就严重地暴露出教学脱离实际的状况。他说，他以为下现场很简单，从工人那里学不到什么东西。他怕多接触工人和学生，因为他们在现场上会提出许多问题，自己不能解决就会丢脸。因此，他对下现场感兴趣的只是“物”——机器设备和资料，对“人”并不重视。他说，这正像他教书不教人的资产阶级教育思想一样，直到现在，有许多学生的名字还叫不上来。这次下现场，他看到自己在课堂上教的那一套讲起来头头是道的理论，学生根本用不上。在现场上，许多学生对各种操作都不大明了，而是现向老工人学习。他说，他过去不下现场，根本体会不到教学脱离实际的严重性。如今学生已经从现场上回来了，他们在生产劳动中已经充实了自己，我们这些资产阶级教授们如果还按老方法教学，那就会闹笑话了。
    讲到这里，这位教了二十多年铁路运输、把书都背熟了的老教授，痛切地感到自己的脱离生产劳动的资产阶级教育思想再不改造就不能适应学生的要求。
    白发苍苍的电信系老教授汪禧成谈起他对当前学校教育大革命的许多感想。
    这位在资产阶级大学算得上有些书本学问的老教授，亲眼看到，这座有四十多年历史的老学校，在贯彻教育结合生产劳动的方针以后，所起的巨大变化。面对着学校里学生白手起家办起来的一座座工厂，全校师生员工亲手开辟起来的就要丰收的红果园农场，以及一批批从广阔的铁路现场劳动归来的年轻学生，再回忆起他自己当年在大学读书时的情况，怎能不引起这位老教授的感慨呢！如今课堂、工厂和祖国的铁路网都已连成一片。这位老教授说，这场教育大革命，正像陆定一同志所说，是教育工作中反对几千年的旧传统的一个革命。他说，两千多年来，教育一直是脱离生产劳动的，他就是一直套在那些传统的旧教育的框框里，在这次教育革命中，自己再不清除和批判那些腐朽的资产阶级教育思想，就跟不上去了。他决心放下架子，拜工人为师，到生产劳动中去做个小学生，充实和改造自己。
    二十五年前就在北京西直门车站做铁路运输指挥工作的金士宣老教授，最近请求学校准许他回到铁路现场去，拜老工人为师。他也是被同学们批评为“钦差大臣”的教授之一。在座谈会上，他深有所感地谈起自己长期只满足于书本知识，以为只有书本知识愈多才愈有学问。实际上，这些知识都是脱离生产实际的东西。他说，他最近和学生一起下铁路现场回来，可是收获巨大的是学生，而不是教授。他说，在现场上我们这些大学教授是大事做不了，小事办不好。而学生呢？他们拜工人为师，同工人一起研究，帮助解决现场上的线路问题。在生产劳动中，学生们的思想感情也起了变化。他说，从学生下现场劳动的丰收中，他体会到教育结合生产劳动的重要性，教师也必须下现场参加生产劳动，向工人学习。
    运输系副教授许君远说，他看了陆定一同志关于党的教育方针的文章以后，感到在大跃进中，最落后的就是像他这样的资产阶级知识分子。如果谁再拿一套旧的教育思想参加到社会主义建设的行列里来，那实际上就是一种危害了。
    许多教授在座谈中对比了今天万马奔腾的大跃进形势，都深深地感到自己实在太空虚太落后了。他们到现在还只是满足于自己的那一块大学教授的招牌，不肯放下架子。有位教授说，陆定一同志关于教育方针文章的发表，对老教授们是再一次敲起了警钟。必须坚决地走教育结合生产劳动的道路，深入现场，如果谁再迟疑，那就是自甘掉队了。
