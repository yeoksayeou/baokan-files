    U.S. Imperialism is a "Paper Tiger"
    By Kair, Secretary-General of the Sudanese World Peace Council
    As you celebrate the new achievements of your Great Leap Forward every day, we, from afar, raise our hands across the Indian Ocean to salute your extraordinary efforts in building socialism and advancing victoriously.
    Since the Bandung Conference and the Cairo Conference, the ever-increasing solidarity between the people of Africa and Asia, especially with the Chinese people, has been increasingly consolidated in the common struggle against world imperialism headed by the United States, for national independence and world peace.
    The war drums of the new Africa have resounded in every corner of this vast continent. The myth of "European masters and civilizers" has been shattered in the brilliant light of truth shining on the whole of Africa. The masks that imperialists have used for centuries to conceal their blood-sucking faces have also been torn off, and the American, British, and French imperialists and their servants have been nakedly exposed before all Africans.
    Our banner of struggle for freedom and peace is being raised continuously in Algeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Togo, South Africa, and all other colonial and independent countries of Africa. This struggle is not only supported by 210 million Africans, but also by more than two-thirds of the world's people.
    The recent U.S. aggressive actions against the People’s Republic of China in the Taiwan area have given the African people more concrete evidence to recognize the essence of the U.S.’s hateful policies; and filled their hearts with greater energy and determination to block the U.S. from infiltrating the African continent.
    I am very fortunate to be able to see and personally feel the preparations and amazing enthusiasm of the three million demonstrators in Beijing in support of Premier Zhou Enlai's six-point statement. This preparation has given the U.S. imperialists a decisive blow in interfering in China's internal affairs and clearly demonstrates the high degree of awareness of the Chinese people, their unshakable unity, and their support for their beloved leaders headed by Chairman Mao Zedong.
    Although our own experience is limited, we have learned many times from practice that U.S. imperialists will always become weak in the face of the people's firm will and active resistance. And all the disturbances they create are just the howls of cowards to embolden themselves. In March 1957, when U.S. Vice President Nixon visited some African countries to promote the Eisenhower Doctrine and seek new ways to expand U.S. influence in independent African countries, our country (Sudan) was one of his targets. On the day Nixon arrived in Sudan, every street was covered with slogans against his government's policies—"Nixon, go back to your country," "Down with the Eisenhower Doctrine," etc. All mass organizations issued statements exposing the true intentions of Nixon's visit and prepared a large-scale demonstration especially to welcome him. The airport and its adjacent streets were all occupied by troops equipped with machine guns. Shops and markets in many towns held strikes to protest. In such an atmosphere, the U.S. visitor could no longer openly declare that he was there to get us to accept the Eisenhower Doctrine. On March 14, 1957, at a press conference, he talked about the importance of neutrality to Sudan. And when he was angered at the press conference, he said: "Let those in Sudan who are so eager for freedom and liberation go to Hungary to fight for them."
    This experience and the resistance of mass organizations and political parties throughout the country to the U.S. "aid" agreement (March 1958)—despite the fact that it had been passed in the House of Representatives by a narrow majority of four votes (101 votes in favor, 97 votes against)—gave us another proof that in the face of a united people, U.S. imperialism is nothing but a "paper tiger"!
    We are fully aware of the U.S. plan for Africa and have seen the activities of its embassies, legations, consulates, delegations, and associations, which use these units to sow discord among the people, promote and propagate the American way of life, bribe everywhere, and spread corruption and depravity.
    In those newly independent African countries, the United States is expanding its influence. Its activities have expanded everywhere, with the sole intention of turning these countries into wheels of the U.S. war machine and strategic deployment. Every concession and retreat made by British and French imperialists under the pressure of patriotic forces is exploited by U.S. imperialists to serve their own fundamental purposes. In short, they are trying to replace the positions of Britain and France. This is a new picture of the United States in Africa today.
    We Africans are convinced that the peace forces of the world, especially the people of the Soviet Union and China, will be pleased to see the rise of the African people's movement for national independence and liberation. The 140 million Africans who are still under the yoke of imperialism will vow to fight relentlessly until they become masters of their own destiny. It is the permanent and just obligation of all peace-loving people to give us all possible help and encouragement in our struggle to completely destroy all colonial systems in Africa.
    We know that the solidarity shown by the Asian and African peoples at the Bandung Conference and developed at the Cairo Conference is an indispensable condition for the victory of the struggle of the Asian and African peoples to win national independence and defeat the conspiracies and interference of the imperialists, whether for the Asian or African people. This solidarity must be constantly consolidated and strengthened until it is fully embodied in all aspects of the normal life of the Asian and African peoples—political, cultural, and economic, civil and official. As long as the Asian-African front remains united, vigilant, and active, the imperialists will not find ways and means to weaken and crush it.
    As an ordinary Sudanese and an ordinary African, let me once again pay tribute to the great Chinese people and assure them that we will always stand with them against the U.S. imperialists; we firmly support the Chinese people's just demand for the recovery of Taiwan, the Chinese territory forcibly occupied by the U.S. invading forces, and their legitimate seat in the United Nations, which has been usurped.
    Before concluding this article, I would like to assure the Chinese people that sooner or later the African people will demand that the imperialists pay off their debts in every corner of Africa in the same or other ways as they do. Let history show in what way this heavily indebted bill will be repaid.

    美帝国主义是个“纸老虎”
    苏丹世界和平委员会总书记　凯尔
    正当你们每天都在欢庆你们的大跃进所产生的新成就的时候，我们从遥远的地方举起手来，越过印度洋，向你们在建设社会主义和胜利前进中所作出的非凡的努力致以敬礼。
    自从万隆会议和开罗会议以来，非洲和亚洲人民、特别是和中国人民之间不断增强的团结，在反对以美国为首的世界帝国主义、争取民族独立和世界和平的共同斗争中，已日益得到巩固。
    新非洲的战鼓已经响遍了这个巨大的大陆的每个角落。“欧洲主人和开化论者”的神话，在照耀着整个非洲的真理的灿烂光辉下被粉碎了。几百年来，帝国主义者用以遮掩自己吮吸我们鲜血的假面目也被撕下，美国、英国、法国帝国主义者和它们的仆从已赤裸裸地暴露在全体非洲人的眼前。
    我们争取自由与和平的斗争旗帜，在阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆、乌干达、多哥、南非以及非洲所有其他的殖民地国家和独立国家，接连不断地高高竖起。这个斗争不仅得到二亿一千万非洲人的支援，而且受到全世界三分之二以上人民的拥护。
    最近美国在台湾地区对中华人民共和国进行的侵略行动，给了非洲人民更多具体的证据来认识美国那令人憎恨的政策的本质；使他们的胸中充满了更大的精力和决心去堵塞美国渗透非洲大陆的道路。
    我非常幸运能够亲眼看见和亲身感受北京三百万示威者为了支持周恩来总理的六点声明而作出的准备和惊人的热情。这种准备给予美帝国主义者干涉中国内政一个决定性的打击，清清楚楚地表明了中国人民的高度自觉，他们之间不可动摇的团结，以及他们对于以毛泽东主席为首的敬爱的领袖们的支持。
    我们本身的经验虽然有限，但是我们已经许多次从实践中体会到，在人民的坚决意志和积极抵抗面前，美帝国主义者总会变得软弱。而他们所制造的种种扰嚷，也不过是胆小鬼用来为自己壮胆的吼叫而已。1957年3月间，美国副总统尼克松到非洲一些国家作访问旅行、推销艾森豪威尔主义和寻求新的方式方法来扩张美国在非洲独立国家的势力的时候，我们的国家（苏丹）就是他访问旅行的目标之一。尼克松到达苏丹那天，每一条街道都涂上了反对他的政府政策的标语——“尼克松，滚回你的国家去”、“打倒艾森豪威尔主义”……等。所有的群众团体都发表声明揭露尼克松这次旅行的真正企图，并且专为迎接他准备了一次规模巨大的示威游行。飞机场和它邻近的街头全部被配备着机关枪的军队占领了。许多城镇的商店和市场举行罢市来表示抗议。在这样的气氛下，美国访问者再也不能公然宣布他是来拉我们接受艾森豪威尔主义的了。1957年3月14日，在一次记者招待会上，他谈到了中立对于苏丹的重要。而当他在招待会上被触怒了的时候，他说：“让苏丹那些如此渴望自由和解放的人到匈牙利去争取它们吧。”
    这次经验以及全国各群众团体和政党对于美国“援助”协定的抵制（1958年3月）——尽管事实上它已在众议院以四票（一百零一票赞成，九十七票反对）的微弱多数被通过——，给了我们又一次证明，就是：在团结起来的人民面前，美帝国主义者不过是一只“纸老虎”！
    我们完全认清了美国对非洲的计划，看到了它的大使馆、公使馆、领事馆、代表团和社团所进行的活动，它们通过这些单位在人民中间进行挑拨离间、鼓吹和宣扬美国生活方式，到处行贿和传播腐化堕落。
    在那些新近获得独立的非洲国家里，美国正在扩展它的势力。它的活动已经扩展到了各个地方，唯一的企图就是把这些国家变成为美国战争机器和战略布置上的车轮。英国和法国帝国主义者在爱国势力的压力下作出的每一个让步和退却，美帝国主义者都加以利用，使它们为自己的根本目的服务。总之，他们正在竭力取代英国和法国的地位。这就是美国今天在非洲的一幅新的图画。
    我们非洲人确信全世界的和平力量、特别是苏联和中国人民将满意地看到非洲人民争取民族独立和解放运动的兴起。仍然处在帝国主义的枷锁下的一亿四千万非洲人民将誓不休止斗争，直到他们成为自己命运的主人。在我们彻底摧毁所有非洲的殖民制度的斗争中，给予我们一切可能的帮助和鼓励，是所有爱好和平的人民永久的正当的义务。
    我们知道亚非人民在万隆会议所显示出来和在开罗会议发展起来的团结，不论对于亚洲或是非洲人民都是争取民族独立、击溃帝国主义者的阴谋破坏和干涉的斗争取得胜利的一个不可缺少的条件。这种团结必须不断巩固和加强，直到它充分地体现在亚非人民正常生活的各个方面——政治、文化和经济，民间的和官方的。而只要亚非阵线一天保持团结、警惕和进行活动，帝国主义者就一天找不到削弱和粉碎它的方法和途径。
    作为一个普通的苏丹人和普通的非洲人，让我再一次向伟大的中国人民致敬，并且保证我们将永远和他们一起反对美帝国主义者；我们坚决支持中国人民对于收回被美国侵略军队强占的中国领土——台湾的正义要求，以及他们在联合国被霸占的合法位置。
    在结束这篇文章之前，我愿意向中国人民担保，非洲人民迟早会用和他们同样的或是另外的办法来要求帝国主义者还清它们在非洲各个角落所欠下的债务。让历史来表明这笔债务累累的账单将要以什么样的方式来偿还吧。
