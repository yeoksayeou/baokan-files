　　II. The Radiance of "Golden Star"
    Now let us look at agriculture. We will not talk about those large-scale state farms using tractors, but only about agricultural cooperatives. The Golden Star Agricultural Cooperative, not far from Harbin city, can serve as an example. In Heilongjiang Province, there are many cooperatives like the Golden Star Cooperative, which means that this cooperative is not even the best.
    Good sanitation is the first good impression this cooperative gives people. There are very few flies, and even the pigsties don't have many flies. The courtyards of the members' homes are swept clean, and the glass windows are sparkling, which is better than some government offices in the city.
    This cooperative has a total of 655 households, with a population of 3,394, of which 1,171 are full laborers (874 men and 297 women). The land area is 1,268 *qing*, and there are also five greenhouses, each 120 square meters.
    Of the more than 1,200 *qing* of land, 240 *qing* are planted with sorghum, soybeans, wheat, and rice, 40 *qing* are planted with feed, and the rest are all planted with vegetables. Last year, the average yield of Chinese cabbage was 800 *jin* per *qing*. Each greenhouse yielded more than 1,000 *jin*. The annual income of each laborer was more than 500 yuan. Last year, the cooperative retained 120,000 yuan in public accumulation funds. These figures illustrate the economic situation of the cooperative.
    The cooperative currently has one tractor and has ordered eight universal tractors; it currently has two freight trucks and has ordered two more; it currently has 77 rubber-tired carts and 300 horses.
    It also raises 57 dairy cows and 561 pigs.
    The cooperative also runs a farm tool repair and assembly factory, a brick factory, a carpentry and iron factory, and a granular fertilizer factory. This fertilizer factory has just been established, with self-made equipment and materials utilizing waste products, simple and economical, but very useful. The technician, worker, and administrator of this fertilizer factory is an experienced old farmer in his fifties or sixties, a local expert. But listening to him talk about the formulation and raw materials of granular fertilizer, his chemical knowledge is actually quite good, at least I am ashamed to admit I'm not as good.
    It is said that the cadres and workers sent to this cooperative come from all walks of life. More than 190 cadres have been sent down.
    The cultural revolution and technological revolution have already begun in this cooperative.
    Educational level of the members: more than 180 are graduates of higher primary school, more than 30 are graduates of junior high school, and more than 30 are new junior high school graduates who have returned from the city; there are six literacy classes, fifty *kang*-head literacy groups, and forty-five teaching and learning groups. Newly established are three middle schools, one of which is regular, with half-day study time and 200 students, and two are amateur, with one hour of study each evening and 58 students.
    On June 9, the Golden Star Cooperative established its own amateur agricultural university (I don't know what rank this amateur agricultural university is in the country), with three departments: agronomy, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and agricultural machinery, with disciplines such as plant physiology, animal husbandry and feeding, veterinary medicine, cultivation and planting, soil, fertilizer, plant protection, agricultural management, seed selection and breeding, agricultural machinery, fruit tree gardening, and farmland water conservancy. There are currently 60 students. Classes are held once a week, for half a day each time (about four hours). The teachers are lecturers from the agricultural college who have been sent down (four people) and the cooperative's technician, Zhao Guozhang (we will talk about him below). The students are mostly experienced old farmers, production team technicians, and middle school students from the countryside recommended by the Party branches of each production team; production team leaders and branch secretaries are all auditors.
    Let us look at the depth and breadth of the cultural revolution in this cooperative from some other facts.
    The cooperative's club library has 6,700 books, the broadcasting room (wired broadcasting) has three large speakers and more than a dozen small speakers, and the entire cooperative can hear the broadcast everywhere in the fields. There are eight fixed blackboard newspapers. There are more than 50 privately owned radios. The cooperative newspaper has been published in two issues (as of when I was there). After "Red Flag" was published, many old members rushed to buy it, and now 100 old members have subscribed to "Red Flag."
    Amateur cultural activities have reached such a scale: a drama troupe has been established for many years, now with 120 people, divided into drama, song and dance, *quyi*, and national music teams. There is a writing group, currently with six people.

　　二、“金星”的光芒
    现在让我们看看农业。我们不谈那些使用拖拉机的大规模的国营农场，只谈农业合作社。离哈尔滨市区不太远的金星农业合作社可以作一个例子。在黑龙江省，像金星社这样的合作社，数量很多，也就是说，这样的社，也还不是最好的。
    卫生工作好，是这个合作社首先给人们的一个好印象。苍蝇很少，猪圈里也不大看见苍蝇。社员们住家的院子打扫得干干净净，玻璃窗擦得煞亮，比城市里有些机关还强些。
    这个社共有六百五十五户，三千三百九十四口，其中全劳动力一千一百七十一人（男八百七十四、女二百九十七）。土地是一千二百六十八垧，还有五个温室，每个一百二十平方公尺。
    一千二百多垧土地中，二百四十垧种高粱、大豆、麦、稻，四十垧种饲料，其余的全种蔬菜。去年大白菜每垧平均收八百斤。每个温室收一千数百斤。一个劳动力一年的收入五百多元。去年社留公积金十二万元。这些数字，就说明了这个社的经济情况。
    这个社现有拖拉机一台，已经订购万能拖拉机八台；现有运货汽车二部，已经订购二部；现有胶皮车七十七部，马三百匹。
    还养了奶牛五十七头、猪五百六十一只。
    社还办了农具修配厂、砖厂、木工铁工厂、颗粒肥料厂。这个肥料厂刚办起来，设备自制，材料利用废旧品，简单而省钱，可是顶用。这个肥料厂的技术员兼工人又兼管理员是一个五、六十岁的很有造肥经验的老农，是一位土专家。可是听他讲颗粒肥料的配制和原料，他的化学知识实在也很不差，至少我是自愧弗如。
    据说，下放到这个社的干部和工人，各行各业都有。下放干部一百九十多人。
    文化革命和技术革命已经在这个社开始。
    社员的文化程度：高小毕业一百八十多，初中毕业三十多，新由城市回来的初中毕业生也是三十多；有六个扫盲班，五十个炕头识字小组，四十五个包教保学组。新办的，有三个中学，其中一个是正规的，半天时间学习，现有学生二百人，两个是业余的，每晚学习一小时，学生五十八人。
    6月9日，金星社成立了社办的业余的农业大学（我不知道这个业余的农业大学在全国算来排行第几），设农学、畜牧兽医、农业机械三个系，植物生理、畜牧饲养、兽医、耕作栽培、土壤、肥料、植物保护、农业经营管理、选种培育、农业机械、果树园艺、农田水利等学科。现有学生六十人。每周上课一次，每次半天（约四小时）。老师是农业学院下放的讲师（四人）和该社的技术员赵国章（我们在下面还要谈到他）。学生大都是各生产队党支部保送来的有生产经验的老农、生产队的技术员和下乡的中学生；各生产队长和支部书记都是旁听生。
    让我们再从另外一些事实来看看这个社的文化革命的深度和广度。
    社的俱乐部图书室有书六千七百册，广播室（有线广播）拥有大喇叭三个，小喇叭十几个，全社的田野间到处可以听到广播，固定的黑板报八块。私人自备的收音机共五十多台。油印社报已出二期（就我在那里的时候说）。“红旗”出版后，许多老社员都抢着买，现在全社已有一百个老社员订阅了“红旗”。
    业余文艺活动达到这样的规模：建立了多年的剧团，现有一百二十人，分为戏剧、歌舞、曲艺、国乐四个队。有一个创作小组，现为六人。
