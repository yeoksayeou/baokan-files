Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th—The No. 1 converter in the new converter workshop of the Shanghai Third Steel Plant produced its first furnace of molten steel at 1:25 this morning. The remaining converters will be put into production in the next few days, with a total annual output of 150,000 tons of steel. Following closely behind, on the 26th, the four steelmaking converters in the newly built large converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 were also completed and put into production. The annual production capacity of both of these steelmaking workshops is 600,000 tons. Both were built using rapid construction methods.

The new workshop of the Shanghai Third Steel Plant took only eighty-six days from the start of construction to the production of the first furnace of steel. During the construction process, the workshop concentrated the strength of design, construction, equipment manufacturing, equipment installation and transportation departments, designing and constructing simultaneously, and starting to install equipment at the same time, thus greatly accelerating the construction speed. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai also strongly supported this construction. After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel nationwide this year, the workers were even more invigorated, regarding the construction of the new workshop as supreme glory. Whether it was day or night, wind or rain, construction never stopped.

Jiangnan Shipyard, Hudong Shipyard, Xinzhong Power Machinery Factory, Turbine Factory, Xin'an Electric Motor Factory and other factories that manufactured equipment for the new workshop not only completed the manufacturing of this part of the smelting equipment as an overriding task, but also sent skilled technicians from the factories to the Shanghai Third Steel Plant to assist in installation and trial operation during the final installation stage. Many cadres and workers were reluctant to leave the workshop for several days and nights in order to complete the installation task ahead of schedule.

Late at night, when the first furnace of boiling steel flowed into the ladle like a waterfall, thunderous applause erupted on the construction site, along with cheers and the sound of gongs, drums, and firecrackers. The steel illuminated the workshop, and people's faces glowed with happiness.

In order to ensure that this workshop was quickly put into full production, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, in the final five days of completion, all relevant collaborating factories worked day and night to complete the project, and sent a large number of technicians to the construction site to assist in installation. Workers and staff of the Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 also participated in voluntary labor in the last few days to clean up the site, so that the heavy finishing work was finally completed in five days.

Now the steelmaking workers in the new converter workshop are stepping up their efforts to skillfully master the operating technology, striving to normalize production in the short term and ensure the completion of the steel production task for the fourth quarter.

    钢铁生力军相继上阵
    上海建成两座大型转炉车间
    新华社上海26日电  上海第三钢厂新转炉车间的第一号转炉今晨一时二十五分炼出了第一炉钢水。其余几只转炉近几日内就要投入生产，总计年内可生产十五万吨钢。紧接着，26日，上钢一厂新建的大型转炉车间的四座炼钢转炉也全部建成投入生产。这两座炼钢车间的年产能力都是六十万吨。都是以快速施工方法建成的。
    上钢三厂的新车间从开工建设到炼出第一炉钢只花了八十六天时间。这座车间在施工过程中集中了设计、施工、设备制造、设备安装等单位，以及交通运输等有关部门的力量，一边设计，一边施工，同时就着手安装设备，因而大大加快了建设速度。中国人民解放军驻沪部队的战士也有力地支援了这项建设。中共中央发出今年全国年产一千零七十万吨钢的号召以后，工人们更加振奋，把建设新车间视为无上的光荣。无论是白天、黑夜、刮风、下雨，施工都不停息。
    为新车间制造设备的江南造船厂、沪东造船厂、新中动力机器厂、汽轮机厂、新安电机厂等厂，不仅把制造这部分冶炼设备作为压倒一切的任务来完成，而且在最后安装阶段还派出厂里熟练的技工到上钢三厂协助安装和试车。很多干部和工人为了提前完成安装任务，几天几夜不肯离开车间。
    深夜，当第一炉沸腾的钢水像瀑布样地流入盛钢桶的时候，工地上响起了暴风雨般的鼓掌声。欢呼声和锣鼓、爆竹声。钢水照得车间通明，人们的脸上发出幸福的红光。
    上钢一厂为了保证使这个车间迅速全部投入生产，在完工的最后五天内，各有关协作工厂日夜突击，并派大批技术工人到工地协助安装。上钢一厂的工人和科室人员，在最后几天内也参加义务劳动，清理场地，使繁重的扫尾工程终于在五天内突击完成。
    现在新转炉车间的炼钢工人正在加紧熟练地掌握操作技术，争取短期内使生产正常，保证完成第四季度的产钢任务。
