Learn from the High-Yield Open Hearth Furnace Red Flag
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

Today, another high-yield red flag on the steel front appears before us. This is the open hearth furnace of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company's Third Steel Plant (referred to as Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant). In August, the utilization coefficient of the plant's open hearth furnace reached 14.225 tons. The "steel material consumption" indicator consumed in steelmaking in the first half of the year was also the most advanced in the country. With a hearth area of one square meter, more than 14 tons of steel are produced per day and night. This is a major achievement of Chinese metallurgical workers, and we should cheer for this high-yield record.

People may ask, what kind of open hearth furnace is the open hearth furnace of Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant, and why can it create such good results? We tell everyone that, just like the Benxi No. 1 Iron Works, which raised the high-yield red flag for blast furnaces, the open hearth furnace of Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant is also an old open hearth furnace with outdated equipment, low degree of mechanization, and unreasonable furnace structure. Up to now, one of the most arduous processes of the open hearth furnace - charging, is still done manually. Such a level is not only far behind the modernized open hearth furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel, but even the open hearth furnaces of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have a much higher degree of mechanization than the open hearth furnace of Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant. The difference is that these old equipment play a greater role in their hands than modern equipment. For example, their open hearth furnace was originally designed to hold 10 tons, but now it holds more than 25 tons. Other open hearth furnaces take five or more hours to refine a furnace of steel, but they only take three to four hours due to the high heat load. Other open hearth furnaces often delay a lot of time due to furnace repairs, and the operating rate rarely reaches 90%, but they maintain the furnace body very well, and the maintenance is fast, and the operation reaches more than 93%. Other open hearth furnaces consume more than 1,000 kilograms of metal materials (excluding added ore) per ton of steel, but they only use 980 to 990 kilograms... In short, they are in the most advanced position in many aspects.

So, what forces do they rely on to make these old equipment play an extraordinary role? Anyone who has been to this open hearth furnace workshop will see that they rely on strong political leadership, high mass awareness, good unity, and great enthusiasm to support the open hearth furnace high-yield red flag for two years. In agriculture, man can conquer nature, and a bumper harvest can be achieved even in drought. People have already seen the facts. In industry, old equipment can also create miracles. Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant has set a brilliant example. Let us introduce the impressions of a visiting group to illustrate this problem. When people see workers using their hands to put all the raw materials into the flame-spraying furnace in more than ten minutes, see people constantly checking the furnace conditions against the flames, see workers quickly removing the residue in front of the furnace door without letting go of a fire brick or a piece of ore that fell in the slag, and picking it out and putting it aside, see the signalman and the gas worker often watching the melting properties on the platform in order to better cooperate with the needs of the open hearth furnace, see the workers who make the stoppers very carefully install the bricks one by one, see the foreman always directing the workers in the entire furnace to complete various tasks in a tense and orderly manner, see the functional departments often busy in the workshop..., people will clearly feel that under the leadership of the Party, a collective with a high degree of class consciousness, a high sense of ownership, and a tightly organized collective has been formed here. With the hard work and wisdom of this collective, any shortcomings in equipment can be overcome." Everyone can see how huge the role of politics and the role of people are.

The high-yield red flags for steel and iron are all in old factories with outdated equipment, while modern new factories rarely have high-yield red flags. What is going on? Are modern factories inferior to factories with old equipment? We have talked about some of this in the article entitled "High-Yield Red Flags Should Be Planted on Blast Furnaces" published on the 9th, and now we need to add a little more. According to common sense, modern new factories have more conditions for setting up high-yield red flags than those old factories with outdated equipment. Who can say that the utilization coefficient of Anshan's open hearth furnace should not be higher than that of Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant? But the problem often lies here. Because these factories have newer equipment, it is easy to create a kind of blind faith in equipment, only seeing the role of equipment and ignoring the role of people. When problems in production need to be solved, the first thing to consider is how to increase equipment, rather than how to mobilize the masses. If the production situation is not good, they always complain about the equipment. Equipment is operated by people. If the work of people is not done well, and the enthusiasm and initiative of people are not fully brought into play, how can the equipment give full play to its role? This is the main reason why those modern factories cannot set up high-yield red flags.

Since the problem is so obvious, those factories with new or relatively new equipment but with very low or relatively low production indicators need to humbly learn from the experience of Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant, learn from them to start from strengthening political leadership and strengthening mass work, relying on the enthusiasm, creativity and close unity of the broad masses of employees to overcome the weaknesses of the equipment and give full play to the role of the equipment. It should be pointed out that the experience of Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant is not just appearing now, but has existed for a long time, but because its open hearth furnace is old and small, it has not attracted the attention of those new and large factories. But facts are always facts. The open hearth furnace of Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant has been leaping forward again and again for two years, and the utilization coefficient has jumped from 11 to 12, and then to 13 and 14, and is now moving towards the goal of 15, while the open hearth furnaces of those steel mills that do not humbly learn from its experience have not exceeded 10, and some are only 6 or 7 (see the comparison table of open hearth furnace utilization coefficient). Such steel mills can only benefit from learning from the experience of Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant, and there will be no harm. Since Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant has been able to increase the utilization coefficient of the open hearth furnace to the world's most advanced level, people have the right to demand that all open hearth furnaces in our country increase the coefficient to 12-14. We hope that the comrades of the open hearth furnace steel mills will intensify their efforts to turn everyone's hope into reality, and erect the bright high-yield red flag high in all open hearth furnace steel mills.

    向平炉高产红旗看齐
    本报评论员
    今天又一面钢铁战线上的高产红旗出现在我们面前，这就是上海钢铁公司第三钢铁厂（简称上钢三厂）的平炉。八月份这个厂子的平炉利用系数已经达到14.225吨。上半年炼钢所消耗的“钢铁料消耗”指标也是全国最先进的。一平方公尺的炉底面积，一昼夜出钢14吨多，这是我国冶金工人一项重大成就，我们应当为这个高产纪录而欢呼。
    人们也许要问，上钢三厂平炉是怎样的平炉，为什么能够创造这样好的成绩？我们告诉大家，正像插起高炉高产红旗的本溪第一炼铁厂一样，上钢三厂的平炉也是设备陈旧的平炉，机械化程度低，炉体结构也不够合理，一直到现在平炉最繁重的工序之一——装料，还用人工。这样的水平，不但远远不及鞍钢的近代化平炉，就是太原钢铁厂、重庆钢铁公司的平炉，机械化程度也比上钢三厂的平炉高得多。所不同的是，这些旧设备在他们手中发挥出比近代化的设备还要大的作用。例如他们的平炉，原来设计的装入量是10吨，但现在装入了25吨以上，别的平炉炼一炉钢要用五个以至五个以上的小时，而他们由于热负荷高，只用三至四小时。别的平炉常常因为修炉耽误许多时间，作业率很少达到90％，而他们由于炉体维护得很好，检修时又快，作业达到93％以上。别的平炉炼一吨钢消耗的金属料（不包括加入的矿石），大部分在一千公斤以上，而他们却只用九百八十至九百九十公斤……总而言之，在许多方面，他们都居于最先进的地位。
    那么，他们靠什么力量，使这些旧设备发挥出不平常的作用呢？凡是到过这个平炉车间的人，都会看出他们靠的是政治领导强、群众觉悟高、团结好、干劲大这些条件，把平炉高产红旗撑了两年之久。在农业上，人定胜天，干旱也能丰收，人们已经看到事实了，在工业上，用陈旧的设备也能创造奇迹，上钢三厂作出了光辉的榜样。让我们介绍一个参观团的观感来说明这个问题。当人们看到工人们用手在十多分钟就把全部原料装进喷着火焰炉子里，看到人在经常不断地顶着火焰检查炉内情况，看到工人们在赶紧清除炉门前残渣时，还不放松掉在渣里一个火砖或一块矿石，而把它捡出放在一边，看到传信工和煤气工常常在平台上看望熔炼性质以便更好的配合平炉的需要时，看到制作塞棒的工人十分细心地把一块一块砖安装十分妥贴，看到工长时时刻刻指挥全炉工人紧张而有条不紊的完成各项工作，看到职能机构人员常在车间忙碌……，人们就会明确地感到，这里在党的领导下，已经形成一个有高度阶级觉悟、有高度主人翁感，而且是严密组织起来的集体。凭着这个集体的辛勤劳动和智慧，任何设备上的缺点，都是可以克服的。”大家可以看出，政治的作用，人的作用，力量是多么巨大。
    钢和铁的高产红旗都出在设备陈旧的老厂，而近代的新厂却很少出现高产红旗，这是怎么一回事呢？难道近代化的工厂反而不如设备旧的工厂吗？这个道理我们在9日发表的题为“高炉上要插高产红旗”的文章里曾经谈过一些，现在还要补充讲一点。按通常道理讲，近代的新厂比起那些设备陈旧的老厂更具有树立高产红旗的条件，谁能说鞍山的平炉的利用系数，不应当比上钢三厂高呢？可是问题往往也就出在这里。因为这些厂子设备较新，就容易使人产生一种迷信设备，只看到设备的作用，忽视人的作用的思想。遇到生产中的问题需要解决时，首先考虑的是如何增加设备，而不是如何发动群众，生产情况不好，也总是埋怨设备不行。设备是由人来操纵的，人的工作没有做好，人的积极性、主动性没有充分发挥出来，设备怎能充分发挥作用呢？这就是那些近代化工厂树不起高产红旗的主要原因。
    问题既然这样明显，那就需要那些设备新或比较新而生产指标却很低或比较低的工厂，虚心学习上钢三厂的经验，学习他们的从加强政治领导，加强群众工作着手，依靠广大职工的积极性、创造性和紧密的团结，来克服设备上的弱点，充分发挥设备的作用。应当指出，上钢三厂的经验不是现在刚刚出现，而是早已存在的，可是由于它的平炉又旧又小，没有引起那些又新又大的工厂的重视。但事实总是事实，上钢三厂的平炉两年来一再跃进，利用系数从11跃到12，再跃到13、14，现在又向15的目标前进，而那些不虚心学习它的经验的炼钢厂的平炉，利用系数都没有超过10，有的只有6、7（见平炉利用系数的比较表）。这样的炼钢厂，学习上钢三厂的经验，只能有好处，决不会有坏处。上钢三厂既然能够把平炉利用系数提高到世界最先进的水平，人们就有权利要求我国所有的平炉都把系数提高到12——14。我们希望平炉炼钢厂的同志加紧努力，把大家的希望变成现实，在所有的平炉炼钢厂，都高高地树起鲜艳的高产红旗。
