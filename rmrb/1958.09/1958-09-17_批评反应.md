Criticism Response

    Efforts to Avoid Stockpiling Goods
    Comrade Wen De's criticism in the reader's letter column of your newspaper on August 28 regarding the stockpiling of goods at our station is entirely true. This is mainly due to the poor planning of our station personnel, which resulted in the stockpiling and affected production. In addition to instructing those responsible to conduct a review, we will definitely pay close attention in the future to avoid similar situations from happening again.

    The Problem of Stockpiled Double-Share Plows Resolved
    After your newspaper published Comrade Zhang Xi's letter on August 7 criticizing the Gaobeidian Transfer Station of the Baoding Special District Commercial Bureau for stockpiling double-share plows, the Hebei Provincial Supervision Department and the Baoding Prefectural Commissioner's Office Supervision Office immediately conducted an inspection and handling in coordination with the Commercial Bureau. Currently, all the stockpiled double-share plows in Gaobeidian have been distributed. In addition to reviewing bureaucratic and conservative thinking, the Baoding Special District Commercial Bureau is also working to thoroughly investigate stockpiled means of production and vigorously support agricultural production.

    批评反应
    努力避免积压货物
    文德同志8月28日在你报读者来信栏对我站积压货物的批评，完全属实。这主要是因为我站经办人员计划不周，以致造成积压，影响生产。我们除责成责任者进行检查外，今后一定严格注意，避免再有类似情况发生。

    积压双铧犁的问题解决了
    你报8月7日发表了张熙同志批评保定专区商业局高碑店转运站积压双铧犁的信件以后，河北省监察厅、保定专署监察处立即协同商业局进行了检查处理。目前已将高碑店积压的双铧犁全部下放。保定专区商业局除检查了官僚主义和保守思想外，并设法彻底清查积压的生产资料，大力支援农业生产。
