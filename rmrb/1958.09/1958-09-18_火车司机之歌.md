    Song of the Train Driver
    Riding the east wind, driving the "giant dragon,"
    Competing with rockets, comparing to satellites,
    Pulling steel higher than mountains,
    Transporting oil as deep as the sea.
    Safe and punctual,
    Saving coal, with no transport delays,
    Transporting countless materials,
    Fully loaded with happiness, flying forward!

    火车司机之歌
    乘东风，驾“巨龙”
    赛火箭，比卫星，
    拉的钢铁比山高，
    运的石油像海深。
    又安全，又正点，
    省煤炭，无运缓，
    运送的物资数不完，
    满载着幸福飞向前！
