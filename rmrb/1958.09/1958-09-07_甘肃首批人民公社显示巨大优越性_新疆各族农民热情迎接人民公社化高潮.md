Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, September 6th: The rural areas of Gansu Province have established 183 people's communes. These people's communes are distributed in most counties and cities of the province. Among them, Wushan and Lintao counties and the suburbs of Lanzhou City, which have progressed the fastest, have realized the people's commune system.

　　Established only ten days or so ago, this batch of people's communes has initially shown great superiority in production, life, and ideology. After the establishment of the Hero People's Commune in Gaolan County, the sixty-li-long arid barren mountain area in Shidong Town, where the original Zhuangziping Agricultural Cooperative was located, can be immediately treated. More than 400 people were sent from the original three agricultural cooperatives, including Guojiaping, to assist, making up for the lack of labor in the original Zhuangziping Agricultural Cooperative. The role played by the Yantan People's Commune in Lanzhou City is even more prominent. This people's commune has done four major things in the recent short period that the agricultural cooperatives could not do in the past: First, it solved the problem of insufficient transportation capacity of the original Lanzhou Melon Agricultural Cooperative and Yantan Agricultural Cooperative, avoided the loss of melon, fruit and vegetables being piled up and mildewed, and ensured the timely supply of melons, fruits and vegetables to Lanzhou City. Second, without affecting the normal progress of production, it solved the problem of insufficient manpower to support the construction of the Yantan Yellow River Bridge and the greening of Gaolan Mountain by the state. Third, it solved the problem of insufficient economic strength for the large-scale construction of vegetable greenhouses. Fourth, it set up public canteens, kindergartens, and other organizations to liberate women from household labor. On the third and fourth days after the establishment of the commune, more than 11,000 people were mobilized, weeding, thinning, and preventing insect pests on a total of 10,690 mu.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 6th: The enthusiasm of people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region for establishing people's communes is soaring. More than 100 people's communes in the region are being piloted and preparing for the pilot. The Party committees at all levels in the autonomous region have recently held meetings to study various issues related to the establishment of people's communes, and adopted a comprehensive planning and universal pilot project to welcome the upsurge of people's communes in the autonomous region. All agricultural counties (autonomous counties) in the autonomous region will first build a batch of people's communes before National Day.

　　Agriculture in the autonomous region has realized advanced cooperativization. After the rectification campaign and the socialist education movement, farmers of all ethnic groups have distinguished between the major rights and wrongs of the two roads of socialism and capitalism in the countryside. The struggle against local nationalism has achieved a decisive victory. Agricultural production is continuously leaping forward, and national unity is further strengthened. All of this has promoted the unprecedented rise of socialist consciousness among farmers of all ethnic groups. Since the summer of this year, farmers of all ethnic groups have generally felt that the current small-scale agricultural cooperatives with only one hundred households or so can no longer meet the requirements of large-scale development of production, and they have requested the merger of cooperatives. In the autumn production, many agricultural cooperatives have in fact worked together. After the news of the establishment of people's communes in the interior was published in the newspapers, the masses of farmers of all ethnic groups were in high spirits and demanded the merger of cooperatives and the establishment of people's communes. Many places wrote letters, made phone calls, and sent people to request that pilot projects of people's communes be carried out in their areas first. In order to welcome the establishment of the people's commune, the farmers in the Wuxing Cooperative area of ​​Turpan plan to reclaim 3,000 mu of wasteland in more than 20 days. Grapes, which used to take 20 days to harvest, were harvested in just five days this year.

　　甘肃首批人民公社显示巨大优越性
    新疆各族农民热情迎接人民公社化高潮
    新华社兰州6日电　甘肃省农村已建立起一百八十三个人民公社。这些人民公社分布在全省多数县、市，其中进度最快的武山、临洮两县和兰州市郊区已实现了人民公社化。
    建立起来到现在只十几天的这批人民公社，已经在生产、生活和思想等各方面初步显示出了巨大的优越性。皋兰县英雄人民公社成立后，原庄子坪农业社所在地石洞镇内六十里长的干旱荒山马上可以开始治理，由原郭家坪等三个农业社派来四百多人协助，补足了原庄子坪农业社劳力的不足。兰州市雁滩人民公社显示出来的作用就更突出。这个人民公社在最近短短的几天内已办了过去农业社不能做到的四件大事：一、解决了原兰瓜农业社和雁滩农业社运输力不足的问题，避免了瓜果蔬菜堆积霉烂的损失，保证了对兰州市瓜果蔬菜的及时供应；二、在不影响生产正常进行下，解决了支援国家修雁滩黄河大桥和绿化皋兰山人力不足的问题；三、解决了大修蔬菜温室经济力量不足的问题；四、办了公共食堂，幼儿园等组织，使妇女从家务劳动中脱出身来，在公社成立后的第三、四天，就出动了一万一千多人次，共除草、间苗和防虫害一万零六百九十亩。
    新华社乌鲁木齐6日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民要求建立人民公社的热情高涨，全区已有一百多个人民公社正在试办和进行试办的准备工作。自治区各级党委最近纷纷召开会议，研究建立人民公社的各种问题，采取全面规划和普遍试办同时进行，迎接自治区人民公社化的高潮。全自治区的各个农业县（自治县），都将在国庆节前首先建成一批人民公社。
    自治区的农业已实现了高级合作化；经过整风和社会主义教育运动以后，各族农民分清了农村中社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大是大非；反对地方民族主义的斗争取得了决定性的胜利；农业生产正在不断向前跃进，民族团结进一步加强。所有这些，促进各民族农民社会主义觉悟空前高涨。今年夏季以来，各族农民普遍感到当前现有的百十来户的小规模的农业社已不能适应大规模发展生产的要求，纷纷要求并社。许多农业社在秋季生产中，事实上已经合在一起工作。当内地建立人民公社的消息在报纸上公布以后，各族农民群众情绪昂扬，纷纷要求并社和建立人民公社，不少地方写信、打电话，派人要求先在他们那里试办人民公社。为了迎接人民公社的成立，吐鲁番五星社一带的农民计划在二十多天内开垦出三千亩荒地。往年需要二十天才能收摘完的葡萄，今年五天内就摘收完毕。
