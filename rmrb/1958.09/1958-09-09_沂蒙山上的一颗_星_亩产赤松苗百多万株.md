　　A "Star" on Yimeng Mountain
    Over One Million Red Pine Seedlings per Mu Produced

　　The Daqing Forestry Farm in Pingyi County, Shandong Province, is located on the Muliandun Peak of the Yimeng Mountains, at an altitude of over 700 meters. The forestry farm cultivated 30 mu of red pine seedlings, producing a total of 33.6 million seedlings this year, an average yield of 1.12 million seedlings per mu, more than ten times the previous yield. The highest yield per mu was 1.33 million seedlings. The seedlings are now growing vigorously, with neat and strong seedlings in the seedbeds, ready for planting this winter and next spring.

　　The main reason for the high yield of red pine seedlings at the Daqing Forestry Farm is that they broke the old conventions that red pine seedling cultivation in mountainous areas should not involve fertilization, watering, or deep plowing. The nursery land was deep plowed by more than one chi, and 12,000 jin of fertilizer was applied per mu. Secondly, they adopted intensive planting, pest control, and disease prevention measures. Now, the factory workers have put forward a bold slogan for next year's seedling cultivation: an average yield of 2 million seedlings per mu, with high-yield fields reaching 5 million seedlings.

### 沂蒙山上的一颗“星”  亩产赤松苗百多万株

　　沂蒙山上的一颗“星”
    亩产赤松苗百多万株
    山东省平邑县大清林场建立在海拔七百公尺以上的沂蒙山马连墩高峰上。林场里培育了三十亩赤松苗，今年共产苗三千三百六十万株，平均亩产一百一十二万株，比往年增产十倍多；其中最高的一亩产苗一百三十三万株。现在幼苗生长旺盛，畦苗整齐茁壮，今冬明春即可出圃造林。
    大清林场赤松苗获得高产的主要原因，是打破了过去所谓赤松在山地育苗不施肥、不浇水和不深翻土地的陈规，把苗圃地深翻一尺多，每亩施肥一万二千斤。其次是采取了密植、防虫、防病等技术措施。现在该厂职工又提出了明年育苗平均亩产二百万株，丰产田要达到五百万株的豪迈口号。
