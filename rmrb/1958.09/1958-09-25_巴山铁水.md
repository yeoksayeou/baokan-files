    Bashan Iron Smelting
    Yuan Ying
    Setting up ironworks in the clouds and mist, heroes from all walks of life head to the battlefield,
    Furnace fire soars to the sky above, molten iron rivals the Yangtze below.
    This folk song from Wanxian Prefecture, Sichuan Province, speaks of the people in the Daba Mountains vigorously developing the steel industry. The Daba Mountains stretch across nine counties in Wanxian Prefecture. This vast area consists mainly of virgin forests and undeveloped barren mountains. It cradles endless wealth, sleeping soundly for tens of millions of years. Only this year, with the Great Leap Forward's bugle call mobilizing the steel army, did they climb the hundreds of miles of peaks and ridges, finally awakening the Daba Mountains from their slumber.

    The first to arrive in the mountains were a group of fearless, bold, and meticulous people. Regardless of the scorching sun or continuous rain, they always carried their bags, wielding hammers, knocking and tapping everywhere, searching for ore veins. Are they all exploration experts, you ask? No, most of them were dealing with mines for the first time in their lives, and many had never even seen what iron ore looked like. A village party secretary in Zhong County carried a bag up the mountain to find ore. When he saw a slightly unusual stone, he picked it up. After filling a bag, he carried it down the mountain to have it identified. Many peaks in the Daba Mountains have never been visited. Didn’t Du Fu describe it as "The passes reach the sky, only birds can fly"? Now, to find iron ore, even the cliffs where birds cannot fly bear the footprints of the steel pioneers.

    Once iron was found, the mountains resounded with the sound of gunpowder explosions and the vibration of drills. Winding paths appeared on the steep mountain walls, and a constant stream of people carried ore. Thus, in two or three months, small blast furnaces and indigenous blast furnaces appeared one after another, in groups.

    We stayed overnight at an iron smelting plant in the depths of the mountains in Fengjie County. There, a 21-cubic-meter blast furnace was operating, and another blast furnace of the same size was being built day and night. There, coke had to be transported from more than ten kilometers away. Without roads, it was carried by people and transported by animal-drawn carts, not a minute could be wasted. The workers often worked continuously for more than ten or twenty hours. One sand-casting worker told me that he had been working continuously for sixteen hours, but he didn't feel tired at all. He said, "Our party secretary has been working there since last night until now. How can we rest?" The director of the Qingzhuangping Iron Plant and the director of the agricultural cooperative in Wuxi County covered the blast furnace with their own quilts and clothes during a heavy rainstorm to prevent it from collapsing. They persevered in the rain for half the night, protecting the safety of the furnace. Eighteen girls in Wuyang District, Zhong County, originally decided to get married, some had already received their marriage certificates, but in order to wholeheartedly learn technology and build blast furnaces, they all postponed their weddings. The communist spirit and broad minds of the youth of our time are inexhaustible and indescribable!

    We went to the prefectural committee and couldn't find the first secretary; we went to the county committee and couldn't find the first secretary; they had all gone to the front lines. In Fengjie County, we heard that the first secretary was at an iron smelting plant in the mountains. When we arrived, he had gone to another iron smelting plant three days earlier, where some technical problems had occurred. The mountain road was rugged, but he still rushed there overnight. In the deep mountains at night, besides the singing of the blast furnaces, the crisp sound of telephone bells could be heard everywhere. This was the prefectural or county committee convening a telephone conference; this was the district or township inquiring about today's iron output figures; this was the steel headquarters mobilizing teams, transferring them from one district to support another; this was the commander of each front-line position reporting good news to the higher authorities...

    The factory director and the factory party secretary are the commanders of the front-line positions. They stayed by the furnace day and night, carefully observing every change in the blast furnace. From every expression on their faces, you could see how the molten iron was churning, or what new difficulties had arisen in which department. In their lives, you could hardly find the word "rest." When they returned from the blast furnace or the mine, sitting in the office to take a breath, they were always discussing how to overcome a certain technical difficulty, or talking to the workers, asking experienced workers for advice, or gently persuading some newly arrived migrant workers to settle down in that crowded workshop and not to be emotional. The blast furnace and the construction site were all on a three-shift system, operating non-stop all night. Even if they had three or four hours to sleep in bed, someone would still come to them with a phone call. Besides, when one of the furnaces had not yet reached its normal or expected output, how could they close their eyes?

    The masses of the people are the supporters of our steel army. As soon as they heard that we were going to develop the steel industry and catch up with Britain, they gave us people if we needed them, and things if we needed them. People didn't mind the high mountains and long distances, going up the mountains to find ore, going down the mountains to transport ore, carrying sand and earth, and carrying pig iron; people donated all the scrap copper and iron in their homes. The people of Wanxian Prefecture have a special hatred for imperialism. More than thirty years ago, they heard the sound of British warships' cannons with their own ears, and saw with their own eyes how the shameless pirates rampaged unbridled into the Three Gorges, coming to the foot of the Daba Mountains; many of their relatives and friends died under the fire of imperialism. More than ten years ago, American soldiers rampaged here again, lawlessly. The people of Wanxian Prefecture have melted their old hatred and new grievances into the soaring enthusiasm for vigorously developing the steel industry.

    If there were no support and participation from the masses of the people, how could such a miracle occur? – Jiangkou District, Yunyang County, did not ask the higher authorities for a single person or a single penny, but built more than one hundred indigenous blast furnaces, each furnace producing iron; they also proudly announced: this year they will achieve 1,000 kilograms of iron per person, turning their hometown into a steel district. When it comes to using scrap copper and iron to build iron factories, there are endless new things and countless people who have taken out copperware and jewelry that they have hidden for many years to invest in building iron factories! Zhou Xizhen, a woman from Jindai Township, Liangping County, had been collecting firewood for many years before liberation, accumulating one hundred and twenty copper coins one by one. This time, she took them all out and handed them over to the township to build an iron factory. One hundred and twenty copper coins is not much, but is her loyal heart of loving socialism and building socialism something that can be measured by money?

    Now, small blast furnaces stand like stars scattered across the Daba Mountains, and molten iron flows endlessly like the waters of the Sichuan River. On the Yangtze River, steamboats tow barges, transporting ship after ship of pig iron out of the mountains and to Chongqing, where the steelmaking furnaces are opening their smiling faces, waiting for them.

    On autumn nights, the stars are twinkling, the sky is high and the air is crisp. At this time, it always makes one think of a folk song from Wanxian Prefecture: "The stars in the sky are shining brightly, you can't count them one by one; there are thousands of iron factories in the mountains, and the chimneys are like a large forest." Looking into the distance, in that lush green mountain range, it seems that thousands of red lights are flashing, those are not stars, those are so many small blast furnaces producing iron! Look, thousands of golden snake-like molten iron are roaring out...

    巴山铁水
    袁鹰
    云雾里办炼铁厂，各路英雄上战场，
    头上炉火冲青天，脚下铁水赛长江。
    四川省万县专区的这首民歌，说的是大巴山里人民大搞钢铁的事。大巴山脉绵延在万县专区九个县，莽莽苍苍的一片除了原始森林，就是没有开发的荒山荒岭。它怀抱着无穷无尽的财富，沉沉地睡了几千万年。直到今年，大跃进的号角催动着钢铁大军，从四面八方攀上了横亘几百里的峰峦，才把大巴山从沉睡中惊醒过来。
    大巴山最早迎接上山来的，是一群天不怕、地不怕、勇敢又细心的人。不管赤日炎炎还是连天阴雨，他们总是背着口袋，拿着钉锤，到处敲敲打打，寻找矿苗。你道他们都是勘探专家么？不，他们大都是有生以来头一回同矿山打交道，有许多人从来也没看过铁矿是啥样子。忠县有位乡支部书记，背着口袋上山找矿，看见有点异样的石头，就采一块，这样采了一口袋，背下山来找人辨认。大巴山区有许多山峰，是从来没有人到过的。杜甫当年，不是描写过这里是“关塞极天惟鸟道”吗？如今，为了找寻铁矿，连鸟也飞不上去的悬崖峭壁，也留下了钢铁尖兵们的脚印了。
    找到了铁，山上便响彻了火药爆炸声和钻头的震击声，直上直下的山壁上便出现了蜿蜒的羊肠小路，便出现川流不息的挑运矿石的队伍。于是，两三个月里，小高炉、土高炉便一个个、一群群地出现了。
    我们曾在奉节县深山里的一个炼铁厂里住过一夜。那里，有一个二十一立方公尺的高炉，现在正在日夜赶建另一个同它一样大的高炉。那里，焦炭要从十多公里外运来，没有公路，就用人挑，用兽力车运，反正一分一秒也不能耽误。工人们常是连着干十多二十个小时，有一个翻砂工人告诉我，他已经连着干了十六个小时了，可是一点不觉得累。他说：“我们党委书记从昨天夜里起直到现在还在那里干，我们怎能去休息？”巫溪县青庄坪铁厂厂长和农业社主任，在大雷雨的夜里，用自己的棉被和衣服，把高炉盖住，不让它被雷雨冲垮。他们在雨里坚持了半夜，保护了炉子的安全。忠县乌羊区有十八个姑娘，原来决定要结婚了，有的已经领了结婚证，但是为了全心全意学技术，建高炉，她们一起延迟了婚期。我们时代青年人的共产主义风格和磅礴胸怀，是写不尽，说不完的！
    我们到地委会，找不到地委第一书记；到县委会，找不到县委第一书记；他们都到前沿阵地去了。在奉节县，我们听说第一书记在山区里的一个炼铁厂，当我们赶到，他却在三天前又到另一个炼铁厂去了，那里发生一些技术上的问题。山路崎岖，可是他仍然连夜赶去了。山区的深夜，除了高炉在歌唱，到处都能听到清脆的电话铃声，这是地委或者县委在召集电话会议；这是区里、乡里在询问今天的出铁数字；这是钢铁指挥部在调动队伍，从这个区去支援那个区；这是每一个前沿阵地的指挥员在向上级报捷……
    厂长和厂党委书记就是前沿阵地的指挥员。他们日日夜夜守在炉旁，仔细观察高炉的每一个变化。你能从他们的每一个神色里，看到铁水怎样在翻滚，或是哪个部门又发生了新的困难。你从他们的生活里，几乎找不到“休息”这个东西。当他们从高炉或者矿洞回来，坐在办公室里歇口气的时候，也总是在商量怎样突破技术上的某一个困难，或者同工人谈话，向老师傅请教，或者就是娓娓地劝告一些新来的民工在那个挤满了的工房里安住下来，不要闹情绪。高炉和基建工地，都是三班制，通宵不息，即使他们有三、四个钟点能睡上床，也还是会有人有电话来找，再说，当其中有一个炉子出铁还没有正常、预计的产量还没有达到的时候，他们又怎么能闭得上眼呢？
    人民群众，是我们钢铁队伍的支持者，一听到要办钢铁工业，要赶上英国，真是要人有人，要东西有东西。人们不辞山高水远，上山去找矿，下山运矿石，挑砂土，挑生铁；人们把家里的废铜烂铁全都献了出来。万县地区的人民，对帝国主义是有特殊的仇恨的，三十多年前，他们就亲耳听到过英国军舰的炮声，就亲眼看到过那个无耻的海盗怎样横行无忌地闯入三峡，来到大巴山下；他们的多少亲友，就死在帝国主义的炮火下。十多年前，美国兵又在这里横冲直撞，无法无天。万县地区的人民，把旧恨新仇都溶化在大搞钢铁的冲天干劲里了。
    你想，如果没有人民群众的支持和参加，怎么能出现这样的奇迹？——云阳县江口区没有向上级要一人一钱，就办了一百多个土高炉，炉炉出铁；他们还自豪地宣布：今年要达到每人一千斤铁，把自己的家乡变成钢铁区。说到用废铜旧铁大办铁工厂，那是说不完的新鲜事，数不清有多少人把藏了好多年的铜器、首饰拿出来，投资办铁厂！梁平县金带乡妇女周希珍，解放前长年打柴，一个一个地积蓄了一百二十个铜板，这回，她全都拿出来，交给乡里办铁厂。一百二十个铜板不算多，可是，她的热爱社会主义、建设社会主义的赤胆忠心，难道是能用金钱计算得出的么？
    如今，小高炉星罗棋布地在大巴山区矗立起来了，铁水像川江水一样滔滔长流。长江上，汽船顶着驳船，把一船船的生铁运出山区，运到重庆去，那里的炼钢炉正张开笑脸，等待着它们。
    秋天的夜晚，繁星点点，天高气爽。这时候，总使人想起万县地区的一首民歌：“天上星星亮晶晶，一颗一颗数不清；山区铁厂千万个，烟囱好比大森林。”纵目远望，那一片葱葱郁郁的丛山峻岭里，仿佛正闪烁着千万点红光，那不是星星，那是多少小高炉正在出铁啊！你瞧，千条万条金蛇般的铁水呼啸着奔驰出来了……
