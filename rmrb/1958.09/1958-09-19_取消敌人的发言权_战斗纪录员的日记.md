    Denying the Enemy's Voice
    ——Diary of a Combat Recorder
    Liu Shanzheng
    In the afternoon, the gunners were chatting at their positions. Whenever the conversation turned to the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the opposite islands constantly provoking us, and sending reinforcements and generals from Taiwan, they couldn't contain the anger in their hearts... Just then, the telephone line from the command post to the battalion suddenly rang. This ring was a little different from usual, and we all fell silent. We saw Company Commander Liu hold the telephone receiver close to his ear, repeating loudly: "First-level combat readiness!" "First-level combat readiness!" The company commander hurriedly handed the telephone to Deputy Company Commander Xu, ordering all sentries to their battle stations! After a while, the sentry posts reported one after another: The whole company is ready! The friendly units to the northwest had already begun to bombard the eastern side of Jinmen Island with fierce artillery fire, and these lightning-like flashes, like the stars just emerging in the night sky, flickered incessantly on Jinmen Island. In an instant, thousands of columns of thick smoke rose from Jinmen Island.
    At our gun positions, we were both happy and anxious. Company Commander Liu, with his eyes fixed, observed the enemy being beaten through the commander's periscope, while holding the telephone receiver tightly to his ear...
    Everyone concentrated and almost held their breath, waiting for the firing order from above. The command post appeared particularly tense and quiet.
    We waited and waited, and the firing order finally arrived. The deputy company commander shouted the order from above in a loud voice, almost audible several miles away. Following his command, every position and every hill was shaking. The sound of cannons and motors mixed together, making it impossible to distinguish whether this earth-shattering roar was thunder, an earthquake, or artillery fire?
    The enemy's artillery was also firing desperately. As the artillery fire went back and forth, it seemed to raise a rainbow of artillery fire over the strait. Our artillery fire became more and more fierce. Every gunner, wearing a steel helmet as in regular drills, calmly controlled their respective actions. Wan Zelin and Zhang Huafa, the two ammunition handlers, shuttled back and forth in the trenches to deliver ammunition. Our cannons fired together, fiercely bombarding the enemy's positions. The enemy could not raise their heads and were beaten into a desperate situation. Ten... twenty... forty minutes passed, and the enemy's artillery became quieter and quieter, and soon became mute!

    取消敌人的发言权
    ——战斗纪录员的日记
    刘善政
    下午，炮手们在炮位上谈天，大家一讲到对面岛上的蒋贼军不断挑衅，并且从台湾向那里增兵遣将，就抑止不住心头的怒火……。就在这时，突然指挥所通向营里的电话铃响了起来。这个铃声和往常有点异样，我们都静下来。只见刘连长把耳朵贴紧电话机，大声重复着：“一级备战！”“一级备战！”连长忙把电话机子递给徐副连长，传令各哨人员进入战位！一会儿，各哨所纷纷报告：全连准备好！西北面友邻部队，已轰隆轰隆地用猛烈的炮火开始向金门岛东面射击了，这闪电般的火光，像夜空刚露出的繁星一样不停地在金门岛上闪烁着，霎时，金门岛上冒起万股浓烟。
    我们在炮位上，看得既高兴又着急，刘连长目不转睛地一面通过指挥镜观察着敌人挨打的情景，一面把电话听筒紧靠在耳边……
    大家都集中精神，几乎都屏住呼吸等待着上级的射击命令，指挥所显得格外紧张、肃静。
    我们等待又等待，射击命令终于到来了，副连长大嗓门传出上级的命令，几乎几里地以外都可以听到他的声音。随着他的口令，各个阵地，各个山头都在颤动了，炮声和电动机声混合一起，使人们无法辨明这惊天动地的巨响究竟是雷声是地震还是炮声？
    敌人的炮火也在拚命地射击着，炮火一来一往，在海峡上好像升起一道道炮火的长虹。我们的炮火越打越猛，每个炮手戴上钢盔像平时操练那样，沉着地掌握各自的动作。万泽林和张化法两位运弹手穿梭似地在交通壕里运送弹药。我们的大炮，一齐发射，猛烈轰击敌人的阵地。敌人抬不起头，被打得走投无路了。十分……二十分……四十分钟过去了，敌人大炮的嗓门越来越小，一会儿就变成哑吧了！
