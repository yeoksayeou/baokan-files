    Labor Reaps a Bumper Harvest
    The fourth-year students of the Chemistry Department of Beijing Normal University, in the short three months since the implementation of educational reform in the school, have already established five small and medium-sized factories and workshops, and six large and small schools. They have successfully trial-produced 57 kinds of new chemical products, of which 3-5 dinitro salicylic acid and pyrogallic acid have reached and exceeded the level of imported goods. While running factories and schools, they also participated in the school's teaching reform, compiled outlines for all subjects in the department (eight types), and are cooperating with relevant units to compile teaching materials and experimental lectures for junior high schools, senior high schools, universities, and secondary technical schools.
    Comrades who could not even name the tools in the past can now manufacture various teaching model apparatus and sulfuric acid factory models in the teaching aid factory, without even looking at the blueprints.
    Facts have proved that the combination of education and productive labor not only does not affect the quality of learning but also improves it. Thirty-two students now go to factories every week to teach classes in universities and secondary schools, and they all teach very well. They have also compiled a complete set of teaching materials combined with the actual production for the factories. In the past, students did experiments by "prescribing medicine according to a prescription," following the steps in the lecture notes, but afterwards, they forgot everything. This time, through scientific research and trial-production of new products, they no longer rely on experimental lecture notes, but work independently and find reference materials. Instruments such as electric drying ovens and vacuum distillation equipment are all operated by the students themselves through exploration. (Baitian)

    劳动获丰收
    北京师范大学化学系四年级的同学们，在学校实行教育改革以来的短短三个月中，他们已经办起了中小型工厂、车间五个，大、中学校六个，试制成功化学新产品五十七种，其中3—5二硝基水杨酸和焦性没食子酸达到和超过了进口货水平。在办厂办学的同时，他们还参加了学校的教学改革，编写了全系各科大纲（八种），并正在和有关单位合作，编写初中、高中、大学、中等技术学校的教材和实验讲义。
    过去叫不出工具名字的同志在教具厂劳动，已经能制造出各种教具模型，硫酸工厂模型，不用看图就能制造。
    事实证明，教育与生产劳动结合，不但不会影响学习质量，而且提高了学习质量。同学们现在每周有三十二人去工厂教大、中学校的课，都教得很好。他们还为工厂编出整套结合生产实际的教材。同学们过去做实验是“照方配药”，按讲义步骤去做，但过后，忘记得一干二净。这次通过科学研究试制新产品，就不再依靠实验讲义了，自己独立工作，找参考资料，像电烘箱、减压蒸馏等仪器，就都是同学们自己摸索操作的。  （白天）
