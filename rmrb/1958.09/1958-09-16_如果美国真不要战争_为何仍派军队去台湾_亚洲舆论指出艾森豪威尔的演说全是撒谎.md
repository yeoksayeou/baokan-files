Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 14th. The "Rangoon Daily" commented on the 14th that Eisenhower's speech on September 11th sounded like "empty cannons being fired from the mouth." The newspaper said, if the United States truly doesn't want war, why are they still sending planes and warships to Taiwan? The newspaper pointed out that it was China, not the United States, that took the initiative in suggesting the resumption of Sino-American talks.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 14th. Indian newspapers, commenting on Eisenhower's recent speech, pointed out how out of touch he is.

The Madras "Hindu" wrote that the United States must recognize that "today's China is not the China of 1950." The newspaper also said that China is bound to be angry about the Western countries and the defeated Kuomintang bandits blockading its ports and infringing on its territorial waters.

The Hindi "Nava Bharat Times" condemned Eisenhower for still engaging in military intimidation in his television speech.

"Free Press" said that the US president, in analyzing the Pacific situation, clearly overlooked the need to recognize "Beijing's legitimate status in the Pacific and the world."

The "Bombay Chronicle" believes that Eisenhower's statement "lacks realism and ingenuity."

Even the English-language "Times of India," which echoed some of Eisenhower's views, had to admit that there is a growing outcry within the United States condemning the U.S. policy toward China.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 13th. The Indonesian "Harian Rakjat" said in an editorial today that Eisenhower's speech shows that the United States can no longer ignore the China factor and China's role in world affairs.

The editorial also said that, however, the speech indicates that the United States still will not recognize China's sovereignty over Taiwan. The editorial said that if the United States continues to insist on this stubborn attitude, the upcoming Sino-American talks will inevitably be deadlocked.

The editorial emphasized that during the Sino-American talks, China is only prepared to discuss the issue of the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait caused by U.S. interference in China's internal affairs. As for resolving the Taiwan issue, this is China's internal affair and has nothing to do with the United States.

The newspaper pointed out that the United States is currently isolated in its approach to China. The newspaper also said that the United States should know its own position.

The Indonesian National News Agency reported today that Indonesian parliamentarians, who expressed their views on the Taiwan Strait situation, unanimously believe that Jinmen and Mazu belong to China.

    如果美国真不要战争
    为何仍派军队去台湾
    亚洲舆论指出艾森豪威尔的演说全是撒谎
    新华社仰光14日电　“仰光日报”在14日评论说，艾森豪威尔9月11日发表的演说，听来好像是
  “嘴巴上放的空炮”。这家报纸说，如果美国真正不要战争，为什么仍在把飞机和军舰派往台湾呢？这家报纸指出，在建议恢复中美会谈方面采取主动的是中国而不是美国。
    新华社新德里14日电　印度报纸在评论艾森豪威尔最近发表的演说时指出他多么不识时务。
    马德拉斯“印度教徒报”写道，美国必须认识到“今天的中国已经不是1950年的中国了”。这家报纸还说，中国必然对西方国家和那些被打败了的国民党徒封锁它的港口和侵犯它的领海感到愤怒。
    印地文“新印度时报”谴责艾森豪威尔在它的电视演说中还在进行军事恫吓。
    “自由新闻”说，美国总统在分析太平洋局势中显然地忽略了必须承认“北京在太平洋以及世界上的合法地位”这一点。
    “孟买纪事报”认为，艾森豪威尔的声明“缺乏现实主义和机智”。
    甚至附和艾森豪威尔的一些观点的英文“印度时报”也不得不承认，在美国国内谴责美国对华政策的呼声越来越强烈了。
    新华社雅加达13日电　印度尼西亚“东星报”今天在社论中说，艾森豪威尔的演说表明，美国已经不能在世界事务中再无视中国的因素和中国的作用了。
    社论又说，然而，这篇演说表示美国仍旧不会承认中国对台湾的主权。社论说，如果美国继续坚持这种顽固态度的话，即将举行的中美会谈就要不可避免地陷入僵局。
    社论着重指出，在中美会谈期间，中国只准备讨论由于美国干涉中国内政所引起的台湾海峡紧张局势问题。至于解决台湾问题，这是中国的内政问题，同美国无关。
    这家报纸指出，目前美国在对中国的做法上是孤立的。报纸又说，美国应该知道它自己所处的地位。
    印度尼西亚民族通讯社今天报道，就台湾海峡局势提出自己的看法的印度尼西亚国会议员们一致认为，金门和马祖是属于中国的。
