Listen, the Warriors Roar!
——Reading the Poetry Collection "Warrior's Oath"
Zang Kejia

The United States' rampant military provocations and war threats against us have enraged the 600 million Chinese people. The People's Liberation Army soldiers, who bear the sacred responsibility of defending the socialist motherland, are even more indignant and furious. The fiery verses in "Warrior's Oath" (edited by the Propaganda Department of the Political Department of the Beijing Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, published by Beijing Publishing House) will burn the U.S. imperialist paper tiger to ashes. Although this collection of warrior poems was compiled in a very short time, and is only a small part of the similar works that continue to be produced, the high patriotic enthusiasm it expresses, the righteous indignation at the provocations and threats of U.S. imperialism, and the unstoppable momentum are of typical significance. These forty-odd poems are an expression of the thoughts and feelings of all People's Liberation Army soldiers. Its voice is passionate and stirring, and its spirit is magnificent and vigorous.

The people who wrote these poems are the warriors who wield weapons to strike the enemy. Their verses are oaths, and they are also slogans for action:

	"We shout slogans in unison,
	We are ready to act at any time."

Many verses were written under such excited feelings. They expressed an intolerable anger towards the provocations and threats of the U.S. imperialism. Everyone was eager to go to the front line immediately, and the letters of determination flew like snowflakes "to the commander's headquarters," waiting only for "a command."

	"Cannons raise their heads to look at the sky,
	Tanks roar, shaking the earth,
	Military flags flutter, bayonets gleam,
	Waiting for Chairman Mao to give the order."

What a magnificent scene! And how passionate are the emotions expressed by the warriors! This emotion stems from the love for the socialist motherland, from strong confidence and a sense of justice.

Our People's Liberation Army is the people's army under the leadership of the Party, with a glorious fighting tradition. They are the defenders of the socialist cause, they are the people's heroic fighters. "The happiness of the people is our happiness, the suffering of the people is our suffering." These loyal warriors who strive for the socialist cause, seeing the unprecedented great leap forward in the motherland, and seeing that the entire people stand behind them, feel that their strength is invincible. They are fighting for the happiness of the people, for world peace, and in their hands:

	"Every shell
	Will realize the determination of 600 million people!"

Fighting for the cause of peace and justice, for the happiness of the people, is invincible, victory is in hand, and there is nothing to fear. Our warriors "are revolutionary soldiers who have been tested for a long time." In order to resist aggression, defend the motherland, and liberate their own territory, they

	"Dare to drill through a mountain of knives,
	Dare to rush into a sea of fire!"

And the aggressors they face are no longer strangers to them. The "image of American soldiers kneeling on the ground, handing over their guns and surrendering" is still "clearly remembered." These heroic warriors warn U.S. imperialism not to be rampant again, otherwise:

	"We'll fight you another 'Shangganling'!"

How magnificent are these verses! And how great is this spirit!

The warriors expressed extreme anger and contempt for Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and brutal dream of "counterattacking the mainland." The warriors compared Chiang Kai-shek to a "dying lamp," to a "puppet placed in a coffin," who still vainly tries to "compete with the sun," and "still pretends to be a fierce god." This is hateful and ridiculous. Our shelling of Jinmen is to "send a letter in advance with the shells." The great Chinese people are inviolable and invincible!

The authors in this collection of poems include combatants, demobilized soldiers, honored soldiers, and transport soldiers. Although their duties are different, their will and emotions are consistent. Please read this collection of warrior poems, please listen to the roaring voice of the warriors.

    听，战士怒吼了！
    ——读诗集“战士的誓言”
    臧克家
    美帝对我们进行猖狂的军事挑衅和战争威胁，激怒了六亿中国人民，负有保卫社会主义祖国神圣责任的解放军战士，更是义愤填胸，怒不可遏。“战士的誓言”（中国人民解放军北京部队政治部宣传部编辑、北京出版社出版）里面的火焰似的诗句，要把美帝这只纸老虎烧成灰烬。这本战士诗集虽然是在极短的时间内汇集成的，比起继续产生的同样性质的作品来还只是极小的一部分，可是它所表现出来的高度爱国主义热情，对美帝挑衅、威胁的义愤和锐不可当的气势，是有典型意义的，这四十几首诗，是所有解放军战士思想情感的表露，它的声音是激昂慷慨的，它的气魄是雄伟壮健的。
    提笔写这些诗句的人，就是手执武器打击敌人的战士。他们的诗句就是誓言，也就是行动的口号：
    “我们齐声高呼口号，
    我们时刻准备行动”。
    许多诗句是在这样激动的心情之下写出来的，他们对于美帝的挑衅和威胁表现了不能容忍的愤怒，人人摩掌擦拳，恨不得立刻走上前线，他们写的决心书雪片似的“飞向首长的司令部”，单等“一声令下”。
    “大炮昂头望苍穹，
    坦克高鸣天地动，
    军旗飘飘刺刀闪光，
    等待毛主席下命令”。这是多么雄壮的景象！表现出来的战士的情感又是多么激昂！这种情感，是从对社会主义祖国的热爱里产生出来的，是从坚强的信心和正义感里产生出来的。
    我们的解放军，是在党的领导之下的人民的军队，有着光荣的战斗传统。他们是社会主义事业的保卫者，他们是人民的英勇的战斗员。“人民的幸福就是我们的幸福，人民的苦痛就是我们的痛苦”。这些为社会主义事业而奋斗的赤心耿耿的战士，眼看到祖国空前大跃进的盛况，眼看到自己背后站立着全体人民，感到自己的力量是无敌的。自己是在为人民的幸福、为世界和平而斗争，他们手里的：
    “颗颗炮弹
    要实现六亿人民的决心！”为和平正义的事业，为人民的幸福而斗争，是无敌的，是胜利在握的，是无所畏惧的。我们的战士，“是久经考验的革命军人”，为了反抗侵略，保卫祖国，解放自己的领土，他们
    “刀山敢去钻，
    火海敢去闯！”而面临的侵略者，对于他们来说，已经不是陌生人了。“美国兵跪倒在地交枪投降的模样”还“清楚地记着”。这些英雄战士，警告美帝不要再猖狂，否则：
    “再打你一个‘上甘岭’！”这诗句多么雄壮！这气魄又是何等伟大！
    对于蒋介石卖国贼的无耻残暴“反攻大陆”梦呓，战士表现了极端的愤怒和卑视。战士把蒋介石比作“残灯”，比作“装入棺材的木偶”，还妄想“和太阳争光”，“还装得像凶神一样”，这是可恨而又可笑的。我们炮击金门，就是叫“炮弹先送个信”。伟大的中国人民是不可侮的，也是不可战胜的！
    这本诗集里的作者，有战斗员，有复员、荣誉军人，也有运输兵。职务虽然不同，他们的意志和情感却是一致的。请读一读这本战士的诗集，请听一听战士怒吼的声音。
