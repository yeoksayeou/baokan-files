Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 2nd: In Anhui, the province of thousand-jin early rice, the bumper harvest of early rice has become a great driving force for promoting the transformation of vast agricultural cooperatives into people's communes. During the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the CPC, based on the demands of the masses and the spirit of the central instructions, made preliminary plans for the work of the people's communes. The general requirement is to basically realize the communization of the entire province before this winter. The plan puts forward the slogan of doing a good job in current production to welcome the establishment of people's communes. The steps for establishing communes are: the first batch will have each county pilot several people's communes, with the pilot project ending by the end of September to gain experience. While piloting people's communes, the remaining agricultural cooperatives will organize joint cooperative committees, implement competitions, and complete the cooperative merger work before autumn planting; then, absorb the pilot experience and fully transform into people's communes. When piloting people's communes, the layout should be conducive to production and have economic centers (market towns, places with convenient transportation), breaking the boundaries of districts, townships, and counties. Regarding the scale of the people's communes, the plan requires basically one commune per township, and larger ones can reach ten to twenty thousand households based on production needs. The province's more than sixteen thousand agricultural cooperatives will be transformed into more than one thousand eight hundred people's communes. In establishing people's communes, it is necessary to emphasize ideological education through airing of views and debates, do a good job in current production, and do a good job in typical examples.
   So far, the province has piloted 322 people's communes, with 2.34 million households participating, accounting for 33% of the province's total farm households, with an average of 7,267 households per commune.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 2nd: In establishing people's communes, Sichuan Province is paying attention to closely integrating with current production to push production to a new high tide.
   Currently, all counties in the province have begun pilot work in establishing people's communes. The enthusiasm of the farmers in various places for establishing people's communes is very high. They beat gongs and drums to send application letters and letters of determination to the local leadership departments. In the pilot projects for establishing people's communes in Fuling, Peng County, Pi County, Wenjiang, Nanchong, Jintang, Suining, and other places, they have implemented putting politics in command, organizing large-scale airing of views and debates, deeply publicizing the superiority of the people's communes, and closely integrating with current production. In Suining Prefecture, each county takes two steps in establishing people's communes: first grasping workers, peasants, and soldiers, then grasping commerce and learning.
   "Do a good job in production to welcome the establishment of people's communes" has become the loudest slogan in the rural areas throughout the province. After the establishment of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Pi County, it took only two days to build a small hydropower station. Ying Township in Nanchong County mobilized some members to build water conservancy projects in advance during the establishment of the people's commune to ensure a great leap forward in agriculture. In order to ensure the completion of various tasks, the agricultural cooperatives have also organized labor armies that are both workers and peasants and also soldiers to tackle various productions. During the preparation of the People's Commune, farmers in Luxi District, Santai County, many plans between the establishment of People's Commune Township and Township, carried out a large production collaboration, organized commando teams to help the backward areas catch up with the advanced, so that the production and work between the townships development balance, a unified pace.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd: According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the Rural Work Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC held a three-day meeting of rural work ministers from various prefectural committees from August 30th to September 1st, studied the specific issues of running people's communes, and made preliminary arrangements for the pilot work of establishing people's communes.
   According to reports from various places during the meeting, the rural people have an urgent demand for running people's communes; most counties in the province had already begun the pilot work of people's communes in late August. After hearing the news of running people's communes, the masses in various places were very excited. The attendance rate of agricultural cooperatives has increased unprecedentedly; the large-scale production competitions and collaborations between cooperatives and between townships have been unfolding even more enthusiastically. People have proposed that they must strive for a bumper harvest of late rice as a gift for the transition to people's communes.

    深入宣传　大鸣大放　结合生产　典型试办
　　迎接人民公社运动高潮
    安徽、四川、广东作出规划加强领导
    据新华社合肥2日电　在早稻千斤省——安徽，早稻大丰收已经成为推动广大农业社转向人民公社的一个伟大动力。中共安徽省委在中共中央政治局扩大会议期间，根据群众的要求和中央指示的精神，对人民公社工作作了初步规划。总的要求是，在今年冬季以前，全省基本实现人民公社化。规划提出了搞好当前生产，迎接办人民公社的口号。办公社的步骤是：第一批每县试办几个人民公社，到9月底试办结束，取得经验。与试办人民公社的同时，其余农业社都要组织联社委员会，实行竞赛，并社工作在秋种前全部结束；然后吸取试办经验，全面转为人民公社。试办人民公社时，在布局方面要有利于生产，要有经济中心（集镇、交通方便的地方），打破区、乡、县的界限。关于人民公社的规模，规划要求基本上一乡一社，根据生产需要，大的也可到一两万户。全省一万六千多个农业社，将转为一千八百多个人民公社。在办人民公社中，要强调通过鸣放辩论，作好思想教育工作，搞好当前生产，搞好典型。
    到目前为止，全省已试办了三百二十二个人民公社，参加人民公社的社员有二百三十四万户，占全省总农户的33％，每个公社平均七千二百六十七户。
    据新华社成都2日电　四川省各地在建立人民公社中，注意紧密结合当前生产，把生产推向新高潮。
    目前，全省各县都已开始进行建立人民公社的试点工作。各地农民办人民公社的热情很高，他们敲锣打鼓地把申请书和决心书送到当地领导部门。涪陵、彭县、郫县、温江、南充、金堂、遂宁等地在建立人民公社的试点中，实行了政治挂帅，组织大鸣大放大辩论，深入宣传人民公社的优越性，并且紧密结合当前生产。遂宁专区各县在建立人民公社中分两步走：先抓工农兵，后抓商学。
      “搞好生产迎接人民公社建立”，已成为全省各地农村中最响亮的口号。郫县东风人民公社建社以后，仅用两天时间就修建了一座小型水电站。南充县潆乡在建立人民公社中，抽调了部分社员提前兴修水利，保证农业大跃进。为了保证各项任务的完成，各农业社还组织亦工亦农亦兵的劳动大军，突击各项生产。三台县芦溪区农民，在筹建人民公社期间，许多规划在一起建立人民公社的乡与乡之间，展开了生产大协作，组织突击队帮助生产上落后的地区迅速赶上先进的，使各乡之间的生产和工作发展平衡，步调一致。
    新华社广州2日电　中共广东省委农村工作部根据省委的指示，从8月30日到9月1日举行了为期三天的各地委农村工作部长会议，研究了办人民公社的具体问题，并对建立人民公社的试点工作作了初步的部署。
    会议中据各地汇报：农村人民群众对于办人民公社有迫切的要求；全省大多数县在8月下旬就已经着手进行人民公社试点工作。各地群众听到了办人民公社的消息以后，非常兴奋。农业社的出勤率空前提高；社与社、乡与乡之间的生产大竞赛和大协作，更是热火朝天地展开了。人们提出一定要争取晚稻大丰收，作为转入人民公社的献礼。
