Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 23rd: The editorial department of "Meng Ya" (Sprouts), a literary semi-monthly magazine sponsored by the Shanghai Branch of the Writers Association, moved into the first People's Commune in rural Shanghai – the "July 1st" People's Commune – on the 21st.

Since the rectification movement, the "Meng Ya" editorial department has changed its past practice of sitting in the office waiting for submissions, editing based solely on those submissions. They began to go deep into the masses to solicit manuscripts and guide amateur literary creation among the masses. The number of submissions from the masses has increased significantly in the publication, with the vast majority of each issue being works by workers and peasants. The editors have also promptly organized "special collections" and "special issues" that quickly reflect the current political and production struggles. Editorial staff spend two and a half days each week participating in labor at the grassroots level. However, this still could not keep up with the development of the situation. The editorial staff still couldn’t truly integrate themselves with the working masses in thought and life. After thorough discussion recently, they decided to move the editorial department to the People's Commune to share weal and woe with the broad masses of working people as ordinary laborers, participate in labor and the guidance of mass literary creation while editing the magazine, and live, labor, read literature, and run the magazine together with the peasants. This will thoroughly change the bystander attitude of "you build, I reflect." This will enable the publication to take root in the heat of the mass struggle and will be more conducive to the labor training and ideological transformation of the editorial staff.

    “萌芽”编辑部搬进人民公社
    据新华社上海23日电　作家协会上海分会主办的“萌芽”文艺半月刊的编辑部，21日搬进了上海农村的第一个人民公社——“七一”人民公社。
    整风运动以来，“萌芽”编辑部改变了过去坐在办公室里等待来稿、就稿编稿的作风，开始深入到群众中去组稿和辅导群众业余文学创作。在刊物上，群众来稿大量增加，每期绝大多数都是工农群众的作品。编辑还及时组织了迅速反映当前的政治斗争和生产斗争的“专辑”和“特辑”。编辑人员每星期抽出两个半天，到基层去参加劳动。但是仍然跟不上形势的发展，编辑人员还不能真正同劳动群众在思想上、生活上完全打成一片。最近他们经过充分讨论，决定把编辑部搬到人民公社去，以普通劳动者身份跟广大劳动人民同甘苦、共呼吸，在编好刊物的同时，参加劳动和群众文学创作的辅导工作，和农民一同生活，一同劳动，一同读文学，一同办刊物。彻底改变那种“你建设，我反映”的旁观者态度。这样做将使刊物在火热的群众斗争中扎下根，更有利于编辑人员的劳动锻炼和思想改造。
