　　College Students Give Haircuts to Farmers
　　One hot noon, Xiao Li saw a farmer wearing a "National Agricultural Implement Exhibition Visit Pass" pacing back and forth at the old site of the barbershop, looking somewhat anxious. Xiao Li asked him and learned that he was Comrade Shu Liuquan, a farmer representative from Zhongwujing Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province. He wanted to get a haircut at the barbershop because he was going to the city tomorrow to meet leaders and visit the exhibition.
　　Xiao Li pointed in the direction of the railway and said, "The barbershop has long been moved over there. Haircuts require prior registration. Would you like to get your hair cut at our class's barbershop?" Comrade Shu smiled and said, "It doesn't matter if it's far, as long as it doesn't affect your rest!" Xiao Li was afraid that Comrade Shu was worried, so he touched his own head and said, "Look! My hair was cut by our barbershop. How is it? Come to our place for a haircut. Today is Saturday, so it won't affect our rest, and we cut quickly, so it won't affect your afternoon visit." Comrade Shu finally agreed.
　　Walking into the dormitory, we saw the director of our barbershop giving a haircut to a classmate. After Xiao Li explained the purpose of their visit, the students immediately became excited. The director immediately transferred the "clippers" to Comrade Shu's head. The students gathered around this distant relative, chatting and laughing. They told Comrade Shu, "Our school is marching towards communism. From next semester on, we will be half-work and half-study. Each of us will not only become a college student who is both red and expert, but also an ordinary, versatile worker!" Comrade Shu smiled and said, "Great! We are all working hard, and communism is coming soon."

　　大学生给农民理发
    一个炎热的中午，小李看见一位胸前佩戴着“全国农具展览会参观证”的农民，在理发社的旧址踱来踱去，似乎有些焦急的样子。小李一问，原来他是山西省平顺县中五井乡的农民代表舒刘全同志，因为明天要进城去见首长和参观，想找理发社理理发。
    小李指着铁路的方向说：“理发社早已搬到那边去了，理发需要事先登记，请您到我们班的理发社去剪好吗？”舒同志笑着说：“远些没关系，不要影响你们的休息！”小李恐怕舒同志不放心，就摸着自己的头说：“看！我的头就是我们理发社理的，怎么样？到我们那儿去理吧，今天是星期六不会影响我们休息，而且我们理得很快也不会影响您下午参观。”舒同志终于答应了。
    走进宿舍，我们理发社社主任正在给一个同学理着呢，小李说明来意后，同学们立刻沸腾起来。社主任立刻把“推子”转移到舒同志的头上。同学们围着这位远方的亲人谈笑风生，你一言我一语告诉舒同志：“我们学校要向共产主义进军了，从下学期开始就半工半读，我们每个人都不仅要成为一个又红又专的大学生，而且要成为一个普通的多才多艺的工人！”舒同志笑着说，“好啊！我们都鼓足干劲，共产主义就快要到来了。”
