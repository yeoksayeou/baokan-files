Iceland's Right to Determine Territorial Waters Cannot Be Interfered With
By a commentator from this newspaper

    The Icelandic government's decision to expand its territorial waters from four nautical miles to twelve nautical miles came into effect on September 1st. However, upon hearing the news, Britain has dispatched warships to escort three teams of British fishing vessels to enter Iceland's newly defined territorial waters for fishing in a planned manner. People cannot but pay close attention to the British government's brazenly provocative behavior towards Iceland.

    As is well known, fishing is the mainstay of Iceland's national economy; 97% of Iceland's exports are fish products. However, due to the predatory fishing by foreign fishing vessels, especially British fishing vessels, in Icelandic fishing areas, Iceland's economy has suffered greatly. If Iceland does not take measures to protect fish stocks near its territorial waters, the livelihood of the Icelandic people will be seriously threatened. Therefore, reasonably expanding the scope of territorial waters and prohibiting foreign fishing vessels from plundering fish stocks has become an urgent demand of the Icelandic people.

    As early as the Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea held in February-April this year and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council held in Copenhagen in May, the Icelandic government raised the issue of expanding Iceland's territorial waters from four nautical miles to twelve nautical miles, but due to the obstruction of the United States and Britain, the issue was not resolved. Britain brazenly sent a note to the Icelandic government on June 4, openly denying Iceland's right to expand its territorial waters, and threatened to "prevent" any so-called "illegal interference attempts" against British fishing vessels entering Icelandic territorial waters for fishing.

    Although the United States did not adopt the openly threatening attitude of Britain, it also played an extremely disgraceful role and used more vicious and insidious means. It used both hard and soft tactics from both inside and outside to force Iceland to submit. Within Iceland, the United States created the Icelandic government crisis that occurred in May and June, plotting to subvert the Icelandic government. At the Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea and the Copenhagen North Atlantic Group Council, the United States also carried out various activities in an attempt to soften and isolate Iceland. For example, the United States directed Denmark to propose convening a North Atlantic regional conference excluding the Soviet Union to discuss the issue of Icelandic territorial waters in order to unite the relevant countries in the region to put pressure on Iceland.

    However, neither the shameless threats of British imperialism nor the vicious plots of American imperialism can shake the Icelandic people's determination to safeguard national sovereignty. With the unanimous support of the people of the whole country, the Icelandic government overcame the government crisis, refused to convene the North Atlantic regional conference, and resolutely announced on June 30 that it would formally expand the scope of its territorial waters to twelve nautical miles, effective from September 1. The American and British imperialists, who attempted to deprive small countries of the right to exercise independent sovereignty, suffered a shameful defeat!

    Regarding the issue of territorial waters, according to the principles of international law, each country has the right to determine the width of its territorial waters based on its own specific circumstances. The existing widths of territorial waters vary from country to country, with the general standard being from three to twelve nautical miles. At present, countries that have announced a width of twelve nautical miles include the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Guatemala, Colombia, and Ecuador. Iceland naturally has its inherent right to stipulate that the width of its territorial waters is twelve nautical miles. What right do the American and British imperialists have to interfere arbitrarily!

    The events of American and British imperialism interfering in other countries' regulations on the scope of territorial waters have been repeatedly seen. Each time, they use the excuse of taking care of the interests of international navigation to advocate maintaining a width of three nautical miles and oppose expansion, especially resolutely oppose expansion to twelve nautical miles. Anyone with clear eyes can see that the reason why American and British imperialism resolutely opposes other countries expanding the scope of their territorial waters is by no means from the so-called consideration of the interests of international navigation, but from the perspective of facilitating aggression and plundering marine resources. However, the era when imperialism decided everything is gone forever. The autonomous right of all countries to stipulate the width of their territorial waters is not allowed to be interfered with by imperialism. American and British imperialism cannot stop Iceland from reasonably expanding the scope of its territorial waters today, and it will not be able to stop any country from reasonably expanding the scope of its territorial waters in the future!

    Iceland's action to reasonably expand the scope of its territorial waters has been supported by many countries. The Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic and other countries have formally announced their respect for the Icelandic government's decision to expand the scope of its territorial waters. Now, British imperialism is attempting to use force to undermine Iceland's sovereignty, which is not allowed. The Chinese people, together with the people of all countries, support the reasonable actions of the Icelandic people and government, and resolutely oppose the shameless interference of American and British imperialism in Iceland!

　　冰岛决定领海范围的权利不容干涉
　　本报评论员
    冰岛政府关于将本国领海范围从四浬扩大为十二浬的决定，已在9月1日生效。但是，消息传来，英国已经派遣军舰护送三队英国渔船，有计划地开入冰岛新规定的领海范围捕鱼。对于英国政府这种肆无忌惮地向冰岛公开挑衅的行为，人们不能不予以密切的注意。
    众所周知，渔业是冰岛国民经济的主体；冰岛输出的97％都是鱼产品。但是，由于外国渔船特别是英国渔船任意在冰岛捕鱼区进行掠夺式的捕鱼，使得冰岛经济遭受了极大的损害。冰岛如果不采取措施来保护领海附近的鱼产，冰岛人民的生计将受到严重威胁。因此合理地扩大领海范围，禁止外国渔船掠夺鱼产，就成为冰岛人民一项迫切的要求。
    早在今年2月至4月的日内瓦举行的海上法会议和5月间哥本哈根北大西洋公约组织理事会上，冰岛政府就提出了把冰岛领海范围从四浬扩大到十二浬的问题，但是由于美国和英国的阻挠，问题没有得到解决。英国更是猖狂地于6月4日照会冰岛政府，公然否认冰岛有扩大领海范围的权利，并且扬言将“制止”对侵入冰岛领海捕鱼的英国渔船的所谓“任何非法干涉企图”。
    美国虽然没有采取英国那种公开威胁的态度，但是也扮演了极其不光彩的角色，使用了更加毒辣的阴险手段。它从内外两个方面双管齐下，软硬兼施，以迫使冰岛屈服。在冰岛内部，美国制造了5、6月间一度出现的冰岛政府危机，阴谋颠复冰岛政府。在日内瓦的海上法会议和哥本哈根北大西洋集团理事会上，美国也进行了种种活动企图软化和孤立冰岛。譬如，美国指使丹麦建议召开排斥苏联参加的北大西洋地区会议，讨论冰岛领海问题，以便联合该地区的有关国家对冰岛施加压力。
    然而，无论是英帝国主义的无耻威胁，也无论是美帝国主义的毒辣阴谋，都动摇不了冰岛人民维护国家主权的决心。冰岛政府在全国人民的一致支持下，克服了政府危机，拒绝召开北大西洋地区会议，毅然决然地在6月30日正式宣布扩大领海范围至十二浬，自9月1日起生效。企图剥夺小国行使独立主权的权利的美英帝国主义，遭受了可耻的失败！
    关于领海问题，根据国际法原则，各国有权根据自己的具体情况决定自己的领海宽度。各国现有的领海宽度不一，一般的标准是自三浬至十二浬。目前宣布十二浬宽度的已有苏联、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、危地马拉、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔等国。冰岛自然也有它的固有权利规定自己的领海宽度为十二浬，美英帝国主义凭什么权利横加干涉！
    美英帝国主义干涉他国规定领海范围的事件，已屡见不鲜，每一次都借口要照顾国际航海的利益主张维持三浬的宽度，反对扩展，尤其是坚决反对扩展到十二浬。任何明眼人都看得出，美英帝国主义所以坚决反对他国扩展领海范围，绝不是从所谓照顾国际航海利益出发，而是从便于侵略、便于掠夺海洋资源出发的。然而，由帝国主义决定一切的时代已经一去不复返了。各国规定自己的领海宽度的自主权利是不容帝国主义干涉的。美英帝国主义今天拦不住冰岛合理地扩展领海范围，今后也拦不住任何国家合理地扩展自己的领海范围！
    冰岛合理地扩展领海范围的行动，已得到许多国家的支持。苏联和德意志民主共和国等国都已正式宣布尊重冰岛政府扩展领海范围的决定。现在，英帝国主义正企图用武力来破坏冰岛的主权，这是不能容许的。中国人民和各国人民一道，支持冰岛人民和政府的合理行动，坚决反对美英帝国主义对冰岛的无耻干涉！
