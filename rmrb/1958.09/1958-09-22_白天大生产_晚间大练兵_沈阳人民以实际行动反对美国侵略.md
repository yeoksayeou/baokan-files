Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 21st: People from all walks of life in Shenyang gathered today to resolutely support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and angrily condemn Dulles' absurd remarks attempting to further expand aggression against our country.

    Thousands of workers at the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant held meetings this morning after hearing Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement on the radio, protesting Dulles' absurd remarks while simultaneously boosting production to support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement with practical actions. Technician Zhao Hanliang and worker Chai Yushui said that anyone with a clear mind knows that Jinmen (Quemoy), Matsu, and Taiwan have been Chinese territory since ancient times, and liberating these places is entirely China's internal affair. Dulles' shameless lies are a slander against the 600 million Chinese people. Workers in the steelmaking workshop of this factory were even more motivated after hearing Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement and decided to overproduce 200 tons of steel by the end of the month to strike back at the American aggressors. More than 1,700 employees of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant held separate meetings. Wang Wenshan, a deputy to the National People's Congress and a well-known model worker in Shenyang, said that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement expressed the firm will of the 600 million people of the country. If American imperialism disregards the warnings of the Chinese people, we have the strength to drive it out of China's territory. The factory's employees guaranteed to overfulfill the September Great Leap Forward plan to severely strike the aggressors.

    Members of the people's communes in the suburbs of Shenyang also held separate meetings. Han Rensong, a model agricultural laborer in the city, warned Dulles and Eisenhower that playing with atomic weapons will not scare us. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and peace-loving countries and people all over the world are supporting us. In order to liberate Jinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan as soon as possible, our entire commune has launched a mass arming campaign, engaging in great production during the day and large-scale military training in the evening, ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time.

    All commanders and fighters of the Red Flag Militia Regiment of Liaoning University and the Red Flag Militia Division of Shenyang Agricultural College gathered today to pledge to contribute all their strength to the liberation of Jinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan. More than 200 militia fighters from Liaoning University held a demonstration parade after the swearing-in ceremony.

    The vast numbers of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shenyang held protest meetings today. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Wang Zhao said that if American imperialism disregards the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and dares to impose war on the Chinese people, we are determined to bury American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait.
