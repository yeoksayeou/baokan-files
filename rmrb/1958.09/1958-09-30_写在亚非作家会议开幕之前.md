　　The Asian-African Writers' Conference is about to open in Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. As a Chinese writer, I wholeheartedly congratulate the conference on its success, and I am willing to dedicate my strength to this conference. Writers from more than fifty countries in Asia and Africa are sitting down in one hall, exchanging opinions cordially and frankly, talking happily about friendship, talking about peace, talking about the development of our literary careers, talking about the brilliant future of our literature, encouraging each other, learning from each other, exchanging experiences, introducing situations, so that we can have a deeper understanding and a deeper trust of each other—thinking of this scene, thinking of the unprecedented grand occasion of this conference, I feel extremely excited.

　　Writers from more than fifty countries have traveled a long way to the beautiful city of Tashkent, where the sun is warm and the sky is clear. When writers are talking heart-to-heart in a friendly atmosphere, they will certainly not forget that the eyes of the readers are also watching the venue. Readers from more than fifty countries are eagerly looking forward to the achievements of the conference. Writers write for readers, so they also have a responsibility to speak for readers. The people of Asian and African countries have either suffered enough from exploitation and trampling, or are working hard to get rid of the shackles of colonialism; the economic lifelines of some countries are still in the hands of foreigners; some countries are still suffering from foreign cultural aggression; some countries still have foreign troops or foreign military bases; in some countries, people are still living a painful life under the whip of the colonialists. The shadow of colonialism still hangs over the awakened Asia and Africa, and even in countries that have already achieved independence, colonialists are constantly engaged in conspiracies of restoration. If you casually ask a reader from an Asian or African country: who is the enemy of his country? His answer must be "colonialists." Because he has seen with his own eyes who has robbed them of their wealth, who has made them suffer for a long time, and who is running rampant in their country. Even a Lebanese child is shouting to drive the American troops out. The people of Asian and African countries deeply know that in order to strive for their own independence and happiness, they must eliminate colonialism. Colonialism is the plague that has raged in Asia and Africa for many years. Eradicating the plague is the common desire of the people of Asian and African countries.

　　In the literature of our Asian and African countries, on the one hand, it is full of painful moans and profound accusations, and on the other hand, it is also full of fighting calls and confidence in victory. Some Asian and African people have stood up strongly, and some Asian and African countries have shown a powerful force that makes colonialists tremble. Our literature has also radiated a new and dazzling brilliance.

　　Our literary cause is growing among the people. Even the most talented writer must breathe together and share the joys and sorrows with his people. The aspirations of the people will certainly be reflected in the literature. The writers have traveled such a long way, not to talk about a little personal trivial matter: each writer has come to Tashkent with the hearts of countless readers. Everyone is here to find a common language, a common path, hoping to promote the realization of the common aspirations of the people of Asia and Africa through the development of literature, through unity and cooperation.

　　This conference will surely be a great success. The close and friendly unity of Asian and African writers will surely strengthen the unity of the people of the two continents. The development and prosperity of our literary cause are inseparable from the independence and happiness of the people of the two continents. All this can only be achieved after the plague of colonialism is completely eradicated. Therefore, our common language is the language of unity, and our common path is the path of anti-colonialism. The Asian-African Writers' Conference will surely realize the common aspirations of the people of Asia and Africa.

    写在亚非作家会议开幕之前
    巴金
    亚非作家会议就要在苏联乌兹别克共和国首都塔什干开幕了。作为中国的作家，我万分热诚地祝贺会议的成功，我愿意为这个会议献出我的力量。亚洲和非洲五十多个国家的作家们在一个厅堂里坐下来，亲切地、坦白地交换意见，畅快地谈友谊，谈和平，谈我们文学事业的发展，谈论我们文学的光辉的前途，互相鼓励，互相学习，交流经验，介绍情况，让我们对彼此都有更深的了解，也有更深的信任——想到这个场面，想到这次会议的空前盛况，我感到无比的兴奋。
    五十多个国家的作家们走过长远的路程，来到日暖天青的美丽城市塔什干。作家们在友好的气氛中毫无顾忌地谈着自己心里话的时候，一定不会忘记读者们的眼睛也在注视会场。五十多个国家的读者热烈地期待着会议的成就。作家们为读者写作，因此也有责任为读者讲话。亚非国家的人民有的过去受够了剥削和践踏，有的正在努力摆脱殖民主义的枷锁；有的国家经济命脉还捏在外人的手里；有的国家还受着外国的文化侵略；有的国家里还有外国军队或者外国的军事基地；有的国家里，人民还在殖民主的皮鞭下过痛苦日子。殖民主义的阴影至今还笼罩在觉醒了的亚洲和非洲的上空，甚至在已经取得独立的国家中，殖民主义者还不断地在搞复辟的阴谋。倘使随便问一位亚非国家的读者：谁是他国家的敌人。他的回答一定是“殖民主义者”。因为他亲眼看见什么人抢走了他们的财富，什么人使他们长期受苦，什么人在他们的国家里横行。连一个黎巴嫩小孩也嚷着要把美国军队赶出去。亚非国家的人民深切地知道要争取自己的独立和幸福，就得消灭殖民主义。殖民主义是亚非两洲猖獗了多年的瘟疫。扑灭瘟疫是亚非国家人民共同的愿望。
    我们亚非国家的文学中，一方面充满了痛苦的呻吟和沉痛的控诉，另一方面也充满了战斗的呼声和胜利的信心。一部分亚非人民已经坚强地站了起来，一部分亚非国家已经显示了使殖民主义者战栗不安的强大力量。我们的文学里也放射了新的夺目的光辉。
    我们的文学事业是在人民中间生长的。即使是最有天才的作家，也必须和他的人民共呼吸，同甘苦。人民的愿望一定会在文学中得到反映。作家们走了那么远的路程，并不是为了讲一点个人的琐事：每个作家都带着无数读者的心来到塔什干。大家到这里来寻找一种共同的语言，一条共同的道路，希望通过文学的发展，通过团结与合作来促使实现亚非两洲人民共同的愿望。
    这次会议一定会得到很大的成功。亚非作家的紧密、友好的团结一定会加强两洲人民的团结。我们文学事业的发展和繁荣是跟两洲人民的独立和幸福分不开的。这一切只有在殖民主义的瘟疫完全扑灭之后才能够实现。因此我们的共同的语言就是团结的语言，我们共同的道路就是反殖民主义的道路。亚非作家会议一定会实现亚非两洲人民共同的愿望。
