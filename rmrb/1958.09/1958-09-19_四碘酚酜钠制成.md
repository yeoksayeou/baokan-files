Sodium Tetraiodophenolphthalein Successfully Produced

    The pharmacy of the affiliated hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical College has successfully trial-produced sodium tetraiodophenolphthalein. In the past, our hospital used British products, which were expensive and of poor quality, costing about 25 yuan per dose. The self-made product now costs only about 2.6 yuan, and can also save foreign exchange for the country. The trial product has been identified by the Inner Mongolia Health Department Drug Inspection Institute as meeting the pharmacopoeia regulations. The Pharmacology Teaching and Research Group of our hospital has carried out toxicity observations and clinical applications in the radiology department, and all believe that the efficacy is good. The pharmacy is now continuing to research contrast agents, striving to eliminate the need for imported goods within six months.

    四碘酚酜钠制成
    内蒙古医学院附属医院药房试制四碘酚酜钠成功。过去我院用的都是英国货，价高质劣，用一个剂量就需二十五元左右。现在自制的只要两角六左右，还可以给国家节省外汇。试制品经内蒙古卫生厅药检所鉴定合乎药典规定，经我院药理教研组作毒性观察及放射线科临床应用，都认为效能良好。现在药房正在继续作造影剂的研究，争取在半年内不用舶来品。内蒙古医学院附属医院　路德修
