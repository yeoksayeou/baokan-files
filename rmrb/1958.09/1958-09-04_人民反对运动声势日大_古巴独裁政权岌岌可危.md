Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd dispatch. TASS, New York, September 2nd: News from Cuba indicates that the tyrannical rule of the dictator Batista is becoming increasingly unstable, and domestic opposition movements are constantly growing.

    "America Daily," published in Miami, Florida, printed a message from its Havana correspondent, quoting a leader of the Cuban opposition who said that in Cuba, "the decisive battle is coming. Batista is trying to isolate Cuba from the outside world so that the whole world will not know the crimes committed by his regime every day… In the arbitrary abuse of power, the Batista government is preparing for the presidential election with extremely blatant violent actions, and the people are either indifferent or angry about this election. In just one week, more than forty people with various political views were killed on the streets of Havana under the orders of Police Chief Garcia." This conversation went on to say that despite this, the liberation movement in Cuba is constantly strengthening.

　　人民反对运动声势日大
　　古巴独裁政权岌岌可危
    据新华社3日讯　据塔斯社纽约2日讯：来自古巴的消息说，巴蒂斯塔独裁者的暴虐统治地位已经越来越不巩固，国内的反对运动正在不断增长。
    在佛罗里达州迈阿密出版的“美洲日报”刊登了它驻哈瓦那记者发来的消息，引述古巴一个反对派领袖的谈话说，在古巴，“决定性的战斗即将到来。巴蒂斯塔企图使古巴和外界隔绝，以便不让全世界知道他的政权每天犯下的罪行……在肆意滥用职权的情况下，巴蒂斯塔政府以极为露骨的暴力行动准备总统选举，而人民对这种选举不是冷漠就是愤怒。只在一个星期里就有四十多名具有各种政治观点的人在警察局长加尔西阿的命令下在哈瓦那街头被杀害。”这篇谈话接着说，但是尽管如此，古巴国内的解放运动仍在不断加强。
