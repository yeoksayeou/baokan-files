    Seize Steel with Iron Will
    15,000 Teachers and Students from Taiyuan's Universities and Middle Schools Head to the Steel Front

    (Reported by our newspaper) "Let steel furnaces and iron furnaces become forests, let molten steel and molten iron become oceans." With such grand aspirations, the steel army of 15,000 teachers and students from Taiyuan's universities and middle schools set off on the 22nd to the steel front lines of Hekou, Wangfeng, Huaketo, Yangjiayu, and Jinci.

    When the motherland issued the call for nationwide steelmaking, and Premier Zhou and Foreign Minister Chen made statements regarding the Taiwan issue, teachers and students from schools like Taiyuan Institute of Technology, Shanxi Medical College, and Shanxi Normal College expressed: they were determined to contribute everything to the liberation of Taiwan and the fight against US imperialist military provocations, and requested the schools to approve their immediate participation in the battle at the steel front. Teachers and students expressed their determination to fight through big-character posters and letters of resolution. The steel combat camp composed of teachers and students from Shanxi Provincial Art School stated: "We are a young steel combat camp, cultural vanguards striving for both redness and expertise. In order to build socialism and combat the war provocations of US imperialism, we are determined to go to the steel front!" More than 700 students from the Metallurgical Industry School, in high spirits, led by Wang Zhendong, the secretary of the Party General Branch, went to the Hekou area. Their battle slogan was: "If the marshal does not ascend the platform, the iron ore digging will not stop; if the ‘satellite’ does not go into the sky, we will never leave the mining area!" More than 100 teachers and students from Shanxi Medical College and more than 500 teachers and students from Taiyuan Medical College formed a medical team and arrived at various construction sites, working, learning, and providing care at the same time. They also resolved to transform their thinking in mining and iron smelting, adhere to teaching, actively study the problems discovered in practice, and make teaching and hygiene science truly serve production.

    This army has an iron will, and no difficulty can stop them. More than 1,000 teachers and students from Taiyuan Institute of Technology, carrying their luggage, marched more than 130 li to Hekou, and no one complained. All the students of the seventh battalion of Taiyuan No. 2 Middle School, who were supporting Jinyuan Commune in iron smelting, were in high spirits after receiving their tasks, expressing their determination to speed up and complete the task. The Deng Yubao group of eight students from Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company Technical School built a 17.75 cubic meter native furnace in just eight hours. The mining school brigade has collected more than 2,000 tons of ore.

    As early as the end of August and the beginning of September, before this army set off, many teachers and students from Taiyuan's universities and middle schools had successively gone to Xishan to build roads and mine, and they had all successfully completed their tasks. More than 270 people from the Medical College mined 232 tons of ore from September 4th to 16th, almost exceeding the original task of 160 tons by half.

    At present, a small number of teachers and students remaining in the schools of the city, with soaring enthusiasm, are also engaged in activities such as burning refractory bricks to support the steel front, while vigorously making steel.

    用钢铁意志夺取钢铁
    太原一万五千大中学校师生开赴钢铁前线
    本报讯  “让钢炉铁炉成林，让钢水铁水成洋”，太原市各大、中学校师生组成的拥有一万五千人的钢铁大军，抱着这样的宏愿，于22日分别奔上了河口、王封、化客头、杨家峪、晋祠等钢铁前线。
    当祖国发出了全民炼钢的召唤，以及周总理和陈外长关于台湾问题的声明发表后，太原工学院、山西医学院、山西师范学院等学校的师生都纷纷表示：决心为解放台湾和打击美帝国主义军事挑衅而贡献一切，并请求学校批准他们立即到钢铁前线参加战斗。师生们都用大字报、决心书表示了自己的战斗决心。山西省艺术学校师生组成的钢铁战斗营表示：“我们是年青的钢铁战斗营，是迈向又红又专的文化尖兵，为了建设社会主义，打击美帝国主义的战争挑衅，我们要坚决走向钢铁前线！”冶金工业学校七百余人，情绪昂扬，由党总支书记王振东亲自率领，开往河口地区，他们的战斗口号是：“元帅不升帐，挖铁不停止，‘卫星’不上天，绝不离矿区！”山西医学院一百多名师生和太原市医学院五百多名师生组成了医疗大队，分别到达各个工地，边劳动，边学习，边护理。他们并决心在采矿炼铁中改造思想，坚持教学，积极研究从实际中发现的问题，使教学和卫生科学真正服务于生产。
    这支大军具有钢铁般的意志，任何困难都挡不住他们。太原工学院一千多师生，背着行李急行一百三十多里到达河口，谁也不叫苦。太原二中支援晋源公社炼铁的第七营全体同学，接受任务后，斗志昂扬，表示要快马加鞭完成任务。太原钢铁公司技术学校的邓雨保小组八名同学，八小时就建成了一座十七点七五立方公尺的土方炉。采矿学校大队已采集矿石两千多吨。
    早在8月底9月初，在这支大军出发之前，太原市各大、中学校不少师生就曾陆续到西山修路、挖矿，他们都已胜利地完成了任务。医学院二百七十多人从9月4日到16日，挖矿石二百三十二吨，几乎超过原定任务一百六十吨的一半。
    目前，全市各大、中学少部分留校师生，也以冲天干劲，一面大搞钢铁，一面从事其他如烧耐火砖等活动，支援钢铁前线。
