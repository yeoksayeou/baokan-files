Culture Goes to the Mountains, Technology Goes to the Mountains, Labor Force Goes to the Mountains
    Leshan Prefecture Establishes Schools in Mountain Areas
    (Our Newspaper News, Reporters Fang Shi and Zhu Shi report) Sichuan Province's Leshan Prefecture has been running a new type of industry and agriculture middle school in remote mountain areas since April of this year. These schools recruit students from cities and areas with relatively developed culture and abundant labor, and establish the schools in mountainous areas lacking culture and labor. After graduation, students participate in local industrial and agricultural production, thus bringing culture to the mountains, technology to the mountains, and labor to the mountains. Building these schools plays a significant role in accelerating the development of industry and agriculture in mountainous areas and changing the face of these areas.
    Currently, such schools have been established in the remote mountainous areas of Emei, Hongya, and Qianwei counties in Leshan Prefecture.
    The students of these industry and agriculture middle schools mostly come from other places or county towns and market towns within the county. We visited an industry and agriculture middle school run by Emei County. This school is built in a mountainous area more than seventy miles away from Emei County, and most of the students are graduates of senior primary schools in the county seat. The students are generally between sixteen and twenty years old, and they can undertake a certain amount of industrial and agricultural production labor. The school curriculum includes politics, language, mathematics, and industrial and agricultural production knowledge. The Emei school also offers basic knowledge of physics and chemistry. Students participate in the labor of nearby factories and mines and cooperatives, and cadres from factories and mines and agricultural technology stations are invited to teach industrial and agricultural production knowledge courses. The knowledge students learn is very closely integrated with the actual situation of local industrial and agricultural production. Wan Yongze, a student at the Emei Industry and Agriculture Middle School, told reporters: After graduating in three years, we can smelt steel in industry and work in the fields in agriculture. When industry needs us, we can be workers; when agriculture needs us, we can be farmers.
    These schools are built by students running the schools, labor building the schools, mass support, and leadership from the Party committees and governments. All students implement a half-work, half-study system, pay their own way to study, and do not require the government to spend a single penny. Local Party and government leading organs only provide organizational leadership in terms of principles, policies, political ideology, and educational content, and mobilize the workers and peasants to actively support and help them in terms of housing, utensils, and labor knowledge.
    Due to the implementation of half-work, half-study and labor to build the school, the income of students has gradually increased, and some can be self-sufficient. The students' labor income is distributed according to the principles of labor building the school, payment according to work, and mutual assistance among students. At present, the public accumulation of the Emei Industry and Agriculture Middle School has reached more than 600 yuan. Among the 100 students in the school, 30% of the students' distributed income can already be self-sufficient.
    After several months of labor training and political and cultural study, the ideological awareness of the vast majority of students has been greatly improved. They work enthusiastically, study hard, and their academic performance is also constantly improving. The average score in the entrance examination for the Emei school was 55 points, and the average score in the July test reached 70 points. The students have developed a sense of loving the school as their home, and many students are prepared to bring their relatives to the mountainous areas to settle down and participate in the labor construction of the mountainous areas for a long time.
    Now, these schools have established a very high prestige among the masses, and many parents are clamoring to send their children to these schools. Parents have summarized that these schools have four major advantages: First, schools are located in mountainous areas, supporting the economic construction of the mountainous areas; second, they exercise their children's bodies and learn cultural knowledge and production technology; third, students work and study part-time, becoming self-sufficient, reducing the economic burden on families; fourth, because students live collective labor lives and study lives, they cultivate students' good moral character and solve the problem of children's education.
    Run More Schools in Mountain Areas
  　Shuang Shi
    The CCP Leshan Prefectural Committee in Sichuan Province is taking an important step in developing mountainous areas by establishing industry and agriculture middle schools. The schools run by the Leshan Prefectural Committee are a new form of private agricultural middle school, and a new development of agricultural middle schools. It is worth popularizing them widely in mountainous areas.
    This kind of vocational school not only meets the schooling requirements of urban senior primary school graduates, but also has the important significance of bringing culture to the mountains, technology to the mountains, and labor to the mountains. It will accelerate the development of industry and agriculture in mountainous areas and change the backward face of these areas. Our country has vast and expansive mountainous areas, extremely rich underground resources, and agricultural production also has great potential. However, these areas are generally the places with the most lack of culture, technology, and labor. If these kinds of industry and agriculture middle schools are widely established in mountainous areas, it will play a huge supporting role in the economic construction of mountainous areas.
    This kind of school teaches students agricultural knowledge and industrial knowledge; students participate in agricultural labor and industrial labor during their studies. This facilitates the cultivation of students into all-rounders who are both workers and farmers. After graduation, students can participate in agricultural production and industrial production; they can be farmers when agriculture needs them, and workers when industry needs them.
    Students at this school leave the environment of rural areas and cities and go to the arduous mountainous areas for collective study and collective labor. This makes it easy to cultivate students' labor habits, collectivist spirit, and ability to manage their own lives. It also makes it easy to cultivate students' socialist moral character.
    To accelerate the development of mountainous areas and comprehensively utilize mountainous areas, we must learn from the good experience of the Leshan Prefectural Committee.
　　Henan's First Women's University
    (Our Newspaper News) Under the leadership of Zheng Fengying, the female director of the Leicun Cooperative in Wencun Township, Dengfeng County, Henan Province, the province's first women's university was established.
    The school's academic committee is made up of seven people from the township's women's federation and resident cooperative cadres. Township and cooperative cadres donated more than 30 yuan to purchase books and paper. The township club also donated more than 100 agricultural technology and primary school textbooks and other books. So, the cooperative did not spend a single penny to start the women's university.
    The learning content is divided into politics, basic women's knowledge, maternal and child hygiene, agricultural technology, language and other subjects.
　　Anshan Iron and Steel Institute Established
    (Xinhua News Agency) Anshan Iron and Steel Institute, the first institution of higher learning in the steel capital of Anshan, was established in early September.
    This new type of four-year university was formed by merging the original Anshan Spare Time University, Anshan No. 2 Iron and Steel Industry School, Anshan Spare Time Iron and Steel School, Anshan Veteran Cadre Cultural Remedial School, and the Correspondence Department of Northeast Institute of Technology. According to the needs of the country, it has two departments: mining and metallurgy and mechanical and electrical engineering, including five majors: mining, smelting, rolling steel, mechanical equipment for metallurgical factories, and electrification of industrial enterprises. In order to cultivate urgently needed talents in various aspects of the iron and steel industry more quickly and in greater numbers, the school also has a university night school department, a secondary technical class and a secondary technical night school department, a workers' class, and a correspondence department. The college now has more than 2,000 students and faculty members.
    Yuan Zhen, manager of Anshan Iron and Steel, serves concurrently as the president of the college. He pointed out at the college's founding meeting that the task of this school is to cultivate construction talents who have both socialist consciousness and iron and steel technical knowledge, in accordance with the principle that education must be combined with productive labor. Students should spend a quarter of their time participating in labor during their studies.

### 用各种各样的办法  办各种各样的学校

　　用各种各样的办法  办各种各样的学校
    文化上山　技术上山　劳动力上山
　　乐山专区把学校办在山区
    本报讯　记者方实、朱实报道：四川省乐山专区从今年4月份起在边远山区举办了一种新型的工农业中学。这种学校从城市和文化比较发达、劳动力比较多的地区招生，把学校办在文化和劳动力缺乏的山区，学生毕业后就地参加工农业生产，这样，就使文化上山、技术上山、劳动力上山。建设这种学校对于加速山区工农业的发展，改变山区面貌有很大作用。
    目前，这种学校已经在乐山专区的峨眉、洪雅、犍为等县的边远山区各办了一所。
    这种工农业中学的学生，绝大多数来自外地或本县的县城集镇。我们访问了峨眉县办的一所工农业中学，这所学校建在距峨眉县城七十余里的山区里，学生多数是这个县城关的往届高小毕业生。学生年龄一般是十六岁到二十岁，他们都能担负一定的工农业生产劳动。学校课程有政治、语文、数学和工农业生产知识等，峨眉这所学校还设有理化常识。学生一面参加邻近厂矿、合作社的劳动，一面请厂矿和农业技术站的干部教授工农业生产知识课。学生学习到的知识和当地工农业生产的实际结合得非常密切。峨眉工农业中学的学生万永泽告诉记者：我们三年毕业后，搞工业可以炼钢，搞农业可以下地，工业需要时当工人，农业需要时当农民。
    这种学校是采用学生办学，劳动建校，群众支援，党委和政府领导的办法兴建起来的。学生全部实行半工半读，自费求学，不要政府花一个钱，当地党政领导机关只是在方针、政策、政治思想、教育内容等方面加以组织领导，并发动工农群众在住房、用具和劳动知识方面积极支援和帮助他们。
    由于实行半工半读、劳动建校，学生的收入逐步增加，有的可以自给自足。学生的劳动所得，根据劳动建校、按劳取酬、同学之间互助的原则进行分配。现在，峨眉工农业中学的公共积累已达六百多元，全校一百人中，有30％的学生分配所得已能自给自足。
    经过几个月的劳动锻炼和政治文化的学习，绝大多数学生的思想觉悟有了很大提高。他们热情劳动，努力学习，学习成绩也不断提高。峨眉学校入学考试时平均分数是五十五分，7月份测验平均达到七十分。学生们已经养成了爱校如家的思想，有不少学生已准备接自己亲人到山区来安家落户，长期参加山区的劳动建设。
    现在，这几所学校已经在群众中树立了很高的威信，许多家长都纷纷要求把子弟送进这种学校。家长们总结了这种学校有四大好处：第一，学校设在山区，支援了山区的经济建设；第二，锻炼了子弟的身体，学习了文化知识和生产技术；第三，学生半工半读，自给自足，减轻了家庭经济负担；第四，由于学生过着集体的劳动生活和学习生活，培养了学生良好的道德品质，解决了子弟的受教育问题。
    多在山区办学
  　双实
    中共四川省乐山地委在山区举办工农业中学，是开发山区的重要步骤。乐山地委举办的这种学校，是民办农业中学的一种新的形式，是农业中学的新发展，很值得在山区普遍推广。
    这种职业学校，它不仅满足了城市高小毕业生的升学要求，同时它还具有使文化上山、技术上山、劳动上山的重要意义，它将加速山区工农业的发展，改变山区落后的面貌。我国有广大辽阔的山区，地下资源极其丰富，农业生产也具有很大潜力，但是这些地区一般都是文化、技术、劳动力最缺乏的地方，如果山区都广泛办起这种工农业中学，这对山区经济建设将会起巨大的支援作用。
    这种学校既教给学生农业知识，又教给学生以工业知识；学生在学习期间，既参加农业劳动，也参加工业劳动，这样便于培养学生成为一个亦工亦农的多面手。学生毕业后，既可参加农业生产，又可参加工业生产；在农业需要时当农民，在工业需要时当工人。
    这种学校学生都离开农村和城市的环境，到艰苦的山区去，集体学习集体劳动。这样就便于锻炼学生的劳动习惯、集体主义精神和自己管理生活的能力，也容易培养起学生社会主义的道德品质。
    要加速开发山区，综合利用山区，就必须学习乐山地委的好经验。
　　河南第一所妇女大学
    本报讯　河南登封县文村乡雷村社在妇女社长郑凤英的带动下，办起了全省第一所妇女大学。
    学校由乡妇联和驻社干部等七人组成了学委会，乡、社干部捐出三十多元购买图书、纸张。乡俱乐部还赠送了一百多本农业技术和小学课本等书籍。所以，社里没花一个钱，就把妇女大学办起来了。
    学习内容分政治、妇女基本知识、妇幼卫生、农业技术、语文等课目。
　　鞍山钢铁学院成立
    据新华社讯　钢都鞍山的第一所高等学府——鞍山钢铁学院已在9月初成立。
    这所四年制的新型大学，是由原来的鞍钢业余大学、鞍山第二钢铁工业学校、鞍钢业余钢铁学校、鞍山老干部文化补习学校和东北工学院函授部等单位合并组成的。根据国家的需要，它设有矿冶和机电两个系，包括采矿、冶炼、轧钢、冶金工厂机械装备、工业企业电气化五个专业。为了更多更快地培养出钢铁工业急需的各方面的人才，这所学校还设有大学夜校部、中技班和中技夜校部、工人班和函授部。全院现在共有二千多名学生和教职员工。
    学院的院长由鞍钢经理袁振兼任，他在学院成立大会上指出，这个学校的任务，是根据教育必须与生产劳动相结合的方针，培养既有社会主义觉悟又有钢铁技术知识的建设人才。学生在学习期间内，要有四分之一的时间参加劳动。
