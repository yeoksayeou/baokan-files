Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, September 26th: Anshan Iron and Steel workers warmly responded to the call made by Comrade Li Fuchun on behalf of the Party Central Committee, striving to overfulfill this year's leap forward plan of 4.5 million tons of steel. On the same day they heard the report – the 25th – they created a new record for daily steel production. The steel output on this day was 3,639 tons more than the average daily output in August, and 2,700 tons more than the average daily output in the first and middle ten-day periods of September. The Second Steel Plant's steel output on that day reached 7,030 tons, more than 700 tons higher than the average daily planned output for September, with a daily utilization coefficient reaching 10.63.

    On the 25th, after hearing Comrade Li Fuchun's report, Anshan Iron and Steel workers were greatly encouraged and held discussions, determined to achieve results that very day.

    After setting a new record of 6,449 tons on August 29th, the workers of the Second Steel Plant had tried many times to break the 7,000-ton barrier, but had never succeeded, only reaching levels above 6,000 tons on several occasions. However, the steelworkers were not discouraged. They summed up their lessons, cast off the "head-shakers" and "doubters" who held them back, launched a mass movement to maintain the furnace bodies, and took many new measures to launch another attack on the 7,000-ton barrier. On the 25th, after hearing Comrade Li Fuchun's report, their enthusiasm was even greater. They continued to load more and refine faster. The average furnace load on that day increased by nearly 30% compared to the past. Of the twenty-five furnaces of steel refined, fast steelmaking in under nine hours accounted for more than half, finally breaking through the barrier and releasing the high-yield satellite of 7,030 tons of steel in a day.

    After hearing Comrade Li Fuchun's report, the workers on several newly put-into-production large-scale fixed open-hearth furnaces were eager to show their skills and stated that they must work hard and vigorously. As a result, the steel output on the 25th exceeded the plan by 11%.

    After discussing Comrade Li Fuchun's report, the workers of the No. 9 open-hearth furnace of the First Steel Plant refined more than 300 tons of steel than planned on the same day.

    Now, Anshan Iron and Steel workers are further deeply discussing Comrade Li Fuchun's report, and, based on the spirit of the report, are carrying out extensive airing of views and debates, striving to thoroughly liberate their thinking, fully exploit their production potential, and release more and bigger high-yield satellites to offer as gifts to National Day.

    彻底解放思想  充分发挥潜力
    鞍钢钢的日产量创新纪录
    第二炼钢厂同一天产量破七千吨大关
    据新华社鞍山26日电  鞍钢职工热烈响应李富春同志代表党中央向他们发出的号召，力争超额完成今年产钢四百五十万吨的跃进计划，在听了报告的当天——25日，就创造了炼钢日产量最新纪录。这一天的产钢量，比8月份平均日产量多出三千六百三十九吨，比9月上、中两旬平均日产量多出二千七百吨。第二炼钢厂当天的钢产量达到七千零三十吨，比9月份的每天平均计划产量高出七百多吨，日历利用系数达到了十点六三。
    25日，鞍钢职工听了李富春同志的报告以后，受到了极大的鼓舞，纷纷举行座谈，决心当天就要做出成绩来。
    第二炼钢厂的职工在8月29日创造了日产六千四百四十九吨的新纪录以后，曾经多次试行突破七千吨大关，然而始终没有突破，只是多次达到了六千吨以上的水平。但是炼钢工人们并没有因此而气馁。他们总结教训，甩掉拖后腿的“摇头派”、“怀疑派”，开展群众性的维护炉体运动，采取许多新的措施，再接再厉地向七千吨大关发动了进攻。25日，在听了李富春同志的报告后，他们的干劲更足，继续进行多装快炼，当天每炉钢的装炉量平均比过去增大了将近30％，所炼的二十五炉钢，九小时以下的快速炼钢占一半以上，终于冲破关口放出了日产钢七千零三十吨的高产卫星。
    几座新投入生产的大型固定式平炉上的职工听了李富春同志的报告以后，个个磨拳擦掌，表示一定要大干猛干，结果25日的钢产量超过计划11％。
    第一炼钢厂九号平炉的工人在讨论了李富春同志的报告以后，当天就比计划多炼了三百多吨钢。
    现在，鞍钢的职工们正在进一步深入讨论李富春同志的报告，并且根据报告精神展开了大鸣大放和大争大辩，力求彻底解放思想，充分发挥生产潜力，放出更多更大的高产卫星向国庆节献礼。
