Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Taipei: Starting this morning, the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique began a large-scale joint amphibious assault force beach landing exercise in Fangliao, southern Taiwan. This is yet another military provocation against the Chinese people.

The United States' decision to hold an exercise of this nature with the Chiang Kai-shek clique for the first time at this moment is clearly not the so-called "routine training" that the United States is promoting. It can be clearly seen from the scale and nature of the exercise that this is an open preparation by the United States to launch a military attack on the People's Republic of China.

A large number of ships and Marines from the U.S. Seventh Fleet, as well as naval vessels and Marines from the Chiang bandits, participated in the exercise. The United States also provided "large-scale air cover" for the landing exercise. The United States has kept secret the total number of U.S. warships, aircraft, and Marines participating in the exercise. According to a report by the Chiang bandit Central News Agency on the 7th, a total of 40 to 50 U.S. and Chiang various warships and 80 to 90 landing craft and transport boats participated in the exercise. According to an announcement by the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command as early as the 1st, the first batch of 3,800 U.S. Marines who arrived in Taiwan on August 31 to participate in the exercise, and after this "advance force," U.S. troops would continue to arrive daily before the exercise. An Associated Press reporter reported from Fangliao that an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 U.S. and Chiang troops are participating in the exercise.

Admiral Bickley, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, which has been carrying out provocative activities in the Taiwan Strait, is going to command the exercise.

According to the exercise plan announced by the U.S. and Chiang sides, the U.S. and Chiang troops will first use naval artillery fire and low-flying aircraft to attack, and then the Marines will forcibly land on the beach to "destroy" a "hypothetical enemy."

Prior to the Fangliao exercise, the U.S. and Chiang Marines jointly conducted an "offensive exercise" in Zuoying on the 6th. The Chiang army claimed that after the Fangliao amphibious landing exercise, a joint sea-air exercise would follow.

It is clear that these are all military attack rehearsals aimed at the People's Republic of China. U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander He Zhigang, director of the U.S.-Chiang joint news release center for the exercise, said on the afternoon of the 7th that the purpose of the exercise was to make the U.S.-Chiang "joint operations plans and execution more skilled." An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Taipei on the 4th also said that the exercise "is clearly intended to show the strength of the U.S. armed forces, rather than a routine training."

### 美国继续加紧对我国挑衅  和蒋帮举行两栖登陆演习

　　美国继续加紧对我国挑衅
　　和蒋帮举行两栖登陆演习
    新华社8日讯　台北消息：从今天清晨起，美国和蒋介石卖国集团开始在台湾南部的枋寮联合举行大规模的两栖作战部队海滩登陆演习。这是针对中国人民进行的又一军事挑衅。
    美国选择在目前时机同蒋介石集团第一次举行这样性质的演习，显然绝不是美国方面宣传的所谓“例行训练”。无论从演习的规模或性质上都可以清楚地看到，这是美国企图对中华人民共和国发动军事进攻的公开准备。
    美国第七舰队的大批舰艇和海军陆战队，以及蒋贼海军舰艇和海军陆战队，参加这次演习。美国并且为这次登陆演习提供“大规模空中掩护”。美国方面对参加演习的美国军舰、飞机和海军陆战队总数秘不宣布。据蒋贼中央社7日透露，参加演习的美蒋各种军舰共有四十艘到五十艘，登陆用的机械小艇和运输艇八十艘到九十艘。据美国侵台司令部早在1日宣布，8月31日到达台湾参加这次演习的美国第一批海军陆战队就有三千八百人，而继这批“先遣部队”以后，在举行演习前还要每天有美军部队到达。美联社记者自枋寮报道，参加演习的美蒋军队估计有八千人到一万人。
    一直在台湾海峡进行挑衅活动的美国第七舰队的司令比克利，要去指挥这次演习。
    根据美蒋方面公布的演习计划，美蒋部队将先用海军炮火和低空飞行的飞机进行攻击，然后海军陆战队在海滩强行登陆，来“摧毁”一个“假设的敌人”。
    在这次枋寮演习以前，美蒋海军陆战队已于6日在左营联合进行过一次“进攻演习”。蒋军方面宣称，在枋寮两栖登陆演习后，接着还要举行海空联合演习。
    很明显，这些都是一种予头针对着中华人民共和国的军事进攻预演。美蒋演习的联合新闻发布中心主任美国海军中校何志刚7日下午表示，这次演习就是要使美蒋“联合作战的计划与执行更趋熟练”。法新社4日从台北发出的消息里也说，这次演习“显然是为了显示美国的武装力量，而不是一次例行的训练”。
