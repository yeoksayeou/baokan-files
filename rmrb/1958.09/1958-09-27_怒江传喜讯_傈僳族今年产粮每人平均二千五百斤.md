Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 26th (Reporter Chen Zheng) - Good news of a bumper harvest of grain crops across a large area has arrived from the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, nestled in the valleys of the Gaoligong and Biluo Snow Mountains. Currently, the early-maturing crops in the autonomous prefecture have been harvested. The average yield of rice per mu is over 800 jin, and corn generally yields between 800 and 1,000 jin. The total grain output this year is expected to jump from 50 million jin last year to 360 million jin, with an average of 2,500 jin of grain per person. The remote and impoverished Nujiang region will no longer need to import grain from other places.

The Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture is a region transitioning directly from the late stage of primitive communal society to socialism. The autonomous prefecture has steep terrain and is prone to natural disasters. Before liberation, the Lisu people who lived here used wooden hoes to plant crops on steep slopes and in rock crevices, and pursued wild animals with crossbows. Each person only had an average of 200 jin of grain per year. In the early days after liberation, remnants of the primitive clan society of communal labor and eating remained here. People attributed the success or failure of the harvest, and the high or low output, to the moods of God and spirits, and the goodness or badness of personal fate. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Lisu people transitioned directly to socialism and moved forward in great strides. By 1957, grain production had doubled. However, the idea of relying on heaven for production still occupied a major position. After last autumn, the Great Leap Forward movement in production began. At that time, some people emphasized the poor natural conditions of Nujiang, the lack of technical strength, the poor work foundation, the poverty of the people, as well as the special characteristics of ethnic customs and border location, believing that the autonomous prefecture could only do things slowly and be taken care of by the state. However, the autonomous prefecture Party committee grasped the essential issue of the masses' urgent desire to develop production and launched a widespread debate among the masses. As a result, the poor and lower-middle peasants, who constituted the majority of the population, believed that in order to completely change the face of poverty and backwardness, it was necessary to do more, do it faster, and do it on a large scale. Thus, a Great Leap Forward movement in production, centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, unfolded vigorously throughout the prefecture.

With the deepening development of the production movement, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives this spring increased to 86.8%, and the entire prefecture achieved cooperativization.

The Lisu people, who had realized cooperativization, opened up mountains and ridges and built more than 2,000 ditches and more than 600 reservoirs in just six months, and newly opened 80,000 mu of winding and tidy terraced fields on steep cliffs. The total amount of fertilizer applied this year increased by 50 times compared with last year, completely changing the historical habit of planting "white water seedlings" and "hygienic land." There has been great improvement in farming techniques. They have also created more than 100 new types of iron and wooden farm tools, and successfully trial-produced tools suitable for mountain transportation such as chutes, flying buckets, and mountain vehicles. Various counties have also widely carried out large-scale socialist collaboration, enhancing unity within the ethnic group. The class consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants has been greatly enhanced, and a large number of backbone elements have emerged.

The fact that tremendous changes have taken place in the production, political, and ideological outlook of the Nujiang area proves that if border minority nationalities are to rapidly enter the ranks of advanced socialist nationalities, they must break down all "backward theories" and "special theories."

    怒江传喜讯
    傈僳族今年产粮每人平均二千五百斤
    据新华社昆明26日电  记者陈铮报道：从高黎贡山和碧罗雪山的峡谷地带——怒江傈僳族自治州传出了粮食作物大面积丰收的喜讯。目前，自治州的早熟作物已收割完毕，水稻平均亩产八百斤以上，玉米一般在八百斤到一千斤左右。今年的粮食总产量预计将由去年的五千万斤跃增到三亿六千万斤，每人平均粮食可达二千五百斤。偏僻贫困的怒江地区，从此再也不用从外地运进粮食了。
    怒江傈僳族自治州是由原始公社社会末期直接向社会主义过渡的地区。自治州地势陡峭，自然灾害特多。居住在这里的傈僳人，解放前一直使用木锄在陡坡上和石缝中种庄稼，用弩弓追袭野兽，每年每人平均只有二百斤粮食。解放初期，这里还保留着共耕共吃的原始氏族社会的残余。人们把年成的丰歉、产量的高低，都归之于上帝鬼神的喜怒和个人命运的好坏。解放后，傈僳族人民在共产党的领导下，直接向社会主义过渡，大踏步地前进。到1957年，粮食产量增加了一倍。但是，生产上靠天吃饭的思想仍占主要地位。去年秋后，生产大跃进运动开始了，当时有一部分人强调怒江自然条件不好，没有技术力量，工作基础差，人民贫困，以及民族风俗习惯和地处边疆等特殊性，认为自治州只能慢慢的干，由国家包下来干。但是自治州党委抓住了广大群众迫切要求发展生产的本质问题，发动群众广泛辩论。结果，占人口大多数的贫农、下中农认为：要彻底改变贫困落后的面貌，就必须多干、快干、大干。于是一个以水利积肥为中心的生产大跃进运动，在全州范围内蓬勃展开了。
    在生产运动的深入发展的同时，今春加入合作社的农户增加到86.8％，全州实现了合作化。
    实现了合作化的傈僳族人民，在短短的六个月中，就开山辟岭兴修了两千多条水沟和六百多座水库，在陡峭的岩壁上增开了八万亩蜿蜒整齐的梯田。今年总施肥量比去年增加了五十倍，彻底改变了历史上栽“白水秧”、“卫生地”的习惯。耕作技术上有很大改进。他们还创造了一百多种新式铁木农具，试制成功了适合山区运输的溜槽、飞兜、山地车等工具。各县还广泛开展社会主义大协作，增进了民族内部的团结。广大贫农、下中农的阶级觉悟大大提高，骨干分子大批涌现。
    怒江地区生产、政治、思想面貌发生巨大变化的事实，证明了边疆少数民族要迅速地跨进社会主义先进民族的行列，必须破除一切“落后论”和“特殊论”。
