　　Reflections on Education Reform Inspired by Old-Style Opera Troupes
　　He Qingnian

　　With the great leap in production, a cultural revolution has now begun. Counties are establishing universities, young farmers are entering academies of science, and an ordinary person has uncovered the mysteries of the termite world, becoming an expert in this field of science. Consequently, some people find it a bit difficult to accept, claiming that these scientific workers from working-class backgrounds are not from formal academic backgrounds, haven't received rigorous scientific training, and can't be considered scientific workers at all.

　　"Formal education" advocates have a special yardstick in their minds. In their view, only those who go from elementary school to middle school, from middle school to university, from university to studying abroad, and obtain some kind of academic title can be called formally educated. As for whether their "knowledge" is practical, that's perfectly fine to ignore. This perfectly depicts the ugly picture of the separation of mental and physical labor in class society, forcing people to develop in a distorted manner.

　　In capitalist society, the separation of mental labor and physical labor, the separation of theory and practice, is by no means an isolated phenomenon. This situation, reflected in the cultural and educational system, has formed that so-called formal education system of "from elementary school to middle school, from middle school to university, from university to studying abroad," etc., which allows people to be out of touch with the world and not engage in production for decades. Agricultural experts from this kind of formal education may not know how to farm, mechanical manufacturing experts dare not operate machines, and entomology experts can only sigh helplessly at the harm caused by termites. Yet, they can still consider themselves regular based on this and use it as capital to roll their eyes and put on airs, isn't that one of the most absurd things in the world! I am not saying that there are absolutely no people with real talent and learning in the old society, but in class society, those who truly shine in academics are often not the kind of formally educated people they idealize. We only need to cite the examples of three great scholars, Li Shizhen, Darwin, and Michurin, to know that their brilliant achievements were not cultivated in the highest institutions of learning at the time. One's knowledge was extracted from wandering in deep mountains and valleys, one was broad and profound from venturing across the ocean, and one shone brilliantly from dedicating his life to an orchard. The path they took precisely illustrates that the combination of theory and practice is the only correct path to research knowledge and cultivate talent.

　　In class society, people who can achieve achievements like Li Shizhen and Darwin are extremely rare and few. This is the inevitable result of the separation of education and labor.

　　Lenin called the separation of theory and practice the most hateful phenomenon in capitalist society, and the bourgeois teaching system is a hotbed for cultivating this most hateful phenomenon in large quantities. Only in our era can we eliminate the educational system inherited from tradition that cultivates people towards distorted development. Our Party has put forward the policy and line of educational reform that combines education with productive labor, which is the most thorough revolution of the thousands of years of educational tradition. This year, the enrollment system of higher education institutions in our country stipulates the priority and even the exemption of entrance examinations for the enrollment of workers and peasant youths, which is precisely implementing the Party's policy and line. It is not difficult for us to see that in the future, thousands upon thousands of workers and peasants will become laborers with a high degree of culture.

　　由旧科班想到教育改革
    何庆年
    随着生产大跃进而来的文化大革命在目前已经揭开了序幕。县里办起了大学，青年农民进了科学院，一个普通的人揭开了白蚁世界之谜，成了这一门科学中的专家。于是有些人觉得有点看不惯了，说什么这些劳动人民出身的科学工作者并非科班出身，没有受过严密的科学训练，并不能算什么科学工作者云云。
    “科班论”者脑子里装有一个特别的尺度。在他们看来：只有由小学而中学，由中学而大学，由大学而留学，再得一个什么样学衔的人才称得起是科班出身。至于他们的“学问”是否能够实用，倒是满可以不管的。这正好刻划出了阶级社会中脑力劳动和体力劳动相割裂，逼使人们向畸形发展的一幅丑图。
    在资本主义社会中，脑力劳动和体力劳动相割裂、理论和实践相割裂的现象绝不是个别的，这种情形反映在文化教育系统中就形成了那种“由小学而中学，由中学而大学，由大学而留学”等等一套使人可以十数年乃至数十年不问世事、不事生产的所谓科班制度。从这种科班出身的农业专家可以不会种田，机械制造专家不敢操作机器，昆虫学专家只好对着白蚁的危害望洋兴叹。然而，他们却还可以据此自视为正规，作为向别人翻白眼摆架子的资本，岂不也是天下之一大荒唐事！我并不是说，在旧社会里绝对没有真才实学的人，但是在阶级社会中，真正在学术上放出异彩的人，往往不是他们所理想的那种科班出身。我们只要举出李时珍、达尔文和米丘林这三个伟大的学者的例子来就会知道，他们那些光辉的成就都不是在当时的最高学府里修练出来的。他们三人的学问一个是在辗转于深山野谷中得出精华的，一个是在远涉重洋中博大精深的，一个是终生效劳于果园中放出异彩的。他们所走过的道路，正是说明了理论与实践结合是研究学问和造就人才的唯一正确的道路。
    在阶级社会中能够达到像李时珍和达尔文这样成就的人实在是凤毛麟角，屈指可数。这正是教育与劳动割裂所造成的必然结果。
    列宁把理论与实践相割裂的现象称为资本主义社会中最可憎的现象，而资产阶级的教学制度正是大量培植这种最可憎现象的温床。只有到了我们这个时代，才能铲除传统留下来的培养人们向畸形发展的教育制度，我们党提出了教育与生产劳动结合的教育改革的方针和路线，这正是对于几千年的教育传统的一次最彻底的革命。今年我国高等学校招生的制度规定了优先乃至免试录取工农青年，正是贯彻着党的这一方针和路线的。我们不难看到，今后，将有千千万万工农劳动群众，成为具有高度文化的劳动者。
