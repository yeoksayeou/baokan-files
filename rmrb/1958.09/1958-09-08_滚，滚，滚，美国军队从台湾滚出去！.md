　　Get out, get out, get out, American troops get out of Taiwan!
　　Letter from all students of Beijing No. 4 Middle School: After listening to Premier Zhou's statement, more than 2,460 students of Beijing No. 4 Middle School, with soaring anger, automatically gathered on the playground and marched enthusiastically to the streets, with more than 2,000 voices shouting, "Get out! Get out! Get out! American troops get out of Taiwan!" "Sacred territory is not to be violated!" "We must liberate Taiwan!" Some classes composed songs, some classes composed skits, wrote 10,000 big-character posters in ten minutes, and made countless slogans, every sentence and word burning with infinite love for the motherland and unparalleled hatred for American imperialism.
　　It is universally recognized that Taiwan has been an inalienable part of Chinese territory since ancient times, and Taiwan compatriots are our own brothers and sisters. However, the American imperialists turn a deaf ear, have occupied China's Taiwan for eight years, have always been enemies of the Chinese people in various international affairs, and have disregarded the Chinese people's solemn warnings and are carrying out even more rampant provocations, which is also a threat and provocation to peace in Asia and the world.
　　American imperialism has always been a defeated opponent of the Chinese people. Can the heroic Chinese people not stop the aggression of American imperialism?
　　We fully support Premier Zhou's statement. We are carrying out a major reform of education under the leadership of the Party. Today, we put down our reading books and take to the streets; tomorrow, in the struggle to liberate Taiwan, if the motherland needs us, we can put down our pens and pick up weapons to fight for the sacred sovereignty of the motherland and for the complete unification of the motherland!
　　We also firmly believe that the cause of the unification of the motherland will soon be victorious, the people of Taiwan will return to the embrace of the motherland, and the shameless enemy will surely fail and surely die!
　　Letter from the Research Class of the Department of Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, Renmin University of China: On the evening of the 6th, we listened to Premier Zhou's statement on behalf of our government regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait region and expressed our firm support. We could not suppress the excitement in our hearts and immediately participated in the demonstration parade of 10,000 teachers and students on campus, expressing our serious protest against the American invasion of our country's sovereignty and territory. We discussed Premier Zhou's statement, and everyone unanimously believed that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have been our territory since ancient times, and the liberation of Taiwan is our people's natural responsibility. The United States has no reason to interfere in our country's internal affairs. Some comrades said, "The people of Taiwan have long suffered from the rule and oppression of imperialism and reactionaries and are in dire straits. Now the people on the mainland have long been liberated, and we cannot tolerate the people of Taiwan being in a state of oppression and enslavement." Some comrades said, "The motherland is in a situation of great leap forward, and the people's communes have been established and are beginning to transition to communism, while the people of Taiwan are still in a slave status in the colony. We must strive for another leap forward and fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan."
　　Everyone unanimously expressed that we must liberate Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the Jinmen and Mazu Islands. All the students are determined to contribute everything to the liberation of Taiwan. Some comrades who were transferred military personnel said, "We are transferred military personnel. When we were transferred, Chairman Mao told us that when the motherland needs us to take up guns again, we will listen to the call of the motherland. We firmly listen to Chairman Mao's words, and we await the call of the motherland." Some comrades expressed that they must redouble their efforts and do a good job in their current work, study current affairs hard, improve their ideological level, and prepare for the call of the motherland. After the meeting, all the students immediately took action, wrote slogans, drew cartoons, and prepared to participate in the demonstration against the American aggressors.
　　Letter from the staff of the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: American imperialism is gathering forces in the Taiwan Strait region to carry out provocations. The warmonger Dulles also issued absurd statements, reversing black and white and confusing right and wrong, which is infuriating.
　　Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the coastal islands are inseparable territories of our country, and the liberation of these regions is purely our country's internal affair, and no foreign country is allowed to interfere. We fully support Premier Zhou's statement. If the American imperialists disregard the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world, despise the just public opinion of the world, and continue to carry out military provocations and impose war on the 600 million Chinese people, we will never be intimidated by it. We will use practical actions to support Premier Zhou's statement and, under the leadership of our Party and government and with the support of the just forces of the world, fight American imperialism to the end.
　　Letter from teachers, students, and staff of Beijing Normal University's Workers and Peasants Middle School and Beijing Dongcheng Normal School: American imperialism's military provocations against our country are becoming more and more rampant, which cannot but arouse our great indignation! Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times. The liberation of Taiwan is the determination of the 600 million Chinese people, and no force can stop our will to liberate Taiwan!
　　We once again warn American imperialism to stop its military provocations against China as soon as possible, otherwise, you will be badly battered!
　　All of our teachers and students firmly support Premier Zhou's statement. In order to make Taiwan return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, we will take practical actions and be ready at all times to respond to the call of the motherland and defend peace in the Far East.

　　滚，滚，滚，美国军队从台湾滚出去！
    北京四中全体学生来信：听完周总理的声明，北京四中二千四百六十多个同学，带着冲天的愤怒，自动汇集在操场，激昂地奔向大街，二千多张嘴高呼着“滚！滚！滚！美国军队滚出台湾去！”“神圣的领土不准侵犯！”“一定要解放台湾！”有的班编了歌，有的班编了活报剧，十分钟写了万张大字报，做了无数标语牌，句句字字都燃烧着对祖国无限热爱，对美帝无比仇恨。
    全世界公认，台湾自古是中国领土不可分割的一部分，台湾同胞是我们的亲兄弟。可是美帝国主义置若罔闻，侵占中国台湾八年之久，在各项国际事务中始终与中国人民为敌，还不顾中国人民的严正警告，进行更猖狂的挑衅，这也是对亚洲和世界和平的威胁和挑衅。
    美帝国主义历来是中国人民的手下败将，英雄的中国人民难道还不能制止美帝国主义的侵略行为吗？
    我们完全支持周总理的声明。我们正在党的领导下，进行着教育大改革，今天，我们放下阅读的书籍走上街头；明天，在解放台湾的斗争里，假若祖国需要，我们可以放下笔杆，拿起武器，为祖国神圣的主权而战，为祖国的完全统一而战！
    我们也深信，祖国的统一事业一定很快胜利，台湾人民一定会回到祖国的怀抱，无耻的敌人一定失败、一定死亡！
    中国人民大学马列主义基础系研究班来信：6日晚上，我们听了周总理代表我国政府关于台湾海峡地区局势问题的声明，表示坚决拥护。我们压制不住内心的激动，即刻参加了校内一万师生的示威游行，对美国侵犯我国主权和领土的行为表示严重的抗议。我们讨论了周总理的声明，大家一致认为，台湾、澎湖地区自古以来就是我国的领土，解放台湾是我国人民当然的责任，美国没有任何理由干涉我国的内政。有的同志说：“台湾人民长期受帝国主义及反动派的统治和压迫，处于水深火热之中。现在大陆人民早已得到解放，我们不能容忍台湾人民处于被压迫和受奴役的地位。”有的同志说：“祖国处于大跃进的形势，人民公社已经建立，开始向共产主义过渡，而台湾人民还处于殖民地的奴隶地位，我们一定努力再跃进，为解放台湾而斗争到底”。
    大家一致表示，我们一定要解放台湾、澎湖列岛和金门、马祖诸岛。全体同学决心为解放台湾贡献出自己的一切。有些转业军人的同学说：“我们是转业军人，在转业的时候，毛主席告诉我们，当祖国再需要我们拿起枪杆的时候，听从祖国的召唤。我们坚决听毛主席的话，我们等待祖国的召唤。”有的同志表示，一定要百倍地鼓足干劲，做好当前的工作。努力学习时事，提高思想水平，准备祖国的召唤。会后，全体同学，马上行动起来，写标语，画漫画，准备参加反对美国侵略者的游行示威大会。
    中国科学院语言研究所工作人员来信：美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区集结兵力，进行挑衅。战争贩子杜勒斯并发表荒谬声明，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，令人发指。
    台湾、澎湖列岛以及沿海岛屿是我国的不可分割的领土，解放这些地区纯粹是我国的内政，不许任何外国加以干涉。我们完全拥护周总理的声明。美帝国主义如果不顾全世界爱好和平人民的愿望，蔑视全世界的公正舆论，继续进行军事挑衅，要把战争强加在六亿中国人民的头上，我们决不会为它所吓倒。我们要用实际行动来支持周总理的声明，在我们的党和政府的领导下，在全世界的正义力量的支持下，与美帝国主义斗争到底。
    北京师大工农中学和北京东城师范师生员工来信：美帝国主义对我国的军事挑衅越来越猖狂了，这不能不引起我们极大的愤慨！台湾自古以来就是中国的领土。解放台湾是六亿中国人民的决心，任何力量都阻止不了我们解放台湾的意志！
    我们再次地警告美帝国主义，及早地停止对中国的军事挑衅，否则，你将碰得头破血流！
    我们全体师生坚决拥护周总理的声明。为了使台湾早日回到祖国的怀抱，我们将以实际行动，时刻准备着响应祖国的召唤，保卫远东的和平。
