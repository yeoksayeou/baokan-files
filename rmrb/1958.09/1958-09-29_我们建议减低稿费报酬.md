    We Suggest Reducing Manuscript Fees
    Zhang Tianyi Zhou Libo Ai Wu
    Recently, a symposium on mass literary creation and other issues was held, discussing many issues of literary thought, as well as manuscript fees. We would like to express some opinions on the issue of manuscript fees.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of workers and peasants have not only been fighting hard day and night, but also voluntarily requested the cancellation of overtime pay and bonuses. Many piece-rate workers also resolutely refused to accept wages calculated based on the post-Leap Forward output. Their slogan is "We want the red flag, not money." It should be said that this is the best manifestation of the laboring people's increased communist consciousness. It is well worth the consideration of writers regarding their own manuscript fees. Many of our writers, in the past six months, have gone deep into the masses and have seen firsthand the masses' soaring enthusiasm, the masses' communist spirit of "one for all, all for one," and have also deeply felt the unreasonableness of the current excessive manuscript fees. In fact, due to excessive manuscript fees, there is a great distance between writers and the lives of the masses, the spirit of the times, and it has already created a bad influence among young literary workers and enthusiasts. In recent years, many speculators and plagiarists have emerged, and some amateur writers, in pursuit of manuscript fees, are even unwilling to focus on their own jobs, wholeheartedly wanting to become professional writers. In reality, doing so is hindering them from engaging in literary creation, because once they are divorced from life, they cannot write anything. In addition, some writers are also calculating over manuscript fees.
    Now, in our social life, the seeds of communism have already appeared. Our writers must first have the spirit of communism, and quickly abandon the idea of writing for remuneration. Haggling over the level of manuscript fees will prevent one from entering a communist society. Although we have not yet entered a communist society immediately, and are still in a period of transition, manuscript fees cannot be abolished immediately, but reducing manuscript fees is very appropriate and very necessary. Because manuscript fees are too high, writers' lives easily become special and easily detached from the masses. Once writers are detached from the masses, it is equivalent to cutting off the source of creation, and they will not be able to write anything. Furthermore, a writer who dedicates himself to the revolutionary cause should never have thought of engaging in literary creation to get rich, but rather believes that literature can serve the people and is a part of the revolutionary cause. What he should mainly care about is whether his works can educate and inspire the people, and whether they can help the people quickly acquire communist ideas, feelings, and moral qualities.
    Of course, there are also individual writers who, because they suddenly get a lot of manuscript fees, lose their way and only plan in terms of manuscript fees. It is said that there is such a writer who wrote a work of more than ten thousand words. The editor read it and felt it was too verbose and should be cut in half. So he asked the writer to revise it. Not only did he not delete a word, but he added many more words. He just wanted more words so he could get more manuscript fees. Such writers will definitely be dissatisfied with writing in a future communist society without manuscript fees, and with the current reduction in manuscript fees. He may stop writing. Then let him not write. His works, which only seek length and not brilliance, are only for the sake of RMB and not for the service of the people, and it is better to have none.
    We estimate that the current implementation of reducing manuscript fees will not have a significant impact on writers' lives. Among the two thousand members of the Chinese Writers Association and its branches, most are amateur writers. They have always lived on wages, and the amount of manuscript fees has no impact on their lives. As for professional writers, there are really very few in number. Moreover, many professional writers hold some positions in various provinces and cities, and can also take part of their wages when necessary, so their lives will not be a problem. In short, the era of worrying about financial difficulties and writers complaining about poverty is long gone. Finally, to ask, will creation not flourish if manuscript fees are reduced? We can definitely say that it absolutely will not. Writers with communist ideas will not write for manuscript fees, and will definitely be able to wholeheartedly create better, more beautiful, and more perfect communist literature in the nationwide Great Leap Forward towards a communist society. And the amateur creations of workers and peasants will also develop vigorously without any connection to money. In addition, many veteran cadres can also engage in literary creation with confidence and boldness. It is said that many veteran cadres can only secretly write novels and dramas, because they are afraid that others will laugh at them for writing to earn large manuscript fees. Once manuscript fees are reduced, they can also be unconcerned. In this way, long masterpieces will surely emerge in large numbers. We dare to predict: the era of truly flourishing literary creation has already arrived.
    The editorial departments of the four literary publications in Shanghai – ("Harvest," "Literary Monthly," "Sprout," and "Leap Forward Literary Research Series") have decided to reduce manuscript fees by half, which is a very meaningful measure. We suggest that Beijing and other local newspapers and periodicals should reduce publication fees by half like Shanghai. When the conditions are ripe, the manuscript fee system can be abolished altogether.

    我们建议减低稿费报酬
    张天翼  周立波  艾芜
    最近曾开过群众文艺创作等问题的座谈会，谈了不少文艺思想上的问题，也谈到稿费问题。我们想对稿费问题表示些意见。
    自从大跃进以来，广大工农群众，不仅夜以继日地进行苦战，而且自动地要求取消加班费，取消奖励金。许多计件工资的工人，也坚决不要按照跃进后产量发给的工资。他们的口号是“我们要红旗，不要钞票”。应该说，这是劳动人民共产主义觉悟提高的最好的表现。很值得作家们考虑自己的稿费报酬问题。我们很多作家在近半年来，都深入了群众，亲眼看到了群众的冲天干劲，群众的“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义精神，也深深地感到目前稿费报酬过高的不合理。事实上由于稿酬过高，使作家同群众的生活、时代的精神有很大的距离，而且在广大青年文艺工作者和文艺爱好者中间已经造成了恶劣的影响，近年来出现了不少投机者和抄袭者，还有些业余作者为了追求稿费，甚至不安心本职工作，一心要当专业作家，实际上这样做正是妨碍了他们从事文艺创作，因为他们脱离了生活就什么也写不出来了。另外，有一些作家也斤斤计较稿费。
    现在在我们的社会生活中，已经出现了共产主义的萌芽。我们作家必须首先具有共产主义的精神，把为报酬而写作的思想，赶快抛掉。斤斤计较稿费的高低，是进不了共产主义社会的。目前还没有马上进入共产主义社会，还在过渡期间，稿费还不能马上取消，但把稿费减低是非常适合和非常必要的。因为稿费太高，作家的生活，容易特殊化，容易脱离群众。作家一脱离了群众，就等于断绝了创作的源泉，就会什么东西也写不出来的。再说，一个为革命事业献身的作家，应该是一向就没有想过为了发财才从事文艺创作，而是认为文艺能为人民服务，是革命事业的一部分。他主要应该关心的，是他写的作品，能不能对人民起教育和鼓舞的作用，能不能帮助人民迅速地具有共产主义的思想感情和道德品质。
    当然也有个别的作家，由于稿费一下子得的多了，使他迷失了方向，只在稿费方面去打算盘。听说有这么一个作家，写了一篇万多字的作品，编辑看了，觉得太罗嗦，应该删去一半，于是请这位作家修改，他不但不删去一字，反而又增加了许多字。他就是想字数越多，稿费越拿得多。像这样的作家，对于将来在共产主义社会里面，不为稿费而写作，以及现在减少稿费，一定会不满的。他可能停笔不写，那就让他不写吧，他那只求长而不求精彩的作品，只是为人民币着想，而不为人民服务的作品，倒是没有的好。
    我们估计一下，目前实行减低稿费，对于作家的生活影响不大。中国作家协会及各分会两千会员里面，大多数是业余作家，他们一向靠工资生活，稿费多少，对他们的生活没有丝毫影响。至于专业作家，实在是数目很少。而且专业作家中，有好多人在各省市，都担任有一部分职务，在必要时也可以拿部分工资，生活也不会成问题。总之，担心生活困难与作家叫穷的时代，早已一去不复返了。最后要问一下，稿费减少，创作会不会就不繁荣了？我们肯定地说，绝对不会的。我们有共产主义思想的作家，是不会为稿费而写作的，一定能够在全国人民向共产主义社会大跃进中，一心一意创造更好更美更完善的共产主义的文学。而一些工人农民的群众业余创作，也会在与金钱无关的情形下，蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。另外有好多老干部，也可以放心大胆地从事文艺创作。听说好些老干部，只能偷偷地写小说戏剧，他们就怕别人嘲笑他写作是为了大赚稿费。稿费一减少，他们也就可以毫无顾忌了。这样一来，长篇巨著，一定会大量地涌现出来。我们敢预言：文艺创作真正繁荣的时代业已到来了。
    上海的四个文艺刊物——（“收获”、“文艺月报”、“萌芽”和“跃进文学研究丛刊”）的编辑部，决定把稿费降低一半，是一项很有意义的措施。我们建议北京和各地报刊应该像上海一样把刊物发表费减去一半。到了条件成熟时，可以根本取消稿费制度。
