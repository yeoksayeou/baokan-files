    French Guinea and Niger

    French Guinea is one of the eight territories of French West Africa. It has an area of approximately 270,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 2.5 million. It was invaded and occupied by France in 1895.

    In recent years, under the increasingly high tide of the Asian-African national independence movement, the people of French West Africa have also become increasingly awakened. In early 1957, the French National Assembly passed a law granting "local autonomy" to French West Africa, establishing so-called "semi-autonomous republics." However, this trick cannot deceive anyone. The people of French West Africa have continued their struggle for national independence.

    Niger has an area of more than 1.2 million square kilometers and a population of more than 2 million. It was invaded and occupied by France in 1904. In recent years, the struggle of the people of Niger for independence has also been on the rise. In early September this year, the founding congress of the Sawaba Niger Committee of the African People's Union, held in the capital Niamey, passed a resolution demanding immediate independence.

    法属几内亚和尼日尔
    法属几内亚是法属西非洲八个领地之一。它的面积约二十七万余平方公里，人口约二百五十万人。1895年被法国侵占。
    近年来，在亚非民族独立运动日益高涨的形势下，法属西非人民也日益觉醒。1957年初法国国民议会通过给予法属西非洲“地方自治”权的法律，建立所谓“半自治共和国”。但是，这种把戏是骗不了人的。法属西非洲的人民继续进行了民族独立斗争。
    尼日尔的面积有一百二十余万平方公里，人口约二百多万。1904年被法国侵占。尼日尔的人民近年来争取独立的斗争也日益高涨。今年9月初在首府尼亚美召开的非洲人民联盟尼日尔委员会萨瓦巴成立大会通过了要求马上独立的决议。
