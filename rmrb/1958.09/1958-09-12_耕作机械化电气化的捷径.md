A Shortcut to Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification

    Recently, the people in various parts of Jiangsu Province have displayed great creativity and manufactured various types of rope-traction machines for plowing fields, with very good results. Staff members of the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, based on the principle of the wind-powered rope-traction machine in Jiangsu Province, have recently successfully trial-produced an electric rope-traction machine (referred to as "electric plow"). The results of the experiments have proven that it has a high efficiency in plowing fields. The emergence of these rope-traction machines is a major event in China's agricultural technology revolution and will be a great boost to China's agricultural mechanization and electrification.

    What are the advantages of rope-traction machines? There are many advantages. First, most of the power of this machine can be used to pull the plow, unlike tractors, which consume a large part of the power in their own operation. The traction efficiency of the electric rope-traction machine manufactured by the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute (referring to the ratio of horsepower actually used to drag farm implements to the horsepower of the tractor engine) can reach a minimum of 70% to 80%. The traction efficiency of tractors is only 30% to 40%. Compared with tractors, electric rope-traction machines are about twice as efficient in dry fields and twice as efficient in paddy fields. Generally, a tractor can only plow about two-tenths of an acre per horsepower per hour, while an electric rope-traction machine can plow more than four-tenths of an acre. The efficiency of manual rope-traction machines is also quite high. For example, in Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, manual rope-traction machines are used to deeply plow carrot fields. Three or four people can operate one, and they can plow three to four acres a day, averaging about one acre per person. The plowing efficiency of one manual rope-traction machine is equivalent to that of five oxen.

    Second, rope-traction machines are highly adaptable to various natural conditions and are suitable for paddy fields, mud fields, irrigated fields, swamp lands, and smaller plots of land in mountainous and hilly areas. They can be used in sunny or rainy weather, day or night.

    Third, they can plow deeply. In Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province, a rope-traction machine driven by an internal combustion engine pulling a double-furrow plow can plow more than eight and a half inches deep, and the depth can be further increased. In Wuqing County, Hebei Province, electric plows were tested, and they could plow one and a half acres per hour, with a depth of 15 to 25 centimeters and a plowing width of 18 centimeters. In Taixing County, manual rope-traction machines are used to plow fields, generally to a depth of one foot and two inches to one foot and five inches.

    Fourth, the operation is simple and can greatly improve the labor conditions of farmers. Rural people who know how to operate ordinary machines can quickly master the operation technology of electric and internal combustion engine-driven rope-traction machines after a short period of study and training. As for manual and animal-powered rope-traction machines, they are even easier to operate. When operating an electric rope-traction machine, people do not have to follow behind the plow or go into the water, but only control the button on the shore. When using manual or animal-powered rope-traction machines to plow fields, people do not have to follow behind the plow either.

    Fifth, when using electric rope-traction machines to plow fields, under the same conditions, the operating cost is only about one-third of the operating cost of tractors. The weight of a general tractor is more than one ton, and large ones even weigh several tons. Manufacturing tractors also requires high-grade steel. The electric rope-traction machine trial-produced by the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute has a simple structure. In addition to the motor and electromagnetic switch, it only has a few simple parts such as a winch, steel wire rope, and control lever. The entire set of parts weighs only more than 80 kilograms, and the cost is only more than 500 yuan, which is about 150 yuan per horsepower. The structure of manual and animal-powered rope-traction machines is even simpler. In addition to steel wire ropes, hemp ropes, cotton threads, and palm leaf ropes can also be used to replace the traction ropes, which makes the manufacturing cost even lower. The manual rope-traction machine manufactured in Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, only costs 30 yuan per unit.

    Sixth, rope-traction machines are small in size and will not compress the soil like tractors. This is especially important for paddy fields.

    Of course, the newly born rope-traction machines still have some shortcomings that need to be further tested, researched, and improved. And we do not mean to belittle tractors (tractors have other functions). However, in any case, the outstanding advantages that this machine has already shown should be affirmed. Since rope-traction machines can drive plows to plow fields, we can also study using them to drive other machines to carry out other field operations. Therefore, this machine has great value for promotion.

    The emergence of rope-traction machines has shattered people's mysterious views on agricultural mechanization and electrification. It makes people realize that agricultural mechanization and electrification are not unattainable, nor are they matters of the distant future. We can start doing it now. To achieve agricultural mechanization and electrification, it is not necessary to have the kind of complex, difficult-to-manufacture, material-consuming, and expensive large machines. Universally promoting simple, easy-to-manufacture, material-saving, and money-saving rope-traction machines will be a shortcut to accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification under China's specific conditions.

    At present, there is a widespread feeling of labor shortage in rural areas. This is an acute contradiction in China's high-speed development of agricultural production. The fundamental solution to this contradiction is to achieve agricultural mechanization and electrification and greatly develop social productivity. At present, in addition to the universal promotion of agricultural tool reform and improved agricultural tools, and first realizing the ball bearingization of transportation tools, it is also necessary to try to manufacture and promote various economical and applicable new agricultural machinery as much as possible. This year, the wheat planting area in various provinces and regions will be expanded unprecedentedly, and deep plowing will be carried out universally. Under this situation, mass production of ball bearings and active manufacturing and promotion of rope-traction machines are even more important. Jiangsu Province plans to deeply plow 50 million mu of land for autumn planting this year. If it takes 15 people to plow one mu of land, it will require 750 million man-days of labor. If 10 million people are mobilized every day, it will take 75 days to complete the task. If manual rope-traction machines are used to deeply plow the land, with one person plowing one mu, and the same 10 million people are mobilized every day, the task can be completed in five days, saving the province 700 million man-days of labor. If power-driven rope-traction machines are used, even more labor will be saved.

    Are the conditions for mass manufacturing and promoting rope-traction machines available in various places? It should be said that the conditions are available. Rope-traction machines can be driven by engines, making plowing operations completely mechanized, or they can be driven by human, animal, or wind power, making plowing operations semi-mechanized. At present, all counties have more or less power drainage and irrigation machinery and agricultural product processing machinery. If these power machinery are fully utilized to drive rope-traction machines to plow fields, some counties may achieve agricultural mechanization and electrification ahead of schedule. Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, which has more power machinery, has 100 electric motors and 600 water pumps. If all of them are used as power machinery for rope-traction machines, the county can achieve agricultural mechanization without a single tractor. Of course, the conditions in most counties in the country may not be as good as those in Wuxi County. Therefore, in addition to finding ways to fully utilize the existing rural power machinery, manual and animal-powered rope-traction machines should be manufactured and promoted on a large scale, that is, semi-mechanization should be realized first. In particular, in paddy field areas, greater efforts should be made to do this, so that plowing in paddy field areas can quickly realize semi-mechanization, mechanization, and electrification.

    耕作机械化电气化的捷径
    最近时期江苏省各地人民发挥高度的创造性，制成了各种各式的绳索牵引机械，用以耕田，效果很好。中国农业科学院农业机械化研究所的工作人员根据江苏省风力绳索牵引机的原理，在最近试制成功一种电力绳索牵引机（简称电犁）。试验的结果证明耕田效率很高。这些绳索牵引机的出现，是我国农业技术革命中的一件大事，对于我国的农业机械化和电气化事业将是一个很大的推动。
    绳索牵引机有些什么优点呢？优点很多。第一，这种机械的绝大部分动力都可以用来牵引犁头，不像拖拉机那样把很大一部分动力消耗在它本身的运转中。北京农业机械化研究所制造的电力绳索牵引机的牵引效率（指实际用在拖动农具上的马力与拖拉机发动机马力的比值），最低可达百分之七十到八十。而拖拉机的牵引效率却只有百分之三十到四十。电力绳索牵引机跟拖拉机比较，在旱田里效率大约要高一倍，在水田里要高两倍。一般拖拉机每马力一小时只能耕地二分左右，而电力绳索牵引机却能耕四分以上。人力绳索牵引机的效率也相当高。如江苏省泰兴县用人力绳索牵引机深耕胡萝卜田，三、四人操作，一天可耕三至四亩，平均大约一人耕一亩。一部人力绳索牵引机的耕田效率相当于五头耕牛。
    第二，绳索牵引机对各种自然条件的适应性很强，在水田、沤田、水浇地、沼泽地以及山区、丘陵区的较小块土地上都适用。不论晴天或雨天、白天或黑夜，都可以耕作。
    第三，能深耕。江苏省奉贤县用内燃机带动的绳索牵引机牵引双铧犁可深耕八寸半以上，深度还可以继续增加。河北省武清县试用电犁耕田，每小时可耕地一亩半，深度十五至二十五公分，耕宽十八公分。泰兴县用人力绳索牵引机耕田，普遍可深耕一尺二寸到一尺五寸。
    第四，操作简便，可以大大改善农民的劳动条件。农村里会开普通机器的人经过短期学习训练，就能很快地掌握电力的和内燃机带动的绳索牵引机的操作技术。至于人力、畜力的绳索牵引机就更容易操纵。操纵电力绳索牵引机的时候，人不必跟在犁头后面，也不必下水，只在岸上控制电钮就行了。用人力或畜力绳索牵引机械耕田，犁头后面也可以不跟人。
    第五，采用电力绳索牵引机耕田，在相同的条件下，作业费用只占拖拉机作业费用的三分之一左右。一般拖拉机的体重都在一吨以上，大型的甚至有好几吨重。制造拖拉机又需要高级钢材。农业机械化研究所试制的电力绳索牵引机结构简单，除电动机、电磁开关外，只有绞盘、钢丝绳、控制杆等几个简单机件，全套机件总共只有八十多公斤，成本只有五百多元，合每马力一百五十元左右。人力和畜力绳索牵引机的构造更简单，牵引绳索除了用钢丝绳外，还可以用麻绳、棉线、棕叶绳等代替，这样制造成本就更低了。江苏省泰兴县制造的人力绳索牵引机，每部只需三十元的成本。
    第六，绳索牵引机体积小，不会像拖拉机那样压地。这对于水田是特别重要的。
    当然刚刚诞生的绳索牵引机械，还有某些缺点，需要进一步试验研究改善。而且我们也没有贬低拖拉机的意思（拖拉机还有另外一些功能）。但是，不论怎样，这种机械已经显示出来的突出优点是应该肯定的。既然绳索牵引机能带动犁头耕田，也可以研究用它带动别的机具进行别的田间作业。因此，这种机械有很大的推广的价值。
    绳索牵引机的出现，打破了人们对于农业机械化、电气化的神秘观点。它使人们认识到：农业机械化、电气化并不是高不可攀的，也不是遥远的将来的事情，我们现在就能够动手干起来。实现农业机械化、电气化，并不一定非有那种复杂难造、费料费钱的大机器不可。普遍推广简单易造、省料省钱的绳索牵引机，将是在我国的具体条件下加速实现农业机械化、电气化的一条捷径。
    目前农村中普遍感到劳动力不足，这是我国高速度地发展农业生产中的一个尖锐的矛盾。解决这个矛盾的根本办法，是实现农业机械化、电气化，极大地发展社会生产力。在目前来说，除了要普遍推行农具改革，推广改良农具，首先实现运转工具的滚珠轴承化以外，还需要尽可能试制和推广各种经济、适用的新的农业机械。今年各省区的小麦种植面积将空前地扩大，还要普遍进行深翻地。在这种情况下，大造滚珠轴承，并且积极制造和推广绳索牵引机，就更加重要了。江苏省今年秋种土地要深翻五千万亩，如按十五个人工翻一亩地计算，需要七亿五千万个人工；如果每天出动一千万人工，就需要七十五天才能完成任务。如果采用人力绳索牵引机深翻地，以一个人工翻一亩计算，同样一天出动一千万个人工，五天就可以全部完成深翻地任务，全省可以节省七亿个人工。如果采用动力机械带动的绳索牵引机，节约的人工就更多了。
    目前各地是否具备了大量制造推广绳索牵引机的条件呢？应当说条件是具备的。绳索牵引机可以用发动机带动，使耕田作业完全机械化，也可以用人力、畜力、风力带动，使耕田作业半机械化。现在各县都有或多或少的动力排灌机械和农产品加工机械，如果充分利用这些动力机械带动绳索牵引机耕田，某些县就可能提早实现农业机械化和电气化。拥有动力机械较多的江苏省无锡县全县有电动机一百部、戽水机六百部，如果全部用来做绳索牵引机的动力机械，全县不需要一部拖拉机就可以实现农业机械化。当然，全国大多数县目前的条件可能不如无锡县，因此，除了设法充分利用现有的农村动力机械以外，应当大量制造和推广人力、畜力的绳索牵引机，即首先实现半机械化。特别是水田地区，应当用更大的努力来做这件事，使水田地区的耕作迅速实现半机械化、机械化和电气化。
