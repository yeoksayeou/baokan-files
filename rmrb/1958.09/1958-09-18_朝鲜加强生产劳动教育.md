Xinhua News Agency: In the new school year, North Korea will further strengthen labor education and basic production technology education in schools throughout the country. In the past few years since the war, North Korean university students have participated in construction work for one to forty days each year under the principle of not affecting their studies. This year, North Korean university students participated in basic construction projects such as blast furnaces, power stations, and coal mines, and they provided 300,000 man-days for the construction of Pyongyang.
　　In order to cultivate both red and expert talents, among the new students admitted to universities this year, more than 80% are workers, cadres, and demobilized soldiers who have participated in labor and work for two or three years. At the same time, most of this year's high school graduates will first participate in labor.

    朝鲜加强生产劳动教育
    据新华社讯　在新学年中，朝鲜各地学校的劳动教育和基本生产技术教育，将进一步加强。朝鲜的大学生在战后几年来每年都在不影响学习的原则下参加一个月到四十天的建设工作。今年，朝鲜的大学生参加了高炉、发电站、煤矿等基本建设工程，他们为平壤市的建设提供了三十万个人工。
    为了培养又红又专的人材，各大学在今年新学年吸收的新生中，参加过劳动和工作两三年的职工、干部和复员军人占80％以上。同时，今年毕业的高中毕业生的大部分都要先去参加劳动。
