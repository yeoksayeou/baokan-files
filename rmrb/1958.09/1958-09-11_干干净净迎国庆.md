Greet the National Day Cleanly and Neatly

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued a decision to continue carrying out the Four Pests Elimination Campaign, and requires all localities to universally hold a large-scale Four Pests Elimination Campaign before the National Day, to clean up and greet the National Day.

Eliminating the Four Pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating diseases, as stated in the Central Committee's decision, is "a fundamental and important measure to enhance people's physical fitness, protect labor power, and improve labor efficiency." Since the launch of the patriotic health campaign centered on the elimination of the Four Pests last winter, tremendous achievements have been made across the country. According to statistics from the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, as of September 9th, more than 1.51 billion rats, 1.55 billion sparrows, 74.4 million kilograms of flies, and 8.6 million kilograms of mosquitoes have been eliminated nationwide. Various localities have also successively established 812 basically Four-Pest-Free counties (cities) (including 698 counties and 114 cities). By the beginning of August, 3.96 billion tons of garbage had been cleared, 55.3 billion tons of manure accumulated, 1.45 million kilometers of ditches dredged, 60 million toilets built, 26.94 million livestock pens constructed, and 2.46 million wells improved nationwide. The sanitary conditions in vast urban and rural areas have greatly improved, and hygiene has become a habit for the majority of people in many places. The incidence of many of the most harmful diseases has generally decreased, and the number of absenteeism due to illness has greatly reduced in various localities. Comparing the incidence rate from January to June of this year with the same period last year, the incidence rates of malaria, dysentery, typhus, measles, poliomyelitis, cerebrospinal meningitis, and diphtheria have decreased by a minimum of 12% and a maximum of 73%. In ethnic minority areas, all places where the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the Four Pests has been carried out have also achieved remarkable results. For example, comparing the incidence rates of various diseases in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region from January to June this year with the same period last year, the incidence rate of typhus decreased by 96%, dysentery decreased by more than 12%, typhoid fever decreased by 25%, scarlet fever decreased by 89%, and epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis decreased by more than 64%. Furthermore, some areas, such as Jiangsu, Shandong, and Hebei provinces, have completely eliminated kala-azar throughout the province, and Hebei province has basically eliminated current cases of syphilis. Hunan, Henan, Guangxi, Shanxi, and Zhejiang have seen a special zone and nineteen counties (cities) that are basically malaria-free. Some production units have not had any absenteeism due to illness throughout the entire month or quarter, and everyone is energetic and full of vigor. Significant progress has been made in the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. As of August 5th, more than 2.074 million schistosomiasis patients have been treated nationwide, and snails have been eliminated over an area of 2.13 billion square meters. Fourteen basically snail-free counties and cities have emerged, along with 810 basically snail-free townships, 96 counties and cities that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis, and 297 townships (towns) that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis. Moreover, seven counties and cities, including Yugan and Wuyuan in Jiangxi, Zengcheng in Guangdong, and Gucheng and Xiangyang in Hubei, have completely eradicated schistosomiasis. All these achievements fully demonstrate the great role of the Four Pests Elimination and Hygiene Promotion Campaign in "changing customs and transforming the country."

An old gentleman in Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, composed a short ballad to praise the new look of local hygiene, saying: "From afar, the villages look spotlessly white, up close, they are all like miniature Beijings, the homes are decorated like bridal chambers, the wells are like crystal palaces, everyone is healthy and the livestock are thriving, and the songs of the Great Leap Forward echo throughout the countryside." This is also a reflection of the new look of health work after it has been done well across the country. The achievements we have already made on the Four Pests Elimination front are undoubtedly unprecedentedly great, but compared with the requirement of eliminating the Four Pests and eliminating diseases nationwide, the work is only just beginning. Moreover, because the reproduction rate of the Four Pests is very high, they disappear today after being exterminated, but if we relax even slightly, they will breed again. In the previous period of the campaign, even in places where the work was done best and the Four Pests have been basically eliminated, great efforts are still needed to completely eliminate the Four Pests. And from the national situation, counties (cities) that have basically eliminated the Four Pests account for only 36.2% of the total number of counties (cities) in the country. In the other 63.8% of the counties (cities), the campaign has been carried out very slowly in many places, and there are still dead spots. Furthermore, in some places that had previously achieved basic "Four-Pest-Free" status, the Four Pests have rebounded due to relaxed efforts, and all previous efforts have been abandoned! In these places where the Four Pests Elimination Campaign has not been carried out or has not been carried out well, the activities of the Four Pests are still rampant, and diseases continue to threaten people's health, affecting the leap forward in production. The situation in these places stands in stark contrast to the advanced areas in the Four Pests Elimination and Hygiene Promotion Campaign.

Why has the Four Pests Elimination and Hygiene Promotion Campaign been carried out well in most parts of the country, while it has not been carried out well in some places? The fundamental point of divergence lies in whether the masses have been truly, widely, and deeply mobilized. Due to cultural backwardness in our country, the broad masses of people lack health science knowledge and are superstitious about ghosts, gods, and feng shui. Although this is the biggest difficulty on the Four Pests Elimination front, as long as the Party and government leaders pay attention to it, put politics in command, and break the various superstitious ideas of the masses through methods such as recalling, comparing, calculating accounts, complaining about sufferings, discussing, and debating, combined with the promotion of health knowledge, the masses will quickly act and march towards the Four Pests. After the masses are universally mobilized, they will be full of energy and develop collective wisdom, and many simple and effective indigenous and foreign methods for eliminating the Four Pests will be created. In places where the Four Pests Elimination and Hygiene Promotion Campaign has not been carried out well, it is precisely because of the lack of widespread and in-depth ideological education that the masses do not have a sufficient understanding of the harm of the Four Pests, and their determination to eliminate the Four Pests is not great, so the effect will naturally not be good.

Why has widespread and in-depth ideological education on the Four Pests Elimination not been carried out among the masses? This is because many comrades still have right-leaning conservative ideas about the Four Pests Elimination. People with right-leaning conservative ideas do not deeply understand that the Four Pests Elimination is a major issue related to the immediate interests of the masses and the socialist construction of the country. They cannot fully recognize the urgent demands of the broad masses for the Four Pests Elimination, and of course they cannot see the huge power and creativity of the mobilized masses. Although they verbally admit that the Four Pests can be eliminated, when exactly can they be eliminated? They themselves feel very vague about this question. At the beginning of the campaign, they used various "bases" to say that the Four Pests are "difficult to eliminate," that the countryside is more difficult than the city, and that the mountainous areas are simply too difficult to imagine. After the masses in many places came up with ways to eliminate rats and sparrows on a large scale and achieved significant results, they were educated by the facts, but then they emphasized that flies and mosquitoes are difficult to eliminate. When basically Four-Pest-Free counties (cities) appeared one after another, their "difficult-to-eliminate theory" and "skepticism" were completely shattered, but then they one-sidedly emphasized that production is busy, opposed production to the Four Pests Elimination, and only cared about production, neglecting or rarely caring about the Four Pests Elimination. Of course, eliminating the Four Pests while producing is much more intense in terms of time and manpower than just focusing on production. But this does not lead to the conclusion that hygiene work cannot be done when production is busy. On the contrary, the more intense the production, the more necessary it is to do a good job in hygiene and enhance physical fitness. Some local people have put forward the slogan "No disease is the capital of combat, and health is the guarantee of the leap forward," which is completely correct. And precisely because the Four Pests Elimination serves production, as long as the leadership pays attention to it and uniformly arranges labor and time, conflicts can be avoided. Various localities have created rich experience in this regard. As long as the masses are truly mobilized, many good methods can be created according to the time and place.

The complacency and self-satisfaction of some cadres and the masses are also obstacles to the in-depth development of the Four Pests Elimination and Hygiene Promotion Campaign. In these places, due to a lack of attention to the breeding patterns of the Four Pests, after initially achieving some results, they thought that "it was almost enough," resulting in the Four Pests breeding and multiplying again, not only failing to move forward but also abandoning all previous efforts. This must also be resolutely corrected.

Now is autumn. Autumn is also the season for the Four Pests to breed and be rampant, and it is also the season for the high incidence of many of the most harmful diseases such as malaria, dysentery, and encephalitis. It is also the decisive season for whether this year's national Four Pests Elimination Campaign can achieve a comprehensive victory. All localities must seize this opportunity, and on the basis of a national inspection, further widely and deeply carry out propaganda and education, improve the masses' understanding of the significance of carrying out the Four Pests Elimination Campaign, overcome various incorrect ideas, and mobilize everyone to be full of energy and strive for the best on the Four Pests Elimination front. Some advanced areas should carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution and continuously enrich new content such as public health in people's communes, factories, canteens, and nurseries, in accordance with the requirements of local production and cultural and educational development, and improve the quality of the campaign. Areas where the campaign is progressing slowly or has not yet been opened up should also learn lessons, absorb advanced experience, and catch up with the advanced. In order to promote the current Four Pests Elimination and Hygiene Promotion Campaign to leap forward with the Great Leap Forward in production, all localities across the country should take it as a regular task and not relax during busy farming seasons. At the same time, on the basis of regularization, they should mobilize the masses to launch surprise campaigns by taking advantage of free time from production and festivals. The National Day is approaching, and all localities across the country should take this opportunity to launch a surprise campaign to eliminate the Four Pests and promote hygiene, so that everyone can clean up and greet this great festival.

    干干净净迎国庆
    中共中央已经发出了继续展开除四害运动的决定，并且要求各地在国庆节前普遍举行一次大规模的除四害运动，打扫得干干净净，迎接国庆。
    除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病，正如中央的决定中所说的，是“增强人民体质、保护劳动力、提高劳动效率的一项带根本性的重要措施”。全国各地自去冬开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动以来，已经获得了巨大的成绩。据中央爱国卫生运动委员会的统计，到9月9日，全国已灭鼠十五亿一千多万只，雀十五亿五千多万只，蝇七千四百多万公斤，蚊八百六十多万公斤，各地并且先后出现了基本四无县（市）八百十二个（包括六百九十八个县，一百十四个市）。到8月上旬为止，全国已清除垃圾三十九亿六千万吨，积肥五百五十三亿吨，疏通沟渠一百四十五万公里，修建厕所六千万个，修建牲畜圈窝二千六百九十四万个，改良水井二百四十六万个。广大城乡的卫生面貌大大改观，讲卫生在许多地方已经成为广大人民的习惯，许多危害最严重的疾病的发病率，普遍地降低，各地因病缺勤的人数大大减少。如以今年一到六月份的发病率，与去年同时期来比较，则疟疾、痢疾、斑疹伤寒、麻疹、瘠髓灰白质炎、脑瘠髓膜炎、白喉的发病率，最少的降低了12％，最多的降低了73％。在少数民族地区，凡是开展除四害爱国卫生运动的地方，也都获得了显著的成效。如内蒙古自治区今年1至6月份各种疾病发病率与去年同时期的比较，斑疹伤寒的患病率降低了96％，痢疾降低了12％以上，伤寒降低了25％，猩红热病降低了89％，流行性脑瘠髓膜炎降低了64％以上。甚至，有些地区如江苏、山东、河北等省全省已消灭了黑热病，河北全省已基本消灭了现症梅毒，湖南、河南、广西、山西、浙江已出现了一个专区及十九个县（市）基本无疟疾，有些生产单位在全月份、全季度内都没有发现因病缺勤的人，而且人人精神爽利，精力充沛。血吸虫病的防治工作，已经收到显著的成效。到8月5日止，全国已治疗血吸虫病人二百零七万四千多人，灭螺二十一亿三千多万平方公尺，出现基本无螺县、市十四个，基本无螺乡八百一十个，基本消灭血吸虫病的县市九十六个，基本消灭血吸虫病乡（镇）二百九十七个，并且出现了江西的余干、婺源，广东的增城，湖北的谷城、襄阳等七个根除血吸虫病县市。所有这些成绩的取得，充分体现了除四害、讲卫生运动“移风易俗、改造国家”的伟大作用。
    山西省屯留县有一位老先生编了一段歌谣歌颂当地卫生的新面貌说：“远看村村白生生，近看都是小北京，家里粉饰像洞房，水井好比水晶宫，人人健壮六畜兴，跃进歌声遍村野”，这也是全国各地卫生工作搞好以后的新面貌的写照。我们在除四害战线上已经取得的成绩无疑是空前巨大的，但是对照在全国范围内除尽四害、消灭疾病的要求来说，工作仅仅是开始，而且，由于四害的孳生繁殖率很高，今天打得看不见了，稍一放松，它们又繁殖起来。在前一时期运动中，即便是工作做得最好，已经基本消灭四害的地方，要彻底地消灭四害还要作很大的努力。而从全国的情况来说，已经基本消灭四害的县（市），也只占到全国县（市）总数的36.2％，在其他为数占全国总数63.8％的县（市）中，有不少地方运动开展得还很缓慢，还存在有死角。甚至，有些曾经做到基本“四无”的地方，由于工作放松，结果四害回生，又前功尽弃！在这些除四害运动没有开展或是开展得不好的地方，四害的活动还很猖獗，疾病仍然威胁着人们的健康，影响生产的跃进。这些地方的情况，与除四害讲卫生工作先进地区的情况，恰恰形成显明的对照。
    全国绝大部分地区的除四害、讲卫生运动为什么开展得好？而有些地方却开展得不好呢？其根本的分歧点，就在于是否真正广泛而深入地发动了群众。我国由于文化落后，广大人民缺乏卫生科学知识，迷信鬼神、风水。这虽是除四害战线上的最大困难，但是只要党政领导重视，政治挂帅，通过回忆、对比、算账、诉苦、讨论和辩论等方法，并结合着宣传卫生知识，打破群众各种迷信思想，群众就迅速地行动起来，向四害进军。群众普遍地发动起来以后，鼓足干劲，发扬集体智慧，很多简便有效的除四害的土办法、洋办法就会创造出来。而在除四害、讲卫生运动没很好开展的地方，正因为缺乏广泛而深入的思想教育，群众对四害的害处认识不足，肃清四害的决心也就不大，效果当然就不会好。
    为什么没有广泛而深入地对群众进行除四害的思想教育呢？这是因为还有不少同志对除四害存在着右倾保守思想。有右倾保守思想的人，没有深刻认识到除四害是关系到群众切身利益，和关涉到国家的社会主义建设事业的重大问题，不能充分认识广大群众对除四害的迫切要求，当然也看不到群众发动起来的巨大力量和创造性。他们虽然口头上也承认四害可以除尽，可是究竟什么时候能除尽？他们自己对这个问题也感到很渺茫。在运动开始的时候，他们以种种“根据”，说四害“难除”，说农村比城市更难，山区简直难到不敢想像。在许多地方群众想出了大片消灭鼠、雀办法，并且获得了显著的成绩以后，他们在事实面前受到了教育，但又强调蝇、蚊难除。等到基本四无县（市）接连地出现了，他们的“难除论”和“怀疑论”全部被打破了，但是他们又在片面地强调生产忙，把生产与除四害对立起来，只管生产，不管或者很少管除四害。当然，一面生产，一面除四害，这比起只搞生产，在时间和人力方面要紧张得多。但是并不能因此得出结论，说生产忙了，不能搞卫生工作。而事实恰恰相反，越是生产紧张，就越需要搞好卫生工作，增强体质，有些地方群众提出口号说：“无病是战斗的资本，健康是跃进的保证”，这是完全正确的。而正因为除四害就是为生产服务，只要由领导上注意，统一地安排劳动力和时间，是可以不发生矛盾的。各地在这方面已创造出丰富的经验。只要把群众真正地发动起来，就可以因时因地的创造出许多好的办法。
    有些干部和群众的麻痹自满思想，也是深入开展除四害、讲卫生运动的障碍。在这些地方，由于对四害的繁殖规律不注意研究，在初步获得了一些成绩以后，就认为“差不多了”，结果又让四害孳生繁殖起来，不但不能前进，反而前功尽弃。这也是必须切实纠正的。
    现在是秋季了。秋季也是四害孳生繁殖和猖獗活动的季节，是疟疾、痢疾、脑炎等许多危害最严重的疾病的多发病季节，也是今年全国除四害运动能否取得全面胜利的决战季节。各地必须抓住这一时机，在全国大检查的基础上，进一步广泛而深入地进行宣传教育，提高群众对开展除四害运动意义的认识，克服各种不正确的思想，发动人人在除四害战线上都鼓足干劲，力争上游。一些先进地区应当发扬不断革命的精神，根据当地生产和文教事业发展的要求，不断丰富如人民公社、工厂、食堂、托儿所等公共卫生的新内容，提高运动的质量。而运动开展较缓慢或尚没有打开局面的地方，也应接受教训，吸取先进经验，迎头赶上先进。为了推动当前除四害、讲卫生运动随着生产大跃进而跃进，全国各地都应该把它作为经常性的工作，在农忙时也不放松；同时，在经常化的基础上，利用生产的空闲和节日等有利时机，发动群众展开突击性的运动。国庆节快到了，全国各地都应当利用这个机会开展一次除四害讲卫生突击运动，让大家打扫得干干净净，迎接这个伟大的节日。
