Xinhua News Agency, September 5th, Montevideo: The Uruguayan Communist Party's newspaper "El Popular" consecutively published in May this year a speech delivered by its editor-in-chief, Eduardo Viera, at a rally commemorating Lenin. This speech narrated Lenin's contributions to Marxism and criticized modern revisionism, particularly the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

　　While criticizing the Yugoslav modern revisionists, Viera pointed out that Lenin had repeatedly cautioned that the fundamental principles of communism must be correctly adapted to the specific circumstances of nations and countries. However, the creative application of Marxism-Leninism has nothing in common with revisionism.

　　Viera said: A specific form of socialism is one thing; so-called "national communism" is another. The latter can only originate from the ideological arsenal of imperialism.

　　Viera said that the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is not merely a study of the situation in Yugoslavia, but also raises principled issues concerning the entire international communist movement.

　　Viera pointed out that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia signed the Peace Manifesto signed by all Communist and Workers' Parties, which clearly stated that the threat to peace comes from capitalist monopoly organizations and imperialist powers led by the United States. Viera said that, despite this, the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia equates the foreign policies of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp with the foreign policies of the imperialist camp. This program asserts that the current international situation is a product of the existence of two opposing blocs vying for spheres of influence and pursuing war policies.

　　Viera pointed out that the "neutralist" theory of the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia violates proletarian internationalism and the task of socialist countries to support each other and unite against imperialist provocations to ensure peace.

　　Viera continued that those anti-Marxist theories are connected with other equally erroneous theories, namely the theory about the nature of capitalist states, and the theory about the socialist components fabricated in the state-capitalist guise worn by capitalist large monopoly organizations. He also pointed out that the program's state doctrine regarding those countries where the dictatorship of the proletariat has already triumphed is also wrong, and the program also crudely distorts the role of the Communist Party.

　　Viera refuted the claim by the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia that the criticism of its program is so-called interference in Yugoslavia's internal affairs. He pointed out that they have presented a program to the Communist Parties of all countries, but want these Communist Parties to remain silent about the revisionist content contained in this program. If so, that would be refusing to defend Marxism-Leninism and refusing to oppose the distortion of Marxism-Leninism.

### 南共纲领歪曲马克思主义  各国共产党不能保持缄默  乌共机关报社长批判现代修正主义

　　南共纲领歪曲马克思主义
    各国共产党不能保持缄默
    乌共机关报社长批判现代修正主义
    新华社5日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭共产党机关报“人民报”在今年5月连续刊载了该报社长爱德华多·维埃拉在一次纪念列宁的集会上发表的演说。这篇演说叙述了列宁对马克思主义的贡献，同时批判了现代修正主义特别是批判了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领。
    维埃拉在批判南斯拉夫现代修正主义者时指出，列宁曾经多次告诫，必须使共产主义的基本原则正确地适应于民族和国家的特殊情况。但是，创造性地运用马克思列宁主义同修正主义毫无共同之处。
    维埃拉说：社会主义的特殊形式是一件事情，所谓“民族共产主义”是另一件事。后者只能出自帝国主义的思想武库。
    维埃拉说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领不仅仅是对南斯拉夫情况的研究，而且提出了涉及整个国际共产主义运动的原则性问题。
    维埃拉指出，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟在各国共产党和工人党都签了字的和平宣言上签了字，在这个宣言中明确指出，对和平的威胁来自资本主义垄断组织和以美国为首的帝国主义大国。维埃拉说，尽管如此，在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领中却把苏联和社会主义阵营的对外政策同帝国主义阵营的对外政策相提并论。这个纲领断言，目前的国际形势是争夺势力范围和执行战争政策的两个对立集团存在的产物。
    维埃拉指出，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导集团的“中立主义的”理论违背了无产阶级国际主义，违背了社会主义国家的互相支援以及联合起来反对帝国主义的挑衅以保障和平的任务。
    维埃拉接着说，那些反马克思主义的理论同另外一些同样错误的理论是联系着的，即关于资本主义国家的国家性质的理论，关于由资本主义大垄断组织所披的国家资本主义外衣中臆造出来的社会主义成分的理论。他还指出，这个纲领中关于那些无产阶级专政已经胜利了的国家的国家学说也是错误的，这个纲领还粗暴地歪曲了共产党的作用。
    维埃拉驳斥了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导集团把对它的纲领的批判说成是所谓干涉南斯拉夫内政的说法。他指出，他们对各国共产党提出了一个纲领，而又要这些共产党对这个纲领所包含的修正主义内容缄口不言。如果这样，那就是拒绝捍卫马克思列宁主义，拒绝反对对马克思列宁主义的曲解。
