Good on Top of Good

The Shanghai Third Steel Plant, which has the highest open hearth utilization coefficient, has created nine new records for rapid steelmaking in four days. The Dalian Steel Plant, which ranks among the top in electric furnace utilization coefficient, also set a new national record on the 17th. It is truly good on top of good.

There used to be a theory that it is difficult to improve further once production has reached a certain level. The reason is that when production reaches a certain level, all aspects of work are relatively advanced, and there is not much potential left. The fact that the red flag of the Shanghai Third Steel Plant and the Dalian Steel Plant is raised higher and higher proves that this theory is untenable. There is potential in the backward links of production, and there is also potential in the advanced parts of production. Advanced production, skilled technology, and tight organization can discover problems that others cannot discover and tap into potentials that could not be tapped in the past. Isn't this obvious?

So, why are some enterprises that used to be relatively advanced in production not leaping forward so quickly? Perhaps it is precisely this "theory" that "it is difficult to improve further once production has reached a certain level" that has bound them. If the fighting spirit is not high in the first place, of course the progress will not be fast. This requires liberating the mind, like the Shanghai Third Steel Plant and the Dalian Steel Plant, showing a revolutionary spirit, winning one victory, and then winning another victory.

### 好上加好

    好上加好
    平炉利用系数首屈一指的上海第三钢厂，又在四天中先后九次创造快速炼钢新纪录，电炉利用系数名列前茅的大连钢厂，也在17日再创全国最高纪录。真所谓好上加好。
    曾经有这样一种论调：生产发展到一定的水平，再要提高就很困难。理由是生产发展到一定的水平，各方面的工作都比较先进，就没有多少潜力了。上钢三厂和大连钢厂红旗越举越高的事实，证明这种论调是站不住脚的。生产落后的环节有潜力，生产先进的部分也有潜力。生产先进，技术熟练，组织严密，就能发现别人不能发现的问题，挖出过去不能挖出的潜力，这不是显而易见的吗？
    那么，为什么有些过去生产比较先进的企业确实跃进得不那么快呢？恐怕正是这种“生产发展到一定的水平，再要提高就很困难”的“理论”把他们束缚住了。先就斗志不高，当然进度不快，这就需要解放思想，像上钢三厂和大连钢厂一样，拿出革命的精神来，打了一个胜仗，再打一个胜仗。
