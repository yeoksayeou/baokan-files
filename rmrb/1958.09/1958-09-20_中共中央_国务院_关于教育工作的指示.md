Instructions of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on Education Work
September 19, 1958

*Key Points*

Cultivating a contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert is one of the great historical tasks of the entire Party and the people of the whole country. Unite the whole Party and all education workers who can be united to overcome right-leaning and dogmatic thinking in education work. The Party's education policy is that education serves proletarian politics, and education is combined with productive labor. To realize this policy, education work must be led by the Party. In all schools, Marxist-Leninist political and ideological education must be carried out to cultivate the working-class class viewpoint, mass viewpoint, collective viewpoint, labor viewpoint (the combination of mental and manual labor), and dialectical materialism viewpoint among teachers and students. The future direction is for schools to run factories and farms, and for factories and agricultural cooperatives to run schools. We must adopt the principle of combining unity and diversity, combining popularization and improvement, and combining overall planning and local decentralization. Each major collaboration zone should establish a complete education system based on its actual conditions and needs. Running education should be under the leadership of the Party Committee, combining professional education workers with the masses, adopting the mass line method of coming from the masses and going to the masses, and implementing education by the whole Party and the whole people. We will use about fifteen years to popularize higher education, and then another fifteen years or so to engage in improvement work.

(1) The socialist revolution on the economic front has achieved a basic victory, the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has achieved a decisive victory, and a great leap forward has emerged in socialist construction in terms of industrial and agricultural production. In order to thoroughly complete the socialist revolution, to meet the needs of socialist construction, and to realize the grand goal of communism, it is necessary to "actively carry out technological revolution and cultural revolution while continuing the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts." (Resolution of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China) With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the cultural revolution has begun to enter a climax, mainly manifested in the rapid development of the nationwide literacy campaign, education, and various cultural undertakings. Correctly leading education work, adhering to the Party's education policy, opposing right-leaning and dogmatic thinking, mobilizing all positive factors, going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in eliminating illiteracy, popularizing education, and cultivating a contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert is one of the great historical tasks of the entire Party and the people of the whole country.

(2) Since the liberation of the whole country nine years ago, China's education work has made great achievements under the leadership of the Party. These achievements are: recovering educational sovereignty from the imperialists; properly taking over schools across the country; abolishing the fascist management system of the Kuomintang reactionaries over schools and their fascist education and secret service rule over students; establishing a socialist education system; basically eliminating counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements hidden in the education field; opening Marxist-Leninist courses in schools; carrying out ideological remolding among teachers and students; carrying out departmental adjustment and teaching reform; carrying out the struggle against bourgeois rightists; increasing the number of students in colleges, secondary schools, and primary schools several times; making great progress in the literacy campaign and spare-time cultural and technical education; universally implementing the practice of combining work and study in schools; establishing Party organizations in the ranks of education workers; and cultivating a large number of cadres for socialist construction. The vast majority of comrades in education have worked hard to implement the Party's instructions. The achievements are the main aspect. However, education work has committed errors of separating education from productive labor and reality for a certain period of time, and to a certain extent, neglecting politics and the leadership of the Party. Nine years of work have given us experience and made it possible for us to more clearly and systematically put forward the education policy of the Party and the state, in order to unite the whole Party and all education workers who can be united, overcome right-leaning and dogmatic thinking in education work, and strive to better develop socialist education.

(3) The Party's education policy is that education serves proletarian politics and education is combined with productive labor. To realize this policy, education work must be led by the Party. Without the leadership of the Party, socialist education is unthinkable. Education is one of the powerful tools for transforming the old society and building a new society. Education work must be under the leadership of the Party in order to better serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction, to serve the elimination of all exploiting classes and the remnants of all exploiting systems, and to serve the construction of a communist society that eliminates the differences between cities and villages and the differences between mental and manual labor. The new people with all-round development in communist society are those who have both political awareness and culture, and who can engage in both mental and manual labor, rather than the bourgeois intellectuals of the old society who are only expert but not red and who are divorced from productive labor. The slogan "cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture" put forward by the Party correctly explains the meaning of "all-round development." Under the leadership of the Party, it is necessary to unite the working class, peasants, and the broad masses of intellectuals across the country to carry out a resolute struggle against the bourgeois ideas of "education for education's sake," "separation of mental and manual labor," and "education can only be led by experts." The struggle between the Party's education policy and the bourgeois education policy is, in its nature, a struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road.

In all schools, Marxist-Leninist political and ideological education must be carried out to cultivate the working-class class viewpoint (to struggle against the bourgeoisie), mass viewpoint and collective viewpoint (to struggle against individualism), labor viewpoint, i.e., the viewpoint of combining mental and manual labor (to struggle against the viewpoint of belittling manual labor and manual laborers, and advocating the separation of mental and manual labor), and the dialectical materialism viewpoint (to struggle against idealism and metaphysical viewpoints) among teachers and students. It is necessary to change the dogmatic teaching methods in political education that are divorced from the reality of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction and divorced from the specific education objects. When evaluating students' academic performance, students' political consciousness should be placed in an important position, and the degree of students' political consciousness should be measured by their actual actions. Neglecting political and ideological work and refusing to set up political courses in schools, regardless of the excuse, are wrong.

In all schools, productive labor must be listed as a formal course. Each student must participate in labor for a certain period of time in accordance with regulations. Now the movement of combining work and study has been universally launched. Facts have proved that as long as the leadership is good, participation in productive labor is beneficial to students in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education. This is a correct path to cultivate new people with all-round development. The future direction is for schools to run factories and farms, and for factories and agricultural cooperatives to run schools. Schools can run factories and farms by themselves, or they can assist factories and agricultural cooperatives to run them. Students can work in factories and farms run by schools themselves, or they can go to factories and agricultural cooperatives outside the school to participate in labor. Schools running factories and farms should pay attention to combining with teaching as much as possible. Schools should also assist factories and agricultural cooperatives in running schools. Local Party committees and governments should incorporate the factories and farms run by schools into local production plans and commercial sales plans, provide them with raw materials and promote their products, send technical workers to teach production technology, and pay attention to guiding and organizing their production. Factories and agricultural cooperatives running schools can train the talents they need, and should also train talents for other industrial or agricultural sectors; they should pay attention to running technical schools, and should also pay attention to running ordinary schools to improve the cultural level of all personnel, because this is necessary for realizing the cultural revolution and for realizing the grand goal of communism. This kind of school should also be incorporated into the local education plan, and the local Party committees and governments should pay attention to leading this kind of school and helping them to gradually solve the difficulties in terms of teachers, especially the difficulties of teachers in basic courses. Emphasize labor in schools that lack labor, and emphasize basic courses in schools that lack basic courses, so that both types of schools develop towards what they lack, and gradually move towards a more perfect combination of theory and practice. In order to train a large number of qualified teachers, Party committees and people's committees at all levels above the county level must develop normal education.

All education administrative organs and all schools should be under the leadership of the Party Committee; the Party Committee should pay attention to developing the organizations of the Party and the Youth League among teachers and students in schools. The schools affiliated to various departments of the Central People's Government should be under the political leadership of the local Party Committee. In all colleges and universities, the system of responsibility of the school affairs committee under the leadership of the school Party committee should be implemented; the system of one leader is prone to being divorced from the leadership of the Party committee, so it is inappropriate. The school Party Committee should assign Party members to lead the work of grades and classes, assign Party members to do political and ideological work, school administrative work and production management work, and the Party Committee Secretary and members should strive to take on the teaching and research work of political courses. The school Party Committee should often pay attention to carrying out the work of ideological remolding among teachers and pay attention to cultivating new forces. When promoting teachers, we should first pay attention to political and ideological conditions, academic level and the ability to solve practical problems, and seniority should be placed in a secondary position. When evaluating students, we should first pay attention to the degree of political awareness and the ability to solve practical problems, and also pay attention to the performance in class. All secondary and primary schools should also be placed under the leadership of the Party Committee. In order to strengthen the leadership of the Party in education, Party committees at all levels should transfer a group of cadres to education organs and schools.

(4) In order to develop education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, it is necessary to mobilize all positive factors, have the enthusiasm of the central government, the enthusiasm of the local governments, and the enthusiasm of factories, mines, enterprises, agricultural cooperatives, schools, and the broad masses of the people. For this reason, it is necessary to adopt the principle of combining unity and diversity, combining popularization and improvement, and combining overall planning and local decentralization:

A. The purpose of education is to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. This is unified throughout the country. Violating this unity will undermine the fundamental principles of socialist education. However, under this unified goal, the forms of running schools should be diverse, that is, the state running schools and factories, mines, enterprises, and agricultural cooperatives running schools simultaneously, ordinary education and vocational (technical) education simultaneously, adult education and children's education simultaneously, full-time schools and part-work part-study and spare-time schools simultaneously, school education and self-study (including correspondence schools and radio schools) simultaneously, and free education and non-free education simultaneously. That is to say, there will be three main types of schools in the country: the first type is full-time schools, the second type is part-work part-study schools, and the third type is various forms of spare-time schools.

B. Among the three types of schools, some of them should undertake the task of improvement. These schools must have complete courses, pay attention to improving the quality of their teaching and scientific research work, and improve the level of various disciplines. These schools should strive to help build new schools without harming their original level, but lowering the level of these schools is detrimental to the entire education cause. In order to quickly popularize education, it is necessary to vigorously develop spare-time cultural and technical schools and part-work part-study schools, because these schools can solve all or most of their funding problems and require little or no government assistance, and because these schools can find teachers locally according to the principle of "those who are capable can be teachers." The current use of the form of vigorously developing spare-time cultural and technical schools and part-work part-study schools to popularize education is of extremely important significance for improving the technical level of industrial and agricultural production and improving the political awareness and cultural level of the broad masses of the people; this kind of school will gradually become a school that is increasingly complete in terms of curriculum, equipment, and teachers. Spare-time schools have a bright future in the future. With the improvement of industrial and agricultural production technology and the development of industrial and agricultural production, working hours will be shortened. At this time, there is no difference between spare-time schools and part-work part-study schools. With the development of production and the increase of public accumulation, tuition-charging schools will also become free schools. Our principle is to improve on the basis of popularization, and to popularize under the guidance of improvement. It is "walking on two legs," not "walking on one leg."

C. In order to give play to the enthusiasm of the various departments of the Central People's Government and the enthusiasm of the local governments in education work, all primary and secondary schools and most of the colleges and universities, secondary vocational schools, and technical schools have been decentralized to the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions for management; secondary vocational schools and technical schools that still belong to the central ministries should also be decentralized by the ministries to the factories, mines, enterprises, and farms directly under the leadership of the ministries.

Each major collaboration zone should establish a complete education system based on its actual conditions and needs. Each province, city, and autonomous region should also gradually establish this relatively complete education system. Then, each special zone and each county should do the same. Each province, city, and autonomous region has the responsibility to meet the enrollment tasks of the schools affiliated to the central ministries, and the areas with developed education have the responsibility to help the areas with backward education. Areas with backward education should try their best to achieve the goal of not enrolling students from other provinces, cities, and autonomous regions within three to five years. The Central Ministry of Education is responsible for the comprehensive planning and balance of the national education cause.

The current school system needs to be actively and appropriately reformed. The Party committees and governments of the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have the right to actively conduct typical experiments on the new school system and report to the Central Ministry of Education. After sufficient experience is obtained through typical experiments, a new school system that is universally applicable throughout the country should be stipulated.

The textbooks for colleges and universities should be revised carefully under the leadership of the Party Committee using the "three-way combination" method of the Party Committee, teachers, and students, after a thorough airing of views, a great debate, and a great contention. Primary and secondary school textbooks should be compiled by the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and should be combined with local specific conditions when compiling them. The Central Ministry of Education should hold special meetings on various textbooks to exchange experiences, recommend better textbooks, determine which part of the textbooks should be universally used throughout the country, and determine the minimum and maximum subjects for various types of schools.

The date for enrollment in colleges and universities across the country is the second half of July and the first half of August. Under this unified stipulation, each province, city, and autonomous region has the right to stipulate the academic qualifications of its region in accordance with local conditions and report to the Central Ministry of Education. Abolish the nationally unified academic qualifications.

Local Party committees should organize cooperation between schools and various aspects such as industry, agriculture, commerce, cultural undertakings, and scientific research undertakings.

The issue of division of labor and cooperation between the central government and local governments after the decentralization of powers shall be handled in accordance with the "Regulations on the Decentralization of Management Powers of Education Undertakings" of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on August 4, 1958.

Special issues in the education of ethnic minority areas shall be decided by the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions and reported to the Central Ministry of Education.

(5) Education is the cause of the people. The people need education for the sake of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Running education needs to rely on a specialized team. It is impossible without a strong specialized team. However, the specialized team of education work must be combined with the masses, and running education must rely on the masses even more. It is wrong to mystify education work, thinking that only experts can run education, that "laymen cannot lead experts," that "the Party Committee does not understand education," that "the masses do not understand education," and that "students cannot criticize teachers." This kind of superstition can only prevent education from becoming the cause of the people, prevent education work from serving China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and thus prevent the development and progress of education work. Running education should be under the leadership of the Party Committee, combining professional education workers with the masses, adopting the mass line method of coming from the masses and going to the masses, and implementing education by the whole Party and the whole people.

Within the school, the mass line working method under the leadership of the Party Committee should also be implemented in political work, management work, teaching work, and research work:

1.  Speaking out freely, airing views fully, and posting big-character posters should become a universal and frequently adopted method for all colleges and universities and secondary schools to improve the political awareness of teachers and students, improve teaching methods and education management work, improve teaching quality, and strengthen the unity of teachers and students.

2.  When formulating the school education plan and formulating the teaching syllabus, the method of combining teachers and students under the leadership of the Party Committee should be adopted.

3.  When evaluating students and assessing student grants, the method of combining teachers and students under the leadership of the Party Committee should also be adopted.

4.  Teaching courses must implement the principle of linking theory with practice. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the method of hiring experienced people (cadres, model workers, labor heroes, (local) experts) to teach courses together with professional teachers should be adopted as much as possible.

5.  School leaders should try their best to integrate with students in life and labor. Party and Youth League workers and political teachers should eat, live, and labor with students. The school's financial and construction plans should be made public to all teachers, students, and staff so that they can participate in management work.

6.  A democratic and equal relationship should be established between teachers and students. Teachers should approach students, frequently understand students' situations, and implement education in light of the actual situation. "All-round development" should be combined with "teaching students in accordance with their aptitude."

Scientific research should implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." In the senior grades of the social science departments of colleges and universities, some courses should be set up to introduce or criticize bourgeois theories to establish the opposite.

The principle of running schools diligently and thriftily must be adhered to. School funds should be used for teaching and production, and expenditures on improving teaching work and increasing projects unrelated to production should be reduced as much as possible.

(6) The country should basically complete the tasks of eliminating illiteracy, popularizing primary education, having a middle school in every agricultural cooperative, and enabling most preschool children to enter nurseries and kindergartens within three to five years. Secondary education and higher education should be vigorously developed, and efforts should be made to basically enable young people and adults across the country, who are qualified and willing, to receive higher education in about fifteen years. We will use about fifteen years to popularize higher education, and then another fifteen years or so to engage in improvement work. The CCP Central Committee and the State Council call on the whole Party, the people of the whole country, and all education workers to strive to complete this glorious task of the cultural revolution. The Party committees and people's committees of the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should formulate specific plans based on their actual conditions.

    关于教育工作的指示
    一九五八年九月十九日
    ·内容要点·
    培养出一支数以千万计的又红又专的工人阶级知识分子的队伍，是全党和全国人民的巨大的历史任务之一。——团结全党和一切可能团结的教育工作者，克服教育工作中的右倾思想和教条主义思想。——党的教育工作方针，是教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合，为实现这个方针，教育工作必须由党来领导。在一切学校中，必须进行马克思列宁主义的政治教育和思想教育，培养教师和学生的工人阶级的阶级观点，群众观点和集体观点，劳动观点即脑力劳动与体力劳动结合的观点，辩证唯物主义的观点。今后的方向，是学校办工厂和农场，工厂和农业社办学校。——必须采取统一性与多样性相结合，普及与提高相结合，全面规划与地方分权相结合的原则。各大协作区应根据自己的实际情况和需要，建立起一个完整的教育体系。——办教育应在党委领导之下，把专业的教育工作者同群众结合起来，采取从群众中来，到群众中去的群众路线的方法，贯彻全党全民办学。——我们将以十五年左右的时间来普及高等教育，然后再以十五年左右的时间来从事提高的工作。
    （一）经济战线上的社会主义革命已经取得了基本胜利，政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，社会主义建设在工农业生产方面已经出现了大跃进的形势。为了彻底完成社会主义革命，为了适应社会主义建设的需要，为了实现共产主义的远大目标，必须“在继续进行经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的同时，积极地进行技术革命和文化革命”。（中国共产党第八届代表大会第二次会议的决议）随着工农业生产的大跃进，文化革命已经开始进入高潮，这主要表现在全国扫盲运动、教育事业和各种文化事业的迅速发展。正确地领导教育工作，坚持党的教育工作的方针，反对右倾思想和教条主义，调动一切积极因素，鼓足干劲、力争上游，多快好省地扫除文盲，普及教育，培养出一支数以千万计的又红又专的工人阶级知识分子的队伍，是全党和全国人民的巨大的历史任务之一。
    （二）全国解放九年以来，我国教育工作在党的领导之下取得了巨大的成绩。这些成绩是：从帝国主义者手里收回了教育主权；妥善地接收了全国的学校；取消了国民党反动派对学校的法西斯管理制度和对学生的法西斯教育和特务统治；建立起社会主义的教育制度；基本上肃清了隐藏在教育界的反革命分子和其他坏分子；在学校中开设了马克思列宁主义的课程；在教师和学生中进行了思想改造；进行了院系调整和教学改革；进行了反对资产阶级右派的斗争；高等学校、中等学校和小学的在校学生都增加几倍；扫盲运动和业余的文化技术教育有了很大的发展；在学校中开始普遍地实行了勤工俭学；在教育工作者的队伍中建立了党的组织；为社会主义建设培养了大量的干部。在教育工作岗位上，绝大多数的同志是努力执行了党的指示的。成绩是主要的，但是，教育工作在一定的时期内曾经犯过教育脱离生产劳动、脱离实际、并且在一定程度上忽视政治、忽视党的领导的错误。九年的工作，使我们得到了经验，并且使我们有可能更加明确地和系统地提出党和国家的教育工作方针，以便团结全党和一切可能团结的教育工作者，克服教育工作中的右倾思想和教条主义思想，更好地为发展社会主义的教育事业而奋斗。
    （三）党的教育工作方针，是教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合；为了实现这个方针，教育工作必须由党来领导。没有党的领导，社会主义的教育是不能设想的。教育是改造旧社会和建设新社会的强有力的工具之一。教育工作必须在党的领导之下，才能很好地为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，为消灭一切剥削阶级和一切剥削制度的残余服务，为建设消灭城市与乡村的差别和消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别的共产主义社会服务。共产主义社会的全面发展的新人，就是既有政治觉悟又有文化的、既能从事脑力劳动又能从事体力劳动的人，而不是旧社会的只专不红，脱离生产劳动的资产阶级知识分子。党所提出的“培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的口号，正确地解释了“全面发展”的涵意。必须在党的领导之下，团结全国的工农劳动群众和广大的知识分子，同“为教育而教育”，“劳心与劳力分离”和“教育只能由专家领导”的资产阶级思想进行坚决的斗争。党的教育工作方针同资产阶级教育工作方针之间的斗争，按其性质来说，是社会主义道路和资本主义道路两条道路之间的斗争。
    在一切学校中，必须进行马克思列宁主义的政治教育和思想教育，培养教师和学生的工人阶级的阶级观点（同资产阶级进行斗争），群众观点和集体观点（同个人主义观点进行斗争），劳动观点即脑力劳动与体力劳动结合的观点（同轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者、主张劳心劳力分离的观点进行斗争），辩证唯物主义的观点（同唯心主义和形而上学的观点进行斗争）。必须改变政治教育中脱离我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的实际、脱离具体教育对象的教条主义的教学方法。评判学生学习成绩的时候，应当把学生的政治觉悟放在重要的地位，并且应当以学生的实际行动来衡量学生的政治觉悟的程度。轻视政治思想工作，和拒绝在学校中设政治课，不论用什么借口，都是错误的。
    在一切学校中，必须把生产劳动列为正式课程。每个学生必须依照规定参加一定时间的劳动。现在勤工俭学的运动已经普遍开展起来了，事实证明，只要领导得好，参加生产劳动对学生来说，不论在德育、智育或体育方面都有好处，这是培养全面发展的新人的一条正确道路。今后的方向，是学校办工厂和农场，工厂和农业合作社办学校。学校办工厂和农场，可以自己办，也可以协助工厂和农业合作社办。学生可以在学校自办的工厂和农场中劳动，也可以到校外的工厂和农业合作社去参加劳动。学校办工厂和农场，要尽可能注意同教学结合。学校也要协助工厂和农业合作社开办学校。地方党委和政府，应当把学校所办的工厂和农场，纳入地方的生产计划和商业销售计划，对它们供给原料和推销它们的产品，派技术工人去传授生产技术，并注意指导和组织他们的生产。工厂和农业合作社办学校，可以训练工厂和农业合作社自己所需要的人才，也应该为其他工业部门或农业部门训练人才；应该注意办技术学校，也应该注意办普通学校来提高所有人员的文化水平，因为这是实现文化革命所必需的，是实现共产主义的远大目标所必需的。这种学校也应该纳入地方的教育计划，地方党委和政府要注意领导这种学校，帮助他们逐步解决师资方面的困难，特别是解决基础课程的师资的困难。在缺乏劳动的学校里强调劳动，在缺乏基础课程的学校里强调基础课程，使两种学校都向自己所缺乏的方面发展，逐步向理论与实际的更完善的结合前进。为了训练大量称职的师资，县以上的各级党委和人民委员会都必须发展师范教育。
    一切教育行政机关和一切学校，应该受党委的领导；党委应该注意在学校师生中发展党和青年团的组织。中央人民政府各部门所属的学校，在政治上应该受当地党委的领导。在一切高等学校中，应当实行学校党委领导下的校务委员会负责制；一长制容易脱离党委领导，所以是不妥当的。学校党委，应当配备党员去领导级和班的工作、配备党员去做政治思想工作、学校的行政工作和生产管理工作，党委书记和委员力求担任政治课的教学、研究工作。学校党委应当在教师中经常注意进行思想改造的工作，注意培养新生力量。在提拔师资的时候，要首先注意政治思想条件、学识水平和解决实际问题的能力，资历应当放在次要的地位。在鉴定学生的时候，要首先注意政治觉悟的程度，解决实际问题的能力，同时也注意课内学习的成绩。一切中等学校和初等学校，也应该放在党委的领导之下。为了加强党在教育事业中的领导，各级党委要输送一批干部到教育机关和学校中去。
    （四）为了多快好省地发展教育事业，必须动员一切积极因素，既要有中央的积极性，又要有地方的积极性和厂矿、企业、农业合作社、学校和广大群众的积极性，为此必须采取统一性与多样性相结合，普及与提高相结合，全面规划与地方分权相结合的原则：
    甲、教育的目的，是培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，这是全国统一的，违反这个统一性，就破坏社会主义教育的根本原则。但是，在这个统一的目标下，办学的形式应该是多样性的，即国家办学与厂矿、企业、农业合作社办学并举，普通教育与职业（技术）教育并举，成人教育与儿童教育并举，全日制学校与半工半读、业余学校并举，学校教育与自学（包括函授学校、广播学校）并举，免费的教育与不免费的教育并举。这就是说，全国将有三类主要的学校：第一类是全日制的学校，第二类是半工半读的学校，第三类是各种形式的业余学习的学校。
    乙、三类学校中，有一部分要担负提高的任务。这部分学校必须有完备的课程，注意提高自己的教学工作和科学研究工作的质量，提高各门学科的水平。这些学校应该在不损害原有水平的情况下，努力帮助建设新校的工作，但降低这些学校的水平，对整个教育事业来说是不利的。为了很快地普及教育，应当大量发展业余的文化技术学校和半工半读的学校，因为这种学校可以全部或者大部解决自己的经费，很少需要或者不需要政府的帮助，因为这种学校可以按照“能者为师”的原则就地找到师资。现在用大量发展业余的文化技术学校和半工半读的学校的形式来普及教育，对于提高工业和农业生产的技术水平，和提高广大人民的政治觉悟和文化水平，有极其重要的意义；这种学校将要逐渐成为在课程、设备、师资等方面日益完备的学校。业余学校在将来有远大的前途，随着工业和农业生产技术的提高，随着工、农业生产的发展，劳动时间将会缩短，这时候，业余学校和半工半读的学校就没有区别了。随着生产的发展和公共积累的增多，收费的学校也将变为免费的学校。我们的原则，是在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及，是“两条腿走路”，不是“一条腿走路”。
    丙、为了在教育工作中既能发挥中央人民政府各部门的积极性，又能发挥地方的积极性，全部的小学中学和大部分的高等学校、中等专业学校、技工学校，已经下放给省、市、自治区管理；仍属中央各部的中等专业学校和技工学校，也应当由各部下放给各部所直接领导的厂矿、企业、农场管理。
    各大协作区应该根据自己的实际情况和需要，建立起一个完整的教育体系。各省、市、自治区也应该逐渐建立起这种比较完整的教育体系。然后，每个专区，每个县也应该这样做。各省、市、自治区有责任满足中央各部所属学校的招生任务，教育事业发达的地区有帮助教育事业落后的地区的责任，教育事业落后的地区要尽力在三年至五年内做到不向别的省、市、自治区招生。中央教育部负责全国教育事业的综合规划和平衡。
    现行的学制是需要积极地和妥当地加以改革的，各省、市、自治区的党委和政府有权对新的学制积极进行典型试验，并报告中央教育部。经过典型试验取得充分的经验之后，应当规定全国通行的新学制。
    高等学校的教材，应该在党委领导下采取党委、教师、学生“三结合”的方法，经过大鸣大放大争大辩，认真予以修订。中小学教科书，由各省、市、自治区组织力量编写，编写时应当结合当地具体情况。中央教育部应召开各种教材的专门会议，交流经验，推荐较好的教材，确定全国应该通用的那一部分教材，确定各类学校的最低限度和最高限度的科目。
    全国高等学校招生的日期，是七月下半月和八月上半月。在这个统一规定下，各省、市、自治区有权依照当地的情况规定本地区的学历，报告中央教育部。废除全国统一的学历。
    地方党委应当组织学校同工业、农业、商业、文化事业、科学研究事业等各方面的协作。
    关于职权下放后中央与地方的分工协作问题，依照中共中央和国务院1958年8月4日“关于教育事业管理权力下放问题的规定”办理。
    少数民族地区教育中的特殊问题，由省、市、自治区作出决定，报告中央教育部。
    （五）教育是人民群众的事业。人民群众是为了社会主义革命和社会主义建设而需要教育事业的。办教育需要依靠专门的队伍，没有强大的专门队伍是不行的。但是，教育工作的专门的队伍必须与群众结合，办教育更必须依靠群众。把教育工作神秘化，以为只有专家才能办教育，“外行不能领导内行”，“党委不懂教育”，“群众不懂教育”，“学生不能批评先生”，那就是错误的。这种迷信，只能妨碍教育成为人民群众的事业，妨碍教育工作为我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，因而也妨碍教育工作的发展和进步。办教育应当在党委领导之下，把专业的教育工作者同群众结合起来，采取从群众中来、到群众中去的群众路线的方法，贯彻全党全民办学。
    在学校内部，在政治工作、管理工作、教学工作、研究工作等方面，也应该贯彻党委领导下的群众路线的工作方法：
    1、大鸣大放，大字报，应当成为一切高等学校和中等学校提高师生政治觉悟、改进教学方法和教育管理工作、提高教学质量，加强师生团结的普遍和经常采用的方法。
    2、制定学校教育计划；制定教学大纲的时候，应当采取党委领导之下教师与学生结合的方法。
    3、对学生进行鉴定、评定学生助学金等的时候，也应当采取在党委领导下，师生结合的方法。
    4、教授课程必须贯彻执行理论与实际联系的原则，应当在党委领导之下，尽可能采取聘请有实际经验的人（干部、模范工作者、劳动英雄、（土）专家）同专业教师共同授课的方法。
    5、学校领导人员要尽可能在生活和劳动中同学生打成一片。党和团的工作者、政治课教师，应当同学生同吃、同住、同劳动。学校的财政、建设计划等，应该向全体师生员工公开，使师生员工能参加管理工作。
    6、应当在教师与学生之间建立民主的平等的关系。教师应该接近学生，经常了解学生的情况，针对实际情况施行教育，要把“全面发展”与“因材施教”结合起来。
    科学研究，应当实行“百家争鸣”的方针。在高等学校社会科学各系的高年级中，应当设立一些介绍或批判资产阶级学说的课程，树立对立面。
    必须坚持勤俭办学的原则。把学校的经费用于教学，用于生产，尽量减少用于对改善教学工作和增加与生产无关的项目的经费。
    （六）全国应在三年到五年的时间内，基本上完成扫除文盲、普及小学教育、农业合作社社社有中学和使学龄前儿童大多数都能入托儿所和幼儿园的任务。应当大力发展中等教育和高等教育，争取在十五年左右的时间内，基本上做到使全国青年和成年，凡是有条件的和自愿的，都可以受到高等教育。我们将以十五年左右的时间来普及高等教育，然后再以十五年左右的时间来从事提高的工作。中共中央和国务院，号召全党、全国人民和全体教育工作者，为完成这个文化革命的光荣任务而努力。各省、市、自治区党委和人民委员会，应当根据自己的实际情况，作出具体规划。
