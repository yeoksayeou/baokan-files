Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Starting October 1st this year, all urban and rural post and telecommunications self-operated agencies across the country will handle telegraphic transfer services, and the telegraph fee for each telegraphic transfer will be uniformly reduced to six jiao. This is a recent decision made by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.

In the past, telegraphic money transfer services were limited to some larger post and telecommunications bureaus nationwide, and general post and telecommunications bureaus could only transfer money through post and telecommunications bureaus that handled telegraphic transfers, thus preventing recipients from receiving the money quickly. In view of this situation, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications recently reformed the current telegraphic transfer system, simplified internal processing procedures, and made the above decision to meet the needs of the broad masses.

    全国邮电局所将办电汇
    新华社23日讯　从今年10月1日起，全国各城市和乡村的邮电自办机构，都将办理电汇业务，而且每笔电汇电报费一律减为六角。这是邮电部新近作出的决定。
    电报汇款业务，在全国过去只限于一些较大的邮电局之间施行，一般邮电局只能经过通电汇的邮电局转汇，因此使收款人不能迅速收到汇款。邮电部鉴于这种情况，最近改革了现行电汇制度，简化了内部处理手续，作出了以上适应广大群众需要的决定。
