    Xinhua News Agency, September 5th. "The Permanent Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, on behalf of the Asian and African people, expresses its heartfelt support for the heroic Chinese people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism." This is a sentence from the telegram sent by Yusuf al-Sibai, Secretary-General of the Permanent Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, to Zhu Ziqi, Secretary-General of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, on September 2nd.
    He also said in the telegram: "We condemn the United States for occupying China's territory of Taiwan and its unreasonable policy of refusing to recognize People's China as the sole representative of China. This is a typical example of American aggression against New China. Our movement will make unremitting efforts to restore the legitimate rights of People's China in the United Nations and to liberate Taiwan from the United States."

    新华社5日讯　“亚非人民团结理事会常设书记处谨代表亚非人民对英勇的中国人民反对美国帝国主义的正义斗争表示衷心支持”。这是亚非人民团结理事会常设书记处总书记优素福·西巴伊9月2日给中国亚非团结委员会秘书长朱子奇的电报中说的一句话。
    他在电报中还说：“我们谴责美国占领中国的领土台湾及其拒绝承认人民中国是中国的唯一代表的无理政策。这是美国侵略新中国的典型事例。我们的运动将为恢复人民中国在联合国的合法权利以及中国人民从美国手中解放台湾进行不懈的努力。”
