　　Double-Eared Rice and Triple-Eared Rice
    Qingjiang Agricultural Cooperative in Sinan County, Guizhou Province, recently discovered in a rice field planted with Qiannong 2363 that each clump had one or more rice stalks bearing double ears, and occasionally one bearing three ears.

    The double-eared rice is formed when a rice stalk develops a round stem and then branches out from a node about two inches above the ground to form double ears. The triple-eared rice is similarly formed when a rice stalk branches out into one ear at a node about two inches above the ground, and then branches out again into another ear at a node more than three inches high.

    These double-eared and triple-eared rice plants produce more grains than single-eared rice plants. Single-eared rice generally produces 200 to 250 grains per ear, while double-eared rice produces 350 to 400 grains, and triple-eared rice produces 450 to 500 grains. Based on general observations, the main ear of the double and triple-eared rice produces about the same number of grains as the single ear, while the other branched-out ear and two ears produce slightly fewer than the main ear.

    The Qingjiang Cooperative Management Committee has now decided to separately select these double-eared and triple-eared rice plants and harvest them separately as seeds for next year's propagation.

　　双穗稻和三穗稻
    贵州省思南县清江农业社，最近在一块种植黔农2363的稻田里，发现每窝都有一根或数根稻禾结双穗，间或还有一根结三穗的。
    双穗稻是在一根稻禾发兜圆秆后，离地二寸左右的节子上发岔结双穗的；三穗稻也同样是在一根稻禾里，离地二寸左右的节子里发岔一穗，三寸多高的节子里又发岔一穗。
    这些双穗稻和三穗稻，所结的籽粒都比单穗稻结的多。单穗稻一般每穗结籽二百至二百五十粒，双穗稻结籽达三百五十至四百粒，三穗稻结籽达四百五十至五百粒。从检查的一般情况看，双穗和三穗的主穗与单穗结的籽粒不相上下，其他发岔的一穗和二穗要略少于主穗。
    现在清江社管理委员会决定将这块双穗和三穗稻，分别选择出来，单打单收，作为来年繁殖的种籽。
