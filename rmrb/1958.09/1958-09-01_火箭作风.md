　　"Rocket Style"
　　Wu Rong, CPC Zhenjiang Prefectural Committee

    In the past, we often went back to implement things only after the meeting was over; now, we implement and act while the meeting is still going on. People call this "rocket style."

    One summer evening, Yan Jingzhan, Secretary of the CPC Liyang County Committee, rushed back to Liyang from Nanjing to convey the spirit of the Jiangsu Province Three-Level Cadre Conference to the township Party committee secretaries and made arrangements overnight. The next morning, he returned to the Nanjing meeting. Others advised him to rest for a while, but he smiled and said, "What's the big deal about not sleeping for a night? It was common to stay up for days and nights during the war!" Many other county Party secretaries did the same. The secretaries of the Zhenjiang Special District County Party Committee used a recess day to hold a mobile on-site meeting, running to three counties. As for writing letters and making phone calls during meeting breaks, that goes without saying! The guest house specially added more than 20 telephones, and the telecommunications bureau sent people to work day and night, but it was still often "busy." The secretaries said, "One day now is equal to twenty years. High speed is the soul of the General Line. If you are slow, others will catch up." No one wants to be in the middle, so naturally, no one wants to miss a second.

    Under the influence of the leaders' rocket-like style, many "rocket teams" who "camp in the fields" and "sleep on construction sites" have emerged among the masses. They are determined to send "satellites" into the sky and work hard day and night.

    With so many "rockets," there is no fear of "satellites" not going into the sky!

### “火箭作风”

　　“火箭作风”
　　中共镇江地委　吴鎔
    过去，往往是开完会才回去贯彻；现在，边开会就边贯彻边行动，人们把这叫做“火箭作风”。
    一个暑天的黄昏，中共溧阳县委书记颜景詹从南京赶回溧阳，向乡党委书记会议传达了江苏省三级干部会的精神，连夜作了部署。第二天清早，他又回到了南京会场。别人劝他休息一下，他笑笑说：“夜把夜不睡怕啥？打仗时几天几夜不合眼也是老常事啊！”旁的县委书记也有不少是这样做的。镇江专区各县委书记就利用一个休会的日子，开了一个旅行现场会议，跑了三个县。至于会议休息时间写信、打电话就不用说啦！招待所里专门添了二十多部电话机，电信局派人昼夜值班，忙起来还老是“满座”。书记同志们说：“现在一天等于二十年，高速度是总路线的灵魂，你慢一着，旁人就赶到前面去了。”谁也不愿甘居中游，因此很自然地，谁也不愿错失一秒钟。
    在领导者火箭式作风的影响下，群众中出现了不少“田头扎营”、“工地睡觉”的“火箭小组”，他们坚决要把“卫星”送上天，日夜刻苦经营。
    有了这么多“火箭”，不怕“卫星”不上天！
