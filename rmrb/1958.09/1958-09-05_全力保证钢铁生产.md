　　The recent enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held in Beidaihe pointed out that industrial production and construction must first ensure key areas.

　　So, what are the key points in the current industrial production and construction? The enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee pointed out: "The central issue in industry is the production of steel and the production of machinery, and the development of machinery production depends on the development of steel production." That is to say, there are two key points in industrial production and construction, namely steel and machinery, and steel is the most important of the key points. Producing 10.7 million tons of steel is a top priority task for the Chinese people at present. We must go all out to achieve this great task, and we must overfulfill the task, and we must never produce one ton less.

　　To ensure the key points, we must realistically solve the problems that exist in completing 10.7 million tons of steel. The main ones are the supply of ore, coke, and refractory materials, the manufacture of blowers and various smelting and steel rolling equipment, as well as the allocation of labor and technical workers needed for tens of thousands of small blast furnaces. Only when these problems are properly solved can we ensure that tens of thousands of newly built small blast furnaces produce iron quickly and in large quantities, ensure that the original large and medium-sized modern iron and steel enterprises fully utilize their equipment potential, and ensure that all steel ingots are turned into steel of various specifications, so as to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural development. How can we solve these problems quickly and well? This requires efforts in two aspects. First, the metallurgical industry departments and various localities should rely on their own efforts, fully mobilize the masses, actively exploit and utilize local resources, actively carry out technical innovation campaigns, improve tools and equipment, improve efficiency, and save labor. Second, organize collaboration and mutual support. In terms of resources, areas with more resources should actively support areas with fewer resources. In terms of mechanical equipment, areas with strong mechanical manufacturing capabilities should actively support areas with weak manufacturing capabilities, and other industrial enterprises should actively support metallurgical enterprises. In terms of labor, areas with more labor should actively support metallurgical enterprises. In terms of technology, cities should support rural areas, large factories should support small factories, old factories should support new factories, and advanced factories should support backward factories. Organizing collaboration and mutual support is the guarantee for the high-speed development of the socialist economy. The workers of the seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, through more than a month of round-the-clock intense labor during the Great Leap Forward, used scrap materials to make two sets of steel rolling mills each with an annual output of 30,000 tons of seamless steel tubes, and they were installed in August. But when the higher authorities asked them to take out these beloved equipment to support fraternal enterprises in the southwest, they unhesitatingly dug the machines out of the concrete foundation, and sent people to Yunnan and Sichuan to help install them and impart technology; they also had to ensure the completion of the original leap forward plan under the condition of reduced equipment. As long as every enterprise has this spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, not to mention 10.7 million tons of steel, even more can be achieved.

　　To organize collaboration and to guarantee 10.7 million tons of steel, we must have the overall view of stopping cars to give way, first for steel. The "stopping cars to give way" mentioned here, of course, does not mean that all other production should stop and everyone should engage in steel production, but that all departments and all localities should put steel production and construction in the first place. When the development of the steel industry conflicts with the development of other industries in terms of equipment, materials, power, and manpower, other industries should voluntarily give up or lower their requirements, giving way to the steel industry first. Therefore, no matter which locality or department has materials, equipment, or transportation, they must first give them to the steel industry; those with manufacturing capabilities must first produce for the steel industry; electricity must first be transmitted to the steel industry; coal and other fuels must first meet the needs of the steel industry; those with labor and technical strength must first be transferred to the steel industry. On August 29, the Shanghai Liberation Daily published a news article "Who Will Support," saying that in order to fully utilize scrap iron to make steel, Shanghai steel workers need a large number of high-silicon iron. Due to the increase in production and the failure of purchased high-silicon iron to arrive, the supply of high-silicon iron is currently very tight in various steel mills. They hope that fraternal enterprises will provide strong support. When the newspaper came out in the morning, by 4 pm on the same day, 11 units, including Leisheng Radio Factory, All-China Federation of Trade Unions Warehouse, Tilam Bridge District "Drought Relief" Office, and the Shanghai Office of the Jiangxi Provincial Handicraft Industry Cooperative, contacted the Shanghai Metallurgical Industry Bureau, and supported a total of 52 tons of high-silicon iron. The spirit of these enterprises and units giving way to the steel marshal is our example. Whatever the steel industry needs, we should support it. We should not only take out what we have, but also try every means to complete the support task even if we don't have it. We must know that the key and the general are a unity of opposites. The development of the key needs the support and guarantee of the general, and the development of the key in turn supports and guarantees the development of the general.

　　Our national system is democratic centralism. Our socialist economy is developing in a planned and proportional way. High-speed and large-scale economic development requires, on the one hand, giving full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the people, and on the other hand, strictly maintaining the planning and discipline of the construction cause throughout the country. In order to give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the people, planning work should be managed at different levels, and local organizations at all levels should retain appropriate discretionary power. However, in order to maintain the planning and discipline of the construction cause throughout the country, the plans at all levels must be an integral part of the unified national plan, and local organizations at all levels must be jointly responsible and jointly strive for the national plan under the centralized and unified leadership of the Central Government. Local organizations at all levels must go all out and resolutely complete the production tasks and collaboration tasks assigned by the state to ensure key areas on time and guarantee quality. This is by no means just a matter of the attitude of one region towards another region, or one department towards another department, but a matter of attitude towards national planning and discipline. Here, we must resolutely wage an irreconcilable struggle against departmentalism and decentralism.

　　The broad masses of people and cadres in our country are transforming their subjective world while transforming the objective world, and the noble style of mutual assistance and cooperation is growing day by day. After the call of the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee was announced, the spirit of the people and cadres became more vigorous and their enthusiasm became higher. As long as the Party organizations at all levels firmly grasp the production of steel, firmly grasp the collaboration to ensure key areas, and guide the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to the goal of completing the national plan, the steel output will definitely double.

### 全力保证钢铁生产

　　全力保证钢铁生产
    最近在北戴河举行的中共中央政治局扩大会议指出：工业的生产和建设必须首先保证重点。
    那么，什么是当前工业生产和建设中的重点呢？党中央政治局扩大会议指出：“工业的中心问题是钢铁的生产和机械的生产，而机械生产的发展又决定于钢铁生产的发展。”这就是说，工业生产和建设中的重点有两个，即钢铁和机械，而钢铁又是重点中的重点。生产一千零七十万吨钢，是我国人民当前的一项头等重要的任务，我们必须为实现这个伟大任务，全力以赴，只能超额完成任务，而决不能少一吨钢。
    要保证重点，就必须实实在在地解决为完成一千零七十万吨钢所存在的问题。其中主要的有矿石、焦炭、耐火材料的供应问题，鼓风机和各种冶炼、轧钢设备的制造问题，还有数以万计的小高炉所需要的劳动力和技术工人的调配等问题。只有这些问题适当解决了，才能保证几万座新建的小高炉快出铁，多出铁，保证原有的大中型现代钢铁企业充分发挥设备潜力，保证所有的钢锭都变成各种规格的钢材，从而满足工业和农业发展的需要。怎样才能又快又好地解决这些问题呢？这要从两方面努力。一是冶金工业部门和各个地方自力更生，充分发动群众，积极开采和利用本地资源，积极开展技术革新运动，改进工具和设备，提高效率，节省劳动力。二是组织协作，互相支援。在资源方面，资源多的地方应该主动支援资源少的地方。在机械设备方面，机械制造力量大的地方应该主动支援制造力量小的地方，其他各个工业企业应该主动支援冶金企业。在劳动力方面，劳动力多的地方应该主动支援冶金企业。在技术方面，城市应该支援农村，大厂支援小厂，老厂支援新厂，先进的支援后进的。组织协作，互相支援，是社会主义经济高速度发展的保证。鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂职工，在大跃进中经过一个多月日日夜夜的紧张劳动，用废旧材料制成了两套各年产量三万吨无缝钢管的轧钢机，并且已在8月份安装完毕。但当上级要他们拿出这两套心爱的设备支援西南兄弟企业的时候，他们毫不犹豫地把机器从混凝土基础里刨出来，并派人送到云南、四川去帮助安装和传授技术；自己还要在设备减少的情况下，保证完成原来的跃进计划。只要每一企业都具有这种舍己为人的互助协作精神，不用说一千零七十万吨钢，就是再多一些也能够达到。
    要组织协作，要保证一千零七十万吨钢，必须具有停车让路，首先为钢的全局观点。这里所说的“停车让路”，当然不是说，所有的其他生产都停下来，大家都去搞钢铁生产，而是说，各部门、各地方都要把钢铁的生产和建设放在首要的地位。当钢铁工业的发展与其他工业的发展，在设备、材料、动力、人力等方面发生矛盾的时候，其他工业应该主动放弃或降低自己的要求，让路给钢铁工业先行。所以，不管哪一个地方哪一个部门，有材料、有设备、有交通运输工具，必须首先让给钢铁工业；有制造能力的，必须首先为钢铁工业而生产；电力必须首先输送给钢铁工业；煤炭及其他燃料必须首先满足钢铁工业的需要；有劳动力和技术力量的，必须首先调给钢铁工业。8月29日，上海解放日报刊登了一篇“谁来支援”的新闻，说上海炼钢工人为了充分利用废杂铁炼钢，需要大批高矽铁。各炼钢厂由于产量增加和购买的高矽铁未到，目前高矽铁的供应很紧张，希望兄弟企业大力支援。报纸早晨出来，到当天下午四时止，就有雷声无线电厂、全总仓库、提篮区“抗旱”办公室和江西省手工业联社驻沪机关等十一个单位和上海冶金工业局联系，共支援高矽铁五十二吨。这些企业单位为钢铁元帅让路的精神是我们的榜样。钢铁工业需要什么，我们就应该支援什么，不仅拿出现有的，没有的也要想尽一切办法完成支援任务。要知道，重点和一般是对立的统一。重点的发展需要一般的支援和保证，重点发展起来了又反过来支援和保证一般的发展。
    我们的国家制度是民主集中制。我们的社会主义经济是有计划按比例地发展的。高速度的、大规模的经济发展，一方面要求充分发挥人民群众的积极性和主动性，另一方面要求严格保持全国范围的建设事业的计划性和纪律性。为了充分发挥人民群众的积极性和主动性，计划工作应该分级管理，各级地方组织应该保有适当的机动权。但是，为了保持全国范围的建设事业的计划性和纪律性，各级的计划都必须是统一的全国计划的组成部分，各级地方组织都必须在中央的集中统一的领导下，对国家计划共同负责，共同努力。各级地方组织对于国家分配的保证重点的生产任务和协作任务，必须全力以赴，坚决地按时完成并且保证质量。这绝不仅仅是这个地区对待别一个地区、这一个部门对待别一个部门的态度问题，而是对待国家计划和纪律的态度问题。在这里，我们必须坚决地向本位主义和分散主义作不调和的斗争。
    我国广大的人民群众和干部，正在改造客观世界的斗争中同时改造着自己的主观世界，互助协作的高尚风格正在日益成长。中央政治局扩大会议的号召公布以后，人民群众和干部的精神更加奋发，干劲更加高涨。只要各级党组织紧紧抓住钢铁的生产，紧紧抓住保证重点的协作，把群众的积极性和创造性引导到完成国家计划的目标上来，钢产量就一定能够翻一番。
