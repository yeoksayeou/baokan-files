Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 31st. Prominent figures from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou Municipality spoke to our reporter today regarding the statement issued by the British Hong Kong authorities on the 29th concerning the Chung Wah Middle School incident.

　　Ant Mei-hou, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, who had just returned from the Chaoshan Plain, said angrily: Disregarding the protests of the Chinese people and our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, the British Hong Kong authorities issued another statement on the evening of the 29th regarding the forced closure of the Chung Wah Middle School premises and the assault on teachers, students, and Chinese journalists. On the one hand, they are attempting to evade responsibility for the bloody crimes they orchestrated, and on the other hand, they are viciously slandering Chinese journalists and newspapers. This conspiracy must be exposed. He said that facts prove that the British Hong Kong authorities had been plotting to persecute Chung Wah Middle School for a long time, and the so-called "dangerous" school buildings are merely a "covering one's ears while stealing a bell" trick. He said that we, the overseas Chinese in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, fully support the two protest statements from our government. The British Hong Kong authorities must promptly provide a responsible response. The British Hong Kong authorities must punish the perpetrators who assaulted the teachers, students, and Chinese journalists of Chung Wah Middle School and apologize to those who were assaulted, and promptly resolve the issue of the school's reopening.

　　Fang Shao-yi, Deputy Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: The statement by the British Hong Kong authorities is completely an act of evasion and does not respond to the protest note from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the four demands made by Chung Wah Middle School. This shows that the British Hong Kong authorities continue to adopt an attitude hostile to the Chinese people. The actions of the Hong Kong authorities in forcibly closing Chung Wah Middle School are not merely a matter of dealing with one school, but a matter of hating the patriotic education of compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

　　Du Bo-kui, Principal of Pui Kiu Middle School in Hong Kong, who was unreasonably deported by the British Hong Kong authorities not long ago, angrily refuted the so-called statement by the Hong Kong Chief Secretary. He pointed out that the Hong Kong Chief Secretary's statement insults the truthful reports of our journalists and newspapers. All these attempts are in vain. In the face of a large amount of evidence and witness testimony, the British Hong Kong authorities must immediately admit their mistakes, compensate for the losses, punish the Hong Kong British police who committed the assault, and ensure that incidents of persecuting the patriotic education cause in Hong Kong will not happen again in the future.

　　Wang Qi, a professor in the Chinese Department of Zhongshan University, said that the statement by the British Hong Kong authorities said that they closed the school to protect the lives of young people and adults, fearing that the school buildings were unsafe. Are the British Hong Kong authorities really so kind and caring about the safety of young people and adults? Then why, when Heung To Middle School was surrounded by Chiang gang special agents two years ago in October, the teachers and students who stayed in the school made dozens of calls to the British Hong Kong authorities, but they never sent a single police officer to protect the lives of young people and adults?

### 任何谎言洗脱不掉血腥罪行  广东省和广州市知名人士驳斥香港当局的声明

　　任何谎言洗脱不掉血腥罪行
    广东省和广州市知名人士驳斥香港当局的声明
    据新华社广州31日电　广东省、广州市各界知名人士今天就香港英国当局在29日发表的关于中华中学事件的声明分别向本社记者发表谈话。
    刚刚从潮汕平原回来的广东省华侨事务委员会副主任蚁美厚愤怒地说：香港英国当局不顾中国人民和我国港九同胞的抗议，于29日晚上再就强行封闭中华中学校舍，殴辱中华中学师生和中国新闻记者的事件发表一项声明，一方面是企图为其一手制造的血腥罪行开脱责任，另一方面是对中国记者和报纸进行恶毒地污蔑。这个阴谋是要加以揭穿的。他说，事实证明，香港英国当局对中华中学的迫害蓄谋已久，所谓校舍“危险”只是“掩耳盗铃”的把戏。他说，我们广东省广州市的华侨完全拥护和支持我国政府的两个抗议声明，香港英国当局必需迅速做出负责的答复，香港英国当局必需惩办殴辱中华中学师生和中国新闻记者的肇事人，并向被殴辱的人道歉，从速解决中华中学的复学问题。
    中国国民党革命委员会广州市市委副主任委员方少逸说：香港英国当局的声明完全是狡赖，并没有答复我国外交部的抗议照会和中华中学提出的四项要求，这可以看出香港英国当局还是继续采取敌视中国人民的态度。香港当局强行封闭中华中学的行为，这不仅是对付一所学校问题，而是仇视港九同胞爱国教育的问题。
    不久以前，被香港英国当局无理递解出境的香港培侨中学校长杜伯奎愤怒地驳斥了香港布政司的所谓声明。他指出：香港布政司的声明侮蔑我国记者和报纸忠于事实的报道。这些都是枉费心机的，在大量的人证物证面前，香港英国当局必须立即承认错误，赔偿损失，惩办行凶的香港英国警察，并保证今后不再发生迫害香港爱国教育事业的事件。
    中山大学中文系教授王起说，香港英国当局的声明说他们封闭学校是为了保护年青人及成人的生命、怕校舍不安全。香港英国当局真是这样慈悲善良，关心青年及成人的安全吗？那为什么前年十月香岛中学受到蒋帮特务分子的包围时，留在学校里的教师同学打了几十次电话给香港英国当局，他们却一直没有派一个警察去保护年青人和成人的生命呢？
