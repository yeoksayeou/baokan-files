    Mutual Cooperation to Welcome the Peak Season
    Northwest Region Commercial Collaboration Meeting Arranges Purchasing and Sales Work Under the New Situation
    (Our report) The first Northwest Cooperation Region Commercial Work Collaboration Meeting was held in Xining City from August 25th to September 1st. The meeting focused on discussing and studying the guiding principles of commercial work under the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and the issues of mutual cooperation and support among the five provinces and regions in the Northwest.
    In addition to sufficiently estimating the achievements made in the commercial work of the five provinces and regions in the Northwest, the meeting concentrated on analyzing the new situation facing commercial work—the greater leap forward that will occur in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production, especially the series of changes brought about by the establishment of people's communes in agricultural and pastoral areas, and the new tasks brought to commercial work. The meeting believed that commercial work must adapt to this changed new situation, otherwise it would be in a passive state. According to the typical survey materials from several provinces and regions, after the establishment of people's communes in rural areas, they immediately required commercial departments to supply them with large quantities and varieties of means of production and means of livelihood. For example, Datong County in Qinghai Province will purchase more than 1,000 harvesters, potato diggers, and threshers each, more than 500 scales, more than 30 generators, and more than 50 tons of steel wire ropes in the second half of this year. Many places need large pots, steamers, and blowers due to the implementation of collective canteens; they need a large number of stationery, paper, and scientific instruments due to the rise of the cultural revolution; in order to save labor, they need a large number of sewing machines, etc. At the same time, they require commercial departments to purchase their agricultural products and industrial products in large quantities.
    Based on this new situation, the meeting pointed out that the following viewpoints must be clarified in the guiding principles of commercial work: First, under the leadership of the Party, it is necessary to rely on the masses to do a good job in purchasing and sales work, expand commodity circulation, and promote industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production. This is the main task of commercial work. The so-called support for industry is mainly to supply raw materials and purchase industrial products. If the local Party committee believes that commercial departments should run some industries to supplement the shortage of goods, they can appropriately run some. Some of the industries that have already been established should continue to be run well. Second, commercial departments must consciously accumulate funds for the state, and not only focus on promoting industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production without accumulating funds. A purely financial point of view is incorrect, and not accumulating funds is also incorrect. There should be accumulation targets in the future. Third, we should further strengthen the production of vegetables and live pigs, establish vegetable and live pig bases, and have sufficient vegetable planting area. During the meeting, representatives from various provinces and regions, in the spirit of communist cooperation, after full consultation, carried out mutual support in materials among the five provinces and regions. For example, Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu, and Shaanxi mutually supported 102 kinds of materials.
    On the issue of mutual cooperation, the meeting clearly pointed out that mutual cooperation is necessary, but the purpose of cooperation can only be conducive to the realization of national plans and centralized unity. Therefore, under the principle of self-reliance, affluent areas should support difficult areas more, and difficult areas should also do their best to take care of affluent areas.
    The meeting made a preliminary discussion on the issue of rural commercial networks after the establishment of people's communes; after exchanging opinions with each other on the issue of price connection between adjacent provinces and regions, proper arrangements were made. At the same time, the meeting also widely exchanged experiences in commercial work in various provinces and regions.

    互助协作迎接旺季
    西北区商业协作会议安排新形势下的购销工作
    本报讯　西北协作区第一次商业工作协作会议于8月25日到9月1日在西宁市举行。会议着重讨论和研究了工农业生产大跃进新形势下商业工作的方针问题，西北五个省区之间的相互协作、相互支援问题。
    会议除对西北五个省、区的商业工作所取得的成绩作了足够的估计以外，集中地分析了商业工作所面临的新形势——工农牧业生产将出现更大的跃进，特别是农业区和牧业区办起人民公社以后所引起的一系列的变化，给商业工作带来的新任务。会议认为商业工作必须适应这一变化了的新形势，否则就要处于被动状态。根据几个省区的典型调查材料，农村办起人民公社以后，立即要求商业部门供应它们数量大而品种多的生产资料和生活资料。如青海省大通县，今年下半年即要购买收割机、挖洋芋机、脱谷机各一千多台，磅秤五百多台，发电机三十多台，钢丝绳五十多吨。不少地方由于实行了集体食堂，需要大锅、大笼、吹风机；由于文化革命的兴起，它们需要大量的文具、纸张、科学仪器；为了节省劳动力，它们需要大量的缝纫机等等。同时，它们要求商业部门能大量收购它们的农产品和工业产品。
    根据这一新的情况，会议指出：在商业工作的方针上必须明确几个观点：第一、必须在党的领导下，依靠群众，做好购销工作，扩大商品流转，促进工、农、牧业生产。这是商业工作的主要任务。所谓对工业的支持，主要是供应原材料和收购工业产品。如果当地党委认为商业部门应当办些工业以补货源之不足，可以适当办一些。对原来已办起的一些工业，应继续办好。第二、商业部门一定要自觉地为国家积累资金，不要只顾促进工农牧业生产，而不积累资金。单纯的财政观点不对，不积累资金也不对。今后应当有积累的指标。第三、应当进一步加强对蔬菜、生猪的生产，建立蔬菜、生猪基地，要有足够的蔬菜播种面积。会议期间各省区的代表本着共产主义的协作精神，经过充分协商，五个省区之间在物资上进行了相互支援。如青海、宁夏、甘肃、陕西等地相互支援了一百零二种物资。
    在相互协作的问题上，会议明确指出：相互协作是必要的，但协作的目的只能有利于国家计划的实现和集中统一。因此，必须在自力更生的原则下，富足的地区应当更多地支持困难的地区，困难的地区也应当尽其可能照顾富足的地区。
    会议对办起人民公社以后农村商业网的问题做了初步讨论；对毗邻省区的物价衔接问题经过相互交换意见，做了妥善安排。同时，会议还广泛地交流了各省区商业工作的经验。
