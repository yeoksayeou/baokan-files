Warping facts, calling a deer a horse, sophistry, and confusing right and wrong are often manifestations of a state of mental derangement among reactionaries during the burgeoning of their ambitions. In the past, the "masterful performances" in this regard were by Hitler and Goebbels; now, it's the turn of Dulles, the darling of the American Rockefeller Consortium and the U.S. Secretary of State.

Precisely at the time when the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks were resumed, the United States continued to deploy troops in the Taiwan area, intensifying and expanding its military provocations against China. It was also at this time that Dulles, with his glib tongue, fully demonstrated his black-and-white-reversing bandit logic at the United Nations General Assembly. The current extremely serious situation in the Taiwan Strait is caused by the United States intensifying its military provocations there, not by China sending troops to San Francisco. However, Dulles, with his eyes closed, stubbornly insisted that the military actions taken by the Chinese people to liberate their own coastal islands were to "conquer by force" and "invade" the territory of "other countries." The key to easing the tense situation in the Taiwan area clearly lies in the United States stopping setting fires, yet Dulles stubbornly insists that the Chinese people must "cease fire." China's punitive actions against the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique for using islands like Kinmen and Matsu to carry out sabotage and harassment are entirely China's internal affairs, and there is no need for the United States to interfere. Dulles himself said, "I am not oblivious to the argument that today's Communist Chinese offensive is an act of civil war." Since the United States is not a party to the Chinese civil war, where does the question of a "cease fire" between China and the United States come from? Anyway, Dulles is just so shamelessly engaging in sophistry. For example, Dulles had to admit, "I am not oblivious to the fact that the coastal islands are geographically close to the Chinese mainland," but at the same time, he smeared the Chinese people's sacred right to recover their own territory as "seizing territory." Whose territory is it? Is it U.S. territory?

No matter how Dulles twists his tongue, he nakedly exposes that he is setting up a smokescreen for war preparations. The Chinese people have never been deceived or intimidated. Dulles has truly wasted his effort. Foreign Minister Chen Yi's solemn statement on the 20th is a manifestation of the iron will of the 600 million Chinese people to fight to defend the security of their motherland and world peace. The Chinese people love peace. But if the aggressors dare to impose war on our heads, the Chinese people have never feared war. Dulles does not open his eyes to see the fundamental changes in liberated China, to see the incomparably heroic determination and confidence of the Chinese people in their struggle for their just cause. He still wants to use the old set of 19th-century imperialism, which should have been sent to the historical museum long ago, to attempt to suppress the Chinese people. That will only put a noose around his own neck, and the Chinese and the world people will pull it tighter and tighter. Dulles once lamented in his book "War or Peace": "Today, in a sense, we are all members of a suicide club." Really, members of the Washington and Wall Street suicide club, if you really don't touch the ass of your paper tiger and turn back quickly, Forrestal (Note) is indeed beckoning to you.

(Note) Forrestal was the former U.S. Secretary of Defense, known for his anti-Soviet and anti-communist stance, and later jumped to his death.

    枉费心机
    艾纳
    颠倒黑白，指鹿为马，强词夺理，混淆是非，往往是历来反动派在野心勃发中精神狂乱状态的一种表现。过去，这方面的“拿手好戏”要数希特勒、戈倍尔，现在，要轮到美国洛克菲勒财团的宠儿、美国国务卿杜勒斯了。
    正当中美大使级会谈恢复的时候，美国继续在台湾地区调兵遣将，加紧和扩大对中国的军事挑衅。也就是在这个时候，杜勒斯在联合国大会上鼓其如簧之舌，淋漓尽致地发挥其颠倒黑白的强盗逻辑。目前台湾海峡空前严重的形势，是美国在那里加紧进行军事挑衅造成的，并不是中国派兵到旧金山造成的。但是杜勒斯闭着眼睛硬说中国人民为解放自己沿海岛屿所采取的军事行动是要“武力征服”和“侵略”“它国”领土。要缓和台湾地区的紧张局势关键明明在于美国停止放火，杜勒斯却硬说要中国人民“停火”。中国对于蒋介石卖国集团利用金门、马祖等岛屿进行破坏和骚扰行为而采取的惩罚性行动，完全是中国的内政，何劳美国来干涉？杜勒斯自己也说，“我并不漠视认为今天中国共产党的进攻是一个内战行动的论点”。既然美国并非中国内战的一方，那末，中美之间哪来什么“停火”的问题呢？反正杜勒斯就是这样不顾羞耻地强词夺理，例如杜勒斯一面不得不承认“我也不漠视沿海岛屿在地理上靠近中国大陆这一事实”，一面却又诬蔑中国人民收复自己领土的神圣权利为“夺取领土”。是谁的领土呢？是你美国的领土吗？
    杜勒斯尽管怎样翻弄舌头，却赤裸裸地暴露自己是在为战争准备放烟幕。中国人民是从来骗不了也吓不倒的。杜勒斯真是枉费了心机。陈毅外长二十日的严正的声明正是中国六万万人民决心为捍卫祖国安全和世界和平而战的钢铁般意志的表现。中国人民热爱和平。但如果侵略者胆敢把战争强加在我们的头上，中国人民是从来也不畏惧战争的。杜勒斯不睁开眼睛看看解放了的中国的根本变化，看看中国人民为了自己正义事业而奋斗的无比豪迈的决心和信心，还想用早该送进历史博物馆去的十九世纪帝国主义的老一套，来妄图把中国人民压下去，那只是使自己套上了绞索，让中国和世界人民愈拉愈紧。杜勒斯曾经在他所写的“战争或和平”一书中悲叹地说：“今天，在某种意义上说，我们大家都是自杀俱乐部的会员。”真的，华盛顿和华尔街自杀俱乐部的会员们，你们果真还不摸摸自己纸老虎的屁股，赶紧回头，那福莱斯特（注）确是在向你们招手了。
    （注）福莱斯特是前美国国防部长，反苏反共出名，后跳楼自杀。
