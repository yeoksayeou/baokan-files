Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 23rd: Soviet newspapers today published commentaries denouncing the U.S. government's rude action of returning Khrushchev's letter to Eisenhower.

The "Izvestia" published an editorial saying that this provocative action by the U.S. ruling clique has aroused the anger and contempt of the working people of the great Soviet Union and all socialist countries, and of all peace-loving people. This action by the White House has further sharpened the international situation. But Washington's attitude also proves another point, that is, whether the U.S. ruling clique is willing or not, their returning the letter of the head of the Soviet government proves that they cannot put forward any arguments to resist the harsh and just words put forward in the letter. This shameless act by the U.S. leaders once again proves that the truth is dazzling to them. The editorial said that the embarrassing situation of the U.S. foreign policy leaders is also reflected in the American press. The American press, after all, cannot hide the fact that Washington's arrogant actions and statements have aroused strong condemnation from the American people. The American public is increasingly uneasy about the possible consequences of military adventures against the People's China and refusing to listen to the warnings of the Soviet government.

The editorial offices of American newspapers are simply piled up with letters from readers who are worried that Washington's adventurous policy in the Taiwan area will drag the United States into the disaster of war.

The editorial emphasized that history will severely punish those national leaders who do not consider the healthy demands and interests of the people of the world, and who are bent on engaging in military adventures. It would be an unforgivable mistake if these leaders think they can escape responsibility by indecent tricks.

"Soviet Russia" said in a commentary that this is a self-exposure of the aggressor and a shameful act.

The newspaper wrote that, according to reactions from all over the world, the White House's move is a new blow to the U.S. diplomatic credibility and U.S. prestige.

"Red Star" wrote that this fact rudely violates the recognized diplomatic rules and proves that the U.S. ruling clique is using any means to create tension.

"Red Star" emphasized that the threats adopted by the U.S. government can neither scare the Chinese people nor the Soviet people. The only way to solve the Far East issue is to stop the U.S.-Chiang provocations and withdraw U.S. troops from Chinese territory.

    苏联报纸斥艾森豪威尔无理拒绝赫鲁晓夫信件
    美国害怕真理难逃历史惩罚
    新华社莫斯科23日电　苏联报纸今天发表评论，斥责美国政府退回赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信的无礼行动。
    “消息报”发表社论说，美国统治集团的这个挑衅行动引起了伟大的苏联和所有社会主义阵营国家的劳动人民和整个热爱和平的人类的愤怒和鄙视。白宫的这个行动使国际局势更加尖锐起来。但是华盛顿的态度还证明了另外一点，这就是不管美国统治集团愿意还是不愿意，他们退回苏联政府首脑的信就证明他们提不出任何论据来同信中所提出的严厉而公正的话相抗衡。美国领导人士这种无耻的举动再次证明，对他们来说，真理是刺眼的。社论说，美国外交政策领导人的狼狈处境也反映在美国的报刊上。美国报刊毕竟不能掩饰这样一个情况，这就是，华盛顿的狂妄行动和声明激起了美国人民的强烈谴责。美国公众对于向人民中国进行军事冒险和拒绝听取苏联政府的警告可能造成的后果，感到越来越不安。
    美国报纸的编辑部简直堆满了读者来信，他们担心华盛顿在台湾地区的冒险政策会把美国拖入战争的灾难。
    社论强调说，历史将严厉地惩罚那些不考虑健康的主张和全世界人民的利益而一心想从事军事冒险的国家领导人。如果这些领导人认为他们可以用不体面的伎俩摆脱责任，那就是不可宥恕的错误。
    “苏维埃俄罗斯报”在评论中说，这是侵略者的自我揭露，是一种可耻的行为。
    这家报纸写道，根据来自世界各地的反应，白宫的这一举动是对美国外交信誉和美国威信的新打击。
    “红星报”写道，这一事实粗暴地破坏了公认的外交规则，证明美国统治集团在不择手段制造紧张局势。
    “红星报”强调说，美国政府所采用的威胁既吓不倒中国人民，也吓不倒苏联人民。唯一解决远东问题的方法是制止美蒋挑衅，从中国领土撤走美国军队。
