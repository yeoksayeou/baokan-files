    What Did the American President Say?
    Xia Ren
    The words of the dignified President of the United States are so absurd that even a three-year-old would scoff at them. He even has the nerve to go to television and radio stations to show off and swagger. It is said that this is specifically to use the President's "personal prestige" to "influence" the domestic public and "allied nations." He truly knows nothing of shame.
    Here are just two small examples. First, Eisenhower said that the United States has the right to invade China's Taiwan, as well as Kinmen and Matsu. The reason is that he "believes" this is "extremely important for the security of the United States and the free world." Second, Eisenhower said that the Chinese people should not liberate their own territory of Kinmen and Matsu because "they (referring to the Chinese people) have been getting along without Kinmen ever since they seized (referring to the liberation of) mainland China nine years ago." This is what the dignified President of the United States solemnly told the people of the world. If this can be called reason, then saying the sun is black and the earth is soft can also be called reason.
    Regarding Eisenhower's words, I think it is enough to ask this rhetorical question: If someone said, "I believe that the United States is very important to the security of my country, so I must send troops to 'protect' the United States"; or "I think Mr. Eisenhower can get along without Washington (this is true; we often learn from Western news that Mr. Eisenhower often leaves Washington for vacation!), so please Mr. Ike, hand over Washington," what would happen? It would be strange if Eisenhower didn't jump up from his sofa and kick over the coffee table.
    However, such absurd words were spoken by the president of a major Western power. Hush!
    It's not worth getting seriously angry about Ike's absurdity. As long as he lives, he will probably continue to say such absurd things. Anyway, American monopoly groups control a particularly large number of televisions, radios, news agencies, and newspapers; and American journalists are particularly fond of inviting their president to use his personal prestige to influence others. Can we afford to be angry all the time?
    So the best way is to treat it as a joke. It can relieve fatigue after work, aid digestion after meals, enhance conversation when meeting friends, and serve as entertainment during leisure time. It's quite interesting. Anyway, let him say what he wants; it's our business to liberate Kinmen, Matsu, Taiwan, and Penghu.

### 美国总统说的什么话？

    美国总统说的什么话？
    侠人
    堂堂美国的总统，说出话来竟荒唐到连三岁小孩都要嗤之以鼻。他居然还有脸皮跑到电视广播台上去出头露面，大肆招摇。据说这还是特意以总统的“个人威望”来“影响”国内人心和“盟国”的。真是不知人间有羞耻事。
    这里只举两个小例子。第一，艾森豪威尔说，美国有权侵略中国的台湾以及金门和马祖。理由是他“相信”这是“对于美国和自由世界的安全是极其重要的”。第二，艾森豪威尔说中国人不应去解放自己的领土金门和马祖，理由是“他们（指中国人民）自从九年前攫取（指解放）了中国大陆以来，一直没有金门也过下来了”。这就是堂堂美国总统向全世界人民郑重其事地讲的话，这如果能叫作道理，说太阳是黑的，地球是软的，都可以叫作道理。
    对于艾森豪威尔的这些话，我看，只要这样反问一句就行了。假如有人说：“我认为美国对于我的国家的安全非常重要，因此必须派兵去‘保护’美国”；或者说“我认为艾森豪威尔先生，没有华盛顿也能过下去（这是真的，我们不是常从西方电讯中得知，艾森豪威尔先生常常要离开华盛顿去休假吗？），因此请艾克先生把华盛顿交出来。”结果怎么样呢？艾森豪威尔要不从他的沙发上跳起来踢翻茶几才是怪事。
    可是，类似这样荒唐的话却是一位西方大国的总统说出来的。嘘！
    值不得为了艾克的荒唐而认真生气。他只要活着，大概这种荒唐话是要常常讲的。反正美国垄断集团手里所掌握的电视、电台、通讯社、报纸又特别的多；美国的记者先生们，又特别爱请他们的总统出来用个人威望影响别人。我们要生气能生得过来吗？
    所以最好的办法，是把它当作笑料来谈论。工作后可解除疲劳，饭后可帮助消化，会友时可助谈兴，闲暇时可作消遣。倒也有趣得很。反正他说尽管他说，我们要解放金门、马祖、台湾、澎湖，这是我们的事。
