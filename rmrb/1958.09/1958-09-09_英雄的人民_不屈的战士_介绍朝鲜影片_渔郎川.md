　　Heroic People, Indomitable Warriors
　　—Introducing the Korean Film "Yolang River"
　　Lǐ Shàobái

"Yolang River" is a film depicting the Korean people's war against American aggression. It showcases a glorious chapter of this war—the Yolang River Campaign. It depicts how, in this campaign, the Korean People's Army, with the support of the people, severely struck the American pirates and achieved a brilliant victory in this campaign. The film reveals this truth: the American imperialists are nothing but paper tigers, destined to fail. The best way to deal with imperialist aggression is to strike them hard. Imperialists will only behave themselves in the face of the people's mighty power. Peace cannot be begged for but only won through struggle.

The significance of the film also lies in its truthful depiction of the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Korean People's Army and the Korean people, and the heroic qualities of the Korean people and army; and this relationship and these qualities are the fundamental reasons for their victory in the war against imperialist aggression. The images of the soldiers Wu Minghe, Jin Tiezhu, and the civilians Yin, Zhang Wanwu, are beautiful and moving images. The masses braved enemy fire, risking their lives, to transport ammunition and food for the People's Army; People's Army soldiers fought selflessly for the interests of the people. When you see Yin, that heroic mother, carrying her pot of rice cakes made for the People's Army soldiers, looking at the People's Army soldiers who came to pick them up, ignoring the enemy planes bombing and strafing overhead, eagerly rushing across the river, hit by a bullet midway and sacrificing her life, while her pot of rice cakes still floats past, how can you not be moved, not shed tears! The Korean people contributed everything they had to win the war against American imperialist aggression! When you see the soldiers Wu Minghe and Jin Tiezhu, after running out of bullets, walking out of the trenches with hand grenades, charging towards the invading enemy, how can you not be moved, not shed tears! The Korean people are such heroic people, the People's Army soldiers are such indomitable warriors, and the relationship between the people and the people's army is such a flesh-and-blood relationship. The Korean people are not to be trifled with. This is the clear theme expressed by the film.

The film's advantage also lies in its theme with ideological significance being expressed through a relatively perfect artistic form. I think that the film's shot processing and montage structure processing are very good. For example, in the film's opening three shots, the author uses a basically identical shooting direction to show three forces from three aspects. The first shot shows five soldiers, including Wu Minghe, walking towards the camera; the second shot shows the American spy Wen Renjie walking towards the camera in a disheveled manner; the third shot shows the people, including Zhang Wanwu, walking towards the camera. For the soldiers and the masses, the author arranges them on the mountain and uses upshots and eye-level shots; for the spy, he arranges him in the river and uses a downshot. The author then connects these three shots with the same speed and method, vividly expressing the three forces that constitute the film's conflict, and these three forces simultaneously converge on a focal point, thus unveiling the prelude to the film's conflict and achieving a very high artistic level. For example, when the film depicts the final battle, through repeated cross-cutting and contrasting montage processing, it shows: on the one hand, People's Army soldiers bravely fighting the enemy in blocking the enemy's attack, and on the other hand, the people tenaciously fighting enemy planes while transporting ammunition, not only having a good artistic effect, but more importantly, through this description, the flesh-and-blood relationship between the people's army and the people is most vividly and movingly expressed. The film's modeling processing is also very good. For example, the scenes of Wu Minghe and Jin Tiezhu's heroic sacrifice have a very strong moving power. When Wu Minghe was about to throw the last grenade, an enemy shell exploded next to him, a plume of smoke rose behind him, his body tilted down, then immediately stood up, stretched out his arms with difficulty, and threw the last grenade with force, and then an enemy shell exploded, and thick smoke obscured him. When Jin Tiezhu walked out of the trench, with a firm and calm expression on his face, holding a hand grenade and rushing towards the enemy, a shell exploded beside him, and he disappeared into the smoke. The author used the smoke of the shell explosion as the background for the characters' sacrifice, placing the characters in the smoke, and shooting it from the most appropriate angle and distance, making the characters appear so tall and so heroically fearless, most vividly revealing the heroic qualities of the Korean People's Army, vivid, moving, with the beauty and charm of oil paintings and sculptures. For example, in the last scene, when the support troops arrived, the author used close-ups and extreme close-ups to show Cui Qisong, Shunfeng, and Yunu successively rushing towards the enemy, and People's Army soldiers advancing with the national flag raised high. Then there is a shot of the people watching the People's Army advance. In this shot, the author allows the people to stand on the mountain, adopting a large-angle upshot, thus showing the tall image of the Korean people, indicating that the Korean people are forever the strong backing of the People's Army. The film's use of details is also excellent, such as Yin Min's rice cakes and Jin Tiezhu's cap badge, which all played a role in highlighting the characterization of the characters. In short, I think that the film's directing and photography processing have high artistic achievements. According to the ideological requirements of his work, the author endows the film with a magnificent form. The film shows the new achievements made by Korean film art.

The meeting of "Yolang River" with us today has a special practical significance. The vicious American imperialism seems to have forgotten the head-on blow it suffered on the Korean battlefield and is again engaging in war provocations in Taiwan, China. American paper tiger, remember the lessons of "Yolang River"! If the warmongers dare to impose war on the Chinese people, then the fate of countless Yolang River battles awaits them! In the Yolang River film, the company commander assigns combat tasks to the chief of staff.

　　英雄的人民  不屈的战士
　　—介绍朝鲜影片“渔郎川”
　　李少白
    “渔郎川”是一部描写朝鲜人民抗美战争的影片，它展示了这次战争的光辉一页——渔郎川战役。它描写了在这次战役中，朝鲜人民军怎样在人民群众的支援下，狠狠地打击了美国海盗，取得了这次战役的辉煌胜利。影片揭示了这样一个真理：美帝国主义者不过是一只纸老虎，是注定要失败的，对付帝国主义的侵略，最好的办法，是狠狠地打击它。帝国主义者只有在人民的强大威力面前，才会表现得老实一点，和平不能乞求而只有用斗争来争取。
    影片的意义还在于，它真实地表现了朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民之间的血肉关系，表现了朝鲜人民和军队的英雄素质；而这种关系和这种素质，正是他们取得反对帝国主义侵略的战争胜利的根本原因。影片所刻划的战士吴明河、金铁洙，群众尹氏、张万五的形象，是美好的形象、动人的形象。群众冒着敌人的炮火，出生入死，为人民军运弹送粮；人民军战士，为人民的利益在忘我战斗。当你看到尹氏、那位英雄的母亲，顶着她那盆为人民军战士做的米糕，望着来接他们的人民军战士，顾不得头顶上敌机的轰炸、扫射，迫不及待地抢过河去，中途中弹牺牲，而她那盆米糕，依然飘飘流过去的时候，你怎能不激动、不流泪！朝鲜人民就是这样为着取得反击美帝国主义侵略的战争的胜利，而贡献出自己的一切！当你看到战士吴明河、金铁洙在子弹打完之后，拿着手榴弹走出战壕，向着来犯的敌人冲去的时候，你怎能不激动、不流泪！朝鲜人民就是这样英雄的人民，人民军战士就是这样不屈的战士，人民和人民军队的关系就是这样血肉的关系。朝鲜人民是不可轻侮的。这就是影片所表现出来的鲜明主题。
    影片的优点还在于它的具有思想意义的主题是通过比较完美的艺术形式表现出来的。我觉得，这部影片的镜头处理和蒙太奇结构处理是非常好的。如影片开头的三个镜头，作者用一个基本相同的拍摄方向，表现了来自三个方面的三种力量。第一个镜头，表现出迎镜头走来的吴明河等五位战士，第二个镜头，表现出迎镜头狼狈走来的美国特务文仁杰；第三个镜头，表现出迎镜头走来的张万五等人民群众。对于战士和群众，作者把他们安排在山上，使用了仰摄和平摄；对于特务，则把他安排在河里，使用了俯摄。作者又把这三个镜头用相同的速度和方法连接一起，鲜明地表现出构成影片矛盾冲突的三种力量，而这三种力量又同时向一个焦点集中起来，从而揭开了影片矛盾冲突的序幕，达到了很高的艺术境界。再如影片在描写最后一场战斗时，通过反复交叉、对比的蒙太奇处理，表现出：一方面是人民军战士在阻击敌人进攻中与敌人英勇战斗，一方面是人民群众在运输弹药途中与敌机顽强搏斗，不仅有很好的艺术效果，更主要地，是它通过这种描写，把人民军队和人民之间的血肉关系，最生动最感人地表现了出来。影片的造型处理也是非常好的。如吴明河、金铁洙英勇牺牲的那些场面，就有着十分强烈的感人力量。当吴明河刚要扔出最后一颗手榴弹时，敌人打过来的炮弹在他身边爆炸了，背后扬起一股浓烟，他的身子随着歪下去，立刻又站起来，艰难地张开手臂，用力把最后这颗手榴弹投掷出去，又是敌弹的爆炸，浓烟遮没了他。当金铁洙走出战壕，脸上流露出坚毅而镇定的表情，拿着手榴弹向敌人冲去时，炮弹在他身边爆炸，他消失在烟雾中。作者利用炮弹爆炸的烟雾作为人物牺牲时的后景，把人物置于烟雾之中，而又通过最恰当的角度、距离把它拍摄出来，使人物形象显得是那么高大，那么英勇无畏，最鲜明地揭示出朝鲜人民军的英雄特质，生动、感人，有着油画和雕塑一般的美和魅力。再如最后一个场面，当支援部队到达后，作者通过近景和特写，表现出崔七松、顺凤、玉女接连向敌人冲出，人民军战士高举着国旗前进。接着是人民群众望着人民军前进的镜头。这个镜头，作者让人民群众屹立山上，采取了大角度的仰摄，从而表现出朝鲜人民的高大形象，表明了朝鲜人民永远是人民军的坚强后盾。影片对于细节的运用，也很出色，如尹民的米糕，金铁洙的帽徽，都起到了突出刻划人物的作用。总之我觉得这部影片的导演处理和摄影处理，是有很高艺术成就的，作者根据自己作品的思想要求，赋予影片以一个雄伟的形式。影片显示了朝鲜电影艺术所取得的新的成就。
    “渔郎川”在今天和我们见面，更有着特殊的现实意义，穷凶极恶的美帝国主义，似乎忘记了它在朝鲜战场上所受到的迎头痛击，又在我国的台湾地区进行战争挑衅，美国纸老虎，还是回忆一下在“渔郎川”的教训吧！如果战争贩子胆敢把战争强加在中国人民的头上，那么，无数个渔郎川战役的命运在等待着他们！渔郎川影片中连队长向参谋长布置战斗任务。      中国电影发行放映公司供稿
