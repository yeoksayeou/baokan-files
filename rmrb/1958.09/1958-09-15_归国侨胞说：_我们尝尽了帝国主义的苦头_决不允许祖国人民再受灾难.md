Returned Overseas Chinese say:
    We have tasted the bitterness of imperialism, and will never allow the people of our motherland to suffer disaster again.
    Following Dulles' provocative statement, American warships have continued to intrude into our territorial waters, seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. We warn American imperialism: if you continue to interfere in our internal affairs by force and impose war on us, we will certainly beat you until you are bloody and battered.
    We are returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand. In the past, we suffered the bitterness of imperialism and its running dogs. We will never relax our vigilance against the military provocations of American imperialism. We have joined the Red Flag teams of our school, learning military technology, and are always ready to respond to the call of the motherland and rush to the forefront!

    We are returned overseas Chinese from Vietnam. Due to the blatant interference of American imperialism, our parents and relatives are still in the divided South Vietnam, suffering under the bloody rule of American imperialism and its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem. We have long harbored a blood feud against American imperialism. Today, when we hear Dulles's arrogant clamoring, we feel even more angry. In addition to overfulfilling our work quotas, we are always ready to respond immediately as soon as the Party gives the order. At the same time, we will write letters to encourage our relatives overseas to enthusiastically respond to the call of the Party and the government, actively support the socialist construction of the motherland, and jointly build our country even stronger, so that the imperialists who dare to invade will know that the Chinese people love peace, but are never afraid of war!

    归国侨胞说：
    我们尝尽了帝国主义的苦头
    决不允许祖国人民再受灾难
    继美国杜勒斯发表挑衅的声明以后，美国军舰又不断侵入我国领海，严重威胁远东和世界和平。我们警告美帝国主义：如果你们继续武装干涉我国内政，把战争强加在我们的头上，我们一定把你们打得头破血流。
    我们是印度尼西亚、日本、越南、泰国的归侨。过去，吃尽了帝国主义及其走狗的苦头。我们绝不放松对美帝国主义军事挑衅的警惕。我们参加了我校的红旗队伍，学习军事技术，时刻准备着响应祖国的号召，奔向最前线！天津师范大学华侨联谊会教师小组

    我们是从越南归国的华侨。由于美帝国主义明目张胆的干涉，我们的父母和亲人，仍处在被分割的越南南方，受着美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳的血腥统治。我们对美帝国主义早就怀着血海深仇。今天，当我们听到杜勒斯狂妄叫嚣的声音后，感到更加愤怒。我们除了超额完成本岗位工作之外，并时刻准备着，只要党下一声命令，我们就立即响应。同时，我们将写信鼓励我们在海外的亲人，热烈响应党和政府的号召，积极支持祖国的社会主义建设，共同把我们的国家建设得更加强大，好让胆敢来侵犯的帝国主义知道，中国人民热爱和平，但决不惧怕战争！
