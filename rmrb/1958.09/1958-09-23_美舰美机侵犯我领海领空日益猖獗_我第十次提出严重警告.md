    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: On September 22nd, six American warships successively intruded into our territorial waters in the Fujian area, and ten batches of ten American naval fighter planes intruded into the airspace over our territorial waters in the Fujian area. One batch of one plane even intruded into the airspace over our mainland. A spokesman for our Ministry of Foreign Affairs was instructed to state: The recent actions of the U.S. Air Force and Navy in violating our territorial waters and airspace and wantonly provoking our country have developed to an increasingly rampant point. This behavior of playing with fire on the brink of war has made the situation in the Taiwan Strait area very serious. For this reason, the Chinese government issues its tenth serious warning.
