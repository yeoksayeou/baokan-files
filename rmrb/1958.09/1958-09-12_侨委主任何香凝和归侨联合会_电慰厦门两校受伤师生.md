This is another serious crime committed by the Chiang bandit army, following the shelling of peaceful residents and relatives of overseas Chinese in Jiangtou Town, Xiamen, and the teachers and students of Xiamen No. 3 Middle School, a crime that harms the country and the people and undermines education. All overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students are extremely angry at the heinous crimes committed by the Chiang bandit army and are determined to take practical actions to support the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front in severely punishing the traitorous Chiang bandit army."
