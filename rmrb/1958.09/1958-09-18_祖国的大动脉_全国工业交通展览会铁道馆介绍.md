    The Motherland's Main Artery
    —An Introduction to the Railway Pavilion at the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition
    By Our Correspondent Wang Liang

    A Tomorrow as Beautiful as a Fairytale
    The railway stretches out like a ribbon. Although the train hurtles forward at a high speed of 200 kilometers per hour, you feel no vibration and hear no noise. If we didn't look out the window, we wouldn't even realize the train was moving. At stations along the line, we see no switchmen, signalmen, or other operating personnel. Strange! Where have the people gone? It turns out the railway is using the latest remote automatic control equipment. The switches, signals, and train command work at stations within a range of hundreds of kilometers are all directly controlled by a single dispatcher.
    A huge plan of China's railway prospects and electric models and charts of some of the new technologies that will be used on the railway, exhibited in the Railway Pavilion of the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition, lead us to a tomorrow that is truly as beautiful as a fairytale. In the near future, China will build a modern, extensive railway network. Trains carrying passengers and goods will cross the Qaidam and Junggar Basins, gallop across the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and the Kang-Tibet Plateau, and speed through the towering mountains, deserts, and grasslands that are desolate today but will be paradises tomorrow. At that time, electric locomotives, internal combustion locomotives, gas turbine locomotives, and other newer types of locomotives will replace the current backward steam locomotives. Passenger trains will be very comfortable, with sofa seats, televisions, wireless telephones, and automatic temperature control devices.
    Dear readers, do you think this is a distant matter? Is it romantic fantasy? Then, please come to the Railway Pavilion of the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition and see for yourself. Here, you will immediately feel that China's beautiful railway prospects can be realized in the near future.

    The Bountiful Fruits of the Technological Revolution
    At the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition, we see that millions of railway workers across the country, inspired by the General Line for Socialist Construction, are moving forward with full force like locomotives! In just a few short months this year, the flowers of technological revolution and cultural revolution have bloomed all over the country's railways and have borne abundant fruits. The exhibits in the exhibition hall, including the physical objects, models, and charts of many inventions and creations by railway workers, are a powerful guarantee for turning China's beautiful railway future into reality.
    We watched an electric model of a simplified automatic block system with great interest. Automatic signal lights are installed on both sides of the railway line, dividing the railway between two stations into several sections. A train is slowly leaving the station. The signal light flashes green, which means that the railway section ahead is not occupied by a train, and the driver can boldly drive the train forward. We see that as the train continues to run forward, the signal lights along the line automatically emit red, yellow, and green lights in sequence, indicating the movement of trains behind to avoid the danger of collisions! The commentator said that a single-track railway between two stations could originally only run one train, and a double-track railway could only run a pair of trains facing each other, but now, more trains can be run, and the line's carrying capacity is greatly increased. This was created by the workers of the Fengtai Electrical Section of the Beijing Railway Administration. Its effect is the same as that of a standard automatic block system, but the investment is reduced by 80%, and there is no need to set up an AC high-voltage power transmission line, only a DC power supply is needed, which is very suitable for China's current conditions.
    There are countless such remarkable creations in the exhibition hall.
    Let me give another example of a new type of turnout. Everyone has the feeling when taking the train in and out of the station that the train body shakes and there is a clanging sound, which is due to passing over the turnout. The turnout has a "dead space," and trains must not only reduce their speed when passing through it, but also the rails and vehicles are greatly worn. This is a very headache-inducing problem on the railway. Now, we have created a new type of turnout that allows trains to pass through the station without reducing speed. The structure of this turnout is also very simple, and there is no need for a special turnout factory to manufacture it. The railway's engineering section can do it. It is said that this type of turnout has also appeared in the world, but because its stability problem has not been solved, it has not been applied, but we have solved this problem.
    The creator of this new type of turnout is not some learned engineer or mechanical expert, but a track maintenance worker from the Fengtai Engineering Section who only went to primary school. His name is Wang Yushu, and he is only twenty-three years old this year. We did not have the opportunity to talk to this respectable worker. But just hearing fragments of stories about him is enough to be moving. Originally, Wang Yushu also had a "sense of inferiority." He once superstitiously believed in foreign science and technology, thinking that "airplanes, ships, and trains are all made by foreigners, and China doesn't have many new things. What can a track maintenance worker like me come up with?" But the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction illuminated his heart. This worker, who deals with turnouts every day but doesn't understand any turnout theory, was determined to solve the turnout problem that has not been completely solved in the world. He kept thinking until two o'clock in the morning. While eating, he fiddled with his chopsticks while thinking of ideas. Suddenly, he discovered that the rotation of two chopsticks, from parallel to intersecting, was just like a turnout. The seeds of the new turnout began to sprout in this way...

    Build a Modern Railway Network
    To extend the railway to the Qaidam and Junggar Basins, to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and the Kang-Tibet Plateau, and to build a modern railway network in China in the shortest possible time, we will undoubtedly encounter many difficulties and many complex technical problems. But since we can build bridges over the Yangtze River, which is known as a "natural barrier," build railways on the Shu Road, which is "more difficult than ascending to the sky," and build the Yingxia Railway by moving mountains and filling the sea, is there anything else that can stop our railway construction from advancing?
    Standing in front of the model of the magnificent Yangtze River Bridge, I thought a lot. This largest river in Asia, which people used to think was unconquerable, has now succumbed to the will and wisdom of the people. A director of the General Bureau of Capital Construction of the Ministry of Railways told me that the world's latest bridge foundation construction method created in the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge—the pipe pile drilling method—has been further developed in the recent construction of the Yellow River Railway Bridge and other railway bridges. The diameter of the pipe piles has been expanded from 1.6 meters to more than 3 meters. This means that for a large bridge like the Yangtze River Bridge, which originally required dozens of pipe piles for one foundation, now only two are needed. The speed of bridge construction has been greatly increased.
    After hearing his words, and looking at the chart on the wall that says "Go all out and build 20 new bridges over the three major rivers in the next few years," would you have any doubts? Please see, in addition to the existing Wuhan Bridge, five more bridges will be built on the mighty Yangtze River: the Chongqing Jialing River, Baishadu, Yidu, Wuhu, and Nanjing bridges.
    At present, railway transportation is very tight. With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the volume of freight has increased dramatically. The task of building new railways is also very heavy. But in the face of heroic railway workers, there are no insurmountable difficulties. The countless facts in the Railway Pavilion powerfully answer this question.

    祖国的大动脉
    ——全国工业交通展览会铁道馆介绍
    本报记者　王良
    童话般美好的明天
    铁路像一条带似的伸展着。虽然列车以每小时二百公里的高速度向前疾驰，但是你一点也不感到震动，也没有声音。如果不向窗外看，我们甚至不觉得火车在行驶。在沿线的车站上，我们看不见一个扳道员、信号员和其他运转工作人员。奇怪！人到哪里去了呢？原来铁路上采用了一种最新的远距离自动控制设备，几百公里范围内的车站上的道岔、信号和列车的指挥工作，全由一个调度员直接操纵。
    全国工业交通展览会铁道馆展出的一幅巨大的我国铁路远景规划图和铁路上将要采用的一部分新技术的电动模型、图板，把我们引向一个真正像童话似的美好的明天。在不久的将来，我国将要建成一个现代化的四通八达的铁路网。载运旅客和货物的列车，将要越过柴达木盆地和准噶尔盆地，奔驰在云贵高原和康藏高原，奔驶在今天渺无人烟而明天是世外桃源的崇山峻岭、沙漠和草原。那时候，电气机车、内燃机车、燃气轮机车和其他更新型的机车，将要代替目前落后的蒸汽机车。旅客列车将是十分舒适的，有沙发座位、电视和无线电话，还有自动调节气温的装置。
    亲爱的读者，你认为这是很遥远的事吗？是浪漫主义的幻想吗？那么，请你到全国工业交通展览会铁道馆看一看吧。在这里，你将会立刻感到我国铁路这个美好的远景，是不久的将来就可以做到的事情。
    技术革命的丰硕果实
    在全国工业交通展览会上，我们看到全国成百万铁路职工在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，像火车头一样鼓足马力前进！在今年短短几个月的时间里，技术革命和文化革命的花朵就在全国铁路遍地开花，并结出了丰硕的果实。展览会上展出铁路职工的许多发明和创造的实物、模型和图板，就是把我国铁路美好的明天变成现实的有力保证。
    我们怀着极大的兴趣观看一个简易自动闭塞的电动模型。在铁路线的两侧安装着许多自动的信号灯，把两站之间的铁路分为若干个区段。一列火车正徐徐地从车站上开出去。信号灯闪耀着绿色的灯光，这是说，前面这个区段的铁路没有火车占用，司机可以大胆的把火车开过去。我们看见，这列火车继续向前跑的时候，沿线的信号灯会自动地依次发出红光、黄光和绿光，指示后面的列车行车，以免发生撞车的危险！讲解员说，两个车站之间的单线铁路本来只能开行一个列车，双线铁路只能开行一对相向的列车，现在，就可以开行更多的列车了，线路的通过能力大大增加。这是北京铁路管理局丰台电务段的职工创造的，它的效果同标准的自动闭塞相同，但投资却减少80％，而且不需要设交流高压送电线路，用直流电源就行了，非常适合我国目前的条件。
    像这样了不起的创造，在展览馆中可以数出无数个。
    让我再举一个新型道岔的例子。大家坐火车进出车站时有个感觉，车身摇晃，还有一种铿锵的响声，这是过道岔的缘故。道岔有个“有害空间”，列车通过时不仅必须降低速度，而且钢轨和车辆都受到很大的损耗。这是铁路上一个很头痛的问题。现在，我们创造出一种新道岔，火车通过车站可以不降低速度了。这种道岔的结构也很简单，不需要专门的道岔工厂去制造，铁路上的工务段就可以做。据说，世界上也曾出现过这种道岔，但因为没有解决它的稳定性问题，所以没有得到应用，而这个问题我们把它解决了。
    创造这个新型道岔的不是个什么有学问的工程师或机械专家，而是一个只念过小学的丰台工务段的养路工，他名叫王玉书，今年仅二十三岁。我们没有机会找到这位可敬的劳动者谈一谈。但是仅仅听来的关于他的片段的故事，已经够使人感动。原来，王玉书也有过“自卑感”。他曾迷信过外国的科学技术，认为“飞机轮船火车都是洋人搞的，中国的新玩艺儿不多。我一个养路工能搞出什么名堂来？”但是党的社会主义建设总路线把他的心照亮了。这个天天同道岔打交道但并不懂什么道岔理论的工人，下决心要解决世界上还没有完全解决的道岔问题。晚上他一直想到深夜两点。在吃饭的时候，他还一边摆弄筷子，一边想主意。忽然，他发现两根筷子转动，由平行到相交，正像道岔一样。新型道岔的种子就这样开始萌芽了。……
    建成一个现代化的铁路网
    要把铁路伸向柴达木盆地和准噶尔盆地，伸向云贵高原和康藏高原，在尽可能短的时间内在我国建成一个现代化的铁路网，毫无疑问，我们将碰到许多困难，遇到许多复杂的技术问题。但是，我们既然能在称为“天堑”的长江上建筑起大桥，在“难于上青天”的蜀道上修了铁路，并且移山填海地修建了鹰厦路，难道还有什么能阻住我们铁路建筑前进吗？
    站在宏伟的长江大桥的模型面前，我心里想得很多。这条过去人们认为不可征服的亚洲第一大河，现在向人民的意志和智慧屈服了。铁道部基本建设总局一位局长告诉我，在长江大桥的建设中创造的世界最新桥梁基础施工法——管柱钻孔法，在最近建筑黄河铁桥和其他铁路桥梁中，又有了新的发展。管柱的直径从一点六公尺扩大到三公尺多。这就是说，像长江大桥这样的大桥，原来一个基础要打几十根管柱的，现在只要打两个就够了。建桥速度大大提高。
    听了他这番话，再看看墙上这幅写着“鼓足干劲，在今后几年内在三大河流上新建大桥二十座”的图板，你难道会有丝毫怀疑吗？请看，在万里滔滔的长江上，除了现有的武汉大桥外，还要建筑重庆嘉陵江、白沙渡、宜都、芜湖和南京五座大桥。
    目前铁路运输很紧张。随着工农业生产大跃进而来的，是货运量的急剧增加。新建铁路的任务也非常繁重。但是在英勇的铁路职工面前是没有不可克服的困难的。铁道馆的无数事实有力地回答了这个问题。
