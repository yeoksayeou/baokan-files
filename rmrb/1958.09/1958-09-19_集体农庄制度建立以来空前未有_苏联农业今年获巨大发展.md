    Soviet Agriculture Achieves Tremendous Development This Year
    (Xinhua News Agency) TASS reported that, according to various materials, Soviet agriculture will achieve tremendous growth this year. This is unprecedented in the thirty years since the establishment of the Soviet collective farm system.
    The good prospects for Soviet state grain purchases are becoming increasingly clear. The Ukrainian Republic has already completed its plan for selling grain to the state, delivering nearly 500 million poods (each pood equals 32.76 catties). The Russian Federation delivered 1 billion poods, and Kazakhstan delivered more than 250 million poods. However, in Siberia, the largest granary of the Russian Federation, the large-scale grain delivery work has just begun. The grain delivery work in the central and northwestern states of this republic has not yet ended. Kazakhstan will deliver another 750 million poods of grain. In this way, the possibility of purchasing more grain this year than in 1956, the highest year in history, is gradually becoming a reality. In 1956, the state purchased 3.304 billion poods of grain.
    The prospects for livestock products, harvested vegetables, sugar beets and other crops are also encouraging. Encouraging signs have also emerged in increasing the number of livestock and vigorously establishing feed storage depots.
    In the past four and a half years, the total number of cattle in the Soviet Union has increased by 15.8 million, pigs by 14.3 million, and sheep by 28 million. This increase alone exceeds the number of livestock in France. The amount of milk produced by collective farms and state farms has doubled in three years, a result that was originally planned to be achieved in six years.
    How do these amazing achievements compare with the United States? In the four years from 1950 to 1953, the average annual growth rate of total agricultural output in the Soviet Union was 1.6%, while in the United States it was 1.7%. But in the last four years, the growth rate of Soviet agriculture has reached 7.1%, while the rate in the United States has dropped to 1.1%.

### 集体农庄制度建立以来空前未有  苏联农业今年获巨大发展

    苏联农业今年获巨大发展
    据新华社讯　塔斯社记者报道，根据各种材料来看，今年苏联农业将获得巨大的高涨。这是苏联集体农庄制度建立三十年来所未曾有过的。
    苏联国家粮食采购良好前景现在越来越明显了。乌克兰共和国已经完成了向国家交售粮食的计划，交售了将近五亿多普特（每一普特合三十二点七六市斤）粮食。俄罗斯联邦交售了十亿普特，哈萨克交售了两亿五千多普特。但是，在俄罗斯联邦最大的谷仓——西伯利亚，大规模的交售粮食的工作才刚刚开始，这个共和国中部各州和西北各州交售粮食的工作都还未结束。哈萨克还将交售七亿五千万普特谷物。这样一来，今年收购的粮食比历史上最高的年份1956年所收购的还要多的可能性就要渐渐变为现实了。在1956年，国家曾经采购了三十三亿零四百万普特谷物。
    在牲畜产品、收割蔬菜、甜菜和其他作物方面的前景也是令人鼓舞的。在增加牲畜头数、突击建立饲料储藏库方面也出现了令人鼓舞的景象。
    最近四年半来，苏联牛的总头数增加了一千五百八十万头，猪增加了一千四百三十万头，羊增加了两千八百万只。单是这个增长额就超过了法国的牲畜头数。集体农庄和国营农场的挤奶量三年内增加了一倍，这个成绩本来计划是要在六年内达到的。
    这些惊人的成绩同美国比较起来将是怎样呢？从1950年到1953年这四年中间，苏联农业总产量平均每年增长速度是1.6％，而美国是1.7％。但在最近四年中，苏联农业的增长速度达7.1％，而美国的速度却降低到1.1％。
