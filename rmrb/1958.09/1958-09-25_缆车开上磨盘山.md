Cable Car Opens on Mopan Mountain

    A cable car opens on Mopan Mountain, one person is better than a hundred carrying poles, shoulder pole carrying becomes a thing of the past, one day equals twenty years.
    The members of the Jinxin Agricultural Cooperative in Heming Township, Xichong County, Sichuan Province, recently built two 52-meter-long wooden rail cable car tracks on the 70-degree steep slope of Mopan Mountain. They were so happy that they composed such a quick-rhythm poem. The completion of the cable car track is indeed a happy event for Heming Cooperative. From now on, the grain and sweet potatoes from the mountain and the fertilizer from the foot of the mountain will no longer need to be carried by people, but will be transported by cable car. According to tests, each time it can transport 8,000 jin of fertilizer up the mountain and 32,000 jin of sweet potatoes or other grains down the mountain, the efficiency is ten times higher than manual carrying, and the labor intensity is also greatly reduced.
    When building the cable car track, the hillside was first leveled and compacted, then sleepers were laid and wooden rails were nailed on. At the top of the two tracks, a turntable was installed, and two wooden boxes were used with bamboo ropes for round-trip transportation.

    缆车开上磨盘山
    缆车开上磨盘山，一人胜过百人担，肩挑背磨成过去，一天等于二十年。
    四川西充县晋新乡鹤鸣农业社的社员，最近在七十度陡坡的磨盘山腰，修起了两条五十二公尺长的木轨缆车道，高兴之余编了这样一首快板诗。缆车道的建成，的确是鹤鸣社的一件喜事。从今以后，山上的粮食、红苕和山下的肥料等，完全不用人挑，而用缆车运输。据试验：每次可以运八千斤肥料上山，运三万二千斤红苕或其它粮食下山，工效比人挑提高了十倍，劳动强度也大大减轻了。
    修建缆车道的时候，先把山坡削平夯实，铺上枕木，钉上木轨条。在两条轨道的顶端，装上一个转盘，用竹绳带上两个木箱，来回运输。
