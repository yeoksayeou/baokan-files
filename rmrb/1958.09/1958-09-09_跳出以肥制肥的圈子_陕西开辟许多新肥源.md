　　Breaking Free from the Cycle of Using Fertilizer to Make Fertilizer: Shaanxi Opens Up Many New Fertilizer Sources

    (Our report) Shaanxi Province's various small-scale fertilizer plants are rapidly improving on the basis of extensive popularization; some plants have begun to change their practice of using fertilizer to make fertilizer, actively opening up new fertilizer sources and manufacturing indigenous chemical fertilizers.

    Currently, the new problem that has emerged after the widespread popularization of rural fertilizer plants in various parts of Shaanxi is the shortage of raw materials. To date, the province has established a total of about 63,000 granular fertilizer plants and indigenous chemical fertilizer plants. Among them, more than 8,000 plants produced 1.8 million tons of granular fertilizer, more than 1,800 tons of bone fertilizer, and 2.29 million tons of various indigenous chemical fertilizers by the end of June, according to statistics. These fertilizers have played a significant role in supporting agricultural production.

    However, the vast majority of these fertilizer plants are using fertilizer to make fertilizer. Granular fertilizer is made by mixing chemical fertilizer superphosphate of lime, ammonium sulfate, and farmyard manure. Most of the more than 50 kinds of indigenous chemical fertilizers that have been made in various places, such as indigenous urea, indigenous fertilizer powder, and crude phosphate-potash compound fertilizer, are made from human urine, plant ash, fertile soil, and some chemical fertilizers such as superphosphate of lime. Due to the limited natural fertilizer sources such as human urine and plant ash, and the supply of chemical fertilizer raw materials such as superphosphate of lime and ammonium sulfate falling short of demand, some factories are affected production due to a lack of raw materials.

    Under these circumstances, some local fertilizer plants have begun to find ways to open up new fertilizer sources and further produce various indigenous chemical fertilizers on the basis of using fertilizer to make fertilizer. At present, fertilizer plants in areas with sulfur mines, such as Chengcheng, have extracted ammonium sulfate from the waste slag from sulfur refining. Fertilizer plants in Fuping and other places with large amounts of saline-alkali land have also extracted potassium nitrate from nitrate-rich soil. The counties in the Shangluo Special District are vigorously establishing bacterial fertilizer plants. Lueyang and other counties have begun to mine apatite in large quantities to produce calcium sulfate. Some places, in conjunction with indigenous coking methods, have successfully recovered ammonium sulfate from coal and peat using indigenous methods. Some fertilizer plants are studying the recovery of sulfur from the coal smoke from brick and tile kilns.

    The achievements and new attempts made by these fertilizer plants have found the right way to further develop the production of existing fertilizer plants. First of all, it can completely solve the problem of raw materials. Shaanxi Province is rich in fertilizer-making raw materials. In Chang'an, Danfeng, Shangnan, and other seven counties alone, there are nearly 8 million tons of potash feldspar known to be available for making potash fertilizer. There are also large amounts of apatite in various places. In Ningqiang County in southern Shaanxi alone, two discovered sites have 10 million tons. Secondly, using indigenous methods to manufacture chemical fertilizers from these raw materials requires simple equipment and is easy to operate. Only some mills, iron pots, bellows, jars, urns, and a few pipes are needed for production. And existing fertilizer plants generally have these equipments. Thirdly, various resources can be comprehensively utilized, such as recovering ammonium sulfate from coal and peat, and also recovering by-products such as coal tar pitch. Finally, as a result of this comprehensive utilization, existing rural fertilizer plants will gradually become comprehensive chemical plants mainly engaged in fertilizer production, and also producing other products (such as pesticides).

### 跳出以肥制肥的圈子  陕西开辟许多新肥源

　　跳出以肥制肥的圈子  陕西开辟许多新肥源
    本报讯　陕西省的各种小型肥料厂正在大量普及的基础上迅速提高；有的厂已开始改变以肥制肥的做法，积极开辟新肥源，制造土化肥。
    目前，陕西各地农村肥料厂大量普及后所出现的新问题就是原料不足。迄今全省共办起的颗粒肥料厂、土制化肥厂共约有六万三千多个。其中八千多个厂到6月底统计，就生产了一百八十万吨颗粒肥料，一千八百多吨骨肥和二百二十九万吨各种土化肥。这些肥料对支援农业生产起了重大作用。
    但是，这些肥料厂绝大部分都是以肥制肥。颗粒肥料是用化肥过磷酸钙、硫酸?和农家有机肥搅合而成。各地已制成的五十多种土化肥，如土制尿素、土制肥田粉、粗制磷钾综合肥料等等，绝大多数都是用人尿、草木灰、肥土，再加一些过磷酸钙等化肥作成的。由于人尿、草木灰等自然肥源有限，过磷酸钙、硫酸?等化肥原料又供不应求，有些工厂就因缺乏原料而影响生产。
    在这种情况下，有些地方的肥料厂开始设法在以肥制肥的基础上，开辟新的肥源，进一步自制各种土化肥。目前在有硫磺矿的地区如澄城等地的肥料厂，已经从炼过硫磺的下脚料渣中提炼出了硫酸?。有大量盐碱地的富平等地肥料厂，也从硝土中提炼出硝酸钾。商雒专区各县正在大办细菌肥料厂。略阳等县开始大量采掘磷灰石制硫酸钙。有的地方结合土法炼焦，已经用土法从煤和泥炭中成功地回收了?。有的肥料厂正在研究从烧砖瓦窑的煤烟中回收硫?。
    这些肥料厂已做到的成就和新尝试，为进一步发展现有肥料厂的生产，找到了正确的途径。首先，它可以完全解决原料问题。陕西省蕴藏着丰富的制肥原料，单是长安、丹凤、商南等七个县，已知可供制钾肥用的钾长石就有近八百万吨。各地还有大量的磷灰石，单是陕南宁强县已发现的两处就有一千万吨。其次，采用土办法，用这些原料制造化肥，设备简单，操作容易，只用一些磨子、铁锅、风箱、缸、瓮和几根管子就能生产。而这些设备现有的肥料厂一般都具备。再次，可以综合利用各种资源，如从煤和泥炭中回收了硫酸?，还可同时回收煤焦油沥青等副产品。最后，也因为这样综合利用的结果，现有农村肥料厂便会逐步成为以肥料生产为主，又生产其它产品（如农药）的综合性的化工厂。
