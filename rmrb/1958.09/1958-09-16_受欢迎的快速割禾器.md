After the Hengyang City Construction Machinery Plant in Hunan Province successfully created a fast rice harvester, the masses in various parts of the Hengyang Special District further improved it based on the original design. According to statistics, as of August 14, there were more than 40 types of improved designs in the district, and more than 110,000 units had been promoted. After use, evaluation, and appraisal, four types of fast rice harvesters were very successful and were welcomed by the broad masses.

The advantages of these fast rice harvesters are: First, high efficiency: If the operating skills are proficient, generally each person can harvest 3-5 mu of rice per day, which is 2-4 times higher than using the old-fashioned sickle. Second, it can reduce labor intensity: The degree of bending over when using the fast rice harvester is small, and the operation is labor-saving, which is much easier than using the old-fashioned sickle. Women and semi-able-bodied laborers can use it. Third, it can be used in various different situations: Several fast rice harvesters can be used to harvest rice in dry fields and rice in paddy fields, and can harvest standing rice and lodged rice separately. Fourth, the structure is simple and easy to manufacture: The entire structure of the fast rice harvester requires only a small amount of wood and iron materials, and any blacksmith or carpenter can manufacture it. Fifth, the cost is low: Each unit only costs about 2 yuan.

In order to make it easy for various places to imitate, the structure of these four types of fast rice harvesters is now introduced as follows:

One. Dry Field Fast Rice Harvester

This fast rice harvester was successfully improved by the Jilong Street Township Agricultural Tool Factory in Hengnan County. It is suitable for use in dry fields. Both standing rice and rice that is not severely lodged can be harvested with this fast rice harvester. Its structure is divided into four parts: wooden handle, wooden clip, wooden roller, and sickle (see picture). The bottom of the wooden handle is installed on the sickle (the sickle has six holes and is nailed to the bottom of the wooden handle), the wooden clip is made of two curved small wooden strips, and the rice enters the middle from the front of the wooden clip, squeezing the rice into a bundle. The wooden roller is used to roll forward in dry fields, which can stabilize the height of the sickle from the ground. The sickle is composed of two iron blades, and the blade part of the sickle is serrated (the same as the old-fashioned sickle) and mixed with steel. When installing the sickle, pay attention to two points: 1. The place where the bases of the two sickle pieces meet must be close together without gaps. 2. A small iron piece must be placed in the middle of the connection between the bottom of the wooden handle and the sickle to ensure that the sickle can be stably fixed on the wooden handle to avoid the two blades from opening due to the softness of the wood. Paying attention to these two points can avoid the phenomenon of rice straw clogging.

Two. Paddy Field Fast Rice Harvester

This fast rice harvester was also successfully improved by the Jilong Street Township Agricultural Tool Factory in Hengnan County. It is suitable for use in paddy fields. Both standing rice and rice that is not severely lodged can be harvested with this fast rice harvester. Its structure is basically the same as the first type, except that the wooden handle is not equipped with a wooden roller, but a boat-shaped bottom plate (see picture). Its function is to slide forward in paddy fields and stabilize the height of the sickle from the ground.

Three. Lodged Fast Rice Harvester

This fast rice harvester was also successfully improved by the Jilong Street Township Agricultural Tool Factory in Hengnan County. It is suitable for harvesting lodged rice. If it is used in dry fields, a wooden roller can be made according to the first type; if it is used in paddy fields, a boat-shaped bottom plate can be made according to the second type. The rest of the structure is basically the same as the first type. The difference is that an "arch-shaped rice support frame" is installed on the side of the wooden clip (either the left or right side) (see picture). When pushed forward during use, the lodged rice stands up along the "arch-shaped rice support frame" and enters the middle of the wooden clip, becoming a bundle.

Four. Spring Clip Rice Fast Rice Harvester

This fast rice harvester was successfully improved by Comrade Huang Zhengyang of the Hengyang Automobile Repair Factory. It is suitable for use in dry fields and paddy fields. Both standing rice and severely lodged rice can be harvested with this fast rice harvester. Its shape is somewhat different from the first type. The structure is divided into four parts: wooden handle, spring, sickle, and movable wooden clip (see picture). The bottom of the wooden handle is installed on the sickle, and the spring is installed on the wooden handle and the wooden clip. The spring tightens the movable wooden clip to squeeze the rice into a bundle, and when it is released, it can be unloaded on the ground. The sickle is a herringbone-shaped blade with serrations on it, a curved groove in the middle, and a round hole. Rice straw is leaked through the curved groove and the round hole to avoid rice straw clogging on the sickle.

Of the above four types of fast rice harvesters, the first three were the most widely promoted, and the fourth type was less promoted due to its more complex structure. Regarding the use of fast rice harvesters, attention should be paid to mastering the following points: First, for harvesting rice that has not lodged, choose the side with straight rows for harvesting. For rice lodging not exceeding 35 degrees, the harvesting method can be to harvest along the lodging direction, or to harvest horizontally according to the lodging direction. For those exceeding 35 degrees, horizontal harvesting should be carried out according to the lodging direction. For very severe lodging, a lodged fast rice harvester can be used for harvesting. Second, during use, the height of the sickle must be strictly controlled. The sickle should be harvested parallel to the ground. If it is too high, it will not be cut off. If it is too low, it will shovel into the mud. Third, during harvesting, if uncut rice stalks are found to be lying under the sickle, they must be cleaned up before continuing harvesting, otherwise, the phenomenon of continuous uncut stalks will occur, and the pushing resistance will be increased. Fourth, the speed of pushing the fast rice harvester forward should be faster, if it is too slow, it will not be easily cut off, and the efficiency will not be high. Fifth, when using, grasp the wooden handle with both hands and push forward, one row can be harvested at a time. After the rice enters the middle of the wooden clip, take out the rice bundle by hand, or stand the fast rice harvester up and step on it with your foot to drop it. Generally, more than ten stalks can be harvested at a time. (Originally published in New Hunan Daily)

    受欢迎的快速割禾器
    湖南衡阳市建设机械厂创造快速割禾器成功以后，衡阳专区各地群众又在原来的基础上进行了进一步的改进。据统计，截至8月14日为止，全区改进的式样即达四十多种，已经推广了十一万多件。经过使用、评比鉴定，其中四种快速割禾器是很成功的，受到了广大群众的欢迎。
    这些快速割禾器的优点是：第一、工效高：如果操作技术熟练，一般每人每天可以割禾三——五亩，比旧式镰刀割禾提高工效二——四倍。第二、可以减轻劳动强度：用快速割禾器弯腰的程度不大，操作省力，比用旧式镰刀割禾要轻松得多，妇女、半劳力都可使用。第三、能适合在各种不同的情况下使用：几种快速割禾器，可以分别割干田里的禾和水田里的禾，可以割立起的禾和倒伏了的禾。第四、结构简单制造容易：快速割禾器的全部构造，只需少量的木料和铁料，凡铁、木工都可以制造。第五、成本低廉：每部只需人民币二元左右。
    为了使各地便于仿制，现将这四种快速割禾器的构造介绍如下：
    一、干田快速割禾器
    这种快速割禾器是衡南县鸡笼街乡农具厂改进成功的。适合在干田里使用。凡立起的禾和倒伏不严重的禾都可以用这种快速割禾器。其构造分为木手柄、木夹子、木滚轮、镰刀等四部分（见图）。木手柄的底部安装在镰刀上面（镰刀上穿有六个孔用钉子钉在木手柄的底部），木夹子是由两根弯曲形的小木条制成，禾从木夹子前面进入中间，将禾挤成一把。木滚轮是用来在干田里滚动前进的，它可以稳定镰刀距离地面的高低。镰刀是用两块铁刀片构成，镰刀的刀口部分是锯齿形的（与旧式镰刀相同）并掺有钢，在安装镰刀时，应注意两点：1、两片镰刀基部相合的地方，必须靠紧无缝。2、木手柄底部与镰刀相衔接的中间，必须垫一块小铁片，以使镰刀能稳定的固定在木手柄上，以免因木质松软而使两块刀片张开。注意了这两点，就可避免堵藏稻草的现象发生。
    二、水田快速割禾器
    这种快速割禾器也是衡南县鸡笼街乡农具厂改进成功的。适合在水田里使用。凡立起的禾和倒伏不严重的禾都可用这种快速割禾器。其构造与第一种基本上相同，所不同的是木手柄上没有安装木滚轮，而是安装一块船形底板（见图）。它的作用是可在水田里滑动前进，并能稳定镰刀距离地面的高低。
    三、倒伏快速割禾器
    这种快速割禾器也是衡南县鸡笼街乡农具厂改进成功的。适合割倒伏的禾。如在干田里使用，可按照第一种式样做一个木滚轮；如在水田里使用，可按第二种式样做一个船形底板。其余构造与第一种基本上相同。所不同的地方是在木夹子的侧面（左右侧面都可以）安装一个“弓形扶禾架”（见图），使用中向前推进时，倒伏的禾顺着“弓形扶禾架”立起并进入木夹子中间，成为一把。
    四、弹簧夹禾快速割禾器
    这种快速割禾器是衡阳汽车修配厂黄正扬同志改进成功的。适合在干田与水田中使用。凡立起的禾和倒伏较严重的禾，都可以使用这种快速割禾器。其形状与第一种有些不同。构造分为木手柄、弹簧、镰刀、活动木夹子等四部分（见图）。木手柄的底部安装在镰刀上面，弹簧安装在木手柄和木夹子上面。弹簧?紧活动木夹子时能使禾挤成一把，松开时能将它卸在地上。镰刀是一块人字形的刀片，上面有锯齿，中间有一条曲槽和一个圆孔，稻草通过曲槽和圆孔漏掉，可避免稻草在镰刀上堵藏。
    以上四种快速割禾器，以前面三种推广得最多，第四种因构造较复杂，推广较少。关于快速割禾器的使用方法，应注意掌握如下几点：第一、凡是割未倒伏的禾，应选择行子直的一边收割。凡是禾倒伏程度不超过三十五度的，收割的方法可以顺着倒伏的方向收割，也可以按照倒伏的方向横割。凡是超过了三十五度的，则应按照倒伏的方向横割。倒伏程度很严重的，可以采用倒伏快速割禾器收割。第二、在使用中，镰刀的高低要严格掌握，镰刀应平地面收割，如太高了，则割不断。如太低了，则会铲入泥中。第三、在收割中，如发现有未割断的禾蔸倒在镰刀下面，必须加以清理后再继续收割，否则，将会连续发生割不断的现象，并增加推动的阻力。第四、快速割禾器向前推进的速度，以快一些为好，如果太慢了，则不易割断，工效也会不高。第五、使用时，两手抓住木手柄向前推进，一次可割一行，当禾进入木夹子中间之后，用手将禾把子拿出，或将快速割禾器立起用脚踩掉，一般一次可割十多蔸。（原载新湖南报）
