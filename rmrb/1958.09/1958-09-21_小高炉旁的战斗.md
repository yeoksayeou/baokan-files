The Battle by the Small Blast Furnace
Qinghua University Zhou Bangning

September 7th, a day of battle.

The ranks of the Tsinghua Special Forces Combat Division marched mightily towards Tiananmen Square, filled with anger towards the American aggressors, and with the determination of Chinese youth to liberate their homeland and defend peace in the Far East and the world, to receive the Motherland's review.

At this moment, the new workers of the Tsinghua small blast furnace workshop were worried. The small blast furnace had to produce iron; the communist construction projects throughout Tsinghua Garden needed a large amount of iron. The leadership had long explained clearly to everyone: the people at the small blast furnace cannot leave for even half a step! Anger in the workers' hearts turned into soaring drive. At the oath-taking meeting, Communist Youth League Branch Secretary Lao Jin, his face flushed, waved his fist and shouted:

"Although we are not participating in the parade, standing by the small blast furnace is standing in the ranks of the demonstration. Molten iron is ammunition!"

"Increase iron production, strike at the American imperialists!"

Instantly, the shouts at the meeting shook the sky. This was the steel determination of all the small blast furnace workers.

Fighting into the night, Tsinghua Garden had already fallen into a sweet sleep; only this red night pearl on the square east of the railway was still shining, emitting a huge roar. Under the bright lights, the hard-fighting people were busy preparing everything for tapping the iron. The fire inside the furnace was blazing, and the temperature of the molten iron was rising smoothly...

In an instant, a gale rose, followed by thunder and lightning, and pouring rain.

Suddenly, the lights all went out, and the blower stopped; a tense shout:

"The power is out!" This was Xiao Zhao's voice.

The originally orderly construction site, people were a little flustered because of the fate of the molten iron. Originally, if the small blast furnace stopped blowing, the molten iron and slag would mix together, and after cooling, it would cause the molten iron to freeze in the furnace, and the entire small blast furnace would face a state of paralysis. Also, because the air inside the furnace could not circulate, overheating would cause the hot blast stove to explode. In this serious situation, Lao Jin's order came:

"Open the taphole! Act immediately!"

The sledgehammer hammered the iron bar like raindrops. People didn't even wear gloves, and the hot coke fell on the back of their hands like needles piercing them. Xiao Zhao had just covered the machines and oxygen cylinders next to the furnace with his own clothes, when he suddenly shouted again:

"The top of the furnace! Open the charging bell!"

"Already done!" someone on top of the furnace answered.

It turned out that as soon as the accident occurred, Communist Youth League member Xiao Yuan was ordered to quickly climb to the top of the furnace, and now he was valiantly guarding the open furnace mouth with an iron rod.

The workers who were rescuing the small blast furnace were already like drowned rats, but in the constant heroic slogans of "Rescuing molten iron for the liberation of Taiwan!" and "Turning anger into drive!" the fighters were all high-spirited, and the sledgehammer swung non-stop. When one person was tired, others immediately replaced him.

The taphole was finally opened, and the red molten iron flowed out, like a fire snake rushing along the channel. The small blast furnace succumbed to the fighters. The fighters, who had been exhausted, then gathered around the furnace and cheered. Suddenly, the lights around them came on.

"The power is back!" Another burst of jubilation, the engine roared again, as if playing a triumphal song for the victorious fighters.

    小高炉旁的战斗
    清华大学　周邦宁
    9月7日，一个战斗的日子。
    清华特种兵战斗师的队伍浩浩荡荡地向天安门进发了，带着对美国侵略者的满腔愤怒，带着中国青年解放祖国领土，保卫远东和世界和平的决心去接受祖国的检阅。
    这会儿，可急坏了清华小高炉车间的新工人们。小高炉要出铁；清华园各处的共产主义建设工程需要大量的铁，领导上早就向大家解释清楚了：小高炉的人不能离开半步啊！愤怒在工人心中化成了冲天干劲。誓师大会上，共青团支部书记老金涨红了脸，挥着拳头高喊：
    “虽然我们没参加游行，站在小高炉旁也就是站在示威的行列里，铁水就是炮弹！”
    “增产铁水，打击美帝！”
    顿时，会场上吼声震天，这是全体小高炉工人的钢铁决心。
    战斗到深夜，清华园早已酣睡了；只有铁路以东广场上这颗红色夜明珠还在闪光，发出巨响。通明的灯光下，苦战的人们在忙碌着出铁的一切准备工作，炉内火势正旺，铁水温度顺利地上升……。
    刹那间，狂风突起，接着是雷鸣闪电，大雨倾盆而下。
    突然，灯光都灭了，鼓风机停响了；一声紧张的呼喊：
    “电断了！”这是小赵的声音。
    本来秩序井然的工地，人们都由于耽心铁水的命运而显得有些慌乱了。原来，小高炉一停风，铁水和炉渣混在一起，冷却后，就会引起炉内铁水冻结，整个小高炉就面临着瘫痪的状态。又因炉内空气不得流通，由于过热，还会引起热风机爆炸。在这种严重形势下，传来老金的命令：
    “打出铁口！马上行动！”
    大锤像雨点般敲着铁杆，人们手套也没戴上，灼热的焦炭落在手背上像针猛扎一般。小赵刚用自己的衣服把炉旁机器、氧气瓶盖牢，忽然又直喊：
    “炉顶！打开料钟！”
    “早好了！”炉顶有人回答。
    原来，事故刚发生，共青团员小袁就奉令迅速登上了炉顶，现在正手执铁棍威武地守卫着敞开的炉口。
    抢救小高炉的工人们早就像落汤鸡似的了，可是在不断的“为解放台湾抢救铁水！”、“化愤怒为干劲！”等的英勇口号声中，战士们个个志气昂扬，大锤不间断地抡舞，一个人累了，其他人就马上换上去。
    出铁口终于打开了，通红的铁水流出来了，像一条火蛇顺着型道奔窜，小高炉向战士们屈服了。早已疲乏了的战士们这时都围着炉子欢呼起来。突然，四周灯也亮了。
    “来电了！”又是一片欢腾，发动机又嗡嗡地叫起来了，仿佛是在为胜利了的战士们奏起凯歌。
