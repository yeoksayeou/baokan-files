Xinhua News Agency Report from Paris: French Prime Minister de Gaulle went to some major French cities, including Rennes, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, and Lille, on the 20th and 21st to campaign for his dictatorial draft "constitution." He delivered speeches in these cities, attempting to deceive the residents of these places into supporting his dictatorial draft "constitution."

French police authorities took strict measures in all the cities de Gaulle visited to prevent democratic forces and Algerians residing in France from holding demonstrations against de Gaulle. For example, in Rennes, the police searched local hotels before de Gaulle's arrival and drove most of the Algerian residents out of the city.

Despite this, demonstrations against de Gaulle's dictatorial draft "constitution" still occurred in every city de Gaulle visited.

In Rennes, when de Gaulle was delivering a speech in the central square, a group of people whistled and shouted slogans to express their opposition to de Gaulle's dictatorial draft "constitution." As de Gaulle was leaving the Rennes City Hall, a person approached the car and questioned de Gaulle face to face, and the police arrested this person.

In Bordeaux, when de Gaulle was delivering a speech, some people also shouted "No." People who opposed de Gaulle's draft "constitution" were later attacked by the police and de Gaulle's supporters, and many people were unreasonably arrested.

Republicans in Strasbourg and Lille released large balloons when de Gaulle arrived, with large banners reading "No" hanging from the balloons. In Lille, there were also incidents of fascists attacking the masses who opposed de Gaulle's speech.

In addition, some people in France showed indifference to the "referendum." According to official statistics, 1.7 million voters in mainland France have not yet registered. During his speeches in the four cities this time, de Gaulle repeatedly asked people not to stay at home and not vote, attempting to mobilize these people to come out and support him.

The French people's movement against de Gaulle's draft "constitution" is continuing to develop.

Not only have many trade union organizations repeatedly issued strong calls against de Gaulle's "constitution," but also peasant organizations and agricultural figures have called for voting against the "constitution" draft. The Peasants' Committee for the Defence of Peace and Agriculture issued a statement calling on all peasants to carefully consider the meaning of this vote.

In Haute-Vienne, thirty well-known figures in the agricultural sector issued an open letter to farmers, asking all agricultural operators to recognize the serious danger that de Gaulle's "constitution" brings to agriculture. In Hérault, forty-six well-known figures in the agricultural sector – including many mayors – issued an appeal to the province's grape growers and agricultural operators, asking them to vote against it in the "referendum."

Pierre Cot, the leader of the Progressive Republican Union, delivered a speech on the radio on the evening of the 22nd, calling for a vote against on September 28th. Joseph Bellec, a spokesperson for the Democratic Socialist Resistance Union, also called for a vote against de Gaulle's "constitution" in a radio speech.

In addition, the National Committee of University Circles for the Defense of the Republic held a rally in the Hall of the Scientists' Association on the 22nd against de Gaulle's draft "constitution." In Creuse, more than fifty well-known figures, including Communists, Socialists, and Radical Socialists, jointly issued an appeal calling on all Republicans in the province to take immediate action to block the personal dictatorship and to defend the Republic.

On the other hand, fascists who are plotting to establish a military dictatorship in France are constantly provoking progressives, trying their best to create a atmosphere of terror for the upcoming "referendum."

Meanwhile, in Marseille, 10,000 Republicans responded to the call of the Republican Action Vigilance Committee on the 20th and participated in a grand rally against de Gaulle's constitution and uniting Republicans.

At the same time, the congress of the Railway Workers' Federation of the Catholic Labor Confederation passed a resolution, emphasizing the dangers posed by this draft constitution. The Vigilance Committee of Republican Legal Scholars also passed a resolution condemning de Gaulle's constitution and requesting all Republicans to unite and vote against this constitution. In addition, the National Anti-Fascist Committee of Students, uniting the French Jewish Students' Union and students from the French Radical Party, left-wing Socialist students, and Communist students, called on all university circles to vote against de Gaulle's constitution in the referendum.

    戴高乐四出拉票到处碰壁
    法国公众反对独裁宪法声势日大
    本报综合报道据新华社讯  巴黎消息：法国总理戴高乐20日和21日到勒纳、波尔多、斯特拉斯堡和里尔等法国一些大城市为他的独裁“宪法”草案进行活动。他在这些城市发表了演说，企图骗取这些地方的居民支持他的独裁“宪法”草案。
    法国警察当局在戴高乐所到的各城市都采取了严密的措施，来防止民主力量和侨居法国的阿尔及利亚人举行反对戴高乐的示威。例如在勒纳，警察在戴高乐到达前搜查了当地的旅馆，并且把当地的大部分阿尔及利亚居民赶出了市区。
    尽管如此，在戴高乐所到达的各个城市里仍然都发生了反对戴高乐独裁“宪法”草案的示威。
    在勒纳，当戴高乐在中央广场发表演说的时候，有一批人吹着口哨和高呼口号，表示反对戴高乐的独裁“宪法”草案。在戴高乐离开勒纳市政厅的时候，有一个人走近汽车当面诘问戴高乐，警察逮捕了这个人。
    在波尔多，当戴高乐发表演说的时候，也有人大声叫“不”。反对戴高乐“宪法”草案的人后来受到警察和戴高乐分子的袭击，并且有很多人被无理逮捕。
    斯特拉斯堡和里尔的共和人士都在戴高乐到达的时候放出了大气球，气球上挂了写着“不”字的大标语。在里尔，也发生了法西斯分子袭击反对戴高乐演说的群众的事件。
    此外，法国有一部分人对“公民投票”表示冷淡，据官方统计，法国本土就有一百七十万选民还没有登记。戴高乐这一次在四个城市演说时曾再三要求人们不要留在家中不去投票，企图动员这些人出来支持他。
    法国人民反对戴高乐“宪法”草案的运动正在继续发展。
    不仅许多工会组织一再发出了强烈地反对戴高乐“宪法”的呼声，而且农民组织和农业界人士也纷纷呼吁投票反对“宪法”草案。农民保卫和平和农业全国委员会发表了一项声明，号召全体农民仔细思量这次投票的含义。
    在上维也纳省，三十个农业界著名人士发出告农民书，要求所有的农业经营者认识戴高乐“宪法”给农业带来的严重危险。在爱尔罗省，由四十六个农业界著名人士——其中有许多市长——向该省的葡萄种植者和农业经营者发出呼吁，要求他们在“公民投票”时投反对票。
    进步共和联盟领袖比埃尔·戈特22日晚上在广播电台发表演说，号召在9月28日投反对票。民主社会抵抗联盟发言人约瑟夫·贝朗也在广播演说中号召对戴高乐“宪法”投反对票。
    此外，大学界保卫共和国全国委员会22日在科学家协会大厅举行了反对戴高乐“宪法”草案的集会。在克勒斯省，包括共产党人、社会党人、激进社会党人在内的五十多个著名人士也联名发出呼吁书，号召全省的共和人士为堵塞个人独裁政权、为保卫共和国而立即行动。
    另一方面，阴谋在法国建立军事独裁的法西斯分子在不断向进步人士挑衅，竭力为即将举行的“公民投票”制造恐怖气氛。
    同时，在马赛，一万名共和人士20日响应共和行动警惕委员会的号召，参加了反对戴高乐宪法、团结共和人士的盛大集会。
    同时，天主教劳工联盟铁路工人联合会代表大会通过一项决议，强调指出这个宪法草案所形成的危险。共和法学界人士警惕委员会也通过决议，斥责戴高乐宪法，并要求全体共和人士团结一致投票反对这个宪法。此外，团结着法国犹太学生联合会和法国激进党学生、社会党左翼学生以及共产党学生的学生反法西斯全国委员会，号召全体大学界人士在公民投票时投票反对戴高乐宪法。
