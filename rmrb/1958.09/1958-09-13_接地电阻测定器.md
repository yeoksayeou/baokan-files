Ground Resistance Tester

    This newspaper reports that the Electromechanical Teaching and Research Group of the Jixi Coal Mine School recently trial-produced a ground resistance tester after four days and nights of arduous research. After testing, the error does not exceed plus or minus 10%.

    For several years, the Jixi Mining Bureau has only had one imported ground resistance tester, which is used by various mines in rotation, which is very inconvenient, especially during major overhauls, which seriously affects work.

    To this end, with the support of the school Party committee, all comrades of the Electromechanical Teaching and Research Group broke the conservative idea that "teachers should only teach and not invent and create," and used existing materials to make a ground resistance tester.

    接地电阻测定器
    本报讯　最近鸡西煤矿学校机电教研组经过四昼夜苦战钻研，试制成功接地电阻测定器。经过检验，误差不超过正负10％。
    几年来，鸡西矿务局只有一台进口的接地电阻测定器，供各矿轮流使用，很不方便，尤其在大检修时，严重影响工作。
    为此，在校党委支持下，机电教研组全体同志打破了“教师只管教课，不能发明创造”的保守思想，利用现有材料制成了接地电阻测定器。
