    The Last Glimmer of the Dying French Colonial Empire
    ——On the de Gaulle Regime and its Future
    Zhang Fan
    More than three months ago, de Gaulle, who had been forced into "retirement" for twelve years, relied on military rebellion forces, wearing a "legal" cloak, to return to power. This is by no means a common cabinet change in France, but marks the beginning of one state form of bourgeois rule replacing another. No matter how much the de Gaulle regime tries to gloss over it, it cannot hide its increasingly obvious essence of military personal dictatorship, and it is paving the way for pushing France further towards fascism. This means that France's bourgeois republican system will gradually be replaced by the bourgeoisie's open fascist dictatorship. Therefore, de Gaulle's rise to power is a major turning point in French political life.

    However, due to the strength of the French working class, the lack of a broad mass base for fascism in France, the heavy contradictions between bourgeois parties with a tradition of multi-party systems, and the prevailing trend of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, the de Gaulle regime is unable to completely abandon the form of the bourgeois republican system all at once, and has to take a roundabout approach, mixing fascist dictatorship with the most false forms of bourgeois parliamentary democracy. However, this does not change the nature of the de Gaulle regime – gradually moving towards fascist personal dictatorship. The "new constitution" drafted by de Gaulle and submitted to a referendum on September 28 is an important step towards fascism. This "constitution" grants the president unlimited power, the cabinet will in fact be completely at the president's command, the parliament will be reduced to an ornament of personal dictatorship, and the republican system will exist in name only. But the fascist forces are not satisfied with this. The Algerian rioters openly stated that this "constitution" is only "transitional" and that the regime established under this "constitution" is also "transitional." Obviously, the purpose of the fascist forces is to pass the "new constitution" under the guise of public opinion in order to legalize the personal dictatorship regime, so as to facilitate the further implementation of fascist policies.

    De Gaulle's return is not only the result of the rapid development of domestic class contradictions in France after the war, but also a reflection of the current situation of imperialism's dying struggle and the collapse of the colonial system. French imperialism, weakened by the profound colonial rule crisis and long-term colonial wars, is the weakest link in the imperialist system. Fascist forces are particularly rampant in this weak link and have begun to establish a personal dictatorship regime that is gradually moving towards fascism, which precisely shows the weakness of French imperialism and its inability to continue to rely on the so-called "middle" parties of the bourgeoisie to control the situation, and its inability to maintain the bourgeois dictatorship by means of the old bourgeois democracy.

    The serious political crisis caused by the colonial war policy pursued by the French ruling group in the post-war period, especially in recent years, is the basic reason for the de Gaulle regime. Ignoring the vigorous development of the national liberation movement, the French ruling group attempted to block the tide of national independence with intensified military repression, and carried out continuous colonial wars. The eight-year-long "dirty" war in Indochina has just ended with the defeat of French imperialism, and French colonialists have ignited the flames of war in North Africa. The Algerian war, which has lasted for nearly four years, is still expanding, and then there was the shameful war of aggression against Egypt. Protracted colonial wars have not only failed to reverse the inevitable decline of the French colonial empire, but have accelerated its collapse. French imperialism has repeatedly lost its positions in the Middle East, the Far East and North Africa.

    Continuous colonial wars, especially the Algerian war and the ensuing financial difficulties, have put the French ruling group in a very embarrassing situation both internally and externally. France's international status has continued to decline, its domestic political situation has been turbulent, and its colonial rule has been in jeopardy. The disputes and contradictions between the various parties of the French bourgeoisie have intensified, and the gap between the ruling group and the people has become increasingly wide. The French ruling group has been unable to alleviate or get rid of the political crisis by means of the usual cabinet changes. The problem facing the ruling group is no longer to determine who or which parties should come out to form a cabinet, but how to deal with the unavoidable political crisis and how to continue to maintain its rule. The chaos of the French political situation before and after the fall of the Gaillard government concentratedly reflected this situation.

    In this desperate situation, the French ruling group tried to establish a fascist-style regime in order to take strong policies to stabilize the domestic and colonial rule and maintain France's declining international status. The fascist forces, which had already expanded their strength in the long-term colonial wars, emerged as the times required and brought de Gaulle to power. The de Gaulle regime is in fact a regime of extreme reactionary elements of the French bourgeoisie and extreme colonialists. The social forces supporting de Gaulle are mainly the big colonialists in North Africa and the colonial-financial groups in the mainland, as well as the colonial army with strong fascist tendencies.

    In the serious moment of the May Incident, the French Communist Party issued a fighting call to defend the Republic and mobilized the broad masses of the people to carry out a massive struggle, but this struggle finally failed to prevent de Gaulle from coming to power. What is the reason? This is primarily due to the betrayal policy of the right-wing leadership group of the French Socialist Party, which divided the working class and democratic forces. At the critical moment when de Gaulle attempted to usurp power by means of a military coup, the right-wing leadership group of the Socialist Party tried its best to split the anti-fascist forces, prohibiting party members from taking unified action with the Communists; Mollet and his like clamored "rather have de Gaulle than the People's Front," and did their best to run around and serve de Gaulle's rise to power, and used deceptive and threatening means to disintegrate the forces within the party that opposed de Gaulle. The Socialist Party's right-wing leadership group's betrayal and surrender played an important role in the success of de Gaulle's conspiracy to usurp power. Now, Mollet and his ilk are working hard to promote de Gaulle's dictatorial "constitution," making every effort to embellish and defend de Gaulle, and manipulating the voting machine to force the recent Socialist Party congress to pass a resolution supporting the dictatorial constitution. All this irrefutably shows that the right-wing Socialist Party is the most loyal slave of the bourgeoisie.

    The despicable act of the Socialist Party's right-wing leadership group in pledging allegiance to de Gaulle and burying the Republic aroused the indignation and dissatisfaction of the broad masses of party members. The day after the end of the party congress, minority leaders Depreux, Mayer, and Vedier announced their withdrawal from the Socialist Party and the establishment of an independent Socialist Party. The formal split of the Socialist Party marked the bankruptcy of the right-wing leadership group's policy of surrendering to the fascist forces. More and more Socialist Party masses have realized that only by resolutely struggling against the right-wing leadership's surrender policy and divisive policy can the road to fascism be effectively blocked.

    De Gaulle was able to come to power also by taking advantage of the chauvinistic sentiments of some middle and small bourgeois masses who were incited by fascist reactionary propaganda, the people's dissatisfaction with successive bourgeois governments' subordination to the United States and betrayal of national interests, the weariness and hatred of the corruption and incompetence of bourgeois parties and the long-term instability of the political situation, and the dissatisfaction with the deteriorating domestic financial and economic situation and the sharp deterioration of living standards.

    De Gaulle tried his best to use various hypocritical postures and sweet words to confuse and win over the masses, disguising himself as France's "savior" and the "renovator" of the republican system, flaunting the banner of anti-Japanese war "hero" and the founder of the Fourth Republic. De Gaulle tried his best to make things seem like this: it seemed that he had no intention of burying the Republic, but to establish a strong and stable government that would be sufficient to make France "revive," and that only he could protect the "republican" system from the threat of fascist rioters. The shameless praise of de Gaulle by the right-wing leadership group of the Socialist Party and some bourgeois so-called "middle" parties made it easier for de Gaulle to play this deceptive trick.

    But the fox's tail cannot be hidden. If de Gaulle's rise to power had temporarily caused some illusions among a section of the masses, especially among the urban and rural middle and small bourgeoisie, then de Gaulle's "achievements" in the past three months and the constitution he proposed to bury the Republic have begun to reveal his true colors, thus making these illusions begin to vanish. Facts have proved that the de Gaulle government, in accordance with the will of the extreme colonialists, has dragged France onto the desperate road of intensifying the Algerian war; domestically, it is depriving the broad masses of the people of the most basic democratic and freedom rights and intensifying its attack on the living standards of the working people; in foreign affairs, the "independence" and "national revival" boasted by de Gaulle are nothing but empty words of deception hanging on his lips. De Gaulle sometimes makes some "independent" gestures that are irrelevant to the overall situation, but only to bargain with the United States and confuse the masses, and in fact still acts according to the United States' wishes.

    Although the French people's struggle failed to prevent de Gaulle from coming to power, it greatly promoted the unity of the working class and democratic forces, enhanced the awareness of the broad masses of the people, and created favorable conditions for launching a more magnificent struggle. Now the French people are conducting a broad struggle to reject the dictatorial constitution, and "saying 'no' to de Gaulle" has become the French people's fighting slogan.

    The French people's strong opposition to personal dictatorship and fascism has made de Gaulle feel that it is difficult to pass the dictatorial constitution under the guise of public opinion, so he has had to take a series of more blatant means of intimidation and deception in order to impose the dictatorial constitution on the French people. One of de Gaulle's vicious conspiracies is to force the people of the colonies to participate in the referendum to decide the French constitution, attempting to obtain millions of extra votes of approval with lies and bayonets. However, the tide of the colonial people's firm demand for independence has disrupted de Gaulle's wishful thinking. De Gaulle attempted to use bayonets to force the Algerian people to participate in the referendum and accept the constitution that would make Algeria "one with" France. The Algerian people responded to de Gaulle by further strengthening the struggle. The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria was an even heavier blow to de Gaulle. De Gaulle attempted to peddle his unpopular constitution in Black Africa by means of a combination of intimidation and inducement, but as a result, he encountered powerful mass demonstrations demanding independence everywhere. French Guinea, Niger, and some other regions have indicated that they will vote against the constitution and thus secede from France and become independent.

    The current international and domestic situations are both unfavorable to the de Gaulle regime and favorable to the people's forces. First of all, the colonial system is collapsing and the national liberation movement is surging. The victory of the Iraqi revolution and the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria have set off a new upsurge in the national liberation movement in the Middle East and Africa. The de Gaulle regime's intensified colonial policy will inevitably be badly battered, thus further accelerating the collapse of the French colonial empire. Secondly, domestic class struggle is intensifying, the middle forces are further disintegrating, and the progressive forces are growing stronger. As the reactionary face of the de Gaulle regime is increasingly exposed and the colonial war further deepens the domestic financial and economic difficulties, the domestic balance of class forces will undergo more profound changes that are unfavorable to the de Gaulle regime. Thirdly, imperialism is dying, the East Wind is further prevailing over the West Wind, and the people's forces are further prevailing over the reactionary forces. The perverse actions of the French fascist forces will only accelerate their own demise.

    In short, the current rampant French fascist forces are only the last glimmer of the dying French colonial empire, which can neither reverse the inevitable decline of the French colonial empire, nor can it reverse the historical trend of the French people moving towards progress. To take a step back, even if the dictatorial constitution is passed, the de Gaulle regime cannot be stable. It is nothing more than a regime built on a volcano. The French people's struggle for democracy and freedom and the colonial people's struggle for independence will merge together, and at any time may turn this personal dictatorship regime, which runs counter to the spirit of the times and the will of the people, into ashes.

    法兰西殖民帝国没落的回光反照
    ——关于戴高乐政权及其前途
    张帆
    三个多月前，被迫“隐退”了十二年的戴高乐，依靠军事暴乱力量、披着“合法”外衣重新上台。这决不是法国司空见惯的通常的内阁更迭，而是标志着资产阶级统治的一种国家形式代替另一种国家形式的开端。戴高乐政权无论怎样涂脂抹粉，都不能掩盖它愈来愈明显的军事个人独裁的本质，它正在为把法国进一步推向法西斯开辟道路。这就意味着法国的资产阶级共和制度将逐步为资产阶级公开的法西斯专政所代替。因此，戴高乐的上台是法国政治生活的一个重大的转折点。
    但是，由于法国工人阶级力量的强大，由于法西斯在法国没有广泛的群众基础，由于具有多党制传统的资产阶级党派之间矛盾重重，再加上东风压倒西风的时代条件，戴高乐政权无力一下子彻底抛弃资产阶级共和制度的形式，不得不采取迂回曲折的办法，将法西斯专政同最虚假的资产阶级议会民主形式混合运用。但是，这一点丝毫不能改变戴高乐政权的性质——逐步走向法西斯的个人独裁。由戴高乐一手制订并将于9月28日提交公民投票表决的“新宪法”就是走向法西斯的一个重要步骤。这部“宪法”赋予总统以无限的权力，内阁实际上将完全听命于总统，议会则沦为个人独裁的装饰品，共和制度名存实亡。但法西斯势力并不以此为足，阿尔及利亚暴乱分子公开表示，这部“宪法”只是“过渡性”的，根据这一“宪法”建立的政权也是“过渡性”的。显然，法西斯势力的目的在于假借民意通过“新宪法”，以便使个人独裁政权合法化，从而便于进一步推行法西斯政策。
    戴高乐卷土重来，不仅是战后法国国内阶级矛盾急剧发展的结果，而且是当前帝国主义垂死挣扎、殖民制度土崩瓦解这种形势的反映。被深刻的殖民统治危机和长期的殖民战争削弱了的法帝国主义是帝国主义体系最薄弱的环节。法西斯势力在这一薄弱的环节特别嚣张，并且开始建立了逐步走向法西斯的个人独裁政权，这恰恰表明了法帝国主义的软弱，表明它无法继续依靠资产阶级所谓“中间”党派控制局面，无法用旧的资产阶级民主的手段来维持资产阶级专政。
    法国统治集团在战后时期，特别是最近几年来奉行的殖民战争政策所引起的严重的政治危机，是导致戴高乐政权的基本原因。法国统治集团无视民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，企图以变本加厉的军事镇压阻挡民族独立的潮流，进行了连年不绝的殖民战争。持续八年之久的印度支那“肮脏”战争刚以法帝国主义的失败而告终，法国殖民者又在北非燃起了战火，历时将近四年的阿尔及利亚战争至今还在继续扩大中，随后又进行了可耻的侵埃战争。旷日持久的殖民战争非但未能挽回法兰西殖民帝国必然没落的命运，反而在加速它的崩溃。法帝国主义接二连三地丧失了它在中东、远东和北非的阵地。
    连年不绝的殖民战争，特别是阿尔及利亚战争和随之而来的财政困难，使法国统治集团的内外处境十分狼狈。法国国际地位不断下降，国内政局动荡不定，殖民统治地位岌岌可危。法国资产阶级各党之间的争吵和矛盾日益加剧，统治集团同人民群众之间的鸿沟愈来愈深。法国统治集团已经无法用通常的更迭内阁的办法来缓和或摆脱政治危机，统治集团所面临的问题已经不再是确定由谁或由哪些政党出来组阁的问题，而是如何应付无法摆脱的政治危机和如何继续维持统治的问题。盖伊阿政府倒台前后法国政局混乱，就集中反映了这种形势。
    在这种山穷水尽的形势下，法国统治集团力图建立一种法西斯式的政权，以便采取强力政策来稳定国内和殖民地的统治地位，并且保住法国江河日下的国际地位。早已在长期的殖民战争中扩展了自己力量的法西斯势力就应运而起，捧戴高乐上台。戴高乐政权实际上是法国资产阶级极端反动分子和极端殖民主义分子的政权，支持戴高乐的社会势力，主要是北非的大殖民主和本土的殖民—金融财团以及具有强烈的法西斯倾向的殖民军队。
    在五月事变的严重的时刻里，法国共产党发出了保卫共和国的战斗号召，动员了广大人民进行声势浩大的斗争，但这一斗争终于未能阻止戴高乐上台。原因何在？这首先是由于法国社会党右翼领导集团的叛卖政策而使工人阶级和民主力量陷于分裂的缘故。在戴高乐企图挟持军事政变篡夺政权的紧要关头，社会党右翼领导集团竭力分裂反法西斯力量，禁止党员群众同共产党人采取统一行动；摩勒之流叫嚷“宁愿要戴高乐，不要人民阵线”，竭力为戴高乐上台奔走效劳，并以欺骗威胁手段瓦解党内反对戴高乐的力量。戴高乐篡夺政权的阴谋之所以得逞，社会党右翼领导集团的叛卖和投降起了重要的作用。现在，摩勒之流又在为戴高乐推销独裁“宪法”大卖力气，为戴高乐百般粉饰辩解，并操纵表决机器强使最近召开的社会党代表大会通过支持独裁宪法的决议。这一切都无可辩驳地表明，右翼社会党乃是资产阶级的最忠实的奴仆。
    社会党右翼领导集团这种效忠戴高乐埋葬共和国的卑鄙行径激起了广大党员群众的愤慨和不满。在党代表大会结束的第二天，少数派领袖德普勒、麦耶、维迪埃等已宣布退出社会党，另行成立独立社会党。社会党的正式分裂标志着右翼领导集团向法西斯势力投降政策的破产。越来越多的社会党群众认识到，只有同右翼领导的投降政策和分裂政策作坚决的斗争，才能有效地堵塞法西斯的道路。
    戴高乐之所以能上台，还利用了一部分受法西斯反动宣传煽惑的中小资产阶级群众的沙文主义情绪和人民群众对历届资产阶级政府屈从美国、出卖民族利益的不满，对资产阶级政党腐败无能、政局长期动荡不定的厌倦和憎恶，以及对国内财政经济情况每况愈下、生活急剧恶化的不满情绪。
    戴高乐竭力以各种伪善姿态和花言巧语迷惑和笼络群众，把自己打扮成法国的“救星”和共和制度的“革新者”，以抗战“英雄”和第四共和国开创人的招牌到处招摇撞骗。戴高乐竭力把事情说成这样：似乎他毫无埋葬共和国之意，而是要建立一个足以使法兰西“复兴”的强有力的稳定的政府，似乎只有他才能维护“共和”制度免受法西斯暴乱分子的威胁。社会党右翼领导集团以及一些资产阶级所谓“中间”党派对戴高乐厚颜无耻的捧场，更便于戴高乐玩弄这种欺骗手法。
    但是狐狸尾巴是藏不住的。如果说，戴高乐的上台曾经在一部分群众中特别是城乡中小资产阶级中间暂时引起某些幻想，那么，戴高乐三个多月来的“政绩”和他提出的埋葬共和国的宪法，已经开始显露出他的真面目，从而使这些幻想开始烟消云散。事实证明：戴高乐政府禀承极端殖民主义分子的意志已经把法国拖上了加剧阿尔及利亚战争的绝望的道路；在国内，它正在剥夺广大人民最起码的民主自由权利，加紧向劳动人民的生活水平进攻；在外交方面，戴高乐所标榜的“独立”、“民族复兴”不过是挂在嘴边的骗人的空话，戴高乐有时作出一些无关大局的“独立”姿态，也只是为了同美国讨价还价和迷惑群众，实际上还是看美国的眼色行事。
    法国人民的斗争虽然未能阻止戴高乐上台，但它大大促进了工人阶级和民主力量的团结，提高了广大人民的觉悟，为掀起更加波澜壮阔的斗争创造了有利条件。现在法国人民正在为否决独裁宪法而进行广泛的斗争，“向戴高乐说：‘不’”，已成为法国人民的战斗口号。
    法国人民强烈反对个人独裁，反对法西斯，使戴高乐感到要假借民意通过独裁宪法困难重重，于是就不得不采取一系列更加露骨的恫吓、欺骗手段，以便将独裁宪法强加在法国人民头上。戴高乐恶毒的阴谋之一，就是硬要殖民地人民参加决定法国宪法的公民投票，企图用谎言和刺刀取得几百万张额外的赞成票。但是，殖民地人民坚决要求独立的浪潮打乱了戴高乐的如意算盘。戴高乐企图用刺刀迫使阿尔及利亚人民参加公民投票，接受使阿尔及利亚同法国“合为一体”的宪法，阿尔及利亚人民以进一步加强战斗来回答戴高乐，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立对戴高乐说来更是一个沉重的打击。戴高乐企图用威吓和诱骗兼施的手段在黑非洲兜售他的不得人心的宪法，结果却处处遇到要求独立的强大的群众示威，法属几内亚、尼日尔和其他一些地区已经表示要投票反对宪法，从而脱离法国而独立。
    目前国际和国内形势都是不利于戴高乐政权而有利于人民力量的。首先，殖民体系土崩瓦解，民族解放运动风起云涌。伊拉克革命的胜利和阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立掀起了中东和非洲民族解放运动的新高潮，戴高乐政权的变本加厉的殖民政策必将碰得头破血流，从而进一步加速法殖民帝国的崩溃。其次，国内阶级斗争日益激化，中间力量进一步分化，进步力量日益壮大。随着戴高乐政权的反动面目日益暴露和殖民战争使国内财政经济困难的进一步加深，国内阶级力量对比将发生更加不利于戴高乐政权的深刻变化。再次，帝国主义日暮途穷，东风进一步压倒西风，人民力量进一步压倒反动力量。法国法西斯势力的倒行逆施只会加速自己的灭亡。
    总之，目前法国法西斯势力猖狂一时，只不过是法兰西殖民帝国没落的回光反照，这既不可能挽回法殖民帝国必然没落的命运，更不可能扭转法国人民走向进步的历史趋势。退一步说，即令独裁宪法获得通过，戴高乐政权也不可能是稳固的，那也不过是建筑在火山口上的政权，法国人民争取民主自由的斗争和殖民地人民争取独立的斗争汇合在一起，随时都可能使这一同时代精神和人民意志背道而驰的个人独裁政权化为灰烬。
