甲：Haven't seen you in a while!
乙：That's right! Where are you coming from?
甲：I just took a long trip recently and came back from the United States.
乙：What did you go to the United States for?
甲：I am a reporter for the Intercontinental News Agency, where can't I go?
乙：What news did you cover in the United States?
甲：I interviewed U.S. Secretary of State Dulles.
乙：Oh! Are you friends with Dulles?
甲：（Anxiously）You're the one who's friends with Dulles! I'm a reporter, going to interview Dulles to see his attitude towards the People's Republic of China's announcement of its territorial sea regulations. I entered Dulles' office, and he was looking at a map.
乙：What's Dulles like?
甲：Hey! Don't even mention it, he's blind!
乙：（Surprised）Blind? Unbelievable.
甲：When he was looking at the map, his attendant official used a stick to point out to him that it was the People's Republic of China.
乙：What did he say?
甲：He shook his head and said, "This whole area is ocean. There is no mainland at all."
乙：Isn't the Chinese mainland colored red on the map? Can't he see it?
甲：Everyone in the world can see it, but he can't, isn't he blind! He's not only blind, but also deaf!
乙：Didn't his attendant official talk to him?
甲：No way! His attendant asked him to look at the map by pointing with a stick, without saying a word.
乙：Then how did you, as a reporter, interview him?
甲：I said: "Mr. Dulles: Do you know that the Chinese government has announced territorial sea regulations?"
乙：What was his reaction?
甲：He didn't hear anything and was still issuing orders to send U.S. warships to Jinmen and Mazu to deliver supplies to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. I asked again: "The government of the People's Republic of China has issued more than a dozen warnings about the U.S. invasion of its territorial waters and airspace. Did you hear that?" He continued to direct the transport of armed forces to Taiwan.
乙：Maybe he couldn't understand what you said.
甲：No. His ears are as deaf as stones. The radio in his room was broadcasting the roar of millions of people in front of Tiananmen Square against aggression, and the roar against aggression from all over China, but he didn't hear any of it.
乙：He couldn't hear such a loud noise, he's deaf, and very deaf!
甲：Not only deaf, but also lame!
乙：How do you know he's lame?
甲：Just as he was sitting there issuing orders, a military officer came in, flustered: "Report, Secretary of State, it's terrible! Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev said in his letter to the President that our warships can only be used as rocket target practice…"
乙：What happened?
甲：Dulles was frightened, he was so anxious that he pressed his hands on the table, trying to stand up, his upper body swayed twice but he couldn't stand up. He realized that he had lost a leg. He sighed again and sat down.
乙：He really is lame!
甲：It was broken in Korea by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.
乙：Wow, isn't this a special grade cripple?
甲：Not only is he a special grade cripple, but it looks like he won't live long.
乙：How so?
甲：He's mentally deranged.
乙：What are the signs?
甲：I discovered that he has special hobbies.
乙：Playing with pug dogs?
甲：No.
乙：Playing with antique jade artifacts?
甲：No. The things he plays with have never been played with by anyone.
乙：What exactly is it?
甲：It's a rope for strangling people.
乙：Someone plays with that? Using a noose as a jump rope?
甲：No, isn't that strange enough?
乙：Using a noose as a belt?
甲：Too ordinary, think again.
乙：I really can't figure it out.
甲：He plays by putting the noose around his neck.
乙：How is that fun!
甲：Each to their own! What's it to you?
乙：That's not playing, you could lose your life if you're not careful.
甲：There are many tricks! He not only puts the noose around his neck, but also finds someone to hold the other end of the noose.
乙：That's very dangerous!
甲：Not only dangerous, it's already certain that he won't live.
乙：How come?
甲：He will definitely strangle himself!
乙：You've determined that for him.
甲：Not me, his parents, the monopoly capitalists who gave birth to him, determined that long ago, so they gave him the name "Dulles," sooner or later he'll strangle himself.

    特级残废（相声）
    陶钝甲：有日子没见啦！乙：可不是吗！你从那里来？甲：我最近出了趟远门，刚从美国回来。乙：到美国去干啥？甲：我是洲际通讯社的记者，哪儿不能去？乙：你到美国采访一些什么新闻？甲：我访问了美国国务卿杜勒斯。乙：噢！你和杜勒斯是朋友啊？甲：（着急）你才和杜勒斯是朋友呢！我是记者，去访问杜勒斯，看看他对中华人民共和国宣布领海规定的态度。我进了杜勒斯的办公室，他正在看地图。乙：杜勒斯什么样儿？甲：嘿！别提了，他是一个瞎子！乙：（吃惊）是个瞎子？真想不到。甲：在看地图的时候，他的侍从文官用棒子指明给他那是中华人民共和国。乙：他说什么？甲：他摇着头说：“这一片统统是海洋。根本没有什么大陆。”乙：地图上的中国大陆不是染着红色吗，他看不见？甲：全世界人人都看见了，他却看不见，不是瞎子是什么！他不仅是瞎子，还是个聋子呢？乙：他的侍从文官不是和他说话了吗？甲：哪的话！他的侍从要他看地图是用棒子指着，连一个字也没说。乙：那你当记者的怎么访问他呀？甲：我说：“杜勒斯先生：中国政府宣布了领海规定你知道吗？”乙：他有什么表示？甲：他什么也没听见，还在那里下命令叫美国军舰向金门、马祖给蒋匪军运送东西。我又问：“中华人民共和国政府，对美国侵犯领海和领空提出了十几次的警告你听见没有？”他继续指挥向台湾运送武装部队。乙：也许你说的话他听不懂。甲：不。他的耳朵聋的和石头一样。他屋里的收音机放出天安门前百万群众反侵略的吼声，也放出中国全国各地反侵略的吼声，他一点也没有听见。乙：那么大的声音都听不见，那是聋子，聋的还很厉害呢！甲：不仅是聋子，还是瘸子呢！乙：那你怎么知道他是个瘸子？甲：正当他坐在那里发号施令，一位武官进来，慌慌张张地：“报告国务卿，不得了啦！苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫给总统的信上说，我们的军舰，只能作火箭打靶的目标……”乙：怎么样？甲：杜勒斯吓坏啦，他急得两手按住桌子，想站起来，上身摇晃了两摇晃站不起来。他自己才想到自己的一条腿没了。又叹了口气坐下来。乙：当真是个瘸子啊！甲：这是在朝鲜被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军打折了的。乙：喝，这不是个特级残废吗？甲：不仅是特级残废，看样子活不长久了。乙：怎么样啊？甲：精神失常。乙：有什么表现？甲：我发现他有特殊的嗜好。乙：玩哈吧狗儿？甲：不是。乙：玩古董玉器？甲：不是。他玩的玩意儿从来没有人玩过。乙：究竟是什么？甲：是绞杀人的绳索。乙：这东西还有人玩？拿绞索当跳绳？甲：不是，那还不奇怪呢！乙：拿绞索当裤腰带？甲：太平常了，再想想。乙：我实在想不透。甲：他拿绞索套在脖子上玩。乙：那怎么好玩！甲：各人爱么！你管得着？乙：那可不是玩的，一不小心就有性命之忧。甲：花样多着呢？他不但把绞索套在脖子上，还找人牵着绞索的那一头。乙：这很危险呀！甲：不但危险，已经肯定活不下去。乙：怎么啦：甲：他一定会自己勒死！乙：你给他断定了。甲：不是我，生他的垄断资本家的爹娘早就给他断定了，所以起了个名字叫“都勒死”，早早晚晚都得把自己勒死。
