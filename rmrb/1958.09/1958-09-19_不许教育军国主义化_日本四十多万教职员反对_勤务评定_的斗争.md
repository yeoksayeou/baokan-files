    No Militarization of Education Allowed
    ——The Struggle of Over 400,000 Japanese Teachers Against "Performance Evaluation"
    Lan Hai
    The Kishi Nobusuke government, following the United States and intensifying its involvement in the U.S. atomic strategy system, is pushing forward its policy of reviving militarism at all costs. The militarization of education is an important part of this. "Performance evaluation" is an important means of paving the way for the militarization of education. In order to implement the "performance evaluation" system throughout Japan, the Kishi Nobusuke government is carrying out a major suppression of the over 400,000 Japanese teachers who oppose this measure. With the support of the broad masses of the people, Japanese teachers are also waging a heroic struggle to safeguard democratic education.

    The militarization of Japanese education was arranged as early as 1953 when Yoshida's government's Minister of Finance, Hayato Ikeda, visited the United States to discuss the Common Security Act with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson. The memorandum signed at the time stated: "Participants in the meeting unanimously agreed that promoting a sense of responsibility for defense among the Japanese people is extremely important. It is the primary responsibility of the Japanese government to promote patriotism and the growth of a spontaneous spirit of self-defense in Japan through education and propaganda." The "patriotism" mentioned here obviously refers to the revival of the Japanese militarist spirit. However, the broad masses of Japanese teachers, who awakened rapidly after the war, shouted the slogan "No more sending students to the battlefield." United within the strong organization of the Japan Teachers' Union, they have cultivated and developed peace and democratic education in the struggle against the "loyalty to the emperor and love for the country" education of the Tenno system, which drives the people to engage in wars of aggression, and against the revival of militarism. This has become a major obstacle to the implementation of the policy of reviving militarism by U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionary government.

    In 1954, the Japanese government, disregarding the opposition of the broad masses of the people and 500,000 teachers, forcibly promulgated two education bills, prohibiting teachers from engaging in all democratic activities under the pretext of "maintaining the political neutrality of education." In the classroom, if a student asked, "Isn't the Self-Defense Forces a violation of the Japanese Constitution?" and the teacher answered, "Yes," this would be labeled as a violation of "educational neutrality" and would be subject to punishment.

    In 1956, the Japanese government also implemented the "New Education Committee Law," changing the previously publicly elected education committees of prefectures, cities, towns, and villages to an appointment system, restoring the old practice of bureaucratic control of education before the war. In the same year, the Japanese government, disregarding the opposition of all teachers in Ehime Prefecture, forcibly implemented the "performance evaluation" system.

    The "performance evaluation" system is a system by which the Japanese government "assesses" Japanese teachers in order to control their political ideology. According to this system, the principal has the right to evaluate teachers, dividing them into five grades, ABCDE, and secretly reporting them to the education committee. The education committee then decides on teachers' salary increases, transfers, resignations, etc., based on this evaluation. The aim is to force progressive teachers to submit, divide their unity, and remove the backbone of the Teachers' Union by means of withholding salary increases, banishing them to remote areas, and so on.

    Last December, the Japan Teachers' Union held a special convention and issued an emergency declaration, calling on teachers across the country to prepare for struggle to smash the Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to implement the "performance evaluation" system nationwide in order to defend democratic education. Teachers, who were deprived of the right to strike by the Local Public Service Act, adopted a form of struggle involving taking leave together, demonstrating their solidarity. This April in Tokyo, May in Fukuoka, and June in Wakayama, teachers took leave together to carry out their struggle. In addition, in other parts of Japan, they also adopted methods such as leaving work early together, holding rallies, and collectively petitioning local education committees. On August 15th and 16th, more than 50,000 teachers, workers, students, youth, and parents in Wakayama held a "Rally against Performance Evaluation and in Support of Democratic Education," which was attacked by the police and right-wing groups, even escalating into bloody clashes.

    The Kishi Nobusuke government responded to the teachers' struggle against "performance evaluation" with more and more suppression. In mid-August, fifty-one teachers had already been arrested in Wakayama, and more than one hundred schools and teachers' residences were searched. In Tokyo, seventy-seven places were also searched, and twenty-seven people, including Chairman Kobayashi of the Teachers' Union, were arrested (later released due to mass protests), and more than 30,000 teachers were suspended or warned. In Fukuoka, fifty-two teachers were arrested; in Kyoto, ninety places were searched. It was not just the police who threatened the schools. In many cities, towns, and villages, right-wing groups such as the Greater Japan Production Party and the Kyoyu League, as well as local bosses belonging to the Liberal Democratic Party branch, often barged into the teachers' room wielding wooden swords to threaten teachers, or carried buckets of manure into the teachers' gatherings, scattering manure. In addition, they distributed leaflets under the names of bogus organizations such as "Educational Parents' Councils" to threaten and intimidate teachers.

    While using violence to suppress, the Kishi Nobusuke government also tried to buy off principals and deans to make them oppose ordinary teachers and become loyal servants of the government. To this end, recently, the Kishi Nobusuke government implemented the "Management Position Allowance Law," paying principals and deans several thousand yen in allowances each month; at the same time, it announced that it would allocate a budget of 100 million yen from next year to send 100 principals to the United States each year to study school management experience.

    Principled principals and teachers joined the struggle. For example, six hundred out of 650 principals in Kochi Prefecture joined the Japan Teachers' Union and fought as members of the union. The Hokkaido Elementary and Middle School Principals' Conference also unanimously passed a resolution against the "performance evaluation" system. Four hundred and fifty principals in Aomori Prefecture united and stated that principals have no obligation to implement the "performance evaluation" system.

    Even within local education committees, there are many who oppose the government's forced implementation of the "performance evaluation" system. Twenty-seven local education committees in Hokkaido issued statements opposing the implementation of the "performance evaluation" system or postponing its implementation. Some education committees in Kochi, Akita, Nagano, Mie, and Nagasaki prefectures also expressed opposition to the implementation of the "performance evaluation" system.

    Disregarding all this opposition, the Kishi Nobusuke government forcibly ordered all parts of the country to submit performance evaluation reports within a three-month period from September to November. In response to this measure by the government, on September 15th, the Japan Teachers' Union mobilized more than 439,000 teachers across the country to hold rallies against the "performance evaluation" system in 2,500 locations, conducting a joint struggle. This feat by teachers across Japan has pushed the struggle against the militarization of education to a new climax.

    Millions of workers united around the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan fully support the Japan Teachers' Union and are fighting alongside it. Many democratic groups in Japan also support the struggle of the Japan Teachers' Union.

    Students are completely on the side of the teachers. In order to cooperate with the teachers' struggle, middle school students in Wakayama held a general strike. High school students in Tokyo formed the "Action Committee Against Performance Evaluation" and held demonstrations to support the teachers' struggle. On September 15th, approximately 200,000 students from fifty-three universities in Japan participated in the joint struggle of teachers against the "performance evaluation" system in fifty-two cities.

    The students' parents also took action. They either collectively petitioned the education committee, demanding that the "performance evaluation" system be stopped, or collected signatures in front of the station from passers-by demanding the revocation of teacher punishments. The long novel "The Human Wall" written by writer Tatsuzo Ishikawa, which was serialized in the "Asahi Shimbun" for more than a year, vividly reflects the teachers' struggle. This novel has been welcomed by millions of readers. Mothers across the country have begun to organize "'Human Wall' reading groups."

    From the Socialist Party and the Communist Party onwards, all progressive forces are on the side of the teachers. The struggle against the "performance evaluation" system has become a major issue in the struggle between progressive and reactionary forces.

    The militarization of education, nuclear armament, the enactment of secrecy laws, the implementation of a single-seat constituency system, the revision of the constitution, and the implementation of conscription - this is a series of links in the entire chain of the Kishi Nobusuke government's revival of militarism. But the road to the revival of militarism will not work, because the Japanese people oppose taking this road. If Kishi Nobusuke insists on going down this road, he can only run into a brick wall.

    不许教育军国主义化
    ——日本四十多万教职员反对“勤务评定”的斗争
    蓝海
    追随美国、加紧卷入美国原子战略体系的岸信介政府，正在不顾一切地推行它的复活军国主义的政策。教育的军国主义化，是其中重要的一环。“勤务评定”又是为教育军国主义化铺平道路的重要手段。为了在日本全国实行“勤务评定”制度，岸信介政府正在对反对这种措施的四十多万日本教职员进行着大镇压。日本教职员也在广大人民的支持下，为维护民主教育进行着英勇斗争。
    日本教育的军国主义化，早在1953年吉田政府的大藏相池田勇人访美商谈共同安全法案时，即同美国助理国务卿罗伯逊商定了。当时签定的备忘录上写道：“参加会谈者一致认为：促进日本国民对于防卫的责任感极关重要。通过教育和宣传，在日本促进爱国心和对于自卫的自发精神的增长，是日本政府的首要责任”。这里所说的“爱国心”，显然是指日本军国主义精神的复活。但是，战后急速觉醒起来的日本广大教师，却喊出了“不再把学生送上战场”的口号。他们团结在日本教职员工会这个坚强的组织之内，在反对驱使人民进行侵略战争的“忠君爱国”的天皇制教育、反对复活军国主义的斗争中，培植了和发展了和平和民主的教育。这对于美帝国主义和日本反动政府推行复活军国主义政策，就成了很大障碍。
    1954年，日本政府不顾广大人民和五十万教职员工的反对，强行颁布两项教育法案，在“保持教育在政治上中立”的借口下，禁止教师从事一切民主活动。在教室里，学生问道：“自卫队不是违反日本宪法的吗？”教师答道：“是的”。这也会被扣上违反“教育中立”的罪名，而要受到处分。
    1956年，日本政府又实行了“新教育委员会法”，把以前都道府县市町村的教育委员会的公选制，改为任命制，恢复了战前由官僚机构控制教育的老作法。同一年，日本政府在爱媛县不顾全县教师的反对，强制实行了“勤务评定”制度。
    “勤务评定”制度是日本政府为了控制日本教职员的政治思想而对他们进行“考核”的一种制度。根据这一制度，校长有权对教师进行评定，分为ABCDE五级，秘密呈报教育委员会。教育委员会则根据这项评定，决定教师加薪、调动、退职等等。其目的是要用停止加薪、放逐到穷乡僻地等等办法，迫使进步教师屈服，分化他们的团结，拔除教职员工会的骨干。
    去年12月，日本教职员工会召开临时大会，发表紧急宣言，呼吁全国教师准备斗争，粉碎岸信介政府在全国实行“勤务评定”制度的企图，以保卫民主教育。由于地方公务员法而被剥夺了罢教权利的教师们，采取了一齐请假的斗争方式，显示了他们的团结力量。今年4月在东京，5月在福冈，6月在和歌山，教师们都采取了一齐请假的办法进行了斗争。此外，在日本其他各地，也采取了一齐早退、举行集会、向地方教育委员会集体请愿等等办法进行了斗争。8月15、16两日，和歌山的五万多名教师、工人、学生、青年和学生家长等举行“反对勤务评定、拥护民主教育”大会，受到警察和右翼团体的袭击，甚至演成了流血冲突。
    对于教师们反对“勤务评定”的斗争，岸信介政府镇压继以镇压。8月中，在和歌山已经逮捕了五十一名教师，搜查了一百数十所学校和教师住宅。在东京，也有七十七个地方受到搜查，教职员工会小林委员长等二十七名遭到逮捕（后来由于群众抗议已获释放），并有三万多名教师受到停职或警告处分。在福冈，有五十二名教师被捕；在京都，有九十个地方受到搜查。威胁学校的不仅仅是警察。在许多市町村镇，大日本生产党、乡友联盟等右翼团体以及属于自由民主党支部的地方上的头子，常常挥舞木刀闯进教员室威胁教师，或是把粪桶抬进教师集会的地方，乱撒粪尿。此外，他们还用“教育父母会议”之类架空团体的名义散发传单，对教师进行威胁恫吓。
    岸信介政府一面使用暴力进行镇压，一面想收买校长和教务长，使他们同一般教师对立，成为政府的忠实奴仆。为此，最近，岸信介政府实行了“管理职务津贴法”，每月发给校长和教务长数千日元津贴；同时，又宣布从来年起拨出一亿日元的预算，每年派遣一百名校长赴美考察学校管理的经验。
    有气节的校长和教师们一道参加了斗争。例如，高知县的六百五十名校长当中有六百人参加了日本教职员工会，作为工会的会员进行了斗争。北海道中小学校长会议，也一致通过了反对“勤务评定”制度的决议。青森县的四百五十名校长团结一致，表示校长没有义务一定要实行“勤务评定”制度。
    甚至在地方教育委员会中，反对政府强制实行“勤务评定”制度的也大有人在。北海道的二十七个地方教育委员会发表了反对实行“勤务评定”制度或延期实行“勤务评定”制度的声明。高知、秋田、长野、三重、长崎各县的一部分教育委员会，也表示反对实行“勤务评定”制度。
    岸信介政府不顾这一切反对，强制勒令全国各地在9月至11月的三个月期限内全部提出勤务评定书。日本教职员工会针对政府的这一措施，在9月15日发动全国四十三万九千多教师分别在二千五百个地方举行反对“勤务评定”制度的大会，进行联合斗争。日本全国教职员的这个壮举，已把反对教育军国主义化的斗争推入了一个新的高潮。
    团结在日本工会总评议会周围的数百万工人，完全支持日本教职员工会，并同它一道进行斗争。日本许多民主团体也都支持日本教职员工会的斗争。
    学生们完全站在教师这一边。和歌山的中学生为了配合教师们的斗争，举行了总罢课。东京的高中学生们组成了“反对勤务评定行动委员会”，并曾举行游行示威，支持教师们的斗争。9月15日，日本五十三个大学的大约二十万名学生，分别在五十二个城市参加了教职员反对“勤务评定”制度的联合斗争。
    学生的家长也行动起来了。他们或者集体去教育委员会请愿，要求停止实行“勤务评定”制度，或是在车站前向过往的行人征集要求撤销教师处分的签名。在“朝日新闻”上连载一年以上的作家石川达三写的长篇小说“人墙”，生动地反映了教师们的斗争。这部小说受到数百万读者的欢迎。全国各地的母亲们，开始组织“‘人墙’读书会”。
    从社会党、共产党开始，各种进步力量都站在教师这一边。反对“勤务评定”制度的斗争，已成为进步势力和反动势力斗争的一大课题。
    教育的军国主义化，进行核武装，制定保密法，实行小选举区制，修改宪法和实行义务兵役制，——这就是岸信介政府复活军国主义的整个链条中的一连串环节。但是复活军国主义的道路将是走不通的，因为日本人民反对走这条道路。岸信介执意要走下去，那就只能碰得头破血流。
