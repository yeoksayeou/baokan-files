Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Ministry of Food issued instructions on conscientiously carrying out the unified purchase of autumn oil crops. The instructions pointed out: Doing a good job in the unified purchase of autumn oil crops is not only to ensure the normal supply of edible oil to urban and rural residents and complete the necessary export tasks, but more importantly, to further promote the development of industrial and agricultural production through the purchase work.

The instructions said: Although this year's increase in oil crop production is relatively large, it is still far from meeting the needs of the people, and the contradiction between production and consumption has not been fundamentally resolved. All localities must formulate unified purchase and sales methods that encourage increased production based on the principle of "more production, more consumption; less production, less consumption," and adopt the policy of quick collection and full collection to quickly collect all the oil crops that should be purchased. In high-yield areas, more should be collected appropriately without affecting the enthusiasm of farmers for increasing production, in order to replenish inventories. Because the quantity of autumn oil crop purchases is large, the time is concentrated, and the rural labor force is extremely strained, the purchase methods must pay attention to saving manpower, supporting production, and facilitating the masses. All localities should organize forces and systematically strengthen cooperation with agricultural cooperatives, starting with assisting agricultural cooperatives in arranging labor, meticulously plowing, harvesting, and picking, turning, drying, sorting, grading, stacking, and clearing pre-purchases, to further improve the purchase work. In order to cooperate with the arrangement of rural labor, methods such as day and night purchases, mobile purchases, and rush organization of warehousing can also be adopted to facilitate the sale of agricultural cooperatives and support agricultural production.

The instructions said: With the establishment of industries in every township and cooperative, it is estimated that rural native oil presses will be restored and developed to some extent after this autumn. All localities should continue to implement the policy that, in addition to supplying oil crops for export, essential urban edible oil, and processing raw materials, agricultural cooperatives should be organized to self-press oil wherever processing conditions permit, and oil products should be purchased directly. In areas without processing conditions, the method of state-provided processing or collection of materials and return of oil cakes can be adopted.

The instructions said: The production of sunflower seeds and castor seeds has developed rapidly this year, which provides favorable conditions for solving the shortage of oil sources, supporting production, and meeting export, industrial, and market needs. These scattered sunflower seeds and castor seeds must be purchased responsibly and conscientiously, and they must be valued in the same way as bulk oil crops, resolutely overcoming the idea of disliking small quantities and fearing trouble. The demand for industrial oils such as tung oil, wood oil, and cypress oil has increased rapidly since the Great Leap Forward, and the policy of unified purchase should continue to be implemented to vigorously organize purchases.

The instructions said: To do the above work well, we must first put politics in command and educate cadres in the spirit of the General Line to establish the view of serving production and serving the masses. Rely on the Party committees, cooperate with all parties under the unified leadership of the Party committees, and do a good job in various preparations. The unified purchase of grain and oil must be closely integrated, using forces in a unified way, and jointly organizing warehousing.

    粮食部发布秋季油料统购工作指示
    油料要快收收足
    新华社17日讯　粮食部发布关于认真做好秋季油料统购工作的指示。指示指出：做好秋季油料统购工作，不仅是为了保证城乡人民正常的食油供应和完成必要的出口任务，更重要的是通过收购工作，进一步发挥对工农业生产的促进作用。
    指示说：今年的油料增产幅度虽然较大，但距离人民的需要还是很远，生产和消费的矛盾还没有从根本上获得解决。各地必须根据“多增产多吃，少增产少吃”的原则，因地制宜制定鼓励增产的统购统销办法，采取快收、收足的方针，迅速地把应该收购的油料都收购起来。丰产地区在不影响农民增产积极性的前提下，应适当的多收一些，以充实库存。由于秋季油料收购数量大、时间集中、农村劳动力又异常紧张，收购方法就必须注意节约民力、支持生产、便利群众。各地要组织力量，有计划地从协助农业社做好劳动力的安排、细刨细收细采、翻晒整理、分级、堆存、清理预购等工作入手，加强与农业社的协作，进一步搞好收购工作。为了配合农村劳动力的安排，还可采取日夜收购、巡回收购和突击组织入库等方式，以便利农业社的交售，支持农业生产。
    指示说：在乡乡社社办工业的情况下，估计今年秋后农村土榨油坊将有所恢复和发展。各地应继续贯彻除供应出口与城市必需食油和加工原料收购油料外，在有加工条件的地区，都要尽可能组织农业社自榨，直接收购油品。没有加工条件的地区，可以采取国家代加工或收料退饼的方式。
    指示说：葵花籽与蓖麻籽的生产今年发展很快，这对解决油源不足、支持生产，满足出口、工业和市场需要，提供了有利条件。要认真负责地收购这些分散生产的葵花籽和蓖麻籽，必须和大宗油料一样重视，坚决克服嫌零星怕麻烦的思想。桐油、木油、柏油等工业用油，在大跃进以后需要量增加很快，应继续贯彻统一收购的政策，大力组织收购。
    指示说：做好以上工作，必须首先是政治挂帅，以总路线的精神教育干部树立为生产服务为群众服务的观点。依靠党委，在党委统一领导下同各方面协作，做好各项准备工作。粮油统购必须密切结合，统一使用力量，共同组织入库。
