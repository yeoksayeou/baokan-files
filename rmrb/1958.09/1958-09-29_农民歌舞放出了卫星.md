Farmers' Song and Dance Release a Satellite
Liu Zhiming

As the people of the whole country are creating miracles on all fronts with unparalleled vigor to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the National Day, I am very happy to see the performance of the Baihua Farmers' Song and Dance Troupe of Tangfang People's Commune in Fengrun County, Hebei Province, in Beijing.

The farmers of the Mao Zedong era have not only continuously launched satellites on the agricultural front, but also continuously demonstrated their excellent talents on the cultural front. The establishment of the People's Commune has promoted the rapid development of production, and further reflected the urgent demands of the masses for cultural life. The Baihua Farmers' Song and Dance Troupe was born on the same day as their commune. From the very beginning, the farmers' song and dance troupe made it clear that it was not only a production team but also a performance team, and that the performance should serve politics and production. Therefore, less than a month after its establishment, it rehearsed the four-act song and dance "Flowers Blossom in the People's Commune," which reflected the new atmosphere in the countryside after the establishment of the People's Commune. This is a very ambitious and folk-flavored song and dance program. It truly and vividly depicts the great leap forward in the countryside and the soaring enthusiasm of the farmers. At the beginning, the audience saw the magnificent scene of the commune's morning, with people one after another, row after row, line after line, walking out of the canteen energetically to go to work; the second scene was celebrating the harvest, the girls' fan dance symbolizing the wheat waves swaying in the wind was so full of vitality, and the joyous mood of the masses celebrating the harvest was even more exciting. The final scene depicts the grand chorus at the end of the People's Commune Grand Paradise, which is overwhelming and demonstrates the enormous power of the people. I think this is a rare song and dance program that truly reflects the life of the countryside during the Great Leap Forward.

The establishment of the Baihua Farmers' Song and Dance Troupe and the favorable comments on the performances prove the necessity of combining professional and amateur literary and art workers. Cadres from the Central Song and Dance Troupe in Beijing were sent to the Tangfang People's Commune to participate in labor, humbly learn from the masses, and create together with the literary and art enthusiasts in the commune. This practice is completely correct. It also shows that only through labor training and truly understanding the thoughts and feelings of the working people can literary and art workers create literary and art works that are popular with the masses and commensurate with the lives of the heroic people of our great era.

    农民歌舞放出了卫星
    刘芝明
    当全国人民正以无比干劲，在各个战线上创造奇迹向国庆九周年献礼的前夕，我看了河北丰润县唐坊人民公社百花农民歌舞团来北京的演出，感到非常高兴。
    毛泽东时代的农民不仅在农业战线上连续放射了卫星，在文化战线上也不断地显示出自己优异的才能。人民公社的建立促进了生产的飞跃发展，也进一步反映了群众在文化生活上的迫切要求，百花农民歌舞团就是和他们的公社同一天诞生的。这个农民歌舞团从建立的时候起，便明确了自己既是一个生产队，又是一个演出队，演出要为政治、为生产服务的方针，所以建立不到一个月便排练出反映人民公社建立后农村新气象的四场大歌舞“人民公社鲜花开”。这是一个很有气魄而又富有民间色彩的歌舞节目，它真实而又生动地描绘了农村大跃进，农民干劲冲天的面貌。一开场观众便看到公社的早晨，人们一个接一个，一排排一行行，精力充沛地从食堂走出来上工去的雄壮场面；第二场是庆丰收，姑娘们象征麦浪迎风飘荡的扇舞是那么富有生命力，群众庆贺丰收的欢腾情绪，更是令人振奋。最后一场描写人民公社大乐园结尾时的大合唱声势浩大，表现了人民排山倒海的巨大力量。我认为这是目前难得的，真实地反映了大跃进中农村生活面貌的歌舞节目。
    百花农民歌舞团的成立和演出的获得好评，证明了专业文艺工作者和业余文艺工作者结合的必要。北京中央歌舞团的干部下放到唐坊人民公社参加劳动，虚心向群众学习，和社里的文艺爱好者一起进行创作。这种作法是完全正确的。这也说明了文艺工作者只有在劳动锻炼中，真正体会了劳动人民的思想感情，才能创作出群众喜闻乐见，和我们这个伟大时代英雄人民生活风貌相称的文艺作品。
