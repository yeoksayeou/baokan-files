Zhejiang's Million Cadres Converge on the Fields

(Our newspaper, Hangzhou, September 5th dispatch) More than one million cadres of six levels in Zhejiang Province have converged on the fields, carrying out large-scale rectification in the fields, focusing on field management, and fiercely attacking the three barriers (topdressing, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and prevention of lodging), achieving great results with unstoppable momentum.

Currently, Li Fengping, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee, and Standing Committee member Lu Zhixian, among others, are leading large numbers of provincial-level government cadres to the seven special districts and suburban areas of Hangzhou. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 1,003,000 cadres of six levels—provincial, district, county, area, township, and commune—across the province have gone deep into the fields, where they eat, live, and labor alongside the commune members. Many places have set up thatched sheds in the fields. The district committee secretaries of Sandun, Linping, Tangqi and other districts in the suburbs of Hangzhou all live in thatched sheds next to the experimental fields, working alongside the masses. Township and commune cadres in Tangnan Township even carry waterwheels and pest control agents with them to the fields. They draw water and control pests during the day, and use lights to attract moths at night, until the pests and drought are eliminated, then they move to another location and build another shed. Jinyun County in Jinhua Special District put forward the resounding slogan: "Campments are set up in every field, thatched sheds are built in every plot, fields have field leaders, plots have plot leaders, fields have commanders, cooking is done far away, meals are delivered nearby, and we will not retreat until we break through the three barriers." In addition to organizing county, district, township, and commune cadres to go deep into the fields, this special district also implemented a system where cadres remaining in government offices work half a day and labor half a day.

After the cadres went deep into the fields, they closely integrated with production and universally carried out field rectification. The method of field rectification is to conduct field inspections, seize the contradictions between the advanced and the backward, launch on-the-spot criticism and debates, study measures to address the problems existing in production, and solve them immediately. On August 16th, when five levels of cadres in Ningbo Special District inspected the field management of late rice in Dongguan, Shangyu County, they discovered two different situations regarding drought resistance. In Gangkou Commune of this town, due to the leadership of the commune cadres, a professional water-drawing team was organized, and more than 300 mu of fields had been irrigated, with rice seedlings growing lush and green. The neighboring Majiaqiao Commune had better conditions than Gangkou Commune, with the field surrounded by rivers on three sides and abundant water. Cadres from the county agricultural bureau also lived in this commune, but due to insufficient drought resistance efforts, some fields were cut off from water, the cracks in the fields were wider than fingers, and the seedlings had withered. The comrades participating in the field inspection immediately wrote a big-character poster criticizing the cadres there. The big-character poster said: "Surrounded by rivers on three sides with abundant water, why is there water but no drought resistance? The district committee and town committee are nearby, meeting day and night. If this situation is not changed, how can we guarantee a large increase in production!"

That afternoon, the CPC Dongguan District Committee held an on-site meeting in Majiaqiao Commune, which was also attended by Zhou Xiaoru, Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, and Li Fuxiang, Secretary of the Shangyu County Committee. The meeting was held in the field, with participants observing and discussing. At the meeting, many people criticized Majiaqiao Commune for its lack of vigor and its failure to effectively overcome the three barriers in drought resistance, and the relevant comrades also conducted self-criticism. This meeting greatly improved the cadres' awareness of drought resistance and breaking through the three barriers. After the meeting, Majiaqiao Commune mobilized more than 30 waterwheels and more than 350 people to work tirelessly overnight, resisting drought and drawing water. In this way, more than 110 mu of drought-stricken late rice fields were irrigated by the next morning. In Ninghai County, 72 mu of late rice in Chengguan Town suffered from rice blast, which had never been discovered in the past due to the cadres' lack of in-depth work. After the discovery this time, prevention and control measures were immediately taken. During the field rectification, the masses raised more than 510,000 suggestions and posted 85,900 big-character posters, with both praise and criticism, which greatly promoted the transformation of the cadres' work style and promoted the current production.

Rectification generates enthusiasm. With a million cadres going down to the fields, production is leaping forward without limit. During this period, the entire province achieved great results in drought resistance to protect autumn harvests, accumulating and applying fertilizer, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. Zhoushan Special District organized 100,000 laborers to dig wells and carry water, relieving the drought situation for more than 50,000 mu of severely drought-stricken land. Ningbo, Jinhua, Jiande and other special districts currently have more than 2 million people going deep into the fields day and night to resist drought. The fertilizer accumulation movement has initially formed a climax throughout the province. Jiaxing Special District has accumulated an average of more than 20,000 dan of decomposed fertilizer per mu. Activities to prevent and control diseases and insect pests have also been fully launched. According to statistics from five special districts—Jiaxing, Jinhua, Jiande, Taizhou, and Zhoushan—and Yueqing, Pingyang, Wencheng, Qingtian, and Yongjia in Wenzhou Special District, and Zhuji, Xinchang, and Yinxian in Ningbo Special District, by August 17th, a total of more than 6.8 million mu had been treated with pesticides, accounting for 92.8% of the area that should be treated. A movement to produce indigenous pesticides has also been launched throughout the province. By August 18th, a total of 56,800 indigenous pesticide plants had been established, and more than 85 million jin of indigenous pesticides had been produced. The broad masses of farmers are making persistent efforts to launch a general attack on the disease and pest barrier.

Currently, the first battle of field management in the province has achieved a great victory. At the end of August, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee held another telephone conference to deploy the work of the second battle. Responsible comrades from local district and county committees attended the conference. At the telephone conference, Comrade Lin Hujia, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Committee, made important instructions. He said: "Checking production in the fields is actually checking work, checking the ideological style of cadres. To change backward seedlings, we must start by changing the ideological style of cadres. If this root cannot be dug up, the work situation cannot be changed. For this reason, leading cadres at all levels should quickly conduct rectification on the problems existing in current field management and the problems existing in the summer harvest pre-distribution work, discussing the real and the virtual."

    田畈扎营　田头整风　参加劳动　全面跃进
　　浙江百万干部会师田间
    本报杭州5日电　浙江省六级干部百余万人会师田间，开展田头大整风，大抓田间管理，猛攻三关（追肥、防治病虫害和防止倒伏），势如破竹，取得了巨大成绩。
    目前，中共浙江省委书记处书记李丰平、常委吕志先等，都分别带领大批省级机关干部到达全省七个专区和杭州市郊区。据不完全统计，全省共有省、地、县、区、乡、社六级干部一百万零三千人深入田间，他们都和社员同吃、同住、同劳动。许多地方都已在田间搭起了草棚。杭州市郊区三墩、临平、塘栖等区区委书记，都住在试验田旁的草棚里，和群众一同劳动。塘南乡的乡、社干部，还随身带着水车、治虫药剂等在田间落户。他们白天车水、治虫，晚上点灯诱蛾，直到虫、旱消灭，再转移地点，另外搭棚。金华专区的缙云县，提出了“畈畈扎营盘，片片搭草棚，田有田长，片有片长，畈有指挥，远地建灶，近地送饭，不破三关不收兵”的响亮口号。这个专区除组织县、区、乡、社干部深入田间外，留在机关的干部，还实行了半天工作、半天劳动的办法。
    干部深入田间以后，紧密结合生产，普遍进行了田头整风。田头整风的方式，是通过田间检查，抓住先进与落后的对立面，就地展开鸣放辩论，针对生产上存在的问题，研究措施，立即解决。8月16日，宁波专区五级干部在上虞县东关讫检查晚稻的田间管理时，在抗旱问题上，发现了两种不同情况。这个镇的港口社由于社干部带头，组织了专业车水小组，使三百多亩田都已灌上了水，稻苗长得一片葱绿。邻近的马家桥社，条件比港口社好，田的三面环河，河水盈盈，县农业局的干部也住在这个社里，但由于抗旱不力，使得部分田里断水，田里的裂缝比指头还宽，禾苗已枯。参加田间检查的同志当即写大字报一张，对这里的干部提出批评。大字报说：“三面环河水盈盈，为何有水不抗旱？区委镇委在旁边，日日夜夜都见面。这种情况不改变，怎能保证大增产！”
    当天下午，中共东关区委就在马家桥社举行现场会议，地委副书记周笑儒、上虞县委书记李福湘也参加了会议。会议在田头召开，一边参观，一边议论。会上，许多人对马家桥社劲头不足、抗旱破三关不力提出批评，有关的同志也进行了自我检查。这次会议，大大提高了干部对于抗旱破三关的自觉性。会后，马家桥社出动了三十多部水车，三百五十多人彻夜不眠，抗旱车水。就这样，一百一十多亩受旱的晚稻田，到第二天上午亩亩都车上了水。宁海县城关镇有七十二亩晚稻发生稻热病，过去由于干部作风不深入，从未发现。这次发现后，立即进行了防治。全县在田头整风中，群众提出了五十一万多条意见，贴出大字报八万五千九百张，既有表扬，又有批评，大大促进了干部作风的转变，推动了当前的生产。
    整风出干劲。百万干部下田，生产跃进无边。这一时期，全省在抗旱保秋、积肥施肥、防治病虫害方面，都取得了很大的成绩。舟山专区共组织了十万劳力挖井、挑水，使五万多亩受旱严重的土地解除了旱情。宁波、金华、建德等专区，目前每天有二百多万人深入田间日夜抗旱。积肥运动已在全省初步形成高潮。嘉兴专区平均每亩已积沤肥两万多担。防治病虫害的活动也已全面展开。据嘉兴、金华、建德、台州、舟山五个专区和温州专区的乐清、平阳、文成、青田、永嘉，宁波专区的诸暨、新昌、鄞县等地的统计，到8月17日止，共用药剂防治六百八十多万亩，占应防治面积的92.8％。全省各地还掀起了大搞土农药的运动。到8月18日，共建立土农药场五万六千八百个，已生产土农药八千五百多万斤。广大农民正在再接再厉，总攻病虫害关。
    目前，全省田间管理的第一个战役已取得巨大胜利。8月底，浙江省委又召开了电话会议，部署第二个战役的工作。会议由各地委、县委的负责同志参加。在电话会议上，省委书记处书记林乎加同志作了重要指示。他说：田头查生产，实际上就是查工，查干部的思想作风。要改变落后苗，必须从改变干部的思想作风着手。挖不到这个根，工作局面是无法改变的。为此，各级领导骨干应该迅速就当前田间管理上存在的问题、夏收预分工作上存在的问题，就实论虚，进行整风。
