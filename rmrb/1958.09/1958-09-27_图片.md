    Left Sea Poem: A farmer from Pi County, his body ascending high mountains with the flying birds; peach and plum trees forming forests, greening a bay. I only wish everyone would diligently cultivate, so that ten thousand flowers bloom all over the white clouds.

    左海诗  邳县农民画身随飞鸟上高山，桃李成林绿一湾，但愿人人勤垦殖，万花开遍白云间。
