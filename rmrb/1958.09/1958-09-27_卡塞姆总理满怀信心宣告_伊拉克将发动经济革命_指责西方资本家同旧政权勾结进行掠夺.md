Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, September 24th: Iraqi Republic Prime Minister Qassem, when meeting with a delegation of Iraqi engineers on the 23rd, said that Iraq would soon "launch a large-scale revolution to develop the economy." He said, "We will strive to control our own resources and organize the means to develop these resources."

Qassem said, "We will industrialize our country to create other sources of wealth to meet the various needs of our country." He said, "If any resource is paralyzed at any time, we will not be helpless."

In his speech, he accused Western capitalists of colluding with the old regime to plunder Iraq. He told the delegation that the government would rely on them to implement new plans. Only when necessary will foreign experts be employed, but their authority is purely advisory.

Speaking of the Algerian issue, Qassem said that Iraq will provide the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria with material and spiritual assistance.

On the 22nd, Qassem also met with journalists from Switzerland, Ireland, and West Germany. In response to questions raised by reporters, Qassem said: We are currently working to unite all indivisible factors of the Iraqi Republic, so as to form a strong force that foreigners cannot penetrate to undermine our unity.

Qassem said that Iraq is conducting full cooperation with Arab countries, especially the United Arab Republic. He said: The people of our region are able to achieve accomplishments that determine our destiny and will not allow foreigners to interfere in our affairs.

He said that the situation in Iraq before the revolution was very serious, the country had been fundamentally ruined, the interests of the people had been largely ignored, the power of foreigners was very strong, and exploitation was very serious. He pointed out that Iraq is rich and has many resources, but in the past they were used unreasonably. He said that we have a wide range of reform plans, and we will use these plans to improve the lives of the people, especially the poor.

    卡塞姆总理满怀信心宣告
    伊拉克将发动经济革命
    指责西方资本家同旧政权勾结进行掠夺
    新华社巴格达24日电  伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆在23日接见伊拉克的一个工程师代表团时说，伊拉克不久“将发动一个大规模的发展经济的革命”。他说：“我们将努力控制我们自己的资源，并且组织开发这些资源的手段”。
    卡塞姆说：“我们将使我们的国家工业化，以创造其它的财源来应付我们国家的各种需要”。他说：“如果任何一种资源在任何一个时候瘫痪的话，我们将不会束手无策”。
    他在谈话中指责西方资本家同旧政权勾结对伊拉克进行掠夺。他对代表团说，政府将依靠他们来实现新的计划。只有在必要时，才任用外国专家，可是他们的权限是纯咨询性的。
    在谈到阿尔及利亚问题时，卡塞姆说，伊拉克将给阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府以物质上和精神上的援助。
    卡塞姆22日还接见了瑞士、爱尔兰和西德记者。卡塞姆在回答记者们提出的问题时说：我们目前正在致力于团结伊拉克共和国不可分割的一切因素，以便使他们形成一种强大的力量，使外国人不能钻进来破坏我们的团结。
    卡塞姆说，伊拉克同阿拉伯各国特别是阿拉伯联合共和国进行完全的合作。他说：我们这个地区的人民，能够获致决定我们的命运的成就，不允许外国人干涉我们的事务。
    他说，伊拉克革命前的情况非常严重，国家已经从根本上被搞坏了，人民的利益在很大程度上被忽视了，外国人的势力非常强大，剥削十分严重。他指出，伊拉克是富庶的，资源很多，但是过去使用得不合理。他说，我们有范围很广的改革计划，我们将凭着这些计划改善人民特别是穷人的生活。
