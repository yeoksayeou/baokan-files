　　The Road of Creation

    In this season of abundant cotton growth, agricultural scientific researchers, students of the agricultural red-and-expert university, and farmers in Gaotang County have found a way to control cotton boll abscission. This is not only great news for the people in cotton-growing areas across the country but also for all the people of the country. The resolution of this historical problem creates unprecedentedly favorable conditions for high-yield and guaranteed harvest of cotton in our country.
    In the past, cotton farmers were resigned to the natural abscission of cotton bolls, feeling powerless to do anything about it. Even many scientists at home and abroad considered a quarter of cotton boll abscission to be reasonable. However, in the newly established rural agricultural science research station and agricultural red-and-expert university, this problem was quickly and basically solved. This fact shows that as long as people's minds are not closed by stale ideas, as long as they are not satisfied with the achievements of the past, as long as they do not become slaves to objective natural laws, but dare to think boldly, conduct independent research, seek and master the laws of the development of objective things, and dare to try to use knowledge of objective laws to serve mankind, and work tirelessly, people can finally achieve their goals.
    The cotton department of the agricultural red-and-expert university in Yinji and Jiangdian townships of Gaotang County, and the township-run agricultural science research station, did not have scholars and experts from the highest research institutions; their scientific knowledge and research experience were limited. These were their difficult conditions. But they also lacked the academic biases and rigid old ideas that scholars and experts often have. From this perspective, it was their advantageous condition. The comrades here gave full play to the advantage of "no preconceptions," vividly applying the teaching method of combining theory with practice in their work, and started researching the problem of cotton boll abscission as soon as the course began. Many of the lecturers in the cotton departments of these two schools were also skilled cotton growers, with over a decade or even decades of rich cotton growing experience. In the past, this experience had never been systematically summarized. This year, they had the opportunity to research and summarize, so they set up classrooms and laboratories in the cotton fields, learning, doing, researching, summarizing, and promoting simultaneously. The specimen textbooks were alive, production was learning, and learning was production. With the encouragement and support of the Party committee and the enlightenment of scientific knowledge from the cadres who were sent to lower levels, they conducted field experiments and observations day and night, and the solution to the problem was finally found.
    These methods have now been promoted throughout Gaotang County. According to Cao Heguang, the director of the cotton department of the Yinji Township Red-and-Expert Agricultural University, if each cotton plant loses two bolls during a rain, and there are 4,500 plants per mu, then each boll abscission event would reduce production by more than 100 jin of seed cotton per mu. This shows how significant it is to preserve cotton bolls for increasing cotton production.
    Many people, when faced with this situation, always have a question: Why are some people able to break superstitions, think and create boldly, while others are always bound by preconceptions and dogmas, unable to free themselves, so that they have no achievements and cannot move forward? Regarding this question, we believe that it is necessary to conduct a class analysis, just as with other issues (regardless of whether some people are willing to do so). Everyone knows that practice is the source of knowledge and the standard of truth. However, the exploiting classes and their scholars (perhaps these scholars are not consciously standing on the side of the exploiters) are always far removed from the production practice of the masses. In this way, the source of their wisdom is also blocked. They have no desire to pursue progress, no revolutionary enthusiasm, and are often satisfied and intoxicated with the little achievements they have already made. Of course, they cannot talk about solving new problems and making new contributions to society. The working class and the laboring masses are the opposite: the content of their lives is labor and production, is to labor better and produce more. This is a need of life and also a source of happiness. This is for themselves and for all mankind. Their greatest joy is to make greater progress and more gains in the practice of labor and production. And practice itself often suggests research topics and clues to them, and points out the direction of advancement. In the past, due to the limitations of social conditions, they were unable to unleash their creative talents. Now that society is liberated, their creative talents have also been unleashed. This talent will never dry up, because practice is endless.
    All those who hope to walk ahead of the times and do not want to lag behind, go deep into the production practice of the masses. This is the only way.

　　创造的路

    正当棉花盛长的季节，高唐县农业科学研究人员、农业红专大学学员和农民们找到了控制棉铃脱落的办法，这不仅对全国棉区人民是一大喜讯，对全国所有人民也是一大喜讯。这个历史上的难题的解决，为我国棉花丰产保收创造了空前有利的条件。
    过去棉农对棉铃的脱落是听其自然，无能为力的。连中外许多科学家也认为棉铃脱落四分之一是合理的。但是，在刚刚成立不久的乡村农业科学研究站和农业红专大学里，这个难题竟很快地基本上得到解决。这个事实说明，只要人们的思想不被陈腐的观念所闭塞，不满足于以往人们所达到的成就，不做客观自然规律的奴隶，而敢于大胆思考，独立研究，寻求和掌握客观事物的发展规律，敢于尝试利用客观规律的知识来为人类服务，并且努力不懈，人们就能够最后达到自己的目的。
    高唐县尹集、姜店两个乡的农业红专大学的棉花系和乡办的农业科学研究站，并没有来自最高研究机关的学者和专家，他们的科学知识和研究的经验都有限。这是他们的困难条件。但是他们也没有学者和专家们所经常有的那些学说上的成见和死硬的陈旧观念。从这方面看，又是他们的有利条件。这里的同志们充分地发挥了“没有成见”这种优点，在工作中生动地运用了理论和实践相结合的教学方法，一开课就着手研究棉花脱铃问题。这两个学校棉花系的讲师们，有好多人又是植棉能手，他们有着十多年乃至数十年丰富的植棉经验。过去从来没有系统地总结过，今年有了研究和总结的机会，他们就把课堂、试验室设在棉田里，边学，边做，边研究，边总结，边推广。标本教材是活的，生产就是学习，学习也就是生产。加上党委的鼓励、支持和下放干部科学知识的启发，他们日日夜夜地实地试验观察，解决问题的办法就终于找出来了。
    这些办法现在已经在高唐全县范围内得到推广。根据尹集乡红专农业大学棉花系主任曹和光计算，下一次雨以每棵棉花脱落两个铃计，每亩按四千五百株计，一亩地一次脱铃就要减产一百多斤籽棉。这说明保住棉铃对棉花增产有多么巨大的意义。
    有许多人在碰到这种情况的时候，总是发生一个疑问：为什么有一些人能够打破迷信，大胆思想和创造，而有一些人却总是被成见和教条束缚着，不能解脱，以至自己没有成就，不能前进呢？对于这问题，我们认为也需要像对待别的问题一样，进行阶级的分析（不管有些人是否愿意）。谁都知道：实践是认识的源泉，也是真理的标准。而剥削阶级和它的学者们（也许这些学者并非自觉地站在剥削者一边）却总是远远地脱离了人民群众的生产实践的。这样，他们的智慧的源泉也就堵塞了。他们没有追求进步的愿望，没有革命的热情，经常满足和陶醉于既得的一点点成就，当然也就谈不上解决新的问题，为社会作出新的贡献。工人阶级和劳动群众与此相反：他们的生活内容就是劳动和生产，就是劳动得更好，生产得更多。这是生活的需要，也是幸福的源泉。这是为了他们自身，也是为了整个人类。他们的最大快乐，就是在劳动和生产的实践中取得更大的进展和更多的收获。而实践本身也就经常向他们提示研究的题目和线索，提示前进的方向。过去他们由于社会条件的限制，没有发挥出创造的才能。而今社会解放了，他们的创造才能也就发挥出来了。这种才能是永远不会枯竭的，因为实践是无穷无尽的。
    一切希望走在时代前面而不愿意落伍的人，深入到群众的生产实践中去吧。这是唯一的道路。
