Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 21st: People from all walks of life in Chongqing gathered today, expressing their resolute support for Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, their determination to fight the American aggressors to the end, and vowing not to stop until Jinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan are liberated.

	Early this morning, when the newspaper carrying Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement arrived at the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory, more than 240 reading groups of workers in the factory rushed to read it before work and held discussion meetings. Li Congyan, an advanced producer at the factory, said at the meeting, "I am from Fujian, and my home is only 30 li away from Matsu. If these islands are not recovered for one day, the people in my hometown will not have peace for one day. No force can stop us from liberating Jinmen and Matsu. I am determined to work with more than 40 workers in my workshop to step up the production of steelmaking equipment and ensure the completion of the September production task ahead of schedule, to support Foreign Minister Chen's statement with practical actions." Labor model Li Bingzhong and fitter Wei Jiandeng both expressed great indignation at Dulles's fallacy. They said, "If American imperialism dares to touch a single hair of ours, we will resolutely eliminate it from the earth." Liao Shigang, Liu Maojue, and old worker Huang Yuancheng, well-known advanced producers at the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, expressed their firm opposition to Dulles's ulterior motives in raising the so-called "ceasefire" issue at the discussion meeting. They said, "We have not had a war with the United States, so there is no question of a 'ceasefire' at all. We are closely watching the actions of the American aggressors. If the United States does not accept the warnings of our government and Comrade Khrushchev, and does not withdraw its invading troops from the Taiwan area, and even dares to provoke a war, our 600 million people will not hesitate to make any sacrifices and will resolutely fight it to the end."

	The sailors of the Zijiang Wheel, who arrived at Chongqing Port at 7:00 pm today, after hearing Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, unanimously expressed that they would speed up the turnover of ships and ensure the transportation and supply of steel, to support Foreign Minister Chen's statement and strike at the American aggressors with practical actions.

    不收复祖国领土誓不罢休
    重庆人民决心同美国侵略者斗争到底
    新华社重庆21日电　重庆市各界人民今天纷纷集会，表示坚决拥护陈毅外交部长的声明，决心同美国侵略者斗争到底，不收复金门、马祖和解放台湾誓不罢休。
    今天一清早，当刊登陈毅外交部长声明的报纸到达重庆空气压缩机厂时，全厂二百四十多个读报组的职工都在上班前争着阅读，并举行座谈会。这个厂的先进生产者李从燕在座谈会上说，我是福建人，我的家离马祖只有三十华里，这些岛屿一天不收复，我家乡的人民就一天不得安宁。任何力量都不能阻挡我们解放金门、马祖。我决心和所在车间的四十多个工人加紧赶制炼钢设备，保证提前完成9月份的生产任务，以实际行动来拥护陈外长的声明。劳动模范李秉中和钳工魏建登对杜勒斯的谬论都表示非常气愤，他们说，美帝国主义敢于动我们一根汗毛，我们就坚决把它从地球上消灭掉。重庆建设机床厂著名先进生产者廖世刚、刘茂爵和老工人黄元成，在座谈会上表示坚决反对杜勒斯别有用心的提出所谓“停火”问题。他们说，我们没有和美国发生战争，根本谈不上“停火”的问题。我们密切注视着美国侵略者的一举一动，如果美国不接受我国政府和赫鲁晓夫同志的警告，不把侵略军队从台湾地区撤回去，甚至胆敢挑起战争，我国六亿人民决不惜任何牺牲，坚决同它斗争到底。
    今日下午七时才抵达重庆港的资江轮的海员工人们听了陈毅外长的声明后，一致表示要加快船舶周转，保证钢铁运输和供应，以实际行动来拥护陈外长的声明，打击美国侵略者。
