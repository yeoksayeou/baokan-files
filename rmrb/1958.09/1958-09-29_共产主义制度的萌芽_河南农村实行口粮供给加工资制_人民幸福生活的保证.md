Sprouts of the Communist System
Rural Henan Implements Food Rationing Plus Wage System
Guarantee of People's Happy Life

(By our reporter Kan Feng) People's communes in various parts of Henan Province are widely implementing a distribution method of partial supply of means of livelihood plus wages, to replace the original distribution system in agricultural cooperatives that simply paid based on workdays. This major reform in the distribution system is an important symbol of the unprecedented improvement in the communist ideological awareness of farmers throughout the province.

Several Supply Methods

According to statistics from the Rural Work Department of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China as of the end of August, a total of 942 communes throughout the province have implemented various forms of supply systems, accounting for 70% of the total number of people's communes in the province. Most of them implement a food rationing system, while some implement a food supply system or a basic living needs supply system. The specific contents of these three supply systems are mainly: the food rationing system is to supply the rations of all members of the commune at no cost, according to the national food supply standards. The food supply system is where the commune contracts to supply the food expenses of all members of the commune, eating in the commune canteen, with rice, vegetables, oil, salt, and firewood all free of charge. The basic living needs supply system is based on the economic conditions and consumption level of the commune to determine the scope of supply. For example, some have implemented “seven guarantees” for food, clothing, housing, childbirth, education, medical care, and weddings and funerals; some, in addition to the above, also guarantee haircuts, bathing, watching operas and movies, and heating fees, implementing "ten guarantees," or issuing subsidies.

While implementing the above-mentioned various supply systems, communes generally implement a basic wage plus bonus distribution method, based on dividing wage levels according to the strength of labor. This divides the income of the commune members into two parts: one part is distributed through the "to each according to his needs" supply system; the other part is issued through wages and labor rewards, according to the principle of "to each according to his work." According to the understanding of the Rural Work Department of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in communes implementing the food rationing system, the supply part generally accounts for about 50% of the income of the commune members, and wages account for 50%; in communes implementing the food supply system, the supply part accounts for about 60%, and wages account for 40%; in communes implementing the basic living needs supply system, the supply part generally accounts for about 80% of the income of the commune members, and wages have in fact become a living "allowance" for the commune members. However, in a small number of communes with particularly good economic foundations, such as the Qiliying People's Commune in Xinxiang County, the average consumption level of the entire commune this year is 100 yuan per person. After implementing the "seven guarantees" basic living needs supply system, wages still account for 50% of the average income of commune members.

The Foundation for Implementing the Supply System

The great leap forward in agriculture since the winter of last year has laid a solid material foundation for this new distribution system. This is not only because this year's unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture provides sufficient food for implementing the food rationing system; more importantly, it is because Henan Province has basically realized water conservancy, and will fundamentally eliminate droughts and floods. In addition, the widespread implementation of new yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing and close planting can lay a solid foundation for the rapid growth of agricultural production in the future. At the same time, with the establishment of the people's communes and the expansion of the scope of operations within the communes, it is possible to gradually achieve income every month or every quarter, thus making it possible to change the past distribution system of "pre-distribution twice a year" and implement the distribution method of paying wages on a monthly basis.

Along with the great leap forward in agricultural production and the widespread development of socialist cooperation in various production activities, the communist ideological awareness of the broad masses of farmers has been unprecedentedly improved. In recent years, taking care of and helping the "five guarantees" households and households in difficulty has also become a habit. In addition, the influence of the supply system implemented by the troops and organs in the liberated areas before the national liberation has deeply made the broad masses of farmers and cadres deeply aware that under possible conditions, the implementation of the supply system is a good way to ensure the common prosperity and common rise of all farmers. All these have become the decisive factors in promoting the widespread implementation of this new distribution system in the vast rural areas.

Four Major Benefits

The results of implementing this new distribution system in various places mainly have the following four major benefits: First, it can better eliminate various factors that cause the phenomenon of uneven wealth distribution, and ensure common prosperity and common rise. According to investigations, in the past, when the method of distribution according to workdays was implemented, each commune generally had about 10% of households with more laborers but fewer people, and their lives were not guaranteed. The implementation of this new distribution system can fundamentally eradicate their "roots of poverty." Second, farmers have become agricultural workers, and the income of commune members is fixed. After the implementation of this new distribution system in various communes, according to investigations, about 5% of households with particularly strong labor and few people have their incomes reduced compared to the past. However, after debate, especially when they recall the past situation where "planting in the land, harvesting in the sky," and their lives were not guaranteed, the vast majority of them realize that the implementation of this new distribution system has made their lives a "iron rice bowl," and they no longer have to worry about the threat of declining living standards, and they wholeheartedly express their support. Third, it can fundamentally solve the contradiction between the past management methods of work evaluation and scorekeeping, which are incompatible with the combination of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military in the people's communes and the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side occupations, and fishery. It can also save the trouble of work evaluation and scorekeeping every night, and increase the learning and rest time of commune members. Fourth, it can better expand and increase public accumulation. According to investigations, the consumption part of each commune in the province generally accounts for only about 30% of the total income this year. For example, the consumption part of commune members in the Qiliying People's Commune in Xinxiang County has increased by 50% compared to last year, but it only accounts for 20.6% of the total income; the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund account for 45.7% of the total income; an increase of nearly three times compared to last year. After the Weixing People's Commune in Suiping County implemented the food rationing system and wage system, this year's accumulation increased by more than four times compared to last year, accounting for 69.4% of the total income, and the distribution part of commune members increased by 70% compared to last year.

New Atmosphere is Taking Shape

In order to better encourage and mobilize the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, various communes have adapted to this new distribution system and conscientiously strengthened labor management. Some people's communes have stipulated that wage levels should be evaluated once a month, and a attendance system of recording absences, lateness, merits, and demerits has been established, and evaluations and rewards are conducted conscientiously. And attention has been paid to strengthening the political and ideological education work of commune members. As a result, the labor enthusiasm of commune members in various communes has been unprecedentedly high. For example, after the Qiliying People's Commune in Xinxiang County implemented the basic living needs supply system, a new atmosphere has emerged throughout the commune: more labor attendance, more work done, more responsibility, more activists, more ideological progress, more unity and friendship, more harmonious families, more children attending nurseries, more participation in learning, and less selfishness, less idleness, less illness, less outflow to cities, less quarrels, less talk of backwardness, less disobedience to leadership, less theft, and less requests for grain and money from cadres. In the past ten days alone, the accumulation of fertilizer alone has increased by 300 million jin compared to the same period last year. Many commune members of the Qugou People's Commune in Anyang County everywhere sing praises: "The Communist Party's leadership is truly wise, the people's lives are guaranteed, food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all guaranteed, having children or not having children is the same, wholeheartedly move forward, the commune will definitely be successful!" The total number of people attending work each day has increased from the original 16,634 to 23,519, an increase of more than 40% compared to the original, and many housewives and lazy people who rarely participated in production in the past have also participated in labor.

    共产主义制度的萌芽
    河南农村实行口粮供给加工资制
    人民幸福生活的保证
    本报讯  记者阚枫报道：河南省各地人民公社，正广泛推行部分生活资料供给制加工资的分配方法，来代替原来在农业社里单纯按劳动日支付的分配制度。这种在分配制度上的重大改革，是全省农民共产主义思想觉悟空前提高的重要标志。
    几种供给办法
    根据中共河南省委农村工作部截至8月底的统计，全省已经推行各种形式供给制的共有九百四十二个社，占全省人民公社总数的70％。其中大多数实行粮食供给制，还有一些实行伙食供给制或实行生活基本需要供给制。这三种供给制的具体内容主要是：粮食供给制是按照国家规定的粮食供应标准，无价供给公社全体人员的口粮。伙食供给制是由公社包干供给全社人员的伙食费，在公社食堂里吃饭，饭、菜、油、盐和烧柴等都不要钱。生活基本供给制是根据社内经济条件和社员的消费水平，确定供给范围，如有的实行了对伙食、穿衣、住房、生育、受教育、看病和婚丧等“七包”；有的除了包以上内容以外，还包理发、洗澡、看戏看电影和烤火费等，实行了“十包”，或者发给补助金。
    各社在实行上述各种供给制的同时，一般都实行了按照劳动强弱划分工资等级的基本工资加奖励的分配办法。这样就使社员的所得部分，分成了两部分，一是通过“各取所需”的供给制来分配；一是按照“按劳取酬”的原则，通过工资和劳动奖励的办法发给。根据中共河南省委农村工作部的了解，在实行粮食供给制的社里，一般供给部分占社员收入的50％左右，工资占50％；实行伙食供给制的，供给部分占60％左右，工资占40％；实行生活基本需要供给制的，供给部分一般占社员收入的80％左右，工资事实上已经变成了社员的生活“津贴”。但少数经济基础特别好的社，如新乡县七里营人民公社，今年全社每人平均消费水平一百元，实行了“七包”的生活基本需要供给制以后，工资仍然占社员平均收入的50％。
    实行供给制的基础
    去年入冬以来的农业大跃进，为这种新的分配制度打下了雄厚的物质基础。这不单是由于今年的农业空前大丰收，为实行粮食供给制提供了充足的粮食；更重要的是由于河南省已基本实现了水利化，即将从根本上消灭水旱灾，再加上深耕与密植等新的增产措施的普遍推行，能够为今后农业生产的迅速增长打下稳固基础。同时，随着人民公社的建立，社内经营范围的扩大，可以逐渐作到月月或季季都有收入，因而有可能改变过去那种“一年两次预分”的分配制度，实行按月发给工资的分配方法。
    伴随着农业生产的大跃进，和在各项生产活动中社会主义大协作的广泛开展，广大农民的共产主义思想觉悟空前提高。几年来，对“五保”户和困难户的照顾和帮助，也已成为习惯。再加上在全国解放以前解放区部队、机关实行供给制的影响，使广大农民、干部都深深地认识到在可能的条件下，实行供给制是保证全体农民共同富裕共同上升的好办法。这些都成为促进这种新的分配制度在广大农村中普遍推行的决定因素。
    四大好处
    综合各地推行这种新的分配制度的结果，主要有以下四大好处：一、能够更好地杜绝各种造成贫富不均现象的因素，保证共同富裕共同上升。根据调查，过去实行按照劳动日进行分配的方法，各社一般都有大约10％左右的人多劳动力少的户，生活没有保证。推行这种新的分配制度，便能从根本上挖掉他们的“穷根子”。二、农民变成了农业工人，社员的收入固定了。各社在推行这种新的分配制度后，根据调查，一般都有5％左右的劳动特别强、人口又少的户，他们收入要比过去减少。但是经过辩论，特别是当他们回忆起过去“种在地，收在天”，生活没有保证的情景，他们之中绝大多数都认识到实行这种新的分配制度，使自己生活变成了“铁饭碗”，不必再担心生活下降的威胁，都衷心表示拥护。三、能够从根本上解决过去那种评工记分的管理方法，与人民公社工、农、商、学、兵合一和农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展不相适应的矛盾，并且能省掉每天夜晚评工记分的麻烦，增加社员的学习和休息时间。四、能更好扩大、增加公共积累。根据调查，今年全省各社一般消费部分只占总收入的30％左右。例如新乡县七里营人民公社社员消费部分比去年增加了50％，但仅占总收入的20.6％；公积金和公益金占总收入的45.7％；较去年增加将近三倍。遂平县卫星人民公社实行了粮食供给制和工资制之后，今年积累比去年增加四倍多，占总收入的69.4％，社员分配部分比去年增加70％。
    新风气正在形成
    为了更好地鼓舞和调动广大社员的劳动积极性，各社都适应这种新的分配制度，认真加强了劳动管理。部分人民公社都规定了每月评定一次工资等级，建立了记缺勤、记迟到、记功与记过的考勤制度，认真进行评比和奖励。并且注意加强了对社员的政治思想教育工作。因而各社社员的劳动情绪空前高涨。例如新乡县七里营人民公社在实行了生活基本需要供给制以后，全社出现了劳动出勤多、做活多、负责任的多、积极分子多、思想进步的多、团结友爱多、家庭和睦多、小孩入托儿所的多、参加学习多，和自私自利的少、不劳动的少、生病的少、外流入城市的少、吵架的少、说落后话的少、不服从领导的少、偷盗的少、找干部要粮要钱的少等新气象。单是在最近十天里，只积肥一项就比去年同期多了三亿斤。安阳县曲沟人民公社许多社员到处讴歌：“共产党领导真英明，人民生活有保证，衣、食、住、行都包干，有儿无儿一样行，一心向前莫回头，公社一定能办成！”全社从原来每天出勤一万六千六百三十四人，增加到二万三千五百一十九人，比原来提高40％多，很多过去从来很少参加生产的家庭妇女和懒汉，都参加了劳动。
