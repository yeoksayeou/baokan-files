　　Battle of the Steel Mill
  　Cao Ming
    August 25th, a tense battle began at Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steel Mill.
    The Party Secretary hadn't stopped talking from early yesterday morning, when he conveyed the spirit of the central Party committee's telephone conference instructions to the three shifts of workers, until four o'clock in the middle of the night; after a hazy two or three hours of sleep at home, he has now returned to the site. When he arrived at the open-hearth furnace workshop, he saw that the battle slogan proposed by the Party committee last night, "Strive to produce twenty-nine heats of steel today," had been implemented in the actions of all the mill's workers. Look, a conspicuous banner reads: "Wherever the Party points, we will rush there." A letter of determination from the operation section is posted in front of No. 1 open-hearth furnace, reading: "Comrades of No. 1 open-hearth furnace: Whenever you tap the steel, the crane will immediately be driven to you, guaranteeing that you will produce four heats of fast steel today." After reading these, he was still uneasy and personally instructed the furnace foreman: "The second heat must be tapped before eleven o'clock, only allowed to be ahead of schedule, not behind." The furnace foreman firmly said: "Rest assured."
    The Secretary passed by No. 2 open-hearth furnace, took out blue glasses to protect his eyes, saw the molten steel boiling turbulently in the furnace, and nodded. At that time, the ladle repair workers were walking through the open-hearth furnace section with gongs and drums, with a banner promising to repair thirty-two large ladles a day. The Secretary smiled and walked to No. 3 open-hearth furnace, in front of which was posted a guarantee letter from the raw materials section: "In order to strive for twenty-nine heats of steel today, we are listening to your messages at all times, as long as you speak, we will immediately deliver the raw materials. ..." He beckoned to the furnace foreman, who ran over. He asked if shortening this heat to 6:30 would work? The furnace foreman replied: "Yes." The Secretary encouraged and inquired all the way, and each furnace foreman seriously replied, "Yes," "No problem," or at least answered, "We will definitely strive to do so." He walked to No. 6 open-hearth furnace, where a laboratory technician happened to be there delivering steel samples, in the past, the workers would send the steel samples to the laboratory. The Secretary patted the young technician's shoulder in surprise and said, "Good job, coming to the site!" The young man blushed and said: "In order to save the time of the open-hearth furnace workers, we have freed up a person to come to the workshop to collect and send steel samples. And the analysis time has been shortened to three minutes." The Secretary heard this, shook his shoulders with both hands and smiled, "Okay, then twenty-nine heats are even more certain." After the Secretary finished walking through the open-hearth furnace section, he checked the raw material section, the casting section, the dispatching room, and the laboratory one by one; in each section, there were Party and mass cadres and staff members working with the workers, or helping them carry soda. When he returned to the open-hearth furnace section, those cooks in white were diligently delivering meals to the open-hearth furnace workers. The Secretary suddenly felt a warmth in his heart, he truly felt that the Party's voice had penetrated deep into the hearts of the people and had become a material force. So he also happily picked up a shovel and mixed into the ranks of workers who were repairing the furnace.
    The factory director, who had just returned from a field meeting at the Shanghai Steel Mill, also happened to return today. As soon as he entered the factory gate, he conveyed to the workers the drive and experience of the Shanghai steel workers. The workers were truly adding fuel to the fire; they immediately put forward the slogan of "Learn from Shanghai Steel, Catch up with Shanghai Steel." It seemed like an extra boost for today's combat goals.
    Liu Mingsheng and his fellow workers had already calculated that they must produce four heats today, and their shift must strive for a new fast record for one heat. Look, the canvas work clothes he is wearing are completely wet, his eyes are shining with golden light, and how accurate and firm he is when he swings his arms. He kept running to the five furnace door openings to peep into the furnace top, looking like a tiger fighting with the flames.
    The situation of pure boiling is very good, Liu Mingsheng is delighted to see the molten steel in the furnace. Now he is just waiting for news from the laboratory before he can order the steel to be tapped. The laboratory technician ran over and said that the molten steel was qualified, Liu Mingsheng raised his hand, and the tapping bell vibrated in the open-hearth furnace workshop.
    The molten steel broke through the thick smoke with unstoppable force and came out of the trough, and suddenly golden flowers shot out, and the whole room was red. The people who were nervously welcoming the noisy molten steel then heard the loudspeaker shouting: "No. 6 open-hearth furnace has created a new fast steelmaking record of 5:15..."
    At night, when the people in the city were sleeping soundly, the heroes on the iron and steel front were striving for the victory of the last hour of the day with even more ardent enthusiasm than during the day. The passion for battle filled the entire steel mill. No. 8 open-hearth furnace was tapping the last heat of steel of the day. The flames were roaring, the steel that had been tapped was playing happily, the cranes were rumbling, and the hot blood of the steelworkers was boiling. The loudspeaker announced in a joyful voice: "Another satellite has gone into space! Another satellite has gone into space! - After a day of hard work by all the staff, a total of twenty-nine heats of steel were produced today, with an output of 5,766 tons, which is the highest daily output record of our factory. Let us celebrate today's victory together! And wish our comrades to launch another satellite in the new day!"
    Although the day's battle has come to an end, the workers' heroic fighting spirit seems to have just begun. They immediately put forward the battle slogan of "Marching towards thirty heats."

　　钢厂的战斗
  　草明
    8月25日，鞍钢第一炼钢厂一场紧张的战斗开始了。
    党委书记从昨天一早，对三班职工传达党中央召集的电话会议指示精神，到半夜四点钟就没歇过口；回家朦朦胧胧睡了两三个钟点，现在又回到现场来了。他到平炉车间一看，昨夜党委提出的战斗口号“今天为出二十九炉钢而奋战”已经贯彻到全厂职工的行动中去了。瞧，醒目的大字标语写着：“党指向哪里，我们就奔赴哪里”。一号平炉前贴着运转工段的决心书，写道：“一号平炉工友们：你们什么时候出钢，吊车就立刻开到你们跟前，保证你们今天出四炉快速钢。”他看了这些，还不放心，亲自和炉长交代说：“第二炉一定在十一点以前出，只许提前，不能拉后。”炉长坚定地说：“你放心好了”。
    书记路过二号平炉，掏出蓝镜子护着眼，看见钢水在炉子里汹涌地沸腾，点点头。那时修罐工人正敲锣打鼓走过平炉工段，写着保证一天修三十二只大罐的标语。书记微笑着走到三号平炉，炉前贴着原料工段的保证信：“为争取今天出二十九炉钢，我们时刻听你们的信，只要你们一开口，我们立刻把原料送到。……”他对炉长一招手，炉长便跑步前来。他问他这一炉缩短到六点半成不成？炉长答道：“可以”。书记就这样一路鼓动一路查询，每个炉长都严肃地答道：“行”，“没问题”，起码也回答说：“一定争取这样做”。他走到六号平炉，化验员正好前来送钢样，过去都是工友把钢样送到化验室去的。书记奇怪地拍了拍年青化验员的肩膀说：“好样的，到现场来啦！”小伙子红着脸说：“为了节省平炉工友的时间，我们腾出一个人来到车间取、送钢样。并且把化验时间缩短成三分钟。”书记听了，双手摇着他的肩膀笑着说：“行啦，二十九炉就更有把握啦。”书记走完了平炉工段，便到原料工段、铸工段、调度室、化验室逐一检查；各个工段都有党群干部和职员和工人们一块儿劳动，或帮他们扛汽水。等到他又回到平炉工段时，那些穿白衣服的炊事员正殷勤地给平炉工友送着饭菜呢。书记心里头忽然一阵热乎乎的，他确实感到党的声音已深入人心，已变成了物质的力量了。于是他也高兴地操起铁锹来，混在正在补炉的工人队伍里。
    刚从上海炼钢厂开现场会议回来的厂长今天也正好回来了，一进厂门，他便向职工传达上海钢铁工人的干劲和经验。工人们听了，真是火上添油；立刻提出了“学上钢、赶上钢”的口号。对于今天的战斗目标，好像加了一把劲。
    刘明生和工友们已核计好：今天一定要出四炉，本班要争取出一炉快速新纪录。瞅，他身上穿的帆布作业服已全湿了，两眼金光闪闪，胳膊一摆时多么准确和坚定。他不断地跑到五个炉门洞去窥探炉顶，活像一头和烈焰搏斗的老虎。
    纯沸腾的情况很好，刘明生望着炉内的钢水心花怒放。现在他只等化验室的消息就可下令出钢了。化验员跑步过来说钢水合格，刘明生把手一扬，出钢的钟声震荡着平炉车间。
    钢水以不可阻拦的力量冲破浓烟，脱槽而出，顿时金花四射，满屋红光。紧张地迎接喧哗的钢水的人们这时听见广播器叫嚷着：“六号平炉创造了五点十五分的快速炼钢新纪录……”
    入夜，市内人们安静地睡熟了，钢铁战线上的英雄们正以比白天更炽烈的热情争取一天中最后一小时的胜利。战斗的激情洋溢着整个炼钢厂。八号平炉出着一天中最后的一炉钢。烈焰在喧闹，脱了槽的钢水在耍欢，吊车隆隆山响，钢铁工人的热血正在沸腾。广播器用欢乐的声音宣布说：“又一个卫星上天了！又一个卫星上天了！——经过全体职工一天的奋战，今天共出二十九炉钢，产量达五千七百六十六吨，是我厂最高的日产量纪录，让我们一同庆祝今天的胜利！并预祝同志们在新的一天中再放个卫星！”
    一天的战斗虽告结束，但工人的豪迈的斗志仿佛才开始。他们立刻又提出“向三十炉迈进”的战斗口号。
