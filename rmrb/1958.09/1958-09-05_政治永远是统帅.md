　　Politics Is Always in Command
　　Yiqing

　　Whether politics takes command always determines the success or failure of our work. The recent experiences of the Capital Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Non-Ferrous Metals Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in the technological revolution once again prove that this is an irrefutable truth. The Capital Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry paid attention to grasping political and ideological work, and promptly discovered and corrected various erroneous ideas that hindered the technological revolution. As a result, the technological revolution developed rapidly. The Non-Ferrous Metals Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry did not grasp political and ideological work, and as a result, the technological revolution could not be carried out. They had to turn back to grasping political and ideological work in order to clear the ideological obstacles hindering the technological revolution.

　　Politics is something we cannot leave for a moment in all our work, because building socialism itself is a great political task, and all our professional work and all our technical work serve this overall political task. Without it, we will lose our motivation and direction. In this sense, so-called purely professional work and purely technical work that are completely detached from politics simply do not exist. Moreover, how does each of us do our specific professional work and technical work? That is to say, how do we serve the overall political task of building socialism? Is it with high morale, striving for the top, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economically? Or is it the opposite? This is not a professional or technical issue, but a real political and ideological issue. From this, we can see that politics and technology, or politics and profession, coexist and are inseparable in any work and in any person; they are a unity of opposites. At the same time, it should also be seen that in this unity of opposites, politics is the dominant aspect of the contradiction, it determines the nature of things, and determines the direction of technological and professional development. Therefore, if we do not grasp politics and only grasp profession in any work, we will inevitably lose a clear direction and fall into the circle of specific professions. As a result, just like the Non-Ferrous Metals Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in the previous period, professional work cannot be grasped either.

　　Some people say, "During the rectification campaign, politics was put in command every day, ideological problems were solved, and awareness was raised. Why is it still necessary to emphasize putting politics in command now?" These comrades do not understand that putting politics in command is not only needed in political movements, but also in all work; it is not only needed in a certain period, but also in a long period, and even forever. It is not necessary to say that the classes in our country have not yet been completely eliminated, and there is still class struggle. In addition to class struggle, there are also contradictions among the people, so we cannot do without putting politics in command. Even in the future, when we reach a communist society, although class struggle will be gone, contradictions among the people will continue to exist. The ten fingers will not be the same length. At that time, differences in people's ideology will still exist, and there will still be struggles between the advanced and the backward, and between truth and fallacy. To solve the problem of the advanced leading the backward and truth overcoming fallacy, it is still necessary to put politics in command. Therefore, it can be affirmed that as long as society continues to develop, as long as our cause continues to advance, the unity of politics and profession, the unity of politics and technology, and the situation in which politics is in command and is the soul in the unity will exist forever.

　　Everyone puts politics in command, everything puts politics in command, and always puts politics in command. Everyone who is willing to devote himself to the highest ideals of mankind should take this as his motto.

　　政治永远是统帅
　　谊清
    政治是否挂帅，永远决定我们工作的成败，煤炭部基建司和冶金部有色金属研究院最近在技术革命中的经验，再一次证明了这是颠扑不破的真理。煤炭部基建司注意抓政治思想工作，及时发现和纠正了各种阻碍技术革命的错误思想，于是，技术革命迅速开展起来。冶金部有色金属研究院，没有抓政治思想工作，结果技术革命革不下去，只好回过头来抓政治思想工作，才扫清了阻碍技术革命的思想障碍。
    政治，本来就是我们一切工作不可以须臾离的东西，因为建设社会主义本身就是一个伟大的政治任务，我们的一切业务工作，一切技术工作都为这个总的政治任务服务。离开了它，就会失却动力，迷失方向。就这一点说，完全脱离政治的所谓单纯业务工作和单纯技术工作是根本不存在的。而且，我们每一个人是怎样作自己的具体业务工作和技术工作呢？也就是说，是怎样为建设社会主义这个总的政治任务服务呢？是鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省？还是相反？这又不是什么业务问题和技术问题，而是确确实实的政治问题和思想问题了。从这里可以看出：政治和技术，或者政治和业务，在任何一件工作上，在任何一个人身上是同时存在的，不可分割的，是矛盾的统一体。同时，还应该看到，在这个矛盾的统一体中，政治是矛盾的主导方面，它决定事物的性质，决定技术和业务发展的方向。因此，干任何一件工作，如果不抓政治，只抓业务，一定会失去明确的方向，陷入具体业务的圈子，结果，就像前一时期冶金部有色金属研究院那样，业务也没办法抓起来。
    有人说：“整风运动当中，天天政治挂帅，思想问题解决了，觉悟提高了，现在，怎么还强调政治挂帅呢？”这些同志不了解，政治挂帅，不仅在政治运动中需要，在一切工作中同样需要；不仅在一定时期需要，而且长时期需要，甚至永远需要。不必说我国现在的阶级还没有最后消灭，还有阶级斗争，除了阶级斗争，还有人民内部矛盾，因而还离不开政治挂帅，就是将来到了共产主义社会，阶级斗争虽然没有了，人民内部矛盾还会存在下去。十个指头不会一般齐，到那时，人们之间的思想意识同样存在着差异，仍然会有先进和落后之间的斗争，真理和谬误之间的斗争。要解决先进带动落后，真理战胜谬误的问题，依然是需要政治挂帅。因此，可以肯定，只要社会不断发展，只要我们的事业不断前进，政治和业务的统一，政治和技术的统一，而且在统一中政治是统帅、是灵魂的情况，将要永远存在下去。
    人人政治挂帅，事事政治挂帅，永远政治挂帅。一切愿意为人类最高理想献身的人，应该把这个作为自己的座右铭。
