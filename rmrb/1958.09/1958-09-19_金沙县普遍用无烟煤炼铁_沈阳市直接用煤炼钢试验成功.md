    Jinsha County Universally Uses Anthracite Coal for Iron Smelting
    Shenyang City Successfully Experiments with Direct Coal Steelmaking
    (Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports that Jinsha County, Guizhou Province, is universally promoting the use of anthracite coal for iron smelting, overcoming the difficulty of coke shortages. In August, all of the more than 700 blast furnaces in the county that were put into production used anthracite coal as fuel.
    In the past, some people in the county had the notion that "anthracite coal cannot be used to make iron." After analyzing the county's use of anthracite coal for iron smelting, the county party committee firmly believed that anthracite coal ironmaking was entirely possible. It requested that leaders at the county, district, and township levels vigorously engage in experimental furnaces, with each district forming a technical research group and each factory forming a technical guidance group. Soon, 47 technical research groups were established throughout the county.
    The county party committee established an "Industrial Cadre Red and Expert School" at the Jinjiagou Iron Plant in Yankong District. The county party committee personally led and conducted serious research on some technical issues in using anthracite coal for iron smelting, summarized experience, and trained cadres. The county party committee, in charge of industry, also led all the cadres of the iron and steel office to open up an experimental field with two blast furnaces in Pingba District. They worked day and night, exploring the experience of operating anthracite coal ironmaking: selecting good ore, selecting good coal, and increasing the wind power. This experience promptly guided the production of anthracite coal ironmaking throughout the county. Subsequently, the Oriental 101 Iron Plant in Yumo District successfully used anthracite coal for all iron smelting. The county party committee immediately convened an emergency meeting, instructing other districts to immediately send cadres to visit and learn on-site at the Yumo District, and demanding the rapid and comprehensive promotion of their experience. It also requested that they continue to experiment and innovate technology during the promotion, and learn wherever there was creation. Within a few days, 21 blast furnaces in Anluo District were all put into production using anthracite coal as fuel, and most of the blast furnaces produced iron normally. This further summarized a relatively complete experience of anthracite coal ironmaking.
    With the continuous improvement of ironmaking technology, the iron production of many blast furnaces with a planned daily output of two tons increased from the original 1,600 jin to 2,900 jin to 3,400 jin. In the past, when anthracite coal was used for iron smelting, the furnace had to be repaired every three to five days, but now it can be produced continuously for 30 to 40 days.
    (Our Newspaper) Reporters Sun Minghui and Gu Feng report: A new method of direct coal-fired steelmaking has recently been successfully tested on a small open-hearth furnace built in Shenyang. This is a technological innovation in China's steelmaking industry. This type of small open-hearth furnace is suitable for county and township development.
    The new method of direct coal-fired steelmaking was researched and tested by teachers and students of the Department of Iron and Steel Metallurgy of Northeast Institute of Technology on a small open-hearth furnace they designed and built themselves, based on the bold idea of coal-fired steelmaking proposed by the Metallurgical Furnace Teaching and Research Section. After more than a month of testing, they finally produced the first batch of standard-quality carbon steel on August 2nd.
    For many years, metallurgists in some countries have believed that the fuel needed for steelmaking cannot be coal directly. Instead, bituminous coal must be made into coal gas with a very high combustion temperature to produce standard steel. Because the construction of open-hearth furnaces requires the addition of many devices for manufacturing or recovering coal gas, the investment is large, and the quality requirements of bituminous coal used for manufacturing coal gas are very high. Therefore, people have always believed that open-hearth furnace construction is most suitable in modernly equipped iron and steel complexes; centrally building medium or large open-hearth furnaces is more cost-effective than building small open-hearth furnaces in a decentralized manner. This is an important reason why there are so few small open-hearth furnaces being built in various places. The success of the Northeast Institute of Technology in creating a small coal-fired furnace breaks the long-standing convention in the world's steelmaking industry technology and opens up a broad path for implementing the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises in open-hearth steelmaking.
    This small open-hearth furnace, which directly uses coal as fuel for steelmaking, absorbs all the advantages of large open-hearth furnace smelting technology. In terms of utilizing raw materials and the types of products produced, this small open-hearth furnace has great advantages over converters. It can use 100% pig iron blocks, 100% scrap steel blocks, or any proportion of mixed raw materials to smelt a wide variety of steel grades according to needs, and the consumption of metal raw materials in smelting is less than that of converters. Charging one ton of metal raw materials can produce more than one ton of steel.
    Like small converters, this type of small open-hearth furnace has the characteristics of low investment and fast construction. In particular, it is easier to master in terms of technical operation than converters. Because coal is directly used as fuel for smelting, the coal gas manufacturing equipment required for large or medium-sized open-hearth furnaces is eliminated. Its furnace structure is relatively simple, requiring only a certain amount of refractory bricks, and using much less steel and mechanical devices than converters. The quality requirements for the bituminous coal needed for smelting are not very high, and the electricity needed is also limited. Wherever there are small blast furnaces and bituminous coal mines, these small open-hearth furnaces can be built in large numbers.

    金沙县普遍用无烟煤炼铁
    沈阳市直接用煤炼钢试验成功
    本报讯　贵州省金沙县普遍推广无烟煤炼铁，克服焦炭不足的困难。8月间全县七百多座投入生产的高炉，用的燃料都是无烟煤。
    过去这个县有些人曾有过“无烟煤不能炼铁”的论调。县委分析了全县用无烟煤炼铁的情况后，坚定不移地认为无烟煤炼铁是完全可能的事。要求县、区、乡的领导干部大搞试验炉，各区组成技术研究组，各厂组成技术指导组。很快全县就成立了四十七个技术研究组。
    县委在岩孔区金家沟铁厂办了一个“工业干部红专学校”，县委亲自领导，对用无烟煤炼铁的一些技术问题进行了认真的研究，总结经验，培养干部。主管工业的县委，又领导钢铁办公室的全体干部，在平坝区开辟了一个有两座高炉的试验田。他们夜以继日地进行苦战，摸索出无烟煤炼铁操作的经验。选好矿、选好煤、加大风力。这一经验，及时指导了全县推广无烟煤炼铁的生产。接着，禹谟区东方一零一铁厂全部用无烟煤炼铁成功。县委立即召开了紧急会议，指定其他区马上派干部到禹谟区现场参观学习，要求迅速全面推广他们的经验。并且要求在推广中继续试验，革新技术，那里有创造就到那里学习。在几天内，安洛区有二十一个高炉全部用无烟煤做燃料投入了生产，同时绝大多数高炉出铁正常。从而进一步总结出了比较完整的无烟煤炼铁的经验。
    随着炼铁技术的不断提高，不少计划日产两吨高炉的出铁量，由原来的一千六百斤上升到二千九百斤至三千四百斤。过去用无烟煤炼铁，每隔三、五天就要修一次炉子，现在可以连续生产三十至四十天。
    本报讯　记者孙铭惠、谷峰报道：直接用煤作燃料炼钢的新方法最近在沈阳市创建的一座小型平炉上试验成功。这是我国炼钢工业技术上一个创举。这种小型平炉适宜于县乡兴办。
    直接用煤作燃料炼钢的新方法，是由东北工学院钢铁冶金系的师生，根据冶金炉教研室提出的烧煤炼钢这个大胆的想法，在自己设计、自己创建的小型平炉上进行研究试验的。他们经过一个多月的试验，终于在8月2日炼出了第一炉质量达到标准的炭素钢。
    许多年来，有些国家的冶金工作者一直认为，炼钢所需要的燃料，不能直接用煤，必须把烟煤制成燃烧温度很高的煤气，才能炼出合乎标准的钢来。由于平炉建设中需要增添许多制造或回收煤气的设备，投资数量大，而且制造煤气用的烟煤的质量要求又很高，因此人们又一直认为，炼钢平炉建设在有现代化装备的钢铁联合企业中最为适宜；集中地建设中型或大型的平炉，比分散地建设小型平炉合算。这就是目前各地建设小型平炉很少的一个重要原因。东北工学院创造用煤作燃料的小型平炉成功的事实，打破了多年来世界炼钢工业技术上的常规，为平炉炼钢贯彻大中小相结合的方针，开拓了一条宽广的道路。
    这种直接用煤作燃料炼钢的小型平炉，吸收了大平炉冶炼技术上的各种优点。在利用原料和生产的品种方面，这种小平炉比转炉有很大的优越性。它用百分之百的生铁块，用百分之百的废钢块，或是用任何比例的混合原料，都能根据需要，冶炼出种类繁多的钢种，而且在冶炼中消耗的金属原料比转炉要少，装入一吨金属原料，能炼出一吨以上的钢。
    这种小型平炉和小型转炉一样，都具有投资少、建设快的特点，特别是在技术操作上比转炉更易掌握。由于直接用煤作冶炼的燃料，省掉了大型或中型平炉所需的煤气制造设备。它的炉体构造比较简单，只需要一定数量的耐火砖，用的钢材和机械装置比转炉少得多。冶炼中所需要的烟煤，质量要求不很高，需要的电力也有限。凡是有小高炉和有烟煤矿的地方，都可以大量兴办这种小平炉。
