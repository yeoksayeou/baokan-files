The incident of American troops bombarding Lulong villages must never be repeated

    In a village, peasants held accusation and protest rallies with great emotion, opposing the new provocations of American imperialism against our country. Li Wanfu, a young farmer, holding a dark black artillery shell casing, jumped onto the high platform and shouted angrily: "This is the ironclad proof of the American devils bombing our village thirteen years ago. We have not forgotten this hatred, and we will settle this account with American imperialism!"
    This village is the "certain village" in Lulong, eastern Hebei (now belonging to Changli County) that was bombarded by the U.S. military in 1945, which was not initially identified – Datianzhuang. At that time, the U.S. Marine Corps occupied the Beining Railway line in our country, helping and participating in the civil war manufactured by the Chiang gang. American soldiers went out every day to rape and pillage, endangering the lives and property of the peasants, who hated them to the bone. On December 4th, two American devils again fired guns and invaded near Datianzhuang, six miles southwest of Anshan Station, to commit atrocities. The local heroic militiamen could not bear it any longer and rose up in self-defense, eliminating them in one fell swoop. Subsequently, the U.S. military unscrupulously looted the village. At that time, the Associated Press made such an admission: "In a certain village, two Chinese people dressed as civilians killed American soldiers, and the U.S. military gave the village chief one and a half hours to hand over the shooters. After one and a half hours, when the two people were not handed over, the U.S. military bombarded the village." This incident angered all the Chinese people. At that time, the "Liberation Daily" in Yan'an published an editorial protesting seriously to the United States.
    Thirteen years later, when American imperialism is using the same methods as it did back then to expand its aggression in the Taiwan Strait of our country, the reporter came to the Anshan Station (now called Jiulongshan) area to find this village, to understand how the farmers there are showing their righteous indignation about the old hatred and the new, and what actions they are going to take. At noon on September 9th, with the help of the local Party committee and the masses, it was quickly clarified that the village was Datianzhuang. As I passed through the fields of sorghum and corn, a scene of harvest with red and yellow colors, and arrived in the village, the township people's committee immediately found many people: white-haired old men, middle-aged farm women, young men in their twenties... They were all victims and witnesses of the atrocities of the American military. The first to pour out his heart to me was a seventy-two-year-old man with white beard and hair. It turned out that he was the village chief Li Rongsheng who refused to accept the "ultimatum" of the U.S. military back then. He excitedly recounted all the details of everything that happened back then. When he talked about the bravery of the militiamen in striking the American devils who came to commit atrocities, he immediately smiled happily, stroked his beard lightly, and made a shooting gesture, saying: "Two 'bang-bang' sounds, and the devils were knocked down. One died on the spot, and the other pretended to be dead for a while, and escaped back to the stronghold with stinking blood all the way." The old man went on to say: "I heard that the American bandits want to invade us again now. I want to tell the American bandits: The Chinese people are not to be trifled with! If they dare to come again, we will hit one for every one, and two for every pair, and we will not let one of them escape!"
    After talking, the farmers took me to see the traces left by the U.S. military's barbaric bombardment of the village. The most prominent of the relics is the house of the elementary school principal, Li Fachun. Principal Li's old mother was at home, and she guided us to look carefully at the west wall built between the bricks and stones. Under the setting sun, this wall showed countless scars all over its body, broken by artillery shells; as big as basketballs, as big as peaches, as big as broad beans, deep, shallow... all clearly visible.
    When we were inspecting the crimes of the U.S. military, the young farmer Li Wanfu came and took me to his house, took out the American artillery shell casing from the cabinet - another ironclad proof of the crimes of the U.S. military. He said that he was only twelve years old that year. When the American devils bombarded, he was both afraid and hateful. He hid at home, and he counted every time the devils fired a cannon. He counted twenty-seven shots in total. After the devils left, he picked up this artillery shell casing, hid it, and remembered it. With the passage of time, with the increase in the crimes of American imperialism in invading China, the seeds of this hatred have also grown day by day in his young mind. Now, this strong young man who is already twenty-five years old has already joined the Communist Youth League, and recently became a militiaman. He is determined to stand against the American aggressors.
    That night, the Hongxing People's Commune, including Datianzhuang, happened to hold a ten-thousand-person rally to accuse and protest the provocations of American imperialism. The central venue was set up in this Datianzhuang, which had old hatred and new hatred with American imperialism. At the beginning of the meeting, people were so excited and indignant. First, the old man Li Rongsheng made a long accusation, and then, representatives of all the commune members: young people, women, teachers, demobilized soldiers, one by one accused and protested the crimes of the American aggressors. At this time, fists were raised throughout the venue, and angry voices resounded through the clouds:
    "American imperialism get out of Taiwan!"
    "We want to settle accounts with the American devils!"
    "Warn the American imperialists: the Chinese people are not to be trifled with!"
    The fire of hatred thirteen years ago is burning even more fiercely today. Finally, the commander of the newly established Datianzhuang Township Militia Regiment announced that in order to respond to the new provocations of American imperialism, from now on, everyone will be a soldier, and the guns will be aimed at the American bandits, and the incident of American troops bombarding our village must never be repeated on any land of the motherland.

### 美军炮轰卢龙乡村的事件绝不许重演

    美军炮轰卢龙乡村的事件绝不许重演
    在一个村庄上，农民们激动万分地举行控诉、抗议大会，反对美帝国主义对我国进行新的挑衅。青年农民李万富拿着一只深黑色的炮弹筒，跳上了高高的讲台，愤怒地高呼：“这是十三年前美国鬼子炮轰咱村的铁证，我们没有忘记这个仇恨，我们要和美帝清算这笔账！”
    这个村庄就是1945年遭受美军残暴轰击的当初没有查明的冀东卢龙“某乡村”——大田庄（现在属昌黎县）。那时，美国海军陆战队盘踞了我国北宁铁路沿线，帮助和参与蒋帮制造内战。美国兵每天四出奸淫掳掠，危害农民生命财产安全，农民们恨之入骨。12月4日，两个美国鬼子又鸣枪侵入安山车站西南六里的大田庄附近行凶，当地英勇的民兵忍无可忍奋起自卫，一举歼灭了他们。随后，美军即无法无天地对这个村庄进行洗劫。当时美联社作了这样的供认：“在某乡村，两个穿老百姓衣服的中国人打死了美国兵，美军即限该村村长在一点半钟内交出开枪的人来，一点半钟过后，两个人没有被交出，美军即炮轰该村”。这一事件，触怒了全中国人民，当时延安“解放日报”曾为此发表社论，向美国提出严重抗议。
    十三年后的今天，当美帝国主义又使用当年同样的手段，在我国台湾海峡扩大侵略的时候，记者来到安山车站（现在叫九龙山）一带，寻访这个乡村，了解那里的农民们对于旧仇新恨表现出怎样的义愤，将要采取怎样的行动。9月9日中午，由于当地党委和群众的帮助，很快便弄清了那个乡村就是大田庄。当我穿过高粱、玉米红黄相间一片丰收景象的田野来到村中，乡人民委员会立刻找来了许许多多的人：白发苍苍的老翁、中年的农妇、二十几岁的青年小伙子……他们全是美军暴行的受害者和见证人。最先向我倾诉的是一位须眉皆白的七十二岁的老人，原来他就是当年拒绝接受美军“最后通牒”的那位村长李荣生。他激动地向我叙述当年的一切细节详情。当他谈到当时民兵神勇打击前来行凶的美国鬼子的时候，顿时喜笑颜开，轻捋着胡须，做着射击的手势说：“叭叭两响，把鬼子甩倒了，当场死了一个，另一个装死了一会儿，一路上流着臭血逃回据点去了”。老人接着说：“听说美国强盗现在又想侵略我们了，我要告诉美国强盗：中国老百姓不是好惹的！他敢再来，来一个打一个，来两个打一双，一个也不让他逃走！”
    谈完以后，农民们带我去观看美军蛮横炮轰村庄时留下来的痕迹。遗迹最显著的是小学校长李发春的房子，李校长的老母亲在家，她指引我们仔细地看了砖石间砌的西墙，这堵墙在夕阳照射下，显露出了全身被炮弹崩破的无数伤痕；篮球大的、桃子大的、豆瓣大的、深的、浅的……历历在目。
    当我们察看美军罪迹的时候，那个青年农民李万富找来了，把我带到他的家里，从柜中拿出了那个美国的炮弹筒——美军罪行的又一铁证。他说，那一年他才十二周岁，美国鬼子轰炮时他又怕又恨，躲在家里，鬼子打一炮他就数一下，一共数了二十七炮。鬼子走后，他拣回这个炮弹筒，藏起来，记住它。随着年月的推移，随着美帝国主义侵略中国的罪行的增加，这个仇恨的种子也在他那幼小的心灵里日益增长了起来。现在，这个已经二十五岁的健壮的小伙子，早已参加了共产主义青年团，最近又当上了民兵，他决心和美国侵略者势不两立。
    这天晚上，包括大田庄在内的红星人民公社正好举行万人大会，控诉和抗议美帝国主义的挑衅，中心会场就设在这个和美帝有着旧仇新恨的大田庄。会议一开始，人们就是那样的激动和愤慨。首先由李荣生老翁作了长时间的控诉，接着，全公社社员的代表：青年、妇女、教师、复员军人，一个个控诉和抗议美国侵略者的罪行。这时全场铁拳高举，愤怒的声音响彻云霄：
    “美帝国主义滚出台湾去！”
    “我们要和美国鬼子算账！”
    “警告美帝：中国老百姓不是好惹的！”
    十三年前的仇恨之火，今天又更加炽热地燃烧起来了。最后，新成立的大田庄乡民兵团的团长宣布，为了回答美帝国主义新的挑衅，从现在起，实行全民皆兵，把枪口对准美国强盗，绝不让美军炮轰咱村的事件在祖国任何土地上重演。
