Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 8th – The No. 3 open hearth furnace in the open hearth steelmaking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, which created the three-tap steelmaking method, continuously set two new records for shortening smelting time on the 6th. The first heat of steel produced by this furnace in the morning took only five hours and five minutes, shortening the previous record by thirty-three minutes; the second heat of steel produced at noon broke this record again, taking only four hours and fifty-one minutes, with an effective utilization rate of sixteen.

In the past two days, Li Xiaolin, Secretary of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Duan Jirui, Deputy Secretary, Yang Faqi, Secretary of the Steelmaking Department Party Committee, Yan Tao, Director of the Department, and others have gone down to the workshops to work shifts, studying with the steelworkers to adopt methods such as replacing silica bricks with chrome-magnesia bricks, increasing furnace temperature, and promoting rapid steelmaking, so that steel production has rapidly increased.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 8th – All the employees of the Youth Blast Furnace in the Ironmaking Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant took practical actions to support Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area, and the iron smelted on the 7th exceeded the national plan by 13.7%, with all pig iron quality meeting standards.

This ironmaking achievement was created by the workers under the slogan of seizing every second, producing more and faster steel to support the liberation of Taiwan, and crushing the military provocations of U.S. imperialism.

　　太钢创新纪录
　　三号平炉有效利用系数达到十六
　　青年高炉日产量超过计划13.7％
    新华社太原8日电　创造三槽出钢的太原钢铁厂平炉炼钢部的三号平炉，6日连续创造两次缩短冶炼时间的新纪录。这个平炉在早晨出的第一炉钢，只用了五小时零五分，比过去最高纪录缩短三十三分；中午出的第二炉钢，又突破了这个纪录，只用了四小时五十一分，有效利用系数达到十六。
    最近两天，中共太原钢铁厂委员会书记李晓林、副书记段集锐，炼钢部党委书记杨发棋、部主任岩涛等，都下到车间跟班劳动，同炼钢工人一道研究采取铬镁砖代替矽砖、增加炉温、推广快速炼钢等办法，使钢产量迅速上升。
    新华社太原8日电　太原钢铁厂炼铁部青年高炉的全体职工以实际行动拥护周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，在7日炼出的铁超过国家计划13.7％，生铁质量全部合格。
    这个炼铁成绩，是职工们在分秒必争、更多、更快地生产钢铁支援解放台湾，粉碎美帝国主义的军事挑衅的口号下创造出来的。
