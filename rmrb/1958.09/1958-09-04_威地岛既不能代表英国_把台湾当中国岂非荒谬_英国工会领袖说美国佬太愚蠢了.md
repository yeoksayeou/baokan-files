Xinhua News Agency, Boon-Moos, 2nd. Delegates attending the British Trades Union Congress meeting here condemned the US policy of war provocations against China.

Brooks, Chairman of the Draughtsmen's and Allied Technicians' Association in the British Engineering and Shipbuilding Industries, told Xinhua reporters: "The tension in the Taiwan Strait is caused by the stupidity of the Yanks."

He said: "As far as we are concerned, we believe that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory. This was made clear in the Cairo Declaration when Chiang Kai-shek was still in power. Whatever changes there have been in the Chinese government since then should not have any impact on this."

He said: "It is stupid for the United States not to recognize the real Chinese government. In my opinion, the United States recognizing Taiwan as representing China is as absurd as recognizing the Isle of Wight as representing Britain."

He added that we don't know what the United States will do in the current situation in the Taiwan Strait, "but one thing is certain: if the United States supports Chiang Kai-shek and goes to war with China, it will be fighting alone."

Another delegate, Brennan of the British Union of Post Office Workers, told Xinhua reporters: "Taiwan is part of China, and this is indisputable." He believes that the US policy towards China is unwise. "They should get rid of all obligations to protect Chiang Kai-shek and obstruct the real China from obtaining a seat in the United Nations." He said, "How can world problems be solved and peace be achieved without the presence of a major power like China?"

He hopes that the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully and believes that the decisive factor hindering a peaceful solution is the presence of US troops in Taiwan.

　　威地岛既不能代表英国
    把台湾当中国岂非荒谬
    英国工会领袖说美国佬太愚蠢了
    新华社菩恩穆斯2日电　正在这里出席英国职工大会会议的代表们谴责美国对中国进行战争挑衅的政策。
    英国机器制造和造船业绘图员工会主席布鲁克斯对新华社记者说：“台湾海峡的紧张局势是由于美国佬的愚蠢造成的。”
    他说：“从我们来说，我们认为台湾是中国领土的一部分。当蒋介石还在执政的时候，开罗宣言中就已经明确了这一点。不管从那以后中国的政府有了什么变迁都不应对此产生任何影响。”
    他说：“美国不承认真正的中国政府是愚蠢的。在我看来，美国承认台湾代表中国，正好像承认威地岛代表英国一样的荒谬。”
    他又说，我们不知道美国在目前台湾海峡的形势中会做到什么地步，“但是可以肯定：如果美国支持蒋介石而同中国开战，它将孤立作战。”
    另一个代表、英国邮政工人联合会的布伦南对新华社记者说：“台湾是中国的一部分，这是无可争辩的。”他认为，美国对中国的政策是不明智的。“他们应该摆脱为保护蒋介石和阻挠真正的中国在联合国取得席位所承担的一切义务。”他说，“如果没有像中国那样的大国出席，又怎么能解决世界问题和取得和平呢？”
    他希望台湾问题能和平解决，并且认为阻挠和平解决的决定性因素在于美国军队驻在台湾。
