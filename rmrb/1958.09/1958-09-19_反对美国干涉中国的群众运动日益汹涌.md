Mass Movement Against US Interference in China Gathers Momentum
Romanian and Albanian People Urge the United States to Immediately Stop Playing with Fire
New Delhi Public Rally Warns that US Interference in China is a Challenge to Asia
Canadian People Demonstrate in Front of US Consulate General to Protest US Aggression

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, September 17th: People across Romania continue to hold protest rallies, resolutely demanding an immediate end to the United States' playing with fire in the Taiwan Strait area.

Workers in Hunedoara, the center of Romania's steel industry, held workshop rallies on September 17th to protest US provocative acts against China. Workers at the meetings stated that they would work harder to strengthen the power of their motherland. If the situation requires, they will, together with the people of the Soviet Union and other socialist camp countries, as well as peace-loving people around the world, give a resolute blow to the unrepentant US imperialism.

In the past few days, more than 48,000 people from enterprises, institutions, state farms, and machine tractor stations in the Yasi region have participated in rallies protesting the provocative acts of US imperialism. More than 2,200 people spoke at these meetings. Collective farmers and individual farmers in the state also held 600 protest rallies, condemning US imperialism's actions in creating tension in the Taiwan Strait area.

At many protest rallies held throughout the Stalin region, working people unanimously agreed that aggression against the Chinese people is aggression against the Romanian people. They expressed their firm support for the Chinese people's struggle for justice.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, September 17th: People in various parts of Albania have been holding rallies in recent days to protest the provocative acts of US imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area and to support the just struggle of the Chinese people.

Worker Heiba of the Valona Lenin Cement Plant pointed out in his speech at a factory rally that imperialists and their servants should know that the era when a warship could be sent to the Pacific to enslave the whole of Asia is long gone. Today, we live in the socialist era. If they dare to launch an attack on China, they will surely be destroyed.

Workers at the Marx Hydropower Plant said at a rally that imperialism should understand that touching China is tantamount to touching the entire socialist camp with 900 million people, which can give every aggressor the punishment they deserve at any time.

Workers at the Tirana Textile Cooperative passed a resolution at a rally supporting the fraternal Chinese people.

Workers at the Skutari Cement Plant stated in a telegram to the Chinese Embassy in Albania that they would always stand with the fraternal Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 16th: A public rally held here tonight strongly demanded that the US air and naval forces immediately withdraw from the Taiwan area, return Taiwan and the coastal islands to China, and restore China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

Many prominent Indian figures participated in the rally convened by the Indian Asian-African Solidarity Committee. Chinese Ambassador to India Pan Zili and diplomatic officials from some Eastern European countries also attended the rally.

Mrs. Nehru, chairman of the Indian Asian-African Solidarity Committee, who presided over the meeting, said that the Taiwan issue is "China's internal affair, and the United States has no reason to interfere. China's demand to merge Taiwan with the mainland is a legitimate demand, just as we demand the merger of Goa to complete our own independence."

The famous Indian economist Gian Chand said at the rally that US interference in Taiwan is a challenge to the awakened forces of Asia. The Indian people's call in support of the Chinese people is a signal to the Western countries: "The Asian revival movement will continue, and the Indian people will join it and accelerate its realization." He said, "The Indian people show that we stand with the forces of the future." His remarks aroused cheers from the audience.

Communist Party member of parliament, Hiren Mukerjee, condemned the shameless provocative acts of the United States in the Far East. He said that after the imperialists suffered defeat in West Asia, they attempted to stir up trouble in the Far East. "The United States hopes that colonialism will make a comeback, but the Asian people cannot tolerate it. Taiwan belonged to China long before Columbus discovered America." He said that such calls are coming from all parts of India: "Stop interfering in China, the United States get out of Chinese territorial waters, restore China's sovereignty over Taiwan, and restore China's legitimate seat in the United Nations."

The meeting passed a resolution proposed by Govinda Reddy, a member of parliament of the Congress Party and secretary of the Indian Asian-African Solidarity Committee, condemning the United States for deploying military forces in the Taiwan area. The resolution pointed out that Taiwan and the coastal islands belong to the People's Republic of China, and the People's Republic of China has every right to liberate these islands. The resolution concluded by expressing the hope that the Sino-US talks will be successful "on the basis of recognizing the legitimate rights of the Chinese people."

Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: Toronto News: According to a report in the Canadian "Tribune" on the 15th, the Canadian people held a demonstration in front of the US Consulate General in Toronto on the 9th to oppose US interference in China's internal affairs. The placards held by the demonstrators read slogans such as "No interference in China!" "Atomic war in China is world war".

The demonstration was organized by the Canadian Labor-Progressive Party. The demonstrators also distributed a statement issued by the Toronto City Committee of the Labor-Progressive Party to passers-by. The statement said, "We demand recognition of China and publicly declare our support for China's legitimate seat in the United Nations Security Council."

At the end of the parade, Sam Walsh, chairman of the Toronto City Committee of the Labor-Progressive Party, announced that a demonstration parade would be held again at noon on the 12th, and he called on more people to participate.

    罗马尼亚钢铁工业中心洪尼多阿拉的工人们17日纷纷举行车间集会，抗议美国对中国的挑衅行为。工人们在会上表示，他们要更好地进行劳动以加强祖国的威力。如果情况需要，他们将和苏联及其他社会主义阵营国家的人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民一起，给怙恶不悛的美国帝国主义以坚决的打击。
    最近几天来，雅西州的企业、机关、国营农场、机器拖拉机站有四万八千多人参加了抗议美国帝国主义挑衅行为的集会。在这些会议上，有两千二百多人讲了话。这个州的集体农民和个体农民也举行了六百次抗议集会，谴责美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势的行为。
    在斯大林州各地举行的许多抗议集会上，劳动人民一致认为，对中国人民的侵略，就是对罗马尼亚人民的侵略。他们表示坚决支援为正义事业而斗争的中国人民。
    据新华社地拉那17日电　阿尔巴尼亚各地人民连日来纷纷举行集会，抗议美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区的挑衅行为，支持中国人民的正义斗争。
    发罗那列宁水泥厂的工人海巴在工厂集会上的讲话中指出，帝国主义者和他的仆从们应该知道，乘一艘军舰开往太平洋就可以奴役整个亚洲的时代早已经过去了。今天我们是生活在社会主义时代。如果他们胆敢发动对中国的进攻，那就一定会遭到毁灭。
    马克思水力发电厂的工人们在集会上说，帝国主义应当明白，触犯中国就等于触犯整个的拥有九亿人口的社会主义阵营，它能够随时给每一个侵略者以应得的打击。
    地拉那纺织合作社的工人在集会上通过了一项支持兄弟般的中国人民的决议。

    主持集会的印度亚非团结委员会主席尼赫鲁夫人说，台湾问题是“中国的内政，美国没有理由进行干涉。中国要求把台湾同大陆合并是一种正当的要求，正像我们要求归并果阿来完成我们自己的独立一样。”
    著名的印度经济学家吉安·昌德在集会上说，美国干涉台湾是向觉醒了的亚洲力量进行挑战。印度人民发出支持中国人民的呼声，是向西方国家表示：“亚洲的复兴运动将继续下去，印度人民将投入其中，加速它的实现。”他说：“印度人民表明，我们同未来的力量站在一起。”他的这番话引起了到会者的欢呼。
    共产党议员希伦·慕克吉谴责美国在远东的无耻的挑衅行为，他说，帝国主义者在西亚遭到失败以后，又企图在远东惹起风波。“美国希望殖民主义东山再起，但是亚洲人民决不能容忍。台湾早在哥伦布发现美洲以前就属于中国。”他说，印度各地都发出了这样的呼声：“停止干涉中国，美国滚出中国领海，恢复中国在台湾的主权，恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位。”
    集会通过了国大党议员、印度亚非团结委员会秘书戈文达·雷迪提出的一项谴责美国在台湾地区集结军事力量的决议。决议指出，台湾和沿海岛屿属于中华人民共和国，中华人民共和国完全有权解放这些岛屿。决议最后表示希望中美会谈将“在承认中国人民的正当权利的基础上”获得成功。
