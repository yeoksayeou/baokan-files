Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 21st: Workers, peasants, students, and people from all walks of life in Shanghai gathered today to support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement. Enraged by the constant war provocations of US imperialism, the people of Shanghai resolutely declared: We will fight to the end, sparing no sacrifice, for the sacred cause of resisting aggression and safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our motherland.

The workers of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, who are working day and night to produce 1.2 million tons of steel for the city annually, held meetings today beside the steel furnaces and on the construction sites of new plants to express their determination. Hundreds of workers in the new, huge converter workshop, which is about to produce steel, raised their fists and swore to the Party and the motherland: We are good sons and daughters of the motherland, builders of the motherland, and defenders of the motherland. If the motherland needs steel, we have steel; if it needs people, we will lay down our tools and pick up guns to fight to the end to defend the socialist construction and communist cause of our motherland! The young men and women of the Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Mill have recently formed a Youth Guard. Today, after seeing Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, they were very excited and expressed their determination to intensify their training and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, pick up their guns and rush to the front lines. Young worker Lü Xindu said: US imperialism has threatened our peaceful life, and Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement represents our will. The monument to the martyr Gu Zhenghong, who sacrificed himself in the "May 30th" incident, is in our factory. It is absolutely impossible for US imperialism to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism, using Kinmen and Matsu as springboards to invade our country. If they dare to impose war on the Chinese people, we will thoroughly eliminate the American aggressors, just as we eliminated Japanese imperialism.

The suburban farmers, who are in the midst of a full-scale people's commune upsurge, were filled with righteous indignation after hearing Foreign Minister Chen Yi's solemn statement on the radio. At the founding meeting of the city's first people's commune, the "July 1st" People's Commune, attended by more than 10,000 people, people angrily protested against US imperialism's aggression against our country. The militiamen raised their guns to show their determination to defend the motherland.

The teachers and students of Shanghai's universities and colleges, which have fully implemented militarization, are determined to strengthen their military training. The students of the East China Normal University's militia steel column braved the rain today to build a shooting range, determined to work day and night to complete it ahead of schedule. The students of Class 3, Grade 3 of the History Department stated: "In order to defend the motherland, we are determined to strengthen our military training and ensure that the entire class reaches the level of ordinary sharpshooters before National Day." The scientific workers of various institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai formally established the Shanghai Science Militia Division, and the head of the Shanghai Military Service Bureau awarded the division flag and rifles. This morning, researchers from various institutes gathered in the rain for drills.

The women of the Caoyang Village Residents Committee read the newspaper while making new shoes. They will make a thousand pairs of new shoes within ten days to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Kinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan. As soon as the newspaper reader finished reading Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, Wang A'mei, a retired female worker from the Shanghai No. 1 Silk Spinning Factory, said: The American robbers are occupying our country's territory, but now they are biting back. It's too hateful. It won't do unless we give them a good beating. I have already written to my son, who is fighting on the Fujian front, telling him to severely strike the invaders. Now we have organized a militia team of 180 people, and more than 100 people have joined the Red Cross to learn hygiene knowledge. Although I am already 57 years old, I have a young heart. I can't take up a gun to kill the enemy, but I can do a good job in the neighborhood and motivate my sisters. If necessary, I can also go to the front line to work as a communications person or cook."

Jin Zhonghua and Li Zhaohuan, Vice Chairmen of the Shanghai Municipal CPPCC, Zhao Zukang, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Chen Wangdao, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, Hu Juewen, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal CPPCC and Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Wu Ruo'an, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Xie Xuetang, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, and famous writer Ba Jin unanimously supported Foreign Minister Chen Yi's refutation of Dulles' statement. Chen Wangdao said: Dulles' absurd remarks of September 18 on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region completely repeated Eisenhower's and his own nonsense. It's truly absurd to the extreme. In order to cover up the United States' aggressive activities against our country, Dulles even falsely accused our country of being an "aggressor" and proposed so-called "ceasefire." There is no war between China and the United States, so how can we talk about a "ceasefire"? To eliminate the tension in the Taiwan Strait region, the US military must get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait region.

    上海人民正告战争狂人
    如果谁敢于把战争强加在中国人民身上
    我们就像消灭日本帝国主义一样消灭它
    新华社上海21日电　上海市工人、农民、学生和各界人士今天纷纷集会，拥护陈毅外交部长的声明。被美帝国主义不断的战争挑衅激怒了的上海人民坚决表示：不惜一切牺牲为反抗侵略，为维护祖国主权和领土完整的神圣事业而战斗到底。
    正在为全市年产一百二十万吨钢而日夜战斗着的上海第三钢铁厂职工，今天在炼钢炉旁和新建厂房工地上集会表示决心。日内就要出钢的新建巨大转炉车间的几百个工人举起拳头向党向祖国宣誓：我们是祖国的好儿女，是祖国的建设者，也是祖国的保卫者。祖国要钢，我们有钢，要人，我们就放下工具拿起枪，为保卫祖国的社会主义建设事业和共产主义事业而奋斗到底！上海国棉二厂的男女青年们，最近已成立了青年近卫军。今天，他们看到陈毅外交部长的声明后，十分振奋，表示要加紧锻炼，随时准备响应祖国召唤，拿起枪杆奔赴前线。青年工人吕新度说：美帝国主义威胁了我们的和平生活，陈毅外交部长的声明代表了我们的意志。“五卅”牺牲的烈士顾正红的纪念碑就在我们厂里，美帝国主义要走日本帝国主义的老路，以金门、马祖作为跳板来侵略我国，是万万不行的。如果他们敢于把战争强加在中国人民身上，我们要像消灭日本帝国主义一样，彻底消灭美国侵略者。
    正处在全面人民公社化高潮中的市郊农民们在有线广播中听到陈毅外交部长的严正声明后，群情激愤，有一万多人参加的市郊第一个人民公社——“七一”人民公社成立大会上，人们都愤怒地抗议美帝国主义对我国的侵略。民兵们高举枪杆表示了保卫祖国的决心。
    已经全面实行军事化的上海各高等学校师生们，决心加强军事训练。华东师大民兵钢铁纵队的同学们，今天冒雨修建打靶场，决心日夜突击，提前完成。历史系三年级三班同学表示：“为了保卫祖国，我们决心加强军事训练，保证国庆节前全班达到普通射手水平。”中国科学院上海各研究所的科学工作者今天正式成立上海科学民兵师，由上海市兵役局负责人授予师旗和步枪。今天清晨各所研究工作者冒雨集合操练。
    曹杨村居民委员会的妇女们一面读报，一面做新鞋，他们要在十天内做出一千双新鞋，支援解放军解放金门、马祖，解放台湾。读报员刚把陈毅外长的声明读完，上海第一绢纺厂退休女工王阿妹说：美国强盗们霸占着我国的领土，现在却反咬一口，太可恨了。不狠狠地揍他一顿是不行的。我已经写信告诉在福建前线作战的儿子，叫他狠狠地打击侵略者。现在我们组织了一百八十人的民兵队伍，一百多个人参加了红十字会学习卫生知识，我虽然已经五十七岁了，可是我有一颗年青的心，我不能拿枪杀敌，但是我可以把里弄工作搞好，把姊妹们带动起来。必要时我也可以上前线作通讯、烧饭工作。”
    上海市政协副主席金仲华、黎照寰、民革上海市委主委赵祖康、民盟上海市委主委陈望道、上海市政协副主席、民建上海市委副主委胡厥文、民进上海市委主委吴若安、台盟上海市支部主任谢雪堂、著名作家巴金等一致拥护陈毅外交部长驳斥杜勒斯的声明。陈望道说：杜勒斯9月18日所发表的关于台湾海峡地区局势的谬论，完全重复了艾森豪威尔和他自己的胡言谰语，真是荒谬到了极点，杜勒斯为了掩盖美国对我国的侵略活动，竟反诬我国为“侵略者”，并提出所谓“停火”，中美之间没有打仗，何从谈到“停火”，消除台湾海峡地区的紧张局势，是美军从台湾和台湾海峡地区滚出去。
