Folk Tale

    Deep Plowing Brings Forth "Gold"
    In the past, there was an old man named Zhao who lived with his two sons. Before he died, the old man called his two sons to his side and said, "I won't live much longer. There's a jar of gold buried in our one *mu* of land, buried about two *chi* deep." After saying that, the old man died. The two Zhao brothers, following their father's words, dug three *chi* deep from the south end of the land to the north end, but couldn't find any gold. Frustrated, the brothers planted wheat on the land, but this one *mu* of land yielded more than 6,000 *jin* of wheat, an increase of seven or eight times compared to the past. Only then did the brothers realize that deep plowing could indeed produce "gold."

    深翻地出“金子”
    过去有个老赵头领着两个儿子过日子，老头临死前把两个儿子叫到身前说：“我活不长了，咱家有一罐金子埋在咱们那一亩地里，埋有二尺多深。”说完老头就死了。老赵家这哥俩根据老头的话，从地南头到地北头，挖了三尺多深，也没挖出金子来。哥俩窝着火把这地种上了小麦，可是这一亩地就打了六千多斤麦子，比过去提高七、八倍。这时哥俩才醒悟了，都说：深翻地真能出“金子”。
