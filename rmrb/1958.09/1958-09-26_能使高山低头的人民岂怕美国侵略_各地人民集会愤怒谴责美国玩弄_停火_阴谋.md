Xinhua News Agency, September 25th - The United States is playing with a "ceasefire" conspiracy by using the Sino-US talks in Warsaw, and using this as a cover to step up its war preparations against our country, which is increasingly arousing the anger of the Chinese people. In recent days, rallies have been held in various places to resolutely support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, expressing that no conspiracy of the American aggressors will be allowed to succeed.

At the rallies, people from all over the country unanimously pointed out that the "ceasefire" conspiracy played by the American aggressors can neither deceive the world's fair-minded public opinion nor the great Chinese people. Yu Yanong, Director of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have become a great nation that cannot be intimidated or deceived. American imperialism cannot intimidate the Chinese people with atomic weapons, and it cannot deceive the Chinese people by conspiring to create "two Chinas" through the so-called "ceasefire." Since we have the great spirit to "make high mountains bow and rivers give way" in the struggle against nature, we certainly have enough strength to liberate our own territory and resist aggression. Wang Guiying, Chairman of the Trade Union of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and National Model Worker, said that our liberation of Jinmen, Mazu and Taiwan has nothing to do with American imperialism, but the United States wants us to "ceasefire." We want to warn the American aggressors: any conspiracy you play is futile. Gao Kai, a 61-year-old librarian at the Fujian Provincial Research Institute of Culture and History, said: "I was the commissioner of the Fourth Administrative Inspectorate of Fujian Province of the former Kuomintang (that is, most of the area under the jurisdiction of the present Jinjiang Special Zone). At that time, Jinmen was the area under my jurisdiction. In recent years, if it were not for the protection of American imperialism, the coastal islands of Fujian occupied by the Chiang gang would have been liberated long ago, and Taiwan, our territory, would have been liberated long ago. The 'ceasefire' conspiracy played by the American aggressors is to prevent the Chinese people from recovering their own territory, so that it can follow in the footsteps of Japanese militarism to achieve the goal of aggression against China. The Chinese people will never let the American aggressors' conspiracy succeed."

The persons in charge of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, the Youth Federation, the Student Federation, and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League all unanimously pointed out in their talks with reporters from Shanghai newspapers that there is no war between China and the United States, and there is no question of a "ceasefire." The tense situation in the Taiwan region is entirely caused by the military provocations of American imperialism against our country. The American aggressors are clamoring for a "ceasefire" in an attempt to obstruct our country from exercising its sovereignty on its own territory, so as to legalize its occupation of Taiwan, our territory, and further expand the scope of aggression to the islands in our inland sea. They also pointed out that liberating Jinmen, Mazu and liberating Taiwan, and realizing the reunification of the motherland, is the sacred right that the Chinese people will never and absolutely abandon. We do not want an inch of land from other countries, nor will we allow other countries to occupy an inch of our land.

People from all over the country also unanimously pointed out that the current problem is not about "ceasefire," but about the American aggressors immediately stopping arson. Chen Yuan, President of Beijing Normal University, published an article in the "Beijing Daily" saying that the American aggressors, ignoring the repeated warnings of the Chinese people, continue to send their warships into our territorial waters for provocations during the Warsaw talks. We want to warn the American aggressors that the era when the imperialists opened a warship in the Chinese port and the scum of the Chinese people, the traitors of the nation, succumbed, surrendered, signed treaties and paid indemnities, like before liberation, is gone forever. The 600 million Chinese people have already taken control of their own destiny. United under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we have enough strength to defend our motherland and defeat the aggressors. He also said that Eisenhower refused the renewed admonition of Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev and returned the letter to Moscow. His doing so will not erase the facts stated in the letter, nor will it stop the just condemnation of the people all over the world. Wu Xinmin and Jiang Dasan, people's heroes from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhengzhou, said at a local rally that American imperialism is clamoring for a "ceasefire" on the one hand, and stepping up its war preparations in the Taiwan Strait on the other hand, which cannot but make people doubt the sincerity of the United States in the Sino-US talks. We must firmly grasp the weapons in our hands and be ready to give the aggressors a devastating blow at any time.

At present, the people all over the country are closely watching the development of the Sino-US talks in Warsaw and the situation in the Taiwan Strait with high vigilance.

### 能使高山低头的人民岂怕美国侵略  各地人民集会愤怒谴责美国玩弄“停火”阴谋

    能使高山低头的人民岂怕美国侵略
    各地人民集会愤怒谴责美国玩弄“停火”阴谋
    新华社25日讯  美国利用华沙中美会谈玩弄“停火”阴谋，并以此作为掩护，加紧对我国进行备战活动，愈来愈激起全中国人民的愤怒。连日来，各地都举行集会，坚决拥护陈毅外长的声明，表示决不容许美国侵略者的任何阴谋得逞。
    各地人民在集会上都一致指出，美国侵略者所玩弄的“停火”阴谋，既欺骗不了世界公正舆论，更欺骗不了伟大的中国人民。民革安徽省委主任委员余亚农说，中国人民在中国共产党领导下，已经成为一个吓不倒也骗不了的伟大民族。美帝国主义以原子武器固然吓不倒中国人民，而想以所谓“停火”来阴谋制造“两个中国”，更是欺骗不了中国人民。我们既然有力量要“高山低头、河水让路”的对大自然斗争的伟大气魄，当然也有足够力量来解放自己的领土和反抗侵略。太原钢铁公司工会主席、全国劳动模范王贵英说，我们解放金门、马祖和台湾，同美帝国主义没有一点关系，而美国却要我们“停火”，我们要警告美国侵略者：你们玩弄的任何阴谋都是徒劳的。福建省文史研究馆六十一岁的馆员高垲说：“我是前国民党福建省第四专员公署（即现在晋江专区所属的大部分地区）的专员，那时金门就是我管辖的地区。这几年来，如果不是美帝国主义庇护，蒋帮所盘踞的福建沿海岛屿早就解放了，我国的领土台湾也早就解放了。美国侵略者玩弄的‘停火’阴谋，就是要中国人民不去收复自己的领土，以便它步日本军国主义的后尘，达到侵略中国的目的。中国人民决不会让美国侵略者的阴谋得逞的”。
    上海市工会联合会、妇女联合会、青年联合会、学生联合会和共青团上海市委的负责人在对上海各报记者发表的谈话中，也都一致指出，中国同美国之间没有打仗，根本谈不上“停火”问题。台湾地区的紧张局势，完全是因为美帝国主义对我国进行军事挑衅所造成的。美国侵略者叫嚷“停火”，是企图以此来阻挠我国在自己的领土上行使主权，而让它侵占我国领土台湾成为合法化，进一步把侵略范围扩大到我国的内海岛屿。他们还指出，解放金门、马祖和解放台湾，实现祖国的统一，这是中国人民永远和绝对不会放弃的神圣权利。我们不要别国一寸土地，也决不允许别国侵占我们一寸土地。
    各地人民还一致指出，当前的问题根本不在于什么“停火”，而是要美国侵略者立即停止放火行为。北京师范大学校长陈垣在“北京日报”上发表文章说，美国侵略者不顾中国人民的一再警告，在华沙会谈期间仍继续不断派遣它的军舰侵入我国领海进行挑衅。我们要警告美国侵略者，像解放以前那样，帝国主义一条军舰开在中国海口，中国人民的败类、民族的叛徒就屈膝投降、订约赔款的时代，已经一去不复返了。六亿中国人民已经自己掌握了自己的命运，我们在中国共产党领导下团结一致，有足够的力量保卫我们的祖国，战胜侵略者。他还说，艾森豪威尔拒绝苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的再次告诫，把信件退回莫斯科，他这样做丝毫也抹杀不了信上所说的事实，也丝毫阻挡不了全世界人民的正义谴责。人民解放军驻郑州部队某部人民功臣吴新民、江达三等人在当地举行的集会上说，美帝国主义一面叫嚣“停火”，一面在台湾海峡加紧备战活动，这不能不令人怀疑美国对中美会谈的诚意。我们一定紧握手中的武器，随时准备给予侵略者以毁灭性的打击。
    目前，全国各地人民都在以高度的警惕，密切注视着华沙中美会谈和台湾海峡局势的发展。
