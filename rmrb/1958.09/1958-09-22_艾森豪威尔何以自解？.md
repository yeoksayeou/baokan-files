Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev wrote to US President Eisenhower again on the 19th regarding the situation in the Taiwan area. The US President actually adopted an extraordinary attitude, writing the word "rejected" on the letter, returning it to Moscow, and successively issuing two statements defending the United States' aggressive crimes. The White House statement once again falsely accused our people's action of liberating their own territory and exercising sacred sovereignty as "aggression," saying that "the Chinese Communist regime is trying to seize by force territory over which it has never exercised power." On the contrary, it described the United States' aggression as a "peaceful action" of "cooperation with a friendly country's government purely for defense." It is not difficult for people to understand why Eisenhower is so angry and rude; it turns out that Comrade Khrushchev's letter hit the US authorities where it hurts. In his letter, the Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers exposed the aggressive face of the United States before world opinion, and at the same time sternly warned the American warmongers that if they used atomic and hydrogen weapons against China, they would inevitably be met with a corresponding counterattack immediately. The American aggressors once again showed their true colors before the people of the world, and the policy of atomic blackmail went bankrupt once again. This is the reason why Eisenhower flew into a rage and became furious.

In his letter, Khrushchev pointed out that the only real reason for the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait area is that the United States has occupied Taiwan, a territory that has belonged to China since ancient times, and that the United States wants to make Taiwan and other coastal islands a base for expanding aggression against the People's Republic of China and other peace-loving countries in Asia. The United States has rudely interfered in China's internal affairs and attempted to establish its own system in other countries by force, thereby posing a serious threat to peace in the Far East.

Faced with the facts presented by Khrushchev, what defense can Eisenhower make? None! Eisenhower dared not mention the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Declaration, both of which confirmed that Taiwan is Chinese territory. Eisenhower also dared not mention the statement made by his predecessor Truman on January 5, 1950. At that time, President Truman announced to the world: Taiwan is Chinese territory. "The United States has no predatory ambitions regarding Taiwan or other Chinese territories... The United States also does not intend to use armed forces to intervene in the current situation, and the United States government does not intend to follow any path that would involve the United States in China's internal strife." Because the fact is: nine years ago, shortly after Truman issued the above statement, the United States forcibly occupied our territory of Taiwan, violated the Cairo Declaration, violated the Potsdam Declaration, and also violated the promises of the US President himself. The United States not only has "predatory ambitions" for Taiwan, but has already implemented armed occupation. The United States has not only used armed forces to interfere in China's internal affairs, but has already embarked on the path of "involving itself in China's internal strife."

Isn't it clear that the United States has committed aggression against China? Eisenhower says "the United States is purely for defense." Is there such a thing as "defense" in the world? Can any country send its armed forces to a foreign country to occupy its territory for "defense"? The crimes of the American aggressors cannot be washed away even by emptying the Pacific Ocean. People know that the United States, while occupying our territory of Taiwan, also launched a war of aggression in Korea. The American aggressors attacked from both the north and the south, vainly attempting to encircle and attack the Chinese mainland. This is completely imitating the old trick of Japanese imperialism. Japanese imperialism first occupied Korea and Taiwan in China, and then launched the "September 18th" incident, occupying the three northeastern provinces of our country, and then launched the "July 7th" incident, occupying half of the Chinese mainland. The arrogant plan of Japanese imperialism was to conquer China and then encompass East Asia. Our people still remember this vividly. US imperialism is now following the old path of Japanese imperialism's aggression against China. The American General MacArthur once publicly said: The United States believes that Taiwan is the "hub" of the Pacific front and an "unsinkable aircraft carrier"; the United States must control Taiwan so that the United States can "control every Asian seaport from Vladivostok to Singapore with its air force." Isn't this using Taiwan as a base to invade China and other Asian countries?

After the failure of US imperialism's plan to conquer Korea and then advance into Northeast China under the joint resistance of the Chinese and Korean people, it did not abandon its ambition to conquer China. On the contrary, it stepped up its military deployment in Taiwan and the coastal islands. It was precisely after the Korean armistice that the United States continuously increased the military equipment of the Chiang Kai-shek group, and drove the Chiang Kai-shek group to concentrate one-third of its entire force on the coastal islands such as Jinmen and Matsu, using the coastal islands as a springboard for launching attacks on the Chinese mainland. It is precisely for this reason that the Chiang army entrenched in Jinmen and Matsu has been constantly harassing the mainland for several years, attacking Chinese merchant ships and fishing boats traveling to and from the coast, and dispatching a large number of armed agents to the mainland from there. American generals and the Chiang Kai-shek group have repeatedly publicly announced that one day they will launch an attack on the mainland from there. The conspiracy of US imperialism to conquer China can also be confirmed by the memorandum recently issued by the US State Department. The memorandum states: "The United States continues to recognize and support the Republic of China, which enables it to oppose the Chinese Communists' claim to represent the Chinese people, and enables those Chinese who are determined to finally liberate their country from Communist rule to continue to harbor hope." The US State Department does not conceal its intention to "accelerate the 'disappearance process' of Communist rule in China 'by not giving diplomatic recognition to Peiping'." All of these are things that Eisenhower cannot deny. The crimes of American aggression can never be exonerated by the flowery words of the American gentlemen.

The American jackals always want to put on a sheep's skin, as if Chiang Kai-shek's "Republic of China government" can become their shield. Khrushchev pointed out in his letter that Chiang Kai-shek is nothing more than a hateful ghost to the 600 million Chinese people. There is only one government in China - the government of the People's Republic of China. The "joint defense treaty" that the United States uses as an excuse for the obligations it has undertaken to Chiang Kai-shek is merely a treaty imagined and fabricated to cover up aggression. Faced with this accusation from Khrushchev, what defense can Eisenhower make? Neither can he!

Indeed, the Chiang Kai-shek clique once implemented more than 20 years of dark rule in China. However, this corrupt and decadent small dynasty of the four major families, although cultivated by US imperialism, was overthrown by the Chinese people as early as nine years ago. The remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek clique fled to Taiwan, and if they had not been protected by the United States, they would have been wiped out long ago. The United States is now clinging to its so-called "joint defense treaty" with Chiang Kai-shek as a talisman for its occupation of Chinese territory Taiwan and its expansion of aggression against the Chinese mainland. As everyone knows, this "treaty" is nothing more than a deed of sale for Chiang Kai-shek, a dead soul. The Chinese people have long declared this "treaty" to be illegal and invalid. There have been many national traitors in history who have signed all kinds of treasonous treaties with foreign masters. In our modern history, there have been Pu Yi and Wang Jingwei, who signed treasonous treaties with Japanese imperialism. But does this prove that Japan's aggression against China was legal? Does this exonerate Japan from the crime of aggression against China? During World War II, Petain of France and Quisling of Norway also signed treasonous treaties with Hitler. But does this prove that Hitler's occupation of France and Norway was legal? Does this exonerate Hitler's Germany from the crime of aggression? As a result of World War II, the aggressive crimes of both Japanese imperialism and German fascism were punished as they deserved. The "treaties" signed by Pu Yi, Wang Jingwei, Petain, and Quisling could not become their talisman in the slightest. For US imperialism, which is now occupying China's territory of Taiwan, how can Chiang Kai-shek's deed of sale save it from being hanged?

The gentlemen in Washington often say grandiosely that Taiwan, Jinmen, and Matsu are "territories over which the 'Chinese Communist regime' has 'never exercised power'." It seems that this can constitute a reason for the United States to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating these territories of their own, and it seems that this can constitute a reason for the United States to occupy these Chinese territories. By extension, it seems that this can also constitute a reason for the United States to attack the Chinese mainland one day. Because according to this robber logic of the United States, the People's Republic of China did not exist ten years ago. There was only something called the "Republic of China." Of course, it can also be considered that the Chinese mainland is "territory over which the 'Chinese Communist regime' has 'never exercised power'." Of course, it can also "help" Chiang Kai-shek, this dead soul, "recover lost ground." If this robber logic of the gentlemen in Washington can be established, people can boldly ask the United States that the American independence in the 18th century was illegal and was an invasion of Britain, because the American pioneer Washington forcibly seized the territory of the British Empire over which he had never exercised power. Similarly, the United States can send its armed forces to any country at any time, because the current government of any country has not exercised power on its territory a hundred, a thousand, let alone ten thousand years ago. Of course, if someone really raised this question, people would regard him as a madman. But the great gentlemen of the United States are exactly such madmen.

In his letter, Comrade Khrushchev also exposed the US atomic blackmail, which has exacerbated the danger of an outbreak of a modern war using the most destructive weapons. At the same time, Comrade Khrushchev issued a solemn warning to the United States: If the United States dares to launch such an attack on the People's Republic of China, then the aggressor will immediately be met with a corresponding counterattack with similar weapons. Faced with this accusation and warning, how can Eisenhower exonerate himself? Eisenhower reversed right and wrong, saying that "the Soviet Union, this military autocracy, actually supports the use of force to achieve expansionist goals," saying that the Soviet Union is conducting "intolerable threats." People are probably not going to regard Eisenhower as the former US Secretary of Defense Forrestal. This Forrestal once suffered a nervous breakdown due to war mania. One day, he mistakenly thought that the Soviet Union was launching an atomic attack on New York and jumped out of a building to escape, and as a result, he fell to his death under a skyscraper. However, Eisenhower is now seeing ghosts in broad daylight like Forrestal. Is it the American "Nike" missiles, "Matador" missiles, and a large number of ships and aircraft carrying nuclear bombs that have been transferred to the Taiwan area that are threatening China, or is it the Soviet Union that "has carried out intolerable threats" by issuing a written warning about the dangerous actions of the United States in conducting atomic weapons threats? The people of the world are not idiots and fools! Today, the one threatening China, threatening peace in the Far East and the world, is none other than the US armed forces that have been mobilized from 10,000 kilometers away to Chinese territory and territorial waters.

Eisenhower portrayed himself as a "humiliated and harmed" person, as if the United States is now "threatened." Therefore, the resumed meetings between China and the United States in Warsaw are "difficult to negotiate under the current threats from the Soviet Union." Eisenhower's words seem to give people the impression that the United States originally had sincere intentions for the Warsaw talks. However, judging from the existing situation, we do not know where the sincerity of the United States lies. Just after the resumption of the Warsaw ambassador-level talks, the United States expanded its provocative activities in the Taiwan Strait area and stepped up its deployment for nuclear war. It has not only escorted Chiang's naval vessels to Jinmen, but also threatened to send aircraft to bomb the mainland. Dulles shamelessly slandered the Chinese people's desire to liberate their own territory as "armed aggression" and coerced China to cease fire. May I ask, from which point can it be seen that the United States has any sincerity in the negotiations? Under this kind of military threat and war provocation by the United States, what will be the result of the negotiations? If the United States is really sincere about the Sino-US talks, it must prove it with actions rather than words. First of all, it must immediately stop military provocations and threats of war, and immediately withdraw US armed forces from the Taiwan area. Everything else is nonsense.

### 艾森豪威尔何以自解？

    艾森豪威尔何以自解？
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫19日就台湾地区局势问题再一次写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔。美国总统竟然采取了异乎寻常的态度，在这封信上批上“拒绝”两个大字，退回莫斯科，并且接连发表了两个声明，为美国的侵略罪行辩解。白宫的声明再一次把我国人民解放自己领土的行使神圣主权的行动诬蔑为“侵略”，说什么“中国共产党政权努力用武力夺取它从来没有行使过权力的领土”，反而把美国的侵略说成是“纯粹为了防御而同一个友好国家政府进行合作”的“和平行动”。人们不难理解，艾森豪威尔这样恼怒和粗暴，原来是赫鲁晓夫同志的信击中了美国当局的痛处。苏联部长会议主席在信中在全世界舆论面前揭露了美国的侵略面目，同时又严正地警告了美国战争狂人，如果他们对中国使用原子武器和氢武器，势必立即遭到相应的反击。美国侵略者在全世界人民面前又一次亮了相，原子讹诈政策又一次破了产，这就是艾森豪威尔暴跳如雷、老羞成怒的缘由。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中指出，台湾海峡地区形成紧张局势的唯一真正原因，是美国侵占了自古以来就是属于中国的领土的台湾，美国要使台湾和其他沿海岛屿成为对中华人民共和国和亚洲其他爱好和平国家扩大侵略的基地。美国粗鲁地干涉了中国内政，并且企图用武力在别国建立自己的制度，从而对远东和平造成严重的威胁。
    面对着赫鲁晓夫提出的事实，艾森豪威尔能作些什么辩解呢？不能！艾森豪威尔不敢提到1943年的开罗宣言和1945年的波茨坦宣言，这两个宣言都确认台湾是中国的领土。艾森豪威尔也不敢提到他的前任杜鲁门在1950年1月5日的声明。当时身任美国总统的杜鲁门向全世界宣布：台湾是属于中国的领土。“美国对台湾或中国其他领土从无掠夺的野心……美国亦不拟使用武装部队干预其现在的局势，美国政府不拟循任何足以把美国卷入中国内争的途径”。因为事实是：九年以前，就在杜鲁门发表上述的声明之后不久，美国就武力占领了我国的领土台湾，破坏了开罗宣言，破坏波茨坦宣言，也违背了美国总统自己的诺言。美国对台湾不仅有“掠夺的野心”，而且已经实行了武装占领。美国对中国内政不仅使用了武装部队进行干预，而且已经走上了“卷入中国内争”的道路。
    美国对中国进行了侵略，这不是明明白白的吗？艾森豪威尔说“美国纯粹为了防御”，世界上难道有这样的“防御”吗？难道任何一个国家都可以派遣自己的武装力量到外国去占领别国的领土来“防御”吗？美国的侵略者的罪名是倾太平洋之水也洗不掉的。人们知道，美国在侵占我国领土台湾的同时，还在朝鲜发动了侵略战争。美国侵略者南北双管齐下，妄想钳击中国大陆。这完全是效法日本帝国主义的故技。日本帝国主义就是先占领了朝鲜和中国的台湾，然后进一步发动了“九一八”事件，侵占了我国东北三省，接着又发动了“七七事变”，侵占了半个中国大陆。日本帝国主义的狂妄计划是在征服了中国之后，就进而囊括东亚。我国人民记忆犹新。美帝国主义现在走的是日本帝国主义侵略中国的老路。美国的将军麦克阿瑟就曾经公开说过：美国认为台湾是太平洋前线的“总枢纽”，是“不沉的航空母舰”；美国必须控制台湾，以便美国“用空军控制自海参崴到新加坡的每一亚洲的海港”。这难道不是要以台湾作为基地，侵略中国以及亚洲其他国家吗？
    美帝国主义征服朝鲜从而进兵我国东北的计划，在朝中人民的联合抗击下失败之后，并没有放弃征服中国的野心，恰恰相反，它加紧了在台湾和沿海岛屿的军事布置。正是在朝鲜停战以后，美国不断地增加了蒋介石集团的军事装备，并且驱使蒋介石集团把它的全部兵力的三分之一集结在金门、马祖等沿海岛屿上，把沿海岛屿作为向中国大陆发动进攻的跳板。正是因为这个缘故，盘据金门和马祖等地的蒋军，几年以来不断对大陆进行骚扰，袭击来往沿海我国商船和渔船，并且从那里派遣大批的武装特务到大陆来。美国的将军们和蒋介石集团都屡次公开宣布，有朝一日将从那里发动对大陆的进攻。美帝国主义妄图征服中国的阴谋，还可以从美国国务院不久前发表的备忘录中得到证实。备忘录说：“美国继续承认和支持中华民国，就使它能够反对中国共产党人自称代表中国人民的说法，并且使那些决心最后把他们的国家从共产党的统治下面解放出来的中国人继续怀抱希望”。美国国务院毫不掩饰“想通过不给北平外交上承认的作法”，来“加速共产主义在中国的统治”的“消失过程”。所有这些，是艾森豪威尔抵赖不了的。美国侵略的罪行，绝不是美国先生们的花言巧语所能解脱的。
    美国豺狼总想披上一张羊皮，似乎蒋介石的“中华民国政府”可以成为它的挡箭牌。赫鲁晓夫在信中指出，蒋介石对于中国六亿人民来说只不过是令人仇恨的幽灵而已。中国只有一个政府——中华人民共和国政府。美国借口对蒋介石承担的那种义务的那个“共同防御条约”，只不过是为了掩盖侵略而臆想出和编造出的一个条约。面对着赫鲁晓夫的这一指责，艾森豪威尔能作些什么辩解呢？也不能！
    不错，蒋介石集团曾经在中国实行二十多年暗无天日的黑色统治，但是，这一个腐朽透顶的四大家族的小朝廷，虽有美帝国主义大力栽培，早在九年以前就被中国人民推翻了。蒋介石集团的残兵败将逃到了台湾以后，要是没有美国的庇护，也早就被消灭了。美国现在死抱着它同蒋介石签订的所谓“共同防御条约”，作为它占领中国领土台湾和扩大对中国大陆侵略的护身符。尽人皆知，这个“条约”只不过是蒋介石这个死魂灵的卖身契而已，中国人民早就宣布这个“条约”是非法的、无效的。历史上有过不少的民族叛徒，他们同外国主子签订了各式各样的卖国条约。我国的近代历史上，有过溥仪和汪精卫，他们同日本帝国主义签订了卖国条约，但是，难道这就可以证明日本侵略中国是合法的吗？难道这就能解脱日本侵略中国的罪名吗？在第二次世界大战中，法国的贝当，挪威的吉斯林，也都曾同希特勒签订过卖国条约，但是，难道这就可以证明希特勒占领法国和挪威是合法的吗？难道这就可以解脱希特勒德国的侵略罪名吗？第二次世界大战的结果，无论是日本帝国主义或是德国法西斯，他们的侵略罪行都受到了应得的惩罚；溥仪、汪精卫、贝当、吉斯林同它们签订的“条约”，丝毫也不能成为它们的护身符。对于现在侵占中国领土台湾的美帝国主义来说，蒋介石的卖身契又怎能挽救它被处以绞刑呢？
    华盛顿的先生们常常振振有词，说什么台湾、金门、马祖，是“中国共产党政权”“从来没有行使过权力的领土”。似乎这就可以构成美国阻挠中国人民解放这些自己的领土的理由，似乎这也可以构成美国占领这些中国领土的理由。推而广之，似乎这也可以构成美国有朝一日进攻中国大陆的理由。因为根据美国这个强盗逻辑，中国在十年以前并不存在中华人民共和国，只有一个叫做什么“中华民国”，当然也可以认为中国大陆是“中国共产党政权”“从来没有行使过权力的领土”，当然也可以“帮助”蒋介石这个死魂灵“收复失地”了。如果华盛顿的先生们这一个强盗逻辑可以成立的话，人们大可以向美国提出，十八世纪美国的独立是非法的，是侵略了英国，因为美国的先驱者华盛顿武力夺取了他从来没有行使过权力的大英帝国的领土。同样，美国也可以在任何时候，把自己的武装部队派到任何国家去，因为任何一个国家的现在的政府，都不是在百年、千年更不用说万年以前就在它的领土上行使过权力的。当然，如果谁真的这样提出问题，人们会把他当作疯子。可是现在的美国的大人先生们却正是这样的疯子。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在信中还揭发了美国进行原子讹诈，加剧了爆发一场使用毁灭性最大的现代化战争的危险。同时，赫鲁晓夫同志向美国提出了严正的警告：美国如果竟然对中华人民共和国发动这种进攻，那末，侵略者就将立即遭到应有的、同类武器的反击。面对着这个指责和警告，艾森豪威尔何以自解？艾森豪威尔颠倒是非，说什么“苏联这个军事专制国竟然支持使用武力来达到扩张主义的目的”，说什么苏联进行“不能容忍的威胁”。人们大概不致于把艾森豪威尔当作是美国的前任国防部长福莱斯特尔。这个福莱斯特尔曾经因战争狂而神经错乱，有一天误以为苏联对纽约进行原子袭击而跳楼逃难，结果摔死在摩天大楼之下。但是，艾森豪威尔现在却活像福莱斯特尔那样白昼见鬼。究竟是调到台湾地区的美国“奈克式”导弹、“斗牛士式”导弹部队以及许许多多带有核弹的舰只飞机威胁了中国呢，还是对于美国疯狂进行原子武器威胁的危险行动提出书面警告的苏联“进行了不能容忍的威胁”呢？全世界人民并不是白痴和傻瓜！今天威胁中国、威胁远东和世界和平的，不是别人，而是从一万公里以外调集到中国领土、领海上来的美国武装部队。
    艾森豪威尔把自己装成“被侮辱和被损害的”人，好像美国现在受到了“威胁”，因此，中美两国在华沙恢复的会议，“在苏联目前进行的这种威胁下很难进行谈判”。艾森豪威尔的这些话似乎要给人们这样的印象，即美国对于华沙会谈本来真的抱有诚意。但是，从已有的情况看来，我们不知道美国的诚意在哪里。就在华沙大使级会谈恢复以后，美国扩大了在台湾海峡地区的挑衅活动，加紧了进行核战争的部署，不仅已经为蒋军舰只护航到金门，并且扬言要派飞机轰炸大陆。杜勒斯又无耻地诬蔑中国人民要解放自己的领土是“武装侵略”，而胁迫中国停火。试问，从哪一点上可以看出美国对谈判有一点诚意呢？在美国这种军事威胁和战争挑衅之下，谈判又会有什么结果呢？如果美国真的对中美会谈抱有诚意，那就必须以行动而不是言词来证实，首先就是必须立即停止军事挑衅和战争威胁，立即把美国武装部队撤出台湾地区。除此以外，都是废话。
