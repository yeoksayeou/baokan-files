Xinhua News Agency, 6th – Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area on September 6, 1958:

On September 4, 1958, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, authorized by U.S. President Eisenhower, issued a statement openly threatening to expand the scope of aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan Strait area and engage in war provocations, thereby exacerbating the tensions created by the United States in the region and seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. To this end, I am authorized to issue the following statement on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China:

I. Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. After World War II, they were returned to China after being occupied by Japan. It is entirely China's internal affair for the Chinese people to exercise their sovereignty to liberate these areas. This is the sacred and inviolable right of the Chinese people. The U.S. government itself once formally stated that it would not get involved in China's internal strife in the Taiwan area. If it were not for the U.S. government's subsequent abandonment of its statement and armed intervention, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands would have been liberated long ago and would have been under the jurisdiction of the Government of the People's Republic of China. This is an undeniable fact unanimously recognized by all fair-minded public opinion in the world.

II. The United States supports the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has long been abandoned by the entire Chinese people and entrenched in Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and directly occupies Taiwan and the Penghu Islands by force. This is an illegal act of interfering in China's internal affairs, infringing on China's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and directly conflicts with the UN Charter and all norms of international law. Any so-called treaty signed between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique and any relevant resolutions passed by the U.S. Congress are completely invalid for the Chinese people. They can never legitimize the U.S. aggression, let alone become an excuse for the United States to expand its scope of aggression in the Taiwan Strait area.

III. With the support of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has long used the coastal islands of Jinmen (Quemoy) and Mazu (Matsu), which are close to Xiamen and Fuzhou respectively, as forward outposts to carry out various harassment and sabotage activities against the Chinese mainland. Recently, after the United States launched armed intervention in Arab countries, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's harassment and sabotage against the Chinese mainland have become even more rampant. The Chinese government is fully entitled to resolutely strike at the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on the coastal islands and take necessary military actions. Any foreign interference is a criminal act of infringing upon China's sovereignty. However, in order to divert world attention from the United States' continued aggression in the Middle East and its delaying of the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon, the United States is attempting to take advantage of this situation to amass armed forces in the Taiwan Strait area and openly threaten to expand its scope of aggression in the Taiwan Strait area to coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu. This is a serious war provocation against the 600 million Chinese people and a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world.

IV. The determination of the Chinese people to liberate their territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands is unshakable. The Chinese people especially cannot tolerate the direct threat posed by coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu in their own inland sea. No war provocation by the United States can frighten the Chinese people. On the contrary, it will only arouse greater anger and a stronger determination among the 600 million people to fight the American aggressors to the end. The U.S. invading forces in Lebanon have not yet withdrawn, and now they are creating new war dangers in the Taiwan Strait area. This makes peace-loving countries and people all over the world even more aware of the barbaric face of the American aggressors who deliberately undermine peace, and even more aware that American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of all national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the world peace movement.

V. The Chinese government, in accordance with its peaceful foreign policy, has consistently advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems based on the Five Principles, and the settlement of all international disputes through peaceful negotiations. Despite the fact that the United States has occupied China's Taiwan and Penghu Islands by force, and has grossly undermined the most basic norms of international relations, the Chinese government has still proposed to sit down and negotiate with the U.S. government to seek the easing and elimination of tensions in the Taiwan area. In the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks that began in August 1955, the Chinese side repeatedly suggested that both sides issue a statement under the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and resolve the disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan area through peaceful negotiations without resorting to threats or force. However, contrary to what Dulles claimed in his September 4th statement, it was precisely the United States that refused to issue such a statement, and later even unilaterally suspended the talks themselves. After the Chinese government requested the resumption of talks within a certain period in July this year, the U.S. government, although it did not respond in a timely manner, finally appointed an ambassador-level representative. Now, the U.S. government has again expressed its willingness to resolve the disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan area through peaceful negotiations. In order to make another effort to maintain peace, the Chinese government is prepared to resume the ambassadorial talks between the two countries. However, the danger of war created by the United States in the Taiwan area has not been reduced as a result. Given that the U.S. government often acts inconsistently with its words and often uses the smokescreen of peaceful negotiations to cover up its actual actions of continuously expanding aggression, all the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world must not relax in the slightest their struggle against U.S. interference in China's internal affairs and threats to peace in the Far East and the world.

VI. The international dispute between China and the United States in the Taiwan Strait area and the internal affair of the Chinese people liberating their own territory are two matters of completely different nature. The United States has consistently attempted to confuse these two matters in order to cover up its aggression against and interference in China. This is absolutely impermissible. The Chinese people are fully entitled to take all appropriate measures, at the appropriate time, to liberate their own territory, and no foreign interference is allowed. If the U.S. government disregards the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world, continues to carry out aggression and interference against China, and imposes war on the Chinese people, the U.S. government must bear all the serious consequences arising therefrom.

　　周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明
    中国政府完全有权对盘据在沿海岛屿的蒋介石部队给予坚决的打击和采取必要的军事行动，任何外来的干涉，都是侵犯中国主权的罪恶行为。中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和澎湖列岛的决心是不可动摇的，中国人民尤其不能容忍在自己的大陆内海中存在着像金门、马祖这些沿海岛屿的直接威胁。美国的任何战争挑衅都绝对吓不倒中国人民，相反地，只会激起六万万人民更大的愤怒和更坚强的同美国侵略者斗争到底的决心。如果美国政府悍然不顾中国人民的再三警告和世界人民的和平愿望，继续对中国进行侵略和干涉，把战争强加在中国人民的头上，美国政府必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。
    新华社6日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明　　　　　　　　　　1958年9月6日
    1958年9月4日，美国国务卿杜勒斯，在美国总统艾森豪威尔授权之下，发表声明，公然威胁要在台湾海峡地区扩大对中华人民共和国的侵略范围，进行战争挑衅，从而加剧了美国在这个地区造成的紧张局势，使远东和世界的和平受到了严重的威胁。为此，我受权代表中华人民共和国政府发表声明如下：
    一、台湾和澎湖列岛自古就是中国的领土。在第二次世界大战以后，它们已经由日本的一度侵占归还了中国。中国人民行使主权解放这些地区，完全是中国的内政。这是中国人民的神圣不可侵犯的权利。美国政府自己也曾经正式声明不在台湾地区卷入中国的内争。如果不是因为美国政府后来背弃自己的声明进行了武装干涉，台湾和澎湖列岛早已获得解放，早已在中华人民共和国政府的管辖之下。这是全世界一切公正舆论所一致承认的、不可抹煞的事实。
    二、美国支持盘据在台湾和澎湖列岛的早已被全中国人民唾弃的蒋介石集团，并且直接用武力侵占台湾和澎湖列岛，是干涉中国内政、侵犯中国领土完整和主权的非法行为，是同联合国宪章和一切国际法准则直接冲突的。美国和蒋介石集团签订的任何所谓条约和美国国会通过的任何有关的决议，对于中国人民是完全无效的，它们决不能使美国的侵略行为合法化，更不能成为美国在台湾海峡地区扩大侵略范围的借口。
    三、蒋介石集团在美国的支持之下，长期以来就以逼近厦门的金门和逼近福州的马祖等大陆沿海岛屿为前哨据点，对中国大陆进行种种骚扰和破坏活动。最近，在美国对于阿拉伯国家发动武装干涉以后，蒋介石集团对中国大陆的骚扰和破坏也更为猖獗。中国政府完全有权对盘据在沿海岛屿的蒋介石部队给予坚决的打击和采取必要的军事行动，任何外来的干涉，都是侵犯中国主权的罪恶行为。但是，美国为了转移世界人民对于美国在中东继续侵略、拖延自黎巴嫩撤兵的注意，竟企图利用这种情况，在台湾海峡地区大量集结武装力量，公开威胁要把它在台湾海峡地区的侵略范围扩大到金门、马祖等沿海岛屿。这是对六万万中国人民严重的战争挑衅，是对远东和世界和平的严重威胁。
    四、中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和澎湖列岛的决心是不可动摇的。中国人民尤其不能容忍在自己的大陆内海中存在着像金门、马祖这些沿海岛屿的直接威胁。美国的任何战争挑衅都绝对吓不倒中国人民，相反地，只会激起六万万人民更大的愤怒和更坚强的同美国侵略者斗争到底的决心。美国在黎巴嫩的侵略军还没有撤走，马上就又在台湾海峡地区制造新的战争危险，这就使全世界爱好和平的国家和人民更加认清了美国侵略者蓄意破坏和平的蛮横面目，更加认清了美国帝国主义是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲一切民族独立运动和世界和平运动的最凶恶的敌人。
    五、中国政府根据自己的和平外交政策，一贯主张不同社会制度的国家按照五项原则实行和平共处，并且用和平谈判的方法解决一切国际争端。尽管美国以武力侵占了中国的台湾和澎湖列岛，粗暴地破坏了国际关系中最起码的准则，中国政府仍然倡议同美国政府坐下来谈判，谋求台湾地区紧张局势的和缓和消除。在1955年8月开始的中美大使级会谈中，中国方面曾经多次建议，双方在互相尊重主权和领土完整和互不干涉内政的原则下发表声明，通过和平谈判解决中美两国之间在台湾地区的争端而互不诉诸威胁或武力。但是，同杜勒斯在9月4日的声明中所宣称的相反，恰恰是美国拒绝发表这样的声明，到后来连会谈本身也被美国片面中断了。在今年7月中国政府要求限期恢复会谈以后，美国政府虽然没有及时答复，但是终于指派了大使级代表。现在，美国政府又表示愿意通过和平谈判来解决中美两国在中国台湾地区的争端。为了再一次进行维护和平的努力，中国政府准备恢复两国大使级会谈。但是美国在中国台湾地区所造成的战争危险并未因此减轻。鉴于美国政府往往行不顾言，并且往往用和平谈判的烟幕掩盖它不断扩大侵略的实际行动，全中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民决不能丝毫放松反对美国干涉中国内政、威胁远东和世界和平的斗争。
    六、中国和美国在台湾海峡地区的国际争端和中国人民解放自己领土的内政问题，是性质完全不同的两件事。美国一贯企图把这两件事混淆起来，以掩盖它对中国的侵略和干涉。这是绝对不能容许的。中国人民完全有权采取一切适当的方法，在适当的时候，解放自己的领土，不容许任何外国干涉。如果美国政府悍然不顾中国人民的再三警告和世界人民的和平愿望，继续对中国进行侵略和干涉，把战争强加在中国人民的头上，美国政府必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。
