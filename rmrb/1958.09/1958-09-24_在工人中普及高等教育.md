Popularizing Higher Education Among Workers
Li Xianmin

In the instructions on education work issued by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, it was proposed that "We should vigorously develop secondary and higher education, and strive to basically enable all young people and adults in the country who have the conditions and are willing to receive higher education in about fifteen years. We will use about fifteen years to popularize higher education." This is a great and ambitious goal. Implementing this instruction will not only thoroughly realize the socialist revolution and complete socialist construction, and not only enable the country to develop education faster, better, and more economically, but more importantly, it can create conditions for our country to transition to communism and accelerate the process of transition to communism. Because a communist society will be a society where mental and physical labor, urban and rural areas are completely combined, and a society where everyone has a high degree of socialist consciousness, scientific and cultural knowledge, and can engage in various productive labor, it is difficult to achieve without popularizing higher education.

The task of popularizing higher education is possible and should be realized first in factories and enterprises. Because factories and mines have more advantages in running schools than government agencies, rural areas, and streets. The working class feels the most deeply about the suffering of being uneducated, and their demand for learning cultural and scientific knowledge is urgent, and their awareness is also very high; the foundation of factory spare-time education is better than that of streets and rural areas; factories, especially large and medium-sized factories, also have great potential for running schools, with good machinery and equipment, laboratories, and a strong force of engineering and technical personnel, as well as experienced old workers who can be both students and teachers. As long as the enthusiasm of factories to run schools is fully utilized, they can not only run middle and primary schools, but also run specialized schools and universities, and not only train talents for their own factories, but also train talents for other departments. Therefore, factory-run schools are a shortcut to train the working class's own intellectuals and popularize higher education faster, better, and more economically.

To vigorously develop factory-run schools and strive to basically popularize higher education in about fifteen years, we must go through struggle. This struggle will be long-term and repeated. Because the victory of this struggle will mean the complete death of the old capitalist educational thought and the high development of the new communist educational thought; the victory of this struggle also means the complete failure of dogmatism and the promoters of regression, and the complete victory of Marxist educational thought and the promoters of progress. In fact, this struggle is already going on acutely. Some people have raised such a question to us: "Can the schools run by factories, especially the universities run by factories, be called universities?" This is a reflection of different views on the standards of universities. We believe that if the education policy of serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor, and the education must be led by the Party, is implemented, regardless of whether it has famous professors or the size of the school, it is a qualified university. On the contrary, a university that has not implemented this policy, no matter how many famous professors it has or how big the school is, cannot be called a qualified socialist university. However, bourgeois educators do not see it this way. They believe that running a university must have a certain scale and have some famous professors with very high degrees, otherwise it cannot be called a university. This is the fundamental difference between bourgeois educators and us. This difference must be resolved with resolute struggle. Some people have also put forward such a conclusive opinion, believing that factory-run schools and school-run factories "will inevitably reduce the quality of teaching and inevitably lead to the demise of education." What is the quality of education? What we require is that students acquire relatively complete and broad knowledge, that is, "the educated should be developed in moral, intellectual, and physical aspects, and become educated laborers with socialist consciousness." Such talents are the comprehensively developed talents needed for socialist construction and future communist construction, and are the highest quality of education. What bourgeois scholars demand is the opposite of what we demand. They require students to only learn knowledge from books in school, otherwise it is so-called "reducing the quality of teaching." Running schools according to our requirements will only improve the quality of teaching, thus developing communist education and eliminating bourgeois education. The former must be developed, and the latter should be eliminated.

Our Party's education policy is to combine education with productive labor. However, some comrades stubbornly oppose education and production, believing that factories and schools can only be run separately and cannot be run together, and that running education cannot do a good job in production, and doing production cannot do a good job in education. They do not understand that school-run factories and factory-run schools are an advanced form of combining education with productive labor and are the only way to combine mental and physical labor. Factories running schools and schools running factories are both trending towards part-work and part-study, which lays a good foundation for eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor and opens up a path for cultivating new communist people. Therefore, it is wrong to regard education and production as opposing each other.

Developing education in factories and running higher education on a large scale must go through serious and sharp struggles. Only by adhering to unremitting struggle can we ensure that factories and enterprises first achieve the task of young people and adults receiving higher education in about fifteen years, eliminate the difference between physical and mental labor, and cultivate new talents for communism.

    在工人中普及高等教育
    李先民
    在中共中央、国务院发布的关于教育工作的指示中提出：“应当大力发展中等教育和高等教育，争取在十五年左右的时间内，基本上做到使全国青年和成年，凡是有条件的和自愿的，都可以受到高等教育。我们将以十五年左右的时间来普及高等教育。”这是一个伟大而豪迈的奋斗目标。贯彻执行这一指示，不仅可以彻底实现社会主义革命和完成社会主义建设，不仅可以使国家多快好省地发展教育事业，更重要的是它能够为我国向共产主义过渡创设条件，加速向共产主义过渡的进程。因为共产主义社会将是一个脑力劳动和体力劳动、城市和乡村完全结合的社会，将是一个人人都有高度社会主义觉悟、科学文化知识的能从事各种生产劳动的全面发展的社会，不普及高等教育是很难做得到的。
    普及高等教育的任务，有可能并且应该首先在工厂、企业中实现。因为厂矿办学比机关、农村、街道办学有更多的优越条件。工人阶级对没有文化的苦处感受最深，学习文化科学知识的要求是迫切的，他们的自觉性也很高；工厂业余教育的基础比街道、农村都要好些；工厂特别是大、中型工厂的办学潜力也很大，那里有良好的机器设备、试验室；工程技术人员的力量也很雄厚，也有经验丰富的老工人，他们既可以当学生也可以当先生。只要充分发挥工厂办学的积极性，不仅可以办中、小学，而且也可以办专科学校和大学，不仅可以为本厂培养人材，也可为其它部门培养人材。所以工厂办学是多快好省培养工人阶级自己的知识分子和普及高等教育的捷径。
    要大力发展工厂办学校，争取在十五年左右的时间基本普及高等教育，必须经过斗争。这个斗争将是长期的、反复的。因为这个斗争的胜利，将意味着旧的资本主义教育思想的彻底死亡，新的共产主义教育思想的高度发扬；这个斗争的胜利，也意味着教条主义和促退派的彻底失败，马克思主义教育思想和促进派的彻底胜利。事实上这个斗争已经在尖锐地进行着。有些人向我们提出这样一个问题，工厂办的学校特别是工厂办的大学，“能否叫大学？”这就是对大学规格的不同看法的反映。我们认为贯彻了教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合，教育必须由党来领导的教育方针，不管它有没有名教授，也不管这个学校的气派大小，都是合格的大学，反之，没有贯彻这个方针的大学，尽管它有多少有名气的教授，学校的气派有多大，都不能叫合格的社会主义大学。但是，资产阶级教育学者不这样看，他们认为办大学必须有个气派，必须有一些很高学位的名教授，否则就不叫大学。这是资产阶级教育学者同我们的根本分歧点。这个分歧点必须用坚决的斗争加以解决。还有一些人提出这样一个结论性的意见，认为工厂办学校，学校办工厂，“必然降低教学质量，必然导致教育事业的灭亡”。什么是教育质量呢？我们所要求的是使学生得到比较完全和比较广博的知识，也就是“应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”这样的人材，是为社会主义建设和将来的共产主义建设所需要的全面发展的人材，是最高的教育质量。资产阶级学者所要求的却与我们相反，他们要求学生在学校只能从书本子上学习知识，否则就是所谓“降低教学质量”。按照我们的要求办学，只会提高教学质量，因而，发展的是共产主义教育，消灭的是资产阶级教育。前者必须发展，后者应该消灭。
    我们党的教育方针是教育与生产劳动结合。有一部分同志却硬把教育同生产对立起来，认为工厂同学校只能分办，不能合办，办教育就不能搞好生产，搞生产就不能办好教育。他们不了解学校办工厂，工厂办学校是教育同生产劳动相结合的高级形式，是使脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的必由之路。工厂办了学校，学校办了工厂，都趋向于半工半读了，就为消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别打好了基础，就为培养共产主义的新人开辟了道路。所以，把教育和生产作为对立的看法是错误的。
    在工厂发展教育事业，大办高等教育，必须经过严重而尖锐的斗争。只有坚持不懈的斗争，才能保证工厂企业在十五年左右的时间内，首先实现青年和成年受到高等教育的任务，消除体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别，为共产主义培养新的人材。
