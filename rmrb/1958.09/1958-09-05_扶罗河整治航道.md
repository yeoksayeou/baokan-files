    Dredging the Fuluo River Channel
    The Fuluo River in Guangning County, Guangdong Province, has a large slope, with a height difference of more than 70 meters between the upper and lower reaches. The water flow is rapid, the river channel is narrow, the stone beaches are stacked, and the water depth is less than 0.2 meters, making navigation inconvenient. The Gushui wooden sailboat cooperative in this county has organized a blasting team to dredge the Fuluo River channel, which is expected to be put into transportation in mid-September.

    扶罗河整治航道
    广东省广宁县境内的扶罗河坡度很大，上下游高度相差七十公尺以上，水流湍急，河道狭窄，石滩叠叠，水深不足零点二公尺，航行不便。这个县的古水木帆船社已组织了一个炸礁队，整治扶罗河航道，预计9月中旬可以投入运输。　（黄英能）
