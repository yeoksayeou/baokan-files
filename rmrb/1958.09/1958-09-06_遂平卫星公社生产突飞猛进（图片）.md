　　Suiping Satellite Commune's Production Leaps Forward
    After the establishment of the Suiping County Satellite Commune in Henan Province, due to the commune's large wealth and the rational allocation and use of all labor and land, as well as the strengthening of cadre conditions and construction technical forces, it immediately demonstrated the great superiority of further developing production and implementing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture.

　　The Satellite Commune has implemented "military organization, combat action, and collective living" in production. This is the women's commando team of the Tushan Village production team of the first basic-level commune gathering for roll call, preparing to set off to accumulate fertilizer. Top left is the "Time Soldier" of the Iron and Steel Corps mining at Mount Chaya, carrying out their mission. Everyone's work and rest times are based on bugle calls.
　　The millet of the Qizhuang production team of the fourth basic-level commune has already yielded a bumper harvest. This is the commune members threshing the grain. Lower left is female commune member Qi Ailian selecting many of the best millet ears to keep as seeds.
　　Cadres of the commune's directly affiliated units have built a blast furnace complex beside the road to the railway station. This is a pig iron furnace that has just been put into production.

　　The large reservoir built by the first basic-level commune was impossible for the former smaller communes to build. The reservoir has now stored water that can irrigate 25,000 mu of fertile land. These are the commune members completing the final project – the diversion channel.

　　遂平卫星公社生产突飞猛进
    河南省遂平县卫星公社建成后，由于社大财大，对所有劳力和土地作了合理的调配使用，在干部条件和建设技术力量方面也更形加强，因此立即显示出进一步发展生产、实行工农业并举的极大优越性。

　　卫星公社在生产上都实行了“组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化”。这是第一基层社土山村生产队的妇女突击队正在集合点名，准备出发积肥。左上是嵖岈山开矿的钢铁兵团的“时间兵”在执行任务，大家作息时间都听号音。
　　第四基层社齐庄生产队的谷子已获丰收，这是社员们正在碾场。左下图是女社员齐爱莲挑选了许多最好的谷穗留作种子。
　　公社直属单位的干部已在去火车站的路旁建起了高炉群。这是刚投入生产的炼铁炉。
    右上：第四基层社炼钢炉正在出钢。
　　第一基层社修建的这座大水库是过去小社办不到的。水库现已拦蓄的水能浇灌两万五千亩良田。这是公社社员们正在完成最后的工程——引水道。
