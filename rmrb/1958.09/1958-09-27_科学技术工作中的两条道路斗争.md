The struggle between two roads in scientific and technological work

Shao Shiping

In recent years, the scientific, technological, and cultural work in our province (Jiangxi) has developed from the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. When the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, the people, and socialism, their attacks in the fields of science, technology, and culture were extremely wild. After the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the bourgeois rightists' offensive was crushed. Now, the technological revolution and the cultural revolution have become the central tasks for implementing the general line of socialist construction and accelerating the speed of socialist construction. However, because throughout the entire transition period, that is, before the completion of socialism, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, is always the main contradiction within our country, this struggle between the two roads will inevitably be constantly reflected on the scientific, technological, and cultural front. Therefore, it is necessary to re-propose the issues related to science, technology, and culture in the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle here as lessons of experience. What are the problems?

Rely on the laboring people
for the technological revolution and the cultural revolution.

1.  Who should be relied upon for the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, and which class? The bourgeois rightists believe that they should be mainly relied upon, and they must be relied upon. They crowned themselves as big intellectuals, boasted themselves to be very great, and regarded themselves as remarkable figures. It seems that without relying on them, the sky would fall and the earth would sink. They regard science, technology, and culture as the bourgeoisie's patent, believing that workers, peasants, and other broad masses of laboring people are not qualified to engage in science, technology, and culture. They touted science, technology, and culture as mysterious and unpredictable, and used this to scare workers and peasants, attempting to exclude these people from the gate of science, technology, and culture.

We believe that the technological revolution and the cultural revolution should mainly rely on the working class, the peasant masses, and other broad masses of laboring people. Only when bourgeois intellectuals recognize the leadership of the working class, recognize that the workers, peasants, and other broad masses of laboring people are the main reliance of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, accept socialist transformation, and wholeheartedly serve socialism, can they become useful forces. We believe that most of them can be transformed into red experts who are both red and expert in the great socialist revolution and socialist construction. The bourgeois rightists are not only not the so-called reliance forces they crowned themselves, but precisely what our revolution must resolutely oppose. Without them, the sky will not fall, and the earth will not sink. Science, technology, and culture are not mysterious and unpredictable things. They are people's understanding of the laws of objective things' development from social production and life practices, and are things that everyone can master. If in the old society, our workers, peasants, and other broad masses of laboring people were oppressed and exploited by reactionary rulers and had no opportunity to master science, technology, and culture, now they have. This was brought about by the revolution. In a socialist society, it is already impossible for anyone to exclude workers, peasants, and other broad masses of laboring people from the gate of science, technology, and culture. If anyone opposes the workers, peasants, and other broad masses of laboring people rising up to master science, technology, and culture, we will revolt against them.

The first issue in the struggle between the two roads is like this.

The laboring people can greatly improve the level of science, technology, and culture.

2.  Wouldn't doing this make science, technology, and culture very low-level? The bourgeois rightist elements clamored precisely in this way. We affirm that when workers, peasants, and other broad masses of laboring people all rise up to master science, technology, and culture, the level of science, technology, and culture will not only not decrease, but will greatly improve. When bourgeois intellectuals demanded "abolishing the imperial examination system and establishing schools," didn't feudal landlord class elements also scold them for "abolishing the imperial examination system and establishing schools" as being very low-level and doing things improperly? I ask, did it decrease or increase? We say that in those years, when bourgeois science and culture rose up to revolutionize and replace feudal culture, the level of science, technology, and culture did not decrease, but increased. With the development of society, for the same reason, now it is proletarian socialist science and culture rising up to revolutionize and replace bourgeois science and culture, and the level of science, technology, and culture is absolutely not decreasing, but greatly increasing. This is the law of social development and is independent of people's will. Countless facts prove that the more superior the social system, the more widespread the people who master science, technology, and culture will be, and the higher the level of science, technology, and culture will be. Only when workers, peasants, and other broad masses of laboring people all rise up to master science, technology, and culture can science, technology, and culture truly obtain unlimited development and improvement.

The second issue in the struggle between the two roads is like this.

The class nature of natural science is reflected in who masters and utilizes it.

3.  Does science have a class nature? The bourgeois rightists desperately feigned and described science as something without a class nature. We affirm that in a society with classes, science has a class nature. "In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of ideas are branded with a class." When bourgeois rightists frantically attacked the Party, the people, and socialism, their attacks in the fields of science, technology, and culture were extremely wild. Doesn't this fully illustrate the class nature of science?

Some people say: Only philosophy and social sciences have a class nature, while natural science does not have a class nature. Undoubtedly, philosophy and social sciences have a class nature; and natural science can be divided into two aspects. Understood as pure natural science, it can be said that it has no class nature. This is one aspect. On the other hand, natural science must be utilized by people, and in terms of mastery and utilization, it also has a class nature. Because natural science is like guns, for example, the Kuomintang reactionary army picked up weapons manufactured by imperialism to fight the People's Liberation Army, and the People's Liberation Army captured the enemy's weapons and picked them up to fight imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary army. This is a clear manifestation of class nature. In a society with classes, how can one look at natural science in isolation and set aside the class nature in mastering and utilizing natural science?

The third issue in the struggle between the two roads is like this.

It is a general rule that laymen lead experts.

4.  Who should lead socialist science, technology, and culture? When bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, the people, and socialism, they clamored everywhere: "The Chinese Communist Party cannot lead science, technology, and culture," "Laymen cannot lead experts." They styled themselves as "experts" and opposed the Communist Party's leadership over science, technology, and culture, wanting to be led by them. This is truly arrogant and shameless to the extreme.

The Chinese Communist Party is the only leading core of our country and the most fundamental guarantee for the victorious development of all revolutionary undertakings in our country. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can the cause of science, technology, and culture have today's unprecedented development. This is scientific truth. The victorious overfulfillment of the first five-year plan, the all-round great leap forward in socialist construction, the rapid development of science, technology, and culture, various creations and inventions, and countless great miracles, all fully prove this truth. Therefore, any attempt to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party in any socialist undertaking is reactionary. It is the same in the cause of science, technology, and culture, with no exception.

The bourgeois rightists raised the issue that laymen cannot lead experts. I ask, what kind of experts are those rightist elements in our province? Our province produced a national-level rightist leader named Luo Longji. Is he an expert in science, technology, and culture? I think he is not an expert in science, technology, and culture, but an out-and-out bourgeois rightist expert. Precisely for this reason, our provincial people's congress unanimously passed the resolution to revoke Luo Longji's qualification as a representative of the National People's Congress. Isn't this divinely ordained?

According to scientific saying, "Laymen leading experts" is a general rule. The saying that "laymen cannot lead experts" violates the general rule. The reality of society is that everyone is an expert and everyone is a layman. If there are ten thousand industries in the world, ten thousand kinds of science and technology, and ten thousand kinds of occupations, each person can only be proficient in one or a few industries. For the one or few industries that he is proficient in, he is an expert, and for the other majority of industries that he is not proficient in, he is a layman. For example, Mr. Mei Lanfang can sing operas, but he is only good at Qingyi. Qingyi is a type of Dan role. Dan roles alone have five types: Xiaodan, Huadan, Chouda, Wudan, and Laodan. In addition to Dan roles, there are other roles in opera, such as Laosheng, Xiaosheng, etc. He can only be proficient in one role out of many roles. He is an expert in singing Qingyi, and he is also a layman in singing other roles. As for other industries in society, he is even more of a layman. From this, it can be seen that everyone is an expert and everyone is a layman. This is the reality of society. From the perspective of leadership, it is a general rule and a scientific truth that laymen lead experts.

For our Party's leading cadres, it is necessary for us to touch and be slightly familiar with other industries besides our own. It is possible to be familiar with several industries, but it is impossible to be familiar with many. There must always be a specialty, and we must achieve both redness and expertise, being thoroughly red and deeply expert.

The fourth issue in the struggle between the two roads is like this.

From the struggle between the two roads, we have more basis, confidence, and courage for mobilizing the people of the whole province to march toward science, technology, and culture.

Communists also have revolutionary traditions in natural science.

Scientific culture belongs to the social ideological form. A certain social ideological form is a reflection of the politics and economy of a certain society and also exerts a tremendous influence and effect on the politics and economy of a certain society. This is scientific truth. The great march of the technological revolution and cultural revolution that we are currently carrying out is a reflection of the decisive victory that China's current socialist revolution has already achieved and the all-round great leap forward in socialist construction. It must be and cannot but serve the resolute implementation of the Party's general line of socialist construction and serve the great leap forward in socialist construction.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people are rich in revolutionary traditions. This revolutionary tradition is the same on the scientific, technological, and cultural revolution front. Since its establishment, the Chinese Communist Party has armed itself and the broad masses of the people with Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, in philosophy and social sciences, it has extremely rich traditions both in theory and practice. The great Chinese revolution (democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction) has won victory under the guidance of the theories and thoughts of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. This victory is currently leaping forward at a speed of "one day equals twenty years."

Some people say that the Chinese Communist Party has a very high level in philosophy and social sciences, but it does not understand natural science very well, because in this area, there is no revolutionary tradition. Although this view seems to have some truth on the surface, it is actually wrong and inconsistent with the development of facts. In the great revolutionary war, the Communist Party led the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army not only in heroic struggles with the enemy but also in arduous struggles with nature, overcoming enormous difficulties, defeating the enemy, developing production, opening many factories and agricultural experimental farms in the base areas, opening many schools and hospitals, and establishing many scientific research institutions. In Yan'an, a scientific research institute was established. Are these not works that belong to natural science? Of course, at that time, class struggle, especially revolutionary war, was the main focus. In the situation where everything was subordinate to winning the victory of the revolutionary war, it was only natural that work in the field of natural science was in a secondary position. However, we cannot therefore think that the Communists do not understand natural science, let alone think that the Party has no revolutionary tradition in leading natural science work. Under the conditions of revolutionary war, combining the universal laws of natural science with specific circumstances, relying on the broad masses of workers and peasants, seeking truth from facts, overcoming difficulties, solving problems, serving the war, and serving production—this is the Party's revolutionary tradition in natural science work.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, with the great victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, under the leadership of the Party, philosophy and social sciences have greatly developed, and natural science has also greatly developed. The development of natural science is inseparable from carrying forward the Party's revolutionary traditions in natural science work. On the basis of the victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, a high tide of an all-round great leap forward in socialist construction has been rapidly set off, and the work of natural science has also set off a high tide of the great leap forward.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have long called on us to strive to learn scientific knowledge throughout the Party, to unite with non-Party intellectuals, and to strive to catch up with the world's advanced level of science. This is fully justified.

Only by thoroughly defeating bourgeois ideology can we promote a great leap forward in scientific work.

In the mobilization of the people of the whole province to march toward science, technology, and culture, are there still ideological struggles between the two roads? It is certain that there are. In most cases, it is different in nature from the enemy-ourselves struggle between us and the Rightists regarding science, technology, and culture work last year, and we should never confuse them. The bourgeois Rightists are launching a rampant attack on the Party, the people, and socialism, which belongs to the nature of the enemy-ourselves struggle. However, within our people, there are still many science, technology, and culture workers who, although politically supporting the socialist system and the leadership of the Party, and are unwilling to abandon the bourgeois worldview, thinking methods, and technical views in science, technology, and culture work, due to the influence of class origin and long-term capitalist education and work environment, still exist to varying degrees with individualism, fame and gain, and so on. In this way, the ideological struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in science, technology, and culture work is inevitable. This struggle must be carried out to the end, and the bourgeois ideology must be thoroughly defeated with proletarian ideology in order to promote the great leap forward in scientific work.

Correctly handle advanced versus backward in science, technology, and culture work.

Of course, in science, technology, and culture work, in addition to the struggle between the two roads, there are also two methods - the struggle between the method of more, faster, better, and more economical, and the method of less, slower, worse, and more expensive. There are also struggles between advanced and backward, correct and wrong in understanding. Therefore, we cannot regard all issues in science, technology, and culture as issues of the two roads. Such simplification is wrong. For any issue, we must, in accordance with the Party's general line of socialist construction and the spirit of Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," as well as the Party's guidelines and policies in science, technology, and culture work, seek truth from facts, make concrete analysis, and handle correctly. The method of rectification, the method of great airing of views, great debates, big-character posters, and criticism and self-criticism, is a method for correctly handling contradictions among the people, and it is also a method for transforming ideology, improving work, and exploring the truth, and should also be used in science, technology, and culture work. The policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" must continue to be implemented. For fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, we believe that the broad masses of people have raised their socialist consciousness and are able to distinguish them clearly.

We must write on the red flag of the great march of technological revolution and cultural revolution: Politics takes command, the whole people are mobilized, and a new upsurge of technological revolution and cultural revolution is rapidly set off. Resolutely eliminate all obstacles to technological revolution and culture revolution, and build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern scientific culture as soon as possible.

    科学技术工作中的两条道路斗争
    邵式平
    几年来，我省（江西省）科学技术文化工作，是从社会主义同资本主义两条道路斗争中发展起来的。当资产阶级右派向党向人民向社会主义疯狂进攻的时候，针对科学技术文化方面的进攻表现得极为疯狂。经过整风运动和反右派斗争，资产阶级右派的进攻被粉碎了。现在，技术革命和文化革命已成为贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线和加快社会主义建设速度的中心任务了。但是由于在整个过渡时期，也就是在社会主义建成以前，无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，社会主义道路同资本主义道路的斗争，始终是我国内部的主要矛盾，所以这种两条道路的斗争，必然会不断地反映到科学技术文化战线上来。因此，把在整风运动和反右派斗争中有关科学技术文化方面的问题，在这里重新提出来，作为经验教训，是需要的。有哪些问题呢？
    进行技术革命和文化革命
    主要应该依靠劳动人民
    一、技术革命和文化革命主要是依靠谁，依靠哪个阶级？资产阶级右派认为主要是依靠他们，而且必须依靠他们。他们把自己封为大知识分子，把自己吹得蛮大，把自己看成是了不起的人物。好像不依靠他们，天就会塌下来，地就会沉下去。他们把科学技术文化看成是资产阶级的专利品，认为工人、农民以及其他广大劳动人民，是没有资格搞科学技术文化的。他们把科学技术文化吹得神秘莫测，并以此来吓唬工人农民，企图把这些人都排斥在科学技术文化的大门之外。
    我们认为，技术革命和文化革命主要是依靠工人阶级、农民群众以及其他广大劳动人民。资产阶级知识分子只有承认工人阶级的领导，承认工农群众以及其他广大劳动人民是技术革命和文化革命的主要依靠，并接受社会主义改造，诚心诚意为社会主义服务，才能成为有用的力量。我们相信，他们中的大多数，在伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，是可以改造成为又红又专的红色专家的。资产阶级右派分子则不仅不是他们自封的所谓依靠力量，而正是我们革命所要坚决反对的。没有他们，天不会塌，地不会沉。科学技术文化并不是神秘莫测的东西，它是人们从社会的生产生活实践中对客观事物发展规律的认识，是人人都能够掌握的东西。如果说在旧社会，我们工人农民以及其他广大劳动人民，受到了反动统治
  者的压迫和剥削，没有机会掌握科学技术文化，而现在有了。这是革命革来的。在社会主义的社会里，谁再要把工人农民以及其他广大劳动人民排斥在科学技术文化的大门之外，已经是不可能了。谁要反对工人农民及其他广大劳动人民起来掌握科学技术文化，我们就要革他的命。
    两条道路斗争的第一个问题，就是这样。
    劳动人民可以大大提高科学技术文化的水平
    二、这样做，科学技术文化岂不是低级得很吗？资产阶级右派分子正是这样叫嚣的。我们肯定认为，工人农民以及其他广大劳动人民都起来掌握科学技术文化，科学技术文化水平不仅不会降低，而会大为提高。当资产阶级知识分子要求“废科举、办学堂”的时候，封建地主阶级分子不也是大骂他们“废科举、办学堂”低级得很，搞得不像话吗？试问是降低了，还是提高了呢？我们说，当年以资产阶级的科学文化起来革封建文化的命并代替它，科学技术文化水平不是降低了，而是提高了。随着社会的发展，以同样的理由，现在是无产阶级社会主义的科学文化起来革资产阶级的科学文化的命并代替它，科学技术文化水平绝对不是降低了，而是大为提高了。这是社会发展的规律，是不以人们的意志为转移的。无数的事实证明，社会制度越是优越，掌握科学技术文化的人就会越加广泛，科学技术文化的水平也就越高。只有工人农民以及其他广大劳动人民都起来掌握科学技术文化，科学技术文化才能得到真正无限度的发展和提高。
    两条道路斗争的第二个问题，就是这样。
    自然科学的阶级性表现在谁来掌握和利用它
    三、科学是否有阶级性？资产阶级右派分子拚命装腔作势，把科学说成是没有阶级性的东西。我们肯定地说，在有阶级的社会里，科学是有阶级性的。“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印”。资产阶级右派分子向党向人民向社会主义疯狂进攻的时候，对科学技术文化方面的进攻表现得极为疯狂，难道不是充分地说明了科学的阶级性吗？
    有人说：哲学社会科学才有阶级性，自然科学是没有阶级性的。无疑地，哲学社会科学是有阶级性的；而自然科学可以分为两个方面，作为纯自然科学来理解，可以说是没有阶级性的，这是一个方面。另一个方面，自然科学是一定要人来利用的，在掌握利用上又是有阶级性的。因为自然科学和枪炮一样，比方说，国民党反动军队拿起帝国主义制造的武器来打人民解放军，人民解放军把敌人的武器缴来了，拿起来打帝国主义和国民党反动军队，这就是阶级性的明显表现。在有阶级的社会里，怎样能够孤立地看待自然科学，而撇开在掌握和利用自然科学方面的阶级性呢？
    两条道路斗争的第三个问题，就是这样。
    外行领导内行这是一般规律
    四、社会主义的科学技术文化事业该谁领导？资产阶级右派分子疯狂地向党向人民向社会主义进攻的时候，到处叫嚣：“中国共产党不能领导科学技术文化”，“外行不能领导内行”。他们自命为“内行”，反对共产党领导科学技术文化，而要由他们来领导。这真是狂妄无耻，无以复加。
    中国共产党是我们国家的唯一领导核心，是我国一切革命事业胜利发展的最根本的保证。科学技术文化事业，只有在中国共产党领导下，才有今天这样空前的发展，这是科学的真理。第一个五年计划的胜利超额完成，社会主义建设的全面大跃进，科学技术文化的飞速发展，各种各样的创造和发明，数不尽的伟大奇迹，都充分地证明了这个真理。因此，在社会主义任何事业上，企图反对共产党的领导，都是反动的。在科学技术文化事业上也是一样，决不能例外。
    资产阶级右派分子提出外行不能领导内行，试问我们省里面的那些右派分子，是什么内行呢？我们省里出了个全国性的右派头子，名字叫罗隆基，难道他是科学技术文化的内行吗？我看他不是什么科学技术文化的内行，而是个不折不扣的资产阶级右派内行。正是如此，我们全省人民代表大会一致通过撤销了罗隆基全国人民代表大会的代表资格，难道不是天公地道的吗？
    按照科学的说法，“外行领导内行”是一般的规律。“外行不能领导内行”的说法，是违反一般规律的。社会的现实情况是：人人是内行，人人是外行。如果世界上有一万个行业，有一万种科学技术，有一万种职业，每个人只可能精通一行或几行，对精通的一行或几行说来就是内行，对其他不精通的多数行业就都外行。比方说，梅兰芳先生会唱戏，可是他只擅长青衣。青衣是旦角的一种，光旦角就有五种，小旦、花旦、丑旦、武旦、老旦。唱戏除了旦角以外，还有其他角色，如老生、小生等等。他只能精通许多角色中的一种角色。对唱青衣他就是内行，对唱其他角色他也是外行。至于对社会上其他行业来说，他更是外行了。由此看来，人人是内行，人人是外行，这是社会的现实。从领导来说，外行领导内行，是一般的规律，也是科学的真理。
    对于我们党的领导干部来说，我们除了本行之外，对其他行业也要摸一摸，略微熟悉一下是必要的。要熟悉几个行业是可以的，熟悉很多是不可能的。总要有个专业，做到又红又专，红透专深。
    两条道路斗争的第四个问题，就是这样。
    从两条道路斗争中，就使我们对于全省人民动员起来向科学技术文化大进军，更有了根据，更有了信心和勇气。
    共产党人在自然科学方面也有革命传统
    科学文化，是属于社会观念形态的东西。一定的社会观念形态是一定社会的政治和经济的反映，又给予巨大影响和作用于一定社会的政治和经济。这是科学的真理。我们现在正在开展的技术革命和文化革命的大进军，就是我国当前社会主义革命已经取得了决定性的胜利和社会主义建设全面大跃进的反映，它必然是而且不能不是为坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线服务的，为社会主义建设大跃进服务的。
    在共产党领导下的中国人民是富于革命传统的。这个革命传统，在科学技术文化革命战线上，也是一样。中国共产党自成立之日起，就是以马克思列宁主义来武装自己和广大人民的。因此，在哲学和社会科学上，无论是理论和实践，都具有极为丰富的传统。伟大的中国革命（民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设）就是在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的理论思想指导下取得了胜利。这个胜利当前正在以“一天等于二十年”的速度向前跃进。
    有人说，中国共产党人在哲学社会科学上的水平是很高的，但对自然科学就不大懂，因为在这方面，没有什么革命传统。这种观点虽然从表面上看好像有某些道理，但实际上是错误的，是与事实的发展不相符的。在伟大的革命战争中，共产党领导中国人民和人民解放军，不仅与敌人进行了英勇的斗争，而且也与自然进行了艰巨的斗争，克服了巨大困难，战胜了敌人，发展了生产，在根据地开办了许多的工厂和农业试验场，开办了许多的学校医院，并建立了不少科学研究机构，在延安就成立过科学研究院。难道这些就不是属于自然科学方面的工作吗？当然，在那个时候是以阶级斗争，特别是以革命战争为主的。在一切服从于争取革命战争胜利的情况下，自然科学方面的工作不能不居于次要地位，这是很自然的。但不能因此就认为共产党人不懂自然科学，更不能认为党在领导自然科学工作方面就没有革命传统。在革命战争的条件下，把自然科学的普遍规律和具体环境结合起来，依靠广大工农劳动群众，实事求是，克服困难，解决问题，为战争服务，为生产服务，这就是党在自然科学工作方面的革命传统。
    自中华人民共和国成立以后，随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，在党的领导下，哲学社会科学有了巨大的发展，自然科学也有了巨大的发展，而自然科学的发展，是同发扬了党在自然科学工作方面的革命传统分不开的。在整风运动和反右派斗争胜利的基础上，迅速掀起了社会主义建设全面大跃进的高潮，自然科学工作也随着掀起了大跃进的高潮。
    党中央和毛主席早就号召我们，全党努力学习科学知识，同党外知识分子团结一致，为迅速赶上世界科学的先进水平而奋斗。这是完全有根据的。
    只有彻底战胜资产阶级思想
    才能促进科学工作大跃进
    在全省人民动员起来向科学技术文化的大进军中，是否还有两条道路的思想斗争呢？肯定是有的。在大多数情况下，它同去年我们和右派之间关于科学技术文化工作两条道路的敌我斗争，性质是不同的，决不应该把它们混为一谈。资产阶级右派是向党向人民向社会主义进行猖狂的进攻，是属于敌我性质的。但是在我们人民内部，也还有许多科学技术文化工作者，尽管在政治上拥护社会主义制度和党的领导，而由于阶级出身和长期的资本主义教育和工作环境的影响，在科学技术文化工作中，仍然没有或者还不大愿意抛弃资产阶级的人生观、思想方法和技术观点，仍然或多或少地存在着个人主义、名利观点等等。这样，在科学技术文化工作中，无产阶级同资产阶级的思想斗争就是不可避免的。这一斗争必须进行到底，用无产阶级思想彻底战胜资产阶级的思想，才能促进科学工作的大跃进。
    正确处理科学技术文化工作中
    先进和落后的斗争
    当然，科学技术文化工作中，除了两条道路的斗争外，还有两种方法——多快好省的方法同少慢差费的方法之间的斗争。也还有认识上的先进同落后，正确同错误之间的斗争。因此不能把科学技术文化中的一切问题，都看成是两条道路的问题，这样简单化是错误的。对于任何一个问题，都必须根据党的社会主义建设总路线和毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”报告精神，以及党在科学技术文化工作中的方针政策，实事求是，具体分析，正确处理。整风的方法，大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报、进行批评和自我批评的方法，是正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法，也是改造思想、改进工作的方法和探求真理的方法，在科学技术文化工作中也应该加以使用。“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针必须继续贯彻执行，对于香花和毒草，我们相信，广大人民群众已提高了社会主义觉悟，是能够辨别清楚的。
    我们要在技术革命和文化革命大进军的红旗上写着：政治挂帅，全民动员，迅速掀起技术革命和文化革命的新高潮，坚决扫除技术革命和文化革命的一切障碍，尽快地把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。
