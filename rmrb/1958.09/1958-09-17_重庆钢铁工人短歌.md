Chongqing Steel Workers' Short Songs

The Steel Marshal Sits in the Tent

	The steel marshal sits in the tent,
	Blast furnaces spread like a red sky,
	Molten iron flows like fiery red,
	Surpassing the Yangtze, better than a long rainbow.
	The whole nation fights for steel,
	Taking steel as the key link, competing to be heroes,
	Steel ring for competition,
	Thousands of ingenious plans for increasing production.
	The pig iron task must be completed,
	Double the steel output,
	The whole Party and the people cooperate greatly,
	To realize the leap forward plan early.
		(Yu Qingshan)

Chongqing Steel is like a big hen

	Xiaopo Mountain, by the Yangtze River,
	Molten iron and steel flowers roll like waves,
	Chongqing Steel is like a big hen,
	To lay thousands of steel eggs.

Leap to the Milky Way Shore

	There is only one Milky Way in the sky,
	Open hearth furnace has three grooves for tapping steel,
	Leap to the shore of the Milky Way,
	To build a steel bridge for the Cowherd and Weaver Girl.
		(Wang Shengping)

    重庆钢铁工人短歌钢铁元帅坐帐中钢铁元帅坐帐中，高炉遍布满天红，铁水奔流似火红，胜过长江赛长虹。全国人民为钢战，以钢为纲比英豪，钢铁擂台来比武，增产妙计千万条。生铁任务要完成，钢材产量翻一番，全党全民大协作，跃进计划早实现。
        （于清山）重钢好比大母鸡小坡山，长江边，铁水钢花滚浪翻，重钢好比大母鸡，要下万千钢铁蛋。
  一跃跃登银河岸天上银河只一条，平炉出钢有三槽，一跃跃登银河岸，要为牛女搭钢桥。
            （王升平）
