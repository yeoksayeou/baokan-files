Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th: According to a report in the "Worker's Weekly" on the 14th, the National Executive Committee of the Communist Party of the United States recently issued a statement calling for urgent action to defend the civil rights of black people, stop the atrocities of segregationists against black people, and safeguard constitutional rights.

The statement pointed out that official institutions throughout the American South are openly defying federal courts, disregarding the Constitution, and continuing to infringe upon the most basic civil rights of black people. One state after another has introduced its own regulations, blatantly attempting to abolish the Constitution and national laws on all issues related to the status of black people. For example, since the Supreme Court ruled four years ago that racial segregation in schools was illegal, less than one hundred black children have been permitted to enroll in schools in the Southern states.

The statement went on to say that officially sanctioned police brutality, mob terror, and cruel court sentences have persecuted those who take the lead in opposing segregation.

The statement pointed out that the Eisenhower administration should be primarily responsible for the deterioration of the situation in the South to its current crisis stage. The statement said that the Eisenhower government is only trying to continue appeasing the Southern Democratic bloc in order to maintain their unseemly alliance with Wall Street Republicans, as the basis for controlling Congress to serve the interests of domestic and foreign monopolists. The statement pointed out that it is precisely this collusion with the Southern bloc that has increased the courage of the governors and congressional party hacks of the Southern states, allowing them to be as rampant as they are now.

The statement called for large-scale demonstrations to force the government to take action to protect the rights of black people in the South.

    美国种族歧视逆流泛滥
    美共号召保卫黑人权利
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：据14日的“工人周报”报道，美国共产党全国执行委员会不久前发表声明，号召采取紧急行动保卫黑人的公民权利、制止种族隔离主义者对黑人的暴行和维护宪法权利。
    声明指出，美国整个南方的官方机构都公开违抗联邦法院，蔑视宪法，继续侵犯黑人最基本的公民权利。一个州接一个州提出自己的法规，公然企图在有关黑人地位的一切问题上取消宪法和国家法律。例如，自从四年前最高法院裁决学校中实行种族隔离非法以来，南方各州得到许可入学的黑人儿童不到一百人。
    声明接着说，官方授意的警察暴行、暴徒的恐怖行为和法院的残酷的判决，这一切对那些带头反对种族隔离主义的人进行了迫害。
    声明指出，南方的局势所以能恶化到目前这样的危机阶段，主要应该由艾森豪威尔负责。声明说，艾森豪威尔政府一味想继续姑息民主党南方集团，以便保持它们同华尔街共和党之间不光彩的联盟，作为控制国会为国内外垄断资本家利益服务的基础。声明指出，正是这种同南方集团勾勾搭搭的作法增加了南方各州州长和国会党棍们的胆量，使他们敢于像现在这样嚣张。
    声明号召举行声势浩大的示威游行来迫使政府采取行动保障南方黑人的权利。
