    Mass Mobilization in Three Days and Nights Reverses Backward Situation
    Wu'an Leaps to Become a Thousand-Ton County
    (Our newspaper, Tianjin, 21st dispatch) Wu'an County, Hebei Province, has 9,603 indigenous iron smelting furnaces already in operation. From 00:00 to 24:00 on the 20th, they produced 1,114.5 tons of iron in a single day, creating Hebei Province's first "satellite county" to produce a thousand tons of iron per day.
    Before September 17th, Wu'an County's iron production progressed slowly, with the entire county producing only 162 tons of iron. After repeated publicity regarding the spirit of the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Sixth Plenary Session of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the broad masses of cadres and people deeply recognized the political and economic significance of vigorously developing steel. The high-yield satellite of Lushan County, Henan Province, which produced a thousand tons of iron per day, also gave them great inspiration. The people of the entire county proposed to fight for three days and nights, build 10,000 indigenous iron smelting furnaces, break through the thousand-ton mark, and launch a friendly competition with Lushan County. In the 24 hours of the 18th, the number of people involved in the steel battle in the entire county surged from 20,000 on the 17th to 128,000. All members of the Wu'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China joined the battle, commanding seven corps respectively, and launched a round-the-clock blitzkrieg.
    In order to ensure a great leap forward in pig iron production in a few days, the broad masses worked together to overcome many difficulties. For example, building an indigenous iron smelting furnace requires 200 blue bricks, and building 10,000 furnaces in the entire county requires 2 million bricks. These bricks could not be fired in time. The masses dismantled their own brick walls, brick beds, and broken brick houses to build furnaces. Seven people's communes in the county contributed a total of 1.5 million bricks. After the iron smelting furnaces were built, the demand for ore and coal increased sharply, and they could not be transported in time. The people of the entire county then launched a fierce attack on the "transportation barrier," with 3,600 vehicles of various types投入committed to the transportation front, and 53,000 people carrying ore and coal. Under the leadership of Liu Ying, the first secretary of the Chengguan People's Commune Party Committee, more than 15,000 people were mobilized to transport ore from more than 40 miles away, including more than 300 people using bicycles to transport it. This commune transported 650,000 catties of ore in one night on the 19th, enabling 3,000 indigenous iron smelting furnaces to be quickly put into production. The Tushan Production Team of the Sizhuang People's Commune and others also expanded the indigenous iron smelting furnaces, increasing the iron output per furnace from 300 catties to 4,000 catties. Many people's communes created natural wind iron smelting furnaces, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient air bellows supply.
    Now, this county is advancing victoriously, striving to reach a daily output of 2,000 tons of iron by the end of September, to offer a gift to National Day.

### 全民动员三昼夜扭转落后局面  武安跃为千吨县

    全民动员三昼夜扭转落后局面
    武安跃为千吨县
    本报天津21日电　河北省武安县已经投入生产的九千六百零三座土炼铁炉，在20日零点到二十四点，一整天生产铁一千一百一十四吨半，创造了河北省第一个日产千吨铁的“卫星县”。
    武安县在9月17日以前，铁的生产量进展迟缓，全县仅产铁一百六十二吨。经过反复宣传中共中央政治局扩大会议和中共河北省委第六次全会的精神，广大干部、群众深刻认识到大搞钢铁的政治和经济意义；河南省鲁山县发出日产千吨铁的高产卫星，也给了他们很大启示。全县人民提出要鏖战三昼夜，建土炼铁炉一万座，突破千吨关，向鲁山县开展友谊竞赛。18日一昼夜时间，全县投入钢铁战斗的人数由17日的两万人猛增到十二万八千人。中共武安县委全体委员都投入了战斗，分别指挥着七个兵团，日夜不停地展开了突击战。
    广大群众为保证在几天中使生铁产量来个大跃进，齐心协力克服了许多困难。例如，建一座土炼铁炉就要二百块青砖，全县建一万座，就需要二百万块。这些砖一时烧不出来。群众就把自己的砖墙、砖炕、破房砖拆掉建炉，全县七个人民公社共献出一百五十万块砖。炼铁炉建成后，矿石和煤炭需要量猛增，一时不能运到。全县人民便猛攻“运输关”，有三千六百辆各种车辆投入到运输战线，有五万三千多人背运矿石和煤炭。城关人民公社在党委第一书记刘英等带动下，出动一万五千多人到四十里地以外去运矿石，其中有三百多人用自行车载运。这个社在19日一夜就运矿石六十五万斤，使三千座土炼铁炉迅速投入了生产。寺庄人民公社土山生产队等还扩大了土炼铁炉，使每炉出铁量由三百斤增加到四千斤。不少人民公社创造了自然风炼铁炉，克服了风葫芦供应不足的困难。
    现在，这个县正在乘胜追击，力争到9月底达到日产二千吨铁，向国庆节献礼。
