Everyone is Eager to Try, Eagerly Requesting to Join the Army
Minority Nationalities are Determined to Defend the Motherland

    After we heard Premier Zhou's statement on the radio, everyone expressed their firm support for Premier Zhou's statement and used their own practical actions to fight back against the armed provocations of American imperialism. Lin Chunqing, a Gaoshan ethnic teacher in the Chinese Department, was very angry at the armed aggression of American imperialism. He recalled that Japanese imperialism killed his parents in the past, and today American imperialism is still trampling on Taiwanese compatriots. He was moved to tears when he heard Premier Zhou's statement that he must liberate Taiwan, and he firmly demanded to join the army and go to the front to fight. The Tibetan students in the Preparatory Department II, upon hearing about the liberation of Taiwan, were all eager to try, eagerly requesting to join the army, to turn the principles of serving the people they heard in the classroom into their own practical actions. The Tibetan student Pubu recalled the suffering he endured before liberation. When he was very young, his parents died, and he was helpless, starving and freezing. The Communist Party liberated the Tibetan people, giving him clothes and food, and the Party sent him to the Central Institute for Nationalities to study. He thought that the Taiwanese compatriots must also be living a life worse than animals, just like he did in the old society. He was determined to liberate the Taiwanese compatriots, and he asked the Party to approve his request to join the army and go to the front to severely strike at the American aggressors. Associate Professor Hu Xianjin of the Cultural Relics Room also requested to serve at the front. In addition to the students in the Political Department, especially the freshmen, requesting to join the army themselves, some also wrote letters to their families, mobilizing their family members to join the army. "We will never give up until Taiwan is liberated!" Now the work-study personnel are full of confidence, determined, and energetic. They wrote big-character posters and slogans all night long, and made small flags. The comrades in the library worked hard all night, exhibiting materials and pictures of American imperialism's aggression against China on the morning of the 7th. The students in Preparatory Department I wrote and rehearsed a living newspaper overnight, which was performed on the 7th.
                                      The Entire Central Institute for Nationalities
    After hearing Premier Zhou's statement on the territorial sea of the People's Republic of China and the statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region, we minority students took to the streets with excitement to demonstrate and protest against the aggression of American imperialism. We will never tolerate this aggressive behavior of American imperialism and will certainly resist the provocations of American imperialism with practical actions!

    个个磨拳擦掌　纷纷要求参军
    少数民族人民决心保卫祖国
    我们从广播中听到周总理的声明后，大家表示坚决拥护周总理的声明，并用自己的实际行动来回击美帝国主义的武装挑衅。语文系高山族教员林春青对美帝国主义武装侵略我国非常气愤，他回忆过去日本帝国主义杀死了他的父母，而今天美帝国主义还蹂躏台湾同胞，他听到周总理声明一定要解放台湾，他感动得哭了，他坚决要求参军到前线作战。预科二部藏族学生一听说解放台湾，个个磨拳擦掌，纷纷要求参军，要把课堂上听到的为人民服务的道理，变成自己的实际行动。藏族学生普布回想起他在解放前所受的痛苦，在他很小的时候，他的父母就死了，他无依无靠，挨饿受冻，共产党解放了藏族人民，送给他衣服、粮食，党又把他送到中央民族学院学习，他想台湾同胞也必然过着像他在过去旧社会一样的牛马不如的生活，他立志要解放台湾同胞，他要求党批准他参军到前线狠狠地打击美国侵略军。文物室副教授胡先晋也要求到前线服务。政治系学生特别是新生除本人要求参军外，有的还向家中写信，动员自己的家属参军。“不解放台湾，决不罢休！”现在学工人员信心足，决心大，干劲冲天，连夜写大字报，贴标语，做小旗，图书馆同志苦战一夜，在7日早晨展出美帝国主义侵略中国的资料和图片。预科一部学生连夜编写排练活报剧，7日即演出。
                                      中央民族学院全体
    听到周总理关于中华人民共和国的领海的声明和关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明以后，我们少数民族同学以激动的心情走到大街进行示威游行，抗议美帝国主义的侵略。我们决不容忍美帝国主义的这种侵略行为，一定用实际行动反抗美帝国主义的挑衅！
