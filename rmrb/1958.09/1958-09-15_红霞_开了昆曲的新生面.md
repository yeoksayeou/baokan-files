    "Red Glow" Opens a New Chapter for Kunqu Opera
    Ouyang Yuqian
    Many people believe that Kunqu opera has great difficulty reflecting modern life. Difficulties exist, but as long as we can break with conventions, we can overcome these difficulties and make this ancient art serve today and socialist construction. The North Kunqu Opera Theater's performance of "Red Glow" answers this question.
    "Red Glow" is the first opera to use Kunqu to reflect modern life. It successfully depicts the brutal class struggle and the heroic image of Communist Party members. The first shot has been fired successfully, opening up a new path, and congratulations are in order.
    Kunqu opera has a history of about four hundred years from its formation to the present. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were its golden age, and it has gradually declined over the past hundred years. Although there are still a very small number of people who are interested in Kunqu opera, it is difficult to gain the support and love of the masses.
    The reason for the decline of Kunqu opera lies in its own limitations, which prevent it from keeping up with the progress of the times and meeting the requirements of the masses. Therefore, if we want to preserve it, we must give it new development, so that it can take root anew among the broad masses, sprout tender seedlings, and bloom flowers more beautiful and fragrant than in the past. This requires solving a series of problems and carrying out reforms: From the perspective of the structure of the script, we are happy to accept the traditional method of scriptwriting that is complete and has a beginning and an end, but the formulaic rules of the "chuanqi" (classical drama) must be broken. In order to highlight the theme, the story must be narrated concisely and succinctly, and the plot arranged; the characters must be introduced forcefully. A play should be performed in no more than three and a half hours, as a longer performance would be too burdensome for the audience. Whether the new Kunqu opera is adapted from existing scripts or a new script is created, it must refer to the composition methods of bangzi opera, Peking opera, as well as spoken drama and new opera to divide the play into acts and scenes, and arrange the singing and dialogue. One of the main reasons for the success of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is that it can focus on narrating the story, introducing the characters, highlighting the theme, and explaining the problem. In order to do this, the original work must be abridged (even removing or changing some of the plot). Therefore, the scenes have to be changed, and the suites, modes, the length of the tunes, and the tempo must all be changed accordingly, and the lyrics must also be changed – that is, the original work must be disassembled and reorganized, and some new elements added. The Kunqu opera "Red Glow" is adapted from a new opera, and of course it is not restricted by zaju (a form of Chinese opera) or chuanqi. But without the determination and courage to break with conventions and eliminate superstitions, when it comes to Kunqu opera, there may still be concerns about the rules and regulations. The directors and writers of Kunqu opera "Red Glow" have transcended all the rules of Kunqu opera. This is the right thing to do. If this had not been done, the rapid performance of "Red Glow" would not have been possible.
    After seeing the play, some people asked: "Is this Kunqu opera, or new opera?" Others said: "The play is very good, but the flavor of Kunqu opera is too weak." If you want to listen to pure Kunqu opera, this play is not satisfying enough; for reflecting the revolutionary reality, this play is successful. We cannot imagine that a play like "Red Glow" can use a certain set of tunes or certain collected tunes; nor can we imagine that in such a play, sections of "sanyanban" (a type of musical pattern) are sung one after another. We must decide on the form based on the content of the play, and not distort the content to suit the form. Forms that are not suitable for expressing the content should not be adopted or should be transformed to suit the new content. The composer of Kunqu opera "Red Glow" attempted to create new tunes based on the original Kunqu opera; one of the tunes was developed from the "Miandaxu" tune; another tune was developed based on "Shanpo Yang". The limitations of the tune patterns must be broken, and it is entirely appropriate to compose new tunes for new content. Even if a certain tune pattern is used as a basis, because the thoughts and feelings of the characters and the specific situation of the play are different, it is impossible to completely maintain the original style. Therefore, the "Miandaxu" in "Red Glow" is no longer the original "Miandaxu", and the "Shanpo Yang" is no longer the original "Shanpo Yang", which is easy to understand.
    The autumn harvest scene in the Soviet area used Jiangxi folk songs. It is precedented to add folk songs to Kunqu opera: the Wu songs in "Dawei" and the mountain songs in "Quannong" are all natural. Even if there is no precedent, it can be created independently. The main thing is to see whether it is necessary to express the theme. Take what is needed and discard what is not.
    Kunqu opera once integrated the best of both northern and southern tunes. The genius creations of Wei Liangfu, Liang Bolong, and others made it a genre that was once extremely popular. Kunqu opera's tunes are very rich. Both singing and dancing have unique achievements. But it originated in the city, and in its development it has always catered to the tastes of the literati and senior intellectuals. The attitude strives to be gentle and sincere, the script strives to be elegant and ornate, the dance strives to be graceful and beautiful, the expression strives to be delicate and appropriate, and the singing strives to be clear and beautiful. The leisure class used this for their entertainment. The elegant spoken dialogue does not seek to be understood by the masses; the slow tempo also fits their lifestyle. As long as the tune is sung melodiously and gracefully, they shake their heads and make a look of being deeply moved, without thinking about anything else. In the past, the vast majority of wealthy merchants followed the literati and cultivated elegance. Although the general public did not understand the lyrics, they were still easily satisfied by listening to the tunes and watching the plot. As for the broad masses, they liked Yiyang opera, Qinqiang opera, or Peking opera. The rise of "Hua Department" (a general term for local operas) led to the decline of Kunqu opera, which could not be reversed by a small number of people with a special preference.
    Now we are absorbing the essence of Kunqu opera on one hand and refining it; at the same time, we are injecting new blood; we want to rejuvenate this ancient genre. Adapting and performing plays that reflect modern life is the most effective way. Doing so can make it breathe with today's broad masses and keep pace with the rhythm of the new era. As long as this step is taken, there will be no more difficulties in adapting historical stories.
    We can say with certainty that the performance of "Red Glow" has great significance in the history of opera. It is gratifying to see such a declining genre transformed to serve the people. For Kunqu opera itself, it is also gratifying to be able to remove all morbid elements, better develop its advantages, and live more healthily.
    Now I would like to raise a few questions for reference:
    Kunqu opera is an opera and must pay attention to singing skills. "Red Glow" does this right. It has many singing sections, which are arranged quite appropriately to the plot and can express the emotions of the characters. The lyrics use colloquial language, which makes it easier to understand – this seems simple, but it takes a lot of effort to overcome many difficulties, and it is not very easy. It is not easy to understand every sentence of the lyrics of an opera, and listeners do not expect to understand everything perfectly. But while appreciating the singing, it is best to also appreciate the lyrics. If you can't understand what is being sung at all, it will affect your understanding of the play. Many of the original Kunqu opera lyrics are incomprehensible even if subtitles are provided. It is of great significance that the lyrics have been changed to colloquial language.
    In Kunqu opera, each act often begins and ends with "sanban" (unmetered rhythm). It is rare to put sanban in the middle of a tune with a meter. "Red Glow" does this. Kunqu opera's sanban are all slow, unlike Peking opera's sanban, which can be freely fast or slow. Peking opera's sanban can express tense and intense emotions, but Kunqu opera's sanban cannot. In "Red Glow," when Qingshan and Zhao Zhigang meet in the second act, Zhao sings a "yiban" (moderate tempo), and Qingshan follows with a sanban, and the play immediately feels loose. Some people say that the singing is loose, but in fact, Kunqu opera's sanban does not sing tightly. A tense sanban has not yet been created in Kunqu opera. Should we consider changing Qingshan's two sanban sections to "yiban"?
    Kunqu opera's singing pays special attention to articulation and vowel endings, but because of the way the melody is performed, the initial consonants and vowels are often far apart, and one word often sounds like three words. The original intention was to make it easier to hear clearly, but the result is that it is even more difficult to hear clearly. "Red Glow" has changed to use the pronunciation methods of Peking opera and folk art forms, making the lyrics sound closer to the spoken language, which is very good. Therefore, the way of singing cannot but change accordingly. It goes without saying that the charm will also change, and this should be regarded as one of the new practices of the new Kunqu opera.
    Peking opera uses both "yunbai" (verse dialogue) and "jingbai" (Beijing dialect), and Kunqu opera uses both "yunbai" and Suzhou dialect. "Red Glow" uses standard Beijing dialect. Could more effort be put into making it an artistic language with some intonation?
    Singing and dancing are the characteristics of Chinese opera. Indeed, extremely rich ancient Chinese dance art is preserved in opera. It is seamlessly integrated into the performance movements and flexibly applied according to the plot and character of the characters, and it is never dance for the sake of dance (this is very important), so it appears extremely natural. It can be said that the dance movements in Chinese opera are lifelike. Now some plays forcibly add some dance movements, which look unusually stiff, which is inappropriate. Especially when performing plays with modern themes, it is absolutely forbidden to make fancy movements when holding a rifle. It is good that "Red Glow" 's performance does not stiffly transplant the dance movements of opera. According to the director's intention (I think), the ribbon dance in the prologue is symbolic. But it does not explain the problem, it seems redundant, and it is not in harmony with the style of the whole play. Can it be deleted? In the autumn harvest scene in the second act, one person is holding a dustpan, and the rest are dancing empty-handed, is it still worth studying?
    The scale of the orchestra has been expanded, and new arrangements have been made for the orchestration. This also breaks with the conventions of Kunqu opera and is a progress. At the beginning of the last act, the large suona horn is used to play "Ku Pi" (a sorrowful tune) to symbolize the enemy's despair. At that time, I felt that the momentum was huge and there was a tragic feeling, but the music at the close felt insufficient. Can we study it and make appropriate adjustments?
    The above are some of my thoughts after watching the Kunqu opera "Red Glow". I have only seen it once, and my discussion is not comprehensive enough or in-depth enough, and I have not finished everything I wanted to say, but I have already taken up too much space, so I will end here.

### “红霞”开了昆曲的新生面

    “红霞”开了昆曲的新生面
    欧阳予倩
    人多认为昆曲反映现代生活有很大的困难。困难是有的，但只要能打破陈规，就能克服困难，使古老的艺术为今天、为社会主义建设服务。北昆剧院“红霞”的演出回答了这个问题。
    “红霞”是用昆曲反映现代生活的第一个戏。它成功地描绘了残酷的阶级斗争和共产党员的英雄形象。第一炮打响了，也就是打开了一条路，应当致以祝贺。
    昆曲从形成到现在约有四百年的历史，十七、十八世纪是它的全盛时期，近百余年来逐渐衰败。现在尽管也还有极少数人对昆曲感兴趣，但已很难得到广大群众的支持与爱好。
    昆曲之所以衰败，由于它本身的许多限制，不能随着时代的进展、配合群众的要求。因此，如果要保存它就必须使它有新的发展，使它从新在广大群众中扎下根去，发出嫩苗，开出比过去更美丽芬芳的花朵。这就得解决一系列的问题，进行改革：从剧本的结构来看，我们乐于接受源源本本、有头有尾的传统的编剧方法，但传奇的程式法则必须打破。为着突出主题思想，必须集中地、简练地叙述故事，安排情节；有力地介绍人物。一个戏最长要在三个半小时以内演完，超过这个长度观众的负担就太重。新的昆剧无论是根据原有的剧本改编或者编制新的剧本，必须参考梆子、皮黄以及话剧、新歌剧的编制方法来分幕分场，安排唱白。“十五贯”之所以成功，其主要条件之一就因为它能集中地叙述故事，介绍人物，突出主题思想，说明问题。为了要这样做，便不能不将原作加以删节（甚至去掉或改掉一部分情节）。因此，场子就不能不改，套数、宫调、曲子的长短、节拍的快慢等等都不能不随着有所变更，词句也得改动——也就是将原作拆开来从新组织过，并加进一些新的东西。昆剧“红霞”是根据新歌剧改编的，当然可以不受杂剧或传奇的限制。但如果没有打破陈规、破除迷信的决心和勇气，谈到昆曲也很可能对格律有所顾虑。昆剧“红霞”的编导是超脱了昆曲一切格律的。这样做是对的。如果不这样做“红霞”的迅速演出是不可能的。
    看过戏之后，有人问：“这是昆剧呢，还是新歌剧？”还有人说：“戏很不错，但昆曲的味道太少了。”若为听纯粹的昆曲，这个戏是不够过瘾的；为着反映革命的现实，这个戏是成功的。我们不可能想像：“红霞”这样的戏可用某一套曲子或用某些集曲；也不可能想像在这样的戏里一段一段的三眼板接替着唱下去。我们要根据剧的内容来决定形式，不能迁就形式而歪曲内容。不适宜表现内容的形式只有不采用或加以改造使之适合于新的内容。昆剧“红霞”的作曲者企图在昆曲原有的基础上作出新的曲子；其中有一个曲子是从“绵搭絮”这个曲牌发展的；另一个曲子是用“山坡羊”为基础发展的。曲牌的限制必须打破，为新的内容作新曲完全是应当的。即使用某个曲牌为基础，因为人物的思想感情和戏的规定情景的不同，决不可能完全保持原来的风格。所以“红霞”里的“绵搭絮”已经不是原来的“绵搭絮”、“山坡羊”也不是原来的“山坡羊”了，这是易于理解的。
    苏区秋收一场用了江西民歌。昆剧里加唱民歌本有先例：“打围”里的吴歌，“劝农”里的山歌，都很自然。就是没有先例也可独创。主要看为着表达主题思想是不是需要。要的就拿过来，不要的便剔开去。
    昆曲一度集南北曲调之大成，魏良辅，梁伯龙等的天才创造，使它成为一个曾盛极一时的剧种。昆曲的曲调是非常丰富的。歌和舞都有独特的成就。但它产生在都市，它在发展中一直是配合着士大夫和高级知识分子的口胃的。态度力求温柔敦厚，剧文力求典雅富丽，舞姿力求圆润华美，表情力求细腻熨贴，唱腔力求清俏柔丽。有闲阶级借此以供视听之娱，文雅的唱白并不求大众能懂；缓慢的节拍也正合他们的生活情调。只要曲子唱得悠扬宛转，便摇头?脑、做出回肠荡气的样子，并不想到别的。过去的富商大贾绝大多数跟随士大夫之后，附庸风雅；一般市民虽不懂得唱词，听听曲子，看看情节，在过去也还是容易满足。至于广大群众却欢喜弋阳腔，秦腔或皮黄。“花部”兴起，昆曲就冷落下去，这不是少数偏爱的人所能挽回的。
    现在我们一面吸取昆曲的精华，加以提炼；同时注入新的血液；要使这个古老的剧种返老还童。编演反映现代生活的戏是最有效的办法。这样做就能使它和今天的广大群众通呼吸，同新时代的生活节奏合拍。只要这一步走通了，搬演历史故事就更没有困难。
    我们肯定地说：“红霞”的演出在戏曲史上有重大的意义。使这样一个已经衰败的剧种经过改造为人民服务是可喜的事。就昆曲本身来说，使它能去掉一切病态更好地发挥优点，更健康地活下去也是可喜的事。
    现在我想提出几个问题以供参考：
    昆剧是歌剧，必须注重唱工，“红霞”在这方面做得对。它有许多段唱，都安排得相当适合剧情，能够表达人物的情感。唱词用了口语，这就比较容易听懂——这一点看起来似乎简单，做起来却要克服许多困难，并不十分容易。歌剧的唱词求其句句听懂很不容易，听歌的也不作百分之百的要求。但是一面欣赏唱工，最好一面也能欣赏文词。如果完全听不出唱的是甚么也会影响对戏的理解。原来昆曲的唱词有许多就是打出字幕来也看不懂。唱词改用口语是有重大意义的。
    昆剧每折戏往往开始和结尾唱散板。把散板夹在上板的曲子当中的很少。“红霞”却是这样做了。昆曲的散板都是缓慢的，不像京戏的散板那样快慢自由。京戏的散板可以表达紧张激烈的感情，昆曲的散板就办不到。“红霞”第二幕青山和赵志刚见面一场，赵唱一眼板，青山接唱散板，立刻就感觉戏松了。有人说唱的松了，实际是昆曲的散板唱不紧。昆曲中紧张的散板还没创造出来。青山的两段散板是否可以考虑改唱一眼板呢？
    昆曲的唱工对出字归音异常讲究，可是因为行腔的原故，声母和韵母往往距离得很远，一个字往往听起来像三个字。原来的用意本为了容易听清，结果却弄得更不容易听清。“红霞”改用了京戏和曲艺的吐字方法，使唱词听起来比较接近语言，这样做很好。因此唱曲的方法也不可能不随着而有所更变。韵味也会起变化自不用说，这应看作新昆曲的新作法之一。
    京剧韵白与京白并用，昆剧韵白与苏白并用，“红霞”用的是普通北京话，是不是可以更多的加点工使成为有些腔调的艺术语言呢？
    载歌载舞是中国戏曲的特点。的确，在戏曲当中保存着极为丰富的中国古代的舞蹈艺术。“天衣无缝”地融汇在表演动作里面，随着剧情和人物性格灵活地加以运用，从不为舞蹈而舞蹈（这一点非常重要），所以显得极其自如。可以说中国戏曲里的舞蹈动作是生活化了的。现在有些戏勉强加些舞蹈动作，看上去异常生硬，这是不妥当的。尤其演现代题材的戏，拿步枪要个甚么花千万使不得。“红霞”的表演没有生硬地搬用戏曲的舞蹈动作是好的。根据导演的意图（我这样想）序幕里的舞绸是带象征性的。但不能说明问题，看起来似乎多余，而且同全剧的风格不调和。是否可以删去？第二幕秋收那场一个人拿着簸箕，其余的人都空手而舞，是不是还可以研究一下。
    乐队的规模扩大了，配器有新的安排，这也打破了昆曲的陈规，是一个进步。最后一幕开场用大唢呐吹“哭皮”以象征敌人的走入绝路，我当时听了感觉得声势浩大有悲壮之感，而闭幕时的音乐又还感觉力量不够。是不是可以研究一下，作适当的调整？
    以上是我看了昆剧“红霞”的一些感想。我只看过一次，谈得不够全面，也不深入，话也没有说完、说透，占的篇幅已经多了，就此结束吧。
