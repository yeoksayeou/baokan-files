    Hydraulic Press
    A hydraulic press is a type of forging machinery. It uses pressure to press metal into the required shape in a hot state, making its internal structure more compact and uniform, and improving its mechanical strength. In machines and equipment such as rolling mills, hoists, hydro and thermal power station equipment, vertical lathes, diesel engines, ships, electric shovels, and sugar making machines, parts that bear large external forces, such as shafts, impellers, large gears, rotors, crankshafts, and hooks, all need to be forgings.
    There are two types of hydraulic presses. One type does not use specially shaped forging dies during forging, but forges the billet on an anvil, called a free forging hydraulic press; the other type uses a certain shape of forging die during forging, so that the flow of metal during forging is restricted by the grooves in the forging die, called a die forging hydraulic press.
    When the hydraulic press is working, high-pressure water is pumped from a nearby high-pressure water pump and enters the main cylinder through a conduit. There is a plunger in the main cylinder, and the upper part of the plunger bears the pressure. The plunger is pressed down by the force, and the moving crossbeam and upper anvil are pressed down, while the lower anvil is stationary. The billet to be processed is placed on the lower anvil, and the upper anvil presses down to apply pressure to the billet, which is forging.
    The hydraulic press is a heavy-duty piece of equipment, and it is also a collaborative operation device. Commonly used hydraulic presses range from 600 tons to 15,000 tons. The capacity of the hydraulic press is expressed by the total pressure of the upper anvil pressing down. A 1,000-ton hydraulic press can forge an 8-ton steel ingot.

    水压机
    水压机是一种锻压机械。它用压力将金属在热状态下，压制成要求的形状，并使它的内部组织更加紧密均匀，提高机械强度。在轧钢机、卷扬机、水力和火力电站设备、立式车床、柴油机、船舶，电铲、制糖机等机器设备中，承受外力大的零件，如轴、叶轮、大齿轮、转子、曲轴、吊钩等，都要用锻件。
    水压机有两种。一种在锻造时不用特殊形状的锻模，把坯料放在砧子上锻造，叫自由锻造水压机；另一种在锻造时用一定形状的锻模，使金属在锻造时的流动，受到锻模里槽子的限制，叫模锻水压机。
    水压机工作的时候，从旁边的高压水泵打来高压的水，顺着导管进入主缸，主缸里有一个柱塞，柱塞上部就承受了压力。柱塞受力往下压，就把移动横梁和上砧压下，下砧是不动的。要加工的坯料放在下砧上，上砧压下来，就把坯料加压，这就是锻造了。
    水压机是一个重型设备，又是一个联合作业的设备。常用的水压机是六百吨到一万五千吨。水压机的能力，是上砧向下压的总压力来表示的。一台一千吨的水压机，能锻八吨重的钢锭。
