Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, September 27th. The delegation of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association issued a statement in Hong Kong on the 26th after arriving, accusing the United States of invading China's territory of Taiwan and interfering in China's internal affairs, and condemning the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government for following the United States' war policy and helping the United States carry out war provocations against the Chinese people.

The statement pointed out: The cause of the current tense situation in Taiwan is due to the war policy of the United States. The only way to resolve the current tense situation is for the United States military to completely withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area.

The statement said: The United States' military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area and the fact that Japan is being used as a military base for launching wars have harmed Japan's independence, caused disasters to the Japanese people, threatened peace in Asia, and constituted interference in China's internal affairs.

The statement concluded: The Japanese people resolutely oppose Kishi Nobusuke's active participation in the US military provocations against the People's Republic of China, oppose the United States using Japan as a base for launching wars, and resolutely express their determination to fight for the withdrawal of US troops from Japan and Asia.

The head of the delegation, Jiichiro Matsumoto, Chairman of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, also told Hong Kong newspaper reporters that it is doubtful whether the United States is sincere in peacefully resolving the disputes between China and the United States. He pointed out that if the United States is sincere in promptly easing the situation in the Taiwan Strait, it should immediately withdraw all its troops from Taiwan.

Matsumoto Jiichiro refuted the remarks made by Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama at the UN General Assembly, which showed that the Kishi Nobusuke government was fully acting as the main accomplice of US aggression. He said: "We, the Japanese people, completely oppose his speech." He pointed out that the joint communiqué recently issued by Aiichiro Fujiyama and Dulles, which openly slandered China for using force to create a tense situation in the Taiwan Strait, is completely inconsistent with the facts.

Referring to the "two Chinas" policy pursued by the Kishi Nobusuke government, Matsumoto Jiichiro said: The Japanese people firmly believe that there is only one China, which is the People's Republic of China. This policy of the Kishi Nobusuke government will inevitably drag the Japanese people into war, and therefore will inevitably be firmly opposed by the Japanese people. He also condemned the Japanese government for supporting the United States' position in unreasonably delaying the resolution of the issue of China's representation at the United Nations General Assembly. He said: This once again exposed the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile attitude towards China.

The delegation is scheduled to leave Hong Kong for Beijing today.

    日中友协访华代表团在香港发表声明
    美国如有谈判诚意应把军队撤出台湾
    岸政府当侵略者帮凶受到日本人民坚决反对
    新华社香港27日电  日中友好协会访华代表团26日到达香港后发表声明，指责美国侵略中国的领土台湾和干涉中国的内政，并且谴责日本岸信介政府追随美国的战争政策和帮助美国对中国人民进行战争挑衅。
    声明指出：造成目前台湾紧张局势的原因是由于美国的战争政策。解决目前这种紧张局势的方法，除了美国军队完全撤出台湾和台湾海峡地区之外，是没有别的方法的。
    声明说：美国在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅行动和日本被利用为发动战争的军事基地这样的事实伤害了日本的独立，使日本人民遭受灾难和威胁了亚洲的和平，并且造成了对中国内政的干涉。
    声明最后说：日本人民坚决反对日本岸信介积极参加美国对中华人民共和国的军事挑衅行动，反对美国利用日本作为发动战争的基地，并且坚决表示要为美国军队撤出日本和亚洲地区而斗争。
    代表团团长、日中友好协会会长松本治一郎同时还向香港报纸记者发表谈话说：美国是否有诚意来和平解决中美两国之间的争端是很可疑的。他指出：要是美国有诚意及时和缓台湾海峡地区的局势，那么它就应该马上把所有军队撤出台湾。
    松本治一郎驳斥了日本外务相藤山爱一郎在联大会议上发表的表明岸信介政府全面充当美国侵略的主要帮凶的谈话。他说：“我们日本人民完全反对他的发言。”他指出：藤山爱一郎和杜勒斯最近发表的联合公报中公开诬蔑中国使用武力造成了台湾海峡地区的紧张局势的说法，是完全不符合事实的。
    谈到岸信介政府所执行的“两个中国”的政策时，松本治一郎说：日本人民坚决认为中国只有一个，这就是中华人民共和国。岸信介政府这种政策不可避免地会把日本人民拖进战争中去，因此必然遭受日本人民的坚决反对。他还指责了日本政府支持美国在联合国大会上无理拖延解决中国代表权问题的提案的立场。他说：这又一次暴露了岸信介政府敌视中国的态度。
    代表团定于今天离香港前往北京。
