Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: In the battle to severely punish Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous troops, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front demonstrated a high degree of communist spirit and revolutionary heroism. Many vivid facts prove that the people's army, led by the Communist Party and armed with Marxism-Leninism, loyal to the motherland and the cause of peace, will always be an invincible armed force.

    Since the start of the battle to punish Chiang's bandit troops in late August, all officers and soldiers on the Fujian front have been in high spirits and full of enthusiasm, writing to their superiors to request combat missions. Some personnel on leave rushed back to their units overnight, and pilots hospitalized due to illness requested early discharge. Cadres who had been scheduled for demobilization requested to "leave after the battle is over." Veterans requested an extension of their service period. Some comrades postponed their originally scheduled wedding dates in order to participate in the battle. After receiving orders, the units completed combat preparations in a very short period of time. The frontline artillery and infantry braved strong winds, heavy rain, and scorching sun, working day and night to reinforce fortifications. Sweat and rain soaked their clothes countless times, and the scorching sun dried them countless times; their eyes were bloodshot, and their palms were blistered, but everyone's morale remained very high.

    Motor vehicle drivers braved the wind, rain, and enemy fire, transporting ammunition and equipment day and night on the winding and undulating frontline roads. Frontline observers vigilantly monitored the enemy day and night. Signalmen erected and repaired lines under enemy fire, ensuring smooth communication and liaison on the front. Air force personnel expressed: In order to defend the motherland's airspace, "We will strike wherever we are directed." Ground crew said, "We can skip meals and sleep, but the planes must be prepared on time!" Every officer and soldier contributed their utmost strength to the victory of the battle.

    In combat against the enemy, frontline officers and soldiers were brave, tenacious, resourceful, and flexible in the air, on land, and at sea, striking hard and accurately. Zhao De'an, battalion commander of an air force unit, led a squadron of aircraft in an aerial battle on July 29th, using a force of four against four to shoot down and damage three enemy aircraft. Pilot Gao Changji tracked and pursued an enemy aircraft until he was only 169.5 meters away before opening fire, shooting down the enemy aircraft with a single attack. In the aerial battle on September 8th, pilot Zhang Yilin discovered two enemy aircraft attempting to attack him stealthily. He calmly used a tactic of suddenly reducing speed, placing the enemy aircraft under his own fire, and then relentlessly pursued and shot down the enemy aircraft accurately from an altitude of 8,000 meters down to 300 meters. In naval battles, our valiant torpedo boat units deserve to be called demolition experts on the sea. Zhang Yimin, Chief of Staff of a torpedo boat unit, bravely led the torpedo boats against strong winds, huge waves, and fierce enemy fire during the night of September 1st. He only ordered the launch of torpedoes when he was only 180 meters away from the enemy warship, accurately hitting the enemy warship. In the battle to sink and damage two enemy "Zhong" class warships, enemy shore batteries and enemy boats fired fiercely at us. He bravely steered the command boat away, drawing the enemy's fire, and deployed smoke screens to cover the attack of other boats, sinking the enemy warship. Our powerful artillery units were even more brave and tenacious, fighting continuously, giving the enemy heavy blows time and time again with accurate firepower. In order not to give the enemy a chance to breathe, they fired quickly, fiercely, and accurately during the battle. Jiang Chuanzhang, deputy platoon leader of a certain unit's first company, stood motionless at the issuing post to continue directing the firing, even when enemy shells landed around the position and shrapnel flew over his head, in order to uninterruptedly command the firing. Wu Qichang, deputy gunner of the second company of a certain unit, discovered that there were not many shells left when he received an order to switch from constant-speed firing to rapid firing. He immediately mobilized everyone to carry shells. He himself was a hundred times more courageous, aiming, changing shells, and firing, all in one breath, firing more than 40 rounds, ensuring the successful completion of the combat mission.

    No difficulties in the battle could daunt our heroic soldiers. In the naval battle on August 24th, the torpedo men of a certain torpedo boat worked all night in the engine room at nearly 70 degrees Celsius in order to troubleshoot. In order to maintain the highest speed during the attack, young communist party member Zhao Liqi and others unhesitatingly climbed onto the machine at 80 degrees Celsius to push open the wrench. All the crew members also overcame one difficulty after another in the high-temperature engine room, ensuring the victory of the battle and earning a collective second-class merit.

    Officers and soldiers, and various units, closely united and cooperated with each other in the battle, demonstrating the people's army's high degree of class love and collectivist spirit. In the battle on August 26th, Wei Shuhua, a soldier of the second artillery company, was wounded in the head. Instructor Liu Yuzhen immediately went to see him from the issuing post. Just as he arrived near the gun position, a shell exploded nearby. At this time, the already wounded Wei Shuhua immediately pressed the instructor to the ground, using his own body to shield the instructor. When the fourth artillery company of a certain unit was fiercely bombarding Chiang's troops and urgently needed to replenish ammunition, the company commander and instructor of the third infantry company of a certain unit personally led the entire company to the artillery position, working wholeheartedly for six hours, replenishing the ammunition sufficiently and helping the fourth company to reinforce the fortifications.

    In the face of such heroic troops, in the face of these soldiers with a high degree of political awareness, any enemy's aggression and adventurism will be completely crushed.

    严惩蒋贼  威震美帝
    福建前线指战员英勇无比
    在空中飞将军痛歼敌机亦智亦勇
    在陆地神炮手摧毁敌阵百发百中
    在海洋鱼雷艇追击敌舰又猛又准
    新华社28日讯  在严厉惩罚蒋介石卖国军队的战斗中，中国人民解放军福建前线全体指战员，表现了高度的共产主义风格和革命英雄主义气概，许多生动事实证明，由共产党领导的用马列主义思想武装起来的忠于祖国、忠于和平事业的人民军队，永远是一支攻无不克，战无不胜的武装力量。
    从8月下旬惩罚蒋贼军的战斗开始以来，福建前线全体官兵斗志高昂，群情奋发，纷纷上书要求上级给予战斗任务。有的休假的人员，连夜兼程赶回部队，因病住院的飞行员要求提前出院。已经确定转业的干部，要求“打完仗再走”。老兵要求延长服役期限。有的同志为了参加战斗，推迟了原定的结婚日期。各部队接到命令之后，在极短的时间内完成了战斗准备。前线炮兵和步兵冒着狂风、大雨和烈日，日夜不停地加修工事，汗水和雨水无数次地把衣服淋湿，烈日又无数次地把衣服烤干；眼睛熬红了，手掌起泡了，大家的情绪依然十分高涨。
    汽车驾驶员们冒着风雨和敌人的炮火，在曲折起伏的前线公路上，日夜不停地运输弹药和器材。前线观察兵们，不分昼夜，警惕地监视着敌人。通信兵们在敌人的炮火下架设和抢修线路，保证前线的通信联络畅通无阻。空军部队的空勤人员表示：为了保卫祖国领空，“指到哪里，打到哪里”。地勤人员说：“饭可不吃，觉可不睡，飞机一定要按时准备好！”每一个官兵，都为了战斗的胜利贡献出自己的一切力量。
    在对敌作战中，前线官兵无论在天空、陆地和海洋上，都是英勇顽强、机智灵活，打得又狠又准。空军某部大队长赵德安，在7月29日的一次空战中，率领一个飞机中队，以四对四的兵力一举击落击伤敌机三架。飞行员高长吉一直跟踪追击敌机到距离一百六十九点五公尺时才开炮，只一次攻击就将敌机击落。飞行员张以林在9月8日的空战中，发现两架敌机企图向他偷袭时，他毫不慌张地用突然减低速度的战法，使敌机置于我机攻击之下，接着猛打穷追，从八千公尺一直打到三百公尺高度，准确的击落了敌机。在海上战斗中，我神勇的鱼雷快艇部队，不愧称为海上的爆破手。快艇某部参谋长张逸民，9月1日夜间，指挥快艇冒着大风大浪和敌人的猛烈炮火英勇出击。直到距敌舰只有一百八十多公尺时才命令放雷，准确地击中了敌舰。在击沉击伤两艘中字号敌舰的战斗中，敌人的岸炮和敌艇向我猛烈射击，他勇敢地把指挥艇划开去，把敌人火力吸过来，并施放烟幕，掩护其他艇攻击，将敌舰击沉。我强大的炮兵部队，更是英勇顽强，连续作战，以准确的火力一次又一次地给敌人以沉重的打击。为了不给敌人喘息机会，在战斗中他们打的又快、又猛、又准。某部一连副连长姜传章，为了不间断地指挥射击，当敌人的炮弹落在阵地周围，弹片在头上飞舞时，仍一动不动的站在发令所上，继续指挥射击。某部二连副炮长吴其昌，在接到命令由等速射改打急速射时，发现炮弹不多了，马上动员大家去搬炮弹，他一个人奋勇百倍，又瞄准，又换炮弹，又射击，一气打了四十多发，保证了战斗任务的圆满完成。
    战斗中的任何困难，也难不倒我们的英雄战士。在8月24日的海战中，某鱼雷快艇的雷击兵们，为了排除故障，在将近摄氏七十度的机舱里工作了一夜，在攻击中为了保持最高的速度，年青的共产党员赵礼锜等，毫不犹豫地爬到摄氏八十度的机器上去推开扳手。全体艇员也在高温的机舱中战胜了一个又一个的困难，保证了战斗胜利，荣立集体二等功。
    官兵之间，各部队之间，在战斗中紧密团结，互相协同，表现了人民军队高度的阶级友爱和集体主义精神。在8月26日的战斗中，炮兵二连战士魏淑华头部受伤，指导员刘玉臻立即从发令所去看他，刚到炮位附近，一发炮弹在附近爆炸，这时，已经负伤的魏淑华，立刻把指导员按倒在地下，用自己的身体掩护指导员。某部炮四连正在猛烈轰击蒋军，急需补给弹药时，某步兵三连连长和指导员，亲自带领全连人员来到炮阵地上，全力以赴地干了六个小时，弹药补得足足的，又帮助四连抢修工事。
    在这样的英雄部队面前，在这些有着高度政治觉悟的战士面前，任何敌人的侵略冒险，都将被彻底粉碎。
