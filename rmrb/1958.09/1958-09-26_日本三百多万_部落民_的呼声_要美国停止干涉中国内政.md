Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 25th: The Japan Buraku Liberation League held its 13th National Congress in Tokyo on the 24th and 25th. More than nine hundred representatives of the three million plus "Burakumin" from all over Japan, who still suffer from political and economic discrimination and oppression, attended the conference. They enthusiastically discussed the complete liberation of the "Burakumin." More than six hundred people attended the conference as observers.

The movement direction unanimously adopted by the conference pointed out that all "Burakumin" will strengthen their unity with people of all other strata in Japan and launch a movement to support democracy and oppose the revival of militarism in order to fundamentally change Japan's current unconstitutional politics and society.

The conference passed an emergency protest condemning the United States' armed provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait area, demanding that the United States immediately withdraw all its troops from all areas of Asia, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs. The conference immediately dispatched Standing Central Committee member Hideo Miyamoto and other representatives to deliver the protest letter to the U.S. Embassy in Japan.

The conference passed five resolutions. One of them was: Opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China and following the United States in pursuing Japan's nuclear armament policy aimed at China, demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government immediately restore normal diplomatic relations with China.

    要美国停止干涉中国内政
    据新华社25日讯  东京消息：日本部落解放同盟24日和25日两天在东京举行第十三届全国大会。至今还在政治上和经济上受着歧视和压迫的日本各地三百多万“部落民”的九百多名代表参加了大会。他们热烈讨论了“部落民”的完全解放的问题。有六百多人参加大会旁听。
    大会一致通过的运动方针指出，全体“部落民”将加强同日本其他各阶层人民的团结，展开拥护民主、反对复活军国主义的运动，以便从根本上改变违反宪法的日本目前的政治和社会。
    大会通过一项紧急抗议，谴责美国在台湾海峡地区对中国的武装挑衅，要求美国立即从亚洲所有地区撤出一切军队，并且停止对中国内政的干涉。大会立即派遣常任中央委员宫本秀男等代表把抗议书交给了美国驻日本大使馆。
    大会通过了五项决议。其中一项是：反对岸信介政府的敌视中国、追随美国推行以中国为对象的日本的核武装的政策，要求岸信介政府立即恢复同中国的正常邦交。
