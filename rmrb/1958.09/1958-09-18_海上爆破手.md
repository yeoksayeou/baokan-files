Our valiant torpedo boat force is quite like the demolition squads of the war years. A demolition expert must possess the greatest courage, deliver the explosives in the shortest possible time, at the fastest speed, and destroy the enemy's bunkers; and our torpedo boat force is exactly like that, they must muster a spirit of dauntlessness, launch the torpedoes in the shortest possible time, at the fastest speed, at the closest range, and destroy the enemy ships.

In the naval battle on the night of September 1st, the No. 1 boat commanded by Captain Dong Fucai bravely carried out a torpedo attack on the enemy ship, just like a demolition expert.

That day, it was a moonlit night, and the waves roared at sea. The fast boat force advanced at high speed against the force five gale. Dong Fucai's No. 1 boat was at the front of the flotilla, tossing up and down, like a car falling into potholes. The young captain, with his legs apart, stood on the command platform, holding the rudder with one hand and gripping the handle with the other, his eyes fixed on the front, desperately maneuvering this bucking boat. The spray hitting the boat stung his eyes like snowflakes. After sailing for a while, a small black dot was suddenly spotted on the starboard side, visible to the naked eye. This was Chiang Kai-shek's "Yong"-class warship, and there was another small black dot directly ahead, Chiang Kai-shek's "Jiang"-class warship. Seeing that the small fast boats were only three nautical miles away from the two enemy ships, the two enemy ships opened fire on them simultaneously. Barrages of shells exploded around the fast boats, red and green tracer rounds flew wildly in front of and behind the boats, and there were also airburst shells, emitting white smoke in the air, exploding with "pēng, pēng" sounds, creating a haze around the fast boats. Dong Fucai completely ignored the enemy's blocking fire, held the helm, and charged straight towards the enemy ship. When he saw the "Jiang"-class warship suddenly turn to starboard, shifting its firepower to other fast boats, his boat also quickly turned to starboard, accelerating to directly attack the "Yong"-class warship, which was larger than the "Jiang"-class. The firepower of the "Yong"-class warship's blockade was fierce, with a dozen cannons of various calibers firing directly at the No. 1 boat. Dong Fucai still ignored it and continued to advance against the wind, waves, and artillery fire. At this time, the gunners on the boat had already prepared to cover the torpedo launch. Torpedo operator Hu Qingxin grabbed the hand of Boatswain Tian Zhenglin, preparing for the "two-tube ready for combat" work. In the engine room, Chief Engineer Yu Shouyun was gripping the control lever, his eyes fixed on the tachometer, gripping the handle and using his feet and shoulders to maintain balance, so as to ensure the stability of the speed. Each of them, fearless of anything, persisted in their operations at their respective posts.

"No launching of torpedoes until we get close to the enemy ship!" This was their common determination. The No. 1 boat continued to charge forward through the wind, waves, and artillery fire. Dong Fucai had already unplugged the torpedo launcher and turned on the red indicator light, his eyes fixed on the enemy ship. As the enemy's beam angle increased, he turned to port, then immediately returned, and the arrow shot straight towards the "Yong"-class warship. When his boat was only a few hundred meters away from the "Yong"-class warship, he gave the order to fire. As soon as the covering fire was fired, he simultaneously pulled the launch lever and released the torpedoes. The enemies on the deck were in chaos for a while, followed by a deep thunder that ripped through the sea and air, and the towering waves of smoke, carrying lightning-like flames, engulfed the enemy ship. And our brave No. 1 boat, at this time, had already released a smokescreen and returned to the mainland like an arrow.

The brave No. 1 boat and its partners wounded both of Chiang Kai-shek's warships in this naval battle. (Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou Front, 17th)

    海上爆破手
    西虹
    我们神勇的鱼雷快艇部队，很有点像过去战争年代的爆破手。一个爆破手，必须有最大的勇敢，在最短的时间，用最快的速度，把炸药送上去，把敌人的碉堡炸毁；而我们的鱼雷快艇部队，也正是这样，必须鼓起大无畏的精神，在最短的时间，用最快的速度，在最近的距离，把鱼雷放出去，把敌舰炸毁。
    9月1日夜里的那次海战，董福才艇长所指挥的一号艇，正是像爆破手一样勇敢地向着敌舰进行鱼雷攻击的。
    那天，是个月明之夜，海上风浪呼啸，快艇部队顶着五级大风浪，高速度地前进着。董福才的一号艇，在艇队的前面，颠颠簸簸甩过来蹲过去，就像汽车掉进坑坑洼洼一样。年轻的艇长，叉开腿，站在指挥台上，一手把舵，一手紧抓把手，两眼注视着前方，拼命驾驭着这只暴跳的艇。打到艇上的浪花，像雪珠一样地打痛了他的眼睛。航行了一段时间，忽然在右舷，发现一个小黑点，肉眼也能看见，这是蒋贼的永字号军舰，正前方还有一个小黑点，是蒋贼的江字号军舰。眼看小小的快艇，距离两只敌舰只剩了三浬，这两只敌舰，便同时向他们开了火。一排排的炮弹，在快艇周围爆炸，红色的，绿色的曳光弹在艇前艇后乱飞，还有空炸炮弹，当空冒白烟，嘭嘭地爆炸，打得快艇周围，一片烟雾。董福才根本不管敌人的封锁炮火，把住舵轮，迎着敌舰直线地冲上去。当他看到江字号军舰忽然打了右舵，火力转向别的快艇，他的艇便也赶快打右舵，加快速度直取比江字号大的永字号军舰。永字号军舰的火力封锁，来势很猛，各种口径的炮有十来门，直接对准一号艇发射。董福才仍然没有理它，继续迎着风浪炮火前进。这时候，艇上的枪炮兵，早已作好了掩护放雷的准备。鱼雷手胡庆新抓着水手长田正林的手，作好了“两管准备战斗”的准备工作。轮机舱里，于寿筠轮机长正握紧操纵杆，眼睛盯着转度表，手抓把手在借着脚蹬和肩扛，使身体平衡，这样来保证航速的稳定。他们每个人，都天不怕地不怕，在各自的岗位上坚持操作。
    “不靠近敌舰不放雷！”这是他们共同的决心。一号艇仍然在风浪和炮火下直冲猛进着。董福才已经拔掉了鱼雷发射器的插头，拧开了红色的指示灯，两眼紧紧地瞄着敌舰，随着扩大敌舷角，他打左舵，马上又回来，箭直向永字号军舰冲去。当他的艇距离永字号军舰只有几百公尺的时候，他才下达开火的命令。掩护炮火一打响，他又同时扳动发射把，放出鱼雷。舱面上的敌人，一时乱作一团，紧接着一声沉雷划破海空，冲天的烟浪挟着闪电般的火焰，把敌舰吞没。而我们勇敢的一号艇，这时候，已经放出烟幕，箭似地向大陆返航了。
    勇敢的一号艇和它的伙伴们，就在这次的海战中，把蒋贼军的两艘军舰，都打伤了。　新华社福州前线17日电）
