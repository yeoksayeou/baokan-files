    Aluminum is a silver-white metal. Its characteristics are light weight, high strength, and good electrical and thermal conductivity.

    Aluminum has a very wide range of uses and occupies an extremely important position in the national economy. It can be applied to national defense, machinery manufacturing, aviation, the electrical industry, and other light industries. Aluminum has good conductivity, second only to copper, and because aluminum is less expensive than copper, it can replace copper in the electrical and power industries to manufacture wires, cables, etc. In addition, aluminum can replace steel to build houses or manufacture cars and other vehicles.

    Aluminum has strong corrosion resistance and does not rust. Aluminum products can be made into various colors such as yellow, purple, blue, and red after oxidation treatment. It can be made into all kinds of small hardware and daily necessities, such as pots, bowls, ladles, basins, all the way to aluminum foil used for packaging candies, cigarettes, etc.

    Currently, the general process for aluminum plants to produce aluminum is to first make alumina from aluminum ore, and then smelt the alumina into aluminum by electrolysis. In the production process, many by-products can also be recovered, such as sulfuric acid, rare metals, etc.

    铝
    铝是一种银白色金属。它的特点是体质轻，强度高，导电、导热好。
    铝的用途非常广泛，在国民经济中占有极其重要的地位。它可以应用于国防、机器制造、航空、电气工业及其他轻工业。铝有较好的导电率，仅次于铜，加以铝的成本比铜低，它就可以代替铜在电器和电力工业上制造电线、电缆等。另外，铝还可以代替钢材用来建筑房屋或制造汽车等车辆。
    铝有很强的抗腐性能，不生锈。铝制品经过氧化处理以后，能制成黄、紫、蓝、红等各种颜色。它可以制成各种各样的小五金和生活用品，如锅、碗、瓢、盆，一直到包装糖果、纸烟等用的铝箔。
    目前一般铝厂生产铝的过程是，先把铝矿制成氧化铝，然后再用电解的方法把氧化铝冶炼成铝。生产过程中，还可以收回很多副产品，如硫酸、稀有金属等。
