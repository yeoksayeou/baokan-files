The people of French West Africa are awakening in large numbers. When De Gaulle went to Dakar, the capital of French West Africa, to peddle his draft "constitution", he was met with demonstrations of protest by the local people. The picture shows two Dakar residents in the protest demonstrations with slogans pasted on their faces, demanding immediate independence for French West Africa.
