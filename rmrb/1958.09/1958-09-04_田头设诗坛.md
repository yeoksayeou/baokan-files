　　Poetry Forums Set Up in the Fields
    The Tong'an County Folk Song Association of Fujian Province recently established "Poetry Forums in the Fields." "Poetry Forums in the Fields" involves hanging blackboards (or other boards) in the fields, placing them in resting areas or at intersections. Anyone who has feelings or wants to write poetry during labor can write directly on the board. The first "Poetry Forum in the Field" was held in Hongtang Township, and this has now become a major part of the Hongtang Township Club's field literary activities. Some of the works that have appeared on the "Poetry Forums in the Fields" are truly magnificent in spirit and beautifully evocative. "War drums sound in the middle of the night, heroes leap on their horses and set out together, competing in the experimental fields, striving to have their names inscribed on the honor roll." "Iron picks are raised high, vigorously digging the deeply sleeping earth, turning the soil over three times, aiming for a yield of 31,000 jin per mu." Such verses are so delightful to read over and over again. Once good poems appear on the poetry forum, they quickly spread among the masses. (Xu Jinyong, Zeng Jianhui, Gong Bing)

　　田头设诗坛
    福建省同安县民歌协会最近创办了“田头诗坛”。“田头诗坛”就是在田头上挂上黑板（或别的板），放在休息的地方或路口，在劳动中谁有感触谁要写诗，就可以直接写在板上。第一次的“田头诗坛”是在洪塘乡举行，目前这已成为洪塘乡俱乐部开展田间文艺活动的一项主要内容了。“田头诗坛”出现的一些作品，有的真是气魄雄伟、意境美妙的好诗。“半夜三更战鼓鸣，群英跃马齐出征，试验田中比干劲，光荣榜上争题名。”“铁镐高举起，猛刨深睡地，田土翻三番，亩产三万一。”像这样的诗句，都是令人越读越爱读。一些好的诗歌一上诗坛，很快就在群众中传开了。（徐金镛、曾剑辉、工兵）
