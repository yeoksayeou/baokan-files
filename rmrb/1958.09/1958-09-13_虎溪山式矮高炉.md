Huxi Mountain Style Small Blast Furnace
This type of blast furnace can use low-iron ore and low-quality metallurgical coke, white coal, etc. for production. The furnace structure is simple and the technical operation is not complicated, so it can be widely promoted everywhere.

The Huxi Mountain style small blast furnace in Lianyuan County, Hunan Province, has many advantages and is worth introducing to various places.

The characteristics of the small blast furnace are: it can use metallurgical coke made from low-caking coal as fuel, or directly use low-caking coal and non-caking coal and lignite as fuel, and can directly smelt lean iron ore. Therefore, the product cost is lower. The small blast furnace has a simple structure, low investment, short construction time, and the operation technology is not complicated.

There are currently two types of small blast furnace designs: one is rectangular, and the other retains the original blast furnace shape, but reduces the height of each part of the furnace, while relatively enlarging the diameter of the hearth, bosh, and throat.

Short-term practical operation proves that the operation of the small blast furnace that retains the original shape of the blast furnace is relatively smooth, and the furnace wall erosion is not significantly different from that of the small blast furnace.

Compared with small blast furnaces, small blast furnaces are lower, with a total height of only 4,450 mm. The furnace material volume is small, and it is entirely possible not to build an outer shell, and the lower part does not need to be built with a brick base. This is convenient for construction and operation.

In the initial production of the small blast furnace in Lianyuan County, high-sulfur coke was used. At the beginning of the furnace operation, due to poor management of raw materials and fuel, the ore particle size reached 5 to 30 mm, and the coke particle size was 60 mm, resulting in high furnace top temperature and large fluctuations in the iron oxide content in the slag. Later, the ore particle size was changed to 5 to 20 mm, with a portion less than 3 mm; the coke particle size was controlled at 10 to 30 mm. As a result, the furnace condition gradually became smoother, and the iron oxide content in the slag dropped to below 0.86%, and the silicon content in pig iron stabilized at around 0.73%. It can be seen that the particle size of raw materials and fuel has different suitable values according to the height of the furnace. If the furnace is lowered and the ore particle size is adjusted accordingly, superior indicators can be obtained for low-furnace production of steelmaking pig iron.

Preliminary tests have confirmed that extremely low-strength, low-quality coal, or even any white coal or lignite with poor thermal stability, can be used in small blast furnaces; lean iron ore can be used as raw material. This enables the utilization of raw materials and fuels that cannot be used in small blast furnaces.

In terms of production technology, Lianyuan County has the following experiences: (1) When smelting steelmaking pig iron, it is necessary to cooperate with external desulfurization and reduce the particle size of raw materials and fuel to control the content of silicon and sulfur.

(2) The small blast furnace can operate smoothly without oxygen-enriched blast. When using lean iron ore without oxygen-enriched blast, it is best to smelt steelmaking pig iron.

(3) According to tests, when using lean ore and high-sulfur coke, the coke ratio is between 1.76 and 1.9, and the furnace condition is relatively normal.

(4) According to tests, this type of furnace can tolerate a large air volume. Currently, the air volume per cubic meter of effective volume reaches 6.55 cubic meters; in the case of a higher coke ratio, the furnace can still increase the air volume.

(5) Because the small blast furnace has a low furnace body and poor utilization of coal gas heat energy, the calorific value of coal gas is higher than that of small blast furnaces. At the same time, the small blast furnace has a high coke ratio and a large calorific value of coal gas, so the equipment using coal gas can greatly exert its potential.

In general, small blast furnaces have many advantages: 1. Low-quality fuels such as low-quality coke, white coal, lump coal, lignite, and even peat can be used. 2. Due to the low furnace body, powder ore less than 5 mm can be used. 3. Since raw materials and fuels are not subject to strict metallurgical restrictions, they can be widely promoted everywhere. 4. The furnace body is short, the material descending time is short, the smelting intensity is high, and good smelting indicators can be obtained. 5. The furnace structure is simple, less steel is used, the investment is not large, the construction time is short, the technical operation is not complicated, and it is easy to promote. However, it also has shortcomings: without using oxygen-enriched blast smelting, using lean ore as raw material, the hearth temperature is low, and only low-silicon pig iron can be produced. Due to the frequent smelting of low-silicon pig iron, the operation is prone to furnace cooling. At the same time, it is not easy to control when producing steelmaking pig iron. In addition, in areas without broken coke and powder ore, there will be some difficulties in the particle size processing of raw materials.

    虎溪山式矮高炉
    这种高炉可以使用含铁低的贫矿和劣质冶金焦、白煤等进行生产，炉子结构简单，技术操作不复杂，因而可以遍地开花，广泛推广。
    湖南省涟源县的虎溪山式矮高炉有许多优点，值得向各地介绍。
    矮高炉的特点是：可以使用粘结性低的煤所炼成的冶金焦为燃料，或者直接使用粘结性低的煤和非粘结性的煤及褐煤为燃料，更能直接冶炼贫铁矿。因此，产品成本较低。矮高炉的结构简单，投资少，基建时间短，操作技术也不复杂。
    矮高炉炉型目前有两种类型，一是长方形，另一种是保持了原来的高炉炉形，只是把炉子的各部分的高度缩小，而炉缸、炉腰、炉喉的直径相对地扩大了。
    短期的实际操作证明，保持高炉原有形状的矮高炉炉况还是比较顺行的，炉壁侵蚀同小高炉比较起来也没有显著差别。
    同小高炉比较，矮高炉要低一些，全高仅四千四百五十公厘，炉料容积较小，完全可以不砌外壳，下部也不需要砌筑砖座。这样，既便于建设，也便于操作。
    涟源县矮高炉初期生产，是用的高硫焦炭。开炉初期，由于原料燃料管理不善，矿砂粒度达五到三十公厘，焦炭粒度六十公厘，以破炉顶温度较高，渣中氧化铁含量波动较大。后来，把矿石粒度改为五到二十公厘，一部分小于三公厘；焦炭粒度控制在十到三十公厘。结果炉况逐趋顺利，炉渣中氧化铁的含量也降到0.86％以下，生铁中矽的含量稳定在0.73％左右。由此可见，原料和燃料的粒度，根据炉子高度的不同有其不同的适合数值。如果将炉子降低，随之也将矿石粒度调整，这样，低炉生产炼钢生铁是可以得到优越指标的。
    试验过程中初步证实，在矮高炉中可以使用强度极低的劣质煤，以至任何热稳定性差的白煤或褐煤；原料可以使用贫铁矿。这样便能利用小高炉上不能用的原料、燃料。
    在生产技术方面，涟源县有以下体会，（一）冶炼炼钢生铁时，必须配合炉外脱硫和原料燃料粒度的缩小，控制矽、硫的含量。
    （二）矮高炉不用氧气鼓风也可使炉子顺行。在不用富氧鼓风的条件下，使用贫铁矿，最好冶炼炼钢生铁。
    （三）根据试验，使用贫矿和高硫焦时，焦比在一点七六到一点九之间，炉况比较正常。
    （四）根据试验，这种炉子是可以容受较大风量的。目前每立方公尺有效容积的风量达六点五五立方公尺；在焦比较高的情况下，炉子还可以加大风量。
    （五）由于矮高炉炉身低，煤气热能利用较差，所以煤气的发热量高于小高炉，同时矮高炉焦比高，煤气发热量大，所以使用煤气的设备可以大大发挥潜力。
    总起来讲，矮高炉有不少优点：1、可以使用低质焦、白煤、碎块、褐煤，以至泥煤等劣质燃料。2、由于炉身低，可以使用小于五公厘的粉矿。3、由于原料、燃料不受冶金的严格限制，因而可以遍地开花，广泛推广。4、炉身短，炉料下降时间短，冶炼强度高，可以得到良好的冶炼指标。5、炉子结构简单，使用钢材少，投资不多，建筑时间短，技术操作不复杂，易于推广。但它也有缺点，这就是：不采用富氧鼓风冶炼时，原料使用贫矿，炉缸温度较低，只能炼制低矽生铁。由于经常冶炼低矽生铁，操作易于发生炉凉的现象。同时，在生产炼钢生铁时，不易控制。另外，在没有碎焦和粉矿的地区，在原材料的粒度处理上会有一些困难。
