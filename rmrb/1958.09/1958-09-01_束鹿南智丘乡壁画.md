　　Zuo Hai's Poem
　　Murals in Nanzhiqiu Township, Shulu County
　　In ancient times, people praised Mount Tai as being high, but I walked around Mount Tai.
　　Looking down at the corn stalks drooping with heavy ears, Mount Tai is actually in the Shandong plains.

　　左海诗
　　束鹿南智丘乡壁画
　　古来夸说泰山高，我绕泰山走一遭。
　　玉米枝头低首看，泰山却在鲁中皋。
