(Reported by this newspaper) The 1,300-plus iron smelting furnaces in Lushan County, Henan Province, almost all produced molten iron, creating an astonishing record of producing 1,068.65 tons on August 28th. This is a county that is far ahead on the iron and steel front. Recently, this county is taking concrete measures to further mobilize the masses, open up mountains and quarries, build roads, and transport ore and coal day and night, advancing towards the new goal of producing more than 2,000 tons per day. Ge Xin, Secretary of the Lushan County Party Committee, and Jia Mengfu, Deputy Secretary, recently wrote an article introducing the experience of creating high records. The following are the main points of this article:

The fact that a thousand tons of iron are produced daily marks a new stage in the development of the smelting industry in Lushan County. The characteristics of this new stage are: First, the entire Party has begun to establish the guiding ideology of taking steel production as the center to mobilize industrial and agricultural production and the overall leap forward in work; second, the stage has shifted from the factory construction stage to the production-oriented stage; third, the smelting industry base has developed from one point to multiple points; fourth, the smelting industry has developed from one type to multiple types. Now Lushan County can not only smelt sintered iron, white pig iron, gray pig iron, and wrought iron, but also steel, copper, aluminum, and zinc.

The iron and steel industry in Lushan County has gone from nothing, from experimentation to mass production. In mid-August, it reached more than 18 tons of iron and steel per day. However, compared with the urgent requirements of the Great Leap Forward situation for steel production, this construction speed still seemed very slow. Therefore, the County Party Committee proposed the initiative of releasing "satellites" at the industrial cadre expansion meeting held in early August, requiring the release of "satellite" counties with a daily output of 1,000 tons and many "satellite" factories and satellite furnaces in August. All districts (townships) and factories and mines formulated their own plans based on this decision, and universally established the "satellite fields" and the responsibility system for cultivating "satellites" with the "five determinations" method of setting tasks and time, setting personnel, setting leadership, setting quality, and setting materials. This turned the requirement of greatly developing steel and rapidly increasing unit output into the determination of cadres and the broad masses of workers, and quickly set off a competition movement of "everyone working hard and practically, everyone contributing ideas and creating, and promoting satellites to heaven."

However, many ideological problems still exist among some cadres and masses in Lushan County, mainly: attaching importance to agriculture and neglecting industry; being willing to engage in light industry and holding negative emotions about greatly developing steel. The onlookers also came out to make sarcastic remarks: "Picking ore with ten fingers, slapping mud jars with two palms, building a furnace with earthen walls, without even a blower, it is really a wild boast to release a thousand-ton satellite." In response to these ideological problems, a special debate was launched throughout the county on "whether greatly developing steel affects agricultural production, whether a daily output of 1,000 tons can be achieved, and whether indigenous iron smelting can make a great leap forward." Through the debate, the one-sided views and right-leaning conservative thinking of "emphasizing agriculture and neglecting industry" and "emphasizing general industry and neglecting iron and steel industry production" were centrally criticized. At the same time, in the mass debate process, the fact that Zongzhuang Township and Zhao Village District created and improved indigenous iron smelting blast furnaces, and increased the daily output of iron from 500 jin to more than 2,000 jin, powerfully refuted "the theory of conditions" and "the theory of low production," greatly liberating thinking.

In the case of a weak foundation in the iron and steel industry, achieving a daily output of 1,000 tons of iron puts arduous tasks on furnaces, raw materials, labor, and transportation forces. To this end, the County Party Committee first strengthened its leadership in these areas, and from the county to the districts (townships) and factories and mines, first secretaries were put in charge, and command headquarters and supervision groups were established to conduct inspections and guidance in the districts, townships, and factories and mines. All Party committees are divided into three fronts, namely, furnace construction, smelting, and mining and transportation support, for leadership. From the county to the districts, townships, communes, factories and mines, accounts are calculated in detail, and the needs for furnaces, fuel, ore, smelting materials, crucibles, labor, and transportation forces required to complete the iron and steel "satellite" are calculated in detail, a comprehensive plan is made, and various professional teams are established accordingly. According to the material needs of the plan, tasks are also put forward to various factories and mines, organs, schools, shops, and commune production teams. As a result, a mass upsurge of furnace construction, road repair, mining, material transportation, can making, and smelting has been rapidly set off throughout the county. According to statistics, a total of more than 39,800 laborers and more than 9,000 various vehicles were dispatched from the twelve districts and townships in the county, and 2,420 tons of ore, 2,500 tons of coal, and 350 tons of smelting materials were transported in a half-month assault. This not only guaranteed the needs of smelting, but also stored up raw materials for regular production. In order to solve the contradiction of insufficient labor and transportation tools in the great development of iron and steel "satellites," counties, districts (townships), factories and mines have universally launched a technological innovation movement centered on three improvements (reforming transportation tools, improving furnace shapes, and improving operation methods). The method of making wooden wheel cans has been promoted in most parts of the county. The transportation department has improved transportation management and basically eliminated the phenomenon of empty running.

At present, the people of the county are full of confidence and are fighting day and night to complete the production plan of producing 200,000 tons of steel this year and to release larger and more steel "satellites." The County Party Committee has decided to grasp production with one hand and construction with the other, and while grasping furnace construction, lead the people to vigorously improve blowing tools and transportation tools to ensure the supply of coal and ore, and strive for larger and more steel "satellites" to take to the sky.

    取得鲁山炼铁经
    日产千吨并不难
    书记挂帅　大辩大论
    全民动手　全面协作
    措施具体　革新技术
    本报讯　河南省鲁山县的一千三百多座炼铁炉，几乎全部都流出了铁水，在8月28日创造了日产生产1068.65吨的惊人纪录，这是目前钢铁战线上远远跑在前面的一个县。最近，这个县正在采取具体措施，进一步发动群众，开山辟石、兴修公路，昼夜采运矿石和煤炭，向日产两千吨以上的新目标前进。中共鲁山县委书记革新和副书记贾孟福，最近写文章介绍了创造高纪录的经验，下面就是这篇文章的要点：
    日产铁千吨的事实，标志着鲁山县冶炼工业发展到了一个新的阶段。这个新阶段的特点是：一、全党开始树立了以钢铁生产为中心调动工业、农业生产和全面工作大跃进的指导思想；二、由建厂阶段转向以生产为主的阶段；三、冶炼工业基地由一点发展到多点；四、冶炼工业由一种发展到多种。现在鲁山县不但能炼烧结铁、白生铁、灰生铁、熟铁，而且还能炼钢和炼铜、炼铝、炼锌。
    鲁山县的钢铁工业从无到有，从试验走上了大量生产的道路。8月中旬曾达到日产钢铁十八吨以上。但是，这个建设速度和大跃进的形势对钢铁生产的迫切要求相比，仍然显得非常缓慢。因此，县委在8月上旬召开的工业扩干会议上提出了大放“卫星”的倡议，要求8月份放出日产千吨的“卫星”县和许多“卫星”厂、卫星炉。各区（乡）和各厂矿均根据这一决定，制订了自己的规划，并以定任务和时间、定人员、定领导、定质量、定物资的“五定”办法，普遍建立了“卫星田”和培养“卫星”的责任制。这就把大办钢铁、迅速提高单位产量的要求变成了干部和广大职工的决心，迅速掀起了“人人苦干实干、个个献计创造、促使卫星上天”的竞赛运动。
    但是，鲁山县部分干部和群众中仍有不少的思想问题，主要的有：重视农业、忽视工业；愿搞轻工业，对大办钢铁持消极情绪。观潮派也出来说风凉话：“十个指头捡矿石，两个巴掌拍泥罐，土墙垒个炉，连鼓风机也没有，放千吨卫星真是胡吹”。针对这些思想问题，在全县范围内开展了“大办钢铁是否影响农业生产，日产千吨能否实现，土法炼铁能不能大跃进”等专题的大鸣大放大辩论。通过辩论，集中地批判了“重农业轻工业”、“重一般工业忽视钢铁工业生产”等片面观点和右倾保守思想。同时，在群众性的辩论过程中，还用宗庄乡和赵村区创造改进了炼铁土高炉、日产铁由五百斤提高到二千余斤的事实，有力地驳斥了“唯条件论”和“低产论”，大大解放了思想。
    在钢铁工业基础薄弱的情况下，要日产千吨铁，对炉子、原材料、劳力、运输力量都提出了艰巨的任务。为此，县委首先加强了对这些方面的领导，从县到区（乡）和厂矿均以第一书记挂帅，建立了指挥部、督导团，深入区、乡、厂矿进行检查指导。所有党委都按建炉、冶炼、采矿和运输支援划分三条战线，进行领导，从县到、区、乡、社、厂矿都通过算账，详细地算出了完成钢铁“卫星”需要的炉子、燃料、矿石、熔炼材料、坩埚、劳力和运输力量的需要，作出了全面的规划，并相应地建立了各种专业队，根据规划的物资需要，对各厂矿、机关、学校、商店、公社生产队也提出了任务。于是，一个群众性的建炉、修路、采矿、运料、制罐、冶炼的高潮在全县迅速地掀起来了。据统计全县十二个区乡，共出劳动力三万九千八百多人，各种车九千多辆，半个月突击采运矿石二千四百二十吨，煤炭二千五百吨，熔炼材料三百五十吨。这不但保证了冶炼的需要，而且为经常性的生产储备了原料。为了解决大放钢铁“卫星”中劳力、运输工具不足的矛盾，县区（乡）和厂矿，普遍地掀起了以三改良（改革运输工具，改进炉形，改进操作方法）为中心的技术革新运动。全县大部地区推广了木轮制罐法。运输部门改进了运输管理，基本消灭了放空跑路的现象。
    目前，全县人民正信心百倍地为完成今年产二十万吨钢铁的生产计划，为放出更大更多的钢铁“卫星”在日夜奋战着。县委决定一手抓生产，一手抓建设，在抓建炉的同时，领导人民群众大力进行吹风工具和交通运输工具的改进，保证煤炭、矿石的供应，争取更大的、更多的钢铁“卫星”上天。
