Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Wei Lihuang, Standing Committee Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, was unable to attend the 15th Supreme State Conference convened by Chairman Mao Zedong due to illness. On the 7th, he sent a letter to Premier Zhou Enlai, expressing his warm support for Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait. The letter stated: "This morning, when my family read the newspaper to me, I learned that you had issued a statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait. I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support this statement. Liberating our territory is the sacred right of our people, and no foreign force may interfere. If American imperialism dares to provoke us crazily, we must fight it to the end, and we have the strength to crush its threats." "I will definitely take good care of myself and am determined to overcome my illness, hoping to recover soon so that I can contribute my share to socialist construction and the liberation of Taiwan. Although I am bedridden now, I am still willing to do as much as I can."
