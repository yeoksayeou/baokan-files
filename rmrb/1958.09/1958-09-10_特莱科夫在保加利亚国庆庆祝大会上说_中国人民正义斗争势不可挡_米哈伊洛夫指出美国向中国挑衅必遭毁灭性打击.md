Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 8th - At a grand rally held here on the 8th to celebrate the 14th anniversary of Bulgaria's National Day, Terekhoff, First Deputy Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, sternly condemned the shameless armed provocations and war threats launched by U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait region against the Chinese people.
　　He said that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and other coastal islands is a legitimate and just cause, and a sacred struggle for the unification of the motherland, which cannot be stopped by anyone. No matter how provocative and threatening the U.S. imperialists are, the great Chinese people will never be alarmed and will be determined to crush any aggressor. The entire socialist camp and all peace-loving people stand with the Chinese people.
　　In his report, Terekhoff also talked about the great achievements made by the Bulgarian people under the leadership of the Party in socialist construction over the past 14 years. He said that capitalism has been finally eliminated in Bulgaria's cities and villages, and Bulgaria has been transformed from a backward agricultural country into a socialist country with developed industry and cooperative, mechanized agriculture. By the end of 1957, the ratio between industrial and agricultural production had reached 68.3 to 31.7. Compared with 1939, electricity production has increased nine times, and coal production has increased 4.37 times. Since the establishment of the people's government, the socialist transformation of agriculture has achieved a historically significant victory throughout the country, with more than 92% of farmers participating in agricultural cooperatives.
　　In his report, Terekhoff also emphasized the importance of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the necessity of opposing modern revisionism represented by the program of the Yugoslav League of Communists. He said that the Bulgarian people will remain faithful to the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union in all circumstances, because the Bulgarian people know that friendship with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries will guarantee the complete victory of Bulgaria's socialist construction. Terekhoff said that the unity among socialist countries is unbreakable. The imperialists are very afraid of this and are trying every possible means to shake the unity of the socialist camp. In this regard, the imperialists place their hopes on modern revisionists. The Bulgarian people are proud that the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, with its glorious internationalist and revolutionary traditions, was conducted under the banner of resolutely opposing modern revisionism. Terekhoff emphasized that the Bulgarian people will protect this unity like the apple of their eye.
　　In his report, Terekhoff pointed out that the resolutions adopted by the recent special session of the United Nations General Assembly must be implemented, and the U.S. and British aggressor troops must withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.
　　Bulgarian party and state leaders Zhivkov, Yugov, and R. Damyanov attended the celebration on the 8th. Ronai, Speaker of the Hungarian National Assembly who is on vacation in Bulgaria, Belishova, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, and Scholz, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, were also invited to attend the celebration.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 9th - A grand military parade and mass procession were held in Sofia this morning to celebrate Bulgaria's National Day.
　　Before the start of the military parade, Mikhailov, Deputy Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers and Minister of National Defense, spoke on the reviewing stand. He condemned the armed provocations and war threats currently being carried out by U.S. imperialists against China in the Taiwan Strait.
　　Mikhailov said that the U.S. imperialists are not reconciled to their failure in the Middle East and are now attempting to intensify international tensions in the Far East by sending troops to the Taiwan and coastal islands of the People's Republic of China to carry out provocations against the People's Republic of China. However, the Bulgarian people can tell the U.S. imperialists frankly: you will be forced to abandon your aggressive plans in the Taiwan Strait as well. He said that the Chinese people have enough strength to give the aggressors a devastating blow. The Chinese people are not isolated, and with them are the great Soviet people and the people of other socialist countries, as well as all progressive mankind.
　　Mikhailov emphasized that the forces of peace and democracy now surpass the forces of war. If the imperialists dare to provoke a war, there is no doubt that the people of all countries will forever eliminate the capitalist system that brings disaster to mankind.
　　In his speech, Mikhailov also emphasized that the Bulgarian People's Army has now grown into a new type of socialist army, with powerful military technology and modern equipment, and a high degree of discipline and combat effectiveness.
　　After Mikhailov finished speaking, the military parade began. The army, navy, and air force troops passed through the square majestically. The silver jet fighters streaking across the sky and the powerful artillery units rumbling through the square won warm cheers.
　　This was followed by a mighty mass procession of hundreds of thousands of people. The marchers held up various banners. Some banners read: "Long live the beloved Bulgarian Communist Party!" "Long live Bulgarian-Soviet friendship!" "Long live the pillar of peace in Asia - the People's Republic of China!" "U.S. imperialists get out of Taiwan!" As the procession passed in front of the reviewing stand in the square, they warmly cheered to the Bulgarian leaders Zhivkov, Yugov, and R. Damyanov on the reviewing stand. The military parade and mass procession lasted about four hours.
　　On the evening of the 9th, Yugov, Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, held a grand reception to celebrate National Day.

    特莱科夫在保加利亚国庆庆祝大会上说
　　中国人民正义斗争势不可挡
    米哈伊洛夫指出美国向中国挑衅必遭毁灭性打击
    据新华社索非亚8日电　保加利亚部长会议第一副主席特莱科夫8日在这里举行的庆祝保加利亚国庆十四周年的盛大集会上严厉谴责了美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区发动的反对中国人民的无耻武装挑衅和战争威胁。
    他说，中国人民解放台湾和其他沿海岛屿是合法的、正义的事业，是中国人民争取祖国统一的神圣斗争，这是任何人所不能阻挡的。无论美帝国主义分子怎样挑衅和威胁，伟大的中国人民绝不会惊慌失措，他们决心粉碎任何侵略者。整个社会主义阵营和全体爱好和平的人类都同中国人民站在一起。
    特莱科夫在他的报告中还谈到保加利亚人民在党的领导下，十四年来在社会主义建设方面所取得的巨大成就。他说，在保加利亚的城市和乡村都已经最后消灭了资本主义，保加利亚已经从一个落后的农业国变成了一个拥有发达的工业和合作化、机械化的农业的社会主义国家。到1957年年底，工农业生产之间的比例已经达到六十八点三比三十一点七。同1939年相比，电力生产增加了九倍，煤的产量增加了四点三七倍。在人民政权建立以来，农业的社会主义改造在全国已取得了具有历史意义的胜利，92％以上的农户已经参加了农业合作社。
    特莱科夫在报告中还强调了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结的重要性和反对以南共纲领为代表的现代修正主义的必要性。他说，保加利亚人民在一切情况下都将忠实于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，因为保加利亚人民知道，同苏联和其他社会主义国家的友谊，将保证保加利亚社会主义建设的完全胜利。特莱科夫说，社会主义各国间的团结是牢不可破的。帝国主义分子非常害怕这一点，就千方百计地企图动摇社会主义阵营的团结。在这方面，帝国主义分子把希望寄托于现代修正主义分子。保加利亚人民感到骄傲的是，具有光荣的国际主义和革命传统的保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会是在坚决反对现代修正主义的标志下进行的，特莱科夫强调指出，保加利亚人民将像保护自己的眼珠一样来保护这个团结。
    特莱科夫在报告中指出，不久以前举行的联大特别会议所通过的决议必须付诸实现，美英侵略军必须撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    参加8日的庆祝大会的有保加利亚党和国家的领导人日夫科夫、于哥夫、拉·达米扬诺夫等。在保加利亚休假的匈牙利国民议会议长罗奈伊，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、党中央书记别利绍娃，民主德国副总理绍尔茨等也应邀出席了庆祝会。
    新华社索非亚9日电　索非亚今天上午举行了盛大的阅兵和群众游行，庆祝保加利亚国庆。
    在阅兵开始以前，保加利亚部长会议副主席、国防部长米哈伊洛夫在检阅台上讲了话。他谴责美帝国主义者目前在台湾海峡对中国进行的武装挑衅和战争威胁。
    米哈伊洛夫说，美帝国主义者对他们在中近东的失败还不甘心，现在又企图在远东加剧国际紧张局势，派军队到中华人民共和国的台湾和沿海岛屿地区进行挑衅，反对中华人民共和国。但是，保加利亚人民可以正告美帝国主义者：你们在台湾海峡同样地要被迫放弃侵略计划。他说，中国人民有足够的力量给予侵略者以毁灭性的打击。中国人民不是孤立的，同他们在一起的还有伟大的苏联人民和其他社会主义国家的人民以及全体进步人类。
    米哈伊洛夫强调说，和平和民主力量现在已超过了战争力量。如果帝国主义胆敢挑起战争，毫无疑问，各国人民将永远消灭给人类带来灾难的资本主义制度。
    米哈伊洛夫在讲话中还强调指出，保加利亚人民军现在已经成长为新型的社会主义军队，它拥有强大的军事技术和现代化装备，具有高度的纪律和战斗力。
    米哈伊洛夫讲话结束以后，阅兵分列式开始。陆海空军部队威武地通过了广场。划空而过的银色喷气战斗机和隆隆通过广场的强大炮兵部队，博得了热烈的欢呼声。
    随后是浩浩荡荡的数十万人的群众游行队伍。游行者举着各种标语牌。一些标语牌上写着：“亲爱的保加利亚共产党万岁！”“保苏友谊万岁！”“亚洲和平的支柱——中华人民共和国万岁！”“美帝国主义者从台湾滚出去！”游行队伍通过广场检阅台前时，向检阅台上的保加利亚领导人日夫科夫、于哥夫、拉·达米扬诺夫等热烈欢呼。阅兵和群众游行共进行了约四个小时。
    9日晚间，保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫举行了庆祝国庆节的盛大招待会。
