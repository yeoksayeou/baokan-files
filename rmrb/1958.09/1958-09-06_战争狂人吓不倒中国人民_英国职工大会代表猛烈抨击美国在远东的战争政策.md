Xinhua News Agency, Bounemouth, September 4th: American war policy in the Taiwan Strait was sharply criticized during the British Trades Union Congress annual meeting today when international issues were discussed. Representatives speaking at the annual meeting put forward strong demands, advocating stopping American war maniacs and immediately restoring China's seat in the United Nations.

    "National Union of Mineworkers" representative Wood said that the existence of Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt government under American support "is very dangerous to world peace."

    He said: "Now we are in a situation where either the current situation full of the danger of atomic war continues, or the legitimate Chinese representatives enter the United Nations and world peace is guaranteed."

    He said: "Despite the various statements made by American war maniacs, the Chinese people will never be intimidated. I have been to China, and the Chinese people want peace. But in any case, they will never be intimidated by America's show of force."

    However, he warned that war maniacs might take action to undermine peace, and supporting American policy towards China would lead to world war. He demanded that the British trade union movement force the government to oppose American war policy.

    "National Federation of Furniture Trade Unions" Assistant Secretary Shanley also drew everyone's attention to the serious situation in the Far East caused by American policy. He asked: Does Britain intend to support the United States in waging war to maintain the bankrupt Chiang Kai-shek group, thereby risking the danger of a world war? He said that no one in Britain believes that Chiang Kai-shek represents China in any sense. There is no moral justification for defending this farce of allowing the Chiang Kai-shek representative to continue to occupy the United Nations.

    He emphasized that "if the real Chinese government is not recognized by the United Nations, then how can we claim to be seeking a peaceful solution to the Far East problem?"

    He announced that his union firmly advocates admitting China into the United Nations, saying that this is a necessary condition for maintaining peace.

    He said that British trade union members must wage a real struggle in Britain to force the government to take resolute steps to allow representatives of the real Chinese government to be stationed in the United Nations.

    "Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians" representative Bond said that the British government formally recognizes China on the one hand, but on the other hand, it is afraid of offending the United States and has always been hesitant to raise the issue of China's representation in the United Nations. He believes this is a "strange situation." He said: "World peace is in jeopardy until the American government stops giving military support to the bankrupt Chiang Kai-shek bandits."

    He demanded that the Trades Union Congress General Council put forward an emergency resolution on this issue to show the world that the British trade union movement will not tolerate American interference policy in the Far East and Taiwan.

    These people's speeches were met with warm applause at the meeting.

    Alfred Roberts, representing the General Council, also expressed serious concern about the situation in the Taiwan Strait in his reply, and assured that efforts would be made as early as possible to help prevent the expansion of the serious situation.

　　战争狂人吓不倒中国人民
　　英国职工大会代表猛烈抨击美国在远东的战争政策
    新华社菩恩穆斯4日电　在英国职工大会年会今天讨论国际问题的时候，美国在台湾海峡的战争政策遭到了尖锐的抨击。年会上发言的代表们提出了有力的要求，主张制止美国的战争狂人和立即恢复中国在联合国的席位。
      “全国矿工联盟”的代表伍德说，蒋介石腐败政府在美国支持下的存在“对于世界和平是非常危险的”。
    他说：“现在我们是处在这样一种情况：或者是让目前这样充满原子战争危险的局势继续下去，或者让合法的中国代表进入联合国和使得世界和平得到保证。”
    他说：“尽管美国战争狂人发表种种声明，中国人民是决不会被吓倒的。我曾经到过中国，中国人民希望和平。但是在任何情况下，他们都绝不会被美国的显示力量所吓倒。”
    不过他警告说，战争狂人可能采取行动破坏和平，支持美国对华政策将会导向世界大战。他要求英国工会运动迫使政府反对美国战争政策。
      “全国家具业职工联盟”助理书记尚莱也请大家注意由于美国政策而造成的远东严重局势。他责问道：英国是否打算支持美国进行战争来维持破产了的蒋介石集团，从而冒发生世界大战的危险？他说，英国没有人认为蒋介石在任何意义上代表中国。对于这出让蒋介石代表继续盘踞在联合国的滑稽戏，是没有任何道义上的理由来进行辩解的。
    他强调说，“如果真正的中国政府没有得到联合国的承认，那么我们又怎能自称是在寻求远东问题的和平解决办法呢？”
    他宣布说，他的工会坚决主张接纳中国入联合国，他说这是维护和平的必要条件。
    他说，英国工会会员必须在英国进行真正的斗争，迫使政府采取坚决的步骤，来让真正的中国政府的代表驻在联合国。
    “电影、电视和有关技术人员协会”的代表邦德说，英国政府一方面在形式上承认中国，另一方面却害怕触犯美国而始终迟迟不提出中国在联合国的代表权问题。他认为这是“奇怪的状况”。他说：“在美国政府停止给予破产的蒋介石匪徒军事支持之前，世界和平是岌岌可危的。”
    他要求职工大会最高委员会就这个问题提出紧急决议案，以便向全世界表明，英国工会运动不会容忍美国在远东和台湾的干涉政策。
    这几个人的发言都在会上博得了热烈掌声。
    艾尔弗雷德·罗伯茨代表最高委员会作答复时，也表示对台湾海峡局势感到严重关怀，并且保证要及早努力协助防止严重局势的扩大。
