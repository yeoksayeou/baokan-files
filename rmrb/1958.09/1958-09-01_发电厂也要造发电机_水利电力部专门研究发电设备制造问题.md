Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: According to the instructions of Chairman Mao and Comrade Liu Shaoqi, many power plants across the country have changed their old traditions and begun to use their repair and modification capabilities to vigorously manufacture power generation equipment to equip themselves. According to statistics, these power plants will produce complete sets of power generation equipment with a total capacity of 110,000 kilowatts this year.

Since the upsurge of the mass campaign to run industries nationwide this year, the demand for electricity has increased rapidly, and the motor manufacturing departments and basic construction sector have not been able to keep up. Chairman Mao and Comrade Liu Shaoqi are very concerned about this issue. When Chairman Mao visited the Tianjin Industrial Technology Revolution Exhibition on August 12, he praised the Tianjin Power Plant’s repair workers for manufacturing power generation equipment, saying this was a very good method. Chairman Mao said, why can power plants only generate electricity and not manufacture generators? It can be expanded a little, and some workers can be fixed to become workshops attached to the power plant. During a discussion with employees at the Shijingshan Power Plant in July, Comrade Liu Shaoqi also encouraged the plant to use its repair and maintenance capabilities to manufacture generators to solve the current problem of insufficient power generation equipment.

These instructions from Chairman Mao and Comrade Liu Shaoqi gave all electricity workers great inspiration and encouragement. Many repair workers have expressed their willingness to do their best to implement the instructions of the two leaders. The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power also recently held a meeting of provincial electricity bureaus to specifically study the manufacturing of power generation equipment. According to the reports from various electricity bureaus, the potential for repair and manufacturing in the national electricity system is very large. Among more than 100 large and medium-sized power plants, almost all have repair workshops of varying sizes and a certain number of metal processing machine tools. In addition, there are specialized repair and manufacturing factories and basic construction parts factories in Liangxiang, Shanghai, Shenyang, Fushun, Changchun, Harbin, and other places. As long as the dispersed positive forces are well organized, appropriately supplemented, adjusted, and given technical assistance, they can undertake a large number of tasks in manufacturing small and complete sets of large power generation equipment.

In order to enable the electricity system to better utilize existing repair capabilities and use indigenous methods and economical methods to manufacture power generation equipment, the meeting exchanged some successful experiences and focused on learning and visiting the "ants gnawing at bones" method created by the machinery industry sector. During the meeting, various factories also established mutual cooperation relationships based on equipment, technology, and other conditions, and decided to adopt the method of learning from each other's strengths and overcoming difficulties in the manufacturing process by exchanging what they have for what they need.

　　发电厂也要造发电机
　　水利电力部专门研究发电设备制造问题
    据新华社31日讯　根据毛主席和刘少奇同志的指示，全国好多电厂已经改变旧传统，开始利用修配力量大造发电设备来装备自己。据统计，这些电厂今年将生产出总容量为十一万瓩的成套发电设备。
    今年全国各地掀起全民办工业的热潮以后，用电需要量迅速增加，电机制造部门和基本建设方面一时赶不上。毛主席和刘少奇同志对这个问题非常关怀。毛主席在8月12日参观天津市工业技术革命展览会的时候，听说天津发电厂的修配工人正在制造发电设备，称赞这个办法很好。毛主席说，发电厂为什么只能发电而不能制造发电机呢？可以扩大一点，固定一些工人，成为发电厂附带的车间。刘少奇同志7月间在石景山发电厂同职工座谈的时候，也鼓励这个厂利用修配和检修力量制造发电机，解决当前部分发电设备不足的问题。
  毛主席和刘少奇同志的这些指示，给了全体电业职工极大的启发与鼓舞。许多修配工人都纷纷表示，愿意竭尽全力来贯彻两位领导同志的指示。水利电力部也在最近召开各省电业局会议，专门研究了发电设备的制造问题。根据各电业局汇报，全国电业系统修配与制造的潜力很大。一百多个大中型的发电厂中，差不多都有规模大小不等的修配车间和若干数量的金属加工机床。此外，在良乡、上海、沈阳、抚顺、长春、哈尔滨等地，还有专门的修造工厂和基本建设配件厂。只要把分散的积极力量很好组织起来，适当地加以补充、调整和技术上的帮助，就可以大量承担制造小型和成套大型发电设备的任务。
    为了使电业系统更好地利用现有修配力量，采用土办法和穷办法制造发电设备，会议交流了一些成功的经验，并且着重学习和参观了机械工业部门创造的蚂蚁啃骨头的好办法。在会议期间，各厂还根据设备、技术各方面的条件，建立了相互协作关系，决定采用取长补短、互通有无的办法来克服制造过程中的困难。
