    District Head “Scavenges”
    In order to support industry in "fighting drought," Gui Suzhen, Deputy District Head of the Putuo District People's Committee in Shanghai, took the lead in "scavenging." On August 25th, Gui Suzhen took a lead bucket and led a group of cadres to collect 1,883 jin of iron nails, iron blocks, iron bars, iron wire, and scrap copper near North Zhongshan Road and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. The next day, they collected another 115 jin.
    For the needs of the work, the head of a district can scavenge; in order to respond to the Party's call, the district head can become a "scavenger." This is precisely the true color of the people's government cadres who serve the people.

### 区长“拾荒”

    区长“拾荒”
    为着支援工业“抗旱”，上海市普陀区人民委员会副区长归素贞带头“拾荒”。8月25日，归素贞拿了一只铅桶，带领一批干部到中山北路、沪杭铁路附近拾得铁钉、铁块、铁条、铁丝及烂铜等一千八百八十三斤。第二天又拾得一百十五斤。
    为着工作需要，一区之长可以拾荒；为着响应党的号召，区长可以成为“拾荒者”。这正是为人民服务的人民政府干部的本色。
