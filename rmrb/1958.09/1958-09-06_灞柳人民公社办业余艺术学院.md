　　Bayliu People's Commune Establishes Amateur Art Institute
　　This newspaper reports: In order to further develop rural artistic activities and cultivate artistic backbone forces, the Bayliu People's Commune in Baqiao District, Xi'an City, recently established an amateur art institute. Currently, 280 people are participating in the institute's studies.
　　This art institute has departments for drama, folk art, political mobilization, and fine arts, as well as a creation department. It also plans to establish a Grandma Paper Cutting class. Each department is located in villages with relatively good artistic activities, such as Nanniushi and Guojiaqu, using these villages as a base to attract people from nearby villages to participate. The learning method is: focusing on developing creation and performance practice activities, improving through practice, and lecturing on professional knowledge once or twice a month. The teaching staff of this school is composed of folk artists, transferred cadres, and cadres from cultural and artistic departments.
　　Since the opening of this institute, only a few days ago, many students have created works reflecting the new look of the socialist countryside.

　　灞柳人民公社办业余艺术学院
    本报讯　为了进一步开展农村文艺活动和培养艺术骨干力量，西安市灞桥区灞柳人民公社最近办起一所业余艺术学院。现在学院参加学习的已有二百八十人。
    这所艺术学院设有戏剧、曲艺、政治鼓动、美术等系和一个创作部，还准备设一个老大娘剪纸班。各系分设在文艺活动开展较好的南牛市、郭家渠等村，以这些村子为基点，吸收附近各村群众参加。学习的方法是：以开展创作、演出实践活动为主，在实践中提高，每月讲授专业知识一至二次。这个学校的教学人员由民间艺人、下放干部和文化艺术部门的干部等担任。
    这所学院开学到现在还没有几天，就有不少学员创作出反映社会主义新农村面貌的作品。
