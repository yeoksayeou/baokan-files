Studying Political Theory at the Core
Rural Night Party Schools Popularized in Hulan County, Heilongjiang

(Our Reporter Han Zhifei, Correspondent Han Shuren report): Party organizations in the townships and rural branches of Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, have broadly established night party schools by following the mass line.

Hulan County has already popularized a network of party schools. Besides the one night party school at the county committee office, and the fourteen branch schools established by the Party committees or Party general branches of various industries, all twenty-five townships and two hundred and fifty-nine agricultural producers' cooperatives in the county have established township-level night party school headquarters and agricultural cooperative branch schools. In addition, there are eighty-three teaching stations responsible for imparting Party lessons. Among the county's four thousand five hundred and sixty Party members and nine thousand three hundred and five activists, all are already studying in these party schools.

In their teaching, these night party schools have universally adopted the method of using the experience of actual local struggles to illustrate and enrich the theory being studied; conversely, they use the theory learned to guide current practical work. For example, the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative branch school, while deeply studying the General Line for Socialist Construction, and in accordance with the political task at the time, which was to transform landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and other bad elements, studied the issue of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Through this study, everyone analyzed the situation of a "poor peasant" named Ye Xiangsheng in their cooperative. Some people thought that he was ideologically backward, often saying strange things, and that this was a matter of internal contradictions among the people. However, most people, having raised their level of understanding, exposed many of the reactionary remarks that this "poor peasant" had spread in his daily life. They also revealed that he had hidden a Kuomintang flag for a long time, and people further exposed that he had obtained it from somewhere after liberation. From his reactionary remarks and actions, everyone unanimously determined that this was a matter of contradictions between ourselves and the enemy.

Another advantage of these night party schools is that Party members and the masses study together, maintaining close ties with the masses. When Party members have shortcomings, they can be quickly overcome with the help and supervision of the local masses. Liu Chongzheng (Party member), a clerk in Daliu Township, was transferred from the military and assigned to work in the township. He had always been uneasy about rural work and his attitude towards the masses was very stiff. The leadership had talked to him several times, but the problem was not thoroughly resolved. Later, after attending several Party lessons and debating with the masses, the masses criticized his work style, and he began to recognize his shortcomings. Through Party school study, the political and ideological awareness of non-Party activists has also been further enhanced, establishing a concept of serving the people.

When giving lectures, the Party schools, in addition to the basic students, have many members of the masses who automatically come to listen. Therefore, the rural night party schools have become the core for the entire county to study political theory, and these night party schools lead the people to study the works of Mao Zedong. At present, there are more than four thousand study groups in the county directly under the leadership of these night party schools, conducting political theory studies.

### 学习政治理论的核心  黑龙江呼兰县农村普及了夜党校

    学习政治理论的核心
    黑龙江呼兰县农村普及了夜党校
    本报讯　记者韩之非、通讯员韩树人报道：黑龙江省呼兰县各乡党组织和农村支部，走群众路线普遍办好了夜党校。
    呼兰县已经普及了党校网。全县除了县委办一处夜党校和按各行业的党委或党总支成立了十四处分校外，全县二十五个乡镇和二百五十九个农业生产合作社，都办起了乡的夜党校总校和农业社分校。另外还有八十三处负责传授党课工作的授课站，全县四千五百六十名党员，九千三百零五名积极分子，已经在这些党校学习。
    这些夜党校在教学中普遍采取了用本地实际斗争的经验，来说明和充实所学习的理论；反过来又用学到的理论，来指导当前的实际工作。例如金星农业社分校，在深入学习社会主义建设总路线的时候，根据当时的政治任务，是改造地主富农反革命分子和其他坏分子，就学习了巩固无产阶级专政问题。通过这次学习，大家分析了本社一个“贫农”叶向生的情况，有些人认为他是思想落后，平日好讲个怪话，是人民内部矛盾；但大部分人因为提高了认识水平，纷纷揭露了这个“贫农”在日常散布的许多反动言论，并且还揭露他长期隐藏了一面国民党旗，大家又进一步揭发他是在解放以后，不知从哪搬来的。大家从他的反动言论和行动，一致认定这是敌我矛盾问题。
    这些夜党校的另一个优点，是党员和群众在一起学习，和群众有着紧密的联系。对于党员的缺点，能够及时在当地群众的帮助和监督下，很快地得到克服。大刘乡文书刘崇正（党员），从部队转业分配到乡工作后，一直不安心农村工作，对群众的态度也很生硬，领导上曾和他谈过几次话，没有彻底解决问题。后来上过几次党课，和群众在一起辩论，群众对他的工作作风提出了批评，他才开始认识了自己的缺点。通过党课学习，对那些非党积极分子，也进一步提高他们政治思想觉悟，树立了为人民服务的思想。
    各党校在讲课时，除基本学员参加外，还有不少群众自动前来听讲。因此，农村的夜党校，成为全县全民学习政治理论的核心，由这些夜党校领导人民群众进行毛泽东著作的学习。目前，全县在这些夜党校直接领导下，进行政治理论学习的小组，已达四千多个。
