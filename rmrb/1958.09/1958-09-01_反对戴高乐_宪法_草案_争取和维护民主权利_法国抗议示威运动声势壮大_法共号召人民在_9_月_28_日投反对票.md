Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 30th - The movement of working people against de Gaulle's draft "constitution" is gaining momentum.

The French General Confederation of Labor's Railway Workers Federation has called on all railway workers to actively participate in demonstrations and marches held successively in various places starting from September 4th, to express their opposition to de Gaulle, their determination to strive for the satisfaction of their rights and demands, and their determination to uphold the republican system.

The French General Confederation of Labor's Transport Workers Union Federation has also called on local union organizations and enterprise union branches, as well as all transport workers, to launch a struggle to achieve their rights and demands, and to conduct discussions to persuade their relatives and friends to vote "no" in the "referendum"; at the same time, they should actively participate in all demonstrations and marches carried out for this purpose, in order to thwart the reactionary forces that are temporarily in power illegally in the country.

The French General Confederation of Labor's Food, Hotel, and Catering Industry Union Federation requires all employees to participate in demonstrations and marches held in various places for the anti-de Gaulle traveling propaganda activities, and to vote "no" in the upcoming "referendum."

Construction workers in Rouen unanimously passed a resolution to vote "no." Construction workers in Grand-Couronne also passed the same resolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 30th - The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a statement on de Gaulle's recent trip to Africa to seek support for his draft "constitution," saying: Several important lessons can be drawn from de Gaulle's trip:

One, a powerful and irreversible liberation movement is sweeping across Africa and Madagascar.

Two, de Gaulle completely ignores reality. His experience of being in power for three months proves that he is completely incapable of solving the problems of Africans.

Three, under the current circumstances, considering the development of the national liberation movements in the colonies, only by recognizing the independence of the people of these countries can beneficial, friendly, and solid relations be established with them on the basis of equality, free consent, and mutual benefit. This solution applies to Black Africa and Madagascar, and also to Algeria.

The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party emphasized that from de Gaulle's trip to Africa, the French people and the working class have more clearly realized the effective support of the people of overseas territories for them, and thus are more determined to strengthen their active support for the liberation struggle of the people of the colonies and more determined to oppose de Gaulle's policies.

The statement concluded: For the sake of France's interests, dignity, great future, and its prestige in the world, the French masses must reject de Gaulle's "constitution" in the September 28th plebiscite.

    反对戴高乐“宪法”草案　争取和维护民主权利
　　法国抗议示威运动声势壮大
　　法共号召人民在9月28日投反对票
    据新华社巴黎30日电　劳动人民反对戴高乐“宪法”草案的运动声势日益壮大。
    法国总工会铁路员工联合会号召全体铁路员工踊跃参加从9月4日起在各地先后举行的示威游行，以表示反对戴高乐、坚决争取满足自己的权利要求和决心拥护共和制度。
    法国总工会运输业工会联合会也号召各地工会组织和企业工会支部以及全体运输工人展开争取实现权利要求的斗争，并且进行讨论，以便说服自己的亲友在“全民投票”时投反对票；同时应该积极参加为此目的而进行的一切示威游行，以便挫败暂时在国内非法执政的反动势力。
    法国总工会食品、旅馆和饮食业工会联合会要求全体职工参加各地为反对戴高乐的巡回宣传活动而举行的示威游行，并且在即将到来的“全民投票”中投反对票。
    鲁昂的建筑工人一致通过决议，决定投否决票。格朗—顾隆纳的建筑工人也通过了同样的决议。
    新华社巴黎30日电　法国共产党中央委员会政治局就戴高乐最近在非洲为他的“宪法”草案争取支持的旅行发表声明说：可以从戴高乐这次旅行中得出若干重要教训：
    一、一个强大的、无可扭转的解放运动席卷非洲和马达加斯加。
    二、戴高乐完全无视现实。他执政三个月以来的经验证明他完全没有能力解决非洲人的问题。
    三、在目前的情况下，考虑到殖民地各国人民解放运动的发展，唯有承认这些国家的人民的独立，才能在平等、自由同意和互利的基础上同他们建立有益的、友好的和巩固的关系。这个解决办法适用于黑非洲和马达加斯加，也适用于阿尔及利亚。
    法国共产党政治局强调指出，从戴高乐的非洲之行中，法国人民和工人阶级更加明确地体会到海外属地各国人民对他们的有效的支援，从而更加坚决地要加强他们对殖民地各国人民的解放斗争的积极声援，更加坚决地反对戴高乐的政策。
    声明最后说：为了法国的利益、尊严、伟大前途和它在世界上的威望，法国人民群众要在9月28日的公民投票中否决戴高乐的“宪法”。
