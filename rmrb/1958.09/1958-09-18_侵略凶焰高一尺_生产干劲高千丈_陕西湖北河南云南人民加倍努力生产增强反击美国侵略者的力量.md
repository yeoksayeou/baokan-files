Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 17th: Farmers in various parts of Shaanxi Province are launching an even greater production upsurge to fight back against the American imperialists' military provocations in the Taiwan Strait and their repeated acts of banditry in invading our territorial airspace and waters.

    Members of people's communes in more than 30 counties including Xianyang and Weinan, under the slogan "The field is the battlefield, the hoe is the sword, step up production, fight back against the American wolf," are vigorously engaging in deep plowing and manure accumulation campaigns. Sixteen communes in Weinan County, starting from the 7th, fought day and night, doubling the amount of deep plowing and manure accumulation compared to the previous few days. The province is deep plowing more than 500,000 mu daily, to a depth of one foot to one zhang. Manure accumulation has reached more than 1,200 billion jin. More than 700,000 mu of wheat already sown in more than 30 counties in northern Shaanxi and the Loess Plateau have received four to five times more base fertilizer than last year. More than 2.5 million young people throughout the province, under the slogan "Producing one more jin of grain increases our strength to fight back against the enemy by one point," are vigorously developing satellite high-yield fields. More than 800,000 young people in 20 counties including Fuping and Xingping have organized more than 20,000 satellite field professional teams, working day and night in the satellite fields. Young people throughout the province are determined to cultivate more than one million mu of high-yield wheat fields next year, with a total output of 6.5 billion jin, sending thousands of "satellites" into the sky. Farmers in Jingyang, Sanyuan, and other areas in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area have begun picking cotton. Women have proposed, "Pick it clean, sell the cotton to the state as soon as possible, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan!"

    While vigorously engaging in autumn production, farmers throughout the province are also doing everything possible to attack iron and steel production, using practical actions to severely strike the American wolf. More than 800,000 people throughout the province have been organized to climb mountains and cross ridges to find iron ore. From September 13th to 15th, the entire party and people of Chang'an County worked hard for three days and nights, building more than 940 indigenous blast furnaces. The county established a steel field army of more than 40,000 people and a steel guerrilla force of more than 100,000 people, working together. They are determined to produce 1,000 tons of pig iron in more than ten days to support national construction and fight back against the American imperialists' military provocations.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th: The broad masses of farmers in Hubei Province are strengthening the management of autumn fields, vigorously engaging in deep plowing of land and manure accumulation campaigns, and building indigenous blast furnaces with soaring enthusiasm, using practical actions to fight back against the American aggressors' military provocations.

    Farmers in Jingzhou, Huanggang, Xiaogan, Enshi, Yichang, and Xiangyang prefectures have all put forward specific plans to fight back against American aggressors with practical actions, and are actively taking measures to ensure the realization of these plans. Farmers in Jiangling County proposed to guarantee a grain yield of 3,000 jin per mu and a cotton yield of 300 jin per mu. He Zhishan, commander of the Chengguan District Production Command in Macheng County, and others proposed that, in order to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan, the number of iron-smelting furnaces will be increased from 55 to 100, the late rice crop will be increased from 1,500 jin to 3,000 jin per mu, the second late rice crop will be increased from 1,300 jin to 2,000 jin per mu, and the cotton crop will be increased from 1,000 jin to 1,500 jin of seed cotton per mu. The Hongqi People's Commune in Yingcheng County has launched a production upsurge throughout the commune, organizing more than 20,000 people to eliminate third-class seedlings and topdressing more than 11,000 mu; and organizing more than 6,000 people to carry out land deep plowing. Guan Musheng, director of the Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaogan County and a national model agricultural worker, after seeing Premier Zhou's statement, led the members of the cooperative in vigorously engaging in deep plowing of land and manure accumulation campaigns. In the past four days, the entire cooperative has deeply plowed 150 mu of land to more than two chi, with the deepest reaching four to five chi. At the same time, the entire cooperative mobilized more than 300 people to accumulate manure every day, averaging more than 100,000 dan of various fertilizers per day, while in the past, the most they could accumulate was more than 10,000 dan per day. In addition, they also topdressed more than 150 mu of late rice that was not growing well and eliminated rice borers. More than 50,000 people from the Huopai Liaoyuan People's Commune and the Yuzhou People's Commune in Xiangyang County swore to Chairman Mao at a rally that they would race against time and vigorously promote current production. In recent days, the two communes have launched a campaign for everyone to accumulate 20 dan of fertilizer, accumulating 110,000 carts of fertilizer in just one night. The Huojian People's Commune also launched a campaign for everyone to donate scrap iron, donating more than 3,000 jin of scrap iron in one night.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th: The broad masses of farmers in Henan Province, angered by the armed provocations of American imperialism, have launched a "grand production demonstration" movement in the past few days with great speed and vigor. At present, there is a deep plowing army of 10 million people in the province, warning American imperialism not to play with fire and burn themselves, while deeply plowing the land and stepping up production. They are singing self-composed songs with great enthusiasm: "Set up a large camp in the fields, build sheds everywhere, deep plow the land day and night, bury the American soldiers."

    Shangqiu Prefecture increased from 350,000 mu plowed per day in the past to 520,000 mu. Yang Mingcheng, a 73-year-old farmer in Daokou Township, Shangqiu County, is not showing weakness either, plowing eight fen of land a day. He said, I am old but my heart is not old, I guarantee to build socialism well, produce more grain to liberate Taiwan, I will work hard even if it costs my old life. In Shuishui County, 73,000 young people and women moved their homes to the fields in order to plow the land, eating in the fields and living in the fields, fighting day and night, plowing a total of more than 61,000 mu in four days, all at a depth of more than two chi. While deep plowing the land, the masses also have a particularly strong enthusiasm for accumulating manure. In Xuchang County, 82,000 manure accumulation troops were dispatched. Under the slogan "Accumulate more fertilizer, produce more grain, and have the strength to liberate Taiwan," they accumulated more than 15 million carts of fertilizer in one day and night, averaging 182 carts per person, increasing work efficiency more than ten times compared to normal.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 16th: The people of all ethnic groups in the border areas of Yunnan Province, angered by the military provocations of American imperialism, are closely united around the Party, stepping up the autumn harvest and autumn planting, and using practical actions to fight back against the American aggressors.

Farmers of all ethnic groups in Mengyong District also rushed to repair ditches and build embankments overnight. Dai and Va farmers in Mangzheng and other townships have changed their past habit of harvesting only when the millet is all yellow, and are now starting to harvest day and night, planning to finish harvesting in ten days. Jinping County in Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture organized a large army of 100,000 people, and after a day and night of hard work, harvested 60,000 mu of corn and 10,000 mu of mid-season rice, accounting for more than 95% of the county's mature grain area, achieving quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick drying, quick storage, and returning every grain home. Farmers in Simao County, Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture, accumulated 2.81 billion jin of green manure in one day on the 8th. Farmers in Puer County had weeded the second crop of late rice on the 7th and 8th. Farmers in Jingdong County not only completed the third earthing-up of sugarcane, but also completed 78.9% of the fourth earthing-up.

    Militia of all ethnic groups in the border areas of Yunnan are also stepping up military training.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 16th: After 25 days of valiant and arduous struggle, workers at the Inner Mongolia Second Machinery Manufacturing Plant successfully trial-produced a set of rolling mills with an annual output of 30,000 tons of steel on the 14th. It can roll square steel, round steel, and angle steel.

    This set of rolling mills started feeding materials on August 20th, and was originally planned to be completed before National Day, but the American imperialists' military provocations in the Taiwan Strait aroused the anger of the workers throughout the plant. The workers overcame various difficulties with unparalleled enthusiasm, using practical actions to fight back against the American imperialists' provocations, and completed the manufacturing task of all rolling mills 15 days ahead of schedule.

    This set of rolling mills is the first set of rolling mills manufactured by workers of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia with their own hands.
