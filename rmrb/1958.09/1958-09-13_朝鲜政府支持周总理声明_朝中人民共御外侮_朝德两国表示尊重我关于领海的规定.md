Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 12th: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today, fully supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait.

The statement said that the Korean people, who have formed a blood-cemented relationship with the Chinese people in the common struggle against the American imperialist aggressors, cannot remain indifferent to the war adventures of the American imperialist aggressors against the Chinese people and disrupting peace in the Far East and the world. In the struggle against the war provocation schemes of the American imperialists and in defense of peace and security in Asia, the Korean people will always advance together with the Chinese people. Any provocative action against the Chinese people is also a serious threat to the Korean people.

The statement said that the provocative actions of the American aggressors in the Taiwan Strait must be stopped immediately, and American imperialism must get out of Taiwan immediately. If American imperialism continues to expand its provocative behavior against 600 million Chinese people, disregarding the warnings of the People's Republic of China and the unanimous opposition of peace-loving people all over the world, it will bring upon itself serious consequences leading to its own destruction.

The statement condemned the American imperialists for occupying China's territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands while instigating the Korean War.

The statement pointed out that recently, the American imperialists have not only concentrated their military forces in the Taiwan Strait, illegally infringing upon China's territorial waters and airspace, and continuing to support the Chiang Kai-shek clique, but are also viciously plotting to expand their scope of aggression to China's coastal islands.

The statement said that it is entirely China's internal affair and China's sacred and inviolable right for the Chinese people to exercise their sovereignty in order to liberate their territory of Taiwan and coastal islands.

Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: Li Yong-ho, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, delivered a note to Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, on the 11th. The note said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fully supports the People's Republic of China's statement on territorial waters and believes that the 12-nautical-mile territorial waters width stipulated in this statement is legitimate.

The note said that the Korean government confirms that the statement issued by China on territorial waters applies to all territories of China, including mainland China and its coastal islands, Taiwan and its surrounding islands, the Penghu Islands, and other islands belonging to China.

The note said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will accurately abide by this decision.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 12th: The government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement today, expressing its full support for the statement of the government of the People's Republic of China on territorial waters. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic has delivered a note on this statement to the Chinese Embassy in Berlin at noon today.

The statement believes that the People's Republic of China's stipulation that the width of its territorial waters is 12 nautical miles is a legitimate step taken by a sovereign country that fully complies with international law.

The government of the German Democratic Republic fully agrees with the view expressed in the statement of the government of the People's Republic of China on territorial waters that the liberation of Taiwan and Penghu and other places is the sovereignty and internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.

    声明说，在反对美帝国主义侵略者的共同斗争中，同中国人民结成了血肉相连的关系的朝鲜人民，对美帝国主义侵略者反对中国人民和扰乱远东和世界和平的战争冒险绝不能置若罔闻。在反对美帝国主义者的战争挑衅阴谋和维护亚洲和平和安全的斗争中，朝鲜人民将永远同中国人民一起前进。反对中国人民的任何挑衅行动也都是对朝鲜人民的严重威胁。
    声明说，必须立即制止美国侵略者在台湾海峡进行的挑衅行动，美帝国主义必须立即从台湾滚出去。美帝国主义如果不顾中华人民共和国的警告和全世界爱好和平人民的一致反对，竟然继续扩大反对六亿中国人民的挑衅行为的话，它将招来自取灭亡的严重后果。
    声明谴责美帝国主义者在挑起朝鲜侵略战争的同时，强占了中国的领土台湾和澎湖列岛。
    声明指出，最近，美帝国主义者不仅把他们的军事力量集中在台湾海峡，非法地侵犯中国的领海和领空，继续支援蒋介石集团，而且还在凶恶地策划把它的侵略范围扩大到中国沿海岛屿。
    声明说，中国人民为了解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿，行使自己的主权，这完全属于中国内政问题，是中国神圣不可侵犯的权利。

    照会说，朝鲜政府确认：中国发表的关于领海的声明，适用于中国的一切领土，包括中国大陆及其沿海岛屿和台湾及其周围各岛、澎湖列岛以及属于中国的其它岛屿。
    照会说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府将准确地遵守这一决定。
    据新华社柏林12日电　德意志民主共和国政府今天发表声明，表示完全支持中华人民共和国政府关于领海的声明。德意志民主共和国外交部已在今天中午把关于这项声明的照会交给中国驻柏林大使馆。
    声明认为，中华人民共和国规定领海宽度为十二海里，这是一个主权国家所采取的完全符合国际公法的正当步骤。
    德意志民主共和国政府完全同意中华人民共和国政府关于领海的声明中所指出的这样的意见：解放台湾和澎湖等地是中华人民共和国的主权和内政。
