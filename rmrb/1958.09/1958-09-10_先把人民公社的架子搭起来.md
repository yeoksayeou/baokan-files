　　First Put Up the Framework of the People's Commune

A mass movement to run people's communes is already underway throughout the country. After Chairman Mao inspected Hebei, Henan, and Shandong, praising the local farmers' initiative in running people's communes and pointing out that this is the direction for China's 500 million farmers to continue to advance, the peasant masses were greatly encouraged and quickly launched a nationwide upsurge in running people's communes. Tens of thousands of letters of determination and big-character posters demanded approval to establish communes, celebrating the establishment of communes with gongs and drums. The peasants' eagerness is understandable. This is the result of the comprehensive and continuous leap forward in agricultural production in our country and the increasingly high political awareness of the 500 million peasants. The current issue before us is that running people's communes is a new issue, and there is a lack of sufficient experience; the struggle to win a bumper harvest of autumn crops is in full swing; the iron and steel front demands a more arduous battle. Properly arranging these fundamental tasks is an important key to achieving a comprehensive victory in our great leap forward this year.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's resolution on the establishment of people's communes in rural areas not only clearly pointed out the roots of the people's commune movement, the nature and future of people's communes, but also clearly pointed out the correct steps that should be taken in the current work of establishing communes.

In the current rural areas, the tasks are very heavy. It is necessary not only to run the people's communes well, but also to transfer a large number of laborers to support the iron and steel front; it is necessary not only to vigorously grasp the management of autumn fields to ensure a greater autumn harvest, but also to immediately prepare for a series of autumn harvesting and planting work; at the same time, the purchase and transfer of agricultural products must be done well, and autumn afforestation, eliminating the four pests, etc. must also be carried out in combination. After the United States expanded its scope of aggression in the Taiwan Strait area, the peasants across the country, like the urban population across the country, were involved in the wave of opposing American military provocations and war threats, and the work of strengthening the militia and arming the whole people will also accelerate. Which link should be grasped in order to properly arrange these tasks? According to the existing experience in various places, the best way is to firmly grasp the center of running people's communes, and when running the communes, as the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China said, to put up the framework of the people's communes as soon as possible. Grasping this link can smoothly drive other tasks. Under the current conditions where various places have pilot experience, it is entirely possible to do so.

In many places, with the development of communization, a new production upsurge has been set off, which has not only created a new situation on the agricultural front, but also transferred a large number of laborers to the industrial front to engage in iron and steel production. For example, Henan originally planned to complete the accumulation of 3 trillion catties of fertilizer before autumn. In the communization movement, it not only completed this task, but also overfulfilled 2 trillion catties, and is currently moving towards a new indicator; after Hebei basically communized, it not only greatly strengthened the strength of all aspects of the agricultural front, but also transferred hundreds of thousands of laborers to the mountains to engage in iron and steel production. The situation in many prefectures and counties that have already been communized is also the same. This shows that grasping the center of the people's commune movement—first putting up the commune framework—is beneficial. Once the people's commune is established, the masses are elated and have more energy. They regard running the people's commune as "going to the next level" and express that "joining the commune means being willing to go up the mountains and into the ground." With such enthusiasm from the broad masses, what tasks cannot be arranged well? In fact, with the establishment of the commune, not only is the enthusiasm of the masses higher, but it is also easier to uniformly allocate labor and utilize resources in all aspects to ensure a double harvest of grain and steel. Some places only worry that running a commune will affect the current production, so they plan to postpone the steps of running a commune, which is likely to affect the enthusiasm of the masses and may be detrimental to the current production.

We say that the current rural work should grasp the central link of the people's commune, not to require the immediate and thorough solution of all the problems of the people's commune, but to say that we should first put up the framework. The Central Committee's resolution said: "In the early stage of merging communes, the method of 'the top moving and the bottom not moving' can be adopted. First, the original small cooperatives should jointly elect the management committee of the large commune, set up the framework, and uniformly plan and deploy the work. The original small cooperatives should be changed into cultivation areas or production teams. The original set of production organization and management system should remain unchanged temporarily and operate as usual. Everything that should be merged and adjusted and the specific problems that should be solved in the merger will be gradually merged, gradually cleaned up, and gradually resolved in the future to ensure that production is not affected." This means that the commune committee should be established according to the plan, uniformly allocate labor, and uniformly make plans (including the proportion of infrastructure, production, and public accumulation, etc.), and carry out various tasks separately under the unified leadership of the commune; the original labor organization, accounting unit, distribution plan, financial processing, etc., should remain unchanged temporarily. This method is good and feasible, because it can both meet the masses' requirements for running a commune, solve the difficulty of labor allocation, and not excessively constrain the leadership force.

Of course, the so-called first putting up the framework does not mean that it can be done simply, and a simple decision can be made by a few cadres and activists without full ideological mobilization, nor does it mean that the various policies related to the people's commune can be kept from the masses, or that they can be handled arbitrarily. The process of setting up the framework must be a process of fully mobilizing the masses, and it must be a process of carrying out socialist and communist ideological education for the masses. Running the people's commune is a struggle to further organize and finally eliminate the remnants of private ownership of the means of production. It not only includes the ideological struggle between the two roads, including the ideological struggle against departmentalism and individualism, but also includes the struggle against the right-leaning conservative thinking of party members and cadres who reflect the above ideas. At the same time, we must also be vigilant against the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, bad elements, and counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, the questions of why and how to run the people's commune must be carried out in a great contention among the masses. In the entire process of running the commune, we must rely closely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, overcome the wavering of the upper-middle peasants, expose and defeat the rumors and sabotage of the landlords and rich peasants, and unite the broad masses of peasants to run the people's commune on the basis of voluntary participation.

The Central Committee's resolution has made clear provisions on various economic policy issues related to the people's commune. Various localities have already gained some initial experience in this regard. The draft trial regulations of the Weixing People's Commune in Suiping, Henan, published in this newspaper on September 4, can also be used as a reference for handling this aspect of the problem. Generally speaking, the means of production that are still privately owned should be transferred to the ownership of the commune; the means of personal subsistence must be resolutely untouched, and it should be made clear to the masses; some things that can be said to be both means of production and means of subsistence, such as a few pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, and sporadic fruit trees, etc., should generally not be touched in a hurry; the property and public accumulation of the original agricultural cooperatives should be transferred to the commune, and no one is allowed to handle them arbitrarily; the shares and funds of the commune members will be handled after one or two years when production has been further developed and the awareness of the masses has been further improved. When handling it, it must also be fully discussed by the masses and handled according to the opinions of the masses. Existing experience has proven that these policy issues are important issues and are also issues of concern to the broad masses. Handling them is more troublesome and requires a certain period of brewing. Therefore, when setting up the framework, there is no need to rush to handle them. However, the principles for handling these issues should be brought up to the masses as soon as possible, and the sooner the policies meet the masses, the better, and the deeper the ideological mobilization, the better, otherwise it is easy to cause some unnecessary confusion.

After the framework of the people's commune is set up, the higher enthusiasm of the masses should be quickly organized into the current production. In some places, as soon as the commune was established, the overall plan and goals of the commune were announced, and a new campaign to win a bumper harvest was organized, showing the power of the commune, greatly inspiring the people, and achieving good results.

At present, places that have been communized should combine production with consolidation work. Some places have adopted measures such as grasping production, grasping ideology, grasping policies, grasping management, and grasping the lives of the masses to consolidate the people's commune, which is a good method.

The people's commune movement in our country is developing vigorously, and the movement is developing both rapidly and healthily. In the current rural work, as long as we grasp the center of running the people's commune to arrange various tasks, we will be able to run the people's commune quickly and well, and we will be able to complete the current tasks quickly and well, and obtain a harvest that is greater than the summer harvest.

### 先把人民公社的架子搭起来

　　先把人民公社的架子搭起来
    一个大办人民公社的全民运动，已经在全国范围内开展起来了。在毛主席视察河北、河南、山东，表扬了当地农民办人民公社的创举，指出这是我国五亿多农民继续前进的方向以后，农民群众受到了巨大的鼓舞，迅速掀起了全国规模的举办人民公社的热潮。成千上万张决心书、大字报，要求批准办公社，敲锣打鼓，热烈庆祝公社成立。农民这种迫不及待的心情是可以理解的。这正是我国农业生产全面地不断地跃进和五亿多农民政治觉悟愈来愈高的结果。当前摆在我们面前的问题是：办人民公社是个新的问题，还缺乏足够的经验；争取秋季作物大丰收的斗争，正在紧张进行；钢铁战线上要求展开更加艰巨的战斗。妥善地把这几项根本任务安排好，是使我们今年大跃进获得全面胜利的重要关键。
    中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议，不但明确地指出了人民公社运动的根源，人民公社的性质和前途，而且明确地指出了目前在建立公社工作中所应当采取的正确步骤。
    在目前的农村中，任务是十分繁重的。既要把人民公社办好，又要抽调大批劳力支援钢铁战线；既要大力抓紧秋田管理，保证秋季更大丰收，又要立即作好秋收秋种一系列的准备工作；同时农产品的收购、调运工作必须作好，秋季造林、除四害等也必须结合进行。美国在台湾海峡地区扩大侵略范围以后，全国农民也同全国城市人口一样，卷入了反对美国军事挑衅和战争威胁的浪潮，加强民兵、武装全民的工作也将加速发展。应该抓住哪个环节，才能把这些工作安排妥当呢？根据各地现有经验，最好的办法是紧紧地抓住办人民公社这个中心，而在办公社的时候，又应当如中共中央的决议所说，尽快地把人民公社的架子搭起来。抓住了这一环，就可以顺利地带动其它各项工作。在当前各地已经有了试点经验的条件下，这样作是完全可能的。
    不少地方随着公社化的发展，又掀起了一个新的生产高潮，不仅在农业战线出现了新的局面，而且抽调了大批劳力投入工业战线，大搞钢铁。例如河南原定秋前完成积肥三万亿斤，在公社化运动中，不仅完成了这个任务，而且超额完成两万亿斤，当前正在向着一个新的指标前进；河北基本公社化以后，不仅大大加强了农业战线各个方面的力量，而且抽调了几十万劳动力上山大搞钢铁。许多已经公社化的专区、县的情况，也是如此。这说明抓住人民公社运动这个中心——先把公社架子搭起来，是有利的。人民公社一办起来，群众兴高彩烈，干劲更足，他们把办了人民公社看做是“更上一层楼”，表示“参加了公社，上山入地都情愿”。广大群众有了这样的劲头，还有什么工作不好安排呢？事实上，办了公社，不仅群众的积极性更高了，而且也更便于统一调配劳力和利用各方面的资源，保证粮食、钢铁双丰收。个别地方仅仅因为怕办公社影响当前生产，就打算把办公社的步骤加以推迟，这样很可能使群众热情受到影响，对当前生产反而会不利的。
    我们说当前的农村工作要抓住人民公社这个中心环节，并不是要求立即把人民公社一系列的问题全部加以彻底解决，而是说先搭好架子。中央的决议说：“在并社初期可以采取‘上动下不动’的方法，首先由原来各小社联合选出大社的管理委员会，搭起架子，统一规划部署工作，把原来的各小社改为耕作区或者生产队，原来的一套生产组织和管理制度暂时不变，照常经营，一切应该合并调整的东西和合并中应该解决的具体问题，以后再逐步合并、逐步清理、逐步解决，以保证生产不受影响”。这就是说，先按规划把公社委员会建立起来，统一调配劳力，统一作好规划（包括基建、生产及公共积累的比例等），在公社的统一领导下分头进行各项工作；对原来的劳动组织、核算单位、分配方案、财务处理等等，暂时不动。这种方法是好的，可行的，因为这样既可以满足群众办公社的要求，解决劳动力调配的困难，又不会过多的牵制领导力量。
    当然，所谓先搭好架子，并不是说可以简单从事，不经过充分的思想发动而由少数干部、积极分子简单决定就行了，也不是说有关人民公社的各项政策可以不同群众见面，或自作主张地乱加处理。搭架子的过程必须是一个充分发动群众的过程，必须是一个向群众进行社会主义和共产主义思想教育的过程。办人民公社是一场进一步组织起来并且最后消灭生产资料私有制残余的斗争，它不仅包括着两条道路的思想斗争，包括着对于本位主义和个人主义的思想斗争，而且还包括着向反映以上这些思想的党员、干部的右倾保守思想的斗争，同时，也还必须警惕地主、富农分子、坏分子以及反革命分子的破坏活动。因此，关于为什么办和怎样办人民公社的问题，都必须在群众中进行大鸣大放大辩论。在办公社的全部过程中，都必须紧紧依靠贫农和下中农，克服上中农的动摇，揭穿和击退地主富农的造谣破坏，团结广大农民在自觉自愿的基础上来办人民公社。
    有关人民公社的各项经济政策问题，中央的决议已经作了明确的规定。各地在这一方面已经有了一些初步的经验，本报9月4日发表的河南遂平卫星人民公社试行简章（草案），也可以作为处理这方面问题的参考。一般地说，目前仍然私有的生产资料应当转为公社所有；个人生活资料必须坚决不动，并且应当向群众说明清楚；有些既可以说是生产资料也可以说是生活资料的，如少数的猪、羊、鸡、鸭和零星果木等，一般也不要忙于去动它；原来农业合作社的财产和公共积累，应当转入公社，一律不许自作处理；社员的股份基金，过一、二年生产有了更大的发展，群众的觉悟进一步提高以后，再作处理。在处理的时候，也必须经过群众充分讨论，根据群众的意见去办。已有的经验证明：这些政策性的问题都是重要的问题，也都是为广大群众所关心的问题，处理比较费事，须要有一定的酝酿过程，因此，在搭架子的时候，一律不必忙于处理。但是应当把处理这些问题的原则，及早提出来同群众见面，而且政策和群众见面得愈早愈好，思想发动得愈深透愈好，否则反容易引起一些不必要的混乱。
    人民公社的架子搭起来以后，就应当立即把群众更加高涨的积极性迅速组织到当前生产中去。有的地方公社一成立就宣布公社的全面规划和奋斗目标，组织争取丰收的新的战役，显示公社威力，大大地振奋了人心，收到了良好的效果。
    目前已经公社化了的地方，都要结合生产进行巩固工作。有的地方采取抓生产、抓思想、抓政策、抓管理、抓群众生活等项措施，来巩固人民公社，是一个好办法。
    我国人民公社运动正在蓬勃发展，运动发展得既迅速又健康。在当前的农村工作中，只要抓住了办人民公社这个中心来安排各项工作，就一定能够又快又好地办好人民公社，一定能够又快又好地完成当前各项任务，获得一个比夏季更大的丰收。
