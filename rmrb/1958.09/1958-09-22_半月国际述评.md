    Half-Monthly International Review
    (From September 5th to September 19th)
    The flames of anti-aggression are burning across the land. The United States' blatant provocation against the Chinese people following its aggression in the Middle East has aroused great anger among the Chinese people. The just struggle of the Chinese people to resolutely counter U.S. provocations and demand the liberation of their territory has received strong support from the socialist camp and peace-loving people of all countries. The United States is in an unprecedentedly isolated position and is moving from one failure to another, newer and greater failure.
    The anti-aggression struggles of the Arab people and the Chinese people have powerfully promoted the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria is another major victory in the anti-colonialist struggle. The Prime Ministers of French Guinea and Niger have declared that they will announce independence. The French people are also waging a struggle against De Gaulle's dictatorial constitution.
    Amidst the massive anti-aggression and anti-colonialist struggle, the 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly has opened. The UN General Assembly must take on the responsibility of stopping aggression and maintaining peace.
    The Huge Storm of Anti-Aggression
    The new U.S. military provocations in the Taiwan Strait are a planned and reckless step. When the U.S. plan to expand its aggression in the Middle East was defeated, it began by directing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to carry out harassment, while ordering the Seventh Fleet and U.S. naval forces in Japan and other areas of the Far East to take so-called "preventive defense measures." After our heroic artillery forces gave a head-on blow to the provocations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and placed Jinmen under artillery blockade, the U.S. aggressors clamored loudly, mobilized troops and dispatched large numbers of warships, aircraft, ground troops, and missile units from their home country and the Mediterranean to strengthen the Seventh Fleet. Dulles and Eisenhower openly clamored one after another to use force to "defend" our territory of Jinmen and Mazu, expanding the scope of their aggression against our country. U.S. aggressive forces have continuously violated our territorial waters and formed "escort convoys" to "escort" Chiang's military ships to Jinmen. This is the most dangerous military adventure by the United States since World War II. It is making the dangerous situation in the Taiwan Strait increasingly serious, threatening peace in the Far East and the world.
    Chairman Mao pointed out at the Supreme State Conference on September 8th: "The territories of Taiwan, Lebanon, and all U.S. military bases in foreign countries are nooses around the neck of U.S. imperialism." Premier Zhou Enlai also sternly warned the U.S. aggressors: "If the U.S. government recklessly disregards the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world, continues to carry out aggression and interference against China, and imposes war on the Chinese people, the U.S. government must bear all the serious consequences arising therefrom." Chairman Mao's words are inspiring. The Chinese people warmly support the government's statement and have launched an unprecedented anti-aggression storm. More than 300 million people have held unprecedented large-scale demonstrations. The angry Chinese people are mobilized, and the artillery fire punishing the Chiang troops in Jinmen and the Chiang military ships protected by the United States has already been fired. This is a solemn response to the U.S. aggressors.
    The just struggle of the Chinese people has received the support of the people of the whole world. Behind us is the powerful socialist camp. Khrushchev warned the U.S. aggressors that an attack on the People's Republic of China is an attack on the Soviet Union. Other fraternal socialist countries have also expressed their support for our country. The Arab people, who are continuing their struggle against U.S.-British aggression, have closely linked their struggle with the struggle of the Chinese people. The people of all countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America also condemn the U.S.'s arrogant provocation against the Chinese people.
    In contrast, U.S. imperialism is in an unprecedentedly isolated position. Many Western newspapers and periodicals, such as the British "Manchester Guardian," pointed out that no one except Syngman Rhee would fight alongside the United States for Jinmen and Mazu. Under pressure from British public opinion, a British government spokesman also stated that Britain "has not undertaken any obligations to the United States regarding the situation in the Far East." The heads of government of Canada, Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand have all stated that they do not want to be drawn into U.S. military adventures. The U.S. plot to use Japan and the Philippines as springboards for aggression against China has been fiercely opposed by the people of these countries. Even within the United States, the Washington authorities' adventurous policies are extremely unpopular. The American public and public opinion have widely condemned the government's dangerous policy of playing with fire.
    Under these extremely unfavorable circumstances, the United States has had to express its willingness to resolve the dispute between China and the United States in the Taiwan Strait through peaceful negotiations. Our government has consistently advocated resolving all international disputes through peaceful negotiations. The Sino-U.S. talks, which have lasted for more than two years and held seventy-three meetings, have failed to reach an agreement on resolving the disputes between the two countries entirely due to the U.S.'s obstruction in every possible way. Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on September 6th, while warning the United States to rein in at the precipice, pointed out that since the United States is willing to resolve the dispute through peaceful negotiations, our government is prepared to resume ambassadorial-level talks between the two countries in order to make another effort to maintain peace. Chairman Mao Zedong's speech at the Supreme State Conference also pointed out that if both sides have the sincerity to resolve the issue, the negotiations may achieve some results. Now, the Sino-U.S. talks, which were interrupted by the United States for more than eight months, have resumed in Warsaw. However, the United States is still stepping up its military threats and war deployments in the Taiwan Strait region, and is vigorously promoting the so-called "ceasefire," which does not exist at all between China and the United States. The United States is clearly attempting to use military threats and use negotiations to achieve the purpose of interfering in China's internal affairs, but this is doomed to failure. Foreign Minister Chen Yi sternly warned that the United States must immediately stop its provocations and get out of the Taiwan region. If the United States dares to impose war on the Chinese people, then our people will not hesitate to sacrifice and rise up to resist.
    U.S.-British Aggressive Forces Must Withdraw from the Middle East
    In the Near and Middle East, a new, sharp, and complex anti-aggression struggle is focused on striving to implement the resolutions of the UN General Assembly's emergency special session to force the U.S. and British troops to withdraw.
    At the end of August, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, in accordance with the resolution of the General Assembly, went to the Middle East to arrange for the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops. He successively arrived in Beirut, Amman, Cairo, Jerusalem, Baghdad, and then returned to Amman and Beirut to carry out activities. However, due to the obstruction of U.S. and British imperialism, Hammarskjöld made no progress in carrying out his mission.
    Since the General Assembly passed the resolution, the U.S. and British aggressors have tried their best to use their agents, Chamoun and Hussein, to use certain phrases in the General Assembly resolution to achieve the purpose of delaying the withdrawal of troops and disguised occupation. Chamoun and Hussein both clamored that unless they were guaranteed their so-called "independence" in advance and U.N. forces replaced the U.S. and British aggressive forces, the U.S. and Britain should not withdraw their troops. However, the clamoring of these two puppets cannot save their masters. Chamoun will step down on September 23, and the Lebanese opposition parties still firmly demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops; Hussein's small court, despite its bloody suppression of patriotic and democratic forces, is still in a precarious state. Therefore, "the dagger is revealed when the map is unrolled," and the U.S. and British aggressors used military provocations and intimidation. On August 25, the tank troops of the U.S. aggressive forces openly surrounded the Basta district of the Lebanese capital controlled by the rebel people, and its artillery forces occupied positions opposite the rebel army. The British aggressors' armed provocations in Jordan have never stopped. Not long ago, the British Air Force carried out barbaric bombing of areas east of the Jordan River. At the same time, British troops are continuously being reinforced.
    However, with the support of the socialist camp and the people of all countries in the world, the Arab people are firmly opposed to the U.S. and British conspiracy to delay the withdrawal of troops. President Nasser, in condemning the U.S. and Britain's delay in withdrawing troops on September 3, said that the Arab people are determined to struggle to achieve the guarantee of the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces. Baghdad Radio also published a commentary pointing out that it is necessary to resolutely force the imperialists to withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan as soon as possible. A communiqué from the leadership meeting of the Lebanese opposition parties demanded that Chehab implement the General Assembly resolution and be prepared to "end by force" the conspiracy aimed at preventing the withdrawal of U.S. troops.
    However, the United States is still playing a double game: on the one hand, it has to announce once again the withdrawal of some troops from Lebanon to ease the pressure of public opinion; on the other hand, it is rushing troops to the Mediterranean to strengthen its military deployment in the area around Lebanon. Dulles also openly stated on September 9 that the United States is only planning to "reduce" the troops in Lebanon "somewhat, but the time is not yet ripe to announce any definite plan for a complete withdrawal." The Arab people still need to carry out a resolute struggle to smash the U.S. political conspiracy to delay the withdrawal of troops.
    Fascist Clouds Loom Over France
    In mainland France and France's overseas territories, as September 28th draws closer, the struggle between anti-dictatorship and dictatorship, anti-colonialism and colonialism, is becoming increasingly fierce.
    On this day, the draft "Fifth Republic Constitution" proposed by De Gaulle will be put to a referendum. France faces the prospect of a dictatorial regime that paves the way for fascism, a regime that will implement militaristic rule in mainland France and overseas territories, ruthlessly suppress all democratic forces that oppose war and fascism, and intensify colonial wars, especially the dirty war being waged in Algeria.
    The French bourgeois ruling group and its darling De Gaulle have used all soft and hard tactics to try to conceal the fascist dictatorship and colonialist essence of the draft constitution, and use "not approving the draft constitution will lead to civil war" to intimidate the French people, and "not approving the draft constitution means splitting from France" to intimidate the people of overseas territories that have close economic ties with France. Precisely in order to carry out this deception and intimidation, De Gaulle made a 10,000-mile "trip" to France's African territories in the latter part of last month, and is now touring major cities in mainland France. De Gaulle has also decided to mobilize military police to implement "protection" voting in mainland France and "supervision" voting in Algeria. The bourgeois "right-wing parties" and the right-wing Socialist Party, which is actually an agent of the bourgeoisie, have also been mobilized to cheer for De Gaulle's "constitution" draft and lure affirmative votes.
    However, the movement against dictatorship and the colonialist constitution is vigorously developing in mainland France and overseas territories. Thousands of "Committees for the Defense of the Republic" have been established in various regions, enterprises, residential areas, and villages, and the people have responded to the provocations of the fascists with hundreds of demonstrations. The Algerian people have expressed their firm rejection of De Gaulle's draft constitution by establishing their own provisional government; the Prime Ministers of French Guinea and Niger have successively announced that they will vote against it on September 28 and become independent countries. Within the various political parties of the French bourgeoisie, there are also many people who have broken with their upper-level leaders and are resolutely fighting against the dictatorial constitution.
    The Struggle of the United Nations General Assembly
    The 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly opened in New York on September 16. This conference began under unusually tense international circumstances. Because the U.S. and Britain have been slow to implement the UN General Assembly's emergency special session's resolution requiring the two countries to withdraw their troops from Lebanon and the Middle East as soon as possible, the threat to peace in the Middle East has not been eliminated. Moreover, the United States is carrying out military provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait region in the Far East, creating a serious danger of war. Therefore, world public opinion believes that the United Nations is facing another serious test. Whether it can restore its credibility as an international organization for maintaining world peace will depend on whether this session of the General Assembly can effectively stop the imperialist policy of aggression and make resolutions on some issues related to world peace that are in line with the wishes of the people of all countries.
    Since the adjournment of the last session of the General Assembly more than half a year ago, the struggles of all countries against aggression, for peace, against colonialism, and for national independence have seen a huge surge, and this situation cannot but be reflected in the United Nations organization. Anti-aggression and anti-colonialism will become the characteristics of this session of the General Assembly. On the eve of the opening of the conference, public opinion in various countries called for an end to the war threats being carried out by the United States in the Far East. Calls for the General Assembly to urge the U.S. and Britain to withdraw their troops from the Middle East are also coming from all directions. In the General Committee's discussion of the agenda of the General Assembly, the sharp struggle between the two lines can also be clearly seen. Despite the colonialist forces' attempts to obstruct it, issues such as the Algerian issue and the Cyprus issue were passed and included in the agenda. Although the U.S., Britain, and other countries used their majority to force the General Assembly to discuss the so-called "situation in Hungary" issue, which aimed at poisoning the international atmosphere, their actions were opposed and criticized not only by the representatives of socialist countries. Moreover, the speeches of representatives of many countries in the general debate of the General Assembly were full of strong emotions against aggression and against colonialism.
    The issue of disarmament and eliminating the threat of war will also be an important item on this session of the General Assembly. The Soviet Union has put forward proposals on the cessation of nuclear tests and on banning the use of outer space for military purposes, removing foreign military bases on the territory of other countries, and implementing international cooperation in the study of outer space. At the same time, the Soviet Union has also specially submitted a memorandum on the issue of disarmament to the General Assembly, advocating reaching an agreement on partial measures for disarmament. In addition, it also requested the General Assembly to urgently discuss the proposal that the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France each reduce their military budgets by 10% to 15%. These positive steps taken by the Soviet Union to promote the realization of disarmament are certainly welcomed by the peace-loving people of all countries. If the U.S., Britain, France, and other Western countries do not take positive actions in response to these proposals of the Soviet Union, they will inevitably expose their true colors of unwillingness to disarm before the people of the world.

    半月国际述评
    （从九月五日到九月十九日）
    反侵略的怒火，烧遍大地。美国继侵略中东之后对中国人民进行的猖狂挑衅，引起了中国人民的极大愤怒。中国人民坚决反击美国挑衅、要求解放自己领土的正义斗争，得到了社会主义阵营和世界各国爱好和平人民的有力支持。美国陷于空前孤立的境地，正在从一个失败走向另一个新的更大的失败。
    阿拉伯人民、中国人民的反侵略斗争，有力地推动了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府成立了，这是反殖民主义斗争的又一重大胜利。法属几内亚和尼日尔总理声明将要宣布独立。法国人民也正在开展反对戴高乐独裁宪法的斗争。
    在声势浩大的反侵略、反殖民主义斗争的形势下，第十三届联合国大会开幕了。联大必须负起制止侵略、维护和平的责任来。
    反侵略的巨大风暴
    美国在台湾海峡的新的军事挑衅，是有计划的冒险步骤。美国在扩大侵略中东计划遭到失败时，就开始一面指使蒋介石集团进行骚扰，一面命令第七舰队和在日本及远东其他地区的美国海军部队采取所谓“预防性防御措施”。当我国英勇炮兵部队给予蒋介石集团的挑衅迎头痛击，把金门置于炮火封锁之下以后，美国侵略者竟大肆叫嚷，调兵遣将，从本国和地中海调派了大批军舰、飞机、地面部队和导弹部队，加强第七舰队。杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔公然先后叫嚣要用武力“保卫”我国领土金门马祖，扩大对我国的侵略范围。美国侵略部队竟不断侵犯我国领海，并组成“护航队”，“护送”蒋军舰船到金门。这是美国第二次世界大战以来最危险的军事冒险。它使台湾海峡地区的危险局势日益严重，威胁着远东和世界和平。
    毛主席9月8日在最高国务会议上指出：“中国领土台湾、黎巴嫩以及所有美国在外国的军事基地，都是套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索。”周恩来总理也严正警告美国侵略者：“如果美国政府悍然不顾中国人民的再三警告和世界人民的和平愿望，继续对中国进行侵略和干涉，把战争强加在中国人民的头上，美国政府必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果”。毛主席的话鼓舞人心。中国人民热烈拥护政府的声明，掀起了空前规模的反侵略风暴，三亿多人举行了空前规模的大示威。愤怒的中国人民动员起来了，严惩金门蒋军和受美国保护的蒋军舰船的炮火已经打响了。这是对于美国侵略者的严正答复。
    中国人民的正义斗争，得到了全世界人民的支持。在我们的背后的是强大的社会主义阵营。赫鲁晓夫警告美国侵略者：对中华人民共和国的侵犯就是对苏联的侵犯。其他兄弟社会主义国家也表示支持我国。正在继续进行反对美英侵略的阿拉伯各国人民，把他们的斗争同中国人民的斗争紧密地联系在一起。整个亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民也都谴责美国对中国人民的狂妄挑衅。
    与此相反，美帝国主义陷于空前孤立。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”等许多西方报刊指出：除了李承晚以外，没有人会为了金门和马祖而同美国并肩作战。在英国舆论的压力下，英国政府发言人也声明英国“并没有对美国承担关于远东局势的任何义务”。加拿大、泰国、澳大利亚和新西兰等国的政府首脑都已表示他们不希望卷入美国的军事冒险中去。美国利用日本和菲律宾作为侵略中国的跳板的阴谋活动，受到这些国家人民的激烈反对。即使在美国国内，华盛顿当局的冒险政策也是极不得人心的。美国的公众和舆论纷纷谴责政府的危险的玩火政策。
    美国在这种极端不利的形势下，不得不表示愿意通过和平谈判来解决中美两国在台湾海峡地区的争端。我国政府是一贯主张用和平谈判方法解决一切国际争端的。举行了两年多、开了七十三次会议的中美会谈，所以不能就解决两国争端达成协议，完全是由于美国的百般阻挠。周恩来总理9月6日的声明，在警告美国必须悬崖勒马的同时，指出美国既然愿意通过和平谈判解决争端，我国政府为了再一次进行维护和平的努力，准备恢复两国大使级谈判。毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上的讲话也指出：如果双方具有解决问题的诚意的话，谈判可能会取得某些成果。现在，被美国中断了八个多月的中美会谈在华沙复会了。但是，美国仍然加紧在台湾海峡地区进行军事威胁和战争部署，并大肆宣传应该实行在中美两国间根本不存在的所谓“停火”。美国显然企图使用军事威胁手段，利用谈判来达到干涉中国内政的目的，但这是注定要失败的。陈毅外长严正警告：美国必须立即停止挑衅，滚出台湾地区，如果美国胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，那末，我国人民将不惜牺牲，奋起抗战。
    美英侵略军必须撤出中东
    在中近东地区，一场新的尖锐而复杂的反侵略斗争，集中在争取实现联大紧急特别会议的决议，迫使美英撤军上面。
    8月底，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德根据联大决议，前往中东安排美英撤军。他先后到达贝鲁特、安曼、开罗、耶路撒冷、巴格达，然后又回到安曼和贝鲁特进行活动，但是由于美英帝国主义的阻挠，哈马舍尔德在执行他的任务方面没有获得什么进展。
    自从联大通过决议后，美英侵略者就竭力企图通过它们的代理人夏蒙和侯赛因，利用联大决议的某些字句来达到拖延撤军和变相占领的目的。夏蒙和侯赛因都叫嚷除非事先保证他们的所谓“独立”，并以联合国部队来代替美英侵略军，否则，美英就不应撤兵。但是，这两个傀儡的叫嚷并不能挽救他们的主子。夏蒙要在9月23日下台，黎巴嫩反对党派仍坚决要求美国撤军；侯赛因小朝廷尽管对爱国民主力量进行血腥镇压，也仍然处于风雨飘摇之中。因此，“图穷而匕首见”，美英侵略者使出了军事挑衅和恫吓手段。8月25日，美国侵略军的坦克部队公然包围了黎巴嫩首都起义人民控制的巴斯塔区，它的炮兵部队占据了起义军对面的阵地。英国侵略者在约旦的武装挑衅活动也从未停止过。不久前英国空军竟对约旦河以东的地区进行了野蛮的轰炸。与此同时，英军源源增援。
    但是，在社会主义阵营和世界各国人民的支持下，阿拉伯人民坚决反对美英拖延撤军的阴谋。纳赛尔总统9月3日在谴责美英拖延撤军时表示：阿拉伯人民决心为实现使占领军立即撤走的保证而进行斗争。巴格达电台也发表评论指出，必须坚决地迫使帝国主义者尽快从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军。黎巴嫩反对党派领袖会议公报，要求谢哈布实现联大决议，并准备“用武力结束”目的在于阻止美军撤退的阴谋。
    可是，美国仍在玩弄两面手法：一方面不得不宣布再一次从黎巴嫩撤走一部分军队，以缓和舆论的压力；另方面又赶派部队到地中海，加强在黎巴嫩周围地区的军事部署。杜勒斯9月9日还公然表示：目前美国只是打算把在黎巴嫩的军队“减少一些，但要宣布任何全部撤退的确定计划，时机还没有成熟。”阿拉伯人民还需要进行坚决的斗争，粉碎美国拖延撤军的政治阴谋活动。
    法西斯乌云笼罩着法国
    在法国本土和法国海外属地上，随着9月28日这个日子的日益迫近，反独裁和独裁、反殖民主义和殖民主义之间的斗争正日益剧烈起来。
    在这一天，戴高乐所提出的“第五共和国宪法”草案将付诸公民投票表决。法国面临这样的一个前景：出现一个为法西斯主义开辟道路的独裁政权，这一政权将在法国本土和海外属地实行军国主义的统治，无情地镇压一切反对战争、反对法西斯的民主力量，加紧进行殖民战争首先是加剧在阿尔及利亚进行的肮脏战争。
    法国资产阶级统治集团和它的宠儿戴高乐使用了一切软硬兼施的手段，竭力掩饰宪法草案的法西斯独裁和殖民主义实质，并用“不赞成宪法草案就要爆发内战”来恫吓法国人民，用“不赞成宪法草案就是和法国分裂”来恫吓那些在经济上同法国有密切关系的海外属地的人民。正是为了实行这种欺骗和恫吓，戴高乐在上月下旬到非洲法国各属地进行了一万英里的“旅行”，现在又正巡行法国本土各大城市。戴高乐还决定动员军警在法国本土实行“保护”投票，在阿尔及利亚实行“监视”投票。资产阶级的“右翼党派”和实际上是资产阶级代理人的右翼社会党也被动员起来为戴高乐的“宪法”草案摇旗呐喊，诱骗赞成票。
    但是，反对独裁和殖民主义宪法的运动，正在法国本土和海外属地蓬勃地开展起来。数以千计的“保卫共和国委员会”在各地、各企业、各居民区、各村落中建立了起来，人民以千百次的示威来回答法西斯分子的挑衅。阿尔及利亚人民以成立自己的临时政府，来表示对戴高乐宪法草案的坚决拒绝；法属几内亚和尼日尔的总理已先后宣布将在9月28日投反对票并成为独立国家。法国资产阶级各政党内部，也有不少人同他们的上层领导决裂，坚决为反对独裁宪法而斗争。
    联合国大会的斗争
    联合国大会第十三届会议9月16日在纽约开幕。这次大会是在国际局势异常紧张的情况下开始的。由于美英两国迟迟不执行联大紧急特别会议要求两国早日从黎巴嫩和中东撤军的决议，对中东和平的威胁迄未消除，而美国又在远东的台湾海峡地区对中国人民进行军事挑衅，造成了严重的战争危险。因此世界舆论莫不认为联合国正面临又一次严重的考验，它是否能够恢复作为一个维护世界和平的国际机构的信誉，将取决于本届大会能否有效地制止帝国主义的侵略政策，并且就一些关系世界和平的问题作出符合各国人民愿望的决议。
    自从上届联大闭幕半年多以来，各国反对侵略、争取和平、反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争有了巨大的高涨，这种形势不可能不反映到联合国机构里来。反侵略和反殖民主义势将成为本届大会的特点。在大会开幕的前夕，各国舆论就纷纷要求制止美国在远东进行的战争威胁。要求大会促令美英从中东撤军的呼声也正起自四方。在大会总务委员会讨论大会议程的当中，也可以清楚地看到两条路线的尖锐斗争，尽管殖民主义势力百般阻挠，像阿尔及利亚问题和塞浦路斯问题等还是被通过列入议程。美英等国虽然挟持多数强迫大会讨论目的在于毒化国际气氛的所谓“关于匈牙利局势”问题，但是它们的做法遭到了不仅是社会主义国家的代表的反对和抨击。而许多国家的代表在大会的一般性辩论中的发言，更是充满着反对侵略和反对殖民主义的强烈情绪。
    关于裁军和消除战争威胁的问题，也将是本届大会一项重要的项目，苏联已经提出关于停止核试验以及关于禁止使用宇宙空间达到军事目的、撤除在别国领土上的外国军事基地和在研究宇宙空间方面实行国际合作的建议，同时苏联还特别向大会提出了裁军问题的备忘录，主张就裁军的局部措施达成协议，另外还要求大会紧急讨论苏美英法四国各削减军事预算10％到15％的建议。苏联这些促进实现裁军的积极步骤，肯定是受到各国爱好和平人民的欢迎的。美英法等西方国家对于苏联的这些建议不是采取积极响应的行动，就必然要在世界人民面前彻底暴露它们不愿裁军的真面目。
