    Strive for Large-Area High Yield

    The provinces of Hebei and Henan are striving to become provinces with 1,000 jin of wheat per mu next year. This is an encouraging piece of news and a prelude to an even greater leap forward in China's agricultural production next year. After this year's great leap forward and the unprecedented comprehensive agricultural harvest, the broad masses of peasants are eagerly demanding an even greater leap forward and harvest in agricultural production next year. The plan proposed by the two provinces to strive for 1,000 jin of wheat per mu embodies the wishes and demands of the broad masses. This plan will further mobilize the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses and will surely create new miracles of large-area high yields on the agricultural production front. We hope that the comrades in Hebei and Henan provinces will continue to promote the communist spirit, go all out, and take effective measures to act now to ensure the realization and overfulfillment of this plan. We also hope that other provinces, like Hebei and Henan, will strive to become provinces with 1,000 jin of wheat per mu.
    On the basis of the great leap forward in agriculture in 1958, and after a large number of high-yield "satellites" were launched in various places, it is now very necessary to put forward the fighting slogan of 1,000-jin provinces and make the effort to achieve large-area high yields the central task on China's agricultural production front in 1959.
    Large-area high yield is the fundamental sign of a country's agricultural production level. In China, striving for large-area high yield is of particular importance. China is a large country with 650 million people. The well-being of 650 million people depends on large-area high yield in agriculture; the realization of industrialization also depends on large-area high yield in agriculture; and the development of other socialist construction undertakings also requires large-area high yield in agriculture. Although China's grain production has jumped to an average of about 1,000 jin per person this year, it is still not very abundant, and other crops such as cotton and oil crops are still far from meeting the needs of the people. Therefore, next year's agricultural production must have a greater leap forward than this year, and we must strive for a comprehensive and larger-area harvest. Can we make agriculture have a greater leap forward next year? Can we achieve large-area high yield? The answer is yes. The great leap forward and great harvest in agriculture in 1958 provide us with a sufficient basis. This year, a large number of high-yield fields have appeared throughout the country, and many high-yield "satellites" have been launched. The emergence of these high-yield fields and "satellites" has not only completely liberated people's minds, making them dare to create greater miracles, but also enriched people's practical farming experience in striving for high yields. As long as we can sum up these experiences well and promote them, so that a wider range of areas and more people can master these experiences and apply them to future farming, we will certainly be able to make agricultural production leap forward even more next year, and we will certainly be able to win the victory of large-area high yield.
    This year, there is a very prominent feature in the leadership of agricultural production in various places: they all attach great importance to cultivating high-yield fields and high-yield "satellites". This approach has played a great role in enriching leadership experience, establishing advanced banners, and promoting the rapid development of the entire agricultural production. This must be affirmed. However, some places have not paid enough attention to striving for large-area high yield when they are vigorously engaged in high-yield fields and high-yield "satellites". It should be known that we are not engaged in experimental fields for the sake of experimental fields, or "satellites" for the sake of "satellites". We are launching "satellites" to promote and strive for large-area high yield, and to "break through at one point, absorb experience, and promote the overall situation". This working method of breaking through at one point to promote the overall situation is the working method of "combining the general with the individual" and "combining improvement with popularization" that Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us. Cultivating small high-yield fields and high-yield "satellites" is the work of improvement; using the experience of high-yield fields and high-yield "satellites" to strive for large-area high yield is the work of popularization. Improvement and popularization cannot be separated at all. It is wrong to engage in "satellites" in isolation. Once "satellites" are separated from large-area high yield, they lose their meaning. Similarly, in striving for large-area high yield, we must never neglect the cultivation of "satellites", because high-yield "satellites" can promote large-area high yield. This repeated process of popularization under the guidance of improvement, and improvement on the basis of popularization, can enable our agricultural production to develop forward with leap after leap.
    The fact is exactly like this. Last year, only a few mu of wheat and rice yielded 1,000 jin per mu. This year, with a great leap forward, various places promoted the experience of 1,000-jin mu from last year on a large scale, and more than one million mu of wheat yielding 1,000 jin per mu appeared, including many high-yield "satellites" of 2,000 jin, 3,000 jin, and even more than 8,000 jin. The peasants in various places also promoted the experience of this year's high-yield wheat "satellites" to early rice and other crops, which resulted in a great increase in the yield of early rice and other crops. Not only did many high-yield "satellites" of 1,000 jin, 10,000 jin, and tens of thousands of jin appear, but also four early rice provinces of 1,000 jin appeared in Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Henan, as well as a large number of 1,000-jin counties and 1,000-jin special districts including various crops. Since we have already created large-area high yields in many places this year, why can't we obtain larger-area high yields next year through our efforts?
    This year's great leap forward and great harvest in China's agriculture provide a solid material basis for a greater leap forward in agriculture next year. This is a very favorable condition for us to strive for large-area high yield next year. Water, fertilizer, and soil are extremely important conditions for obtaining a great agricultural harvest. Last year, when we entered the great leap forward in agriculture, these conditions were very poor. After a year of efforts by the broad masses of peasants, the situation is completely different. Large-scale water conservancy construction has expanded China's irrigated area to more than half of the total cultivated land. After the efforts of this winter and next spring, most parts of the country can basically realize water conservancy, and the ability to resist drought and flood will be greatly improved. The biggest natural disasters in agricultural production are drought and flood. Once we conquer these two major disasters, we can create a relatively stable and good natural environment for China's agricultural production, and we can make China's agricultural production leap forward more guaranteed. The fertilizer problem is also the same. Due to the large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement in various places and the great development of indigenous chemical fertilizer industry, China's fertilizer situation has been greatly improved. As for the "soil" problem, various places have many good experiences in deep plowing and soil improvement this year, and various places are now engaged in a large-scale deep plowing movement. With water, fertilizer, and deep plowing, our land will become more fertile. If it is said that striving for a greater leap forward in agriculture mainly depends on the two factors of "people and things", especially on the human factor, then the situation of people is now many times better than a year ago! Through rectification and socialist education, the peasants' political consciousness is getting higher and higher, and their enthusiasm for building socialism is also getting higher and higher. This is the first point. Second, the great harvest has brought people a better and richer happy life. The broad masses of peasants are eating better and dressing better, so their labor enthusiasm is higher and their energy is more sufficient. Everything depends on human effort. With such high political consciousness and such sufficient energy among the people, what miracles cannot be created!
    Third, the people's commune movement is now entering a climax in various places. Many areas have already been communized, and the national communization will be completed in the near future. The people's commune is the most important and unprecedentedly favorable condition for us to strive for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year. The people's commune is large in scale and has strong economic strength. In the people's commune, agriculture, forestry, sideline occupations, animal husbandry, and fishery are comprehensively developed, and industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs are unifiedly led. It has greater superiority than the smaller agricultural cooperatives. Things that agricultural cooperatives could not do in the past can now be done by the people's commune; things that agricultural cooperatives could not do in the past can now be done by the people's commune. We should use the high tide of the people's commune to promote the high tide of production, and we should give full play to the superiority of the people's commune, so that it can become a material force for promoting work and striving for large-area high yield next year.
    Of course, this does not mean that we will not encounter any difficulties in the struggle to strive for a greater leap forward in agriculture next year. There will still be difficulties. For example, the right-leaning conservative thinking has not been completely eliminated among some cadres and masses, and the "wait-and-see" faction has not completely disappeared; for example, the leadership in some areas has not timely shifted the focus of leadership production to striving for large-area high yield, so the organizational, ideological, and material preparations are not enough; for example, with the comprehensive leap forward in rural work, especially after running industries on a large scale, labor is felt to be insufficient, and so on. But as long as we strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and fully mobilize the masses, any difficulties can be overcome. Taking the shortage of manpower as an example, many places have adopted the method of militarizing labor organization, combatizing actions, and collectivizing production, implementing communist large-scale cooperation, vigorously carrying out tool reforms, and improving labor efficiency, and the problem of manpower shortage has been readily solved.
    Striving for large-area high yield of wheat is the first battle in striving for a comprehensive and greater leap forward in agricultural production next year. Successfully completing the wheat sowing task and sowing all the wheat on deeply ploughed and fertile land is the primary key to striving for a great wheat harvest. Now the wheat sowing season has arrived, and the struggle to strive for a greater leap forward in agriculture next year, first of all, the struggle to strive for large-area high yield of wheat, has already begun. We hope that all localities will immediately strengthen their leadership and be sure to lay the foundation for a bumper harvest at the time of sowing, and win the first battle in the great leap forward this winter and next spring.

    争取大面积高产
    河北、河南两省力争明年实现小麦千斤省。这是一个振奋人心的消息，是我国明年农业生产更大跃进的先声。经过今年的大跃进，获得了农业全面的空前大丰收以后，广大农民迫切要求明年农业生产要有一个更大的跃进，更大的丰收。两省提出的力争小麦千斤省的计划，集中地体现了广大群众的愿望和要求。这一计划必将进一步动员起广大群众的积极性和热情，必将在农业生产战线上创造出新的大面积丰收的奇迹。我们希望河北、河南两省的同志们继续发扬共产主义风格，鼓足干劲，采取有效措施，从现在起就行动起来保证实现和超额完成这个计划。我们也希望其他各省像河北、河南两省一样，争取成为小麦千斤省。
    在1958年农业大跃进的基础上，在各地大量放出单位面积高产“卫星”以后，提出千斤省的战斗口号，把争取大面积高产作为1959年我国农业生产战线上的中心任务，已经是十分必要的了。
    大面积高产是衡量一个国家农业生产水平的根本标志。在我国，争取大面积高产尤其具有特殊重要的意义。我国是一个拥有六亿五千万人民的大国。六亿五千万人民的丰衣足食，依靠农业大面积高产；实现工业化，也依靠农业的大面积高产；发展其他各项社会主义建设事业，也需要农业大面积高产。今年我国粮食生产虽然已跃进到全国平均每人有一千斤左右的水平，但仍然不是很富裕的，而其他农作物如棉花、油料作物等还距离人民的需要很远。因此，明年的农业生产，必须有一个比今年更大的跃进，必须争取全面的更大面积的丰收。我们能不能使农业明年有个更大的跃进呢？能不能实现大面积高产呢？回答是肯定的。1958年的农业大跃进大丰收，给我们提供了充分的根据。今年，全国各地出现了大量的高额丰产田，放出了许多的高产“卫星”。这些丰产田和高产“卫星”的出现，不仅彻底解放了人们的思想，使人们敢于去创造更大的奇迹；也丰富了人们争取高额产量的实际耕作经验。只要我们把这些经验很好地总结起来推广出去，使更广大的地区更多的群众掌握了这些经验，并把它运用到今后的耕作中去，我们就一定能够使明年农业生产来一个更大跃进，就一定能够夺得大面积高产的胜利。
    今年各地在领导农业生产中有一个非常突出的特点：都十分重视培育高额丰产田和高产“卫星”。这种作法对于丰富领导经验，树立先进旗帜，推动整个农业生产迅速发展，起了很大作用。这是必须肯定的。但是有些地方在大搞丰产田、高产“卫星”的时候，对争取大面积高产就注意不够。应该知道，我们不是为搞试验田而搞试验田，为搞“卫星”而搞“卫星”。我们搞“卫星”是为了推动和争取大面积高产，是为了“突破一点，吸取经验，推动全面”。这种突破一点推动全面的工作方法，就是毛泽东同志经常教导我们的“一般和个别相结合”、“提高和普及相结合”的工作方法。培育小块的高额丰产田和高产“卫星”，是提高的工作；用丰产田和高产“卫星”的经验去争取大面积高产，是普及的工作。提高和普及一点也不能分离。孤立地搞“卫星”是不对的。“卫星”一旦脱离了大面积丰产就失掉了意义。同样，争取大面积高产，也绝不可忽视对“卫星”的培育，因为高产“卫星”可以推动大面积丰产。这种提高指导下的普及，普及基础上的提高的反复进行，就能够使我们的农业生产跃进再跃进地向前发展。
    事实也正是这样的。去年，我国只出现了少数几亩小麦、水稻的千斤亩，今年一个大跃进，各地把去年千斤亩的经验在很大范围内推广开来，便出现了一百多万亩小麦千斤亩，其中还有很多二千斤、三千斤以至八千多斤的高产“卫星”。各地农民又把今年的小麦高产“卫星”的经验，推广到早稻和其他作物，结果又使早稻和其他作物的产量极大提高起来，不仅出现了很多千斤、万斤、几万斤的高产“卫星”，还出现了安徽、江苏、湖北、河南四个早稻千斤省，也出现了大批的包括各种作物的千斤县、千斤专区。既然今年我们已经在很多地方创造了大面积丰产，经过努力为什么不能使明年获得更大面积的高额丰产呢？
    今年我国的农业的大跃进大丰收，为明年的农业更大跃进提供了雄厚的物质基础，这是我们争取明年大面积高产十分有利的条件。水、肥、土是取得农业大丰收的极重要条件。去年我们进入农业大跃进的时候，这些条件都是很差的。经过一年来广大农民的努力，情况已经完全不同了。大修水利使我国的灌溉面积已经扩大到全部耕地一半以上，再经过今冬明春的努力，全国绝大部分地区就可基本上实现水利化，抗旱抗涝的能力就会有更大的提高。农业生产上最大的自然灾害莫过于旱灾和涝灾。这两大灾害一旦被我们征服，就能为我国农业生产创造比较稳定的良好的自然环境，就能使我国的农业生产更有保证地向前跃进。肥料问题也是一样，由于各地大搞积肥运动，由于土制化学肥料工业的大发展，我国的肥料状况已经有了极大的改善。至于“土”的问题，今年各地都有许多深耕和改良土壤的好经验，现在各地正在大搞深耕运动。有水有肥再加上深耕，就会使我们的土地更加肥沃起来。如果说争取农业更大跃进主要依靠“人和物”两方面的因素，尤其依靠人的因素，那么人的状况比物的状况现在比一年以前不知好了多少倍！整风和社会主义教育，农民的政治觉悟愈来愈高了，建设社会主义的积极性也越来越高了，这是一；第二，大丰收给人民带来了更美好更富裕的幸福生活。广大农民吃得更好些了，穿得更好些了，因此劳动热情更高，干劲也更足了。事在人为，人民群众政治觉悟这样高，干劲这样足，还有什么奇迹创造不出来呢！
    第三，目前各地人民公社运动正进入高潮。有很多地区已经公社化了，全国公社化也将在最近期间完成。人民公社化是我们争取明年农业生产更大跃进的最重要的，也是从来没有过的有利条件。人民公社规模大，经济力量雄厚。人民公社里农、林、副、牧、渔全面发展，工农商学兵统一领导。它比规模小的农业社具有更大的优越性。过去农业社不能办的事情，现在人民公社能办了；过去农业社办不到的事情，现在人民公社也能办到了。我们应该用人民公社化的高潮推动起生产的高潮，应该充分发挥人民公社的优越性，使它成为推动工作争取明年大面积高产的物质力量。
    当然，这并不是说在争取明年农业更大跃进的斗争中，再不会遇到什么困难了。困难仍然会有的。比如在一部分干部和群众中右倾保守思想还没有最后肃清，观潮派还没有最后绝迹；比如有些地区领导上还没有及时地把领导生产的着眼点转到争取大面积高产方面来，因而组织的、思想的以及物质的准备工作做得不够；比如农村工作的全面跃进，特别是大办工业之后，劳动力都感到不足，等等，都是困难。但只要加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，任何困难都是可以克服的。拿人力不足来说，很多地方采取了劳动组织军事化、行动战斗化、生产集体化的办法，实行共产主义大协作，大搞工具改革，提高劳动效率，人力不足的问题就迎刃而解了。
    争取小麦大面积高产是争取明年农业生产全面的更大跃进的第一个战役。胜利完成小麦播种任务，把全部小麦都播种在深耕肥足的土地上，又是争取小麦大丰收的首要关键。现在小麦的播种季节已经到了，争取明年农业更大跃进，首先是争取小麦大面积高产的斗争已经开始了。我们希望各地立即加强领导，一定要在播种的时候就把丰收的基础打好，在今冬明春的大跃进中旗开得胜。
