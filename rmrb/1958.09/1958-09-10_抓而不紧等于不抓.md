　　Grasping without Tightening Equals Not Grasping
　　Wu Lü
　　Let me tell a story about an indigenous blast furnace first.
　　According to the instructions of the County Party Committee, the Yinyanggou Iron Plant in Bishan County, Sichuan Province, built an indigenous blast furnace. After more than two days of trials, they didn't produce a single bit of iron, and many people became discouraged. The County Party Secretary discovered this situation and immediately analyzed the reasons with everyone, encouraging them to continue working hard. As a result, the plant built another indigenous blast furnace, but this time it still didn't produce iron, and many people became discouraged again. When the County Party Secretary heard the news, he rushed over again to find the reasons with everyone and boost morale. After several repetitions, the indigenous blast furnace of the Yinyanggou Iron Plant finally produced iron.
　　This incident illustrates a problem: When it comes to work, if you grasp, you must grasp tightly; grasping without tightening equals not grasping.
　　Grasping is better than not grasping, which is obvious. Why does grasping without tightening equal not grasping? We know that in the development process of any thing, there exists a contradictory movement from beginning to end. When old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions arise; and in the development process of any relatively complex thing, there also exist many contradictions, among which there are major and minor ones. The major contradictions affect the minor contradictions, but the minor contradictions are still an objective reality and must not be ignored. To do our work well, we must grasp it tightly. The so-called grasping means grasping tightly has two aspects. One is to carry it through to the end, to the very end. After resolving the old contradictions, we must pay attention to the new contradictions, without relaxing for a moment. The other is to have a broad vision, to grasp thoroughly. After solving the problem in this area, we must pay attention to the problem in that area, without relaxing any link. If we grasp without tightening, for example, starting strong but finishing weak, sometimes hot and sometimes cold, or grasping this end and losing that end, we will inevitably fail in the end. Take the failure to produce iron in the indigenous blast furnace as an example! There are ideological problems and technical problems; after solving the technical problems in construction, we must also solve the technical problems in operation. If the Secretary of the Bishan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did not grasp the indigenous blast furnace of the Yinyanggou Iron Plant so tightly, grasping ideological work and technical work in every way, and trying again and again if it didn't work the first time; but instead grasped this aspect and lost that aspect, having the first time but not the second time, then the indigenous blast furnace of the Yinyanggou Iron Plant would still not produce iron. Although it was grasped, but no iron was produced, isn't this grasping without tightening the same as not grasping?
　　Grasping without tightening equals not grasping; moreover, grasping without tightening has an extra layer of camouflage compared to not grasping. If a task is not grasped, sometimes one will feel guilty, "always having something on one's mind," unable to sleep. If a task is grasped a little, a meeting is held, and a mobilization report is made, it can also make people feel at ease. Aren't some of our comrades like this? They also grasp steel, and also go to the site, but they are just skimming the surface, glancing over it, and then they relax afterwards, as if the problems have already been solved. To get these comrades to grasp the work tightly, one is to solve the problem of leadership style, and the other is to solve the problem of thinking methods. Grasping without tightening is often not just a problem of leadership style, but also a problem of thinking methods: lacking a deep understanding of the development of objective things, knowing only one thing and not knowing the other, so that things are simplified.
　　Grasping steel, this is what everyone has already paid attention to. What needs to be reminded now is that if you want to grasp, you must grasp tightly, and only by grasping tightly can you grasp 10.7 million tons of steel.

### 抓而不紧等于不抓

　　抓而不紧等于不抓
　　吴滤
    先讲一座土高炉的故事。
    四川省壁山县阴阳沟铁厂根据县委的指示建了一座土高炉，经过两天多的试验，没有炼出一点铁来，许多人泄了气。县委书记发现了这个情况，马上同大家分析原因，鼓励大家继续再干。于是，厂里又修了一座土高炉，但这次还是不出铁，许多人又泄气了。县委书记听到消息，又赶忙跑来同大家找原因，鼓干劲。如此反复了几次，阴阳沟铁厂的土高炉终于出铁了。
    这件事说明一个问题：工作，要抓就要抓紧；抓而不紧，等于不抓。
    抓比不抓好，这是显而易见的。为什么抓而不紧，等于不抓呢？我们知道，任何事物的发展过程中，都存在着自始至终的矛盾运动，旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又产生了；而且任何比较复杂的事物的发展过程中，还存在着许多矛盾，其中虽然有主要的，也有次要的，主要的矛盾影响着次要的矛盾，但次要的矛盾总还是一个客观存在，决不能熟视无睹。我们要把工作做好，就要把工作抓紧。所谓要抓就要抓紧，有两方面的意思。一是要贯彻始终，抓到底，解决了旧的矛盾，还要注意新的矛盾，一刻也不放松。一是要目光四射，抓得透，解决了这方面的问题，还要注意那方面的问题，一环也不放松。若是抓而不紧，例如虎头蛇尾，时冷时热，或者抓了这头，丢了那头，总不免功亏一篑。就拿土高炉不出铁这件事情来说吧！有思想问题，也有技术问题；解决了建造中的技术问题，还要解决操作中的技术问题。如果中共壁山县委书记抓阴阳沟铁厂的土高炉不是抓得那么紧，思想工作、技术工作样样抓，一回不成再来二回；而是抓了这一面，丢了那一面，有了第一回，没有第二回，那么，阴阳沟铁厂的土高炉还是不会出铁的。虽然抓了，但不出铁，这抓而不紧，不是等于不抓吗？
    抓而不紧，等于不抓；而且抓而不紧同不抓比起来，还多了一层保护色。一件工作没有抓，有时还会感到内疚，“心里总有一件事”，睡不着觉。一件工作抓了一下，开过一次会，做过一次动员报告，却也能使人心安理得。我们有些同志不就是这样的吗？他们也抓钢铁，也到现场，但都只是蜻蜓点水，一掠而过，回来之后也就松下劲来，好像问题都已经解决了。要这些同志把工作抓紧，一是要解决领导作风的问题，二是要解决思想方法的问题。抓而不紧，常常不只是领导作风的问题，也是思想方法的问题：对于客观事物的发展缺乏深刻的认识，只知其一不知其二，以致把事情简单化了。
    抓钢铁，这是大家都已注意了的。现在要提醒的是，要抓就要抓紧，只有抓紧才能抓到一千零七十万吨钢。
