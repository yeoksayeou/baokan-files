　　Marxist-Leninist Theory Textbook
    Highlights of the First Issue of "World Marxist Review"

    Foreword

    The foreword points out that this magazine is a joint publication of the Central Committees of the Communist and Workers' Parties that participated in the meeting of several Communist Parties held in Prague in March this year. It is an international forum for fraternal parties to exchange opinions and experiences.

    Events of worldwide historical significance are taking place on our planet: the transition from capitalism to socialism is being realized worldwide. The fact that socialism has become a world system has changed the course of modern history and opened a new era in human life. Practical life proves that only socialism can bring true freedom and prosperity to the people of all countries. No matter how hard bourgeois thinkers and their revisionist echoes try to whitewash imperialism, the economic and political instability of the capitalist system is becoming increasingly clear. The working class has proven in practice that only it can solve the various problems that the times have posed to mankind. The international communist movement has truly become the wisdom, glory, and conscience of our time. These historical changes have raised new questions for Marxist-Leninist thought, and the publication of this journal is intended to assist in elucidating and studying these questions.

    The basic task of this magazine is to promote and further explore Marxist-Leninist theory. It will promote and expound the ideas of the programmatic document, the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries, to further strengthen the ideological unity and solidarity of the communist ranks. Its primary responsibility is to oppose all forms of bourgeois ideology, and first and foremost, to oppose revisionism—the main danger in the communist movement under modern conditions. At the same time, it will also adopt an irreconcilable attitude towards dogmatism and sectarianism.

    The issue of striving for peace and friendship between the people of all countries in the world will occupy a special place in this journal. Its mission is to strengthen the unity of all peace-loving democratic forces, to develop contacts and cooperation between Communist and Socialist parties, to promote the principles of proletarian internationalism, and the principles of friendly cooperation between the people of all countries.

    Struggle for Peace and the Victory of Socialism

    An. Novotny

    The article points out that the name of the new publication of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "World Marxist Review," reflects the two basic issues currently facing all of mankind. At present, the process of transition from capitalism to socialism has developed to such an extent worldwide that we can say that the strength of the new social system has surpassed the strength of the dying capitalist world. The socialist camp has a decisive influence on the politics of the entire world. This primarily determines the gratifying situation that war is no longer inevitably inevitable and that war can be prevented.

    The article then analyzes the relationship between peace and socialism, and the fundamental difference in principle between Marxists and pacifists on the issue of war and peace.

    The article says that at present, the forces of peace are able to restrain any aggressor, but the strength and evil of imperialism should not be underestimated. The Czechoslovak Communist Party, together with other fraternal parties headed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, will do everything possible to smash the various war conspiracies of imperialism and its running dogs against peace and socialism, and to make the working people of the whole world understand that socialism means peace, and that the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism, as long as they unite and act in unison, will definitely be able to prevent the disaster of war.

    Basic Problems of China's Socialist Construction at the Present Stage

    Li Fuchun

    The article points out that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, after eight years of hard struggle, the Chinese people have now achieved a comprehensive and decisive victory in the socialist revolution, and have also achieved significant victories in socialist construction. The Chinese Communist Party's general line for building socialism, its call for carrying out technological and cultural revolutions, has already had a huge impact on the masses of people throughout the country and has become a great material force. There is no doubt that this force will promote the faster development of our country's socialist cause. The article expounds the basic problems of the general line for socialist construction, technological and cultural revolutions, the Chinese Communist Party's basic method of carrying out socialist construction work—the mass line, improving state work, strengthening the Party's leadership over construction work, and political and ideological work.

    Socialism and the State

    G. Glezerman, B. Ukraintsev

    This article expounds the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state and refutes the reactionary theory of the state of the Yugoslav revisionists.

    The Fascist Threat in France and United Action to Defend the Republic

    J. Duclos

    The article says that the colonial policy pursued by the ruling groups of the French bourgeoisie in recent years has caused a political crisis. The bourgeois authorities have brought out de Gaulle, who was originally a reserve, not to show that they are powerful, but on the contrary, to show that they are weak, and to show that the bourgeoisie can no longer rule in an ordinary democratic way.

    The article emphasizes that the French workers and all democrats must unite and quickly counter every attack by the reactionary forces. They must unite and crush all attempts to organize fascist movements and defend democratic freedoms.

    Symposium

    This column contains excerpts from speeches at a symposium on the issue of "Economic Crisis and the Working Class" organized by the editorial department of the magazine on June 23. Participating in the symposium and expressing their opinions were members of the delegations of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries attending the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

    Communist and Workers' Parties

    This column reports on the dynamics of various aspects of the work and activities of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries.

    This magazine also has two columns, "Book Reviews" and "Letters to the Editor."

### 马克思列宁主义理论的教材  “和平和社会主义问题”杂志第一期提要

1958-09-01
第5版()
专栏：

　　马克思列宁主义理论的教材
    “和平和社会主义问题”杂志第一期提要
    发刊词
    发刊词指出：这个杂志是参加今年3月在布拉格举行的几国共产党代表会议的共产党和工人党中央委员会的共同刊物。它是兄弟党之间交换意见和经验的国际论坛。
    在我们的星球上发生着具有全世界历史意义的事件：从资本主义向社会主义的过渡正在世界范围内实现。社会主义变成世界体系这一事实，改变了现代历史的潮流，在人类生活中揭开了一个新的时代。实际生活证明，只有社会主义能够给各国人民带来真正的自由和繁荣。无论资产阶级的思想家和他们的修正主义应声虫怎样费尽心思地来粉饰帝国主义，资本主义体系在经济上和政治上的不稳定是越来越清楚了。工人阶级已经在实践上证明，只有它能够解决时代在人类面前所提出的各种问题。国际共产主义运动已真正成为我们时代的智慧、光荣和良心。这些历史变化在马克思列宁主义思想面前提出了新的问题，本刊的出版，就是为了协助阐述和研究这些问题。
    这个杂志的基本任务是宣传和进一步探讨马克思列宁主义理论。它将宣传和阐发社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言这个纲领性文件的思想，以此进一步加强共产主义队伍的思想统一和团结一致。它的首要职责是反对形形色色的资产阶级思想，首先是反对修正主义——现代条件下共产主义运动中的主要危险。同时，它对教条主义和宗派主义也将采取不调和的态度。
    争取和平和世界各国人民之间的友好的问题，将在本刊占特别地位。它的使命就在于加强一切爱好和平的民主的力量的团结，发展共产党和社会党之间的接触和合作，宣传无产阶级国际主义原则，以及各国人民友好合作的原则。
    为和平和社会主义的胜利而斗争
    安·诺沃提尼
    文章指出，共产党和工人党的新刊物“和平和社会主义问题”这个名称反映了当前整个人类所面临的两个基本问题。目前，由资本主义向社会主义过渡的过程在世界范围内发展到了这样的程度，以致我们可以说，新的社会制度的力量已经胜过垂死的资本主义世界的力量了。社会主义阵营对整个世界的政治起着决定的影响。这一点首先决定了这样一种可喜的局势，而战争不再是注定不可避免的，战争是可以防止的。
    文章接着分析了和平和社会主义的相互关系，马克思主义者和和平主义者在战争与和平问题上的原则区别。
    文章说，目前和平力量能够制止任何侵略者，但是也不能对帝国主义的力量和罪恶估计过低。捷克斯洛伐克共产党和以苏联共产党为首的其他兄弟党一起，将尽一切努力，来粉碎帝国主义及其走狗反对和平和社会主义的各种战争阴谋，使全世界劳动人民了解到：社会主义就意味着和平，和平、民主和社会主义的力量只要联合起来一致行动，就一定能够防止战争灾难。
    中国社会主义建设现阶段的基本问题
    李富春
    文章指出，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，经过八年的努力奋斗，现在已经获得了社会主义革命的全面的决定性的胜利，同时也获得了社会主义建设的重大胜利。中国共产党关于建设社会主义的总路线，关于开展技术革命和文化革命的号召，已经在全国人民群众中产生了巨大的影响，成为伟大的物质力量。毫无疑问，这个力量将推动我国社会主义事业更加迅速的发展。文章阐述了社会主义建设总路线、技术革命和文化革命、中国共产党进行社会主义建设工作的基本方法——群众路线、改进国家工作、加强党对建设的领导工作以及政治和思想工作等基本问题。
    社会主义和国家
    格·格列则尔曼、勃·乌克拉英采夫
    这篇文章阐述了马克思列宁主义的国家学说，驳斥了南斯拉夫修正主义者的反动的国家论。
    法国的法西斯威胁和捍卫共和国的一致行动
    雅·杜克洛
    文章说，法国资产阶级统治集团近年来执行的殖民政策引起了政治危机，资产阶级当权人物把原来作为后备的戴高乐抬出来，并不是表明他们力量强大，相反却是表明他们软弱，表明资产阶级已经不能用普通的民主方式进行统治了。
    文章强调说，法国劳动者和全体民主分子必须团结起来，迅速回击反动势力的每一次袭击，必须团结一致，粉碎一切组织法西斯运动的企图，捍卫民主自由。
    座谈会
    这一栏中刊载了杂志编辑部6月23日组织的一次讨论“经济危机和工人阶级”问题的座谈会上的发言摘要。参加这次座谈会并发表意见的是出席捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会的各国共产党和工人党代表团团员们。
    共产党和工人党
    这一栏中报道了各国共产党和工人党的各方面工作和活动的动态。
    这个杂志还辟有“书刊评介”和“读者来信”两栏。
