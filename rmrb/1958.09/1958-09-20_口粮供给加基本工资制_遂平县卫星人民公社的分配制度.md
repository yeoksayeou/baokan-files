    Grain Ration Supply Plus Basic Wage System
    --Distribution System of the Satellite People's Commune in Suiping County
    Zhao Guang, Deputy Secretary of the Suiping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Henan Province
    The Satellite People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan Province, adopts a method of basic wages plus bonuses for distribution. The nature of this distribution method is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work."

    The distribution of grain rations is based on a supply system. For the wage portion: labor force is graded to determine wages, with 80% of the wage as basic wage, paid monthly, and 20% as bonus wage. Through a bottom-up evaluation method, bonus wages are issued monthly along with basic wages. This basic wage plus bonus wage system, after resolution by the commune members' representative assembly, has been formally implemented from September 1st.

    Grain Ration Supply System
    The distribution of grain rations is determined according to the national grain retention standards and the commune's increased production. The commune retains all members' grain collectively. Within the average per capita quota, the distribution method of fixed quantity per person is used to determine different consumption quantities for adults and children. Food ration cards are issued, and members obtain food at the commune's public canteen with the cards, supplied without charge. Members are responsible for the cost of vegetables (oil, salt, vegetables, etc.).

    Because grain is supplied through the supply system, the public canteen system within the commune is further consolidated. Therefore, some members voluntarily handed over their old grain to the commune through this grading process. A small number of well-to-do middle peasants still clung to the life of individual farming in the past, burying grain instead of handing it over, which was also reported through mutual exposure during the grading process. For example, well-to-do middle peasant Fu Maoting hid stolen grain on the hillside, which was handed over after exposure and criticism.

    Wage Standards
    To implement a basic wage plus bonus wage system, it is necessary to carefully calculate income and determine the consumption level of members. Under the condition of a large increase in production in the future, in order to meet the needs of expanded reproduction and gradually realize agricultural mechanization and electrification, an active policy should be adopted to expand public accumulation within the commune; at the same time, the needs of members' lives should also be taken into account in order to mobilize their enthusiasm for labor. In accordance with this spirit, the commune's income from agriculture, industry, and diversified economy should be carefully calculated. In calculating income, for the sake of accuracy, we calculated two accounts: The first account was calculated according to the income of the Great Leap Forward production plan, with an annual income of 22 million to 27 million yuan. This income is only used as a production goal and is not used as a basis for determining the wage system for the time being. The second account was calculated based on the principle of being reliable rather than high, to calculate the commune's various guaranteed incomes as the basis for determining wage standards. When determining the consumption of members, the principle of accumulating most of the increased production and reserving it, and using a small portion (generally controlled at about 15% of the increased production) to improve the lives of members, and implementing the spirit of using surplus to make up for deficiency, should be followed to appropriately determine the percentage of the total income that should be allocated to members (grain, wages, bonuses). Our calculation results are: the total annual income (including agriculture, industry, sideline occupations, forestry, animal husbandry, commerce, etc.) is more than 14 million yuan. Deductions (taxes, production costs, management fees, etc.) are more than 2.6 million yuan, accounting for 18.4% of the total income; accumulation (reserve grain, public accumulation, contingency funds, etc.) is more than 8.4 million yuan, accounting for 57.8% of the total income; distribution (grain rations, wages, bonuses) is more than 3.4 million yuan, accounting for 23.8% of the total income. As a result of this distribution, the average annual income per person is 80 yuan, exceeding the average of 36 yuan per member last year by 122.2%. In order to put the wage system on a more reliable basis, we also calculated a minimum number. That is, the total annual income is calculated according to more than 9.2 million yuan, the deduction part accounts for 18.6% of the total income; the accumulation part accounts for 54.5% of the total income; and the distribution part accounts for 26.9% of the total income. Based on this number, the average annual income of all commune members is 57.6 yuan (including grain rations), exceeding the income of members last year by 60%, and the average monthly wage income per labor force is more than 4 yuan. These two accounts were announced at the members' representative assembly at the same time, explaining that in order to put the wage system on a more reliable basis, the monthly wages of members before the autumn harvest will be paid according to the latter distribution account. If the total annual income reaches the income number of the former distribution account through the active efforts of all members, the wage amount that each labor force should receive according to the former account will be distributed, and the shortfall from the previous months of autumn will be made up.

    After this method was publicized and implemented among the members, the vast majority of members strongly supported and approved it. However, some people still held a skeptical attitude towards the implementation of the wage system, not believing that wages could be paid every month, and doubting where the commune would get the money to pay the wages. In addition, households with a strong labor force but few people believed that they would suffer losses by implementing the wage system. There were also a few people who believed that the implementation of the wage system was "egalitarianism," and that they would have food, clothing, and pocket money to spend even if they did not work in the future. Landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage. This situation shows that it is very important to strengthen political and ideological education in the implementation of the wage system. It is necessary to correct the members' understanding of the implementation of the wage system through political and ideological education, correctly understand the superiority of the people's commune, boost the enthusiasm of the members, and guide their enthusiasm for the implementation of the wage system to develop the commune's industrial and agricultural production in a faster, better, and more economical way, and consolidate the people's commune system. In this regard, we have done a lot of hard work to make everyone have a correct understanding and understanding of the implementation of the wage system, laying a favorable foundation for the next step of assessing labor force grades.

    Wage Levels
    Labor force ranking and evaluation of grades is the key to doing a good job in the wage system. In carrying out this work, the policy of equal pay for equal work for men and women should be implemented. The main conditions for evaluating labor force grades are: ideological awareness, labor attitude, production technology, and labor force strength. In terms of specific methods: First, the labor force should be ranked internally, that is, the team committee of each production team should rank labor forces of various levels based on the evaluation conditions, propose a preliminary list of labor forces of each level, and then let the members compare the conditions, freely express their opinions, and conduct debates to evaluate the wage levels of male and female members, and finally report to the commune for approval by the members' representative assembly. In order to prevent the phenomenon of fluctuating wages among various units, and to basically achieve a balance and rationality of wages between teams, we selected four units, namely the first, third, and thirteenth production brigades and the comprehensive factory, for key investigation and experimentation. After the investigation and experimentation, the labor force of the entire commune was divided into eight levels, and based on the difference in the average number of work points earned by each person per month in the past, we found out the proportion of each level of labor force: Level 1 labor force accounts for about 10% of the total labor force, Level 2 accounts for about 15%, Level 3 accounts for about 20%, Level 4 accounts for 20-25%, Level 5 accounts for 15-20%, Level 6 accounts for 10-15%, and Levels 7 and 8 together account for about 2%. This is used as the basis for each production team to evaluate the labor force of each level. On the basis of the evaluation by each production team, the production brigade will jointly evaluate the labor force of each production team, and finally the commune will conduct a joint evaluation by the brigade as a unit. After the basic evaluation is finalized, it will be announced person by person by the team. As a result of this approach, Level 1 labor force accounts for 8% of the total labor force, Level 2 accounts for 14.7%, Level 3 accounts for 21%, Level 4 accounts for 25%, Level 5 accounts for 18.2%, Level 6 accounts for 11.8%, Level 7 accounts for 1.1%, and Level 8 accounts for 0.2%. In order to avoid excessive income disparity among members, the wage level difference is also determined based on the actual work points earned by each level of labor force in peacetime. That is, the "point" is used as the algebraic number of the wage, Level 1 labor force is four points, Level 2 is five points, Level 3 is six and a half points, Level 4 is seven and a half points, Level 5 is nine points, Level 6 is ten points, Level 7 is twelve points, and Level 8 is fifteen points. According to this ratio, calculated according to the latter distribution account: the Level 8 labor force can get a monthly wage of 7.6 yuan per person, and the Level 1 labor force can get more than 2 yuan per month. If calculated according to the former distribution account: the Level 8 labor force can get a monthly wage of 13.7 yuan per person, and the Level 1 labor force can get 3.68 yuan.

    Regarding the wages of workers in various factories (fields). Since these workers were all transferred from the members of the various production brigades after the establishment of the commune, in the evaluation of their wages, the difference between their wages and the wages of the members engaged in agricultural production should not be too large. The specific situation of their technical capabilities should also be appropriately taken care of and given full play. Their wages will be evaluated by the original transferred production team to determine the labor force level, and then reviewed by the various factories (fields), and finally reported to the commune for approval by the members' representative assembly.

    Bonus Issues
    The bonus portion of the wage. In agriculture, the commune controls 50%, the brigade controls 30%, and the production team controls 20%. In industry and diversified economic production, the commune controls 60%, and the factory (field) controls 40%. In accordance with the principles of separate control by the commune, brigade, and production team, and by the commune and factory (field), separate rewards are given. The reward is mainly collective, but individual awards are also given. Reward method: collective awards (agricultural production is divided into wheat and autumn harvests, industrial production is quarterly), and the commune rewards and punishes according to the completion of production plans by various brigades and factories (fields). Individual awards: the production team and factory (field) reward and punish members mainly based on the completion of the production plan, with a small evaluation every ten days and a large evaluation every month. After evaluation, the bonus wage is issued at the same time as the wage. The number of people receiving bonus wages should generally account for 40-60% of the total number of members. If it is too small, a few people will get a lot of money, and if it is too wide, it will not play a role in rewards and punishments. Members who receive bonus wages should meet the following conditions: First, obey the leadership, listen to the command, and work actively; Second, actively participate in production, and complete or over-complete production tasks on time and with quality; Third, protect public property, and fight against bad people and bad deeds at any time and anywhere; Fourth, be ideologically progressive, strive to study technology, and be able to promote technological innovation, etc.; Fifth, work more than 28 days per month. Those who meet the above conditions, regardless of cadres or members, can receive bonus wages. Members who are not actively engaged in production, are passively lazy, and are absent from work without reason shall be given criticism and education or a deduction of basic wages according to the severity of the circumstances. If they fail to correct themselves for several consecutive months, they shall be reported to the brigade or commune for approval to reduce their wage level. When implementing the reward and punishment system, no matter what unit, when encountering irresistible disasters, although effective measures have been taken and active rescue has been carried out, if the loss of public property is still caused and the production plan is not completed, appropriate rewards should still be given. Conversely, those who cause serious production reduction due to irresponsibility and waste public property should be punished. In addition, different reward and punishment conditions should be formulated separately for kindergartens, nurseries, happiness homes, feeders, livestock farms, canteens, forestry, schools, clinics, supply and marketing outlets, etc.

    Several Specific Issues
    When implementing the basic wage plus bonus wage system, the following specific issues should be seriously dealt with.

    1. In bumper years, more reserves should be retained to make up for deficiencies in lean years. In years of special disasters when wages cannot be paid as usual, wage standards can be appropriately lowered. In years of average harvests, wages should be paid as usual.

    2. If working hours are extended due to production needs, no additional wages will be paid. If production cannot be carried out due to rainy or snowy seasons, wages will not be deducted.

    3. Those who take leave to return home and other off-commune personnel who participate in temporary production within the commune should be paid on a piecework basis, which will be borne by the commune. When the commune formulates a production plan each year, it should be included in the wage plan as a project, and allocated to each production unit to control the indicators. At the end of the month, the wages will be issued and reimbursed according to the actual expenses.

    4. The wages of workers with special skills, such as industrial technicians and agricultural machinery technicians, should be stipulated separately according to the principle of being slightly higher than the wages of ordinary commune members.

    5. Those who are injured on duty will be paid wages as usual during the recuperation period. Those who are disabled or die on duty should be given pensions by the commune.

    6. For the "five guarantees" households, they are divided into two types: full guarantee and half guarantee, according to their physical condition. Those with full guarantee will be fully supplied with living expenses by the commune; those with half guarantee should be assessed for their level and paid wages according to their physical labor situation.

    7. Those who cannot attend work due to illness will be paid wages as usual for up to three days with a doctor's certificate. After more than three days, wages will be deducted on a daily basis. After more than one month, wages will be suspended. If the suspension of wages causes financial difficulties, the commune will provide appropriate assistance from the public welfare fund. No matter what the reason, the deducted wages will be used uniformly by the production team together with the bonus wages.

    8. For maternity women, they will rest for one month before and after childbirth and receive half of their wages. Those with financial difficulties will be given appropriate assistance. Appropriate care will also be given in the distribution of agricultural work to ensure the health of women and children.

    9. For the families of those who enjoy the national salary system, they will pay a portion of the grain price to the commune appropriately, with reference to the past situation.

    Endless Benefits
    The implementation of this wage system has greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the vast majority of members, increased labor attendance, and improved production efficiency. In the past, 3,300 people in the entire commune had never participated in labor production. After the evaluation of wages, these people also began to go to the fields to engage in production. Due to the implementation of the wage system, not only has the labor attendance rate increased, but also the labor efficiency has been greatly improved. Those with low wage levels want to catch up with those with high wage levels, and those with high wage levels are more actively engaged in various productions.

    The difficulties of grain-deficient households have been solved. In the past, due to the financial difficulties of some households, they had to take out at least 25% of their labor force to engage in production to alleviate disaster. Now this part of the labor force can be fully invested in the industrial and agricultural production front.

    After the implementation of the wage system, members can receive their due wages every month, which solves the difficulty of members' usual pocket money.

    This wage system is not only reasonable, but also simple in method, especially reducing the trouble of evaluating work and recording points and simplifying financial procedures. In the past, the evaluation of work and recording points did delay a lot of labor time, and the work point recorders had to record work every day. Some people caused disunity among themselves because of the scoring. The financial procedures were also quite troublesome. In addition, in the past, there were two distributions a year, so members constantly borrowed money from the commune in peacetime. Therefore, not only did the financial staff feel troubled, but some accounts could not be cleared in a timely manner, which directly affected daily clearing and monthly closing. At the same time, it could also avoid the phenomenon of work point recorders embezzling work points and solve the phenomenon of unreasonable work point evaluation and recording.

    Through the evaluation of wages, mutual criticism and self-criticism were carried out, and the members further established a collective concept of loving the commune and protecting public property. The masses called it: "This wage evaluation is a political appraisal of the members." At the beginning of the wage evaluation, we proposed that the strength of labor, the level of technology, and the quality of labor attitude should be the conditions. The members put forward their opinions one after another: ideological awareness should be added and used as the first condition. Therefore, when the masses evaluated the labor force level, they carried out sharp criticism of those who did not love the commune, liked to steal things from the commune, and had serious capitalist ideas.

    Through the evaluation of wages, the undemocratic, non-laboring, and detached-from-the-masses phenomenon of some cadres has been reversed. Some team cadres were usually undemocratic and did not discuss things with the masses. This time, they were criticized during the evaluation. Some cadres said: They have not held a life meeting since the rectification of the commune. This time, they had a life meeting among the masses.

    口粮供给加基本工资制
    ——遂平县卫星人民公社的分配制度
    中共河南省遂平县委副书记　赵光
    河南遂平县卫星人民公社在分配上采取基本工资加奖励的办法。这种分配办法的性质是“各尽所能，按劳取酬”。
    口粮部分的分配，是实行供给制。工资部分是：劳动力分级确定工资，工资的80％作为基本工资，按月发给，20％作为奖励工资。通过自下而上的评比办法，每月随基本工资发放的同时发给奖励工资。这种基本工资加奖励的工资制，经过公社社员代表大会决议，已经从9月1日起，正式实行。
    口粮供给制
    口粮部分的分配，根据国家规定的留粮标准和本社的增产情况确定，由公社将所有社员的口粮统一留在社内，在不超过每人平均指标数内，按以人定量的分配办法确定大人、小孩等不同消费数量，发给食粮证，社员在公社的公共食堂内吃饭，粮食部分凭证取饭，无价供应。菜金（油、盐、菜等）社员自负。
    由于粮食实行供给制，就更加巩固了公社内的公共食堂制。因而有的社员通过这次评级自动将自己的陈粮交给社了，有少数富裕中农社员还在留恋过去单干时的生活，把粮食埋起来不交，经过评级别中的互相揭发也报出来了。例如富裕中农傅茂廷把偷的粮食放到山坡上，经过揭发批判也交出来了。
    工资标准
    实行基本工资加奖励的工资制度，必须认真的核算收入，确定社员的消费水平。在今后生产大量增加的条件下，为了满足扩大再生产的需要，逐步的实现农业机械化、电气化，应采取积极的方针，扩大社内的公共积累；同时也要照顾到社员生活上的需要，以调动社员劳动的积极性。根据这个精神，应该认真地核算社内的农业、工业、多种经济等项收入。在核算收入时，为了准确起见，我们算了两笔账：第一笔账，按照生产跃进计划收入算，全年可收入二千二百万元到二千七百万元。这个收入只作为生产上奋斗目标，暂不作为确定工资制的根据。第二笔账，按照宁低勿高十分可靠的原则，核算出全社的各种保证收入，作为确定工资标准的根据。在确定社员消费时，应首先根据增产部分绝大部分积累储备，少部分（一般控制在增产部分的15％左右）用于改善社员生活的原则，和贯彻以丰补歉的精神，恰当地确定社员分配部分（粮食、工资、奖励金）应占总收入部分的百分比。我们算账的结果是：全年总收入（包括农业、工业、副业、林业、牧畜、商业等）一千四百多万元。扣除部分（税金、生产费、管理费等）二百六十多万元，占总收入数的18.4％；积累部分（储备粮、公共积累、机动金等）八百四十多万元，占总收入的57.8％；分配部分（口粮、工资、奖金）三百四十多万元，占总收入的23.8％。这样分配的结果，平均每人全年收入八十元，超过去年社员平均数三十六元的122.2％。为了使工资制放在更可靠的基础上，我们又算了一个最低数的账。即全年总收入按照九百二十多万元计，扣除部分占总收入数的18.6％；积累部分占总收入数的54.5％；分配部分占总收入数的26.9％。以此数来分配，全公社社员，平均每人全年收入五十七元六角（包括粮食部分在内），超过社员去年收入60％，每个劳动力平均每月收入工资四元多。将这两笔账同时在社员代表大会上宣布，说明为了使工资制放在更可靠的基础上，在秋收前社员的每月工资按照后一笔分配账发工资，如果经过全体社员的积极努力，使全年总收入达到前一笔分配账的收入数，即按照前一笔账分配每个劳动力应得工资数额，再将秋前几个月的缺数补齐。
    这个办法，在社员中宣传贯彻后，广大社员非常拥护和赞成。但也有些人对实行工资制抱着半信半疑的态度，对于月月发工资不相信，怀疑公社往那里弄这些钱来发工资。另外，劳力强人口少的户，则认为实行工资制自己吃亏。也还有少数人认为实行工资制就是“大平均”，今后不干活也有吃有穿有零钱花。地主、富农则趁机造谣破坏。这种情况说明加强实行工资制中的政治思想教育工作是非常重要的。必须通过对广大社员的政治思想教育，端正社员对实行工资制的认识，正确认识人民公社的优越性，鼓舞广大社员的干劲，将社员对实行工资制的热情引向多快好省地来发展公社的工农业生产，巩固人民公社制度。在这方面我们做了一番艰苦的工作，使大家都对实行工资制有个正确的认识和了解，给下步评定劳力等级打下有利基础。
    工资级别
    劳动力站队，评定好级别，是搞好工资制的关键。在进行这一工作时，应贯彻男女同工同酬的政策。评定劳动力级别的主要条件是：思想觉悟、劳动态度、生产技术、劳力强弱等。具体作法上：首先内部进行劳动力站队，即由各生产队队委会根据评级条件，找有代表性的各级标准劳动力进行站队，提出各级劳动力的初步名单，然后让社员对照条件，大鸣大放、开展辩论，评定出男女社员的工资级别，最后报公社经社员代表大会批准执行。为了防止各单位之间工资忽高忽低的现象，使队与队之间工资基本上达到平衡、合理，我们选择了第一、第三、第十三个生产大队和综合工厂等四个单位，进行了重点调查和试验。经过调查和试验的结果，全公社劳力共分为八级，并根据各级劳动力以往每人每月平均所得工分数的差别比例，摸出了各级劳动力的所占比例情况是：一级劳力占劳力总数的10％左右，二级占15％左右，三级占20％左右，四级占20—25％，五级占15—20％，六级占10—15％，七级和八级合占2％左右。以此作为各个生产队评定各级劳动力的依据。在各个生产队评定的基础上，由各生产大队将各生产队的劳动力进行联评，最后以大队为单位交公社进行联评。评定基本定案后，以小队为单位，逐人张榜公布。这样作的结果，一级劳动力占劳动力总数的8％，二级占14.7％，三级占21％，四级占25％，五级占18.2％，六级占11.8％，七级占1.1％，八级占0.2％。为了避免社员收入悬殊过大，工资等级差别，也是根据各级劳动力平时劳动实得工分情况确定的。即以“分”为工资的代数，一级劳动力为四分，二级为五分，三级为六分半，四级为七分半，五级为九分，六级为十分，七级为十二分，八级为十五分。依此比例，按照后一个分配账来计算：八级的劳动力，每人每月可得工资七元六角，一级劳力每月可得二元多。如按前一个分配账来计算：八级的劳力每人每月得工资十三元七角，一级劳力得三元六角八分。
    关于各个厂（场）的工人工资。由于这些工人均系公社建立后，由各个生产大队的社员中抽调的，因此在对他们的工资评定上，不能使其与进行农业生产的社员工资差别过大，又要适当照顾和充分发挥他们的技术能力的具体情况，将他们的工资由原抽调生产队评定劳力等级，交各厂（场）再进行复评，最后报公社经社员代表大会批准执行。
    奖励问题
    工资中的奖励部分。在农业上，社掌握50％，大队掌握30％，生产队掌握20％。在工业和多种经济生产上，社掌握60％，厂（场）掌握40％。按照社、大队、生产队和社、厂（场）分别掌握的原则，进行分别奖励，奖励主要是集体，同时也发个人奖。奖励的办法：集体奖（农业生产分麦秋两次，工业生产按季度），公社根据各个大队和厂（场）完成生产计划情况分别进行奖惩。个人奖，生产队和厂（场）对社员的奖励与处罚，主要是根据平时对生产计划完成情况，十天一小评，一月一大评，经过评比，随工资发放的同时发给奖励工资。领取奖励工资的人数，一般要占社员总数的40—60％。过少了使少数人得到很多钱，过宽了起不到奖惩的作用。领取奖励工资的社员应该具备如下条件：一，服从领导，听从指挥，积极工作；二，积极参加生产，按时按质的完成或超额完成生产任务；三，爱护公共财产，并随时随地向坏人坏事作斗争；四，思想进步，努力钻研技术，并能推进技术改革等；五，每月出勤在二十八天以上。合乎上述条件者，不论干部和社员均可领取奖励工资。对于不积极生产，消极怠工和无故缺勤的社员，根据情节轻重分别给予批评教育和扣发基本工资的处分，如经连续数月不改者，应报大队或社批准降低工资级别。在执行奖惩制度时，不论任何单位，在遇到人力不可抗拒的灾害时，虽然采取了有力措施，进行了积极的抢救，仍造成公共财产的损失，未完成生产计划者，仍应给予适当奖励。反之，如因不负责任造成严重减产，使公共财产损失浪费者，应受到处分。另外，对于幼儿园、托儿所、幸福院、饲养员、畜牧场、食堂、林业、学校、诊疗所、供销门市部等，均应分别订出不同奖惩条件。
    几个具体问题
    在实行基本工资加奖励的工资制度时，对以下具体问题，要认真地进行处理。
    一、丰收年应多留储备，以丰补歉。特大灾害年无法照发工资时，可适当降低工资标准，平收年应照发工资。
    二、由于生产需要延长工时，不增发工资。雨雪季节无法从事生产时，不扣发工资。
    三、放假还乡和其它外社人员参加社内临时生产，应按件计酬开支，由社内负责。公社每年订出生产计划时，应作为一个项目列入工资计划之内，并分配给各生产单位，控制指标，月终领发工资时，按实际开支报销。
    四、有特殊技术的工人，如工业上的技术人员，农业上的机务技术人员的工资，应当根据稍高于一般社员工资的原则，另外规定。
    五、因公负伤者，在休养期间照发工资。因公残废和死亡者，应当受到社内的抚恤。
    六、五保户，根据体力情况分成全保和半保两种。全保者由社全部供给生活费用；半保者，应根据体力劳动情况，评定级别，发给工资。
    七、因病不能出勤者，经过医生证明三天以内照发工资，超过三天以外，按天扣发工资，超过一月者，停发工资，停发工资后引起生活困难者，社内从公益金中予以适当照顾。不论任何原因，所扣发的工资均由生产队统一和奖励工资一并使用。
    八、产妇，产前产后休息一个月，发一半工资，生活困难者，适当照顾。并在分配农活上进行适当照顾，以保证妇女儿童的健康。
    九、凡享受国家工薪制人员的家属吃粮，参照过去情况，适当的缴社一部分粮食价款。
    好处说不完
    这一工资制度的实现，大大地鼓舞了广大社员的生产积极性，增加劳动出勤率，提高了生产效率。过去全公社有三千三百人根本没有参加过劳动生产，经过评工资后，这些人也开始下地从事生产了。由于工资制的实行，不仅增加了劳动出勤率，而且劳动效率也大大提高了。工资级别低的要赶上工资级别高的，工资级别高的则更加积极地从事各项生产。
    解决了缺粮户的困难。过去由于有的户生活困难，每年至少要拿出25％左右的劳动力去搞生产救灾。现在这一部分劳动力可以完全投入工农业生产战线上去。
    实行工资制后，社员能够月月领到自己应得的工资，这样就解决了社员平时零花钱的困难。
    这种工资制度不仅合理，而且方法简单，特别是减少评工记分的麻烦和简化了财务手续。过去由于评工记分确实耽误许多劳动时间，记工员要每天记工，有的群众为评分而引起互相之间的不团结。在财务手续上也是相当的麻烦，加之过去是一年两次分配，所以平时社员不断向社里借款。因而，不仅财务人员感到麻烦，也确使有些账目不能得到及时的清理，直接影响到日清月结，同时也可以避免记工员贪污工分的现象发生，解决了工分评记不合理的现象。
    通过评工资，开展了互相批评和自我批评，社员们进一步地树立了爱社爱护公共财物的集体观念。群众称为：“这次评工资，是一次对社员政治鉴定”。在开始评工资时，我们提出应以劳力强弱，技术高低，劳动态度好坏为条件，社员们纷纷提出意见：要加上思想觉悟，并作为第一个条件。因此群众在评定劳动力等级时，对于平时不爱社，好偷社里东西的和有严重资本主义思想的人开展了尖锐的批评。
    经过评定工资，扭转了部分干部的不民主、不爱劳动的脱离群众的现象。有些队里的干部平时不民主，有事不和群众商量，这次评级也都进行了批评。有的干部说：整社以来没有开过生活会，这次在群众中过了个生活会。
