Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th. Our correspondent reports: North Korea's agricultural cooperativization has been successfully completed. Currently, over 98% of farm households have joined agricultural cooperatives, and the cultivated land area owned by agricultural cooperatives accounts for 99.1% of the total cultivated land area. Only a small number of farmers living scattered in the deep mountains have not yet joined. Responsible cadres of the North Korean Ministry of Agriculture said that cooperativization will be fully realized this year.

This great transformation was completed in the four or five years after the war. In the second half of 1953, the first batch of agricultural cooperatives was established in North Korea. 1955 and 1956 were periods of great development. Now, among the 13,336 agricultural production cooperatives in North Korea, only 54 are elementary cooperatives, and the rest are advanced cooperatives. These agricultural production cooperatives are already quite consolidated in terms of organization and economy.

The superiority of cooperativization is increasingly evident with the development and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. Last year, after cooperativization was realized in most areas, North Korea achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, producing a total of 3.2 million tons of grain, an increase of more than 400,000 tons compared to pre-war levels, basically solving the food problem that has historically existed in North Korea. At the time of the armistice, 30% of the poor peasants in North Korea had difficulties in making a living. Last year, member households received an average of more than 1,700 kilograms of grain and 13,000 North Korean won per household. The living standards of farmers throughout North Korea have generally reached the level of middle peasants.

Agricultural cooperatives are powerful when organized. After cooperativization, North Korean farmers doubled the irrigated area of paddy fields in North Korea, making 91% of the paddy fields safe from water damage. Last winter and this spring alone, agricultural cooperatives built 30,000 small and medium-sized irrigation projects themselves. In addition, they actively participated in drought resistance last year and this year, overcoming the rare drought and achieving a bumper harvest. The farmers said that this was unimaginable before the realization of cooperativization.

This year, all agricultural cooperatives transplanted seedlings cultivated by the "cold-bed seedling raising method" in 70% of the paddy fields. Cotton seedlings were planted in all cotton fields using the cotton nutrient pot transplanting method. These advanced technologies, which are highly technical and labor-intensive, are beyond the capacity of individual farmers to promote. Due to cooperativization, North Korea's grain output this year will reach 3.6 million to 3.7 million tons, close to the target for the last year of the first five-year plan - 1961. Cotton has also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest.

Cooperativization has gradually changed the face of the North Korean countryside. Many places that were known for their poverty in the past have now become paradise. A large plain including Mundok and Sukchon counties, which used to be saline-alkali land on the coast, has now been transformed into a granary producing rice. The agricultural cooperatives in Kaechon County, known for its poor mountains and bad waters, have achieved good results in developing diverse economies such as sericulture and beekeeping. The corn harvest in this county has also been bumper for years.

North Korean agricultural cooperatives not only have the power to expand production, but also have the economic strength to carry out construction. Before the start of the new school year this year, agricultural cooperatives in North Korea built 3,600 classrooms themselves. During the first five-year plan, agricultural cooperatives will also build 200,000 new-style houses.

    朝鲜农业合作化胜利完成
    已有百分之九十八以上农户参加农业社
    粮食问题已基本上解决
    农民生活达到中农水平
    新华社平壤15日电　本社记者报道：朝鲜的农业合作化已经胜利完成。目前参加农业社的农户达98％以上，农业社所有的耕地面积达总耕地面积的99.1％，只有分散住在深山中的少数农民还没有入社。朝鲜农业省的负责干部说，在今年内将全部实现合作化。
    这个伟大的变革是在战后四、五年内完成的。在1953年下半年，朝鲜北部成立了最初的一批农业社，1955年和1956年是大发展的时期，现在整个朝鲜北部的一万三千三百三十六个农业生产合作社中，只有五十四个初级社，其余的都是高级社。这些农业生产合作社在组织和经济方面都已经相当巩固。
    合作化的优越性随着农业社的发展和巩固，日益显示出来。去年在大部分地区实现合作化以后，朝鲜北部取得了空前大丰收，共生产了三百二十万吨粮食，比战前增加了四十多万吨，基本上解决了朝鲜北部历史上存在的粮食问题。刚停战时，朝鲜北部有30％生活困难的贫农，去年，入社农户平均每户分得了一千七百多公斤谷物和一万三千元朝币，整个朝鲜北部农民的生活水平大体上达到了中农的水平。
    农业合作社组织起来力量大。朝鲜农民在合作化后把朝鲜北部的水田灌溉面积翻了一番，使91％的水田成为水利安全田。仅在去冬今春各农业社自己就修了三万项中小型灌溉工程。另外，在去年和今年他们都积极参加抗旱，战胜了罕见的旱灾，取得了丰收。农民们说，这在实现合作化以前是不能想像的。
    各农业社今年在70％的水田里插上了“冷床育苗法”育出的秧苗。在所有棉田里都用棉花营养罎假植法种上了棉花。这些技术性强、费劳力很多的先进技术，单干农民是没有力量来推广的。由于合作化，今年朝鲜的粮食产量将达三百六十万至三百七十万吨，接近第一个五年计划最后一年——1961年的指标。棉花也取得了空前的大丰收。
    合作化逐渐改变了朝鲜北部农村的面貌。许多过去出名的穷苦的地方，现在已变成了乐园。包括文德、肃川等四个郡的一片大平原过去是海滨碱地，现在已改造成盛产水稻的粮仓。以穷山恶水闻名的价川郡的各农业社，在发展养蚕、养蜂等多种经济方面已经取得了良好的成绩，这个郡的玉蜀黍连年也得到了丰收。
    朝鲜的农业社不仅有力量扩大生产，而且也已有经济力量进行建设。在今年的新学年开始前，朝鲜北部各农业社就自己建设了三千六百多间教室，在第一个五年计划内各农业社还要建设二十万幢新式住宅。
