　　Methods Not Found in Textbooks
    One evening, a member of an agricultural cooperative came to the Sunhe Township Hospital in Beijing's Chaoyang District, suffering from severe upper abdominal pain. Some doctors thought it was gastroenteritis, but several graduating students from the Beijing Medical College's medical department, after repeated diagnoses, suspected pancreatitis.

    At school, they could immediately perform an "amylase" test using an incubator and soluble starch to make a definite judgment. However, they were now in the countryside, with neither an incubator nor readily available soluble starch.

    At this point, student Wang Jingping thought: potatoes contain starch. So, he ground up potatoes, dissolved them in water, used the temperature near the stove to replace the incubator, and put the patient's urine into the starch solution. After reacting with iodine, the water turned blue. The makeshift method was successful in determining that the cooperative member was suffering from pancreatitis.

　　课本上没有的办法
    一天的傍晚，在北京朝阳区孙河乡医院里，来了一位农业社员，他的上腹部疼痛得很厉害。有的大夫认为这是胃肠炎，北京医学院医疗系应届毕业的几个学生，经再三诊断后怀疑是胰腺炎。
    在学校里他们可以用保温箱和可溶性淀粉立即进行“淀粉酶”的测定，就会马上作出肯定的判断。可是，现在是在农村，既没有保温箱，也没有现成的可溶性淀粉。
    这时，学生王靖平就想：土豆里有淀粉，于是把土豆磨碎，溶解在水中，借灶旁温度代替保温箱，把病人的尿放在溶有淀粉的水中，和碘起作用后，水呈蓝色。土办法测定成功了。证明这个社员是患的胰腺炎。
