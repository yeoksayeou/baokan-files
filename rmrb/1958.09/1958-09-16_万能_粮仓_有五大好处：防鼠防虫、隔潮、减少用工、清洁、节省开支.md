    "All-Purpose" Granary
    Has Five Major Benefits: Rodent and Insect Proofing, Moisture Barrier, Reduced Labor, Cleanliness, and Cost Savings

    (By Our Newspaper) The Huajiazhuang Grain Depot in Lu'an County, Shanxi Province, has successfully created a new type of granary for long-term storage without grain spoilage. It is currently being vigorously promoted throughout Shanxi Province.
    This type of warehouse does not require the laying of protective materials such as straw or mats inside the warehouse. It has a great capacity for moisture resistance and temperature reduction. It is a new development of the Huajiazhuang Grain Depot staff after learning from the advanced experience of the "no-equipment granary" in Jiaozhuang, Ye County, Henan Province. Therefore, people call it the "new no-equipment granary." It has unique and significant innovations in both structure and practicality. The raw materials used are mainly river sand, fire bricks (unsoaked green bricks), anthracite coal, and wooden boards. When renovating the warehouse floor, dig seven inches to one foot deep, flatten and compact it so that it is higher than the ground level outside the warehouse. After it is dry, first lay three to four inches of anthracite coal, then lay about three inches of dry river sand, and then build fire bricks on top, smoothing and polishing with straw ash mud. At a distance of five to seven inches from the surrounding walls of the warehouse, build a section of attached wall with bricks, adding dry river sand inside and nailing protective wooden boards on the outside. After this new method was successfully tested by Wang Jinwang and other staff members of the Huajiazhuang Grain Depot, they worked hard for ten days to transform all fifteen warehouses with thirty-nine rooms in the entire depot.
    Recently, representatives from various parts of Shanxi Province visited this type of warehouse and summarized that this type of warehouse has five major benefits: First, it can prevent rodents and insects. The sand and bricks used for building the warehouse are inorganic and have no nutritional value. The sand itself has a slippery quality, making it difficult for rats to move when they dig holes, as it obstructs their vision and mouths. This type of warehouse does not lay materials such as straw or mats, avoiding the infection and parasitism of insect pests, insect eggs, mud, and dust. Second, because coal, sand, and fire bricks have a strong moisture-resistant effect, the inside of the warehouse can be kept dry all year round, reducing the temperature inside the warehouse and preventing grain from becoming moldy. After testing, the humidity inside this type of warehouse is about 15% lower than that of ordinary warehouses. Third, it reduces the labor required for inspecting and cleaning the warehouse and sun-drying equipment, greatly improving work efficiency. Fourth, it ensures the cleanliness of the warehouse, reduces soil in the grain, maintains the purity and freshness of the grain, and extends the service life of the warehouse. Preliminary assessments indicate that this type of warehouse can be used for twenty years. Fifth, it saves expenses. This year, the staff of the Huajiazhuang Grain Depot used this type of warehouse to store grain, and the average cost per 10,000 jin of capacity was 2 yuan and 67 fen, saving 10% compared to the original planned target. If calculated based on the service life, the savings will be even greater than this year's cost quota. In addition, ordinary residential buildings can also be converted into this type of warehouse.

    “万能”粮仓
    有五大好处：防鼠防虫、隔潮、减少用工、清洁、节省开支
    本报讯　山西潞安县化家庄粮库职工创造成功一种长期储存不损坏粮食的新仓库。最近正在山西全省范围内大力推广。
    这种仓库库内不用铺垫谷草、席子等防护器材，防潮降温能力很大，是化家庄粮库职工学习河南省叶县焦庄“无器材粮仓”先进经验后的新发展，因此人们把它叫作“新无器材粮仓”，无论在结构上、实用上都有了独特的重大创造。所用原料主要是河砂、火砖（未经水浸的青砖）、无烟煤和木板。在仓库整修仓底时挖七寸到一尺深，摊平压实要高于库外地平线，等干燥后先铺三、四寸厚的无烟煤，后铺三寸左右干河砂，然后在上边砌上火砖，用秸灰泥抹平压光。在离仓库四周墙壁五至七寸的地方，用砖砌一段附墙，内添干河砂、外钉护墙木板。这种新作法经化家庄粮库职工王金旺等试验成功后，他们苦战十天，把全库的十五座三十九间仓库都进行了改造。
    最近山西省各地代表到这里参观了这种仓库，总结出这种仓库有五大好处：一、能防鼠、防虫。筑库用的砂、砖都是无机质，没有任何营养价值；砂本身有流滑性，老鼠盗洞时迷目、堵嘴很难活动；这种仓库不铺垫谷草、席子等器材，避免了虫害、虫卵、泥土、灰尘的感染和寄生。二、因为煤、砂和火砖有强烈的隔潮作用，可以常年保持库内干燥，降低库内温度，防止粮食霉变。经过检验这种仓库库内湿度较一般仓库降低了15％左右。三、减少了检库清库、曝晒器材用工，大大提高了工作效率。四、保证库内清洁，减少土粮，保持了粮食的纯洁和色泽鲜美，并且延长了库房使用年限。初步鉴定这种仓库可使用二十年。五、节省开支。化家庄粮库职工今年用这种仓库保管粮食，每万斤容量平均费用两元六角七分，比原计划指标节约费用10％。如按使用年限计算，比今年的费用定额节省更多。另外一般民房都可以改制成这种仓库。
