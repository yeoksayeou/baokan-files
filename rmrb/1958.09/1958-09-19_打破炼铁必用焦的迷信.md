Breaking Down the Superstition that Ironmaking Must Use Coke
By a staff commentator of this newspaper

Ironmaking is like cooking a meal, it must use fuel, this is something everyone knows. However, perhaps many people don't know that in the question of what fuel to use, in the past, whether for indigenous or foreign blast furnaces, a kind of fastidiousness has been cultivated, and a superstition exists. Moreover, the larger the furnace, the heavier the fastidiousness. This fastidiousness, this superstition is: ironmaking must use coke. If it is a modern furnace, the coke used must also adhere to strict "coal blending ratios," definitely so much coal from here, so much coal from there. It is said that only coke produced in this way can be used for ironmaking, otherwise iron cannot be produced, or not much can be produced, or it won't be of good quality. Of course, we should admit that it is best to use coke for ironmaking, especially for modern large furnaces. However, like with all problems, we cannot absolutize and mystify it. To say that ironmaking must use coke, that coke production must use certain kinds of coal, “fixed” and unchangeable, is not in accordance with science. Things are developing, changeable, and ironmaking can also be done without coke, which is in accordance with dialectical science.

This fastidiousness and superstition towards coking coal has for a long time caused irrationality in railway transportation: either long-distance transport, carrying coking coal from Heilongjiang thousands of miles to the south; or transport in opposite directions, coal from location A transported to location B, and coal from location B transported back to location A.

This situation could be maintained in normal times. Once the Great Leap Forward began, the contradictions became acute. Now, the more than 300,000 indigenous blast furnaces across the country all need coking coal, and the output of large blast furnaces is increasing exponentially, using even more coking coal. Consequently, the production of coking coal cannot keep up, and the railways also cannot transport it in time. The problem of coking coal has transformed into a key issue for guaranteeing the doubling of steel production. If this problem is not solved, the task of 10.7 million tons of steel cannot be guaranteed.

To solve this problem, of course the coal sector must leap forward, and the railway sector must leap forward. However, steel smelting cannot solely rely on the support of others, it must also overcome its own difficulties. The solution to overcome this difficulty now exists, and that is to discard the fastidiousness of being picky about fuel, break down the superstition about coke and "coal blending ratios," and experiment with and promote the use of anthracite (smokeless coal) for ironmaking, using any kind of coal for ironmaking. Guangxi, Guizhou, Shanxi, Hunan, Gansu and other places already have some furnaces that have successfully experimented with using anthracite to make iron. Recently, the Northeast put forward the slogan "Don't be superstitious about Fushun coal," and the Jiangsu Provincial Coal Bureau has already broken the "coal blending ratio," which was once considered sacred and inviolable. Once these units liberated their thinking and broke down superstition, the path widened, and the threat of insufficient coke supply to the increase in pig iron production was reduced and eliminated. We must promote these experiences at the fastest speed. We must use these successful examples to refute those who are conditionalists and coke fundamentalists. By promoting these experiences, many places can obtain materials locally and rely on their own efforts. The southern provinces lacking coking coal can cut down fewer trees and use less charcoal. Insufficient coking coal is the most prominent difficulty at present, and the experience of anthracite ironmaking is the most powerful weapon to overcome this difficulty. All localities should promote anthracite ironmaking with a fighting spirit and a revolutionary spirit. Solving this problem is not only solving the problem of insufficient coking coal, but also opening up new avenues for ironmaking in thousands upon thousands of small and indigenous blast furnaces, which is of utmost importance for guaranteeing the completion of this year's production plan of 10.7 million tons of steel.

    打破炼铁必用焦的迷信
    本报评论员
    炼铁和做饭一样，必须用燃料，这是大家都知道的，但是，可能很多人不知道，在使用什么燃料这个问题上，过去不论土高炉或洋高炉，都给养成了一股娇气，存在着一种迷信。而且炉子越大，娇气越重。这股娇气，这种迷信就是：炼铁必须用焦。如果是现代化的炉子，所用的焦还必须遵守严格的“配煤比”，一定要这里的煤多少，那里的煤多少。据说，这样炼出来的焦才能够去炼铁，否则就炼不出铁，或者是炼不多，炼不好。当然，我们应当承认，炼铁最好是用焦，特别是近代化大炉子，更要用焦。但是，像对待一切问题一样，不能把它绝对化和神秘化了。说炼铁一定要用焦，炼焦一定要用某几种煤，“笃定”不可更改，这并不合乎科学。事物是发展的，可变的，炼铁也可以不用焦，这才是合乎辩证法的科学。
    对待焦煤的这股娇气，这种迷信，长期以来造成着铁路运输上的不合理：不是远途运输，从黑龙江奔波几千里把焦煤运到南方；就是相向运输，甲地的煤运到乙地，乙地的煤又运到甲地。
    这种状况，平时还可以维持。一到大跃进，矛盾就尖锐化了。现在，全国三十多万座土高炉，都要用炼焦煤，大高炉产量加番，焦煤用得更多。于是，炼焦煤的生产赶不上，铁路也运不及，焦煤的问题一变而成为保证钢产量加番的首要关键，这个问题不解决，一千零七十万吨钢的任务就不能保证。
    要解决这个问题，当然煤炭部门要跃进，铁道部门要跃进。但是，钢铁冶炼不能光靠别人支援，自己也要克服困难。克服这个困难的办法现在已经有了，这就是打掉对燃料百般挑剔的娇气，打破对焦炭和“配煤比”的迷信，试验和推广用白煤（无烟煤）炼铁，用任何种类的煤炼铁。广西、贵州、山西、湖南、甘肃等地有一些炉子现在已经试验成功了用白煤炼铁，东北最近提出了“不要迷信抚顺煤”的口号，江苏省煤炭局已经打破了一向是神圣不可侵犯的“配煤比”。这些单位，思想一解放，迷信一打破，路子就宽了，焦炭供应不足对生铁增产的威胁就减轻了、消除了。对于这些经验，我们要用最快的速度推广。要用这些成功的例子打破那些条件论者和唯焦炭论者。推广了这些经验，许多地方就可以就地取材，自力更生，南方缺焦煤的各省，就可以少伐木材，少用木炭。焦煤不足是当前最突出的困难，克服这个困难，白煤炼铁的经验是最有力的武器。各个地方都应当用战斗的精神、革命的精神来推广白煤炼铁。解决了这个问题，不仅仅是解决了焦煤不足的问题，而且为千千万万的小高炉、土高炉炼铁开辟了新的道路，对保证完成今年一千零七十万吨钢的生产计划，有着极其重要的意义。
