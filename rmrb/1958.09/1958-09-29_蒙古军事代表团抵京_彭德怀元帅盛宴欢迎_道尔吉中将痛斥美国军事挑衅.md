Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: The head of the Mongolian military delegation visiting China, Minister of Military and Public Security Dorj, said upon arrival at Beijing Airport this morning that the Mongolian people and their army, together with all righteous humanity, condemn the American aggressors for intensifying tensions in the Far East, carrying out crude provocations against the People's Republic of China on Taiwan and its adjacent islands, and expanding aggression. The Mongolian people and their army fully agree with and support the resolute measures repeatedly taken by the government of the People's Republic of China to stop the blatant aggression of American imperialism, to liberate Taiwan and its adjacent islands, which are inseparable territories of China, and to safeguard peace in Asia and the world. They are filled with eagerness to contribute to this sacred and just cause.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that there is a long-standing, brotherly, and combative friendship between the people and armies of China and Mongolia. During our country's Second Revolutionary Civil War, the Mongolian people extended great sympathy and concern for our revolutionary struggle. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the Mongolian people sent troops to defeat the Japanese fascist aggressors along with us. During the period of peaceful construction, we also provided mutual support. Today, the military delegation headed by Lieutenant General Dorj has come to visit our country again, which will surely further enhance the friendship and unity between the people of China and Mongolia, especially between the two armies.

On behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Marshal Peng Dehuai expressed heartfelt gratitude and a warm welcome to the envoys of friendship from the Mongolian people and the People's Army.

Lieutenant General Dorj said in his speech that we feel very honored to come to your beautiful capital at a time when the great Chinese people are in the midst of a great leap forward in socialist construction and are filled with high morale to liberate their indivisible territory of Taiwan. The friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples and their armies is growing stronger day by day and will make a greater contribution to defending peace in the Far East and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai received all members of the Mongolian People's Republic military delegation visiting China, headed by Lieutenant General Bat-Dorj, at 3:00 PM today.

At the beginning of the banquet, Marshal Peng Dehuai said, "Today, we are very pleased to hold a banquet here to welcome our close comrades-in-arms, the military delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic. There is a long and profound friendship between the people and armies of China and Mongolia. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the combat friendship between our two countries has been further developed. China and Mongolia are both concerned about and support each other in socialist construction. Our brotherly friendly cooperation is developing day by day and is producing beneficial results." Marshal Peng Dehuai said, "I firmly believe that this visit by the military delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic will further strengthen the fraternal friendship between the people and armies of our two countries, thereby benefiting our common cause of building socialism and safeguarding peace."

Lieutenant General Bat-Dorj said in his speech that the Mongolian people and army express extreme indignation at the American imperialism's expanding aggression against our great neighbor, the People's Republic of China. If American imperialism does not stop its aggressive activities, it will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

The banquet was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere. The hosts and guests frequently toasted the great achievements made by the people of China and Mongolia in socialist construction, and the combat friendship between the people and armies of China and Mongolia!
