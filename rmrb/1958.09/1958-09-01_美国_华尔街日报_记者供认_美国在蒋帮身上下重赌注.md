Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: New York news: The "Wall Street Journal" published an article on the 27th by its reporter Ognianesov, datelined from Taipei. The author admitted that the U.S. government is giving large amounts of aid to the traitor Chiang Kai-shek group to prevent the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan. Ognianesov acknowledged that this U.S. aid, which maintains the cruel rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitor over Taiwan, has aroused anger and dissatisfaction among the people of Taiwan.

Ognianesov said that in the past few days, international attention has been focused on the U.S.-made Sabre jet fighters and former U.S. tank landing craft "gifts" sent by the United States to Chiang Kai-shek's army. The former has been in mixed combat with Chinese jet aircraft, and the latter is said to have been used to transport Chiang Kai-shek's troops from Taiwan to Jinmen Island. Ognianesov said that other military aid items supplied by the United States to Chiang Kai-shek include tanks, howitzers, trucks, rifles, destroyers, and approximately 1,800 U.S. military officers and personnel from the "Military Assistance Advisory Group," who have been imparting various knowledge to the Chiang Kai-shek elements, from the secrets of saving money by centralized grain purchases to the secrets of training techniques.

Ognianesov pointed out that since 1951, the United States has "poured" aid worth approximately $2 billion into the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, a large portion of which is military equipment aid. But this is only the portion that has been revealed. Ognianesov acknowledged that the purpose of the U.S. aid to the Chiang Kai-shek group is "to strengthen this island fortress militarily and economically."

Ognianesov also admitted that U.S. aid is also intended to help Chiang Kai-shek deal with his
  “increasingly aging army” because most of the soldiers who fled with Chiang Kai-shek are rapidly exceeding their fighting age.

Ognianesov pointed out that U.S. aid to the Chiang Kai-shek group has aroused dissatisfaction among Taiwan residents. He said that people do not have a good impression of U.S. gifts and the presence of U.S. soldiers on their island -- this anger prompted the anti-American riots that broke out not long ago. In addition, some local residents do not like U.S. aid because it strengthens the Chiang gang and its harsh rule over Taiwan.

### 美国“华尔街日报”记者供认  美国在蒋帮身上下重赌注

    美国“华尔街日报”记者供认
　　美国在蒋帮身上下重赌注
    据新华社31日讯　纽约消息：“华尔街日报”27日刊载了它的记者奥加涅索夫发自台北的一篇文章，作者供认美国政府正在给卖国贼蒋介石集团大笔援助，以阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土台湾。奥加涅索夫承认，美国这种维护蒋介石卖国贼对台湾的残酷统治的援助，已引起台湾人民的愤怒和不满。
    奥加涅索夫说，在过去几天中，国际间的注意力一直集中在美国送给蒋介石军队的美制佩刀式喷气战斗机以及以前的美国坦克登陆艇等“礼物”上，前者一直在同中国的喷气机进行混战，后者据说也一直被用于将蒋介石的军队从台湾运往金门岛。奥加涅索夫说，美国供应给蒋介石的其他军事援助物品有坦克、榴弹炮、卡车、步枪、驱逐舰以及一千八百名左右的美国军官和“军事援助顾问团”的人员，他们一直在传授蒋介石分子各种知识，自集中购粮的省钱秘密直到训练技术秘诀。
    奥加涅索夫指出，自从1951年以来，美国对台湾蒋介石卖国集团已经“倾注了”价值约二十亿美元的援助，其中很大一部分是军备的援助。但这仅仅是透露出来的那一部分。奥加涅索夫承认，美国对蒋介石集团的援助的目的是“要在军事上和经济上加强这个岛屿堡垒”。
    奥加涅索夫还承认，美国的援助还为了要帮助蒋介石处理他的
  “年纪越来越大的军队”。因为和蒋介石一起逃走的军队中的大部分人正在迅速地超过他们的战斗年龄。
    奥加涅索夫指出，美国给蒋介石集团的援助在台湾居民中招致不满。他说，人们对美国的恩赐以及对美国兵驻在他们的岛上并无好感——这种愤怒情绪促使在不久前爆发了反美的骚乱。另外，还有一些当地居民不喜欢美国的援助，因为这种援助加强蒋帮及其对台湾的严酷的统治。
