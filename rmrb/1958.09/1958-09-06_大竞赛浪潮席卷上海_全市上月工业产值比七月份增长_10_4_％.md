Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 5th: A magnificent and powerful high tide of re-leap forward has recently been set off on the Shanghai industrial production front. According to statistics, the city's total industrial output value in August increased by 10.4% compared with July, the largest increase since April this year; an increase of 72.1% compared with the same month last year.

The call for a leap forward and a re-leap forward issued by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 15 has become the conscious action of the vast number of workers. The mass-based competition to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced has rapidly unfolded in Shanghai factories for more than half a month.

New records and new creations are particularly numerous, which is a distinct feature of August. The open-hearth furnace workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, which has always been a national leader in utilization coefficient, reached a new peak of 14.227 tons of steel produced per square meter of furnace bottom per day and night in August, an increase of 1.74 tons compared with July. In the first half of the month, they failed to complete the plan, but in the second half of the month, they successively created new records of smelting a furnace of steel in two hours and fifty-seven minutes and two hours and fifty-three minutes (more than one hour faster than planned), and they stubbornly grabbed back the tasks that had been dropped step by step, and overfulfilled the monthly leap forward target of 8,800 tons of steel. The Jiangnan Shipyard not only built a 5,000-ton deadweight sea-going vessel at a high speed of five months and twelve days, but also created a new record of launching twenty-seven new ships in the same month in August.

A new upsurge of technical revolution has emerged throughout the city, and major reforms have appeared in all walks of life. Many reforms have not only played an important role in completing the immediate plan, but will also have a profound impact on future production. For example, the Shanghai Associated Electrical Equipment Factory has improved the design of ten major products. In the last four months of this year, only less than half of the original metal materials will be used to complete all production tasks, which can save more than 1,500 tons of raw materials such as iron and copper, and the output and quality of products have also been greatly improved.

In order to jointly complete the leap forward target, the communist style of mutual help and mutual support among the vast number of workers has been unprecedentedly high. The workers of the two open-hearth furnaces of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant are not only opponents in the competition for the red flag, but also close brothers in cooperation. Sun Wanyin's team of the No. 2 open-hearth furnace is good at slagging, so they taught the slagging experience to their opponent, Han Xinliang's team of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace; Han Xinliang's team feeds materials quickly, so they introduced the material feeding experience to Sun Wanyin's team.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently analyzed the current situation and required party organizations and leaders at all levels to further mobilize the masses and focus closely on completing the leap forward plan and making great efforts in the technical revolution.

### 大竞赛浪潮席卷上海  全市上月工业产值比七月份增长10.4％

　　大竞赛浪潮席卷上海
    全市上月工业产值比七月份增长10.4％
    据新华社上海5日电　上海工业生产战线上最近掀起了一个规模壮阔、声势浩大的再跃进的高潮。据统计，全市8月份工业总产值比7月份增长10.4％，是今年4月份以来增长幅度最大的一个月；比去年同月增长72.1％。
    中共上海市委8月15日发出的跃进再跃进号召，已经变成广大职工自觉的行动。群众性的学先进、赶先进、超过先进的竞赛，半个多月来已在上海各工厂中迅速展开。
    新纪录、新创造特别多，是8月份一个鲜明的特点。利用系数一直在全国领先的上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间，8月份又达到了每一昼夜每一平方公尺炉底产钢十四点二二七吨的新高峰，比7月份再提高一点七四吨。上半月他们没有完成计划，下半月便接连创造出二小时五十七分、二小时五十三分（比计划快一小时多）炼一炉钢的新纪录，硬是把脱下来的任务一步一步地抓了回来，超额完成了八千八百吨钢的月度跃进指标。江南造船厂不仅以五个月十二天的高速度建成一艘载重量五千吨的海轮，8月份还创造了二十七艘新船同月下水的最新纪录。
  全市技术革命出现了新高潮，重大的改革在各行各业接连出现。许多改革不仅对完成眼前计划起了重要作用，而且对今后生产将发生深远的影响。例如，上联电工器材厂改进了十种主要产品的设计，今年后四个月只要用原来一半不到的金属材料就能完成全部生产任务，可以节约铁、铜等原材料一千五百多吨，而且产品的产量、质量也大大提高。
    为了共同完成跃进指标，广大职工互相帮助、互相支援的共产主义风格空前高涨。上海第三钢铁厂两座平炉的工人，既是争夺竞赛红旗的对手，又是亲密合作的兄弟。二号平炉孙万银小组造渣好，就把造渣经验教给对手——一号平炉韩忻亮小组；韩忻亮小组进料快，就把进料经验介绍给孙万银小组。
    中共上海市委最近分析了当前的形势，要求各级党组织和领导人员进一步发动群众，紧紧围绕着完成跃进计划，大闹技术革命。
