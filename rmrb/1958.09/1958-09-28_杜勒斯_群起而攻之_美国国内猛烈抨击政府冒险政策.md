Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 27th: United States Secretary of State Dulles's speech on the Taiwan Strait situation on the 25th has not only failed to quell the anxiety and unease within the United States regarding the government's war-mongering policies but has also sparked fierce criticism.

Democratic Senator Morse said on the 26th that "he (Dulles)'s speech was full of appalling lies, and he ridiculed intelligent Americans."

He said, "According to international law, we have no right to interfere in Jinmen and Mazu, and if we become militarily involved there, we will become an aggressor nation." He said: "We have no right to kill American youths over the issue of Jinmen and Mazu."

Associated Press commentator Ryan pointed out that Dulles's speech "did not untie the dead knot of American policy." He said, "Most world opinion seems to believe that the United States's position on the entire coastal island issue is hopelessly untenable. Many allies also believe that American support for Chiang Kai-shek's dream of recovering the mainland is a constant and growing threat to peace in Asia and the world."

Analyzing Dulles's speech, Ryan noted that Dulles said that the United States would not retreat in the face of "force or the threat of force," but "our attitude is flexible in other respects."

Ryan asked: "What does this mean? Does this mean that the Communists can hope to obtain these islands if they abandon the use of force? If that is not what it means, then American policy is still inflexible. In that case, the United States must continue to support Chiang Kai-shek's occupation of those coastal islands. Does it mean that it is possible to hand over the coastal islands to the Communists through negotiation? If so, no matter what Dulles says, the United States is still retreating." Ryan said, "How great is this flexibility? This is a question that has not yet been answered."

Ryan concluded that Dulles's speech "still seems to imply American hesitation and weakness."

At the same time, many people in the United States continue to criticize the American government's war-mongering policies. Former President Truman accused the Eisenhower administration on the 25th of pursuing policies that have caused America's allies and friends to "leave us, fearful and uneasy."

Retired banker and diplomat Warburg published an open letter to Eisenhower in the "New York Times" on the 25th, demanding that Congress reconvene immediately to re-examine American policy toward China.

Florida Democratic Senator Smathers said that it would be unwise for the United States to risk atomic war for "coastal islands that have belonged to mainland China since ancient times…"

Wyoming Democratic Senator O'Mahoney pointed out that the American government seems not to have imagined how terrible a responsibility the American government must bear for all of humanity in the atomic age.

Pennsylvania State Representative Dent, a Democrat, who recently returned from a visit to the Soviet Union, said that Europeans with whom he had spoken about the Taiwan Strait crisis problem believed that the United States was taking "insane action to risk starting a real war."

    杜勒斯——群起而攻之
    美国国内猛烈抨击政府冒险政策
    据新华社27日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯25日就台湾海峡局势发表的演说，不仅没有平息美国国内对政府战争冒险政策的焦虑和不安，而且引起了猛烈的抨击。
    民主党参议员莫尔斯26日说，“他（杜勒斯）的演说充满了骇人的谎言，他嘲笑了有头脑的美国人。
    他说，“根据国际法，我们没有任何权利过问金门和马祖，如果在军事上我们牵连在那里的话，我们将成为一个侵略的国家。”他说：“我们没有权利在金门和马祖问题上杀害美国青年。”
    美联社评论员瑞安指出，杜勒斯的演说“并没有打开美国政策的死结”。他说，“目前大部分世界舆论看来是认为美国在整个沿海岛屿问题上的立场是毫无希望地站不住脚的。许多盟国也认为美国支持蒋介石的收复大陆的梦想是对亚洲和世界和平的一个经常的和日益增长的威胁。”
    他分析杜勒斯的演说，杜勒斯说，美国将不在“武力或武力的威胁”前面退却，但是“我们的态度在其他方面是灵活的”。
    瑞安问道：“这是什么意思呢？难道这是意味着共产党放弃武力也能希望得到这些岛屿吗？如果不是这个意思，那么美国的政策还是不灵活的。在那种情况下，美国必须继续支持蒋介石占据那些沿海岛屿。它是否意味着有可能通过谈判把沿海岛屿送到共产党手里呢？那样一来，不管杜勒斯怎么说，美国还是退却了。”瑞安说，“这个灵活到底有多大呢？这是一个还没有得到解答的问题。”
    瑞安的结论是，杜勒斯的演说“看来还是暗示了美国的犹豫不决和软弱”。
    和这同时，在美国有许多人继续对美国政府的战争冒险政策提出批评。前总统杜鲁门25日指责艾森豪威尔政府的政策已经使得美国的盟国和朋友“正在离开我们，心情恐惧而不安”。
    退休的银行家和外交家华伯25日在“纽约时报”上发表了一封给艾森豪威尔的公开信，要求国会立即复会重新研究美国对华政策。
    佛罗里达州民主党参议员斯马瑟斯说，为了“自古以来就属于大陆中国的沿海岛屿……”去冒原子战争的危险对美国来说是不智之举。
    怀俄明州民主党参议员奥马洪尼指出，美国政府看来是没有想像到，在原子世纪里美国政府要对全体人类负多么可怕的责任。
    不久之前才访苏归来的宾夕法尼亚州众议院民主党议员登特说，同他交谈过有关台湾海峡危机问题的欧洲人认为，美国“冒险发动真正的战争”是一种疯狂的行动。
