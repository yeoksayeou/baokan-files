Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 19th: Tianjin has mobilized all its citizens to improve transportation, resulting in a rapid strengthening of the city's transportation capacity and an improvement in the previously strained transportation situation.

This year, Tianjin's urban transportation tasks increased by 70% compared to last year, and the existing transportation tools were already insufficient. After the central government issued the call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year, various units engaged in large-scale steelmaking, further exacerbating the transportation situation. In addition to fully tapping the potential of existing equipment, the transportation departments are determined to change their previous passive attitude of only asking the central government to increase the number of cars and purchase imported cars. They have adopted the method of breaking out of the confines of their own departments and mobilizing and relying on the broad masses of the people to solve the prominent contradiction of insufficient transportation capacity.

Since September 10th, Tianjin has established a Transportation Command, and districts have also established district commands. A mass movement to fight for steel transportation has unfolded throughout the city. Since the 10th, tens of thousands or thousands of people have participated in transportation work every day. All officers and soldiers of the Tianjin Municipal Government Cadre-Composed Militia Red Flag Division have been taking turns going to the transportation front. The Hongqiao District established a Steel Transportation Regiment, held a mobilization rally of more than 5,000 people on the 16th, and fully devoted itself to transportation work. The Tanggu District's Loading and Unloading Transportation Division includes an automobile transportation regiment, a horse-drawn carriage transportation regiment, a mass loading and unloading team, and a ship transportation battalion. Students from Nankai University and Tianjin University, as well as government cadres and street residents, have also joined the ranks of urban transportation.

The transportation tools used in this mass transportation activity in Tianjin are very extensive. In addition to 1,700 transportation vehicles, more than 900 vehicles from government agencies and enterprises have been registered and are ready to be called upon at any time. All 4,000 horse-drawn carriages, 10,000 freight tricycles, and 300,000 bicycles in the city are gradually being called upon, and will be fully put into transportation when necessary. In addition to peak hours for commuters and Sundays, a small portion of the city's trams and buses have participated in transportation. Cleaning vehicles and small vendors' handcarts, except for work and business hours at night and in the morning, have also adopted the method of "people rest, vehicles don't," and have gone to the steel transportation front.

Now, on the avenues leading from Tianjin's four railway stations to the steel mills, there is a constant flow of traffic, bustling with activity day and night. From the 10th to the 15th, 940 carloads of materials have been transported. The masses' enthusiasm for transporting materials for steel production is very high. On the 9th and 10th, 8,000 tricycles in the city transported more than 30,000 tons of scrap steel to the steel mills. On the 12th, more than 1,000 street residents went to the Tianjin Steel Mill in formation to unload and transport goods. On the 13th, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee, led by Vice Mayor Li Quanchao, organized a bicycle transportation team of more than 1,700 people to transport materials to the Tianjin Steel Mill. Currently, this mass transportation activity is still expanding and developing.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 19th (Correspondents Kang Pang, Guo Junlou): Taiyuan's transportation tasks from September to December this year are very heavy. Due to insufficient existing transportation capacity, a tight transportation situation has emerged. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee have recently determined the following twelve effective measures to strive for self-reliance and solve the problem of insufficient transportation capacity as soon as possible, and ensure the completion of this year's transportation tasks.

   1. All transportation tools in the city, in addition to prioritizing the completion of their own units' transportation tasks, are completely under the unified control and command of the Transportation Bureau, included in the plan, and used uniformly. At the same time, improve transportation efficiency and ensure the completion of the assigned transportation tasks.
   2. All transportation tools in the city, wherever conditions permit, should implement a two-shift or three-shift system. Only people are allowed to rest, not transportation tools, to improve the utilization rate of existing equipment. All trucks, Zhongji jeep, and Xiaoji jeep, wherever conditions permit, should be equipped with trailers. Any trailer buckets that are not in use should be taken out to support the transportation company.
   3. The transportation of grain, vegetables, and other items for collective food units in all government agencies, schools, factories, mines, enterprises, and other organizations should be entirely self-supplied and self-transported, restoring the style of carrying grain on one's back.
   4. The public bus company's buses should adopt methods of reducing routes, extending buses, and rotating shifts to engage in freight transportation and support transportation.
   5. Convert tricycles into flatbed trucks for transportation, and promote the carrying of goods by tricycles and personal bicycles to increase some transportation capacity.
   6. Transfer a portion of car drivers from various government agencies, schools, and enterprises to support the transportation company and public bus company for a minimum of three months, and return to their original units after completing the training of new drivers and transportation tasks.
   7. Strengthen maintenance and frequent repairs of existing cars and various transportation tools to extend their life and improve their utilization rate.
   8. Take out the large sedans from various units to support the public bus company.
   9. Strengthen loading and unloading work, strengthen small-scale handling, and organize voluntary labor when there is a shortage of labor.
  10. Increase loading tonnage and improve short-distance transportation efficiency.
  11. Strengthen mutual cooperation and avoid empty return trips.
  12. Fully utilize the suburban railway lines.

    天津万人出动车水马龙日夜不息
    太原从十二个方面壮大运输力量
    本报天津19日电　天津市全民动员办交通，市内运输能力迅速加强，交通运输紧张情况正在好转。
    今年天津市的市内交通运输任务比去年增加70％，现有的交通运输工具已感到十分不足；中央提出年内生产一千零七十万吨钢的号召以后，各单位大炼钢铁，交通运输的情况更加紧张。交通运输部门除在原有的设备基础上大挖潜力以外，决心改变只想向中央要求增加汽车、购买进口汽车等消极等待态度，采取跳出本部门的圈子去发动和依靠广大人民群众的办法，来解决当前运输力量不足的突出的矛盾。
    9月10日起，天津市成立了运输指挥部，各区也先后建立了区指挥部。在全市范围内，一个为钢铁运输而战的群众性活动展开了。从10日以来，每天都有上万人或几千人参加运输工作。由天津市机关干部组成的基干民兵红旗师的全部官兵轮流开上了运输前线。红桥区成立了钢铁运输团，16日开了五千多人的誓师大会，全力投入交通运输工作。塘沽区的装卸运输师，包括汽车运输团、马车运输团、群众装卸团、船舶运输营。南开、天津两个大学的学生和机关干部、街道居民也都纷纷参加到市内运输的行列里来。
    这次天津市群众性的运输活动动用的运输工具非常广泛，除了一千七百部运输汽车外，机关企业的汽车已有九百多部进行登记，准备随时调用，全市四千辆马车，一万辆货运三轮车，三十万辆自行车正陆续开始调用，必要时将全部投入运输。市内电车和公共汽车除上下班、星期日乘客拥挤的时间以外，已有一小部分参加了运输。清洁车和小商贩的排子车，除夜间早晨工作营业时间以外，也采取人歇车不歇的办法，开赴钢铁运输前线。
    现在，从天津市的四个火车站通往钢厂的大道上，日夜车水马龙，熙熙攘攘。从10日到15日已运了九百四十个车皮的物资。群众为钢铁生产运输物资的情绪十分高涨，9、10两日，全市八千辆三轮车把三万多吨废钢铁运往钢厂。12日，一千多街道居民整队去天津钢厂卸运。13日，天津市人民委员会在副市长李权超率领下，组织了一千七百多人的自行车运输大队，到天津钢厂去运送物资。目前，这种群众性的运输活动，还正在扩大发展中。
    新华社太原19日电　通讯员康胖、郭俊楼报道：太原市今年9月到12月份的运输任务十分繁重，由于现有运输能力不足，目前已经出现了运输紧张的情况。中共太原市委和市人民委员会最近已确定以下十二项有效办法，力求自力更生地尽快解决运力不足问题，保证完成今年的运输任务。
    一、全市所有的运输工具，除了优先完成本单位的运输任务以外，其余完全由运输局统一掌握，统一指挥，列入计划，统一使用。同时提高运输效率，保证完成所分配的运输任务。

    三、各机关、学校、厂矿、企业等团体的集体伙食单位的吃粮、蔬菜等的运输，全部实行自吃自运，恢复背粮的作风。
    四、公共汽车公司的汽车，要采取减少线路、延长班车、轮班休息的办法搞货运，支援运输。
    五、把三轮车改成平板车搞运输，并且提倡三轮车和个人自行车带东西，以增加一部分运输力。
    六、从各机关、学校、企业中抽调一部分汽车司机，支援运输公司和公共汽车公司，时间最少三个月，完成培养新司机和运输任务后再回原单位。
    七、对现有汽车和各种运输工具要加强保养，勤修理，使其延长寿命，提高利用率。
    八、把各单位的大轿车抽出来支援公共汽车公司。
    九、加强装卸工作，加强小搬运，劳动力不足时组织义务劳动。
    十、提高装运吨位，提高短距离运输效率。
