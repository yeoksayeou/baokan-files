    Grasp the Important Link in Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification
    Comrade Tan Zhenlin Calls for Launching a Mass Movement Within a Month
    Use Rope-Traction Machines Nationwide for Deep Plowing
    Strive to Complete Comprehensive Utilization Next Year, and Transition from Human-Powered to Machine-Powered and Electric-Powered Traction, Accelerating Socialist Construction
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 19th: Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, praised the rope-traction machine as an effective weapon for deep plowing with broad prospects for development at the National Rope-Traction Machine On-site Conference in Nanjing. He called for striving to promote rope-traction machines to all communes and teams across the country within a month to meet the current needs of deep plowing for autumn planting, and striving to complete the comprehensive utilization of rope-traction machines next year.
    Comrade Tan Zhenlin outlined the rapidly advancing situation of industry and agriculture to representatives from twenty-seven provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country. He said that extremely great victories have been achieved on the agricultural front this year. National grain production can increase by 60% to 90%, or even more. Cotton production has the potential to more than double. Various crops, except for soybeans and flax, which have smaller increases, are increasing by double or several times. The great leap forward in agricultural production and the rapid improvement of farmers' awareness have promoted the high tide of people's communes in our country, creating a new situation of accelerating socialist construction, building socialism ahead of schedule, and gradually transitioning to communism.
    Comrade Tan Zhenlin pointed out that rope-traction machines are of great significance for accelerating socialist construction and gradually transitioning to communism. The current promotion of rope-traction machines is for deep plowing; further use will be for weeding, sowing, and transplanting, gradually becoming more perfect. At the same time, the existing human and animal-powered rope-traction machines should be upgraded to machine-powered and electric-powered traction. As long as everyone grasps this link, actively researches, and vigorously promotes it, our country may realize agricultural mechanization and electrification in a not very long time.
    Comrade Tan Zhenlin then talked about the position of agriculture in communist construction. He said: Without the great development of agriculture, there will be no communism. To make communism come faster, agriculture must be greatly developed. Each mu should not yield hundreds of jin, but thousands of jin, or ten thousand jin, and in the future it may reach thirty thousand jin or fifty thousand jin. Human understanding of nature is advancing step by step. If each mu of land produces ten thousand jin of grain, then one person only needs one-third of a mu, and six hundred million people only need one hundred and eighty million mu of land. At that time, a large amount of land can be taken out to plant trees and make the whole country into a garden. To achieve this, first, grain production must be high, and to achieve high grain production, first, the land must be deeply plowed, one chi, two chi, three chi deep. Only deep plowing can fully utilize the role of sufficient water and sufficient fertilizer, and close planting will have a foundation. Completing the deep plowing task for autumn planting is the key to ensuring a greater harvest next summer. Now, the autumn harvest and autumn planting are approaching, and the nationwide movement to produce steel is in full swing. The task is heavy and labor is insufficient. He asked the comrades present to make the greatest efforts, under the leadership and support of the Party, to mobilize the masses and strive to promote rope-traction machines to all communes and teams across the country within a month. He said: "After the meeting, everyone should immediately start manufacturing, manufacturing while demonstrating. Each province should distribute one to each county, and each county should distribute it to each commune. The commune should immediately launch a mass movement to promote rope-traction machines, and it will be possible to smoothly complete the deep plowing task for autumn planting."
    Comrade Tan Zhenlin's speech greatly encouraged the representatives present, and they all expressed their determination to complete the task on schedule. The representatives of Jiangsu Province attending the meeting stated that they would resolutely respond to Comrade Tan Zhenlin's call and strive to achieve rope-traction machine-ization throughout the province around September 20th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 19th: The National Rope-Traction Machine On-site Conference, which ended today, decided to launch a mass movement to vigorously develop rope-traction machines. Within a month, all communes and teams across the country must widely promote rope-traction machines mainly powered by human and animal power to meet the current needs of deep plowing.
    Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made an important speech at the meeting.
    This meeting was convened by the Ministry of Agriculture, and was attended by one hundred and fifty-six representatives from twenty-seven provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. After three and a half days of on-site meetings and discussions, the representatives unanimously agreed that this meeting solved two key problems for the current deep plowing movement. The first is to solve the problem of deep plowing power. Promoting rope-traction machines can greatly improve labor efficiency. Human-powered rope-traction machines generally improve labor efficiency by more than five times compared to digging by hand. Second, the problem of deep plowing plows has been solved. The on-site demonstration proved that the double-knife pulley-type deep plowing plow in Nanhui County, Jiangsu, can indeed plow deeply and stably, and can ensure the quality of plowing. The representatives unanimously agreed that this is the most satisfactory type of deep plowing plow created by the masses in various places. With the rope-traction machine, especially the rope-traction machine from Nantong equipped with three-layer rollers, plus the deep plowing plow from Nanhui, a relatively complete set of deep plowing tools has been formed. The meeting decided that Jiangsu should rush to manufacture this set of tools, distribute them to various provinces and regions as models, mass produce them, and quickly promote them.
    The meeting suggested that agricultural departments at all levels, people's communes, and agricultural machinery scientific research departments immediately start research and strive to complete the comprehensive utilization of rope-traction machines next year.
    Wang Yixiang, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Jiangsu Province, introduced the progress of promoting traction machines in Jiangsu at the meeting. As of September 15th, 150,000 traction machines have been promoted throughout the province. It is estimated that by the end of September, 600,000 units can be promoted throughout the province, completing rope-traction machine-ization.

    抓住农业机械化电气化的重要环节
    谭震林同志号召一个月内掀起群众运动
    全国用绳索牵引机来深耕
    力争在明年完成综合利用，再由人力带动提高到机力电力牵引，加速社会主义建设
    新华社南京19日电　中共中央书记处书记谭震林同志在南京全国绳索牵引机现场会议上赞誉绳索牵引机是深耕的有效武器，有远大的发展前途。他号召力争在一个月的时间内，把绳索牵引机推广到全国所有的社队，以适应当前秋种深翻的需要，并且力争在明年完成绳索牵引机的综合利用。
    谭震林同志向来自全国二十七个省、自治区、市的代表概述了工农业突飞猛进的形势。他说，今年农业战线上取得了十分伟大的胜利。全国的粮食可以增产60％到90％，或者更多一点。棉花有可能增产一倍以上。各种农作物，除了大豆、麻类增产幅度比较小以外，都是成倍、成几倍地增产。农业生产的大跃进，农民觉悟的迅速提高，促使我国出现了人民公社化的高潮，出现了加速社会主义建设，提前建成社会主义，并逐步向共产主义过渡的新形势。
    谭震林同志指出：绳索牵引机对于加速社会主义建设、逐步过渡到共产主义，有很大的意义。现在推广绳索牵引机，是为了深耕；再进一步使用它除草、播种、栽秧，一步一步地趋于完善。同时要使现有的人畜力带动的绳索牵引机，提高到由机力、电力牵引。只要大家抓紧这个环节，积极研究，大力推广，那末，我们这个国家就可能在不很长的时间内，实现农业的机械化、电气化。
    谭震林同志接着谈到了农业在共产主义建设中的地位。他说：没有农业的大发展，就没有共产主义，要共产主义来得快，就要农业大发展。每亩不是收到几百斤，而是收到几千斤、一万斤，将来也可以达到三万斤、五万斤。人对自然界的认识是一步步前进的，如果每亩田产一万斤粮，一个人只要三分地就够了，六亿人只要一亿八千万亩田就够了。到那时，就可以拿出大量的土地，种植树木，把全国园林化。要实现这一条，首先要粮食高产，而要粮食高产，首先要土地深耕，深耕一尺、二尺、三尺。只有深耕，才能充分发挥足水足肥的作用，密植才有基础。完成秋种的深耕任务，是保证明年夏季更大丰收的关键。现在，秋收秋种即将到来，全民大搞钢铁的运动正在火热的开展，任务很重，劳力不足，他要求到会的同志尽最大的努力，在党的领导与支持下，发动群众，力争在一个月内把绳索牵引机推广到全国各社队。他说：“大家在会议结束以后，回去立即制造，一面制造，一面表演，每个省发给每个县一部，每个县再发到每个社，社立即掀起一个推广绳索牵引机的群众运动，就有可能顺利地完成秋种的深翻任务。”
    谭震林同志的讲话，给到会代表极大的鼓舞，大家都表示有决心按期完成任务。出席会议的江苏省代表，表示坚决响应谭震林同志的号召、力争在9月20日左右实现全省的绳索牵引化。
    据新华社南京19日电　今天结束的全国绳索牵引机现场会议，决定开展一个群众性的大搞绳索牵引机的运动。在一个月内，全国各社、队要普遍推广以人、畜力为主的绳索牵引机，以适应当前深翻土地的需要。
    中共中央书记处书记谭震林在会上作了重要讲话。
    这次会议是由农业部召开的，出席二十七省、自治区、市的代表一百五十六人。代表们经过三天半的现场会议和讨论，一致认为这次会议给当前深翻土地运动解决了两个关键性的问题。第一是解决了深耕的动力问题。推广绳索牵引机可以大大提高劳动效率。人力的绳索牵引机一般比人挖地提高劳动效率五倍以上。第二，解决了深耕犁问题。现场表演证明，江苏南汇县的双刀滑轮式深耕犁，确实可以耕得又深又稳，并能确保翻地质量。代表们一致认为这是各地群众创造中的一种最合要求的深耕犁。有了绳索牵引机，特别是南通的装有三层滚柱的绳索牵引机，加上南汇的深耕犁，就合成了一套在目前比较完整的深耕工具。会议决定由江苏突击赶制这一套工具，分发全国各省、区作样子，大量制造，迅即推广。
    会议建议各级农业部门、人民公社、农业机械科学研究部门，立即着手研究，争取在明年完成绳索牵引机的综合利用。
    江苏省农林厅副厅长王一香在会上介绍了江苏推广牵引机的进度。到9月15日止，全省已推广牵引机十五万部。预计在9月底以前，全省可以推广六十万部，完成绳索牵引机化。
