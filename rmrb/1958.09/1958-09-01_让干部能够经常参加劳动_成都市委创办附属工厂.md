　　Allowing Cadres to Regularly Participate in Labor
　　Chengdu Municipal Party Committee Establishes Subsidiary Factory
　　(Our newspaper, Chengdu, 31st) The Chengdu Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has established an affiliated factory for its offices, which has already commenced production.

　　This affiliated factory began production on August 8th, mainly producing socks. It has now installed twelve electric sock knitting machines, producing more than forty dozen pairs of socks daily. The factory is located inside the offices.

　　Various units of the Chengdu Municipal Party Committee take turns sending personnel to this affiliated factory to participate in labor and learn. The cadres have a high enthusiasm for participating in production labor. Generally, it only takes seven and a half days of study to initially master the complete set of production techniques. Currently, one-third of the cadres can operate the machines for production. The affiliated factory has arranged the time for all cadres of the Municipal Party Committee to participate in labor at the factory. Without affecting daily work, each person has the opportunity to participate in half a day of production at the factory on average every four days.

　　After the establishment of this affiliated factory, cadres reported three major benefits: First, it provides an opportunity for office cadres to participate in labor training and contact reality within the offices, thereby ensuring that cadres can participate in production labor regularly. Second, the affiliated factory can flexibly control the arrangement of labor time and the number of laborers, without conflicting with the business work of various departments, so that work and labor can be carried out without hindrance. Third, the factory is located inside the offices, which helps to further cultivate a new atmosphere of diligence, thrift, and love for labor within the offices.

　　让干部能够经常参加劳动
　　成都市委创办附属工厂
    本报成都31日电  中共成都市委举办的一座机关附属工厂，已开工生产。
    这座机关附属工厂是在8月8日开工生产的，主要生产线袜，现在已经安装了十二台电力织袜机，每天织出四十多打线袜。厂房就设在机关里面。
    中共成都市委各单位都轮流派人到这个附属工厂去劳动学习，干部们参加生产劳动的热情很高，一般的只要学习七个半天就能初步掌握全套生产技术。现在，已经有三分之一的干部，能够掌握机器进行生产。附属工厂已把市委全体干部到厂参加劳动的时间作了安排，在不影响日常工作的情况下，平均每隔四天每人就有到厂里去参加半天生产的机会。
    这座机关附属工厂办起来以后，干部反映有三大好处：第一，使机关干部有了在机关内部参加劳动锻炼接触实际的机会，从而保证干部参加生产劳动能够经常化。第二，机关附属工厂在劳动时间、劳动人数的安排上，可以自己灵活掌握，不至于和各部门的业务工作发生冲突，能做到工作、劳动两不误。第三，工厂设在机关里面，有助于在机关内部进一步养成勤俭朴素、热爱劳动的新风尚。
