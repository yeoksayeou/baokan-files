Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to all service branches and arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army regarding the support of national steel production, requiring them to take immediate action, seize every second, and resolutely and earnestly support steel production.

The instructions stated that vigorously supporting the nation in completing the production target of 10.7 million tons of steel is a major political task for our army at present. Party committees at all levels must take personal command, ensuring that the entire army understands the enormous political significance of fulfilling or exceeding the 1958 annual steel production target according to the central plan, and resolutely and earnestly provide support.

The instructions said that the most important problems in steel production currently are: insufficient ore mining, a shortage of certain raw materials, and a lack of transportation. The army must assist in solving these difficulties in all aspects. The instructions stipulated: (1) Units should allocate 4,120 transport vehicles, quickly concentrate them locally, form motor vehicle battalions and companies, assign dedicated personnel to lead them, and be ready to be dispatched by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. (2) All units, service branches, arms, etc., should quickly inventory their warehouses, factories, harbors, etc., and report the quantity and variety of obsolete or scrapped aircraft, tank engines, automobile engines, and warship main engines to the Military Commission for transfer to the State Council for allocation. (3) In the current situation of insufficient ore mining, the recycling of scrap metal is a source for solving the shortage of raw materials. All units must mobilize and organize a certain amount of manpower to vigorously collect it and be ready for allocation.

In order to immediately and effectively support steel production, the instructions designated the General Staff Department to establish an office, and major units to establish working groups, requiring all units to take immediate action, seize every second, and not allow any delays.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: While closely monitoring the situation in the Taiwan Strait and standing ready to severely punish aggressors at any time, the various arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with a spirit of seizing every second, have plunged into the struggle to increase steel production, drawing large numbers of personnel, materials, and vehicles, etc., to support the rapid rise of the steel "marshal."

The Party Committee of the Lanzhou area troops held a special meeting on the 18th to study support for steel production, deciding to allocate 105 vehicles to participate in transportation, and to make full use of returning vehicles performing tasks in Gannan and Qinghai to help local transportation of ore, coke, and other materials urgently needed on the steel front. All available vehicles, livestock, and manpower from all units, organs, and schools have been put into supporting steel production. A certain unit, having completed its training tasks ahead of schedule, decided to send the entire unit to the mountains to mine iron ore to supply raw materials for local iron smelting and their own iron smelting. The Lanzhou Troops Party Committee also decided that its affiliated automobile repair plants, ordnance repair plants, etc., will smelt 4,900 tons of steel in the next four months.

At an enlarged meeting held by the Party Committee of the Shenyang area troops on the evening of the 18th, it was decided to allocate 1,200 transport vehicles, organize 23 transport companies to support steel transportation, and require all units to quickly clear warehouses and factories, and take out scrapped aircraft, tanks, automobile engines, etc., to support the transportation front, and further collect scrap steel and iron to support steel production.

In the previous period, the Nanjing area troops had already allocated 161 vehicles and 1,329 horse-drawn carts to support national industrial construction, and had also dispatched 2,367 vehicles, traveling 600,000 kilometers to support local industrial transportation. Now the Party Committee has decided to allocate another 1,100 transport vehicles to support steel production.

While conducting war preparedness training, the Chengdu area troops have allocated a large amount of manpower to participate in the construction of various steel industrial bases and to go to mines to quarry and smelt iron. A certain unit completed more than 11,800 cubic meters of earth and stone work in ten days while supporting the expansion project of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant. In order to help develop the foundation project of the Yongchuan Iron and Steel Plant, a certain unit undertook the arduous task of opening mountains and splitting rocks, excavating more than 7,000 cubic meters of stone in seven days.

The Guangzhou area troops established a leading group for supporting steel production headed by Lieutenant General Wen Niansheng, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee and Deputy Commander, requiring all units to vigorously collect scrap steel and iron. Currently, 320 vehicles have been allocated, and more vehicles will continue to be allocated to steel transportation, and all units are required to run and manage the existing steel plants well, and the leading organs should focus on several steel plants with an annual output of 200,000 tons of steel, so that they can be put into production as soon as possible.

A certain unit of the Beijing area troops has also allocated 160 vehicles, running non-stop on the construction sites of key projects such as smelting, rolling, and machinery in Tianjin, with an average daily transfer volume of about 3,000 tons.

The Air Force has also dispatched transport aircraft groups to support steel production. On the 17th and 18th, a certain unit dispatched 14 aircraft, transporting steelmaking equipment from the Northeast and Southeast regions to the Southwest, Inner Mongolia, and some remote areas. Their timely transportation of Shanghai's blowers to Baotou ensured the construction and production of Baotou Steel.

    各军区大批人员车辆开赴钢铁战线
    新华社20日讯　中共中央军事委员会就支援国家钢铁生产问题，向中国人民解放军各军种兵种部队发出指示，要求立即行动起来，分秒必争，坚决认真地支援钢铁生产。
    指示说，大力支援国家完成一千零七十万吨钢的生产任务，是我军当前一项重大的政治任务。各级党委必须亲自挂帅，使全军懂得按中央计划完成或超额完成1958年度钢产任务的巨大政治意义，坚决认真进行支援。
    指示说，当前钢铁生产上最主要的问题是：矿石开采不足、某些原料供不应求和运输工具缺乏，军队必须从各方面协助解决这些困难。指示规定：（一）由各部队抽出运输汽车四千一百二十台，迅速就地集中，组成汽车营、连，指定专人带队，听候冶金工业部调配使用。（二）各部队、各军种、兵种等应迅速清查所属仓库、工厂、港湾等，将过时报废的飞机、坦克发动机、汽车引擎、舰艇主机的数量、品种报军委转报国务院调配使用。（三）在目前矿石开采不足的情况下，废金属的回收是解决原材料缺乏的一个来源，各部队必须动员与组织一定的人力，大力收集，听候调配使用。
    为了立即有效地支援钢铁生产，指示指定总参谋部成立一个办公室，各大单位成立工作组，要求各部队立即行动，分秒必争，不准有任何迟缓现象。
    据新华社20日讯　中国人民解放军各兵种部队，在密切注视台湾海峡形势，随时准备痛击侵略者的同时，以分秒必争的精神，投入了为钢铁加番而战的斗争，抽出大批人力、物力和车辆等，支援钢铁“元帅”迅速升帐。
    兰州地区部队党委18日召开专门会议研究支援钢铁生产，决定抽出一百零五台汽车参加运输，并充分利用在甘南、青海执行任务的回空车辆帮助地方运输矿石、焦炭和其它钢铁战线上急需的物资。各部队、机关和学校凡能抽出的车辆、畜力和人力全部投入支援钢铁生产。某部由于提前完成了训练任务，决定这支部队全部上山挖铁矿，来供应地方炼铁和自己炼铁的原料。兰州部队党委并决定所属汽车修配厂、军械修理厂等在今后四个月炼钢四千九百吨。
    沈阳地区部队党委18日晚上召开的扩大会议上，决定抽调一千二百台运输汽车，组织二十三个运输连，支援钢铁运输，并要求各部队迅速清理仓库、工厂，把报废的飞机、坦克、汽车发动机等拿出来支援运输战线，进一步搜集废钢废铁支援钢铁生产。
    南京地区部队在前一时期已调拨汽车一百六十一台和马车一千三百二十九辆支援国家工业建设，还出动了汽车两千三百六十七台次，行驶六十万公里支援地方工业运输。现在党委又决定再抽出一千一百台运输汽车支援钢铁生产。
    成都地区部队在战备训练的同时，抽出大批人力参加各个钢铁工业基地的建设和开赴矿山采石炼铁。某部在支援重庆钢铁厂扩建工程中，十天完成了一万一千八百多个土石方。某部为了帮助开拓永川钢铁厂地基工程，担负了开山劈石的艰巨工程，七天开出七千多个石方。
    广州地区部队成立了以党委副书记、副司令员文年生中将为首的支援钢铁生产领导小组，要求各部队大力搜集废钢铁，目前已抽调三百二十台汽车，还将继续抽调汽车投入钢铁运输，并要求各部队开办和经营好现有的钢铁厂，领导机关抓住几座年产二十万吨钢的钢铁厂，使其早日投入生产。
    北京地区部队某部还抽出了一百六十辆汽车，在天津市冶炼、轧钢、机械等重点工程工地上奔驰不息，每天平均转运量三千吨左右。
    空军部队还派出了运输机群来支援钢铁生产。17、18两天，某部队出动了十四架飞机，把东北、东南地区的炼钢设备运到了西南、内蒙古和一些边远地区。他们把上海的鼓风机及时运到包头以后，保证了包钢的建设和生产。
