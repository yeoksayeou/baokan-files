Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th September: The Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 1 Blast Furnace, from the moment it tapped its first batch of molten iron at 3:25 PM on the 13th, had produced six batches of iron by 3:00 PM on the 14th. In the twenty-four hours of production, the entire blast furnace system operated normally, with molten iron tapped every four hours. The tapping process was very smooth, production continued to increase, and the quality of the iron reached excellent levels.

According to Li Feng'en, chief technician in front of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 1 Blast Furnace and a former veteran worker at Anshan Iron and Steel, such smooth production by a large new blast furnace within a day and night was unprecedented in Anshan's history. The reason why the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 1 Blast Furnace has achieved this is mainly because the workers have put politics in command. Everyone has set targets, and all aspects are cooperating with each other, paying close attention to every link in the chain.

    武钢一号高炉运转正常
    据新华社武汉16日电　武钢一号高炉从13日下午三点二十五分流出第一炉铁水起，到14日下午三时止，已经出了六炉铁。在二十四小时的生产中，整个高炉系统运转正常，铁水每隔四小时流出一次，出铁非常顺利，产量不断增加，铁的质量也达到优等。
    据武钢一号高炉炉前总技师、前鞍钢老工人李凤恩说，一座大型新高炉在一昼夜里能够这样顺利生产，在鞍山历史上是没有的。武钢一号高炉所以能够这样，主要是工人们政治挂了帅，大家都订了规划，各方面相互协作，每一个环节都抓得很紧。
