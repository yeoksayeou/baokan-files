Guangxi Summer Grain Production More Than Doubles

(Our report) Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of summer grain crops this year. The total output of early rice and early and mid-season corn in the region reached 8,006,500,000 jin, an increase of 110% compared to last year. Among them, the total output of early rice reached 6,320,000,000 jin, an increase of 114% compared to last year; the total output and average yield per mu of early and mid-season corn increased by 97% compared to last year. Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County achieved a yield of 1,021 jin of early rice per mu; four counties achieved yields of 800 to 1,000 jin per mu, and sixteen counties achieved yields of 600 to 800 jin per mu.

Guangxi's bumper harvest of summer grain this year was achieved under the adverse conditions of prolonged drought. The rainfall in the region from January to July this year decreased by 328 millimeters compared to the same period last year, and the drought-affected area of summer crops reached 11,700,000 mu. However, inspired by the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, and under the correct leadership of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, people of all ethnic groups not only overcame the severe drought but also launched an unprecedented upsurge in water conservancy construction, and carried out a series of major reforms in cultivation techniques focusing on deep plowing, close planting, fertilizer accumulation, and seizing the season to increase production. In the first half of the year, a total of 130,000 water conservancy projects were built in the region, irrigating an area of 12,500,000 mu, with an average of several hundred dan of fertilizer applied per mu. In the late-stage management of summer crops, all localities universally carried out large-scale support, large-scale collaboration, large-scale appraisal, and large-scale inspection, ensuring a bumper harvest.

    广西夏粮增产一倍多
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区今年夏季粮食作物空前丰收。全区早稻和早、中玉米的总产量达八十亿零六千五百万斤，比去年增产110％。其中早稻总产量达六十三亿二千万斤，比去年增产114％；早、中玉米总产量和每亩平均产量比去年增产97％。亩产一千零二十一斤早稻的有三江侗族自治县；有四个县亩产达到八百至一千斤，有十六个县亩产达到六百至八百斤。
    广西今年夏粮的丰收，是在长期干旱的恶劣条件下获得的。全区今年1至7月的降雨量，比去年同期减少三百二十八公厘，夏收作物受旱面积达一千一百七十万亩。但是，在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，在中共广西僮族自治区委员会正确领导下，各族人民不仅战胜了严重旱象，还兴起了空前的兴修水利高潮，并围绕深耕、密植、积肥、抢季节等增产环节，进行了一系列的耕作技术大改革。上半年，全区共兴建了水利工程十三万处，灌溉面积达一千二百五十万亩，平均每亩施肥好几百担。在夏季作物后期管理当中，各地普遍开展了大支援、大协作、大评比、大检查，保证了丰收。
