　　Late Night Performance at the Construction Site
    One night, at the Yuejin Canal construction site, which stretched four or five *li* in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, a propaganda team appeared. This team was composed of the Huaisheng and Hongxing troupes of Shouxian County. The project was initiated under the personal leadership of the local and county Party committees. The vast number of cadres and masses, with their soaring enthusiasm, put forward resounding battle slogans such as "Work hard for three days and nights to excavate 120,000 cubic meters of earth," "Cut through the high ridge and force the water to jump over the ridge," and "Eliminate the drought tiger in seven days and ensure a bumper harvest even without rain for a year." The completion of the project would ensure that 90,000 *mu* of nearby land would be free from flooding and drought. Encouraged by these heroes, the propaganda team unanimously requested to perform on the spot at night, performing programs such as chorus, opera "Observation," and "Hitting Dry Sticks" on the construction site, which was about ten *li* long. The stream of people and cheers and applause resounded throughout the entire Yuejin Canal construction site. The propaganda team did not return to their lodgings until 2:30 in the morning. The next day, they again participated in the labor with great enthusiasm.

　　深夜演出在工地
    一天夜晚，在安徽省寿县的一条四五华里长的跃进渠工地上，出现了一支宣传队，这支宣传队就是寿县淮声、红星两个剧团组成的。工程是在地、县委亲自领导下动工的，广大干部群众以他们的冲天干劲，提出“苦战三昼夜，挖土十二万方”“辟开高岗岭，迫水跳过岗”“七天消灭旱老虎，一年不雨保丰收”等响亮的战斗口号。工程完成，可确保附近九万亩土地不涝不旱。宣传队在这些英雄们的鼓舞下，一致要求夜间就地演出，在约十里长的工地上表演了大合唱、戏曲“观摩”、“打干棒”等节目。一条龙的人流和欢呼鼓掌声，响彻了整个跃进渠的工地。宣传队在深夜二点半才回到住宿地。第二天他们又紧张地参加了劳动。
