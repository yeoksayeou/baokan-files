    Instructions from the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on Vigorously Developing the Copper and Aluminum Industries
    (Issued September 24, 1958)
    Currently, China’s 600 million people are developing industrial and agricultural production with soaring enthusiasm. In the first half of 1958, the growth rate of China's industrial and agricultural production was unprecedented. High yields in agriculture and many technical and economic indicators in industry have continuously created new records. Now, the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production is unfolding magnificently throughout the country.
    However, in the national great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, there is a weak link: the output of copper and aluminum is far from meeting the needs of the machinery manufacturing and electric power industries. If this problem is not well resolved, it will inevitably affect the speed of development of China's socialist construction. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize the entire Party and all the people to work together to launch a campaign to vigorously develop copper and aluminum production, striving to establish thousands of copper and aluminum enterprises in the shortest possible time and vigorously solve this problem.
    In the past, the foundation of China's copper and aluminum industries was very weak, and the output of copper and aluminum was very small. During the First Five-Year Plan, we built some modern copper and aluminum industries, which rapidly increased the output of copper and aluminum. However, to meet the needs of the grand socialist construction plan in 1959, it is necessary to increase the output of copper and aluminum several times compared to this year's output. This development speed is unprecedented in the world, and the task is extremely arduous.
    Is it possible to increase China's copper and aluminum output several times in one year? We believe that we are fully capable of completing this task. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have continuously created miracles that have never existed in the world. To ensure the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production, we must and can create an unprecedented speed of development in the production and construction of the copper and aluminum industries. Relying on the heroic spirit and soaring enthusiasm of the 600 million people, many difficulties in the construction and production of copper and aluminum will be resolved. China is extremely rich in copper and aluminum resources. According to geological data and reports from the masses, many copper and aluminum mines have been discovered in all provinces and autonomous regions of China. With widely distributed resources, it is possible to spread out and build many small, medium, and several large copper and aluminum enterprises. The Chinese people have rich experience in copper smelting. Making good use of this experience will enable us to overcome this difficulty.
    In order to ensure the great leap forward in copper and aluminum production in 1959, in terms of copper production, production should be organized immediately in places where copper mines have already been discovered. In places where no mines have been discovered but mineral resources are estimated to exist, the masses should be immediately organized to report mines, and exploration forces should be organized to conduct prospecting. Because copper mines are widely distributed in China, and indigenous smelting technology has been solved and is constantly being improved, counties, districts, townships, and communes should be universally organized to carry out indigenous mining and smelting in all places where mineral resources exist. This kind of indigenous production, which uses little or no machinery, can flourish everywhere. In the process of indigenous production, semi-mechanization and small-scale mechanization should be gradually realized to improve the recovery rate and increase output. The construction of several large copper mine bases that have been basically explored and have started construction should be accelerated, striving to put them into production ahead of schedule. This approach of combining indigenous and foreign methods, first focusing on indigenous methods, and then transitioning from indigenous to foreign methods, will rapidly increase China's copper output.
    In terms of aluminum production, efforts should be made to actively study economical and simple production methods that use less electricity, so that they can be widely promoted throughout the country. Before new production methods can be widely promoted, all localities should seize the construction of small aluminum plants, so that these aluminum plants can be put into production within two or three months or three or four months, so as to cultivate technical forces and rapidly increase output through these plants.
    The construction and production of copper and aluminum enterprises (especially indigenous copper smelting) require a large amount of labor, especially since copper mines are mostly located in sparsely populated mountainous areas. This requires not only Party committees and governments at all levels to do a good job of organization, leading everyone to go to the mountains and construction sites, but also the broad masses of the people to enthusiastically participate in the construction and production of copper and aluminum enterprises, and to exert creativity in their work to ensure the victorious completion of the construction and production of copper and aluminum enterprises. Communist Youth League organizations at all levels should mobilize young people to respond to the call of the Party and the government, organize shock forces, and carry out shock work on the capital construction and production fronts.
    The construction and production of copper and aluminum enterprises require a large amount of equipment. Equipment manufacturing departments should give priority to manufacturing and ensure timely supply.
    The construction and production of copper and aluminum enterprises also require the cooperation of electricity, transportation, coal and other related departments. The workers and comrades of all these departments should actively support the copper and aluminum industries, strive to increase production, and give priority to meeting their requirements.
    In sparsely populated mountainous areas, where a large amount of manpower is concentrated to mine and build copper mines, the supply of materials must keep up to ensure the supply of various materials and daily necessities.
    Although the tasks of copper and aluminum production and capital construction are very arduous, as long as the Chinese people recognize the importance of this task and rely on the strength of the people, any difficulties can be overcome. Party committees and governments at all levels should immediately take action and grasp the production and capital construction of copper and aluminum in the same way as they grasp agriculture and steel. We believe that as long as this is done, the great leap forward in China's copper and aluminum production can be victoriously realized, thereby ensuring the great leap forward in China's socialist construction.

    中共中央和国务院指示抓住大跃进中薄弱环节
    高速度发展铜铝工业
    动员全民土法冶炼，一年内把产量提高几倍
    新华社24日讯  中共中央、国务院关于大力发展铜、铝工业的指示  （一九五八年九月二十四日发布）
    目前我国六亿人民正在以冲天的干劲发展工农业生产。1958年上半年我国工农业生产的增长速度是空前未有的，农业上的高额丰产和工业上的许多技术经济指标，都不断地创造了新纪录。现在全国工农业的生产大跃进，正在壮阔地展开。
    但是在全国工农业生产大跃进中，有一个薄弱环节，这就是铜和铝的产量远远地不能满足机械制造工业和电力工业的需要。如果这个问题不能得到很好的解决，必将影响我国社会主义建设的发展速度。因此，必须动员全党全民一齐动手，开展一个大搞铜、铝生产的运动，争取在最短的时间内，建立起成千上万的铜、铝企业，大力解决这一问题。
    我国过去铜、铝工业的基础是很薄弱的，铜、铝的产量很小。在第一个五年计划期间，我们虽然建设了一些近代化的铜、铝工业，使铜、铝的产量迅速上升，但是要满足1959年宏伟的社会主义建设计划的需要，就必须把铜、铝的产量提高到几倍于今年的产量。这个发展速度是世界上从来没有的，任务是十分艰巨的。
    有没有可能在一年的时间中，把我国的铜、铝产量提高几倍呢？我们认为完全有条件完成这个任务。我国人民在中国共产党的领导之下，已经不断地创造出了世界上过去没有的奇迹。为了保证我国工业、农业生产的大跃进，我们在铜、铝工业的生产和建设上，也必须而且可能创造出在世界上空前的发展速度。依靠六亿人民的英雄气概和冲天干劲，铜、铝的建设和生产当中的许多困难是都会得到解决的。我国铜、铝资源十分丰富，根据地质资料和群众报矿，我国所有的省和自治区，都发现很多铜矿、铝矿。有了分布很广的资源，就可以遍地开花，建设许多小型、中型和若干大型铜、铝企业。我国人民有丰富的炼铜的经验，很好地利用这些经验，就会使我们突破这一难关。
    为了保证1959年铜、铝生产的大跃进，在铜的生产方面需要在已经发现铜矿的地方，立即组织生产，在尚未发现但是估计可能有矿源的地方，立即组织群众报矿和组织勘探力量进行找矿。因为我国铜矿分布很广，而土法冶炼技术已经解决并且正在不断改进。因此，应当普遍地组织县、区、乡、社，在一切有矿源的地方进行土法开采和冶炼。这种不用或者少用机械的土法生产，可以到处开花。在土法生产的过程中，逐步实现半机械化和小型机械化，以提高回收率，提高产量。对于已经基本探清的资源和已经开工建设的几个大型铜矿基地应当加紧建设，力争提前投入生产。这样土洋并举，首先以土为主，然后由土到洋的作法，将能迅速地提高我国的铜产量。
    在铝的生产方面，应当积极研究少用电力的既经济又简易的生产方法，以便在全国普遍推广。在新的生产方法尚不能普遍推广以前，各地应当抓紧小型铝厂的建设，使这些铝厂在两、三个月或者三、四个月内投入生产，以便通过这些厂子培养技术力量，迅速增加产量。
    在铜、铝企业的建设和生产中（特别是土法炼铜），需要大量的劳动力，特别是铜矿多在人口稀少的山区，这不仅需要各地党委和政府作好组织工作，领导大家上山、上工地，更需要广大人民热烈参加铜、铝企业的建设和生产，并且在工作中发挥创造性，保证铜、铝企业建设和生产的胜利完成。各级共青团组织应当动员青年响应党和政府的号召，组织突击力量，到基本建设和生产战线上，进行突击。
    铜、铝企业的建设和生产，需要大量设备，设备制造部门，应当优先制造，保证按期供应。
    铜、铝企业的建设和生产，还需要电力、交通和煤炭等有关部门的协作。所有这些部门的职工同志，都应当主动支援铜、铝工业，努力增加生产，优先满足它们的要求。
    在人口稀少的山区，集中许多人力开采和建设铜矿，物资供应工作必须跟上去，保证各种材料和生活必需品的供应。
    铜、铝的生产和基本建设任务虽然十分繁重，但是只要我国人民认识了这个任务的重要性，依靠人民力量，任何困难都是可以克服的。各级党委和政府，应当立即动手，像抓农业和钢铁一样抓铜、铝的生产和基本建设工作。我们相信，只要作到这一点，我国铜、铝生产的大跃进一定可以胜利实现，从而使我国社会主义建设的大跃进得到保证。
