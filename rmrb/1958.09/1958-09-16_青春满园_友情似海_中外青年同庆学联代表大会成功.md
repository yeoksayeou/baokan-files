　　Youthful Garden, Friendship Like the Sea
　　Chinese and Foreign Youth Celebrate the Success of the Student Federation Congress
    Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Tonight, youths and students in the capital joined student representatives from various countries in a grand garden party in Zhongshan Park to celebrate the successful conclusion of the International Student Union's Fifth Congress.
    Tonight, Zhongshan Park was completely immersed in an ocean of peace and friendship. Throughout the park, countless light bulbs framed all the antique pavilions, terraces, towers, and halls with brilliant lace, and countless red palace lanterns and colored light bulbs were dotted among the verdant pine forests, competing with the blooming flowers in the garden. Amidst the lights and shadows of the flowers, more than 20,000 youths and students from the capital, along with student representatives and observers from seventy countries around the world, speaking different languages and with different skin colors, joyfully sang and celebrated, jointly wishing for world peace and for greater unity among students around the world.
    At 7:00 PM, as student representatives and observers from the Soviet Union and socialist countries, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other countries successively entered Zhongshan Park and arrived at the Altar of Land and Grain, the youths and students of the capital waiting on both sides of the passage continuously burst into thunderous applause and rhythmically shouted "Long Live Peace," thanking the representatives for their excellent contributions to the cause of world peace and promoting the great unity of students from various countries at the International Student Union's Fifth Congress.
    At 7:30 PM, Wang Zhaohua, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, announced the opening of the garden party. In his speech, Wang Zhaohua said that the youth and students of Beijing are sincerely happy about the achievements of the International Student Union's Fifth Congress. We firmly believe that the spirit of the Congress's resolutions will soon blossom and bear fruit among students of various countries. Next, International Student Union President Baille Ke enthusiastically thanked the youth and students of Beijing for holding such a grand garden party for them. Baille Ke said that the meeting between us is not a meeting between guests and hosts, but a meeting between the best of friends. Although we are far apart, from the first day we arrived in your country, we have felt like we are at home.
    Baille Ke said that the resolution passed by this Congress unanimously expressed unparalleled anger at the war provocations of American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait region. We firmly believe that the Chinese people will surely liberate their territory of Taiwan.
    Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, also spoke. He said that Chinese youth love peace and will always be the most faithful and reliable friends of youth all over the world. The future world belongs to us, let us unite and strive for a better future.
    At 8:10 PM, the entertainment program began. At this time, on the Altar of Land and Grain in the park, in the West Forest, at the Tannamen Gate and Laijinyuxuan and other areas, Peking opera, song and dance, acrobatics, puppet shows, and the gongs and drums and accordions in the dance floor all sounded together, and Zhongshan Park instantly became a moving world of music and dance.
    Everywhere you could see student representatives from all over the world happily singing and dancing together with Chinese youth and students. Holding hands, they sang "The March of the World's Democratic Youth" and danced group dances, the dance circle rolled bigger and bigger, and the singing became louder and louder. When the garden party ended late at night, people were still reluctant to leave, singing "Unity is Strength," and the friendship between student representatives from various countries and Chinese youth and students was completely intertwined.

　　青春满园　友情似海
　　中外青年同庆学联代表大会成功
    据新华社15日讯　今天晚间首都青年和学生同各国学生代表在中山公园一起参加了盛大游园晚会，庆祝国际学联第五届代表大会胜利闭幕。
    今天晚间，中山公园完全沉浸在和平与友谊的海洋里。整个园中，无数的电灯泡为所有的古色古香的亭、榭、楼、阁镶成灿烂的花边，数不清的红色宫灯和彩色灯泡点缀在青翠的松林间，与满园怒放的花朵竞相争艳。在灯下花影间，首都两万多名青年和学生同来自世界各地七十个国家的语言不同、肤色相异的学生代表和观察员，尽情地欢乐歌唱，共同祝愿世界和平，祝愿世界学生进一步大团结。
    七时，当苏联和社会主义国家、亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲等国家的学生代表与观察员陆续进入中山公园，到达社稷坛时，迎候在通道两旁的首都青年和学生不断地发出雷鸣般的掌声，并且有节奏地高呼
  “和平万岁”，感谢代表们在国际学联第五届代表大会上为世界和平事业和促进各国学生的大团结做出了良好的贡献。
    七时半，共青团北京市委第一书记王照华宣布游园大会开始。王照华致词说，我们北京青年和学生对国际学联第五届代表大会所取得的成就衷心地感到高兴。我们深信大会决议的精神，不久将在各国学生中开花结果。接着，国际学联主席贝利康热情地感谢北京市青年和学生为他们举行的盛大游园晚会。贝利康说，我们之间的会见，不是宾主间的会见，而是最好的朋友的会见。虽然我们相隔很远，但是从我们来到你们国家的第一天起就感到像自己家中一样。
    贝利康说，这次代表大会所通过的决议一致对美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区的战争挑衅表示无比愤怒，我们坚信中国人民一定会解放自己的领土台湾。
    共青团中央书记处第一书记胡耀邦也讲了话。他说，中国青年是热爱和平的，永远是全世界青年的最忠实最可靠的朋友。未来的世界是我们的，让我们团结起来为美好的未来而奋斗。
    八时十分游艺节目开始，这时在公园的社稷坛上，在西树林，在坛南门和来今雨轩等地区，京剧、歌舞、杂技、木偶演出团和舞池里的锣鼓和手风琴一齐响开了，中山公园立时变成了一个动人的音乐和舞蹈的世界。
    到处可以看到来自世界各国的学生代表同中国青年和学生们在一起欢乐歌舞。他们手挽着手，一面高唱“世界民主青年进行曲”，一面跳着集体舞，舞圈越卷越大，歌声也越唱越响亮。当游园晚会在深夜结束时，人们还依依不舍地高唱着“团结就是力量”的歌子，各国的学生代表和中国的青年和学生们的友谊情感完全交融在一起。
