    New Uses for Sweet Potatoes
    Good Raw Material for Explosives
    Hu Qingzhao

    Alcohol has a very wide range of uses in industry. In the past, it was thought that it was a distant matter for our country to use agricultural products as industrial raw materials on a large scale. Now we must change this concept, because only a fraction of the sweet potato production can be used to produce many industrial products.

    Using sweet potatoes to make alcohol, the alcohol can be further processed into ethylene glycol. It is a very useful industrial raw material, and like glycerol (propanetriol), it can be nitrated to make explosives, which are widely used in iron mines, coal mines, non-ferrous metal mines, building reservoirs, and road construction projects. The commonly known nitroglycerin explosive has a drawback, which is that it freezes in winter and loses its sensitivity. Eight or nine out of ten accidents involving nitroglycerin explosives in winter are caused by this reason. However, using dinitroethylene glycol explosive has the following advantages:

    1.  When mixed with nitroglycerin, it does not easily solidify even at minus twenty to thirty degrees Celsius, making it an excellent non-freezing explosive. The climate in Northeast and North China is cold in winter, and various mines and engineering projects require this type of explosive.

    2.  Its stability against impact, friction, and heat is better than that of nitroglycerin. Its explosive power is the same as that of nitroglycerin.

    3.  The current production of glycerol is not sufficient, so it is necessary to use the abundant ethylene glycol to make explosives.

    During the Second Five-Year Plan, our country will mine tens of millions of tons of iron ore, hundreds of millions of tons of coal, and hundreds of millions of tons of non-ferrous metal ore each year, requiring millions of tons of mining explosives. Ethylene glycol explosives need to be produced in all regions.

    The auxiliary raw materials required for the production of ethylene glycol are not many. It is easy to obtain ethylene from alcohol, and ethylene can be made into ethylene oxide in two ways. One is to synthesize ethylene chlorohydrin using chlorine and ethylene, and then decompose it into ethylene oxide; the other, newer method is to directly oxidize ethylene with air using an aluminum catalyst to form ethylene oxide. Both methods yield ethylene oxide which can be absorbed with water or dilute sulfuric acid to make ethylene glycol.

    Both of these methods have already been used to design small workshops with an annual output of fifty tons, which can be adopted by various regions according to local conditions. However, the new direct oxidation method does not use chlorine auxiliary raw materials and also eliminates the process of manufacturing ethylene chlorohydrin, which is simpler in terms of production steps. Therefore, direct oxidation can be used more to produce ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol. The Beijing Institute of Chemical Research is about to carry out expanded experiments to prepare conditions for widespread production in various regions.

    In addition to making explosives, ethylene glycol has many other uses, and the usage is also very large, which will not be introduced here.

    甘薯新用途
    炸药的好原料
    胡庆昭
    酒精在工业上有着非常广泛的用途。过去认为我国要大量用农产品作工业原料还是很远的事，现在要改变这种观念了，因为仅仅用几分之一的红薯产量就能制出许多工业产品。
    用红薯做酒精，酒精再加工就可以成乙二醇。它是很有用的工业原料，和甘油（丙三醇）一样硝化后可以做成炸药，广泛使用于铁矿、煤矿、有色金属矿、建筑水库和修路等工程方面。一般所熟悉的硝化甘油炸药有一个缺点，就是在冬季会冻结，失去灵敏性，冬季使用硝化甘油炸药发生的事故十之八九都是由这个原因造成的。但是采用二硝基乙二醇炸药就有以下几个好处：
    1、它和硝化甘油混合使用，即使在零下二十——三十度也不容易凝固，是一种极好的不冻炸药。我国东北、华北地区冬季气候寒冷，各个矿山和各种工程的爆破就需要使用这种炸药。
    2、它受撞击、磨擦、受热后的安定性都比硝化甘油好。爆炸能力与硝化甘油一样。
    3、甘油目前的产量是不够多的，必须利用资源丰富的乙二醇来做炸药。
    我国在第二个五年计划内每年要开采几千万吨铁矿，几亿吨煤矿，成亿吨的有色金属矿，需要上百万吨的矿山炸药，乙二醇炸药各地区都需要安排生产。
    生产乙二醇所要的辅助原料不多。用酒精很容易得到乙烯，乙烯有两个方法可以做成环氧乙烷。一个是用氯气与乙烯化合成氯乙醇，再分解成环氧乙烷；另一个更新的方法是乙烯与空气通过铝触媒直接氧化成环氧乙烷，两种方法得出的环氧乙烷都可以用水或稀的硫酸吸收后做成乙二醇。
    这两种方法目前都已经作出年产五十吨小型车间的设计，各个地区可以因地制宜加以采用。但是新式的直接氧化法可以不使用氯气辅助原料，也省略掉制造氯乙醇的工序，在生产步骤上是较简单的，因此可以多采用直接氧化的办法来生产环氧乙烷和乙二醇。北京化工研究院即将作出扩大试验，为各地普遍生产准备条件。
    乙二醇除了做炸药以外还有很多的用途，用量也非常大，不在这里介绍。
