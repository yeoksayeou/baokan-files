　　Talking About Squares on the Eve of National Day
　　Shi Genyuan

　　National Day is coming soon. The hearts of the people of Beijing and the people of the whole country will fly to the solemn and magnificent Tiananmen Square.

　　The development of squares also has its own history with the changes of society.

　　As early as the 5th to 4th centuries BC, squares had already appeared in the urban construction of ancient Greece. These places were used for gatherings, trading, and gymnastics. In the city of Miletus in Asia Minor, the square north and south gathering places and the square in front of the city hall can be regarded as the earliest regular squares in ancient Greece. By the 4th to 1st centuries BC, arcades for residents to rest were added to the square.

　　In feudal society, city squares served the monarchs and religious ruling classes of the time. In some ancient cities in our country, the imperial palace was often the core, forming a central axis, on which were arranged halls, sleeping halls, palace gates, buildings, memorial arches, and squares, as places for national ceremonies, court congratulations, and sacrifices.

　　In the cities of capitalist society, although frequent traffic and people's lives urgently need perfect streets and squares, due to the private ownership of land and the nature of capitalists pursuing high profits, capitalists often drastically reduce the open areas and park green areas in cities in order to build profitable buildings. On the other hand, with the growth of the working class, the city has become the center of the proletarian revolutionary struggle, and large-scale mass movements and peace movements have made full use of the limited streets and squares in the city to hold rallies, parades, and demonstrations.

　　In the era of my country's semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movements such as the "May Fourth" and "December 9th" movements, the squares in the cities—Tiananmen Square in Beijing, Democracy Square in Sand Beach, etc.—became places for patriotic masses to gather and demonstrate.

　　In socialist society, squares have played an even greater role, becoming important places in people's political, economic, and cultural life.

　　The planning and construction of squares can be divided into several types according to their uses:

　　City center squares are used for city residents to stroll, sightsee, and for urban traffic on weekdays. During festivals and major events, people gather, parade, and hold military parades here.

　　The square in front of public buildings is for the rapid evacuation of people. Statues, fountains, flower beds, etc. can be set up in the square to form a beautiful environment together with the building.

　　The station square refers to the square in front of the railway, bus, shipping, maritime, aviation, or several combined transportation stations, which must solve the traffic problems of a large number of passenger and freight transportation. Public buildings related to the business of transportation hub stations and serving passengers should be built around the square.

　　In addition to the above public squares, traffic squares generally include bridgehead squares, intersection squares, and squares at the intersection of several main roads. Various means of transportation must converge in the square, and at the same time, they must be able to pass quickly here.

### 国庆前夕话广场

    国庆前夕话广场
    史根源
    国庆节就快来到了。北京人民和全国人民的心，都将飞向庄严、壮丽的天安门广场。
    广场的发展，也是随着社会的变化有着它自己的一段历史。
    早在公元前五世纪到四世纪，古希腊的城市建设中就已经出现了广场。这些场所是供集会、交易和做体操用的。在小亚细亚的米列特城中，方形的南、北集会广场和市政厅前的广场，要算是古希腊最早的规则形广场。到了公元前四至一世纪，广场上增加了居民休息用的长廊。
    到了封建社会，城市广场是为当时君主、宗教统治阶级服务的。我国古代的一些城市中，常以皇宫为核心，形成一根中轴线，在中轴线上布置大殿、寝堂、宫门、楼、牌坊和广场，作为国家大典、朝贺、祭祀的地点。
    资本主义社会的城市里，虽然频繁的交通和人民生活上都迫切需要完善的街道和广场，但由于土地私有制及资本家追求高额利润的本质，资本家为了建筑有利可图的建筑物，常常急剧缩小着城市中的空旷地区和公园绿化地区。另一方面，随着工人阶级的成长，城市成为无产阶级革命斗争的中心，大规模的群众运动与和平运动，又充分利用了城市中有限的街道和广场，来进行集会、游行与示威。
    在我国半封建半殖民地社会的时代里，反帝反封建的“五四”、“一二·九”等革命运动中，城市中的广场——北京的天安门广场、沙滩民主广场等，都成为爱国群众集会示威的场所。
    到了社会主义社会，广场才更大地发挥了它的作用，成为人民政治、经济、文化生活中重要的地方。
    广场的规划与修建，可按其用途分成好几种：
    市中心广场，是平日城市居民散步、游览和城市交通用的。到了节日和举行重大活动时，要在这里集会、游行和阅兵。
    公共建筑物前的广场，是为了迅速疏散人流。在广场里可以设置雕像、喷水池、花坛等，使与建筑物一起形成一个优美的环境。
    站前广场，是指火车、汽车、航运、海运、航空或几种交通联运站前的广场，它要解决大量客运、货运的交通问题。广场的四周应该建筑同交通枢纽站业务有关的以及为旅客服务的公共建筑物。
    除了上面的公共广场外，交通广场一般有桥头广场、十字路口的广场、数条干道交叉处的广场，各种交通工具要在广场里汇合，同时又要能够迅速地在这里通行。
