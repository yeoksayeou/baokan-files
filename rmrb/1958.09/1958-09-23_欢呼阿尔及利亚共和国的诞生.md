    Hail the Birth of the Republic of Algeria

    Good news of national independence movements keeps coming! More than two months ago, a thunderclap resounded in Baghdad, and all freedom- and peace-loving people around the world excitedly hailed the birth of the Republic of Iraq. Now, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria has announced its establishment on September 19th. The birth of the Republic of Algeria is a milestone on the road to victory for the Algerian national independence movement, marking a new stage in the Algerian people's struggle for national independence. We, the Chinese people, extend our heartfelt congratulations and respect to the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria and to the Algerian people who are fighting heroically for their national independence in distant North Africa.
    Since November 1, 1954, when three thousand Algerian guerrillas raised the torch of rebellion in the Aurès Mountains, the armed struggle against French colonial rule has become a prairie fire throughout Algeria. For nearly four years, the French government has carried out brutal suppression of the Algerian people. Six hundred thousand French colonial troops and two hundred thousand French military police, equipped with modern weapons, not only fought the Algerian rebel forces on the battlefield, but also carried out bloody massacres of unarmed Algerian civilians. However, the Algerian people, who have awakened and are determined to fight for their freedom, cannot be subdued by any violence. The Algerian people's liberation movement continues to develop. The Algerian people's armed forces have grown stronger and stronger in the course of fighting an enemy that is superior in numbers and weapons, and have now become a national liberation army with 150,000 soldiers. Algerian rebel forces have taken control of more than two-thirds of the country; and have established regimes in many areas. It is on this basis of victory that the Algerian people have been able to solemnly declare to the world the birth of the Republic of Algeria and the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria.
    The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria is a heavy blow to the French colonialists at a time when de Gaulle is playing the trick of holding a "referendum" on his draft "constitution." De Gaulle's purpose in carrying out the "constitutional" reform is, on the one hand, to suppress democratic forces at home and establish a military dictatorship; on the other hand, he hopes to obstruct the development of the national independence struggle of the colonial people and maintain the crumbling French colonial empire. In de Gaulle's new "constitution," Algeria is "stipulated" to be "forever French territory," and the Algerian people are "stipulated" to be "full French citizens." This is a draft "constitution" for annexing Algeria. De Gaulle attempts to use bayonets to force the Algerian people to participate in the "referendum" and accept this "constitution." However, de Gaulle's conspiracy has been resolutely opposed by the Algerian people. The proclamation of the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria has demonstrated with action their determination to carry the fight to the end for national independence. The French colonialists could not save the collapse of their colonial rule in Algeria in the past with military suppression, so now they will never be able to stop the Algerian people from moving towards victory with political trickery.
    Just as the victory of the Iraqi revolution changed the face of the Middle East, the birth of the Republic of Algeria will have a tremendous impact on the national independence movement of the African people. The Algerian people's armed struggle against French colonial rule has been a powerful inspiration to the African people who are still living under the yoke of colonialism. Currently, the whole of Africa is awakening, especially in French Africa, de Gaulle's conspiracy to peddle a colonialist "constitution" has not had the effect of curbing the African people's demand for independence as he had expected; on the contrary, the facts have gone against de Gaulle's wishes. French Guinea, Niger and other regions have decided to secede from France and become independent. Of course, the French colonialists will never be willing to withdraw from these areas. The fact that the Algerian people have created their own country through heroic struggle is undoubtedly a glorious example for the people of Guinea, the people of Niger, and all African people who demand national independence, making them understand how to deal with the bloody suppression of the colonialists and realize their desire for independence.
    It is precisely because of this that the birth of the Republic of Algeria has not only made the French colonialists furious, but has also caused panic among all other colonial countries. The French government clamors for other countries to refuse to recognize the Republic of Algeria, and even threatens to sever diplomatic relations. The British government followed suit with a statement that it has "no intention of recognizing" the Algerian Provisional Government. The U.S. State Department also quickly expressed its "disappointment" at the birth of the Republic of Algeria, saying that the United States had "no reason" to recognize this government. Let these colonialist overlords cling to their ostrich policy of "non-recognition"! This is nothing but a desperate wail in the face of the surging tide of the national independence movement. The Chinese people have had ample experience with this kind of "non-recognition" policy. The People's Republic of China has been established for nine years, and the United States and some of its partners have been closing their eyes and unwilling to "recognize" it. The U.S. State Department even recently issued a memorandum listing the reasons for "non-recognition" of China, but what loss has this caused to the Chinese people? None whatsoever. The Chinese people are advancing at an astonishing pace on the road to building socialism. And it is precisely the United States itself that has been ridiculed by all fair world opinion for adopting such a policy. The situation is the same for the Republic of Algeria. The "non-recognition" policy of France and its colonial partners cannot stop the Algerian people from advancing on the road to victory.
    Not only that, but the attitude taken by the colonial countries towards the Republic of Algeria helps the Algerian people to further distinguish who are their friends and who are their enemies. In the past, the United States had long played a double game in front of the Algerian people. On the one hand, it provided munitions to help the French colonial troops massacre the Algerian people, and on the other hand, it often talked about its "friendship" with the Algerian people. Now, this hypocritical face can no longer be concealed. The Algerian people will see clearly that the American colonialists and the French colonialists, although they also have conflicting interests with each other, are unwavering in their resolute opposition to the national independence movement.
    How pitiful and powerless does the colonial countries' clamor of "non-recognition" of the Republic of Algeria appear, compared with the cheers for the birth of the Republic of Algeria from every corner of the world! The vast Asian and African countries and the progressive forces of the world are excited and encouraged by this glorious victory of the Algerian people. As soon as the Republic of Algeria was established, it received recognition and congratulations from many countries. This situation shows that although France, the United States and some other colonial countries have adopted a hostile attitude towards the Republic of Algeria, the Algerian people have friends all over the world!
    The Chinese people have genuine sympathy for all struggles against colonialism and for national independence. The Algerian people's struggle for national independence has always been deeply concerned by the Chinese people. On the "Day of Solidarity with Algeria" on March 30 this year, the Chinese people expressed their friendship with the Algerian people through action. The Chinese government's decision to recognize the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria once again demonstrates the Chinese people's sympathy and support for the Algerian people and for all people who are fighting for national independence. The Chinese people firmly believe that under the leadership of the Provisional Government, the Algerian people will continue to advance on the road to national independence and will surely smash the French colonialists' military suppression and political conspiracies and achieve complete victory. In his congratulatory telegram to Algerian Provisional Government Prime Minister Abbas, Chairman Mao Zedong "congratulated the Algerian people on achieving more brilliant and greater victories in the struggle for independence and against colonialism." This is the sincere wish of 600 million Chinese people.

### 欢呼阿尔及利亚共和国的诞生

    欢呼阿尔及利亚共和国的诞生
    民族独立运动的喜讯一个接着一个传来！两个多月以前，巴格达响起一声春雷，全世界一切爱好自由和和平的人民以激动的心情欢呼了伊拉克共和国的诞生。现在，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府又于9月19日宣布成立了。阿尔及利亚共和国的诞生，是阿尔及利亚民族独立运动走向胜利的道路上的一个里程碑，标志着阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的斗争已经进入了一个新的阶段。我们中国人民谨向阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府，向正在遥远的北非为自己民族独立而英勇斗争的阿尔及利亚人民，致以衷心的祝贺和敬意。
    自从1954年11月1日阿尔及利亚的三千名游击队员在奥雷斯山区举起了起义的火炬以来，反对法国殖民统治的武装斗争在整个阿尔及利亚成为燎原的烈火。在将近四年的时间里，法国政府对阿尔及利亚人民进行了残酷的镇压。由现代化武器装备起来的六十万法国殖民军队和二十万法国宪警，不但在战场上和阿尔及利亚起义部队作战，而且还对手无寸铁的阿尔及利亚和平居民进行血腥的屠杀。但是，已经觉醒而且决心为争取自己的自由而进行斗争的阿尔及利亚人民，是任何暴力所压不倒的。阿尔及利亚人民的解放运动，仍然继续向前发展。阿尔及利亚人民的武装队伍在对人数武器都占优势的敌人作战过程中力量越来越壮大，目前已经成为拥有十五万战士的一支民族解放军。阿尔及利亚起义部队已经控制了全境的三分之二以上的土地；在不少地区已经建立起政权。正是在这种胜利的基础上，阿尔及利亚人民才能够向全世界庄严地宣告阿尔及利亚共和国的诞生和阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立。
    正在戴高乐玩弄就他的“宪法”草案举行“公民投票”的骗局的时候，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立，对于法国殖民主义者来说是当头一棒。戴高乐搞“宪法”改革的目的，一方面是要在国内镇压民主力量，建立军事独裁统治；另一方面是希望阻挠殖民地人民民族独立斗争的发展，维持正在土崩瓦解中的法兰西殖民帝国。在戴高乐的新“宪法”里，阿尔及利亚被“规定”为“永远是法国的领土”，阿尔及利亚人民被“规定”为“十足的法国公民”。这是一个吞并阿尔及利亚的“宪法”草案。戴高乐企图用刺刀来迫使阿尔及利亚人民参加“公民投票”，接受这个“宪法”。但是，戴高乐的阴谋遭到阿尔及利亚人民的坚决反对。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的宣告成立
  已经用行动表明了他们为争取民族独立而把战斗进行到底的决心。法国殖民主义者过去用军事镇压不能挽救它在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治的崩溃，那末现在用政治骗局也决不能阻挡阿尔及利亚人民走向胜利。
    如同伊拉克革命的胜利改变了中东的面貌一样，阿尔及利亚共和国的诞生对于非洲人民的民族独立运动也将有巨大的影响。阿尔及利亚人民反对法国殖民统治的武装斗争，对于还生活在殖民主义枷锁下的非洲人民一直是有力的鼓舞。目前，整个非洲正在觉醒中，特别是在法国的非洲属地，戴高乐贩卖殖民主义“宪法”的阴谋并没有像他所预期的那样起遏制非洲人民独立要求的作用；恰恰相反，事实却走到了戴高乐愿望的反面。法属几内亚、尼日尔和其它一些地区已经决定要脱离法国而独立。当然，法国殖民主义者是决不会甘心退出这些地区的。阿尔及利亚人民用英勇的战斗缔造了自己的国家这个事实，对于几内亚人民、尼日尔人民以及所有一切要求民族独立的非洲人民毫无疑问是一个光辉的榜样，使他们懂得怎样对付殖民主义者的血腥镇压，实现自己的独立愿望。
    正是由于这样，阿尔及利亚共和国的诞生，不但使得法国殖民主义者暴跳如雷，而且也引起了其它所有殖民主义国家的惊慌。法国政府吵嚷着要别的国家拒绝承认阿尔及利亚共和国，甚至拿出断绝外交关系作为恫吓手段。英国政府跟着声明“无意承认”阿尔及利亚临时政府。美国国务院也很快表示对阿尔及利亚共和国的诞生感到“失望”，说是美国“没有理由”要承认这个政府。让这些殖民主义的老爷们固执他们的“不承认”的鸵鸟政策吧！这不过是他们面对着汹涌澎湃的民族独立运动的洪流所发出的一种绝望的哀鸣而已。对于这种“不承认”政策，中国人民已经有了充分的经验。中华人民共和国成立已经九年了，美国和它的一些伙伴们一直闭起眼睛不愿意“承认”，美国国务院甚至在最近还发表了备忘录来列举“不承认”中国的理由，但是，这对于中国人民有什么损失呢？丝毫没有。中国人民在建设社会主义的道路上以惊人的步伐前进着。而恰恰是美国自己，倒由于采取这种政策而被所有公正的世界舆论所嘲骂。对于阿尔及利亚共和国，情况也是一样。法国和它的殖民伙伴的“不承认”政策阻挡不了阿尔及利亚人民在胜利道路上的前进步伐。
    不但如此，殖民国家对于阿尔及利亚共和国所采取的态度，倒有助于阿尔及利亚人民进一步鉴别谁是他们的朋友，谁是他们的敌人。在过去，美国长期来在阿尔及利亚人民面前耍两面手法。它一面提供军火来帮助法国殖民军队屠杀阿尔及利亚人民，一面又经常在口头上大谈其对阿尔及利亚人民的“友谊”。现在，这种伪善的面目已经再也掩盖不住了。阿尔及利亚人民会看得明明白白，美国殖民主义者和法国殖民主义者尽管相互也有利害的冲突，但是在坚决反对民族独立运动这一点上是毫无差别的。
    殖民主义国家这种“不承认”阿尔及利亚共和国的叫嚣，和为阿尔及利亚共和国的诞生而从世界各个角落发出的欢呼声比较起来，显得多么可怜和无力啊！广大的亚非国家和全世界的进步力量，都对阿尔及利亚人民的这个辉煌胜利而感到兴奋和鼓舞。阿尔及利亚共和国一经成立，就得到了很多国家的承认和祝贺。这种情况表明，尽管法国、美国和其它一些殖民主义国家对阿尔及利亚共和国采取敌视的态度，但是阿尔及利亚人民的朋友遍于全世界！
    中国人民对于一切反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争都怀着真挚的同情。阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的斗争，一直得到中国人民深切的关怀。在今年3月30日“声援阿尔及利亚日”，中国人民用行动表达了自己对阿尔及利亚人民的友谊。中国政府决定承认阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府，再一次表现了中国人民对于阿尔及利亚人民和对于一切为争取民族独立而斗争的人民的同情和支持。中国人民深信，阿尔及利亚人民在临时政府的领导下，一定会在争取民族独立的道路上不断前进，一定会粉碎法国殖民主义者的军事镇压和政治阴谋而取得完全的胜利。毛泽东主席在给阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯的贺电中，“祝贺阿尔及利亚人民在争取独立和反对殖民主义斗争中取得更加辉煌的更加伟大的胜利”。这是六亿中国人民真挚的心愿。
