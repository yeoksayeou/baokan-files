    In the high tide of this year's all-round great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the broad masses of people, full of revolutionary vigor, have launched a massive greening upsurge across the country from south to north. As of August, a total of more than 370 million mu of forest has been planted nationwide, in addition to more than 13.7 billion trees planted around houses, villages, roads, and waterways. Once these newly planted young forests all mature, China's forest cover will increase by about 2.5%. The scale and speed of afforestation are unprecedented in history, both at home and abroad. But this is just the beginning. The new situation of the great leap forward in socialist construction and the rapid establishment of people's communes in various places has put forward new and more gigantic tasks for the greening cause.
    In its instructions on large-scale afforestation issued this spring, the Central Committee proposed to double China's forest area within ten years and increase the timber reserves to about 8 billion cubic meters within fifteen years. According to the preliminary discussions at the National Forestry Department Heads Conference in June this year, it is planned to plant 1.8 billion mu of forest in large areas during the Second Five-Year Plan period and plant 130 billion trees around houses, villages, roads, and waterways, and strive to complete this task three years ahead of schedule through hard work. From this, it seems that this year's afforestation must complete more than 500 million mu, and the next two years must each plant 600 million mu or more, in order to successfully complete the above indicators. Why is it necessary to complete such a large afforestation task in such a short period of time? This is because: In the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year, the demand for timber in all aspects has surged. This year's timber production has increased by 10 million cubic meters compared to last year, and it must continue to increase in the future. According to the forestry department's estimates, timber production in 1962 must be several times higher than this year's in order to guarantee supply; after 1962, it must continue to grow. In order to ensure the continuous expanded reproduction of timber, it is necessary to continuously expand forest resources.
    In the great cause of changing China's natural landscape, forests play an important role. Many provinces and regions in inland China have a lot of barren mountains and wasteland. Only by greening these barren mountains and wasteland as soon as possible can we maintain soil and water and reduce natural disasters. China also has about 1.3 billion mu of large-scale deserts, which endanger the production and life of the broad masses of people in Northwest China, Inner Mongolia, and the western part of Northeast China. Measures must be taken to basically green these deserts in the next few years.
    Due to the people's rectification campaign, the implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and the encouragement of the great agricultural harvest, the communist consciousness of the broad masses of people has been significantly improved, and their fighting spirit is high. While striving for a greater leap forward in industry and agriculture, they also enthusiastically demand more tree planting and afforestation. People not only want forests to provide more material resources for people's production and life, but also want forests to serve the promotion of people's health and the beautification of the living environment, so that the countryside can further develop in the direction of landscaping on the basis of greening. It should be seen that China's greening cause has far-reaching significance. We must carry out afforestation on a large scale, so that barren mountains and wasteland are covered with green shade, deserts are turned into oases, and even the "frontier" must be turned into a place with towering trees, red flowers and green leaves, and evergreen throughout the four seasons. In this way, after a not too long period of time, the people in China's urban and rural areas will live in a large garden with abundant products and beautiful scenery. Therefore, the greening and afforestation cause must be carried out in a big way, both speeding up and improving quality.
    It should be especially pointed out here that in the greening upsurge in the first half of this year, many advanced areas have emerged across the country; however, some areas have made little progress, and some counties have planted only a few thousand mu of forest. These backward areas must also be full of vigor, fight hard in the autumn and winter afforestation, catch up with the advanced, and ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill this year's afforestation task. Of course, advanced areas should not be complacent and slack, but should press forward in victory and create greater victories. Because the yield per unit area of ​​grain can be continuously and substantially increased, after a further increase in grain production, it is possible to squeeze out part of the cultivated land for afforestation. Therefore, in places with more land and fewer people, and in places where the yield per unit area of ​​grain has reached 2,000 catties, consideration should be given to using one-third of the cultivated land for afforestation, so that these places can be the first to achieve landscaping and become new timber production bases.
    Now, the autumn afforestation season has arrived. This autumn and winter, the national afforestation tasks are: large-scale afforestation of more than 150 million mu, planting trees around houses, villages, roads, and waterways to double the number in the first half of the year, collecting 1.6 billion catties of seeds; the replanting and thickening work on newly afforested land should also be completed together, to achieve "not a single tree is missing, not a single mu is less". In addition, preparations should be made for afforestation next year and in the future in terms of seedlings and greening planning.
    Can the afforestation in the second half of the year continue to advance at the same speed as in the first half of the year? The answer is yes. There are seven provinces with more than 20 million mu of afforestation in the first half of the year, fourteen counties with more than 1 million mu of afforestation, and thirty-six counties with 500,000 to 1 million mu of afforestation. Experience has also proved that agriculture and forestry can leap forward at the same time. Anhui Province, one of the provinces with 1,000 catties of early rice, completed 5.8 billion cubic meters of water conservancy projects last winter and this spring, and also afforested more than 30 million mu in the first half of the year. Qiandongnan Autonomous Prefecture in Guizhou Province, with a population of 1.8 million, after completing the task of building 1.1 million mu of new water conservancy projects, fought hard for 70 days in the first half of the year, using 70 million labor days, and afforested 11 million mu, basically completing the afforestation task of the entire prefecture. After the great leap forward in afforestation in the first half of the year, all localities have gained rich experience in ideology, organization, and afforestation technology. At present, the rapid establishment of people's communes provides a more powerful guarantee for large-scale afforestation in the future. The seed setting situation of trees this year is good, and it is a bumper year; due to the intensive seedling cultivation work since the spring, a large batch of seedlings that can be planted in autumn and winter has been prepared. All of these are more favorable and important conditions than in the first half of the year. As long as we strengthen leadership, the task in the second half of the year will definitely be overfulfilled.
    At present, seed collection work is underway across the country. Autumn afforestation has also begun in Gansu, Liaoning, Hebei, Shaanxi and other provinces. Other provinces and regions are also carrying out planning and deployment. However, turning the plan into reality requires a lot of effort. In order to ensure the completion of the task, all localities should make specific arrangements according to the different conditions of local tasks, seasons, and forest land.
    The most fundamental experience we have gained since the Great Leap Forward is that afforestation work must put politics in command, strengthen the leadership of the Party, and fully mobilize the masses. Large-scale afforestation work is no exception. The experience of afforestation in various places in the first half of the year proves that where the leadership grasps tightly, the enthusiasm of the masses is high and the results are great. Therefore, while grasping the central tasks of industry and agriculture, the Party committees in all localities should arrange a certain amount of energy and time to grasp the afforestation work firmly. At present, there are various right-leaning conservative ideas in the afforestation work. For example, some people think that there are many agricultural production tasks, and afforestation can be done on a small scale, less, or slowly. These comrades do not understand that the afforestation cause is one of the important components of our country's socialist construction, and we must be full of vigor, strive for the upstream, and advance at high speed like other construction undertakings. Some people think that there is little suitable land for afforestation in the plains, and there is nothing to do. This view is also incorrect. Lingbi County in Anhui Province completed planting trees on the only 100,000 mu of mountainous land in the county in the first half of the year, and also completed planting more than 2.5 billion trees around houses, villages, roads, and waterways, with an average of more than 3,000 trees planted per person in the county. It can be seen that the potential for planting trees around houses, villages, roads, and waterways in the plains is not small, but very large. With the high-yield agricultural production and the development of transportation and water conservancy construction, new suitable afforestation areas are constantly emerging, and afforestation work must keep up closely. In some areas, some people think that greening has reached its peak. In fact, this is not the case. Take the 367 counties across the country that completed the afforestation task of barren mountains and wasteland in their respective regions in the first half of this year as an example. It is only the first step to complete greening; the tasks of replanting, thickening, and tending young forests are still very heavy. At the same time, in order to develop in the direction of landscaping, it is necessary to continuously develop forestry. In a few areas, some people have seen that this year's drought has caused some of the newly planted young forests to die, or that the existing barren mountains and wasteland are mostly places where tree growth conditions are more difficult, and they believe that the masses' enthusiasm for afforestation will no longer be so high. Obviously, this is a manifestation of insufficient understanding of the masses' awareness and strength. Under the encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the masses' enthusiasm is endless. Trees are planted alive by people. If they die once, they will be planted again for the second time until they are planted alive. No matter how difficult the forest land conditions are, the people will overcome these difficulties. Isn't this the result of doing so in some already green areas? The facts that Qidong County in Hunan Province afforested stone mountains, and Minqin County in Gansu Province built a green Great Wall in the rolling desert are the most eloquent proofs.
    In autumn and winter, in addition to engaging in industry in a big way, the vast rural areas also have to engage in central tasks such as deep plowing of land and building water conservancy projects. The tasks are arduous and the labor force is indeed tight. But even so, the labor problem required for afforestation is not unsolvable. In this regard, a successful experience has been gained in the first half of the year, which is that the Party committee unifies planning and comprehensive arrangements. In terms of manpower, we must combine professional afforestation teams with the widespread mobilization of labor; in terms of time, we advocate small-scale work during busy farming seasons and large-scale work during slack farming seasons, combining year-round preparation (small-scale work) with short-term shock (large-scale work); in terms of regions, we must take a broad view and use the method of organizing mountain and river cooperation to help sparsely populated remote areas complete afforestation tasks; in the arrangement of various tasks, we must be good at combining afforestation work with central work, or interspersing it in the gaps in central work. In the entire autumn and winter afforestation movement, everyone must not only implement the spirit of planting in every season and every day, but also organize several short-term afforestation upsurges rhythmically. Our great cause of greening the motherland is to advance in this way.

### 乘胜前进掀起秋冬季造林高潮

    乘胜前进掀起秋冬季造林高潮
    在今年工农业生产全面大跃进的高潮里，广大人民鼓足革命干劲，全国从南到北掀起了声势浩大的绿化高潮。截至8月止，全国共造林三亿七千多万亩，另外在四旁植树一百三十七亿多株。这三亿多亩新造的幼林全部成林以后，我国的森林复盖率将增加2.5％左右。造林规模之大，速度之快，为古今中外所未有。但这只是个开始。社会主义建设大跃进和各地迅速建立人民公社的新形势，给绿化事业又提出了新的更为巨大的任务。
    中央在今春发布的关于大规模造林的指示中提出，要在十年内使我国森林面积翻一番，木材蓄积量在十五年内增加到八十亿立方公尺左右。据今年6月全国林业厅局长会议初步讨论，拟在第二个五年计划期间大片造林十八亿亩，在四旁植树一千三百亿株，并争取苦干三年，提前完成这个任务。这样看来，今年造林必须完成五亿亩以上，明后年再各造六亿亩或者更多一些，才能胜利完成上述指标。为什么要在短短的时期内完成这么大的造林任务呢？这是因为：在今年工农业生产大跃进中，各方面对木材的需要量激增，今年木材生产量已比去年增加一千万立方公尺，而以后还必须不断地增加。根据林业部门推算，1962年的木材生产量必须比今年再增加几倍，才能保证供应；1962年以后，还须继续增长。为了保证木材的不断扩大再生产，必须不断地扩大森林资源。
    在改变我国自然面貌的伟大事业中，森林起着重要的作用。我国内地各省区，有不少荒山荒地，只有把这些荒山荒地尽快地绿化，才能保持水土，减免自然灾害。我国还有约十三亿亩的大面积的沙漠，危害着西北、内蒙古和东北地区西部等广大人民的生产和生活，必须采取措施，争取在最近若干年内基本上绿化这些沙漠。
    由于全民整风、党的社会主义建设总路线的贯彻执行和农业大丰收的鼓舞，广大人民的共产主义觉悟显著提高，斗志昂扬。他们在争取工农业更大跃进的同时，也热烈地要求更多地植树造林。人民不仅要叫森林为人民的生产生活提供更多的物质资料，还要叫森林为促进人民健康和美化生活环境服务，使农村在绿化的基础上进一步向园林化的方向发展。应该看到，我国的绿化事业，具有深远的意义。我们一定要大规模地造林，让荒山、荒地绿荫复地，叫沙漠变成绿洲，就是边疆“塞外”也要使它变成树木参天、花红叶绿、四季常青的地方。这样，经过不太长的岁月，我国城乡人民就将生活在物产丰饶、风光绮丽的大花园里。因此，绿化造林事业必须大搞特搞，既要加快速度，又要提高质量。
    这里特别要指出，今年上半年的绿化高潮中，全国涌现了不少先进的地区；但是也有些地区进展不大，有些县造林仅仅几千亩。这些落后地区更必须鼓足干劲，在秋冬季造林中大干一场，赶上先进，保证完成并争取超额完成今年的造林任务。当然，先进地区也不能自满松懈，而应当乘胜前进，创造更大的胜利。由于粮食单位面积产量可以不断大量地提高，在粮食产量进一步增加以后，就有可能挤出一部分耕地来造林。因此，在地多人少的地方，在粮食单位面积产量已经达到两千斤的地方，应当考虑用三分之一的耕地来造林，使这些地方最先实现园林化，并且成为新的木材生产基地。
    现在，秋季造林的季节已到。今年秋冬季全国造林的任务是：大片造林一亿五千万亩以上，四旁植树比上半年再翻一番，采种十六亿斤；新造林地上的补植加密工作，也应当一并完成，做到“一株不缺，一亩不少”。此外，在种苗及绿化规划等方面，还应该为明年及今后的造林做好准备。
    下半年的造林，能不能以上半年那样的速度继续前进呢？回答是肯定的。上半年造林在二千万亩以上的省有七个，造林一百万亩以上的县有十四个，造林五十万亩至一百万亩的县有三十六个。经验也证明，农业和林业是能够同时跃进的。早稻千斤省之一的安徽省，去冬今春完成了水利工程五十八亿土方，在上半年又造林三千多万亩。贵州黔东南自治州，全州一百八十万人，在完成了一百一十万亩新修水利的任务后，在上半年苦战七十天，用了七千万个劳动日，造林一千一百万亩，基本完成全州造林任务。经过了上半年造林的大跃进，各地都在思想上组织上以及造林的技术上取得了丰富的经验。目前，人民公社的迅速建立，为今后大规模造林提供了更有力的保证。今年树木种籽结实情况良好，是个丰收年；由于春季以来抓紧了育苗工作，已经准备好一大批秋冬可以出圃造林的苗木。所有这些，都是比上半年更为有利的重要条件。只要抓紧领导，下半年的任务定会超额完成。
    目前，全国各地正在进行采种工作。秋季造林，在甘肃、辽宁、河北、陕西等省也已开始。其他省区也在进行规划、布置。不过，使规划变为现实，还需要一番努力。为了保证完成任务，各地应根据本地任务、季节和林地自然条件等不同情况做好具体安排。
    大跃进以来我们获得的一条最根本的经验，就是造林工作必须政治挂帅，加强党的领导，充分发动群众。大规模的造林工作更不例外。上半年各地造林的经验证明，那里领导抓得紧，那里群众的干劲就大，成绩也就大。因此，各地党委在抓工农业等中心任务的同时，应当安排出一定的精力与时间，狠狠地抓一抓造林工作。目前造林工作中存在着各种右倾保守思想。如有人认为农业生产任务多，造林可以小搞、少搞或慢搞。这些同志不懂得，造林事业是我们国家社会主义建设的重要组成部分之一，必须鼓足干劲，力争上游，像其他建设事业一样高速度地前进。有人认为平原宜林地少，没什么可搞的了。这种看法也不对。安徽灵璧县上半年在全县仅有的十多万亩山地上造完林之外，又完成四旁植树二十五亿多株，全县平均每人植树三千多株。可见平原区四旁植树的潜力不是很小，而是很大。随着农业的高额丰产和交通、水利建设的发展，新的宜林地区在不断出现，造林工作也必须紧紧跟上去。在某些地区，有人认为绿化已经到顶了。事实上并非如此。就拿今年上半年全国三百六十七个完成了本地区荒山荒地造林任务的县份来说，也只是刚刚完成绿化的第一步；补植、加密以及抚育幼林的任务还很繁重。同时为了向园林化的方向发展，更需不间断地发展林业。少数地区还有人见到今年天旱，新造幼林枯死了一部分，或者见到现有的荒山荒地多是树木生长条件较为困难的地方，便认为群众造林热情再不会那么高了。显然，这是对群众的觉悟与力量认识不足的表现。在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，群众的干劲是无穷无尽的。树是人栽活的，一次死了二次再栽，直到栽活为止。不论林地条件如何困难，人民群众都会战胜这些困难。有些已经绿化的地区，不就是这样做的结果吗？湖南祁东县在石头山上造林，甘肃民勤县在滚腾不定的沙漠中建成了绿色的长城等等事实，都是最雄辩的证明。
    在秋冬季里，广大农村除了大搞工业之外，还要从事深翻土地、兴修水利等中心工作，任务繁巨，劳力的确紧张。但是尽管是这样，造林所需要的劳力问题，也并不是不能解决的。在这方面上半年已经取得了一条成功的经验，这就是党委统一规划和全面安排。在人力上，要使专业造林队与广泛动员劳力相结合；在时间上，提倡农忙小干、农闲大干，使常年准备（小干）与短期突击（大干）相结合；在地区上，要从大处着眼，用组织山川协作的办法，帮助人口稀少的偏远地区完成造林任务；在各项工作的安排上，要善于把造林工作与中心工作相结合，或是穿插在中心工作的空隙中进行。整个秋冬季的造林运动，大家既要贯彻季季造、天天造的精神，又要有节奏地组织几个短期突击的造林高潮。我们绿化祖国的伟大事业就是要这样不断前进。
