　　Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 3rd—Aziz Sharif, Secretary-General of the Iraqi National Committee of Peace Warriors, and Abdul Wahab Mahmoud, Chairman of the Iraqi Lawyers Association, told Xinhua News Agency reporters here on the evening of the 2nd that the Iraqi people warmly and sincerely hope for and firmly support the Chinese people's victorious liberation of Taiwan. They said that the liberation of Taiwan is the indisputable right of the Chinese people.
    In separate interviews with Xinhua News Agency reporters, they also said that the imperialist provocations in the Far East and the Middle East are part of a carefully planned scheme, similar to the aggression and provocative actions carried out by the imperialists against Egypt and Hungary in 1956, aimed at dispersing the people's resistance forces. They further pointed out that in 1956, the United States pretended to be against aggression, but in reality, it supported Britain and France. At that time, the United States hoped that Saudi Arabian oil would flow into their country, and it hoped that if the British and French plan failed, it would not be implicated.
    They pointed out that the imperialists, especially the US imperialists, are trying to bring the world to the brink of war, but they are very weak if they encounter resolute resistance from the people. They pointed out that the landing of US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan was intended to attack Iraq, but their despicable intentions were not realized due to the resolute resistance of the Iraqi people with the help of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries.
    In answering reporters' questions about what steps should be taken to stop the aggression and provocative actions in the Middle East and the Far East, they said that the best way in this regard is for the people of the Far East and the Middle East to unite and clearly express their willingness and readiness to stop aggression. They both finally stated that the Iraqi people will never forget the Chinese people's support for their struggle, and they will take the same attitude to support the Chinese people in thwarting the imperialist conspiracy against China.

　　伊拉克事件证明美帝国主义衰弱
    人民坚决行动就能击退战争挑衅
    伊和平战士委员会和律师协会负责人谈远东局势
    新华社巴格达3日电　伊拉克和平战士全国委员会秘书长阿齐兹·谢里夫和伊拉克律师协会主席阿卜杜勒·瓦哈卜·马哈茂德2日晚上在这里对新华社记者说，伊拉克人民热烈地、衷心地希望并且坚定地支持中国人民胜利地解放台湾。他们说，解放台湾是中国人民的不容争辩的权利。
    他们在单独接见新华社记者时还说，帝国主义在远东和中东的挑衅是经过严密策划的同一计划，类似1956年帝国主义者对埃及和匈牙利进行的旨在分散人民抵抗力量的侵略和挑衅行动。他们进一步指出，在1956年，美国装出一副反对侵略的样子，但是实际上它是支持英法的，当时美国希望沙特阿拉伯的石油流到他们国内去，并且希望如果英法的计划失败的话，它不会受牵累。
    他们指出，帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者企图把世界带到战争边缘上，但是如果他们遭到人民坚决抵抗的话，他们是非常软弱的。他们指出，美英军队在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆是为了进攻伊拉克，但是由于伊拉克人民在苏联、中国以及其他国家的帮助下进行坚决抵抗，他们的卑鄙意图没有实现。
    在回答记者提出的应采取什么步骤来制止在中东和远东的侵略和挑衅行动的问题时，他们说，在这方面最好的办法是远东和中东各国人民团结一致，明确表示他们愿意和随时准备制止侵略。他们最后都表示，伊拉克人民永远不能忘记中国人民对他们的斗争的支持，他们要采取同样的态度来支持中国人民挫败帝国主义对中国的阴谋。
