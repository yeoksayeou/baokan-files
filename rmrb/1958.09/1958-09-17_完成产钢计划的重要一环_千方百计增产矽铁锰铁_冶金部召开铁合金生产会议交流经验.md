Completing the steel production plan's important link
Make every effort to increase production of silicon iron and manganese iron
The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry Holds Iron Alloy Production Meeting to Exchange Experiences

(Our Dispatch) Silicon iron and manganese iron are important raw materials for steelmaking. Vigorously increasing the production of silicon iron and manganese iron is an extremely important and urgent issue for the current development of the national steel industry. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has already started working with various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, making every effort to immediately take effective measures to increase the production of silicon iron and manganese iron to meet the urgent needs of steelmaking production.

From September 2nd to 5th, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry convened a national iron alloy production meeting to exchange experiences in iron alloy production from various regions and propose some measures. The meeting pointed out that producing iron alloys, especially smelting silicon iron and manganese iron, is not difficult. The leaders of the Shijiazhuang Xinde Calcium Carbide Chemical Factory in Hebei Province put politics in command and converted the calcium carbide furnace to produce silicon iron in just one day and night. Now it can supply the entire Hebei Province's steelmaking needs. This experience is worth promoting. The meeting also pointed out that increasing the production of silicon iron and manganese iron must involve taking measures from multiple aspects: First, using the calcium carbide furnaces of calcium carbide chemical factories and the electric furnaces of steel mills and foundries to convert to producing silicon iron is a powerful measure that can yield immediate results. Provinces and cities such as Beijing, Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and Jilin have such calcium carbide factories or calcium carbide furnaces, and some can be converted to produce silicon iron immediately. In order to help the leap forward in steel, the Ministry of Chemical Industry also strongly supports this measure. Second, using small blast furnaces with hot blast can smelt manganese iron and silicon iron with lower silicon content. Currently, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company all have small blast furnaces specializing in the production of manganese iron, and Yunnan Province also has small blast furnaces producing silicon iron. Third, use old transformers or rush to manufacture small transformers, and install one or two simple small electric furnaces in old factory buildings to produce silicon iron. Fourth, give full play to the production potential of existing iron alloy factories. Factories in Jilin, Fushun, Sichuan, Guiyang, and other places are deeply mobilizing the masses and striving to increase the production of iron alloys. Fifth, in steelmaking production, experiments should be conducted to use less or even no silicon iron and manganese iron. At present, in steelmaking production, some converters rely solely on adding silicon iron to increase the temperature of molten steel, which is a great waste. The temperature of the pig iron furnace can be increased to increase the silicon content of pig iron during the melting process; methods such as deoxidizing molten iron in the furnace and adding a small amount of manganese ore during the steelmaking process can be used to reduce or even eliminate the use of silicon iron and manganese iron in steelmaking. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has organized technical personnel to study this issue.

The meeting also decided that the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry would organize several iron alloy factories to run short-term training courses in batches to train technical backbones for the production of iron alloys in 25 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, so as to quickly participate in production.

(Our Dispatch) In order to guarantee the magnificent task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year and support steelmaking, Hebei Province has decided to convert the calcium carbide furnace of Shijiazhuang Xinde Calcium Carbide Chemical Factory to produce silicon iron. At the beginning of September, led by the secretary, the entire factory mobilized and fought for a day and night to convert the calcium carbide furnace to produce silicon iron.

Shijiazhuang Xinde Calcium Carbide Chemical Factory is a small factory producing calcium carbide with simple equipment. The furnace is made of ordinary refractory bricks. There is only one 400 kVA transformer and one electric furnace, and the electrodes are manufactured by themselves. There are a total of 18 production workers.

Since the production of calcium carbide and silicon iron are very similar, the conversion to silicon iron production was not difficult. They have already achieved better technical and economic indicators.

    完成产钢计划的重要一环
    千方百计增产矽铁锰
    铁冶金部召开铁合金生产会议交流经验
    本报讯　矽铁和锰铁是炼钢的重要原料，大力增产矽铁和锰铁，是当前全国钢铁工业发展的一个极为重要而迫切的问题。冶金工业部已和各省、市、自治区一齐动手，千方百计，立即采取有效措施来增加矽铁和锰铁的生产，以供应炼钢生产中的急需。
    冶金工业部在9月2日至5日，召开了全国铁合金生产会议，交流了各地生产铁合金的经验，并提出了一些措施。会议指出：生产铁合金，特别是冶炼矽铁和锰铁并不困难。河北省石家庄信德电石化工厂，领导上政治挂帅，一昼夜就把电石炉改产了矽铁，现在可以供应河北全省炼钢的需要，这一经验值得推广。会议同时指出：增产矽铁、锰铁必须从多方面采取措施：第一、利用电石化工厂的电石炉和炼钢厂、铸造厂的电炉，改产矽铁，是一项可以立即收效的有力措施。北京、四川、云南、浙江、吉林等省市，都有这种电石工厂或电石炉，有一些可以马上改产矽铁。化工部为了帮助钢铁的跃进，也大力支持这一措施。第二、利用有热风的炼铁小高炉，可以炼锰铁和含矽较低的矽铁。目前，鞍山钢铁公司、石景山钢铁厂、马鞍山钢铁公司都已有小高炉专门生产锰铁，云南省也有小高炉生产矽铁。第三、改用旧变压器或突击制造小型变压器，利用旧厂房安装一、二个简易的小电炉生产矽铁。第四、发挥现有铁合金工厂的生产潜力，吉林、抚顺、四川、贵阳等地工厂，正深入发动群众，努力增产铁合金。第五、在炼钢生产中应试验少用或甚至不用矽铁和锰铁。目前在炼钢生产中，有些转炉只靠加矽铁来提高钢水温度，这是很大的浪费，可以用提高化铁炉温度，使生铁在熔化过程中增加含矽量；可以用铁水在炉内脱氧、在炼钢过程中加入少量锰矿等办法，来减少甚至不用矽铁、锰铁去炼钢。冶金部已组织技术人员研究这一问题。
    会上还决定了由冶金部组织几个铁合金工厂，分批开办短期训练班，为全国二十五个省、市、自治区，突击培养生产铁合金的技术骨干，以便迅速参加到生产中去。
    本报讯　为了保证今年产钢一千零七十万吨的宏伟任务，支援炼钢，河北省确定将石家庄市信德电石化工厂的电石炉改产了矽铁。这个工厂在9月初由书记挂帅，全厂动员，鏖战一昼夜，即将电石炉改产了矽铁。
    石家庄信德电石化工厂是一个生产电石的小厂，设备简单，炉子是用普通耐火砖砌成，只有四百千伏安的变压器和电炉各一台，电极是自己制造的，一共有生产工人十八名。
    由于电石与矽铁生产大同小异，所以改产矽铁并无困难，他们已经达到了较好的技术经济指标。
