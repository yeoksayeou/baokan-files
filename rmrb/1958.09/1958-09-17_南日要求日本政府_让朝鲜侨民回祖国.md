Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th - Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement today on the issue of Korean residents in Japan returning to their homeland. The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that satisfying the wishes of Korean citizens residing in Japan to return to their homeland is a matter of urgency.

The statement pointed out that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has always regarded safeguarding the national rights of Korean citizens residing abroad as its important task, and has repeatedly requested the Japanese government to guarantee Korean residents in Japan the right to settle down and enjoy all legal rights that foreigners should enjoy in Japan, to immediately and unconditionally release Korean citizens illegally detained in Japanese internment camps, and to return to their homeland according to their free will, and to take practical measures for this purpose.

The statement said that our just demands and measures have received support from Korean residents in Japan, the people of Korea and Japan, and broad world opinion.

The statement said that most Korean citizens residing in Japan live in extremely miserable conditions due to unemployment and deprivation of legal rights, and many young people cannot enjoy the right to receive democratic national education, and their lives are not guaranteed after entering higher education. The statement continued that Korean citizens illegally detained in Japanese internment camps are being forcibly deported to South Korea and used for improper political purposes.

The statement pointed out that the situation of Korean residents in Japan has deteriorated so much because the Japanese government does not accept the legitimate suggestions of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and refuses to take practical measures to protect their lives and rights. Therefore, the responsibility lies entirely with the Japanese government.

The statement emphasized that Korean citizens who have lost their livelihood in Japan have every right to return to their homeland - the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - to live a happy life, and no one can infringe on their legitimate right.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea demands that the Japanese government immediately take effective measures to hand over Korean citizens who wish to return to the Republic to the Republic's side, so as to resolve the issue of Korean residents in Japan returning home as soon as possible.

The statement concluded by expressing hope that the Japanese government will cooperate.

    南日要求日本政府
    让朝鲜侨民回祖国
    据新华社平壤16日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日今天就旅日朝鲜侨民归国问题发表了一项声明。声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为满足旅日朝鲜公民返回祖国的愿望是刻不容缓的问题。
    声明指出，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，一向认为维护侨居国外的朝鲜公民的民族权利是自己的重要任务，并且已经屡次要求日本政府保障旅日朝鲜公民安家立业和享受外国人在日本应享有的一切合法权利，立即无条件地释放被非法扣留在日本收容所的朝鲜公民，按照他们的自由意志返回祖国，并为此采取实际措施。
    声明说，我们的这一正当要求和措施，获得了旅日朝鲜公民和朝日两国人民以及世界广泛舆论的支持。
    声明说，侨居在日本的大部分朝鲜公民由于失业和被剥夺合法权利，过着极其悲惨的生活，许多青少年不能享有接受民主的民族教育的权利，在升学后生活得不到保证。声明接着说，被非法扣留在日本收容所的朝鲜公民，被强迫遣送到南朝鲜去并且被利用于不当的政治目的。
    声明指出，旅日朝鲜公民的处境所以如此恶化，是因为日本政府不接受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的正当建议，拒不采取实际措施来保障他们的生活和权利，因此，这一责任完全在于日本政府。
    声明强调说，在日本失去生活之路的朝鲜公民，完全有权利返回自己的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国过幸福的生活，任何人都不能侵犯他们的这一正当权利。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府要求日本政府立即采取有效措施，将希望回到共和国的朝鲜公民移交给共和国方面，以便早日解决旅日朝鲜公民的回国问题。
    声明最后表示希望日本政府给予合作。
