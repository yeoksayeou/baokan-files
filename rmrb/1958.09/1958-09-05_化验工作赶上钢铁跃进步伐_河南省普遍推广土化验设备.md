　　Assay Work Catches Up with the Great Leap Forward in Steel
　　Henan Province Popularizes Indigenous Assay Equipment
    (Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 4th dispatch) The Henan Provincial Institute of Industrial and Mining Experiments recently created a set of indigenous assay equipment, paving the way for the rapid, economical, and universal establishment of assay laboratories in various locations. Currently, a considerable number of special districts, counties, people's communes, and industrial and mining enterprises in Henan Province have established assay laboratories using this equipment. They are using the assay and analysis of various resources, raw materials, and finished products to promote the large-scale development of industrial production centered on the steel industry.
    Since the beginning of this year, more than 380,000 small factories and mines have been built and put into production throughout Henan Province. These factories and mines, especially steel enterprises, urgently need assay work to cooperate with them, whether in construction or production. Previously, only a few special districts, cities, and some larger factories and mines in Henan Province had assay laboratories. Under the current circumstances of large-scale industrial development, this has led to assay work queuing up and sample backlogs. In many places, when developing steel production, the proportion of ingredients was incorrect due to the lack of assay equipment, resulting in phenomena such as blast furnace breakouts, failure to separate iron slag, and poor product quality.
    In order to meet the needs of the development of local industries centered on the steel industry, various places want to establish their own assay laboratories. However, foreign assay equipment is not available for purchase, and even if it is available, many places cannot use it because there is no power supply. In response to this situation, the Henan Provincial Institute of Industrial and Mining Experiments organized a group of technicians in early July, who, after more than 20 days of experiments, successfully trial-produced a set of indigenous assay equipment. This equipment maintains the same assay principles, is simple in equipment, easy to operate, and can use local materials and be manufactured locally. It includes equipment for comprehensive assay laboratories, as well as equipment for assaying steel and other single products.
    The equipment of the comprehensive assay laboratory that they successfully tested includes a high-temperature furnace, a carbon-fixing furnace, and a nitrogen-fixing furnace made of blue bricks and fueled by coal, with an iron plate placed on the furnace as an electric heating plate, and an indigenous drying oven made of galvanized iron sheet as a distilled water tank. This completely replaces all high-temperature electric heating equipment made of metal in the assay laboratory. The construction of a comprehensive assay laboratory based on these indigenous assay equipment only requires about 1,800 yuan, while using foreign equipment would require more than 10,000 yuan. The assay effect of this indigenous equipment is almost identical to the data analyzed by foreign methods. The time required to build this equipment and master the operating techniques is very short.
    The relevant departments of Henan Province are vigorously promoting this indigenous assay equipment.

　　化验工作赶上钢铁跃进步伐
　　河南省普遍推广土化验设备
    本报郑州4日电　河南省工矿试验所最近创造出一套土化验设备，为各地多快好省地普遍建立化验室铺平了道路。现在，河南省已经有不少专区、县和人民公社、工矿企业用这种设备建立了化验室。它们正在通过对各种资源、原材料和成品的化验分析，来促进以钢铁工业为中心的工业生产的大发展。
    今年以来，河南全省已经有三十八万多个小型厂矿建成投入生产。这些厂矿特别是钢铁企业，无论是建厂还是生产，都迫切需要化验工作来配合。河南省原来只有少数几个专区、市和一些比较大的厂矿有化验室。在现在工业大发展的情况下，便形成了化验工作排队，样品积压。不少地方在发展钢铁生产的时候，因为没有化验设备，配料的比例不对，而发生了高炉座底、铁渣不分和产品质量不高的现象。
    各地为适应以钢铁工业为中心的地方工业发展的需要，都想自己建立化验室。可是洋的化验设备买不到，就是能够买到，很多地方因为没有电源也无法使用。根据这种情况，河南省工矿试验所在7月初组织一批技术人员，经过二十多天的试验，试制成功一套土化验设备。这种设备化验原理不变，设备简单，操作简便，可以就地取材，就地制造。其中有综合性化验室的设备，也有化验钢铁和其它单项产品的设备。
    他们试验成功的综合性化验室的设备，包括用青砖砌成的以煤为燃料的高温炉、定炭炉、定氮炉，炉上放一块铁板当作电热加温板，以白铁皮制成的土烘箱当蒸馏水箱。这样便完全代替了化验室中用金属做的一切高温电热设备。以这些土化验设备为主建设起来的综合性化验室，只需一千八百元左右，可是用洋设备便需要一万多元。这种土设备的化验效果和洋法分析的数据几乎完全相同。建造这种设备和掌握操作技术的时间都很短。
    河南省的有关部门正在大力推广这种土化验设备。
