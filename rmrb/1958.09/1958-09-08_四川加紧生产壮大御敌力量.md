Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, September 6th: People from all walks of life in Sichuan Province resolutely support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement and oppose the US imperialist military provocations in the Taiwan Strait.

Liu Wenhui, Vice Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: "I fully support Premier Zhou's statement. Taiwan is sacred territory of China. Liberating Taiwan and all other islands belonging to our country is our internal affair and the unshakeable determination of the Chinese people. I firmly believe that the Chinese people, who have won victory through a long struggle against imperialism, will surely smash imperialist provocations. Any aggression and provocation by US imperialism is bound to meet with complete failure."

The person in charge of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, representing all the province's workers, stated: "If US imperialism dares to interfere in our liberation of Taiwan and coastal islands, and imposes war on us, the Chinese people will certainly give it a devastating blow. All workers in Sichuan Province resolutely respond to the great call of the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to double steel production this year, and make our utmost efforts to realize this year's production leap forward plan, contributing everything we have to the liberation of Jinmen, Mazu, Taiwan, Penghu and other places."

In order to strengthen our national and defense capabilities, the people of our city must complete the task of producing 860,000 tons of steel, accelerate the organization of people's communes, and make our strength even greater."

Liao Shigang, a worker representative from Chongqing, said at the meeting: "Our city's workers have already launched a vigorous struggle to fight for steel. We guarantee to produce 860,000 tons of steel this year, further strengthen our national and defense capabilities, and produce more steel and various products for the liberation of Taiwan and coastal islands."
