Dulles' Echo
By our commentator

British Foreign Secretary Lloyd delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly on the 25th. If we compare his speech with Dulles' clamoring, we can see the mystery.

Dulles said: The Chinese Communist's armed aggression has created a serious threat;
Lloyd said: The Taiwan Strait crisis should not be resolved by force. The large-scale bombardment of Jinmen by the Communist army quickly aggravated the crisis.
Dulles said: We are prepared to resolve the dispute by peaceful means;
Lloyd said: We welcome the conciliatory attitude taken by the US government.
Dulles said: We hope to achieve a ceasefire soon to eliminate provocative actions;
Lloyd said: We hope to immediately stop this use of force (referring to our army's shelling of Jinmen).

Lloyd went even further than Dulles, saying: Britain opposes the rude and provocative language used by the spokesmen of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union regarding the situation.

From this, it seems that the dignified British Foreign Secretary Lloyd is nothing more than Dulles' echo.

Who exactly caused the current tense situation in the Taiwan Strait region and our coastal islands? Of course, the tense situation did not arise because the Chinese people want to liberate the universally recognized islands belonging to China. Anyone with common sense knows that the war between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek group has been going on for more than thirty years. China's civil war will not cause international tension, just like the American Civil War. The danger of war between China and the United States exists because of the war provocation policy of the United States, even British bourgeois public opinion generally admits this.

Martin, the chief writer of the British "New Statesman and Nation" weekly, wrote: For ten years, the despicable leader (Chiang Kai-shek) of this corrupt and remnant group has been supported by the United States while clamoring to attack the mainland; he has frequently harassed China's shipping industry and various towns on the mainland; and just recently he was allowed to transport troops to Jinmen in a steady stream. Jinmen is a part of China, just as Long Island is a part of the United States. Martin then pointed out: The danger of a large-scale nuclear war has arisen due to American militarists, because they believe that the Jinmen situation is an opportunity to test new weapons, and that the United States is in a "superior" position and can "showdown" now.

Does this weekly's revelation of the origin of the crisis in the Taiwan Strait region not coincide with the recent aggression activities of the United States? The United States has been transferring missile units, nuclear-armed aircraft, and warships to the Taiwan Strait. American generals are threatening China with nuclear war at every turn. Is this for defense? However, Lloyd pretends not to see these things, picks up Dulles' leftovers, forcibly defends the American aggressors, falsely accuses the Chinese people, and shamelessly says that he "welcomes" the "conciliatory attitude" taken by the United States. What kind of "conciliatory attitude" is this? Mobilizing huge armed forces to threaten the Chinese people with war; disregarding the Chinese people's serious warnings more than ten times, American warships and aircraft continue and expand provocative activities of invading China's territorial waters, inland seas, and airspace, and transport heavy artillery and new weapons to Jinmen. May I ask, if the United States really has a bit of a "conciliatory attitude," why bother to mobilize so many troops and make such a big fuss? If the United States has a bit of "sincerity" for reconciliation, why not withdraw its armed forces from the Taiwan Strait? Wouldn't that immediately and permanently eliminate the danger of war between China and the United States? Regarding the British authorities' behavior of covering up for the United States, the British "World News" weekly commented: Macmillan pretends to be calling for a "non-use of force to resolve disputes," but he ignores the fact that the United States is using a large number of troops and dollars to help Chiang Kai-shek continue to occupy Taiwan and the coastal islands and provoke the Chinese mainland.

Lloyd's speech at the UN General Assembly, full of slander and hostility towards the Chinese people, has its reasons. After Lloyd made a defense for the US aggression, he then talked about the Jordan issue. He said that Jordan is a besieged country, "When this situation continues to exist, it is impossible to say that the resolution of August 21 (referring to the resolution passed by the UN General Assembly in which Arab countries demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan) has been implemented in the spirit in which it was proposed and accepted." He also said that the Jordanian government has been subjected to rude and vicious attacks from broadcasts outside Jordanian territory. In the end, the fox's tail was revealed, that is, the British troops have not and are not prepared to withdraw from Jordan. Such is the face of the aggressor! Relying on the power of the United States, the British aggressors who re-occupied Jordan colluded with the United States in the issue of invading Taiwan and coastal islands of our country, and acted as accomplices, what is so strange about that? However, Lloyd's speech can open people's eyes. On the same day, the 25th, British Prime Minister Macmillan said in a meeting with trade union leaders: The British government is willing to "help seek a solution to the Taiwan dispute through diplomatic negotiations." If this so-called "help" is just the "ceasefire" sought in Lloyd's speech, then it is not difficult for us to understand that this so-called "help" is just another name for accomplice.

    杜勒斯的应声虫
    本报评论员
    英国外交大臣劳埃德25日在联大发表演说。如果把他的发言，同美国杜勒斯的叫嚣对照一下，就可以看出个中奥妙。
    杜勒斯说：中国共产党的武装侵略造成了严重的威胁；
    劳埃德说：台湾海峡危机不应该用武力来解决，共产党军队对金门的大规模轰击很快使危机加剧了。
    杜勒斯说：我们准备用和平方法解决争端；
    劳埃德说：我们欢迎美国政府所采取的和解态度。
    杜勒斯说：我们希望很快实现停火，以消除挑衅行动；
    劳埃德说：我们希望即停止这个使用武力的行动（指我军炮轰金门）。
    劳埃德还比杜勒斯更进一步，他说：英国反对中华人民共和国和苏联发言人所使用的有关局势的粗暴和挑衅性的语言。
    由此看来，原来堂堂英国外交大臣的劳埃德不过是杜勒斯的应声虫。
    究竟是谁造成了目前台湾海峡地区和我国沿海岛屿的紧张局势呢？当然，紧张局势不会是由于中国人民要解放举世公认的属于中国的岛屿而起。任何有常识的人都知道，中国人民同蒋介石集团之间的战争已经打了三十多年。中国的内战不会引起国际紧张局势，正像美国的南北战争一样。中美之间之所以存在触发战争的危险，连英国资产阶级舆论也普遍承认是美国的战争挑衅政策造成的。
    英国“新政治家与民族”周刊主笔马丁写道：十年来，这个腐朽残余集团的遭人唾弃的领袖（蒋介石）在扬言进攻大陆时一直受到美国的支持；他经常骚扰中国的航运业和大陆的各城镇；就在最近还让他把军队源源运往金门。金门是中国的一部分，正如长岛是美国的一部分。马丁接着指出：由于美国军国主义者而产生了发生大规模核武器战争的危险，因为他们认为金门局势是试验新武器的机会，并且认为美国是处在“优势”，可以现在“摊牌”。
    这家周刊所揭露的台湾海峡地区危机的由来，如果同美国最近的侵略活动对照一下，不是十分吻合吗？美国一直在把导弹部队、带核弹的飞机和军舰调到台湾海峡来。美国的将军们，口口声声在以发动核战争威胁中国。这些是为的防御吗？然而，劳埃德竟装作看不见这些，拾起杜勒斯的唾余，为美国侵略者强作辩解，反诬中国人民，并且还厚颜无耻地说什么“欢迎”美国所采取的“和解态度”。什么样的“和解态度”呢？调动了庞大的武装部队，对中国人民进行战争威胁；不顾中国人民十几次的严重警告，美国军舰飞机继续和扩大着侵入中国领海、内海和领空的挑衅活动，并且把重型大炮、新式武器运到金门。试问，美国如果真是具有一点“和解态度”，又何必这样兴师动众，大动干戈呢？美国如果有一点“和解”诚意，为什么不撤走在台湾海峡的武装部队，那样，岂不是立刻而且永远可以消除中美之间的战争危险了吗？对于英国当局这种替美国打掩护的行为，英国的“世界新闻”周刊评论说：麦克米伦伪装成呼吁“不用武力解决争端”的样子，但是他不顾美国用大批军队和美元帮助蒋介石继续占据台湾和沿海岛屿并且对中国大陆挑衅的事实。
    劳埃德在联大的演说，充满了对中国人民的诬蔑和敌视，是有他的因缘的。在劳埃德为美国的侵略作了一通辩解之后，接着就谈到了约旦问题。他说约旦是一个受包围的国家，“当这种情况继续存在的时候，即使硬要说8月21日的决议（指联大通过的阿拉伯国家要求从黎巴嫩、约旦撤出外国军队的决议）已经在按照提出它和接受它时的精神在实施，也是不可能的”。他还说约旦政府遭到约旦领土以外的地方的广播无礼的恶毒的攻击。说来说去，最后露出了狐狸尾巴，就是英国军队没有并且还不准备撤出约旦。侵略者的嘴脸就是如此！仗着美国的声势，重新侵占了约旦的英国侵略者，在美国侵略我国台湾和沿海岛屿问题上，同恶相济，狼狈为奸，又有什么奇怪呢？然而劳埃德的演说却可以使人们擦亮眼睛。就在25日这同一天，英国首相麦克米伦在同工会领袖的会谈中说：英国政府愿意“帮助用外交谈判的方法谋求台湾争端的解决”。这个所谓“帮助”，如果就是劳埃德演说里所谋求的“停火”，那末我们就不难理解，这个所谓“帮助”也者，不过是帮凶的别名而已。
