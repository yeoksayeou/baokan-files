　　Philosophy Will Become a Mass Movement
　　Sun Dingguo
    Since the news of workers at the Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard and farmers in Henan's Sanguanmiao Township studying and applying philosophy was published in the People's Daily, in a very short period, a nationwide upsurge in the study of philosophy by workers, farmers, and even housewives has rapidly emerged, echoing one another. Practice has proven that they learn well and apply it wonderfully.
    The formation of this mass movement to study philosophy is by no means accidental. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, our Party has always used the proletarian world outlook as a tool for observing the fate of the nation, and at the same time, has always regarded educating the people with dialectical materialism as its primary task. For decades, this spirit has been貫穿 throughout both the guidance of revolutionary practice and theoretical propaganda. With the victory of the revolution and construction, Marxist philosophical thought has increasingly penetrated the hearts of the people, especially the thoughts expressed by Comrade Mao Zedong in his works "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Since last year, after the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts through the anti-Rightist struggle and the nationwide rectification campaign, the people of the whole country are faced with a new situation of a great leap forward in production like ten thousand horses galloping ahead. The increasingly communistic-minded workers and peasants, especially the grassroots cadres and activists among them, inspired by the spirit of the "Two Participations and One Reform" policy (workers participating in management, cadres participating in labor, and reform of production technology and rules and regulations), in order to respond to Comrade Mao Zedong's great call to break down superstitions, liberate thought, and establish the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, and to implement the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," they are urgently demanding to improve their ideological abilities and improve their working methods. This has powerfully promoted hundreds of thousands of ordinary laborers to consciously rise up and demand to master Marxist philosophy, this ideological weapon, as a key to unlocking wisdom. We should see that this high tide of Marxist thought movement is a necessary reflection of the current high tide of production movement in our country.
    The study of philosophy by workers and peasants, due to their characteristics as socialist laborers and the requirements of the era they reflect, cannot but have the following characteristics.
    The purpose of workers and peasants in learning Marxist philosophy is clear, noble, and completely different from that of bourgeois intellectuals. They do not regard Marxist philosophy as something floating in the sky, but as something that can blossom and bear fruit on the land of the motherland. They study philosophy solely to serve the practice of class struggle and production struggle, solely for the great goal of building socialism and communism. Tang Zishan, a young worker in Sichuan, said: "Revolutionary leaders studied theory in order to overthrow capitalism. Now that we are liberated, we should study theory even more in order to build socialism." Comrade Wei Changgeng said bluntly that they study philosophy in order to solve key problems in production, and that they propose topics, analyze and study them, and solve them based on problems in production practice. This characteristic is prominently demonstrated by workers and farmers in various places learning philosophy. This fully proves the class nature and practicality of Marxist philosophy as pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong. In contrast, bourgeois intellectuals regard philosophy as a tool for acquiring fame and status and disguising themselves. In recent years, some idealist philosophers, on the surface, are also studying Marxist philosophy, but in essence, the ghosts of Plato, Confucius, Hegel, and Mach are still firmly haunting their minds. They study Marxist philosophy only to use it as a "driving license" to "register" and "sign up" in the academic world. A small number of young intellectuals were once confused by this evil wind, yearning to become "philosophy experts" like Feng Youlan and He Lin. Obviously, this petty and despicable purpose is determined by their class position. With such a purpose, they will never touch the edge of Marxist philosophy in their lives.
    Position determines purpose, and purpose determines method. Therefore, the method of workers and peasants in studying Marxist philosophy must be to closely link theory with practice, which is also very different from dogmatists. They do not regard philosophy as an antique for mere appreciation, but as a key to solving practical problems. They learn and apply at the same time, analyze problems and solve problems at the same time. Some philosophical principles that dogmatists have debated for days and remained entangled in, such as the primacy of existence over thinking, the subjective initiative of man, the unity of opposites in contradiction, balance and imbalance, relativity and absoluteness, etc., once combined with their production practice and living reality, they quickly grasped its essence. As people say, workers and peasants learning philosophy is like "dotting the dragon's eyes," "immediate results." This characteristic has also been vividly demonstrated by the housewives in Nankai District, Tianjin, who are studying philosophy. They used philosophy to solve what are considered by "philosophers" to be so-called "trivial matters," and they solved them very vividly and practically, improving their communist consciousness and doing a good job in street work. In the problems they solved, the power of atheism to defeat theism and the power of communism to defeat capitalism were displayed. In contrast, dogmatists regard philosophy as something beyond reality, something that reigns high above practice, a "speculative heaven" rather than a guide to action. They use concepts to explain concepts, and formulas to explain formulas. If theory is made to touch reality and solve daily life problems, it seems to them to be simplification and vulgarization, using a cannon to shoot sparrows and a tank to crush mice. Obviously, those who hold this view, if they do not correct it, will never learn Marxist philosophy well.
    At present, more and more workers and peasants are learning Marxist philosophy with great enthusiasm, especially Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical works. "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," as well as Party documents and resolutions, have become the main textbooks for the masses to study philosophy. This purposeful and mindful study has produced practical results in a short period of time, promoting socialist construction. We can imagine that if the broad masses of workers and peasants further familiarize themselves with Marxist philosophical thought and are able to use dialectical materialism to analyze and summarize their creations in production, what immeasurable role this will play in promoting the development of our country's productive forces. If they can consciously understand the Party's line, principles, and policies and understand their historical mission from the basis of their world outlook, what immeasurable role this will play in our building of socialism and development towards communism.
    For this reason, a major historical task has emerged before Marxist philosophy workers. We should regard this upsurge of learning as a nationwide popularization movement of the Marxist world outlook. We should throw ourselves into this popularization movement with joy and enthusiasm, go deep into factories and rural areas, resolutely put down the airs of intellectuals, and learn from Comrades Ma Shiting, Wei Changgeng, Li Changmao, Liu Jingying, and Xiang Shengchang, an ordinary soldier, learning from them and helping them. We resolutely oppose those erroneous arguments that workers and peasants have low culture and shallow knowledge and cannot learn philosophy, that their learning philosophy lowers the "scientificity" and "systematicity" of philosophy, and those who doubt that this movement cannot last and regard it as a flash in the pan and a fad. These fallacies have been thoroughly shattered by the facts.
    Of course, this movement needs to be further improved. We also oppose the erroneous arguments that workers and peasants are born philosophers, that practice is theory, and that sensibility is rationality. According to them, workers and peasants can completely succeed in learning philosophy through their own spontaneity, without the need for the Party's strong leadership and arduous theoretical activities. This upsurge of learning can spontaneously generate and last. This one-sided statement is also not conducive to the further development and improvement of the movement of workers and peasants learning philosophy. We must continue to do arduous propaganda and organizational work in this regard. We believe that under the leadership of the Party and with the active efforts of the workers and peasants, the omnipotent world outlook of Marxism will increasingly penetrate the hearts of the people and generate immense material power.

### 哲学将要成为全民的

　　哲学将要成为全民的
　　孙定国
    自从上海求新造船厂工人和河南三官庙乡农民学哲学用哲学的消息在人民日报公布之后，在很短的时间内，全国范围内，工人、农民以至家庭妇女，学习哲学顿成热潮，风起云涌，此呼彼应。实践证明，他们学得既好，用得也妙。
    全民学哲学的热潮的形成，决不是偶然的。正如毛泽东同志所指出的，我们党从来就是把无产阶级世界观作为观察国家命运的工具，同时又从来是把用辩证唯物论教育人民当作自己的首要任务。几十年来，不论在指导革命实践还是在理论宣传上，都贯串着这个精神。随着革命和建设的胜利，马克思主义的哲学思想日益深入人心，特别是毛泽东同志在“实践论”、“矛盾论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”等著作中所表述的思想，日益深入人心。去年以来，经过了反右派斗争和全民整风运动，取得了政治战线思想战线上的社会主义革命胜利之后，全国人民面临着势如万马奔腾的生产大跃进的新形势。日益提高了共产主义觉悟的工农群众，特别是他们中的基层骨干和积极分子，在“两参一改”（工人参加管理、干部参加劳动，改革生产技术和规章制度）政策精神的鼓舞下，为了响应毛泽东同志破除迷信、解放思想、树立敢说敢想敢作的共产主义风格的伟大号召，贯彻党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，他们迫切要求提高自己的思想能力，改进自己的工作方法。这样就有力地推动了成千上万的普通劳动者，自觉地起来要求掌握马克思主义哲学这一思想武器，作为启发智慧的钥匙。我们应该看到，这种马克思主义思想运动的高潮，乃是我国当前生产运动高潮的必然反映。
    工农群众学哲学，由于他们作为社会主义劳动者的特性，和他们所反映的时代要求，就不能不具有以下的特点。
    工农群众学马克思主义哲学，其目的是鲜明的，崇高的，截然与资产阶级知识分子不同。他们不是把马克思主义哲学看作是在天空上凌云驾雾的东西，而是把它看作是在祖国大地上能够开花结果的东西。他们学哲学，仅仅是服务于阶级斗争的实践和生产斗争的实践，仅仅是为了建设社会主义和共产主义的伟大目标。四川青年工人唐梓山说：“革命领袖为了推翻资本主义去钻研理论。现在我们解放了，为了建设社会主义，那就更应该去钻研理论”。魏长庚同志则直截了当地说，他们学哲学是为了解决生产中的关键问题，是根据生产实践中的问题提出课题，进行分析研究并加以解决。各地工人和农民学哲学都突出地表现了这一特点。这就完全证明了毛泽东同志所指出的马克思主义哲学的阶级性和实践性。与此相反，资产阶级知识分子却把哲学当作猎取名位和乔装自己的工具。近几年来，有些唯心主义哲学家，表面上也在学习马克思主义哲学，而在实质上，柏拉图、孔夫子、黑格尔、马赫的幽灵却还死死地缠绕着他们的头脑，他们学马克思主义哲学，不过是为了把它当作“行车执照”，在学术界“注册”、“挂号”。有少数青年知识分子曾经一度被这种妖风所迷惑，向往着成为冯友兰、贺麟式的“哲学专家”。显然，这种渺小卑鄙的目的，是为他们的阶级立场所决定的，抱着这样的目的，一辈子也沾不上马克思主义哲学的边。
    立场决定目的，目的决定方法，因此，工农群众学习马克思主义哲学，其方法必然是理论紧密联系实际，与教条主义者也迥然不同。他们不是把哲学当作仅供玩赏的古董，而是把它当作解决实际问题的钥匙。他们边学边用，边分析问题，边解决问题。若干为教条主义者聚讼终日、纠缠不清的哲学原理，如存在第一性思维第二性、人的主观能动性、矛盾的对立统一、平衡与不平衡、相对性与绝对性等等，一经和他们的生产实践和生活实际结合起来，他们便迅速地捕捉住了它的精神实质。正如人们所说的，工人农民学哲学，有如“画龙点睛”，“立竿见影”。这一特点，就是天津南开区学哲学的家庭妇女也作了生动的证明。她们就是运用哲学来解决了在“哲学家”们看来是所谓“婆婆妈妈”的事情，而且解决得非常生动活泼，切合实际，提高了共产主义觉悟，作好了街道工作。在她们解决的问题中，显示了无神论战胜有神论的威力，共产主义战胜资本主义的威力。与此相反，教条主义者把哲学看作是超实际的东西，是高高地君临于实践之上的东西，是“思辩的天国”，而不是行动的指南。他们用概念解释概念，用公式解释公式。如果使理论接触实际，解决日常生活问题，在他们看来就是简单化，庸俗化，是用大炮打麻雀，坦克压耗子。显然，持有这种观点的人，如不改正，也是永远学不好马克思主义哲学的。
    目前，愈来愈多的工农群众正以高度的热情学习马克思主义哲学，特别是毛泽东同志的哲学著作。“实践论”、“矛盾论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，以及党的文件和决议，已经成为群众学习哲学的主要教科书。这种有目的有头脑的学习，在短短的时间内，已经产生了实际的效果，对社会主义建设起了促进的作用。我们试想，如果广大的工人农民进一步熟悉了马克思主义哲学思想，能够用辩证唯物主义来分析和总结他们在生产中的创造，这对促进我国生产力的发展将会起着何等不可估量的作用。如果他们能够自觉地从世界观的基础上来了解党的路线、方针、政策，了解自己的历史使命，这对于我们建成社会主义并向共产主义发展将会起着何等不可估量的作用。
    为此，在马克思主义哲学工作者的面前，就出现了重大的历史任务。我们应该把这一学习热潮看作是马克思主义世界观的全民性的普及运动，我们应该以欢欣鼓舞的心情投身于这一普及运动中，深入工厂，深入农村，坚决放下知识分子的臭架子，向马仕亭、魏长庚、李长茂、刘景英、以及普通一兵向胜昌等同志学习，学习他们而又帮助他们。我们坚决反对那些认为工农文化低、知识浅不能学哲学，认为他们学哲学就降低了哲学的“科学性”和“系统性”，以及那些怀疑这一运动不能持久，把它看作是昙花一现、赶时髦等错误论调。这些谬论已被事实彻底粉碎了。
    当然，这个运动还需进一步提高。我们也反对那种认为工人农民就是天生的哲学家，实践就是理论，感性就是理性等等错误论调。按照他们看来，工农学哲学完全通过他们的自发就能获得成功，不需要通过党的坚强领导和艰苦的理论活动，这一学习热潮就能自发地产生和持久下去。这种片面的说法也是不利于工农学哲学这一运动的进一步开展和提高的。我们在这方面还必须继续作艰苦的宣传和组织工作。我们相信，在党的领导下和工农群众的积极努力下，马克思主义的万能的世界观，将会日益深入人心，产生出巨大无比的物质力量。
