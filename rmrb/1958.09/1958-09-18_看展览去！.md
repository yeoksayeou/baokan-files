Let's Go See the Exhibition!
Visiting the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition
Liu Lanshan
Entering the exhibition hall, entering the exhibition hall, my heart is so happy. Flowers bloom everywhere, tens of thousands of them, three days and three nights are not enough to see, eight years surpass eighty years, the ideal of industrialization will soon be realized.

Chang'e flies to earth, colorful silk fabrics shine brightly, attracting Chang'e to come down; heavenly clothes are not as good as new products, from now on she does not want to return to her heavenly home.

Hydroelectric power stations generate electricity from rivers, underground is better than above: press the button, silver lamps are everywhere, the stars and moon lose their light.

Forest City, the atmosphere in Forest City is new, keeping all visitors: felling trees and sawing boards is done without hands, electric power transports wood by itself; shavings are made into mahogany tables, music is played in the great forest... Forest City is the best to see, it is really hard to leave!

Atomic energy, seeing atomic energy, happy and excited. For the benefit of the new humanity, atomic energy is omnipotent. The era belongs to you, you belong to us.

    看展览去！
    参观全国工业交通展览
    刘岚山
    走进展览馆走进展览馆，心头好喜欢。遍地开花万万朵，三天三夜看不完，八年胜过八十年，工业化理想快实现。
  嫦娥奔地彩绸花布放光彩，引得嫦娥奔下来；天衣那有新产品好，从此她不愿回天台。
    水电站江河发水电，地下胜天上：电钮按一下，遍地是银灯，星月失光茫。
    森林城森林城里气象新，留住所有参观人：伐木锯板不用手，电运木头自己走；刨花制成红木桌，大森林中奏音乐……森林城里最好看，要想离开真是难！
    原子能看见原子能，快乐又欢腾。造福新人类，原子能万能。时代属于你，你属于我们。
