　　In Yuejin Ironworks, Dengjia Township, Kai County, there is a female furnace tender named He Chaozhen. She is only nineteen years old this year, not tall, but as strong as a calf. When talking to others, she always gestures with her hands and bursts into hearty laughter from time to time. Recently, she became a furnace tender, and people associated her strong personality with steel, calling her the Iron Girl.

　　The Iron Girl used to be a member of the agricultural cooperative, digging mud and tilling the soil every day, and had never seen a blast furnace. After the Party Central Committee issued the call for the whole people to run industry and vigorously develop steel production, her heart began to stir. In July of this year, after hearing that the township was going to build an iron factory, she immediately ran to the township party secretary to request a job, wanting to be a furnace tender. The township party secretary promised to give her a furnace and said that in the future, this blast furnace could be entirely managed by women, calling it a women's blast furnace.

　　At this time, both men and women began to discuss: "Since the beginning of the world, has there ever been a woman who makes iron?" "This girl, instead of working with a hoe, insists on doing something she can't do, she's just asking for trouble." Some people even scared her, saying, "The fire from the blast furnace will fly out and burn all your hair off!" "The fire hook for the blast furnace weighs more than a hundred pounds, can you handle it?" After hearing these words, she hesitated again: "What if the fire from the blast furnace flies out? What if I can't handle the iron hook?..." Just then, District Committee Secretary Wu Guanggui arrived and had a talk with her.

　　"There's nothing amazing about a blast furnace. If men can subdue it, so can women."

　　These words removed the veil covering her heart, and she suddenly felt enlightened. "That's right, if men can do it, women can definitely do it too!"

　　The master worker sent by the Party Committee to help He Chaozhen learn ironmaking arrived. There were three masters, all of whom had rich experience in ironmaking. Master Zhang said to the female apprentice, "I guarantee I'll teach you in half a year." He Chaozhen replied with a smile, "No, that's too slow. If I learn to make iron in half a year, how can it be considered a great leap forward?" Master Zhang asked, "How much time do you want to learn it in?" She said, "Half a month!" Master Zhang shook his head and just said, "We'll see!"

　　The blast furnace was ignited and started. He Chaozhen closely followed the master worker, carefully observing his movements. The temperature at the blast furnace was very high, especially when discharging slag and tapping iron, the fire shot out like a fountain. Carelessly, you could really burn your hair. However, wherever the master worker went, He Chaozhen followed. Even though her arms were blistered by the fire, she did not leave the blast furnace. She stayed until three o'clock in the morning that day before returning home. Lying in bed, she was still pondering the master worker's operating methods.

　　The next morning, she went to the factory again. The workers joked, "Didn't this girl say she wanted to grab the hook? Come and grab it today!" He Chaozhen really stepped forward, picked up a fire hook weighing more than seventy pounds, and poked around in the furnace a few times according to the master worker's operation from last night. At this time, another master worker arrived. Seeing her clearing fire and removing slag, he laughed and said, "Not bad! This girl is not bad. But she still hasn't got it right." Then he told her some operating methods for clearing fire, tapping iron, and connecting the crucible, such as "watching the slag like embroidering flowers, tapping the molten iron like fighting a fire," and "if the water is not good, the gas will rise early." He Chaozhen learned and watched at the same time. When others were off work, she was still there pondering by herself.

　　Only three days later, she requested to tend the furnace alone. The township party secretary and the district committee secretary both supported her and suggested letting her try.

　　He Chaozhen wrapped her hair in a headscarf, stepped forward, and directed the feeding of ore while watching the furnace to remove slag. When the time came, she looked at the furnace eye and said, "The molten iron is ready!" She poked the furnace door, and with a red flame, a stream of hot molten iron flowed out. Everyone shouted, "Success! Success!"

　　The first female furnace tender appeared in Kai County.

    钢铁姑娘
    韩郁
    开县邓家乡跃进铁厂有个女看炉师，名叫何朝珍，今年才十九岁，个子不高，身体却结实得像小牛一样，和别人谈起话来，总爱比划着双手，不时发出一阵爽朗的笑声。最近她当了看炉师，人们更把她坚强的性格和钢铁联系起来，管她叫钢铁姑娘了。
    钢铁姑娘过去是农业社的社员，每天挖泥刨土，从没有见过高炉。党中央提出全民办工业，大搞钢铁生产的号召后，她的心才动起来。今年7月，听说乡里要建铁厂，她连忙跑到乡支书那里请求工作，要当看炉师。乡支书答应给她一个炉子，还说以后可以全部由女子管理这个高炉，叫女子高炉。
    这时，无论男的和女的，都议论起来：“自从盘古开天地，哪有女子炼铁的？”“这个女娃娃，放着锄头不搞偏干自己干不了的事，真是自找苦吃。”还有些人吓唬她道：“高炉的火会飞，飞出来把你的头发都要烧光！”“高炉钩火的火钩有一百多斤重，你搞得起？”听了这些话，她又犹豫起来：“高炉的火飞出来该咋办？铁钩子搞不起又咋办？……”正当这时，区委书记吴光贵到了，找她谈了一次话。
    “高炉没有什么了不起，男的能够制服它，女的也可以制服它。”
    这句话，揭掉了蒙在她心上的盖子，她心里顿然开朗起来，“对呀，男的办得到的，女的就未必办不到！”
    党委派来帮助何朝珍学习炼铁的师傅来了。师傅有三个，都是富有炼铁经验的人。张师傅对女学徒说：“我保证半年把你教会。”何朝珍笑着回答：“不成，太慢了，半年后再炼铁，还算大跃进么？”张师傅问：“你想多少时间学成？”她说“半个月！”张师傅摇摇头，只说：“走着瞧吧！”
    高炉发火开工了。何朝珍紧紧地跟着师傅，仔细观察师傅的动作。高炉边温度很高，特别是落渣、放铁水时，火像喷泉一样冒出来。不留神，真的会烧掉头发。但是，师傅走到什么地方，何朝珍就跟到什么地方。虽然她的双臂被火烤得起了亮泡，她也不离开高炉。这天她一直看到深夜三点钟，才回到家里。躺在床上，还在揣摩师傅的操作方法。
    第二天清早，她又跑到厂里去了。工人们开玩笑道：“这个妹不是说要拿钩么？今天来拿嘛！”何朝珍真的走上前去，搞起一把七十多斤重的火钩，按照昨晚师傅操作的方法，在炉里通了几下。这时候，另一个师傅来了，见她在通火落渣，便哈哈大笑道：“不错！这个女娃子不错。不过还是没搞对头。”接着告诉她一些“看渣如绣花，放水如抢火”、“水不好，气上早”等钩火、出铁、接缸咀等操作方法。何朝珍边学边看，别人下班了，她还在那里自个儿琢磨。
    才过三天，她就向师傅请求单独看炉。乡支书和区委书记都支持她，建议让她试试看。
    何朝珍用头巾包好了头发，走上前去，一边指挥下矿石，一边看炉下渣。到时候，她到炉眼一看，说声“水好了！”把炉门一戳，随着红红的火焰一股炽热的铁水奔流出来。大家大喊：“成功了！成功了！”
    开县出现了第一名女看炉师。
