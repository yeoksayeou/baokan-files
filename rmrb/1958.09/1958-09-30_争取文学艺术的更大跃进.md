Strive for a Greater Leap Forward in Literature and Art
    With the great bumper harvest of grain, the great increase in steel production, the great development of people's communes, and the great revolution in technology and culture, China's socialist revolution and construction are advancing by leaps and bounds. On the literary and art front, there has also emerged an unprecedented new situation: new folk songs, rural murals, and the socialist singing movement have formed a high tide of mass literary and artistic creation and performance activities. The unprecedentedly active mass literary creation has greatly promoted the development of the entire literature and art towards the direction of workers, peasants, and communists, opening up a new stage in the development of literature and art in our country. A prominent feature of mass creation is that they reflect the communist spirit of the working people in the Great Leap Forward. They are "spirited, high-spirited, and full of vigor," with the ambition to transform society and conquer nature, and they do not see any difficulties or enemies in their eyes. They are physical laborers, but also singers, poets, and painters. From their creations, we can clearly see the sprouts of true communist literature and art.
    Simultaneously with the unfolding of the mass creation movement of the broad masses of workers and peasants, students in universities and colleges launched a criticism movement against bourgeois academic ideology. The youth, with their unstoppable momentum, sharply criticized the bourgeois viewpoints in literary and artistic teaching and research. The young Marxist forces are growing rapidly. They will become an unignorable force on the front of literary and artistic theory.
    After the anti-rightist and rectification movements, most writers and artists went deep into the lives of the masses, engaged in labor training, and participated in grassroots work, and achieved new gains in ideological transformation and artistic creation. The relationship between literary and artistic workers and the working masses has been further strengthened. The intolerable state in which many literary and artistic workers were detached from politics, reality, and the masses for a time has been fundamentally changed. Since last year, many novels, novellas, and short stories have been published, and many of these excellent works have been welcomed by the majority of readers and widely circulated among the masses. After criticizing the influence of bourgeois ideology, the film industry has also shown a new look and produced many films reflecting new people and new things. Dramas and Quyi programs reflecting new life are increasing day by day and are praised by the audience. Fine arts, songs, dances, and other aspects have also produced many good works, showing a new atmosphere.
    However, judging from the speed of production and construction and the demands of the masses, the creation of literature and art still cannot keep up with objective needs. The situation of the country's leap forward demands a greater leap forward in literature and art. And this leap forward is first and foremost a leap forward in creation, which means that more and better works are required. Literary and artistic works should have communist ideas and use communist spirit to educate the people. We are now engaged in the work of building socialism, but our higher goal is to achieve a communist society. One of the important conditions for the transition to a communist society is the great improvement of the communist ideological consciousness and moral qualities of all the people. Helping all the people to improve their communist ideological consciousness and moral qualities is the most fundamental task of our literature and art. In the life of the masses, especially due to the development of people's communes, the sprouts of communism have been vigorously growing. The revolutionary literature and art of the working class is to enthusiastically and truthfully reflect the new things and new qualities in life, reflect the spirit of our times, and use the most advanced ideas to educate the people and guide the people to move forward continuously. In the era of democratic revolution, advanced people and advanced literature and art not only fought for the purpose of realizing the democratic revolution, but also fought for the socialist ideal at the same time; in the era of socialism, advanced people and advanced literature and art not only see socialism, but also prepare conditions for the construction of a communist society. To strive for the establishment of communist literature and art is the unshirkable responsibility of this generation of literary and artistic workers.
    Such literature and art require our writers and artists to combine revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism well in their creations. That is to say, our literature and art is the most realistic, but also the literature and art with the highest ideals. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "Human social life" "is the only source of literature and art," "the life reflected in literary and artistic works" "should be higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than ordinary actual life, and therefore more universal." "Revolutionary literature and art should create various characters based on actual life." Being faithful to real life and at the same time higher than real life does not teach people to stay in today's reality, but encourages people to create a newer and more beautiful future reality. This is precisely the creative principle of the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. Our workers and peasants are holding infinite ambitions, full of communist spirit, overcoming all difficulties, and engaging in heroic construction undertakings with the attitude of masters of national life. Only by closely combining the spirit of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism can we fully express the heroic spirit of the masses of people. We can get profound inspiration from the new folk songs and murals created by the masses themselves.
    The advanced ideological content in the works requires beautiful artistic forms that are adapted to it. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago that our requirements for literature and art are "the unity of revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form possible." We should not be satisfied with rough and plain forms. We must "write the newest and most beautiful words and draw the newest and most beautiful pictures." That is to say, we must have the newest ideas and the most beautiful forms. Many new folk songs have this newest and most beautiful characteristic. The improvement in art is by no means imitating the decadent art of the bourgeoisie and the West, but creating the beautiful style of the working class and the nation. We should learn from tradition and from foreign countries, but inheriting tradition and learning from foreign countries are only for the purpose of borrowing, and the purpose is to create new socialist and communist literature and art with Chinese national characteristics. To create this kind of literature and art, our literary and artistic workers must first liberate their own thinking from the prejudices of the bourgeois literary aristocracy and the low-level tastes of individualism, break the superstition of various literary and artistic dogmas, and strive to truly integrate themselves with the working people in terms of thought and feeling, and learn from the working people and learn from their labor spirit and creative spirit. Only in this way can our writers hope to write works needed by the people.
    Our literature and art is for workers, peasants, and soldiers, for them to appreciate, and also created by themselves. Our literature and art is different from the literature and art of any past era. It is the literature and art of the whole people, the literature and art of the masses, the literature and art of the working people themselves, not the literature and art of a few people. We are facing a great era of mass creation. In literature and art, we should actively develop mass creation and mass criticism. With the popularization of education and culture, the literature and art of the masses will have greater development and prosperity. On the one hand, we should mobilize and guide the broad masses to create their own works, and on the other hand, we should deliver more and better works suitable for the needs of the masses to the masses. The popularization of literature and art is the most important task at present. It is completely wrong to despise the popularization of literature and art. However, the masses demand popularization and also demand improvement. They are not satisfied with literature and art always staying at the original level. Therefore, while vigorously popularizing, we should actively pay attention to improvement. It is not about improving behind closed doors away from the masses, but about improving together with the masses on the basis of popularization. As long as there is popularization but no improvement, or as long as there is improvement but no popularization, it is a manifestation of being detached from the masses and despising and distrusting the masses. Popularization first, the combination of popularization and improvement, this is our policy. To correctly solve the relationship between popularization and improvement, the key lies in the true combination of literary and artistic workers and the working people.
    In literary, artistic, and academic work, we adhere to the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." The vigorously developing mass creation movement and criticism movement is the embodiment of this policy. Our task is to widely unite all literary and artistic workers and encourage all kinds of literary and artistic creation on the basis of the six political criteria put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong. As long as it is not a poisonous weed, all kinds of literary and artistic works with different ideological levels and artistic levels should be allowed to coexist and compete with each other. We welcome good works, but we are not afraid of poisonous weeds. Since poisonous weeds objectively exist, we would rather let them show their heads and then hoe them out, so that more people can enhance their ability to identify them.
    In artistic creation, as in all undertakings, we advocate the style of hard work and oppose the bad habit of shoddy work. In order to reflect and cooperate with the current struggle in a timely and rapid manner, we need more short and concise works, and we also need works that make greater artistic generalizations of a certain revolutionary historical stage or historical event. No matter what kind of work is written, a serious and responsible attitude should be adopted. Every literary and artistic worker should strive to dedicate the best works written with their own efforts to the working people.
    In order to complete the above tasks, a working-class literary and artistic team must be built. After the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the literary and artistic team was tempered, experienced a reorganization process, and joined new blood. Now a large number of writers and artists have gone to the countryside, factories, and troops, and have gone deep into the working masses. Their initial gains prove that the Party's policy is completely correct. However, we must not be satisfied with the existing achievements, and we must continue to go deep and not stop at superficial understanding. Literary and artistic workers should live in the working masses for a long time, participate in labor training and grassroots work, transform themselves in the political struggle and production struggle of the masses, and obtain the source of creation. Writers and artists should not regard themselves as special figures, but should appear in the posture of ordinary laborers and integrate themselves with the masses. The current demand for reducing royalties in the literary and art circles is helpful in solving this problem. Chinese artists are valued by the Party and the government, and their lives are guaranteed. They can no longer rely entirely on royalties to maintain their lives. Royalties are only a reward for creation. Excessive royalties will only create a distance between writers and the working masses and promote the ideas of fame and fortune among some people. Only when literary and artistic workers have no distance from the working people in terms of thought, emotion, and lifestyle can they create works that meet the requirements of the masses. As long as we adhere to the correct policy of combining literary and artistic workers with the working people and serving the working people, relying on the Party, and relying on the masses, a new situation of a hundred flowers blooming and a riot of color will surely emerge further in the literary and artistic garden. Let us use a hundred times or a thousand times the effort to strive for a greater leap forward and a greater harvest in literature and art!

### 争取文学艺术的更大跃进

    争取文学艺术的更大跃进
    粮食大丰收，钢铁大增产，人民公社大发展，技术和文化大革命，我国社会主义革命和建设事业正在飞跃前进。在文艺战线上，也出现了前所未有的新形势：新民歌、农村壁画、社会主义歌咏运动，形成了群众文艺创作和表演活动的高潮。群众文艺创作的空前活跃大大促进了整个文艺向工农群众的、共产主义的方向发展，开辟了我国文学艺术发展的新阶段。群众创作的显著特点是它们反映了劳动人民在大跃进中的共产主义气概。他们“精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发”，有改造社会，征服自然的雄心，任何困难和敌人都不在眼底。他们是体力劳动者，同时又是歌手、诗人和画家。从他们的创作中，我们可以明显地看出真正共产主义文艺的萌芽。
    和广大工农群众的创作运动的展开同时，在高等学校里的学生展开了对资产阶级学术思想的批判运动。青年们以锐不可当的气势向文艺教学和研究中的资产阶级观点进行了尖锐的批判。年轻的马克思主义力量正在迅速成长。他们将成为文艺理论战线上的一支不可轻侮的力量。
    大多数作家艺术家经过反右和整风，深入群众生活，从事劳动锻炼，参加基层工作，在思想改造和艺术创作上，都取得了新的收获。文艺工作者和劳动群众的关系进一步地密切起来了。一个时候许多文艺工作者脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众的不可容忍的状态已有了根本的改变。去年以来出版了许多长篇、中篇小说和短篇小说，其中不少优秀作品受到广大读者的欢迎，在群众中广泛流传。电影在批判了资产阶级的思想影响之后，也出现了新的面貌，产生了不少反映新人新事的影片。反映新的生活的戏剧、曲艺节目日益增多，并且得到观众的称赞。美术、歌曲、舞蹈等各方面，也都产生了不少好作品，显示了新的气象。
    但是，从生产建设的速度和群众的要求来看，文学艺术的创作还是跟不上客观的需要。国家一日千里地跃进的形势，要求文学艺术事业作更大的跃进。而这个跃进首先是创作上的跃进，这就是说，要求有更多更好的作品。文学艺术作品应该具有共产主义的思想，用共产主义精神来教育人民群众。我们现在正在进行建设社会主义的工作，但是我们的更高目标是要达到共产主义社会。而过渡到共产主义社会的重要条件之一，就是全体人民的共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质的极大提高，帮助全体人民提高共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质，正是我们的文学艺术的最根本的任务。在群众生活中，特别是由于人民公社的发展，共产主义的萌芽已经蓬勃滋长。工人阶级的革命文艺就是要热情地真实地反映生活中的新事物新品质，反映我们时代的精神，用最先进的思想来教育人民，引导人民不断地前进。在民主革命时代，先进的人们和先进的文艺不仅为实现民主革命的目的而战斗，而且同时为社会主义的理想而战斗；在社会主义时代，先进的人们和先进的文艺也不仅只看到社会主义，同时也要为建设共产主义社会准备条件。为建立共产主义文艺而奋斗，是这一代的文艺工作者的无可推卸的责任。
    这样的文艺要求我们的作家艺术家在创作中把革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义很好地结合起来。这就是说，我们的文艺是最真实的，同时又是具有最高理想的文艺。毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中指出：“人类的社会生活”“是文学艺术的唯一源泉”，“文艺作品中反映出来的生活”“应该比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性”。“革命的文艺，应当根据实际生活创造出各种各样的人物来”。忠实于现实生活同时又比现实生活更高，不是教人们停留在今天的现实中，而是鼓舞人们去创造更新更美的未来的现实，这正是革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的创作原则。我们的工人和农民正抱着无限的壮志雄心，充满共产主义的精神，排除一切困难，以国家生活中的主人公的姿态，从事着豪迈的建设事业，只有把革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义精神密切地结合起来，才能充分地表达出人民群众的这种英雄气概。我们从群众自己创造的新民歌和壁画中可以得到深刻的启示。
    作品中的先进的思想内容要求有和它相适应的优美的艺术形式。毛泽东同志早就指出，我们对文艺的要求是“革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一”。我们不应该满足于粗糙和平淡的形式，我们要“写最新最美的文字，画最新最美的画图”。这就是说，既要有最新的思想又要有最美的形式。许多新民歌就具有这一最新最美的特征。艺术上的提高，决不是向资产阶级的、西洋的陈腐的艺术效颦，而是创造出工人阶级的、民族的优美的风格来。应该向传统学习，向外国学习，但继承传统和学习外国，都只是为了有所借镜，目的是创造具有我国民族特色的社会主义的、共产主义的新文艺。而要创造出这种文艺，我们的文艺工作者必须首先把自己的思想从资产阶级文学贵族的偏见和个人主义的低级趣味中解放出来，打破对各种文艺教条的迷信，努力使自己在思想感情上真正和劳动人民打成一片，向劳动人民学习，学习他们的劳动精神和创造精种。只有这样，我们的作家才有希望写出为人民所需要的作品。
    我们的文艺是为工农兵的，供他们欣赏，也由他们自己来创造。我们的文艺不同于过去任何时代的文艺，它是全民的、群众的文艺，是劳动人民自己的文艺，而不是少数人的文艺。我们正面临一个伟大的群众创造的时代。在文艺上应该积极发展群众创作和群众批评。随着教育和文化的普及，群众的文艺将有更大的发展和繁荣。一方面发动和辅导广大群众自己创作，另一方面应该有更多更好的、适合群众需要的作品输送到群众中去。文艺普及工作是当前头等重要的任务。轻视文艺的普及工作是完全错误的。但是群众要求普及，也要求提高。他们不满足于文艺老是停留在原有水平上。因此在大力普及的同时，应当积极地注意提高。不是脱离群众地关门提高，而是在普及的基础上，和群众一起提高。只要普及，不要提高，或者只要提高不要普及，都是脱离群众的、都是轻视群众和不相信群众的表现。普及第一，普及和提高相结合，这就是我们的方针。要正确地解决普及和提高的关系，关键在于文艺工作者和劳动人民的真正结合。
    在文艺和学术工作上，我们坚持“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策。现在蓬勃发展的群众创作运动和批评运动就是这个政策的体现。我们的任务是在毛泽东同志所提出的六条政治标准的基础上，广泛地团结全体文艺工作者和鼓励各式各样的文艺创作。只要不是毒草，应该允许各种不同思想水平和艺术水平的文艺作品的共同存在和互相竞赛。我们欢迎好作品，但也不怕毒草。毒草既然客观存在，我们就宁愿让它露出头来再锄，以便使更多的人增强识别的能力。
    在艺术创造上，如同在一切事业上一样，我们提倡刻苦钻研的作风，反对粗制滥造的恶习。为了及时地迅速地反映和配合当前的斗争，我们需要更多的短小精悍的作品，同时也需要对某一革命历史阶段或历史事件作较大艺术概括的作品。无论写什么样的作品都应采取严肃认真的态度。每个文艺工作者都应当努力把用自己的心血写成的最好的作品献给劳动人民。
    为了完成上述任务，必须建成一支工人阶级的文艺队伍。经过了反右斗争和整风运动，文艺队伍受到了锻炼，经历了改组的过程，加入了新的血液。现在大批的作家艺术家已经下乡，下厂，下部队，深入到劳动群众中去，他们的初步的收获，证明了党的方针的完全正确。但是决不能满足于已有的成就，必须继续深入，不能浅尝辄止。文艺工作者应该长期生活在工农群众中，参加劳动锻炼和基层工作，在群众的政治斗争和生产斗争中改造自己，并取得创作的源泉。作家艺术家不应以特殊人物自居，应当以普通劳动者的姿态出现，和群众打成一片。目前文艺界提出了减低稿费的要求，是有助于解决这个问题的。我国的文艺家受到党和政府的重视，生活有了保障，已可以不再完全依靠稿费维持生活，稿费只是一种对创作的奖励。过高的稿酬，只会造成作家和劳动群众的距离，并且助长一些人的名利思想。文艺工作者只有从思想感情到生活方式都和劳动人民没有距离，才能创造出适合于群众要求的作品。只要坚持文艺工作者和劳动人民相结合、文艺为劳动人民服务的正确方针，依靠党，依靠群众，文艺的园地上必将进一步地出现百花齐放、万紫千红的新局面。让我们用百倍千倍的干劲，争取文学艺术的更大跃进、更大丰收吧！
