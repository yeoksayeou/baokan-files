Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 13th: U.S. President Eisenhower's televised broadcast on September 11th has deepened the unease of the American public caused by the U.S. military provocations against China.

    The "New York Post," in evaluating the U.S. President's speech, wrote: "The tragedy of the President's speech lies in the fact that it merely repeats all the official policies already announced by Dulles." The newspaper's editorial headline was: "Eisenhower's Face - Dulles' Voice."

    The editorial said that the President did not say anything new, but he only more nakedly emphasized that the United States intends to continue taking various military measures in the Far East, including openly attacking the People's Republic of China. The "New York Post" wrote, "President Eisenhower's speech to the nation on the Far East crisis brought neither encouragement nor comfort." "New York Times" commentator Reston said that the American public remained in the same tense state after the President's speech as before the speech.

    Almost all editorials of American newspapers, even major organs of the ruling Republican Party, expressed varying degrees of panic and unease about Eisenhower's speech. This reflects the mood of the majority of the American people, who oppose the war preparations of those who are enthusiastic about acting as international policemen and clamoring for war against the People's Republic of China for their own selfish interests.

    The "Minneapolis Star" fiercely criticized Eisenhower's speech, emphasizing that "the President's speech is disappointing because it is full of hostile tones, and the President did not provide a comprehensive account of the events that led to the current crisis in the Far East."

    Many newspapers expressed doubt as to whether negotiations between China and the United States on resolving the Far East crisis would be successful if conducted according to the conditions put forward in Eisenhower's speech.

    Some senators and prominent social figures continue to criticize the U.S. government's position in the Taiwan conflict. Senator Green, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a Democrat, said he was "deeply disturbed" by the U.S. Far East policy mentioned in Eisenhower's speech. He believes that the speech "demonstrates a lack of ability to discern the reality of the situation in the Far East." Green and Democratic Senator Humphrey believe that the President has an obligation to convene a special session of Congress before making major decisions on the brink of war. Democratic Senator Mansfield (Montana) said that the President should "study all the potential consequences contained in the current situation, and recognize the possibility that if we wage war for the coastal islands, we will only be able to wage this war alone." Moreover, "this will pit the 175 million people of the United States against a total of 800 million people in Russia and Communist China."

    The large number of letters from the general public to the President and newspaper editors proves that the American people are deeply disturbed by the U.S. government's provocative actions against the People's Republic of China. White House Press Secretary Hagerty admitted that at least half of these letters were severely critical of the current U.S. Far East policy.

    不满意艾森豪威尔重复杜勒斯滥调
    美国国内发出一片嘘声
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社纽约13日讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔9月11日的电视广播演说更加深了美国公众由于美国对中国的军事挑衅引起的不安。
    “纽约邮报”在评价美国总统演说时写道：“总统演说的悲剧在于演说中只是全部重复一遍杜勒斯早已宣布过的官方方针。”这家报纸的社论标题是：“艾森豪威尔的面孔——杜勒斯的声音”。
    社论说，总统并没有说出什么新东西，他只不过是更赤裸裸地强调说，美国打算继续在远东采取包括公开进攻中华人民共和国在内的各种军事措施。“纽约邮报”写道，“艾森豪威尔总统就远东危机问题向全国发表的演说既没有带来鼓舞也没有带来安慰。”“纽约时报”评论员赖斯顿说，美国公众在总统演说之后仍然处于演说之前那种同样紧张的状态之中。
    差不多美国报纸的所有社论，甚至执政的共和党各大机关报，对于艾森豪威尔的演说在不同程度上都表现了惊慌和不安。这反映了大多数美国人民的情绪。他们反对那些热中于担任国际宪兵角色和为了私利叫嚷要对中华人民共和国发动战争的人所进行的备战活动。
    “明尼阿波利斯明星报”猛烈抨击艾森豪威尔的演说，它强调指出，“总统的演说令人失望。因为这篇演说充满了敌意的口吻，同时总统并没有对导致远东目前危机的事件做全面的叙述。”
    许多报纸表示，如果按照艾森豪威尔演说中所提出的条件进行中美关于解决远东危机的谈判，是否会取得成功是值得怀疑的。
    一些参议员和著名的社会人士继续抨击美国政府在台湾冲突中的立场。参议院外交委员会主席、民主党人格林说，他对艾森豪威尔演说中所谈到的美国远东政策感到“深刻不安”。他认为，这篇演说“表明缺乏鉴别远东现实局势的能力。”格林和民主党参议员汉弗莱认为，在作出濒于战争边缘的重大决定之前，总统有义务要召集一次国会特别会议。民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德（蒙大拿州）说，总统应当“研究目前局势所包含的一切潜在的后果，并且要认清这样的可能性：如果我们为了沿海岛屿发动战争，我们将只能单独去进行这场战争。”而且“这将使美国的一亿七千五百万人民同俄国和共产党中国总共八亿人民为敌。”
    在一般群众写给总统和报纸编辑部的大量信件中证明，美国人民对于美国政府对中华人民共和国的挑衅行动深感不安。白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂承认，这些信至少有一半是严厉指责美国现行远东政策的。
