Planting the Red Flag on the Pinnacle of Cutting-Edge Technology
—An Introduction to the Atomic Energy Pavilion at the National Industrial Exhibition
By our staff reporter Lü Xinchu

The atom is the smallest constituent unit of all elements in the world, yet it can emit the greatest energy. In a glass case in the Atomic Energy Pavilion, there is a piece of grayish-black metal, smaller than a sesame flatbread. Judging from its volume, no one would guess that it weighs nearly two kilograms! It is the source of the greatest energy in the world that can be used peacefully today – uranium. The nuclear fission of two kilograms of uranium can release energy equivalent to two thousand tons of high-quality coal!

The more than two hundred exhibits, models, and charts on display in the exhibition hall show visitors that the young New China is rapidly ascending to the pinnacle of world industrial technology, and atomic energy has already been applied in many sectors of our country's peaceful construction.

Atomic Reactors and Accelerators

The working models of atomic reactors and accelerators are the focus of visitors' attention, because they are the two keys to mastering atomic energy. These models are based on our country's first heavy water atomic reactor and cyclotron, built with Soviet technical assistance, as well as the electrostatic accelerator made in China; these real objects are all installed in the Atomic Energy Research Institute. These models use cutaway views and transparent materials to allow visitors to glimpse their internal secrets. The reactor model resembles a short, squat cylindrical pier. From one corner of it, which is vertically cut open, we can see its internal structure. When the reactor is in operation, that is, when the uranium rods placed in the center of the reactor undergo nuclear fission, they release neutrons and gamma rays, which are led out of the reactor through several channels dug in the waist of the reactor for scientific experiments; at the same time, neutrons can strike various elements placed in the "reactor center" through another channel, turning them into radioactive isotopes, which are then taken out of the reactor by special buckets for various peaceful uses.

The exhibition hall also introduces reactors with simple structures and low costs. In the future, various places can build such reactors to carry out the peaceful use and research of atomic energy.

A huge vertical exhibit is rumbling, which means the accelerator model is "working." The function of the accelerator is to scientifically increase the speed of particles. Only such high-speed particles have the power to break through the extremely hard atomic nucleus, so the accelerator is an important scientific instrument for studying the internal secrets of the atomic nucleus. Many newly discovered elements and the recently discovered "antiproton" and "antineutron" were discovered with the help of accelerators. Here is a model of the cyclotron, built with Soviet technical assistance and completed this year on "July 1st," which can increase the energy of particles to 25 million electron volts; there is also a model of the electrostatic accelerator made by our country's Atomic Energy Research Institute after liberation – it can increase the energy of protons (hydrogen ions) to 2.5 million electron volts, which is to accelerate the speed of protons to 22,000 kilometers per second. The design and manufacture of some of its important components have reached the advanced level of similar instruments in the world. In addition to being used for scientific research on atomic nuclei, this type of accelerator can also be used to accelerate electrons and generate X-rays to check for internal flaws in metals. Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary government allocated tens of thousands of U.S. dollars to purchase accelerators from the United States in order to decorate its facade, but this funding only bought some old parts; the nuclear physics laboratory established by the Kuomintang reactionary government for show only had two senior researchers and three assistants, and the monthly funding was only enough to buy some light bulbs and wires. It is truly worlds apart compared to the atomic energy cause of New China now!

The Use of Radioactive Isotopes

The use of radioactive isotopes includes two aspects: one is to directly use the rays they emit – alpha, beta, and gamma rays and neutrons; the other is to use them as "tracer atoms" to understand the internal conditions of objects and the human body. Because their atoms emit rays, people can use instruments to detect where they are and the paths they have taken. For example, if they are mixed into fertilizer, people can use instruments to observe the movement of the fertilizer in the plant through the radioactive rays; if they are placed in the blood, people can use instruments to observe the circulation of blood in the human body. Radioactive isotopes have already been used in many aspects of our country's industrial and agricultural production and medical and health undertakings. The isotope utilization section of the exhibition hall displays a "gamma ray flaw detector" made in China – a huge industrial "cobalt gun" that can detect internal flaws in mechanical parts. In a blast furnace model on display, red lights are installed on the furnace wall and bottom, indicating the presence of radioactive isotopes. By measuring, one can accurately grasp the damage to the furnace wall and bottom, avoid premature or delayed repairs, and increase the utilization rate of the blast furnace. This technology has already been adopted in the experimental blast furnace in Shijingshan, and Angang and Baogang will also adopt it soon. A gamma ray well logging instrument on display here was manufactured by the Ministry of Geology, which can improve the efficiency of geological surveying several times. Our country has already applied this gamma ray well logging method in coal seam exploration. During the Great Leap Forward, the Atomic Energy Research Institute used less than ten days to make a gamma ray relay, which is very sensitive and can be used in the automatic control of coal bin coal levels and other aspects. The audience saw the actual objects and photos of the trial use of this instrument in the Jingxi mining area. Several bottles of "666" samples were made by the Atomic Energy Research Institute after irradiation with radioactive isotopes, so their insecticidal ability is particularly strong, exceeding the "666" powder produced by the United States using this method. The exhibition hall tells visitors that radioactive isotopes have also been used in many other places in our country's industry.

A batch of agricultural crop specimens appeared in the industrial exhibition hall. This is the exhibition section on the application of isotopes in agriculture.

A leaf of a crop is immersed in phosphate fertilizer, and phosphate fertilizer is also found on other leaves – this exhibit shows that plant leaves can also absorb fertilizer. This is a new principle discovered by using tracer atoms. Agricultural model worker Qu Yaoli used this experience to greatly increase cotton production. Tracer atoms can also be used to understand photosynthesis and many other complex agricultural problems. In the past, people could only cultivate improved varieties by hybridization, but now they can use radiation to improve varieties. This picture shows that the new pea varieties obtained by radiation irradiation are not only more vigorous, but also have a 13% increase in grain weight; wheat and oats irradiated with radiation have obtained new varieties that are resistant to drought and rust. A picture shows that the Xingcheng Horticultural Experimental Farm in Northeast China uses X-rays (gamma rays are the same) to irradiate cabbage seeds, which can bolt and mature earlier after sowing, avoiding frost damage; some charts tell us that corn can increase production by 20% after being immersed in radioactive substances. After irradiating field buckwheat with radiation, production can be increased by 10% to 45%. Radiation can also be applied in the storage of agricultural products to prevent germination and spoilage. Here are two pots of potatoes on display. One pot has been irradiated with radiation, and they have been placed for eight or nine months without germination, while the other pot next to it that has not been irradiated has already germinated. After germination, the nutrition is lost and the taste is not good. Some glassware on display contains several agricultural crop pests – rice weevils, grain moths, wheat moths, etc., which have all been killed by radiation. Our country has already begun to study or apply these advanced technologies in agricultural production.

The application of radioactive isotopes in our country's medical cause has brought good news to the sick people. Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences used the radioactive isotope antimony as a tracer atom to study the detoxification problem of drugs for treating schistosomiasis and thus found a good detoxification drug. The General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army used the radioactive isotope iodine to cure eleven cases of hyperthyroidism. The Beijing Tumor Hospital used the radioactive isotope radium to cure hemangiomas and uterine tumors that could not be operated on surgically. The Institute of Dermatology and Venereology used the radioactive isotope phosphorus to make a dressing device for treating skin diseases, which can cure skin diseases. The Medical Device Factory produced a cobalt-60 therapy machine in twenty days, which is a powerful weapon for treating cancer. The exhibition hall displays many photos showing the comparison of these patients before and after treatment with radioactive isotopes, as well as many domestically made radioactive isotope medical and diagnostic devices.

Wonderful Programs in the Microscopic World

A long line of viewers anxiously waited at the entrance of a darkroom, just like vying for tickets to an exciting ball game. Wonderful programs in the microscopic world are being performed in this darkroom. Viewers saw white smoke in a rectangular glass table, some straight and some curved. These are the paths of various invisible rays, called "tracks," just like the white smoke left by jet planes when they fly, so this set of experimental equipment is called a "cloud chamber," and scientists use this device to infer the properties of various rays.

Detection instruments are tools for observing the existence of rays and measuring the properties of rays. The exhibition hall displays many such instruments made in our country, some of which have exceeded international standards. Nuclear emulsion is a special photographic film. When a ray passes through it, it will leave a trace. The shape of the trace can tell the properties of the ray. The main performance of the nuclear emulsion made in our country has exceeded the trump card of capitalist countries – British nuclear emulsion. The "hundred-channel pulse analyzer" successfully made by scientific research institutions during the Great Leap Forward this year can analyze 50,000 times per second, while the one produced by Sunvic Company of the United Kingdom in 1957 can only analyze 1,600 times per second. It has reached the international level.

The exhibition hall introduces the methods of preventing radiation from harming the human body in the atomic energy cause, and displays some protective tools and equipment.

There are many kinds of uranium mines in nature, and more than 150 kinds have been discovered so far. It grows widely in various rocks. Our country is a country with abundant uranium mineral resources. The museum displays dozens of kinds of uranium-containing ores excavated from the motherland and various domestically made equipment for detecting uranium mines. These exciting exhibits make the audience believe that our country has very good conditions for vigorously developing the atomic energy cause.

The Atomic Energy Exhibition Hall tells the audience with powerful facts that atomic energy can only be fully used for peaceful construction under the socialist system. The exhibition hall also tells the audience that the most cutting-edge science and technology like atomic energy are not unfathomable. Like other tasks, it can follow the mass line, can bloom everywhere, and can implement the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results; under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, New China, following the direction of the general line, will surely climb every pinnacle of world industrial technology and science in a short period of time!

    把红旗插上尖端技术的尖端
    ——全国工业展览会原子能馆介绍
    本报记者  吕新初
    原子，是世界上各种元素最小的组成单位，可是它却能够发出最大的能量。在原子能馆的一个玻璃柜里，放着一块比烧饼还要小的灰黑色金属。从它的体积看来，谁也估计不到它竟有将近两市斤重！它就是目前世界上可以和平利用的最大能量的源泉——铀。两市斤铀的原子核分裂开来可以释放出相当于两千吨优质煤的能量！
    展览馆中陈列的二百多件实物、模型和图表，向观众展示了年轻的新中国正在飞登世界工业技术的尖端，原子能已经应用于我国和平建设的不少部门。
    原子反应堆和加速器
    活动的原子反应堆和加速器模型是观众们的注意中心。因为它们是掌握原子能的两把钥匙。这些模型是仿照在苏联技术援助下建成的我国第一座重水型原子反应堆和回旋加速器，以及我国自制的静电加速器做的；这些实物都安装在原子能研究所里。这些模型以解剖的方式和透明材料使观众们能够窥见它们的内脏秘密。反应堆模型像一个粗矮的圆柱桥墩，从它身上被纵剖开的一角，我们看到了它的内部结构。反应堆在运转的时候，也就是放在堆中心的铀棒进行原子核分裂的时候，放出中子和丙种射线，它们经过开凿在反应堆腰部的几个孔道被引出堆外，作科学实验之用；同时，中子可以打击由另一个孔道放入“反应堆中心”的各种元素，使他们变成放射性同位素，再由特制的吊桶把它们取出反应堆作各种和平用途。
    展览馆中又介绍了构造简单、成本较低的反应堆，将来各地都可以建造这样的反应堆进行原子能的和平利用和研究工作。
    有一架直立的巨大展品在隆隆作响，这是加速器模型正在“工作”。加速器的作用是把粒子的运动速度用科学方法提得很高。只有这样高速的粒子才有力量击破坚硬无比的原子核，所以加速器是研究原子核内部秘密的重要科学仪器。近来新发现的许多元素和最近发现的“反质子”和“反中子”，都是靠加速器的帮助发现的。这里有今年“七一”在苏联技术援助下建成的可把粒子的能量提高到二千五百万电子伏的回旋加速器模型；也有我国原子能研究所在解放以后自制的静电加速器的模型——它能把质子（氢离子）的能量提高到二百五十万电子伏，也就是把质子的运动速度加快到每秒二万二千公里。它的某些重要部件的设计制造达到了国际上同类仪器的先进水平。这种类型的加速器除了可作原子核的科学研究外，还可以用来加速电子，产生爱克斯射线来检查金属内部伤痕。解放以前，国民党反动政府为了点缀门面，曾经拨了数万美金向美国购买加速器，结果这笔经费只买来了一点陈旧的零件；国民党反动政府为了装样子而成立的原子核物理实验室，只有两个高级研究员和三个助理人员，每月的经费只够买些灯泡电线，同现在新中国的原子能事业比起来，真是天渊之别了！
    放射性同位素的利用
    放射性同位素的利用，包括两个方面，一是直接利用它们放出的射线——甲、乙、丙种射线和中子；一是利用它们作为“示踪原子”来了解物体和人体内部情况，由于它们的原子能放出射线，所以它们所在的地方和走过的路径，人们都可以用仪器测知，例如把它们渗入肥料中，人们就可以借着放射线而用仪器观测到肥料在植物体内行走的情形；把它们放在血液中，就可以用仪器观测到血液在人体内循环的情况。我国工农业生产和医药卫生事业中已有许多方面应用放射性同位素。展览馆的同位素利用部分陈列的一架我国自制的“丙种射线探伤仪”——一架巨大的工业“钴炮”，可以探测机械零件内部的伤痕。展出的一个高炉模型中炉壁炉底都装着红灯，它们表示放射性同位素的存在。通过测量就可以正确的掌握炉壁炉底破损情况，可避免检修的过早或过迟，提高高炉利用率。这种技术在石景山的实验高炉中已经采用，鞍钢和包钢也即将采用。这里陈列的一架丙种射线测井仪，是地质部制造的，它可以提高地质勘测工作效率好几倍。在煤层勘测工作中我国已经应用这种丙种射线测井法。在大跃进中，原子能研究所用了不到十天的时间制成了丙种射线继电器，它的灵敏度很高，可以用在煤仓煤位的自动控制等各个方面，观众们看到了实物和京西矿区试用这种仪器情形的照片。有几瓶“六六六”的实物样品是原子能研究所利用放射性同位素照射后制成的，所以杀虫能力特别强，已经超过了美国用这种方法所生产的“六六六”药粉。展览馆告诉观众，我国工业中还有其他许多地方也已经应用了放射性同位素。
    在工业展览馆中却出现了一批农作物的标本。这是农业中应用同位素的展览部分。
    一种作物的一片叶子浸在磷肥里，其他的叶子上也发现有磷肥——这一个展品，说明植物叶子也能吸收肥料。这就是利用示踪原子发现的新道理。农业模范曲耀离用这个经验使棉花增产了很多。示踪原子还可以了解光合作用等许多农业上的复杂问题。以前人们只能用杂交的方法培育良种，现在可以用射线改良品种。这张图片显示用射线照射得出的豌豆新品种不但生活力强，而且粒重增加13％；用射线照射过的小麦和燕麦得了抗旱抗锈病的新品种。有一张图片表示东北兴城园艺实验场用爱克斯射线（用丙种射线也是一样）照射白菜种子，播种后可提前抽苔和成熟，免于受冻；一些图表使我们知道：玉米经过放射性物质浸种后能增产20％。用射线照射田间荞麦后，可以增产10％—45％。射线还可以应用在农产品的贮存方面，防止发芽腐烂。这里陈列了两盆马铃薯，一盆是经过射线照射的，它们已经放了八、九个月没有发芽，而旁边另一盆没经照射的已经发了芽，发芽后营养损失，味道也不好。陈列的一些玻璃器皿里放着几种农作物害虫——米象、谷蚕、麦蚕等，它们都是被放射线杀死的。这些农业生产中的先进技术我国都已开始研究或应用。
    放射性同位素在我国医疗事业中的应用，给患病人民带来了福音。中国医学科学院的研究人员利用放射性同位素锑作示踪原子，研究了治血吸虫病药剂的解毒问题，并且因此找到了一种良好的解毒药剂。解放军总医院用放射性同位素碘治愈了十一个甲状腺亢进病。北京肿瘤医院用放射性同位素镭治好了无法作外科手术的血管瘤，以及子宫瘤。皮肤性病研究所用放射性同位素磷制造了一种治皮肤病的敷贴装置，可以治好皮肤病。医疗器械厂以二十天的时间制出了一架钴60治疗器，它是治疗癌症的有力武器。展览馆中陈列着许多显示这些病人用放射线同位素治疗前后的对比情况的照片，以及许多自制的放射性同位素医疗和诊断器械。
    微观世界的精彩节目
    一字长蛇阵的观众焦急地守候在一间暗房的门口，如像争购精彩的球赛票一样。这间暗房中正在表演微观世界的精彩节目。观众们看到一只长方形的玻璃桌子中一条条白色烟雾，有直的，也有曲的，这就是各种看不见的射线走过的路径，叫做“径迹”，就像喷气飞机飞行时留下一线白色烟雾一样，所以这套试验装置被称为“云室”，科学工作者利用这个装置来推测各种射线的性质。
    探测仪器是观察射线的存在和测量射线性质的工具。展览馆里陈列了许多我国自造的这种仪器，其中有些已经超过了国际水平。原子核乳胶是一种特殊的照相底片，射线穿过它的时候就会留下一条痕迹，从痕迹的形状可以知道射线的性质。我国自制的原子核乳胶在主要性能上已超过资本主义国家的王牌——英国核乳胶。科学研究机关在今年大跃进中自制成功的“百道脉冲分析器”，每秒能分析五万次，1957年英国孙威克公司出品的每秒只能分析一千六百次。达到了国际水平。
    展览馆介绍了在原子能事业中防护射线侵害人体的方法，并且陈列了一些防护工具和设备。
    自然界铀矿的种类很多，现已发现的有一百五十多种，它广泛生长在各种岩石中。我国是一个铀矿资源丰富的国家。馆中陈列了数十种从祖国土地中发掘出来的含铀矿石以及各种自制的探测铀矿的设备，这些振奋人心的展品使观众相信：我国大力发展原子能事业是有很好的条件的。
    原子能展览馆以强有力的事实告诉观众：只有在社会主义制度下，原子能才能充分地被用于和平建设。展览馆也告诉观众，像原子能这样的最尖端的科学技术，也不是高深莫测的，它和其他各项工作一样，可以走群众路线，可以遍地开花，可以贯彻多快好省的方针；新中国在英明的共产党的领导下，遵循着总路线的方向，一定会在短期间攀登世界工业技术和科学的每一个尖端！
