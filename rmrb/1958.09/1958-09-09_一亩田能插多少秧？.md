How Many Seedlings Can Be Planted Per Mu of Land?
    Feng Ping

    Editor's Note: Yingde County, Guangdong Province, is conducting highly dense planting experiments. Of the 340,000 mu of late rice, the average is 1.3 million seedlings per mu, and the highest reaches 20 million seedlings. The seedlings are generally growing well now, and the effective tillering ability has been enhanced.

    This is an extremely important experiment, which will provide new experience for further developing dense planting and create conditions for a higher leap forward in agricultural production. At the same time, this kind of dense planting also saves labor compared to transplanting seedlings in clusters. Everyone is very concerned about this issue. We will regularly introduce the highly dense planting experiment in Yingde County for reference by various regions.

    Highly Dense Planting

    The most prominent feature of late rice production in Yingde County, Guangdong this year is highly dense planting. A total of 340,000 mu of late rice was planted throughout the county, with an average of 1.3 million seedlings per mu, of which 38,525 mu reached 1.5 million seedlings or more. There are 56,000 mu of direct seeding, with an average sowing of more than 80 jin. The worst communes planted an average of about 700,000 seedlings per mu. Most of the experimental fields planted 2 million to 3 million seedlings or more, with the highest reaching 10 million to 20 million seedlings.

    The entire process of promoting highly dense planting is a arduous struggle between the two paths of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and "less, slower, worse, and more wasteful" in agricultural production. The conservatives, represented by the upper-middle peasants and some old peasants, defended at every turn, resisted at every step, and tried their best to oppose highly dense planting. Their most common and persistent argument was: "Dense planting yields no good rice," "Dense planting kills rice," and "Dense planting is bound to fail." Some upper-middle peasants even openly incited commune members to engage in household side businesses, saying: "Dense planting is bound to fail. Quickly make some money to save for later, so you don't starve to death in the future." After repeated ideological struggles, highly dense planting was finally realized. This is a victory for the general line of "more, faster, better, and more economical," and also a victory for the revolutionary spirit of the poor peasant class.

    Seedlings Grow Vigorously

    Planting a million seedlings is only a preliminary victory. Only by achieving victory in management work can we ultimately consolidate the victory of the highly dense planting system and most thoroughly defeat the "failure theory" of the upper-middle peasants.

    On August 16th, in order to systematically study and analyze the growth of seedlings after highly dense planting, the county party committee organized seven research groups, each of which included technicians from the agricultural science department, local old peasants, and agricultural consultants from Shantou Prefecture (experienced farmers). They conducted multi-point (five points per group) research and analysis on dense planting fields with 2 million seedlings, 3 million seedlings, 5 million seedlings, 6 million seedlings, 10 million seedlings, and 20 million seedlings. Combined with field observations from various townships, everyone agreed that the vast majority were growing normally and vigorously, and high yields were promising. Only a very small number of individual plots were not growing well (all fields with less than 5 million seedlings were growing well). Some old peasants said after the inspection: "After careful observation of the seedlings, our confidence in high yields has been greatly strengthened."

    The good growth of the seedlings proves that the argument of "dense planting yields no good rice" is unfounded. Seedlings planted with 2 million seedlings per mu are growing very well. Eighteen days after planting, the average height of the seedlings reached 36.72 cm, the highest being 51.18 cm, with an average of 4.5 leaves, and a leaf length of 30.76 cm; the roots and stems are well-developed; the leaf color is dark green, and the growth is as strong as a "rooster's tail"; and it has already begun to tiller. Seedlings planted with 3 million seedlings per mu have an average height of 29.5 cm eighteen days after planting; the average leaf length is 20.81 cm, with an average of 4.2 leaves; and the growth is robust and good. Seedlings planted with 5 million seedlings are also growing normally. Ten days after planting, the average seedling height is 23.9 cm, the average number of leaves is 3.4, and the leaf length is 15.2 cm; the roots and stems are well-developed, with an average of 2.24 roots per seedling. Another field with 5 million seedlings planted thirty days ago has seedlings as high as 100 cm, developing normally, growing robustly, and has already begun to joint (about seven days earlier than in the past with sparse planting). Seedlings planted with 1 million to less than 2 million seedlings have no major differences in growth compared to the past, dark green, robust, and with strong tillering ability. There are also a portion of seedlings, approximately 10%-15%, that are not growing well. Analysis shows that there are generally the following situations: (1) the seedlings were planted late, and those planted after "Liqiu" are turning green or have just turned green; (2) the seedlings are weak, with weak fertilizer absorption and slow growth; (3) there is little base fertilizer, resulting in late greening and affecting growth; (4) weeding was late; (5) excessive drainage and irrigation, causing the roots to lack air and light, resulting in soft feet. Observing the growth of the seedlings, the general trend is: early planting is better, late planting is worse; strong seedlings are better, weak seedlings are worse; more fertilizer is better, less fertilizer is worse; early weeding is better, late weeding is worse. Thus, it can be seen that after highly dense planting, the seedlings can grow well, and what determines it is whether people work hard and whether fertilizer and management can keep up.

    In the fields planted with 8 million seedlings or more per mu to 10 million or 20 million seedlings or more (the highest-yielding experimental fields), many different situations were found: there was a relatively serious phenomenon of excessive growth, with mutual competition for height, long leaves, thin and soft leaves, death of some weak seedlings, and premature jointing of some weak seedlings. According to our observations, the reasons are: (1) although seedlings were selected one by one, there was an uneven distribution of strong and weak seedlings, with more than 95% of long joints or deaths being weak seedlings; (2) light and ventilation conditions were not good enough; (3) drainage and irrigation were excessive, and topdressing was not completely reasonable (not starting with foliar fertilization and strengthening fertilization), resulting in jointing under water and excessive growth competing for light and fertilizer. We believe that this is partly due to the new situation brought about by highly dense planting, but the main reason is a lack of experience and the failure of management conditions to keep up. We are now taking the following measures: (1) draining the "surface water" and properly drying the field to allow sunlight and air to contact the soil and the base of the crops; (2) foliar application of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers, especially strengthening the cultivation of weak seedlings; (3) improving lighting and ventilation conditions. It is estimated that the situation will improve within a few days after these measures are taken. After repeated discussions, we believe that the above situation cannot lead to the conclusion of negating the dense planting of 10 million to 20 million seedlings, but can only be viewed as follows: for the highest density planting of 10 million or 20 million ears, we should study its new situations and problems and study corresponding new measures. We are currently studying this.

    Strong Effective Tillering Ability

    The "dense planting is bound to die" theory is also unfounded. Materials from typical surveys and field observations all prove that after highly dense planting, not only is there no serious death, but as long as the work is done well, tillering can be carried out on a large scale, increasing the number of effective ears. According to more than five typical surveys, there was almost no seedling death with 1 million seedlings planted, the seedling death rate was 1.59% with 2 million seedlings planted, 1.7% with 3 million seedlings planted, and slightly increased with 5 million seedlings planted. This amount of seedling death also occurred in the past with sparse planting of about 150,000 ears. The reasons for seedling death: 60% were caused by broken heads during seedling pulling, 20%-25% were withered heart seedlings caused by rice stem borers, and a small portion died due to injuries during seedling pulling, transportation, and planting. On the contrary, after highly dense planting, the tillering ability of the seedlings is still very strong. In the Hongqi Production Team of the Dazhan Commune in Chengdong Township, more than 100 mu of land planted with 2 million seedlings tillered an average of about 25% within fifteen days after planting, with the highest reaching 28% and the lowest reaching 24%. The 19th Production Team of the same commune, which originally planted 1.2 million to 1.5 million seedlings, generally tillered more than 30%. The Donganzui area of the township, which originally planted 5 million seedlings, also tillered 5%. According to reports from all parts of the county, fields planted earlier have generally tillered about 20%-30%. From the situation in Yingde County, the end of the month is still the effective tillering period. If we do a good job, it is very hopeful and possible to strive for a doubling of effective tillering. Therefore, we have decided to focus on good effective tillering in addition to the main ear in late rice, requiring an average of 2 million to 2.5 million effective ears per mu.

    Of course, the phenomenon of seedling death in the later stage may still occur (sparse planting will also have this situation), and we are studying this issue and the measures that should be taken.

    Fertilizer - The Key to Successful Highly Dense Planting

    The central issue now is the issue of fertilizer, which is the fundamental key to whether highly dense planting can be successfully cultivated. Whether highly dense planting can grow up depends on fertilizer; whether it can tiller depends on whether there is sufficient fertilizer; whether it can head after tillering, and whether it can bear grain after heading also depends on whether there is sufficient fertilizer. According to our field observations, highly dense planting grows new roots one day after planting, and begins to turn green in two or three days. If fertilizer is not applied five days after full greening, the leaf color will begin to turn yellowish-green; after one application of fertilizer (if it is 10 to 15 jin of ammonium sulfate), it will begin to turn yellowish-green again after five or seven days. The importance of fertilizer for highly dense planting can be fully seen from this. We require late rice to achieve "three weedings and eight topdressings," with an average of 3,000 dan of factory fertilizer (including green manure water, artificial urine, etc.), 2,000 jin of soil fertilizer, and 1,500 jin of plant ash per mu, totaling more than 200 jin of nitrogen. Our current fertilizer supply is very insufficient, and we are now doing our best to grasp fertilizer. We believe that the fertilizer problem can be completely solved.

    Eliminating backward seedlings, balancing production, reasonable drainage and irrigation, and preventing and treating diseases and insect pests (especially rice blast) are also very important after highly dense planting, and we are working hard to do these tasks well.

    We plan to organize a more systematic field survey every period of time (ten to fifteen days) in the future, with the participation of technical cadres and old peasants. August 19, 1958

　　一亩田能插多少秧？
    冯平
    编者按　广东省英德县正在进行高度密植试验。三十四万亩晚稻，平均每亩一百三十万苗，最高的达二千万苗。现在禾苗一般生长良好，有效分蘖能力增强。
    这是一项极其重要的试验，这个试验将为进一步发展密植提供新的经验，将为农业生产向更高度跃进创造条件；同时，这种密植也比移苗并丘节省劳力。大家对这个问题都很关心，我们将定期介绍英德县高度密植试验情况，供各地参考。
    高度密植
    广东英德县今年晚稻生产最突出的特点，就是高度密植。全县晚稻共插秧三十四万亩，平均每亩一百三十万苗，其中达一百五十万苗以上的有三万八千五百二十五亩；直播的有五万六千亩，平均播种八十斤以上；个别最差的社，插秧密度也达到平均每亩七十万苗左右。大部分试验田都是插苗二百万到三百万以上，最高的达一千万到二千万苗。
    整个推行高度密植的过程，都是农业生产“多、快、好、省”和“少、慢、差、费”两条道路的艰苦的斗争过程。以上中农和部分老农为代表的保守派，处处防守、节节抵抗，竭力反对高度密植。他们最普遍和最坚持的论点是：“密植无好禾”、“密植死禾”、“密植一定失败”，有的上中农甚至公开煽动社员赶紧搞家庭副业，说：“密植一定要失收，赶快搞点钱来留后路，免得将来饿死”。经过反复的思想斗争以后，高度密植终于实现了。这是“多、快、好、省”总路线的胜利，也是贫农阶级革命精神的胜利。
    禾苗生长旺盛
    百万苗插下去了，这仅仅是一个初步的胜利。只有在取得管理工作的胜利，才能最终地巩固高度密植制度的胜利，才能最彻底地击破上中农的“失败论”。
    8月16日县委为了系统地研究分析高度密植后禾苗生长的情况，组织了七个研究小组，每个组都包括了农业科的技术员、本地的老农和汕头专区来的农业顾问（有经验的农民），分别对二百万苗、三百万苗、五百万苗、六百万苗、一千万苗、二千万苗等密植田，进行了多点（一个组五个点）研究分析，结合各乡的大田观察，大家一致认为：绝大部分生长正常旺盛，高产有望；长得不好的只是极少数的个别块（五百万苗以下的田全部生长良好）。有的老农在考察后说：“细看了禾苗，高产的信心大大加强了”。
    禾苗生长良好的情况证明：“密植无好禾”的论点是没有根据的。插二百万苗的禾苗生长很好，插后十八天，禾苗平均高度达到36.72公分，最高的有51.18公分，平均4.5片叶，叶长30.76公分；根茎发达；叶色浓绿，生势壮如“鸡公尾”；并且已开始分蘖。插三百万苗的禾苗在插后十八天苗高平均29.5公分；叶长平均20.81公分，平均4.2片叶；生长粗壮良好。插五百万苗的禾苗也长得正常，在插后十天平均苗高23.9公分，平均叶数3.4片，叶长15.2公分；根茎发达，每苗平均2.24条。另一丘插后三十天的五百万苗田，苗高达一百公分，发育正常，生长粗壮，已经开始拔节圆身（比过去疏植提前了约七天左右）。插一百万苗到二百万苗以下的禾苗，生长和过去没有什么重大的区别，浓绿、茁壮，分蘖能力很强。也有一部分大约是10％—15％的禾苗是生长得不够好的，分析起来，大体有如下几种情况：（1）秧苗插迟了，“立秋”后插的正在转青或刚转过青来；（2）秧苗弱，吸肥力弱、生长慢；（3）基肥少，返青迟影响生长；（4）耘田迟了；（5）排灌过深，根部嫌气不透光，有软脚现象。从禾苗生长情况来观察，大体的趋势是：早插的好，迟插的差；秧壮的好，秧弱的差；肥多的好，肥少的差；早耘田的好，迟耘田的差。从而可以看到：高度密植后，禾苗完全可以长好，有决定意义的是人们工作是否努力，肥料和管理工作是否能跟上去。
    在插植一亩八百万苗以上到一千万或二千万苗以上（最高产的试验田）的田里，发现了不少不同的情况：有较严重的陡长现象，互相竞高叶长、叶细而软，部分弱苗死亡，部分弱苗的过早起节等。据我们的观察，原因是：（1）秧苗虽经逐条挑选，但有强弱不均现象，长节或死亡95％以上是弱苗；（2）透光、通风条件不够好；（3）排灌过深和追肥不完全合理（没有一开始就以根外追肥为主和加强加肥），因而多在水下起节和争光争肥陡长。我们认为，这一方面是高度密植带来了新的情况，但最主要原因是没有经验，管理条件没有跟上去。我们现在采取这样的措施：（1）排“地皮水”，适当晒田，让阳光和空气接触土壤和作物的基部；（2）根外追施氮磷钾肥，特别是加强培养弱苗；（3）改进光照和通风条件，估计这样作之后，几天内情况将会好转。经过反复讨论，我们认为上述的情况并不能作出否定一千万苗到二千万苗密植的结论，而只能够这样看：对于一千万或二千万穗的最高度密植，我们应该研究它的新情况和问题，应当研究相适应的新措施。现在我们正在研究中。
    有效分蘖能力强
    “密植必死论”也是没有根据的。典型调查和大田观察的材料都证明：高度密植后，不但没有严重的死亡，而且只要工作做好了，还可以大搞分蘖，增加有效穗。据五个以上的典型调查，插苗一百万的几乎没有死苗，二百万苗的死苗占1.59％，三百万苗的占1.7％，五百万苗的稍见增加一些。这样数量的死苗，就是在过去疏植十五万穗左右的情况下也是有的。死苗的原因：其中60％是因拔秧时断了头死去的，20％—25％是生化螟虫为害的枯心苗，还有一小部分是拔秧、挑送、插秧过程中受伤而死的。相反高度密植以后，禾苗的分蘖能力还是很强的。城东乡大站社红旗生产队一百多亩插二百万苗的田，在插后十五天内平均分蘖25％左右，最高的达28％，最少的达24％。该社第十九生产队原插一百二十万到一百五十万苗的田，一般也分蘖到30％以上。该乡东岸咀片原插五百万苗的田，分蘖也达到5％。全县各地都反映，比较早插的田，一般都已分蘖到20％—30％左右了。从英德县的情况看，现在到月底仍是有效分蘖期，如果我们做好了工作，争取有效分蘖一倍，是大有希望，也是可能作到的。因此，我们决定在晚稻中培养好主穗以外，还狠狠地抓好有效分蘖，要求平均每亩的有效穗达到二百万到二百五十万。
    当然，后期的死苗现象还是可能发生的（疏植会发生这种情况），我们正在研究这个问题和应当采取的措施。
    肥料——高度密植成功的关键
    现在的中心问题，就是肥料的问题，这也是高度密植能否培育成功的根本关键。高度密植后能不能长起来，要靠肥料；能不能分蘖，也要看有没有充足的肥料；分蘖后能不能抽穗，抽穗后能不能结实，也还要看有没有充足的肥料。根据我们田间观察，高度密植一亩，插后一天即长出新根，二、三天即开始回青。全面回青后五天如果不追肥，叶色就开始转为黄绿；追肥一次（如果是十到十五斤硫酸?），五、七天后又开始转为黄绿。肥料对于高度密植的重要，由此完全可以看到。我们要求晚稻做到“三耘（田）八追（肥）”平均一亩要下厂肥三千担（包括绿肥水、人造尿等），土化肥二千斤，草木灰一千五百斤，总合起来，氮素要在二百斤以上。目前我们已有的肥料是很不够的，现在正拼全力来抓好肥料，我们相信肥料问题是完全可以解决的。
    高度密植以后的消灭落后苗，平衡生产，合理排灌，除治病虫害（特别是稻热病）等也很重要，我们正在努力做好这些工作。
    我们准备今后每隔一个时间（十到十五天）组织一次有技术干部和老农参加的比较系统的田间调查。　1958年8月19日
