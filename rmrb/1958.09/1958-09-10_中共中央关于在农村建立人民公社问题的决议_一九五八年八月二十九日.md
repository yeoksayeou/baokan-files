　　The Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas
　　——August 29, 1958

　　I. The People's Commune is an Inevitable Trend of Development. Large-scale comprehensive people's communes have not only emerged, but have also become widespread in some areas. They are developing rapidly in some places, and it is very likely that a high tide of developing people's communes will soon appear throughout the country, with an unstoppable momentum. The main basis for the development of people's communes is the comprehensive and continuous leap forward in agricultural production in our country and the increasingly high political consciousness of the 500 million peasants. After basically defeating the capitalist road economically, politically, and ideologically, we have developed unprecedented large-scale farmland capital construction, creating a new foundation that can basically eliminate water and drought disasters and enable relatively stable development of agricultural production; after overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking and breaking the conventions of agricultural technology measures, a situation of leap-forward development in agricultural production has emerged, with agricultural product output increasing by multiples, several times, ten times, and dozens of times, further promoting the liberation of people's minds; large-scale farmland capital construction and advanced agricultural technology measures require the investment of more labor, and the development of rural industry also requires the transfer of some labor from the agricultural production front. The demand for mechanization and electrification in rural areas of our country has become increasingly urgent; in the struggle for farmland capital construction and striving for good harvests, large-scale cooperation breaking through the boundaries of societies, townships, and counties, and organizing militarization, combat action, and collectivized life have become mass actions, further enhancing the communist consciousness of the 500 million peasants; public canteens, kindergartens, nurseries, sewing groups, barbershops, public bathhouses, homes of happiness, agricultural middle schools, red and expert schools, etc., have led the peasants to a happier collective life, further cultivating and exercising the collectivist thinking of the peasant masses. All of these indicate that the single agricultural production cooperatives of dozens or hundreds of households can no longer meet the requirements of the development of the situation. Under the current situation, establishing people's communes that comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and combine industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, is the basic policy that must be adopted to guide the peasants to accelerate socialist construction, build socialism ahead of schedule, and gradually transition to communism.

　　II. Regarding the organizational scale of the commune, for the time being, it is generally more appropriate to have one commune per township, with about 2,000 households. In some areas with vast township boundaries and sparse population, it can be less than 2,000 households, with several communes per township. In some places, based on natural terrain conditions and the needs of production development, several townships can be merged into one township to form a commune, with about 6,000 or 7,000 households. As for those reaching 10,000 or 20,000 households or more, do not oppose them, but do not actively promote them at present.

　　The further development trend of people's communes may be to form joint communes with the county as the unit. We should now plan the distribution of people's communes with the county as the unit and make reasonable layouts.

　　After the scale of the commune is expanded, due to the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, the management机构 of the commune must also have appropriate division of labor. Under the principle of streamlining the organization and preventing cadres from being divorced from production, establish several departments with division of labor and responsibility. And it is necessary to implement the integration of government and society, the township Party committee is the commune Party committee, and the township people's committee is the commune affairs committee.

　　III. The methods and steps for merging small societies into large societies and transforming them into people's communes. Merging small societies into large societies and transforming them into people's communes is the common demand of the broad masses. The poor and lower-middle peasants firmly support it, and most of the upper-middle peasants also agree. We must rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, fully mobilize the masses, launch a campaign of airing views, debates, and big-character posters, unite the majority of upper-middle peasants who agree to merge into large societies and transform into communes, overcome the wavering of the other part of the upper-middle peasants, expose and defeat the rumors and sabotage of landlords and rich peasants, and enable the broad masses of peasants to merge into large societies and transform into communes on the basis of ideological liberation, consciousness, and willingness, preventing coercion and commandism. In terms of steps, it is of course better to merge into large societies and transform into communes in one go. If it is not possible to do it in one go, it can also be done in two steps. Do not be reluctant or impatient. Each county should first conduct pilot projects and then gradually promote them.

　　Merging into large societies and transforming into communes must be closely integrated with current production. It must not only not affect current production, but also make this movement a huge force to promote a greater leap forward in production. To this end, in the initial stage of merging societies, the method of "the top moves, but the bottom does not" can be adopted. First, the management committee of the large society is jointly elected by the original small societies to set up a framework and unify planning and deployment of work, and the original small societies are changed into farming areas or production teams. The original set of production organization and management system remains temporarily unchanged, and business is conducted as usual. Everything that should be merged and adjusted and the specific problems that should be solved in the merger will be gradually merged, gradually cleared, and gradually solved later to ensure that production is not affected.

　　The size of the society, the speed of merging into large societies and transforming into communes, and the methods and steps are all determined by the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government based on local conditions. However, whether the merger is before or after the autumn harvest or this winter and next spring, the small societies that are prepared to merge should be connected now to discuss together and unify planning for farmland capital construction after the autumn harvest and unify arrangements for various preparations to strive for a greater harvest next year.

　　IV. Several Economic Policy Issues in the Merger of Societies. In the process of merging societies, education should be strengthened to prevent a few societies from developing localism, leaving little or no public accumulation before the merger, and distributing too much and emptying out. However, on the other hand, it must be understood that because the foundations of each agricultural society are different, the public property, internal and external debts, etc., of several societies merged into one large society will not be exactly the same. In the process of merging societies, cadres and the masses should be educated with the spirit of communism, recognize this difference, and do not adopt the method of calculating detailed accounts and finding balance, and do not haggle over small matters.

　　When the people's commune is established, there is no need to rush to deal with the issues of private plots, scattered fruit trees, share funds, etc., nor is it necessary to make a clear written provision once. Generally speaking, private plots may become collectively operated in the merger of societies, scattered fruit trees will temporarily remain private, and will be dealt with later, and share funds, etc., can be delayed for another year or two, and will naturally become public ownership with the development of production, the increase of income, and the improvement of people's awareness.

　　V. On the Issues of the Name, Ownership, and Distribution System of the Society:

　　The large societies are uniformly named people's communes, and there is no need to make them state-owned farms, as farms are not good at including all aspects of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs.

　　After the people's commune is built, do not rush to change the collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. At present, it is better to adopt collective ownership, which can avoid unnecessary troubles in the process of changing ownership. In fact, the collective ownership of the people's commune already contains some components of ownership by the whole people. This ownership by the people will continue to grow in continuous development and gradually replace collective ownership. The transition from collective ownership ownership by the whole people is a process. Some places may be faster and can be completed in three or four years. Some places may be slower and take five or six years or even longer. After the transition to ownership by the whole people, like state-owned industries, its nature is still socialist, each according to his ability, and remuneration according to work. Then, after many years, social products will be extremely abundant, the communist ideological awareness and moral qualities of the entire people will be greatly improved, universal education will be popularized and improved, the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and physical labor left over from the old society that socialism still has to preserve will gradually disappear, the remnants of unequal bourgeois rights that reflect these differences will also gradually disappear, and the state function will only be to deal with the aggression of external enemies, and will no longer play a role internally. At this time, our society will enter the communist era where each does his best and each takes what he needs.

　　After the people's commune is built, there is no need to rush to change the original distribution system, so as not to have an adverse impact on production. It is necessary to proceed from specific conditions. Where conditions are ripe, a wage system can be implemented; where conditions are not yet ripe, the original three-guarantee-one-reward or the system of determining work based on output, etc., which calculates remuneration based on labor days, can be temporarily adopted, and changes can be made after the conditions are ripe.

　　Although the ownership of the people's commune is still collectively owned, and the distribution system, whether it is a wage system or remuneration based on labor days, is still "remuneration according to work" and not "each takes what he needs," the people's commune will be the best organizational form for building socialism and gradually transitioning to communism, and it will develop into the basic unit of the future communist society.

　　VI. Our Current Task is to Build Socialism. The establishment of people's communes is primarily to accelerate the speed of socialist construction, and building socialism is to actively prepare for the transition to communism. It seems that the realization of communism in our country is no longer a distant future matter. We should actively use the form of people's communes to explore a specific path to transition to communism.

　　中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议
　　——一九五八年八月二十九日
    一、人民公社是形势发展的必然趋势。大型的综合性的人民公社不仅已经出现，而且已经在若干地方普遍发展起来，有的地方发展得很快，很可能不久就会在全国范围内出现一个发展人民公社的高潮，且有不可阻挡之势。人民公社发展的主要基础是我国农业生产全面的不断的跃进和五亿农民愈来愈高的政治觉悟。在经济上、政治上、思想上基本上战胜了资本主义道路之后，发展了空前规模的农田基本建设，创造了可以基本上免除水旱灾害、使农业生产比较稳定发展的新的基础；在克服右倾保守思想，打破了农业技术措施的常规之后，出现了农业生产飞跃发展的形势，农产品产量成倍、几倍、十几倍、几十倍地增长，更加促进了人们的思想解放；大规模的农田基本建设和先进的农业技术措施，要求投入更多的劳动力，农村工业的发展也要求从农业生产战线上转移一部分劳动力，我国农村实现机械化、电气化的要求已愈来愈迫切；在农田基本建设和争取丰收的斗争中，打破社界、乡界、县界的大协作，组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化成为群众性的行动，进一步提高了五亿农民的共产主义觉悟；公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所、缝衣组、理发室、公共浴堂、幸福院、农业中学、红专学校等等，把农民引向了更幸福的集体生活，进一步培养和锻炼着农民群众的集体主义思想。所有这些，都说明几十户、几百户的单一的农业生产合作社已不能适应形势发展的要求。在目前形势下，建立农林牧副渔全面发展、工农商学兵互相结合的人民公社，是指导农民加速社会主义建设，提前建成社会主义并逐步过渡到共产主义所必须采取的基本方针。
    二、社的组织规模，就目前说，一般以一乡一社、两千户左右较为合适。某些乡界辽阔、人烟稀少的地方，可以少于两千户，一乡数社。有的地方根据自然地形条件和生产发展的需要，也可以由数乡并为一乡，组成一社，六、七千户左右。至于达到万户或两万户以上的，也不要去反对，但在目前也不要主动提倡。
    人民公社进一步发展的趋势，有可能以县为单位组成联社。现在就应该对人民公社的分布，以县为单位进行规划，作合理的布局。
    社的规模扩大以后，由于农林牧副渔、工农商学兵综合性的发展，社的管理机构也必须有适当的分工，要在组织精干和干部不脱离生产的原则下，建立若干分工负责的部门。并且要实行政社合一，乡党委就是社党委，乡人民委员会就是社务委员会。
    三、小社并大、转为人民公社的做法和步骤。小社并大，转为人民公社，是当前广大群众的共同要求，贫农、下中农是坚决拥护的，大部分上中农也是赞成的，我们要依靠贫农、下中农，充分发动群众，展开鸣放辩论，团结大部分赞成并大社、转公社的上中农，克服另一部分上中农的动摇，揭穿和击退地主富农的造谣破坏，使广大农民在思想解放自觉自愿的基础上并大社、转公社，防止强迫命令。在步骤上，并大社，转公社，一气呵成当然更好，不能够一气呵成的，也可以分两步走，不要勉强、性急。各县都应先进行试点，然后逐步推广。
    并大社，转公社必须与当前生产密切结合，不仅不能影响当前的生产，而且要使这个运动成为推动生产更大跃进的一个巨大力量。为此，在并社初期可以采取“上动下不动”的方法，首先由原来各小社联合选出大社的管理委员会，搭起架子，统一规划部署工作，把原来的各小社改为耕作区或者生产队，原来的一套生产组织和管理制度暂时不变，照常经营，一切应该合并调整的东西和合并中应该解决的具体问题，以后再逐步合并、逐步清理、逐步解决，以保证生产不受影响。
    社规模的大小，并大社，转公社进度的快慢，以及做法和步骤，都由各省、自治区和直辖市根据当地的情况自行决定。但是，无论在秋前秋后或者今冬明春合并，都应该从现在起，就把准备合并的一些小社串连起来，共同商量，统一规划秋后的农田基本建设，统一安排为争取明年更大丰收的各项准备工作。
    四、并社中的若干经济政策问题。在并社过程中，应该加强教育，防止少数社发展本位主义，在合并前不留或少留公共积累，分多分空。但是，另一方面，又必须了解，由于各个农业社的基础不同，若干社合并成一个大社，他们的公共财产，社内和社外的债务等等，不会是完全相同的，在并社过程中，应该以共产主义的精神去教育干部和群众，承认这种差别，不要采取算细账、找平补齐的办法，不要去斤斤计较小事。
    人民公社建立时，对于自留地、零星果树、股份基金等等问题，不必急于处理，也不必来一次明文规定。一般说，自留地可能在并社中变为集体经营，零星果树暂时仍归私有，过些时候再处理，股份基金等可以再拖一、二年，随着生产的发展、收入的增加和人们觉悟的提高，自然地变为公有。
    五、关于社的名称、所有制和分配制的问题：
    大社统一定名为人民公社，不必搞成国营农场，农场就不好包括工、农、商、学、兵各个方面。
    人民公社建成以后，不要忙于改集体所有制为全民所有制，在目前还是以采用集体所有制为好，这可以避免在改变所有制的过程中发生不必要的麻烦。实际上，人民公社的集体所有制中，就已经包含有若干全民所有制的成分了。这种全民所有制，将在不断发展中继续增长，逐步地代替集体所有制。由集体所有制向全民所有制过渡，是一个过程，有些地方可能较快，三、四年内就可完成，有些地方，可能较慢，需要五、六年或者更长一些的时间。过渡到了全民所有制，如国营工业那样，它的性质还是社会主义的，各尽所能，按劳取酬。然后再经过多少年，社会产品极大地丰富了，全体人民的共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质都极大地提高了，全民教育普及并且提高了，社会主义时期还不得不保存的旧社会遗留下来的工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，都逐步地消失了，反映这些差别的不平等的资产阶级法权的残余，也逐步地消失了，国家职能只是为了对付外部敌人的侵略，对内已经不起作用了，在这种时候，我国社会就将进入各尽所能，各取所需的共产主义时代。
    人民公社建成以后，也不必忙于改变原有的分配制度，以免对生产发生不利的影响。要从具体条件出发，在条件成熟的地方，可以改行工资制；在条件还不成熟的地方，也可以暂时仍然采用原有的三包一奖或者以产定工制等等按劳动日计酬的制度，条件成熟以后再加以改变。
    人民公社虽然所有制仍然是集体所有的，分配制度无论工资制或者按劳动日计酬，也还都是“按劳取酬”，并不是“各取所需”，但是人民公社将是建成社会主义和逐步向共产主义过渡的最好的组织形式，它将发展成为未来共产主义社会的基层单位。
    六、现阶段我们的任务是建设社会主义。建立人民公社首先是为了加快社会主义建设的速度，而建设社会主义是为了过渡到共产主义积极地作好准备。看来，共产主义在我国的实现，已经不是什么遥远将来的事情了，我们应该积极地运用人民公社的形式，摸索出一条过渡到共产主义的具体途径。
