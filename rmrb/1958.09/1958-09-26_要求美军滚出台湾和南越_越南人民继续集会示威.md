Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 25th: The people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam continue to hold rallies, demanding that the U.S. imperialists get out of South Vietnam and Taiwan, and expressing warm support for the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands.

The masses participating in the rallies expressed great anger at the provocative acts of the U.S. imperialists against China. They unanimously stated that they would resolutely turn their anger into practical action to support the Chinese people and the South Vietnamese compatriots.

Le Thanh Nghi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Minister of Industry of Vietnam, said at a meeting of cadres of the Ministry of Industry that the U.S. imperialists' occupation of Taiwan and the creation of tension in the Taiwan Strait is not only an act of aggression against the Chinese people but also threatens the peaceful lives of the Vietnamese people and the people of Southeast Asia. He said, "We fully sympathize with and warmly support the just struggle of the fraternal Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. This sympathy and support must be transformed into practical actions. For all cadres and workers in the Vietnamese industrial sector, this means resolutely learning from the spirit and valuable experience of the Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people, striving to fulfill and overfulfill the 1958 national plan, and at the same time creating conditions for the successful completion of the 1959 national plan."

Tens of thousands of cadres, soldiers, people from all walks of life, and representatives of overseas Chinese in Ha Dong and Son Tay provinces of Vietnam held "Anti-American Aid-China" rallies. During the demonstrations held after the meetings, the masses excitedly shouted: "U.S. imperialists get out of South Vietnam, Taiwan, and the Middle East!"

At rallies in Nam Dinh, Hong Quang, and Vinh Linh districts, the masses present expressed their determination to continue to deepen the anti-American struggle and support their Chinese brothers with practical actions to build a strong socialist North Vietnam.
