The More We Debate, the Clearer Things Become
By Our Reporter

When the Dongfeng People's Commune in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, was established in mid-August, a heated debate erupted in the Xiangrong Agricultural Producers' Cooperative.

Xiangrong Cooperative was the wealthiest of the twenty-four small cooperatives that made up the Dongfeng People's Commune, with the most public accumulation. Its industrial sector alone included twelve enterprises, of which the grain processing factory could earn 15,000 yuan a year; a large-scale breeding farm raised more than seventy sows; and its 2,640 mu of paddy fields could yield more than 660 jin per mu this year. It was for this reason that a few well-to-do middle peasants opposed transferring all public accumulation to the commune. Rich middle peasant cooperative member Shi Wenju said, "We worked hard for all these years to build up this foundation, and now giving it all away like this is clearly a loss. All the sweat from the past few years has been wasted." Middle peasant cooperative member Meng Zhaoxian simply said, "If we are to transfer to the People's Commune, each cooperative should submit a list of assets, with the surplus being drawn out and the deficit made up." The vast majority of cooperative members disagreed with their views, and a great debate ensued.

Xu Dequan, the director of Xiangrong Cooperative, first made a calculation, saying, "One cooperative compared to another, yes, our cooperative is richer; but one small cooperative compared to a whole commune, we stand to gain. The other twenty-three cooperatives have seventy or eighty factories combined. Not counting land and labor, they also have pigs, sheep, ducks, and fruit trees. Our grain processing factory earns 15,000 a year, but the repair factory in Aiguo Cooperative earns more than 30,000! Once merged, we will have a share of everything. Tell me, is the commune richer or is our single cooperative richer? Is joining the commune a loss or a gain? Isn't the matter perfectly clear!"

Xu Dequan's words immediately reminded everyone of the principle that the collective is superior to the individual, and the large collective is superior to the small collective. Everyone then began to debate how Xiangrong Cooperative had become rich. Before cooperativization, Xiangrong Cooperative was a poor place, and the state had to provide relief grain almost every year. Of the village's more than 7,500 mu of cultivated land, one-third was low-lying and suffered from disasters every year. However, neither the individual farming era nor the mutual aid groups had the strength to transform nature, and the elementary cooperative only had more than thirty members, which was still insufficient. In the winter of 1955, the whole village built an advanced cooperative, working hard for fifteen days and nights to dig a fourteen-li-long canal. Together with other water conservancy projects, more than 2,600 mu of low-lying land was transformed into paddy fields and planted with rice. In 1956, each mu of paddy rice yielded more than 400 jin of grain, and Xiangrong Cooperative turned itself around. When the detailed accounts were calculated, the cooperative members could not help but recall that some people had been worried about their own carts and horses when the advanced cooperative was being built, always feeling that they were at a disadvantage. If these rich middle peasants had not joined the advanced cooperative for fear of suffering a loss, wouldn't these people who were afraid of suffering a loss still be unable to eat rice today! As everyone clarified the path to Xiangrong Cooperative's prosperity, the mood of the masses became very excited. Old Mrs. Mou, fifty-eight years old, stood up and asked Meng Zhaoxian, "How did we accumulate our wealth? If it weren't for the Party leading us to take the road of cooperativization, would we have what we have today! Now that our lives are a little better, you complain that others are poor!"

"Can we achieve a great leap forward in production just by having a lot of public accumulation and a solid foundation?" In the continuing debate, the cooperative members revealed many facts showing that having wealth alone could not accomplish everything. A larger collective and new forms of production were needed to meet the demands of the great leap forward in production. Liu Chungui, the captain of the first team, said: Xiangrong Cooperative wanted to buy three tractors this spring, but after arguing about it all spring and summer, they still haven't been bought. The money is there, but even if we bought the machines, we couldn't use them effectively. Because the cooperative is surrounded by mountains on three sides and water on one side, there is no large flat area, and if we bought tractors, they would be idle for half the year. You see, what's the use of just having money?

This great debate raised the awareness of all cooperative members, unified their understanding, and finally, everyone celebrated the establishment of the commune with gongs and drums.

    越辩越明

    当黑龙江省桦川县东风人民公社8月中旬建立的时候，向荣农业生产合作社爆发了一场热烈的争论。
    向荣社是组成东风人民公社二十四个小社中公共积累最多最富的一个，单是工业就有十二处，其中粮米加工厂一年就能收入一万五千元；一处大型牧养场，养七十多口母猪；两千六百四十亩稻田，今年亩产量能达到六百六十多斤。少数富裕中农就因为这个缘故，反对把公共积累全部转归公社。富裕中农社员史文举说：“苦干了这些年才把家底子打下了，现在这样一并，明摆着是吃亏，前几年的汗都白白干了。”中农社员孟兆贤干脆说：“要转人民公社，各社拿出财产清单，多的往外抽，少的补齐。”绝大多数社员不同意他们的看法，于是一场大辩论就展开了。
    向荣社社主任徐德全首先算了个账，他说：“一个比一个，咱社是富些；可一个小社比一个公社，咱们就占了便宜。人家二十三个社，合起来有七、八十个工厂，土地、劳力不算，还有猪、羊、鸭、果树。咱们的粮米加工厂一年收入一万五，爱国社的修配厂一年还收入三万多呢！并到一起咱们就样样有分了。你说，到底是公社富还是咱们一个社富？入公社到底是吃亏，还是占了便宜？事情不明摆着吗！”
    徐德全的一番话一下子就使大家想起了集体胜过个人，大集体胜过小集体的道理。大家紧接着辩论开了向荣社是怎么富起来的。合作化以前，向荣社是个穷地方，差不多年年要国家救济粮食过日子。全村七千五百多亩耕地，三分之一是洼地，年年受灾。但是单干、互助组时代，都没有力量改造自然，初级社也只有三十多户社员，仍然是心有余力不足。1955年冬全村建成一个高级社，苦战十五昼夜，挖出了一条十四里长的大渠，加上其他水利工程，两千六百多亩洼地改成了水田，种上了水稻，1956年每亩水稻收了四百多斤粮食，向荣社就翻身了。细账算到这里，社员不禁想起，建高级社就有一部分人心疼自己那套车马，总觉得吃亏，要是这部分富裕中农为了怕吃亏不入高级社，这部分怕吃亏的人现在还吃不上大米吧！大家辩清了向荣社富裕的道路，群众的情绪很激动。五十八岁的老牟太太站起来，问孟兆贤：“咱们的家底子怎么攒起来的？要不是党领导着咱们走合作化的道路，那能有今天！咱们的日子好点，就嫌别人穷了！”
    “单是公共积累多，底子厚是不是就能生产大跃进？”社员们在继续辩论中揭露出许多事实说明，不是有了财富就能做到一切，要有更大的集体和新的生产形式来满足生产大跃进的要求。一队队长刘春贵说：今年春天向荣社就要买三台拖拉机，吵吵了一春一夏也没有买来。钱是有，就是买了机器发挥不了效能。因为这个社三面靠山、一面临水，没有大片平地，买了拖拉机得半年没有活干。大家看，光有钱有什么用？
    这场大辩论，使全社社员个个提高了觉悟，统一了认识，最后大家敲锣打鼓庆祝公社成立。
