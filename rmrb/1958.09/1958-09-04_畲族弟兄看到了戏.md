　　The She People See a Play
After the Pingyang Yue Opera Troupe of Zhejiang Province heard that the people of Fengyang Township in the minority nationality (She) area had never seen a play, everyone was very motivated and wanted to give a performance to comfort the She people. Because the troupe was not familiar with the road, the secretary of the Fengyang Township Party Committee personally led the way. Under the hot sun, the actors climbed over many high mountains and arrived at a beautiful She village—Fenglou Cooperative. The She brothers, who were busily harvesting early rice, ran to see the play when they heard the sound of gongs and drums, and carried full loads of boiled water for the actors to drink. The troupe performed plays such as "Double Delivery of Fertilizer," "The Storm of a Letter," and "Eliminating the Four Pests." Although the actors' language was difficult to understand, through artistic expression, the She brothers quickly understood the content of the plays. They said: Only under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can farmers in mountainous areas see plays.

　　畲族弟兄看到了戏
    浙江省平阳越剧团听到少数民族（畲族）地区凤阳乡人民从来没有看到过戏的消息后，个个干劲很足，要为畲族人民进行慰问演出。由于剧团不熟悉路，凤阳乡党委书记特地亲自带领。在火热的阳光下，演员们爬过了重重叠叠的高山，到了一座风景优美的畲族村庄——凤楼社。正在紧张地收割早稻的畲族兄弟们，听到了锣鼓声纷纷跑去看戏，并且挑了满担开水给演员们喝。剧团演出了“双送肥”、“一封信的风波”、“除四害”等戏。虽然演员的语言不好懂，但通过艺术表达，使畲族兄弟们很快地领会了戏的内容。他们说：只有在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，山区农民才看得到戏。
