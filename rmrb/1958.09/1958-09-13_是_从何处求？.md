Where Does "Truth" Come From?
　　Zhang Wen
A certain factory decided to build a small blast furnace on its own, but the difficulty was the lack of firebricks. Someone boldly suggested: don't use firebricks, use other building materials instead. This suggestion was opposed by some people: "How can you smelt iron if the blast furnace can't withstand high temperatures? You must be realistic! Don't even think about getting molten iron without firebricks." After being criticized, the proposer did not give up and went to discuss it with the workers. The workers said: "In the past, iron smelting in rural areas did not use firebricks, so we can find a way to replace them." So they studied together, and after several experiments, they came up with a solution: use ordinary blue bricks coated with fire-resistant clay and build them on the furnace wall to replace firebricks in building a small furnace. Now this small furnace is already producing molten iron!

From this incident, we have learned a lesson, which is how to deal with the issue of "seeking truth from facts."

We must never oppose seeking truth from facts. Without this dialectical materialist way of thinking, we cannot have correct thoughts and actions. But what is "seeking truth from facts"? Of the two types of people mentioned above, who is more realistic and who is not realistic enough?

Chairman Mao taught us: "Facts" are all things that exist objectively, "truth" is the internal connection of objective things, that is, the laws, and "seeking" is our research. (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume III, page 801) For industrial production and construction, over the past few years, through learning from others' experiences and summarizing our own experiences, we have learned a lot of knowledge and mastered some laws. Relying on the guidance of these laws, we have achieved great achievements in construction. However, since the emergence of the situation of the Great Leap Forward, it has proved that some of our past knowledge and experience are not completely correct, and a few are not completely applicable today. To take a simple example: the "law" that capital construction must be surveyed first, then designed, and then constructed does not necessarily apply to all capital construction. Some small and medium-sized enterprises not only adopted the construction method of designing while constructing, but even did civil engineering while installing machines; even more, they installed machines to produce before building factories. This is the "truth" sought from today's "facts". Although it cannot be found in the rules of capital construction, it is correct.

"Seeking truth from facts" is the process by which people rely on their understanding of the general laws of the development of things as a guide to understanding the laws of development of specific things. It is endless, not only because objective things are infinitely vast, but also because our understanding of the internal connections of the same thing is constantly developing from low to high and from shallow to deep; also because everything is connected with other things. Therefore, for any specific thing's development laws and experience, in addition to distinguishing whether it is true or false (such as "the speed of agricultural increase can only be slow"), we must also distinguish whether the "truth" is sought from other people's "facts" or from our "facts", from the past "facts" or from today's "facts", from that "fact" or from this "fact", so as to truly rely on existing knowledge and experience as a guide, and seek truth from facts in applying them to solve our current practical problems. For those laws with universal significance, such as "iron-making equipment must be heat-resistant," we must also consider the specific conditions of application: large blast furnaces must be built with firebricks, but small ones do not necessarily have to, because the temperatures they undergo are different.

In order to build more, faster, better, and more economically, we must dare to and diligently "seek" new "truths" from new "facts," and we must also dare to supplement and develop our understanding of the internal connections of anything. In this way, the dialectical materialist way of thinking of "seeking truth from facts" will become our sharp weapon for constantly expanding and deepening our understanding of objective things, and will not be treated by some people as a rope that binds their thinking, thereby distorting its original meaning. We will constantly develop and improve our understanding in the face of new things, and will not lie down and sleep on existing knowledge and experience, and we will find countermeasures in the face of any new difficulties.

### “是”从何处求？

    “是”从何处求？
　　张文
    某厂决定自建一座小炼铁炉，但困难的是没有耐火砖。有人大胆建议：不用耐火砖，用别的建筑材料代替。这个建议遭到一些人的反对：“难道炼铁炉经不起高温能炼出铁来么？你们要实事求是呀！没有耐火砖休想得到铁水。”建议者被批评后并不死心，就去找工人商量。工人说：“过去农村中炼铁也没有用耐火砖，可以想法代替它。”于是他们就一起研究，经过几次试验，得出一个办法：用普通的青砖涂上耐火的粘土，砌在炉壁上就可以代替耐火砖建小炉。现在这座小炉已经流出铁水来了！
    从这件事情中，我们悟出了一点道理，这就是应该怎样来对待“实事求是”的问题。
    我们决不能反对实事求是。离开了这一辩证唯物主义的思想方法，我们就不可能有正确的思想和行动。但是，什么是“实事求是”呢？上面所说的那两种人，是谁更实事求是一些，谁又不够实事求是呢？
    毛主席教导我们说：“实事”就是客观存在着的一切事物，“是”就是客观事物的内部联系，即规律性，“求”就是我们去研究。（毛泽东选集，第三卷第801页）对于工业生产建设，几年来，我们通过学习别人的经验和总结自己的经验，懂得了不少的知识，掌握了一些规律。依靠着这些规律的指导，我们在建设上取得了伟大的成就。但是，全民大跃进的形势出现以来，证明了我们过去的知识和经验中，有一些是不完全正确的，有少数在今天看来是不完全适用的。拿一个简单的例子来说吧：基本建设必须先勘测，后设计，再施工这一项“规律”性的经验就不一定适用于所有的基本建设。有一些中小企业不仅采取了边设计边施工的建设方法，甚至还边搞土木建筑边安装机器；更有先安装机器生产再盖厂房的。这就是从今天的“实事”中求出来的“是”。虽然是基本建设章法中寻找不到的，但它却是正确的。
    “实事求是”就是人们依靠着对于事物发展的一般规律的认识作指导，去认识具体事物的发展规律的过程。它是无穷无尽的，这不仅因为客观事物是无限浩繁的，而且因为我们对同一事物的内部联系的认识，也是不断地由低到高、由浅入深的；还因为任何事物都是同另外的事物联系着的。因此，我们对于任何一项具体事物的发展规律和经验，除去应该辨别它是真的还是假的（例如“农业增产的速度只能是慢慢地”之类）以外，还要辨别它是从别人的“实事”还是从我们的“实事”中求出来的“是”，是从过去的“实事”还是从今天的“实事”中求出来的“是”，是从那一“实事”还是从这一“实事”当中求出来的“是”，以便真正做到依靠现有的知识和经验作指导，实事求是地运用它们，来解决我们今天的实际问题。对于那些具有普遍意义的规律，例如“炼铁设备必须耐高温”之类，也要看具体运用的条件：大炼铁炉是要用耐火砖砌的，小的就不一定，因为两者所经受的温度不同。
    为了多快好省地建设，我们要敢于和勤于从新的“实事”中“求”出新的“是”来，也要敢于补充和发展对于任何事物内部联系的认识。这样，“实事求是”这一辩证唯物主义的思想方法才会成为我们不断扩大和加深认识客观事物的犀利武器，而不致被某些人当作束缚自己思想的绳索以致于歪曲了它的本意，我们才会在新的事物面前不断发展提高我们的认识，而不致躺在现有的知识和经验上睡觉，我们才会在任何新的困难面前找出对策。
