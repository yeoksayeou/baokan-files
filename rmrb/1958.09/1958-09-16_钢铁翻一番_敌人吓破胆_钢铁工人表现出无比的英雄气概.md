Xinhua News Agency, 13th. Steelworkers on the steel production front are enraged by the military provocations of American imperialism. They have put forward magnificent slogans such as "Double steel production, terrify the American imperialists." They also swore an oath to the motherland: In order to fight back against the American aggressors' military provocations, we will complete the arduous task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year.

　　Whether in large-scale steel industrial bases or next to indigenous blast furnaces, a "compete for every second, every ounce counts" campaign to produce steel quickly and produce more steel is unfolding with overwhelming force. Many steel mills have also launched a comprehensive competition movement of "fast blowing, fast steel tapping, fast molten iron pouring, fast ingot transportation, and fast crane operation." Steelworkers say: Producing one more pound of steel adds one more point of strength to strike the American imperialists. We must seize every minute and second, step up production, and let the rushing steel flood the American aggressors. In this battle against aggression, steelworkers have demonstrated unparalleled heroic spirit and soaring enthusiasm. The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, enraged by the American military provocations, are carrying forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism. The No. 1 open hearth furnace in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant was being repaired on the 10th. The open hearth workers wrote to the furnace repair workers, saying that they hoped to fight back against American aggression with practical actions to speed up furnace repair. The furnace repair workers replied that they had already decided to do so. As soon as the open hearth furnace finished tapping steel, when the furnace was still red-hot, the furnace repair workers, wrapped in grass bags soaked with water, bravely climbed into the furnace to move bricks down. In this way, they overcame the high temperature of 1,000 degrees, shortening the repair time by 30 hours compared with the original plan, and can increase production by more than 1,000 tons of steel. On the 9th, the workers of the open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant also jumped into the furnace to carry out overhaul, disregarding the high temperature of 300 to 400 degrees Celsius. They could only stay in the furnace for half a minute or a minute, jump out to rinse with cold water, drink a sip of camphor tincture, and then jump back into the furnace.

　　Steelworkers have achieved significant results and production has surged in this battle to step up production in order to oppose American aggression. The day after the workers of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company held a rally to oppose the war threat of American imperialism (August 8), steel production increased by 200 tons compared with the 7th, and on the 9th, steel production increased by more than 700 tons compared with the 8th. On the wooden sign newly appeared in front of the open hearth furnace of the Second Steel Plant with the words "Produce more steel to fight back against the American imperialists, and cooperate closely to seize every second," the workers' production achievements in the past few days were seen: from the 8th to the 10th, the factory's employees began to overcome many difficulties encountered after expanding the charging capacity, with an average daily increase of more than 390 tons of steel compared with the first few days of September. The ironmaking workers of Anshan Iron and Steel have also created many new achievements in the past few days. In the recent three days, they have produced an average of more than 360 tons of iron per day compared with the first few days of September. The No. 1 blast furnace of No. 1 Plant of Shashi Iron and Steel Company in Hubei Province could only produce 0.8 tons of iron on September 1st. On the same day they heard Premier Zhou's statement, the output increased to 6.4 tons.

　　In the vast rural areas, the number of indigenous blast furnaces has suddenly increased in recent days, and the number of farmers participating in the steel team has also greatly increased. This group of millions of new steelworkers hates American imperialism even more. They are determined to use the molten iron from thousands of indigenous blast furnaces to form a torrent and submerge the American aggressors, so as to defend their peaceful and happy life. In Jiangxi Province, the number of farmers participating in the steel team has surged from more than 190,000 not long ago to more than 760,000 in recent days, and the number of indigenous blast furnaces officially put into production has increased from 1,224 to 2,239. In order to fight back against American aggression with more steel production, an 80,000-strong steel army organized by Yongxin County, regardless of day and night, wind and rain, is waging a war against steel on the mountains and next to the furnaces, so that the daily output of pig iron has surged from less than 21 tons in August to 85 tons. After holding rallies and parades, Suichuan County immediately dispatched an 80,000-strong army to the mountains to make iron, building 800 indigenous blast furnaces in three days, and putting them all into production. On the 9th, the workers of Jinhua Iron Plant in Shaodong County, Hunan Province, created the highest record in the country for indigenous furnace ironmaking, with a daily output of 5,836.5 jin of pig iron.

    钢铁翻一番  敌人吓破胆
    钢铁工人表现出无比的英雄气概
    新华社13日讯　在钢铁生产战线上的工人们，被美帝国主义的军事挑衅激怒起来了。他们提出了“钢铁翻一番，美帝吓破胆”等雄壮的口号。他们还向祖国宣誓：为了反击美国侵略者的军事挑衅，完成今年生产钢铁一千零七十万吨的艰巨任务。
    无论在大型的钢铁工业基地里或土高炉旁，一个“分秒必争、斤两不少”的快出钢、多出钢的竞赛运动正以雷霆万钧之势普遍展开。有许多钢铁厂还展开了“吹炼快、出钢快、铁水倒的快、钢锭运的快、行车跑的快”的全面竞赛运动。钢铁工人们说：多生产一斤钢铁就多一分打击美帝的力量。我们必需抓紧一分一秒的时间，加紧生产，让奔流的钢水淹没美国侵略者。钢铁工人们在这场反侵略的战斗中，表现出无比的英雄气概和冲天的干劲。被美国军事挑衅激怒了的鞍山钢铁公司的工人们正发扬着革命英雄主义的精神。第一炼钢厂一号平炉在10日进行抢修。平炉工人写信给修炉工人说，希望以加快修炉速度的实际行动反击美国的侵略。修炉工人回答说，我们早就这样决定了。当平炉刚刚出完钢，炉膛还是通红的时候，修炉工人就裹着浇上水的草袋，奋勇地爬进炉膛，往下搬砖。他们就这样战胜了一千度的高温，使小修时间比原计划缩短三十个小时，可以增产一千多吨钢。上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间的工人，在9日也奋不顾身地冒着摄氏三、四百度的高温，跳进炉膛进行翻修。他们只能在炉膛里呆半分钟，一分钟，跳出来冲一下冷水，喝一口樟脑酊，又跳进炉膛里去。
    钢铁工人在这场为反对美国侵略而加紧生产的战斗中，已取得了重大成果，产量激增。鞍钢第一炼钢厂的工人们举行集会反对美帝国主义战争威胁的第二天（8日），钢产量就比7日增加了二百吨，9日又比8日增产钢七百多吨。在第二炼钢厂的平炉门前新出现的写有“多产钢反击美帝，大协作分秒必争”字样的木牌上，看到了工人们这几天来的生产成就：从8日到10日这个厂的职工开始战胜了扩大装入量以后所遇到的许多困难，每天平均比9月头几天增产钢三百九十多吨。鞍钢的炼铁职工这几天来也创造了许多新的成就。他们在最近三天中，每天平均比9月份头几天多生产铁三百六十多吨。湖北省沙市钢铁公司第一厂第一号高炉，9月1日还只能生产零点八吨铁，在他们听到周总理声明的当天，产量就增至六点四吨。
    在广大农村中，最近几天土高炉骤然增多，参加钢铁队伍的农民也大为增加。这批千百万的新的钢铁工人更加仇恨美帝国主义，他们决心用千万个土高炉的铁水，汇成巨流，淹没美国侵略者，保卫他们的和平幸福生活。江西省最近几天参加钢铁队伍的农民已由不久前的十九万多人，激增到七十六万多人，正式投入生产的土高炉，已由一千二百二十四座增到二千二百三十九座。为了以多产钢铁回击美国侵略，永新县组成的一支八万人的钢铁大军，不分白天黑夜和风雨，在山上、在炉旁，向钢铁开战，使生铁日产量由8月份的不到二十一吨激增到八十五吨。遂川县在举行集会游行之后，立即有八万大军上山炼铁，在三天内建成了八百座土高炉，并且全部投入生产。湖南省邵东县金华铁厂的工人，在9日创造了日产生铁五千八百三十六斤半的全国土炉炼铁的最高纪录。
