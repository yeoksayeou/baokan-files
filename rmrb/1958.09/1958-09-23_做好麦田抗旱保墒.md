    Do a Good Job of Drought Resistance and Moisture Conservation in Wheat Fields
    The area sown with winter wheat in 1958 will reach 430 million mu, an increase of 70 million mu compared to last year. Ensuring that all wheat fields are fertile, have sufficient moisture, and are sown in a timely manner is the first hurdle in striving for an even greater harvest next year.
    The situation in North China over the years has been that rainfall is scarce before and after winter wheat sowing, and soil moisture is insufficient, affecting the normal sowing of wheat. The drought situation was particularly widespread last autumn. In the north, drought-resistant wheat planting areas accounted for one-third of the sown area. Many areas had missing seedlings and broken rows, and the wheat had "congenital deficiencies." Only through strengthening field management in the later stages was a good harvest obtained. However, if the soil moisture was good during the sowing season and the sowing was timely, a harvest even greater than the current one would definitely have been achieved.
    According to forecasts from the meteorological department this year, rainfall in the Yellow River and Huai River basins this autumn, winter, and next spring may be less than in the same period in previous years. Over the past year, due to the rapid development of water conservancy construction, many areas have basically achieved water conservancy, which is a major guarantee for overcoming drought disasters. However, we should be good at using favorable conditions and making preparations in advance to resist possible droughts.
    Currently, the first important measure for drought prevention and resistance is to do a good job of irrigation before sowing. This is the prerequisite for ensuring timely sowing, full seedlings, and strong plants. To do this work well, first of all, it is necessary to put politics in command, strengthen leadership, vigorously publicize the important role of pre-sowing irrigation and winter irrigation of wheat, and organize the masses to thoroughly irrigate all wheat fields. Secondly, it is necessary to carefully cultivate and ridge the land, open ditches and build ridges, so that the land is flat, the ditches are straight, and the small ridges are short, so as to improve the irrigation effect.
    Third, make overall plans, calculate water accounts, and uniformly allocate water volume to ensure that all wheat fields are "well-fed and well-watered." As a result of deep plowing, close planting, and increased fertilizer application, many areas have proposed indicators of "seven irrigations," "eight irrigations," or even "ten irrigations" or more for wheat fields. This means that the amount and frequency of irrigation for wheat fields will need to be further increased in the future. To this end, it is necessary to promptly inspect and repair existing irrigation facilities and water lifting tools, tap the potential of projects, and strive to complete projects under construction as soon as possible and put them into irrigation to expand the irrigated area.
    In some areas of Northwest and North China, 100 million mu of spring wheat will also be sown next spring. In order to enable spring wheat to be sown in a timely manner, it is also necessary to use autumn and winter leisure water to vigorously carry out fallow land water storage and irrigation, and to carry out timely harrowing and moisture conservation, which can ease the tension of water use in spring and improve the utilization rate of water.

### 做好麦田抗旱保墒

    做好麦田抗旱保墒
    1958年秋播小麦面积将达四亿三千万亩，较去年增加七千万亩。保证全部麦田肥大墒足，适时下种，是争取明年更大丰收的第一关。
    华北地区历年来的情况是：冬小麦播种前后雨量稀少，土壤水分不足，影响小麦的正常播种。去年秋季旱情尤为普遍，北方抗旱种麦面积达到播种面积的三分之一，许多地区缺苗断垅，小麦“先天不足”，经过后期加强田间管理，才获得了丰收；但是，如果播种季节墒情良好，播种适时，肯定会得到比现在更大的丰收。
    根据今年气象部门预测，今年秋、冬和明春，黄河、淮河流域的雨量可能较往年同期减少。一年来，由于水利建设的飞跃发展，不少地区基本实现了水利化，这是战胜干旱灾害的重大保证。但是我们应该善于运用有利条件，对抗御可能发生的干旱预先有所准备。
    在目前来说，防旱抗旱的第一个重要措施，就是做好播前的灌水工作。这是保证小麦适时下种、苗全棵壮的前提。要做好这一工作，首先要政治挂帅，加强领导，大力宣传小麦播前灌水及冬灌的重要作用，组织群众把全部麦田浇透底水。其次要认真整地打畦，开沟筑垅，做到地平沟直，小畦短沟，提高灌溉效果。
    第三，全面规划。计算水账，统一调配水量，以保证全部麦田“吃饱喝足”。由于深耕、密植及增施肥料的结果，许多地区已经提出麦田“七水”“八水”甚至“十水”以上的指标。这就是说，今后麦田灌水量和次数，都需要进一步增加。为此，必须对已有灌溉设施及提水工具等，及时进行检查整修，挖掘工程潜力；对正在施工的工程，力争提早竣工，投入灌溉，扩大浇地面积。
    在西北、华北部分地区，明春还要播种一亿亩的春麦。为使春麦能够适时播种，也必须利用秋冬闲水，大力开展休闲地储水灌溉，并及时进行耙耱保墒，这样可以缓和春季用水紧张的情况，提高水的利用率。
