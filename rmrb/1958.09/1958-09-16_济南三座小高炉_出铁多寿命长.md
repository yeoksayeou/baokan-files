Jinan, September 15th (From our own correspondent) Since being put into operation in early August, the two 3.3 cubic meter small blast furnaces at Jinan Renfeng Textile Factory and the one 3 cubic meter small blast furnace at Jinan Power Plant have consistently produced iron smoothly.

The two small blast furnaces at Renfeng Textile Factory started production on August 9th, with each furnace averaging over three tons of iron per day. The iron is entirely grey cast iron, and it is estimated that they can operate continuously for two to three months without furnace repairs. The characteristics of this factory's small blast furnaces are the adoption of a combination of indigenous and modern methods. The belly and the upper part of the hearth are equipped with cooling water walls, the three tuyeres have cooling equipment, the gas is recovered to heat the hot blast stove, and the top of the furnace is equipped with a charging bell for automatic charging. This factory has gained the following experience in furnace construction and smelting: (1) It is necessary to prevent erosion of the furnace wall in order to ensure the normal production of the small blast furnace. To achieve this, carbonaceous material consisting of 70% coke breeze, 10% hard pitch, 15% graphite, and 5% soft pitch should be fried in a pot to 120 degrees Celsius and hammered onto the furnace wall while hot, with an additional layer of refractory bricks inside to prevent damage to the carbonaceous material during baking and initial firing. This will prevent the occurrence of furnace wall erosion. (2) For the charging ratio, start by adding 100 kilograms of firewood when igniting the furnace, and after it burns, add 400-500 kilograms of coke. After blowing air for half an hour, stop the air and let it burn spontaneously, then add ore, first adding 30 kilograms of coke and 15 kilograms of ore. After 20 batches, continue adding 30 kilograms of coke and 20 kilograms of ore. Subsequently, add 30 kilograms of coke and increase the ore to 25 kilograms, then 35 kilograms, and then increase it according to the situation, up to a maximum of 30:45. After the charge is full, turn on the air, and do not block the taphole. After waiting for more than two hours, slag and iron will flow out, proving that the temperature of the furnace bottom has increased. Then block the taphole, and after waiting for another two hours, tap the iron immediately after the slag flows out. This will prevent the occurrence of furnace bottom solidification. (3) Cooling water must not seep around the bottom of the furnace, otherwise the temperature of the furnace bottom will drop, the molten iron will solidify, and the taphole will not open. The solution is to reinforce the refractory clay around the furnace bottom to maintain the temperature of the furnace bottom, and to prevent cooling water from seeping into the surrounding area of the furnace bottom. (4) Coke and ore particle sizes of 10 to 15 mm melt quickly, and iron can be tapped every hour and a half. (5) It is extremely important to accurately grasp the charging time, promptly explore the burden line, and control the furnace temperature. The charging time is every eight minutes. Each time a charge is added, it is necessary to explore the height of the burden line to prevent it from being too high and blocking the gas port, which can easily cause an explosion; if it is too low, it will damage the normal temperature inside the furnace, easily causing a fire and affecting the furnace temperature.

The small blast furnace at Jinan Power Plant has been operating continuously since it was put into operation on August 1st, and the output has been increasing daily.

This small blast furnace was built according to the drawings of the Central Black Metallurgical Design Institute with slight improvements. In the rapid construction of the furnace, special attention was paid to ensuring quality. The refractory bricks and brick joints in the hearth and belly parts did not exceed 2 mm; the bricks were laid with full mud to ensure that the brick joints were all tightly bonded; and grouting with water was strictly prohibited to ensure the fire resistance of the furnace wall. Attention was also paid to moisture prevention and insulation during furnace construction, and a 250 mm thick layer of slag was filled at the bottom of the furnace as an air layer to prevent moisture absorption and bottom setting. Cooling equipment is an important guarantee for extending the life of small blast furnaces. Considering that the hearth is an important part, the factory adopted external water spray cooling for the belly and hearth, cooling all the way to the taphole of the hearth, and appropriately enlarged the outer diameter of the hearth; in this way, the hearth cools quickly, the hearth erosion is lighter, and it does not affect the temperature of the molten iron. The operation of the small blast furnace at this factory has also established a strict system, strengthened technical management, and ensured normal production.

    济南三座小高炉
    出铁多寿命长
    本报济南15日电　济南仁丰纱厂两座三点三立方公尺的小高炉和济南发电厂的一座三立方公尺的小高炉，从8月上旬投入生产以来，出铁一直正常。
    仁丰纱厂的两座小高炉从8月9日开始投入生产，每个炉子日产量平均三吨以上，完全是灰口铁，预计能连续生产两、三个月不用修炉。这个厂的小高炉的特点是采用土洋结合的办法，炉腹和炉缸的上半部都加冷却水壁，三个进风口有冷却设备，煤气收回烧热风炉，炉顶设料钟，这样就能自动加料。这个厂在建炉和冶炼过程中，得到了如下经验：（一）要防止炉壁侵袭，使小高炉能正常生产。要做到这样，要把炭素材料用焦炭末70％、硬沥青10％、石墨15％、软沥青5％用锅炒到一百二十度，趁热锤捣在炉壁上，内再加一层耐火砖，以防烘炉和初开炉时损坏炭素材料。这样就不会发生炉壁侵袭现象。（二）加料的比数，生火时先加一百公斤木柴，燃烧后再加四、五百公斤焦炭，开风半小时后停风使它自燃，然后再加矿石，先加焦炭三十公斤，矿石十五公斤；加到二十批后，焦炭仍加三十公斤，矿石加二十公斤；随后焦炭加三十公斤，矿石增加到二十五公斤、三十五公斤，然后再根据情况增加，最多时加到三十比四十五；料加满后，接着开风，开风后不堵出铁口，等两个多小时，渣和铁流出来，证明炉底温度提高即堵出铁口，再等两个多小时，出流渣后立即出铁。这样不会发生炉底凝结现象。（三）冷却水不能渗在炉底周围，否则炉底温度下降，铁水凝结，出铁口就打不开。解决的方法是一方面在炉底四周加固耐火土，保持炉底温度，另方面不让冷却水渗入炉底周围。（四）焦炭和矿石的粒度以十至十五米厘熔化的快，每一个半小时即可出一次铁。（五）要掌握准加料时间，及时探索料线，控制炉温是极为重要的。加料时间是八分钟一次，每加一次料要探索料线高低，防止高了堵住煤气口易发生爆炸；低了破坏炉内的正常温度，容易起火，影响炉内温度。
    济南发电厂的小高炉，自8月1日开炉生产至今没有停过炉，产量逐日增加。
    这座小高炉是按照中央黑色冶金设计院的图纸略加改进建起来的。在快速建炉中，特别注意保证质量，炉缸、炉腹部分的耐火砖、砖缝都不超过二公厘；砌砖时打满泥，使砖缝之间能全部紧密结合；严格禁止用水灌浆，保证炉壁的耐火性。在建炉中也注意了防潮和绝热问题，并把炉底底层填了二百五十公厘厚的炉渣作为空气层，以防止吸潮、结底。冷却设备是延长小高炉寿命的重要保证，这个厂在施工中考虑到炉缸是重要部分，便采用了炉腹和炉缸的炉外喷水冷却，一直冷却到炉缸出铁口上，并把炉缸在外径上作了适当放大；这样，炉缸冷却快，炉缸侵蚀也较轻，并不影响铁水的温度。这个厂小高炉的操作也已建立了一套严格的制度，加强了技术管理，保证正常生产。
