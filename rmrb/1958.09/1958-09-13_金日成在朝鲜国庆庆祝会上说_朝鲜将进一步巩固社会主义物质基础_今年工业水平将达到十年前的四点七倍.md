Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang – Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of North Korea, said at the grand meeting in Pyongyang on the evening of the 8th, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, that the Korean working people, galloping on the Chollima towards socialism, will increase the republic's industrial production level to 4.7 times that of ten years ago this year.

In his report at the meeting, Kim Il-sung said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the first truly people's country in Korean history. Its social system has demonstrated its indestructible vitality and superiority in the flames of war and during the period of peaceful construction over the past decade.

Kim Il-sung said that regardless of whether the imperialists such as the United States recognize it or not, the Republic exists as a dignified and independent country and is prospering and developing day by day. The Republic has grown and consolidated with the great support and solidarity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union. He then expressed his gratitude to the Soviet people who liberated and assisted the Korean people, the Chinese people who aided Korea with blood, and the people of the fraternal countries.

Kim Il-sung then described the economic development over the past decade. He said that the Korean people, in the three or four years after the war, made industrial and agricultural production far exceed pre-war levels. He pointed out that the economic construction achievements of the past decade were actually achieved in four or five years due to the destruction of the war. He said that the Korean people are now implementing the first Five-Year Plan. This year, the Republic will produce 8.6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 400,000 tons of steel, more than 450,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, 1.2 million tons of cement, and 120 million meters of cloth. Korea's originally most backward machinery industry has developed to 29 times that of 1946. Korea's aquatic products industry can now produce 500,000 to 600,000 tons of fish annually. Kim Il-sung emphasized that North Korea has completed the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce and the agricultural cooperativization. He said that this year the grain output in northern Korea will reach 3.6 million to 3.7 million tons, an increase of one million tons compared to ten years ago.

Kim Il-sung said that compared with 1949 last year, the national income has doubled, the wages of workers and staff have increased by 1.3 times, and the income of farmers has also increased.

Kim Il-sung emphasized that the system of human exploitation has been eliminated in our society, and the unified solidarity of all the people based on the worker-peasant alliance is more consolidated than ever.

When talking about the broad development prospects of the Republic, Kim Il-sung said that the basic task of the Korean people in socialist construction at present is to rely on the established socialist production relations to carry out the technological transformation of the national economy, further consolidate the material basis of socialist production, and complete the cultural revolution. He said that in the next six or seven years, we must make decisive progress in socialist industrialization. To this end, we must continue to implement the basic line of economic construction that prioritizes the development of heavy industry and, on this basis, simultaneously develops light industry and agriculture.

Kim Il-sung said that in terms of consumer goods production, it is necessary to develop local industries while developing large-scale factories, and to widely use handicraft technology while using modern technology. He said that the June plenary session of the Korean Workers' Party this year decided to launch a nationwide movement to develop the production of food and daily necessities. Today, hundreds of locally-run factories have been built, and the output value of these factories next year will be equivalent to the output value of all enterprises under the Ministry of Light Industry. This is a matter of great significance in industrial development.

Kim Il-sung further put forward magnificent forward-looking goals. He said that in the next six or seven years, the annual output of important industrial products should reach the following levels: 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 25 million tons of coal, 4 million tons of pig iron and granulated iron, 3 million to 3.5 million tons of steel, 1.5 million to 2 million tons of chemical fertilizers, 5 million tons of cement, 500 million meters of cloth, 100,000 tons of sugar, and 1 million tons of fish.

Kim Il-sung emphasized that agricultural production should develop water conservancy and irrigation, and in the next two or three years, 1.4 million chongbo (one chongbo is about 15 mu) out of 2 million chongbo of fields in northern Korea should benefit from irrigation, and the mechanization and electrification of agriculture should be developed to increase the grain output in northern Korea to more than 7 million tons, of which rice should reach 4 million tons.

When talking about implementing the cultural revolution, Kim Il-sung said that an important task in this regard is to comprehensively implement the compulsory secondary education system and raise the cultural level of all working people to the level of primary and junior high schools. He emphasized that the good atmosphere of part-time work and part-time study that has been established in school education is a good atmosphere. He also emphasized the need to develop technical education and carry out health campaigns.

Kim Il-sung said that today the people of South Korea are still under the colonial oppression and exploitation of American imperialism, and all aspects of South Korea's politics, economy, and culture are on the verge of complete bankruptcy. At present, South Korea's industrial production level is only half of what it was during the Japanese rule, and grain output has decreased by 40%. Today, there are more than 4.2 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people in South Korea, as well as hundreds of thousands of stray orphans. The root cause of all the suffering and misfortune of the South Korean people lies in the American imperialists' occupation of South Korea.

Kim Il-sung said that the Chinese People's Volunteers have ended the second batch of withdrawals and will withdraw completely from Korea by the end of this year. However, the American imperialists not only do not withdraw their claws from South Korea, but continue to expand their armaments, transport missile weapons and atomic weapons to South Korea, further aggravating the tense situation in Korea and seriously threatening peace. He said that the American troops no longer have any excuse to continue to stay in South Korea. They must immediately stop provocative actions and get out of South Korea as soon as possible.

Kim Il-sung called on all those who care about the fate of the motherland and hope for national prosperity to launch a resolute struggle against the American imperialists' occupation of South Korea.

Kim Il-sung said that the Republic has been unremittingly fighting for the peaceful reunification of the motherland since the first day of its establishment. In order to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland by the Korean people themselves without foreign interference, the Republic has put forward legitimate and realistic plans and proposals. However, the answer from the Syngman Rhee group and American imperialism was armed aggression and the clamor of "northward advance."

Kim Il-sung emphasized the need to change Syngman Rhee's war policy and traitorous policy to guarantee the basic democratic and freedom rights of the South Korean people, and to implement economic exchanges between North and South Korea to restore South Korea's bankrupt national economy and the impoverished people's lives.

Kim Il-sung pointed out that if the socialist forces in the northern half further grow, and all the patriotic and democratic forces in South Korea unite to carry out the struggle to save the country against the American and Rhee gangs, the peaceful reunification of the motherland will surely be realized.

When talking about the international situation, Kim Il-sung said that the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unbreakable. The Korean people have realized the great power of the principle of proletarian internationalism through their own hard struggle experience. Proletarian internationalism is the foundation of the Republic's foreign policy. The Korean Workers' Party and all the Korean people resolutely oppose the imperialists and revisionists' attempts to slander this principle and undermine all conspiracies to undermine the unity of socialist countries centered on the Soviet Union.

The Korean Workers' Party and the Korean people resolutely condemn the betrayal of the Yugoslav revisionists, who have completely deviated from the principle of proletarian internationalism and flattered and succumbed to the American imperialists. We will strive to further strengthen the friendship and unity with the people of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union in the future.

Kim Il-sung said that the Korean people fully support and support the national liberation struggle of the Arab people, and continue to demand that the American and British aggressor troops immediately withdraw from the Middle East.

Kim Il-sung said that the Republic adheres to the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and will do everything possible to further develop friendly relations with all countries that are willing to establish friendly relations with our country, especially with Asian and African countries that oppose colonialism.

Kim Il-sung finally pointed out that the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and socialism will surely achieve the final victory.

    金日成在朝鲜国庆庆祝会上说
    朝鲜将进一步巩固社会主义物质基础
    今年工业水平将达到十年前的四点七倍
    新华社平壤电  朝鲜内阁首相金日成8日晚上在平壤市庆祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国十周年的大会说，跨上千里马向社会主义奔驰的朝鲜劳动人民今年将使共和国的工业生产水平达到十年前的四点七倍。
    金日成在大会上作的报告中说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是朝鲜历史上第一个真正的人民国家。它的社会制度十年来在战争的火焰中和和平建设时期都显示了它的不可摧毁的生命力和优越性。
    金日成说，不管美国等帝国主义者承认不承认，共和国作为堂堂的独立国家俨然的存在着，并日益繁荣发展。共和国在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的巨大支持和声援下成长和巩固起来了。接着他对解放并且援助了朝鲜人民的苏联人民、以鲜血援助了朝鲜的中国人民以及各兄弟国家人民表示感谢。
    金日成接着叙述了十年来的经济发展。他说，朝鲜人民在战后的三、四年间使工业和农业生产远远超过了战前水平。他指出，十年来的经济建设成就因为中间有战争的破坏，实际上是在四、五年间实现的。他说，现在朝鲜人民正在执行第一个五年计划。今年共和国将生产八十六亿瓩时电力、四十万吨钢、四十五万吨以上的化学肥料、一百二十万吨水泥和一亿二千万公尺的布匹。朝鲜原来最落后的机械工业已经发展到1946年的二十九倍。朝鲜的水产业现在每年能生产五十万吨到六十万吨的鱼。金日成强调说，朝鲜已经完成了私营工商业的社会主义改造和农业合作化。他说今年朝鲜北部的粮食产量将达三百六十万吨到三百七十万吨，比十年前增加了一百万吨。
    金日成说，去年同1949年相比，国民收入增加了一倍，职工的工资增加了一点三倍，农民们的收入也增加了。
    金日成强调说，我们的社会中已经消灭了人剥削人的制度，以工农联盟为基础的全体人民的统一团结比任何时候都巩固了。
    金日成谈到共和国的广阔的发展前景时说，朝鲜人民当前在社会主义建设方面的基本任务是：依靠已经建立的社会主义生产关系，进行人民经济的技术改造，进一步巩固社会主义生产的物质基础，并且要完成文化革命。他说在今后的六、七年内我们在社会主义工业化方面必须要有决定性的前进。为此，今后要继续贯彻优先发展重工业并且以此为基础同时发展轻工业和农业的经济建设基本路线。
    金日成说，在消费品生产方面，必须在发展大规模工厂的同时发展地方工业，在利用现代技术的同时还要广泛利用手工业技术。他说，朝鲜劳动党今年6月全会决定开展全民性运动发展食品和日用品生产。今天已经有数百个地方办的工厂建设起来，这些工厂明年的产值将相当于轻工业省全部企业的产值。这是工业发展上有重大意义的事情。
    金日成进一步提出了宏伟的前进目标。他说，在今后的六、七年内，要使重要的工业产品的年产量达到下面的水平：电力二百亿度、煤炭两千五百万吨、生铁和粒铁四百万吨、钢铁三百到三百五十万吨、化学肥料一百五十到二百万吨、水泥五百万吨、布匹五亿公尺、糖十万吨、鱼类一百万吨。
    金日成强调农业生产要发展水利灌溉，在最近二、三年内使朝鲜北部二百万町步（一町步约合十五市亩）田中有一百四十万町步成为灌溉受益田，另外发展农业的机械化电气化，使朝鲜北部的粮食产量达到七百万吨以上，其中稻谷达到四百万吨。
    金日成在谈到实行文化革命时说，这方面的重要任务是全面实行中等义务教育制，把全体劳动人民的文化程度提高到小学和初中的水平。他强调指出，在学校教育中已经建立起来的边工边读的风气是良好的风气。他还强调要发展技术教育，开展卫生运动。
    金日成说，今天南朝鲜人民仍然处在美帝国主义的殖民压迫和剥削下，南朝鲜政治、经济、文化各方面濒于完全破产的地步。目前南朝鲜的工业生产水平只有日本统治时期的一半，粮食产量减少了40％。今天南朝鲜有四百二十万以上的失业者和半失业者，还有数十万流浪孤儿。南朝鲜人民这一切痛苦和不幸的根源就在于美帝国主义对南朝鲜的强占。
    金日成说，中国人民志愿军已经结束了第二批撤军，将在今年年底以前全部撤出朝鲜。但是美帝国主义不仅不从南朝鲜缩回自己的魔爪，反而继续扩大军备，向南朝鲜运进导弹武器和原子武器，进一步加剧朝鲜的紧张局势，严重地威胁着和平。他说，美国军队再没有任何借口继续留在南朝鲜了。它们必须立即停止挑衅行为，早日滚出南朝鲜。
    金日成号召凡是关心祖国的命运希望民族繁荣的人们都要展开坚决的斗争反对美帝国主义霸占南朝鲜。
    金日成说，共和国从成立的第一天起就不懈地进行和平统一祖国的斗争。共和国在为了不受外国干涉，由朝鲜人民自己实现和平统一祖国，曾经提出了正当而现实的方案和建议。但是李承晚集团和美帝国主义的回答却是武装进攻和“北进”叫嚣。
    金日成强调有必要变更李承晚的战争政策和卖国政策保障南朝鲜人民起码的民主和自由权利，实行南北朝鲜间的经济交流以恢复南朝鲜破产的国民经济和贫困不堪的人民生活。
    金日成指出，如果北半部的社会主义力量进一步成长，南朝鲜所有的爱国民主力量都团结起来进行反对美李匪帮的救国的斗争，祖国的和平统一一定会得到实现。
    金日成在谈到国际局势时说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的统一和团结是牢不可破的。朝鲜人民通过自己的艰苦斗争经验，体会到了无产阶级国际主义原则的伟大力量。无产阶级国际主义是共和国对外政策的基础。朝鲜劳动党和全体朝鲜人民坚决反对帝国主义者和修正主义者企图中伤这一原则，破坏以苏联为中心的社会主义各国团结的一切阴谋。
    朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民坚决斥责南斯拉夫修正主义者完全脱离无产阶级国际主义原则，向美帝国主义者献媚、屈从的背信行为。我们今后将为进一步加强同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民的友谊和团结而努力。
    金日成说，朝鲜人民完全支持和声援阿拉伯人民的民族解放斗争，并且继续要求美英侵略军立即撤出中近东。
    金日成说，共和国坚持不同社会制度的国家之间和平共处的原则，并且为进一步发展同愿意和我国建立友好关系的一切国家，特别是同反对殖民主义的亚非各国的友好关系而尽一切努力。
    金日成最后指出，朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一和社会主义的斗争必将取得最后的胜利。
