　　Politics Takes Command, Technical Revolution Blossoms
    Basic Construction Department of the Ministry of Coal Industry Emphasizes Political and Ideological Work, Taking the Lead
    The Non-Ferrous Metals Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgy Corrects Shortcomings of Neglecting Politics, Catching Up

    This newspaper reports that the Basic Construction Department of the Ministry of Coal Industry, in the technical revolution, first puts politics in command and does a good job in ideological revolution, thus promoting a vigorous technical revolution.

    This department entered the technical revolution in mid-July. At that time, the department leaders believed that the technical revolution cannot be separated from putting politics in command, and that the majority of cadres must understand the important significance of carrying out the technical revolution in state organs, so that the technical revolution can truly be carried out well. Therefore, at the beginning, they used the form of forums to launch great airing of views and great contending of ideas, during which the ideological problems of "condition theory" and "special case theory" of some cadres were exposed. Some non-technical personnel believed that the technical revolution was a matter for technical personnel, and their work could not carry out technical revolution. Some engineering and technical personnel believe that the office is not the front line, and to carry out technical revolution, there is not even a place to experiment.

    On the basis of exposing ideas, a great debate was immediately launched on "Can the office carry out technical revolution?" At the debate, one comrade said: It is not possible to say in general that technical revolution cannot be carried out in the office, some technical units can still carry out technical revolution. No one objected to this opinion. But some people raised another question: Can non-technical units carry out technical revolution? Some people said: No, because it has no technical work, so there is no question of revolution. Most comrades believe that non-technical units can also carry out technical revolution, such as improving working methods, leadership methods, reforming rules and regulations, etc., which are directly or indirectly participating in the technical revolution. Comrades holding the former view believe that reforming rules and regulations and improving leadership methods and working methods are simply unrelated to technical revolution. Comrades holding the latter view said: As long as it can truly promote the technical revolution to move forward, it is considered to be directly or indirectly participating in the technical revolution. How can it be said that they are unrelated? Another comrade supplemented this opinion from the aspect of reforming leadership methods, he said: Because the office is in a leading position, the reform of its leadership methods has a great impact on the technical revolution at the grassroots level, for example: recently, in the technical revolution at the grassroots level, new records are emerging one after another, when promoting these experiences, often whatever the lower level does, it promotes what, which seems fragmented. If we can revolutionize the leadership methods and study, summarize, analyze, and improve all the experiences in a timely manner, so as to obtain several universal laws that should be grasped to accelerate the speed of coal mine basic construction, the role of this to the technical revolution at the grassroots level is really immeasurable. Can it be said that this is not directly participating in the ranks of technical revolution? Comrades from the engineering office cited facts from another perspective to prove that if the central state organs, as the leading organs, do not carry out technical revolution, they will not be able to lead the grassroots units to carry out technical revolution. In the previous period, some engineering and technical personnel from this office went to the mining area, and after the technical revolution was carried out in the mine, production leaped forward, and many small coal washing plants needed to be built. Seeing that they came from the superior leading organs, they asked them for design drawings, but they could not provide them. If they carried out technical revolution, they could produce more and better design drawings. Everyone agreed with these opinions.

    However, at this time, some technical personnel still believe that the office is not the front line, and it is not easy for technical personnel to carry out technical revolution. Most comrades disagree with this opinion, they believe that although the office is not the front line, many engineering and technical personnel have field experience, and they can now go to the field anytime and anywhere.

    At present, after more than a dozen large and small debates, every comrade in the Basic Construction Department of the Ministry of Coal is racking their brains, looking for tricks, and thinking of ways to innovate. As of the end of last month, the entire department has put forward 67 innovation measures. The engineering and technical personnel who originally thought that the office was not the front line and that it was difficult to carry out technical revolution, have all put forward technical innovation projects. The comrades of the secretariat who originally thought that "technical revolution has nothing to do with the secretariat" have all learned to type, and the documents that the department urgently needs to type no longer need to go to the document printing section of the ministry to "queue up".

    This newspaper reports that "to carry out technical revolution, it is also necessary to put politics in command", this is the experience of the Non-Ferrous Metals Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in carrying out technical revolution.

    When the Non-Ferrous Metals Research Institute began to turn to technical revolution and cultural revolution after the victory of rectification, some leading comrades of the offices had a kind of illusion in their thinking, thinking that: technical revolution only needs to bury oneself in professional work, and putting politics in command can be relaxed. Therefore, the questions such as why to carry out technical revolution were not well studied, and they were caught in the circle of specific professional work or even administrative work. Because of insufficient understanding of the great significance of carrying out technical revolution, the enthusiasm of the majority of the masses was great, but there was more hard work and less skillful work, high enthusiasm and poor creativity, so the technical revolution could not be carried out well.

    After discovering this problem, the leaders of the institute attached great importance to it, and from August 23, they carried out a small rectification in the whole institute with the main content of "carrying out technical revolution to offer gifts to the 'Eleventh'" and with the general line as the ideological basis. In the small rectification, they used the forms of great airing of views, great contending of ideas, and big-character posters to launch a great debate on the tendency of not putting politics in command in carrying out technical revolution. In three days, a total of more than 2,500 big-character posters were posted, and more than 20 large and small debates were held. Many people used a large number of concrete facts to illustrate the truth that only by putting politics in command can the technical revolution be carried out well. A comrade from the analysis office said: Without the thought of continuous revolution, the technical revolution cannot be carried out well. He also cited an example of a group in the analysis office, after improving the analysis method, the time for analyzing a certain metal was reduced from five days to one and a half days, if they continued to study and reform, the time could be further shortened, but they developed a sense of complacency and did not want to reform anymore. In the previous period, another group in the office had many and tight tasks, everyone worked overtime every day, but no one wanted to reform the analysis method. He said: The main reason why these two groups did not reform or continue to reform the analysis method is that they did not put politics in command, did not understand the great significance of the technical revolution, and lacked the thought of continuous revolution. Comrades from the supply office used their own experience to illustrate that if politics is not in command, not only can the revolution not be continued, but even the original advanced ideas will take the "downhill road". In the previous period, after criticizing conservative thinking, this office once made great ambitions to ensure that "whatever the business department needs, it will supply", later, in the specific implementation, they encountered difficulties, and they did not educate everyone to overcome the difficulties in time, when the business department came to ask for equipment and materials, they adopted the attitude of "delay if you can delay, push if you can push".

    After understanding the truth that technical revolution must put politics in command, they immediately let the commander return to its position, specifically analyzed the ideological situation of the masses, and based on these ideological situations, deeply discussed the question of whether this unit can carry out technical revolution and how to carry out technical revolution.

    After such an in-depth abstract discussion, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses was rekindled. At present, the technical revolution of the institute to offer gifts to the "Eleventh" has achieved preliminary results. In six days, the whole institute has put forward more than 800 innovation measures. The repair shop, which had not put forward any innovation measures in the original 20 days, put forward more than 200 innovation measures in just two days. One group in the Third Metallurgical Office originally had no confidence in completing three tasks before the "Eleventh", but now it can complete seven tasks before September 25.

### 政治统帅升帐　技术革命开花

　　政治统帅升帐　技术革命开花
    煤炭工业部基本建设司重视政治思想工作一马当先
    冶金部有色金属研究院纠正忽视政治缺点迎头赶上
    本报讯　煤炭工业部基本建设司在技术革命当中，首先政治挂帅，搞好思想革命，因而技术革命蓬勃开展。
    这个司在7月中旬即已转入技术革命，当时，司领导上认为：技术革命离不开政治挂帅，一定要让广大干部懂得在国家机关里搞好技术革命的重要意义，才能真正搞好技术革命。因此，开始时，即以座谈会形式，展开大鸣、大放，在大鸣、大放中，暴露出部分干部存在“条件论”、“特殊论”思想，有些非技术人员认为：技术革命是技术人员的事，自己的工作无法进行技术革命。有些工程技术人员则认为：机关不是现场，要搞技术革命，连个试验地点也没有。
    在暴露思想的基础上，立即展开了“机关究竟能不能开展技术革命”的大辩论。在辩论会上，有一个同志说：不能笼统说机关里不能开展技术革命，有些技术性的单位，还是可以开展技术革命的。这个意见没有人反对。但却有人提出另外一个问题：非技术性的单位能不能开展技术革命呢？有人说：不能，因为它没有技术工作，当然谈不上革命。大多数同志认为：非技术性的单位同样可以开展技术革命，比如改进工作方法、领导方法、改革规章制度等等，就是直接或间接地参加了技术革命。持前一种见解的同志认为：改革规章制度和改进领导方法、工作方法和技术革命简直是风马牛不相及。持后一种见解的同志说：只要能够真正推动技术革命向前发展的，都算是直接或间接参加了技术革命。怎能说是风马牛不相及呢？另一个同志从改革领导方法方面，补充了这个意见，他说：由于机关居于领导地位，它的领导方法的改革，对基层技术革命影响很大，比如：最近基层单位在技术革命当中，新纪录层出不穷，在推广这些经验时，往往下面做一个什么，就推广一个什么，显得零碎。如果我们能在领导方法上来一个革命，把所有这方面的经验，及时加以研究、总结、分析、提高，从而得出加速煤矿基本建设速度问题应该掌握的几个普遍性的规律，这对基层单位技术革命的作用，实在是无法估量的。难道能说这不是直接参加了技术革命的行列吗？工程处的同志从另一个角度举出事实证明作为领导机关的中央国家机关，如果不开展技术革命，就无法领导基层单位进行技术革命的道理。前一时期，这个处有些工程技术人员下矿区去，矿上技术革命开展以后，生产跃进了，需要兴建许多小型选煤厂，看见他们来自上级领导机关，就向他们要设计图纸，可是，他们拿不出来，如果开展技术革命，就可以生产出更多更好的设计图纸。这些意见，大家一致同意。
    但是，这时，还有部分技术人员认为：机关不是现场，技术人员反而不好搞技术革命。大多数同志不同意这个意见，他们认为：机关虽然不是现场，但是，许多工程技术人员都有现场经验，而且现在随时随地都可以下现场。
    目前，煤炭部基本建设司经过大、小十多次的辩论会以后，每一个人都在动脑筋、找窍门、想办法革新。截至上月底止，全司已提出六十七项革新措施。原来认为机关不是现场，搞技术革命有困难的工程技术人员，人人都提出了技术革新项目。原来认为“技术革命与秘书组无关”的秘书组同志已全部学会了打字，司里急需打字的文件，不需再到部文印科去“排队”了。
    本报讯　“开展技术革命，同样必需政治挂帅”，这是冶金工业部有色金属研究院在开展技术革命中的经验。
    有色金属研究院在整风胜利结束，开始转入技术革命和文化革命时，曾有部分室的领导同志思想上产生了一种错觉，认为：技术革命只要埋头钻研业务就行了，政治挂帅可以放松了。因此，对于为什么要开展技术革命等问题没有很好研究，陷入了具体业务工作甚至事务工作的圈子。部分群众由于对开展技术革命的重大意义认识不足，工作干劲虽大，但是，苦干多而巧干不足，积极性高而创造性差，这样，技术革命就不能很好开展。
    该院领导上在发现这个问题以后，非常重视，从8月23日起，在全院进行了一次以“开展技术革命向‘十一’献礼”为主要内容，以总路线为思想基础的小整风。在小整风中，他们通过大鸣、大放、大字报等形式，对于在开展技术革命当中政治不挂帅的倾向展开了大争、大辩。三天内，一共贴出二千五百多张大字报，开了二十多次大、小辩论会。许多人用大量的具体事实，说明只有政治挂了帅，才能搞好技术革命的道理。分析室一个同志说：没有不断革命的思想，就不能搞好技术革命。他还举了分析室一个组做例子，这个组在改进了分析方法以后，分析某种金属的时间由五天减少到一天半，如果继续研究、改革，时间还可缩短，可是他们产生了自满思想，就不想再去改革了。该室另一组前一时期任务又多、又紧，大家每天加班加点，可谁也不想去改革一下分析的方法。他说：这两个组所以没有改革或者继续改革分析方法，主要是没有政治挂帅，不了解技术革命的重大意义，缺乏不断革命的思想。供应室的同志用亲身体会说明：政治不挂帅，不但不能不断革命，连原来的先进思想都要走“下坡路”了。这个室在前一时期批判了保守思想以后，曾经立下宏图大志，保证“业务部门需要什么，就供应什么”，后来，在具体执行当中，碰到了困难，没有及时教育大家克服困难，当业务部门来要设备和材料的时候，他们就采取“能拖就拖，能推就推”的态度。
    在弄通技术革命一定要政治挂帅的道理以后，他们立即让统帅归位，具体分析了群众的思想情况，并根据这些思想情况，深入讨论了本单位究竟能不能开展技术革命？怎样开展技术革命等等问题。
    经过这样深入务虚以后，重新鼓舞起了群众的革命干劲，目前，该院技术革命向“十一”献礼已获得初步成绩。在六天当中，全院已提出各项革新措施八百多项。原来二十多天当中，没有提出一项革新措施的修配厂，在短短的两天中，提出了二百多项革新措施。第三冶金室有一个小组，原来在“十一”以前完成三项任务都没有信心，现在在9月25日以前，就可以完成七项了。
