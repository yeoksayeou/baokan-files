Anshan, September 25th (This newspaper dispatch) — Today, Anshan City held a mass rally of 30,000 workers and staff to mobilize efforts to fulfill and overfulfill this year's target of producing 4.5 million tons of steel.

Li Fuchun, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a report at the meeting. He called on the 110,000 workers and staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex to further emancipate their minds, eliminate superstition, fully utilize their subjective initiative and material potential, vigorously engage in technological revolution, exploit the production potential of a large modern enterprise, and push steel production to a new high tide under the unified leadership of the Party.

In his report, Comrade Li Fuchun said that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and inspired by the General Line, the growth rate of China's industrial and agricultural production this year is unprecedented not only in Chinese history but also in any other country in the world. All previous high-yield agricultural records and many agricultural theories have been overthrown by Chinese farmers. The mysterious view of running industry has also been dispelled. Henan Province, which used to produce only a small amount of indigenous iron, recently smelted 18,000 tons in a single day. These facts show that everything depends on people, depends on whether one dares to think and dares to act. With correct ideas and methods, our cause will develop rapidly, well, and economically; otherwise, it will stagnate slowly, poorly, and wastefully. In the final analysis, whoever has more Communist ideology will create miracles; whoever dares not break with conventions and believes in the old ways will fail.

Comrade Li Fuchun said: This year, the whole country must fulfill and overfulfill the task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel. In this struggle, Anshan Iron and Steel Complex plays a decisive role. The current task of all workers and staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex is to strive to fulfill and overfulfill the target of producing 4.5 million tons of steel. This task is a great leap forward compared to the initial plan of producing 3.49 million tons of steel. Only by completing this new leap forward target can Anshan Iron and Steel Complex avoid falling behind and compete with provinces like Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hebei.

Comrade Li Fuchun emphasized the significance of greatly increasing steel production. He said that to establish a complete industrial system, it is first necessary to solve the problem of industrial raw materials, and the key lies in having sufficient steel. If the steel industry does not develop, the machinery manufacturing industry will have no raw materials, and industry cannot develop. Therefore, the entire Party and all the people must grasp steel production. Only with more steel and more machinery can the industrial hurdle be overcome. Anshan Iron and Steel Complex is the "throne" of the steel marshal and must make greater contributions to the nation's steel production.

Comrade Li Fuchun pointed out that Anshan Iron and Steel Complex has every possibility of fulfilling and overfulfilling this year's target of producing 4.5 million tons of steel. First, Anshan Iron and Steel Complex has 110,000 workers and staff on the steel production front, who are the main force in China's steel production. This force cannot be underestimated. Ignoring the role of people would be a mistake and would turn one into a promoter of regression. Second, the workers and staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex have a relatively good grasp of steelmaking and ironmaking production technology. Third, Anshan Iron and Steel Complex possesses China's first and the world's rare modern production equipment. With such workers, such technology, such equipment, and such abundant raw materials, it is believed that they will be able to launch "satellites" and create miracles. The No. 16 open-hearth furnace of the Second Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex produced a furnace of steel in 5 hours and 40 minutes, and the recent utilization coefficient of 1.669 created by the No. 9 blast furnace of the Ironmaking Plant—aren't these satellites? As long as existing achievements are consolidated and developed, they will surely surpass the whole country. Anshan Iron and Steel Complex is the largest enterprise in the country; the production potential of all large enterprises in the country is very great. The workers and staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex should establish such a style: we must dare to do what others cannot do; we must dare to think what others cannot think. Do not be intimidated by the advanced indicators of other places, do not be intimidated by certain accidents, do not be intimidated by large enterprises and modern technology, and even more do not be intimidated by skeptics and waverers. If one fails once, try a second or third time, and be sure to raise the red flag.

Comrade Li Fuchun said that in order to complete the arduous steel production task, it is necessary to further break with superstition, emancipate the mind, and mobilize the masses more deeply, thoroughly, and widely; it is necessary to vigorously engage in technological revolution; it is necessary to strengthen the unified leadership of the Party Committee. He said that the majority of workers and staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex have broken with superstition and emancipated their minds, but some cadres and technicians have not broken with superstition enough; their minds have not been liberated enough, and they dare not break with conventions. He said that all operating procedures and technical indicators are formulated by people, and they should not be regarded as sacred and inviolable and unchangeable. It would be strange if we, with Communist ideology, dare not change these rigid things. Any advanced experience, any miracle, is created by breaking with conventions, is created by negating the conclusions of predecessors. Believing that all the conclusions of foreigners and predecessors are "unattainable" and unchangeable is the thought of Jia Gui [a character in Peking Opera who represents obsequiousness]. If the thought of Jia Gui is not broken, it is impossible to leap forward, to be a promoter, or to establish a Communist style.

Comrade Li Fuchun said that in order to promote the great leap forward in production, it is necessary to mobilize the 110,000 workers and staff to come up with ideas and suggestions. Every factory, every furnace, and every team should formulate its own plan and actively think of ways to improve production and promote each other. The original design capacity of the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant was 30,000 vehicles per year. After mobilizing the masses and implementing the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" (the two participations are cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management; one reform is reforming rules and regulations; three combinations are the close combination of Party leadership, technical personnel, and the masses), the automobile manufacturing capacity next year can reach 150,000 vehicles. The 110,000 workers and staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex should also have this kind of spirit. If the 110,000 workers and staff are united as one, then there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome and no task that cannot be completed.

Comrade Li Fuchun pointed out that in order to complete the steel production task, it is also necessary to vigorously engage in technological revolution and tap the potential strength of production. Every factory director, every engineering and technical personnel, and every worker should enthusiastically participate in this movement. Give yourself some difficult problems and then use your brains to solve them, so that you can force yourself to improve. He said that to achieve all of the above, it is necessary to act in unison and cooperate under the unified leadership of the Party Committee.

Comrade Li Fuchun finally called on all workers and staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex to go all out, aim high, improve technology, and strive to overfulfill the glorious task of producing 4.5 million tons of steel.

Comrade Li Fuchun's report lasted one and a half hours, and the workers attending the meeting warmly applauded his report.

After the report, Comrade Zhao Min, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC, made a brief speech. He said that Comrade Li Fuchun's instructions greatly inspired all the workers and staff of Anshan and pointed out the path and provided weapons for how to complete the task of 4.5 million tons of steel. He called on all workers and staff in the city to widely discuss Comrade Fuchun's report, launch a great airing of views, great contending, and great debate, emancipate their minds, and break with superstition. He finally guaranteed on behalf of all the workers and staff in the city to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: We must complete and overfulfill this year's steel production task of 4.5 million tons.

    预祝为1070万吨钢而战的主力军早奏凯歌
    鞍钢立志夺取450万吨钢
    富春同志勉励钢都职工说：谁有更多的共产主义思想，谁就会创造奇迹
    本报鞍山25日电  鞍山市今天举行了三万职工群众的大会，动员为完成和超额完成今年生产四百五十万吨钢的任务而奋斗。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李富春同志在会上作了报告。他号召鞍钢十一万职工在党的统一领导下，进一步解放思想，破除迷信，充分发挥主观能动性和物资潜力，大闹技术革命，发挥现代化大企业的生产潜力，把钢铁生产推向一个新的高潮。
    李富春同志在报告中说在党中央的领导下和总路线的鼓舞下，我国工农业生产今年增长的速度，不仅中国历史上没有，世界上任何国家也是没有的。过去所有的农业高产纪录和许多农业学说，都被中国农民推翻了。办工业的神秘观点，也被破除了。河南省过去只生产数量不多的土铁，不久前一天就炼了一万八千吨。这些事实，说明了任何事情都决定于人。决定于敢想不敢想和敢干不敢干。两种思想，两种方法，有了正确的思想和方法，我们的事业就会多快好省地向前发展，否则就会少慢差费地停滞不前。归根到底，谁有更多的共产主义思想，谁就会创造奇迹；谁不敢打破常规，迷信老一套，谁就要失败。”
    李富春同志说：今年全国要完成和超额完成生产一千零七十万吨钢的任务，在这一斗争中，鞍钢起着决定性的作用。鞍钢全体职工当前的任务就是为完成和超额完成生产四百五十万吨钢而奋斗。这个任务，比起年初制订的生产三百四十九万吨钢的计划是一个大跃进。鞍钢只有完成了这个新的跃进指标，才可以不落人后，才可以同河南、四川、贵州和河北等省比一比，赛一赛。
    李富春同志强调指出大量增产钢铁的意义。他说，要建立完整的工业体系，首先要解决工业原料，而关键又在于有足够的钢铁。如果钢铁工业不发展，机械制造就没有原材料，工业就不能发展。所以全党全民都要抓钢铁。要有更多的钢铁，更多的机械，工业这一关才能过去。鞍钢是钢铁元帅的“宝座”，必须为全国的钢铁生产作出更大的贡献。
    李富春同志指出：鞍钢完全有可能完成和超额完成今年生产四百五十万吨钢的任务。第一，鞍钢有十一万钢铁生产战线的职工，这是我国钢铁生产的主力军。这支力量是不容轻视的。忽视了人的作用，就会犯错误，就要变成促退派。第二，鞍钢职工比较熟练地掌握了炼钢炼铁的生产技术。第三，鞍钢拥有中国第一、世界少有的现代化生产设备。有这样的工人，有这样的技术，有这样的设备，又有丰富的原料，相信一定能够放“卫星”，创奇迹。鞍钢第二炼钢厂十六号平炉用五点四十分钟炼出一炉钢，炼铁厂九号高炉最近创造的利用系数一点六六九的成绩，这不都是卫星吗？只要巩固已有成绩，发展下去，就一定能够超过全国。鞍钢是全国最大的企业；全国一切大企业的生产潜力都是很大的。鞍钢职工应该树立这样的风格：别人做不到的事，我们要敢于做；别人想不到的，我们要敢于想。既不要被其他地方的先进指标吓倒，不要被某些事故吓倒，也不要被庞大的企业和现代化的技术所吓倒，更不要被怀疑派、动摇派所吓倒。一次失败，再来第二次、第三次，一定要把红旗插起来。
    李富春同志说，为了完成艰巨的钢铁生产任务，就要进一步破除迷信，解放思想；要更深更透更广地把群众发动起来；要大闹技术革命；要加强党委的统一领导。他说，鞍钢的多数职工破除了迷信，解放了思想，但是还有少数干部和技术人员的迷信破得不够；思想解放得不够，不敢打破常规。他说，所有的操作规程、技术指标，都是人订的，不要把它们当作神圣不可侵犯，不能改动。我们有共产主义思想的人，不敢改动这些死东西，那就奇怪了。任何先进经验，任何奇迹，都是在打破常规的情况下创造出来的，都是否定前人的结论后创造出来的，认为外国的和前人的一切结论是“高不可攀”，不能改动，那就是贾桂思想。贾桂思想不打破，要跃进，要当促进派，要树立共产主义风格，是不可能的。
    李富春同志说，为了推动生产大跃进，必须把十一万职工动员起来，个个想办法，人人出主意。要使每个工厂、每座炉子和每个班组都订出自己的计划，都积极想办法提高生产，相互促进。长春第一汽车制造厂原设计年产汽车三万辆，经过发动群众，实行两参一改三结合（两参是干部参加劳动、工人参加管理；一改是改革规章制度；三结合是党的领导、技术人员和群众密切结合），明年的汽车制造能力就可以达到十五万辆。鞍钢十一万职工也应当有这种气派。十一万职工变成一条心，那就没有什么困难不能够克服，没有什么任务不能够完成。
    李富春同志指出，为了完成钢的生产任务，还必须大闹技术革命，发挥生产的潜在力量。每一个厂长，每一个工程技术人员，每一个工人，都应该热烈地投入这个运动。自己给自己出一些难题，然后动脑筋去解决它，这样就能逼使自己进步。他说，要作到上面所说的一切，就要在党委统一领导下，一致行动，分工协作。
    李富春同志最后号召鞍钢全体职工必须鼓足干劲、力争上游、提高技术，为超额完成四百五十万吨钢这个光荣任务而奋斗。
    李富春同志的报告历时一小时半，到会职工热烈鼓掌欢迎他的报告。
    报告结束后，中共鞍山市委书记赵敏同志作了简短的讲话。他说，李富春同志的指示，给鞍山全体职工很大鼓舞，为如何完成四百五十万吨钢的任务指出了道路和提供了武器。他号召全市职工广泛讨论富春同志的报告，并展开大鸣大放大争大辩，解放思想，破除迷信。他最后代表全市职工向党中央和毛主席保证：一定要完成和超额完成今年四百五十万吨钢的生产任务。
