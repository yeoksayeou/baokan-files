Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 26th: American social activist Eleanor Roosevelt said at a press conference in Moscow on the 25th that the Soviet people, like the American people, do not want a terrible war. However, the Soviet people understand war better than the American people, so it is clear that their hatred of war is even greater.

Mrs. Roosevelt led a delegation from the American United Nations Association to visit the Soviet Union.

She also said at the press conference that it is beneficial for Americans to see Soviet life firsthand. Recently, the number of American travelers to the Soviet Union has greatly increased. But unfortunately, some of them just don't see the reality of the Soviet Union no matter how much they look.

Mrs. Roosevelt asked reporters to report the true situation of the Soviet Union and what the Soviet people are thinking to the American people. She said this would be a beneficial thing.

On the same day, Yekaterina Furtseva, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, met with Mrs. Roosevelt.

    罗斯福夫人在莫斯科说
    苏联人民不希望战争
    新华社26日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：美国社会活动家罗斯福夫人25日在莫斯科举行的一次记者招待会上说，苏联人民同美国人民一样是不希望可怕的战争的。但是，苏联人民比美国人民更了解战争，因此很显然他们对战争的仇恨更大。
    罗斯福夫人是率领美国联合国协会代表团到苏联访问的。
    她在记者招待会上还说，亲眼来看一看苏联的生活对美国人是有好处的。最近以来，美国到苏联的旅行者大大增加了。但是遗憾的是，其中有的人看来看去就是没有看到苏联的真实情况。
  罗斯福夫人要求记者们把苏联的真实情况和苏联人民所想的事情报道给美国人民。她说，这将是一件有益的事情。
    在同一天，苏共中央主席团委员福尔采娃接见了罗斯福夫人。
