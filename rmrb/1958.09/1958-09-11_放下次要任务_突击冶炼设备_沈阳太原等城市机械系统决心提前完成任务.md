Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Amidst the roar of the entire nation denouncing American aggression, workers in the mechanical systems of Shenyang, Taiyuan, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and many other cities are responding to the military provocations of imperialists in the Taiwan Strait region with practical actions to accelerate the manufacture of smelting equipment and ensure increased steel production.

The workers in various factories in Shenyang City that are manufacturing smelting equipment have put forward the slogan "Not one less machine, not one ton less; not one moment of delay." They have decided to deliver 2,000 blowers and six iron smelting furnaces, supporting various steel bases, five days ahead of schedule, before the end of October. In Taiyuan, leading cadres and workers from many machine factories have moved their luggage to the workshops and are working hard day and night. The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory has formed a "Steel Character Command Headquarters" composed of the factory director, Party committee secretary, and chief engineer. They have readjusted their plans and decided to concentrate on producing metallurgical equipment in September and October. More than 60,000 mechanical workers in Chongqing City are tasked with manufacturing more than 1,000 iron smelting equipment for various special districts in Sichuan Province in September, more than double the output in August. Various steel smelting equipment produced by the factories to support other provinces in the Southwest are also being transported outwards in a steady stream.

The broad masses of workers clearly recognize that producing one more ton of steel means one more ounce of strength. Therefore, they are racing against time in the manufacture of smelting equipment. All municipal factories in Guangzhou City that manufacture this equipment have taken emergency measures. While concentrating all their efforts on manufacturing smelting equipment, the workers of the First Heavy Machinery Factory are also intensifying the installation of six three-ton converters and three twelve-ton cupola furnaces, striving to put them into production in mid-September. All factories and handicraft cooperatives in various districts of the city that can manufacture metallurgical equipment have been put on this task. In order to accelerate the manufacture of smelting equipment, the workers of various machinery factories in Nanchang City are carrying out a mass technical innovation movement of "everyone contributes, everyone offers ideas." Thanks to the launch of the technical innovation movement, the mechanical system workers in cities within the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have manufactured more than 90 converters of various sizes in just a few days.

Many regions have adopted the method of "stopping other tasks to make way" in the rush to manufacture smelting equipment, setting aside secondary tasks and concentrating their efforts on launching a sudden attack on smelting equipment first. In order to meet the needs of manufacturing smelting equipment, some factories in Wuxi City have stopped some of their own secondary tasks, sending some equipment to fraternal factories to support them in manufacturing smelting equipment. The ten steelmaking converters with an annual output of 250,000 tons undertaken by the Hohhot Machinery Factory in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were originally scheduled to leave the factory at the end of September, but now they will be completed half a month ahead of schedule.

In the struggle to rush the manufacture of smelting equipment, mechanical factories in various places have received tremendous support from steel and other departments. The steel rolling workers of Anshan Iron and Steel concentrated their main forces and worked hard day and night to ensure the rapid rolling of steel for the manufacture of smelting equipment nationwide.

### 放下次要任务　突击冶炼设备  沈阳太原等城市机械系统决心提前完成任务

    放下次要任务　突击冶炼设备
    沈阳太原等城市机械系统决心提前完成任务
    据新华社10日讯　沈阳、太原、重庆、广州以及其他许多城市的机械系统的职工，在全民声讨美国侵略的怒吼声中，正以加快制造冶炼设备、保证增加钢铁的实际行动，回击帝国主义者在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅。
    沈阳市正在制造冶炼设备的各厂职工，提出“一台一吨不能少，一时一刻不拖延”的口号。他们决定提前五天在10月底以前，交出支援各个钢铁基地的二千台鼓风机和六座炼铁炉。在太原，许多机器厂的领导干部和职工已把行李搬到车间日夜苦战。太原矿山机器厂由厂长、党委书记、总工程师等组成了
  “钢字统帅部”，他们重新调整计划，决定在9、10两月集中生产冶金设备。重庆市六万多名机械工人，9月份要为四川省各专区制造炼铁设备一千多台，比8月的产量增加了一倍以上。各厂为支援西南其他省份而生产的各种钢铁冶炼设备，也在源源外运中。
    广大职工清楚地认识到增产一吨钢铁就多一份力量，因此在制造冶炼设备方面作到了分秒必争。广州市所有市属制造这种设备的工厂都已采取了紧急措施。第一重型机器厂职工在集中一切力量赶制冶炼设备的同时，自己还在加紧安装六座三吨转炉、三座十二吨冲天炉，力争在9月中旬投入生产。全市各区凡是可以制造冶金设备的工厂和手工业合作社都已投入了这一任务。南昌市各机械厂职工为了加速冶炼设备的制造，正在开展着一个“人人出力，个个献计”的群众性的技术革新运动。广西僮族自治区所属城市的机械系统职工，由于开展了技术革新运动，在短短的几天里就制成了大小各型转炉九十多座。
    许多地区在赶制冶炼设备中都采取了“停车让路”的办法，放下次要的任务，集中力量首先突击冶炼设备。无锡市有些工厂为了满足制造冶炼设备的需要，曾经停下本厂的一些次要任务，把部分设备送给兄弟工厂，支援他们制造冶炼设备。内蒙古自治区呼和浩特机械厂承制的年产二十五万吨的十座炼钢转炉，原计划9月末出厂，现在要提前半个月完成。
    各地机械厂在赶制冶炼设备的斗争中，得到了钢铁和其他部门的巨大支援。鞍钢轧钢职工集中了主要力量，日夜苦干，保证迅速轧制出供全国制造冶炼设备的钢材。
