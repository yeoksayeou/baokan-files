Xinhua News Agency, Boston, September 15th: The "Christian Science Monitor" published several readers' letters on the 10th under the title "Readers Protest Far East Policy".

	A letter from James Warburg of Greenwich, Connecticut, said: "It is almost unimaginable that while our troops are still stationed in Lebanon, we are again on the verge of war with China over two small coastal island groups. These two island groups clearly belong to the mainland.

	"Let us imagine that after Cornwallis surrendered (note: Cornwallis was a British general during the American Revolutionary War who surrendered to American forces on October 19, 1781), Britain refused to admit that its defeat was a foregone conclusion, and to show its determination to return to the mainland, withdrew most of its troops to a fictitious island 100 miles off the mid-Atlantic coast of our country. Let us further imagine that the (British) Royal Navy and a few of King George's redcoats held on to Nantucket, Long Island, and the coral reefs off the coast of Florida, using these coastal islands as bases to disrupt American shipping and occasionally raid the mainland.

	"How long would our founding fathers have tolerated this situation?

	"Moreover, if (King of France) Louis XVI and his Foreign Minister Vergennes had not helped the American Revolution, but had decided to support Britain, unwilling to accept Britain's defeat, and had sent Rochambeau's fleet to help Britain defend its remaining island fortresses, what would the American people have thought of France? (Incidentally, according to Dulles' theory, (at that time) France's aid to the American uprising would be judged as 'indirect aggression.')

	"To what extent are we going to allow our government to be so shortsighted about our own real interests and so ruthlessly indifferent to the interests of humanity? Now is the time when true patriots must no longer remain silent but protest loudly."

	Norman Thomas of New York City wrote: "Worst of all is the callous or fatalistic attitude that allows Mr. Dulles to threaten to drag us into a war over Quemoy and send our sons to die for Chiang Kai-shek."

    美国人民不能看着政府玩火
    美报发表读者来信抨击政府侵略政策
    反对让美国人民的子弟为蒋介石送死
    据新华社15日讯　波斯顿消息：“基督教科学箴言报”10日以“读者抗议远东政策”为题刊载了好几封读者来信。
    康涅狄格州格林威治的詹姆斯·华伯的来信说：“几乎不可想像，在我们的军队还驻在黎巴嫩的时候，我们竟然为了两个小小的沿海岛群而再度濒于同中国发生战争的边缘。这两个岛群显然是属于大陆的。
    “让我们设想一下，如果在康沃利斯投降（按：康沃利斯是美国独立战争时期的英国将军，1781年10月19日向美国军队投降）以后，英国拒绝承认它的失败已成定局，而且为了表示它决心要重回大陆，把它的大部分军队撤到我国中部大西洋海岸一百英里外的一个假想岛屿上。让我们进一步设想，（英国）皇家海军和乔治国王的少数红衣兵士死守住南托克特、长岛和佛罗里达州沿海的珊瑚礁，利用这些沿海岛屿当作基地来干扰美国的航运和不时对大陆进行袭击。
    “那么，我们的开国祖先对于这种情况会容忍多久呢？
    “而且，如果设想法国国王）路易十六和他的外交大臣维尔惹纳不是帮助了美国革命，而是决定支持英国，不愿接受英国的失败，派了罗香波的舰队去援助英国保卫它剩下的岛屿堡垒，那么美国人民对法国会有什么想法呢？（附带说一句，按照杜勒斯的理论，（当时）法国对美国起义的援助会被判定是“间接侵略”。）
    “我们打算让我国政府对我国自己真正的利益近视到什么程度，对于人类的利益漠视到多么无情的程度？现在是如果真正爱国就不能再默认而要大声抗议的时候了。”
    纽约市的诺曼·托马斯来信说：“最糟糕的是那种麻木不仁或听天由命的宿命态度，听凭杜勒斯先生威胁要把我们卷入为了金门而发生的战争中，并且派我们的子弟去为蒋介石送命。”
