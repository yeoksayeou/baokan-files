Xinhua News Agency report: On the 9th, newspapers across the country published Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council in the most prominent positions. Workers, peasants, people from all walks of life, and the vast officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army land, sea, and air forces, who are vigilantly standing on the battle posts of defending the motherland, were all overjoyed to see the speech. They held discussions and study sessions, unanimously expressing their determination to counterattack the American aggressors with their practical actions in their respective posts. It is generally believed that Chairman Mao's incisive analysis of the domestic and international situation has greatly enhanced the confidence of the people throughout the country in the victory against American imperialism's aggression, truly boosting our morale and deflating the enemy's arrogance.

According to the countless vivid examples that emerged across the country on the 9th, Chairman Mao's speech has immediately transformed into a tremendous material force among the people of the whole country. From the Fujian front line to large cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, and Chengdu, as well as the vast rural areas that are in the high tide of the People's Commune movement, inspired by Chairman Mao's speech, people have gained infinite strength in production and in the struggle against the enemy, and have exerted even greater efforts. The officers and soldiers of our land, sea, and air forces on the Fujian front line, who are high in morale, expressed that if the American aggressors do not draw back from the brink, we will certainly strangle them with the noose they made themselves. Steelworkers in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places guarantee to shorten the smelting time and produce more steel to support construction and enhance national defense; peasants in Sichuan expressed their intention to deliver public grain as soon as possible, while striving for a greater leap forward in agriculture.

After seeing Chairman Mao's incisive analysis of the current domestic and international situation at the Supreme State Council, the artillery unit on the Fujian front line, which severely attacked Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops on Jinmen Island on the 8th, cheered on the position. They said: Chairman Mao has led us from victory to victory in the past. In the future, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we will resolutely smash the war provocations of American imperialism and liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan. They expressed great anger at the American invading army's repeated intrusion into our territorial waters. They said that as long as Chairman Mao gives an order, we will use artillery to issue a warning to the aggressors, and let their warships and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit warships be buried in the seabed like them. The torpedo boat unit that damaged and sank two American-made Chiang Kai-shek military ships on August 24th stated: If the American aggressors do not immediately withdraw their claws, we will resolutely chop them off. Air Force hero Liu Yuti said: The facts on the Korean battlefield proved that the United States is a paper tiger. Today, Chairman Mao's wise prediction has brought us infinite strength. In the future, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions and give the aggressors an even heavier blow.

These high-spirited soldiers were also extremely pleased with Comrade Khrushchev's warning to Eisenhower on behalf of the Soviet government. They expressed their gratitude to the Soviet government and people for their support of the just struggle of the Chinese people. Wang Jiafa, the captain of a torpedo boat squadron, said: Comrade Khrushchev has warned the United States that invading China is invading the Soviet Union. If the United States does not change its war policy, all its military bases and naval fleets will become targets for various rocket weapons, and the American monopoly capitalist group will, as Chairman Mao pointed out, be hanged by the people of the world.

The vast militia in Fujian Province have all wiped their gun barrels bright and polished their bayonets brightly, making all preparations to resist the aggressors. Day and night, they closely monitor the enemy's activities in coordination with the local garrison.

Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council greatly inspired the people of Shanghai. Today, the retail sales of Shanghai newspapers have increased by three and a half times compared with usual, reaching 530,000 copies. Everyone is vying to read the news of Chairman Mao's analysis of the domestic and international situation.

The Hudong Shipyard has recently completed twelve sets of converter steelmaking equipment with an annual output of 1.44 million tons of steel, and is now stepping up preparations to manufacture another ten sets of larger converters. The workers proposed: Producing one more ton of steel can eliminate a few more enemies who dare to invade.

The workers in the open-hearth furnace workshop of the Shanghai Third Steel Plant, which is famous throughout the country for its shortest steelmaking time and highest utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces, are determined to complete the overhaul of No. 1 open-hearth furnace at an unprecedented speed of forty-two hours, and strive to produce more steel to counter the provocations of the American aggressors. The Class A workers, who were supposed to go to work in the afternoon, automatically came to the workshop early in the morning. The Class B steelworkers, who had worked all night, were unwilling to go home to rest. A battle front was formed in front of No. 1 open-hearth furnace, where three shifts of steelworkers met.

After seeing Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council, the people of Sichuan Province are determined to double their practical actions on all fronts to counter the American aggressors.

In the discussion, more than 100,000 workers in Chengdu vowed to burn the American paper tiger to ashes with a torrent of steel. More than 4,000 employees of the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory just broke ground yesterday to build a steelmaking workshop. On the 9th, inspired by Chairman Mao's speech, they decided to complete the construction task 40 days ahead of schedule and put it into production.

Inspired by Chairman Mao's speech and Comrade Khrushchev's letter on the 9th, the steelworkers of the Chongqing Third Steel Plant shortened the smelting time of several furnaces by more than one hour compared with usual. Both open-hearth furnaces created a new record for the shortest smelting time since September 1st, and produced two more furnaces of steel than usual on the 9th, producing 60 tons of steel. The steel equipment that was originally scheduled to be completed by the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory on the 15th of this month was completed ahead of schedule on the 9th by the workers with soaring enthusiasm.

The vast number of cadres and masses of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Pixian County, where Chairman Mao had been, were extremely excited, and proposed the slogan of delivering public grain and selling unified purchase grain within ten days, and start delivering grain to the warehouse from tomorrow.

The Chengdu troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held discussions one after another, unanimously believing that Chairman Mao's speech and Khrushchev's letter to the United States have great significance, boosting our morale and deflating the enemy's arrogance, and have a major role in mobilizing the people of the whole country and the people of the world to oppose American aggressors. They all expressed their guarantee that the troops will be strong and well-equipped to severely hit the aggressors.

Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council greatly encouraged the people of Tianjin.

The workers of the Tianjin Steel Plant were very excited after seeing the newspaper on the 9th. Steelworker Lu Liang said that Chairman Mao's analysis has increased our strength. We must try to shorten the steelmaking smelting time as much as possible and produce more steel to strike imperialism.

The employees of the Tianjin Wool and Linen Processing Factory, who have formed the "Red Flag Battalion," unanimously expressed their support for Chairman Mao's speech at the meeting convened by the battalion headquarters on the 9th, and expressed that on the one hand, they must step up production in a fighting posture; on the other hand, they must step up military exercises, and immediately rush to the front line to eliminate the enemy once the motherland calls.

The workers of the Renli Woolen Textile Factory, who formed the "Production Battle Group," stated at the forum: Once the motherland needs them, they will immediately put down their production tools and rush to the front line to strike the enemy.

Representatives of all sectors of youth in Tianjin held a rally, unanimously severely warning the American aggressors.
