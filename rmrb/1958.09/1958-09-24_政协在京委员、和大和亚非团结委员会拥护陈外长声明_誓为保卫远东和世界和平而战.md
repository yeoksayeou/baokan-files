Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: Some members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in Beijing gathered today, angrily denouncing the United States for playing "ceasefire" conspiracies and continuing its arsonous crimes in the Taiwan area. They unanimously and firmly supported Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement refuting Dulles' speech at the United Nations General Assembly, expressing their determination to fight against aggression, safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, and defend the Far East and world peace.

In their speeches, the members pointed out that following Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait, Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement once again expressed the common voice of the 600 million people of the country, demonstrating the strong will and invincible power of the Chinese people marching towards socialism to liberate Kinmen, Matsu, Taiwan, Penghu and other regions. The members also expressed their full support for Chairman Khrushchev's two letters to Eisenhower. They said that these two letters demonstrated the great unity of the Chinese and Soviet governments and peoples and were a serious warning to the American aggressors who were setting fires in the Far East.

Shi Liang refuted Dulles' fallacies in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly. She said that Dulles' slander of our country as an "aggressor" at the United Nations General Assembly and his proposal for a "ceasefire" were completely a pack of lies that reversed black and white and deceived public opinion. American imperialism stole other people's things and said that they were robbers, which is extremely shameless. She warned American imperialism that this set of American imperialism cannot frighten or deceive anyone. We Chinese people love peace, but we are not afraid of war. If American imperialism dares to launch a war, we will resolutely fight back with war. Shi Liang said that although she is over fifty years old, as long as American imperialism dares to provoke a war, she will resolutely follow the Chinese People's Liberation Army to do everything that needs to be done and severely attack the enemy.

Chen Qiyou, in his speech, expressed strong protest against the increasingly rampant war provocations of American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait. He said that American imperialist planes and warships have violated our country's territorial waters and airspace ten times, and our government has given ten warnings. American imperialists should clear their heads, the tolerance of the Chinese people is definitely not unlimited.

Hu Ziang said that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement fully expressed the will of our 600 million people and exposed the conspiracy of American imperialism to play with "ceasefire." We must accelerate ideological transformation and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions. American imperialism is completely a paper tiger, and if it wants to set fire, destroy it.

In their speeches, the members all pointed out that no threat from American imperialism can scare the Chinese people's determination to liberate Kinmen, Matsu, Taiwan, and Penghu. Ji Fang said that members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party will, together with the people of the whole country, take practical actions to fight against aggression, safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, and wage a resolute struggle against American imperialism. Wang Yunsheng said that there have been facts in history of foreign aggressors occupying our country's Taiwan, but they have been thoroughly defeated under the heroic blows of the Chinese people. Now, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have become a powerful giant, and American imperialism's occupation of Taiwan will also suffer the same fate of failure. Ju Zan said that American imperialism, this paper tiger, pretends to be man-eating and carries out military provocations in the Taiwan Strait, but cannot see the power of the people of the world. The paper tiger cannot scare us. If we want to fight, we will fight. Justice is on our side, and victory must belong to us. Hou Jingru said that American imperialism's "playing with fire" cannot scare us. We must liberate Kinmen and Matsu and never waver. I am a former soldier, and I will be ready to listen to the call of the motherland at any time, go to the front line, and contribute my strength to liberate our country's territory.

Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and more than 30 members of the committee in Beijing attended today's meeting. Chu Tunan, Standing Committee Member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, presided over today's meeting. Tao Menghe, Zai Tao, Wang Xueying, Zhou Shiguan, Cheng Ximeng and others also spoke at today's meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: The China Peace Committee issued a statement supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement, severely condemning Dulles' shameless slander and the new provocative actions of American imperialism. The statement from the China Peace Committee said: While agreeing to negotiations, the American aggressors are stepping up their military provocations and war threats against our country. Dulles even demanded that our country "cease fire," wanting the Chinese people to give up their sacred right to recover Kinmen, Matsu, and other coastal islands and liberate Taiwan. Everyone knows that there is no war between China and the United States, and there is no question of a "ceasefire" at all. The only issue at present is the issue of the United States stopping "playing with fire," and the issue of the complete withdrawal of American armed forces from the Taiwan Strait. If the US military does not withdraw from Taiwan, there will be no peace in the Far East, and the tense situation in Asia and the world will not be eased. Therefore, the Chinese people's struggle cannot stop for a day until the United States withdraws from our territory Taiwan and stops its aggression against China.

The statement also said: If American imperialism dares to impose war on the Chinese people, we, the united and long-struggling 600 million Chinese people, will rise up and vow to fight to the end to defend the motherland, oppose aggression, and defend the Far East and world peace!

Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: The Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee today issued a statement supporting Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement refuting Dulles' speech at the United Nations General Assembly and the Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev's repeated warnings to Eisenhower.

The statement said that the United States has occupied our country's territory Taiwan, and recently gathered a large number of troops in the Taiwan Strait, continuously violating our country's airspace and territorial waters, and frantically carrying out military provocations and war threats against our country. This action of American imperialism is not only an aggression and provocation against China, but also an open challenge to the Bandung spirit and a serious threat to peace in Asia and the world.

The statement added that American imperialism has repeatedly created tense situations and intensified its aggression in the Asian-African region. It has tried every possible means to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea and Vietnam; openly supported armed rebels in carrying out activities to subvert the Republic of Indonesia, armed intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon, and delayed the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon and the Middle East, and threatened the security of the Republic of Iraq, etc. Now, it is carrying out aggression and provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait. The increasingly barbaric acts of aggression by the United States against China and the people of Asian and African countries prove that it is not only the sworn enemy of the Chinese people, but also the common and most ferocious enemy of the people of Asian and African countries.

    政协在京委员、和大和亚非团结委员会拥护陈外长声明
    誓为保卫远东和世界和平而战
    新华社23日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会在京的部分委员今天集会，愤怒斥责美国玩弄“停火”阴谋和继续在台湾地区进行放火的罪行。他们一致坚决拥护陈毅外交部长驳斥杜勒斯在联合国大会上发言的声明，表示决心要为反抗侵略、维护祖国的主权和领土完整、保卫远东和世界和平而战。
    委员们在发言中指出：继周恩来总理发表关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明以后，陈毅外交部长的声明是再一次讲出了全国六亿多人民共同的呼声，显示了向着社会主义迈进的中国人民为解放金门、马祖、台湾、澎湖等地区的坚强意志和不可战胜的力量。委员们在发言中并表示完全拥护赫鲁晓夫主席给艾森豪威尔的两封信。他们说：这两封信显示了中苏两国政府和人民伟大的团结，是对美国侵略者在远东放火的严重警告。
    史良在讲话中驳斥了杜勒斯在联合国大会上发表的谬论。她说，杜勒斯在联合国大会上诬蔑我国为“侵略者”，并提出什么“停火”的主张，这完全是颠倒黑白、欺骗舆论的一派胡说，美帝国主义抢了人家的东西反说人家是强盗，真是无耻之极。她警告美帝国主义说，美帝国主义这一套吓不倒任何人，也欺骗不了任何人。我们中国人民爱好和平，但也不怕战争，如果美帝国主义胆敢发动战争，我们就坚决用战争回击它。史良表示她虽然已年过五十，但是只要美帝国主义胆敢挑起战争，她就坚决跟随中国人民解放军做一切所需要作的工作，狠狠打击敌人。
    陈其尤在发言中，表示强烈抗议美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区日益猖獗的战争挑衅活动。他说，美帝国主义的飞机和军舰已经十次侵犯我国的领海和领空，我国政府已给了十次警告。美帝国主义的头脑应该放清醒点，中国人民的容忍绝对不是没有限度。
    胡子昂说，陈毅外长的声明充分表达了我们六亿多人民的意志，揭穿了美帝国主义玩弄“停火”的阴谋。我们必须加速思想改造，以实际行动来支援解放台湾的斗争。美帝国主义完全是个纸老虎，如果它要放火，就把它毁灭掉。
    委员们的发言中都指出：美帝国主义的任何威胁都吓不倒中国人民解放金门、马祖和台湾、澎湖的决心。季方说：中国农工民主党成员将和全国人民一起，以自己的实际行动，为反抗侵略、维护祖国的主权和领土完整，和美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。王芸生说，历史上不是没有外国侵略者侵占我国台湾的事实，但是他们在中国人民的英勇打击下，都遭到了彻底的失败。现在中国人民在党和毛主席领导下已成为一个强大的巨人，美帝国主义侵占台湾，也将同样地遭到失败的下场。巨赞说，美帝国主义这只纸老虎装做吃人的样子，在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅，看不见世界人民的力量。纸老虎是吓不倒我们的，要打就打，正义在我们这一边，胜利一定是属于我们的。侯镜如说，美帝国主义“玩火”吓不倒我们，我们一定要解放金门、马祖，绝不动摇。我是一个旧军人，我将随时听候祖国的召唤，走上前线，为解放我国的领土贡献出自己的力量。
    出席今天集会的有政协全国委员会副主席陈叔通和部分在京委员三十多人，政协全国委员会常务委员楚图南主持了今天的集会。在今天会上发言的还有陶孟和、载涛、王雪莹、周士观、程希孟等。
    据新华社23日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会发表声明，拥护陈毅外交部长的声明。严厉谴责杜勒斯的无耻谰言和美帝国主义新的挑衅行为。和大的声明中说：美国侵略者一边同意谈判，一边加紧对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。杜勒斯竟然要求我国“停火”，要中国人民放弃收复金门、马祖等沿海岛屿和解放台湾的神圣权利。谁都知道，中国和美国之间并没有发生战争，根本谈不上“停火”，目前唯一的问题，是美国停止“玩火”的问题，是美国武装力量全部从台湾海峡地区撤出的问题。美军不撤离台湾，远东就不会有和平，亚洲和世界的紧张局势就不会得到缓和。因此，美国一天不撤出我国领土台湾和停止对中国的侵略，我国人民的斗争一天也不能停止。
    声明还说：如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，我们团结一致和久经斗争锻炼的六亿中国人民将奋身而起，誓为保卫祖国、反对侵略和为保卫远东和世界和平而战斗到底！
    新华社22日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天发表声明拥护我外交部长陈毅驳斥杜勒斯在联合国大会上发言的声明和苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫对艾森豪威尔的再次警告。
    声明中说，美国侵占了我国领土台湾，最近又在台湾海峡地区集结了大量兵力，连续侵犯我国领空领海，疯狂地对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。美帝国主义这种行动不仅是对中国的侵略和挑衅，而且也是对万隆精神的公开挑战，严重地威胁亚洲和世界和平。
    声明又说，美帝国主义在亚非地区一再制造紧张局势和加紧侵略活动。它千方百计地阻碍朝鲜、越南的和平统一；公开支持武装叛乱分子进行颠复印度尼西亚共和国的活动，武装干涉黎巴嫩的内政和拖延从黎巴嫩和中东撤军，并威胁伊拉克共和国的安全等。现在，又在台湾海峡地区对中国进行侵略和挑衅。美国对中国和对亚非各国人民越来越野蛮的侵略行为，证明了它不仅是中国人民的死敌，而且也是亚非各国人民共同的、最凶恶的敌人。
